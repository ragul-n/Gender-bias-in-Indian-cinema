1
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:30,876
(In French) Morning.

2
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,250
Hello,
Can I speak to Mr Manohar from India?

3
00:04:33,501 --> 00:04:34,501
Ok, who are you?

4
00:04:34,751 --> 00:04:36,584
I'm Meyyappan calling from Indian Embassy.

5
00:04:36,999 --> 00:04:40,501
I want to talk to Mr. Manohar regarding
 his bail procedures. Can you call him?

6
00:04:40,584 --> 00:04:41,792
Ok, just a second.
- Yea sure.

7
00:04:42,167 --> 00:04:44,250
Manohar. Cell No - 125

8
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:46,459
Manohar is playing football.

9
00:04:46,667 --> 00:04:48,083
Who is next?

10
00:06:04,501 --> 00:06:05,334
Manohar!

11
00:06:06,709 --> 00:06:07,334
Come here.

12
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,000
You got a call from India.

13
00:06:10,209 --> 00:06:10,751
I know.

14
00:06:10,876 --> 00:06:13,000
It's my friend P Raja
regarding my bail.

15
00:06:13,167 --> 00:06:14,959
Manohar your Engilsh is too fast.

16
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,459
We speak French here.

17
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:17,542
Talk slowly.

18
00:06:18,626 --> 00:06:20,083
My English... very fast?

19
00:06:20,209 --> 00:06:20,626
Yea!

20
00:06:20,792 --> 00:06:21,375
Damn.

21
00:06:21,626 --> 00:06:23,792
Wish my English Teacher was here to hear this.

22
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:25,209
Said I can never speak English.

23
00:06:25,459 --> 00:06:27,375
Ok, Ok. I will talk slowly.

24
00:06:28,501 --> 00:06:30,000
So now, will you please tell me,

25
00:06:30,334 --> 00:06:32,000
how did you shoot this goal?

26
00:06:32,584 --> 00:06:33,584
With this foot.

27
00:06:33,876 --> 00:06:34,918
That's not funny.

28
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:36,334
That was hard brother.

29
00:06:36,584 --> 00:06:37,834
The reason why I'm asking is,

30
00:06:37,999 --> 00:06:41,000
this goalkeeper is a real good goalkeeper.

31
00:06:41,209 --> 00:06:43,876
No one hits a goal while he is standing.

32
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:45,792
So that's why tell me.

33
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,417
How did you hit this goal?

34
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,167
I imagined my girlfriend as goalkeeper.

35
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:55,459
I got fired up.

36
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,000
Smashed right through it.

37
00:06:57,209 --> 00:06:57,918
Goal!

38
00:06:58,167 --> 00:06:59,709
You imagined your girlfriend?

39
00:07:00,042 --> 00:07:00,626
Yep.

40
00:07:01,459 --> 00:07:02,626
Is your girlfriend your enemy?

41
00:07:03,709 --> 00:07:06,375
For all the boys, girlfriend is their first enemy.

42
00:07:06,709 --> 00:07:07,459
I agree.

43
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:10,584
You want to know the full story?

44
00:07:10,792 --> 00:07:11,125
Sure.

45
00:07:11,542 --> 00:07:12,792
But I will tell only in English.

46
00:07:12,918 --> 00:07:13,584
Ok. Go ahead.

47
00:07:13,751 --> 00:07:15,334
I'm not responsible if you don't get it. Come.

48
00:07:16,459 --> 00:07:19,542
In India, there is one amazing state called TamilNadu.

49
00:07:19,834 --> 00:07:22,918
In TamilNadu, there is a beautiful city called Chennai.

50
00:07:23,167 --> 00:07:25,042
In Chennai, there is GN Chetty Road.

51
00:07:25,334 --> 00:07:28,167
There only me and my friend Raja
working in car company.

52
00:07:28,459 --> 00:07:31,834
He is penance for some deity always,
because he swears a lot.

53
00:07:31,876 --> 00:07:32,334
Hello.

54
00:07:32,501 --> 00:07:33,209
What's up, darling?

55
00:07:33,501 --> 00:07:34,876
Facebook, darling.
- YouTube, darling.

56
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:35,501
Cut it.

57
00:07:35,751 --> 00:07:37,584
Come immediately to the office.
We've got an issue.

58
00:07:37,876 --> 00:07:40,167
I've got a bigger issue here.
Got into a brawl, you know?

59
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:42,375
Let it be.
You must be here in the next 5 minutes.

60
00:07:42,542 --> 00:07:45,000
Do I look like The Amazing Spiderman?

61
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:46,792
You s...

62
00:07:47,042 --> 00:07:47,834
Saamy Saranam!

63
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:51,375
Look, I'm in penance to the Saamy.
Don't play with me.

64
00:07:51,542 --> 00:07:52,876
I'm not the Lord but the devil.

65
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,542
Get lost.

66
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:55,626
Darling... darling.

67
00:07:55,792 --> 00:07:57,000
I was just kidding.

68
00:07:57,542 --> 00:07:59,751
Couldn't think of a counter so he disconnected.
- What's up, P Raja?

69
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:01,125
Any tiff with your girlfriend?

70
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:02,918
Would you like me to connect you two?

71
00:08:03,667 --> 00:08:05,209
Starts with What's up,
wants to be WhatsApp.

72
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,209
Go you lousy dash.

73
00:08:06,417 --> 00:08:10,417
If you curse me,
I'll ask Kuthalam Sir to cut off your promotion.

74
00:08:10,667 --> 00:08:12,876
Anyways, that rhino is gonna say no.

75
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,000
Out you dirtbag.

76
00:08:14,501 --> 00:08:15,999
Get lost you M...Mustard.

77
00:08:17,501 --> 00:08:18,959
We've been in this Office for so long.

78
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:21,542
Doesn't even know my name. Calls Raja as Mustard.

79
00:08:22,209 --> 00:08:22,876
Saamy Saranam.

80
00:08:22,999 --> 00:08:23,999
Hey is that not a cuss word?

81
00:08:24,834 --> 00:08:27,042
Maybe she thought I wouldn't catch that?

82
00:08:27,334 --> 00:08:28,667
What happened with your brawl?

83
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:31,417
A family got into trouble with a ruffian.

84
00:08:31,584 --> 00:08:33,167
I gave him an offer he couldn't refuse.

85
00:08:33,876 --> 00:08:36,209
Vito just turned in his grave.

86
00:08:36,501 --> 00:08:37,209
Pardon, darling?

87
00:08:37,501 --> 00:08:39,999
Nothing darling.
Someone must have hacked my mouth.

88
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:42,459
Pissed at me?

89
00:08:42,667 --> 00:08:43,250
Yep.

90
00:08:44,209 --> 00:08:45,375
Let it slide, darling.

91
00:08:45,667 --> 00:08:47,042
For the launch of the new model,

92
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:50,083
a foreign model is here,
in the guise of a Manager.

93
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:50,918
Super!

94
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:53,542
You have a chance to settle in foreign now.

95
00:08:53,751 --> 00:08:54,501
Saamy Saranam.

96
00:08:54,709 --> 00:08:55,918
Stop joking, darling.

97
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:58,250
She has banned Ayudha Poojai in our Office.

98
00:08:58,918 --> 00:09:00,417
She has banned Ayudha Poojai?

99
00:09:00,542 --> 00:09:01,918
- Yep.
- What is this darling?

100
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,667
Peta came in and banned Jallikattu.

101
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:05,751
Now Rita comes in and bans Ayudha Poojai?

102
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:07,042
What is wrong with this place?

103
00:09:07,167 --> 00:09:10,083
To keep away all the wrong spirits,
we do Poojai.

104
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,125
She says it'll spoil the car's looks.

105
00:09:13,501 --> 00:09:14,584
Where is the Kung Fu Panda?

106
00:09:14,709 --> 00:09:15,125
Who?

107
00:09:15,334 --> 00:09:17,542
Kuthalam Chidambaram. Our Manager.
He's finished today.

108
00:09:17,667 --> 00:09:18,667
Excuse me guys.

109
00:09:19,417 --> 00:09:21,876
Down.
- (In Unison) Good morning Manager, Sir.

110
00:09:22,792 --> 00:09:24,375
We were slagging you off just now.

111
00:09:24,501 --> 00:09:24,999
Sorry?

112
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:26,792
Why are you apologizing Sir?

113
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:29,375
Hey I'm not saying 'I'm Sorry',

114
00:09:29,792 --> 00:09:31,209
I'm saying 'Sorry?'

115
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:35,626
Sir you trying to perform like John Wayne
but it looks like Adam Sandler.

116
00:09:35,792 --> 00:09:37,000
Hey!
- Hey.

117
00:09:37,751 --> 00:09:39,417
That woman hasn't agreed
to Ayudha Poojai.

118
00:09:39,542 --> 00:09:40,667
Run off now.

119
00:09:40,876 --> 00:09:41,751
We'll celebrate another day.

120
00:09:41,876 --> 00:09:42,501
Come dar...
- Sir!

121
00:09:43,042 --> 00:09:45,125
Is this Vijay awards
to change the date all the time?

122
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,501
- Is that you?

123
00:09:46,667 --> 00:09:48,167
Ayudha Poojai can't be postponed.

124
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:49,584
Did you speak to her, Sir?

125
00:09:49,834 --> 00:09:51,999
Hey see... You know my Focabulary of English.

126
00:09:52,209 --> 00:09:53,584
Saami Saranam!
- He's not swearing.

127
00:09:53,834 --> 00:09:55,000
His wretched pronunciation.

128
00:09:55,167 --> 00:09:56,959
I try my best but no chance.

129
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,626
Sir, Take me to her.

130
00:09:58,834 --> 00:09:59,667
No its not my work.

131
00:09:59,876 --> 00:10:00,918
Sir!

132
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:03,501
Take me to her and I'll request for Ayudha Poojai.

133
00:10:03,667 --> 00:10:07,459
He doesn't even know to read the word English.
What would have been his conversation?

134
00:10:07,626 --> 00:10:08,626
What a model!

135
00:10:08,876 --> 00:10:10,459
Two tops on her.

136
00:10:10,918 --> 00:10:12,000
- Saamy Saranam.
- Saamy Saranam.

137
00:10:13,334 --> 00:10:14,792
Can we speak to her, Sir?

138
00:10:15,417 --> 00:10:16,542
Start the conversation, Sir.

139
00:10:16,792 --> 00:10:18,334
I don't permit all this kinda stuff in...

140
00:10:18,501 --> 00:10:19,334
Excuse me Ms Rita,

141
00:10:19,501 --> 00:10:20,209
I'll just call you back.

142
00:10:20,876 --> 00:10:22,209
Yes, Mr Kuttala Chadambaram.

143
00:10:22,501 --> 00:10:24,209
Nah... Kuthala Chidambaram.

144
00:10:24,334 --> 00:10:24,542
Ok.

145
00:10:24,834 --> 00:10:27,083
Because pronounciation is very important,
you know?

146
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:27,751
Sorry.

147
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:28,501
It's okay.

148
00:10:28,834 --> 00:10:30,751
By the by, he's my boy Mr Mano.

149
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,000
2 minutes talk to you?

150
00:10:32,542 --> 00:10:33,250
Go ahead.

151
00:10:34,209 --> 00:10:35,999
In your culture, God resides in Church.

152
00:10:36,167 --> 00:10:38,709
Your country God stay for only Church.

153
00:10:40,417 --> 00:10:42,334
But here,
He resides in all the places of work.

154
00:10:42,501 --> 00:10:45,167
Our country God staying in every places.

155
00:10:45,334 --> 00:10:48,792
You will look at the cars,
machines, spare parts as things.

156
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:53,250
You will looking car, machine, spare parts.
Everything you see only for things.

157
00:10:53,626 --> 00:10:56,083
But we see it as a life that sustains families.

158
00:10:56,334 --> 00:11:00,209
We will see all things
of our total rice in our family.

159
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:02,709
When we return from war,
having carried weapons (Ayudham) for the nation...

160
00:11:02,918 --> 00:11:05,209
Our country weapons take the war...

161
00:11:05,584 --> 00:11:06,834
Sir!

162
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:08,501
This is the crux of the matter.

163
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:09,792
I'll handle this please.

164
00:11:09,999 --> 00:11:11,334
Please shut it Sir.

165
00:11:11,876 --> 00:11:13,000
You mean Shut up?

166
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:16,876
Returning from war,
having carried weapons (Ayudham) for the nation,

167
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,584
Not only are the soldiers decorated
but their weapons too!

168
00:11:19,751 --> 00:11:21,584
Ayudha Poojai celebrates that tradition.

169
00:11:21,792 --> 00:11:26,125
To stop our traditional Ayudha Poojai,
no Rita has any rights.

170
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:26,876
Yes.

171
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,083
Total damaged.

172
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:29,918
Rita, hasta la vista!

173
00:11:30,667 --> 00:11:31,792
Yes Mr Kuttala Chadambaram.

174
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:33,000
Kuthala Chidambaram.

175
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,250
Already I'm told.

176
00:11:34,459 --> 00:11:35,876
Pronunciation is very must.

177
00:11:35,999 --> 00:11:36,751
Ok Ok.

178
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:37,999
Mr Manohar,

179
00:11:38,501 --> 00:11:41,876
Now I understand your cultural aspects
and feelings.

180
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,250
You can start celebrating your Poojai now.

181
00:11:44,542 --> 00:11:45,167
Thank you, Rita.

182
00:11:45,334 --> 00:11:46,834
Right now, I love you baby.

183
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:48,834
Proud of my child.

184
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,501
Let the celebrations begin!

185
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:16,209
A thoroughbred Middle Class,
Un-tethered from status’ claws.

186
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:19,083
All my people are welcome anytime,
We make friends in no time.

187
00:12:19,209 --> 00:12:24,375
Marvel, at Mr. Local!

188
00:12:24,626 --> 00:12:30,000
Hey, marvel at Mr. Local!

189
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:32,999
Our hood is known for hospitality,

190
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:36,209
Forget blood, friends show loyalty.

191
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:41,459
Marvel, at Mr. Local!

192
00:12:41,751 --> 00:12:47,250
Hey, marvel at Mr. Local.

193
00:13:04,792 --> 00:13:07,584
Helping out during a calamity,
We don’t count it as charity.

194
00:13:07,709 --> 00:13:10,626
When trample on our right,
Remember, we don’t back out of a fight.

195
00:13:10,792 --> 00:13:13,250
Work for the heart’s fill, not for the pay,
Sorrows won’t wipe our smiles away.

196
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:16,334
Struggles don’t put us down, we compete,
Ain’t nothing out there, we can’t beat.

197
00:13:16,626 --> 00:13:21,959
Never cared for dad’s money,
We earn our own penny.

198
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:27,626
We aren't impressed by Benz,
money can't buy you friends.

199
00:13:27,834 --> 00:13:33,000
Marvel, at Mr. Local!

200
00:13:33,209 --> 00:13:36,042
Make way, Make way,
Make way, Make way…

201
00:13:36,209 --> 00:13:39,083
He’d never let your faith sway.

202
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,834
Make way, Make way,
Make way, Make way…

203
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,375
Everyone's favourite is out to slay.

204
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:07,918
Our ragged motorcycle,
Keeps us ever cheerful.

205
00:14:08,209 --> 00:14:13,709
Our phones maybe costly,
But we still want our Wi-Fi complimentary.

206
00:14:13,999 --> 00:14:19,334
Every bit of EMI,
Steal our wallets, on the sly.

207
00:14:19,918 --> 00:14:24,959
Welcomed by a trumpet,
One day, we’ll walk the Red carpet

208
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:30,792
In the depth of our hearts,
Worries have no slots.

209
00:14:31,042 --> 00:14:36,459
No matter the obstacle,
The brave find a way to tackle.

210
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,000
We gift our families, our labour.
We’d gift our parents, our life.

211
00:14:42,167 --> 00:14:47,459
Local, Mr. Local!

212
00:14:47,876 --> 00:14:50,667
A thoroughbred Middle Class,
Un-tethered from status’ claws.

213
00:14:50,876 --> 00:14:53,542
All my people are welcome anytime,
We make friends in no time.

214
00:14:53,751 --> 00:14:58,834
Marvel, at Mr. Local!

215
00:14:59,209 --> 00:15:04,584
Hey, marvel at Mr. Local!

216
00:15:04,751 --> 00:15:07,834
Our hood is known for hospitality,

217
00:15:07,999 --> 00:15:10,751
Forget blood, friends show loyalty.

218
00:15:10,918 --> 00:15:16,000
Marvel, at Mr. Local!

219
00:15:16,417 --> 00:15:21,999
Hey, marvel at Mr. Local!

220
00:15:31,834 --> 00:15:36,542
(Singing) "Girl, I'm ready to marry you,
gather around for the feast"

221
00:15:36,751 --> 00:15:38,083
You don't sing it that way, baby.

222
00:15:38,209 --> 00:15:38,959
Then how do I sing it?

223
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:49,000
(Singing) "I'm done waiting for you, girl.
Should I go monastic? And become a priest?"

224
00:15:49,459 --> 00:15:52,167
Why?
Shouldn't I sing taking her to a honeymoon?

225
00:15:52,417 --> 00:15:53,876
Why so much hate brother?

226
00:15:53,999 --> 00:15:55,250
I'm frustratedly single.

227
00:15:55,459 --> 00:15:57,125
Stop whining, pick up the phone.

228
00:15:58,167 --> 00:15:59,167
Who's that at this hour?

229
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:00,999
Well, it's our guy.

230
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:02,000
Hi Surendar!

231
00:16:02,167 --> 00:16:03,125
My name is Sundar.

232
00:16:03,334 --> 00:16:04,000
Doesn't matter.

233
00:16:04,334 --> 00:16:05,501
Is it ready?

234
00:16:05,709 --> 00:16:06,709
Perfectly ready.

235
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,209
Is it a killer?
- Yes!

236
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:10,417
We are on our way to pick it up.
- Come soon.

237
00:16:10,584 --> 00:16:11,626
I'm driving. Bye.

238
00:16:12,459 --> 00:16:12,999
Baby!

239
00:16:13,167 --> 00:16:13,751
Yes, baby.

240
00:16:13,876 --> 00:16:15,626
You wished for a cake
on your mom's birthday right?

241
00:16:15,792 --> 00:16:16,209
Yes.

242
00:16:16,459 --> 00:16:19,000
Our guy Surendar has killed it.

243
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,792
We'll pick it up first.

244
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:21,542
What say?

245
00:16:21,709 --> 00:16:22,334
Super!

246
00:16:22,459 --> 00:16:25,709
There goes my ex.
- Lying again.

247
00:16:26,501 --> 00:16:28,209
What's up Suresh?
- I'm Sundar.

248
00:16:28,417 --> 00:16:28,876
Hey..

249
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,751
If I catch it right,
are you gonna become Jeff Bezos?

250
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:32,918
Slouching here.

251
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,999
Go fetch our cake.

252
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:35,584
Can't bring it here. Come around.

253
00:16:35,792 --> 00:16:37,125
Okay, go.
We'll follow.

254
00:16:38,334 --> 00:16:39,834
Hey, stop flirting with my friend.

255
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:40,417
Go away.

256
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:41,167
Dude, come here.

257
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,667
Baby, same coloured T-Shirt.
They asked for Same Pinch Chocolates.

258
00:16:43,834 --> 00:16:45,959
Swear on it.
- Let it slide.

259
00:16:48,834 --> 00:16:49,542
How's that?

260
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:50,999
What is this?

261
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:53,000
A bed for you two?

262
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,083
Size doesn't matter.

263
00:16:55,667 --> 00:16:57,083
The matter of it matters.

264
00:16:57,209 --> 00:17:00,083
("I can fly higher than an eagle,
For you are the wind beneath my wings")
Original lyrics for you.

265
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,167
Card or cash?

266
00:17:02,501 --> 00:17:03,125
How much is this?

267
00:17:04,792 --> 00:17:07,584
Had it been an outsider,
Sudagar will ask for 30 Thousand.

268
00:17:07,751 --> 00:17:08,667
But special price for us.

269
00:17:08,834 --> 00:17:10,417
250 Rupees?
- No. 23 Thousand Rupees.

270
00:17:10,584 --> 00:17:11,209
Good Lord!

271
00:17:11,542 --> 00:17:12,751
Are you alright?

272
00:17:12,918 --> 00:17:14,584
I've told him you own a car showroom.

273
00:17:14,876 --> 00:17:17,209
It's just 23 Thousand, inclusive of taxes.

274
00:17:17,542 --> 00:17:19,125
Close the deal, fast.

275
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:20,250
What say?

276
00:17:20,584 --> 00:17:21,999
This shop won't be worth that money.

277
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,667
23 Thousand for a cake is too much.

278
00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:28,876
"Birthday wishes, Yours dearest
Manohar (alias) Mano"

279
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,751
- What's he doing?
- Wait, I'll talk to him.

280
00:17:31,042 --> 00:17:32,459
Hey, what's wrong with you?

281
00:17:33,626 --> 00:17:34,459
Do me a favour.

282
00:17:34,667 --> 00:17:37,000
Put your name there
and gift it on your granny's birthday.

283
00:17:37,999 --> 00:17:40,125
We just partied yesterday
for my Granny's birthday.

284
00:17:40,334 --> 00:17:42,626
It'll return next year.
Keep it in the fridge till then.

285
00:17:42,792 --> 00:17:45,167
A bigger fridge to take this in
will cost you 100 Thousand.

286
00:17:45,417 --> 00:17:46,959
Where will I find that money?

287
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:49,501
Sell your vehicle. Buy a fridge.
Gift it next year.

288
00:17:50,959 --> 00:17:52,334
This is beyond belief.

289
00:17:52,876 --> 00:17:55,334
You are wiping out the livelihood of Tamils.

290
00:17:56,042 --> 00:17:58,417
One day, TamilNadu will cease to exist.

291
00:18:00,459 --> 00:18:00,999
What?

292
00:18:01,501 --> 00:18:01,999
Say What?

293
00:18:02,709 --> 00:18:03,083
Speak up.

294
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:04,000
Nope.

295
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:06,167
You don't stop ever. Now speak up.

296
00:18:07,792 --> 00:18:09,501
Any reply will get you in trouble.

297
00:18:10,501 --> 00:18:12,667
Alert during election time, huh?

298
00:18:13,667 --> 00:18:14,375
Bro!

299
00:18:14,959 --> 00:18:15,959
You are forgot the cake!

300
00:18:16,501 --> 00:18:18,834
I'll cut something else for my mom.
You enjoy this cake.

301
00:18:18,959 --> 00:18:20,209
- Hello!
- Give it to him please.

302
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,083
Panda looks pissed!

303
00:18:25,459 --> 00:18:26,167
Sultan!

304
00:18:28,209 --> 00:18:32,083
Write your name "Surya Prakash" in this cake,
and gift your mom. Deal?

305
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,751
I gotta pick up school kids.

306
00:18:33,999 --> 00:18:35,876
I have to go far. See you.
Bye.

307
00:18:36,167 --> 00:18:38,459
Don't eat it all by yourself, share it.

308
00:18:39,209 --> 00:18:40,999
Let me go.
- Stop. Pay for it.

309
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,280
Hello, who is this?

310
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,840
It's me, Malaysia Madhavi.

311
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,960
You won't be in peace with your husband ever.

312
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,720
What do you mean?

313
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:57,120
I'm flying from Malaysia to Chennai,
to destroy you.

314
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,720
(laughs hysterically)

315
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:05,160
Was little late coming back from temple
and I missed so much?

316
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,720
Divya

317
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,560
Hey, Divya!
- Mom, what now?

318
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,760
Will Madhavi fly from Malaysia?

319
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,200
No, her flight will go missing

320
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,240
Boo!

321
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,880
You Monster.

322
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,240
I was not born to a mother but to a monster.

323
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,200
Give me five!

324
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,960
Mom, he just called you a monster
and you are laughing

325
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,760
He tried a joke.

326
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:28,440
Mom!

327
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,080
Yep.

328
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,320
Close your eyes for a moment.

329
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,520
Surprise?

330
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,920
Surprise! You know everything. It's a good one!
- Slow claps.

331
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,280
He'll take you to cut cake.

332
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,680
Get out.
- Get lost.

333
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:39,560
Let's go.

334
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,360
I've closed my eyes.
You have to guide me.

335
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,880
Such dedication to the role.

336
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:43,840
What a family!

337
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:44,520
Go on.

338
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,640
Will you keep surprising after your wedding?

339
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,160
Definitely ma,
for my wife.

340
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,480
For me?
I'll try mom. Now close your eyes.

341
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,960
Ready?
1, 2, 3... Tada!

342
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:56,920
Wow!

343
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,640
Divya come here!
Come here ,come fast!

344
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,840
I've seen birthday celebrations with cake.

345
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,640
But "Mysore Paaku" ?

346
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,640
Thank you mom, thank you.
- Mom.

347
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,720
Will anybody cut Mysore Paaku?

348
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,880
This is over the top.

349
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,160
- Hey...
Won't you tell him, ma?

350
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,120
My son will always have a reason
behind his actions.

351
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:15,680
Yep

352
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,760
What's the reason?

353
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,040
What will I say now?

354
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,560
- Come on.
- Ma! Cake was invented by the British.

355
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,120
It is not from Tamil culture.

356
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,960
That's why I'm celebrating with Mysore Paaku.
Got it.

357
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,840
But, Mysore is in Karnataka.

358
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,600
But this was made by Krishna Sweets
which is in Chennai.

359
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,440
Ma, she is a dissenter.

360
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,320
She's inciting violence.

361
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,680
Look, College kids shouldn't talk politics.

362
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,440
Who said so, mom?

363
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,080
Not me.

364
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,960
I don't know either, you are trapping me
Please cut this.

365
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:51,120
- (Singing Happy Birthday in English)
- (Singing Happy Birthday in Tamil)

366
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,240
Hey hey... take a selfie please

367
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,960
Quickly.
- Ok, Ok.

368
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,320
I've never asked you anything on my birthday.

369
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,960
I have a wish now.

370
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,400
What's that? Wanna be a granny next year?

371
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,440
You said you won't marry this year.

372
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,720
I never said that.

373
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,840
Oh... I shouldn't be friends with Auto Sekar.
Is it not?

374
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,840
You won't listen to me, even if I wish it.

375
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,040
Then what is your wish?

376
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,720
My dear...

377
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,160
You know "Valli" from "Kungamam" TV Soap?

378
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,960
"Kungumam" Show, "Valli"... yea.

379
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,960
I like her so much.

380
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,960
I want to take a photo with her.

381
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:33,280
If I put that on FB,
I'll be famous in this colony.

382
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,720
Famous?

383
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,040
Just a picture, dear.
Get it done please.

384
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,120
Mother Easwari!

385
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:43,240
Thou shall attain your wish by tomorrow's dusk.

386
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,120
Darn this helmet.

387
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,560
Ma!
No.

388
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,880
People are looking at us weird.

389
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:55,480
Mom.

390
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,040
People look weird
of those who follow rules.

391
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,680
Safety is paramount.

392
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,600
- Yes mom,
- Son...

393
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,720
I'm gonna see Valli!
I can't handle the entertainment.

394
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,120
Mom, that's not entertainment.
That's excitement.

395
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,400
Some "Ment".

396
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:17,080
Shall we buy some sweets and flowers?
- Are we gonna ask her hand?

397
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,480
Ma! Ma!...
God!

398
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,680
Let me help you.

399
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,160
Slowly... Are you alright?

400
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,320
Yea, I'm fine.
- Wait here.

401
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,320
Hey wait up.

402
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,440
You... Hey.
- Hey, come out.

403
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,720
Was watching a Tik Tok video on whatsapp,
didn't let me finish it.

404
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,480
Ok, take out all your documents.

405
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,400
Are you gonna laminate for me?

406
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,160
Do I look like a photocopier?

407
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,320
I'm a servant of the government.
Police Department.

408
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,520
I know Mr Mayilvaganam.

409
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:49,680
He crashed into us.
And you are questioning us?

410
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,720
- Ok, wait I'll handle this.
- That's your job.

411
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,280
- What's going on?
- Are you fine, Mom?

412
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,240
Sir... Hello

413
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:56,920
Sir!

414
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,880
Are you borrowing some sugar
from your neighbor?

415
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,040
Be bold, Sir.

416
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,360
Hello Sir... Sir!

417
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,040
Tinted windows are outlawed.

418
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,480
Didn't you see our website?

419
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,520
Tamilnadupolice www dot dot...

420
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,760
Why are you rambling?
Leave it.

421
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,320
I'll handle this.
Hey, step out.

422
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,080
Out.

423
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,240
By Mid-June I'll be coming to Paris.
- Mano! Mano!

424
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,960
What happened?

425
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,160
Think you can get away,
because you are beautiful?

426
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,920
- I'm going to..

427
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,680
What are you mumbling there?
Say it to my face. Face to face.

428
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,720
She's on a call.
- Roya, I'm in the middle of something, I'll be right back.

429
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:44,640
Ok then
- Sir!

430
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,040
What happened? Any problem?

431
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,320
Problem?

432
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,080
Let her speak.

433
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,760
Yes you are letting her speak.

434
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,240
I'm not at fault here.
Signal was on green.

435
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,960
Check CCTV if you'd like.

436
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,960
Neither did we do any wrong.
Even we had green signal.

437
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:58,920
Check CCTV if you'd like.

438
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,960
Alright, let's go check the TV.

439
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:01,680
A moment.

440
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,840
That won't work out.

441
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,160
Neither of you are at fault.
We are guilty.

442
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,960
Some signal problem.

443
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,640
What is this nonsense?

444
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,640
Let's not waste time here.
Come, let's go.

445
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,080
Hey,trying to escape are we?

446
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,640
You were over-speeding.

447
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,880
You made the crash.

448
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,440
Better apologize now.
Or you ain't going anywhere.

449
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,120
Why should I ask sorry?

450
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,400
Mr Mayilvaganam,
whatever it is I'll face it legally.

451
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,960
Nonsense.

452
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,960
Look at her arrogance, mom.

453
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,760
She just walked out. I'll...

454
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,560
She's gonna be sorry for this.

455
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,320
Hey!

456
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,560
Did you note down the number?

457
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:38,680
No?

458
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,640
Write it down. Fancy number.
Quite easy.

459
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,120
Damn you...

460
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,520
Get permission for Valluvar Kottam Sir.

461
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,120
I want all media there with a live relay.

462
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,320
Pardon?

463
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,400
Hello Sowmiya.

464
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,120
If you aren't here in 10 minutes,

465
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,240
You'll see only my corpse.

466
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,840
Thought I'll cry out like this?

467
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,960
Dare not see you
singing in musically with her.

468
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:06,880
Cut.

469
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,600
How's that?
Fantastic Beardo!

470
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,920
Thank you.
- Now fix Sowmiya up.

471
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,240
Sir?
- Fix her salary up.

472
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,880
That's your job Sir.

473
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,840
Sign up for a new show
in office tomorrow.

474
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,960
Thank you so much Sir.
- Just kidding.

475
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,480
My sworn enemy.

476
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,360
Hello Madam, madam.
Help me out.

477
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,320
Mam, I'm diabetic.
Please help me.

478
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:29,960
Hi Mam.

479
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:30,760
Hi.

480
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,840
Morning Mam.
Hi Sir.

481
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,400
My mom.

482
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,200
Hi Aunty.
- Birthday...

483
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,480
Happy birthday Aunty!

484
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,960
Shake hands.
Thank you, Thank you

485
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,320
Not just me,

486
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,480
our entire colony is...
- Crazy...

487
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,480
Huh?
...about you.

488
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,480
Take a picture son.

489
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,440
No, I asked you to come
during lunchtime.

490
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,880
You have come after the break.

491
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,560
We got haunted on the way.
What?

492
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,680
I'll tell you later, Mam.

493
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,120
Just a picture Mam.

494
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,120
- We can't take a pic?
- She'll pose wait...

495
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,680
Alright.

496
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,080
Should I post this on Facebook,
as is?

497
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,640
Increase the brightness here.

498
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,080
Also, change the contrast...

499
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,640
Look there.

500
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,280
You there?

501
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,840
Why is she here?

502
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,560
I have figured out who she is.

503
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:29,560
In Kungumam show,
Madhavi harasses Valli over the phone.

504
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,880
That's her.

505
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,400
Come.

506
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,680
We'll sort her out.
Yep.

507
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:37,960
Oye!

508
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,960
You ran away from asking sorry.

509
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,760
That's why God has sent you here.

510
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,960
Apologize now.

511
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,160
Otherwise you'll face the consequences.

512
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,520
I should apologize?
Me?

513
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,840
Do you know who I am?

514
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,960
That's not who I am,
"Who am I?"

515
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:53,960
Jackie Chan Movie.

516
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,560
We saw it in Woodlands remember?

517
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,840
Lakshman Uncle!

518
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,920
Yes madam.

519
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,360
These guys are meddling with me,
without knowing me.

520
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,560
Don't push me.
- Cool, Madam.

521
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,640
I'll handle it.

522
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:06,960
Hey...

523
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,960
Do you have any idea what's happening?

524
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,760
Do you know who she is?

525
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:11,920
We know Laksman Uncle.

526
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:12,400
Who?

527
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,480
The one who calls Valli from Malaysia
everyday.

528
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,600
Villian of the show. Name is Madhavi.
Divorcee.

529
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,440
She ain't married yet.

530
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,280
What can I do?

531
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,760
Watch your words.
- Uncle!

532
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,480
What's happening?
- Sorry Madam.

533
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,520
She is the producer of this show.

534
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,120
CEO of KV Entertainment.

535
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:27,880
MD.

536
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,200
Keerthana Vasudevan.

537
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,040
Got it?

538
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,640
Cat got your tongue?

539
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,360
Keerthana Vasudevans shouldn't apologize?

540
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,560
You have two horns?

541
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,600
Who let these local guys in shooting spot?

542
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,760
Are you filming Avatar
for the International crowd?

543
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,320
Shut up, you halfwit.
- Ok you dumbwit.

544
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,400
Stop spraying please.

545
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,240
Keerthu Mam, in our Kungumam show,

546
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,400
there's an up and coming artist Sowmiya,

547
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,520
they have come to meet her from some ditch.

548
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:53,920
Sowmiya!

549
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,560
Madam...

550
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,520
Told you we were haunted...

551
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,480
Here's the devil.

552
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,920
Sorry madam.

553
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,840
They are my guests.
- Oh...

554
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,040
They have to be out in 2 minutes.

555
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,520
It's your responsibility.

556
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,880
Otherwise I'll call the cops.

557
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,480
I'll give you the same 2 minutes.

558
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,560
Apologize to my mom.
Otherwise I'll call the FBI.

559
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,160
Why are you calling the banks?

560
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,920
Mom, it's Police from America.

561
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,360
Mano, please.

562
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,520
I'll apologize on Madam's behalf...

563
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,400
Please go away.

564
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,960
Let it go.

565
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,720
I'm sparing her for your kind heart.

566
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,720
But I have few things to say.

567
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,600
Look,

568
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,960
Do you know who she is?

569
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,760
"The Lady Superstar" of TV.

570
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,760
Look how humble she is.

571
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,760
After all, you are a producer

572
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,480
Look at the arrogance on you.

573
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,600
Mano...
Stop creating a ruckus.

574
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,360
Please stop talking.
- Madam Listen,

575
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,720
You don't know your popularity.
We are Sowmiya's fans.

576
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,880
We'll pay people to
troll you on Social Media.

577
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:52,960
Do they pay for this?
Yes they do mom.

578
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,600
Please Sir.
- Sowmiya Madam,

579
00:28:54,880 --> 00:29:00,400
when you are at leisure,
teach her some manners.

580
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,160
Learn from her.

581
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,160
Let's go Mom.

582
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,120
Yes let's go.

583
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,440
Are you a star?

584
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,240
I'll write you off the show.

585
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,200
Mind it.

586
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,120
Sorry madam.
- Sir! Sir...

587
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:13,960
Mam...

588
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,320
Also...

589
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,440
Don't glare often.

590
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,320
It's quite disturbing.

591
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:23,960
Understood?

592
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,520
Think on it.

593
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:38,200
To all my Walking mates in the colony,
Good Evening.

594
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,600
Are you surprised at this gathering?

595
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,040
I took a photo with Valli
on Kungumam Show shooting.

596
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,680
I got 100 Likes on Facebook!

597
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,480

599
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:56,960
This is my personal record in
5 years of Facebook.

600
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,960
You guys made this happen.

601
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,680
Thank you so much.

602
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,920
Hey Mano!

603
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,680
Come here.
- No can do.

604
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:09,600
Why?

605
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,080
You come here.
I'm hungry

606
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,720
Only 2 minutes Son, come here.

607
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,680
You are still here, shame.

608
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,680
The first reason behind this record,
is my son.

609
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,280
Thanks dear.
Mom people are watching, behave.

610
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,960
Speak a couple of words to them.

611
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,960
I'll make dinner for you
- Couple of words?

612
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,080
Just a couple.

613
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,320
Show's over people.

614
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,320
Go watch Breaking News, go.

615
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,680
That's their routine.
Will they not be bored?

616
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,960
Mom, to make it interesting
they play music to news.

617
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:40,880
That's right.

618
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,120
Are you guys not moving?

619
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,600
No refreshments here, disperse.

620
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,280
Go feed your kids.

621
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,240
You wanna dodge cooking and order online.

622
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,560
I'll take my bike later.
Keep moving.

623
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,720
Mano Mano...
- Yes?

624
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,480
I would love to take a pic with
Pepsi Uma on my birthday.

625
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,840
Can you do it for me?

626
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,680
Pepsi Uma?

627
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,120
Just a picture, please.

628
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,960
Were you in a coma for 20 years?

629
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:06,600
You are not in the mood today.
- Mood?

630
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,280
She is out of trends.
- Yes ma.

631
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,560
Excuse me Mr Mano...

632
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,640
What do you want?
- Can I have tea with DD?

633
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,200
Huh?

634
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,200
Can you help me?

635
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,280
Tea with DD... DD...
- Say what?

636
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:19,160
He means to say Coffee with DD.
- That's right

637
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,480
You want tea, with DD?

638
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:24,240
Tomorrow, you go to State Bank,

639
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,920
give them this 100 Rupees.

640
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:29,120
Take a DD (Demand Draft) for 90 Rupees
have a tea with the change.

641
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,680
Tea with DD.

642
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,560
Ok? Move on...

643
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,160
I think you are not in a good mood.

644
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:37,200
Don't talk to me about mood.
Jog on.

645
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,320
I'm in trouble because of you mom.

646
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,960
What?
Wanna meet Ma Ka Pa Anand?

647
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,400
I don't need any pictures.

648
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,920
Sowmiya is here to meet you.

649
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:45,600
Huh?

650
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:46,760
Sowmiya!

651
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,440
Where?

652
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,520
There in her car.

653
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,560
Hi Sowmiya!

654
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:01,240
Your fans are thronging the shooting sets,
trying to take pictures,

655
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:04,600
you have grown real quick!

656
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:08,480
This show won't suit you anymore.

657
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,960
With your large fan following,

658
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:14,520
you can explore Kollywood, Tollywood,
Bollywood, Hollywood.

659
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,280
Madam...

660
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,120
Here's your termination agreement
and severence pay.

661
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,440
Don't forget them on your way out.
Ok?

662
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,480
All the best.

663
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,400
For your actions, I've lost my career.

664
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:31,960
We'll meet Keerthana tomorrow,
clarify your innocence,

665
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,920
and get you back on the show.

666
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,360
That would be a great help Madam.

667
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,720
Don't worry.
Be strong.

668
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,680
Thank you Madam.

669
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,480
We were 10 minutes late.

670
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,640
That's a mistake. I admit.

671
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:52,720
You can talk to them, warn them
or even deny a day's pay

672
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,080
But how can she fire her?

673
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,480
Such arrogance!

674
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,320
I don't care what you would do,

675
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:05,520
But I can't bear to watch anybody
except Sowmiya on that show.

676
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,440
I'm talking to you, son.
What are you fiddling there?

677
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,960
I think he's playing PubG.

678
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,880
I'm serious here and you are looking at...
Mom, mom... look.

679
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:17,320
Keerthana's office address,
phone number, email id, Facebook id

680
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,520
I'm taking half a day's leave,

681
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,480
We'll put Valli back under the spotlight

682
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,240
Baby.

683
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,600
Remember to act like a Northerner.

684
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:31,840
Watch me perform.
- Welcome Sir, Good morning.

685
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,320
(In Hindi) Namaste child.

686
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,040
Namaste child!

687
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,840
"Can I meet keerthana..."

688
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:41,840
(In gibberish Hindi) Can we meet
Katy Perry?

689
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,960
Keerthana Vasudevan.

690
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,480
(In Hindi) Madam is busy in a meeting.

691
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,920
(In Hindi) May I know who you are?
- Oh!

692
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,920
Did you get it?
- Nope.

693
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,200
Actually,

694
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,160
Sir is from a National Party,

695
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,720
madam wished to join them.

696
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,920
He's come all the way from Delhi to meet her.

697
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,200
Tomato lorry travelling... tired.

698
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,400
One second Sir

699
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:07,840
I'll call her.

700
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:10,080
(In broken Hindi) I love this show!

701
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,680
Shut up now.

702
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,120
Keeping it casual, bro.
- Hello.

703
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:13,920
Yea Sheetal.

704
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,960
Guests have come from Delhi to meet you Mam.

705
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,200
- From Delhi?
Yes Mam.

706
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:18,840
Okay, give the phone to them.

707
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,680
Sir, Mam on the line.

708
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,080
Hello, It's Manohar here Mam.

709
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,640
Which Manohar?

710
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:25,840
Manohar mam...

711
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,080
We had an accident near the signal..

712
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,160
Oh.. you.
What do you want?

713
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,320
I have something important to tell you.

714
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,040
Can you spare 5 minutes please?

715
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,280
Stop it

716
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,400
I have the whole day to myself.
But I don't have 5 minutes for you.

717
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,680
And one more thing.
Just get out of my office right now.

718
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,120
What baby?

719
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,720
Is she coming out to meet us?

720
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,160
Said "Get out of my office".

721
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,080
Meaning?

722
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,720
Get the hell out of here.

723
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,320
They have no manners.

724
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,600
Let's get out.
- Are you a friend?

725
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,360
Why?

726
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:00,520
Had it been my friend P Raja here, he would have
cooked up a clever idea to meet her.

727
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:03,200
Look.. Never...
- What?

728
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,960
Never compare me with him.

729
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,280
What do you want?
To meet her, right?

730
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:07,960
Yes.

731
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,120
Always with P Raja...

732
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,080
Forget keerthana...

733
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,600
You've got mail
P.S I love you

734
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:16,960
Got it?

735
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,360
Brother, you are scaring me.

736
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,840
Why don't you go meet Manager Lakshman Sir?

737
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,040
Speaking Tamil now?

738
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,160
Brother...

739
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,960
You clock at Gudvancherry Toll Gate,
don't you?

740
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,880
If you are at Reception, you'll be all airy?

741
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,440
Damn your landlines.

742
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,520
What will you do with that?
- Check on Granny.

743
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,240
She's building a house.

744
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,960
Excus...
How rude. There's an elder in.

745
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,640
He is Lakshman Uncle.

746
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:45,200
Looks like a Globe perched on a sofa.
Posturing...

747
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,960
- Vanakkam Sir.
- Vanakkam Sir.

748
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,960
Hey, who let you in?

749
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,320
The door was open Sir.

750
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,280
So you'll just walk in?
- Sir, forgive me Sir.

751
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,160
Oh God! Stop pleading with me.

752
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,520
I've forgiven, get up.
- No Sir

753
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,880
Ask him to get up.
- He's already up.

754
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,160
What's he searching for?
- My age is your experience, Sir.

755
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:06,840
True.

756
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,680
But I was disrepectful to you Sir.
- That's true

757
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:15,280
I deserve no redemption Sir.

758
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,120
No redemption...

759
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,480
Why are you crying now?
Ask him not to cry.

760
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,720
Sir, he's laughing.

761
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,960
No, I'm crying for real.

762
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,240
He's crying.

763
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:29,160
Sir, tell him you have forgotten everything.
He'll stop crying.

764
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,920
- Everything?
- Yes Sir... Tell him.

765
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,040
I have forgotten everything.
- What's your name Sir?

766
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,440
Lakshmanan.
- See he didn't forget anything.

767
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,440
No I've forgotten our dispute.

768
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,440
Please don't cry.

769
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:41,280
Sir.

770
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,360
You look like my...

771
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,360
Uncle?
- No Sir

772
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,520
You look like my brother!

773
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,840
Brother?

774
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:50,880
What happened?

775
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,680
- A fly flew into my nose Sir.
- It shouldn't.

776
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,720
I'll let them know.

777
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,720
Brother...

778
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,360
What do you want?
To go meet Madam and apologize, right?

779
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,240
Let's go.

780
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,120
Stop chattering... kid.

781
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:01,960
- Sorry?
- ...Brother.

782
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:02,680
Yes, brother!

783
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,680
What was he watching?

784
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,280
Watching NSFW videos.

785
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,880
Excuse me, Keerthu Madam.

786
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,320
Sorry for disturbing you.

787
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,520
Manohar, here.

788
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:12,560
This guy?

789
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,680
Why did you bring him?

790
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,120
Didn't say I can't meet him?

791
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,480
Regretting the incident on shooting spot earlier,

792
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,320
he begged apology from me.

793
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:19,920
So?

794
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,280
So, he wanted to apologise to you too.

795
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,280
Brought him along.

796
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:24,800
2 minutes Madam.

797
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,280
Please, you listen to me.

798
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,360
Ok Ok, only 2 minutes.

799
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,600
Make it fast.

800
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,160
Be smart with your apology.
Your brother will be outside.

801
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,040
Good luck.

802
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,440
Madam, if you are miffed with me,
punish me.

803
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,520
Why is that actor taking the heat?

804
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,320
Poor thing.

805
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,320
Get her back on your show.

806
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,160
It's in everybody's interests.

807
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,600
Came in to say this.

808
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:49,480
Good bye.

809
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,320
My parents have named me Manohar.

810
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,960
You can call me the same.

811
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,520
Snap at your slaves.

812
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,120
Never... at me.

813
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,280
Is the owner of KV Entertainment,
your grandfather?

814
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,280
Your father?

815
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,440
Or is it you?

816
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,320
Issuing commands here.

817
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,320
Listen...

818
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,680
This is my company.

819
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,440
My show.
My staff.

820
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,880
I will have my way.

821
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,240
Who are you to question me?

822
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,240
Keerthana Vasudevan,

823
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,600
you are educated but you barely understand.

824
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,520
The show is watched for that actor.

825
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,880
Not for you or your KV Entertainment.

826
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,880
Better get her back on the show.

827
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,760
Or, you have doomed the show.

828
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:34,760
Hey,

829
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,920
came in with the pretence of apologising,
now you advise me?

830
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,160
Your time is over.
Out.

831
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,720
Kungumam show must have Sowmiya as Valli.

832
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:47,680
Dare you replace her with a Ramya or Mozorella.

833
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,480
You are finished.

834
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,080
Do your worst idiot, get out.

835
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:54,120
Shame, she has no respect.

836
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:57,520
Where are your parents? Let's have a PTA.

837
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,560
Dare you speak about my parents.

838
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,240
So let's talk about your grandparents.
Now what, girl?

839
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,440
I didn't intend on touching you.

840
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,120
I'll go now.

841
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,960
Do what I said and this episode ends today,

842
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,680
or it drags on for years like your TV Soaps.

843
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,200
Did you get it?

844
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,720
What's your perfume?

845
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,680
Smells like you are walking
along with me.

846
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:01,960
What happened to Valli?

847
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,640
What happened to Kungumam?

848
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,160
What happened to Keerthana?

849
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,760
What happened to you?

850
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:10,040
You sound like my mother
watching a cliffhanger.

851
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,120
- Sorry?
- Keerthana got angry with Valli.

852
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,560
Valli got angry with me.

853
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,240
I got angry with Keerthana.

854
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,440
It's too confusing.
I can't understand.

855
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,680
I'll tell you in detail.

856
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,640
That day it was Asha's birthday.

857
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,640
Who is Asha now?

858
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,040
Our office Aishwarya Rai

859
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:23,680
What the hell?

860
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,440
Not for me,
for my manager Kuthala Chidambaram.

861
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,280
Fat boy.

862
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,920
He used to say that
she is the Aishwarya Rai of our office.

863
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,440
Oh!

864
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,360
That day what happened, know?

865
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,800
Asha's birthday today.

866
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,320
How do I impress her?

867
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,480
Let's try a video call.

868
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:46,480
(Imitating Nic Cage - We are here to ruin ourselves
To break our hearts and love the wrong people)

869
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,320
The one who should be in a cage.

870
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:52,640
She can't stand my happiness.
Blockhead...

871
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,760
Hello
- Blockhead? Whom do you mean?

872
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,960
Not you, I meant Mano, Raja.
Stupid fellows.

873
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,320
What's up?
Haven't you started?

874
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,480
No, not yet dear.

875
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:03,440
Doctor's appointment at 4.30,
asked you to be with me.

876
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,040
Kept nodding in the morning,
have you forgotten?

877
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,520
No dear. So busy in the office.

878
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,480
Can't leave for 2 hours.

879
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,040
Please understanding.

880
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:14,520
Why don't you take your mother?
- My mother?

881
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,760
It's been two years since she passed.

882
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:19,120
I'll see you in the evening.

883
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,320
It's been two years since she died?

884
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,200
I'm dead.

885
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,240
Wish she went along with her mother.

886
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,680
She never lets me be happy.

887
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,040
(In unison) Excuse me, Sir.

888
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:28,640
Hey...

889
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,560
May I come in, Sir?

890
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,080
Already you came here.

891
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,080
Stupid questions, idiots.

892
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:36,360
Sir seems angry.
Did your wife call, Sir?

893
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,360
Or, did Asha not call you Sir?

894
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,080
None of your business.
Ok?

895
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,960
Yes, it is between you and Asha.

896
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,720
Exactly, exactly exactly.

897
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,200
That’s 50 Thousand.

898
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,400
Put it in FD under Asha’s name.
- Fixed Deposit, Sir?

899
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,040
That’s good.

900
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,320
Account?
- I’ll send the account details on Whatsapp.

901
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:53,360
This transaction…?
- Should be kept secret because...

902
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:57,640
You are the manager,
can't do few things by your hands.

903
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,920
Also, you have an image to maintain.

904
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,920
Very good job, right now you go out.

905
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:02,600
Ok Sir.

906
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:03,400
You stand.

907
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:04,320
Sir?

908
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:05,800
You go.
- Sorry, Sir.

909
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:06,560
Hey!

910
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:07,960
You stand.

911
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:08,960
You go.

912
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:09,920
Country fool.

913
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,640
God save us from his English.

914
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,560
Works in a car company, idiots.

915
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:17,480
Is this for another girl?
- Mind your words, Mr Mano.

916
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,560
Is this for another staff, Sir?
- That's good.

917
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:22,080
Gift voucher for Asha from me.

918
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,760
That culprit shouldn't know this.

919
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,600
This is part of job description now.

920
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:27,120
What?

921
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,400
Nothing Sir. Asha is here, Sir.
- How?

922
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:30,320
Smell.

923
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,320
Smell?

924
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,680
Perfume smell, Sir.

925
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,160
How about you?
- Yea, I’ll apply now.

926
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,800
Good luck for your intent, Sir.

927
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,480
Hi Ashu.
Talk to me.

928
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,440
Many more happy returns of the day, my dear.
- Thank you Sir.

929
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,880
Won’t you gift me today, Sir?

930
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,640
I have a surprise, in private.

931
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:06,680
Small or a big one?

932
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,280
Not a small one.

933
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,360
Tell me more Sir.
- Excuse me Sir, look here please.

934
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:14,960
Lighting is better there,
go take a selfie.

935
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:15,800
Sorry Sir.

936
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,280
No pictures in the office,
no posts on Facebook.

937
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,520
I don’t like that.
Strictly prohibited, got it?

938
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:22,400
Yes Sir.

939
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,360
Why? Can we not take a picture with you?

940
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:29,040
Won't you do this for me?

941
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:29,880
Shame.

942
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,160
No Aishu.

943
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:35,960
I’ll snap with my own cellphone.
And I'll post it at the right time.

944
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:39,200
Ok? Ok? Ok?

945
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:41,280
Its getting slippery, people.

946
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,320
- Cake Sir, cake.
- Cake was getting slippery.

947
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:45,320
Be clear.
He said that, Sir.

948
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:47,920
You look like a father-daughter duo.
- I’ll slap you.

949
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,720
Management skills: infidelity

950
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:51,800
Come on, darling.

951
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:52,520
Hold my hand.

952
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,480
Sir, a picture…?

953
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,800
Never lets go.

954
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:58,160
Hold this.

955
00:43:58,360 --> 00:43:59,720
Sir? You don’t want this?
- Take a photo.

956
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,240
Sure.

957
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,800
Hey, there’s no light here.

958
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,080
You, lazy lout...

959
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,200
You can’t hold a meeting.
At least, hold a torch.

960
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,640
What is this?

961
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:10,360
Go on.

962
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:11,320
Be useful.

963
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,320
Will the light even make a difference?
- Hold it up.

964
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:14,280
Say cheese.

965
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,960
Cheeeeeese.

966
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:17,760
Sir, cut the cake.

967
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,480
Sir, give Asha some cake.

968
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,680
Asha now give him some cake

969
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,400
Sir now kiss Asha.

970
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:27,160
Sorry Sir, I got carried away.

971
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:28,360
Why did you stop there?

972
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,160
Sir, light?
- Turn it off.

973
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:32,600
Come, leave them alone.

974
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:35,120
Happy Birthday sweetheart!

975
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:35,680
Sir!

976
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,520
- Yes?
Mano has a question for you.

977
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,160
What now?

978
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:41,360
Shall I put it on FB?

979
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:41,960
Sorry?

980
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,640
Shall I put it on FB?

981
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,320
Why are you yelling?
Go ahead.

982
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:53,600
Birthday celebration with Asha doll.
- Tag Asha.

983
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:54,960
Posted.

984
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,960
Mano, guard said police is waiting for you.

985
00:44:58,800 --> 00:44:59,760
Police?

986
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:19,560
There’s an enquiry, get in the car.

987
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:21,800
Enquiry?

988
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:25,560
Sir are we dissenters, Anti-Social
or Urban Naxal elements?

989
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:26,680
Why is there an enquiry?

990
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,960
He wants to know the proper reason, Sir.

991
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:30,920
You have touched the untouchable.

992
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:32,920
Dude, where did you touch?

993
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:33,920
What’s that?

994
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:36,800
Get in the car by yourself.

995
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:38,920
You have 2 minutes.

996
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:40,240
I just need a minute, Sir.

997
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:41,640
Darling, let’s take a short trip.

998
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:43,520
This is not a loo break.

999
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:45,360
I can’t come along.
- Are you a friend?

1000
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:49,080
Had it been Auto Sekar here,
he would have taken a bullet for me.

1001
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:51,720
- Why are you comparing me with him?
- How about comparing him with you?

1002
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:54,280
Let’s go.

1003
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:59,440
Say your flashback in four shots.

1004
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,480
Have mercy on him Vignesh and Shiva!

1005
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:07,440
You’ve got into a big trouble,
why didn’t you tell me?

1006
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:08,760
You were in Mount Sabarimalai.

1007
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,560
How can I inform you?

1008
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:11,240
Duck...

1009
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:14,120
This penance chain
is distorting my cuss words.

1010
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,280
Why are you sharing now?

1011
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:19,040
If I’m thrown into prison,
I would need some company.

1012
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:22,720
We’ll have Comrades Seeman
and Mansoor Ali Khan there. But they are Seniors.

1013
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:24,440
Can’t have the comfort level, I have with you.

1014
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:25,960
So tagging you along.

1015
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,720
Saying it like we are heading to Bangkok.

1016
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,640
I haven’t even seen her.

1017
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:32,160
Why should I go to jail?

1018
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:33,240
Are you even a friend?

1019
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,360
You’ll start with sekar now.

1020
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,520
“He’ll take one on his cheek
He’ll take one on his d…”

1021
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:40,600
Sssshhh...

1022
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,960
Oh Muruga!
Arogara, Arogara!

1023
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:44,800
Muruga,

1024
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,200
Prasanna Kumar.

1025
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:47,680
Yes Muruga,

1026
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:49,680
Where are you taking my darling?

1027
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:55,280
This is Keerthana Vasudevan.

1028
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:58,640
The event begins at 6 PM sharp.

1029
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:00,760
That accused…
What’s his name?

1030
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:02,320
Manohar.

1031
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:03,960
Should be there by 6.15.

1032
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:07,960
On my signal, he runs towards the stage.

1033
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:10,920
There, our PA will try to stop him.

1034
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,240
Becomes a little chaotic.

1035
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:17,760
“Madam, just need 2 minutes from you”,
he pleads.

1036
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:24,920
I’ll turn to my PA
“Leave him, let’s hear what he has to say”.

1037
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,040
PA let’s go of him.

1038
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,760
He then comes on stage.

1039
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:31,960
Touches my feet, wishing me.

1040
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:37,120
Confesses to all the things
that happened in the office, in detail.

1041
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:38,320
And apologizes.

1042
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:40,960
Apology?

1043
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:46,480
Auditorium is on the left.

1044
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:49,320
If you give her the apology, you can live.

1045
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,040
Collector’s office on the right.

1046
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:56,960
There you’ll be asked to run. And shot.
Branded as an outlaw.

1047
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:58,480
Sir let’s go home, take a U Turn.

1048
00:47:58,640 --> 00:47:59,960
No U turns in this case.

1049
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,560
Do you wanna live or die?

1050
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,120
Left or right?

1051
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:05,120
You have 20 seconds time.

1052
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:07,120
Your time starts now.

1053
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,680
Muruga, why are you even thinking?

1054
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,040
Choose left, quick.

1055
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,400
At least show a left sign.

1056
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:25,640
Sir will understand.

1057
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:28,520
Sir, let’s go left.

1058
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:29,600
Go right.
- Stop, stop.

1059
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,520
Sir he meant left, Sir.

1060
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:32,960
Take a left please.
- Go left.

1061
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:39,040
(KV Entertainment has completed 5 years today.)

1062
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:43,040
(We're having a grand celebration!)

1063
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:48,680
Woah!

1064
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:54,480
(A few words to describe Keerthana Mam
would be, loyalty, dignity, morality, humane...)

1065
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:57,080
What?

1066
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:58,440
Why are you tickling Sir?

1067
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:01,040
That’ the signal.
Time for your apology.

1068
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:03,360
Apology…
(Madam you are a true inspiration for all of us)

1069
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:05,360
(Please share a few words with us)

1070
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:06,640
Madam!

1071
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,560
Stop him… stop.

1072
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,760
Hey Kungumam show, catch him!
- Hey stop… stop.

1073
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:14,800
Madam...

1074
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,720
I won't let you.
- Madam, I have few things to say.

1075
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:19,040
Am I talking to you? Let her decide.

1076
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:21,440
2 minutes madam.
I'll be quick.

1077
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:23,960
Uncle, he wants to say something.

1078
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,600
Let’s hear him out.

1079
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:33,680
Wow!

1080
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:37,160
"Thoppul Kodi", "Manjal Kayiru",
"Ariyatha Vayasu"...

1081
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:38,320
Watch it!

1082
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:39,760
That's an adult film.

1083
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,120
I meant "Pinju Manasu"

1084
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,120
Take their numbers.
- I won’t.

1085
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:43,880
Why?

1086
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:44,520
#MeToo

1087
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:47,920
For my mother,
she would love to call them.

1088
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:50,560
Please give your numbers. You can trust him.
He’s in penance.

1089
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,120
Hello, I’m your fan since I was a kid.

1090
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:54,040
Get up.

1091
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:55,680
Number…?
- Get up!

1092
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:00,920
Is he gonna begin a party?
- Another one?

1093
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:02,920
Would you like to join him?
- Why not?

1094
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:06,240
Madam...

1095
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:07,960
please ask them to give me a mic.

1096
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,880
When I apologize, you'll hear it, they will hear it.

1097
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,400
But I want the whole of TamilNadu to hear it.

1098
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,240
What’s gonna happen now?

1099
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:20,960
Do you have show material for this month?
- Nope.

1100
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:22,520
You’ll have it now.
- Let’s see.

1101
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:25,160
Carnival at your place?

1102
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,160
I’ll come next week.
Don't smile now.

1103
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:30,640
What's up, people!

1104
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:33,240
Ok ok.

1105
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,520
Just testing the mic, Madam.

1106
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:39,680
Dignifying the stage,
we have a relic,

1107
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:41,960
a mannequin,

1108
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:45,320
and a nun
straight out of the Conjuring Universe.

1109
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:50,680
Also the dumb scientist from
all the Bruce Willis movies.

1110
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:54,080
Mainstreaming sleazy content is
Mangalyam Ravi.

1111
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:55,640
Thanks!
- Look at his pride!

1112
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:58,560
Members of the TV fraternity,

1113
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:03,120
Brothers, Sisters, Friends,

1114
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:05,800
And my dear fans...

1115
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:07,800
Cut the crap.

1116
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:11,080
Not to forget, Crappy Uncle Lakshman,

1117
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:12,680
Last but not the least...

1118
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:14,320
The gorgeous,

1119
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:15,480
the intelligent,

1120
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:16,440
the proud,

1121
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:17,400
the talented,

1122
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:18,480
the majestic,

1123
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:19,600
the stylish…

1124
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:23,280
Daring the Bollywood heroines…

1125
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:25,720
we have,
Keerthana Vasudevan.

1126
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:31,480
I welcome you all,
in this momentous occasion.

1127
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,480
Round of applause, please.

1128
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:35,880
Madam...

1129
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:37,680
I came to your office.

1130
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:40,120
Without your permission,
I entered your room.

1131
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:42,320
With nobody around,

1132
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:44,520
when you were alone,

1133
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:47,320
I laid a hand on you, Madam.

1134
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:50,160
Way to go, stud!

1135
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,320
Woot! Woot!

1136
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:54,600
I'm sorry, madam.

1137
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:56,320
I don't understand.

1138
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:58,160
Is that a double entendre?

1139
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:01,040
No, no secondary meaning.
I was direct.

1140
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:07,560
Please forgive me Madam.

1141
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:11,920
At first, I didn’t feel anything...

1142
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:12,920
- Uncle!
- Madam..

1143
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:16,480
- I only realized it later...
- The other day, he grabbed my hand right?

1144
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:17,960
- Yes.
- Tell him to talk about that.

1145
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:20,080
He’s rambling.
- On it.

1146
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,720
I'm apologizing with such respect,
I believe you'd return it.

1147
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,760
Don’t you have stage manners?

1148
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:25,360
No Sir.

1149
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:28,240
You pushed madam in office remember?

1150
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:29,600
Apologise for that.

1151
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:32,040
Sorry Sir.
Thanks for the reminder.

1152
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,080
I’ve told him madam.

1153
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:37,320
I apologized to Madam
for laying a hand on her.

1154
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:42,920
But for provoking me,
madam would like to apologize now.

1155
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:45,400
- He flipped it, mam.
- That was the message relayed.

1156
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:47,560
Who would be so magnanimous?
Am I right?

1157
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:48,240
Yes.

1158
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:51,080
Round of applause.
Let's hear some energy!

1159
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:58,800
You crashed into my bike.

1160
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:00,800
You fired the actor.

1161
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:04,600
When I intervened for her,
you tried to hit me.

1162
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:06,160
You have caused all the trouble.

1163
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:09,400
But I need to touch your feet
and apologize?

1164
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:11,480
Go to h...
- Hey!

1165
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:13,680
Is what I should rightfully say.

1166
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:15,920
But I’m not angry at you.

1167
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:17,520
Have no idea why.

1168
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:19,920
Maybe...

1169
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:58,440
Hassles and hustles abound

1170
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:03,240
heaving them all towards their end,

1171
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:07,160
Along you came, leaving me spell-bound

1172
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:10,880
blaring out a new trend.

1173
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:15,520
Slow down damsel,

1174
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:19,760
My heart's in a dandle,

1175
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:23,760
Girl can we chat up?

1176
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:27,680
Easy now, don't flare up.

1177
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:29,760
Here goes my Glitzy Daisy,

1178
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:31,760
Making my knees go shaky,

1179
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:33,920
Tempting to get clifty,

1180
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:35,880
With you, I'll be crafty.

1181
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:37,920
Here goes my Glitzy Daisy,

1182
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:40,120
Making my knees go shaky,

1183
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:42,040
Tempting to get clifty,

1184
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:44,520
With you, I'll be crafty.

1185
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,200
Your blush is a splendor,

1186
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,200
when flush with anger.

1187
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:06,360
When I'm all calm,

1188
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:08,560
why do you throw napalm?

1189
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:12,680
Last in the lineage of Cleopatra,

1190
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:16,960
with a generous dosing of Hydra.

1191
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:20,880
Knocks my head for my candour,

1192
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:24,560
Her reproaches are obscure.

1193
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:28,120
Even men who play with nuclear,

1194
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:32,120
when in love will go unclear.

1195
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:36,800
Slow down damsel,

1196
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:41,160
My heart's in a dandle,

1197
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:45,320
Girl can we chat up?

1198
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:49,320
Easy now, don't flare up.

1199
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:51,080
Here goes my Glitzy Daisy,

1200
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:52,880
Making my knees go shaky,

1201
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:55,160
Tempting to get clifty,

1202
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:57,280
With you, I'll be crafty.

1203
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,360
Here goes my Glitzy Daisy,
(Glitzy Daisy!)

1204
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:01,320
Making my knees go shaky,
(Knees go shaky!)

1205
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:03,320
Tempting to get clifty,

1206
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:05,320
With you, I'll be crafty.

1207
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,600
Here goes my Glitzy Daisy,

1208
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:09,560
Making my knees go shaky,

1209
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,600
Tempting to get clifty,

1210
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:13,680
With you, I'll be crafty.

1211
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:15,800
Here goes my Glitzy Daisy,

1212
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:17,920
Making my knees go shaky,

1213
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:19,880
Tempting to get clifty,

1214
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:21,760
With you, I'll be crafty.

1215
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:25,920
Here goes my Glitzy Daisy, Making my knees go shaky,

1216
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:29,880
Tempting to get clifty, With you, I'll be crafty.

1217
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:34,080
Here goes my Glitzy Daisy, Making my knees go shaky,

1218
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:38,440
Tempting to get clifty, With you, I'll be crafty.

1219
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:44,520
The mess they got me into.

1220
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,280
God, it’s so painful.

1221
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,080
They are done.

1222
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,240
Hey, what's happening here?

1223
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:57,840
(In Unison) Sir you asked us
never to show our face, Sir.

1224
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:00,640
It’s better to see your face than buttocks.

1225
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:01,600
About turn.

1226
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:03,360
Both would look the same for you.

1227
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:05,880
Like a punctured truck tyre.

1228
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:09,160
Sir, forgot to wash off your soap
while bathing.

1229
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:12,760
- No dude, that’s a baby’s diaper.
- Oh, it threw it on his face.

1230
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:13,880
Don’t divert the topic.

1231
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:17,760
The pictures that we took on Asha’s birthday.

1232
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:20,280
Who asked you to post on FB?

1233
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,640
Sir we confirmed with you.

1234
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:23,200
What?

1235
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:25,360
When you were smooching Asha …
- Hey!

1236
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:29,000
Sorry, scooping cake for Asha,
Mano asked if he can put it on FB.

1237
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,600
You gestured...

1238
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:33,360
Shall I put it on FB?

1239
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:33,840
Sorry?

1240
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:35,640
Shall I put it on FB?

1241
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:37,760
Why are you yelling?
Go ahead.

1242
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:41,320
I thought you asked about depositing in FD.

1243
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:42,480
We meant FB.

1244
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:44,880
- Can’t you say Facebook?
- Can’t you say Fixed Deposit?

1245
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:46,480
Let it slide Sir.

1246
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:48,200
Is there any problem?

1247
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:50,080
Problem?

1248
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:52,080
Hey chubby,

1249
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:54,960
Why are you looking very sexy today?

1250
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:57,320
Already two play,

1251
00:57:58,080 --> 00:57:58,960
you want one more?

1252
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:02,160
I know everything.

1253
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:05,920
What happened at the office?

1254
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:08,160
You know, that girl, Asha.

1255
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,760
She’s very dusky, but very pretty.

1256
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:13,360
Today is her birthday.

1257
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:21,080
So I ordered a heart shaped cake
and we cut it.

1258
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:24,800
She took the arrow,
I took the cake dear.

1259
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:27,280
Was that all?

1260
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:29,560
Nothing more to it?

1261
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:36,160
That fluffy was stubborn
in wanting a selfie with me.

1262
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:39,520
Mano took some 7, 8 photos.

1263
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:42,600
And put it on Fb without my knowledge.

1264
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:44,760
Insubordinate idiot.

1265
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:46,320
Was that all?

1266
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:48,840
Nothing more to it?
- I’m not eating this, am I?

1267
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,160
Nothing else dear

1268
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,040
That's all there is to it?

1269
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:54,560
Is there anything you'd like to add?

1270
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:56,200
Get ready Kuthalam.

1271
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:57,320
Tell me, dear.

1272
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:04,520
Asha is quite jovial,
always smiling.

1273
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:09,320
I gave her a gift of 50 Thousand in FD.

1274
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:10,360
Fifty Thousand?

1275
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:12,360
That was all that was there
in the account dear.

1276
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:14,480
I thought you knew everything.

1277
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:16,480
So I spilled it now?

1278
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:19,160
Can I at least eat before…?

1279
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:20,720
Ready dear.

1280
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:22,240
Your time starts now.

1281
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:25,720
Long time desire, darling.

1282
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:27,560
Yes.
Come on.

1283
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:28,360
Why dude?

1284
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:31,640
- Why are you behaving like a high school kid?
- Aren't you behaving like an elementary school kid?

1285
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:32,760
No answers right?

1286
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:33,680
Can’t say?

1287
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:34,800
You won’t let me say.

1288
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:36,040
Goodness me!

1289
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:39,600
The bank is asking back the loan?

1290
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:41,080
Kungumam show Sowmiya...

1291
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:44,600
Hello Sowmiya!
Hello Mano.

1292
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:46,720
I was just in a meeting
trying to get you a job.

1293
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:47,680
Job?

1294
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:50,480
It’ll be ready in one, one and a half week.
Ok?

1295
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:52,160
Mano, it's alright.

1296
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:54,440
I’ve landed a bigger show.

1297
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:55,840
With a better salary.

1298
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:57,520
I wanted to tell you this.

1299
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:58,960
It’s all because of you Mano.

1300
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:01,080
It’s alright.
- Take the last right.

1301
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:04,080
So why don’t you call your ex-boss Keerthana,
and laugh at her?

1302
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:04,840
Laugh at her?

1303
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:07,560
No, no… I meant her in person and apologized.

1304
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:08,880
We had a good laugh about it.

1305
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:11,560
She's past it.
Wished me all the best.

1306
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:14,160
Why don’t you apologize to Keerthana madam?

1307
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:16,000
Why the unnecessary fuss?

1308
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:17,760
It’s for your good Mano...
- Sowmiya madam...

1309
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:20,520
Your route is clear now,
have a good ride.

1310
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:22,880
Don't start advising like Oprah

1311
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:24,600
Or I’ll pay you a visit to your shooting spot.

1312
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:26,320
I didn’t mean it that way, Sorry.

1313
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:27,320
What was that?

1314
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:29,600
Keerthana was the troublemaker.
She wouldn’t say sorry.

1315
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:31,160
But I have to ask her sorry?

1316
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:32,880
Even I think the same.

1317
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:35,080
- Think what?
- Say sorry to her.

1318
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:36,680
Why are you all scared?

1319
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:37,640
What can she do?

1320
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:38,800
What can she do?
- Mano!

1321
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:41,160
Hey Mano!

1322
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:43,480
What’s wrong mom?

1323
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:45,560
What’s wrong with Keerthana?

1324
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:48,160
You apologized on stage right?

1325
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:50,080
Do you tell your mom everything?

1326
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:51,520
Is that important now?
Go on, mom.

1327
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:56,960
She has sued us for One Million Rupees.

1328
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:03,640
Why don’t you borrow a million
from your manager Kuthalam Sir?

1329
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:06,440
Mom, he won’t lend 10 rupees for a tea.

1330
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:08,440
You want a million from him.

1331
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,240
Mother, who’s your Maths teacher?

1332
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:12,760
Why?

1333
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:13,800
I wanna know.

1334
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:15,400
Teacher Kumarasamy.

1335
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:17,560
I guessed so.

1336
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:19,680
Is this One million?
It's Ten Million.

1337
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:22,840
(In Unison) Ten Million?
- Yep, Ten Million.

1338
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:26,640
If you react in unison,
will the problem vanish?

1339
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,880
Will we get Ten Million, if we sell our house?

1340
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:35,000
Our house owner would know better.

1341
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:36,320
Oh...
- Om Muruga.

1342
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:38,600
Wish Thanos was real.

1343
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:41,800
- What are you mumbling?
- Why are you rambling?

1344
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:44,520
Do you want this solved or not?

1345
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:45,760
Of course.

1346
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:48,640
Promise your mom
that you won't mess with Keerthana.

1347
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:50,320
Swear it.

1348
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:52,440
Swear on me.

1349
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:55,160
Stop.

1350
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:56,680
Show me the other hand.

1351
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:00,480
Knew it.

1352
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:02,440
Promises with fingers crossed don’t count?

1353
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:05,560
Stop being childish.
Swear on her.

1354
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:08,440
Mom!

1355
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:10,440
He has sworn.

1356
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:11,800
Who’s the advocate?

1357
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:13,160
Mr Arjun Reddy.

1358
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:15,160
Name is majestic.

1359
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:17,280
He looks that way too.

1360
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:30,280
Hi.

1361
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:31,680
(In Unison) Whatever it takes.

1362
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:33,560
Nice to see you bro.
- (Pay for tea)

1363
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:34,560
He'll pay, wait.

1364
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:35,840
You have come in an ambulance.

1365
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:37,680
Reddy…
- Sri Reddy?

1366
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:39,600
My cousin Prakash Reddy.

1367
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:42,680
Was consulting for him.
Got delayed.

1368
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:45,160
Vehicle got punctured. Asked him for help.

1369
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:46,760
Said ‘cease ambulance’.

1370
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:48,080
Seize it?

1371
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:51,000
He said take my ambulance in Telugu.

1372
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:53,160
- Oh ok.
- So took a ride with it.

1373
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:54,160
He is…

1374
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:55,560
Oh is he the convict?

1375
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:57,480
Not yet, just an accused.

1376
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:59,400
My friend Mano.
- Hi, Hello

1377
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:00,560
Don’t worry.

1378
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:03,080
We are winning this case.
Arrange for a success party.

1379
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:04,920
I’ll go see Padhu.

1380
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:07,320
Hearing is up next, he wants to go see Padhu?

1381
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:07,920
Who is she?

1382
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:10,040
Judge Padhmanabhan is what he meant.

1383
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:12,680
He calls judge by a nickname?

1384
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:14,920
This is just the beginning.

1385
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:18,160
Lots to follow.

1386
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:20,600
Keerthana.

1387
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:23,640
You are summoned, come.

1388
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:25,160
Laughing all the time.

1389
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:29,880
"The truth is defined by it's..."
(Classical Tamil Poetry)

1390
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:32,360
Err... you know the rest, Your Honour.

1391
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:34,480
This is my client, Manohar.

1392
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:36,080
Vanakkam Sir.
- Objection your Honour.

1393
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:38,320
He hasn’t even begun yet.
What is your objection?

1394
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:41,160
He should not advocate.
He doesn't have the rights.

1395
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:42,600
What is this nonsense your Honour?

1396
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:44,240
Who says I don’t have the right to talk?

1397
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:46,000
I did. Are you deaf?
- What?

1398
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:49,720
How dare you?
- Order, order.... Silence!

1399
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:51,040
Your Honour,

1400
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:54,320
I’m submitting important documents
regarding this conversation.

1401
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:54,920
Madam...

1402
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:00,600
Mr Arjun Reddy.

1403
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:01,520
Yea it’s me.

1404
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:02,920
What is this nonsense?

1405
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:05,240
You have 12 backlogs in Law College.

1406
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:07,960
You haven’t graduated yet.
- Backlogs?

1407
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:08,760
Your Honour,

1408
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:12,320
is this how you question a sincere lawyer?
- What's going on?

1409
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:13,800
“ Are you qualified?” you ask me.

1410
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:17,160
Have you have practiced with
counterfeit certificates all these years?

1411
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:19,240
Cheating.
Fraud.

1412
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:20,440
Your Honour...
- Your Honour...

1413
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:23,080
Is he not an advocate?
- No.

1414
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:27,360
Sir just give me two minutes.
I’ll kill him and surrender in this same podium.

1415
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:30,480
Sir, just give me a minute.
I’ll kill him and surrender in that podium.

1416
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:31,880
Your honour…

1417
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:36,040
Hello Inspector, take him into enquiry.

1418
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:41,920
Mr Manohar, stretch this case for 6 months.

1419
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:45,040
I’ll cheat my exams and graduate.

1420
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:47,200
Then I’ll take over, don’t worry.

1421
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:51,440
Excuse me. Can I have an advance payment
of 5000 rupees?

1422
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,600
Halfwit, couldn't even graduate.

1423
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:56,760
Ask him to get out first.
- Get lost.

1424
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,200
Bad manners.
Can we go shopping like in Bangalore?

1425
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:00,560
Fraud
Cheat.

1426
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:04,040
I wouldn't have shared Wi-Fi had I known this.

1427
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:09,360
If you look pissed when I should be,
I'd calm down.

1428
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:11,000
That’s your logic.

1429
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:12,720
No darling.
Scold me, come on.

1430
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:15,200
I will never scold you.
- Thanks

1431
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:18,760
Taking your dumb advice…
I should scold myself.

1432
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:21,400
Look at her.

1433
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:23,600
She’s enjoying our tomfoolery.

1434
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:27,320
If I lose this case…
- I’m finished.

1435
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:28,880
Give me your hand.

1436
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:31,200
Darling, you won’t lose.

1437
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:33,160
You’ll definitely win.
I’ll make sure of it darling.

1438
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:33,760
Young man...

1439
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,240
Yes darling.
- Sorry?

1440
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:35,960
Sir...

1441
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:37,600
Would you like an extension?

1442
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:39,240
Finish it in the next hearing?

1443
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:43,920
I'm a fan of John Grisham...
know a few things about law.

1444
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:46,040
So can I please advocate on my behalf?

1445
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:49,480
Sir, he doesn’t hold a degree.
How can he advocate?

1446
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:50,360
He can.

1447
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:52,360
There are provisions in the law.

1448
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:55,640
Sit back and enjoy madam.

1449
01:05:59,040 --> 01:05:59,640
Proceed.

1450
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:00,880
Your Honour,

1451
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:02,920
can you please summon Keerthana Vasudevan?

1452
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:04,640
I have a demonstration for you.

1453
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:07,960
If it is just a demo, use someone else.

1454
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:09,680
Somebody else...

1455
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:11,200
Not her.

1456
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:13,880
Excuse me, your Honour.

1457
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:14,680
Carry on.

1458
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:17,880
Darling.
Perform like Keerthana in this demo.

1459
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:19,280
I can’t perform like a woman.

1460
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:20,560
Are you a friend?

1461
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:22,080
Had it been Auto Sekar here...

1462
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:23,760
He would play act?
- Definitely.

1463
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:25,840
But we can’t bear to watch it.

1464
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,240
It would suit you darling.

1465
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:29,520
You are a brilliant actor.

1466
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:30,920
Flattered.

1467
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:35,560
I’ll call out,
“Keerthana Vasudevan can you please come”?

1468
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:38,480
Perform well.
- Better than Mrs Doubtfire.

1469
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:40,600
I’m starting the demo Sir.

1470
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:41,240
Proceed.

1471
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:42,520
Keerthana Vasudevan.

1472
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:56,520
Damn.

1473
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:58,640
Killing it.

1474
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:00,280
Stop ogling.

1475
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:02,040
Dude, hit me.

1476
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:03,800
I’m so embarrassed.

1477
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:06,160
I didn’t ask you to hit on me.
Hit me.

1478
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:08,560
Did you see that you Hon…

1479
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:13,320
We were hasty.

1480
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:15,320
An action replay for you, your Honour.

1481
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:22,440
Duuuuude, hiiiittt meee.
- Yyyyyou loooussy rrrogueee.

1482
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:24,760
Statue.

1483
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:26,440
Now your Honour,

1484
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:28,280
This is Keerthana Vasudevan.

1485
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:29,360
This is her hand.

1486
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:31,040
When she raised her hand,

1487
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:33,320
To protect me,

1488
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:35,960
In self-defense,
I laid my hand on her.

1489
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:39,080
This is what I meant about laying a hand.

1490
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:41,920
"A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush"
they say.

1491
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:43,240
Who's the birdie?

1492
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:44,480
Did you see that?

1493
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:48,280
Half our folks twist simple words
into filthy ones.

1494
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:52,360
Likewise, when I apologized for laying a hand,

1495
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:57,080
They said I laid a hand and sued me
your Honour.

1496
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:58,880
Exactly, your Honour...

1497
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:02,000
he was direct and insulting.

1498
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:03,840
Please watch the video again, Sir.

1499
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:05,840
I have watched it many times.

1500
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:07,160
Go on.

1501
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:07,960
Sir...

1502
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:11,840
Jallikattu, Methane, Ethane,
Neutrino, Hydrocarbon, Gasoline prices,

1503
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,640
Farmers’ distress, Cauvery Management, NEET,

1504
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:16,360
Sterlite, 8 way road etc are all protests in TamilNadu.

1505
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:18,480
All these cases are in pending.

1506
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:21,320
In this scenario,
they have cooked up a case and,

1507
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:24,360
have wasted the court's time, your time and my time.

1508
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:28,480
Putting all of us under undue stress
is this Keerthana Vasudevan and co.

1509
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:34,720
After all this, if their stature wins in the end,

1510
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:37,040
then I would be pressed to file a case, Sir.

1511
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:39,480
On what grounds?

1512
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:42,320
Sir, she filed a defamation case on me,

1513
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:46,080
Likewise I would file for not knowing
what constitutes defamation.

1514
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:50,720
How can you do that?

1515
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:52,360
Have some sense!

1516
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:57,640
When others sue saying,
they don't know “scheme”, can I not repeat it, Sir?

1517
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:03,720
Does it bleed blood for them and ketchup for us?

1518
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:07,240
Mrs Nirmala Sethuraman,
any further arguments?

1519
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:10,840
Sir if you dismiss this case,
we would contest in Supreme Court.

1520
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:11,680
Is it?

1521
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:15,680
The case is dismissed.
Try your luck in Supreme Court.

1522
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:17,680
The court is adjourned.

1523
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:42,520
Madam definitely we can take...

1524
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:47,840
Dude...

1525
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:54,840
I saw your video on Whatsapp. Too good.

1526
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:57,600
What video?
- Your Tik Tok video.

1527
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:00,000
Oh that one.
Come here.

1528
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:01,600
Keerthana!

1529
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:06,920
You might enjoy losing to me,
But winning you is so boring for me.

1530
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:10,240
I won’t watch even game that’s boring.

1531
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:11,640
How will I play then?

1532
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:14,440
I like my games to be interesting always.

1533
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:16,440
Try better.

1534
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:21,080
Keerthana...

1535
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:25,160
You don’t fail when you fall.
You fail when you don’t get back up.

1536
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:50,520
(Singing)

1537
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:52,320
(Singing out of chorus)

1538
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:55,480
Baby, she's not in sync like our minister.

1539
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:56,640
Which minister baby?

1540
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:58,160
I would get in trouble.

1541
01:10:58,360 --> 01:10:59,760
Quite cautious baby.

1542
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:00,760
Baby...

1543
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:03,600
are you wearing a canopy?

1544
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:04,920
Embarrassing me, baby.

1545
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:06,200
My granny's.

1546
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:08,440
It was loose on her.
So I flicked it.

1547
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:10,440
Baby are you speaking like an educated?

1548
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:12,440
I’m a second grader dude.
- Yea right.

1549
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:15,800
Who’s that driving with high beam?

1550
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:18,080
Who are you?

1551
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:20,960
Baby, why is she here?

1552
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:22,200
Maybe wants some crackers.

1553
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:24,440
Show some swagger to her.

1554
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:25,360
Yep.

1555
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:30,440
I meant my swagger.
- As usual, go on.

1556
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:37,600
Look at him,
his head is all glossy under lights.

1557
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:40,760
Vanakkam Vanakkam Vana…
- Same to you uncle.

1558
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:43,880
Globy, that’s his style.
He won’t let you finish.

1559
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:48,360
On this auspicious time and day,
Madam has come to visit your home.

1560
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:49,560
Oh.
- Madam...

1561
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:53,560
why take the trouble?
We could have visited you.

1562
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:56,240
Will you not invi…
- Come in please.

1563
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:57,360
Welcome.

1564
01:11:58,400 --> 01:11:58,760
Mom.

1565
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:00,240
Welcome.

1566
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:03,240
Have some sweets, madam.

1567
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:04,840
You wouldn’t have tasted this ever.

1568
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:09,440
Would have only seen them in showcases.
Gorge on it later.

1569
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:10,640
Please sit down Madam.

1570
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:12,880
Welcome.

1571
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:19,160
Don’t be too respectful kid.

1572
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:20,640
Have a seat.

1573
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:32,720
What’s with you?
- Style!

1574
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:33,760
Uncross your legs.

1575
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:36,000
What's the purpose of your visit?

1576
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,680
We have just come in, relax.

1577
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:41,560
Who is that?

1578
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:42,680
Is he your husband?

1579
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:44,960
Yes.

1580
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:47,160
He was working in transport.

1581
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:49,040
Died in an accident.

1582
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:50,640
Oh I’m so sorry.

1583
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:52,760
Are you employed?

1584
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:53,560
No.

1585
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:56,560
I was a tailor in an export company.

1586
01:12:57,160 --> 01:12:59,040
Quit after chronic pain in the legs.

1587
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:01,080
Oh… tch tch.

1588
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:03,360
So sad.
- This conversation is unnecessary madam.

1589
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:05,080
What do you want here?

1590
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:08,240
Tell us.

1591
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:09,360
Pick up that call.

1592
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:11,360
That’s my phone, my call.

1593
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:12,640
To pick up is my discretion.

1594
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:14,640
What’s your agenda here?

1595
01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:18,000
You’ll know it when you pick up that call.

1596
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:22,400
Sir...

1597
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:23,920
Mano. A good news.

1598
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:27,160
Our showroom has been taken over
by a new company.

1599
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:28,280
Super Sir.

1600
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:30,280
Also, a bad news for you.

1601
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:32,080
You were fired.

1602
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:35,080
Sir...

1603
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:38,560
What is the reason?
- They said they’ll tell you in person.

1604
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:40,520
Don’t worry, I’ll back you.

1605
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:41,200
Bye.

1606
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:44,160
Said something about a meeting?

1607
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:45,760
It’s already underway.

1608
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:49,600
That new company is KV Enterprises.

1609
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:51,520
Keerthana Vasudevan Enterprises.

1610
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:54,560
That's the company,
that took over your showroom,

1611
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:58,160
and fired you.

1612
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:00,680
Now you must be knowing
who the new boss is.

1613
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:02,400
I fired you.

1614
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:06,160
You want to know the reason?
I'll tell you.

1615
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:07,960
Number one,

1616
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:09,760
I didn't like your name.

1617
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:12,720
Manohar… yuck.

1618
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:14,440
Number two,

1619
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:17,160
I hate your attitude.

1620
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:19,280
Number three,

1621
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:22,720
I absolutely despise guys like you
from the hood.

1622
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:23,600
That’s why.

1623
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:28,440
Aren't you middle class?

1624
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:30,880
Family is dependent on monthly salary.

1625
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:32,880
Keerthu madam, let me remind you.

1626
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:37,240
If they miss their monthly salary,
the hardships they face in the first week...

1627
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:38,600
God have mercy on them.

1628
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:40,800
I'm tearing up already

1629
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:42,360
How are you gonna live?

1630
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:45,160
Uncle, they are shocked.

1631
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:47,160
Don’t pile on.
Please don’t do that.

1632
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:48,680
Sorry Mam, I became emotional.

1633
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:49,640
Sorry.
- Get a hold.

1634
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:50,560
Ok

1635
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:54,680
I feel sorry for you and your family.

1636
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:58,320
I think I should help out.

1637
01:14:58,880 --> 01:14:59,800
Let me think.

1638
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:00,600
Keerthu madam...

1639
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:02,240
you are their saviour.

1640
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:06,840
If you desert them,
they might come to wrong conclusions.

1641
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,760
Ok uncle, I’ll listen to you.

1642
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:13,080
Mano...

1643
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:15,080
you can be my driver.

1644
01:15:15,680 --> 01:15:18,280
Also, you can be my cook.

1645
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:23,160
And you dusting….
I mean housekeeping.

1646
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:25,040
Uncle, let’s go.

1647
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:29,000
When I’m in Middle class homes,
I feel suffocated.

1648
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:30,080
I don’t like how they smell.

1649
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:32,880
I think this is your longest stay in one.

1650
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:34,160
It’s a record!

1651
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:39,160
The kindness you shower on this family,
Keerthu Madam I’m so proud.

1652
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:41,080
What nonsense is this?

1653
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:44,600
Had you been more respectful,
would you be here?

1654
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:46,840
For all the insults you threw at me.

1655
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:50,760
Baldies are Rocky Balbaos.

1656
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:53,800
What just happened?

1657
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:55,640
They are threatening us
in our homes.

1658
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:56,760
Did you see that?

1659
01:15:57,240 --> 01:15:58,960
Close the colony gates.

1660
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:00,440
Let’s have an intervention.

1661
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:02,520
That’s our everyday life mom.

1662
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:05,360
Do I look like a janitor?

1663
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:07,360
Go to the cops, take them to court.

1664
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:09,640
I’ve just returned from that cycle.

1665
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:11,160
Incorrigible
- Baby!

1666
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:12,040
What baby?

1667
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:14,040
She’s waiting for you outside.

1668
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:17,800
Mr Mano,

1669
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:22,400
I forgot to tell you the real reason
for firing you.

1670
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,400
I’ll tell you now, listen.

1671
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:29,880
Should make you realize my stature, clout.
Shouldn't I?

1672
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:31,520
Ergo.

1673
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:33,400
Is the game interesting now?

1674
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:55,960
Baby, is she a woman?

1675
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:57,720
She behaves like a ghoul.

1676
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:00,800
Playing in our own turf.

1677
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:03,240
Fired you, on top of it.

1678
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:05,240
I'm so pissed...

1679
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:09,080
Shall we troll her on social media?

1680
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:10,360
No?

1681
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:14,160
Let’s break her office down.

1682
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:15,920
No?

1683
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:18,640
How about battery?
We have guys ready.

1684
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:20,480
No?
- Baby….

1685
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:22,240
Okay...

1686
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:24,160
Let’s kill her and go to jail.

1687
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:26,360
No, my granny will be alone.

1688
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:28,600
What do we do now? Say it.

1689
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:31,280
Keerthana Vasudevan will regret,

1690
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:37,720
meeting, speaking, and messing with Mano,
her entire lifetime.

1691
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:39,560
I’ll make sure of it.

1692
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:40,760
What happened next?

1693
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:43,480
What are you gonna do?

1694
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:45,160
What happened next?

1695
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:47,720
Say it, don't make cry.

1696
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:49,160
What happened next?

1697
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:53,160
"Punish an evil-doer by shaming
him with a good deed" (Thirukural)

1698
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:54,600
Said Thiruvalluvar.

1699
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:58,600
"Punish an evil-doer by shaming
them instantly and relentlessly"

1700
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:00,040
Says Manohar.

1701
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:01,640
Keerthana!

1702
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:11,760
You finished this?

1703
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:14,200
Pee Pee?
Wee Wee?

1704
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:15,320
And everything?

1705
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:16,800
You drank your tea?

1706
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:17,960
Nah... waste.

1707
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:19,640
Now please tell me.

1708
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:21,520
What happened next?

1709
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:25,760
"A maiden who is short on temper,
ages quicker."

1710
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:26,880
What is this?

1711
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:29,360
I have to write subtitles now.

1712
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:33,320
The girl who gets more angry
becomes grandmother so soon.

1713
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:34,760
Who said this?
- Me

1714
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:35,800
When?
- Now.

1715
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:37,280
Wow!

1716
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:41,960
Forget the petty fights,
I decided to make her older,

1717
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:43,840
by making her angrier by loving her.

1718
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:46,080
To achieve that, I used her own route.

1719
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:48,720
I took the driver’s job.

1720
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:49,920
What?! Driver?

1721
01:18:50,280 --> 01:18:53,840
Is there a better opportunity
to see her everyday?

1722
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:07,360
What a situational song!
Very romantic!

1723
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:10,760
Excuse me.
Keep the phone in silent mode.

1724
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:12,280
No calls during driving.

1725
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:15,280
Madam, first day at a new job.

1726
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:16,920
So my family wants to wish me.

1727
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:18,920
Just this call please.

1728
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:22,080
Sister.!
- Where are you?

1729
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:23,760
Your brother is busy.

1730
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:27,760
Call me later?
Shoot, she insulted us in our homes.

1731
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:30,160
You took her job offer? Shameless.

1732
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:31,760
Smite her face.

1733
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:35,080
Sorry. She’s just a teenager.
Has no idea what she just said.

1734
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:37,160
This should be the first and last time.

1735
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:39,080
No phones during driving.

1736
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:41,960
Auto Sekar!

1737
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:43,720
Didn’t I just tell you?

1738
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:45,080
But he won’t know it right?

1739
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:46,480
He’s my close friend.

1740
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:48,520
If I don’t pick it up now,
I’ll hear about this all year.

1741
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:49,720
Don't pick it up now.

1742
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:51,760
Please, please.
Just this one.

1743
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:53,480
Yes, baby.
- Baby,

1744
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:55,320
Keerthana, who visited you...
- Yes,

1745
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:59,200
Don't be deceived by her looks.
She's uncouth.

1746
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:02,200
She can never be our family.
Don't make friends with her.

1747
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:04,720
Not a teenager.

1748
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:06,520
Is fully aware of what he said.

1749
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:07,560
Stop the car.

1750
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:08,840
Why?

1751
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:10,200
Stop the car.

1752
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:12,960
I will stop only at the office.
- Will you stop the car now or not?

1753
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:14,240
Ok ok.

1754
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:18,520
Have no idea how to park this.

1755
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:21,560
What?

1756
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:22,520
Will you step out?

1757
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:28,040
Give me the keys.

1758
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:31,880
Oh no, if you take the wheel
while I'm riding shotgun,

1759
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:34,800
People might think we are a couple.

1760
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:35,480
Hey...

1761
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:37,200
You have been fired.

1762
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:37,960
Now, keys.

1763
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:39,080
Can’t return them.

1764
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:39,840
What the …

1765
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:41,160
It’s in the car.

1766
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:42,880
Please take it.

1767
01:20:43,160 --> 01:20:43,880
Just kidding.

1768
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:45,320
Catch it!

1769
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:46,760
You...

1770
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:48,320
Keerthu dear,

1771
01:20:50,120 --> 01:20:52,960
like a Test match on a rainy day,
my life was sluggish.

1772
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:54,720
But after you showed up,

1773
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:59,240
it is now a T20 match on a sunny day
with Gayle on fire!

1774
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:00,800
So?

1775
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:01,880
So,

1776
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:03,960
I've decided to propose you.

1777
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:05,720
Propose?

1778
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:07,640
You want to know the reason?
I will tell you.

1779
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:08,760
Number One,

1780
01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:12,360
I like your name.
Keerthana Vasudevan.

1781
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:13,520
Wow!

1782
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:15,040
What a trendy name!

1783
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:16,440
Number Two,

1784
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:19,520
Your attitude, latitude,
longitude, magnitude,

1785
01:21:19,720 --> 01:21:21,640
...altitude. I love them all.

1786
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:22,640
Number Three,

1787
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:25,960
I just love classy women like you.

1788
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:29,040
Now I am going to tell you the magic words.

1789
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:30,120
Keerthu dear...

1790
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:32,960
8 letters, 3 words, One meaning.

1791
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:36,360
8 letters, One meaning, 3 words.

1792
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:39,360
3 words, 8 letters, One meaning.

1793
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:41,600
And that is...

1794
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:43,640
I love...

1795
01:21:47,240 --> 01:21:48,320
Trying to escape?

1796
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:50,040
This ain’t over.

1797
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:52,360
You aren't naive anyways.

1798
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:53,760
Here I come.

1799
01:21:58,480 --> 01:21:59,480
Hello, Dora!

1800
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:01,880
Dora? Who is this?

1801
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:03,560
Oh are we playing pretend?

1802
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:05,080
Don’t you know my voice?

1803
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:10,040
So Dora can't bear to look into my eyes?

1804
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:12,120
Running off, blushed.

1805
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:13,160
It’s okay.

1806
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:14,280
This is my number.

1807
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:15,960
Mark it as Mr Local.

1808
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:16,880
Sorry?

1809
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:21,040
When you are in the mood, call me,
like me, subscribe to me.

1810
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:23,960
Keerthu, this season is ours.

1811
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:25,360
Ciao!

1812
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:33,120
All the best, dear.

1813
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:35,120
You said this one too many.

1814
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:37,840
Buy me tab, when you land this job.

1815
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:41,240
There are new shows on SunNxt….

1816
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:42,760
Mom, I’ll call you back.

1817
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:44,040
Don’t forget the tab.

1818
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:44,960
Bye mom.

1819
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:47,080
Hey Jasha Ashmin.

1820
01:22:47,240 --> 01:22:47,920
Hey, Mano!

1821
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:48,960
Darn, Asha Jasmin.

1822
01:22:49,160 --> 01:22:50,080
What a surprise!

1823
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:51,160
How did you end up here?

1824
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:52,760
Life has to move on.

1825
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:53,960
Why are you here?

1826
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:56,480
Here to see HR Manager Balaji,
interview.

1827
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:58,640
Okay. Go straight, first cabin.

1828
01:22:58,840 --> 01:22:59,920
All the best Mano.

1829
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:01,560
Asha...

1830
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:04,240
Kuthalam Sir and Raja never return my calls.

1831
01:23:04,360 --> 01:23:05,360
Are you in touch…?

1832
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:06,480
Don’t talk about them.

1833
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:08,400
I don’t want to speak to them ever.

1834
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:11,120
Kuthalam… what a cheapo.

1835
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:12,960
Did he misbehave with you?

1836
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:15,960
I knew it. Fatty’s chronicles.

1837
01:23:16,520 --> 01:23:17,200
What did he do?

1838
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:20,360
He deposited 50 thousand on my birthday,
remember?

1839
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:20,880
Yea.

1840
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:22,880
He wants that back.

1841
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:24,440
How cold?

1842
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:26,560
Bloody heartless fellow.

1843
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:28,480
It disturbed me a lot.

1844
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:29,360
Oh my.

1845
01:23:29,720 --> 01:23:32,320
I've tried reaching you,
but you never pick up.

1846
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:34,880
We'll continue this after the interview.
- Will you be online at nights?

1847
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:36,480
No, I’m leaving town.
- Escaped.

1848
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:41,480
HR Department….

1849
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:43,120
So rude.

1850
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:45,840
You, Oooo….Om Shakthi.

1851
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:46,920
How did you end up here?

1852
01:23:47,240 --> 01:23:48,120
So who’s the new deity?

1853
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:50,600
Fashion, bro.

1854
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:51,520
Stop kidding.

1855
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:52,880
Is it for Melmaruvathur?

1856
01:23:53,080 --> 01:23:56,640
Obvious you dumb m…. Om Shakthi.

1857
01:23:56,960 --> 01:23:59,720
I was fired, so I’m here for my interview.

1858
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:00,720
Why did you quit?

1859
01:24:00,920 --> 01:24:03,560
F… Om Shakthi Om Shakthi.

1860
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:07,240
I didn’t quit, I was fired.

1861
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:09,600
Mr P Raja.

1862
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:10,600
Aye aye Mam.

1863
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:12,200
Is Mano, your close friend?

1864
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:14,520
Not just a regular friend.

1865
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:16,960
He means more to me.

1866
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:18,200
You’re terminated.

1867
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:19,360
I’m terminator?

1868
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:20,200
Get out.

1869
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:22,080
Om Shakthi.

1870
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:25,840
I’ll never forget this sacrifice.

1871
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:27,400
In another life….

1872
01:24:27,640 --> 01:24:29,960
Destiny should make me a hero
and you my friend.

1873
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:31,760
You’ll realise my pains then.

1874
01:24:33,560 --> 01:24:35,360
I was in your boots once.

1875
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:37,360
You chose not to move out of your
comfort zone.

1876
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:40,080
I kept climbing… this interview.

1877
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:42,040
Looking for HR.

1878
01:24:42,280 --> 01:24:43,800
Excuse me Sir, HR manager room….

1879
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:48,720
Him again?

1880
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:51,640
Raja was my friend, he was thrown out.
Okay.

1881
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:53,640
You weren't even my friend, Sir.

1882
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:56,080
Why did you lose your job?

1883
01:24:57,320 --> 01:25:00,120
Why you are dismissed my boy
Mr Manohar in this company?

1884
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:01,200
Come on tell me.

1885
01:25:01,320 --> 01:25:02,760
I won’t give you a single reason.

1886
01:25:03,160 --> 01:25:03,800
You know why?

1887
01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:05,560
Because I’m terminating you also.

1888
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:06,560
Me?

1889
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:07,600
What the hell?

1890
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:08,560
Get out you clown.

1891
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:12,200
Oh my God.

1892
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:16,120
First you go finish the interview.

1893
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:17,240
Another we will talk.

1894
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:18,360
Dot.

1895
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:20,240
Bloody crap.

1896
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:21,560
Bloody fools.

1897
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:24,120
Alright forget lunch, let’s go breakfast.

1898
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:26,480
Sir, did Asha return your money….
- Get lost immediately.

1899
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:27,840
I can't see anybody.

1900
01:25:30,120 --> 01:25:32,360
I’m requesting you, dinner or lunch?

1901
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:34,040
Sir flirting in the office.
- Get in quick.

1902
01:25:34,280 --> 01:25:35,840
Oh no.
-  Shut him out.

1903
01:25:38,240 --> 01:25:43,480
No matter how far we get away,
he always seeks us out.

1904
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:46,560
Even if you spell out your thoughts,
he ain't moving anywhere.

1905
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:49,160
"Money given in charity..."

1906
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:50,520
Are you alright?

1907
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:52,400
I’m gonna say it anyways.

1908
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:54,200
"...won't make parity"

1909
01:25:54,520 --> 01:25:56,720
Why did you ask Asha
to return the money, Sir?

1910
01:25:56,920 --> 01:26:01,160
I’m out of the relationship
but my wife's having none of it.

1911
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:03,920
That’s why I want my money back.
- Sir...

1912
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:05,920
She might hear you.

1913
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:07,880
Is Asha here?
- There...

1914
01:26:08,120 --> 01:26:09,480
chatting with token No 7.

1915
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:11,880
Let’s ask her.

1916
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:13,400
Hey calm down.

1917
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:14,600
Now she's a big deal.

1918
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:15,600
Shut it.

1919
01:26:17,080 --> 01:26:19,200
Selfies should be outlawed.

1920
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:21,200
They are together?

1921
01:26:21,640 --> 01:26:22,800
She broke-up?
- Yep

1922
01:26:23,160 --> 01:26:24,480
Hence flirting with the janitor?

1923
01:26:24,720 --> 01:26:25,480
Keep quiet.

1924
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:28,800
He doesn’t know… please.

1925
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:30,880
Shall we do?

1926
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:32,120
Yes let's do.

1927
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:33,960
Sir he’s in penance.

1928
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:36,240
Hey we meant putting down papers.

1929
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:38,480
Why? You have a desk job here.

1930
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:40,440
Why do you want to be a paper boy?

1931
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:42,960
We are going to give the ‘resi-Ganesan’ letter.

1932
01:26:43,160 --> 01:26:46,080
Why should we give Susi Ganesan, the letter?
- I meant recognition letter.

1933
01:26:46,240 --> 01:26:47,760
You meant resignation letter.

1934
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:48,280
Why?

1935
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:49,920
Because of you.

1936
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:50,960
What did I do?

1937
01:26:51,560 --> 01:26:52,480
You are here.

1938
01:26:52,720 --> 01:26:54,960
She’s gonna sniff you out,
and buy this company.

1939
01:26:55,120 --> 01:26:57,360
And chuck us out of here.

1940
01:26:57,480 --> 01:26:59,160
It’s better if we leave first.

1941
01:26:59,360 --> 01:27:00,440
Funny boys.

1942
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:02,880
I swear on the Samosas here,

1943
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:05,240
we have sorted our issues.

1944
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:07,760
Finished.
- Super darling!

1945
01:27:08,240 --> 01:27:11,800
But now, I've decided to mess with her
by trying to woo her.

1946
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:12,960
- Finished.
- Termination confirmed.

1947
01:27:13,160 --> 01:27:15,520
Why don’t I start rearing cattle?

1948
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:17,560
She’ll figure that out.

1949
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:19,480
Let’s go join Swacch Bharath in North India?

1950
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:20,880
What's that?
- Dissenter.

1951
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:22,040
Guys, guys... chill.

1952
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:24,800
It's just harmless one sided love.

1953
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:25,960
Front side or back side?
- Language!

1954
01:27:26,120 --> 01:27:27,240
Om Shakthi Om Shakthi.

1955
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:29,240
Is there any chance she would fall in love?

1956
01:27:29,640 --> 01:27:31,240
There is no chance
she even phones him.

1957
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:32,640
Romance is far off.
- Good one!

1958
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:33,640
I know.

1959
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:36,400
What's Dork?

1960
01:27:36,640 --> 01:27:37,480
Dora, Sir.

1961
01:27:37,720 --> 01:27:38,480
Who’s Dora?

1962
01:27:39,480 --> 01:27:40,240
My Keerthu.

1963
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:42,360
My nick name for her is...

1964
01:27:43,320 --> 01:27:43,880
Dora!

1965
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:44,840
- What?
- Darn it.

1966
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:46,840
Too much noise here.

1967
01:27:47,080 --> 01:27:48,600
Hold on, I'll move.
- Ok

1968
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:49,960
Did he just say we are noisy?

1969
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:52,240
Both of us.
Had it been one, he would have been direct.

1970
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:53,720
Watch it.
Sorry Sir.

1971
01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:55,800
I thought of calling you.

1972
01:27:55,920 --> 01:27:57,920
I just landed a job.

1973
01:27:58,200 --> 01:27:59,960
With a better pay.

1974
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:01,320
Thanks to you.

1975
01:28:01,480 --> 01:28:03,880
- (Singing)
- Mano, Manohar. What are you doing?

1976
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:05,920
Ok I’ll stop.

1977
01:28:06,160 --> 01:28:08,200
Manohar, are you free today?

1978
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:12,440
I'm busy for others.
My schedule is always open for you, Keerthu.

1979
01:28:13,160 --> 01:28:16,280
Ok then. Can we meet at Park Hotel,
Rooftop restaurant in the evening?

1980
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:17,640
Nice!

1981
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:20,120
Moving our romance to the next step.

1982
01:28:20,280 --> 01:28:21,920
Good improvement, good improvement.

1983
01:28:22,120 --> 01:28:23,560
When will you be there?

1984
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:25,240
7 'o' clock sharp.

1985
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:26,960
But I’ll be late… be around 8.30.

1986
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:28,400
Wait for me, ok?

1987
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:29,880
Ok.

1988
01:28:30,040 --> 01:28:31,600
See you soon, Dora.

1989
01:28:33,320 --> 01:28:34,520
Keerthana!

1990
01:28:34,920 --> 01:28:36,240
- You are wanted!
- Darn it.

1991
01:28:36,440 --> 01:28:38,840
Interrupting all the time.

1992
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:45,600
Hi Keerthu!

1993
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:54,720
Wow!

1994
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:56,280
What a beautiful gaze!

1995
01:28:56,600 --> 01:28:58,200
Vairamuthu in his poems….

1996
01:28:58,360 --> 01:28:59,600
Can you please sit down?

1997
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:03,360
Thank you.

1998
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:05,920
I knew this would happen.

1999
01:29:06,200 --> 01:29:09,240
But this soon?
I didn't expect...

2000
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:11,160
What would you like to have?

2001
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:14,400
Just your concern
makes me swell and full.

2002
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:17,360
See,  I’m barfing.

2003
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:19,360
“A good beginning is half-done”.

2004
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:22,080
Shakespeare's words? No.

2005
01:29:22,360 --> 01:29:24,480
My manager Kuthalam’s mantra.

2006
01:29:25,240 --> 01:29:26,600
This conversation is a good start.

2007
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:29,920
What’s next? Let’s move fast.

2008
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:32,440
Fruits?

2009
01:29:32,720 --> 01:29:34,560
Secret behind glossy skin, maybe.

2010
01:29:35,480 --> 01:29:36,440
Do you know who he is?

2011
01:29:37,480 --> 01:29:40,320
I've seen him in "Supreme Saloon" banner.

2012
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:41,960

01:29:43,200 --> 01:29:44,640

My friend Auto Sekar is building a house.

2019
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:56,960
He’s looking for inexpensive cement.

2020
01:29:57,120 --> 01:29:59,200
Can you get him a discount, please?

2021
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:03,280
It’s ok. He’ll understand.

2022
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:06,080
Do you know him?

2023
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:09,600
He’s the one from the underwear ad, right?

2024
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:12,360
He is Mr Sunil Agarwal.

2025
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:14,800
Oh! Kajal Agarwal’s brother.

2026
01:30:15,320 --> 01:30:17,440

At least, do you know this gentleman?

2032
01:30:33,080 --> 01:30:35,320
You should have started with this guy.

2033
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:36,200
I know him.

2034
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:38,840
I see him everyday evening 6.30

2035
01:30:39,240 --> 01:30:39,920
Saligramam?

2036
01:30:40,040 --> 01:30:40,480

He’s the chief baker there.

2039
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:47,960
Chetta.

2040
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:51,040
Why angry?

2041
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:53,600
Not him?
Looks quite alike.

2042
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:54,880

Flies everywhere in his private jet.

2047
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:08,280
So if...?
Can I intercept, please?

2048
01:31:08,640 --> 01:31:11,600
So if the pilot is on leave,
he can't go anywhere.

2049
01:31:12,280 --> 01:31:15,400
Everytime I speak, you keep interrupting,
without any manners.

2050
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:16,760
Think you are funny?

2051
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:20,400
These gentlemen,

2052
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:25,040
proposed to me earnestly.

2053
01:31:25,560 --> 01:31:28,800
But I have rejected them all, decently.

2054
01:31:29,880 --> 01:31:30,520
Do you know why?

2055
01:31:31,080 --> 01:31:31,720
Why?

2056
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:35,240
They were worthy of my rejection.

2057
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:39,840
When you proposed me,
I didn't say a word.

2058
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:40,840
Any idea, why?

2059
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:43,240
No.

2060
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:46,360
You were not even worthy of my rejection.

2061
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:50,800
Grow up to deserve my rejection.

2062
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:52,720
You'll die of old age before that happens.

2063
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:53,440
Now get out.

2064
01:32:04,160 --> 01:32:04,880
What is this crap?

2065
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:06,360
That’s not crap.

2066
01:32:07,320 --> 01:32:09,320
I bought it on a online sale, for you.

2067
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:10,560
Dora, the explorer.

2068
01:32:11,080 --> 01:32:12,560
Just take it and get out of here.

2069
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:15,720
No it’s okay.

2070
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:19,200
Keep this as a souvenir.

2071
01:32:20,280 --> 01:32:20,960
Stupid.

2072
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:23,200
Dora!

2073
01:32:35,480 --> 01:32:37,400
450 rupees down the drain.

2074
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:39,320
Who's paying for them?

2075
01:32:46,040 --> 01:32:46,800
Hi.

2076
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:48,320
Hello, how are you?
- Fine.

2077
01:32:48,520 --> 01:32:49,920
Hi.
- How are you?

2078
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:51,080
I’m good. How are you?

2079
01:32:51,280 --> 01:32:51,960
I’m good.

2080
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:53,800
So how are your shows?

2081
01:32:54,200 --> 01:32:55,400
Couldn’t be better.

2082
01:32:56,360 --> 01:32:56,880
One second

2083
01:32:57,240 --> 01:32:57,920
It’s ok.

2084
01:33:01,480 --> 01:33:03,240
We are No 1 in the ratings.
- Oh!

2085
01:33:03,400 --> 01:33:05,280
So we have planned a series in the US.

2086
01:33:05,480 --> 01:33:07,080
Wow, my best wishes Keets.

2087
01:33:07,280 --> 01:33:07,960
Thank you.

2088
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:13,400
Hello.

2089
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:15,440
Who is this? You are bothering.

2090
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:16,840
I’m Lakshman, Madam.

2091
01:33:17,640 --> 01:33:19,040
Hello.
- Uncle … Lakshman uncle.

2092
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:21,120
Oh, uncle!.

2093
01:33:21,320 --> 01:33:23,320
You are calling from another number.
What happened?

2094
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:26,480
I had an accident on Kathipara Fly-over.

2095
01:33:26,760 --> 01:33:28,040
Broke my phone too.

2096
01:33:28,240 --> 01:33:30,040
I’m calling from a Guard’s number.

2097
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:31,280
Can you help me out?
- Hello?

2098
01:33:31,400 --> 01:33:33,840
- My leg is hurting.
- Uncle, where are you?

2099
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:40,480
Hello, Apollo Emergency Services.

2100
01:33:40,640 --> 01:33:42,160
Hello, this is Keerthana Vasudevan.

2101
01:33:42,280 --> 01:33:42,640
Yes Madam.

2102
01:33:42,840 --> 01:33:45,040
Send an ambulance to Kathipara Fly-over.

2103
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:46,640
It’s an emergency.
- Ok madam.

2104
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:47,760
Are you there?

2105
01:33:47,960 --> 01:33:49,880
No no, I’ll be there in 15 minutes.

2106
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:51,840
Call me once you reach there.
- Sure mam.

2107
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:52,560
Thank you.

2108
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:08,800
Hello.
Excuse me.

2109
01:34:09,120 --> 01:34:09,960
Whose cart is this?

2110
01:34:10,280 --> 01:34:11,960
You are blocking the road.

2111
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:13,240
Nonsense.

2112
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:17,280
(Imitating computerized voice in Telugu)

2113
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:22,920
(In Tamil - The customer you have dialed
is busy eating, please call him later).

2114
01:34:23,080 --> 01:34:25,320
Or, his Kulfi will melt.

2115
01:34:26,840 --> 01:34:30,160
(In Lakshman’s voice – Keerthu Madam, I’m hurting).

2116
01:34:30,360 --> 01:34:31,480
(My leg is hurting)

2117
01:34:32,920 --> 01:34:34,800
Hello.
Where do you think you are going?

2118
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:38,120
He said he’s gonna propose to you
and asked for a Dora doll online.

2119
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:40,640
Today, he wants an ice cream cart
for his proposal.

2120
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:42,040
Who pays for these?

2121
01:34:42,240 --> 01:34:43,600
Obviously, you.

2122
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:44,880
You make TV shows, right?

2123
01:34:45,040 --> 01:34:45,600
Pay up.

2124
01:34:45,800 --> 01:34:47,240
Your “Thoppul kodi” show is a hit,
isn't it?

2125
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:49,720
It's spare change for you.
- Keerthana Vasudevan!

2126
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:54,800
Aren't you splurging on your makeup?

2127
01:34:54,960 --> 01:34:56,880
Can't you pay this small tab?

2128
01:34:57,200 --> 01:34:58,880
Can't you hear me? Huh?

2129
01:34:59,120 --> 01:34:59,720
Hey...

2130
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:01,160
Answer it.

2131
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:03,840
Hello.

2132
01:35:04,040 --> 01:35:05,080
Hello Keerthana madam?

2133
01:35:05,800 --> 01:35:06,600
Yes tell me.

2134
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:08,240
This is Apollo ambulance driver.

2135
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:10,280
Where are you?

2136
01:35:10,840 --> 01:35:11,960
- Do you want some?
- Huh… err….

2137
01:35:12,080 --> 01:35:12,880
- Yes tell me.

2138
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:14,960
No, Wrong information.

2139
01:35:15,160 --> 01:35:16,640
Sorry? Wrong information?

2140
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:17,920
Are you kidding me?

2141
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:18,880
Aren’t you educated?

2142
01:35:19,200 --> 01:35:20,160
Are you high?

2143
01:35:20,520 --> 01:35:25,360
Been getting too many pranks of late.
- Baby, she's getting told off.

2144
01:35:25,640 --> 01:35:27,360
One day, you'll need us for real.

2145
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:28,720
You’ll regret it then.

2146
01:35:29,120 --> 01:35:29,760
Cut the call.

2147
01:35:31,200 --> 01:35:31,960
Hey...

2148
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:33,480
Baby?

2149
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:34,560
Showtime!

2150
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:35,760
Start.

2151
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:38,960
Name is Manimeglai.
From Kaaraikudi.

2152
01:35:39,040 --> 01:35:40,960
Resides in our colony, second floor.

2153
01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:44,160
Has proposed like twenty times
with her looks.

2154
01:35:44,440 --> 01:35:45,480
Wanna see an impression?

2155
01:35:45,800 --> 01:35:46,600
Baby,

2156
01:35:47,080 --> 01:35:47,960
Show her a demo.

2157
01:35:50,920 --> 01:35:52,280
But I turned her down.

2158
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:53,920
Baby, next.

2159
01:35:54,720 --> 01:35:56,840

2160
01:35:57,120 --> 01:35:58,760
Based in our colony but next block.

2161
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:04,040
When she walks out all bejeweled,
the colony becomes fixated.

2162
01:36:04,240 --> 01:36:04,960
Baby.

2163
01:36:05,080 --> 01:36:05,960
Here goes.

2164
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:11,800
But I’ve never bothered.

2165
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:14,440
Baby, next.

2166
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:17,240
Name is Parvathy.
From Ernakulam.

2167
01:36:17,360 --> 01:36:19,320
Was in our colony,
now moved to the next one.

2168
01:36:19,480 --> 01:36:20,840
Just two days back.

2169
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:22,920
Helped them move their things.
Paid me 200 rupees.

2170
01:36:23,080 --> 01:36:23,720
Unlike you.

2171
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:26,720
Specialist in cooking
Puttu, Kondaikadalai, Appam.

2172
01:36:26,840 --> 01:36:29,560
Never have accepted her repeated proposals.

2173
01:36:29,720 --> 01:36:30,600
You know why?

2174
01:36:31,120 --> 01:36:33,120
How will she know?
Let her know.

2175
01:36:33,200 --> 01:36:33,880
Yea go ahead.

2176
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:36,120
You know why I rejected them all?

2177
01:36:36,360 --> 01:36:37,160
Dora!

2178
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:40,720
Just give me a nod and
I’ll marry you right now.

2179
01:36:41,080 --> 01:36:42,720
Baby, what say?

2180
01:36:43,040 --> 01:36:43,840
I said nothing.

2181
01:36:44,160 --> 01:36:44,960
Dude...

2182
01:36:45,480 --> 01:36:46,360
Music!

2183
01:36:46,520 --> 01:36:48,320
Time for some auspicious music.

2184
01:36:50,360 --> 01:36:51,520
Engagement.

2185
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:52,640
Am I right?

2186
01:36:58,120 --> 01:36:59,080
No hurries.

2187
01:36:59,360 --> 01:37:02,400
Think about this all night and
accept it in the morning.

2188
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:03,720
Ok?

2189
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:06,760
See you.

2190
01:37:15,400 --> 01:37:16,840
Baby, baby, baby... Hey!

2191
01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:20,400
Madam!

2192
01:37:20,760 --> 01:37:21,560
Where are you off to?

2193
01:37:21,800 --> 01:37:22,400
Get the….

2194
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:23,920
Maybe you don't have your wallet.

2195
01:37:24,080 --> 01:37:26,240
I’ll Whatsapp account details.
Wire transfer it.

2196
01:37:26,520 --> 01:37:27,440
Why are you glaring?

2197
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:29,120
You must pay up.

2198
01:37:29,480 --> 01:37:30,880
You have got nothing on me.

2199
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:31,840
Glaring…

2200
01:37:32,040 --> 01:37:33,320
God, she’s frightening.

2201
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:34,280
Manohar is dead!

2202
01:37:34,480 --> 01:37:37,280
Hey muscians, let’s hear it.

2203
01:37:40,120 --> 01:37:40,800
Hello.
- Hello.

2204
01:37:41,040 --> 01:37:43,080
- Uncle.
- Keerthu, why are you calling at this hour?

2205
01:37:43,320 --> 01:37:45,080
I don’t care what you would do,

2206
01:37:45,480 --> 01:37:47,320
I should never see Manohar ever again.

2207
01:37:55,720 --> 01:37:56,640
Play it in.

2208
01:37:57,640 --> 01:37:59,080
Pass it properly, baby.

2209
01:37:59,160 --> 01:38:00,520
You know I didn't pass 2nd grade.

2210
01:38:00,640 --> 01:38:02,160
Passing ain't my game.

2211
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:09,040
Hey, why didn't you score?

2212
01:38:09,160 --> 01:38:10,760
- He's their goalkeeper.
- Then why didn't you?

2213
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:12,120
He threw the ball at me.

2214
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:13,160
Sorry, bro.

2215
01:38:13,640 --> 01:38:14,320
Was an accident.

2216
01:38:14,520 --> 01:38:15,920
Let it go.
He didn’t mean it.

2217
01:38:16,240 --> 01:38:18,280
Look at his beard, like Aladdin's lamp.

2218
01:38:18,400 --> 01:38:19,400
So boring.

2219
01:38:19,720 --> 01:38:20,680
Not a good one?
- Nope.

2220
01:38:20,840 --> 01:38:23,160
I'll be back with a good one.

2221
01:38:27,640 --> 01:38:29,560
Look here, it was me bro.

2222
01:38:30,120 --> 01:38:30,960
This time meant it.

2223
01:38:33,960 --> 01:38:34,960
Second time baby.

2224
01:38:36,040 --> 01:38:37,440
They are not from our hood.

2225
01:38:37,720 --> 01:38:39,040
Trying to block the game.

2226
01:38:39,360 --> 01:38:40,960
We’ll handle them after the game.

2227
01:38:41,240 --> 01:38:41,840
Come.

2228
01:38:42,200 --> 01:38:42,920
You’ll handle?

2229
01:38:43,080 --> 01:38:44,840
You'll run home after the game, won't you?

2230
01:38:45,400 --> 01:38:48,800
Hey, I had to take a crap once.
Won't you ever forget it.

2231
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:51,200
Come on!
Pass it here!

2232
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:54,080
What do I do now?

2233
01:38:54,360 --> 01:38:55,560
Shoot it, bro!

2234
01:39:03,960 --> 01:39:04,680
Bro...

2235
01:39:13,400 --> 01:39:16,200
Stop glaring. You get pissed
when someone messes with you right?

2236
01:39:16,480 --> 01:39:17,480
Same with our madam.

2237
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:19,680
She’ll get pissed too.

2238
01:39:19,880 --> 01:39:20,800
Got it?

2239
01:39:21,120 --> 01:39:23,920
If you ever come into her life….

2240
01:39:26,120 --> 01:39:26,880
Hey...

2241
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:29,760
You never finished it.

2242
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:37,480
Bro...

2243
01:39:38,040 --> 01:39:38,480
What?

2244
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:40,840
The game never stops for anything.

2245
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:42,840
Rock on baby.

2246
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:44,960
It’s our game now.

2247
01:39:45,200 --> 01:39:46,360
Cut the….

2248
01:41:24,480 --> 01:41:25,120
Up.

2249
01:41:28,920 --> 01:41:32,280
The "Madam" who sent you,
where is she?

2250
01:41:34,920 --> 01:41:38,720
I saw your horoscope today, it said...

2251
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:43,960
Who let you in?

2252
01:41:44,200 --> 01:41:46,800
Don't be too respectful kid. Sit down.
- How dare you….

2253
01:41:46,960 --> 01:41:49,480
Listen.
The day you fire him, you'll do well girl.

2254
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:51,960
Mind your language,
call me girl ever again...

2255
01:41:52,160 --> 01:41:53,480
What will you do, girl?

2256
01:41:54,240 --> 01:41:57,040
Sending goons to bash me up,
why would I mind the language girl?

2257
01:41:57,280 --> 01:41:58,040
What nonsense?

2258
01:41:58,280 --> 01:42:00,240
I never sent anyone.
Are you mad?

2259
01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:01,160
Oh no….

2260
01:42:01,560 --> 01:42:03,640
There was a high school teacher
named Walter White,

2261
01:42:03,800 --> 01:42:05,480
Turns out he was a Drug Lord.

2262
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:06,880
Sounds like that story.

2263
01:42:07,040 --> 01:42:08,960
He’s with you all day.

2264
01:42:09,120 --> 01:42:10,960
And you have him around .

2265
01:42:11,120 --> 01:42:13,400
But you have no idea of what he does?

2266
01:42:14,760 --> 01:42:15,640
Applause.

2267
01:42:15,800 --> 01:42:17,200
What a performance!

2268
01:42:23,080 --> 01:42:24,880
You know how highly I thought of you?

2269
01:42:25,160 --> 01:42:26,640
Here, higher.

2270
01:42:27,240 --> 01:42:30,480
But you stooped so low.

2271
01:42:30,760 --> 01:42:32,120
Oh God, this guy is disgusting.

2272
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:34,480
Yes we are discussing.
Today's discussion.

2273
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:40,960
Thought we would be all like “what’s up dude,
let’s have a game of snooker?”

2274
01:42:41,720 --> 01:42:45,720
I’m from the masses,
came through public schooling and welfare schemes.

2275
01:42:45,960 --> 01:42:48,400
Nothing can stop me.

2276
01:42:49,120 --> 01:42:52,400
If I start playing dirty… you can’t take it.

2277
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:53,960
- How dare you…?
- Shut up uncle.

2278
01:42:54,120 --> 01:42:56,920
You sent sloppy goons
and embarrassed my girlfriend.

2279
01:42:57,320 --> 01:42:58,440
Who's your girlfriend?

2280
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:00,240
You are crossing your limits.

2281
01:43:00,480 --> 01:43:01,960
One more word and I'll kill you.

2282
01:43:02,680 --> 01:43:06,640
My bae just turned Annabelle!

2283
01:43:07,320 --> 01:43:08,440
Watch it.
- It's alright.

2284
01:43:08,680 --> 01:43:10,480
I've seen her soft aggression.

2285
01:43:10,720 --> 01:43:13,520
Watching her unleash it today,
I'm scared uncle.

2286
01:43:13,680 --> 01:43:14,160
Crap.

2287
01:43:15,160 --> 01:43:18,480
Keep losing your temper
and you’ll lose good guys like me.

2288
01:43:18,760 --> 01:43:20,840
Be around with your coterie till your end.

2289
01:43:21,360 --> 01:43:22,120
Listen.

2290
01:43:22,400 --> 01:43:24,560
Not many would be frank to your face,
like me.

2291
01:43:24,920 --> 01:43:28,400
They'll hold a grudge
and run over you with a truck, one day.

2292
01:43:30,680 --> 01:43:31,240
Bro.

2293
01:43:31,720 --> 01:43:33,120
Take care of the helmet bro.

2294
01:43:34,080 --> 01:43:34,520
Idiot.

2295
01:43:34,720 --> 01:43:36,360
Always with his Dora, Flora...

2296
01:43:38,760 --> 01:43:39,920
Hey, did you just say Dora?

2297
01:43:40,040 --> 01:43:41,760
I never mentioned it all this time .

2298
01:43:41,960 --> 01:43:43,120
Did I?
- Nope.

2299
01:43:43,320 --> 01:43:44,560
See?

2300
01:43:46,080 --> 01:43:48,960
So Dora is in your heart somewhere.

2301
01:43:51,560 --> 01:43:53,040
(In Malayalam - I always knew it.

2302
01:43:53,480 --> 01:43:56,320
Keerthu will come find Mano, one day.

2303
01:43:56,760 --> 01:43:57,920
I’ll make sure of it.

2304
01:43:58,480 --> 01:44:01,840
And I'll have my favourite Dora all to myself.

2305
01:44:02,160 --> 01:44:02,800
Got it?

2306
01:44:03,080 --> 01:44:04,560
Got it, uncle?).

2307
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:05,920
Goodbye.

2308
01:44:06,200 --> 01:44:06,760
Keerthu mam...

2309
01:44:06,920 --> 01:44:09,640
Let me take another crack at him.

2310
01:44:11,760 --> 01:44:14,480
Have you ever been useful to me?

2311
01:44:14,680 --> 01:44:16,240
No mam, I thought that through.

2312
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:18,800
I got men on parole…

2313
01:44:18,960 --> 01:44:19,560
Shut up!

2314
01:44:20,200 --> 01:44:21,560
I don't wanna see you ever again.

2315
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:22,760
Get lost.

2316
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:25,160
Haven't I told you to mind the sugar?
- Hey!

2317
01:44:44,480 --> 01:44:47,360
All these snacks are homemade.

2318
01:44:47,720 --> 01:44:50,280
Mano loves them.
- Yea they are so good!

2319
01:44:50,400 --> 01:44:52,760
Nice, we were just talking about you.

2320
01:44:53,120 --> 01:44:56,800
He promptly picks his phone,
except while driving.

2321
01:44:56,960 --> 01:44:57,840
That’s a good habit.

2322
01:44:58,040 --> 01:44:58,800
Oh God.

2323
01:44:59,160 --> 01:45:00,880
What are you looking at?

2324
01:45:01,040 --> 01:45:02,240
Saw him when he was a kid.

2325
01:45:02,680 --> 01:45:04,040
Now, he’s all grown up.

2326
01:45:04,320 --> 01:45:05,720
Yea, I ate my proteins.

2327
01:45:06,280 --> 01:45:07,960
Go wash your face son.

2328
01:45:08,360 --> 01:45:09,320
Hey, come in.

2329
01:45:09,720 --> 01:45:09,920
What?

2330
01:45:10,080 --> 01:45:12,280
He’s loves playing sports...
- I said come in.

2331
01:45:12,720 --> 01:45:15,200
Football especially.

2332
01:45:15,760 --> 01:45:17,440
He admires "lassi"

2333
01:45:17,680 --> 01:45:19,040
Lassi?
- Yea him.

2334
01:45:19,280 --> 01:45:20,200
No, that's Messi.

2335
01:45:20,360 --> 01:45:21,960
Oh ok.

2336
01:45:22,240 --> 01:45:22,680
What’s up?

2337
01:45:23,080 --> 01:45:24,040
What’s happening here?

2338
01:45:24,320 --> 01:45:25,080
Who are they?

2339
01:45:25,560 --> 01:45:27,320
You are being courted.

2340
01:45:27,760 --> 01:45:30,280
So, put on your best dress.

2341
01:45:30,520 --> 01:45:31,720
Wash your face.

2342
01:45:32,200 --> 01:45:34,960
Put Vermilion
Sorry, sorry have “Vibuthi”.

2343
01:45:35,200 --> 01:45:37,480
Present yourself and wish everyone.

2344
01:45:37,800 --> 01:45:38,960
And sing a song.

2345
01:45:39,400 --> 01:45:41,760
(Singing terribly)

2346
01:45:42,120 --> 01:45:42,960
Slap you.

2347
01:45:43,440 --> 01:45:44,960
Call mom.
- Weirdo.

2348
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:48,480
Everyone is fond of him.
Especially, kids.

2349
01:45:49,160 --> 01:45:50,520
Mom, brother wants you.

2350
01:45:50,720 --> 01:45:52,400
Oh, one minute.

2351
01:45:53,280 --> 01:45:54,120
... we'll handle.

2352
01:45:54,280 --> 01:45:55,520
What do you want son?

2353
01:45:56,120 --> 01:45:58,480
Mom, are you serious?

2354
01:45:58,800 --> 01:45:59,840
What have you done?

2355
01:46:00,040 --> 01:46:01,720
How's the girl? Nice right?

2356
01:46:01,960 --> 01:46:03,560
Who… asked for this?

2357
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:04,920
Did I ask to get married?

2358
01:46:05,080 --> 01:46:07,160
You wanna get married, I know it.

2359
01:46:07,280 --> 01:46:08,200
How do you say so?

2360
01:46:08,360 --> 01:46:10,480
You are arguing everyday with Keerthana.

2361
01:46:10,840 --> 01:46:13,320
Marry this Kavitha.
Keep arguing every day, ok?

2362
01:46:13,480 --> 01:46:15,680
Mom, both start with K!

2363
01:46:15,800 --> 01:46:16,840
Keerthana, Kavitha.

2364
01:46:17,040 --> 01:46:17,760
K and K.

2365
01:46:17,960 --> 01:46:18,360
Yes!

2366
01:46:19,240 --> 01:46:22,080
So change your dress quick.
Come soon.

2367
01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:24,520
Mom, Ma, Ma....

2368
01:46:25,800 --> 01:46:27,560
He asks if jeans is okay.

2369
01:46:27,760 --> 01:46:28,920
Anything is fine aunty.

2370
01:46:29,120 --> 01:46:30,920
Son, she says anything is fine.

2371
01:46:31,400 --> 01:46:33,280
He consults everything.

2372
01:46:33,440 --> 01:46:34,480
So innocent.

2373
01:46:39,280 --> 01:46:40,840
I’m love with another woman.

2374
01:46:41,320 --> 01:46:42,440
I’m planning to marry her.

2375
01:46:43,800 --> 01:46:44,720
Son, what are you saying?

2376
01:46:44,840 --> 01:46:45,800
Mom, you don’t know.

2377
01:46:46,120 --> 01:46:47,400
I’ve not told you this.

2378
01:46:49,560 --> 01:46:51,360
Mom, invited you out of ignorance.

2379
01:46:52,120 --> 01:46:53,480
Please don’t mistake her.

2380
01:46:55,400 --> 01:46:55,960
Sorry.

2381
01:46:56,760 --> 01:46:58,120
It’s okay. No problem.

2382
01:46:58,400 --> 01:47:00,120
Please don't insult anybody else.

2383
01:47:00,720 --> 01:47:01,880
Mom, let’s move.

2384
01:47:02,640 --> 01:47:04,760
You have no idea about your son.

2385
01:47:04,960 --> 01:47:06,280
Is this how you raised him?

2386
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:07,920
Drop it brother.

2387
01:47:08,360 --> 01:47:10,720
It is how fatherless homes are.

2388
01:47:10,880 --> 01:47:11,960
Let’s go.
- Move.

2389
01:47:12,120 --> 01:47:14,400
Uncle, let’s try to sort things.
- Such insult.

2390
01:47:14,640 --> 01:47:15,720
Sir….
- Keep moving.

2391
01:47:18,160 --> 01:47:19,800
Wait, what is this?

2392
01:47:20,200 --> 01:47:22,680
By tradition,
it should be us who should court them.

2393
01:47:23,160 --> 01:47:26,240
But they didn't mind the formality, for me.

2394
01:47:26,640 --> 01:47:28,240
Why did you behave like that?

2395
01:47:28,640 --> 01:47:29,960
Why did you insult me?

2396
01:47:30,200 --> 01:47:32,800
You did the same to me,
by not taking my consent.

2397
01:47:32,960 --> 01:47:35,120
Did I take your consent for your every need?

2398
01:47:35,320 --> 01:47:36,320
Why should that change?

2399
01:47:36,480 --> 01:47:38,320
So far no, but hereon you should ask.

2400
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:40,440
Mom, you are intruding.

2401
01:47:40,720 --> 01:47:42,120
This is my life, I’ll take care of it.

2402
01:47:45,840 --> 01:47:46,880
Your life?

2403
01:47:48,360 --> 01:47:49,640
What has gotten into you?

2404
01:47:49,880 --> 01:47:53,320
I raised you as a single mom, with such care.

2405
01:47:54,040 --> 01:47:57,440
But you insulted me in front of our relatives.

2406
01:47:58,160 --> 01:47:59,440
They were right.

2407
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:02,720
Fatherless home, right?

2408
01:48:03,320 --> 01:48:04,480
Mom, mom. - Out of my way.

2409
01:48:05,240 --> 01:48:06,120
Why bro?

2410
01:48:06,400 --> 01:48:07,200
Mom!

2411
01:48:20,640 --> 01:48:21,120
Hello.

2412
01:48:21,320 --> 01:48:21,880
Keerthana.

2413
01:48:22,120 --> 01:48:23,960
Yes Sir.
- Is this a right time to call you?

2414
01:48:24,120 --> 01:48:25,280
You have already called...

2415
01:48:26,480 --> 01:48:27,520
Yes Sir, go on.

2416
01:48:28,120 --> 01:48:29,960
We have changed
your "Kungumam" show timings.

2417
01:48:30,200 --> 01:48:32,480
From 8.30 pm to 1 pm.

2418
01:48:32,680 --> 01:48:33,280
What?

2419
01:48:34,240 --> 01:48:35,400
May I know the reason Sir?

2420
01:48:35,560 --> 01:48:38,680
Didn’t you see our official email?

2421
01:48:38,960 --> 01:48:41,400
Sorry, I was busy… must have missed it.

2422
01:48:41,680 --> 01:48:42,280
It’s okay.

2423
01:48:42,480 --> 01:48:46,120
Day by day, the ratings of your Kungumam show
is dropping down.

2424
01:48:46,400 --> 01:48:47,240
That's the reason.

2425
01:48:47,400 --> 01:48:49,400
But Sir, we were just working on it.

2426
01:48:49,640 --> 01:48:51,280
It'll improve in the upcoming weeks.

2427
01:48:51,480 --> 01:48:53,520
So give us the prime slot please.

2428
01:48:53,720 --> 01:48:56,480
Don't worry, if the ratings pick up,
we'll consider.

2429
01:48:56,720 --> 01:48:58,720
By the way, why did you change Sowmiya?

2430
01:48:58,920 --> 01:49:00,880
The ratings were good when she was there.

2431
01:49:01,080 --> 01:49:02,400
Anyway, it is your decision.

2432
01:49:02,640 --> 01:49:03,720
But you can think about it.

2433
01:49:03,920 --> 01:49:04,800
Thank you. Good night.

2434
01:49:19,560 --> 01:49:20,960
Look at mom, brother.

2435
01:49:22,040 --> 01:49:23,760
She's been here for a long time.

2436
01:49:24,320 --> 01:49:26,920
She won’t mind if I argue with her.

2437
01:49:27,480 --> 01:49:30,240
But with you, she becomes deeply upset.

2438
01:49:31,400 --> 01:49:32,840
She hasn’t eaten anything.

2439
01:49:33,400 --> 01:49:34,760
Come, let’s pacify.

2440
01:49:46,240 --> 01:49:46,960
Mom...

2441
01:49:47,920 --> 01:49:50,040
Brother has something to tell you.

2442
01:49:51,120 --> 01:49:51,960
Oh God!

2443
01:49:56,800 --> 01:49:57,360
Ma...

2444
01:49:59,960 --> 01:50:00,680
Ma!

2445
01:50:01,400 --> 01:50:04,280
I was out of my mind.
Spoke out of line.

2446
01:50:05,560 --> 01:50:06,440
Sorry ma.

2447
01:50:08,400 --> 01:50:10,680
Ma, he is apologizing.

2448
01:50:10,960 --> 01:50:12,320
Forget it. Let’s go eat.

2449
01:50:14,480 --> 01:50:15,120
Bro!

2450
01:50:16,240 --> 01:50:16,920
Mom!

2451
01:50:17,560 --> 01:50:20,480
Mom I didn’t mean it.
Why are you crying?

2452
01:50:20,880 --> 01:50:22,120
Don’t cry ma.

2453
01:50:23,160 --> 01:50:27,360
No, you weren't out of your mind.
You were quite mindful.

2454
01:50:28,200 --> 01:50:29,640
You have grown up.

2455
01:50:30,320 --> 01:50:31,640
I didn’t realise it.

2456
01:50:33,560 --> 01:50:36,080
You have always listened to me
since you were kid.

2457
01:50:36,720 --> 01:50:39,400
I thought you would continue to be the same.

2458
01:50:40,160 --> 01:50:41,760
Sorry dear, sorry.

2459
01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:45,480
I won't do anything without
consulting with you.

2460
01:50:46,160 --> 01:50:49,960
Ma, I still listen to you.

2461
01:50:50,400 --> 01:50:52,520
So, you want me to marry your choice, right?

2462
01:50:52,760 --> 01:50:54,960
Ask Anitha to come around tomorrow,
we'll fix it.

2463
01:50:57,160 --> 01:50:59,680
She’s not Anitha?
Sunitha maybe?

2464
01:50:59,960 --> 01:51:00,960
It’s Kavitha.

2465
01:51:01,920 --> 01:51:02,800
Name is not the point.

2466
01:51:02,920 --> 01:51:05,040
I’ll marry her tomorrow.

2467
01:51:06,320 --> 01:51:09,200
You are trying to make me smile,
aren't you?

2468
01:51:09,760 --> 01:51:11,840
You know everything Ma!

2469
01:51:11,960 --> 01:51:12,720
Super Ma!

2470
01:51:12,920 --> 01:51:14,480
Come let's eat.
- Come.

2471
01:51:15,480 --> 01:51:16,480
Son, stop.

2472
01:51:17,240 --> 01:51:21,680
Dinner can wait,
who are you in love with?

2473
01:51:22,200 --> 01:51:23,200
In love?
- Yea.

2474
01:51:23,360 --> 01:51:24,720
Me?
- Yep.

2475
01:51:24,840 --> 01:51:25,960
You must be kidding.

2476
01:51:26,160 --> 01:51:27,280
I bluffed, mom.

2477
01:51:27,400 --> 01:51:28,240
He’s bluffing now.

2478
01:51:28,400 --> 01:51:29,680
Shut up.
- Get out.

2479
01:51:31,440 --> 01:51:32,080
Mom!

2480
01:51:32,440 --> 01:51:34,160
I swear, I’m not in love with anyone.

2481
01:51:34,360 --> 01:51:35,960
I cooked it up to send them away.

2482
01:51:36,320 --> 01:51:36,960
True story.

2483
01:51:37,160 --> 01:51:39,040
Ma, don’t think I’m out of line.

2484
01:51:39,160 --> 01:51:40,240
You always are.

2485
01:51:40,400 --> 01:51:41,560
Right mom?
- Wrong.

2486
01:51:42,040 --> 01:51:43,400
She's perfectly in line.

2487
01:51:43,560 --> 01:51:44,240
Her?
- Yep.

2488
01:51:44,520 --> 01:51:45,360
You tell me.

2489
01:51:46,200 --> 01:51:48,640
I can find out who is in his heart for real.

2490
01:51:48,760 --> 01:51:49,720
There’s a game for it.

2491
01:51:49,920 --> 01:51:52,880
Behold!
The Grandmaster of Reverse Quiz

2492
01:51:53,160 --> 01:51:55,240
Better than reverse quiz.
I have read it on the internet.

2493
01:51:55,440 --> 01:51:58,240
Close your eyes
and imagine the things I say. Ok?

2494
01:51:58,520 --> 01:51:59,760
I’ll pop a question.

2495
01:51:59,920 --> 01:52:01,400
You should reply in an instant.

2496
01:52:01,520 --> 01:52:03,760
We’ll find who’s your One, ok?

2497
01:52:04,080 --> 01:52:05,720
Don't you read
academics on the internet?

2498
01:52:05,840 --> 01:52:07,360
She’s rambling.
Let’s go mom.

2499
01:52:07,480 --> 01:52:08,480
Hey...
- Ma!

2500
01:52:09,160 --> 01:52:10,960
She has a point.
Ask him, dear.

2501
01:52:11,160 --> 01:52:11,920
Close your eyes.

2502
01:52:12,960 --> 01:52:13,560
Mom...

2503
01:52:13,800 --> 01:52:14,720
Shut it.

2504
01:52:16,320 --> 01:52:17,360
Shut your eyes.

2505
01:52:20,240 --> 01:52:21,960
You have joined a bigger company.

2506
01:52:22,160 --> 01:52:23,760
You are the head of the showroom.

2507
01:52:27,920 --> 01:52:30,440
Who are you tomorrow
begins with what you do today.

2508
01:52:30,760 --> 01:52:32,280
Good morning ladies and gentlemen.

2509
01:52:32,560 --> 01:52:34,240
An important presentation…

2510
01:52:34,520 --> 01:52:36,760
You hold the floor.

2511
01:52:37,120 --> 01:52:38,920
All eyes on you.

2512
01:52:39,160 --> 01:52:41,720
Our mission is to become world leader
in this field.

2513
01:52:41,920 --> 01:52:43,480
Just then your phone rings.

2514
01:52:43,920 --> 01:52:44,880
Mom on the line.

2515
01:52:45,120 --> 01:52:46,120
Excuse me guys.

2516
01:52:46,720 --> 01:52:49,320
Mom!
- Mano, your wife is in labor.

2517
01:52:49,480 --> 01:52:49,960
When?

2518
01:52:50,120 --> 01:52:52,400
Just now.
Come quickly to the hospital.

2519
01:52:52,760 --> 01:52:53,280
Ok .
- Quick.

2520
01:52:53,480 --> 01:52:54,200
I’m on my way.

2521
01:52:54,320 --> 01:52:56,680
You excused yourself and hurried…

2522
01:52:57,320 --> 01:52:59,840
You wanted to see your wife and child badly.

2523
01:53:00,120 --> 01:53:02,840
You were stressed with their well being.

2524
01:53:04,400 --> 01:53:08,240
You ran to your car.
Sped out of there.

2525
01:53:09,800 --> 01:53:11,280
Stressed to the limit on your way.

2526
01:53:12,240 --> 01:53:15,320
Despite traffic,
you arrived quickly at the hospital.

2527
01:53:17,480 --> 01:53:19,560
Running towards the reception,
you asked for the room number.

2528
01:53:19,720 --> 01:53:20,880
Room no 318.

2529
01:53:21,240 --> 01:53:21,840
Third floor.

2530
01:53:22,120 --> 01:53:23,120
Third floor?
- Yea.

2531
01:53:23,840 --> 01:53:27,480
Shunning the elevator,
you took the stairs.

2532
01:53:28,360 --> 01:53:30,360
Looking frantically for the room...

2533
01:53:35,400 --> 01:53:37,400
Finally, you found it.

2534
01:53:42,800 --> 01:53:44,800
Anxiously, you opened the door.

2535
01:53:45,200 --> 01:53:47,080
Your wife was there with your child.

2536
01:53:48,640 --> 01:53:49,840
Tell me who did you see?

2537
01:53:57,040 --> 01:53:57,920
Say it brother.

2538
01:53:58,080 --> 01:53:59,280
Who did you see?

2539
01:54:02,200 --> 01:54:03,160
What are you thinking?

2540
01:54:03,320 --> 01:54:04,920
Mom, you sleep after dinner.
I’ll be back.

2541
01:54:05,480 --> 01:54:08,960
Mano, Mano...

2542
01:54:09,560 --> 01:54:11,120
Mano say something.

2543
01:54:11,400 --> 01:54:12,120
Mom!

2544
01:54:12,720 --> 01:54:14,640
He's in love with Keerthana.

2545
01:54:15,240 --> 01:54:16,320
How sure are you?

2546
01:54:16,440 --> 01:54:17,720
100 percentage.

2547
01:54:18,320 --> 01:54:19,320
How?

2548
01:54:19,720 --> 01:54:21,880
You are old-school Ma,
you won't get it.

2549
01:54:22,040 --> 01:54:23,120
Old-school?

2550
01:55:36,680 --> 01:55:37,280
Keerthana.

2551
01:55:42,720 --> 01:55:43,680
Sorry Keerthana.

2552
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:45,240
Sorry for everything.

2553
01:55:45,680 --> 01:55:47,720
All these days, I've hurt you.

2554
01:55:48,160 --> 01:55:49,720
I will never do that again.

2555
01:55:50,040 --> 01:55:50,600
I'm...

2556
01:55:51,360 --> 01:55:52,720
I’m really sorry, Keerthana.

2557
01:55:53,120 --> 01:55:56,840
First you embarrassed me.

2558
01:55:57,560 --> 01:55:59,680
Then you irritated me, trying to woo me.

2559
01:55:59,880 --> 01:56:01,160
Now you have started a sorry.

2560
01:56:03,280 --> 01:56:04,000
Who are you?

2561
01:56:04,520 --> 01:56:05,640
Why are you harassing me?

2562
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:07,640
I’m not here to harass you... Keerthana.

2563
01:56:09,120 --> 01:56:09,840
Forget it.

2564
01:56:10,040 --> 01:56:11,120
I don’t wanna argue.

2565
01:56:12,320 --> 01:56:14,440
I don’t know how you will respond.

2566
01:56:14,840 --> 01:56:15,480
But...

2567
01:56:15,760 --> 01:56:18,240
I want to pour my heart out.

2568
01:56:18,760 --> 01:56:20,920
I needed peace for a few moments.

2569
01:56:21,440 --> 01:56:23,320
You have spoiled...
- Keerthana, just a minute.

2570
01:56:23,960 --> 01:56:25,400
Please hear me out.

2571
01:56:25,520 --> 01:56:27,800
Arrgh... This guy is irritating to the core.

2572
01:56:31,560 --> 01:56:32,280
Keerthana

2573
01:56:33,160 --> 01:56:33,840
Keerthana!

2574
01:56:34,400 --> 01:56:38,840
I admit that I have irritated,
tortured,embarrassed you. Laughed at you.

2575
01:56:39,240 --> 01:56:40,240
But this is different.

2576
01:56:40,640 --> 01:56:42,840
Without even realizing,
I think I have fallen….

2577
01:56:43,720 --> 01:56:45,480
I want to tell you
what's on my mind right now.

2578
01:56:45,920 --> 01:56:47,160
I love you, Keerthana.

2579
01:56:53,480 --> 01:56:54,840
Keerthana, Keerthana...

2580
01:56:55,480 --> 01:56:56,560
Please, kee….

2581
01:57:11,320 --> 01:57:12,320
Hey!

2582
01:57:36,160 --> 01:57:41,000
If you say yes,
While we hold hands,

2583
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:46,320
A light fills my universe.

2584
01:57:46,720 --> 01:57:51,000
If you throw me a smile,
In love that’s not vile,

2585
01:57:52,280 --> 01:57:56,680
My soul walks the heaven's aisle.

2586
01:57:56,960 --> 01:57:57,480
Auto!

2587
01:57:57,760 --> 01:58:01,840
One day these troubles will go away,

2588
01:58:02,120 --> 01:58:06,800
Looking back, we’ll laugh it all away.

2589
01:58:07,320 --> 01:58:12,120
One day these troubles will go away,

2590
01:58:12,520 --> 01:58:17,280
Looking back, we’ll laugh it all away.

2591
01:58:17,840 --> 01:58:22,840
If you say yes,
While we hold hands,

2592
01:58:23,720 --> 01:58:27,840
A light fills my universe.

2593
01:58:49,600 --> 01:58:54,600
The road I took led me into a maze,

2594
01:58:54,760 --> 01:58:59,880
With you by my side, I wouldn’t faze.

2595
01:59:00,440 --> 01:59:05,400
I wanna let it all out,

2596
01:59:05,600 --> 01:59:09,560
It’s just a veneer, do not doubt.

2597
01:59:09,800 --> 01:59:14,600
Your furrows,
Cut in my heart, deep furrows.

2598
01:59:14,840 --> 01:59:20,040
Would you believe this jolly good fellow?

2599
01:59:21,040 --> 01:59:25,840
If you say yes,
While we hold hands,

2600
01:59:26,560 --> 01:59:31,200
A light fills my universe.

2601
01:59:31,520 --> 01:59:36,840
If you throw me a smile,
In love that’s not vile,

2602
01:59:37,160 --> 01:59:41,800
My soul walks the heaven’s aisle.

2603
01:59:52,120 --> 01:59:53,200
You got off.

2604
01:59:54,360 --> 01:59:55,960
Keerthu madam is out of danger.

2605
01:59:56,520 --> 01:59:57,840
Doctor said she’s safe.

2606
01:59:59,160 --> 02:00:02,840
Since the day you met her,
everyday has been chaotic.

2607
02:00:03,200 --> 02:00:03,680
Look...

2608
02:00:03,920 --> 02:00:05,480
if you wish her well,

2609
02:00:05,640 --> 02:00:07,480
never show up again.

2610
02:00:07,640 --> 02:00:08,000
Leave.

2611
02:00:10,400 --> 02:00:13,880
Also, let’s not tell her
that you gave her the blood.

2612
02:00:14,840 --> 02:00:16,400
We can’t be sure of
how she will react.

2613
02:00:16,760 --> 02:00:17,560
You can leave.

2614
02:00:18,760 --> 02:00:20,200
Why are you waiting?
Get out.

2615
02:00:27,520 --> 02:00:28,800
You didn’t go to see her?

2616
02:00:29,640 --> 02:00:31,120
Is this the end of the story?

2617
02:00:33,280 --> 02:00:34,040
Nope.

2618
02:00:35,280 --> 02:00:37,040
This is the beginning of a new story.

2619
02:00:37,480 --> 02:00:38,720
She came to see me.

2620
02:00:38,920 --> 02:00:39,640
What?

2621
02:00:40,800 --> 02:00:42,440
I was shocked too.

2622
02:00:50,440 --> 02:00:51,120
Excuse me.

2623
02:00:51,840 --> 02:00:53,560
This is Mano’s home right?

2624
02:00:56,480 --> 02:00:58,360
I think I’m at the wrong house.
Sorry.

2625
02:00:59,040 --> 02:00:59,840
Keerthana.

2626
02:01:06,400 --> 02:01:06,920
Hey Mano!

2627
02:01:07,120 --> 02:01:07,840
Hi.

2628
02:01:10,240 --> 02:01:11,800
You look startled.

2629
02:01:13,040 --> 02:01:13,880
How are you?

2630
02:01:14,280 --> 02:01:16,040
How do I appear?
I'm all fine now.

2631
02:01:17,200 --> 02:01:20,120
Should I return home or can I enter…

2632
02:01:20,360 --> 02:01:21,040
Please come in.

2633
02:01:23,040 --> 02:01:24,400
Lakshman uncle is not here.

2634
02:01:24,960 --> 02:01:25,640
Welcome!

2635
02:01:29,120 --> 02:01:29,800
Welcome!

2636
02:01:30,680 --> 02:01:31,800
Hey....

2637
02:01:36,520 --> 02:01:37,480
Don’t worry.

2638
02:01:37,680 --> 02:01:39,400
I’m not gonna fire your son.

2639
02:01:41,040 --> 02:01:42,200
You don't have to worry.

2640
02:01:42,360 --> 02:01:43,280
That’s my sister Divya.

2641
02:01:43,400 --> 02:01:44,480
Doing her facial.

2642
02:01:44,720 --> 02:01:46,200
But this is better.

2643
02:01:46,720 --> 02:01:47,560
Shut up.

2644
02:01:47,760 --> 02:01:48,400
Mom...

2645
02:01:48,960 --> 02:01:49,720
Please come in.

2646
02:01:50,040 --> 02:01:50,800
Have a seat.

2647
02:01:52,480 --> 02:01:52,960
Clown...

2648
02:01:54,920 --> 02:01:57,320
Excuse I’ll go wash my…

2649
02:01:58,000 --> 02:01:59,320
Don’t mind me, you can keep it on.

2650
02:01:59,880 --> 02:02:00,720
Thank you.

2651
02:02:01,280 --> 02:02:03,320
So, how are you feeling now?

2652
02:02:03,920 --> 02:02:05,840
Feeling much better, aunty.

2653
02:02:06,880 --> 02:02:08,840
Is it ok if I call you aunty?

2654
02:02:09,320 --> 02:02:11,320
No problem, your wish.

2655
02:02:11,800 --> 02:02:14,360
Aunty, I caused a lot of trouble
in your home last time.

2656
02:02:14,600 --> 02:02:16,200
Please forget it.

2657
02:02:16,400 --> 02:02:18,120
Why should we remember them?

2658
02:02:18,280 --> 02:02:19,640
Water under the bridge.

2659
02:02:19,840 --> 02:02:22,760
Mom and I wanted to see you in hospital.

2660
02:02:23,040 --> 02:02:25,760
But brother said let’s not disturb her.

2661
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:27,760
Oh, you could have come.
That’s not disturbance.

2662
02:02:27,960 --> 02:02:29,160
We have a guest here.

2663
02:02:29,360 --> 02:02:30,800
Go make some tea.

2664
02:02:33,840 --> 02:02:34,840
Unbelievable!

2665
02:02:35,400 --> 02:02:38,120
I made tea for the woman I love.
What’s your problem?

2666
02:02:38,480 --> 02:02:41,040
Let’s see how long this lasts.
- Will last forever.

2667
02:02:41,240 --> 02:02:41,800
Thank you.

2668
02:02:42,480 --> 02:02:43,600
Green tea.

2669
02:02:44,440 --> 02:02:45,600
Practicing.

2670
02:02:46,680 --> 02:02:49,240
Aunty, had it not been for your son.

2671
02:02:49,480 --> 02:02:50,840
I wouldn’t be here now.

2672
02:02:51,240 --> 02:02:53,200
That’s why I wanted to thank in person.

2673
02:02:53,600 --> 02:02:55,040
Mano thank you so much.

2674
02:02:55,360 --> 02:02:57,600
That’s unnecessary.

2675
02:02:57,960 --> 02:02:59,840
I’m sure anybody would have done it.

2676
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:00,640
Right ma?

2677
02:03:01,040 --> 02:03:04,560
Maybe they would have gotten an ambulance.

2678
02:03:05,120 --> 02:03:06,040
But you….

2679
02:03:06,520 --> 02:03:09,280
Carried me up and into the auto...

2680
02:03:09,920 --> 02:03:11,520
Your hands were trembling.

2681
02:03:11,840 --> 02:03:12,720
I knew.

2682
02:03:13,400 --> 02:03:14,840
Your shirt had blood all over it.

2683
02:03:15,600 --> 02:03:17,520
Memory is quite hazy.

2684
02:03:19,040 --> 02:03:20,440
I still get nightmares.

2685
02:03:21,600 --> 02:03:22,840
Thank you so much Mano.

2686
02:03:25,480 --> 02:03:28,040
When we heard of it, we were worried.

2687
02:03:28,640 --> 02:03:31,040
I can’t imagine it for your parents.

2688
02:03:33,560 --> 02:03:36,800
My parents passed when I was a kid.

2689
02:03:37,360 --> 02:03:39,840
My uncle and aunt raised me.

2690
02:03:40,280 --> 02:03:41,640
They are overseas now.

2691
02:03:41,920 --> 02:03:44,360
I was in boarding school my whole life.

2692
02:03:45,120 --> 02:03:47,960
Now I’m busy with my business.

2693
02:03:49,880 --> 02:03:52,040
For a woman, a single woman….

2694
02:03:52,800 --> 02:03:55,000
The heights you have achieved
are admirable!

2695
02:03:55,920 --> 02:03:58,280
Mano, my uncle wants to talk to you.

2696
02:03:58,440 --> 02:03:59,600
Do you have a couple of minutes?

2697
02:03:59,840 --> 02:04:01,600
2 minutes? I can spare an hour .

2698
02:04:01,760 --> 02:04:02,720
Please call him.

2699
02:04:04,160 --> 02:04:04,720
Please...

2700
02:04:07,320 --> 02:04:08,160
Hello, dad.

2701
02:04:08,560 --> 02:04:10,640
I’m at Mano’s house.

2702
02:04:10,960 --> 02:04:12,800
Would you like to speak to him?
Yes, please.

2703
02:04:16,320 --> 02:04:16,760
Hello.

2704
02:04:16,920 --> 02:04:17,920
How are you Mano?

2705
02:04:18,120 --> 02:04:19,600
You have saved my daughter.

2706
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:21,480
I don’t know how to thank you.

2707
02:04:21,600 --> 02:04:22,960
Just say thanks Sir.

2708
02:04:23,160 --> 02:04:24,720
No Mano, that won’t suffice.

2709
02:04:24,920 --> 02:04:27,280
I’ll book tickets to Paris for your whole family.
- How's the tea?

2710
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:28,920
I have to do something for you.

2711
02:04:29,240 --> 02:04:30,800
Your family is welcome.
- Sure Sir!

2712
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:31,840
It’s my strict order.

2713
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:33,560
I’ll return it to Keerthana.

2714
02:04:36,040 --> 02:04:36,480
Ma.

2715
02:04:37,040 --> 02:04:37,840
Bring everyone ...

2716
02:04:38,040 --> 02:04:39,640
He invited us all to Paris.

2717
02:04:40,720 --> 02:04:42,600
Is he in Parrys corner?

2718
02:04:43,400 --> 02:04:43,920
Aunty...

2719
02:04:44,680 --> 02:04:46,640
please Whatsapp your passport details.

2720
02:04:46,760 --> 02:04:47,760
I’ll get visas for you.

2721
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
Passport? For us?

2722
02:04:51,440 --> 02:04:52,920
We don’t have them.

2723
02:04:53,160 --> 02:04:57,480
He applied for passport
after 10th grade for God knows what.

2724
02:04:57,680 --> 02:04:59,920
Ok, then please allow Mano to go at least.

2725
02:05:00,160 --> 02:05:02,800
You still have your passport?

2726
02:05:02,960 --> 02:05:04,640
I have sent you my passport copy on Whatsapp.

2727
02:05:04,840 --> 02:05:05,880
You can process my visa.

2728
02:05:06,040 --> 02:05:07,360
Will help you buy tickets.

2729
02:05:07,760 --> 02:05:08,800
See you mom.

2730
02:05:09,560 --> 02:05:10,840
Sooner the better.
- Ok.

2731
02:05:10,960 --> 02:05:12,280
It’ll be a short trip.

2732
02:05:13,760 --> 02:05:14,280
Oh!

2733
02:05:15,920 --> 02:05:17,320
Aunty, a small gift for you.

2734
02:05:17,760 --> 02:05:19,000
Why take the trouble?

2735
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:21,000
Well played, mom.

2736
02:05:21,320 --> 02:05:22,320
This is for Divya.

2737
02:05:23,040 --> 02:05:24,280
For Divya?

2738
02:05:24,480 --> 02:05:26,400
Come out soon.
- Yes I’m coming.

2739
02:05:26,920 --> 02:05:27,520
Look...

2740
02:05:28,200 --> 02:05:28,800
Take this.

2741
02:05:28,960 --> 02:05:30,440
For you.
- Thank you.

2742
02:05:31,200 --> 02:05:32,160
Hey, don’t peep.

2743
02:05:33,200 --> 02:05:34,320
What happened?

2744
02:05:34,720 --> 02:05:35,480
Nothing.

2745
02:05:35,680 --> 02:05:36,760
Not a… thing.

2746
02:05:37,360 --> 02:05:38,040
Ok bye.

2747
02:05:38,320 --> 02:05:39,240
See you.

2748
02:05:39,760 --> 02:05:40,840
Goodbye, aunty.
- Bye.

2749
02:05:42,800 --> 02:05:44,680
Look at you.
- Ma, please.

2750
02:05:45,480 --> 02:05:45,800
Go.

2751
02:05:46,440 --> 02:05:47,000
(Singing)

2752
02:05:47,240 --> 02:05:49,360
What is he doing? Show me your gift.

2753
02:05:57,400 --> 02:05:57,840
Your….

2754
02:05:57,960 --> 02:05:59,200
I didn’t mistake you.

2755
02:05:59,320 --> 02:06:02,320
You have gotten them simple gifts.
You're gonna buy me costly gifts.

2756
02:06:02,760 --> 02:06:04,320
I’m not following you.

2757
02:06:05,200 --> 02:06:08,560
You gifted them but…

2758
02:06:08,920 --> 02:06:10,320
I wasn’t talking about it.

2759
02:06:10,960 --> 02:06:12,440
Then?

2760
02:06:12,720 --> 02:06:14,440
Your tea was very good.

2761
02:06:14,640 --> 02:06:15,920
I was waiting to tell you that.

2762
02:06:17,240 --> 02:06:17,760
Oh thanks!

2763
02:06:18,320 --> 02:06:20,960
Not just tea,
I make delicious Chicken Biryani.

2764
02:06:21,600 --> 02:06:25,400
My neighbor lady steals my Chicken Biryani.

2765
02:06:27,280 --> 02:06:30,840
My mother often says,
that my future wife is a lucky one.

2766
02:06:32,360 --> 02:06:33,920
Your mother got that right.

2767
02:06:35,040 --> 02:06:35,520
Bye.

2768
02:06:48,120 --> 02:06:50,920
Attention everyone, it's your Captain speaking.
We are taking off!

2769
02:06:57,640 --> 02:06:58,000
Hi.

2770
02:06:58,200 --> 02:06:58,760
Hi.

2771
02:06:59,440 --> 02:07:00,600
I want window seat.

2772
02:07:00,680 --> 02:07:01,720
Shall we exchange seat?

2773
02:07:02,160 --> 02:07:03,600
No, I can’t exchange.

2774
02:07:03,920 --> 02:07:06,680
Even I prefer window seat.

2775
02:07:08,160 --> 02:07:08,920
Why you vomit?

2776
02:07:10,280 --> 02:07:10,880
Sorry?

2777
02:07:11,160 --> 02:07:13,960
No, you put head outside the window
and vomit?

2778
02:07:14,320 --> 02:07:14,880
Like...

2779
02:07:16,520 --> 02:07:17,440
Nonsense.

2780
02:07:17,720 --> 02:07:18,880
What nonsense?

2781
02:07:19,160 --> 02:07:20,320
Sixth sense.

2782
02:07:20,480 --> 02:07:21,680
What’s happening Mano?

2783
02:07:23,680 --> 02:07:24,400
Please come.

2784
02:07:26,160 --> 02:07:28,960
I asked for the window seat,

2785
02:07:29,240 --> 02:07:30,560
she’s quite stubborn.

2786
02:07:30,800 --> 02:07:32,920
Oi, I’ll come and keep you.

2787
02:07:33,840 --> 02:07:34,360
Sorry?

2788
02:07:34,680 --> 02:07:35,920
I said I’ll get the seat back.

2789
02:07:37,760 --> 02:07:41,920
Booked tickets at the last moment,
they had only one Business Class seat.

2790
02:07:42,240 --> 02:07:43,560
Would you like to take that seat Mano?

2791
02:07:43,760 --> 02:07:44,520
I’ll manage here.

2792
02:07:44,760 --> 02:07:45,360
Oh, come on.

2793
02:07:45,600 --> 02:07:48,560
Flying in and of itself is a luxury to me.

2794
02:07:49,360 --> 02:07:51,720
Business class suits you better.

2795
02:07:52,120 --> 02:07:54,880
I’ll learn French from her.

2796
02:07:59,440 --> 02:08:00,320
Nice jacket.

2797
02:08:01,600 --> 02:08:02,320
Thanks.

2798
02:08:04,040 --> 02:08:05,320
Nice hairstyle.

2799
02:08:05,720 --> 02:08:06,760
Nice earring.

2800
02:08:06,960 --> 02:08:08,360
Nice lipstick.

2801
02:08:08,960 --> 02:08:10,280
Nice...

2802
02:08:10,560 --> 02:08:11,680
Nice dress.

2803
02:08:12,280 --> 02:08:14,240
Matching, matching….

2804
02:08:16,840 --> 02:08:17,440
Dora!

2805
02:08:19,920 --> 02:08:22,520
Just wanted to see if you respond to Dora.

2806
02:08:23,320 --> 02:08:24,520
Quite a strong response!

2807
02:08:25,160 --> 02:08:26,640
Can I call you Dora?

2808
02:08:40,760 --> 02:08:44,760
When she looks into my eyes,
A million miles my heart flies.

2809
02:08:45,120 --> 02:08:49,520
In her smile, lays a twist
lands a thousand pound fist.

2810
02:08:50,600 --> 02:08:54,360
Girl, don’t wink,
Makes my heart blink.

2811
02:08:54,960 --> 02:08:58,320
All this flutter, will make it weaker,
Aren't you eager?

2812
02:08:58,560 --> 02:09:02,600
Don’t look over so fast, slow down.

2813
02:09:02,840 --> 02:09:07,320
My heart is on the line, you’d mow down.

2814
02:09:07,480 --> 02:09:11,480
Every look is a new high,

2815
02:09:11,680 --> 02:09:16,000
So addictive, on the sly.

2816
02:09:16,720 --> 02:09:20,680
Girl, don’t wink,
Makes my heart blink.

2817
02:09:21,160 --> 02:09:24,920
Girl, don’t wink,
Makes my heart blink.

2818
02:09:42,200 --> 02:09:46,160
All the cars I upsell,
Dot the roads till Winterfell.

2819
02:09:46,320 --> 02:09:49,040
We’ll ride to our wedding bell!

2820
02:09:49,240 --> 02:09:50,200
Oh, yea!

2821
02:09:50,800 --> 02:09:54,920
I’m the biggest hustle,
Nothing stops me, don't hire a muscle.

2822
02:09:55,240 --> 02:09:57,560
The missives I send are heavy for a missile.

2823
02:09:57,840 --> 02:09:58,960
What’s up, girl?

2824
02:09:59,600 --> 02:10:03,240
Milk is all white and bright,

2825
02:10:03,680 --> 02:10:07,600
In a day, it goes expired.

2826
02:10:08,360 --> 02:10:12,280
Honey is all dark and brown,

2827
02:10:12,520 --> 02:10:16,800
Honey, I’m honey always unspoiled.

2828
02:10:17,120 --> 02:10:21,160
Don’t look over so fast, slow down.

2829
02:10:21,400 --> 02:10:25,440
My heart is on the line, you’d mow down.

2830
02:10:25,760 --> 02:10:29,920
Every look is a new high,

2831
02:10:30,200 --> 02:10:34,360
So addictive, on the sly.

2832
02:10:51,680 --> 02:10:55,920
Your smile,
launches me a mile.

2833
02:10:56,320 --> 02:11:00,360
That wretched ego,
Let us forego.

2834
02:11:00,680 --> 02:11:02,440
Tik tok is out of clock,

2835
02:11:02,560 --> 02:11:04,760
I’ll play a new Bach,

2836
02:11:05,040 --> 02:11:08,920
The concert will rock!

2837
02:11:09,320 --> 02:11:13,560
Let’s start dating,

2838
02:11:13,800 --> 02:11:17,720
Our selfies are winning.

2839
02:11:18,120 --> 02:11:26,480
When our eyes keep going wow,
It’s time to take the vow.

2840
02:11:26,800 --> 02:11:30,800
Don’t look over so fast, slow down.

2841
02:11:31,200 --> 02:11:35,240
My heart is on the line, you’d mow down.

2842
02:11:35,560 --> 02:11:39,800
Every look is a new high,

2843
02:11:40,040 --> 02:11:44,720
So addictive, on the sly.

2844
02:12:06,040 --> 02:12:06,480
Hello.

2845
02:12:06,880 --> 02:12:07,480
Hello.

2846
02:12:07,920 --> 02:12:08,560
Hi, aunty.

2847
02:12:09,120 --> 02:12:11,240
I want to tell you something.
Are you free now?

2848
02:12:11,440 --> 02:12:13,440
To me? Tell me aunty.

2849
02:12:14,160 --> 02:12:16,440
My son likes you very much.

2850
02:12:16,760 --> 02:12:19,520
Is in love with you.
Wishes to marry you.

2851
02:12:19,800 --> 02:12:21,920
I don’t know if this will ever happen.

2852
02:12:22,200 --> 02:12:24,560
I just felt like telling you.

2853
02:12:25,320 --> 02:12:27,240
Please don’t mistake me.

2854
02:12:28,240 --> 02:12:29,640
Definitely not, aunty.

2855
02:12:30,240 --> 02:12:31,920
Soon I’ll have a good news for you.

2856
02:12:32,120 --> 02:12:33,520
Tell me soon!

2857
02:12:34,400 --> 02:12:35,320
What’s that good news.

2858
02:12:35,520 --> 02:12:36,920
Hey, weren’t you sleeping?

2859
02:12:37,640 --> 02:12:39,560
Eyes only closed, ears always open.

2860
02:12:40,320 --> 02:12:42,920
Aunty and I have many things to discuss.
Why do you wanna know?

2861
02:12:43,560 --> 02:12:44,920
You are such a tease!

2862
02:12:56,800 --> 02:12:57,680
Where are you going?

2863
02:12:57,920 --> 02:12:58,800
To get our luggage.

2864
02:12:59,160 --> 02:13:00,720
Never mind, they will take care of it.

2865
02:13:00,920 --> 02:13:02,680
Our luggage is our responsibility.

2866
02:13:02,840 --> 02:13:03,720
The hotel is ours.

2867
02:13:03,880 --> 02:13:04,640
Ours?

2868
02:13:05,240 --> 02:13:05,760
Mine.

2869
02:13:06,360 --> 02:13:07,360
50 percent share.

2870
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:09,640
The other 50 percent?

2871
02:13:15,120 --> 02:13:15,560
Ashwin.

2872
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:17,320
Has another 8 such hotels.

2873
02:13:17,480 --> 02:13:19,000
One of the best hoteliers in Europe.

2874
02:13:19,320 --> 02:13:19,920
Oh!

2875
02:13:20,480 --> 02:13:21,480
Can I see him once more?

2876
02:13:22,920 --> 02:13:25,680
Yea, looks handsome!

2877
02:13:27,240 --> 02:13:28,480
Is everything okay, Roya?

2878
02:13:28,720 --> 02:13:29,240
Yes Mam.

2879
02:13:29,560 --> 02:13:30,880
- Excuse me, Roya.
- Yea.

2880
02:13:31,200 --> 02:13:32,960
I want two plates of Idiyappam with Paya.

2881
02:13:33,360 --> 02:13:34,240
Okay.

2882
02:13:36,560 --> 02:13:37,160
Mano...

2883
02:13:37,400 --> 02:13:38,960
I have something important
to tell you.

2884
02:13:39,280 --> 02:13:42,360
Your uncle and aunt are busy and will be late.
Right?

2885
02:13:42,560 --> 02:13:43,360
We have all day...

2886
02:13:43,760 --> 02:13:45,200
I was gonna say...
I love you.

2887
02:13:49,320 --> 02:13:50,920
I. Love. You.

2888
02:13:54,120 --> 02:13:54,760
Mano...

2889
02:13:55,080 --> 02:13:55,880
I have a wish.

2890
02:13:56,120 --> 02:14:00,600
After our marriage, I wanna quit the business.
Be a housewife.

2891
02:14:00,960 --> 02:14:02,480
I wanna cook for you.

2892
02:14:02,680 --> 02:14:04,640
Have a couple of cute babies, with you.

2893
02:14:04,920 --> 02:14:05,520
Also...

2894
02:14:05,920 --> 02:14:11,400
Wear the sarees you'd like, wear some flowers,
and visit temples with you on your bike.

2895
02:14:11,600 --> 02:14:14,280
Take care of your mother, you sister...
Tend to the family.

2896
02:14:14,640 --> 02:14:16,880
Get your sister married to a wealthy family.

2897
02:14:17,280 --> 02:14:18,520
After our wedding...

2898
02:14:18,760 --> 02:14:21,680
you should take care of all my
businesses and properties.

2899
02:14:22,880 --> 02:14:24,960
Will you do these for me, Mano?

2900
02:14:28,480 --> 02:14:33,160
Heard of being speechless,
but this is my first time experiencing it.

2901
02:14:34,480 --> 02:14:37,600
I can barely contain my happiness.
Imagine my mother listening to this!

2902
02:14:38,200 --> 02:14:40,760
Give me your phone.
We'll find out!

2903
02:14:41,080 --> 02:14:41,880
Go on, tell her.

2904
02:14:42,200 --> 02:14:43,880
This was her plan all along, anyways.

2905
02:14:44,080 --> 02:14:46,160
She'd be delighted to hear this.

2906
02:14:49,640 --> 02:14:50,760
What do you mean, Keerthana?

2907
02:14:51,040 --> 02:14:53,640
The plan is to get acquainted to a rich girl,

2908
02:14:53,760 --> 02:14:56,400
be friendly with her, earn her trust,

2909
02:14:56,560 --> 02:14:58,480
marry her and swindle...

2910
02:14:58,600 --> 02:15:00,600
what do you call it...
yea, flick all her money.

2911
02:15:00,800 --> 02:15:04,320
Move up the class stratum,
become high class for the next 5 generations,

2912
02:15:04,440 --> 02:15:05,960
who wouldn't have to work a day in their life!

2913
02:15:06,080 --> 02:15:07,880
This is your plan, right?

2914
02:15:08,720 --> 02:15:10,320
You are out of your mind, Keerthana.

2915
02:15:11,680 --> 02:15:12,960
I'm fully aware now.

2916
02:15:13,160 --> 02:15:14,240
I'm telling the facts.

2917
02:15:14,920 --> 02:15:17,080
You'd curse me to be "run-over"

2918
02:15:17,280 --> 02:15:20,280
the same day I'd get run over by a truck,
"saved" by your blood,

2919
02:15:20,360 --> 02:15:22,680
now I should fall in love
and marry you?

2920
02:15:22,920 --> 02:15:23,480
Wow!

2921
02:15:23,640 --> 02:15:25,800
What a sketch!
I'm quite impressed you know?

2922
02:15:28,040 --> 02:15:29,480
What are you looking at?

2923
02:15:30,040 --> 02:15:32,120
Heard of being petrified.

2924
02:15:32,400 --> 02:15:33,760
Watching it for the first time.

2925
02:15:34,080 --> 02:15:35,880
I know a few things about you.

2926
02:15:36,120 --> 02:15:37,680
You are quite frank.

2927
02:15:38,120 --> 02:15:41,960
So I was thinking about the man
behind this wicked plan, in the hospital.

2928
02:15:42,680 --> 02:15:44,040
When your mom called me,

2929
02:15:44,200 --> 02:15:45,440
it was obvious.

2930
02:15:46,120 --> 02:15:47,680
I have a doubt...

2931
02:15:48,560 --> 02:15:52,440
Why did your mother choose to be single,
given how well she plans?

2932
02:15:52,600 --> 02:15:56,040
Could have easily trapped and married a rich guy.

2933
02:15:59,080 --> 02:15:59,880
Roya!

2934
02:16:00,760 --> 02:16:01,880
Mam?
- Did you call the cops?

2935
02:16:02,160 --> 02:16:02,880
Yes.

2936
02:16:10,040 --> 02:16:11,800
Fill up the details, Roya.
- Sure, mam.

2937
02:16:13,600 --> 02:16:15,800
Didn't you say Ashwin is handsome?

2938
02:16:16,080 --> 02:16:17,400
Well, I'm gonna marry him.

2939
02:16:17,720 --> 02:16:19,040
I came here to meet him.

2940
02:16:19,440 --> 02:16:21,800
Did you think we are on a foreign tour?

2941
02:16:22,280 --> 02:16:26,440
If you wanna fool around,
be mindful of your level, status.

2942
02:16:26,760 --> 02:16:28,880
These are the consequences, otherwise.

2943
02:16:29,080 --> 02:16:30,880
This is a lesson for you, Mr Mano.

2944
02:16:31,320 --> 02:16:32,120
Officers...

2945
02:16:42,600 --> 02:16:43,880
(In Malayalam - Hey Mano!

2946
02:16:44,480 --> 02:16:46,080
Have you seen this country's prison?

2947
02:16:46,440 --> 02:16:47,640
It's very good!

2948
02:16:48,080 --> 02:16:49,640
Off you go, bye.)

2949
02:17:17,960 --> 02:17:18,920
Here's your passport.

2950
02:17:20,400 --> 02:17:21,480
This is your visa.

2951
02:17:22,080 --> 02:17:22,960
And ticket copy.

2952
02:17:23,720 --> 02:17:26,360
You have 24 hours,
to leave our country.

2953
02:17:27,480 --> 02:17:28,920
It's a sad ending to a story.

2954
02:17:29,280 --> 02:17:29,880
Manohar!

2955
02:17:30,120 --> 02:17:34,480
So by this time your girlfriend
is already meant to be married, right?

2956
02:17:35,880 --> 02:17:36,560
Yep.

2957
02:17:37,440 --> 02:17:38,360
Don't worry, bro.

2958
02:17:38,920 --> 02:17:41,760
If one Keerthana goes,
one Katherine will come.

2959
02:17:43,080 --> 02:17:43,640
Damn...

2960
02:17:44,040 --> 02:17:46,600
The state of me,
taking advice from the likes of you.

2961
02:17:46,680 --> 02:17:47,160
What?

2962
02:17:47,320 --> 02:17:50,480
Err... I'm trying to say "Thank you"
in my language

2963
02:17:51,480 --> 02:17:52,760
My pleasure bro.

2964
02:17:52,960 --> 02:17:54,280
See you. Take care.

2965
02:17:54,400 --> 02:17:54,960
Antony!

2966
02:17:55,280 --> 02:17:56,480
Huh?
- Is this your bike?

2967
02:17:56,760 --> 02:17:57,240
- Yea.

2968
02:17:57,520 --> 02:17:59,160
Can you give it to me for two hours please?

2969
02:17:59,280 --> 02:18:00,280
Where are you going?

2970
02:18:00,760 --> 02:18:03,680
I'm going to see my girlfriend and say...

2971
02:18:03,920 --> 02:18:04,760
... Goodbye.

2972
02:18:16,920 --> 02:18:18,400
Crap. Get the car.

2973
02:19:18,960 --> 02:19:23,760
Come baby, let's have a beer and talk.

2974
02:20:19,600 --> 02:20:23,920
You are being rude with your fiancé.
Aren't you ashamed?

2975
02:20:24,040 --> 02:20:24,760
Who are you?

2976
02:20:28,680 --> 02:20:30,440
I'm...
My name is Manohar.

2977
02:20:30,600 --> 02:20:33,280
No titles as yet.
Could use one when needed.

2978
02:20:33,560 --> 02:20:34,760
What do you want?

2979
02:20:39,120 --> 02:20:42,240
If Keerthana is in trouble,
I become so happy.

2980
02:20:42,600 --> 02:20:47,120
But I can't wait to know
what is her problem here.

2981
02:20:47,240 --> 02:20:49,120
Actually, I'm very excited you know!

2982
02:20:58,680 --> 02:20:59,760
Keerthu dear,

2983
02:21:00,080 --> 02:21:01,760
park this bike over please.

2984
02:21:06,560 --> 02:21:08,400
Remember, you started this.

2985
02:21:21,880 --> 02:21:23,320
Guys! Get him.

2986
02:22:08,560 --> 02:22:09,760
Keerthana madam!

2987
02:22:10,200 --> 02:22:14,760
You hyped up your fiancé.
Hotels in Paris, Private jets, Billions.

2988
02:22:15,920 --> 02:22:18,760
Here you are fooling around
in the middle of a road.

2989
02:22:20,120 --> 02:22:21,360
Is it a hobby?

2990
02:22:22,480 --> 02:22:23,720
Tell me baby.

2991
02:22:29,440 --> 02:22:30,040
Hi.

2992
02:22:30,720 --> 02:22:31,760
How are you?
- Fine.

2993
02:22:33,720 --> 02:22:34,360
Guys...

2994
02:22:37,600 --> 02:22:38,440
Keerthana...

2995
02:22:38,640 --> 02:22:39,960
You're looking so beautiful!

2996
02:22:40,200 --> 02:22:41,120
Thank you so much.

2997
02:22:41,280 --> 02:22:42,280
Do I look handsome?

2998
02:22:44,560 --> 02:22:44,960
Yea.

2999
02:22:45,240 --> 02:22:46,120
Thank you, thank you.

3000
02:22:46,280 --> 02:22:48,440
So how goes your theatre troupe?

3001
02:22:48,640 --> 02:22:51,960
Are you a travelling troupe
or do you have your own place?

3002
02:22:52,120 --> 02:22:52,760
Excuse me.

3003
02:22:53,640 --> 02:22:54,800
It's not a theatre troupe.

3004
02:22:55,040 --> 02:22:57,200
It's a television production house.
It's a corporate company.

3005
02:22:57,320 --> 02:22:59,040
And we are Number One in the industry. - Oh!

3006
02:22:59,240 --> 02:23:00,200
Corporate company!

3007
02:23:00,560 --> 02:23:01,440
Number One!

3008
02:23:02,360 --> 02:23:03,880
How much profits do you clock, annually?

3009
02:23:05,320 --> 02:23:07,200
About 500 Million Indian money.

3010
02:23:08,640 --> 02:23:11,680
You are so funny.

3011
02:23:13,320 --> 02:23:14,320
What did you say?

3012
02:23:15,200 --> 02:23:17,960
500 Million? Indian money? Annually?

3013
02:23:18,560 --> 02:23:20,440
That's my tab on a weekend party.

3014
02:23:20,600 --> 02:23:22,480
You call that a profit margin?
Peanuts.

3015
02:23:22,600 --> 02:23:23,240
Keerthana.

3016
02:23:23,440 --> 02:23:24,120
Do one thing...

3017
02:23:24,680 --> 02:23:27,600
After our wedding,
you wind down your threatre troupe. Ok?

3018
02:23:27,760 --> 02:23:28,200
Excuse me.

3019
02:23:28,320 --> 02:23:29,400
I told you it's not a...

3020
02:23:29,560 --> 02:23:32,040
- Yea, yea, whatever, whatever it is
I don't care.

3021
02:23:32,280 --> 02:23:35,600
My wife cannot be soap handler in a laundromat...

3022
02:23:35,720 --> 02:23:36,280
What?

3023
02:23:36,640 --> 02:23:37,480
Oh sorry.

3024
02:23:37,640 --> 02:23:42,960
I meant producer of Daily Soaps in TV,
would be an embarrassment for my status.

3025
02:23:43,160 --> 02:23:43,880
Excuse me.

3026
02:23:44,040 --> 02:23:46,960
Nobody has the right
to dictate my business.

3027
02:23:47,160 --> 02:23:49,880
Because it's my passion, my hard-work
and my self-respect.

3028
02:23:50,120 --> 02:23:51,960
Oh, she's such a Feminist.

3029
02:23:52,440 --> 02:23:53,960
And I hate Feminism.

3030
02:23:54,400 --> 02:23:56,760
Mr. Ashwin,
I don't think this is gonna work out.

3031
02:23:56,960 --> 02:23:58,760
I really need to leav...
- Hey, listen... listen

3032
02:23:59,160 --> 02:24:01,080
You're going to get married
to a rich guy like me.

3033
02:24:01,400 --> 02:24:03,080
Then why do you need this wretched troupe?

3034
02:24:03,200 --> 02:24:03,920
Hey!

3035
02:24:04,200 --> 02:24:07,960
Idiot, moron, imbecile, bonehead...
Don't you have sense?

3036
02:24:08,160 --> 02:24:10,280
How many times should I repeat that
this is a Production house.

3037
02:24:10,400 --> 02:24:11,320
What the hell!

3038
02:24:11,520 --> 02:24:12,960
How dare you talk to me like that?

3039
02:24:13,160 --> 02:24:14,360
Do you have any sense?

3040
02:24:14,520 --> 02:24:15,960
Is this how you behave with the girl...

3041
02:24:16,200 --> 02:24:17,600
Guy, you are gonna marry?

3042
02:24:17,760 --> 02:24:18,520
I hate you.

3043
02:24:18,680 --> 02:24:20,520
I hate you. I hate you. I hate you.

3044
02:24:20,600 --> 02:24:21,680
Get out of my life.

3045
02:24:23,040 --> 02:24:24,960
What are you staring at?
Out.

3046
02:24:26,600 --> 02:24:27,640
Idiot
- Oh God!

3047
02:24:28,640 --> 02:24:30,280
I'm...
I'm so sorry.

3048
02:24:31,400 --> 02:24:32,960
Just use this please.
Use this please.

3049
02:24:33,280 --> 02:24:34,440
Just leave me alone.
- Okay.

3050
02:24:34,560 --> 02:24:36,960
I'll show you the washroom.
Quite nearby. Come, come.

3051
02:24:38,040 --> 02:24:38,960
Hey!

3052
02:24:39,360 --> 02:24:40,160
What are you doing?

3053
02:24:42,560 --> 02:24:44,680
Oh! Force of habit.
You carry on.

3054
02:24:46,680 --> 02:24:49,120
Habit?
What's going on?

3055
02:24:51,360 --> 02:24:54,800
Excuse me.
What do you mean by "Force of Habit" ?

3056
02:24:56,040 --> 02:24:59,120
I wanted to surprise you
on our wedding night.

3057
02:25:00,400 --> 02:25:02,680
Now it's all ruined.
Gotta reveal it.

3058
02:25:03,440 --> 02:25:06,480
Till last year, I was a woman.

3059
02:25:06,920 --> 02:25:07,960
Named Ashwini.

3060
02:25:10,120 --> 02:25:14,120
Then I underwent a surgery
in Bangkok.

3061
02:25:14,880 --> 02:25:15,640
Now, Ashwin.

3062
02:25:16,400 --> 02:25:17,960
There's a slight snag.

3063
02:25:18,520 --> 02:25:20,440
Whenever I get emotional,

3064
02:25:21,240 --> 02:25:22,760
Ashwini's voice comes out.

3065
02:25:23,400 --> 02:25:24,960
It should be fine, soon.

3066
02:25:25,360 --> 02:25:26,640
What are you thinking?

3067
02:25:27,320 --> 02:25:31,240
If you doubt me,
spend the night with me.

3068
02:25:31,640 --> 02:25:33,360
And I'll show you the magic.

3069
02:25:35,080 --> 02:25:35,640
Move.

3070
02:25:49,320 --> 02:25:50,680
Keerthana madam!

3071
02:25:51,120 --> 02:25:53,920
Spent so much to teach me a lesson.

3072
02:25:54,160 --> 02:25:57,760
But looks like you spent
to learn, God's lesson.

3073
02:25:59,680 --> 02:26:03,760
My mom often says that,
if two girls are alone, they'd soon pick a fight.

3074
02:26:04,080 --> 02:26:06,200
She got that right, didn't she?

3075
02:26:06,360 --> 02:26:08,600
Picked a fight right
in the middle of the road.

3076
02:26:10,080 --> 02:26:12,880
Buying a foreign car is not a big deal, Keerthana.

3077
02:26:12,960 --> 02:26:16,320
Gotta check out if it is compatible to our roads.

3078
02:26:16,560 --> 02:26:18,240
Karma is a boomerang!

3079
02:26:19,040 --> 02:26:21,040
Let's hear your list of reasons, now.

3080
02:26:21,200 --> 02:26:21,960
Oh shut up!

3081
02:26:22,320 --> 02:26:22,720
Huh?

3082
02:26:24,440 --> 02:26:25,760
I didn't say anything.

3083
02:26:33,880 --> 02:26:36,200
I don't know what you think of me, Keerthana.

3084
02:26:36,880 --> 02:26:38,760
But I like you so, so much.

3085
02:26:39,880 --> 02:26:42,040
Your beauty, swagger, style, attitude...

3086
02:26:42,240 --> 02:26:43,760
All of it...
I love all of you.

3087
02:26:44,600 --> 02:26:47,480
I have admired this
every minute of us being together.

3088
02:26:48,160 --> 02:26:53,320
To see the woman I admire being harassed...
I'd have knocked him out...

3089
02:26:54,200 --> 02:26:55,880
spared him because he's your fiancé.

3090
02:26:56,640 --> 02:26:59,040
You know what my mom said to me?

3091
02:26:59,240 --> 02:27:02,400
"You don't have a father
but you have me and Divya."

3092
02:27:02,880 --> 02:27:04,760
"But Keerthana has nobody to call family."

3093
02:27:05,200 --> 02:27:06,760
"That's why she's so obtuse."

3094
02:27:07,760 --> 02:27:15,800
"If she got the same love you did, she'd be great.
Don't trouble her anymore."

3095
02:27:16,720 --> 02:27:18,720
Even I had the same thoughts coming here.

3096
02:27:19,040 --> 02:27:22,960
To hear you, think of us in such vulgarity...

3097
02:27:25,960 --> 02:27:27,760
It's a waste of time explaining to you.

3098
02:27:28,560 --> 02:27:30,640
When you go back to Chennai,

3099
02:27:30,800 --> 02:27:35,760
find a guy who matches "your level, your status",
marry him and be happy.

3100
02:27:37,960 --> 02:27:38,760
Bye Keerthana.

3101
02:27:40,280 --> 02:27:41,280
Keerthana,

3102
02:27:41,800 --> 02:27:43,920
let's keep this between us.

3103
02:27:44,960 --> 02:27:49,760
My mom admires you.
She speaks very highly of you.

3104
02:27:50,520 --> 02:27:53,120
She'd get hurt if she knows this.

3105
02:27:53,960 --> 02:27:55,760
Please don't pick up her calls.

3106
02:27:56,400 --> 02:28:00,760
Listen to me this one time, please...

3107
02:28:19,960 --> 02:28:22,360
Customer satisfaction has always been
our priority.

3108
02:28:22,560 --> 02:28:26,240
Sales Manager Ashok will explain
the Product Specs now.

3109
02:28:26,560 --> 02:28:27,440
Thank you.

3110
02:28:29,200 --> 02:28:30,600
Good Morning Ladies and Gentlemen.

3111
02:28:30,760 --> 02:28:31,560
I'm Ashok.

3112
02:28:31,880 --> 02:28:35,760
TATA Motors has launched a new model...

3113
02:28:44,680 --> 02:28:45,760
Hey, why are you here?

3114
02:28:45,960 --> 02:28:47,240
Mom, what happened?

3115
02:28:48,160 --> 02:28:49,760
Divya, speak up.
Why are you guys here?

3116
02:28:49,960 --> 02:28:51,800
Shut up. Don't you dare speak.
- Go, mom!

3117
02:28:52,040 --> 02:28:55,240
Are you even my son?
- Mom, why are you hitting me? People are watching...

3118
02:28:55,760 --> 02:28:58,040
What else do you expect?

3119
02:28:58,120 --> 02:29:00,160
Ma, what did I do?
- How can I say that?

3120
02:29:00,360 --> 02:29:03,080
Hey, tell him what he did.

3121
02:29:03,440 --> 02:29:06,880
You are ditching her,
after laying a hand on her in Paris.

3122
02:29:06,320 --> 02:29:07,480
Ditching?

3123
02:29:09,680 --> 02:29:12,040
Cross your heart, did you not lay on hand on me?

3124
02:29:12,120 --> 02:29:13,040
Oh Lord!

3125
02:29:14,240 --> 02:29:15,520
Yea I did. So?

3126
02:29:15,840 --> 02:29:19,760
(Clamour)

3127
02:29:19,960 --> 02:29:20,840
Aren't you ashamed?

3128
02:29:20,920 --> 02:29:22,280
What is there to be ashamed of?

3129
02:29:22,400 --> 02:29:24,960
Anybody would have did it in that situation.

3130
02:29:25,200 --> 02:29:26,280
What situation?

3131
02:29:26,520 --> 02:29:28,680
Shouldn't you have self-control as a man?

3132
02:29:28,920 --> 02:29:32,280
It is not possible...
- Shut up!

3133
02:29:32,400 --> 02:29:34,280
Listen to this Aunty!
-Yea, listen to her.

3134
02:29:34,960 --> 02:29:38,840
"Whatever happened in Paris,
shouldn't be known to my mom." He said.

3135
02:29:39,040 --> 02:29:39,840
Didn't you say it?
- Yep.

3136
02:29:39,960 --> 02:29:41,160
Oh my...

3137
02:29:41,880 --> 02:29:42,680
Shut up!

3138
02:29:45,400 --> 02:29:47,600
Ma, hear me out...
- Shut up!

3139
02:29:48,400 --> 02:29:49,640
She is my Daughter-in-law.

3140
02:29:49,840 --> 02:29:51,040
Oh no!
- Yes!

3141
02:29:51,120 --> 02:29:52,200
Not a word.

3142
02:29:52,480 --> 02:29:54,400
Bring her home with dignity.

3143
02:29:54,560 --> 02:29:56,680
Keep "Aarthi" (welcome ritual) ready.
-Who's Aarthi?

3144
02:29:56,920 --> 02:29:58,880
One more word and I swear...

3145
02:29:59,240 --> 02:30:00,720
(indiscernible)

3146
02:30:00,920 --> 02:30:01,880
Let's go
- Yea, mom.

3147
02:30:04,160 --> 02:30:04,920
Keerthana...

3148
02:30:05,400 --> 02:30:06,640
I read on the internet.

3149
02:30:07,040 --> 02:30:10,880
If you can say the date of the incident,
I'll refer Chinese calendar...

3150
02:30:11,120 --> 02:30:15,520
and let you know if the child is gonna be
boy or a girl.

3151
02:30:15,720 --> 02:30:18,480
I'll slap you.
Always with your Internet games. Get lost.

3152
02:30:18,600 --> 02:30:19,480
I'll call you, bye.

3153
02:30:19,640 --> 02:30:21,480
Boy or a girl...

3154
02:30:22,960 --> 02:30:23,680
Wait...

3155
02:30:24,200 --> 02:30:27,040
What did you mean by "laying a hand"?

3156
02:30:27,200 --> 02:30:28,680
Whatever you are thinking...

3157
02:30:28,880 --> 02:30:31,440
My Karma is a boomerang too!

3158
02:30:31,560 --> 02:30:33,280
Are you angry, honey?

3159
02:30:33,440 --> 02:30:35,840
Honey? I'll...

3160
02:30:36,360 --> 02:30:38,960
Calm down.
- Why are you doing this to me?

3161
02:30:40,240 --> 02:30:43,920
I apologized with your mom
and asked for your hand.

3162
02:30:44,120 --> 02:30:47,680
She said I have to consult my son, first.

3163
02:30:47,880 --> 02:30:48,920
Hence...

3164
02:30:51,040 --> 02:30:54,120
You said I'm not even worthy
of your rejection.

3165
02:30:54,320 --> 02:30:55,480
What now?

3166
02:30:55,760 --> 02:30:58,960
Are you planning to send my family to prison?

3167
02:30:59,560 --> 02:31:00,240
Speak up.

3168
02:31:02,080 --> 02:31:05,680
After our last meeting,
Divya called me.

3169
02:31:06,360 --> 02:31:07,840
She talked about "The Love Game".

3170
02:31:09,520 --> 02:31:10,440
Love game?

3171
02:31:11,120 --> 02:31:12,200
You are married.

3172
02:31:12,600 --> 02:31:15,120
You are expecting.
This is your ninth month.

3173
02:31:15,280 --> 02:31:18,800
You are in labor pains,
on your way to the labor ward.

3174
02:31:21,760 --> 02:31:23,560
You have an uncomplicated delivery.

3175
02:31:23,920 --> 02:31:28,120
When you regained consciousness,
nurse let you hold your baby.

3176
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:33,560
You were very happy looking at your child.

3177
02:31:35,040 --> 02:31:38,000
You badly wanted your husband
to see your child.

3178
02:31:38,320 --> 02:31:39,840
You were waiting for him.

3179
02:31:40,760 --> 02:31:42,800
You heard the door open,

3180
02:31:43,520 --> 02:31:45,000
looked reflexively at it.

3181
02:31:50,080 --> 02:31:52,800
Now tell us Keerthana,
who did you see as your husband?

3182
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:07,120
Not a chance.

3183
02:32:07,520 --> 02:32:08,320
Not. A. Chance.

3184
02:32:08,600 --> 02:32:10,040
I may have become your Dream Guy.

3185
02:32:10,320 --> 02:32:12,040
But you are not my Dream Girl now.

3186
02:32:12,720 --> 02:32:13,840
It's too late.

3187
02:32:15,720 --> 02:32:18,120
To accept someone on their
flattering side is quite common.

3188
02:32:18,800 --> 02:32:21,520
But to be accepting of flaws... That's quite rare.

3189
02:32:22,160 --> 02:32:23,560
So I wanna...

3190
02:32:24,560 --> 02:32:25,520
I understand.

3191
02:32:25,720 --> 02:32:29,240
Since you are pleading...
I'll consider it.

3192
02:32:29,760 --> 02:32:32,800
I'd take a room here, deliberate on the Pros and...

3193
02:32:39,400 --> 02:32:43,240
Ok, you have the final word.

3194
02:32:45,920 --> 02:32:47,160
Come here.
- Hello Keerthana.

3195
02:32:47,360 --> 02:32:49,840
Brother is not picking up.
Can you give the phone to him?

3196
02:32:50,320 --> 02:32:52,120
Your brother is busy.

3197
02:32:52,280 --> 02:32:54,360
It's an emergency.
Give it to him, please.

3198
02:32:55,160 --> 02:32:57,080
Your sister has something urgent to say.
- Hello.

3199
02:32:57,240 --> 02:32:58,480
Hello.
- Hello, bro!

3200
02:32:58,760 --> 02:33:00,000
I don't know you.
Wrong number.

3201
02:33:00,280 --> 02:33:02,920
This is unfair, bro.

3202
02:33:03,200 --> 02:33:07,840
As you instructed, I called Keerthana
at the right moment and played the Love Game.

3203
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:12,600
As promised, I want my motorcycle.
Or, I'll tell on you.

3204
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:16,960
Hello... are you there? Hello.

3205
02:33:17,320 --> 02:33:23,000
I know I'd be in your dreams...
Just tried to make you realize it.

3206
02:33:26,120 --> 02:33:27,560
Mr Manohar...

3207
02:33:29,360 --> 02:33:33,200
Your mum just beat the hell out of you.

3208
02:33:34,360 --> 02:33:38,000
Guess, it'll change after wedding.

3209
02:33:39,920 --> 02:33:41,760
Keerth... Keer...

3210
02:33:42,480 --> 02:33:45,080
They'd slip up a thousand times,
we should just forget it.

3211
02:33:45,360 --> 02:33:48,960
We'd slip up once and
never hear the end of it.

3212
02:33:50,360 --> 02:33:51,160
It's gonna be fun!

3213
02:33:51,320 --> 02:33:52,840
Mr. Local is ready to play husband!

3214
02:33:53,560 --> 02:33:54,600
Keerthana...

3215
02:33:54,760 --> 02:33:57,320
What's happening there?
- Nothing, dear.

3216
02:33:58,120 --> 02:33:58,480
Bye, bye.

3217
02:33:58,600 --> 02:34:00,360
Come here.
- On the way, dear.
