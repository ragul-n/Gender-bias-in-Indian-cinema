1
00:00:38,008 --> 00:00:40,341
You have to come whenever I call you.
Don't act smart.

2
00:00:40,466 --> 00:00:42,508
Am I acting smart?
- Where are we going?

3
00:00:42,633 --> 00:00:43,675
Where are we going, papa?

4
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,633
To visit your uncle.
- We can buy really nice clothes there.

5
00:00:45,758 --> 00:00:47,216
That's what everyone says.

6
00:00:47,466 --> 00:00:49,383
You can get more fashionable
clothes in Sarojini.

7
00:00:49,508 --> 00:00:50,925
Stop! - Bus!

8
00:00:55,341 --> 00:00:56,425
Hurry up, will you?

9
00:00:57,008 --> 00:00:59,550
Come, dear. We get down at this stop.
- Wait, auntie.

10
00:00:59,675 --> 00:01:00,675
Where do you want to go?

11
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,133
Just drive, uncle.
- We'll get down wherever we like.

12
00:01:04,966 --> 00:01:06,216
Sit down.

13
00:01:11,508 --> 00:01:14,508
So where are you getting off?

14
00:01:16,008 --> 00:01:19,050
Same place these
two will get off.

15
00:01:21,466 --> 00:01:22,508
Or just her!

16
00:01:22,633 --> 00:01:24,425
How dare you touch her!

17
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:26,008
Leave me. - Please.

18
00:01:26,591 --> 00:01:29,383
Damn you... Let me go! - You...

19
00:01:29,508 --> 00:01:32,175
Don't touch her. Let her go.
- What are you doing?

20
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,966
Let go of me. - Move.

21
00:01:34,091 --> 00:01:36,675
I'll kill you. - Damn you.

22
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,383
Sunny! - Shut your trap.

23
00:01:38,508 --> 00:01:39,800
Get her off the bus!

24
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,841
Sunny! - Beat him up.

25
00:01:41,966 --> 00:01:44,091
Priya, run.
- Where are you going? Don't let him go.

26
00:01:44,508 --> 00:01:47,175
Priya, run! Run!

27
00:01:47,716 --> 00:01:49,425
Catch her! - No!

28
00:01:50,008 --> 00:01:51,591
Catch her.

29
00:01:52,258 --> 00:01:53,133
Catch her.

30
00:01:53,258 --> 00:01:55,925
Stop! Stop!

31
00:02:02,633 --> 00:02:03,841
Where did she come from?

32
00:02:04,175 --> 00:02:06,883
Get out of the way, old hag!
Are you deaf or something?

33
00:02:07,175 --> 00:02:09,133
Are you crazy? Get lost.

34
00:02:09,799 --> 00:02:11,300
Old hag, move!

35
00:02:12,258 --> 00:02:14,966
Are you crazy?
- Didn't you hear me?

36
00:03:20,925 --> 00:03:23,550
August 1947.

37
00:03:24,758 --> 00:03:26,550
The last Viceroy of India

38
00:03:26,675 --> 00:03:28,966
Lord Mountbatten issued an order

39
00:03:29,216 --> 00:03:33,550
which endowed the British
officer, Sir Cyril Radcliffe

40
00:03:33,925 --> 00:03:37,800
with a vital responsibility
that demanded deftness.

41
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:43,425
Diving India into two parts.

42
00:03:45,383 --> 00:03:46,883
So Sir Radcliffe

43
00:03:47,133 --> 00:03:49,966
who had a little or no
idea of India's geography

44
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:54,133
and who couldn't differentiate
between North and South

45
00:03:54,758 --> 00:03:56,341
decided to simply rely
on the map of India.

46
00:03:57,008 --> 00:03:58,591
He drew two lines.

47
00:03:59,175 --> 00:04:01,300
One in Bengal and the
other in Punjab.

48
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:03,341
Within four weeks...

49
00:04:03,466 --> 00:04:05,341
Within just four weeks

50
00:04:06,425 --> 00:04:08,966
on the basis of his
amateurish knowledge,

51
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,341
divided the country
into two parts.

52
00:04:13,508 --> 00:04:16,258
India and Pakistan.

53
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:19,091
Everything was divided.

54
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:23,550
Farms, fields, lanes,
villages, cities, rivers.

55
00:04:23,883 --> 00:04:27,425
The Jhelum, the
Himalayas, Kutch, Thar,

56
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:30,966
animals, men, women, children, old.
Everyone.

57
00:04:31,675 --> 00:04:32,925
Everyone and everything
was divided.

58
00:04:33,383 --> 00:04:36,216
Sir Radcliffe's two
imaginary lines

59
00:04:37,175 --> 00:04:43,133
divided the heart and soul
of 14 million people.

60
00:04:45,466 --> 00:04:47,175
Millions became homeless.

61
00:04:48,175 --> 00:04:50,341
Thousands of innocents died.

62
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:53,008
And the coming generations

63
00:04:53,133 --> 00:04:57,591
were uprooted by
the Radcliff Line.

64
00:05:04,133 --> 00:05:06,216
It's the story of a house

65
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:11,466
through which ran
the partition line

66
00:05:11,883 --> 00:05:14,425
severing its very head,

67
00:05:15,466 --> 00:05:17,091
but failed to divide it.

68
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,425
From the Bundelas and Harbolas

69
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,216
we heard her glorious tales.

70
00:05:22,758 --> 00:05:26,216
One who fought bravely, that
was the Queen of Jhansi.

71
00:05:27,175 --> 00:05:28,425
Did you understand
anything, Laadli?

72
00:05:29,008 --> 00:05:30,883
After the king's demise,

73
00:05:31,008 --> 00:05:35,258
the Queen did not hide behind
her veil and shed tears.

74
00:05:35,966 --> 00:05:40,466
Despite all the deceit and
treachery by the men of her court,

75
00:05:40,925 --> 00:05:42,091
the Queen stood her ground.

76
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:43,216
She did not deter.

77
00:05:43,591 --> 00:05:47,675
Well, she already knew how to
ride a horse, wield a sword.

78
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,758
But when things got
out of control

79
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:51,883
she was determined to
raise her own army.

80
00:05:52,383 --> 00:05:54,925
With the flag soaring
high, and brave-heartedly

81
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:57,300
she challenged the
enemy head on.

82
00:05:57,425 --> 00:05:59,758
She took on her enemies...
- Now that's a staunch woman.

83
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,883
Along the way, she created a new history.
Lakshmibai.

84
00:06:04,133 --> 00:06:07,008
Who, in order to save
her kingdom of Jhansi

85
00:06:07,466 --> 00:06:09,050
made the British
for their lives.

86
00:06:09,508 --> 00:06:10,800
With a sword in one hand

87
00:06:10,925 --> 00:06:14,425
and her son tied to her back...
- Did Queen Lakshmibai have a son too?

88
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,966
Yes, it wasn't her own blood.

89
00:06:17,216 --> 00:06:19,008
Maybe he was adopted.

90
00:06:19,341 --> 00:06:21,050
Then whose daughter am I?

91
00:06:21,175 --> 00:06:24,091
This wretch has no
dearth of questions.

92
00:06:24,216 --> 00:06:25,591
Laali!
- I won't tell you any stories.

93
00:06:25,716 --> 00:06:28,300
Go and study... - Laali.

94
00:06:28,425 --> 00:06:30,008
I won't tell you anything.
- This girl...

95
00:06:30,258 --> 00:06:31,175
Laadli. - Chatterbox.

96
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,466
Will you take a bath or should
I throw you into the well?

97
00:06:33,758 --> 00:06:36,258
Begum Jaan wants to
see you, auntie.

98
00:06:36,383 --> 00:06:39,341
Sure. If Begum Jaan's
calling me, then I must go.

99
00:06:58,341 --> 00:06:59,550
Go away!

100
00:06:59,883 --> 00:07:01,758
What's wrong, you slut?
Are you nuts?

101
00:07:01,883 --> 00:07:04,050
You old pervert!

102
00:07:04,175 --> 00:07:07,091
I've warned you so many times
not to touch my breasts!

103
00:07:07,216 --> 00:07:08,508
Don't you get it?

104
00:07:08,633 --> 00:07:10,133
Get lost from here!

105
00:07:10,258 --> 00:07:12,258
If I see you here again,

106
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:15,466
I'll slice it into
little pieces.

107
00:07:15,591 --> 00:07:16,633
Shut up. - Get lost!

108
00:07:16,758 --> 00:07:17,925
Gulabo. - Crazy bitch.

109
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:19,841
You're making quite a racket
early in the morning.

110
00:07:20,341 --> 00:07:22,883
Just get on with it. Begum
Jaan wants to see you.

111
00:07:26,925 --> 00:07:29,716
Begum Jaan, she was raped
in the past riots.

112
00:07:30,925 --> 00:07:33,633
Some boys dumped her at the
camp in a pitiful state.

113
00:07:34,216 --> 00:07:37,758
Her father refused to take
her in and left her here.

114
00:07:40,633 --> 00:07:44,008
Father, brother, son, husband.

115
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:48,633
On the other side of
Begum Jaan's threshold,

116
00:07:50,716 --> 00:07:53,091
every man is a motherfucker.

117
00:07:54,175 --> 00:07:58,633
But on this side,
every man is a goose.

118
00:07:59,466 --> 00:08:01,258
A goose with three legs.

119
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:06,175
I am sure, your father must
have given you a name.

120
00:08:16,883 --> 00:08:19,216
Fine. I'll give you one then.

121
00:08:23,258 --> 00:08:25,258
Her cheeks are still
red like apples.

122
00:08:25,383 --> 00:08:27,508
I guess she's from Kashmir.
- Yes.

123
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:33,216
Well then, your name is Shabnam.

124
00:08:35,383 --> 00:08:36,508
Pet name. Shabbo.

125
00:08:38,008 --> 00:08:39,383
Will you remember?

126
00:08:41,508 --> 00:08:44,341
Auntie, take her in.

127
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:47,925
Bathe her, clean her, feed her.

128
00:08:48,758 --> 00:08:51,050
Sujeet. - Yes, ma'am.

129
00:08:51,175 --> 00:08:55,591
Get some clothes for
her from the market.

130
00:08:55,841 --> 00:08:56,675
Rubina.

131
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,841
Yes. - Come on.

132
00:08:57,966 --> 00:08:59,675
Jamila, Lata.

133
00:09:00,675 --> 00:09:03,341
Three of you should take care of her.
- Come, dear.

134
00:09:03,466 --> 00:09:04,633
Teach her.

135
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:07,966
Salim, if anyone ever
comes looking for her

136
00:09:08,091 --> 00:09:10,383
any relative or someone
from the police station,

137
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:13,800
just tell them that Begum
Jaan has given her refuge.

138
00:09:14,091 --> 00:09:15,133
Search over.

139
00:09:15,258 --> 00:09:16,216
Okay.

140
00:09:17,716 --> 00:09:20,133
Wait! Come here!

141
00:09:24,966 --> 00:09:26,425
Harder, Rubina.

142
00:09:33,758 --> 00:09:37,216
My child, it's paining
a lot, isn't it?

143
00:09:41,341 --> 00:09:43,300
You're in a shock.

144
00:09:44,966 --> 00:09:46,841
They were really
cruel, weren't they?

145
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,133
They did a terrible thing.

146
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,425
Even your father disowned you.

147
00:10:30,883 --> 00:10:32,341
Finally, it's all out.

148
00:10:36,591 --> 00:10:38,800
Otherwise, your pain
would've never healed.

149
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,716
Life will be easier now.

150
00:11:18,216 --> 00:11:24,675
"I fell so deeply
in love with you."

151
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:31,425
"The old memories were
refreshed again."

152
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,841
"What has happened?"

153
00:11:35,341 --> 00:11:38,300
"When did I hold my breath"

154
00:11:38,758 --> 00:11:41,800
"and when did I let go?"

155
00:11:42,216 --> 00:11:48,550
"Every pain was conveyed."

156
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:52,050
"What has happened?"

157
00:11:52,425 --> 00:11:56,466
"I fell so deeply..."

158
00:12:16,716 --> 00:12:22,883
"The beautiful Awadh evenings
reflects in my eyes."

159
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:29,675
"My lips are red as the
morning of Benares."

160
00:12:30,091 --> 00:12:36,591
"The waters of the Jhelum
trickle down my hair."

161
00:12:37,008 --> 00:12:43,758
"I've been wandering from
one shore to another"

162
00:12:43,883 --> 00:12:50,633
"that I've lost my own abode."

163
00:12:50,758 --> 00:12:53,716
"What has happened?"

164
00:12:54,216 --> 00:12:57,841
"I fell so deeply..."

165
00:13:11,175 --> 00:13:17,883
"Watching you from
shadows is painful."

166
00:13:18,008 --> 00:13:24,800
"Don't wish to die in
shadows, away from you."

167
00:13:24,925 --> 00:13:31,175
"You sneak up to my doorstep."

168
00:13:31,675 --> 00:13:37,758
"My heart bleeds and my
heartbeat full of desolation."

169
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:44,925
"My heart bleeds and my
heartbeat full of desolation."

170
00:13:45,383 --> 00:13:51,758
"I dabbed soothing
turmeric on your wounds"

171
00:13:52,258 --> 00:13:58,675
"and opened up my
wounds along the way."

172
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:02,133
"What has happened?"

173
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:08,966
"I feel deeply in
love with you."

174
00:14:09,425 --> 00:14:15,800
"The old memories were
refreshed again."

175
00:14:16,133 --> 00:14:19,550
"What has happened?"

176
00:14:19,675 --> 00:14:24,216
"I fell so deeply..."

177
00:14:37,466 --> 00:14:39,591
Sir, we went to Sakkargarh
Police Station.

178
00:14:40,091 --> 00:14:42,550
But they said it's outside
their jurisdiction.

179
00:14:42,675 --> 00:14:44,216
So they can't do anything.

180
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:46,466
Please... - What can I do?

181
00:14:47,633 --> 00:14:49,550
It doesn't come under our
jurisdiction either.

182
00:14:49,675 --> 00:14:50,758
It's outside the city limits.

183
00:14:51,008 --> 00:14:53,091
The boys are growing up, sir.

184
00:14:53,383 --> 00:14:55,508
It's getting harder to keep
them under restraints.

185
00:14:55,633 --> 00:14:59,383
You see, even my
daughter is growing up.

186
00:14:59,758 --> 00:15:02,508
Just last month, she completed 10 years.
- Yes.

187
00:15:02,966 --> 00:15:04,175
Right. - But I know

188
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,341
the responsibility of a father.

189
00:15:06,716 --> 00:15:10,841
So I keep her away
from this filth.

190
00:15:10,966 --> 00:15:12,216
But sir, that's not
the real problem.

191
00:15:12,341 --> 00:15:15,758
Those prostitutes! They
roam around freely.

192
00:15:15,883 --> 00:15:18,508
It's difficult to even pass
through that route now.

193
00:15:18,633 --> 00:15:21,383
They drink, they smoke.

194
00:15:22,008 --> 00:15:24,550
They hurl abuses at anyone.
- What did you think?

195
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,383
Prostitutes are
religious people.

196
00:15:26,633 --> 00:15:28,175
That's not what I meant, sir.

197
00:15:28,425 --> 00:15:30,258
But you know

198
00:15:30,716 --> 00:15:33,383
they are spreading diseases.
- Tell me one thing.

199
00:15:33,675 --> 00:15:38,716
Where were you last
Saturday at around 9:30 pm?

200
00:15:39,008 --> 00:15:40,133
Well, I...

201
00:15:41,675 --> 00:15:42,758
I...

202
00:15:42,883 --> 00:15:47,258
Once a guy said to
Mullah Naseeruddin:

203
00:15:48,383 --> 00:15:51,883
"My son eats a lot of sugar.
What should we do?"

204
00:15:52,425 --> 00:15:54,716
The Mullah replied: "Come
back after a week."

205
00:15:55,633 --> 00:15:57,925
"First, I must stop
eating sugar."

206
00:16:00,716 --> 00:16:02,925
What? What are you
trying to say, sir?

207
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:06,216
I don't...
- First, you must stop eating sugar

208
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:09,966
and then stop your sons. Huh!

209
00:16:23,633 --> 00:16:26,341
If any rascal lays a finger
on these innocent people

210
00:16:26,466 --> 00:16:29,008
then Salim Mirza will turn
this place into their graves.

211
00:16:29,133 --> 00:16:31,383
Bloody animals! You call
yourselves Muslims!

212
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:52,258
I have no words to describe, dear.
The battle was so fierce.

213
00:16:52,383 --> 00:16:54,925
But Salim Mirza
refused to budge.

214
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:57,008
Mirza didn't rest until all
the protestors were subdued

215
00:16:57,133 --> 00:17:01,925
and the Hindus were safely
transported to the camps.

216
00:17:02,716 --> 00:17:03,633
But...

217
00:17:03,758 --> 00:17:05,466
Dear! There is a camp
of lice in your hair.

218
00:17:06,633 --> 00:17:08,383
And what did he get in return?

219
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,966
Torn shoes! Humiliation!

220
00:17:12,424 --> 00:17:15,799
The rascal was also fired
from the police department.

221
00:17:16,174 --> 00:17:17,841
Since then Salim's
been living here.

222
00:17:18,258 --> 00:17:22,174
Auntie, is killing Hindus
same as killing Muslims?

223
00:17:26,049 --> 00:17:27,591
So the question is

224
00:17:28,008 --> 00:17:29,966
is it going to happen or not?

225
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,550
You've lost your mind.

226
00:17:32,883 --> 00:17:34,716
The question is when?

227
00:17:34,841 --> 00:17:36,841
It's just a rumor.

228
00:17:37,508 --> 00:17:39,175
They will erect few poles

229
00:17:39,466 --> 00:17:41,008
and then put up a boundary.

230
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:44,175
Then they will take
the weekend off.

231
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,800
Everything will be back
to normal after that.

232
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:49,966
I am telling you, Panditji
will never let this happen.

233
00:17:50,091 --> 00:17:51,925
Panditji. Panditji. Panditji.

234
00:17:52,758 --> 00:17:55,050
Is he handling the entire
politics of the country?

235
00:17:55,175 --> 00:17:58,258
There's Jinnah, Mr.
Singh, Sardar.

236
00:17:58,383 --> 00:17:59,550
Gandhiji too.

237
00:18:00,383 --> 00:18:03,550
There's you, me, this Baliya.

238
00:18:04,966 --> 00:18:05,966
Together...

239
00:18:06,925 --> 00:18:08,383
We won't let anything happen.

240
00:18:09,091 --> 00:18:10,133
Understand?

241
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,133
The British took advantage
of our naiveté.

242
00:18:14,133 --> 00:18:15,425
200 years.

243
00:18:15,841 --> 00:18:20,800
Long years ago, we made
a tryst with destiny.

244
00:18:22,008 --> 00:18:23,258
What is he saying? - And now...

245
00:18:23,383 --> 00:18:27,300
that time comes when we
shall redeem our pledge.

246
00:18:27,841 --> 00:18:29,633
What's he saying?
- Not wholly...

247
00:18:29,925 --> 00:18:33,883
or in full measure, but
very substantially.

248
00:18:35,841 --> 00:18:39,966
At the stroke of the midnight
hour, when the world sleeps,

249
00:18:40,091 --> 00:18:40,966
I don't know.

250
00:18:41,091 --> 00:18:43,550
India will awake to
life and freedom.

251
00:18:43,675 --> 00:18:44,925
Freedom!

252
00:18:45,258 --> 00:18:48,050
Freedom! Congratulations!

253
00:18:48,175 --> 00:18:49,425
What's the matter?

254
00:18:50,091 --> 00:18:53,675
Freedom!

255
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,966
We're free. We're free.

256
00:18:57,341 --> 00:18:59,050
Freedom!

257
00:19:14,508 --> 00:19:16,258
Stay back. Stay back.

258
00:19:16,383 --> 00:19:18,300
Auntie, please keep
an eye on her.

259
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,508
She has got sparkler
in her hand.

260
00:19:21,633 --> 00:19:23,175
Careful, auntie.

261
00:19:31,258 --> 00:19:32,925
Laadli, move.

262
00:19:33,258 --> 00:19:35,175
It looks so nice, isn't it?

263
00:19:38,716 --> 00:19:40,716
Everyone will get it. Here.

264
00:19:40,841 --> 00:19:42,758
Careful. Laadli...

265
00:19:43,091 --> 00:19:44,383
For Laadli.

266
00:19:45,758 --> 00:19:47,300
Come on, teacher.

267
00:19:47,758 --> 00:19:49,841
She hasn't even finished reading
the last book you gave her.

268
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,091
What was it?

269
00:19:51,216 --> 00:19:52,883
Veer... - Veerangana.

270
00:19:53,008 --> 00:19:54,383
Yes, Veerangana.

271
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:57,258
And then these sweets,
firecrackers.

272
00:19:57,383 --> 00:19:59,008
Why do you spend
so much, teacher?

273
00:19:59,133 --> 00:20:01,300
We have a separate
fund for social work.

274
00:20:01,425 --> 00:20:04,425
You really think I can afford
all this with my tuition fee.

275
00:20:06,216 --> 00:20:08,675
I thought your pocket
is like your heart.

276
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,716
Big.

277
00:20:12,425 --> 00:20:14,050
Begum Jaan, our country has
achieved independence today.

278
00:20:14,175 --> 00:20:15,466
Won't you celebrate?

279
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:18,675
Independence is only for men.

280
00:20:19,425 --> 00:20:21,341
Women don't even have
the freedom to abuse.

281
00:20:21,466 --> 00:20:23,841
How can we hurl abuses at
our mother and sisters?

282
00:20:24,591 --> 00:20:26,258
You've very naïve, teacher.

283
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:30,050
Should a prostitute celebrate on
a day when she has a customer

284
00:20:30,466 --> 00:20:32,133
or on the day she
doesn't have even one?

285
00:20:32,258 --> 00:20:33,966
So you're not happy
with the independence.

286
00:20:34,091 --> 00:20:36,133
Independence is just nonsense.

287
00:20:36,258 --> 00:20:37,841
Holidays are very
bad for business.

288
00:20:37,966 --> 00:20:39,841
We didn't have a single
customer since morning.

289
00:20:40,508 --> 00:20:43,133
Respected and rich people spend
this day with their family.

290
00:20:43,258 --> 00:20:44,925
Why will they show
up at the brothel?

291
00:20:45,425 --> 00:20:47,091
And even if someone shows up

292
00:20:47,383 --> 00:20:51,091
it's one of those drunk labors.
Those who puke on the bed.

293
00:20:52,341 --> 00:20:54,841
And let's not even count
those freaking cops.

294
00:20:54,966 --> 00:20:57,216
They are just...
- You don't get it, Begum Jaan.

295
00:20:57,716 --> 00:20:58,883
We've achieved freedom

296
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:01,466
after 200 years of
slavery to the British.

297
00:21:01,966 --> 00:21:05,300
For a prostitute, all
days are same, teacher.

298
00:21:05,591 --> 00:21:07,883
Once the lights are
off, men are just men.

299
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:10,466
Hindu, Muslim,
Brahmin, untouchables.

300
00:21:10,591 --> 00:21:12,008
They all are same
when lights are off.

301
00:21:12,925 --> 00:21:14,216
This brothel

302
00:21:14,758 --> 00:21:16,466
is like a nation.

303
00:21:16,591 --> 00:21:17,425
And freedom...

304
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:20,008
You wretch, stay away
from the firecracker!

305
00:21:20,758 --> 00:21:21,925
Careful, dear.

306
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:22,966
If you burn your face

307
00:21:23,091 --> 00:21:25,258
you'll be wandering
around like a bitch!

308
00:21:25,383 --> 00:21:27,466
No one will buy you, nor
will I let you stay here.

309
00:21:27,591 --> 00:21:29,341
I will kick you out! - Listen...

310
00:21:29,466 --> 00:21:32,800
Oh come on. They are celebrating
independence today.

311
00:21:32,925 --> 00:21:36,133
Please don't interfere.
You've spoilt them!

312
00:21:36,258 --> 00:21:37,341
Hey.

313
00:21:37,466 --> 00:21:38,758
She's so short-tempered.

314
00:21:38,883 --> 00:21:40,591
Bloody... - Why?

315
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,466
There are no
short-tempered Gujaratis?

316
00:21:42,591 --> 00:21:44,633
Begum Jaan, let's not
be indifferent here.

317
00:21:44,758 --> 00:21:46,425
We're all the same here.

318
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:47,925
We're all whores.

319
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:50,591
Shut up!
- Rubina, take care of these girls.

320
00:21:50,716 --> 00:21:53,425
Damn them... I'll
teach them a lesson.

321
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,883
Teacher, you better leave now

322
00:21:55,258 --> 00:21:57,883
and don't bring any more gifts.

323
00:21:58,008 --> 00:22:00,466
You see, Begun Jaan
never takes any favors.

324
00:22:00,716 --> 00:22:02,633
She always repays her debts.
If we're short of money

325
00:22:02,758 --> 00:22:05,675
we'll offer you one of the girls...
- Stop blurting nonsense.

326
00:22:06,008 --> 00:22:07,925
I come here for the country...

327
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:10,466
What about sisters and mothers
of our glorious nation?

328
00:22:11,216 --> 00:22:13,300
Hindu, Muslim, foreigners.
Whoever they are.

329
00:22:13,425 --> 00:22:14,716
It will always be a man's thing.

330
00:22:14,841 --> 00:22:16,758
So what do we care...
- It's your country, too.

331
00:22:16,883 --> 00:22:17,925
Fine, then go ahead.

332
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:21,341
Ask any man out of the
millions of citizens

333
00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:25,050
to marry one of the women
and take her away.

334
00:22:25,175 --> 00:22:26,091
Tell me.

335
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,050
I was just...
- Don't do it, teacher.

336
00:22:29,175 --> 00:22:31,050
Don't make tall claims.

337
00:22:31,175 --> 00:22:33,050
Give it to me.

338
00:22:38,425 --> 00:22:40,591
Give it to me...

339
00:22:40,716 --> 00:22:44,716
Begum Jaan says that
not only our bodies

340
00:22:45,341 --> 00:22:47,841
even our hearts have a price.

341
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:49,758
Teacher.

342
00:22:50,883 --> 00:22:54,008
A little more than these
sweetmeats and firecrackers.

343
00:22:55,133 --> 00:22:59,383
Perhaps, I'll adjust
for your sake.

344
00:23:00,258 --> 00:23:01,341
Only for heart.

345
00:23:01,466 --> 00:23:05,091
Begum Jaan is right.
Everything has a price.

346
00:23:05,633 --> 00:23:09,841
Body, soul and land.

347
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:15,050
Panditji, Sardar sir,
Balwant Singh, Jinnah

348
00:23:15,175 --> 00:23:17,341
Liaqat Khan. Everyone
gave their approval.

349
00:23:17,466 --> 00:23:19,300
Who cares whether they
approve of it or not.

350
00:23:19,425 --> 00:23:21,300
This country is ours. - Was!

351
00:23:21,841 --> 00:23:23,841
Now they will draw a
line across Punjab.

352
00:23:24,133 --> 00:23:27,300
This side will be India and on
that side will be Pakistan.

353
00:23:27,425 --> 00:23:29,841
And a line is drawn by the
foreigners in the middle.

354
00:23:29,966 --> 00:23:30,925
Radcliffe.

355
00:23:31,425 --> 00:23:32,591
The Radcliffe line.

356
00:23:32,925 --> 00:23:37,508
"My beloved..."

357
00:23:40,175 --> 00:23:44,425
"I'm leaving them..."

358
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:48,841
The boundary line follows the western
boundary of Pathankot district

359
00:23:48,966 --> 00:23:51,341
to the point where
Pathankot, Sakkargarh

360
00:23:51,466 --> 00:23:53,591
and Gurdaspur districts meet.

361
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:57,591
Then it follows the
boundary between Sakkargarh

362
00:23:57,716 --> 00:24:02,716
and Gurdaspur districts, between
Batla and the Roval districts

363
00:24:03,716 --> 00:24:06,841
between Ansnala and
Sardara districts.

364
00:24:07,758 --> 00:24:09,633
To the point on the river Ravi,

365
00:24:09,758 --> 00:24:12,758
where the districts of
Lahore and Amritsar meet.

366
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:19,300
Sir, Mr. Ilias is here.

367
00:24:20,925 --> 00:24:25,216
"My beloved..."

368
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:29,091
Here I am.

369
00:24:34,425 --> 00:24:35,300
Why?

370
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:38,466
Did I say something wrong?

371
00:24:41,758 --> 00:24:42,966
How is your mom?

372
00:24:44,591 --> 00:24:45,675
Is Kusum all right?

373
00:24:46,966 --> 00:24:48,050
Yes, she is.

374
00:24:49,008 --> 00:24:50,800
She barely escaped
getting raped.

375
00:24:52,341 --> 00:24:55,050
I don't know whether
mother got raped or not.

376
00:24:55,341 --> 00:24:57,841
She doesn't say anything.
Just keeps crying.

377
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:10,633
Sit.

378
00:25:17,091 --> 00:25:18,133
How is your wife?

379
00:25:22,216 --> 00:25:23,591
She was stripped.

380
00:25:26,966 --> 00:25:27,883
They killed her.

381
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,300
Then burned her.

382
00:25:40,591 --> 00:25:41,758
I didn't know.

383
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:44,966
I mean... I am
really very sorry.

384
00:25:45,591 --> 00:25:47,008
What if you had known?

385
00:25:47,841 --> 00:25:49,633
What if you had been around?

386
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:54,341
It happened right
before my eyes.

387
00:25:55,383 --> 00:25:56,300
Everything.

388
00:25:56,883 --> 00:25:58,466
That night, when they...
- Betel leaf.

389
00:26:00,341 --> 00:26:01,841
Do you still chew betel leaf?

390
00:26:04,258 --> 00:26:05,341
I stopped that long ago.

391
00:26:06,675 --> 00:26:10,341
And you... do you
still eat beef?

392
00:26:13,258 --> 00:26:15,091
We would specially
prepare it for you.

393
00:26:15,383 --> 00:26:16,591
Kebabs, beef.

394
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,550
You hated colors.

395
00:26:22,175 --> 00:26:24,383
We would celebrate 'Holi'.
- Ilias.

396
00:26:25,591 --> 00:26:28,508
There's no point in remembering...
- Yes, we're enemies, after all.

397
00:26:29,383 --> 00:26:31,050
We hate each other.

398
00:26:34,508 --> 00:26:35,508
Don't worry.

399
00:26:37,091 --> 00:26:40,091
No one will know that
we're childhood friends.

400
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,675
Okay?

401
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,675
Yes.

402
00:26:43,841 --> 00:26:46,758
We represent the Indian National
Congress and Muslim League.

403
00:26:47,383 --> 00:26:48,883
We're here on official business.

404
00:26:49,008 --> 00:26:50,633
Our job is done once
we divide this nation.

405
00:26:51,133 --> 00:26:52,466
We might never meet again.

406
00:26:54,133 --> 00:26:55,800
It'll be easier if
we hate each other.

407
00:26:56,508 --> 00:27:01,133
Well, the inspectors of Dorangla
and Sakkargarh have arrived.

408
00:27:03,633 --> 00:27:04,800
We have to go on an inspection.

409
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:06,633
Let's not delay anymore.

410
00:27:10,133 --> 00:27:13,508
It's already too late, Ilias.

411
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:16,925
It's too late.

412
00:27:18,341 --> 00:27:20,050
No, I want my mom to
put the ointment on.

413
00:27:20,175 --> 00:27:21,633
No, I want my mom to do it.
- Laadli.

414
00:27:21,758 --> 00:27:22,758
Your mother is busy. - No.

415
00:27:22,883 --> 00:27:24,550
No, I want my mom to apply the ointment.
- Laadli.

416
00:27:24,675 --> 00:27:28,425
Mom, please apply the ointment.
- Chhutki.

417
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:30,050
My eyes hurt.

418
00:27:30,175 --> 00:27:31,591
I've been telling
you since morning

419
00:27:31,716 --> 00:27:33,966
to let auntie apply the medicine.
Don't you get it?

420
00:27:34,091 --> 00:27:35,758
Jamila, don't shout at her.

421
00:27:35,883 --> 00:27:37,675
I'll drown you straight
in the Ganges.

422
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,716
Dear, show me, where it hurts?

423
00:27:39,841 --> 00:27:41,300
I'll give you some medicine.

424
00:27:41,425 --> 00:27:43,758
Only mom will apply the ointment.
- Don't cry.

425
00:27:43,883 --> 00:27:47,383
Stop crying, sweetheart.
- Ask mom to apply the ointment.

426
00:27:47,508 --> 00:27:49,258
Let's dance 'garba'.

427
00:27:49,383 --> 00:27:50,591
Come on. - I don't want to.

428
00:27:50,716 --> 00:27:53,050
Let's dance 'garba'
and let's play.

429
00:27:53,175 --> 00:27:55,925
Dear, listen to me. - Don't cry.

430
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:58,216
I will tell you a story.
- Let's play with your dolls.

431
00:27:58,341 --> 00:28:00,883
A man comes here leaving his
family problems behind.

432
00:28:01,466 --> 00:28:02,925
But it's the same
mess all over again.

433
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:04,341
Return my money.

434
00:28:04,466 --> 00:28:07,258
Can't you wait for a minute?

435
00:28:07,383 --> 00:28:08,925
You're in heat, aren't you?

436
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:12,591
Can't you see that mother-daughter
are having a conversation?

437
00:28:12,716 --> 00:28:16,466
Hold your horses for a second.
- It's all right, go ahead and talk.

438
00:28:16,591 --> 00:28:18,966
Patience is sweetly rewarded.

439
00:28:19,091 --> 00:28:23,466
Be patient.
- Listen, sweetheart, no need to wait.

440
00:28:23,591 --> 00:28:26,675
Come over to me. - Dear me.

441
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,591
Sweetheart.

442
00:28:29,716 --> 00:28:33,341
Stay in your limits
and let me do my job.

443
00:28:33,466 --> 00:28:35,091
Go handle your own clients.
- Get lost...

444
00:28:35,216 --> 00:28:36,925
Lata, shut up!
- Knock some sense into her.

445
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:41,216
You can leave if you like, but
you won't get a penny back.

446
00:28:41,341 --> 00:28:43,050
What's this? I didn't
even touch her.

447
00:28:43,175 --> 00:28:45,591
You didn't even touch her?

448
00:28:45,716 --> 00:28:47,008
What do you think of yourself?

449
00:28:47,133 --> 00:28:48,175
Hey!

450
00:28:48,675 --> 00:28:50,091
What's going on here?

451
00:28:50,758 --> 00:28:52,966
Why in the world are you
making such a racket?

452
00:28:53,758 --> 00:28:55,341
We have official
visitors from Lahore.

453
00:28:55,716 --> 00:28:56,550
Amba, Maina, Lata.

454
00:28:56,675 --> 00:28:59,133
Just check what they want.
- Come.

455
00:28:59,258 --> 00:29:00,800
And Gulabo must be done by now.

456
00:29:00,925 --> 00:29:02,091
If she isn't, tell her
to wrap up immediately.

457
00:29:02,216 --> 00:29:03,341
We need the rooms.

458
00:29:03,466 --> 00:29:04,300
Rubina. - Yes.

459
00:29:04,425 --> 00:29:06,508
Ask Sujeet to go play with Laadli.
- Yes.

460
00:29:06,633 --> 00:29:08,258
Aunty, go inside. Go. - Come.

461
00:29:08,383 --> 00:29:11,341
Why can't I stay with my mother?
- Because she's going with someone else.

462
00:29:11,466 --> 00:29:13,383
Why do you ask so
many questions?

463
00:29:13,508 --> 00:29:15,133
Laadli, listen.

464
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:19,758
This uncle here has some important
business with your mother

465
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:23,091
and I promised him he
wouldn't be disturbed.

466
00:29:23,841 --> 00:29:25,883
If you insist staying
with your mother

467
00:29:26,258 --> 00:29:28,300
then I'll be branded as a liar.

468
00:29:28,758 --> 00:29:31,716
Do you want people to
call Begum Jaan a liar?

469
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,383
You don't. Bravo. - Come on.

470
00:29:34,633 --> 00:29:37,716
Rubina! Call Sujeet. - Come on.

471
00:29:38,008 --> 00:29:43,175
So which side are we on?
- India.

472
00:29:43,966 --> 00:29:45,591
According to the Radcliffe Line

473
00:29:45,716 --> 00:29:48,966
the border will be erected
between Dorangla and Sakkargarh

474
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:52,175
and we'll install a barbwire
fence along the same line.

475
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:55,758
Draw lines and install
the barb wire fence.

476
00:29:55,883 --> 00:29:59,716
And there you have it, the
India and Pakistan border.

477
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:01,925
Is it that easy?

478
00:30:02,341 --> 00:30:05,008
Won't there be riots like
in Delhi, Amritsar, Lahore?

479
00:30:05,133 --> 00:30:08,341
Why? Are the people who live
here of a different kind?

480
00:30:09,425 --> 00:30:12,216
There will be riots, just
like on the other side.

481
00:30:12,966 --> 00:30:15,175
But the Muslim League will not
claim responsibility for it.

482
00:30:15,716 --> 00:30:18,716
People on both sides
must be properly warned.

483
00:30:18,841 --> 00:30:21,800
If they want to cross the
border, they must do it now.

484
00:30:21,925 --> 00:30:24,675
After that they will
massacre the minorities.

485
00:30:26,175 --> 00:30:29,550
When the time comes maybe we'll
do the same thing, Ilias.

486
00:30:30,258 --> 00:30:31,383
Like animals.

487
00:30:35,216 --> 00:30:36,841
Is this a wolf?

488
00:30:41,133 --> 00:30:43,341
Tiger. - He is crazy.

489
00:30:48,716 --> 00:30:49,925
Monkey.

490
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:52,716
Yes, monkey.
- What are you scratching?

491
00:30:53,883 --> 00:30:54,841
Jump!

492
00:30:54,966 --> 00:30:57,675
He looks just like a monkey.
- Now elephant.

493
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,008
Nice.

494
00:30:59,383 --> 00:31:00,675
Nice.

495
00:31:01,675 --> 00:31:02,800
That's an Elephant!

496
00:31:04,675 --> 00:31:05,716
Now recognize this.

497
00:31:05,841 --> 00:31:10,716
From the Bundelas and Harbolas
we heard her tales of glory.

498
00:31:11,341 --> 00:31:16,050
One who fought bravely, that
was the Queen of Jhansi.

499
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:18,216
Let it be, auntie.

500
00:31:18,341 --> 00:31:21,758
God knows what you teach her
and what she understands.

501
00:31:21,883 --> 00:31:25,383
She ruins my sleep by
asking questions all night.

502
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:26,925
Whoa!

503
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:29,300
How was it?

504
00:31:30,633 --> 00:31:32,758
Laadli, now try this.
- Who is it?

505
00:31:32,883 --> 00:31:35,758
Laadli, my sweetheart, my child.

506
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:37,675
The teacher's here,
with your books.

507
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,216
Where is he?

508
00:31:39,341 --> 00:31:41,800
Begum Jaan, the teacher.
- Teacher.

509
00:31:41,925 --> 00:31:43,008
Send him in.

510
00:31:43,341 --> 00:31:45,216
I'll call him.

511
00:31:45,341 --> 00:31:49,466
Uncle Salim, you look so small!

512
00:31:49,591 --> 00:31:50,841
Salim.

513
00:31:51,216 --> 00:31:53,966
Hey, enough of your stories.

514
00:31:54,091 --> 00:31:55,591
Get back to work everyone.

515
00:31:56,133 --> 00:31:58,800
Begum Jaan isn't
doing charity here.

516
00:31:59,216 --> 00:32:00,258
Go on.

517
00:32:00,591 --> 00:32:02,633
And Rubina, call Sujeet.

518
00:32:02,758 --> 00:32:04,216
You two take the day off today.
- Begum!

519
00:32:04,341 --> 00:32:05,883
Go out.

520
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,050
You want the day off, scumbag!

521
00:32:08,175 --> 00:32:10,633
I'll show you.

522
00:32:10,758 --> 00:32:13,383
Catch him. - Save me!

523
00:32:13,675 --> 00:32:15,591
I was just kidding.

524
00:32:16,841 --> 00:32:18,675
Catch him.

525
00:32:21,133 --> 00:32:22,716
According to Mr. Radcliffe

526
00:32:22,841 --> 00:32:24,633
the border will
pass through here.

527
00:32:25,841 --> 00:32:29,383
Across the jungle, and
alongside that lake.

528
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:33,633
On this side will be India, and
it's last station Dorangla.

529
00:32:33,758 --> 00:32:35,466
And on the other side
will be Sakkargarh

530
00:32:35,591 --> 00:32:37,508
Pakistan's first Police station.

531
00:32:38,841 --> 00:32:41,550
We'll have a border
checkpoint between them.

532
00:32:41,675 --> 00:32:43,216
What is this? - Did you...

533
00:32:44,716 --> 00:32:46,383
Mr. Srivastav, did you see that?

534
00:32:49,841 --> 00:32:51,716
Shyam, what is that? - Yes.

535
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:53,841
Generally you find them on
the outskirts of the city.

536
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,300
Away from homes and
neighborhoods.

537
00:32:56,425 --> 00:32:58,758
Is it a mosque? - No, no, sir.

538
00:32:59,008 --> 00:33:00,300
It's Begum Jaan's brothel.

539
00:33:00,591 --> 00:33:01,508
Brothel.

540
00:33:01,633 --> 00:33:04,008
Mr. Akhtar, we must raze it.

541
00:33:05,841 --> 00:33:10,508
Because the Radcliffe Line
will pass right through that.

542
00:33:10,966 --> 00:33:11,800
Exactly in the middle.

543
00:33:11,925 --> 00:33:15,258
Ilias, the border checkpoint will be
built upon the exact same location.

544
00:33:15,383 --> 00:33:16,841
Right? - Yes.

545
00:33:17,091 --> 00:33:18,633
So on the one side

546
00:33:18,758 --> 00:33:21,300
there will be India and
Pakistan on the other.

547
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:25,175
Are the British making
borders or fooling around?

548
00:33:26,883 --> 00:33:28,633
No, I mean...

549
00:33:28,758 --> 00:33:30,716
They must have thought
this through.

550
00:33:30,841 --> 00:33:34,591
Sir, can't we shift
the line a bit?

551
00:33:35,675 --> 00:33:39,383
Mister, a nation is getting
divided, people are dying

552
00:33:40,175 --> 00:33:42,300
and you want to know whether the
line could be shifted or not?

553
00:33:43,091 --> 00:33:44,925
The decision's been taken,
the map's been created.

554
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:46,550
Nothing can be shifted now.

555
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,716
Careful.

556
00:33:48,383 --> 00:33:49,758
And what's the matter?

557
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:53,508
I can sense that you're more scared
of this brothel than the border.

558
00:33:53,633 --> 00:33:54,841
What is the matter?

559
00:33:54,966 --> 00:33:56,508
You see... - Let me tell you.

560
00:33:57,508 --> 00:33:59,550
Begum Jaan, the owner
of that brothel.

561
00:34:00,008 --> 00:34:02,341
Actually, she's a serpent.

562
00:34:02,633 --> 00:34:05,383
She's a powerful woman with
friends in high places.

563
00:34:05,675 --> 00:34:07,091
From landlords to British,

564
00:34:07,216 --> 00:34:08,883
she has everyone in
the palm of her hand.

565
00:34:09,008 --> 00:34:11,799
What's more, even the
King is her benefactor.

566
00:34:12,049 --> 00:34:14,133
That's why, she isn't
scared of the law.

567
00:34:14,841 --> 00:34:16,341
That's obvious.

568
00:34:17,716 --> 00:34:19,799
Where is she from?
This Begum Jaan?

569
00:34:20,049 --> 00:34:22,008
No one knows her real name.

570
00:34:22,674 --> 00:34:24,633
But they say that she's
from around here.

571
00:34:25,424 --> 00:34:27,049
She went to Benares
after marriage.

572
00:34:27,924 --> 00:34:29,466
She became a widow
at a very young age.

573
00:34:29,799 --> 00:34:31,466
Someone sold her to a brothel.

574
00:34:32,466 --> 00:34:35,049
She stayed there for few days
and then fled to Lucknow.

575
00:34:35,466 --> 00:34:36,549
She became a courtesan.

576
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:37,841
She earned a lot of fame.

577
00:34:38,424 --> 00:34:39,966
She just returned a
couple of years ago

578
00:34:40,091 --> 00:34:42,841
and built this brothel
between these two towns.

579
00:34:43,133 --> 00:34:45,924
She had the king's support,
so she faced no difficulties.

580
00:34:46,049 --> 00:34:47,883
Singing, dancing, feasts.

581
00:34:48,008 --> 00:34:50,091
That place is full
of fun and frolic.

582
00:34:50,883 --> 00:34:55,008
"Every girl in Brij
celebrates 'Holi'."

583
00:34:55,133 --> 00:34:59,508
"Every girl in Brij
celebrates 'Holi'."

584
00:34:59,633 --> 00:35:03,675
"From their body and
from the heart."

585
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:09,633
"They've drenched themselves
in colors with Kanha."

586
00:35:09,758 --> 00:35:13,758
"Every girl in Brij
celebrates 'Holi'."

587
00:35:13,883 --> 00:35:19,133
"Every girl in Brij
celebrates 'Holi'."

588
00:35:20,008 --> 00:35:22,091
"Peacock feathers in the air."

589
00:35:22,216 --> 00:35:24,091
"The sound of the
flute's resonating."

590
00:35:24,216 --> 00:35:26,216
"The pots break, the
milkmaids are decked up"

591
00:35:26,341 --> 00:35:28,633
"Every lane in Vrindavan"

592
00:35:28,758 --> 00:35:30,716
"is soaked in the
colors of Kanha."

593
00:35:30,841 --> 00:35:32,758
"is soaked in the
colors of Kanha."

594
00:35:32,883 --> 00:35:36,966
"Every girl in Brij
celebrates 'Holi'."

595
00:35:37,091 --> 00:35:38,841
"Every girl in Brij."

596
00:35:38,966 --> 00:35:44,175
"Every girl in Brij
celebrates 'Holi'."

597
00:35:51,175 --> 00:35:55,216
"The clouds are thundering"

598
00:35:55,341 --> 00:35:59,383
"and the body sways
to its tune."

599
00:35:59,508 --> 00:36:03,633
"We're so fortunate"

600
00:36:03,758 --> 00:36:07,800
"our courtyard's filled
with all the colors."

601
00:36:07,925 --> 00:36:12,508
"Our courtyard's filled
with all the colors."

602
00:36:13,591 --> 00:36:15,258
"Free wandering soul"

603
00:36:15,966 --> 00:36:17,675
"high on cannabis."

604
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:21,925
"Lord Shankar's on
our threshold."

605
00:36:22,466 --> 00:36:26,550
"What has happened?"

606
00:36:26,675 --> 00:36:30,466
"Every color has turned
in to the color of love."

607
00:36:30,591 --> 00:36:34,591
"The season can't
differentiate."

608
00:36:34,716 --> 00:36:39,050
"The season can't
differentiate."

609
00:36:39,175 --> 00:36:43,133
"When your body touched
mine, my world lit up"

610
00:36:43,258 --> 00:36:45,091
"when you colored me."

611
00:36:45,216 --> 00:36:49,550
"Every girl in Brij
celebrates 'Holi'."

612
00:36:49,675 --> 00:36:53,716
"From their body and
from the heart."

613
00:36:53,841 --> 00:36:59,591
"They've drenched themselves
in colors with Kanha."

614
00:36:59,716 --> 00:37:05,008
"Every girl in Brij
celebrates 'Holi'."

615
00:37:08,966 --> 00:37:10,925
After her husband's demise

616
00:37:11,341 --> 00:37:13,550
things started getting
ugly for Meera.

617
00:37:14,008 --> 00:37:16,425
She was an ardent devotee
of Lord Krishna.

618
00:37:16,966 --> 00:37:18,216
But she faced

619
00:37:18,591 --> 00:37:23,633
increasing atrocities from King
Bhoj's brother, Vikramaditya.

620
00:37:24,675 --> 00:37:27,925
For his greed of the throne,
Vikramaditya played a ruse

621
00:37:28,383 --> 00:37:32,925
and laced the
sweetmeats with poison.

622
00:37:33,383 --> 00:37:35,550
Meera ate it, but no
harm came to her.

623
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:38,383
Vikramaditya was
shocked and surprised.

624
00:37:38,508 --> 00:37:39,758
How is this possible?

625
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:43,591
It was Lord Krishna who turned
the poison into nectar.

626
00:37:43,966 --> 00:37:45,425
Then, he came up
with another ruse.

627
00:37:45,925 --> 00:37:50,300
He put nails on Meera's bed.

628
00:37:50,966 --> 00:37:52,425
But Meera wasn't scared.

629
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:54,258
She sang the praises
of Lord Krishna.

630
00:37:54,883 --> 00:37:58,966
They say Lord Krishna
foiled this ruse as well

631
00:37:59,091 --> 00:38:03,133
and He turned all the
nails into rose petals.

632
00:38:04,258 --> 00:38:08,716
Meera forsook all earthly ties

633
00:38:09,425 --> 00:38:11,091
and devoted herself
to Lord Krishna.

634
00:38:11,216 --> 00:38:12,925
Who do we worship, auntie?

635
00:38:13,175 --> 00:38:14,508
Who is our God?

636
00:38:15,133 --> 00:38:18,133
"I was talking to the peacock
and that's what she said."

637
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:20,341
The king brought
this doll for me.

638
00:38:20,466 --> 00:38:22,466
Show me that doll.
- No. I won't.

639
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:26,466
I have a severe stomachache...
- Begum.

640
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,341
I said I have a stomachache.

641
00:38:28,466 --> 00:38:29,758
Why? Can't I be sick?

642
00:38:30,133 --> 00:38:33,341
If you get too rough, it
may just all come out.

643
00:38:34,508 --> 00:38:36,883
Begum Jaan, Gulabo's
making excuses.

644
00:38:37,341 --> 00:38:38,800
Gulabo, hurry up.

645
00:38:38,925 --> 00:38:41,341
Gulabo, hurry up.

646
00:38:41,466 --> 00:38:43,758
Don't be stubborn, Gulabo.
Go inside.

647
00:38:43,883 --> 00:38:47,383
Begum Jaan, let me go.
- Shut up.

648
00:38:47,508 --> 00:38:49,216
"Let me go." Bitch.

649
00:38:49,341 --> 00:38:50,883
Didn't you hear what I said?

650
00:38:51,758 --> 00:38:54,008
I've already accepted
token, now go inside.

651
00:38:54,591 --> 00:38:56,925
I really have a bad case of
loose motions, believe me.

652
00:38:57,175 --> 00:38:59,591
Even my hands and legs are paining,
and I think I have fever too.

653
00:39:02,591 --> 00:39:04,966
Don't give me excuses during
business hours, Gulabo.

654
00:39:05,633 --> 00:39:08,675
I know why you fall
sick every Friday.

655
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,800
Because the teacher visits us.

656
00:39:13,758 --> 00:39:16,341
If you want to fall in love,
then go someplace else.

657
00:39:16,466 --> 00:39:17,508
Understood?

658
00:39:18,091 --> 00:39:19,175
Why?

659
00:39:20,383 --> 00:39:22,466
You want to enjoy with
the teacher alone.

660
00:39:24,966 --> 00:39:26,425
Begum Jaan, if you're free

661
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:29,300
we have some government
officers, with a legal notice.

662
00:39:32,883 --> 00:39:35,508
Greetings, Begum Jaan. All fine?

663
00:39:36,966 --> 00:39:38,800
Salim. - Yes, Begum Jaan.

664
00:39:39,341 --> 00:39:41,633
Take the dogs outside

665
00:39:41,758 --> 00:39:44,175
and see that they don't
cross the threshold.

666
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:46,133
Okay, Begum Jaan.

667
00:39:49,883 --> 00:39:51,300
So what were you saying?

668
00:39:51,883 --> 00:39:55,008
Because if you've come
here to enjoy for free

669
00:39:55,133 --> 00:39:57,383
then, I am sure you
remember my answer.

670
00:39:58,675 --> 00:40:01,216
Begum Jaan, you're
embarrassing me.

671
00:40:01,716 --> 00:40:03,925
Actually, I'm here for
a different reason.

672
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:07,091
Why? Not in the mood today, Mr.
Shyam?

673
00:40:08,675 --> 00:40:10,841
Have you found
another scapegoat?

674
00:40:10,966 --> 00:40:13,633
Have some shame, Begum Jaan.

675
00:40:13,758 --> 00:40:16,425
These are top officials
from India and Pakistan

676
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:17,841
and they have legal
orders for you.

677
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:20,175
Dear me! Again.

678
00:40:20,758 --> 00:40:24,258
Look, sir, we can't go to the
camp for medical checkups.

679
00:40:24,633 --> 00:40:26,008
I know syphilis, etcetera,
can be bothersome

680
00:40:26,133 --> 00:40:27,383
even if you don't have it.

681
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:29,925
And these bloody
foreigners enjoy for free.

682
00:40:30,508 --> 00:40:33,508
Forget about paying the price...
- We're not here for that.

683
00:40:35,341 --> 00:40:37,883
We have eviction notice. - Huh?

684
00:40:38,341 --> 00:40:39,508
What notice?

685
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,925
Eviction?

686
00:40:43,466 --> 00:40:45,591
You must vacate this
brothel, Begum Jaan.

687
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:49,258
The India-Pakistan border

688
00:40:49,591 --> 00:40:52,300
will run right through this brothel.
Right in the middle.

689
00:40:52,883 --> 00:40:54,091
We'll build a checkpoint here.

690
00:40:54,216 --> 00:40:55,591
India-and-Pakistan.

691
00:40:55,716 --> 00:40:57,341
India-and-Pakistan.

692
00:41:12,091 --> 00:41:15,091
Maina. Hey, Maina.
Quickly open the door.

693
00:41:15,216 --> 00:41:16,175
Maina.

694
00:41:16,883 --> 00:41:17,841
What?

695
00:41:18,175 --> 00:41:19,591
They say we'll be
thrown out of here.

696
00:41:19,716 --> 00:41:22,050
Have you lost your mind?
How can they throw us out?

697
00:41:22,175 --> 00:41:23,383
Come with me...

698
00:41:23,508 --> 00:41:25,883
You have to hurry.
- Hail Lord Krishna...

699
00:41:26,008 --> 00:41:28,425
I'll teach them a lesson.
- Amba, what are you doing?

700
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:29,716
How dare they throw us out!

701
00:41:29,841 --> 00:41:31,341
Here. Hide it. - Amba.

702
00:41:31,466 --> 00:41:32,758
Hide it. - What are you saying?

703
00:41:32,883 --> 00:41:35,091
Damn! I have to see it.
- Where are you going?

704
00:41:35,216 --> 00:41:37,341
My dagger... Wait.

705
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,258
Come on.

706
00:41:47,091 --> 00:41:48,633
Where will we go?

707
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:52,008
My home's right here.

708
00:41:53,508 --> 00:41:54,758
Won't you settle down?

709
00:41:57,758 --> 00:41:59,300
Somewhere, away from this filth.

710
00:42:03,091 --> 00:42:05,091
You're so stupid.

711
00:42:07,466 --> 00:42:09,133
This is my home.

712
00:42:11,383 --> 00:42:12,883
I don't like all this.

713
00:42:14,925 --> 00:42:15,841
What?

714
00:42:18,383 --> 00:42:20,716
A new man enters your
room every night.

715
00:42:22,258 --> 00:42:24,716
Entire night... - Sure.

716
00:42:25,216 --> 00:42:29,425
You bring customers
for me, don't you?

717
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:30,841
Yes, I know.

718
00:42:31,508 --> 00:42:32,758
I can't help it.

719
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:35,633
I owe Begum Jaan a big amount.

720
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:37,716
She's done so much for me.

721
00:42:38,216 --> 00:42:39,550
So even I have a
responsibility...

722
00:42:43,133 --> 00:42:45,966
So what if I am a pimp?
Can't I love someone?

723
00:42:48,591 --> 00:42:49,508
What?

724
00:42:52,133 --> 00:42:53,425
What did you just say?

725
00:42:55,258 --> 00:42:58,050
What can't you do? - Love.

726
00:42:59,716 --> 00:43:01,133
What's so funny?

727
00:43:03,133 --> 00:43:04,466
Okay, okay.

728
00:43:05,425 --> 00:43:07,925
Say it in English.

729
00:43:08,466 --> 00:43:10,133
It's not important.

730
00:43:10,258 --> 00:43:13,008
Say it, please, say it.

731
00:43:17,008 --> 00:43:18,841
I... love you!

732
00:43:21,758 --> 00:43:23,008
Wow!

733
00:43:33,091 --> 00:43:34,550
I love you!

734
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:39,925
Dear me!

735
00:43:50,466 --> 00:43:52,883
Listen, Sujeet.

736
00:43:53,425 --> 00:43:55,508
Don't cry like a woman.

737
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,300
Get away, you whore!

738
00:43:58,050 --> 00:44:00,841
I can't bear the fact that
any scumbag can touch you!

739
00:44:01,216 --> 00:44:03,508
Someday, I'll cut
them to pieces!

740
00:44:13,508 --> 00:44:15,300
What... What happened?

741
00:44:18,675 --> 00:44:19,800
What's this?

742
00:44:21,716 --> 00:44:22,716
My breasts.

743
00:44:25,091 --> 00:44:27,300
Mothers use them to
suckle their baby.

744
00:44:29,508 --> 00:44:31,341
Nothing more than
a piece of flesh.

745
00:44:37,425 --> 00:44:38,591
What's this?

746
00:44:39,466 --> 00:44:40,508
Ask me.

747
00:44:42,508 --> 00:44:45,258
It's just like any other
part of the body.

748
00:44:47,633 --> 00:44:50,716
Just flesh. Nothing more.

749
00:44:53,675 --> 00:44:55,091
Auntie says...

750
00:44:57,008 --> 00:44:59,300
Like it says in the 'Gita'.

751
00:45:01,050 --> 00:45:02,591
Like old clothes.

752
00:45:05,008 --> 00:45:06,675
We change it every day.

753
00:45:13,133 --> 00:45:14,091
It's nothing.

754
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:18,716
I am Rubi.

755
00:45:22,133 --> 00:45:24,175
Sujeet's Rubi.

756
00:45:26,758 --> 00:45:28,633
Rubina doesn't exist anymore.

757
00:45:31,258 --> 00:45:32,383
She is right here.

758
00:45:51,050 --> 00:45:52,508
Silly boy.

759
00:45:57,925 --> 00:45:59,925
This is an official notice.

760
00:46:00,175 --> 00:46:02,300
One from Delhi and the
other from Karachi.

761
00:46:03,216 --> 00:46:05,800
Boundary Commission
Act is the new law

762
00:46:05,925 --> 00:46:08,966
under which it's been decided to
chalk out an international border

763
00:46:09,091 --> 00:46:11,300
between India and Pakistan.

764
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:13,966
Do you know what a border means?

765
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:15,758
A perimeter.

766
00:46:16,216 --> 00:46:19,800
We'll erect a barbwire
between both the nations...

767
00:46:20,091 --> 00:46:24,466
Unfortunately Begum Jaan, Sir
Radcliffe's line, this barbwire

768
00:46:24,716 --> 00:46:27,425
will be erected right
through your brothel.

769
00:46:28,383 --> 00:46:30,675
Now, do you understand...
- Hold on a moment.

770
00:46:31,966 --> 00:46:35,341
Let me first understand this
stupid concept of the barb wire.

771
00:46:35,591 --> 00:46:38,675
So, across the courtyard,

772
00:46:39,716 --> 00:46:44,383
where Rubina, Rani,
Laadli are standing

773
00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:46,133
will be India?

774
00:46:47,550 --> 00:46:50,800
And on this side, where
Amba, Maina are standing

775
00:46:51,216 --> 00:46:52,300
will be Pakistan?

776
00:46:54,925 --> 00:46:55,883
Yes.

777
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:59,008
Yes? - Yes.

778
00:47:00,633 --> 00:47:01,800
Read it for yourself.

779
00:47:02,883 --> 00:47:03,966
Can you read?

780
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,300
Senile old men!

781
00:47:29,466 --> 00:47:30,800
He makes no sense.

782
00:47:34,425 --> 00:47:36,258
What happened?
- I don't know what's wrong.

783
00:47:36,383 --> 00:47:37,883
What's going on?

784
00:47:39,591 --> 00:47:41,258
What is so funny?

785
00:47:42,633 --> 00:47:46,466
Sir, your Mr. Radcliffe
turned out to be a butcher.

786
00:47:47,133 --> 00:47:48,633
And an amateur at that.

787
00:47:50,508 --> 00:47:54,091
If he wanted to divide the country he
should've been gentle and surgical.

788
00:47:54,216 --> 00:47:57,383
In fact, Rahim can gut the
goat better than that.

789
00:47:57,508 --> 00:47:58,508
Isn't that right?

790
00:47:59,591 --> 00:48:00,675
Ribs.

791
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:01,800
Thighs.

792
00:48:01,925 --> 00:48:03,966
Kidneys. Liver.

793
00:48:04,091 --> 00:48:06,466
Slicing in the middle...
- Begum Jaan.

794
00:48:07,216 --> 00:48:10,425
I think you're not aware of the
seriousness of this situation.

795
00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:12,300
So let me explain you again.

796
00:48:13,258 --> 00:48:16,633
From next month, we'll
start laying barbed wires

797
00:48:16,758 --> 00:48:18,591
on the Indian-Pakistan border.

798
00:48:19,175 --> 00:48:21,008
The Hindus and Muslims of the
cities adjoining this line,

799
00:48:21,133 --> 00:48:24,300
which is Dorangla and Sakkargarh

800
00:48:24,425 --> 00:48:27,216
will be advised to
cross the border.

801
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:30,758
Because the recent gruesome
incidence are an ample proof

802
00:48:30,883 --> 00:48:35,883
that Hindus in Pakistan and
Muslims in India are not safe.

803
00:48:37,133 --> 00:48:39,133
And exactly at this point,
where we're standing,

804
00:48:39,258 --> 00:48:41,216
we'll be building a
border checkpoint

805
00:48:41,550 --> 00:48:44,633
where the men, goods, and
cattle will cross the border.

806
00:48:45,591 --> 00:48:49,300
There can be riots between
Hindus and Muslims as well.

807
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:53,050
So we advise you...
- Hey, did you pay the price?

808
00:48:53,675 --> 00:48:56,008
Yes. - Money?

809
00:48:56,841 --> 00:48:58,050
Yes, I paid you in full.

810
00:48:58,466 --> 00:49:02,800
Why? Did you ask about the
girl's caste, her religion?

811
00:49:02,925 --> 00:49:04,300
Is she Hindu or Muslim?

812
00:49:04,758 --> 00:49:05,508
What do you mean?

813
00:49:05,633 --> 00:49:08,466
I mean, what has religion got to do...
- And you, Mr. half-naked

814
00:49:08,591 --> 00:49:09,883
What is your caste?

815
00:49:10,008 --> 00:49:11,800
Caste? Well, I am a Brahmin.

816
00:49:11,925 --> 00:49:15,675
You were in a bed with a girl.
Do you know her caste?

817
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:17,716
Won't it defile
your sensibilities?

818
00:49:18,466 --> 00:49:20,550
No, I mean...
- You know what, mister?

819
00:49:21,216 --> 00:49:22,133
I mean, officers.

820
00:49:23,008 --> 00:49:25,175
We didn't ask them any
questions either.

821
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:27,383
Caste, creed, religion.

822
00:49:28,925 --> 00:49:33,258
They just chose a girl, fixed
a price and we welcomed them.

823
00:49:34,091 --> 00:49:35,050
Did you get it?

824
00:49:35,175 --> 00:49:36,883
There's nothing to understand.

825
00:49:37,758 --> 00:49:39,675
Every brothel... - Mister.

826
00:49:41,925 --> 00:49:45,550
Call this brothel
or a whorehouse.

827
00:49:46,008 --> 00:49:48,758
This is my home, my country.

828
00:49:49,758 --> 00:49:53,966
There are no Hindus or
Muslims, high or low caste.

829
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:57,841
It's our body, our will

830
00:49:58,466 --> 00:50:00,883
and our law goes around here.

831
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:06,300
I still don't understand which India and
Pakistan you two are talking about.

832
00:50:06,591 --> 00:50:09,091
That teacher keeps telling me

833
00:50:09,216 --> 00:50:13,133
about the Congress, Muslim
League, Nehru, Jinnah.

834
00:50:13,258 --> 00:50:15,508
Delhi, Karachi,
Partition etcetera.

835
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:18,008
But this is just
nonsense for us.

836
00:50:18,133 --> 00:50:19,383
Utter nonsense.

837
00:50:20,466 --> 00:50:22,300
Because we don't care about

838
00:50:22,425 --> 00:50:25,841
what decisions those rascals
are taking in Delhi.

839
00:50:26,925 --> 00:50:29,716
This is our bread,
this is our butter.

840
00:50:29,841 --> 00:50:32,008
It's our home and our brothel.

841
00:50:36,258 --> 00:50:39,008
Before anyone can
throw us out of here

842
00:50:40,466 --> 00:50:42,925
we'd rather tear him
from limb to limb...

843
00:50:44,133 --> 00:50:45,550
What do you guys say?

844
00:50:46,341 --> 00:50:47,758
We'll partition his body.

845
00:50:47,883 --> 00:50:49,300
You wretch.

846
00:50:49,883 --> 00:50:51,008
Don't you dare!

847
00:50:51,466 --> 00:50:52,841
I will kill you.

848
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:55,841
Get your hands off!
- Keep it down.

849
00:50:55,966 --> 00:50:57,091
How dare you scare us!

850
00:50:57,216 --> 00:50:58,341
Run away.

851
00:51:12,466 --> 00:51:13,591
Salim!

852
00:51:16,050 --> 00:51:17,466
Guests!

853
00:51:26,758 --> 00:51:29,508
We were as polite
as we could be.

854
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:31,675
Come on.

855
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,258
Goodbye, Begum Jaan.

856
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:35,800
You have a month's time.

857
00:51:36,550 --> 00:51:39,216
Only one month. Get it?

858
00:51:40,633 --> 00:51:42,758
We certainly know a thing or
two about periods and months.

859
00:51:45,175 --> 00:51:47,300
They leaves me bloodied
every single time.

860
00:51:49,841 --> 00:51:50,966
Ilias.

861
00:51:55,883 --> 00:51:57,841
Get lost! - Move it.

862
00:51:58,258 --> 00:51:59,883
Run away. - Get lost.

863
00:52:02,133 --> 00:52:03,258
Get lost!

864
00:52:22,258 --> 00:52:25,300
The brave woman, whose story I
am going to tell you today,

865
00:52:25,425 --> 00:52:27,425
her name was Razia Sultana.

866
00:52:27,883 --> 00:52:29,716
Pay attention and sit properly.

867
00:52:32,341 --> 00:52:34,675
At a very young age, Razia knew

868
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,466
that she had to take care of
the kingdom when she grows up.

869
00:52:38,550 --> 00:52:40,716
The throne was her
greatest strength

870
00:52:41,050 --> 00:52:42,925
and her greatest foe.

871
00:52:43,425 --> 00:52:45,133
Because her own
people didn't want

872
00:52:45,258 --> 00:52:47,633
Razia to ascend the throne.

873
00:52:47,758 --> 00:52:49,550
But Razia was determined

874
00:52:49,675 --> 00:52:53,591
to do everything on her
own strength, her will.

875
00:52:53,925 --> 00:52:59,050
Amongst all the emperors,
she was the only empress.

876
00:52:59,383 --> 00:53:01,216
Razia Sultana.

877
00:53:01,841 --> 00:53:04,258
She raised her own army.

878
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:06,758
Carved a niche for
herself in history.

879
00:53:07,925 --> 00:53:12,091
You must make yourself
proud when you grow up.

880
00:53:13,758 --> 00:53:15,800
How dare those scoundrels!

881
00:53:16,175 --> 00:53:19,925
They come and tell me, Begum Jaan
that I'll have to evict my brothel!

882
00:53:21,258 --> 00:53:22,758
How dare they!

883
00:53:22,883 --> 00:53:25,425
Calm down, Begum Jaan.
It's not their fault.

884
00:53:26,133 --> 00:53:27,175
The order's come from above.

885
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:28,550
I don't care where it came from.

886
00:53:28,675 --> 00:53:31,341
How dare they stand
in my brothel

887
00:53:31,466 --> 00:53:33,466
and give me a month's notice!

888
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:36,883
Teacher, you've connections
in the political party.

889
00:53:37,133 --> 00:53:40,591
I want those two transferred
in a month's time.

890
00:53:40,925 --> 00:53:42,675
I'll give you anything you want.

891
00:53:43,091 --> 00:53:45,716
If the demand is for girls,
then I'll arrange for that.

892
00:53:45,966 --> 00:53:47,091
Otherwise, I'll go myself...

893
00:53:47,216 --> 00:53:49,633
Begum Jaan, not every problem
has the same solution.

894
00:53:50,050 --> 00:53:52,925
You shouldn't be angry with them. One
of them is from a different party.

895
00:53:53,050 --> 00:53:54,758
Assholes! All of them!

896
00:53:56,175 --> 00:53:59,675
I'll talk to the
party high command.

897
00:54:00,675 --> 00:54:02,008
We can at least try
to get a stay order

898
00:54:02,133 --> 00:54:03,133
and then we can look
for a different place.

899
00:54:03,258 --> 00:54:05,675
It's quite late. You
must be hungry.

900
00:54:06,550 --> 00:54:10,300
How about you eat
something first?

901
00:54:12,091 --> 00:54:13,258
I'll take your leave now.

902
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:15,383
I'll speak to the party
high command tomorrow.

903
00:54:16,091 --> 00:54:17,883
At least, have dinner, teacher.

904
00:54:20,925 --> 00:54:21,925
I am not hungry.

905
00:54:25,716 --> 00:54:26,925
Don't you have a
stomachache tonight?

906
00:54:27,216 --> 00:54:29,925
Standing there with a sad face.
Go, get my hookah.

907
00:54:31,175 --> 00:54:32,883
I'll speak to the
teacher about you.

908
00:54:33,425 --> 00:54:35,383
Did she have to
fall in love now?

909
00:54:37,883 --> 00:54:40,341
Get out!

910
00:54:40,466 --> 00:54:42,758
Get out!

911
00:54:43,216 --> 00:54:44,258
Get it?

912
00:54:44,383 --> 00:54:46,550
Don't ever come back!

913
00:54:48,633 --> 00:54:51,508
What's wrong? Are
you feeling okay?

914
00:54:52,133 --> 00:54:56,258
Begum Jaan, did you
see a nightmare?

915
00:54:56,675 --> 00:54:58,966
Why were you scared?
What happened?

916
00:54:59,341 --> 00:55:02,633
We must send a message.
- To whom, dear?

917
00:55:02,758 --> 00:55:04,758
To His Highness. - His highness?

918
00:55:07,591 --> 00:55:08,716
Begum Jaan?

919
00:55:17,716 --> 00:55:18,675
Salim!

920
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:30,966
Half the expenses for the
wood will be borne by Delhi.

921
00:55:31,633 --> 00:55:33,050
Give this over there.

922
00:55:41,216 --> 00:55:42,508
8 million.

923
00:55:44,050 --> 00:55:45,216
In Punjab alone.

924
00:55:46,133 --> 00:55:48,216
According to
official statistics.

925
00:55:49,758 --> 00:55:51,841
Better remember
these three words.

926
00:55:53,341 --> 00:55:55,550
8 million homeless.

927
00:55:57,550 --> 00:56:00,675
We must tell the people
why this is happening.

928
00:56:03,425 --> 00:56:04,800
Tell them about the
millions of homeless,

929
00:56:04,925 --> 00:56:06,550
tell them about the dead bodies.

930
00:56:08,008 --> 00:56:10,008
Tell them about the
bloodshed, and everything.

931
00:56:11,925 --> 00:56:13,841
Else no one will
leave their homes.

932
00:56:15,425 --> 00:56:16,591
Of course, they will.

933
00:56:17,133 --> 00:56:19,841
The bloodshed in Amritsar,
Allahabad, Ahmedabad, Bombay.

934
00:56:20,383 --> 00:56:22,758
All the things our
boys have done there

935
00:56:23,258 --> 00:56:26,091
when the Moslems in
Dorangala find out...

936
00:56:33,466 --> 00:56:34,883
Sorry. Just...

937
00:56:37,550 --> 00:56:39,758
Sorry. - Moslems!

938
00:56:40,425 --> 00:56:42,758
Muzzies! Mullah!

939
00:56:47,508 --> 00:56:48,466
Very good.

940
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:52,883
Even we have a number
of tales, Hari Prasad.

941
00:56:55,216 --> 00:56:59,716
But that night, when they
were taking off their clothes

942
00:56:59,841 --> 00:57:01,675
I didn't see your face in them.

943
00:57:02,466 --> 00:57:04,633
And I still don't.
- Then do it, Ilias!

944
00:57:04,758 --> 00:57:06,966
Do it. It's important.

945
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:11,591
You must harbor hatred, you
must harbor differences.

946
00:57:12,466 --> 00:57:14,758
Otherwise, you will never
be able to do this job.

947
00:57:15,175 --> 00:57:17,675
Or live. - Fine.

948
00:57:19,216 --> 00:57:20,341
Let's talk then.

949
00:57:22,425 --> 00:57:24,508
If people cross the border,
then that's fine...

950
00:57:24,633 --> 00:57:26,508
People will have to move.

951
00:57:27,758 --> 00:57:30,758
"There's a heave of sigh here"

952
00:57:30,883 --> 00:57:33,508
"and a heave of sigh there."

953
00:57:33,883 --> 00:57:39,300
"Bravo this independence."

954
00:57:40,175 --> 00:57:43,091
"There's a heave of sigh here"

955
00:57:43,216 --> 00:57:46,300
"and a heave of sigh there."

956
00:57:46,425 --> 00:57:50,841
"Bravo this independence."

957
00:57:52,633 --> 00:57:58,591
"Your roofs, your lands."

958
00:57:58,883 --> 00:58:04,883
"Your daggers and your borders."

959
00:58:05,008 --> 00:58:10,383
"Just tell me,
where is my home?"

960
00:58:11,258 --> 00:58:14,258
"There's a heave of sigh here"

961
00:58:14,383 --> 00:58:17,425
"and a heave of sigh there."

962
00:58:17,550 --> 00:58:22,175
"Bravo this independence."

963
00:58:23,716 --> 00:58:25,925
"Independence."

964
00:58:26,050 --> 00:58:29,008
"Independence."

965
00:58:29,133 --> 00:58:32,925
"Independence."

966
00:58:33,050 --> 00:58:37,300
"Independence."

967
00:58:48,508 --> 00:58:51,633
"I left my veil
hanging on the rope."

968
00:58:51,758 --> 00:58:54,675
"I left my shirt hanging
on the hangar."

969
00:58:54,800 --> 00:59:00,633
"Where did I leave my honor?"

970
00:59:01,008 --> 00:59:04,091
"I left Allah in the dome"

971
00:59:04,216 --> 00:59:07,216
"and the Lord in
the differences."

972
00:59:07,341 --> 00:59:12,591
"Where did I leave Rama?"

973
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:16,508
"Where are the
people who matter?"

974
00:59:16,633 --> 00:59:19,258
"Where are the angels?"

975
00:59:19,383 --> 00:59:25,841
"Tell me, where is
that paradise?"

976
00:59:25,966 --> 00:59:32,008
"Find me that paradise,
where is it?"

977
00:59:32,133 --> 00:59:34,758
"There's a heave of sigh here"

978
00:59:35,216 --> 00:59:38,008
"and a heave of sigh there."

979
00:59:38,341 --> 00:59:43,966
"Bravo this independence."

980
00:59:44,591 --> 00:59:50,591
"Your knock, your fists."

981
00:59:50,716 --> 00:59:56,883
"You can keep your soil."

982
00:59:57,008 --> 01:00:02,758
"Tell me, where is my home?"

983
01:00:03,258 --> 01:00:06,258
"There's a heave of sigh here"

984
01:00:06,383 --> 01:00:09,300
"and a heave of sigh there."

985
01:00:09,425 --> 01:00:15,550
"Bravo this independence."

986
01:00:15,675 --> 01:00:17,841
"Independence."

987
01:00:17,966 --> 01:00:20,925
"Independence."

988
01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:24,841
"Independence."

989
01:00:24,966 --> 01:00:28,216
"Independence."

990
01:00:28,341 --> 01:00:31,091
"Independence."

991
01:00:31,216 --> 01:00:33,466
"Independence."

992
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:36,841
"Independence."

993
01:00:37,383 --> 01:00:40,216
"Independence."

994
01:01:12,466 --> 01:01:13,758
So just imagine, Your Highness.

995
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:17,341
He threatened me on my turf.

996
01:01:19,008 --> 01:01:20,466
And threatening me means

997
01:01:20,883 --> 01:01:22,883
threatening His
Highness' servant.

998
01:01:25,050 --> 01:01:26,341
What is his name?

999
01:01:26,925 --> 01:01:30,133
Someone called Srivastav
and Ilias, Your Highness.

1000
01:01:30,758 --> 01:01:33,591
And the inspectors of
Dorangla and Sakkargarh

1001
01:01:33,716 --> 01:01:35,508
also treat us quite unfairly.

1002
01:01:35,633 --> 01:01:38,341
They are just mice.

1003
01:01:38,758 --> 01:01:41,758
To bell the cat, I
must go to Delhi.

1004
01:01:43,716 --> 01:01:46,050
After all, they are
government officials.

1005
01:01:46,383 --> 01:01:47,966
I'll go this month.

1006
01:01:48,841 --> 01:01:50,966
Don't worry, Begum Jaan.

1007
01:01:52,133 --> 01:01:53,675
No one will bother you.

1008
01:01:55,008 --> 01:01:56,716
Thank you, Your Highness.

1009
01:01:57,633 --> 01:01:58,841
But please,

1010
01:01:59,675 --> 01:02:03,300
Your Highness, don't get into
a fit of rage and kill them.

1011
01:02:05,008 --> 01:02:06,966
Their dismissal is enough.

1012
01:02:07,758 --> 01:02:08,758
Your Highness.

1013
01:02:10,758 --> 01:02:13,841
You brought so many gifts
for everyone again.

1014
01:02:14,508 --> 01:02:16,883
You've really
pampered these girls.

1015
01:02:17,008 --> 01:02:21,175
Well, the brothel stays closed for
a couple of days because of me.

1016
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:24,008
After all, it's my responsibility...
- Dear me.

1017
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:25,758
What are you saying,
Your Highness?

1018
01:02:25,883 --> 01:02:28,675
This brothel is all yours
and so are the girls.

1019
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:29,800
Even I...

1020
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:40,425
So who should I present today?

1021
01:02:40,883 --> 01:02:41,841
Gulabo?

1022
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:45,883
Or would you prefer
Rubina or Lata?

1023
01:02:47,675 --> 01:02:53,050
I've heard that there's a
new girl staying with you.

1024
01:02:53,341 --> 01:02:55,216
But I didn't see her
with the others.

1025
01:02:56,175 --> 01:02:58,216
You've hidden her from us.

1026
01:02:59,966 --> 01:03:01,675
No...

1027
01:03:02,883 --> 01:03:06,050
Maybe Shabnam was
playing outside.

1028
01:03:06,425 --> 01:03:09,258
She's been through a terrible
ordeal, Your Highness.

1029
01:03:09,550 --> 01:03:10,466
And so...

1030
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:14,341
I mean, she's still
not been trained...

1031
01:03:14,466 --> 01:03:17,591
You stay safe here
because of me.

1032
01:03:20,883 --> 01:03:24,300
No one bothers you, because
I've taken your responsibility.

1033
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:28,633
And foreigners and governors,
who spend their nights here

1034
01:03:28,758 --> 01:03:31,091
don't do it for free.

1035
01:03:33,258 --> 01:03:37,883
In fact, even your taxes are
paid from the royal treasury.

1036
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:41,258
Huh?

1037
01:03:41,550 --> 01:03:45,258
And in return, I expect
only a little something.

1038
01:03:46,591 --> 01:03:47,466
I hope you remember.

1039
01:03:48,883 --> 01:03:49,883
Sure, Your Highness.

1040
01:03:51,591 --> 01:03:55,883
Whenever you get a new girl, the
first right to break her in

1041
01:03:59,966 --> 01:04:03,216
Belongs to you.
- No. To the king.

1042
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:09,008
Whether she's a virgin
or experienced.

1043
01:04:09,550 --> 01:04:12,758
Get her ready. I'll be leaving
early in the morning.

1044
01:04:13,425 --> 01:04:14,383
Yes, Your Highness.

1045
01:04:14,633 --> 01:04:16,758
And yes, Begum Jaan,

1046
01:04:16,883 --> 01:04:20,133
my gramophone stopped working

1047
01:04:20,258 --> 01:04:22,341
so I couldn't bring it along.

1048
01:04:23,383 --> 01:04:27,675
And you know that

1049
01:04:28,675 --> 01:04:32,300
I can't do anything

1050
01:04:34,758 --> 01:04:36,466
until there's no music.

1051
01:04:37,258 --> 01:04:40,716
Your Highness, you're
our benefactor.

1052
01:04:41,175 --> 01:04:46,091
But I beg you, I cannot
do this any longer...

1053
01:04:46,633 --> 01:04:48,508
Don't delay.

1054
01:04:49,425 --> 01:04:51,425
Otherwise, it'll delay
my trip to Delhi.

1055
01:05:20,133 --> 01:05:25,883
"O bearer, slow the palanquin"

1056
01:05:26,216 --> 01:05:31,008
"and wait for a minute."

1057
01:05:32,258 --> 01:05:35,133
"Let me hug them tightly"

1058
01:05:35,258 --> 01:05:42,800
"and bless them from the
bottom of my heart."

1059
01:05:43,508 --> 01:05:46,800
"Your 'bindi' shimmers,
bangles clinker"

1060
01:05:46,925 --> 01:05:49,508
"and you're glowing
in the veil."

1061
01:05:49,633 --> 01:05:52,925
"May the kohl, the
flowers are lovely"

1062
01:05:53,050 --> 01:05:55,466
"and your courtyard's
covered in your fragrance."

1063
01:05:55,591 --> 01:05:58,925
"May your heart sway, when
your beloved kisses you"

1064
01:05:59,050 --> 01:06:01,591
"and your body and
heart are thrilled."

1065
01:06:01,716 --> 01:06:05,008
"May you be unharmed, untainted"

1066
01:06:05,133 --> 01:06:08,341
"and every inch of
your body glows."

1067
01:06:08,758 --> 01:06:15,133
"O bearer, slow the palanquin"

1068
01:06:27,216 --> 01:06:32,800
"I've laid the stars
on your pillow"

1069
01:06:33,383 --> 01:06:39,300
"while the moon sings for you."

1070
01:06:39,425 --> 01:06:45,341
"The beautiful night queen"

1071
01:06:45,466 --> 01:06:50,883
"sings lullabies
at your window."

1072
01:06:51,008 --> 01:06:54,050
"Sleep my dear,
sleep, my child."

1073
01:06:54,175 --> 01:06:57,633
"Disappear from my eyes."

1074
01:06:57,758 --> 01:07:03,341
"O dawn, don't wake me up yet."

1075
01:07:03,716 --> 01:07:08,425
"Wait a little longer."

1076
01:07:09,883 --> 01:07:15,675
"My slumber's incomplete
and so is my dream."

1077
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:21,008
"Let it be complete."

1078
01:07:21,133 --> 01:07:24,425
"Your 'bindi' shimmers,
bangles clinker"

1079
01:07:24,550 --> 01:07:27,091
"and you're glowing
in the veil."

1080
01:07:27,216 --> 01:07:30,633
"May the kohl, the
flowers are lovely"

1081
01:07:33,258 --> 01:07:35,341
"May your heart sway"

1082
01:07:37,591 --> 01:07:39,216
"are thrilled."

1083
01:07:39,341 --> 01:07:42,716
"May you be unharmed,
untainted..."

1084
01:07:55,216 --> 01:07:57,841
How are you, teacher?
- It's not good, Begum Jaan.

1085
01:07:58,091 --> 01:07:59,341
This is important.

1086
01:08:00,633 --> 01:08:04,175
Say it then. Your
lips are not sealed.

1087
01:08:04,633 --> 01:08:07,591
Not here, can we go
inside and talk?

1088
01:08:07,966 --> 01:08:09,800
You're too much, teacher.

1089
01:08:10,383 --> 01:08:13,550
By the way, even I
wanted to speak to you.

1090
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:15,383
About someone.

1091
01:08:15,675 --> 01:08:17,591
I'll go get some water.
- Come on.

1092
01:08:19,966 --> 01:08:21,591
So, should I...

1093
01:08:23,341 --> 01:08:25,883
What's wrong, teacher?

1094
01:08:28,841 --> 01:08:30,049
Listen, Begum Jaan.

1095
01:08:31,341 --> 01:08:32,883
I spoke to the party.

1096
01:08:33,674 --> 01:08:35,174
No pressure is going to work.

1097
01:08:37,424 --> 01:08:38,383
What do you mean?

1098
01:08:38,883 --> 01:08:40,716
You must obey the orders.

1099
01:08:42,383 --> 01:08:44,299
I think, you better
move out of here.

1100
01:08:45,549 --> 01:08:46,924
You don't know these people.

1101
01:08:47,424 --> 01:08:49,008
They can do anything under the
pretext of government orders.

1102
01:08:49,133 --> 01:08:50,549
What government, master?

1103
01:08:50,966 --> 01:08:52,424
I am the government around here.

1104
01:08:52,549 --> 01:08:55,341
Why don't you understand?
They'll attack you.

1105
01:08:55,466 --> 01:08:59,883
You're being very rude, teacher.

1106
01:09:00,841 --> 01:09:02,216
I'm not being rude, Begum.

1107
01:09:02,466 --> 01:09:04,216
I am worried for you.

1108
01:09:05,258 --> 01:09:07,424
Worried? For me?

1109
01:09:10,091 --> 01:09:11,758
Since when?

1110
01:09:12,716 --> 01:09:14,216
I was always worried for you

1111
01:09:14,591 --> 01:09:16,341
and I never got the
chance to express it.

1112
01:09:17,799 --> 01:09:18,758
But now I do.

1113
01:09:19,549 --> 01:09:21,966
The opportunity to
start a new life.

1114
01:09:22,924 --> 01:09:25,674
Listen. Quit all this.

1115
01:09:26,716 --> 01:09:29,299
This brothel, this
profession, this life.

1116
01:09:30,133 --> 01:09:31,299
And come with me.

1117
01:09:31,966 --> 01:09:33,383
Together we will... - We?

1118
01:10:02,841 --> 01:10:04,175
There's a difference
between sleeping together

1119
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:05,800
and abiding by each other.

1120
01:10:07,758 --> 01:10:10,508
Begum Jaan, I...
- You helped us a lot.

1121
01:10:11,716 --> 01:10:12,966
I thank you for that.

1122
01:10:13,550 --> 01:10:15,216
Had I known

1123
01:10:15,716 --> 01:10:18,091
your true intentions... - Begum!

1124
01:10:19,133 --> 01:10:21,508
Let me make one thing
clear, teacher.

1125
01:10:23,008 --> 01:10:25,341
Begum is beyond your grasp.

1126
01:10:25,675 --> 01:10:28,591
But I really...
- What nonsense, teacher!

1127
01:10:28,883 --> 01:10:32,841
Do you know there's someone who
can give her life for you?

1128
01:10:33,716 --> 01:10:36,216
I thought you wanted
to talk about her.

1129
01:10:36,966 --> 01:10:39,466
I don't understand
what you really want.

1130
01:10:40,466 --> 01:10:43,091
I want you.
- That's enough, teacher.

1131
01:10:44,091 --> 01:10:45,841
You were with us
during our good times

1132
01:10:45,966 --> 01:10:48,758
so I don't want to be the
reason for your bad luck.

1133
01:10:49,300 --> 01:10:51,216
Don't ever come back here again!

1134
01:10:52,383 --> 01:10:54,633
Begum Jaan, you're
assaulting a police officer.

1135
01:10:54,758 --> 01:10:55,925
Better think about this.

1136
01:10:56,300 --> 01:10:58,091
I only have your best
interests at heart.

1137
01:10:58,675 --> 01:11:00,508
You must vacate this brothel.

1138
01:11:01,591 --> 01:11:05,508
Yes, I'll see to it that you don't
face any problems after that.

1139
01:11:05,925 --> 01:11:08,550
Is this brothel your private
property that you'll evict us?

1140
01:11:09,258 --> 01:11:11,841
Or does your mother work here?
- You bitch!

1141
01:11:11,966 --> 01:11:13,133
Mind your tongue!

1142
01:11:13,925 --> 01:11:16,466
You're so stupid, Shyam Singh.

1143
01:11:17,133 --> 01:11:19,508
Doctors are called doctors,
lawyers as lawyers

1144
01:11:19,633 --> 01:11:21,300
and prostitutes are
called prostitutes.

1145
01:11:21,425 --> 01:11:23,091
That's not an abuse for us.

1146
01:11:23,466 --> 01:11:26,800
If you had called us a cop, then
that would've been an abuse to us.

1147
01:11:29,175 --> 01:11:30,133
Salim.

1148
01:11:36,716 --> 01:11:39,425
Those who are blessed
by the kings

1149
01:11:40,050 --> 01:11:42,758
don't need the pawns
to protect them.

1150
01:11:43,383 --> 01:11:44,633
Now get lost.

1151
01:11:46,050 --> 01:11:47,091
Get lost!

1152
01:11:53,008 --> 01:11:55,591
And then Begum Jaan
tried to seduce me.

1153
01:11:56,175 --> 01:11:58,091
When I said, I love Gulabo

1154
01:11:58,216 --> 01:11:59,133
she had me thrown
out of the house.

1155
01:11:59,258 --> 01:12:01,841
But Begum Jaan was saying that...
- You don't trust me.

1156
01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:06,716
I left my home and town
and fighting for you.

1157
01:12:08,008 --> 01:12:09,925
I even went against
the party's decision.

1158
01:12:12,425 --> 01:12:14,425
I keep thinking about
you every moment.

1159
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:21,716
In fact, I had to sneak
up here to meet you

1160
01:12:22,633 --> 01:12:24,216
and you don't trust me.

1161
01:13:01,050 --> 01:13:03,383
We went there with the
orders before, sir.

1162
01:13:05,050 --> 01:13:06,966
But Mirza and his dogs bit us.

1163
01:13:08,716 --> 01:13:10,841
This time, I even took
few constables along.

1164
01:13:11,258 --> 01:13:13,758
But the king's bodyguards
were already present there.

1165
01:13:15,258 --> 01:13:16,550
Begum said...

1166
01:13:16,883 --> 01:13:18,466
Next time she will kill us

1167
01:13:18,966 --> 01:13:20,841
and hang us at the
border's checkpoint.

1168
01:13:21,466 --> 01:13:22,966
How can she hang you?

1169
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:25,925
Not me, sir.

1170
01:13:26,466 --> 01:13:27,466
You.

1171
01:13:28,341 --> 01:13:29,466
The two of you.

1172
01:13:35,925 --> 01:13:38,008
You may leave. - Okay, sir.

1173
01:13:42,591 --> 01:13:44,258
If we don't get rid
of the brothel,

1174
01:13:45,466 --> 01:13:46,925
it will stall the
construction of the border.

1175
01:13:49,508 --> 01:13:51,466
The king's bodyguards are
also stationed there now.

1176
01:13:51,591 --> 01:13:55,466
Ilias, we must go to Sonapur.
- Why? What's out there?

1177
01:14:00,550 --> 01:14:02,508
The solution to this problem.

1178
01:14:04,758 --> 01:14:09,425
Not all jobs can be
done officially.

1179
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:12,716
There are some
unofficial employees

1180
01:14:13,758 --> 01:14:15,758
for certain matters.

1181
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:22,091
Did you understand?

1182
01:14:41,050 --> 01:14:42,050
Get up.

1183
01:14:45,216 --> 01:14:47,216
Who were you with?
- Don't worry.

1184
01:14:47,675 --> 01:14:49,675
It wasn't one of your
clients or your father.

1185
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:51,716
Hey bloody fool!

1186
01:14:53,216 --> 01:14:54,466
Don't drag my father into this!

1187
01:14:56,133 --> 01:14:58,508
Tell me, where did you go?

1188
01:14:58,758 --> 01:15:00,050
I won't tell you.

1189
01:15:00,883 --> 01:15:02,258
What will you do?

1190
01:15:03,925 --> 01:15:05,341
If Begum Jaan finds out

1191
01:15:05,675 --> 01:15:09,633
that you're in love with someone,
then she will skin you alive.

1192
01:15:11,133 --> 01:15:12,758
Bloody sycophant,

1193
01:15:14,091 --> 01:15:16,216
why are you always
licking her boots?

1194
01:15:18,008 --> 01:15:19,758
Bloody traitor.

1195
01:15:21,216 --> 01:15:23,466
Who saved you

1196
01:15:24,050 --> 01:15:26,175
when those wolves had
ganged up on you?

1197
01:15:26,508 --> 01:15:30,425
Rascal! How dare you slap me!
- Witch!

1198
01:15:30,716 --> 01:15:32,216
I will strangle you!

1199
01:15:32,341 --> 01:15:34,008
You conniving bitch!

1200
01:15:34,133 --> 01:15:36,841
You scheming bitch! - Bitch!

1201
01:15:37,133 --> 01:15:38,258
Come here!

1202
01:15:41,591 --> 01:15:43,758
You scheming bitch!

1203
01:15:44,133 --> 01:15:47,091
I will kill you. - Let go!

1204
01:15:47,216 --> 01:15:49,341
I'll strangle you.

1205
01:15:53,383 --> 01:15:54,258
Damn...

1206
01:16:03,841 --> 01:16:05,091
Why are you crying now?

1207
01:16:22,591 --> 01:16:25,216
What do you get
from this madness?

1208
01:16:26,383 --> 01:16:28,008
Begum Jaan took you in.

1209
01:16:29,175 --> 01:16:31,300
She will never hurt you.

1210
01:16:34,841 --> 01:16:36,925
"Looking at the
grinding stones,"

1211
01:16:38,550 --> 01:16:40,133
"Kabir is lamenting."

1212
01:16:41,633 --> 01:16:46,966
"In the duel of two wheels,
nothing remains safe."

1213
01:16:49,466 --> 01:16:51,966
Kabir Double-duty,
that's my name.

1214
01:16:53,425 --> 01:16:55,550
I can be Hindu or Muslim.

1215
01:16:56,466 --> 01:16:58,591
Thread around my neck
and circumcision too.

1216
01:16:59,466 --> 01:17:02,508
I carry the priest's cap and
the saint's hat as well.

1217
01:17:03,425 --> 01:17:07,175
I wouldn't know in which area
to create a riot and when.

1218
01:17:07,508 --> 01:17:12,383
But the boys are always
ready on both sides.

1219
01:17:13,508 --> 01:17:16,175
They all have one religion.
Money.

1220
01:17:17,383 --> 01:17:20,175
They get the job done
and you pay them.

1221
01:17:20,966 --> 01:17:22,925
Tell me whom to kill.

1222
01:17:24,258 --> 01:17:26,675
We want you to evict a manor.
- Brothel.

1223
01:17:27,216 --> 01:17:28,841
Yes, brothel.

1224
01:17:29,425 --> 01:17:32,341
One that's between
Dorangla and Sakkargarh.

1225
01:17:32,716 --> 01:17:33,925
That whorehouse?

1226
01:17:34,925 --> 01:17:37,341
Have you tried in
every way you could?

1227
01:17:38,050 --> 01:17:41,300
Because once Kabir's boys
get started on a job...

1228
01:17:42,133 --> 01:17:43,258
I hope you get it.

1229
01:17:44,591 --> 01:17:46,300
We've done what we could.

1230
01:17:46,425 --> 01:17:48,675
Now you must take care of it.
- Take care?

1231
01:17:48,925 --> 01:17:50,091
You mean, kill them?

1232
01:17:50,675 --> 01:17:54,966
Should I shoot them or stab
them or strangle them?

1233
01:17:55,508 --> 01:17:57,300
It's quite satisfying.

1234
01:17:58,008 --> 01:18:00,091
Or should we abduct
and rape them?

1235
01:18:00,383 --> 01:18:03,841
Or... Should we just hurt them?

1236
01:18:04,341 --> 01:18:06,216
Or I should use rods to
hit them at right places.

1237
01:18:06,341 --> 01:18:08,133
Every job has a different price.

1238
01:18:09,925 --> 01:18:11,675
Don't worry about the money.

1239
01:18:11,966 --> 01:18:15,425
But... I don't think we'll
need to do all that.

1240
01:18:17,008 --> 01:18:19,091
You'll have few men from the
police station, as well as guns.

1241
01:18:20,550 --> 01:18:22,341
Maybe by threatening
or scaring them.

1242
01:18:23,008 --> 01:18:25,008
Otherwise, shoot them.

1243
01:18:27,175 --> 01:18:28,300
Just shoot them.

1244
01:18:29,758 --> 01:18:34,008
Soap, powder, lentil, rice.
We're nearly out of everything.

1245
01:18:34,133 --> 01:18:36,175
This time, Lata will
go with Sujeet.

1246
01:18:37,841 --> 01:18:39,758
I won't carry those sacks alone.

1247
01:18:39,883 --> 01:18:41,091
You must come along.

1248
01:18:42,258 --> 01:18:45,008
I hardly get a square meal,
I have no strength left.

1249
01:18:45,383 --> 01:18:47,300
You know that I am a vegetarian.

1250
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:53,591
Lata, can't vegetarians
carry heavy burdens?

1251
01:18:55,258 --> 01:18:56,883
Cows, buffaloes, donkeys and elephants
- Enough.

1252
01:18:57,008 --> 01:18:58,675
are all vegetarians.

1253
01:19:01,133 --> 01:19:02,216
Let it be.

1254
01:19:02,966 --> 01:19:04,925
Don't try to educate
me about food

1255
01:19:05,050 --> 01:19:06,550
since you don't even know
where you come from.

1256
01:19:06,675 --> 01:19:09,716
Lowlife.
- Bitch. Don't comment on my caste.

1257
01:19:10,091 --> 01:19:11,216
At least, we don't
throw our women

1258
01:19:11,341 --> 01:19:13,508
onto the same pyre as
their dead husband.

1259
01:19:13,633 --> 01:19:16,508
Did you forget how you came
here running, half burnt?

1260
01:19:16,633 --> 01:19:18,550
You bloody mother...
- Scumbag...

1261
01:19:18,675 --> 01:19:20,550
I will pull your tongue out.

1262
01:19:20,675 --> 01:19:22,633
I'll break your jaw...
- Stop fighting.

1263
01:19:22,758 --> 01:19:23,966
Or you won't get to eat.

1264
01:19:24,091 --> 01:19:25,050
Jamila. - Yes.

1265
01:19:25,175 --> 01:19:27,383
Get the meat which the
villagers sent. Hurry.

1266
01:19:27,508 --> 01:19:29,925
Why do you always fight
with Amba over caste?

1267
01:19:30,050 --> 01:19:31,466
I've kept it right there.
You can easily see it.

1268
01:19:31,591 --> 01:19:32,925
Jamila. - Yes, Begum Jaan.

1269
01:19:33,050 --> 01:19:34,550
The lentil gruel was delicious.

1270
01:19:35,508 --> 01:19:37,425
Would you like some
more, Begum Jaan?

1271
01:19:38,466 --> 01:19:41,633
Uncle Salim. Why don't you
teach us how to fire a gun?

1272
01:19:41,925 --> 01:19:44,425
Your cop friends left
their guns here last year

1273
01:19:44,550 --> 01:19:46,383
and they are just
rusting out here.

1274
01:19:46,508 --> 01:19:48,550
Take Begum Jaan's permission,
and I'll teach you.

1275
01:19:49,050 --> 01:19:52,008
Begum Jaan, why don't
you say something?

1276
01:19:53,133 --> 01:19:57,216
Silly girl, we're under the
protection of the king.

1277
01:19:57,341 --> 01:19:59,800
As long as he's alive, you
don't have to use the gun.

1278
01:19:59,925 --> 01:20:01,091
Postman.

1279
01:20:01,425 --> 01:20:02,216
Letter.

1280
01:20:02,341 --> 01:20:03,841
Jamila. Go check.

1281
01:20:06,966 --> 01:20:08,300
That was delicious. - Onions?

1282
01:20:08,425 --> 01:20:09,466
It's been really long since

1283
01:20:09,591 --> 01:20:12,800
Jamila made her famous oat bran.

1284
01:20:13,133 --> 01:20:14,175
Sujeet, give me some water.

1285
01:20:15,175 --> 01:20:16,175
Here you go.

1286
01:20:16,300 --> 01:20:17,341
Give me some onions.

1287
01:20:20,091 --> 01:20:21,300
Here. - Take it.

1288
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:27,841
What happened?

1289
01:20:27,966 --> 01:20:29,216
Begum Jaan.

1290
01:20:29,341 --> 01:20:30,758
Begum Jaan. - What happened?

1291
01:20:30,883 --> 01:20:32,383
Watch it! - What happened?

1292
01:20:32,508 --> 01:20:34,550
Someone tell me,
what's happening?

1293
01:20:34,675 --> 01:20:36,300
Rascals. - What happened?

1294
01:20:36,925 --> 01:20:38,216
Uncle Salim.

1295
01:20:39,925 --> 01:20:40,925
Begum Jaan!

1296
01:20:41,050 --> 01:20:42,466
Salim!

1297
01:20:49,425 --> 01:20:51,258
Greetings, Begum Jaan.

1298
01:20:51,383 --> 01:20:53,925
I hope you all liked
the meat today.

1299
01:20:54,050 --> 01:20:55,758
Wasn't it nice?

1300
01:20:55,883 --> 01:20:58,341
I knew right away

1301
01:20:58,466 --> 01:21:00,633
that Shekhu's full of meat.

1302
01:21:02,383 --> 01:21:05,966
I don't know how spicy
you like your meat.

1303
01:21:07,216 --> 01:21:08,883
So I cooked it according
to my preference.

1304
01:21:09,758 --> 01:21:12,341
But I left Bhaloo for you guys.

1305
01:21:12,466 --> 01:21:15,550
You can cook him like you want.

1306
01:21:17,175 --> 01:21:19,383
One more thing, Begum Jaan.

1307
01:21:19,508 --> 01:21:21,925
You must vacate
this brothel now.

1308
01:21:22,550 --> 01:21:24,758
After all, there are going
to be two countries.

1309
01:21:24,883 --> 01:21:28,341
So you must make a
sacrifice, like Shekhu.

1310
01:21:28,466 --> 01:21:30,175
Peace be upon you.

1311
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:31,716
Yours Kabir.

1312
01:21:31,841 --> 01:21:32,716
No, Salim...

1313
01:21:32,841 --> 01:21:35,550
Salim, no... - Brother Salim!

1314
01:21:35,675 --> 01:21:38,133
It was my responsibility
to protect the children!

1315
01:21:38,258 --> 01:21:39,216
Brother Salim!

1316
01:21:39,341 --> 01:21:41,716
It was my responsibility
to protect the children!

1317
01:21:41,841 --> 01:21:42,633
Brother Salim!

1318
01:21:42,758 --> 01:21:46,175
It was my responsibility
to protect the children!

1319
01:21:46,300 --> 01:21:47,758
He is a butcher.

1320
01:21:47,883 --> 01:21:49,091
It was mine!

1321
01:21:50,383 --> 01:21:51,550
It was mine!

1322
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:56,966
Will Kabir stay quiet
after threatening them?

1323
01:22:03,383 --> 01:22:06,633
Can't we reason with the king
to drive Begum Jaan away?

1324
01:22:06,758 --> 01:22:07,966
It won't make a difference.

1325
01:22:09,258 --> 01:22:11,300
Do you think that
a century later

1326
01:22:11,425 --> 01:22:14,591
when the children would
read about the partition

1327
01:22:14,716 --> 01:22:17,466
it would have stories about
you, me or Begum Jaan?

1328
01:22:18,466 --> 01:22:20,591
Who talks about
pawns in history?

1329
01:22:22,091 --> 01:22:25,091
They only talk about emperors.

1330
01:22:27,758 --> 01:22:29,758
But I am not talking
about a century later.

1331
01:22:31,008 --> 01:22:32,966
I am talking about this time.
Now.

1332
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:36,383
Ilias is in agony.

1333
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:39,508
Yes, Ilias is in agony for
a bunch of prostitutes.

1334
01:22:40,216 --> 01:22:41,216
Isn't that what you mean?

1335
01:22:41,341 --> 01:22:42,675
Ilias.

1336
01:22:45,883 --> 01:22:49,175
In order to destroy
Begum Jaan's brothel,

1337
01:22:49,300 --> 01:22:52,133
we won't have to give a
speech or cause a riot.

1338
01:22:52,258 --> 01:22:53,925
At least, in these two areas.

1339
01:22:54,758 --> 01:22:58,758
In order to save countless lives

1340
01:23:00,175 --> 01:23:02,175
we'll have to
sacrifice some lives.

1341
01:23:02,675 --> 01:23:05,758
Consider that it's Eid today.

1342
01:23:08,050 --> 01:23:09,008
Bakra-Eid.

1343
01:23:23,216 --> 01:23:24,925
Bunch of cowards!

1344
01:23:25,050 --> 01:23:26,591
Butchering speechless animals!

1345
01:23:27,008 --> 01:23:28,383
Cowards!

1346
01:23:28,508 --> 01:23:31,175
I will skin them alive,
make a whip out of it

1347
01:23:31,300 --> 01:23:32,550
and flog them with it.

1348
01:23:32,675 --> 01:23:35,341
Promise me, you
won't spare them.

1349
01:23:37,883 --> 01:23:39,966
I raised them since
they were pups...

1350
01:23:41,341 --> 01:23:43,133
In rain, in winter.

1351
01:23:43,925 --> 01:23:46,008
I would wipe their bodies
and feed them milk...

1352
01:23:48,300 --> 01:23:49,716
What's wrong with your throat?

1353
01:23:49,841 --> 01:23:52,841
Shekhu's hair. It's
stuck in my throat.

1354
01:23:54,591 --> 01:23:56,383
It's just your imagination.

1355
01:23:56,508 --> 01:23:59,300
No, it's there, it's there.

1356
01:24:00,050 --> 01:24:01,966
I can't even swallow it.

1357
01:24:03,508 --> 01:24:06,258
"While leaving the
city of Lucknow"

1358
01:24:08,175 --> 01:24:10,758
"don't ask about my plight."

1359
01:24:12,050 --> 01:24:13,091
Begum.

1360
01:24:13,883 --> 01:24:18,050
I think, you must all leave too.

1361
01:24:19,258 --> 01:24:20,258
What?

1362
01:24:22,300 --> 01:24:23,925
Times are changing.

1363
01:24:27,341 --> 01:24:30,675
I went to Delhi.

1364
01:24:32,925 --> 01:24:35,716
Everything will be over soon.

1365
01:24:36,633 --> 01:24:39,633
I don't understand what
you're trying to say.

1366
01:24:39,758 --> 01:24:41,633
Even the king of
Junagarh was in Delhi.

1367
01:24:43,091 --> 01:24:44,758
Kashmir and Hyderabad
have been told that

1368
01:24:44,883 --> 01:24:48,591
they must choose a side
they want to live in.

1369
01:24:51,258 --> 01:24:52,300
So...

1370
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:55,800
What does that mean?

1371
01:24:56,383 --> 01:24:58,341
Kings will always remain kings.

1372
01:24:59,091 --> 01:25:02,216
Whether it's in India or...
What's it called?

1373
01:25:02,341 --> 01:25:04,091
Pakistan... - Begum Jaan,

1374
01:25:05,008 --> 01:25:07,550
kings are not the
rulers anymore.

1375
01:25:10,966 --> 01:25:12,883
The people will
be the kings now.

1376
01:25:15,675 --> 01:25:17,966
Delhi and Karachi
have only one motive.

1377
01:25:18,091 --> 01:25:20,758
In a couple of years, all
the kingdoms and estates

1378
01:25:20,883 --> 01:25:22,258
will belong to the government.

1379
01:25:25,300 --> 01:25:26,300
And you?

1380
01:25:29,175 --> 01:25:31,091
We'll be mere pawns.

1381
01:25:32,841 --> 01:25:35,258
You know the royal
treasure is almost empty.

1382
01:25:36,466 --> 01:25:39,883
People are leaving and we
have to sell some stuff.

1383
01:25:40,466 --> 01:25:43,008
We're also facing
many legal cases.

1384
01:25:44,050 --> 01:25:45,091
So now?

1385
01:25:52,008 --> 01:25:56,591
Begum... listen to
the government.

1386
01:25:57,133 --> 01:25:58,966
Leave this brothel.

1387
01:26:02,300 --> 01:26:06,841
I cannot... protect you anymore.

1388
01:26:18,425 --> 01:26:20,758
Well, I don't think anything's
in your control anymore.

1389
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:25,466
Even if I sing today, you
won't be able to do anything.

1390
01:26:25,591 --> 01:26:27,133
Begum! - Salim!

1391
01:26:31,341 --> 01:26:32,425
Yes, Begum Jaan.

1392
01:26:32,883 --> 01:26:36,175
Salim, the king is very tired.

1393
01:26:36,675 --> 01:26:38,050
Take him to his room.

1394
01:26:38,508 --> 01:26:40,008
He needs rest.

1395
01:26:40,508 --> 01:26:43,716
And he'll be leaving soon, so
make all the arrangements.

1396
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:47,800
You'll die a terrible
death, Begum.

1397
01:26:49,841 --> 01:26:54,258
Whatever! I'll die like a
queen, and not a beggar.

1398
01:26:54,883 --> 01:26:56,175
In my palace.

1399
01:26:57,966 --> 01:27:04,508
"You sneak up to my doorstep."

1400
01:27:04,758 --> 01:27:11,425
"My heart bleeds and my
heartbeat full of desolation."

1401
01:27:11,550 --> 01:27:18,091
"My heart bleeds and my
heartbeat full of desolation."

1402
01:27:18,466 --> 01:27:25,091
"I dabbed soothing
turmeric on your wounds"

1403
01:27:25,383 --> 01:27:31,925
"and opened up my
wounds along the way."

1404
01:27:32,175 --> 01:27:35,300
"What has happened?"

1405
01:27:35,633 --> 01:27:42,300
"I fell so deeply
in love with you."

1406
01:27:42,550 --> 01:27:48,925
"The old memories were
refreshed again."

1407
01:27:49,258 --> 01:27:52,466
"What has happened?"

1408
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:56,758
"I fell so deeply..."

1409
01:27:58,841 --> 01:28:01,133
You're learning how to fire
a gun, not washing clothes.

1410
01:28:01,258 --> 01:28:02,258
Hold it properly.

1411
01:28:02,841 --> 01:28:03,758
Hold it.

1412
01:28:05,841 --> 01:28:06,966
Bravo, Rubina.

1413
01:28:10,716 --> 01:28:11,758
You're fine.

1414
01:28:12,508 --> 01:28:13,550
Nice.

1415
01:28:16,966 --> 01:28:19,216
This bitch is very heavy, Salim.

1416
01:28:19,550 --> 01:28:22,341
My dagger's much better.
- Don't joke, Begum Jaan.

1417
01:28:22,758 --> 01:28:24,758
Shoulder straight,
strong grip, clear view.

1418
01:28:25,716 --> 01:28:26,633
Come on.

1419
01:28:27,216 --> 01:28:28,383
Pull it back.

1420
01:28:32,216 --> 01:28:35,008
Kicks back like a bloody horse!
- Careful.

1421
01:28:38,633 --> 01:28:39,716
Bravo.

1422
01:28:42,133 --> 01:28:43,258
Nice.

1423
01:28:51,925 --> 01:28:52,883
Good one.

1424
01:28:56,966 --> 01:28:59,716
If Begum Jaan finds
out Laadli's with us

1425
01:28:59,841 --> 01:29:01,550
she will skin us all alive.

1426
01:29:01,675 --> 01:29:02,675
What can I do?

1427
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:04,133
Jamila said to take her out,

1428
01:29:04,258 --> 01:29:07,300
she was feeling very
lonely in the house.

1429
01:29:07,425 --> 01:29:08,508
If she says anything, then
you'll have to handle her.

1430
01:29:08,633 --> 01:29:11,050
Ever since Shekhu-Bhaloo died

1431
01:29:11,550 --> 01:29:14,008
the place seems
like a graveyard.

1432
01:29:14,758 --> 01:29:16,258
Hurry up, it will
be sunset soon.

1433
01:29:16,383 --> 01:29:17,675
Can't we take this?

1434
01:29:18,675 --> 01:29:20,133
Show me this one.

1435
01:29:21,050 --> 01:29:23,341
How much for the tomatoes?
- Two annas.

1436
01:29:38,383 --> 01:29:40,258
Like this. Pull it back. Push.

1437
01:29:40,383 --> 01:29:42,466
You have to push it
with your might.

1438
01:29:42,591 --> 01:29:44,175
Take aim.
- Load the bullet like this.

1439
01:29:44,300 --> 01:29:45,841
Push it forward.

1440
01:29:46,425 --> 01:29:48,425
Pull it back. - Like this.

1441
01:29:54,383 --> 01:29:55,716
Begum Jaan!

1442
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:59,008
Begum Jaan! - Gulabo.

1443
01:30:05,966 --> 01:30:07,133
This is how you load a bullet.

1444
01:30:07,258 --> 01:30:09,258
Like this. - Push this...

1445
01:30:10,258 --> 01:30:12,841
Bravo, Gulabo.

1446
01:30:13,300 --> 01:30:14,341
Great.

1447
01:30:14,466 --> 01:30:15,716
We got everything.

1448
01:30:16,966 --> 01:30:18,050
Laadli, did you have fun?

1449
01:30:18,175 --> 01:30:19,633
Yes, she is tired.

1450
01:30:24,216 --> 01:30:26,050
Hurry up. - What happened?

1451
01:30:26,425 --> 01:30:27,258
Walk faster.

1452
01:30:27,383 --> 01:30:28,466
What happened?

1453
01:30:30,175 --> 01:30:31,508
What's wrong?

1454
01:30:32,925 --> 01:30:34,633
Walk faster. Walk faster.

1455
01:30:35,425 --> 01:30:37,341
Walk faster. Walk faster.
- But what happened?

1456
01:30:37,466 --> 01:30:39,133
What's wrong?
- Don't look back. Just walk faster.

1457
01:30:39,258 --> 01:30:41,133
Walk... - What happened?

1458
01:30:41,258 --> 01:30:42,550
Run! Run!

1459
01:30:42,675 --> 01:30:44,383
Run, Laadli. - Run.

1460
01:30:48,675 --> 01:30:50,591
Come on. - Sujeet.

1461
01:30:54,133 --> 01:30:55,175
Come on.

1462
01:30:55,800 --> 01:30:57,341
Run. - Come on.

1463
01:31:00,175 --> 01:31:02,591
Come on. - Let me go!

1464
01:31:04,050 --> 01:31:05,966
Come on, hurry up! Hurry up.

1465
01:31:19,466 --> 01:31:20,675
Hurry.

1466
01:31:22,091 --> 01:31:24,008
What happened? - Hide.

1467
01:31:24,675 --> 01:31:26,133
Come on.

1468
01:31:39,050 --> 01:31:40,883
Quiet. Hush.

1469
01:31:46,675 --> 01:31:48,383
This way... Come on.

1470
01:31:50,925 --> 01:31:51,925
Come on.

1471
01:31:59,925 --> 01:32:01,425
Come here.

1472
01:32:13,175 --> 01:32:14,591
Sit! Sit down.

1473
01:32:17,383 --> 01:32:18,425
Be quiet.

1474
01:32:21,258 --> 01:32:23,591
Are... are they
going to kill us?

1475
01:32:24,091 --> 01:32:26,383
Listen, I think
they went that way.

1476
01:32:26,508 --> 01:32:28,633
There's a lane up ahead.
Let's get out through there.

1477
01:32:28,758 --> 01:32:31,050
No, they went that way.

1478
01:32:31,175 --> 01:32:34,050
So you go this way.
- Leaving you alone?

1479
01:32:34,175 --> 01:32:35,841
I would rather die
than leave you alone.

1480
01:32:35,966 --> 01:32:38,175
Stop arguing, just do as I said.

1481
01:32:38,300 --> 01:32:41,008
Go or else I'll die.

1482
01:32:41,341 --> 01:32:43,508
I told you we
shouldn't come here.

1483
01:32:43,633 --> 01:32:45,341
Now, these people will kill us.

1484
01:32:46,050 --> 01:32:48,091
Will you shut up? Always crying.

1485
01:33:09,925 --> 01:33:12,341
Come on. Come on.

1486
01:33:13,300 --> 01:33:16,300
Let me go. Let me go.

1487
01:33:17,008 --> 01:33:18,633
Sujeet... - I beg you.

1488
01:33:18,758 --> 01:33:20,800
I am just a kid, I
haven't done anything.

1489
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:24,383
Rubina, let's go.
- I told you that I won't go.

1490
01:33:24,508 --> 01:33:26,341
But no one ever listens to me.

1491
01:33:27,008 --> 01:33:30,133
Listen, brother, I have
nothing to do with them.

1492
01:33:30,258 --> 01:33:31,425
Let me go.

1493
01:33:41,508 --> 01:33:45,633
Why did you send
me away forever?

1494
01:33:48,883 --> 01:33:51,841
What will Ruby do without you?

1495
01:33:52,966 --> 01:33:54,008
Tell me.

1496
01:33:56,716 --> 01:33:59,008
Don't you want to settle down?

1497
01:34:01,800 --> 01:34:03,300
Don't go, Sujeet.

1498
01:34:05,091 --> 01:34:06,258
Don't go.

1499
01:34:09,175 --> 01:34:13,425
I... love you.

1500
01:34:17,466 --> 01:34:18,716
I love you!

1501
01:34:25,966 --> 01:34:27,300
I love you!

1502
01:35:42,675 --> 01:35:44,425
I opened this brothel.

1503
01:35:45,466 --> 01:35:47,758
And all of you came
here one after another.

1504
01:35:47,883 --> 01:35:50,758
You got work and our
business flourished.

1505
01:35:52,633 --> 01:35:55,008
Lata, remember?

1506
01:35:55,591 --> 01:35:57,383
You weren't agreeing.

1507
01:35:59,050 --> 01:36:00,341
I remember, Begum Jaan.

1508
01:36:01,633 --> 01:36:03,383
I also remember your dagger.

1509
01:36:05,466 --> 01:36:08,633
And Rani. Hiding
behind your veil.

1510
01:36:09,550 --> 01:36:13,300
You were scared out of your wits when
you saw blood for the first time.

1511
01:36:14,300 --> 01:36:15,675
Begum Jaan, you're too much.

1512
01:36:15,800 --> 01:36:18,883
Of course, you've grown up now.
Feeling embarrassed.

1513
01:36:22,050 --> 01:36:26,216
And Maina-Amba. I had to pay
a high price for you two.

1514
01:36:26,508 --> 01:36:28,425
Almost emptied my purse.

1515
01:36:31,425 --> 01:36:33,341
That was one stormy night.

1516
01:36:35,550 --> 01:36:39,091
Covered in fever, these two
were blabbering all the time.

1517
01:36:39,216 --> 01:36:40,925
That's nothing new.

1518
01:36:41,050 --> 01:36:44,466
These two still
blabber all the time.

1519
01:36:45,383 --> 01:36:46,966
Blabbermouths of this brothel.

1520
01:36:47,300 --> 01:36:51,091
Jamila, this isn't a brothel.

1521
01:36:52,300 --> 01:36:53,425
It's our home.

1522
01:36:55,925 --> 01:37:00,133
We never got so much
freedom in our own home.

1523
01:37:00,550 --> 01:37:01,508
Freedom.

1524
01:37:03,258 --> 01:37:05,091
Nonsense.

1525
01:37:07,216 --> 01:37:12,425
These two countries are playing
the game of independence

1526
01:37:13,091 --> 01:37:15,716
and so we must move
out of our home.

1527
01:37:18,175 --> 01:37:21,550
Our home, our land.

1528
01:37:24,008 --> 01:37:26,425
The place from where
I left as a bride

1529
01:37:29,216 --> 01:37:31,091
and returned as a courtesan.

1530
01:37:34,175 --> 01:37:37,258
I even marked a place
for my burial.

1531
01:37:40,050 --> 01:37:41,300
There...

1532
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:47,508
For years, I sold my flesh.

1533
01:37:49,300 --> 01:37:52,091
I never imagined my brothel
will be broken into two.

1534
01:37:56,008 --> 01:37:57,758
Our bodies will be partitioned.

1535
01:38:02,383 --> 01:38:06,008
Bloody rascals! I am not
going to leave this house.

1536
01:38:06,675 --> 01:38:10,550
I don't need a man! I can
protect this place alone.

1537
01:38:13,008 --> 01:38:16,550
But you must leave! The rest
of you, you must leave.

1538
01:38:16,675 --> 01:38:17,758
Leave.

1539
01:38:17,883 --> 01:38:19,258
Go where? You think our
families will take us back.

1540
01:38:19,383 --> 01:38:20,925
They have even
forgotten our names.

1541
01:38:21,883 --> 01:38:23,675
And those villagers!

1542
01:38:24,383 --> 01:38:25,425
Those priests.

1543
01:38:26,050 --> 01:38:28,508
During the day, they will
stay away from my shadows.

1544
01:38:28,633 --> 01:38:30,925
And at night, they
will screw me!

1545
01:38:32,050 --> 01:38:33,258
You're a woman, too.

1546
01:38:33,675 --> 01:38:37,133
You know very well whether
it's a queen or a whore.

1547
01:38:37,258 --> 01:38:40,550
It's always the men who are in control.
- Amba, why don't you understand?

1548
01:38:40,925 --> 01:38:43,675
There's nothing left to
understand, Begum Jaan.

1549
01:38:46,341 --> 01:38:49,133
They sliced dear Sujeet
into four pieces.

1550
01:38:51,216 --> 01:38:54,800
We won't leave till
we finish this war.

1551
01:38:54,925 --> 01:38:57,841
Yes, Begum. This brothel
belongs to us as well.

1552
01:38:58,383 --> 01:39:01,258
Now if we leave,
then what about you?

1553
01:39:02,258 --> 01:39:03,383
Do you remember?

1554
01:39:04,300 --> 01:39:08,050
So it's best that we all stay
here and fight our battles.

1555
01:39:08,175 --> 01:39:09,216
She is right.

1556
01:39:12,216 --> 01:39:16,216
But we must get Laadli and Shabnam
out of here, at any cost.

1557
01:39:16,591 --> 01:39:17,716
And you too, auntie.

1558
01:39:18,633 --> 01:39:21,508
The son I gave birth to

1559
01:39:22,883 --> 01:39:26,508
left me at the banks of
Benares, helpless and alone.

1560
01:39:26,633 --> 01:39:27,841
Auntie.

1561
01:39:27,966 --> 01:39:28,883
Don't rake up the past.

1562
01:39:29,008 --> 01:39:31,716
Dear, it was you who helped me.

1563
01:39:32,508 --> 01:39:34,175
You held my hand.

1564
01:39:35,133 --> 01:39:37,300
Do you want to throw me out now?

1565
01:39:37,425 --> 01:39:40,341
Fine. There's no point
in arguing with you.

1566
01:39:41,841 --> 01:39:45,466
But Shabnam and Laadli must leave...
- Laadli won't go anywhere.

1567
01:39:46,883 --> 01:39:48,216
She will stay here.

1568
01:39:49,258 --> 01:39:50,841
This is her home too.

1569
01:39:51,925 --> 01:39:53,966
She was born here, Begum Jaan.

1570
01:39:54,091 --> 01:39:58,716
And that's why...
- She is your child too.

1571
01:39:59,925 --> 01:40:02,008
All of you raised her together.

1572
01:40:03,716 --> 01:40:08,966
So we'll all go with
Laadli, or no one goes.

1573
01:40:09,091 --> 01:40:12,258
Jamila...
- I've made up my mind, that's it.

1574
01:40:14,133 --> 01:40:16,258
Why are you all so stubborn?

1575
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:20,425
You don't understand.

1576
01:40:26,633 --> 01:40:27,591
Okay, listen.

1577
01:40:29,133 --> 01:40:31,133
Until the situation
doesn't get better,

1578
01:40:31,633 --> 01:40:34,425
take both of them to
Guruji in Lucknow.

1579
01:40:34,550 --> 01:40:36,008
I won't go... - Listen to me.

1580
01:40:37,258 --> 01:40:39,508
This place is not safe
for children anymore.

1581
01:41:08,925 --> 01:41:09,966
Gulabo, hurry up!

1582
01:41:10,091 --> 01:41:11,258
Gulabo, hurry up!

1583
01:41:49,508 --> 01:41:51,633
Did you write everything in
the letter to Begum Jaan?

1584
01:41:51,758 --> 01:41:53,841
Yes. Everything.

1585
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:56,216
I left nothing.

1586
01:41:57,216 --> 01:41:58,216
Let's go.

1587
01:41:58,758 --> 01:42:00,050
There are some things left.

1588
01:42:03,633 --> 01:42:05,258
Might as well finish that too.

1589
01:42:10,466 --> 01:42:11,550
In the letter,

1590
01:42:13,466 --> 01:42:15,925
you only wrote about buyers,

1591
01:42:16,800 --> 01:42:20,758
business, teacher, atrocity.

1592
01:42:23,175 --> 01:42:27,716
But not about how you were almost dead
and how I nursed you back to health.

1593
01:42:30,133 --> 01:42:32,008
You haven't written
a word about it.

1594
01:42:33,925 --> 01:42:40,800
Nor about how I massaged you all
night when you were pregnant.

1595
01:42:42,675 --> 01:42:44,341
You didn't mention that either.

1596
01:42:47,466 --> 01:42:49,383
Talking for months.

1597
01:42:50,675 --> 01:42:53,550
I stopped you from committing
suicide four times.

1598
01:42:57,883 --> 01:43:00,300
You forgot to write a lot
of things in the letter.

1599
01:43:02,050 --> 01:43:06,758
Feeding a goat at the butcher's
shop is just feeding him

1600
01:43:07,091 --> 01:43:08,050
and not love.

1601
01:43:08,175 --> 01:43:10,466
You bloody traitor! - Salim.

1602
01:43:16,133 --> 01:43:17,633
She has grown up now.

1603
01:43:20,425 --> 01:43:21,425
Let her go.

1604
01:44:29,925 --> 01:44:31,883
Salim. Something doesn't feel right.
- Yes, Begum Jaan.

1605
01:44:32,008 --> 01:44:33,008
Me too.

1606
01:44:33,133 --> 01:44:34,758
Are the guns ready?
- Of course, Begum Jaan.

1607
01:44:34,883 --> 01:44:36,466
And the ammunitions?
- They are all ready.

1608
01:44:36,925 --> 01:44:38,216
Let's wake up everyone.

1609
01:44:38,841 --> 01:44:42,508
Jamila. Rubina. Auntie.

1610
01:44:48,550 --> 01:44:49,550
Hurry up.

1611
01:44:52,425 --> 01:44:54,841
Leave now! There's
danger on the way.

1612
01:44:58,633 --> 01:44:59,883
Forgive me, Gulabo,

1613
01:45:00,008 --> 01:45:03,633
but I want to see that
arrogant Begum Jaan die twice.

1614
01:45:05,633 --> 01:45:10,425
Once... when you betrayed her.

1615
01:45:12,300 --> 01:45:15,425
And now when she will
actually get shot.

1616
01:45:17,508 --> 01:45:20,966
But... marriage?

1617
01:45:25,216 --> 01:45:31,466
Gulabo, prostitutes only
have buyers, not husbands.

1618
01:46:06,883 --> 01:46:07,925
Auntie.

1619
01:46:23,466 --> 01:46:25,758
Jamila, leave immediately
with these two.

1620
01:46:26,175 --> 01:46:28,466
I won't go anywhere.
- What do you mean?

1621
01:46:28,591 --> 01:46:31,008
It was decided yesterday that you'd
go to Lucknow with these two.

1622
01:46:31,133 --> 01:46:32,300
I won't go anywhere.

1623
01:46:32,425 --> 01:46:33,966
I won't leave all of you
alone in this situation.

1624
01:46:34,091 --> 01:46:37,133
Begum Jaan asked
you to leave now.

1625
01:46:37,258 --> 01:46:39,175
We are not her mothers, but
we do have a right over her.

1626
01:46:39,300 --> 01:46:41,133
I will leave with all of you.
- Quiet.

1627
01:46:41,258 --> 01:46:43,466
Jamila, stop arguing and leave.

1628
01:46:43,591 --> 01:46:46,341
Begum Jaan, this
is my fight too.

1629
01:46:46,466 --> 01:46:48,716
Enough. Quiet.
- I won't abandon all of you.

1630
01:46:48,841 --> 01:46:51,175
Jamila, this is
no time to argue.

1631
01:46:51,300 --> 01:46:53,466
Leave now with Laadli and
Shabnam through the back door.

1632
01:46:53,591 --> 01:46:54,841
We can be attacked at any time.

1633
01:46:55,633 --> 01:46:56,633
Salim.

1634
01:46:56,758 --> 01:46:58,425
Motherfucker!

1635
01:46:58,550 --> 01:47:00,258
Everyone, get in position.

1636
01:47:01,425 --> 01:47:03,716
Auntie, get out of here!

1637
01:47:03,841 --> 01:47:05,591
Aim properly, guys.

1638
01:47:05,716 --> 01:47:07,633
Rubina. - Salim, careful.

1639
01:47:08,841 --> 01:47:10,008
Careful!

1640
01:47:11,591 --> 01:47:14,466
Is she your wife? Shoot them!

1641
01:47:24,966 --> 01:47:27,050
They only have a
handful of guns.

1642
01:47:27,508 --> 01:47:28,841
Shoot them.

1643
01:47:31,008 --> 01:47:35,133
Useless! All of you go and mix
up with those prostitutes.

1644
01:47:54,591 --> 01:47:56,091
Damn!

1645
01:48:22,133 --> 01:48:24,258
Maina! - Maina.

1646
01:48:24,675 --> 01:48:26,800
Scumbags! They shot
her in the back.

1647
01:48:27,216 --> 01:48:28,800
Bloody rascals.

1648
01:48:29,883 --> 01:48:31,758
Come on, guys. Hurry up.

1649
01:48:32,216 --> 01:48:33,675
Come on, get down.

1650
01:48:33,966 --> 01:48:35,925
Get this over with quickly.

1651
01:48:38,925 --> 01:48:40,133
Rani, be careful!

1652
01:48:43,258 --> 01:48:44,966
Bloody rascals!

1653
01:48:46,300 --> 01:48:50,133
Bloody rascals!

1654
01:48:59,175 --> 01:49:00,591
Lata!

1655
01:49:03,008 --> 01:49:06,008
Bloody lowlife!

1656
01:49:20,258 --> 01:49:22,300
What's the hurry?

1657
01:50:19,591 --> 01:50:20,758
Hey!

1658
01:50:21,550 --> 01:50:22,758
Hey!

1659
01:50:24,258 --> 01:50:25,300
Hey!

1660
01:50:26,841 --> 01:50:28,008
Stop it!

1661
01:50:28,383 --> 01:50:32,050
Ask her to stop it!
Ask her to stop!

1662
01:50:33,591 --> 01:50:34,550
Stop it!

1663
01:50:34,675 --> 01:50:36,758
She is like a daughter to me.
Ask her to stop.

1664
01:50:36,883 --> 01:50:39,466
It was a mistake. Mistake!

1665
01:50:39,591 --> 01:50:41,133
Look at me. I made a mistake.

1666
01:50:41,258 --> 01:50:44,008
I made a mistake. Stop.

1667
01:50:44,633 --> 01:50:47,383
Hey... Let them go.

1668
01:50:47,508 --> 01:50:50,258
Let them go! Let them go!

1669
01:50:50,591 --> 01:50:53,758
Dear, please put your
clothes back on.

1670
01:50:57,633 --> 01:50:59,425
Please forgive me.

1671
01:51:44,383 --> 01:51:46,258
Dear Lord...

1672
01:52:09,300 --> 01:52:11,550
Prostitutes might
not have husbands.

1673
01:52:12,425 --> 01:52:14,216
But they do have daughters.

1674
01:52:39,800 --> 01:52:40,800
Begum Jaan.

1675
01:52:43,925 --> 01:52:44,925
Salim.

1676
01:52:46,508 --> 01:52:47,633
I can't see anything.

1677
01:52:47,758 --> 01:52:48,800
It's all quiet.

1678
01:52:49,758 --> 01:52:50,925
Amba. - Yes.

1679
01:52:51,050 --> 01:52:52,133
Come.

1680
01:52:53,883 --> 01:52:56,841
Amba, careful.

1681
01:53:00,341 --> 01:53:02,050
Welcome.

1682
01:53:02,175 --> 01:53:03,800
We were waiting for you.

1683
01:53:04,341 --> 01:53:07,216
Kabir, when did this happen?

1684
01:53:08,091 --> 01:53:11,758
Sir, accidents can
be unpredictable.

1685
01:53:23,716 --> 01:53:24,675
Begum Jaan.

1686
01:53:56,966 --> 01:53:58,300
Let's go.

1687
01:54:01,800 --> 01:54:03,383
It's over.

1688
01:54:06,341 --> 01:54:08,591
Rascals!

1689
01:54:10,425 --> 01:54:12,175
Bastards!

1690
01:54:34,758 --> 01:54:36,091
Rascals!

1691
01:54:36,216 --> 01:54:39,591
Where do you think you're going? You
torched our house, you scumbag!

1692
01:54:40,050 --> 01:54:41,091
Stop!

1693
01:54:41,216 --> 01:54:43,008
Where do you think you're going?

1694
01:54:43,133 --> 01:54:44,758
Rascals!

1695
01:54:54,800 --> 01:54:57,175
Uncle Salim!

1696
01:55:13,383 --> 01:55:14,550
Uncle Salim!

1697
01:55:38,425 --> 01:55:41,258
We evicted them for you.

1698
01:55:41,925 --> 01:55:43,258
You can go now.

1699
01:55:43,633 --> 01:55:47,175
Because you won't be able to
tolerate what happens next.

1700
01:55:47,300 --> 01:55:53,841
You see, my boys are going to
reinstate this brothel for a while.

1701
01:55:54,466 --> 01:55:57,883
There must be some advantage
of evicting a brothel.

1702
01:56:59,425 --> 01:57:00,550
What happened?

1703
01:57:03,300 --> 01:57:04,508
Hey!

1704
01:57:05,591 --> 01:57:07,175
Sluts, what are you doing?

1705
01:57:07,300 --> 01:57:09,216
You will all die.
- What's happening, Kabir?

1706
01:57:20,966 --> 01:57:24,258
Your clients won't save you.

1707
01:57:24,966 --> 01:57:26,175
Come back.

1708
01:58:08,341 --> 01:58:09,758
Wait!

1709
01:58:23,508 --> 01:58:24,550
Auntie!

1710
01:58:26,591 --> 01:58:29,841
Tell me the story of Padmavati.

1711
01:58:33,508 --> 01:58:38,133
It was a moonless night when the
world plunged into darkness.

1712
01:58:39,091 --> 01:58:41,758
The sun and moon
disappeared from sight.

1713
01:58:42,841 --> 01:58:48,966
When 12,000 Rajput women gathered
in the temple of Chittaur.

1714
01:58:49,925 --> 01:58:54,675
Queen Padmavati
entered the temple

1715
01:58:55,925 --> 01:58:58,258
and evoked the God of fire.

1716
01:58:59,508 --> 01:59:01,258
"Oh Fire God,"

1717
01:59:01,633 --> 01:59:05,258
"come and perish our
body, our soul"

1718
01:59:05,508 --> 01:59:08,300
"and this darkness."

1719
01:59:11,591 --> 01:59:15,841
Queen Padmavati, who was
standing in front of the fire

1720
01:59:16,341 --> 01:59:18,091
had only two options.

1721
01:59:18,675 --> 01:59:21,966
First, surrendering
to the enemy.

1722
01:59:22,091 --> 01:59:26,175
Bowing before them and
leading a life of slavery.

1723
01:59:26,758 --> 01:59:30,716
Or sacrificing her life.

1724
01:59:30,841 --> 01:59:35,216
A glorious death, like the way
she had been living so far.

1725
01:59:35,675 --> 01:59:38,216
With her head held high,
on her own terms.

1726
01:59:38,341 --> 01:59:40,175
Like a queen.

1727
01:59:40,675 --> 01:59:41,675
And...

1728
01:59:41,800 --> 01:59:45,258
Queen Padmavati chose the option

1729
01:59:45,383 --> 01:59:48,300
that suits a queen.

1730
01:59:48,758 --> 01:59:52,383
Standing on the verge of death

1731
01:59:52,675 --> 01:59:57,758
Queen Padmavati jumped into that fire
and let her self-esteem prevail.

1732
01:59:58,300 --> 01:59:59,633
She made it immortal.

1733
02:00:00,466 --> 02:00:01,466
She made it immortal.

1734
02:00:01,591 --> 02:00:14,008
"When the darkness
will slowly recede."

1735
02:00:19,216 --> 02:00:25,008
"When the clouds of
sorrow fade away"

1736
02:00:25,133 --> 02:00:31,466
"and we'll be graced
by a sea of joy."

1737
02:00:33,966 --> 02:00:39,466
"When the sky will sway"

1738
02:00:39,925 --> 02:00:46,008
"and the earth will sing songs."

1739
02:00:46,133 --> 02:00:51,341
"That dawn will come from us."

1740
02:00:51,716 --> 02:00:57,008
"That dawn will come from us."

1741
02:00:57,633 --> 02:01:03,091
"That dawn will come from us."

1742
02:01:03,508 --> 02:01:09,050
"That dawn will come from us."

1743
02:01:12,175 --> 02:01:15,716
"The dawn for which"

1744
02:01:15,841 --> 02:01:24,550
"we've been yearning
for centuries."

1745
02:01:29,925 --> 02:01:35,466
"The glorious dawn for which"

1746
02:01:35,883 --> 02:01:42,050
"we endure all the sorrows."

1747
02:01:47,800 --> 02:01:53,550
"These craving, yearning souls"

1748
02:01:53,675 --> 02:01:59,258
"will someday be blessed."

1749
02:01:59,550 --> 02:02:05,050
"That dawn will come from us."

1750
02:02:05,508 --> 02:02:11,466
"That dawn will come from us."

1751
02:02:42,341 --> 02:02:47,925
"I admit that the
price of our desires"

1752
02:02:48,300 --> 02:02:54,508
"are not too high."
