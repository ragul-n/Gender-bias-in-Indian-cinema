Kollur Mookambika

3
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,438
Go straight.

4
00:04:36,433 --> 00:04:42,543
Just 400..
450.. 500!!

5
00:05:26,567 --> 00:05:35,214
" My dear..
My mother, as beautiful as a flower"

6
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,135
Mom!

7
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,272
Mom!

00:06:01,567 --> 00:06:02,602

Mom!

12
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:45,370
Mom!

13
00:06:47,267 --> 00:06:48,439
Mom!

14
00:06:48,567 --> 00:06:50,979
I want to go to my mom!

15
00:06:51,567 --> 00:06:54,047
I want to see my mom!

16
00:06:57,267 --> 00:06:58,746
Mom!

17
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,179

18
00:07:20,433 --> 00:07:22,777
Mom!

19
00:07:24,367 --> 00:07:29,373
I want to see my mom!

20
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,535
Mad havetta,

21
00:07:51,267 --> 00:07:52,268
What's his name?

22
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,435
Aravindan.

23
00:08:02,667 --> 00:08:09,983
"You are my mother"

24
00:08:10,367 --> 00:08:14,213
" O Goddess Mookambika"

25
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:21,142
" Hold me tight"

26
00:08:24,733 --> 00:08:28,237
2015 July 18
Eid-Ul-Fitr

27
00:08:49,367 --> 00:08:52,246
Dude, there are 2 roads.
It's confusing.

28
00:08:52,367 --> 00:08:54,438
Someone get down and
check that board.

29
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,409
Oh no! It's in Kannada!

30
00:08:57,633 --> 00:09:00,546
Can't they write it in English?
Can't understand anything!

31
00:09:00,667 --> 00:09:04,376
I have the number of someone I know in
Mookambika. Let me try calling him.

32
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,138
Dude, this is a tiger zone.

33
00:09:06,267 --> 00:09:07,974
Don't ask for trouble.
Come!

34
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,238
It will eat up
everything we have!

35
00:09:09,367 --> 00:09:10,675
Is it Mookambika guest house?

36
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:55,673
'Aravindante Athithikal'
(Aravindan's Guests)

37
00:10:16,233 --> 00:10:17,439
Red Salute!

38
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,678
(Singing a Kannada song)

39
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,441
O Mother Goddess Mookambika!

40
00:10:30,567 --> 00:10:33,309
O Mystical Goddess,
The All Powerful!

41
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,977
O Mother of the world,
The Goddess of the world!

42
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:40,240
The names for the Devi (Goddess) is
increasing day by day, huh?

43
00:10:40,367 --> 00:10:41,778
Even my age is
increasing, right?

44
00:10:42,067 --> 00:10:44,445
I feel that the age is
decreasing though.

45
00:10:44,567 --> 00:10:46,046
Devi's blessings!

46
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,306
(Singing a devotional song)

47
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,502
It's not wrong to read the
newspaper once in a while.

48
00:10:54,633 --> 00:10:55,611
No need!

49
00:10:55,733 --> 00:10:58,714
If I read once, I'll have to read daily.
Then it will be a habit.

50
00:11:01,033 --> 00:11:02,376
This has been going on for long!

51
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,079
Someone go and check.

52
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,146
If he rings the bell
again, I'll hit him!

53
00:11:06,267 --> 00:11:08,247
You'll only hit him, right?
I will kill him!

54
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:09,402
Loser!

55
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,143
You devil!
You know me, right?

56
00:11:20,467 --> 00:11:22,037
You know me, right?

57
00:11:22,167 --> 00:11:23,544
What's there to know?

58
00:11:23,667 --> 00:11:26,273
I know!
Loser! A bloody loser!

59
00:11:26,433 --> 00:11:27,343
Good for nothing!

60
00:11:27,467 --> 00:11:29,640
I'll throw this on you...
- Get lost, you good for nothing!

61
00:11:29,767 --> 00:11:31,303
You won't do shit!

62
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,571
I am Vettikkavala Suni's sister!

63
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,077
You know, right?
- I know!

64
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,975
I know! Vettikkavala Bindu!

65
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,670
Shady Bind u!

66
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,177
Oh my God!

67
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,779
I lost my breath!
- Let it go!

68
00:11:42,067 --> 00:11:43,011
Oh God!

69
00:11:43,133 --> 00:11:44,339
Come fast!

70
00:11:44,467 --> 00:11:46,208
What happened, Chetta?
- She broke my ribs!

71
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:47,311
What is it, Chechi?

72
00:11:47,433 --> 00:11:49,470
Hey! Isn't this a temple?

73
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:55,145
Temple, it seems! It's a lodge!
You don't even know that, stupid!

74
00:11:55,267 --> 00:11:57,543
It's the temple premises..
- Compound!

75
00:11:57,667 --> 00:11:58,702
That's rig ht!

76
00:11:59,033 --> 00:12:00,740
What have we come here for?

77
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,102
To pray for a child, right?

78
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,643
So shouldn't he pray to the
Devi decently or not?

79
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:07,973
You tell me!

80
00:12:08,133 --> 00:12:09,111
Yes.

81
00:12:09,233 --> 00:12:12,271
But even here, he's fondling on
WhatsApp, this good for nothing loser!

82
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:16,704
It's a group of my
friends from Parasshala.

83
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,205
It's a friends' group, Chechi..
- Friends, it seems..

84
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:21,313
Do you know what the
name of that group is?

85
00:12:21,433 --> 00:12:22,639
Is it named after your daddy?

86
00:12:22,767 --> 00:12:24,713
You bloody..
'Blue Sparrow'

87
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,135
Blue...

88
00:12:35,167 --> 00:12:37,147
- We should have had
breakfast from here.

89
00:12:37,267 --> 00:12:38,644
Oh! You're leaving?

90
00:12:38,767 --> 00:12:40,110
Dude, awesome place, right?

91
00:12:40,633 --> 00:12:43,113
Kudajadri is the best
trekking spot in the south.

92
00:12:43,233 --> 00:12:45,144
The extreme for off-roading.
Go ahead!

93
00:12:45,267 --> 00:12:46,177
Is the Jeep ready?

94
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,608
Well.. Just a minute!

95
00:12:52,233 --> 00:12:53,234
The ogler is busy at work!

96
00:12:53,367 --> 00:12:54,277
Hey!

97
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,311
Aren't you ready yet?

You'll be late for school.
Go fast!

104
00:13:07,267 --> 00:13:08,302
How is he?

105
00:13:08,733 --> 00:13:11,043
Good guy. Half of what he asks for.
That's his rate.

106
00:13:11,167 --> 00:13:12,475
I'll give that.
- You guys have fun!

107
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,738
Come. Let's go!

108
00:13:14,033 --> 00:13:15,239
You'll be late!

109
00:13:16,033 --> 00:13:17,034
Give me the flowers..

110
00:13:17,167 --> 00:13:18,237
I'll give you!
Don't shout!

111
00:13:18,367 --> 00:13:21,075
(speaking in Kannada)
- Hey!

112
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:23,444
You came in the morning itself?

113
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,376
Since that aunty asked us to,
we bought all the flowers!

114
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,140
I have enough and more money;
so thought I'll spend it!

115
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:30,371
Hey! Red Swamy!

116
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,504
For the 'Enemy-Destruction' Pooja, should
we write down the name <i>&</i> horoscope,

117
00:13:33,633 --> 00:13:35,772
or should I just wish in my mind
that he should be damned?

118
00:13:36,067 --> 00:13:37,603
There's no 'Enemy-Destruction'
Pooja here.

119
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:39,474
Then what kind of a temple is this?

120
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,006
Let's go in.
Come on.

121
00:13:41,533 --> 00:13:42,477
You also come.

122
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,375
<i>You cam; an, Chem.
- Come, give us company.</i>

123
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,002
I'm telling you, rig ht?
- No, son.

124
00:13:46,133 --> 00:13:48,670
Why? - He won't come.
- He doesn't like praying to the Goddess?

125
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,074
Don't force him.

126
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,180
He won't come, son.
- You carry on, Chetta.

127
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,210
Then you come!

128
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,971
Oh Lord!

129
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,579
Shucks! Oh Goddess!

130
00:14:06,367 --> 00:14:08,745
" My dear"

131
00:14:09,033 --> 00:14:10,603
Aravindan!

132
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:15,570
" My mother, as beautiful as a flower"

133
00:14:21,767 --> 00:14:24,748
I told you to bring flowers.
Didn't you bring them?

134
00:14:25,033 --> 00:14:26,671
He's the one who promised
the flowers, not me.

135
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,710
What is it, aunty?

136
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,980
He said he didn't
get the flowers.

137
00:14:30,133 --> 00:14:31,339
Don't make a fuss now, aunty.

138
00:14:31,633 --> 00:14:32,668
I got them!

139
00:14:33,133 --> 00:14:35,010
Grandma, are you happy now?
- Yes.

140
00:14:35,133 --> 00:14:36,168
Namaste sir.

141
00:14:57,367 --> 00:15:03,784
" Srilakshmi, the merciful...
Yellamma, the auspiciousness herself"

142
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:10,483
" Srilakshmi, the merciful...
Yellamma, the auspiciousness herself"

143
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:17,074
"The Shivashankari who resides in all
four directions where the words bloom"

144
00:15:17,433 --> 00:15:23,679
" The Devi who teaches us
all the Vedas and chants"

145
00:15:24,233 --> 00:15:30,775
" I have come in search of you,
trembling with the pain in my heart"

146
00:15:31,067 --> 00:15:35,516
"When I'm before you with folded hands,
won't you kiss me on my forehead,

147
00:15:35,633 --> 00:15:37,203
and hold me closer?"

148
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:43,511
"0 Devi, the merciful"

149
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:49,506
"0 Devi, the merciful"

150
00:15:49,633 --> 00:15:51,135
O Mother Goddess!

151
00:15:51,267 --> 00:15:56,307
" O Merciful Mookambika Devi"

152
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:02,515
"0 Devi, the merciful"

153
00:16:02,667 --> 00:16:04,408
Hey darling!
One selfie!

154
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,544
" O Merciful Mookambika Devi"

155
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:09,203
'Mother, please!'

156
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:11,108
Bloody beggar!

157
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,335
Look at him!

158
00:16:12,733 --> 00:16:14,679
He looks like Kottayam
Naseer, right?

159
00:16:15,533 --> 00:16:17,206
Boss!
Boss!

160
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:18,437
Boss!
- What?

161
00:16:18,567 --> 00:16:20,774
Why have you worn the 'Tilak' like that?
Latest fashion?

162
00:16:21,433 --> 00:16:22,969
Get lost!

163
00:16:31,433 --> 00:16:38,214
" Srilakshmi, the merciful...
Yellamma, the auspiciousness herself"

164
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:43,373
" Srilakshmi, the merciful...
Yellamma, the auspiciousness herself"

165
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,570
<i>ODE“!</i>

166
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:47,146
Look at the blue sheets.
Come on!

167
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,710
Give me..

168
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,978
Give me 500 more.
- Enough?

169
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:54,976
Give me!

170
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,977
Give me..
- You brought the foreigners, fine!

171
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,239
- So the Kudajadri trip?
- We'll have a blast!

172
00:17:00,267 --> 00:17:01,746
- You idiot!
- Oh my God!

173
00:17:02,033 --> 00:17:03,068
Please! Don't hit me!

174
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,406
I'm not the owner.
It's him!

175
00:17:04,533 --> 00:17:06,206
I'm not the owner either.
- Where's my money?

176
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:07,471
This is your rest-room?

177
00:17:07,667 --> 00:17:08,611
This is shit-hole!

178
00:17:08,733 --> 00:17:10,679
We'll change the room.
- Give me my money back!

179
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,108
I won't give it..
- Give the money..

180
00:17:12,233 --> 00:17:13,473
Just give the money!
- Give it back!

181
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,977
He's really powerful.

182
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,137
M
mam

183
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,511
But sir..
- Bye!

184
00:17:18,633 --> 00:17:20,738
Haven't we told you
to keep it clean?

185
00:17:21,767 --> 00:17:24,247
Kudajadri!
Kudajadri!

186
00:17:24,367 --> 00:17:26,438
Kudajadri..
Yes. Come on!

187
00:17:26,567 --> 00:17:27,637
Come. Get in!

188
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:35,149
"Kudajadri, where the mist embraced after
wandering endlessly, to continue chanting"

189
00:17:35,267 --> 00:17:41,707
"The sun has come after a bath,
to light the lamp of the dawn"

190
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,542
" On the shores of the Holy Souparnika
river, there's a golden cloud chariot"

191
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:55,016
" Even in the breeze of this wilderness,
the mantra of Shankaracharya resonates"

192
00:17:55,133 --> 00:17:57,306
I'll go to Murudeshwara <i>&</i>
then to the hotel. - Okay.

193
00:17:57,433 --> 00:17:59,140
Shall I click a photo?
- Yes. Please.

194
00:18:00,133 --> 00:18:01,134
Okay, Madhavan.

195
00:18:01,267 --> 00:18:02,575
See you.
- Bye, sir.

196
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,701
Who was it?

197
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,240
MT Vasudevan Nair..

198
00:18:05,367 --> 00:18:07,711
The one who wrote Pulimurugan?
- That's his elder brother.

199
00:18:08,667 --> 00:18:14,743
"The Shivashankari who resides in all
four directions where the words bloom"

200
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:22,381
" The Devi who teaches us
all the Vedas and chants"

201
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:28,746
" I have come in search of you,
trembling with the pain in my heart"

202
00:18:30,367 --> 00:18:31,971
Look at the poster!

203
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,010
How is it?

204
00:18:33,133 --> 00:18:34,441
You've kept the board upside down.
Keep it straight.

205
00:18:34,567 --> 00:18:35,568
Oh no! My CD!

206
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:42,117
"0 Devi, the merciful"

207
00:18:42,533 --> 00:18:49,109
"0 Devi, the merciful"

208
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:55,012
" O Merciful Mookambika Devi"

209
00:18:56,267 --> 00:19:02,548
" Srilakshmi, the merciful...
Yellamma, the auspiciousness herself"

210
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:09,542
" Srilakshmi, the merciful...
Yellamma, the auspiciousness herself"

211
00:19:11,433 --> 00:19:14,032
(Chanting prayers)

212
00:19:14,033 --> 00:19:15,273
(Chanting prayers)

213
00:19:15,467 --> 00:19:16,969
What the hell is he saying?

214
00:19:17,733 --> 00:19:21,010
Keep quiet. It's a prayer for
you to be blessed with a child.

215
00:19:21,133 --> 00:19:23,238
I thought he was
cussing at her dad.

216
00:19:23,367 --> 00:19:25,142
Pray, Chetta!

217
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,179
Son or daughter?

218
00:19:31,433 --> 00:19:33,037
Sir, son or daughter?
Whom do you want?

219
00:19:33,167 --> 00:19:34,339
Son!
- Daughter!

220
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,608
Son!
- Daughter!

221
00:19:36,733 --> 00:19:38,679
Son!
- Daughter, Swamy!

222
00:19:40,167 --> 00:19:43,171
She'll end up eloping with someone.
I won't pay any dowry!

223
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,506
Will your daddy pay?

224
00:19:44,633 --> 00:19:46,670
Chetta, decide on something.. - Son!
- Daughter!

225
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,778
Okay. Daughter!

226
00:19:48,067 --> 00:19:53,483
(Praying for a daughter)

227
00:19:55,433 --> 00:19:57,379
Tying a cradle alone
is not enough, Chetta.

228
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,409
God proposes,
Man disposes, right?

229
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:01,671
Don't laugh!
Chechi is here.

230
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:06,476
First night is when any loser
would get a glass of milk!

231
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,513
She is someone who didn't even
give me that. Do you know?

232
00:20:09,633 --> 00:20:11,010
And what you said..
- Chetta!

233
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,207
God proposes,
Man disposes!

234
00:20:13,533 --> 00:20:14,978
Chechi, give him the milk.

235
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,202
I'm closing the door <i>&</i> leaving.
Okay! Good night!

236
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:18,368
Good night!

237
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,736
See you next time!

238
00:20:37,033 --> 00:20:42,312
(Singing a popular Malayalam film song)

239
00:20:42,433 --> 00:20:49,373
(Singing together)

240
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,707
How come you're alone, Raghavetta?
There's nobody here?

241
00:20:52,033 --> 00:20:53,478
No, man!
No one has any devotion!

242
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,136
It's all right.
Let the season start.

243
00:20:55,267 --> 00:20:56,575
Everything will be all right.
- Let's see.

244
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,077
Everything will be all right.

245
00:20:59,067 --> 00:21:05,450
(Singing another popular
Malayalam film song 'Chandanamani')

246
00:21:09,133 --> 00:21:11,636
(singing together)

247
00:21:11,767 --> 00:21:12,745
Chandamanani...

248
00:21:13,033 --> 00:21:14,535
Not Chandamanani..
Chandanamani..

249
00:21:15,533 --> 00:21:16,443
Have the 'Vada'.

250
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:17,511
Something to bite into!

251
00:21:17,633 --> 00:21:19,078
That's not new, rig ht?

252
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,477
You always do it, right?

253
00:21:22,033 --> 00:21:23,068
Rag havetta, one tea.

254
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,611
Didn't you get to
kill anyone today?

255
00:21:24,733 --> 00:21:27,145
No scoundrel wants to knowthe future.
What should I do?

256
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,635
You're laughing?

257
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:40,271
2016 March 23
'Utram' day of 'Meenam' Month.

258
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,538
Great place to stay, 24 hours
security, hot water, homely food!

259
00:21:46,667 --> 00:21:49,614
A home away from home!
Only 1500 metres from Mookambika stand!

260
00:21:49,733 --> 00:21:51,644
Thankaraj, go to the back-door.

261
00:21:51,767 --> 00:21:53,371
Sir, rooms!

262
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,002
Cheap rooms available, sir.

263
00:21:55,133 --> 00:21:57,477
Well.. the back door.. I... -You take
the back door. I'll take the guests.

264
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,705
Rooms available..
Rooms with cradles available, madam.

265
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,105
Hot water, homely food,
a home away from home!

266
00:22:02,233 --> 00:22:04,440
Only 1500 metres from Mookambika stand.
- Hey brother!

267
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,677
Brother, sing that song again!

268
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,677
Which song, sir?
- That 'Room Available' song.

269
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,475
24 hours security"
- Not necessary.

270
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,604
Homely food..
- I like hotel food!

271
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:19,006
Heritage!
- No need of heritage, man!

272
00:22:19,133 --> 00:22:21,340
Then what else do you want, sir?
- Discount!

273
00:22:21,467 --> 00:22:23,208
We'll do it, sir..
No problem at all!

274
00:22:26,567 --> 00:22:28,569
Sorry, brother.
He's very short-tempered.

275
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,146
If someone touches his
face, he will hit them.

276
00:22:31,733 --> 00:22:32,609
It's all right, sir.

277
00:22:32,733 --> 00:22:34,770
2 rooms would be enough for
a small family, right?

278
00:22:35,067 --> 00:22:36,512
It will be enough, sir.
- Confirmed?

279
00:22:36,633 --> 00:22:37,634
Confirmed, sir.

280
00:22:37,767 --> 00:22:40,247
Hey children! Come on!
We got the room!

281
00:22:40,367 --> 00:22:42,404
Grandma! Uncle!
Come on!

282
00:22:42,533 --> 00:22:45,104
Come on! We got rooms.
- Oh Goddess! Not 2 rooms;

283
00:22:45,267 --> 00:22:46,644
they would need at
least 2 lodges.

284
00:22:46,767 --> 00:22:49,145
Am
H my

285
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:50,575
Are you here on a
school tour, sir?

286
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,579
Hold him. Whatever we do, we
should do it big, brother!

287
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:56,306
All these are my
own productions!

288
00:22:56,433 --> 00:22:57,605
Come on!

289
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,678
Kudajadri!

290
00:23:01,633 --> 00:23:03,635
Chechi, Kudajadri..
I'll take you without shaking.

291
00:23:03,767 --> 00:23:06,145
Kud ajad ri..
- We already went there.

292
00:23:06,267 --> 00:23:07,644
Its
a

293
00:23:07,767 --> 00:23:09,542
Go and fool them!

294
00:23:09,667 --> 00:23:11,977
I'm taking an orange.

295
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,602
Shouldn't you arrange it properly?

296
00:23:13,733 --> 00:23:15,144
Keep them back correctly.

297
00:23:15,267 --> 00:23:16,769
(shouting in Kannada)

298
00:23:17,067 --> 00:23:20,207
There are enough people for a procession.
Did they ban 'Jallikkattu' again?

299
00:23:20,533 --> 00:23:23,343
Hold this.
Keep it back yourself.

300
00:23:23,467 --> 00:23:25,105
I've heard about Souparnika.

301
00:23:25,233 --> 00:23:27,474
That bald kid is his weakness!

302
00:23:31,467 --> 00:23:32,502
What is this?

303
00:23:33,033 --> 00:23:34,205
What's that?
A little devil?

304
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:35,505
I thought of telling you.

305
00:23:35,633 --> 00:23:37,078
Then I thought I
needn't say it.

306
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,577
Sir, please come.
- Coming, brother.

307
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,306
This moustache-less fellow didn't
feel bad for getting slapped, right?

308
00:23:41,433 --> 00:23:43,140
No. He's used to getting
beaten up, sir.

309
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,738
That's Malayalam
actor Babu Antony.

310
00:23:47,033 --> 00:23:48,410
Oh God! Babu Antony?

311
00:23:48,533 --> 00:23:49,443
Who is that?

312
00:23:49,567 --> 00:23:51,046
Your father in law?

313
00:23:52,433 --> 00:23:57,178
Hey! It's not a crime to not know
AKG in Tamil Nadu. Calm down!

314
00:23:59,267 --> 00:24:01,372
Name, address, advance..

315
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,741
No writing!
Only speaking!

316
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:06,677
Reception uncle, writing is your job!
Write!

317
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,677
- Make way!
- Name?

318
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,177
Swarnalingam!

319
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,680
Oh God!
So that's the secret?

320
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,172
That's quite a powerful name!

321
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,337
Come on in!
- Write!

322
00:24:19,167 --> 00:24:21,044
Reception uncle, you're
going on writing?

323
00:24:21,167 --> 00:24:23,374
I asked for only two
rooms in total, brother.

324
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,240
Did you say that 2 rooms would
be enough for all of them?

325
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,141
There's the population
of an entire district.

326
00:24:29,267 --> 00:24:30,575
They are naive people, Madhavetta.

327
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:33,374
He called me uncle as soon as he
came, and you're saying he's naive?

328
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,570
I gave him my word.

329
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,112
Didn't you teach me that
we have to keep our word?

330
00:24:37,233 --> 00:24:40,305
You learned everything that I
taught you, to the dot? Good!

331
00:24:40,767 --> 00:24:41,643
Brother!

332
00:24:41,767 --> 00:24:43,041
The room is downstairs, right?

333
00:24:43,167 --> 00:24:45,306
All are old people. Didn't you see?
- We'll get it done. You come, sir.

334
00:24:45,433 --> 00:24:48,107
Aravindan, didn't they
book the room downstairs?

335
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,980
Brother, the room is downstairs, right?

336
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,738
Yes.
- Then come. Let's go.

337
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,971
But on top, there's an MGR...

338
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,545
MGR stayed here?
- No.

339
00:24:57,667 --> 00:24:59,647
Not MGR..
His mentor used to stay here.

340
00:24:59,767 --> 00:25:02,304
So for his remembrance, we've
put a huge photo there.

341
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:04,038
Sir, I want that room!

342
00:25:04,167 --> 00:25:07,637
A
a

343
00:25:07,767 --> 00:25:09,075
It's all right?
- Ya.

344
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,270
Okay?
Then you proceed.

345
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,141
I'll come.
- Come fast.

346
00:25:12,667 --> 00:25:14,169
How was that?

347
00:25:14,367 --> 00:25:17,075
I didn't teach this. -I learned
this on my own for our survival.

348
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:19,310
Mr. Sumesh, shift
MGR from 8 to 14,

349
00:25:19,433 --> 00:25:21,037
and NTR from 14 to 8.
Make it fast.

350
00:25:21,167 --> 00:25:24,705
Well Aravindan, for Tamilians, there's MGR;
forAndhra people, there's NTR;

351
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,274
for Karnataka people,
there's Rajkumar.

352
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,471
So who is it for us Malayalis?
- Thomas Chandy.

353
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,705
Oh! That's correct.
- Correct, right?

354
00:25:33,533 --> 00:25:34,568
Bathe properly.

355
00:25:35,067 --> 00:25:37,047
Uncle, use the soap and bathe!

356
00:25:37,167 --> 00:25:39,511
Dad, if I apply the soap <i>&</i> bathe
like this, will I become fair?

357
00:25:39,633 --> 00:25:40,703
Why do you want to be fair?

358
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,071
Black is the original Indian colour!

359
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,975
Even our Super Star is dark skinned!

360
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,080
Bathe properly!
Apply n well!

361
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,103
Look, it's God!
Oh God!

362
00:25:57,233 --> 00:25:59,679
Bless us!
Oh God!

363
00:26:00,333 --> 00:26:01,368
Com e.

364
00:26:02,633 --> 00:26:04,078
Doing good?
- Yes.

365
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,578
This is the address and phone
number of the Devasthana.

366
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,070
And here's the advance.
- Okay.

367
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,680
Okay? Happy?
- Very happy!

368
00:26:12,267 --> 00:26:13,211
Hey!

369
00:26:13,333 --> 00:26:15,279
I brought 3 of them.
What about its commission?

370
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,676
It's off-season, right?
Let those poor things make a living.

371
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,144
Do you want to snatch from that too?
- A little.

372
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,506
Brothers!
- What?

373
00:26:22,167 --> 00:26:23,771
I was saying that the
bathing here was superb.

374
00:26:24,067 --> 00:26:25,068
That's because it's
your first time!

375
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,407
Not just bathing, even the
food at the temple is amazing.

376
00:26:27,533 --> 00:26:28,637
Is that so?
Will it be so good?

377
00:26:28,767 --> 00:26:29,745
Yes. That too, for free.

378
00:26:30,033 --> 00:26:32,240
Free? Where do I get
it inside the temple?

379
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,346
Once you enter the temple,
when you come around,

380
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:37,175
there's an offering counter on the left
side, right? -Yes. - Behind that.

381
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,541
Then you also join us!
- I eat Chappathi at night.

382
00:26:39,667 --> 00:26:41,578
No sir. You've come with your family.

383
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,236
You carry on.
- Very happy!

384
00:26:43,367 --> 00:26:44,311
Okay.

385
00:26:44,433 --> 00:26:45,776
You don't have this
affection towards me!

386
00:26:46,067 --> 00:26:47,740
He's a poor chap.
You're a fraud!

387
00:26:48,034 --> 00:26:49,741
Fraud?
- Yes. Fraud!

388
00:26:54,534 --> 00:26:56,605
Wipe your head properly!

389
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,535
What's going on?

390
00:27:00,667 --> 00:27:02,374
Are you watching porn,
Mr. Madhavan sir?

391
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,241
Your dad's the one
who watches porn!

392
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:07,702
Hey!

393
00:27:09,633 --> 00:27:13,979
"24 hour hot water, 24 hour security,
room service"

394
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,410
You should stop chasing
people saying all that.

395
00:27:16,534 --> 00:27:17,512
And then?

396
00:27:17,633 --> 00:27:18,668
Let's..

397
00:27:19,233 --> 00:27:20,576
Let's start online booking.

398
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,170
That's nice..
- First...

399
00:27:23,633 --> 00:27:25,772
we should paint it well and
make it look very good.

400
00:27:26,067 --> 00:27:27,444
We should change all
the old furniture!

401
00:27:27,567 --> 00:27:30,013
AC and TV in all rooms...

402
00:27:30,133 --> 00:27:32,670
Water heater, shower, bath tub...

403
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:36,145
We should get a good cook,
and make lots of food..

404
00:27:36,267 --> 00:27:39,043
North Indian, Chinese and so on..

405
00:27:39,433 --> 00:27:42,209
We should charge extra rent
and have a great time!

406
00:27:42,334 --> 00:27:43,369
<i>Wow'!</i>

407
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,140
Such a beautiful dream that's
never going to happen!

408
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,343
Try to paint it before
the next season!

409
00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:50,378
Reception uncle, doing good?

410
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,681
Brother, the free food was amazing!

411
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,780
Tell him that they can sleep
there for free as well.

412
00:27:56,067 --> 00:27:59,071
Is this Reception Uncle a fool?
He's always getting angry!

413
00:27:59,367 --> 00:28:01,108
I'll take care of this fool.

414
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:04,042
You go to sleep, sir.
- Let it happen as per your fate!

You know how many of them are there?
- Most are kids, right?

A little sambar, a few ldlys, a
little Chutney! That's enough!

Pour it, man!

423
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:31,040

I think this will go on till night.

I have only Sam bar
with me, old man!

Ask for whatever you need.

433

We shouldn't cheat our tummies!

Grandma, the Sam bar was
absolutely amazing!

435
00:28:59,433 --> 00:29:02,209
It's not grandma, but Aravindan
who prepared the Sam bar.

It was really good!

Rasheed, what do we do now?

There are many more
people left to eat.

There are some firecrackers in the Jeep.
Shall I light <i>&</i> throw it on them?

We're not at all interested
to stay for lower rent.

00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,776
Is he with you, sir?
I'll talk to him!

519
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:17,478
Go, boy!
Go! Go!

520
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,635
Mom, come.
Let's go!

521
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,102
Coming, girl.
Let me tell you something. Come!

522
00:32:21,233 --> 00:32:23,110
Come!
- Or no need. I'll come there.

523
00:32:23,233 --> 00:32:25,372
Shall we stay in that boy's lodge?

524
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,480
No. Dad has booked a room, right?
That's enough.

525
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,136
He's giving it on a lower rent.

526
00:32:29,267 --> 00:32:30,177
Son, come here.

527
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:32,541
Tell her whatever you
told me about your lodge.

528
00:32:32,667 --> 00:32:35,978
A great place to stay, 24 hours security,
hot water, homely food;

529
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,170
a heritage of 150 years,

530
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,780
only 1500 metres from Mookambika stand,
you can't find it anywhere else.

531
00:32:40,067 --> 00:32:42,707
So many facilities! Isn't that enough?
- No. Let's stay where dad booked.

532
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,140
It's a much lower rent.
Look at his face. Such a graceful fellow.

533
00:32:46,267 --> 00:32:47,268
He looks innocent.

534
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,607
Shall I call my brother in law?

535
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:51,077
Call!
- I'll call right away.

536
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,771
I'll also call your wife.
I have to tell her certain things.

537
00:32:54,067 --> 00:32:57,776
I'll tell her what all you did since
you got into this bus yesterday.

538
00:32:58,067 --> 00:32:59,102
Him <i>&</i> his brother in law!
Come here.

539
00:32:59,234 --> 00:33:00,679
Chechi!
- Son, hold this suitcase.

540
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,245
- Let him stay there!
- Listen to me!

541
00:33:02,367 --> 00:33:03,471
Idiot!
You get lost!

542
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,511
Come here.
- I'll take the suitcase.

543
00:33:05,634 --> 00:33:06,510
Okay! Okay!

544
00:33:06,633 --> 00:33:08,579
I'll talk to brother-in-law
and compromise things.

545
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:12,011
But you need to treat me well!
- Of course!

546
00:33:12,134 --> 00:33:13,477
Take a deep breath!

547
00:33:15,434 --> 00:33:17,573
What do you feel?
- Local stuff?

548
00:33:18,234 --> 00:33:19,338
You said it!

549
00:33:20,134 --> 00:33:21,044
Is it so?
- Smart boy!

550
00:33:21,167 --> 00:33:22,578
Thank you.
- I am proud of you!

551
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,771
M
a

552
00:33:25,067 --> 00:33:26,068
Daily?
- Daily!

553
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,543
Always?
- AIWay§!

554
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,404
This place also has all this?

555
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:35,042
What's written there? What language is it?
- Kannada, madam.

556
00:33:35,433 --> 00:33:36,468
Hey Chacha Nehru!

557
00:33:36,733 --> 00:33:38,474
Is it Gandhiji's birth
anniversary today?

558
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,079
It's Children's day, sir.

559
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,043
Then bottles must
be available today!

560
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,673
Will there be any problem if
Prabhakaran sir knows that?

561
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:49,213
My sister is a 'Bharthrumathifi
- What does that mean?

562
00:33:49,333 --> 00:33:51,335
That means, she's fed up of her husband!

563
00:33:51,467 --> 00:33:53,003
There are many in
Kerala like that now.

564
00:33:53,133 --> 00:33:54,339
Well, she is one among them.

565
00:33:54,467 --> 00:33:58,005
I'll tell you something. It's my husband
who pays for all your expenses!

566
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,645
I thought you were
a decent chap..

567
00:33:59,767 --> 00:34:01,246
But what all do you
say about him?

568
00:34:01,367 --> 00:34:02,710
Mm
mam

569
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,741
don't talk unnecessary things.
- Nothing like that, Chechi.

570
00:34:05,034 --> 00:34:06,012
When will we reach?

571
00:34:06,134 --> 00:34:07,272
We're almost there.

572
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,671
Tell me the truth.
Where are you taking us?

573
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,144
There's something
unnatural about this..

574
00:34:12,267 --> 00:34:13,177
No way!

575
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,608
When will we reach?
- We've reached.

576
00:34:14,734 --> 00:34:16,407
What?
- Seems like she's really serious!

577
00:34:16,533 --> 00:34:18,570
That's just her throwing attitude.
Don't mind!

578
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,303
She came here for her debut performance
after her course in Kalamandalam.

579
00:34:21,433 --> 00:34:22,343
Is it?
- Yes.

580
00:34:22,467 --> 00:34:23,411
All the best!

581
00:34:23,533 --> 00:34:24,978
You can buy the stuff you need from here!

582
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,704
It's in here.
- Over here?

583
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,240
Come.
- Why do you care?

584
00:34:28,367 --> 00:34:29,277
Watch your head.

585
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,778
I sense a fraud set-up.

586
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,207
If I don't get the bottle by 7
PM, you'll see my true colours.

587
00:34:35,334 --> 00:34:37,143
Bottle?
What bottle?

588
00:34:37,267 --> 00:34:38,541
We'll sort it out, Chetta.
Come!

589
00:34:38,667 --> 00:34:39,702
Chechi, come.

590
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,480
The room is upstairs.
- Who's that? Is he your father?

591
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,738
No.
- No?

592
00:34:44,033 --> 00:34:45,034
No.

593
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,604
Your face looks the same.

594
00:34:46,734 --> 00:34:49,510
Well, we've been living together for so
many years, right? Must be because of that.

595
00:34:49,634 --> 00:34:50,635
But how can that be?

596
00:34:50,767 --> 00:34:52,644
Where is the water?
- Coming, sir!

597
00:34:54,067 --> 00:34:55,637
Running hot water!

598
00:34:56,767 --> 00:34:58,371
24 hours!

599
00:35:09,134 --> 00:35:11,011
'Oru Murai Vanthu Panhaya'?

600
00:35:21,167 --> 00:35:22,202
Get the water.

601
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,572
Why are you burning outside?
Go inside.

602
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,202
So much smoke!

603
00:35:25,434 --> 00:35:26,640
Couldn't you do it earlier?

604
00:35:26,767 --> 00:35:28,246
Why are you crying for that?

605
00:35:28,367 --> 00:35:30,108
I'm not crying.
My eyes are watering.

606
00:35:30,234 --> 00:35:32,145
Isn't that called crying?

607
00:35:39,767 --> 00:35:40,973
Good morning!

608
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,510
Mom! Here's your running hot water.

609
00:35:43,633 --> 00:35:44,611
Anytime!
24 hours!

610
00:35:44,734 --> 00:35:46,179
See if it's hot enough!
- Very good.

611
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,779
It's not to fry.
It's to bathe!

612
00:35:48,067 --> 00:35:51,207
Just mix a little cold water.
Don't fight with him.

613
00:35:51,334 --> 00:35:52,369
Correct!

614
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,138
Hows the stay, madam?

615
00:35:54,267 --> 00:35:56,008
Should I say the truth, son?
- No!

616
00:35:56,134 --> 00:35:57,169
Thank you.

617
00:36:03,367 --> 00:36:05,108
Will it become cold
with that wind, Chetta?

618
00:36:05,234 --> 00:36:06,304
The tap is faulty.

619
00:36:06,434 --> 00:36:08,641
I'll son it out now.
- Don't just say that. Repair it.

620
00:36:08,767 --> 00:36:10,144
I will.
Definitely!

621
00:36:10,267 --> 00:36:11,371
When?
- Very soon.

622
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,535
Keep quiet, dear.

623
00:36:12,667 --> 00:36:15,238
Repair it by the time we
got out and come back.

624
00:36:15,367 --> 00:36:16,641
The performance is at 9.30, right?

625
00:36:16,767 --> 00:36:18,246
So there's a lot of time left.

626
00:36:18,367 --> 00:36:20,472
The box that's used to press...

627
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,735
I'll say it in Kannada..

628
00:36:22,067 --> 00:36:24,069
(tries to say it in broken Kannada)

629
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,679
Here's the box.
Go ahead.

630
00:36:26,034 --> 00:36:27,445
What is this?
- Iron box.

631
00:36:27,567 --> 00:36:28,568
This?
- Yes.

632
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,202
I didn't ask for a rat-trap!

633
00:36:30,334 --> 00:36:32,041
This dirty cloth can
be pressed with this.

634
00:36:32,167 --> 00:36:33,737
With this?
With this, I can burn it!

635
00:36:34,034 --> 00:36:35,411
It's a shin that
costs 1000 Rupees.

636
00:36:35,534 --> 00:36:38,071
Then it's better that you get
it pressed from a shop outside.

637
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,009
Turn it!
Clockwise!

638
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:41,976
Oh my God!

639
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:45,081
I asked you to turn it
clockwise, not to break it.

640
00:36:45,267 --> 00:36:47,269
Him <i>&</i> his clockwise!
Which side?

641
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,435
Ya. Try that side.

642
00:36:51,734 --> 00:36:53,236
You can do it, man!

643
00:36:53,367 --> 00:36:55,005
I've done this so many times!

644
00:36:57,233 --> 00:36:58,143
Oh my God!

645
00:36:58,267 --> 00:37:00,508
(mm
ER;

646
00:37:02,267 --> 00:37:04,770
I've told you not to keep yapping
while I'm doing something.

647
00:37:05,067 --> 00:37:07,047
The pipe broke because of you!
- No!

648
00:37:07,167 --> 00:37:08,578
Em
a

649
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,008
It broke because of you!

650
00:37:10,133 --> 00:37:13,171
There's no proper plumbing or
wiring in this 150 year old lodge.

651
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,404
And you're blaming me?

652
00:37:14,534 --> 00:37:15,444
Wow! Shower!

653
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:17,069
Didn't you close the
main tap, you fool?

654
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,372
If I close it there,
would water come here?

655
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,535
Oh my God!

656
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:20,735
Go <i>&</i> close it.
- What?

657
00:37:21,033 --> 00:37:22,068
Go close it!

658
00:37:22,434 --> 00:37:23,640
Oh my God!

659
00:37:24,567 --> 00:37:26,171
Oh no!
Rain!

660
00:37:28,334 --> 00:37:29,574
Stop it, man!

661
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,611
Ip; not stopping!
- 0h my God!

662
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,705
Oh God!

663
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,502
The attire for her performance.

664
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,343
Go <i>&</i> buy this attire
from somewhere, man!

665
00:37:38,467 --> 00:37:40,310
Hey!
Thousand Rupees!

666
00:37:40,433 --> 00:37:41,537
Five Hundred!
- 1000!

667
00:37:41,667 --> 00:37:42,702
Okay!

668
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,380
Everything is wet and ruined.

669
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,741
Oh God! The 'Vada' is also wet.

670
00:37:48,667 --> 00:37:50,078
Move away!
- Get lost!

671
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,007
Rashid, buy 2 'Vada's
when you come.

672
00:37:53,133 --> 00:37:54,271
That's all? Need anything else?

673
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,004
Nothing else!
- Oh God!

674
00:37:56,467 --> 00:37:57,502
Sumesh!

675
00:37:58,167 --> 00:37:59,510
I'll son it out now!

676
00:38:03,567 --> 00:38:04,602
It's okay now.

677
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:06,540
Hey Aravindan!

678
00:38:06,667 --> 00:38:07,771
Who's that?
- Sumesh!

679
00:38:08,067 --> 00:38:10,411
The water stopped.
Who closed the pipe?

680
00:38:10,534 --> 00:38:12,070
Oh! It was you?
- I can't see!

681
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,180
I'll son that out now.
Isn't it okay now?

682
00:38:16,567 --> 00:38:17,602
Oh no!

683
00:38:18,367 --> 00:38:20,278
Where are you going, Swamy?
- Toilet.

684
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,276
To the toilet?

685
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:25,348
Don't go today.
I won't let you go. Please don't go!

686
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,473
Please give me some way.
Let me go.

687
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,011
Hey! Go and get the iron box!

688
00:38:30,133 --> 00:38:31,703
Then I should go downstairs, right?

689
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,235
Oh God!

690
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,472
Iron box!
Leave it, dear.

691
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,671
Don't take it.
- Move away, I say!

692
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,746
Whatever you say, I
won't give this back.

693
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:44,705
Oh God!

694
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,980
- Where's the water?
- I'll come now!

695
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,276
See if you need anything else!
- Got it?

696
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,635
Okay. rig ht?

697
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,535
What happened?

698
00:39:00,433 --> 00:39:01,343
What is this?

699
00:39:01,467 --> 00:39:03,970
Attire for the performance!
Why? Is it loose?

700
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,777
She's not performing cabaret.

701
00:39:07,067 --> 00:39:07,977
It's Bharatnatyam!

702
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,636
Rest she can adjust
with a saree, rig ht?

703
00:39:09,767 --> 00:39:11,610
Is it a honeymoon room
to cover with a saree?

704
00:39:11,733 --> 00:39:13,041
We don't have time, right?

705
00:39:13,167 --> 00:39:14,544
What about the 'Vada'?
- Yes.

706
00:39:15,134 --> 00:39:16,169
Here.

707
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,374
Sorry.
- Careful.

708
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,204
Wow. Rasavada.

709
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,501
Is it too much?

710
00:39:22,633 --> 00:39:25,239
You bloody dog, scoundrel, fool, idiot!

711
00:39:25,367 --> 00:39:27,005
Here's your 'Vada'.
Eat it!

712
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,779
Eat it. Don't waste it.

713
00:39:30,134 --> 00:39:31,477
You're all betraying me!

714
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,375
What explanation
do I give her now!

715
00:39:34,267 --> 00:39:36,269
Bloody dog!
- Giving Vada is a problem now?

716
00:39:38,234 --> 00:39:40,145
Take him away!
- Come on!

717
00:39:40,267 --> 00:39:41,302
Come!

718
00:39:42,234 --> 00:39:43,372
Take this 'Vada' as well.

719
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,173
Him <i>&</i> his damn 'Vada'.

720
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,106
What?
- The attire & iron box.

721
00:39:50,133 --> 00:39:52,010
Oh! My bloody brother
in law is calling.

722
00:39:52,134 --> 00:39:53,169
What is it, brother?

723
00:39:53,767 --> 00:39:55,144
Everything is ready!

724
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:58,975
Video, stills, percussion;
everything is ready!

725
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,636
You've spoiled everything!

726
00:40:00,767 --> 00:40:02,246
Bloody scoundrel!

727
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,070
How do I face her
with this attire?

728
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,577
The girl is here.
Give her the dress.

729
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,270
Wearing the attire;

730
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,346
decked up in all the jewellery,

731
00:40:10,467 --> 00:40:12,606
To see your daughter like that.

732
00:40:13,034 --> 00:40:17,312
...Is like 500 Kalamandalams rushing
to the shore together, like waves...

733
00:40:17,434 --> 00:40:19,539
The side got burnt a bit..

734
00:40:23,067 --> 00:40:25,240
Wear this on top with
pants below it.

735
00:40:25,367 --> 00:40:28,041
It won't be noticeable.
It will look like a new design.

736
00:40:28,167 --> 00:40:29,077
Mom!

737
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,770
Oh! It was her mother's?
Then it's fine!

738
00:40:31,167 --> 00:40:32,202
Mom!

739
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,773
Mom!

740
00:40:37,067 --> 00:40:39,013
It's my daughter!
-It's from upstairs.

741
00:40:39,167 --> 00:40:40,612
Someone called 'Mom'!

742
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,435
I'll also come.

743
00:40:47,067 --> 00:40:48,569
Oh no!
My dear..

744
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:51,078
My daughterfell down..

745
00:40:51,467 --> 00:40:53,208
Is she sitting or
lying down on the steps?

746
00:40:53,334 --> 00:40:54,369
She fell down the stairs.

747
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,411
I won't go down.
- I won't go down at all.

748
00:40:56,534 --> 00:40:58,309
I won't go down.
- Pour water on her face.

749
00:40:58,434 --> 00:40:59,378
Where is he?

750
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,446
Call my damn brother!
- Please move.

751
00:41:01,567 --> 00:41:02,773
What happened?

752
00:41:03,067 --> 00:41:04,512
She slipped from the
stairs <i>&</i> fell down.

753
00:41:04,634 --> 00:41:06,341
How?
- Take her to the hospital.

754
00:41:06,467 --> 00:41:08,640
Where is Aravindan?
- I am here.

755
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,071
Brother in law is calling again.
- Pick up, Chetta.

756
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:14,576
Pick up!

757
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,236
Howdol pick up?
- Give it.

758
00:41:17,634 --> 00:41:19,545
Just pick up like this.

759
00:41:22,567 --> 00:41:23,602
Talk!

760
00:41:24,367 --> 00:41:25,778
Brother, I...

761
00:41:27,334 --> 00:41:28,608
Don't curse me like this!

762
00:41:31,367 --> 00:41:32,368
Son...

763
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:35,504
he's counting all the nerves one by one.
I'm getting scared.

764
00:41:35,633 --> 00:41:36,543
She will be fine.

765
00:41:36,667 --> 00:41:40,012
(speaking in Kannada)

766
00:41:40,734 --> 00:41:43,044
She will have to rest for 2 weeks.

767
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:44,202
What?

768
00:41:44,634 --> 00:41:47,046
What did he say?
- No. Nothing wrong.

769
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,638
Nothing wrong!

770
00:41:48,767 --> 00:41:50,678
But he spoke for a long time!

771
00:41:51,034 --> 00:41:52,445
Is the bone broken?

772
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,110
In medical language,

773
00:41:55,234 --> 00:41:56,713
it's a muscle - fiber - cracking.

774
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,206
In our language?

775
00:41:58,334 --> 00:42:00,610
In our language, below the
knee, just above the ankle,

776
00:42:00,734 --> 00:42:01,644
there's a severe problem!

777
00:42:01,767 --> 00:42:04,611
In his medical language,
he said crack, rig ht?

778
00:42:04,734 --> 00:42:07,305
I thought my girl fell down,
hit her head <i>&</i> became crazy!

779
00:42:07,434 --> 00:42:08,469
Mom!

780
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:11,180
You already are a little crazy, rig ht?

781
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,745
Well, mom just thought about it.

782
00:42:13,034 --> 00:42:15,173
There's no major problem.
You have to rest for some time.

783
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:18,008
And she can't travel or walk!

784
00:42:18,134 --> 00:42:19,044
Oh! That's all?

785
00:42:19,167 --> 00:42:20,145
What about my debut then?

786
00:42:20,267 --> 00:42:21,302
It won't happen soon, dear.

787
00:42:21,434 --> 00:42:23,345
It's not your wedding,
but your debut, right?

788
00:42:23,633 --> 00:42:26,011
Now we can stay here
peacefully for 2 weeks.

789
00:42:26,134 --> 00:42:27,272
Let me go arrange a wheel chair.

790
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,435
Get a good one!

791
00:42:29,234 --> 00:42:31,407
Get rid of this scary
expression <i>&</i> calm down, girl.

792
00:42:31,533 --> 00:42:33,308
And shut those scary round
eyes of yours!

793
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:39,307
This is the first time that I'm bringing
a guest of ours to the hospital.

794
00:42:39,434 --> 00:42:41,345
That's all right.
It will become a habit soon.

795
00:42:41,467 --> 00:42:43,504
Is Prabhakaran sir coming here?
- No.

796
00:42:43,634 --> 00:42:46,080
His leg is also broken.
- What happened?

797
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,702
He fell from the top of a wall.

798
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,343
Adog chased him up there.
- Oh no!

799
00:42:49,467 --> 00:42:50,343
What oh no?

800
00:42:50,467 --> 00:42:52,378
If you throw stones at a poor
dog, will it leave you alone?

801
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:55,174
Anyway, I'm disappointed that
the dog didn't bite him.

802
00:43:00,234 --> 00:43:02,009
Chechi!
- What is it?

803
00:43:02,133 --> 00:43:03,976
Brother-in-law is cussing
at me like anything!

804
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:06,376
You're used to it, rig ht?
It's not new!

805
00:43:06,567 --> 00:43:07,443
Oh no!

806
00:43:07,567 --> 00:43:09,171
No need to stay here, Madam.
- Then?

807
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:11,541
It will be difficult for Varada
to climb steps, right? -Yes.

808
00:43:11,667 --> 00:43:14,375
Madhavettan &I stay in the room
downstairs. We'll vacate that.

809
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,537
Won't that be troublesome for you?

810
00:43:16,667 --> 00:43:19,409
It's not bigger than the
trouble we caused for Varada.

811
00:43:20,234 --> 00:43:21,269
Ras heed..

812
00:43:22,034 --> 00:43:24,640
Call Sumesh and ask him
set up our room for them.

813
00:43:25,034 --> 00:43:26,479
I will talk to Madhavettan.

814
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:29,740
And take this prescription to the
pharmacy <i>&</i> buy the medicines too.

815
00:43:30,134 --> 00:43:31,169
Go fast!

816
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:32,535
Shall we leave?

817
00:43:32,734 --> 00:43:34,338
Move.
Let him turn it.

818
00:43:35,267 --> 00:43:36,473
Slowly, dear.
Hold tight.

819
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,341
Careful.
- There's a step there.

820
00:43:38,467 --> 00:43:39,502
Careful.

821
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:45,407
This is a nice room!

822
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:47,576
Nice, rig ht?

823
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:48,735
Nice.

824
00:43:50,067 --> 00:43:52,013
Don't stress your leg too much.

825
00:43:53,133 --> 00:43:54,168
Sit there.

826
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,970
Please m ove, Am m a.

827
00:43:57,067 --> 00:44:00,310
That plastered leg should be kept up.
- I have back pain. Should I lift it?

828
00:44:00,434 --> 00:44:01,469
Why can't you do it?

829
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,705
Your husband's 18 missed calls.
Call him back!

830
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,673
Take that shady fellow away!

831
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,438
Irritating fellow!

832
00:44:12,467 --> 00:44:14,140
Feels so good.
Hey girl!

833
00:44:14,334 --> 00:44:17,338
Click a photo of mine on your phone.
This is a good pose.

834
00:44:17,467 --> 00:44:19,174
Send it to that family group.

835
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:22,440
And say 'Mom relaxing at Mookambika'.
Let me shine!

836
00:44:22,567 --> 00:44:24,240
Let everyone see it.

837
00:44:24,367 --> 00:44:26,176
Let them see and get jealous.

838
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:28,473
Look at you!
Your dad's same frown!

839
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,240
You're as envious as him!

840
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:33,610
I'll call those who are
not in the group myself.

841
00:44:33,734 --> 00:44:35,577
I don't need your help for that!

842
00:44:39,034 --> 00:44:41,378
Souda..
It's me!

843
00:44:42,067 --> 00:44:43,102
How are you?

844
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:46,706
I'm at a big resort in Mookambika.

845
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,611
One..
What's the name, dear?

846
00:44:49,734 --> 00:44:51,475
Heritage!
- Ya. Heritage!

847
00:44:51,634 --> 00:44:53,136
It's a luxury resort!

848
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:56,244
Even though it's expensive,
can we change our habits?

849
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:58,577
The debut performance
didn't happen.

850
00:44:58,767 --> 00:45:00,644
She fell down from the
stairs <i>&</i> broke her leg.

851
00:45:00,767 --> 00:45:03,145
Why wouldn't she?
She walks looking at the sky!

852
00:45:03,334 --> 00:45:05,473
Artist, it seems!

853
00:45:05,634 --> 00:45:08,376
Oh.. The resort's MD is here.

854
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:11,242
He's a really busy person.
I'll call you back.

855
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,146
Why should I make it any lesser?

856
00:45:15,267 --> 00:45:16,302
Okay.

857
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:19,439
Tell me if you need anything.
- Okay.

858
00:45:19,733 --> 00:45:20,973
Hey son..

859
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:22,773
Are Malayalam magazines available here?
-Yes.

860
00:45:23,067 --> 00:45:23,977
Is it?
- Yes.

861
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:27,673
Then buy any one, or buy all the
ones that came out this month.

862
00:45:28,567 --> 00:45:29,978
Do you want anything?

863
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:34,513
Can I get the DVD of Janaki
Subramaniam's latest dance programme?

864
00:45:34,634 --> 00:45:36,511
Janaki Subramaniam, it seems.

865
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:39,479
Hey! Janaki Subramaniam's..
- Krishnaleela, right?

866
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,006
Yes.

867
00:45:41,334 --> 00:45:42,677
I have it.
I'll give you.

868
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:46,435
And son,

869
00:45:46,567 --> 00:45:48,410
buy 2 packets of Lays
also when you come.

870
00:45:48,533 --> 00:45:50,103
The green one!

871
00:45:52,267 --> 00:45:53,769
Good boy!
- Oh God!

872
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:56,737
Which colour Lays does she want?

873
00:45:57,467 --> 00:45:58,377
Green!

874
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:01,640
If anyone upstairs is left to fall,
make arrangements for that quickly.

875
00:46:01,767 --> 00:46:03,508
My room is there for
them to sleep, right?

876
00:46:22,734 --> 00:46:24,145
Who drew all these?

877
00:46:24,334 --> 00:46:25,369
Aravindan.

878
00:46:26,634 --> 00:46:30,446
(studying Kannada)

879
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,542
You won't listen when I tell you not to
stand for long with that leg of yours.

880
00:46:33,667 --> 00:46:35,738
Don't listen how many
ever times I tell you!

881
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,001
Hey Ras heed,

882
00:46:38,134 --> 00:46:40,614
a
a

883
00:46:40,734 --> 00:46:42,270
O Devi!

884
00:46:43,267 --> 00:46:44,302
Here. Keep it there.

885
00:46:44,433 --> 00:46:46,003
Hey“
- It's wrong!

886
00:46:46,133 --> 00:46:47,237
It's not like that.

887
00:46:47,367 --> 00:46:52,367
(recites in Kannada)

888
00:46:55,434 --> 00:46:57,744
(recites in Kannada)

889
00:46:58,034 --> 00:47:02,608
(repeats)

890
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:31,309
"My princess,
don't go away from me!"

891
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:38,140
"You should sing while
basking at the fireplace"

892
00:47:38,534 --> 00:47:46,214
"Oh my princess!"

893
00:47:46,334 --> 00:47:53,013
"Why did you come this way?"

894
00:47:53,400 --> 00:48:00,443
"Why did you perch on a
branch of my heart?"

895
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:07,651
"My princess,
don't go away from me!"

896
00:48:08,167 --> 00:48:11,774
"You should sing while
basking at the fireplace"

897
00:48:12,067 --> 00:48:13,205
Come, dear..

898
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:15,774
Oh! Madhavettan?

899
00:48:16,467 --> 00:48:18,378
I wanted to take a
couple of books.

900
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:19,535
Please take them.

901
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,479
I thought it was the boy..

902
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:27,211
What have you done?

903
00:48:27,334 --> 00:48:28,677
We've arranged our clothes.

904
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,370
See if it's lying there.

905
00:48:31,034 --> 00:48:31,774
Over there.

906
00:48:32,067 --> 00:48:34,513
Instead of piling up these
books <i>&</i> other waste,

907
00:48:34,634 --> 00:48:37,513
if you sell it as scrap, you'll get money.
Why have you kept them like this?

908
00:48:37,634 --> 00:48:41,013
Reading is good to acquire at
least a little common sense.

909
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:33,635
Move..

910
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:35,735
Let's go there.

911
00:49:39,034 --> 00:49:40,069
Aravindan!

912
00:49:41,267 --> 00:49:42,405
You reached?
- You have guests.

913
00:49:42,533 --> 00:49:44,035
I'm yet to go up on stage.

914
00:49:44,167 --> 00:49:45,976
Shall we keep him in the museum?

915
00:49:46,434 --> 00:49:48,675
Wow! Couldn't
recognize you at all!

916
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:49,710
Don't laug h.

917
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,172
Ask her not to laugh.

918
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:52,608
I'm going to go up on stage.
- There's still time.

919
00:49:52,734 --> 00:49:53,769
This is why your leg broke!

920
00:49:54,067 --> 00:49:56,069
Aren't you an artist? Is it right
to insult another artist like this?

921
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:57,736
But are you an artist?
- Dude!

922
00:50:27,434 --> 00:50:28,469
Got it?

923
00:50:28,633 --> 00:50:30,476
Are you a big fan of
Janaki Subramaniam?

924
00:50:30,733 --> 00:50:31,711
Die-hard fan!

925
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,445
M
E

926
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:18,215
"My princess,
don't go away from me!"

927
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:25,413
"You should sing while
basking at the fireplace"

928
00:51:25,534 --> 00:51:29,209
"Hey Princess"

929
00:51:29,334 --> 00:51:33,214
"Hey Princess"

930
00:51:33,334 --> 00:51:39,012
"Why did you come this way?"

931
00:51:39,167 --> 00:51:40,077
Look at you!

932
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:41,770
I've been waiting for
you for so long!

933
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:45,302
Shall we go?

934
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:54,679
"My princess,
don't go away from me!"

935
00:51:55,233 --> 00:52:02,173
"You should sing while
basking at the fireplace"

936
00:52:05,067 --> 00:52:06,603
How come you have a
'Tilak' on your forehead?

937
00:52:06,733 --> 00:52:08,542
I haven't seen this earlier.

938
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:10,305
Well.. When that girl...

939
00:52:10,434 --> 00:52:11,674
You're past that age!

940
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:13,006
To the market?

941
00:52:13,133 --> 00:52:14,703
No. To Keezhattoor.

942
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:22,371
So no one has come looking
forAravindan yet?

943
00:52:23,267 --> 00:52:24,439
Who's going to come?

944
00:52:25,267 --> 00:52:29,773
That mother who left her child in
between such a humongous crowd?

945
00:52:31,134 --> 00:52:32,135
Here.

946
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:34,371
Fooling that she will
show him the Devi,

947
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:37,413
she left that little child in between
the commotion of Navratri festival,

948
00:52:37,534 --> 00:52:39,275
and disappeared.

949
00:52:40,233 --> 00:52:42,338
Lucky that Mad havan
found him then.

950
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:45,235
Do you know, dear?

951
00:52:45,767 --> 00:52:48,646
He has never stepped inside
this temple, till date.

952
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:55,711
When this entire town celebrates
the Navratri festival every year,

953
00:52:56,067 --> 00:52:59,605
he will be there for everything,
laughing <i>&</i> smiling, during the day.

954
00:53:01,034 --> 00:53:03,742
But once it gets dark,
he will be all alone.

955
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:09,510
His own mother abandoning him.. Will that
disappear from the mind of any child?

956
00:53:12,233 --> 00:53:15,043
There are many people like me who
have been deserted by our families,

957
00:53:15,167 --> 00:53:16,168
in Mookambika.

958
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:19,507
But he might be the
only one who's living,

959
00:53:19,634 --> 00:53:22,240
not knowing the reason
for being abandoned.

960
00:53:29,267 --> 00:53:39,211
" My dear..
My mother, as beautiful as a flower"

961
00:54:10,167 --> 00:54:11,168
I was waiting to see you.

962
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:12,210
Why?

963
00:54:12,334 --> 00:54:14,336
When you draw people,
you should draw them well.

964
00:54:14,467 --> 00:54:15,707
Especially girls.

965
00:54:17,134 --> 00:54:18,044
What's wrong with this?

966
00:54:18,167 --> 00:54:20,147
It's just like a snake
which swallowed its prey.

967
00:54:20,267 --> 00:54:22,975
You are an artist, man!
You will reach great heights!

968
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:24,477
Your leg is all
right now, rig ht?

969
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:27,410
Before your debut, shall we
go for an adventure trip?

970
00:54:27,533 --> 00:54:28,705
Here?
- Yes.

971
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,741
In Mookambika?
Ad venture trip?

972
00:54:31,034 --> 00:54:32,012
Great!

973
00:54:32,134 --> 00:54:33,044
Let's go!

974
00:54:33,167 --> 00:54:34,703
So that you can see
my driving skills!

975
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,446
What if you see that, feel admiration
for me &want to marry me?

976
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:38,568
Mom is not here, right?

977
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:39,701
No. She's not here.

978
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,138
Is that necessary?

979
00:54:41,267 --> 00:54:43,144
No.
But let's go for the trip.

980
00:54:44,434 --> 00:54:45,469
Shall we go?

981
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,035
Okay.
- That's it!

982
00:54:53,534 --> 00:54:58,347
"0 Devi, the merciful"

983
00:54:58,467 --> 00:55:01,209
Didn't the Devi kill the demon
Mookasuran at Kudajadri?

984
00:55:01,334 --> 00:55:02,779
Which Devi?
When did she kill?

985
00:55:03,067 --> 00:55:05,013
She's talking about
Mookambika Devi, man.

986
00:55:05,134 --> 00:55:06,135
Is that so?

987
00:55:06,267 --> 00:55:08,144
What's the name of
the demon who died?

988
00:55:08,267 --> 00:55:09,245
Mookasuran.

989
00:55:09,367 --> 00:55:10,311
Moo kasuran?

990
00:55:10,433 --> 00:55:12,208
Couldn't they give
him a simple name?

991
00:55:12,333 --> 00:55:13,573
Then you suggest a simple name.

992
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:14,610
Like Hemanth..

993
00:55:14,734 --> 00:55:16,270
Babu or Sajeesh...

994
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:17,572
Sajees hasuran..
Simple, right?

995
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:19,680
Ya right! That's a perfect
name for a demon!

996
00:55:20,233 --> 00:55:22,270
Even after coming here on
trips for so many years,

997
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:25,074
you don't know anything
about Kudajadri?

998
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,474
Don't say that.

999
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:28,079
I know many things!

1000
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:31,147
I know that it's 4406
feet above sea level,

1001
00:55:31,267 --> 00:55:33,372
and we can go there
only on a Mahindra Jeep;

1002
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:36,208
and that once we reach the top, we'll
keep bumping into Malayalis.

1003
00:55:36,334 --> 00:55:37,779
I know all that!
- Oh no! Watch out!

1004
00:55:38,067 --> 00:55:38,977
Another Jeep!

1005
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:40,977
I saw it, girl.
-Are you planning to kill us?

1006
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:42,170
No. To raise you!

1007
00:55:43,067 --> 00:55:45,638
Even 90 year old grandmas
climb up the hill so easily!

1008
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:48,007
For that you need devotion!

1009
00:55:48,334 --> 00:55:50,143
Dedication!

1010
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:54,344
Oh my God!

1011
00:55:54,467 --> 00:55:59,439
"0 Devi, the merciful"

1012
00:55:59,567 --> 00:56:00,705
Phew! It's flat again.

1013
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,638
Who? You?
- No. The road.

1014
00:56:07,434 --> 00:56:08,469
Shall we get down?

1015
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:12,506
Oh God!

1016
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:22,077
Aren't you coming?
- No.

1017
00:56:22,234 --> 00:56:24,077
What happened?
- You carry on.

1018
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:25,406
You'll understand
after some time.

1019
00:56:25,533 --> 00:56:27,274
Dude, come give us company.

1020
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:29,236
Company! Ya right!
Go ahead!

1021
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:33,644
"The bird who opens the
door to a beautiful night"

1022
00:56:33,767 --> 00:56:36,441
" Get going, my dear bird"

1023
00:56:59,067 --> 00:57:00,102
How is it?

1024
00:57:01,167 --> 00:57:02,771
Reserve some of that wonder.

1025
00:57:03,267 --> 00:57:04,644
There's more?
- Com e.

1026
00:57:07,034 --> 00:57:15,249
" I shall travel far away
distances with you"

1027
00:57:15,367 --> 00:57:24,344
" We're joining each other
unknowingly, like clouds"

1028
00:57:32,167 --> 00:57:33,737
Nam aste Swami.
- Namaste.

1029
00:57:34,034 --> 00:57:34,774
He's the priest here.

1030
00:57:35,067 --> 00:57:36,410
This hill that we climbed now?

1031
00:57:36,667 --> 00:57:38,169
He climbs it 4 times daily.

1032
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:39,677
He doesn't have any
other job or what?

1033
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:42,041
This is his job.
Performing the rituals here.

1034
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:00,545
Shankaracharya..

1035
00:58:01,267 --> 00:58:02,644
The place where he meditated?

1036
00:58:04,567 --> 00:58:06,342
Sarvanja Peetha..
(The throne of wisdom)

1037
00:58:09,367 --> 00:58:11,210
Go and sit there
for ten minutes.

1038
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:12,635
Go!

1039
00:58:14,333 --> 00:58:22,582
" I shall travel far away
distances with you"

1040
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:31,643
" We're joining each other
unknowingly, like clouds"

1041
00:58:31,767 --> 00:58:40,118
" There's joy all around..
There's joy in everything..."

1042
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:48,515
" There's joy all around..
There's joy in everything..."

1043
00:58:48,634 --> 00:58:56,780
" There's joy all around..
There's joy in everything..."

1044
00:58:57,134 --> 00:59:05,713
" There's joy all around..
There's joy in everything..."

1045
00:59:08,767 --> 00:59:10,678
Yes. 'Mother, please'
is a great hit.

1046
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:14,208
2nd pan is coming soon.
'Mother, please give something'

1047
00:59:15,767 --> 00:59:16,973
I'll call you back.

1048
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:23,146
Geo rgetta, three cups of tea.
- Okay.

1049
00:59:23,467 --> 00:59:24,377
How are you, Dada?

1050
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:26,002
I'm all right.

1051
00:59:26,633 --> 00:59:27,543
How was my drive?

1052
00:59:27,667 --> 00:59:28,577
Superb!

1053
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:30,407
Superb for those who watch.
- Aravindan!

1054
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:33,180
I told you about the song, right?
Did you tell her?

1055
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:34,472
I'll tell now.
- Please.

1056
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:36,045
Have you brought the CD?
- Who's this guy?

1057
00:59:36,167 --> 00:59:38,078
A mam

1058
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:39,076
Va rad a,

1059
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,076
that's Srikrishnan.

1060
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:43,545
He's a Malayali who composes
songs and sells CD's here.

1061
00:59:43,667 --> 00:59:44,702
Innocent chap.

1062
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,441
He came to know that you're
from Kalamandalam somehow.

1063
00:59:47,733 --> 00:59:49,440
He has composed a song.

1064
00:59:49,567 --> 00:59:53,709
So he told me to ask you if you can do
dance choreography for that song video.

1065
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:54,978
Can you do it?

1066
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:56,272
Will I get money?

1067
00:59:57,100 --> 00:59:59,444
I've told him that you're the
best choreographer in Kerala.

1068
00:59:59,567 --> 01:00:00,637
You'll get good money.

1069
01:00:02,367 --> 01:00:03,311
Please...

1070
01:00:03,434 --> 01:00:06,608
What if he checks the internet <i>&</i>
find out that I'm not famous?

1071
01:00:06,733 --> 01:00:08,269
Look at his face!

1072
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:11,410
Do you think he knows that
something called internet exists?

1073
01:00:11,534 --> 01:00:12,774
"O. right?
- No way!

1074
01:00:13,067 --> 01:00:14,637
So let's listen to it?
- Of course!

1075
01:00:17,334 --> 01:00:18,312
Then let's listen to it.

1076
01:00:18,434 --> 01:00:19,469
Here you go, madam.

1077
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:01,702
Can you recognize the person?
- No.

1078
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,206
Aravindan, come fast.
- What happened?

1079
01:01:03,334 --> 01:01:04,779
Someone pushed this
lady down here.

1080
01:01:05,067 --> 01:01:07,206
Someone snatched my
bag <i>&</i> ran away, son.

1081
01:01:07,333 --> 01:01:09,142
They took everything!

1082
01:01:09,267 --> 01:01:10,575
Shall we take her to the hospital?

1083
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:12,373
Not the hospital, let's take
her to the guest house.

1084
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:15,572
Then let's check the surveillance
camera of the temple.

1085
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:17,441
Then let's enquire.
Don't worry at all, aunty.

1086
01:01:17,567 --> 01:01:19,137
We'll see.
Com e.

1087
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:28,306
What kind of children are you?

1088
01:01:28,433 --> 01:01:30,674
You brought your mother to
pray & left her at the temple?

1089
01:01:35,267 --> 01:01:37,008
Poor thing.
She got really scared.

1090
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:39,335
Okay.

1091
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:42,680
Did you like this place, Varada?
- Yes.

1092
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:52,745
What hurts us the most is a long
wait for something or someone.

1093
01:02:53,034 --> 01:02:54,069
Isn't it?

1094
01:02:55,534 --> 01:02:57,741
Have you ever felt angry
towards your mother?

1095
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:07,138
She left me at everyone's
mother's courtyard, right?

1096
01:03:09,067 --> 01:03:10,102
It's all right!

1097
01:03:15,467 --> 01:03:18,311
To see you stepping inside the
temple, holding your mother's hand...

1098
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:22,146
All those who love you, are
wishing for it to happen.

1099
01:03:30,434 --> 01:03:31,412
<i>Wow'!</i>

1100
01:03:31,533 --> 01:03:33,376
You're looking gorgeous!

1101
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:34,535
Turn this side..

1102
01:03:35,334 --> 01:03:37,336
A mam

1103
01:03:37,567 --> 01:03:39,774
Didn't you tie your hair yet?
Don't you have to keep flowers?

1104
01:03:40,067 --> 01:03:42,240
Hey! Don't you want jasmine flowers?
- No Chechi.

1105
01:03:42,367 --> 01:03:43,675
I'll get reminded
of my wedding day!

1106
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:45,108
I didn't see Aravindan yet.

1107
01:03:45,234 --> 01:03:47,373
He will reach there when it's
time for the performance.

1108
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:50,003
He won't step inside
the temple, dear.

1109
01:03:50,434 --> 01:03:51,640
Didn't I tell you?

1110
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:53,735
Poor thing.

1111
01:04:02,367 --> 01:04:03,277
Aravindan!

1112
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:04,401
Come here..
- What is it?

1113
01:04:04,534 --> 01:04:05,706
Come here.
- What's the matter?

1114
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,035
It's urgent!

1115
01:04:07,434 --> 01:04:09,311
Mallika, I'll be right back.

1116
01:04:09,434 --> 01:04:10,310
Okay.

1117
01:04:10,434 --> 01:04:11,504
Com e.
- What's the matter?

1118
01:04:11,633 --> 01:04:12,668
I'll tell you..

1119
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:23,672
It's from this..

1120
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,377
'Bull' Chet-ta“
Oh no!

1121
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:35,070
Prabhetta"

1122
01:04:36,767 --> 01:04:37,973
Sigh!

1123
01:04:38,733 --> 01:04:43,546
He was reading a newspaper <i>&</i>
drinking tea in the morning at 6 AM.

1124
01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:44,735
And that was it.

1125
01:04:45,534 --> 01:04:48,344
That's all our lives are!
You drink your tea!

1126
01:04:53,534 --> 01:04:56,276
No need to book tickets on
today's bus itself urgently.

1127
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:57,435
Take your time.

1128
01:04:57,733 --> 01:05:00,976
Us, from Kottayam-Pathanamthitta
NRI districts,

1129
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:02,340
If someone dies,

1130
01:05:02,467 --> 01:05:05,710
we keep the dead body in the morgue
for 5-6 days minimum, just like that.

1131
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:06,705
Why is that?

1132
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,035
Just for a show off!

1133
01:05:08,167 --> 01:05:09,669
For show off, you can
keep wreaths, rig ht?

1134
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:11,245
No. That's not enough!

1135
01:05:11,434 --> 01:05:16,611
It's a trick to make the town realize that
this dead body has many relatives abroad.

1136
01:05:16,734 --> 01:05:18,736
Oh! Show off during death!
- Exactly!

1137
01:05:19,167 --> 01:05:20,544
It's not that.

1138
01:05:22,734 --> 01:05:23,769
Prabhetta, l..

1139
01:05:25,067 --> 01:05:26,671
Won't let me say anything.
He talks like an announcement.

1140
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:28,677
Varada really liked
her uncle, huh?

1141
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:29,710
Ya rig m!

1142
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,071
She's the one who cursed <i>&</i>
killed that bloody old bloke!

1143
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:33,474
You're wondering why she's crying?

1144
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:35,409
That's because her debut
got cancelled again.

1145
01:05:35,534 --> 01:05:38,276
She can enter the temple only after
the 16th day ritual now, rig ht?

1146
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:40,038
That's why she's crying.

1147
01:05:40,667 --> 01:05:43,204
Anyway, we will also
pray for uncle's soul.

1148
01:05:43,334 --> 01:05:44,608
My dear children, please don't!

1149
01:05:44,734 --> 01:05:46,475
We sent him up somehow.

1150
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:49,080
He was 96 not out!
- Just miss!

1151
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:50,110
A century, I mean!

1152
01:05:50,234 --> 01:05:51,235
Yes. We're relieved now.

1153
01:05:51,367 --> 01:05:53,176
Move. Let me go check on
her, if she's crying.

1154
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:54,335
What is this, man?

1155
01:05:57,100 --> 01:05:59,376
There will be vacancy, sir.
I'll give you your regular room.

1156
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:02,310
I should cut this hair &take
a stylish photo for this.

1157
01:06:02,434 --> 01:06:04,277
Aravindan, where are you coming from?
- I had to go to Baindur.

1158
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:05,572
Oh! The DVD is ready?

1159
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:07,145
Editing is over.
- Great!

1160
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:08,735
Shankaranna,

1161
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:11,235
make it fast!

1162
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:14,344
Can't you change this chair, Shankaretta?
It's been so long!

1163
01:06:14,467 --> 01:06:16,174
Let the season start.
I'll change everything.

1164
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:17,370
Season, it seems!

1165
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:20,970
As if people come here on Navratri to
get hair-cuts! Stop kidding, brother.

1166
01:06:22,734 --> 01:06:24,543
Oh! You're about to reach?

1167
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,240
Okay. I'll come.

1168
01:06:26,534 --> 01:06:28,673
Shankaranna, not today.
I'll come tomorrow

1169
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:30,477
See you later.
- You're leaving?

1170
01:06:31,434 --> 01:06:33,209
Came, sat and left.

1171
01:06:33,634 --> 01:06:35,773
That's a nice title.
I'll name my next album that.

1172
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:40,135
What did you pray for?

1173
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:41,574
What I pray for all the time.

1174
01:06:41,767 --> 01:06:44,247
To learn dance under the
person I admire the most.

1175
01:06:45,033 --> 01:06:45,773
Who's that?

1176
01:06:46,067 --> 01:06:46,977
Prabhu Deva?

1177
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:48,135
Not Prabhu Deva.

1178
01:06:48,467 --> 01:06:51,414
The renowned classical dancer,
Janaki Subramaniam.

1179
01:06:59,367 --> 01:07:02,314
2016 November 29
Kanhika

1180
01:07:38,434 --> 01:07:46,478
" There's joy all around..
There's joy in everything..."

1181
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:55,384
" There's joy all around..
There's joy in everything..."

1182
01:07:55,500 --> 01:08:03,146
" There's joy all around..
There's joy in everything..."

1183
01:08:03,267 --> 01:08:08,267
" There's joy all around..
There's joy in everything..."

1184
01:08:27,667 --> 01:08:28,702
Varada, right?

1185
01:08:30,767 --> 01:08:33,270
Aravindan told me that
you're really depressed!

1186
01:08:35,167 --> 01:08:36,612
Once your debut
performance is over,

1187
01:08:36,734 --> 01:08:39,681
you'll do a lot of programmes
as Kalamandalam Varada.

1188
01:08:40,067 --> 01:08:42,013
Once you're fed up with
that, you'll get married.

1189
01:08:42,134 --> 01:08:43,477
Is that your plan?

1190
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:44,705
No Madam.

1191
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,105
I want to learn dance from you.

1192
01:08:47,734 --> 01:08:50,214
Whom you study from,
is not important.

1193
01:08:50,334 --> 01:08:52,143
We should always keep studying.

1194
01:08:52,267 --> 01:08:53,143
That's what is important.

1195
01:08:53,267 --> 01:08:54,177
Rig ht Aravindan?

1196
01:08:54,300 --> 01:08:55,301
That's correct, mad am.

1197
01:08:55,434 --> 01:08:56,469
Come here.

1198
01:08:57,300 --> 01:08:58,335
Com e.

1199
01:08:58,467 --> 01:08:59,502
Well..

1200
01:09:00,367 --> 01:09:01,402
What?

1201
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:04,237
You're bringing a girl
and trying to trap me?

1202
01:09:04,367 --> 01:09:05,402
Sughtlv~

1203
01:09:18,734 --> 01:09:20,270
She asked me to
give this to you.

1204
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:21,635
Here.

1205
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:24,235
Open <i>&</i> see!

1206
01:09:34,567 --> 01:09:36,012
Have you been to Kumbakonam?

1207
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:39,506
It's quite far from Kerala.

1208
01:09:40,634 --> 01:09:42,443
But without travelling that far,

1209
01:09:43,034 --> 01:09:46,572
you won't be able to join Janaki
Subramaniam's dance academy.

1210
01:09:48,134 --> 01:09:49,169
What do we do then?

1211
01:09:52,467 --> 01:09:53,707
Are you interested?

1212
01:10:00,267 --> 01:10:09,210
" There's joy all around..
There's joy in everything..."

1213
01:10:09,334 --> 01:10:11,678
E
a

1214
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:15,545
Send me a lot of photos of my
daughter and grandchildren.

1215
01:10:15,667 --> 01:10:17,374
Didn't you say that they stay near you?
- Yes.

1216
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:20,208
I badly want to see all of them!

1217
01:10:20,367 --> 01:10:23,576
I wonder how big my children would be now.
- I'll click and send.

1218
01:10:23,700 --> 01:10:25,373
Malli..
- Shall I put this in?

1219
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:28,208
No. Inside the bag..
I'll come.

1220
01:10:32,801 --> 01:10:34,212
Well, well!

1221
01:10:34,534 --> 01:10:36,275
You came here like a tiger!

1222
01:10:36,434 --> 01:10:38,209
Now you've become like a rabbit.

1223
01:10:41,367 --> 01:10:42,573
There's another tiger at home.

1224
01:10:42,700 --> 01:10:44,043
I'll bring him next time I come.

1225
01:10:44,167 --> 01:10:45,510
You should turn him
also into a rabbit.

1226
01:10:45,634 --> 01:10:47,511
Did you mean my brother
in law Prabhakaran?

1227
01:10:48,167 --> 01:10:50,579
He's not a tiger. He's a bull!
- Shut up!

1228
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:53,271
You're always speaking
ill about him!

1229
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:54,435
Oh! Respect!

1230
01:10:54,567 --> 01:10:57,173
Here, son. The hospital expense,
rent, everything is there.

1231
01:10:57,300 --> 01:10:59,211
That wasn't necessary.
- Then give that money to me.

1232
01:10:59,334 --> 01:11:00,711
Isn't that sad?
- For whom?

1233
01:11:01,001 --> 01:11:01,979
Me!

1234
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:03,101
That's it!

1235
01:11:03,234 --> 01:11:05,214
Learn from the kids!
- I'll go get the luggage.

1236
01:11:09,167 --> 01:11:10,202
Mad havetta"

1237
01:11:14,667 --> 01:11:15,737
To be frank..

1238
01:11:16,034 --> 01:11:18,139
When I stayed here for
some time with you people,

1239
01:11:18,334 --> 01:11:20,314
I doubt if I've become
slightly decent now.

1240
01:11:20,434 --> 01:11:22,072
That's just a doubt of yours!

1241
01:11:23,667 --> 01:11:24,702
Mad havetta, we' re leaving.

1242
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,640
So we'll get our room back.
- Yes.

1243
01:11:28,034 --> 01:11:30,014
We'll come again though.
- You should.

1244
01:11:30,534 --> 01:11:31,569
Okay then.

1245
01:11:32,101 --> 01:11:33,774
Mad havetta, see you.

1246
01:11:37,167 --> 01:11:38,976
Shall we click a selfie, Madhavetta?

1247
01:11:39,334 --> 01:11:42,338
I'm used to giving autographs
to girls who come here.

1248
01:11:43,434 --> 01:11:45,311
But selfie is more comfortable.

1249
01:11:47,567 --> 01:11:49,274
You can delete it anytime.

1250
01:11:52,167 --> 01:11:54,010
I'm not going to
delete it, Madhavetta.

1251
01:11:54,501 --> 01:11:56,674
Wow! I look really good!

1252
01:11:57,667 --> 01:12:00,341
Varada, you should
improve a little more.

1253
01:12:03,667 --> 01:12:04,702
Mad havetta"

1254
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:10,348
Have you ever wished that someone
should come looking for Aravindan?

1255
01:12:19,167 --> 01:12:25,709
"Why did you come this way?"

1256
01:12:26,234 --> 01:12:32,981
"Why did you perch on a
branch of my heart?"

1257
01:12:46,700 --> 01:12:47,678
Hey Thangavelu..

1258
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:49,143
Keep this bag.

1259
01:12:49,267 --> 01:12:50,177
Bye, son.

1260
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:52,405
Next time we come, you should
take us to the temple.

1261
01:12:53,134 --> 01:12:54,704
You sit here, Chechi.

1262
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,035
Okay then.

1263
01:12:56,234 --> 01:13:03,277
"My princess,
don't go away from me!"

1264
01:13:03,534 --> 01:13:10,474
"You should sing while
basking at the fireplace"

1265
01:13:23,501 --> 01:13:26,971
A great place to stay, 24 hours
security, hot water, homely food..

1266
01:13:27,101 --> 01:13:32,380
"Why did you come this way?"

1267
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:37,543
'An interval for the guests'

1268
01:13:38,567 --> 01:13:40,205
'Prabhakar House'

1269
01:13:43,134 --> 01:13:46,411
Chetta, don't irritate anyone on the way.
Come back soon.

1270
01:13:57,134 --> 01:13:58,613
'Bull' Prabhakaran!

1271
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:01,535
Here's the bull!

1272
01:14:02,534 --> 01:14:03,672
I should have worn a mundu.

1273
01:14:11,334 --> 01:14:13,405
Who has thrown
waste on the road?

1274
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:17,702
Which scoundrel threw
waste on my courtyard?

1275
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,071
Tomorrow I'll let the
dog loose, you dog!

Eta
E

1277
01:14:23,367 --> 01:14:25,313
Did he steal anything?
- He didn't steal anything.

1278
01:14:25,434 --> 01:14:26,708
She saw him.

1279
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,138
Are you sure it was a thief?

1280
01:14:28,667 --> 01:14:30,305
Don't misunderstand me.

1281
01:14:32,201 --> 01:14:33,236
You..

1282
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,035
Tea!

1283
01:14:36,100 --> 01:14:36,976
One,

1284
01:14:37,101 --> 01:14:38,239
He started his session!

1285
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:40,010
Tea!

1286
01:14:40,134 --> 01:14:41,545
Two!
- The thunder has struck.

1287
01:14:41,734 --> 01:14:44,544
The newspaper has only shady news,
right in the morning.

1288
01:14:44,667 --> 01:14:45,577
Tea!

1289
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:46,610
Three!

1290
01:14:46,734 --> 01:14:49,510
If it doesn't reach him before the
rain, there will be destruction!

1291
01:14:50,101 --> 01:14:51,011
Tea!

1292
01:14:51,134 --> 01:14:52,044
Sadly he's my son.

1293
01:14:52,167 --> 01:14:54,340
If he was my husband,
I'd have poisoned him.

1294
01:14:54,467 --> 01:14:55,502
Mom!

1295
01:14:56,467 --> 01:14:59,676
If you had thought this 50 years back,
me <i>&</i> my child would have escaped.

1296
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:01,166
And you had this revelation
only when you're old?

1297
01:15:01,167 --> 01:15:02,111

Come.
Enough!

1307

They want to burst crackers
in the middle of the road?

1308
01:15:28,767 --> 01:15:31,373
Oh no! They'll destroy my eardrum!

We'll go to my house, have lunch and
only then we'll go elsewhere.

The food was great!

There was a red curry with brinjal

Sam bar?

Before the Mahabharata
war began,

while Kama was performing
his prayers to the Sun God,

1377
01:18:56,167 --> 01:19:00,172
The episode in which his mother
Kunti comes to meet him there.

1378

This is going to be
my new composition.

1379
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:04,740
Son, Kama...

1380
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:09,309
the reason for all the humiliation
that you're experiencing now,

1381
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:11,205
is this mother of yours, son.

1382
01:19:11,634 --> 01:19:13,307
Please forgive me, son.

1383
01:19:13,700 --> 01:19:16,271
The scene where she yearns
to say that to him.

1384
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:19,413
It's a performance in which
expressions are really important.

1385
01:19:20,401 --> 01:19:21,436
Motherhood"

1386
01:19:22,501 --> 01:19:24,139
Motherhood is a language.

1387
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:27,380
It's an international language.

1388
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:36,279
Good evening Ma'am.

1389
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:39,036
Ma'am..

1390
01:19:40,267 --> 01:19:46,115
In all your compositions so far, you had
concentrated on devotion and love..

1391
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:48,411
Why did you choose such
a subject this time?

1392
01:20:22,767 --> 01:20:24,337
She's doing it good.

1393
01:20:25,367 --> 01:20:27,040
You are really graceful.

1394
01:20:27,700 --> 01:20:28,735
<i>Shiv ram . .</i>

1395
01:20:32,501 --> 01:20:34,572
I wanna try out something
different this time.

1396
01:20:45,301 --> 01:20:47,144
Madam is unmarried, right?

1397
01:20:47,434 --> 01:20:50,313
Madam got married when
she was really young.

1398
01:20:50,434 --> 01:20:51,538
She has a son as well.

1399
01:20:51,667 --> 01:20:52,611
When did she come here?

1400
01:20:52,734 --> 01:20:55,374
It's been many years since
Madam settled in Kumbakonam.

1401
01:20:55,501 --> 01:20:57,310
Okay. The next session
is at 3 o'clock.

1402
01:20:57,434 --> 01:20:58,708
See you later.

1403
01:21:08,434 --> 01:21:09,572
What about Madam's husband?

1404
01:21:09,700 --> 01:21:10,735
I don't know why“.

1405
01:21:11,034 --> 01:21:13,480
No one here knows much
about her husband.

1406
01:21:13,667 --> 01:21:15,203
Why did they separate then?

1407
01:21:15,334 --> 01:21:17,507
Her husband told her
not to dance ever again.

1408
01:21:17,634 --> 01:21:18,510
And then?

1409
01:21:18,634 --> 01:21:20,545
Madam left everything
and came here.

1410
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:40,370
So what about her son?

1411
01:21:40,734 --> 01:21:41,769
I don't know.

1412
01:22:20,334 --> 01:22:22,007
Where is Madam's husband now?

1413
01:22:22,134 --> 01:22:23,169
I don't know that.

1414
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:24,244
He's a Kannadiga.

1415
01:22:24,367 --> 01:22:26,404
And Madam is an Udupi
Tullu Brahmin.

1416
01:22:26,700 --> 01:22:29,010
So she's not that connected
to her family, is it?

1417
01:22:29,134 --> 01:22:30,613
I don't know all that.

1418
01:22:30,734 --> 01:22:34,181
But she keeps going to Kollur
Mookambika temple frequently.

1419
01:22:42,767 --> 01:22:43,711
Right, Aravindan?

1420
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,035
That's correct, Madam.

1421
01:22:45,234 --> 01:22:46,269
Come here.

1422
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:50,243
Can I get the DVD of Janaki
Subramaniam's latest dance programme?

1423
01:22:50,434 --> 01:22:51,469
Krishna-Leela, right?

1424
01:22:51,601 --> 01:22:52,636
I have it with me.

1425
01:23:03,367 --> 01:23:04,505
Surya...

1426
01:23:04,801 --> 01:23:06,246
...cultural...

1427
01:23:10,734 --> 01:23:14,147
Surya Cultural Society,

1428
01:23:14,267 --> 01:23:15,245
He's a Kannadiga.

1429
01:23:15,367 --> 01:23:17,506
And Madam is an Udupi Tullu Brahmin.

1430
01:23:18,767 --> 01:23:20,440
I don't know all that.

1431
01:23:20,634 --> 01:23:23,979
But she keeps going to Kollur
Mookambika temple frequently.

1432
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:27,713
Madam got married when
she was really young.

1433
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,445
She has a son as well.

1434
01:23:33,500 --> 01:23:33,600
2017 August 14
5244th Krishna Birth Anniversary

1435
01:23:33,601 --> 01:23:35,979
2017 August 14
5244th Krishna Birth Anniversary

1436
01:23:49,201 --> 01:23:50,373
Varada, I've reached.

1437
01:23:50,634 --> 01:23:51,669
At Udupi stand.

1438
01:23:52,034 --> 01:23:53,069
Hello?

1439
01:23:53,434 --> 01:23:54,777
Can you talk loudly?

1440
01:23:55,534 --> 01:23:57,104
Hello?
I can't hear you.

1441
01:24:03,367 --> 01:24:04,573
Com e.
- Where?

1442
01:24:04,700 --> 01:24:05,735
Come.
I'll tell you.

1443
01:24:07,101 --> 01:24:08,478
So this is Aravindan.

1444
01:24:09,267 --> 01:24:10,302
This is Reenu,

1445
01:24:10,767 --> 01:24:12,269
Res hm a, As hwi ni.

1446
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:13,777
She's from Udupi.
- Hi.

1447
01:24:14,401 --> 01:24:15,539
So I'll see you later?
- Okay.

1448
01:24:15,667 --> 01:24:16,668
Here. Hold this.

1449
01:24:17,234 --> 01:24:19,077
This has a brake, right?
- See for yourself.

1450
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:20,304
You all go to the hostel then.

1451
01:24:20,434 --> 01:24:21,469
Come when I call you.

1452
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:23,310
Com e.

1453
01:24:23,434 --> 01:24:24,378
Where to?

1454
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:25,672
There's a surprise.
Com e.

1455
01:24:27,067 --> 01:24:28,068
Hop on!

1456
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:30,435
See you!

1457
01:24:57,167 --> 01:25:00,444
This is where you grew up
till you were 5 years old.

1458
01:25:05,734 --> 01:25:08,146
Don't you want to see someone
whom you were waiting to see,

1459
01:25:08,267 --> 01:25:09,211
for all these years?

1460
01:25:09,334 --> 01:25:10,369
Com e.

1461
01:25:19,001 --> 01:25:20,036
Go!

1462
01:26:10,567 --> 01:26:11,978
What are you thinking?

1463
01:26:16,034 --> 01:26:17,707
Have you had the famous
Udupi Masala Dosa?

1464
01:26:20,100 --> 01:26:21,135
Sweets from Ud up I?

1465
01:26:23,634 --> 01:26:25,272
No.
- You haven't?

1466
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:26,535
No.

1467
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:28,235
Com e.

1468
01:26:37,167 --> 01:26:38,339
Awesome, right?

1469
01:26:41,534 --> 01:26:43,605
Do you want to see Janaki
Subramaniam's son?

1470
01:26:50,101 --> 01:26:51,136
<i>Vwek wet.</i>

1471
01:26:51,667 --> 01:26:52,975
llT Kanpur.

1472
01:26:53,567 --> 01:26:54,978
He's in the US now.

1473
01:26:55,667 --> 01:26:57,408
She hasn't disowned her son.

1474
01:26:58,167 --> 01:26:59,441
Personal life..

1475
01:27:00,301 --> 01:27:02,440
She just doesn't discuss her
personal life anywhere.

1476
01:27:02,567 --> 01:27:03,978
She doesn't have to, right?

1477
01:27:09,501 --> 01:27:11,242
You feel like saying
a sorry, rig ht?

1478
01:27:13,667 --> 01:27:14,702
It's all right.

1479
01:27:15,567 --> 01:27:17,342
Have some more sweets.

1480
01:27:17,667 --> 01:27:19,544
It's amazing.
You won't get it anywhere else.

1481
01:27:19,667 --> 01:27:20,702
You'll get it only here.

1482
01:27:39,300 --> 01:27:40,677
Apart from waiting like this,

1483
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,537
have you ever felt like going
in search of your mother?

1484
01:28:40,467 --> 01:28:44,210
I still don't know why
my mother abandoned me.

1485
01:28:46,367 --> 01:28:49,143
I may be able to find her,
if I go searching for her.

1486
01:28:50,167 --> 01:28:51,669
But once I search and find her,

1487
01:28:52,634 --> 01:28:54,375
and finally when I confront her,

1488
01:28:55,501 --> 01:28:56,536
my mother..

1489
01:28:59,401 --> 01:29:01,403
What if my mother says
that she doesn't know me?

1490
01:29:06,601 --> 01:29:09,013
What if my mother is living,

1491
01:29:10,200 --> 01:29:13,044
in a condition that no son in the
world would wish to see her in?

1492
01:29:15,467 --> 01:29:17,003
Didn't you say once...

1493
01:29:17,501 --> 01:29:20,505
...that what hurts us the most is a
long wait for something or someone?

1494
01:29:23,334 --> 01:29:25,336
What hurts more
than a long wait,

1495
01:29:26,467 --> 01:29:28,174
is when that wait
comes to an end.

1496
01:29:33,034 --> 01:29:34,672
Wearing the only
old Saree she had,

1497
01:29:34,801 --> 01:29:36,474
With a beautiful smile on her face,

1498
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:40,413
My mother used to call me
'Aravinda' and hug me!

1499
01:29:42,567 --> 01:29:44,205
I won't go in search
of that mother.

1500
01:29:48,367 --> 01:29:49,710
If she is alive,

1501
01:29:51,067 --> 01:29:52,375
she will come searching for me.

1502
01:29:54,467 --> 01:29:55,445
Someday.

1503
01:29:55,567 --> 01:30:00,567
" Aren't you somewhere far away in the sky,
blinking your eyes like a star?"

1504
01:30:17,034 --> 01:30:22,034
"Come! Come!"
"Those calls of yours"

1505
01:30:28,467 --> 01:30:36,318
"This breeze is spreading
them in my ears"

1506
01:30:38,534 --> 01:30:40,411
Oh God!

1507
01:30:40,567 --> 01:30:42,979
Who gave you permission to
do all this investigation?

1508
01:30:44,534 --> 01:30:46,207
We don't know who his father is.

1509
01:30:46,534 --> 01:30:48,138
His mother abandoned him.

1510
01:30:48,401 --> 01:30:50,779
Did you consider the pain
that boy is going through?

1511
01:30:51,767 --> 01:30:53,246
I'll tell you something!

1512
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:55,505
Don't interfere in any of
his matters hereafter.

1513
01:30:56,701 --> 01:31:00,046
Let him live at least with the hope
that his mother would return someday.

1514
01:31:01,134 --> 01:31:02,169
Understood?

1515
01:31:07,401 --> 01:31:09,244
His very own mother
abandoning him..

1516
01:31:09,367 --> 01:31:11,540
Will it ever disappear
from any child's mind?

1517
01:31:14,334 --> 01:31:16,473
No one has come in search
ofAravindan so far?

1518
01:31:17,034 --> 01:31:18,308
Who's going to come?

1519
01:31:18,434 --> 01:31:19,412
Mom!

1520
01:31:19,534 --> 01:31:23,710
I want to go to my mom!
I want to see my mom!

1521
01:31:24,267 --> 01:31:29,148
That mother who left her child in
between such a humongous crowd?

1522
01:31:29,734 --> 01:31:33,079
My mother used to call me
'Aravinda' and hug me!

1523
01:31:34,367 --> 01:31:36,176
I won't go in search of that mother.

1524
01:31:58,300 --> 01:32:01,474
As far as I know, Aravindan reached
Mookambika when he was 5-6 years old.

1525
01:32:02,434 --> 01:32:06,211
Those pictures must be his memories
from his past before that.

1526
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:10,413
As your friends said,
if these places are in Udupi..

1527
01:32:10,567 --> 01:32:12,308
We'll definitely be
able to find them.

1528
01:32:12,434 --> 01:32:14,004
We will find them!

1529
01:32:36,334 --> 01:32:38,280
Awn
a

1530
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:40,370
Anyway, it's not Kerala.

1531
01:32:40,534 --> 01:32:42,605
There are no coconut trees
in any of those pictures.

1532
01:32:43,034 --> 01:32:45,344
Kids from Kerala .. The first
things they draw are a house,

1533
01:32:45,467 --> 01:32:47,970
a coconut tree in the courtyard,
and a hill behind, right?

1534
01:32:48,267 --> 01:32:50,372
All those pictures are
of Udupi drawings.

1535
01:32:50,500 --> 01:32:53,037
Aren't we going to the street
in Aravindan's drawing?

1536
01:32:53,734 --> 01:32:56,078
Let's go there and enquire.
- Okay.

1537
01:33:01,767 --> 01:33:03,440
I don't know.

1538
01:33:09,001 --> 01:33:10,105
Let's check there as well.

1539
01:33:10,667 --> 01:33:11,771
What if we find something?

1540
01:33:13,234 --> 01:33:17,239
Chetta, a centre called Surya?
- Go straight and turn right.

1541
01:33:25,434 --> 01:33:27,971
Surya Cultural Centre.
This is the place.

1542
01:33:28,100 --> 01:33:31,172
The emblem is the same.
- Check the pin code on your mobile.

1543
01:33:32,201 --> 01:33:33,680
It's 101..

1544
01:33:35,401 --> 01:33:37,210
Aadhi Udupi Post Office.

1545
01:33:37,334 --> 01:33:39,177
Aadhi Udupi Post Office.

1546
01:33:39,567 --> 01:33:42,673
With his name and age, let's enquire
at the municipal office as well.

1547
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:45,041
What if his birth was registered?

1548
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:48,170
Come fast.
It's 5 o'clock.

1549
01:33:51,567 --> 01:33:54,173
Sir, we need some
information urgently.

1550
01:33:54,300 --> 01:33:55,608
Please help us.
- Look.

1551
01:33:55,734 --> 01:33:57,407
It's 5 o'clock.
Office time over.

1552
01:33:57,534 --> 01:33:58,444
Come tomorrow

1553
01:33:58,567 --> 01:33:59,568
Sir, keep this.

1554
01:33:59,701 --> 01:34:00,771
Please, sir.

1555
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:04,242
Sir, in the period from '88 to '92,

1556
01:34:04,367 --> 01:34:06,745
if there was a birth registered
with the name 'Aravindan'.

1557
01:34:07,034 --> 01:34:08,513
It's very difficult
to find all that.

1558
01:34:08,634 --> 01:34:10,636
Can you give us
the details, sir?

1559
01:34:10,767 --> 01:34:13,008
I'll do whatever I can
for the money you gave.

1560
01:34:14,367 --> 01:34:15,675
Okay. Let me try.

1561
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:17,006
Wait a minute.

1562
01:34:24,234 --> 01:34:26,271
I've found this with
so much difficulty.

1563
01:35:05,434 --> 01:35:06,310
Aravindan,

1564
01:35:06,434 --> 01:35:08,436
Father: Balakrishna Adiga..
- And mother?

1565
01:35:08,567 --> 01:35:10,410
Mother: Geet ha La ks hm i.

1566
01:35:11,167 --> 01:35:13,408
Majestic press, Udupi.

1567
01:35:18,067 --> 01:35:20,445
Hey! They used to stay in a
portion of this building.

1568
01:35:20,567 --> 01:35:22,478
The house owner was
some Narayana Shetty.

1569
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:24,546
But he sold this and moved
to some other place.

1570
01:35:24,734 --> 01:35:26,077
That's all they know.

1571
01:35:26,200 --> 01:35:27,235
Here.

1572
01:35:27,634 --> 01:35:29,477
Isn't this the one?
- Our route is correct.

1573
01:35:30,134 --> 01:35:31,306
Pin code is also correct.

1574
01:35:37,267 --> 01:35:39,269
Let's catch hold of
some old postmen.

1575
01:35:39,401 --> 01:35:41,438
They might be able to give
us much more details.

1576
01:35:52,300 --> 01:35:54,541
Aunty, is this Postman
Appanna's house?

1577
01:35:54,667 --> 01:35:55,975
Yes. Come in.

1578
01:35:56,100 --> 01:35:57,204
This is the one.

1579
01:36:05,767 --> 01:36:07,212
Hello.
- See Varada,

1580
01:36:07,334 --> 01:36:08,608
you're a professional dancer.

1581
01:36:08,734 --> 01:36:10,611
You cannot do these kind of things.

1582
01:36:11,401 --> 01:36:13,677
Ma'am, I was..
- No. I hate excuses!

1583
01:36:15,367 --> 01:36:17,313
Balakrishna Adiga was a doctor.

1584
01:36:17,434 --> 01:36:20,005
Geetha Lakshmi was
a nursing student.

1585
01:36:20,501 --> 01:36:22,242
When their son was 5 years old,

1586
01:36:22,367 --> 01:36:23,778
the doctor left this town.

1587
01:36:24,067 --> 01:36:25,512
According to what he said,

1588
01:36:25,634 --> 01:36:27,477
his father Balakrishna
Adiga was a doctor.

1589
01:36:27,667 --> 01:36:29,647
His mother Geetha Lakshmi
was a nursing student.

1590
01:36:29,767 --> 01:36:31,713
When Aravindan turned 5,
his father left this town.

1591
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,673
And after 5-6 months,

1592
01:36:33,801 --> 01:36:36,042
Geetha Lakshmi and
son also left Udupi.

1593
01:36:36,667 --> 01:36:39,773
The outstanding rent and
money she had borrowed,

1594
01:36:40,067 --> 01:36:42,513
she sent it after a few days to
Narayana Shetty, the house owner,

1595
01:36:42,634 --> 01:36:43,635
as money order.

1596
01:37:12,034 --> 01:37:13,479
I'll tell you something!

1597
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:15,671
Don't interfere in any of
his matters, hereafter.

1598
01:37:19,001 --> 01:37:21,140
If you can find the
money order details,

1599
01:37:21,267 --> 01:37:23,076
you can get the 'From Address'
from that.

1600
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:25,305
He's saying that the 'From
Address' would be saved.

1601
01:37:25,534 --> 01:37:27,138
Will it still be there?
- It might be.

1602
01:37:27,267 --> 01:37:28,541
Sir, will it still be there?

1603
01:37:28,700 --> 01:37:29,678
Mad am,

1604
01:37:29,800 --> 01:37:33,077
unlike what you think, this is
not any random courier service.

1605
01:37:33,200 --> 01:37:34,611
Indian Postal Service!

1606
01:37:34,734 --> 01:37:37,078
Britishers started it, right?
Must be there!

1607
01:37:52,634 --> 01:37:57,606
Geetha Lakshmi, General Hospital,
Ananthanarayanapuram, Alappuzha.

1608
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:17,570
How m uch, Chet-ta?
- 20 Rupees.

1609
01:38:23,734 --> 01:38:24,769
<i>Chem. .</i>

1610
01:38:25,634 --> 01:38:28,979
Nursing Superintendent Geetha Lakshmi?
- Over there. C Block.

1611
01:38:58,500 --> 01:38:59,535
Who are you?

1612
01:38:59,800 --> 01:39:02,041
I am Aravindan's friend.
Varada.

1613
01:39:02,167 --> 01:39:03,373
Aravindan?

1614
01:39:03,567 --> 01:39:05,740
There's no patient in that
name in this block, dear.

1615
01:39:06,101 --> 01:39:07,273
He's not a patient.

1616
01:39:07,634 --> 01:39:08,669
Then?

1617
01:39:09,267 --> 01:39:11,144
He is Dr. Balakrishna Adiga's,

1618
01:39:11,267 --> 01:39:13,110
and Geetha Lakshmi's son.

1619
01:39:14,767 --> 01:39:15,768
Do you know him?

1620
01:39:16,067 --> 01:39:17,603
No. I don't know.

1621
01:39:18,001 --> 01:39:19,674
So I must be mistaken then.

1622
01:39:20,434 --> 01:39:21,469
Sorry.

1623
01:39:22,734 --> 01:39:27,308
If there's someone here who abandoned
her 5-6 year old son at Mookambika..

1624
01:39:27,734 --> 01:39:28,735
Here.

1625
01:39:29,034 --> 01:39:30,411
Give this number to her.

1626
01:39:39,634 --> 01:39:42,444
1996 October 20
Navratri

1627
01:40:02,034 --> 01:40:03,377
I fell in love with someone.

1628
01:40:04,101 --> 01:40:05,478
We lived together.

1629
01:40:07,367 --> 01:40:08,402
But I was betrayed.

1630
01:40:09,634 --> 01:40:12,080
I desperately needed to
find a solution for that.

1631
01:40:12,334 --> 01:40:14,439
Abandoning your own son
at the temple courtyard...

1632
01:40:14,567 --> 01:40:16,171
Was that the solution you found?

1633
01:40:18,234 --> 01:40:19,269
Very good!

1634
01:40:22,101 --> 01:40:25,207
I didn't leave him at
the temple courtyard.

1635
01:40:28,200 --> 01:40:30,703
Balakrishnan, who left saying
that he's going to his home-town,

1636
01:40:31,367 --> 01:40:32,641
never returned.

1637
01:40:34,001 --> 01:40:35,446
I went there to study"

1638
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,002
How could I go back
home with a child?

1639
01:40:39,234 --> 01:40:41,236
I had 3 younger sisters.

1640
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:45,644
I didn't have any other
option in front of me,

1641
01:40:45,767 --> 01:40:48,407
other than leaving him at
the Adiga Children's home.

1642
01:40:48,534 --> 01:40:49,569
Don't say that, Swamy.

1643
01:40:53,500 --> 01:40:54,535
I will come!

1644
01:40:57,101 --> 01:40:59,445
Rig ht now, I don't have
any other option, Swami.

1645
01:41:03,767 --> 01:41:05,075
Okay.

1646
01:41:14,034 --> 01:41:16,708
I confessed everything at home
and fell at their feet crying.

1647
01:41:18,367 --> 01:41:21,211
My father threatened that I'll
have to see their dead bodies,

1648
01:41:21,334 --> 01:41:23,041
if I brought my son home.

1649
01:41:27,801 --> 01:41:29,280
I have a husband now.

1650
01:41:29,401 --> 01:41:30,573
I have children as well.

1651
01:41:30,701 --> 01:41:32,612
I'm leading a peaceful
family life now.

1652
01:41:35,001 --> 01:41:36,173
No need to be scared, Madam.

1653
01:41:37,800 --> 01:41:39,336
However much he wishes for it,

1654
01:41:40,034 --> 01:41:41,570
Aravindan won't come
searching for you.

1655
01:41:42,600 --> 01:41:44,238
You can continue to
live peacefully.

1656
01:41:50,700 --> 01:41:51,735
Do you have...

1657
01:41:52,434 --> 01:41:54,641
...his photo with you?

1658
01:41:56,001 --> 01:41:57,036
Yes.

1659
01:41:58,434 --> 01:42:00,038
But you needn't see that.

1660
01:42:01,367 --> 01:42:08,979
" My dear..
My mother, as beautiful as a flower"

1661
01:42:09,634 --> 01:42:19,578
"Where did you go,
leaving me alone?"

1662
01:42:50,767 --> 01:42:51,745
Who's this?

1663
01:42:52,034 --> 01:42:53,035
I am Aravindan.

1664
01:42:55,100 --> 01:42:56,101
Who's speaking?

1665
01:43:00,600 --> 01:43:02,204
Hello Madam..
Tell me.

1666
01:43:15,734 --> 01:43:17,042
Geetha..

1667
01:43:25,434 --> 01:43:26,469
What happened?

1668
01:43:26,634 --> 01:43:28,477
Nothing"
I have a head-ache.

1669
01:43:29,068 --> 01:43:30,411
Then you rest for some time.

1670
01:43:59,734 --> 01:44:01,680
Are you a big fan of
Janaki Subramaniam?

1671
01:44:02,334 --> 01:44:03,312
Die-hard fan!

1672
01:44:03,434 --> 01:44:04,674
Without travelling to Kumbakonam,

1673
01:44:04,801 --> 01:44:08,715
you can't join Janaki
Subramaniam's dance academy.

1674
01:44:09,334 --> 01:44:10,608
Are you interested?

1675
01:44:28,334 --> 01:44:31,713
2017 September 29
Navratri

1676
01:44:40,567 --> 01:44:43,241
Did you see Kousu Chechi?
- Only one basket is here.

1677
01:44:45,267 --> 01:44:46,302
Kousu darling..

1678
01:44:47,234 --> 01:44:49,271
Girija dear..
-You know where all I looked for you!

1679
01:44:49,400 --> 01:44:51,471
Mm
a

1680
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:53,978
Today's Navratri, rig ht?
There's a huge rush in the temple.

1681
01:44:54,100 --> 01:44:55,977
Flowers are running out.
I came to get flowers.

1682
01:44:56,101 --> 01:44:57,239
Malli..
- You came back?

1683
01:44:57,367 --> 01:44:59,176
Yes. Came back!

1684
01:44:59,300 --> 01:45:01,746
What did you tell me when I left?
- To come for the festival.

1685
01:45:02,068 --> 01:45:03,638
No! You forgot!

1686
01:45:03,800 --> 01:45:05,279
I'll show you something.

1687
01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:07,606
See what this is..

1688
01:45:14,701 --> 01:45:16,271
Did you recognize them?

1689
01:45:18,267 --> 01:45:19,541
Aww! !

1690
01:45:19,667 --> 01:45:21,271
My grandchildren!

1691
01:45:22,434 --> 01:45:25,074
I have taken a video too.
See the video.

1692
01:45:26,301 --> 01:45:29,043
My grandchildren
are all grown up!

1693
01:45:31,167 --> 01:45:32,202
Tea!

1694
01:45:32,467 --> 01:45:35,141
If Prabhettan doesn't have
tea, he'll get a head-ache.

1695
01:45:35,267 --> 01:45:37,474
Malli, one cup of tea!
Fasfl

1696
01:45:39,501 --> 01:45:40,536
Tea!

1697
01:45:41,434 --> 01:45:42,469
Brother-in-law!

1698
01:45:43,001 --> 01:45:46,574
To shout 'Tea' in different
tunes and modulations,

1699
01:45:46,701 --> 01:45:48,476
this is not your own house!

1700
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:51,104
Tea!

1701
01:45:51,334 --> 01:45:52,677
Idiotic fellow!

1702
01:45:52,801 --> 01:45:53,711
Tea!

1703
01:45:54,001 --> 01:45:55,776
Who is this?
- This is 'Bull' Prabhakaran.

1704
01:45:56,067 --> 01:45:57,137
Hows the item?

1705
01:45:57,767 --> 01:45:59,337
Has Prabhakaran
brought the bull?

1706
01:45:59,467 --> 01:46:01,276
Bull is on its way; will
reach in the evening.

1707
01:46:01,400 --> 01:46:04,643
No need for a separate room, right?
- No. They will adjust in the same room.

1708
01:46:20,434 --> 01:46:21,469
Varada...

1709
01:46:40,034 --> 01:46:41,377
I have a husband now.

1710
01:46:41,567 --> 01:46:42,511
I have children as well.

1711
01:46:42,634 --> 01:46:44,409
I'm leading a peaceful
family life now.

1712
01:46:45,434 --> 01:46:47,141
Aravindan won't come in search of you.

1713
01:46:47,467 --> 01:46:49,071
You can continue to
live peacefully.

1714
01:46:50,267 --> 01:46:51,268
Good evening sir.

1715
01:46:51,400 --> 01:46:52,640
Welcome to Mookambika.

1716
01:46:55,634 --> 01:46:57,011
Shall we go?
-Ya.

1717
01:46:57,134 --> 01:46:58,477
No. I'll take it.
- Come, dear.

1718
01:47:46,400 --> 01:47:48,471
Mom could also have come
with us, right dear?

1719
01:51:05,200 --> 01:51:08,773
He studied till 12th grade in
a Government school nearby.

1720
01:51:09,500 --> 01:51:12,709
He completed all his studies here itself,
including post graduation.

1721
01:51:16,267 --> 01:51:17,644
Not just drawing..

1722
01:51:18,334 --> 01:51:19,574
He writes well..

1723
01:51:20,067 --> 01:51:21,341
He sings quite well too..

1724
01:51:22,601 --> 01:51:25,172
All the guests who come here,
become really fond of him!

1725
01:51:28,234 --> 01:51:29,269
Initially,

1726
01:51:29,500 --> 01:51:32,174
he used to shout 'Mom' in his
sleep and wake up, shocked.

1727
01:51:38,667 --> 01:51:42,740
Even after living on the shore of
Souparnika for all these years,

1728
01:51:43,568 --> 01:51:46,071
he hasn't seen the
Goddess Mookambika Devi.

1729
01:51:47,234 --> 01:51:49,578
He hasn't stepped
inside the temple.

1730
01:51:52,034 --> 01:51:53,035
That..

1731
01:51:55,034 --> 01:51:57,378
That's not because a
Communist raised him.

1732
01:52:37,400 --> 01:52:38,708
Mom!

1733
01:52:40,267 --> 01:52:48,015
" My dear..
My mother, as beautiful as a flower"

1734
01:52:48,567 --> 01:52:57,180
"Where did you go,
leaving me alone?"

1735
01:52:58,634 --> 01:53:07,315
" For you to follow me as my shadow“

1736
01:53:08,434 --> 01:53:15,977
" I kept waiting"

1737
01:53:16,634 --> 01:53:25,645
"Aren't you somewhere
far away in the sky?"

1738
01:53:25,767 --> 01:53:30,767
" Blinking your eyes, like a star?"

1739
01:53:46,767 --> 01:53:51,767
"Come! Come!"
"Those calls of yours"

1740
01:53:58,234 --> 01:54:06,051
"This breeze is spreading
them in my ears"

1741
01:54:06,234 --> 01:54:14,119
"Come! Come!"
"Those calls of yours"

1742
01:54:14,234 --> 01:54:21,618
"This breeze is spreading
them in my ears"

1743
01:54:21,734 --> 01:54:30,051
"You are my mother"

1744
01:54:30,234 --> 01:54:35,234
" O Janani (Mother),
hold me closer to you"

1745
01:54:41,067 --> 01:54:48,178
"You are my mother"

1746
01:54:48,800 --> 01:54:58,118
" I waited my entire life for you"

1747
01:54:59,534 --> 01:55:06,247
" My dear..
My mother, as beautiful as a flower"

1748
01:55:32,501 --> 01:55:33,536
Varada...

1749
01:55:35,034 --> 01:55:37,071
Something that all of us
have been waiting to see..

1750
01:55:37,534 --> 01:55:38,672
It's going to happen now.

1751
01:55:39,301 --> 01:55:40,336
Com e.

1752
01:55:49,367 --> 01:55:50,573
O Devi!

1753
01:55:50,700 --> 01:55:52,179
Hey! Take care of the shop.

1754
01:56:03,801 --> 01:56:11,344
"0 Devi, the merciful"

1755
01:56:29,234 --> 01:56:37,380
" There's joy all around..
There's joy in everything..."

1756
01:56:37,534 --> 01:56:46,511
" There's joy all around..
There's joy in everything..."

1757
01:57:02,734 --> 01:57:07,734
"You were flowing within my soul,
as the river Souparnika until today"

1758
01:57:25,267 --> 01:57:35,211
"You flowed like the river Souparnika"

1759
01:57:35,634 --> 01:57:43,348
" Here I am, today"

1760
01:57:43,734 --> 01:57:51,118
"Before you,
for the first time"

1761
01:57:51,667 --> 01:57:59,279
"Before you,
for the first time"

1762
01:58:12,268 --> 01:58:17,268
"You are my mother"

1763
01:58:23,534 --> 01:58:28,534
" O Janani (Mother),
hold me closer to you"

1764
01:58:34,367 --> 01:58:42,684
"You are my mother"

1765
01:58:44,134 --> 01:58:47,134
" I waited my entire life for you"
