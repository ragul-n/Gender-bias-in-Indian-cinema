1
00:01:47,332 --> 00:01:49,994
Sir... you won the case.
Congratulations!

2
00:01:53,639 --> 00:01:56,199
Sir... please, sir... sir... can you please
tell us how you feel on your win.

3
00:01:56,275 --> 00:01:57,173
Sir...

4
00:01:59,311 --> 00:02:00,243
Take the day off... l'll drive.

5
00:02:53,232 --> 00:02:54,722
Baba, you won again.

6
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,062
Congratulations!

7
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:46,901
Saru... you're still here.

8
00:04:47,312 --> 00:04:50,179
Hurry up, dear...
they will be here any minute.

9
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:51,875
Wait.

10
00:04:52,317 --> 00:04:55,115
Mom...
- Go. Go.

11
00:05:03,195 --> 00:05:04,992
The paper has come?

12
00:05:07,866 --> 00:05:10,300
The boy's family are coming from US.

13
00:05:10,869 --> 00:05:13,235
What if they don't like home food?

14
00:05:14,006 --> 00:05:15,530
So?

15
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:18,907
So... should we order some diet coke?

16
00:05:20,312 --> 00:05:23,873
You can bring instant food
in this house when I am dead!

17
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:26,676
Okay... leave it... l'm sorry.

18
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:30,251
serve the house-guests
on fresh banana leaves.

19
00:05:30,322 --> 00:05:31,721
Like we do at home.

20
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,587
They will appreciate it.

21
00:05:34,693 --> 00:05:36,854
They will respect Saru's family...

22
00:05:36,929 --> 00:05:40,194
...her culture and the
value system she belongs to.

23
00:05:49,107 --> 00:05:50,096
Hello.

24
00:05:50,175 --> 00:05:53,144
Yes, yes...
this is Jayram only speaking.

25
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:55,204
Yes, go on.

26
00:05:55,714 --> 00:05:56,612
Yes.

27
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,715
I see.

28
00:06:02,187 --> 00:06:03,711
I see.

29
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:07,981
I see...

30
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:15,656
They've cancelled the visit.

31
00:06:19,271 --> 00:06:20,863
Cancelled?

32
00:06:21,239 --> 00:06:22,706
But why?

33
00:06:22,874 --> 00:06:25,900
His mother made a list of 1 0 girls...

34
00:06:26,545 --> 00:06:28,740
...since the boy was in the US.

35
00:06:29,915 --> 00:06:31,849
He liked the first one he met.

36
00:06:32,818 --> 00:06:35,582
So why hurt our
daughter by coming here.

37
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:38,246
That's what they said.

38
00:06:40,058 --> 00:06:42,185
Pack Saru's and my lunch.

39
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:45,195
I'll drop her at the library
and head to the office.

40
00:06:45,263 --> 00:06:46,662
But... office?

41
00:06:46,732 --> 00:06:47,960
Didn't you take a leave today?

42
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:50,194
There's no occasion
to take a leave anymore.

43
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:55,806
If the world's on one side,
he'll be on the other side.

44
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:57,307
He never listens to me for...
- Mom!

45
00:06:57,576 --> 00:06:58,941
The boy didn't turn up...
what does that mean?

46
00:06:59,011 --> 00:07:02,003
Speak softly...
your father will overhear.

47
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,708
Does this mean my marriage
to Sanjay's been postponed again.

48
00:07:04,783 --> 00:07:06,978
Look, Kaveri.
I've told you a thousand times.

49
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:08,212
Saru is elder to you.

50
00:07:08,286 --> 00:07:09,719
She will get married first.

51
00:07:09,788 --> 00:07:11,517
You cannot get married until then.

52
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:13,922
Don't argue with me
on this again and again.

53
00:07:13,992 --> 00:07:16,119
Why don't you search
For a boy yourself?

54
00:07:16,194 --> 00:07:18,253
Is it only our responsibility?

55
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:21,158
There's a difference between searching
for someone and finding someone.

56
00:07:21,533 --> 00:07:23,694
It's not that I don't have crushes.

57
00:07:23,769 --> 00:07:27,170
But if the person doesn't reciprocate,
then what can I do about it?

58
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:28,570
I'll have to depend on my family...

59
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,040
...to find some suitable
boy and settle me down.

60
00:07:41,219 --> 00:07:42,243
Lift!

61
00:07:43,555 --> 00:07:44,749
Lift!

62
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:46,782
This lift... too...

63
00:07:46,858 --> 00:07:48,758
Waste of time I tell you.

64
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:50,254
Come, Saru.

65
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:59,863
What's going on here...
keeping the lift engaged?

66
00:08:01,673 --> 00:08:03,698
What's this vulgarity in the society?

67
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:05,868
Others have to get to work.

68
00:08:11,716 --> 00:08:12,648
Come, Saru

69
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,833
We'll need signatures on the deposit
cheque. - What are you doing here?

70
00:08:31,903 --> 00:08:32,597
Mr. Jayram.

71
00:08:32,671 --> 00:08:35,071
I was looking for you in the society,
Mr. Secretary.

72
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,005
Sir, we were booking
the hall for the AGM.

73
00:08:37,075 --> 00:08:38,542
It's alright.

74
00:08:38,743 --> 00:08:41,837
But I tell you what is this
nonsense going on in the society?

75
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,607
This is too much, you see.

76
00:08:43,682 --> 00:08:45,809
I am a founder member of this society.

77
00:08:45,884 --> 00:08:47,681
Yet, that doesn't scare him.

78
00:08:47,752 --> 00:08:49,777
Shirtless... shameless scoundrel.

79
00:08:49,855 --> 00:08:51,846
Sir, you mean that 20/52?

80
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:54,886
He's a criminal. Yes!

81
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,121
He was jailed at the age of 1 3.

82
00:08:57,195 --> 00:08:58,594
For murder!

83
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,858
Why did you give NOC
to a criminal like him?

84
00:09:00,932 --> 00:09:01,830
We can't stop him.

85
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,834
Sir, it's like this.

86
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:06,493
The original owner, Ms. Lily...

87
00:09:06,571 --> 00:09:08,664
...she transferred her
flat in this boy's name.

88
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,071
Ms. Lily.
- Yes.

89
00:09:10,142 --> 00:09:11,837
Such a sensible lady.

90
00:09:12,244 --> 00:09:16,146
And she transferred her
home to a road-side rubbish.

91
00:09:16,214 --> 00:09:17,875
Sir, he's no road-side rubbish.

92
00:09:17,949 --> 00:09:19,610
I've heard that his
father is some big-shot.

93
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:22,152
If you object... he'll brag
about some law or the other.

94
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,154
He's got a good knowledge
about laws and bylaws.

95
00:09:24,222 --> 00:09:25,120
What can we do?

96
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,784
So you let that jail-bird
turned lawyer intimidate you?

97
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:29,827
And turn our society
into a dance bar.

98
00:09:29,895 --> 00:09:31,021
Sir, what did I do?

99
00:09:31,096 --> 00:09:33,860
How can a secretary stop the parade of
girls from coming and going?

100
00:09:33,932 --> 00:09:37,231
A Secretary's job is to maintain
discipline in the society.

101
00:09:37,302 --> 00:09:39,065
If you can't do it, better resign.

102
00:09:39,137 --> 00:09:40,695
We'll elect someone else.

103
00:09:40,772 --> 00:09:41,830
Come, Saru.

104
00:09:43,842 --> 00:09:46,640
What's my fault in all this?
- Taxi!

105
00:09:49,681 --> 00:09:51,774
Since when did you
start reading love poetry?

106
00:09:57,656 --> 00:09:59,214
Waste product.

107
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:02,917
Such books don't
increase your IQ level.

108
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:26,308
Saraswati Parthasaarthy.

109
00:10:31,156 --> 00:10:33,886
The research you gave
me on Market Trends...

110
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:35,756
Outstanding!

111
00:10:36,194 --> 00:10:37,957
My boss is floored.

112
00:10:38,797 --> 00:10:39,957
Saru...

113
00:10:44,135 --> 00:10:46,000
I need a favor from you.

114
00:10:46,071 --> 00:10:49,734
My office has organized
a Summer-funk party...

115
00:10:49,808 --> 00:10:52,003
...for under-privileged kids.

116
00:10:52,711 --> 00:10:55,908
But the guy who was supposed
to dress up as the bear... fell sick.

117
00:10:56,615 --> 00:10:59,311
So... can you dress
up as the dancing bear?

118
00:11:04,556 --> 00:11:06,114
Please don't say no.

119
00:11:06,858 --> 00:11:08,086
It's for charity.

120
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:11,226
It's my boss' wife's pet project.

121
00:11:11,596 --> 00:11:14,724
If you say yes...
you'll do me a big favor.

122
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:15,925
Please.

123
00:11:32,617 --> 00:11:44,154
"Don't ask... about the condition
of my heart... beloved."

124
00:11:45,363 --> 00:11:56,035
"It's immersed in the
intoxication of your love..."

125
00:11:57,075 --> 00:12:00,203
"...the ambiance."

126
00:12:00,612 --> 00:12:04,104
"Don't ask... about the condition
of my heart... beloved."

127
00:12:07,118 --> 00:12:08,847
How did weepy... Saru... become

128
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,615
...a bouncing bear today?

129
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:12,580
What did Abhimanyu
promise you this time?

130
00:12:12,657 --> 00:12:13,282
A kiss?

131
00:12:13,558 --> 00:12:14,252
A hug?

132
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:17,653
Or... just holding hands
Would've been enough for you.

133
00:12:17,729 --> 00:12:20,630
And the anonymous Valentine's
day card you sent for Abhimanyu...

134
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:22,997
...everyone really
liked it in the office.

135
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:46,987
"When the twilight falls."

136
00:12:47,359 --> 00:12:50,851
"...I think I think of you."

137
00:12:51,196 --> 00:12:54,359
"Brings a storm."

138
00:12:54,632 --> 00:12:58,659
"You're in my memories."

139
00:12:58,737 --> 00:13:06,041
"Every desire is incomplete."

140
00:13:06,111 --> 00:13:13,017
"My heart's lost in mischief."

141
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:16,884
"The caravan of dreams."

142
00:13:16,955 --> 00:13:20,584
"The series of conversations."

143
00:13:20,658 --> 00:13:25,095
"Follow me everywhere I go."

144
00:13:28,233 --> 00:13:39,235
"Whether day or night,
it's lost in a trance..."

145
00:13:40,145 --> 00:13:43,080
"The ambience."

146
00:13:43,815 --> 00:13:54,020
"Don't ask... about the condition
of my heart... beloved."

147
00:14:05,904 --> 00:14:07,667
Stop taking off your clothes, please!

148
00:14:07,739 --> 00:14:08,671
Oh

149
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,230
Sorry, sorry, sorry... sorry.

150
00:14:11,075 --> 00:14:12,133
I am very sorry!

151
00:14:12,877 --> 00:14:14,242
I am very sorry!

152
00:14:21,286 --> 00:14:23,186
I thought the bear is a guy.

153
00:14:41,873 --> 00:14:43,864
Why don't you take
off that Eskimo suit?

154
00:14:44,609 --> 00:14:46,304
Or else you will
melt in this heat.

155
00:15:24,582 --> 00:15:26,573
Hurry up, please.

156
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:49,301
Excuse me.

157
00:15:53,111 --> 00:15:54,703
Your... head!

158
00:15:55,947 --> 00:15:57,312
Thanks.

159
00:15:59,884 --> 00:16:02,876
Listen... can you recommend me a book?

160
00:16:04,022 --> 00:16:05,717
Book?

161
00:16:06,524 --> 00:16:07,786
Like what?

162
00:16:08,526 --> 00:16:12,155
Like if someone's been released
from jail after 8 years...

163
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:13,993
...so what should he read?

164
00:16:14,065 --> 00:16:15,965
Something... like that.

165
00:16:40,725 --> 00:16:48,154
"I wonder how...
you came so close to me..."

166
00:16:48,232 --> 00:16:54,831
"Everyone else feels
alienated from me."

167
00:16:55,807 --> 00:17:02,679
"With every breath
I take... I feel alive."

168
00:17:03,214 --> 00:17:10,143
"Please don't go away now."

169
00:17:10,221 --> 00:17:13,918
"The ambiance is standing still."

170
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:17,655
"The moments feel blissful."

171
00:17:17,729 --> 00:17:22,530
"I am all alone here."

172
00:17:26,971 --> 00:17:28,962
Never want to see you again.

173
00:17:31,843 --> 00:17:33,037
Buzz off.

174
00:17:41,085 --> 00:17:42,211
Damn you!

175
00:17:44,155 --> 00:17:45,952
I hope you die.

176
00:17:46,991 --> 00:17:49,152
Go to hell. Go to hell.

177
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,925
I'm never going to see him again.

178
00:17:50,995 --> 00:17:52,587
Never! Never! Never!

179
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:04,004
Saru, Sanjay... has seen
a suitable boy for you.

180
00:18:04,275 --> 00:18:05,867
He's based in Denmark.

181
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:08,135
Works for Mars Electronics.

182
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:10,203
He'll come see you tomorrow.

183
00:18:15,086 --> 00:18:17,145
But mom and you are leaving
for Tirupati tomorrow.

184
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:20,987
Sanjay requested me personally...
so I've given him my permission.

185
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:23,056
He's a nice guy.

186
00:18:23,628 --> 00:18:25,095
IIT... llM.

187
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,593
And Vaideki Brahmins.

188
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:29,790
Even the horoscopes
are a perfect match.

189
00:18:29,867 --> 00:18:33,200
But without you two...
my heart doesn't agree.

190
00:18:34,272 --> 00:18:38,902
If things go your way, its good.
If not, it's even better.

191
00:18:39,911 --> 00:18:42,004
Because it's the will of God.

192
00:18:51,022 --> 00:18:52,046
Hi.

193
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:53,581
Good.

194
00:18:54,859 --> 00:18:55,621
Hi.
- Hi.

195
00:18:55,693 --> 00:18:57,126
Hello.

196
00:18:58,696 --> 00:19:00,163
Tea/coffee?
- No, thanks.

197
00:19:00,231 --> 00:19:02,256
I'll go get Saru.
- Okay.

198
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:08,697
Come on... quickly.

199
00:19:08,973 --> 00:19:10,736
What's this?

200
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:12,237
Come on.

201
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:14,775
Here.

202
00:19:14,846 --> 00:19:17,212
She's my sister Saru.
- Hi.

203
00:19:20,718 --> 00:19:22,845
So nice to have you.

204
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:45,072
It was a pleasure
meeting you.

205
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:47,202
Same here.
- Thanks. - Take care.

206
00:19:47,278 --> 00:19:48,973
Thanks.
- And see you later.

207
00:19:55,887 --> 00:19:57,081
See you tomorrow.

208
00:20:00,892 --> 00:20:02,154
Perfect match for you.

209
00:20:02,226 --> 00:20:04,660
Great guy! I really like him!

210
00:20:05,129 --> 00:20:07,825
Hey... he left his phone here.

211
00:20:08,132 --> 00:20:11,158
Come on, Saru. You've a readymade
excuse to meet him again.

212
00:20:11,235 --> 00:20:12,065
Take it.

213
00:20:12,136 --> 00:20:13,228
Come on.

214
00:20:13,571 --> 00:20:15,664
He'll really like it if you
return him his phone. - No, Kaveri.

215
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,332
Come on, go.
- No, no.

216
00:20:20,278 --> 00:20:22,746
Kaveri's calling.
What do I tell her?

217
00:20:24,081 --> 00:20:25,241
What do I tell her what?

218
00:20:26,317 --> 00:20:28,080
You hitched a beauty like Kaveri...

219
00:20:28,186 --> 00:20:30,950
...and sticking me up
with a frump aunt like Saraswati.

220
00:20:31,289 --> 00:20:33,257
Are you my friend or my enemy?

221
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:36,656
S*** man! I had high hopes with you.

222
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:39,292
And you're the 1 0th
guy who's rejecting Saru.

223
00:20:40,164 --> 00:20:41,654
There were 9 before me?

224
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:43,925
When were you going to tell me this?

225
00:20:44,001 --> 00:20:45,696
After getting hooked-booked.

226
00:20:46,304 --> 00:20:49,068
Look... if I want to marry Kaveri...

227
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:51,665
...I must first find someone
for that encyclopaedia.

228
00:20:51,742 --> 00:20:54,074
Old man Parthasaarthy insists on it.

229
00:20:54,145 --> 00:20:55,942
I am fed up.

230
00:20:56,814 --> 00:20:58,338
I can't help you in this.

231
00:20:58,616 --> 00:21:01,676
Saraswati is your problem, not mine.

232
00:21:05,823 --> 00:21:07,688
Kaveri, you told Sanjay about...

233
00:21:07,758 --> 00:21:09,919
...the number of
boys that rejected me.

234
00:21:09,994 --> 00:21:11,018
How could you?

235
00:21:11,095 --> 00:21:14,758
Even Arun said no, he doesn't
want a frumpy aunt like you.

236
00:21:15,132 --> 00:21:15,996
I know.

237
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:18,968
And you know what?
Sanjay's given me an ultimatum.

238
00:21:19,036 --> 00:21:21,300
He won't wait until you get married.

239
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:23,335
He says either we
get married next month...

240
00:21:23,608 --> 00:21:25,200
...and I move to the US with him.

241
00:21:25,276 --> 00:21:27,210
Or... forget him.

242
00:21:27,712 --> 00:21:28,804
I am so sorry.

243
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:30,278
Don't say sorry.

244
00:21:30,715 --> 00:21:32,945
Smarten up, find a man.

245
00:21:34,185 --> 00:21:35,652
Oh, God!

246
00:21:35,953 --> 00:21:38,751
Who am I asking to smarten up?

247
00:21:38,823 --> 00:21:42,919
You will never change.
You're a fossil.

248
00:21:43,227 --> 00:21:46,128
And I will lose Sanjay
all because of you.

249
00:21:46,197 --> 00:21:48,961
I love Sanjay.
- So we'll sort it out.

250
00:21:49,033 --> 00:21:53,231
How can I live without him?
- Kaveri.

251
00:21:53,304 --> 00:21:55,169
I'll elope with him,
there's no other way.

252
00:21:55,239 --> 00:21:56,672
No, Kaveri.

253
00:21:56,741 --> 00:21:59,938
Kaveri, think about dad...
he's already suffered a heart attack.

254
00:22:00,011 --> 00:22:02,639
If you run away...
he'll be humiliated.

255
00:22:02,713 --> 00:22:04,772
Dad will be heart-broken, Kaveri.

256
00:22:05,283 --> 00:22:06,648
And what about my heart.

257
00:22:06,717 --> 00:22:09,584
Does anyone care if that shatters?
- Of course we do.

258
00:22:09,654 --> 00:22:10,678
I do.

259
00:22:10,755 --> 00:22:13,553
Kaveri, I promise you...

260
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:15,854
...l'll get you married
to Sanjay before he leaves.

261
00:22:15,927 --> 00:22:16,859
Promise.

262
00:22:16,928 --> 00:22:18,987
But stop making these absurd plans.

263
00:22:19,063 --> 00:22:20,690
You promise. Promise?

264
00:22:21,065 --> 00:22:23,226
Promise!

265
00:22:50,061 --> 00:22:53,827
Hello. I want an appointment of
Ms. Ruby Malhotra.

266
00:22:54,265 --> 00:22:55,323
Three...

267
00:22:56,334 --> 00:22:58,700
A three month waiting list?

268
00:22:59,236 --> 00:23:01,727
Sir, please can you do something?

269
00:23:03,741 --> 00:23:05,072
Recommendation?

270
00:23:06,277 --> 00:23:07,244
Sir...

271
00:23:08,112 --> 00:23:10,307
Okay... thank you.

272
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:15,842
Recommendation.

273
00:23:39,844 --> 00:23:40,902
Sanjay, don't hang up on me. Please.

274
00:23:40,978 --> 00:23:41,808
Please.

275
00:23:41,912 --> 00:23:43,777
Oh no.

276
00:23:51,622 --> 00:23:53,283
Go away!

277
00:23:55,292 --> 00:23:56,759
Hello.

278
00:23:57,328 --> 00:23:58,659
Sanjay.

279
00:23:59,263 --> 00:24:02,027
Sanjay, listen to me please.

280
00:24:55,753 --> 00:24:57,015
Can I come in?

281
00:25:01,592 --> 00:25:02,718
Sorry, I...

282
00:25:04,695 --> 00:25:07,095
I'll finish my exercise.

283
00:25:10,234 --> 00:25:12,998
Sorry for disturbing you at this hour.

284
00:25:20,544 --> 00:25:24,241
I didn't expect that anyone
would be exercising at this hour.

285
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:32,081
Even I didn't expect...
that you'll come see me at this hour.

286
00:25:34,825 --> 00:25:37,555
I had to come at this hour,
so that no one sees me.

287
00:25:38,896 --> 00:25:40,830
If dad finds out...

288
00:25:48,873 --> 00:25:50,841
And you haven't been to
the library for a long time...

289
00:25:50,908 --> 00:25:52,773
...so I had to come here.

290
00:25:55,713 --> 00:25:57,977
Actually... I needed your help.

291
00:25:58,315 --> 00:26:00,180
It's an emergency.

292
00:26:06,223 --> 00:26:08,248
I came here to ask...

293
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,618
Please tell your Monday-girlfriend...

294
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:12,855
...to do a makeover for me.

295
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:15,023
My situation is really desperate.

296
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,627
Monday-Girlfriend?

297
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:21,830
She's the best makeover
specialist in the country.

298
00:26:21,906 --> 00:26:23,874
For Brides-to-be
and Brides-in-waiting.

299
00:26:24,308 --> 00:26:26,742
She can completely change
the life of girls like me.

300
00:26:27,244 --> 00:26:28,836
I tried to get an appointment...

301
00:26:28,913 --> 00:26:30,881
...but there's a three
month waiting list.

302
00:26:30,948 --> 00:26:32,973
And I don't have that long.

303
00:26:33,851 --> 00:26:35,250
I know that you two had a quarrel...

304
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:37,844
...but if you
could please patch up...

305
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:49,563
Please put in a recommendation for me.

306
00:26:52,403 --> 00:26:53,927
Inder my love...

307
00:26:55,206 --> 00:26:58,107
I am so... so... so... so sorry.

308
00:26:58,309 --> 00:27:00,777
We shouldn't have broken up.
I am sorry.

309
00:27:00,844 --> 00:27:02,744
I said really stupid
things over the phone.

310
00:27:02,813 --> 00:27:04,678
Let us get back.

311
00:27:28,038 --> 00:27:31,007
Seems like you did a lot of exercise.

312
00:27:32,309 --> 00:27:33,936
Not in the gym,

313
00:27:35,579 --> 00:27:36,978
but on the bed.

314
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:41,078
Calm down, Ruby.

315
00:27:41,151 --> 00:27:42,812
Saru is my neighbor.

316
00:27:42,886 --> 00:27:44,046
She came to see me because...

317
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:45,179
...she wanted an appointment with you.

318
00:27:45,256 --> 00:27:46,746
At 4am.

319
00:27:47,324 --> 00:27:49,792
You were giving her
an appointment at 4am.

320
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:52,226
Do you think I don't understand?

321
00:27:52,296 --> 00:27:55,288
Do I look like an idiot to you?

322
00:27:55,599 --> 00:27:58,033
She's here to hit on you.

323
00:27:58,235 --> 00:28:00,863
I meet with such frumps every day.

324
00:28:00,938 --> 00:28:04,806
The longer their kurta,
the longer their sex-drive.

325
00:28:05,109 --> 00:28:06,201
And you...

326
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:09,235
You can't say no, isn't it?

327
00:28:10,881 --> 00:28:12,143
Stay, Saru.

328
00:28:19,523 --> 00:28:22,151
Ruby, say sorry.
- Are you crazy?

329
00:28:22,226 --> 00:28:24,694
You think I'll
apologies to this frump.

330
00:28:26,697 --> 00:28:28,062
She came to see you.

331
00:28:28,132 --> 00:28:30,657
Say sorry right now.
- What if I don't?

332
00:28:30,734 --> 00:28:32,998
Then you can go back
to your Cuffe Parade.

333
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:37,700
You're rejecting me...
for this museum piece.

334
00:28:37,775 --> 00:28:38,673
Me?

335
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:43,007
Just get lost.

336
00:28:47,651 --> 00:28:49,881
You know what...

337
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:52,848
Just go to... hell!

338
00:29:02,166 --> 00:29:04,862
Go and say sorry.
- I don't say sorry.

339
00:29:16,847 --> 00:29:18,041
Listen...

340
00:29:18,115 --> 00:29:19,514
Go home.

341
00:29:20,851 --> 00:29:24,753
This is all my fault, so I feel
responsible... - Go home.

342
00:29:24,822 --> 00:29:26,881
You should go to a hospital.

343
00:29:26,957 --> 00:29:28,891
You are bleeding.

344
00:29:28,959 --> 00:29:30,654
I'll come along too.

345
00:29:30,728 --> 00:29:31,956
Sion Circle.

346
00:29:35,299 --> 00:29:38,268
Hello, Mr. Secretary.

347
00:29:39,269 --> 00:29:41,829
There's a problem in the society, sir.

348
00:29:50,748 --> 00:29:52,841
The wound is really deep.

349
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:55,141
We should go to a hospital.

350
00:29:55,719 --> 00:29:56,981
Do you have Hajmola?

351
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:59,685
By the way, the girl is right.

352
00:30:00,023 --> 00:30:01,923
You're covered in blood...
but not in a hospital.

353
00:30:01,992 --> 00:30:02,754
Why?

354
00:30:02,826 --> 00:30:04,225
I mean why?

355
00:30:04,895 --> 00:30:08,331
I don't need it sir, my wounds
heal really soon.

356
00:30:15,172 --> 00:30:16,298
How?

357
00:30:17,975 --> 00:30:19,840
Used to getting wounds?

358
00:30:20,878 --> 00:30:23,813
As far as I know, only two
kinds of people are used to it.

359
00:30:23,914 --> 00:30:25,074
Thieves and police.

360
00:30:25,816 --> 00:30:26,942
Which one are you?

361
00:30:27,217 --> 00:30:28,684
Let's go.

362
00:30:30,287 --> 00:30:30,719
Let's go.

363
00:30:30,788 --> 00:30:32,016
Saru, go home.

364
00:30:32,756 --> 00:30:33,882
No, no, hold on.

365
00:30:34,358 --> 00:30:36,622
Saru you go home means what?
To hell with the inspector.

366
00:30:36,693 --> 00:30:38,217
What do you think I'm doing here?

367
00:30:38,295 --> 00:30:39,819
I am talking to you.

368
00:30:42,599 --> 00:30:44,089
Bharti.
- Yes, sir.

369
00:30:44,168 --> 00:30:46,136
Seems like an old offender...
surely must have a record.

370
00:30:46,203 --> 00:30:47,670
Get these two in the jeep.

371
00:30:47,738 --> 00:30:49,000
Come on.
- Sir, please.

372
00:30:49,072 --> 00:30:50,164
Please listen to me.

373
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,298
Sir, there's nothing illegal here.

374
00:30:51,375 --> 00:30:52,774
His girlfriend broke
a bottle...

375
00:30:52,843 --> 00:30:54,140
...and the glass pieces
got stuck in his back.

376
00:30:54,211 --> 00:30:57,738
It's just a small misunderstanding,
sir, nothing else.

377
00:30:58,115 --> 00:30:59,207
I see...

378
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:02,148
Then call that girlfriend
to the police station as well.

379
00:31:04,588 --> 00:31:05,646
Where to?

380
00:31:05,722 --> 00:31:08,088
I told you go home.
Please listen to me.

381
00:31:08,158 --> 00:31:09,090
Go home. Please.
- No.

382
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:11,684
This is all my fault,
I feel responsible.

383
00:31:11,762 --> 00:31:12,956
I've to fix this.
- Saru, don't...

384
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:15,999
Sir... sir... sir...

385
00:31:16,066 --> 00:31:18,933
If he calls his girlfriend
to the station, things will get worse.

386
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:21,971
They won't get a second chance
to say sorry and I love you.

387
00:31:22,039 --> 00:31:23,734
What did you say?

388
00:31:24,308 --> 00:31:26,173
What did you just say?

389
00:31:26,643 --> 00:31:30,704
They won't get a second chance
to say sorry and I love you.

390
00:31:31,782 --> 00:31:32,214
Sorry.

391
00:31:32,282 --> 00:31:35,217
Sir, please... please...

392
00:31:41,124 --> 00:31:42,785
Bharti.
- Yes, sir.

393
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:45,961
I know his wounds heal fast...

394
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:48,156
...but take him to the hospital,
dress up his wounds...

395
00:31:49,333 --> 00:31:51,301
...and take him home.
- Okay, sir.

396
00:31:51,935 --> 00:31:53,129
Okay?

397
00:31:55,839 --> 00:31:57,272
Can we go, sir?

398
00:32:00,277 --> 00:32:00,971
Sion hospital.

399
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:03,274
'Hari, keep this
gun and sticks aside.'

400
00:32:03,814 --> 00:32:06,146
'Only two words are
enough to run this world.'

401
00:32:06,817 --> 00:32:08,682
Sorry... I love you.

402
00:32:09,653 --> 00:32:10,620
See... dear...

403
00:32:10,787 --> 00:32:12,687
You left me.

404
00:32:12,756 --> 00:32:14,314
But some day this "Sorry-l Love you"...

405
00:32:14,591 --> 00:32:16,616
...will cost me my job.

406
00:32:16,894 --> 00:32:18,828
Let's go.

407
00:32:32,643 --> 00:32:33,610
Hello.

408
00:32:34,711 --> 00:32:38,613
Mr. Secretary...
this looks like a police case, sir.

409
00:32:39,016 --> 00:32:43,783
That boy from 20/52...
and Parthasaarthy sir's daughter.

410
00:32:43,854 --> 00:32:46,152
They're both back in bandages.

411
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:49,055
See you, Inder.

412
00:32:55,699 --> 00:33:03,003
Inder, your medicines are with me.

413
00:33:03,774 --> 00:33:05,742
Remember... if you feel nauseous,
take the red pill...

414
00:33:05,809 --> 00:33:08,175
...and if you feel pain,
take this capsule.

415
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,908
Where do I keep it?

416
00:33:18,255 --> 00:33:21,691
The doctor's asked you to sleep
on your stomach... not your back.

417
00:33:22,759 --> 00:33:24,659
It will put pressure on the stitches.

418
00:33:25,662 --> 00:33:26,686
In...

419
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,092
Inder!

420
00:33:31,835 --> 00:33:32,824
Inder!

421
00:33:37,074 --> 00:33:38,336
Inder!

422
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:02,062
Driver... untie this rope.

423
00:34:02,132 --> 00:34:04,566
Mr. Jayram, sir. One moment Please.

424
00:34:04,635 --> 00:34:05,761
Hello.

425
00:34:06,203 --> 00:34:07,693
What's the matter?
What's the fare?

426
00:34:07,771 --> 00:34:09,068
Having a meeting in
the society without me?

427
00:34:09,139 --> 00:34:10,936
Look at what's going
on in the society.

428
00:34:11,008 --> 00:34:12,202
What happened?
- Tell him. What Saraswati was doing?

429
00:34:12,275 --> 00:34:18,214
Late last night, your daughter...
and that guy from 20/52...

430
00:34:18,815 --> 00:34:21,181
What about 20/52?

431
00:34:21,251 --> 00:34:23,879
She was going to
and fro the whole time?

432
00:34:23,954 --> 00:34:27,082
Saraswati! Are you drunk?
- No, sir.

433
00:34:27,157 --> 00:34:30,058
Have you lost your mind, scoundrel?
Nonsense!

434
00:34:30,127 --> 00:34:31,560
I'll get you fired.

435
00:34:31,628 --> 00:34:33,027
You can check for yourself, sir.

436
00:34:33,096 --> 00:34:34,893
They're still upstairs ever since
that policemen brought them back.

437
00:34:34,965 --> 00:34:38,162
Police? Saraswati...
what nonsense is he...

438
00:34:38,235 --> 00:34:41,033
Sir, I say we go upstairs
and check ourselves.

439
00:34:41,104 --> 00:34:42,162
All the conjectures
will be laid to rest.

440
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,002
Arundhati, go home!

441
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:45,666
Come, sir.

442
00:34:45,742 --> 00:34:47,334
Come on.
- Come.

443
00:34:51,815 --> 00:34:52,577
Come, sir.

444
00:34:52,649 --> 00:34:54,207
I'm telling you I'm not lying

445
00:34:54,284 --> 00:34:56,616
Let's check it out.

446
00:35:05,529 --> 00:35:06,052
Saru...

447
00:35:06,129 --> 00:35:07,994
The watchman was right.

448
00:35:15,706 --> 00:35:17,640
Dad, you were supposed
to return tomorrow.

449
00:35:34,157 --> 00:35:35,624
This...

450
00:35:38,829 --> 00:35:39,796
Sir...

451
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,803
You misunderstand.

452
00:35:52,876 --> 00:35:55,310
I went to the hospital, so...
- Shut up, boy.

453
00:35:55,846 --> 00:35:57,336
You've turned the entire
society into a brothel.

454
00:35:57,614 --> 00:35:58,740
And this time you crossed all limits.

455
00:35:58,815 --> 00:36:00,282
First you hit own our girls...

456
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:02,011
...and now you're daring us too.

457
00:36:02,085 --> 00:36:04,212
Aren't you ashamed?
- I didn't...

458
00:36:04,921 --> 00:36:06,718
I didn't hit on anyone.

459
00:36:07,724 --> 00:36:09,885
Saru...
- What Saru?

460
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,086
Her name is Saraswati.

461
00:36:11,161 --> 00:36:13,026
Saraswati Parthsaarthy.

462
00:36:13,096 --> 00:36:15,030
And a girl like
Saraswati Parthsaarthy...

463
00:36:15,098 --> 00:36:18,192
...broke all norms of
her family for a boy like you.

464
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:21,160
Can you give us descent
people a reason for it?

465
00:36:21,238 --> 00:36:22,205
Tell me.

466
00:36:26,843 --> 00:36:28,777
What will they say, Mr. Chairman?

467
00:36:28,845 --> 00:36:30,107
I'll tell you.

468
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:32,045
I was on night duty.

469
00:36:32,716 --> 00:36:36,117
He's with sister since 4am.
I swear.

470
00:36:36,186 --> 00:36:37,744
I never lie.

471
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:40,688
And we've severe objections
on such behaviour.

472
00:36:42,292 --> 00:36:45,090
Dad... dad, please let's go home.

473
00:36:45,162 --> 00:36:46,720
I'll tell you everything.

474
00:36:46,797 --> 00:36:49,322
Please, dad. Let's go home.
Please. Please.

475
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:50,566
Really!

476
00:36:51,701 --> 00:36:53,601
Go.
- Mr. Jayram.

477
00:36:53,904 --> 00:36:55,269
Some mistakes are unpardonable...

478
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:57,568
...these sayings look
best only in textbooks.

479
00:36:57,641 --> 00:36:59,199
And she's still your daughter.

480
00:36:59,276 --> 00:37:01,073
Such mistakes happen at this age.

481
00:37:01,144 --> 00:37:03,612
I suggest that you
compromise a little...

482
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,511
...and take your daughter home.

483
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:11,118
Sorry, please.

484
00:37:12,055 --> 00:37:14,523
Please. Dad. Please.

485
00:37:22,232 --> 00:37:24,291
Arundhati.
- Dad.

486
00:37:25,735 --> 00:37:28,226
Call the priests that
perform the last rites.

487
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:30,570
We need to perform the last rites.

488
00:37:32,242 --> 00:37:33,573
Whose?

489
00:37:34,678 --> 00:37:36,236
Your daughter's dead.

490
00:37:37,247 --> 00:37:39,738
Saru. Her final rites.

491
00:37:41,618 --> 00:37:44,917
Now there's no hindrance to
our younger daughter's marriage.

492
00:37:46,156 --> 00:37:48,556
Give this good news to Kaveri.

493
00:37:56,633 --> 00:37:59,101
Some mistakes cannot be pardoned.

494
00:37:59,769 --> 00:38:01,134
Did you all hear?

495
00:38:01,705 --> 00:38:03,229
My daughter's dead today.

496
00:38:04,641 --> 00:38:07,769
Do come home for the oblations.

497
00:38:08,645 --> 00:38:09,873
You too.

498
00:38:14,985 --> 00:38:15,974
Let's go.

499
00:38:16,052 --> 00:38:16,711
Come on.

500
00:38:31,034 --> 00:38:32,558
Sorry.

501
00:38:35,038 --> 00:38:36,699
What are you saying sorry for?

502
00:38:39,843 --> 00:38:40,901
Just sorry.

503
00:38:56,092 --> 00:38:57,957
Where are you going?
- Office.

504
00:38:58,228 --> 00:38:59,126
Why?

505
00:39:05,268 --> 00:39:08,032
Because now there's
no occasion to take a leave.

506
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,946
Hello.
- Hello, Saru.

507
00:39:28,091 --> 00:39:30,116
What were you doing
in that boy's home?

508
00:39:38,601 --> 00:39:42,002
I promised Kaveri that
I will get her married.

509
00:39:42,305 --> 00:39:46,799
Whatever's happened... at least
dad has agreed to her marriage,

510
00:39:49,145 --> 00:39:51,545
What are you doing, dear?

511
00:39:51,748 --> 00:39:58,551
What are you thinking? - Please mom,
let Kaveri get married first.

512
00:39:58,621 --> 00:40:00,885
I will call you every day.

513
00:40:02,058 --> 00:40:04,049
Will you tell dad about it.

514
00:40:04,728 --> 00:40:08,789
You know him, I cannot tell him.

515
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:12,092
Then please don't call me.

516
00:40:13,636 --> 00:40:16,002
If he finds out, he'll be shattered.

517
00:40:16,172 --> 00:40:17,298
Oh, God!

518
00:40:17,574 --> 00:40:21,032
Between the father-daughter
principles, of the getting wrenched.

519
00:40:27,317 --> 00:40:28,978
Bye, mom.

520
00:41:01,851 --> 00:41:03,011
Hello.

521
00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:05,077
Yes, sir. I called.

522
00:41:05,855 --> 00:41:08,551
Sir, I must get the house today.

523
00:41:08,958 --> 00:41:10,220
Sir, please.

524
00:41:26,676 --> 00:41:31,306
See... I can't find a place to stay.

525
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:39,887
And you need to give me
the report as soon as possible.

526
00:41:39,956 --> 00:41:42,015
Here.
- Hold on. Saru.

527
00:41:42,692 --> 00:41:44,319
We're heading towards Five Gardens.

528
00:41:44,594 --> 00:41:46,289
We'll drop you on the way.

529
00:41:51,901 --> 00:41:52,890
No thank you.

530
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:54,266
No problem, come along.

531
00:41:54,337 --> 00:41:56,134
Let her be, Abhimanyu.

532
00:41:56,339 --> 00:41:58,807
I guess she's going on a date.

533
00:42:00,043 --> 00:42:01,772
Are you going on a date?

534
00:42:05,215 --> 00:42:07,149
Abhimanyu, this is Inder.

535
00:42:08,685 --> 00:42:11,552
Inder, that's Abhimanyu,
Namrata and Sheetal.

536
00:42:14,791 --> 00:42:16,156
Shall we go home?

537
00:42:29,706 --> 00:42:31,697
Thanks for finding me a home.

538
00:42:36,813 --> 00:42:39,247
You can thank me
if you like the place.

539
00:42:41,351 --> 00:42:42,682
Thank you.

540
00:42:45,822 --> 00:42:47,881
Shall we?
- Yes.

541
00:43:37,574 --> 00:43:39,769
The place is really nice. Thank you.

542
00:43:40,143 --> 00:43:42,236
It looks a bit empty...

543
00:43:42,312 --> 00:43:45,975
...but tomorrow we'll
go buy vegetables and stuff.

544
00:43:46,316 --> 00:43:47,749
Okay.

545
00:43:49,185 --> 00:43:51,847
I can buy vegetables and stuff myself.

546
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:58,118
But if you come along...
I won't say no.

547
00:43:59,829 --> 00:44:00,921
Cool.

548
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:15,673
Do you always come
here to buy vegetables?

549
00:44:15,745 --> 00:44:18,270
This market is famous
for its reasonable price.

550
00:44:18,748 --> 00:44:21,876
Even dad... buys from here.

551
00:44:21,951 --> 00:44:23,145
This market is famous
for 'Thandai' (Drink) as well.

552
00:44:23,219 --> 00:44:24,709
How about some?

553
00:44:25,221 --> 00:44:26,119
How are you, Shankar?

554
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:28,188
Make two.

555
00:44:28,258 --> 00:44:31,125
The usual for me,
and plain one for her.

556
00:44:34,297 --> 00:44:36,663
This is your super-strong super-sexy.

557
00:44:36,733 --> 00:44:38,064
And plain one for you.

558
00:44:38,134 --> 00:44:39,863
Why is yours super-sexy?

559
00:44:40,203 --> 00:44:42,797
Because... it's laced
with Bholenath's offerings.

560
00:44:43,306 --> 00:44:45,274
Then I'll have it too.

561
00:44:57,053 --> 00:44:58,247
Shall we?

562
00:45:45,802 --> 00:45:47,736
"Mood's romantic tonight."

563
00:45:47,804 --> 00:45:49,328
"We've to get home by morning."

564
00:45:49,605 --> 00:45:51,664
"You've cast a spell on me."

565
00:45:52,909 --> 00:45:54,900
"The moment's blissful."

566
00:45:54,977 --> 00:45:56,672
"Let's not waste time anymore."

567
00:45:56,746 --> 00:45:59,647
"Let's enjoy this life, sweetheart."

568
00:46:00,116 --> 00:46:01,743
"So click my photo..."

569
00:46:01,818 --> 00:46:03,649
"So click my photo..."

570
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:07,212
"So click my photo... beloved"

571
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:09,121
"So click my photo..."

572
00:46:09,192 --> 00:46:10,989
"So click my photo..."

573
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:13,290
"So click my photo... beloved"

574
00:46:29,078 --> 00:46:32,741
"My heart's careless today."

575
00:46:32,815 --> 00:46:36,216
"You're in control... of me today."

576
00:46:36,285 --> 00:46:43,714
"Let the crazy world say...
what they want to say."

577
00:46:43,793 --> 00:46:47,251
"It's full of opportunities...
life's like a Ferrari."

578
00:46:47,330 --> 00:46:50,788
"Life is just like
you lived it till now."

579
00:46:50,867 --> 00:46:52,767
"Mood's romantic tonight."

580
00:46:52,835 --> 00:46:54,302
"We've to get home by morning."

581
00:46:54,570 --> 00:46:56,765
"You've cast a spell on me."

582
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:59,967
"The moment's blissful."

583
00:47:00,076 --> 00:47:01,600
"Let's not waste time anymore."

584
00:47:01,677 --> 00:47:04,009
"Let's enjoy this life, sweetheart."

585
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:06,812
"So click my photo..."

586
00:47:06,883 --> 00:47:08,578
"So click my photo..."

587
00:47:08,651 --> 00:47:12,143
"So click my photo... beloved"

588
00:47:12,755 --> 00:47:13,744
Will you take us to Five Gardens?

589
00:47:13,823 --> 00:47:16,986
There's a taxi strike, sir.
It will only end tomorrow morning.

590
00:47:17,627 --> 00:47:19,288
"So click my photo..."

591
00:47:19,562 --> 00:47:21,189
"So click my photo..."

592
00:47:21,264 --> 00:47:23,926
"So click my photo... beloved"

593
00:47:24,834 --> 00:47:26,699
"So click my photo..."

594
00:47:26,769 --> 00:47:28,532
"So click my photo..."

595
00:47:28,604 --> 00:47:31,038
"So click my photo... beloved"

596
00:47:57,633 --> 00:48:00,932
"Wearing a gown... of my dreams."

597
00:48:01,103 --> 00:48:04,664
"Even the nights... down."

598
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:08,198
"What happened... nothing yet?"

599
00:48:08,277 --> 00:48:11,906
"I'm just two drinks down."

600
00:48:11,981 --> 00:48:15,849
"We're not drunk,
the world's intoxicating."

601
00:48:15,918 --> 00:48:19,183
"Even if we drink water...
it tastes like tequila."

602
00:48:19,255 --> 00:48:21,018
"Mood's romantic tonight."

603
00:48:21,090 --> 00:48:22,785
"We've to get home by morning."

604
00:48:22,859 --> 00:48:25,225
"You've cast a spell on me."

605
00:48:26,128 --> 00:48:28,153
"The moment's blissful."

606
00:48:28,231 --> 00:48:30,028
"Let's not waste time anymore."

607
00:48:30,099 --> 00:48:32,260
"Let's enjoy this life, sweetheart."

608
00:48:33,269 --> 00:48:35,134
"So click my photo..."

609
00:48:35,204 --> 00:48:36,967
"So click my photo..."

610
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:40,634
"So click my photo... beloved"

611
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:42,268
"So click my photo..."

612
00:48:42,545 --> 00:48:44,172
"So click my photo..."

613
00:48:44,247 --> 00:48:46,943
"So click my photo... beloved"

614
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:52,280
How are you?

615
00:48:53,189 --> 00:48:54,281
All okay?

616
00:48:56,993 --> 00:48:58,858
Don't you want to
go see that computer guy?

617
00:48:59,228 --> 00:49:00,991
Yes, I do.

618
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,934
I had this library
book lying around with me.

619
00:49:07,036 --> 00:49:08,526
Will you return it?

620
00:49:11,274 --> 00:49:14,107
That drink was laced with cannabis,
wasn't it?

621
00:49:15,044 --> 00:49:16,136
Yes.

622
00:49:19,749 --> 00:49:22,183
Can you tell me what
kind of a drunkard am I?

623
00:49:22,885 --> 00:49:23,977
I didn't get you?

624
00:49:24,554 --> 00:49:25,953
I mean like some people
overdo everything...

625
00:49:26,055 --> 00:49:27,215
...when they are drunk.

626
00:49:27,290 --> 00:49:28,780
Like they laugh too much...
cry too much...

627
00:49:28,858 --> 00:49:31,952
What did I do?
So what kind of a drunkard am I?

628
00:49:34,230 --> 00:49:35,288
Romantic.

629
00:49:41,904 --> 00:49:44,065
Did I... embarrass you?

630
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:52,577
I'll get a beer for myself.

631
00:49:55,318 --> 00:50:01,257
Inder... drinking beer and
cannabis brew everyday can kill a man.

632
00:50:01,657 --> 00:50:03,215
Everyone has to die someday.

633
00:50:03,292 --> 00:50:05,123
Stay here, I'll be back.

634
00:50:05,895 --> 00:50:08,227
Don't say "So be it" to that God.

635
00:50:22,244 --> 00:50:23,871
Sir.

636
00:50:24,914 --> 00:50:27,883
That's someone's wallet. Give
it back... - What? What?

637
00:50:27,950 --> 00:50:29,349
Finders keepers, don't be too smart.

638
00:50:29,619 --> 00:50:33,988
What happened? - He stole his
wallet and not is returning it.

639
00:50:34,290 --> 00:50:37,657
She's lying sir.
This is my lucky purse.

640
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:46,998
Inder.

641
00:50:47,069 --> 00:50:47,763
Inder.

642
00:50:47,837 --> 00:50:48,929
It's someone's wallet.

643
00:50:49,005 --> 00:50:51,030
Why are you throwing it away?
We should return it.

644
00:50:51,307 --> 00:50:53,002
No need.
- Why?

645
00:50:53,075 --> 00:50:54,235
Because I said so.

646
00:50:54,310 --> 00:50:55,277
Inder, there are medicines in it.

647
00:50:55,344 --> 00:50:57,244
Someone might get sick
if he doesn't take it on time.

648
00:50:57,313 --> 00:51:00,077
Let him die, I don't care.
- But I do.

649
00:51:01,050 --> 00:51:02,244
Saru! Saru!

650
00:51:02,818 --> 00:51:04,012
Saru, stop this!

651
00:51:04,086 --> 00:51:04,984
Sir...

652
00:51:05,054 --> 00:51:06,248
Sir... Excuse me, sir...
- Hello, yes...

653
00:51:06,322 --> 00:51:09,223
I...
- Sir, your wallet.

654
00:51:14,563 --> 00:51:15,222
Thank you, dear.

655
00:51:15,297 --> 00:51:17,788
It fell down there... Inder.

656
00:51:17,867 --> 00:51:21,166
Inder... Inder... wait.

657
00:51:21,237 --> 00:51:22,932
Inder.
- Get lost!

658
00:51:35,051 --> 00:51:36,780
Can I drop you home, child?

659
00:51:38,587 --> 00:51:39,918
If you don't mind?

660
00:52:21,297 --> 00:52:22,855
Where are you going, sir?

661
00:52:22,932 --> 00:52:24,126
The library's closed, sir.

662
00:52:26,802 --> 00:52:27,996
Brother Inder.

663
00:52:32,808 --> 00:52:36,039
Saru hasn't come here.

664
00:52:36,812 --> 00:52:38,939
But she's been living
with you these days.

665
00:52:39,014 --> 00:52:41,107
Has there been a problem?

666
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:16,081
Saru.

667
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,251
Why didn't you go back home?

668
00:53:21,157 --> 00:53:22,749
You asked me to get lost, didn't you?

669
00:53:23,292 --> 00:53:25,852
Going back to the house
that you gave me after that

670
00:53:25,928 --> 00:53:27,862
...would mean I've no self-respect.

671
00:53:38,674 --> 00:53:40,232
I am a beast Saru!

672
00:53:45,781 --> 00:53:47,772
Are you sorry?
- Yes.

673
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:50,045
Then say you're sorry.
- Sorry!

674
00:54:11,907 --> 00:54:15,206
That guy whose wallet...
- Is your dad. I know.

675
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:20,146
There's a photo of
you two in this book.

676
00:54:20,683 --> 00:54:22,878
Renowned lawyer Rajenderlal Parihaar.

677
00:54:22,952 --> 00:54:24,783
With his son Inderlal Parihaar.

678
00:54:24,854 --> 00:54:26,788
In front of their 1 858 Oak tree...

679
00:54:26,856 --> 00:54:28,187
I hate him.

680
00:54:30,259 --> 00:54:31,624
I hate him!

681
00:54:38,901 --> 00:54:43,270
The day you hug him, all broken
strings of your heart, will be mended.

682
00:54:48,777 --> 00:54:50,108
Saru, isn't there some shortcut way...

683
00:54:50,179 --> 00:54:51,703
...so your dad can accept you back.

684
00:54:53,048 --> 00:54:54,072
There is.

685
00:54:54,149 --> 00:54:55,810
One impossible shortcut.

686
00:54:55,885 --> 00:54:57,113
Why impossible?

687
00:54:59,922 --> 00:55:04,518
If some llT... llM...
Brahmin Shashtri boy...

688
00:55:06,528 --> 00:55:08,086
...marries me.

689
00:55:09,632 --> 00:55:11,224
Then he might accept me back.

690
00:55:12,801 --> 00:55:14,701
At least for blessing me.

691
00:55:16,672 --> 00:55:18,003
Then get married.

692
00:55:21,210 --> 00:55:23,872
No one wants to marry this ugly frump.

693
00:55:26,015 --> 00:55:27,607
Ugly frump!

694
00:55:30,552 --> 00:55:31,712
I see.

695
00:55:36,125 --> 00:55:37,319
Brother, can you take us to Dharavi?

696
00:55:38,294 --> 00:55:39,158
Let's go.

697
00:55:39,228 --> 00:55:40,559
Why Dharavi?

698
00:55:47,269 --> 00:55:49,294
Inder, why did we come here?

699
00:55:49,571 --> 00:55:51,903
Is this place decent?
- Don't worry

700
00:55:51,974 --> 00:55:54,966
Even Ruby orders all
her stock from Mustakeen Bhai.

701
00:55:55,044 --> 00:55:56,011
Bhai?

702
00:55:56,345 --> 00:55:59,075
He's the biggest smuggler
in Mumbai for designer stuff.

703
00:55:59,148 --> 00:56:02,083
Smuggler. I want to go back.

704
00:56:02,151 --> 00:56:05,917
Trust me... he maybe be a smuggler,
but he's an amazing artist.

705
00:56:08,023 --> 00:56:09,285
Makeover king.

706
00:56:12,528 --> 00:56:15,292
Greetings, Mustakeen bhai.
- Greetings.

707
00:56:16,665 --> 00:56:18,895
Bring your booty forward, Inder.

708
00:56:18,968 --> 00:56:19,935
Booty!

709
00:56:20,602 --> 00:56:23,264
Inder, let's go back.
I don't want a makeover.

710
00:56:27,609 --> 00:56:28,906
Stop this, Inder.

711
00:57:09,651 --> 00:57:12,085
"You can check on Wikipedia."

712
00:57:12,154 --> 00:57:14,679
"You can search on Google."

713
00:57:14,757 --> 00:57:17,191
"You can even look around, dear."

714
00:57:17,259 --> 00:57:21,958
"You won't find a beloved like him."

715
00:57:22,197 --> 00:57:27,191
"No .1... No .1... No .1... No .1..."

716
00:57:27,269 --> 00:57:29,794
"No .1... No .1..."

717
00:57:29,872 --> 00:57:32,306
"There's a magic in your eyes..."

718
00:57:32,574 --> 00:57:34,838
"...you turn my world around."

719
00:57:34,910 --> 00:57:37,606
"You look at me and go...
oh... oh... oh..."

720
00:57:37,679 --> 00:57:39,977
"Don't you ever leave and go."

721
00:57:40,049 --> 00:57:42,574
"You can check on Wikipedia."

722
00:57:42,651 --> 00:57:44,949
"You can search on Google."

723
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:47,716
"You can even look around, dear."

724
00:57:47,790 --> 00:57:52,284
"You won't find a beloved like him."

725
00:57:52,661 --> 00:58:00,090
"No .1... No .1... No .1... No .1..."

726
00:58:00,169 --> 00:58:02,729
"I've no peace without you."

727
00:58:02,805 --> 00:58:05,501
"My days and night
are restless without you."

728
00:58:05,574 --> 00:58:07,667
"You've stolen my heart away."

729
00:58:09,278 --> 00:58:10,267
"See you baby."

730
00:58:10,546 --> 00:58:12,912
"You can check on Wikipedia."

731
00:58:12,981 --> 00:58:15,142
"You can search on Google."

732
00:58:15,217 --> 00:58:17,811
"You can even look around, dear."

733
00:58:17,886 --> 00:58:22,550
"You won't find a beloved like him."

734
00:58:22,925 --> 00:58:30,525
"No .1... No .1... No .1... No .1..."

735
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:57,183
"No one understood this bond,
beloved."

736
00:58:57,693 --> 00:59:07,500
"It's complete...
yet incomplete... sweetheart."

737
00:59:08,637 --> 00:59:11,105
"I've no peace without you."

738
00:59:11,173 --> 00:59:13,698
"My days and night
are restless without you."

739
00:59:13,775 --> 00:59:16,209
"You've stolen my heart away."

740
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:18,869
"See you baby."

741
00:59:18,947 --> 00:59:21,177
"You can check on Wikipedia."

742
00:59:21,250 --> 00:59:23,878
"You can search on Google."

743
00:59:23,952 --> 00:59:26,580
"You can even look around, dear."

744
00:59:26,655 --> 00:59:31,149
"You won't find a beloved like him."

745
00:59:31,293 --> 00:59:38,893
"No .1... No .1... No .1... No .1..."

746
00:59:38,967 --> 00:59:43,927
"No .1... No .1... No .1... No .1..."

747
00:59:44,072 --> 00:59:46,768
Mustakin bhai has
given some gifts for you.

748
00:59:51,213 --> 00:59:51,975
Let's go.

749
00:59:52,181 --> 00:59:53,773
How do I look?

750
01:00:01,790 --> 01:00:04,691
No one will ever call
you an ugly frump again.

751
01:00:12,734 --> 01:00:17,194
Mom, Kaveri and... dad will
be really happy to see me like this.

752
01:00:23,145 --> 01:00:24,669
Then let's go show them.

753
01:00:26,782 --> 01:00:29,649
No, Inder. It's a bad idea.
- No, it's not.

754
01:00:39,228 --> 01:00:41,253
Saru. Let's go.

755
01:01:03,252 --> 01:01:06,779
I'll tie my hair...
or should I let it be like this.

756
01:01:07,990 --> 01:01:09,082
Let it be the way it is.

757
01:01:09,157 --> 01:01:10,784
You're looking nice.

758
01:01:51,066 --> 01:01:53,694
The name of the deceased?

759
01:01:54,803 --> 01:01:56,236
Saraswati.

760
01:01:59,207 --> 01:02:01,141
And 'Clan'... Kaundanyesya!

761
01:02:46,054 --> 01:02:48,750
I completely forgot how
disappointing parents can be.

762
01:02:55,130 --> 01:02:56,859
What will you do now, Saru?

763
01:02:57,199 --> 01:02:58,166
Huh!

764
01:03:02,637 --> 01:03:07,131
I... l'm not some loser who'll give up.

765
01:03:10,912 --> 01:03:13,176
I will go to the
office as this new Saru.

766
01:03:14,282 --> 01:03:17,911
When someone compliments me,
I'll say thank you.

767
01:03:20,288 --> 01:03:21,619
Inder...

768
01:03:23,258 --> 01:03:28,753
...I won't waste this
pretty face that you gave me.

769
01:03:31,833 --> 01:03:34,825
And when some suitable
boy falls for this face and says...

770
01:03:35,737 --> 01:03:37,170
"Marry me Saru."

771
01:03:38,340 --> 01:03:40,274
I'll say "Yes, please".

772
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:46,609
I will come meet dad.

773
01:03:48,750 --> 01:03:51,776
And he'll take that photo down.

774
01:03:53,121 --> 01:03:55,885
He'll hug me... and say...

775
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:00,250
Bless you.

776
01:04:01,563 --> 01:04:03,656
May you have a long life.

777
01:04:48,310 --> 01:04:49,777
Not well, Saru?

778
01:04:52,681 --> 01:04:53,978
Are you alright?

779
01:04:56,017 --> 01:04:58,212
I am okay, thank you.

780
01:04:59,588 --> 01:05:04,287
What's the motivation behind
this amazing, mind-blowing makeover?

781
01:05:08,897 --> 01:05:10,558
Tell me, I am waiting.

782
01:05:14,636 --> 01:05:18,732
So that I can trap some llT... llM.

783
01:05:19,908 --> 01:05:20,897
Really?

784
01:05:20,976 --> 01:05:22,534
I'll see you.

785
01:05:24,980 --> 01:05:26,572
See you!

786
01:05:29,150 --> 01:05:32,176
Hi... can I speak with
Saraswati Parthasaarthy.

787
01:05:32,254 --> 01:05:34,950
Saru's got flu, so she
didn't come to the library today.

788
01:05:35,023 --> 01:05:36,251
Okay.

789
01:05:41,196 --> 01:05:45,189
Excuse me. Saru's back?
- No, she's still got flu.

790
01:05:45,267 --> 01:05:48,293
Otherwise Saru taking
a leave... is impossible.

791
01:06:00,348 --> 01:06:03,283
You didn't tell me you had flu.
- It was just a viral.

792
01:06:03,552 --> 01:06:05,019
Nothing serious.

793
01:06:05,854 --> 01:06:08,254
That party boy's
been looking for you.

794
01:06:10,725 --> 01:06:13,250
That... Abhimanyu... What's his name?

795
01:06:15,297 --> 01:06:16,559
Shashtri.

796
01:06:16,631 --> 01:06:17,620
Right.

797
01:06:19,267 --> 01:06:21,235
He didn't have your number.

798
01:06:21,903 --> 01:06:24,531
No. thank God.

799
01:06:24,606 --> 01:06:27,803
Why? Is he bothering you?
- No!

800
01:06:33,548 --> 01:06:35,277
Then why are you avoiding him?

801
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:40,951
Why are you avoiding him?

802
01:06:41,890 --> 01:06:43,983
Because every time I open
my mouth in front of him...

803
01:06:44,092 --> 01:06:46,583
...I say something idiotic.

804
01:06:47,295 --> 01:06:48,990
Don't ask why?

805
01:06:50,699 --> 01:06:51,893
Why?

806
01:06:56,738 --> 01:06:59,298
You got a job, didn't you?
- What?

807
01:07:01,009 --> 01:07:03,534
This file... You got a job!

808
01:07:05,046 --> 01:07:06,673
Congratulations.

809
01:07:08,783 --> 01:07:12,048
This isn't a file of my
resumes... it's got a list of boys.

810
01:07:12,687 --> 01:07:15,178
All of them are llTs... llMs.

811
01:07:16,558 --> 01:07:18,651
Next week they're coming to see you.

812
01:07:19,628 --> 01:07:21,994
You'll definitely
like someone for sure.

813
01:07:39,147 --> 01:07:40,239
Saru.

814
01:07:40,782 --> 01:07:42,909
Hi.
- Hi.

815
01:07:43,318 --> 01:07:46,583
How's your health now?
- Good.

816
01:07:48,256 --> 01:07:52,158
I've been trying to
meet you for the past few days.

817
01:07:53,695 --> 01:07:57,631
I wanted to ask whether... you're free.

818
01:07:59,167 --> 01:08:00,327
Today?

819
01:08:00,568 --> 01:08:03,196
No! For the next 80-90 years.

820
01:08:03,638 --> 01:08:10,009
If you're free...
we can hang out... together.

821
01:08:14,249 --> 01:08:15,716
What do you...

822
01:08:16,017 --> 01:08:17,541
What do you mean?

823
01:08:18,153 --> 01:08:24,114
That you've trapped this llT... llM...

824
01:08:27,629 --> 01:08:29,859
I know this is very sudden.

825
01:08:30,799 --> 01:08:34,064
But this feeling was just as sudden.

826
01:08:34,936 --> 01:08:40,841
That day when you went on a date,
I didn't like it at all.

827
01:08:43,144 --> 01:08:45,612
And when you got this makeover...

828
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:48,240
...I hoped that you did it for me.

829
01:08:50,785 --> 01:08:53,117
And when you didn't
come to the office...

830
01:08:53,888 --> 01:08:56,880
...I realised that you...

831
01:08:57,926 --> 01:08:59,791
You're the one, Saru...

832
01:09:02,797 --> 01:09:04,196
Will you...

833
01:09:05,133 --> 01:09:06,725
Will you marry me?

834
01:09:39,834 --> 01:09:40,732
Saru.

835
01:09:40,802 --> 01:09:41,894
What's the emergency?

836
01:09:41,970 --> 01:09:43,631
Good news. Come on.

837
01:09:44,706 --> 01:09:47,903
The no .8 guy in this
file is waiting for you.

838
01:09:47,976 --> 01:09:49,273
Upstairs, in the restaurant.

839
01:09:50,712 --> 01:09:53,078
He's llT... llM... and MIT as well.

840
01:09:53,548 --> 01:09:54,981
Your dad will really love him.

841
01:09:55,049 --> 01:09:57,779
Abhimanyu came to see
me during the lunch break.

842
01:09:59,187 --> 01:10:00,586
You mean that party boy.

843
01:10:02,223 --> 01:10:05,681
That party boy is llT... llM...
- I see.

844
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:07,318
Brahmin... Shashtri.

845
01:10:08,029 --> 01:10:10,156
Seems like the answer
to your dad's prayers.

846
01:10:10,231 --> 01:10:11,323
Come on.

847
01:10:12,967 --> 01:10:14,867
He wants to marry me.

848
01:10:17,605 --> 01:10:18,902
What do I do?

849
01:10:23,011 --> 01:10:24,035
Say yes.

850
01:10:53,775 --> 01:11:00,305
"My heart fell in the
captivity of memories."

851
01:11:00,381 --> 01:11:07,116
"This love has shattered
it into pieces."

852
01:11:07,188 --> 01:11:13,821
"Our meeting wasn't a coincidence."

853
01:11:13,895 --> 01:11:20,323
"O benefactor.
"O benefactor. "O benefactor."

854
01:11:20,602 --> 01:11:27,132
"Our meeting wasn't a coincidence."

855
01:11:27,208 --> 01:11:34,341
"O benefactor.
"O benefactor. "O benefactor."

856
01:11:42,223 --> 01:11:45,192
Will you please come
along to shop for my wedding?

857
01:11:46,194 --> 01:11:48,094
Everything I selected

858
01:11:48,162 --> 01:11:50,130
...I looked like the old Saru.

859
01:11:50,198 --> 01:11:51,859
Please, Inder.

860
01:11:53,034 --> 01:11:54,763
I want to look beautiful that day.

861
01:12:01,309 --> 01:12:04,745
"You love someone else."

862
01:12:04,812 --> 01:12:07,975
"You think about someone else."

863
01:12:08,049 --> 01:12:13,146
"The heart cannot accept this."

864
01:12:14,756 --> 01:12:18,055
"There's a spark of separation."

865
01:12:18,126 --> 01:12:21,323
"What's this fire?"

866
01:12:21,596 --> 01:12:27,034
"My yearning for you has killed me."

867
01:12:27,101 --> 01:12:33,563
"Our meeting wasn't a coincidence."

868
01:12:33,641 --> 01:12:41,104
"O benefactor.
"O benefactor. "O benefactor."

869
01:13:10,945 --> 01:13:12,970
Hi.
- What's this?

870
01:13:13,748 --> 01:13:15,215
Post marriage,
Abhimanyu is taking up a job...

871
01:13:15,283 --> 01:13:16,875
...in the Turkey bureau.

872
01:13:17,585 --> 01:13:19,917
Blood test was compulsory
for the visa...

873
01:13:19,988 --> 01:13:22,115
...so I had to go to the hospital...
- You're going to Turkey?

874
01:13:32,834 --> 01:13:34,096
First card...

875
01:13:35,303 --> 01:13:36,770
For you!

876
01:13:47,048 --> 01:13:49,016
Inder, if you don't come...

877
01:13:49,851 --> 01:13:51,819
...l'll have no one
who will be my own.

878
01:13:56,090 --> 01:13:59,321
"This void will stay with me..."

879
01:13:59,594 --> 01:14:02,757
"...no matter where I go."

880
01:14:02,830 --> 01:14:07,767
"I can't be patient."

881
01:14:09,203 --> 01:14:16,006
"In this colorless world of mine..."

882
01:14:16,077 --> 01:14:21,743
"...I wonder why your
name gives me relief."

883
01:14:21,816 --> 01:14:28,085
"Our meeting wasn't a coincidence."

884
01:14:28,156 --> 01:14:29,248
Sir...

885
01:14:29,323 --> 01:14:31,848
Sir... Saru's wedding card.

886
01:14:32,927 --> 01:14:36,021
Sir... the guy's llT... just
like you wanted.

887
01:14:37,131 --> 01:14:40,623
Sir, if you don't come... she'll
have no one of her own at her wedding.

888
01:14:41,869 --> 01:14:43,803
Sir, please take it.

889
01:14:44,172 --> 01:14:51,044
"Our meeting wasn't a coincidence."

890
01:14:51,112 --> 01:14:57,711
"O benefactor.
"O benefactor. "O benefactor."

891
01:14:57,785 --> 01:15:04,122
"My heart fell in the
captivity of memories."

892
01:15:04,192 --> 01:15:10,893
"This love has shattered
it into pieces."

893
01:15:10,965 --> 01:15:17,666
"Our meeting wasn't a coincidence."

894
01:15:17,738 --> 01:15:25,702
"O benefactor.
"O benefactor. "O benefactor."

895
01:15:39,060 --> 01:15:41,551
Hello, where's the groom?

896
01:15:41,629 --> 01:15:43,062
Come, Saru.

897
01:15:43,764 --> 01:15:46,028
He's picking up his parents
from the airport. He'll be here soon.

898
01:15:53,674 --> 01:15:57,701
I'll go get Abhimanyu.
- Yeah.

899
01:16:04,218 --> 01:16:07,119
Congratulations.
- Thank you.

900
01:16:49,697 --> 01:16:53,326
Inder... the registrar's calling.

901
01:17:00,074 --> 01:17:02,235
Yes, mister. Where's the guy?

902
01:17:02,510 --> 01:17:04,603
How much longer will I have to wait?

903
01:17:04,679 --> 01:17:07,079
Sir, he must be stuck in
traffic... that's why he's late.

904
01:17:07,148 --> 01:17:08,547
He'll be here any minute.

905
01:17:08,783 --> 01:17:10,250
This is too much, mister.

906
01:17:10,518 --> 01:17:13,043
He's already 40 minutes late.

907
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:14,951
There are other people
waiting outside.

908
01:17:15,022 --> 01:17:20,619
Do me a favour, step out so that I can
marry those whose groom have arrived,

909
01:18:04,872 --> 01:18:05,930
Come in.

910
01:18:07,675 --> 01:18:10,667
Did someone die
that you didn't turn up?

911
01:18:13,948 --> 01:18:15,575
Why, Abhimanyu?

912
01:18:20,755 --> 01:18:22,746
My parents have said no
to this marriage.

913
01:18:25,826 --> 01:18:27,157
I am sorry.

914
01:18:30,197 --> 01:18:31,129
Inder...

915
01:18:33,534 --> 01:18:35,297
...he doesn't want to marry me.

916
01:18:44,545 --> 01:18:46,945
If there's a misunderstanding,
then let's sit down and clear it.

917
01:18:48,182 --> 01:18:51,242
The registrar's still waiting.
You two can still get married.

918
01:18:51,786 --> 01:18:54,880
What marriage? What are you saying?

919
01:18:55,289 --> 01:18:57,120
You should punch him!

920
01:18:57,191 --> 01:18:58,920
Punch him!
Punch him!

921
01:18:58,993 --> 01:19:00,858
Punch him!
Punch him!

922
01:19:00,895 --> 01:19:01,884
Punch him!
Punch him!

923
01:19:01,962 --> 01:19:03,054
Punch him!

924
01:19:08,536 --> 01:19:09,764
Saru!

925
01:19:11,272 --> 01:19:14,036
Abhimanyu! Just a minute!

926
01:19:23,784 --> 01:19:28,187
A girl whose last rites have been performed
by the family while she's still alive...

927
01:19:28,723 --> 01:19:30,987
...we cannot accept
such a girl in our family.

928
01:19:31,225 --> 01:19:33,022
It's impossible.

929
01:19:33,094 --> 01:19:34,789
We're not so liberal minded.

930
01:19:35,563 --> 01:19:38,760
Today when Abhimanyu told
us about it at the airport...

931
01:19:38,833 --> 01:19:40,824
...we made it clear to him...

932
01:19:40,901 --> 01:19:43,131
This marriage isn't possible.

933
01:19:43,738 --> 01:19:47,936
And if he goes ahead... then
we won't be a part of it.

934
01:20:04,658 --> 01:20:09,118
You said that... their
approval is just a formality.

935
01:20:11,866 --> 01:20:13,993
If you say yes... they'll say yes.

936
01:20:38,225 --> 01:20:39,852
You should've punched him.

937
01:20:40,694 --> 01:20:41,888
Why didn't you?

938
01:20:42,196 --> 01:20:43,629
Why didn't you punch him?

939
01:20:43,697 --> 01:20:44,959
Why didn't you?

940
01:20:45,199 --> 01:20:46,689
Why didn't you punch him?

941
01:20:46,801 --> 01:20:48,063
Why didn't you punch him?

942
01:20:49,103 --> 01:20:51,663
If I had punched him... it
would've ended everything.

943
01:20:54,308 --> 01:20:58,005
And... you wouldn't
get a second chance...

944
01:20:58,078 --> 01:20:59,067
...to say sorry, I love you.

945
01:20:59,146 --> 01:21:00,113
Sorry...

946
01:21:00,181 --> 01:21:02,206
He doesn't deserve sorry, I love you.

947
01:21:02,283 --> 01:21:04,308
He doesn't deserve a second chance.

948
01:21:04,585 --> 01:21:07,315
All this that you're doing...

949
01:21:07,588 --> 01:21:09,021
...he doesn't deserve all this.

950
01:21:09,089 --> 01:21:11,284
He doesn't deserve it.
He doesn't deserve anything.

951
01:21:11,559 --> 01:21:13,186
He doesn't deserve anything.

952
01:21:27,708 --> 01:21:37,015
"My restlessness would get some peace"

953
01:21:37,618 --> 01:21:45,115
"Whenever I see your face"

954
01:21:45,693 --> 01:21:53,361
"Whenever I see your face"

955
01:21:53,934 --> 01:22:03,070
"My madness gets some patience."

956
01:22:03,711 --> 01:22:11,311
"Whenever I see your face"

957
01:22:11,719 --> 01:22:17,248
"Every time someone
mentions your name."

958
01:22:17,725 --> 01:22:26,155
"My love for you starts flowing
from my eyes like tears."

959
01:22:31,839 --> 01:22:33,773
Mr. And Mrs. Abhimanyu Shastri.

960
01:22:33,841 --> 01:22:35,103
Congratulations.

961
01:22:35,175 --> 01:22:36,574
This is your honeymoon suite.

962
01:22:36,644 --> 01:22:37,269
Enjoy your stay.

963
01:22:37,344 --> 01:22:38,777
Saru, wait a minute.

964
01:22:39,980 --> 01:22:41,345
Saru, stop this.

965
01:22:41,749 --> 01:22:43,114
Stop what, Inder.

966
01:22:43,350 --> 01:22:45,045
Two days advance
has already been paid.

967
01:22:45,119 --> 01:22:46,177
Why waste it?

968
01:22:46,253 --> 01:22:48,153
And anyway,
I can't go back to the house.

969
01:22:48,722 --> 01:22:50,781
You can go, if you want to.

970
01:22:51,992 --> 01:22:53,653
Go.
- Saru...

971
01:23:00,834 --> 01:23:04,793
"Day and night I pray
for only one thing."

972
01:23:04,872 --> 01:23:08,569
"That I love and die for you."

973
01:23:08,909 --> 01:23:12,538
"Every time I look around,
I see only you."

974
01:23:12,613 --> 01:23:16,811
"And I want to surrender
my world to you."

975
01:23:16,884 --> 01:23:22,550
"Every time someone
mentions your name."

976
01:23:22,923 --> 01:23:31,262
"I can feel your lips on mine."

977
01:23:31,332 --> 01:23:40,900
"All my paths find their destination."

978
01:23:41,141 --> 01:23:48,980
"Whenever I see your face"

979
01:23:49,183 --> 01:23:57,090
"Whenever I see your face"

980
01:24:01,795 --> 01:24:06,129
See Inder... even though
I have become beautiful...

981
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:09,530
...no one wants to marry me.

982
01:24:41,969 --> 01:24:44,130
You'll hate me for
this tomorrow, Saru.

983
01:24:44,772 --> 01:24:46,296
Please.

984
01:24:50,744 --> 01:24:58,617
"The tasteless winds just gave me
a whiff of your scent."

985
01:24:58,852 --> 01:25:02,913
"Love is a dangerous thing."

986
01:25:02,990 --> 01:25:06,721
"Someday it will kill me."

987
01:25:06,794 --> 01:25:12,255
"Every time someone
mentions your name."

988
01:25:12,866 --> 01:25:21,001
"Every moment narrates your tale."

989
01:25:21,241 --> 01:25:30,741
"Every yearning of
mine gets comforted.

990
01:25:31,051 --> 01:25:39,015
"Whenever I see your face"

991
01:25:39,093 --> 01:25:47,899
"Whenever I see your face"

992
01:27:03,811 --> 01:27:05,642
"Abhimanyu came to see me."

993
01:27:06,213 --> 01:27:10,274
"I don't know whether
I should say sorry, thanks..."

994
01:27:10,551 --> 01:27:11,779
"...or goodbye."

995
01:27:41,281 --> 01:27:42,578
Hello.

996
01:27:47,721 --> 01:27:48,813
Please be seated.

997
01:28:00,834 --> 01:28:03,132
Kaveri's getting married on the 27 th.

998
01:28:07,674 --> 01:28:10,006
Saru doesn't answer my phone.

999
01:28:13,580 --> 01:28:16,276
Can you please give her this card?

1000
01:28:16,550 --> 01:28:18,984
I've stopped seeing Saru.

1001
01:28:43,243 --> 01:28:45,108
And I am leaving this city.

1002
01:28:51,585 --> 01:28:54,611
Alright, son. See you.

1003
01:28:58,892 --> 01:28:59,881
I will...

1004
01:29:01,194 --> 01:29:03,025
I will give this card to Saru.

1005
01:29:09,102 --> 01:29:10,865
Take care of yourself.

1006
01:29:18,845 --> 01:29:21,245
Saraswati.
- She doesn't work here anymore.

1007
01:29:23,684 --> 01:29:26,050
Any information about her?
- No.

1008
01:29:30,691 --> 01:29:31,885
Excuse me.

1009
01:29:32,626 --> 01:29:34,958
Can you give this
to Abhimanyu Shashtri?

1010
01:29:35,162 --> 01:29:36,720
Thanks.

1011
01:29:49,076 --> 01:29:50,270
Inder.

1012
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:55,272
I can't give this card to Saru?

1013
01:29:59,152 --> 01:29:59,982
Why?

1014
01:30:00,053 --> 01:30:03,216
Since our marriage broke up,
we're not in touch.

1015
01:30:04,591 --> 01:30:05,615
That's a lie.

1016
01:30:07,327 --> 01:30:09,921
You came to see her at the resort...
she was with you.

1017
01:30:09,997 --> 01:30:11,259
I saw it myself.

1018
01:30:13,233 --> 01:30:15,758
Yes, I did come.
We had some personal conversation.

1019
01:30:16,803 --> 01:30:18,930
After that she went her way,
and I went mine.

1020
01:30:25,078 --> 01:30:26,306
What do you mean by 'her way'?

1021
01:30:27,314 --> 01:30:28,975
She must have given you some address?

1022
01:30:29,716 --> 01:30:30,614
No.

1023
01:30:31,084 --> 01:30:32,711
Any message for her family.

1024
01:30:37,624 --> 01:30:38,613
I am sorry.

1025
01:30:42,362 --> 01:30:43,795
Abhimanyu.

1026
01:30:46,633 --> 01:30:48,066
Any message for me?

1027
01:30:48,835 --> 01:30:50,029
No!

1028
01:31:44,724 --> 01:31:46,021
I have a gun.

1029
01:31:47,227 --> 01:31:49,855
And next time you go
anywhere without telling me...

1030
01:31:49,930 --> 01:31:52,797
...l'll put all six
bullets here and here!

1031
01:31:53,767 --> 01:31:54,995
Get it?

1032
01:31:55,068 --> 01:31:56,035
What?

1033
01:31:56,736 --> 01:31:57,828
What?

1034
01:31:58,972 --> 01:32:01,236
Won't you even say hello?
- No.

1035
01:32:04,711 --> 01:32:06,201
Why not?

1036
01:32:08,148 --> 01:32:11,584
Because after a sympathy fling,
you don't say hello.

1037
01:32:11,885 --> 01:32:12,977
You avoid each other.

1038
01:32:13,320 --> 01:32:16,187
I see... so that's why you're running.

1039
01:32:16,590 --> 01:32:17,955
Because you're embarrassed.

1040
01:32:18,024 --> 01:32:19,616
Saru, grow up.

1041
01:32:19,693 --> 01:32:23,220
I didn't run. I messaged you.

1042
01:32:23,797 --> 01:32:25,890
Didn't you get it? Huh!

1043
01:32:31,104 --> 01:32:34,073
I did... and I let you go because...

1044
01:32:34,141 --> 01:32:37,838
...I thought you're starting
a life with that Abhimanyu.

1045
01:32:38,912 --> 01:32:43,315
Saru... why are you
wandering in the jungles?

1046
01:32:44,818 --> 01:32:46,843
Why are you wandering
in the jungles like a hippie?

1047
01:32:47,320 --> 01:32:48,309
Tell me...

1048
01:32:48,922 --> 01:32:50,981
Who are you to ask me that?

1049
01:32:56,596 --> 01:33:01,056
Saru. You tell me...
who am I to you after that night?

1050
01:33:01,601 --> 01:33:03,694
The night's gone...
the matter's over, Inder

1051
01:33:06,606 --> 01:33:08,096
Whatever happened that night...

1052
01:33:08,675 --> 01:33:11,041
...was only a moment
to forget Abhinamyu.

1053
01:33:11,645 --> 01:33:13,237
It wasn't anything special.

1054
01:33:13,313 --> 01:33:15,213
It wasn't anything wow!

1055
01:33:16,550 --> 01:33:17,608
Get it?

1056
01:33:19,186 --> 01:33:21,211
Now just leave me alone.

1057
01:33:22,856 --> 01:33:24,255
Leave me alone.

1058
01:34:11,905 --> 01:34:13,770
Now tell me who I am.

1059
01:34:14,608 --> 01:34:16,872
Tell me who I am to you.

1060
01:34:17,110 --> 01:34:18,668
Saru?

1061
01:34:18,745 --> 01:34:20,110
Saru?

1062
01:34:20,714 --> 01:34:22,147
Saru?

1063
01:34:22,749 --> 01:34:23,909
Saru?

1064
01:34:33,560 --> 01:34:36,654
I strictly forbade Saraswati
from going to high altitudes.

1065
01:34:36,730 --> 01:34:38,163
She's got Meningioma.

1066
01:34:39,599 --> 01:34:41,726
A deep tumor in the brain.

1067
01:34:42,035 --> 01:34:43,900
We can't operate on it.

1068
01:34:43,970 --> 01:34:46,063
And nor can we do chemo.

1069
01:34:46,139 --> 01:34:48,573
That's why we're treating
her with oral medicines.

1070
01:34:49,175 --> 01:34:52,201
In such cases,
diagnoses is also difficult.

1071
01:34:52,279 --> 01:34:53,940
Because there are
no visible symptoms...

1072
01:34:54,014 --> 01:34:55,845
...other than headache and fever.

1073
01:34:55,915 --> 01:34:57,906
And I had explained
this to Saru and her fianc.

1074
01:34:57,984 --> 01:34:59,281
Hold on.

1075
01:35:00,086 --> 01:35:02,054
Abhimanyu.
- Yeah.

1076
01:35:06,826 --> 01:35:08,191
Yes, Mr. Mehta.

1077
01:35:13,667 --> 01:35:15,897
You broke-off with
her because of her illness.

1078
01:35:15,969 --> 01:35:19,166
I received the reports just few
hours after I broke off the marriage.

1079
01:35:19,906 --> 01:35:21,203
If I had known about this earlier...

1080
01:35:21,274 --> 01:35:23,242
...I would've never hurt Saru.

1081
01:35:24,744 --> 01:35:28,840
My office conducted some
routine medical tests for the visa.

1082
01:35:29,049 --> 01:35:32,780
That's why the doctor
called me first, not Saru.

1083
01:35:34,220 --> 01:35:36,245
I am not proud of myself.

1084
01:35:37,190 --> 01:35:39,852
I kept looking for Saru
all night with the reports.

1085
01:35:39,926 --> 01:35:42,258
Next day when I met her
at the Resort I said sorry.

1086
01:35:42,329 --> 01:35:44,229
Asked for a second chance.

1087
01:35:44,898 --> 01:35:46,160
But she didn't agree.

1088
01:35:48,234 --> 01:35:50,202
She said that I was lucky...

1089
01:35:50,270 --> 01:35:51,703
If I hadn't broke off the marriage...

1090
01:35:51,771 --> 01:35:54,797
...then I would have been stuck with
a wife with tumor.

1091
01:36:03,550 --> 01:36:07,111
I came asking you whether
she left a message for me or not...

1092
01:36:07,721 --> 01:36:09,018
Remember?

1093
01:36:09,556 --> 01:36:10,853
Why did you lie to me?

1094
01:36:13,126 --> 01:36:15,185
You won't tell Inder anything.

1095
01:36:16,162 --> 01:36:18,187
That's one promise she took from me.

1096
01:36:19,132 --> 01:36:21,225
Otherwise... I would've
told you everything.

1097
01:36:22,068 --> 01:36:24,798
You can break a marriage,
but not a promise.

1098
01:36:27,707 --> 01:36:29,174
How is Saru?

1099
01:36:33,146 --> 01:36:34,875
Even if you know, what will you do?

1100
01:37:05,779 --> 01:37:07,178
Excuse me, sir.

1101
01:37:07,947 --> 01:37:09,608
The patient's stuff.

1102
01:37:41,181 --> 01:37:42,876
Thank you.

1103
01:38:18,751 --> 01:38:21,185
Will you make me sit at
the party with the saline?

1104
01:38:23,056 --> 01:38:26,116
Did you threaten the doctor
with a gun to convince him?

1105
01:38:30,096 --> 01:38:31,290
Where's the party?

1106
01:38:37,904 --> 01:38:39,166
It's a surprise.

1107
01:38:41,174 --> 01:38:42,835
I like surprises.

1108
01:39:44,604 --> 01:39:50,907
"My heart's only loved you."

1109
01:39:50,977 --> 01:39:57,109
"You're the only one I prayed for."

1110
01:39:57,283 --> 01:40:02,550
"Your absence is like a curse."

1111
01:40:03,756 --> 01:40:09,023
"Your absence is like a curse."

1112
01:40:10,096 --> 01:40:16,296
"If you go away... I will die."

1113
01:40:16,569 --> 01:40:19,834
"Sweetheart I swear on you."

1114
01:40:19,906 --> 01:40:22,932
"Sweetheart I swear on you."

1115
01:40:23,009 --> 01:40:26,137
"Sweetheart I swear on you."

1116
01:40:26,813 --> 01:40:32,342
"Every time I see you,
my eyes get wet with tears."

1117
01:40:32,619 --> 01:40:35,884
"Sweetheart I swear on you."

1118
01:40:35,955 --> 01:40:38,947
"Sweetheart I swear on you."

1119
01:40:39,025 --> 01:40:42,358
"Sweetheart I swear on you."

1120
01:40:57,110 --> 01:40:59,908
Dad's looking so handsome, isn't he?

1121
01:41:01,781 --> 01:41:03,942
Mom got that antique necklace...

1122
01:41:05,184 --> 01:41:07,277
She was asking for it for so long.

1123
01:41:11,257 --> 01:41:13,782
That's my uncle from Vizag.

1124
01:41:14,994 --> 01:41:16,188
My father's brother.

1125
01:41:18,331 --> 01:41:20,231
Whenever he says something...

1126
01:41:20,299 --> 01:41:23,063
...at the end of every
sentence he does this...

1127
01:41:25,304 --> 01:41:28,865
Look... look... he did it again...
he does it all the time.

1128
01:41:30,977 --> 01:41:37,177
"My heart's... addicted to you."

1129
01:41:37,250 --> 01:41:43,155
"Don't ever... betray me."

1130
01:41:43,322 --> 01:41:49,158
"I am used to you... it's not my fault."

1131
01:41:49,228 --> 01:41:55,656
"Without you... it's impossible to live."

1132
01:41:55,735 --> 01:42:02,004
"You're the only one I prayed for."

1133
01:42:02,075 --> 01:42:06,910
"Your absence is like a curse."

1134
01:42:08,314 --> 01:42:14,219
"If you go away... I will die."

1135
01:42:14,787 --> 01:42:17,984
"Sweetheart I swear on you."

1136
01:42:18,057 --> 01:42:21,117
"Sweetheart I swear on you."

1137
01:42:21,194 --> 01:42:24,186
"Sweetheart I swear on you."

1138
01:42:24,997 --> 01:42:30,799
"Every time I see you,
my eyes get wet with tears."

1139
01:42:30,870 --> 01:42:33,896
"Sweetheart I swear on you."

1140
01:42:33,973 --> 01:42:37,170
"Sweetheart I swear on you."
- Thank you.

1141
01:42:37,243 --> 01:42:39,905
"Sweetheart I swear on you."

1142
01:42:41,748 --> 01:42:42,942
Marry me, Saru.

1143
01:42:49,055 --> 01:42:51,080
Charity marriage...

1144
01:42:52,091 --> 01:42:53,217
No, thank you.

1145
01:42:55,928 --> 01:42:57,088
Saru.

1146
01:42:58,097 --> 01:42:59,291
Saru, please.

1147
01:42:59,999 --> 01:43:01,694
It's not your responsibility...

1148
01:43:01,768 --> 01:43:02,894
...to fulfill every
incomplete story of mine, Inder.

1149
01:43:02,969 --> 01:43:03,958
Then whose is it?

1150
01:43:04,604 --> 01:43:05,901
Stop it, please.

1151
01:43:07,106 --> 01:43:10,303
I am not your first choice
Neither am I your best choice...

1152
01:43:10,576 --> 01:43:11,770
You're my only...

1153
01:43:18,050 --> 01:43:21,816
If you ask again, I'll say yes.

1154
01:43:26,092 --> 01:43:28,583
I'll stoop really low in my own view.

1155
01:43:32,732 --> 01:43:34,757
I want to die with pride...

1156
01:43:39,572 --> 01:43:41,335
Give me your hand.

1157
01:43:41,874 --> 01:43:43,205
You can't die.

1158
01:43:51,017 --> 01:43:58,014
Go always grants
parents wish for the child.

1159
01:43:59,125 --> 01:44:01,559
Putting a garland on a photo
is a curse and not a wish...

1160
01:44:01,627 --> 01:44:04,027
...and no God ever fulfils a curse.

1161
01:44:08,534 --> 01:44:09,933
Blessings or a curse...

1162
01:44:11,904 --> 01:44:14,236
Whatever the parents wish for
from their hearts...

1163
01:44:18,177 --> 01:44:19,804
...God says O.K.

1164
01:44:19,879 --> 01:44:21,608
What okay...

1165
01:44:23,249 --> 01:44:25,183
Enough, Saru.

1166
01:44:25,751 --> 01:44:26,877
Enough.

1167
01:44:28,187 --> 01:44:30,087
Let's go to the hospital.

1168
01:45:13,866 --> 01:45:15,561
Oh my... what's he doing?

1169
01:45:15,635 --> 01:45:16,624
Jayram!

1170
01:45:16,702 --> 01:45:17,600
Jayram!

1171
01:45:17,670 --> 01:45:18,659
Come quickly!

1172
01:45:18,738 --> 01:45:19,227
Jayram!

1173
01:45:21,807 --> 01:45:24,071
Rascal! What is this?

1174
01:45:24,176 --> 01:45:25,768
What hooliganism is this?

1175
01:45:26,212 --> 01:45:27,577
Call the police!

1176
01:45:43,796 --> 01:45:45,821
Stop putting a wreath on her photo.

1177
01:45:46,699 --> 01:45:49,634
Otherwise... what will you do?

1178
01:45:50,303 --> 01:45:51,895
What can you do?

1179
01:45:58,110 --> 01:46:00,135
I'll come back so
you can slap me again.

1180
01:46:03,049 --> 01:46:04,516
Goodbye.

1181
01:46:26,272 --> 01:46:27,796
Hey... buddy.

1182
01:46:28,808 --> 01:46:30,673
Wake up, its morning.

1183
01:46:32,178 --> 01:46:33,110
Come on.

1184
01:46:37,850 --> 01:46:39,750
I told you I've got my eyes on you.

1185
01:46:42,188 --> 01:46:44,019
You're the star of the society.

1186
01:46:45,224 --> 01:46:46,748
There are many complaints against you.

1187
01:46:49,295 --> 01:46:51,195
Did you drink all this alone?

1188
01:46:52,098 --> 01:46:53,190
Surprising.

1189
01:46:53,265 --> 01:46:55,665
Come on, I'll get you
some tea at the police station.

1190
01:47:00,906 --> 01:47:02,897
There's a bit of improvement.

1191
01:47:04,944 --> 01:47:06,912
I'm discharging you
only because you're asking.

1192
01:47:07,513 --> 01:47:09,504
But make sure you come
for your checkups every day.

1193
01:47:09,582 --> 01:47:10,947
Okay.

1194
01:47:12,118 --> 01:47:13,551
Where's your friend?

1195
01:47:15,521 --> 01:47:17,853
Normally he's always
here during visiting hours.

1196
01:47:18,224 --> 01:47:19,555
So what happened today?

1197
01:47:26,866 --> 01:47:28,629
Sir, please let me make a call.

1198
01:47:30,636 --> 01:47:31,660
Sir.

1199
01:47:33,839 --> 01:47:34,965
Sir, please, sir.

1200
01:48:04,637 --> 01:48:05,934
Sir, I need to call the hospital.

1201
01:48:06,005 --> 01:48:07,267
Rode, do something about him.

1202
01:48:07,606 --> 01:48:09,267
Hey... sit down?

1203
01:48:09,775 --> 01:48:11,208
You're not on a visit here.

1204
01:48:11,544 --> 01:48:12,670
Sit.

1205
01:48:15,648 --> 01:48:18,515
Let me use the phone, otherwise...
- Otherwise what?

1206
01:48:19,051 --> 01:48:20,780
Otherwise what?

1207
01:48:20,986 --> 01:48:22,817
I would've put you behind bars,
you know.

1208
01:48:24,156 --> 01:48:26,954
There are numerous complaints
against you from the society.

1209
01:48:28,594 --> 01:48:30,721
Moreover,
you also have a criminal record.

1210
01:48:33,566 --> 01:48:36,228
And now you threaten the inspector
on duty in the police station.

1211
01:48:36,569 --> 01:48:37,297
Otherwise...

1212
01:48:38,771 --> 01:48:40,170
Otherwise... you'll do what?

1213
01:48:41,674 --> 01:48:44,302
Sir... I just want to make a call.
- Rode, throw him behind bars.

1214
01:48:45,544 --> 01:48:47,603
It's Saturday,
he won't get bail until Monday.

1215
01:48:47,680 --> 01:48:49,238
Please sir,
it's a very important call.

1216
01:48:49,315 --> 01:48:50,213
Let him rot inside for a day or two.

1217
01:48:50,282 --> 01:48:52,773
Sir... sir...
- Stop bothering sir.

1218
01:48:52,852 --> 01:48:53,910
Please tell your sir...

1219
01:48:54,253 --> 01:48:55,948
Just one phone call.
Please tell him...

1220
01:48:56,021 --> 01:48:56,817
Just one call to the hospital.

1221
01:48:57,556 --> 01:48:59,183
Listen...

1222
01:49:01,961 --> 01:49:03,223
I will call.

1223
01:49:03,996 --> 01:49:05,759
Stop...

1224
01:49:06,132 --> 01:49:08,794
Who are you calling? Your father?

1225
01:49:08,934 --> 01:49:10,561
Stop...

1226
01:49:20,913 --> 01:49:21,902
Bharti, get the car.

1227
01:49:28,687 --> 01:49:30,621
I want to issue this book.

1228
01:50:02,855 --> 01:50:05,016
If someone's released
from jail after 8 years...

1229
01:50:05,090 --> 01:50:06,785
...then what should he read...

1230
01:50:10,029 --> 01:50:12,190
"Bear girl... Coffee?"

1231
01:50:27,079 --> 01:50:28,706
"No coffee?"

1232
01:50:28,948 --> 01:50:30,848
"Then how about a tequila?"

1233
01:50:57,209 --> 01:50:59,234
"Today after meeting
a girl in the lift..."

1234
01:50:59,311 --> 01:51:01,745
"...i felt like I found
the best choice of my life."

1235
01:51:02,281 --> 01:51:04,181
"I stay away from girls that cry."

1236
01:51:04,950 --> 01:51:09,216
"But when you cry...
I want to just... kiss you."

1237
01:51:09,788 --> 01:51:11,016
"So can I?"

1238
01:51:28,073 --> 01:51:30,234
"It's been 27 days and 9 hours
since I met you."

1239
01:51:30,809 --> 01:51:32,834
"But you haven't replied yet."

1240
01:51:33,646 --> 01:51:35,136
"So I guess it's a no, thank you."

1241
01:51:35,881 --> 01:51:39,681
"But... if you ever change your mind,
call me."

1242
01:52:24,263 --> 01:52:29,200
Stop.
- Wait...

1243
01:53:16,882 --> 01:53:20,147
You ran with a death wish...
To say what?

1244
01:53:20,953 --> 01:53:22,580
Sorry or I love you?

1245
01:53:34,967 --> 01:53:36,161
Wait...

1246
01:53:41,874 --> 01:53:43,774
This time he ran
off with the handcuffs.

1247
01:53:44,710 --> 01:53:46,905
What will we tell the government?
Where's the handcuffs gone?

1248
01:53:46,979 --> 01:53:48,674
Should I go after him?
- No.

1249
01:53:49,047 --> 01:53:50,173
Go order some tea.

1250
01:53:51,250 --> 01:53:53,081
He's on a 1 0 minute parole.

1251
01:53:53,218 --> 01:53:54,810
After that he goes back in again.

1252
01:53:55,254 --> 01:53:57,085
His time starts now.

1253
01:54:27,686 --> 01:54:29,586
Sorry, Saru. I am late.

1254
01:54:30,956 --> 01:54:34,084
Why are you crying? Are you okay?

1255
01:54:35,961 --> 01:54:38,122
No... you're not fine.

1256
01:54:38,197 --> 01:54:40,597
Let's go to the hospital. Come on.

1257
01:54:40,799 --> 01:54:42,164
Right now. Come.

1258
01:54:42,734 --> 01:54:44,565
You didn't tell me that
you've been discharged.

1259
01:54:44,636 --> 01:54:47,696
Even you didn't tell
me that I am your best choice.

1260
01:54:50,008 --> 01:54:52,169
You say I am your best choice.

1261
01:54:53,278 --> 01:54:56,679
Then why did you let
me marry that Abhimanyu?

1262
01:54:57,015 --> 01:54:59,313
Saru, you're my best choice, but...

1263
01:55:00,219 --> 01:55:06,158
A criminal like me can't
be your best choice... or your dad's

1264
01:55:09,962 --> 01:55:11,259
Inder...

1265
01:55:20,672 --> 01:55:23,573
You know why life was like this.

1266
01:55:26,278 --> 01:55:29,247
So that I go not as
Saraswati Parthasaarthy...

1267
01:55:30,649 --> 01:55:32,810
...but as Saraswati Parihaar

1268
01:55:42,828 --> 01:55:44,318
Marry me, Inder.

1269
01:55:45,163 --> 01:55:47,757
Please!

1270
01:56:15,227 --> 01:56:16,888
Wound Master... Parole over.

1271
01:56:16,962 --> 01:56:17,929
Time up.

1272
01:56:24,770 --> 01:56:30,731
Don't go, please... please... please...

1273
01:56:50,329 --> 01:56:52,320
Wedding gift... from me!

1274
01:57:07,079 --> 01:57:09,104
The henna looks nice, doesn't it?

1275
01:57:14,586 --> 01:57:16,110
Should I wear a sari tomorrow?

1276
01:57:20,258 --> 01:57:21,953
What are you going to wear?

1277
01:57:25,297 --> 01:57:26,958
Wear something formal.

1278
01:57:31,136 --> 01:57:35,573
It's our wedding,
our outfits should be coordinated.

1279
01:57:38,543 --> 01:57:42,809
What? Joking.

1280
01:57:45,651 --> 01:57:47,050
Inder...

1281
01:57:48,253 --> 01:57:50,118
When I am gone...

1282
01:57:52,958 --> 01:57:55,654
...please don't put
a wreath on my picture.

1283
01:58:04,770 --> 01:58:09,707
Just bury me under a beautiful tree
In my two yards of space...

1284
01:58:12,044 --> 01:58:14,205
When one of my own
comes to visit me...

1285
01:58:16,014 --> 01:58:18,175
...l'll shower down as flowers on them

1286
01:58:56,888 --> 01:58:59,083
You won't put a wreath
on her photo anymore.

1287
01:59:01,493 --> 01:59:05,520
Why does it make
such a big difference...

1288
01:59:05,597 --> 01:59:08,623
...to a useless hooligan like you?

1289
01:59:08,700 --> 01:59:12,830
Because Saru's getting
married tomorrow... to me.

1290
01:59:18,577 --> 01:59:21,637
And this time... I didn't come here to
invite you like I did the last time.

1291
01:59:22,013 --> 01:59:23,878
In fact, I'm here to tell you...

1292
01:59:23,949 --> 01:59:28,249
...when Saru sees this wreath...
she feels hurt.

1293
01:59:29,287 --> 01:59:30,777
She cries.

1294
01:59:31,590 --> 01:59:34,150
And to stop her tears,
I can kill...

1295
01:59:35,827 --> 01:59:37,260
...and die too!

1296
01:59:45,737 --> 01:59:47,227
What do you think?

1297
01:59:47,672 --> 01:59:50,197
Will I have to use this gun, or not?

1298
01:59:53,612 --> 01:59:54,738
You won't!

1299
01:59:57,549 --> 01:59:59,107
Enough now!

1300
01:59:59,251 --> 02:00:00,582
Please.

1301
02:00:01,219 --> 02:00:02,277
Enough!

1302
02:00:05,257 --> 02:00:06,690
I told him.

1303
02:00:07,793 --> 02:00:09,727
No one will put a wreath
on that photo anymore.

1304
02:00:14,166 --> 02:00:15,599
But one thing...

1305
02:00:16,935 --> 02:00:20,894
If he says no... once... just once...

1306
02:00:22,140 --> 02:00:25,576
...then our Saru won't marry you.

1307
02:00:50,235 --> 02:00:52,135
Mr. Inder... Ms. Saraswati.

1308
02:00:52,204 --> 02:00:55,105
Are you two ready for the seven vows?

1309
02:01:00,245 --> 02:01:01,177
Yes!

1310
02:01:02,180 --> 02:01:05,047
Inspector sir, they are ready.

1311
02:01:06,017 --> 02:01:09,043
Now please repeat these vows after me.

1312
02:01:11,556 --> 02:01:12,682
First vow.

1313
02:01:13,091 --> 02:01:18,188
If you do a good deed...
or go on a pilgrimage...

1314
02:01:19,130 --> 02:01:23,931
If you do a good deed...
or go on a pilgrimage...

1315
02:01:24,002 --> 02:01:26,095
...observe a fast or give charity.

1316
02:01:26,705 --> 02:01:28,104
...observe a fast or give charity.

1317
02:01:28,173 --> 02:01:30,266
Then you will do it with me.

1318
02:01:31,109 --> 02:01:32,633
Then you will do it with me.

1319
02:01:32,711 --> 02:01:36,738
If you agree... then come
reside in your left side.

1320
02:01:37,015 --> 02:01:41,952
If you agree... then come
reside in your left side.

1321
02:01:47,893 --> 02:01:49,155
I agree!

1322
02:01:51,796 --> 02:01:53,229
Good...

1323
02:01:54,332 --> 02:01:56,095
Now for the second promise.

1324
02:01:56,635 --> 02:02:00,628
The way you respect
your mother and father...

1325
02:02:02,707 --> 02:02:07,007
...similarly... you will
respect my mother and father too.

1326
02:02:08,013 --> 02:02:11,540
The way you respect
your mother and father...

1327
02:02:13,652 --> 02:02:18,055
...similarly... you will
respect my mother and father too.

1328
02:02:18,123 --> 02:02:21,615
And... according to
your family's norms...

1329
02:02:21,893 --> 02:02:25,659
...you'll perform religious
deeds and stay devoted to God.

1330
02:02:25,730 --> 02:02:29,962
If you agree...
they'll I'll reside in your left side.

1331
02:02:30,735 --> 02:02:31,326
And...

1332
02:02:31,603 --> 02:02:32,865
Wait a minute, Saru.

1333
02:02:41,246 --> 02:02:42,873
What happened?

1334
02:02:43,782 --> 02:02:45,113
Inspector...

1335
02:02:48,320 --> 02:02:50,049
I don't respect my father, Saru.

1336
02:02:54,659 --> 02:02:56,320
Saru. Saru.

1337
02:03:00,165 --> 02:03:03,066
If I make take that promise inside,
it will be a lie. Won't it?

1338
02:03:14,312 --> 02:03:16,303
And, I can't lie to you, Saru.

1339
02:03:17,048 --> 02:03:18,572
Not you.

1340
02:03:19,217 --> 02:03:20,878
Not you.

1341
02:03:31,096 --> 02:03:32,290
Sir...

1342
02:03:33,064 --> 02:03:35,726
...can we just exchange garlands
and not vows to get married?

1343
02:03:36,267 --> 02:03:38,292
Yes, of course.

1344
02:03:49,114 --> 02:03:51,275
Sir, I was expecting you much earlier.

1345
02:04:14,305 --> 02:04:16,637
I heard you're getting married.

1346
02:04:43,668 --> 02:04:47,195
Please, dad. Please...

1347
02:04:47,272 --> 02:04:49,832
Please let us get married.

1348
02:04:50,842 --> 02:04:52,104
Please.

1349
02:04:52,744 --> 02:04:54,234
Please, dad. Please...

1350
02:04:54,312 --> 02:04:56,780
Please... Please...
Please, dad.

1351
02:04:56,848 --> 02:04:58,713
Please...

1352
02:04:59,684 --> 02:05:01,811
Please let us get married.

1353
02:05:01,886 --> 02:05:03,820
Please let us get married today.

1354
02:05:03,888 --> 02:05:05,150
Please, dad.

1355
02:05:05,223 --> 02:05:10,855
Please... Please...
Please, dad.

1356
02:05:14,165 --> 02:05:16,292
What if I say No?

1357
02:05:41,059 --> 02:05:48,295
This 20/52... said to me yesterday...

1358
02:05:50,635 --> 02:05:57,871
...that he can kill
for you... and die too.

1359
02:06:11,589 --> 02:06:14,922
There's no promise
bigger than that, Saru.

1360
02:06:19,197 --> 02:06:23,224
And there's no boy better
than him for you!

1361
02:06:40,785 --> 02:06:42,753
Now you look like a bride.

1362
02:07:01,139 --> 02:07:03,073
Garland him, Saru.

1363
02:07:10,248 --> 02:07:11,840
Saru!

1364
02:07:16,821 --> 02:07:18,789
Go on, dear.

1365
02:07:19,891 --> 02:07:21,688
Garland him.

1366
02:07:55,293 --> 02:07:59,229
Congratulations.

1367
02:07:59,631 --> 02:08:01,258
Sign here.

1368
02:08:04,869 --> 02:08:05,961
Here.

1369
02:08:06,671 --> 02:08:08,070
Here...

1370
02:09:28,586 --> 02:09:30,019
Inder.

1371
02:09:33,624 --> 02:09:35,148
Saru.

1372
02:10:20,838 --> 02:10:22,601
Sir, please go.

1373
02:10:41,859 --> 02:10:43,884
Is Kaveri happy?

1374
02:10:57,041 --> 02:11:00,909
Isn't my husband
more handsome than hers?

1375
02:11:11,789 --> 02:11:13,256
Don't tell her.

1376
02:11:17,094 --> 02:11:18,789
She'll get upset.

1377
02:11:31,909 --> 02:11:34,002
Do you hate me?

1378
02:11:43,321 --> 02:11:45,915
I miss you a lot, dad.

1379
02:11:57,201 --> 02:12:01,297
Nice to see the whole family here.
Congratulations, on your wedding.

1380
02:12:02,306 --> 02:12:07,608
Doctor, we still have
to give Saru's reception party.

1381
02:12:08,145 --> 02:12:10,045
When can she go home?

1382
02:12:10,581 --> 02:12:13,243
We've to invite our
family from all over India.

1383
02:12:14,318 --> 02:12:17,014
And her sister, she's in the US.

1384
02:12:17,088 --> 02:12:18,953
We've to invite her as well.

1385
02:12:19,223 --> 02:12:21,191
All this takes time.

1386
02:12:25,730 --> 02:12:27,721
How much time do I have, doctor?

1387
02:12:39,277 --> 02:12:42,246
At least until my henna fades out...

1388
02:12:57,328 --> 02:12:58,795
Excuse me!

1389
02:13:23,120 --> 02:13:28,114
I said... lets perform final rites.

1390
02:13:29,694 --> 02:13:33,130
What kind of a father
says that for his child?

1391
02:13:38,169 --> 02:13:40,899
Whether a parent gives
a blessing and curse...

1392
02:13:40,972 --> 02:13:43,770
...God fulfils all of it.

1393
02:13:44,575 --> 02:13:46,133
You said that...

1394
02:13:47,078 --> 02:13:48,807
But I didn't listen.

1395
02:13:54,118 --> 02:13:58,680
I thought... she will come back,
say sorry.

1396
02:13:58,756 --> 02:14:00,986
And I will forgive her.

1397
02:14:08,065 --> 02:14:09,794
Dad...

1398
02:14:15,006 --> 02:14:16,200
Dad...

1399
02:14:39,997 --> 02:14:42,227
Can I get some sacred ashes?

1400
02:15:04,121 --> 02:15:09,184
A very intelligent man once told me.

1401
02:15:15,566 --> 02:15:17,761
If things go your way, it's good.

1402
02:15:22,673 --> 02:15:24,834
If it doesn't, it's even better.

1403
02:15:27,611 --> 02:15:30,102
Because it's the will of God.

1404
02:15:51,035 --> 02:15:54,027
Enough! Enough! Enough!

1405
02:16:01,879 --> 02:16:04,074
She left this purse... at the court.

1406
02:16:06,751 --> 02:16:09,686
I even found this book in it.

1407
02:16:13,557 --> 02:16:20,121
She was issuing this book
for the past three months.

1408
02:16:20,598 --> 02:16:21,997
Do you know why?

1409
02:16:22,733 --> 02:16:23,665
No!

1410
02:16:26,971 --> 02:16:30,304
There's a dried rose on page no .65.

1411
02:16:32,777 --> 02:16:35,075
Maybe... as a bookmark.

1412
02:16:37,014 --> 02:16:40,780
And there's a date written
on the on page no .65.

1413
02:16:42,887 --> 02:16:46,550
1 994 to 201 5.

1414
02:16:49,226 --> 02:16:51,922
What... what does this mean?

1415
02:16:52,963 --> 02:16:54,294
What does this mean?

1416
02:16:54,999 --> 02:16:59,299
Page no .65 has your photo
as well as your fathers.

1417
02:17:01,138 --> 02:17:05,097
Think... whose destination
is page no. 65.

1418
02:17:05,176 --> 02:17:06,803
Think.

1419
02:17:17,121 --> 02:17:18,145
Sir...

1420
02:17:25,830 --> 02:17:27,229
Sit, Inder.

1421
02:17:33,170 --> 02:17:35,297
Is that tree still in the garden?

1422
02:17:36,140 --> 02:17:37,732
The one from 1 858?

1423
02:17:37,808 --> 02:17:38,866
Yes.

1424
02:17:40,544 --> 02:17:42,842
I want 2 yards of
land under that tree.

1425
02:17:42,913 --> 02:17:45,211
Can I ask why?
- I just want it.

1426
02:17:46,016 --> 02:17:48,075
Who did you kill this time?

1427
02:17:53,123 --> 02:17:55,717
There are blood stains on your shirt.

1428
02:17:56,660 --> 02:17:58,890
Don't I have the right to ask you?

1429
02:17:58,963 --> 02:18:00,123
Inder.

1430
02:18:01,131 --> 02:18:04,123
You haven't stopped turning
your back and running away.

1431
02:18:04,668 --> 02:18:06,067
I learnt it from you.

1432
02:18:35,199 --> 02:18:36,723
Saru, before our wedding...

1433
02:18:36,834 --> 02:18:39,598
...you never asked why
I committed that murder.

1434
02:18:43,741 --> 02:18:46,642
Because you must have killed
someone in order to save someone.

1435
02:18:53,951 --> 02:18:56,613
When I was 1 3, I had a nanny.
Ms. Lily.

1436
02:18:57,321 --> 02:18:59,050
I considered her as a mother.

1437
02:19:01,592 --> 02:19:04,083
One day my uncle barged
in her room and...

1438
02:19:05,863 --> 02:19:11,130
In order to save herself,
she killed my uncle.

1439
02:19:14,538 --> 02:19:17,598
I knew dad would never
believe her, so...

1440
02:19:18,042 --> 02:19:20,203
...I said that I killed him.

1441
02:19:22,813 --> 02:19:25,873
The biggest criminal
lawyer of the country.

1442
02:19:27,084 --> 02:19:30,247
My dad refused to take my case.

1443
02:19:36,927 --> 02:19:38,952
He abondoned me.

1444
02:19:40,197 --> 02:19:42,165
I can never forget that.

1445
02:19:49,206 --> 02:19:50,901
Inder...

1446
02:19:54,111 --> 02:19:58,741
...people don't stay
together because they forget.

1447
02:20:00,217 --> 02:20:05,120
People stay together
because they forgive.

1448
02:20:07,891 --> 02:20:09,722
I can never forgive him.

1449
02:20:28,712 --> 02:20:30,077
Promise?

1450
02:20:41,992 --> 02:20:43,220
Inder.

1451
02:20:45,329 --> 02:20:46,887
Come closer.

1452
02:21:04,948 --> 02:21:06,813
Now say bye.

1453
02:21:08,285 --> 02:21:09,718
Never.

1454
02:21:15,859 --> 02:21:18,293
If you don't give
permission to your wife...

1455
02:21:18,562 --> 02:21:20,086
...how can she go?

1456
02:21:23,834 --> 02:21:25,096
You can't go.

1457
02:21:32,109 --> 02:21:34,737
When it's your turn to go...

1458
02:21:37,815 --> 02:21:40,113
...then I'll come see you first.

1459
02:21:43,587 --> 02:21:45,282
With henna on my hands.

1460
02:21:54,598 --> 02:21:56,190
Now say bye.

1461
02:21:59,369 --> 02:22:00,734
You can't go.

1462
02:22:03,841 --> 02:22:05,775
It's your parent's prayers.

1463
02:22:08,011 --> 02:22:09,308
Isn't that what you said?

1464
02:22:18,589 --> 02:22:20,216
He has answered their prayers.

1465
02:22:24,161 --> 02:22:25,685
I found you.

1466
02:22:31,135 --> 02:22:33,296
God's personal love-letter.

1467
02:22:43,080 --> 02:22:45,275
I've read the love-letter.

1468
02:22:47,684 --> 02:22:49,345
Now I am not scared to go.

1469
02:22:56,026 --> 02:22:57,755
I love you!

1470
02:23:05,936 --> 02:23:07,836
I love you!

1471
02:23:11,074 --> 02:23:16,011
To the square of infinity.

1472
02:24:25,916 --> 02:24:27,144
Saru...

1473
02:25:52,736 --> 02:25:54,328
I heard you got married.

1474
02:25:57,074 --> 02:25:58,166
Inder...

1475
02:25:59,810 --> 02:26:02,244
...who asks for 2 yards of land
to be buried in for their wedding?

1476
02:26:07,751 --> 02:26:09,514
She'll be fine.

1477
02:26:13,190 --> 02:26:15,681
I couldn't save you once...

1478
02:26:16,727 --> 02:26:21,096
...and that was the
biggest mistake of my life.

1479
02:26:23,834 --> 02:26:28,533
This time...
I will save my daughter-in-law.

1480
02:26:31,041 --> 02:26:33,236
I... will use every power...
- Saru's no more.

1481
02:26:36,813 --> 02:26:37,871
No more.

1482
02:27:05,242 --> 02:27:11,909
Sir... Sir... Papa!

1483
02:27:16,753 --> 02:27:18,846
Save your tears, papa.

1484
02:27:20,190 --> 02:27:22,954
She's so beautiful that,
when you see her...

1485
02:27:24,194 --> 02:27:26,662
...you won't be able
to hold back your tears.

1486
02:27:32,803 --> 02:27:34,566
Will you let me meet her?

1487
02:27:39,643 --> 02:27:43,272
Will you forget my mistakes?

1488
02:27:45,282 --> 02:27:48,877
People don't stay together
because they forget.

1489
02:27:49,286 --> 02:27:53,655
People stay together because
they forgive each other.

1490
02:28:19,683 --> 02:28:20,581
Thank you...

1491
02:28:23,186 --> 02:28:25,245
So you're happy with your
husband's achievements!

1492
02:28:27,958 --> 02:28:29,118
So let's celebrate.

1493
02:28:30,827 --> 02:28:32,522
Cheers.

1494
02:28:35,899 --> 02:28:38,959
I quit drinking. I swear.

1495
02:28:41,004 --> 02:28:44,997
Just once or twice a year...
I try it to... to remember the taste.

1496
02:28:50,280 --> 02:28:51,611
I miss you.

1497
02:28:55,318 --> 02:28:56,751
I do... every day.

1498
02:28:59,155 --> 02:29:00,554
Miss you a lot.

1499
02:29:03,493 --> 02:29:04,585
I swear.

1500
02:29:04,728 --> 02:29:10,963
"Without you... it's impossible to live."

1501
02:29:11,034 --> 02:29:17,564
"You're the only one I prayed for."

1502
02:29:17,641 --> 02:29:23,238
"Your absence is like a curse."

1503
02:29:23,880 --> 02:29:30,080
"If you go away... I will die."

1504
02:29:30,153 --> 02:29:33,520
"Sweetheart I swear on you."

1505
02:29:33,590 --> 02:29:36,684
"Sweetheart I swear on you."

1506
02:29:36,760 --> 02:29:39,991
"Sweetheart I swear on you."

1507
02:29:41,565 --> 02:29:42,657
Are you sorry?

1508
02:29:42,732 --> 02:29:43,790
Then say you're sorry.

1509
02:29:45,068 --> 02:29:48,128
If you ask again, I'll say yes.

1510
02:29:48,939 --> 02:29:52,932
If you agree... then come
reside in your left side.

1511
02:30:15,131 --> 02:30:21,627
"My heart's only loved you."

1512
02:30:21,705 --> 02:30:27,905
"You're the only one I prayed for."

1513
02:30:27,978 --> 02:30:32,915
"Your absence is like a curse."

1514
02:30:34,284 --> 02:30:39,881
"Your absence is like a curse."

1515
02:30:40,824 --> 02:30:47,024
"If you go away... I will die."

1516
02:30:47,097 --> 02:30:50,191
"Sweetheart I swear on you."

1517
02:30:50,266 --> 02:30:53,599
"Sweetheart I swear on you."

1518
02:30:53,670 --> 02:30:57,265
"Sweetheart I swear on you."

1519
02:30:57,340 --> 02:31:03,006
"Every time I see you,
my eyes get wet with tears."

1520
02:31:03,079 --> 02:31:06,139
"Sweetheart I swear on you."

1521
02:31:06,216 --> 02:31:09,549
"Sweetheart I swear on you."

1522
02:31:09,619 --> 02:31:13,111
"Sweetheart I swear on you."

1523
02:32:00,770 --> 02:32:07,039
"You're the only one I prayed for."

1524
02:32:07,110 --> 02:32:13,174
"Your absence is like a curse."

1525
02:32:13,249 --> 02:32:19,813
"If you go away... I will die."

1526
02:32:19,889 --> 02:32:23,052
"Sweetheart I swear on you."

1527
02:32:23,126 --> 02:32:26,186
"Sweetheart I swear on you."

1528
02:32:26,262 --> 02:32:29,789
"Sweetheart I swear on you."

1529
02:32:43,079 --> 02:32:49,712
"My heart's... addicted to you."

1530
02:32:49,786 --> 02:32:55,588
"Don't ever... betray me."

1531
02:32:55,658 --> 02:33:01,563
"I am used to you... it's not my fault."

1532
02:33:01,631 --> 02:33:07,763
"Without you... it's impossible to live."

1533
02:33:07,837 --> 02:33:14,208
"You're the only one I prayed for."

1534
02:33:14,277 --> 02:33:20,079
"Your absence is like a curse."

1535
02:33:20,750 --> 02:33:26,916
"If you go away... I will die."

1536
02:33:26,990 --> 02:33:30,153
"Sweetheart I swear on you."

1537
02:33:30,226 --> 02:33:33,320
"Sweetheart I swear on you."

1538
02:33:33,596 --> 02:33:37,692
"Sweetheart I swear on you."
