and understand him well right then.

47
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,500
'I don't like even
one of the boys whom

48
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:33,750
my family is considering for me.'

49
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,708
'Maybe that is
because there is no love.'

Okay, mother, I cannot see that you

67
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:37,875
are happy because I am coming, mother.

68
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:39,500
How can I show my happiness? Tell me.

69
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:41,291
Should I take the
priest to the bus stand?

70
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:42,625
Should I get you married you there?
- Hey!

71
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,958
Mother..
- What should I cook? Tell me.

72

Give me one kilogram of mangoes.

'Bus number 8 has come. Come aboard.'

80
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:31,208

00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:03,916
Hey, uncle. Listen..

171
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:10,208
Move, I want to go in.

172
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:14,333
Are you speaking the truth..
- Yes. Absolutely.

173
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:16,375
Trust me. She said that to me.

174
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:19,958
Hey, give one to me..
- Hey, wait, I am giving it to you.

175
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:27,000
Don't even ask how bad it was..
- Yes, that was a huge blow.

176
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:31,416
Everyone says so.. - Brother,
can you please move a little?

177
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:35,583
Now when she said that, I felt
so bad that.. - Hello, mother.

178
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:38,625
No, actually, I was busy
with my phone at that time.

179
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:39,958
That is why..

180
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:42,375
Is this the time to make your
friend fall into trouble, friend?

181
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:44,958
This is the time to
support your friend.

182
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:49,291
And when they said about the office..
- Yes. I know.

183
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:50,583
Look at this. This is so good..
- Yes.

184
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,541
Yes.

185
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:54,666
Thank you, thank you.

186
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,500
Oh no.

187
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:06,791
Hey!

188
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,625
I have been watching you
since the very beginning.

189
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:09,875
Since the time you
have taken the bus..

190
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:11,333
..you have kept on leaving your seat.

191
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:13,583
Like this, if you keep
on leaving your seat,

192
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:15,833
you wouldn't be able
to get your seat, dear.

193
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:18,250
And then she said.. - You will
get place. Right at the top.

194
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,458
Hey, bus.

195
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:25,791
Hey, bus.

196
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:27,125
Hey, stop.

197
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:28,625
Hey, stop.

198
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:29,583
Hey, bus.

199
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:31,250
I want to go.
- Hey, come quickly.

200
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:32,833
Come quickly. Come quickly.
Come quickly.

201
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:35,458
Get up. Come on, come on.

202
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:36,583
Hey, move, move, move. Give way.

203
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:37,791
Come on, take to the left.
To the left. To the left.

204
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:39,375
Hey, move, move, move. Give way.

205
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:40,791
Come on, take to the left.
To the left. To the left.

206
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:44,625
Come on, come on.
- Come here. Come here. Come here.

207
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,375
Move it, come on, take it the left..

208
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:47,875
Come here, come here,
come here, come here.

209
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:52,541
Come on, come on. Dhakuri, Barashat,
Kolkata. Kolkata.

210
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:06,875
Ticket.

211
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:10,291
"Indulge in some romance."

212
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,833
"The sleep of the eyes goes away."

213
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:15,083
Where do you want to go?

214
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:16,541
What?
- What are you saying?

215
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:17,833
Where do you want to go?
- "When love strikes."

216
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,583
I see.
- "The sleep of the eyes goes away."

217
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:20,833
Where do you want to go?

218
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,500
"In this feeling of love."

219
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:23,166
Even I..

220
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,458
I want to go to Dharmatala.

221
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,208
"Indulge in some romance.."
- And you?

222
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:27,000
Ranaghat.

223
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:29,708
Brother, come here. "Mad one."

224
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:30,958
You can go and sit there.

225
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,541
"Indulge in some.."
- Go and sit there.

226
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:34,291
"Romance."
- Take this. Take the change.

227
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:36,666
"Mad one."
- Brother, your ticket.

228
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:39,833
Yours. Yours.
- "Indulge in some romance."

229
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:44,458
Brother, want to sit here?
You will get the breeze.

230
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:46,166
"A little bit loud enough.
A little bit loud enough."

231
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:49,458
Come on.
- "DJ, turn it down."

232
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:51,083
Your ticket?

233
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,041
Brother, give me change.
Give me change.

234
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,791
Brother, ticket?

235
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:58,291
Where do you want to go?

236
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,000
Two tickets for
Murshidabad and Shibpur.

237
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:00,833
What is it, brother?

238
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:02,875
I have been shouting for so
long and made my voice hoarse.

239
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:04,250
It wouldn't halt at
Shibpur or anywhere.

240
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:05,375
It will go straight to Behrampor.

241
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:06,416
You can get down there.

242
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,791
Or else, you can get
down at Palsan. Take this.

243
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:10,666
Today's trip is fun..
- Yes, it is.

244
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,416
Come on, give me way, give way.

245
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,416
Have you taken ticket?
- Yes, I have.

246
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:14,208
You?
- Yes, I have.

247
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,333
You? All of you?

248
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:16,291
Yes, it is done.
- You? You have taken it?

249
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:17,125
Yes, it has been done.

250
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:18,125
Ticket.

251
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:20,250
Murshidabad and Shibpur. One way.

252
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,916
What is it, mister? Should I
hang a sign board outside now?

253
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,958
It wouldn't halt at Shibpur.
- What?

254
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:24,833
It will go straight to Behrampore.

255
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:26,291
And what about the ones
who get down in between?

256
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:28,625
Where will they go? - Get down
at Behrampore and take a bus.

257
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:29,833
Or else, get down at Palsan.

258
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:33,791
Till the time I don't get a bus,
keep waiting with your bus.

259
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:35,750
Listen, it wouldn't stop
at Shibpur or anything.

260
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:36,916
Got it?

261
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,541
And if you want to go that way,
you should travel by your own car.

262
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:41,916
Oh no, he is chief of our village.

263
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,833
Yes, yes, I will travel
by my own car next time.

264
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,875
Okay, get down at
Behrampore this time.

265
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:48,750
Yes.

266
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:51,750
Give me your ticket.

267
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:53,083
I don't know the lyrics further..
- Where?

268
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,125
Kolkata. One.

269
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,791
It is fully empty, it is fully empty.
- Listen.

270
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,625
Yes?
- Can't you take the next bus?

271
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:07,083
I have missed four buses in
a row. Now I will get late.

272
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:09,083
What? What? Hey, brother. I want
to get down, I want to get down.

273
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:10,791
Brother, I want to get down.
- Hey, where do you want to get down?

274
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,250
Hey, it is Berhampore.
Should I not get down?

275
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,291
Hey, it is just Jagoli. Sit down.

276
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:14,958
It will fill up now..
- What?

277
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:15,916
Yes. Sit down.

278
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,958
Get up, get up, get up,
Berhrampore. Balaighat. - Sit down.

279
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:18,875
Sit down, sit down..
- Come on, come on.

280
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,000
I am late. Bye.

281
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:21,041
Make it quick. Make it quick.
- Okay.

282
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:22,375
Now..

283
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:24,000
Go safely.

284
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:26,833
Yes, I will.. - Give my
greetings to father and mother.

285
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:29,416
Okay, ride the scooter safely.

286
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:30,500
Okay.

287
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:34,125
Listen. I am saying, take
this side's seat. - This one?

288
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:35,791
Yes, yes. Yes, sit on this seat.

289
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,125
Yes.
- Call me.

290
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:38,083
Okay.

291
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:39,041
Give it.

292
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:41,583
Hey, you will give it, right?

293
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:42,750
I am getting late.

294
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:44,208
Babughat. Babughat.
- Here?

295
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:46,333
Come on, come on.

00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:49,041
Hey, come on, get up on the bus..

00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:50,083
Yes.

298
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,291
Bye.
- Bye.

299
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:55,083
Come on, come on, come on.

300
00:14:57,708 --> 00:14:58,750
Go safely.
- Yes.

301
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:00,458
Hey, there is food
in the bag. Have it.

302
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:01,791
Yes, you..
- Okay.

303
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:03,583
Hey..
- Hey, what are you doing?

304
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:04,625
Hey, I will go too, I will go too..
- Careful.

305
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:05,708
Wait, wait.

306
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:12,916
What happened? Why did you come?

307
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,708
Don't you have meeting in the office?

308
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:16,333
I do have it.

309
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:21,208
Let me stay with you for some time.
I will get down at the next stop.

310
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:26,416
'We left Kolkata behind. But
I can only think of Kolkata.'

311
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,083
'And when I think of Kolkata,
I can only think of him.'

312
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:34,708
'Sometimes, some people in our
lives become very important.'

313
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:36,916
'They cannot be forgotten.

314
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,083
There are some days in life that

315
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:39,666
remain memorable for the entire life.'

316
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:41,416
'It was a day like that.

317
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:44,458
When I had gone to
Kolkata for the first time.'

318
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:53,625
Madam, where do you want to go?

319
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:55,750
Come on, if you pay
me rupees 20 extra..

320
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:57,291
..I will drop you
wherever you want me to.

321
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:00,458
Good.

322
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,291
'The number you are trying
to reach at the moment..'

323
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:17,208
'..is currently out of
reach at this moment.'

324
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:56,541
When is the next bus for Balurghat?

325
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:58,666
10.30.
- 10.30?

326
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:20,416
Hello?
- Sister, this is Joi here.

327
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:22,958
I have been calling you since dawn.

328
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:24,208
I wasn't getting through.

329
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,416
Thank you. Yes, Joi?

330
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,541
Dear, listen, I am in the
hospital since last night.

331
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:31,666
My father-in-law had
a stroke last night.

332
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,583
But look, I am not
getting proper network here.

333
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:36,791
I see. How is he now?

334
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:37,625
He is a little better.

335
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:38,416
Where are you?

336
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,458
I am..

337
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:40,166
Here at..

338
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:41,083
I am at the bus stand.

339
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:42,125
At Dharmatala.

340
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:44,583
Listen, I cannot come to pick you up.

341
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:47,208
But just listen to my
directions and come.

342
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:48,000
Okay.

343
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:51,333
Listen, when you come out of there,
you will come out on the big road.

344
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:54,250
But yes, walk on the footpath.
Don't walk on the road.

345
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:55,791
It is a very busy street.

346
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:58,375
Look ahead. When you come ahead,
there is a sweets shop of Kishidas.

347
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:00,791
On the other side of that,
there is Tipu Sultan mosque.

348
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:02,666
In front of that mosque, you will

349
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,583
get a direct bus that
goes to Sector Five.

350
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,333
Get up on the bus and say SDF.

351
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:07,291
Okay?

352
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:10,541
Get down at SDF and you will
see a lane on the left side.

353
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:13,166
Enter the lane and ask
for Millennium city.

354
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:14,708
What is it? Did you understand?

355
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,833
No.

356
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:18,375
I couldn't understand anything.

357
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:21,666
Is there someone close by? Give
the phone to him. I will tell him.

358
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:23,000
What?

359
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:24,500
Now..

360
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:28,416
Uncle. On the phone. It is my sister.

361
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,916
Can you please talk to her?
She will give an address.

362
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,541
I don't understand anything.

363
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:34,500
Even I have come to
Kolkata for the first time, dear.

364
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:35,833
My son will come to take me.

365
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:39,458
That is why I am sitting here.
- I see. Okay.

366
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:43,875
Hello, sister.
- Yes.

367
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:45,333
He is not a person from Kolkata.

368
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:46,833
Hey, check if there is
someone else around.

369
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:47,833
Okay.

370
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,750
Hey, listen. Just ask
mother to keep my food ready.

371
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:57,708
I will come back home
and leave immediately.

372
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:00,041
Hey, I have seen your
husband off in the bus.

373
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:01,458
Why are you getting so worried?

374
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:03,500
Yes.

375
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:05,291
Hey, don't act coy now.

376
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:06,541
Yes, I am hanging up now.

377
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,125
This is the first time
I have come to Kolkata.

378
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,541
Yes.

379
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,916
Can you help me?

380
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,166
What is it?

381
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:22,291
My sister.

382
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:26,000
She is on the phone. She
will tell you an address.

383
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:27,208
Can you just listen to
it and explain it to me?

384
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,791
I can't understand.

385
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:31,375
Please come with me.

386
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:35,250
Hello.
- Hello.

387
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:37,833
My name is Sudeepa. She
is my uncle's daughter.

388
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:40,666
Actually she has come to
Kolkata for an interview.

389
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,625
She doesn't know
anything about Kolkata.

390
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:45,041
Actually I was supposed
to come to pick her up.

391
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:47,625
But all of a sudden, my
father-in-law had a stroke.

392
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,208
That is why I cannot
come to pick her up.

393
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:52,625
If you could kindly help her
to take the bus to Sector 5..

394
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:53,625
What?

395
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:55,666
Look, I..

396
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:56,791
I am already late.

397
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:59,583
I had come for some work.
I don't think I can help.

398
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:01,666
Please. She doesn't know
anything about Kolkata.

399
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,375
She had a small job in the village.

400
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:05,083
She is a very good student.
- Okay.

401
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:05,750
I..

402
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:07,291
I will see.
- Thank you.

403
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:08,750
Can you give the phone to her again?

404
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,083
She wants to speak to you.
- What?

405
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:11,208
Yes.

406
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:13,250
Hello.
- I have told him.

407
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:14,500
He will help you to take the bus.

408
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:17,250
And after the interview
is over, give me a call.

409
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:18,166
Yes.

410
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,208
Go now, all the best.

411
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,041
Yes.

412
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:25,250
Dear Lord, thank you
so much. Bless me.

413
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:42,791
'You will come to the big
street after coming out of there.'

414
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,583
'But yes, walk on the footpath

415
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:46,875
and don't come on the road
as the road is very busy.'

416
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:47,791
'When you come ahead,

417
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:49,625
you will see the sweets shop
of K.C. Das a little ahead.'

418
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:50,583
On the other side, there is mono mail.

419
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:52,250
And on the right side, there
is the Tipu Sultan monument.'

420
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:55,625
'Take the Sector five bus in
front of K. C. Das's shop.'

421
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:05,125
That is your bus. It is here.

422
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:07,625
Hey!
- Yes?

423
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:10,000
Your bus is here.
- I see.

424
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:13,166
Come on, come on, come on.

425
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:15,125
Thank you.

426
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:17,791
Hey, come on.

427
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:32,333
I want to get down.
Stop. I want to get down.

428
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:35,708
Hey, what is this? What happened?

429
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:36,916
Yes?

430
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:38,916
Can you please come with me?
- What?

431
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,208
I am feeling very scared.

432
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:41,750
What is the need to feel
scared in the daytime?

433
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:44,625
That man in the bus..

434
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:45,833
Please come with me.

435
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:48,291
You could have told the conductor.

436
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,500
He would have dropped
you at the right place.

437
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:51,666
I am feeling very strange.

438
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,833
Listen, this is your city.
Please help me a bit.

439
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:58,666
Even I will help you if
you come to my Balughat.

440
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:02,166
Just decide on the way you
will go. Balughat indeed!

441
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:03,208
The service of the bus isn't good.

442
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:04,416
I don't know when it will come next.

443
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:06,583
I have my interview..

444
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:09,708
Wait. I will check.

445
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:13,083
Come on, get up.

446
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:17,416
You..
- What?

447
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:18,791
Go and sit there.

448
00:22:28,333 --> 00:22:29,166
Ticket.

449
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:36,083
Ticket.

450
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:38,375
2 for Four. She will give the fare.

451
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:58,500
Come here. We have to get down.

452
00:23:01,416 --> 00:23:02,916
Are we here at Sector 5?

453
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,666
No, this is Sealdah.

454
00:23:07,541 --> 00:23:08,541
What happened? Come on.

455
00:23:08,625 --> 00:23:10,083
Why should I get down at Sealdah?

456
00:23:11,875 --> 00:23:13,541
Because we are going by
break journey. Come on.

457
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:15,416
We have to get down.
- What do you mean by break journey?

458
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:16,208
You..

459
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:17,541
Where are you taking me?

460
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:20,041
We are going to the place
where you are supposed to go.

461
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:21,250
We will go via a longer
route but we will reach quickly.

462
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:22,166
Why? Why? You..

463
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:24,041
Why aren't you following my
sister's instructions and taking me?

464
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:26,500
Just tell me quickly,
where are you taking me?

465
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:28,250
Oh no, keep sitting here.

466
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:29,625
Just get down wherever the tram stops.

467
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:31,000
I am not responsible. I am leaving.

468
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,583
Does this go to sector 5?

469
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:37,958
No, it won't go to sector 5.

470
00:23:43,875 --> 00:23:45,000
Come on.

471
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:51,375
Hey, does this belong
to your father or what?

472
00:23:51,458 --> 00:23:52,125
I have been giving for so long.

473
00:23:52,208 --> 00:23:53,333
Now I wouldn't give a penny more.

474
00:23:53,416 --> 00:23:56,416
Why are you staring at the street?
- What?

475
00:24:00,666 --> 00:24:01,875
Sorry.

476
00:24:01,958 --> 00:24:02,916
Okay.

477
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,083
Come on, we have to take an
auto for Belaghat from that side.

478
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:07,083
Hello.
- Yes.

479
00:24:07,166 --> 00:24:08,041
Come quickly.

480
00:24:08,958 --> 00:24:10,000
By the way, what is your name?

481
00:24:10,083 --> 00:24:11,416
I cannot address you
as hello repeatedly.

482
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:15,041
Look, don't ask me anything.
You and I have met on the street.

483
00:24:15,166 --> 00:24:17,916
That is why don't ask me
anything about myself.

484
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:19,458
And I wouldn't tell
you anything. -What?

485
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:21,000
Even I wouldn't ask you anything.

486
00:24:23,333 --> 00:24:25,666
No, I have read in the newspapers.

487
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:28,333
Unknown boys of the city
steal women and sell them off.

488
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:30,666
What?
- I didn't say that to you.

489
00:24:31,208 --> 00:24:32,166
But..

490
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:33,375
It does happen, right?

491
00:24:55,125 --> 00:24:55,958
What happened?

492
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,875
What?

493
00:24:56,958 --> 00:24:58,291
Why did you stop there again?

494
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:00,791
What? Are you afraid
of getting sold off?

495
00:25:02,583 --> 00:25:03,583
Come on.

496
00:25:09,458 --> 00:25:11,208
"All the days have been so sad.."

497
00:25:11,291 --> 00:25:13,875
Hello Paresh. Hey, I
have been calling Paresh

498
00:25:13,958 --> 00:25:15,125
and his phone is going on ringing.

499
00:25:15,208 --> 00:25:16,375
"When the traveler comes.."

500
00:25:16,416 --> 00:25:17,416
I see. He is in a meeting.

501
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,875
Even I thought the same.

502
00:25:18,916 --> 00:25:20,458
Listen, do something for me please.

503
00:25:20,625 --> 00:25:23,291
Just tell Sapan that I will
get late for office today.

504
00:25:23,333 --> 00:25:24,583
And then she said that..

505
00:25:24,666 --> 00:25:26,041
Hey, no, I am feeling unwell.

506
00:25:26,875 --> 00:25:28,125
Since last night..

507
00:25:28,208 --> 00:25:29,125
..my stomach has been aching a lot.

508
00:25:29,166 --> 00:25:30,750
Hey, maybe I had something wrong.

509
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:32,333
Yes.

510
00:25:32,625 --> 00:25:34,583
I have done it around 5
to 6 times since morning.

511
00:25:35,958 --> 00:25:37,333
I am going to the doctor.

512
00:25:38,208 --> 00:25:40,791
Hey, please, you tell him. I will
come to the office in the second half.

513
00:25:40,875 --> 00:25:42,125
Yes. Okay. Bye.

514
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:46,916
"Yes, my heart says that when we.."

515
00:25:47,041 --> 00:25:47,666
Hello, sister.

516
00:25:47,708 --> 00:25:49,041
Tell mother that I will get late.

517
00:25:49,625 --> 00:25:53,250
Okay, just tell her. Okay,
come on, I am hanging up.

518
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,833
Thanks.

519
00:25:55,583 --> 00:25:56,875
I need to make a call.

520
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:00,708
No.

521
00:26:03,291 --> 00:26:04,083
I have call from the booth.

522
00:26:04,166 --> 00:26:05,708
Hello. Hey! Hey!

523
00:26:05,791 --> 00:26:06,708
Hey..

524
00:26:13,833 --> 00:26:14,500
Hello?

525
00:26:14,583 --> 00:26:16,250
This is Joi.
- Yes. Tell me.

526
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:17,458
Have you reached?

527
00:26:17,458 --> 00:26:18,791
No, I am mid way.

528
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,083
Thank God the boy came with me.

529
00:26:21,208 --> 00:26:23,041
He is still with you?

530
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:26,250
Actually I couldn't
understand anything on the way.

531
00:26:27,458 --> 00:26:29,416
That is why I got him with me.

532
00:26:29,458 --> 00:26:31,583
But even he must have some work.

533
00:26:31,625 --> 00:26:33,250
And most importantly,

534
00:26:33,375 --> 00:26:35,625
these days one can never
say anything about anyone.

535
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:38,416
One minute.

536
00:26:38,666 --> 00:26:40,458
Yes, that is the
reason I have called you.

537
00:26:40,666 --> 00:26:44,416
Listen, I will give you
the description of the boy.

538
00:26:44,458 --> 00:26:47,375
Just listen to it properly and
tell me if the boy is good or bad.

539
00:26:47,416 --> 00:26:49,833
Oh no, okay, tell me.
- Yes.

540
00:26:51,125 --> 00:26:53,375
He is over 6 feet tall. Lean physique.

541
00:26:53,875 --> 00:26:57,000
There is a mark of a scar on
the cheek like the Assamese.

542
00:26:57,041 --> 00:26:58,791
He looks a little doubtful.

543
00:26:59,208 --> 00:27:01,875
He has a strange way of talking.
I don't understand.

544
00:27:01,916 --> 00:27:02,833
I mean..

545
00:27:04,291 --> 00:27:05,750
He doesn't talk much.

546
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:06,833
Yes..

547
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:07,875
Yes and..

548
00:27:08,791 --> 00:27:10,750
And yes, he lies.

549
00:27:11,666 --> 00:27:13,916
He told a lie to someone
because he was getting late.

550
00:27:14,041 --> 00:27:15,791
But he said that because of you.

551
00:27:15,875 --> 00:27:17,416
Just tell me if he is good or bad.

552
00:27:17,458 --> 00:27:20,583
I think he is good but take care.

553
00:27:20,666 --> 00:27:23,000
But listen, call me if you need me.
- Okay.

554
00:27:23,083 --> 00:27:24,416
Yes.
- And take care.

555
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,875
Okay, fine.

556
00:27:26,791 --> 00:27:28,125
Hello, hello. I am hanging up. Okay?

557
00:27:28,166 --> 00:27:28,875
I am hanging up.

558
00:27:28,958 --> 00:27:32,458
'These services have been
specially made for your convenience.'

559
00:27:32,583 --> 00:27:34,166
'Please be careful and support us.'

560
00:27:34,291 --> 00:27:35,000
Will you go?

561
00:27:35,041 --> 00:27:37,916
'Pedestrians, please pay attention.'

562
00:27:37,958 --> 00:27:41,125
'Till the time, the
lights don't turn green..'

563
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:43,125
'..don't cross the road.'

564
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:46,166
'Remember, someone is
waiting for you at home.'

565
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:47,250
I am sitting in front.

566
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:48,291
'For your kind attention..'

567
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:49,375
Hey, side please.

568
00:27:49,541 --> 00:27:54,375
'Please do not cross the road
till the lights don't turn green.'

569
00:27:54,416 --> 00:27:59,250
'Remember, someone is
waiting for you at home.'

570
00:28:10,458 --> 00:28:11,583
Stop the auto.

571
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:13,416
I want to get down.

572
00:28:13,666 --> 00:28:14,750
Hey!

573
00:28:14,833 --> 00:28:16,041
Stop the auto.

574
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:18,208
Stop the auto.
- Hey, this is such a big trouble.

575
00:28:18,333 --> 00:28:19,500
What happened?

576
00:28:22,791 --> 00:28:24,000
How much is it?
- What happened? Why did you get down?

577
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,666
How much is it?
- I am paying it.

578
00:28:27,583 --> 00:28:29,375
10, right? Go.

579
00:28:31,708 --> 00:28:32,833
What is the problem?

580
00:28:33,375 --> 00:28:34,500
I won't go in this auto.

581
00:28:34,666 --> 00:28:37,041
What is the problem with the auto?
- Those two men..

582
00:28:41,833 --> 00:28:42,958
I got it.

583
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,250
Come on.
- Where?

584
00:28:46,416 --> 00:28:47,833
I could be a strange
urban boy to you..

585
00:28:47,916 --> 00:28:49,583
..but I will drop you since I
have taken the responsibility.

586
00:28:50,666 --> 00:28:52,541
The bus stand is right ahead.
We need to take a bus. Come on.

587
00:28:53,833 --> 00:28:54,958
Come on.

588
00:29:03,375 --> 00:29:05,041
Can we get a bus for
sector 5 from here?

589
00:29:05,166 --> 00:29:06,291
No.

590
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:15,166
You could have asked me. We won't
get a bus for sector 5 from here.

591
00:29:15,875 --> 00:29:18,250
Because of your auto drama, we
have to go via a break journey.

592
00:29:18,333 --> 00:29:20,791
Even I am getting late for office
and yet I am going for your sake. Okay?

593
00:29:23,625 --> 00:29:24,791
Come on, the bus is here.

594
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:27,208
Jaraghata. Jaraghata. Brother,
come on, Jaraghata. Jaraghata.

595
00:29:27,291 --> 00:29:29,208
Hey, come on. Why are you standing?
We need to get up on the bus.

596
00:29:29,291 --> 00:29:32,833
Yes. - Come on. - Come on,
come on. Jaraghata. Jaraghata..

597
00:29:32,958 --> 00:29:34,250
Which side should I get up from? Hey,
get up from whichever side..

598
00:29:34,333 --> 00:29:35,458
..you want to get up from. You
will come to the same place.

599
00:29:35,541 --> 00:29:36,625
Make it fast.

600
00:29:43,916 --> 00:29:47,625
Yes, I am in the bus. Hey, I
told you that I am in the bus.

601
00:29:50,416 --> 00:29:53,625
Hey, father is calling up. I
will talk to you later, okay?

602
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:54,833
Love you. Love you.

603
00:29:54,916 --> 00:29:59,583
Hello. Yes. No, no, I
was talking to father.

604
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:01,875
Yes.

605
00:30:03,666 --> 00:30:05,791
No, not today. Shall we meet tomorrow?

606
00:30:05,875 --> 00:30:07,583
By the way, you have a car, right?

607
00:30:10,541 --> 00:30:13,416
Oh no, actually when
I get up on a bus..

608
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,833
..I feel like vomiting.

609
00:30:17,291 --> 00:30:18,833
I see. Okay, okay. Bye.

610
00:30:19,958 --> 00:30:21,083
Love you.

611
00:30:27,916 --> 00:30:29,041
Where do you want to go?

612
00:30:32,083 --> 00:30:35,333
I want to get down. Stop
the bus. I want to get down.

613
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:36,750
I want to get down.

614
00:30:38,125 --> 00:30:39,250
Stop the bus.

615
00:30:39,625 --> 00:30:41,166
Stop the bus.
- Hey, she wants to get down..

616
00:30:41,208 --> 00:30:42,583
I want to get down.
I want to get down.

617
00:30:44,666 --> 00:30:46,041
Hey! Strange!
- Hey, come on, come on, come on.

618
00:30:51,666 --> 00:30:54,291
Hello. What happened?

619
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:55,916
Now you got down from the bus as well.

620
00:30:56,125 --> 00:30:57,875
Has sister asked you to
get down from the bus midway?

621
00:30:58,291 --> 00:30:59,583
No.
- So?

622
00:30:59,708 --> 00:31:02,125
Actually I couldn't see
you in the bus. That is why..

623
00:31:02,333 --> 00:31:04,166
That is the reason I got down.

624
00:31:04,875 --> 00:31:06,875
Where were you?
- I..

625
00:31:08,541 --> 00:31:10,166
Come with me. Keep walking.
That would be better.

626
00:31:10,458 --> 00:31:11,666
Come on.

627
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:18,166
Do you smoke?

628
00:31:23,125 --> 00:31:26,333
Even alcohol?
- Yes.

629
00:31:29,791 --> 00:31:33,541
And the other bad habits?

630
00:31:34,958 --> 00:31:36,125
What are those?

631
00:31:38,208 --> 00:31:39,291
What? Stealing and robbing?

632
00:31:40,916 --> 00:31:42,041
I see. Murder?

633
00:31:45,041 --> 00:31:47,125
Don't they call these bad
habits in your Balughat?

634
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,375
No, they do. I wanted to know if..

635
00:31:53,166 --> 00:31:56,375
Yes, Swapan. Okay, has
Paresh told you anything?

636
00:31:57,041 --> 00:31:59,166
Yes, I had called you
but it kept ringing.

637
00:31:59,958 --> 00:32:01,625
Listen, the pain of my
legs has increased a lot.

638
00:32:01,708 --> 00:32:04,458
Hey..
- Yes! Keep quiet now.

639
00:32:05,458 --> 00:32:07,916
Hey, actually there was some sort of
a muscle pull while riding the bike.

640
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,625
Hey..
- Yes.

641
00:32:09,708 --> 00:32:10,833
Hey, listen to me.

642
00:32:11,791 --> 00:32:14,958
Yes, I did go to the doctor. One
minute, I am talking on the phone.

643
00:32:15,708 --> 00:32:16,833
Yes.

644
00:32:17,833 --> 00:32:19,666
Hey, I will get a little late.
Please manage a little.

645
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:24,916
Okay, thank you. Okay,
what is your problem? Yes?

646
00:32:25,208 --> 00:32:26,416
What is it? Do you have stomach ache?

647
00:32:26,625 --> 00:32:28,375
So? Why didn't you let
me talk on the phone?

648
00:32:28,875 --> 00:32:30,708
In the last call you said
that you have a stomach problem.

649
00:32:30,791 --> 00:32:31,958
Now you said that your leg is paining.

650
00:32:36,583 --> 00:32:39,375
Okay, fine. Come on, come on.
I need to drop you, right?

651
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:49,416
Hey, will you go to sector 5?

652
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,916
I wouldn't go in meter.
- You wouldn't? Okay.

653
00:33:08,666 --> 00:33:10,583
"She rolls up her eyes a bit."

654
00:33:10,958 --> 00:33:12,916
"She crinkles her nose a bit."

655
00:33:13,375 --> 00:33:18,000
"The good girl is a
little easy comparatively."

656
00:33:18,083 --> 00:33:20,083
"She rolls up her eyes a bit."

657
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:22,375
"She crinkles her nose a bit."

658
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:27,000
"The good girl is a
little easy comparatively."

659
00:33:27,083 --> 00:33:29,750
"I don't know her name or house."

660
00:33:29,833 --> 00:33:31,666
"But I got stuck with her."

661
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:34,375
"And when there was sunshine.."

662
00:33:34,458 --> 00:33:37,166
"..it started
raining all of a sudden."

663
00:33:37,291 --> 00:33:39,625
"This is strange, God."
- Brother. - Yes? - Will you drop us?

664
00:33:39,708 --> 00:33:41,750
"You have made me fall
into this mess." - Come on.

665
00:33:41,916 --> 00:33:43,541
"She doesn't move. She doesn't move."
- Come on, push.

666
00:33:43,666 --> 00:33:46,541
Why should we push?
- "A new girl in Kolkata." - Lift.

667
00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:48,916
"Oh my dear Lord. Oh my dear Lord."

668
00:33:48,958 --> 00:33:51,041
"You have made me
fall into this mess."

669
00:33:51,333 --> 00:33:52,583
"She doesn't move."
- My bag.

670
00:33:52,666 --> 00:33:53,708
My bag.
- "She doesn't move."

671
00:33:53,791 --> 00:33:55,750
"A new girl in Kolkata."
- Saw that?

672
00:33:57,916 --> 00:33:59,041
Do you have some change?

673
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,958
"She gives a cry of fear
anytime she feels like."

674
00:34:17,041 --> 00:34:19,083
"She is a girl of 18 and her choices
are of an eighty year old woman."

675
00:34:19,166 --> 00:34:21,666
"She is so strange in her mannerisms."

676
00:34:21,708 --> 00:34:23,291
"I feel like laughing."

677
00:34:23,791 --> 00:34:26,250
"She gives a cry of fear
anytime she feels like."

678
00:34:26,333 --> 00:34:28,458
"She is a girl of 18 and her choices
are of an eighty year old woman."

679
00:34:28,541 --> 00:34:30,875
"She is so strange in her mannerisms."

680
00:34:30,958 --> 00:34:32,583
"She came and fell on my shoulders."

681
00:34:32,666 --> 00:34:35,500
"I don't know her name or house."

682
00:34:35,583 --> 00:34:37,416
"But I got stuck with her."

683
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:40,083
"And when there was sunshine.."

684
00:34:40,208 --> 00:34:42,833
"..it started
raining all of a sudden."

685
00:34:52,708 --> 00:34:55,791
Hey, hey, hey. What did you just do?
Tell me. - Keep quiet. Please.

686
00:34:57,125 --> 00:34:58,291
Don't you have any
faith or devotion for God?

687
00:34:58,375 --> 00:35:00,041
What if God curses me now?
What if I don't get a job now?

688
00:35:00,125 --> 00:35:02,208
Quiet. Quiet.

689
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:13,166
"He pulls me in every
direction whenever he wants."

690
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:15,583
"I don't know
whether he walks or runs."

691
00:35:15,625 --> 00:35:17,916
"The man is always in full motion."

692
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,791
"He gives me wrong instructions."

693
00:35:20,166 --> 00:35:22,541
"He pulls me in every
direction whenever he wants."

694
00:35:22,625 --> 00:35:24,916
"I don't know
whether he walks or runs."

695
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,416
"The man is always in full motion."

696
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,958
"I don't know whom I
have been stuck with."

697
00:35:29,041 --> 00:35:31,833
"Hey, I am confused. I
don't know where I am going."

698
00:35:31,916 --> 00:35:33,791
"How should I walk?"

699
00:35:33,833 --> 00:35:39,166
"And on the other side, how can
I walk on relying on a stranger?"

700
00:35:39,416 --> 00:35:41,666
I am sorry. Go on.
- "Oh Lord. Oh Lord."

701
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:44,041
"Whose shoulders have I fallen on?"

702
00:35:44,166 --> 00:35:46,333
"I don't know anything.
I can't hear anything."

703
00:35:46,416 --> 00:35:48,583
"This is a strange place."

704
00:35:48,666 --> 00:35:50,958
"Oh Lord. Oh Lord."

705
00:35:51,041 --> 00:35:53,416
"Whose shoulders have I fallen on?"

706
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,625
"I don't know anything.
I can't hear anything."

707
00:35:55,708 --> 00:35:57,833
"This is a strange place."

708
00:35:57,916 --> 00:35:59,666
"She rolls up her eyes a bit."

709
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,041
"She crinkles her nose a bit."

710
00:36:02,458 --> 00:36:06,583
"The good girl is a
little easy comparatively."

711
00:36:06,625 --> 00:36:09,416
"I don't know her name or house."

712
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,333
"But I got stuck with her."

713
00:36:11,416 --> 00:36:14,166
"And when there was sunshine.."

714
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:16,833
"..it started
raining all of a sudden."

715
00:36:16,875 --> 00:36:19,166
"Oh Lord. Oh Lord."
- I got it.

716
00:36:19,208 --> 00:36:21,166
"You have made me fall into a mess."
- Yes, that is it.

717
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:22,708
I don't have time.
- "She doesn't move.

718
00:36:22,791 --> 00:36:23,875
She doesn't move."
- Listen, tell me..

719
00:36:23,958 --> 00:36:25,791
..how is your work going on?
- "A new girl in Kolkata."

720
00:36:25,875 --> 00:36:28,708
I see. Yes.
- "Oh Lord. Oh Lord."

721
00:36:28,791 --> 00:36:30,791
What are you saying?
- "You have made me fall into a mess."

722
00:36:30,875 --> 00:36:32,791
"She doesn't know anything.
She doesn't understand anything."

723
00:36:32,875 --> 00:36:35,250
Leave me.
- "She is a new girl in Kolkata.

724
00:36:35,333 --> 00:36:38,416
A girl is sitting beside me.
Just talking like an illiterate.

725
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,416
"You have made me fall into a mess."
- Like a villager.

726
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:44,791
Excuse me. I know English.
Don't underestimate me.

727
00:36:45,083 --> 00:36:46,208
I am graduate.

728
00:36:46,875 --> 00:36:49,583
Villager.
- "You have made me fall into a mess."

729
00:36:52,125 --> 00:36:54,416
"New girl in Kolkata."

730
00:36:54,541 --> 00:36:56,166
"Oh Lord."

731
00:37:09,458 --> 00:37:11,250
Everyone who is here
for the interview..

732
00:37:11,291 --> 00:37:12,875
..has to go to the
first floor using the lift.

733
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,625
Go, they are calling you.

734
00:37:15,083 --> 00:37:16,666
What?
- First floor.

735
00:37:18,625 --> 00:37:19,791
I am leaving.

736
00:37:21,541 --> 00:37:22,666
All the best.

737
00:37:31,083 --> 00:37:32,250
Thank you.

738
00:37:50,458 --> 00:37:52,125
Hey, this.. Hello.

739
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:54,166
What?
- The bag.

740
00:37:54,208 --> 00:37:55,375
I see.

741
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,791
Hey..
- Oh Lord.

742
00:38:20,291 --> 00:38:23,875
Okay, there was a man
who was here with two bags.

743
00:38:24,041 --> 00:38:25,166
Have you seen him?

744
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:27,125
Was he standing here? He was
the one who came with you?

745
00:38:27,166 --> 00:38:28,458
Yes, yes.
- He has left.

746
00:38:29,833 --> 00:38:31,000
What do you mean he has left?

747
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:33,166
My bags were with him.

748
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:35,291
Call him.
- I don't have his number.

749
00:38:35,375 --> 00:38:38,375
What do you mean you don't have it?
- I met him on the road.

750
00:38:39,291 --> 00:38:42,708
You met him on the road and you
trusted him and gave the bag to him.

751
00:38:44,041 --> 00:38:46,375
Actually I felt he is a gentleman.

752
00:38:46,458 --> 00:38:48,000
Thieves look like gentlemen.

753
00:38:48,083 --> 00:38:50,958
They don't have a thick
moustache like the film villains. Yes.

754
00:38:51,041 --> 00:38:52,416
Kajal.
- Yes.

755
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,041
Yes, yes, I am coming.

756
00:39:03,583 --> 00:39:06,333
I heard that they got information
from the matrimonial. Right?

757
00:39:06,791 --> 00:39:08,583
Yes, what do you say?
- Yes, yes.

758
00:39:09,083 --> 00:39:10,250
Father was earlier..

759
00:39:11,708 --> 00:39:14,333
Is he your husband? -Yes.

760
00:39:15,125 --> 00:39:16,458
He looks very ugly, right?

761
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:18,166
No, he looks okay.

762
00:39:20,208 --> 00:39:22,166
If I would have met you earlier..

763
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:24,291
..I wouldn't have married her.
I would have married you.

764
00:39:25,083 --> 00:39:27,375
Mother, look.

765
00:39:27,458 --> 00:39:30,291
That boy is proposing to me.

766
00:39:30,375 --> 00:39:32,250
What is this..
- She is so sweet, right?

767
00:39:32,333 --> 00:39:34,750
Mummum, you have grown up too much.
Come on, come and sit here.

768
00:39:48,791 --> 00:39:50,583
Hello.
- Hello, hospital.

769
00:39:50,916 --> 00:39:52,500
There has been an accident
on the Govindpur RA depot.

770
00:39:52,583 --> 00:39:55,166
Accident? Okay, tell me
the address correctly.

771
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:57,791
The condition is very serious.
Send an ambulance quickly.

772
00:39:57,875 --> 00:40:00,916
Two buses have collided? On the NH34?

773
00:40:01,416 --> 00:40:02,750
Okay, how many
people have been killed?

774
00:40:03,291 --> 00:40:05,041
Okay, tell me the exact location.

775
00:40:08,666 --> 00:40:11,791
"Be careful while placing footsteps."

776
00:40:12,791 --> 00:40:16,458
"My friends."
- I wouldn't do it anymore.

777
00:40:16,541 --> 00:40:19,041
"Let us see once."
- I swear on mother.

778
00:40:19,833 --> 00:40:22,333
"Who has guts?"

779
00:40:23,291 --> 00:40:25,875
"Be careful while
placing your footsteps."

780
00:40:32,041 --> 00:40:40,416
"Hail Allah. The Supreme
Lord of all. Lord is great.

781
00:40:40,458 --> 00:40:47,958
"Lord is the best and he protects
everyone. He is the greatest Lord.

782
00:40:48,041 --> 00:40:50,708
Come and buy my ware.
Come and buy my ware.

783
00:40:51,125 --> 00:40:56,458
Come and buy my ware.
Come and buy my ware.

784
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:36,833
Come and buy my ware.

785
00:41:44,208 --> 00:41:47,833
Come and buy my ware.

786
00:42:15,625 --> 00:42:18,291
Good morning.
- Very good morning.

787
00:42:20,166 --> 00:42:22,250
I see. So you are wearing a
shirt of this color today?

788
00:42:22,833 --> 00:42:24,875
So I am sure, today,
even she is wearing.. - Yes.

789
00:42:25,416 --> 00:42:29,291
Just be careful, Noor. You are
watching her from a distance, right?

790
00:42:29,375 --> 00:42:31,750
She looks like a star from a distance.

791
00:42:31,958 --> 00:42:34,333
And when you look at her closely
she will look like burnt coal.

792
00:42:43,666 --> 00:42:46,375
What is it, Noor? You
look very handsome today.

793
00:42:46,458 --> 00:42:47,750
Yes, yes, even you do.

794
00:42:48,291 --> 00:42:50,083
I guess your lover
has worn blue today.

795
00:42:50,166 --> 00:42:52,750
Yes. And yours has worn this color?

796
00:42:53,791 --> 00:42:54,958
Yes.

797
00:42:56,416 --> 00:42:57,541
Hey, what is this?

798
00:42:57,625 --> 00:42:59,250
Why are you wearing a
red colored shirt inside?

799
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:01,083
This one?
- Yes. - For the one outside.

800
00:43:01,166 --> 00:43:02,333
And there is another
one for the evening.

801
00:43:03,041 --> 00:43:04,708
The one outside wore blue today.

802
00:43:05,125 --> 00:43:06,250
I met her and came.

803
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:08,958
And I will meet the
neighbor in the evening.

804
00:43:09,625 --> 00:43:10,708
What is it, short one? -Yes?

805
00:43:10,791 --> 00:43:12,541
What is the matter? You
are in a uniform today?

806
00:43:12,625 --> 00:43:14,166
Hey, my lover is a police constable.

807
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:16,791
Yes. - Parvati. She is
wearing the uniform today.

808
00:43:18,166 --> 00:43:19,333
Hey, hey.. -Hey!

809
00:43:19,416 --> 00:43:22,041
Now you are done with the painting..

810
00:43:22,125 --> 00:43:25,333
..after doing the color combinations.
Now start the work.

811
00:43:26,208 --> 00:43:28,625
Your mindset is so childish..

812
00:43:28,708 --> 00:43:31,250
..that you will just keep on
looking at girls all your life.

813
00:43:31,333 --> 00:43:32,541
You wouldn't be able to get them.

814
00:43:32,625 --> 00:43:35,291
I have told you. Go on, go on.
Now go and start the machine.

815
00:43:35,375 --> 00:43:36,458
Too much.

816
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,250
Hey! Who are you?

817
00:44:54,333 --> 00:44:57,250
Yes? What are you doing in my room?

818
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,083
Get out of the room.

819
00:45:04,166 --> 00:45:05,708
People will
misunderstand if they spot you here.

820
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:07,833
People can also misunderstand..

821
00:45:07,875 --> 00:45:09,000
..when you wave your
hand from this terrace..

822
00:45:09,083 --> 00:45:11,208
..to that terrace, give signals,
smile with all your teeth out.

823
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:12,666
Right? True, isn't it?
- I..

824
00:45:13,041 --> 00:45:15,333
How are you bothered if I give
signals to some girl or not?

825
00:45:16,458 --> 00:45:17,708
I am bothered.

826
00:45:18,625 --> 00:45:20,916
Because that girl in question.. is me.

827
00:45:23,625 --> 00:45:25,791
Yes, I know you cannot see my
face clearly from a distance.

828
00:45:25,833 --> 00:45:26,958
But don't you understand if there
is a difference between a girl..

829
00:45:27,041 --> 00:45:28,125
..and her mother?

830
00:45:29,208 --> 00:45:30,791
Hey, do you have some
defect in your eyes?

831
00:45:31,875 --> 00:45:34,666
Do you know? You give signals to
my mother instead of me at times.

832
00:45:34,833 --> 00:45:36,125
Now how can I make mother understand..

833
00:45:36,208 --> 00:45:38,875
..that you have dialed a wrong
number? - You are very good looking.

834
00:45:39,083 --> 00:45:40,250
You have been watching
me for the last 6 months.

835
00:45:40,666 --> 00:45:42,666
You know very well that I come to
the terrace around 8 in the morning.

836
00:45:43,208 --> 00:45:45,375
So you can stand from 7.45 to 8.15.

837
00:45:45,458 --> 00:45:46,708
What difference does it
make if I come or not?

838
00:45:46,833 --> 00:45:47,958
And what should you
stand there for so long?

839
00:45:48,041 --> 00:45:49,833
You can just wave your hands for
no reason. Why? What is the point?

840
00:45:50,083 --> 00:45:51,875
Listen, I have come to know
that you are hitting on me..

841
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:54,083
..two days after you started
doing it. And I understood as well.

842
00:45:54,166 --> 00:45:55,708
And then, I saw you in the
different shops of the colony.

843
00:45:55,791 --> 00:45:58,000
In the tea shop or cigarette shop..
- I don't smoke cigarettes.

844
00:45:58,041 --> 00:46:00,041
I know. Your friends do.

845
00:46:00,125 --> 00:46:01,791
You sit in the tea stall
and yet don't have tea.

846
00:46:01,833 --> 00:46:02,958
You have milk.

847
00:46:03,875 --> 00:46:05,041
What is your name?

848
00:46:05,125 --> 00:46:06,250
Noor Islam.

849
00:46:07,291 --> 00:46:08,500
Muslim?

850
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:10,416
Will do.

851
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:12,083
I had thought that when I
meet you for the first time..

852
00:46:12,166 --> 00:46:13,375
..I will give you two tight slaps.

853
00:46:14,458 --> 00:46:16,000
And then I saw that you seem good
enough to look at and talk well.

854
00:46:16,083 --> 00:46:17,208
I changed my decision.

855
00:46:17,916 --> 00:46:19,333
What is your salary?
- What?

856
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:21,583
How much do you get as salary?

857
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,166
6000.

858
00:46:25,458 --> 00:46:26,541
It is the 6th of the month..

859
00:46:26,625 --> 00:46:27,750
..and yet you haven't opened
the envelope of the salary.

860
00:46:32,416 --> 00:46:35,250
There is an alarm of 6 in the mobile.
I guess it is for me.

861
00:46:37,791 --> 00:46:39,958
There is no name other than
your mother on the call list. Why?

862
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:42,750
What? - You don't call anyone
and no one calls you either.

863
00:46:42,791 --> 00:46:45,416
Yes. Why did you call mother..
Why did you have to call mother?

864
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:46,666
Yes?

865
00:46:47,625 --> 00:46:50,708
Mother.
- Yes, tell me.

866
00:46:51,041 --> 00:46:53,875
Mother. Don't believe a word
that the girl has told you.

867
00:46:53,958 --> 00:46:55,166
She spoke rubbish to you.

868
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:57,500
What? What are you saying?

869
00:46:57,750 --> 00:46:59,625
Are you intoxicated in the morning?

870
00:46:59,708 --> 00:47:00,833
What are you saying?

871
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:04,666
Hey, what did you tell mother?

872
00:47:04,791 --> 00:47:06,083
I haven't told her anything.
I haven't even called her.

873
00:47:06,166 --> 00:47:07,500
You thought of it on your own.

874
00:47:10,125 --> 00:47:12,500
Mother, I will call you later.
I am leaving for work.

875
00:47:22,166 --> 00:47:24,958
You are very scared of mother. Why?

876
00:47:26,541 --> 00:47:27,958
Why? What is the need to be so scared?

877
00:47:33,666 --> 00:47:35,750
You wear clothes by
matching your clothes with mine?

878
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:38,625
Why?

879
00:47:38,875 --> 00:47:40,041
Do you love me?

880
00:47:46,833 --> 00:47:48,958
Come to the kids'
garden at 5 in the evening.

881
00:47:49,541 --> 00:47:51,291
Kids?
- Yes.

882
00:47:52,333 --> 00:47:53,708
It is just right for you.

883
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:56,625
But they wouldn't let me
go before 7 in the evening.

884
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:59,125
Take permission and come to the
kids' garden at 5 in the evening.

885
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:01,125
But two hours prior to the..
- Take leave.

886
00:48:01,666 --> 00:48:03,458
But from the time I
have started working..

887
00:48:03,541 --> 00:48:04,666
..till date, I
haven't taken a leave ever.

888
00:48:04,708 --> 00:48:06,708
Now start taking them. As
you fallen in love now..

889
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:08,333
..you will have to do a
lot of things like this now.

890
00:48:08,416 --> 00:48:09,708
Bunking office. Telling lies.

891
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:12,250
Talking to the police with courage.
Thrashing people.

892
00:48:12,333 --> 00:48:14,708
The faster you learn all this
the better it will be for you.

893
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:16,708
And if you cannot do this,
don't have an affair.

894
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:18,000
There is no point.

895
00:48:26,291 --> 00:48:28,291
And get the salary
envelope while coming.

896
00:48:29,791 --> 00:48:30,916
I need it.

897
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:41,958
"No, no."

898
00:48:42,041 --> 00:48:44,125
"The heart cannot handle it anymore."

899
00:48:44,916 --> 00:48:49,125
"My heart is absolutely in
pieces because of just one person."

900
00:48:49,208 --> 00:48:50,625
"No, no."

901
00:48:50,708 --> 00:48:52,791
"The heart doesn't care about anyone."

902
00:48:53,958 --> 00:48:57,833
"I am spending my days
well in a sweet pain."

903
00:48:57,916 --> 00:49:00,083
"In the house or the shop.
Here and there."

904
00:49:00,166 --> 00:49:02,583
"And everywhere. I lose control."

905
00:49:06,583 --> 00:49:07,708
"In my surroundings and colony."

906
00:49:07,791 --> 00:49:11,250
"At my call to them and
their response. I like standing."

907
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:19,000
"I am in a bad condition."

908
00:49:19,125 --> 00:49:23,458
"There is a woman who
had made this web for me."

909
00:49:23,541 --> 00:49:28,291
"Who will take care of
me in this condition?"

910
00:49:28,333 --> 00:49:29,791
"No, no."

911
00:49:29,833 --> 00:49:32,041
"The heart cannot handle it anymore."

912
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:37,333
"My heart is absolutely in
pieces because of just one person."

913
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:05,000
"I am in love."

914
00:50:05,333 --> 00:50:07,208
"Now I am not available to anyone."

915
00:50:07,583 --> 00:50:11,833
"Now I will be roaming around in
parks or sometimes in cinemas."

916
00:50:15,791 --> 00:50:18,000
"Hey, the seats of the
autos and the buses."

917
00:50:18,375 --> 00:50:20,208
"Will be adjacent to each other."

918
00:50:20,541 --> 00:50:24,458
"Now I will be rocking and do
whatever my heart feels like."

919
00:50:24,583 --> 00:50:28,541
"Hey, look, I am
getting late for office."

920
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:33,041
"I have become a graduate of love."

921
00:50:33,291 --> 00:50:38,041
"Who will take care of
me in this condition?"

922
00:50:38,125 --> 00:50:39,375
"No, no."

923
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:41,916
"The heart cannot handle it anymore."

924
00:50:42,708 --> 00:50:47,041
"My heart is absolutely in
pieces because of just one person."

925
00:51:04,083 --> 00:51:06,000
"Her two pretty eyes."

926
00:51:06,166 --> 00:51:08,166
"It says so many things."

927
00:51:08,333 --> 00:51:12,875
"As soon as she smiled, I am
stuck midway through the river.'

928
00:51:16,666 --> 00:51:19,083
"In her pursed lips."

929
00:51:19,333 --> 00:51:21,333
"She has 100 swords."

930
00:51:21,583 --> 00:51:25,625
"I feel I have fallen
for everything she says."

931
00:51:25,708 --> 00:51:29,791
"I am in a bad condition."

932
00:51:29,875 --> 00:51:34,333
"There is a woman who
had made this web for me."

933
00:51:34,458 --> 00:51:38,958
"Who will take care of
me in this condition?"

934
00:51:39,041 --> 00:51:40,458
"No, no."

935
00:51:40,541 --> 00:51:42,625
"The heart cannot handle it anymore."

936
00:51:43,625 --> 00:51:47,750
"My heart is absolutely in
pieces because of just one person."

937
00:51:47,791 --> 00:51:49,125
"No, no."

938
00:51:49,208 --> 00:51:51,500
"The heart doesn't care about anyone."

939
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:56,416
"I am spending my days
well in a sweet pain."

940
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:58,625
"In the house or the shop.
Here and there."

941
00:51:58,708 --> 00:52:01,041
"And everywhere. I lose control."

942
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:06,166
"In my surroundings and colony."

943
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:09,833
"At my call to them and
their response. I like standing."

944
00:52:13,875 --> 00:52:17,583
"I am in a bad condition."

945
00:52:17,833 --> 00:52:21,875
"There is a woman who
had made this web for me."

946
00:52:22,041 --> 00:52:26,916
"Who will take care of
me in this condition?"

947
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,291
"No, no."

948
00:52:28,416 --> 00:52:30,500
"My heart cannot handle it anymore."

949
00:52:31,541 --> 00:52:36,000
"My heart is torn into
pieces because one woman."

950
00:52:39,125 --> 00:52:40,708
Will you have ice-cream?
- Yes, I will.

951
00:52:41,875 --> 00:52:43,625
Two oil sticks.
- Yes, yes.

952
00:52:45,333 --> 00:52:46,458
Don't take this.

953
00:52:51,458 --> 00:52:52,708
Hey, what happened? Come on.

954
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:00,458
Hey, Noor..

955
00:53:00,666 --> 00:53:01,875
You are here?

956
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,875
With my elder brother..

957
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,250
He works with my elder brother.

958
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,041
She stays in my colony.
She is very weak in math.

959
00:53:10,416 --> 00:53:12,500
That is why I am taking
her inside to teach her math.

960
00:53:14,041 --> 00:53:15,375
Come on, come on.

961
00:53:15,625 --> 00:53:17,625
Come on, come on. You
go ahead. I will come.

962
00:53:19,833 --> 00:53:21,000
Please don't make me
fall into trouble, brother.

963
00:53:21,166 --> 00:53:22,541
I have just managed
to impress this girl.

964
00:53:23,625 --> 00:53:25,916
Don't speak about math.
Change the subject.

965
00:53:26,625 --> 00:53:27,833
Go.

966
00:53:29,250 --> 00:53:30,666
Yes, come on.

967
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:32,041
One minute.

968
00:53:33,875 --> 00:53:37,625
Brother, please don't tell his
brother that we had come here.

969
00:53:38,833 --> 00:53:39,958
Ice-cream?

970
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,125
No, no, that is fine.
- Hey, have it.

971
00:53:41,208 --> 00:53:43,416
I am like your sister.
I haven't tasted it yet.

972
00:53:46,416 --> 00:53:47,541
Thank you.

973
00:53:55,041 --> 00:53:56,916
Hey, throw the ball at me..
- Hey, this side.

974
00:54:22,416 --> 00:54:23,583
Easy Mart.

975
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:28,541
'Should I tell her
now that I love her?'

976
00:54:28,833 --> 00:54:30,958
'Or should I go to Easy Mart and
tell her?' - Why are you smiling?

977
00:54:31,625 --> 00:54:33,666
What?
- Why are you smiling?

978
00:54:34,291 --> 00:54:37,333
Why? I am not smiling. My
face is like that. Smiling.

979
00:54:38,166 --> 00:54:39,333
Let me see.

980
00:54:39,916 --> 00:54:41,791
Have you worn lipstick?
- No.

981
00:54:43,291 --> 00:54:45,958
I see. Now.. I was having ice-cream.

982
00:54:46,041 --> 00:54:47,208
It must be the color of the ice-cream.

983
00:54:48,791 --> 00:54:50,500
Is it gone? Yes? Is it gone?

984
00:54:51,125 --> 00:54:52,208
Is it gone?

985
00:54:52,291 --> 00:54:53,416
I don't know.

986
00:54:55,916 --> 00:54:57,208
Pay the fare and come.

987
00:55:01,916 --> 00:55:03,125
How much is it, brother?

988
00:55:08,583 --> 00:55:11,083
I was saying, let us go outside.
I am feeling very hot.

989
00:55:14,083 --> 00:55:15,708
What is the size?
- Of what?

990
00:55:19,333 --> 00:55:21,333
Of the waist.
- I see. I don't know.

991
00:55:23,208 --> 00:55:24,291
You don't know the measurement?

992
00:55:24,375 --> 00:55:26,166
No.
- Of the waist. - No, I don't know.

993
00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:27,958
I mean, I get it
made from the tailors.

994
00:55:28,041 --> 00:55:29,208
So they take measurements and make it.

995
00:55:29,291 --> 00:55:31,166
I don't know. - 'Someone from
the South board department..

996
00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:32,958
..please come and report at
the counter.' - Excuse me.

997
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:36,125
Please take the
measurement of his waist.

998
00:55:36,208 --> 00:55:38,333
Hey, isn't there a boy to
do it? Hey, stand properly.

999
00:55:40,083 --> 00:55:41,500
Pick up the shirt.
- What?

1000
00:55:41,708 --> 00:55:43,250
Pick up the shirt.
- Hey, Ria.

1001
00:55:43,791 --> 00:55:45,000
Take the measurements above the shirt.

1002
00:55:45,083 --> 00:55:46,166
Okay.

1003
00:55:46,666 --> 00:55:49,291
'This call is for the electrician
is to report at the back office..'

1004
00:55:49,333 --> 00:55:52,291
'..of the first floor in
the electronics department.

1005
00:55:52,375 --> 00:55:53,750
'Come to the back office.'

1006
00:55:54,375 --> 00:55:55,791
32, madam.
- What?

1007
00:55:55,875 --> 00:55:57,333
32.
- Thank you.

1008
00:55:57,416 --> 00:55:58,541
Welcome.

1009
00:55:59,750 --> 00:56:01,958
Okay, how will my waist size help you?

1010
00:56:02,041 --> 00:56:03,125
Move.

1011
00:56:03,916 --> 00:56:05,041
Move.

1012
00:56:06,708 --> 00:56:09,750
It can be very useful. It
is my cousin's birthday.

1013
00:56:09,833 --> 00:56:11,208
He looks a lot like you.

1014
00:56:12,166 --> 00:56:15,166
If I buy clothes of your size,
it will fit them.

1015
00:56:16,916 --> 00:56:18,166
Wow, great.

1016
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:20,208
It is your cousin's birthday
and you had to come here..

1017
00:56:20,291 --> 00:56:22,500
..to buy his clothes. And I had
to pay the auto fare. Wow, wow.

1018
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,541
Did you say something?
- No, nothing.

1019
00:56:26,291 --> 00:56:28,500
Look, how is this pant?

1020
00:56:29,041 --> 00:56:32,333
It is very nice. It is very
nice since you have chosen it.

1021
00:56:32,833 --> 00:56:35,250
Hey, hey, one second. Wait,
look here, it is torn here.

1022
00:56:35,833 --> 00:56:37,208
What is it?
- It is torn.

1023
00:56:37,791 --> 00:56:38,958
I see.

1024
00:56:41,458 --> 00:56:44,708
What is this? - Hey, this
is torn further. It is old.

1025
00:56:45,625 --> 00:56:47,875
Keep it back.
- This is not torn. This is a trend.

1026
00:56:48,041 --> 00:56:49,125
I mean, it is a style.

1027
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,083
I see.
- Come on.

1028
00:56:53,041 --> 00:56:54,666
Hey, even torn
things are in style now?

1029
00:56:57,708 --> 00:56:58,833
Where is your house?

1030
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:00,875
Shibpur. Murshidabad.

1031
00:57:04,083 --> 00:57:05,583
I have to do a lot with you.

1032
00:57:07,958 --> 00:57:09,250
Look, how is this shirt?

1033
00:57:09,708 --> 00:57:12,583
It is very nice. I think God
has made this for your brother.

1034
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:14,583
Hold it.

1035
00:57:15,416 --> 00:57:16,541
Come on.

1036
00:57:23,458 --> 00:57:24,583
Do you like it?

1037
00:57:24,833 --> 00:57:26,500
No.
- Will my brother like it?

1038
00:57:26,583 --> 00:57:27,708
Does he look like me?

1039
00:57:27,916 --> 00:57:29,500
Almost.

1040
00:57:29,708 --> 00:57:31,041
Then I guess it
would look nice on him.

1041
00:57:32,833 --> 00:57:35,750
Excuse me. Pack that T-shirt as well.

1042
00:57:39,916 --> 00:57:41,125
Here you are.
- Thank you.

1043
00:57:43,875 --> 00:57:45,083
Rupees 4000?

1044
00:57:45,166 --> 00:57:47,583
Give it.
- What do you mean? Why should I pay?

1045
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:50,166
It is because I am asking you to pay.
- What?

1046
00:57:54,125 --> 00:57:55,583
God knows where did
Shankar impress that girl..

1047
00:57:55,666 --> 00:57:57,041
..with the ice-cream in the park.

1048
00:57:57,666 --> 00:57:59,333
Hey! Hey!

1049
00:57:59,416 --> 00:58:01,083
What? - What are you
whispering about? Tell me.

1050
00:58:01,166 --> 00:58:02,333
No, nothing.

1051
00:58:04,041 --> 00:58:05,166
Make it fast.

1052
00:58:13,291 --> 00:58:16,291
Hey.. - If you count it again and
again, 4000 wouldn't become 8000.

1053
00:58:20,916 --> 00:58:22,083
Here you are, brother.

1054
00:58:24,875 --> 00:58:26,291
One, two..
- Thank you.

1055
00:58:26,375 --> 00:58:29,708
Welcome. - Let us go. Do
you want to stand here?

1056
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:31,625
Come on.

1057
00:58:32,416 --> 00:58:34,791
And then she said that..
- Yes, yes, go on, tell me.

1058
00:58:42,583 --> 00:58:43,750
Hey!

1059
00:58:51,875 --> 00:58:53,208
What do you want to eat?
- What?

1060
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:55,833
One egg roll. More
sauce with less chilies.

1061
00:58:56,041 --> 00:58:57,708
This is a cafeteria and
coffee is available here.

1062
00:58:57,791 --> 00:58:59,375
Yes, fine, let me
order for the roll first..

1063
00:58:59,458 --> 00:59:00,958
..and then I will have the coffee.
- Quiet.

1064
00:59:01,791 --> 00:59:04,625
This is a cafeteria. Coffee is
available here but not the roll.

1065
00:59:06,375 --> 00:59:07,666
What will you have?
Have a look and order.

1066
00:59:12,291 --> 00:59:15,666
Hey, wow. Hey, they sell so
many kinds of coffee. Yes?

1067
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:20,875
You order for me.

1068
00:59:24,791 --> 00:59:26,791
Excuse me. - Yes, madam? -
Two Devil's own, please.

1069
00:59:28,916 --> 00:59:30,083
Thank you.
- Welcome.

1070
00:59:47,625 --> 00:59:48,666
Hey!

1071
00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:51,333
Yes, sir.
- Why is the coffee cold?

1072
00:59:51,833 --> 00:59:53,041
It is cold coffee, sir.
- Meaning?

1073
00:59:53,166 --> 00:59:54,750
I ordered for the coffee
right now and it is already cold.

1074
00:59:54,833 --> 00:59:56,000
But ma'am said..
- I am extremely sorry.

1075
00:59:56,083 --> 00:59:57,958
You please carry on.
- Okay, ma'am.

1076
00:59:58,166 --> 01:00:00,333
What are you doing? - Hey,
they have served us cold coffee.

1077
01:00:00,416 --> 01:00:01,583
Have it quietly.

1078
01:00:02,041 --> 01:00:03,250
I am having it.

1079
01:00:07,916 --> 01:00:09,791
Oh no.
- I am sorry.

1080
01:00:11,541 --> 01:00:12,708
Hey, hey, not like that.

1081
01:00:14,166 --> 01:00:15,250
What.. -What are you doing?

1082
01:00:15,333 --> 01:00:16,625
What happened? Should I not have it?

1083
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:18,583
Look there.

1084
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:21,416
Bhoomi? This Saturday?

1085
01:00:22,583 --> 01:00:23,666
Did you understand something?

1086
01:00:25,583 --> 01:00:26,708
One..

1087
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:31,708
They are having a little bit of
coffee and spending a lot of time.

1088
01:00:41,125 --> 01:00:42,208
Okay.

1089
01:00:42,291 --> 01:00:44,583
In that case, both if
us will share yours..

1090
01:00:45,583 --> 01:00:46,666
No.

1091
01:00:48,250 --> 01:00:49,541
I will spend time with my coffee.

1092
01:00:51,250 --> 01:00:52,541
Oh no.

1093
01:01:04,916 --> 01:01:06,166
Oh no.

1094
01:01:07,541 --> 01:01:08,625
Here is the bill.

1095
01:01:15,291 --> 01:01:16,416
What is this?

1096
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:18,125
Hey, one coffee is for 80? Meaning?

1097
01:01:18,208 --> 01:01:19,500
Two are for 160?

1098
01:01:19,666 --> 01:01:21,250
I think they are cheating us because
we have come for the first time.

1099
01:01:21,333 --> 01:01:23,250
They are not cheating. It is for 80.

1100
01:01:23,916 --> 01:01:25,625
Hey, you can get a beer bottle for 80.

1101
01:01:25,708 --> 01:01:28,166
Hey, do you have alcohol?
- What? I? Not at all. Not at all.

1102
01:01:28,250 --> 01:01:30,208
I don't have alcohol.
My friends have it.

1103
01:01:30,541 --> 01:01:31,916
I don't have coffee and tea as well.

1104
01:01:32,250 --> 01:01:33,375
I had because you have
asked me to have it.

1105
01:01:33,458 --> 01:01:35,041
You don't have alcohol?
- No.

1106
01:01:38,875 --> 01:01:40,291
If I would have been have a boy..

1107
01:01:41,458 --> 01:01:43,083
..I would have tasted
all kinds of alcohol.

1108
01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:47,875
What are you staring at?
Pay the money.

1109
01:01:55,833 --> 01:01:56,958
What happened? Come on.

1110
01:01:57,833 --> 01:01:59,791
What about the change?
- This is called as tips.

1111
01:02:00,833 --> 01:02:02,125
What? Rupees 40?

1112
01:02:03,458 --> 01:02:04,958
Hey, Ria. Ria.

1113
01:02:05,333 --> 01:02:06,750
Tell me, where will you go now?

1114
01:02:07,625 --> 01:02:10,041
We will meet here at 5 in
the evening tomorrow. - What?

1115
01:02:10,250 --> 01:02:12,333
I was saying that somewhere else..

1116
01:02:12,416 --> 01:02:13,750
Cannot we meet at Jheel Park?

1117
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:15,666
Why? Tell me.

1118
01:02:16,458 --> 01:02:18,041
Is there some other intention?

1119
01:02:18,208 --> 01:02:19,583
Hey, oh no, oh no.
Disgusting. Hey, it is not about that.

1120
01:02:19,875 --> 01:02:22,916
I mean, I think I am really
short of cash now till tomorrow.

1121
01:02:23,208 --> 01:02:24,458
That is why I need some medicines.

1122
01:02:25,583 --> 01:02:28,125
Listen. You need to
meet Shyamal Dutta.

1123
01:02:28,208 --> 01:02:29,625
Where and when? I will
tell you about that.

1124
01:02:29,708 --> 01:02:30,833
Who is he?

1125
01:02:30,916 --> 01:02:32,416
Tell me the number.
- Whose?

1126
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:34,416
One slap..

1127
01:02:34,583 --> 01:02:35,708
Yours.

1128
01:02:35,791 --> 01:02:38,166
Yes. 94341213..

1129
01:02:38,750 --> 01:02:40,125
You can give me a
call from your phone.

1130
01:02:40,208 --> 01:02:41,500
Then I will get your mobile number.

1131
01:02:41,583 --> 01:02:42,750
What? Yes.

1132
01:02:43,458 --> 01:02:44,916
It is okay if I have your number.

1133
01:02:45,041 --> 01:02:46,875
You don't need to
have my number with you.

1134
01:02:47,291 --> 01:02:48,583
Oh God, you didn't save it at all.

1135
01:02:52,083 --> 01:02:54,916
Heavy strong. Everything is saved.

1136
01:02:55,708 --> 01:02:58,958
By the way, when you go
tomorrow wear this and go.

1137
01:02:59,875 --> 01:03:01,041
What?

1138
01:03:01,083 --> 01:03:03,375
These are mine? Hey, Ria.

1139
01:03:08,958 --> 01:03:12,708
'We have been kept as
trapped for so long.'

1140
01:03:13,750 --> 01:03:15,791
'You have seen it and we
have seen it as well.'

1141
01:03:16,458 --> 01:03:19,875
And yet, we are sitting
with our eyes closed. Why?

1142
01:03:20,208 --> 01:03:21,416
In fear.

1143
01:03:21,541 --> 01:03:23,416
'She said something about an
assembly.' - The owner have been..

1144
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:25,416
'Then I am sure she is inside.'
- They have tied a cloth.

1145
01:03:25,708 --> 01:03:27,125
So that, despite having eyes..

1146
01:03:27,208 --> 01:03:29,041
..you cannot see the real truth.

1147
01:03:29,416 --> 01:03:31,833
'I am sure a man whose name is
Shyamal Dutta is an old man.'

1148
01:03:32,625 --> 01:03:34,041
According to me, it
is my responsibility..

1149
01:03:34,125 --> 01:03:36,541
..that all of you should
remain quiet.. - Brother.

1150
01:03:36,625 --> 01:03:37,833
Is your name Shyamal Dutta?

1151
01:03:37,916 --> 01:03:39,916
No, dear. My name is Anik Rai.

1152
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:43,250
In everything, you
follow their command. Why?

1153
01:03:43,583 --> 01:03:45,375
Even you must be having
a personal opinion. Right?

1154
01:03:45,458 --> 01:03:47,500
Brother. Are you Shyamal Dutta?

1155
01:03:47,583 --> 01:03:50,666
No.
- What are we getting? What? Nothing.

1156
01:03:51,416 --> 01:03:53,916
I, your union leader..

1157
01:03:54,208 --> 01:03:56,833
I am telling you that all
of you are making a mistake.

1158
01:03:57,583 --> 01:04:00,166
And that is the reason
it is my responsibility..

1159
01:04:00,208 --> 01:04:02,125
..to improve your mistake.

1160
01:04:02,708 --> 01:04:05,416
Don't you have your opinion?
- Brother? - Yes.

1161
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:07,708
Are you Shyamal Dutta?
- No. - I am telling you again.

1162
01:04:07,791 --> 01:04:10,458
Each one of you, except yourselves..

1163
01:04:10,541 --> 01:04:11,916
Who are they? What are they?

1164
01:04:12,541 --> 01:04:14,041
They are nothing.
- 'I hope it is not the man..

1165
01:04:14,125 --> 01:04:16,541
..who is delivering the lecture.'
- I am your union leader..

1166
01:04:16,625 --> 01:04:20,541
..Ramkrishna Pal, give you
my word while standing here..

1167
01:04:20,625 --> 01:04:24,833
..that all of you will get
your respective rights back.

1168
01:04:25,291 --> 01:04:27,750
Bonus. What have we asked for?

1169
01:04:28,666 --> 01:04:32,541
We have asked for bonus. 8.33%.

1170
01:04:33,541 --> 01:04:35,583
I have been seeing that you have
been shifting chairs since a long time.

1171
01:04:35,666 --> 01:04:36,750
What is your intention?

1172
01:04:37,083 --> 01:04:38,666
Trust me, sir. I
don't have any intention.

1173
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:40,375
I am looking for
someone called Shyamal Dutta.

1174
01:04:40,458 --> 01:04:41,875
This is your primary right.

1175
01:04:41,958 --> 01:04:43,375
Do you know Shyamal Dutta?

1176
01:04:43,458 --> 01:04:44,916
No, sir, I don't know anyone.

1177
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,875
I mean, I was told by Ria.. There
is a girl called Ria.. sent me here.

1178
01:04:47,958 --> 01:04:49,041
Is one month's salary..
- Ria? - Is that right? - Yes.

1179
01:04:49,125 --> 01:04:50,375
Are we asking for a lot?

1180
01:04:50,750 --> 01:04:53,916
The whole of India..
- Go and sit in the tea shop outside.

1181
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,083
In every factory and college..
- I will send Mr. Shyamal.

1182
01:04:56,166 --> 01:04:57,291
Yes.
- Go.

1183
01:04:57,375 --> 01:04:59,125
They have made a union..
-Thank you, sir.

1184
01:04:59,458 --> 01:05:01,625
Just except this institution.

1185
01:05:02,416 --> 01:05:04,916
Got it? You don't have a
reason to feel scared.

1186
01:05:05,166 --> 01:05:08,000
Just remember. 8.33%..
- Sit down.

1187
01:05:08,083 --> 01:05:11,125
No, sir, it is fine.
- It is our due.. - Sit down.

1188
01:05:11,250 --> 01:05:15,125
As long as the millionaires and
the owners.. -What is your name?

1189
01:05:15,458 --> 01:05:18,125
Noor Islam. - Till that time,
our fight and our revolution..

1190
01:05:18,166 --> 01:05:19,666
Tell me the details.
- What?

1191
01:05:19,791 --> 01:05:21,541
I hope..
- I stay here.

1192
01:05:21,625 --> 01:05:23,708
Yes, I work in a leather factory.

1193
01:05:23,750 --> 01:05:26,291
Good job. I get 6000
as salary in a month.

1194
01:05:26,833 --> 01:05:29,541
And actual residence?
- Shibpur. At Murshidabad.

1195
01:05:29,625 --> 01:05:32,833
I know. All the boys from
there go to Kolkata for work.

1196
01:05:33,083 --> 01:05:34,250
But you have come here?

1197
01:05:34,416 --> 01:05:37,125
Sir, my mother feels
that if I go to Kolkata..

1198
01:05:37,250 --> 01:05:38,416
..I will become wayward.

1199
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,125
Thank you, sir, I don't smoke.

1200
01:05:42,291 --> 01:05:43,416
You don't?
- No.

1201
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:44,666
Good.

1202
01:05:44,958 --> 01:05:46,041
Hey, give me two cups of tea.

1203
01:05:46,291 --> 01:05:47,583
Sir, I don't have tea as well.

1204
01:05:48,208 --> 01:05:49,375
You don't have tea as well?
- No.

1205
01:05:50,125 --> 01:05:51,708
Then do you have milk?
- Yes.

1206
01:05:54,208 --> 01:05:55,583
One tea and one cup of milk.

1207
01:05:58,708 --> 01:06:00,208
Sir, Shyamal Dutta hasn't come.

1208
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:03,750
I am Shyamal Dutta.

1209
01:06:12,208 --> 01:06:13,958
Did you meet him?
- Yes.

1210
01:06:14,250 --> 01:06:15,333
What did he say?

1211
01:06:15,416 --> 01:06:16,666
He offered me a glass of milk.

1212
01:06:16,958 --> 01:06:18,250
He offered milk?
- Yes.

1213
01:06:19,666 --> 01:06:21,125
And you had it?
- No..

1214
01:06:21,583 --> 01:06:23,458
Yes.
- Do you know who he is?

1215
01:06:23,541 --> 01:06:25,166
Yes, you had told me the name.
He is Shyamal Dutta.

1216
01:06:26,041 --> 01:06:28,708
I didn't ask you his name.
Do you know who he is?

1217
01:06:28,791 --> 01:06:30,625
Yes.. If he is a
police officer for me..

1218
01:06:30,708 --> 01:06:32,250
..I am sure he is
police commissioner for you.

1219
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,375
Are you joking?
Shyamal Dutta is my father.

1220
01:06:35,708 --> 01:06:37,583
What? Hey, why didn't you
tell me earlier that you are..

1221
01:06:37,666 --> 01:06:39,041
..the daughter of a cop? - Why?
If you would have known earlier..

1222
01:06:39,125 --> 01:06:40,208
..you wouldn't have
fallen in love with me..

1223
01:06:40,291 --> 01:06:41,458
..or waved your hands
at me from the terrace?

1224
01:06:41,583 --> 01:06:43,041
Yes, I would have and waved as well.

1225
01:06:43,125 --> 01:06:45,000
But.. You should have told me earlier.

1226
01:06:45,083 --> 01:06:46,541
What did you tell him about us?

1227
01:06:46,708 --> 01:06:47,791
Mad? Does anyone say anything?

1228
01:06:47,875 --> 01:06:49,000
I have told him.
- What?

1229
01:06:49,125 --> 01:06:51,375
Now you go and ask him
about what he has to say.

1230
01:06:51,458 --> 01:06:53,041
Again?
- Yes, you will go there again.

1231
01:06:53,958 --> 01:06:56,041
But by now, the assembly is over.
- I know.

1232
01:06:57,291 --> 01:06:58,833
I know that the assembly is over.

1233
01:06:58,875 --> 01:07:00,583
Go to the police station.
You will find him there.

1234
01:07:00,875 --> 01:07:02,541
Police station?
- Go.

1235
01:07:02,958 --> 01:07:05,041
You can make a note in the
diary if you want to, mister.

1236
01:07:05,750 --> 01:07:07,041
It will go to the court
and a case will be made.

1237
01:07:07,125 --> 01:07:08,416
And it will go on for very long.

1238
01:07:08,708 --> 01:07:10,708
You will have to pay the fees and
there will be a lot of expenditure.

1239
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:12,833
Rather than that, do something.

1240
01:07:12,958 --> 01:07:15,000
Sit with each other
and settle the matter.

1241
01:07:15,166 --> 01:07:16,250
Got it?
- Yes.

1242
01:07:16,333 --> 01:07:17,541
And there is nothing here.

1243
01:07:17,708 --> 01:07:19,041
Hey..
- What are you doing here?

1244
01:07:19,125 --> 01:07:20,500
Settle it between yourselves.
- No. Nothing has happened.

1245
01:07:20,583 --> 01:07:22,083
What is it now? Go then.
- Yes, it is okay, sir.

1246
01:07:22,166 --> 01:07:24,750
Look at him. He was peeping
from the door. What is the matter?

1247
01:07:24,833 --> 01:07:25,958
Yes.

1248
01:07:27,375 --> 01:07:28,500
What do you want?

1249
01:07:28,583 --> 01:07:30,833
Yes.. No, sir, I mean..

1250
01:07:30,916 --> 01:07:32,500
Ria asked me to ask you..

1251
01:07:32,583 --> 01:07:34,291
..about what you want to say about us?

1252
01:07:34,583 --> 01:07:36,541
I will talk to Ria about this at home.

1253
01:07:37,041 --> 01:07:38,125
Yes..

1254
01:07:38,750 --> 01:07:40,166
I was telling you..
- Sir.

1255
01:07:40,250 --> 01:07:42,833
Did you understand anything
of what I said for so long?

1256
01:07:42,916 --> 01:07:45,541
Yes, sir.
- Go home and think with a calm head.

1257
01:07:45,958 --> 01:07:48,000
And even after that if you
feel like filing a case..

1258
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:50,500
What happened now?

1259
01:07:50,833 --> 01:07:53,041
No, I mean, if I don't
go back with an answer..

1260
01:07:53,083 --> 01:07:54,791
..Ria will send me back again.

1261
01:08:00,791 --> 01:08:03,791
No, no, I will listen
to whatever you say.

1262
01:08:03,875 --> 01:08:05,500
Okay, I am leaving. I am leaving.

1263
01:08:07,541 --> 01:08:08,750
No.. I am leaving.

1264
01:08:12,041 --> 01:08:13,125
Sorry, sorry.

1265
01:08:18,041 --> 01:08:20,708
I met the boy and I
spoke to him as well.

1266
01:08:20,791 --> 01:08:25,291
I think it would be better if we
don't go ahead with this. - Why?

1267
01:08:25,916 --> 01:08:27,083
Why should I not go ahead?

1268
01:08:27,375 --> 01:08:28,958
Neither does the boy
look good or something..

1269
01:08:29,291 --> 01:08:31,125
..and even his job is not too..
- And?

1270
01:08:32,125 --> 01:08:33,250
Muslim.

1271
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:35,041
That is the real problem. Right?

1272
01:08:35,375 --> 01:08:38,375
Whatever is it, don't
think about this anymore.

1273
01:08:41,625 --> 01:08:42,750
Mother, please.

1274
01:08:44,041 --> 01:08:45,833
Hey, take the offerings.

1275
01:08:47,041 --> 01:08:49,375
Yes, brother. The stuff has gone.

1276
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,166
Yes. I have loaded it myself.

1277
01:08:52,458 --> 01:08:54,416
Hey, it will reach by tomorrow.

1278
01:08:55,083 --> 01:08:57,291
Yes, yes. Now don't worry at all.

1279
01:08:57,875 --> 01:09:00,041
No, no, no, it will reach. It
will reach. Yes.. Hey, wait, wait.

1280
01:09:00,666 --> 01:09:02,375
No, no, not to you. I
will talk to you later.

1281
01:09:03,958 --> 01:09:05,125
What is the matter, Noor?

1282
01:09:05,916 --> 01:09:08,041
These days, without informing,
you are taking leaves.

1283
01:09:08,125 --> 01:09:09,458
And you are leaving
whenever you feel like.

1284
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:11,666
I don't understand the
matter with you, brother.

1285
01:09:12,083 --> 01:09:13,583
You were not like this earlier.

1286
01:09:13,708 --> 01:09:16,291
I wouldn't repeat this,
brother. Work is everything for me.

1287
01:09:16,791 --> 01:09:18,541
From now, I will work with attention.

1288
01:09:18,625 --> 01:09:19,750
Okay, go.

1289
01:09:28,708 --> 01:09:29,833
Noor.

1290
01:09:31,791 --> 01:09:32,958
Noor.

1291
01:09:33,958 --> 01:09:35,083
Noor.

1292
01:09:35,333 --> 01:09:37,333
Someone is here to meet you.

1293
01:09:48,291 --> 01:09:49,416
What are you doing here?

1294
01:09:49,833 --> 01:09:51,875
Take a leave today.
- What?

1295
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,125
What?

1296
01:09:56,250 --> 01:09:59,416
He is our manager.
- So?

1297
01:10:00,791 --> 01:10:01,958
What should I do?

1298
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,625
Listen, I will give you an address.

1299
01:10:03,958 --> 01:10:05,500
Wear new clothes and go there.

1300
01:10:05,583 --> 01:10:07,291
And meet someone called Raghav.

1301
01:10:28,875 --> 01:10:31,000
Hey, will you be able
to win this game today?

1302
01:10:31,083 --> 01:10:33,000
Hey, I played such a nice
shot yesterday, teacher.

1303
01:10:35,125 --> 01:10:36,625
Who is Raghav amongst you, brother?

1304
01:10:38,708 --> 01:10:40,625
I am Raghav. What happened?

1305
01:10:41,291 --> 01:10:43,333
I needed to talk to you
about something important.

1306
01:10:43,833 --> 01:10:44,916
Can you play carom?

1307
01:10:45,250 --> 01:10:46,375
Yes.

1308
01:10:48,750 --> 01:10:49,916
Throw this coin and show me.

1309
01:10:52,708 --> 01:10:53,833
Tell me.

1310
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:56,666
Ria has sent me.

1311
01:10:57,916 --> 01:10:59,541
Ria has sent you?
- Yes.

1312
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:02,208
Hey..
- Yes? - All of you can play.

1313
01:11:02,541 --> 01:11:03,666
Hey, come on..
- Hey, whose turn was it?

1314
01:11:03,750 --> 01:11:05,208
Hey, leave it.
- Let us start a new game.

1315
01:11:05,291 --> 01:11:06,375
Now we wouldn't play.. -Tell me.

1316
01:11:06,458 --> 01:11:07,583
Why has Ria sent you?
- Show me the next move.

1317
01:11:07,666 --> 01:11:09,583
How are you related to Ria?
- My name is Noor.

1318
01:11:09,666 --> 01:11:12,625
I stay in Murshidabad Shibpur and
I work at a leather factory here.

1319
01:11:12,708 --> 01:11:13,916
And get 6000 as salary.

1320
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,541
It is your turn.. - So what
should I do with all these details?

1321
01:11:15,583 --> 01:11:17,416
Why has Ria sent you here?
How are you related to Ria?

1322
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:19,958
No, no, Ria has told me that
you need to know about all this.

1323
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,583
As Ria and I love each other.

1324
01:11:22,291 --> 01:11:23,500
Hey, fool!

1325
01:11:39,625 --> 01:11:40,708
Hey, Ria.

1326
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,458
Hey..
- Hey!

1327
01:11:59,541 --> 01:12:01,416
What are you doing.. - Hey, what is
this? Why are you driving so rash?

1328
01:12:03,083 --> 01:12:04,250
Hey, why are you driving like that..

1329
01:12:04,333 --> 01:12:05,583
Hey, drive slowly.
Hey, what are you doing?

1330
01:12:11,833 --> 01:12:14,041
Hey..
- Hey, drive slower. Drive slower.

1331
01:12:41,833 --> 01:12:44,625
"Twinkle, twinkle.."
- No, dear, don't do that.

1332
01:12:44,708 --> 01:12:46,833
Sleep for sometime..
- Yes, brother, I am coming.

1333
01:12:46,916 --> 01:12:48,666
No, no, no, no.

1334
01:12:48,750 --> 01:12:51,125
Even you have been awake for a
long time. You go off to sleep.

1335
01:12:51,208 --> 01:12:53,541
My dear, please don't
do that. Please sleep.

1336
01:12:53,625 --> 01:12:54,750
How was your interview..
- It was good.

1337
01:13:20,541 --> 01:13:21,833
Hey, he is the same man.

1338
01:13:21,916 --> 01:13:24,000
And she thought that her bags..

1339
01:13:24,083 --> 01:13:25,875
Her bags were stolen. I am going.

1340
01:13:30,208 --> 01:13:31,416
Sorry.

1341
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,125
That is it.

1342
01:13:33,458 --> 01:13:35,041
Whatever it is, I am a
stranger in the city.

1343
01:13:35,125 --> 01:13:36,750
Tea. Tea.

1344
01:13:39,416 --> 01:13:40,750
I said I am sorry.

1345
01:13:43,291 --> 01:13:44,416
Are you hungry?

1346
01:13:45,583 --> 01:13:47,500
Look, I always have
breakfast by nine in the morning..

1347
01:13:47,583 --> 01:13:49,041
..and have lunch by 1.30.

1348
01:13:49,916 --> 01:13:52,083
Now it is almost 3 and I
haven't had either of both.

1349
01:13:53,833 --> 01:13:55,000
Can I eat something?

1350
01:13:58,208 --> 01:14:00,583
Don't girls of Kolkata cook at home?

1351
01:14:01,166 --> 01:14:02,875
Even the boys of
Kolkata do. Why? Tell me.

1352
01:14:03,125 --> 01:14:05,291
In that case, why have
they come here to eat?

1353
01:14:06,125 --> 01:14:07,625
This is their workplace.
Once they come here..

1354
01:14:07,666 --> 01:14:08,875
..they don't know when
they will go back home.

1355
01:14:08,958 --> 01:14:11,000
And one can get everything here.
Whatever one may need.

1356
01:14:11,833 --> 01:14:15,500
And hence, this becomes their
home and their world. Everything.

1357
01:14:16,583 --> 01:14:18,916
Do you have stew?
- Yes, I do. - What will you have?

1358
01:14:19,708 --> 01:14:20,791
One minute.

1359
01:14:30,416 --> 01:14:32,708
The dot has moved.
- What?

1360
01:14:32,875 --> 01:14:34,083
The dot on the forehead has moved.

1361
01:14:45,250 --> 01:14:47,541
Tell me, what will you have? I
am having chicken stew and bread.

1362
01:14:47,625 --> 01:14:48,708
You?

1363
01:14:49,708 --> 01:14:51,833
Mother says that on a good day,
one mustn't have non-vegetarian.

1364
01:14:52,083 --> 01:14:53,458
It is the interview day today.

1365
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,333
I got it. You will
have vegetarian food.

1366
01:14:57,625 --> 01:14:59,666
Right?
- Rice and curry.

1367
01:15:02,333 --> 01:15:04,250
You won't get that here now.

1368
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:06,666
Say something easy. Peas?

1369
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,125
It has onion.

1370
01:15:08,875 --> 01:15:10,291
Chapattis and potato curry.

1371
01:15:10,458 --> 01:15:11,958
The same. Onion.

1372
01:15:13,750 --> 01:15:16,500
They make good vegetables in
that shop. Let us go there.

1373
01:15:16,875 --> 01:15:18,083
They have touched chicken.

1374
01:15:19,541 --> 01:15:21,458
Will you have fruits?
- On an empty stomach?

1375
01:15:21,541 --> 01:15:23,250
Bread and butter?

1376
01:15:23,791 --> 01:15:24,916
Yes.

1377
01:15:25,416 --> 01:15:26,583
Give it.

1378
01:15:31,625 --> 01:15:32,750
Here you are.

1379
01:15:46,333 --> 01:15:47,791
Now we have to go to sister's house.

1380
01:15:49,416 --> 01:15:50,583
What do you mean by we?

1381
01:15:51,166 --> 01:15:53,083
I mean, since you
have helped me so much..

1382
01:15:53,208 --> 01:15:54,791
..you can take me to sister's house..

1383
01:15:56,166 --> 01:15:57,291
Where is your sister's house?

1384
01:15:57,375 --> 01:15:59,833
That is what she said.
Salt Lake. CI Lines.

1385
01:16:00,708 --> 01:16:02,083
Okay, come on, we
need to take an auto.

1386
01:16:02,625 --> 01:16:03,666
Come on.

1387
01:16:07,250 --> 01:16:08,791
Are you still scared?

1388
01:16:10,458 --> 01:16:13,791
Actually I couldn't
trust you for all this while.

1389
01:16:13,875 --> 01:16:15,000
That is why I wasn't scared as well.

1390
01:16:16,291 --> 01:16:18,958
Now I trust you a little.

1391
01:16:19,916 --> 01:16:21,166
That is why I am scared.

1392
01:16:25,416 --> 01:16:26,541
Bus.

1393
01:16:32,833 --> 01:16:34,583
What? Oh no.
- What is it?

1394
01:16:35,750 --> 01:16:36,875
This is my office bus.

1395
01:16:39,833 --> 01:16:40,958
It is gone.

1396
01:16:44,916 --> 01:16:46,500
Hey, come on, come on. Just
because you haven't gone to office..

1397
01:16:46,583 --> 01:16:48,166
..doesn't mean you cannot
get up on the office bus.

1398
01:16:48,208 --> 01:16:50,541
Hey, his legs are paining.
How will he come?

1399
01:16:50,625 --> 01:16:52,750
She is calling you.. - His pain of
the legs has come up to his stomach.

1400
01:16:52,833 --> 01:16:54,416
Come up..
- Come on, come on.

1401
01:16:54,500 --> 01:16:55,625
Come up, come up.

1402
01:17:03,250 --> 01:17:05,458
Move..
- Hey, sit here.

1403
01:17:13,916 --> 01:17:15,166
Nice.

1404
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:17,625
Call him.

1405
01:17:18,916 --> 01:17:20,208
They are calling you from behind.

1406
01:17:26,583 --> 01:17:27,833
What have you started? Tell me.

1407
01:17:28,291 --> 01:17:29,583
It is not what you think it is.

1408
01:17:30,166 --> 01:17:32,500
Hey, I went to the bus
stand to drop brother-in-law.

1409
01:17:33,291 --> 01:17:35,041
The poor one has come to
Kolkata for the first time.

1410
01:17:35,125 --> 01:17:37,125
She doesn't know her way around.
And all of you have..

1411
01:17:37,875 --> 01:17:39,750
Okay, you went to drop brother-in-law.

1412
01:17:39,916 --> 01:17:41,250
So I am sure you took your bike.

1413
01:17:41,750 --> 01:17:47,166
Oh no, I have left my bike behind.
Will I get it if I go now?

1414
01:17:47,250 --> 01:17:48,875
Hey, nothing will happen. If I
had a girl like that with me..

1415
01:17:48,958 --> 01:17:50,500
..even I would have
left my bike behind.

1416
01:17:50,708 --> 01:17:52,708
Friends, is the bike
first or the girl?

1417
01:17:52,791 --> 01:17:54,041
Of course, the girl is first.

1418
01:17:55,791 --> 01:17:57,875
Hey, call her.

1419
01:17:58,208 --> 01:17:59,958
What is the need?
- Call her.

1420
01:18:01,791 --> 01:18:03,291
She is calling you.
- What?

1421
01:18:04,208 --> 01:18:05,375
He is a very nice boy.

1422
01:18:05,458 --> 01:18:07,541
In the last two years, I
have proposed to him..

1423
01:18:07,625 --> 01:18:09,250
..hundred times, in hundred ways
and in hundred different languages.

1424
01:18:09,333 --> 01:18:11,458
What are you doing?
- But he didn't pay attention.

1425
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:16,458
He is my colleague. He took
pity on me and married me.

1426
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:18,458
He is my Mr. Helper.

1427
01:18:28,625 --> 01:18:30,375
Drop her safely.
- Thank you, friends.

1428
01:18:30,458 --> 01:18:31,791
Bye. Go home early.
- Go now.

1429
01:18:31,875 --> 01:18:33,291
Bye, bye. We will meet
at the office tomorrow.

1430
01:18:33,916 --> 01:18:37,916
Hey, I forgot to ask you.
How was your interview today?

1431
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:39,625
It was good.

1432
01:18:39,833 --> 01:18:42,916
But they will not keep me in Kolkata.
They will send me to Chennai.

1433
01:18:43,041 --> 01:18:44,250
I declined.

1434
01:18:44,625 --> 01:18:48,625
That is good. You mustn't go
to an unknown city to work.

1435
01:18:49,208 --> 01:18:51,458
The experience that you had on
coming to Kolkata for the first time.

1436
01:18:54,125 --> 01:18:56,250
We have come to CI Line. Now
where is your sister's house?

1437
01:18:56,333 --> 01:18:57,416
What is the address?
- What?

1438
01:18:58,958 --> 01:19:02,333
Sister's house? I mean..
She had told me.

1439
01:19:04,166 --> 01:19:06,625
I have forgotten.
What will happen now?

1440
01:19:07,666 --> 01:19:10,666
Give her a call and ask
for the address. - Yes.

1441
01:19:10,958 --> 01:19:12,083
Hey, no.

1442
01:19:12,458 --> 01:19:14,166
You call only from a booth.

1443
01:19:14,875 --> 01:19:16,125
Come on, we will look for a booth.

1444
01:19:21,166 --> 01:19:23,333
Hello?
- Hello, sister. - Yes.

1445
01:19:23,583 --> 01:19:25,000
The place you had told me about..

1446
01:19:25,291 --> 01:19:26,708
CI lane.

1447
01:19:27,083 --> 01:19:28,250
I am there.

1448
01:19:28,333 --> 01:19:32,125
Yes, do something. Ask
someone for City center.

1449
01:19:32,208 --> 01:19:33,666
Walk towards the city center.

1450
01:19:33,750 --> 01:19:35,958
If you come ahead a little you
will see house on the right side.

1451
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,375
And the name of that
is Purulia Bhawan.

1452
01:19:37,458 --> 01:19:38,916
And when you come ahead
of Purulia Bhawan a bit..

1453
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,125
..you will..
- Sister, I..

1454
01:19:40,208 --> 01:19:42,666
On the left side, there is a lane.
- I didn't understand anything.

1455
01:19:43,458 --> 01:19:45,416
Okay, wait for sometime. I am
giving the phone to him. Okay?

1456
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:46,625
One minute. One minute.

1457
01:19:50,958 --> 01:19:53,458
Sister. Can you please talk to her?

1458
01:19:59,583 --> 01:20:00,750
Hello.

1459
01:20:02,583 --> 01:20:03,750
Okay, fine.

1460
01:20:07,958 --> 01:20:09,125
Come on.

1461
01:20:09,333 --> 01:20:10,750
You got it already?

1462
01:20:11,458 --> 01:20:14,583
She was giving you directions.
She just told me the address.

1463
01:20:15,291 --> 01:20:16,333
Come on.

1464
01:20:16,875 --> 01:20:18,083
One minute.

1465
01:20:20,416 --> 01:20:24,333
Brother. Two big chocolates.

1466
01:20:24,458 --> 01:20:25,708
And..

1467
01:20:27,291 --> 01:20:29,708
One King. -What King?

1468
01:20:30,625 --> 01:20:31,791
King, right?

1469
01:20:33,208 --> 01:20:35,166
A big Gold flake. One.
- Gold flake.

1470
01:20:44,750 --> 01:20:45,833
This is the one.

1471
01:20:57,875 --> 01:20:59,750
Hey, Joi. You are here?
- Sister.

1472
01:21:02,541 --> 01:21:04,500
Oh, I see. So he is the one?

1473
01:21:04,583 --> 01:21:07,166
According to your brief,
everything matches.

1474
01:21:07,250 --> 01:21:09,583
Shirt and pant. And he
is quite tall as well.

1475
01:21:09,750 --> 01:21:12,083
And to an extent of the
scar of his cheek as well.

1476
01:21:12,541 --> 01:21:14,708
But there is something that
doesn't match. - Keep quiet.

1477
01:21:15,875 --> 01:21:18,250
He doesn't look doubtful at all.

1478
01:21:18,791 --> 01:21:22,041
At the first glance, I know. I
can trust him with closed eyes.

1479
01:21:22,833 --> 01:21:26,416
No, actually that
was earlier.. I mean..

1480
01:21:27,708 --> 01:21:29,250
By mistake..
- I see.

1481
01:21:29,541 --> 01:21:32,458
Actually she couldn't
trust you at the beginning.

1482
01:21:32,666 --> 01:21:35,666
Why? Just because I am a
stranger from the city?

1483
01:21:35,750 --> 01:21:39,083
Look, please don't mind. This
is a lot like the conception.

1484
01:21:39,458 --> 01:21:40,833
Just because someone is a politician,
he has to be bad.

1485
01:21:41,625 --> 01:21:44,541
I agree that some
people of my city are bad.

1486
01:21:44,916 --> 01:21:46,333
But the others are good.

1487
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:48,208
Just because of some bad people..

1488
01:21:48,333 --> 01:21:49,625
..why should the others be blamed?

1489
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:52,625
I know I love my city a bit too much.

1490
01:21:52,708 --> 01:21:54,583
Ultimate Kolkata is my own city.

1491
01:21:54,875 --> 01:21:58,625
Balughat is my town.
- And this house is mine.

1492
01:21:59,208 --> 01:22:02,125
And should I not offer one
cup of tea to the person..

1493
01:22:02,208 --> 01:22:04,375
..who has helped my sister so much?

1494
01:22:04,458 --> 01:22:06,791
Please come in.
- No, I cannot do so today. Actually..

1495
01:22:07,416 --> 01:22:09,208
My bike..

1496
01:22:09,708 --> 01:22:12,708
If I go after this, I will have to
collect it from the police station.

1497
01:22:12,833 --> 01:22:14,333
Some other time..
- Okay.

1498
01:22:14,750 --> 01:22:16,875
But the next time you come,
you have to come in.

1499
01:22:19,541 --> 01:22:22,166
Oh no, I think the cat has
come to the kitchen again.

1500
01:22:22,333 --> 01:22:24,333
I am going. Okay? Joi. Come.

1501
01:22:24,416 --> 01:22:25,541
I am leaving.

1502
01:22:34,416 --> 01:22:38,083
Bye. - Can I say something?
But you wouldn't mind.

1503
01:22:39,916 --> 01:22:43,375
Tell me. - I am saying something.
You can call it an advice as well.

1504
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:46,916
If you meet a girl at the
bus stand some other time..

1505
01:22:47,125 --> 01:22:49,916
..don't make the mistake of
wasting an entire day, bunking office..

1506
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,708
..wasting a leave and
leaving your bike behind.

1507
01:22:53,750 --> 01:22:56,625
Don't be so good. Just
become a little clever.

1508
01:22:58,875 --> 01:23:00,000
As you say, boss.

1509
01:23:01,541 --> 01:23:02,666
I am leaving.

1510
01:23:05,708 --> 01:23:07,708
Come to my house if
you come to Balurghat.

1511
01:23:09,666 --> 01:23:12,458
I owe you a favor. I
will repay it with interest.

1512
01:23:13,250 --> 01:23:15,083
I will come to Balurghat? Okay.

1513
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:18,625
If I ever come, it will be
enough if you repay the favor.

1514
01:23:19,125 --> 01:23:20,375
I don't need the interest.

1515
01:23:27,458 --> 01:23:31,291
"Someone showed me a glimpse
even when I asked for a little."

1516
01:23:32,833 --> 01:23:35,958
"There are some stories that
went flowing with the breeze."

1517
01:23:48,166 --> 01:23:50,916
"Someone showed me a glimpse
even when I asked for a little."

1518
01:23:51,208 --> 01:23:53,625
"There are some stories that
went flowing with the breeze."

1519
01:23:53,916 --> 01:23:58,666
"And I am roaming around without a
reason and floating with pride."

1520
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,375
"What is his name? I have no idea."

1521
01:24:01,458 --> 01:24:03,833
"My days are going by."

1522
01:24:03,916 --> 01:24:08,500
"What is this new tune
that is playing in my mind?"

1523
01:24:08,583 --> 01:24:10,375
"He is in my imagination."

1524
01:24:10,458 --> 01:24:11,708
"He is in my imagination."

1525
01:24:11,791 --> 01:24:13,750
"He is always entangled."

1526
01:24:13,833 --> 01:24:16,833
"On lonely nights and restless days."

1527
01:24:16,916 --> 01:24:18,833
"He is always present."

1528
01:24:18,958 --> 01:24:24,166
"Lover. Now I cannot
sleep without you any more."

1529
01:24:24,250 --> 01:24:29,125
"Lover. Now I cannot stay spend
my nights without you any more."

1530
01:24:29,166 --> 01:24:34,416
"Lover. Now I cannot
sleep without you any more."

1531
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:41,041
"Lover. Now I cannot stay spend
my nights without you any more."

1532
01:25:01,166 --> 01:25:03,416
"He is like cricket at night."

1533
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:06,083
"He is burning and
vanishing at nights."

1534
01:25:06,291 --> 01:25:08,541
"I am feeling sad without you."

1535
01:25:08,625 --> 01:25:11,166
"I have written in a
letter and sent it to you."

1536
01:25:11,250 --> 01:25:13,750
"He is like cricket at night."

1537
01:25:13,833 --> 01:25:16,416
"He is burning and
vanishing at nights."

1538
01:25:16,708 --> 01:25:18,958
"I am feeling sad without you."

1539
01:25:19,041 --> 01:25:21,916
"I have written in a
letter and sent it to you."

1540
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,583
"Through the rain,
sunshine comes across."

1541
01:25:24,625 --> 01:25:26,625
"And there is moisture in the air."

1542
01:25:26,708 --> 01:25:29,750
"On the dark nights.
On nights of wishes."

1543
01:25:29,833 --> 01:25:31,583
"Come to me."

1544
01:25:31,666 --> 01:25:37,250
"Lover. Now I cannot
sleep without you any more."

1545
01:25:37,333 --> 01:25:42,083
"Lover. Now I cannot stay spend
my nights without you any more."

1546
01:25:42,166 --> 01:25:47,333
"Lover. Now I cannot
sleep without you any more."

1547
01:25:47,416 --> 01:25:53,875
"Lover. Now I cannot stay spend
my nights without you any more."

1548
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:18,041
Hey!
- Hey!

1549
01:26:25,125 --> 01:26:27,333
"On the pillow. In the nail polish."

1550
01:26:27,416 --> 01:26:29,916
"My heart is
constantly thinking of you."

1551
01:26:30,208 --> 01:26:32,500
"There is sadness in my heart."

1552
01:26:32,583 --> 01:26:35,500
"I have become helpless in love."

1553
01:26:35,583 --> 01:26:37,708
"On the pillow. In the nail polish."

1554
01:26:37,791 --> 01:26:40,333
"My heart is
constantly thinking of you."

1555
01:26:40,666 --> 01:26:42,958
"There is sadness in my heart."

1556
01:26:43,041 --> 01:26:45,541
"I have become helpless in love."

1557
01:26:45,625 --> 01:26:50,541
"He is entangled in the loud
sounds and thundering of my heart."

1558
01:26:50,750 --> 01:26:56,125
"He is entangled in the lonely
nights and the restless days."

1559
01:26:56,541 --> 01:26:59,000
"Someone showed a glimpse
to me in a slight shade."

1560
01:26:59,250 --> 01:27:01,583
"Some stories are
floating in the air."

1561
01:27:01,875 --> 01:27:06,416
"Without a reason, I am slightly
hurt and walking away in pride."

1562
01:27:07,083 --> 01:27:09,375
"I am only thinking of him."

1563
01:27:09,708 --> 01:27:12,000
"I am leading my life
in an unorganized way."

1564
01:27:12,208 --> 01:27:16,708
"There is an unknown
tune playing in my heart."

1565
01:27:16,791 --> 01:27:18,458
"It is putting me to sleep."

1566
01:27:18,541 --> 01:27:21,583
"He is entangled in my
pain and imagination."

1567
01:27:21,875 --> 01:27:26,875
"On lonely nights and
restless days, he is entangled."

1568
01:27:26,958 --> 01:27:31,958
"Lover, I cannot sleep
without you anymore."

1569
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:37,125
"Lover, I cannot spend my
nights without you anymore."

1570
01:27:37,208 --> 01:27:42,333
"Lover, I cannot sleep
without you anymore."

1571
01:27:42,416 --> 01:27:48,583
"Lover, I cannot spend my
nights without you anymore."

1572
01:28:01,083 --> 01:28:04,958
"Twinkle, twinkle, little star.
How I wonder what you are.."

1573
01:28:05,041 --> 01:28:07,875
Hello. What are you doing?

1574
01:28:08,125 --> 01:28:10,416
You are eating. Are
you going off to sleep?

1575
01:28:10,625 --> 01:28:14,916
Yes, dear, I will be there shortly.
I am really coming.

1576
01:28:15,125 --> 01:28:16,416
You don't trust me, right?

1577
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:20,041
Okay, okay, there is a
grandfather next to me. Ask him.

1578
01:28:20,125 --> 01:28:21,291
Wait, I will give the phone to him.

1579
01:28:22,750 --> 01:28:26,000
My daughter. Can you kindly tell
her that I am going back home?

1580
01:28:26,041 --> 01:28:27,625
She doesn't want to believe me at all.

1581
01:28:30,458 --> 01:28:31,750
Hello, dear?

1582
01:28:34,041 --> 01:28:37,583
Yes. Have you eaten?

1583
01:28:39,125 --> 01:28:41,833
He is not lying at all. What?

1584
01:28:42,625 --> 01:28:43,750
Toys?

1585
01:28:43,916 --> 01:28:45,541
Many toys. Many toys. Many of them.

1586
01:28:45,625 --> 01:28:49,083
Yes, he has brought
many toys. Big toys.

1587
01:28:49,541 --> 01:28:52,708
Wait for some time. Your
father will be home in some time.

1588
01:29:00,208 --> 01:29:02,000
"Be careful, my dear."

1589
01:29:02,083 --> 01:29:03,583
"Be careful, my dear."

1590
01:29:03,833 --> 01:29:05,791
"Be careful, my dear."

1591
01:29:05,875 --> 01:29:07,458
"All eyes are on you."

1592
01:29:09,125 --> 01:29:10,291
Hello.

1593
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,125
Yes, the address? Yes.

1594
01:29:13,666 --> 01:29:14,791
Hold for a second.

1595
01:29:17,041 --> 01:29:18,125
Do you have a pen?

1596
01:29:18,250 --> 01:29:19,625
What?
- A pen.

1597
01:29:19,833 --> 01:29:20,958
Pen?

1598
01:29:21,291 --> 01:29:22,833
Yes, when do I have to reach?

1599
01:29:22,916 --> 01:29:24,041
Tell me, tell me.
- Wait, brother, wait.

1600
01:29:24,333 --> 01:29:25,500
Wait please.

1601
01:29:26,625 --> 01:29:30,291
10? I will reach by ten.

1602
01:29:30,833 --> 01:29:33,666
No, no, I won't get late.
I will reach. Okay.

1603
01:29:35,541 --> 01:29:36,666
My pen.

1604
01:29:37,125 --> 01:29:38,291
Thank you.

1605
01:29:39,083 --> 01:29:41,833
Yes, tell me. Yes. Yes.

1606
01:29:41,875 --> 01:29:44,625
"DJ, turn it down. Down."

1607
01:29:54,500 --> 01:29:55,583
Oh no.

1608
01:29:57,666 --> 01:29:59,250
Oh no. Oh no. Oh my God.

1609
01:30:10,083 --> 01:30:12,625
Hey, listen. Hey, listen to me.

1610
01:30:17,291 --> 01:30:18,416
Hey, you..

1611
01:30:18,875 --> 01:30:20,791
You are Ali's son, right?

1612
01:30:20,916 --> 01:30:22,666
Yes? Oh yes.

1613
01:30:22,708 --> 01:30:24,708
Are you getting married to this girl?

1614
01:30:25,916 --> 01:30:27,750
I have heard everything from Ali.

1615
01:30:27,875 --> 01:30:29,625
All of this didn't
happen in our times.

1616
01:30:29,833 --> 01:30:31,416
But now, these things do happen.

1617
01:30:31,625 --> 01:30:34,125
But both of you should
stay happy and well.

1618
01:30:34,208 --> 01:30:37,583
This is my wish. And look,
let me tell you something.

1619
01:30:37,666 --> 01:30:41,333
Look after your parents.
They have done a lot for you.

1620
01:30:44,166 --> 01:30:46,083
Stay well, dear. Stay happy.

1621
01:30:58,500 --> 01:30:59,791
Make it quick, brother.

1622
01:31:01,333 --> 01:31:03,458
What happened?
- Hey, there has been a puncture.

1623
01:31:03,541 --> 01:31:04,625
Puncture?
- Where is it?

1624
01:31:04,833 --> 01:31:06,666
Wait, brother. Do
you have spare seats?

1625
01:31:06,791 --> 01:31:07,958
Wait, let me see.

1626
01:31:08,666 --> 01:31:09,791
Now I think I have around 4.

1627
01:31:09,958 --> 01:31:12,250
Stand a little ahead. Let
me see if someone wants it.

1628
01:31:12,333 --> 01:31:14,000
Hey, come on, come on,
come on, start the bus.

1629
01:31:14,791 --> 01:31:17,791
Hey, everyone who is in a
hurry can go by the other bus.

1630
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:19,375
There are four seats empty.

1631
01:31:19,791 --> 01:31:21,833
Hey, Bapi, make it quick.

1632
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:23,083
Give me the cigarette.

1633
01:31:23,916 --> 01:31:25,000
Listen, Mama. -Yes.

1634
01:31:25,083 --> 01:31:26,250
I am in a hurry. I am leaving. Okay?

1635
01:31:26,333 --> 01:31:27,750
Hey, wait, it will get
repaired right away.

1636
01:31:27,791 --> 01:31:30,250
No, I am leaving. Stay in
touch and do well. - Hey.

1637
01:31:30,416 --> 01:31:31,708
Change yourself. Don't do that.

1638
01:31:31,791 --> 01:31:32,916
Change yourself. I am leaving.

1639
01:31:34,666 --> 01:31:36,583
The man is just the same. Yes?
- Light.

1640
01:31:36,833 --> 01:31:38,000
I see.

1641
01:31:38,916 --> 01:31:41,291
Hey, come on, hey,
four, four, four, four.

1642
01:31:41,416 --> 01:31:42,875
Come on, come quickly.

1643
01:31:43,625 --> 01:31:45,125
Come on, come on,
come on. Get up quickly.

1644
01:31:46,291 --> 01:31:47,583
What? Hey!

1645
01:31:50,375 --> 01:31:51,500
Come on.

1646
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:54,500
Hey bus. Please stop.

1647
01:31:54,833 --> 01:31:56,083
Hey bus.

1648
01:32:07,416 --> 01:32:09,916
You have swallowed it.
- That was good.

1649
01:32:18,083 --> 01:32:20,625
Hey. Hey! What are you doing? Hey!

1650
01:32:20,833 --> 01:32:22,250
Hey, driver. Driver.

1651
01:32:22,541 --> 01:32:23,666
Stop the bus.

1652
01:32:29,166 --> 01:32:30,333
Come down, come down, come down.

1653
01:32:30,708 --> 01:32:31,791
Come down quickly.

1654
01:32:32,041 --> 01:32:35,541
Get down, get down, get down.

1655
01:32:35,875 --> 01:32:37,125
Yes.

1656
01:33:14,583 --> 01:33:18,125
Hello. Hey, no, no, wrong number.

01:33:26,458 --> 01:33:28,125
And you know my number already.

983024564.

1662
01:33:36,041 --> 01:33:38,875
Hello. No, wrong number.

1663
01:33:39,583 --> 01:33:41,791

I am in History
university in Kalyani University.

1666
01:33:50,375 --> 01:33:51,875
I had gone to my
uncle's house in Malda.

1667
01:33:51,958 --> 01:33:53,166
Now I am going back home.

1668
01:33:53,750 --> 01:33:55,708
Although you know my number..

1669
01:33:56,416 --> 01:33:57,541
..but yet I am saying it.

1670
01:33:58,458 --> 01:34:04,250
98304567.

1671
01:34:07,208 --> 01:34:10,458
Brother, my friend has
got down. You can sit here.

1672
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,291
Thanks. I will get my bag.
- Okay.

1673
01:34:16,875 --> 01:34:18,125
Hey!

1674
01:34:18,500 --> 01:34:19,833
Strange!

1675
01:34:22,291 --> 01:34:24,208
Wait, I will check if
everyone has got up.

1676
01:34:24,291 --> 01:34:25,375
What happened, brother?

1677
01:34:25,500 --> 01:34:27,375
I was feeling like puking.
That is why I came here and sat.

1678
01:34:27,500 --> 01:34:29,000
I see.
- You can sit on my seat. - Okay.

1679
01:34:32,833 --> 01:34:35,833
Hey, everything is fine. Come on,
come on, come on, come on.

1680
01:34:37,666 --> 01:34:39,583
"I love you, my lover."

1681
01:34:39,666 --> 01:34:41,125
"Ooh La, la."

1682
01:34:41,166 --> 01:34:43,083
"My lover."

1683
01:34:43,166 --> 01:34:44,500
"Ooh La, la."

1684
01:34:44,541 --> 01:34:46,458
"I love you, my lover."

1685
01:34:46,541 --> 01:34:50,208
"Ooh La, la."

1686
01:34:52,291 --> 01:34:53,500
What happened?
- Ooh La, la?

1687
01:34:53,583 --> 01:34:55,000
Are you looking at girls?
- No, no.

1688
01:34:56,291 --> 01:34:58,416
Hey, listen. These girls play sports.

1689
01:34:58,416 --> 01:35:00,666
So what should I do?
- Even you play.

1690
01:35:01,083 --> 01:35:02,875
Oh no, what are you doing?

1691
01:35:03,416 --> 01:35:05,458
I had told you so many
times to pick me from home.

1692
01:35:05,583 --> 01:35:06,750
Actually..

1693
01:35:07,750 --> 01:35:10,250
I had told you so many times.
Why didn't you pick me from home?

1694
01:35:10,333 --> 01:35:11,458
Now leave me.

1695
01:35:11,500 --> 01:35:13,000
Hey, listen, I am very
scared of your father.

1696
01:35:13,041 --> 01:35:14,458
He shows me the gun all the time.

1697
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:15,583
I see.

1698
01:35:15,833 --> 01:35:17,541
So if my father asks
you to leave me now..

1699
01:35:17,625 --> 01:35:18,708
..you will leave me.

1700
01:35:18,791 --> 01:35:21,458
Hey, no, no, he is a gentleman.
He will not say that at all.

1701
01:35:21,958 --> 01:35:23,875
Listen to me carefully.
Even if asks you..

1702
01:35:23,958 --> 01:35:25,333
..don't ever leave me.

1703
01:35:25,666 --> 01:35:27,583
Got it?
- Acting smart, are you?

1704
01:35:27,666 --> 01:35:30,583
Hey, are you in love?
Let me teach you a lesson.

1705
01:35:31,666 --> 01:35:33,208
Hit him. Hit him.

1706
01:35:33,291 --> 01:35:34,416
He loves Ria..

1707
01:35:34,500 --> 01:35:35,958
What did you tell him?
- What?

1708
01:35:36,333 --> 01:35:38,041
To him? What did you say?
- What?

1709
01:35:38,750 --> 01:35:41,458
I didn't get time to say anything.
He went on hitting me.

1710
01:35:41,708 --> 01:35:43,000
He had other men with him too.

1711
01:35:48,875 --> 01:35:50,125
Are you a doctor?

1712
01:35:51,541 --> 01:35:53,708
Hey, oh no, oh no. Oh Lord.
What are you doing?

1713
01:35:53,791 --> 01:35:55,625
Why? Would it be
better if I was a doctor?

1714
01:35:55,875 --> 01:35:58,000
No, no, a nurse will do fine for me.

1715
01:35:58,708 --> 01:36:01,416
No, I mean, I had a
dream since childhood.

1716
01:36:01,500 --> 01:36:03,791
I will have a love marriage
with a nurse when I grow up.

1717
01:36:10,500 --> 01:36:12,375
What did he say to you?
- What?

1718
01:36:12,833 --> 01:36:14,291
What did he say to you?

1719
01:36:15,916 --> 01:36:18,916
I didn't believe what he said.
- What?

1720
01:36:19,125 --> 01:36:21,375
He said that he is in love
with you for the last 6 years.

1721
01:36:22,625 --> 01:36:23,750
Water.

1722
01:36:27,375 --> 01:36:28,541
Open your mouth.

1723
01:36:33,416 --> 01:36:35,000
Whatever he said was right.

1724
01:36:36,625 --> 01:36:37,750
Hey, Ria.

1725
01:36:37,791 --> 01:36:40,166
Hey, Ria. Hey, Ria. Listen to me now.

1726
01:36:40,208 --> 01:36:41,833
What happened? Hey, Ria.

1727
01:36:42,083 --> 01:36:44,500
What happened? - He has been
after me for the last 6 years.

1728
01:36:44,583 --> 01:36:45,750
I didn't pay attention.

1729
01:36:45,875 --> 01:36:47,375
Then, one day, all of a sudden,
he called me..

1730
01:36:47,458 --> 01:36:48,916
..and said that I think of
myself as Madhuri Dixit.

1731
01:36:48,958 --> 01:36:50,958
And I wouldn't get a better
boy than him in this world.

1732
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:52,458
Yes. I am better than
him in all respects.

1733
01:36:52,833 --> 01:36:55,041
Meet me at Malda
Government hospital tomorrow.

1734
01:36:55,666 --> 01:36:56,791
Why?

1735
01:36:58,250 --> 01:36:59,958
Are you a government hospital nurse?

1736
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,541
No. - I am a nurse in
this private hospital.

1737
01:37:02,625 --> 01:37:03,875
Then why should we meet there?

1738
01:37:04,708 --> 01:37:05,875
That is because I asked you to.

1739
01:37:05,916 --> 01:37:07,000
Hey, hey..

1740
01:37:16,708 --> 01:37:17,875
Sorry.

1741
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,875
Have you got a passport
size photograph? - Yes.

1742
01:37:21,333 --> 01:37:22,458
Take.

1743
01:37:23,666 --> 01:37:24,791
You should have told me earlier that..

1744
01:37:24,875 --> 01:37:26,083
..we are getting a
registry marriage done.

1745
01:37:29,750 --> 01:37:31,166
Registry isn't happening.

1746
01:37:31,250 --> 01:37:32,416
Then?

1747
01:37:35,250 --> 01:37:36,583
What is your date of birth?

1748
01:37:37,375 --> 01:37:38,916
12th of May, 1986.

1749
01:37:48,541 --> 01:37:49,708
Sign it.

1750
01:37:50,833 --> 01:37:52,041
What form is this?

1751
01:37:53,125 --> 01:37:54,833
Organ donation.
- Meaning?

1752
01:37:55,625 --> 01:37:56,750
After you die..

1753
01:37:56,833 --> 01:37:58,083
..all the organs of
yours that will get wasted..

1754
01:37:58,208 --> 01:37:59,416
..will be donated by you.

1755
01:38:00,708 --> 01:38:01,916
I want to make a call at home.

1756
01:38:04,791 --> 01:38:06,291
What is the need to be
scared about everything?

1757
01:38:06,833 --> 01:38:08,750
Even I made the donation.
Did I ask anyone?

1758
01:38:08,833 --> 01:38:11,208
Sign it quietly. Sign it.

1759
01:38:12,125 --> 01:38:13,541
Sign it.

1760
01:38:14,875 --> 01:38:16,875
Actually this is the first time.

1761
01:38:19,125 --> 01:38:20,750
Everything happens for
the first time in life.

1762
01:38:20,791 --> 01:38:22,375
You are having an
affair for the first time.

1763
01:38:22,458 --> 01:38:23,666
Yes, but..

1764
01:38:26,583 --> 01:38:27,791
Sign it.

1765
01:38:37,291 --> 01:38:38,791
They will take it after I die, right?

1766
01:38:45,791 --> 01:38:47,083
Thank you.
- Thank you.

1767
01:38:49,666 --> 01:38:51,041
What is your age?

1768
01:38:51,458 --> 01:38:52,583
26.

1769
01:38:53,291 --> 01:38:55,250
What do you think? How
old do you think I am?

1770
01:38:55,833 --> 01:38:57,291
How old can you be?

1771
01:38:58,291 --> 01:38:59,916
I am just four..

1772
01:39:00,166 --> 01:39:01,375
Four years younger?

1773
01:39:01,458 --> 01:39:04,458
That means, you are 22.

1774
01:39:06,416 --> 01:39:07,750
I am four months older than you.

1775
01:39:17,333 --> 01:39:18,500
Hey, Ria.

1776
01:39:18,583 --> 01:39:20,833
Hey, Ria. - Listen to me. I am
saying that it doesn't matter.

1777
01:39:20,916 --> 01:39:22,166
I will manage it.

1778
01:39:22,833 --> 01:39:23,958
Listen..

1779
01:39:33,583 --> 01:39:35,250
How is Raghav in this situation?

1780
01:39:35,333 --> 01:39:36,708
Oh Lord, how would I know?

1781
01:39:36,750 --> 01:39:37,916
You don't know?

1782
01:39:37,958 --> 01:39:39,250
I am telling the truth. I don't know.

1783
01:39:39,750 --> 01:39:41,875
Why? Are you feeling bad?

1784
01:39:41,958 --> 01:39:43,916
Feeling bad?
- Yes? - I will give you one slap.

1785
01:39:44,333 --> 01:39:45,416
Firstly, there is a caste problem..

1786
01:39:45,500 --> 01:39:46,958
..and then you are four
months younger. Get in.

1787
01:39:55,333 --> 01:39:56,625
Stop, stop, stop.

1788
01:39:58,583 --> 01:39:59,958
I am leaving. Meet you later..

1789
01:40:00,250 --> 01:40:03,916
Hey! Stop, stop, stop.

1790
01:40:05,291 --> 01:40:06,708
Ria! Hey, Ria.

1791
01:40:06,791 --> 01:40:08,458
Listen, I thought a lot. Okay?

1792
01:40:08,500 --> 01:40:10,291
It doesn't matter if you
are four months older.

1793
01:40:10,666 --> 01:40:12,916
Because now look, Sachin
Tendulkar's wife, Anjali..

1794
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:14,500
..is five years older than him.

1795
01:40:14,583 --> 01:40:17,666
And Saif Ali Khan's wife, Amrita
Singh, was much older than him.

1796
01:40:17,708 --> 01:40:19,916
And it really doesn't matter
if we are Hindu and Muslims.

1797
01:40:19,958 --> 01:40:22,041
Because look at Saif Ali Khan.
He married Kareena Kapoor.

1798
01:40:22,125 --> 01:40:23,208
Yes.

1799
01:40:24,125 --> 01:40:25,291
Listen to something.

1800
01:40:27,583 --> 01:40:30,333
You are not Saif Ali
Khan or Sachin Tendulkar.

1801
01:40:30,750 --> 01:40:33,208
And neither am I
Amrita Singh or Anjali.

1802
01:40:33,750 --> 01:40:36,375
Now, I know that neither am I
Sachin nor Saif Ali Khan. None of them.

1803
01:40:36,666 --> 01:40:38,125
But for me, you are Anjali..

1804
01:40:38,208 --> 01:40:40,333
..Amrita Singh and
even Kareena Kapoor.

1805
01:40:40,458 --> 01:40:41,583
Shut up.

1806
01:40:42,875 --> 01:40:44,000
Deepa.

1807
01:40:46,125 --> 01:40:47,333
Sit here.

1808
01:41:00,166 --> 01:41:01,250
What are you doing?

1809
01:41:01,708 --> 01:41:03,125
I haven't come here
to get treatment done.

1810
01:41:03,166 --> 01:41:04,458
Hey, Ria.

1811
01:41:06,958 --> 01:41:08,833
Injection? Yes?

1812
01:41:11,166 --> 01:41:12,333
Yes.

1813
01:41:17,166 --> 01:41:19,208
Hey, slowly. Oh no.

1814
01:41:24,541 --> 01:41:26,708
Hey, Dipa. Listen. Is he done?

1815
01:41:27,041 --> 01:41:28,208
Take it to the lab.

1816
01:41:29,083 --> 01:41:31,125
Even she wears a uniform
while working like me.

1817
01:41:32,041 --> 01:41:33,500
But she is so beautiful.

1818
01:41:34,166 --> 01:41:36,375
Yes. But why did she take my blood?

1819
01:41:36,458 --> 01:41:37,625
There is a need.

1820
01:41:38,166 --> 01:41:40,458
It is Monday today, right?
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday..

1821
01:41:40,583 --> 01:41:42,583
We will meet on Thursday evening at 5.

1822
01:41:42,666 --> 01:41:44,166
What? So many days?

1823
01:41:44,500 --> 01:41:45,833
Cannot we meet tomorrow?

1824
01:41:46,708 --> 01:41:49,125
Thursday evening at 5. Go.

1825
01:41:50,375 --> 01:41:52,208
Go.
- Yes.

1826
01:42:04,666 --> 01:42:05,791
Here you are.

1827
01:42:12,833 --> 01:42:14,083
What is this?

1828
01:42:14,958 --> 01:42:16,250
This is an HIV test report.

1829
01:42:16,333 --> 01:42:17,458
What is that?

1830
01:42:17,541 --> 01:42:19,375
I got you tested for AIDS.

1831
01:42:19,458 --> 01:42:22,916
What? You thought I have AIDS?
You doubted me, Ria?

1832
01:42:24,291 --> 01:42:25,416
Why cannot I have a doubt?

1833
01:42:26,416 --> 01:42:28,791
Are you my school mate?
Or a childhood friend?

1834
01:42:29,333 --> 01:42:30,708
A neighbor or an acquaintance?

1835
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:32,125
You are not, right?

1836
01:42:32,208 --> 01:42:33,875
Then how I can trust you?

1837
01:42:38,791 --> 01:42:40,125
You say that you love me.

1838
01:42:40,958 --> 01:42:43,041
That means, after this
when we are in love..

1839
01:42:43,250 --> 01:42:44,375
What do you mean by after this..

1840
01:42:44,458 --> 01:42:45,583
Aren't you in love with me now?

1841
01:42:46,208 --> 01:42:47,333
No.

1842
01:42:47,416 --> 01:42:48,541
When we are in love..

1843
01:42:49,125 --> 01:42:51,208
..I am sure you would want to
take me to a cinema hall and..

1844
01:42:51,291 --> 01:42:52,958
..hold my hand
sitting on a corner seat.

1845
01:42:53,041 --> 01:42:54,125
Hey, no, no, I swear on Lord.

1846
01:42:54,208 --> 01:42:55,333
I wouldn't do that.

1847
01:42:56,125 --> 01:42:57,625
And then when we walk
on the roads together..

1848
01:42:57,750 --> 01:42:59,000
..you will touch your
fingers to mine first.

1849
01:42:59,041 --> 01:43:00,208
And then, you will
keep your hands on mine.

1850
01:43:00,291 --> 01:43:01,958
No, no, I don't think
about all those things, Ria.

1851
01:43:02,208 --> 01:43:03,625
And then, when we sit
together in the bus..

1852
01:43:03,708 --> 01:43:04,875
..on the pretext of sleeping..

1853
01:43:04,958 --> 01:43:06,250
..you will keep your
shoulder on my head.

1854
01:43:06,583 --> 01:43:08,958
I don't feel sleepy when I
get up on the bus. - I see.

1855
01:43:09,375 --> 01:43:11,500
And then, you stay
alone in your house. - Yes.

1856
01:43:11,958 --> 01:43:13,250
If I go to your house alone one day..

1857
01:43:14,083 --> 01:43:15,791
..you will try to do
something wrong with me. - Hey!

1858
01:43:15,875 --> 01:43:17,291
What rubbish are you saying?
Disgusting.

1859
01:43:17,375 --> 01:43:19,416
I don't think about all
those things. I don't..

1860
01:43:19,750 --> 01:43:21,291
You won't do anything?
- No, no.

1861
01:43:21,833 --> 01:43:23,541
Then what is the point
of having an affair? What?

1862
01:43:25,166 --> 01:43:26,833
Ria. Hey, Ria.

1863
01:43:27,250 --> 01:43:29,708
Are you looking for a point in love?
- Yes, sure.

1864
01:43:30,041 --> 01:43:31,333
Love doesn't just mean that..

1865
01:43:31,375 --> 01:43:32,583
..both of us will keep
looking at each other, Noor.

1866
01:43:32,625 --> 01:43:35,000
There are good times
and bad times in love.

1867
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:36,083
There is profit and loss as well.

1868
01:43:36,166 --> 01:43:37,250
And when you are in love with me..

1869
01:43:37,333 --> 01:43:38,416
..you will have to
face these problems.

1870
01:43:38,500 --> 01:43:41,375
And that is why I sent you
to meet father and Raghav.

1871
01:43:42,125 --> 01:43:43,333
And on the other side..

1872
01:43:43,416 --> 01:43:44,833
..I am sure your mother
doesn't know our age difference.

1873
01:43:45,083 --> 01:43:47,416
When she comes to know I am
sure she will ask questions.

1874
01:43:47,916 --> 01:43:50,166
Your father will scare you
about my father being a cop.

1875
01:43:51,458 --> 01:43:52,791
And apart from that, you
are Muslim and I am Hindu.

1876
01:43:52,875 --> 01:43:53,958
That problem is already there.

1877
01:43:54,166 --> 01:43:55,333
Now think over it.

1878
01:43:55,458 --> 01:43:56,583
If you can handle all these problems..

1879
01:43:56,666 --> 01:43:59,750
..then carry on an affair
with me. And if you cannot..

1880
01:44:00,750 --> 01:44:01,916
..I am leaving, boss.

1881
01:44:02,958 --> 01:44:05,291
Ria. Ria.

1882
01:44:05,375 --> 01:44:06,500
Ria, I love you.

1883
01:44:06,583 --> 01:44:08,541
I will accept you the way you are.

1884
01:44:08,625 --> 01:44:11,041
Ria, I will just live with you.

1885
01:44:13,125 --> 01:44:15,333
Not like this. Take an hour's time.

1886
01:44:15,750 --> 01:44:16,833
Think over it and then let me know.

1887
01:44:16,958 --> 01:44:18,000
What is the point of
thinking about this?

1888
01:44:18,625 --> 01:44:19,750
Think. Think.

1889
01:44:21,541 --> 01:44:23,666
Ria. Hey, Ria.

1890
01:44:56,875 --> 01:45:00,250
Ria, actually I thought for an hour.

1891
01:45:00,458 --> 01:45:01,583
I thought very carefully.

1892
01:45:01,666 --> 01:45:04,041
If my mother has a problem
with our age difference..

1893
01:45:04,291 --> 01:45:05,625
..or if my father tries
to scare me by saying..

1894
01:45:05,708 --> 01:45:06,875
..that your father is a cop..

1895
01:45:07,041 --> 01:45:08,500
..then I wouldn't listen to them.

1896
01:45:11,500 --> 01:45:13,041
I will just live with you.

1897
01:45:13,125 --> 01:45:14,291
Will you change your opinion later?

1898
01:45:14,375 --> 01:45:15,916
No, no, not at all. I swear on Lord.

1899
01:45:18,958 --> 01:45:20,125
I love you too. Come on.

1900
01:45:21,125 --> 01:45:22,833
Hey.. Hey, Ria.

1901
01:45:22,916 --> 01:45:24,375
Ria.
- What is it?

1902
01:45:24,458 --> 01:45:27,708
I am saying that I was
expecting something bigger than this.

1903
01:45:28,166 --> 01:45:29,583
What do you mean by that?

1904
01:45:36,583 --> 01:45:37,916
Hug me.
- What?

1905
01:45:38,291 --> 01:45:40,875
Hug me.
- No, no, disgusting.

1906
01:45:41,166 --> 01:45:42,583
I mean, I am not saying that.

1907
01:45:42,666 --> 01:45:45,833
I was saying that we can
spend a good time, right?

1908
01:45:45,916 --> 01:45:47,083
Yes?

1909
01:45:47,291 --> 01:45:48,416
There is no time.

1910
01:45:49,958 --> 01:45:51,458
I am a nurse.

1911
01:45:51,833 --> 01:45:53,375
A nurse cannot leave the
hospital anytime she feels like..

1912
01:45:53,458 --> 01:45:55,166
..and spend her time.

1913
01:45:55,458 --> 01:45:56,625
Take a leave.

1914
01:45:58,083 --> 01:45:59,250
And what should I give
as an excuse for a leave?

1915
01:45:59,541 --> 01:46:02,208
Why? You had said that
when a person is in love..

1916
01:46:02,291 --> 01:46:03,916
..he has to bunk
office and take leaves.

1917
01:46:04,208 --> 01:46:05,375
Even you take a leave.

1918
01:46:08,708 --> 01:46:09,791
Hey!

1919
01:46:34,708 --> 01:46:41,250
"It is difficult living
without you even for a day."

1920
01:46:41,375 --> 01:46:45,375
"I want to spend a night.
Stretch forth your hands."

1921
01:46:45,791 --> 01:46:50,416
"Break all the obstacles."

1922
01:46:50,500 --> 01:46:57,083
"Speak. Become alight like a poem."

1923
01:46:57,125 --> 01:46:59,375
"Like the colors of the garden."

1924
01:46:59,458 --> 01:47:01,500
"Like the assorted colors."

1925
01:47:01,583 --> 01:47:03,666
"And the way the colors spread."

1926
01:47:03,750 --> 01:47:05,791
"Without an address."

1927
01:47:06,125 --> 01:47:10,541
"Hey, whenever I have wanted you."

1928
01:47:10,625 --> 01:47:14,375
"We have been separated."

1929
01:47:14,458 --> 01:47:17,833
"I have said it so many times."

1930
01:47:17,875 --> 01:47:22,291
"I have got someone who
doesn't understand my pain."

1931
01:47:22,583 --> 01:47:29,416
"It is difficult living
without you even for a day."

1932
01:47:46,541 --> 01:47:49,416
"One day, all of sudden."

1933
01:47:50,166 --> 01:47:54,291
"I had seen you."

1934
01:47:54,375 --> 01:47:57,750
"In the lonely veranda."

1935
01:47:57,833 --> 01:48:01,958
"I had drawn so many
images without a reason."

1936
01:48:02,041 --> 01:48:05,416
"One day, all of sudden."

1937
01:48:06,125 --> 01:48:10,250
"I had seen you."

1938
01:48:10,291 --> 01:48:13,625
"In the lonely veranda."

1939
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:17,958
"I had drawn so many
images without a reason."

1940
01:48:18,041 --> 01:48:22,375
"I have fallen in love
with an innocent mind."

1941
01:48:22,458 --> 01:48:26,416
"I have looked for you all the time."

1942
01:48:26,500 --> 01:48:34,041
"I have burnt inside
listening to your voice inside me."

1943
01:48:34,416 --> 01:48:41,625
"It is difficult living
without you even for a day."

1944
01:49:14,333 --> 01:49:17,000
"Now it has started."

1945
01:49:18,375 --> 01:49:22,375
"Our meetings have started."

1946
01:49:22,458 --> 01:49:25,083
"The bright light of the love."

1947
01:49:26,208 --> 01:49:30,083
"And the restlessness of the mind."

1948
01:49:30,166 --> 01:49:32,833
"Now it has started."

1949
01:49:34,250 --> 01:49:38,250
"Our meetings have started."

1950
01:49:38,333 --> 01:49:41,041
"The bright light of the love."

1951
01:49:42,166 --> 01:49:45,958
"And the restlessness of the mind."

1952
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:50,125
"All the times that
I have wanted you."

1953
01:49:50,208 --> 01:49:54,166
"We have been separated."

1954
01:49:54,250 --> 01:49:57,458
"All the times that I have said it."

1955
01:49:57,541 --> 01:50:01,500
"I have got someone who
doesn't understand my pain."

1956
01:50:02,125 --> 01:50:08,750
"It is difficult living
without you even for a day."

1957
01:50:32,166 --> 01:50:34,875
I have told everyone at home
about our relationship. - Yes.

1958
01:50:35,083 --> 01:50:36,416
You have told your family?

1959
01:50:36,833 --> 01:50:38,000
I will tell them.

1960
01:50:39,500 --> 01:50:40,625
What do you mean?

1961
01:50:41,500 --> 01:50:42,708
You haven't told them yet?

1962
01:50:42,958 --> 01:50:44,416
No, I will tell them tonight.

1963
01:50:45,166 --> 01:50:48,500
Call right now.
- I don't have balance in my phone.

1964
01:50:52,333 --> 01:50:53,583
Call from my phone. -What?

1965
01:50:53,791 --> 01:50:54,875
Tell me the number.

1966
01:50:55,333 --> 01:50:57,125
Ria, look..

1967
01:50:57,208 --> 01:50:58,333
I mean, listen..

1968
01:50:58,416 --> 01:51:00,083
I mean, whatever we have between us..

1969
01:51:00,166 --> 01:51:01,708
..is not a problem. Okay?

1970
01:51:01,791 --> 01:51:03,791
But if our problem reaches our homes..

1971
01:51:03,875 --> 01:51:05,208
..it will be a bigger problem.

1972
01:51:05,291 --> 01:51:06,958
And when that
problem comes back to us..

1973
01:51:07,041 --> 01:51:08,875
..it will be a bigger problem. Right?

1974
01:51:09,041 --> 01:51:10,291
What do you think?

1975
01:51:10,375 --> 01:51:11,708
And if you don't make that call..

1976
01:51:11,833 --> 01:51:12,916
..there will be a problem here.

1977
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:14,166
Tell me the number.

1978
01:51:15,291 --> 01:51:17,916
97320184.

1979
01:51:20,833 --> 01:51:22,000
84?
- Yes.

1980
01:51:29,166 --> 01:51:30,666
Hello.
- Hello.

1981
01:51:31,416 --> 01:51:33,875
Can I speak to Noor's mother?
- Hey, no, no..

1982
01:51:34,500 --> 01:51:35,750
Hey, it is a call for you.

1983
01:51:36,083 --> 01:51:37,958
Who is it?
- God knows. I don't know.

1984
01:51:41,541 --> 01:51:43,375
Hello.
- Yes, aunt.

1985
01:51:43,458 --> 01:51:46,000
No, no.
- This is Noor's friend.

1986
01:51:47,208 --> 01:51:49,791
Actually Noor and I
have a relationship.

1987
01:51:49,875 --> 01:51:51,708
And Noor.. Noor is afraid
of talking to you about it.

1988
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:53,583
That is why I told you.

1989
01:51:54,208 --> 01:51:55,375
Yes.

1990
01:51:55,916 --> 01:51:57,375
Yes. Noor will talk to you.

1991
01:51:57,458 --> 01:51:58,583
Here you are.

1992
01:51:59,500 --> 01:52:01,500
Why are you sitting with
your tongue out? Talk to her.

1993
01:52:02,125 --> 01:52:03,250
Yes..

1994
01:52:03,791 --> 01:52:06,958
Yes. Hello. Mother?

1995
01:52:07,208 --> 01:52:08,541
What is the girl's name?

1996
01:52:08,625 --> 01:52:10,166
What? What?

1997
01:52:10,958 --> 01:52:12,083
What is her name?

1998
01:52:13,083 --> 01:52:15,333
Can I say everything
when I go home? Yes? Yes.

1999
01:52:16,041 --> 01:52:17,333
Yes, yes, you will like her a lot.

2000
01:52:17,416 --> 01:52:18,500
I.. I will get her with me.

2001
01:52:18,583 --> 01:52:21,125
Okay, come here quickly with her.

2002
01:52:21,208 --> 01:52:22,333
Okay, hang up now.

2003
01:52:24,416 --> 01:52:25,583
Yes.

2004
01:52:25,666 --> 01:52:27,875
I have told her. Mother has
asked me to take you with me.

2005
01:52:29,791 --> 01:52:31,166
There is no need to go at the moment.

2006
01:52:31,750 --> 01:52:33,208
We can go at the time of the wedding.

2007
01:52:34,041 --> 01:52:37,041
No, I mean, I would have taken
you there for some other reason.

2008
01:52:39,291 --> 01:52:40,416
What is the reason?

2009
01:52:41,500 --> 01:52:42,708
Just..

2010
01:52:42,833 --> 01:52:45,125
Now if I take you with me
after the marriage to the village..

2011
01:52:45,375 --> 01:52:47,416
..my friends will say.

2012
01:52:47,708 --> 01:52:50,000
Wow. Noor has such a beautiful wife.

2013
01:52:50,833 --> 01:52:51,916
But.

2014
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:55,208
If I take you with me now..
- Okay?

2015
01:52:55,291 --> 01:52:56,791
Then my friends will say that..

2016
01:52:56,833 --> 01:52:58,208
..Noor has found a
great looking girl..

2017
01:52:58,750 --> 01:53:00,541
No, I mean he has found a girlfriend.

2018
01:53:01,375 --> 01:53:04,375
I see. So that is the reason
you want to take me there?

2019
01:53:04,875 --> 01:53:06,500
Good. Very good.

2020
01:53:06,583 --> 01:53:07,833
I won't go anywhere with you.

2021
01:53:07,916 --> 01:53:09,666
Hey, Ria. Ria, I
didn't want to say that.

2022
01:53:09,750 --> 01:53:11,500
Hey, Ria, listen to me.
I didn't say that.

2023
01:53:11,583 --> 01:53:12,791
Hey, Ria. Ria.

2024
01:53:12,875 --> 01:53:14,333
Ria. Hey, don't go.

2025
01:53:14,625 --> 01:53:15,708
Hey, Ria.

2026
01:53:15,750 --> 01:53:17,125
Hey, there are other reasons as well.

2027
01:53:17,208 --> 01:53:18,375
Hey, I have to tell mother.

2028
01:53:18,750 --> 01:53:21,916
Hey, Ria. Ria. Ria.

2029
01:53:24,333 --> 01:53:26,333
Hey, Ria. Hey, what happened?
Why are you getting angry?

2030
01:53:26,416 --> 01:53:28,416
Because you cannot angry with
me anytime. That is the reason.

2031
01:53:28,500 --> 01:53:30,250
Why don't you get
angry with me? Tell me.

2032
01:53:30,500 --> 01:53:33,250
What is that? Can I ever
get angry with my darling?

2033
01:53:33,333 --> 01:53:34,791
What if I make a mistake some time?

2034
01:53:35,041 --> 01:53:36,333
I wouldn't be angry
even then. -Why not?

2035
01:53:36,791 --> 01:53:37,916
Why? Why wouldn't you be
angry if I made a mistake?

2036
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:39,750
Get angry with me if I
make a mistake. Got it?

2037
01:53:39,833 --> 01:53:41,333
Or else, few years after marriage,
when we fight..

2038
01:53:41,416 --> 01:53:43,083
..you will say things to me..

2039
01:53:43,291 --> 01:53:44,583
..like you have never
stopped me from doing anything..

2040
01:53:44,666 --> 01:53:45,791
..or created obstacles or
didn't get angry with me.

2041
01:53:45,875 --> 01:53:48,666
I wouldn't listen to all that. If
I make a mistake, get angry. Yes.

2042
01:53:48,916 --> 01:53:51,166
And if I don't make a
mistake and yet you shout at me..

2043
01:53:51,250 --> 01:53:52,583
..I will give you two tight slaps.
- Hey!

2044
01:53:53,208 --> 01:53:55,083
Hey. Practice being angry with me.

2045
01:53:55,875 --> 01:53:57,583
Right now?
- Yes, right now. Get angry.

2046
01:54:18,833 --> 01:54:21,083
I cannot get angry.
- Try it. You can get angry.

2047
01:54:21,166 --> 01:54:22,333
Yes.

2048
01:54:43,333 --> 01:54:44,500
I cannot do it.

2049
01:54:47,666 --> 01:54:48,833
Useless.

2050
01:54:50,041 --> 01:54:51,125
Hey, Ria.

2051
01:54:52,125 --> 01:54:54,416
I tried being angry.
I will practice more.

2052
01:54:54,500 --> 01:54:55,666
What can I do if I cannot do it?
- Hey!

2053
01:54:55,708 --> 01:54:58,041
Hey, watch it.
- Hey! You are strange!

2054
01:54:58,958 --> 01:55:00,875
You made the girl fall down?
- No, I mean.. - Keep quiet.

2055
01:55:01,375 --> 01:55:02,458
You have a lot of anger, right?

2056
01:55:02,541 --> 01:55:03,625
I will give you one tight slap.

2057
01:55:05,375 --> 01:55:07,708
Give me your hand. - Hey! Hey,
why are you giving your hand?

2058
01:55:08,458 --> 01:55:09,625
I will pick her up.

2059
01:55:10,666 --> 01:55:12,291
Move.
- I see.

2060
01:55:15,041 --> 01:55:16,208
Continue.

2061
01:55:18,041 --> 01:55:19,375
Even if you don't say it,
I will continue.

2062
01:55:22,875 --> 01:55:23,958
Hey, Ria.

2063
01:55:24,250 --> 01:55:26,375
Listen, I didn't understand.
Very sorry.

2064
01:55:26,458 --> 01:55:28,041
I didn't understand that
I will push you so hard.

2065
01:55:28,125 --> 01:55:30,041
Listen to me. Oh no, listen to me.

2066
01:55:30,708 --> 01:55:32,375
I was asking you to get
angry like this. -What?

2067
01:55:32,625 --> 01:55:34,750
Tomorrow, meet my
parents and take me from home.

2068
01:55:35,166 --> 01:55:37,250
What? Hey, why meet at home?
Come to the bus stand.

2069
01:55:37,333 --> 01:55:38,666
Home.
- No, bus stand.

2070
01:55:39,875 --> 01:55:41,583
Home.
- 'Bus stand.'

2071
01:55:42,500 --> 01:55:43,958
'What happened? Hey!'

2072
01:55:44,416 --> 01:55:45,875
Hey, we are reaching Paltanda.

2073
01:55:46,125 --> 01:55:47,625
Everyone who needs to
get down can get down.

2074
01:55:48,333 --> 01:55:49,791
Ria. Come on.

2075
01:55:52,541 --> 01:55:56,541
Noor. Get down with me at Behrampore.

2076
01:55:56,833 --> 01:55:58,958
My son is waiting there with the car.

2077
01:55:59,125 --> 01:56:01,541
After this, both of us will
reach the village together.

2078
01:56:01,791 --> 01:56:02,916
Okay? -Yes.

2079
01:56:08,625 --> 01:56:09,791
Ria?
- Yes.

2080
01:56:09,875 --> 01:56:11,000
This is our village.

2081
01:56:11,541 --> 01:56:12,625
This one?
- Yes.

2082
01:56:12,708 --> 01:56:14,500
Now this road that you can see.
- Yes.

2083
01:56:14,583 --> 01:56:15,666
Now when you go straight from here..

2084
01:56:15,750 --> 01:56:16,916
..there is a mosque on the right side.

2085
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:18,333
Our house is right
next to that mosque.

2086
01:56:21,875 --> 01:56:24,333
Wait, wait, hey, wait, wait.
Stop, stop, stop.

2087
01:56:27,166 --> 01:56:28,833
Eat well.

2088
01:56:29,208 --> 01:56:31,250
Yes, I will. Even you do it.

2089
01:56:31,333 --> 01:56:33,333
Yes.
- And call me.

2090
01:56:33,958 --> 01:56:36,083
Yes, I will call. Bye.

2091
01:56:38,083 --> 01:56:39,166
Bye.

2092
01:56:47,250 --> 01:56:49,666
Hey, even I will go. Even I will go.

2093
01:56:49,750 --> 01:56:51,875
Hey, stop, stop, stop, stop.

2094
01:56:53,041 --> 01:56:54,166
Even I will go. Get up.

2095
01:56:54,500 --> 01:56:56,166
Strange passenger. Go in.

2096
01:57:01,791 --> 01:57:03,458
What is it with you?

2097
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:06,708
I don't feel like letting you go.

2098
01:57:07,708 --> 01:57:09,666
I will get down at the
next stop. I give you my word.

2099
01:57:10,416 --> 01:57:12,791
Why aren't you speaking? Get up.

2100
01:57:14,625 --> 01:57:17,125
Where are you taking him?

2101
01:57:25,250 --> 01:57:28,791
Who wants to buy dolls?
Dolls from Krishna nagar?

2102
01:57:29,041 --> 01:57:31,916
Want dolls? Want to take dolls?

2103
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:33,166
Want to take dolls?

2104
01:57:33,250 --> 01:57:35,000
Take this kid Krishna's idol.

2105
01:57:35,083 --> 01:57:37,166
You will see that you will get
a kid who looks like Krishna.

2106
01:57:37,250 --> 01:57:38,458
Take it.

2107
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:43,666
How much?
- What is the price?

2108
01:57:43,750 --> 01:57:45,791
10 rupees.
- Here you are. Take it.

2109
01:57:48,666 --> 01:57:51,750
Sister. Sister. Take this idol.

2110
01:57:51,833 --> 01:57:54,791
You won't get idols made of the
earth of Krishna Nagar anywhere else.

2111
01:57:54,916 --> 01:57:56,625
Take this idol of Radha and Krishna.

2112
01:57:56,708 --> 01:57:59,291
Your love will be as successful
as the love of Radha and Krishna.

2113
01:57:59,375 --> 01:58:00,541
Take it, sister.

2114
01:58:04,041 --> 01:58:05,833
How much?
- Rupees 10, sister.

2115
01:58:10,708 --> 01:58:11,958
Watch it, watch it. Watch it.

2116
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,958
Hey, brother. Sit straight.
Sit properly. Sit. Sit.

2117
01:58:15,041 --> 01:58:16,750
Brother, please tell me
when we reach Behrampore.

2118
01:58:16,875 --> 01:58:18,291
What? Behrampore?

2119
01:58:18,375 --> 01:58:19,541
We have crossed that.
- What?

2120
01:58:19,583 --> 01:58:20,958
Why didn't you get down?
- It crossed?

2121
01:58:21,458 --> 01:58:23,250
Hey, mister.
- Yes. You should have told me.

01:58:24,208 --> 01:58:26,250
Brother, stop the bus.
I want to get down.

2123
01:58:26,291 --> 01:58:28,458
Hey, you won't get anything here.

2124
01:58:28,583 --> 01:58:30,250
Get down at Palshanta now.

2125
01:58:30,291 --> 01:58:31,583
Take the bus from there
and go back to Behrampore.

2126
01:58:31,666 --> 01:58:32,791
Yes.

Sit down. Sit down. I
will tell you when we reach.

2128
01:58:49,500 --> 01:58:51,291
What is this?

2129
01:58:54,625 --> 01:58:56,041
Oh Lord.

2130
01:58:56,125 --> 01:58:57,291
Hey, drive carefully..

2131
02:01:12,583 --> 02:01:13,750
Are you fine?

2132
02:01:15,500 --> 02:01:19,500
Yes? Are you..
- I am fine. Don't say anything.

2133
02:01:36,291 --> 02:01:37,416

Hold him..
- Yes. Give him to me.

02:02:17,541 --> 02:02:18,666
Hey!

2139
02:02:20,625 --> 02:02:21,750
Come on, let me see you.

2140
02:02:26,666 --> 02:02:28,583
Brother, please pick her up. Brother.

2141
02:02:32,541 --> 02:02:34,333
Get up on the vehicle.

2142
02:02:34,666 --> 02:02:35,708
Get up on the vehicle.

Let me see. Someone..

2153
02:03:08,750 --> 02:03:10,208
Someone, come here, please.

2154
02:03:19,666 --> 02:03:25,166
"I feel like staying here. And
be immersed in her fragrance."

2155
02:03:25,250 --> 02:03:29,291
"That came down in the
evening in the neighborhood."

2156
02:03:30,500 --> 02:03:31,750
"The need to keep the
fragrance tied down."

2157
02:03:31,791 --> 02:03:34,208
Stretcher.
Stretcher. Take her. Take her.

"I am lost and looking
at the window at the end."

2160
02:03:41,375 --> 02:03:44,250
Hey, one minute, one minute.

02:03:44,708 --> 02:03:45,875
"She doesn't understand."

2162
02:03:46,583 --> 02:03:47,833
Hey, open your eyes
once and look. Do you..

2163
02:03:47,916 --> 02:03:49,750
Do you recognize me? I had
gone to Balughat to look for you.

2164
02:03:49,833 --> 02:03:50,916
I went to your sister's
house in Kolkata to look for..

2165
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:52,125
..the address but I didn't find it.

"She doesn't understand."

2183
02:04:54,333 --> 02:04:57,166
"She doesn't understand."

2184
02:04:57,250 --> 02:04:59,291
"She doesn't understand."

02:06:03,666 --> 02:06:04,791
Keep it inside.

02:06:14,708 --> 02:06:18,958
Hey, all our relatives are
waiting here to see you.

2198
02:06:26,125 --> 02:06:28,541
Actually the bus that

02:07:55,500 --> 02:07:57,375
She was coming back
from her uncle's house.

2215
02:08:18,916 --> 02:08:20,291
Hey, your first aid
hasn't happened yet? - Yes?

2216
02:08:20,375 --> 02:08:21,541
Come on, come on, come on.

2217
02:08:27,250 --> 02:08:29,333
Hey, hey, hey. One minute.
One minute. One minute.

2218
02:08:56,625 --> 02:08:57,666
Hey, Noor.

2219
02:08:58,166 --> 02:08:59,333
Hey, Noor.

2220
02:08:59,416 --> 02:09:00,583
Hey, Noor. Open your eyes.

2221
02:09:00,833 --> 02:09:02,166
Hey, Noor. Please get up.

2222
02:09:02,250 --> 02:09:04,083
Hey, Noor. Open your eyes once.

2223
02:09:04,166 --> 02:09:05,875
Whatever you do, I will..

2224
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,666
Hey, Noor, I will
never get angry with you.

2225
02:09:09,125 --> 02:09:10,958
I will do whatever you ask me to do.

2226
02:09:11,041 --> 02:09:13,375
Please open your eyes once.

2227
02:09:13,791 --> 02:09:15,583
Open your eyes once.

2228
02:09:16,208 --> 02:09:19,000
Open your eyes once please.

2229
02:09:19,083 --> 02:09:20,833
Open your eyes once.

2230
02:09:21,791 --> 02:09:23,708
Open your eyes once.

2231
02:09:24,458 --> 02:09:25,666
Noor.

2232
02:09:28,541 --> 02:09:30,625
"The need to keep it tied down."

2233
02:09:30,708 --> 02:09:32,875
"Is increasing my thirst."

2234
02:09:32,958 --> 02:09:37,875
"I am standing at the
window and looking at the end."

2235
02:09:38,291 --> 02:09:40,916
"She doesn't understand."

2236
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:43,333
"She doesn't understand."

2237
02:09:43,625 --> 02:09:46,416
"She doesn't understand."

2238
02:09:46,500 --> 02:09:48,291
"She doesn't understand."

2239
02:09:48,875 --> 02:09:52,000
"She doesn't understand."

2240
02:09:52,083 --> 02:09:54,250
"She doesn't understand."

2241
02:09:54,333 --> 02:09:57,166
"She doesn't understand."

2242
02:09:57,208 --> 02:09:59,541
"She doesn't understand."

2243
02:09:59,833 --> 02:10:02,208
"She doesn't understand."

2244
02:10:02,291 --> 02:10:04,791
"She doesn't understand."

2245
02:10:05,416 --> 02:10:06,500
What do you want?

2246
02:10:06,625 --> 02:10:08,125
Sister, can I go in for a minute?

2247
02:10:08,208 --> 02:10:09,666
Their condition is very serious.

2248
02:10:09,708 --> 02:10:11,791
Doctor isn't allowing anyone.
Please.. - I just want..

2249
02:10:12,291 --> 02:10:13,791
Sister. - "There are
empty dreams at the feet."

2250
02:10:13,875 --> 02:10:14,958
Sister, please, just once..

2251
02:10:15,791 --> 02:10:17,458
"And hence, I will keep it preserved."

2252
02:10:17,541 --> 02:10:21,875
"I will see who decorates
them with renewed care."

2253
02:10:23,166 --> 02:10:25,375
Oh! It happened because of me.

2254
02:10:25,875 --> 02:10:28,208
If I would have allowed you
to get down at the last stop..

2255
02:10:28,291 --> 02:10:30,583
..this wouldn't have happened.

2256
02:10:30,791 --> 02:10:33,083
Don't cry, dear. Don't cry.

2257
02:10:33,916 --> 02:10:38,958
Can anyone predict an accident?
No one can. No one can.

2258
02:10:39,250 --> 02:10:40,458
No one can predict it.

2259
02:10:41,333 --> 02:10:43,833
Don't cry. Don't cry, dear.
- Why did this happen, Noor?

2260
02:10:44,291 --> 02:10:46,000
"She doesn't understand."

2261
02:10:46,083 --> 02:10:49,500
You were the only Noor for me.

2262
02:10:49,708 --> 02:10:51,750
"She doesn't understand."

2263
02:10:52,625 --> 02:10:55,541
Brother, where is
the room for the super?

2264
02:10:55,625 --> 02:10:56,750
That side.

2265
02:10:56,833 --> 02:10:57,958
"She doesn't understand."

2266
02:10:58,041 --> 02:10:59,250
"She doesn't understand."

2267
02:10:59,375 --> 02:11:01,166
"She doesn't understand."

2268
02:11:01,208 --> 02:11:02,375
You?

2269
02:11:02,666 --> 02:11:06,083
He is the one whom Joi had
gone to meet in Kolkata.

2270
02:11:07,333 --> 02:11:08,583
How is Joi?

2271
02:11:17,666 --> 02:11:19,416
Joi.

2272
02:11:20,541 --> 02:11:23,208
Joi.

2273
02:11:23,250 --> 02:11:25,333
What is this? Why have
you crowded the ICU?

2274
02:11:25,416 --> 02:11:28,041
Why are you crying like that?
- Go, go, go. Go out.

2275
02:11:28,125 --> 02:11:29,375
Let the patient take rest.

2276
02:11:29,458 --> 02:11:31,125
Go. Go, go, go, go, go.

2277
02:11:37,041 --> 02:11:38,791
What is it? Why is there
such a huge crowd here?

2278
02:11:38,875 --> 02:11:40,833
Go, go and clear the gate first.

2279
02:11:41,166 --> 02:11:43,458
Let him go inside, please.

2280
02:11:46,791 --> 02:11:49,333
Okay, go. But not for a long time.

2281
02:12:16,416 --> 02:12:17,958
You won't talk to me, right?

2282
02:12:19,750 --> 02:12:20,916
You will keep quiet?

2283
02:12:23,041 --> 02:12:24,166
Please.

2284
02:12:26,208 --> 02:12:28,000
Open your eyes once.

2285
02:12:30,666 --> 02:12:32,333
Open your eyes once. Please.

2286
02:12:32,708 --> 02:12:34,416
Please don't remain quiet.

2287
02:12:34,500 --> 02:12:37,541
Please talk to me once. Please.

2288
02:12:43,958 --> 02:12:47,458
On that day at Kolkata, you spoke
so much and bothered me so much.

2289
02:12:47,916 --> 02:12:49,375
Why are you lying down quietly today?

2290
02:12:51,125 --> 02:12:52,208
You really like it, right?

2291
02:12:55,375 --> 02:12:56,458
It is fun for you.

2292
02:12:57,791 --> 02:13:00,041
Your parents and
sister are crying outside.

2293
02:13:00,125 --> 02:13:01,333
But you like it.

2294
02:13:13,166 --> 02:13:14,291
Trust me.

2295
02:13:17,291 --> 02:13:24,333
I hadn't thought that I am
going to meet you like this.

2296
02:14:09,208 --> 02:14:12,291
I am Joita.

2297
02:14:16,458 --> 02:14:17,875
And I am Abhi.

2298
02:14:18,416 --> 02:14:21,541
Abhik. Abhik.

2299
02:14:24,250 --> 02:14:28,166
I had gone to Malda to professor.

2300
02:14:28,208 --> 02:14:29,625
I had thought of going to
Balurghat to look for you.

2301
02:14:30,791 --> 02:14:33,166
I had gone to Kolkata to your
sister's house for your address.

2302
02:14:34,625 --> 02:14:38,166
But your sister has changed the
house and I didn't get your address.

2303
02:14:38,250 --> 02:14:40,333
You know? I..

2304
02:14:46,666 --> 02:14:47,791
I love you.

2305
02:14:49,833 --> 02:14:52,833
"She doesn't understand."

2306
02:14:52,916 --> 02:14:54,583
"She doesn't understand."

2307
02:14:55,708 --> 02:14:57,458
What happened? What happened?

2308
02:14:58,333 --> 02:14:59,500
Are you in pain?

2309
02:15:00,083 --> 02:15:01,458
Sister. Doctor.

2310
02:15:01,541 --> 02:15:02,916
"She doesn't understand."
- What happened?

2311
02:15:03,166 --> 02:15:04,333
Why are you doing that?

2312
02:15:04,375 --> 02:15:05,916
Where is it paining?
Where is it paining?

2313
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:07,166
"She doesn't understand."

2314
02:15:07,208 --> 02:15:08,500
Sister. Sister.

2315
02:15:09,083 --> 02:15:11,750
One minute. Sister. Doctor.

2316
02:16:16,500 --> 02:16:19,250
"All the lies and the truth."

2317
02:16:19,291 --> 02:16:21,791
"The day is telling
us while passing by."

2318
02:16:21,875 --> 02:16:24,708
"The heart is dying in restlessness."

2319
02:16:24,791 --> 02:16:26,541
"What is the solution?"

2320
02:16:27,291 --> 02:16:29,791
"I know dreams don't come true."

2321
02:16:29,875 --> 02:16:31,166
Ria, I love you. Ria.

2322
02:16:31,250 --> 02:16:33,166
I will accept you the way you are.

2323
02:16:33,250 --> 02:16:35,625
Ria. I can just stay with you.

2324
02:16:38,125 --> 02:16:40,791
"She doesn't understand."

2325
02:16:40,875 --> 02:16:43,000
"She doesn't understand."

2326
02:16:43,083 --> 02:16:45,666
Let me tell you something.
You can call it an advice.

2327
02:16:45,750 --> 02:16:46,875
"She doesn't understand."

2328
02:16:46,958 --> 02:16:48,916
The next time, you meet
a girl at the bus stand..

2329
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:51,458
..then don't bunk office,
waste a leave..

2330
02:16:51,541 --> 02:16:54,583
..and leave the bike
behind by mistake.

2331
02:16:54,666 --> 02:16:55,916
"She doesn't understand."

2332
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:57,166
Don't be so good.

2333
02:16:57,250 --> 02:16:58,583
"She doesn't understand."
- Become a little clever.

2334
02:16:59,208 --> 02:17:01,166
'Come to our house if
you come to Balurghat.'

2335
02:17:01,250 --> 02:17:02,708
"She doesn't understand."
- 'I owe you a favor.'

2336
02:17:02,750 --> 02:17:04,125
'I will pay back with interest.'

2337
02:17:04,166 --> 02:17:05,250
"She doesn't understand."

2338
02:17:05,333 --> 02:17:06,666
"She doesn't understand."

2339
02:17:07,875 --> 02:17:10,500
"This could have been a story."

2340
02:17:10,583 --> 02:17:13,375
"A few pages could have been torn."

2341
02:17:13,458 --> 02:17:18,041
"I would have kept it
hidden and preserved."

2342
02:17:18,625 --> 02:17:21,291
"I know it will come again."

2343
02:17:21,375 --> 02:17:24,000
"With a feeling of a palanquin."

2344
02:17:24,083 --> 02:17:29,166
"And then it will
leave me alone and go."

2345
02:17:29,500 --> 02:17:32,291
"She doesn't understand."

2346
02:17:32,375 --> 02:17:34,375
"She doesn't understand."

2347
02:17:34,916 --> 02:17:37,666
"She doesn't understand."

2348
02:17:37,750 --> 02:17:39,833
"She doesn't understand."

2349
02:17:40,250 --> 02:17:43,166
"She doesn't understand."

2350
02:17:43,208 --> 02:17:45,208
"She doesn't understand."

2351
02:17:45,833 --> 02:17:48,375
"She doesn't understand."

2352
02:17:48,458 --> 02:17:50,000
You shouldn't drive the
car in a drunken state.

2353
02:17:50,083 --> 02:17:51,416
We could have called a taxi.

2354
02:17:51,500 --> 02:17:54,166
Hey, forget it. Nothing will happen.

2355
02:17:54,208 --> 02:17:56,041
"She doesn't understand."
"She doesn't understand."

2356
02:17:56,083 --> 02:17:57,916
Hey, if you are sleepy,
tell me, I will drive.

2357
02:17:58,000 --> 02:17:59,125
Hey, yes, yes, I am fine.

2358
02:18:01,250 --> 02:18:03,333
Why are you talking on the
phone while driving, son?

2359
02:18:03,416 --> 02:18:04,541
Father, please.

2360
02:18:05,125 --> 02:18:07,125
Ashok, I have a
meeting at 12 tomorrow.

2361
02:18:07,166 --> 02:18:08,375
Reach there.

2362
02:18:13,125 --> 02:18:15,458
Father, drive slower.
I am feeling scared.

2363
02:18:15,541 --> 02:18:17,125
I am very late, dear.

2364
02:18:32,500 --> 02:18:35,416
"She doesn't understand."

2365
02:18:35,500 --> 02:18:37,541
"She doesn't understand."

2366
02:18:38,083 --> 02:18:40,541
"She doesn't understand."

2367
02:18:40,625 --> 02:18:42,875
"She doesn't understand."

2368
02:18:43,416 --> 02:18:46,083
"She doesn't understand."

2369
02:18:46,166 --> 02:18:48,125
"She doesn't understand."

2370
02:18:48,833 --> 02:18:51,625
"She doesn't understand."

2371
02:18:51,708 --> 02:18:53,708
"She doesn't understand."

2372
02:18:54,208 --> 02:18:56,916
"She doesn't understand."

2373
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:58,958
"She doesn't understand."

2374
02:18:59,583 --> 02:19:02,083
"She doesn't understand."

2375
02:19:02,166 --> 02:19:04,458
"She doesn't understand."

2376
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:07,791
"She doesn't understand."

2377
02:19:07,875 --> 02:19:09,833
"She doesn't understand."

2378
02:19:10,416 --> 02:19:13,166
"She doesn't understand."

2379
02:19:13,250 --> 02:19:15,208
"She doesn't understand."

2380
02:19:15,708 --> 02:19:18,500
"She doesn't understand."

2381
02:19:18,583 --> 02:19:20,708
"She doesn't understand."

2382
02:19:21,125 --> 02:19:23,875
"She doesn't understand."

2383
02:19:23,958 --> 02:19:26,250
"She doesn't understand."

2384
02:19:26,583 --> 02:19:28,958
"She doesn't understand."

2385
02:19:29,250 --> 02:19:31,916
"She doesn't understand."

2386
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:33,291
"She doesn't understand."
