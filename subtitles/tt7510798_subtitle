1
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:46,760
'MAARI 2'

2
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,480
Move it.

3
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,360
Go

4
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,240
What's your name?

5
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,280
Gangadhar Beeja.

6
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,240
- Thanatos.
- What does that mean?

7
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,680
God of Death.

8
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,680
He means he's the God of Death.

9
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,320
He's given himself that name.

10
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,080
If you want to kill someone in prison,
he is your man.

11
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,720
No matter who the target is,
he'll get them.

12
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,640
He reads a lot of English books
and blabbers like this.

13
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,040
But he's good at what he does.

14
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,560
But our gig is not in the prison.
It's at a public place.

15
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,920
He will do it.

16
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,840
Good evening, sir.
- Go out for a while.

17
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,480
Wait.

18
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,880
Someone's coming.

19
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,560
What's that in your mouth?

20
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,520
Boss...

21
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,880
- Boss!
- What?

22
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,000
They're here.

23
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,400
Really?

24
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,360
Don't panic.
Just do as I say.

25
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,840
Welcome.

26
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,320
Have a seat.

27
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,760
What would you
like to drink?

28
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,120
Where are you going?.

29
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,120
Don't leave!

30
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,120
- Finish your meal.
- I'm out of here.

31
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,920
I'm looking for someone.

32
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,240
Who?

33
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,920
Who are you looking for?

34
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,320
Shut up!

35
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,360
A gangster from Madras has come here.

36
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:50,320
I know he's been coming to this bar
at this time for the last few days.

37
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,800
One moment.

38
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,040
Here!

39
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,080
What's this?

40
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,080
He asked me to give you this
if you come here and threaten us.

41
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,200
Who?

42
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,800
Maari.

43
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,800
Read it.

44
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,280
I will count from 1 to 5...

45
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,680
go back to where you came from.

46
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,160
Or...

47
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,440
Or what?

48
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,560
Who are you messing with?

49
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,560
Playing games with me?

50
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:26,200
Now, I'm telling you the same thing.
I'll count to 5.

51
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,440
If you don't tell me where he is...

52
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,200
I'll just shoot down
all of you!

53
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,120
Now, tell me...
where is he?

54
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,520
Tell me!

55
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,640
One.

56
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,600
You're counting down
to your own death?

57
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,880
One.

58
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,600
Two.

59
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,600
Three.

60
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,400
Four.

61
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,680
Fi--

62
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,160
How is it?

63
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,160
Bro...bro

64
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,640
The bad guy is over there.

65
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,240
- Maari!
- That guy is so scary.

66
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,520
Stop that.

67
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,080
I don't care that he's a child.
I'll slit his throat.

68
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,240
Curly-Wurly is being mean.

69
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,360
Like hell you will.

70
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,520
You think I won't do it?

71
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,080
I'm a very bad man.

72
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,200
Oh yeah?

73
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,240
What a show-off! He had a gun all along
but fought them anyway?

74
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,040
I'm a bad man to bad men.

75
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,920
Saturday!

76
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,760
Punch-bag!

77
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,920
Curly-Wurly!

78
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,920
You can plot to kill me in Madras...

79
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,920
or plan an attack outside my turf.

80
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:57,320
But I'll know about it
even before my hit-man.

81
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,920
You can't get me in my hood,
so you attack me outside?

82
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,800
I'll finish you off!

83
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,680
'It's impossible to kill someone
who is not afraid of death.'

84
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,640
That's Maari's philosophy.

85
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,720
So far, there have been
99 attempts at his life.

86
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,640
This is the 100th attempt.

87
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,160
It's a record!

88
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,320
They've tried every trick in the book.

89
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,240
Nothing worked.

90
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,640
Somehow, I get caught in the middle.

91
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,920
Let's go to the cinema tomorrow.

92
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,240
- Nurse...
- One second.

93
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,920
What is it?
- I'm hurt.

94
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,640
- Where?
- Right here.

95
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,920
He called the doctor himself,
threatened him to attend night duty...

96
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,680
and got himself operated!

97
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,040
As last resort, I tried poisoning his food,
but even that didn't work!

98
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:08,280
The alcohol in his booze cancelled out
the poison in his food.

99
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,840
So much booze!

100
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,360
What happened, Maari?
- Nurse! Doctor!

101
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,520
Wait...wait

102
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,560
Maari?

103
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,720
Yes!

104
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,520
I'm the first doctor to prescribe
an antacid for a case of poisoning!

105
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,600
We stabbed him.

106
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,560
Shot him.

107
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,160
Even poisoned him.

108
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,160
He just refuses to die.

109
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:31,200
When so many attempts are made
to kill Maari, our boys do retaliate.

110
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:34,800
Maari forbids it, but there is one guy
who just won't have it.

111
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,120
Kalai - Maari's best friend.

112
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,480
Kalai is Velu's son.

113
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,040
Oh God! Save me!

114
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,000
Though Maari is surrounded by
many people, Kalai is his best friend.

115
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,840
Jesus!

116
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,480
Kalai is a big gun,
but he has one weakness.

117
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,440
Cocaine.

118
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,840
At one point, his father's
main business was cocaine.

119
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,760
Maari doesn't even touch that stuff.

120
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,560
But Kalai slowly got addicted.

121
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:15,040
Then it was Maari who struggled
to get Kalai out of his addiction.

122
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,480
Dude, don't cry!
Stop crying.

123
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,080
You're my Deva.
I'm your Surya.

124
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,680
But Deva dies in the film!

125
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,040
'Coal' Velu.

126
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,640
Back then, the mere mention of his name
would make the hood go quiet.

127
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,840
It's been over a year
since he died.

128
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,840
After Velu's death...

129
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,440
everyone including Kalai
asked Maari to take charge.

130
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,920
Maari is like Tendulkar.

131
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,280
He is at his best game
when he isn't the captain!

132
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,640
Kalai is Velu's heir.

133
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,840
His younger brother, Vallavan,
will stand by him.

134
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,160
I'll stand by both of them.

135
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,160
My first decision
as the leader is...

136
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,360
Maari will henceforth have
all decision making powers.

137
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:01,400
The leader of our opposite gang
made the most out of Velu's death.

138
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,800
Singayya.

139
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,520
Without Velu's influence, we do our best
to hold Singayya's gang at bay.

140
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:16,920
With the constant trouble we give him,
he's really pissed off with us.

141
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,800
Over half the attempts to kill Maari
were plotted by him.

142
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,920
It was this Baldie who sent those men
at the 100th attempt to kill Maari.

143
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,080
Though the entire hood
is under his control...

144
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,160
Maari is always out of control.

145
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,560
I've got a garland!
Here...

146
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,560
- What's this?
- We're celebrating the 100th attempt!

147
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,640
Okay!

148
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,080
Come here, boys.

149
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,240
Burst it!

150
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,800
Get going!

151
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,160
'Unruly'

152
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,920
Hi, darling!

153
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,800
Shame!

154
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,240
Don't you have any sense?
Is that how you drive?

155
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,360
I learnt it all from my Rowdy Baby.

156
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,200
You know what, darling?
When I heard you're here...

157
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,520
I cancelled two Ola bookings,
knocked down the dividers on my way...

158
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,560
and rushed here to see you!

159
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,120
But you greet me with a frown?

160
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,120
Let go of my hand.
Let go!

161
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,320
If you go around telling people
we're in love...

162
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,200
I'll smash your face in.

163
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,800
I must not tell anyone?

164
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,440
We're secret lovers?

165
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,880
Go away!

166
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,880
Go!

167
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,280
Maari, let's walk away.

168
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,520
I don't want it!

169
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,000
Don't pretend like you
don't like me.

170
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:50,680
Brother, would he have bought
me an auto if he didn't like me?

171
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,440
Tell her why I
bought her that auto.

172
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,600
Tell her, Saturday!

173
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,760
So that you will drive the auto...
instead of driving us crazy.

174
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,000
But why would he give me
'his' auto to drive?

175
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,240
She has a point there.

176
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,640
Girl, you leave now.

177
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,440
Call me lovingly by my name 'Anandi'...

178
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,800
and I'll leave.

179
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,880
Shall I call you by your name?

180
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,400
Anandi!

181
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,000
Look at her gait!

182
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,880
Look at her smile!

183
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,200
Hi, Maari.

184
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,640
Slap her, Maari

185
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,920
- Hi, Anandi.
- He didn't mean you.

186
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,320
I did.

187
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,560
Do you want 'Unruly' Anandi
or 'Awful' Anandi?

188
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,080
You decide your fate.

189
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,520
Maari has always been awful.

190
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,160
And Maari is into Awful.

191
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,920
Come on, Maari!
I'm feeling so 'sky'.

192
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,280
That's 'shy', not sky!

193
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:42,520
If you dare touch him,
I'll break your arms.

194
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,480
Darling!

195
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,600
You're all by yourself.

196
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,600
If we get married, I can cook for you,
take care of you and our home!

197
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,000
We can be so happy!

198
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,240
Why do you refuse?

199
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,360
There are women out there
achieving so much...

200
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,040
And you're blabbering about
cooking and cleaning.

201
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,200
Get out of my face.

202
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,400
I'm a working lady, too.

203
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,760
I'm not a jobless loafer
like them.

204
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,000
Thank you!

205
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,000
I'm not counting on you
to support me...

206
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,360
nor do I need to cook and clean
for the rest of my life.

207
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,040
What I have for you...
is 'true love you'.

208
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,920
Me too.

209
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,520
I sincerely...

210
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,040
seriously...

211
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,280
mean this.

212
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,480
I want this Anandi.

213
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,880
- No!
- Why?

214
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,240
- My family won't accept this.
- We won't accept that!

215
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,440
Then...

216
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,120
Maari will forever be solo.

217
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,600
Enough of your silly talk.
Get going.

218
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,120
I'm not one of those silly girls
you see in the movies.

219
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,240
I'm Maari's girl.
A gutsy girl.

220
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,880
Hey, Silly!

221
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,840
Your auto is over there.

222
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,320
- Do we make a good pair?
- We were just joking.

223
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,080
You can put this garland
on your auto.

224
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,520
- Maari!
- I'm there for you.

225
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,120
Did you just call me by my name?

226
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,480
I'll knock your teeth off.

227
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,440
- Go away.
- You said You loved me.

228
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,640
Normally, Maari tortures
everyone in the hood.

229
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:10,200
But the only person who has the
might and power to torture Maari...

230
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,120
is 'Unruly' Anandi.

231
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,160
Earlier, I used to get beaten up
for many different reasons.

232
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,640
These days, there's
just one reason.

233
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,200
This annoying bug.

234
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:22,160
'Unruly' Anandi is the only person
in the hood who isn't afraid of Maari.

235
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,920
But the two of us
are terrified of her.

236
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,720
Hi, Rowdy Baby!

237
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,120
Why is she calling me
'Rowdy Baby'?

238
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,440
You're ruining my life!

239
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,840
Don't disturb me.

240
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,600
- Are you talking to her or me?
- I was talking to her, of course.

241
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,080
- Think I believe you?
- Yeah.

242
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,760
Why did you give Anandi
my phone number?

243
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,880
She sends me 100 WhatsApp messages
and calls me 50 times a day.

244
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,520
What's so special about me
that Anandi keeps running behind me?

245
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,080
Yeah, I have no idea.

246
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,880
You're insulting Maari!

247
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,720
No, you said it first!

248
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,160
It's okay for me to say that.

249
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,800
- What are you supposed to say?
- What?

250
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,160
You should say I look like Kamal Hassan!

251
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,320
Correct!

252
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,520
She drew inspiration from Maari
and became an auto driver.

253
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,800
She is a rowdy herself.

254
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,600
But the moment she sees Maari,
she just melts!

255
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,400
What's the problem?

256
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,080
- Did I say that? It's our hood...
- Come on!

257
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,120
Go.

258
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,880
You know how she is.

259
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,280
We occasionally use her
to smuggle our goods in.

260
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,240
You don't trust me?
Look at my face!

261
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,400
Fine, get going.

262
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,240
She takes up all these gigs
just to impress Maari.

263
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,480
Look.

264
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,560
Take a look!

265
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,640
No matter how hard she tries,
Maari doesn't pay heed.

266
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,480
He mocks her and sends her home.

267
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,040
"I'm a don, don, don;
You can be my don all you want."

268
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,600
"It's a scene, scene, scene;
When you touch me, it's some scene."

269
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,640
"It's been a long day, my dear;
I'll be your caffeine."

270
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,800
Is this something to celebrate?

271
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,200
Happy 100th murder attempt, Maari!

272
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,360
Many more happy returns
of the day, Maari.

273
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,240
You don't say that
for such occasions.

274
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,720
What is he saying?

275
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,400
He wishes you more of this!

276
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,680
You need to watch out.
You've fought with Singayya.

277
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,840
That's nothing.

278
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,760
He can keep trying.

279
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,240
He thinks he can get my Maari?

280
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,680
This is a record!

281
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,920
We're going to rock the entire hood today!

282
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:07,480
"When he whistles, eardrums burst.'
When he flies a kite, the spool wears out."

283
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:12,160
"When Maari spins around and pounces;
You will see your mummy daddy's faces."

284
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,880
"When he whistles, eardrums burst.'
When he flies a kite, the spool wears out."

285
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,440
"When Maari spins around and pounces;
You will see your mummy daddy's faces."

286
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:22,080
"It's not your hood, you can't do a thing;
This is his jungle and he is the king."

287
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,400
"Yeah, he's the king!"

288
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:28,360
"Be a true friend and tell no lies;
And he'll protect you with his life."

289
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,720
"Oh yes, he will."

290
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:34,760
"It's not your hood, you can't do a thing;
This is his jungle and he is the king."

291
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,120
"Yeah, he's the king!"

292
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:40,880
"Be a true friend and tell no lies;
And he'll protect you with his life."

293
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,360
"Oh yes, he will."

294
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,240
Maari, are you a good person
or a bad person?

295
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,680
I don't know!

296
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:02,120
"Move out of the way, here he comes!
Just deal with it if you're jealous."

297
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:07,240
"We're something else, Maari's people;
Go Maari, go Maari, go Maari!"

298
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,240
"Tick-tock - the clock's ticking;
Walk, walk - keeping walking."

299
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,800
"There's no point trying;
The Youth Army will send you packing."

300
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,280
"Left, right - they come marching;
Break, break - barriers breaking."

301
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,760
"You are not welcome here;
Take your business elsewhere."

302
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,600
"Oh, he's soaring!"

303
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:44,680
"It's his time, he's soaring up;
You've been exposed, now cut the crap."

304
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,640
"You got caught!"

305
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:54,600
"You got caught, your attempt failed;
All your grand plans are now foiled."

306
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:59,320
"What's mine is yours, till the end;
Ask, and it shall be yours, my friend."

307
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:04,400
"I've got nothing to call mine;
I'll have your back till the end of time."

308
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,240
"Move out of the way, here he comes!
Just deal with it if you're jealous."

309
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:14,400
"We're something else, Maari's people;
Go Maari, go Maari, go Maari!"

310
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,920
"See the guts of Maari"

311
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,360
"Move...give way"

312
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,760
"See his caliber"

313
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,200
"Go...run away"

314
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:39,400
"When he whistles, eardrums burst.'
When he flies a kite, the spool wears out."

315
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:44,640
"When Maari spins around and pounces;
You will see your mummy daddy's faces."

316
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:01,040
My hood, my rules.

317
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,600
Shame!

318
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,920
I didn't expect Maari to be here.

319
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:21,880
Inspite of knowing that I sent those men,
you dared to come here!

320
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,440
It's out of trust, brother.

321
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,120
That's good.

322
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,760
It's not you I trust.
I trust myself.

323
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,240
Since my father's death, your men have
been causing trouble in our hood.

324
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,040
That needs to stop.

325
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,760
It's not so easy.

326
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,680
You said there was one last option.
What was that?

327
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:49,280
Chennai is fast becoming the
narcotics capital of South India.

328
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,000
The consignments were coming in
from Kenya all year.

329
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,320
We had no issues.
The business was running smoothly.

330
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,400
But suddenly, the customs department
has become strict.

331
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,800
Once it got too risky,
the Kenyans killed their own men...

332
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:07,640
left us in the lurch and
started distributing it on their own.

333
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,400
The Kenyan gang needs to be wiped out.

334
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:14,120
Then we need to consistently smuggle
the goods in without getting caught.

335
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,000
I know Maari can do this.

336
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,800
If you agree to this...

337
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,160
I'll spare your lives.

338
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,160
Yeah, let's get going then?

339
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,840
Kalai...

340
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,920
Think before you make a decision.

341
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,200
You know we don't
get involved with drugs.

342
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:34,840
Don't forget you're here
to bury the hatchet and make peace.

343
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,280
Boss, they can't leave this place
in one piece unless we let them go.

344
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,760
Brother, we aren't here
to fight with you.

345
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:54,280
Being calm and respectful
is good for everyone.

346
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,120
'Using drugs is a punishable crime'

347
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,000
If I'd come here to start a fight...

348
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,920
I wouldn't address
you as 'Brother'.

349
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,720
I normally address people like you
with... other words.

350
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,560
What?

351
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,120
What?

352
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,400
What?

353
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,000
I'll kill your boss?

354
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,760
Singayya, I knew you might
get jumpy at any point.

355
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:32,960
That's why I've had my gun
pointed at your crotch all along.

356
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,800
Kalai, say what you have to say.

357
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,760
He is in a mood to listen!

358
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,560
'Using drugs is a punishable crime'

359
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,960
We're laying out a condition for you.

360
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,320
Don't cross our line again.

361
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,800
The next time your men...

362
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:52,400
so much as leave a strand of hair
behind in my place of business...

363
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,360
they won't have heads left.

364
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,680
- Let's go, Maari.
- We can get him anytime, Kalai...

365
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,560
but you keep saying 'no'...

366
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,840
Kalai, think about it...

367
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:06,200
What if all those ships, cars and cranes
out there belonged to us?

368
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,040
I'll take the orange ship,
you take the white one.

369
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,880
You think we should have taken up
that cocaine gig?

370
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:12,680
What?

371
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,280
Not under Singayya, of course.

372
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:17,680
We could have figured the route,
cut him out, and done it on our own.

373
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,760
Come again?

374
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,000
We decided a long time back
that we won't get involved in drugs.

375
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,040
I was just kidding.

376
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,880
Stop kidding, then.

377
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,560
We don't need to make a living
out of such businesses.

378
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,440
We can make money anytime.
But we have good, trustworthy boys.

379
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,160
Let's do our thing.

380
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,760
I agreed to this meeting
counting on you.

381
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,560
You don't know how to
convince your own brother?

382
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,440
Then you're of no use to me.

383
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,960
I can only try.

384
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,720
I can't guarantee it.

385
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,560
Even now, I'm so nervous.

386
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,800
What if someone saw us together?

387
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,920
I thought my brother would fall
at the sight of cocaine.

388
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
But Maari is always around,
foiling our plans.

389
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,120
Vallavan...

390
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,640
I don't hold onto things
I've got no use for.

391
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,240
You got that Kenya contact through me.
Don't you forget that.

392
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,760
I can't do squat with
just the contact.

393
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,120
We need to mitigate the risk
and get the goods.

394
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,360
Can you do that?

395
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,960
How about you?

396
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,600
I needed Maari to do that for me.

397
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,880
Guess we have to do it by ourselves.

398
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,800
Tell them we'll be there tomorrow.

399
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,440
Let's try talking to them.

400
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,760
Let's go.

401
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,040
It's slanted towards one side.
Put it up properly.

402
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,520
Who did the Photoshop work?
You look fairer than me!

403
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,680
Yeah, sure!

404
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,360
Who told you that it's okay
to use Maari's picture?

405
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,880
You want me to ask Maari.
Is that it?

406
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,160
No, wait!

407
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,800
He's in a foul mood already.

408
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,440
If you annoy him, he'll hit us.

409
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,200
That's her ploy.

410
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,560
So you get it.
Tell me how to bait him!

411
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,280
You're asking this guy
for romance ideas?

412
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,960
- He's a 40 year old virgin boy.
- Shut up, Mossy-Face.

413
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,800
Only I know what kind of women
will be liked by men.

414
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,800
Like me?

415
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,400
Avoid-Face!

416
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,160
- Ignore him.
- Women need to be dainty.

417
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,560
While walking...

418
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,880
look down!

419
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:20,240
Besides, your speech should have 'lime'.

420
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,640
- What's that?
- He means the fruit.

421
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,960
- I'll squeeze lemonade out of it.
- Okay, sorry.

422
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:28,040
I meant, you need to speak
in a seductive manner.

423
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,480
For instance, you want
your auto-stand inaugurated...

424
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,560
Maari...

425
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:35,280
If you inaugurate
our auto-stand...

426
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,800
the auto business will run successfully.

427
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,480
- You know why?
- Why?

428
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,920
Ever since you inaugurated my heart...

429
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,520
my thoughts have been running wild.

430
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,440
Disgusting.
I need to do all this?

431
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,480
It looks disgusting on his face,
you can pull it off.

432
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,080
- Right?
- Your face looks rotten!

433
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,680
You talk too much.

434
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,640
Leave it

435
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,720
Maari is here.

436
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:57,120
How dare you put up
these banners here?

437
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,480
Punch-bag, she didn't even ask Maari.

438
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,400
You're in for trouble.

439
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,640
Step aside, or it looks like
you printed those banners.

440
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,960
Who told you that it's okay
to print these banners?

441
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,360
Come here.

442
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,640
Go on.

443
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,440
We should get out of here.

444
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,160
What's that?

445
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,720
Why does she look paralysed?

446
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,480
She's going to get me thrashed.

447
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,400
Is that how I walked?

448
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:32,840
The way you drive, I thought
you might get paralysed someday.

449
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,600
Wait!
Before I forget...

450
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,760
What?

451
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,640
Is she bowling?

452
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:44,560
Ever since you inaugurated my heart,
my thoughts have been running wild.

453
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,040
So...

454
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:50,240
if you inaugurate my auto-stand,
it will run successfully.

455
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,440
What say?

456
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,840
I told her to speak seductively.
She's talking like an old lady.

457
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,680
You're looking at me with love, darling?

458
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,800
Brother, you're awesome!

459
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,600
It worked.

460
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,320
- I'm done for.
- Let's run away.

461
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,480
He's looking.

462
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,200
I told you to wash the Jeep,
but you're giving her 'love advice'?

463
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,000
He even taught her
how to walk.

464
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,000
How dare you?

465
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,000
Don't hit him, Maari.

466
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,560
I'm hitting them because I can't hit you.

467
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,400
I'm giving you five minutes
to take down all the banners.

468
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,040
You hooked me up with that Sridevi girl...

469
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,160
So you won't attend the inauguration?

470
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,600
Looks like she won't stop
till she gets us killed.

471
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,560
- She's pissing him off.
- Why won't she understand?

472
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,440
- Why won't she understand?
- Okay, let them go!

473
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:40,000
- Vallava, you told them we're coming?
- Yeah, I don't know why no one's here.

474
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,120
You've killed everyone.

475
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,280
Why are you waiting for me?

476
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,360
You can take the goods
and walk away.

477
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,680
This is not what I want.

478
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,680
Then?

479
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,360
What is it you want?

480
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,480
Maari.

481
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:21,040
What's your rivalry with Maari?

482
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,320
Eight years back,

483
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,480
I killed a gangster
and went to prison.

484
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,200
Only after I went in
did I realise...

485
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:34,120
Half the inmates there
belonged to his gang.

486
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,400
My brother was a big-shot lawyer.

487
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:45,360
He was the defence lawyer
for all the major gangsters in Chennai.

488
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,280
Beeja, they've thrashed you so badly.

489
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,920
Just hold on for another two days.

490
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,960
I'll get you out somehow.

491
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,640
I can take it...

492
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,320
but I don't know if
my body can.

493
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,040
You killed that man for me.

494
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,120
You're all the family I've got.

495
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,520
I won't let you down.

496
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,040
I was very hopeful.

497
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,600
But after two days...

498
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Hold him down.

499
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,200
You know, we killed your brother?

500
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:12,240
We got him last night.
He died on the spot.

501
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,840
- You're going to die here.
- Drown him!

502
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,880
What they said, is it true?

503
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,080
Yeah, it's confirmed news.

504
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:19,880
Who?

505
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,120
A man called Maari.
Some new gangster.

506
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:26,440
That's the first time
I heard that name, Maari.

507
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,000
When you go through
unbearable torture...

508
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,920
you either die right there...

509
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,920
Or you turn
into a new person.

510
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,400
But I turned into a new beast.

511
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,440
The new warden
is being such a pain.

512
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,880
Let him be...

513
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,720
- What happened?
- Must be a voltage drop.

514
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,600
Who is that?

515
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:18,200
That day, Beeja turned into Thanatos.

516
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:21,160
Thirty three murders inside prison.

517
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,800
I became the God of Death.

518
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,280
No matter how many people I killed...

519
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:29,000
my thirst for retribution won't be quenched
till I kill one man.

520
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:33,280
The man who killed my brother,
and made me suffer inside a prison cell.

521
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,680
Maari.

522
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,120
You've killed so many people
all by yourself...

523
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,280
but you can't get Maari?

524
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,800
He shouldn't die easily.

525
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:52,120
The pain I suffered
stuck inside that prison...

526
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,200
I want him to suffer that pain.

527
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,680
And then I will kill him.

528
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,200
I'm going to achieve that
with two things.

529
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,320
One - this!

530
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,040
Two...

531
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,920
I understand your anger.

532
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,360
But instead of complicating things,
just kill him right away.

533
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:19,040
I'll give you more drugs and money
than you can imagine.

534
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,600
Men without goals seek money.

535
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,720
Men with weak hearts seek intoxication.

536
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:28,560
My ambition and intoxication
are one and the same.

537
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,200
Death.

538
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,280
I am the God of Death.

539
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,720
Maari has defied Death.

540
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,440
We'd be worthy adversaries.

541
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,760
It's not just that I don't want
to kill Maari easily...

542
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,640
It's not possible, either.

543
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,440
This is my offer.

544
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,920
It's my way, or no way!

545
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:58,960
We absolutely need a punch line here.

546
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,920
What are you scholars up to?

547
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,520
We're working on punch lines.

548
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,920
- What?
- Punch lines.

549
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,720
There's thunder and lightning before rain.
When Maari hits, it's only pain.

550
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,040
He's going to hit you.

551
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,240
That makes no sense.

552
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,480
It had a nice rhyme.

553
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,920
- Hear mine!
- Tell me.

554
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:20,880
Church-bells ring on Sunday.
It's the day after Saturday.

555
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,920
There's no 'Maari' in this.

556
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:23,760
Yes?

557
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,200
These are out of fashion

558
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,960
He wrote many things
He forgot it

559
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,320
You're writing punch lines
for yourself?

560
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,880
It was a mistake.
Now, here's one for you.

561
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,760
Tell me

562
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,920
If you are bad,
I am your dad.

563
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:36,840
Meaning?

564
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,600
- If you're bad--
- Dare to point your finger at me?

565
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,920
...I'm your dad.

566
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,920
If you are bad,
I am your dad.

567
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,520
- Say it in English.
- English?

568
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,160
Say it.

569
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,960
If you are bad,
I am your dad.

570
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:48,960
That's all.

571
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,360
- I need to try it on someone.
- Here He comes.

572
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,640
Kalai...

573
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,160
Want to hear a punch line?

574
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,760
If you're bawd, I'm your dad.

575
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,920
- How is it?
- How is it?

576
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,640
- Who taught you this?
- He did.

577
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,120
It was him, not me.

578
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,320
- Didn't know it was a cuss word...
- What happened?

579
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,040
Not me...He only wrote it

580
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,960
That is 'bad'

581
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:20,880
It's a simple gig.

582
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,040
Your girlfriend Anandi,
the auto driver, can do it.

583
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,760
I've told you, there's nothing
between us.

584
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,160
I know.

585
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,600
But if you give her some work,
she does it with extra interest.

586
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,160
So what?

587
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,040
A consignment arrives
from Malaysia every day.

588
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:37,520
Foreign perfumes and soaps,
5.1 speakers, bodybuilding supplements etc.

589
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,480
When our boys go,
they get unwanted attention.

590
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,400
If that girl goes instead,
she can get away with ease.

591
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,360
No one will doubt her.

592
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,120
What should I do?
You tell her yourself!

593
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,600
Maari, she won't listen to me.
You should put in a word.

594
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:48,960
Is it safe work?

595
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,760
One hundred percent safe.
It's almost legal!

596
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,240
Saturday, you go tell her.

597
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,000
Tell her I gave her the job.

598
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,960
Go with her for the first few days
to make sure it's safe.

599
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:00,920
So he does care about her.

600
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:01,880
Bro...

601
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,160
'All I want to say is that,
they don't really care about us.'

602
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,000
I'll slap you.

603
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,640
Thanks, Maari.

604
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,480
What is Kalai up to?

605
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,920
- He is at home.
- Ask him to stay put.

606
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,640
They start a rumour
and believe it to be true.

607
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,240
On behalf of the
Women's Self-Help Committee...

608
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,400
here to make this occasion special...

609
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,720
is Chennai's new Collector,
Vijaya Chamundeswari.

610
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,800
We'd like to give her a warm welcome.

611
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:31,040
Accepting our invitation,
here to grace this occasion...

612
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:34,040
the lion-heart of our hood!
A man who is pure gold!

613
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:37,360
See, Maari didn't come to our inauguration
but he's come for this.

614
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,560
Maybe he agreed because those girls
went and asked him.

615
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,640
I should have gone instead of you.
He would have agreed.

616
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,240
- So much trash!
- Luckily I'm wearing slippers.

617
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,360
We should clean it up.

618
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,440
Okay

619
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,680
I'm really pissed.
Cut you crap.

620
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,400
Get lost.

621
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:58,360
To encourage the lady auto-drivers,
Maari will present five free autos!

622
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:02,040
We request him to present them.

623
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,080
Look there

624
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,880
You think you're the only girl
Maari gifted an auto to?

625
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,320
He's giving it to random women.

626
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,480
'Unruly', see my man up there?

627
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,680
- Goodbye!
- I need to speak to you in private.

628
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,360
I only have two minutes.
I need to go and drink.

629
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,240
All the illegal business here:
the rowdyism, smuggling...

630
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:26,000
committed by Singayya, Kalai,
and even you.

631
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,280
I know all about this.

632
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,240
I don't know what my
predecessors were like.

633
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,280
But I'm not like them.

634
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,440
I will put an end to this.

635
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:34,040
I asked around, and they said
good things about you.

636
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,200
- It's the truth!
- They do say good things.

637
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:42,120
Help me, and we can put an end to this.

638
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,760
You can treat this as a request,
or a warning.

639
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,160
Warning?

640
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,480
Madam...

641
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:54,760
Don't judge me by what you saw
on that stage.

642
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,680
That was a different Maari.

643
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,400
But I'm a different Maari.

644
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,480
I'm the worst of them all.

645
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:06,280
Madam, you can't do a thing to us.

646
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,440
You know why?

647
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,520
You have to play by the rules.

648
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:12,640
But we've got no rules at all.
We play it any way we like.

649
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,720
These days, if you want to do good,
you need to be a bad person.

650
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,680
Stop joking around.

651
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,520
Whether you decide to cooperate or not...

652
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,080
I'm going to get this done.

653
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,040
If you're with me, you'll be out here.

654
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,440
Or, you'll be behind bars.

655
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,880
Really?

656
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,880
You speak without fear.

657
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,360
I like your courage.

658
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,280
Very good!
Leave, now.

659
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,960
Get home soon, it's late.

660
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:51,600
- The way she spoke...
- It was something else!

661
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,880
They say I do good for the people?

662
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,040
That's alright.

663
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,440
But she can't talk to us that way.

664
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,400
You dare to attack our Maari?

665
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,680
Come, face us.

666
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,480
My heart aches!

667
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,440
When I catch you...

668
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,160
Don't forget, he's the hero.

669
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,240
What?

670
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,560
I was feeling...

671
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,000
See his acting!

672
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,400
It doesn't suit you.

673
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,280
Attempt number 101.
Let's go.

674
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:14,880
Really?

675
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,760
- You set this up?
- It was you, wasn't it?

676
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,440
I knew it.
You want to kill us off?

677
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,280
Looks like you've been planning this
for a while now?

678
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,040
Maari!

679
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,440
Why are you sleeping
in so late?

680
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,720
What's this?

681
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,040
You got slashed?

682
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,520
You haven't even bandaged it.
It will get infected.

683
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:38,880
It's like a mosquito bite for Maari.
One SMACK! and ZAP! It's finished.

684
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,000
He is running a high fever.

685
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,880
I trust you two with him...

686
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,040
and this is how
you take care of him?

687
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:52,960
Maari, let's go to the hospital.
You need to get a tetanus injection.

688
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,880
No hospital.

689
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,120
What happened?

690
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,280
He is afraid of needles, that's all!

691
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,360
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah!

692
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:07,880
Maari, you're afraid of needles?

693
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,200
Me? Afraid of needles?

694
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:13,280
I've been slashed with machetes.
Don't look at me like the devil.

695
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,200
Fine, this is just a small wound.

696
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,960
We can treat it with tablets.

697
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,520
- What are you doing?
- Blowing helps the wound heal.

698
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,480
- We'll do a complete health check up?
- Sure, sister.

699
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:29,280
No need for all that.
Just give him the injection.

700
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:33,480
You said there'd be no injection!
You lied to me...

701
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,520
You're no father of mine.

702
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,720
Traitor!

703
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,040
Traitor...

704
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,920
Show me your back.

705
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,080
I may die, but I will not
get stabbed in the back!

706
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:52,200
Though you're a warrior, you can't
get an injection on your chest!

707
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:56,440
This is a strong injection.
We have to give it on your bottom.

708
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,440
Don't be shy.

709
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,960
She'd have surely
seen many bottoms!

710
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,560
- What?
- I meant, while you gave injections.

711
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,200
It will be done in no time.
You can hold my hand.

712
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:05,480
See green color, bro

713
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,360
Be gentle.

714
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,640
Maari, not so hard.

715
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,880
Maari, it hurts.

716
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,160
Maari, Maari, Maari...

717
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,160
Maari!

718
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:20,960
We've run a complete check up
including blood tests and scans.

719
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,960
- You can collect the results tomorrow.
- Give him good grades.

720
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,640
Son, the injection we gave
you is a bit strong.

721
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,560
You'll feel dizzy for a while.

722
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,400
Nurse-From-The-Past...

723
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,200
So much hype for a tiny injection?

724
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:36,480
I can chug down a full bottle
and carry out my rowdy duties.

725
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,320
- Look how my darling sleeps!
- On his tummy.

726
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,600
He only looks rough and tough.

727
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,920
But he's a child at heart.

728
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,960
Don't coddle him too much.

729
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,400
He's got a perfect shot at your face.
He'll punch you.

730
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:57,080
Saturday, your ideas...

731
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,600
they're ancient, like you.

732
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,960
Get lost.

733
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,120
You see my darling here?

734
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,960
How he encouraged the women
of our hood yesterday!

735
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,320
We saw that.

736
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,680
There's a reason
why I fell in love with him.

737
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,120
Now he's reminded me that
all over again.

738
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,440
Where were you, sister?
Why are you so late?

739
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,960
I was so worried...

740
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,920
Why are you crying?

741
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,600
Did something happen?

742
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:23,560
You promised
your brother you'd bail him out?

743
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:26,880
If we kill him inside prison,
it's one less thing to worry about.

744
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,280
You've taken money from me
for that included.

745
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,720
Just money won't cut it.

746
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,360
You know about my weakness.

747
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:52,800
Don't...

748
00:43:58,360 --> 00:43:59,800
Why are you crying?

749
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,720
Who will marry me now?

750
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:04,120
Everyone will say I'm spoilt...

751
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,960
You're not some object
to get spoilt!

752
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:08,440
Get it?

753
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,760
A woman should be viewed
as a human, not an object.

754
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,400
Till you find such a man, stay single.
Nothing wrong in that.

755
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,360
Even from a young age,
Maari knew to respect women.

756
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,840
I wanted to fall in love
with a man like that.

757
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:22,200
But it's been one-sided so far.

758
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,480
Hope he's still asleep?

759
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,840
If Maari knew about this,
things might work out.

760
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:26,640
Shall I tell him?

761
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,360
No!
Don't tell Maari.

762
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:31,520
At least he makes fun of me now.
Then he will stop that, too.

763
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,960
Someday, my darling will understand.

764
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:36,040
Till then, this is enough.

765
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,400
Even this is a jolly good feeling!

766
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,000
My rowdy baby!

767
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:11,320
"Hey, my fizzy cold drink;
My spicy hot sauce!"

768
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:14,560
"I'm your little puppy;
Take me, take me."

769
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:19,040
"Hey, my silky soft thing;
My smoking hot chick."

770
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:22,200
"Dripping with love;
Talk me, talk me."

771
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:29,960
"My dear prince, just say the word;
And we can cuddle, all day long!"

772
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:37,880
"My dear princess, you rock my dreams;
When we get together, it's fireworks!"

773
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:42,640
"Come, let's hit the beach;
And dance to some beats."

774
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:45,720
"You are my rowdy baby!"

775
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:50,560
"Come, you're my only girlfriend;
Here, I've got you flowers."

776
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:53,560
"We'll make us new trend, baby!"

777
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:56,840
"Let's go"

778
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:58,720
"Come up"

779
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,680
"Rowdy baby!"

780
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,840
"Girl Friend!"

781
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,960
"Flower bouquet"

782
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:09,760
"Trend baby"

783
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:16,960
"Rowdy baby!"

784
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:24,800
"Rowdy baby!"

785
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:48,160
"You've got my mood all worked up;
My hormone-u balance-u damage-u."

786
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:56,120
"Hey, Kamakshi! My Meenakshi!
Maari's got his eyes on you."

787
00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:03,640
"One plus one is two, my love.
You plus me is three, my love."

788
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:11,480
"Hey, Jhansi Rani! My Krishnaveni.
I'll buy you a pony, come ride it."

789
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:19,520
"Hey, Magician! You're a smooth operator.
I'm part of you, we're the perfect pair."

790
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,280
"Rowdy baby!"

791
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:23,040
"Rowdy baby!"

792
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,760
"Rowdy baby!"

793
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:30,960
"Rowdy baby!"

794
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,040
"Rowdy baby!"

795
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,920
"Rowdy baby!"

796
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:39,680
"Hey, my fizzy cold drink;
My spicy hot sauce!"

797
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:43,080
"I'm your little puppy;
Take me, take me."

798
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:47,440
"Hey, my silky soft thing;
My smoking hot hunk."

799
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:50,880
"Dripping with love;
Talk me, talk me."

800
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:58,400
"My dear prince, just say the word;
And we can cuddle, all day long."

801
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:06,320
"My dear princess, you rock my dreams;
When we get together, it's fireworks."

802
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:10,880
"Come, let's hit the beach;
And dance to some beats."

803
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,960
"You are my rowdy baby!"

804
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:18,840
"Come, you're my only girlfriend;
Here, I've got you flowers."

805
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:21,720
"We'll make us new trend, baby!"

806
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:23,800
"Rowdy baby!"

807
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:25,560
"Rowdy baby!"

808
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
"Rowdy baby!"

809
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:28,360
"Rowdy baby!"

810
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,120
"Rowdy baby!"

811
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:48,920
"Rowdy baby!"

812
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,000
"Rowdy baby!"

813
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:56,440
"Rowdy baby!"

814
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,520
"Rowdy baby!"

815
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,480
"Rowdy baby!"

816
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:09,200
What's wrong with you?

817
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:09,760
What?

818
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:14,560
I erected lavish, magnificent sets
to dance with my rowdy baby...

819
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:18,040
and you shove your face
into the camera?

820
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:19,280
Buzz off.

821
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:22,440
Maari would kill us if he found out
about this scene and song!

822
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,760
He assigned a job for you.
Will you do it?

823
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:25,640
What job?

824
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,480
You'll get a call tomorrow.

825
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:31,520
All you need to do is deliver the goods
without any hiccups and collect the dough.

826
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:33,880
Who are you?

827
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:36,280
I am Anandi.
We spoke over the phone?

828
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:37,640
What's in the crate?

829
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,240
Gym supplements.

830
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,320
- All safe?
- It's all safe!

831
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:45,640
- Stop.
- Hello, sir!

832
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,000
Okay, go!

833
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,200
Anandi?

834
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:02,760
I'm Anandi.
Tell me.

835
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:04,360
- All okay?
- Yes.

836
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:06,360
Call me if there is a problem.

837
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:08,880
Anandi is sharp as a needle, sir.

838
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:13,160
If Maari asks, tell him great stuff
about me. Okay?

839
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,680
Check this.

840
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,040
It's filled with cocaine.
A lot of it.

841
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:59,720
Just answer my question.
Where is it coming from?

842
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,720
Make it fast!
I'm getting late.

843
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:03,400
- Don't say that again.
- I won't...

844
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:04,920
Isn't that Anandi?

845
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,920
Yes, what is she doing here?

846
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,960
Brother Kalai!
How are you?

847
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:12,240
Maari is not here?

848
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:13,760
Maari is not here...

849
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:14,840
What's this?

850
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:18,040
It's some bodybuilding powder.
I didn't pry for details.

851
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:19,960
Lesser I know,
lesser the trouble.

852
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:22,040
They told me not to open it.

853
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,440
- Who gave you this work?
- Maari did.

854
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:26,440
Maari gave it to you?

855
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:27,960
Why, is there a problem?

856
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,120
Not at all.

857
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:31,680
These goods are ours.
Leave it here, I'll handle it.

858
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,440
Did you inform Maari?
I'll call him?

859
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:37,040
If Brother Kalai says it's fine,
it's fine.

860
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:38,880
- Okay.
- Anandi...

861
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,920
- Where are you delivering these?
- Some warehouse near Red Hills.

862
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:43,840
- Okay!
- See you.

863
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:56,600
Are you calling Maari?

864
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:00,480
Wait! That girl might have lied to us.

865
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:03,520
She doesn't lie
when it comes to Maari.

866
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:05,040
Fine...

867
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:07,000
Let's find out
who the supplier is.

868
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:09,040
Then you can talk to Maari.

869
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:13,640
Keep it safely

870
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,160
Keep it, inside

871
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:16,480
Hey, come this side

872
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:20,240
Stop, you can't go in.

873
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:22,880
- Buzz off.
- Calm down.

874
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:24,320
Let them in.

875
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:30,800
That girl screwed up?

876
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:32,400
What does Maari
have to do with this?

877
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,120
She ratted his name too?

878
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:37,920
I thought she was a sharp girl.
But very bad.

879
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:38,920
Let that be.

880
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:39,960
Who are you?

881
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,200
How do you know Maari?

882
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:42,920
I've only known him for a while now.

883
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:44,440
I'm not from around here.

884
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,920
I came with the consignment
from Kenya.

885
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:52,640
But the Kenyan gang was adamant
about running the business here.

886
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,640
It was Maari who
sorted it out for us.

887
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:58,040
He didn't want you to know,
but that girl screwed up!

888
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:01,120
Maari would never do anything
behind my back.

889
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:04,680
Maari doesn't like drug smugglers
or drug users!

890
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:07,800
You know why he is doing it
behind your back.

891
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:10,920
Maari is a good friend.

892
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,320
He'd never let anything harmful near you.

893
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:16,720
But at the same time,
he is good at what he does.

894
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,160
He'd never pass up
on a great opportunity.

895
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:21,400
You are lying.

896
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:27,600
Why would Anandi do this work
if Maari didn't tell her to?

897
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:33,600
Hope you haven't
taken any packets for yourself!

898
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:35,600
Maari would kill me!

899
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:38,360
How come Singayya doesn't
know about this?

900
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,240
Who said he doesn't?

901
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:43,880
Who do you think attempted
to kill Maari that night?

902
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:52,440
Kalai, if you need anything,
don't hesitate to ask.

903
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,400
You had given Anandi some work,
is she doing okay?

904
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:26,360
It's all good.
You know how Saturday works.

905
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:28,480
But Saturday is an off day.

906
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:30,440
- Isn't that Vallavan?
- Yes, that's him.

907
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:31,320
Maari has come
Go

908
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:32,600
Why is he running away?

909
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,480
Why are they running away from us?

910
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:35,960
Vallavan...

911
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
What are you doing here?

912
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:40,560
- I was just talking to my friend...
- I know all your friends.

913
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:44,320
- What's in that bag?
- Just our stuff...

914
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:45,400
You look nervous.

915
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:46,680
Check the bag.

916
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:51,280
Bro!

917
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:55,880
He knows we don't deal with drugs
and yet he took up this job?

918
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:59,960
Maari, Kalai doesn't need to know.

919
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:01,680
I made a mistake.

920
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:06,920
Don't blow this up.

921
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:08,760
You can take a cut, if you want.

922
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:16,720
Maari, let me go.
Listen to me.

923
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:18,520
Kalai!

924
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:20,960
- See what he's done!
- What happened?

925
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:23,560
He's peddling drugs
behind our backs.

926
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:27,080
He's doing the very business
we wanted to stay away from.

927
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:28,520
Kalai...

928
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:30,200
He's pinning it on me!

929
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,280
- You're crossing a line!
- Maari...

930
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:34,560
Calm down.

931
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:37,000
I went to Maari's house
and found packs of cocaine there.

932
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:38,480
When I questioned them,
they dragged me down here.

933
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:39,520
I will hit you
if you talk lie

934
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:40,920
Kalai, he is the one lying.

935
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:43,000
We caught him red-handed
while he was dealing.

936
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:45,600
You begged us not to tell Kalai
and now you're turning the tables on us?

937
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:48,480
Where would I get the drugs?
Who would trust me with it?

938
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:49,840
Especially, with you around.

939
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:52,520
- Kalai, Maari has betrayed--
- Stop right there.

940
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:53,880
Maari...

941
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:02,240
Is there something
you need to tell me, Maari?

942
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:03,440
What?

943
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:06,160
If you want to say something,
now is the time.

944
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,240
Are you dealing drugs
behind my back?

945
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:15,600
What's this Kalai?
You believe his lies?

946
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:17,560
You take his word over Maari's?

947
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:18,960
I know everything.

948
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:21,120
I got to know yesterday.

949
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:24,720
I even know who your supplier is.

950
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:27,080
Supplier?
What are you blabbering?

951
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:28,880
I asked you myself...

952
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:31,640
if we can peddle drugs.

953
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:34,520
They're lying to you.

954
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:36,200
Why would she lie?

955
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:37,560
Anandi!

956
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,160
Anandi...

957
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:46,960
who gave you that job?

958
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,920
Saturday told me...
that Maari wanted me to do it.

959
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:52,080
I only transported the goods.

960
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:55,240
But I had no idea
what was inside it.

961
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:57,440
He was the one
who came up to me...

962
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:59,120
and said he needs Anandi
for some work.

963
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:01,240
Sure! Blame it all on me.

964
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:04,520
Have you ever seen me
in that job anytime?

965
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:07,800
Kalai and I saw her carrying it
only yesterday.

966
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:09,640
We checked the goods
and found coke in it.

967
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:11,280
Now I get what's going on.

968
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:13,320
She went to Maari
after getting caught yesterday.

969
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:14,800
Now he's pinning it on me.

970
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:16,240
No!

971
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:18,400
I don't know what's going on.

972
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:20,560
- You two...
- Shut up, woman!

973
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:22,640
Yesterday, even I believed
you didn't know what's going on.

974
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:24,280
Now, I have my doubts on you.

975
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:26,720
Maari knows how to use you.

976
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:28,760
Say one more word and you're done for...

977
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:31,480
He's lying through his teeth!
Vallavan...

978
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:33,160
Don't pounce on me now.

979
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:34,840
You've been cheating
your friend all this time...

980
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:37,160
Watch your mouth.
Know who you're talking about?

981
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:51,160
Are you high on coke?

982
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:52,960
Why?

983
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,480
You think I'd dare to hit you
only when I'm high on coke?

984
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:00,120
Hit me.

985
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:01,880
Come on.

986
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:04,760
Why did you stop?

987
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:06,200
Hit me!

988
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:14,000
You're not in any state
to understand a thing I say.

989
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:15,640
It will all appear wrong to you.

990
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:25,200
Lay a hand on Saturday again...

991
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:27,360
and I'll chop that hand off.

992
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:34,840
Maari, is there a problem?

993
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,480
- Wait...
- You!

994
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:39,200
I'm furious.
Just go away now!

995
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:41,000
What did I do?

996
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:43,760
You should have told me
when you sensed something was wrong.

997
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:45,680
I didn't do anything on purpose.

998
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:47,920
Have I ever done anything
to wrong you?

999
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,840
I'm sure it's not her fault.

1000
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,200
- You're supporting her?
- No.

1001
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:53,920
I'm not.

1002
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,800
She came behind me like a silly girl,
and they've used that.

1003
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,320
Tell her to leave.

1004
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:01,280
Is it wrong express affection?

1005
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:02,840
Did I ask for it?

1006
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:05,360
It's your affection
that's landed me in trouble.

1007
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:09,560
What?

1008
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:13,080
There are so many people
longing for affection.

1009
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,520
I consider you the centre
of my universe...

1010
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:18,680
you only think of me as trouble?

1011
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:25,640
You're angry now?
Have you ever thought...

1012
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:27,840
'I've sent her on a dangerous job.'

1013
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:30,560
'Is she safe?
Did she get home?'

1014
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:33,080
Are you not one bit
concerned about me?

1015
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:37,400
Exactly.

1016
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:41,000
I've been caring for you
all this time...

1017
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:43,040
took you to the hospital...

1018
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,880
I pray to the God every single day
for your well being.

1019
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:48,320
And think about you all the time.

1020
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:50,480
But you...?

1021
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:53,200
You don't even consider me
a living thing, do you?

1022
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:57,000
You'll understand my worth
only when I'm gone.

1023
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:09,400
Kalai is not in a state of mind
to listen to anything we say.

1024
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:10,920
He won't understand.

1025
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:12,680
We must handle this on our own.

1026
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:15,320
Vallavan isn't smart enough
to deal with drugs on his own.

1027
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:17,760
I'm sure Singayya is behind this.

1028
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:19,560
Let's get him.

1029
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:23,360
But if I get involved in this directly,
it will blow up into a gang war.

1030
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:26,760
Every man sows the seeds
of his demise somewhere.

1031
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:40,880
Beeja?

1032
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:42,680
Well done!

1033
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:46,720
You turned the thickest of friends
against each other.

1034
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:48,720
This is the right time.

1035
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:50,080
Let's not delay it.

1036
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:52,280
Kill them both tonight.

1037
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:53,960
The time isn't right yet.

1038
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:55,400
We should wait a little.

1039
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:57,200
We shouldn't delay any further!

1040
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:59,160
We should draw first blood.

1041
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:00,760
It was my plan.

1042
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:03,200
I decide when it's time.

1043
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:06,800
Who is he to order me around?

1044
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:09,160
Thinks he is some mastermind?

1045
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:11,760
- Listen...
- Yes?

1046
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:14,640
Find a good hit-man
from outside the city.

1047
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:15,360
Okay.

1048
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:18,880
It will be different this time.

1049
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:21,880
Maari and Kalai must not
live to see tomorrow.

1050
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:23,160
Okay, brother.

1051
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:32,200
- Who did that?
- Calm down!

1052
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:33,760
'If one auto driver faces a crisis...'

1053
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:35,360
'...it holds good for
all drivers as well', he said

1054
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:36,920
Manikkam anna gave this

1055
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:39,960
He asked me to wait till the surgery
is over, in case you needed help

1056
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,600
Bless his generous soul, bro

1057
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:43,960
Who are we to say?
Our entire country echoes this!

1058
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,520
- Where is he?
- Today is 'Ayudha Pooja'

1059
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:51,600
He'll be thanking the Gods now
with a rock and roll song!

1060
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:58,400
Someone is throwing it intentionally.
Find out who it is!

1061
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:03,400
What?

1062
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:16,160
What happened to you?

1063
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:46,880
Maari used the Kenyan to kill our boss
at the cinema.

1064
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:49,400
Gather all our men and arms.
This day, he will--

1065
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:50,600
He will what?

1066
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:56,920
What will you do to him this day?

1067
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:00,440
This is Kalai's turf.

1068
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:04,440
If I ever see any of you
in the hood again...

1069
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:07,480
I will finish you off!

1070
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:21,160
Chase them away.

1071
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:44,240
The entire lot has been
burned down to ashes!

1072
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:47,240
Where were you people?
What the hell were you doing?

1073
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:49,560
I worked so hard
to get that lot.

1074
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:51,320
It's all gone now!

1075
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:56,680
Toss him into the fire.

1076
01:03:57,960 --> 01:03:59,440
Call up Kalai and tell him...

1077
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:03,560
Maari burnt down the warehouse
with Vallavan in it.

1078
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:14,800
Maari killed Vallavan.

1079
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:52,560
Hi, darling

1080
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,640
Why are you still here?

1081
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:02,000
You should get home.

1082
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:03,720
I know my way.

1083
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:06,560
Don't pretend like you care about me.

1084
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:08,600
My affection is a problem to you.

1085
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:11,040
Yes.

1086
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:13,560
Affection is a problem for me...

1087
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:22,080
If only someone had shown me affection
in the past, I'd know how to handle it.

1088
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,040
This is the best I can do.

1089
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:30,400
Are you even listening?

1090
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:31,840
I'm talking to you!

1091
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:38,560
You annoying piece of crap!
Couldn't you find another time?

1092
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:41,960
After all these years,
he finally decides to say something...

1093
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,080
and you choose this time
to attack him?

1094
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:45,480
I wasn't going to say anything!

1095
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:48,160
Oh, dear god!
The moment is gone?

1096
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:51,080
You scum-bag!
See, he's got cold-feet now.

1097
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:53,120
Go home.

1098
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:55,560
Who are you?

1099
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:57,080
Who sent you?

1100
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,360
Go home.

1101
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:22,000
I'll handle this.
Just go!

1102
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:46,440
Turn the lights on.

1103
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:55,400
Let go of me.

1104
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:56,920
Let go!

1105
01:06:57,040 --> 01:06:58,920
I said, let go!

1106
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:29,040
Just give me the guy
who hit her...

1107
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:31,320
and the rest of you
can run away from here.

1108
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:34,040
It was him, Maari.

1109
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:35,720
You're dead!

1110
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:42,200
What are you guys
doing here?

1111
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:45,280
- If Kalai finds out...
- He sent us here to kill you.

1112
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:49,200
Maari must die.

1113
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:51,000
Get him tonight!

1114
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:55,360
Maari...

1115
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:58,360
Let me out!

1116
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:04,520
How many of you have set out
to stab me in the back?

1117
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:13,920
Maari...

1118
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:16,920
Let him go!

1119
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:49,600
Good question.

1120
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:53,640
After all this, it would be a pity
to let someone else kill you.

1121
01:09:56,920 --> 01:09:59,440
You need to die at the
hands of the God of Death.

1122
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:04,160
You need to die knowing
I was behind all of this.

1123
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:09,160
You need to die knowing who I am,
and what you did to my life.

1124
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:16,680
You should go through the same pain
I went through.

1125
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:20,840
Just like I suffered in the prison
with nobody on my side...

1126
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:22,840
you're alone and helpless now.

1127
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:26,920
Even your best friend
wants you dead.

1128
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:28,200
Sad!

1129
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:31,640
There is not one person
who wants you to live.

1130
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:36,040
Even you've lost the desire to live.

1131
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:38,800
You are ready to die.

1132
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:41,600
Maari!

1133
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:51,320
Why?

1134
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:53,880
Maari, they stabbed you?

1135
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:57,600
Come, let's get you to the hospital.

1136
01:10:58,320 --> 01:10:59,560
Maari...

1137
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:02,200
Okay!

1138
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:04,000
Die together.

1139
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:51,160
Drive to the hospital.

1140
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:52,120
Hurry up!

1141
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:53,320
Shit!

1142
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:58,920
Hello?

1143
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:01,240
What is it?

1144
01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:03,200
Is it done yet?

1145
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:05,080
Have you killed Maari?

1146
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:07,120
Hello?

1147
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:09,000
Friend...

1148
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:14,600
Even if all my friends turn traitors...

1149
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:17,840
and all those traitors
become my enemies...

1150
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:19,760
I'll face it all.
I'll survive.

1151
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:21,680
Be well.

1152
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:44,240
You can't afford to be
so low now, Kalai.

1153
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:46,400
There are many people
dependent on you.

1154
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:48,000
It's just you from now.

1155
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:51,840
If you need any help,
I'll be there for you.

1156
01:12:57,680 --> 01:12:58,920
Why have you spared Kalai?

1157
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:01,120
If you get him, you're the top boss.

1158
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:05,200
We need Kalai to run
the business for now.

1159
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:07,600
Once we reach the top,
we'll kick the ladder off.

1160
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:18,560
Ask the SI in Maari's area
to talk to me.

1161
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:21,760
Police investigate murder attempt
over gangster Maari by mysterious group.

1162
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:24,320
Chennai's Collector Vijaya vows to wipe out
crime in the city with the help of police.

1163
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:27,160
Vijaya Chamundeswari takes charge
as the head of Law and Judiciary.

1164
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:29,600
Miss Vijaya promoted as joint secretary
of state for Law and Judiciary.

1165
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:32,080
Joint Secretary Vijaya forms a
special task force...

1166
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:35,680
to prevent unlawful practices
in the upcoming elections.

1167
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:39,520
You'd asked for a background check
on the assembly election candidates.

1168
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:41,800
We've narrowed it down
to 574 candidates.

1169
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:42,920
Criminal records?

1170
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:46,080
More than 80 percent of the candidates
have prior criminal records.

1171
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:47,560
Thank god for the 20 percent!

1172
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:49,960
Ignore the former MLAs and MPs.

1173
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:51,040
46, madam.

1174
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:52,480
First time nominees?

1175
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:53,840
5 members.

1176
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:56,160
Vedharaj from Tindivanam Constituency.

1177
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:57,800
S. Mani from Trichy East.

1178
01:13:57,840 --> 01:13:59,640
Gangadhar Beeja from Thousand Lights.

1179
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:00,880
- From Madurai West...
- One second.

1180
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:02,160
What was that third name?

1181
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:03,920
Gangadhar Beeja from Thousand Lights.

1182
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:06,400
- He is a known gangster...
- Thanatos.

1183
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:11,960
Thanatos is just a myth, madam.
It's a rumour started by someone.

1184
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,440
We had admitted a convict
at the hospital.

1185
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:17,280
He killed a police constable
while getting discharged.

1186
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:19,840
He had a mental disorder
and committed suicide.

1187
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:21,800
Here is the certificate.

1188
01:14:23,240 --> 01:14:24,240
What about Beeja?

1189
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:25,480
He was an ex-convict.

1190
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:28,960
Because of his good conduct,
he was granted an early release.

1191
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:31,960
Since his release, he's involved in
various businesses and social activities.

1192
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:34,760
Now he's contesting as MLA
in the Thousand Lights constituency.

1193
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:36,120
Long Live Beeja!

1194
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:38,320
Hail the mighty Beeja!
Love live!

1195
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:40,560
Hail our Leader Gangadhar Beeja!
Long live.

1196
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:43,640
Hail our Leader Gangadhar Beeja!
Long live.

1197
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:57,680
We nominate Kalai as our party's candidate
in the Thousand Lights Constituency.

1198
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:01,560
Congratulations, Kalai!

1199
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:04,120
Beeja! Get ready.

1200
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:05,680
We have a lot of work to do.

1201
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:07,040
I am ready, Kalai.

1202
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:09,240
I am ready to be the candidate.

1203
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:11,600
They've announced the list of candidates.

1204
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:12,840
I know.

1205
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:14,720
That's why I'm asking you...

1206
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:17,120
I'll run instead of you
in Thousand Lights.

1207
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:18,480
You should withdraw.

1208
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:20,160
Choose your words carefully.

1209
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:23,080
I made you a leader.

1210
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:27,160
I've spared you only because
you were of some use to me.

1211
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:29,800
When I feel like
I have no use for you...

1212
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:32,480
you'll be dead the next second.

1213
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:36,520
I'm trying to be patient,
but you're crossing the line.

1214
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:39,080
Son, forget it.
Come here.

1215
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:39,960
Be quiet!

1216
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:42,760
This is your last warning.

1217
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:46,080
I don't want to cause trouble during election
by killing a fellow party member.

1218
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:47,360
Get him out of here.

1219
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:53,800
Hi, dad.

1220
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:55,640
Hello, Kalai.

1221
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:58,360
I was just asking your wife
when you'd be home!

1222
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:01,360
I want to strike a deal with you.

1223
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:06,920
It was I who killed your brother.

1224
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:10,680
And it was I who
pinned the blame on Maari.

1225
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:16,360
It's such a terrible feeling.

1226
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:20,080
Don't make me do it again.

1227
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:27,720
Beeja, one moment.

1228
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:30,080
Those three big arrests last month...

1229
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:32,680
I found out
how it happened.

1230
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:34,200
Stop the car.

1231
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:37,960
- What's wrong, sir?
- Step outside, man.

1232
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:40,360
Let me go, sir.

1233
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:43,800
Sir, why are you arresting us?
What have we done?

1234
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:46,800
Sir, spare us...
This is gross injustice.

1235
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:58,600
If we have the right information source
and immediate police action...

1236
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:02,680
these arrests are proof that we can arrest
even the biggest criminals.

1237
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:06,240
The new Commissioner has an
informer in one of the gangs.

1238
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:07,880
An informer?

1239
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:10,080
- Is it confirmed?
- I'm sure there is an informer.

1240
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:13,240
But I don't know who he is, which gang,
or how long he's been around.

1241
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:15,200
He could even belong to your gang.

1242
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:17,960
Your job is to find out who he is.

1243
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,200
The Commissioner is being very secretive.

1244
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:22,280
No one else knows except him.

1245
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:25,440
You need to poke and prod and
investigate within your gang.

1246
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:27,720
More importantly,
you need to be very careful.

1247
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:30,480
Two top bosses have already
been locked away.

1248
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:32,560
You could be the next target.

1249
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:39,840
Gangadhar Beeja must not
be allowed to contest in the elections.

1250
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:41,440
He has a hardcore criminal background.

1251
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:42,440
I'm sure you know...

1252
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:45,760
He is an ex-convict who killed the jailers
and escaped 10 years back.

1253
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:46,840
Take a look.

1254
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:48,440
Even in this case...

1255
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:50,080
it was Beeja
who committed these murders.

1256
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:52,680
Thanatos and Beeja
are both the same person.

1257
01:17:52,720 --> 01:17:54,120
Are there any witnesses?

1258
01:17:57,440 --> 01:17:59,480
There was a witness.
But not anymore.

1259
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:01,040
I don't know where he is.

1260
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:03,800
I heard you have an informer
in one of the gangs.

1261
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:06,400
If you will it, we can
definitely use that informer...

1262
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:09,240
to collect evidence against Beeja
and mount a case.

1263
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:10,920
Please take your seat.

1264
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:15,080
The safety of my informer
is the most important thing.

1265
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:16,720
Because this is a dangerous job.

1266
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:19,160
Beeja is real sharp.

1267
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:21,640
Try through some other source.

1268
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:23,960
Find some solid criminal evidence.

1269
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:27,360
Come to me then.
I can give you that support.

1270
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:35,600
These days, if you want to do good,
you need to be a bad person.

1271
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:37,200
Maari has been missing
for 8 years now.

1272
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:39,320
So many people tried
finding him for various cases.

1273
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:41,760
Neither the cops nor the gangs
could find him.

1274
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:44,640
Beeja is trying to hunt him down, too.
He's had no luck either.

1275
01:18:47,720 --> 01:18:49,960
I have never missed my mark.

1276
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,600
This was the first time.

1277
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:56,400
I need to set things right.

1278
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:58,320
We've given up looking for him.

1279
01:18:58,440 --> 01:19:01,240
I don't know if he is even alive, madam.

1280
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:03,880
No one has seen Maari
in several years.

1281
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:06,960
Beeja attempted to kill Maari
eight years back.

1282
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:09,720
He killed four others in that spot.

1283
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:11,480
Maari is the only witness for that.

1284
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:13,400
Re-open this case.

1285
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:16,240
If you find any sort of information,
report directly to me.

1286
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:18,200
We need to find Maari.
Somehow.

1287
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:21,840
There was a girl who kept
running behind Maari...?

1288
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:23,440
- What's her name?
- Anandi, madam.

1289
01:19:23,480 --> 01:19:25,760
We don't know where she is, either.

1290
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:27,040
Can I get a photo of her?

1291
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:29,400
Circulate these photos
of Maari and that girl.

1292
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:33,240
Media, social media, channels,
posters, police stations...

1293
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:34,720
Put them up everywhere.

1294
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,760
We've circulated those photos
all over the state.

1295
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:43,160
No information.

1296
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:44,800
There can be only one explanation.

1297
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:46,360
Maari is dead.

1298
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:53,360
- Hello?
- I heard you're doing my work!

1299
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:54,520
What?

1300
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:57,680
You don't even need to inform me
if you find Maari...

1301
01:19:57,720 --> 01:19:58,840
I'll get to know anyway.

1302
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:01,560
I've got ears everywhere.

1303
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:04,280
I'll take good care of you
after I become an MLA.

1304
01:20:05,080 --> 01:20:06,960
Think before you act.

1305
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:10,200
Else, I'll have to take
care of you right away!

1306
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:16,240
Why did you come by auto?
I'd have sent you the car.

1307
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:17,960
That's okay!

1308
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:21,800
The auto driver wants to meet you.
He says it's something important.

1309
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:23,960
Everyone says that.
Don't encourage such people!

1310
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:27,560
Just go talk to him!
He said his name is Maariappan.

1311
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:48,480
I came here to tell you
to stop looking for me.

1312
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:53,280
Please take down my photos
and my Anandi's photos.

1313
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:55,640
I'm requesting you.

1314
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:59,520
I knew this would be the first thing
you'd say when I find you.

1315
01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:01,800
But I thought it would
come as a threat.

1316
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,240
I didn't expect it to come as a request.

1317
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:11,920
Maari...

1318
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:18,400
She survived.

1319
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:21,120
But because the bullet
hit her spinal cord...

1320
01:21:21,160 --> 01:21:22,800
her legs have been paralysed.

1321
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:25,040
So she can never walk again.

1322
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:34,520
Maari?

1323
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:37,560
It was my price to pay for all my sins.

1324
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:40,600
Why did you get in the way?

1325
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:42,000
Fool!

1326
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:44,120
Is it a sin to protect a girl?

1327
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:48,800
I have committed many sins...

1328
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:53,720
For the first time,
I wanted to do the right thing.

1329
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:55,840
But now...

1330
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:04,560
The girl you saved
was my older sister.

1331
01:22:12,440 --> 01:22:15,400
Before you knew the reason
why I loved you...

1332
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:17,360
I wanted you to
fall in love with me.

1333
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:20,120
But that didn't happen.

1334
01:22:20,360 --> 01:22:21,800
Look at us now.

1335
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:26,920
Let's go some place
no one can find us.

1336
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:30,120
I don't have a friend here...

1337
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:31,560
nor a life.

1338
01:22:34,720 --> 01:22:36,240
From now, you're my everything.

1339
01:22:39,320 --> 01:22:40,800
Only you.

1340
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:43,680
They say bad things lead to good things...

1341
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:46,320
Looks like it's true, after all.

1342
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:48,800
So what if I've lost my legs?

1343
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,320
I've got you.

1344
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:56,760
She gave me her whole life.

1345
01:22:57,280 --> 01:23:00,520
So I decided to
change my life for her.

1346
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:07,880
I took her as far away
from my world as I could.

1347
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:17,840
I'd never really believed in
relationships or family ties...

1348
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:20,040
But Anandi changed all that.

1349
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:39,280
Anandi, Saturday, Punch-Bag, and I...

1350
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:40,880
they were my family.

1351
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:42,320
My world.

1352
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:43,920
Halt!

1353
01:23:44,160 --> 01:23:45,640
- Ma'am?
- Yes?

1354
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:47,920
I heard you have
a house to rent.

1355
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,160
Oh yes! They said you'd be coming.

1356
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:54,120
Lakshmi, take them upstairs
and show them the house.

1357
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:56,480
I tell you not to eat biriyani everyday!

1358
01:23:56,520 --> 01:23:57,400
You're getting heavier!

1359
01:23:57,440 --> 01:23:58,680
Keep quiet and lift me!

1360
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:00,360
Is the ground floor included?

1361
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:02,200
- Where would we go, then?
- Go to hell.

1362
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:04,360
Shut your trap!

1363
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:07,400
The house is in the first floor.
Is that okay?

1364
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:08,800
Is there an elevator?

1365
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:10,960
- What's that?
- An elevator...

1366
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:12,960
We don't have all that.

1367
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,880
That's not a problem.
He can carry me up and down.

1368
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:19,040
You look like good people.

1369
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:21,360
He is mocking us.

1370
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:25,040
You're putting on a performance?

1371
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:27,880
- You can move in tomorrow.
- Okay!

1372
01:24:29,480 --> 01:24:30,760
Hold on!

1373
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:34,760
'Open the door, you old ghost!'

1374
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:37,720
Oh, no.

1375
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:40,240
I think Grandma Dora and Grandpa Boots
have gone missing.

1376
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:42,920
I already told you,
your performance wasn't working...

1377
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:45,080
What is that song you were singing?

1378
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:47,160
It's from a horror movie.

1379
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:50,800
We've shifted upstairs.
You can take the ground floor.

1380
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:52,480
You don't need an elevator now, do you?

1381
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:54,560
We don't want to impose...

1382
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:57,680
Not at all.
You can still carry your wife around.

1383
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:32,600
Boy!

1384
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:35,840
I'm talking to you.
Bring those water cans up here.

1385
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:42,600
From this distance, doesn't it
look like Maari is doing some chores?

1386
01:25:42,680 --> 01:25:44,800
He is doing chores!
Hurry up.

1387
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:48,040
Maari, you're being useful?
The world will come to an end!

1388
01:25:48,120 --> 01:25:49,320
It's fine.

1389
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:51,480
He says it's fine.
Let him do it.

1390
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:55,280
You do it, moron.

1391
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:56,360
That was funny.

1392
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:57,880
Why is he throwing like this?

1393
01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:05,720
Don't keep hanging around at home
like a bunch of idiots.

1394
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:11,160
Go for a night show movie
and come back in the morning.

1395
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:12,880
Morning?
What's all this?

1396
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:16,040
Friendship comes first
to Maari, Grandpa Boots.

1397
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:17,280
Everything else comes last.

1398
01:26:17,320 --> 01:26:18,840
They don't know us.
Let them be.

1399
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:19,560
What?

1400
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:21,040
- Here, take this.
- What's that?

1401
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:23,280
Bus tickets to Madurai.
Come back next week.

1402
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:24,440
Okay, we'll take our time.

1403
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:26,400
Or we could just move back
to Madras permanently.

1404
01:26:26,440 --> 01:26:27,560
Let's go.

1405
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:30,800
I don't know whether to laugh or cry.

1406
01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:32,600
Why so emotional?

1407
01:26:32,680 --> 01:26:33,800
I'm 28 years old.

1408
01:26:33,880 --> 01:26:35,680
Should I feel bad
that I'm still unmarried?

1409
01:26:35,720 --> 01:26:36,680
Don't feel bad.

1410
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:39,240
Or should I feel happy that
this guy is unmarried at 40?

1411
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:41,320
- You're getting too cocky.
- Let's go.

1412
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:42,680
Come back here.

1413
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:53,120
What are you looking for?

1414
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:55,080
You were looking for
something on the floor...?

1415
01:26:55,120 --> 01:26:56,080
Oh, that...

1416
01:26:56,240 --> 01:26:57,920
it was 'shy'.

1417
01:26:57,960 --> 01:27:00,480
It doesn't suit you! Don't bother.

1418
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:07,840
- You're going to sing?
- Let's be man and wife.

1419
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:09,400
We're already married.

1420
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:11,200
You're useless!

1421
01:27:11,240 --> 01:27:12,040
Why?

1422
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:13,760
Sit down.

1423
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:15,880
You bossing me around.

1424
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:29,520
Don't act like a drunk hobo
leaning against a lamp post!

1425
01:27:29,560 --> 01:27:31,280
That's the best I can do.

1426
01:27:31,320 --> 01:27:32,560
Fine, don't get mad.

1427
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:35,000
What do you like about me?

1428
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:39,760
Why do you need to think so hard?

1429
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:43,240
- Is there nothing at all?
- Wait, I'm thinking!

1430
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:45,680
Yes... your smile!

1431
01:27:46,280 --> 01:27:48,400
- Like the way you're smiling now...
- Really?

1432
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:50,600
Bright as a Petromax lamp.

1433
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:52,480
I have checked you out, too.

1434
01:27:52,520 --> 01:27:54,160
Petromax lamp?

1435
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:55,920
Is that all?

1436
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:57,960
You're the light of my life!

1437
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,120
It took you all these years
to realise that?

1438
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:01,680
That...

1439
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:04,160
You were saying it out loud.

1440
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:06,520
And I just didn't say it.

1441
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:08,000
But it was there all along.

1442
01:28:08,040 --> 01:28:09,560
You're just lying!

1443
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:11,160
You could have told me.

1444
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:18,640
My life could have ended any minute...

1445
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:21,000
I don't want you widowed and wailing.

1446
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:22,720
Shut up!

1447
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:25,400
Is that how you speak
on such a special day?

1448
01:28:30,240 --> 01:28:32,600
But you wouldn't let my life end.

1449
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:38,720
Your life is mine.

1450
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:40,600
How could I let it end?

1451
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:45,760
"Tell me, would there be green;
If heavens didn't burst into rain?"

1452
01:29:46,360 --> 01:29:52,720
"Tell me, wouldn't flowers bloom in vain;
If you didn't wear them in your mane?"

1453
01:29:52,760 --> 01:29:59,800
"My love, I'll always have your back;
Wrap you around me like exquisite silk."

1454
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:08,600
"My love, I've turned over a brand new leaf;
Even learning to be a little lovey-dovey."

1455
01:30:09,240 --> 01:30:15,800
"Come on, walk with your swag;
My Warrior!"

1456
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:22,560
"Let's jaunt the world in my auto;
My Saviour!"

1457
01:30:52,200 --> 01:30:59,200
"Our bed creaks a sweet melody;
I slip into the most tranquil dream."

1458
01:30:59,240 --> 01:31:06,160
"You brought me calm and composure;
My Quest has attained closure."

1459
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:13,320
"I will bear you in my bosom always;
Everyday, I bolt across the blue skies."

1460
01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:21,440
"The world seems to revolve around me;
My eyes rest as peace engulfs me."

1461
01:31:22,160 --> 01:31:29,080
"You're the fairy flown down,
To fix my faulty fate."

1462
01:31:29,160 --> 01:31:35,600
"I've been re-born now,
How could I thank you enough?"

1463
01:31:35,680 --> 01:31:42,720
"Princess, you melt this stone heart of mine;
It's you and me till the end of time."

1464
01:31:42,760 --> 01:31:49,320
"Tell me, would there be green;
If heavens didn't burst into rain?"

1465
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:56,160
"Tell me, wouldn't flowers bloom in vain;
If you didn't wear them in your mane?"

1466
01:31:56,200 --> 01:32:03,240
"Handsome, you are my lion;
An unpolished chunk of gold."

1467
01:32:03,320 --> 01:32:12,240
"What did you see in this ruffian?
You're stuck with me forever now."

1468
01:32:39,160 --> 01:32:41,320
Are you really happy?

1469
01:32:42,440 --> 01:32:43,640
What more could I ask for?

1470
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:45,760
I've got my deer cub on my arms.

1471
01:32:46,040 --> 01:32:47,600
And my lion cub in your tummy.

1472
01:32:47,640 --> 01:32:48,640
What more could I want?

1473
01:32:48,680 --> 01:32:49,960
What if it's a girl?

1474
01:32:50,480 --> 01:32:54,080
Girl or boy, Maari's kid is a lion cub!

1475
01:32:57,760 --> 01:33:01,320
This is the sort of life
I always wished for.

1476
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:03,080
So I'm really happy!

1477
01:33:04,680 --> 01:33:06,240
But that's not the case with you.

1478
01:33:06,760 --> 01:33:08,760
You were a proud rowdy...

1479
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:11,000
now you've left it all behind.

1480
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:13,360
I really miss that old Maari.

1481
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:16,360
What are you saying?
I should go back to my old ways?

1482
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:18,440
Be whatever you want to be.

1483
01:33:18,920 --> 01:33:20,240
Just one thing...

1484
01:33:20,760 --> 01:33:24,280
Never hurt someone for your happiness.

1485
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:26,040
But...

1486
01:33:26,280 --> 01:33:30,120
Never let someone's mistake
take away your happiness.

1487
01:33:33,640 --> 01:33:37,560
I indulge in random
philosophy only when I'm drunk.

1488
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:40,440
But you do that even when you're sober?

1489
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:42,560
They say it's normal
when I'm carrying a baby.

1490
01:33:42,640 --> 01:33:44,920
Don't blame my child for
the crap you're saying.

1491
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:46,360
What is it?

1492
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:47,440
- Maari...
- Yes?

1493
01:33:47,480 --> 01:33:48,640
The baby is coming.

1494
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:23,800
Yes?

1495
01:34:24,080 --> 01:34:26,320
You had a baby boy. He is healthy.

1496
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:30,200
But her legs were paralysed
so there was a complication...

1497
01:34:30,240 --> 01:34:30,960
Stop!

1498
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:31,880
What happened?

1499
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:34,280
We tried.

1500
01:34:34,360 --> 01:34:36,440
But we couldn't save her.

1501
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:41,840
What do you mean?

1502
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:43,680
Sorry.

1503
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:19,440
This is why I wanted
to be on my own all along.

1504
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:23,480
She chased after me and...

1505
01:35:24,120 --> 01:35:25,560
what was the point?

1506
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:31,120
I showered all my love on one girl...

1507
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:35,280
and now she just left?

1508
01:35:39,120 --> 01:35:40,960
I won't even see her face.

1509
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:52,200
Try to wake her up.

1510
01:35:52,520 --> 01:35:55,840
She looks like she is asleep.
We should try waking her up.

1511
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:04,200
I feel like my heart might shatter.

1512
01:36:06,440 --> 01:36:08,080
My eyes are watering...

1513
01:36:10,280 --> 01:36:12,360
Without you, Maari is a lifeless corpse.

1514
01:36:26,240 --> 01:36:27,400
Your life is mine.

1515
01:36:27,440 --> 01:36:29,280
How could I let it end?

1516
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:01,400
God bless her soul.

1517
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:04,480
She handed my future to me...

1518
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:06,800
made my life beautiful...

1519
01:37:07,360 --> 01:37:08,960
and took my death with her.

1520
01:37:09,680 --> 01:37:10,800
I'm sorry.

1521
01:37:11,120 --> 01:37:13,080
I didn't know about Anandi's death.

1522
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:16,560
I thought if I search for her,
I might find you.

1523
01:37:18,120 --> 01:37:21,920
I wouldn't mind you searching for me,
nor Beeja finding my whereabouts.

1524
01:37:22,840 --> 01:37:24,240
But I'm not alone now.

1525
01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:25,840
So you have a son now?

1526
01:37:27,120 --> 01:37:28,080
His name?

1527
01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:29,320
Kaali.

1528
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:47,600
I've been trying since morning.

1529
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:54,720
What is it, baby? What is it?

1530
01:37:56,240 --> 01:37:57,600
I did the same thing!

1531
01:37:57,840 --> 01:37:59,520
The granny is singing merrily.

1532
01:37:59,560 --> 01:38:00,960
She is a professional.

1533
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:13,400
So Maari is a family man!

1534
01:38:13,680 --> 01:38:15,240
I swear I can't believe it.

1535
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:18,480
Sometimes I can't believe it myself.

1536
01:38:19,120 --> 01:38:21,520
Is Kaali like his mother or his father?

1537
01:38:23,760 --> 01:38:25,000
He is something else!

1538
01:38:25,040 --> 01:38:27,160
It happened 8 days back, they say.

1539
01:38:27,240 --> 01:38:29,720
He isn't even old enough
to wear full trousers!

1540
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:32,600
He was messing around
with 5th grade kids, that's fine.

1541
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:34,280
Today, he's gone to a whole new level.

1542
01:38:48,160 --> 01:38:50,080
He is such a mischievous kid.

1543
01:38:50,120 --> 01:38:52,600
He troubles others just for fun.

1544
01:38:52,640 --> 01:38:53,800
Come here.

1545
01:38:57,400 --> 01:38:58,720
You brat!

1546
01:39:00,080 --> 01:39:02,360
You fainted before I hit you?

1547
01:39:02,440 --> 01:39:04,200
Give me back my cane!

1548
01:39:07,640 --> 01:39:10,240
It's time for class. Let's go.

1549
01:39:11,960 --> 01:39:12,800
What?

1550
01:39:15,800 --> 01:39:19,160
Mr. Maariappan,
you look like a calm person.

1551
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:23,880
You should teach him to tell good from bad.

1552
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:25,240
You know the Bhagavat Gita?

1553
01:39:25,280 --> 01:39:26,160
I know.

1554
01:39:26,200 --> 01:39:29,520
It's the fat book they make us
take the oath upon at courts?

1555
01:39:29,560 --> 01:39:33,560
You should spend some time with him,
and explain things to him.

1556
01:39:34,120 --> 01:39:35,640
- Okay.
- See you.

1557
01:39:39,200 --> 01:39:39,880
Kaali...

1558
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:42,200
Do you get angry all the time
like your Principal says?

1559
01:39:42,240 --> 01:39:43,400
Not all the time.

1560
01:39:44,600 --> 01:39:47,480
Sometimes I get angry,
sometimes I get confused.

1561
01:39:48,120 --> 01:39:51,280
I'll tell you something simple
that your mother once told me.

1562
01:39:51,480 --> 01:39:54,920
Never hurt someone for your happiness.

1563
01:39:55,240 --> 01:39:56,560
But...

1564
01:39:56,600 --> 01:39:59,520
Never let someone's mistake
take away your happiness.

1565
01:39:59,560 --> 01:40:00,560
Okay?

1566
01:40:00,600 --> 01:40:01,280
Got it!

1567
01:40:01,320 --> 01:40:03,120
It's that simple. Come on.

1568
01:40:20,440 --> 01:40:21,520
- Dad?
- Yes?

1569
01:40:21,560 --> 01:40:25,080
Can I go for the state level
running selections next week?

1570
01:40:25,120 --> 01:40:26,200
Superb, go ahead.

1571
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:28,320
But it's happening in Chennai.

1572
01:40:28,440 --> 01:40:29,000
In Chennai?

1573
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:31,640
I had to come to Chennai
even though I didn't want to.

1574
01:40:31,680 --> 01:40:34,560
It's a big surprise to see you
as a family man.

1575
01:40:34,920 --> 01:40:37,000
But you're also being
a responsible father.

1576
01:40:37,320 --> 01:40:38,280
I'm really happy.

1577
01:40:39,360 --> 01:40:41,360
Let us be happy, too.

1578
01:40:42,040 --> 01:40:45,240
My priority is to ensure that this tiny
haven of mine doesn't get ruined.

1579
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:47,880
I can't come to testify at the court.

1580
01:40:47,920 --> 01:40:50,520
Beeja or Kalai can't know
about my whereabouts.

1581
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:52,920
You didn't have good people
in your life all this time.

1582
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:54,120
But things have changed now.

1583
01:40:54,160 --> 01:40:55,160
You have a son.

1584
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:57,680
Do you want your son
to grow in a good society...

1585
01:40:57,720 --> 01:41:00,040
or in a society where bad people
like Beeja are in power?

1586
01:41:00,080 --> 01:41:01,800
That lies entirely in your hands.

1587
01:41:02,360 --> 01:41:03,480
It's not in my hands.

1588
01:41:03,640 --> 01:41:06,560
Raising my son to be a good person
is the only thing in my control.

1589
01:41:06,600 --> 01:41:08,560
Please let me do that properly.

1590
01:41:09,200 --> 01:41:10,360
I hope you understand.

1591
01:41:19,280 --> 01:41:20,840
Go with him.

1592
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:22,960
You must run perfectly!

1593
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:40,760
Come on, Kaali!

1594
01:41:42,440 --> 01:41:44,480
Come on, go for it!

1595
01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:45,440
Run like the wind.

1596
01:41:45,480 --> 01:41:47,640
That's my boy! Go for it.

1597
01:41:52,200 --> 01:41:53,800
Come on, Kaali!

1598
01:41:56,160 --> 01:41:57,240
Attaboy!

1599
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:00,640
That is my student!

1600
01:42:06,040 --> 01:42:07,680
- I've trained him well.
- What?

1601
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:10,000
- Get us something to eat.
- Okay.

1602
01:42:10,360 --> 01:42:12,040
They'll call for me in 5 minutes.

1603
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:14,120
There's a final selection round.

1604
01:42:14,160 --> 01:42:15,520
We can go home after that?

1605
01:42:15,680 --> 01:42:17,240
- I don't know.
- Drink up!

1606
01:42:21,040 --> 01:42:22,760
What will you accomplish running this race?

1607
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:24,520
Surprise, surprise!

1608
01:42:31,200 --> 01:42:32,120
Maari...

1609
01:42:32,760 --> 01:42:34,720
It's been so many years
since I saw last you!

1610
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:37,240
You've changed.

1611
01:42:40,440 --> 01:42:42,000
Why do you look shocked?

1612
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:45,440
This is Kaali?

1613
01:42:46,640 --> 01:42:48,920
He has a cool name, just like his father.

1614
01:42:50,040 --> 01:42:51,880
Hi, Kaali. My name is Beeja.

1615
01:42:52,400 --> 01:42:53,280
Hi, uncle.

1616
01:42:53,320 --> 01:42:55,000
I'm an old friend of your father's.

1617
01:42:55,320 --> 01:42:57,320
Kaali, the next round is yours?

1618
01:42:57,760 --> 01:42:59,040
Go on, get some practice.

1619
01:42:59,160 --> 01:43:02,040
Wait, Maari.
Let Kaali join the conversation.

1620
01:43:03,080 --> 01:43:04,880
How long have you known my father?

1621
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:06,840
I knew him well when he lived in Chennai.

1622
01:43:07,160 --> 01:43:09,200
We had a lot of give and take.

1623
01:43:10,320 --> 01:43:12,480
I missed your dad for 8 long years.

1624
01:43:13,080 --> 01:43:14,960
I'm glad I caught him here.

1625
01:43:16,040 --> 01:43:19,480
We had a disagreement about something.

1626
01:43:20,640 --> 01:43:22,320
I've come to set it straight.

1627
01:43:22,360 --> 01:43:24,040
You need to give the verdict.

1628
01:43:24,680 --> 01:43:27,920
Do you watch Discovery Channel?

1629
01:43:28,240 --> 01:43:30,680
Have you seen a tiger hunt down a deer?

1630
01:43:30,720 --> 01:43:32,240
Yes, I've seen that!

1631
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:36,520
Now, instead of the
deer running for its life...

1632
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:39,960
imagine how it would look
if the tiger ran for its life?

1633
01:43:40,240 --> 01:43:41,520
That would look bad.

1634
01:43:41,600 --> 01:43:44,360
Heard that, Maari? Your son agrees with me.

1635
01:43:45,280 --> 01:43:46,920
If a tiger doesn't roar...

1636
01:43:47,240 --> 01:43:48,800
it's no tiger.

1637
01:43:50,640 --> 01:43:53,280
But uncle, I've read about tigers.

1638
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:57,520
We think the tiger roars
before it attacks someone.

1639
01:43:57,920 --> 01:44:01,320
A tiger doesn't roar before
it strikes another animal.

1640
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:02,440
Which is why...

1641
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:05,800
No one knows when and
how a tiger is about to strike!

1642
01:44:05,960 --> 01:44:07,320
But when the tiger strikes the target...

1643
01:44:07,400 --> 01:44:09,320
One SMACK! and ZAP! It's finished.

1644
01:44:15,880 --> 01:44:19,080
If you just let things be in their
rightful place, it's best for everyone.

1645
01:44:19,120 --> 01:44:20,440
What say?

1646
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:23,560
No, Maari.

1647
01:44:24,360 --> 01:44:27,400
It's one thing for a tiger
to be quiet normally...

1648
01:44:28,480 --> 01:44:32,520
But say, a man shoots down
something that the tiger really loves...

1649
01:44:34,680 --> 01:44:36,360
and say, it dies...

1650
01:44:37,280 --> 01:44:41,240
if the tiger still quietly
hides in the forest...

1651
01:44:41,280 --> 01:44:42,840
that's not right.

1652
01:44:48,080 --> 01:44:48,960
Boy...

1653
01:44:49,200 --> 01:44:51,040
- Get some practice now.
- Okay, dad.

1654
01:44:55,240 --> 01:44:56,560
What do you want?

1655
01:44:59,280 --> 01:45:02,320
In all this time we were talking here...

1656
01:45:02,600 --> 01:45:05,120
I could have killed you
both several times.

1657
01:45:05,160 --> 01:45:06,920
You know why I haven't done it yet?

1658
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:13,440
Watching you in this state, with that thing
on your forehead and timid as a mouse...

1659
01:45:14,080 --> 01:45:17,080
-is more gratifying than
watching you dead.

1660
01:45:20,640 --> 01:45:23,200
I'm giving you one last chance.

1661
01:45:26,680 --> 01:45:30,040
Kill me if you can, in front of your son.

1662
01:45:30,320 --> 01:45:31,960
But this is your last chance.

1663
01:45:32,680 --> 01:45:34,320
I'm going to count to five.

1664
01:45:35,400 --> 01:45:36,960
In front of your boy...

1665
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:39,120
and all these people...

1666
01:45:39,400 --> 01:45:41,320
kill me if you can!

1667
01:45:43,400 --> 01:45:44,440
One...

1668
01:45:46,600 --> 01:45:47,520
Two...

1669
01:45:50,120 --> 01:45:51,080
Three...

1670
01:45:53,840 --> 01:45:54,760
Four...

1671
01:45:57,160 --> 01:45:58,280
Five!

1672
01:45:59,640 --> 01:46:01,920
Starting now, you're going to spend
every waking moment in fear...

1673
01:46:01,960 --> 01:46:05,200
wondering how and when
I'm going to attack you.

1674
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:07,920
I want you to die of constant fear.

1675
01:46:08,280 --> 01:46:10,360
But I won't take too long.

1676
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:14,400
You and your son will die gruesome deaths.

1677
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:21,760
Don't do anything till
the elections are over.

1678
01:46:22,040 --> 01:46:25,160
Yes, the Commissioner and the
Joint Secretary have already marked you.

1679
01:46:25,240 --> 01:46:26,720
- Watch out.
- I know.

1680
01:46:27,080 --> 01:46:29,760
Till the elections, let him and
his son die of fear every day.

1681
01:46:30,600 --> 01:46:33,520
After the elections,
I'll give him a royal farewell!

1682
01:46:53,360 --> 01:46:55,760
Dad, what are you looking for?

1683
01:46:58,240 --> 01:46:59,320
What took you so long?

1684
01:46:59,360 --> 01:47:01,360
The teacher didn't let us go.

1685
01:47:01,800 --> 01:47:04,480
Don't be playing after school.
Come home directly.

1686
01:47:09,680 --> 01:47:10,560
Good work.

1687
01:47:10,960 --> 01:47:12,360
We'll see tomorrow.

1688
01:47:14,360 --> 01:47:16,120
Sir, do you have a minute?

1689
01:47:16,360 --> 01:47:17,360
Yes, please.

1690
01:47:24,040 --> 01:47:26,880
We have strong evidence against
Beeja in the drug smuggling case.

1691
01:47:26,920 --> 01:47:30,520
We've fast-tracked the case in court,
and there is a hearing day after tomorrow.

1692
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:32,320
We'll send the summon today.

1693
01:47:32,360 --> 01:47:35,680
His party members might
create a problem in court.

1694
01:47:35,800 --> 01:47:38,080
- Strengthen the security.
- Okay, madam.

1695
01:47:38,120 --> 01:47:39,840
Who is the witness?

1696
01:47:39,880 --> 01:47:41,680
That's confidential.

1697
01:47:42,880 --> 01:47:43,920
Who is it?

1698
01:47:44,360 --> 01:47:47,080
Sir, she hasn't even told you.
How would I know?

1699
01:47:47,560 --> 01:47:49,960
Just like how the Commissioner
has an informer in their gang...

1700
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,440
I hear they have an informer
in the police department, too.

1701
01:47:52,480 --> 01:47:54,880
- Really, sir?
- Why do you ask me?

1702
01:47:54,920 --> 01:47:57,360
Investigate it, sir.
You have all the resources.

1703
01:47:57,440 --> 01:47:59,080
Okay, madam. I will try!

1704
01:48:01,240 --> 01:48:02,440
Carry these.

1705
01:48:03,920 --> 01:48:06,160
This new teacher is so hot.

1706
01:48:06,920 --> 01:48:08,560
You heard that?

1707
01:48:09,040 --> 01:48:11,120
Your parents raised you to talk that way?

1708
01:48:11,280 --> 01:48:14,120
They will be very pleased to hear
that kind of language from you.

1709
01:48:14,160 --> 01:48:15,160
Idiots!

1710
01:48:15,200 --> 01:48:17,280
She looks good even when she is angry!

1711
01:48:32,960 --> 01:48:34,000
Stop!

1712
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:38,080
You complained to the Principal?
My father is the Councillor.

1713
01:48:38,120 --> 01:48:40,760
- Not here, let's take it outside.
- Let's go there.

1714
01:48:41,320 --> 01:48:42,480
Grab him!

1715
01:49:26,480 --> 01:49:29,360
- Drop that stick!
- You want to hit me?

1716
01:49:29,400 --> 01:49:31,680
- I dare you to touch me.
- Go away.

1717
01:49:31,760 --> 01:49:32,800
Get up and leave.

1718
01:49:33,160 --> 01:49:34,840
You think I'm just a kid?

1719
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:36,680
I'll rip you apart!

1720
01:49:37,440 --> 01:49:38,520
Get going.

1721
01:49:39,720 --> 01:49:42,240
You little devil!

1722
01:49:43,080 --> 01:49:44,800
They came to hit me, dad.

1723
01:49:45,480 --> 01:49:48,440
You could have left it at that.
Why did you go to the Principal?

1724
01:49:48,680 --> 01:49:50,160
Remember what Mother said?

1725
01:49:50,240 --> 01:49:52,600
Never hurt someone for your happiness.

1726
01:49:52,640 --> 01:49:55,760
Never let someone's mistake
take away your happiness.

1727
01:49:56,120 --> 01:49:57,720
Both of these things happened there.

1728
01:49:57,760 --> 01:49:59,840
I was the only person
who could have stopped it.

1729
01:49:59,880 --> 01:50:04,240
When I see somebody hurting another person,
I should make it stop, right?

1730
01:50:04,440 --> 01:50:07,120
Or they will go on and hurt someone else.

1731
01:50:10,960 --> 01:50:12,240
Sorry, dad.

1732
01:50:19,120 --> 01:50:21,440
Why is your face covered in bruises, son?

1733
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:23,200
Your classmate hit you?

1734
01:50:23,240 --> 01:50:24,560
No, dad. A 5th grade kid hit me.

1735
01:50:24,600 --> 01:50:26,440
A 5th grader?

1736
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:29,280
You got beaten up by a little kid?

1737
01:50:29,640 --> 01:50:31,000
Drag that boy down here!

1738
01:50:31,040 --> 01:50:32,280
- Go.
- Okay.

1739
01:50:33,320 --> 01:50:35,560
The Councillor has sent for us.

1740
01:50:35,680 --> 01:50:36,920
What do we do now?

1741
01:50:41,640 --> 01:50:42,840
I'll talk to him.

1742
01:50:44,920 --> 01:50:46,960
They've filed a case against you.

1743
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:47,760
Who?

1744
01:50:47,800 --> 01:50:49,280
Joint Secretary, Vijaya.

1745
01:50:49,480 --> 01:50:51,080
They've sent you a summon.

1746
01:50:51,560 --> 01:50:54,640
Not just that, she's got a
witness to testify against you.

1747
01:50:55,360 --> 01:50:58,080
They say it's the informer in your gang.

1748
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,920
Everyone seems to know who
the informer is, except you!

1749
01:51:04,040 --> 01:51:04,960
Find him.

1750
01:51:05,800 --> 01:51:07,000
Find him now.

1751
01:51:07,360 --> 01:51:09,480
I'll find him.

1752
01:51:09,800 --> 01:51:10,960
Get Kalai.

1753
01:51:11,400 --> 01:51:12,800
I need to talk to him.

1754
01:51:16,280 --> 01:51:19,360
I need accurate numbers.
Or I'll thrash you!

1755
01:51:19,400 --> 01:51:21,840
- It's all here.
- That's better.

1756
01:51:23,680 --> 01:51:25,160
- This is the guy?
- Greetings.

1757
01:51:26,280 --> 01:51:27,640
Your son hasn't come?

1758
01:51:28,600 --> 01:51:29,600
No, sir.

1759
01:51:30,920 --> 01:51:34,080
Your son has beaten up my son so badly.

1760
01:51:35,160 --> 01:51:37,560
Sir, I spoke to my son...

1761
01:51:38,120 --> 01:51:39,800
It was your son's fault.

1762
01:51:40,640 --> 01:51:42,000
They're just school kids.

1763
01:51:42,320 --> 01:51:45,120
Let's not sow ideas of revenge
in their heads now.

1764
01:51:46,680 --> 01:51:49,240
If you are still angry with my son...

1765
01:51:49,280 --> 01:51:50,760
I apologize on his behalf.

1766
01:51:50,800 --> 01:51:52,080
You're an important person.

1767
01:51:52,120 --> 01:51:54,720
Please be gracious.

1768
01:52:05,160 --> 01:52:08,240
You're waiting to finish
me off, aren't you?

1769
01:52:08,840 --> 01:52:10,480
If I were a single man...

1770
01:52:10,880 --> 01:52:14,440
I'd have slashed your throat
the day you came home.

1771
01:52:15,120 --> 01:52:18,720
It's been a long time since
someone held a knife to my throat.

1772
01:52:18,800 --> 01:52:20,680
I don't even remember what it feels like.

1773
01:52:21,240 --> 01:52:22,520
But now...

1774
01:52:22,720 --> 01:52:26,480
-a certain black sheep is trying
to hold a knife to my throat.

1775
01:52:27,640 --> 01:52:30,840
When I think that the black
sheep could be one of my own...

1776
01:52:30,880 --> 01:52:32,360
-that makes me angry.

1777
01:52:32,800 --> 01:52:35,440
And that's why you need
a friend by your side.

1778
01:52:38,240 --> 01:52:41,440
You look at people as enemies or traitors.

1779
01:52:42,520 --> 01:52:44,000
You just won't get it.

1780
01:52:46,880 --> 01:52:50,440
A slave will be loyal and
lay at my feet till the end.

1781
01:52:51,120 --> 01:52:52,400
But a friend...

1782
01:52:52,960 --> 01:52:55,080
can turn into a traitor any time.

1783
01:52:55,120 --> 01:52:57,160
You know that only too well!

1784
01:52:58,480 --> 01:53:01,480
We found Maari's location.
He is in Tenkasi.

1785
01:53:01,960 --> 01:53:04,920
Take 10 of our men. Find him and his son.

1786
01:53:04,960 --> 01:53:06,800
I'll get there after I sort out this case.

1787
01:53:06,840 --> 01:53:08,600
We don't need 10 people.

1788
01:53:08,640 --> 01:53:10,360
He's timid as a mouse now.

1789
01:53:10,400 --> 01:53:12,360
Even today, he had a problem
with the Councillor.

1790
01:53:12,400 --> 01:53:14,240
He went and begged his forgiveness.

1791
01:53:14,360 --> 01:53:15,120
What?

1792
01:53:15,160 --> 01:53:18,480
I enquired at several places.
I even tried threatening people.

1793
01:53:18,520 --> 01:53:20,520
I've poked around the
entire police department.

1794
01:53:20,560 --> 01:53:22,720
But I couldn't find
anything about the informer.

1795
01:53:22,760 --> 01:53:25,600
You will know who he is
when he comes to court tomorrow.

1796
01:53:26,160 --> 01:53:28,400
He shouldn't cross the court entry gates.

1797
01:53:28,440 --> 01:53:31,000
- Kill him in front of everyone.
- Okay

1798
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,480
Long Live Beeja! Long Live Beeja!

1799
01:54:08,560 --> 01:54:11,240
Long Live Beeja! Long Live Beeja!

1800
01:54:14,040 --> 01:54:16,960
Down with Vijaya! Down with Vijaya!

1801
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,600
Down with Vijaya! Down with Vijaya!

1802
01:54:19,680 --> 01:54:22,600
Down with Vijaya! Down with Vijaya!

1803
01:54:33,480 --> 01:54:35,280
He has to come past you.

1804
01:54:35,320 --> 01:54:37,200
When he gets close,
just plunge the knife into him.

1805
01:54:37,240 --> 01:54:40,520
If the witness comes with security...

1806
01:54:40,600 --> 01:54:43,520
I'll do something to create a diversion.

1807
01:54:43,560 --> 01:54:45,000
Then you'll have to get him.

1808
01:54:45,040 --> 01:54:47,440
Spot the informer and kill him.

1809
01:54:51,560 --> 01:54:54,320
Maari does live here.
The information was true.

1810
01:54:54,360 --> 01:54:56,080
He did meet the Councillor.

1811
01:54:56,120 --> 01:54:58,480
But the story we heard
about Maari apologising...

1812
01:54:58,520 --> 01:54:59,840
that's not true.

1813
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:03,000
I'll take leave.

1814
01:55:03,880 --> 01:55:05,520
Wait up.

1815
01:55:05,560 --> 01:55:07,000
We can forget it...

1816
01:55:07,040 --> 01:55:09,440
but those who saw my
boy getting hit won't forget.

1817
01:55:09,480 --> 01:55:10,760
Let's do this.

1818
01:55:11,200 --> 01:55:12,280
Tomorrow...

1819
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:17,680
my son will break your son's
limbs in front of everyone.

1820
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:22,360
I will bear all his hospital expenses!

1821
01:55:22,480 --> 01:55:24,000
Give it to him.

1822
01:55:24,120 --> 01:55:26,840
Here. You will bring
your son over tomorrow.

1823
01:55:26,880 --> 01:55:29,440
We'll break his limbs and send him back.

1824
01:55:29,480 --> 01:55:30,360
Take it.

1825
01:55:32,800 --> 01:55:34,120
Here...

1826
01:55:34,840 --> 01:55:36,000
After you wake up...

1827
01:55:36,040 --> 01:55:38,880
tell your boss that he should
stay away from me and my son.

1828
01:55:38,920 --> 01:55:40,680
After I wake up?

1829
01:55:59,720 --> 01:56:00,880
You buggers...

1830
01:56:01,200 --> 01:56:04,600
I used to kill time by smoking
cigarettes and thrashing people.

1831
01:56:04,880 --> 01:56:08,320
I can't smoke cigarettes
freely because my son doesn't like it.

1832
01:56:08,560 --> 01:56:10,040
Let's kill some time?

1833
01:57:28,440 --> 01:57:31,800
From tomorrow, your son must not
attend the school my son goes to.

1834
01:57:32,280 --> 01:57:34,200
You must not do any business in this town.

1835
01:57:34,360 --> 01:57:36,080
You must not live in this town.

1836
01:57:36,440 --> 01:57:39,360
I must never lay eyes on your face.

1837
01:57:39,760 --> 01:57:42,400
If I ever lay eyes on you...

1838
01:57:46,400 --> 01:57:47,680
I will rip you apart.

1839
01:58:00,440 --> 01:58:01,640
An auto is coming this way.

1840
01:58:01,720 --> 01:58:04,000
See if the lawyers are
showing any reaction?

1841
01:58:04,080 --> 01:58:05,920
They're getting ready.

1842
01:58:06,120 --> 01:58:07,640
Looks like he is the guy.

1843
01:59:15,760 --> 01:59:17,240
That's the Maari I wanted to see.

1844
01:59:17,280 --> 01:59:19,840
Now you're a worthy adversary.

1845
01:59:23,800 --> 01:59:25,000
Not good enough!

1846
01:59:25,200 --> 01:59:26,800
Your act is not good enough.

1847
01:59:26,960 --> 01:59:28,840
I see fear in your eyes!

1848
01:59:29,280 --> 01:59:30,320
You're the informer?

1849
01:59:30,360 --> 01:59:32,000
We know who the informer is...

1850
01:59:32,040 --> 01:59:35,000
But if you want to find the informer,
you have to get past Maari.

1851
01:59:35,040 --> 01:59:38,560
Judging by the fear in your men's eyes,
you should know that's not possible.

1852
01:59:38,600 --> 01:59:40,920
Why didn't you bring the informer today?

1853
01:59:41,200 --> 01:59:42,840
You gave me one chance.

1854
01:59:43,400 --> 01:59:45,640
Now I'm giving you one chance.

1855
01:59:46,360 --> 01:59:50,240
Withdraw your candidature,
apologise to Kalai and his family...

1856
01:59:50,280 --> 01:59:52,520
forget the fact that I even have a son...

1857
01:59:52,560 --> 01:59:55,240
and go settle down in the place
meant for psychos like you.

1858
01:59:55,280 --> 01:59:59,200
If I see you around, one SMACK!
and ZAP! You're finished.

1859
02:00:00,680 --> 02:00:02,160
You're giving me a chance?

1860
02:00:02,960 --> 02:00:06,120
This case will disappear
without a trace tonight.

1861
02:00:06,160 --> 02:00:09,600
Your informer will be a corpse
by the time he comes to court tomorrow.

1862
02:00:09,760 --> 02:00:11,200
And I will kill your son...

1863
02:00:11,240 --> 02:00:12,200
Kaali!

1864
02:00:18,280 --> 02:00:19,600
Try touching him.

1865
02:00:22,080 --> 02:00:23,200
Touch him!

1866
02:00:25,240 --> 02:00:26,640
Touch him!

1867
02:00:34,200 --> 02:00:36,480
You still don't know me too well.

1868
02:00:37,120 --> 02:00:39,400
I'm a very, very bad man.

1869
02:00:46,320 --> 02:00:48,040
If you are bad...

1870
02:00:48,400 --> 02:00:49,840
I am your dad.

1871
02:01:08,080 --> 02:01:10,320
Without providing details
about the witness beforehand...

1872
02:01:10,360 --> 02:01:12,960
the Prosecution cannot
produce the witness for a hearing.

1873
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,520
We demand that they
produce the witness right now.

1874
02:01:15,920 --> 02:01:18,920
Revealing the witness' identity will
endanger their life, Your Honour.

1875
02:01:18,960 --> 02:01:22,400
Since the Prosecution failed
to produce their witness...

1876
02:01:22,440 --> 02:01:24,880
the case hearing
is adjourned to tomorrow.

1877
02:01:25,120 --> 02:01:29,000
In tomorrow's morning session
you must reveal the witness.

1878
02:01:29,240 --> 02:01:32,760
It's the police department's duty
to provide adequate protection.

1879
02:01:32,840 --> 02:01:34,160
Court dismissed.

1880
02:01:36,680 --> 02:01:40,160
We have a problem if the witness
testifies tomorrow.

1881
02:01:40,320 --> 02:01:43,440
If we kill him after that,
the blame would naturally fall on us.

1882
02:01:43,680 --> 02:01:45,880
I need to know his identity tonight.

1883
02:01:46,240 --> 02:01:47,560
He must die.

1884
02:01:49,160 --> 02:01:50,800
Move away

1885
02:01:50,840 --> 02:01:52,160
Come here

1886
02:01:53,080 --> 02:01:54,880
Who are you talking to?

1887
02:01:55,480 --> 02:01:56,680
Nobody.

1888
02:01:56,960 --> 02:01:59,080
We've built this case
with great difficulty.

1889
02:01:59,640 --> 02:02:03,520
We need to ensure the black sheep in
our department doesn't leak information.

1890
02:02:03,880 --> 02:02:06,440
Please find out who that informer is?

1891
02:02:06,680 --> 02:02:09,840
It's not as easy as you think.

1892
02:02:10,040 --> 02:02:11,840
It's easier than you think.

1893
02:02:11,920 --> 02:02:15,120
Important informers like these
communicate with the boss directly.

1894
02:02:15,320 --> 02:02:18,240
If you follow the boss
and see who he talks to...

1895
02:02:18,280 --> 02:02:20,360
-the black sheep will
automatically get caught.

1896
02:02:28,480 --> 02:02:30,480
I heard Maari came to court today?

1897
02:02:30,560 --> 02:02:32,160
You didn't go to see him?

1898
02:02:33,400 --> 02:02:34,880
How will I face him?

1899
02:02:36,320 --> 02:02:37,640
He is your friend, right?

1900
02:02:39,200 --> 02:02:40,320
I don't know.

1901
02:02:44,600 --> 02:02:46,280
- Kalai's house?
- Yes...

1902
02:02:53,720 --> 02:02:54,800
Saturday!

1903
02:02:55,480 --> 02:02:57,800
You've changed completely!
How are you?

1904
02:02:58,080 --> 02:03:00,080
I'm good.
How are you?

1905
02:03:00,320 --> 02:03:01,640
I'm okay.

1906
02:03:02,120 --> 02:03:02,880
Come.

1907
02:03:06,480 --> 02:03:08,320
This is Kaali.
Maari's son.

1908
02:03:14,320 --> 02:03:17,840
When I heard about you,
I really longed to see you.

1909
02:03:20,320 --> 02:03:22,040
But your father
was angry with me.

1910
02:03:22,400 --> 02:03:23,760
That's why I couldn't come.

1911
02:03:23,800 --> 02:03:25,560
Why is my father angry with you?

1912
02:03:26,920 --> 02:03:29,400
It was my fault.
I fought with him.

1913
02:03:29,440 --> 02:03:31,040
He fought back with you?

1914
02:03:31,080 --> 02:03:33,160
I would have preferred
if he had fought back.

1915
02:03:34,040 --> 02:03:36,760
But he forgave me,
and walked away.

1916
02:03:36,960 --> 02:03:38,440
I made a mistake, Kaali.

1917
02:03:38,680 --> 02:03:39,840
Your father's anger...

1918
02:03:40,440 --> 02:03:41,400
is justified.

1919
02:03:41,600 --> 02:03:43,040
You are Kalai?

1920
02:03:43,320 --> 02:03:44,240
Yes!

1921
02:03:44,760 --> 02:03:46,520
Your father mentioned me?

1922
02:03:46,560 --> 02:03:48,160
Oh, yes. Lots!

1923
02:03:49,120 --> 02:03:50,120
What did he say?

1924
02:03:50,160 --> 02:03:53,280
He said the first friend and best friend
he got in his life...

1925
02:03:53,320 --> 02:03:54,320
is you.

1926
02:03:57,440 --> 02:03:58,840
This is Kalai's house?

1927
02:03:59,600 --> 02:04:01,280
Uncle, my father is here.

1928
02:04:05,840 --> 02:04:07,400
- Have you eaten?
- Yes, dad.

1929
02:04:15,720 --> 02:04:17,280
Even after I became an enemy...

1930
02:04:17,840 --> 02:04:19,120
and a traitor...

1931
02:04:20,320 --> 02:04:22,240
you still remain a friend.

1932
02:04:24,080 --> 02:04:26,840
Forget it.
You didn't do anything!

1933
02:04:28,440 --> 02:04:29,240
Come on!

1934
02:04:29,640 --> 02:04:30,760
You're crying?

1935
02:04:31,480 --> 02:04:32,960
It doesn't suit you.

1936
02:04:35,800 --> 02:04:36,720
Maari...

1937
02:04:37,200 --> 02:04:38,680
I'm not the informer.

1938
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:40,920
I know.

1939
02:05:08,560 --> 02:05:09,480
Hello?

1940
02:05:10,200 --> 02:05:11,680
I'm on my way there.

1941
02:05:49,600 --> 02:05:51,120
What's going on?

1942
02:05:51,160 --> 02:05:54,200
Listen to me, Beeja.
All this is out of my control.

1943
02:05:54,440 --> 02:05:56,840
I gave you information
because I trusted you.

1944
02:05:56,880 --> 02:05:59,320
Now, you have another informer to get me?

1945
02:05:59,360 --> 02:06:01,960
Stop saying that!
I didn't plant any informer.

1946
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:03,960
You are my only informer.

1947
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,640
The Joint Secretary has someone else.

1948
02:06:06,680 --> 02:06:08,120
I trusted you...till yesterday.

1949
02:06:08,160 --> 02:06:11,040
But now, even Maari tells me
there is someone in the gang.

1950
02:06:11,080 --> 02:06:12,760
You're playing a double game?

1951
02:06:14,400 --> 02:06:19,040
The information you provide is just bribe
for me to not take action against you.

1952
02:06:19,080 --> 02:06:20,640
Instead of locking you up
behind bars...

1953
02:06:20,680 --> 02:06:23,400
I'm rounding up other rowdies
using the information you give me.

1954
02:06:23,440 --> 02:06:24,520
Rascal!

1955
02:06:24,560 --> 02:06:28,520
Maybe someone else is using
an official higher than me.

1956
02:06:28,560 --> 02:06:30,800
How do you know that's not the case?

1957
02:06:30,840 --> 02:06:32,320
- Stop asking me...
- You rascal!

1958
02:06:32,560 --> 02:06:34,280
You are the informer?

1959
02:06:34,320 --> 02:06:36,320
What are you doing here?
- Be quiet, sir!

1960
02:06:36,480 --> 02:06:39,640
I'm looking all over the town
to find the informer to save you...

1961
02:06:39,680 --> 02:06:42,480
-and you are ratting out
your own people?

1962
02:06:42,520 --> 02:06:43,600
Yes, I am!

1963
02:06:43,720 --> 02:06:46,400
This is how I cleaned up
my past records.

1964
02:06:46,800 --> 02:06:49,560
You can't even find out
who the other informer is...

1965
02:06:49,600 --> 02:06:51,120
-you have the gall
to question me?

1966
02:06:51,160 --> 02:06:52,640
You can never find out.

1967
02:06:59,680 --> 02:07:01,600
That informer doesn't exist.

1968
02:07:01,640 --> 02:07:03,600
So who is that witness?

1969
02:07:03,960 --> 02:07:07,480
It was a lie fabricated to reveal
your true colours to everyone.

1970
02:07:23,680 --> 02:07:25,040
What are you looking at?

1971
02:07:26,120 --> 02:07:29,400
All of them belong to the gangs
of rowdies you got arrested.

1972
02:07:29,720 --> 02:07:32,520
I trusted you and came here.
So many people know this place?

1973
02:07:33,040 --> 02:07:34,600
I don't want to be a part of this!

1974
02:07:34,800 --> 02:07:36,280
I'm leaving.

1975
02:07:36,960 --> 02:07:38,200
- Hey!
- Leave me

1976
02:07:38,240 --> 02:07:39,400
Let that man go.

1977
02:07:39,440 --> 02:07:41,120
The black sheep is right here.

1978
02:07:44,240 --> 02:07:47,080
How do you like
Maari's plot against you?

1979
02:07:47,800 --> 02:07:49,720
Please let me do that properly.

1980
02:07:51,320 --> 02:07:53,240
'Beeja is a informer'

1981
02:07:53,280 --> 02:07:55,200
How do you know
Beeja is the informer?

1982
02:07:55,320 --> 02:07:57,320
I've got ears everywhere, too.

1983
02:07:57,680 --> 02:08:00,000
This is just a job to you.
But it's my life!

1984
02:08:00,040 --> 02:08:01,360
I know these things.

1985
02:08:01,520 --> 02:08:04,320
If he has the Commissioner's support,
getting him will be harder.

1986
02:08:04,360 --> 02:08:06,800
If I tell this to other gangs,
no one would believe me.

1987
02:08:06,840 --> 02:08:09,240
That's your problem.
My part is done.

1988
02:08:09,280 --> 02:08:10,520
Maari, hang on.

1989
02:08:10,560 --> 02:08:12,600
They'll believe it
only if you tell them.

1990
02:08:13,080 --> 02:08:14,320
'Remember what Mother said?'

1991
02:08:14,360 --> 02:08:18,640
'When I see somebody hurting another
person, I should make it stop, right?'

1992
02:08:18,960 --> 02:08:21,440
'Or they will go on and hurt someone else.'

1993
02:08:23,240 --> 02:08:24,240
Madam...

1994
02:08:24,600 --> 02:08:25,600
I'll come

1995
02:08:25,960 --> 02:08:27,320
I'll come. For my son.

1996
02:08:28,560 --> 02:08:30,000
On one condition.

1997
02:08:30,640 --> 02:08:34,200
Arrange a hearing against Beeja
at the court.

1998
02:08:34,240 --> 02:08:36,120
- What case?
- A false case.

1999
02:08:36,160 --> 02:08:38,640
The drug smuggling case against Beeja
has become strong...

2000
02:08:38,720 --> 02:08:40,840
A case has been filed against you, Beeja.

2001
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:43,880
We need to make him believe that a
non-existent witness will appear in court.

2002
02:08:43,920 --> 02:08:45,840
I don't know anything
about the informer.

2003
02:08:45,880 --> 02:08:48,320
You will know who he is
when he comes to court tomorrow.

2004
02:08:48,360 --> 02:08:51,960
We need to make him believe
there is another informer in his own gang.

2005
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:55,400
A certain black sheep is trying to
hold a knife to my throat.

2006
02:08:55,440 --> 02:08:57,840
He will definitely go
to see the Commissioner.

2007
02:08:57,880 --> 02:09:00,480
I'll take it from there.
I have an old score to settle.

2008
02:09:00,560 --> 02:09:02,000
Is this really you?

2009
02:09:02,080 --> 02:09:04,680
It's not a false case.
The crimes are real.

2010
02:09:04,720 --> 02:09:05,920
Just one thing...

2011
02:09:05,960 --> 02:09:08,920
We're going to hide the identity
of the witness till the very end...

2012
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:11,480
and eventually say
the witness didn't turn up.

2013
02:09:11,520 --> 02:09:12,760
We're breaking just one rule.

2014
02:09:12,800 --> 02:09:15,400
We've got the evidence
against Beeja, like you asked.

2015
02:09:15,720 --> 02:09:18,560
I just need your help to fast-track
the case, like you promised.

2016
02:09:18,600 --> 02:09:21,240
- Who is the witness?
- Sir, hope you don't mistake me...

2017
02:09:21,280 --> 02:09:24,720
I think it's safer to keep his identity
a secret till the end.

2018
02:09:24,960 --> 02:09:26,560
It's definitely not your informer.

2019
02:09:26,720 --> 02:09:28,680
Okay!
I understand.

2020
02:09:30,040 --> 02:09:31,200
Are you the informer?

2021
02:09:31,240 --> 02:09:32,840
We know who the informer is...

2022
02:09:32,880 --> 02:09:35,560
But if you want to find the informer,
you have to get past Maari.

2023
02:09:35,600 --> 02:09:37,880
You must reveal
details about the witness.

2024
02:09:37,920 --> 02:09:39,800
I need to know his identity tonight.

2025
02:09:39,840 --> 02:09:41,760
The informer who ratted on your
boss will get caught tonight.

2026
02:09:41,800 --> 02:09:42,960
Follow the Commissioner.

2027
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:45,400
- He is dead tonight.
- I'm leaving right away!

2028
02:09:45,600 --> 02:09:47,120
- Let's go.
- Okay, boss!

2029
02:09:47,160 --> 02:09:50,160
If you follow the boss
and see who he talks to...

2030
02:09:50,200 --> 02:09:52,080
-the black sheep will
automatically get caught.

2031
02:09:52,120 --> 02:09:54,440
You think only you
can play mind games?

2032
02:09:54,480 --> 02:09:55,600
We can't play this game?

2033
02:09:55,680 --> 02:09:56,760
He's finished you off.

2034
02:09:57,160 --> 02:10:00,160
What did you say?
You are the God of Death?

2035
02:10:00,920 --> 02:10:02,800
Get ready for the prayer.

2036
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:09,760
Come on!
I dare you.

2037
02:10:09,960 --> 02:10:11,440
I've seen worse.

2038
02:10:12,280 --> 02:10:14,680
You think you can live
after going against me?

2039
02:10:15,080 --> 02:10:16,840
The Commissioner is on my side.

2040
02:10:16,880 --> 02:10:18,880
I'm the God of Death!

2041
02:10:20,640 --> 02:10:22,280
Stand by me.

2042
02:10:23,040 --> 02:10:24,120
Or...

2043
02:10:24,480 --> 02:10:26,080
die right here.

2044
02:10:42,200 --> 02:10:44,280
The Commissioner must not
leave this area.

2045
02:10:44,360 --> 02:10:45,600
Get him back here.

2046
02:10:47,560 --> 02:10:50,640
You fools!
Will you never learn?

2047
02:10:57,360 --> 02:11:00,520
Beeja, I made a mistake.
Please forgive me.

2048
02:11:07,360 --> 02:11:10,080
I acted in haste.
I'm begging you...

2049
02:11:10,520 --> 02:11:12,560
I'm always at your service.

2050
02:11:50,560 --> 02:11:53,760
Just like your brother,
you're going to die in flames.

2051
02:12:18,360 --> 02:12:20,080
You got stabbed
in the back, too?

2052
02:12:20,120 --> 02:12:22,560
I've fought for 10 years
to get to where I am.

2053
02:12:23,160 --> 02:12:26,400
You've brought me back to square one
within a single day?

2054
02:12:26,440 --> 02:12:28,720
I should have killed you
and your son that day.

2055
02:12:28,760 --> 02:12:29,880
I'll do it now.

2056
02:12:29,920 --> 02:12:33,040
Just like I killed your brother.
Just like I killed your wife.

2057
02:12:33,080 --> 02:12:35,240
You are going to die today.

2058
02:12:39,280 --> 02:12:42,360
Your rotten tooth, psychotic behaviour,
your drawings...

2059
02:12:42,400 --> 02:12:44,400
-none of this scared me.

2060
02:12:44,440 --> 02:12:47,160
But these long monologues you speak
every time you see me...

2061
02:12:47,200 --> 02:12:48,400
-that really scares me.

2062
02:12:48,480 --> 02:12:49,400
You should cut it short.

2063
02:12:49,440 --> 02:12:51,320
Let's just get to the fight.
Please!

2064
02:16:58,800 --> 02:16:59,720
Here, Maari.

2065
02:17:09,520 --> 02:17:15,880
Everytime you feel for being unable to walk,
you must think about my Anandi.

2066
02:17:17,960 --> 02:17:22,080
A man who fights to live is
stronger than a man who fights to kill.

2067
02:17:26,040 --> 02:17:30,480
Based on the evidence provided,
the accused Gangadhar Beeja...

2068
02:17:30,520 --> 02:17:34,960
-has been proven guilty beyond doubt
by the Prosecution.

2069
02:17:35,120 --> 02:17:39,120
According to Section IPC 302...

2070
02:17:39,160 --> 02:17:43,680
he is found guilty on 28 accounts for murder
and is hereby sentenced to life in prison.

2071
02:17:43,800 --> 02:17:45,400
Don't act too cool.
Calm down.

2072
02:17:45,440 --> 02:17:47,400
Beeja entrusted me
with all the responsibilities.

2073
02:17:47,440 --> 02:17:49,280
- Oh yeah?
- You can't enter our hood.

2074
02:17:49,320 --> 02:17:50,600
We'll break your bones.

2075
02:17:50,640 --> 02:17:52,960
- It's a challenge.
- We'll see.

2076
02:17:57,720 --> 02:18:00,640
My hood, my rules.

2077
02:18:01,120 --> 02:18:02,320
I will finish you off.
