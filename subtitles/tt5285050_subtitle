1
00:01:50,356 --> 00:01:54,605
And now the final event
of our school's Sports Meet...

2
00:01:54,855 --> 00:01:57,688
The marathon race is about to begin.

3
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:01,272
Whether you manage to
complete the 7 rounds...

4
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:05,770
Or give up in the first
or second round…

5
00:02:06,022 --> 00:02:07,064
...that doesn't matter.

6
00:02:07,356 --> 00:02:10,855
It's heartening to see so many participants.

7
00:02:11,189 --> 00:02:15,397
Let’s wish the best to all the students
participating in the marathon.

8
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:18,897
The event is about to begin.

9
00:02:19,397 --> 00:02:21,064
Boys, listen carefully...

10
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:23,356
GIRL: Get lost.

11
00:02:23,397 --> 00:02:26,647
You shall abide by the rules.

12
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,813
Go on and run, boy.

13
00:02:29,772 --> 00:02:33,397
You’re going to run?
That’s an insult to me. Go away!

14
00:02:33,939 --> 00:02:36,189
Particpants must take this seriously.

15
00:02:36,397 --> 00:02:41,730
We all know why some boys
are participating...

16
00:02:42,189 --> 00:02:45,795
If you're here just to show off,
leave the grounds immediately.

17
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:46,736
Check that out!

18
00:02:47,689 --> 00:02:48,439
What?

19
00:02:51,397 --> 00:02:57,022
If YOU manage to complete even one round,
I will chop my ear off.

20
00:03:00,855 --> 00:03:04,064
He’s going to run now?
Dream on.

21
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:06,459
The marathon for boys is about to begin.

22
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:08,688
The boys are all set.

23
00:03:10,564 --> 00:03:15,189
Our sports teacher has blown the whistle...
The boys have started to run.

24
00:03:15,397 --> 00:03:18,521
Wow! Our boys are running with a lot of energy.

25
00:03:19,356 --> 00:03:24,521
They are running with the determination to win!

26
00:03:25,016 --> 00:03:26,512
Our boys are pretty good.

27
00:03:26,671 --> 00:03:29,421
Make way, boy.
At least let the others run.

28
00:03:29,624 --> 00:03:31,041
Round 1 is complete.

29
00:03:31,397 --> 00:03:34,397
As expected, some 10 students
have walked out.

30
00:03:35,527 --> 00:03:38,027
Round 2 has begun.

31
00:03:38,397 --> 00:03:40,272
...and our boys continue to run.

32
00:03:42,272 --> 00:03:44,397
A group of 10 have given up.

33
00:03:45,688 --> 00:03:47,855
Round 5 has begun.

34
00:03:52,268 --> 00:03:54,601
Let's see how many make it past this round.

35
00:03:54,729 --> 00:03:57,468
Here and there, I see boys crashing out
in fatigue.

36
00:03:57,535 --> 00:04:02,672
But a few students, relentless,
keep on running.

37
00:04:03,023 --> 00:04:04,689
Another 4 boys have given up!

38
00:04:05,029 --> 00:04:07,196
Round 6 has begun.

39
00:04:07,649 --> 00:04:10,607
If YOU manage to complete even one round…

40
00:04:21,064 --> 00:04:23,688
This boy looks like a balloon,
but runs quite well!

41
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,356
He'll get punctured now!

42
00:04:35,147 --> 00:04:36,397
He might just win, eh?

43
00:04:52,397 --> 00:04:55,230
No, no, no.
Hold the applause now.

44
00:04:55,397 --> 00:04:57,605
The boy who finished now
is not the winner.

45
00:04:58,314 --> 00:05:01,147
He has just started running his 7th round.

46
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,051
Quit it, that's enough!

47
00:05:06,975 --> 00:05:09,267
Hey, Fatso! The race is over.
Get off the track.

48
00:05:09,292 --> 00:05:15,708
He’s running with great vigour
to somehow finish 7 rounds.

49
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:33,397
He said I can’t finish even a single round.

50
00:05:33,939 --> 00:05:35,397
I’ve completed 7 rounds.

51
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:37,397
Can't mess with me!

52
00:05:38,356 --> 00:05:41,813
Our headmaster will now address the gathering.

53
00:05:42,647 --> 00:05:43,647
Greetings, one and all.

54
00:05:44,397 --> 00:05:47,980
Our school’s Sports Meet
was a grand success.

55
00:05:49,064 --> 00:05:53,521
I congratulate the boys and girls
who participated and won in today’s events.

56
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:57,922
Our School’s Sports Committee
has arrived at a decision:

57
00:05:58,272 --> 00:05:59,730
To present a special prize.

58
00:05:59,897 --> 00:06:03,397
It’s for our student who finished last in the marathon.

59
00:06:03,952 --> 00:06:06,701
Named Tamizh Nadan.

60
00:06:07,397 --> 00:06:08,022
For me?

61
00:06:08,147 --> 00:06:10,605
“Why are they giving a prize to
the boy who came last?”

62
00:06:10,688 --> 00:06:13,022
“And a special prize!”,
you may wonder.

63
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:16,147
Life is a lot like a marathon, isn’t it?

64
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:18,147
We all run towards success;

65
00:06:18,521 --> 00:06:22,105
Some make it to the Finish Line.
And some give up in Round 1.

66
00:06:22,397 --> 00:06:25,521
When Tamizh Nadan ran,
many cheered for him.

67
00:06:26,105 --> 00:06:28,855
A few doubted him.
And a few laughed at him.

68
00:06:29,105 --> 00:06:30,314
Life works in similar ways.

69
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:33,647
Some will applaud you as you run;
Some will laugh.

70
00:06:34,022 --> 00:06:37,230
Our Tamizh Nadan ignored the jibes…

71
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:41,504
He preserved his self respect
by running till the end.

72
00:06:41,956 --> 00:06:45,748
He will go places in his life.

73
00:06:46,897 --> 00:06:49,480
We conclude by saying,
perspiration is victory.

74
00:06:49,563 --> 00:06:52,730
We congratulate Tamizh Nadan
and present him with this prize.

75
00:07:05,405 --> 00:07:16,322
PASANGA 2

76
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:45,064
Good.
The baby looks healthy.

77
00:07:49,147 --> 00:07:51,356
Don’t miss the monthly check ups.
Okay?

78
00:07:51,772 --> 00:07:53,230
All the best.
-Thank you, Doctor.

79
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:54,189
Thank you, Ma'am.

80
00:08:13,647 --> 00:08:14,688
The baby is healthy.

81
00:08:16,272 --> 00:08:17,022
Thank you!

82
00:08:21,356 --> 00:08:22,189
Divya!

83
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:23,605
I’m coming.

84
00:08:27,356 --> 00:08:29,314
Divya! Come soon.

85
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:31,230
It’s getting late.

86
00:08:32,105 --> 00:08:32,939
Okay, sure.

87
00:08:37,189 --> 00:08:37,813
Yes?

88
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,397
Akhil, what are you doing?

89
00:08:39,521 --> 00:08:40,688
I am working, of course.

90
00:08:41,272 --> 00:08:42,397
I’ll call you later!

91
00:09:22,272 --> 00:09:23,730
Did you buy the saffron petals?

92
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:25,147
I forgot.

93
00:09:26,688 --> 00:09:27,939
I forgot!

94
00:09:28,105 --> 00:09:29,022
You forgot?

95
00:09:45,605 --> 00:09:46,438
Akhil...

96
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:51,147
It’s easier to get admission at Akshaya’s school
if we register online before the birth.

97
00:09:51,647 --> 00:09:52,647
Already?

98
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,480
It’s the Number 1 school!

99
00:09:54,897 --> 00:09:56,189
How did you rate it Number 1?

100
00:09:56,939 --> 00:10:00,397
They charge the most fees.
So they must provide quality education, right?

101
00:10:00,813 --> 00:10:03,521
They even refused admission
to the Education Minister’s grandson.

102
00:10:03,855 --> 00:10:04,813
Mind it.

103
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,605
What’s the school’s site address?

104
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,064
He’s kicking!

105
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,772
He’s kicking, see?

106
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:21,064
Where?
-He’s stopped now.

107
00:10:24,772 --> 00:10:28,980
I’ve performed 160 operations
on auspicious dates fixed by this astrologer.

108
00:10:29,272 --> 00:10:30,480
He’s a lucky charm.

109
00:10:30,688 --> 00:10:33,480
Wait and watch your life change.

110
00:10:34,147 --> 00:10:36,314
I’m a little nervous about the operation.

111
00:10:36,438 --> 00:10:39,314
This is easier than a normal delivery.

112
00:10:39,563 --> 00:10:41,647
Oh, I see.
-It’s the trend now.

113
00:10:41,772 --> 00:10:43,189
What do you want your child to be?

114
00:10:43,647 --> 00:10:45,272
Actually, a doctor.

115
00:10:46,939 --> 00:10:48,813
Engineer?
-Fine! A doctor.

116
00:10:49,647 --> 00:10:50,230
Okay?

117
00:10:50,688 --> 00:10:51,730
Doctor it is.

118
00:10:51,939 --> 00:10:54,064
For a doctor…

119
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:57,314
Keeping in mind your birth stars…

120
00:10:57,563 --> 00:11:01,189
October the 15th, at 10: 40 in the morning…

121
00:11:01,189 --> 00:11:03,105
Undergo the operation and deliver the baby.

122
00:11:03,147 --> 00:11:05,897
With the Taurus moon and Libra sun sign,
the child will be prosperous.

123
00:11:06,022 --> 00:11:07,521
You will lead a flourishing life, too.

124
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:18,230
Divya has delivered the baby.

125
00:11:18,314 --> 00:11:21,605
What? She went into labour
in seven and a half months?

126
00:11:22,105 --> 00:11:23,189
No complications, right?

127
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:25,230
No complications.
We ran a thorough check.

128
00:11:25,314 --> 00:11:26,521
Show me the Apgar score…

129
00:11:28,064 --> 00:11:32,480
The baby’s heartbeat, breathing, reflexes,
sneezing and crying...

130
00:11:32,521 --> 00:11:34,813
...are the five factors to evaluate the baby.

131
00:11:34,939 --> 00:11:37,147
Your baby’s total score is
seven and a half.

132
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:39,730
Note down the baby’s birth time.
It’s half past seven.

133
00:11:40,772 --> 00:11:41,397
Doctor…

134
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:45,605
He was born after seven and half months.
His score is seven and half too.

135
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:47,480
The time of birth is half past seven too.

136
00:11:47,647 --> 00:11:51,356
All this seven and a half...
Isn't seven and a half a bad omen?

137
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:53,397
Only time will tell.

138
00:12:04,521 --> 00:12:07,105
My name shall cause tremors!

139
00:12:10,022 --> 00:12:10,980
I’m waiting.

140
00:12:32,356 --> 00:12:36,022
Want to see me throw a punch?
Huh?

141
00:12:39,563 --> 00:12:48,939
"I have become a superhero;
I am the strongest!"

142
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:58,772
"I’ll go exploring, just like Dora;
Are there more places to go?"

143
00:12:59,147 --> 00:13:08,813
"I can fight, zooming through the air;
Ninjas don’t have rules"

144
00:13:09,314 --> 00:13:13,022
"Short and sweet, like a Haiku."

145
00:13:13,813 --> 00:13:18,105
"We will dance and sing, like heroes."

146
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:28,022
"I have become a superhero;
I am the strongest!"

147
00:13:28,189 --> 00:13:37,480
"I’ll go exploring, just like Dora;
Are there more places to go?"

148
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:13,397
"Check out my hair's spike;
I'm riding an air bike."

149
00:14:13,521 --> 00:14:18,105
"My hands are my mic;
That's how I speak."

150
00:14:18,397 --> 00:14:22,980
"The sky is my paper;
My pencil, skyscraper."

151
00:14:23,314 --> 00:14:27,772
"I can sketch or paint;
Or even throw it away."

152
00:14:27,897 --> 00:14:32,730
"Rainbows...
Are our rollerskates!"

153
00:14:32,813 --> 00:14:37,022
"The moon...
Is our vanilla cake!"

154
00:14:37,105 --> 00:14:41,730
"I want an  ice-cream ocean;
And I want a chocolate nation."

155
00:14:41,939 --> 00:14:47,397
"Examination nation nation nation...
Don't want that!"

156
00:14:47,939 --> 00:14:52,147
"Short and sweet, like a Haiku."

157
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:57,356
"We will dance and sing, like heroes."

158
00:14:57,521 --> 00:15:04,688
"I have become a superhero;
I am the strongest!"

159
00:15:04,813 --> 00:15:06,730
She keeps talking back to her teachers.

160
00:15:06,897 --> 00:15:10,147
Never obeys.
Always “Why this, why that?”

161
00:15:12,105 --> 00:15:14,480
We spend two hundred thousand
per year on her.

162
00:15:14,688 --> 00:15:15,897
What if this goes on?

163
00:15:26,688 --> 00:15:28,939
Is your son hyperactive?

164
00:15:29,064 --> 00:15:31,730
Isn’t that why
he keeps shifting schools every year?

165
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,730
We’re closed for admissions this year.
Maybe next year. All the best!

166
00:15:42,688 --> 00:15:45,688
Your son argues a lot.
He’s very indisciplined.

167
00:15:45,897 --> 00:15:48,230
Please put him in some special needs school.

168
00:15:53,813 --> 00:15:55,521
She’s hyperactive and restless.

169
00:15:56,105 --> 00:15:58,521
She won’t sit calmly in one place.

170
00:15:58,772 --> 00:16:02,521
Her eyes are always searching for something.
She argues a lot.

171
00:16:02,813 --> 00:16:05,897
The teachers say she’s a bad influence
on the other children.

172
00:16:06,105 --> 00:16:07,772
She’s so mischievous!

173
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,855
We’ve shifted four schools
and four apartments for her.

174
00:16:11,813 --> 00:16:14,022
Looking after her for a day
feels like a year.

175
00:16:14,605 --> 00:16:17,647
The idea of having another child
gives me the creeps.

176
00:16:18,397 --> 00:16:20,314
How does she study? And her speech?

177
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:23,230
She studies hard, but fails in the exams.

178
00:16:24,605 --> 00:16:26,189
She talks just fine, Doctor.

179
00:16:26,521 --> 00:16:28,813
We don’t even have answers
for all her questions.

180
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:33,105
At school, they say something is wrong
with her health, and to pull her out.

181
00:16:37,022 --> 00:16:42,105
From what you’ve said, it must be
either dyslexia or dyscalculia.

182
00:17:01,272 --> 00:17:02,022
Kavin!

183
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:05,438
Kavin baby! Wakey wakey.

184
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,397
Let me sleep, Mom!

185
00:17:07,688 --> 00:17:08,772
Wake up, honey.

186
00:17:09,605 --> 00:17:12,105
Let me sleep on holidays...

187
00:17:40,105 --> 00:17:41,647
Smells good!

188
00:17:45,563 --> 00:17:48,022
Dear, brush your teeth before
drinking coffee.

189
00:17:48,064 --> 00:17:50,397
She keeps insulting me.

190
00:18:01,022 --> 00:18:02,897
Mom!
It’s JUST half past three.

191
00:18:03,563 --> 00:18:04,480
Need to shower.

192
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,813
School is off. Let me sleep!
-It's late. Get going.

193
00:18:08,064 --> 00:18:11,314
I’m the Lion King.
I swear on my Jungle, I won’t shower.

194
00:18:16,272 --> 00:18:18,356
Swaying… in the rain!

195
00:18:18,521 --> 00:18:20,397
Kavin...
-Flying in the rain!

196
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,855
Kavin!
-Swaying in the rain!

197
00:18:24,064 --> 00:18:25,772
Come out, quick!

198
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:27,605
Kavin!

199
00:18:48,688 --> 00:18:50,897
Won't you stop dancing?

200
00:18:55,314 --> 00:18:56,897
Stop! I said, stop!

201
00:18:58,356 --> 00:19:00,147
Why did you turn off the T.V?
-Yeah?

202
00:19:00,605 --> 00:19:01,397
Put on your shirt.

203
00:19:01,939 --> 00:19:03,897
Is this any time to eat breakfast?

204
00:19:04,563 --> 00:19:08,480
God knows when you’ll return.
That’s the kind of place you’re headed to.

205
00:19:09,813 --> 00:19:10,605
True.

206
00:19:13,521 --> 00:19:15,022
Where are we going, Mom?

207
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,272
I’ll tell you.

208
00:19:17,397 --> 00:19:19,647
Won’t you stay put?
Always jumping around…

209
00:19:21,272 --> 00:19:22,189
Phew!

210
00:19:23,189 --> 00:19:26,939
I woke up at 3 A.M to cook.
How is the breakfast?

211
00:19:28,563 --> 00:19:29,314
Look, dear.

212
00:19:29,605 --> 00:19:32,147
You keep on cooking.
And I’ll keep eating.

213
00:19:32,563 --> 00:19:36,189
The day your food tastes good,
I will let you know.

214
00:19:39,939 --> 00:19:42,688
How do you like it?
-Superb, Mummy.

215
00:19:42,855 --> 00:19:44,022
See, he likes it!

216
00:19:46,772 --> 00:19:49,605
Daddy, if you say it’s not nice,
she only glares at you.

217
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:53,230
But when I say it, she doesn’t just spank.
She bites!

218
00:19:54,314 --> 00:19:54,855
Fine!

219
00:19:56,563 --> 00:19:58,356
Where are we going?

220
00:19:59,272 --> 00:20:01,897
You get yourself expelled
from every school so easily.

221
00:20:02,272 --> 00:20:04,230
See how hard it is
to get an admission.

222
00:20:10,772 --> 00:20:11,688
Come on!

223
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,314
Hello, Mister.

224
00:20:15,605 --> 00:20:18,980
I got here by 5 A.M.
But you’ve given me token number 1093!

225
00:20:19,022 --> 00:20:21,730
There are people who've been waiting
since yesterday.

226
00:20:22,105 --> 00:20:22,939
Fair enough.

227
00:20:23,563 --> 00:20:27,105
Why should we stand in this queue?
Let’s go to a school with no queue.

228
00:20:27,147 --> 00:20:30,230
No, son.
This is the best school in the area.

229
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:32,980
Even though they charge a lot,
they have great standards.

230
00:20:33,189 --> 00:20:35,688
They’ll make you a first ranker.

231
00:20:35,855 --> 00:20:39,688
Everyone in this queue must be thinking that.
But there can be only one first ranker.

232
00:20:39,813 --> 00:20:40,813
Turn around, boy!

233
00:20:41,064 --> 00:20:43,980
You’ll only believe them.
Not us.

234
00:20:44,314 --> 00:20:45,272
Come on, Daddy!

235
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,897
Hands off!
Sorry, Madam.

236
00:20:50,147 --> 00:20:51,813
Stop fidgeting about, boy.

237
00:20:52,147 --> 00:20:57,855
Back in our days, headmasters would
come home and beg us to send children to schools.

238
00:20:58,314 --> 00:21:04,563
But now, we are paying them money,
standing in queues and begging for admissions.

239
00:21:04,605 --> 00:21:09,939
There was a time when the government ran schools
and liquor stores were owned privately.

240
00:21:10,397 --> 00:21:16,272
But now, the government owns the liquor stores
and schools are run privately.

241
00:21:16,939 --> 00:21:18,064
These are tough times.

242
00:21:20,147 --> 00:21:22,813
It's seven rupees.
-Isn't it five?

243
00:21:22,897 --> 00:21:24,480
Sir, I don't have change.

244
00:21:30,688 --> 00:21:33,022
Dad, why is it so crowded here?

245
00:21:33,189 --> 00:21:34,897
Are they giving out free stuff?

246
00:21:34,939 --> 00:21:37,356
Not giving;
They’re taking stuff away.

247
00:21:37,855 --> 00:21:39,356
Daddy, stop!

248
00:21:39,521 --> 00:21:40,147
What is it?

249
00:21:40,397 --> 00:21:41,397
It’s my teacher.

250
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:42,939
Good morning, Sir!

251
00:21:43,189 --> 00:21:44,563
Good morning. Go.

252
00:21:45,356 --> 00:21:46,230
That’s your teacher?

253
00:21:47,064 --> 00:21:48,064
Yes, Dad.

254
00:21:48,688 --> 00:21:50,272
Hello, Sir? Just a minute.

255
00:21:50,939 --> 00:21:53,189
Hold my spot. I’ll be back.

256
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:54,980
What?

257
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:58,897
You teach at a government school,
but put your children at a private school?

258
00:21:59,022 --> 00:22:01,105
We’re trusting you with our children.

259
00:22:02,064 --> 00:22:04,688
It’s not just me.
That’s just how things are.

260
00:22:04,897 --> 00:22:06,480
If you want, join the queue.

261
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:08,272
But it’s hard to find a spot.

262
00:22:08,939 --> 00:22:12,688
We don’t believe in schools.
We believe in our children.

263
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,314
Good for you.
Carry on.

264
00:22:21,314 --> 00:22:26,356
Our public schools will improve only if their teachers
are barred from enrolling their kids in private schools.

265
00:22:26,438 --> 00:22:29,563
How is that school
different from my school, Dad?

266
00:22:29,605 --> 00:22:34,397
Kids in your school curse in Tamil.
In their school, they curse in English.

267
00:22:34,647 --> 00:22:35,521
That’s all.

268
00:22:36,147 --> 00:22:39,147
Should have stationed a cop here
to manage the crowd.

269
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:41,521
I am a cop, too.
I am here for my son.

270
00:22:41,563 --> 00:22:43,897
God knows what he'll put us through
at the interview tomorrow.

271
00:22:49,355 --> 00:22:51,105
Why has she switched schools every year?

272
00:22:51,146 --> 00:22:53,605
We weren't satisfied with any of the schools.

273
00:22:53,646 --> 00:22:55,980
We heard this was the best school in city.

274
00:22:57,146 --> 00:22:58,855
What is your name?
-Naina

275
00:22:58,938 --> 00:23:00,396
Say something you know.

276
00:23:00,521 --> 00:23:02,605
I know a lot.
What do you want to hear?

277
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:06,230
Rhymes or a story.
Tell me anything.

278
00:23:06,396 --> 00:23:07,980
Rhymes or story?

279
00:23:08,605 --> 00:23:09,980
They're not taking her in.

280
00:23:10,313 --> 00:23:11,230
Tell me a story.

281
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:15,271
A story I read, or one I wrote?

282
00:23:15,646 --> 00:23:17,771
You write stories, too?

283
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:18,688
Why not?

284
00:23:19,188 --> 00:23:21,563
We won't get admissions here
for many generations.

285
00:23:21,855 --> 00:23:23,271
Okay, tell me any story.

286
00:23:23,813 --> 00:23:28,646
The Evil Ravana
abducted Queen Sita to Sri Lanka.

287
00:23:36,021 --> 00:23:40,271
King Rama asked for
The Monkey Lord Hanuman's help.

288
00:23:40,563 --> 00:23:44,146
And Hanuman said, "Okay, I'll come"

289
00:23:45,605 --> 00:23:49,105
I can't tell stories
if the listener doesn't react.

290
00:23:50,396 --> 00:23:51,855
Okay, okay. Next?

291
00:23:52,355 --> 00:23:56,271
Lord Hanuman called his friend Spider Man.

292
00:24:04,521 --> 00:24:06,813
Tell me, bro.
-I need a favour, buddy.

293
00:24:07,063 --> 00:24:07,730
Why?

294
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:13,813
Because there are mountains
and seas between India and Sri Lanka, right?

295
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:18,021
But Spider Man can just shoot his webs
and fly across them!

296
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:23,146
Lord Hanuman can fly, too.

297
00:24:23,188 --> 00:24:24,563
He can…

298
00:24:25,188 --> 00:24:27,605
But he's carrying The Hill of Herbs in his palm.

299
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,563
He can't fly too fast.

300
00:24:31,271 --> 00:24:37,855
Lord Hanuman and Spider Man flew to Sri Lanka
really fast and fought with the Evil Ravana.

301
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:41,938
And they saved Queen Sita!

302
00:24:42,146 --> 00:24:44,688
Sita thanked them.

303
00:24:45,146 --> 00:24:45,730
Why?

304
00:24:45,855 --> 00:24:48,271
One must thank those who help them.

305
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:50,271
Yes. And then?

306
00:24:50,438 --> 00:24:53,271
Hanuman called The Hulk!

307
00:24:53,521 --> 00:24:54,355
Tell me, bro.

308
00:24:56,605 --> 00:24:57,938
Why Hulk?

309
00:24:58,188 --> 00:25:00,521
They flew in easily.

310
00:25:00,855 --> 00:25:03,188
But they need someone to carry Sita back!

311
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:04,813
Hanuman could carry Sita?

312
00:25:04,855 --> 00:25:05,771
He can't.

313
00:25:05,813 --> 00:25:09,980
He's holding The Hill of Herbs with one hand
and Spider Man's web with the other.

314
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,063
Correct.
You may laugh for this.

315
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:19,480
My parents don't laugh at anything I say.
They only get pissed.

316
00:25:21,021 --> 00:25:22,230
That's the end of the story?

317
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:22,980
No, no.

318
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:26,730
On their way back to India,
they met my friend Ranjan.

319
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:29,688
Sita and him had a nice chat.

320
00:25:29,896 --> 00:25:32,313
Why did they meet your friend Ranjan?

321
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,980
This is my story.
I decide who can feature in it.

322
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:42,396
The three of them came to India
and waited at Vadapalani Bus Stop.

323
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,230
Vadapalani Bus Stop? What for?

324
00:25:44,271 --> 00:25:46,605
They lost their way.
So they stopped.

325
00:25:47,063 --> 00:25:49,605
Hulk had an idea.

326
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:51,938
He called Dora.

327
00:25:55,688 --> 00:25:57,105
Dora, where are you?

328
00:25:57,230 --> 00:26:00,355
Hello, Hulk!
How may I help you?

329
00:26:00,396 --> 00:26:01,313
Who is Dora?

330
00:26:01,371 --> 00:26:04,871
This is why
you should spend some time with me.

331
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:07,271
Dora knows her way around.

332
00:26:07,521 --> 00:26:09,855
She has maps and everything.

333
00:26:09,938 --> 00:26:16,646
With Dora's help, they dropped Sita
at Velachery Venus Colony.

334
00:26:16,771 --> 00:26:18,021
That's all.

335
00:26:18,063 --> 00:26:20,480
Why did they drop her at Venus Colony?

336
00:26:20,563 --> 00:26:22,730
Because that's my home.

337
00:26:22,813 --> 00:26:24,480
I am Queen Sita.

338
00:26:28,188 --> 00:26:30,021
We want you at our school, dear.

339
00:26:32,688 --> 00:26:34,980
Good job, Nainu!
Thank you, Ma'am.

340
00:26:35,355 --> 00:26:36,688
Thank you so much.

341
00:26:42,021 --> 00:26:45,105
Don't mock me.
I'm begging you.

342
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:47,646
You're going to 2nd grade.
This is your 4th school.

343
00:26:47,688 --> 00:26:50,188
Your dad had to beg police officers
to get you in.

344
00:26:50,271 --> 00:26:53,646
We have to get your dad transferred
every time we change your school, too.

345
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:54,896
Make me a promise.

346
00:26:55,563 --> 00:26:56,646
What promise?

347
00:26:56,688 --> 00:26:59,396
That you'll study well and score
within the top three ranks.

348
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,980
You shouldn't disobey your teacher.

349
00:27:01,021 --> 00:27:03,605
You won't call your teachers by name,
or speak bad words.

350
00:27:03,688 --> 00:27:05,438
Or hit other children.

351
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:09,146
You won't get up and dance
everytime you hear music.

352
00:27:09,521 --> 00:27:11,105
Promise me all this?
-Okay, Mummy.

353
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:13,105
I will try my level best.
Okay?

354
00:27:13,355 --> 00:27:15,646
Naina honey, be good.
Okay?

355
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:16,938
Go on.

356
00:27:25,188 --> 00:27:28,563
"She is a bad influence on the other kids.
Please, take her away."

357
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:31,646
"Your daughter does this all the time.
She hits and bites!"

358
00:27:31,646 --> 00:27:35,063
"She never listens.
She keeps talking back to her teachers."

359
00:27:35,188 --> 00:27:39,188
"The teachers want to resign..."
"So badly behaved in class..."

360
00:27:39,646 --> 00:27:42,605
"I've never seen such a bad student
in all my years as a teacher."

361
00:27:42,646 --> 00:27:44,355
"We can't handle such a student."

362
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:50,480
"We'll return the fees and the donation you've paid.
Please pull your child out of our school."

363
00:28:02,813 --> 00:28:06,271
Repeat after me.
"I see a rainbow..."

364
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,688
"Across the sky"

365
00:28:12,063 --> 00:28:14,605
Hey! Come and sit in your place.

366
00:28:15,146 --> 00:28:19,021
"I see a rainbow,
across the sky."

367
00:28:20,855 --> 00:28:23,563
Miss, Naina is poking me with a pencil.

368
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:25,563
Get up.
Switch places with her.

369
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:31,188
Okay, students.

370
00:28:31,521 --> 00:28:34,438
Today, we'll learn the names
of our popular leaders.

371
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:38,021
We will match those names
with the given pictures.

372
00:28:38,438 --> 00:28:40,480
Kavin, what are you doing?

373
00:28:47,271 --> 00:28:50,605
Kavin, I expect you to behave yourself
from tomorrow, okay?

374
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:53,563
Show your parents what I had written
in your diary.

375
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,605
Go on.
-Bye! Take care, Miss.

376
00:29:10,063 --> 00:29:12,271
Did you pull a seven and half today?
-No, Mummy.

377
00:29:12,313 --> 00:29:14,730
I kept quiet even when teacher questioned me.

378
00:29:14,771 --> 00:29:18,188
Mummy, does the dog know that it's called "dog"?

379
00:29:18,313 --> 00:29:19,313
Yes, it does.

380
00:29:19,771 --> 00:29:23,521
But it doesn't respond to "dog".
It responds to "joo-joo".

381
00:29:23,646 --> 00:29:25,230
Why don't we call it "joo-joo"?

382
00:29:25,271 --> 00:29:27,021
How were you born in my womb?

383
00:29:27,271 --> 00:29:30,980
Who did you expect then?
A world beauty?

384
00:29:34,188 --> 00:29:35,063
Bye!
-Sir…

385
00:29:35,563 --> 00:29:37,730
You'd borrowed my pen
but never returned it.

386
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:40,980
Sorry!

387
00:29:41,438 --> 00:29:45,021
Sorry, but you borrowed it a few times before.
But never returned it. So...

388
00:29:45,688 --> 00:29:47,813
Fool, where are the pens on my table?

389
00:29:47,938 --> 00:29:51,646
Sir, we buy pens at the office expense.
But it keeps getting stolen.

390
00:29:51,771 --> 00:29:53,980
Hire the Intelligence Bureau to find them.

391
00:29:54,063 --> 00:29:54,688
Fool!

392
00:30:17,396 --> 00:30:18,521
What's happening?

393
00:30:23,396 --> 00:30:24,563
This is strange!

394
00:30:25,396 --> 00:30:27,980
He's started studying
after one day at school?

395
00:30:37,438 --> 00:30:38,271
Paperweight?

396
00:30:38,313 --> 00:30:41,438
They've accidentally put this paperweight in our bag…
-Divya, stop!

397
00:30:44,146 --> 00:30:44,938
This is mine.

398
00:30:45,021 --> 00:30:45,855
Yours?

399
00:30:45,896 --> 00:30:47,480
It was on the billing table.

400
00:30:48,396 --> 00:30:51,188
He billed me. I nicked this.

401
00:30:51,813 --> 00:30:52,730
You stole this?

402
00:30:53,247 --> 00:30:54,396
I didn't steal it!

403
00:30:54,771 --> 00:30:56,480
I was attracted to it.

404
00:30:57,688 --> 00:31:00,896
You gave the beggar 20 rupees.
Could have bought this with the money!

405
00:31:01,771 --> 00:31:05,896
Buying it for money won't be as exciting.
You won't get it.

406
00:31:09,521 --> 00:31:11,771
Get ready, we're going to my friend's place.
-Oh God!

407
00:31:14,146 --> 00:31:15,396
Welcome!
Please come in.

408
00:31:15,438 --> 00:31:16,896
Sit down.
-Happy birthday!

409
00:31:17,271 --> 00:31:18,230
Where's your daughter?

410
00:31:18,771 --> 00:31:19,438
Naina!

411
00:31:20,396 --> 00:31:21,230
Yes, Mom?

412
00:31:22,063 --> 00:31:23,355
Say hello to uncle and aunty.

413
00:31:24,396 --> 00:31:25,646
Look at that!

414
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:39,313
You recite rhymes so well
even though no one told you to.

415
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:42,521
My mum would have
asked me to recite rhymes anyway.

416
00:31:42,771 --> 00:31:45,230
Every time we have guests at home…

417
00:31:45,271 --> 00:31:47,896
They ask me to recite.

418
00:31:48,063 --> 00:31:49,480
Right, Mummy?

419
00:31:51,355 --> 00:31:52,980
Shall I sing next?

420
00:31:53,438 --> 00:31:54,730
Turn on your camera.

421
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:06,021
You must learn to sing like that!

422
00:32:11,355 --> 00:32:12,771
Do you like to sing?

423
00:32:12,813 --> 00:32:14,980
No, my mum likes it.

424
00:32:15,021 --> 00:32:18,688
When she was in school,
she wanted to learn singing, dancing…

425
00:32:18,771 --> 00:32:22,146
And Hindi language.
But these wishes were not fulfilled.

426
00:32:22,313 --> 00:32:25,063
So she's fulfilling the wishes
through me.

427
00:32:25,188 --> 00:32:28,063
Next, she wants me to sing in reality T.V.

428
00:32:28,105 --> 00:32:29,438
Right, Mummy?

429
00:32:30,855 --> 00:32:33,521
Share the video with others through WhatsApp.

430
00:32:38,188 --> 00:32:40,188
Such a good girl.
-Careful with the baby!

431
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:42,688
This is your only chance to be happy.

432
00:32:42,938 --> 00:32:47,021
Once you start school,
you'll have to sing for everyone.

433
00:32:47,271 --> 00:32:48,813
You'll have to dance for everyone.

434
00:32:48,938 --> 00:32:51,396
And score the top three ranks.

435
00:32:51,646 --> 00:32:52,480
Loudmouth!

436
00:32:55,271 --> 00:32:57,605
Another guest?

437
00:32:57,938 --> 00:33:00,271
But I'm so tired!

438
00:33:01,188 --> 00:33:03,271
I guess I'll skip school tomorrow.

439
00:33:13,896 --> 00:33:17,855
Good morning, "Boring" Shylaja!
-Sit down.

440
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,063
Good morning, "Boring" Shylaja!

441
00:33:27,855 --> 00:33:28,563
Silence!

442
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:33,438
Kavin!

443
00:33:33,938 --> 00:33:35,146
Madam, I am sorry.

444
00:33:35,271 --> 00:33:36,605
Very, very sorry.
Please.

445
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:38,938
He speaks curse words,
has bad habits!

446
00:33:40,146 --> 00:33:40,980
Sorry, Ma'am.

447
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:42,271
This won't happen again.

448
00:33:42,855 --> 00:33:45,271
Write that down in a letter
and sign it.

449
00:33:53,188 --> 00:33:54,063
Naina!

450
00:34:06,271 --> 00:34:07,105
Kavin!

451
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,230
Naina!

452
00:34:13,105 --> 00:34:17,521
"Thrown into the dark forest;
With my eyes blindfolded."

453
00:34:18,605 --> 00:34:19,896
Naina, get up.

454
00:34:21,313 --> 00:34:22,021
Sit down.

455
00:34:22,646 --> 00:34:25,980
"Can't I just play Inky Pinky;
And jump here and there?"

456
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,271
Get out!

457
00:34:27,771 --> 00:34:29,021
Phew, I got away.

458
00:34:29,021 --> 00:34:31,646
"Moving to your ding-dong school bell;
Marching to bear beat, are we robots?"

459
00:34:31,688 --> 00:34:34,105
"Run, run.
Run with that spirit."

460
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:36,021
"Dance, dance.
Dance in joy."

461
00:34:36,646 --> 00:34:38,688
"Sing, sing.
Sing your own tunes."

462
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:40,438
I'll tell the teacher!

463
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,105
"Fly with your flock, little birdie!"

464
00:34:42,146 --> 00:34:46,813
"Laugh and play Saa-Boo-Three,
No classes this evening, you are free."

465
00:34:48,355 --> 00:34:50,521
I'm trying a new recipe today.

466
00:34:58,146 --> 00:34:59,730
Silence!
Get out.

467
00:35:02,896 --> 00:35:06,230
Mummy, do water snakes catch cold?

468
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:07,271
Do your homework.

469
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:09,771
See our neighbour Nithin?
Nice kid.

470
00:35:09,896 --> 00:35:11,021
He's such a good student.

471
00:35:11,146 --> 00:35:13,021
And you are so stupid.

472
00:35:13,521 --> 00:35:14,813
But you're so naughty.

473
00:35:15,063 --> 00:35:19,521
Mummy, tell me what you want me to do.
Don't compare me to others, okay?

474
00:35:20,105 --> 00:35:22,355
He's in first grade.
I'm in second grade!

475
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:33,646
Dad, it's Tuesday.
I need my sports uniform.

476
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:35,646
Naina!

477
00:35:39,355 --> 00:35:40,938
I'm going to put you in a hostel!

478
00:35:47,563 --> 00:35:49,480
Should I call you on WhatsApp to eat?

479
00:35:49,855 --> 00:35:51,271
It's late, go to sleep.

480
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:53,105
I'll just finish this game.

481
00:35:53,355 --> 00:35:55,938
Dad, turn on the lights. I'm thirsty.
-Drink this.

482
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:57,688
I want to pee.

483
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:00,021
I feel like pooping.

484
00:36:00,063 --> 00:36:01,480
You brat!

485
00:36:01,521 --> 00:36:04,230
Give me fresh clothes.
This has become wet.

486
00:36:04,438 --> 00:36:06,438
Change him, dear.

487
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:08,438
Why, are you ailing?

488
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:10,355
I won't wear green!

489
00:36:10,438 --> 00:36:13,063
You're wearing blue.
I want to wear blue, too.

490
00:36:13,396 --> 00:36:14,938
Here. Take this!

491
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,271
Stop playing around, dear!

492
00:36:16,271 --> 00:36:17,105
Happy?

493
00:36:17,313 --> 00:36:18,063
Are you happy?

494
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:21,855
Sing for me, I'll fall asleep.

495
00:36:22,813 --> 00:36:23,813
They've got the same voice!

496
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:26,438
First you tired me out.

497
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,146
Now you're making your mother sing
to piss me off?

498
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:31,771
I'll sleep at the Security's quarters.

499
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:36,896
"Don't you stop;
Fly on and on like the wind."

500
00:36:37,105 --> 00:36:38,730
I'm going to put you in a hostel.

501
00:36:38,771 --> 00:36:41,771
"Don't you tire;
Wag away that tail of yours."

502
00:36:41,813 --> 00:36:46,313
"Forget this world;
Go on, hop and swirl!"

503
00:36:46,438 --> 00:36:48,730
You're always searching
for your phone or your wallet.

504
00:36:48,771 --> 00:36:51,688
Do you ever look for your brain?
-You rascal!

505
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:56,146
"Flash that bright smile;
It will annoy them."

506
00:36:56,313 --> 00:36:58,563
"If you hesitate, then
Even Sundays are no fun!"

507
00:36:58,605 --> 00:37:00,105
Naina, don't scribble on the walls!

508
00:37:00,521 --> 00:37:04,813
"These rules are so wrong;
Who's gonna change that now?"

509
00:37:05,396 --> 00:37:07,063
"Go ahead and tickle them!"

510
00:37:07,105 --> 00:37:08,896
Why are you standing out?

511
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:13,688
I'm tired from work.
I can't handle Kavin now.

512
00:37:13,855 --> 00:37:17,063
Call me after he falls asleep?
I'll come then.

513
00:37:17,313 --> 00:37:19,438
I should stay up and suffer alone?

514
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,855
Is this a contest?

515
00:37:21,938 --> 00:37:22,646
Kavin!

516
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:24,146
Mum, get inside this!

517
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:30,313
Hey, listen to the class.
Keep quiet.

518
00:37:30,688 --> 00:37:31,980
My name is Naina.

519
00:37:32,313 --> 00:37:35,438
Stand up.
Won't pay attention? Stupid.

520
00:37:35,688 --> 00:37:38,355
Miss, I did pay attention.

521
00:37:38,605 --> 00:37:42,146
I was listening to what you were saying.
Why should I look at your face?

522
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:45,230
I can't look at the same face for too long.
I get bored.

523
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:52,063
Hey, don't laugh. It will annoy the teacher
and get me thrown out. Okay?

524
00:37:52,605 --> 00:37:53,313
Get out!

525
00:37:53,563 --> 00:37:54,646
Thank you, ma'am.

526
00:38:01,605 --> 00:38:02,855
Excuse me, Miss.

527
00:38:03,521 --> 00:38:05,021
I can't find my pen, Miss.

528
00:38:05,146 --> 00:38:07,771
This is not the first time.
This is the third time.

529
00:38:08,438 --> 00:38:12,063
See, all of you children are from well-off families.

530
00:38:12,271 --> 00:38:15,188
So none of you need to steal from anyone.

531
00:38:15,355 --> 00:38:17,521
It must have fallen into some bag by accident.

532
00:38:17,688 --> 00:38:20,230
Or someone might have just taken it
because it was really pretty.

533
00:38:20,271 --> 00:38:23,730
I don't wish to name the person,
but I know who took it.

534
00:38:24,146 --> 00:38:26,271
So what I'm going to do is...

535
00:38:26,521 --> 00:38:28,188
I'll keep a bag outside.

536
00:38:28,313 --> 00:38:31,688
Everyone should form a line, close your eyes
and put your hand inside the bag.

537
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,646
And whoever took the pen
shall drop it in.

538
00:38:34,063 --> 00:38:36,771
So we'll find the pen;
And no one will know who took it.

539
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:39,688
Okay?
-Okay, Miss!

540
00:38:56,438 --> 00:38:57,313
Wow!

541
00:39:09,105 --> 00:39:11,313
Such a terrible habit!
-Miss, I'm sorry!

542
00:39:11,896 --> 00:39:14,271
Did you show your parents
what I wrote in your diary?

543
00:39:14,313 --> 00:39:16,521
I lost the diary, Miss.

544
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:18,938
How did you lose the diary?

545
00:39:20,188 --> 00:39:20,980
What happened?

546
00:39:21,313 --> 00:39:22,230
What do you mean?

547
00:39:28,021 --> 00:39:28,771
Silence!

548
00:39:33,646 --> 00:39:34,521
Kavin!

549
00:39:37,313 --> 00:39:40,146
Not just that.
He doesn't respect his teachers.

550
00:39:40,313 --> 00:39:41,646
He hit me from behind!

551
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:45,063
I sent her out of class for misbehaving.
She went and rang the bell!

552
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:49,021
I was bored. I wanted to go home.
So I rang the bell.

553
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:51,896
Ask your parents to come tomorrow.

554
00:39:52,063 --> 00:39:53,188
Thank you, Miss.

555
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:56,896
Last warning.
Next time, I'll send you out of the school.

556
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,896
Okay, Ma'am!

557
00:39:59,021 --> 00:39:59,855
Go, now.

558
00:39:59,896 --> 00:40:01,271
Thanks a lot.

559
00:40:07,271 --> 00:40:08,271
What nonsense?

560
00:40:08,313 --> 00:40:11,188
Ask his parents to come.
-He's always like this.

561
00:40:11,313 --> 00:40:12,271
Kavin!
-Madam.

562
00:40:12,313 --> 00:40:13,771
Sorry, Ma'am! Very, very sorry.

563
00:40:14,021 --> 00:40:16,980
No one in my family has the stealing habit.

564
00:40:17,146 --> 00:40:20,063
You look graceful, like
bygone P.M Indira Gandhi. Please!

565
00:40:22,105 --> 00:40:23,438
Kavin, don't touch that!

566
00:40:24,938 --> 00:40:26,313
Always fidgeting!

567
00:40:26,438 --> 00:40:27,688
Don't, Mummy! Please.

568
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:30,313
Look at your father.
He's a bank manager.

569
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,813
He's begging everyone for your sake!

570
00:40:32,896 --> 00:40:35,313
Divya, stop!
-Won't you behave?

571
00:40:35,396 --> 00:40:37,771
How many schools will you change?
-Why are you hitting me?

572
00:40:37,813 --> 00:40:39,146
Won't you obey us?

573
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,855
Are you shameless?

574
00:40:43,063 --> 00:40:43,896
Silence.

575
00:40:43,938 --> 00:40:44,980
Are you mad?

576
00:40:52,063 --> 00:40:54,021
Some children are mischievous,
but they are good students.

577
00:40:54,146 --> 00:40:56,188
Your daughter only does mischief.

578
00:40:57,063 --> 00:40:59,771
I'll wait till her half term exams.
If she does well, we'll see.

579
00:40:59,938 --> 00:41:01,313
Or else, I will expel her.

580
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:27,896
If only he'd always be this quiet.

581
00:41:28,813 --> 00:41:32,063
I hit him so badly,  but those teachers
and principal didn't even budge.

582
00:41:32,313 --> 00:41:34,105
I'm furious at that principal, too.

583
00:41:35,021 --> 00:41:38,896
I wanted to steal something I liked
from her table.

584
00:41:39,855 --> 00:41:41,230
But couldn't.

585
00:41:42,646 --> 00:41:44,313
However…
Divya!

586
00:41:44,313 --> 00:41:45,105
Mom...

587
00:41:45,313 --> 00:41:49,771
I'm sorry, Mom.
I won't do this again!

588
00:41:55,146 --> 00:41:55,771
Dear...

589
00:41:56,730 --> 00:41:58,480
Shall I quit my job?

590
00:41:59,730 --> 00:42:01,896
I'll stay home full time
and take care of him.

591
00:42:06,105 --> 00:42:08,605
Nobody likes me.

592
00:42:09,313 --> 00:42:13,146
Everyone says I'm a naughty boy.

593
00:42:13,646 --> 00:42:16,688
Mum and Dad are hitting me.

594
00:42:17,063 --> 00:42:20,688
My teachers scold me
and punish me.

595
00:42:21,105 --> 00:42:24,271
I really won't do mischief again.

596
00:42:24,688 --> 00:42:27,771
But no one will believe me!

597
00:42:28,021 --> 00:42:29,271
I promise!

598
00:42:35,188 --> 00:42:37,146
You're always home. This is your job.

599
00:42:37,146 --> 00:42:39,021
Can I go to work and manage this, too?

600
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:40,605
Why is she so bad at studies?

601
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:41,813
What do you do at home?

602
00:42:41,855 --> 00:42:44,105
You send the child to school
and sleep all day.

603
00:42:44,313 --> 00:42:45,313
Is this too hard?

604
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:48,063
I'll put her in a hostel if she doesn't
score well in the half term exams.

605
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:50,563
Let's go to a good doctor tomorrow.

606
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:02,313
This is called Dyscalculia.

607
00:43:02,813 --> 00:43:06,313
Need to treat her for at least two months
to arrive at a diagnosis.

608
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:13,855
They just give it some new name,
get us to do X Rays, E.C.Gs and scans…

609
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:16,521
… Just to write "Nil" everywhere
and take our money.

610
00:43:16,563 --> 00:43:18,646
They give us a fright!

611
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:20,230
He's not hyperactive.

612
00:43:20,438 --> 00:43:21,313
He's active.

613
00:43:21,688 --> 00:43:24,855
There's a world of difference between
hyperactive and overactive.

614
00:43:25,063 --> 00:43:26,771
Don't worry.
-Mummy!

615
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:30,605
We had lots of space to play
back home in small towns.

616
00:43:30,938 --> 00:43:32,813
We had trees to climb.

617
00:43:32,938 --> 00:43:34,313
We had wells to swim in.

618
00:43:34,563 --> 00:43:35,063
But now?

619
00:43:35,105 --> 00:43:38,438
We lock them up in 750 square foot space
and complain that they're naughty.

620
00:43:38,438 --> 00:43:39,688
What can he do?

621
00:43:40,188 --> 00:43:42,105
Be grateful that he's active.

622
00:43:42,313 --> 00:43:45,730
This is how kids are at this age.
You were like this, too.

623
00:43:45,896 --> 00:43:47,480
Why does she need counselling?

624
00:43:47,563 --> 00:43:49,688
Medicines will lead to side effects!

625
00:43:49,855 --> 00:43:54,605
They just blame it on the child
when the teachers are lazy.

626
00:43:55,021 --> 00:43:56,271
When is the site visit?

627
00:43:57,146 --> 00:43:59,021
What's up, Vidhya?

628
00:43:59,855 --> 00:44:00,730
Little brat!

629
00:44:03,396 --> 00:44:06,271
Always on the phone,
WhatsApp, Facebook or Twitter.

630
00:44:06,605 --> 00:44:08,480
You coach her for exams from now.

631
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:10,105
No, it's nothing.

632
00:44:10,188 --> 00:44:11,605
I'll just call you back. Bye!

633
00:44:13,396 --> 00:44:14,105
Vidhya!

634
00:44:51,965 --> 00:44:54,298
Please study, Kavin.
Exams are around the corner.

635
00:45:45,298 --> 00:45:47,548
Your son has scored 100 marks.

636
00:45:50,256 --> 00:45:52,506
Thank you!
Superb, boy.

637
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:56,340
We gave him extra coaching…

638
00:45:56,715 --> 00:45:58,923
He's scored 100 marks in total.

639
00:45:58,965 --> 00:45:59,756
E Grade.

640
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:00,548
Oh no!

641
00:46:01,965 --> 00:46:02,715
Sorry, Ma'am.

642
00:46:02,858 --> 00:46:04,108
Very sorry, Ma'am.

643
00:46:04,215 --> 00:46:06,048
Sharp, smart and intelligent.

644
00:46:06,381 --> 00:46:07,215
But her scores?

645
00:46:08,673 --> 00:46:09,465
Really poor.

646
00:46:09,715 --> 00:46:11,590
Why don't you try some international school?

647
00:46:14,715 --> 00:46:18,465
He's only getting worse with time.
There's no improvement.

648
00:46:18,881 --> 00:46:22,173
I think he needs some counselling badly.
And immediately.

649
00:46:23,798 --> 00:46:27,215
Our school is ranked Number 2.
We want to be Number 1.

650
00:46:27,798 --> 00:46:32,131
See a good doctor.
I suspect he might have ADHD.

651
00:46:32,173 --> 00:46:33,340
Ma'am, that's enough.

652
00:46:34,298 --> 00:46:37,631
With every expulsion,
he gets one new illness in each school.

653
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:38,840
We'll leave.

654
00:46:39,173 --> 00:46:41,173
Dad, didn't get the expulsion certificate?

655
00:46:49,215 --> 00:46:49,840
Vidhya!

656
00:46:51,590 --> 00:46:53,048
Vidhya, are you okay?
-Take this.

657
00:47:04,673 --> 00:47:05,631
I just found out.

658
00:47:11,465 --> 00:47:12,465
Let's not do this.

659
00:47:14,802 --> 00:47:16,968
What if it's a boy?
-Doesn't matter.

660
00:47:17,974 --> 00:47:19,307
Can't even handle one.

661
00:47:20,018 --> 00:47:21,809
It'll be a struggle with one more.

662
00:47:22,990 --> 00:47:24,907
We haven't even planned her expenses yet.

663
00:47:30,673 --> 00:47:31,798
I want it, too.

664
00:47:32,465 --> 00:47:33,798
Which school now?

665
00:47:34,006 --> 00:47:35,256
Tambaram Chellamal School.

666
00:47:35,298 --> 00:47:37,673
Need to pay 400 thousand rupees upfront
during admission.

667
00:47:37,756 --> 00:47:40,006
But no extra expenses till she finishes school.

668
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:43,340
They'll return the money upon graduation,
just like house deposit.

669
00:47:43,590 --> 00:47:45,506
Just need to get him in, somehow!

670
00:47:45,631 --> 00:47:46,965
No matter how bratty he is…

671
00:47:47,131 --> 00:47:50,465
They won't expel, because they'd
have to return the money.

672
00:47:50,513 --> 00:47:51,680
What do you say?

673
00:47:53,715 --> 00:47:54,423
Okay.

674
00:47:54,965 --> 00:47:57,090
So we'll find an apartment in that area?

675
00:47:57,192 --> 00:47:57,942
Found one.

676
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:44,131
Each peach, pooch peach.
Choose your best plum.

677
00:48:47,298 --> 00:48:50,423
Each peach pooch plum.
Choose your best plum.

678
00:48:54,756 --> 00:48:56,215
My name is Kavin.

679
00:48:56,631 --> 00:48:58,173
My name is Naina.

680
00:48:58,256 --> 00:49:00,256
Which school?
-Chellamal.

681
00:49:00,381 --> 00:49:02,715
Wow! Me too.

682
00:49:02,798 --> 00:49:03,923
Which class?

683
00:49:04,173 --> 00:49:05,881
3- 'B'
-Superb!

684
00:49:08,298 --> 00:49:10,006
Bye!
-Bye.

685
00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:11,548
You brat!

686
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:13,673
He worries me!

687
00:49:14,006 --> 00:49:15,631
Don't just worry, Divya.

688
00:49:15,798 --> 00:49:18,965
He's crossed 7.5 years of age.
No more troubles.

689
00:49:19,756 --> 00:49:21,590
See? Bell is a good omen.

690
00:49:22,090 --> 00:49:23,548
Careful.
-Tell me, Mom.

691
00:49:23,673 --> 00:49:27,548
I looked into your horoscopes.
This is a good time for you.

692
00:49:30,131 --> 00:49:31,756
Can't hear you.
Please repeat, Mom?

693
00:49:31,881 --> 00:49:35,340
I said, times are very good
for you and your husband.

694
00:49:35,506 --> 00:49:36,756
I told you.

695
00:49:37,423 --> 00:49:39,131
But Kavin…

696
00:49:39,423 --> 00:49:41,590
His seven and a half year curse
 begins tomorrow.

697
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:44,006
The astrologer said to watch out.

698
00:49:46,006 --> 00:49:47,673
What seven and a half year curse, Dad?

699
00:49:48,048 --> 00:49:48,965
That's nothing.

700
00:49:49,590 --> 00:49:54,131
Your parents are going to get whopped
for the next seven and a half years.

701
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:56,256
So I won't get whopped?

702
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:57,673
No.

703
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:01,006
Only you'll get whop-whop-whopped?

704
00:50:01,381 --> 00:50:03,006
Already getting whopped.

705
00:50:03,173 --> 00:50:04,173
Right, Divya?

706
00:50:07,465 --> 00:50:08,173
What?

707
00:50:08,756 --> 00:50:10,506
Feel the good vibes?

708
00:50:11,881 --> 00:50:12,840
Up next…

709
00:50:13,090 --> 00:50:17,715
To kickstart the games for 5 to 6 year olds…

710
00:50:18,090 --> 00:50:23,090
We request Dr. Tamizh Nadan and his wife,
the teacher Vemba, on to the stage.

711
00:50:46,256 --> 00:50:47,673
Welcome!
-Greetings!

712
00:50:47,715 --> 00:50:51,006
I've come here not as a doctor,
but a father. This is not necessary.

713
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:52,715
I'm not here as a teacher, either!

714
00:50:52,756 --> 00:50:54,006
I'm not here as a student, either.

715
00:50:54,131 --> 00:50:56,006
Dad!
-You must inaugurate it.

716
00:50:56,006 --> 00:50:57,256
I'll do it, Dad.

717
00:50:57,256 --> 00:51:00,090
See, your daughter has gone already.
You must do it.

718
00:51:00,173 --> 00:51:00,840
Okay!

719
00:51:02,506 --> 00:51:04,215
All the best.
-All the best.

720
00:51:04,423 --> 00:51:05,006
Ready?

721
00:51:05,173 --> 00:51:07,381
On your marks, get set..
Go!

722
00:51:20,256 --> 00:51:22,006
Come on, Kamakshi!

723
00:51:23,965 --> 00:51:25,256
Super, dear.

724
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:27,381
Oh no. Get up and run.
-Get up and run!

725
00:51:27,465 --> 00:51:29,631
Help her up.
-Durga, get up and run.

726
00:51:29,715 --> 00:51:30,340
Help her up.

727
00:51:30,423 --> 00:51:32,673
Just get up and run.
-Are you hurt, dear?

728
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:35,881
She is embarrassing us.
-How can a fallen child run?

729
00:51:35,965 --> 00:51:37,506
Take care of her.
-Why didn't you run?

730
00:51:37,673 --> 00:51:39,423
Why did you fall?
-Why?

731
00:51:43,506 --> 00:51:44,965
Come on, Kamakshi!
-What are you doing?

732
00:51:45,631 --> 00:51:47,465
Baby, take the bottle and run.

733
00:51:56,298 --> 00:51:57,215
Look at her!

734
00:51:57,423 --> 00:51:59,881
What for?
-She is getting two bottles.

735
00:52:02,298 --> 00:52:03,631
Okay, baby. Come back!

736
00:52:09,256 --> 00:52:12,756
Why did you turn to look at me?
If you'd looked straight, you'd have won.

737
00:52:12,798 --> 00:52:14,006
Such a waste.

738
00:52:14,006 --> 00:52:16,006
You keep running around at home.

739
00:52:16,256 --> 00:52:18,631
But you can't run in a race.
You came third!

740
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:21,090
Superb, Kamatchi.
-Very good, sweetie!

741
00:52:21,131 --> 00:52:25,381
Baby, you ran fast to get the first bottle.
But why did you stop?

742
00:52:25,881 --> 00:52:30,965
There were many bottles, Daddy.
But I wanted a pink bottle.

743
00:52:31,298 --> 00:52:35,590
But there was a blue bottle in your track.
-You could have taken it.

744
00:52:35,615 --> 00:52:39,282
But my favourite colour is pink.
So I waited and searched for it.

745
00:52:39,506 --> 00:52:41,506
Then why did you go back
for the blue one?

746
00:52:41,548 --> 00:52:44,340
Because brother would like it.
Here, brother.

747
00:52:45,715 --> 00:52:47,923
How sweet!
-You're such a darling.

748
00:52:47,965 --> 00:52:48,840
My darling!

749
00:52:49,215 --> 00:52:49,881
Come here.

750
00:52:50,673 --> 00:52:53,090
Superb, sweetie. You ran really well.
-Look at her!

751
00:52:53,173 --> 00:52:55,340
She took what she wanted;
Not what she found.

752
00:52:55,631 --> 00:52:57,340
Win or lose, she did what she wanted.

753
00:52:57,631 --> 00:52:59,465
It's what I love about my Kamakshi.

754
00:52:59,673 --> 00:53:02,006
I wouldn't have been this happy
even if you'd finished first.

755
00:53:02,215 --> 00:53:05,340
You brought what you liked.
That's your individuality.

756
00:53:05,388 --> 00:53:06,180
Wow!

757
00:53:06,423 --> 00:53:09,756
"Our Tamizh Nadan ignored the jibes…"

758
00:53:10,298 --> 00:53:14,434
"He preserved his self respect
by running till the end."

759
00:53:14,715 --> 00:53:19,090
"He will go places in his life."

760
00:53:19,756 --> 00:53:21,881
We have admissions in our school tomorrow.

761
00:53:23,423 --> 00:53:26,798
Greetings to all you parents.

762
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:30,881
To tell you about
our school's admission procedure…

763
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:34,756
Over to our Special Educator Miss Vemba.

764
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:38,756
Greetings to everyone.

765
00:53:39,381 --> 00:53:43,006
We all have aspirations for our children.

766
00:53:43,756 --> 00:53:48,173
Those of you who wish their children to be
doctors, lawyers, engineers or collectors…

767
00:53:48,215 --> 00:53:49,506
Please raise your hand?

768
00:53:52,006 --> 00:53:55,006
I want my son to become an aeronautical engineer.
Does it count?

769
00:53:55,048 --> 00:53:56,340
Of course.

770
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:57,590
Thank you.

771
00:53:58,548 --> 00:54:00,423
Firstly, my best wishes to all of you.

772
00:54:00,756 --> 00:54:03,923
For mapping your child's future
while they are just three.

773
00:54:04,381 --> 00:54:07,673
Unfortunately, this school is not
right for you.

774
00:54:08,006 --> 00:54:09,006
I'm very sorry.

775
00:54:09,506 --> 00:54:11,423
There are many schools for you
out there.

776
00:54:12,215 --> 00:54:13,173
You may leave.

777
00:54:15,715 --> 00:54:17,756
Those who didn't raise their hands,
please come forward.

778
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:19,756
Please.

779
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:25,006
Let's just hear her out.
-Why is she talking that way?

780
00:54:25,090 --> 00:54:27,923
We hold our kid's hands
and walk before them.

781
00:54:28,090 --> 00:54:29,340
They walk behind us.

782
00:54:29,590 --> 00:54:32,006
How can we monitor their activities then?

783
00:54:32,381 --> 00:54:36,256
Our school's concept is,
we let the kids walk and follow them.

784
00:54:36,631 --> 00:54:40,673
That is, we don't ask our children
to come into our world.

785
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:42,590
We enter theirs.

786
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:49,715
We watch each child individually,
spot their interests and work on it.

787
00:54:49,881 --> 00:54:52,173
Our school doesn't have a syllabus
for the first five years.

788
00:54:52,256 --> 00:54:54,131
They needn't bring books.

789
00:54:55,756 --> 00:54:59,340
No homework. No school uniform.
No holiday assignments, either.

790
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:03,590
We don't believe in homework.
We believe in teamwork.

791
00:55:03,798 --> 00:55:07,173
Our children pursue life.
And in doing so, pursue knowledge.

792
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:10,548
If this interests you,
get these application form.

793
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:12,631
Why spend on a school like this?

794
00:55:12,673 --> 00:55:14,631
They're playing with our kids' futures
trying to be different.

795
00:55:14,673 --> 00:55:16,131
How will they support themselves?

796
00:55:16,881 --> 00:55:17,881
Let's get out of here.

797
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:22,965
Stone, paper, scissors!

798
00:55:23,048 --> 00:55:25,006
No playing here.
Go to the playground!

799
00:55:25,006 --> 00:55:25,590
Go away!

800
00:55:25,631 --> 00:55:27,631
I need discipline, manners.
Perfection.

801
00:55:27,656 --> 00:55:28,490
Perfection!

802
00:55:28,603 --> 00:55:29,270
Crazy.

803
00:55:30,167 --> 00:55:32,750
That secretary lady insulted us.

804
00:55:33,265 --> 00:55:36,140
And some weeny kid bumped into us
but didn't apologise.

805
00:55:36,482 --> 00:55:38,065
We'll show them.

806
00:55:38,176 --> 00:55:38,842
How?

807
00:55:38,933 --> 00:55:41,766
There's a power cut.
It won't be back for another hour.

808
00:55:58,974 --> 00:56:00,849
No water.
Get them to turn the motor on?

809
00:56:00,874 --> 00:56:01,583
Vidhya!

810
00:56:02,196 --> 00:56:06,405
He only showers on Sundays.
No water even today? Poor thing.

811
00:56:06,465 --> 00:56:09,256
I only shower on Sundays, huh?

812
00:56:10,401 --> 00:56:12,651
I will shower,
even if there's no water.

813
00:56:14,153 --> 00:56:16,569
Baby, I'm disguised as a Courier Man.

814
00:56:17,488 --> 00:56:18,738
Are you home alone?

815
00:56:18,911 --> 00:56:22,494
You can come disguised as anything.
There's no one here.

816
00:56:23,023 --> 00:56:24,023
Don't worry.

817
00:56:24,135 --> 00:56:26,760
The timing couldn't be better.

818
00:56:26,917 --> 00:56:28,292
Really? I'm coming.

819
00:56:28,631 --> 00:56:30,548
You'll be okay, Dad.

820
00:56:31,351 --> 00:56:32,310
Mum!

821
00:56:56,567 --> 00:56:58,442
Somebody is watching us.
-Really?

822
00:56:58,467 --> 00:57:00,426
Stop ringing the bell!
I'm coming.

823
00:57:00,451 --> 00:57:04,909
Can't even go to the bathroom in peace.
They won't stop ringing the bell!

824
00:57:05,851 --> 00:57:06,685
Where is Naina?

825
00:57:06,950 --> 00:57:09,158
Oh no! He's started again.

826
00:57:09,183 --> 00:57:09,933
Kavin!

827
00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:12,238
SECURITY!

828
00:57:15,156 --> 00:57:16,698
I'm coming.

829
00:57:18,781 --> 00:57:20,656
It was him!
He rang the bell.

830
00:57:20,698 --> 00:57:21,865
Get him!

831
00:57:22,990 --> 00:57:24,448
You said no one was here.

832
00:57:24,531 --> 00:57:25,990
Everyone's out looking at me.

833
00:57:26,031 --> 00:57:27,156
Are you kidding me?

834
00:57:27,365 --> 00:57:29,698
Sir! I swear on my mom,
it wasn't me.

835
00:57:31,073 --> 00:57:31,906
I'm coming.

836
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:35,990
Who are you?
Buzzing the bell like a mad man.

837
00:57:36,031 --> 00:57:38,281
Watch your manners.
I'm your next door neighbour.

838
00:57:38,448 --> 00:57:39,281
You live here?

839
00:57:39,365 --> 00:57:41,698
I've lived here for 3 years.
Never seen you before.

840
00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:43,990
I've lived here for 5 years, too.
I haven't seen you either.

841
00:57:44,031 --> 00:57:46,781
You haven't seen me before?
-You haven't?

842
00:57:46,906 --> 00:57:48,948
No, sir.
Haven't seen you in all this time.

843
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:50,531
Darn.

844
00:57:50,865 --> 00:57:53,490
Nice to meet you, sir.
-Nice meeting you.

845
00:57:53,865 --> 00:57:57,198
Father-in-law! What's wrong?
Dear, come here!

846
00:57:57,365 --> 00:57:59,990
Is this the time to shake hands?
Your dad is breathing his last.

847
00:58:00,031 --> 00:58:01,281
Come on.
-Dad!

848
00:58:02,073 --> 00:58:04,240
Catch him!
-Stop.

849
00:58:27,031 --> 00:58:28,115
Nasty fellows.

850
00:58:28,823 --> 00:58:31,573
Missed it.
-I'll go next. Okay?

851
00:58:46,531 --> 00:58:48,115
Someone rings the bell,
and you call me?

852
00:58:48,156 --> 00:58:49,865
I'm the Apartment Secretary
not the security.

853
00:58:58,531 --> 00:58:59,781
Hi, Auntie!

854
00:59:02,156 --> 00:59:03,406
What's that?

855
00:59:10,115 --> 00:59:11,490
It fell on her mouth!

856
00:59:13,490 --> 00:59:14,740
Superb!

857
00:59:15,823 --> 00:59:17,615
Secretary!

858
00:59:18,406 --> 00:59:19,448
That's you.

859
00:59:19,740 --> 00:59:20,990
Security!

860
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:21,823
That'd be me.

861
00:59:21,865 --> 00:59:24,406
Bring me those brats,
wherever they are. Go!

862
00:59:25,615 --> 00:59:26,490
So cool!

863
00:59:36,531 --> 00:59:37,156
What?

864
00:59:37,406 --> 00:59:39,156
No air in your car tyres?

865
00:59:40,656 --> 00:59:42,406
Do I look like an air pump man?

866
00:59:48,031 --> 00:59:49,656
Darn. She got away.

867
00:59:50,531 --> 00:59:51,656
Oh no!

868
01:00:01,198 --> 01:00:03,948
What's happening here?
-First it was water, next sand.

869
01:00:03,948 --> 01:00:05,240
Maybe they'll bury you next?

870
01:00:08,365 --> 01:00:09,615
They've done it?

871
01:00:10,573 --> 01:00:12,490
What's that?
-Ambulance.

872
01:00:15,490 --> 01:00:16,156
Careful.

873
01:00:16,406 --> 01:00:17,781
Careful.
-What happened?

874
01:00:17,823 --> 01:00:21,031
Secretary, if anything should happen to my dad,
you'll answer to me.

875
01:00:21,073 --> 01:00:23,323
What nonsense?
How is it the Secretary's fault?

876
01:00:23,365 --> 01:00:24,323
What can I do?

877
01:00:30,865 --> 01:00:33,115
Madam, let's call for an emergency meeting.

878
01:00:33,156 --> 01:00:33,990
You freshen up first.

879
01:00:34,073 --> 01:00:36,198
Yes, bring me those brats.

880
01:00:37,406 --> 01:00:40,031
How can a Secretary handle everything?

881
01:00:40,448 --> 01:00:41,406
And you people...

882
01:00:41,740 --> 01:00:45,656
If you wish to live in apartments,
must you not look after your kids?

883
01:00:46,323 --> 01:00:48,448
They should be disciplined
and well behaved.

884
01:00:48,615 --> 01:00:51,490
And you know very well.
I want discipline and decency.

885
01:00:51,751 --> 01:00:52,626
Perfection!

886
01:00:55,198 --> 01:00:58,406
Oh no.
Looks like Oldie's dead.

887
01:01:09,281 --> 01:01:10,240
I'll spank you!

888
01:01:10,323 --> 01:01:11,240
What's going on here?

889
01:01:17,906 --> 01:01:20,031
Look how they behave right before us?

890
01:01:20,073 --> 01:01:21,406
What are you doing?

891
01:01:21,448 --> 01:01:23,240
Control your children!

892
01:01:25,211 --> 01:01:25,919
Kavin!

893
01:01:39,758 --> 01:01:40,300
What?

894
01:01:58,323 --> 01:02:00,656
They should be put in a hostel.
-Okay, please.

895
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:02,076
Please, everyone.

896
01:02:02,321 --> 01:02:03,654
You need not worry.

897
01:02:04,476 --> 01:02:05,584
I'll put my daughter...

898
01:02:07,162 --> 01:02:08,120
In a hostel.

899
01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:10,132
What?
-Mom, please don't.

900
01:02:10,365 --> 01:02:12,031
Good riddance! Do that!

901
01:02:12,056 --> 01:02:12,931
Please!

902
01:02:12,956 --> 01:02:13,872
Please?

903
01:02:13,948 --> 01:02:16,198
Yes, we'll put our son in a hostel.

904
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:19,365
Mommy, no!
Tell Daddy not to.

905
01:02:20,829 --> 01:02:22,162
Akhil, what's all this?
-Excuse me!

906
01:02:23,115 --> 01:02:25,656
I am Tamizh. A doctor.

907
01:02:26,031 --> 01:02:27,865
Hi, I'm Dr. Tamizh Nadan.
-Hello.

908
01:02:28,235 --> 01:02:29,152
I saw everything.

909
01:02:29,267 --> 01:02:30,892
I don't think they need a hostel.

910
01:02:30,959 --> 01:02:32,168
I'm a child psychiatrist.

911
01:02:32,448 --> 01:02:34,198
This is my clinic's address.

912
01:02:34,406 --> 01:02:35,989
Why don't you drop in?
We'll talk.

913
01:02:36,865 --> 01:02:39,156
Sir, call me anytime.

914
01:02:39,826 --> 01:02:40,368
Come.

915
01:02:40,473 --> 01:02:43,764
Kids are naughty sometimes.
But we can't…

916
01:02:44,737 --> 01:02:45,654
He threw it away.

917
01:02:46,803 --> 01:02:48,636
He must have hit the peak of sadness.

918
01:03:00,198 --> 01:03:02,281
Dad!

919
01:03:02,365 --> 01:03:05,823
Mommy, don't go.
Take me with you.

920
01:03:05,906 --> 01:03:09,281
I won't do mischief. Please!

921
01:03:09,365 --> 01:03:11,656
You'll like it here. Wait for a few days.
-No!

922
01:03:12,990 --> 01:03:16,154
Don't cry, baby.
I'll call you everyday.

923
01:03:16,281 --> 01:03:18,865
I'll visit on weekends.
Okay?

924
01:03:19,005 --> 01:03:22,005
You shouldn't cry.
-Get going, time is up.

925
01:03:22,031 --> 01:03:25,156
Don't cry…
-Dad, take me with you!

926
01:03:25,323 --> 01:03:27,531
Dad!
-Okay, let's go.

927
01:03:30,156 --> 01:03:32,990
Dad, take me with you.

928
01:03:44,652 --> 01:03:46,611
Dad! Take me with you.

929
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:17,994
Divya…

930
01:04:18,615 --> 01:04:20,782
Set the air-conditioner at 20.

931
01:04:21,020 --> 01:04:22,562
Or even 18.

932
01:04:25,104 --> 01:04:28,979
After a long, long time.
I shall sleep peacefully tonight.

933
01:04:29,538 --> 01:04:31,455
Thank you, God!
Thank you.

934
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:33,050
Go to sleep.

935
01:04:59,354 --> 01:05:00,020
What's wrong?

936
01:05:02,229 --> 01:05:05,395
Had Naina been here…
She would not have let us watch T.V.

937
01:05:27,020 --> 01:05:28,937
It's hard to handle her mischief.

938
01:05:29,312 --> 01:05:31,562
And it's hard without her mischief, too!

939
01:05:33,562 --> 01:05:35,479
My baby must be suffering there.

940
01:05:36,354 --> 01:05:37,437
Just wait for a week.

941
01:05:38,312 --> 01:05:39,729
We'll visit him this Sunday.

942
01:05:56,354 --> 01:05:57,854
Alright. He'll be fine.

943
01:05:59,812 --> 01:06:00,562
Hi, Nithin!

944
01:06:01,145 --> 01:06:01,979
Mr. Nithin?

945
01:06:03,354 --> 01:06:04,020
What's up?

946
01:06:04,045 --> 01:06:06,337
That's a nice shirt.
So stylish.

947
01:06:09,229 --> 01:06:11,312
A chocolate for Nithin.
Yeah?

948
01:06:12,770 --> 01:06:14,020
Don't want it, Uncle.

949
01:06:14,645 --> 01:06:16,979
They say I'll get cavities.

950
01:06:17,312 --> 01:06:17,895
Okay.

951
01:06:19,395 --> 01:06:21,854
Ninja Hattori!
Can Nithin have ice-creams, please?

952
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:23,020
No, Uncle.

953
01:06:23,604 --> 01:06:25,479
They say I'll get cold.

954
01:06:26,354 --> 01:06:28,562
Fine, then.
Some milk shakes or cold drinks?

955
01:06:28,937 --> 01:06:30,187
Which flavour?
-No, Uncle.

956
01:06:30,479 --> 01:06:32,229
They say I'll get fever.

957
01:06:33,479 --> 01:06:34,895
Don't you buy him anything?

958
01:06:34,979 --> 01:06:37,104
Doctor. We think he has
health problems.

959
01:06:37,597 --> 01:06:39,472
The real problem is when a child
has no problems.

960
01:06:39,812 --> 01:06:41,354
A child is meant to have some problems.

961
01:06:42,395 --> 01:06:43,812
What do you think is wrong with Nithin?

962
01:06:43,854 --> 01:06:46,187
Doctor, I see so many kids in the apartment.

963
01:06:46,229 --> 01:06:49,187
They're all so smart, chirpy and active.

964
01:06:49,364 --> 01:06:52,641
But he's always so dull and withdrawn.

965
01:06:52,937 --> 01:06:56,104
Why do you say he's dull?
You could say he's calm.

966
01:06:57,354 --> 01:07:01,479
Only if we treat kids like kids,
will they respect their adults as adults.

967
01:07:02,270 --> 01:07:03,562
Mom and dad are totally wrong.

968
01:07:03,854 --> 01:07:06,104
Say sorry to Nithin.
Both of you!

969
01:07:06,395 --> 01:07:07,187
Like friends.

970
01:07:07,437 --> 01:07:08,645
Sorry, Nithin.
-Sorry, Nithin.

971
01:07:09,095 --> 01:07:10,118
Happy?
-Yes.

972
01:07:10,729 --> 01:07:11,645
Super happy?

973
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:18,482
Do you like Finding Nemo?
Your favourite character?

974
01:07:18,770 --> 01:07:20,270
Yes, I like.
-Dory or Merlin?

975
01:07:33,687 --> 01:07:35,104
Okay, what's this?

976
01:07:46,229 --> 01:07:47,687
What's this?
-A frog?

977
01:07:49,395 --> 01:07:50,395
Good catch!

978
01:07:55,187 --> 01:07:56,854
Green... Red...

979
01:07:58,229 --> 01:07:59,395
Yellow.
-Wow!

980
01:07:59,437 --> 01:08:00,729
You got all the colours right.

981
01:08:00,812 --> 01:08:01,854
Give me a five!

982
01:08:04,937 --> 01:08:07,604
I must give Nithin something.
Who said you were dull?

983
01:08:10,062 --> 01:08:10,937
You like it?
-Yeah!

984
01:08:14,812 --> 01:08:15,520
Here.

985
01:08:15,604 --> 01:08:17,020
Hey! Wow.

986
01:08:17,562 --> 01:08:18,895
You made that?
-Yes.

987
01:08:19,187 --> 01:08:20,145
He makes these?

988
01:08:20,270 --> 01:08:21,687
Yeah, he does that.
-We didn't know.

989
01:08:22,479 --> 01:08:23,104
Wow.

990
01:08:23,669 --> 01:08:24,877
Damn good.
-Thanks.

991
01:08:25,020 --> 01:08:25,812
Chalk art.

992
01:08:26,438 --> 01:08:27,397
I'll keep it right here.

993
01:08:28,218 --> 01:08:29,968
Was Nithin born in a normal delivery?

994
01:08:29,993 --> 01:08:31,409
No, a caesarian.

995
01:08:33,334 --> 01:08:35,917
He's a brilliant kid.
You don't have to worry about him.

996
01:08:40,219 --> 01:08:41,802
Sir, what's your name?
-Chandru.

997
01:08:41,827 --> 01:08:43,036
Chandru! Okay.

998
01:08:43,292 --> 01:08:44,334
What do you do with this?

999
01:08:51,645 --> 01:08:52,479
Okay, one more...

1000
01:08:58,270 --> 01:09:00,770
You seem like a good boy.
-I'm not a good boy.

1001
01:09:00,937 --> 01:09:01,812
I'm a bad boy.

1002
01:09:01,937 --> 01:09:03,104
Give me an injection
if you want.

1003
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:32,770
I don't have any injections.

1004
01:09:34,023 --> 01:09:35,482
Tell me, what does he do?

1005
01:09:36,016 --> 01:09:40,182
Two T.Vs, four remote controls,
three cell phones, eight tube lights…

1006
01:09:40,207 --> 01:09:41,165
He broke them all!

1007
01:09:41,190 --> 01:09:42,065
Not just that.

1008
01:09:42,315 --> 01:09:46,274
He beat up the neighbour's kids
so many times!

1009
01:09:46,607 --> 01:09:49,399
And he swears a lot, Doctor.
-Yeah!

1010
01:09:49,646 --> 01:09:52,854
Children don't swear.
They only repeat what they hear.

1011
01:09:53,270 --> 01:09:55,520
You must swear a lot while driving the auto?

1012
01:09:55,770 --> 01:09:58,729
He may have heard you say a word or
two at home, and just repeated you.

1013
01:09:59,312 --> 01:10:01,562
Children always imitate their parents.

1014
01:10:02,285 --> 01:10:05,868
The environment is their best treatment.

1015
01:10:06,863 --> 01:10:10,072
Wake up!
-It's time, wake up!

1016
01:10:12,395 --> 01:10:20,395
"These flowers were in bloom;
Who cast them to doom?"

1017
01:10:24,729 --> 01:10:32,520
"Their smiles brighter than the sun;
Who said that it's all done?"

1018
01:10:32,562 --> 01:10:39,979
"They've been uprooted,
Their garden polluted!"

1019
01:10:40,104 --> 01:10:44,604
"How could they be fragrant?"

1020
01:10:45,270 --> 01:10:53,104
"A flower speaks with colours;
Why would you take that away?"

1021
01:10:53,479 --> 01:11:01,020
"Is the inside of a glass jar
Any place for a little flower?"

1022
01:11:01,437 --> 01:11:08,645
"They've been displaced,
Thrown into strange space!"

1023
01:11:08,937 --> 01:11:13,687
"How could they find their way?"

1024
01:11:25,437 --> 01:11:28,187
Everybody, inside!
Inside. Now.

1025
01:11:29,854 --> 01:11:37,979
"Gone are your shrieks of laughter;
This dead silence is torture."

1026
01:11:38,145 --> 01:11:46,229
"The ground where you played;
It looks so desolate today."

1027
01:11:46,312 --> 01:11:54,020
"Your Mommy's home.
So is your Daddy."

1028
01:11:54,645 --> 01:12:02,395
"Then why are you the orphan here?"

1029
01:12:03,104 --> 01:12:10,104
"They've been shunned;
Their laughter silenced."

1030
01:12:10,604 --> 01:12:15,645
"How could they be happy?"

1031
01:13:26,062 --> 01:13:26,812
Study!

1032
01:13:28,729 --> 01:13:30,729
a, A

1033
01:13:31,312 --> 01:13:33,312
b, B

1034
01:13:33,437 --> 01:13:35,562
c, C

1035
01:13:36,062 --> 01:13:38,062
Read your books!

1036
01:13:45,354 --> 01:13:46,437
If you keep troubling me…

1037
01:13:46,479 --> 01:13:49,270
I'll put you in a hostel,
just like that Uncle did to his daughter.

1038
01:13:57,312 --> 01:14:00,104
Six thousand two hundred and thirty one.

1039
01:14:00,395 --> 01:14:04,395
When we split them,
we have six 1000s, two 100s…

1040
01:14:04,562 --> 01:14:05,312
Kavin!

1041
01:14:06,645 --> 01:14:07,437
Come here.

1042
01:14:08,937 --> 01:14:10,729
Oh no!
-Solve this.

1043
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:29,312
Silence!

1044
01:14:31,937 --> 01:14:33,604
Kavin, what's your problem?

1045
01:14:35,145 --> 01:14:36,937
I'll be there…
-Excuse me, sir.

1046
01:14:36,979 --> 01:14:38,604
Yes?
-We need to talk.

1047
01:14:38,604 --> 01:14:40,937
We've settled the payment.
Looking for a tip...?

1048
01:14:41,062 --> 01:14:42,729
No such thing, Sir!

1049
01:14:43,145 --> 01:14:45,604
Do you like our hotel's services?

1050
01:14:45,854 --> 01:14:46,604
Very nice!

1051
01:14:46,729 --> 01:14:49,562
That's why we host all our
end of the year meetings here.

1052
01:14:49,604 --> 01:14:51,645
Please don't misunderstand my saying...

1053
01:14:53,437 --> 01:14:54,020
Tell me.

1054
01:14:54,187 --> 01:14:56,854
There's a silver spoon
in your trouser pocket.

1055
01:14:58,104 --> 01:15:00,395
If you wish to,
you can keep that as our gift.

1056
01:15:00,631 --> 01:15:01,214
Me?

1057
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:02,812
What nonsense?

1058
01:15:03,437 --> 01:15:04,312
My pocket?

1059
01:15:04,395 --> 01:15:05,229
My family..!

1060
01:15:05,645 --> 01:15:07,645
No one in my family has a stealing habit.

1061
01:15:08,062 --> 01:15:09,854
No, Sir.
It is there, just check.

1062
01:15:19,104 --> 01:15:22,520
Some friend must have playfully…
You rascal!

1063
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:24,895
He's naughty!

1064
01:15:26,479 --> 01:15:27,770
He must have put it there.

1065
01:15:27,895 --> 01:15:29,479
I'll deal with this later.
-Sorry, Sir.

1066
01:15:29,770 --> 01:15:31,437
Doesn't appear that way.

1067
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:35,145
You slipped it in your pant pocket…
I'm not saying that!

1068
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:37,437
Our CCTV camera footage says so.

1069
01:15:37,562 --> 01:15:38,229
Sorry, Sir.

1070
01:15:38,312 --> 01:15:39,145
Very, very sorry.

1071
01:15:39,312 --> 01:15:41,687
My wife would have really liked
this silver spoon.

1072
01:15:42,312 --> 01:15:44,854
I will pay for this..
-Not at all!

1073
01:15:45,229 --> 01:15:47,020
To us, our customer is the priority.

1074
01:15:47,229 --> 01:15:49,229
This is not the first time.
It's your third time.

1075
01:15:49,729 --> 01:15:52,020
First you took a silver goblet.

1076
01:15:52,729 --> 01:15:54,645
Next, it was a bowl.

1077
01:15:55,020 --> 01:15:57,437
So the management wanted me to
talk to you.

1078
01:15:57,770 --> 01:15:59,020
Don't mistake me, sir.

1079
01:16:00,187 --> 01:16:04,604
It's okay. But I'll pay for it…
-Sorry, Sir. We won't accept it.

1080
01:16:04,895 --> 01:16:05,604
Thank you.

1081
01:16:06,854 --> 01:16:07,729
Oh shucks!

1082
01:16:16,687 --> 01:16:17,937
Such a terrible habit!

1083
01:16:18,437 --> 01:16:20,312
You're a father!
You should know better.

1084
01:16:20,979 --> 01:16:22,604
You stole my purse?

1085
01:16:23,187 --> 01:16:25,479
He cried so bad when this watch
went missing!

1086
01:16:26,270 --> 01:16:28,729
And you talk about your lineage.
-Divya!

1087
01:16:30,020 --> 01:16:31,520
I feel so guilty.

1088
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:34,437
I just can't be normal.

1089
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:35,437
Sorry, Divya.

1090
01:16:36,187 --> 01:16:38,854
Fine. We'll go see a doctor.
-Then give me that!

1091
01:16:45,104 --> 01:16:47,270
There's a thief in my house?

1092
01:16:48,062 --> 01:16:48,770
Oh god!

1093
01:16:50,729 --> 01:16:52,437
Greetings. Who's calling?

1094
01:16:52,479 --> 01:16:54,312
May I speak to Tamizh Nadan?
-Sir!

1095
01:16:54,645 --> 01:16:56,062
Caught me on the landline?

1096
01:16:56,270 --> 01:16:58,104
Can you give me an appointment for the evening?

1097
01:16:58,145 --> 01:17:01,020
Sir, it's a Sunday.
Family time.

1098
01:17:02,312 --> 01:17:04,187
We're all going to visit a friend.

1099
01:17:04,979 --> 01:17:07,104
Let's meet tomorrow?
Post lunch?

1100
01:17:07,270 --> 01:17:08,270
Yeah, sure.

1101
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:09,020
Done.

1102
01:17:09,145 --> 01:17:09,812
Honey?

1103
01:17:10,145 --> 01:17:13,229
What do you call one who doesn't listen up?

1104
01:17:13,437 --> 01:17:18,229
Good Lord. Please…
Leave me alone!

1105
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:20,354
This happens every Sunday...
-Dad-in-law!

1106
01:17:20,437 --> 01:17:24,479
"Those who don't listen up
are mockingly called this…"

1107
01:17:24,687 --> 01:17:25,479
What word is it?

1108
01:17:25,562 --> 01:17:27,854
Obviously, it's "Dumb-a-rumb".

1109
01:17:28,104 --> 01:17:28,979
Yes!

1110
01:17:29,187 --> 01:17:31,520
I knew that.

1111
01:17:32,229 --> 01:17:33,270
Dude.

1112
01:17:33,604 --> 01:17:34,604
What's special for lunch?

1113
01:17:35,729 --> 01:17:38,979
But Vemba doesn't like mutton.
Make fish fry instead!

1114
01:17:39,312 --> 01:17:41,937
Make the fish gravy tangy.
Add some country garlic, too.

1115
01:17:42,312 --> 01:17:44,187
Lots of pepper in the soup.

1116
01:17:44,812 --> 01:17:46,187
And no yoghurts.

1117
01:17:46,354 --> 01:17:50,479
Add some ginger, chillies, curry leaves,
coriander, mustard seeds to butter milk.

1118
01:17:50,604 --> 01:17:52,312
We're just starting in five minutes.

1119
01:17:52,437 --> 01:17:54,895
Chilled betel leaf after-meal for all.

1120
01:17:55,104 --> 01:17:56,395
Okay? Right, dude!

1121
01:17:56,562 --> 01:17:57,604
Done, buh bye.

1122
01:17:57,687 --> 01:18:01,604
We're going for a feast.
Is it polite to give a food list?

1123
01:18:01,812 --> 01:18:04,895
Why not? We're the guests.
But they'll cook their favourite food.

1124
01:18:05,020 --> 01:18:06,645
When do I get to eat my
favourite foods?

1125
01:18:08,937 --> 01:18:11,395
Why don't you like me, Mom?

1126
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:14,687
But I like you a lot, Mom.

1127
01:18:15,020 --> 01:18:16,354
Who said I don't like you?

1128
01:18:16,604 --> 01:18:17,812
I like you a lot.

1129
01:18:18,145 --> 01:18:22,187
Then why did you put me
in this hostel, Mom?

1130
01:18:25,229 --> 01:18:29,020
I'm sorry for troubling you, Dad.

1131
01:18:29,395 --> 01:18:31,729
But I didn't mean to.

1132
01:18:31,895 --> 01:18:34,979
Please, Mom.
Take me home!

1133
01:18:35,270 --> 01:18:36,562
Please, Mom!

1134
01:18:36,979 --> 01:18:41,520
While showering today,
soap got into my eyes.

1135
01:18:41,729 --> 01:18:45,354
My eyes burnt
and I kept crying and crying.

1136
01:18:45,645 --> 01:18:48,437
No one even noticed.

1137
01:18:48,604 --> 01:18:51,562
Who'll give me Kellogg's breakfast now?

1138
01:18:51,729 --> 01:18:54,562
They give me rice-cakes hard as stone here.

1139
01:18:54,687 --> 01:18:57,020
I even threw up yesterday.

1140
01:18:57,145 --> 01:19:00,937
The janitor kept scolding me
while cleaning it up.

1141
01:19:00,979 --> 01:19:06,645
But you used to rub hot water
on my chest when I throw up, Mom!

1142
01:19:06,854 --> 01:19:11,395
I won't scribble on the walls.
I won't play games on cell phones.

1143
01:19:11,854 --> 01:19:16,479
I won't hit anyone.
Or steal chocolates and eat them.

1144
01:19:16,604 --> 01:19:22,187
I won't waste food.
I'll do my homework on time, Mom.

1145
01:19:22,270 --> 01:19:25,229
I won't be called a bad boy again.

1146
01:19:25,729 --> 01:19:29,937
You were humiliated by my teachers
because of me.

1147
01:19:30,270 --> 01:19:35,520
I won't get into trouble again, Mom!

1148
01:19:35,770 --> 01:19:37,145
Please, Mom!

1149
01:19:39,729 --> 01:19:44,145
Kavin!
-Please get me out of here, Mom.

1150
01:19:45,354 --> 01:19:47,645
Naina, don't cry.

1151
01:19:55,270 --> 01:19:57,312
Let's get him out of here?

1152
01:19:57,645 --> 01:19:59,895
I've never seen Naina so upset.

1153
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:02,604
She's undergone so much change
in just a week.

1154
01:20:03,104 --> 01:20:06,479
If she continues here for a year,
won't everything be fixed?

1155
01:20:11,187 --> 01:20:13,229
"Sir, the other day at the morning assembly…"

1156
01:20:13,312 --> 01:20:16,645
"You said that electricity and water
shouldn't be wasted…"

1157
01:20:16,770 --> 01:20:19,687
"But there are three loose pipes
in our canteen."

1158
01:20:20,020 --> 01:20:23,937
"There are plastic bags and cups
lying everywhere."

1159
01:20:24,354 --> 01:20:26,562
"Please fix this, sir."

1160
01:20:26,937 --> 01:20:27,854
"Yours, Abhiman."

1161
01:20:28,604 --> 01:20:29,604
Superb, man!

1162
01:20:29,854 --> 01:20:34,645
I'll surely call the people concerned
and have this fixed. Okay?

1163
01:20:34,854 --> 01:20:37,437
Okay, today you get two stars.
-Thank you, Mom.

1164
01:20:37,979 --> 01:20:38,812
Thank you, Sir.

1165
01:20:41,312 --> 01:20:44,687
Kleptomania is a mental condition.

1166
01:20:45,354 --> 01:20:48,270
Theft handedness,
just like left handedness.

1167
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:51,395
Even an extremely wealthy person…

1168
01:20:51,604 --> 01:20:55,562
Gets pushed to the state of mind
where they want to steal worthless objects.

1169
01:20:55,645 --> 01:20:58,895
Be it an everyday object,
or something that belongs to someone else.

1170
01:20:59,062 --> 01:21:00,729
They desire some objects.

1171
01:21:00,979 --> 01:21:04,562
They lay their hands on the object,
believing that they own the right to do so.

1172
01:21:04,645 --> 01:21:06,354
Impulse control disorder.

1173
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:10,270
Even if the object they steal
has no apparent value to them…

1174
01:21:10,812 --> 01:21:13,979
They safeguard it and they save it like
little trophies.

1175
01:21:14,104 --> 01:21:15,229
Yes, Sir!

1176
01:21:15,270 --> 01:21:16,645
This is a rich man's disorder.

1177
01:21:17,020 --> 01:21:18,854
Is this a rich man's disorder?
-Yes.

1178
01:21:18,895 --> 01:21:19,645
About money…

1179
01:21:20,729 --> 01:21:23,895
Even many rich people
are affected by this. You don't worry.

1180
01:21:24,229 --> 01:21:26,354
First, we must start your psychotherapy.

1181
01:21:26,479 --> 01:21:28,270
Then we'll give you the SSRI treatment.

1182
01:21:28,354 --> 01:21:30,520
Will it cost a lot?
-Yes.

1183
01:21:30,687 --> 01:21:32,395
But you can fund it?

1184
01:21:33,104 --> 01:21:35,020
Doctor, I don't do money!
Only objects.

1185
01:21:37,895 --> 01:21:41,354
The doctor said no need to worry.
Why are you so low?

1186
01:21:41,937 --> 01:21:43,604
I'm so ashamed of myself.

1187
01:21:44,020 --> 01:21:45,895
The doctor was such a great guy.

1188
01:21:46,604 --> 01:21:48,687
He gave me therapy!

1189
01:21:49,187 --> 01:21:50,979
How would he manage
without his stethoscope?

1190
01:21:54,645 --> 01:21:56,395
Thank you, Doctor!
-You, sneak…

1191
01:21:57,354 --> 01:22:01,145
My hand resists,
but the heart persists.

1192
01:22:01,562 --> 01:22:02,812
What can I do, Divya?

1193
01:22:33,020 --> 01:22:34,229
Smells great.

1194
01:22:35,145 --> 01:22:36,645
Who are your friends?

1195
01:22:36,645 --> 01:22:38,312
They're from 'E' Block, Granny!
-Oh!

1196
01:22:45,979 --> 01:22:48,229
Wow, superb!

1197
01:22:53,229 --> 01:22:57,979
You've scribbled all over the walls.
Won't your mum slap your arm?

1198
01:22:58,020 --> 01:23:01,687
They enjoy everything I do.
-Such a lucky boy.

1199
01:23:02,354 --> 01:23:05,104
My mum hit me in the hand,
because my house owner yelled.

1200
01:23:05,229 --> 01:23:07,312
Now I don't like to draw.

1201
01:23:10,979 --> 01:23:12,312
What are these stars for?

1202
01:23:12,354 --> 01:23:15,354
If I do what my mum says,
she gives me a star.

1203
01:23:15,937 --> 01:23:17,770
Look how many I have!

1204
01:23:17,812 --> 01:23:19,104
These are my stars.

1205
01:23:20,770 --> 01:23:22,520
You're such a creative cook!

1206
01:23:22,687 --> 01:23:24,979
Is it really good?
-From now, you cook.

1207
01:23:25,020 --> 01:23:26,020
It's superb.

1208
01:23:28,687 --> 01:23:32,437
Oh, Kamakshi!
Who is that?

1209
01:23:32,645 --> 01:23:34,729
They're my friends. Kavin and Naina.

1210
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:38,687
Their parents hit them, it seems.
They were crying in the park.

1211
01:23:38,729 --> 01:23:40,520
So we brought them here.
-Oh!

1212
01:23:52,020 --> 01:23:54,312
Is your dad a cook?

1213
01:23:54,354 --> 01:23:56,229
No, he's a doctor.

1214
01:23:57,937 --> 01:23:59,020
Come, let's eat.

1215
01:23:59,812 --> 01:24:00,895
I can't find her.

1216
01:24:01,895 --> 01:24:02,604
Naina!

1217
01:24:04,604 --> 01:24:07,145
Aunty, I heard you never hit Abhiman.

1218
01:24:07,395 --> 01:24:08,229
Never.

1219
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:11,645
Is Abhiman a good student?
-He's average.

1220
01:24:11,895 --> 01:24:15,270
So how's hostel life?
Why did they hit you anyway?

1221
01:24:15,312 --> 01:24:16,812
Did you misbehave?

1222
01:24:17,104 --> 01:24:19,937
Why do all parents pry so much?

1223
01:24:22,270 --> 01:24:24,687
Sorry.
May I ask what you'll eat?

1224
01:24:24,895 --> 01:24:27,645
We're so angry,
we'll eat anything you give us.

1225
01:24:27,729 --> 01:24:29,437
Did you look in the swimming pool?

1226
01:24:30,354 --> 01:24:33,020
Does your dad get you
everything you ask for?

1227
01:24:33,354 --> 01:24:37,645
Ice creams give me a cold.
But he buys me anyway!

1228
01:24:38,395 --> 01:24:42,270
Then he happily gives me
medicine before I could catch a cold.

1229
01:24:42,479 --> 01:24:46,020
Abhi, can we exchange our parents?

1230
01:24:46,395 --> 01:24:48,020
No, man. I love my mom and dad.

1231
01:24:50,020 --> 01:24:52,729
Juice for the naughty little ones.
-Aunty!

1232
01:24:52,770 --> 01:24:55,437
Is there ice in it?
Mom will get mad.

1233
01:24:55,895 --> 01:24:57,145
No.
-Aunty…

1234
01:24:57,270 --> 01:25:01,770
There are these ladies
in T.V ads who are sweet to children...

1235
01:25:01,979 --> 01:25:03,395
You look like them.

1236
01:25:03,604 --> 01:25:05,145
Is that so?

1237
01:25:13,062 --> 01:25:16,812
She talks well.
But she won't say why her mom hit her.

1238
01:25:17,395 --> 01:25:20,145
Yes, you never told us.

1239
01:25:20,562 --> 01:25:22,354
Tell them.
-Shall I?

1240
01:25:24,020 --> 01:25:26,104
They put us in a hostel.

1241
01:25:26,104 --> 01:25:28,812
But we didn't like it there.

1242
01:25:29,229 --> 01:25:31,020
Want to know what we did there?

1243
01:25:31,020 --> 01:25:34,479
Friends, shall I tell you a story?

1244
01:25:34,520 --> 01:25:38,020
You can tell stories?
-I tell great stories.

1245
01:25:38,270 --> 01:25:39,812
What story?

1246
01:25:40,020 --> 01:25:41,229
A doggie story?

1247
01:25:41,479 --> 01:25:43,520
Or no.
I'll tell a ghost story.

1248
01:25:45,229 --> 01:25:47,020
Tell us the doggie story.

1249
01:25:47,312 --> 01:25:50,020
There's a ghost amongst us now.

1250
01:25:51,729 --> 01:25:53,854
What do you mean?

1251
01:25:54,312 --> 01:25:56,479
Yes, look over there.

1252
01:25:56,729 --> 01:25:59,145
Hi, Shalini. How are you?

1253
01:26:00,020 --> 01:26:02,979
Hi, Naina. I'm fine.

1254
01:26:03,437 --> 01:26:06,270
Have you eaten?
-Yes, I just ate.

1255
01:26:07,104 --> 01:26:10,145
There's no one there.
She's lying.

1256
01:26:12,437 --> 01:26:14,979
Who is Shalini?
Where is she?

1257
01:26:15,020 --> 01:26:18,020
She was my neighbour
in my old apartment.

1258
01:26:18,187 --> 01:26:22,937
After school, we found a puppy
lying on the road.

1259
01:26:23,229 --> 01:26:27,104
She went to save the pup.
An ambulance hit her and she died.

1260
01:26:27,312 --> 01:26:29,812
Ambulance is meant to save people.

1261
01:26:29,854 --> 01:26:32,770
Yes. But it killed Shalini.

1262
01:26:33,020 --> 01:26:36,604
She sleeps with me at night.

1263
01:26:36,895 --> 01:26:38,770
She talks only to me.

1264
01:26:38,937 --> 01:26:40,479
Go away! I'm scared.

1265
01:26:40,562 --> 01:26:42,312
Stop this. I'm scared, too.

1266
01:26:44,312 --> 01:26:47,604
Shalini, not now.
They're getting scared.

1267
01:26:47,937 --> 01:26:51,604
Come back when everyone
has gone to sleep, okay?

1268
01:26:55,479 --> 01:26:56,604
Bye!

1269
01:27:06,229 --> 01:27:08,604
Oh no! It's HER.

1270
01:27:13,104 --> 01:27:14,604
Who is she?

1271
01:27:14,937 --> 01:27:19,270
This lady usually sits in graveyards.

1272
01:27:19,770 --> 01:27:22,729
Her drunkard husband hit her
 and she…

1273
01:27:24,020 --> 01:27:25,562
Hung herself to death.

1274
01:27:26,604 --> 01:27:28,104
No more stories.

1275
01:27:28,479 --> 01:27:29,312
Look!

1276
01:27:29,395 --> 01:27:30,437
You can't come here.

1277
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:31,854
You're scaring everyone.

1278
01:27:31,895 --> 01:27:32,687
Go away!

1279
01:27:33,770 --> 01:27:36,937
It is coming towards us.
Everybody, run!

1280
01:27:39,812 --> 01:27:41,145
Please, Aunty!

1281
01:27:41,187 --> 01:27:42,895
Don't…

1282
01:28:02,104 --> 01:28:04,770
The kids are screaming!
And you're on the phone?

1283
01:28:04,937 --> 01:28:08,729
Come closer, I dare you.
-What's happened?

1284
01:28:09,604 --> 01:28:11,020
She's telling us ghost stories!

1285
01:28:11,104 --> 01:28:13,020
Why are you telling them
ghost stories at this time?

1286
01:28:13,104 --> 01:28:14,770
Are you the warden, woman?

1287
01:28:15,020 --> 01:28:17,312
Won't you mind your job?

1288
01:28:17,562 --> 01:28:20,187
Sis, hit that woman!

1289
01:28:29,395 --> 01:28:32,645
Mommy! Oh God…
Come here, everybody!

1290
01:28:32,687 --> 01:28:35,145
Quick, please!

1291
01:28:35,770 --> 01:28:38,729
The warden is lying in the bathroom….

1292
01:28:38,854 --> 01:28:41,145
In a pool of his blood!

1293
01:28:41,437 --> 01:28:44,312
If he dies,
will he become a ghost?

1294
01:28:46,395 --> 01:28:48,229
What do we do now?

1295
01:28:52,187 --> 01:28:53,979
What's the matter here?
-Oh no!

1296
01:28:54,104 --> 01:28:55,854
No yelling. Don't shout.

1297
01:28:55,979 --> 01:28:57,645
I said, don't shout!
No shouting.

1298
01:28:58,479 --> 01:28:59,854
What happened?
-Stop crying.

1299
01:28:59,937 --> 01:29:02,687
I hear his voice,
but I can't see the man.

1300
01:29:02,812 --> 01:29:05,020
He is right here.
-I'm right here.

1301
01:29:05,020 --> 01:29:08,854
Oh no! I hear the voice again.
But can't see the man.

1302
01:29:09,104 --> 01:29:10,937
What's wrong?
-I'm lying dead?

1303
01:29:14,479 --> 01:29:15,562
Am I lying in there?

1304
01:29:24,729 --> 01:29:27,104
Kids!
-It's the ghost!

1305
01:29:28,979 --> 01:29:31,479
I looked but I couldn't find my body.

1306
01:29:32,395 --> 01:29:34,104
I can hear his voice!

1307
01:29:34,187 --> 01:29:35,895
I'm not there.

1308
01:29:35,937 --> 01:29:38,312
Oh no!
I hear his voice again…

1309
01:29:40,145 --> 01:29:42,604
I hear the dead warden!

1310
01:29:48,548 --> 01:29:50,423
They wreaked havoc last night!

1311
01:29:50,631 --> 01:29:52,756
They made me wet my pants.

1312
01:29:52,965 --> 01:29:55,131
Hello?
-What's happening? My son is so afraid...

1313
01:29:55,131 --> 01:29:57,798
No, nothing of that sort.
Nothing to fear, sir.

1314
01:29:59,048 --> 01:30:01,756
Is there a ghost in the hostel?
-No, sir. No such thing!

1315
01:30:04,048 --> 01:30:06,506
All the parents want to
take their children home.

1316
01:30:06,548 --> 01:30:08,590
Have those two devils taken home.

1317
01:30:20,215 --> 01:30:21,715
Oh, no!

1318
01:30:22,090 --> 01:30:24,631
Shalini, you've come here too?

1319
01:30:25,548 --> 01:30:27,048
Who is Shalini?
Huh?

1320
01:30:32,131 --> 01:30:32,881
Look here.

1321
01:30:32,965 --> 01:30:36,923
If someone asks me which school I went to,
I'd name one.

1322
01:30:37,173 --> 01:30:38,673
How many schools will you name?

1323
01:30:38,840 --> 01:30:41,298
I'll name 5-6 schools.

1324
01:30:41,631 --> 01:30:42,506
You will!

1325
01:30:42,881 --> 01:30:45,215
Trying to tell ME your stories?
-Why are you hitting me?

1326
01:30:45,256 --> 01:30:48,215
You will…
-What happened?

1327
01:30:48,423 --> 01:30:50,340
Get out of my sight.
Go!

1328
01:30:51,215 --> 01:30:53,381
Let me go, Mum!
-You brat!

1329
01:30:53,423 --> 01:30:55,090
Daddy, see..?

1330
01:30:55,340 --> 01:30:57,548
Spank him!
-Daddy's hitting me…

1331
01:30:57,590 --> 01:30:58,965
Divya!
-Go inside.

1332
01:30:59,673 --> 01:31:00,756
Let me go!

1333
01:31:00,881 --> 01:31:04,965
Hit her hard. Mad child.
-I won't live with you anymore.

1334
01:31:05,423 --> 01:31:07,298
Got hit so badly.

1335
01:31:07,465 --> 01:31:08,465
Poor you!

1336
01:31:11,465 --> 01:31:17,131
It's so violent for a person weighing 70 kg
to hit someone who weighs 17.

1337
01:31:18,215 --> 01:31:18,965
Poor things.

1338
01:31:23,256 --> 01:31:23,881
Kavin!

1339
01:31:25,173 --> 01:31:26,965
Brother?
-I haven't seen Kavin.

1340
01:31:27,006 --> 01:31:30,215
You're ogling so hard.
Don't fall into that sewer.

1341
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:31,548
Kavin?

1342
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:32,548
Kavin?

1343
01:31:35,465 --> 01:31:37,465
Sir.
You look nervous...

1344
01:31:37,506 --> 01:31:38,590
I'm looking for my daughter.

1345
01:31:39,215 --> 01:31:39,923
Thank god!

1346
01:31:39,965 --> 01:31:41,506
I said I'm looking for my daughter.
You're thanking god?

1347
01:31:41,548 --> 01:31:44,756
No, my son is missing too!
I thought he wandered away alone.

1348
01:31:44,798 --> 01:31:46,965
But they've gone missing together.
-Let's look for them?

1349
01:31:47,048 --> 01:31:49,256
They're not there.
-They're not there, either.

1350
01:31:50,590 --> 01:31:51,548
This way, then?

1351
01:31:51,715 --> 01:31:52,965
Kavin!
Naina!

1352
01:31:53,215 --> 01:31:54,798
Is this your house?
Ring the bell.

1353
01:31:55,590 --> 01:31:56,756
They're not there.

1354
01:31:57,173 --> 01:31:58,215
Nobody home?

1355
01:31:58,798 --> 01:32:03,131
My dad would either be on the phone.
Or in the bathroom.

1356
01:32:08,256 --> 01:32:10,423
Where were you?
We've been looking everywhere.

1357
01:32:10,465 --> 01:32:12,465
Sorry, sorry.
They were at our place.

1358
01:32:12,756 --> 01:32:13,965
A doctor should know better.

1359
01:32:14,006 --> 01:32:15,590
Don't you know
their parents would be worried?

1360
01:32:16,131 --> 01:32:17,173
It's my fault.

1361
01:32:17,298 --> 01:32:20,256
They were pouring their hears out.
I was engrossed hearing them.

1362
01:32:22,090 --> 01:32:25,381
Don't mistake me for saying this again.
Bring them to my clinic.

1363
01:32:26,798 --> 01:32:29,215
We'll talk about stuff.
Here is my card.

1364
01:32:32,631 --> 01:32:34,215
Let's go!
Sorry, bye.

1365
01:32:36,173 --> 01:32:36,923
See?

1366
01:32:37,381 --> 01:32:40,173
Doctors have started picking patients
at their doorsteps.

1367
01:32:40,381 --> 01:32:41,423
Good business!

1368
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:45,256
We've seen so many doctors.

1369
01:32:46,298 --> 01:32:47,590
Might as well see him, too.

1370
01:32:48,965 --> 01:32:53,090
Doctor, even if there's a small pain,
I fear that it's an attack.

1371
01:32:53,381 --> 01:32:54,506
I've seen too many doctors.

1372
01:32:54,590 --> 01:32:56,631
So I chucked your card away
the other day.

1373
01:32:56,673 --> 01:32:58,298
Sorry, doctor.
-No problem.

1374
01:32:58,423 --> 01:33:02,881
There is a different doctor for every illness.
You just hadn't seen the right one.

1375
01:33:03,673 --> 01:33:07,381
Some parents check their active children
for hyperactivity.

1376
01:33:07,673 --> 01:33:11,506
In some cases, hyperactive kids are
dismissed as "naughty".

1377
01:33:12,173 --> 01:33:12,965
Both are wrong.

1378
01:33:13,465 --> 01:33:15,548
Doctor, how much do you charge?

1379
01:33:15,631 --> 01:33:18,881
Do you have an MRI scan equipment?
-Why talk about that now?

1380
01:33:19,215 --> 01:33:24,798
Because we've done X-rays, scans
and every test head-to-toe.

1381
01:33:25,048 --> 01:33:26,048
No need for all that.

1382
01:33:27,090 --> 01:33:29,423
How will scans reveal anything
about a naughty kid?

1383
01:33:29,673 --> 01:33:30,256
I mean…

1384
01:33:30,298 --> 01:33:34,465
Don't mistake me, but everyone uses
our kids as a weakness and cheat us!

1385
01:33:34,923 --> 01:33:37,090
Right from toy vendors
to the school managements.

1386
01:33:37,423 --> 01:33:38,923
Even cloth sellers!

1387
01:33:39,256 --> 01:33:42,673
If they charge 500 for adults,
they charge 1,550 for kids.

1388
01:33:43,090 --> 01:33:45,340
Try asking a doctor what's wrong
with the kid…

1389
01:33:45,423 --> 01:33:46,131
That's all!

1390
01:33:46,465 --> 01:33:49,256
They live just to snatch
every last penny from us.

1391
01:33:50,215 --> 01:33:53,423
Akhil, If you get so emotional,
they'll give you a free one, too.

1392
01:33:53,923 --> 01:33:55,256
What?
-Blood pressure.

1393
01:33:56,131 --> 01:33:57,590
I've got enough of that, sir.

1394
01:33:58,298 --> 01:34:00,131
What's wrong with those kids?

1395
01:34:00,756 --> 01:34:04,006
Before healing these kids,
we need to heal their parents.

1396
01:34:06,340 --> 01:34:06,923
Yes.

1397
01:34:07,506 --> 01:34:09,090
They need counselling first.

1398
01:34:09,256 --> 01:34:10,798
They're at the peak of stress.

1399
01:34:11,131 --> 01:34:13,631
And that bank manager.
He's at the peak of all peaks!

1400
01:34:14,756 --> 01:34:17,881
Poor people.
This can't be fixed in one meeting.

1401
01:34:18,298 --> 01:34:20,715
I'm tired.
And hungry!

1402
01:34:20,756 --> 01:34:23,881
Food is here.
-My dear! You brought it yourself?

1403
01:34:25,048 --> 01:34:25,756
Akhil…

1404
01:34:26,215 --> 01:34:27,506
What do you think about Bill Gates?

1405
01:34:27,923 --> 01:34:28,840
Bill Gates?

1406
01:34:29,131 --> 01:34:30,756
He's the richest man in the world.

1407
01:34:30,923 --> 01:34:32,506
Ten times richer than Ambani.

1408
01:34:33,298 --> 01:34:35,673
If we had that much money,
I think we'd go mad.

1409
01:34:36,798 --> 01:34:37,590
Michael Jackson?

1410
01:34:37,965 --> 01:34:40,340
Oh, I'm a huge fan of his!

1411
01:34:40,465 --> 01:34:43,840
When I was in school,
I had his posters all over my walls.

1412
01:34:44,465 --> 01:34:45,923
So graceful! So stylish!

1413
01:34:45,965 --> 01:34:49,756
When his songs come on T.V,
I'd never switch channels.

1414
01:34:50,840 --> 01:34:51,965
Do you like Lord Krishna?

1415
01:34:52,215 --> 01:34:54,506
Come on.
How could one not like Lord Krishna?

1416
01:34:54,631 --> 01:34:56,715
I still love to watch the T.V show on him.

1417
01:34:56,798 --> 01:34:58,048
Right from Krishna…

1418
01:34:58,256 --> 01:35:01,590
Bill Gates, Michael Jackson, Tom Cruise,
Jim Carrey, Albert Einstein…

1419
01:35:01,673 --> 01:35:06,548
And several geniuses from our country...
Have all been hyperactive children.

1420
01:35:07,340 --> 01:35:10,673
That very special personality trait
that these people possessed…

1421
01:35:11,965 --> 01:35:13,173
Your son possesses it.

1422
01:35:13,256 --> 01:35:14,298
What do you mean?

1423
01:35:14,673 --> 01:35:16,006
Yes, I'm serious.

1424
01:35:16,548 --> 01:35:21,173
To believe what I'm saying,
you must remove your glasses first.

1425
01:35:23,923 --> 01:35:26,215
Not the glasses you're wearing!

1426
01:35:26,381 --> 01:35:28,840
I meant the tinted glasses with which
you view your children.

1427
01:35:29,006 --> 01:35:30,006
You can wear these.

1428
01:35:31,340 --> 01:35:32,006
Okay…

1429
01:35:32,215 --> 01:35:35,215
What your child has,
is not an illness or a disease.

1430
01:35:35,798 --> 01:35:37,465
It's a part of her personality.

1431
01:35:37,673 --> 01:35:39,381
She's not a special kid.

1432
01:35:39,590 --> 01:35:40,590
She's a super kid!

1433
01:35:40,965 --> 01:35:42,965
It's called ADHD.

1434
01:35:43,965 --> 01:35:46,215
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.

1435
01:35:47,215 --> 01:35:50,548
So he can't lead
a normal life, like other kids?

1436
01:35:50,673 --> 01:35:53,631
Just because they stand out in the crowd,
don't think they are abnormal.

1437
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:55,923
They can be extraordinary, outstanding.

1438
01:35:56,131 --> 01:35:58,590
They don't stand out.
They stand apart.

1439
01:35:59,090 --> 01:36:02,756
They don't take the paths laid for them;
They wish to make their own.

1440
01:36:02,965 --> 01:36:06,673
That's all right.
But we can't just let kids go astray.

1441
01:36:07,006 --> 01:36:08,256
Academics is important, too.

1442
01:36:08,590 --> 01:36:10,965
If they don't study well,
how will they get into Ivy League schools?

1443
01:36:11,673 --> 01:36:14,673
Ivy League schools are great.
I'm not telling you not to have goals.

1444
01:36:15,048 --> 01:36:18,631
But we needn't make them achieve
what we failed to.

1445
01:36:19,465 --> 01:36:21,173
She's not just hyperactive.

1446
01:36:21,548 --> 01:36:23,465
She's hyperactive and highly intelligent.

1447
01:36:23,548 --> 01:36:25,965
In fact, she'll always be two steps ahead of us.

1448
01:36:26,840 --> 01:36:28,590
They even make mistakes brilliantly.

1449
01:36:30,173 --> 01:36:32,548
She's a gifted child.

1450
01:36:35,881 --> 01:36:38,006
All said and done, when she
doesn't score well…

1451
01:36:38,048 --> 01:36:41,423
We end up having to bow our heads
at the school.

1452
01:36:41,756 --> 01:36:44,423
We chose to stand in the queues
to enroll our children there.

1453
01:36:44,798 --> 01:36:47,048
So we're the ones who must
bow our heads, too.

1454
01:36:48,756 --> 01:36:50,006
I'm just kidding.

1455
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:53,840
Many schools don't teach lessons.

1456
01:36:54,298 --> 01:36:55,923
They only train them to write exams.

1457
01:36:57,881 --> 01:37:00,465
Please, let's get out of that rat race.

1458
01:37:02,298 --> 01:37:04,298
Let's not plant grades in their heads.

1459
01:37:05,173 --> 01:37:06,756
Let's plant good thoughts.

1460
01:37:07,256 --> 01:37:08,798
When will he get better?

1461
01:37:08,965 --> 01:37:10,173
It will get better with time.

1462
01:37:11,715 --> 01:37:13,715
Your clinic looks like a school!

1463
01:37:13,756 --> 01:37:15,256
Really? Thank you.

1464
01:37:15,465 --> 01:37:18,590
Will Naina get admitted into the school
that your kids go to?

1465
01:37:20,840 --> 01:37:23,840
Actually, my wife works for the school.
I'll try talking to her.

1466
01:37:23,965 --> 01:37:26,923
Hello.
Doctor Uncle is busy.

1467
01:37:26,965 --> 01:37:27,881
It's okay.
-Naina!

1468
01:37:28,548 --> 01:37:29,423
Thank you, Naina.

1469
01:37:36,590 --> 01:37:38,381
Hi, Kavin. Hi, Naina!

1470
01:37:38,423 --> 01:37:39,423
Welcome!

1471
01:37:40,215 --> 01:37:42,048
You may leave. I'll take it from here.

1472
01:37:42,381 --> 01:37:44,381
You said this won't be like other schools.

1473
01:37:45,048 --> 01:37:47,465
But you're punishing them
with sit-ups here, too?

1474
01:37:50,631 --> 01:37:51,798
That's not a punishment.

1475
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:53,298
It's called super brain yoga.

1476
01:37:53,715 --> 01:37:59,173
It's a small exercise that helps kids
be active and concentrate.

1477
01:37:59,965 --> 01:38:01,381
Don't worry. I'll take care.

1478
01:38:01,798 --> 01:38:02,840
Bye!

1479
01:38:02,965 --> 01:38:05,673
Hey, kids.
You've got new friends today.

1480
01:38:06,131 --> 01:38:07,298
You may sit there.

1481
01:38:07,965 --> 01:38:09,423
Okay, children.

1482
01:38:09,756 --> 01:38:10,715
Five...

1483
01:38:10,965 --> 01:38:11,965
Four...

1484
01:38:12,256 --> 01:38:13,173
Three...

1485
01:38:13,381 --> 01:38:14,215
Two...

1486
01:38:14,423 --> 01:38:15,256
One.

1487
01:38:15,631 --> 01:38:17,090
Ready!

1488
01:38:21,506 --> 01:38:23,965
Are they crazy?
-I think so, yes.

1489
01:38:26,798 --> 01:38:28,340
Naina, why aren't you laughing?

1490
01:38:28,381 --> 01:38:30,173
Why should I laugh like I'm crazy?

1491
01:38:31,381 --> 01:38:36,215
When you laugh really hard,
your muscles relax…

1492
01:38:36,298 --> 01:38:37,590
And you loosen up.

1493
01:38:37,673 --> 01:38:40,340
We can all relax and pay attention to class.

1494
01:38:40,881 --> 01:38:44,798
Students in foreign countries follow this.
-Superb!

1495
01:39:13,423 --> 01:39:14,715
So to conclude…

1496
01:39:15,256 --> 01:39:17,423
Teachers...
And doctors like me...

1497
01:39:17,590 --> 01:39:20,048
Should continue to talk
and give the right advice.

1498
01:39:20,090 --> 01:39:22,506
I'm sure it'd be very interesting.
Go ahead.

1499
01:39:23,215 --> 01:39:24,923
Kids are the seeds.

1500
01:39:25,506 --> 01:39:27,506
Parents are the gardeners.

1501
01:39:28,298 --> 01:39:31,590
Our family is the soil that holds the seed.

1502
01:39:32,131 --> 01:39:34,131
Teachers are the sunlight.

1503
01:39:34,340 --> 01:39:35,798
Their friends are the water.

1504
01:39:36,006 --> 01:39:40,048
You could say that therapists and doctors
are like agriculture officers.

1505
01:39:40,673 --> 01:39:45,090
More than any doctor's therapy,
family therapy is the best.

1506
01:39:45,923 --> 01:39:50,548
Only parents who play with their children
can control ADHD.

1507
01:39:51,923 --> 01:39:54,548
When I say parents,
I mean both the parents.

1508
01:39:54,881 --> 01:39:55,881
Dads also, alright?

1509
01:39:56,173 --> 01:39:56,881
See?

1510
01:39:58,590 --> 01:40:01,423
But mothers are the best therapists.

1511
01:40:12,298 --> 01:40:16,965
"Dum Dum- That sound Dum Dum;
Dum Dum- Beats our little hearts."

1512
01:40:17,090 --> 01:40:20,715
"Can't you hear the music?"

1513
01:40:21,256 --> 01:40:30,131
"Mischief is a part of a child's joy!
Children shouldn't be still like a toy."

1514
01:40:30,256 --> 01:40:34,631
"Don't you worry about your future;
We're children of the nature."

1515
01:40:34,673 --> 01:40:39,340
"Hopping from branch to branch;
We sure are a happy bunch!"

1516
01:40:52,715 --> 01:40:56,881
"Dum Dum- That sound Dum Dum;
Dum Dum- Beats our little hearts."

1517
01:40:57,381 --> 01:41:00,881
"Can't you hear the music?"

1518
01:41:19,798 --> 01:41:22,006
My friend told me ADHD can never be cured.

1519
01:41:22,465 --> 01:41:25,090
Doctors just continue treatments
to make money.

1520
01:41:25,506 --> 01:41:30,090
You may have doubts in life.
But you should never doubt life.

1521
01:41:30,923 --> 01:41:31,881
Disgusting.

1522
01:41:43,090 --> 01:41:45,131
Thanks, Mom. Thanks, Dad.

1523
01:41:51,423 --> 01:41:56,673
You can buy pencils or chocolates
from The Honesty Shop even without money…

1524
01:41:56,756 --> 01:42:00,298
Like Kavin and Naina did,
you can take it and pay for it tomorrow.

1525
01:42:00,340 --> 01:42:02,256
Okay?
-Okay, Ma'am.

1526
01:42:04,131 --> 01:42:12,965
"Back in my mother's womb,
I was allowed to shake a limb."

1527
01:42:13,090 --> 01:42:21,131
"Having been born in this world,
Why is it that we must hold still?"

1528
01:42:21,215 --> 01:42:29,340
"Can a soul that doesn't travel,
Ever find it's home?"

1529
01:42:30,173 --> 01:42:38,798
"Wander…
Wander where your heart takes you."

1530
01:42:39,381 --> 01:42:47,340
"And when you seek
Many skies to fly…"

1531
01:42:48,423 --> 01:42:55,965
"I will come for you, child!
And be your wings..."

1532
01:42:56,631 --> 01:42:59,965
I'm sure they can cook better than you.

1533
01:43:37,881 --> 01:43:41,881
You can own a phone,
but don't let the phone own you.

1534
01:43:42,215 --> 01:43:42,965
Okay?

1535
01:43:49,298 --> 01:43:50,465
I'm done!

1536
01:43:51,006 --> 01:43:51,756
Wow!

1537
01:43:52,715 --> 01:43:53,715
Thank you.

1538
01:44:07,215 --> 01:44:15,923
"By growing this school of fish,
In small bowls made of glass."

1539
01:44:16,215 --> 01:44:24,298
"We're denying them the chance,
To swim across mighty oceans."

1540
01:44:24,381 --> 01:44:31,965
"Fly,
Fly like the pretty kite."

1541
01:44:33,256 --> 01:44:42,173
"Be free,
No strings holding you back."

1542
01:44:42,423 --> 01:44:59,340
"You are just like a morning blossom, my dear.
No one shall pluck you while I'm still here."

1543
01:45:09,506 --> 01:45:17,798
"Dum Dum- That sound Dum Dum;
Dum Dum- Beats our little hearts."

1544
01:45:22,090 --> 01:45:24,215
Is everyone sitting
in their favourite seats?

1545
01:45:24,256 --> 01:45:25,423
Yes, Ma'am!

1546
01:45:26,881 --> 01:45:29,923
Oh, it's Talentina 2014.

1547
01:45:29,965 --> 01:45:34,756
Anyone interested in participating
in Talentina Interschool  competition…

1548
01:45:34,881 --> 01:45:37,131
Must come forward
and give me their names.

1549
01:45:37,173 --> 01:45:39,090
I won't compel anyone.

1550
01:45:39,631 --> 01:45:41,340
Who wants to participate?

1551
01:45:41,381 --> 01:45:42,215
Me!

1552
01:45:42,381 --> 01:45:43,381
I'll tell a story!

1553
01:45:43,423 --> 01:45:44,881
I'll dance!

1554
01:45:45,048 --> 01:45:47,756
How will telling stories help her future?

1555
01:45:48,090 --> 01:45:51,673
Dance and music, too.
Won't get them anywhere, right?

1556
01:45:52,090 --> 01:45:54,715
Don't take Kavin's interest
in music and dance so lightly.

1557
01:45:54,756 --> 01:45:57,256
Think Maestro Ilayaraja or A.R Rahman?

1558
01:45:57,548 --> 01:46:01,965
Didn't the author of Harry Potter books,
J.K Rowling, make millions writing fiction?

1559
01:46:02,256 --> 01:46:07,465
Even our writers J.Krishnamoorthy, Sujatha
and Chetan Bhagat make fine examples.

1560
01:46:07,548 --> 01:46:10,881
So don't think her storytelling is useless
for Naina's future.

1561
01:46:11,548 --> 01:46:16,715
Rather than thinking their talents are a waste,
we must enjoy their antics.

1562
01:46:18,381 --> 01:46:20,673
What do you want Kavin to be?

1563
01:46:21,673 --> 01:46:23,631
Just not like his father.

1564
01:46:27,381 --> 01:46:28,881
Done with your spot painting?

1565
01:46:29,256 --> 01:46:31,631
Wow, Abhiman!
-Excellent!

1566
01:46:32,256 --> 01:46:34,881
Come here. Superb!
-Superb.

1567
01:46:35,798 --> 01:46:39,715
Both your kids are so smart.
I am envious.

1568
01:46:40,742 --> 01:46:42,298
What's your technique?

1569
01:46:42,381 --> 01:46:45,840
When I was pregnant,
we did something good.

1570
01:46:46,036 --> 01:46:47,953
It was about three months
into our marriage.

1571
01:46:48,703 --> 01:46:50,619
What's the matter?
You wanted to talk?

1572
01:46:53,536 --> 01:46:55,078
A surprise?
Okay, fine.

1573
01:46:58,244 --> 01:46:59,078
Thank you!

1574
01:46:59,619 --> 01:47:00,369
Is it a watch?

1575
01:47:06,786 --> 01:47:08,661
You're going to be a father.

1576
01:47:17,453 --> 01:47:18,619
You are so beautiful.

1577
01:47:19,036 --> 01:47:19,911
Really?

1578
01:47:19,911 --> 01:47:22,953
Then write me a letter about it.

1579
01:47:24,369 --> 01:47:26,661
I'll write you a hundred.

1580
01:47:37,453 --> 01:47:40,994
Daddy's home, baby.
-Hello, wifey. What are you guys upto?

1581
01:47:41,132 --> 01:47:43,661
I was reading.
-Really? This is for you.

1582
01:47:43,786 --> 01:47:45,244
Aww.
-One more!

1583
01:47:45,786 --> 01:47:49,953
"What you truly desire;
That you will be."

1584
01:47:50,203 --> 01:47:51,828
It's written in The Gita, baby.

1585
01:47:53,953 --> 01:47:57,578
Mommy and baby are going to…

1586
01:47:58,078 --> 01:47:59,536
Brush their teeth now!

1587
01:48:04,911 --> 01:48:08,119
This is Ilayaraja's composition,
'Nothing but wind'.

1588
01:48:08,286 --> 01:48:12,411
Mommy and Daddy love it.
Want to listen to it?

1589
01:48:12,828 --> 01:48:14,744
Can you hear me?

1590
01:48:15,828 --> 01:48:17,036
He can hear us!

1591
01:48:17,078 --> 01:48:18,244
He can?
-He's kicking.

1592
01:48:18,869 --> 01:48:22,619
A fetus couldn't possibly understand
in it's sixth month?

1593
01:48:23,203 --> 01:48:23,744
Mom!

1594
01:48:23,911 --> 01:48:25,619
They start hearing at three months, it seems.

1595
01:48:26,119 --> 01:48:28,494
They react to everything.

1596
01:48:29,203 --> 01:48:30,911
Like how when we play music,
they listen calmly.

1597
01:48:30,911 --> 01:48:32,828
And to groovy folk songs,
they move their limbs.

1598
01:48:32,953 --> 01:48:33,744
Similarly…

1599
01:48:34,036 --> 01:48:37,411
They will be what we tell them.

1600
01:48:38,222 --> 01:48:41,078
Doctors say mommy
will have to undergo Caesarian surgery.

1601
01:48:41,203 --> 01:48:43,744
No, baby.
Mommy wants a normal delivery.

1602
01:48:43,911 --> 01:48:44,619
Okay?

1603
01:48:45,036 --> 01:48:47,078
We're going to your granny's town tomorrow!

1604
01:49:18,536 --> 01:49:20,244
Hear this sound?

1605
01:49:26,536 --> 01:49:27,828
And that's a baby rabbit.

1606
01:49:45,717 --> 01:49:47,509
Son-in-law, wait outside.

1607
01:49:47,988 --> 01:49:49,863
No, mom-in-law.
I'll stay with her.

1608
01:50:03,994 --> 01:50:05,036
This is great.

1609
01:50:05,953 --> 01:50:08,953
I thought family planning was all about
preventing a pregnancy.

1610
01:50:09,661 --> 01:50:15,911
I realise that it's about educating the child
right from the womb.

1611
01:50:16,244 --> 01:50:17,411
Thanks a lot.

1612
01:50:19,123 --> 01:50:22,119
We have so many talented children
in our school.

1613
01:50:22,244 --> 01:50:26,328
Why did you select Naina and Kavin
to go for the Talentina contest?

1614
01:50:26,411 --> 01:50:30,703
Only three children from each school
are allowed to participate.

1615
01:50:31,078 --> 01:50:33,744
There will be a lot of media coverage.

1616
01:50:33,953 --> 01:50:37,494
It's important that we win this.

1617
01:50:37,578 --> 01:50:39,453
That's a commercial outlook, sir.

1618
01:50:39,911 --> 01:50:42,119
What's commercial about this?

1619
01:50:43,203 --> 01:50:45,661
Oh, is it like Buddha's Renunciation?

1620
01:50:46,328 --> 01:50:47,286
Think about it.

1621
01:50:50,953 --> 01:50:51,828
No, Miss.

1622
01:50:51,911 --> 01:50:55,578
If she misbehaves there,
it will be very embarrassing.

1623
01:50:56,661 --> 01:50:57,953
We're worried too, Sir.

1624
01:50:59,953 --> 01:51:02,661
Kavin and Naina must participate
in Talentina.

1625
01:51:03,036 --> 01:51:04,703
You can make it happen.
-But...

1626
01:51:05,078 --> 01:51:07,619
The Principal forbids it.
What can I do?

1627
01:51:08,578 --> 01:51:10,453
You could say you'll quit your job.

1628
01:51:12,369 --> 01:51:14,453
You don't like such schools.
-Sir!

1629
01:51:14,953 --> 01:51:16,453
These two have to participate...

1630
01:51:16,536 --> 01:51:17,786
What's all this, Divya?

1631
01:51:20,453 --> 01:51:24,828
Is this any reason to quit?
Your son Abhimanyu is taking part in it.

1632
01:51:25,203 --> 01:51:26,786
I don't like this competition.

1633
01:51:27,453 --> 01:51:30,703
You know I worked in another school before this.

1634
01:51:30,994 --> 01:51:34,328
I was told not to award 'A' Grade
to kids who score an 'A'.

1635
01:51:34,369 --> 01:51:35,411
And give them a 'B'.

1636
01:51:35,453 --> 01:51:37,578
Award a 'C' to those who score 'B'.

1637
01:51:37,953 --> 01:51:40,453
Two months later, I was to give them
'A' or 'B' grades…

1638
01:51:40,536 --> 01:51:42,703
So that we could show improvement
to the parents.

1639
01:51:42,744 --> 01:51:45,661
And report that the new kids
 are indisciplined.

1640
01:51:45,786 --> 01:51:48,036
Two months later,
say they are "Superb".

1641
01:51:48,328 --> 01:51:50,411
I said "Superb" and quit my job.

1642
01:51:50,786 --> 01:51:56,328
A school that takes in only good students
and claims to be a good school, is not one.

1643
01:51:56,536 --> 01:52:00,828
It's no big deal to make
a merited child win certificates of merit.

1644
01:52:00,994 --> 01:52:05,536
Good schools take a child
yearning for merit, and help them achieve.

1645
01:52:06,119 --> 01:52:09,911
If this is not such a school,
why should I work here?

1646
01:52:10,328 --> 01:52:12,203
I don't wish to lose a good teacher.

1647
01:52:12,536 --> 01:52:15,619
Kavin, Naina and Abhimanyu
shall represent our school.

1648
01:52:16,369 --> 01:52:17,036
Thanks, sir.

1649
01:52:17,578 --> 01:52:21,244
Children, there is a competition called Talentina 2014.

1650
01:52:21,286 --> 01:52:23,994
If interested, give your names
to your class teachers.

1651
01:52:24,036 --> 01:52:25,911
Radio City brings you...

1652
01:52:26,036 --> 01:52:29,203
Talentina Interschool Competition- 2014.

1653
01:52:29,244 --> 01:52:34,453
Students aged between 5 and 12
will be taking part...

1654
01:52:45,536 --> 01:52:46,828
Hi, hello, welcome!

1655
01:52:46,953 --> 01:52:49,036
We are all here for…

1656
01:52:49,119 --> 01:52:50,994
TALENTINA!

1657
01:52:57,078 --> 01:53:01,536
There are so many talented children
in our country.

1658
01:53:01,911 --> 01:53:05,036
What's with the sudden devotion?

1659
01:53:05,244 --> 01:53:08,119
My son is going to perform
in such a great stage for the first time.

1660
01:53:08,328 --> 01:53:12,453
So I went to a temple on my way
to pray for him.

1661
01:53:12,786 --> 01:53:14,744
I prayed for your daughter, too.

1662
01:53:14,828 --> 01:53:17,661
...We have three important guests.

1663
01:53:17,895 --> 01:53:22,062
We welcome movie director,
Mr. Seenu Ramaswamy.

1664
01:53:23,786 --> 01:53:26,369
Next…
We have the businessman…

1665
01:53:26,821 --> 01:53:31,362
Mr. Sanjay Ramaswamy!

1666
01:53:40,453 --> 01:53:43,869
King of Justice…
Mr. Imman Annachi.

1667
01:53:48,344 --> 01:53:53,885
First up to set the stage on fire,
Apple Kids.

1668
01:54:16,494 --> 01:54:19,161
Next on stage, Monish!

1669
01:54:19,203 --> 01:54:20,911
Round of applause!

1670
01:54:56,078 --> 01:54:58,328
Dad, that's my brother's routine!

1671
01:54:59,494 --> 01:55:01,119
Why is your make up not done?

1672
01:55:01,453 --> 01:55:06,369
Mom, I was about to mime too.
He just performed my concept.

1673
01:55:06,453 --> 01:55:07,536
That's all?

1674
01:55:07,703 --> 01:55:09,869
Mommy thought
you had many concepts.

1675
01:55:09,953 --> 01:55:11,328
Can you do only mime?

1676
01:55:11,703 --> 01:55:14,244
If he performed your concept,
you do a different one.

1677
01:55:14,328 --> 01:55:15,744
Daddy, he is crying.

1678
01:55:16,369 --> 01:55:18,953
You have many talents!
Why worry?

1679
01:55:19,244 --> 01:55:19,911
Okay?

1680
01:55:19,953 --> 01:55:21,369
Be happy, and chill.

1681
01:55:23,369 --> 01:55:25,119
Whatever you do, be confident.

1682
01:55:25,161 --> 01:55:27,036
Okay? All the best.

1683
01:55:29,911 --> 01:55:33,911
Next, from Dream Land School,
it's Abhiman.

1684
01:56:23,244 --> 01:56:24,744
Superb!

1685
01:56:24,786 --> 01:56:26,161
He did an amazing job.

1686
01:56:26,536 --> 01:56:29,869
Next up, from Dream Land school,
Kavin!

1687
01:56:29,911 --> 01:56:34,369
He's going to perform a dance number.
Applause!

1688
01:56:35,453 --> 01:56:36,911
Superb, go ahead!

1689
01:57:13,953 --> 01:57:15,036
What happened?

1690
01:57:15,911 --> 01:57:16,953
Sound, please?

1691
01:57:17,619 --> 01:57:18,786
Something wrong with the audio!

1692
01:57:55,536 --> 01:57:57,619
That's my son!

1693
01:58:33,578 --> 01:58:36,203
Wasn't that a lovely performance?

1694
01:58:36,661 --> 01:58:38,119
Great!

1695
01:58:38,846 --> 01:58:44,719
The next student on stage,
is from Dream Land school, Naina!

1696
01:58:44,831 --> 01:58:47,540
Naina, are you going to tell a story?

1697
01:58:48,494 --> 01:58:49,911
Hello, everybody.

1698
01:58:52,453 --> 01:58:56,494
In a beautiful forest,
there was a huge banyan tree.

1699
01:58:56,578 --> 01:58:59,994
Many little sparrows built nests
and lived in it.

1700
01:59:00,539 --> 01:59:06,328
There was a Momma Sparrow,
a Papa Sparrow and a Little Sparrow.

1701
01:59:06,744 --> 01:59:11,078
The Momma and Papa Sparrows
didn't like the Little Sparrow.

1702
01:59:11,119 --> 01:59:17,619
Because the Little Sparrow
wouldn't obey her parents at all.

1703
01:59:17,953 --> 01:59:22,203
Each and every school
kept kicking out the Little Sparrow.

1704
01:59:22,536 --> 01:59:25,953
So, all the other sparrows said…

1705
01:59:26,078 --> 01:59:32,911
"Our Little Sparrow obeys us.
But why won't yours?"

1706
01:59:33,119 --> 01:59:35,911
"So there must be something wrong with it."

1707
01:59:36,017 --> 01:59:39,476
The Momma and Papa Sparrow
went to every doctor.

1708
01:59:39,536 --> 01:59:44,828
But they never found out
what was wrong with the Little Sparrow.

1709
01:59:45,244 --> 01:59:51,119
They had no choice,
so they put the Little Sparrow in a hostel.

1710
01:59:59,911 --> 02:00:01,661
In that hostel…

1711
02:00:01,828 --> 02:00:05,786
Another Little Sparrow became close friends
with the Little Sparrow.

1712
02:00:05,828 --> 02:00:08,494
The other Little Sparrow faced the same problem.

1713
02:00:08,578 --> 02:00:14,661
The two Little Sparrows, made plans,
and flew out of the hostel window!

1714
02:00:14,744 --> 02:00:19,328
That's when a third Little Sparrow
became friends with these two.

1715
02:00:19,494 --> 02:00:22,619
That Little Sparrow's Momma Sparrow
was a teacher.

1716
02:00:23,036 --> 02:00:25,203
The Papa Sparrow was a doctor.

1717
02:00:30,036 --> 02:00:31,661
There also lived…

1718
02:00:31,744 --> 02:00:39,953
A Grandpa Sparrow, a Grandma Sparrow
and a Little Sis Sparrow with them.

1719
02:00:40,078 --> 02:00:44,369
None of them said anything bad
to that Little Sparrow…

1720
02:00:44,411 --> 02:00:50,661
And always said "Think positive",
showered a lot of affection…

1721
02:00:50,786 --> 02:00:54,036
The Little Sparrows lived happily.

1722
02:00:54,119 --> 02:00:57,828
The Doctor Papa Sparrow
and the Teacher Momma Sparrow…

1723
02:00:58,619 --> 02:01:05,744
Started caring for the two Little Sparrows
like their own!

1724
02:01:06,161 --> 02:01:11,703
These two Little Sparrows,
found a home in their nest.

1725
02:01:11,744 --> 02:01:17,494
The two Little Sparrows slowly turned into
obedient children.

1726
02:01:17,578 --> 02:01:24,828
They went to a school meant for
naughty Little Sparrows like them.

1727
02:01:24,968 --> 02:01:32,926
A festival called Talentina
is happening at the school they go to.

1728
02:01:32,953 --> 02:01:36,661
The Little Sparrow that everyone said
had no skills…

1729
02:01:36,661 --> 02:01:40,744
Is standing here before you,
narrating this story.

1730
02:01:40,860 --> 02:01:43,818
Do you like this Little Sparrow's story?

1731
02:01:45,411 --> 02:01:52,411
I beg Momma Sparrow and Papa Sparrow
not to take me away from this nest to a hostel.

1732
02:01:52,544 --> 02:01:55,919
This Little Sparrow will always obey you.

1733
02:02:49,119 --> 02:02:49,828
Naina.

1734
02:02:51,392 --> 02:02:53,142
Look over there,
Miss Vemba is calling...

1735
02:02:54,078 --> 02:02:54,911
Kavin...

1736
02:03:01,911 --> 02:03:03,911
Both of you performed really well.

1737
02:03:03,911 --> 02:03:05,119
Okay, I'm off.

1738
02:03:05,536 --> 02:03:06,744
Why are you leaving?

1739
02:03:07,036 --> 02:03:07,953
It's done!

1740
02:03:08,559 --> 02:03:11,018
Our kids have performed
at such a brilliant stage.

1741
02:03:11,072 --> 02:03:12,197
I'm super happy.

1742
02:03:12,494 --> 02:03:14,953
And they're happy to know
that they are talented.

1743
02:03:15,403 --> 02:03:17,403
That's all I want.
-What about the results?

1744
02:03:17,428 --> 02:03:19,011
All three have performed well.

1745
02:03:19,036 --> 02:03:21,203
Don't you believe in them?

1746
02:03:21,661 --> 02:03:24,203
I believe that every child
who participates must be given a prize.

1747
02:03:25,117 --> 02:03:27,950
The three judges will give prizes
to the kids they liked.

1748
02:03:28,328 --> 02:03:33,203
The kids they like will get
certificates and a bronze cup.

1749
02:03:33,328 --> 02:03:34,744
Let the schools and principals have it.

1750
02:03:34,828 --> 02:03:37,661
We're going horse riding
at the beach.

1751
02:03:37,951 --> 02:03:38,534
See you

1752
02:03:38,559 --> 02:03:41,226
Nothing wrong in knowing
their rank.

1753
02:03:41,411 --> 02:03:44,744
Sir, kids who finished last in games
have ended up as doctors.

1754
02:03:45,078 --> 02:03:47,494
Back benchers have become successful.

1755
02:03:47,961 --> 02:03:51,211
According to me, ranking systems are…
just wrong.

1756
02:03:52,011 --> 02:03:53,719
See you!
Bye.

1757
02:03:53,744 --> 02:03:54,911
Sir!

1758
02:03:55,078 --> 02:03:57,078
Doctor has left.
We should, too.

1759
02:03:58,676 --> 02:03:59,661
Doctor, we're coming too!

1760
02:04:00,619 --> 02:04:02,036
Hi, buddies.

1761
02:04:03,411 --> 02:04:05,328
I'm Sanjay Ramaswamy.

1762
02:04:06,244 --> 02:04:07,658
I'm very happy.

1763
02:04:08,119 --> 02:04:08,786
This…

1764
02:04:08,828 --> 02:04:11,328
Prompt properly, man.
You're ruining everything.

1765
02:04:12,161 --> 02:04:15,036
Come on children. Beach time.
We're going horse riding.

1766
02:04:15,328 --> 02:04:16,036
The beach?

1767
02:04:16,203 --> 02:04:18,911
Why didn't we wait for results, Daddy?

1768
02:04:21,078 --> 02:04:22,744
I'm going to tell you a secret.

1769
02:04:24,453 --> 02:04:26,161
Tadah!

1770
02:04:26,744 --> 02:04:28,119
What's this?
-What's this?

1771
02:04:28,161 --> 02:04:30,494
Enough suspense. Tell us, Dad.

1772
02:04:30,744 --> 02:04:34,328
The three of you are the prize winners
at Talentina.

1773
02:04:35,078 --> 02:04:36,911
Really?
-Yeah!

1774
02:04:37,369 --> 02:04:42,369
I spoke to the judges,
got the medals from them and brought it.

1775
02:04:42,453 --> 02:04:46,244
Why did you bring it, Uncle?
They'd have given it to us on stage!

1776
02:04:46,453 --> 02:04:49,203
Because…
You performed the best.

1777
02:04:49,661 --> 02:04:51,036
They gave you medals.

1778
02:04:51,411 --> 02:04:53,578
So the others?
Did they perform the worst?

1779
02:04:54,078 --> 02:04:56,744
You get medals.
And if they don't?

1780
02:04:56,786 --> 02:04:57,786
They'll feel bad, right?

1781
02:04:58,036 --> 02:05:01,078
Their parents would cry.
The kids would cry, too.

1782
02:05:01,411 --> 02:05:03,203
Then it'd be like some reality show
on T.V.

1783
02:05:03,369 --> 02:05:04,578
Do you want to see that?

1784
02:05:05,036 --> 02:05:07,203
Yes, it's sad for them.
-That's why!

1785
02:05:07,328 --> 02:05:09,328
Okay, let's clap!

1786
02:05:09,786 --> 02:05:11,744
And the best story teller...

1787
02:05:11,911 --> 02:05:14,078
Naina!
-Congrats, Naina.

1788
02:05:15,578 --> 02:05:18,203
And the best dancer award goes to...
Kavin!

1789
02:05:19,911 --> 02:05:23,411
Very good.
-Superb! Superb!

1790
02:05:23,578 --> 02:05:25,119
And the best artist!

1791
02:05:25,453 --> 02:05:27,036
Did you wish him?
-Nice!

1792
02:05:27,453 --> 02:05:29,953
Let's take a picture.
Must record this moment!

1793
02:05:30,119 --> 02:05:31,119
Let's pose together.

1794
02:05:31,661 --> 02:05:32,661
Stand here, Kavin!

1795
02:05:33,111 --> 02:05:36,528
Twenty years down the line,
just say that they won these medals.

1796
02:05:36,553 --> 02:05:37,761
They won't doubt you.

1797
02:05:37,786 --> 02:05:38,744
Come on.
