3
00:02:42,799 --> 00:02:45,359
Kavita.. give me the food.

4
00:02:46,119 --> 00:02:47,199
I am very hungry.

5
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,319
If you wouldn't come here
for some time more..

6
00:02:49,359 --> 00:02:50,839
You wouldn't get the food here.

7
00:02:51,399 --> 00:02:53,279
I would have sent the
food in the dispensary.

8
00:02:54,279 --> 00:02:56,479
You aren't in your senses
once you get a patient.

9
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,439
What have you done to yourself?

10
00:02:59,799 --> 00:03:00,959
What can I do, Kavita?

11
00:03:01,399 --> 00:03:02,806
You know that
I am the only doctor..

12
00:03:02,886 --> 00:03:04,519
In the forty kilometers
stretch here.

13
00:03:05,079 --> 00:03:06,319
Come on, wash your hands.

14
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:11,199
Dammu's mother had come today.

15
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:12,655
Do you know what
she was telling me?

16
00:03:12,679 --> 00:03:13,679
What was she telling you?

17
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:16,679
She was saying that you aren't
human. You are God.

18
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:19,319
Whatever I am, Kavita.

19
00:03:20,399 --> 00:03:21,919
I am all that just because of you.

20
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:23,399
If you weren't there..

21
00:03:23,999 --> 00:03:25,399
Why don't you say like this..

22
00:03:27,279 --> 00:03:30,599
If he wouldn't be,
what would we be?

23
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:33,679
This is the one whom
I am waiting for.

24
00:03:34,359 --> 00:03:35,759
I am counting each day for him.

25
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:41,519
He has sent a letter. It
is just six months left.

26
00:03:42,839 --> 00:03:44,639
Yes, there are six
months left as yet.

27
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:48,839
Come on, let us have the food.

28
00:03:49,279 --> 00:03:51,119
- Did you send the food?
- Yes, I sent it.

29
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:56,319
Doctor..

30
00:03:57,547 --> 00:03:58,623
What happened?

31
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,279
Dukhiya has started vomiting
again, doctor.

32
00:04:01,679 --> 00:04:03,359
Okay, you go. I will
come right away.

33
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:06,759
It isn't in our fate
to eat together.

34
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:09,119
Give me the Tiffin.
I will eat there.

35
00:04:12,012 --> 00:04:13,279
You have your food, okay?

36
00:04:47,719 --> 00:04:48,719
Sakhi..

37
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:50,839
Nine years have passed.

38
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:54,999
But these last six months
are torturous.

39
00:04:55,855 --> 00:04:57,039
I can't pass them at all.

40
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:00,039
Every day seems like a year.

41
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:04,119
I think about it all the time,
when will I meet you?

42
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,519
All of it seems as a dream.

43
00:05:08,003 --> 00:05:09,399
Do you remember how we met?

44
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:11,439
It is just yesterday's matter.

45
00:05:11,679 --> 00:05:13,519
Prashant and me had
gone to Kashmir..

46
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:15,959
After completing our doctorate
for our holidays.

47
00:05:24,159 --> 00:05:25,359
Do you know, Sudhir?

48
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:27,879
Almost all the hill
stations of India..

49
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:29,599
Have been discovered
by the British.

50
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:31,879
But Kashmir is the discovery
of the Mughals.

51
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,039
- Is it so?
- Yes.

52
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,159
Jehangir was correct.

53
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,679
If there is heaven somewhere,
it is here.

54
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:42,519
Yes. This is correct.

55
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:44,439
But tell me.

56
00:05:45,119 --> 00:05:46,719
Why this lake is called
the Dal lake?

57
00:05:46,799 --> 00:05:48,799
I haven't seen any more interesting
lake than this.

58
00:05:50,799 --> 00:05:52,639
Wow.. interesting.

59
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:55,999
It has the tresses of Bengal
and Punjabi girls too.

60
00:05:56,239 --> 00:05:58,119
Hey, have you come here
to look at the girls?

61
00:05:58,279 --> 00:05:59,279
No..

62
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,879
I have become
a child specialist.

63
00:06:02,719 --> 00:06:05,999
All of them will be the mothers
of my patients one day.

64
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:08,879
But Mr. Chaturvedi.

65
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,959
You have become a gynecologist.

66
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:13,359
Then, why are you gazing
at these mountains?

67
00:06:13,799 --> 00:06:16,279
- Come on, come to your real profession.
- You too!

68
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:27,639
Wow.. come on,
we will see your diagnosis.

69
00:06:28,799 --> 00:06:30,399
Tell me. From where will she be?

70
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:32,999
She must be from Gujarat.

71
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:36,239
Gujarat? No. She cannot
be from there.

72
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:37,399
Why?

73
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:40,519
If a girl has such a
intoxicating gait..

74
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:43,959
She cannot be from such a state
which is under prohibition.

75
00:06:44,918 --> 00:06:47,239
I think
that she is from UP or Bihar.

76
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:50,359
She has such a soft face.

77
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:52,839
She cannot be from anywhere
else, except Gujarat.

78
00:06:53,119 --> 00:06:54,415
Shall we bet a hundred
rupees on that?

79
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:55,479
Okay, come on.

80
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:57,399
But how shall we decide?

81
00:06:57,879 --> 00:06:58,679
I will ask her.

82
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:00,959
Are you mad? Do you want
us to be beaten up?

83
00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:04,199
She can embrace us too.

84
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,079
I am going to ask.

85
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:07,999
You wait for me here.

86
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:09,719
Sudhir..

87
00:07:18,159 --> 00:07:19,839
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

88
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:21,679
Can I have a seat?

89
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:23,479
Please sit.

90
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:29,519
Have you come here for a stroll?

91
00:07:30,119 --> 00:07:32,159
I ask stupid questions too.

92
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:33,415
If a person doesn't come
for a stroll here..

93
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:34,999
Will they come here
to play football?

94
00:07:36,239 --> 00:07:38,319
Like that.. where do you stay?

95
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:42,319
See.. see. Please don't
misunderstand me.

96
00:07:42,559 --> 00:07:44,279
I am a doctor. Dr. Sudhir Rai.

97
00:07:45,359 --> 00:07:47,759
I work in the children's ward
of a hospital in Bombay.

98
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:48,919
And him..

99
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:51,519
The one who turned away..

100
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:54,399
He is my friend. Dr.
Prakash Chaturvedi.

101
00:07:54,719 --> 00:07:55,839
He is a gynecologist.

102
00:07:56,359 --> 00:07:58,879
Actually, we have placed a bet.

103
00:07:58,999 --> 00:07:59,999
For hundred rupees.

104
00:08:00,359 --> 00:08:02,039
And I say that you are
from U.P. Or Bihar.

105
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:03,535
He says that you are from Gujarat.

106
00:08:03,559 --> 00:08:05,199
Please tell me, whom
out of us is correct?

107
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:08,839
Both of you are wrong.
I am from Maharashtra.

108
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:10,599
Oh no!

109
00:08:11,359 --> 00:08:12,935
We will never be successful
in our profession.

110
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,359
Such a wrong diagnosis?

111
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:19,119
How can you compare Gujarat,
UP and Maharashtra?

112
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,439
You don't have to
be so disappointed.

113
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,799
A little bit of your
diagnosis is correct.

114
00:08:24,359 --> 00:08:25,359
How is that?

115
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:27,599
Actually, we started
staying in Khandala..

116
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:30,399
After father retired. Like that..

117
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,679
Two of our generations
has been staying in UP.

118
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,519
Then, you are from UP.

119
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:35,599
Wow.. I'm a great.

120
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,239
Hey, Prakash.. come
here.. come here.

121
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:39,958
Yes, come here!

122
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:43,999
See. I have been introduced, but
you didn't introduce yourself.

123
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:46,319
My name is Kavita Goyal.

124
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:47,959
See, come.

125
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:50,799
- She is Kavita Goyal.
- Greetings.

126
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:52,759
She stays in UP.

127
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:55,719
- Give me hundred rupees.
- Don't give it to him.

128
00:08:56,999 --> 00:08:59,079
We stayed two
generations ago in UP.

129
00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:02,455
Okay. If not hundred rupees, ten
rupees is the proper amount.

130
00:09:02,479 --> 00:09:04,039
- Give it to me.
- Okay, take it.

131
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:05,719
Cash, right now.

132
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:07,519
Okay.

133
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:09,959
- Come on, quickly.
- Yes, have some patience.

134
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:13,919
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

135
00:09:14,599 --> 00:09:16,519
I am Dr. Sudhir Rai
child specialist.

136
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:19,079
And he is Dr. Prakash Chaturvedi
gynecologist.

137
00:09:19,199 --> 00:09:20,639
And she is Miss Kavita Goyal.

138
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:23,199
And he is Dr. Ram Narayan
Goyal, my father.

139
00:09:24,199 --> 00:09:25,199
I am sorry.

140
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:26,719
Are you a doctor too?

141
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:29,279
But not a doctor like you.

142
00:09:29,359 --> 00:09:31,159
I am a doctor of literature.

143
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,279
Oh God!

144
00:09:32,599 --> 00:09:33,399
Why?

145
00:09:33,479 --> 00:09:35,359
This is one subject
that I am scared of.

146
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:38,255
You are scared of just
the subject, isn't it?

147
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:39,959
You don't have to be scared of me.

148
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:41,935
From where you people have come?

149
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:43,599
- We have come from Bombay.
- Okay.

150
00:09:44,479 --> 00:09:46,519
We have to go to Pehelgam.

151
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:48,215
Yes, even we are just
leaving for Sonmat.

152
00:09:48,239 --> 00:09:51,159
- Okay. Come on, child.
- Farewell.. - Farewell.

153
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:56,919
Come on, Sudhir. Let us arrange..

154
00:09:57,319 --> 00:09:58,679
For a car to go to Sonmat.

155
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:00,559
Who will go to Sonmat now,
you fool?

156
00:10:00,719 --> 00:10:01,719
Why?

157
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:04,719
Pehelgam.. we will go to Pehelgam.

158
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:07,439
But have just stayed
there for seven days.

159
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:14,679
Okay, she is going, therefore.

160
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:16,599
You have a bright future.

161
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:18,919
You have diagnosed correctly
for the first time.

162
00:10:30,199 --> 00:10:31,771
Please wait here. We
will come right away.

163
00:10:31,795 --> 00:10:32,795
Come on, Prashant.

164
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:48,559
- Greetings, Miss Kavita.
- Greetings.

165
00:10:49,599 --> 00:10:53,519
You? You people were about
to go to Sonmat, isn't it?

166
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:57,039
Yes, but Prashant said that
we must go to Sonmat first.

167
00:10:57,599 --> 00:10:58,919
What did you say, Prashant?

168
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:01,319
Yes. We will go to Pehelgam
and then everything else.

169
00:11:01,479 --> 00:11:02,359
He writes poetry, therefore..

170
00:11:02,439 --> 00:11:05,079
We thought that we will
see Pehelgam too.

171
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:07,639
- Please listen.
- Yes?

172
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,079
Please call my father and..

173
00:11:09,199 --> 00:11:10,839
- Two cups of tea for them..
- Okay.

174
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:12,759
Have you come back, sir?

175
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:17,799
Yes, so what if we have come back?
You please go and bring the tea.

176
00:11:19,239 --> 00:11:20,319
Can we have a seat?

177
00:11:21,119 --> 00:11:22,119
Yes, please sit.

178
00:11:22,439 --> 00:11:23,959
Come on, Prashant. Have a seat.

179
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:29,199
This means that you have
come here earlier too?

180
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:35,359
Did you see that, Prashant?

181
00:11:35,439 --> 00:11:36,735
Therefore, I tell you.
You shouldn't lie.

182
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:38,199
When do you speak the truth?

183
00:11:39,719 --> 00:11:40,719
Yes. This is correct too.

184
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:43,199
Okay, Miss Kavita,
don't you think..

185
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,879
That Pehelgam is a place where
a person should come repeatedly?

186
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,079
Yes.

187
00:11:47,818 --> 00:11:49,458
- You are right.
- Therefore.. therefore..

188
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:50,799
Do you know one thing?

189
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:52,479
Prashant. You don't know it.
Listen to it.

190
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:54,365
The Britisher's have discovered..

191
00:11:54,525 --> 00:11:55,965
All the hill stations in India.

192
00:11:56,085 --> 00:11:58,285
It is only Kashmir, which was
discovered by the Mughals.

193
00:11:58,405 --> 00:11:59,805
- Really!
- Yes, keep in mind.

194
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:02,805
The Mughals cannot
be compared at all.

195
00:12:03,445 --> 00:12:08,045
Look at their paintings and art.

196
00:12:08,565 --> 00:12:11,565
But you forgot the greatest
contribution of the Mughals.

197
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:14,005
What is that?

198
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:15,605
Mughlai food.

199
00:12:17,525 --> 00:12:20,765
Madam.. madam..
Please come, sir seems unwell.

200
00:12:21,445 --> 00:12:22,645
Come on. We will see.

201
00:12:23,965 --> 00:12:25,125
Please don't worry.

202
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:27,045
You just need some rest.

203
00:12:27,885 --> 00:12:29,765
We will not let you travel
for seven days now.

204
00:12:30,045 --> 00:12:33,405
Seven days? Then it
will be a problem.

205
00:12:34,645 --> 00:12:38,605
Kavita has her first radio
program on the 17th.

206
00:12:39,085 --> 00:12:41,405
Please don't speak like children.
I will write a letter.

207
00:12:42,005 --> 00:12:45,645
Listen.. do you speak on
the radio or something?

208
00:12:46,285 --> 00:12:49,405
She doesn't orate. She sings.

209
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:51,125
Is it?

210
00:12:52,085 --> 00:12:53,765
Your daughter is
very talented then.

211
00:12:55,365 --> 00:12:57,805
But, I am a great father too.

212
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,805
I ruined her holidays
by falling ill.

213
00:13:01,885 --> 00:13:03,765
She will not be able
to roam around too.

214
00:13:04,645 --> 00:13:07,085
Why will she be not be
able to roam around?

215
00:13:07,725 --> 00:13:10,165
When I will sit and
blabber with you..

216
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:12,141
Prashant will go and
move around with her.

217
00:13:12,165 --> 00:13:13,765
And when Prashant
will sit with you..

218
00:13:13,845 --> 00:13:14,965
I will go around with her.

219
00:13:15,149 --> 00:13:17,181
Then, when you will get well, all of
us will go around together.

220
00:13:17,205 --> 00:13:21,005
- How is my cure?
- Your suggestion is very good.

221
00:13:30,085 --> 00:13:31,085
Really.

222
00:13:31,565 --> 00:13:33,285
It is god's grace
that we met you.

223
00:13:34,165 --> 00:13:36,885
Or else, father's illness
in a foreign country.

224
00:13:37,445 --> 00:13:39,005
I don't know what
I would have done.

225
00:13:39,165 --> 00:13:40,845
No. He didn't have any
special illness.

226
00:13:41,325 --> 00:13:44,085
Or, I wouldn't have left
him and came with you.

227
00:13:45,205 --> 00:13:46,725
And then, we live in a society.

228
00:13:47,525 --> 00:13:49,445
You get someone or
the other for help.

229
00:13:49,885 --> 00:13:50,765
Yes.

230
00:13:50,845 --> 00:13:54,645
But for that someone
to be a doctor..

231
00:13:55,525 --> 00:13:58,925
And leaving all their work,
coming for help in trouble..

232
00:13:59,045 --> 00:14:00,205
Miss Kavita..

233
00:14:01,245 --> 00:14:02,445
Time is the turning point..

234
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:07,445
In which one stranger
coming from one side..

235
00:14:08,165 --> 00:14:11,405
Sees the other stranger coming
from the other side and stops..

236
00:14:12,405 --> 00:14:13,845
And starts thinking that..

237
00:14:14,765 --> 00:14:18,845
We have met somewhere at
some point of time.

238
00:14:20,005 --> 00:14:21,005
Hey..

239
00:14:21,325 --> 00:14:24,205
You are a poet. How did
you become a doctor?

240
00:14:24,885 --> 00:14:25,885
Yes.

241
00:14:26,045 --> 00:14:28,005
Sudhir and I studied together.

242
00:14:28,645 --> 00:14:30,925
He wanted to be a doctor.
Therefore, I too..

243
00:14:31,565 --> 00:14:33,205
You are very fast friends.

244
00:14:33,485 --> 00:14:36,125
Oh, just like some
religious story..

245
00:14:36,405 --> 00:14:38,525
The people call us Lord
Ram and Lord Lakshman.

246
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:41,565
Do you write poetry like
Mr. Prakash?

247
00:14:42,205 --> 00:14:43,205
Poetry?

248
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,405
Okay. So he has started reciting..

249
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:48,325
Poetry to you as soon
as he got a chance?

250
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:49,805
So what?

251
00:14:51,525 --> 00:14:54,605
He wrote such a nice poetry
about 'Dal-Lake'.

252
00:14:57,125 --> 00:15:00,165
The moon comes here secretly.

253
00:15:01,925 --> 00:15:03,245
And in this lake..

254
00:15:03,805 --> 00:15:07,885
People spit, and clean
their clothes.

255
00:15:09,365 --> 00:15:11,708
See, Miss. Kavita.
Your name is Kavita.

256
00:15:11,788 --> 00:15:13,628
Therefore, I won't say anything
against poetry.

257
00:15:13,965 --> 00:15:17,485
But the truth is, nobody has
seen the feet of the moon.

258
00:15:18,285 --> 00:15:20,485
So, I don't know how it
can come here secretly.

259
00:15:21,085 --> 00:15:23,125
But it is just a phrase, a concept.

260
00:15:24,285 --> 00:15:26,405
If giving a false phrase
makes a poem, okay.

261
00:15:27,525 --> 00:15:33,125
Far away, at the
deserted shore stands..

262
00:15:34,205 --> 00:15:41,125
A tattered old tree
adjoining a young one.

263
00:15:42,365 --> 00:15:47,928
Having seen centuries of loneliness,
it whispers to the young tree.

264
00:15:48,915 --> 00:15:53,645
It is all silence and solitude.

265
00:15:54,525 --> 00:15:55,765
Talk something.

266
00:16:01,525 --> 00:16:03,405
Excuse me, but I don't
like to read poetry.

267
00:16:03,845 --> 00:16:05,405
You don't like to listen to it too?

268
00:16:05,845 --> 00:16:08,205
I don't understand at all
where the question of likings is?

269
00:16:09,405 --> 00:16:10,941
Can I tell you something?
You won't feel bad?

270
00:16:10,965 --> 00:16:12,005
Tell me.

271
00:16:15,205 --> 00:16:16,205
Tell me.

272
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:19,645
I don't like to
read or hear poetry.

273
00:16:20,765 --> 00:16:22,765
But I like to see poetry.

274
00:16:29,645 --> 00:16:31,661
See, it seems that I will
be boring you pretty soon.

275
00:16:31,685 --> 00:16:33,165
Therefore, I will stop my blabber..

276
00:16:33,245 --> 00:16:34,445
So there should be a song..

277
00:16:35,085 --> 00:16:36,085
- Sing?
- Yes.

278
00:16:36,685 --> 00:16:39,365
It is the 17th today.
It was your program in radio too.

279
00:16:40,245 --> 00:16:43,085
- Therefore..
- But.. a song here?

280
00:16:43,285 --> 00:16:45,925
Yes, you can sing between
four walls..

281
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,165
And you cannot sing here?

282
00:16:47,525 --> 00:16:49,685
Yes the only difference is that
there is a microphone..

283
00:16:51,325 --> 00:16:52,325
And here..

284
00:16:53,005 --> 00:16:54,725
The microphone is standing
in your presence.

285
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:13,125
"Whom does your mind search..
While traveling, o breeze.."

286
00:17:23,805 --> 00:17:31,805
"Whom does your mind search..
While traveling, o breeze.."

287
00:17:34,485 --> 00:17:42,485
"Whom does your mind search..
While traveling, o breeze.."

288
00:17:44,005 --> 00:17:52,005
"You wander around..
Who is your beloved?"

289
00:17:55,085 --> 00:18:03,085
"Whom does your mind search..
While traveling, o breeze.."

290
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:35,125
"What is your relation
with the cloud?"

291
00:18:37,565 --> 00:18:45,565
"What is your relation
with the cloud?"

292
00:18:47,885 --> 00:18:52,725
"Why do you dance and sing?"

293
00:18:53,045 --> 00:18:57,965
"Why do you dance and sing?"

294
00:18:58,365 --> 00:19:02,165
"When the monsoon arrives?"

295
00:19:02,365 --> 00:19:10,365
"You wander around..
Who is your beloved?"

296
00:19:13,205 --> 00:19:21,205
"Whom does your mind search..
While traveling, o breeze.."

297
00:19:44,325 --> 00:19:49,085
"A lone.. you.."

298
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:53,165
"My friend.. you.."

299
00:19:54,565 --> 00:19:59,405
"A lone.. you.."

300
00:19:59,685 --> 00:20:04,205
"My friend.. you.."

301
00:20:04,605 --> 00:20:09,445
"The one who isn't befriended
by anyone.."

302
00:20:09,685 --> 00:20:14,885
"The one who isn't befriended
by anyone.."

303
00:20:14,965 --> 00:20:19,005
"You are her friend.."

304
00:20:19,085 --> 00:20:27,085
"You wander around..
Who is your beloved?"

305
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:37,645
"Whom does your mind search..
While traveling, o breeze.."

306
00:20:40,045 --> 00:20:48,045
"Whom does your mind search..
While traveling, o breeze.."

307
00:20:54,485 --> 00:20:55,485
Hey, Prashant..

308
00:20:57,205 --> 00:20:58,205
What are you writing?

309
00:20:58,325 --> 00:21:00,605
I was just looking at
the photos developed.

310
00:21:00,685 --> 00:21:03,005
Look at the photos later. First,
go and do the packing.

311
00:21:03,525 --> 00:21:04,525
Yes, okay.

312
00:21:20,525 --> 00:21:23,245
Miss Kavita, time is
the moment that..

313
00:21:51,645 --> 00:21:54,525
Oh brother.. quickly..
Uncle is waiting.

314
00:21:55,405 --> 00:21:57,685
Look at this. The magic
of our tailor.

315
00:21:58,205 --> 00:21:59,525
Is this a shirt or a tent?

316
00:22:00,347 --> 00:22:02,827
This tent belongs to this tall man.
Did you not see it before?

317
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,387
Oh.. is it your shirt?

318
00:22:04,467 --> 00:22:06,867
Your heart beats are rising
before reaching Khandala?

319
00:22:07,187 --> 00:22:08,987
Control you heart.

320
00:22:09,691 --> 00:22:12,011
As it is, it isn't your mistake.
She is like that only.

321
00:22:13,171 --> 00:22:15,371
What about you? Anyone who
sees, will be stunned.

322
00:22:15,651 --> 00:22:18,811
Very good, God has made
such a beautiful thing.

323
00:22:20,651 --> 00:22:22,331
Come on, you get ready.
I will leave.

324
00:22:31,691 --> 00:22:32,691
Morning, uncle.

325
00:22:32,891 --> 00:22:35,011
Come, Ramlal. Did you read
the newspaper today?

326
00:22:35,211 --> 00:22:37,187
- The prime minister has written..
- Did you take the medicine?

327
00:22:37,211 --> 00:22:38,411
Listen to it at least..

328
00:22:38,531 --> 00:22:39,451
He has said..

329
00:22:39,531 --> 00:22:40,891
If you take the medicine on time..

330
00:22:40,931 --> 00:22:42,651
The blood pressure will
be under control.

331
00:22:42,811 --> 00:22:44,251
- Give it to me.
- Here.

332
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:47,371
Raghu.. hey Raghu..
Give me the breakfast.

333
00:22:49,251 --> 00:22:50,411
Where is Chagganlal?

334
00:22:50,891 --> 00:22:52,011
He is getting ready.

335
00:22:53,011 --> 00:22:55,611
What is the matter?
You seem dressed up too.

336
00:22:56,411 --> 00:22:58,131
What is the program so
early in the morning?

337
00:22:58,451 --> 00:23:01,251
We wished to go to Khandala.

338
00:23:01,611 --> 00:23:03,691
That Mr. Goyal is
not well, isn't it?

339
00:23:04,371 --> 00:23:05,371
Mr. Goyal?

340
00:23:05,491 --> 00:23:07,251
I have heard that
Mr. Goyal is all right now.

341
00:23:07,291 --> 00:23:09,531
Yes.. it is all right.

342
00:23:10,531 --> 00:23:13,171
Khandala is a nice place
for the health, isn't it?

343
00:23:13,651 --> 00:23:15,251
Yes. There is no pollution there.

344
00:23:15,651 --> 00:23:17,411
The air is fresh and
the water there..

345
00:23:17,491 --> 00:23:19,091
What is the name of
Mr. Goyal's daughter?

346
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:20,131
Sita or Urmila?

347
00:23:21,211 --> 00:23:21,771
Yes?

348
00:23:21,851 --> 00:23:24,611
Tell me. Who likes Khandala more?

349
00:23:24,811 --> 00:23:26,547
- You or Prashant?
- Prashant, Prashant, uncle.

350
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:28,771
Okay. Then the girl's
name is Urmila.

351
00:23:30,131 --> 00:23:31,811
Urmila or Kavita,
it is all the same.

352
00:23:32,731 --> 00:23:33,611
We are caught isn't it?

353
00:23:33,691 --> 00:23:35,211
We knew that we will be
caught one day.

354
00:23:35,931 --> 00:23:37,491
After all, how long can we fool..

355
00:23:37,571 --> 00:23:39,131
An experienced magistrate
like you?

356
00:23:39,291 --> 00:23:40,611
We are children in your presence.

357
00:23:42,211 --> 00:23:44,291
See, Sudhir. Prashant has
searched his Urmila.

358
00:23:44,971 --> 00:23:46,451
Now, you search for your Sita too.

359
00:23:47,011 --> 00:23:48,931
And marry off quickly.

360
00:23:49,491 --> 00:23:51,611
Then you go to study to America.

361
00:23:52,291 --> 00:23:53,931
I will stay here nicely after that.

362
00:23:54,331 --> 00:23:55,811
Two daughter-in-laws will serve me.

363
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:59,491
I am not in a hurry to
search for my Sita.

364
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:01,371
- Because I am not going to America.
- Why?

365
00:24:01,891 --> 00:24:02,931
That same matter.

366
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:05,411
You know that I have become
a child specialist.

367
00:24:05,891 --> 00:24:07,171
What will I go doing there?

368
00:24:07,371 --> 00:24:08,747
The problems of
the children there..

369
00:24:08,771 --> 00:24:10,531
Are over nutrition,
over medication..

370
00:24:10,731 --> 00:24:12,891
Over eating, the problem
is there in this country.

371
00:24:13,331 --> 00:24:14,771
Children don't
get proper food here.

372
00:24:14,971 --> 00:24:16,267
Prashant wants to become
a gynecologist.

373
00:24:16,291 --> 00:24:17,131
Let him go to America..

374
00:24:17,211 --> 00:24:18,771
- Sudhir, I want that..
- Uncle..

375
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:21,211
I am the judge
of the supreme court.

376
00:24:21,651 --> 00:24:23,571
The judgment that I have
given is the final.

377
00:24:23,811 --> 00:24:24,811
The end.

378
00:24:25,171 --> 00:24:26,611
I will not be leaving you alone.

379
00:24:28,691 --> 00:24:29,851
Come on, have your breakfast.

380
00:24:31,891 --> 00:24:34,371
Kavita is twenty seven
years old, Ramnarayan.

381
00:24:34,971 --> 00:24:36,451
At least have this bit of a worry.

382
00:24:36,811 --> 00:24:38,371
She is a young girl.

383
00:24:38,771 --> 00:24:43,491
She is moving around, smiling and
laughing with two young boys.

384
00:24:43,571 --> 00:24:44,891
Let her move around, sister.

385
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:47,571
Prashant and Sudhir
are not any wastrels.

386
00:24:47,651 --> 00:24:48,667
That I should worry about them.

387
00:24:48,691 --> 00:24:50,491
I haven't seen a father like you.

388
00:24:50,651 --> 00:24:52,051
Even lice don't move on your hair.

389
00:24:52,451 --> 00:24:53,451
Lice?

390
00:24:53,971 --> 00:24:56,531
How will lice be formed?
I don't have hair at all.

391
00:24:58,971 --> 00:25:01,451
You tell me. Whom do you
like from the two?

392
00:25:01,771 --> 00:25:03,131
What is there to like in them?

393
00:25:03,531 --> 00:25:05,771
Sudhir has been reared
by Prashant's father.

394
00:25:06,291 --> 00:25:08,571
He isn't a son or any relative.

395
00:25:09,051 --> 00:25:10,451
Prashant is alone son.

396
00:25:12,131 --> 00:25:13,491
Please come.

397
00:25:17,771 --> 00:25:18,971
Where is Doctor Sudhir?

398
00:25:19,411 --> 00:25:20,891
Both of us were coming here.

399
00:25:20,971 --> 00:25:22,731
On the way, a child
came under a truck.

400
00:25:23,931 --> 00:25:25,251
Is he hurt seriously?

401
00:25:25,931 --> 00:25:29,011
He has been hurt seriously. Sudhir
took him to the hospital.

402
00:25:29,451 --> 00:25:30,491
And I came here.

403
00:25:31,851 --> 00:25:33,411
I wished to speak to you.

404
00:25:35,131 --> 00:25:36,211
Where is uncle?

405
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:39,131
Sudhir liked CHIKIS a lot,
isn't it?

406
00:25:39,411 --> 00:25:41,091
Therefore, he went to get it.

407
00:25:41,211 --> 00:25:42,211
Okay.

408
00:25:45,091 --> 00:25:47,891
I don't know.. how to say all this.

409
00:25:49,051 --> 00:25:50,571
I am going to America
after a few days.

410
00:25:50,611 --> 00:25:51,691
For higher studies.

411
00:25:52,771 --> 00:25:55,571
I wish that before I leave,
we should get married.

412
00:25:58,051 --> 00:26:01,051
I know that you must be stunned
because I spoke about this suddenly.

413
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:03,411
I know what you think about it.

414
00:26:03,731 --> 00:26:06,211
You just say yes, and
I will speak to father.

415
00:26:07,571 --> 00:26:09,011
- But..
- No ifs and buts.

416
00:26:09,091 --> 00:26:10,211
I can tell you..

417
00:26:10,291 --> 00:26:11,851
You won't be going to some fool.

418
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:13,811
A husband like Sudhir..

419
00:26:14,011 --> 00:26:16,331
A friend like Sudhir.. Only very
fortunate people get such.

420
00:26:16,571 --> 00:26:19,051
He is true gold, Miss.
Kavita. True gold.

421
00:26:20,171 --> 00:26:21,291
- Then?
- Then what!

422
00:26:21,771 --> 00:26:24,331
Dr. Mathur has cut both his legs.
He will be saved now.

423
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:27,811
If I was in place of Dr. Mathur..

424
00:26:28,811 --> 00:26:31,211
I would have killed that child
on the operation table itself.

425
00:26:31,731 --> 00:26:32,731
What?

426
00:26:33,011 --> 00:26:34,411
Being a doctor..

427
00:26:34,571 --> 00:26:35,571
I am right.

428
00:26:36,411 --> 00:26:37,891
He is the son of a poor man.

429
00:26:38,531 --> 00:26:40,331
A poor man cannot
live with two legs.

430
00:26:40,851 --> 00:26:42,491
How will be able to survive
with two legs?

431
00:26:42,691 --> 00:26:45,211
Whether they are rich or poor..

432
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:47,531
The life is the same
for both, isn't it?

433
00:26:47,611 --> 00:26:48,811
No, Miss Goyal.

434
00:26:50,731 --> 00:26:53,451
When a rich person dies, they
leave happiness behind them.

435
00:26:55,171 --> 00:26:56,531
But when a poor man dies..

436
00:26:57,491 --> 00:26:58,811
They leave behind sadness.

437
00:26:59,931 --> 00:27:01,571
If someone doesn't
know you closely..

438
00:27:01,931 --> 00:27:04,251
They will think,
you are so harsh!

439
00:27:05,251 --> 00:27:08,691
How will I become harsh?

440
00:27:09,571 --> 00:27:10,771
You are the harsh one.

441
00:27:11,371 --> 00:27:12,491
- Me?
- What else?

442
00:27:13,091 --> 00:27:14,851
A poor man is dying in your love.

443
00:27:15,211 --> 00:27:16,931
And you don't worry
about him at all.

444
00:27:17,491 --> 00:27:19,931
Listen, Miss Kavita.
Tell me clearly.

445
00:27:20,531 --> 00:27:22,451
Are you ready to marry, or not?

446
00:27:23,451 --> 00:27:25,051
See, where will you get such a boy?

447
00:27:25,291 --> 00:27:27,731
He is a doctor. He doesn't
smoke or drink.

448
00:27:28,211 --> 00:27:29,531
He is the only son of his father.

449
00:27:29,571 --> 00:27:31,291
He is going to America
for higher studies.

450
00:27:31,371 --> 00:27:32,891
Whom are you talking about?

451
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:34,851
About Prashant, who else?

452
00:27:35,371 --> 00:27:37,371
He is going to a foreign
country for studies.

453
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:38,747
What if he fails in
his examination..

454
00:27:38,771 --> 00:27:40,131
In the pain of your love?

455
00:27:42,531 --> 00:27:43,731
You are strange people.

456
00:27:44,811 --> 00:27:47,371
You are recommending him today.

457
00:27:48,611 --> 00:27:50,691
Yesterday, he was recommending you.

458
00:27:51,811 --> 00:27:53,171
- Recommending me?
- Yes.

459
00:27:57,451 --> 00:27:59,091
Okay. I understand.

460
00:27:59,571 --> 00:28:00,971
He must have got
the guts to speak..

461
00:28:01,051 --> 00:28:03,691
About his marriage, therefore
he spoke about me.

462
00:28:03,771 --> 00:28:06,651
But, Madam. Prashant
knows this very well.

463
00:28:07,931 --> 00:28:10,131
On medical grounds..
I cannot marry.

464
00:28:12,451 --> 00:28:13,691
I have a elder brother..

465
00:28:14,778 --> 00:28:15,778
Who is crazy.

466
00:28:17,211 --> 00:28:20,251
I have another matter,
I am telling it just to you.

467
00:28:21,651 --> 00:28:23,691
I have an affair with a girl.

468
00:28:25,891 --> 00:28:27,771
Is there any other secret
in your life?

469
00:28:32,291 --> 00:28:33,291
Yes.

470
00:28:34,571 --> 00:28:37,211
You will get my name in the
police records even today.

471
00:28:38,571 --> 00:28:40,051
I have a criminal back ground.

472
00:28:41,451 --> 00:28:42,571
Will you want to hear it?

473
00:28:43,571 --> 00:28:44,691
Will you be able to hear it?

474
00:28:45,651 --> 00:28:46,691
Hear.

475
00:28:48,371 --> 00:28:50,491
Because I haven't been able
to tell anyone till today.

476
00:28:50,771 --> 00:28:51,891
My heart is heavy.

477
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:54,691
Maybe, if I tell you,
I will be satisfied.

478
00:28:55,891 --> 00:28:56,891
Tell it.

479
00:28:57,811 --> 00:28:58,851
Then come outside.

480
00:28:59,971 --> 00:29:01,291
The story is very big.

481
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:03,891
This room will be small.

482
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:11,638
I lost my mother in my childhood.

483
00:29:13,038 --> 00:29:14,718
Father was a teacher in the school.

484
00:29:15,635 --> 00:29:17,275
There were just three
beings in the house.

485
00:29:17,398 --> 00:29:19,078
Father, brother and me.

486
00:29:20,398 --> 00:29:21,918
Even then the house couldn't run.

487
00:29:23,438 --> 00:29:25,198
We used to get food
only once in a day.

488
00:29:25,878 --> 00:29:27,094
If we got food in the day, we
wouldn't get it in the night.

489
00:29:27,118 --> 00:29:29,358
If we got it in the night, we
wouldn't get it in the day.

490
00:29:30,478 --> 00:29:31,958
Brother was a very good student.

491
00:29:32,958 --> 00:29:34,238
Father was hoping that..

492
00:29:34,318 --> 00:29:37,838
Brother will change our
times after his MA.

493
00:29:39,838 --> 00:29:40,838
In those days..

494
00:29:41,918 --> 00:29:43,878
There was a new district
magistrate in the city.

495
00:29:45,598 --> 00:29:47,078
His son came in my class.

496
00:29:48,238 --> 00:29:50,598
My father was employed to give
him private tuitions at home.

497
00:29:51,598 --> 00:29:55,078
Father took the permission to
take me along with him..

498
00:29:55,718 --> 00:29:57,558
So that I could be educated
with him too.

499
00:29:58,918 --> 00:30:00,118
He was a magistrate.

500
00:30:00,838 --> 00:30:01,878
Greetings, teacher.

501
00:30:02,558 --> 00:30:03,318
Greetings.

502
00:30:03,398 --> 00:30:05,758
Why did you stand up? Sit down.

503
00:30:10,998 --> 00:30:12,158
Son, look here.

504
00:30:14,158 --> 00:30:16,038
A new life started for
me from that day.

505
00:30:17,078 --> 00:30:18,758
I wasn't interested in studies.

506
00:30:19,958 --> 00:30:21,758
I just used to wait
for six o' clock.

507
00:30:22,718 --> 00:30:25,918
When mother used to
bring the snacks.

508
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:28,158
Here you are.

509
00:30:28,358 --> 00:30:29,758
What is the need for this everyday?

510
00:30:29,838 --> 00:30:30,838
So what?

511
00:30:33,118 --> 00:30:34,158
Have it.

512
00:30:35,678 --> 00:30:36,678
Here..

513
00:30:38,358 --> 00:30:39,358
Here..

514
00:30:40,318 --> 00:30:42,078
- Okay, I will get some water.
- Okay.

515
00:30:43,718 --> 00:30:45,678
But while I ate the snacks,
I used..

516
00:30:46,238 --> 00:30:48,118
To have a strange
hatred towards them.

517
00:30:49,318 --> 00:30:51,198
Why was there such a difference
between us?

518
00:30:51,958 --> 00:30:54,998
Why does Prashant go wearing a
clean shirt in a car to school?

519
00:30:55,398 --> 00:30:57,718
When I just go in my slippers
and a torn shirt.

520
00:30:59,478 --> 00:31:01,038
In that jealousy, one day..

521
00:31:01,238 --> 00:31:02,958
I stole Prashant's homework book.

522
00:31:03,238 --> 00:31:04,494
Forty eight thousand divided by..

523
00:31:04,518 --> 00:31:06,318
Two will come out to
twenty four thousand..

524
00:31:06,918 --> 00:31:10,078
And here, ninety eight
thousand multiplied by..

525
00:31:11,398 --> 00:31:12,558
- Okay?
- Understood.

526
00:31:16,518 --> 00:31:17,518
Have a seat.

527
00:31:18,158 --> 00:31:19,998
Get the homework books one by one.

528
00:31:20,758 --> 00:31:21,758
Prashant?

529
00:31:23,758 --> 00:31:24,758
What happened?

530
00:31:25,838 --> 00:31:27,238
I am not finding the book, sir.

531
00:31:27,558 --> 00:31:29,678
This means that you didn't
do your homework.

532
00:31:30,238 --> 00:31:30,918
I did it, sir.

533
00:31:30,998 --> 00:31:31,998
Shut up.

534
00:31:32,038 --> 00:31:33,134
First if all, you didn't
do the homework..

535
00:31:33,158 --> 00:31:35,238
And you lie on top of that?
Stand up on the bench.

536
00:31:35,318 --> 00:31:36,318
Stand up!

537
00:31:56,118 --> 00:31:57,118
Sudhir..

538
00:32:03,518 --> 00:32:04,518
What is it?

539
00:32:24,078 --> 00:32:24,958
Here.

540
00:32:25,038 --> 00:32:26,998
Hit me, hit me
as much as you want.

541
00:32:27,398 --> 00:32:28,878
But please don't tell it to father.

542
00:32:29,078 --> 00:32:31,998
Why? Are you scared that
teacher will hit you?

543
00:32:32,198 --> 00:32:34,358
No. I am not scared
of the beatings.

544
00:32:34,918 --> 00:32:36,558
But if you tell it to the teacher..

545
00:32:36,958 --> 00:32:38,838
He will not take me to
your house any longer.

546
00:32:38,878 --> 00:32:40,278
And if I don't come to your house..

547
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:42,518
I will have to fill my stomach
drinking tap water.

548
00:32:44,558 --> 00:32:45,878
Prashant forgave me.

549
00:32:47,558 --> 00:32:50,038
I used to go to his house like
everyday in the evenings.

550
00:32:50,998 --> 00:32:52,278
And I got the snacks.

551
00:32:55,278 --> 00:32:58,198
Then one day, Prashant's
father was transferred.

552
00:33:00,358 --> 00:33:02,038
And my father was transferred
too.

553
00:33:03,238 --> 00:33:04,238
Up there.

554
00:33:06,598 --> 00:33:08,238
Really, problems don't come alone.

555
00:33:10,478 --> 00:33:11,638
My brother went crazy.

556
00:33:13,478 --> 00:33:14,958
There was darkness all around me.

557
00:33:17,958 --> 00:33:20,678
I just had two ways in my options.

558
00:33:23,638 --> 00:33:26,038
Either to beg and get what
I want, or snatch it.

559
00:33:27,438 --> 00:33:29,518
I thought that the person
who doesn't have anything..

560
00:33:29,598 --> 00:33:31,958
He has all the rights to snatch..

561
00:33:32,758 --> 00:33:34,958
Things from people
who have everything.

562
00:33:36,798 --> 00:33:37,918
I joined a gang.

563
00:33:39,318 --> 00:33:40,918
And I kept stealing..

564
00:33:40,998 --> 00:33:42,838
Wandering from one city to another.

565
00:33:47,398 --> 00:33:48,398
Here.

566
00:33:54,478 --> 00:33:56,398
Sorry, sir. I am blind.

567
00:33:57,078 --> 00:33:58,278
Please help me cross the road.

568
00:33:58,318 --> 00:34:00,158
- Where do you want to go?
- Telli Gully.

569
00:34:00,918 --> 00:34:01,918
Come.

570
00:34:07,958 --> 00:34:09,078
Greetings, inspector.

571
00:34:09,158 --> 00:34:10,158
Greetings.

572
00:34:10,678 --> 00:34:11,558
Careful.

573
00:34:11,638 --> 00:34:13,278
There is a ditch ahead.
You will slip.

574
00:34:13,358 --> 00:34:15,318
That's okay. I will go myself now.

575
00:34:18,678 --> 00:34:20,238
May God bless you, sir.

576
00:34:20,838 --> 00:34:22,398
May he keep your family happy.

577
00:34:28,797 --> 00:34:30,717
Do you learn the
tricks from cinema?

578
00:34:30,958 --> 00:34:32,398
All of you will be caught today.

579
00:34:41,638 --> 00:34:42,278
Here.

580
00:34:42,358 --> 00:34:43,798
- How much is it?
- I don't know.

581
00:34:48,318 --> 00:34:49,318
Here.

582
00:34:49,478 --> 00:34:51,038
What is this? Just ten rupees?

583
00:34:51,598 --> 00:34:52,598
How much do you want?

584
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:55,197
It is so much money. At
least give me fifty.

585
00:34:55,398 --> 00:34:57,118
Take whatever I give and
get lost from here.

586
00:34:57,198 --> 00:34:59,078
Or else, I will give
you fifty slaps.

587
00:34:59,438 --> 00:35:01,254
Fifty rupees. Did you father
ever see fifty rupees?

588
00:35:01,278 --> 00:35:02,318
Son of a beggar.

589
00:35:02,398 --> 00:35:03,678
My father wasn't a beggar.

590
00:35:04,358 --> 00:35:05,798
Then what? Was he a minister?

591
00:35:06,158 --> 00:35:07,454
If you weren't
the son of a beggar..

592
00:35:07,478 --> 00:35:09,254
You wouldn't go around stealing
wallets like this.

593
00:35:09,278 --> 00:35:11,878
If you say it again, it
won't be good, Kalia.

594
00:35:12,438 --> 00:35:14,318
You are a beggar, your
father is a beggar.

595
00:35:14,398 --> 00:35:15,878
And even your grandfather
is a beggar.

596
00:35:40,358 --> 00:35:43,358
Shirke.. arrest them both.

597
00:35:44,558 --> 00:35:45,558
Take them..

598
00:35:45,958 --> 00:35:46,958
Take them away.

599
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:51,398
The police caught and took
me away from there.

600
00:35:51,478 --> 00:35:53,398
To the hospital first.
And then to the court.

601
00:35:54,518 --> 00:35:56,238
I was startled when
I went to the court.

602
00:35:56,798 --> 00:35:58,278
Because the magistrate was..

603
00:36:00,038 --> 00:36:01,718
Then he had me released.

604
00:36:03,918 --> 00:36:05,278
Here, please sign here.

605
00:36:09,398 --> 00:36:10,398
Thank you, sir.

606
00:36:11,918 --> 00:36:13,158
Come on, son. Come home.

607
00:36:13,678 --> 00:36:14,958
You will stay with us now.

608
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,638
What work will I have to do?

609
00:36:18,118 --> 00:36:19,118
Work?

610
00:36:20,838 --> 00:36:22,078
You will have to work.

611
00:36:22,518 --> 00:36:24,078
You will have to do three tasks.

612
00:36:24,638 --> 00:36:26,398
Playing while it is
the time to play.

613
00:36:26,638 --> 00:36:28,238
Eating while it is the time to eat.

614
00:36:28,398 --> 00:36:30,878
And to study while it
is the time to study.

615
00:36:33,438 --> 00:36:35,438
He admitted me to school
along with Prashant.

616
00:36:37,438 --> 00:36:40,758
And then, after college,
to medical college.

617
00:36:42,398 --> 00:36:43,518
Prashant and me.

618
00:36:44,598 --> 00:36:46,038
Ram and Lakshman incarnate.

619
00:36:48,078 --> 00:36:49,958
But my past is there, isn't it?

620
00:36:52,358 --> 00:36:55,038
A criminal background,
a mad brother.

621
00:36:55,478 --> 00:36:57,174
I don't have a respectable
back ground, madam.

622
00:36:57,198 --> 00:36:58,278
I have committed many sins.

623
00:36:58,518 --> 00:37:01,238
I can't get married.
So I want that you marry with him.

624
00:37:04,518 --> 00:37:06,198
Whether I marry him or not..

625
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:08,798
How are you related with that?

626
00:37:10,598 --> 00:37:13,238
A astrologer told me that..

627
00:37:13,318 --> 00:37:15,998
All my sins will be cleared off
if I have my friend marriage.

628
00:37:17,038 --> 00:37:18,838
If you don't agree to
it even after this..

629
00:37:18,918 --> 00:37:20,558
I will have you kidnapped.

630
00:37:23,078 --> 00:37:25,878
And if I say yes?

631
00:37:30,398 --> 00:37:32,158
Then I will happier than Prashant.

632
00:37:57,882 --> 00:37:59,002
Here, have some tea.

633
00:38:05,042 --> 00:38:07,162
Why are you staring at
me like this? Please take it.

634
00:38:10,722 --> 00:38:11,722
Have a seat.

635
00:38:12,962 --> 00:38:15,002
I want to talk to you, have a seat.

636
00:38:17,882 --> 00:38:19,562
I have changed my decision.

637
00:38:20,242 --> 00:38:21,242
What?

638
00:38:21,962 --> 00:38:23,082
Sudhir is not going.

639
00:38:23,562 --> 00:38:26,202
I am thinking, I will cancel
my going to America too.

640
00:38:27,922 --> 00:38:30,762
Sudhir has told us why he
isn't going to America.

641
00:38:31,442 --> 00:38:33,762
But what is the reason for you
to not go to America?

642
00:38:35,282 --> 00:38:36,802
The reason for me not to
go to America?

643
00:38:37,762 --> 00:38:38,522
It's you.

644
00:38:38,602 --> 00:38:41,442
See. You are not a twenty
year old young man.

645
00:38:42,042 --> 00:38:43,042
You are a doctor.

646
00:38:43,162 --> 00:38:45,522
And father wants you to become
even a bigger doctor.

647
00:38:45,962 --> 00:38:48,482
Therefore, don't even
think about all this.

648
00:38:49,402 --> 00:38:50,562
Then, should I do something..

649
00:38:50,602 --> 00:38:52,282
Should I tell Sudhir
to try something..

650
00:38:52,522 --> 00:38:54,082
And tell dad to send you with me.

651
00:38:54,162 --> 00:38:55,162
No.

652
00:38:55,362 --> 00:38:56,522
And will dad live alone here?

653
00:38:56,602 --> 00:38:58,442
Why alone? Sudhir will
be with him, isn't it?

654
00:38:59,402 --> 00:39:00,642
But listen to me at least.

655
00:39:01,202 --> 00:39:03,042
You have to go to the
passport office.

656
00:39:03,282 --> 00:39:04,562
Get ready, quickly.

657
00:39:22,482 --> 00:39:23,962
Bless you, daughter. Bless you.

658
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:26,562
Stop this asking for
blessing every day.

659
00:39:27,362 --> 00:39:29,738
- And think about yourself as the daughter of this house.
- Yes.

660
00:39:29,762 --> 00:39:31,682
And think that Prashant
is the househusband here.

661
00:39:32,082 --> 00:39:35,722
She has buttered you
by all this, uncle.

662
00:39:36,482 --> 00:39:38,298
She has won over your heart
in a day, isn't it?

663
00:39:38,322 --> 00:39:40,602
But butter is applied only
on toast here, madam.

664
00:39:41,202 --> 00:39:42,762
Why are you calling her madam?

665
00:39:43,602 --> 00:39:45,802
Shall I shorten and call you mad?

666
00:39:46,122 --> 00:39:47,202
See this, father.

667
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:48,802
Why?

668
00:39:49,122 --> 00:39:50,682
Can't you call me sister-in-law?

669
00:39:51,122 --> 00:39:53,229
In which Mahabharata is it written
that Lakshman's wife be called..

670
00:39:53,253 --> 00:39:54,922
Sister-in-law by Lord Rama?

671
00:39:55,082 --> 00:39:56,402
Not Mahabharata, Ramayana.

672
00:39:56,482 --> 00:39:57,562
Yes, that's it.

673
00:39:58,562 --> 00:39:59,562
You are correct.

674
00:40:00,322 --> 00:40:01,922
According to the
birth certificate..

675
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:04,242
You are twenty days
older than Prashant.

676
00:40:04,442 --> 00:40:05,578
Why don't you call
the younger bride?

677
00:40:05,602 --> 00:40:06,402
No, father.

678
00:40:06,482 --> 00:40:09,002
See, it is objection
your owner already.

679
00:40:09,682 --> 00:40:12,682
What if I call you Sakhi?

680
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:14,562
Wow..

681
00:40:15,162 --> 00:40:17,162
Lord Krishna used to
call Arjuna as Sakha.

682
00:40:17,602 --> 00:40:19,162
And he used to call Draupadi Sakhi.

683
00:40:19,642 --> 00:40:20,722
Use to protect her.

684
00:40:21,402 --> 00:40:24,202
I knew it, Ramlal.. there
is a poet in you too.

685
00:40:24,842 --> 00:40:26,082
This is what I felt too.

686
00:40:26,522 --> 00:40:28,402
He is a very bad man.

687
00:40:30,002 --> 00:40:31,042
Good morning, dad.

688
00:40:31,122 --> 00:40:32,522
Morning, my son.

689
00:40:32,919 --> 00:40:34,482
Why were you people laughing?

690
00:40:34,562 --> 00:40:38,082
Prashant, I gave your wife
a strange present today.

691
00:40:38,522 --> 00:40:39,362
What?

692
00:40:39,442 --> 00:40:40,522
A new name.

693
00:40:41,082 --> 00:40:42,082
Sakhi.

694
00:40:42,642 --> 00:40:43,642
Wow!

695
00:40:43,762 --> 00:40:45,882
This is called a cheap present.

696
00:40:47,402 --> 00:40:49,282
One needs a heart to spend.

697
00:40:49,962 --> 00:40:50,962
You are right.

698
00:40:51,922 --> 00:40:54,042
I have kept my heart
in the safe deposit.

699
00:40:55,842 --> 00:40:57,482
There are a lot of
robberies nowadays.

700
00:40:58,202 --> 00:40:59,642
God knows when one can rob mine.

701
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:01,082
Here.

702
00:41:02,642 --> 00:41:07,002
A present from my side too.

703
00:41:09,242 --> 00:41:11,082
Open and see what is there
in the envelope.

704
00:41:11,162 --> 00:41:11,962
How are you connected?

705
00:41:12,042 --> 00:41:14,882
Hey, I am connected to everything
related to you now, Sakhi.

706
00:41:16,202 --> 00:41:17,202
What is this?

707
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:19,202
You had met in Kashmir, isn't it?

708
00:41:19,282 --> 00:41:20,282
Yes.

709
00:41:20,642 --> 00:41:22,442
Then go to Kashmir and
spend your honey moon.

710
00:41:22,522 --> 00:41:24,842
But why three tickets? Why should
I go in their honeymoon?

711
00:41:24,922 --> 00:41:27,722
Have Ram and Lakshman
ever separated?

712
00:41:28,282 --> 00:41:29,762
They went together
for the exile too.

713
00:41:29,922 --> 00:41:33,442
Hey, Sakhi.
Don't give us this ideas.

714
00:41:33,722 --> 00:41:35,178
That was an exile.
This is a honey moon.

715
00:41:35,202 --> 00:41:38,042
- Okay, then don't call me as Sakhi.
- Why?

716
00:41:57,402 --> 00:42:03,922
"This is such a beautiful picture."

717
00:42:04,402 --> 00:42:09,562
"The weather is so aromatic.."

718
00:42:10,442 --> 00:42:13,962
"This is a Kashmir.."

719
00:42:14,042 --> 00:42:17,602
"This is a Kashmir.."

720
00:42:18,402 --> 00:42:23,602
"This is such a beautiful picture."

721
00:42:24,882 --> 00:42:30,562
"The weather is so aromatic.."

722
00:42:31,402 --> 00:42:34,362
"This is a Kashmir.."

723
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:37,602
"This is a Kashmir.."

724
00:42:54,362 --> 00:43:01,042
"There are heavens beneath
the mountains."

725
00:43:01,242 --> 00:43:04,802
"We are here today."

726
00:43:08,282 --> 00:43:14,802
"There are heavens beneath
the mountains."

727
00:43:15,082 --> 00:43:19,082
"We are here today."

728
00:43:19,202 --> 00:43:24,082
"Friend.. this is our fate.."

729
00:43:26,242 --> 00:43:31,162
"This is such a beautiful picture."

730
00:43:32,282 --> 00:43:35,362
"This is a Kashmir.."

731
00:43:35,802 --> 00:43:38,562
"This is a Kashmir.."

732
00:44:03,802 --> 00:44:10,442
"From this sky, from this earth,
this garden of flowers.."

733
00:44:10,802 --> 00:44:14,122
"It is difficult to
go away from here!"

734
00:44:17,642 --> 00:44:24,242
"From this sky, from this earth,
this garden of flowers.."

735
00:44:24,602 --> 00:44:28,482
"It is difficult to
go away from here!"

736
00:44:28,642 --> 00:44:34,002
"Oh, is this a breeze or a chain?"

737
00:44:35,682 --> 00:44:40,602
"This is such a beautiful picture."

738
00:44:41,722 --> 00:44:44,802
"This is a Kashmir.."

739
00:44:45,282 --> 00:44:48,282
"This is a Kashmir.."

740
00:44:48,762 --> 00:44:52,202
"This is a Kashmir.."

741
00:44:55,322 --> 00:44:57,162
The Shankacharya
temple is up there.

742
00:44:57,962 --> 00:44:59,842
- What is there to eat?
- Whatever you say, sir.

743
00:44:59,962 --> 00:45:01,202
Sandwich..
Pokora.. samosa..

744
00:45:01,362 --> 00:45:02,162
Pakora.

745
00:45:02,242 --> 00:45:03,458
Okay, bring three plates samosas.

746
00:45:03,482 --> 00:45:05,282
- And three cups of tea. Quickly.
- Yes.

747
00:45:06,362 --> 00:45:09,186
Leave the tea man, ask for beer.

748
00:45:09,266 --> 00:45:11,442
Forget about beer,
get some whiskey.

749
00:45:11,642 --> 00:45:12,682
Whiskey? At this time?

750
00:45:12,762 --> 00:45:14,122
Yes, one should be intoxicated.

751
00:45:14,202 --> 00:45:15,762
At all times after
coming in Kashmir.

752
00:45:16,002 --> 00:45:17,002
Waiter..

753
00:45:18,082 --> 00:45:20,642
Hey, the whiskey's mother is
coming to us all by itself.

754
00:45:20,802 --> 00:45:21,802
Wow!

755
00:45:24,962 --> 00:45:26,882
Hey, Prashant. Do you
remember that mountain?

756
00:45:27,202 --> 00:45:28,762
We had met there
for the first time.

757
00:45:28,842 --> 00:45:30,962
Yes, I was stuck there
the first time.

758
00:45:31,722 --> 00:45:33,402
Have you noticed something,
friends?

759
00:45:33,682 --> 00:45:37,482
The girls nowadays have
fun with two people.

760
00:45:37,642 --> 00:45:38,962
Then, why are you jealous?

761
00:45:39,042 --> 00:45:40,522
Why shouldn't I be jealous?

762
00:45:40,762 --> 00:45:42,402
There are three here and two there.

763
00:45:42,802 --> 00:45:46,442
And there is someone there and
there isn't anyone here!

764
00:45:48,802 --> 00:45:51,562
They are the rotten kids
of newly rich people.

765
00:45:51,882 --> 00:45:54,402
Let the mad dogs bark.
Why do you hear them?

766
00:45:55,082 --> 00:45:57,402
I will not hear them,
I will just hit them.

767
00:45:58,442 --> 00:45:59,442
Forget it.

768
00:46:02,242 --> 00:46:03,802
- Morning.
- Morning.

769
00:46:04,002 --> 00:46:05,202
Please, one minute.

770
00:46:06,682 --> 00:46:07,682
Thank you.

771
00:46:08,842 --> 00:46:10,202
Where have you come from?

772
00:46:10,682 --> 00:46:11,682
Delhi.

773
00:46:11,762 --> 00:46:12,602
Why?

774
00:46:12,682 --> 00:46:15,002
Because you seem
from good families.

775
00:46:15,202 --> 00:46:16,202
Yes.

776
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:20,482
But I am sad to say,
your parents have expired.

777
00:46:20,562 --> 00:46:22,682
What are you saying?
Our parents are alive and well.

778
00:46:23,002 --> 00:46:24,002
No.

779
00:46:24,162 --> 00:46:26,802
If they were all right,
you wouldn't be so insolent.

780
00:46:27,522 --> 00:46:29,002
You are certainly orphans.

781
00:46:31,922 --> 00:46:34,322
- Don't touch that.
- I will eat one.

782
00:46:36,442 --> 00:46:38,362
Keep it there else
I won't spare you.

783
00:46:39,402 --> 00:46:40,762
I will eat this, okay.

784
00:46:45,762 --> 00:46:46,922
Brother.. hold this.

785
00:46:48,522 --> 00:46:49,522
Please don't go.

786
00:46:53,762 --> 00:46:54,762
Sudhir..

787
00:46:54,882 --> 00:46:56,482
- Insolent..
- Move, Prashant!

788
00:46:58,282 --> 00:47:00,082
You raised your hands on us?

789
00:47:00,162 --> 00:47:02,362
Yes.
Shall I kick you now?

790
00:47:03,122 --> 00:47:05,362
This richness won't
work in our presence.

791
00:47:05,602 --> 00:47:07,562
Get lost from here. Come on!

792
00:47:22,922 --> 00:47:25,362
Here you are. This saree is for me.

793
00:47:25,882 --> 00:47:28,402
Am I going to America? For me?

794
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:31,562
Why are you angry on me? Sudhir
brought it for you.

795
00:47:32,442 --> 00:47:33,442
Why did you bring saree.

796
00:47:34,522 --> 00:47:35,522
This is strange.

797
00:47:35,842 --> 00:47:36,938
This is the first
Indian woman whom..

798
00:47:36,962 --> 00:47:38,258
I see not happy while
getting a saree.

799
00:47:38,282 --> 00:47:41,562
Sakhi.. when Prashant
goes to America..

800
00:47:42,162 --> 00:47:43,802
You will be at peace
for somedays..

801
00:47:43,882 --> 00:47:46,402
- With this saree, isn't it?
- Don't talk rubbish.

802
00:47:46,722 --> 00:47:48,602
Why are you not going to America?

803
00:47:49,162 --> 00:47:53,122
Prashant.. women's mind is
just like a gramophone peg.

804
00:47:53,362 --> 00:47:54,778
If it is stuck somewhere,
it is stuck there.

805
00:47:54,802 --> 00:47:56,482
Then, there is
no respite from that.

806
00:47:57,482 --> 00:47:59,442
Do you what to know why
I am not going to America?

807
00:48:01,362 --> 00:48:02,402
Yes. I know that.

808
00:48:02,722 --> 00:48:05,522
Come here. Sit down.

809
00:48:06,682 --> 00:48:07,682
See..

810
00:48:08,002 --> 00:48:09,442
You have been newly married.

811
00:48:09,602 --> 00:48:11,482
- And he is leaving you.
- Yes.

812
00:48:12,362 --> 00:48:15,442
This is confirmed that he
will yearn for you there.

813
00:48:16,002 --> 00:48:17,442
So, it is possible
that he embraces..

814
00:48:17,922 --> 00:48:22,202
Some maiden there
to quench his thirst.

815
00:48:22,562 --> 00:48:26,362
What? Why? Is this what you wish?

816
00:48:26,962 --> 00:48:30,162
This is not my wish, but what
can be said about the future?

817
00:48:30,482 --> 00:48:31,362
What do you say, Sudhir?

818
00:48:31,442 --> 00:48:34,442
What about the future?
I want this to happen.

819
00:48:35,002 --> 00:48:36,002
Is it?

820
00:48:37,002 --> 00:48:39,282
If this happens,
you will be very happy, isn't it?

821
00:48:40,202 --> 00:48:41,202
Why not?

822
00:48:41,802 --> 00:48:43,562
If he embraces some maiden there..

823
00:48:43,842 --> 00:48:46,722
I will get you in second
hand to embrace you.

824
00:48:46,962 --> 00:48:49,762
Insolent.. you say anything
that you want!

825
00:48:50,962 --> 00:48:52,322
God forbid! His joke!

826
00:48:55,362 --> 00:48:58,002
Are you not ashamed?
To laugh at such jokes?

827
00:48:58,602 --> 00:48:59,602
See, Kavita..

828
00:49:00,202 --> 00:49:02,362
There are only two people
who can joke like this.

829
00:49:03,162 --> 00:49:05,242
One, the people who have
some sin in their hearts.

830
00:49:06,082 --> 00:49:08,402
And the others, the people who
have no sin in their hearts.

831
00:49:09,242 --> 00:49:11,762
Do I have to tell you what
kind of a person Sudhir is?

832
00:49:12,762 --> 00:49:15,882
I am leaving you in
his care to America.

833
00:49:16,242 --> 00:49:17,882
And I won't be having
any worries there.

834
00:49:18,402 --> 00:49:22,642
So you won't have
any worries there?

835
00:49:23,202 --> 00:49:24,202
Worry?

836
00:49:26,282 --> 00:49:27,722
You won't wait for anyone?

837
00:49:30,402 --> 00:49:31,562
Not even the post man?

838
00:49:31,882 --> 00:49:32,882
Post man.

839
00:49:32,962 --> 00:49:35,122
Oh yes! I remember!
Okay, come on, promise me.

840
00:49:35,362 --> 00:49:37,122
You will write a letter
to me every week.

841
00:49:37,282 --> 00:49:40,202
No, once in every two weeks.

842
00:49:40,762 --> 00:49:43,002
Then, one in every three days.

843
00:49:43,162 --> 00:49:45,082
Okay.. once in one week.

844
00:49:45,362 --> 00:49:48,522
No, one every day.
Promise me.. promise me..

845
00:49:48,602 --> 00:49:49,722
I promise.

846
00:50:22,503 --> 00:50:24,475
Father. The medicine.

847
00:50:25,435 --> 00:50:28,115
The album is a great thing.

848
00:50:29,355 --> 00:50:33,795
People, places everything
is right how is it is.

849
00:50:35,355 --> 00:50:37,235
Now, it is ten months
that Prashant has left.

850
00:50:37,395 --> 00:50:41,115
See, from his childhood to today..
He is right here.

851
00:50:43,555 --> 00:50:46,515
I saw forty years of my life.

852
00:50:48,555 --> 00:50:52,595
Why are you so sad, father?
It is a matter of days now!

853
00:50:53,035 --> 00:50:55,195
I am the only one who is sad.

854
00:50:55,755 --> 00:50:57,715
The rest of the house is
very happy, isn't it?

855
00:50:58,795 --> 00:51:02,235
There is such a silence in the
house because he has gone.

856
00:51:03,315 --> 00:51:04,955
I can sometimes hear your voice.

857
00:51:06,035 --> 00:51:07,755
But Sudhir is so silent!

858
00:51:22,241 --> 00:51:23,241
Doctor..

859
00:51:24,235 --> 00:51:25,235
Oh, you..

860
00:51:25,995 --> 00:51:27,755
I told you not
to rise from the bed?

861
00:51:27,875 --> 00:51:29,315
My fever has run away.

862
00:51:29,395 --> 00:51:31,195
Didn't you say that drinking
sour medicine..

863
00:51:31,275 --> 00:51:33,835
- Will make the fever run away?
- See, wasn't I correct?

864
00:51:34,115 --> 00:51:35,995
But why didn't Meena's
fever run away?

865
00:51:36,195 --> 00:51:37,795
Even she takes sour medicine.

866
00:51:38,075 --> 00:51:39,451
Who says that it
hasn't disappeared?

867
00:51:39,475 --> 00:51:40,635
Come on, we will have a look.

868
00:51:42,155 --> 00:51:43,155
Meena..

869
00:51:44,075 --> 00:51:45,315
Greetings, uncle.

870
00:51:45,835 --> 00:51:46,835
Greetings.

871
00:51:47,755 --> 00:51:50,315
Let us see whether your fever
has come down or not.

872
00:51:52,835 --> 00:51:54,795
Your fever has decreased.

873
00:51:55,355 --> 00:51:57,315
Meena's fever is running,
isn't it, uncle?

874
00:51:57,395 --> 00:51:58,155
Totally.

875
00:51:58,235 --> 00:51:59,915
The elephant has gone
and the tail is left.

876
00:52:00,315 --> 00:52:01,315
Coward!

877
00:52:01,435 --> 00:52:02,651
The elephant left his
tail and ran away.

878
00:52:02,675 --> 00:52:04,555
Did you see the magic
of my medicine?

879
00:52:05,435 --> 00:52:07,835
Uncle, do you get fever
sometimes too?

880
00:52:08,555 --> 00:52:10,155
Yes, I do get fever too.

881
00:52:10,395 --> 00:52:12,075
Then, who gives you the medicine?

882
00:52:12,915 --> 00:52:14,691
Child, I don't have anyone
to give me medicine.

883
00:52:14,715 --> 00:52:16,795
Okay, I will give you the medicine.

884
00:52:17,795 --> 00:52:19,195
Will you have yourself cured by us?

885
00:52:19,235 --> 00:52:20,275
Yes. Of course, why not.

886
00:52:20,395 --> 00:52:22,355
- Then give this to me.
- Yes, of course, take it.

887
00:52:27,475 --> 00:52:30,795
Take a deep breath. A deep breath.

888
00:52:34,355 --> 00:52:35,995
Show me your eyes, son.

889
00:52:37,595 --> 00:52:40,475
Show me your tongue, your tongue.

890
00:52:41,235 --> 00:52:42,155
Not like this.

891
00:52:42,235 --> 00:52:43,515
Open you mouth properly.

892
00:52:45,035 --> 00:52:48,275
Our son has got all the teeth!

893
00:52:51,955 --> 00:52:54,395
Sir, Mrs. Chaturvedi
has called. Urgent.

894
00:52:55,035 --> 00:52:56,595
Okay. You stay here.

895
00:52:58,075 --> 00:52:59,195
Give it to me, son.

896
00:53:04,315 --> 00:53:05,315
Hello.

897
00:53:07,635 --> 00:53:08,635
Yes..

898
00:53:09,715 --> 00:53:10,715
I will come..

899
00:53:10,755 --> 00:53:12,115
I will come right away.

900
00:53:12,435 --> 00:53:13,515
What happened, sir?

901
00:53:13,595 --> 00:53:15,395
Uncle. It seems he
has a heart attack.

902
00:53:15,475 --> 00:53:16,675
This is the fourth one.

903
00:53:20,675 --> 00:53:22,595
Is it hurting a lot, father?

904
00:53:25,875 --> 00:53:28,555
The doctors must be
arriving right away.

905
00:53:29,755 --> 00:53:30,995
No, daughter-in-law.

906
00:53:31,915 --> 00:53:33,235
It seems that even the doctors..

907
00:53:33,315 --> 00:53:35,275
Will not be able to
do anything this time

908
00:53:36,075 --> 00:53:39,355
Father, please don't say anything..

909
00:53:39,675 --> 00:53:43,275
Let me speak, daughter-in-law..

910
00:53:44,435 --> 00:53:46,915
See, don't feel bad.

911
00:53:47,875 --> 00:53:51,395
Prashant is your husband,
But I am his father.

912
00:53:52,675 --> 00:53:54,355
You know him since a year.

913
00:53:55,435 --> 00:53:56,755
I know him since childhood.

914
00:53:57,915 --> 00:54:02,235
He is very weak.
He can break under pressure.

915
00:54:03,715 --> 00:54:05,875
Therefore, if there is
such a moment in life..

916
00:54:06,635 --> 00:54:08,515
Have faith in Sudhir.

917
00:54:13,275 --> 00:54:14,275
Uncle..

918
00:54:14,715 --> 00:54:18,355
Sudhir, you have come?
I want to talk to you.

919
00:54:18,555 --> 00:54:19,795
You lay there silently.

920
00:54:20,275 --> 00:54:22,235
Listen to me first.

921
00:54:23,075 --> 00:54:25,235
Promise me that you will not
tell anything to Prashant.

922
00:54:26,195 --> 00:54:28,515
It is only six months for
his studies to get over.

923
00:54:29,195 --> 00:54:31,555
Uncle, do you know how angry
I get with these matters?

924
00:54:31,995 --> 00:54:32,715
First, you get all right.

925
00:54:32,795 --> 00:54:34,275
And then tell me whatever
you want to.

926
00:54:34,475 --> 00:54:35,795
I will call Dr. Kapoor.

927
00:54:40,835 --> 00:54:41,755
The phone is dead.

928
00:54:41,835 --> 00:54:43,131
It was working
fine a moment before.

929
00:54:43,155 --> 00:54:44,275
I will call Dr. Kapoor.

930
00:54:44,515 --> 00:54:48,475
Sudhir.. listen to me.. listen..

931
00:54:50,995 --> 00:54:52,275
He has gone.

932
00:54:53,355 --> 00:54:54,435
Daughter-in-law..

933
00:54:55,555 --> 00:54:57,755
He seems to be a happy
go lucky man..

934
00:54:59,955 --> 00:55:02,475
But he is very sad actually.

935
00:55:04,395 --> 00:55:05,995
Look after him nicely.

936
00:55:08,518 --> 00:55:09,755
When I brought him home..

937
00:55:11,515 --> 00:55:12,835
People told me..

938
00:55:13,755 --> 00:55:18,275
Bring a dog from the dirt and
gutter.

939
00:55:19,435 --> 00:55:21,075
The dog will remain loyal.

940
00:55:21,635 --> 00:55:24,155
But don't bring a man
out from the dirt.

941
00:55:25,115 --> 00:55:28,515
The man will kick you one day.

942
00:55:29,315 --> 00:55:31,675
Because you know the
secret of his birth.

943
00:55:33,435 --> 00:55:34,435
But..

944
00:55:35,315 --> 00:55:36,915
But I didn't agree to them.

945
00:55:37,515 --> 00:55:40,635
And wow.. wow.

946
00:55:42,235 --> 00:55:44,635
He came true to my belief.

947
00:55:47,355 --> 00:55:48,715
Daughter-in-law..

948
00:55:49,715 --> 00:55:51,515
There is your mother's photo there.

949
00:55:51,635 --> 00:55:53,195
Yes
- Please bring it.

950
00:56:06,435 --> 00:56:09,715
Father.. father.. father!

951
00:56:36,275 --> 00:56:37,275
Doctor..

952
00:56:55,555 --> 00:56:56,715
Sorry, Sudhir.

953
00:56:57,555 --> 00:56:59,755
We were late by
half an hour. Sorry.

954
00:57:30,355 --> 00:57:31,355
Sudhir..

955
00:57:36,235 --> 00:57:37,235
Sudhir.

956
00:57:38,435 --> 00:57:39,435
Sudhir.

957
00:57:40,675 --> 00:57:41,875
What happened to you?

958
00:57:43,595 --> 00:57:44,755
What happened to you?

959
00:57:46,035 --> 00:57:47,395
Why don't you speak?

960
00:57:48,275 --> 00:57:50,075
Why don't you speak?

961
00:57:55,247 --> 00:57:57,047
Where did you go so
early in the morning?

962
00:57:57,567 --> 00:57:58,927
I went to Dr. Ibrahim's house.

963
00:57:59,567 --> 00:58:00,887
He is migrating to Israel.

964
00:58:01,887 --> 00:58:04,047
I am thinking of buying
nursing home.

965
00:58:05,327 --> 00:58:06,327
Nursing home?

966
00:58:07,367 --> 00:58:08,367
Yes, Sudhir.

967
00:58:09,567 --> 00:58:10,807
I don't want to live like this.

968
00:58:12,407 --> 00:58:13,407
Like this?

969
00:58:16,487 --> 00:58:19,265
Now, I have understood something.

970
00:58:20,567 --> 00:58:22,992
Moving ahead in our profession
is not a straight journey.

971
00:58:23,072 --> 00:58:25,607
It is a crooked journey,
a totally crooked journey.

972
00:58:27,607 --> 00:58:28,607
Keep talking..

973
00:58:28,927 --> 00:58:29,927
I will speak.

974
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:32,167
I got such a huge degree
from America.

975
00:58:32,407 --> 00:58:34,687
Did I get a job?
Did I start my practice?

976
00:58:35,927 --> 00:58:37,927
- Why are you in such haste?
- I am in haste..

977
00:58:38,807 --> 00:58:40,287
Because.. in our country.

978
00:58:40,407 --> 00:58:42,047
A person takes his whole
life to make..

979
00:58:42,127 --> 00:58:43,988
Eleven rupees of ten
rupees in our country.

980
00:58:44,068 --> 00:58:47,367
But is a snap to make eleven
lakhs out of ten lakhs.

981
00:58:51,207 --> 00:58:53,043
And this is what
I wish to play with.

982
00:58:55,807 --> 00:58:57,767
If we have a huge nursing home.

983
00:58:59,207 --> 00:59:01,802
And we can give a commission
to all the big doctors..

984
00:59:03,527 --> 00:59:05,207
You will find
out what progress is.

985
00:59:10,647 --> 00:59:12,422
- Shall I make it for you?
- No.

986
00:59:18,167 --> 00:59:19,527
Prashant, tell me something.

987
00:59:20,527 --> 00:59:23,127
Is this the only way to progress?

988
00:59:24,247 --> 00:59:26,120
Yes, if you want to progress..

989
00:59:27,487 --> 00:59:29,967
The way which comes first..
Is correct.

990
00:59:32,487 --> 00:59:34,047
Why did father send me to America?

991
00:59:35,087 --> 00:59:36,407
To become a big doctor.

992
00:59:37,607 --> 00:59:38,927
I didn't see him as he died.

993
00:59:40,527 --> 00:59:42,607
But I will fulfill his desire.

994
00:59:43,367 --> 00:59:44,727
By hook or by crook.

995
00:59:47,567 --> 00:59:48,607
Just a minute.

996
00:59:50,247 --> 00:59:51,767
Not here. There.

997
00:59:53,927 --> 00:59:55,527
You will die in these sentiments
one day.

998
00:59:55,887 --> 00:59:57,210
We have to die one day.

999
00:59:57,727 --> 01:00:00,258
Why don't we die in sentiments
instead of illness?

1000
01:00:00,807 --> 01:00:02,047
Anyway.. Forget all this.

1001
01:00:02,906 --> 01:00:04,223
Tell me. From where will you get..

1002
01:00:04,247 --> 01:00:06,167
The money to buy Dr.
Ibrahim's nursing home?

1003
01:00:06,847 --> 01:00:08,087
I will sell this house.

1004
01:00:11,694 --> 01:00:13,374
You will sell the ancestor's house?

1005
01:00:13,894 --> 01:00:16,150
When father isn't there, what will
I do of the ancestor's house?

1006
01:00:16,174 --> 01:00:17,174
What do you say, Sudhir?

1007
01:00:19,014 --> 01:00:20,254
It is your wish, brother.

1008
01:00:20,734 --> 01:00:22,254
What will I do with just my wish?

1009
01:00:23,294 --> 01:00:25,694
He has made you a share
holder of his will too.

1010
01:00:27,174 --> 01:00:28,854
Oh yes, I had almost forgotten.

1011
01:00:29,894 --> 01:00:30,894
What to do?

1012
01:00:31,254 --> 01:00:32,374
It's just a signature.

1013
01:00:33,294 --> 01:00:34,294
Here.

1014
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:40,463
Here.

1015
01:00:57,694 --> 01:00:59,174
Give this letter to your employer..

1016
01:00:59,254 --> 01:01:01,574
And tell him that the furniture
should come in two days.

1017
01:01:02,014 --> 01:01:03,014
Sakhi..

1018
01:01:04,695 --> 01:01:05,695
Oh.. Sakhi..

1019
01:01:07,294 --> 01:01:09,854
Wow.. the furniture
has come, isn't it?

1020
01:01:10,054 --> 01:01:11,174
Careful.

1021
01:01:11,774 --> 01:01:12,494
Did you like it?

1022
01:01:12,574 --> 01:01:13,574
Yes, first class.

1023
01:01:13,894 --> 01:01:15,334
Come have a look of your room also.

1024
01:01:15,414 --> 01:01:16,534
Err.. just a minute.

1025
01:01:17,134 --> 01:01:19,094
Didn't I tell you,
that I have take..

1026
01:01:19,174 --> 01:01:21,134
My room just near the
children's hospital?

1027
01:01:22,134 --> 01:01:25,614
Can I ask you, why you cannot
stay here with us?

1028
01:01:25,694 --> 01:01:27,094
Please ask.
Ask.

1029
01:01:27,174 --> 01:01:28,934
Sudhir, don't anger me more, okay?

1030
01:01:29,014 --> 01:01:33,305
Prashant. Your wife is beautiful
but up there..

1031
01:01:34,321 --> 01:01:36,814
See, Sakhi.
How far is the hospital?

1032
01:01:37,294 --> 01:01:38,414
Sixteen kilometers.

1033
01:01:38,654 --> 01:01:40,014
If there is some emergence case..

1034
01:01:40,094 --> 01:01:41,854
Till the time I reach
there.. I will be..

1035
01:01:42,694 --> 01:01:44,334
And if I make haste,
this is Bombay.

1036
01:01:44,574 --> 01:01:46,574
All the places are dug up here,
it is all a trump.

1037
01:01:46,654 --> 01:01:48,254
If I have a accident,
the doctor is gone.

1038
01:01:51,694 --> 01:01:56,054
Prashant, tell your wife not
to look at me like this.

1039
01:01:57,294 --> 01:01:58,334
I get weak.

1040
01:01:59,214 --> 01:02:01,254
My heart beats
and I can't control myself.

1041
01:02:01,694 --> 01:02:03,214
See. Tell her..
I will kidnap her.

1042
01:02:03,734 --> 01:02:04,734
Handled it.

1043
01:02:04,894 --> 01:02:07,094
Your settled house will be ruined.
You will be ruined.

1044
01:02:07,334 --> 01:02:08,774
I am ruined.

1045
01:02:09,974 --> 01:02:11,974
Why don't you try to understand,
Sakhi?

1046
01:02:12,614 --> 01:02:14,614
Didn't I tell you that
I have a couple of affairs?

1047
01:02:14,974 --> 01:02:16,814
When Prashant was a bachelor,
it was all right.

1048
01:02:16,894 --> 01:02:18,534
But what will I do in
front of his wife?

1049
01:02:19,094 --> 01:02:22,254
I am immoral.. but
I have some dignity.

1050
01:02:23,854 --> 01:02:25,814
I will go now. I have
to go to the hospital.

1051
01:02:26,454 --> 01:02:28,134
Hey.. why are you in such a hurry?

1052
01:02:28,374 --> 01:02:30,734
The taxi is standing outside.
The meter is running.

1053
01:02:35,894 --> 01:02:37,854
He has started to make
my blood boil nowadays.

1054
01:02:38,574 --> 01:02:43,814
But then, sometimes I think that
he is hiding something too.

1055
01:03:02,654 --> 01:03:04,774
- 537207?
- Yes?

1056
01:03:04,854 --> 01:03:06,174
May I speak to Dr. Agarwal?

1057
01:03:06,454 --> 01:03:07,454
Yes, speaking.

1058
01:03:07,894 --> 01:03:09,814
- Good morning, Dr. Agarwal.
- Good morning.

1059
01:03:09,894 --> 01:03:11,614
I am Nandini Malhotra.

1060
01:03:11,854 --> 01:03:14,054
I am Dr. Prashant Chaturvedi's PA.

1061
01:03:14,614 --> 01:03:16,614
I had just called
you to remind you..

1062
01:03:16,774 --> 01:03:18,110
That Dr. Prashant's new nursing..

1063
01:03:18,134 --> 01:03:19,894
Home is being inaugurated
next week..

1064
01:03:20,014 --> 01:03:23,134
And also his house warming party.

1065
01:03:23,374 --> 01:03:25,614
He has said that is necessary
for you two to come.

1066
01:03:25,854 --> 01:03:27,134
Yes, surely, we will come.

1067
01:03:27,214 --> 01:03:28,574
Thank you, Doctor.

1068
01:03:33,054 --> 01:03:34,054
Tea.

1069
01:03:34,094 --> 01:03:35,254
Thank you, Susheela.

1070
01:03:35,854 --> 01:03:37,094
Did you do all the phones?

1071
01:03:37,174 --> 01:03:38,190
How can I do all the calls?

1072
01:03:38,214 --> 01:03:40,454
I had to move my fingers
times for sixteen calls.

1073
01:03:40,654 --> 01:03:42,016
My fingers were ruined.

1074
01:03:42,494 --> 01:03:43,934
Why? Were the phones engaged?

1075
01:03:44,014 --> 01:03:45,590
No. They weren't engaged.
Just wrong numbers.

1076
01:03:45,614 --> 01:03:46,667
Good morning, Susheela.

1077
01:03:46,747 --> 01:03:48,534
- Good morning, sir.
- Please have a seat.

1078
01:03:48,734 --> 01:03:50,214
Did you remind everybody?

1079
01:03:50,294 --> 01:03:51,777
There are just
a few calls left now.

1080
01:03:52,174 --> 01:03:53,014
- Susheela..
- Yes, sir?

1081
01:03:53,094 --> 01:03:54,390
Please tell Dr. Dubey
and Dr. Rehman..

1082
01:03:54,414 --> 01:03:56,230
I am coming to the operation
theatre right now.

1083
01:03:56,254 --> 01:03:57,710
I will the new machines
that have arrived.

1084
01:03:57,734 --> 01:03:58,374
Okay, sir.

1085
01:03:58,454 --> 01:03:59,654
And. Did you call him?

1086
01:03:59,734 --> 01:04:01,374
Yes, sir. I will make
this call right now.

1087
01:04:01,574 --> 01:04:02,574
Come, Sudhir.

1088
01:04:02,654 --> 01:04:04,534
Sudhir, this is my PA,
Miss Malhotra.

1089
01:04:04,614 --> 01:04:06,454
- And he is my partner..
- Dr. Rai?

1090
01:04:06,574 --> 01:04:09,014
Yes, but I am in his partner.
Only in profit.

1091
01:04:09,614 --> 01:04:12,854
This is his life partner,
Mrs. Kavita Chaturvedi.

1092
01:04:13,454 --> 01:04:16,254
This is. Miss Malhotra, my PA.

1093
01:04:18,854 --> 01:04:19,934
What did you say?

1094
01:04:20,374 --> 01:04:24,614
My dear.. My PA.

1095
01:04:24,974 --> 01:04:26,054
Miss Malhotra..

1096
01:04:26,134 --> 01:04:28,214
I have seen you somewhere.

1097
01:04:28,294 --> 01:04:30,894
Even I have seen you somewhere.

1098
01:04:31,054 --> 01:04:32,854
I don't know where
you have seen me.

1099
01:04:33,054 --> 01:04:34,814
But Mrs. Kavita and
me studied together..

1100
01:04:34,894 --> 01:04:36,334
In the Sophiya Women's college.

1101
01:04:36,574 --> 01:04:37,974
She was two years senior to me.

1102
01:04:39,494 --> 01:04:41,854
I know her from
the women's college.

1103
01:04:42,614 --> 01:04:43,854
How do you know her?

1104
01:04:44,174 --> 01:04:46,614
Did you study in the
women's college too?

1105
01:04:46,774 --> 01:04:48,614
Why will I study in
the women's college?

1106
01:04:49,254 --> 01:04:52,894
I was a wastrel. I just roamed
around the colleges.

1107
01:04:52,974 --> 01:04:54,414
May be I must have seen there.

1108
01:04:55,054 --> 01:04:56,054
You too..

1109
01:04:56,094 --> 01:04:57,734
Please don't feel bad
about what he says.

1110
01:04:57,814 --> 01:04:59,054
He says whatever he feels like.

1111
01:04:59,134 --> 01:05:00,670
Come on, we will go
to the nursing home.

1112
01:05:00,694 --> 01:05:02,590
Hey, take some interest.
Come in the nursing home.

1113
01:05:02,614 --> 01:05:04,534
I was taking interest.

1114
01:05:04,694 --> 01:05:05,694
Come on, Sakhi.

1115
01:05:13,168 --> 01:05:14,534
All your goods are ready.

1116
01:05:14,614 --> 01:05:16,934
- Then, you read the list, I will check it.
- Very well.

1117
01:05:17,574 --> 01:05:18,654
- Horlicks.
- Yes.

1118
01:05:18,734 --> 01:05:19,734
- Bournvita.
- Yes.

1119
01:05:20,226 --> 01:05:21,226
Yes.

1120
01:05:21,334 --> 01:05:22,254
Yes.

1121
01:05:22,334 --> 01:05:23,334
Yes.

1122
01:05:23,454 --> 01:05:24,454
Yes.

1123
01:05:24,974 --> 01:05:25,974
Yes.

1124
01:05:27,054 --> 01:05:30,094
Excuse me. Do you see
more Hindi movies?

1125
01:05:30,254 --> 01:05:31,254
No, why?

1126
01:05:31,374 --> 01:05:33,414
Because your voice changed from..

1127
01:05:33,494 --> 01:05:35,510
Sohrab Modi, to Dilip Kumar
to a silent movie era.

1128
01:05:35,534 --> 01:05:38,454
- Give me the list. You check it. I will read it.
- All right.

1129
01:05:38,694 --> 01:05:39,614
- Horlicks.
- Horlicks.

1130
01:05:39,694 --> 01:05:41,294

1131
01:05:41,374 --> 01:05:42,654

1132
01:05:42,894 --> 01:05:43,534
- Benadryl.

1133
01:05:43,614 --> 01:05:46,254
Water based compound.
Vimbram. Becosule.

1134
01:05:46,334 --> 01:05:46,934
Glucose.

1135
01:05:47,014 --> 01:05:48,014
Oxygen cylinder.

1136
01:05:48,374 --> 01:05:49,374
Oxygen cylinder.

1137
01:05:49,814 --> 01:05:51,254
Is the patient very serious?

1138
01:05:51,374 --> 01:05:52,654
Only the doctor knows it.

1139
01:05:52,734 --> 01:05:54,694
But right now, I am very serious.

1140
01:05:55,014 --> 01:05:57,014
- Oh, Good morning, Mr. Rai.
- Good morning.

1141
01:05:57,094 --> 01:05:59,310
All your medicines have been
sent to the mental hospital.

1142
01:05:59,334 --> 01:06:00,694
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1143
01:06:01,774 --> 01:06:04,174
- Sudhir?
- Hey, Hiralal!

1144
01:06:05,574 --> 01:06:07,254
Are you a doctor of
the mental hospital?

1145
01:06:07,334 --> 01:06:08,974
No. I have become
a child specialist.

1146
01:06:09,054 --> 01:06:10,854
- A doctor for children?
- Yes.

1147
01:06:10,934 --> 01:06:13,094
Then I will need you.
Yes, definitely.

1148
01:06:13,294 --> 01:06:15,734
See, please pack these medicines.

1149
01:06:15,854 --> 01:06:17,494
We will go in the adjoining
Chinese room.

1150
01:06:17,574 --> 01:06:19,534
Come, I have some work
there. Come on.

1151
01:06:24,294 --> 01:06:26,214
Please parcel some food,
please take the order.

1152
01:06:26,854 --> 01:06:28,414
Waiter, take the order.

1153
01:06:31,614 --> 01:06:33,294
It is a small place, the
food is good here.

1154
01:06:33,374 --> 01:06:34,494
- Is it?
- Very good.

1155
01:06:34,694 --> 01:06:37,014
Let the menu card be,
take the order.

1156
01:06:37,894 --> 01:06:39,134
Two chicken Manchurian.

1157
01:06:39,694 --> 01:06:40,774
Two chicken chilly.

1158
01:06:41,374 --> 01:06:43,894
Two prawns garlic.
Two fish garlic.

1159
01:06:44,534 --> 01:06:46,014
Two vegetable spring rolls.

1160
01:06:46,414 --> 01:06:48,734
Two crab rolls.
Two chicken rolls.

1161
01:06:48,894 --> 01:06:50,974
And a Chinese chopsuey. That's all.

1162
01:06:52,654 --> 01:06:53,974
Is this a party or something?

1163
01:06:54,054 --> 01:06:56,014
What about the party?
It is food for two.

1164
01:06:56,854 --> 01:06:57,894
So many dishes?

1165
01:06:58,494 --> 01:07:00,390
Where are there so many dishes?
Just eight dishes.

1166
01:07:00,414 --> 01:07:01,694
It is just us two and our eight.

1167
01:07:02,814 --> 01:07:06,094
Actually, one feels hungrier
when one are in love.

1168
01:07:07,294 --> 01:07:09,054
That means that you
have fell in love.

1169
01:07:09,334 --> 01:07:10,854
But you stay in London, isn't it?

1170
01:07:11,054 --> 01:07:13,374
Oh, I see. Love in London.

1171
01:07:13,774 --> 01:07:16,254
No, you don't see. Love in India.

1172
01:07:17,134 --> 01:07:20,614
After dad expired, I got his
settled London business.

1173
01:07:20,894 --> 01:07:23,494
I just had a house here,
which I wanted to sell.

1174
01:07:24,014 --> 01:07:25,654
Now the Bombay tenant didn't give..

1175
01:07:25,734 --> 01:07:29,454
Me the rent for four years.
I reached there.

1176
01:07:29,734 --> 01:07:32,094
And what did I see?
It wasn't a male tenant.

1177
01:07:32,174 --> 01:07:34,134
It was a female tenant.
And what a girl!

1178
01:07:34,614 --> 01:07:36,974
She is a proper dream girl.

1179
01:07:37,254 --> 01:07:39,174
When I gave her the eviction
order in her hands..

1180
01:07:39,294 --> 01:07:41,654
Such huge tears
fell from her eyes.

1181
01:07:42,134 --> 01:07:44,934
She held my hand and said..

1182
01:07:45,694 --> 01:07:48,574
Where will I go, leaving this
house in such a huge world?

1183
01:07:49,294 --> 01:07:50,534
I decided at that time.

1184
01:07:51,014 --> 01:07:53,054
Instead of chucking her
out of this house..

1185
01:07:53,134 --> 01:07:54,814
Why don't I settle
my life with her?

1186
01:07:55,214 --> 01:07:58,574
If she comes to London
as Mrs. Hiralal..

1187
01:07:58,654 --> 01:08:00,294
I will be able to
sell this house..

1188
01:08:00,374 --> 01:08:01,854
And settle my
house in London too.

1189
01:08:02,014 --> 01:08:04,414
But, this is a fantastic idea!
You are a genius.

1190
01:08:04,734 --> 01:08:05,734
Thank you.

1191
01:08:05,814 --> 01:08:07,374
But.. I have a problem.

1192
01:08:07,894 --> 01:08:10,134
You know that there is a
lot of cold in London.

1193
01:08:10,334 --> 01:08:13,334
And Ruby darling has
a permanent cold.

1194
01:08:14,974 --> 01:08:15,894
What did you say?

1195
01:08:15,974 --> 01:08:17,534
Ruby.. Ruby Dutt..

1196
01:08:18,174 --> 01:08:19,934
I am Hiralal, that means
a red diamond.

1197
01:08:20,014 --> 01:08:21,854
And she is a ruby.
Both of us are red diamonds.

1198
01:08:22,134 --> 01:08:24,894
Her father's was
in the army major. Major Dutt.

1199
01:08:25,374 --> 01:08:28,094
Therefore, her brains were
just like army people.

1200
01:08:28,694 --> 01:08:30,174
She doesn't take the
medicines at all.

1201
01:08:30,934 --> 01:08:31,934
I see..

1202
01:08:32,174 --> 01:08:33,654
Just saying I see won't do.

1203
01:08:33,894 --> 01:08:35,614
You must see her and
you must treat her.

1204
01:08:35,814 --> 01:08:37,150
You are a child specialist,
isn't it?

1205
01:08:37,174 --> 01:08:38,614
You will be able to
take care of her.

1206
01:08:38,694 --> 01:08:40,214
She is a couple of
years elder to me.

1207
01:08:40,413 --> 01:08:42,733
But she is just like a child.

1208
01:08:43,694 --> 01:08:45,974
That same arrogance..
That same attitude..

1209
01:08:55,408 --> 01:08:57,150
You just take the luggage
from the seat ahead.

1210
01:08:57,174 --> 01:08:58,614
- Yes, sir.
- Come Sudhir.

1211
01:09:05,894 --> 01:09:08,214
What is this, darling?
I have told you so many times..

1212
01:09:08,613 --> 01:09:09,973
You go up from the bed once again?

1213
01:09:10,374 --> 01:09:11,614
I was taking some brandy.

1214
01:09:12,254 --> 01:09:13,974
See, who has come.

1215
01:09:17,014 --> 01:09:18,014
My friend.

1216
01:09:18,573 --> 01:09:19,973
He has become a big doctor now.

1217
01:09:26,325 --> 01:09:27,577
Come..

1218
01:09:29,854 --> 01:09:32,614
My fiance Ruby!

1219
01:09:39,094 --> 01:09:41,254
It seems.. we have met
somewhere before.

1220
01:09:42,413 --> 01:09:43,533
I don't think so.

1221
01:09:44,054 --> 01:09:47,894
Your voice and your face..
It seems so recognized.

1222
01:09:49,774 --> 01:09:52,494
This happens,
darling, this happens.

1223
01:09:52,573 --> 01:09:53,630
Come on, Sudhir.
Have a seat.

1224
01:09:53,654 --> 01:09:54,654
You sit too, darling.

1225
01:09:55,614 --> 01:09:59,134
See, darling.
We believe in rebirth.

1226
01:10:00,014 --> 01:10:02,574
It is possible that
Sudhir was your..

1227
01:10:02,654 --> 01:10:04,494
Brother-in-law in your
previous birth too.

1228
01:10:04,694 --> 01:10:06,334
Why? What do you say
to that, Sudhir?

1229
01:10:06,494 --> 01:10:08,174
Sometimes, when you meet people..

1230
01:10:09,294 --> 01:10:11,014
For the first times,
we think that..

1231
01:10:11,094 --> 01:10:13,094
We don't know since how
many years we know them.

1232
01:10:14,374 --> 01:10:15,734
And then, there are some..

1233
01:10:16,334 --> 01:10:19,294
Even when they stay all the life..
They seem strangers.

1234
01:10:19,934 --> 01:10:21,374
Correct. Very correct.

1235
01:10:21,614 --> 01:10:23,694
Sudhir.. see if my
darling has fever.

1236
01:10:24,534 --> 01:10:25,534
Let me see your hand.

1237
01:10:43,094 --> 01:10:44,094
Yes.

1238
01:10:44,574 --> 01:10:45,974
Her veins are fast.

1239
01:10:49,334 --> 01:10:50,334
Give her a paper.

1240
01:10:50,614 --> 01:10:52,014
What will it be if not fast?

1241
01:10:52,254 --> 01:10:53,614
She doesn't listen to anyone.

1242
01:10:53,894 --> 01:10:57,334
Didn't I tell you?
She is very military minded.

1243
01:10:58,054 --> 01:11:01,014
Now you have got a correct doctor.
He will cure you.

1244
01:11:04,894 --> 01:11:06,054
Bring this medicine.

1245
01:11:06,374 --> 01:11:09,014
You people chat.
I will return right away.

1246
01:11:21,174 --> 01:11:22,174
Miss Ruby..

1247
01:11:23,134 --> 01:11:24,390
The medicine that Hiralal
went to bring..

1248
01:11:24,414 --> 01:11:25,934
It won't make any
difference to you.

1249
01:11:26,814 --> 01:11:28,094
Then why did you send him?

1250
01:11:30,414 --> 01:11:32,014
To have him move away from here.

1251
01:11:32,854 --> 01:11:33,854
Why?

1252
01:11:35,254 --> 01:11:38,374
I wanted to ask you some questions.

1253
01:11:39,494 --> 01:11:40,494
Yes, please do.

1254
01:11:41,734 --> 01:11:43,374
Hiralal says that
you are often sick.

1255
01:11:49,694 --> 01:11:50,694
I think that..

1256
01:11:52,894 --> 01:11:54,014
What do you think?

1257
01:11:54,734 --> 01:11:56,694
I don't have the guts
to say what I think.

1258
01:11:58,934 --> 01:12:00,014
Then have a brandy.

1259
01:12:00,574 --> 01:12:02,254
You'll become stronger
after a brandy.

1260
01:12:02,654 --> 01:12:03,654
I don't mind.

1261
01:12:11,694 --> 01:12:13,294
Yes. So what do you feel?

1262
01:12:21,033 --> 01:12:23,193
I feel that your illness
is related to your mind.

1263
01:12:23,913 --> 01:12:25,033
- To my mind?
- Yes.

1264
01:12:26,033 --> 01:12:29,353
All of us have a sickness
in the mind.

1265
01:12:30,633 --> 01:12:32,633
Now, look at me.
I have got everything.

1266
01:12:33,353 --> 01:12:34,833
But even then, my mind is moving..

1267
01:12:34,913 --> 01:12:36,993
Around,
god knows in which thirst.

1268
01:12:37,593 --> 01:12:38,713
Don't you think so?

1269
01:12:40,913 --> 01:12:42,833
I will not lie.

1270
01:12:43,833 --> 01:12:44,953
Even I think so.

1271
01:12:46,033 --> 01:12:48,913
What I searched forever in my life,
I didn't get it.

1272
01:12:50,033 --> 01:12:52,873
And what I got, I didn't love it.

1273
01:12:53,126 --> 01:12:54,513
You are right, you are right.

1274
01:12:55,233 --> 01:12:58,193
See, I was very intelligent
in studies.

1275
01:12:59,673 --> 01:13:01,793
I wished that I should pass,
I got the gold medal.

1276
01:13:03,113 --> 01:13:05,393
I thought that I would buy some
Fiat or Ambassador..

1277
01:13:05,913 --> 01:13:07,153
I bought a Mercedes.

1278
01:13:08,155 --> 01:13:10,395
I thought that I would pursue
the profession of a doctor.

1279
01:13:10,713 --> 01:13:13,673
I invested fifty five lakhs
and opened a nursing home.

1280
01:13:14,513 --> 01:13:16,673
And now.. it's cost must
be about a crore.

1281
01:13:16,833 --> 01:13:20,753
But even then.. did my heart
get satisfied? No.

1282
01:13:22,073 --> 01:13:24,913
No?
Why?

1283
01:13:24,993 --> 01:13:25,993
You know, Rubi.

1284
01:13:29,612 --> 01:13:32,207
Well, with money one can buy..

1285
01:13:32,287 --> 01:13:34,953
A Mercedes, a nursing
home and everything else.

1286
01:13:36,193 --> 01:13:38,113
Every luxury of life can be bought.

1287
01:13:38,193 --> 01:13:41,153
But the heart..
That cannot be bought.

1288
01:13:43,193 --> 01:13:45,153
At the most, taking hands in hands,

1289
01:13:47,012 --> 01:13:48,153
the nerves can be seen.

1290
01:13:50,433 --> 01:13:52,753
See, I returned so soon.

1291
01:13:52,989 --> 01:13:54,113
Here is the medicine.

1292
01:13:54,993 --> 01:13:55,993
Here.

1293
01:13:56,513 --> 01:13:57,953
Take two pills after the food.

1294
01:13:58,193 --> 01:13:59,473
And don't have anything cold.

1295
01:14:00,553 --> 01:14:01,553
Another thing.

1296
01:14:01,873 --> 01:14:04,193
My nursing home has it's opening
ceremony tomorrow.

1297
01:14:04,513 --> 01:14:05,913
I will come to take you personally.

1298
01:14:06,397 --> 01:14:07,428
Okay. Then bye.

1299
01:14:07,793 --> 01:14:09,633
We will come on only one condition.

1300
01:14:10,033 --> 01:14:11,553
Ruby is your responsibility
from today.

1301
01:14:11,633 --> 01:14:12,553
You will have to meet her every day.

1302
01:14:12,633 --> 01:14:14,113
He is a busy man. He will forget.

1303
01:14:15,193 --> 01:14:16,193
See Ruby.

1304
01:14:17,673 --> 01:14:20,473
It is a doctor's job to cure.

1305
01:14:20,553 --> 01:14:22,673
Whether it is a friend or foe.

1306
01:14:23,753 --> 01:14:24,753
Bye.

1307
01:14:25,313 --> 01:14:25,793
Bye.

1308
01:14:25,873 --> 01:14:27,393
- Shall I drop you?
- No. I will go.

1309
01:14:31,153 --> 01:14:32,219
Is this the time to come?

1310
01:14:32,477 --> 01:14:33,673
I am very angry with you.

1311
01:14:33,753 --> 01:14:35,793
Ever since I have become
a child specialist..

1312
01:14:35,873 --> 01:14:37,513
I am a bit scared of adults.

1313
01:14:38,033 --> 01:14:39,113
I have got a guest with me.

1314
01:14:40,593 --> 01:14:41,593
Meet my friend..

1315
01:14:43,433 --> 01:14:44,433
Ruby Dutt.

1316
01:14:45,673 --> 01:14:47,713
He is my partner,
Prashant Chaturvedi.

1317
01:14:48,193 --> 01:14:49,673
Mrs. Kavita Chaturvedi.

1318
01:14:50,593 --> 01:14:52,913
Do you remember Hiralal?
The one who was in school with us?

1319
01:14:53,433 --> 01:14:54,713
- Hiralal Tandon?
- Yes.

1320
01:14:54,994 --> 01:14:55,994
She is his fiance.

1321
01:14:56,033 --> 01:14:57,033
Oh. Okay.

1322
01:14:57,113 --> 01:14:58,353
But where is he himself?

1323
01:14:58,433 --> 01:14:59,913
I am here, I am here.

1324
01:15:00,353 --> 01:15:02,193
Many happy returns of the day.

1325
01:15:02,393 --> 01:15:04,993
Just as minute. Meet her first.

1326
01:15:05,233 --> 01:15:06,233
She is my wife, Kavita.

1327
01:15:06,553 --> 01:15:09,273
And another thing is,
Today isn't my birthday.

1328
01:15:11,473 --> 01:15:13,713
Is it? Happy birthday.
May this day come many times.

1329
01:15:13,793 --> 01:15:14,833
It isn't her birthday too.

1330
01:15:14,873 --> 01:15:17,473
Actually, it is the birthday
of our nursing home.

1331
01:15:17,553 --> 01:15:19,033
It had taken birth on this day.

1332
01:15:19,273 --> 01:15:21,233
Oh, so you two are the fathers.

1333
01:15:22,113 --> 01:15:24,313
Excuse me. I will keep
the flowers at this time.

1334
01:15:24,473 --> 01:15:25,953
And I will pray to God..

1335
01:15:26,033 --> 01:15:27,313
This city gets full of sickness.

1336
01:15:27,473 --> 01:15:30,833
So that your nursing
home gets success.

1337
01:15:31,205 --> 01:15:32,350
Thank you so much.

1338
01:15:32,593 --> 01:15:34,640
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

1339
01:15:35,233 --> 01:15:36,353
You have come now?

1340
01:15:36,593 --> 01:15:37,993
I am very angry with you.

1341
01:15:38,113 --> 01:15:39,753
What can I do? I didn't get a taxi.

1342
01:15:39,833 --> 01:15:40,833
I am sorry.

1343
01:15:41,073 --> 01:15:42,593
Nandini.. please have her sit.

1344
01:15:42,873 --> 01:15:45,233
- Yes. Come. Come.
- Yes, darling. You have a seat.

1345
01:15:45,713 --> 01:15:47,433
I will have a chat with
my old friends.

1346
01:15:48,553 --> 01:15:51,673
- Good evening, good evening.
- Good evening, sir.

1347
01:15:51,873 --> 01:15:52,993
Oh, Good evening, sir.

1348
01:15:53,073 --> 01:15:54,529
Sir, it was very nice
of you to come, sir.

1349
01:15:54,553 --> 01:15:56,433
Kavita, he is Dr. Agarwal.

1350
01:15:56,553 --> 01:15:58,209
The biggest heart specialist
in our nursing home.

1351
01:15:58,233 --> 01:15:59,233
Sir, my wife.

1352
01:16:00,113 --> 01:16:01,833
And meet my wife, Meenaxi.

1353
01:16:02,433 --> 01:16:03,793
Oh.. Kavita.. you?

1354
01:16:04,113 --> 01:16:05,393
- How are you?
- Renu!

1355
01:16:05,713 --> 01:16:08,233
Oh, you both know each other?

1356
01:16:08,313 --> 01:16:09,833
Yes, she is my friend
since childhood.

1357
01:16:09,913 --> 01:16:12,984
- Very good.
- Come, sir.

1358
01:16:17,833 --> 01:16:19,553
I thought that
she was his daughter.

1359
01:16:19,633 --> 01:16:20,633
But she is his wife.

1360
01:16:20,713 --> 01:16:21,713
And that too, the third.

1361
01:16:21,873 --> 01:16:22,873
Third?

1362
01:16:23,393 --> 01:16:25,793
Is he a heart specialist,
or a marriage specialist?

1363
01:16:34,433 --> 01:16:35,553
Thank you very much, doctor.

1364
01:16:35,593 --> 01:16:36,593
I'll be needed your help.

1365
01:16:36,753 --> 01:16:38,073
You are most welcome sir.

1366
01:16:38,633 --> 01:16:39,633
Where?

1367
01:16:40,473 --> 01:16:41,353
Excuse me.

1368
01:16:41,433 --> 01:16:43,513
Darling. Your headache
is all right, isn't it?

1369
01:16:44,873 --> 01:16:46,593
- Where do you stay in Mumbai?
- Excuse me..

1370
01:16:46,753 --> 01:16:48,433
Do you want Vicks? I have Vicks.

1371
01:16:48,593 --> 01:16:49,993
- Take it.
- No, thank you.

1372
01:16:51,073 --> 01:16:52,233
I was asking you..

1373
01:16:52,593 --> 01:16:53,473
Do you want to sit here?

1374
01:16:53,553 --> 01:16:54,073
Yes.

1375
01:16:54,153 --> 01:16:55,153
Sit here.

1376
01:16:55,193 --> 01:16:56,473
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1377
01:17:00,833 --> 01:17:02,313
Darling, you are happy isn't it?

1378
01:17:02,513 --> 01:17:03,513
Yes.

1379
01:17:12,393 --> 01:17:16,153
Ladies and gentlemen,
I don't like this party.

1380
01:17:16,513 --> 01:17:18,273
Because all of you are
speaking seriously.

1381
01:17:18,353 --> 01:17:20,553
And parties are given
for fun and fluoric.

1382
01:17:21,353 --> 01:17:23,073
Therefore, I propose..

1383
01:17:23,153 --> 01:17:26,313
That I present a song to you.

1384
01:17:26,513 --> 01:17:28,833
Yes! Very good.

1385
01:17:29,193 --> 01:17:32,313
And with that, the one
who will sing be will be dance.

1386
01:17:37,755 --> 01:17:40,881
Dance..

1387
01:17:44,593 --> 01:17:45,793
Mrs. Kavita Chaturvedi.

1388
01:17:46,473 --> 01:17:47,953
What insolence is this?

1389
01:17:48,513 --> 01:17:50,113
Let go of my hand. Let go. Let go!

1390
01:17:51,473 --> 01:17:55,753
She has abused me saying
that I am insolent.

1391
01:17:56,433 --> 01:17:59,113
Now. I have already
had a couple of pegs.

1392
01:18:00,273 --> 01:18:06,473
If I really flirt with her in the
intoxication will I be wrong?

1393
01:18:06,673 --> 01:18:08,808
No.. not at all.. not at all.

1394
01:18:09,071 --> 01:18:11,513
If Mrs. Kavita doesn't
wish that, forget her.

1395
01:18:11,713 --> 01:18:12,993
Why don't you sing us a song?

1396
01:18:13,073 --> 01:18:14,233
Yes. I will sing it.

1397
01:18:14,633 --> 01:18:16,113
Look, I don't have any tantrums.

1398
01:18:16,513 --> 01:18:19,313
Please have a seat.
I will get ready..

1399
01:18:24,113 --> 01:18:26,513
Your Sudhir drank and
broke the story.

1400
01:18:27,433 --> 01:18:28,433
What story?

1401
01:18:28,953 --> 01:18:30,593
There is something
wrong between them.

1402
01:18:31,873 --> 01:18:33,713
They must be dancing at
home like this too.

1403
01:18:34,833 --> 01:18:36,913
If he did this with me..

1404
01:18:37,713 --> 01:18:40,073
I would have whipped him
and taught him a lesson.

1405
01:18:58,473 --> 01:19:05,433
"I am angry on someone
for something."

1406
01:19:06,321 --> 01:19:12,113
"I am alive, but angry with life."

1407
01:19:14,433 --> 01:19:20,873
"I am angry on someone
for something."

1408
01:19:21,833 --> 01:19:28,193
"I am alive, but angry with life."

1409
01:19:29,113 --> 01:19:34,513
"I am angry on someone
for something."

1410
01:19:34,913 --> 01:19:40,473
"I am angry on someone
for something."

1411
01:19:58,393 --> 01:20:04,233
"I think that I have complaints
against friends."

1412
01:20:08,953 --> 01:20:14,193
"I think that I have complaints
against friends."

1413
01:20:14,393 --> 01:20:19,273
"I think that I love enemies."

1414
01:20:19,513 --> 01:20:24,513
"I am angry with this
friendship and enmity."

1415
01:20:24,713 --> 01:20:29,633
"I am angry with this
friendship and enmity."

1416
01:20:29,833 --> 01:20:34,873
"I am angry on
someone for something."

1417
01:20:35,233 --> 01:20:41,953
"I am angry on
someone for something."

1418
01:20:42,713 --> 01:20:48,873
"I am alive, but angry with life."

1419
01:21:06,473 --> 01:21:11,993
"I don't know where I see whom?"

1420
01:21:16,253 --> 01:21:22,353
"I don't know where I see whom?"

1421
01:21:22,553 --> 01:21:27,553
"But whomever I see whenever.."

1422
01:21:27,753 --> 01:21:32,833
"They think that I am
angry with them."

1423
01:21:33,033 --> 01:21:37,253
"They think that I am
angry with them."

1424
01:21:38,273 --> 01:21:43,513
"I am angry on someone
for something."

1425
01:21:43,713 --> 01:21:50,033
"I am angry on someone
for something."

1426
01:21:51,513 --> 01:21:58,233
"I am alive, but angry with life."

1427
01:21:58,993 --> 01:22:03,953
"I am angry on someone
for something."

1428
01:22:04,873 --> 01:22:10,233
"I am angry on someone
for something."

1429
01:22:27,913 --> 01:22:29,753
Keep the car here. I will return.

1430
01:22:40,073 --> 01:22:42,233
- Good morning, Miss Malhotra.
- Good morning.

1431
01:22:42,633 --> 01:22:43,313
Is Prashant free?

1432
01:22:43,393 --> 01:22:44,753
Yes, he is free. Please go.

1433
01:22:44,833 --> 01:22:45,833
I will go. I will go.

1434
01:22:46,190 --> 01:22:47,633
First you tell me. How are you?

1435
01:22:47,713 --> 01:22:48,713
I am all right.

1436
01:22:48,913 --> 01:22:50,273
- You are all right?
- Yes.

1437
01:22:52,113 --> 01:22:55,753
This means that you are
a Malhotra from UP.

1438
01:22:56,137 --> 01:22:58,184
Definitely not.
I am from Punjab. Why?

1439
01:22:58,713 --> 01:23:01,153
Because you said like this.

1440
01:23:02,353 --> 01:23:04,353
The people from UP are
a bit arrogant..

1441
01:23:04,433 --> 01:23:06,513
About their Hindi,
which has it's origins in Urdu.

1442
01:23:06,873 --> 01:23:09,273
It is said that by the
time the argument..

1443
01:23:09,353 --> 01:23:11,009
About whether the word
British is male..

1444
01:23:11,033 --> 01:23:12,913
Or female in the court
of Wajid Ali Shah..

1445
01:23:13,073 --> 01:23:15,673
The britishers had
taken over Awadh.

1446
01:23:16,553 --> 01:23:18,089
But this isn't the case
with the Punjabis.

1447
01:23:18,113 --> 01:23:19,473
Wherever these people stop..

1448
01:23:19,553 --> 01:23:21,833
They say all right and move about.

1449
01:23:22,673 --> 01:23:24,593
As it is, I like the fifty
percent Punjabis more.

1450
01:23:24,713 --> 01:23:25,833
And the rest of them?

1451
01:23:25,953 --> 01:23:27,913
- The rest of them are males, isn't it?
- Yes.

1452
01:23:28,313 --> 01:23:30,833
I like this fifty percent more.

1453
01:23:31,233 --> 01:23:32,913
You speak just like children.

1454
01:23:32,993 --> 01:23:34,489
I am the doctor for children,
therefore.

1455
01:23:34,513 --> 01:23:35,993
- Okay, bye.
- Listen.

1456
01:23:37,113 --> 01:23:38,233
Tell me something.

1457
01:23:38,433 --> 01:23:40,513
Where did you learn such
a nice song from?

1458
01:23:41,513 --> 01:23:42,513
If you keep meeting me..

1459
01:23:42,580 --> 01:23:44,513
You will learn many other
talents from me..

1460
01:23:45,073 --> 01:23:46,609
Not Miss Malhotra,
you can call me Nandini.

1461
01:23:46,633 --> 01:23:48,081
And my name is Sudhir.

1462
01:23:48,993 --> 01:23:51,273
Even I have some talents,
Mr. Sudhir.

1463
01:23:51,553 --> 01:23:52,809
Should I show it to you right now?

1464
01:23:52,833 --> 01:23:54,793
What? You will sing here?
In the nursing home?

1465
01:23:54,873 --> 01:23:57,553
No. I make very nice coffee.

1466
01:23:57,633 --> 01:24:01,368
Oh God I'm ruined.

1467
01:24:01,448 --> 01:24:02,448
Why?

1468
01:24:02,913 --> 01:24:04,833
Coffee is my biggest weakness.

1469
01:24:05,193 --> 01:24:06,273
Whichever woman wants me..

1470
01:24:06,353 --> 01:24:07,809
Can treat me to coffee
and win me over.

1471
01:24:07,833 --> 01:24:09,793
Okay. You meet the doctor.

1472
01:24:10,153 --> 01:24:12,193
I will try to win you over.

1473
01:24:12,433 --> 01:24:13,433
Okay.

1474
01:24:14,593 --> 01:24:15,593
But..

1475
01:24:15,953 --> 01:24:17,913
I like sugar.

1476
01:24:18,233 --> 01:24:19,233
Okay.

1477
01:24:26,273 --> 01:24:27,873
- Good morning, doctor.
- Morning.

1478
01:24:28,253 --> 01:24:30,953
What happened?
Why did you call me all of a sudden?

1479
01:24:31,393 --> 01:24:32,993
I didn't call you,
Kavita has called you.

1480
01:24:33,033 --> 01:24:34,889
She has called you some
ten times since morning.

1481
01:24:34,913 --> 01:24:37,633
Yes. I have unplugged my telephone.

1482
01:24:38,193 --> 01:24:38,833
Why?

1483
01:24:38,913 --> 01:24:40,273
Because I fear your wife.

1484
01:24:40,353 --> 01:24:41,833
I just held her hand
a bit yesterday..

1485
01:24:41,873 --> 01:24:42,889
And she has become so angry?

1486
01:24:42,913 --> 01:24:45,393
Yes, she is very angry.
Go and convince her.

1487
01:24:45,913 --> 01:24:47,673
Why do you have to be
so angry in this?

1488
01:24:48,033 --> 01:24:50,473
No. I will have to tell Prashant
to check your blood pressure.

1489
01:24:51,073 --> 01:24:52,673
The blood pressure will
be checked later.

1490
01:24:53,073 --> 01:24:54,113
First you tell me.

1491
01:24:54,353 --> 01:24:55,993
Why did you hold my hand and..

1492
01:24:56,073 --> 01:24:57,753
Tell me to dance in
everyone's presence?

1493
01:24:57,953 --> 01:24:59,089
You should have told me that you..

1494
01:24:59,113 --> 01:25:01,193
Didn't like to hold hands,
I would hold your feet.

1495
01:25:01,553 --> 01:25:04,073
See. Sudhir. There is
a limit to jokes too.

1496
01:25:04,873 --> 01:25:06,793
Mr. Agarwal's wife had come
today in the morning.

1497
01:25:06,953 --> 01:25:09,233
Do you know what
Ruby Dutt tell her?

1498
01:25:09,713 --> 01:25:10,713
What?

1499
01:25:10,833 --> 01:25:13,313
That you unfolded all the
story in your intoxication.

1500
01:25:13,673 --> 01:25:16,073
Wow.. as if it isn't a story,
but some heart.

1501
01:25:16,593 --> 01:25:18,329
It was broken and there
wasn't any sound. Like that..

1502
01:25:18,353 --> 01:25:19,113
What was the story?

1503
01:25:19,193 --> 01:25:19,953
Just that..

1504
01:25:20,033 --> 01:25:21,553
You dance with me..

1505
01:25:21,953 --> 01:25:23,593
That you have some affair with me.

1506
01:25:23,833 --> 01:25:24,833
Wow..

1507
01:25:24,953 --> 01:25:26,273
The girl seems intelligent.

1508
01:25:26,553 --> 01:25:29,153
How nicely, she has found out.
I am her fan.

1509
01:25:29,633 --> 01:25:31,593
You will be her fan later.

1510
01:25:32,473 --> 01:25:33,913
Do you what she said after that?

1511
01:25:34,313 --> 01:25:37,513
That if you acted like
this with her..

1512
01:25:37,993 --> 01:25:40,233
She would have whipped and
taught you a lesson.

1513
01:25:42,033 --> 01:25:43,033
A whip?

1514
01:25:47,833 --> 01:25:50,273
Let me see where Ruby
Dutt's whip is?

1515
01:25:52,033 --> 01:25:54,713
Sudhir Rai is living
to search that whip.

1516
01:26:02,673 --> 01:26:03,673
Hello.

1517
01:26:05,193 --> 01:26:07,193
You found time to come
after so many days?

1518
01:26:07,553 --> 01:26:09,593
How did Mrs. Kavita Chaturvedi
give you time?

1519
01:26:10,113 --> 01:26:12,273
- I was thinking that..
- Enough.

1520
01:26:12,713 --> 01:26:13,873
Let me talk to.

1521
01:26:15,353 --> 01:26:17,193
I was thinking that
you had forgotten me.

1522
01:26:17,513 --> 01:26:20,033
This is great. I can forget myself.

1523
01:26:20,113 --> 01:26:21,753
But Ruby Dutt. Never.

1524
01:26:22,673 --> 01:26:24,873
I just thought that
when Hiralal is not here..

1525
01:26:25,233 --> 01:26:27,273
Is it proper
for us to meet here?

1526
01:26:27,433 --> 01:26:30,113
Silent, has Hirala bought me?

1527
01:26:30,673 --> 01:26:32,113
I am the owner of My decisions.

1528
01:26:33,593 --> 01:26:35,673
I was thinking that you
were angry with me.

1529
01:26:36,165 --> 01:26:38,329
Otherwise, why didn't you come
to meet me for so many days?

1530
01:26:38,353 --> 01:26:39,673
You are strange too, madam!

1531
01:26:39,753 --> 01:26:40,953
What do you mean by Madam.

1532
01:26:41,633 --> 01:26:42,633
Can you call me Ruby?

1533
01:26:42,993 --> 01:26:44,753
Okay, Ruby..

1534
01:26:45,553 --> 01:26:47,873
It was just a matter of yesterday..
Just a day.

1535
01:26:48,153 --> 01:26:49,153
One day?

1536
01:26:50,073 --> 01:26:52,073
Do you know how many hours
are there in a day?

1537
01:26:52,393 --> 01:26:53,393
Twenty four.

1538
01:26:53,873 --> 01:26:57,153
The twenty four hours of wait are
bigger than twenty four years.

1539
01:26:57,633 --> 01:27:01,153
Please forgive me,
please forgive me.

1540
01:27:01,473 --> 01:27:03,153
I agree that I am the guilty.

1541
01:27:04,313 --> 01:27:06,513
I bow my head and wait
for my punishment.

1542
01:27:07,193 --> 01:27:11,261
Take me in my embrace,
that is my punishment.

1543
01:27:58,633 --> 01:28:05,706
"One day.. I will yearn
and clutch my heart.."

1544
01:28:05,921 --> 01:28:12,705
"One day.. I will yearn
and clutch my heart.."

1545
01:28:12,934 --> 01:28:19,073
"My beloved killer..
I will take your name.."

1546
01:28:19,704 --> 01:28:22,673
"I will take your name."

1547
01:28:23,282 --> 01:28:25,993
"I will take your name."

1548
01:28:26,832 --> 01:28:33,593
"One day.. I will yearn
and clutch my heart.."

1549
01:28:33,902 --> 01:28:39,953
"My beloved killer..
I will take your name.."

1550
01:28:40,593 --> 01:28:43,913
"I will take your name."

1551
01:28:44,113 --> 01:28:47,713
"I will take your name."

1552
01:29:12,473 --> 01:29:15,840
"You woke me up.."

1553
01:29:16,141 --> 01:29:19,113
"I won't let you sleep."

1554
01:29:19,590 --> 01:29:26,116
"I won't let you smile or cry."

1555
01:29:26,503 --> 01:29:29,753
"You woke me up.."

1556
01:29:29,913 --> 01:29:32,993
"I won't let you sleep."

1557
01:29:33,313 --> 01:29:39,913
"I won't let you smile or cry."

1558
01:29:40,233 --> 01:29:43,313
"I will give you some message."

1559
01:29:43,713 --> 01:29:46,873
"I will take some message."

1560
01:29:47,193 --> 01:29:53,513
"My beloved killer..
I will take your name.."

1561
01:29:54,033 --> 01:29:57,113
"I will take your name."

1562
01:29:57,353 --> 01:30:00,513
"I will take your name."

1563
01:30:15,033 --> 01:30:21,553
"You wouldn't get
my love like this."

1564
01:30:21,994 --> 01:30:28,753
"You will have to give
the price of love."

1565
01:30:28,833 --> 01:30:35,273
"You wouldn't get
my love like this."

1566
01:30:35,753 --> 01:30:42,313
"You will have to give
the price of love."

1567
01:30:42,593 --> 01:30:45,913
"I will not deal."

1568
01:30:46,073 --> 01:30:49,393
"I will use my heart to decide."

1569
01:30:49,604 --> 01:30:55,713
"My beloved killer..
I will take your name.."

1570
01:30:56,231 --> 01:30:59,251
"I will take your name."

1571
01:30:59,709 --> 01:31:03,033
"I will take your name."

1572
01:31:06,993 --> 01:31:10,273
You have a really fantastic
sense of humor, Mr. Agarwal.

1573
01:31:10,587 --> 01:31:12,713
Therefore Julius Caesar has said..

1574
01:31:12,793 --> 01:31:15,182
Let me have men around
me who are fat.

1575
01:31:15,668 --> 01:31:17,953
Let me have men around
me who are fat.

1576
01:31:20,478 --> 01:31:21,393
Excuse me.

1577
01:31:21,473 --> 01:31:22,953
Good evening..
Good evening, doctor.

1578
01:31:23,033 --> 01:31:24,553
- Good evening.
- Thank you for coming.

1579
01:31:24,633 --> 01:31:25,953
- Congrats.
- Thank you very much.

1580
01:31:26,073 --> 01:31:27,473
I am very much honored that..

1581
01:31:27,553 --> 01:31:29,753
You took out time
to come in my party.

1582
01:31:29,833 --> 01:31:32,833
This is great. There is such a
huge event in your life today.

1583
01:31:32,913 --> 01:31:34,673
And I won't come during
such a great event?

1584
01:31:34,753 --> 01:31:37,313
Yes. Not only this, there will
be another great event.

1585
01:31:37,433 --> 01:31:39,393
And you not only
have come for that.

1586
01:31:39,473 --> 01:31:41,375
You have to stay there
and do everything.

1587
01:31:41,455 --> 01:31:42,553
What is that?

1588
01:31:43,473 --> 01:31:44,473
Operation.

1589
01:31:44,753 --> 01:31:46,033
Operation? Whose?

1590
01:31:46,473 --> 01:31:48,033
Ruby's.. she will have a caesarean.

1591
01:31:48,353 --> 01:31:51,208
Forgive me. It is your
engagement today.

1592
01:31:53,633 --> 01:31:55,673
Have you.. before the engagement?

1593
01:31:55,753 --> 01:31:57,793
Oh! Doctor..
Nothing to worry about.

1594
01:31:57,873 --> 01:32:00,913
The key to successful
life is planning.

1595
01:32:00,993 --> 01:32:02,833
See. We are engaged today.

1596
01:32:02,913 --> 01:32:04,633
In some days, we will be married.

1597
01:32:04,713 --> 01:32:08,553
In some days, she will conceive.
She has an advanced age.

1598
01:32:08,833 --> 01:32:11,633
And because she is older,
she will have a cesarean.

1599
01:32:11,713 --> 01:32:13,233
And because nobody else does..

1600
01:32:13,313 --> 01:32:15,233
A cesarean better than
you in this city..

1601
01:32:15,313 --> 01:32:17,209
Therefore, you will have
to do this operation.

1602
01:32:17,233 --> 01:32:20,993
- Oh sure.. sure..
- Thank you, doctor.

1603
01:32:21,273 --> 01:32:23,073
We will have a drink
on that. Sawant..

1604
01:32:23,153 --> 01:32:24,793
- Drink for the doctor.
- On the rocks.

1605
01:32:25,033 --> 01:32:26,033
Hello.

1606
01:32:26,748 --> 01:32:28,065
Hello.

1607
01:32:28,313 --> 01:32:29,873
The teacher hasn't come as yet?

1608
01:32:51,793 --> 01:32:52,793
Govinda?

1609
01:32:54,993 --> 01:32:55,993
Yes?

1610
01:33:04,633 --> 01:33:06,393
Hi.. welcome.. welcome..

1611
01:33:06,473 --> 01:33:08,089
- Greetings. - Greetings.
- Welcome. - Flower.

1612
01:33:08,113 --> 01:33:09,273
Thank you.

1613
01:33:09,353 --> 01:33:11,753
- Please take your seats.
- Congratulations.

1614
01:33:12,713 --> 01:33:13,473
Sudhir didn't come?

1615
01:33:13,553 --> 01:33:16,616
- He is here..
- Hi!

1616
01:33:17,553 --> 01:33:20,033
Where is the bride?
I mean.. the to be bride.

1617
01:33:20,113 --> 01:33:24,113
You have a seat, I will come.

1618
01:33:24,593 --> 01:33:26,713
Ruby.. Ruby.. darling..

1619
01:33:28,313 --> 01:33:31,993
Come on. Ruby darling.. come on..

1620
01:33:37,233 --> 01:33:40,233
You look so nice, fabulous.

1621
01:33:40,513 --> 01:33:41,791
Thank you.

1622
01:33:42,633 --> 01:33:44,553
Now, garland each other.

1623
01:33:44,833 --> 01:33:46,033
What is the need for that?

1624
01:33:46,313 --> 01:33:48,873
There is a need for that.
It is the done thing.

1625
01:33:56,433 --> 01:33:57,673
Thank you. Thank you

1626
01:33:57,753 --> 01:33:59,193
Sudhir, please take your seat.

1627
01:33:59,793 --> 01:34:01,569
Darling, you speak to them
and give him company.

1628
01:34:01,593 --> 01:34:02,913
I will organize everything.

1629
01:34:03,601 --> 01:34:04,793
- Sawant?
- Yes?

1630
01:34:04,873 --> 01:34:06,153
Bring four drinks here.

1631
01:34:06,633 --> 01:34:08,753
What are you doing here? Come
on, run away from here!

1632
01:34:08,953 --> 01:34:12,593
Mr. Hiralal, you are
being so excited.

1633
01:34:12,713 --> 01:34:15,873
Excited? And me? Not at all

1634
01:34:16,033 --> 01:34:19,513
Come on, please sit. I will
tell you about excitement.

1635
01:34:21,873 --> 01:34:24,273
Hiralal, it is your
engagement party.

1636
01:34:24,353 --> 01:34:25,969
Why don't you put some
music or something?

1637
01:34:25,993 --> 01:34:26,993
Oh of course..

1638
01:34:27,233 --> 01:34:28,713
- Abdul.
- Yes, sir?

1639
01:34:28,793 --> 01:34:30,633
- The stereo please.
- Yes, sir.

1640
01:34:35,593 --> 01:34:36,793
Shall we dance?

1641
01:34:37,113 --> 01:34:38,393
Dr. Agarwal, shall we dance?

1642
01:34:38,473 --> 01:34:41,873
- Sure! Sure!
- Yes. - Come on darling.

1643
01:34:42,802 --> 01:34:46,753
- Hey!
- The light?

1644
01:34:47,353 --> 01:34:50,193
- Check someone. - Abdul.. Abdul!
- Everyone stand where you are.

1645
01:34:50,273 --> 01:34:52,993
The glasses will break,
the plates will break.

1646
01:35:09,113 --> 01:35:10,393
Where is that whip?

1647
01:35:13,673 --> 01:35:16,873
- This light had to go today only?
- Call someone to see.

1648
01:35:17,350 --> 01:35:19,033
- Strange.
- What happened?

1649
01:35:19,113 --> 01:35:22,033
- Put the fuse on.
- Light has come.

1650
01:35:25,073 --> 01:35:26,913
- What happened?
- The fuse had conked off?

1651
01:35:26,993 --> 01:35:29,073
- It will not go now?
- No, sir. - Now you go.

1652
01:35:29,153 --> 01:35:30,633
Then come on, we will
resume dancing.

1653
01:35:30,713 --> 01:35:32,513
I will..
Ruby..

1654
01:35:33,953 --> 01:35:34,953
Ruby darling..

1655
01:35:35,193 --> 01:35:36,673
Ruby.. where did this Ruby go?

1656
01:35:37,633 --> 01:35:40,193
Ruby.. Ruby darling..

1657
01:35:41,673 --> 01:35:43,913
Ruby.. Ruby darling..

1658
01:35:44,273 --> 01:35:45,313
Where she has gone?

1659
01:35:46,633 --> 01:35:49,673
What happened to you?

1660
01:35:49,753 --> 01:35:51,273
Nothing. I just fainted.

1661
01:35:51,353 --> 01:35:52,393
Are you all right?

1662
01:35:52,473 --> 01:35:54,233
- Take me upstairs.
- Come on.

1663
01:35:54,993 --> 01:35:56,529
Ladies and gentlemen..
Please excuse me.

1664
01:35:56,553 --> 01:35:57,873
Prashant.. just a minute.

1665
01:36:18,593 --> 01:36:20,993
Sakhi.. hey Sakhi..

1666
01:36:21,673 --> 01:36:22,553
I am here.

1667
01:36:22,633 --> 01:36:23,713
Oh! Are you here?

1668
01:36:24,513 --> 01:36:26,993
What is the matter? Why did you
call me at this unearthly time?

1669
01:36:28,113 --> 01:36:29,273
Where were you since morning?

1670
01:36:29,953 --> 01:36:31,273
Did you call me to ask this much?

1671
01:36:31,673 --> 01:36:33,833
No. I wanted to ask
something else too.

1672
01:36:34,913 --> 01:36:37,433
How did the lights suddenly
go in the party yesterday?

1673
01:36:38,193 --> 01:36:39,313
How will I know that?

1674
01:36:39,633 --> 01:36:40,633
Am I an electrician?

1675
01:36:41,473 --> 01:36:43,673
What were you talking with
Ruby Dutt's servant?

1676
01:36:44,106 --> 01:36:45,353
Why did you give him money?

1677
01:36:47,073 --> 01:36:50,273
Very good, Sakhi..
I must respect you.

1678
01:36:51,233 --> 01:36:52,433
You must have been in the CBI.

1679
01:36:53,873 --> 01:36:55,753
You caught Sudhir Rai so well.

1680
01:36:56,393 --> 01:36:57,873
And I thought that was very smart.

1681
01:36:59,473 --> 01:37:00,473
Yes, Sakhi..

1682
01:37:01,753 --> 01:37:02,793
Honestly..

1683
01:37:04,073 --> 01:37:05,833
I had shut the lights off.

1684
01:37:07,233 --> 01:37:08,233
Why?

1685
01:37:08,513 --> 01:37:12,433
I wanted to see where Ruby
had hidden the whip.

1686
01:37:13,753 --> 01:37:15,473
Govinda shut the main switch here.

1687
01:37:16,353 --> 01:37:17,473
And there was darkness here.

1688
01:37:18,073 --> 01:37:19,193
There was darkness here..

1689
01:37:19,713 --> 01:37:21,633
And I took Ruby Dutt in my embrace.

1690
01:37:21,913 --> 01:37:22,913
Did she not shout?

1691
01:37:23,633 --> 01:37:24,633
She tried.

1692
01:37:25,073 --> 01:37:26,313
But I shut her mouth.

1693
01:37:26,753 --> 01:37:27,753
How?

1694
01:37:28,713 --> 01:37:29,993
Now, as this riddle.

1695
01:37:30,993 --> 01:37:34,073
When my hands were full..
How would I have closed her mouth?

1696
01:37:35,993 --> 01:37:38,913
My mouth was free..

1697
01:37:39,633 --> 01:37:40,753
My lips were free.

1698
01:37:41,633 --> 01:37:43,633
I used them.

1699
01:37:44,393 --> 01:37:46,049
I took her to the bedroom,
thrust her on the bed.

1700
01:37:46,073 --> 01:37:47,073
And I asked her..

1701
01:37:49,753 --> 01:37:51,273
Tell me, where is that Ruby?

1702
01:37:52,473 --> 01:37:53,953
Apologize.. apologize..

1703
01:37:54,033 --> 01:37:55,033
- To whom?
- To me.

1704
01:37:55,273 --> 01:37:56,073
Why from you.

1705
01:37:56,153 --> 01:37:58,697
Think that I am Ruby Dutt
and apologize to me.

1706
01:38:01,273 --> 01:38:04,033
- And I should ask forgiveness from you?
- Yes.

1707
01:38:05,433 --> 01:38:07,353
Then I will have to
commit the mistake..

1708
01:38:07,433 --> 01:38:09,193
That I did with Ruby Dutt too.

1709
01:38:09,273 --> 01:38:12,633
Shame on you, You have
become such a disgusting man.

1710
01:38:14,353 --> 01:38:15,593
You are so lowly now?

1711
01:38:16,713 --> 01:38:18,433
Ruby Dutt is your friend's fiance.

1712
01:38:20,170 --> 01:38:21,873
With your friend's to be wife..

1713
01:38:24,833 --> 01:38:26,353
I had such faith in you.

1714
01:38:27,433 --> 01:38:31,753
But you..
You absolutely stunned me.

1715
01:38:32,913 --> 01:38:35,433
Go away from here.

1716
01:38:36,393 --> 01:38:37,976
Don't come to me ever again.

1717
01:38:41,597 --> 01:38:44,793
Okay. I am going, I will never come
to you ever again.

1718
01:38:44,873 --> 01:38:46,553
But before going, I have a request.

1719
01:38:47,833 --> 01:38:49,193
Come with me.

1720
01:38:49,273 --> 01:38:50,273
Where?

1721
01:38:52,193 --> 01:38:53,193
Come.

1722
01:38:54,233 --> 01:38:56,793
Where have you brought me?
This is a mental hospital.

1723
01:38:56,873 --> 01:38:59,833
Don't ask me anything.
Just watch what's happening

1724
01:39:11,553 --> 01:39:12,553
Brother..

1725
01:39:17,793 --> 01:39:20,833
- Yes?
- I.. I am Sudhir..

1726
01:39:22,953 --> 01:39:24,353
Sudhir..

1727
01:39:29,393 --> 01:39:30,473
Sudhir..

1728
01:39:33,353 --> 01:39:36,793
Son of that unfortunate
school teacher.

1729
01:39:42,633 --> 01:39:44,913
Your name shouldn't be Sudhir.

1730
01:39:47,873 --> 01:39:50,793
Your name should have been Adhir.

1731
01:39:53,153 --> 01:39:54,593
And my name should have been..

1732
01:39:56,151 --> 01:39:58,273
Should have been.. 'Gardhab'.

1733
01:40:00,673 --> 01:40:01,673
Means a 'Donkey'.

1734
01:40:02,233 --> 01:40:03,313
The same matter once again.

1735
01:40:03,793 --> 01:40:06,393
- You are so educated and..
- How does education help?

1736
01:40:09,393 --> 01:40:12,382
How does education help? Nothing.

1737
01:40:14,553 --> 01:40:15,553
Nothing.

1738
01:40:16,433 --> 01:40:18,593
The real thing is not education.

1739
01:40:18,673 --> 01:40:20,273
The real thing is money.

1740
01:40:21,993 --> 01:40:22,993
Money.

1741
01:40:24,313 --> 01:40:25,673
Therefore, I was whipped.

1742
01:40:27,353 --> 01:40:29,393
Therefore, the dog was left on me.

1743
01:40:30,193 --> 01:40:32,393
Therefore, Ruby Dutt said
and everyone agreed.

1744
01:40:32,713 --> 01:40:34,033
Nobody heard me out.

1745
01:40:35,073 --> 01:40:36,073
Sudhir..

1746
01:40:36,913 --> 01:40:38,633
You don't believe
what everyone says?

1747
01:40:39,273 --> 01:40:40,513
You believe me, isn't it?

1748
01:40:40,753 --> 01:40:41,753
Yes, brother.

1749
01:40:41,833 --> 01:40:43,473
Then, why don't you take revenge?

1750
01:40:44,673 --> 01:40:46,993
I will. I will certainly.

1751
01:40:47,553 --> 01:40:48,553
Yes.

1752
01:40:49,353 --> 01:40:50,353
Yes.

1753
01:40:51,553 --> 01:40:54,873
Take a whip.

1754
01:40:56,433 --> 01:40:58,793
And hit her back. Like she hit me.

1755
01:41:04,473 --> 01:41:05,913
She had hit me so hard.

1756
01:41:08,553 --> 01:41:10,793
I was teaching Ruby Dutt history.

1757
01:41:11,673 --> 01:41:13,673
History makes the other kings.

1758
01:41:14,313 --> 01:41:16,113
But emperor Ashoka was
one of those kings..

1759
01:41:16,193 --> 01:41:17,713
Who themselves make history.

1760
01:41:18,913 --> 01:41:22,513
Seven the biggest of kings were at
his beck and call in his court.

1761
01:41:22,793 --> 01:41:24,315
How many wives did king Ashok have?

1762
01:41:24,395 --> 01:41:26,793
- Yes?
- Yes? I asked..

1763
01:41:26,993 --> 01:41:28,673
How many wives did king Ashok have?

1764
01:41:28,913 --> 01:41:29,913
I have heard..

1765
01:41:29,953 --> 01:41:32,073
The kings and emperors have
thousands of keeps?

1766
01:41:32,193 --> 01:41:35,553
Yes.. I was saying..

1767
01:41:36,153 --> 01:41:37,513
About emperor Ashok.

1768
01:41:37,593 --> 01:41:39,673
Please don't skirt
the issue. Tell me.

1769
01:41:40,273 --> 01:41:44,833
What is the need of
concubine when having a wife?

1770
01:41:46,313 --> 01:41:49,513
The reason is lust.

1771
01:41:49,913 --> 01:41:51,473
This means, physical desire?

1772
01:41:52,513 --> 01:41:53,513
Yes.

1773
01:41:53,673 --> 01:41:56,473
I have heard that this thirst..

1774
01:41:56,993 --> 01:41:58,369
Increases, as it is
tried to be decreased?

1775
01:41:58,393 --> 01:41:59,393
You have heard right.

1776
01:41:59,953 --> 01:42:03,793
So, what is the cure of this
non decreasing thirst?

1777
01:42:06,165 --> 01:42:07,753
By concentrating on something else.

1778
01:42:08,513 --> 01:42:09,913
And if one cannot concentrate?

1779
01:42:10,273 --> 01:42:11,273
See, Ruby..

1780
01:42:14,473 --> 01:42:16,209
- What's the matter?
- It seems there is a worm inside..

1781
01:42:16,233 --> 01:42:17,873
- Please open my zip..
- Zip?

1782
01:42:21,513 --> 01:42:23,993
Why don't you look at me?
Do I not seem good?

1783
01:42:24,713 --> 01:42:26,513
Ruby see..
Should not talk like this.

1784
01:42:27,113 --> 01:42:28,313
Why are you so arrogant?

1785
01:42:28,473 --> 01:42:30,873
So many boys run after me.

1786
01:42:31,162 --> 01:42:32,473
I don't even look at them.

1787
01:42:32,873 --> 01:42:34,033
I look at you.

1788
01:42:34,273 --> 01:42:36,049
And you tell me things
about Ashoka the great.

1789
01:42:36,073 --> 01:42:37,473
To hell with Ashoka the Great.

1790
01:42:37,793 --> 01:42:38,833
Life is little.

1791
01:42:38,913 --> 01:42:41,433
Listen to me.. listen to me..

1792
01:42:42,153 --> 01:42:45,873
- I.. I..
- What is this?

1793
01:42:48,273 --> 01:42:50,353
See, papa.. he was forcing me..

1794
01:42:51,913 --> 01:42:54,713
- You rascal.. how dare you?
- No.. no..

1795
01:42:54,793 --> 01:42:57,073
Papa.. if you weren't there..

1796
01:42:57,313 --> 01:42:58,609
I don't know what would
have happened today.

1797
01:42:58,633 --> 01:42:59,753
Ruby, what are you doing?

1798
01:43:00,513 --> 01:43:03,313
You wretch..
You forgot your status.

1799
01:43:08,673 --> 01:43:12,391
Dutt sir, you..

1800
01:43:12,833 --> 01:43:13,833
I will not..

1801
01:43:14,433 --> 01:43:15,673
Tiger..

1802
01:43:17,802 --> 01:43:21,353
- No!
- Brother.

1803
01:43:23,873 --> 01:43:24,873
Who?

1804
01:43:26,353 --> 01:43:27,353
Sudhir..

1805
01:43:30,193 --> 01:43:31,193
Sudhir..

1806
01:43:33,353 --> 01:43:35,033
You should avenge me.

1807
01:43:37,473 --> 01:43:38,953
Avenge me, okay?

1808
01:43:43,353 --> 01:43:44,673
Avenge me, Sudhir.

1809
01:43:47,473 --> 01:43:48,753
Avenge me, surely.

1810
01:44:06,713 --> 01:44:08,073
Please forgive me, Sudhir.

1811
01:44:08,913 --> 01:44:09,833
Do you know?

1812
01:44:09,913 --> 01:44:13,033
He has been telling this story
to me since fifteen years.

1813
01:44:14,393 --> 01:44:15,993
You can understand how Ruby Dutt..

1814
01:44:16,073 --> 01:44:19,873
Must have tortured him.
He speaks of revenge.

1815
01:44:21,433 --> 01:44:22,433
Sudhir..

1816
01:44:23,073 --> 01:44:24,593
Will brother get fifteen
years back..

1817
01:44:24,673 --> 01:44:25,932
If you take revenge?

1818
01:44:26,393 --> 01:44:27,673
Forget this revenge.

1819
01:44:27,953 --> 01:44:29,033
No. Never.

1820
01:44:29,993 --> 01:44:31,056
In the book of the heart..

1821
01:44:31,136 --> 01:44:33,873
Life is avenged by life
and dignity by dignity.

1822
01:44:34,913 --> 01:44:37,073
If anyone snatches
anything from me..

1823
01:44:37,153 --> 01:44:38,793
I don't rest until
I don't ruin them.

1824
01:44:39,873 --> 01:44:41,273
Ruby Dutt is not
my friend's fiance.

1825
01:44:41,313 --> 01:44:42,593
She is the killer of my brother.

1826
01:44:44,513 --> 01:44:46,513
If you want to break you relation
with me on this..

1827
01:44:46,543 --> 01:44:47,553
You are free to do so.

1828
01:44:51,123 --> 01:44:53,814
Come on, let's go home.

1829
01:45:04,633 --> 01:45:05,633
Kavita.

1830
01:45:05,993 --> 01:45:10,913
These are forty thousand
rupees, keep them.

1831
01:45:14,153 --> 01:45:15,873
Where do you get all
this money from?

1832
01:45:16,873 --> 01:45:18,753
Our biggest tragedy is that..

1833
01:45:19,393 --> 01:45:21,953
No man is a hero in his wife's eye.

1834
01:45:23,513 --> 01:45:26,233
Not a single room of our
hospital is empty.

1835
01:45:26,993 --> 01:45:28,953
People book it three
months in advance.

1836
01:45:30,273 --> 01:45:33,673
Why don't you put this
money in the bank?

1837
01:45:34,833 --> 01:45:37,113
What is the need of keeping
so much cash at home?

1838
01:45:37,593 --> 01:45:39,113
I am doing what everyone is.

1839
01:45:39,393 --> 01:45:41,033
This isn't any new. Keep it.

1840
01:46:02,033 --> 01:46:03,033
Yes, Ruby..

1841
01:46:06,273 --> 01:46:07,273
Darling..

1842
01:46:08,033 --> 01:46:09,233
Everything is all right.

1843
01:46:10,193 --> 01:46:13,033
Come to my house, at seven
thirty in the evening..

1844
01:46:13,713 --> 01:46:15,753
With just a little
bit of your luggage.

1845
01:46:16,713 --> 01:46:20,673
And then we will go far
away to settle away.

1846
01:46:23,169 --> 01:46:25,913
But remember it today.

1847
01:46:26,233 --> 01:46:28,153
Exactly at seven thirty.

1848
01:46:28,993 --> 01:46:31,073
You told me that you will give..

1849
01:46:31,433 --> 01:46:33,433
Me such a surprise,
my life will change.

1850
01:46:33,753 --> 01:46:35,993
But I can just see
the time changing.

1851
01:46:37,109 --> 01:46:38,393
Have some patience.

1852
01:46:40,273 --> 01:46:42,673
My blood pressure increases
due to suspense.

1853
01:46:43,473 --> 01:46:48,793
Everything will be taken care
of with the end of this suspense.

1854
01:46:49,033 --> 01:46:50,433
Really? Shake hands.

1855
01:46:50,513 --> 01:46:52,153
Not now. Sit quietly now.

1856
01:46:52,433 --> 01:46:53,513
Where now?

1857
01:46:53,953 --> 01:46:56,593
This will be the case
till my marriage.

1858
01:46:57,753 --> 01:46:58,953
Do you love her so much?

1859
01:47:00,033 --> 01:47:02,673
What will you know about love?

1860
01:47:03,593 --> 01:47:04,953
And that too, love with Ruby?

1861
01:47:05,953 --> 01:47:08,473
I will take a drop of
my heart's blood..

1862
01:47:08,553 --> 01:47:10,273
And have Ruby wear a
ring on my marriage.

1863
01:47:10,993 --> 01:47:12,513
Does Ruby love you this much too?

1864
01:47:13,833 --> 01:47:15,353
Is this to be asked?

1865
01:47:16,193 --> 01:47:18,913
She says that she cannot tolerate
a moment's separation.

1866
01:47:19,913 --> 01:47:20,913
Is it?

1867
01:47:22,033 --> 01:47:24,393
Come on. Get ready for the
surprise. Hide there.

1868
01:47:30,713 --> 01:47:31,713
Have you come?

1869
01:47:31,833 --> 01:47:33,353
Yes, darling, I am ready.

1870
01:47:33,753 --> 01:47:35,393
Tell me, where will you take me?

1871
01:47:36,073 --> 01:47:37,713
For the last time, think about it..

1872
01:47:38,793 --> 01:47:42,793
You are sure to run
away with me forever?

1873
01:47:43,233 --> 01:47:44,249
How many times should I tell you?

1874
01:47:44,273 --> 01:47:45,713
I cannot live without you.

1875
01:47:46,513 --> 01:47:48,353
My present, my future.

1876
01:47:48,793 --> 01:47:49,913
You are everything.

1877
01:47:51,313 --> 01:47:54,033
Do you really not love Hiralal?

1878
01:47:54,193 --> 01:47:56,273
Sudhir.. how can you expect that?

1879
01:47:56,593 --> 01:47:59,953
Can anyone love a half
crazy dull nitwit?

1880
01:48:00,833 --> 01:48:02,673
Come on. Don't delay any further.

1881
01:48:07,793 --> 01:48:12,833
I don't have any idea to
come with you anywhere.

1882
01:48:13,113 --> 01:48:15,073
Sudhir. Don't joke now.

1883
01:48:15,673 --> 01:48:17,833
That mad man can come
here searching for us.

1884
01:48:27,233 --> 01:48:28,313
Hey.. listen..

1885
01:48:29,513 --> 01:48:31,273
Why don't you thank me?

1886
01:48:33,033 --> 01:48:34,033
No, friend.

1887
01:48:34,753 --> 01:48:37,273
After you showed me the
truth of this true love..

1888
01:48:38,713 --> 01:48:41,433
I will not want to thank
and insult you.

1889
01:48:47,233 --> 01:48:49,073
Now, I understood all this.

1890
01:48:50,233 --> 01:48:52,045
Were you playing with me?

1891
01:48:52,125 --> 01:48:53,553
Then, what did you think?

1892
01:48:54,273 --> 01:48:57,193
Can only you play with
anyone's heart?

1893
01:48:57,873 --> 01:49:00,253
- You..
- Silent..

1894
01:49:03,513 --> 01:49:04,633
Tell me something.

1895
01:49:07,873 --> 01:49:10,073
Do you know anyone
called Adhir Rai?

1896
01:49:10,913 --> 01:49:12,393
Adhir.. Rai?

1897
01:49:13,313 --> 01:49:14,313
Yes.

1898
01:49:15,433 --> 01:49:17,033
Do you remember?

1899
01:49:18,993 --> 01:49:20,833
I am his younger brother.

1900
01:49:25,593 --> 01:49:27,033
Do you want to know..

1901
01:49:27,553 --> 01:49:28,753
Where he is now?

1902
01:49:30,633 --> 01:49:31,793
He is in a mad house.

1903
01:49:32,873 --> 01:49:33,873
Yes.

1904
01:49:34,673 --> 01:49:35,673
A mad house.

1905
01:49:36,394 --> 01:49:37,913
And do you know since when?

1906
01:49:39,313 --> 01:49:44,793
Since the day your father lashed
him and got him bitten by mad dogs.

1907
01:49:46,113 --> 01:49:47,873
Since that day, he is
in the mad house.

1908
01:49:48,993 --> 01:49:50,553
And whenever I went to meet him..

1909
01:49:51,793 --> 01:49:53,273
Do you know what he tells me?

1910
01:49:53,873 --> 01:49:54,873
They saying Sudhir..

1911
01:49:55,993 --> 01:49:56,993
Revenge.

1912
01:49:58,033 --> 01:49:59,033
Revenge.

1913
01:49:59,833 --> 01:50:01,913
Sudhir.. be sure to take revenge.

1914
01:50:02,713 --> 01:50:05,233
Okay. Then you took revenge?

1915
01:50:06,993 --> 01:50:07,993
Yes.

1916
01:50:08,993 --> 01:50:09,993
Revenge.

1917
01:50:12,553 --> 01:50:14,193
Now, will you please
go away from here?

1918
01:50:15,313 --> 01:50:16,313
Please!

1919
01:50:26,753 --> 01:50:27,793
- Dr. Dubey?
- Yes?

1920
01:50:28,353 --> 01:50:29,833
I don't have American degree.

1921
01:50:30,393 --> 01:50:31,553
But I can tell you.

1922
01:50:31,913 --> 01:50:34,513
This delivery didn't
need a cesarean.

1923
01:50:34,793 --> 01:50:36,033
This is what I think too.

1924
01:50:36,353 --> 01:50:38,786
The deliveries taking place
in this nursing home..

1925
01:50:38,866 --> 01:50:41,113
Ninety percent of
them can be normal.

1926
01:50:41,793 --> 01:50:44,433
I don't know why he does a
cesarean without any use?

1927
01:50:44,713 --> 01:50:46,753
There is a reason.

1928
01:50:47,433 --> 01:50:48,273
Money.

1929
01:50:48,353 --> 01:50:50,753
See. A cesarean means fees, and..

1930
01:50:50,913 --> 01:50:53,273
Even the fees of staying
in the nursing home.

1931
01:50:53,673 --> 01:50:55,073
That means.. more profit..

1932
01:50:59,953 --> 01:51:01,353
This is a very big racket.

1933
01:51:01,993 --> 01:51:03,793
And now, we can tell this truth..

1934
01:51:04,273 --> 01:51:06,753
- Because we are leaving the job here.
- What?

1935
01:51:06,913 --> 01:51:09,113
We had taken a hypocritic
oath in medical college.

1936
01:51:09,593 --> 01:51:10,913
We took an oath of service.

1937
01:51:11,273 --> 01:51:12,873
But we are not serving here.

1938
01:51:12,993 --> 01:51:14,273
We are selling our conscience.

1939
01:51:14,433 --> 01:51:15,433
Selling conscience?

1940
01:51:15,633 --> 01:51:18,113
What are you talking about?

1941
01:51:18,513 --> 01:51:20,393
You must be reading..
In the newspapers.

1942
01:51:21,153 --> 01:51:23,673
Legal abortions take place
for eighty-ninety rupees.

1943
01:51:24,513 --> 01:51:25,741
Then, why do we charge thousands..

1944
01:51:25,765 --> 01:51:27,793
For an abortion in
the nursing home?

1945
01:51:29,233 --> 01:51:30,833
This money is taken
of helplessness.

1946
01:51:31,673 --> 01:51:34,073
Unmarried women or married..

1947
01:51:34,473 --> 01:51:36,713
Women with affairs
give this money.

1948
01:51:37,513 --> 01:51:38,953
You open the register once and see.

1949
01:51:39,033 --> 01:51:40,793
How many names and addresses
are wrong.

1950
01:51:41,753 --> 01:51:42,873
And for God's sake.

1951
01:51:43,153 --> 01:51:45,513
Don't say that Dr. Chaturvedi
doesn't know this.

1952
01:51:52,593 --> 01:51:54,073
- Laxmi..
- Yes?

1953
01:51:54,633 --> 01:51:55,633
See who it is.

1954
01:51:59,993 --> 01:52:01,513
- Is madam at home?
- She is there.

1955
01:52:02,033 --> 01:52:03,713
Tell her that Nandini
Malhotra has come.

1956
01:52:04,233 --> 01:52:06,273
Nandini.. please come..

1957
01:52:09,193 --> 01:52:11,713
Come.. have a seat.

1958
01:52:16,833 --> 01:52:17,913
What is the matter?

1959
01:52:18,833 --> 01:52:21,473
What I was about to tell you..

1960
01:52:22,193 --> 01:52:24,633
I was first going to tell
you in this letter.

1961
01:52:25,433 --> 01:52:28,193
Then I thought, I'd talk
to you if I meet you.

1962
01:52:29,233 --> 01:52:30,233
Tell me.

1963
01:52:31,433 --> 01:52:32,753
You must have seen..

1964
01:52:33,073 --> 01:52:34,203
There has been such a progress..

1965
01:52:34,227 --> 01:52:36,313
In the nursing home
in such a short while.

1966
01:52:36,673 --> 01:52:40,993
So soon.. how can this
progress take place?

1967
01:52:42,233 --> 01:52:43,833
From where did
this money come from?

1968
01:52:45,833 --> 01:52:47,409
I have written the same
thing in the letter..

1969
01:52:47,433 --> 01:52:48,993
That Dr. Chaturvedi has wandered..

1970
01:52:49,073 --> 01:52:52,073
From the path of both, his
profession and his humanity.

1971
01:52:54,273 --> 01:52:57,033
You have tried
to accuse my husband.

1972
01:52:57,953 --> 01:52:59,353
Do you have any proof for that?

1973
01:53:00,713 --> 01:53:02,633
The biggest proof is that..

1974
01:53:03,073 --> 01:53:06,233
I have come personally
to tell this to you.

1975
01:53:07,353 --> 01:53:09,233
I can tell you the names
of two doctors..

1976
01:53:09,593 --> 01:53:11,393
Who have resigned
for the same reason.

1977
01:53:12,113 --> 01:53:14,873
I know the names and addresses
of some of the girls too.

1978
01:53:15,273 --> 01:53:16,393
But think about it.

1979
01:53:16,753 --> 01:53:18,193
The matter which
they want to hide..

1980
01:53:18,273 --> 01:53:19,889
And therefore come
to Neo nursing home..

1981
01:53:19,913 --> 01:53:21,633
Why will they tell it to you?

1982
01:53:23,213 --> 01:53:26,873
But whether you believe it or not.

1983
01:53:27,553 --> 01:53:28,953
It doesn't make any difference.

1984
01:53:29,193 --> 01:53:30,953
Who says that it doesn't
make any difference?

1985
01:53:31,171 --> 01:53:33,193
The letter you have written
with your own hands..

1986
01:53:33,753 --> 01:53:37,353
It will be presented in the case
of defamation against you.

1987
01:53:38,113 --> 01:53:41,593
And you will be lost in
the darkness of defamy.

1988
01:53:45,553 --> 01:53:47,553
I am darkness myself.

1989
01:53:48,353 --> 01:53:49,753
I don't fear infamy.

1990
01:53:50,473 --> 01:53:53,193
Because I have tasted it.

1991
01:53:53,993 --> 01:53:55,273
You must remember.

1992
01:53:55,713 --> 01:53:57,193
A girl from your college ran away..

1993
01:53:57,913 --> 01:54:00,073
With some boy all of a sudden.

1994
01:54:00,793 --> 01:54:01,953
It was a scandal.

1995
01:54:03,193 --> 01:54:04,193
That girl..

1996
01:54:05,393 --> 01:54:06,393
It is me.

1997
01:54:07,113 --> 01:54:08,343
Nandini Malhotra.

1998
01:54:09,633 --> 01:54:10,633
Yes.

1999
01:54:10,673 --> 01:54:11,873
And the boy was..

2000
01:54:12,193 --> 01:54:14,393
The famous playboy Vikram Sarin.

2001
01:54:17,593 --> 01:54:21,210
I wanted to settle down,
become a wife.

2002
01:54:22,713 --> 01:54:24,513
Become a mother.

2003
01:54:25,753 --> 01:54:30,873
He made me a mother without
making me a wife.

2004
01:54:32,513 --> 01:54:34,473
I wanted to have that
child even then.

2005
01:54:35,873 --> 01:54:39,993
But what about the wishes and
non wishes of a poor girl?

2006
01:54:41,233 --> 01:54:45,056
A specialist was called upon.

2007
01:54:45,793 --> 01:54:49,665
He told me that the doctor
will just examine you.

2008
01:54:50,713 --> 01:54:52,199
I was rendered unconscious.

2009
01:54:52,833 --> 01:54:54,233
When I regained my conscious..

2010
01:54:55,113 --> 01:54:56,113
I knew..

2011
01:54:57,637 --> 01:55:00,473
My child was killed.

2012
01:55:03,073 --> 01:55:05,193
I got infamy instead of the child.

2013
01:55:06,033 --> 01:55:08,193
Therefore, I am not
scared of courts.

2014
01:55:08,873 --> 01:55:10,833
But yes. I am sure.

2015
01:55:11,313 --> 01:55:14,153
Running such a huge nursing home..

2016
01:55:14,633 --> 01:55:16,793
Your husband will not want
to be stuck in a scandal.

2017
01:55:19,393 --> 01:55:21,673
Take this, this is a diary.

2018
01:55:23,913 --> 01:55:28,033
There is all the story
in this diary.

2019
01:55:29,113 --> 01:55:31,033
There is a lot of injustice
in this nursing home.

2020
01:55:31,833 --> 01:55:33,233
With the names and addresses..

2021
01:55:33,593 --> 01:55:35,193
There are some
case histories too.

2022
01:55:38,393 --> 01:55:40,389
Whatever happened with me..

2023
01:55:40,833 --> 01:55:43,473
That shouldn't take place
with any other girl.

2024
01:55:44,193 --> 01:55:46,313
Therefore, please look
after your husband.

2025
01:55:46,873 --> 01:55:51,113
You are pure and sinless.

2026
01:55:52,713 --> 01:55:55,593
I don't want to say anything
more than this.

2027
01:56:21,873 --> 01:56:23,130
- Excuse me, sister.
- Yes?

2028
01:56:23,393 --> 01:56:24,633
My name is Vikram Sarin.

2029
01:56:25,233 --> 01:56:27,753
And I have an appointment
with Dr. Chaturvedi.

2030
01:56:28,513 --> 01:56:29,913
Kindly let him know
that I have come

2031
01:56:30,033 --> 01:56:32,433
- Please wait. I will find out.
- Sure.

2032
01:56:35,673 --> 01:56:36,713
Good morning sir.

2033
01:56:37,073 --> 01:56:38,753
There is some Vikram Sarin.

2034
01:56:38,833 --> 01:56:40,433
He says that he has an appointment.

2035
01:56:41,633 --> 01:56:42,633
All right, sir.

2036
01:56:44,073 --> 01:56:45,073
Come.

2037
01:56:47,777 --> 01:56:49,473
- Go straight up from here.
- Thank you.

2038
01:56:49,752 --> 01:56:50,868
It's okay.

2039
01:56:56,873 --> 01:56:58,033
May I come in, doctor?

2040
01:56:58,593 --> 01:57:00,473
Please come, Mr. Sarin.
Have a seat.

2041
01:57:05,433 --> 01:57:06,433
Mr. Sarin.

2042
01:57:07,553 --> 01:57:09,193
I have looked after your patient.

2043
01:57:10,033 --> 01:57:11,073
She is pregnant.

2044
01:57:12,123 --> 01:57:13,713
It is the fifth month.
It is too late.

2045
01:57:14,793 --> 01:57:16,513
I don't want to take
the responsibility..

2046
01:57:16,593 --> 01:57:18,273
Of the abortion in such a matter.

2047
01:57:20,193 --> 01:57:21,193
See, doctor.

2048
01:57:21,953 --> 01:57:24,393
This is the question of my and
the girls' family's dignity.

2049
01:57:25,313 --> 01:57:26,673
The girl is unmarried.

2050
01:57:27,193 --> 01:57:29,513
If the abortion doesn't take
place she will commit suicide.

2051
01:57:30,073 --> 01:57:32,033
Therefore, the abortion
will have to be done.

2052
01:57:32,233 --> 01:57:34,473
If you don't do it,
someone else will.

2053
01:57:36,033 --> 01:57:37,513
I am, willing to pay your price.

2054
01:57:38,033 --> 01:57:39,753
What will you take? Five thousand?

2055
01:57:40,233 --> 01:57:42,153
Ten thousand? Fifteen thousand?

2056
01:57:46,913 --> 01:57:47,913
Okay.

2057
01:57:48,793 --> 01:57:49,793
Admit her.

2058
01:57:53,073 --> 01:57:54,593
Sudhir.. Sudhir..

2059
01:57:55,793 --> 01:57:56,969
Nandini.. You here at this time?

2060
01:57:56,993 --> 01:57:59,953
I am choking here.. take
me away from here.

2061
01:58:02,553 --> 01:58:03,593
What is the matter?

2062
01:58:04,273 --> 01:58:06,913
I had told you everything
about my life.

2063
01:58:07,633 --> 01:58:10,953
The sin from which
I wanted to run away..

2064
01:58:11,833 --> 01:58:14,513
It is happening all around me.

2065
01:58:15,193 --> 01:58:17,833
Please save me with this
nursing home.. please!

2066
01:59:53,753 --> 01:59:54,993
- She is dead.
- What?

2067
01:59:56,393 --> 01:59:57,393
I had told you.

2068
01:59:58,273 --> 01:59:59,313
There is a danger in this.

2069
02:00:02,633 --> 02:00:03,633
Here.

2070
02:00:04,633 --> 02:00:06,193
I will write the death certificate.

2071
02:00:06,833 --> 02:00:08,313
Burn the dead body immediately.

2072
02:01:01,873 --> 02:01:02,873
Police?

2073
02:01:03,273 --> 02:01:04,273
Police?

2074
02:01:05,233 --> 02:01:06,233
You called the police up?

2075
02:01:06,313 --> 02:01:08,593
I didn't do anything wrong
if I called the police.

2076
02:01:09,113 --> 02:01:10,113
Sudhir..

2077
02:01:10,433 --> 02:01:12,313
The man who committed
a murder in my womb..

2078
02:01:12,393 --> 02:01:14,193
And rendered my life barren..

2079
02:01:15,113 --> 02:01:19,593
That same man murdered
another girl today.

2080
02:01:20,513 --> 02:01:24,153
At the hands of Dr. Chaturvedi.

2081
02:01:24,753 --> 02:01:26,433
Yes, Dr. Chaturvedi.

2082
02:01:27,073 --> 02:01:31,313
And he got fifteen
thousand for this.

2083
02:01:32,993 --> 02:01:34,833
I told you earlier.

2084
02:01:34,913 --> 02:01:36,673
What was happening in
this nursing home.

2085
02:01:37,273 --> 02:01:39,113
I had told Mrs. Kavita too.

2086
02:01:39,313 --> 02:01:40,753
I gave her a diary.

2087
02:01:41,313 --> 02:01:43,793
Which had an account of what
happened in this nursing home.

2088
02:01:44,913 --> 02:01:47,593
But even after this, you
didn't do anything.

2089
02:01:49,793 --> 02:01:51,273
That diary, which has the proof..

2090
02:01:51,353 --> 02:01:53,113
Of Prashant's guilt,
does Kavita have it?

2091
02:01:53,673 --> 02:01:54,553
Yes.

2092
02:01:54,673 --> 02:01:55,953
No. We should be having it.

2093
02:01:59,553 --> 02:02:00,553
And listen..

2094
02:02:00,953 --> 02:02:03,833
The abortion file, is that
in the hospital too?

2095
02:02:04,252 --> 02:02:05,252
Yes.

2096
02:02:05,593 --> 02:02:07,193
We should be having that too.

2097
02:02:08,143 --> 02:02:10,193
Then, we will have all
the clues. Come on.

2098
02:03:00,033 --> 02:03:01,233
Why are you sitting like this?

2099
02:03:01,513 --> 02:03:02,713
Are you all right?

2100
02:03:03,473 --> 02:03:04,673
I just have a head ache.

2101
02:03:05,393 --> 02:03:06,553
Do you have a fever?

2102
02:03:06,633 --> 02:03:09,193
No. Didn't I tell you?
I just have a head ache.

2103
02:03:18,513 --> 02:03:19,513
Dr. Chaturvedi.

2104
02:03:23,633 --> 02:03:24,633
What?

2105
02:03:27,993 --> 02:03:29,713
How did this happen?
Who gave the news?

2106
02:03:31,480 --> 02:03:33,033
I will come right away.

2107
02:03:35,833 --> 02:03:36,833
What happened?

2108
02:03:37,353 --> 02:03:38,774
There is an emergency case.

2109
02:04:02,193 --> 02:04:03,473
Hello? Neo Nursing home?

2110
02:04:04,073 --> 02:04:05,553
I am Mrs. Chaturvedi speaking.

2111
02:04:05,873 --> 02:04:09,033
Can you tell me what the matter is?
There was some call.

2112
02:04:09,713 --> 02:04:12,073
As soon as he heard it,
he left the house.

2113
02:04:12,473 --> 02:04:15,233
Yes, I had called.
There is some bad news.

2114
02:04:15,633 --> 02:04:17,513
There was an operation
at six in the evening.

2115
02:04:17,873 --> 02:04:19,553
The patient died on
the operation table.

2116
02:04:20,073 --> 02:04:21,353
When her family went to the..

2117
02:04:21,433 --> 02:04:22,969
Crematorium to perform
her last rites..

2118
02:04:22,993 --> 02:04:25,393
The police came and confiscated
the dead body.

2119
02:04:25,593 --> 02:04:27,353
They have taken it away
for post mortem.

2120
02:04:27,673 --> 02:04:29,953
Then.. please inform Dr. Sudhir.

2121
02:04:30,433 --> 02:04:32,793
I tried a lot.
But he isn't available.

2122
02:04:33,233 --> 02:04:35,633
Like that, he knows about
the patient dying.

2123
02:04:35,953 --> 02:04:37,369
Because he came to
the nursing home..

2124
02:04:37,393 --> 02:04:38,769
Exactly half an hour after that.

2125
02:04:38,793 --> 02:04:41,393
And God knows where he went with
Miss Malhotra after that.

2126
02:04:44,033 --> 02:04:46,953
Can you tell me..
What the operation was about?

2127
02:04:47,233 --> 02:04:48,433
I am sorry.

2128
02:04:59,233 --> 02:05:00,673
Miss Susheela, take this key.

2129
02:05:01,113 --> 02:05:02,953
And burn that file.

2130
02:05:03,153 --> 02:05:04,633
Dr. Rai has taken that file, sir.

2131
02:05:05,073 --> 02:05:07,673
Sudhir? Why did Sudhir take it?
When did he take it?

2132
02:05:08,033 --> 02:05:09,873
He came here half an
hour after you left.

2133
02:05:10,073 --> 02:05:11,953
He went out with Miss Malhotra.

2134
02:05:12,233 --> 02:05:15,673
He came and went to the
office and took the file.

2135
02:05:15,753 --> 02:05:17,233
Why did you let him take the file?

2136
02:05:17,313 --> 02:05:18,593
How can I refuse?

2137
02:05:18,873 --> 02:05:19,953
He is your partner.

2138
02:05:20,113 --> 02:05:21,913
He has a key to the safe too.

2139
02:05:29,170 --> 02:05:30,704
Now I understand.

2140
02:05:31,953 --> 02:05:33,393
Who told the police everything.

2141
02:05:52,153 --> 02:05:52,753
Hello?

2142
02:05:52,833 --> 02:05:55,153
Can I speak to Dr. Sudhir
Rai of the children's ward?

2143
02:05:55,473 --> 02:05:56,473
I am here.

2144
02:06:02,913 --> 02:06:04,713
What is the matter?
Why are you staring at me?

2145
02:06:04,833 --> 02:06:06,833
You don't know?

2146
02:06:08,713 --> 02:06:09,873
What do I not know?

2147
02:06:10,113 --> 02:06:11,473
See. Don't joke.

2148
02:06:12,235 --> 02:06:13,913
You went with Nandini
to the nursing home.

2149
02:06:13,993 --> 02:06:17,833
Okay. You are talking
about that case?

2150
02:06:18,393 --> 02:06:20,113
I can't do anything about it.

2151
02:06:21,153 --> 02:06:22,633
See. This had to happen one day.

2152
02:06:23,233 --> 02:06:25,233
Now, Sudhir isn't a small kid.

2153
02:06:25,793 --> 02:06:30,353
Loss or victory is a
part of the battle of life.

2154
02:06:31,273 --> 02:06:32,473
There is danger in this game.

2155
02:06:32,553 --> 02:06:34,313
And therefore, I am
enjoying playing it.

2156
02:06:35,913 --> 02:06:41,113
I thought you were our support.

2157
02:06:42,713 --> 02:06:44,353
Therefore, I have come here.

2158
02:06:45,353 --> 02:06:47,353
One should use brains in
the times of trouble.

2159
02:06:48,913 --> 02:06:50,313
Please prepare a cup of tea for me.

2160
02:06:50,393 --> 02:06:51,753
I will think till then.

2161
02:06:53,913 --> 02:06:54,913
Please go!

2162
02:07:47,356 --> 02:07:48,713
What are you doing here?

2163
02:07:54,033 --> 02:07:55,873
- I am searching for that diary.
- Which diary?

2164
02:07:57,033 --> 02:07:59,393
Which has all of Prashant's
antics written.

2165
02:07:59,993 --> 02:08:00,993
About Nandini.

2166
02:08:03,313 --> 02:08:04,313
Get lost.

2167
02:08:05,393 --> 02:08:06,673
Don't be adamant.

2168
02:08:07,393 --> 02:08:09,353
- I want that diary.
- I tell you. Get lost!

2169
02:08:22,113 --> 02:08:23,113
Wow!

2170
02:08:24,433 --> 02:08:25,633
What a diary.

2171
02:08:26,633 --> 02:08:27,993
Only proof.

2172
02:08:28,793 --> 02:08:31,993
You too, Dr. Chaturvedi.

2173
02:08:42,513 --> 02:08:44,353
I thought that you were god.

2174
02:08:44,720 --> 02:08:45,873
But today, I found out..

2175
02:08:45,953 --> 02:08:50,793
That I am a devil,
a demon and a beast?

2176
02:08:51,713 --> 02:08:54,193
Then don't try to fight this beast.

2177
02:08:55,993 --> 02:08:59,193
Give me the key to the almirah.

2178
02:09:05,553 --> 02:09:06,953
I understand today.

2179
02:09:07,793 --> 02:09:09,273
Why you said it that day..

2180
02:09:10,713 --> 02:09:12,153
If anything is stolen from you..

2181
02:09:12,993 --> 02:09:15,833
You cannot rest in peace
till you don't ruin that.

2182
02:09:16,673 --> 02:09:18,473
Prashant took you from me.

2183
02:09:19,033 --> 02:09:20,313
He snatched me from you.

2184
02:09:20,873 --> 02:09:22,753
Therefore, you have come
to avenge, isn't it?

2185
02:09:28,513 --> 02:09:29,513
Sakhi..

2186
02:09:31,113 --> 02:09:33,753
You took so long to understand
such a small matter?

2187
02:09:36,273 --> 02:09:37,713
Even after look at my gaze..

2188
02:09:37,793 --> 02:09:40,633
You didn't understand how
I yearned not getting you?

2189
02:09:41,873 --> 02:09:44,593
Couldn't you see your destruction
in the fire in those eyes?

2190
02:09:45,553 --> 02:09:46,913
What kind of a woman are you?

2191
02:09:48,433 --> 02:09:51,513
You don't have anything
as gratitude in you.

2192
02:09:52,753 --> 02:09:55,673
You have lived on the
scrapes of this house.

2193
02:09:55,753 --> 02:10:00,153
A person's heart melts with
tears, Mrs. Chaturvedi.

2194
02:10:00,913 --> 02:10:01,913
Not beasts.

2195
02:10:04,753 --> 02:10:06,513
Don't waste these tears.

2196
02:10:26,113 --> 02:10:28,353
- Dr. Chaturvedi?
- Yes?

2197
02:10:28,513 --> 02:10:30,193
You are under arrest, follow me.

2198
02:10:55,254 --> 02:10:56,254
Hello?

2199
02:10:56,313 --> 02:10:57,993
- Mrs. Chaturvedi?
- Yes?

2200
02:10:58,713 --> 02:11:01,033
The police arrested
Dr. Chaturvedi right now?

2201
02:11:11,833 --> 02:11:12,833
Nandini..

2202
02:11:13,273 --> 02:11:15,393
- Have you come? Dr. Chaturvedi was..
- Yes.

2203
02:11:15,833 --> 02:11:16,833
Yes.

2204
02:11:17,353 --> 02:11:18,553
Prashant was caught.

2205
02:11:20,673 --> 02:11:21,953
But I can be trapped too.

2206
02:11:23,073 --> 02:11:24,753
I am a fifty percent partner,
isn't it?

2207
02:11:25,873 --> 02:11:29,873
I don't want any witness of
this case to be around.

2208
02:11:32,873 --> 02:11:35,154
Take these ten thousand rupees
and leave Bombay right now.

2209
02:11:35,353 --> 02:11:36,353
Why?

2210
02:11:36,393 --> 02:11:37,593
I will not go.

2211
02:11:38,073 --> 02:11:39,753
I want to see with my own eyes.

2212
02:11:40,433 --> 02:11:43,273
When the court sentences
Dr. Chaturvedi..

2213
02:11:43,673 --> 02:11:45,593
How the color
of his face changes.

2214
02:11:47,713 --> 02:11:50,873
You seem very excited.

2215
02:11:53,049 --> 02:11:54,073
That's bad.

2216
02:11:56,833 --> 02:11:57,873
That's very bad.

2217
02:11:59,833 --> 02:12:04,593
I will have to do something
so silent you.

2218
02:12:08,233 --> 02:12:09,633
I will give you this injection.

2219
02:12:10,073 --> 02:12:12,313
What kind of injection is this?

2220
02:12:12,873 --> 02:12:14,113
A very normal injection.

2221
02:12:15,313 --> 02:12:16,553
Without any medicine.

2222
02:12:18,233 --> 02:12:19,953
There is just some air in it.

2223
02:12:21,993 --> 02:12:26,073
I will press this against
your nerve..

2224
02:12:27,113 --> 02:12:30,793
And put a small bubble
of air in your body.

2225
02:12:31,753 --> 02:12:36,513
This bubble will move
slowly to your heart.

2226
02:12:37,353 --> 02:12:40,353
- And then, darkness.
- No Sudhir.

2227
02:12:42,273 --> 02:12:43,713
You will not have any trouble.

2228
02:12:44,913 --> 02:12:47,473
And there will be no
proof against me.

2229
02:12:47,873 --> 02:12:49,233
Sudhir!

2230
02:13:15,907 --> 02:13:18,073
What have you come here for now?
This body?

2231
02:13:22,153 --> 02:13:23,153
You?

2232
02:13:27,313 --> 02:13:29,033
The police left you?

2233
02:13:30,513 --> 02:13:31,513
Yes.

2234
02:13:33,313 --> 02:13:34,873
So much happened in so less a time.

2235
02:13:36,113 --> 02:13:37,913
I was about to confess
my crime when..

2236
02:13:38,993 --> 02:13:39,993
Sudhir arrived.

2237
02:13:45,751 --> 02:13:49,033
Modern Jesus Christ.

2238
02:13:49,633 --> 02:13:52,553
Is ready to carry the
burden of the world.

2239
02:13:59,553 --> 02:14:00,553
Wonderful.

2240
02:14:02,353 --> 02:14:06,193
Till when will you steal my
crime's punishment from me?

2241
02:14:07,164 --> 02:14:08,273
Enough.

2242
02:14:08,353 --> 02:14:10,353
I won't become
a stair case to heaven any longer.

2243
02:14:11,113 --> 02:14:13,673
If you want to be punished, commit
crimes and be punished.

2244
02:14:15,073 --> 02:14:16,073
Who are you?

2245
02:14:18,153 --> 02:14:19,889
You will get my introduction
in your old files.

2246
02:14:19,913 --> 02:14:21,473
Like that, my name is Sudhir Rai.

2247
02:14:21,913 --> 02:14:23,073
Doctor Sudhir Rai.

2248
02:14:23,793 --> 02:14:26,673
I am a partner in the nursing
home. I am a child specialist.

2249
02:14:27,273 --> 02:14:29,793
But the bitterness of the poverty..

2250
02:14:29,873 --> 02:14:31,873
Still exists on the
tip of my tongue.

2251
02:14:32,273 --> 02:14:36,593
Therefore, to earn money, with the
right hand and the left too..

2252
02:14:38,353 --> 02:14:42,113
I used to commit illegal abortions
without him knowing.

2253
02:14:43,233 --> 02:14:44,833
As big as the house of the girl..

2254
02:14:45,393 --> 02:14:46,753
So huge the fees.

2255
02:14:47,433 --> 02:14:49,473
The fashion of unwed mothers
hasn't started as yet.

2256
02:14:49,953 --> 02:14:51,393
The girl who died..

2257
02:14:52,633 --> 02:14:53,753
I operated on her.

2258
02:14:53,833 --> 02:14:56,113
Sudhir, what nonsense
are you talking?

2259
02:14:56,353 --> 02:14:57,793
I will not let this happen.

2260
02:14:58,433 --> 02:15:00,873
This is the case file,
with my sign.

2261
02:15:02,233 --> 02:15:05,273
And this is fifteen thousand rupees.
The cost of the death of the girl.

2262
02:15:05,353 --> 02:15:07,873
- Inspector, it's alie.
- I confess to my crime..

2263
02:15:07,953 --> 02:15:10,153
And surrender before the law,
inspector.

2264
02:15:10,753 --> 02:15:12,713
The signatures on the Death
Certificate..

2265
02:15:12,833 --> 02:15:14,313
Those he put on to save my life.

2266
02:15:15,153 --> 02:15:17,513
Are you aware of the consequences
of your confession.

2267
02:15:18,393 --> 02:15:19,473
I have come prepared.

2268
02:15:20,233 --> 02:15:21,553
Ten-fifteen years in jail.

2269
02:15:21,753 --> 02:15:23,249
And when I will be realsed from
the jail..

2270
02:15:23,273 --> 02:15:24,753
Won't be able to practice
medicine.

2271
02:15:25,033 --> 02:15:27,369
But I shall not let him ride on my
shoulder and touch heights.

2272
02:15:27,393 --> 02:15:28,433
- Sudhir I..
- Shut up!

2273
02:15:28,673 --> 02:15:30,073
And don't try to be smart.

2274
02:15:30,833 --> 02:15:34,112
I have lived long enough on your
dole for quite long.

2275
02:15:34,713 --> 02:15:37,073
Now I want to live my own life.
May it be the jail. Got it?

2276
02:15:41,593 --> 02:15:42,593
Officer, may I..

2277
02:15:43,313 --> 02:15:45,473
- Talk for two minutes privately?
- Sure.

2278
02:15:46,433 --> 02:15:47,953
But you are under arrest.

2279
02:15:48,953 --> 02:15:49,953
Thank you.

2280
02:15:55,433 --> 02:15:56,553
What drama is this?

2281
02:15:58,473 --> 02:15:59,473
Drama?

2282
02:16:00,953 --> 02:16:02,393
It's you who are making drama.

2283
02:16:03,513 --> 02:16:06,553
Since the time you have returned
you've started this drama.

2284
02:16:07,953 --> 02:16:09,913
But you did not give me any
part in this drama.

2285
02:16:11,033 --> 02:16:12,433
But you were not there then.

2286
02:16:16,273 --> 02:16:17,273
Prashant.

2287
02:16:18,513 --> 02:16:20,033
Ask for pardon from Sakhi
on my behalf.

2288
02:16:21,114 --> 02:16:24,753
Tell her whatever I did, it was
to save the reputation of the house.

2289
02:16:26,473 --> 02:16:28,409
I took that money and the car
forcibly because I didn't want..

2290
02:16:28,433 --> 02:16:30,233
That police should get
any proof.

2291
02:16:31,553 --> 02:16:33,513
That's why I also made Nandini
flee from Bombay.

2292
02:16:38,313 --> 02:16:39,313
Prashant, you..

2293
02:16:41,352 --> 02:16:43,872
Must be very tired now
chasing the money.

2294
02:16:45,913 --> 02:16:47,206
Go, go home.

2295
02:16:49,073 --> 02:16:50,073
No.

2296
02:16:51,032 --> 02:16:54,112
I want to live rest of my life with
my soul and my heart.

2297
02:16:55,433 --> 02:16:58,593
The sin which I committed,
I should be punished for it.

2298
02:17:01,793 --> 02:17:04,239
What could be the bigger
punishment from this, Prashant..

2299
02:17:05,112 --> 02:17:07,243
That you will never forget
this all your life..

2300
02:17:07,673 --> 02:17:09,946
That I am paying for your deed.

2301
02:17:12,183 --> 02:17:13,183
Go.

2302
02:17:14,437 --> 02:17:15,437
Go home.

2303
02:17:16,566 --> 02:17:19,250
This way he has repaid
his life's entire debt..

2304
02:17:20,037 --> 02:17:21,290
But..

2305
02:17:21,833 --> 02:17:23,073
What should I do now?

2306
02:17:23,913 --> 02:17:25,113
What should I do now?

2307
02:17:29,323 --> 02:17:30,665
Oh God!

2308
02:17:32,132 --> 02:17:33,671
O God!

2309
02:17:53,352 --> 02:17:54,729
Sukhi.

2310
02:18:08,073 --> 02:18:11,953
How beautiful you look in the
red bordered white saree.

2311
02:18:13,673 --> 02:18:15,233
Just like goddess.

2312
02:18:17,713 --> 02:18:19,873
You have repaid all your debts.

2313
02:18:20,352 --> 02:18:21,352
With interest..

2314
02:18:22,032 --> 02:18:25,632
But I had no debts of anybody
on me.

2315
02:18:26,753 --> 02:18:27,953
Now what should I do?

2316
02:18:28,993 --> 02:18:30,793
How can I live in that house now?

2317
02:18:34,513 --> 02:18:37,273
You consider me very close
to you, Sakhi, right?

2318
02:18:39,473 --> 02:18:40,753
You don't know Sudhir..

2319
02:18:41,513 --> 02:18:44,593
That how close I consider you,
how as my own..

2320
02:18:45,032 --> 02:18:47,432
That I myself did not know.

2321
02:18:48,593 --> 02:18:49,997
So listen to me.

2322
02:18:52,313 --> 02:18:55,313
If ever in my life I have consider
a girl as my own..

2323
02:18:56,313 --> 02:18:58,873
If I have highly
respected anyone..

2324
02:18:59,784 --> 02:19:00,993
Then it's you Sakhi.

2325
02:19:01,873 --> 02:19:03,233
But you should also know..

2326
02:19:04,753 --> 02:19:06,593
The day you will lose Prashant..

2327
02:19:08,032 --> 02:19:09,432
That day you'd lose me too.

2328
02:19:12,633 --> 02:19:14,473
Accepted that Prashant
had lost his way..

2329
02:19:15,073 --> 02:19:16,953
But wasn't it your fault too?

2330
02:19:18,593 --> 02:19:19,593
A wife..

2331
02:19:20,793 --> 02:19:23,833
Could not you have kept in
the binds of your love?

2332
02:19:25,952 --> 02:19:28,592
If this defeat is that of
Prashant than..

2333
02:19:29,513 --> 02:19:30,753
It's you defeat too.

2334
02:19:32,513 --> 02:19:33,793
Our society is such..

2335
02:19:34,233 --> 02:19:36,113
Where everything is
weight in money.

2336
02:19:38,073 --> 02:19:41,473
You take him somewhere far,
very far from here, Sakhi.

2337
02:19:42,913 --> 02:19:45,593
Where our this rotten civilization
hasn't reached yet.

2338
02:19:47,352 --> 02:19:48,633
By staying there, he..

2339
02:19:49,833 --> 02:19:51,793
He will find himself.
Realize himself.

2340
02:19:52,073 --> 02:19:54,073
He will be fine, Sakhi.

2341
02:19:57,153 --> 02:20:00,633
And when I will return after
ten years form here, then..

2342
02:20:02,713 --> 02:20:05,033
Where will I go with such a
great burden of stigma?

2343
02:20:08,513 --> 02:20:09,673
Where will I hide.

2344
02:20:12,553 --> 02:20:13,553
In this..

2345
02:20:15,633 --> 02:20:17,393
Apart form both of you
in this world..

2346
02:20:19,073 --> 02:20:20,313
Who else do I have?

2347
02:20:23,753 --> 02:20:25,553
And I wish when I come there..

2348
02:20:26,393 --> 02:20:27,993
Then I see that both of you..

2349
02:20:29,393 --> 02:20:31,193
Have really made a home
our of a home.

2350
02:20:33,673 --> 02:20:35,393
And what can house be where..

2351
02:20:36,233 --> 02:20:38,513
Where you can't hear the
laughter of some child.

2352
02:20:39,793 --> 02:20:41,353
Can't hear child's cry.

2353
02:20:44,033 --> 02:20:45,033
Mother.

2354
02:20:47,553 --> 02:20:48,553
Mother.

2355
02:20:50,273 --> 02:20:51,273
Mother.

2356
02:20:55,473 --> 02:20:56,553
Maa!

2357
02:21:07,513 --> 02:21:09,993
Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom..

2358
02:21:10,753 --> 02:21:12,233
Yes, I'm here, son.

2359
02:21:12,433 --> 02:21:15,073
Mom, dad says we'll go to town.

2360
02:21:15,313 --> 02:21:17,753
And from there we'll bring
back, uncle.

2361
02:21:17,993 --> 02:21:18,993
Yes, son.

2362
02:21:19,033 --> 02:21:21,193
Mom, you'll teach me airplane,
won't you?

2363
02:21:21,353 --> 02:21:23,513
When grow up,
I will become a pilot.

2364
02:21:24,433 --> 02:21:25,433
Look, my child.

2365
02:21:26,753 --> 02:21:28,193
When your uncle arrives..

2366
02:21:28,513 --> 02:21:31,046
You observer him
and be like him. Okay?
