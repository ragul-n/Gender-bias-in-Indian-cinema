1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,450
Perpetually it happens.

2
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:37,450
In 1947 too, it happened.
From East Bengal to West Bengal.

3
00:01:49,820 --> 00:02:00,450
Ranaghat of West Bengal,..the place
where its soil swamped by refugees' tears
and atmosphere filled by their sighs.

4
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:16,450
Those whose life only was spared
by the turmoils of partition, stayed here.

5
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:30,450
When gets haunted by the memories
of their home and native place,
they couldn't resist to go back.

6
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:48,450
But when they came back,
they understood eveything has changed.
New language, new culture, new symbols,
and new smell. Again to Ranaghat..

7
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:10,450
When the government panicked by seeing
the unending outflow of refugees, they said;

8
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:21,450
'these refugees are foreigners, deport them
as per our citizens' wish.'

9
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:28,450
But the west bengal people
didn't obey this order.

10
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:38,450
They asked; 'at the time of partition,
why didn't you inquire citizens' wish?'

11
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:50,450
These people aren't refugees.
They are the people, whose land
had been stolen because of you.

12
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,450
"The Dispossessed."

13
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:22,450
Later, a board appeared above
the temporary camp in Ranaghat
on 10th March, 1950.

14
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,450
Camp of endless burdens.

15
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:39,450
That endless burdens still persist,
even after two decades.

16
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:21,450
Yesterday a woman came here
for seeing you. Looks like bengali.

17
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:35,450
Almost everyone of 70,000 malayalees here
are living only in their secluded world.

18
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:43,450
He hides his dreams and sorrows inside,
and put a smiling face outside.

19
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:50,450
He tries to forget himself
in the wine glasses occasionally.

20
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:57,450
Just the 1% of population,
and 16th according to language.

21
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,450
Hey, Ouseppachan. Come.

22
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:13,450
He is Venu.
He is working in the project department,
that recruit refugees to Andaman.

23
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:18,450
This is Ouseppachan.
The king of Rubber merchants in Kolkata.

24
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:21,450
Oh, it not like what they exaggerate.

25
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:26,450
I came here to remember you
about our Onam celebration.

26
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:28,450
That'll be like what we said earlier.

27
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,450
Let him come too.
Sure.

28
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:37,450
But no need of our Variyar sir.
He don't even allow us to open a bottle.

29
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,450
That's right.

30
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,450
Swami, two tea.

31
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,450
Sir, are you a malayali?

32
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:17,450
Yes, by birth. Now bengali. Next..

33
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,450
How do you learn malayalam?

34
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:28,450
Sir, can you take me too to island.
I'm also a refugee.

35
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,450
Are you farmers?
Caste?

36
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,450
Not farmers.
Caste is Kayastha.

37
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:46,450
This project is intended for Namasudra.
For the farmers from scheduled caste.

38
00:12:52,820 --> 00:13:03,450
Want to escape from this damn Kolkata.
Else, my two children..

39
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,450
Have the tea.

40
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,450
Are your children literate?

41
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:40,450
Daughter studied MA. Didn't write exam.
Son..polytechnic..

42
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,450
Will look some other job vacancies in island.

43
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:53,450
In any bengali schools.

44
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,450
Save me sir.

45
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:04,450
There'll be any way.
Please go with peace.

46
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:45,450
Who's this woman?
I have seen her somewhere.
But when?, At which place?

47
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:45,450
The poverty stricken farmers,
poor small artists, circus players
who performed on road side,
the victims of brutal feudalism..

48
00:17:51,820 --> 00:18:04,450
From them, the scheduled caste farmers
is going to some unknown place
of this world to survive.

49
00:19:33,820 --> 00:20:31,450
[Reciting a malayalam poem]

50
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,450
Great work.

51
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:39,450
In these days, a malayali poet
who thought of writing
a poem named 'Bangladesh' is..

52
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,450
We don't know to respect our own people.

53
00:20:51,820 --> 00:21:02,450
We talk about all these bengali writers.
But are they willing to understand our writers?
At most, they may heard about Thakazhi.
That's all.

54
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:12,450
Not all the things you said are right.
Never forget the slogan and support given
by bengalis at the time of Kayyur revolt.

55
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:19,450
Agreed. But here, so many malayali boys
are marrying bengali girls.
But why not marrying a malayali girl..

56
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:24,450
Where's parochialism in what i said?

57
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:32,450
Leave it and move to next round.
If the black is finished,
here it is the white horse.

58
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:52,450
Sorry sir. Didn't recognize at first.

59
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:01,450
My daughter Damayanthi.

60
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:48,450
Went for strike in college. Didn't complete
post graduation. Got a teacher's job,
after i begged so much in front of many.
But what to say now..

61
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:57,450
She's a poor girl. Please forgive.

62
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:01,450
There are facts in what she said.

63
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,450
Sir, when will you return back to island?

64
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:16,450
As soon as my job is finished.
Mostly, within two months.

65
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:22,450
Can you please enquire about
the job you have said earlier?

66
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,450
Sure.

67
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:35,450
Write you address here.

68
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,450
Panikkar is my husband's name.

69
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:21,450
Did you go to Kerala?

70
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:30,450
Once. Till the front door of husband's house.
Couldn't go beyond that.

71
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:41,450
What's your husband's name?

72
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:44,450
Kunjunni Panikkar.

73
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:38,450
How is that family's disappointment
became mine too?

74
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:53,450
I think this Kunjunni Panikkar is my uncle,
who left the village years ago.

75
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:04,450
Kunjunni uncle, the man who was
my hero in the childhood. The rebel, writer..

76
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:30,450
To mother,
Here i unexpectedly met the
widow of Kunjunni uncle.
Her name is Arathi Panikkar.

77
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:38,450
It is said that Delhi is the city of tombs.
Then, Kolkata is the tomb of shattered dreams.

78
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:50,450
It'll take time for malayalees to understand
that each bengali around him, give up their
identity and self respect for survival.

79
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:55,450
Her husband, who was seen as healthy,
died of cholera last week,
while preparing to go to island.
What'll be the future of this poor widow,
like many other widows of Ranaghat?.
And, what'll be that of Kunjunni uncle's widow?

80
00:32:46,820 --> 00:33:00,450
I'm sure that they are Kunjunni uncle's
wife and daughter. But the tone of rejection
and exasperation in my mother's lines...

81
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:39,820
Where are they?

82
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:42,820
Who?

83
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:45,450
Kunjunni's wife and children.

84
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:47,450
I came without bringing anyone.

85
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:21,820
Where is he?

86
00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:29,820
It's good he hasn't bring them.

87
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:45,820
How did you find them?
How's their life?

88
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:03,820
What about the share of Kunjunni uncle here?

89
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:09,820
Kunjunni's land is with me.
I'm not going to give it to some outcasts.

90
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:15,820
Paddy field is with Bhavani.

91
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:19,820
Don't expect it from that stingy woman.

92
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:56,820
How's her life there?
And children..?

93
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,450
In a miserable condition.

94
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,450
Madhavan. People call me Madhavan master.

95
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:33,450
Kunjunni strongly worked for our organization.
He wrote letters to me when he was in Dhaka.
Where is his family?

96
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:41,450
Bhavani Aunty wants to see you.

97
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,450
Did you see Arathi?

98
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:10,450
Yes.

99
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:11,450
Sit.

100
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,450
Are they in Calcutta?

101
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:25,450
Does she look old?

102
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:27,450
Somewhat.

103
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:29,450
More than me?

104
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:36,450
Arathi is younger than me.

105
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:56,450
Kunjunni's paddy field is with me.
You should pay attention to what i'm saying.

106
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:14,450
That field is a tenure property.
They give that to me as my share
like a punishment.
But i legally overcame it,
using my intelligence.

107
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:19,450
Are you listening?

108
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:21,450
Yes.

109
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:26,820
You know what law is.
So you say, must i give that property
to Arathi?

110
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:36,450
Then i say; there is no need to hand over it.

111
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:42,450
But i'm willing to give.

112
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:59,450
I'm ready to give the paddy field.
If they want as money,
sell this land.

113
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:52,450
Come here before you return.

114
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:54,820
Sure.

115
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:57,820
Give this to Ananthan,
but don't get noticed by Kunjunni.

116
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:14,820
Give this to Kunjunni,
but don't get noticed by Ananthan.

117
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:08,820
For how long we have to live like this?

118
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:19,820
Let all these busy travellings get finished.

119
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:26,820
Even if everything get finished,
do you think your family will agree with it?

120
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:30,820
I'll never be like Kunjunni uncle.

121
00:43:35,450 --> 00:43:38,820
Please..
somebody will see.

122
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:10,450
I heard that you visited that slut.

123
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:17,450
She might slam in your face.

124
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:22,450
Bhavani Aunty agreed to hand over the field.

125
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:40,450
Oh..so she, herself is giving the property
to Kunjunni's family!
She is the one who is responsible for
him to leave this place.

126
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:15,450
Please leave me Kunjunni.
Somebody will see.

127
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:43,450
That innocent Ananthan, earned money
and worked hard in foreign countries.
But when he returned, he had to commit
suicide because of that slut's perfidies.

128
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:49,450
I'm returning today itself.

129
00:45:50,450 --> 00:45:55,450
Then why you came here?
To get the share of some vagrants. Is it?

130
00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:05,450
You always find these types of people.
I'm aware of everything you do.

131
00:46:12,450 --> 00:46:16,450
You have money for all these matters,
but for taking me to Vellore..

132
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:29,450
You have money to treat not only in Vellore,
even in America.
Income from all these properites,
then the money your relatives are sending..

133
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:56,450
Shall i come with you to Calcutta.
May find any job there with malayalis..

134
00:46:57,820 --> 00:47:05,450
The malayalis there are doing jobs like
rubber business, tailoring,..
What job will be appropriate
for a brahmin like you?

135
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:10,450
Even cooking is ok for me.
At least, the starvation of my family
can be reduced.

136
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:39,450
Did you see them?
How's his daughter looks like?
Is she fair skinned, like Kunjunni?
Does she has long beautiful hair,
like Kunjunni?

137
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:21,450
This is your mother.
Can you recognize?

138
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:51,450
I'm taking this,
for showing it to Arathi Aunty.

139
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:57,450
But you have to give it back.
You didn't return any of the things,
you took from me.

140
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:04,450
I'll give back everything you gave,
with some new good books.
There are so many good book stalls in Kolkata.

141
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:12,450
This is for Arathi's daughter?
Her name is Damayanthi, right?

142
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:30,450
May i leave. Will write when i reach.

143
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:58,450
Tell Arathi that, i'll accept
all the decisions she makes.

144
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:30,450
I'm going. Don't reveal the death news.

145
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:55,450
Your Ananthan uncle commited suicide,
in a lodge in Madhura.
That's why police has came. Don't tell
anybody about this.

146
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:34,450
Hey..what's this?
Please come.

147
00:57:47,820 --> 00:57:58,450
Daughter's parole is going to expire.
She went to submit a plea to magistrate.
If it doesn't get..

148
00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:13,450
Don't you understand who i am?

149
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:22,450
What you are saying?
I know you are the refugee officer.

150
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:32,450
I'm Kunjunni Panikkar's sister's son.

151
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:03,450
Sit.

152
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:13,450
Which sister's..?

153
00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:25,450
Does Devaki has only one son?

154
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:31,450
Yes. I'm Venu.

155
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:40,450
I've visited home, recently.

156
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:52,450
Who kept this?

157
00:59:53,820 --> 00:59:55,450
Bhavani Aunty.

158
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:11,450
Hope, Bhavani is fine.

159
01:00:12,450 --> 01:00:13,450
Yes.

160
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:21,450
Bhavani's beautiness..

161
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:24,450
Have you seen Bhavani Aunty?

162
01:00:27,820 --> 01:00:42,450
No. But heard about her many times.
Why you suddenly went to home town?

163
01:00:46,820 --> 01:00:49,450
The share of properties you deserve..

164
01:00:54,820 --> 01:01:06,450
The memory of the visit
made by me and your uncle, to there
isn't faded.

165
01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:43,450
Gate wasn't opened.
A group of aged people yelled from yard.
Women and kids behind the windows looked at us.
We came back.

166
01:01:48,820 --> 01:02:00,450
In train, both of us cried uncontrollably.

167
01:02:07,820 --> 01:02:12,450
India's partition was during that period.

168
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:25,450
How Kunjunni uncle died?

169
01:02:35,820 --> 01:02:53,450
He died of cholera,
in a refugee camp.
Damayanthi was only two months old.
And i was pregnant.

170
01:02:55,820 --> 01:03:30,450
To send a telegram to your family,
i got money by begging in refugee camp.
My brother was in a higher position,
when i and my children roamed the streets
of Kolkata with hunger.

171
01:03:32,820 --> 01:03:37,450
But i didn't seek help from anyone.

172
01:04:04,820 --> 01:04:10,450
Bhavani Aunty is willing to give the property.

173
01:04:11,820 --> 01:04:14,450
I don't need anything from anyone.

174
01:04:26,820 --> 01:04:27,450
I'm leaving, Aunty.

175
01:04:29,820 --> 01:04:40,450
I rejected only the wealth you offered,
not the relationship with you.
I need it always.

176
01:04:43,820 --> 01:04:46,450
I came in the middle of many busy jobs.

177
01:04:47,450 --> 01:04:49,450
I prepare food for you.

178
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:32,450
Aunty, where is the son?

179
01:07:40,820 --> 01:07:50,450
He is hiding somewhere.
She knows, but wouldn't disclose
the location even to me.

180
01:13:51,820 --> 01:14:00,450
Your mother mayn't be able to
go for tuition job in future.
You should try for a job.

181
01:14:12,820 --> 01:14:15,450
The advice from loved ones
will always be reactionary.

182
01:14:20,820 --> 01:14:22,450
This is a universal truth.

183
01:15:37,820 --> 01:15:44,450
Siren of ship..
The time to go to island has arrived.

184
01:23:32,820 --> 01:23:34,450
This necklace suits you well.

185
01:23:47,820 --> 01:23:50,450
Does my 'Murappennu' feel romantic?

186
01:24:16,820 --> 01:24:19,450
I'm not your 'Murappennu', brother.

187
01:29:19,820 --> 01:29:26,450
Low-tide in Ganges,..
The speed of ship is increasing.

188
01:29:30,820 --> 01:29:35,450
The aeon of hope of 'the dispossessed'
has begun.

189
01:29:54,820 --> 01:30:06,450
The journey to the shores of
the promised land somewhere in
eastern islands, has started.

190
01:31:39,820 --> 01:31:50,450
In 1971 April, the refugee flow
from east bengal
resulted in the war between
India and Pakistan in that December.

191
01:31:52,820 --> 01:32:02,450
It is the beginning of an another fleeing
of millions, through the bloodstained
path of history.

192
01:33:06,820 --> 01:33:07,450
'The dispossessed'
