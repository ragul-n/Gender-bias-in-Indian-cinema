00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:23,054
Balakrishna (Barber)

5
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:24,959
Are you giving a complaint?

6
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:54,488
Respected sir!

7
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:58,160
I am Balu who runs a saloon
at Sirisilla village.

8
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:03,329
Sir! I want to modify my saloon
and I need your help.

9
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:05,836
I know that you will laugh at me.

10
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,604
I am Balu, owner of the barber shop
that's beside the main road in Sirisilla.

11
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:11,075
I inherited an old chair and
some instruments from my dad...

12
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:13,335
...who did business at Jeedigunta.

13
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:16,012
I use them in my shop as sentiment.

14
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:17,441
Those have become very old.

15
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:20,676
In modern times, I
wish to use a rolling chair...

16
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:22,179
...and a large mirror in my shop.

17
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:25,621
I wish to apply for
a loan of rupees 50,000.

18
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:27,688
Sir! An important matter!

19
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:30,860
I hate giving bribe
and those who take bribe.

20
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:34,695
Hence, I could not get
a loan anywhere.

21
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:39,135
If you sanction me the loan
without asking for bribe...

22
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:40,971
...you are a honest person.

23
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:42,206
I will repay the principle...

24
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:48,103
...with low interest in three years.

25
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:52,075
Awaiting your valuable reply,
yours sincerely, Balakrishna.

26
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:55,717
I've read Harichandran's history,
but I've not seen Harichandran!

27
00:05:56,622 --> 00:06:01,685
I have read 'Test of Truth' 6 times
but have not seen Gandhiji.

28
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,193
You have rectified my fault now.

29
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:05,895
How arrogant you are.

30
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:10,430
Did you write about bribe in the
letter addressed to a government officer?

31
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:11,994
Did I ask for a bribe?

32
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:13,938
Did anybody tell you
that I ask for a bribe?

33
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:17,932
If this letter is read by my superiors
and lose my job...

34
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:20,307
Will you give me a job
in your barber shop?

35
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:24,277
Pardon me sir!
All government officers accept bribe!

36
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:26,817
There are a few who are honest.

37
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:30,413
If you are one of them,
you can strike off the word bribe...

38
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:31,947
...and sanction me the loan sir.

39
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,990
You will run around for
a revolving chair all your life.

40
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:38,992
Someone please throw this guy out?

41
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,061
My God! The only pot
that was left, has broken.

42
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,364
How am I going to cook?

43
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:50,569
Why worry when there
is nothing to cook?

44
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:53,610
Sri Devi! What was the noise there?

45
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:57,381
That's nothing. It was the goat bleating!

46
00:06:57,617 --> 00:07:00,950
Does the sound of goat bleat sounds
as if the pot has broken?

47
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:02,851
At times!

48
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:05,488
Where is Salim Bhai?
Has he gone to work?

49
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:08,918
He went out now after
eating mutton chops and parotta.

50
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:12,364
He will come back for lunch
to have chicken rice.

51
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:15,057
What about Noor Jehan's marriage?

52
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,792
The groom is demanding a Maruti car.

53
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:18,664
Her dad says he will give
only a motor bike.

54
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:23,501
If he saves the money spent on
biriyani, he could buy a bigger car.

55
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:27,374
I like you and your husband
for your honest talk.

56
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:28,343
Can you give me a pot then?

57
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:31,640
So it was the noise of
a pot breaking, wasn't it?

58
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:34,643
So, you broke another pot, right?

59
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:37,985
Have you vowed
to break 100 pots in a month?

60
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:40,390
Will anyone do that deliberately?

61
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,786
It is because of your carelessness.

62
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:43,489
You don't seem
to concentrate on your work.

63
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:47,693
You over cook the rice
while going after the hen.

64
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,427
Both the works get spoiled

65
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:50,966
It is your usual work.

66
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:53,833
You are right!
There is rice on the oven!

67
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:56,742
Don't know whether rice is spoilt or not?

68
00:07:57,777 --> 00:07:59,972
She seems to be the right one for me.

69
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:07,751
I kept the tamarind somewhere here.

70
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:11,488
Where could I have kept it?

71
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:15,558
Have you seen the tamarind?

72
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:19,364
I have eaten it up.

73
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,693
All make fun
saying I have a tamarind look.

74
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,967
I've forgotten to ask you...

75
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:31,033
You told me that you'll
bring fish from the Market...

76
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:32,244
...Have you brought it?

77
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,840
I went to the market but
not a single fish was available.

78
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:37,372
All the fish is sold away because
Chikenguniya is spread in the town.

79
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:39,881
Ok. Why didn't you get
chicken instead?

80
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:43,011
How can I get chicken
which died because of Chikenguniya?

81
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:46,290
Children will come hungry from school...

82
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:47,756
...What will I serve them?

83
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,063
There is a hen in our house.
Why don't you kill it?

84
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:54,597
Oh gosh! It is fed by us.

85
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,496
Yes. All hens are fed by someone.

86
00:08:58,304 --> 00:08:59,328
Which one do you give importance to?
Children or hen.

87
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:01,095
I'll give importance to both

88
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,334
Won't you give importance to me?

89
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:06,342
- What? - I went out
early this morning.

90
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:08,311
Did you enquire about my loan?

91
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:09,638
But you are concerned about other things.

92
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:11,777
- I know that you won't get it.
- How?

93
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:16,149
Didn't I tell you not to talk
about the bribe in the letter?

94
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:17,322
But you didn't listen to me.

95
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:21,085
Do I want to know that you were sent out?

96
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:24,223
Ok. You are smarter than me.

97
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,092
How innocent you are.

98
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:31,602
Shoba went to school weeping
in the morning

99
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:34,337
- Why? - Today is the last day
to pay her fees.

100
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:38,238
If you don't pay her fees today, tomorrow
she will be sent out from the school.

101
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:40,378
Somehow I want to buy
a rolling chair and a Scissor.

102
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:43,277
I will go and look for a nice teak tree
in Dharmaraju's grove.

103
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:45,776
- He asks for more interest, doesn't he?
- First let me go and look at it.

104
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:47,050
When money comes in,
we'll buy.

105
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:51,384
Look! You don't worry
about Shoba's school fees.

106
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:53,557
It's my duty to pay her school fees.

107
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:01,222
Dharmaraju has bought groves
like this by getting...

108
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:03,066
...enormous interest from others.

109
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,760
When money comes in,
I should buy a tree like this...

110
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:09,401
...and make a revolving chair!

111
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:17,943
Who is the intruder
who touches my tree?

112
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:20,909
He is our Barber Balu.

113
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:24,512
How dare you enter
our boss Karmaraju's grove?

114
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:29,987
- I am Dharmaraju not Karmaraju!
- Ok, you are Dharmaraju.

115
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:33,225
Are you looking out for
a place here to cut hair...

116
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:36,267
...as there are no customers at your shop?

117
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:41,666
You should have found
a place at the junction or a center.

118
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,100
I am trying to find some suitable wood
to make a revolving chair.

119
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:48,969
Do you want to take this from my grove
without my knowledge?

120
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:50,681
I don't know those things.

121
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,751
I have told you that
I will make you a revolving chair...

122
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:58,081
...with better wood and
buy all things required for your shop.

123
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:00,484
You refused to get loan from me
as I am charging huge interest.

124
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:01,657
What shall I do then?

125
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:04,791
You are charging enormous interest
instead of normal bank rates!

126
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:07,499
I am getting huge interest
from others alright.

127
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:10,258
But I don't want to buy
groves like this even.

128
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:14,596
I want to produce a film and want to put
our town name before my name...

129
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:18,034
...in the titles to make it
popular all over the state.

130
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,702
Your name should be written
as producer Sirisilla Karmaraju.

131
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,145
No, it is not Karmaraju...
but as Sirisilla Dharmaraju.

132
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:25,384
You have grown tall
but you don't have brain.

133
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,042
Shall we print your colour
photo in the banner?

134
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:33,748
Ok. That's why I have a director
and a music director with me.

135
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:36,292
Where are they?

136
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:39,095
They have a long life.
Here they are!

137
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:41,429
Why have they brought
women with them?

138
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:43,596
- They have brought two women.
- I don't like it.

139
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,170
What is all this?

140
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:47,497
- I am not like that producer.
- Sir! Don't mistake me.

141
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,467
- You asked for a nice story
- Yes.

142
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:52,403
We want to find out how much response
Will we get from the women for our story...

143
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:55,036
...and how much support they will give
for the sentiment scenes.

144
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:56,478
That's the reason I have them with us.

145
00:11:56,782 --> 00:11:58,511
Seeing their action, we want
to know what is your reaction?

146
00:11:58,617 --> 00:12:02,781
They need not hug me for that.
But your story should touch my heart.

147
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:05,286
You said that correct, sir.
- Ok, Open up the story.

148
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:06,789
It is a village to start with.

149
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:12,927
<i>Oh sister! I am always</i>
<i>with you as your protector.</i>

150
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:15,427
- What is this?
- This is the title song, boss.

151
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,900
The story hasn't yet started.
He is yelling.

152
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:20,597
Why do they cry in the beginning?

153
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:22,071
They have tender heart
as they are women.

154
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:23,106
Do as I say.

155
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:27,137
There is a hospital in the village.
And there is only one bed.

156
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:29,804
A pregnant lady comes
running to the village hospital.

157
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:31,271
She does not get a bed.

158
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:32,811
She sits on the mat.

159
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:38,119
Seeing their mother's agony
the children start to cry.

160
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,658
It starts to rain outside.

161
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:42,160
There is a cry from inside.

162
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:45,962
Stop it. You are crying
but they are not crying.

163
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:48,395
So, your story hasn't
touched the women, right?

164
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:49,962
Why didn't you cry?

165
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:51,536
You told us to start
crying only when told.

166
00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:52,804
You didn't tell us to cry!

167
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:54,662
What did he tell you
before bringing you here?

168
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:58,106
He told us that he will
give us 100 rupees each.

169
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:06,878
There is no advance for them.
I'll give 50 rupees to you.

170
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:13,391
Say truly! Did his story
touch your hearts?

171
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:14,857
It didn't touch our sandals.

172
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:17,724
The woman in the story
is already a mother of two.

173
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:20,728
What if she delivers the baby
on the bed or on the mat?

174
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:22,794
Is he telling a story?

175
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,934
If you produce a film with his story
you will go bankrupt.

176
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:29,366
The people who watch
Movies are very intelligent.

177
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:40,711
You can't cheat them
with these type of stories.

178
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:45,154
If you want to become
popular in the world...

179
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:47,086
You have to produce a film
with the super star.

180
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,188
Your fate will change
if he signs the paper.

181
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:52,193
- Where can we find him?
- He will be in Jambara Hills.

182
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:55,132
It is not Jambara Hills.
It is Banjara Hills.

183
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,598
Oops! What he said is right.
He can't spell it correctly.

184
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:26,723
The king has come.

185
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:30,567
I am just opening the shop.
How come you are in before me?

186
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:32,125
The window pane has no hook!

187
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:34,630
It will open if pushed,
and it will close when pressed.

188
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,835
What are you doing here
when I am doing my business?

189
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:38,738
We are just playing cards.
What is there to take away from here?

190
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:40,568
You have only the old comb
and rusty scissors.

191
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:42,076
That's all is here.

192
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:44,411
Look at Kantha Rao's shop!
It is very crowded.

193
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:45,809
What is in this shop?

194
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:49,409
Then, go to his shop.
Go away.

195
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:53,482
Kantha Rao's shop is
the biggest in this market.

196
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:56,120
When will you learn his trade tricks?

197
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:59,489
He gets his men with
the help of impostors.

198
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:03,793
Sir! Why do you hold me?
Tell me.

199
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:07,499
Leave me sir.
I didn't do any wrong.

200
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:10,571
Get down and go inside.

201
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:11,833
Sir! Why are you
taking me with you?

202
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:12,942
- Leave us.
- Go inside.

203
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:14,636
I thought you are taking us
to the police station.

204
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:16,073
Instead you brought us
to the barber shop.

205
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:21,112
- Have you applied spray to all?
- Yes boss.

206
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:34,897
Half tonsure is for 6 rupees and
full tonsure is for 50 rupees.

207
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:38,993
All evil eyes should fall on you.

208
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:40,802
Take this.

209
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,235
Get up my dear!

210
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:47,339
Oh God! You have tonsured...

211
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,270
...I had vowed to Thirupathi deity.

212
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:50,674
Hey boy! Give him a laddu (sweets)

213
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:54,114
Every week 100 laddus come by courier
to our shop from Thirupathi.

214
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,580
- Have it. - The laddu looks
very small in size.

215
00:15:57,189 --> 00:15:59,680
The laddu came 1 week ago.
The ghee in it has melted away.

216
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:01,918
Take it home,
apply ghee and have it.

217
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:04,620
He had vowed to visit
Lord Sathya Narayana temple.

218
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:05,890
He is crying seeing his tonsure.

219
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:08,225
Give him the
Panchamritham(Offering) then!

220
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:09,298
He'll celebrate it.

221
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:13,371
What is it? You give me
palm date instead of the offering.

222
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,274
It came 1 week ago.
It would have dried.

223
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:17,703
Put it into your mouth and chew it.
You can chew it so long.

224
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:18,877
You can go.

225
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:23,007
Hey! Take them in the auto and
Leave them from where you took them.

226
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:24,840
Bring the next batch immediately.

227
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:28,420
Is this a job to bring men
forcibly and give them a haircut?

228
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:30,112
If you drink water,
You will for sure pee

229
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,419
Like that if anyone grows hair,
they should cut it.

230
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:34,916
If anyone looks dirty to me,
lt'll make me allergic.

231
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:37,729
Go inside.

232
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:41,366
With this hand I have
Styled hair for Hollywood artists.

233
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:43,029
Hollywood artists?

234
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:45,770
Harisson ford, his father Benz...

235
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:49,038
...and his grand father
Ambassador are my customers.

236
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:54,011
Can you imagine
how you worked at me?

237
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:04,255
I've told many times not to sweep
the floor before I finish cutting.

238
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:07,092
- Why do you stare at me?
- I joined you 3 months ago.

239
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:10,259
Until now you haven't given me a chance
to cut or to shave the people.

240
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:15,562
If you pass my test,
I'll arrange someone for you.

241
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,062
- It's difficult for me.
- What difficulty?

242
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:18,735
I have applied soap to that balloon!

243
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:20,529
Try to shave it without breaking it.

244
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:28,070
He is afraid that
I will become his competitor.

245
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:29,705
So he wants me to shave
the balloon every day.

246
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:31,476
I will shave it superbly today!

247
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:44,452
If it burst this time,
I won't do this again.

248
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:52,665
Look! How the balloon burst
when you touch with the knife.

249
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:54,534
What will happen
If you do this to the face?

250
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:56,804
You have burst 1350 balloons so far.

251
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:00,374
When you successfully shave
the balloon without bursting it...

252
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:03,008
...only then I'll give you
scissors and a customer.

253
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:05,244
The gate is closed.
Open our shop.

254
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:15,319
- Hold it
- Give me.

255
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:18,155
I am a specialist in all these cuttings!

256
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:21,797
You have brought
your business to this level!

257
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:22,834
This is called mobile cutting!

258
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:24,002
- Mobile cutting?
- Yes sir.

259
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:25,966
We too run as fast as time.

260
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:27,432
You need not come to us for cutting!

261
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:28,704
We will come to you instead.

262
00:18:29,074 --> 00:18:31,008
Why do you waste time
in the traffic and at the railway gate?

263
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:34,436
You take care of my payment and
I'll take care of your getup.

264
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,645
Your idea is okay.
How will you do here?

265
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:39,807
You show your head out
and I'll do my job.

266
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:42,548
Have you seen this?
Now you have turned as Hrithik Roshan.

267
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:45,721
Give me my money.

268
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:49,852
Uncle! If you grow
your moustache like this...

269
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:51,696
...the cattle will graze on
your moustache too.

270
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,727
My moustache is useful
to me in the committee.

271
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:56,090
- Leave the moustache.
Shave the beard alone. - Ok.

272
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,030
Look! Now you look handsome
Give me 10 rupees.

273
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:04,876
Take it.

274
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:10,882
He'll be finished.

275
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,482
- Cutting!
- I don't need.

276
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:15,212
Your white hair is glittering me?

277
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:16,284
Are you using washing soap on your hair?

278
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:18,755
Now you look like the old character
'Kamalahasan' of Indian movie.

279
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:21,852
If you apply this dye,
You will turn as young as 'Kamalahasan'.

280
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:23,788
My work is over.
You can open the gate now.

281
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,559
- Thanks brother.
- Why do you open the gate?

282
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:29,598
- Tell him. - We have closed it,
and we alone have to open it.

283
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:33,062
- Won't there be any rail traffic
this way? - That was years ago.

284
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:36,207
- Go.
- You idiot!

285
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:39,201
I have learned the trick of the trade
and have shone in this field.

286
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:41,369
He seems to be thinking about me.

287
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:43,811
You grew in your business
only with your smart talk!

288
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:47,676
Yes! I grew with my smart talk.
You got ruined with your talk.

289
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:48,911
That's your bad luck.

290
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:54,625
Buy two pumpkins and
break it before our shop.

291
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,384
The evil eyes seem to fall on our shop!

292
00:19:56,795 --> 00:19:58,695
My way is right way.
Go away.

293
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,799
I am father of Kamala,
who is studying in 10 B.

294
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:07,028
10 B is at that end.

295
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:09,300
I want to see the principal.

296
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:12,402
The fees has to be remitted
in the office room, not here.

297
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:15,306
If I had the money, I would have
paid it in the office room.

298
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:18,642
- I came to you as I have no money.
- Is that so?

299
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:22,412
I have kept up my word.
I have sent your daughter out.

300
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,954
How can I remit the fees
if you send her out?

301
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:26,488
She could have been kept
outside the class room...

302
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:28,953
...she might study from there
until I remit the fees!

303
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:30,094
Are you playing with me?

304
00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:31,662
Lmagine she as a bird
attending the class from outside.

305
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:33,287
Do you think you are
talking with good sense?

306
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:36,224
Remit the fees if you can,
and send her to school.

307
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:38,865
Or else she won't be able
to write her examination!

308
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,335
I was ready to sell my goat
and remit the fees.

309
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,902
But the goat wouldn't agree for that.

310
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:46,033
Send your daughter
to the goat, to study!

311
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:48,908
Let's do one thing.
I will bring the goat here.

312
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:50,605
Will you tell her
how to teach lessons?

313
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:53,113
Are you playing with me?
Get out of here.

314
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,047
Why are you getting annoyed, being a nun?

315
00:20:57,889 --> 00:20:59,015
Jesus will be worried!

316
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:03,086
Do you know why he is
in your chain on your chest?

317
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:04,990
It is to make you kind hearted!

318
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:13,494
Wait dad! Have you remitted the fees?

319
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:15,002
I couldn't, my dear!

320
00:21:15,907 --> 00:21:17,397
How can I write my exam?

321
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:21,305
You will certainly write the exam.

322
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:24,007
I will arrange that.
Be brave.

323
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:50,375
Why is this crowd?

324
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:54,706
<i>Do exercise well.</i>

325
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:57,609
<i>Yoga is good for health.</i>

326
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,416
<i>...Don't be lazy and</i>
keep your body slim.

327
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:03,217
<i>Do exercise well.</i>

328
00:22:03,955 --> 00:22:09,257
<i>Yoga is good for health.</i>

329
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:15,759
Are you watching the girl
next door, doing exercise

330
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:20,329
...with a song on your lips
thro' the window?

331
00:22:20,872 --> 00:22:24,137
The people like you take the girls photos
and put them on internet...

332
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:27,139
...to get money
they will blackmail her.

333
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:30,640
- Do you know who she is?
- Who is she?

334
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:33,717
- She is my wife sir.
- Is it? - Yes sir.

335
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:36,845
- Why do you lie again?
- Why do you hit me without listening?

336
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:39,387
- Look at our marriage photo!
- Where is it?

337
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:43,752
- She is the P. T teacher.
- Yes, she is your wife.

338
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:46,792
Are you watching your wife
from outside the house?

339
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:48,832
I was fed up, seeing her from near!

340
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:51,297
I thought I would get a different
feeling by seeing her from distance.

341
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:53,494
- What are you telling?
- You do not believe me.

342
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:55,001
- See her for yourself.
- Leave me.

343
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,973
Why do you feel shy when
I give you permission?

344
00:22:57,642 --> 00:22:59,701
- Look her in this angle.
- I saw that!

345
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:02,706
- Now you look thro' this angle.
- I saw her.

346
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:05,583
- See in this angle.
- I saw.

347
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:08,208
- See her in close up.
- I saw her.

348
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:10,447
You are very lucky.

349
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:13,146
Didn't I say that
my judgment is always correct?

350
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,293
Why have you come back?

351
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:19,120
What judgment?

352
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:22,492
I had to clear CI sir's
doubt in his department.

353
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:25,028
Are you the IG for that?

354
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:27,362
Come in. I will clear all your doubts!

355
00:23:27,672 --> 00:23:28,969
- A moment dear.
You! - What?

356
00:23:29,374 --> 00:23:33,367
If you had taken me with you then,
you would have got your promotion!

357
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:35,640
Now she caught me before you do.

358
00:23:36,481 --> 00:23:37,277
Ask him to go.

359
00:23:38,283 --> 00:23:41,184
If any outsider enters into our
personal matter, they'll be fooled.

360
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:45,648
Why do you watch me through the window
being my husband? I will...

361
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:46,824
Leave that. It was
your husband who saw you.

362
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:48,322
Not the entire place.

363
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:51,124
- Where is the collection?
- Ask like that.

364
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:52,521
- Take this.
- How much is it?

365
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,728
- It is 500 rupees!
- 500 rupees? - Yes.

366
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:57,801
I agreed to marry you as you
promised to earn 1000 rupees a day!

367
00:23:58,703 --> 00:24:00,864
I am having a terrible time shaving
the heads of the people here...

368
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,870
...to earn this 500 rupees.

369
00:24:02,974 --> 00:24:04,669
I can't earn any more
as there is no hair left on their heads!

370
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:08,177
If you still insist, I'll have
to shave the people from the town nearby!

371
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:09,710
Then do one thing.

372
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,508
Give me 1000 rupees daily,
I'll tonsure you...

373
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:13,777
Then I'll give it to you.

374
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:15,511
I don't know what will you do?

375
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,612
I will allow you in only
if you earn 1000 rupees a day.

376
00:24:22,894 --> 00:24:25,192
Shoba! Who do you want
to become after your studies?

377
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:28,061
If you can remit the fees regularly
that is more than sufficient.

378
00:24:32,103 --> 00:24:34,503
Forget the fees!
You can study through correspondence

379
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:36,402
You could have stopped
my studies in the 9th itself

380
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:37,906
Why did you admit me in 10th?

381
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:40,337
Wait dad. We are also coming!

382
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,871
- Are your classes over?
- Yes.

383
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:47,314
- When are you going to stop our studies?
- Why do you stare at us?

384
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:48,783
You were not able to remit
our sister's fees!

385
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:51,621
You won't be able to remit our fees next.

386
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:54,220
Are you happy if I stop your studies?

387
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:58,720
Mom need not do ironing and polishing of
our shoes if we stop going to school.

388
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:00,627
You won't bother us
by telling us to study.

389
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:03,997
I made a mistake when I prayed to God
to make you more knowledgeable.

390
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:07,831
We will become dull if we eat more.
Buy us a variety of food.

391
00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:10,498
What have you bought for us today?
Fish or Chicken?

392
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,140
I got a large whale today.

393
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:17,372
You manage to keep smiling
by hiding away your agony.

394
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,245
- How do you do that?
- That is...

395
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:20,710
I have a wife who doesn't bother me
to buy things for her.

396
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:26,217
Have children who don't pester me
to give them a luxury life.

397
00:25:26,324 --> 00:25:28,224
What stops me from being happy then?

398
00:25:52,684 --> 00:26:02,059
<i>Oh flying bird! Will you come</i>
<i>here for us once?</i>

399
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:07,358
<i>Can you fly against a cyclone</i>
<i>and reach destination?</i>

400
00:26:07,465 --> 00:26:12,402
<i>Will you roam for food everyday?</i>

401
00:26:12,537 --> 00:26:20,034
<i>Will you counsel us that</i>
<i>unless we toil we won't get food?</i>

402
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:37,518
<i>Oh flying bird! Will you come</i>
<i>here for us once?</i>

403
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:09,017
<i>Cuckoos don't seek money to sing!</i>

404
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:14,188
<i>Rains doesn't beg for money to pour!</i>

405
00:27:14,332 --> 00:27:19,292
<i>Flowers don't ask</i>
<i>money for its fragrance!</i>

406
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:24,603
<i>Wind doesn't seek money to blow!</i>

407
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:29,872
<i>We won't dream beyond our limits.</i>

408
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:34,748
<i>We won't aspire for a luxurious life.</i>

409
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:39,790
<i>Daily, we try to live an ordinary life.</i>

410
00:27:39,924 --> 00:27:44,623
<i>My work feeds our family.</i>

411
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:49,632
<i>We like our work...</i>
<i>We don't like to part...</i>

412
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:57,105
<i>We live our life happily</i>
<i>without sufferings.</i>

413
00:28:05,817 --> 00:28:15,124
<i>Oh flying bird! Will you come</i>
<i>here for us once?</i>

414
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:44,417
I won't give it to you.
It's mine.

415
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:59,597
<i>Neither lottery nor share market</i>
<i>would come near us.</i>

416
00:28:59,704 --> 00:29:04,869
<i>We go for neither loan nor credit.</i>

417
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:10,241
<i>We live like Moon which</i>
<i>shines under the brightness.</i>

418
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:15,114
<i>We have guts to dare</i>
<i>anything in this world</i>

419
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:20,055
<i>No BP or diabetes.</i>

420
00:29:20,191 --> 00:29:24,890
<i>No tax paying headaches.</i>

421
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:27,361
<i>This home is heaven to us.</i>

422
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:29,933
<i>Happiness gives joy to us.</i>

423
00:29:30,068 --> 00:29:34,198
<i>Oh bird! Though we've daylight</i>
<i>in our lives...</i>

424
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:37,866
<i>... don't know when will brightness come</i>

425
00:29:46,084 --> 00:29:55,789
<i>Oh flying bird! Will you come</i>
<i>here for us once?</i>

426
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:36,229
Oh gosh! Someone's ear
is fallen down here.

427
00:30:36,534 --> 00:30:39,435
He has a name
'Cutting Kantharao' for his shop.

428
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:42,973
But he forcibly brings people and
have their heads shaved.

429
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:46,301
His name should be 'Tonsure Kantha Rao'
instead of his real name.

430
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:48,273
If we continue our work with him...

431
00:30:48,546 --> 00:30:51,276
...we are the ones
who have to undergo the consequences.

432
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:54,948
Yes buddy. He got this position
because we are working here.

433
00:30:55,286 --> 00:31:00,690
Otherwise he will have
begged on the streets.

434
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:06,194
You give respect to me when I am here.

435
00:31:07,298 --> 00:31:08,890
When I am not here, you disgrace me...

436
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:14,167
...calling me a mad guy,
good for nothing etc.,

437
00:31:14,739 --> 00:31:17,401
You can abuse me at my face
if you have guts.

438
00:31:17,842 --> 00:31:20,333
If you abuse me when I am not here...

439
00:31:22,146 --> 00:31:24,376
Should we talk in front of you?

440
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:26,316
Should we abuse you face to face?

441
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:28,749
I won't talk.
I'll scold you.

442
00:31:28,953 --> 00:31:30,011
I'll hit you.

443
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:32,685
Are you boss of us?

444
00:31:33,157 --> 00:31:35,819
Have you ever seen
your face in this mirror?

445
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:38,058
- Wait. Let me give a chance...
- Ok.

446
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:41,059
Do you know special cutting?

447
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:45,563
Have you ever cut hair properly?

448
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:49,567
You bring people making them
unconscious and tonsure them.

449
00:31:51,175 --> 00:31:53,973
Besides, there is a board outside
like this is a hotel.

450
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:58,414
You idiot! I'll kill you.

451
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:01,578
I for long wanted to
Ask you something.

452
00:32:01,886 --> 00:32:05,652
Have you ever given us
atleast 5 rupees to have Tiffin?

453
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:09,392
You fool! We get 1 rupee for tonsure.

454
00:32:10,161 --> 00:32:11,185
Why did you make him gain conscious?

455
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:13,790
Why didn't I talk for some time?

456
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:15,759
What happened to me?
I don't get anything.

457
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,800
You were talking well and suddenly
stopped your talk and...

458
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:22,940
You sprayed this on my face and...

459
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:24,167
I'll show you who I am.

460
00:32:24,642 --> 00:32:28,043
Within two minutes,
when I close my eyes and open it...

461
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:30,543
No, I won't close my eyes.

462
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,507
I'll open my eyes.

463
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:35,408
If I see you after 2 minutes...

464
00:32:40,591 --> 00:32:41,489
At reduced rates!

465
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,253
Boss! Come out once and have a look.

466
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:44,985
What happened?
Is his shop demolished?

467
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:46,426
If you see it,
You'll feel jealous.

468
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:47,791
Is that so?

469
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:49,931
At reduced rates! Hair cutting rate
at Rs.18, Shaving at Rs.7

470
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:57,474
What is it? I thought that he'll hang
himself instead of his rates board.

471
00:32:57,575 --> 00:33:00,442
He reduced his hair cutting charges
from Rs.25 to Rs.18.

472
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:02,907
And shaving reduced
from Rs.15 to Rs.7

473
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:03,948
No use!

474
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:05,913
In our shop, cutting is Rs.30
and shaving is Rs.20.

475
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:07,177
What if customers stop
coming to this shop.

476
00:33:08,353 --> 00:33:11,789
If anyone has his hair cut with the
rusted scissor in his shop...

477
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:13,351
He'll die.

478
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:14,725
Do you know one thing?

479
00:33:15,226 --> 00:33:16,318
Does he know Step cutting?

480
00:33:16,961 --> 00:33:18,155
Does he know Mushroom cutting?

481
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:19,396
Does he know Cauliflower cutting?

482
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:21,054
Boss! What is Cauliflower cutting?

483
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:23,129
That's for ladies.
You won't know it.

484
00:33:23,234 --> 00:33:24,963
I'll learn Lady-finger cutting tomorrow.

485
00:33:25,136 --> 00:33:26,603
He'll feel jealous.

486
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,139
Balu! Cut my hair.

487
00:33:39,283 --> 00:33:42,616
Boss is coming! Move away.

488
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:45,155
Move aside your cycle.

489
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:46,557
Apply the breaks slowly.

490
00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:52,387
Vegetable shop - Rs.500

491
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:55,798
Steel shop - Rs.1200

492
00:33:56,334 --> 00:33:58,461
Provision shop - Rs.800

493
00:33:58,803 --> 00:34:01,033
Mutton shop - Rs.600

494
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:03,597
Cycle shop - Rs.500

495
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:05,337
Go and collect the entire interest money.

496
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:07,868
If they won't pay, bring their things and
put them into the Jeep.

497
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:10,311
- Go away.
- Take the money.

498
00:34:13,818 --> 00:34:15,479
Balu has reduced his rates!

499
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:20,515
I was wondering
my hair has grown big.

500
00:34:20,658 --> 00:34:22,751
I'll go and cut my hair in his shop.

501
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:26,318
The gardener can cut your hair free.

502
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:28,797
Don't use such dialogues to me.
I will cut off the director!

503
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,561
- You have your action there,
not here. - Got it?

504
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:34,931
Joker has come!

505
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:41,103
Brother! Sir went to his shop
to cut his hair.

506
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:43,111
Let him go.

507
00:34:43,214 --> 00:34:45,273
He went to his shop with hair, didn't he?
Let's see how he will come out.

508
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:48,185
There is no brightness
in your mirror.

509
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:49,679
There is no brightness
at my home.

510
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:50,785
How can it be for mirror?

511
00:34:51,055 --> 00:34:54,388
Are you teasing me?
You arrogant!

512
00:34:56,027 --> 00:34:58,291
My face looks ugly in this mirror.

513
00:34:58,529 --> 00:35:02,124
Not only in mirror, your face
looks ugly in person. Ok. Sit there.

514
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,295
I've come to sit here, alright.

515
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:08,894
- Oh God! My back has broken.
- Oh! My chair too has broken.

516
00:35:09,006 --> 00:35:10,064
Oh God!

517
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:13,337
- Take him out!
- Hold me carefully.

518
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:15,844
Take me safely.

519
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:19,715
- Are you singing situation song?
- That is the music director.

520
00:35:19,984 --> 00:35:23,078
He wouldn't die until his name
comes on the screen.

521
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:25,312
When I am alright,
are you making fun of me?

522
00:35:25,656 --> 00:35:29,285
- Oh God!
- See! His back has broken.

523
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:33,294
- Be careful -Balu tries
to put off your cinema dreams.

524
00:35:33,531 --> 00:35:34,725
Don't leave him.

525
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:37,059
His chair broke
because of his overweight.

526
00:35:37,702 --> 00:35:45,507
Henceforth he should continue his job
at river banks or under the trees. Come.

527
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:47,842
How sad!

528
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:52,879
Bright future is ahead!

529
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:54,608
There is a bright future for this place.

530
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:56,584
The people here
will enjoy a bright life.

531
00:35:56,687 --> 00:36:00,885
Bright future is ahead!

532
00:36:01,425 --> 00:36:03,359
There is a bright future for this place.

533
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:13,897
The prophet used to come
to our house and bless us!

534
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:17,463
But he is predicting
good future for the entire village.

535
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:36,583
Sir! For a month, daily supply 2 bags
of rice, 15 kg tamarind, 10 kg dhal...

536
00:36:36,894 --> 00:36:38,589
10 kg wheat, 10 kg salt and
1 kg Ganneru Pappu(Poison)...

537
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:40,391
If anyone eats Ganneru Pappu,
they will die.

538
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:41,828
That was a slip of the tongue.

539
00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:45,496
If you can't do that, go to town,
buy and deliver all these.

540
00:36:45,636 --> 00:36:46,568
Here is the advance...

541
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,133
Bring those to Ragavendra guest house.

542
00:36:52,843 --> 00:36:54,834
Brother! Every day we want
10 kg mutton in the morning...

543
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:56,704
and 20 kg Kodi flower in the noon.

544
00:36:56,814 --> 00:37:00,409
You fool! We want chicken
but not Kodi flower.

545
00:37:01,852 --> 00:37:02,648
What about you?

546
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:07,758
Have this Rs.5000 and send
everything to Ragavendra guest house.

547
00:37:08,593 --> 00:37:11,824
Daily 50 liters of milk morning and
evening, supply to the guest house.

548
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:22,896
Who are you?
What is your job?

549
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:25,270
My name is Balu.
I am a barber.

550
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:26,699
I am owner of this shop.

551
00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:29,274
We don't have any work with you.
It's ok, have this Rs.1000.

552
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,548
You might have to come to
the guest house to tonsure somebody.

553
00:37:31,949 --> 00:37:33,473
I don't get money without working for it.

554
00:37:33,951 --> 00:37:36,419
Seems you are Veeresalingam
teacher in this village.

555
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:40,286
I have never seen 1000 rupees yet.

556
00:37:40,491 --> 00:37:43,016
You are giving money in plentiful.

557
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,526
- Who are you by the way?
- Don't you watch movies?

558
00:37:45,663 --> 00:37:48,154
We have only Touring talkies
but no cinema hall in our village.

559
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:51,898
In the film credits,
the name Abishek will flash.

560
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:52,866
- Haven't you seen that?
- No sir.

561
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:54,494
What are you doing in movies?

562
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:56,001
What does it mean?

563
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,806
You asked us supply things for 40 days.

564
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:03,343
Is there any marriage or
festival in our place?

565
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:04,539
No marriage and no festival.

566
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:07,314
- We are going to do film shooting
here. - Shooting?

567
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:09,452
Who is hero in the film?

568
00:38:14,725 --> 00:38:15,657
Movie name is Kucheludu.

569
00:38:58,836 --> 00:38:59,666

00:43:52,496 --> 00:43:54,191
Dad's friend, superstar Ashok Kumar!

603
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:56,623
Superstar?

604
00:43:58,202 --> 00:43:59,635
Yes, mom. The whole school
was talking only about this.

605
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:03,367
God! Has super star come to our village?

606
00:44:05,576 --> 00:44:06,668
We want to see him now.

00:44:06,744 --> 00:44:07,608
We want to take a photo with him.

608
00:44:07,911 --> 00:44:09,811
- Let's go now dad.
- Leave my shirt!

609
00:44:10,114 --> 00:44:11,741
Will he come to our house?

610
00:44:12,216 --> 00:44:14,184
No, he will go away
when he sees our old house.

611
00:44:14,852 --> 00:44:15,819
Let us go to his place instead.

612
00:44:17,888 --> 00:44:19,583
When will you take us there?

613
00:44:19,857 --> 00:44:21,381
He has just arrived.

614
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:23,619
Let the shooting start.
I will take you there.

615
00:44:24,728 --> 00:44:26,889
We can go and take a photo with him.

616
00:44:27,531 --> 00:44:28,828
I want to take a photo with him!

617
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:37,263
Dear! Will you take me too with our kids?

618
00:44:39,043 --> 00:44:40,169
- Tell me.
- Dad!

619
00:44:40,611 --> 00:44:42,602
- Will you take me too
with them? - I'll.

620
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:49,416
I will take all of you including
our goat, cow and the hens!

621
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:54,054
Get down!

622
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:55,522
- Do you know who I am?
- Come.

623
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:57,718
Sit here.

624
00:44:59,096 --> 00:45:00,063
Who do you think of me
and made me sit here?

625
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:01,323
Then, I'll make you sleep.

626
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:02,889
Government says to plant
2 trees at each house.

627
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:04,600
Will you grow your moustache like trees?

628
00:45:04,935 --> 00:45:06,163
If you grow thislike
'Bobbili Puli' N.T. R...

629
00:45:07,071 --> 00:45:08,868
...l'll change you as
'Dasarabullodu' A.N.R.

630
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:18,939
Why did you change
my moustache like this?

631
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:23,114
I know well which moustache
will suit for a face.

632
00:45:25,823 --> 00:45:27,916
If face looks round,
thick moustache will suit.

633
00:45:28,358 --> 00:45:30,258
And slim moustache
will suit for a flat nose.

634
00:45:30,527 --> 00:45:32,859
If anyone looks like Charlie Chaplin,
small moustache will suit them.

635
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:36,427
If anyone have Chinese face,
side moustache with gap will suit.

636
00:45:37,434 --> 00:45:38,366
Are you writing it down?

637
00:45:38,769 --> 00:45:40,259
Give me.
Go ahead.

638
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,000
Get all of them into the jeep.

639
00:45:44,274 --> 00:45:49,541
Stop it. Who are you?
Why are you beating my police?

640
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,377
Are you doing haircut keeping
this duplicate police outside?

641
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:52,773
We are the real police.

642
00:45:53,183 --> 00:45:54,207
Our SP sent us a message.

643
00:45:54,685 --> 00:45:56,619
- SP sir? - How dare you
shave off our SP's moustache?

644
00:45:59,623 --> 00:46:00,612
Is he SP?

645
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:02,452
What wrong did I do?

646
00:46:02,826 --> 00:46:06,262
I made your ugly face better.
That's all.

647
00:46:07,131 --> 00:46:09,224
Do you need gloves on your hand?

648
00:46:09,633 --> 00:46:12,261
- There is a ring and watch too.
- I got it on my wedding.

649
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:15,101
You have done haircut on
everyone with these hands?

650
00:46:15,706 --> 00:46:17,435
You shouldn't ever cut hair.

651
00:46:26,917 --> 00:46:30,751
Dear! Can you take us all
tomorrow to see him?

652
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:34,086
Why do you behave like our kids?

653
00:46:34,858 --> 00:46:35,825
What are you telling?

654
00:46:36,894 --> 00:46:38,691
We studied together 30 years ago.

655
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:41,795
During this time,
he might have seen many people.

656
00:46:43,066 --> 00:46:47,503
If I go before him now,
I wonder if he would remember me!

657
00:46:49,339 --> 00:46:53,241
There will be many renowned
people around him.

658
00:46:55,546 --> 00:46:57,104
If I go to him and tell him
I am his old friend...

659
00:46:57,214 --> 00:47:00,308
...he might deny our old friendship!

660
00:47:01,585 --> 00:47:06,488
If at all he remembers me
he might send me away...

661
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:10,424
...doubting that I am seeking
help from him!

662
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:13,895
I won't be able to withstand
the humiliation then!

663
00:47:15,899 --> 00:47:16,695
I won't go to him!

664
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:19,027
Why did you tell our children
that you will take them to him?

665
00:47:19,303 --> 00:47:23,171
He will be here for a few days only
before he goes back!

666
00:47:24,975 --> 00:47:26,033
I will manage them somehow till then.

667
00:47:27,978 --> 00:47:28,808
You don't worry.

668
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:51,762
- Where is the shooting tomorrow?
...that scene in the field!

669
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:53,097
The scene in which
the heroine buys the land.

670
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:56,370
- How far is it from here?
- It is about 12 kms from here.

671
00:47:56,607 --> 00:47:58,097
12 kms? When should I be ready?

672
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:03,470
- Has the director come?
- He'll come by the evening flight.

673
00:48:05,282 --> 00:48:09,150
- Sir! The Collector has come to see you!
- Collector comes to see me?

674
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:16,183
- May God bless you!
- God will bless you too!

675
00:48:16,326 --> 00:48:17,884
- Please take your seat.
- Thank you!

676
00:48:18,262 --> 00:48:19,593
Will you have something?

677
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:20,762
What is the purpose of your visit?

678
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:22,729
You have come for shooting
at the Tamil Nadu border!

679
00:48:23,033 --> 00:48:24,364
This place is infested by naxalites!

680
00:48:24,868 --> 00:48:28,895
We got information from the intelligence
department that your life is at stake.

681
00:48:29,172 --> 00:48:30,264
A threat to my life?

682
00:48:30,374 --> 00:48:33,832
No, We got this information
from Delhi! Not only that.

683
00:48:34,144 --> 00:48:37,580
We have orders to provide you Z category
protection until the shooting gets over!

684
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:41,874
So, don't allow anybody to come near you
until the shooting is over!

685
00:48:42,219 --> 00:48:43,550
People come to Hyderabad to see me...

686
00:48:43,654 --> 00:48:45,645
...boarding train and
Bus, taking too much stress!

687
00:48:46,023 --> 00:48:46,853
But they aren't able to see me there.

688
00:48:47,324 --> 00:48:48,518
I have come to see them at their place...

689
00:48:48,959 --> 00:48:49,948
...and if they are not allowed
to see me in their place...

690
00:48:50,894 --> 00:48:53,021
You can do your duty
and allow us to do our work.

691
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:56,725
If anything happens to you
we will have to face the aftermath.

692
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:09,905
Their shooting is carried out
At the Tamil Nadu and Andhra and borders!

693
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:11,947
Have you arranged for the police
from both the states for protection?

694
00:49:12,049 --> 00:49:12,845
Yes, we have done it sir.

695
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:16,476
Yet I prefer if you
visited the spot once.

696
00:49:21,024 --> 00:49:22,491
See that no one comes beyond the barrier.

697
00:49:24,861 --> 00:49:26,260
- Place our men around the guest house!
- Ok, sir.

698
00:49:27,531 --> 00:49:30,591
Boss!

699
00:49:30,934 --> 00:49:31,764
The Superstar has come to our place.

700
00:49:32,336 --> 00:49:35,669
- Superstar? - Yes sir.
- To our place? - Yes sir.

701
00:49:36,039 --> 00:49:37,666
He will be here for 40 days
for the shooting.

702
00:49:38,075 --> 00:49:40,339
We need not go
to the Jambara hills to meet him.

703
00:49:40,544 --> 00:49:42,273
It is not Jambara hills
but Banjara hills.

704
00:49:42,379 --> 00:49:43,641
Don't mind that hills.

705
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:45,372
He has come to our place any way.

706
00:49:46,183 --> 00:49:48,845
- How could We see him then?
- Boss! You are a big man in this place.

707
00:49:49,086 --> 00:49:50,849
No one has the guts to stop you.
Come, let's go.

708
00:49:51,955 --> 00:49:52,887
The shooting is on out of the village.

709
00:49:53,357 --> 00:49:56,815
We will meet the superstar and
get his call sheet to act in our film.

710
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:58,027
What sheets?

711
00:49:58,228 --> 00:50:01,686
Call sheet is the one which they give us
if we give them money for acting.

712
00:50:02,265 --> 00:50:03,892
We want that sheets immediately.

713
00:50:04,368 --> 00:50:06,063
We have to start the film with Superstar.

714
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:09,828
- As name of producer?
- Sirisilla Karmaraju!

715
00:50:10,107 --> 00:50:11,267
That's your dad's name.

716
00:50:11,641 --> 00:50:14,166
My name is Sirisilla Dharmaraju.

717
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:19,206
My name should come
in your place as the director.

718
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:20,380
Come, let's go to the vacation.

719
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:22,711
- It's location not vacation.
- Come, let's go there. - Come.

720
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:26,016
- Dad, Come.
- Tell me.

721
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:29,848
You told that you will take us
to see the superstar on Sunday.

722
00:50:30,093 --> 00:50:32,493
Dad doesn't know where the shooting is.

723
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:35,764
Even a baby knows that
the shooting is in the grove.

724
00:50:36,099 --> 00:50:39,296
I know that, but I don't know
if it is in the hill or river side.

725
00:50:39,569 --> 00:50:41,696
We can find out that easily.

726
00:50:41,805 --> 00:50:43,329
Come, let us go.

727
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:46,809
You may become ill if you stand
in the sun and watch the shooting!

728
00:50:47,077 --> 00:50:48,169
We don't care, should we
even contract Typhoid.

729
00:50:48,345 --> 00:50:49,437
Take us there.

730
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:52,773
- Come dad!
- Ok.

731
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:54,108
I will go first and see him.

732
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:57,780
I will get permission
to bring my wife and kids.

733
00:50:57,888 --> 00:51:01,051
Then, I will take you all there.

734
00:51:01,958 --> 00:51:03,585
Thank God! Today I've escaped from them.

735
00:51:08,365 --> 00:51:09,730
Nobody is seen anywhere.

736
00:51:09,866 --> 00:51:15,600
- The village looks deserted.
- All have gone to watch the shooting!

737
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:17,604
Nobody has opened their shops
except Balu and me.

738
00:51:22,012 --> 00:51:23,946
- Look! Vijay Kumar!
- Yes!

739
00:51:24,281 --> 00:51:25,441
Look! Nayanthara is so pretty!

740
00:51:25,849 --> 00:51:27,476
Where is Boss gone?

741
00:51:27,951 --> 00:51:31,114
You are looking at Nayanthara only!
Have a glimpse on us, Boss.

742
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:40,723
This location was selected by me.

743
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:42,788
I've to find another location.

744
00:51:44,134 --> 00:51:48,127
- Don't make fuss.
- Move away.

745
00:51:48,672 --> 00:51:50,299
- Move away. - Don't shout.
I am telling to you.

746
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:52,340
- Our boss has come!
- Why do you create mischief?

747
00:51:52,742 --> 00:51:54,767
- Do you know who he is?
- Who is it?

748
00:51:54,878 --> 00:51:56,175
He is a landlord at our place.

749
00:51:56,346 --> 00:51:58,007
I don't care for anyone.
Go and stay aside.

750
00:51:58,315 --> 00:51:59,282
Talk with respect.

751
00:51:59,416 --> 00:52:01,213
- Do you know What Will happen
if he wants? - What will happen?

752
00:52:01,585 --> 00:52:04,019
Don't you know how
to talk with village people?

753
00:52:04,221 --> 00:52:05,245
Why do you say go away?

754
00:52:05,555 --> 00:52:07,546
- What?
- Shut up and go away.

755
00:52:07,757 --> 00:52:10,521
He is going to take a film
with the superstar and become famous!

756
00:52:10,894 --> 00:52:13,624
- Don't you let him go there.
- Sir! You come. Move away.

757
00:52:14,231 --> 00:52:16,358
Oh gosh!

758
00:52:16,766 --> 00:52:18,893
Go away.

759
00:52:19,769 --> 00:52:24,797
I want to take a photo with sir
before returning back to my village.

760
00:52:25,575 --> 00:52:27,770
I mean it will look well
with my dress on.

761
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:33,749
Look! The shooting will start
after clap of the board.

762
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:39,778
We have to finish
this work in the evening.

763
00:52:40,223 --> 00:52:41,315
You have to work
very efficiently for that.

764
00:52:42,192 --> 00:52:45,059
Only then we can go
to the next field to work.

765
00:53:12,556 --> 00:53:13,750
They shouldn't do agriculture here

766
00:53:14,558 --> 00:53:16,082
Ask all of them leave this place.

767
00:53:16,726 --> 00:53:17,920
I have bought this place.

768
00:53:18,395 --> 00:53:20,260
This site is earmarked for IT park.

769
00:53:20,931 --> 00:53:23,456
We depend on this farmland.

770
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:29,032
Where will we go if you acquire
our land of cultivation?

771
00:53:29,806 --> 00:53:33,071
We cannot live without doing agriculture.

772
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:34,477
This is all our fate.

773
00:53:34,844 --> 00:53:36,675
I've bought this land for 3 crores!

774
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:38,378
Day after tomorrow is the registration.

775
00:53:57,968 --> 00:54:02,132
You have blocked the land
by giving 3 lakh rupees as advance.

776
00:54:02,305 --> 00:54:06,469
Our boss has registered
the land giving 3 crores!

777
00:54:06,643 --> 00:54:07,974
You can't build an IT park here!

778
00:54:08,178 --> 00:54:09,338
...only agriculture!

779
00:54:12,716 --> 00:54:15,617
- Who are you?
- Simha! Narasimha.

780
00:54:16,486 --> 00:54:17,919
- Part 2!
- Not only this.

781
00:54:18,221 --> 00:54:21,486
I will buy acres of land near this
and change it to high - tech city!

782
00:54:21,958 --> 00:54:22,822
Where else have you bought the land?

783
00:54:23,159 --> 00:54:24,717
I bought 200 acres of
land in Vizag...

784
00:54:25,128 --> 00:54:27,619
...100 acres in Vijayawada,
and 150 acres in Hyderabad!

785
00:54:28,131 --> 00:54:28,927
And here now.

786
00:54:29,399 --> 00:54:31,993
I will buy lands in several
places in Andhra Pradesh.

787
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:34,863
You are boasting that you have
bought lands at various places.

788
00:54:34,971 --> 00:54:37,235
The land is permanent
not the buyers.

789
00:54:37,807 --> 00:54:39,707
If you buy the land and
construct buildings...

790
00:54:39,809 --> 00:54:41,436
...and change it into IT city,
your grand children will...

791
00:54:41,645 --> 00:54:44,170
...have to suffer without food.

792
00:54:44,481 --> 00:54:46,312
You can get anything
for price in this world.

793
00:54:46,416 --> 00:54:48,850
But you can't make a price for the food.
Remember one thing.

794
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:50,886
If you have your food and keep idle
you will be the sufferer!

795
00:54:50,987 --> 00:54:53,285
If you keep the money, you earned
with you your life will be in ruins.

796
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:57,326
Live and let others live!
Don't try to spoil the lives of others!

797
00:54:58,028 --> 00:54:59,359
You know that my way is straight way.

798
00:54:59,663 --> 00:55:01,187
Do you feel your body shivering?

799
00:55:07,937 --> 00:55:09,097
This is my style.

800
00:55:09,873 --> 00:55:10,897
See you.

801
00:55:14,778 --> 00:55:16,302
I think, shot is okay.

802
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:23,843
Superb Mr. Ashok Kumar!

803
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:30,016
He is peaceful... good character...
and gives respect!

804
00:55:30,527 --> 00:55:33,655
God creates only a few
like him with superior qualities.

805
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:34,660
Whom are you referring to?

806
00:55:34,798 --> 00:55:37,358
- He refers to the superstar only!
- Is it?

807
00:55:37,867 --> 00:55:40,358
He is broad minded and humble!

808
00:55:40,537 --> 00:55:45,531
He got up when I told my name
and asked me to sit.

809
00:55:45,709 --> 00:55:48,678
- I was very much excited.
- Really?

810
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:50,574
The new actors are very pretentious.

811
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,745
He looks like
he is doing his first movie.

812
00:55:52,949 --> 00:55:54,712
He is really a superstar!

813
00:55:55,118 --> 00:55:57,109
I told him that I wanted
to make a film with him.

814
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:59,117
He gave me the sheet right away.

815
00:55:59,322 --> 00:56:00,254
- What sheet is that?
- Call sheet!

816
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:01,716
Exactly!

817
00:56:01,991 --> 00:56:04,858
I invited him to my house to dine
and he accepted it right away.

818
00:56:04,994 --> 00:56:06,518
- To dine!
- Not only to dine.

819
00:56:06,896 --> 00:56:08,955
He asked him how many
bottles of scotch he needed.

820
00:56:09,232 --> 00:56:12,861
You tend to blabber too much.
Cut it short.

821
00:56:13,303 --> 00:56:16,932
No one is allowed to see the shooting.

822
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,772
They have stopped beyond 300 meters!

823
00:56:20,076 --> 00:56:21,065
Too many policemen are there.

824
00:56:21,411 --> 00:56:25,006
Black cats stand there
guarding him with rifles!

825
00:56:25,448 --> 00:56:29,111
What are you saying?
Boss has just met him and spoken to him.

826
00:56:29,285 --> 00:56:30,616
Is he?

827
00:56:30,987 --> 00:56:34,479
- I saw the police beat him like thief.
- Is it?

828
00:56:35,024 --> 00:56:37,515
I saw that while he was running,
his dhoti stripped out.

829
00:56:37,694 --> 00:56:40,492
- Really?
- Where did you get this dhoti?

830
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:42,925
That is mine.
That is why I am still in the jeep.

831
00:56:43,299 --> 00:56:46,063
Start the jeep.
We don't have work with them.

832
00:56:46,202 --> 00:56:48,193
They feel envy seeing others' good.

833
00:56:48,304 --> 00:56:51,467
- I'll see them later.
- Shut up and mind your work.

834
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:53,474
If I increase interest,
then they'll know who I am.

835
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:55,441
See you!

836
00:56:56,279 --> 00:56:58,440
When the boss had a tough time...

837
00:56:58,548 --> 00:57:00,516
...I wonder how I'm going
to meet the superstar.

838
00:57:00,984 --> 00:57:03,179
Sona! My wife Sona!

839
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:05,713
I have earned the money for you!

840
00:57:07,791 --> 00:57:10,385
You used to come very dull
and today you seem to be very joyous!

841
00:57:11,361 --> 00:57:14,091
I have kept my word... and that's why.

842
00:57:14,464 --> 00:57:15,294
Here is 1000 rupees.

843
00:57:20,203 --> 00:57:21,636
Really, your are very smart!

844
00:57:23,339 --> 00:57:26,638
- But that won't be enough.
- Not enough?

845
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:30,875
- The Super star has come
to our place for shooting! - So what?

846
00:57:31,181 --> 00:57:35,174
Should I cut his hair and shave
and bring a lot of money?

847
00:57:35,318 --> 00:57:37,445
I didn't ask you to do that.

848
00:57:37,754 --> 00:57:41,190
Go and get his permission.
Let us take a photograph with him.

849
00:57:41,357 --> 00:57:43,689
A photograph?
What happened to you?

850
00:57:43,827 --> 00:57:45,158
- It won't happen.
- It should happen.

851
00:57:45,628 --> 00:57:47,653
Only then, I will agree for your wish.

852
00:57:47,831 --> 00:57:51,062
What is that? I won't get mood
if you give these conditions.

853
00:57:52,836 --> 00:57:54,599
Getting a ticket for
his movie is a tough thing!

854
00:57:54,771 --> 00:57:57,001
How am I going to get his permission
for taking photograph?

855
00:57:57,941 --> 00:58:00,341
My situation is to go after
match box to light the cigarette.

856
00:58:02,779 --> 00:58:04,872
Put back in the water
if it is a big fish.

857
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:07,616
Catch only the small fish.
Ashok Kumar like only those.

858
00:58:08,685 --> 00:58:10,152
Sir! He is there

859
00:58:12,388 --> 00:58:14,015
Go and tell him about me.

860
00:58:14,524 --> 00:58:16,458
What? Didn't you get any
small fish there? Do one thing.

861
00:58:16,626 --> 00:58:20,062
Take the big fish and cut those
into small fish size and fry it.

862
00:58:20,864 --> 00:58:23,332
I am doing it for the past 12 years.

863
00:58:23,867 --> 00:58:25,732
A production manager
cannot be straight forward.

864
00:58:25,935 --> 00:58:28,665
He has to do some fraud work.
He is the manger. No, damager.

865
00:58:28,805 --> 00:58:30,363
Hang up your phone.
The bill is coming.

866
00:58:32,075 --> 00:58:33,542
Who are you? You appear
like the ghost in the noon.

867
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:35,675
Leave me.
Look! Our sir is there.

868
00:58:36,546 --> 00:58:38,013
- I mean... the boss.
- So What?

869
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:41,946
He is a very rich man.
He has estates, bungalow etc.,

870
00:58:42,285 --> 00:58:43,252
He has enough respect in this place.

871
00:58:43,453 --> 00:58:45,546
Ask him to give his estates,
bungalow etc., in his name.

872
00:58:45,755 --> 00:58:48,087
- I too Will give him respect.
- You don't know about him, shut up.

873
00:58:48,791 --> 00:58:51,282
If you want he can finance you too.

874
00:58:51,427 --> 00:58:54,396
I think he is a fool who is ready
to finance a stranger like me.

875
00:58:54,564 --> 00:58:56,293
He wants to talk something with you.
Please come there once.

876
00:58:56,466 --> 00:58:57,763
- Doesn't he has one?
- What?

877
00:58:57,901 --> 00:58:59,061
- I mean leg.
- He has 2 legs.

878
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:01,632
He is a big boss sir.
Come once.

879
00:59:02,405 --> 00:59:03,531
Tell him.

880
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:06,404
My boss is richer than yours.
Ask him to come here.

881
00:59:06,676 --> 00:59:08,576
Ok. He hasn't made me to get hurt.

882
00:59:08,745 --> 00:59:09,712
What is he telling?

883
00:59:09,946 --> 00:59:12,744
- He does not come to a compromise.
- I told you that I Will finance him.

884
00:59:12,916 --> 00:59:18,183
He says he is not ready to see
a slimy and nasty guy like you.

885
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:21,180
He seems to be a smarter guy than you.

886
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:25,756
- It looks like your own dialogue.
- Oh God! I didn't say it. He only said.

887
00:59:25,895 --> 00:59:29,592
- I'll settle this matter personally.
- Go.

888
00:59:31,134 --> 00:59:33,364
- You don't know my name.
- Lf you say, I'll know.

889
00:59:34,037 --> 00:59:35,800
My name is Boss Dharmaraju!

890
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:38,097
Have you added 'Boss' before your name?

891
00:59:38,441 --> 00:59:39,806
The people call me respectfully.

892
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:41,737
I want to make a film.

893
00:59:42,011 --> 00:59:44,479
For that, you have to get
the sheet from the super star.

894
00:59:44,814 --> 00:59:48,648
- What? - It's a sheet.
- Is It the bed sheet? - That is...

895
00:59:49,786 --> 00:59:52,755
I think the people in
this place have gone crazy.

896
00:59:53,122 --> 00:59:54,885
Not like that.
You should help me.

897
00:59:55,325 --> 00:59:56,849
You should introduce me
to the superstar.

898
00:59:58,094 --> 01:00:00,392
You know who he is?
He is the leaping tiger.

899
01:00:00,663 --> 01:00:03,154
If he leaps on you,
your dhoti will strip out.

900
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:04,692
However, you introduce me to him.

901
01:00:05,368 --> 01:00:07,233
- It's not your hands.
- Leave this. It's gold chain.

902
01:00:08,171 --> 01:00:12,335
If you introduce me to him,
I'll bring you enough fish you need.

903
01:00:13,042 --> 01:00:14,475
Keep your fishes with you.

904
01:00:14,711 --> 01:00:17,271
He is not acting in any stranger's movies.
He is making his own movies.

905
01:00:17,547 --> 01:00:18,605
You can go now.

906
01:00:19,148 --> 01:00:21,548
I beg you sir.
Please help me sir.

907
01:00:22,485 --> 01:00:25,045
- Go away, don't give me tension?
- Go away. - He has gone.

908
01:00:26,656 --> 01:00:29,181
- Yet haven't you got a single fish?
- Keep trying.

909
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:33,562
- Oh gosh!
- Start the jeep.

910
01:00:33,696 --> 01:00:35,493
Drive the jeep.
He'll kill, if we get caught.

911
01:00:37,266 --> 01:00:38,290
Why do you laugh?

912
01:00:59,288 --> 01:01:01,552
- Welcome.
- Greetings!

913
01:01:02,158 --> 01:01:03,591
Now he is not at home.

914
01:01:07,363 --> 01:01:08,159
Thank God!

915
01:01:14,871 --> 01:01:15,838
What happened?
The school van has come.

916
01:01:16,139 --> 01:01:19,006
Dear! The principal and sister
of Shoba's school have come.

917
01:01:19,142 --> 01:01:21,235
- Oh God! I'll run from here...
- Where are you running?

918
01:01:21,744 --> 01:01:23,268
They could have come for Shoba fees!
I'll go from here.

919
01:01:24,147 --> 01:01:26,081
Shoba has not gone to school.
Why worry then?

920
01:01:26,282 --> 01:01:27,909
What about the fees of the other two?

921
01:01:28,918 --> 01:01:31,352
- You are right, isn't it?
- I am right.

922
01:01:31,554 --> 01:01:33,681
- Balu!
- I am coming sister.

923
01:01:34,057 --> 01:01:36,116
You go in the front.
I will follow you.

924
01:01:36,292 --> 01:01:38,453
See! How they look.

925
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:42,392
- Oh gosh!
- Walk straight.

926
01:01:42,765 --> 01:01:44,198
I will sell the goat today
and pay the fees.

927
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:45,364
Please sit.

928
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:46,691
Put the bench for them.
They'll sit.

929
01:01:47,003 --> 01:01:47,867
The leg of the bench is shaky.

930
01:01:48,071 --> 01:01:50,539
The chair in my shop is also shaky.
Our family is shaking altogether.

931
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:53,067
No problem Balu.
There is no time to sit.

932
01:01:53,943 --> 01:01:56,605
I gave a thought about
what you said the other day.

933
01:01:56,813 --> 01:01:58,610
I wouldn't say anything to think over.

934
01:01:58,781 --> 01:02:02,444
You told me I shouldn't
get angry as a nun.

935
01:02:02,652 --> 01:02:04,620
It was just a prattle.

936
01:02:04,987 --> 01:02:06,750
I thought what you said is right.

937
01:02:07,323 --> 01:02:11,885
It is in the Bible that God
created man as a virtuous being.

938
01:02:12,195 --> 01:02:14,561
It was the human
who created all problems.

939
01:02:14,931 --> 01:02:17,764
Man only has created the school fees.

940
01:02:18,768 --> 01:02:23,535
So we took the fees
from our school fund.

941
01:02:25,174 --> 01:02:27,438
You send Shoba
to school from tomorrow.

942
01:02:28,644 --> 01:02:30,271
Don't mistake me.

943
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,541
We have money problems only recently.

944
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:35,411
That's why we could not pay the fees.

945
01:02:35,685 --> 01:02:37,118
It is not my idea to educate
my girl with your money.

946
01:02:38,521 --> 01:02:40,648
See how broad-minded he is.

947
01:02:40,857 --> 01:02:41,755
Go and bring tea for them!

948
01:02:41,891 --> 01:02:44,655
- There is no milk. - Don't bother.
Black tea will do for us.

949
01:02:44,894 --> 01:02:46,885
- Get black tea then.
- There is no sugar.

950
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:49,792
I have sugar problem.
Don't put sugar in the tea.

951
01:02:50,199 --> 01:02:51,996
We have no sugar problem
and we have no sugar in our house.

952
01:02:54,637 --> 01:02:56,628
Balu! Have you seen your old friend?

953
01:02:57,073 --> 01:02:57,937
Old friend?

954
01:02:58,141 --> 01:03:00,575
The super star and you are friends
since your young age, right?

955
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:04,976
No. We knew of this when the teacher
of your second daughter told us.

956
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:09,718
Don't worry. We wont
tell anybody in the school.

957
01:03:10,486 --> 01:03:12,545
You are very smart!

958
01:03:13,089 --> 01:03:14,989
You didn't tell us about
your friend ship in the...

959
01:03:15,491 --> 01:03:17,618
...parents teachers meeting
or when you came to...

960
01:03:17,994 --> 01:03:19,928
...us to talk about the school fees!

961
01:03:20,029 --> 01:03:21,758
- This is not real...
- You are going to say nothing.

962
01:03:22,765 --> 01:03:24,528
What did I tell you
While we were on our way?

963
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:27,595
That Balu won't boast to anyone!

964
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:29,835
Our school silver jubilee
is being celebrated!

965
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:32,903
It is our fortune, as the superstar
has come to our place at this juncture.

966
01:03:33,376 --> 01:03:36,641
You have to bring the super star
to our school function.

967
01:03:36,913 --> 01:03:37,937
It won't happen.

968
01:03:38,414 --> 01:03:39,779
Why won't it happen?

969
01:03:40,149 --> 01:03:42,515
He is like that.
He thinks for everything.

970
01:03:42,685 --> 01:03:44,414
If he can't bring him, I will bring him.

971
01:03:44,554 --> 01:03:45,521
What do you say?

972
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:50,888
I will go, introduce myself
as his friend's wife and bring him here.

973
01:03:51,093 --> 01:03:52,287
Don't worry sister.

974
01:03:54,197 --> 01:03:57,166
- See you then!
- See you.

975
01:03:58,467 --> 01:03:59,627
What do you mean?

976
01:03:59,769 --> 01:04:02,966
Are you not worried about
the future of your children?

977
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:06,498
Will you bring him or
should I go and bring him?

978
01:04:08,878 --> 01:04:09,810
I will go and bring him.

979
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:11,673
- Ok.
- Oh gosh!

980
01:04:22,658 --> 01:04:23,989
Have you no other work?

981
01:04:24,126 --> 01:04:26,924
Why do you make a mess of this place?

982
01:04:27,296 --> 01:04:28,422
We are so eager to see our matinee idol...

983
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:31,022
...as he has come here for the first time!

984
01:04:31,968 --> 01:04:35,961
We expect from him only
to acknowledge our presence here.

985
01:04:36,072 --> 01:04:36,868
No chance. Go away.

986
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:45,772
What a crowd?

987
01:04:46,182 --> 01:04:47,513
People from Andhra and
Tamil Nadu are here.

988
01:04:50,853 --> 01:04:53,686
I wonder if I could get permission
from him braving this crowd...

989
01:04:53,823 --> 01:04:55,450
...to take our photograph with him.

990
01:04:56,192 --> 01:04:57,250
What should I do?

991
01:04:58,094 --> 01:05:00,995
- Boss! Shall I Tell you a superb idea?
- Tell me.

992
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:02,527
There is a wall, isn't it?

993
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:04,662
If you manage to jump
and cross the wall...

994
01:05:05,334 --> 01:05:06,995
...you can reach your destination.

995
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:09,428
I'll increase your salary.

996
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:13,239
Why is so much crowd here?

997
01:05:13,743 --> 01:05:16,337
Women also present here
Leaving their cooking.

998
01:05:16,679 --> 01:05:17,577
No one has seen me.

999
01:05:18,147 --> 01:05:19,671
This place is not crowded.

1000
01:05:23,386 --> 01:05:27,186
The tower is tall
as Great Wall of China!

1001
01:05:28,457 --> 01:05:30,288
Should I bear these troubles
for 5 minutes honeymoon?

1002
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:35,930
I am very lucky person.

1003
01:05:44,006 --> 01:05:46,474
- Move the wall.
- The wall is moving!

1004
01:05:46,609 --> 01:05:49,942
The wall is used for shooting!
Oh God!

1005
01:06:01,190 --> 01:06:04,421
The wall and the well are duplicates.

1006
01:06:04,894 --> 01:06:07,089
Did you tell me that
my destination is the well?

1007
01:06:08,331 --> 01:06:11,357
There are many people crowded
before the guest house.

1008
01:06:11,734 --> 01:06:14,362
If you can wave your hand,
half of the crowd will disperse.

1009
01:06:15,071 --> 01:06:17,198
You are responsible for the protection.
I didn't ask you.

1010
01:06:17,573 --> 01:06:20,701
Police cannot control the crowd.

1011
01:06:21,043 --> 01:06:23,375
If we want to control them,
we have to use lathi charge.

1012
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:25,547
Control the people
but don't beat them.

1013
01:06:25,948 --> 01:06:27,848
I don't like my fans getting beaten up.

1014
01:07:10,893 --> 01:07:11,860
Stop there.

1015
01:07:30,312 --> 01:07:33,975
His efforts will continue...

1016
01:07:38,521 --> 01:07:40,318
- Stop it.
- What do you want?

1017
01:07:40,456 --> 01:07:42,287
To see him, we have
walked for 3 days...

1018
01:07:42,425 --> 01:07:43,892
...and have covered 100 kms distance.

1019
01:07:43,993 --> 01:07:44,891
We want to see him.

1020
01:07:45,027 --> 01:07:45,994
- Then, do one thing
- What?

1021
01:07:46,128 --> 01:07:49,188
Be calm. He'll wave his hand from
the balcony. You can go off after that.

1022
01:07:49,331 --> 01:07:53,995
No. We want to see him and
give a petition to the Super star.

1023
01:07:54,136 --> 01:07:56,104
- Only then we'll go.
- That is not possible, go off.

1024
01:07:56,205 --> 01:07:58,765
Should we go from here?
We will be here for days for that.

1025
01:07:58,908 --> 01:08:01,172
We won't go from here.
You can do what you want.

1026
01:08:01,343 --> 01:08:03,106
Come on guys.

1027
01:08:10,719 --> 01:08:14,348
- Sister! Look there!
- What is that?

1028
01:08:14,490 --> 01:08:16,924
That is the guest house
where the super star stays.

1029
01:08:17,059 --> 01:08:18,686
It looks like a festival!

1030
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:22,030
The whole place is celebrating
for his arrival!

1031
01:08:22,131 --> 01:08:24,099
I wonder when we will be able to see him!

1032
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:26,427
Shall we get a chance
to see him or not?

1033
01:08:26,535 --> 01:08:39,039
<i>Oh Lord! Lord of Thirumala!</i>
<i>Have a look at us!</i>

1034
01:08:39,148 --> 01:08:44,211
<i>Our folk's hearts are diamonds.</i>
<i>Come on burnish it.</i>

1035
01:08:56,999 --> 01:09:00,059
Oh God!

1036
01:09:02,271 --> 01:09:05,707
We request you to be calm, folks!

1037
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:09,039
He'll come out in the morning.
Don't shout.

1038
01:09:12,314 --> 01:09:13,338
For whom is sir waiting for?

1039
01:09:13,549 --> 01:09:15,744
His friends are coming
from Japan to photograph with him.

1040
01:09:16,018 --> 01:09:20,284
I too want to take a photograph
with him with this dress.

1041
01:09:20,422 --> 01:09:22,686
You can have it later.
Go and take care of the guest.

1042
01:09:38,474 --> 01:09:39,498
Sit here.

1043
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:51,248
They want to be with you for a day,
watch the shooting...

1044
01:09:51,387 --> 01:09:52,877
...and take photograph
with you before they go.

1045
01:09:53,122 --> 01:09:54,089
Ok! You look into this.

1046
01:10:03,365 --> 01:10:05,299
Bring Japan tea for them.

1047
01:10:05,668 --> 01:10:08,535
You are letting in the foreigners
to see him keeping the natives outside.

1048
01:10:08,671 --> 01:10:11,037
We've come from so far to see him.

1049
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:12,801
Please let us go inside.

1050
01:10:15,544 --> 01:10:16,806
Please try to disperse the crowd.

1051
01:10:17,112 --> 01:10:20,878
They have been shouting all day
and spoiling others' sleep.

1052
01:10:21,083 --> 01:10:24,541
We can't beat them or take
any action against them.

1053
01:10:24,687 --> 01:10:26,086
They are fans.

1054
01:10:26,288 --> 01:10:28,552
Request sir for a meeting with them.

1055
01:10:28,691 --> 01:10:31,956
You won't get sleep
until he sees them...

1056
01:10:32,094 --> 01:10:34,562
...even if it means days.
Then its your wish.

1057
01:10:40,035 --> 01:10:42,094
Select 4 among them
and send them in.

1058
01:10:42,805 --> 01:10:44,466
Four among you can come in.

1059
01:10:48,811 --> 01:10:51,075
Sir! Your acting was superb
in 'Sneham Kosam' movie.

1060
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:52,839
You should do so many movies.

1061
01:10:55,117 --> 01:10:57,881
Super Star sir!

1062
01:10:58,988 --> 01:11:03,516
<i>God! Thirumala deity!</i>
<i>Look at us!</i>

1063
01:11:03,659 --> 01:11:06,389
Ok! I am very happy.

1064
01:11:06,762 --> 01:11:07,751
Sit.

1065
01:11:09,665 --> 01:11:12,065
You've come to meet me
with such a love. Sit

1066
01:11:12,234 --> 01:11:15,067
You are the first man to tell us
to sit in our lifetime.

1067
01:11:15,204 --> 01:11:18,230
- The police men tried to send
us away from here. - Sit

1068
01:11:18,407 --> 01:11:19,374
Sit.

1069
01:11:21,677 --> 01:11:23,941
- Please take this sir.
- What is it? - It is a petition, sir.

1070
01:11:24,079 --> 01:11:26,411
I am not a minister.
I am only an actor.

1071
01:11:26,515 --> 01:11:29,313
This is to be given to you,
not to a minister.

1072
01:11:29,418 --> 01:11:30,385
Tell me what is written in it!

1073
01:11:30,519 --> 01:11:34,546
Sir! Long ago Hero NTR
danced in a film for us...

1074
01:11:34,690 --> 01:11:41,653
<i>If you work hard,</i>
<i>you'll achieve anything.</i>

1075
01:11:41,930 --> 01:11:45,457
There was enough respect
for him among people!

1076
01:11:45,801 --> 01:11:50,500
If you dance wearing our costume once
our status will rise among people.

1077
01:11:50,639 --> 01:11:53,107
Our community will rejoice it.

1078
01:11:53,208 --> 01:11:54,140
I'll beg you sir.

1079
01:11:54,243 --> 01:11:56,177
They are great men.
Why do you compare me to them?

1080
01:11:56,345 --> 01:12:00,008
Your movies run well in US,
Australia, Japan and Djakarta.

1081
01:12:00,249 --> 01:12:02,274
If you act in a movie like us...

1082
01:12:02,518 --> 01:12:04,679
...we will become known
to other countries.

1083
01:12:04,887 --> 01:12:09,881
We will get visa and
roam all over the countries.

1084
01:12:10,192 --> 01:12:12,456
I will try to bring
a solution to your woes.

1085
01:12:12,561 --> 01:12:15,689
- Would you like to have something?
- That's okay sir!

1086
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:17,560
Sir is a nice person.

1087
01:12:17,733 --> 01:12:20,099
Former heroes have become
chief ministers after acting like us.

1088
01:12:20,369 --> 01:12:22,337
If nowadays heroes wear our costume?

1089
01:12:22,504 --> 01:12:27,066
You are talking
about movies and politics.

1090
01:12:27,276 --> 01:12:29,836
Despite being illiterates
how do you tell about film industry?

1091
01:12:29,978 --> 01:12:31,138
We saw him in the net sir.

1092
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:32,372
What net? The one you catch birds with?

1093
01:12:32,548 --> 01:12:34,812
- In the internet!
- What is it?

1094
01:12:35,017 --> 01:12:36,848
- Do you carry a laptop in
your Dalda tin? - No.

1095
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:38,618
Here it is.

1096
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:46,391
Super star arranged
his shooting in our place...

1097
01:12:46,595 --> 01:12:47,960
...so that he could meet my husband!

1098
01:12:48,130 --> 01:12:51,361
Since when your husband
and the Super star were friends?

1099
01:12:51,533 --> 01:12:52,659
Are you asking me that?

1100
01:12:52,868 --> 01:12:55,132
They both studied
together in the college.

1101
01:12:55,237 --> 01:12:58,172
Once, the superstar fell in the water
and was about to drown!

1102
01:12:58,374 --> 01:12:59,807
It was my husband who saved him then!

1103
01:12:59,942 --> 01:13:02,069
He used to tell me this often.

1104
01:13:02,211 --> 01:13:04,873
Did your husband study in the college?

1105
01:13:05,748 --> 01:13:09,047
Then what? He clears
all doubts for my daughter,

1106
01:13:09,218 --> 01:13:10,617
...who studies in the tenth.

1107
01:13:11,086 --> 01:13:14,180
Balu really looks like an intelligent.

1108
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:17,416
Your husband is very intimate
to Ashok Kumar.

1109
01:13:17,593 --> 01:13:19,424
Why didn't he become an actor then?

1110
01:13:20,028 --> 01:13:24,192
Ashok Kumar asked my husband many
times to do brother's role in movies.

1111
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:28,234
He refused the offer as he had
to touch the girls in the film.

1112
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:30,133
He was offered a lot of money.

1113
01:13:30,973 --> 01:13:34,534
He refused the money and
the offer as he was not interested.

1114
01:13:34,676 --> 01:13:37,110
Your husband is not willing
to accept money for anything.

1115
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:41,478
He is offered job and enough money
which he refused to accept.

1116
01:13:41,683 --> 01:13:43,617
He might be an impeccable man then.

1117
01:13:49,191 --> 01:13:52,558
Women are experts in spreading rumors.

1118
01:14:19,254 --> 01:14:23,554
<i>Come Ramaiya brother!</i>
<i>Do you know Super star?</i>

1119
01:14:23,725 --> 01:14:27,923
<i>Go, you fool.</i>
<i>Super star is in our soul.</i>

1120
01:14:28,096 --> 01:14:32,328
<i>If earthquake comes as a man,</i>
<i>it's only Super star.</i>

1121
01:14:32,468 --> 01:14:36,734
<i>Super star is elder brother</i>
<i>to all the brothers.</i>

1122
01:14:36,872 --> 01:14:41,070
<i>There is only one name</i>
<i>from everything</i>

1123
01:14:41,176 --> 01:14:45,169
<i>That is our 'Super star'</i>

1124
01:14:45,347 --> 01:14:49,078
<i>With Super star...</i>

1125
01:14:49,718 --> 01:14:55,247
<i>The one who played games in childhood</i>
<i>is our Bumper star Balu!</i>

1126
01:14:58,727 --> 01:15:03,027
<i>Come Ramaiya brother!</i>
<i>Do you know Super star?</i>

1127
01:15:03,165 --> 01:15:07,431
<i>Go, you fool.</i>
<i>Super star is in our soul.</i>

1128
01:15:07,569 --> 01:15:11,767
<i>If earthquake comes as a man,</i>
<i>it's only Super star.</i>

1129
01:15:11,907 --> 01:15:16,276
<i>Super star is elder brother</i>
<i>to this your brothers.</i>

1130
01:15:55,817 --> 01:16:00,151
<i>His scissors move</i>
<i>on our hair clickety-click</i>

1131
01:16:00,255 --> 01:16:04,487
<i>When we hear those sounds</i>
<i>we forget the time.</i>

1132
01:16:04,626 --> 01:16:08,858
<i>You reduce the burden</i>
<i>of hair in our head</i>

1133
01:16:08,964 --> 01:16:12,900
<i>He helps us to look</i>
<i>smart and beautiful.</i>

1134
01:16:13,001 --> 01:16:17,062
<i>Those who vow</i>
<i>to offer hair to God...</i>

1135
01:16:17,205 --> 01:16:21,539
<i>... would seek him to become holy</i>

1136
01:16:21,643 --> 01:16:25,875
<i>Let it be a minister,</i>
<i>the Chief minister or anyone...</i>

1137
01:16:25,981 --> 01:16:30,281
<i>... they should bow to him</i>
<i>when he requires</i>

1138
01:16:35,424 --> 01:16:39,622
<i>Come Ramaiya brother!</i>
<i>Do you know Super star?</i>

1139
01:16:39,728 --> 01:16:44,165
<i>Go, you fool.</i>
<i>Super star is in our soul.</i>

1140
01:16:52,908 --> 01:16:57,106
<i>He's like a Gandhi</i>
<i>with weapons in hand</i>

1141
01:16:57,245 --> 01:17:01,648
<i>A sculptor who carefully</i>
<i>carves our head</i>

1142
01:17:01,883 --> 01:17:05,979
<i>Men folk visit him to get beautified</i>

1143
01:17:06,188 --> 01:17:09,885
<i>He has become a priest to the men folk.</i>

1144
01:17:09,992 --> 01:17:14,156
<i>He has learnt this Art</i>
<i>in no school or college.</i>

1145
01:17:14,262 --> 01:17:18,699
<i>He had learnt this Art</i>
<i>from other world and heaven.</i>

1146
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:22,896
<i>Who is Barber?</i>
<i>He is a virtuous person.</i>

1147
01:17:23,038 --> 01:17:27,407
<i>We have got him as a man of fortune</i>

1148
01:17:32,381 --> 01:17:36,647
<i>Come Ramaiya brother!</i>
<i>Do you know Super star?</i>

1149
01:17:36,752 --> 01:17:41,121
<i>Go, you fool.</i>
<i>Super star is in our soul.</i>

1150
01:17:41,223 --> 01:17:45,421
<i>If earthquake comes as a man,</i>
<i>it's only Super star.</i>

1151
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:49,860
<i>Super star is elder brother</i>
<i>to all the brothers.</i>

1152
01:17:49,965 --> 01:17:54,197
<i>There is only one name</i>
<i>from everything</i>

1153
01:17:54,302 --> 01:17:58,261
<i>That is our 'Super star'</i>

1154
01:17:58,407 --> 01:18:02,241
<i>With Super star...</i>

1155
01:18:02,811 --> 01:18:08,443
<i>The one who played games in childhood</i>
<i>is our Bumper star Balu!</i>

1156
01:18:44,853 --> 01:18:48,880
- What is it sister? - I was longing
to give you some nice dishes

1157
01:18:49,224 --> 01:18:50,953
That's why I've brought this
mutton biryani for you

1158
01:18:51,226 --> 01:18:53,285
I'll send chicken and fish fry tonight

1159
01:18:53,428 --> 01:18:56,556
- You and your children may relish it
- This has lots of meat pieces

1160
01:18:57,766 --> 01:18:59,631
No sister.
I don't eat all this

1161
01:18:59,735 --> 01:19:02,169
No need for you to eat.
Let Balu and children have them

1162
01:19:02,370 --> 01:19:04,998
This is surprising.
You're staying close by

1163
01:19:05,107 --> 01:19:07,098
But you've never shared food
for Bakrid and Ramzan

1164
01:19:07,275 --> 01:19:10,472
- Suddenly, why all this?
- Flattery!

1165
01:19:10,612 --> 01:19:11,704
This is nothing else

1166
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:14,371
It seems your hubby and
Ashokkumar were childhood friends

1167
01:19:14,516 --> 01:19:16,848
If she does all this
you would tell your hubby

1168
01:19:16,985 --> 01:19:19,283
Then your hubby would take my wife
and daughter to shooting spot

1169
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:21,355
- Hence she's trying to persuade
- Ignore him.

1170
01:19:21,490 --> 01:19:24,357
He is jobless
Here, you take this

1171
01:19:24,593 --> 01:19:29,360
No sister. My kids are not used
to eating chicken, biryany

1172
01:19:29,531 --> 01:19:32,898
If they taste this today
they would crave for it everyday

1173
01:19:33,001 --> 01:19:35,026
And I won't be able to provide them
I can prepare and give whenever you like

1174
01:19:35,170 --> 01:19:37,104
Superstar is going to
stay here only for 30 days

1175
01:19:37,272 --> 01:19:40,537
After shooting he'll go back
and you'll mind your work

1176
01:19:40,709 --> 01:19:42,404
Then, you won't drop in here even once

1177
01:19:43,645 --> 01:19:46,614
No sister.
Please take these back.

1178
01:19:48,784 --> 01:19:50,615
All because of my hubby

1179
01:19:54,189 --> 01:19:56,657
- Hey, stop it!
- Stop it!

1180
01:19:56,958 --> 01:19:58,892
- Get down!
- Give a hand. Come

1181
01:19:59,127 --> 01:20:01,755
Be careful with the chair

1182
01:20:03,131 --> 01:20:05,031
Come on. Be careful
Take it inside

1183
01:20:06,034 --> 01:20:09,094
What is all this?
My chair

1184
01:20:09,204 --> 01:20:11,172
I've brought you a chair from Japan

1185
01:20:11,339 --> 01:20:14,467
Bring the chair in Bring it
Keep it here

1186
01:20:14,676 --> 01:20:19,010
He got up at 4 'o clock early morning
to get this chair for you

1187
01:20:19,147 --> 01:20:21,172
- Yes brother
- This is a revolving chair

1188
01:20:21,416 --> 01:20:25,876
Your fortune will also change
I spent 15000 rupees for this

1189
01:20:25,987 --> 01:20:28,956
You don't have to worry for 100 years

1190
01:20:29,124 --> 01:20:32,582
You, your children and their lineage
can enjoy with the same trade

1191
01:20:32,727 --> 01:20:33,921
Did I ask you for this chair?
Why all this?

1192
01:20:34,062 --> 01:20:36,030
Should I know only if you tell me?

1193
01:20:36,331 --> 01:20:39,858
- What to do with this chair?
- Throw it away. It's worthless

1194
01:20:39,968 --> 01:20:43,870
Oh Lord!

1195
01:20:45,006 --> 01:20:47,474
- Sit! Sit down!
- That's it

1196
01:20:47,642 --> 01:20:49,200
This chair is yours now

1197
01:20:49,344 --> 01:20:51,539
The revolving chair which
you were aspiring for long

1198
01:20:51,713 --> 01:20:55,547
Even if all of us sit together
it won't break

1199
01:20:55,684 --> 01:20:57,379
Give my chair

1200
01:21:00,255 --> 01:21:02,382
- Leave me
- Hold on

1201
01:21:02,591 --> 01:21:06,425
Look here, new scissors

1202
01:21:07,462 --> 01:21:12,024
New knife, powder tin

1203
01:21:14,035 --> 01:21:17,471
- Do the first service to me
- I won't

1204
01:21:17,606 --> 01:21:18,402
I want my chair

1205
01:21:18,506 --> 01:21:20,440
Let the opening ceremony be done
by doing a shave for me

1206
01:21:20,909 --> 01:21:23,139
Return back my chair
Bring it

1207
01:21:23,345 --> 01:21:24,403
Why do you say like this?

1208
01:21:24,512 --> 01:21:29,472
If not, pay for all these in instalments
No need to pay interest

1209
01:21:29,618 --> 01:21:31,779
This is the eighth wonder

1210
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:34,548
- Want to see the ninth wonder?
- What? Oh no!

1211
01:21:35,056 --> 01:21:36,751
Wait. What is all this?
I don't understand

1212
01:21:36,925 --> 01:21:39,985
Come, I'll tell you
It's very simple

1213
01:21:40,295 --> 01:21:44,254
- Introduce me to the Super Star, enough.
- It's impossible.

1214
01:21:44,699 --> 01:21:46,257
Why do you say so?
What happened?

1215
01:21:46,601 --> 01:21:48,159
No need to take me now itself

1216
01:21:48,303 --> 01:21:53,070
May be tomorrow or
day after or a week later

1217
01:21:53,208 --> 01:21:56,507
That's it. Have it in mind
Get the vehicle

1218
01:21:56,711 --> 01:22:01,512
- Long live Balu!
- Long live!

1219
01:22:01,716 --> 01:22:05,618
Somehow I should make a movie
with Super star with this Balu's help

1220
01:22:07,322 --> 01:22:12,419
Did you meet Super Star? Did you
tell him about our school function?

1221
01:22:12,661 --> 01:22:15,994
Because you didn't revert
we have arranged for this meeting

1222
01:22:16,131 --> 01:22:18,395
We heard that he is going to
stay here for 20 more days only

1223
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:19,794
What are you going to do now?

1224
01:22:20,435 --> 01:22:22,801
Why aren't you keeping quiet?

1225
01:22:23,138 --> 01:22:25,231
Couldn't you get anyone else?

1226
01:22:26,074 --> 01:22:28,804
You want an actor to preside over
our school function

1227
01:22:29,010 --> 01:22:29,942
Whom do we call then?

1228
01:22:30,078 --> 01:22:35,038
You can call the Collector or Tahsildar
or someone connected to studies

1229
01:22:35,216 --> 01:22:37,776
Call a great scientist like Abdul Kalam

1230
01:22:38,086 --> 01:22:40,953
But you want an actor to preside.
Aren't you ashamed?

1231
01:22:41,089 --> 01:22:42,681
We know well
whom to call for what

1232
01:22:43,224 --> 01:22:47,160
We told the students only after you and
your wife confirmed that he would come

1233
01:22:47,329 --> 01:22:49,024
Don't shatter their dreams

1234
01:22:49,264 --> 01:22:50,663
Will you bring him or not?

1235
01:22:50,932 --> 01:22:52,490
- Tell us
- Tell us sir

1236
01:22:53,101 --> 01:22:54,068
Please tell us.

1237
01:22:54,169 --> 01:23:03,339
We're asking you
Please tell us

1238
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:14,880
Don't shout.
Listen to us.

1239
01:23:14,956 --> 01:23:17,686
- Go back.
- Move away.

1240
01:23:17,859 --> 01:23:22,762
Don't know how I am going to meet him
amidst this crowd and cops

1241
01:23:23,198 --> 01:23:27,066
- Oh God! - Shooting is going on inside
Be quiet all of you

1242
01:23:27,235 --> 01:23:29,635
If you shout
I'll thrash you all

1243
01:23:37,645 --> 01:23:41,137
<i>Come on!</i>

1244
01:23:43,351 --> 01:23:47,378
<i>Come on!</i>

1245
01:24:16,017 --> 01:24:17,348
Who is it?

1246
01:25:29,524 --> 01:25:32,152
No one can destroy this Vettayan

1247
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:34,988
Still if they intend,
I will destroy them

1248
01:25:57,051 --> 01:25:58,279
Sit.

1249
01:26:03,191 --> 01:26:04,624
Control them.

1250
01:26:23,444 --> 01:26:26,743
- Where can I see CTA Abishek?
- He is inside. Go and see.

1251
01:26:31,719 --> 01:26:33,983
Baskar! Have you cut the yam!

1252
01:26:35,890 --> 01:26:38,120
- Where is Masthan?
- He went out taking water can.

1253
01:26:38,293 --> 01:26:43,492
Idiot! If we cook well and serve to them,
They'll take a good film.

1254
01:26:43,665 --> 01:26:45,496
- Lf not, we won't get work here.
- You are right.

1255
01:26:48,036 --> 01:26:49,298
Come here.

1256
01:26:50,605 --> 01:26:51,765
He's a barber, isn't it?

1257
01:26:52,273 --> 01:26:53,535
Manage him carefully.

1258
01:26:54,542 --> 01:26:56,533
- Why have you come here?
- I thought you were a financier.

1259
01:26:56,678 --> 01:26:57,872
What do you want?

1260
01:26:58,713 --> 01:27:02,843
Super Star and I were friends
25 years ago. We were school mates.

1261
01:27:03,017 --> 01:27:03,984
Is it?

1262
01:27:05,453 --> 01:27:09,253
- What brother? - He says that
he is friend of Ashok Kumar.

1263
01:27:09,357 --> 01:27:11,154
Come all of you.
Let's hear what he says.

1264
01:27:11,893 --> 01:27:14,225
Sit in this drum.
The sambar is so hot.

1265
01:27:14,896 --> 01:27:17,194
Ok, sit here.
Come.

1266
01:27:17,832 --> 01:27:19,356
Somehow I want to meet him.

1267
01:27:19,834 --> 01:27:21,324
It's very simple.

1268
01:27:21,603 --> 01:27:26,131
If anybody seeks money from him,
he'll give money full of his hands.

1269
01:27:26,241 --> 01:27:28,903
If he knows the person,
he'll give him bags of money.

1270
01:27:29,944 --> 01:27:33,436
Do you know Super star friend's job?
Haircutting.

1271
01:27:34,349 --> 01:27:36,112
Look! How Super star friend is.

1272
01:27:36,284 --> 01:27:37,979
If he is a bus driver,
we can trust him.

1273
01:27:38,086 --> 01:27:39,519
He says that he is a barber.

1274
01:27:39,621 --> 01:27:42,055
He wants to meet Super star
and renew his friendship

1275
01:27:42,156 --> 01:27:45,091
He wants to hug him. He wants
to scoop whatever he gets as charity

1276
01:27:45,226 --> 01:27:46,090
Go away.

1277
01:27:48,062 --> 01:27:49,893
Even in outdoor shooting spots
he is not left peaceful

1278
01:27:50,064 --> 01:27:51,793
How should Super star friends look like?

1279
01:27:51,899 --> 01:27:55,892
No doctor, judge, IAS or IPS
comes claiming old friendship

1280
01:27:56,004 --> 01:28:01,408
Only guys like barber, gamblers,
painters or drunkards come

1281
01:28:01,509 --> 01:28:06,378
Try some other means to make money.
Don't approach Super Star.

1282
01:28:13,121 --> 01:28:14,884
Instead of being in the shop,
what are you doing here?

1283
01:28:14,989 --> 01:28:16,923
We are looking at the shooting vehicle.

1284
01:28:17,659 --> 01:28:18,648
Sir! Is milk ready?

1285
01:28:19,160 --> 01:28:21,924
Boss, this is shooting vehicle.
This is going to the guest house

1286
01:28:22,030 --> 01:28:25,329
If you board this,
you can meet Super star.

1287
01:28:27,135 --> 01:28:28,227
Give it

1288
01:28:29,437 --> 01:28:33,999
- Take care boss!
- Bye. - Hold it tight.

1289
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:41,145
Everyone gets on to
the city bus or a town bus...

1290
01:28:41,249 --> 01:28:42,739
But I've got on
to a cinema bus.

1291
01:28:43,318 --> 01:28:44,910
I have to get his permission at noon...

1292
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:46,680
And take a photo with him before evening.

1293
01:28:47,121 --> 01:28:48,588
I'll close the door at night.

1294
01:28:55,730 --> 01:28:56,822
How could I get down?

1295
01:29:02,837 --> 01:29:06,466
I'll use this rope like
Spider man and Super man.

1296
01:29:06,741 --> 01:29:08,675
I should meet him at present.

1297
01:29:19,187 --> 01:29:20,950
Oh God! No one is here.

1298
01:30:07,902 --> 01:30:09,733
Don't know where is Super star and
when will I meet him?

1299
01:30:11,406 --> 01:30:12,964
I think it's shooting.
Here goes the lights!

1300
01:30:13,641 --> 01:30:15,609
Everyone is leaving after shooting!
How can I go to shooting spot?

1301
01:30:15,710 --> 01:30:16,802
Somebody is watching me.

1302
01:30:18,212 --> 01:30:19,110
No one look at me.

1303
01:30:20,748 --> 01:30:21,544
Thank God!

1304
01:30:28,055 --> 01:30:29,317
Sir! If you get your permission...

1305
01:30:29,557 --> 01:30:31,525
I would take a photograph
with him and my wife

1306
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:41,024
I've reached the location.

1307
01:30:42,537 --> 01:30:45,665
Oh God! If I see Super star
when I open my eyes...

1308
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:47,501
My wife and me will take
a photograph with him.

1309
01:30:47,742 --> 01:30:50,404
Seeing it everyone in this
village will feel envy.

1310
01:30:51,078 --> 01:30:52,545
What is it?

1311
01:30:52,713 --> 01:30:54,977
They have arranged a market set
like us in the shooting spot. - Boss.

1312
01:30:55,183 --> 01:30:56,878
When did you come to the shooting spot?

1313
01:30:57,018 --> 01:30:59,680
- We didn't. You came here yourself.
- What do you mean?

1314
01:31:04,192 --> 01:31:08,526
How could you drop me here
from where I got in?

1315
01:31:08,863 --> 01:31:12,390
Even auto drivers haven't
dropped me at my shop correctly.

1316
01:31:12,533 --> 01:31:16,299
You've wasted an opportunity
My all ideas are wasted.

1317
01:31:16,504 --> 01:31:18,802
It might have missed
but you won't miss it.

1318
01:31:19,373 --> 01:31:22,365
Why have you become ill suddenly?

1319
01:31:22,510 --> 01:31:25,240
Will illness come with prior notice?

1320
01:31:25,346 --> 01:31:27,610
- Oh God! - Shall we
consult a doctor? - No need

1321
01:31:27,748 --> 01:31:32,242
Illness in my body knows our capacity
It will go on its own

1322
01:31:32,453 --> 01:31:35,251
Have this saridon tablet atleast.
Your headache will subside.

1323
01:31:35,456 --> 01:31:37,822
Devi, will you do something?

1324
01:31:37,959 --> 01:31:40,860
Have I ever refused?
Tell me what you want

1325
01:31:41,162 --> 01:31:44,290
Shall we go and hide somewhere
until they complete their shooting?

1326
01:31:45,666 --> 01:31:47,998
What about our goat and hens?

1327
01:31:48,135 --> 01:31:50,729
We'll get it from
somewhere else and cook

1328
01:31:51,572 --> 01:31:56,236
Not for that. Somehow we should
return here after they go

1329
01:31:56,444 --> 01:31:58,139
We've to face the same neighbourhood

1330
01:31:59,380 --> 01:32:02,941
I've boasted a lot about your friendship

1331
01:32:03,851 --> 01:32:05,944
I feel worried about that

1332
01:32:09,257 --> 01:32:10,815
All vehicles have returned due
to rains except heroine's vehicle.

1333
01:32:10,925 --> 01:32:13,120
- Did you call the make-up man?
- His phone is switched off.

1334
01:32:13,261 --> 01:32:14,558
Then, call the touchup boy.

1335
01:32:14,896 --> 01:32:16,761
- Why have they worried?
- Nothing sir.

1336
01:32:16,898 --> 01:32:19,196
Everyone has returned from
the location except heroine.

1337
01:32:40,354 --> 01:32:44,757
<i>Rain touches my body warmly.</i>

1338
01:32:48,663 --> 01:32:53,123
<i>Silver rain incites me</i>

1339
01:32:57,371 --> 01:33:04,834
<i>My body shivers in this rain.</i>

1340
01:33:05,379 --> 01:33:08,542
<i>It sprinkles... it sprinkles...</i>

1341
01:33:09,550 --> 01:33:13,350
<i>It drizzles... Rain drizzles...</i>

1342
01:33:13,788 --> 01:33:17,019
<i>It sprinkles... it sprinkles...</i>

1343
01:33:17,992 --> 01:33:21,018
<i>It drizzles... Rain drizzles...</i>

1344
01:33:22,096 --> 01:33:26,556
<i>Rain touches my body warmly.</i>

1345
01:33:30,605 --> 01:33:35,167
<i>Silver rain incites me</i>

1346
01:34:06,140 --> 01:34:10,201
<i>Peacock dances in the rain with joy.</i>

1347
01:34:10,344 --> 01:34:14,405
<i>Is it a wrong if we drench in the rain?</i>

1348
01:34:14,548 --> 01:34:18,609
<i>There is no need service tax for rain.</i>

1349
01:34:18,753 --> 01:34:22,849
<i>The rain drops fall like a cinema reel.</i>

1350
01:34:22,957 --> 01:34:24,948
<i>Frist rain drops cooling is so great.</i>

1351
01:34:25,059 --> 01:34:27,027
<i>Budding youth is so great.</i>

1352
01:34:27,128 --> 01:34:30,757
<i>Is it a wrong when we play in the rain?</i>

1353
01:34:30,865 --> 01:34:33,299
<i>Paper boats are used in the rain</i>

1354
01:34:33,401 --> 01:34:35,426
<i>Umbrellas are too used in the rain.</i>

1355
01:34:35,536 --> 01:34:39,563
<i>Is it a wrong let's sing in the rain?</i>

1356
01:34:39,674 --> 01:34:43,701
<i>Rainbow appears in the rain.</i>

1357
01:34:43,844 --> 01:34:46,938
<i>Youth looks for company in the rain.</i>

1358
01:34:48,082 --> 01:34:51,313
<i>It sprinkles... it sprinkles...</i>

1359
01:34:52,186 --> 01:34:55,280
<i>It drizzles... Rain drizzles...</i>

1360
01:35:23,684 --> 01:35:27,620
<i>Continuous wind blow,</i>
<i>prompts rain shower.</i>

1361
01:35:27,822 --> 01:35:31,986
<i>Thunder sparks the eyes in the rain.</i>

1362
01:35:32,093 --> 01:35:35,893
<i>Rain drops make the earth dance!</i>

1363
01:35:36,197 --> 01:35:40,361
<i>Blushing silver Moon appears in the rain.</i>

1364
01:35:40,468 --> 01:35:44,495
<i>Rain drops give warm feeling to the body.</i>

1365
01:35:44,605 --> 01:35:48,735
<i>It is a shower of affection!</i>
<i>Enjoy it.</i>

1366
01:35:48,843 --> 01:35:50,811
<i>Even the waist is unable</i>
<i>to stand erect.</i>

1367
01:35:50,911 --> 01:35:52,936
<i>It crosses bounds beyond the limits.</i>

1368
01:35:53,047 --> 01:35:57,074
<i>Youth shivers in haste.</i>

1369
01:35:57,218 --> 01:36:01,177
<i>The dark clouds give glances.</i>

1370
01:36:01,322 --> 01:36:04,348
<i>Amazing sounds of harp</i>
<i>evolve in the rain.</i>

1371
01:36:05,526 --> 01:36:08,757
<i>It sprinkles... it sprinkles...</i>

1372
01:36:09,697 --> 01:36:13,394
<i>It drizzles... Rain drizzles...</i>

1373
01:36:13,934 --> 01:36:17,233
<i>It sprinkles... it sprinkles...</i>

1374
01:36:18,172 --> 01:36:21,198
<i>It drizzles... Rain drizzles...</i>

1375
01:36:28,249 --> 01:36:32,083
- Stop there.
- Balu! Get him.

1376
01:36:34,522 --> 01:36:35,921
Have you seen the super star?
Did you tell him about me?

1377
01:36:36,123 --> 01:36:37,420
When has he said
he would collect the advance?

1378
01:36:37,625 --> 01:36:40,355
I wanted to see you in person!
You are here before me.

1379
01:36:40,628 --> 01:36:42,687
Did you tell about me to him?

1380
01:36:42,930 --> 01:36:45,865
I've sold my daughter's ear rings
and got the money to give to you.

1381
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,399
I get enough income from my saloon.

1382
01:36:47,501 --> 01:36:49,401
I shall give the money
for the chair in due course.

1383
01:36:49,603 --> 01:36:51,594
I am not talking about the money.

1384
01:36:51,739 --> 01:36:53,798
- That sheet! What sheet is that?
- Call sheet boss!

1385
01:36:54,008 --> 01:36:55,134
When will you get the sheet from him?

1386
01:36:55,309 --> 01:36:56,708
You take this money.

1387
01:36:57,011 --> 01:36:58,239
Why do you talk to him?

1388
01:36:58,379 --> 01:36:59,505
Let's go and meet him.

1389
01:36:59,613 --> 01:37:00,875
Let's get him on the jeep.

1390
01:37:00,981 --> 01:37:02,278
We'll tell story to him
and get his permission.

1391
01:37:02,416 --> 01:37:05,112
Make him get on the jeep.
Catch him.

1392
01:37:05,252 --> 01:37:06,844
- Listen to me.
- Stop. Shouldn't I get in?

1393
01:37:07,421 --> 01:37:09,787
I'll run over you by the jeep.
Mind it.

1394
01:37:09,890 --> 01:37:11,084
Excuse me sit.
It was by mistaken.

1395
01:37:11,192 --> 01:37:14,787
- Get in. - You should
think a bit about us.

1396
01:37:14,929 --> 01:37:18,456
- Start the jeep.
- Don't waste time. Go.

1397
01:37:20,301 --> 01:37:21,996
Master calls you
to watch the rehearsal.

1398
01:37:23,170 --> 01:37:25,161
I am a real fighter in our place.

1399
01:37:25,306 --> 01:37:26,864
I am not a duplicate as your master.

1400
01:37:26,974 --> 01:37:29,272
Ask me to do the fighting
when I reach there. I'll do.

1401
01:37:29,410 --> 01:37:31,605
It is the fight scene
where 20 men beat you.

1402
01:37:32,646 --> 01:37:36,810
Ask your master to instruct
those 20 men to be careful

1403
01:37:37,451 --> 01:37:40,147
- Move away.
- Dharmaraju boss has come.

1404
01:37:40,254 --> 01:37:42,154
- Stop it.
- Get down Sir.

1405
01:37:42,256 --> 01:37:45,282
- Get down Balu.
- Move aside.

1406
01:37:45,826 --> 01:37:48,294
Dharmaraju has come.
Move aside.

1407
01:37:48,429 --> 01:37:50,522
Can't you understand
what I told? Go away.

1408
01:37:53,234 --> 01:37:54,792
Day by day the mob is increasing.

1409
01:37:54,902 --> 01:37:56,392
Karmaraju has come sir.

1410
01:37:57,738 --> 01:38:00,639
I am Dharmaraju but not Karmaraju.

1411
01:38:00,741 --> 01:38:02,436
- We can correct it on dubbing.
- What?

1412
01:38:02,743 --> 01:38:04,142
No dubbing here.
Go away.

1413
01:38:05,646 --> 01:38:07,739
Balu come here.
Do you know who he is.

1414
01:38:07,848 --> 01:38:08,974
- Do you know him?
- Who is he?

1415
01:38:09,350 --> 01:38:10,783
- Greetings sir.
- He is Barber Balu.

1416
01:38:10,885 --> 01:38:12,580
Super star and he is very close friends.

1417
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:14,347
He and we are very close.

1418
01:38:14,889 --> 01:38:15,685
Oh God!

1419
01:38:15,789 --> 01:38:18,155
He wants to meet him.
Please untie it.

1420
01:38:18,259 --> 01:38:19,351
Did the super star ask you to come?

1421
01:38:19,460 --> 01:38:21,655
He didn't.
We want to go to meet him.

1422
01:38:22,663 --> 01:38:25,996
It's their duty
Let us mind our own business.

1423
01:38:27,301 --> 01:38:28,359
I can't go inside from main entrance.

1424
01:38:28,469 --> 01:38:29,265
I'll try from side entrance.

1425
01:38:29,370 --> 01:38:32,635
You are insulting Super star's
future film director and producer.

1426
01:38:32,740 --> 01:38:35,140
If we worry,
Telugu people will miss good movie.

1427
01:38:35,242 --> 01:38:38,336
Won't you untie the ropes?
Should we cut the ropes?

1428
01:38:38,779 --> 01:38:41,247
- Shut up. I'll kill you
- Why do you talk with him? - What?

1429
01:38:41,348 --> 01:38:43,612
Why do you worry
when Balu is with us?

1430
01:38:45,386 --> 01:38:46,353
Oh God, he is missing.

1431
01:38:48,622 --> 01:38:49,884
Move on

1432
01:38:51,191 --> 01:38:52,886
Run away.

1433
01:38:54,895 --> 01:38:56,522
- Somehow I have reached.
- Go away.

1434
01:38:57,798 --> 01:38:59,823
Why should I get into that tussle?

1435
01:39:00,701 --> 01:39:01,963
I'll go unnoticed with
my green dress on grass.

1436
01:39:07,408 --> 01:39:09,638
- Wear the costumes.
Shot is ready -I'll come.

1437
01:39:09,743 --> 01:39:10,869
The hero will come now.

1438
01:39:10,978 --> 01:39:12,673
Go away, will you?

1439
01:39:12,780 --> 01:39:13,906
Keep it there and come.

1440
01:39:17,818 --> 01:39:19,809
Till now I went for looseness 12 times.

1441
01:39:19,987 --> 01:39:22,956
I couldn't tell this in open.

1442
01:39:28,062 --> 01:39:30,530
It's a movie costume. I will change
into this and meet Super star

1443
01:39:38,605 --> 01:39:40,903
He is the one who told the Asst. Director
that you are a duplicate.

1444
01:39:41,375 --> 01:39:45,744
Did he? Fighters! Hit him
for real in the fight scene.

1445
01:39:47,281 --> 01:39:51,479
Same dress! If I join them
I can meet the Super star!

1446
01:39:52,820 --> 01:39:54,014
Sir! Aren't you the new artiste?

1447
01:39:55,389 --> 01:39:56,754
Master is waiting for you!

1448
01:39:58,125 --> 01:39:58,989
Let's go

1449
01:40:01,261 --> 01:40:05,823
- Let us test -Is it like
a urine or a blood test?

1450
01:40:06,133 --> 01:40:09,102
Have you been working in a lab?
Oh gosh!

1451
01:40:11,405 --> 01:40:13,805
If he comes to our shop,
I'll tonsure him.

1452
01:40:19,113 --> 01:40:20,045
Enough

1453
01:40:23,217 --> 01:40:25,549
Why do you hit me?

1454
01:40:27,521 --> 01:40:29,386
Why do you circle me?

1455
01:40:41,969 --> 01:40:44,631
Where are you sending me?

1456
01:40:46,640 --> 01:40:48,767
- Save me. - He has gone
to our master! Get him.

1457
01:40:48,876 --> 01:40:50,867
They're trying to kill me.
Save me

1458
01:40:51,345 --> 01:40:54,075
- Catch him
- Never mind

1459
01:40:56,250 --> 01:40:59,515
I have seen him at last.
I am speaking with him.

1460
01:40:59,620 --> 01:41:01,212
I have touched you!

1461
01:41:01,321 --> 01:41:04,347
Is it you?
Is this true?

1462
01:41:04,525 --> 01:41:07,494
I can't believe myself.
For once...

1463
01:41:08,929 --> 01:41:11,864
The same hair, nose.
The same style.

1464
01:41:13,700 --> 01:41:17,500
I suffered extreme distress and
acute physical pain to come to you.

1465
01:41:17,738 --> 01:41:20,502
After seeing you,
I've got a strange strength.

1466
01:41:20,707 --> 01:41:22,299
What do you want 'Nanna' (dear)?

1467
01:41:22,409 --> 01:41:24,843
That's not my name.
I am Cutting Kantharao.

1468
01:41:24,945 --> 01:41:27,573
- Ok, Rao...
- Please call by my full name

1469
01:41:27,681 --> 01:41:30,275
- Kantharao! - Tell my full name
with my shop's name.

1470
01:41:30,384 --> 01:41:32,215
Cutting Kantharao.

1471
01:41:33,187 --> 01:41:34,085
What do you want?

1472
01:41:34,188 --> 01:41:39,216
My wife wants to take a photograph with
you to maintain harmony in our life.

1473
01:41:40,160 --> 01:41:44,358
The photo issue is a
big hurdle in my family life.

1474
01:41:44,465 --> 01:41:47,992
I will be happy if you agree for that.

1475
01:41:48,102 --> 01:41:52,698
...Where is your wife?
- Wife!

1476
01:41:53,173 --> 01:41:54,765
- Oops! Pipe.
- Don't worry.

1477
01:41:54,875 --> 01:41:57,776
Mohan Rao! Fetch his wife and
the still camera along with. - Enough. Ok.

1478
01:41:57,878 --> 01:42:04,181
How dare you could go into the guest
house in spite of all the security?

1479
01:42:04,351 --> 01:42:06,182
Don't you know about Police kicks?

1480
01:42:06,854 --> 01:42:10,449
We know about biers
but not about police kicks.

1481
01:42:10,757 --> 01:42:11,746
You fool! What are you telling?

1482
01:42:11,859 --> 01:42:13,417
He has been blabbering!

1483
01:42:14,962 --> 01:42:16,657
He is a rich man in our place.

1484
01:42:16,763 --> 01:42:19,163
If you harass him and lock him inside
it is equivalent to punishing us.

1485
01:42:19,266 --> 01:42:23,066
He ditched us in the road
But you're ditching me here

1486
01:42:23,837 --> 01:42:25,998
Balu the owner of a saloon
in our village...

1487
01:42:26,140 --> 01:42:28,938
...told me that the super star
is his friend...

1488
01:42:29,042 --> 01:42:31,101
...and he would get the sheet from him.

1489
01:42:31,211 --> 01:42:34,738
- What sheet is that?
- It is the call sheet, boss.

1490
01:42:34,915 --> 01:42:36,780
All this fuss is only because of that

1491
01:42:36,884 --> 01:42:41,912
Where is the friend of Ashok Kumar?

1492
01:42:42,890 --> 01:42:48,021
Has Ashokkumar ever
cut his hair in his shop?

1493
01:42:48,162 --> 01:42:49,959
Or has he gone to his house to dine?

1494
01:42:50,063 --> 01:42:53,692
Until there are fools like you
there'll be cheats

1495
01:42:53,800 --> 01:42:56,268
Try to be alert hereafter.
Got it?

1496
01:42:56,370 --> 01:42:57,234
Go away.

1497
01:42:58,305 --> 01:42:59,101
See you sir.

1498
01:43:03,744 --> 01:43:07,646
Balu, come out.

1499
01:43:07,748 --> 01:43:12,617
You cheat! Come out.

1500
01:43:13,954 --> 01:43:17,253
Look at this all of you.

1501
01:43:17,424 --> 01:43:21,019
I saw him and spoke with him

1502
01:43:21,128 --> 01:43:22,789
I touched him

1503
01:43:23,830 --> 01:43:26,799
All of you, look at our photo
with the super star.

1504
01:43:27,267 --> 01:43:31,294
Look at this all of you

1505
01:43:38,245 --> 01:43:42,875
Wastrels can see it.
I've taken a photo with Super star.

1506
01:43:43,016 --> 01:43:47,419
It is no big deal just claiming
Super star as a close friend

1507
01:43:47,521 --> 01:43:49,921
Don't just speak, show it in action

1508
01:43:50,857 --> 01:43:54,486
I only set right his hair for the photo

1509
01:43:54,761 --> 01:43:57,093
I'll make a 6ft blow up of this photo...

1510
01:43:57,197 --> 01:44:02,499
...keep it in my shop
and develop my business

1511
01:44:04,004 --> 01:44:05,869
Your misfortune is
sitting on your back

1512
01:44:05,973 --> 01:44:09,909
He is only his fan but he managed
to take his photograph with him.

1513
01:44:10,010 --> 01:44:12,501
But you have cheated us,
telling us you are his friend.

1514
01:44:12,713 --> 01:44:16,843
- Bring everything from inside.
- We will, boss. - Bring it

1515
01:44:17,284 --> 01:44:19,946
Have you escaped
when the police caught us?

1516
01:44:20,120 --> 01:44:22,748
Had you been the real friend
you would have spoken to him

1517
01:44:22,889 --> 01:44:25,687
- Why didn't you do that?
Load it all in the jeep. - Watch out.

1518
01:44:25,792 --> 01:44:27,851
Are you a friend that
you're betraying me?

1519
01:44:34,935 --> 01:44:35,902
Instead of depending on this Balu...

1520
01:44:36,003 --> 01:44:38,198
...if we had persuaded Kantharao, we would
have been doing the shooting now

1521
01:44:39,706 --> 01:44:43,073
Whether he is good or bad,
he tried and managed to attain it.

1522
01:44:43,510 --> 01:44:46,240
You never tried
hence didn't attain results

1523
01:44:46,380 --> 01:44:48,575
You should try hard
for anything. You do it Balu!

1524
01:45:15,509 --> 01:45:16,498
What? You look tense.

1525
01:45:16,710 --> 01:45:20,146
Has Boss taken back
the new chair he gave you?

1526
01:45:20,981 --> 01:45:23,506
Fathima at next door made fun of us.

1527
01:45:23,617 --> 01:45:24,879
How did she know?

1528
01:45:26,153 --> 01:45:27,313
Her husband has told her.

1529
01:45:27,654 --> 01:45:31,420
- She came here and made fun of me!
- What did she say?

1530
01:45:31,625 --> 01:45:34,389
She said it was their fortune that
we didn't receive the biriyani she gave.

1531
01:45:34,695 --> 01:45:37,858
Or else, they would have been
our victims like others.

1532
01:45:38,065 --> 01:45:39,589
I felt very bad after hearing it.

1533
01:45:42,002 --> 01:45:43,970
You are suffering for the
only reason for loving me.

1534
01:45:46,606 --> 01:45:47,971
You are being belittled by others.

1535
01:45:48,875 --> 01:45:50,206
You're insulted
because of me.

1536
01:45:53,480 --> 01:45:55,277
You were born in a noble family.

1537
01:45:56,183 --> 01:45:58,208
You should have been happier
if you had not married me.

1538
01:45:58,485 --> 01:45:59,850
I am happy since the day
I got married to you.

1539
01:46:00,354 --> 01:46:06,554
Henceforth also it'll be like that.

1540
01:46:07,294 --> 01:46:10,388
My love for you won't
reduce for any reason.

1541
01:46:10,731 --> 01:46:12,858
Because I told you
that Super star was my friend...

1542
01:46:13,734 --> 01:46:15,031
...all of you were insulted.

1543
01:46:16,703 --> 01:46:18,261
How can I go to that market place?

1544
01:46:19,306 --> 01:46:20,933
How will I face others?

1545
01:46:22,642 --> 01:46:23,973
I won't go to the shop anymore

1546
01:46:25,112 --> 01:46:26,272
What are you saying?

1547
01:46:26,546 --> 01:46:28,104
They have broken the remaining chair too.

1548
01:46:29,116 --> 01:46:32,745
- What will I do going there?
- Don't worry.

1549
01:46:33,320 --> 01:46:34,651
Go to the market and open our shop.

1550
01:46:34,921 --> 01:46:37,321
We will sell all our hens and goats

1551
01:46:38,225 --> 01:46:40,853
If required I'll sell my jewels and
we'll buy a new chair.

1552
01:46:41,528 --> 01:46:44,053
- Ok -People give money
against property or jewels or animals

1553
01:46:45,699 --> 01:46:48,099
But they hesitate to give me

1554
01:48:05,078 --> 01:48:06,136
In the last meeting Balu gave assurance...

1555
01:48:06,446 --> 01:48:10,815
...but still no news from him.

1556
01:48:11,318 --> 01:48:14,879
As a principal,
you could not take any decision.

1557
01:48:15,121 --> 01:48:16,554
The function is getting near.

1558
01:48:17,090 --> 01:48:18,648
Do you have anyone
as an alternative?

1559
01:48:18,959 --> 01:48:24,226
Even if they were old friends would a
great actor accept a barber's invitation?

1560
01:48:24,331 --> 01:48:25,525
We should have thought that

1561
01:48:25,632 --> 01:48:27,566
No use thinking about it now

1562
01:48:28,401 --> 01:48:30,801
Did anybody think it over
when I told you earlier?

1563
01:48:31,137 --> 01:48:33,697
No actors will remember
their old friends.

1564
01:48:34,207 --> 01:48:37,370
They would say no if at all he goes
and stands before him...

1565
01:48:37,511 --> 01:48:40,309
...and asks him if he remembers him.

1566
01:48:40,914 --> 01:48:43,439
After gaining power, comforts and fame...

1567
01:48:43,583 --> 01:48:46,143
...nobody would remember
his old friend.

1568
01:48:46,553 --> 01:48:49,351
You tell all this. Will you be able
to bring Ashok Kumar then?

1569
01:48:50,957 --> 01:48:54,586
- Why do you laugh? - Do you
expect a ready answer for that?

1570
01:48:54,895 --> 01:48:57,796
He will go back after the shooting
before we get an answer from you.

1571
01:48:58,164 --> 01:49:00,689
So, I have to maintain
the dignity of this school.

1572
01:49:01,501 --> 01:49:04,026
After all it is our school.
Ok! I know a minister.

1573
01:49:04,437 --> 01:49:07,702
I will tell him and make arrangements
to invite Ashok Kumar to this function.

1574
01:49:07,908 --> 01:49:08,806
Will he come if the minister invites him?

1575
01:49:09,075 --> 01:49:11,509
No actor would refuse to a minister.

1576
01:49:12,112 --> 01:49:17,015
If that is the case kindly get us
an appointment to meet him

1577
01:49:17,350 --> 01:49:19,910
It would be proper if we go to
invite him for our school meeting

1578
01:49:35,936 --> 01:49:37,733
What is this?
The time is six.

1579
01:49:38,104 --> 01:49:39,594
What are you three doing here
without getting home?

1580
01:49:39,806 --> 01:49:41,774
Friends are making fun of us at school.

1581
01:49:42,208 --> 01:49:44,073
It is all because of our dad.

1582
01:49:45,011 --> 01:49:47,138
I would have written the exam
for 10th by studying at home.

1583
01:49:47,581 --> 01:49:49,446
Why did you admit me in school again?

1584
01:49:49,983 --> 01:49:51,712
My friends make fun of us at school...

1585
01:49:52,152 --> 01:49:56,851
...that our dad knows the
super star well and not vice versa

1586
01:49:58,858 --> 01:50:01,418
Whatever it is, we'll talk it over
at our house. Come.

1587
01:50:03,730 --> 01:50:06,494
Why have you turned away
after seeing your dad?

1588
01:50:06,700 --> 01:50:07,792
Won't you talk to dad?

1589
01:50:08,034 --> 01:50:13,370
- He has lied. - He is a cheat.
- I don't like to see your face.

1590
01:50:32,792 --> 01:50:35,852
They've no other work.
Wastrels!

1591
01:50:37,230 --> 01:50:39,721
Brother, don't stop them
They have got permission

1592
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:40,967
You please come

1593
01:50:41,101 --> 01:50:43,228
Look, it is all because of
minister's phone call

1594
01:50:59,019 --> 01:51:00,077
Please come, sit down.

1595
01:51:01,921 --> 01:51:03,388
We are from St. George...

1596
01:51:03,590 --> 01:51:06,024
Minister informed me the
purpose of your visit. Sit down.

1597
01:51:06,760 --> 01:51:07,658
Come.

1598
01:51:09,295 --> 01:51:12,662
I am the principal.
He is Gopalakrishnan, PTA chairman.

1599
01:51:13,166 --> 01:51:16,499
He is Srinivasan,
Managing committee member

1600
01:51:18,471 --> 01:51:22,373
- Are they stuntmen?
- They're real black cat commandos

1601
01:51:25,679 --> 01:51:28,170
Minister might have told you
a lot about me

1602
01:51:28,715 --> 01:51:29,909
We both are close friends

1603
01:51:31,418 --> 01:51:32,851
- She is sister Maria
- Greetings sir

1604
01:51:33,319 --> 01:51:35,219
We feel honoured to meet you

1605
01:51:35,689 --> 01:51:38,214
- We are your great fans
- But I am not

1606
01:51:38,958 --> 01:51:41,085
Not only yours
but for anyone

1607
01:51:44,197 --> 01:51:46,722
Our school students are eager to see you

1608
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,867
Not just students, almost everyone
are eager to see you

1609
01:51:51,604 --> 01:51:54,072
Our shooting work would get
spoilt if we let public in

1610
01:51:54,374 --> 01:51:58,674
Moreover, shooting wouldn't be so
interesting to watch like movies

1611
01:51:59,045 --> 01:52:00,740
Yes, it would be boring

1612
01:52:01,047 --> 01:52:04,847
Minister and I had been to watch
Kamal Hassan's shooting once

1613
01:52:05,251 --> 01:52:09,881
Minister was shaking hands with
Kamal but I didn't like it

1614
01:52:10,323 --> 01:52:12,154
Why is that guy flaunting so much?

1615
01:52:12,659 --> 01:52:14,650
- I wanted to ask you too...
- Tell me

1616
01:52:15,729 --> 01:52:21,031
Why do you go to Himalayas
every 6 months like exile?

1617
01:52:21,201 --> 01:52:23,601
Is there no one to question you?

1618
01:52:23,970 --> 01:52:26,165
Or is there no happiness or peace here?

1619
01:52:28,007 --> 01:52:30,475
There is a difference between
peace and happiness

1620
01:52:31,010 --> 01:52:35,709
Happiness is temporary
but peace is permanent

1621
01:52:36,149 --> 01:52:39,141
We get peace in Himalayas
Noble ones have said that

1622
01:52:46,025 --> 01:52:48,084
When intelligence talks,
wisdom listens

1623
01:52:48,194 --> 01:52:49,752
I didn't mean me but them

1624
01:52:49,896 --> 01:52:50,794
Like to have coffee or tea?

1625
01:52:53,166 --> 01:52:56,363
- Tell me -I am not bothered
if you don't want to hear me

1626
01:52:56,536 --> 01:53:00,267
Aren't we here to talk about our school?
Let's restrict to that

1627
01:53:00,406 --> 01:53:02,601
Wait. I have a lot to ask him

1628
01:53:03,243 --> 01:53:06,041
Sometimes you say you'll enter politics.
At times you say you won't.

1629
01:53:06,312 --> 01:53:08,007
Or you say you'll come at the right time

1630
01:53:08,314 --> 01:53:09,975
or you say you don't know
about the future

1631
01:53:10,316 --> 01:53:12,375
If we ask further,
you point towards the sky

1632
01:53:12,886 --> 01:53:14,717
Why do you confuse yourselves
and confuse others?

1633
01:53:14,921 --> 01:53:16,980
Tell me clearly whether
you'll enter politics or not

1634
01:53:20,593 --> 01:53:24,154
Listen, I may enter politics or I may not
What is your botheration?

1635
01:53:24,364 --> 01:53:26,889
- You mind your work
- You must enter

1636
01:53:27,100 --> 01:53:30,558
Public want people
like you to become politicians

1637
01:53:30,970 --> 01:53:34,064
We want to see
what big things you can do

1638
01:53:34,607 --> 01:53:38,475
Don't know when will I come
or I will come at the right time

1639
01:53:38,678 --> 01:53:41,442
These were in a script of a movie
I've spoken as directed

1640
01:53:41,881 --> 01:53:43,712
If you take them as real
it is not my fault

1641
01:53:43,817 --> 01:53:45,785
Then, why do you
speak such dialogues?

1642
01:53:55,295 --> 01:53:59,254
Why do you go behind a girl and
force her to move with you?

1643
01:53:59,566 --> 01:54:00,658
What do you think of yourself?

1644
01:54:04,103 --> 01:54:07,004
I have never thought I am a great man

1645
01:54:07,340 --> 01:54:08,773
Then, what is the need
for those black cats?

1646
01:54:08,875 --> 01:54:11,435
Government has provided that facility

1647
01:54:12,745 --> 01:54:16,909
If something happens to me, guys like
you would incinerate some people

1648
01:54:20,620 --> 01:54:23,885
I didn't give you an appointment
because some minister told me

1649
01:54:24,157 --> 01:54:25,021
I heard about your
school's good reputation.

1650
01:54:25,191 --> 01:54:26,522
I wanted to meet you hence I allowed.

1651
01:54:26,826 --> 01:54:28,521
Moreover, I am here for a
film shooting and that is my job

1652
01:54:28,795 --> 01:54:31,161
And not to reply to strangers

1653
01:54:31,631 --> 01:54:34,566
Oh God! Please don't refuse
because of him

1654
01:54:34,701 --> 01:54:36,999
Our school students are
yearning to meet you

1655
01:54:37,203 --> 01:54:41,003
Listen, many people want to meet me
What you say is true. I accept.

1656
01:54:41,207 --> 01:54:42,367
Understand something.

1657
01:54:42,575 --> 01:54:44,941
People would watch
a movie only if it is good

1658
01:54:45,044 --> 01:54:48,912
If it is not good, they won't go
even if I am acting in it

1659
01:54:49,883 --> 01:54:52,909
I didn't earn this stardom
and heroism on my own

1660
01:54:53,152 --> 01:54:57,054
I've got this title because of
good roles and storyline

1661
01:54:57,624 --> 01:54:59,023
All this credit goes to them

1662
01:54:59,392 --> 01:55:01,986
I am a commoner man like you

1663
01:55:02,328 --> 01:55:04,455
I too have emotions
like happiness and anger

1664
01:55:04,931 --> 01:55:06,023
He mentioned about Kamal

1665
01:55:07,400 --> 01:55:09,095
You're nothing special
but you're flaunting so much

1666
01:55:09,302 --> 01:55:11,270
But Kamal is a great actor.
He has won many awards and accolades.

1667
01:55:11,638 --> 01:55:13,663
What is wrong if he flaunts?

1668
01:55:13,940 --> 01:55:18,502
You think that people in cine field are
making easy money and acquiring stardom

1669
01:55:18,745 --> 01:55:21,873
It is not so easy. We know
the troubles and how hard it is.

1670
01:55:23,549 --> 01:55:27,485
- I apologize on his behalf
- No need to seek pardon

1671
01:55:27,687 --> 01:55:30,918
I don't like flatterers
as well as chatter boxes

1672
01:55:31,057 --> 01:55:33,719
Similarly, Amitabh Bachchan told me once

1673
01:55:34,260 --> 01:55:38,162
If I go to Bombay he only picks me up

1674
01:55:40,400 --> 01:55:45,428
If he talks more you may have
to witness me bashing him

1675
01:55:45,571 --> 01:55:46,799
Why?

1676
01:55:47,573 --> 01:55:49,905
- Please come with me
- What?

1677
01:55:50,843 --> 01:55:52,208
- Come -Where?
Where are you taking me?

1678
01:55:52,946 --> 01:55:54,573
- Why unnecessary talk?
- Why?

1679
01:55:55,882 --> 01:55:57,179
Please be seated in the car

1680
01:56:00,153 --> 01:56:03,987
Hello Shahrukh Khan, do you
have a finance problem?

1681
01:56:04,190 --> 01:56:05,623
Never mind!

1682
01:56:05,825 --> 01:56:08,350
- But don't take him when
you go somewhere -No sir

1683
01:56:09,095 --> 01:56:13,031
Seeing a great actor like you,
he also tried to boast

1684
01:56:13,399 --> 01:56:15,867
Please don't take this to heart
and refuse to come

1685
01:56:16,002 --> 01:56:19,130
No, I will attend the school function
but ensure I don't see him throughout...

1686
01:56:19,272 --> 01:56:22,036
...because the old Ashok kumar
is still inside me

1687
01:56:22,141 --> 01:56:24,336
He won't come definitely
I'll ensure that

1688
01:56:24,477 --> 01:56:27,503
My shooting gets over on 15th
You may fix it for 16th

1689
01:56:28,381 --> 01:56:29,678
Greetings!

1690
01:56:57,143 --> 01:56:58,474
- Is that Ragavendra guest house?
- Yes

1691
01:56:58,611 --> 01:57:01,774
- I am Balu calling from Sirisilla
- What do you want?

1692
01:57:01,914 --> 01:57:05,008
I want to talk to Superstar
Can you connect me to him?

1693
01:57:05,184 --> 01:57:08,813
- What? - I am calling from outskirts
of village without anyone's knowledge

1694
01:57:08,988 --> 01:57:10,387
I want to talk to Super star once

1695
01:57:10,656 --> 01:57:15,059
Barber Balu. Tell him
I am barber Venkataramaiah's son.

1696
01:57:15,261 --> 01:57:17,092
- He'll talk immediately
- Please wait

1697
01:57:18,431 --> 01:57:21,195
God! He should talk to me

1698
01:57:25,304 --> 01:57:27,829
- Who is it?
- I am barber Balakrishnan

1699
01:57:28,174 --> 01:57:30,233
I studied with Super star in school.

1700
01:57:30,576 --> 01:57:32,601
Tell him I am Balakrishnan,
he'll talk to me

1701
01:57:32,745 --> 01:57:36,010
I am SP Sathyananda speaking

1702
01:57:37,183 --> 01:57:43,588
I... studied with Ashok in school.
Please... inform Ashok. He'll talk.

1703
01:57:43,756 --> 01:57:45,917
Where is your house?
Where is it?

1704
01:57:53,066 --> 01:57:57,230
Forget everything and sleep peacefully.

1705
01:57:58,771 --> 01:58:01,137
I won't get sleep even if I close my eyes

1706
01:58:01,941 --> 01:58:04,239
I slept peacefully even
when I had no money

1707
01:58:05,378 --> 01:58:10,714
I have lost my sleep since
that great actor came here

1708
01:58:11,551 --> 01:58:16,648
Even if I don't sleep let that lamp sleep

1709
01:58:17,857 --> 01:58:19,188
Put off that light

1710
01:59:23,122 --> 01:59:27,081
<i>God gave a glance from the heaven...</i>

1711
01:59:27,260 --> 01:59:31,128
<i>You came near me and aroused me</i>

1712
01:59:31,364 --> 01:59:34,959
<i>You're the real man.</i>

1713
01:59:51,918 --> 01:59:55,820
<i>God gave a glance from the heaven...</i>

1714
01:59:56,022 --> 02:00:00,015
<i>You came near me and aroused me</i>

1715
02:00:00,159 --> 02:00:03,526
<i>You're the real man.</i>

1716
02:00:03,629 --> 02:00:07,759
<i>You came into my heart</i>
<i>as a gentleman and a lover.</i>

1717
02:00:07,867 --> 02:00:12,463
<i>You opened up my dreams as a cupid.</i>

1718
02:00:49,542 --> 02:00:53,410
<i>If I touch you once...</i>

1719
02:00:53,613 --> 02:00:57,515
<i>... I live my lifelong.</i>

1720
02:00:57,817 --> 02:01:01,617
<i>If I don't rule you once as a king...</i>

1721
02:01:01,954 --> 02:01:05,549
<i>This man's life will go waste.</i>

1722
02:01:06,058 --> 02:01:09,858
<i>Am pretty.</i>

1723
02:01:10,062 --> 02:01:13,896
<i>You're daring.</i>

1724
02:01:14,166 --> 02:01:17,567
<i>Let's mingle like a knot.</i>

1725
02:01:17,670 --> 02:01:21,731
<i>And share our joys.</i>

1726
02:01:34,754 --> 02:01:38,656
<i>You've become a heavenly flower</i>

1727
02:01:38,891 --> 02:01:42,827
<i>You bestowed your beauty</i>
<i>to me as a feast.</i>

1728
02:01:43,062 --> 02:01:46,828
<i>Wonder means it is only you.</i>

1729
02:02:28,274 --> 02:02:32,210
<i>You're a glittering black handsome man.</i>

1730
02:02:32,378 --> 02:02:36,246
<i>Will you give pleasure</i>
<i>with your affection?</i>

1731
02:02:36,482 --> 02:02:40,441
<i>Shall I share my heart with this victor?</i>

1732
02:02:40,619 --> 02:02:44,487
<i>Shall I kiss you with my lips?</i>

1733
02:02:44,724 --> 02:02:48,558
<i>Oh pretty! You have shown</i>
<i>great affection to me.</i>

1734
02:02:48,828 --> 02:02:52,491
<i>How could I leave you</i>
<i>when you reach me?</i>

1735
02:02:52,932 --> 02:02:55,992
<i>You are a real beauty</i>
<i>of the private chamber.</i>

1736
02:02:56,102 --> 02:02:59,799
<i>Now I am going to have you.</i>

1737
02:03:42,281 --> 02:03:46,308
<i>You've become a heavenly flower</i>

1738
02:03:46,452 --> 02:03:50,445
<i>You bestowed your beauty</i>
<i>to me as a feast.</i>

1739
02:03:50,623 --> 02:03:54,320
<i>Wonder means it is only you.</i>

1740
02:04:02,935 --> 02:04:06,871
<i>God gave a glance from the heaven...</i>

1741
02:04:07,006 --> 02:04:10,999
<i>You came near me and aroused me</i>

1742
02:04:11,143 --> 02:04:15,079
<i>You're the real man.</i>

1743
02:04:28,360 --> 02:04:33,127
We fans won't accept if you don't
release atleast 3 films in a year. Ok?

1744
02:04:42,208 --> 02:04:44,108
Keep big bouquets at the entrance

1745
02:04:44,677 --> 02:04:46,907
They'll do it properly
We haven't yet prepared

1746
02:04:47,012 --> 02:04:49,572
Who are the speakers and
who will be seated in dais?

1747
02:04:50,583 --> 02:04:51,948
Who is going to head this gathering?

1748
02:04:52,218 --> 02:04:53,845
Panchayat board president
or the Church Priest?

1749
02:04:54,019 --> 02:04:55,680
You please head this gathering

1750
02:04:56,589 --> 02:04:59,080
- Are we going to serve him snacks?
- No need of all that

1751
02:04:59,225 --> 02:05:01,352
He'll come straight to the dais

1752
02:05:01,494 --> 02:05:03,758
Just keep a water bottle
and nothing else

1753
02:05:04,830 --> 02:05:07,298
Enough of pressing it mom.

1754
02:05:07,433 --> 02:05:09,958
Superstar will go back
by the time you finish

1755
02:05:10,135 --> 02:05:14,196
Shouldn't you go neatly dressed?
Many people will be coming. Wait.

1756
02:05:14,406 --> 02:05:17,500
Mom, give me some money
to buy eatables

1757
02:05:17,676 --> 02:05:22,443
- I've no money. Ask dad.
- Give, if you have. No need from Dad.

1758
02:05:23,215 --> 02:05:27,879
- Shut up -Getting late mom. We may not
get a place to sit in that crowd.

1759
02:05:28,220 --> 02:05:30,780
No need to sit. It is enough even if
we just watch him.

1760
02:05:30,923 --> 02:05:33,118
- Bye mom.
- Bye mom. - Ok

1761
02:05:33,325 --> 02:05:34,815
Go carefully.

1762
02:05:36,695 --> 02:05:39,562
- Inform Dad
- You inform him.

1763
02:05:39,932 --> 02:05:41,900
They're fussing too much.

1764
02:05:42,668 --> 02:05:44,295
Let them come back.
I will teach them a lesson.

1765
02:05:44,436 --> 02:05:46,404
Afterall they are kids.
Don't mind them.

1766
02:05:48,240 --> 02:05:49,867
- Has the Super star come?
- Not yet

1767
02:05:50,042 --> 02:05:52,567
We've come on time.
You talk to them and come.

1768
02:05:52,678 --> 02:05:53,872
- Ok boss
- Go on.

1769
02:05:55,381 --> 02:05:57,474
- My boss has come.
- Whom are you talking of?

1770
02:05:57,650 --> 02:05:59,845
Dharmaraja sir
is waiting in the jeep

1771
02:06:01,053 --> 02:06:02,680
Money lender?
What is it?

1772
02:06:02,821 --> 02:06:06,222
If you don't mind he wants to
talk about Superstar in the meeting

1773
02:06:06,425 --> 02:06:07,722
Super star should feel
blessed to hear him talk

1774
02:06:07,893 --> 02:06:08,882
But on one condition

1775
02:06:09,094 --> 02:06:10,823
My boss should be seated
next to Super star

1776
02:06:10,930 --> 02:06:13,797
He can sit on his lap
Get lost!

1777
02:06:13,966 --> 02:06:14,933
Go away!

1778
02:06:16,402 --> 02:06:17,300
Great insult

1779
02:06:17,469 --> 02:06:20,700
- What happened? - Says he won't
allow paupers and scoundrels like you

1780
02:06:21,173 --> 02:06:24,506
- Start the vehicle. - Start.
Go. I feel insulted if I stay here.

1781
02:06:24,710 --> 02:06:27,941
Shall I ask you something?

1782
02:06:28,514 --> 02:06:32,109
Are you both really childhood friends?

1783
02:06:37,256 --> 02:06:41,249
He doesn't remember me.
If you don't believe then who else will?

1784
02:06:41,427 --> 02:06:44,328
Even if others don't believe,
I believe you

1785
02:06:45,164 --> 02:06:48,656
I became his fan
after watching his films

1786
02:06:48,867 --> 02:06:52,496
I've also read all his interviews
and have understood about him

1787
02:06:53,606 --> 02:06:58,509
I like him as a actor
and also as a person

1788
02:06:59,411 --> 02:07:04,041
I feel sad to hear that he is
going away from here today

1789
02:07:04,216 --> 02:07:09,051
He came so close to us.
Don't know when we'll meet him.

1790
02:07:09,521 --> 02:07:15,084
I wanted to go with kids.
But didn't go because you would be alone

1791
02:07:15,194 --> 02:07:20,894
- What do you mean?
- I thought I'll go with you to watch him

1792
02:07:21,433 --> 02:07:24,960
But didn't want to go
as others would insult you

1793
02:07:25,104 --> 02:07:26,571
Do you want to see him?

1794
02:07:27,806 --> 02:07:29,797
- Then, get ready to go
- Really

1795
02:07:29,975 --> 02:07:31,636
Let me fulfill atleast
this desire of yours

1796
02:07:32,011 --> 02:07:33,137
My goodness!

1797
02:07:36,448 --> 02:07:39,008
- I got a call that Ashok kumar has
started from the guest house. - Is it?

1798
02:07:39,251 --> 02:07:41,151
Arrange for the garland,
drums and crackers

1799
02:07:41,353 --> 02:07:47,087
Children, ensure none passes any comment
Don't pester for photos or autographs

1800
02:07:47,192 --> 02:07:50,491
If you do, you and our school
will get a bad name, understood?

1801
02:07:58,237 --> 02:08:01,104
Sir, where were you?
Why have you come so late?

1802
02:08:01,240 --> 02:08:04,767
Since the actor is coming,
I went to buy a bouquet for him

1803
02:08:05,010 --> 02:08:08,036
He is short tempered
I don't like his speech

1804
02:08:08,247 --> 02:08:09,578
But still he is coming to our place

1805
02:08:09,715 --> 02:08:12,411
If I give him the bouquet
he would feel honoured

1806
02:08:13,352 --> 02:08:15,252
Of all the people here
you look handsome

1807
02:08:15,621 --> 02:08:17,418
But if you adorn a makeup
you will look more handsome

1808
02:08:17,523 --> 02:08:18,455
Where do we have a makeup room?

1809
02:08:18,557 --> 02:08:21,617
Come, we've a full setup there
with big mirrors

1810
02:08:33,405 --> 02:08:34,963
This is not a makeup room
but a lockup for you

1811
02:09:03,035 --> 02:09:04,332
Greetings sir!

1812
02:09:13,212 --> 02:09:16,704
We're unable to believe
whatever happening is true

1813
02:09:16,882 --> 02:09:22,081
A great actor has come to this school
in this small village, Sirisilla

1814
02:09:25,457 --> 02:09:28,449
All who've assembled here
would be visualizing and admiring...

1815
02:09:28,660 --> 02:09:31,925
...his various characters in movies

1816
02:09:35,234 --> 02:09:41,298
His speech, gait and even
his silence also amazes us.

1817
02:09:45,711 --> 02:09:51,047
Even if he says that all
this credit goes to the movie makers...

1818
02:09:51,150 --> 02:09:54,142
...his acting prowess has
made him famous.

1819
02:09:57,556 --> 02:10:02,550
His national and international awards
serve as evidence for this

1820
02:10:05,597 --> 02:10:10,967
The super star prevailing
in the heart of every Telugu...

1821
02:10:11,069 --> 02:10:14,129
...I invite him to speak to us

1822
02:10:18,110 --> 02:10:19,407
Look there!

1823
02:10:20,913 --> 02:10:22,312
Oh gosh!

1824
02:10:32,191 --> 02:10:34,921
To the school teachers who take care
of children like their parents...

1825
02:10:35,127 --> 02:10:37,493
...brothers and sisters,
the villagers...

1826
02:10:37,629 --> 02:10:38,994
...to beloved children,
my fans who support me...

1827
02:10:39,164 --> 02:10:41,189
...to my fans who are
greater than my life...

1828
02:10:41,400 --> 02:10:42,799
My greetings to all of you

1829
02:10:45,304 --> 02:10:50,037
As sir said,
I too didn't expect to meet you all

1830
02:10:50,175 --> 02:10:52,268
You are thinking that
you have come to see me.

1831
02:10:52,711 --> 02:10:54,975
It is me who has come to see you all.

1832
02:10:55,347 --> 02:10:59,374
Whatever happened in my life is
not because of my decision earlier.

1833
02:10:59,484 --> 02:11:01,816
Everything is decided by him (God).

1834
02:11:03,155 --> 02:11:07,182
You were unable to see the
film shooting happening in your place

1835
02:11:07,392 --> 02:11:10,850
On behalf of my team
I apologise to everyone here.

1836
02:11:11,330 --> 02:11:15,130
I sent back my commandos,
because I wanted to see you.

1837
02:11:15,267 --> 02:11:18,464
But wherever you are, no one else
can give me better protection than you.

1838
02:11:22,140 --> 02:11:24,040
I am not seeing
this children as students...

1839
02:11:24,409 --> 02:11:29,142
...but as future intellectuals,
scientists, experts and artistes.

1840
02:11:29,348 --> 02:11:32,408
I see them as the future
who will make our nation proud.

1841
02:11:32,551 --> 02:11:37,250
I respect everyone.
But I treat teachers as Gods.

1842
02:11:39,558 --> 02:11:42,823
Teachers make us sit.
But they stand and teach.

1843
02:11:42,995 --> 02:11:47,261
They stay there till the end,
but we go very far.

1844
02:11:47,599 --> 02:11:52,036
You shouldn't forget the teacher
even if you reach heights.

1845
02:11:52,271 --> 02:11:54,831
All of you may be knowing
the world famous Bill Gates

1846
02:11:55,073 --> 02:11:58,634
But how many know that
his father is a teacher?

1847
02:12:00,212 --> 02:12:03,773
I wish to tell something
to these children.

1848
02:12:03,882 --> 02:12:07,909
You choose a good friend
here in your life.

1849
02:12:08,053 --> 02:12:09,281
The friend who sits next to you...

1850
02:12:09,454 --> 02:12:12,651
The one who is clad in uniform
wouldn't expect anything from you.

1851
02:12:12,858 --> 02:12:15,952
He would be true to you and
wouldn't have any jealousy or enmity.

1852
02:12:18,397 --> 02:12:22,390
He doesn't move with us knowing
what we would become in future

1853
02:12:22,534 --> 02:12:26,868
He will point out your errors,
irrespective of our status

1854
02:12:27,406 --> 02:12:31,866
As I tell about all this,
I remember my childhood days now.

1855
02:12:32,344 --> 02:12:37,873
Now you have enough to dress,
food and books.

1856
02:12:39,217 --> 02:12:44,519
Can you imagine an Ashok kumar
who didn't have all these facilities?

1857
02:12:47,292 --> 02:12:49,021
Those days, I was an ordinary Ashok.

1858
02:12:49,261 --> 02:12:51,786
I was the son of Raj kumar
who was very poor.

1859
02:12:52,197 --> 02:12:53,858
We had no money to buy clothes

1860
02:12:54,066 --> 02:12:59,527
I used to go to school wearing
patched shirts and torn pants.

1861
02:13:02,107 --> 02:13:03,699
We had no money
to buy an umbrella

1862
02:13:03,875 --> 02:13:06,901
I used to go to school having
banana leaf on my head to avoid rains.

1863
02:13:07,079 --> 02:13:08,569
I am that same Ashok

1864
02:13:10,582 --> 02:13:14,951
There is a person behind
everyone's success and to motivate.

1865
02:13:15,887 --> 02:13:17,946
I too had one such friend.

1866
02:13:18,256 --> 02:13:19,780
My dearest friend
who adored a red stud...

1867
02:13:19,992 --> 02:13:23,052
He intended to make me
achieve something...

1868
02:13:23,862 --> 02:13:28,697
All this stardom is only
because of my friend Balakrishnan.

1869
02:13:33,138 --> 02:13:35,572
My dearest friend Balu.

1870
02:13:40,545 --> 02:13:41,705
My Balu.

1871
02:13:46,485 --> 02:13:56,326
He shared his food with me when he
saw me drinking water during lunch break.

1872
02:13:57,729 --> 02:13:59,663
He used to bring money
without his father's knowledge

1873
02:13:59,865 --> 02:14:04,131
With that we had seen
lot of movies at the touring talkies.

1874
02:14:04,336 --> 02:14:08,636
The first film I ever saw in my life
is with his money only.

1875
02:14:15,380 --> 02:14:18,008
He used to buy me groundnut
candy because I liked it.

1876
02:14:18,850 --> 02:14:21,910
He showed more interest
in my life than his.

1877
02:14:22,387 --> 02:14:26,153
He wished that I should
achieve something big.

1878
02:14:26,291 --> 02:14:29,818
When his father was not in shop,
he use to make me sit in the chair...

1879
02:14:29,995 --> 02:14:33,988
...do me a haircut and beautify me.

1880
02:14:41,139 --> 02:14:44,700
He was the first one to say
I can become a great actor.

1881
02:14:45,177 --> 02:14:48,169
I saw this world through his eyes only.

1882
02:14:48,447 --> 02:14:51,109
He only developed the passion
in me towards cinema.

1883
02:14:52,551 --> 02:14:56,510
When I qualified my 10th grade,
I had no means to study further.

1884
02:14:56,721 --> 02:14:57,847
I was penniless.

1885
02:14:57,989 --> 02:15:00,787
I didn't know what to do
The whole world became dark.

1886
02:15:01,393 --> 02:15:04,294
My friend Balu asked me
to try acting in films...

1887
02:15:04,463 --> 02:15:06,192
...and said I would
become a good artiste.

1888
02:15:06,398 --> 02:15:09,424
I asked him how is it possible

1889
02:15:09,601 --> 02:15:13,867
He said, "when you did Duryodhana's
role in 'Kurukshetra' drama...

1890
02:15:14,005 --> 02:15:15,632
...everyone praised you"

1891
02:15:15,807 --> 02:15:19,971
"They praised not for
your acting but for your style"

1892
02:15:20,479 --> 02:15:21,707
"You would become a good actor"

1893
02:15:21,880 --> 02:15:24,280
He asked me to go to Madras

1894
02:15:24,583 --> 02:15:32,422
He sold his ear studs and sent me
to Madras with that money.

1895
02:15:41,099 --> 02:15:44,626
I asked him how to repay
that money to him.

1896
02:15:46,271 --> 02:15:48,705
He gave a reply which
I remember even now.

1897
02:15:50,375 --> 02:15:53,003
"You have nothing to repay me."

1898
02:15:53,411 --> 02:15:57,074
"If you achieve good status and
you become rich enough to help others..."

1899
02:15:57,249 --> 02:16:02,619
"...and if someone comes to you for help,
then remember me."

1900
02:16:03,321 --> 02:16:04,948
"That's enough"

1901
02:16:10,729 --> 02:16:15,291
The Ashok who came to
Chennai with that money...

1902
02:16:16,635 --> 02:16:19,468
...is standing before you as actor Ashok.

1903
02:16:21,006 --> 02:16:22,371
I am here in front of you...

1904
02:16:23,575 --> 02:16:28,478
But I don't know where my friend is.

1905
02:16:33,084 --> 02:16:34,711
I don't know where he is.

1906
02:16:47,065 --> 02:16:50,034
He eloped with someone
after an affair...

1907
02:16:50,769 --> 02:16:52,669
...but he hasn't still left my heart.

1908
02:16:53,538 --> 02:16:57,269
He made me rich with his money

1909
02:16:57,509 --> 02:16:59,101
My friend Balakrishnan!

1910
02:16:59,511 --> 02:17:01,638
He is in my soul.

1911
02:17:06,585 --> 02:17:14,424
Friend! I've grown to this position,
but you are not with me.

1912
02:17:14,559 --> 02:17:17,255
It reminds me of you every minute.

1913
02:17:19,965 --> 02:17:22,297
Elders taught us
mother, father, teacher and God.

1914
02:17:22,434 --> 02:17:24,197
Don't know why they
have left 'friend' from it.

1915
02:17:24,369 --> 02:17:25,267
As far as I am concerned...

1916
02:17:25,403 --> 02:17:30,864
It should be "mother, father, teacher,
a good friend and then only comes God"

1917
02:17:39,150 --> 02:17:41,744
Long live Telugus!
May Andhra Pradesh excel!

1918
02:17:41,953 --> 02:17:43,079
Victory to India!

1919
02:17:49,661 --> 02:17:52,221
I've never been anybody's fan

1920
02:17:52,764 --> 02:17:57,064
From now I am also his fan

1921
02:17:59,838 --> 02:18:01,237
Oh God!

1922
02:18:04,676 --> 02:18:08,168
Dear, what is this?

1923
02:18:10,048 --> 02:18:14,576
I've seen him smiling and in anger

1924
02:18:15,287 --> 02:18:17,881
But I've never seen him cry

1925
02:18:19,424 --> 02:18:22,655
He doesn't cry even when hungry

1926
02:18:23,828 --> 02:18:27,594
But he cried for this friend

1927
02:18:27,766 --> 02:18:34,467
He narrated everything from feeding him
and selling ear stud for him

1928
02:18:34,906 --> 02:18:38,672
But you never told me all this

1929
02:18:41,980 --> 02:18:45,040
You've made me like this just
for telling that I am his friend

1930
02:18:46,251 --> 02:18:48,481
Had I told you all that, then...

1931
02:18:56,127 --> 02:18:58,061
What happened?
Did it get over?

1932
02:18:58,196 --> 02:19:03,156
Yes mom, when he told
about dad everyone cried

1933
02:19:03,702 --> 02:19:06,762
- We also cried
- When did you come?

1934
02:19:06,938 --> 02:19:09,964
Not only me, even your dad had come

1935
02:19:12,043 --> 02:19:13,374
Is it?

1936
02:19:19,351 --> 02:19:23,185
- Forgive us dad
- Sorry dad.

1937
02:19:24,189 --> 02:19:26,623
You've done no wrong to get pardoned.

1938
02:19:26,825 --> 02:19:29,726
At your age, I would
have also behaved like that

1939
02:19:29,961 --> 02:19:33,226
Dad, we've hurt you unnecessarily.

1940
02:19:33,765 --> 02:19:39,465
- Why didn't you meet him then?
- There?

1941
02:19:44,008 --> 02:19:45,305
Here?

1942
02:20:25,917 --> 02:20:26,941
I heard...

1943
02:20:28,787 --> 02:20:32,416
I heard standing in a corner
what all you spoke in the meeting

1944
02:20:32,557 --> 02:20:39,224
- In a corner? - Normally people forget
the past when they acquire a status

1945
02:20:40,765 --> 02:20:42,699
But you still remember everything

1946
02:20:43,168 --> 02:20:44,533
That is why you've grown so big

1947
02:20:44,669 --> 02:20:46,694
It is hard for me to reach you

1948
02:20:47,439 --> 02:20:49,930
Was it hard for you to reach me?

1949
02:20:50,408 --> 02:20:52,035
I searched for you everywhere
but of no use.

1950
02:20:52,510 --> 02:20:54,375
You could've searched and
come to me, but you didn't

1951
02:20:55,513 --> 02:20:58,311
Didn't you ever miss me?

1952
02:20:58,483 --> 02:21:04,649
You know well because
I married Sridevi we had to elope

1953
02:21:05,089 --> 02:21:08,149
Later, I was forced to live independently

1954
02:21:08,927 --> 02:21:12,658
Many years flew away in a jiffy

1955
02:21:13,264 --> 02:21:17,564
By then you had gone very far

1956
02:21:18,102 --> 02:21:23,005
Don't know what to talk to you even if
I reach you with my current status

1957
02:21:25,109 --> 02:21:30,069
In the beginning
I also wanted to meet you

1958
02:21:30,882 --> 02:21:38,379
Seeing your fast growth
I felt scared to approach you

1959
02:21:39,224 --> 02:21:44,753
- I had an inferiority complex
- With me?

1960
02:21:46,598 --> 02:21:47,690
Damn!

1961
02:21:55,607 --> 02:21:56,938
Gosh!

1962
02:21:58,409 --> 02:22:00,172
Children of my friend Balu!

1963
02:22:05,750 --> 02:22:06,648
Your names?

1964
02:22:13,224 --> 02:22:16,591
Uncle, can we take a photograph with you?

1965
02:22:16,761 --> 02:22:19,423
Photograph? Henceforth,
all of you are going to stay with me

1966
02:22:19,631 --> 02:22:20,655
No thanks.

1967
02:22:22,367 --> 02:22:23,698
What is it buddy?

1968
02:22:24,836 --> 02:22:27,566
I know no place is better than
the place which gives us a living

1969
02:22:28,740 --> 02:22:31,106
But I've no other relatives than these

1970
02:22:34,045 --> 02:22:37,173
I'll go home. I'll arrange for a place
and then take you with me

1971
02:22:37,549 --> 02:22:39,642
What dear? Have you all forgotten?

1972
02:22:39,851 --> 02:22:42,581
- Lf I say something once...
- It is like saying it a hundred times

1973
02:22:43,655 --> 02:22:44,553
Come!

1974
02:22:54,699 --> 02:22:58,601
Only because of this Ashok
I became the Super star!

1975
02:22:58,970 --> 02:23:03,100
Balu of your place is my dear friend!

1976
02:23:12,917 --> 02:23:14,043
What happened?

1977
02:23:15,219 --> 02:23:18,086
He has started but I am yet
to take a snap with him

1978
02:23:18,189 --> 02:23:21,386
Where else will he go?
He will always be with us

1979
02:23:41,212 --> 02:23:47,173
Getting good friends is
God's grace. - P. Vasu
