1
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,835
Maurice...

2
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,473
No, take him out.
He doesn't belong there...

3
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,191
Maurice.

4
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,195
This can't be...
They're covering him up...

5
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,878
ending up like this...

6
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,111
Maurice, we were just speaking
yesterday, just yesterday, we sat...

7
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,435
I didn't get to say goodbye.

8
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,149
I didn't see him.

9
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,076
You're a widow like me.

10
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,472
We are widows.

11
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:18,476
A FILM BY RONIT ELKABETZ
SHLOMI ELKABETZ

12
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,032
Meir, Haim, you have to recite
the prayer for the dead.

13
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,711
What a tragedy has befallen us...
- Haim, we have to recite the prayer.

14
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,194
Your son is gone!
He's gone!

15
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,718
Masks! Masks!

16
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,796
What should we do?

17
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,839
Hold Mother.

18
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,589
Don't move!
The family stays here.

19
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,989
Vivian, put on your mask.

20
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,269
Mother, put on your mask.

21
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,151
"Exalted and sanctified
is God's great name." -Amen.

22
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,434
"In the world
which He has created

23
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,196
and may He establish
His kingdom in your lifetime

24
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,511
and during your days,
and within the life

25
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,639
of the entire house of Israel
speedily and soon, Amen

26
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:52,438
"May His great name be blessed
forever and to all eternity

27
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,633
"Blessed and praised,
glorified,

28
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,638
"extolled
and honored, elevated,

29
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,031
"and lauded
by the Name of the Holy one,

30
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,950
"blessed by he, beyond
all the blessings

31
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,954
"and hymns, praises
and consolations

32
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,071
"that are spoken in the world:
And say" -Amen.

33
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,273
"May there be great peace from
heaven and life for us;

34
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,834
"and for all Israel
and say 'Amen."

35
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:49,559
"Shiva"
Seven Days

36
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,389
Ita...

37
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,038
What would I do without you?

38
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,517
What a mess. - Not now, Haim,
go inside, they're waiting for you.

39
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,073
I'm sorry, Ita.

40
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,870
Don't be. Do what has to be
done and be done with it.

41
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,114
Yes...

42
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,159
Are you coming in?

43
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,234
I'll come later.

44
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,554
I'll find a solution.

45
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,719
Sure.

46
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,593
What's he doing here?

47
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,117
What's wrong with you?
He came for the prayers.

48
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,708
Come to prayer...

49
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,911
Sit down, Mother.
- No, no, I'll sit on the floor.

50
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,758
But the Rabbi said aloud you
could sit in a chair, Mother.

51
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,032
You can't sit on the floor like
that in your condition. - No, no...

52
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,998
It's forbidden.
- Let her sit on the floor.

53
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,272
Are you managing?
- Everything's under control. - Good.

54
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,394
What's that, Lilly?

55
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,953
Gizzards.

56
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,031
I can see they're gizzards.

57
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,393
You don't eat meat during
the mourning period. - We do.

58
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,589
I'll ask Jacques.
- Ask him.

59
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,838
Gizzards...

60
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,552
This is no time
to be laughing. It's forbidden!

61
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,109
Evelyn...

62
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,991
Listen, I'm sleeping here with you.

63
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,912
Have you gone mad? You can't.

64
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,873
If you sleep here tonight, you'll
have to spend the whole week here.

65
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,516
And the children?
- My sister.

66
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,752
It's out of the question.
- And if the voters come?

67
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,350
As the wife of the next
mayor, I should be here.

68
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,990
Who'll make the effort to come during
a war? - Mind your own business.

69
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,713
I'm staying with you, my dear.

70
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,835
Where's llana?

71
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,075
Upstairs.

72
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,078
He needs me here.

73
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,478
What's this? Llana, it's forbidden
to sit on a bed. You can't stay here.

74
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,033
Everyone has to come downstairs.

75
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,310
We also have to cover the...

76
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,031
mirror, the pictures, everything.

77
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,394
There's no other way,
llana, nothing else is acceptable.

78
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,038
Do you seal this room?
- No, we sealed Ronen's room.

79
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,277
We checked it, it's small, llana.
- Last week no one thought

80
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,914
we'd be 40 people mourning
Maurice in a sealed room.

81
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,115
Please, Jackie,
let me have this room.

82
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,150
Trust me, llana,
I understand you.

83
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:50,239
But you know, it's only a week.
Come down, everyone's waiting.

84
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,195
Downstairs, downstairs.

85
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,035
Ben Lulu,

86
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,513
who arranged this house?

87
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,948
I did.
- You have to cover the pictures.

88
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,473
You have to go through the house,

89
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,113
make sure
the mirrors are covered too.

90
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,714
Don't worry, Eliahu,
everything will be all right.

91
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,395
And the chairs
have to face west, ok?

92
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,551
It's not that complicated.

93
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,990
We have to say the evening
prayer in two hours.

94
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,392
He's something else, that Ben Lulu.

95
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,753
What would we do without him?

96
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,548
What a guy.

97
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,910
Hopefully, this week will be
your big chance to hook him.

98
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,149
How, exactly?
I won't be here, I'm working.

99
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,719
Take time off.

100
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,314
Use your vacation days.

101
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,556
Look...
He takes no notice of me.

102
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,629
She can't do anything before
Eliahu gives her a divorce.

103
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,635
He can keep on dreaming
about Vivian until kingdom comes

104
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,591
but if he still wants
to have a family,

105
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,597
you're his only chance.

106
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,032
Why?
You think he wants children?

107
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,952
What man doesn't?

108
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,598
What a disaster...

109
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,995
Poor guy...

110
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,236
Who would have thought
he'd go like that?

111
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,630
How come he's still single?

112
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:48,635
He probably has lots of problems.
- What do you mean? He's a real man!

113
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:53,997
Like a lion.
Look at that full hair.

114
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,872
He has money.

115
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:02,078
You know what?
We'll ask llana.

116
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,952
She'll know
his story for sure.

117
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,030
Right and she'll tell me?

118
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,919
She barely says 'Hello'
to me. Ilana.

119
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,031
Look at this glass, Thrse.

120
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,556
Look what the poor
guy spent his money on.

121
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,153
Simona...

122
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:34,555
If we hadn't talked, I would have
come crawling to you on all fours.

123
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,079
God help us.

124
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,631
Why? Why? Do you have to?

125
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,995
It's an antique, it was just fixed.

126
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,148
Ilana, there's no room for the
mattresses. Where will we sit?

127
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,431
But not on those cushions.

128
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,480
Of course not, llana. We'll lean
against the wall, don't worry.

129
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,754
Wrap everything
in plastic. It'll be okay.

130
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,713
We'll do it in Ronen's room,
Okay?

131
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,599
This family is wasting
time on nonsense.

132
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,751
Ben Lulu, put on a yamulke.

133
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,639
I'm going upstairs.

134
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,439
Where's Morris? Where is he?

135
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,593
What a shame,
what a shame that he died.

136
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,629
What, Ruthie. They're waiting
for me outside. - I don't care.

137
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,751
Did you send people
to see the house?

138
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,034
Yes.

139
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,276
Did they see it? - No.

140
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,237
Why should I show them my house?

141
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,835
Who are they?

142
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,157
Did you explain to them
that my brother died?

143
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,558
Yes, yes,
but what's going on, Itamar?

144
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,511
I want to sell the house.

145
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,629
What? What are you
talking about, Itamar?

146
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,718
Sell? I'm not selling
my house. - Quiet.

147
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,154
I don't understand you.
What's come over you?

148
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,433
Forget it, it's complicated.
- So explain it to me.

149
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,428
It doesn't concern you.

150
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,632
It concerns me and I...
I don't want to get into it now.

151
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,239
Why you?

152
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,918
Why you?

153
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:38,229
Is anyone else selling his house?

154
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:53,390
Say... weren't you supposed
to sing at Zaguri's Bar Mitzvah?

155
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,388
3 performances were cancelled
because of this war and now this?

156
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,553
You know, now you won't be
able to perform for a whole year.

157
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,708
That's how I make a living.
I don't sing for my pleasure.

158
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,952
You have to ask the Rabbi.
- So we'll ask the Rabbi.

159
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,915
Simona, what are you doing outside?

160
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:25,197
Smoking.
- So smoke inside, dear.

161
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,993
Well?

162
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,031
And take off your jewelry.
We don't need people to talk...

163
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,074
Come on...

164
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,508
What's wrong?

165
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,589
Ben Lulu,

166
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,920
did you get a hold of Orbach?
- I'll see him tomorrow morning.

167
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,030
I'm counting on you, get
as much as you can out of him.

168
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,471
Be pleased
for whatever he offers you.

169
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,756
Why? The equipment alone
is worth half a million.

170
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,753
He won't give you what it's worth.
- So we'll sell to someone else.

171
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,270
Who will you sell to? - It's a viable
business. - It's going bankrupt, Haim.

172
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,318
When tomorrow morning?
- I'm meeting him at 8 o'clock.

173
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,791
I'm sorry you have to deal
with it, Ben Lulu.

174
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,317
Thank you very much, really,
I won't forget this. - Don't worry.

175
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,719
Let's hope everything works out.

176
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,919
Would you like a cup
of tea or some Arak?

177
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,869
I'll be down in a minute.

178
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,952
My back is killing me.

179
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,791
The family has found
itself two maids.

180
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,837
Where is everyone? What is this?
Lilly disappeared.

181
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,077
Iris has such nerve, sitting
in the living room like a guest.

182
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:55,234
Did you see Ruthie?
She's not talking to anyone.

183
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,635
Ita hasn't even come in here.

184
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,840
You're lucky I'm here...

185
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,993
It's a good deed. Maybe, with God's
help, it'll earn you a husband.

186
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,839
Yeah, right!

187
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:16,348
Vivian, do you want a cup of tea?
- No, no, darling.

188
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,040
Is everything all right? - Yes.
Do you have everything? - Yes.

189
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,112
Have you seen Lilly? - No.

190
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,430
Breathe...

191
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,160
I've got a good
feeling about Ben Lulu.

192
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:35,917
Come tomorrow, wear
something nice, catch his eye.

193
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,392
Vivian is not at her best.

194
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,556
I don't think he cares.

195
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,996
Oh, Ben Lulu.

196
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,994
Everything all right, girls?

197
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,078
Everything's fine, Ben Lulu.

198
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,596
Did you happen to see Vivian?
- Vivian?

199
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,753
No, I don't know.

200
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,958
Siren!

201
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,913
A motorcycle...

202
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,998
Sadam Hussein
will give me a heart attack.

203
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,909
Vivian.

204
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,593
What, Ben Lulu?

205
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,712
Do you need anything?

206
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,318
Can I help with anything?

207
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,834
You've done more than enough.
Everything's fine.

208
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,637
"Exalted and sanctified
is God's great name." -Amen.

209
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,872
"In the world which He has created
and may He establish His kingdom

210
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,958
"may his salvation blossom
and his anointed near." -Amen.

211
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:11,317
"In your lifetime and in the
lifetime of all the House of Israel

212
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,910
"Swiftly and soon.
Now say "Amen." -Amen.

213
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:27,519
"Blessed are you, God, through whose
word everything comes into being."

214
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,994
Amen.

215
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,955
Excuse me, since when
do we eat meat when we mourn?

216
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,115
Iraqi Jews do.
- We don't.

217
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,359
It's not customary...

218
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,913
It's not acceptable!

219
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,871
Do I have to tell you that?

220
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,149
Fine. So they made a mistake.
Here, no one will touch it.

221
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,475
Right, do whatever you want.

222
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:09,751
Evelyn, honey,
take the meat off the plates.

223
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,397
God bless you, Evelyn,
no one cooks the way you do.

224
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,279
Freeze it till next week.
- What nonsense...

225
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,836
I didn't make it. This isn't my
first time in a house of mourning.

226
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,672
As if I don't know
you don't eat meat.

227
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,313
It's a known fact.
It's a known fact?

228
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,475
Then who made it?

229
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,830
Enough already. "Who made it,
who brought it... Enough!"

230
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,234
What difference does it make?

231
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,912
Gizzards, hearts...

232
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,319
Maurice loved that...

233
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,352
He'd kill for it.

234
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,758
All the inner parts!

235
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,353
Brains,

236
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,993
intestines...

237
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,314
kidneys,

238
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,273
liver, hearts,

239
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,712
bladder,

240
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,074
testicles.

241
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,952
Innards are Lilly's specialty.

242
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:01,556
God bless you Lilly,

243
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,398
God bless you all.

244
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,716
But no one makes
intestines as well as Mother.

245
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,991
How Maurice loved this.
He'd wait for it every Passover.

246
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:15,034
He'd eat it almost
straight out of the pot.

247
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,708
He liked it so much.

248
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,350
He used to say to me,

249
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,550
"It's good, Mom,
it tastes so good..."

250
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,518
Oh God...

251
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,152
He went, just like that.
How is that possible?

252
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,956
In a flash, Meir, a flash...

253
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,874
He's dancing the whole night

254
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,918
smiling at everyone
and is gone in a flash.

255
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,713
He told me
so many times that evening,

256
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,397
"I love you, llana."

257
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,392
As if he knew his time was up,

258
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,920
I said to him, "Maurice, let's go...

259
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,600
let's go, Maurice, let's go home."

260
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,273
He said, "No...

261
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:13,318
"one more dance, one more song..."
until 4 a.m., he wanted to dance.

262
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,758
He liked to dance, poor soul,
especially rock and roll.

263
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,877
The dance ended,

264
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,275
he fell to the floor,

265
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,749
I shouted, "Maurice, Maurice!"

266
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,754
Everyone came running,
lifted him up...

267
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,159
On the way

268
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,798
before we got to the hospital

269
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,158
he was already gone,

270
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,679
dead.

271
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,229
Just like that,
a stroke took him away!

272
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,998
God have mercy on him.

273
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,639
May he rest in peace.

274
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,834
Zanati, listen to me.

275
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,678
Did you see my face?

276
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,908
What do you mean the color is off?

277
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,950
But I look as white as a boiled egg!

278
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,996
What do you mean,
"we can't do anything about it"?

279
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,078
It has to be ready today.

280
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:43,395
I don't stand a chance if
his posters are ready before mine.

281
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,276
That's... that's cheating!

282
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,708
Of course.
My voters won't recognize me.

283
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,992
God forbid, what's going on there?

284
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,512
She's pretty, Evelyn.

285
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,629
She's a whore.

286
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,314
Why do you say that?
- Because she's a whore.

287
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,829
No, I know her.
She's a good girl.

288
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,518
I don't know...

289
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,592
Meir wants to be mayor.

290
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,712
No, he just wants to work.

291
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,153
It's good, it's good...

292
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,592
Girls, enough already!

293
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,994
Mother Hanina, are you
all right? Open your eyes.

294
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,917
Actually, you look
good in the poster.

295
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,317
Your face is lit up.

296
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,510
We got such
compliments on the jingle.

297
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:54,073
We'll record it after the week
of mourning, okay? - God willing.

298
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,989
But remember, I sing the jingle.

299
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,553
Okay, with God's help, David.

300
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:02,195
If he wins,
he'll take care of his family!

301
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,913
Don't say it. It gives the evil eye!

302
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,995
Why do you say that to me?
- That's what they say, you know.

303
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,754
Are you saying that
I'll bring him bad luck?

304
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:14,390
No, of course not, it's just
better not to talk about it.

305
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,679
Okay, I'll keep quiet.

306
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,229
Evelyn, what is this circus?

307
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,197
You're embarrassing me.

308
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,398
Take that stuff off.
- Okay, okay.

309
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,832
Ben Lulu?
- Meir...

310
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,719
A cup of tea?
- No thank you,

311
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,759
I'll bring you one anyway.

312
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:44,158
Meir, I have to go back to work,
they haven't seen me in two days.

313
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,436
If you need anything, let me know.

314
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,628
Thank you.
- Hi Jacques.

315
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:56,028
I know it's none of my business,

316
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,757
but you have to talk to Haim.
- About what?

317
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,068
We spoke last week,
We all got together.

318
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,594
I see.

319
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,116
There's no way out, Ben Lulu.
The plant is finished, that's it.

320
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,840
I see. But still... I understand
but you should still talk.

321
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,831
Maybe you'll come
up with something.

322
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:19,350
Drop it, Ben Lulu. It's
complicated, it's a family matter.

323
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,158
Okay, Jacques, okay.

324
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,548
You know best.

325
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,791
What does Ben Lulu want?

326
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,838
I showed him where he belongs!!!

327
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,396
What does he think,
that I'm not thinking of my brother?

328
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,512
Oh, great.

329
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,150
I didn't want to insult him
so I didn't say a word.

330
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,279
I'm wracking my brains...
thinking about Haim,

331
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,839
and he comes and says that.

332
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,396
Meir, you have to talk to Haim
and tell him. - Tell him what?

333
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,637
To close down the factory,
to end this story already.

334
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,917
Can you tell him?
- What does he want?

335
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:12,795
That we sell our homes?
- He didn't ask us to do anything.

336
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,598
That's what he expects us to do.

337
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,868
Let me think.

338
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,352
I have an idea.

339
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,157
Look at Mom, God help her...

340
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:36,516
Wait, Meir, it's for Ben Lulu.
- He left.

341
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,357
And take
that butterfly off already!!!

342
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,312
Why? I'm not in mourning.

343
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,749
Don't piss me off, Evelyn, okay?

344
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,710
What are you doing here anyway?
Don't you have to work?

345
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,752
I took time off. - Off? What for?

346
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,839
To help Thrse.

347
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:56,230
So go to the kitchen.
And take that lipstick off.

348
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,557
Okay. Okay.

349
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,709
Oh, Evelyn.

350
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,117
What is that butterfly?

351
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,472
Ita, where's Haim?
- Upstairs.

352
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,878
He has a migraine, leave him alone.

353
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,872
What upstairs, he can't be up there.

354
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,595
Excuse me? He has a headache,
I gave him a strong pill.

355
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,993
What? I broke a fingernail.

356
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,355
Haim.

357
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,359
Is everything all right? - Yes.

358
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,751
We start praying soon.

359
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,878
Does it still hurt?

360
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,638
Did the pill help? - Yes.

361
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,550
It's okay, Ita, it's okay.
- We'll be downstairs.

362
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,035
I'm coming down.

363
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,837
My uncle just called from Germany.

364
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,711
He's sorry he can't come.

365
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,317
He liked Maurice. - Yes...

366
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,991
We'll call him later on.

367
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,792
I'll talk to him, Ita.
He'll understand.

368
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,632
Don't tell me
"He'll understand", Haim.

369
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:48,036
I want you to talk to your brothers.
- What should I say to them?

370
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,593
Why are they keeping quiet?

371
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,958
What do you want them to do?

372
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:56,392
They worked for me, Ita,
they weren't my partners.

373
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,758
They were paid employees.

374
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,872
Excuse me, you can't buy a house
in 3 years on an employee's salary.

375
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:05,749
You were very good at spoiling them.
- Enough, what's done is done.

376
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:09,236
I can't tell them now, "give me
back what I gave to you." It's done.

377
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,517
So why don't they offer
it themselves?

378
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,191
Why...

379
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,558
God knows why. Everyone's
busy with his own affairs.

380
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,112
Your brothers have no shame.

381
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,350
Just four years ago
they each had a...

382
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,830
miserable shop front
and could hardly feed these kids.

383
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,958
Forget about them Ita, drop it.

384
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:32,197
You don't know how it feels not
to have money, you've always had it.

385
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,789
And why do you think
I did all that I did for them?

386
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,638
So that I could come
back a few years later

387
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,558
and say, "Give it back to me."?
- You "did for them"?

388
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:45,037
Yes, for them, so they could raise
their heads, make a new start.

389
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,317
Haim, you did it for yourself.

390
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:50,074
So that you'd have something
of your own. - Why do you say that?

391
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,159
What's wrong?

392
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,359
The plant was doing well. Why
shouldn't I share with my brothers?

393
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,516
The factory succeeded
thanks to them too.

394
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:00,478
Succeeded... the one time I didn't
intervene and look what happened.

395
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,193
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

396
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:06,992
You're enjoying
seeing me humiliated, weak.

397
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,030
Tell me, are you crazy?
What are you going on about?

398
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,714
All I'm asking is you pay my uncle
back the money you owe him.

399
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,757
Otherwise, my mother
will drive me to my grave.

400
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:18,276
Okay, it's time for prayer. Drop
it now, I have to go downstairs.

401
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,714
I don't understand. Why?
Why did you need all this?

402
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,310
Did I ever stop you
from doing anything?

403
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,956
You could have lived
like a king on my money.

404
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,795
Yes, your money, your uncle,
your mother, your houses,

405
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,758
your Germany,
even our girls are yours.

406
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,590
What do you want from me? What?

407
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,596
What about me?
Where do I figure into all of this?

408
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,836
You're right where
you wanted to be. Don't blame me.

409
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,872
Tell me, do you think I could have
continued driving around in a Volvo

410
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,831
while my brothers could barely
afford a Bittle?

411
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,552
How would it look?

412
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,280
When they'd come for help
I never said no, I always helped.

413
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:57,193
Leave me alone now,
I told you I'd take care of it

414
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,793
and that's what I'll do.

415
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,430
I always gave them when they asked.
- What do you want, Ita? What?

416
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,352
Do you want me
to fight with them now?

417
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,473
Now?

418
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,794
With my brother dead?
Is this the right time? What?

419
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,157
I can't decide for them.

420
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:18,113
I spoke to them a week ago.
They know exactly what's going on.

421
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,430
I can't do any more
than that. Nothing.

422
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:25,320
It's no wonder your father
loved Maurice more that anyone else.

423
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,638
What kind of nonsense is that?

424
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,593
He left him the two
shops, didn't he? Why?

425
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,318
Ita, stay out of it.

426
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:37,478
It's none of your business
what my father gave or didn't give.

427
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,599
Drop it.
- Haim. - Drop it.

428
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,396
"Be the Name of the Holy One,
blessed be He." -Amen.

429
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:05,159
"Far beyond all the blessings and
hymns, praises and consolations

430
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:08,590
"that are spoken in the world;
and say, "Amen." -Amen.

431
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,635
Lilly

432
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,273
What are you doing here?

433
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,198
What's wrong, honey?

434
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:28,233
I had to come upstairs.

435
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,674
Come, come, honey.

436
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,837
Let's get out of here before llana
comes up and sees us.

437
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,354
What's wrong?

438
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,314
I know, I know...

439
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,877
He was so handsome.

440
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:27,269
He was worried.

441
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:31,154
He wasn't himself this past year.

442
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,638
It's all her fault.

443
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:38,516
Stop, cherry.
What does it matter now? Come.

444
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:43,834
He told me. She wouldn't let him
relax. The expenses, the traveling...

445
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,312
He was fed up.
Who needs such a big house?

446
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,590
She sucked him dry, Vivian.

447
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:55,872
That's what they wanted...
they wanted it. Come, let's go.

448
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,076
I would have left Jacques for him.

449
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,676
You didn't help
me with this, Vivian.

450
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,558
You were no help.

451
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,754
I was worried about you.

452
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,313
I was afraid for you.

453
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,069
Lilly... Maurice
wouldn't have left llana for you.

454
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,838
Maybe for a stranger.

455
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,030
But a brother would take
another brother's wife?

456
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,036
You were dreaming.

457
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,030
He'd die before
he'd do something like that.

458
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,472
He died.

459
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,439
Your brother is dead, Vivian, dead.

460
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,593
We've been looking
for this for over an hour.

461
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,433
What, cherry?
- Mommy wants her purse.

462
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:12,838
Do you know where it is? - Yes.
- Good. We'll look downstairs.

463
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,474
Come here, cherry.
Good, take it to your mother.

464
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,475
He's waiting for you.

465
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,911
Let him wait. I'm waiting too.
- Vivian...

466
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,588
Lilly, Lilly.

467
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,796
I want to have
a few words with her.

468
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,032
So does she, Eliahu,
but it's not a good time.

469
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,831
Wait until this week is over.

470
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,829
Thrse...

471
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,031
Tell me, what did I hear...

472
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:13,309
Are you and Meir selling the house?
- What are you talking about?

473
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:17,672
No, I just heard, someone
told me. I don't remember who.

474
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,117
That I'm selling the house?
We just finished building it.

475
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:31,557
Ita and Haim are the ones selling
the house in Kiryat Motzkin.

476
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,837
Start serving. They're starving.

477
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,919
I brought Arak.

478
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,115
Look at her.
She hasn't lifted a finger.

479
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,798
She's depressed.
- She wants to be an actress...

480
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:56,598
What does that have to do with it?
She should first have a baby.

481
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,553
She doesn't want to.
It's too soon. Leave her alone.

482
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,593
Right, an actress... 30 years old,
from Kiryat Yam. Who would want her?

483
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:09,232
She has an extra uterine device
- Intrauterine. Intra. Not extra.

484
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,873
Poor Charlie.

485
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:14,751
What about you, Evelyn?
- Me? What about me?

486
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:19,348
I'm as dry as the desert. - Why?
Today, you can have babies at 50.

487
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:24,115
48. - 47
- I'm not 50, Ita.

488
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,919
44 and a half. And I won't have
a child without a man.

489
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:32,193
You're stupid.
Your sister is stupid, Thrse.

490
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,715
Go figure out from whom...

491
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,877
Disgusting...
who knows where it came from...

492
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,194
Nowadays you can
chose a tall, thin, blond man

493
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,676
with blue eyes, a professor,
an engineer from the Technion.

494
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,998
Where is he?
- He'll come.

495
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,714
He'll be here. - With God's
help. - Let's start serving.

496
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,598
It probably costs a lot, no?

497
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,999
I'll pay for it.

498
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,434
I will pay for it.

499
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,834
Anyway this family
has cost me a lot.

500
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,958
Who's snoring?

501
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,158
Who's snoring?

502
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,793
Who is that?

503
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:53,989
Thrse...

504
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,350
What's wrong, Haim?
- Thrse. - Thrse.

505
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,317
Haim, where's llana?

506
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:07,069
It sounds like a carpenter's shop.

507
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,714
It sounds like
she was born in an industrial area.

508
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,756
Simona, you're
in a good mood tonight.

509
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,155
What's that smell?

510
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,356
You let off one.
I can recognize the smell.

511
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,752
You let go at night...

512
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,950
Ilana come, come and see
the future mayor's wife.

513
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,638
Haim, Haim...
- Meir, Meir...

514
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,919
Zanati with the posters.

515
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:37,240
Meir... - Meir, come on,
get up. You have a phone call.

516
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:40,557
From the municipality.
They want you on the phone.

517
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,794
Hello. Who is this?

518
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,239
Get lost!

519
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,313
Thrse...

520
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,589
Thrse...

521
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,389
Thrse!

522
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,279
The siren? Missiles?

523
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:04,035
Where's Meir?
- I'm here.

524
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:24,154
Meir, listen to this...

525
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:28,712
"Ohayon is the one

526
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:32,589
"Meir Ohayon is
better than all the rest

527
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,634
"Kiryat Yam deserves the best...

528
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:40,230
"so cast your ballot
for Meir Ohayon, he's the one."

529
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,635
David, David, this isn't the time.

530
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,548
But it's good, isn't it?

531
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:49,470
It's better than what Ben Harush
suggested. - Yes, yes.

532
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:58,153
Meir... look at Haim.
Look. - I'm looking.

533
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,558
Don't worry,
I might have an idea.

534
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:04,110
What? What?
- Something.

535
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:29,155
Won't Haim notice that we're here?
- He's asleep.

536
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:32,073
I want to talk to you in private.

537
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,352
David... - You went
upstairs without telling me?

538
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:39,034
I'm sorry, I couldn't find you.
We were hurrying.

539
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,878
Sit down.
- You could have called me...

540
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:45,989
Look, yesterday Haim left the house,
he was gone for three hours.

541
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:49,317
I think he went to the factory. - He
had a headache, he was in the room.

542
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,391
Stop defending him!
He wasn't here.

543
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:54,074
He went out? - Jacques,
please, don't be a hypocrite.

544
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,793
Let's talk before we lose him too.

545
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:00,832
May he have a long life...
- God forbid! Don't say that.

546
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,713
What do you think killed Maurice
if not the pressure and the money?

547
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,912
You don't understand.

548
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,553
You don't appreciate
Haim's situation.

549
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,398
If he the factory closes,
he will be in debt

550
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,397
and will lose everything he has.

551
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,272
Ita will throw him
out and take the girls.

552
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,159
That's why
I called you. Let me talk.

553
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,636
I have an idea. - What?

554
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,837
Look, Jacques, what
did our poor father have?

555
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:25,237
Two shops in the old center.
That's what he left, right? - So?

556
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:28,718
Vivian used one shop for her
beauty salon for a few years,

557
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,108
and gave it back. - Go on.

558
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:32,635
And then Maurice, God rest
his soul, took the two shops

559
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,473
for his business and didn't give
them back. - So? - And he died.

560
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:38,398
Explain already.
- Why are you pressuring me?

561
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,590
I'm trying to explain something.
- Okay, sorry, sorry, go on.

562
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,588
Dad didn't leave a will and Maurice,
rest his soul, took the two shops,

563
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:49,359
and continued working there.
- So what are you trying to say?

564
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:52,836
He has 6 more brothers and 2 sisters.
- Right. - So what are you thinking?

565
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:57,591
Look, as long as things
were going well, we kept quiet.

566
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,957
But now, when there is nothing,
we have to divide it up. - How?

567
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:05,109
We have to talk it over with llana.
- Have you no shame, Meir? - Why?

568
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,513
Is this the time to take away
a widow's only source of income?

569
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,358
Why "only"?
Why "only"?

570
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:13,677
She has Maurice's share
in Ben Lulu's business,

571
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,398
and he'll give her her share.

572
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:18,916
We'll sell the stores
and give the money to Haim.

573
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,793
What are you talking about?
Maurice had nothing with Ben Lulu.

574
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,512
Maurice died penniless.

575
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,238
They don't have a cent to their name.

576
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:28,030
You think llana will continue
living so well?

577
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,549
They'll have to sell this
house too to pay back his debts.

578
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:34,633
How will it look, letting a stranger
look after our brother's widow?

579
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:35,715
Ben Lulu?

580
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,637
- Yes, what's wrong?
Let him take care of her.

581
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,631
Besides, I'm not worried
about that woman.

582
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,432
She'll get her claws
into Ben Lulu herself.

583
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:43,630
You'll see, she won't remain
a widow for very long.

584
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,034
What's he going on about, Meir?

585
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,594
Itamar, if we're already talking,
she really doesn't care about us.

586
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:49,472
What's the matter with you?
That's no way to talk.

587
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,238
She told Maurice
to change their surname.

588
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,868
She didn't want the name
"Ohayon" on her door. Is that nice?

589
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:57,430
She didn't care about the family,
if not for her, he'd still be alive.

590
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:02,031
Don't let anyone hear this. - Okay,
enough. Meir, what are you saying?

591
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,871
I repeat,

592
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:09,119
I'm prepared to give my share of
the shops for the factory, to Haim.

593
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,474
You don't understand.

594
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:13,516
She was left with nothing.

595
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,519
You should be
ashamed of yourselves.

596
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:17,153
If God forbid
something happened to me

597
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,633
that's how you'd care for my wife?

598
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:21,593
If that's the case, then there's no
solution. I don't have any money.

599
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,870
Meir, we are Haim's partners.

600
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:26,156
Partners? I'm a partner?

601
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:27,633
Why, did I get any profits?

602
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,155
Did anyone share
the dividends with me?

603
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,753
I'm an employee, an employee.

604
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,275
And so are you, Meir.
And you, Itamar, an employee.

605
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:38,069
It's not our problem. Haim, he is the
boss. We are just employees. - Right.

606
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:42,432
You forget how much we wanted it,
how we convinced him to join us,

607
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,909
that he invest his money,
his wife's money.

608
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:46,752
Right, he was our boss,

609
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,996
but he treated us like partners.

610
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:50,798
He never told us what to do.

611
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,757
He never asked us to repay him.

612
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,273
We are partners!

613
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:55,589
That's true.

614
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,356
I'm ready to give my house.

615
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:11,278
To give everything I have.
What are you prepared to do?

616
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,192
What do you stand to lose, David?

617
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:15,595
A one bedroom apartment
in Kiryat Yam? - Jacques.

618
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:17,915
What? No, I'm talking brass tacks.

619
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:20,719
What do you stand to lose?
You don't have a wife or kids.

620
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:24,111
What? Are you making fun of us?

621
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,878
And what are you?
A wedding singer.

622
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,434
You worked part time.
You came at 12:00 and left at 16:00.

623
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,909
Now you come and want
to tell us what to do?

624
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,992
Jacques, everyone gave what he could,
and was paid accordingly.

625
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,715
You think you can manage
on your own, right?

626
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:40,749
The factory made us strong.

627
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,871
God help you.

628
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:54,757
David's right.
- David's right?

629
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:56,958
You want to sell your house too?

630
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:59,680
You can also offer
your house and Lilly's store...

631
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,677
What's the matter?
Should we leave him hanging?

632
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:04,953
You want to make me
out to be the bad guy, is that it?

633
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:08,318
Why should I be responsible for a
place where I was just an employee?

634
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:10,749
What are you asking me
to do, Itamar? Live in the street?

635
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:13,474
I finally put a roof over
my family's head at the age of 48.

636
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,875
And now I have to take
a chance? What if it doesn't work,

637
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,309
what if it fails?
What do I do then?

638
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:21,238
It's better only one of us falls,
that way we can help out a bit.

639
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:23,834
We have to help now.
- Itamar, I swear...

640
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:27,635
I'm invested in this
election up to my last shekel.

641
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:32,069
I swear to you on Dad's
grave, I have nothing left.

642
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,756
Where will I go now
with five children,

643
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:38,674
my wife and her poor
sister who won't leave us.

644
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:41,598
May God take her away for us!
- Okay, is that why you called us?

645
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:48,036
It's between you and yourselves.

646
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,435
Only we know
what we have or don't have.

647
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,154
Go call Charlie.

648
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:07,115
Charlie!

649
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:33,319
Meir, the family's in a mess.
We have to straighten it out.

650
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:36,637
You're the eldest, it's your
job. - And who will let me?

651
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,233
I don't know.

652
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:42,837
What's going on?
- Sit down, Charlie.

653
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:47,398
Tell me, Charlie, you were very
close to Maurice the last few years.

654
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:51,077
Tell us, what's his
situation? We're worried.

655
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,239
What exactly are you worried about?

656
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:56,559
How do his affairs concern you?

657
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,517
Did he leave llana anything?

658
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:01,075
He would have told you
himself, if he had wanted to.

659
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,953
Don't be rude!
There are some problems, okay?

660
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:06,640
We need to know what to do with
the shops Maurice took from Dad.

661
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:08,113
I don't know anything.

662
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,834
Don't you hear what
we're saying? Dad's shops.

663
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,951
Don't play dumb.
Answer! The family is in trouble.

664
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:15,116
Leave me alone, Jacques.
I don't know anything.

665
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:18,312
Has this family lost its values?
What's this supposed to mean?

666
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:20,317
Are you doing this
on purpose or what? Tell me.

667
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:24,238
You used to be able to grab me
by the shirt and I'd tremble in fear.

668
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,038
You, and you, Meir.

669
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,629
Lay a finger on me again
and I'll break your bones.

670
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:34,355
Let him go...

671
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,558
The nerve!

672
00:49:58,520 --> 00:49:59,555
Lilly...

673
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,673
What's this I hear...

674
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:09,190
You're selling the house?

675
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,872
What are you talking about, Evelyn?

676
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:13,793
Our house?

677
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:16,158
I'm not selling any house.

678
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:19,833
Who told you that?

679
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,719
No one said anything to me.

680
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:26,112
I'm looking for a house in the area.

681
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:33,679
Your area is nice, right? - Finally,
you're leaving Meir and Thrse.

682
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,879
How much longer
can I go on living there?

683
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:39,598
Right...

684
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,359
Good for you.

685
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,718
Let's go out.
They're waiting for us.

686
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:10,999
Why did you turn it up?

687
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:14,314
Turn the radio off.

688
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:17,473
We have to know what's happening.
I'll turn it down after the news.

689
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,039
But you can't.

690
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:21,913
Turn it off now.
- No.

691
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:23,435
One more minute.

692
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:27,350
It's a matter of life and death.
It's not for our listening pleasure.

693
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:30,034
There's a war going on.
- There's nothing to hear.

694
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:34,071
The minute there's a siren,
it will come on automatically.

695
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:35,719
That's what we need, nothing more.

696
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:39,997
He's right. It's not allowed.

697
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:48,279
"Blessed are You, Lord,
our God, King of the universe,

698
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,710
through whose word everything
comes into being." -Amen.

699
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:01,152
What's wrong, Ruthie?

700
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,115
What's the matter?

701
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,629
You care about the radio
but not about your family.

702
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:10,868
That's the heart, it works one day,
and the next day you're gone, Aaron.

703
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:13,992
No, no, no,
It's not possible.

704
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:18,033
His heart was fine. He stopped
smoking three years ago.

705
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:22,998
How? Why?
- Why? He was at a party...

706
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:27,316
Efi's birthday... - It's a pity
he went to the party.

707
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:29,789
We danced until 04:00.

708
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,959
I wanted to go home,
he said one more drink.

709
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:38,556
He was in a good mood,
he wanted to continue dancing...

710
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:41,191
like that time in Turkey.

711
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,198
What a hotel we had...

712
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:48,553
What luxury, gold faucets,

713
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:51,877
an open bar

714
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:55,478
French, Italian, stir fry

715
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:59,110
in abundance.
- He knew how to pamper himself.

716
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:02,114
Maurice knew how to drink.
He could put away

717
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:06,357
7, 8, 10 shots.

718
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:15,349
Hi, Jacques, is everything all right?

719
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:18,119
My stomach hurts. It's been 2 days
since my last bowel movement.

720
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:20,834
That's what happens when you're
not at home, you get constipated.

721
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:23,713
Do you want a laxative? - No.
My stomach is a mess as it is.

722
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:28,596
How are you? Are you tired, sweetie?
- I barely slept a wink.

723
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:32,033
My love, there are enough people
helping. Lie down, come back later.

724
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,639
No, no, it's okay.

725
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:40,755
Jacques...

726
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:42,349
My heart...

727
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:44,910
My flower...
- This isn't the time.

728
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:48,750
Honey, lately you've been
keeping your distance.

729
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:57,073
You know what I want?

730
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:01,673
To buy you that ring you
had your eye on last year.

731
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,269
This isn't the time to be
wasting money, Jacques.

732
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:07,997
You haven't received
a salary in three months.

733
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:11,310
Honey, if Meir wins these elections

734
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:15,308
everything will be fine. - Why?

735
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,154
What are you planning?

736
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:21,400
I'll work with him.
- And the factory?

737
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:24,359
I don't know Lilly, it's dead.
The factory is dead. - And Haim?

738
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:25,799
We'll see.

739
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:29,034
You think the municipality
will pay as well as Haim did?

740
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:33,435
Baby, there are options in politics.
- Options...

741
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:37,112
What's going on? Evelyn asked
me if we're selling our house?

742
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:39,318
What's that nonsense?

743
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,309
She asked you if we were selling
our house? - Yes.

744
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:45,151
What, you think
it has to do with the factory?

745
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:49,668
Lilly, I suggest you stay
out of it. It's complicated.

746
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:04,793
Baby, God willing, as soon
as this month is finished, you and I

747
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:08,598
will pamper ourselves
at the Princess Hotel in Eilat.

748
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:13,109
You're starting a year's mourning,
this is no time to be partying.

749
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:19,353
Who's partying?
We won't leave the room, my sweet.

750
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:30,473
He died exactly when the weekly
Torah portion spoke of gifts.

751
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:34,429
A man who gave to the poor
his whole life. - That's right.

752
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:35,754
I went and asked the Rabbi...

753
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:39,589
They're not talking.
- Of course they are.

754
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:42,109
You have eyes
but you see nothing.

755
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:44,748
I see just fine.
I have my contact lenses.

756
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:47,275
Hanina, Hanina!

757
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:50,394
What? - What's wrong
with Vivian and Simona?

758
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:52,989
What's wrong? - They're not
talking to each other, are they?

759
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:56,317
No! They are. Why?

760
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:59,119
I don't know.
- Why do you say you don't know?

761
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:01,629
Shut up!
You don't understand anything.

762
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:04,234
I understand very well.
- What? What do you understand?

763
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:07,591
They were hugging
and kissing two days ago...

764
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:08,948
They buried their brother,

765
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:11,071
why shouldn't
they hug and kiss, you fool?

766
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:12,309
I'm a fool?

767
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:18,396
You don't understand anything.
That Simona is a tough cookie.

768
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:22,793
That's enough
talk about my daughters.

769
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:27,829
Enough!
Okay. I'll be quiet.

770
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:29,712
David, did you hear
what happened yesterday?

771
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:33,196
Some poor Yemenite from
the Hatikva neighborhood choked.

772
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:38,110
Really. He put his mask on, left
the plug in and choked to death.

773
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:40,475
God help him, poor soul.

774
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:45,676
I'm telling you they're hitting
us because of the refineries.

775
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:49,829
"Blessed is He who diverts
missiles from their path. - Amen.

776
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:54,912
I wish a missile
would land on the factory!

777
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:58,757
That would fix things, Haim.
You know what that would mean?

778
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:03,194
If there is a God, let it fall.
Not only won't we lose money,

779
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:06,670
you'll end up being
compensated by the government.

780
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:10,110
Why? Does God
do business with you?

781
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:13,719
Really...

782
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:21,873
What's wrong with Ruthie?
- She's difficult, difficult...

783
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,356
That's your solution, Meir?

784
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:34,439
What?

785
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:18,869
Do you want to talk?

786
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:22,554
Why not?

787
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:27,073
I don't want to now.

788
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:35,588
Okay.

789
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:38,634
Whenever you want to.

790
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:43,192
Lock the door.

791
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:49,555
Vivian...

792
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:53,079
Oh, Ben Lulu...
everything's okay.

793
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:09,916
Say I talk to her,
what good will it do?

794
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:15,156
Don't worry,
I'll talk to her today.

795
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:17,311
That's how it is with women.

796
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:20,278
You'll make up today.

797
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:24,193
Meir, you're the eldest,
put some pressure on her.

798
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:25,634
Talk to her.

799
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:32,076
If Maurice was alive,
he'd persuade her.

800
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:37,994
Did it help you when he was alive,
poor soul? - She listened to Maurice.

801
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:41,113
I have one!

802
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:44,749
Maybe you should tell her...

803
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:47,518
that you're prepared to divorce her.

804
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:51,599
That way, you'll slowly start
to talk to one another. Don't worry.

805
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:53,711
The mourning period
in particular

806
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:57,631
is the ideal time to make up.
It's a known fact.

807
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:01,315
Meir, I'll kill myself
but I won't divorce her.

808
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:07,315
I'm not saying you should,
just say that you will.

809
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:09,992
I don't do things that way.

810
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:13,519
Tell her that...

811
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,115
Tell her...

812
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:21,918
Tell her I love her.

813
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:28,429
Okay.

814
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:49,679
Vivian?
- What, Meir?

815
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:51,279
I have to talk to you.

816
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:55,592
Eliahu... is here. - Meir,
I don't want to hear another word.

817
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:57,554
Not a word.

818
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:00,478
Vivian, listen...
- Leave me alone.

819
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:03,353
Please.

820
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:09,789
Exchange a few words with him
and that's it. Nothing more.

821
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:13,390
Why should I talk to him?
- Calm down, let's drink some coffee.

822
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:20,556
I want him to leave...

823
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:28,592
What's going on?
- Everything's fine.

824
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:35,949
You see her...
- Let her be.

825
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:40,633
Let her do what she wants.
- No. I always give in to her.

826
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:43,238
And you know what?
I'm mad at her, too.

827
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:44,873
I'm mad at her too
and she should know it,

828
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,594
and not think she's always right.
- You see how she is with everyone.

829
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:49,950
So what? Am I her slave?
I won't have her

830
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:52,036
always vent her anger on me.
Enough!

831
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:54,352
She always did that,
she'd be mad at someone

832
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:56,391
and would take it out on me.
Enough! I'm fed up.

833
01:01:57,600 --> 01:02:00,160
You're upset now, forget it.
- That's right. - Listen a minute.

834
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:04,998
I don't like her...
I don't like her anymore.

835
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:08,992
I don't love Simona anymore!

836
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:12,993
She knows.

837
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:15,073
What? Who?

838
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,873
Llana.
- What? What does she know?

839
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:21,436
I can tell.
She won't look me in the eyes.

840
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:24,034
Stop it. What kind of nonsense
do you have in your head now?

841
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:28,199
I wish I could disappear.
- Where exactly would you go?

842
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:30,635
I'll tell Jacques I don't feel well.

843
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:32,677
I can't, I don't feel well here.

844
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:35,268
Ilana, the children, his things.

845
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:37,789
It's driving me mad.
- I know.

846
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:39,439
I know, Lilly.

847
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:43,232
I'll tell him when the mourning
period ends. - What will you tell him?

848
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:49,032
That I'm leaving him.
- A lot can happen until then.

849
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:53,594
You know what, go. Go now.

850
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:57,351
Go on, get some rest.
Come back tomorrow.

851
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:14,790
I thought we'd see
more of Ben Lulu.

852
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:20,278
He gets up early for morning
prayers and goes to work...

853
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:22,192
You get up early, too.

854
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:24,749
I get up at 7:00 to come here.

855
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:27,912
Should I get up at 5:00?
- I don't know.

856
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:31,516
The toilet has to be cleaned.
Someone left it dirty.

857
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:33,278
Take the bleach.

858
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:34,914
So I have to clean it?

859
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:37,954
Who will do it?

860
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:44,672
I made a great sauce...

861
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:02,589
Ben Lulu...

862
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:04,153
Excuse me, Evelyn.

863
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:19,159
What's wrong?
- Later.

864
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:26,435
Ben Lulu?

865
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:30,638
How are you?
- Fine.

866
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:32,395
Anis?

867
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:33,873
I'll go serve them.

868
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:36,948
I'm fine.

869
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:41,709
I'm going...

870
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:56,391
My tomato sauce really
came out good this time.

871
01:04:57,640 --> 01:05:00,916
Ben Lulu, would you like a sandwich?
- No thank you, Evelyn, I have to go.

872
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:04,517
Won't you have something
to eat before you go?

873
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:06,669
No thanks.

874
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:08,159
Ben Lulu...

875
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:13,999
I... it's my birthday.
- Oh, congratulations, Evelyn.

876
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:19,109
I'm making a small party
at home in two weeks time.

877
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:22,073
I'd like to invite you.
Will you come?

878
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:26,788
I'll come. Sure, why not?
I'll come. We'll talk later?

879
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:28,717
Sure, sure, later, not now.

880
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:33,960
Okay... congratulations.
- Thank you.

881
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:46,675
So?

882
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:49,908
I invited him.
- Where to?

883
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:51,798
To my birthday party in two weeks.

884
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:54,272
What birthday?

885
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:55,879
What do you want?

886
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:59,356
Should I ask him to invite
me to some fancy restaurant?

887
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:00,589
But it isn't true.

888
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:03,029
We'll make me a birthday party
and we'll invite him, that's all.

889
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:06,072
Sure and Meir is really going
to let you make a party now.

890
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:37,435
What do you want?
- I want to talk to you.

891
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:39,158
We have nothing
to talk about, Eliahu.

892
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:41,794
Soon it'll be Shai's Bar Mitzvah
and I thought... - What?

893
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:45,514
I want you to come back home.

894
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:50,470
I'm not coming back, Eliahu.
- Why not?

895
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:54,596
Living in some dive, like a dog.
- I'm happy where I am.

896
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:58,918
Vivian, I'll do whatever
you want. Come back.

897
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:07,633
I want a divorce. - I'll never give
you a divorce, do you hear? Never.

898
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:09,472
I'll kill myself first, Vivian.

899
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:16,118
Move. Let me go.

900
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:19,158
Vivian, think about it,
you stand to lose everything.

901
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:21,430
What will you gain
by being so stubborn?

902
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:26,192
Look at you. You're not young
anymore, you have 4 children.

903
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:28,749
What do you have to offer?
Nothing.

904
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:30,757
Who will have you?

905
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:38,553
Remember this day, Eliahu.
You'll beg me yet for a divorce.

906
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:42,432
You think I'm looking for a husband?

907
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:46,671
No, I have my work.

908
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:49,075
I have a place to rest
and I have peace of mind.

909
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:51,794
That's all.
I have everything I need.

910
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,399
Everything.

911
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:58,639
I've been waiting for 3 years.

912
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:01,354
3 years!

913
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:08,318
I won't wait much longer. Someone
will come along that I'll like,

914
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:11,631
I'll go with him.
I won't think about you Eliahu.

915
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:13,113
And what will they say about you?

916
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:15,196
A married woman looking for men...

917
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:19,399
If I waited till now, it was only
for your honor, Eliahu, not mine.

918
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:21,755
I couldn't care less what they say.

919
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:25,515
I'll go to movies and to cafes
and the whole world will see

920
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:28,757
and then the shame
will be on you, on you, Eliahu.

921
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:31,314
So if you don't give me a divorce
not only will you lose me,

922
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:33,635
you will also lose
your lousy honor.

923
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:38,078
Mark my words.

924
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:41,679
I never could talk to you.

925
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:45,276
The minute I open
my mouth, you attack.

926
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:48,668
What do you want?
Get out of here, go.

927
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:50,074
What do you want?

928
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:53,035
They'll get along just fine
without you and your grimaces.

929
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:55,435
I don't want to stay here either.

930
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:57,391
No one respects the dead here.
There's no respect for your brother.

931
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:01,399
You're talking about business
and money instead of praying for him.

932
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:03,318
His soul won't get to heaven.

933
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:05,795
It's forbidden, Vivian.
Forbidden.

934
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:07,996
You'll all pay for this.

935
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:10,509
The whole family
will pay for this.

936
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:14,036
What are you talking about? - What?

937
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:16,029
Who's talking about money?

938
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:20,916
Go on, if you don't want
to be here, get out of here.

939
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:22,911
Your brothers
don't deserve my respect.

940
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:25,429
I'll never set foot
in this house again.

941
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:28,830
Don't bother... scaring us.

942
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,355
Go and don't come back!

943
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:33,152
You're cursing me?

944
01:09:33,280 --> 01:09:35,840
Watch your mouth, Vivian.

945
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:39,959
You be careful.
- No, no, you watch yourself.

946
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:42,554
No, you be careful.
- Me? I should be careful?

947
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:45,035
Yes, you.
You be careful.

948
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:47,839
Be careful, be careful.

949
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:50,030
Be careful,
I'm telling you. I mean it.

950
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:52,754
Why, what did I say?

951
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:55,597
Nothing.

952
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:59,392
Nothing, you never say anything.

953
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:04,633
Leave me alone.

954
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:08,432
We'll see what will become of you.

955
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:10,994
We'll see.

956
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:14,633
I'm going home.

957
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:23,753
Poor Maurice.

958
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:24,238
You can say "sorry."

959
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:26,473
I don't feel like it.

960
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:49,158
What do you want from me?

961
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:51,833
What?

962
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:01,832
From the day
we came here, poor Maurice,

963
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:04,520
she hasn't stopped glaring
at me with those eyes of hers,

964
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:06,079
and never says anything.

965
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:11,717
I said to her, "Let's talk",
but she didn't want to.

966
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:15,637
What did I do to her, what?

967
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:19,759
Here, in front of all my brothers,
tell me what you want.

968
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:24,118
She's treated me like this
for 2 years and I said nothing.

969
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:25,309
Nothing!

970
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:27,154
I've had it.

971
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:28,869
I don't want to talk to you.

972
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,877
Just a minute, Vivian,
Simona, what's going on?

973
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:35,073
What's going on? What?
You don't know anything, right?

974
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:38,310
She always finds
opportunities to insult me.

975
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:40,914
If I hurt her, let her
tell me. Let her tell me.

976
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:43,235
I'll get down on my knees
and ask for her forgiveness.

977
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:44,315
Let her tell me.

978
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:46,715
Enough. Make up, hug
each other, end this story.

979
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:48,796
Enough already!

980
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,479
Not that hug again.

981
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:52,795
It's the same old story
every holiday, every occasion.

982
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:54,478
We come, we make up,
we hug, we kiss

983
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:57,916
and then she doesn't
talk to me. What for?

984
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:04,071
For the sake of this mourning
period, for Maurice, his memory.

985
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:07,835
Tell me already what's bothering
you and we'll stop this shit.

986
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:10,870
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

987
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:13,508
Making yourself miserable
in front of everyone.

988
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:16,988
What about you?

989
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:19,432
What are you looking at?

990
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:21,397
You're all hypocrites.

991
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:24,558
What, Meir? Sticking
yourself in my face.

992
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:28,190
Fuck off, all of you!
- Simona!

993
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:30,794
Simona, what?

994
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:32,273
You want to raise your hand to me?

995
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:34,789
Go on, raise your hand.
Be a man. Do you miss it?

996
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:36,757
Did I ever raise
my hand to you? Me?

997
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:39,348
I never raised a hand to you.
- Simona, what is this?

998
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:41,112
You shut up too.

999
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:43,840
I can't stand the sight
of you anymore.

1000
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,195
Now calm down...
- Meir, Meir...

1001
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:48,595
Do you hear me? Enough!
- Don't touch my sister.

1002
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:52,230
I'm not afraid.
I spit on all of you.

1003
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:54,794
Meir, Meir, move.
Let me talk to her quietly.

1004
01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:57,229
Forget it, Haim. Someone
has to set things straight here.

1005
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:59,510
And you're the one who'll do it?
Since when?

1006
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:02,478
Maurice was the only one who
did it before and now he's gone.

1007
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:04,232
Maurice is dead. Gone!

1008
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:06,516
Sure you'll do it...
- Like...

1009
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:09,438
What's wrong with you? Have some
respect for the week of mourning.

1010
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:12,160
Oh no, there she goes again.

1011
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:14,510
Get her out of here.

1012
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:17,871
I don't want to see her anymore.
May God take me...

1013
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:19,877
May God take all of you, amen.

1014
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,911
You should be ashamed.
- What are you doing?

1015
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:23,752
Meir!
- You bastard!

1016
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:27,432
Enough!
What's wrong with you? Meir.

1017
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:30,068
Move. Enough of your nonsense.

1018
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:31,792
Shut up once and for all.

1019
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:34,718
We're fed up with your fits and
your filthy mouth. - You're fed up?

1020
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:37,035
You've had enough?
You'd rather come here and hug,

1021
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:39,720
and kiss, and then give each
other the finger behind your backs?

1022
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:42,308
I say what I have to say up front.
You can blow a fuse, for all I care.

1023
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:44,158
God help us,
what's wrong with you? Enough!

1024
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:45,878
It's not enough!
- Enough! - No, it's not.

1025
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:49,030
When my Micha was alive,
you knew how to come over,

1026
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:51,037
and eat at our expense, drink,

1027
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:52,952
borrow money
you never returned.

1028
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:55,592
You licked his boots.

1029
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:58,479
Now that he's dead,
no one comes anymore.

1030
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:04,233
2 years. No one has set foot
in my house in 2 years.

1031
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:06,748
No one asks,

1032
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:09,198
"Do you need anything, Simona?"

1033
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:11,679
"How are you managing, Simona?

1034
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:14,112
"Do you need any help?"

1035
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:16,152
You forgot my name.

1036
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:21,999
You'll see, llana, in another
week they'll forget you too.

1037
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:25,351
She's right.
None of you ever considered

1038
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:27,476
that maybe she
needed something... nothing.

1039
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:30,478
She was the one who cut off contact.
She didn't want to talk to anyone.

1040
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:32,989
She didn't answer the phone,
nothing. So we gave up.

1041
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:35,918
You don't call in a situation like
that. You get in the car and come.

1042
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:38,156
She's your sister.
- Shut up. You, shut up.

1043
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:40,590
That what know how to do, ah?
To hit and shout...

1044
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:43,154
Where is all this hatred coming
from? What's wrong with you?

1045
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:44,793
Charlie, Simona, shame on you.

1046
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:47,192
All of a sudden your big shots.

1047
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:48,992
Raising your heads.
- You should be ashamed!

1048
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:50,678
You should!

1049
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:52,432
You, Itamar.
And you, Jacques.

1050
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:55,353
Who, if not my Micha,
helped you start your businesses?

1051
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:57,875
You came to him, took
80,000 NIS, it's all written down.

1052
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,797
I still have his notebooks.

1053
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:02,070
Did you pay him back?
Like hell. He never saw a cent.

1054
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:05,272
When he died, Maurice
took over his business, as it was.

1055
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:07,675
With the equipment, his employees.

1056
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:09,358
He promised
to give me 3000 NIS a month.

1057
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:11,829
In the end he paid me for
10 months and then disappeared.

1058
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:14,474
I never heard from him and didn't
see him again until he died.

1059
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:15,999
Ilana, tell me, isn't that true?

1060
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:18,076
He went bankrupt, you know that!

1061
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:20,800
The business fell apart
without Micha. - I'd call him,

1062
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:22,319
he wouldn't return my calls.

1063
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:25,199
Isn't that so, llana?
Tell me, isn't it?

1064
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:28,598
I don't know. I wasn't involved
in Maurice's business affairs.

1065
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:31,118
Okay, enough.

1066
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:34,875
Don't answer her. She's right.
Leave her alone, enough.

1067
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:36,393
You keep quiet.

1068
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:37,709
Shut up.

1069
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:40,189
I can't stand to hear
your voice anymore.

1070
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:43,070
She's crazy.
Simona's gone crazy.

1071
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:45,631
Enough.
- Crazy?

1072
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:48,154
Crazy?

1073
01:16:49,240 --> 01:16:50,389
Crazy with an evil eye.

1074
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:53,196
With a big evil eye.

1075
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:56,198
Oh, you're scared?

1076
01:16:57,400 --> 01:17:00,073
Are you afraid of my evil eye?
Is that why you want me to shut up?

1077
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:02,353
You were always afraid of me.

1078
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:05,272
You were afraid
I'd put a jinx on you.

1079
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:07,874
You were afraid I'd put
an evil eye on your children.

1080
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:12,594
You were always afraid of me.
You were afraid I was jealous.

1081
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:15,759
Of what?

1082
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:17,438
Of what, Simona?

1083
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:21,670
Of what?
My shitty life with Eliahu?

1084
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:25,839
You always had more than me
and I was happy for you.

1085
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:29,435
The coat she bought
in New York for $100,

1086
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:31,636
3 years after she wore
it every single day,

1087
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:34,516
she wanted to sell
it to me for $150.

1088
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:40,669
She would've given it to a stranger
but no, she wanted to insult me,

1089
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:42,916
to say she hates me. Why? Why?

1090
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:47,878
For no reason. Just like that.
I don't love you anymore.

1091
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:50,635
I don't love anyone.

1092
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:56,434
Why do I have to love you?
Why? Because you're my brothers?

1093
01:17:57,240 --> 01:17:58,912
Is it a law?

1094
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:01,395
And what if I don't love you anymore?
What will I do then?

1095
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:07,276
Simona, don't talk like that,
it's not nice. - You shut up.

1096
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:10,915
How many times did you come to me
and ask for help to tide you over?

1097
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:15,232
Okay, shut up, shut up. There's
only so much we can listen to.

1098
01:18:16,040 --> 01:18:19,396
You also turned your nose
up at us with all your money.

1099
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:21,755
There's no more money. No more!

1100
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:24,832
Don't make yourself out to be poor.
Micha provided for you for life.

1101
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,956
You lack for nothing.
- That's what you think.

1102
01:18:27,080 --> 01:18:28,479
You're doing Maurice an injustice.

1103
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:30,750
How did Micha get started
if not with Maurice's help?

1104
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:33,189
You forget. You've all forgotten.

1105
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:35,271
And Micha repaid him
with compound interest.

1106
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:37,556
Simona, he didn't get
the business as a gift.

1107
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:40,114
He paid 100,000 NIS for it.

1108
01:18:40,240 --> 01:18:42,879
He paid you until it folded.
Did you expect him to keep paying you

1109
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,434
out of his own pocket
after the business failed?

1110
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:47,152
He was up
to his neck in debt, tell her.

1111
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:49,157
If Ben Lulu hadn't offered
Maurice to work with him

1112
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:51,191
we would have nothing
to eat. Shame on you.

1113
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:53,794
All of a sudden you do know
about Maurice's business affairs.

1114
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:58,477
You... you killed my brother.

1115
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:01,999
With your demands, your requests,

1116
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:05,597
your shopping.
You were never satisfied.

1117
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:09,230
Nothing was enough. You wanted
more and more until he collapsed.

1118
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:11,590
Shut up! Don't talk like
that about my mother.

1119
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:13,631
You shut up.
Who do you think raised you?

1120
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:15,279
Who wiped your ass?
Your mother?

1121
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:18,073
I did everything in this house
while she sat with her legs crossed.

1122
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:20,794
For years I waited on her,
like a maid, for no money.

1123
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:23,235
Out of my house!
Get her out of my house!

1124
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:24,634
Get out!
- Mother...

1125
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:27,718
Haim, Meir, David,
get her out of here.

1126
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:29,472
Ilana, calm down, enough.

1127
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:32,837
Thrse, bring her a glass of water.
Enough! You've gone too far!

1128
01:19:33,640 --> 01:19:35,153
I'll go...

1129
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:38,909
I'll sit at home.
I'll mourn him in my house.

1130
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:41,719
You're not leaving here.
- Don't tell her what to do.

1131
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:44,314
She'll do as she pleases.
- You have a mouth, huh?

1132
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:48,197
Who asked you?
Show some respect for your family.

1133
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:49,992
Look who's talking.
You're one to talk about respect.

1134
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:51,314
If you had a bit
of respect for your family,

1135
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:52,873
you wouldn't want
to take the two shops

1136
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,069
from your brother's widow.

1137
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:58,712
Do I want them for myself?

1138
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:01,309
It's for Haim.

1139
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,353
For the plant.

1140
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:05,233
To help Haim.

1141
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:09,199
You want to sell the shops?

1142
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:11,757
Did I ask you for anything?

1143
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:14,396
The shops aren't even ours.

1144
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:17,398
You think I would take
Maurice's shops from llana?

1145
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:19,638
I don't want anything from you!

1146
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:22,953
Let everyone look after himself.
- Until now you took care of them.

1147
01:20:23,080 --> 01:20:25,435
Why shouldn't they take care
of you now? - Ita, keep quiet.

1148
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:28,154
It's my money,
I have the right to talk.

1149
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:29,753
It's my family's money.

1150
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:31,313
Okay, that's why you were in charge

1151
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:33,317
but they worked
and were paid a salary.

1152
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:36,113
Thrse, you can't buy a house
in 3 years on an employee's salary,

1153
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:37,912
and go abroad twice a year.

1154
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:41,197
Honey, I broke 2 savings
programs to build my house.

1155
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:42,355
Don't make me laugh.

1156
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:45,398
The reparations my mother got
from Germany paid for this factory.

1157
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:48,318
Okay, but you did what
you wanted to with your money.

1158
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:50,198
No one asked, no one forced you.

1159
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:51,958
She's right.
You're right.

1160
01:20:52,120 --> 01:20:54,475
It was our decision
and our responsibility.

1161
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:55,953
It was yours, Haim.

1162
01:20:56,120 --> 01:20:57,553
It's your responsibility.

1163
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:01,118
You're forgetting
where you were before...

1164
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:03,959
you're forgetting.

1165
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:07,995
Your brother came, raised you,
opened a plant for the family.

1166
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:10,839
Look at you, three years later.

1167
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:12,996
Ita, with all due respect,
Haim opened the plant for himself

1168
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:14,712
because he wanted to,
and not for anyone else.

1169
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:17,308
Excuse me, just a minute, you
think you don't have to help now

1170
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:19,795
when the plant is failing?
Help your brother the way he...

1171
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:21,835
helped you?

1172
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,638
What do you know, Ita?

1173
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:30,431
Why do you always
think you know everything?

1174
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:35,714
We discussed it amongst
ourselves and made some decisions.

1175
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:43,313
I'm selling my house, okay?

1176
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:49,197
And I suggest we stop talking about
this now, it's really not the place.

1177
01:21:56,680 --> 01:21:58,432
Is anyone else selling their house?

1178
01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:08,753
I'm selling my house.

1179
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:13,918
Anyone else?

1180
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:18,393
Thrse, are you selling?
Are you selling?

1181
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:22,470
Lilly? Jacques? - Ruthie...

1182
01:22:22,640 --> 01:22:24,153
Are you selling?
- Calm down, okay?

1183
01:22:24,280 --> 01:22:25,918
We don't need you
to add to all this now.

1184
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:28,110
I'm not selling my house, okay?

1185
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:33,632
I'm not selling my house.

1186
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:37,672
You see, Itamar?

1187
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:41,757
They know how to look after
their families. - Ruthie, enough.

1188
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:44,918
No, not enough.
- Stop it, Ruthie, stop it.

1189
01:22:45,080 --> 01:22:47,594
Don't worry,
I won't let you sell the house.

1190
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:49,910
I won't let anyone
here sell their house.

1191
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:51,314
No one has to worry.

1192
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:55,436
Ita, Ita, Ita!

1193
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:57,397
I've already lost my money.

1194
01:22:57,520 --> 01:23:00,830
But I won't let you take
my uncle's reparations.

1195
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:04,430
They're losing a house, he lost
his whole family in Germany.

1196
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:07,273
This is all he has left.
- Ita, please...

1197
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:10,034
He did you a favor.
He loaned you the money.

1198
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:12,430
And you have to pay
him back every last cent!

1199
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:14,636
It's only money, Ita, only money.

1200
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:18,719
Only money?
Look at you. Only money...

1201
01:23:21,560 --> 01:23:24,472
I'll pay it back, Ita.
- Where will you get the money?

1202
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:26,830
From the houses you
mortgaged without telling me?

1203
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,513
From your brothers?

1204
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:31,108
From the failing plant?
How will you pay him back?

1205
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:36,278
Everything will be okay, my sweet.

1206
01:23:36,440 --> 01:23:38,112
Please, calm down.

1207
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:40,119
Calm down.

1208
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:44,313
Leave me alone!
- Ita! Ita!

1209
01:23:49,320 --> 01:23:52,153
Look, Itamar is selling
his house to save his brother.

1210
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:54,954
You're the eldest, Meir.
You should set an example.

1211
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:58,789
Why are you laughing?
Why are you laughing?

1212
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:00,114
If you had acted like the eldest

1213
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:01,434
you would have taken
the responsibility from Maurice

1214
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:03,278
and then maybe things
would have been easier for him.

1215
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:07,552
What do you want from me?
Thrse, they want to kill me.

1216
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:15,317
Maurice always had more than me,

1217
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:17,876
so he took things
into his own hands.

1218
01:24:18,040 --> 01:24:19,871
I didn't mind.

1219
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:24,437
You always showed him
respect and ignored me.

1220
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:27,313
Even Dad, God rest his soul.

1221
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:28,714
Dad never raised his hand.

1222
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:32,470
Did I ever raise
my hand for no reason?

1223
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:35,518
It was to educate!

1224
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:40,479
I hit you because I loved you.

1225
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:45,031
Everything I did,
I did for your own good.

1226
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:48,349
You were my little brothers...

1227
01:24:56,560 --> 01:25:00,109
Happy now? Shame on you. This is
the respect you show your brother?

1228
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:03,712
If you had any honor, you would give
something of what you have to Haim.

1229
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:08,118
Look at David. He has nothing
and he's giving. He is honorable.

1230
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:09,594
First become a father.

1231
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:12,832
Then talk to me about honor.
- Shut up...

1232
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:16,189
Charlie!

1233
01:25:16,640 --> 01:25:18,198
Charlie!

1234
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:24,358
Jacques, leave him alone.

1235
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:26,315
Go away...

1236
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:40,349
Hold him, ltmar.
- Stop it, already. Stop it.

1237
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:43,274
Enough, enough!

1238
01:25:46,640 --> 01:25:47,789
What's wrong with you?

1239
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:50,436
Did I ask for anything?

1240
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:53,874
Did I?
I don't want anything from you.

1241
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:56,954
I don't want anything, God forbid,
what's the matter with you?

1242
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:58,712
Is this any way to behave?

1243
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:04,519
What was in the past is dead.
What I gave, I gave out of love.

1244
01:26:04,680 --> 01:26:07,717
That's it, it's finished. I don't
want anything from you. Nothing.

1245
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:10,352
You should be ashamed of yourselves.

1246
01:26:23,160 --> 01:26:24,479
I hate you.

1247
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:31,197
It's all your fault. Why did
you have to open your mouth?

1248
01:26:39,720 --> 01:26:40,994
Llana, where are you going?

1249
01:26:41,160 --> 01:26:44,709
I'm going to my room and as far as
I'm concerned, you can all go home.

1250
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:47,192
That's no way to talk, llana.

1251
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:03,750
What... is that the siren?
- Quiet.

1252
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:08,675
The siren! The siren!
- Mother, mother!

1253
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:10,313
Mother!

1254
01:27:22,040 --> 01:27:23,268
Where's my mask?

1255
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:28,239
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

1256
01:27:30,280 --> 01:27:35,354
Don't be scared, don't be scared.
- Mother, where'd you put your mask?

1257
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:04,995
Itamar!

1258
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:29,879
Itamar!

1259
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:39,274
Open up!

1260
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:14,119
What can I say?

1261
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:17,075
Some vacation
you arranged for me.

1262
01:29:26,760 --> 01:29:28,751
You can't stay here, llana.

1263
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:30,313
There are people downstairs.

1264
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:32,433
I don't want to come down.

1265
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:37,388
They're asking for you. What should
we say? - Whatever you want.

1266
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:41,635
What's wrong?
Is everything all right?

1267
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:47,876
Llana, what's wrong, sweetie?
- I'm not coming downstairs.

1268
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:51,075
Why, llana?
- Leave her alone, David.

1269
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:55,150
I want Simona to leave my house.

1270
01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:57,510
What do you mean, "my house"?
There's no "my house" now.

1271
01:29:57,640 --> 01:30:00,473
You'll get your house back
when the week of mourning ends.

1272
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:03,956
I won't sit in the same room with
Simona. - You have no choice.

1273
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:08,792
What will you do? Force me?
Drag me down the stairs?

1274
01:30:08,920 --> 01:30:11,354
Leave her alone, she'll calm
down and she'll come downstairs.

1275
01:30:11,480 --> 01:30:14,392
I won't calm down and I won't come
down. - Ilana, poor Simona,

1276
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:17,199
What do you want
from her? She meant no harm.

1277
01:30:17,320 --> 01:30:20,437
You know her. - She meant
every word. And so did you.

1278
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:23,356
I know you think
exactly like Simona.

1279
01:30:23,480 --> 01:30:26,313
That I killed Maurice
with my demands. Right?

1280
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:29,517
That's what you think.
- God forbid. Who said that?

1281
01:30:29,640 --> 01:30:30,993
Heaven forbid.
Who ever said that?

1282
01:30:31,120 --> 01:30:34,112
Don't think about it. It was a slip
of the tongue on Simona's part.

1283
01:30:34,280 --> 01:30:36,350
Don't think about it.

1284
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:40,117
Okay, okay, I'll come down.
I'll honor the guests.

1285
01:30:41,680 --> 01:30:44,319
And at night I'll sleep in my room
and nobody dare say a word.

1286
01:30:45,480 --> 01:30:47,391
That's the respect
you're showing Maurice?

1287
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:51,120
How dare you
talk to me about respect?

1288
01:30:52,960 --> 01:30:55,679
Enough, leave her. Let everyone
do whatever they want and that's it.

1289
01:31:07,640 --> 01:31:08,709
Ben Lulu...

1290
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:13,960
Would you like something to eat?
- Yes, if you have anything.

1291
01:31:14,160 --> 01:31:19,553
Yes, there's rice
with... peas on the stove.

1292
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:35,676
You're not at work today?
- I had to come.

1293
01:31:38,760 --> 01:31:39,715
How are they?

1294
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:44,749
Not great.

1295
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:49,519
And you, Vivian?
How are you?

1296
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:54,279
I'm fine.

1297
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:00,438
Good...

1298
01:32:01,880 --> 01:32:03,199
I'm going to them.

1299
01:32:04,360 --> 01:32:05,759
Do you want something to eat?

1300
01:32:56,040 --> 01:32:57,712
I can't take it anymore...

1301
01:32:58,320 --> 01:33:03,189
I can't carry on.

1302
01:33:03,440 --> 01:33:04,998
I can't...

1303
01:33:05,160 --> 01:33:06,593
Lilly...

1304
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:09,670
I can't stay in this house
any longer.

1305
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:26,828
Hi, llana.

1306
01:33:31,160 --> 01:33:32,798
Do you need anything?

1307
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:34,996
I'd love a cup of coffee, thanks.

1308
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:44,829
Sugar?
- Two teaspoons...

1309
01:34:03,160 --> 01:34:04,912
He loved to sit
here every morning.

1310
01:34:06,320 --> 01:34:08,754
We would drink coffee together...

1311
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:18,395
How are the boys?

1312
01:34:21,240 --> 01:34:24,550
Holed up in their rooms. - Yes.

1313
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:33,351
I have to go.

1314
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,514
I have to go too.
The children are waiting for me.

1315
01:34:38,720 --> 01:34:39,675
Lilly...

1316
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:43,113
Maurice didn't love you.

1317
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:51,479
Why do you say that?

1318
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:54,633
Because I know.

1319
01:35:21,880 --> 01:35:23,074
Simona...

1320
01:35:33,440 --> 01:35:34,919
Do you want?

1321
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:36,755
No.

1322
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:45,194
Vivian...

1323
01:35:48,120 --> 01:35:49,348
Are you all right?

1324
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:56,035
Yes.

1325
01:36:05,440 --> 01:36:06,714
Simona...

1326
01:36:09,040 --> 01:36:10,075
I love you.

1327
01:36:11,280 --> 01:36:12,269
Why?

1328
01:36:12,680 --> 01:36:13,749
Because you're my sister.

1329
01:36:57,880 --> 01:36:58,949
Mother...

1330
01:37:00,280 --> 01:37:01,474
What's wrong?

1331
01:37:04,760 --> 01:37:05,795
Mother.

1332
01:37:09,960 --> 01:37:11,393
Do you want something?

1333
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:15,719
What's wrong with you?

1334
01:37:18,040 --> 01:37:19,393
Huh?

1335
01:37:19,920 --> 01:37:20,875
Mother?

1336
01:38:29,960 --> 01:38:34,431
If only you were here...

1337
01:38:38,200 --> 01:38:42,751
If only the phone would ring, I'd
answer, my son, and hear your voice.

1338
01:38:55,400 --> 01:38:58,756
Who will look after me?

1339
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:03,954
Who will ask me
is there and news, Mom?

1340
01:39:08,600 --> 01:39:14,550
"Shiva"
Seven Days
