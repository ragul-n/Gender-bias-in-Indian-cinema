1
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,191
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen!

2
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,428
I'm honoured to be a part ofthis..

3
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,558
..World Peace Festival.

4
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,259
All of us understand
the concept of power.

5
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:24,603
Recently, a close friend of mine

6
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,695
explained an
excellent concept to me.

7
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,600
Soft power.

8
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,003
If power needs to be compared..

9
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:33,471
..then analyse this.

10
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,681
In 2034..

11
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:37,275
..our population..

12
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,040
..will exceed China.

13
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:51,029
We have nuclear power.

14
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:52,791
Our army..

15
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,493
..is listed among the
top 5 armies in the world.

16
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:09,274
In lndia..

17
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:11,110
..every month..

18
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:13,782
..around 15 million
cellphones are sold.

19
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:24,224
Soft power.

20
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:26,856
Yoga, Gandhi.

21
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,633
Shah Rukh Khan, Amitabh Bachchan.

22
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:31,761
Ayurved, Basmati rice.

23
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,236
Tandoori Chicken.

24
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,335
The list is long.

25
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:40,541
Soft power is beyond
power politics and money.

26
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:42,615
It's an identity.

27
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,817
India's heritage..

28
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:48,443
..is attracting the
entireworld to herself.

29
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:51,287
This is our soft power.

30
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:54,216
And it is not dependent
upon any fluctuation..

31
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:55,988
..is independent of the
fluctuations ofthe stock market.

32
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:51,841
Three unknown suicide bombers..

33
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:53,536
..in Wuppertal, Germany..

34
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:56,008
..mocked the level three security.

35
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:57,574
And during the bombings..

36
00:06:57,717 --> 00:06:58,877
..in Wuppertal, Germany..

37
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:02,454
..Indian Home Minister Mr.
Manohar Kamat had a heart attack.

38
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:05,056
He has been admitted
at AllMS in New Delhi.

39
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:07,182
And the condition is critical.

40
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:09,355
Sharma.

41
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:11,322
Heart attack!

42
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:16,428
I'm Menon.

43
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,535
I'm taking over.

44
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:22,472
Hi, I'm Pandey.
I'm senior.. - Okay.

45
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:24,504
Let's get to work.

46
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,941
Tell mewhat's going on?

47
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:28,137
Out ofthe three faces,
one man is ours.

48
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:30,579
AgentArjun Sahu.

49
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:33,647
Like Arjun, the other two are..

50
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:36,381
..experienced and senior agents..

51
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:39,790
..with the ClA, MOSSAD.

52
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,254
Like Arjun, they
too were kidnapped..

53
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:46,722
And the forensics found
from the debris of the car..

54
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,198
..shows us that..

55
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:50,061
..they..

56
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:55,670
..were underthe influence
ofsome sophisticated drugs.

57
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:57,341
Any updates from AllMS?

58
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:04,172
This is a kind of exotic virus.

59
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:05,944
Rare.

60
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:07,178
Very rare.

61
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:09,848
Wewill need more time.
Atleast twenty four hours.

62
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:11,856
You have onlyten hours.

63
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:15,523
In my opinion, Wuppertal bombing..

64
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:20,660
..was just to infect
our Home minister.

65
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:23,725
The odd thing is that if..

66
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:27,465
..that was the sole motive,
they could've done it discreetly.

67
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:29,966
Someone is taunting us that..

68
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:33,705
..I'm more powerful than you!

69
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:35,874
Recap. Point no. 1.

70
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:39,941
Level 3 security is the
world's most stringent security..

71
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:43,146
..he cut through
it so easilythat..

72
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:46,151
..its laughable. Point no. 2.

73
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:48,216
Our minister..

74
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:50,192
..has been infected by a virus..

75
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:51,627
..an unknown virus.

76
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:56,724
India's top scientists are unable
to even identify its name. Sad!

77
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,700
Behind all this..

78
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:01,432
..is a man who is..

79
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,838
..not going to..

80
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:05,911
..do it anything discreetly
becausethat's not his personality.

81
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,411
His personality is such that..

82
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,539
..hewill devour level 3 security..

83
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:13,778
..and not even burp.

84
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:18,920
He has opened up a shop of
all kinds of biological virus.

85
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,257
A special virus to kill Arabs.

86
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,521
Another virus to suck
the life out of Jews.

87
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:26,598
It's unbelievable.
-Sir, it's an emergency.

88
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,532
What's going on?
What's the problem?

89
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:32,429
Why is everyone standing?

90
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:35,473
Get back to your station! Sonali,
move out ofmyway!

91
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:44,473
Whatthe hell is going on? Move!

92
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,518
The system is going to
crash any moment. What's..

93
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:58,255
Viirus.

94
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:14,345
system is back.

95
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:19,110
Doctor.

96
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:38,693
What is operation White Tiger?

97
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,800
Two years back, we..

98
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:48,311
..had sent our man to Paris.

99
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:53,370
So..

100
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:54,537
..that was our job?

101
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:56,080
That's what we do.

102
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,646
I will tell you..

103
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,781
..that we had to
build his reputation.

104
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:04,145
His first operation was Paris.

105
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:08,157
After Paris, therewas
activity in Sudan and then we..

106
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:10,051
..had to send him to Sudan.

107
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:36,720
You have to kill Al-Mehmood.

108
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:39,582
He's the most dreaded lSl Agent.

109
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:42,092
And afterthis assignment..

110
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:44,228
..you will gain such notoriety..

111
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,760
..Doctor himselfwill
come looking for you.

112
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,061
Azaan, it's said that..

113
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,767
..that the hand of
Allah protects you.

114
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:53,700
You need it.

115
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:09,539
Thatwas it.

116
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:10,973
Hewas set.

117
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:13,116
They sniffed him out.

118
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:14,710
Then..

119
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:16,351
..Algeria.

120
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,196
Who is..

121
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,242
..Azaan Khan?

122
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:52,483
Sir!

123
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:55,757
Look at that?

124
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:58,329
Wow! What a crisp shirt!

125
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:03,768
You must've heard about the
London bombings this morning.

126
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:09,337
A Muslim patriot!Huh

127
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,639
National Defense Academy's..

128
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:15,046
..gold medalist.

129
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:18,581
In the London Bombing's suspect
list, there's just one lndian name.

130
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:21,618
Aman Khan.

131
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:24,619
Patriot gold medalist..

132
00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:28,352
..Azaan Khan's younger brother.

133
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:30,988
This is not possible. Impossible!

134
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,621
Hey, Sharma!

135
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:35,796
This younger brother..

136
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,903
..how did heturn out to
be such a big terrorist?

137
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:39,766
A terrorist's brother aterrorist.

138
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:42,370
Since when are you
operating your sleeper cell?

139
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,469
Sharma..

140
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:48,876
This guy..

141
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:51,643
..should win an oscar
for his performance.

142
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:53,145
What a..

143
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:57,450
..facade of innocence!

144
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:01,155
What is it, Lieutenant?

145
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,921
Such a big secret..

146
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,363
..you've managed to hide
it verywell, isn't it?

147
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,194
Your mother is an lndian.

148
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:12,136
But your father was an Afghani.

149
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:16,830
And sir has spent the
first 11 years of his life..

150
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,468
..in his country.

151
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:21,102
Yes, I had..

152
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,143
..forgotten.

153
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:26,274
I had forgotten.

154
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:29,751
Afghanistan.

155
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,316
Do you know the difference
between Yashoda and Devki?

156
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:38,953
This land has nurtured me.

157
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:41,256
And lndia is my country.

158
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,632
Is Aman alive?

159
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,002
Azaan believes so.

160
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,014
Drink some water.

161
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:05,614
Aman.

162
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:09,223
Your Aman..

163
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:11,628
..has disappeared
after the London bombing.

164
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:13,391
What evidence do you
have against Aman?

165
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:14,727
Evidence?

166
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:17,166
What is that?

167
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:20,633
He must have already
been issued aticket.

168
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:22,263
Directly to Guantanomo

169
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:23,807
Oneway.

170
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:27,178
ClA interpol.

171
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:29,679
FBl, Ml-6, MOSSAD.

172
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,847
All ofthem are
looking for him desperately.

173
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:34,111
This is all a lie!

174
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:37,178
Neither was Aman
concerned with god..

175
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:39,290
..nor a mosque or a madrassa.

176
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:41,552
He had only one dream.

177
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:43,321
Oxford.

178
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:45,124
He has worked really
hard to get there.

179
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:46,697
Whywill he become a terrorist?

180
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,790
Because your father taught him that.

181
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,630
What are you staring at?

182
00:17:57,976 --> 00:17:59,375
Don't you feel like hitting me?

183
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,038
Why not?

184
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:02,906
Here.

185
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:04,107
Hit me!

186
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:06,907
Hit me!

187
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:11,545
Just as I thought.

188
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:13,589
Coward!

189
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:17,326
Mumma's boy!

190
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:24,494
Congratulations!

191
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:27,094
Good job. Really, great!

192
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:31,775
You guys have broken every
known protocol in the book.

193
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:33,037
So..

194
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,845
..both ofyou are on the line.

195
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,943
Look, why is it so
difficult to understand?

196
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:41,075
Azaan was our best option!

197
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:48,250
Their language,
culturewas in his blood.

198
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:50,858
And even if it hadn't been so..

199
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,261
..even then his
fervour was enough for us.

200
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:55,123
Reports have come that..

201
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:57,468
..Aman is in Waziristan.

202
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:01,366
But what can we do.

203
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,839
Nothing at all. And anyway..

204
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:05,603
..whywill the lndian government..

205
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:07,906
..bother about an
Afghani terrorist?

206
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,410
I can do anything to find Aman.

207
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:12,908
Look..

208
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:14,110
The intention is..

209
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:15,277
..really noble but..

210
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:16,581
..don't be a fool.

211
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,458
Hitting me in this
room as onething.

212
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:22,822
But that place is different.

213
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:24,555
That place is a land ofwar.

214
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:28,097
Where your kith and
kin are less human..

215
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:32,668
..and more animal.

216
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:33,896
There..

217
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:35,734
..you will witness aworld..

218
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:37,341
..that will make your blood boil.

219
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:40,172
You might save every inch
of your bodythere but..

220
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:44,680
..your soul will be dead..

221
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:48,617
..that you will never be
ableto hide or heal it.

222
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,085
Think about it.

223
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:51,649
Wiill you be able to do it?

224
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,550
It is said that I have
Allah's hand protecting me.

225
00:19:57,262 --> 00:20:00,254
For your sake, dear
Sharma and Pandey.

226
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:02,364
I really hope..

227
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:03,761
..that..

228
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:05,460
..he has the hand of
Allah protecting him.

229
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:27,415
I think they are planning
something very big in Europe.

230
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:28,945
Thank you.

231
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:39,193
He is my best customer.
Always pays me big money.

232
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:43,528
Sir Omar.

233
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:46,432
Hello, how are you?

234
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,030
Good.

235
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:50,573
Thank god. Good.

236
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:54,710
Tell me, who do you have for me?

237
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:57,641
I will give you my best man.

238
00:21:57,749 --> 00:21:58,977
I will haveto test him!

239
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:01,882
But you never tested
any of my men before.

240
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,817
I didn't have a
job likethis before.

241
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:06,189
Where will I find him?

242
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:07,883
Waziristan.

243
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,221
Waziristan.

244
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:11,953
Very pleased!

245
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:13,864
Nice meeting you.

246
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:10,712
Have you ever met him?

247
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:12,514
Who?

248
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:13,850
Who? The Doctor.

249
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:18,194
I had the honour of
talking to him once on the phone.

250
00:23:18,296 --> 00:23:19,388
When?

251
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:20,829
Just before London bombings.

252
00:23:20,932 --> 00:23:22,957
London? Doctor!

253
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:24,865
Who did you think
masterminded the bombings? Osama?

254
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:56,928
What's going on?

255
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:04,236
He is ready now.

256
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,064
I tortured him for three days.

257
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:15,142
He is a tough cookie(guy).

258
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:21,115
He's ready then.

259
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:38,333
He'll bethere in two days.

260
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:41,366
Good luck!

261
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:04,092
Quiet!

262
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:07,159
Keep him talking.

263
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:09,767
Track the call, people. C'mon!

264
00:26:13,204 --> 00:26:14,432
Are you alive?

265
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:16,001
They're sending me
to Poland(Krakow).

266
00:26:16,107 --> 00:26:18,302
Azaan, lndia is under attack.

267
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,934
We don't have much time.

268
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:21,272
Thethreat is biological.

269
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:22,880
It's a virus.

270
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,910
Azaan, Sharma here.

271
00:26:30,221 --> 00:26:31,848
The man called Doctor..

272
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:34,458
..we'veto stop him
at any cost. -Aman!

273
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:37,722
We havetraced Sofiya in Paris.

274
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:18,996
Please sit down.

275
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:32,947
Your brother is dead.

276
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:37,287
I was called to identify the body.

277
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:39,557
Height 172 cms.

278
00:27:40,258 --> 00:27:41,623
O positive.

279
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,523
I said that he is Aman Khan.

280
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:50,866
They accepted.

281
00:27:54,105 --> 00:27:57,472
I'm not interested in
being a terrorist's girlfriend.

282
00:27:58,543 --> 00:27:59,908
I was tired!

283
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:03,080
Forthe past two years, l
have been looking for Aman.

284
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:06,676
I don't believethat he is guilty.

285
00:28:06,985 --> 00:28:09,112
Whether you accept it or not..

286
00:28:09,254 --> 00:28:11,279
..the Aman thatwe loved..

287
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:12,822
..is dead.

288
00:28:15,126 --> 00:28:16,821
He has chosen his path.

289
00:28:17,328 --> 00:28:18,590
Forget him.

290
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:24,127
Anyway, you won't be
ableto look for him.

291
00:28:24,736 --> 00:28:26,260
It's god's will..

292
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:28,566
..that wewill
cross paths once again.

293
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:34,746
"May I get a letter of blessings."

294
00:28:35,413 --> 00:28:38,871
"By saying.."

295
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:44,951
"..god's name."

296
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:51,888
"May I get the
salutation ofkindness."

297
00:28:52,697 --> 00:28:56,599
"By saying.."

298
00:28:57,001 --> 00:29:01,199
"..Bismillah."

299
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:14,541
"Bismillah."

300
00:29:14,652 --> 00:29:17,985
"Bismillah."

301
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:21,456
"Bismillah."

302
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:24,187
"Bismillah."

303
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:28,132
"lt started with your name."

304
00:29:28,233 --> 00:29:32,033
"ltwill end with your name."

305
00:29:32,137 --> 00:29:35,038
"Bismillah."

306
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:38,965
"Bismillah."

307
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:42,511
"Bismillah."

308
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:45,377
"Bismillah."

309
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:49,417
"Difficulties became easier."

310
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:52,490
"All the obstacles
have been removed."

311
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:58,859
"Oh god!"

312
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:03,093
"Oh god!"

313
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:06,170
"Oh god"

314
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:10,430
"The ray of hope got lit."

315
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:14,000
"Hope grew within."

316
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:20,779
"May I get your embrace."

317
00:30:21,085 --> 00:30:23,986
"May I get your embrace."

318
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:28,047
"By saying Bismillah."

319
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,424
"Bismillah."

320
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:35,056
"Bismillah."

321
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:38,260
"Bismillah."

322
00:30:38,403 --> 00:30:41,031
"Bismillah."

323
00:30:50,081 --> 00:30:51,981
Come up to the terrace, brother!

324
00:32:19,337 --> 00:32:20,634
Imad.

325
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:39,074
I am Malak

326
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:42,385
So you can throw a punch ortwo.

327
00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:43,613
Fine.

328
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:46,050
But show us what you came here for.

329
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:54,860
How good are you at
blowing things up?

330
00:34:39,944 --> 00:34:41,002
Good.

331
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:44,370
But you will just
have 45 seconds there.

332
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:28,422
But whatever it is..

333
00:35:29,093 --> 00:35:30,890
..you taught the foreigner a lesson.

334
00:35:31,028 --> 00:35:32,222
Are you a Pakistani?

335
00:35:33,664 --> 00:35:35,461
Yes. And you? -Afghani.

336
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:40,069
What are you doing here?

337
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,868
You're very
direct in your questions.

338
00:35:45,943 --> 00:35:47,205
I'm..

339
00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:49,245
..a suicide bomber.

340
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:51,178
I came here to
become a terrorist. Evil!

341
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:54,508
The madness ofjihad was driving me.

342
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,920
So I came hereto sacrifice myself.

343
00:35:58,956 --> 00:36:00,787
Things that I could
never understand myself.

344
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:03,025
I came hereto teach others.

345
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:05,261
Destiny got me here.

346
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:08,260
Now, what is right or wrong..

347
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:11,329
..whosefight is it? And
which fools are fighting?

348
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:13,027
What difference does it maketo me?

349
00:36:13,571 --> 00:36:15,038
This war and jihad..

350
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:16,538
..right and wrong..

351
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:18,904
..I have made a cocktail
out ofit and gulped it down.

352
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:23,213
But what's with you?

353
00:36:23,648 --> 00:36:25,775
Looking at you, seems like..

354
00:36:25,883 --> 00:36:29,080
..you're very sad within.

355
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:31,679
What difference does it make?

356
00:36:31,789 --> 00:36:33,723
No problems. It's said that..

357
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:35,949
..ifyou save an innocent man..

358
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:38,494
..it amounts to saving
the entire mankind.

359
00:36:39,263 --> 00:36:42,664
Let it be said, one
day I will save you.

360
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:53,866
You wait here.

361
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:51,859
Anybodythere?

362
00:39:46,016 --> 00:39:47,506
Bad lift!

363
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,355
Check your computer.

364
00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:02,629
Threat is real.

365
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:06,803
Activate interpol.

366
00:40:09,373 --> 00:40:11,398
The packet is clean.

367
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:27,486
Sir, what you're
about to see is very..

368
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:29,752
..disturbing.

369
00:41:05,596 --> 00:41:07,427
What is theworst case scenario?

370
00:41:07,998 --> 00:41:09,022
Sir..

371
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:11,327
God forbid, if among
the general population..

372
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:12,697
..this virus leaks.

373
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:14,496
Then within 24 hours..

374
00:41:14,738 --> 00:41:15,966
..this virus..

375
00:41:16,106 --> 00:41:18,165
..will affect 12
percent ofthe population.

376
00:41:18,676 --> 00:41:19,973
And within 48 hours..

377
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:21,335
..15 percent.

378
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:22,973
And so on.

379
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:26,950
The strain ofthis Ebola virus..

380
00:41:27,384 --> 00:41:28,681
..has been specially formulated.

381
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,950
The original strain
has been tampered with.

382
00:41:32,289 --> 00:41:33,415
And what we have now..

383
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:35,056
..is the weapons grade version.

384
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:36,517
And the cure?

385
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:39,428
According to our
latest research, there..

386
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:41,361
..is a Naquib Mahfouz.

387
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:42,966
He's a famous
scientist overthe world..

388
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:47,334
..who has done maximum research on
finding the cureto the Ebola virus.

389
00:41:47,471 --> 00:41:50,167
This is his picture.
-Where will we find Mahfouz?

390
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:28,978
It's been a while
since I met the Doctor.

391
00:42:31,282 --> 00:42:32,306
Who is Doctor?

392
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:34,343
Ex-ClA.

393
00:42:34,618 --> 00:42:35,642
Are we surprised?

394
00:42:35,986 --> 00:42:37,578
Sir, he's a strange man.

395
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:39,951
ClA, Ml-6, MOSSAD..

396
00:42:40,124 --> 00:42:42,058
He has written the
dictionary for all.

397
00:42:42,426 --> 00:42:43,950
Infact, the RAW in lndia..

398
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:47,963
..its A-B-C arethe
gift ofhis corrupt mind.

399
00:42:48,198 --> 00:42:49,222
Brilliant!

400
00:42:49,366 --> 00:42:51,231
Undercover operation,
rendition act..

401
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:54,103
..it's a brilliant
act ifyou've observed!

402
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:56,433
But it is not being used in lndia.

403
00:42:56,674 --> 00:43:00,132
Else, wewould've
kept Kasab in the jail..

404
00:43:00,611 --> 00:43:03,580
..and fed him gourmet cuisines,
shame on us!

405
00:43:04,315 --> 00:43:06,510
Anyway, America's
biological weapon..

406
00:43:06,717 --> 00:43:09,584
..he is the man behind it.

407
00:43:09,987 --> 00:43:11,955
The entireworld knows that lsrael..

408
00:43:12,056 --> 00:43:13,956
..has the most advanced..

409
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:17,152
..biological weapon programme.

410
00:43:17,294 --> 00:43:18,955
He is the creator and everything..

411
00:43:19,063 --> 00:43:20,690
..behind it, sir!

412
00:43:21,565 --> 00:43:22,589
He's a cheat!

413
00:43:23,334 --> 00:43:24,631
Nobody knows his name.

414
00:43:25,502 --> 00:43:26,969
He gives the formula,

415
00:43:27,071 --> 00:43:29,631
..operates smartly and..

416
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:31,139
..then wraps up everything..

417
00:43:31,342 --> 00:43:34,277
..and disappears. Try finding him.!!

418
00:43:46,156 --> 00:43:49,592
The ClA has left no stone
unturned trying to find this doctor.

419
00:43:51,028 --> 00:43:52,689
We believe that wherever he is..

420
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:54,495
..he's their special guest.

421
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:57,327
owns private limited companies and..

422
00:43:57,434 --> 00:44:00,597
..has sent us this gift.

423
00:44:00,738 --> 00:44:01,966
So what's RAW's plan?

424
00:44:02,373 --> 00:44:04,568
One of our agent..
- One agent?

425
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:07,404
What can one man do?

426
00:44:14,518 --> 00:44:17,248
Any aggressive movewe
make at this point..

427
00:44:17,354 --> 00:44:21,586
..will blow our agent's cover and
I can't jeopardize this operation.

428
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:33,629
Morethan half of Europe's police..

429
00:44:33,737 --> 00:44:35,500
..must be on his payroll, sir.

430
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:39,234
Tiill we are unsure of
his next plan or clue..

431
00:44:39,376 --> 00:44:41,708
..we can't so anything.
We're helpless!

432
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:43,410
Atleast, Mahfouz..

433
00:44:44,648 --> 00:44:46,377
..he has the cure to Ebola.

434
00:44:47,718 --> 00:44:48,946
Let's get to him!

435
00:45:27,591 --> 00:45:29,616
This apartment is clean.
Check your source.

436
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:44,164
Twenty minutes.

437
00:46:41,431 --> 00:46:42,455
Tiimeto go.

438
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:51,207
Second floor, Van Gough.

439
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:28,341
71.5 million dollars.

440
00:47:29,613 --> 00:47:30,944
In 1998..

441
00:47:32,716 --> 00:47:33,944
..this picture..

442
00:47:34,551 --> 00:47:36,985
..was sold at 71.5 million dollars.

443
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:41,490
In the list ofthe most
expensive paintings in theworld..

444
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:43,685
..this stands third.

445
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:47,955
1.1 million.

446
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:51,967
Hitler killed 1.1 million Jews..

447
00:47:52,069 --> 00:47:55,698
..nearby Auschwitz.

448
00:47:57,140 --> 00:48:00,598
Numbers, numbers, numbers.

449
00:48:03,013 --> 00:48:04,207
What's in a numbers?

450
00:48:07,351 --> 00:48:08,682
The explosion that you..

451
00:48:10,254 --> 00:48:11,949
..were supposed to do in 45 seconds.

452
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:14,990
You completed it in 43 seconds.

453
00:48:18,996 --> 00:48:20,122
What's in a numbers?

454
00:48:25,002 --> 00:48:26,026
No flash allowed!

455
00:48:38,482 --> 00:48:39,676
Sorry.

456
00:48:44,354 --> 00:48:45,946
Peoplewearing cheap shoes..

457
00:48:46,556 --> 00:48:47,955
..must be shot.

458
00:48:49,326 --> 00:48:50,350
You tell me.

459
00:48:51,228 --> 00:48:52,957
What's the purpose..

460
00:48:53,063 --> 00:48:54,325
..of your life?

461
00:48:58,168 --> 00:48:59,226
You're intelligent.

462
00:49:01,004 --> 00:49:02,972
You must've figured it by now that..

463
00:49:03,073 --> 00:49:07,601
..only I havethe
answers to my questions.

464
00:49:11,381 --> 00:49:13,042
Lives of people like you..

465
00:49:13,717 --> 00:49:14,945
..are aimless.

466
00:49:15,252 --> 00:49:16,276
Boring.

467
00:49:18,655 --> 00:49:22,318
The purpose of your
life is miniscule.

468
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:26,620
You're born and you die.

469
00:49:27,731 --> 00:49:29,494
It doesn't make any
differenceto anyone.

470
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:33,603
You'll have nothing in your hands,
neither your story..

471
00:49:35,005 --> 00:49:36,029
..nor your destiny.

472
00:49:38,742 --> 00:49:42,974
But if you conjoin your
purpose in life with mine..

473
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:45,478
..then your life
will become meaningful.

474
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:48,074
You..

475
00:49:49,086 --> 00:49:51,554
..who claims to be
protected bythe hands of Allah.

476
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:01,123
I was chosen.

477
00:50:03,734 --> 00:50:05,599
The universe has chosen me.

478
00:50:06,703 --> 00:50:09,968
My lifewas at crossroads.

479
00:50:10,741 --> 00:50:11,969
On one side..

480
00:50:13,377 --> 00:50:15,277
..a life of slavery
wherethe masters..

481
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:17,002
..would profit.

482
00:50:17,547 --> 00:50:18,571
On the other side..

483
00:50:19,983 --> 00:50:21,143
..I am the master..

484
00:50:21,718 --> 00:50:22,946
..and l..

485
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,381
..have the power
to changetheworld.

486
00:50:32,996 --> 00:50:34,020
Do you laugh?

487
00:50:45,175 --> 00:50:46,199
Learn how to!

488
00:50:50,113 --> 00:50:53,947
It's better people fear you than..

489
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:55,484
..Iove you.

490
00:51:21,678 --> 00:51:22,702
Shoot him!

491
00:51:24,514 --> 00:51:25,538
Doctor..

492
00:51:27,384 --> 00:51:28,976
..never forgives mistakes.

493
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:31,044
Do it!

494
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:28,068
Professor Mahfouz.

495
00:52:29,446 --> 00:52:30,936
I'm a big fan of yours.

496
00:52:34,451 --> 00:52:35,475
You..

497
00:52:36,386 --> 00:52:37,410
..and l..

498
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:39,012
..are connected.

499
00:52:39,256 --> 00:52:41,247
I love killing people.

500
00:52:43,393 --> 00:52:45,953
And you always wish to save them.

501
00:52:46,096 --> 00:52:47,222
You're old-fashioned, that's why.

502
00:52:49,065 --> 00:52:50,089
You..

503
00:52:50,233 --> 00:52:51,598
..have made me god.

504
00:52:52,235 --> 00:52:55,466
Earlier, I just had the devil.

505
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:56,969
Now, you have given me..

506
00:52:57,073 --> 00:53:00,338
..a sword to kill that devil.

507
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:03,141
The cure to Ebola.

508
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:05,140
Ebola is perfect.

509
00:53:07,083 --> 00:53:08,107
You see..

510
00:53:09,386 --> 00:53:12,583
..if an over-populated
country like lndia..

511
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:14,584
..has to be destroyed.

512
00:53:15,992 --> 00:53:18,324
Which weapon will you use?

513
00:53:18,995 --> 00:53:20,019
Which weapon?

514
00:53:20,297 --> 00:53:21,321
No idea?

515
00:53:21,731 --> 00:53:23,699
You're such a big scientist.

516
00:53:24,334 --> 00:53:26,234
But you're very foolish, brother.

517
00:53:28,638 --> 00:53:30,265
Biological weapon.

518
00:53:32,509 --> 00:53:34,704
One potent virus..

519
00:53:35,745 --> 00:53:36,939
..that will turn every lndian..

520
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:39,675
..into a suicide bomber.

521
00:53:41,251 --> 00:53:42,275
Think!

522
00:53:43,653 --> 00:53:45,951
Think of the beauty
behind this thought.

523
00:53:51,361 --> 00:53:53,056
One billion..

524
00:53:53,997 --> 00:53:55,259
..suicide bombers.

525
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:57,692
Thewar has changed.

526
00:53:59,035 --> 00:54:01,230
So will theweapon, professor.

527
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:04,972
I alone..

528
00:54:06,543 --> 00:54:07,976
..have made this age into..

529
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:11,948
..an age of proxywars.

530
00:54:18,455 --> 00:54:19,581
I'll miss you professor.

531
00:54:21,124 --> 00:54:22,216
But I'm afraid that..

532
00:54:22,325 --> 00:54:23,952
..you will not be alive..

533
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:25,584
..to witness all ofthis.

534
00:54:27,731 --> 00:54:28,959
Do you have a cigar?

535
00:54:41,411 --> 00:54:43,538
I don't smokethis cheap variety.

536
00:54:48,184 --> 00:54:50,982
You're very keen on
changing theworld, doctor.

537
00:54:51,655 --> 00:54:54,453
Interesting. Very interesting!

538
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:58,117
I'm very fond of psychology.

539
00:54:59,029 --> 00:55:00,690
It's my favourite subject.

540
00:55:01,998 --> 00:55:04,558
I like specimens like you.

541
00:55:05,602 --> 00:55:09,163
This diseased mind ofyours.

542
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:13,400
It's very entertaining.
Money, power..

543
00:55:14,244 --> 00:55:16,007
..all these things that you want.

544
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:19,471
This hunger that can
never be satiated.

545
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:21,382
There are many theories on this.

546
00:55:21,718 --> 00:55:24,551
Onethat fits you well.

547
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:25,678
It goes like this.

548
00:55:26,389 --> 00:55:30,223
Men like you are not
ableto satisfy your women.

549
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:32,393
Especially in bed.

550
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:36,120
Where it takes fervour
to satisfy the woman.

551
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:37,523
You need the drive..

552
00:55:38,368 --> 00:55:40,632
..which lacks in
impotent men like you.

553
00:55:41,571 --> 00:55:44,267
Your impotence starts bothering you.

554
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:47,067
You feel ashamed ofyourself!

555
00:55:47,544 --> 00:55:48,568
You feel disgusted!

556
00:56:16,506 --> 00:56:19,407
Suicide bombers, proxywar.

557
00:56:20,143 --> 00:56:22,077
Why do you need to do all this?

558
00:56:23,613 --> 00:56:25,308
You could've just taken a viagra.

559
00:56:26,082 --> 00:56:27,515
Life would be worth living..

560
00:56:28,118 --> 00:56:29,142
..not killing.

561
00:56:33,123 --> 00:56:34,147
Take him away.

562
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:45,964
After Mahfouz's death..

563
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:49,500
..India's remnant hope..

564
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:52,064
..will also die.

565
00:56:53,009 --> 00:56:55,136
Bytheway, you
have come a long way..

566
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:57,940
..Agent Azaan Khan.

567
01:01:45,134 --> 01:01:46,158
Hello!

568
01:01:52,008 --> 01:01:53,236
Azaan, this better be good.

569
01:01:54,010 --> 01:01:55,375
Else everyone is
going to be in trouble.

570
01:05:30,493 --> 01:05:32,427
For the concluding
part ofthe performance..

571
01:05:32,528 --> 01:05:33,552
..please come back tomorrow.

572
01:05:57,053 --> 01:05:58,987
This story is mine.

573
01:06:01,724 --> 01:06:02,952
This story..

574
01:06:03,426 --> 01:06:04,450
..is mine.

575
01:06:06,996 --> 01:06:08,588
It's a story about my life.

576
01:06:08,731 --> 01:06:10,221
I've always known your story.

577
01:06:11,734 --> 01:06:13,326
You're the good brother.

578
01:06:15,004 --> 01:06:17,165
This story how will it end?

579
01:06:18,674 --> 01:06:19,698
How will it end?

580
01:06:20,443 --> 01:06:21,705
Come back tomorrow.

581
01:06:23,179 --> 01:06:24,168
Come, let's go!

582
01:06:49,071 --> 01:06:51,232
Good morning! Where are
you travelling to, sir?

583
01:06:52,141 --> 01:06:53,165
Mumbai.

584
01:07:17,733 --> 01:07:18,995
Why did you do this to me?

585
01:07:19,468 --> 01:07:20,958
Why did you do this to me?

586
01:07:21,137 --> 01:07:22,968
Why did you do this to me?

587
01:07:23,239 --> 01:07:24,968
Why did you do this to me?

588
01:07:25,207 --> 01:07:26,970
Why did you do this to me?

589
01:07:27,109 --> 01:07:32,570
Why did you do this to me?

590
01:07:34,483 --> 01:07:35,507
Where am I lost?

591
01:07:36,152 --> 01:07:37,176
I don't know.

592
01:07:37,453 --> 01:07:38,477
Will you find me?

593
01:08:06,515 --> 01:08:07,982
Will you find me?

594
01:09:53,989 --> 01:09:55,957
How will our stories end..

595
01:09:56,659 --> 01:09:58,058
..sometimes wewonder?

596
01:09:58,994 --> 01:10:00,962
Whilewe wonder, we forget..

597
01:10:01,597 --> 01:10:05,033
..we're making our own choices.
Our own paths.

598
01:10:05,601 --> 01:10:07,228
One karma at a time.

599
01:10:09,004 --> 01:10:10,437
Our stories and how theywill end..

600
01:10:11,173 --> 01:10:12,504
..is in our hands.

601
01:10:13,609 --> 01:10:18,478
"Beautiful! Beautiful!"

602
01:10:18,981 --> 01:10:23,941
"Beautiful! Beautiful!"

603
01:10:24,086 --> 01:10:29,080
"Beautiful! Beautiful!"

604
01:10:29,491 --> 01:10:34,952
"Beautiful! Beautiful!"

605
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:40,968
"With thefingers ofthe soul.."

606
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:46,337
"..you sketched a picture."

607
01:10:46,675 --> 01:10:51,669
"ls it an image made ofsand?"

608
01:10:52,047 --> 01:10:56,950
"Or is it my life?"

609
01:10:57,253 --> 01:11:02,316
"You've healed my wounds."

610
01:11:02,725 --> 01:11:06,957
"You're like medicine."

611
01:11:07,096 --> 01:11:12,124
"Beautiful! Beautiful!"

612
01:11:12,301 --> 01:11:17,534
"Beautiful! Beautiful!"

613
01:11:17,673 --> 01:11:22,406
"Beautiful! Beautiful!"

614
01:11:23,012 --> 01:11:28,678
"Beautiful! Beautiful!"

615
01:11:29,084 --> 01:11:31,450
"With your touch.."

616
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:34,382
"..everything is fragrant."

617
01:11:34,723 --> 01:11:39,592
"You'rethe aroma, beautiful!"

618
01:11:39,728 --> 01:11:42,322
"Lettheworld change."

619
01:11:42,498 --> 01:11:45,023
"lf I get you.."

620
01:11:45,334 --> 01:11:49,532
"..just once, beautiful!"

621
01:11:49,672 --> 01:11:54,700
"Beautiful! Beautiful!"

622
01:11:55,010 --> 01:11:59,674
"Beautiful! Beautiful!"

623
01:12:00,182 --> 01:12:05,210
"Beautiful! Beautiful!"

624
01:12:05,454 --> 01:12:11,484
"Beautiful! Beautiful!"

625
01:12:33,382 --> 01:12:38,445
"Your mesmerising face."

626
01:12:38,721 --> 01:12:43,681
"My heart is quenched."

627
01:12:43,992 --> 01:12:49,055
"Maythe darkness fade."

628
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:54,064
"Such is your light."

629
01:12:54,636 --> 01:12:59,403
"You've healed my wounds."

630
01:13:00,075 --> 01:13:04,205
"You're like medicine."

631
01:13:04,346 --> 01:13:09,249
"Beautiful! Beautiful!"

632
01:13:09,485 --> 01:13:14,684
"Beautiful! Beautiful!"

633
01:13:14,990 --> 01:13:20,155
"Beautiful! Beautiful!"

634
01:13:20,329 --> 01:13:25,961
"Beautiful! Beautiful!"

635
01:13:26,535 --> 01:13:28,969
"With your touch.."

636
01:13:29,138 --> 01:13:31,698
"..everything is fragrant."

637
01:13:32,141 --> 01:13:36,976
"You'rethe aroma, beautiful!"

638
01:13:37,212 --> 01:13:39,680
"Lettheworld change."

639
01:13:39,982 --> 01:13:42,246
"lf I get you.."

640
01:13:42,618 --> 01:13:46,952
"..just once, beautiful!"

641
01:13:47,055 --> 01:13:51,958
"Beautiful! Beautiful!"

642
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:57,463
"Beautiful! Beautiful!"

643
01:13:57,599 --> 01:14:02,536
"Beautiful! Beautiful!"

644
01:14:03,005 --> 01:14:08,966
"Beautiful! Beautiful!"

645
01:14:55,057 --> 01:14:56,957
Web blog Mahfouz.

646
01:14:57,159 --> 01:14:58,285
Twenty years.

647
01:14:59,194 --> 01:15:01,560
2068 tests.

648
01:15:02,231 --> 01:15:03,960
My last attempt.

649
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:08,164
Antigen 4532..

650
01:15:09,738 --> 01:15:12,605
Zahra case no. 359.

651
01:15:13,642 --> 01:15:16,577
Blood heavily infected
with Ebola Maburg virus.

652
01:15:17,045 --> 01:15:18,410
Showing considerable improvement.

653
01:15:24,353 --> 01:15:25,945
Mahfouz's lab is in Morocco.

654
01:15:27,055 --> 01:15:30,149
Doctor had tested his
virus in some African village.

655
01:15:31,126 --> 01:15:32,559
So it can be in Morocco.

656
01:15:32,661 --> 01:15:34,322
Yes, it's possible.

657
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:36,622
Zahra was in such a village then.

658
01:15:38,066 --> 01:15:39,090
Mahfouzwas theretoo.

659
01:15:40,402 --> 01:15:43,530
Mahfouz had tested his
cure on everybody but..

660
01:15:45,073 --> 01:15:46,700
..it only worked on Zahra.

661
01:15:48,010 --> 01:15:49,034
Wow!

662
01:15:50,078 --> 01:15:51,943
Zahra has the cureto Ebola, Sharma.

663
01:15:54,016 --> 01:15:55,950
That's fantastic news, Azaan. Look!

664
01:15:56,184 --> 01:15:57,674
The girl and the sand artist..

665
01:15:57,986 --> 01:16:00,250
..don't let go ofthem at any cost.

666
01:16:00,989 --> 01:16:02,013
Have I made myself clear?

667
01:16:03,625 --> 01:16:04,649
Azaan!

668
01:16:06,028 --> 01:16:07,052
Well done!

669
01:16:41,096 --> 01:16:42,586
This is no cure to Ebola.

670
01:16:42,998 --> 01:16:44,090
What did you send us?

671
01:16:44,199 --> 01:16:46,394
Itwas nothing but plain water.

672
01:16:47,469 --> 01:16:49,630
In twenty four hours..

673
01:16:49,738 --> 01:16:51,262
..find a real antidote.

674
01:16:51,540 --> 01:16:52,700
Orthe deal is off.

675
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:54,399
And so is your head!

676
01:16:59,548 --> 01:17:01,038
Professor Mahfouz.

677
01:17:03,719 --> 01:17:05,949
I feel like killing you once again.

678
01:17:35,717 --> 01:17:37,981
I'm guilty of
professor Mahfouz's death.

679
01:17:38,987 --> 01:17:40,215
I'm responsible for his death.

680
01:17:56,605 --> 01:17:58,334
Never knew my parents.

681
01:18:00,342 --> 01:18:02,242
Dr. Mahfouz is all I had.

682
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:07,312
He's all we had.
- Can I have a coke?

683
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:10,248
He saved my sister's life.

684
01:18:37,312 --> 01:18:38,973
Do you still think
I'm the good brother?

685
01:18:52,294 --> 01:18:53,591
It's not safe here anymore.

686
01:18:54,730 --> 01:18:55,958
We need to go.

687
01:20:31,993 --> 01:20:33,017
Zahra!

688
01:20:34,663 --> 01:20:35,687
Come here!

689
01:20:36,331 --> 01:20:37,355
Zahra!

690
01:21:29,084 --> 01:21:30,449
Why is Zahra in danger?

691
01:21:33,355 --> 01:21:34,982
The cure for Ebola is Zahra.

692
01:21:35,457 --> 01:21:36,481
It's her blood.

693
01:21:41,997 --> 01:21:43,021
Zahra!?

694
01:21:43,164 --> 01:21:45,132
That's why Dr.
Mahfouz has sent me here.

695
01:21:52,474 --> 01:21:53,498
Come, let's go!

696
01:22:25,173 --> 01:22:26,970
I'm Aman's culprit.

697
01:22:28,576 --> 01:22:29,634
I'm guilty.

698
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:33,707
But what happened to Aman..

699
01:22:34,849 --> 01:22:36,316
..will not happen to Zahra.

700
01:22:37,719 --> 01:22:39,448
I will not let anything touch Zahra.

701
01:22:40,388 --> 01:22:41,719
I won't let her down.

702
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:44,050
I know.

703
01:23:04,145 --> 01:23:05,669
From the moment I saw you..

704
01:23:06,715 --> 01:23:07,841
..I knew..

705
01:23:08,483 --> 01:23:10,508
I've been waiting
for you mywhole life.

706
01:23:16,558 --> 01:23:20,995
"l feel you know
that I love you so."

707
01:23:32,574 --> 01:23:37,307
"Why are my nights so sleepless?"

708
01:23:38,146 --> 01:23:43,778
"Even my mornings are full of
thoughts." - "l feel you know.."

709
01:23:43,885 --> 01:23:49,084
"Yesterday's futile
talks seem special."

710
01:24:06,207 --> 01:24:09,108
"For god's sake.."

711
01:24:09,477 --> 01:24:11,604
"..don't hide!"

712
01:24:11,713 --> 01:24:14,807
"For god's sake.."

713
01:24:15,083 --> 01:24:17,244
"..don't hesitate."

714
01:24:17,385 --> 01:24:20,548
"For god's sake.."

715
01:24:20,655 --> 01:24:22,953
"..tell me that.."

716
01:24:23,425 --> 01:24:28,863
"..you love me, for god's sake!"

717
01:24:32,033 --> 01:24:36,868
"l feel you know
that I love you so."

718
01:24:36,971 --> 01:24:40,270
"For god's sake.."

719
01:24:40,408 --> 01:24:43,502
"For god's sake.."

720
01:24:43,912 --> 01:24:48,110
"l feel you know
that I love you so."

721
01:24:48,249 --> 01:24:51,548
"For god's sake."

722
01:24:51,686 --> 01:24:54,814
"For god's sake."

723
01:24:55,390 --> 01:25:00,020
"l feel you know
that I love you so."

724
01:25:04,065 --> 01:25:05,555
Koln Bonn, Germany.

725
01:25:08,136 --> 01:25:09,194
We'll meet there.

726
01:27:22,136 --> 01:27:23,228
I'm happy.

727
01:28:05,313 --> 01:28:06,371
Sharma has turned.

728
01:28:07,548 --> 01:28:08,606
Traitor?

729
01:28:08,916 --> 01:28:09,974
Doctor!

730
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:14,249
Bastard!

731
01:28:29,637 --> 01:28:30,797
I agreethat..

732
01:28:31,439 --> 01:28:32,701
..I pulled the trigger.

733
01:28:34,309 --> 01:28:36,800
But you pointed the gun at Afreen..

734
01:28:37,178 --> 01:28:39,078
..with your so called love.

735
01:28:41,516 --> 01:28:42,574
Truly!

736
01:28:43,151 --> 01:28:44,277
You're right.

737
01:28:44,619 --> 01:28:47,087
Allah's hand is protecting you.

738
01:28:48,289 --> 01:28:49,347
Truly!

739
01:28:51,059 --> 01:28:52,151
Look..

740
01:28:52,627 --> 01:28:54,788
..whoever's life you step into..

741
01:28:54,896 --> 01:28:56,659
..you directly..

742
01:28:56,764 --> 01:28:58,391
..send them to Allah.

743
01:28:58,733 --> 01:28:59,825
Why?

744
01:29:11,746 --> 01:29:14,840
Oh! Yes. Bytheway, did l
mention that it's my birthdaytoday?

745
01:29:16,250 --> 01:29:17,308
And I promise you.

746
01:29:17,552 --> 01:29:18,814
In my entire life..

747
01:29:19,053 --> 01:29:21,385
..none has given me a
better gift than you.

748
01:29:22,924 --> 01:29:23,982
That's it!

749
01:29:24,092 --> 01:29:25,582
I was waiting forthis moment.

750
01:29:28,296 --> 01:29:30,264
I haveturned Doctor into god.

751
01:29:32,133 --> 01:29:34,260
Virus and its cure..

752
01:29:34,635 --> 01:29:35,693
..are both with him now.

753
01:29:50,051 --> 01:29:51,143
Butthe Doctor..

754
01:29:52,954 --> 01:29:54,717
..he has special plans for me.

755
01:29:59,527 --> 01:30:03,122
You could not meet
your loving brother.

756
01:30:04,799 --> 01:30:05,857
But don'tworry.

757
01:30:06,234 --> 01:30:09,169
Be assured that you
were on the right path.

758
01:30:10,204 --> 01:30:11,603
After the London bombings..

759
01:30:12,273 --> 01:30:14,366
..Aman became Doctor's pet.

760
01:30:14,842 --> 01:30:17,402
But now what is the
difference between Aman and Azaan?

761
01:30:17,879 --> 01:30:19,312
Both of you are ofthe same kin.

762
01:30:21,716 --> 01:30:22,774
Both killers.

763
01:30:32,927 --> 01:30:36,158
You're the good brother.
You're good!

764
01:30:49,911 --> 01:30:50,969
And..

765
01:30:51,412 --> 01:30:52,470
..Afreen.

766
01:31:01,055 --> 01:31:02,113
Viirgin?

767
01:31:25,913 --> 01:31:26,971
Move!

768
01:33:36,177 --> 01:33:41,513
"With thefingers of the soul.."

769
01:33:42,116 --> 01:33:47,452
"..you sketched a picture."

770
01:33:48,055 --> 01:33:53,493
"ls it an image made of sand?"

771
01:33:54,095 --> 01:33:59,556
"Or is it my life?"

772
01:33:59,900 --> 01:34:05,634
"You've healed my wounds."

773
01:34:06,207 --> 01:34:10,507
Happy birthday, Sharma!
-"You're like medicine."

774
01:34:10,878 --> 01:34:16,248
"Beautiful! Beautiful!"

775
01:34:16,751 --> 01:34:22,553
"Beautiful! Beautiful!"

776
01:34:22,757 --> 01:34:28,354
"Beautiful! Beautiful!"

777
01:34:28,863 --> 01:34:34,893
"Beautiful! Beautiful!"

778
01:34:35,970 --> 01:34:38,768
"With your touch.."

779
01:34:38,973 --> 01:34:41,908
"..everything is fragrant."

780
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:46,636
"You'rethe aroma, beautiful!"

781
01:34:46,747 --> 01:34:50,615
"Lettheworld change."

782
01:34:50,951 --> 01:34:53,749
"lf I get you.."

783
01:34:54,021 --> 01:34:58,583
"..just once, beautiful!"

784
01:34:58,726 --> 01:35:04,528
"Beautiful! Beautiful!"

785
01:35:04,799 --> 01:35:10,465
"Beautiful! Beautiful!"

786
01:35:10,738 --> 01:35:16,233
"Beautiful! Beautiful!"

787
01:35:16,777 --> 01:35:25,446
"Beautiful! Beautiful!"

788
01:37:01,282 --> 01:37:03,045
Do you even know why
you want to kill me?

789
01:37:03,517 --> 01:37:04,643
What difference does it make?

790
01:37:05,853 --> 01:37:06,911
I don't care, man!

791
01:37:07,488 --> 01:37:08,546
Yes, you do.

792
01:37:09,456 --> 01:37:10,753
Deep within..

793
01:37:11,225 --> 01:37:12,749
..you'retrying to
run away from yourself.

794
01:37:13,260 --> 01:37:14,659
Right and wrong, war and jihad.

795
01:37:15,329 --> 01:37:16,421
You were calling it a cocktail,
weren't you?

796
01:37:17,531 --> 01:37:19,362
Now the intoxication is fading away.

797
01:37:20,100 --> 01:37:21,260
I can see it in your eyes.

798
01:37:21,902 --> 01:37:24,029
Your conscience has
started pricking you now.

799
01:37:25,072 --> 01:37:27,666
Our life is not so simple, Azaan.

800
01:37:28,742 --> 01:37:29,800
My life..

801
01:37:29,944 --> 01:37:31,605
..is not so happy.

802
01:37:31,745 --> 01:37:32,803
You had said..

803
01:37:33,214 --> 01:37:34,476
..that saving one innocent man..

804
01:37:35,182 --> 01:37:36,877
..is like saving the entire mankind.

805
01:37:38,118 --> 01:37:39,176
Simple.

806
01:37:52,399 --> 01:37:53,764
The virus has reached lndia.

807
01:37:55,769 --> 01:37:57,100
I just know one address.

808
01:37:57,972 --> 01:37:59,371
546, Lakshmi Mansion.

809
01:38:01,642 --> 01:38:03,132
That girl also..

810
01:38:03,878 --> 01:38:05,140
..has been taken to Hong Kong.

811
01:38:07,081 --> 01:38:08,173
Global Corporation.

812
01:38:09,016 --> 01:38:10,074
And one more thing.

813
01:38:11,719 --> 01:38:14,153
Who is going to benefit
from lndia's destruction?

814
01:38:15,322 --> 01:38:16,380
Pakistan?

815
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:20,618
brother!

816
01:38:30,471 --> 01:38:31,529
From now on..

817
01:38:32,006 --> 01:38:33,064
..you're one of us.

818
01:38:39,747 --> 01:38:41,681
You will have four
diplomatic immunity..

819
01:38:41,782 --> 01:38:43,079
..wherever you go.

820
01:38:43,350 --> 01:38:45,580
ClA, RAW, lnterpol.

821
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:47,285
None of them can touch you!

822
01:38:50,057 --> 01:38:51,115
Cheers!

823
01:38:51,325 --> 01:38:52,417
Cheers!

824
01:42:57,671 --> 01:42:58,729
I need a room.

825
01:42:59,940 --> 01:43:01,601
How many nights? -One night.

826
01:43:02,409 --> 01:43:03,467
1 90 dollars.

827
01:43:36,810 --> 01:43:37,868
Put him through.

828
01:43:39,580 --> 01:43:40,638
Global Corporation.

829
01:43:41,715 --> 01:43:42,773
Hong Kong.

830
01:43:43,517 --> 01:43:44,609
I'll need backup.

831
01:43:45,786 --> 01:43:46,980
Azaan, don't worry.

832
01:43:47,754 --> 01:43:49,119
We'll do our best.

833
01:43:50,157 --> 01:43:51,215
Sir..

834
01:43:51,525 --> 01:43:54,085
We need permission
to infiltrate China.

835
01:43:54,228 --> 01:43:55,286
Menon.

836
01:43:56,330 --> 01:43:59,265
You know that I can't
give you that permission.

837
01:44:01,435 --> 01:44:02,459
But this time..

838
01:44:03,937 --> 01:44:06,235
..you don't need my permission.

839
01:44:07,541 --> 01:44:08,599
Good luck!

840
01:45:12,239 --> 01:45:13,866
Brother are you ok?

841
01:45:14,141 --> 01:45:15,199
Stay away from me!

842
01:45:18,312 --> 01:45:20,143
Whats wrong with you!

843
01:45:20,414 --> 01:45:21,881
Have you lost it!

844
01:45:26,386 --> 01:45:27,944
Tell me fast!
- I don't know where he is.

845
01:45:33,026 --> 01:45:34,186
No, I'll tell you!

846
01:45:34,494 --> 01:45:35,688
Room no. 205!

847
01:46:00,053 --> 01:46:01,077
Where's the girl?

848
01:46:16,603 --> 01:46:17,695
Is he dead?

849
01:46:19,773 --> 01:46:20,865
Yes.

850
01:46:29,616 --> 01:46:31,049
Looks like you're dead inside.

851
01:46:33,820 --> 01:46:34,912
I'll do you a favour.

852
01:46:35,956 --> 01:46:36,888
I'm going to kill you.

853
01:46:40,494 --> 01:46:41,620
Whatwill you kill a dead?!

854
01:47:07,554 --> 01:47:08,919
Tracking the location, sir.

855
01:47:10,290 --> 01:47:11,621
Ear piece.

856
01:47:13,894 --> 01:47:15,327
GPS tracker. -Yeah.

857
01:47:15,562 --> 01:47:17,189
You're all set, sir. -Thank you.

858
01:47:22,102 --> 01:47:23,330
Sorry aboutAfreen.

859
01:47:24,938 --> 01:47:26,565
Azaan, it is the way ofnature.

860
01:47:27,007 --> 01:47:28,065
..that each time god's
creation has been threatened..

861
01:47:28,175 --> 01:47:29,267
..to be annihilated
and there rises a man..

862
01:47:30,343 --> 01:47:31,867
..with the power and
the selflessness..

863
01:47:33,313 --> 01:47:37,613
..to preserve his creation..

864
01:47:37,751 --> 01:47:38,809
We havethe location, sir.

865
01:47:43,356 --> 01:47:44,448
Azaan!

866
01:47:46,393 --> 01:47:47,485
Savethe country.

867
01:47:50,997 --> 01:47:53,465
Therewill not be a darker
day in the history of lndia.

868
01:47:53,567 --> 01:47:56,798
The menace of Ebola virus
has reached the common people.

869
01:47:56,937 --> 01:48:00,566
On one hand, the count of
infected people is rising.

870
01:48:00,707 --> 01:48:02,800
On the other hand
is a bitter truth..

871
01:48:02,943 --> 01:48:04,535
..that there's no cureto Ebola.

872
01:48:04,678 --> 01:48:05,736
There's no antidoteto it.

873
01:48:05,846 --> 01:48:08,713
This dangerous virus..
-..is very grave and hopeless.

874
01:48:09,082 --> 01:48:11,107
There's no wayto
control this pandemic.

875
01:48:11,852 --> 01:48:15,447
It threatens to be the biggest
catastrophe in the history oflndia.

876
01:48:17,057 --> 01:48:18,649
Kolkata, Mumbai, Agra and..

877
01:48:18,758 --> 01:48:21,591
..New Delhi are in
critical condition.

878
01:48:21,962 --> 01:48:23,361
There's no known cure for Ebola.

879
01:48:23,830 --> 01:48:26,355
The situation in the country
is very grave and hopeless.

880
01:48:26,933 --> 01:48:28,560
There is no way to
control this pandemic.

881
01:48:29,202 --> 01:48:32,330
It threatens to be the biggest
catastrophe in the history of lndia.

882
01:48:33,240 --> 01:48:35,606
Their crude home-made detonators..

883
01:48:35,742 --> 01:48:37,300
..havethe Ebola
virus attached to them.

884
01:49:58,925 --> 01:50:00,893
And yes. Agra's Taj Mahal.

885
01:50:01,227 --> 01:50:06,324
Kolkata. Kolkata, two locations.
Howrah station and New Market.

886
01:50:06,800 --> 01:50:10,167
In Delhi, I have DP, Red
Fort and the Metro. The Metro!

887
01:50:10,470 --> 01:50:13,496
All the stations. I
need Mumbai on the line.

888
01:51:25,912 --> 01:51:28,881
Sir, Zahra is our only hope.

889
01:51:29,282 --> 01:51:30,374
The pharmaceutical company..

890
01:51:30,483 --> 01:51:33,884
..are convinced that they can
come up with an Ebola vaccine..

891
01:51:33,987 --> 01:51:35,818
..with her blood sample.

892
01:51:36,623 --> 01:51:39,524
And sir, I know that
you know this but..

893
01:51:39,626 --> 01:51:42,356
..panic and fear
psychosis setting in.

894
01:51:42,462 --> 01:51:43,690
I'll handlethat.

895
01:51:44,097 --> 01:51:45,189
Thank you.

896
01:52:05,885 --> 01:52:07,785
Azaan do you realize
What you have done?!

897
01:52:27,240 --> 01:52:28,798
I have quit
running away dueto fear.

898
01:52:35,482 --> 01:52:36,574
And now..

899
01:52:37,250 --> 01:52:38,740
..the gun is in my hand.

900
01:52:44,224 --> 01:52:45,521
Azaan Khan!

901
01:52:46,993 --> 01:52:48,426
You're very stubborn.

902
01:52:57,537 --> 01:52:58,868
I hadn't got lost.

903
01:52:59,806 --> 01:53:01,205
Why did you go in search of me?

904
01:53:03,543 --> 01:53:04,601
Enough, Aman!

905
01:53:04,811 --> 01:53:06,904
Enough? Enough?

906
01:53:07,847 --> 01:53:09,007
This is just the beginning.

907
01:53:10,650 --> 01:53:13,175
Azaan Khan, I'm your disciple.

908
01:53:14,788 --> 01:53:16,050
Have you forgotten your reality?

909
01:53:17,257 --> 01:53:18,656
I was just twelve years old.

910
01:53:19,692 --> 01:53:22,525
I was angry because l
saw my family being killed.

911
01:53:23,797 --> 01:53:26,322
I made myself and you
the victim of that madness.

912
01:53:27,100 --> 01:53:29,830
And have you made that
madness the purpose of your life?

913
01:53:29,969 --> 01:53:31,163
Grandfather was mad.

914
01:53:31,704 --> 01:53:34,366
Instead of fighting for Taliban,
he fought against them.

915
01:53:34,741 --> 01:53:36,333
Hetook everyonewith him!

916
01:53:36,876 --> 01:53:37,934
And the punishment forthat..

917
01:53:38,077 --> 01:53:39,772
..how long arewe going
to give it to theworld?

918
01:53:40,480 --> 01:53:42,072
Till when arewe going
to punish ourselves?

919
01:53:47,353 --> 01:53:48,411
Tiill when?

920
01:53:53,359 --> 01:53:55,156
You and Zahra have
to leavethis place.

921
01:53:56,196 --> 01:53:57,356
It's time to move on.

922
01:54:00,066 --> 01:54:01,158
Pick up the phone.

923
01:54:01,568 --> 01:54:03,729
Call your men and tell them
that security has been breached.

924
01:54:23,456 --> 01:54:25,083
