1
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:58,471
There's an ancient quote by Buddha.'

2
00:01:58,533 --> 00:02:00,479
The trouble is you
think you've got the time.'

3
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,511
I often get these kind of quotes
on whatsAppf

4
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,277
But they're way beyond my grasp,'

5
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,902
And the closest
I ever came to Buddhism...'

6
00:02:19,067 --> 00:02:22,537
...was a close friendship
with 'Old Rum'.

7
00:02:23,167 --> 00:02:26,273
And that friendship
got too intense last night.'

8
00:02:28,533 --> 00:02:30,035
We crossed all limits...'

9
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,443
...and what did I get in return.'

10
00:02:33,533 --> 00:02:35,979
4000 extra calories,
and a blockbuster hangover.'

11
00:02:36,067 --> 00:02:39,446
That reminds me, my weight is greater
than my followers on Twitter.'

12
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,971
Why does everything
that star-ts out so amazingly...'

13
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:49,069
...end so badly?'

14
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,508
I hate my life.

15
00:02:59,267 --> 00:03:01,247
Maltil!

16
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,335
Maltil!

17
00:03:04,433 --> 00:03:07,880
I'm so dependent on Malti and have
no idea what I'd do without her.'

18
00:03:08,533 --> 00:03:10,945
And this is Dimpy.'

19
00:03:11,033 --> 00:03:12,535
Who I call the son my dad never had."

20
00:03:12,933 --> 00:03:16,437
And me? Sometimes I feel
I'm his step-daughter.

21
00:03:25,367 --> 00:03:27,369
This is my one-room-kitchen.'

22
00:03:27,567 --> 00:03:30,446
I spend half of my life
on Mumbai's roads.'

23
00:03:33,533 --> 00:03:38,505
And my average commuting time is longer
than the flight from Mumbai to Dubai.'

24
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,037
And turbulence? Full.'

25
00:03:41,233 --> 00:03:42,177
In fact, even these potholes
have become my friends.'

26
00:03:42,233 --> 00:03:45,271
Thanks to them, I changed my
tyres six times in the last one year...'

27
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,945
...which is expensive.'

28
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,809
Everything I own is bought
on installments.'

29
00:03:48,867 --> 00:03:50,574
And so I had to give up smoking.'

30
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:52,039
I can't afford it.'

31
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,941
I can't afford anything.'

32
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,538
In fact, my entire life is on installments now,
which exceeds even my salary.'

33
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,335
I am Noor... Noor Roy Chaudhary.'

34
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,346
Journalist...or Joker!'

35
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,277
Journalist? Jo...!'

36
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,246
Frankly, sometimes I feel
I am less of a journalist...'

37
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:20,505
...and more of a joker.'

38
00:04:20,867 --> 00:04:22,540
But let's look on the bright side.'

39
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,305
It's still not too late.'

40
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,313
If I learn to take the right step
at the right time'

41
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:30,405
...then I'm sure I'll reach exactly
where I deserve to be.'

42
00:04:37,167 --> 00:04:38,976
Most geniuses do.'

43
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:42,814
Today is my 28th
binhday...another year gone.'

44
00:04:42,867 --> 00:04:45,245
The world failed to
discover me this year again.'

45
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:48,473
But next year...
all this is going to change.'

46
00:04:48,967 --> 00:04:50,446
The world of serious journalism...'

47
00:04:50,533 --> 00:04:52,535
...is going to get
their new Barkha.'

48
00:04:54,967 --> 00:04:56,537
No more adult sites.'

49
00:04:57,167 --> 00:04:59,374
This year you haven't got a chance...'

50
00:04:59,567 --> 00:05:02,514
...because this year,
I'm going to find myself a real man'

51
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,813
This year...I'll be turning over from
'Seedhi-Savitri'(Decent) to a 'Tedhi Savitri'.

52
00:05:07,867 --> 00:05:09,437
I've got an odd habit...'

53
00:05:09,533 --> 00:05:11,911
...I talk to myself a lot.'

54
00:05:11,967 --> 00:05:13,913
Anywaymfirst work, then life.'

55
00:05:13,967 --> 00:05:15,378
Always and every time.'

56
00:05:15,467 --> 00:05:16,844
I am getting feelers from CNN.'

57
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,938
Who knows...maybe I'll
get my dream job this monsoon.'

58
00:05:20,033 --> 00:05:22,912
...however we regret
to inform you...blah-blah...

59
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:26,535
Of course.

60
00:05:37,033 --> 00:05:39,377
How can I do it without you?

61
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:41,834
Right.

62
00:05:42,067 --> 00:05:46,038
Of course, baby. Of course.

63
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,470
Noor!
- Yeah!

64
00:05:47,533 --> 00:05:49,012
There was a time
when every journalist...'

65
00:05:49,067 --> 00:05:51,138
...wanted to grow up
and be like Shekhar Das.'

66
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,472
He was never afraid
of being inside the action.'

67
00:05:56,167 --> 00:05:59,376
But...love changes everyone.'

68
00:05:59,467 --> 00:06:01,845
Shekhar got married
to Lavina...and bam...'

69
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,402
That was the end.'

70
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,447
That's the journey from
'risk' to 'lshq' (LOVE)'

71
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,377
Now there's just BBTT.'

72
00:06:08,533 --> 00:06:11,412
Biwi (WIFE),
Bacche (KIDS), Trips and TRPS.'

73
00:06:11,467 --> 00:06:13,071
I've to go now, baby. Bye.

74
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,873
That's the world of Shekhar Das.'

75
00:06:22,467 --> 00:06:24,913
There...
- Where?

76
00:06:25,067 --> 00:06:26,205
There...

77
00:06:28,233 --> 00:06:29,439
Lunch with Lavina.

78
00:06:29,533 --> 00:06:32,173
So...
- Go.

79
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,211
Where?
- Film City.

80
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,938
What?
- Sunny Leone...interview.

81
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,035
Shekhar, even I have plans.

82
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,941
What plans...?
You're a journalist. Now go.

83
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,502
The crew's already on their way.

84
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:41,841
You know, it's not even 11130...

85
00:06:41,933 --> 00:06:43,935
...and already 17 people
have died in the local trains.

86
00:06:44,467 --> 00:06:46,413
And, what about the coastal
road proposed by the government...

87
00:06:46,467 --> 00:06:48,469
...that's ruining the
livelihoods of the fishermen.

88
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,069
And the file on the
Sewage Workers...

89
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,374
...which I kept on your table a
month ago...it's still rotting there.

90
00:06:53,467 --> 00:06:55,504
Film City...Sunny Leone... Now!

91
00:06:55,967 --> 00:06:59,210
Shekhar, it's my birthday.
- Happy birthday, Noor.

92
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,210
Now go.

93
00:07:00,533 --> 00:07:01,477
Baby...

94
00:07:01,533 --> 00:07:04,309
I'm not going to meet her... No!
- Screw you!

95
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:05,811
I heard that!

96
00:07:06,033 --> 00:07:08,479
And listen wear your black
halter, not the red one.

97
00:07:08,533 --> 00:07:10,535
Black makes you look...slim...

98
00:07:14,533 --> 00:07:15,534
You know what I mean.

99
00:07:19,233 --> 00:07:22,339
Did I mention that Levine's dad
is the owner of a big news channel?'

100
00:07:23,033 --> 00:07:25,980
And he gave Shekhar
this news agency as dowry.'

101
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,578
And now this is the only
job this news agency's got.'

102
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:32,905
Covering crappy stories for
Shekhafis father-in-laws company.'

103
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,311
This is my screwed up life...
and this is my screwed up boss.'

104
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,937
Junior correspondent at The Buzz.'

105
00:07:39,967 --> 00:07:42,174
It's just a cool name,
there's no buzz here.'

106
00:07:42,267 --> 00:07:44,213
And my show,
Mumbai believe it or not.'

107
00:07:44,267 --> 00:07:46,304
It's the most pointless
show in the world.'

108
00:07:50,467 --> 00:07:53,175
Meaning...l am the most pointless
journalist in this world.'

109
00:07:53,467 --> 00:07:56,277
So this story will
be perfect for my show.'

110
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:01,243
Did celebrated journalist Shekhar Das
fall down the stairs of his own office?'

111
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,803
To post or not to post.'

112
00:08:03,867 --> 00:08:06,507
ls Shekhar Das really fallen so low?'

113
00:08:08,067 --> 00:08:11,207
In case you didn't notice,
I've got a strange habit...'

114
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,439
I talk to myself.'

115
00:08:26,467 --> 00:08:27,969
One for Goregoan, please.

116
00:08:32,367 --> 00:08:34,244
The population of
Mumbai is 225 million.'

117
00:08:34,933 --> 00:08:38,881
Which comprises of
50% male and 50% female.'

118
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,539
Meaning there are around
100 million guys in this city.'

119
00:08:42,067 --> 00:08:43,307
Yet, I am single.'

120
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:48,975
Its easier hiring a hitman to kill
someone than finding a decent guy.'

121
00:08:49,467 --> 00:08:52,073
Oh no...what if I die today?'

122
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,277
Noor Roy Chaudhary...'

123
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:58,882
Risking her life, while travelling between
Churchgate to Goregaon in the rains...'

124
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,436
...falls from the train and dies.'

125
00:09:00,533 --> 00:09:01,876
In the line of duty.'

126
00:09:01,933 --> 00:09:03,844
That too, on her birthday.'

127
00:09:04,167 --> 00:09:05,407
it will definitely
make the headlines.'

128
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,501
Do you know why?'

129
00:09:06,533 --> 00:09:09,912
Because Noor was on her way
to interview...The Sunny Leone.'

130
00:09:11,533 --> 00:09:14,514
So this is my life, and that's hers.'

131
00:09:15,033 --> 00:09:16,512
That's fame, is it?'

132
00:09:16,533 --> 00:09:19,514
Living in an ugly white box.'

133
00:09:20,067 --> 00:09:23,412
At least she's got an umbrella,
spot-boy, make-up man.'

134
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,501
What do I have?'

135
00:09:24,533 --> 00:09:26,513
Rain...and these two goons.'

136
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,907
But seriously...
what the hell am I doing here?'

137
00:09:40,233 --> 00:09:41,803
Hi, Sunny.
Thanks for joining us today.

138
00:09:42,233 --> 00:09:44,235
Thanks for coming in,
in spite of the rain.

139
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,246
And in spite of it being my birthday.

140
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:50,175
Ahh...happy binhday?
- Thanks.

141
00:09:51,167 --> 00:09:52,043
So Sunny...

142
00:09:59,033 --> 00:10:03,482
Shekhar,
who is this Noor Roy Chaudhary?

143
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,506
Get lost.

144
00:10:14,267 --> 00:10:16,804
Yup, that's my birthday cake.'

145
00:10:16,933 --> 00:10:19,311
No-no...this isn't my imagination.'

146
00:10:19,533 --> 00:10:23,208
This is actually my cake,
and my birthday party.'

147
00:10:23,267 --> 00:10:25,213
I want to create safety awareness.

148
00:10:25,267 --> 00:10:27,975
So you mean you never
take this helmet off.

149
00:10:28,533 --> 00:10:30,877
Well obviously,
when I have to wash my hair.

150
00:10:31,467 --> 00:10:35,176
Other than that...never?
- never

151
00:10:35,533 --> 00:10:36,910
Every house speaks volumes.'

152
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,911
But my house just weeps.'

153
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,179
Just like me, even my home's feelings
got washed away in tears.'

154
00:10:42,233 --> 00:10:43,405
I am Noor Roy Chaudhary..."

155
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,377
Reporting for Mumbai,
Believe It or Not.

156
00:10:50,533 --> 00:10:51,307
Hot.'

157
00:10:51,867 --> 00:10:53,471
Even the geyser's
not hot in this house.'

158
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:58,901
Hey birthday girl.

159
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,005
Oh God! Here comes Zara.
The mother I never had.'

160
00:11:03,167 --> 00:11:06,944
Noor, you look like fashion
street just puked on Linking Road.'

161
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,508
Come on, get up. Whafre you wearing.

162
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,143
Nice to see you too.

163
00:11:13,533 --> 00:11:15,444
Zara Patel. 1/3rd of me.'

164
00:11:16,233 --> 00:11:17,906
For years,
Zara's parents kept fighting...'

165
00:11:17,967 --> 00:11:19,037
...like World Ward 3.'

166
00:11:19,533 --> 00:11:21,240
So at a very young age,
Zara decided...'

167
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:23,279
...that she wasn't going
to listen to the world.'

168
00:11:25,167 --> 00:11:26,805
She would make
the world listen to her.'

169
00:11:27,167 --> 00:11:28,544
And that's what I want.' Hashtag Lifegoals

170
00:11:32,167 --> 00:11:33,077
Perfect.

171
00:11:33,433 --> 00:11:35,276
This.
- Please...

172
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:36,869
I am not going to wear
some toddler's dress.

173
00:11:36,933 --> 00:11:39,311
Excuse me, this is high fashion.

174
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,073
I bought this playsuit for you.

175
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,508
It's even called a 'Playsuif.

176
00:11:42,567 --> 00:11:45,514
Its like, I am going on a picnic to
Hanging Garden. With my lunch-box.

177
00:11:45,567 --> 00:11:46,545
Shut up!

178
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,507
Wear it with black Pumps
and red lipstick.

179
00:11:48,967 --> 00:11:53,347
And who knows, maybe some hot dude
will take you for an overnight picnic.

180
00:11:53,867 --> 00:11:54,845
Hot dude?

181
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,402
Hah! Urban legend.

182
00:11:57,167 --> 00:11:59,807
I'm not in the mood
to go anywhere today.

183
00:12:01,233 --> 00:12:03,179
Z...
- Yeah.

184
00:12:03,533 --> 00:12:06,946
Can't we stay at home
and watch Game of Thrones?

185
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,411
Absolutely not!

186
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,979
It's your birthday.

187
00:12:11,233 --> 00:12:12,371
The world will end sooner...

188
00:12:12,467 --> 00:12:13,844
...than this geyser ever getting fixed.

189
00:12:16,067 --> 00:12:17,171
No...hello...

190
00:12:18,867 --> 00:12:19,937
Bye !

191
00:12:20,467 --> 00:12:22,538
Noor, it's your birthday.

192
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,813
I am not going to let you
sit here and feel sorry for yourself.

193
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,506
I hate my life!

194
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,309
Why do you crib so much, Noor?

195
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:38,039
Why do you always see problems?

196
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,180
You must learn to
count your blessings too.

197
00:12:40,233 --> 00:12:41,473
But there are problems, Z...

198
00:12:41,533 --> 00:12:44,343
My peanut salary and
my last two stories...

199
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,540
Yuck!

200
00:12:46,533 --> 00:12:48,342
I want to get into issue-based
broadcast journalism...

201
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,811
...and look at what I am doing?

202
00:12:49,867 --> 00:12:52,370
What are you doing in Mumbai,
go to Delhi. - Please.

203
00:12:52,467 --> 00:12:54,469
People in Delhi keep groping you.

204
00:12:54,533 --> 00:12:56,513
At least someone will touch you.

205
00:12:57,867 --> 00:13:00,473
Mumbai is unexciting, Delhi is unsafe!

206
00:13:00,533 --> 00:13:03,013
Is there any place on this earth
which is exciting according to you?

207
00:13:10,933 --> 00:13:13,573
You're attracting all this
negativity in your life, Noor.

208
00:13:16,533 --> 00:13:17,910
Happy Birthday!

209
00:13:37,267 --> 00:13:40,339
Yes, Saad.
- Happy Birthday.

210
00:13:41,267 --> 00:13:43,247
Saad Sehgal! The other 1/3rd of me.'

211
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,211
Spent his childhood in London.'

212
00:13:45,267 --> 00:13:47,269
Saad's dad was a classy man.'

213
00:13:47,367 --> 00:13:50,541
He took him to the finest
restaurants in the world.'

214
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,280
When Saad was just 12,
his father passed away.'

215
00:13:53,367 --> 00:13:55,574
And his mother brought
him back to Mumbai.'

216
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:57,506
That's when the three of us met.'

217
00:13:57,533 --> 00:14:00,013
Zara, Saad and me,
we became the Three Musketeers.'

218
00:14:00,167 --> 00:14:01,168
Childhood friends.'

219
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,209
The three of us is all we need.'

220
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:05,572
Or should we say...
we three are not a crowd.'

221
00:14:07,067 --> 00:14:08,068
Back to Saad.'

222
00:14:08,433 --> 00:14:09,844
So Saad used his inheritance... '

223
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,504
To open a restaurant in London.'

224
00:14:12,167 --> 00:14:14,169
But he never took me there.'

225
00:14:14,233 --> 00:14:17,407
In fact, I am convinced
that this is just a front...'

226
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,002
...to pick up hot girls.'

227
00:14:19,367 --> 00:14:21,506
What time is it in London?
- Video.

228
00:14:21,533 --> 00:14:22,978
No.
- Why?

229
00:14:23,233 --> 00:14:24,439
Because I am ugly.

230
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,175
That bad?
- Dangerous.

231
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:30,076
Listen, switch to video...
or I'm flying down tomorrow.

232
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,510
Saad, I am really
not interested right now.

233
00:14:32,967 --> 00:14:34,537
I know you'll ask me for a tip...

234
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,801
...to break up with
one of your floozies.

235
00:14:35,867 --> 00:14:38,814
And I am not in the mood, please.
- Noor, please.

236
00:14:38,867 --> 00:14:40,175
Like I need your help.

237
00:14:40,533 --> 00:14:42,945
But seriously...one of my
ex-girlfriend staned stalking me.

238
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,343
I've no idea what to do.

239
00:14:44,433 --> 00:14:45,878
So just come here.

240
00:14:46,167 --> 00:14:47,407
It's Zara's gig as well.

241
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,207
And get me a crate
of Old Rum as well.

242
00:14:49,267 --> 00:14:51,508
Dude, I am flying down from London...
not some Army canteen!

243
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,810
Can I get you better
rum than Old Rum?

244
00:14:57,567 --> 00:15:00,980
There's no rum better than Old Rum.
- Wow...

245
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:04,246
You look interesting!

246
00:15:04,533 --> 00:15:06,274
Where's my baby?

247
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:08,176
<i>Oh 3”" Dad...</i>

248
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:09,868
I better go.

249
00:15:09,967 --> 00:15:11,378
Bye.
- Bye...see..

250
00:15:12,467 --> 00:15:14,538
Go...your papa's calling you.

251
00:15:15,033 --> 00:15:16,410
I think I am invisible
except for the fact...'

252
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:20,949
Come my baby, don't you hardly eat...

253
00:15:22,067 --> 00:15:24,047
Why does Papa pay
attention only to Dimpy?

254
00:15:24,167 --> 00:15:25,373
And why not me?

255
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,504
Dad...

256
00:15:28,533 --> 00:15:30,342
Why doesn't anything
ever get fixed in this house?

257
00:15:30,533 --> 00:15:33,139
Why do people in this
house always complain?

258
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,335
Because the geyser's
broken for three days.

259
00:15:35,533 --> 00:15:37,376
Malti was supposed
to get an Electrician.

260
00:15:37,467 --> 00:15:38,878
Let Malti come first.

261
00:15:39,067 --> 00:15:41,274
I think Malti is secretly French!

262
00:15:41,467 --> 00:15:43,208
Her work-life balance is really good.

263
00:15:43,267 --> 00:15:44,871
She works for only 4 days a week.

264
00:15:45,533 --> 00:15:50,380
She's made 'kheer' (sweet porridge).
- 'Kheer!'

265
00:15:50,433 --> 00:15:52,174
How about I get a bowl for you?

266
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,902
I hate my life!

267
00:15:58,867 --> 00:16:00,005
So this was it.'

268
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:03,444
28th year of my life
on this God-forsaken planet.'

269
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,804
You know, there are some days
when I feel I've hit rock bottom.'

270
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:10,541
In fact...I'm so low,
that there's no bottom.'

271
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,905
Except for my own bottom.'

272
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,508
And at the rate at
which it's growing...'

273
00:16:14,567 --> 00:16:16,911
...pretty soon it will
have its own pin-code.'

274
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,243
<i>Mam!</i>

275
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:27,575
Bye, dad. I am taking the spare car-key.
- Why?

276
00:16:28,533 --> 00:16:29,944
Don't ask, long story.

277
00:16:30,033 --> 00:16:31,512
Anyway, the electricity
bill and money's right there.

278
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:33,479
Remind Malti to pay it.

279
00:16:33,533 --> 00:16:36,810
All the other kids
pay online these days.

280
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,246
So how long have you
been walking on your hands?

281
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,041
About 8 months, madam.

282
00:16:45,167 --> 00:16:46,475
And you...never lose balance?

283
00:16:46,533 --> 00:16:48,240
It keeps getting better.

284
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:52,280
Actually my Guru has said...
- Just a minute. Hold on...

285
00:17:00,533 --> 00:17:00,908
Yes, what?

286
00:17:00,967 --> 00:17:03,140
Hi, Sunny.
Thanks for joining us today.

287
00:17:03,233 --> 00:17:06,009
Thanks for coming in,
in spite of the rain."

288
00:17:06,433 --> 00:17:08,504
And in spite of
being it my birthday.

289
00:17:08,867 --> 00:17:11,939
Ahh...happy binhday?
- Thanks.

290
00:17:12,033 --> 00:17:18,177
So Sunny...do you feel more accepted
in this industry after that interview?

291
00:17:18,267 --> 00:17:21,805
Yes, I do feel that...
and, I've just signed 5 movies.'

292
00:17:25,567 --> 00:17:28,173
Yes, people are taking
me more seriously.

293
00:17:28,267 --> 00:17:30,269
And I've just signed...

294
00:17:32,533 --> 00:17:34,308
What's that on the screen?
- That's me!

295
00:17:34,533 --> 00:17:35,944
What are you doing on screen?

296
00:17:36,067 --> 00:17:38,047
It's not what it looks like?
- Like what?

297
00:17:38,233 --> 00:17:41,077
It's not that I don't take
my work seriously? - Really?

298
00:17:41,533 --> 00:17:43,843
What do you think? I've some
secret debauched night life...

299
00:17:43,933 --> 00:17:46,504
...with lots of sex and drugs?
- Looking Like that?

300
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:49,436
Drugs, perhaps? Sex, doubtful.

301
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,308
Do you know what the truth is?

302
00:17:51,533 --> 00:17:52,807
You don't have any
respect for your work.

303
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,902
How can I, she's a bloody...
- She's a woman!

304
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:58,912
She's a strong woman who
accepts herself the way she is.

305
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,975
She has no regrets in life.

306
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,908
And she has totally re-invented
herself from scratch.

307
00:18:04,533 --> 00:18:05,910
And that's why I'm
not surprised that...

308
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,502
...she has the whole nation
in the palm of her hand.

309
00:18:07,533 --> 00:18:10,537
And our male population has something
else in the palm of their hands.

310
00:18:12,533 --> 00:18:14,513
First do something with your life...

311
00:18:14,967 --> 00:18:16,969
...and then judge Sunny.

312
00:18:17,867 --> 00:18:20,177
You know, honestly Shekhar...
it's not even about Sunny!

313
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:24,174
This month I've kept 6 well-researched
stories on your table...

314
00:18:24,233 --> 00:18:27,043
...which is about the real problems
of the real people of this city.

315
00:18:27,167 --> 00:18:28,908
My problem is why?

316
00:18:28,967 --> 00:18:30,537
Why are we doing the same old,
done-to-death stories...

317
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,938
...which the other media are doing?

318
00:18:32,033 --> 00:18:36,948
Because Noor...
media is the mirror of the society.

319
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:40,207
It's not my fault that
the city wants to see her...

320
00:18:41,533 --> 00:18:42,534
...and...not him.

321
00:18:48,533 --> 00:18:49,273
Hi, Saad.

322
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:49,868
Hey, Noor.

323
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,843
I can't believe that
you're saying this, Shekhar.

324
00:18:52,067 --> 00:18:54,377
Listen, I am at the airport
you were supposed to pick me up.

325
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,504
You want to do this later?
- Hold on!

326
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,004
Actually, can we?

327
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,570
Who do you think you are?

328
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,438
Where did you get this attitude?

329
00:19:04,533 --> 00:19:06,342
Were you born with it...
or did you take a class?

330
00:19:06,533 --> 00:19:08,877
I am a University topper, Shekhar.
I have brains.

331
00:19:08,967 --> 00:19:10,947
If you have a problem with us...

332
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,002
...then why do you show
your face here every day?

333
00:19:13,067 --> 00:19:13,841
Don't come.

334
00:19:13,933 --> 00:19:16,004
That's the plan...
it's what CNN wants too.

335
00:19:16,167 --> 00:19:17,441
CNN?
- Yeah...

336
00:19:17,567 --> 00:19:20,275
And they are going to
give you war-reporting...

337
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:23,211
...based on your experience in features?
- Yeah, they finally called me back.

338
00:19:25,067 --> 00:19:27,138
Good luck with that, Barkha!
- Thank you.

339
00:19:43,067 --> 00:19:45,411
Can you drive any slower?
Or we might actually get there?

340
00:19:46,433 --> 00:19:48,344
Who told you to bring the rains along?

341
00:19:48,533 --> 00:19:50,535
<i>Okay man' why you bang so Ago?</i>

342
00:19:51,367 --> 00:19:52,471
You didn't get me Old Rum either.

343
00:19:52,533 --> 00:19:56,879
A well-known CNN reporter like you
is arguing over a bottle of Old Rum.

344
00:19:57,433 --> 00:19:58,844
There's no CNN.

345
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:03,810
I lied to Shekhar.
- Are you mad or stupid?

346
00:20:04,533 --> 00:20:05,910
Apparently both.

347
00:20:07,367 --> 00:20:09,176
No BBC...No CNN..'

348
00:20:09,433 --> 00:20:10,503
I don't even have my job now.'

349
00:20:10,567 --> 00:20:14,037
Bank Balance under 155$...
and neck-deep in EMls.

350
00:20:14,167 --> 00:20:16,875
Very slim chances of
having a boyfriend now.'

351
00:20:16,933 --> 00:20:19,504
I would've been better
off married to Rahul Parekh.'

352
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,811
Rahul... Noor...

353
00:20:21,867 --> 00:20:23,278
Noor... Rahul...

354
00:20:27,533 --> 00:20:29,376
I've heard so much about you.

355
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,873
All true, I swear.

356
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:37,504
Rahul's here from Boston.

357
00:20:38,267 --> 00:20:43,410
Holiday?
- University. Economics.

358
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,979
Harvard!

359
00:20:45,267 --> 00:20:49,010
Harvard!
Meaning beauty and brains.'

360
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:51,403
Hashtag lifeset.'

361
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:54,939
I thought if not love,
at least I'll get some action.'

362
00:20:57,533 --> 00:20:59,535
With Rahul I would feel like a Diva.'

363
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,246
And this high life,
I could get used to.'

364
00:21:05,933 --> 00:21:08,539
No matter how hard I tried, but...'

365
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:13,340
it was hard to fit in
Rahul Parekh's life and Zara's jeans.'

366
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,380
Despite all of this,
marrying Rahul Parekh meant...'

367
00:21:17,467 --> 00:21:19,504
...Birkin around your arm,
coke up your nose...

368
00:21:19,533 --> 00:21:21,535
...and a 10 million
diamond around your finger.'

369
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,570
When you're getting all that...'

370
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:25,835
...you can definitely
endure some discomfort'

371
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,335
Really?
- She's gonna love you.

372
00:21:35,533 --> 00:21:37,206
Dangling chandeliers from
my ears was unbearable...'

373
00:21:37,267 --> 00:21:38,473
But I endured that as well.'

374
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,542
But tolerating his
mother...was impossible.'

375
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:44,843
So Mom, this is Noor.

376
00:21:44,933 --> 00:21:46,571
The one I told you about.

377
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:47,868
She's a...

378
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,502
She's a...good friend of mine.

379
00:21:50,567 --> 00:21:53,309
And we've been spending
a lot of time together.

380
00:21:54,367 --> 00:21:56,313
What beautiful earrings.
- Thank you, aunty...

381
00:21:56,367 --> 00:21:59,576
She's a journalist,
that's why she was late.

382
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:02,210
She has a voice...
- Yeah, of course.

383
00:22:02,267 --> 00:22:04,873
I am sure she can speak for herself.
- of course.

384
00:22:04,933 --> 00:22:07,880
So Noorie...you're a journalist.
- Noor!

385
00:22:10,267 --> 00:22:14,545
Which newspaper, Noor?
- Actually, I am a broadcast journalist.

386
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,475
And which channel are you on?

387
00:22:17,167 --> 00:22:20,273
Well it's Kind of like
a local human interest...

388
00:22:21,033 --> 00:22:22,444
No, it's more like a news agency...

389
00:22:22,533 --> 00:22:23,876
We collect news.

390
00:22:23,933 --> 00:22:26,209
We generate and provide
content for other channels here.

391
00:22:27,067 --> 00:22:29,809
Where did you study?
- Mumbai.

392
00:22:29,967 --> 00:22:33,574
Didn't your parents think about
sending you to a foreign university?

393
00:22:38,033 --> 00:22:40,172
Well I was just four
when my mother passed away...

394
00:22:40,267 --> 00:22:42,440
...and, dad couldn't afford it, so...

395
00:22:45,567 --> 00:22:47,171
Shekhar had a tendency
to consistently...

396
00:22:47,267 --> 00:22:51,374
...disrupting my barely
existent social life.'

397
00:22:51,467 --> 00:22:53,504
But that day,
for the first time in my life...'

398
00:22:53,533 --> 00:22:55,570
...he called me at the right time.'

399
00:22:55,867 --> 00:22:56,811
I am sorry, I've to take this.

400
00:22:58,033 --> 00:22:59,034
Yeah, Shekhar.

401
00:23:04,167 --> 00:23:05,009
Forget it, dude.

402
00:23:05,067 --> 00:23:08,139
Rahul Parekh is a loser.
He doesn't deserve you.

403
00:23:08,233 --> 00:23:09,405
And I say good riddance.

404
00:23:10,233 --> 00:23:12,235
Am I ever going to find anyone, Saad.

405
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:14,813
Well, for now let's
go to the an gallery.

406
00:23:14,867 --> 00:23:16,346
Mum is dying to see you.

407
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,272
Pseudo alert.

408
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:23,903
Why don't you give
this place a chance...

409
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,240
...before you star-t judging it.

410
00:23:25,867 --> 00:23:28,245
Want a drink?
- Obviously.

411
00:23:29,467 --> 00:23:31,504
Hi...two champagnes please.

412
00:23:33,467 --> 00:23:35,242
Hi, Saad.
- Hi, Maa.

413
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,402
How are you?

414
00:23:39,533 --> 00:23:40,443
What?
- what?

415
00:23:40,567 --> 00:23:41,307
Hi!

416
00:23:41,367 --> 00:23:43,074
Hi, how are you?

417
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,237
Saad didn't have
my drink in his hand...'

418
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,506
...in fact,
it was his new arm-candy.'

419
00:23:46,933 --> 00:23:47,877
Zarina.'

420
00:23:47,967 --> 00:23:49,947
She looked like she
just jumped out of...

421
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,503
...an Archie comic wearing
that A-line dress.'

422
00:23:52,567 --> 00:23:55,980
Perfect waistline,
perfect hair, perfect lips.'

423
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:58,274
Little Miss Perfect.

424
00:23:58,900 --> 00:23:59,878
It's...

425
00:23:59,933 --> 00:24:01,435
You were supposed
to get a drink for me.

426
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,207
Hi, aunty...
- Hi.

427
00:24:04,567 --> 00:24:06,979
Did you want a drink?
- About an hour ago...

428
00:24:07,067 --> 00:24:09,377
But I guess you were
busy plucking grapes.

429
00:24:09,433 --> 00:24:10,070
Thank you.

430
00:24:10,167 --> 00:24:11,373
Yeah...

431
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:14,540
ls there a problem?
- No...she's just... Jokes!

432
00:24:14,933 --> 00:24:16,037
She is a joker.

433
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,570
So pretentious.

434
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,506
Why do you say that?

435
00:24:27,167 --> 00:24:28,271
It's quite dramatic.

436
00:24:29,233 --> 00:24:30,143
Really?

437
00:24:30,233 --> 00:24:33,510
I mean the chiaroscuro
is quite powerful...

438
00:24:33,567 --> 00:24:34,545
I don't know.

439
00:24:34,867 --> 00:24:36,540
Isn't there too much negative space?

440
00:24:39,467 --> 00:24:40,844
How about this one?

441
00:24:43,067 --> 00:24:44,307
Who does this?

442
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,277
Poor guy went for a haircut.

443
00:24:46,333 --> 00:24:49,906
Never imagined someone will take such
an ugly picture of him in this condition.

444
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,570
All in the name of 'Ar-t'.

445
00:24:52,934 --> 00:24:54,038
And this...

446
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:55,345
What is this?

447
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,402
This is how foreigners
want to see our city.

448
00:24:58,033 --> 00:25:00,309
Street kids...taking a dip...
The beach...

449
00:25:00,367 --> 00:25:02,847
I mean...l am tired of all this.

450
00:25:03,233 --> 00:25:05,213
Don't you think such images...

451
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:08,543
...capture the free spirit of Mumbai.
- Ummm no...

452
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,201
I'm Ayananka Bannerjee.

453
00:25:11,233 --> 00:25:12,371
My friends call me Ayan.

454
00:25:12,867 --> 00:25:15,313
Hi Ayananka Bannerjee,
- I'm Noor Roy Chaudhary.

455
00:25:16,033 --> 00:25:18,946
At least...our names are
cooler than these pictures.

456
00:25:23,067 --> 00:25:24,341
Excuse me.

457
00:25:40,467 --> 00:25:42,538
What happened?...

458
00:25:44,034 --> 00:25:45,240
I am an idiot, Saad.

459
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,405
Well, at least you
and I agree on something.

460
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,843
What?

461
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,211
Him? Forget it...
Looks like a wannabe.

462
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,041
These are his photos.

463
00:25:53,167 --> 00:25:55,169
And I just made fun of them
in front of him.

464
00:25:56,233 --> 00:25:57,371
It's not funny, Saad.

465
00:25:57,467 --> 00:25:59,174
Well, I guess another
one bites the dust.

466
00:25:59,233 --> 00:26:01,907
Shut up...and she's the wannabe, okay.

467
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:06,177
Are you like jealous?
- Yeah, so jealous.

468
00:26:06,234 --> 00:26:08,043
Fine, come on...
- Where?

469
00:26:08,134 --> 00:26:10,273
Zara's gig, you elephant.
- you elephant.

470
00:26:10,333 --> 00:26:11,937
Don't touch me...

...cast a spell...

476
00:26:45,533 --> 00:26:47,911
My head's stuck on you...

...we're going to say it ...aloud.

We won't listen...even if...

...anyone gets furious.

500
00:29:10,967 --> 00:29:15,074
Live and let live...

They give me peanuts for a salary...

522
00:31:12,367 --> 00:31:14,540
...and send me to cover
Stupid stories...

523
00:31:14,933 --> 00:31:17,914
I got fried.
- Just Like your mom.

524
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,478
Yeah...

525
00:31:19,533 --> 00:31:22,912
If only she was alive today,
she would've been a celebrated novelist.

526
00:31:23,434 --> 00:31:25,436
Her words had that 'power' Noor.

527
00:31:26,567 --> 00:31:29,013
She even had a short-temper like you.

528
00:31:29,267 --> 00:31:31,907
The word 'patience'
Wasn't in her dictionary.

529
00:31:34,167 --> 00:31:35,475
I wish I knew her.

530
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,343
But I don't think you get it, dad.

531
00:31:39,567 --> 00:31:43,174
There's a lot I want to do in life.
- Fine...

532
00:31:43,233 --> 00:31:45,338
But there's a time
for everything, dear.

533
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,844
How can people like you
spend their entire lifetime...

534
00:31:47,933 --> 00:31:49,935
...in a dead-end government job?

535
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,512
It wasn't a dead-end job.

536
00:31:53,067 --> 00:31:55,206
It had stability.

537
00:31:56,167 --> 00:31:59,341
And I loved spending
time with your mother.

538
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,471
And in case you don't remember,
I raised you single-handedly.

539
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:11,548
Didn't you ever want to change the world?
- I didn't have to.

540
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:15,304
I've left that for you to do.

541
00:33:00,567 --> 00:33:02,274
Hey, gorgeous.
- Hi.

542
00:33:02,567 --> 00:33:05,912
How was Delhi?
- Delhi is well... Delhi.

543
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,946
Yup...Delhi is Delhi.

544
00:33:08,267 --> 00:33:11,009
So I was thinking if you're free...

545
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,273
...maybe dinner this evening?

546
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,141
Give me a second, yeah...

547
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:32,106
Aah...tonight looks tricky.
- Okay then, never mind.

548
00:33:32,233 --> 00:33:33,906
Maybe another time.
when I'm in town.

549
00:33:37,967 --> 00:33:39,002
Hold.

550
00:33:41,333 --> 00:33:44,041
I've a meeting today which
I can reschedule for tomorrow.

551
00:33:44,334 --> 00:33:45,142
That's great.

552
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,338
Drinks tonight?
- Sure.

553
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,401
What are you thinking?

554
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:51,310
Noor...the flush is broken again.

555
00:33:51,533 --> 00:33:54,946
Use the plunger like you always do.
- Dad, Please...

556
00:33:55,467 --> 00:33:57,310
Is this your room or a warzone?

557
00:33:57,367 --> 00:33:59,904
Dad, I am on a call.
- Who is it?

558
00:34:01,233 --> 00:34:05,238
Hello, young man.
I'm Noor's father and this is Dimpy.

559
00:34:06,167 --> 00:34:08,977
Say hello, Dimpy.
- Hello, sir. Hello, Dimpy.

560
00:34:09,267 --> 00:34:12,180
Yeahmbye, Dad.
- Okay-okay. I'm leaving.

561
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,909
I am really sorry about that.

562
00:34:15,967 --> 00:34:18,174
Well, looks like you
can use a drink right now.

563
00:34:18,233 --> 00:34:20,008
Yeah...badly.

564
00:34:26,433 --> 00:34:27,912
<i>Mam!</i>

565
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,006
That was quick!
- Yeah...cold shower.

566
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:37,478
Takes just a minute...and Malti
hasn't gotten the geyser fixed.

567
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:42,405
Malti? - You don't know, Malti?
You must meet Malti...

568
00:34:42,467 --> 00:34:47,143
In fact, even I want to meet Malti.
- Drink?

569
00:34:47,233 --> 00:34:47,973
Sure.

570
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:56,341
Cheers to Malti.
- To Malti.

571
00:35:01,067 --> 00:35:04,537
So I Googled you.
- you Googled me?

572
00:35:04,867 --> 00:35:07,905
Yeah...everyone these
days Google each other.

573
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,506
And you're a war photo-journalist, with bloody CNN.
- I was...

574
00:35:13,233 --> 00:35:16,976
But now I sell my stories and photographs
to different agencies and syndicates.

575
00:35:17,167 --> 00:35:18,168
I prefer the freedom.

576
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,173
So what brings you from
that warzone to this one?

577
00:35:21,867 --> 00:35:24,211
Persis, the owner of
the An Gallery is a friend.

578
00:35:24,267 --> 00:35:28,181
She wanted to showcase
some of my work, so...here I am.

579
00:35:28,434 --> 00:35:31,506
Yeah, your work...is beautiful.

580
00:35:31,867 --> 00:35:35,974
And I am very sorry that I said way too much...
- No need for the politeness.

581
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:37,435
Oops...

582
00:35:37,967 --> 00:35:40,140
When I was asked to
exhibit my photographs...

583
00:35:40,233 --> 00:35:42,975
...I was like...
This is really serious stuff.

584
00:35:43,067 --> 00:35:46,173
You know, if you try to look...

585
00:35:46,234 --> 00:35:48,111
...you'll find a hidden
city inside every city.

586
00:35:48,167 --> 00:35:50,169
And I like exploring these hidden cities.

587
00:35:50,234 --> 00:35:52,908
So you never exhibited
your war photographs?

588
00:36:00,234 --> 00:36:06,241
Exhibiting that kind of pain and suffering...
on an artistic platform...

589
00:36:06,567 --> 00:36:08,274
Doesn't seem right.

590
00:36:10,934 --> 00:36:12,277
I've some really bad memories.

591
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:14,970
I am done with war.

592
00:36:16,134 --> 00:36:18,011
The lives of people
have no value anymore.

593
00:36:18,434 --> 00:36:22,405
And anyway, what difference do the
photos and stories of a journalist make?

594
00:36:22,967 --> 00:36:24,207
Does anything change?

595
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,101
Nothing.

596
00:36:32,867 --> 00:36:35,473
I lost a...very good friend in Iraq.

597
00:36:37,234 --> 00:36:39,236
We were in Baghdad.

598
00:36:39,567 --> 00:36:40,944
Reporting live.

599
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,244
We saw Saddam's statue fall.

600
00:36:44,934 --> 00:36:46,311
In the middle of Firdaus Square.

601
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,880
I took a bullet for that story.

602
00:36:49,467 --> 00:36:55,941
But my friend...he lost his life.
- God, I am sorry.

603
00:36:56,434 --> 00:36:57,970
You've really seen a lot, huh.

604
00:36:59,934 --> 00:37:03,882
Look...journalism has
two schools of thought.

605
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,909
First; Ground work and research.

606
00:37:05,967 --> 00:37:08,208
Second; Right place, right time.

607
00:37:08,433 --> 00:37:11,073
There's just ground work
and research in my life.

608
00:37:11,234 --> 00:37:14,078
Right place,
right time is not my destiny.

609
00:37:14,867 --> 00:37:18,007
Meaning I am a journalist as well.

610
00:37:18,367 --> 00:37:19,539
Really?
- Really.

611
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:20,970
Get out of here.
- No.

612
00:37:21,067 --> 00:37:23,104
What kind of stuff?
- Can't tell you.

613
00:37:24,167 --> 00:37:26,511
Why?
- It's really embarrassing.

614
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,140
Come on, tell me.
- okay.

615
00:37:31,034 --> 00:37:32,274
You know, there's a woman in Bandra...

616
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:36,543
...who wears her motorcycle helmet 24/7.
- That's interesting.

617
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:39,176
Or, there's a man
in Bhiwandi who's sworn...

618
00:37:39,234 --> 00:37:41,236
...to walk on his hands for a year.

619
00:37:41,933 --> 00:37:44,971
You know I've so many stories
backed up by so much research...

620
00:37:45,067 --> 00:37:47,013
...but, no one cares.

621
00:37:47,234 --> 00:37:49,475
Ayananka Banerjee.
Ex-CNN reporter.'

622
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:52,214
Strong but sensitive.'

623
00:37:52,267 --> 00:37:54,873
Was I really getting
a second chance.'

624
00:37:56,067 --> 00:37:57,569
Let's have a real drink?
- Yeah.

625
00:37:57,933 --> 00:37:59,207
Rum.
- Yeah.

626
00:37:59,234 --> 00:38:01,111
Old Rum?
- Oh my, God...l love Old Rum.

627
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,181
In fact, my friend Saad
calls me 'Rum-bacchant.'

628
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:13,104
Nothings changed
without a reason...

629
00:38:13,234 --> 00:38:15,009
There's definitely a reason...

630
00:38:15,234 --> 00:38:16,235
Listen...

631
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:20,904
I am standing still...
and the path's walking ahead...

632
00:38:21,234 --> 00:38:22,941
There's magic in the air...

633
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:24,235
Listen...

634
00:38:24,567 --> 00:38:28,481
You're with me...

635
00:38:28,534 --> 00:38:32,243
...everything seems new.

636
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:36,107
Am I dreaming about you...

637
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:40,114
...or is that really
your face in front of my eyes?

638
00:38:42,234 --> 00:38:45,511
That thing which is called love.

639
00:38:46,234 --> 00:38:48,236
It's what I feel for you.

640
00:38:50,234 --> 00:38:53,238
That thing which is called love.

641
00:38:54,234 --> 00:38:57,044
It's what I feel for you.

642
00:39:32,967 --> 00:39:33,445
Drink?

643
00:39:34,334 --> 00:39:36,837
Old Monk and coke please.
- Diet coke.

644
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,008
Diet coke!

645
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:47,077
You know...whenever there's
a new guy in the scene...

646
00:39:47,167 --> 00:39:48,510
...you shift to diet coke.

647
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,307
So...where is this
Imaginary boyfriend?

648
00:39:53,534 --> 00:39:56,140
We were supposed to meet
for coffee...but he ditched.

649
00:39:56,234 --> 00:39:59,306
Which is why I've to sit on
this stool and watch your ugly face?

650
00:39:59,367 --> 00:40:05,374
Okay...next time when he calls, please
don't follow him like a puppy dog.

651
00:40:05,434 --> 00:40:06,504
Try to be unavailable.

652
00:40:06,867 --> 00:40:08,210
Did I ask for your advice? No, right?

653
00:40:08,267 --> 00:40:10,008
If you had,
you would've been on a date instead.

654
00:40:10,234 --> 00:40:13,340
You never want me to settle down.
- Hello soap-queen.

655
00:40:13,467 --> 00:40:16,414
First go for coffee with him,
then we can talk about settling down.

656
00:40:17,034 --> 00:40:18,240
Whenever I star-t dating a new guy...

657
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,904
...you really can't take it.

658
00:40:20,234 --> 00:40:22,145
Date? That Ayaan?

659
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,202
That Pseudo.
Does he even know you're dating him?

660
00:40:27,267 --> 00:40:28,473
Act like an adult.

661
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,035
What. . .what. <i>..</i>

662
00:40:30,267 --> 00:40:31,541
What if I...

663
00:40:32,134 --> 00:40:33,943
I will...kill you...

664
00:40:35,334 --> 00:40:36,335
Okay...

665
00:40:43,267 --> 00:40:47,215
Why does it feel like...

666
00:40:47,234 --> 00:40:51,205
...you're flying in the air.

667
00:40:51,234 --> 00:40:55,205
There's love in
the air all around...

668
00:40:55,234 --> 00:40:58,238
...I can feel that.

669
00:40:58,334 --> 00:41:01,474
Since you arrived...

670
00:41:01,567 --> 00:41:05,014
...you made my hear-t beat again.

671
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:07,580
He found me on Facebook.
- Show me.

672
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,573
He's 40.

673
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,106
And... the salt and pepper looks
really good on him.

674
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,077
I think he sent a text.

675
00:41:13,167 --> 00:41:16,307
Show me.
God. I am fat, and I hate my life.

676
00:41:16,433 --> 00:41:18,970
Say it. I am thin. I love my life.

677
00:41:19,067 --> 00:41:22,014
I am thin. I love my life.
- okay.

678
00:41:22,167 --> 00:41:24,238
Like it's going to make a difference.

679
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,209
See, it works.

680
00:41:38,434 --> 00:41:41,074
That thing which is called love.

681
00:41:42,467 --> 00:41:45,038
It's what I feel for you.

682
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,846
That thing which is called love.

683
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,847
It's what I feel for you.

684
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,914
The ambiance feels
close to my hear-t...

685
00:42:13,967 --> 00:42:17,881
...what seemed like a stranger to me.

686
00:42:17,934 --> 00:42:21,575
This journey's taking me ahead...

687
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:24,540
...and there's no to turning back.

688
00:42:24,867 --> 00:42:28,178
All my desires...

689
00:42:28,333 --> 00:42:32,110
...and these wishes.

690
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:36,077
You heard them...

691
00:42:36,167 --> 00:42:40,343
...like God answers a prayer.

692
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:46,071
That thing which is called love.

693
00:42:46,133 --> 00:42:48,238
It's what I feel for you.

694
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:53,981
That thing which is called love.

695
00:42:54,033 --> 00:42:56,309
It's what I feel for you.

696
00:42:57,967 --> 00:43:01,847
That thing which is called love.

697
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:04,176
It's what I feel for you.

698
00:43:06,134 --> 00:43:08,307
What are you doing with your life?

699
00:43:11,267 --> 00:43:13,076
How's your new job?

700
00:43:14,534 --> 00:43:16,343
So full of shit

701
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,002
You want to do serious journalism,
don't you?

702
00:43:20,534 --> 00:43:21,535
Start With this.

703
00:43:22,567 --> 00:43:24,103
There's a Dr. Dilip Shinde.

704
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:27,113
He's star-ted a new scheme
for the under-privileged.

705
00:43:27,367 --> 00:43:28,971
He'll treat the poor for free.

706
00:43:29,334 --> 00:43:31,974
Whether its cancer
or open-head surgery.

707
00:43:32,234 --> 00:43:34,976
He's going to do...what
the government is not doing.

708
00:43:35,034 --> 00:43:38,208
This Dr. Shinde works
for the Kapadia Trust - So?

709
00:43:38,234 --> 00:43:40,544
So Kapadia Trust means the
Trust owned by your wife's family...

710
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:41,935
Is this even ethical?

711
00:43:42,033 --> 00:43:42,977
That's irrelevant.

712
00:43:43,367 --> 00:43:46,246
One...Shinde's doing
a good thing for the poor.

713
00:43:46,467 --> 00:43:49,346
Two...this is a very good story...

714
00:43:50,467 --> 00:43:54,244
...which is about the real problems
of the real people of this city.

715
00:43:56,167 --> 00:43:57,168
Do you want to do it?

716
00:44:42,833 --> 00:44:44,176
Dr. Shinde, Hi! Noor Roy Chaudhary.

717
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:44,940
Hello.

718
00:44:45,034 --> 00:44:46,513
Shall we do the interview here?

719
00:44:47,034 --> 00:44:49,878
Here is fine.
- so Can I call my camera crew? - please.

720
00:44:50,267 --> 00:44:54,079
So Dr. Shinde, what was your
motive behind initiating this scheme?

721
00:44:54,167 --> 00:44:56,943
To continue our efforts
to help the poor.

722
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,002
And support such schemes.

723
00:44:59,267 --> 00:45:02,908
Here in the clinic, we don't just
give regular treatments, in fact...

724
00:45:04,267 --> 00:45:07,874
Here in the clinic, we don't just
give regular treatments, in fact...

725
00:45:08,534 --> 00:45:10,343
For example, kidney stone.

726
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:12,335
Didi...

727
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:18,340
Where are you going, Malti?
- I have To take my brother for a checkup.

728
00:45:18,434 --> 00:45:20,141
Please clean the room first.

729
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:31,275
Malti.
- Yeah.

730
00:45:31,334 --> 00:45:34,247
You fixed the geyser, thank you.

731
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:35,244
Yes, Didi.

732
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:41,047
Wow! Hot water!

733
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,471
What would I have
done without you, Malti?

734
00:45:48,867 --> 00:45:52,371
Here in the clinic, we don't just
do regular treatments, in fact...

735
00:45:53,134 --> 00:45:55,239
For example, kidney stone.

736
00:45:55,934 --> 00:45:58,972
In fact, we even treat cataract.

737
00:46:00,934 --> 00:46:04,939
Do you believe this
scheme will be a success?

738
00:46:38,934 --> 00:46:39,844
<i>Mam?</i>

739
00:46:43,234 --> 00:46:44,144
<i>Mam, What...</i>

740
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:45,438
You're crying?

741
00:46:46,067 --> 00:46:46,875
What happened?

742
00:46:51,067 --> 00:46:53,343
He's a very bad man.
- what?

743
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:56,870
He's a bad man.
- Dr. Shinde?

744
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,202
What doctor? He's a butcher.

745
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:01,444
What are you saying?
Tell me properly.

746
00:47:03,267 --> 00:47:08,444
This man...promised
to give my brother a job.

747
00:47:08,533 --> 00:47:09,375
But...

748
00:47:12,334 --> 00:47:14,473
Malti...tell me properly.

749
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:16,977
I'm here... tell me.

750
00:47:17,034 --> 00:47:18,445
He promised to give
my brother a job...

751
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:21,106
...but he stole his kidney instead.
- what?

752
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,880
I am really worried.

753
00:47:27,367 --> 00:47:28,937
I don't know what's going to happen.

754
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:33,940
Where is Vilas now?
- At home.

755
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:36,002
Come on, take me to him.

756
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:37,170
Get up...come on.
- You're coming.

757
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,201
Yes...come on.

758
00:47:40,134 --> 00:47:40,908
Come on.

759
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:47,979
Z...you're not going to believe this.
I got my story.

760
00:47:48,167 --> 00:47:49,942
It's a really big
organ-harvesting scam.

761
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,138
I am going to expose it.

762
00:47:51,934 --> 00:47:53,538
Careful, Noor.
- Yes, Z...l wasn't born yesterday.

763
00:47:54,034 --> 00:47:55,536
Anyway, I've got to go now,
I am driving.

764
00:47:55,867 --> 00:47:56,868
I'll talk to you later.

765
00:48:00,967 --> 00:48:06,280
What are you going to do?
- I want To help you.

766
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,201
Don't worry.

767
00:48:57,067 --> 00:48:57,875
Vilas.

768
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:02,172
Vilas. Didi here to see you.

769
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:08,210
Do you want the pot?
- no...

770
00:49:08,334 --> 00:49:09,813
Down...down...
- you have...

771
00:49:17,367 --> 00:49:21,941
Vilas. Tell me how this happened?

772
00:49:22,034 --> 00:49:23,069
...he...

773
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:29,346
Let him rest.
- No, he's speaking Malti.

774
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,310
Let him speak.

775
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:31,345
Tell me, Vilas.

776
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:35,147
That Shinde...
promised me a job.

777
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:37,508
He said he'll give me a job.

778
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:42,147
But he stole my kidney instead.

779
00:49:42,267 --> 00:49:44,213
Dr. Shinde did this?
- Yes...

780
00:49:45,533 --> 00:49:47,843
He will kill us.

781
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:50,802
He could kill you too.

782
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,378
Turn this off...
- I am...l am...

783
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,907
This is a huge scam, Malti.

784
00:50:00,367 --> 00:50:02,369
We must bring it to the media.

785
00:50:02,434 --> 00:50:04,846
No. I don't want this camera.

786
00:50:05,067 --> 00:50:07,877
Malti, I will need
your interview for this.

787
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:15,410
Malti. I am here...l won't
let anything happen to you.

788
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,138
Ready?
" Huh?

789
00:50:20,533 --> 00:50:22,137
Ready?
- Do I speak?

790
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:24,202
Yes...tell me from the
Beginning...

791
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:36,509
A month ago we shifted from Colaba's
Machimaar slums to the Mankhurd, SRA.

792
00:50:37,067 --> 00:50:39,946
So...earlier,
my brother had a job in Colaba.

793
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:43,181
So when we came here,
he had to quit.

794
00:50:43,267 --> 00:50:46,339
He was looking for a job,
when he learnt that...

795
00:50:46,434 --> 00:50:53,443
...Dr. Shinde recently opened his
new clinic, and he needed male-nurses.

796
00:50:53,534 --> 00:50:58,415
So...he interviewed him and said...

797
00:50:58,867 --> 00:51:02,178
...he needed to do a medical-checkup.

798
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:08,981
And...if he passed
He'd get the job.

799
00:51:10,134 --> 00:51:10,976
Then what?

800
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:16,445
They said that my brother
had a stone in his kidney.

801
00:51:16,934 --> 00:51:19,073
They said would need
to operate on him.

802
00:51:19,434 --> 00:51:22,881
They said that the
operation would be free.

803
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,975
We said...okay...

804
00:51:26,433 --> 00:51:29,346
You'll get our blessings...
for this good deed.

805
00:51:29,833 --> 00:51:32,074
After that...
two days later we came home.

806
00:51:32,967 --> 00:51:36,346
Vilas had high fever...
he was very sick.

807
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,141
He was feeling nauseous.

808
00:51:38,467 --> 00:51:40,447
So I called them up.

809
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:41,501
They said...

810
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,311
They didn't reply.

811
00:51:44,367 --> 00:51:50,215
There's a doctor in our neighborhood,
and so I took Vilas to him.

812
00:51:50,434 --> 00:51:51,469
What did the doctor say?

813
00:51:58,534 --> 00:52:04,109
He said...my brother's kidney
has been removed.

814
00:52:06,834 --> 00:52:11,442
Didn't you talk to Shinde?
- I asked him...

815
00:52:14,167 --> 00:52:18,274
But he said if we tell anyone,
he will shut us up.

816
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,437
Shinde threatened you personally.

817
00:52:23,833 --> 00:52:26,279
He said he will kill us.

818
00:52:30,034 --> 00:52:33,379
And anyway, people like us
have no value in this huge city.

819
00:52:38,067 --> 00:52:41,071
Even if we disappear tomorrow,
it won't make a difference to anyone.

820
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:58,273
Didi. What are you
going to do with this?

821
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,241
Dude, plug this in
and open the video file.

822
00:53:13,834 --> 00:53:14,972
Shekhar...please come here.

823
00:53:15,067 --> 00:53:16,842
I must show you something.
- Now?

824
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:18,004
Yes, now!

825
00:53:19,234 --> 00:53:21,407
Your Dr. Shinde is a thief...
he's a butcher.

826
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:23,002
Come and watch this.

827
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:24,469
Pia'!-

828
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:28,141
That Shinde...
promised to give me a job.

829
00:53:28,534 --> 00:53:30,207
He said he'll give me a job.

830
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:34,540
But he stole my kidney instead.

831
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,411
I asked him...

832
00:53:37,467 --> 00:53:44,385
But he said if we tell anyone,
he will shut us up.

833
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:50,311
You do understand what this is?

834
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:54,179
This is a huge scam, Shekhar.
We must expose this.

835
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,536
Noor, do you even
know what you're saying.

836
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:01,176
And these people...

837
00:54:01,234 --> 00:54:03,236
Who are they?
What are they saying?

838
00:54:03,334 --> 00:54:06,508
That Shinde is pan of
an organ-harvesting racket!

839
00:54:08,067 --> 00:54:10,047
I sent you to do a positive story.

840
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:11,470
What is this?

841
00:54:11,834 --> 00:54:13,939
This is a huge story, Shekhar.

842
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:15,938
And we've got a lead on it.

843
00:54:16,033 --> 00:54:17,410
No one else has this story.

844
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:21,211
A few years ago you would've played
this story with no questions asked.

845
00:54:21,467 --> 00:54:22,468
Where are your...

846
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:26,072
Do you have any?

847
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:32,845
Shekhar,
didn't you hear what Malti said?

848
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:34,174
He's threatening her.

849
00:54:34,367 --> 00:54:36,904
Does your source know the consequences
of doing a story like this?

850
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:38,941
How it's going to affect her life?

851
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,172
Yes, obviously she does.

852
00:54:40,234 --> 00:54:41,804
That's why I am here.

853
00:54:43,867 --> 00:54:46,347
Let me think about it.
Mail it to me.

854
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,271
This is 'gold' Shekhar,
don't sit on it.

855
00:54:49,334 --> 00:54:50,312
Monday.

856
00:54:51,134 --> 00:54:52,238
Pia'!-

857
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,838
Can you believe what I found, Z?

858
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:57,176
I knew you'd find your story.

859
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:58,474
I am so charged up.

860
00:54:58,867 --> 00:55:01,177
But that stupid Shekhar
needs to move his butt on it.

861
00:55:01,267 --> 00:55:03,338
Anyway, I got to go...call you later.

862
00:55:03,434 --> 00:55:05,345
Meeting, Ayaan?
- Yup.

863
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:07,241
Please touch-up your lipstick.

864
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:10,008
Please...Mommy. Bye.

865
00:55:15,234 --> 00:55:16,975
Hi.
- Hey, gorgeous.

866
00:55:17,067 --> 00:55:19,069
How are you?
- Very well, how Are you?

867
00:55:19,167 --> 00:55:20,407
Good.

868
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:24,171
You've got to have to see this.

869
00:55:25,067 --> 00:55:26,239
Here. Watch this.

870
00:55:27,867 --> 00:55:31,440
That Shinde...
promised to give me a job.

871
00:55:31,834 --> 00:55:34,212
He said he'll give me a job.

872
00:55:34,867 --> 00:55:38,405
But he stole my kidney instead.

873
00:55:39,867 --> 00:55:43,405
Didn't you ask Shinde?
- I asked him...

874
00:55:44,867 --> 00:55:51,250
But he said if we tell anyone,
he will shut us up.

875
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:53,846
Who is she?
- Malti.

876
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:55,538
<i>Maw'?
- Mam!</i>

877
00:55:55,867 --> 00:55:57,869
<i>Maw.
- Mam!</i>

878
00:55:57,967 --> 00:56:02,006
And this Shinde...from Kapadia Trust.
- you know him.

879
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:05,047
I've heard about him.
Dr. Shinde...Kapadia Trust...

880
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:07,046
They are powerful people.
- Exactly.

881
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,146
That's why Shekhar Das
is sitting on such a big story...

882
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,235
...and laying e995-

883
00:56:11,134 --> 00:56:12,977
Says he'll get back to me on Monday.

884
00:56:13,334 --> 00:56:14,438
So you've got the report.

885
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:18,111
It's getting done...
my editor's working on it.

886
00:56:18,167 --> 00:56:20,909
When does it go on-air?
- you think It should, right?

887
00:56:20,967 --> 00:56:23,038
Of course...in fact, right now.

888
00:56:23,267 --> 00:56:24,507
This is serious stuff.

889
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:29,042
But I guess you must
wait for two days.

890
00:56:29,934 --> 00:56:31,277
But...from the look of it...

891
00:56:31,933 --> 00:56:36,109
...seems like you're going
to expose a serious racket.

892
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,206
God, you're hot!

893
00:56:44,134 --> 00:56:45,238
Let's get out of here.

894
00:57:22,167 --> 00:57:24,044
He'! gorgeous...

895
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:33,081
You know I've never seen
anything like this before.

896
00:57:37,067 --> 00:57:38,978
You're lucky.

897
00:57:39,267 --> 00:57:41,213
Can't believe this is happening.

898
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:53,843
Are you for real?
- We better Do this again tonight.

899
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:55,406
Just to be sure.

900
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:19,176
Listenmyou won't
get over this hangover easily.

901
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:22,201
Take the day off.

902
00:58:23,867 --> 00:58:27,212
Have some breakfast,
sit at the poolside...get a massage.

903
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:29,304
Pamper yourself.

904
00:58:31,067 --> 00:58:32,239
I'll see you.

905
00:59:36,867 --> 00:59:40,440
Hi, Z - Noor, where are you?
- I couldn't sleep all night, So I just crashed.

906
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:42,309
I called you like 10 times, Noor.

907
00:59:42,367 --> 00:59:44,369
Just calm down, Z...
I'll tell you everything.

908
00:59:44,434 --> 00:59:46,209
Forget that. Listen to me...

909
00:59:46,267 --> 00:59:49,271
Ayaan stole your story and
posted it online.

910
00:59:50,034 --> 00:59:51,240
Turn on the TV.

911
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,037
I'll call you back, Z...
- It's difficult to say anything yet...

912
00:59:56,134 --> 00:59:58,341
...but if we find hard evidence...

913
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:02,348
...then, it will expose
a very influential family.

914
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:07,144
And prove that Kapadias
are behind this organ harvesting scam.

915
01:00:07,234 --> 01:00:09,805
Who could imagine that an
organization like the Kapadias...

916
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:11,311
...could be involved in such things.

917
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,503
Of course, I was working
on this story for months.

918
01:01:02,833 --> 01:01:06,246
In fact, it's a grave
crime to sit on such a story.

919
01:01:06,367 --> 01:01:09,246
You know, Malti and Vilas
Tambe are just one of the many cases.

920
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:13,976
I am sure the Kapadias
are involved in many such cases.

921
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:17,543
We shouldn't have waited.

922
01:01:19,167 --> 01:01:20,168
Story has gone viral.

923
01:01:20,867 --> 01:01:22,312
This was my story.

924
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:25,107
MY big break!

925
01:01:25,367 --> 01:01:28,280
It's trending on my timeline,
but no one knows this is my story.

926
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:30,404
All because of you.

927
01:01:31,467 --> 01:01:35,142
And my career...is finished!

928
01:01:36,067 --> 01:01:38,445
All because of you!

929
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:39,444
Because of me?

930
01:01:40,234 --> 01:01:44,182
Are you sure there's no contribution
from 'Dashing Mr.Ayaan Bannerjee'?

931
01:01:49,067 --> 01:01:50,307
There's a word called Research'.

932
01:01:50,367 --> 01:01:51,903
Maybe you've heard about it.

933
01:01:52,067 --> 01:01:54,308
Most journalists give
a lot of importance to it.

934
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,345
Your Ayaan Bannerjee is a conman.

935
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:05,075
But don't worry,
you're not the first he's conned.

936
01:02:06,934 --> 01:02:09,278
If we had played this story on time...

937
01:02:09,334 --> 01:02:11,177
...this would've never happened, Shekhar!

938
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:14,181
The reason I didn't run this story,
because I knew...

939
01:02:14,533 --> 01:02:16,069
...this is going to happen.

940
01:02:17,434 --> 01:02:19,038
You didn't think even once...

941
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:23,512
...that your stupidity could
ruin Malti and Vilas' life.

942
01:02:24,133 --> 01:02:26,374
Don't you have a conscience,
some ethics?

943
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:28,207
You're still thinking
about your career.

944
01:02:28,967 --> 01:02:32,176
When you were shooting Vilas...
recording that place...

945
01:02:33,067 --> 01:02:36,276
Did you even once think that
you should get Vilas a doctor?

946
01:02:37,267 --> 01:02:38,337
News runs in a cycle.

947
01:02:39,067 --> 01:02:40,045
The story will run for two days...

948
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:41,135
...on the third day,
it'll be a ticker.

949
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:42,178
On the fourth day it will be out.

950
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:47,212
But the lives you ruined...
will never change.

951
01:02:48,534 --> 01:02:52,243
Yes, you're intelligent...
and you've a nose for news.

952
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:56,348
But as journalist,
we've certain responsibilities as well.

953
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:59,077
Anyone can display courage
in the heat of the moment.

954
01:02:59,834 --> 01:03:01,006
But acting patiently...

955
01:03:01,167 --> 01:03:02,373
...is not everyone's cup of tea.

956
01:03:03,267 --> 01:03:06,180
And that's the difference between
an amateur and a professional.

957
01:03:07,834 --> 01:03:09,507
You forgot a basic rule, Noor.

958
01:03:11,834 --> 01:03:15,179
We're not just journalists...
we're humans too.

959
01:03:20,067 --> 01:03:20,545
Now get out!

960
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:22,470
Shekhar...

961
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:25,506
This time it's final.

962
01:03:34,867 --> 01:03:35,470
Get out!

963
01:03:47,867 --> 01:03:48,538
<i>Mam!</i>

964
01:03:49,267 --> 01:03:50,405
<i>Mam!</i>

965
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:53,406
<i>Mam!</i>

966
01:04:13,467 --> 01:04:16,209
Yes, dad?
- Noor, Are you alright?

967
01:04:16,367 --> 01:04:17,311
Where are you?

968
01:04:17,367 --> 01:04:18,846
Who is Shinde?

969
01:04:19,034 --> 01:04:20,308
He called me...

970
01:04:20,367 --> 01:04:22,278
He was saying "keep Noor
away from these things".

971
01:04:22,334 --> 01:04:24,075
Otherwise she will have to regret.

972
01:04:24,167 --> 01:04:25,544
Away from what, Noor?

973
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:30,039
Come home, now.
- Coming.

974
01:04:33,467 --> 01:04:36,107
No, Didi...but I don't want this camera.'

975
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:37,474
When you were shooting Vilas...'

976
01:04:37,834 --> 01:04:40,542
'Did you even once think
that you should get Vilas a doctor?'

977
01:04:40,867 --> 01:04:43,006
Didi! What are you
going to do with this?'

978
01:04:43,100 --> 01:04:48,140
You forgot a basic rule. We're not
just journalists...we're humans too.'

979
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:50,111
Didi, he Will kill us.'

980
01:04:50,167 --> 01:04:52,169
Malti, I am here for you.'

981
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:54,846
I won't let anything happen to you.'

982
01:05:18,534 --> 01:05:19,512
Saad...

983
01:05:20,167 --> 01:05:23,046
For three days she hasn't
eaten or said a word.

984
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:25,107
Don't worry, uncle.

985
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:27,439
It will take time,
but she will bounce back.

986
01:05:29,167 --> 01:05:30,271
Thank you for coming.

987
01:05:32,867 --> 01:05:34,175
I figured this was pretty bad.

988
01:05:35,234 --> 01:05:38,147
Uncle, do you have any
idea who made that threat call?

989
01:05:38,367 --> 01:05:39,505
Don't know.

990
01:05:40,434 --> 01:05:44,075
But the way he sounded,
I was scared Saad.

991
01:05:44,934 --> 01:05:49,383
Until this doesn't settle down,
please take Noor away.

992
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:53,208
Any news about Malti?

993
01:05:55,533 --> 01:05:59,379
This is a police case now.
They are looking for her and her brother.

994
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:06,338
You try...I'll make coffee for everyone.
- okay.

995
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:12,137
Hey...sleepyhead...up!

996
01:06:15,434 --> 01:06:16,913
What are you doing here, Saad?

997
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,536
Get up or I will switch off the AC.

998
01:06:19,034 --> 01:06:23,210
You've 10 minutes,
then we've a flight to catch.

999
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:26,201
I am not going anywhere.

1000
01:06:28,467 --> 01:06:30,378
You don't understand
what's happened, Saad.

1001
01:06:34,267 --> 01:06:37,043
I went to check
if Malti's brother was 0k, and...

1002
01:06:41,234 --> 01:06:42,907
I do understand what happened.

1003
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:45,401
You really don't.

1004
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,877
What have I done, Saad?

1005
01:06:50,567 --> 01:06:56,449
I don't know where they took Vilas, and Malti...
is she even safe?

1006
01:06:57,400 --> 01:07:00,074
But is there anything
you can do about it?

1007
01:07:00,867 --> 01:07:04,007
Look...l understand what
you're going through.

1008
01:07:04,100 --> 01:07:07,240
And I also know that you
want everything to be fine again.

1009
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:09,246
But Noor, they are dangerous people.

1010
01:07:09,367 --> 01:07:11,142
You're getting threat calls.

1011
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:14,004
You're dad is really worried.

1012
01:07:15,100 --> 01:07:16,977
So please...just once...

1013
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:20,480
Only once...think about him,
and not yourself.

1014
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:24,201
0K8'!-

1015
01:07:31,134 --> 01:07:35,446
As soon as I get any news about Malti,
I'll let you know.

1016
01:07:37,034 --> 01:07:38,035
I promise.

1017
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:46,647
Sometimes I feel...

1018
01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:50,507
...this is the way it had to be.

1019
01:07:50,567 --> 01:07:54,208
It's important for the...

1020
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:57,403
...the winds to change it's course.

1021
01:07:58,434 --> 01:08:02,211
Sometimes I feel...

1022
01:08:02,267 --> 01:08:05,942
...I got what I deserved.

1023
01:08:06,034 --> 01:08:10,073
It's important for the...

1024
01:08:10,234 --> 01:08:13,147
...desires to shatter.

1025
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:17,447
For he was the one...

1026
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:21,471
<i>...l</i> moved heaven and earth.

1027
01:08:21,534 --> 01:08:27,416
But the distances prevailed.

1028
01:08:28,334 --> 01:08:35,149
Because it's important
to cry secretly.

1029
01:08:36,234 --> 01:08:38,510
It's important for the
eyes to brim with tears.

1030
01:09:04,234 --> 01:09:10,207
Those who would...
wait for me eagerly.

1031
01:09:10,234 --> 01:09:12,009
Didi, he Will kill us.'

1032
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:19,177
I snatched the light
from those eyes.

1033
01:09:19,567 --> 01:09:23,105
What was mine...

1034
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:26,545
...was never mine.

1035
01:09:27,534 --> 01:09:30,981
What is this game...

1036
01:09:31,267 --> 01:09:34,544
...that time played with me.

1037
01:09:35,134 --> 01:09:39,014
I've never seen smoke...

1038
01:09:39,067 --> 01:09:42,310
...rising from snow for anyone.

1039
01:09:42,967 --> 01:09:49,213
The distances prevailed.

1040
01:09:49,567 --> 01:09:56,985
Because it's important
to cry secretly.

1041
01:09:57,267 --> 01:10:04,446
It's sometime important
for this to happen.

1042
01:10:13,234 --> 01:10:14,542
When are we going back home?

1043
01:10:14,901 --> 01:10:17,973
Never.
- I am serious, Saad.

1044
01:10:18,234 --> 01:10:19,269
Why did you bring me here?

1045
01:10:19,334 --> 01:10:20,904
Well, I had just two options.

1046
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,503
Either I could've brought you
to London, or give you one tight slap.

1047
01:10:25,234 --> 01:10:29,307
Okay, who are you?
And what have you done to my friend.

1048
01:10:31,434 --> 01:10:33,914
Your friend is a very selfish girl.

1049
01:10:36,434 --> 01:10:38,937
You know this self pity,
doesn't suit you.

1050
01:10:40,567 --> 01:10:43,047
I don't know,
maybe this isn't meant for me.

1051
01:10:43,134 --> 01:10:45,205
What? Love or journalism?

1052
01:10:45,534 --> 01:10:46,308
Both.

1053
01:10:46,367 --> 01:10:48,108
Okay, what has happened to you?

1054
01:10:48,201 --> 01:10:51,944
The Noor I knew...
never talked like a loser.

1055
01:10:52,001 --> 01:10:53,571
Then just get used to it, Saad?

1056
01:10:54,067 --> 01:10:56,411
Did you think I'd' come
to London and party?

1057
01:10:57,034 --> 01:11:00,379
My ambition had become more
important than their lives, Saad!

1058
01:11:00,867 --> 01:11:02,175
That's disgusting!

1059
01:11:02,234 --> 01:11:04,874
And to top it all,
I can't get that idiot out of my head.

1060
01:11:05,234 --> 01:11:06,941
Can you believe it,
in the middle all this...

1061
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,570
...I'm still worried
about my relationship?

1062
01:11:09,234 --> 01:11:12,215
I hate myself, Saad!
I don't know what to do.

1063
01:11:12,234 --> 01:11:14,475
Nothing! Don't do anything.

1064
01:11:14,534 --> 01:11:16,207
You know what...
'Karva-chauth' is due soon.

1065
01:11:16,234 --> 01:11:18,111
Why don't you fast for him?

1066
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:21,176
And I thought you were upset
because he stole your story.

1067
01:11:24,134 --> 01:11:25,511
Is that why you called me here?

1068
01:11:27,467 --> 01:11:29,140
Sometimes...when you look
at your problems from a distance...

1069
01:11:29,234 --> 01:11:30,474
...you get a different perspective.

1070
01:11:31,234 --> 01:11:32,372
That's why I brought you here.

1071
01:11:34,267 --> 01:11:37,180
Noor, everyone makes mistakes...
but judging yourself...

1072
01:11:37,534 --> 01:11:38,512
It's a vicious circle.

1073
01:11:39,467 --> 01:11:42,073
Okay, come. This bar is closed.
- No!

1074
01:11:42,167 --> 01:11:43,168
Yes!

1075
01:11:45,034 --> 01:11:46,342
Get dressed, we're going out.

1076
01:12:03,534 --> 01:12:04,535
Two pints, please.

1077
01:12:09,967 --> 01:12:11,037
Thank you.

1078
01:12:11,267 --> 01:12:12,211
Here you go.

1079
01:12:17,334 --> 01:12:19,280
No-no-no...
- What is That, Saad?

1080
01:12:19,534 --> 01:12:21,036
To 'no more fighting'!

1081
01:12:22,234 --> 01:12:24,236
To 'no more fighting'!
- Cheers.

1082
01:12:59,300 --> 01:13:00,210
Listen...

1083
01:13:04,134 --> 01:13:05,272
There's something I want to tell you.

1084
01:13:09,367 --> 01:13:10,937
I've been thinking of
telling you this for a while...

1085
01:13:11,034 --> 01:13:15,141
...but I'm scared of your reaction...

1086
01:13:16,234 --> 01:13:17,212
Should I say it?

1087
01:13:21,067 --> 01:13:24,071
You know, I never thought
even I could be nervous like this.

1088
01:13:29,234 --> 01:13:30,235
Come here.

1089
01:13:36,234 --> 01:13:39,238
I left my wallet...at home.

1090
01:14:21,501 --> 01:14:24,277
Why did you do that, Saad?
- what?

1091
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:27,844
Why did you lie to me?

1092
01:14:28,167 --> 01:14:30,579
Your wallefs in your pocket, isn't it?

1093
01:14:30,967 --> 01:14:33,208
I just wanted to see
that look on your face.

1094
01:14:34,134 --> 01:14:37,240
What look?
- You know the classic 'Noor' look.

1095
01:14:38,234 --> 01:14:42,239
Seriously, you should've
seen your face...it was amazing.

1096
01:16:15,334 --> 01:16:17,075
Alright.

1097
01:16:20,334 --> 01:16:21,836
Not bad.

1098
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:24,908
Hey, you found it.
Just give me a minute.

1099
01:16:25,234 --> 01:16:27,578
It's bland, Raphael.
Definitely needs something.

1100
01:16:27,900 --> 01:16:30,073
Green chilli perhaps,
to improve the flavor.

1101
01:16:30,167 --> 01:16:32,443
Okay, green chilli and lemon.
Can you star-t working on that?

1102
01:16:41,234 --> 01:16:43,180
Your world is so beautiful, Saad.

1103
01:16:46,534 --> 01:16:47,911
Come.

1104
01:16:49,067 --> 01:16:52,480
You've achieved so much, on your own.

1105
01:16:53,067 --> 01:16:56,207
You know, after coming
here I feel...l never knew you.

1106
01:16:57,434 --> 01:17:00,540
You're a self-made man, Saad.
That's pretty cool.

1107
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:05,982
Why do you leave this beautiful world
and come to Mumbai so often, Saad?

1108
01:17:09,967 --> 01:17:11,002
Because of you.

1109
01:17:16,234 --> 01:17:19,238
Morning.
- Morning.

1110
01:17:19,900 --> 01:17:21,311
Hey...
Come here-Come here

1111
01:17:22,367 --> 01:17:23,937
Come here...
- Where?

1112
01:17:24,167 --> 01:17:25,874
Come.
- Saad.

1113
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:27,978
Look.

1114
01:17:29,901 --> 01:17:36,011
What? It's a tree.
- It's a tree? That's all you see.

1115
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:37,235
Just look at it.

1116
01:17:38,167 --> 01:17:39,441
You know, people like us...

1117
01:17:39,501 --> 01:17:41,503
...will stand under its shade
for a while and then leave.

1118
01:17:42,134 --> 01:17:45,377
But this tree...it's been here before
us, and it will be here even after us.

1119
01:17:48,034 --> 01:17:51,208
We're so small...and our
problems are even smaller.

1120
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:58,508
So...if there's one thing
I've learnt in life, then that is...

1121
01:18:00,134 --> 01:18:01,204
Live for today...

1122
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:10,110
Hi, Dad.

1123
01:18:12,534 --> 01:18:14,912
I am fine, any news about Malti.

1124
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:25,348
Yes, Dad. I am coming back.

1125
01:18:30,167 --> 01:18:31,202
So what happened?

1126
01:18:33,234 --> 01:18:38,149
Vilas is dead.

1127
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:41,276
It's my fault. How long will I keep running
from my responsibilities?

1128
01:19:08,534 --> 01:19:12,004
They recovered the body...
from the garbage dump.

1129
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:17,843
Noor!

1130
01:19:27,100 --> 01:19:30,343
Noor...it's okay, dear...it's okay...

1131
01:19:42,234 --> 01:19:43,144
Noor!

1132
01:19:45,234 --> 01:19:46,110
Noor!

1133
01:19:55,067 --> 01:19:55,909
Noor!

1134
01:19:57,234 --> 01:19:58,212
Noor!

1135
01:20:01,300 --> 01:20:03,507
Open the door.
- Why?

1136
01:20:03,901 --> 01:20:05,346
Just open it.

1137
01:20:12,167 --> 01:20:13,510
Dad, please get out of the car.

1138
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:09,538
<i>Mam!</i>

1139
01:21:10,434 --> 01:21:12,436
Malti, please open the door.

1140
01:21:12,801 --> 01:21:16,010
I am going to sit out here
until you open the door!

1141
01:21:16,167 --> 01:21:21,014
You can't stay here alone, Malti.
Please come home with me.

1142
01:21:30,867 --> 01:21:31,868
<i>Mam!</i>

1143
01:21:32,467 --> 01:21:33,878
Open the door, dear.

1144
01:21:38,367 --> 01:21:39,368
<i>Mam!</i>

1145
01:22:27,434 --> 01:22:28,504
<i>Mam ...</i>

1146
01:22:32,334 --> 01:22:34,439
It's all my fault.

1147
01:22:35,900 --> 01:22:39,279
If I hadn't given that interview,
my brother would still be alive!

1148
01:22:43,967 --> 01:22:46,470
My brother's body was
Found on a garbage heap.

1149
01:22:50,501 --> 01:22:52,913
They abducted me too.

1150
01:23:00,534 --> 01:23:03,310
You called me your big sister,
didn't you?

1151
01:23:12,534 --> 01:23:15,276
We're insects to you, aren't we?

1152
01:23:16,867 --> 01:23:19,575
You can step on us and move ahead.

1153
01:23:23,367 --> 01:23:25,574
<i>Mam ...</i>

1154
01:23:43,334 --> 01:23:45,575
So that's it.

1155
01:23:47,534 --> 01:23:48,945
No, it's not!

1156
01:23:53,500 --> 01:23:56,504
My brother's body was
found in the dumpster.

1157
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:59,804
You called me your Elder sister,
didn't you?

1158
01:24:02,367 --> 01:24:05,837
We're insects to you, aren't we?

1159
01:24:06,901 --> 01:24:10,371
Shinde promised to give me a job.'

1160
01:24:10,534 --> 01:24:12,536
He said he'll give me a job.'

1161
01:24:13,434 --> 01:24:17,348
But...he stole my kidney.'

1162
01:24:40,534 --> 01:24:41,979
Do you know him?

1163
01:24:46,534 --> 01:24:48,013
Do you know him?

1164
01:24:50,001 --> 01:24:51,810
Do you know this doctor?

1165
01:25:10,334 --> 01:25:11,972
Do you know him?

1166
01:25:13,201 --> 01:25:15,511
Listen...please tell me.

1167
01:25:23,234 --> 01:25:24,212
Speak...

1168
01:25:29,534 --> 01:25:31,036
Dr. Shinde...

1169
01:25:31,201 --> 01:25:32,544
Please roll sound, Nasar bhai é€“ Okay, ma'am.

1170
01:25:40,167 --> 01:25:42,408
Are the Kapadias involved
in organ harvesting?

1171
01:25:45,534 --> 01:25:48,344
No.

1172
01:25:48,401 --> 01:25:50,472
After days of investigation, we now know that there
are many other victims like Vilas Tambe...'

1173
01:25:50,534 --> 01:25:52,536
...who fell prey to the organ harvesting scam.'

1174
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:56,243
And the person responsible
behind the scam was Dr. Dilip Shinde.'

1175
01:25:56,500 --> 01:25:59,071
He used the Kapadia Trust as a front...

1176
01:25:59,967 --> 01:26:03,278
...and in the process,
Dr. Dilip Shinde walked free.

1177
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:08,004
The Mankhurd SRA Colony
is a playground for Dr. Shinde.'

1178
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:10,370
9300 homes...'

1179
01:26:10,801 --> 01:26:12,144
45,000 people.'

1180
01:26:12,534 --> 01:26:14,571
And one of them was Vilas Tambe.'

1181
01:26:16,434 --> 01:26:18,937
Malti, Vilas Tambe's sister...'

1182
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:22,538
...who mustered the courage
to speak in front of the camera.'

1183
01:26:23,234 --> 01:26:25,180
And in return, she lost her brother.'

1184
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:31,071
The real heroes, are not...'

1185
01:26:35,500 --> 01:26:38,811
The real heroes, are not the ones,
who ask questions behind the camera.'

1186
01:26:39,300 --> 01:26:41,837
The real heroes are the
ones who face the camera...

1187
01:26:41,900 --> 01:26:43,902
...and dare to speak the truth.'

1188
01:26:45,167 --> 01:26:48,307
So tell me...
who is Vilas Tambe's murderer.'

1189
01:26:49,034 --> 01:26:52,345
Is it Dr. Shinde? Is it the media?'

1190
01:26:54,867 --> 01:26:56,346
Or is it you, Mumbai?'

1191
01:26:57,534 --> 01:26:59,013
It is you, Mumbai.'

1192
01:26:59,901 --> 01:27:03,371
I used to dance for hours
at Marine Drive in the rain.

1193
01:27:04,534 --> 01:27:06,946
Now, I think twice before
stepping out of my home.

1194
01:27:08,067 --> 01:27:11,310
What if thousands of prying eyes
pierce through my drenched clothes?

1195
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,480
Mumbai...You make me feel undressed.

1196
01:27:16,034 --> 01:27:17,945
There's a traffic signal
right next to my home...

1197
01:27:18,534 --> 01:27:21,538
...where two young girls have been selling
flowers for the last seven years.

1198
01:27:22,267 --> 01:27:24,474
Please take one, Sir...
it'll make your girlfriend happy.

1199
01:27:24,534 --> 01:27:27,014
Please take one,
Sir...it'll make your boss happy.

1200
01:27:28,267 --> 01:27:29,940
I am not happy, Mumbai.

1201
01:27:30,900 --> 01:27:32,243
Because every Monday
two of your daughters...

1202
01:27:32,334 --> 01:27:35,804
...are on the streets at 10:30,
and not in school.

1203
01:27:36,834 --> 01:27:38,313
And your slums, Mumbai...

1204
01:27:39,167 --> 01:27:40,510
I've been deep inside.

1205
01:27:41,534 --> 01:27:43,912
Their pockets are empty,
but people are happy.

1206
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:49,374
But this happiness gets devoured
by some greedy builder...like that!

1207
01:27:51,167 --> 01:27:53,511
Bustling homes are
razed to the ground.

1208
01:27:53,934 --> 01:27:56,175
People are tossed around.

1209
01:27:57,434 --> 01:27:59,175
The only thing these people
get in the name of rehabilitation...

1210
01:27:59,234 --> 01:28:00,508
...are concentration camps.

1211
01:28:01,467 --> 01:28:03,469
But these are your
lucky citizens, Mumbai.

1212
01:28:04,034 --> 01:28:08,278
What about those...who went near the
railway tracks to relieve themselves...

1213
01:28:09,167 --> 01:28:10,510
...and lost a limb.

1214
01:28:11,567 --> 01:28:15,242
People are losing arms and
limbs because you don't have bathrooms.

1215
01:28:16,567 --> 01:28:18,843
I stopped smoking, Mumbai.

1216
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:22,508
Because your air already
fills my lungs with crap.

1217
01:28:23,267 --> 01:28:24,075
It's poison.

1218
01:28:24,801 --> 01:28:27,441
And your water, its piss.

1219
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:29,870
And taxes...

1220
01:28:30,367 --> 01:28:32,176
Holy shit

1221
01:28:32,534 --> 01:28:34,275
I go out on an arm and
limb to fill your pockets...

1222
01:28:34,367 --> 01:28:36,347
...and what do I get in return?

1223
01:28:37,401 --> 01:28:42,009
Clogged drains, open sewers,
shit roads, polluted sea...

1224
01:28:42,367 --> 01:28:45,541
A struggling police force
that gets paid pittance.

1225
01:28:48,567 --> 01:28:52,037
26/11...26/7...7/11...

1226
01:28:52,534 --> 01:28:53,877
You were bombed...

1227
01:28:54,300 --> 01:28:55,802
...the floods washed you away...

1228
01:28:56,534 --> 01:29:01,176
...yet, you came backmwith
that 'All ls Well' smile of yours.

1229
01:29:01,501 --> 01:29:07,042
Is your gut and anger both dead?

1230
01:29:08,234 --> 01:29:09,508
Don't take a deep breath, Mumbai.

1231
01:29:10,034 --> 01:29:11,206
Don't count till 10.

1232
01:29:12,267 --> 01:29:13,905
Don't calm down...

1233
01:29:16,300 --> 01:29:18,302
That Tsunami, which came till Chennai.

1234
01:29:18,534 --> 01:29:19,945
I wish it had come
a little further up...

1235
01:29:20,200 --> 01:29:21,304
...that would've been so great.

1236
01:29:23,934 --> 01:29:25,936
Mumbai finished! The End!

1237
01:29:27,234 --> 01:29:29,271
We would've rebuilt you from scratch.

1238
01:29:30,534 --> 01:29:32,172
You would've been reborn again.

1239
01:29:33,334 --> 01:29:34,870
Who are you, Mumbai?

1240
01:29:35,534 --> 01:29:38,572
Do you know...what you've turned into'?

1241
01:29:40,534 --> 01:29:42,036
Rned . <i>I</i> nto a *,.,** _ Qlrl.

1242
01:29:43,367 --> 01:29:45,404
For sale to the highest bidder.

1243
01:29:48,067 --> 01:29:49,910
There's an ancient quote of Buddha.

1244
01:29:51,167 --> 01:29:52,544
The trouble is you
think you've got the time."

1245
01:29:55,167 --> 01:29:56,510
You're time is running out, Mumbai.

1246
01:29:58,334 --> 01:29:59,813
I actually don't care...

1247
01:30:00,367 --> 01:30:02,040
Because you're dying, along with me.

1248
01:30:03,334 --> 01:30:06,315
Beep you Mumbai...Beep the builders...

1249
01:30:06,367 --> 01:30:09,348
...Beep the politicians...
Beep the film-stars and the bureaucrats.

1250
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:11,380
Beep the taxi-drivers
and the Socialites.

1251
01:30:11,434 --> 01:30:13,436
Beep you Mumbai for Beeping me!

1252
01:30:22,367 --> 01:30:24,506
Maybe you and I aren't so
different from each other, Mumbai.

1253
01:30:26,367 --> 01:30:27,539
You're hollow inside.

1254
01:30:31,267 --> 01:30:33,577
You and I, we're both just
passing time for namesake.

1255
01:30:34,301 --> 01:30:35,211
Even I...

1256
01:30:41,200 --> 01:30:43,373
But maybe this is not
how you and I should end up.

1257
01:30:45,067 --> 01:30:47,274
Maybe we should get another chance.

1258
01:30:49,300 --> 01:30:50,802
If nothing else, prove me wrong.

1259
01:30:51,367 --> 01:30:53,074
Show Malti some justice.

1260
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:57,306
Prove...that Vilas'
death won't go in vain.

1261
01:30:59,334 --> 01:31:00,176
Prove it...

1262
01:31:04,334 --> 01:31:05,836
You're killing me, Mumbai.

1263
01:31:15,501 --> 01:31:16,912
Shekhar.

1264
01:31:21,467 --> 01:31:23,174
Hello, Noor.

1265
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,536
What are you doing here?

1266
01:31:31,534 --> 01:31:32,535
Look at me.

1267
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:36,336
You may think that
I am upset with you...

1268
01:31:36,434 --> 01:31:39,438
...because you tried
to malign my family name.

1269
01:31:42,267 --> 01:31:45,009
My family's faced many
such controversies, Noor.

1270
01:31:45,967 --> 01:31:47,275
I am not upset.

1271
01:31:50,067 --> 01:31:51,375
But I am angry.

1272
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:54,980
And it's for your
absolute lack of respect...

1273
01:31:55,034 --> 01:31:57,310
...for the man you learnt everything from.

1274
01:31:58,334 --> 01:32:00,507
You didn't trust him.

1275
01:32:02,434 --> 01:32:03,913
You let him down, Noor.

1276
01:32:14,067 --> 01:32:15,842
This is not my fault, Shekhar.

1277
01:32:17,234 --> 01:32:18,872
And you know that.

1278
01:32:47,467 --> 01:32:48,502
<i>Yeah, Z.
6?.“ Where are you'?</i>

1279
01:32:48,567 --> 01:32:50,137
You need to come here now.

1280
01:33:01,534 --> 01:33:04,572
Go there...and give
him one tight slap.

1281
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:06,838
Really hard.

1282
01:33:15,867 --> 01:33:18,404
Hey...Noor?

1283
01:33:18,534 --> 01:33:20,844
We met the other day,
at Ayaan's show...

1284
01:33:20,901 --> 01:33:22,403
You know, Ayaan right?

1285
01:33:23,234 --> 01:33:24,212
Yeah, we've met.

1286
01:33:25,267 --> 01:33:28,942
You know, Ayaan's taken
the most beautiful pictures of me.

1287
01:33:30,534 --> 01:33:31,535
How nice.

1288
01:33:41,167 --> 01:33:44,376
Look Noor...l know you're upset...

1289
01:33:44,467 --> 01:33:48,005
...but please understand, that my
intentions weren't to upset you.

1290
01:33:49,501 --> 01:33:51,071
These things happen in journalism.

1291
01:33:51,401 --> 01:33:52,505
It happened with me as well.

1292
01:33:52,534 --> 01:33:54,138
Come on...be a sport.

1293
01:33:54,367 --> 01:33:55,505
You'll learn the ropes.

1294
01:33:56,534 --> 01:33:58,571
Everyone has to do it...
to move ahead. .

1295
01:33:59,034 --> 01:34:00,877
Trust me...you'll get over it.

1296
01:34:01,567 --> 01:34:02,910
It's just a story.

1297
01:34:04,334 --> 01:34:05,244
Come on, let's get a drink.

1298
01:34:05,301 --> 01:34:07,042
What are you drinking?
Old Rum. Huh?

1299
01:34:17,401 --> 01:34:18,379
Just an old friend...

1300
01:34:18,434 --> 01:34:20,380
"photographs. let's take some more.

1301
01:34:22,967 --> 01:34:24,037
From Noor...

1302
01:34:27,967 --> 01:34:30,038
MY gosh, are you okay?

1303
01:34:36,234 --> 01:34:40,944
Hey...you went there to slap him...
and he was whispering in your ear.

1304
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:42,877
He was practically kissing you.

1305
01:34:42,934 --> 01:34:44,936
How did that happen?
- Z, don't you get it.

1306
01:34:45,534 --> 01:34:46,877
I am the idiot here.

1307
01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:49,505
This happened because I let it happen.

1308
01:34:50,901 --> 01:34:53,006
Nothing will change if I slap him.

1309
01:35:16,534 --> 01:35:19,572
You were the only
Eagle amongst the Crows.

1310
01:35:20,201 --> 01:35:22,181
What the hell, Shekhar!

1311
01:35:27,534 --> 01:35:29,514
What are you doing here?

1312
01:35:35,334 --> 01:35:38,838
Your piece... brilliant.

1313
01:35:41,034 --> 01:35:42,172
What do you want?

1314
01:35:46,467 --> 01:35:48,276
Your report...

1315
01:35:48,334 --> 01:35:51,281
Mumbai
é€“ You're Killing Me.

1316
01:35:51,900 --> 01:35:53,971
Actually, maybe I'm already dead...

1317
01:35:57,267 --> 01:36:00,544
You know Noor,
every place is the same.

1318
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:02,040
Life's unfair...

1319
01:36:02,201 --> 01:36:03,942
...good people die young.

1320
01:36:04,501 --> 01:36:07,380
Bas**** live longer.

1321
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:09,377
And we journalists...

1322
01:36:09,901 --> 01:36:14,509
We feed on other's lives
to make one for ourselves.

1323
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:17,980
Yeah...so?

1324
01:36:19,267 --> 01:36:21,269
You're going in for the big kill!

1325
01:36:23,934 --> 01:36:25,845
But the question is...

1326
01:36:27,367 --> 01:36:29,313
...have you got it?

1327
01:36:40,567 --> 01:36:42,569
Post or not to post.

1328
01:36:45,501 --> 01:36:47,412
As a social-media specialist...

1329
01:36:47,467 --> 01:36:51,347
...the best time to post something
online is between 3 and 5 pm.

1330
01:36:56,534 --> 01:36:57,911
Here goes.

1331
01:37:07,467 --> 01:37:10,471
The social media video
of Mumbai's Noor Roy Chaudhary...

1332
01:37:10,534 --> 01:37:13,344
...didn't just compel
the common man to think...

1333
01:37:13,401 --> 01:37:14,505
In fact...
- Noor Roy Ohaudharyfls report...

1334
01:37:17,367 --> 01:37:20,541
...has gone completely viral.

1335
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:22,802
Citizen journalist Noor Roy Chaudhary's
post has connected with the people.

1336
01:37:22,867 --> 01:37:26,508
In just a few hours,
we've been getting similar posts...

1337
01:37:26,534 --> 01:37:27,512
...from citizen journalists
from different cities.

1338
01:37:27,567 --> 01:37:29,945
Feels like...

1339
01:37:30,034 --> 01:37:32,446
The real heroes are the ones...

1340
01:37:32,534 --> 01:37:34,411
...who face the camera.

1341
01:37:38,534 --> 01:37:39,842
It's trending all over the country.

1342
01:37:39,901 --> 01:37:42,939
That's why she's getting the support
from students from every part of the country.

1343
01:37:43,800 --> 01:37:45,871
Things are falling apart
how long can we pretend?

1344
01:37:45,967 --> 01:37:48,277
Saying that this is
someone else' problem.

1345
01:37:51,067 --> 01:37:53,570
And you don't feel safe
walking alone in your own city.

1346
01:37:54,401 --> 01:37:56,210
We've roads to drive, but...

1347
01:37:56,267 --> 01:37:58,873
Bustling homes are razed down.

1348
01:37:58,901 --> 01:38:00,505
Someone justice today is...

1349
01:38:00,567 --> 01:38:03,571
What's the point of such progress?

1350
01:38:03,834 --> 01:38:05,871
That kills its own people.

1351
01:38:07,001 --> 01:38:09,880
What is this...

1352
01:38:16,367 --> 01:38:18,278
The one behind this scam...

1353
01:38:20,234 --> 01:38:22,510
No more...it's time we stood up.

1354
01:38:22,534 --> 01:38:25,481
For us...for our family.

1355
01:38:25,534 --> 01:38:27,013
For our country.

1356
01:38:27,434 --> 01:38:30,381
The world's biggest democracy...

1357
01:38:30,534 --> 01:38:32,946
We've been compelled.

1358
01:38:36,967 --> 01:38:38,810
They have no right to live.

1359
01:39:46,500 --> 01:39:49,379
You stalker...
- you celebrity...

1360
01:39:49,534 --> 01:39:51,946
Hold on, what is all this...
please explain.

1361
01:39:52,500 --> 01:39:54,502
1.7 million views!

1362
01:39:54,934 --> 01:39:56,811
2100 shares.

1363
01:39:57,301 --> 01:39:58,336
And just a minute...

1364
01:39:59,234 --> 01:40:02,579
28,310 followers on Twitter.

1365
01:40:02,834 --> 01:40:04,211
You know,
you must practice your autograph...

1366
01:40:04,300 --> 01:40:05,404
...because God just
answered your prayers.

1367
01:40:05,567 --> 01:40:08,377
You have officially become famous.

1368
01:40:08,567 --> 01:40:09,545
You know, God only listens to you...

1369
01:40:09,801 --> 01:40:11,474
...when He wants
to teach you a lesson.

1370
01:40:11,901 --> 01:40:14,472
And dude,
these trolls are after my life.

1371
01:40:14,501 --> 01:40:17,380
Some will troll you...
that's their job.

1372
01:40:18,467 --> 01:40:21,471
But listen,
you star-ted a conversation...

1373
01:40:21,500 --> 01:40:22,843
...one that needs to be had.

1374
01:40:23,567 --> 01:40:25,569
And anyway, you never needed
anyone's approval for anything.

1375
01:40:26,934 --> 01:40:28,538
Well if there's one good thing
that's come from all this...

1376
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:30,473
...it's that Malti's accepted
my friend request.

1377
01:40:32,334 --> 01:40:36,180
You think she'll open the door to me now?

1378
01:40:37,434 --> 01:40:38,504
There's only one way to find out.

1379
01:41:26,367 --> 01:41:27,869
<i>How are you, Mam?</i>

1380
01:41:32,434 --> 01:41:35,176
I saw your video on Facebook.

1381
01:41:37,900 --> 01:41:40,938
Today is Vilas's birthday.

1382
01:41:44,167 --> 01:41:45,976
Today he would've turned 30.

1383
01:41:57,834 --> 01:41:59,211
Malti, no matter how
many times I apologise...

1384
01:41:59,301 --> 01:42:03,044
...for what I did, it isn't enough.

1385
01:42:07,234 --> 01:42:09,145
And what you said the other day...

1386
01:42:11,467 --> 01:42:13,140
Never say it to anyone again.

1387
01:42:16,300 --> 01:42:18,371
Your life is just as valuable,
as mine.

1388
01:43:05,134 --> 01:43:10,174
Sorry...
- No, Didi...

1389
01:43:10,334 --> 01:43:13,178
How's uncle?
- He's fine.

1390
01:43:14,001 --> 01:43:15,446
<i>And Bumpy?</i>

1391
01:43:19,201 --> 01:43:22,580
She keeps scratching
me all day...when I'm working.

1392
01:43:22,834 --> 01:43:25,508
And uncle gets so
furious if I lift her up...

1393
01:43:35,500 --> 01:43:36,501
Sit down everyone.

1394
01:43:38,001 --> 01:43:41,175
And now, the journalist whose story...

1395
01:43:41,267 --> 01:43:43,269
...created quite a
sensation on the internet.

1396
01:43:48,900 --> 01:43:53,906
Today, we have with
us in our studio...Noor Roy Chaudhary.

1397
01:43:53,967 --> 01:43:56,243
Good evening Noor,
and welcome to the show.

1398
01:43:56,334 --> 01:43:57,904
Good evening,
thank you for having me here.

1399
01:43:57,967 --> 01:43:59,446
Mumbai - You're Killing Me!

1400
01:43:59,500 --> 01:44:04,245
Technically speaking your story,
is actually about Vilas Tambe.

1401
01:44:04,334 --> 01:44:08,339
But this story had already broken.

1402
01:44:10,500 --> 01:44:11,501
That story...

1403
01:44:13,467 --> 01:44:16,175
That story was just pointing fingers
at the Kapadia family.

1404
01:44:16,234 --> 01:44:18,373
You know...sensationalist stuff.

1405
01:44:19,401 --> 01:44:20,971
Every ship has rats.

1406
01:44:21,034 --> 01:44:23,810
And I am sure there are some in
Kapadia Family's organization as well.

1407
01:44:24,334 --> 01:44:26,473
That's why they got caught up
in this scandal for no reason.

1408
01:44:27,401 --> 01:44:30,439
I agree that this story
triggered an investigation, but...

1409
01:44:30,501 --> 01:44:32,037
...it had no weight.

1410
01:44:32,501 --> 01:44:34,208
It was very poorly researched.

1411
01:44:34,400 --> 01:44:36,903
And the real culprit, Dr. Dilip Shinde...

1412
01:44:37,500 --> 01:44:39,309
...he came out of all
this without even a scratch.

1413
01:44:40,234 --> 01:44:41,042
He walked free.

1414
01:44:42,500 --> 01:44:44,912
And the victim,
Vilas Tambe...lost his life.

1415
01:44:47,167 --> 01:44:51,343
And I should know this...
because that was my story.

1416
01:44:55,267 --> 01:45:03,209
Are you suggesting that journalist
Ayaan Bannerjee plagiarised your story?

1417
01:45:04,367 --> 01:45:06,847
Apparently 'these things Happen'
in journalism.

1418
01:45:08,534 --> 01:45:10,309
But all I would say is that...

1419
01:45:10,401 --> 01:45:13,382
...without solid facts, much research,
without understanding...

1420
01:45:13,434 --> 01:45:17,280
...the impact on the subjects
when a weak story is released

1421
01:45:17,334 --> 01:45:20,338
...we run the story anyway,
for the sake of TRPs and ratings.

1422
01:45:20,934 --> 01:45:22,242
Every story has a news cycle.

1423
01:45:22,334 --> 01:45:24,541
And as soon as this cycle
comes to an end, the story dies.

1424
01:45:25,934 --> 01:45:28,005
And that's what happened to this story.

1425
01:45:28,367 --> 01:45:31,143
As soon as Ayaan Bannerjee
broke this story on the internet...

1426
01:45:31,200 --> 01:45:34,306
...you, me, and other journalists like us,
picked up this story.

1427
01:45:35,301 --> 01:45:37,941
There were pane I discussions,
hash-tags.

1428
01:45:38,534 --> 01:45:41,481
And somewhere in
the middle of all this...

1429
01:45:41,500 --> 01:45:43,480
...Vilas Tambe was abducted
in a critical condition...

1430
01:45:43,534 --> 01:45:45,514
...and dumped in that
garbage dump...to die.

1431
01:45:47,134 --> 01:45:51,480
No Vilas...No evidence...End of story!

1432
01:45:52,867 --> 01:45:54,540
Then I have to ask you this question.

1433
01:45:55,034 --> 01:46:00,313
If you met Ayaan Bannerjee today...
what would you say to him?

1434
01:46:00,501 --> 01:46:03,380
Actually no... let me rephrase that.

1435
01:46:04,167 --> 01:46:07,512
What would Ayaan Bannerjee say to you?

1436
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:12,108
He would say...

1437
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:20,274
It's Just a Story.

1438
01:46:22,534 --> 01:46:27,244
By the look of things,
this story isn't going to end any time soon.

1439
01:46:27,934 --> 01:46:31,313
Such a pleasure to have
you on my show, Noor.

1440
01:46:31,534 --> 01:46:34,105
We're eagerly awaiting
your next story.

1441
01:47:03,201 --> 01:47:04,373
That was so good.

1442
01:47:10,401 --> 01:47:12,472
Often those who appear strong...

1443
01:47:12,501 --> 01:47:14,481
...are weak on the inside.

1444
01:47:15,167 --> 01:47:18,478
It was sad that
Ayaan had lost his humanity...

1445
01:47:18,534 --> 01:47:20,275
...because of his life experiences.

1446
01:47:20,500 --> 01:47:22,878
It seemed that he couldn't feel for others.

1447
01:47:23,400 --> 01:47:25,277
Somewhere I felt pity for him.

1448
01:47:25,534 --> 01:47:27,571
After all,
he was fighting a battle as well.

1449
01:47:28,001 --> 01:47:29,412
With himself.

1450
01:47:29,834 --> 01:47:33,338
Does climbing the ladder
of success mean everything?

1451
01:47:33,968 --> 01:47:37,381
What's the point of success
If it separates <i>us</i> from our kin.

1452
01:47:38,134 --> 01:47:39,841
When you take them with you...

1453
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:41,479
...then it'll be much more fun.

1454
01:47:43,167 --> 01:47:46,478
Malti and all the people who fell prey
to Dr. Shinde's scam...

1455
01:47:46,900 --> 01:47:49,005
"they all dared to testify.

1456
01:47:50,001 --> 01:47:51,241
And as they say...

1457
01:47:51,500 --> 01:47:53,207
Truth never Loses.

1458
01:48:06,334 --> 01:48:07,472
I don't hate my life.

1459
01:48:08,467 --> 01:48:10,344
In fact, I love my life.

1460
01:48:13,300 --> 01:48:14,870
I love everything about it.

1461
01:48:15,434 --> 01:48:16,845
Except, my weight...

1462
01:48:17,500 --> 01:48:20,140
...which is still same to same.

1463
01:48:24,567 --> 01:48:25,477
<i>Bye, Mam .</i>

1464
01:48:25,800 --> 01:48:28,144
Bye, Dad. - See you...
- Bye, good luck.

1465
01:48:28,534 --> 01:48:31,845
Uncle, would you like some tea?
- Absolutely, I do.

1466
01:48:31,934 --> 01:48:32,810
Yeah...

1467
01:48:42,167 --> 01:48:43,043
You were great.

1468
01:48:47,134 --> 01:48:48,044
Thanks to you.

1469
01:48:49,500 --> 01:48:52,572
Off somewhere?
- Yeah...I've an interview at CNBC.

1470
01:48:52,834 --> 01:48:54,472
For the job of senior correspondent.

1471
01:48:54,800 --> 01:48:56,177
And?
- And I'm late!

1472
01:48:56,800 --> 01:48:58,143
Some things never change.

1473
01:49:00,801 --> 01:49:03,543
Noor, you proved
that not just the city...

1474
01:49:03,901 --> 01:49:05,107
...but 'News' is changing as well.

1475
01:49:05,534 --> 01:49:09,175
And you're falling in
that old-age news trap again.

1476
01:49:10,967 --> 01:49:12,275
What happened to that Eagle?

1477
01:49:13,400 --> 01:49:14,470
And what is this?

1478
01:49:15,534 --> 01:49:17,411
You worked so hard to find yourself.

1479
01:49:18,467 --> 01:49:19,377
...and then lost yourself again?

1480
01:49:27,434 --> 01:49:31,507
How do people wear these clothes every day?
I feel suffocated in this skin.

1481
01:49:41,334 --> 01:49:44,440
I've an offer for you.
- what?

1482
01:49:44,501 --> 01:49:45,571
Come on.
- Where?

1483
01:49:45,867 --> 01:49:46,572
Come on...

1484
01:49:47,367 --> 01:49:49,244
Now I am really going to be late.

1485
01:49:49,800 --> 01:49:51,370
Where are you taking me, Shekhar?

1486
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,276
So? How is it?

1487
01:50:19,467 --> 01:50:20,810
Pukexzom...

1488
01:50:21,167 --> 01:50:22,339
It's pathetic.

1489
01:50:22,501 --> 01:50:24,276
This pathetic room is now all yours.

1490
01:50:24,334 --> 01:50:26,905
Huh'?
- your office...to be precise.

1491
01:50:27,501 --> 01:50:28,912
I've paid full year's rent...

1492
01:50:29,367 --> 01:50:30,368
You're the boss.

1493
01:50:30,534 --> 01:50:34,448
Hire anyone you like...
do the stories you've always wanted to.

1494
01:50:35,567 --> 01:50:36,807
Does Lavina know?

1495
01:50:39,001 --> 01:50:40,002
It was her idea.

1496
01:50:42,968 --> 01:50:45,505
You remind me of the person I once was.

1497
01:50:45,867 --> 01:50:49,246
Shekhar is still a...
- Jerk... Joker.

1498
01:50:52,334 --> 01:50:55,577
I was going to say journalist,
but... Okay.

1499
01:51:00,500 --> 01:51:02,275
Mumbai isn't 'killing' you, Noor...

1500
01:51:03,167 --> 01:51:05,010
It's making you stronger.

1501
01:51:16,034 --> 01:51:17,536
How are you feeling?
- Good.

1502
01:51:19,367 --> 01:51:20,437
Grateful.

1503
01:51:21,801 --> 01:51:25,442
And...what about men?
- What About men?

1504
01:51:29,234 --> 01:51:31,339
You know, Noor...l was thinking...

1505
01:51:32,334 --> 01:51:35,440
Suppose...if a guy like me...

1506
01:51:36,134 --> 01:51:43,143
...proposes to a girl like you...
then what would be her answer.

1507
01:51:43,867 --> 01:51:49,317
A 'guy' like you...proposes to a 'girl' like me...
- Yeah

1508
01:51:49,401 --> 01:51:53,247
...then what will I say?
- Not you...someone like 'you'.

1509
01:51:55,134 --> 01:51:56,477
Let me think.

1510
01:51:59,400 --> 01:52:01,471
So what you're saying
is if a guy like you...

1511
01:52:01,534 --> 01:52:03,571
...proposes to a girl like me,
then what will I...

1512
01:52:03,867 --> 01:52:06,939
I mean...what will she say?
- What will She say?

1513
01:52:07,801 --> 01:52:09,803
I'll say we should
live together first...

1514
01:52:09,867 --> 01:52:12,177
Wait, are you saying this...
or the 'girl' like you?

1515
01:52:12,467 --> 01:52:13,275
To be clear.

1516
01:52:13,334 --> 01:52:16,804
Saad...you're being
extra-ordinarily annoying today.

1517
01:52:20,501 --> 01:52:22,037
Are you proposing to me?

1518
01:52:23,934 --> 01:52:27,347
Saad...are you proposing to me?

1519
01:52:28,900 --> 01:52:31,972
You're just hitting on me...
just want to get into my pants.

1520
01:52:32,134 --> 01:52:35,013
I am not hitting on you...
and your pants won't fit me.

1521
01:52:35,134 --> 01:52:37,876
Won't fit you! Won't fit you, huh!

1522
01:52:41,034 --> 01:52:43,514
But tell me...what would you have said?

1523
01:52:44,334 --> 01:52:46,007
Are we really going
back on this merry go-round.

1524
01:52:46,134 --> 01:52:47,374
Are you dizzy?

1525
01:52:47,501 --> 01:52:48,343
But it's okay..

1526
01:52:48,500 --> 01:52:50,207
Whenever girls are with me,
they do feel dizzy.

1527
01:52:50,901 --> 01:52:52,938
I would've said yes...
- what?

1528
01:52:53,267 --> 01:52:58,876
Yes...l would've said yes, but...
it's not me, it's someone like me.

1529
01:53:01,034 --> 01:53:05,574
Yes, but you would've said yes.
- Yes...but you're not asking.

1530
01:53:05,834 --> 01:53:09,976
That's true, but...would you?

1531
01:53:10,834 --> 01:53:12,279
Are you asking?

1532
01:53:12,834 --> 01:53:15,212
Me? Am I asking?

1533
01:53:16,134 --> 01:53:17,374
Not someone like me?

1534
01:53:17,467 --> 01:53:20,471
Saad...can we end this conversation
before one of us dies?

1535
01:53:26,900 --> 01:53:29,346
So you said yes...
- Shut up, Saad!

1536
01:53:33,234 --> 01:53:34,212
Yeah...

1537
01:53:38,334 --> 01:53:40,905
Move your hips baby...
Move your hips baby...

1538
01:53:40,967 --> 01:53:43,208
From night till dawn, baby.

1539
01:53:43,267 --> 01:53:45,474
Move your hips baby...
Move your hips baby...

1540
01:53:45,534 --> 01:53:48,071
From night till dawn, baby.

1541
01:53:48,134 --> 01:53:50,307
Move your hips baby...
Move your hips baby...

1542
01:53:50,400 --> 01:53:52,937
From night till dawn, baby.

1543
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,207
Move your hips baby...
Move your hips baby...

1544
01:53:55,267 --> 01:53:57,269
From night till dawn, baby.

1545
01:53:57,334 --> 01:53:59,371
When you shake those hips...

1546
01:53:59,434 --> 01:54:02,040
mmy hear-t star-ts to sway.

1547
01:54:02,101 --> 01:54:04,342
When I shake those hips...

1548
01:54:04,400 --> 01:54:07,142
myour hear-t star-ts to sway.

1549
01:54:07,201 --> 01:54:09,875
Your beauty makes me blind.
If you don't mind...

1550
01:54:09,934 --> 01:54:12,073
Can I come close to you and grind?

1551
01:54:12,134 --> 01:54:16,480
What do you get? What do you
get by torturing us?

1552
01:54:17,200 --> 01:54:21,307
All of you, I find you to be fit.

1553
01:54:21,367 --> 01:54:26,146
When you dance in a disco,
you look lit.

1554
01:54:26,200 --> 01:54:30,945
Like hard liquor,
you hit.

1555
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,537
You do!

1556
01:54:33,801 --> 01:54:36,042
From night till dawn, baby.

1557
01:54:36,100 --> 01:54:38,307
Move your hips baby...
Move your hips baby...

1558
01:54:38,367 --> 01:54:40,870
From night till dawn, baby.

1559
01:54:40,934 --> 01:54:43,210
Move my hips baby...
Move my hips baby...

1560
01:54:43,267 --> 01:54:45,474
From night till dawn, baby.

1561
01:54:54,534 --> 01:54:57,105
Your hips sway like pendulum.

1562
01:54:57,167 --> 01:54:59,374
Baby, how are we going to handle them.

1563
01:54:59,434 --> 01:55:04,076
I swear...
you've made my hear-t go crazy.

1564
01:55:04,134 --> 01:55:06,978
Baby, don't play
With hearts of the boys.

1565
01:55:07,034 --> 01:55:09,241
Don't talk like that.

1566
01:55:09,267 --> 01:55:12,305
There are many girls here...

1567
01:55:12,334 --> 01:55:14,143
...but you slay.

1568
01:55:14,201 --> 01:55:16,408
You're sweet and sour like ginger ale.

1569
01:55:16,468 --> 01:55:18,971
I've never seen a female like you.

1570
01:55:19,034 --> 01:55:21,412
Your figure's to die for...

1571
01:55:21,467 --> 01:55:23,538
You're hotter than Delhi's summer.

1572
01:55:23,800 --> 01:55:28,249
You are busy on Snapchat
with your girlfriends.

1573
01:55:28,467 --> 01:55:33,382
I am busy on Snapchat
with my girlfriends.

1574
01:55:33,434 --> 01:55:36,244
I swear, the way your hips flow...

1575
01:55:36,300 --> 01:55:38,837
Baby, boys' mind will be blown.

1576
01:55:38,901 --> 01:55:43,008
Take a breather.
Listen to me.

1577
01:55:43,067 --> 01:55:47,538
When I look at you, I get a kick.

1578
01:55:47,800 --> 01:55:52,408
The dress you wear, I find it sick.

1579
01:55:52,467 --> 01:55:57,177
You look one in a million, chick.

1580
01:55:57,234 --> 01:56:00,078
You do!

1581
01:56:00,134 --> 01:56:02,375
You ruined everyone, baby.

1582
01:56:02,434 --> 01:56:04,914
Move your hips baby...
Move your hips baby...

1583
01:56:04,967 --> 01:56:07,106
From night till dawn, baby.

1584
01:56:07,167 --> 01:56:09,477
Move my hips baby...
Move my hips baby...

1585
01:56:09,534 --> 01:56:12,037
From night till dawn, baby.

1586
01:56:12,100 --> 01:56:14,341
Move your hips baby...
Move your hips baby...

1587
01:56:14,401 --> 01:56:16,847
From night till dawn, baby.

1588
01:56:16,901 --> 01:56:19,472
Move my hips baby...
Move my hips baby...

1589
01:56:19,534 --> 01:56:22,447
Badshaah...

1590
01:56:23,401 --> 01:56:26,871
Back off! Back off, I tell you!

1591
01:56:31,001 --> 01:56:33,242
You don't back off, do you?
