1
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,604
'Theni District'

2
00:02:14,646 --> 00:02:16,395
'Due to air pollution'

3
00:02:16,437 --> 00:02:19,395
Maharashtra Govt has banned
the operations of Sanjay Industries

4
00:02:19,437 --> 00:02:23,020
'The case filed by the public against
this firm operating in Maruthamangalam...'

5
00:02:23,062 --> 00:02:25,354
...has already met with 2 adjournments

6
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:29,312
With regard to this, the opposition has
not submitted any supporting documents

7
00:02:29,354 --> 00:02:32,229
- Objection, Your Honor
- Objection overruled

8
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,395
It is the court's duty to allay
the fears of the general public

9
00:02:39,437 --> 00:02:41,228
This is my humble request

10
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:43,895
Begin your argument, Mr Shanmugam

11
00:02:43,937 --> 00:02:46,811
Ignorance of the general public
about Sanjay Copper Industries

12
00:02:46,853 --> 00:02:48,395
...is the reason for this fear

13
00:02:48,437 --> 00:02:52,145
In the preparation of copper
we are introducing many reforms

14
00:02:52,181 --> 00:02:55,811
We need extension of time to submit
supporting documents regarding this

15
00:02:55,853 --> 00:02:57,095
'That's all, Your Honor'

16
00:02:57,235 --> 00:02:59,770
After hearing the arguments
of both the sides

17
00:02:59,811 --> 00:03:02,779
'...as much as industrial growth
is important to the welfare of society'

18
00:03:02,804 --> 00:03:06,354
...we must bear in mind
people's security is more important

19
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:08,604
'Therefore Sanjay Industries'

20
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:12,062
...has to submit its justification in court

21
00:03:12,103 --> 00:03:16,937
Until then this court notifies
interim injunction will continue

22
00:03:19,648 --> 00:03:21,190
'Glad about stay continuing'

23
00:03:21,222 --> 00:03:23,889
No big deal but make sure
you come for the next hearing, okay?

24
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:26,389
- I'll take care, you carry on
- Take photocopies

25
00:03:26,421 --> 00:03:27,421
'Hey...!'

26
00:03:28,001 --> 00:03:29,071
Come here

27
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:35,228
- Yes, comrade
- Are you all jobless?

28
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:37,687
Is your job just roaming around
court and filing cases?

29
00:03:37,728 --> 00:03:40,187
If you can carry on atrocities
hailing from another town...

30
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:42,020
...can't we fight for our own land?

31
00:03:42,062 --> 00:03:44,948
Stop it right here
Only then you're on safe ground

32
00:03:45,004 --> 00:03:47,630
Otherwise I'll chop you to pieces

33
00:03:47,664 --> 00:03:49,565
Comrade, if you hack us
one more will emerge!

34
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:52,312
- If even he's killed, same story
- How many of us will you kill?

35
00:03:52,354 --> 00:03:54,937
Seeds have already been sown
They will sprout and spring up

36
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,043
Anyone who opposed us
has never lived you know

37
00:03:57,077 --> 00:03:58,807
Hey! Not lived, huh?

38
00:03:59,145 --> 00:04:01,937
In this world, someone or the other
will be born to oppose someone

39
00:04:01,969 --> 00:04:03,291
You don't decide who lives

40
00:04:03,322 --> 00:04:04,335
Leave that to God!

41
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:05,646
Do what you can

42
00:04:05,687 --> 00:04:07,268
Come on, boys

43
00:04:07,562 --> 00:04:10,562
- Relax, comrade
- Get going...go

44
00:04:10,811 --> 00:04:13,042
Sir, we are in court
We will see them later

45
00:04:13,078 --> 00:04:15,204
'Why get into a fight
with him unnecessarily?'

46
00:04:28,229 --> 00:04:29,895
'Chennai'

47
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,995
'Hey, trust me, I'm telling you-'

48
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,583
- Hello, bro
- 'Flirting, huh?'

49
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,150
'Nothing of that sort, bro'

50
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,807
- 'Hey...!'
- Vanakkam, bro

51
00:04:37,846 --> 00:04:39,895
'Air is filled with jasmine scent, eh?'

52
00:04:39,937 --> 00:04:41,604
Rainbow colors, huh?

53
00:04:43,562 --> 00:04:46,437
Saro, you had zero demand in the market

54
00:04:46,562 --> 00:04:48,895
But now you seem to be most wanted!

55
00:04:48,937 --> 00:04:50,604
You are the one
who has forgotten me!

56
00:04:50,646 --> 00:04:53,978
Shucks! I don't eat
old food nowadays

57
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,270
[whistles in appreciation]

58
00:04:56,604 --> 00:04:57,811
- Hey...!
- Bro

59
00:04:58,145 --> 00:05:00,479
- Who is this new chick?
- 'Don't know, bro'

60
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,909
Sir, I have an exam tomorrow morning

61
00:05:02,948 --> 00:05:04,895
I came here only to take my exam

62
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:08,312
They brought me here even though
I tried my best to explain, sir

63
00:05:08,354 --> 00:05:10,604
You brought a student here?
Are you brainless or what?

64
00:05:10,646 --> 00:05:11,895
Bro, we didn't know-

65
00:05:12,905 --> 00:05:15,447
- What is your name?
- Bhagyalakshmi, sir

66
00:05:15,895 --> 00:05:16,978
Bhagyalakshmi?

67
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,770
I was just teasing these fellows

68
00:05:19,145 --> 00:05:20,354
You don't worry

69
00:05:20,395 --> 00:05:22,895
Wait upstairs for a while
You can leave early, okay?

70
00:05:22,937 --> 00:05:25,409
- Hey! Take her upstairs
- 'Okay, bro'

71
00:05:25,447 --> 00:05:27,034
Trust me and go up
Don't cry, dear

72
00:05:27,064 --> 00:05:28,072
'Thanks, sir'

73
00:05:28,108 --> 00:05:30,315
Chase these hookers away

74
00:05:31,129 --> 00:05:33,087
Bro, what about that girl upstairs?

75
00:05:33,395 --> 00:05:35,395
- What was her name?
- Bhagyalakshmi

76
00:05:35,437 --> 00:05:37,062
Means the blessed one, eh?

77
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:40,143
Let me run up and check
how fortunate she is!

78
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,895
Bhagyalakshmi...oho...!!

79
00:05:42,937 --> 00:05:46,020
'Without realizing, I gave it to
the wrong hands and I'm in a mess now'

80
00:05:46,062 --> 00:05:47,221
Cheers!

81
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:50,020
Raghu, please return all the costumes

82
00:05:50,046 --> 00:05:51,463
I rented it 3 days ago

83
00:05:51,503 --> 00:05:54,315
These costumes are needed for
shooting tomorrow, please give them

84
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:57,020
You go now, our boys will
return them tomorrow in the shop

85
00:05:57,062 --> 00:05:59,895
2 chaps are standing out here
and torturing me for these uniforms

86
00:05:59,937 --> 00:06:00,963
Please return them

87
00:06:01,008 --> 00:06:02,509
- Check them out
- Yes, bro

88
00:06:41,395 --> 00:06:42,562
Who are you?

89
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:44,145
'What do you want?'

90
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,770
You're asking me so decently

91
00:06:45,811 --> 00:06:47,853
But he knocked my adam's apple out

92
00:06:47,895 --> 00:06:49,604
You know how painful that can be!

93
00:06:49,646 --> 00:06:50,770
How painful?

94
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:52,062
Hey, come here

95
00:06:52,895 --> 00:06:54,035
I tapped gently

96
00:06:54,082 --> 00:06:56,667
- But he used force, sir
- What's so important about the shoot?

97
00:06:56,687 --> 00:06:58,811
Demanding our costumes
in the middle of the night

98
00:06:58,853 --> 00:07:00,062
Actually, sir-

99
00:07:00,124 --> 00:07:02,105
The day a policeman
dons his khaki uniform

100
00:07:02,145 --> 00:07:04,770
...from that day onwards
he's bound by fairplay and justice

101
00:07:04,811 --> 00:07:07,433
Whoever the criminal may be
he should beat him to a pulp

102
00:07:07,464 --> 00:07:09,604
Tear his shirt to tatters
and drag him to court

103
00:07:09,645 --> 00:07:11,561
One who fights against
bribe and corruption

104
00:07:11,604 --> 00:07:14,145
Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth
be a rowdy to tackle a rowdy

105
00:07:14,187 --> 00:07:16,811
But at the same time
one who is common man's friend

106
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,479
He is a true police officer!

107
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,229
- Am I right?
- Yes, sir

108
00:07:21,229 --> 00:07:22,425
Sir, no...no

109
00:07:22,464 --> 00:07:24,728
That's hero Vikram's dialog
as Commissioner in 'Saamy'

110
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,479
My dialog is your 'yes, sir'

111
00:07:27,062 --> 00:07:29,604
Hoping one day we'll wear
this uniform and speak these words

112
00:07:29,646 --> 00:07:31,187
...we say 'yes, sir' and salute today

113
00:07:31,229 --> 00:07:33,978
Will your sins be forgiven if you
grab even that 'yes, sir' from us?

114
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,395
You intend returning our costume?

115
00:07:35,437 --> 00:07:37,479
I've been saying I can't return
from the beginning

116
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,520
Okay, forget it

117
00:07:38,562 --> 00:07:41,187
- Will Thangam dress store be open?
- Opens at 5:30 a.m

118
00:07:41,229 --> 00:07:42,604
Will you ask them for 2 uniforms?

119
00:07:42,646 --> 00:07:45,187
Forgive us if we troubled you
But this is an important request

120
00:07:45,229 --> 00:07:47,229
Will you take off that uniform
when you drink?

121
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:49,395
It holds a special respect
Okay? Bye then

122
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,437
- Sir, shall we leave?
- Yes, sir

123
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:52,604
You hold your breath well

124
00:07:52,646 --> 00:07:55,229
- You should've sung that SPB song
- I wasn't in films then

125
00:07:59,707 --> 00:08:00,770
What is it, dear?

126
00:08:00,811 --> 00:08:03,770
Why are you so petrified
as if I'm here to rape you, huh?

127
00:08:03,811 --> 00:08:06,395
- It's wrong, sir
- All I want to do is romance with you

128
00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:09,770
- Come on...come on
- I'm not that kind of a girl, sir

129
00:08:09,811 --> 00:08:12,562
Which girl will accept
'I am that kind of a girl'?

130
00:08:12,604 --> 00:08:14,646
'You can use me as you like!'

131
00:08:14,811 --> 00:08:16,604
Stop kidding, darling

132
00:08:16,646 --> 00:08:18,395
- Please don't, sir
- Stop your drama!

133
00:08:18,437 --> 00:08:19,776
Lie down now

134
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,187
I beg you, sir

135
00:08:23,244 --> 00:08:25,910
- Please, sir
- Please 'please' me!

136
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,479
Who is this bear walking into my den?

137
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,687
I'll be back, dear

138
00:08:37,853 --> 00:08:39,479
Hi, glad to meet you

139
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:41,229
Means?

140
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,332
Means I'll punch you till you pass out!

141
00:08:44,062 --> 00:08:45,354
All my boys are downstairs

142
00:08:45,395 --> 00:08:46,520
How did you come up?

143
00:08:46,562 --> 00:08:48,062
Go ask your boys down there

144
00:08:48,085 --> 00:08:49,502
Why ask the one up here?

145
00:11:01,728 --> 00:11:02,811
1 minute, sir

146
00:11:03,687 --> 00:11:05,187
Thank you so much, sir

147
00:11:05,229 --> 00:11:08,187
You shouldn't be silent like this
hoping a savior will come to your aid

148
00:11:08,229 --> 00:11:09,479
Are you a police officer?

149
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:13,020
Whatever costume he wears,
he will live that character

150
00:11:13,229 --> 00:11:16,520
I'm trying to become a comedian
He's trying for a hero's role in films

151
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:18,187
Perfect hero, right?

152
00:11:18,229 --> 00:11:19,853
Sports a 6 pack too!

153
00:11:21,145 --> 00:11:23,395
- Pccht! Forget that
- Okay

154
00:11:23,646 --> 00:11:25,229
As far as I'm concerned
you are a hero

155
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:26,604
One day you'll become a star!

156
00:11:26,646 --> 00:11:28,062
Okay, please bless me

157
00:11:28,103 --> 00:11:29,937
Sir, why are you falling at my feet?

158
00:11:29,978 --> 00:11:31,562
- You meant it, right?
- Yes

159
00:11:31,604 --> 00:11:32,978
From the bottom of your heart?

160
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,354
You said it with love?
Then you are God, bless me

161
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:36,687
- Will I become a hero?
- Sure

162
00:11:36,728 --> 00:11:37,978
If you say so
that's enough

163
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,978
Bro, won't her words come true?

164
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,604
Definitely...definitely

165
00:11:41,895 --> 00:11:43,728
You'll be a hero of the masses

166
00:11:43,853 --> 00:11:45,687
Sing the hero introduction song

167
00:12:06,437 --> 00:12:07,546
He is awesome

168
00:12:07,571 --> 00:12:08,978
Sir, simply superb

169
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,358
Sir, repeat that shake

170
00:12:12,604 --> 00:12:19,270
"Oh my God! Oh my God!!
Sparks will fly in total Tamil Nad"

171
00:12:19,312 --> 00:12:26,395
"Oh my God! Oh my God!!
To our side we know God will nod"

172
00:12:26,437 --> 00:12:33,020
"If we aim with 1 stone and hit
we get 2 mangoes to our benefit"

173
00:12:33,062 --> 00:12:39,395
"Listen to my one liner
'No pain no gain' is the winner"

174
00:12:39,479 --> 00:12:42,948
"Less talk work more you'll shine
'Zero to hero' is your tagline"

175

- What is he doing?
- Practicing for 'Tik Tok' video

227
00:16:22,944 --> 00:16:24,236
Is there money in it?

228
00:16:24,937 --> 00:16:26,978
Hey! Do you call this a job?

229

Akka, give me a 'dosa'

You still want a 'dosa' after the way
my husband insulted you?

243
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,895
Akka, that 'murukku' is stale

244
00:17:04,937 --> 00:17:07,604
He was so concerned for my health
and you're blaming him

245
00:17:07,646 --> 00:17:09,312
So now I am the culprit, huh?

246

...how is it no one is
responsible in this house?

251
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,604
At least 1 person should
be diligent in our family?

252
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:26,671
If we are all spendthrifts,
won't we be penniless?

253
00:17:26,702 --> 00:17:28,993
What are you saying?
How can we afford 'dosa' then?

254
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,604
You have a way with words
Make your own 'dosa'

255

but not this kind of stuff, huh?

00:18:09,187 --> 00:18:10,395

264
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,978
Thanks for your appointment, sir

265
00:18:13,706 --> 00:18:14,995
What can my boss do for you?

266
00:18:15,026 --> 00:18:17,353
My wife wants my son to get married

267
00:18:17,395 --> 00:18:19,062
I spoke to him too

268
00:18:19,103 --> 00:18:21,937
But he told me he has
already decided on the bride

269
00:18:21,978 --> 00:18:24,978
Idiot! What if he brings some fool
and introduces her as his wife?

270
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,373
Then what will happen to our status, sir?

271
00:18:27,447 --> 00:18:29,401
But do you know whose photo he showed?

272
00:18:29,437 --> 00:18:31,145
Your daughter's photo, sir

273
00:18:31,187 --> 00:18:33,187
That's why I came to
discuss this alliance

274
00:18:35,718 --> 00:18:36,801
Appa...?

275
00:18:37,264 --> 00:18:38,306
Hey Rohit!

276
00:18:39,398 --> 00:18:40,768
What is this, sir?

277
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,643

A businessman bred a dog as his pet

280
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,562
He took care of this pet
better than himself

281
00:18:56,604 --> 00:18:59,312
The dog followed him wherever
he went like his faithful shadow

282
00:18:59,353 --> 00:19:00,645
Almost as a family member

283
00:19:00,669 --> 00:19:03,283
One day when he decided to
find a groom for his daughter

284
00:19:03,315 --> 00:19:05,604
...that dog came up to him and asked

285
00:19:05,612 --> 00:19:07,986
'You are looking for
a son-in-law all over the town'

286
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,853
'Why didn't you think of me?'

287
00:19:09,895 --> 00:19:12,770
All said and done
it's just a dog, right?

288
00:19:13,379 --> 00:19:15,129
Do I spare that dog's life?

289
00:19:15,229 --> 00:19:16,395
Or should I kill it?

290
00:19:16,437 --> 00:19:19,229
Don't resort to murder, sir
Please let go of my son

291
00:19:19,437 --> 00:19:24,811
'Set a thief to catch a thief'
is an oft repeated adage

292
00:19:25,479 --> 00:19:27,770
- Do you know that?
- Of course, sir

293
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:33,895
Then I don't have to waste
my breath trying to explain

294
00:19:34,646 --> 00:19:35,728
Get lost!

295
00:19:38,387 --> 00:19:39,720
Where did I stop?

296
00:19:40,103 --> 00:19:41,728
'If it pertains to my business'

297
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:43,770
...I will stoop down to any level

298
00:19:45,437 --> 00:19:47,354
If it has got to do with my status

299
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,520
...I'll go the whole 9 yards!

300
00:19:49,564 --> 00:19:51,730
I've signed on the dotted line, sir

301
00:19:55,728 --> 00:19:56,770
Love you

302
00:20:04,562 --> 00:20:05,687
Wow!

303
00:20:07,145 --> 00:20:08,312
Sorry, sir

304
00:20:09,423 --> 00:20:11,229
Is it okay I'm here
in my shooting costume?

305
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:13,354
- I know the costumer, not to worry
- Not that, sir

306
00:20:13,395 --> 00:20:15,187
- I'm there, right?
- True, right?

307
00:20:15,229 --> 00:20:18,811
Sir, this looks like the haunt
of the rich and famous

308
00:20:18,853 --> 00:20:21,437
In one go, can we spend
our hard earned money?

309
00:20:21,479 --> 00:20:24,618
If the rich frequent the pub
every week, it is their hobby

310
00:20:24,657 --> 00:20:27,354
We go when we feel like
to make ourselves happy

311
00:20:27,395 --> 00:20:28,604
Then let us go in, sir

312
00:20:29,405 --> 00:20:31,286
Didn't you want to visit a pub?

313
00:20:31,311 --> 00:20:33,054
Then why this change of mind?

314
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:35,496
- Are you playing a double game?
- No, sir

315
00:20:37,354 --> 00:20:38,978
You first
I'll follow, sir

316
00:20:53,187 --> 00:20:54,229
What is this, sir?

317
00:20:54,969 --> 00:20:57,678
It is jam packed like
a temple on new moon day

318
00:21:00,479 --> 00:21:02,853
New look, sir?
Coolers and all

319
00:21:02,895 --> 00:21:04,354
Gives a rich look, sir

320
00:21:04,687 --> 00:21:08,270
- How is it?
- So you've come well-prepared

321
00:21:08,312 --> 00:21:09,312
Yes, sir

322
00:21:11,646 --> 00:21:12,978
Excuse me

323
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,604
EXCUSE ME!

324
00:21:16,504 --> 00:21:17,962
[whistling loudly]

325
00:21:18,309 --> 00:21:20,071
You called out decently
and it wasn't heard

326
00:21:20,103 --> 00:21:21,196
My whistle did it!

327
00:21:21,227 --> 00:21:22,895
Hi sir, what would you like to have?

328
00:21:22,937 --> 00:21:25,062
- What is your name?
- Excuse me, sir

329
00:21:25,102 --> 00:21:26,779
What's your name?
Which area?

330
00:21:26,813 --> 00:21:28,646
Shantha kumar from Vannarapettai

331
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:30,895
Aren't you a local chap?
I'm also a local chap, eh?

332
00:21:30,937 --> 00:21:32,770
Then why this English between us?

333
00:21:32,811 --> 00:21:35,145
- How should you speak to me?
- Welcome, anna

334
00:21:35,171 --> 00:21:37,087
Vanakkam, anna
Please sit, bro

335
00:21:37,124 --> 00:21:39,055
- What is your order?
- That's the way to ask!

336
00:21:39,095 --> 00:21:42,012
Hello sir, what would you like to have?

337
00:21:42,062 --> 00:21:44,354
- Bring two 90
- Don't have 90, sir

338
00:21:44,395 --> 00:21:45,895
Only 60 and 30

339
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:49,395
You are being impudent
Do you get it?

340
00:21:49,437 --> 00:21:51,407
I follow the rules here, sir

341
00:21:51,511 --> 00:21:54,281
You're running a booze shop
and what rules are you talking about?

342
00:21:54,306 --> 00:21:55,680
- Get lost!
- WAIT, SIR

343
00:21:55,785 --> 00:21:56,785
HEY!

344
00:21:57,145 --> 00:21:59,145
Don't stipulate conditions to customer

345
00:21:59,187 --> 00:22:00,811
Customer is king!

346
00:22:00,853 --> 00:22:02,604
- Understand, go
- Okay, sir

347
00:22:02,646 --> 00:22:04,687
- Forget it!
- Apologize to him

348
00:22:04,937 --> 00:22:05,978
Sorry, sir

349
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:11,163
Cheers!

350
00:22:12,187 --> 00:22:13,229
Drink, sir

351
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:25,030
- Sir...?
- Hahn

352
00:22:25,064 --> 00:22:27,911
It's jam packed here and still
one chap is ogling at another chick

353
00:22:27,937 --> 00:22:30,229
- Who, sir?
- Turn this side

354
00:22:33,062 --> 00:22:35,770
'That's the way, lovely!'

355
00:22:45,596 --> 00:22:48,554
- Tell me, brother
- Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

356
00:22:48,604 --> 00:22:49,770
Why should I be ashamed?

357
00:22:49,811 --> 00:22:51,312
If you are dancing with your wife

358
00:22:51,354 --> 00:22:54,145
And some chap ogles like this,
how furious you'll be?

359
00:22:54,187 --> 00:22:55,562
Why should I lose my cool?

360
00:22:55,604 --> 00:22:56,770
That lady who is dancing

361
00:22:56,811 --> 00:22:58,145
She's my wife!

362
00:23:00,223 --> 00:23:02,713
'He's connecting person to person!'

363
00:23:03,229 --> 00:23:04,770
Why aren't you dancing with her?

364
00:23:04,811 --> 00:23:06,181
I don't know to dance

365
00:23:06,244 --> 00:23:08,187
She dances really well
only with him

366
00:23:08,229 --> 00:23:10,020
I'm just the audience, that's all

367
00:23:10,238 --> 00:23:13,238
Why take it to heart?
It's no big deal, brother

368
00:23:13,395 --> 00:23:16,955
Sir, am I making sense
or you think he's right?

369
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,520
Come what may, you are
people's favorite and always right

370
00:23:19,562 --> 00:23:20,937
Why do you even doubt this?

371
00:23:20,978 --> 00:23:22,395
- Tell me, sir
- Get my bill

372
00:23:22,437 --> 00:23:24,562
It's on the house, sir
Today is madam's birthday

373
00:23:24,604 --> 00:23:26,806
- She's paying for everyone
- Who is your madam?

374
00:23:26,838 --> 00:23:28,064
Madam-

375
00:23:29,614 --> 00:23:31,071
Madam...there she is

376
00:23:45,354 --> 00:23:48,417
Dai, bring the bill
for our booze, go

377
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,187
Who is the baby here?

378
00:24:03,479 --> 00:24:04,520
HEY!

379
00:24:07,783 --> 00:24:09,437
Announce a break for 5 minutes, sir

380
00:24:09,479 --> 00:24:12,437
You must be tired after drinking
Take rest for 5 minutes

381
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:14,908
Who is the birthday girl here?

382
00:24:15,672 --> 00:24:17,604
You, huh?
Happy birthday

383
00:24:17,837 --> 00:24:18,837
Thanks

384
00:24:18,973 --> 00:24:20,682
If it's your birthday
treat your friends

385
00:24:20,724 --> 00:24:22,724
Why buy drinks for strangers like us?

386
00:24:22,772 --> 00:24:24,439
- It's my treat
- Balls!

387
00:24:25,229 --> 00:24:26,937
- Want me to repeat it?
- What?

388
00:24:27,182 --> 00:24:29,270
Treat your friends or
your employees on your birthday

389
00:24:29,312 --> 00:24:31,354
Or help out people
in your neighborhood

390
00:24:31,395 --> 00:24:33,275
It will be a blessing
to your entire lineage

391
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:35,229
Only the rich who can afford come here

392
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:36,978
What do you gain
by giving him freebies?

393
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:39,520
- Listen here-
- Forgive me if I said something wrong

394
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:42,120
I won't apologize like that
because I'm not wrong

395
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,562
Sir, why are you talking to her?

396
00:24:45,604 --> 00:24:48,187
- Go on, find your way out
- 'When did I speak to her?'

397
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,662
Hey! Whom are you
trying to knock down?

398
00:24:50,725 --> 00:24:51,728
GO!

399
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:53,229
A man shouldn't look good!

400
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:55,103
'She would've hit on me
He ruined even that!'

401
00:24:55,145 --> 00:24:57,270
- Sir, you keep going
- Leave me alone, sir

402
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:00,479
That's it, what I say goes

403
00:25:01,103 --> 00:25:02,145
What?

404
00:25:02,562 --> 00:25:05,062
- Dai! Continue
- Who is this fellow?

405
00:25:07,145 --> 00:25:09,196
- What, sir?
- What more do you want to do?

406
00:25:09,251 --> 00:25:12,103
- Did I do something wrong, sir?
- When have you ever been wrong?

407
00:25:12,145 --> 00:25:14,062
You measure every word you speak

408
00:25:14,103 --> 00:25:15,770
You didn't even give the bill

409
00:25:17,895 --> 00:25:20,145
You created a scene
to imprint your face in her mind

410
00:25:20,187 --> 00:25:21,770
- Is that so?
- Of course

411
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:23,312
Won't that girl ask her friends?

412
00:25:23,354 --> 00:25:25,520
Who is he? What does he do?
Where is he from?

413
00:25:25,562 --> 00:25:27,532
Won't they also fill up the blanks?

414
00:25:27,604 --> 00:25:28,860
Good lord!

415
00:25:29,646 --> 00:25:31,811
You know it all
No one can fool you, sir

416
00:25:31,853 --> 00:25:33,937
Don't know how I can match
your acting skill, sir?

417
00:25:33,978 --> 00:25:35,687
Somehow please save me, sir

418
00:25:35,728 --> 00:25:36,895
Come, sir
Let's go

419
00:25:39,853 --> 00:25:43,103
He washed all the dirty linen happily
Why is he wringing me to drip-dry?

420
00:25:46,334 --> 00:25:48,021
Happy birthday, my darling

421
00:25:48,305 --> 00:25:49,430
Thanks, dad

422
00:25:50,062 --> 00:25:52,270
I thought you would
call me at 12:01

423
00:25:52,837 --> 00:25:55,628
I thought you will be busy
So didn't want to disturb you

424
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:58,232
- Coffee
- Okay

425
00:25:58,485 --> 00:25:59,860
I'll call you back

426
00:26:02,918 --> 00:26:05,990
'Maruthamangalam - Theni District'

427
00:26:11,357 --> 00:26:13,649
- Won't you measure 1 kg correctly, bro?
- Go, lady

428
00:26:13,682 --> 00:26:15,057
Your measuring sucks

429
00:26:15,099 --> 00:26:16,958
If he says it is over
wait and watch!

430
00:26:16,995 --> 00:26:18,745
- Measure properly
- Get lost!

431
00:26:18,787 --> 00:26:21,204
Groceries are all over
Clear off, everyone

432
00:26:21,245 --> 00:26:23,495
You gave hardly 10 people
How can it be over?

433
00:26:23,537 --> 00:26:25,745
How will I answer the people
of the neighboring town?

434
00:26:25,787 --> 00:26:27,954
Are people of this town mad
to tolerate this atrocity?

435
00:26:27,995 --> 00:26:30,333
What are you doing with
the groceries you get?

436
00:26:30,372 --> 00:26:32,162
I didn't get any stock
Do what you want

437
00:26:32,204 --> 00:26:34,232
- We shouldn't spare him
- Take your hands off!

438
00:26:34,271 --> 00:26:36,287
[overlap of angry voices]

439
00:26:36,329 --> 00:26:37,951
Silence!
Look here

440
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:39,287
No use talking to him

441
00:26:39,329 --> 00:26:41,919
We will solve this
at the right place

442
00:26:41,963 --> 00:26:43,297
Come along
Follow me

443
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:48,912
Collector has arrived
Get up, all of you

444
00:26:48,954 --> 00:26:52,037
- Let's tell him our problem
- Yes, tell him everything

445
00:26:52,293 --> 00:26:53,789
- Sir
- Good afternoon, sir

446
00:26:53,814 --> 00:26:54,916
Vanakkam

447
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:57,180
- What is this?
- They are waiting from morning

448
00:26:57,214 --> 00:26:58,881
They are refusing to leave, sir

449
00:26:58,954 --> 00:27:01,537
Why are all of you protesting
in front of the police station?

450
00:27:01,579 --> 00:27:04,245
Sir, we have no access
to benefits granted by the Govt

451
00:27:04,287 --> 00:27:08,232
Hardly 10 people are given groceries
in the Govt ration shop, sir

452
00:27:08,271 --> 00:27:10,162
He claims Govt allocation was so low

453
00:27:10,204 --> 00:27:13,886
We have no rice or lentils
to feed our children

454
00:27:13,933 --> 00:27:16,737
Even our roads are not well lit
when we walk home at night

455
00:27:16,787 --> 00:27:18,787
- Even that power supply is cut
- Yes, sir

456
00:27:18,829 --> 00:27:21,412
We have no school facilities
for our children to study

457
00:27:21,454 --> 00:27:23,537
Sir, our hospital is just
a namesake establishment

458
00:27:23,579 --> 00:27:26,662
There aren't any doctors
nor any medical supplies, sir

459
00:27:26,714 --> 00:27:29,646
Do you know how we suffer
to get drinking water, sir?

460
00:27:29,706 --> 00:27:32,488
If we go to the neighboring town
to get water we are driven away

461
00:27:32,537 --> 00:27:34,005
Should we suffer like this?

462
00:27:34,037 --> 00:27:35,954
We are depending
on you to save us, sir

463
00:27:35,995 --> 00:27:37,193
My hands are tied

464
00:27:37,232 --> 00:27:40,451
You returned your voter IDs
and declined the need for elections

465
00:27:40,495 --> 00:27:41,872
What arrogance!

466
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:43,037
Is it his words?

467
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:45,287
He's repeating like a parrot
what he has been taught

468
00:27:45,329 --> 00:27:47,579
Is this how we get punished
for repealing elections?

469
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,412
What is the solution, sir?

470
00:27:49,454 --> 00:27:53,329
Your wants will be fulfilled
only if you say 'yes' to elections

471
00:27:53,591 --> 00:27:56,435
Withdraw your election repeal

472
00:27:56,474 --> 00:27:58,620
Will we be alive
till we vote, sir?

473
00:27:58,662 --> 00:28:00,495
It is all our wretched fate

474
00:28:00,537 --> 00:28:02,537
'We won't gain anything
appealing to them'

475
00:28:02,579 --> 00:28:04,120
- Let's go
- Calls himself a collector

476
00:28:04,162 --> 00:28:06,162
- Clear out now
- It's a no win situation

477
00:28:08,755 --> 00:28:10,865
What are the people saying?

478
00:28:10,912 --> 00:28:12,287
Ignore their pleas

479
00:28:12,479 --> 00:28:14,537
I repeated verbatim
whatever you asked me to

480
00:28:14,579 --> 00:28:16,704
I don't know how long this will last

481
00:28:17,185 --> 00:28:18,977
It is not your place to comment

482
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:23,534
They have started lamenting only now

483
00:28:24,872 --> 00:28:26,205
It will change

484
00:28:28,188 --> 00:28:29,438
Change is imminent

Thank you very much, swami

498
00:29:03,321 --> 00:29:04,662
- He got his due
- Here, sir

499
00:29:04,704 --> 00:29:06,245
Ah! No...no
I don't take money

Thank you

501
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,412
I don't accept cash
Please hand it over to her

502
00:29:09,454 --> 00:29:11,680
- I thought as much
- You charge Rs 1000 it seems

503
00:29:11,719 --> 00:29:14,266
I don't have balance to give you
Let me read your palm also

504
00:29:14,299 --> 00:29:16,383
- It's okay, I'll take leave
- Don't make a fuss

505
00:29:16,412 --> 00:29:17,995
- Show your palm to him
- I feel shy

506
00:29:18,037 --> 00:29:19,037
He should feel shy!

00:29:50,829 --> 00:29:52,079
- 'Bro'
- Swami

516
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,579
From my mouth to God's ears
my prophesy will come true

517
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:57,204
After it happens
you'll come in search of me

518
00:29:57,245 --> 00:29:59,450
Even if it doesn't
we'll come in search of you!

519
00:29:59,485 --> 00:30:00,735
'What a curse!'

520
00:30:00,829 --> 00:30:02,412
- Congratulations, sir
- Thank you, sir

521
00:30:02,454 --> 00:30:03,810
- I'll take leave
- Bless you

522
00:30:03,856 --> 00:30:05,037
Hold on, sir

523
00:30:05,079 --> 00:30:07,620
You'll leave as soon as
your job is done, huh?

524
00:30:07,829 --> 00:30:10,957
Be calm and listen to
what's in store for my palm

525
00:30:11,007 --> 00:30:12,340
Kindly take a look, swami

526
00:30:12,388 --> 00:30:14,805
Come on
Show me your palm

527
00:30:16,454 --> 00:30:17,495
Cha!

528
00:30:17,537 --> 00:30:20,325
Bro, don't show your hand to anyone

529
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:21,829
It will be chopped to pieces

530
00:30:22,037 --> 00:30:25,079
That's all I can say now
I don't like to be negative

531
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,204
You look like a negative
that hasn't been printed

532
00:30:27,245 --> 00:30:28,954
'Who are you to foretell, black ape?'

533
00:30:28,995 --> 00:30:30,079
How humiliating!

534
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,537
Thinks he's Nostradamus
He predicts only with cowrie shells

535
00:30:32,579 --> 00:30:35,120
May justice lift its righteous head

536
00:30:35,162 --> 00:30:36,412
Jai Hind!

537
00:30:37,579 --> 00:30:39,579
They made my skull piping hot!

538
00:30:43,995 --> 00:30:45,037
Cool

539
00:30:46,461 --> 00:30:47,502
Next

540
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,370
Your faces tell me

541
00:30:55,412 --> 00:30:58,013
...you're slightly on the affluent side

542
00:30:58,044 --> 00:31:02,466
But you want an alliance from our family
That seems like a surprise twist

543
00:31:02,513 --> 00:31:05,099
We decided to find
a bride for our son

544
00:31:05,149 --> 00:31:07,024
What does it matter
mansion or mud house?

545
00:31:07,051 --> 00:31:08,880
Are you saying we live
in a mud house?

546
00:31:08,919 --> 00:31:11,162
Father-in-law, please stay out of this

547
00:31:11,204 --> 00:31:13,224
- Go and bring the 'bride'
- Okay

548
00:31:13,255 --> 00:31:15,794
Our girl is so-so
Not worth seeing

549
00:31:15,836 --> 00:31:17,474
You and your jinxed mouth!

550
00:31:17,521 --> 00:31:19,188
Why do you spoil for a fight?

551
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:23,951
'Come to my home', huh?

552
00:31:29,547 --> 00:31:31,380
Do you like her, son?

553
00:31:32,887 --> 00:31:34,021
Very much

554
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:35,704
We like your daughter

555
00:31:35,756 --> 00:31:37,048
Is that so?

556
00:31:37,895 --> 00:31:39,995
Shall we discuss all the other details?

557
00:31:40,037 --> 00:31:41,954
What is there to discuss, sir?

558
00:31:41,995 --> 00:31:45,495
I won't give a naya paisa
in the name of 'dowry'

559
00:31:45,782 --> 00:31:48,073
Did we even mention the word?

560
00:31:48,162 --> 00:31:50,079
It's very difficult to find a good bride

561
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,995
Gold, right?
We can save later

562
00:31:52,591 --> 00:31:54,321
He has come prepared to say 'yes'

563
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:57,912
I won't agree if you ask
for a bike or car

564
00:31:57,954 --> 00:31:59,731
We have all that, sir

565
00:31:59,766 --> 00:32:02,231
They are in favor of this alliance

566
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:04,495
'Why are you listing out
one by one from memory?'

567
00:32:04,537 --> 00:32:05,704
Keep quiet, son-in-law

568
00:32:05,745 --> 00:32:08,778
My granddaughter will
visit us every Friday

569
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,883
She'll go back to your house
only on Monday

570
00:32:10,911 --> 00:32:13,744
Even I can't part from my son for 2 days

571
00:32:13,787 --> 00:32:15,954
'She can stay with you
for a whole week if you want'

572
00:32:15,987 --> 00:32:17,821
'How do I get rid of them?'

573
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:20,162
Here comes the star of our house

574
00:32:20,204 --> 00:32:21,537
Good afternoon

575
00:32:21,579 --> 00:32:22,704
'Vanakkam', sir

576
00:32:23,057 --> 00:32:25,914
- Where do you work?
- I'm trying for a chance to act in films

577
00:32:25,954 --> 00:32:27,037
Cinema, huh?

578
00:32:27,329 --> 00:32:29,995
Dozens of youngsters are waiting
in every street with their photos

579
00:32:30,036 --> 00:32:31,661
How can you survive on that income?

580
00:32:31,704 --> 00:32:33,105
No, if I get a good chance

581
00:32:33,136 --> 00:32:35,770
...I can earn enough to have
the income tax department raid me

582
00:32:35,805 --> 00:32:38,622
My eldest son runs 6 xerox shops

583
00:32:38,662 --> 00:32:40,239
'Why don't you help him?'

584
00:32:40,278 --> 00:32:41,544
It is very remunerative

585
00:32:41,583 --> 00:32:44,086
Why be obsessed with cinema
and make a joke out of it?

586
00:32:44,104 --> 00:32:45,247
You're mistaken, sir

587
00:32:45,287 --> 00:32:46,370
Get up, man

588
00:32:46,412 --> 00:32:48,411
You keep jabbering
Get up, man

589
00:32:48,442 --> 00:32:50,245
Who are you to offer
my brother a job?

590
00:32:50,287 --> 00:32:51,870
How dare you call him a joker!

591
00:32:51,912 --> 00:32:53,787
- Mind your words
- Get out of my house

592
00:32:56,370 --> 00:32:58,287
Hey! Keep quiet

593
00:32:58,473 --> 00:33:00,088
Why are you hitting our son?

594
00:33:00,115 --> 00:33:02,115
Step outside and
hit your son all you want

595
00:33:02,157 --> 00:33:04,073
'Serves me right for
seeking this alliance'

596
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:06,172
1 minute, wait, sir
I'll convince my family

597
00:33:06,213 --> 00:33:08,005
Please wait
Let's talk it over

598
00:33:08,055 --> 00:33:10,346
- Let him go
- As if we need his advice!

599
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:12,180
- Your dreams
- He's so thick skinned

600
00:33:12,213 --> 00:33:14,183
- And goal they are trying to bury
- 1 minute

601
00:33:14,224 --> 00:33:15,516
1 MINUTE
KEEP QUIET!

602
00:33:16,396 --> 00:33:20,255
What did they say that was new?
As if you haven't said the same, huh?

603
00:33:20,305 --> 00:33:21,930
They were quite decent

604
00:33:22,787 --> 00:33:25,394
Why this sudden overflow
of care and concern over me?

605
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,399
I'll take your limbs apart
if you laugh like this

606
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:32,472
This sister of yours waits till the groom
gets down from the auto at our doorstep

607
00:33:32,537 --> 00:33:37,704
And then announces, 'I love someone
I'll kill myself if I don't marry him'

608
00:33:37,735 --> 00:33:39,735
'Did we raise her, for her to die?'

609
00:33:39,763 --> 00:33:42,722
Why didn't you blurt this out
when you asked me to match horoscopes?

610
00:33:42,745 --> 00:33:44,787
Did I give you this groom's
horoscope to match?

611
00:33:44,829 --> 00:33:46,912
I gave you my lover's horoscope, bro

612
00:33:46,954 --> 00:33:48,745
Why dress to kill
for a groom you dislike?

613
00:33:48,787 --> 00:33:49,912
'Well asked, my son'

614
00:33:49,954 --> 00:33:51,333
Your sister has even asked

615
00:33:51,364 --> 00:33:53,614
...that lover boy to come here at 4:00 pm

616
00:33:53,657 --> 00:33:56,865
He is coming with his parents
in an auto, on the way

617
00:33:58,804 --> 00:33:59,804
Yes, bro

618
00:34:01,544 --> 00:34:04,075
These people were glued to their seats

619
00:34:04,122 --> 00:34:07,216
I went through hell
before I could pack them off

620
00:34:07,263 --> 00:34:08,896
But you made it easy for us

621
00:34:08,927 --> 00:34:10,818
Clear all this rubbish now

622
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:12,141
You can also step out

623
00:34:13,037 --> 00:34:15,852
Why glare daggers at me?
We need you only to stop a wedding

624
00:34:15,883 --> 00:34:19,067
This is a match that should be confirmed
Better if you're absent, see you

625
00:34:19,117 --> 00:34:20,325
Oho!

626
00:34:20,927 --> 00:34:22,200
Listen, Mr Murthy

627
00:34:22,259 --> 00:34:26,333
If your name was not on
our Govt ID as head of the family

628
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:28,495
...you won't have this roof over your head

629
00:34:28,537 --> 00:34:30,037
We'll discuss all this later

630
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:32,013
Get ready, my dear

631
00:34:32,037 --> 00:34:34,829
How much can I handle at this age?

632
00:34:34,912 --> 00:34:36,662
- 'Irresponsible lot'
- Listen!

633
00:34:36,704 --> 00:34:38,454
My bro-in-law is the breadwinner

634
00:34:38,495 --> 00:34:39,829
'Even he is zipping his lips'

635
00:34:39,857 --> 00:34:42,091
Are you creating a scene,
you addicted gambler?

636
00:34:42,114 --> 00:34:43,531
I know how to get even!

637
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:46,747
Why drag my husband in
your father-son squabble?

638
00:34:46,787 --> 00:34:49,899
I've buttered up your husband
He'll be in a good mood, go and check

639
00:34:49,954 --> 00:34:52,579
- No respect for your akka
- Won't invite me for your wedding?

640
00:34:52,611 --> 00:34:55,028
- You are 1st on our list, bro
- Smack you, get lost!

641
00:34:56,202 --> 00:34:57,663
'Auto is here'

642
00:34:57,688 --> 00:34:59,522
'Ask this man the address'

643
00:35:00,204 --> 00:35:01,912
Which is Mr Murthy's house?

644
00:35:03,947 --> 00:35:04,950
You are...?

645
00:35:04,971 --> 00:35:06,096
No idea!

646
00:35:07,076 --> 00:35:09,048
I'm hungry, let me
help myself to an apple

647
00:35:10,242 --> 00:35:11,408
Come, we'll go in

648
00:35:12,736 --> 00:35:15,653
Hi students, you all should
remember one thing

649
00:35:15,704 --> 00:35:17,287
You are studying photography

650
00:35:17,329 --> 00:35:20,620
For students taking up History and Math
classroom is their world

651
00:35:20,662 --> 00:35:22,372
For you, world is your classroom

652
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:24,245
'You'll be exposed to a whole new world'

653
00:35:24,287 --> 00:35:26,120
If you take just 1 shot

654
00:35:26,162 --> 00:35:28,437
...it should be lively
and well chosen

655
00:35:28,505 --> 00:35:29,984
It should tell you a story

656
00:35:30,037 --> 00:35:31,454
Your assignment this time

657
00:35:31,495 --> 00:35:33,370
Within 7 days
you have to submit

658
00:35:33,412 --> 00:35:34,704
- Sushma
- Sir

659
00:35:34,745 --> 00:35:36,370
Your topic is 'Sculptures'

660
00:35:36,412 --> 00:35:37,787
Go to Mahabalipuram

661
00:35:37,829 --> 00:35:42,468
Go and click beautiful snaps
of the sculptures over there

662
00:35:42,537 --> 00:35:44,787
I'll give you Ravindran's number

663
00:35:44,989 --> 00:35:46,906
He'll be very helpful

664
00:35:46,988 --> 00:35:49,071
You don't stand like a sculpture!

665
00:35:49,922 --> 00:35:51,281
Okay, Savitha

666
00:35:51,329 --> 00:35:53,333
- Sir
- Food photography

667
00:35:53,829 --> 00:35:55,287
Then Kamalini

668
00:35:55,329 --> 00:35:58,204
- Sir?
- 'Housing board lifestyle' is your subject

669
00:35:58,537 --> 00:36:00,162
Actually you're very fortunate

670
00:36:00,204 --> 00:36:03,704
'You'll get varied subjects
and expressions over there'

671
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:05,537
I'll refer you to one Mr Guru

672
00:36:05,579 --> 00:36:07,162
I'll forward his number to you

673
00:36:07,201 --> 00:36:08,701
'Contact him for any help'

674
00:36:11,579 --> 00:36:14,200
[humming a song from 'En Annan']

675
00:36:14,833 --> 00:36:16,120
Waitees, madam

676
00:36:16,162 --> 00:36:18,037
- Why is he here?
- Muruga!

677
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:19,454
Sit down

678
00:36:19,787 --> 00:36:20,829
Thanks

679
00:36:21,162 --> 00:36:22,620
Met him in the pub-

680
00:36:22,829 --> 00:36:25,704
- 4-5 college girls are here
- What for?

681
00:36:25,745 --> 00:36:27,329
Some project it seems

682
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:29,412
Went above my head
So I brought them to you

683
00:36:29,454 --> 00:36:30,810
Did you get a commission?

684
00:36:30,856 --> 00:36:33,329
I've brought them to you
Will I even dare to ask?

685
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:35,120
- I swear, no
- Then why bring them here?

686
00:36:35,162 --> 00:36:36,412
'They have cameras'

687
00:36:36,454 --> 00:36:39,787
Photo or cinema means in our area
I can only think of you

688
00:36:39,829 --> 00:36:42,329
Don't lay it too thick
Bring them over

689
00:36:42,495 --> 00:36:43,867
- Want tea?
- It's okay, Muruga

690
00:36:43,905 --> 00:36:45,656
Then pay the bill

691
00:36:47,563 --> 00:36:48,704
Isn't it wrong, sir?

692
00:36:48,743 --> 00:36:51,034
It isn't a crime at all
to make use of chaps like this

693
00:36:51,057 --> 00:36:53,020
Handle him with care

694
00:36:53,079 --> 00:36:54,662
- Okay?
- Thank you

695
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:57,881
DD, sir

696
00:36:57,938 --> 00:36:59,563
- Sir?
- Drunken dance

697
00:36:59,596 --> 00:37:01,638
We saw her in the pub
Birthday baby

698
00:37:01,704 --> 00:37:03,704
Try to look sad and pathetic

699
00:37:06,537 --> 00:37:08,704
In the pink of health
drowning in those spirits!

700
00:37:08,745 --> 00:37:09,954
Speak decently, sir

701
00:37:09,995 --> 00:37:12,370
- Hi
- Sit down

702
00:37:12,875 --> 00:37:14,875
- Would you like tea?
- No, thank you

703
00:37:14,912 --> 00:37:16,204
What about you?

704
00:37:16,245 --> 00:37:18,037
You won't drink here
What I can do for you?

705
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:19,495
First of all, sorry

706
00:37:19,708 --> 00:37:20,750
Why?

707
00:37:20,954 --> 00:37:23,020
That pub incident the other day

708
00:37:23,091 --> 00:37:24,951
'I reflected on what I did'

709
00:37:24,995 --> 00:37:26,579
What I did was wrong

710
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:28,454
- Oho!
- I'll change my ways now

711
00:37:28,495 --> 00:37:30,474
Don't change your habit
for random strangers

712
00:37:30,505 --> 00:37:32,954
Reform if you feel it is right
Or else maintain your attitude

713
00:37:32,995 --> 00:37:34,162
- Punch?
- Sounds nice, sir

714
00:37:34,204 --> 00:37:35,329
Come to the point

715
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:39,162
'Housing board' is a project
for my photography course

716
00:37:39,763 --> 00:37:42,704
I'll express the struggles here
through the photos I click

717
00:37:42,745 --> 00:37:45,454
You'll mint money
out of our hardship, huh?

718
00:37:45,495 --> 00:37:48,620
Our struggles are of no use to us
Let them at least benefit

719
00:37:49,037 --> 00:37:50,704
Expose only our struggles or what?

720
00:37:50,745 --> 00:37:53,662
No, I'll showcase your happiness too

721
00:37:55,954 --> 00:37:57,620
You'll be envious of us
Shall we?

722
00:37:57,662 --> 00:37:59,372
- They will click you also, sir
- For sure

723
00:37:59,416 --> 00:38:02,041
- They play out in the streets
- Politicians play in our lives!

724
00:38:02,083 --> 00:38:03,166
Vanakkam, bro

725
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:05,381
Yellow shirt, Philips anna
Meet and greet him

726
00:38:05,429 --> 00:38:07,585
They are here to click photos, bro

727
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:08,911
Ask them to do a good job

728
00:38:08,936 --> 00:38:10,662
- Recognize this game?
- No, we don't

729
00:38:10,704 --> 00:38:13,489
You roll this round ball
in shopping malls and show off

730
00:38:13,537 --> 00:38:16,704
- Slow bowling or fast bowling
- This is our area's snow bowling

731
00:38:17,172 --> 00:38:19,755
All smart kids but won't go
beyond 10th grade in our area

732
00:38:19,805 --> 00:38:21,305
Isn't our Govt aiding them?

733
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:23,830
How? Education will give knowledge

734
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:26,120
Knowledge will give us jobs
Will it appease our hunger?

735
00:38:26,162 --> 00:38:27,329
Click your photos

736
00:38:27,369 --> 00:38:29,629
Hold your ammunition in your hand

737
00:38:29,896 --> 00:38:31,021
Pick it up

738
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:32,495
Gather everything

739
00:38:36,012 --> 00:38:37,425
She is Selvi akka of our area

740
00:38:37,458 --> 00:38:38,500
'Look at her blushing'

741
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:40,340
When dogs sleep
she'll get up like a ghost

742
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:42,495
Knot her hair, pour the batter in a mud pot

743
00:38:42,537 --> 00:38:45,745
...thinking of her mother-in-law and
sister-in-law, twist, turn right and left

744
00:38:45,787 --> 00:38:49,145
She'll slide the fritters into boiling oil
and take them out crisp and crunchy

745
00:38:49,188 --> 00:38:51,729
Wow! Our tastebuds will dance in joy!

746
00:38:51,779 --> 00:38:54,946
But if akka washes her hands
I don't guarantee the taste!

747
00:38:54,995 --> 00:38:56,841
- Sorry, sis
- Akka...fun!

748
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,543
Why lose your cool?
Pose for the photo

749
00:38:58,579 --> 00:39:00,551
- Go ahead and click
- Take it

750
00:39:00,959 --> 00:39:04,126
Selvi akka, smile
That's my beauty queen!

751
00:39:04,188 --> 00:39:05,188
Click!

752
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:07,049
He is our area's costume designer

753
00:39:07,098 --> 00:39:09,370
He's the reason for our boys
being stylish and slick

754
00:39:09,412 --> 00:39:11,745
If you give him a pattern
from a magazine or newspaper

755
00:39:11,787 --> 00:39:14,120
He'll copy it to the T and
fling it on your face in 1 hour

756
00:39:14,162 --> 00:39:16,412
Talent 100%
But poverty is 101%

757
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:19,579
That's why he's stuck in this hell hole
But he'll come up in life soon, bro?

758
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:20,620
Take your photo

759
00:39:20,662 --> 00:39:21,912
Pose for the camera

760
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,371
This is our Mary akka's shop

761
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:26,762
Just like how 'bhajji'
is special in our beach

762
00:39:26,824 --> 00:39:31,412
...our akka has the best handicrafts
to decorate your shelf at home

763
00:39:31,495 --> 00:39:33,412
Mary akka
Flash your smile

764
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:35,787
This is the last stop for today

765
00:39:35,829 --> 00:39:37,287
If you want more
come tomorrow

766
00:39:37,329 --> 00:39:38,912
I'll take you around
You can click more

767
00:39:38,954 --> 00:39:39,995
Okay

768
00:39:40,037 --> 00:39:42,079
She said she would take a photo of us

769
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,411
- Ask her
- Hello?

770
00:39:43,448 --> 00:39:44,573
Excuse me

771
00:39:45,388 --> 00:39:46,704
You forgot to click us?

772
00:39:46,745 --> 00:39:49,388
- Er...I forgot
- How can you forget?

773
00:39:49,434 --> 00:39:51,112
I clicked the snaps
I forgot to show you

774
00:39:51,162 --> 00:39:52,954
- Then show us
- Tell me your number

775
00:39:52,995 --> 00:39:54,856
- 733...
- Tell me your number

776
00:39:54,896 --> 00:39:56,403
Sir just gave you his number

777
00:39:56,459 --> 00:39:58,059
I asked for your number

778
00:39:59,204 --> 00:40:02,590
'He'll call me a hero everywhere
Now sudden 'Ghajini' memory!'

779
00:40:02,641 --> 00:40:04,516
- Didn't get
- You will

780
00:40:05,172 --> 00:40:06,463
1 minute

781
00:40:07,787 --> 00:40:09,204
I like you

782
00:40:10,357 --> 00:40:11,565
Don't get me wrong

783
00:40:11,615 --> 00:40:13,907
I like you, wanted to know
if we can be friends

784
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:15,995
Alright

785
00:40:16,162 --> 00:40:17,301
I got it

786
00:40:18,245 --> 00:40:20,079
- Thanks
- Enjoy

787
00:40:20,107 --> 00:40:21,482
Sir, look at this

788
00:40:22,981 --> 00:40:24,189
What is this, sir?

789
00:40:24,388 --> 00:40:26,638
That girl has clicked only me, huh?

790
00:40:27,263 --> 00:40:29,055
Look...look here, sir

791
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:31,619
Here, in this corner

792
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:33,848
'Why are you hiding and peeping?'

793
00:40:33,888 --> 00:40:35,902
Why didn't you come into the frame?

794
00:40:41,341 --> 00:40:43,981
"In my eyes a butterfly smiles enticing"

795
00:40:44,037 --> 00:40:46,787
"In my heart it sprouts wings rejoicing"

796
00:40:52,037 --> 00:40:54,620
"In my eyes a butterfly
smiles irresistible"

797
00:40:54,662 --> 00:40:57,495
"In my heart it sprouts wings invisible"

798
00:41:02,495 --> 00:41:07,370
"Happiness in everything I see
My heart liquefies in ecstasy"

799
00:41:07,412 --> 00:41:12,912
"In the palm of my hand tight
is my laughter clasped in delight?"

800
00:41:12,954 --> 00:41:15,745
"In everything I hear, rhythm echoes to me"

801
00:41:15,787 --> 00:41:18,120
"In all that moves, dancing feet I see"

802
00:41:18,162 --> 00:41:23,495
"In my breath's journey
a fragrant festival spree"

803
00:41:23,787 --> 00:41:29,079
"The wonderful wind whispers in my ear
Dusty earth chats with my feet so clear"

804
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:34,120
"Whose words will I hear?"

805
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:39,842
"Flowers stop me with their heads crooning
My companion pulls me fondly beckoning"

806
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:44,642
"Whose call will I comply unquestioning?"

807
00:41:45,259 --> 00:41:50,509
"Beauty in all her grace
invites with a smiling face"

808
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:56,009
"Budding wings of love so true
bloom and blossom anew"

809
00:41:56,050 --> 00:42:01,217
"Beauty in all her enchantment
allures with an air of amusement"

810
00:42:01,259 --> 00:42:06,592
"Budding wings of love and shyness
bloom and blossom in earnest"

811
00:42:06,634 --> 00:42:11,634
"Happiness in everything I see
My heart liquefies in ecstasy"

812
00:42:11,675 --> 00:42:16,842
"In the palm of my hand tight
is my laughter clasped in delight?"

813
00:42:17,228 --> 00:42:22,125
"In everything I hear, rhythm echoes to me
In all that moves, dancing feet I see"

814
00:42:22,175 --> 00:42:27,467
"In my breath's journey
a fragrant festival spree"

815
00:42:27,884 --> 00:42:33,217
"The wonderful wind whispers in my ear
Dusty earth chats with my feet so clear"

816
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:38,217
"Whose words will I now hear?"

817
00:42:38,509 --> 00:42:43,800
"Flowers stop me with their heads crooning
My companion pulls me fondly beckoning"

818
00:42:43,884 --> 00:42:48,592
"Whose call will I comply unquestioning?"

819
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:11,384
You called me so many times

820
00:43:11,425 --> 00:43:13,431
I was in a seminar
That's why I couldn't answer

821
00:43:13,467 --> 00:43:15,447
- Pick up that invitation
- For whom?

822
00:43:15,478 --> 00:43:16,845
My sister's wedding

823
00:43:16,876 --> 00:43:19,764
Take a look and contribute generously

824
00:43:19,789 --> 00:43:21,141
Show your power!

825
00:43:21,211 --> 00:43:23,467
The other day I saw you in the pub

826
00:43:23,509 --> 00:43:25,598
You are here now, why?

827
00:43:25,661 --> 00:43:27,509
- Because
- Let me answer

828
00:43:27,541 --> 00:43:29,775
Elephant needs sugarcane grove
to appease its hunger

829
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,445
But an ant needs just the residue

830
00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:34,203
When wallet heavy, elephant
when pocket empty be an ant

831
00:43:34,228 --> 00:43:36,043
Aiyo! What a punch line, sir!

832
00:43:36,087 --> 00:43:39,170
Hearing his punch lines
don't try to impress him

833
00:43:39,215 --> 00:43:40,610
He won't fall for your bait

834
00:43:40,658 --> 00:43:42,422
You tried to impress him in the pub?

835
00:43:42,469 --> 00:43:46,001
Sir, you're Tamil Nadu's treasure trove
Don't try to slip away so soon

836
00:43:46,039 --> 00:43:49,007
- Even I want 2 'idlis'
- My plate tempted you, huh?

837
00:43:49,049 --> 00:43:53,424
"Like a delicate flower as a princess
I was wrapped in cool comfort of affluence"

838
00:43:53,467 --> 00:43:54,509
Yummy

839
00:43:55,134 --> 00:43:56,759
'I wanted to tell you right then'

840
00:43:56,791 --> 00:43:58,695
Actually I'm the hero
He's the comedian

841
00:43:59,509 --> 00:44:04,800
"Inside a matchbox with bare minimum
I found the azure sky extend maximum"

842
00:44:04,845 --> 00:44:09,803
"On a 'dosa' pan; way to my heart
I found love, never to part"

843
00:44:09,852 --> 00:44:12,477
"In my eyes a butterfly smiles enticing"

844
00:44:12,508 --> 00:44:15,259
"In my heart it sprouts wings rejoicing"

845
00:44:15,326 --> 00:44:17,868
"Without knocking my world has opened"

846
00:44:17,912 --> 00:44:20,329
"All of a sudden this has happened"

847
00:44:20,521 --> 00:44:23,188
"In my eyes a butterfly
smiles irresistible"

848
00:44:23,221 --> 00:44:25,805
"In my heart it sprouts wings invisible"

849
00:44:25,865 --> 00:44:28,448
"Without knocking my world has opened"

850
00:44:28,514 --> 00:44:30,306
"Vibes clicked and this has happened"

851
00:44:30,365 --> 00:44:35,740
"Nothing else, I conclude
My heart doesn't need, dude"

852
00:44:35,828 --> 00:44:40,946
"Dearest, we'll seize the moment
Hand in hand, with wonderment"

853
00:44:41,002 --> 00:44:46,252
"Like a shooting star, love
I fell from the sky above"

854
00:44:46,345 --> 00:44:52,470
"In one single day I lived a lifetime
Thanks to you, my love sublime"

855
00:44:52,562 --> 00:44:57,978
"Beauty in all her grace
invites with a smiling face"

856
00:44:58,091 --> 00:45:03,120
"Budding wings of love so true
bloom and blossom anew"

857
00:45:03,168 --> 00:45:07,542
"Budding wings of love and shyness
bloom and blossom in earnest"

858
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:21,899
We've already invested a lot
for this project in Theni, sir

859
00:45:22,730 --> 00:45:24,230
But as of now

860
00:45:24,393 --> 00:45:27,893
It is a tough proposition considering
the present situation of that hillock town

861
00:45:28,859 --> 00:45:30,793
You said there's land
available near Krishnagiri?

862
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:36,653
Either it is closer to residential areas
Otherwise it is reserve forest area

863
00:45:36,695 --> 00:45:38,737
Bengal, Sikkim, Haryana

864
00:45:38,778 --> 00:45:42,862
Only reason our projects
were rejected in these 3 states

865
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:45,491
Issues in the chemicals we dumped

866
00:45:45,515 --> 00:45:47,945
I don't know what methods you'll resort to

867
00:45:47,987 --> 00:45:50,028
'Construction has to start
within 2 months'

868
00:45:50,088 --> 00:45:52,671
Only the good news
you've registered the land

869
00:45:52,788 --> 00:45:54,538
...is what my ears should hear!

870
00:45:56,408 --> 00:45:59,783
How will we leave it?
I'll handle everything

871
00:46:02,395 --> 00:46:03,687
Vanakkam, bro

872
00:46:08,564 --> 00:46:12,507
Hello, Gopi, looks like
your business is booming, huh?

873
00:46:12,801 --> 00:46:16,926
Don't rub salt on the wound, bro
I hardly get more than 2% commission

874
00:46:17,164 --> 00:46:20,491
That corporate company is
looking for land elsewhere

875
00:46:20,524 --> 00:46:22,491
He'll very soon ask us
to return his deposit

876
00:46:22,538 --> 00:46:24,538
Don't give in to his demands, bro

877
00:46:24,593 --> 00:46:26,843
The honey bee will
definitely build its nest

878
00:46:27,032 --> 00:46:29,823
What actually matters is
who drinks the honey, huh?

879
00:46:31,653 --> 00:46:33,362
I'll call you back in a while, okay?

880
00:46:33,403 --> 00:46:34,424
Lunch is ready?

881
00:46:34,449 --> 00:46:35,538
- Sir, 1 photo
- Oh yes!

882
00:46:35,585 --> 00:46:36,877
Please click a snap of us

883
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:38,070
How are you, sir?

884
00:46:38,112 --> 00:46:39,820
I'm fine, Muruga
How are you?

885
00:46:41,112 --> 00:46:42,695
- Thank you, sir
- You're welcome

886
00:46:42,737 --> 00:46:44,726
What brings you here, Muruga?

887
00:46:44,749 --> 00:46:47,195
Director asked me to follow up
He has promised me a good role

888
00:46:47,237 --> 00:46:49,570
Congratulations!
Will you join me for lunch?

889
00:46:49,612 --> 00:46:50,820
Let us eat with him

890
00:46:50,866 --> 00:46:52,612
- We had lunch
- It's okay, come

891
00:46:52,653 --> 00:46:54,278
- No, please carry on
- Okay, see you

892
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:55,655
- Thank you, sir
- See you, bro

893
00:46:55,986 --> 00:46:57,976
Sir, Mr Ramji is your friend

894
00:46:58,015 --> 00:46:59,570
Why didn't you accept his invitation?

895
00:46:59,612 --> 00:47:02,320
One who sincerely invites won't ask
'Will you join me for lunch?'

896
00:47:02,366 --> 00:47:04,403
He'll clasp my hand and say
'Let's go and eat now'

897
00:47:04,445 --> 00:47:05,820
My father's pearl of wisdom, sir

898
00:47:05,862 --> 00:47:08,862
Don't give me all this dope
just because you have a way with words!

899
00:47:08,903 --> 00:47:10,987
You're truly a brain box
C.I.D Shankar, sir

900
00:47:11,028 --> 00:47:12,570
Missed a good meal, sir

901
00:47:13,590 --> 00:47:16,094
'Murugan, come to the hospital right now'

902
00:47:16,541 --> 00:47:17,613
Which hospital?

903
00:47:17,638 --> 00:47:18,906
'Meenakshi hospital'

904
00:47:24,382 --> 00:47:26,234
Hey! What happened?

905
00:47:26,268 --> 00:47:27,518
You're fine, right?

906
00:47:31,034 --> 00:47:32,201
Need to do an abortion

907
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:34,647
- Abortion, huh?
- Sir! You never told me

908
00:47:34,674 --> 00:47:36,585
When? You were with me all the time

909
00:47:36,632 --> 00:47:38,023
As if I'll have an eye witness!

910
00:47:38,062 --> 00:47:39,405
- Not me, sir
- Not for me either

911
00:47:39,445 --> 00:47:40,648
- Then?
- My friend

912
00:47:40,679 --> 00:47:43,859
Sir, you've climbed 1 tree and
plucked the fruits off another tree

913
00:47:43,897 --> 00:47:46,647
Don't be so vulgar, I'm not
responsible for that either, sir

914
00:47:46,882 --> 00:47:48,549
- Who is it?
- Revathy

915
00:47:49,012 --> 00:47:50,137
'Come'

916
00:47:50,362 --> 00:47:52,112
I'll call you back, di

917
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:54,645
Smooth operator!

918
00:47:54,931 --> 00:47:57,931
She and her boyfriend have
been dating from their school days

919
00:47:58,359 --> 00:47:59,866
He is in the Navy now

920
00:47:59,892 --> 00:48:01,558
They didn't meet
for a whole year

921
00:48:01,593 --> 00:48:03,260
They met last month

922
00:48:03,543 --> 00:48:05,210
She had missed him so much

923
00:48:05,236 --> 00:48:06,741
Both were a bit careless

924
00:48:06,778 --> 00:48:08,038
Ended up pregnant

925
00:48:08,088 --> 00:48:10,671
You're saying it casually like how
our phone hangs suddenly

926
00:48:10,695 --> 00:48:12,112
Will you be serious, sir?

927
00:48:12,965 --> 00:48:16,116
- Hey! Tell me
- What was I saying?

928
00:48:16,155 --> 00:48:17,530
Ended up pregnant

929
00:48:17,555 --> 00:48:18,935
'What was I saying', huh?

930
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,155
She called me and said
she wants to commit suicide

931
00:48:21,184 --> 00:48:24,226
I suggested it is simpler to go in
for an abortion and I brought her here

932
00:48:25,249 --> 00:48:29,070
Hospital is insisting on formal
approval from my parents

933
00:48:29,112 --> 00:48:30,445
Or my husband

934
00:48:30,945 --> 00:48:31,990
That's why-

935
00:48:32,015 --> 00:48:33,982
You brought your friend
who wanted to kill herself

936
00:48:34,007 --> 00:48:35,737
...so her foetus can be killed, right?

937
00:48:35,770 --> 00:48:38,218
Decent name for it
is abortion, correct?

938
00:48:43,706 --> 00:48:45,872
- What happened?
- I need time to think

939
00:48:45,921 --> 00:48:48,504
Brainwaves don't flash
in the wave of a hand, no?

940
00:48:48,984 --> 00:48:51,195
Let's go and talk to your parents

941
00:48:51,237 --> 00:48:54,945
Which parent will accept and forgive
after having stepped out of line like this?

942
00:48:54,983 --> 00:48:56,775
So you realize it is wrong?

943
00:48:56,809 --> 00:48:59,929
- Very good
- If you can help, do so

944
00:48:59,972 --> 00:49:02,681
Otherwise I'll handle it
Don't be sarcastic

945
00:49:04,010 --> 00:49:06,765
I know her parents very well, okay?

946
00:49:06,812 --> 00:49:08,405
Confirmed, they won't accept this

947
00:49:08,450 --> 00:49:10,825
Where is this 2-legged vehicle rushing to?

948
00:49:11,796 --> 00:49:14,070
Look, I don't know her parents at all

949
00:49:14,112 --> 00:49:16,403
But I can assure you 101%
they won't accept her condition

950
00:49:16,445 --> 00:49:18,718
Still we have no choice
Let us go and meet them

951
00:49:18,754 --> 00:49:20,264
Talk and try to convince them

952
00:49:20,301 --> 00:49:23,010
If they don't accept her
we can plan our next step

953
00:49:24,066 --> 00:49:25,155
What?

954
00:49:26,150 --> 00:49:27,150
Come on

955
00:49:27,796 --> 00:49:29,049
'What are you saying?'

956
00:49:29,077 --> 00:49:33,062
'I pampered you because you're my daughter
and you've brought disgrace to our family'

957
00:49:33,112 --> 00:49:35,070
Why don't you just die?

958
00:49:35,112 --> 00:49:37,695
I trusted you completely

959
00:49:37,737 --> 00:49:40,862
You made me bow my head in shame
Why didn't you elope with him then?

960
00:49:40,914 --> 00:49:43,039
- How dare you come home!
- What are you hitting her?

961
00:49:43,089 --> 00:49:45,005
I sent her to study and
she loves some riff-raff

962
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:46,737
Why hit her mercilessly like this?

963
00:49:46,778 --> 00:49:48,528
She is pregnant, I say

964
00:49:48,796 --> 00:49:50,396
Appa, let go of her

965
00:49:50,421 --> 00:49:51,948
Stop it, dear

966
00:49:52,527 --> 00:49:55,069
- Listen to us, pa
- Just follow me

967
00:49:55,290 --> 00:49:57,612
- Don't protect her
- Listen to us, pa

968
00:49:57,647 --> 00:49:59,772
Why are you behaving so inhumanly?

969
00:49:59,821 --> 00:50:01,319
What a disgrace!

970
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:02,719
Sir, come when
you're done hitting

971
00:50:02,735 --> 00:50:04,468
We are guests
waiting to talk to you

972
00:50:04,507 --> 00:50:05,799
Who are you?

973
00:50:06,099 --> 00:50:07,641
Kamalini's boyfriend, sir

974
00:50:07,805 --> 00:50:09,345
Only then he will take us seriously

975
00:50:09,387 --> 00:50:10,929
- Kamalini, what is this?
- Uncle

976
00:50:10,968 --> 00:50:13,102
Sir, why are you so short fused?

977
00:50:13,145 --> 00:50:14,437
Revathy was scared to tell you

978
00:50:14,487 --> 00:50:16,528
So she told her friend
she wants to commit suicide

979
00:50:16,570 --> 00:50:18,028
Worried her friend will die...

980
00:50:18,070 --> 00:50:20,362
Kamalini decided to kill
the foetus and so she called me

981
00:50:20,403 --> 00:50:22,954
Revathy is your heir
That baby is your lineage

982
00:50:23,001 --> 00:50:25,656
How can I decide for you?
So I sent her back to you

983
00:50:25,695 --> 00:50:27,653
But your anger got the better of you

984
00:50:27,695 --> 00:50:29,612
What else do you want me to do?

985
00:50:30,049 --> 00:50:33,382
If our child has a problem
as parents we should be accessible

986
00:50:33,408 --> 00:50:35,696
She shouldn't be scared
how her parents will react, sir

987
00:50:35,723 --> 00:50:37,155
Then there's no bond, sir

988
00:50:37,195 --> 00:50:39,653
I'm a random stranger and
she asked me to sign her abortion

989
00:50:39,695 --> 00:50:40,737
I'll teach her a lesso-

990
00:50:40,762 --> 00:50:43,679
Sir, why are you so over emotional, huh?

991
00:50:44,335 --> 00:50:47,139
Your brain can't think logically
when your emotions take over

992
00:50:47,174 --> 00:50:49,391
But I'll help you
I'll give you 2 options

993
00:50:49,430 --> 00:50:50,490
Option number 1!

994
00:50:50,515 --> 00:50:53,070
You can beat her up till 5:00 pm
or 5 weeks locking her in

995
00:50:53,112 --> 00:50:56,028
You will get her baby aborted
and find a groom of your choice

996
00:50:56,070 --> 00:50:57,454
Then what will happen?

997
00:50:57,492 --> 00:51:00,450
Your loving bond between
your daughter and you will sever

998
00:51:00,719 --> 00:51:01,772
Option number 2!

999
00:51:01,812 --> 00:51:03,524
Do a background check
on her boyfriend

1000
00:51:03,555 --> 00:51:05,028
If he's a good chap
get them married

1001
00:51:05,070 --> 00:51:06,820
You'll have a grandchild in 10 months

1002
00:51:06,862 --> 00:51:09,859
Who knows how famous
this baby will become?

1003
00:51:09,901 --> 00:51:12,567
How many people are waiting
to applaud your grandchild's feat?

1004
00:51:12,910 --> 00:51:14,952
I know what you're thinking

1005
00:51:15,727 --> 00:51:17,738
How your relatives will react, right?

1006
00:51:17,796 --> 00:51:18,921
Please ignore them

1007
00:51:18,948 --> 00:51:20,656
You'll spend your hard earned money

1008
00:51:20,695 --> 00:51:23,695
They'll find fault with your feast
after licking the banana leaf clean!

1009
00:51:23,737 --> 00:51:26,445
Can we give up our child's life
for their jealous comments?

1010
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:29,486
Sir, I know that girl
for a very short period

1011
00:51:29,528 --> 00:51:31,415
Even I realize she is good as gold

1012
00:51:31,449 --> 00:51:33,324
Imagine your feelings as her father

1013
00:51:34,528 --> 00:51:36,111
I understand your plight, sir

1014
00:51:37,361 --> 00:51:38,778
What is your name, sir?

1015
00:51:38,817 --> 00:51:39,859
Venkatesh

1016
00:51:40,061 --> 00:51:42,436
Nice meeting you, sir
Take care, sir

1017
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:43,866
Come on, let's go

1018
00:51:46,141 --> 00:51:47,719
- How can you leave?
- What now?

1019
00:51:47,766 --> 00:51:48,861
Mission accomplished

1020
00:51:48,903 --> 00:51:50,736
Their family problem
They can handle it now

1021
00:51:50,762 --> 00:51:53,594
- Why should we hover around?
- What if something drastic happens?

1022
00:51:53,632 --> 00:51:54,715
Nothing to worry

1023
00:51:54,861 --> 00:51:57,820
When I spoke for so long, he thought
for a second without losing his cool?

1024
00:51:57,861 --> 00:51:59,153
Problem was solved right then

1025
00:51:59,195 --> 00:52:00,903
Good character and anger
go hand in glove

1026
00:52:00,945 --> 00:52:04,278
Anger evaporated with those blows
His good nature surfaced, all is well

1027
00:52:13,945 --> 00:52:16,070
- How are you, akka?
- Come in

1028
00:52:16,113 --> 00:52:18,613
Go and sit there
Bhai, 2 glasses tea

1029
00:52:18,663 --> 00:52:19,746
My hand!

1030
00:52:20,861 --> 00:52:22,528
- Butter biscuit
- Bro, butter biscuits

1031
00:52:22,570 --> 00:52:23,780
- Fresh ones please
- Okay

1032
00:52:23,829 --> 00:52:25,272
Wonder what's next!

1033
00:52:26,070 --> 00:52:27,486
- Sit down
- You take a seat

1034
00:52:27,528 --> 00:52:29,195
This is my area
Please sit

1035
00:52:34,027 --> 00:52:35,194
Thanks

1036
00:52:36,046 --> 00:52:37,329
'Muruga, be brave!'

1037
00:52:37,383 --> 00:52:38,986
Muruga'nna, soooper coolers

1038
00:52:39,028 --> 00:52:40,851
- Thanks, my pet
- My pleasure, bro

1039
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:42,574
Take your coolers off please?

1040
00:52:42,624 --> 00:52:44,528
He just complimented me

1041
00:52:44,570 --> 00:52:46,653
I need to look at your eyes
and say something

1042
00:52:53,327 --> 00:52:54,410
Go on

1043
00:52:56,264 --> 00:52:58,014
What I wanted to say was-

1044
00:52:58,223 --> 00:53:00,265
Malefic effects of Saturn, huh?

1045
00:53:00,629 --> 00:53:02,546
- For 7 and ½ years
- Jinxed-mouth!

1046
00:53:02,587 --> 00:53:04,879
Ignore the ill-omen!
You continue

1047
00:53:07,195 --> 00:53:08,278
Aiyaiyo!

1048
00:53:09,438 --> 00:53:11,022
Biscuit fell into the tea

1049
00:53:11,778 --> 00:53:13,778
Why don't you blurt it out?
Don't hum and haw

1050
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:15,665
- Sorry
- Don't feel bad

1051
00:53:15,704 --> 00:53:18,407
I'll eat that bit in the end
Tell me whatever is on your mind

1052
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:22,610
Er...I didn't realize
at first when I met you

1053
00:53:22,653 --> 00:53:25,945
You, your area
Your people

1054
00:53:25,986 --> 00:53:29,445
This tea shop
Bhai the owner

1055
00:53:29,486 --> 00:53:32,611
Even this butter biscuit
I didn't realize I will like this much

1056
00:53:34,149 --> 00:53:36,403
Why should I meet you in the pub?

1057
00:53:36,445 --> 00:53:37,695
Why should I fal-

1058
00:53:39,236 --> 00:53:40,528
Fall flat for you

1059
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:41,705
Love, huh?

1060
00:53:46,149 --> 00:53:47,472
I thought as much

1061
00:53:47,499 --> 00:53:50,290
Why today of all days
my biscuit fell into the tea?!

1062
00:53:51,530 --> 00:53:53,071
The day I met you
I made up my mind

1063
00:53:53,111 --> 00:53:55,028
You should never like me
at any moment in time

1064
00:53:55,069 --> 00:53:56,625
You are up there
and I am way below

1065
00:53:56,653 --> 00:53:59,861
You don't have to climb down for my sake
I needn't climb up to your level either

1066
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:01,516
It will take time
and I'll get tired

1067
00:54:01,546 --> 00:54:03,087
Let me repeat the same dialog

1068
00:54:03,111 --> 00:54:05,486
Our brain won't think logically
when our emotions take over

1069
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,228
- No-
- I'll help you

1070
00:54:07,641 --> 00:54:08,736
I'll give you 2 options

1071
00:54:08,778 --> 00:54:11,445
Option number 1, we can be in love
and roam around park, beach, theaters

1072
00:54:11,486 --> 00:54:13,594
Even our montage song will be cool, okay?

1073
00:54:13,629 --> 00:54:16,023
You'll get me branded shirts
and we'll go on long car rides

1074
00:54:16,070 --> 00:54:18,320
Your father's BP will shoot up
seeing us together

1075
00:54:18,361 --> 00:54:19,861
Will I be able to face him?

1076
00:54:20,279 --> 00:54:22,487
No, I can't because I have
a family to take care

1077
00:54:22,523 --> 00:54:24,606
My ambition plus my people
who depend on me

1078
00:54:24,871 --> 00:54:26,079
Then option number 2!

1079
00:54:26,195 --> 00:54:28,153
We meet on the road
10 years later, serendipity

1080
00:54:28,195 --> 00:54:30,736
I introduce my wife and you say
'This is my husband'

1081
00:54:30,819 --> 00:54:34,194
But instead if you dare call me 'bro'

1082
00:54:36,788 --> 00:54:38,788
Girl, I swear you've had it!

1083
00:54:40,618 --> 00:54:42,403
I somehow think
option #2 will work out

1084
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:43,736
Give it a thought

1085
00:54:44,306 --> 00:54:46,485
I think your tea is cold
Shall I order a fresh glass?

1086
00:54:46,523 --> 00:54:48,148
- Bhai, 1 glass-
- No need, anna

1087
00:54:49,558 --> 00:54:51,141
I'll go home and drink, bro

1088
00:54:51,855 --> 00:54:52,938
You called me 'anna'?

1089
00:54:52,958 --> 00:54:54,041
See you, bro?

1090
00:54:55,254 --> 00:54:56,337
Thanks, 'na

1091
00:54:59,947 --> 00:55:01,364
So soon, huh?

1092
00:55:02,811 --> 00:55:04,477
Fast as lightning!

1093
00:55:05,805 --> 00:55:07,926
Bhai, give me your new biscuit

1094
00:55:07,968 --> 00:55:09,718
- This packet?
- Yes, that one

1095
00:55:17,403 --> 00:55:19,028
[snoring]

1096
00:55:20,103 --> 00:55:22,602
Bro, how are you?

1097
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:24,790
- You, huh?
- 'Sleeping, bro?'

1098
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:26,195
What do you want now?

1099
00:55:26,236 --> 00:55:28,611
Making sure others don't sleep

1100
00:55:28,652 --> 00:55:31,360
I wanted to know
if you were sleeping soundly

1101
00:55:31,403 --> 00:55:35,570
A girl came of her own accord
and professed her love to you

1102
00:55:35,611 --> 00:55:36,820
'What should you do?'

1103
00:55:36,861 --> 00:55:38,361
Accept your feelings for her too

1104
00:55:38,403 --> 00:55:40,611
'Or deny it'

1105
00:55:40,759 --> 00:55:43,290
Instead you're doling out advice

1106
00:55:43,329 --> 00:55:44,454
Giving me options

1107
00:55:44,486 --> 00:55:46,236
'What do you think of yourself, huh?'

1108
00:55:46,262 --> 00:55:48,493
Listen, if I see you face to face-

1109
00:55:49,754 --> 00:55:52,720
In my area, a girl called Kamala

1110
00:55:52,778 --> 00:55:55,962
'...fell in love with one fellow
When he denied his feelings for her'

1111
00:55:56,009 --> 00:55:58,528
...she tortured him
to the worst possible extent

1112
00:55:58,570 --> 00:56:02,634
Unable to cope, imagine
if he surrendered to her!

1113
00:56:02,676 --> 00:56:04,051
Are you fully tanked?

1114
00:56:04,093 --> 00:56:07,426
Don't even for a minute think
I drank because of love failure

1115
00:56:07,978 --> 00:56:12,681
I am drinking with full confidence
my love will succeed, huh?

1116
00:56:13,859 --> 00:56:15,403
You have the gall to give me options!

1117
00:56:15,445 --> 00:56:19,361
'Listen now to my options for you
Either you profess your love to me'

1118
00:56:19,558 --> 00:56:22,725
I'll respond likewise
and we can have a gala time

1119
00:56:23,032 --> 00:56:27,101
Or else shut up and hang around
with me like we usually do

1120
00:56:27,152 --> 00:56:30,360
'Let it be 6 months or 1 year
Whenever love blooms, let it blossom'

1121
00:56:30,402 --> 00:56:33,069
Till then let it be my one-sided love

1122
00:56:33,696 --> 00:56:35,625
I'm fully sloshed

1123
00:56:35,653 --> 00:56:38,361
'I intend having a 'rock & roll'
session with you'

1124
00:56:38,688 --> 00:56:39,952
I've got 2 left feet

1125
00:56:40,027 --> 00:56:42,194
Try to stop me if you can, da

1126
00:56:42,235 --> 00:56:44,487
I said I've got 2 left feet,
you drunken female!

1127
00:56:44,522 --> 00:56:47,281
Jujujuju...go to bed, baby

1128
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,486
Baby, huh?

1129
00:56:50,016 --> 00:56:52,808
"Ruling king"

1130
00:56:53,195 --> 00:56:58,236
"Ruling king pulling heartstrings"

1131
00:57:00,195 --> 00:57:05,153
"Look what glad tidings
the future brings"

1132
00:57:07,914 --> 00:57:11,187
"Kamala is a girl so stylish
She is yours to relish"

1133
00:57:11,212 --> 00:57:14,325
"Aiyaiyo! She's a live wire
Kamala your heart's desire"

1134
00:57:14,408 --> 00:57:17,908
"Kamala is a glam doll snazzy
She is all yours, joyous and jazzy"

1135
00:57:17,955 --> 00:57:21,454
"Aiyaiyo! She's a holy terror
Kamala your heart's tremor"

1136
00:57:34,426 --> 00:57:37,592
"Kamala, o' so classy
My glam-doll; lovely lassie"

1137
00:57:37,658 --> 00:57:40,813
"Without giving us a green signal
you stand tight lipped, hey girl!"

1138
00:57:40,866 --> 00:57:44,283
"Kamala, o' so snazzy
My Miss World; lovely lassie"

1139
00:57:44,325 --> 00:57:47,741
"Without nodding your head
you stand there lips zipped"

1140
00:57:47,783 --> 00:57:50,950
"Hiccups overlap
Maybe a booby trap"

1141
00:57:50,991 --> 00:57:54,116
"If you inch any closer to me
my heart goes bumptey-bump, baby"

1142
00:57:54,158 --> 00:57:57,533
"My status is single
I'm ready to mingle"

1143
00:57:57,575 --> 00:58:00,908
"If love breezes in with a chime
attend to your duty full time"

1144
00:58:00,931 --> 00:58:07,348
"Kamala, my flower, my love
Kamala, my lotus from above"

1145
00:58:07,658 --> 00:58:10,866
"Kamala, o' so classy
My glam-doll; lovely lassie"

1146
00:58:10,908 --> 00:58:14,158
"Without giving us a green signal
you stand tight lipped, hey girl!"

1147
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:17,241
"Kamala, o' so snazzy
My Miss World; lovely lassie"

1148
00:58:17,283 --> 00:58:20,200
"Without nodding your head
you stand there lips zipped"

1149
00:58:20,241 --> 00:58:23,325
"Is your heart kindled by fiery desire?"

1150
00:58:23,407 --> 00:58:26,783
"Via a current wire
her eyes electrify fire"

1151
00:58:26,825 --> 00:58:29,991
"Is your heart sparked by red-hot desire?"

1152
00:58:30,059 --> 00:58:33,528
"Via a current wire
her eyes inflame fire"

1153
00:58:44,154 --> 00:58:45,711
Don't hit my navel!

1154
00:58:49,248 --> 00:58:50,746
- Okay, huh?
- Okay!

1155
00:58:50,771 --> 00:58:53,583
"Ruling king"

1156
00:58:56,950 --> 00:59:00,575
"Ruling king pulling heartstrings"

1157
00:59:00,616 --> 00:59:07,283
"Like a myna clinging to a current cable
you made my heart flutter so vulnerable"

1158
00:59:10,158 --> 00:59:16,571
"Firing a love-rocket on a single daredevil
you made my mind go bonkers and yell"

1159
00:59:16,610 --> 00:59:19,616
"I'm iMac apple
You're high volts, pal"

1160
00:59:19,658 --> 00:59:22,908
"Don't power me up inside
Don't take my heart on a terror-ride"

1161
00:59:22,950 --> 00:59:30,235
"You play games with your iBall gizmo
Fireworks flare up in my brain as dynamo"

1162
00:59:30,325 --> 00:59:33,450
"Kamala is a girl so stylish
She is yours to relish"

1163
00:59:33,491 --> 00:59:36,991
"Aiyaiyo! She's a live wire
Kamala your heart's desire"

1164
00:59:37,033 --> 00:59:40,200
"Kamala is a glam doll snazzy
She is all yours, joyous and jazzy"

1165
00:59:40,241 --> 00:59:43,533
"Aiyaiyo! She's a holy terror
Kamala your heart's tremor"

1166
00:59:43,575 --> 00:59:46,908
"Kamala, o' so classy
My glam-doll; lovely lassie"

1167
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:50,241
"Without giving us a green signal
you stand tight lipped, hey girl!"

1168
00:59:50,325 --> 00:59:53,491
"Kamala, o' so snazzy
My Miss Universe; pretty posy"

1169
00:59:53,533 --> 00:59:56,158
"Without nodding your head
you stand there lips zipped"

1170
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:59,408
"Is your heart kindled by fiery desire?"

1171
00:59:59,450 --> 01:00:02,700
"Via a current wire
her eyes electrify fire"

1172
01:00:02,741 --> 01:00:06,033
"Is your heart sparked by red-hot desire?"

1173
01:00:06,116 --> 01:00:09,825
"Via a current wire
her eyes magnetize fire"

1174
01:00:09,907 --> 01:00:12,990
"Ruling king"

1175
01:00:13,158 --> 01:00:18,658
"Ruling king pulling her heartstring"

1176
01:00:20,241 --> 01:00:26,700
"Look what glad tidings
the future brings"

1177
01:00:39,885 --> 01:00:43,329
"Kamala, the lotus-eyed one
Kamala, forever full of fun"

1178
01:00:56,170 --> 01:00:57,410
Yes!

1179
01:01:03,829 --> 01:01:05,582
Vanakkam, sir

1180
01:01:05,619 --> 01:01:06,911
Please take a seat

1181
01:01:09,911 --> 01:01:13,489
How much is the current rate
per acre near Krishnagiri, sir?

1182
01:01:13,536 --> 01:01:14,551
Krishnagiri, huh?

1183
01:01:14,576 --> 01:01:17,155
Sir, I know the agent
you're dealing with over there

1184
01:01:17,192 --> 01:01:18,575
We have our informers

1185
01:01:18,606 --> 01:01:20,439
Yes, I don't deny it

1186
01:01:20,653 --> 01:01:25,036
So are you saying you won't be
building your factory in my town?

1187
01:01:25,078 --> 01:01:26,703
What can we do, sir?

1188
01:01:26,861 --> 01:01:29,445
We've waited long enough

1189
01:01:29,703 --> 01:01:32,369
Your townsfolk are not being cooperative

1190
01:01:32,411 --> 01:01:35,950
You've lost your MLA clout
On what basis do you want us to wait?

1191
01:01:35,983 --> 01:01:38,399
True, I lost my political post

1192
01:01:39,332 --> 01:01:42,457
But do you remember
who is responsible for it?

1193
01:01:43,328 --> 01:01:46,453
I got into the bad books
of my Party higher ups

1194
01:01:46,494 --> 01:01:48,369
Bad name with the people too

1195
01:01:48,619 --> 01:01:50,621
Having lost my political clout

1196
01:01:50,645 --> 01:01:54,536
I've been working for your factory
to be set up in my town

1197
01:01:54,703 --> 01:01:56,453
It is just a matter of time

1198
01:01:56,494 --> 01:01:58,328
'I will definitely win this election'

1199
01:01:58,369 --> 01:01:59,703
'Why are you glaring at me?'

1200
01:01:59,744 --> 01:02:05,192
Govt supply of groceries,
electricity, water supply, road

1201
01:02:05,236 --> 01:02:07,236
I've disconnected
all these for my people

1202
01:02:07,286 --> 01:02:09,286
They will automatically come to me

1203
01:02:09,328 --> 01:02:11,849
Only with the below poverty line

1204
01:02:11,874 --> 01:02:15,203
...we can ask and get what we want

1205
01:02:15,616 --> 01:02:18,597
Sir, I'm a business man

1206
01:02:18,831 --> 01:02:20,706
But I'm a politician

1207
01:02:21,661 --> 01:02:24,119
My ideas are on a different plane

1208
01:02:24,161 --> 01:02:26,684
You are trapped in a lion's den

1209
01:02:26,733 --> 01:02:31,358
Hereafter the lion decides
whether to release you or not

1210
01:02:31,894 --> 01:02:33,003
Let's wait and see

1211
01:02:33,046 --> 01:02:34,254
We'll see

1212
01:02:37,473 --> 01:02:38,890
He doesn't know

1213
01:02:40,429 --> 01:02:42,179
...who the lion is!

1214
01:02:44,033 --> 01:02:45,869
I don't believe he will
come over to our side

1215
01:02:45,911 --> 01:02:47,536
He has no other choice

1216
01:02:47,953 --> 01:02:49,582
He has to depend on us

1217
01:02:59,328 --> 01:03:02,027
Bro, this is the chap
chasing our madam

1218
01:03:02,453 --> 01:03:03,661
- Hello
- 'Where are you?'

1219
01:03:03,703 --> 01:03:04,828
Movie is about to start

1220
01:03:04,869 --> 01:03:06,411
At the signal, give me 10 minutes

1221
01:03:06,457 --> 01:03:07,499
'Don't lie'

1222
01:03:08,828 --> 01:03:09,953
Hello

1223
01:03:11,379 --> 01:03:13,962
Just say 'I'm at the signal
I'll be at the theater in 10 minutes'

1224
01:03:13,994 --> 01:03:15,286
She isn't believing me

1225
01:03:15,328 --> 01:03:16,369
'He is at the signal'

1226
01:03:16,411 --> 01:03:18,328
'In 10 minutes he'll be
at Woodlands theatre'

1227
01:03:18,369 --> 01:03:19,536
Thanks
Satisfied?

1228
01:03:19,567 --> 01:03:21,859
Okay, make it fast
I don't want to miss the 1st scene

1229
01:03:30,301 --> 01:03:31,762
Hey! 1 minute

1230
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:34,566
'If you are man enough
come out, I say'

1231
01:03:34,591 --> 01:03:35,987
'TN 10 AV 8049'

1232
01:03:36,012 --> 01:03:38,179
That's my bike in the parking lot

1233
01:03:38,747 --> 01:03:41,685
Hey! Who is this
screening such a note?

1234
01:03:41,726 --> 01:03:43,559
Brother, show me your face please

1235
01:03:44,910 --> 01:03:47,668
You are a man for sure
but that's my bike, sit down

1236
01:03:48,244 --> 01:03:49,966
- I'll go and check?
- I'll come too

1237
01:03:49,992 --> 01:03:51,700
You sit, I'll be back

1238
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:53,460
Leave some for me, okay?

1239
01:04:06,786 --> 01:04:07,869
'He is at the signal'

1240
01:04:07,911 --> 01:04:10,286
'In 10 minutes he'll be
at Woodlands theatre'

1241
01:04:25,161 --> 01:04:26,328
Who are they?

1242
01:04:26,693 --> 01:04:29,379
They called me out and
now they are running away

1243
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:32,591
They got scared of me, not you

1244
01:04:32,615 --> 01:04:33,655
They are my dad's men

1245
01:04:33,681 --> 01:04:35,848
Is your father Baashhaa of Bombay?

1246
01:04:36,203 --> 01:04:39,036
I have to call and tell my dad
before they go and report to him

1247
01:04:39,078 --> 01:04:40,828
- He's your father, right?
- Yes

1248
01:04:40,861 --> 01:04:42,611
Why such a serious tone?

1249
01:04:42,981 --> 01:04:44,064
Call him

1250
01:04:45,447 --> 01:04:46,781
- 'Hello, appa
- Where are you?'

1251
01:04:46,828 --> 01:04:47,833
Theater

1252
01:04:47,872 --> 01:04:49,955
Didn't I tell you
not to step out?

1253
01:04:50,247 --> 01:04:51,271
'Idiot!'

1254
01:04:51,312 --> 01:04:52,687
You go to your home now

1255
01:04:54,186 --> 01:04:55,269
'Murugaaa!'

1256
01:04:56,913 --> 01:04:57,913
'Let go of me'

1257
01:04:58,700 --> 01:04:59,950
'Let me go'

1258
01:05:03,892 --> 01:05:05,060
Let me go

1259
01:05:05,085 --> 01:05:06,210
Let go of me

1260
01:05:06,610 --> 01:05:07,902
Muruga!

1261
01:05:24,699 --> 01:05:28,878
"Look at him, the spark in his eyes
He's dynamite; a real prize"

1262
01:05:29,387 --> 01:05:31,845
Looks like you're in Chennai now

1263
01:05:32,636 --> 01:05:35,226
Hey! If anything untoward
happens to my daughter-

1264
01:05:35,267 --> 01:05:36,642
Nothing will happen

1265
01:05:37,119 --> 01:05:39,997
I would like you to be present
to witness whatever happens

1266
01:05:40,036 --> 01:05:42,578
I've shared the location with you
Come as soon as you can

1267
01:05:42,618 --> 01:05:43,785
'I'll be waiting'

1268
01:05:47,204 --> 01:05:50,917
Whether you like me or not
you've got no choice but to marry me

1269
01:05:50,996 --> 01:05:52,621
And there's no change in that

1270
01:05:53,478 --> 01:05:54,603
Are you very confident?

1271
01:05:54,645 --> 01:05:56,895
- I'll hit-
- Do you have full faith?

1272
01:05:57,071 --> 01:05:58,488
What's that stare in aid of?

1273
01:05:59,345 --> 01:06:01,864
Half an hour ago
if you had kidnapped me

1274
01:06:02,060 --> 01:06:04,344
...you would've kidnapped
only Sanjay Yadav's daughter

1275
01:06:04,369 --> 01:06:05,536
You made a mistake

1276
01:06:06,231 --> 01:06:10,550
You kidnapped me right in front of
the man I love with all my heart

1277
01:06:10,593 --> 01:06:14,718
Didn't you see his eyes when you hit me
and shoved me into the car?

1278
01:06:15,460 --> 01:06:18,730
I saw the blind fury in his eyes

1279
01:06:19,828 --> 01:06:22,744
Wondering about your fate
under that rage of fury

1280
01:06:22,786 --> 01:06:24,286
...scares the hell out of me!

1281
01:06:25,288 --> 01:06:28,371
Better if you leave me right here

1282
01:06:28,661 --> 01:06:30,021
For your own good

1283
01:06:30,062 --> 01:06:31,500
Hey! Are you threatening me?

1284
01:06:31,539 --> 01:06:35,203
Chee chee! You shared
this location only with my dad?

1285
01:06:35,228 --> 01:06:36,770
I shared the same with him

1286
01:07:04,161 --> 01:07:05,732
I swear on everything sacred

1287
01:07:05,765 --> 01:07:09,390
Until 10 minutes ago that girl and I
shared only a decent bond of friendship

1288
01:07:09,551 --> 01:07:12,259
But the moment you hit her
in front of me

1289
01:07:12,353 --> 01:07:16,167
Imagine, that fury within me
is refusing to simmer down!

1290
01:07:16,983 --> 01:07:19,399
Only then I realized
how much I love her

1291
01:07:20,150 --> 01:07:21,525
Seriously

1292
01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:24,494
'Sorry, we kidnapped madam unknowingly'

1293
01:07:24,536 --> 01:07:26,661
I don't want any of you
to come and say this

1294
01:07:26,700 --> 01:07:28,796
I'm not in a mood
to forgive any of you

1295
01:07:28,829 --> 01:07:31,038
If you have any idea like that

1296
01:07:31,964 --> 01:07:33,956
...kindly delete, okay?

1297
01:07:35,136 --> 01:07:39,777
My anger will abate only when
I bash you up in front of her eyes

1298
01:07:39,828 --> 01:07:42,119
That's my 1st gift to her

1299
01:07:43,250 --> 01:07:44,625
Okay, baby?

1300
01:08:17,817 --> 01:08:19,308
Trying to make trouble?

1301
01:08:20,438 --> 01:08:21,563
'Murugan'

1302
01:10:20,868 --> 01:10:23,940
Leave now
Right away

1303
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:32,446
'Sir...?'

1304
01:10:32,494 --> 01:10:35,161
Who said his name is 'Murugan'?

1305
01:10:35,220 --> 01:10:37,262
His name is Thamizh!

1306
01:10:40,470 --> 01:10:41,720
Move...!

1307
01:10:46,119 --> 01:10:47,119
MOVE!

1308
01:11:00,915 --> 01:11:02,469
Murugan

1309
01:11:03,058 --> 01:11:05,725
Murugan who is in love
with my daughter

1310
01:11:06,722 --> 01:11:08,764
Who is he?
What does he do?

1311
01:11:09,050 --> 01:11:10,592
Where does he live?

1312
01:11:10,745 --> 01:11:12,412
I need all these details

1313
01:11:12,478 --> 01:11:14,019
I have to meet him

1314
01:11:14,722 --> 01:11:15,847
Yes, sir

1315
01:11:16,915 --> 01:11:19,811
'Do not chop down trees
Do not fell them please'

1316
01:11:19,837 --> 01:11:22,610
'Persevere to preserve
Trees we will conserve'

1317
01:11:22,642 --> 01:11:24,436
'Few Months Ago'

1318
01:11:24,478 --> 01:11:28,086
'Do not destroy nature
We will protect trees forever'

1319
01:11:28,101 --> 01:11:30,563
'Do not chop trees down
Do not fell them to the ground'

1320
01:11:30,603 --> 01:11:32,436
[slogan shouting continues]

1321
01:11:32,478 --> 01:11:34,243
You are all girls gathered here

1322
01:11:34,292 --> 01:11:38,055
If the problem magnifies and you get hurt
you have to take your exams tomorrow

1323
01:11:38,399 --> 01:11:39,618
Won't you find it tough?

1324
01:11:39,650 --> 01:11:40,734
Go home now

1325
01:11:40,767 --> 01:11:42,110
We appreciate your concern

1326
01:11:42,142 --> 01:11:43,561
We can take care
You carry on

1327
01:11:43,603 --> 01:11:46,571
After all you're a female!
What temerity, huh?

1328
01:11:46,599 --> 01:11:50,469
If a girl is protesting so bold and brave
and raising her voice, shouldn't you know?

1329
01:11:50,516 --> 01:11:52,144
There is a man behind me!

1330
01:11:52,185 --> 01:11:54,219
Who is that man?
Call him here

1331
01:12:32,237 --> 01:12:34,446
- What is the issue, darling?
- Listen, dear

1332
01:12:35,181 --> 01:12:38,735
They are planning to chop this tree
which is an obstruction to this shop

1333
01:12:38,769 --> 01:12:40,769
How many generations
it would have witnessed

1334
01:12:40,811 --> 01:12:43,360
If they want to chop it so coolly
how can we accept it?

1335
01:12:43,394 --> 01:12:44,517
Understood

1336
01:12:44,542 --> 01:12:48,042
You'll bring the roof down even if
a plant is uprooted, imagine a tree then

1337
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:50,220
Who is that monkey, dear?

1338
01:12:50,251 --> 01:12:53,462
"Hey there! Move, dude
I will rip your ears into two"

1339
01:12:53,509 --> 01:12:56,923
"Who came spoiling for a fight?
I'm king of blows; to wrong the right"

1340
01:13:01,224 --> 01:13:02,413
This chap?

1341
01:13:05,998 --> 01:13:07,415
Where are you off to?

1342
01:13:19,528 --> 01:13:21,865
"Move aside, hey you!
Your face will be minus ears 2"

1343
01:13:21,913 --> 01:13:25,069
"Who wanted to pick a fight?
I have come to wrong the right"

1344
01:13:25,124 --> 01:13:26,819
"Eruptive
Explosive"

1345
01:13:26,844 --> 01:13:29,467
"Even fear will flee; terrified
with a glimpse of him, petrified"

1346
01:13:38,552 --> 01:13:40,517
- Oh gawd!
- Wait

1347
01:13:40,542 --> 01:13:42,542
- Isn't it this buffalo, dear?
- Yes

1348
01:14:18,456 --> 01:14:20,581
He is sitting in cool comfort, that's why

1349
01:14:20,613 --> 01:14:24,176
Land, trees, air is for everyone
You have the right only to enjoy nature

1350
01:14:24,201 --> 01:14:25,824
You have money to
buy an air-conditioner

1351
01:14:25,849 --> 01:14:28,395
For those who can't afford
trees supplement as air conditioners

1352
01:14:28,427 --> 01:14:31,495
Only because of chopping trees
we are already buying water

1353
01:14:31,537 --> 01:14:33,552
- Moron!
- Don't you watch the News on TV?

1354
01:14:33,603 --> 01:14:35,936
People waiting for hours
for water, carrying pots?

1355
01:14:35,978 --> 01:14:38,436
Even after watching it
won't people like you change?

1356
01:14:38,636 --> 01:14:40,732
If humans get angry
they will resort to only blows

1357
01:14:40,765 --> 01:14:43,731
But if Mother Nature gets furious
she will wipe out everything!

1358
01:14:44,245 --> 01:14:47,333
Let's preserve the existing trees and
save them for our next generation

1359
01:14:47,386 --> 01:14:48,811
Stop felling trees

1360
01:14:48,853 --> 01:14:51,353
If you do, she will protest
If she opposes, I have to show up

1361
01:14:51,394 --> 01:14:53,159
But sir is very busy
Do you get it?

1362
01:14:55,162 --> 01:14:56,745
He has reformed, darling

1363
01:14:57,250 --> 01:14:59,541
You had better grow few plants
in front of your shop

1364
01:15:00,029 --> 01:15:01,821
- Come, my dear
- Okay

1365
01:15:15,664 --> 01:15:17,628
Sister-in-law, Thamizh isn't here as yet?

1366
01:15:17,674 --> 01:15:20,316
He went to bring Thenmozhi
He'll be here any minute

1367
01:15:24,766 --> 01:15:25,932
Hello, Thamizh

1368
01:15:25,973 --> 01:15:27,080
Welcome, Thamizh

1369
01:15:46,805 --> 01:15:49,878
Let's make this festival
the most memorable one

1370
01:15:49,936 --> 01:15:51,378
I must tell you this also

1371
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:55,548
Kuzhandhaivel has got
the MLA seat once again

1372
01:15:56,097 --> 01:15:58,087
We must unite and make him win

1373
01:15:58,111 --> 01:15:59,776
How can we dispute your words, sir?

1374
01:15:59,817 --> 01:16:01,738
We'll always be 2 steps behind you

1375
01:16:01,763 --> 01:16:03,012
What do you say?

1376
01:16:03,060 --> 01:16:04,393
- Yes
- Of course

1377
01:16:12,811 --> 01:16:20,327
"I am as happy as can be
Nothing else is necessary"

1378
01:16:24,519 --> 01:16:29,498
"My home sweet home and hometown
charming and cheerful all around"

1379
01:16:29,548 --> 01:16:34,459
"No comparison to the love I'm bound"

1380
01:16:34,606 --> 01:16:39,576
"Seas can run dry if that's possible
Mountains can even tilt or topple"

1381
01:16:39,663 --> 01:16:44,474
"But true love will never wane, impossible"

1382
01:16:44,522 --> 01:16:47,814
"What else is necessary?"

1383
01:16:49,518 --> 01:16:53,143
"I lead a life most satisfactory"

1384
01:16:54,526 --> 01:16:57,870
"What else do I need, tell me?"

1385
01:17:07,189 --> 01:17:12,087
"What else is basic necessity?"

1386
01:17:12,231 --> 01:17:17,152
"This life is heaven on earth in totality"

1387
01:17:57,936 --> 01:18:01,717
"Every day is a festival gregarious"

1388
01:18:02,978 --> 01:18:07,004
"Like golden drops of honey nectarous"

1389
01:18:08,019 --> 01:18:12,216
"Shoulder to lean on as bonds bloom"

1390
01:18:13,014 --> 01:18:17,186
"Dreams feathered by a peacock plume"

1391
01:18:17,228 --> 01:18:22,353
"Even if this world opposes vehemently
a brave heart that defends diligently"

1392
01:18:22,394 --> 01:18:28,186
"This family has a proud lineage steadily
to sacrifice their own life so speedily"

1393
01:18:28,323 --> 01:18:33,157
"When you walk by
with your hawk-eye"

1394
01:18:33,269 --> 01:18:38,311
"Even eyes that don't notice
will immediately realize"

1395
01:18:38,353 --> 01:18:43,370
"Whatever you say is our oracle"

1396
01:18:43,439 --> 01:18:48,064
"Sir, we consider your word as gospel"

1397
01:18:48,334 --> 01:18:51,706
"We are on cloud nine
What else do we need divine?"

1398
01:19:00,968 --> 01:19:04,934
"Your family is known for its generosity"

1399
01:19:05,836 --> 01:19:10,008
"Like father like son you see
He is our aiya's progeny"

1400
01:19:11,061 --> 01:19:15,646
"What else is compulsory?"

1401
01:19:16,014 --> 01:19:20,998
"I lead a life most satisfactory"

1402
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:28,642
Please come in

1403
01:19:28,686 --> 01:19:30,394
- Hello, how are you?
- Very good, bro

1404
01:19:30,436 --> 01:19:32,019
Please sit

1405
01:19:32,478 --> 01:19:34,061
You found your way here only now!

1406
01:19:34,103 --> 01:19:36,767
Ma, with whose permission
are they here to see me as a bride?

1407
01:19:36,792 --> 01:19:38,605
They just wanted to see you informally

1408
01:19:38,652 --> 01:19:40,152
Tomorrow isn't your wedding!

1409
01:19:40,194 --> 01:19:43,194
Because they are appa's relatives
don't act smart, I'll poison the coffee

1410
01:19:43,232 --> 01:19:45,004
Anyhow you'll eventually get married

1411
01:19:45,047 --> 01:19:46,380
- Why be so rude?
- Let go, aunt

1412
01:19:46,404 --> 01:19:47,795
This groom lives in London

1413
01:19:47,845 --> 01:19:50,198
You can happily sightsee
whole of London, right?

1414
01:19:50,228 --> 01:19:52,811
Manju, will you divorce your husband
and marry this London chap?

1415
01:19:52,853 --> 01:19:55,552
- I can go and suggest
- Your tongue is your worst enemy!

1416
01:19:55,596 --> 01:19:57,185
- 'Rajeswari'
- Your daughter, no?

1417
01:19:57,534 --> 01:19:59,191
Please bring Thenmozhi, dear

1418
01:19:59,441 --> 01:20:01,103
Don't make me talk unnecessarily, ma

1419
01:20:01,144 --> 01:20:02,394
- I don't want this
- Listen

1420
01:20:02,436 --> 01:20:04,144
'Thenmozhi is so grown up now'

1421
01:20:04,186 --> 01:20:06,414
- 'We saw her when she was young
- Yes'

1422
01:20:06,454 --> 01:20:09,079
- 'How are you, dear?
- How are you all doing?'

1423
01:20:09,121 --> 01:20:10,954
- We are fine
- Doing good

1424
01:20:11,022 --> 01:20:12,605
Okay, bro, we will take leave

1425
01:20:12,639 --> 01:20:14,514
Why leave so soon?
You can have lunch with us

1426
01:20:14,538 --> 01:20:16,121
We'll come another day, bro

1427
01:20:16,163 --> 01:20:18,288
- Why don't you eat?
- When we come with our son

1428
01:20:18,329 --> 01:20:20,413
- We'll take leave now
- Thank you, take care

1429
01:20:20,454 --> 01:20:22,829
I can't get married to a stranger
and live somewhere else

1430
01:20:22,871 --> 01:20:24,913
At least one of you try
to understand my feelings

1431
01:20:24,954 --> 01:20:27,621
- Thenu, this groom lives abroad
- That's why, dear

1432
01:20:27,663 --> 01:20:29,680
My uncle Thamizh also worked in Dubai

1433
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:32,621
Didn't he come back for us
because he was so homesick?

1434
01:20:32,663 --> 01:20:35,538
Thenu, stop beating around the bush

1435
01:20:35,596 --> 01:20:38,782
Why don't you be frank and say
'I'll marry only Thamizh'?

1436
01:20:38,807 --> 01:20:40,111
Is it so, my dear?

1437
01:20:40,157 --> 01:20:43,519
The entire town's gossip is
I'll become your daughter-in-law

1438
01:20:43,561 --> 01:20:46,094
But you and aunt have never
felt that way even once, right?

1439
01:20:46,121 --> 01:20:48,371
Aunt, Thenmozhi is very talkative

1440
01:20:48,413 --> 01:20:51,288
You think I won't be
able to adjust here, right?

1441
01:20:51,375 --> 01:20:52,667
Hey...!

1442
01:20:53,251 --> 01:20:55,121
This family is my breath

1443
01:20:55,163 --> 01:20:57,329
All of you please
understand how I feel

1444
01:20:59,887 --> 01:21:02,721
- Don't cry
- Looks like you are going out somewhere

1445
01:21:02,762 --> 01:21:03,778
Thamizh

1446
01:21:03,808 --> 01:21:06,642
She says if she has to get married
she will marry only you

1447
01:21:06,684 --> 01:21:08,653
Did you say so, Thenu?

1448
01:21:09,058 --> 01:21:12,012
From childhood we've played together,
made fun and teased each other

1449
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:14,498
How can you assume
I'll marry you because of that?

1450
01:21:16,176 --> 01:21:18,900
I don't know if you will marry me or not

1451
01:21:18,929 --> 01:21:21,012
But I know you like me a lot

1452
01:21:21,054 --> 01:21:23,221
I believe you won't reject me

1453
01:21:27,403 --> 01:21:29,488
- Uncle, where is the groom from?
- Our town only

1454
01:21:29,512 --> 01:21:30,762
But he lives in London now

1455
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:32,384
London bridegroom is it?

1456
01:21:33,179 --> 01:21:34,363
Father

1457
01:21:34,512 --> 01:21:35,554
Say 'no', pa

1458
01:21:35,596 --> 01:21:37,762
Why are mother and daughter conspiring?

1459
01:21:37,811 --> 01:21:39,353
- Wait
- Uncle...uncle

1460
01:21:39,442 --> 01:21:41,192
Why are you jumping to conclusions?

1461
01:21:41,223 --> 01:21:42,721
- Father
- Tell me

1462
01:21:42,762 --> 01:21:46,762
She is the bride of our house, our gem,
jewel in our crown, she belongs only to us

1463
01:21:46,804 --> 01:21:49,096
Tell them we don't fix
any alliance outside our family

1464
01:21:49,148 --> 01:21:51,692
- You're such a minx, son
- Are you happy now?

1465
01:21:51,729 --> 01:21:53,437
Now you must blush, dear

1466
01:21:54,228 --> 01:21:55,471
Am I not right?

1467
01:21:55,512 --> 01:21:56,804
Hit him

1468
01:21:56,846 --> 01:21:58,429
Beating me before we get married?

1469
01:21:58,471 --> 01:22:00,096
I don't want her
She's all yours

1470
01:22:00,137 --> 01:22:01,387
Wait, dear

1471
01:22:01,512 --> 01:22:04,212
- Screw you!
- She wants me even before we get married

1472
01:22:04,230 --> 01:22:05,597
Enough of all this banter

1473
01:22:05,635 --> 01:22:08,760
We can fix an auspicious day
after the festival and get you both married

1474
01:22:08,795 --> 01:22:10,055
'Agreed?'

1475
01:22:14,603 --> 01:22:16,978
Hello, sir
Please come here

1476
01:22:17,179 --> 01:22:18,387
Speak in Hindi

1477
01:22:18,432 --> 01:22:19,657
Anyone knows Tamil?

1478
01:22:19,689 --> 01:22:21,322
- What, madam?
- What is happening here?

1479
01:22:21,351 --> 01:22:24,072
We are preparing this ground
for a copper factory to be built here

1480
01:22:24,103 --> 01:22:25,523
Copper factory?

1481
01:22:25,565 --> 01:22:28,731
People in our town own this land
How can a factory be built here?

1482
01:22:28,756 --> 01:22:29,977
'What are you saying?'

1483
01:22:30,005 --> 01:22:32,692
'From our forefathers' time
this has been agricultural land'

1484
01:22:32,739 --> 01:22:35,028
'You tricked us by making us
part with our documen-'

1485
01:22:35,168 --> 01:22:36,846
- Yes, sir
- What happened?

1486
01:22:36,887 --> 01:22:39,923
People of this town are objecting
to a factory being constructed here

1487
01:22:39,954 --> 01:22:42,370
- Has the property been registered?
- Yes, sir

1488
01:22:43,629 --> 01:22:46,095
Then toss the legal document
on to their faces!

1489
01:22:46,139 --> 01:22:48,009
'This is our Marimuthu bro's land'

1490
01:22:48,054 --> 01:22:49,346
Kumaresan anna's land

1491
01:22:49,387 --> 01:22:51,262
- Show
- Look here

1492
01:22:51,472 --> 01:22:53,772
- Kumaresan bro's land?
- This is Sekar anna's land

1493
01:22:53,814 --> 01:22:55,792
- How did they get ownership?
- Don't know

1494
01:22:55,835 --> 01:22:57,835
Thamizh is here
Let's discuss it with him

1495
01:22:57,868 --> 01:22:59,076
I'll get back to you

1496
01:22:59,181 --> 01:23:00,472
Hey, come

1497
01:23:00,506 --> 01:23:02,506
- What's the problem?
- Factory is coming up here

1498
01:23:02,556 --> 01:23:04,626
Good if a factory comes up
Why protest for that?

1499
01:23:04,665 --> 01:23:06,629
Not an ordinary factory

1500
01:23:06,679 --> 01:23:09,048
It is a copper factory
which will affect people's health

1501
01:23:09,067 --> 01:23:10,526
What are the repercussions?

1502
01:23:10,667 --> 01:23:11,804
'Show me'

1503
01:23:11,846 --> 01:23:14,634
'Toxins from copper when melted
will disperse in the air'

1504
01:23:14,657 --> 01:23:17,429
'When people inhale, it will
irritate their respiratory tubes'

1505
01:23:17,471 --> 01:23:20,554
'And affect their lungs and lead to
miscarriages in pregnant women'

1506
01:23:20,596 --> 01:23:22,387
'It can affect even the next generation'

1507
01:23:22,429 --> 01:23:24,721
'A similar factory was
built in Maharashtra'

1508
01:23:24,745 --> 01:23:27,287
'People protested with
great difficulty and closed it'

1509
01:23:29,369 --> 01:23:31,616
- How did this happen?
- Means?

1510
01:23:31,658 --> 01:23:34,968
Can't happen without your knowledge
You would've only given the documents

1511
01:23:35,012 --> 01:23:39,109
A real estate group brought this land
in bulk intending to plan a layout

1512
01:23:39,148 --> 01:23:41,554
But I was not aware
of this factory plan

1513
01:23:41,596 --> 01:23:43,718
Your uncle Kuzhandhaivel
is completely in the loop

1514
01:23:43,752 --> 01:23:45,632
How did they get hold of
our people's lands?

1515
01:23:45,671 --> 01:23:47,338
All because of corporate rascals, bro

1516
01:23:47,387 --> 01:23:51,343
Everyone has bought 10 acres each
from registrar's office to mill owners

1517
01:23:51,373 --> 01:23:54,831
I think they sold each land separately
and handed it over to a corporate firm

1518
01:23:54,874 --> 01:23:57,273
This won't be accepted
anywhere else in our country

1519
01:23:57,304 --> 01:23:59,981
- What can we do now?
- We can't touch them

1520
01:24:00,036 --> 01:24:03,578
Bottom line, we can't even go
anywhere near their area

1521
01:24:05,064 --> 01:24:07,113
I was also wondering what to do

1522
01:24:07,155 --> 01:24:08,488
You gave me the perfect idea!

1523
01:24:08,530 --> 01:24:09,655
Amit

1524
01:24:10,114 --> 01:24:13,426
- Have they left?
- They got scared and ran away

1525
01:24:50,721 --> 01:24:52,129
Sir, shall I-

1526
01:24:52,189 --> 01:24:53,397
Get into the car

1527
01:24:59,097 --> 01:25:00,222
HEY...!

1528
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:02,767
All get in

1529
01:25:02,808 --> 01:25:04,725
Leave now
Right away

1530
01:25:08,957 --> 01:25:10,582
Take your vehicle and leave

1531
01:25:13,515 --> 01:25:14,582
'Listen, dear'

1532
01:25:14,965 --> 01:25:16,882
Your father wants to talk to you

1533
01:25:17,135 --> 01:25:19,130
- Tell me, pa
- 'What's the point in beating him?'

1534
01:25:19,171 --> 01:25:21,159
- This factory is bad news
- 'I know'

1535
01:25:21,205 --> 01:25:23,557
- 'You're hitting the wrong man, come home'
- No, but-

1536
01:25:23,593 --> 01:25:25,096
'Just listen to me'

1537
01:25:27,363 --> 01:25:29,780
Who the hell invented this wretched phone!

1538
01:25:45,119 --> 01:25:46,120
'It's wrong'

1539
01:25:46,163 --> 01:25:47,580
'I can handle it'

1540
01:25:48,012 --> 01:25:49,137
Hello, Devaraj

1541
01:25:49,179 --> 01:25:51,558
Is it something important
you want to discuss?

1542
01:25:51,589 --> 01:25:55,214
I believe a proposed factory here
will be hazardous for the entire town

1543
01:25:55,268 --> 01:25:57,268
Someone has fed you
wrong information

1544
01:25:57,310 --> 01:25:58,394
If this factory-

1545
01:25:58,469 --> 01:26:00,618
Hey! Get up
Get up, I say

1546
01:26:01,173 --> 01:26:03,798
Treating an elderly gentleman
with scant respect seated like this

1547
01:26:03,832 --> 01:26:05,498
You are speaking out of turn

1548
01:26:05,531 --> 01:26:07,495
- Do you know who I am?
- I care two hoots, da

1549
01:26:07,526 --> 01:26:09,981
First you find out about me,
my father and our entire town

1550
01:26:10,013 --> 01:26:12,225
Thamizh, let me handle this, okay?

1551
01:26:12,256 --> 01:26:14,225
Sanjay sir, please wait

1552
01:26:14,315 --> 01:26:16,022
Gopi, escort sir to the other room

1553
01:26:16,060 --> 01:26:18,144
- Please come, sir
- Wait for a little while

1554
01:26:27,397 --> 01:26:30,639
Devaraj, you're speaking
without knowing the actual facts

1555
01:26:30,770 --> 01:26:34,478
Most of our people will benefit
jobwise because of this factory

1556
01:26:34,717 --> 01:26:36,311
Our town will also prosper

1557
01:26:36,348 --> 01:26:37,931
Can you explain how?

1558
01:26:38,370 --> 01:26:41,100
Air we breathe is more important
than the money lining our pockets

1559
01:26:41,139 --> 01:26:43,358
Who needs a factory
which pollutes our atmosphere?

1560
01:26:43,381 --> 01:26:46,978
Kuzhandhai, we work hard and earn
only for the benefit of our next generation

1561
01:26:47,020 --> 01:26:49,061
By affecting our health
and our future generations

1562
01:26:49,103 --> 01:26:51,270
...why do we need that damn factory?

1563
01:26:51,420 --> 01:26:54,478
Devaraj, when a new factory is built...

1564
01:26:54,520 --> 01:26:56,889
...people are bound to object

1565
01:26:56,936 --> 01:26:58,770
You're getting emotional
listening to all that

1566
01:26:58,811 --> 01:27:01,020
Then how will our nation
become a superpower?

1567
01:27:01,061 --> 01:27:02,639
We are mainly an agricultural nation

1568
01:27:02,662 --> 01:27:05,334
If you leave our farmers in peace
we will become a superpower

1569
01:27:05,373 --> 01:27:06,853
It is no longer in our hands

1570
01:27:06,895 --> 01:27:09,077
Kuzhandhai, you are the MLA of our town

1571
01:27:09,116 --> 01:27:12,051
If we face any issue, you are
supposed to stop it and it is your duty

1572
01:27:12,089 --> 01:27:13,755
But if you instigate the issue!

1573
01:27:14,278 --> 01:27:15,311
I can't do it

1574
01:27:15,353 --> 01:27:17,497
Then that proposed factory
will remain a pipedream!

1575
01:27:17,527 --> 01:27:18,943
Do what you can

1576
01:27:19,053 --> 01:27:20,137
Come, my son

1577
01:27:23,269 --> 01:27:25,102
What gross injustice!

1578
01:27:25,135 --> 01:27:27,426
How can any man
stoop so low, Thamizh?

1579
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:29,435
Who, ma?
Appa's friend?

1580
01:27:29,537 --> 01:27:31,123
He has been like that from birth

1581
01:27:31,178 --> 01:27:33,224
Only we got to know about him rather late

1582
01:27:33,249 --> 01:27:35,520
Dai, how long will you
keep discussing this?

1583
01:27:35,563 --> 01:27:39,396
If you know someone is a wrongdoer,
you shouldn't harp on it, just let go

1584
01:27:39,867 --> 01:27:41,061
How can we let go?

1585
01:27:41,103 --> 01:27:43,978
Think he'll stop his plans
because you opposed this factory

1586
01:27:44,020 --> 01:27:46,853
He is moving everything legally
We should also get a stay legally

1587
01:27:46,895 --> 01:27:49,020
Big deal 'legal'?
Even if we take that route-

1588
01:27:49,061 --> 01:27:52,358
Uncle, only if we get a stay in your name,
you have to run from pillar to post

1589
01:27:52,405 --> 01:27:54,311
Let us get the stay
in your son's name

1590
01:27:54,350 --> 01:27:55,465
Vanakkam, leader

1591
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:56,900
Vanakkam, Thamizh

1592
01:27:56,946 --> 01:27:58,299
Please take a seat

1593
01:27:58,811 --> 01:28:00,478
- How are you, sir?
- Good, tell me

1594
01:28:00,512 --> 01:28:02,322
I've been warning you
from the beginning

1595
01:28:02,361 --> 01:28:04,366
Kuzhandhai is a bad apple

1596
01:28:04,397 --> 01:28:07,811
You were the only one who trusted him
and embraced him as your good friend

1597
01:28:07,853 --> 01:28:09,270
What happened now?

1598
01:28:09,482 --> 01:28:11,357
Just tell me
why you are here

1599
01:28:13,311 --> 01:28:14,853
Nothing much

1600
01:28:14,975 --> 01:28:17,889
My leader wanted me to
meet you and get your support

1601
01:28:17,944 --> 01:28:20,728
I'm not in a position
to talk about support now

1602
01:28:20,770 --> 01:28:22,103
You can please leav-

1603
01:28:22,145 --> 01:28:23,520
Listen to me
Both of us can-

1604
01:28:23,561 --> 01:28:24,975
Hasn't he made it very clear?

1605
01:28:25,006 --> 01:28:28,395
No, Thamizh, how can he build
a factory disregarding our objection?

1606
01:28:28,436 --> 01:28:30,395
We'll take care of that
You get going

1607
01:28:31,478 --> 01:28:32,478
Okay

1608
01:28:33,069 --> 01:28:36,028
Lady Luck will knock at your door
only once, kindly think and then decide

1609
01:28:36,061 --> 01:28:37,145
I'll take leave, sir

1610
01:28:37,186 --> 01:28:40,228
Stupid of me to have thought
I can line my pocket helping them

1611
01:28:40,270 --> 01:28:42,387
I hate these mediators
and party volunteers, pa!

1612
01:28:42,422 --> 01:28:45,755
Now all these politicians will step
in here asking you to support them

1613
01:28:46,043 --> 01:28:49,334
In the end only our family and
our townsfolk will be the worst sufferers

1614
01:28:50,132 --> 01:28:51,943
Please take a stand, uncle

1615
01:28:51,978 --> 01:28:53,734
What decision can I take, dear?

1616
01:28:53,759 --> 01:28:55,311
Stand against him
in this election

1617
01:28:55,353 --> 01:28:56,422
Let's see

1618
01:28:57,075 --> 01:28:58,409
Is this a game?

1619
01:28:58,759 --> 01:29:00,634
To impulsively compete and contest?

1620
01:29:00,834 --> 01:29:02,395
He has the authority already

1621
01:29:02,436 --> 01:29:03,940
Plus enough money power

1622
01:29:03,979 --> 01:29:06,425
Don't you know what happens
when power and money merge?

1623
01:29:06,457 --> 01:29:07,873
Who gave him the power?

1624
01:29:07,915 --> 01:29:10,457
We were the ones who loaded him
with all that authority

1625
01:29:10,498 --> 01:29:11,881
Let's snatch back the power

1626
01:29:11,914 --> 01:29:13,520
Hey! Don't talk like an imbecile

1627
01:29:13,545 --> 01:29:15,222
He has the back up
of a political party

1628
01:29:15,435 --> 01:29:17,227
Our entire town supports us, pa

1629
01:29:21,122 --> 01:29:22,131
Okay

1630
01:29:22,428 --> 01:29:24,276
In that case, you contest this election

1631
01:29:24,301 --> 01:29:25,474
Who...me?

1632
01:29:25,503 --> 01:29:26,540
Have you gone mad or-

1633
01:29:26,582 --> 01:29:27,873
Only you will contest

1634
01:29:27,915 --> 01:29:30,832
Whoever has dreams and desires
only he can bring about a change

1635
01:29:30,873 --> 01:29:33,128
Only he can guide the people
towards progress

1636
01:29:33,165 --> 01:29:34,832
I understand your feelings

1637
01:29:34,872 --> 01:29:39,123
If someone commits a crime, I feel
like beating him to a pulp, hacking him

1638
01:29:39,170 --> 01:29:40,756
I'm not patient like you

1639
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:43,332
The day I become as experienced
and knowledgeable as you

1640
01:29:43,363 --> 01:29:45,709
I learn to think and
I'm as patient as you

1641
01:29:45,748 --> 01:29:47,707
I'll contest then
It is your time now

1642
01:29:47,748 --> 01:29:48,832
Do something useful

1643
01:29:48,873 --> 01:29:51,457
- Well said, Thamizh
- Old lady, stop

1644
01:29:51,668 --> 01:29:53,482
Devaraj...my dear father Devaraj

1645
01:29:53,507 --> 01:29:55,058

1646
01:29:55,083 --> 01:29:56,756
- Come
- Please come, uncle

1647
01:29:56,781 --> 01:29:58,364
Vanakkam, aiya

1648
01:30:01,881 --> 01:30:05,423
Sir we have told Thamizh
whatever we thought sounds right

1649
01:30:05,448 --> 01:30:07,656
Whatever you decide
we will obey implicitly

1650
01:30:07,707 --> 01:30:09,832
- Please let us know, sir
- Yes, sir

1651
01:30:09,881 --> 01:30:12,123
- What is this, Thamizh?
- Aiya has accepted

1652
01:30:12,165 --> 01:30:13,457
Long live Devaraj aiya

1653
01:30:13,498 --> 01:30:16,457

- Somehow I feel

1671
01:32:39,531 --> 01:32:41,989
- Very scared
- Scared...why?

1672
01:32:42,040 --> 01:32:45,974
How will we uphold the trust and faith
our people have lavished us with?

1673
01:32:46,013 --> 01:32:48,290
We can do anything we want

This is the problem

1676
01:32:52,894 --> 01:32:54,310
Your anger scares me

1677
01:32:54,482 --> 01:32:55,936
What are you trying to say?

1678
01:32:55,961 --> 01:32:57,039
Don't lose your cool

1679
01:32:57,082 --> 01:32:59,207
This is how I don't want you to react

1680
01:32:59,246 --> 01:33:00,766
Listen to me patiently

1681
01:33:00,799 --> 01:33:02,799
Think and then decide

1682
01:33:03,418 --> 01:33:04,543
Only if need be

1683
01:33:04,576 --> 01:33:05,785
Lose your temper!

1684
01:33:08,222 --> 01:33:09,722
You got this MLA title

1685
01:33:09,896 --> 01:33:11,855
And I didn't realise
you were advising me

1686
01:33:12,589 --> 01:33:15,953
But people have been waiting
for a long time MLA Devaraj sir

1687
01:33:16,005 --> 01:33:18,555
Come, meet and greet them

I've trusted you and invested
a mountain load of money till now

1692
01:33:43,313 --> 01:33:44,748
How could you lose like this?

1693
01:33:44,790 --> 01:33:49,165
It is said a lion will be respected
only till it roams in the jungle

1694
01:33:49,391 --> 01:33:51,356
The same lion if it enters the town

1695

will bark at it I believe

01:33:57,248 --> 01:33:59,332

If he gets the stay
doomsday for us!

1699
01:34:02,742 --> 01:34:03,891
Don't be hasty, sir

1700
01:34:03,922 --> 01:34:05,957
So what if we lose?
There will be another election

1701
01:34:05,998 --> 01:34:07,165
'Won't we win then?'

1702
01:34:07,188 --> 01:34:09,016
What rubbish he's talking, huh?

1703
01:34:09,049 --> 01:34:12,617
No fireworks before Deepavali,
our festival of lights, sir

1704
01:34:14,719 --> 01:34:15,763
Did he say so?

1705
01:34:15,805 --> 01:34:17,373
- Vanakkam, sir
- Welcome

1706
01:34:17,403 --> 01:34:19,472
- Lawyer Gopal has come
- Good morning, sir

1707
01:34:19,523 --> 01:34:21,168
I've completed the court formalities

1708
01:34:21,207 --> 01:34:22,480
Please take a seat

1709
01:34:22,535 --> 01:34:26,531
If Thamizh signs the documents
tomorrow, stay is confirmed

1710
01:34:26,582 --> 01:34:28,227
- Thamizh, will you go?
- Anna

1711
01:34:28,266 --> 01:34:29,818
Tomorrow is our temple festival

1712
01:34:29,859 --> 01:34:31,944
Can't you finish this 2 days later?

1713
01:34:31,998 --> 01:34:34,873
Our people's problems are
as important as our temple festival

1714
01:34:34,915 --> 01:34:37,207
Isn't that why our lawyer
has come in person, huh?

1715
01:34:37,464 --> 01:34:38,600
- Thamizh
- Appa

1716
01:34:38,630 --> 01:34:41,031
Go sign and then come
to the festival directly

1717
01:34:41,082 --> 01:34:42,453
Until then we'll take care

1718
01:34:42,492 --> 01:34:43,957
- What do you say?
- Okay, sir

1719
01:34:43,998 --> 01:34:45,258
I'll take leave

1720
01:34:45,295 --> 01:34:47,504
- Tomorrow then
- I'll be there for sure

1721
01:35:22,555 --> 01:35:24,250
- Where are you?
- What, darling?

1722
01:35:24,289 --> 01:35:25,492
Your parents asked for you

1723
01:35:25,543 --> 01:35:27,377
Lawyer's office
I told you, no?

1724
01:35:27,518 --> 01:35:30,330
All the couples here
are enjoying themselves

1725
01:35:30,367 --> 01:35:31,555
'Why can't you hurry up?'

1726
01:35:31,601 --> 01:35:32,903
Okay, I'll come

1727
01:35:32,953 --> 01:35:35,222
I got dressed in a sari
just for your sake, dear

1728
01:35:35,263 --> 01:35:36,388
I'll be there!

1729
01:35:38,680 --> 01:35:40,549
I'll just tell aunt
where uncle is and be back

1730
01:35:40,575 --> 01:35:42,450
- 5 minutes
- Come soon

1731
01:35:42,630 --> 01:35:45,047
She is asking for a 'laddu'
Find out what she wants

1732
01:35:45,097 --> 01:35:46,597
You want a 'laddu'?

1733
01:35:46,638 --> 01:35:48,242
Thenu, buy it for her

1734
01:35:48,267 --> 01:35:50,850
- She's very stubborn
- Hold my hand

1735
01:35:53,554 --> 01:35:55,096
How long will it take?

1736
01:35:55,555 --> 01:35:56,805
I'll be there, Thamizh

1737
01:35:56,847 --> 01:36:00,888
I had a flat tyre on the way
I'll be there in half an hour

1738
01:36:00,930 --> 01:36:02,388
I've been waiting for so long

1739
01:36:02,430 --> 01:36:03,888
I'm on my way

1740
01:36:03,930 --> 01:36:06,467
- I must attend the temple festival
- 'I am coming with you too'

1741
01:36:06,492 --> 01:36:08,027
We can go together

1742
01:36:10,190 --> 01:36:11,731
- Who wants tea?
- Me

1743
01:36:12,180 --> 01:36:13,555
All I asked was tea

1744
01:36:13,597 --> 01:36:15,055
Not anything else, go!

1745
01:36:16,559 --> 01:36:18,643
Amma, I'm feeling sleepy

1746
01:36:18,685 --> 01:36:21,024
Amma, we'll go home
She's feeling sleepy it seems

1747
01:36:21,065 --> 01:36:23,331
You be here
I'll take her with me

1748
01:36:23,356 --> 01:36:25,039
I'll also go home, ma

1749
01:36:25,088 --> 01:36:26,546
You watch the events and come

1750
01:36:26,597 --> 01:36:28,930
- They will be having fun
- We can also join the fun

1751
01:36:28,972 --> 01:36:30,430
Why feel bad?

1752
01:36:30,589 --> 01:36:32,089
Why are you here?

1753
01:36:32,375 --> 01:36:35,513
- Not attending the temple festival?
- Lawyer said we have a hearing on Monday

1754
01:36:35,555 --> 01:36:36,633
He asked me to wait

1755
01:36:36,680 --> 01:36:38,888
- Hearing on Monday?
- He said he'll be here now

1756
01:36:38,930 --> 01:36:40,347
Your hearing is only next week

1757
01:36:40,388 --> 01:36:41,930
- Really?
- Why did he say this?

1758
01:36:43,656 --> 01:36:45,013
- Yov Gopal
- Hello?

1759
01:36:45,062 --> 01:36:46,479
Thamizh has come

1760
01:36:46,627 --> 01:36:48,453
You said you're in Theni it seems

1761
01:36:48,500 --> 01:36:50,893
Hey! Ramana
Don't blabber something

1762
01:36:50,932 --> 01:36:53,515
'Just keep saying I'm coming
whatever Thamizh asks you'

1763
01:36:53,820 --> 01:36:54,884
'Got it?'

1764
01:36:55,065 --> 01:36:57,472
If you betray those who trust you
whom do we trust then?

1765
01:36:57,513 --> 01:36:59,513
- Thamizh?!
- Tell me the truth

1766
01:36:59,555 --> 01:37:01,063
In that temple festival-

1767
01:37:01,225 --> 01:37:03,546
- What's happening?
- What are you doing?

1768
01:37:03,632 --> 01:37:04,789
Thamizh knows our plan

1769
01:37:04,823 --> 01:37:07,656
How do you know he knows
our plan? Just don't blabber

1770
01:37:08,055 --> 01:37:10,135
Bro, give 2 'laddu' to this little one

1771
01:37:10,520 --> 01:37:13,187
'Help yourself
How can I refuse you?'

1772
01:37:14,347 --> 01:37:15,763
Give this little girl 'laddu'

1773
01:37:16,133 --> 01:37:18,401
- Thenu!!
- Have you reached?

1774
01:37:18,448 --> 01:37:20,656
I'm on the way but ensure
everyone evacuates

1775
01:37:20,695 --> 01:37:22,347
- Aren't you coming?
- Thenu, I'm scared

1776
01:37:22,380 --> 01:37:24,164
1st ask everyone to leave the premises

1777
01:37:24,206 --> 01:37:25,372
Tell me why

1778
01:37:25,420 --> 01:37:27,337
Even I don't know
Just ask everyone to leave

1779
01:37:27,372 --> 01:37:28,664
But tell me-

1780
01:37:28,964 --> 01:37:30,673
HEY THENU!!

1781
01:38:22,760 --> 01:38:24,051
MA...!!

1782
01:38:30,278 --> 01:38:31,695
Mother

1783
01:38:43,835 --> 01:38:45,335
Amma!

1784
01:38:50,132 --> 01:38:51,554
APPA!

1785
01:39:00,852 --> 01:39:02,202
Father!

1786
01:39:14,989 --> 01:39:16,281
Appa

1787
01:39:16,996 --> 01:39:18,531
Father

1788
01:39:18,930 --> 01:39:20,430
Father!

1789
01:39:22,040 --> 01:39:24,898
- Appa
- For just me, 1 individual

1790
01:39:25,055 --> 01:39:27,703
...they have killed so many innocent people

1791
01:39:27,742 --> 01:39:33,450
We haven't done anything for all those
who trusted and voted for us, Thamizh

1792
01:39:33,971 --> 01:39:34,971
Appa

1793
01:39:35,847 --> 01:39:37,097
APPA!

1794
01:39:37,761 --> 01:39:39,011
APPA...!

1795
01:39:51,035 --> 01:39:52,157
Traitor!

1796
01:39:52,200 --> 01:39:53,825
Even now it isn't too late

1797
01:39:53,865 --> 01:39:56,441
Go on your bended knees,
beg forgiveness

1798
01:39:56,474 --> 01:39:58,579
And get the hell out of this town

1799
01:39:59,258 --> 01:40:00,758
I'll spare you then

1800
01:40:18,386 --> 01:40:21,988
Do you listen if I tell you not to keep
the gas cylinder near the stove?

1801
01:40:24,367 --> 01:40:26,887
Throw these eyesores
into the blazing flames

1802
01:40:41,444 --> 01:40:43,151
Amma...!

1803
01:40:47,049 --> 01:40:49,382
Save my child!

1804
01:40:49,979 --> 01:40:52,917
Please save my daughter

1805
01:40:53,448 --> 01:40:55,549
'Please save my baby'

1806
01:40:57,043 --> 01:41:00,585
'Aiyo! Oh God
Please save my baby'

1807
01:41:00,856 --> 01:41:03,526
Someone please save my child

1808
01:41:07,534 --> 01:41:09,159
Amma...!

1809
01:41:16,680 --> 01:41:19,180
Someone...please help me
Save my baby

1810
01:41:24,924 --> 01:41:25,924
Kavya

1811
01:41:32,097 --> 01:41:33,871
- Kavya
- Amma!

1812
01:41:44,213 --> 01:41:46,338
I've verified everything about him, sir

1813
01:41:46,645 --> 01:41:48,230
His name is Murugan

1814
01:41:48,401 --> 01:41:49,458
He has no mother

1815
01:41:49,511 --> 01:41:50,870
Father's name Gurumurthy

1816
01:41:51,555 --> 01:41:53,301
He has 2 sisters

1817
01:41:53,511 --> 01:41:55,674
His akka's husband works in the railways

1818
01:41:55,713 --> 01:41:57,644
His younger sister got married just now

1819
01:41:58,638 --> 01:41:59,930
What does he do?

1820
01:42:00,050 --> 01:42:02,182
He's trying to get a break in films, sir

1821
01:42:02,200 --> 01:42:03,950
- Cinema?
- Yes, sir

1822
01:42:10,715 --> 01:42:12,132
Bring him in

1823
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:25,653
You go first, sir

1824
01:42:27,788 --> 01:42:29,080
Good morning, sir

1825
01:42:29,385 --> 01:42:30,489
How are you, sir?

1826
01:42:30,547 --> 01:42:32,754
- Sit down
- No, it's okay, sir

1827
01:42:33,536 --> 01:42:34,703
Please sit

1828
01:42:37,805 --> 01:42:39,222
Please take a seat, sir

1829
01:42:42,730 --> 01:42:43,777
Tell me, sir

1830
01:42:44,072 --> 01:42:46,690
I heard about it
You and my daughter-

1831
01:42:46,745 --> 01:42:48,331
Enquire about me in my area, sir

1832
01:42:48,378 --> 01:42:50,105
I respect women

1833
01:42:50,141 --> 01:42:51,737
- What, sir?
- Yes, sir

1834
01:42:51,769 --> 01:42:53,013
My daughter told me

1835
01:42:53,055 --> 01:42:55,763
1st you were just friends and then
she was the one who compelled you

1836
01:42:55,805 --> 01:42:56,930
Everything I know

1837
01:42:56,972 --> 01:42:58,472
- But
- Sir

1838
01:42:58,700 --> 01:43:02,159
'As is batter so is dumpling'
Popular proverb in our area

1839
01:43:02,191 --> 01:43:05,222
You've raised your daughter like sweet
dipped in ghee, in the lap of luxury

1840
01:43:05,239 --> 01:43:08,989
You'll find it bitter to get her married to
a caramel candy that's worth just 2 bucks

1841
01:43:10,712 --> 01:43:12,545
I like you very much

1842
01:43:12,726 --> 01:43:14,059
You too, sir?

1843
01:43:15,648 --> 01:43:18,183
- So you approve of me as groom, sir?
- Yes

1844
01:43:18,394 --> 01:43:22,370
Let's finalize right now, when, where,
and what time can we fix the wedding?

1845
01:43:22,409 --> 01:43:23,581
My father is total junk, sir

1846
01:43:23,624 --> 01:43:27,050
Before this wedding
you have a task to complete

1847
01:43:27,085 --> 01:43:33,447
In Theni my friend Devaraj and I wanted
to set up a factory for the town to prosper

1848
01:43:33,852 --> 01:43:38,807
The MLA of that town was apprehensive
of my friend usurping his post

1849
01:43:38,838 --> 01:43:40,588
He put a spoke in our wheel

1850
01:43:40,677 --> 01:43:42,261
My friend's son

1851
01:43:42,820 --> 01:43:45,855
Looks ditto, carbon copy like you

1852
01:43:46,411 --> 01:43:48,036
- Like me, sir?
- Yes

1853
01:43:56,353 --> 01:43:59,894
- Sir, he looks ditto me
- Yes, sir

1854
01:43:59,948 --> 01:44:01,323
Continue your story, sir

1855
01:44:01,388 --> 01:44:04,941
He killed my friend and son to safeguard
his MLA post and ruin our business

1856
01:44:04,985 --> 01:44:07,724
- Sir, I got it
- Really?

1857
01:44:07,785 --> 01:44:10,535
I must live that character's role
and contest the election and win

1858
01:44:10,570 --> 01:44:13,646
Your factory should be built and we must
help the townsfolk, that's all, sir?

1859
01:44:13,687 --> 01:44:15,562
- That's all, no?
- Sir

1860
01:44:15,815 --> 01:44:17,690
Why is it a surprise, sir?

1861
01:44:17,716 --> 01:44:19,550
That's a double action script for you

1862
01:44:19,597 --> 01:44:22,722
If a father and his sons live in
different places and then they unite

1863
01:44:22,763 --> 01:44:24,847
That is Kamal Haasan in
'Aboorva Sagodharargal'

1864
01:44:24,888 --> 01:44:28,638
If different fathers and sons are born
in different places and they trade places

1865
01:44:28,680 --> 01:44:31,555
That is superstar Rajinikanth's
'Rajadhi Raja' and 'Billa'

1866
01:44:31,597 --> 01:44:34,484
It's as simple as this, sir
Why do you have such a shocked look?

1867
01:44:34,518 --> 01:44:36,726
You walk, talk, eat, sleep
Tamil cinema, sir

1868
01:44:36,995 --> 01:44:38,245
Sir, he's a legend!

1869
01:44:38,305 --> 01:44:39,675
He's my inspiration

1870
01:44:39,714 --> 01:44:40,820
Forget him for a moment

1871
01:44:40,851 --> 01:44:43,847
If I have to take up this project
I have some prior commitments, sir

1872
01:44:43,898 --> 01:44:46,398
I have a family, some issues
and a huge debt to repay, sir

1873
01:44:46,448 --> 01:44:47,906
Shall we settle for 5?

1874
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:50,820
He starts sky-high
with 5 lakhs, sir?

1875
01:44:50,855 --> 01:44:52,894
If that isn't enough
we can close the deal for 7

1876
01:44:52,940 --> 01:44:54,231
7, sir?

1877
01:44:55,723 --> 01:44:56,807
Sir

1878
01:44:58,862 --> 01:45:01,135
If we put our heads together
he hikes up the amount

1879
01:45:01,182 --> 01:45:03,515
- What do we do, sir?
- Let's keep whispering

1880
01:45:03,558 --> 01:45:05,555
How are you, sir?
'Is your grandma doing good?'

1881
01:45:05,597 --> 01:45:07,472
- She insists on eating 'paya'
- 10, final

1882
01:45:09,633 --> 01:45:11,133
100 million

1883
01:45:11,711 --> 01:45:13,492
What about GST and tax?

1884
01:45:19,893 --> 01:45:22,296
'GST, Income tax
All that I'll take care'

1885
01:45:22,565 --> 01:45:23,981
Don't worry, okay?

1886
01:45:25,829 --> 01:45:28,787
Sir, it is double okay for me

1887
01:45:28,921 --> 01:45:31,588
Sir, then the character
I have to play, his name

1888
01:45:31,645 --> 01:45:35,273
I'll do all my homework and
be on my toes when I go to that town

1889
01:45:35,309 --> 01:45:37,581
You meet the village officer
called Venkatesh

1890
01:45:38,057 --> 01:45:41,956
Sir, our payment isn't inclusive
of that Venkatesh's amount, right?

1891
01:45:41,989 --> 01:45:44,823
10 crores
100 million

1892
01:45:45,327 --> 01:45:46,355
All yours

1893
01:45:46,391 --> 01:45:47,974
- Happy?
- Happy, sir

1894
01:45:48,022 --> 01:45:50,689
I'll text you my account number in
the morning Kindly transfer the amount

1895
01:45:50,726 --> 01:45:52,143
What did you say his name was?

1896
01:45:52,183 --> 01:45:53,354
His name

1897
01:45:54,362 --> 01:45:56,088
Sangathamizhan

1898
01:45:56,494 --> 01:45:59,202
The next time you'll see me
only as 'Sangathamizhan'

1899
01:46:01,893 --> 01:46:03,515
Seems like good quality

1900
01:46:03,583 --> 01:46:05,917
Bro, Thamizh is not dead it seems

1901
01:46:08,919 --> 01:46:11,586
- What do you mean?
- He's coming into town tomorrow

1902
01:46:25,365 --> 01:46:27,145
'Who is this joker?'

1903
01:46:48,284 --> 01:46:50,225
- Thamizh?
- Thamizh anna?

1904
01:46:50,293 --> 01:46:51,627
How are you, bro?

1905
01:46:52,144 --> 01:46:53,347
I'm good and you?

1906
01:46:53,388 --> 01:46:55,513
Thamizh, I'll take care
of everything for you

1907
01:46:55,555 --> 01:46:57,801
Don't worry about anything
Sanjay sir has briefed me

1908
01:46:57,832 --> 01:46:59,680
Please look depressed and distressed

1909
01:46:59,703 --> 01:47:02,620
- Coolers, get the luggage
- 'He thinks I'm a coolie?!'

1910
01:47:03,217 --> 01:47:05,509
Thamizh...sir?

1911
01:47:06,411 --> 01:47:07,840
I thought you were dead

1912
01:47:07,875 --> 01:47:10,125
Only after seeing you
I am able to breathe normally

1913
01:47:10,174 --> 01:47:13,092
Without you in our lives
all of us felt orphaned

1914
01:47:13,129 --> 01:47:14,843
He has destroyed our town

1915
01:47:14,879 --> 01:47:17,480
- Shouldn't spare him
- He's back, he'll take care

1916
01:47:17,516 --> 01:47:19,559
Bro...anna!

1917
01:47:19,684 --> 01:47:21,184
How are you, anna?

1918
01:47:21,582 --> 01:47:24,957
Bro, we never thought
we would see you again

1919
01:47:24,997 --> 01:47:29,081
Everyone died in the fire accident
in the temple festival, bro

1920
01:47:29,114 --> 01:47:31,323
No one left for me to call as 'family'

1921
01:47:31,357 --> 01:47:35,649
Bro, you should keep the baby I'm carrying
in your lap and have her ears pierced

1922
01:47:35,791 --> 01:47:38,916
Now you are back
This is all we need, bro

1923
01:47:38,976 --> 01:47:40,893
- He'll do it, don't worry
- That's enough, bro

1924
01:47:55,343 --> 01:47:56,510
Thamizh

1925
01:47:57,838 --> 01:48:00,526
The lady holding a plate to
welcome you is your grandma

1926
01:48:00,570 --> 01:48:03,975
Thenmozhi's mother is the one
standing before the pillar, your aunt

1927
01:48:04,090 --> 01:48:06,370
The 2 brats standing below
are your sister's children

1928
01:48:07,620 --> 01:48:08,953
Bless you, my grandson

1929
01:48:13,431 --> 01:48:15,843
'Whole town fell for this ploy
But his dog knows otherwise!

1930
01:48:15,868 --> 01:48:17,275
'Thank God it can't talk!'

1931
01:48:18,458 --> 01:48:19,875
How are you, aunt?

1932
01:48:23,315 --> 01:48:24,658
[sniffles]

1933
01:48:24,714 --> 01:48:25,846
'Go inside'

1934
01:48:34,722 --> 01:48:36,097
'Thamizh'

1935
01:48:36,539 --> 01:48:38,537
Refresh yourself
We can have lunch

1936
01:48:38,592 --> 01:48:40,638
'He has started living his role at once'

1937
01:48:40,680 --> 01:48:42,733
Thamizh, your acting skill is A1

1938
01:48:42,757 --> 01:48:44,340
Maintain the same grief

1939
01:48:44,375 --> 01:48:46,125
I'll see you later
Take care

1940
01:48:46,167 --> 01:48:49,500
- We'll also leave, bro
- See you

1941
01:48:49,596 --> 01:48:51,762
See you, uncle

1942
01:49:00,208 --> 01:49:01,500
Give it, bro

1943
01:49:05,495 --> 01:49:06,518
Sorry

1944
01:49:06,548 --> 01:49:07,955
She's my sister

1945
01:49:07,982 --> 01:49:09,816
No chance in a million years

1946
01:49:10,127 --> 01:49:11,276
Forget all that

1947
01:49:11,317 --> 01:49:13,831
Where was Thamizh all along?
And what was he doing?

1948
01:49:13,874 --> 01:49:15,332
'He has a valid point'

1949
01:49:15,555 --> 01:49:16,680
Let me test him

1950
01:49:16,722 --> 01:49:19,518
Listen to me, tell me the truth
without pushing it under the rug

1951
01:49:19,563 --> 01:49:22,182
I'll come clean
Who are you in this house?

1952
01:49:22,211 --> 01:49:23,253
I am the servant here

1953
01:49:23,294 --> 01:49:25,794
Thamizh fled to Bombay from here
and stayed there for 3 months

1954
01:49:25,836 --> 01:49:27,682
Beat up a gang of rowdies to a pulp

1955
01:49:27,722 --> 01:49:30,773
He took a bus to Pakistan and
shot all the terrorists over there!

1956
01:49:30,807 --> 01:49:35,508
He came via the sea to Chennai and
knocked down all the politicians and thugs

1957
01:49:35,544 --> 01:49:37,794
- After that?
- Then he got homesick

1958
01:49:37,836 --> 01:49:39,562
He made a beeline back home

1959
01:49:41,328 --> 01:49:42,711
Is that all?

1960
01:49:43,190 --> 01:49:45,766
I imagined the worst
and had nightmares

1961
01:49:45,803 --> 01:49:48,375
Even I thought you will be
my worst nightmare!

1962
01:49:48,412 --> 01:49:49,620
- Hello?
- Now what?

1963
01:49:49,663 --> 01:49:52,080
Okay, what were you doing?

1964
01:49:52,448 --> 01:49:55,472
If you are a servant you stick to that
Not think of yourself as James Bond

1965
01:49:55,513 --> 01:49:57,555
The hero won't like it
if you do so

1966
01:49:59,265 --> 01:50:00,719
'What audacity!'

1967
01:50:01,308 --> 01:50:04,099
'Where did you pick him up?
He is 101% carbon copy, sir'

1968
01:50:04,221 --> 01:50:05,887
His family believed his story

1969
01:50:05,983 --> 01:50:07,441
People of this town fell for it

1970
01:50:07,468 --> 01:50:08,955
'Our party took his word for gospel'

1971
01:50:08,985 --> 01:50:11,151
He is on his way to meet Kuzhandhai

1972
01:50:11,479 --> 01:50:13,479
If Kuzhandhai also swallows his story-

1973
01:50:30,360 --> 01:50:31,874
Vanakkam, uncle
How are you?

1974
01:50:31,916 --> 01:50:34,041
- Who the hell are you?
- That isn't relevant now

1975
01:50:34,072 --> 01:50:36,368
When someone greets you
learn to return the gesture

1976
01:50:36,399 --> 01:50:38,731
Sir, I think he found out
I'm duplicate, let's scoot now

1977
01:50:38,773 --> 01:50:40,307
Why do you jump to conclusions?

1978
01:50:40,347 --> 01:50:42,472
You let your charisma flow
I'm there to support you

1979
01:50:42,505 --> 01:50:44,672
- Who are you?
- You guessed right, I'm not Thamizh

1980
01:50:44,710 --> 01:50:45,874
- Sir?
- Waitees

1981
01:50:45,915 --> 01:50:49,213
But I'll do twice the good
Thamizh will do for this town

1982
01:50:49,245 --> 01:50:52,055
I've been getting to know
the townsfolk for the past few days

1983
01:50:52,312 --> 01:50:55,895
What loving care, concern and gratitude

1984
01:50:56,409 --> 01:50:59,377
You're betraying your own people
grasping for some pipedream

1985
01:50:59,495 --> 01:51:00,593
Is this fair on your part?

1986
01:51:00,638 --> 01:51:02,513
Do you think of yourself as Thamizh?

1987
01:51:02,555 --> 01:51:04,347
We buy a mobile for 100000

1988
01:51:04,388 --> 01:51:08,388
But the same duplicate mobile
is available in the market

1989
01:51:08,425 --> 01:51:12,331
Don't I know the plus and minus
of the original and duplicate?

1990
01:51:12,354 --> 01:51:13,520
- Sir
- What, sir?

1991
01:51:13,547 --> 01:51:15,339
He speaks like a phone mechanic

1992
01:51:15,387 --> 01:51:16,846
Maybe he is one!

1993
01:51:17,388 --> 01:51:19,042
You're right
I am a duplicate

1994
01:51:19,088 --> 01:51:20,854
But a duplicate phone
heats up very fast

1995
01:51:20,893 --> 01:51:22,351
And head will explode

1996
01:51:22,401 --> 01:51:24,734
You may roam around
with 'posh and class'

1997
01:51:25,347 --> 01:51:27,540
But you don't know
my skill en masse, right?

1998
01:51:27,618 --> 01:51:28,618
Kuzhandhai

1999
01:51:30,198 --> 01:51:31,948
Wait and watch!

2000
01:51:42,049 --> 01:51:43,854
'Take pictures of our town?'

2001
01:51:43,899 --> 01:51:46,381
'- Village photography is my project
- Why is she here?'

2002
01:51:46,406 --> 01:51:47,972
'She has come to snitch on you'

2003
01:51:48,013 --> 01:51:50,305
- When did you come?
- Hi Thamizh, hi bro

2004
01:51:51,418 --> 01:51:54,043
Ma, I need some time alone

2005
01:51:55,052 --> 01:51:56,261
To talk personally

2006
01:51:56,316 --> 01:51:58,072
- Thamizh go and talk
- No, it's okay

2007
01:51:58,111 --> 01:51:59,986
- Aunt
- 'Amma, let us go in'

2008
01:52:00,364 --> 01:52:02,268
Madcap! What will my aunt think of us?

2009
01:52:02,312 --> 01:52:04,895
You forgot your town
You even forgot your name

2010
01:52:05,270 --> 01:52:07,437
As if it's that tough to forget me?!

2011
01:52:09,685 --> 01:52:10,765
Not like that-

2012
01:52:10,805 --> 01:52:11,860
Don't be scared

2013
01:52:11,891 --> 01:52:16,641
I told everyone you are my friend
and I'm here to work on my project

2014
01:52:16,913 --> 01:52:19,900
I fell in love with Murugan
I'll learn to live with Thamizh

2015
01:52:19,963 --> 01:52:21,916
'Murugan, huh?'

2016
01:52:23,436 --> 01:52:25,269
Take her suitcase inside, da

2017
01:52:26,426 --> 01:52:28,714
Shall we talk as we go?

2018
01:52:30,958 --> 01:52:33,159
Who is that girl?

2019
01:52:33,222 --> 01:52:36,097
Says she fell in love with Murugan
and she'll learn to live with Thamizh

2020
01:52:36,122 --> 01:52:37,456
What is happening here?

2021
01:52:37,487 --> 01:52:38,713
'How do I cover up now?'

2022
01:52:38,742 --> 01:52:39,742
Let me explain

2023
01:52:39,797 --> 01:52:41,589
This girl fell in love with Murugan

2024
01:52:41,645 --> 01:52:42,812
- Who is Murugan?
- God

2025
01:52:42,861 --> 01:52:44,027
- Which place?
- Tamil Nadu

2026
01:52:44,061 --> 01:52:45,658
So Thamizh and Murugan are linked

2027
01:52:45,697 --> 01:52:49,072
Since Thamizh looks like Murugan
she says she'll live with Thamizh

2028
01:52:49,994 --> 01:52:51,323
'He fell for my yarn'

2029
01:52:51,341 --> 01:52:52,675
Is that all?

2030
01:52:52,755 --> 01:52:55,086
I imagined the worst and
thought I'll get nightmares!

2031
01:52:55,117 --> 01:52:57,805
You have an uncanny habit of
grasping like camphor catches fire!

2032
01:52:57,847 --> 01:52:59,531
Then what?
Can I lead a good life?

2033
01:52:59,562 --> 01:53:02,078
Only in this house the servant
doubles up as James Bond!

2034
01:53:02,125 --> 01:53:04,898
James Bond! Wash the tumbler
and make me a good cup of coffee

2035
01:53:04,941 --> 01:53:06,898
Will you ask me
any more questions?

2036
01:53:06,608 --> 01:53:10,483
'Govt Hospital
Maruthamangalam'

2037
01:53:10,823 --> 01:53:12,748
Hospital has a new look now

2038
01:53:12,774 --> 01:53:15,461
You should've seen the hell hole we had!

2039
01:53:15,524 --> 01:53:17,336
Two of you hold it

2040
01:53:18,108 --> 01:53:20,066
Stop it...stop it right there

2041
01:53:20,108 --> 01:53:23,399
Who gave you permission to unload
private equipment in a Govt hospital?

2042
01:53:23,441 --> 01:53:25,399
Sir, we are only trying
to help the people

2043
01:53:25,441 --> 01:53:27,644
Who are you to help them
without Govt authorization?

2044
01:53:27,691 --> 01:53:31,316
You asked the right question frankly
so much so I feel like dying of shame!

2045
01:53:32,190 --> 01:53:33,690
1 minute
Please come aside

2046
01:53:33,733 --> 01:53:37,370
- I don't get my palms greased
- Neither do I offer bribes

2047
01:53:37,417 --> 01:53:39,362
I don't think he gets it
Kindly explain

2048
01:53:39,393 --> 01:53:41,185
- Come
- He's educated, go

2049
01:53:42,558 --> 01:53:45,316
- Talk to them, sir
- What can I say, sir?

2050
01:53:45,358 --> 01:53:48,358
When you get into politics one day
this will serve as a good experience

2051
01:53:48,399 --> 01:53:52,274
- When did I tell you politics was my goal?
- That's the normal route for any actor

2052
01:53:52,316 --> 01:53:55,483
Some act and get into politics
Some step into politics and act

2053
01:53:55,524 --> 01:53:57,358
Some act to get into politics

2054
01:53:57,399 --> 01:54:00,566
We will enter politics after acting
But we won't act after we enter politics

2055
01:54:00,608 --> 01:54:02,941
That is 'us'
Is my logic right?

2056
01:54:02,983 --> 01:54:04,233
What should I do now, sir?

2057
01:54:04,274 --> 01:54:06,399
People are facing an issue
Go and resolve it for them

2058
01:54:06,441 --> 01:54:07,941
People's leader
People's spokesman

2059
01:54:07,983 --> 01:54:09,483
I'll come when I should, sir

2060
01:54:09,524 --> 01:54:11,441
- Everything is wrong
- Tamil Nadu is waiting

2061
01:54:11,483 --> 01:54:14,483
Everything is in place
Otherwise Thamizh won't get involved

2062
01:54:14,524 --> 01:54:16,441
- What have you studied?
- IAS

2063
01:54:16,483 --> 01:54:18,191
- Do you know to read English?
- Of course

2064
01:54:18,233 --> 01:54:19,316
Give that to me

2065
01:54:19,351 --> 01:54:20,935
Here...read this

2066
01:54:22,019 --> 01:54:25,206
These equipment should have
reached this hospital 6 months ago

2067
01:54:25,941 --> 01:54:27,483
- You've signed this
- Me?

2068
01:54:27,524 --> 01:54:30,233
Your name is Sadhasivam?
Isn't that your signature?

2069
01:54:30,273 --> 01:54:31,357
- Yes
- That's all

2070
01:54:31,398 --> 01:54:32,690
Problem solved
You can go

2071
01:54:33,358 --> 01:54:34,816
Are you here to create a problem?

2072
01:54:34,858 --> 01:54:37,774
Hello, sir, shall we
create a problem?

2073
01:54:37,816 --> 01:54:39,399
- 'I am free to pitch in'
- Gone case!

2074
01:54:39,441 --> 01:54:41,941
We have no problem
All the laws are in place

2075
01:54:41,983 --> 01:54:45,816
Brother-in-law, go and tell
your father-in-law, 'bilal' is all fine

2076
01:54:45,856 --> 01:54:48,147
- It's called 'by-law'
- You know, eh?

2077
01:54:48,191 --> 01:54:50,358
- So instead of correcting me
- Don't butt in

2078
01:54:50,399 --> 01:54:52,608
Go and straighten up
the man who sent you

2079
01:54:53,358 --> 01:54:54,566
He and his fancy tie!

2080
01:54:54,608 --> 01:54:57,503
- Acting smart with me?
- 'Earns his money playing his card right'

2081
01:54:57,553 --> 01:54:58,636
Superb act!

2082
01:54:59,685 --> 01:55:00,737
'Hello?'

2083
01:55:00,762 --> 01:55:02,917
'The collector you sent
did his job perfectly'

2084
01:55:03,015 --> 01:55:04,182
'He isn't to blame'

2085
01:55:04,456 --> 01:55:06,944
But I had the hammer to nail
his coffin, we've sent it to you

2086
01:55:06,983 --> 01:55:08,774
'Come up with a sound idea next time'

2087
01:55:08,807 --> 01:55:10,599
This is just the 1st round of our game

2088
01:55:38,316 --> 01:55:43,149
"There are ways to protect a millionaire
who swindles playing unfair"

2089
01:55:43,191 --> 01:55:47,524
"But there's room in prison
for only the poverty stricken"

2090
01:55:47,577 --> 01:55:52,108
"Fund for spaceships flow in plenty
Do we need toilets as basic amenity?!"

2091
01:55:52,167 --> 01:55:56,334
"Land is available to build many a mill
Why do we need fields to till?!"

2092
01:55:56,398 --> 01:56:00,065
"Won't the horizon light up?"

2093
01:56:01,358 --> 01:56:05,108
"Can't you climb to the top?"

2094
01:56:05,983 --> 01:56:09,524
"If truth is your loyal voice"

2095
01:56:10,483 --> 01:56:14,566
"Won't victory be yours to rejoice?
Rebel to revel, my boys"

2096
01:56:14,608 --> 01:56:19,608
"Won't times change in our favor?
Won't the scenario turn as a makeover?"

2097
01:56:19,691 --> 01:56:24,274
"If united we stand in compliance
won't ruling party change hands?"

2098
01:56:24,358 --> 01:56:28,858
"Won't our life tide over this sadness?
Won't our gloom give way to gladness?"

2099
01:56:28,899 --> 01:56:33,617
"If we are the change per se
won't everything modify anyway?"

2100
01:56:51,108 --> 01:56:56,108
"There are ways to rescue and restore
a man who swindles in millions and more"

2101
01:56:56,152 --> 01:57:00,569
"But there's room in prison
for only the poverty stricken"

2102
01:57:00,691 --> 01:57:05,191
"Fund for spaceships flow in plenty
Do we need toilets as basic amenity?!"

2103
01:57:05,233 --> 01:57:09,608
"Land is available to build many a mill
Why do we need fields to till?!"

2104
01:57:42,274 --> 01:57:50,274
"Saw tears of joy replace drops of distress
We saw pleasure climb into hearts of kids"

2105
01:57:50,316 --> 01:57:54,858
"In eyes small and innocent
dreams enormous and eloquent"

2106
01:57:54,899 --> 01:57:59,501
"Shall we break the barriers right now
that hinder such dreams to grow?"

2107
01:57:59,566 --> 01:58:04,066
"Political parties old and obsolete
Create a new one with laws concrete"

2108
01:58:04,108 --> 01:58:09,441
"Sit up, sprint to victory
Record a new chapter in history"

2109
01:58:09,483 --> 01:58:13,941
"When every word begins with 'I'
the world won't resolve to rectify"

2110
01:58:14,024 --> 01:58:18,733
"Shout your slogan as 'we' and parade
Protest to put your point across; persuade"

2111
01:58:18,759 --> 01:58:22,321
"You are the rebel with a cause, comrade"

2112
01:58:22,358 --> 01:58:26,720
"Tomorrow is ours, never to fade"

2113
01:58:26,774 --> 01:58:28,108
Their behavior is atrocious, sir

2114
01:58:28,149 --> 01:58:30,399
It is my duty to inform you
and I have done my duty

2115
01:58:32,378 --> 01:58:34,517
We've come here to act for money

2116
01:58:34,540 --> 01:58:37,733
Being the local village officer
why are you reporting to a Bombay boss?

2117
01:58:37,766 --> 01:58:39,891
I am very fond
of my kith and kin

2118
01:58:39,941 --> 01:58:41,566
But my loyalty is only to my boss

2119
01:58:41,608 --> 01:58:46,691
"Won't times change in our favor?
Won't the scenario turn as a make over?"

2120
01:58:46,733 --> 01:58:51,233
"If united we stand in compliance
won't ruling party change hands?"

2121
01:58:51,274 --> 01:58:55,733
"Won't our life tide over this sadness?
Won't our gloom give way to gladness?"

2122
01:58:55,774 --> 01:59:00,524
"If we are the change per se
won't everything change anyway?"

2123
01:59:00,566 --> 01:59:04,917
"You are the rebel with a cause, comrade"

2124
01:59:09,733 --> 01:59:15,253
"Tomorrow is ours, for sure it won't fade"

2125
01:59:19,088 --> 01:59:21,255
Let them shoot in any language

2126
01:59:21,317 --> 01:59:22,817
I am the hero
That's for sure

2127
01:59:27,615 --> 01:59:28,782
1 minute
I'll call you back

2128
01:59:28,825 --> 01:59:33,142
Get up, why do you always
act coy in front of me?

2129
01:59:33,191 --> 01:59:37,353
KTV channel showcased
'Thotti Jaya' last week

2130
01:59:37,399 --> 01:59:39,321
I dozed off watching it

2131
01:59:39,358 --> 01:59:43,298
Just like in that film
I had a dream I got trapped too

2132
01:59:43,354 --> 01:59:46,646
My knight in shining armor
came and saved me, huh?

2133
01:59:46,758 --> 01:59:49,592
I lost my heart to him
that very minute!

2134
01:59:50,191 --> 01:59:52,142
Hero of 'Thotti Jaya' is Simbu, right?

2135
01:59:52,191 --> 01:59:54,608
You should feel shy and smile
like this looking at him, no?

2136
01:59:54,643 --> 01:59:58,228
I was playing Gopika's role in the dream

2137
01:59:58,274 --> 02:00:01,743
And weren't you in Simbu's shoes?

2138
02:00:41,084 --> 02:00:43,834
'Then shouldn't I feel shy
looking at you?'

2139
02:00:48,233 --> 02:00:49,795
Hey! Careful

2140
02:00:57,013 --> 02:00:59,441
If you have his welfare at heart...

2141
02:01:01,399 --> 02:01:03,441
...bring him to the venue of my choice

2142
02:01:05,191 --> 02:01:07,136
He should not file his nomination

2143
02:01:07,189 --> 02:01:08,481
Okay, sir

2144
02:01:15,988 --> 02:01:17,488
'Why are you taking this route?'

2145
02:01:17,537 --> 02:01:19,912
It's very windy, trees would
have fallen blocking the road

2146
02:01:19,945 --> 02:01:23,876
Mr Astrologer pro! If you had taken
the main road, we would've reached

2147
02:01:23,901 --> 02:01:26,151
Is he new to town?
Doesn't he know?

2148
02:01:26,202 --> 02:01:27,452
You drive, da

2149
02:01:35,319 --> 02:01:36,860
Why has a post fallen down?

2150
02:01:36,899 --> 02:01:39,274
No one should get down
till I tell you to

2151
02:01:39,299 --> 02:01:40,716
That goes for you too

2152
02:01:44,024 --> 02:01:45,441
Hey! Sit down

2153
02:01:46,185 --> 02:01:47,685
I said 'sit down'

2154
02:01:51,839 --> 02:01:53,604
I think something wrong
is about to happen

2155
02:01:53,733 --> 02:01:55,858
- Nothing of that sort
- His gut feeling is right

2156
02:01:55,899 --> 02:01:57,524
What do you mean?

2157
02:01:57,855 --> 02:01:59,483
They have planned to kill Thamizh

2158
02:01:59,524 --> 02:02:00,983
How do you know?

2159
02:02:01,024 --> 02:02:02,691
They asked me to bring him here

2160
02:02:02,769 --> 02:02:03,936
What the hell?!

2161
02:02:03,983 --> 02:02:05,535
I informed Thamizh

2162
02:02:05,585 --> 02:02:07,168
He knew and still came, huh?

2163
02:02:29,066 --> 02:02:32,060
"His foreboding blows unloading
See the sparks in his eyes exploding?"

2164
02:02:32,085 --> 02:02:34,818
"Tuck your tail, pipe down
He’ll swing you mid-air all around"

2165
02:02:34,843 --> 02:02:37,591
"His death blow; you're no more
His iron grip as never before"

2166
02:02:37,616 --> 02:02:40,917
"Why mess with him now?
Try and escape somehow"

2167
02:03:40,347 --> 02:03:43,254
"His foreboding blows unloading
See the sparks in his eyes exploding?"

2168
02:03:43,279 --> 02:03:46,089
"Tuck your tail, pipe down
He’ll swing you mid-air all around"

2169
02:03:46,128 --> 02:03:49,081
"His death blow; you're no more
His iron grip as never before"

2170
02:03:49,134 --> 02:03:51,697
"Why buy trouble now?
Try and escape somehow"

2171
02:04:27,686 --> 02:04:29,686
I have to go file my nomination

2172
02:04:30,355 --> 02:04:33,992
My grandma told me not to leave home
at an inauspicious hour, won't augur well

2173
02:04:34,024 --> 02:04:36,332
Only Yama, Lord of Death
chooses the inauspicious hour

2174
02:04:36,358 --> 02:04:39,108
- So shouldn't you have been careful?
- Sorry, sir

2175
02:04:40,546 --> 02:04:42,588
- Take them back home safe
- Okay, sir

2176
02:05:07,154 --> 02:05:08,237
Bro

2177
02:05:09,498 --> 02:05:10,706
'How is that?'

2178
02:05:11,070 --> 02:05:12,422
"Watch his style"

2179
02:05:13,711 --> 02:05:16,038
"His walk, dress, grip on parasol
Watch his style"

2180
02:05:16,062 --> 02:05:18,538
"Everyone trembles in fear"

2181
02:05:18,875 --> 02:05:21,461
"He threatens one and all in 5th gear"

2182
02:05:21,500 --> 02:05:24,383
"His name and fame creating history
in every (wo)man’s lips as a story"

2183
02:05:24,429 --> 02:05:27,812
"Residing in our hearts for eternity
Our ‘people’s treasure’ is his identity"

2184
02:05:28,328 --> 02:05:32,277
Hello, Kuzhandhai, true to your name
you are behaving like an imbecile kid

2185
02:05:32,318 --> 02:05:34,582
I underestimated you

2186
02:05:34,608 --> 02:05:37,108
You are slightly intelligent I must agree

2187
02:05:37,237 --> 02:05:40,487
I am not a villain in films
the way you seem to think

2188
02:05:40,612 --> 02:05:44,269
Are you wondering why
I am mentioning 'films'

2189
02:05:44,394 --> 02:05:47,722
I know who you are and
the aces tucked up your sleeve

2190
02:05:47,765 --> 02:05:49,224
From A to Z

2191
02:05:50,394 --> 02:05:52,608
How are you, Murugan?

2192
02:05:52,639 --> 02:05:54,180
Get lost, man!

2193
02:05:54,508 --> 02:05:56,383
If you had asked me
when I came to see you

2194
02:05:56,425 --> 02:05:59,597
...I would've myself told you A to Z
and given my Govt ID in your hands

2195
02:05:59,652 --> 02:06:01,824
Instead you think you're Poirot

2196
02:06:02,746 --> 02:06:04,302
Asking me 'How are you, Murugan?'

2197
02:06:04,344 --> 02:06:06,073
What is this act, huh?

2198
02:06:06,140 --> 02:06:08,265
You really have a silver tongue

2199
02:06:09,941 --> 02:06:14,649
Even the Smart Alec Thamizh couldn't
cope with my political moves

2200
02:06:14,691 --> 02:06:17,035
You're just an ordinary actor

2201
02:06:17,082 --> 02:06:20,233
As far as you're concerned
politics is money, power and authority

2202
02:06:20,274 --> 02:06:23,274
But to me it is duty,
responsibility and trust

2203
02:06:24,578 --> 02:06:25,953
Shall we see which wins?

2204
02:06:26,057 --> 02:06:31,035
Whether your authority or
the trust these people have in me?

2205
02:06:31,289 --> 02:06:32,873
Escort this kiddo Kuzhandhai home

2206
02:06:32,936 --> 02:06:34,471
We'll meet in the arena!

2207
02:06:34,526 --> 02:06:35,822
"Admire his style"

2208
02:06:37,033 --> 02:06:39,440
"His walk, dress, grip on parasol
Watch his style"

2209
02:06:39,470 --> 02:06:42,121
"Everyone trembles in fear"

2210
02:06:42,596 --> 02:06:45,948
'Cast your vote
on chair symbol'

2211
02:06:45,996 --> 02:06:48,463
'Let your support be
for chair symbol only'

2212
02:06:48,488 --> 02:06:52,027
'Whatever the circumstances
even if I lose my life'

2213
02:06:52,060 --> 02:06:55,226
'...I won't allow that factory
to be constructed in this soil'

2214
02:06:56,299 --> 02:07:01,933
'But a huge conspiracy is going on
to build that factory in our town'

2215
02:07:02,168 --> 02:07:04,910
'The person you look up to as God'

2216
02:07:04,945 --> 02:07:08,487
'...that Thamizh is planning
to destroy your lives'

2217
02:07:08,894 --> 02:07:11,261
'Where was Thamizh all these months?'

2218
02:07:11,311 --> 02:07:12,644
'What was he up to?'

2219
02:07:12,683 --> 02:07:15,529
'He has a girl tagging along with him'

2220
02:07:15,878 --> 02:07:17,410
'Do you know who she is?'

2221
02:07:17,464 --> 02:07:23,925
'None other than the daughter of
the factory owner wanting to destroy us'

2222
02:07:23,972 --> 02:07:25,196
'Kamalini'

2223
02:07:25,238 --> 02:07:27,035
'Last but not the least
let me assure you'

2224
02:07:27,071 --> 02:07:31,136
'I won't let down the trust you've placed
in me all these years, my dear people'

2225
02:07:31,201 --> 02:07:32,826
I shouldn't have come here

2226
02:07:32,873 --> 02:07:34,406
You're being hassled
only because of me

2227
02:07:34,431 --> 02:07:35,508
Nothing of that sort

2228
02:07:35,988 --> 02:07:37,016
You are not to blame

2229
02:07:37,041 --> 02:07:38,071
He dug his own grave

2230
02:07:38,113 --> 02:07:40,245
Promising to lay roads,
dig up ponds, distribute water

2231
02:07:40,270 --> 02:07:42,654
...will the opposition sit quiet?
He will strike back

2232
02:07:42,832 --> 02:07:44,821
So should this town stagnate like this?

2233
02:07:44,863 --> 02:07:47,113
Seeing the people's reaction
looks like we are in danger

2234
02:07:47,155 --> 02:07:49,918
Before they turn violent let's apologize
and leave this place silently

2235
02:07:50,136 --> 02:07:52,186
And where do we go?

2236
02:07:52,211 --> 02:07:54,170
They've come trusting us
We have to respond

2237
02:07:54,214 --> 02:07:55,886
What is our reply?

2238
02:07:56,910 --> 02:07:57,941
Life or death

2239
02:07:57,966 --> 02:07:59,324
Let my people decide

2240
02:07:59,440 --> 02:08:00,523
No need, don't go

2241
02:08:05,137 --> 02:08:08,803
Thamizh, I believe your girlfriend
is the daughter of that factory owner

2242
02:08:08,845 --> 02:08:10,887
Kuzhandhai is announcing this
all over our town

2243
02:08:10,928 --> 02:08:13,970
You intend marrying her it seems
and the factory will be built here

2244
02:08:14,012 --> 02:08:17,595
We are not suspicious of you, Thamizh

2245
02:08:18,183 --> 02:08:19,808
You are like a son to all of us

2246
02:08:19,848 --> 02:08:22,043
'How will we doubt our own child?'

2247
02:08:22,079 --> 02:08:24,503
How will you have the heart
to backstab us, bro?

2248
02:08:24,699 --> 02:08:27,720
If a factory is constructed here
because of you and we die

2249
02:08:27,762 --> 02:08:29,553
...we'll consider it a privilege, son

2250
02:08:29,595 --> 02:08:31,553
- Bro...please
- 'Listen, Thamizh'

2251
02:08:31,595 --> 02:08:33,972
People will tend to gossip
adding 4 + 4 as 5

2252
02:08:34,012 --> 02:08:36,053
'Don't take it to heart'

2253
02:08:36,207 --> 02:08:38,915
We wanted to assure you to be strong

2254
02:08:38,970 --> 02:08:41,845
And tell you we are with you
What do you say?

2255
02:08:41,887 --> 02:08:42,970
Yes

2256
02:08:51,887 --> 02:08:54,019
Your daughter's problem
is the talk of the town

2257
02:08:54,558 --> 02:08:57,425
Sir, if the case is not
withdrawn this time

2258
02:08:57,462 --> 02:08:59,087
...the stay is confirmed, sir

2259
02:09:07,859 --> 02:09:08,985
Tell me, Vinoth

2260
02:09:09,067 --> 02:09:12,734
Thamizh anna, the children in this school
who ate the midday meal have been poisoned

2261
02:09:12,776 --> 02:09:14,109
'I'm so scared
Come soon, bro'

2262
02:09:14,192 --> 02:09:15,317
Hey! Where?

2263
02:09:15,985 --> 02:09:17,359
Give me a hand

2264
02:09:17,442 --> 02:09:18,734
Give me this child, bro

2265
02:09:19,150 --> 02:09:21,609
- Go there
- Check what's happening

2266
02:09:22,109 --> 02:09:23,526
Hurry up

2267
02:09:30,568 --> 02:09:35,818
I heard some kids in the school
are suffering from food poisoning

2268
02:09:36,067 --> 02:09:37,484
'Somehow I think'

2269
02:09:37,526 --> 02:09:40,526
...someone must have
mixed poison in the eggs

2270
02:09:40,568 --> 02:09:43,526
Hey! They are innocent children-

2271
02:09:45,359 --> 02:09:47,359
No time to rebuke me

2272
02:09:47,442 --> 02:09:49,150
Pick the call on the 2nd line

2273
02:09:49,985 --> 02:09:51,234
- Hello
- 'Bro...!'

2274
02:09:51,317 --> 02:09:54,484
'Patients in the hospital are
vomiting blood, come soon, bro'

2275
02:09:54,526 --> 02:09:56,359
- I'm coming
- 'Come soon'

2276
02:09:56,401 --> 02:09:57,568
You go, I'll handle this

2277
02:09:58,150 --> 02:09:59,276
- Rush
- Move aside

2278
02:10:00,234 --> 02:10:02,484
Thamizh anna
Hurry up, bro

2279
02:10:05,859 --> 02:10:07,526
Come...come and see

2280
02:10:07,568 --> 02:10:08,901
Look at this pathetic plight

2281
02:10:25,067 --> 02:10:27,526
'This morning children were poisoned'

2282
02:10:27,568 --> 02:10:29,067
Now adults share the same fate

2283
02:10:29,109 --> 02:10:31,651
I hope your equipment list was
all good to take them to safety

2284
02:10:31,693 --> 02:10:33,317
Then they can be saved

2285
02:10:33,484 --> 02:10:35,317
'Pick up your 2nd line'

2286
02:10:36,693 --> 02:10:38,276
'Thamizh anna, come soon

2287
02:10:38,317 --> 02:10:39,776
Our town bus had an accident'

2288
02:10:39,818 --> 02:10:40,901
- Highway, bro
- I'm coming

2289
02:10:56,526 --> 02:10:58,150
Please bear the pain, ma

2290
02:11:37,859 --> 02:11:39,401
It's alright, ma

2291
02:11:50,067 --> 02:11:52,234
I believe there was
an accident on the highway

2292
02:11:52,276 --> 02:11:53,818
Hope there were no casualties

2293
02:11:53,859 --> 02:11:55,818
We need only 1 finger, right?

2294
02:11:56,401 --> 02:11:57,818
To cast a vote in my favor!

2295
02:11:57,901 --> 02:11:59,818
'I think this is enough for now'

2296
02:12:06,859 --> 02:12:09,150
Sir, just 1 question

2297
02:12:57,693 --> 02:12:59,442
- Your shirt is torn
- Blood stains

2298
02:13:00,526 --> 02:13:01,693
Aiyaiyo!
Listen, everyone

2299
02:13:01,734 --> 02:13:04,150
Thamizh has hacked
our leader's arm

2300
02:13:04,234 --> 02:13:06,109
- Come and help
- Move aside

2301
02:13:06,150 --> 02:13:07,943
I'm alright
Don't worry

2302
02:13:09,234 --> 02:13:13,734
I strongly condemn the atrocity meted out
to my party candidate Kuzhandhaivel

2303
02:13:13,776 --> 02:13:17,734
Should the opposition go to the extent
of murder fearing defeat in the election?

2304
02:13:17,776 --> 02:13:23,401
The police force should immediately
arrest independent candidate Thamizh

2305
02:13:23,484 --> 02:13:27,401
He has shed his blood and sweat
for Maruthamangalam constituency

2306
02:13:27,442 --> 02:13:32,067
He will recover and work for the welfare
of the people and his constituency

2307
02:13:32,776 --> 02:13:35,401
Bro, confirmed, we will ace this election

2308
02:13:36,859 --> 02:13:40,818
'The by-election in Maruthamalai
is due within the next few days'

2309
02:13:40,859 --> 02:13:44,859
'Mr Kuzhandhaivel, ex-MLA and
candidate of People's Progressive Party'

2310
02:13:44,901 --> 02:13:48,776
'...has been assaulted in his residence
by Sangathamizhan, his opposing candidate'

2311
02:13:48,818 --> 02:13:49,943
'Vanakkam, sir'

2312
02:13:49,985 --> 02:13:52,901
You've become talk of the town
in 1 day, Kuzhandhai?

2313
02:13:52,943 --> 02:13:54,693
It is your blessings, leader

2314
02:13:54,734 --> 02:13:56,109
'He acted rashly on impulse'

2315
02:13:56,150 --> 02:13:57,776
Thank your stars
it works in your favour

2316
02:13:57,818 --> 02:13:58,818
Yes, sir

2317
02:14:00,901 --> 02:14:03,359
What is your conflict
with ex-MLA Kuzhandhaivel?

2318
02:14:03,442 --> 02:14:05,484
'Why did you attempt to kill him?'

2319
02:14:08,734 --> 02:14:11,568
Only now I feel I'm seeing
the Thamizh I know

2320
02:14:11,776 --> 02:14:12,985
Murugan!

2321
02:14:13,442 --> 02:14:15,317
You have a problem
confront me directly

2322
02:14:15,359 --> 02:14:16,943
What did those poor people do?

2323
02:14:17,067 --> 02:14:19,192
Showing your bravery on
innocent children and elders

2324
02:14:19,234 --> 02:14:21,192
- Aren't you ashamed?
- What can I do?

2325
02:14:21,234 --> 02:14:23,859
Those brainless people trust you

2326
02:14:24,150 --> 02:14:25,693
I decided right then

2327
02:14:25,734 --> 02:14:27,693
I should not target you

2328
02:14:27,734 --> 02:14:29,609
But aim at those people

2329
02:14:30,734 --> 02:14:33,568
If you want to protect
the welfare of the people

2330
02:14:33,568 --> 02:14:37,568
...withdraw your nomination
and leave this town at once

2331
02:14:37,943 --> 02:14:40,109
I can slit your neck
this very minute

2332
02:14:41,109 --> 02:14:46,776
I will rob you of the same money, power
and authority you want to grab for yourself

2333
02:14:46,818 --> 02:14:49,901
And make you stand in the middle
of the road, want to see me do it?

2334
02:14:50,192 --> 02:14:51,693
If you call yourself a man...

2335
02:14:51,985 --> 02:14:54,693
...do whatever fraudulent dealings
you are capable of

2336
02:14:54,734 --> 02:14:56,568
And show me you can win this election

2337
02:14:57,901 --> 02:14:59,317
Meet you at the arena

2338
02:15:02,192 --> 02:15:06,776
The media witnessed you entering and
exiting in anger from the ex-MLA's house

2339
02:15:06,818 --> 02:15:08,109
Are you denying it?

2340
02:15:10,484 --> 02:15:12,651
So you will trust me
if there is strong evidence?

2341
02:15:12,693 --> 02:15:14,067
For sure, sir

2342
02:15:14,109 --> 02:15:15,901
Move aside for the police force

2343
02:15:16,776 --> 02:15:18,359
Sir, please give me
your WhatsApp #?

2344
02:15:18,401 --> 02:15:20,234
- What for?
- I have a task to complete

2345
02:15:20,276 --> 02:15:22,568
99421 98999

2346
02:15:22,609 --> 02:15:24,734
Why say it so menacingly?

2347
02:15:24,776 --> 02:15:25,818
Show some respect

2348
02:15:25,859 --> 02:15:27,359
Take a look at your phone

2349
02:15:28,276 --> 02:15:30,609
'He spoke and walked away
Why are you just gawking at him?'

2350
02:15:30,651 --> 02:15:32,609
'He barged in and chopped my arm'

2351
02:15:32,734 --> 02:15:34,276
'You are being a silent witness'

2352
02:15:34,317 --> 02:15:36,693
'The members of the Press
standing outside didn't see this'

2353
02:15:36,734 --> 02:15:37,901
'Even you didn't see it?'

2354
02:15:37,943 --> 02:15:38,943
'Chop my arm'

2355
02:15:38,985 --> 02:15:40,484
'How can I do that to you, bro?'

2356
02:15:40,526 --> 02:15:41,693
'Do as I say'

2357
02:15:51,150 --> 02:15:53,526
Hey! Our leader
Ssssh! Let me talk

2358
02:15:55,901 --> 02:15:56,943
Tell me, sir

2359
02:15:56,985 --> 02:15:58,901
Yov! What have you done?

2360
02:15:59,568 --> 02:16:02,943
- No, sir, please hear me out
- Hey! Why should I listen to you?

2361
02:16:02,985 --> 02:16:04,568
Shut up and listen to me first

2362
02:16:05,901 --> 02:16:09,568
'Kuzhandhaivel's drama
of chopping his own arm'

2363
02:16:09,609 --> 02:16:12,359
'...has created a stir
in political circles'

2364
02:16:12,401 --> 02:16:16,943
'I dismiss Kuzhandhaivel from
the Party on a permanent basis'

2365
02:16:17,317 --> 02:16:22,943
'Hereafter there's no connection whatsoever
between Kuzhandhaivel and Party volunteers'

2366
02:16:42,818 --> 02:16:44,234
'Does that terrify you?'

2367
02:16:45,442 --> 02:16:46,776
'Are you petrified?'

2368
02:16:49,651 --> 02:16:53,401
'If you toe the line and
sign the documents'

2369
02:16:53,901 --> 02:16:56,234
'...you can step out
with your life intact'

2370
02:16:56,359 --> 02:17:00,150
Otherwise I can't guarantee
for your lives at all

2371
02:17:01,901 --> 02:17:04,442
No one is around to
crash the gates and barge in

2372
02:17:04,484 --> 02:17:07,359
Thamizh who is your savior
isn't alive either

2373
02:17:08,734 --> 02:17:09,859
Sorry

2374
02:17:12,401 --> 02:17:13,401
You aren't aware, right?

2375
02:17:13,442 --> 02:17:17,109
'The man you think is Thamizh'

2376
02:17:17,484 --> 02:17:18,693
...is Murugan!

2377
02:17:18,859 --> 02:17:20,818
He is the coolie I have planted

2378
02:17:20,985 --> 02:17:22,985
He's a fantastic actor

2379
02:17:23,818 --> 02:17:27,359
He conned the whole town
He deceived his own family

2380
02:17:27,859 --> 02:17:31,109
He was even able to make
all his friends believe in his duplicity

2381
02:17:31,150 --> 02:17:32,442
Every single person

2382
02:17:33,359 --> 02:17:37,317
All - are - stupid - idiots!

2383
02:17:37,401 --> 02:17:38,943
Are we the idiots?

2384
02:17:39,150 --> 02:17:41,317
Don't let your tongue run, sir

2385
02:17:41,526 --> 02:17:44,609
You are wrong if you think he is Murugan

2386
02:17:44,651 --> 02:17:46,693
He is our Thamizh anna

2387
02:17:54,901 --> 02:17:56,067
Careful, take her

2388
02:17:56,109 --> 02:17:57,568
Kavya!

2389
02:18:20,651 --> 02:18:21,734
Anna?

2390
02:18:25,359 --> 02:18:26,985
- How are you?
- I'm good

2391
02:18:27,067 --> 02:18:28,359
How are you?

2392
02:18:29,067 --> 02:18:30,234
I'm fine

2393
02:18:30,651 --> 02:18:32,818
I've betrayed you so much, Thamizh

2394
02:18:32,943 --> 02:18:34,985
But you saved my daughter

2395
02:18:35,192 --> 02:18:37,651
I'll be loyal to you
till my last breath, Thamizh

2396
02:18:37,693 --> 02:18:39,484
Please forgive me, Thamizh

2397
02:18:39,776 --> 02:18:41,109
Take care of your child

2398
02:18:42,442 --> 02:18:43,901
You think you brought him here?

2399
02:18:43,943 --> 02:18:45,859
He came here through you!

2400
02:18:47,818 --> 02:18:48,818
'Dubai'

2401
02:18:48,859 --> 02:18:50,985
'Murugan worked with
Thamizha anna in Dubai'

2402
02:18:51,317 --> 02:18:52,568
'His friend'

2403
02:18:52,776 --> 02:18:55,526
'Thamizh anna lived as Muruga
in his house in Chennai'

2404
02:18:55,568 --> 02:18:57,359
'His family is aware of everything'

2405
02:19:00,776 --> 02:19:02,859
'He visited that pub
only to meet your daughter'

2406
02:19:03,568 --> 02:19:05,859
'He created a deep impact
in your daughter's mind'

2407
02:19:06,609 --> 02:19:09,192
- I'm really proud of you, Thamizh
- Thank you, sir

2408
02:19:11,526 --> 02:19:12,985
Take Gopi to Bombay

2409
02:19:13,693 --> 02:19:15,334
No one should suspect anything

2410
02:19:15,359 --> 02:19:16,776
I'll handle this, Thamizh

2411
02:19:18,776 --> 02:19:20,818
Instead of creating a scene
call your dad now

2412
02:19:26,526 --> 02:19:28,359
'Sangathamizhan'

2413
02:19:29,818 --> 02:19:32,943
'If he wanted to seek revenge
he could have killed you long ago'

2414
02:19:32,985 --> 02:19:35,901
'With the same legal loopholes
through which you entered'

2415
02:19:35,943 --> 02:19:38,776
'He was waiting to turn the tables on you'

2416
02:19:39,234 --> 02:19:41,776
'He returned as Sangathamizhan
to his hometown'

2417
02:19:41,818 --> 02:19:42,943
Good show

2418
02:19:46,568 --> 02:19:48,192
So if you are alive

2419
02:19:48,234 --> 02:19:50,484
...the factory won't be constructed

2420
02:19:50,693 --> 02:19:51,985
Where is Thamizh?

2421
02:19:52,317 --> 02:19:53,776
'Listen to me patiently'

2422
02:19:53,818 --> 02:19:55,985
'Think and then decide'

2423
02:19:56,234 --> 02:19:58,401
'Only if need be
lose your temper!'

2424
02:20:24,609 --> 02:20:26,776
I totally underestimated you

2425
02:20:26,859 --> 02:20:30,484
I didn't expect you to grow in stature
and stand before me so soon

2426
02:20:30,568 --> 02:20:33,526
You know if God has decided
to send someone as godsend

2427
02:20:33,859 --> 02:20:37,734
...even if you try to shut the gate
and lock it up, the lock won't work!

2428
02:20:38,067 --> 02:20:39,109
'Want to know why?'

2429
02:20:39,150 --> 02:20:40,859
Because HE holds the key!

2430
02:21:10,317 --> 02:21:13,359
"Hey there! Move, dude
I will rip your ears into two"

2431
02:21:13,401 --> 02:21:16,442
"Who came spoiling for a fight?
I'm king of blows; to wrong the right"

2432
02:21:16,484 --> 02:21:17,943
"Eruptive
Explosive"

2433
02:21:17,985 --> 02:21:20,985
"Even fear will flee; terrified
with a glimpse of him, petrified"

2434
02:22:33,150 --> 02:22:35,359
Will you sign at least now?

2435
02:22:35,901 --> 02:22:38,818
Or shall I kill you and then
use your thumbprints?

2436
02:23:38,776 --> 02:23:39,901
Anna...!

2437
02:23:42,609 --> 02:23:43,609
Let go

2438
02:23:43,734 --> 02:23:44,818
I'm alright

2439
02:23:44,943 --> 02:23:46,234
Come

2440
02:23:48,067 --> 02:23:49,401
What the hell?

2441
02:24:14,568 --> 02:24:15,568
Hey!

2442
02:24:16,067 --> 02:24:19,234
You backstabbed your homeland and
your own people for some random stranger

2443
02:24:19,276 --> 02:24:20,818
It's a sin to even touch you

2444
02:24:21,067 --> 02:24:22,150
Come on

2445
02:24:22,359 --> 02:24:24,150
'In the given time
allotted by the Court'

2446
02:24:24,192 --> 02:24:29,401
'Since Sanjay Industries was
unable to justify its actions'

2447
02:24:29,484 --> 02:24:31,401
'And based on inquiries'

2448
02:24:31,442 --> 02:24:34,943
'...it has been proved beyond doubt
this copper factory will pollute'

2449
02:24:34,985 --> 02:24:37,234
'...the environment and surroundings'

2450
02:24:37,442 --> 02:24:40,985
'Any industrial firm should function
only for the welfare of the people'

2451
02:24:41,067 --> 02:24:45,901
'Bearing in mind it should not be
for the personal gain of any individual'

2452
02:24:45,943 --> 02:24:50,359
'...this Court has banned operations
of Sanjay Industries on a permanent basis'

2453
02:24:50,442 --> 02:24:56,442
'Further the Court orders the owner to
return land(s) acquired from individuals'

2454
02:25:01,901 --> 02:25:04,067
'What is your comment on your victory?'

2455
02:25:04,109 --> 02:25:05,985
This isn't an individual's victory

2456
02:25:06,067 --> 02:25:08,317
This is the reward
for the unity of my people

2457
02:25:09,776 --> 02:25:13,609
Having enforced a ban here, can you
affirm the same even in Tamil Nadu?

2458
02:25:13,651 --> 02:25:15,317
I am not an astrologer!

2459
02:25:15,693 --> 02:25:18,901
If the people in other cities and towns
are as united as my people here

2460
02:25:18,943 --> 02:25:20,693
...they will get only what they aspire for

2461
02:25:20,734 --> 02:25:22,985
I believe no one can thrust
what they don't like

2462
02:25:23,109 --> 02:25:25,734
Are you implying political heads
duly elected by the people

2463
02:25:25,776 --> 02:25:27,651
...are committing these crimes?

2464
02:25:29,442 --> 02:25:33,359
I feel there is no use pointing fingers
at who is right and who is wrong

2465
02:25:33,526 --> 02:25:35,526
Because if that is our intention

2466
02:25:35,776 --> 02:25:38,359
...we can do it lifelong
It doesn't give room for progress

2467
02:25:38,401 --> 02:25:39,859
So what are you trying to say?

2468
02:25:39,901 --> 02:25:42,901
I have a lot of work to catch up on
Let me attend to it, thank you

2469
02:25:43,109 --> 02:25:44,234
Vanakkam

2470
02:25:44,651 --> 02:25:46,317
Muruga, how are you?

2471
02:25:46,359 --> 02:25:47,818
Thamizh, you achieved it!

2472
02:25:48,401 --> 02:25:50,526
I should really thank you
Thank you very much

2473
02:25:50,568 --> 02:25:53,401
Not only did he fool me
but tricked you too, right?

2474
02:25:53,526 --> 02:25:54,568
He didn't fool me

2475
02:25:54,609 --> 02:25:55,693
Height of loyalty!

2476
02:25:58,859 --> 02:26:00,901
You love me
That's true, right?

2477
02:26:07,276 --> 02:26:09,192
Do what your heart tells you, Thamizh

2478
02:26:09,276 --> 02:26:10,442
I'm there for you

2479
02:26:12,568 --> 02:26:13,985
You achieved your goal

2480
02:26:14,067 --> 02:26:16,150
- How are you, bro-in-law?
- So proud of you

2481
02:26:16,943 --> 02:26:18,192
Keep chatting, I'll be back

2482
02:26:18,234 --> 02:26:20,651
- Okay, Mr Gambler?
- Very happy indeed!

2483
02:26:21,734 --> 02:26:24,192
Wow!

2484
02:26:24,901 --> 02:26:29,192
How did you accomplish all you had to
and now you stand here so silently?

2485
02:26:30,192 --> 02:26:32,150
Don't pull cuss words out of my mouth!

2486
02:26:32,192 --> 02:26:34,609
You kept projecting me as hero
and you grabbed the title!

2487
02:26:34,651 --> 02:26:36,985
Don't jump to conclusions
based on what happened here

2488
02:26:37,067 --> 02:26:39,526
You're always my hero and
I'm the comedian by your side

2489
02:26:39,568 --> 02:26:41,568
- Tell him
- Go to hell!

2490
02:26:41,609 --> 02:26:43,734
I'll stick to comedy
till the very end

2491
02:26:43,818 --> 02:26:45,442
Our combo is a successful one

2492
02:26:45,484 --> 02:26:46,609
Don't desert me, sir

2493
02:26:46,901 --> 02:26:48,359
Sir...sir

2494
02:26:48,401 --> 02:26:49,651
