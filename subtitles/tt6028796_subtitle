1
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:00,166
Ma'am.

2
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:03,291
-Is this alright?
-No. A little more towards the right.

3
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:10,208
Vasudha.

4
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:11,625
Lata, come here.

5
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:13,000
She is my wife.

6
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:15,291
-What is it?
-You are needed in the kitchen.

7
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:16,208
Alright.

8
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:18,000
Did Ramesh get his coffee yet?

9
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:31,083
Don't use up all the cashews and almonds.
They are expensive.

10
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:32,750
-Okay, sir.
-What is it?

11
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,500
Vasu, where were you?

12
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,208
Spare some time for this as well.

13
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:37,666
I can't be everywhere.

14
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:40,583
Is he coming?

15
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:42,708
Yes.

16
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:45,375
Will he make it here on time?

17
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:49,208
I hope he does. Or else, the guests
will arrive before the host shows up.

18
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:52,291
What are you waiting for?
Go and fetch my new stole.

19
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:56,791
Why haven't the musicians started
playing the instruments yet?

20
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,291
Someone, please go and check!

21
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:03,000
Ramesh, please go and
check on the musicians.

22
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,416
Sister-in-law!

23
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:07,208
Look!

24
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:08,833
-Please set this right.
-Yes.

25
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:09,958
-Vasu.
-Yes?

26
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:10,916
The stole?

27
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:14,500
You're taking so much time
for such a simple task.

28
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:17,750
I'll get it.

29
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:21,291
I know you are very busy.

30
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:25,291
But that idiot Chitra
messed up my saree pleats.

31
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:27,000
Sister-in-law.

32
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:29,791
You know how to drape a saree really well.

33
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:32,041
Welcome.

34
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:34,166
Welcome.

35
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:36,208
-Welcome.
-Greetings.

36
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:37,958
-Hello.
-Greetings.

37
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:43,458
-Make sure everything is alright.
-Sure.

38
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,791
I got into the cab just now.

39
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:07,625
The flight was delayed, and...

40
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:09,500
Yes.

41
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,666
You know how my father is.

42
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:18,708
I'm going home only for
the sake of my mother.

43
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:21,916
After four long years.

44
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,333
Kartik!

45
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:46,583
Hello, Uncle Ramesh.

46
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:52,833
-You are so--
-Handsome! More than ever!

47
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:53,916
Where is Mom?

48
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,750
Forget about her. Just come in.

49
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:58,083
Someone's waiting for you.

50
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:00,541
-Mom, right?
-Just come.

51
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:05,458
Who are these people?

52
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:09,083
Kartik, stop questioning.
Please greet the guests.

53
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:11,250
Bless you.

54
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,833
The last time I saw you,
you were just a baby.

55
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:16,416
You are all grown up now.

56
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,208
Oh, no!

57
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:26,041
Kartik, didn't you recognize her?

58
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:34,583
Kartik, you used to play with her
at Uncle Velu's house.

59
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:35,583
Remember?

60
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,125
Neela?

61
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:38,750
Kartik!

62
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:47,791
My family forced me to dress up.

63
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:49,750
Especially, for today.

64
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,458
For today?

65
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,625
Why?

66
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:54,541
We both have to...

67
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:57,083
What?

68
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:58,666
We want you guys to get
married to each other.

69
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:02,416
And it seems like you already like Neela.

70
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:07,416
Better late than never.

71
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:09,916
Dad?

72
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,208
This...

73
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:12,958
You didn't even ask me.

74
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:15,666
A father doesn't need to
seek permission from his son.

75
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:18,333
But...

76
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:31,750
Mom.

77
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:33,541
Mom.

78
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:49,541
You arrived 20 minutes ago.

79
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:52,166
And you finally got the time to meet me.

80
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:54,541
I wanted to meet you right away.

81
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:56,666
But Dad had something else planned.

82
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,500
What was that all about?
I don't want to get married.

83
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:04,250
You are here for the religious ceremony.
That's all.

84
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,083
Will Dad spare me?

85
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:09,541
He hasn't changed a bit.

86
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:12,416
You are still the same.

87
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:14,750
Why are you the only one
doing all the housework?

88
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:16,750
Can't Auntie Lata or Auntie Sarita help?

89
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,958
They help me sometimes.

90
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:20,958
Let me help you.

91
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:24,666
You can't touch it before taking a bath.

92
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,291
I won't touch the bucket.
Let me help you with the rope.

93
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:38,500
All through these years,
I had an image of you in my mind.

94
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:42,541
Finally, I get to see you in person.

95
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:45,791
I missed you a lot, Mom!

96
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,291
That's why I called you every day.

97
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:50,458
Why didn't you come home?

98
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:54,958
Any career plans for the future?

99
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:58,166
Dad, I have a job

100
00:07:58,333 --> 00:07:59,166
in Mumbai.

101
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:00,208
Really?

102
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:04,208
Roaming around all day with a camera.

103
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:05,750
You call that a job?

104
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:07,833
I'm a professional photographer.

105
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:10,666
-Really?
-Let him be.

106
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:12,416
He's happy.

107
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,083
He's doing well for himself.

108
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:15,791
Doing well?

109
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:17,625
How much does he earn?

110
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:20,458
Does he have any job security?
Will he ever get a promotion?

111
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:23,500
I've told him many times.

112
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:26,083
There's a post of a computer operator
at my office.

113
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:29,208
He must go there for an interview.
He hasn't done that yet.

114
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:32,750
-But a computer operator's job--
-If you had a government job...

115
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:35,291
you could have married a good girl.

116
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:37,583
You could have led a
secure and happy life.

117
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:39,083
But, you...

118
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,875
Mom, please make him understand.

119
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:45,125
I can't do a nine-to-five job like him.

120
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,416
He is up to no good.

121
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:51,666
He's been living in Mumbai,
away from his hometown.

122
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,958
Make him understand.

123
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:55,750
I've decided.

124
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:58,291
We'll marry him off by next year.

125
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,375
-Dad, I--
-Shut up.

126
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:02,625
I don't want to discuss this any further.

127
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:06,791
Take the bucket.

128
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:11,833
Oh, yes.

129
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:14,333
I need to show you something.

130
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:15,458
-What?
-Come with me.

131
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:17,625
Look at this.

132
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:20,291
Remember? I told you over the phone.

133
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:25,333
-So, this is it!
-Yes.

134
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,750
Yes, the same seeds we
bought from the nursery.

135
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:31,458
See how well the plants have grown
and flowered.

136
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:32,833
So soon?

137
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:34,625
Not that soon, my dear.

138
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:36,708
After 4 long years!

139
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,875
Sorry, Mom.

140
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:48,000
-I have to take this call.
-Sure.

141
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:49,625
Answer the call.

142
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,041
I'll get going.

143
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:53,875
Answer it.

144
00:09:56,791 --> 00:10:00,208
I used to think that only mothers
could call at the wrong time.

145
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:01,541
Reached home?

146
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:06,541
Yes. But you won't believe
what's going on here.

147
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:10,875
I came here for the religious ceremony.
But my father wants to get me married now.

148
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:14,208
So, get married.

149
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:16,000
Yeah, right.

150
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,166
That will never happen.

151
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,791
Suddenly, I'm feeling lost.

152
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:33,333
A few hours ago, I was with you
at our cozy home in Mumbai.

153
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:34,708
And now, I'm here.

154
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:39,083
I'm far away from you,
amidst so many people.

155
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:54,208
Now go and spend some
time with your family.

156
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:31,583
You?

157
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:34,500
I'm not following you.

158
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:35,583
Well...

159
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:39,583
Actually, I got bored
with the elders inside.

160
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:42,125
So, I came out for a walk.

161
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,541
What's that?

162
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,000
I have secrets as well.

163
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:54,958
And a childhood crush.

164
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,625
What about your childhood crush?

165
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:00,041
-Let me see.
-No!

166
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:14,000
I don't want to hurt you. But...

167
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:16,916
Arranged marriages...

168
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,833
I'm not interested in arranged marriages.

169
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:22,583
In fact, I don't even want to get married.

170
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:31,500
Please stop.

171
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:34,750
Kartik, have you brought your camera?

172
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,750
Get it here. Click some pictures.

173
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:39,708
Do I always have to instruct you?

174
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:44,083
Dad, I thought you didn't...

175
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:49,208
Please carry on.

176
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:42,666
It will be presented to God
before you can eat it.

177
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:45,875
Mom, I didn't do anything.

178
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:49,875
Really? I think you were about to grab it.

179
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,791
Mom, your eyes are closed.
How did you know?

180
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:57,416
I know it all.

181
00:13:57,791 --> 00:13:58,708
Really?

182
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,833
Vasu, where is the stole that
we need to give to the priest?

183
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:28,125
-It must be inside. I'll get it--
-Why isn't it here?

184
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:30,375
It should have been here.

185
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:32,250
Right?

186
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:34,583
She is very absentminded.

187
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,208
-Brother, I'll get it--
-Stay right there.

188
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:39,625
Let her get it.

189
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:43,958
What are you waiting for?

190
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:04,375
Lata, let's go.

191
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:06,333
Kartik, we are leaving.

192
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:08,041
You don't need to do that.

193
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,625
Let's hug.

194
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:13,625
-You are looking very hot.
-Uncle Ramesh!

195
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:18,625
Please come home. I live nearby.

196
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:22,083
-Let's catch up--
-Yes, Ramesh. We'll be there.

197
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:24,458
Give him a few tips...

198
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:26,625
for a happy married life like yours.

199
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:28,208
Spoilt brat!

200
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:29,333
Sure.

201
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:31,166
You must come home.

202
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:33,291
-Kartik.
-Yes?

203
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:38,750
Lata, let's go.

204
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:41,250
-Goodbye.
-See you, Ramesh.

205
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:42,750
Bye.

206
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:48,666
So, what have you decided?

207
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:50,625
Nothing.

208
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:52,416
-Auntie Sarita, who is this?
-She--

209
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,916
I've asked you a question.

210
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:57,291
Tell me. Do you like Neela?

211
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:03,291
Dad, why did you invite her?

212
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:04,625
Brother...

213
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:08,291
A marriage should not
be arranged by force.

214
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:14,083
One who hasn't been able to manage
her own marriage and home...

215
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:16,041
should better keep quiet.

216
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:19,416
This is my house.

217
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:23,666
I don't need anyone's advice.

218
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,958
Do you like Neela?

219
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:44,000
You need to think about settling down.

220
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:48,000
She is beautiful and educated.

221
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:49,916
She belongs to a good family.

222
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:51,458
What's the problem?

223
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,625
Dad, you won't understand.

224
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:55,416
You are too selfish to understand me.

225
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:57,208
-Son!
-No, Vasu.

226
00:16:57,833 --> 00:16:58,875
Let him speak.

227
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:00,958
He thinks that I'm his enemy.

228
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:03,250
That I have no right to
think about his well-being.

229
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:05,666
Dad, I didn't mean that.

230
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:10,041
Marrying at the right age means
having a child at the right time.

231
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:14,333
By the time a father retires,
his son ought to have a job.

232
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:16,750
He needs to take on the
family's responsibilities.

233
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,166
Can't you understand such a simple thing?

234
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:22,000
Sorry, Dad.
Marriage is not a simple thing to me.

235
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,458
It's a lifelong commitment.

236
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:28,833
-It is possible only with love.
-Really?

237
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:31,875
I didn't even meet your mother
before our wedding.

238
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:34,833
I just saw her photo and gave my consent.

239
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:37,125
We are happily married.

240
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:43,000
I fulfilled all my responsibilities.

241
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,083
I got a job.

242
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:46,666
I helped my siblings with their education.

243
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,291
I got them married.

244
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:49,250
I married your mother.

245
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:53,875
I didn't waste my time being
a photographer in Mumbai.

246
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:58,666
I thought you'll get a little
more responsible with time.

247
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:03,583
Where are you going?

248
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,041
I'm talking to you.

249
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:09,708
You won't find a girl like her again.

250
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:12,458
Neela is a very good girl.

251
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:14,458
Why don't you marry her?

252
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:27,541
<span style="style.default_1">She flows</span>

253
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:32,333
<span style="style.default_1">She bears</span>

254
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:37,625
<span style="style.default_1">She flows</span>

255
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,541
<span style="style.default_1">She bears</span>

256
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:50,458
<span style="style.default_1">She never speaks her mind</span>

257
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:57,625
<span style="style.default_1">She is trapped</span>

258
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:59,541
<span style="style.default_1">Like a river</span>

259
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:05,250
<span style="style.default_1">That doesn't get to decide its own flow</span>

260
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:11,708
<span style="style.default_1">She flows</span>

261
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:15,291
<span style="style.default_1">She bears</span>

262
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:43,416
<span style="style.default_1">My heart</span>

263
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:51,958
<span style="style.default_1">My heart</span>

264
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:56,708
<span style="style.default_1">My heart longs for you</span>

265
00:19:56,791 --> 00:20:01,666
<span style="style.default_1">Why do things have to be so complicated?</span>

266
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:06,583
<span style="style.default_1">Why do things have to be so complicated?</span>

267
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:13,750
<span style="style.default_1">These bonds of love</span>

268
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:20,541
<span style="style.default_1">She flows</span>

269
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:25,708
<span style="style.default_1">She bears</span>

270
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:03,500
Kartik.

271
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:05,500
-Uncle Ramesh.
-Why are you here?

272
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:08,708
So, what I've heard is true.

273
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:13,791
Now you are completely into this.

274
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:16,458
What do you mean?

275
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:20,458
The fact that I'm gay?

276
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:23,625
-Why are you here?
-I'm here for a walk.

277
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:25,958
I'm here for a walk.

278
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:28,916
Kartik, I am straight.

279
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:32,208
What?

280
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,333
Nothing.

281
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:36,583
Kartik, let's spend some time together.

282
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:38,625
Let's talk.

283
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:40,250
Uncle, I've got to go.

284
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:52,708
What! You're still here?

285
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:55,583
I thought you were angry.

286
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:57,375
I thought you left for Mumbai.

287
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:00,541
Mom, my luggage and camera is in there.

288
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:02,083
I see.

289
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,958
So, you've come to collect that?

290
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:11,416
Why are you busy with such manly tasks?

291
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:13,000
Get down, I'll do it.

292
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:14,000
Okay.

293
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,375
Careful.

294
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:23,583
Dad is supposed to help you with this.

295
00:22:24,166 --> 00:22:25,041
But he won't.

296
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:27,125
He is self-centered.

297
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:29,208
Why are you so angry with him?

298
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:32,291
Because he is always rude.

299
00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:34,833
I'm sure you think he is rude.

300
00:22:35,583 --> 00:22:37,500
But his intentions are good.

301
00:22:38,041 --> 00:22:40,750
Do you know why he is rude to you?

302
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:44,958
It's because he cares for you.

303
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,333
Of course.

304
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:50,416
I know your father very well.

305
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:54,958
What about him?

306
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:56,666
How well does he know...

307
00:22:57,208 --> 00:22:58,041
you?

308
00:23:02,958 --> 00:23:04,416
That's great.

309
00:23:05,666 --> 00:23:06,750
Kartik.

310
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:08,208
Have you brought your laptop here?

311
00:23:09,291 --> 00:23:11,791
-Yes. Why?
-You forgot.

312
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:16,333
You told me about all those pictures
you had clicked for your new job.

313
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,791
I want to see the pictures.
I hope you have them.

314
00:23:18,875 --> 00:23:21,583
Of course, Mom!
You won't believe it...

315
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:23,833
-Vasu.
-Coffee? I'll get it.

316
00:23:23,916 --> 00:23:26,583
No, I don't want coffee.
Come here and sit next to me.

317
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,833
Remember this movie?

318
00:23:33,375 --> 00:23:35,208
We had gone to Bangalore
to watch this movie.

319
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:37,375
It was raining very heavily that day.

320
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:39,166
Yes.

321
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:42,541
What was the theater's name?

322
00:23:42,833 --> 00:23:44,208
-Majestic!
-Yes.

323
00:23:44,458 --> 00:23:45,916
But we could hardly watch the movie.

324
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:48,250
Kartik was with us.

325
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:51,541
-Perhaps he was four years old.
-Yes.

326
00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:53,791
He was very naughty.

327
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:56,708
Yes, he didn't let us watch the movie.

328
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:59,541
I took him out of the theater
when the movie began--

329
00:23:59,625 --> 00:24:01,125
I took him out during the latter half.

330
00:24:01,208 --> 00:24:03,791
That's how we missed half of the movie.

331
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:09,208
We bought him chips and chocolates,
but nothing worked.

332
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:11,333
Please don't go.

333
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:14,041
Let's watch the movie together.

334
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,708
What about dinner?

335
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:18,875
Don't worry.

336
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,166
We'll have what's leftover.

337
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:23,250
Kartik, you can join us.

338
00:24:26,916 --> 00:24:29,583
Dad, I've got some work on my laptop.

339
00:24:30,041 --> 00:24:30,916
Enjoy the movie.

340
00:24:32,875 --> 00:24:35,250
The young ones are always
busy with their laptops.

341
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:39,000
This song was very popular.

342
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,875
I remember the lyrics.

343
00:24:45,041 --> 00:24:47,041
Rajkumar is a great actor.

344
00:24:47,916 --> 00:24:50,500
The actors these days are
not as talented as him.

345
00:24:54,416 --> 00:24:56,000
There you are.

346
00:24:56,208 --> 00:24:57,625
I was looking for you.

347
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,791
Why aren't you watching the movie?

348
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:05,291
The movie is not as important
as spending time with you.

349
00:25:06,583 --> 00:25:10,500
But it is definitely more important to
spend quality time with your husband.

350
00:25:10,625 --> 00:25:12,833
Mom, don't miss this chance.

351
00:25:12,916 --> 00:25:14,500
Shut up!

352
00:25:14,875 --> 00:25:16,666
We've been married for 30 years.

353
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:19,708
-Now, show me those pictures.
-Sure.

354
00:25:20,958 --> 00:25:23,708
So, these kids at the shelter home...

355
00:25:26,583 --> 00:25:28,708
But all of them were very naughty.

356
00:25:28,791 --> 00:25:32,375
This is Chintu. He took my camera.

357
00:25:35,083 --> 00:25:38,333
Kartik, answer the call. Who could it be?

358
00:25:38,583 --> 00:25:39,666
I know who it is.

359
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:40,875
How?

360
00:25:41,083 --> 00:25:41,958
I already know.

361
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:43,375
I just know it all!

362
00:25:45,041 --> 00:25:46,416
It's the ringtone, Mom.

363
00:25:46,541 --> 00:25:49,041
I've set a different ringtone
for Aman's calls.

364
00:25:49,625 --> 00:25:52,458
Your roommate, right?

365
00:25:52,541 --> 00:25:54,375
Okay, talk to him.

366
00:26:02,958 --> 00:26:04,125
Let's talk on Skype.

367
00:26:06,791 --> 00:26:09,916
At the moment, I'm with
the world's busiest person.

368
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,250
She is the most important person
in my life.

369
00:26:12,333 --> 00:26:14,666
My dear mother!

370
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,750
Give my regards to her.

371
00:26:17,541 --> 00:26:18,375
Listen.

372
00:26:18,458 --> 00:26:19,958
<span style="style.default_1">There's something very important.</span>

373
00:26:20,041 --> 00:26:22,291
I told you I'm with my mother.

374
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:24,958
-But...
-Kartik.

375
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:26,208
How do I open this folder?

376
00:26:26,291 --> 00:26:27,750
No! Don't open it.

377
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,333
Why?

378
00:26:29,916 --> 00:26:31,125
It's private.

379
00:26:32,083 --> 00:26:33,541
Private?

380
00:26:38,083 --> 00:26:40,791
Sorry, there's some problem
with the network here.

381
00:26:40,875 --> 00:26:42,083
I'll call you later.

382
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,083
There's no issue with the network.

383
00:26:44,166 --> 00:26:45,708
You have an issue with me being here.

384
00:26:46,041 --> 00:26:48,375
Mom, please don't mind.

385
00:26:48,458 --> 00:26:50,625
<span style="style.default_1">Wait! You must see all the pictures.</span>

386
00:26:50,708 --> 00:26:52,583
Later. Speak to him now.

387
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:55,666
What is it?

388
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,666
-Kuku, tomorrow is D-Day.
-D-Day?

389
00:26:57,875 --> 00:27:00,125
The verdict day for Section 377.

390
00:27:00,416 --> 00:27:02,750
The Supreme Court will
deliver its verdict tomorrow.

391
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:07,750
I hope the judgment is in our favor.

392
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:15,833
No matter what the verdict...

393
00:27:16,708 --> 00:27:18,833
our relationship will not change.

394
00:27:24,041 --> 00:27:25,166
Please wake up.

395
00:27:25,833 --> 00:27:27,291
I just dozed off.

396
00:27:34,208 --> 00:27:35,083
Sister-in-law!

397
00:27:36,166 --> 00:27:37,333
I'm hungry.

398
00:27:37,416 --> 00:27:38,958
Set the table. I'll get the food.

399
00:27:39,291 --> 00:27:42,708
If I set the table,
I'll miss the interview.

400
00:27:43,875 --> 00:27:46,791
Brother, please switch the channel.

401
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:48,583
I'm watching a movie.

402
00:27:48,916 --> 00:27:51,208
It's time for the sports news.

403
00:27:51,291 --> 00:27:53,958
The match between India and South Africa
is scheduled for tomorrow.

404
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,708
Indians are obsessed with cricket.

405
00:27:58,958 --> 00:27:59,833
Here.

406
00:28:21,125 --> 00:28:23,208
Such people should be arrested.

407
00:28:24,208 --> 00:28:26,250
In fact, they should be shot dead.

408
00:28:30,541 --> 00:28:33,625
Brother, why are you so angry?

409
00:28:33,708 --> 00:28:36,666
It doesn't concern us.

410
00:28:36,875 --> 00:28:39,666
I get angry because they
are ruining our culture.

411
00:28:40,083 --> 00:28:43,833
They are spoiling our moral values.

412
00:28:45,375 --> 00:28:46,916
Dad, they are not criminals.

413
00:28:48,958 --> 00:28:50,041
Keep quiet.

414
00:28:50,291 --> 00:28:51,833
You know nothing about this.

415
00:28:53,208 --> 00:28:55,875
I wonder what kind of families
such people belong to.

416
00:28:57,291 --> 00:28:58,750
-Listen up!
-Yes?

417
00:28:58,833 --> 00:29:01,291
-Dinner is ready.
-Okay, I'll be there.

418
00:29:01,583 --> 00:29:03,625
Come on, Sarita.

419
00:29:07,166 --> 00:29:08,791
Please switch it off.

420
00:29:08,916 --> 00:29:11,458
-You can watch something else.
-Okay...

421
00:29:12,833 --> 00:29:14,791
Kartik, have some tamarind rice.

422
00:29:15,333 --> 00:29:16,750
No, I'm not hungry.

423
00:29:17,041 --> 00:29:20,458
You don't eat well,
that's why you've lost weight.

424
00:29:21,375 --> 00:29:22,208
She is right.

425
00:29:22,291 --> 00:29:23,208
That's enough.

426
00:29:24,083 --> 00:29:25,833
You need to have a strong personality.

427
00:29:27,583 --> 00:29:29,166
Only then will your wife respect you.

428
00:29:30,333 --> 00:29:31,958
You want to marry Neela, don't you?

429
00:29:32,291 --> 00:29:33,541
Please have your dinner.

430
00:29:34,875 --> 00:29:36,791
You can talk to him about this
in the morning.

431
00:29:37,291 --> 00:29:39,166
The future is unpredictable!

432
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:40,250
-What?
-What do you mean?

433
00:29:40,333 --> 00:29:43,833
Will our cricket team win
the match in South Africa?

434
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,375
Oh, no! Just have your dinner.

435
00:29:50,083 --> 00:29:52,500
I'll make you some pancakes
for breakfast tomorrow.

436
00:29:52,583 --> 00:29:53,666
I know you love them.

437
00:29:55,291 --> 00:29:57,833
After breakfast I want to go out
and explore the town.

438
00:29:57,958 --> 00:30:00,375
I want to click a few pictures
for the new project.

439
00:30:00,875 --> 00:30:02,583
Can you recommend some interesting places?

440
00:30:03,208 --> 00:30:04,166
Devoor.

441
00:30:04,583 --> 00:30:05,958
40 kilometers from here.

442
00:30:06,666 --> 00:30:10,041
Our state government
has built a dam there.

443
00:30:10,333 --> 00:30:13,291
You need to think beyond that.

444
00:30:14,416 --> 00:30:15,666
Go to Talkad.

445
00:30:15,916 --> 00:30:19,166
There are temples that are 400 years old
on the banks of the Cauvery river.

446
00:30:19,375 --> 00:30:22,000
They were buried under sand
and excavated recently.

447
00:30:23,583 --> 00:30:25,458
That sounds interesting, Mom.

448
00:30:25,833 --> 00:30:27,791
Please join me. Let's have a picnic.

449
00:30:27,875 --> 00:30:29,583
Some other time.

450
00:30:30,166 --> 00:30:31,833
I'm very busy these days.

451
00:30:38,083 --> 00:30:40,041
Dad, can I take your car?

452
00:30:44,333 --> 00:30:46,083
Okay, take it.

453
00:30:47,166 --> 00:30:48,958
But be careful when you drive.

454
00:30:53,416 --> 00:30:57,000
<span style="style.default_1">This life is a beautiful journey</span>

455
00:30:57,166 --> 00:31:00,958
<span style="style.default_1">It is unpredictable</span>

456
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:05,083
<span style="style.default_1">This life is a beautiful journey</span>

457
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:08,916
<span style="style.default_1">It is unpredictable</span>

458
00:31:09,041 --> 00:31:10,083
I hope you are happy.

459
00:31:10,291 --> 00:31:14,208
I am very happy!
You've given me such a sweet surprise.

460
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:20,916
<span style="style.default_1">Vasu, you should go to Talkad with him.</span>

461
00:31:22,208 --> 00:31:23,458
<span style="style.default_1">Talk to him.</span>

462
00:31:24,541 --> 00:31:27,291
<span style="style.default_1">Try to find out why he is</span>
<span style="style.default_1">not ready to get married.</span>

463
00:31:32,083 --> 00:31:32,958
Sing with me.

464
00:31:33,708 --> 00:31:34,666
What?

465
00:31:36,875 --> 00:31:38,666
I can't sing.

466
00:31:44,041 --> 00:31:45,916
Is there someone special in your life?

467
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:52,541
Why don't you want to marry Neela?

468
00:31:55,625 --> 00:31:57,583
You can tell me.

469
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,083
What's her name?

470
00:32:01,708 --> 00:32:03,125
How does she look?

471
00:32:05,333 --> 00:32:06,625
Is she educated?

472
00:32:06,708 --> 00:32:08,416
Mom, stop it!

473
00:32:08,666 --> 00:32:10,708
Please don't ask me so many questions!

474
00:32:10,875 --> 00:32:12,625
I won't be able to answer you.

475
00:32:15,041 --> 00:32:17,250
You are an eligible bachelor.

476
00:32:17,333 --> 00:32:20,833
As the mother of an eligible bachelor,

477
00:32:21,291 --> 00:32:23,375
I am helpless, my dear son.

478
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:34,083
-Mom.
-Yes?

479
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,375
I wish I had come here before.

480
00:32:41,458 --> 00:32:43,875
You were here when you were two years old.

481
00:32:44,125 --> 00:32:46,375
You used to make me run after you
all the time.

482
00:32:46,708 --> 00:32:48,500
Running all over the place.

483
00:32:49,875 --> 00:32:51,833
You were very naughty.

484
00:32:53,458 --> 00:32:54,833
I'm still the same.

485
00:32:55,625 --> 00:32:57,083
I'm into fashion photography.

486
00:32:57,166 --> 00:32:59,416
Sometimes I handle ad shoots
and wildlife photography.

487
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,750
I'm interested in everything.

488
00:33:01,833 --> 00:33:03,708
That's okay.

489
00:33:04,666 --> 00:33:08,250
But you need to think
about settling down.

490
00:33:14,291 --> 00:33:16,083
That's a dangerous topic of discussion.

491
00:33:16,166 --> 00:33:17,583
Just like Dad.

492
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:21,708
Hold on!

493
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:23,500
Hold this.

494
00:33:25,791 --> 00:33:27,708
Yes, everything is fine.

495
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:32,625
Yes.

496
00:33:33,541 --> 00:33:34,416
Okay.

497
00:33:34,958 --> 00:33:36,208
Wait a minute.

498
00:33:36,875 --> 00:33:40,166
Auntie Sarita needs to know
where the rice flour is.

499
00:33:42,791 --> 00:33:47,500
Sarita, it's in a container on the
topmost shelf in the storeroom.

500
00:33:48,291 --> 00:33:51,416
Alright. I need to hang up now.

501
00:33:52,708 --> 00:33:54,500
Press here to switch it off.

502
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,166
The kingdom is in shambles
without Her Highness!

503
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:02,291
The subjects are in trouble!

504
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:08,125
Every home has one woman
who knows it all.

505
00:34:09,416 --> 00:34:11,416
It doesn't have to be a woman.

506
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,083
Yes.

507
00:34:14,375 --> 00:34:17,666
Times have changed.
People are getting broad-minded.

508
00:34:18,375 --> 00:34:22,541
Nowadays, a husband and wife
share all their responsibilities.

509
00:34:22,708 --> 00:34:24,375
Not just a husband and wife.

510
00:34:26,958 --> 00:34:30,041
I mean, you know how it is with me
in Mumbai.

511
00:34:30,583 --> 00:34:31,416
Yes.

512
00:34:31,708 --> 00:34:33,041
I've seen the photos.

513
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,416
At least you have an idea.

514
00:34:37,625 --> 00:34:39,500
I don't think there's
anything missing there.

515
00:34:42,791 --> 00:34:44,583
You are different.

516
00:34:46,208 --> 00:34:47,375
You are unique.

517
00:34:47,583 --> 00:34:48,416
Why do you say so?

518
00:34:50,375 --> 00:34:52,333
You are interested in art.

519
00:34:53,708 --> 00:34:55,833
You love cooking.

520
00:34:57,041 --> 00:34:58,583
You are a photographer.

521
00:34:59,541 --> 00:35:03,500
The most special quality about you
is that you are very sensitive.

522
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:06,916
And you are always busy on the phone.

523
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:07,833
Well...

524
00:35:17,166 --> 00:35:18,708
<span style="style.default_1">I need your help.</span>

525
00:35:19,166 --> 00:35:20,208
What is it?

526
00:35:20,291 --> 00:35:23,000
Where are my blue polka dotted boxers?

527
00:35:23,083 --> 00:35:25,583
Check the drawer on the
right side of your cupboard.

528
00:35:25,708 --> 00:35:26,666
<span style="style.default_1">Why do you need them today?</span>

529
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,083
What do you mean by that?

530
00:35:30,625 --> 00:35:32,541
And today we need luck,
more than ever.

531
00:35:33,333 --> 00:35:36,083
Remember, today is the judgment day.

532
00:35:36,833 --> 00:35:37,708
Yes.

533
00:35:39,791 --> 00:35:41,000
I forgot.

534
00:35:44,541 --> 00:35:46,083
My lucky charm is with me.

535
00:35:46,291 --> 00:35:47,541
You mean, your mother?

536
00:35:48,583 --> 00:35:49,791
She's with you on the trip?

537
00:35:50,708 --> 00:35:52,375
<span style="style.default_1">You managed to convince her, after all.</span>

538
00:35:53,375 --> 00:35:56,708
No. Actually, she gave me a surprise.

539
00:36:03,458 --> 00:36:06,208
I hope we get another lovely surprise.

540
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,375
<span style="style.default_1">Kuku.</span>

541
00:36:19,333 --> 00:36:20,416
<span style="style.default_1">Everything will be alright.</span>

542
00:36:22,416 --> 00:36:24,750
Listen, I've got to drive.

543
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:26,833
But call me as soon as you get the news.

544
00:36:27,083 --> 00:36:28,000
Kuku.

545
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:42,208
I wish we were together right now.

546
00:37:19,791 --> 00:37:21,291
What happened, Kartik?

547
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:23,625
What did your friend say?

548
00:37:24,583 --> 00:37:25,833
Nothing.

549
00:37:25,916 --> 00:37:27,958
Nothing important.

550
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:29,916
Let's go.

551
00:37:45,291 --> 00:37:46,708
Pancakes!

552
00:37:47,166 --> 00:37:49,166
Wow! You remembered!

553
00:37:49,541 --> 00:37:50,458
Of course.

554
00:37:50,666 --> 00:37:51,833
Have some.

555
00:37:52,291 --> 00:37:53,458
I'm on a fast.

556
00:37:56,875 --> 00:37:58,333
You need to eat well for the trek.

557
00:37:58,416 --> 00:38:00,541
I'll manage the trek, don't worry.

558
00:38:10,791 --> 00:38:12,375
Why is there so much of sand here?

559
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,041
It's the result of a curse.

560
00:38:14,291 --> 00:38:15,208
A curse?

561
00:38:15,541 --> 00:38:18,416
A curse that turned Talkad into a desert.

562
00:38:18,791 --> 00:38:20,583
It turned the Malangi river
into a whirlpool.

563
00:38:20,708 --> 00:38:23,125
According to the curse,
the kings of Mysore

564
00:38:23,208 --> 00:38:25,333
will never have a male heir.

565
00:38:25,583 --> 00:38:28,583
Do you think all of this is true?

566
00:38:29,125 --> 00:38:30,958
I think it's just an ancient folklore.

567
00:38:31,333 --> 00:38:32,250
That's possible.

568
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:37,416
But even today, Mysore's royal family
has to adopt a male child as their heir.

569
00:38:40,125 --> 00:38:41,208
Kartik.

570
00:38:41,666 --> 00:38:45,333
One's fate cannot be changed.

571
00:38:48,458 --> 00:38:50,458
We decide our own fate, Mom.

572
00:38:51,291 --> 00:38:53,375
In life, our purpose and identities

573
00:38:53,583 --> 00:38:56,250
are a result of our actions.

574
00:38:57,083 --> 00:38:58,125
Kartik.

575
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:02,041
Our views and opinions are different.

576
00:39:03,583 --> 00:39:04,791
How different are our lives?

577
00:39:09,875 --> 00:39:11,583
This is amazing!

578
00:39:11,958 --> 00:39:12,833
I agree.

579
00:39:13,541 --> 00:39:17,416
Imagine how grand it must have been

580
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:20,666
back in the 12th century.

581
00:39:21,458 --> 00:39:25,833
I'm sure a lot of temples are
still buried under the ground.

582
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:29,125
From here to there...
I wonder how many.

583
00:39:29,458 --> 00:39:32,625
There could be something buried
right below my feet.

584
00:39:33,458 --> 00:39:34,416
Yes.

585
00:39:34,666 --> 00:39:35,583
Maybe.

586
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:39,500
There could be something buried
inside you.

587
00:39:41,541 --> 00:39:44,125
All of us have a secret
buried deep within.

588
00:39:44,541 --> 00:39:45,375
Yes.

589
00:39:46,916 --> 00:39:49,208
Is it necessary to let that secret out?

590
00:39:49,458 --> 00:39:50,416
Yes.

591
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,958
Otherwise, the secret
might destroy the person.

592
00:39:56,125 --> 00:39:59,291
What if that secret
ends up hurting others?

593
00:40:02,291 --> 00:40:04,083
Is there a secret you
want to share with me?

594
00:40:06,791 --> 00:40:07,875
Yes...

595
00:40:08,625 --> 00:40:09,916
But, no.

596
00:40:11,333 --> 00:40:12,541
I'm not sure.

597
00:40:13,541 --> 00:40:14,500
Listen to me.

598
00:40:15,083 --> 00:40:16,208
Don't overthink.

599
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:17,958
Just say it.

600
00:40:23,791 --> 00:40:24,750
No.

601
00:40:25,291 --> 00:40:27,208
Let it be, Mom. Not right now.

602
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:28,625
Maybe later.

603
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:30,541
Let's discuss this at home.

604
00:40:31,083 --> 00:40:33,833
We are here to spend some
quality time together.

605
00:40:33,916 --> 00:40:36,625
Let's make the most of it.

606
00:40:38,125 --> 00:40:38,958
That's right.

607
00:40:39,041 --> 00:40:42,916
<span style="style.default_1">This life is a beautiful journey</span>

608
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,333
<span style="style.default_1">It is unpredictable</span>

609
00:41:20,708 --> 00:41:22,416
-Can I hire a boat?
-Yes, sir.

610
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,333
I'll row the boat. I know how to do it.

611
00:41:24,416 --> 00:41:25,875
Don't worry.

612
00:41:25,958 --> 00:41:27,291
Mom, come! Let's go.

613
00:41:27,375 --> 00:41:28,708
-Are you going to row the boat?
-Yes!

614
00:41:28,791 --> 00:41:29,666
No way!

615
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:31,375
Trust me, I know how to do it.
Come on.

616
00:41:31,458 --> 00:41:32,291
No.

617
00:41:32,375 --> 00:41:36,000
I promise you it will be the
best boat ride of your life.

618
00:41:48,708 --> 00:41:49,958
Thank you for this picnic.

619
00:41:51,333 --> 00:41:54,500
It's been a long time
since I got some fresh air.

620
00:41:58,833 --> 00:42:00,333
Here. Row the boat.

621
00:42:00,416 --> 00:42:02,125
No, I can't.

622
00:42:02,208 --> 00:42:03,166
Mom.

623
00:42:03,541 --> 00:42:05,750
Be a little adventurous.

624
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:09,666
You are extremely talented.

625
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:12,083
You have a lot of potential.

626
00:42:13,208 --> 00:42:14,583
At least, try!

627
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:17,458
-Come on.
-Kartik!

628
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:24,166
You are worthy. Please realize that!

629
00:42:26,625 --> 00:42:29,291
All these years, you've focused
on the happiness of others.

630
00:42:30,583 --> 00:42:32,375
Now start focusing
on your own happiness.

631
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,666
You used to love painting.

632
00:42:37,083 --> 00:42:40,000
Your paintings won the first prize
at our district level competitions.

633
00:42:41,583 --> 00:42:43,791
That's all in the past, Kartik.

634
00:42:44,708 --> 00:42:46,000
I was young.

635
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,125
I had dreams.

636
00:42:49,625 --> 00:42:51,625
It's never too late to dream again.

637
00:42:53,125 --> 00:42:54,166
I agree.

638
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,291
I'll focus on my dreams when
I'm done with all my duties.

639
00:42:59,875 --> 00:43:03,708
When you will marry and
bring home a lovely bride.

640
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,250
She will handle all the household chores.

641
00:43:07,416 --> 00:43:09,875
That's when I'll have the free time
to focus on my paintings.

642
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:14,416
I'll also visit you in Mumbai
and help you out there.

643
00:43:14,708 --> 00:43:15,708
I know

644
00:43:15,791 --> 00:43:20,666
that it is very difficult for a girl
to manage a home all alone.

645
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:23,416
Mom.

646
00:43:29,791 --> 00:43:30,875
Mom, I'm...

647
00:43:31,458 --> 00:43:32,333
I'm...

648
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:45,333
I am a homosexual.

649
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:52,083
I am not interested in women.

650
00:43:53,916 --> 00:43:55,625
I like men.

651
00:44:00,166 --> 00:44:02,041
I'm in love with a man.

652
00:44:04,708 --> 00:44:06,541
I'm in love with Aman.

653
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:17,541
<span style="style.default_1">The shadows of this evening</span>

654
00:44:26,083 --> 00:44:28,416
Mom, please calm down.

655
00:44:41,083 --> 00:44:46,000
<span style="style.default_1">The shadows of this evening</span>

656
00:44:46,083 --> 00:44:50,833
<span style="style.default_1">They are very depressing and gloomy</span>

657
00:44:50,916 --> 00:44:56,208
<span style="style.default_1">Unaware of the truth</span>
<span style="style.default_1">My heart refutes</span>

658
00:44:56,291 --> 00:45:00,791
<span style="style.default_1">Unaware of the truth</span>
<span style="style.default_1">My heart refutes</span>

659
00:45:00,958 --> 00:45:06,916
<span style="style.default_1">It all seems like a cruel game</span>

660
00:45:10,041 --> 00:45:15,416
<span style="style.default_1">She flows</span>

661
00:45:15,875 --> 00:45:20,416
<span style="style.default_1">She bears</span>

662
00:46:36,791 --> 00:46:39,875
Can I find a car mechanic, nearby?

663
00:46:39,958 --> 00:46:40,958
No.

664
00:46:41,375 --> 00:46:42,916
Any hotel or guesthouse
where I can check in?

665
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:43,875
-There.
-Right there.

666
00:46:43,958 --> 00:46:45,083
-There?
-Yes.

667
00:46:46,416 --> 00:46:47,583
Mom, here...

668
00:46:52,375 --> 00:46:53,375
Mom?

669
00:46:55,333 --> 00:46:56,250
Mom!

670
00:47:08,083 --> 00:47:11,208
Mom!

671
00:47:22,708 --> 00:47:23,708
Mom.

672
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:26,916
Mom?

673
00:47:28,541 --> 00:47:29,416
Mom!

674
00:47:33,541 --> 00:47:35,458
There's nothing around.

675
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,875
We'll find a car mechanic
only in the morning.

676
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,833
There's a guesthouse.

677
00:47:44,458 --> 00:47:45,416
Nearby.

678
00:48:08,291 --> 00:48:09,791
Can we get a room?

679
00:48:09,958 --> 00:48:10,833
Sure.

680
00:48:11,583 --> 00:48:12,583
Please come in.

681
00:48:17,708 --> 00:48:18,541
Mom.

682
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:40,000
Mom.

683
00:48:42,666 --> 00:48:44,916
Mom, I didn't want to
hide anything from you.

684
00:49:28,083 --> 00:49:29,500
Kuku, where are you?

685
00:49:29,708 --> 00:49:31,458
<span style="style.default_1">I've been trying to call you.</span>

686
00:49:31,541 --> 00:49:33,166
My phone had network issues.

687
00:49:33,958 --> 00:49:35,458
I just came out to my mother.

688
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:39,583
How is she?

689
00:49:40,208 --> 00:49:41,458
I hope she is okay.

690
00:49:41,916 --> 00:49:42,958
Not at all.

691
00:49:43,625 --> 00:49:45,000
She has been crying.

692
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:49,000
Amu, she doesn't want to speak to me.

693
00:49:49,375 --> 00:49:51,000
<span style="style.default_1">I shouldn't have told her.</span>

694
00:49:56,333 --> 00:49:59,208
Please don't blame yourself.

695
00:49:59,291 --> 00:50:01,333
Give it some time.

696
00:50:01,916 --> 00:50:05,333
It's quite unexpected for her.

697
00:50:09,416 --> 00:50:10,875
Mom and you...

698
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:14,416
You both are very close to me.

699
00:50:16,208 --> 00:50:18,041
And I had to tell her someday.

700
00:50:19,833 --> 00:50:20,958
About us.

701
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:24,916
About our love, about our life.

702
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:25,875
Kuku.

703
00:50:26,125 --> 00:50:28,416
It's not just about you and me.

704
00:50:30,375 --> 00:50:32,333
<span style="style.default_1">This is about your mother's acceptance.</span>

705
00:50:32,458 --> 00:50:34,041
<span style="style.default_1">About her approval.</span>

706
00:50:37,958 --> 00:50:39,625
I don't want to understand
anything right now.

707
00:50:48,125 --> 00:50:50,416
Spend some time with your mother.

708
00:50:50,875 --> 00:50:52,375
Take care of her.

709
00:51:07,416 --> 00:51:09,458
Why is my blue-eyed boy feeling blue?

710
00:51:17,166 --> 00:51:18,208
And...

711
00:51:18,708 --> 00:51:21,250
Kartik came out to his mother today.

712
00:51:27,458 --> 00:51:29,500
His mom is not able to understand him.

713
00:51:30,875 --> 00:51:33,333
Sushant, she is from a small town.

714
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:35,333
Of course.

715
00:51:35,416 --> 00:51:38,958
My mother is not some
superstar or rock star.

716
00:51:39,458 --> 00:51:43,000
It doesn't matter where she's from.
Be it a small town or a metro.

717
00:51:43,458 --> 00:51:46,541
It is difficult for any
mother to accept this.

718
00:51:50,333 --> 00:51:52,083
Kartik's coming out story.

719
00:51:52,541 --> 00:51:55,333
And the fact that his mother
is not able to accept it.

720
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,916
All the drama in front of the media.

721
00:52:05,291 --> 00:52:06,875
And then someone asked her...

722
00:52:15,166 --> 00:52:19,375
I remember when I
came out to my mother...

723
00:52:21,291 --> 00:52:22,916
she stopped talking to me.

724
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:26,958
It's been almost a year now.

725
00:52:29,375 --> 00:52:33,166
I'm not sure if she has
told my father about it.

726
00:52:34,791 --> 00:52:36,125
Shall I tell you the truth?

727
00:52:36,583 --> 00:52:40,458
Mothers love to keep such secrets

728
00:52:40,666 --> 00:52:44,333
and cry over them.

729
00:52:46,041 --> 00:52:48,375
Just like us.

730
00:54:39,625 --> 00:54:40,625
Please eat something.

731
00:54:41,375 --> 00:54:42,875
You're not on a fast today.

732
00:54:44,416 --> 00:54:45,250
No.

733
00:54:45,916 --> 00:54:47,125
I'll eat after a bath.

734
00:54:53,083 --> 00:54:57,583
What if you die out of hunger?

735
00:55:00,125 --> 00:55:01,416
Then, so be it.

736
00:55:11,125 --> 00:55:12,333
Sister-in-law.

737
00:55:12,416 --> 00:55:14,000
This is ridiculous.

738
00:55:14,083 --> 00:55:16,708
Whenever you are not at home,
the cooking gas gets exhausted.

739
00:55:16,916 --> 00:55:19,833
The maid doesn't turn up.
And today, there's no electricity.

740
00:55:20,666 --> 00:55:23,041
Sister-in-law, I'm hungry.

741
00:55:23,125 --> 00:55:24,875
Please prepare something for me to eat.

742
00:55:26,208 --> 00:55:28,083
Vinita was here.

743
00:55:28,166 --> 00:55:30,458
She wanted to borrow your recipe diary.

744
00:55:30,541 --> 00:55:31,750
I refused.

745
00:55:31,833 --> 00:55:36,125
Shailaja came to invite you
to the prayer meeting.

746
00:55:36,208 --> 00:55:37,166
I told her that you'll be there.

747
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:39,333
The milkman was here
asking for money...

748
00:55:42,208 --> 00:55:45,416
Sister-in-law, I'm talking to you!

749
00:55:47,041 --> 00:55:48,333
I heard you.

750
00:56:02,375 --> 00:56:04,125
I need to order a gas cylinder.

751
00:56:04,583 --> 00:56:06,291
<span style="style.default_1">Call the gas agency then.</span>

752
00:56:08,041 --> 00:56:10,083
But they deliver only after two days.

753
00:56:10,875 --> 00:56:13,333
You have an electric stove, use that.

754
00:56:13,541 --> 00:56:15,375
Don't bother me with all these things.

755
00:56:15,708 --> 00:56:17,291
There's no electricity at home.

756
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:19,125
When will that be sorted?

757
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:20,291
<span style="style.default_1">How would I know?</span>

758
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:25,375
You work at the electricity board.

759
00:56:26,291 --> 00:56:27,291
Vasu.

760
00:56:27,708 --> 00:56:30,666
I can't keep track of the power supply.

761
00:56:31,375 --> 00:56:33,708
That's not my job.

762
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,791
That's not what I'm supposed to do.

763
00:56:37,208 --> 00:56:39,958
But the electricity at home...

764
00:56:40,958 --> 00:56:42,250
Okay, I'll find out.

765
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:45,541
Did he agree?

766
00:56:48,666 --> 00:56:49,541
<span style="style.default_1">Vasu.</span>

767
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,416
<span style="style.default_1">Did you manage to convince him?</span>

768
00:56:53,083 --> 00:56:54,708
No... I mean...

769
00:56:55,083 --> 00:56:56,458
I didn't have a word with him.

770
00:56:56,583 --> 00:56:58,958
You couldn't even do
something as simple as that.

771
00:57:00,958 --> 00:57:03,958
Now, please hang up.
Let me work in peace.

772
00:57:04,208 --> 00:57:05,458
But, the electricity...

773
00:57:06,166 --> 00:57:08,291
I'll find out about that. Hang up now.

774
00:57:33,916 --> 00:57:35,416
Mom, please dry your hair.

775
00:57:39,791 --> 00:57:41,750
I'll do that after I finish
my prayer routine.

776
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:44,083
You'll catch cold.

777
00:57:44,458 --> 00:57:46,750
I've told you this many times.
Why don't you listen to me?

778
00:57:47,291 --> 00:57:48,958
Don't worry, I'm used to it.

779
00:57:49,041 --> 00:57:50,541
Nothing will happen to me.

780
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:52,750
What if something happens to you?

781
00:57:53,750 --> 00:57:55,333
Mom, why are you so stubborn?

782
00:57:56,958 --> 00:57:58,375
You always have your own way.

783
00:57:58,791 --> 00:58:00,291
Will you ever change?

784
00:58:00,583 --> 00:58:01,416
Will you?

785
00:58:03,208 --> 00:58:05,291
Get done with the cooking.
We'll discuss this later.

786
00:58:11,166 --> 00:58:12,833
There's nothing to discuss about.

787
00:58:26,083 --> 00:58:27,333
That's not how you do it.

788
00:58:27,708 --> 00:58:29,708
Kartik, I'll show you how it's done.

789
00:58:30,583 --> 00:58:32,833
Hold it like this and slice it sideways.

790
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:35,250
Otherwise, your finger will get cut.

791
00:58:38,833 --> 00:58:40,541
You are training him well.

792
00:58:43,041 --> 00:58:44,583
What will he grow up to be?

793
00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:46,708
A cook?

794
00:58:46,833 --> 00:58:48,708
-But, he...
-You are spoiling him.

795
00:58:49,250 --> 00:58:51,416
He's with you in the kitchen
all the time.

796
00:58:52,208 --> 00:58:54,500
Why doesn't he go out and
play with the other children?

797
00:58:57,541 --> 00:58:58,375
Get up.

798
00:58:58,458 --> 00:59:00,500
Go out and play.

799
00:59:01,666 --> 00:59:02,666
Get me some coffee.

800
00:59:07,708 --> 00:59:08,541
Kartik.

801
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:10,958
Go outside and play with the boys.

802
00:59:11,791 --> 00:59:12,875
Play with the boys?

803
00:59:17,708 --> 00:59:19,791
You always tell me that you are busy.

804
00:59:19,875 --> 00:59:21,166
So, go and get busy with your work.

805
00:59:22,083 --> 00:59:23,250
Mom, I'm on a holiday.

806
00:59:24,125 --> 00:59:26,333
Just get out of the kitchen!

807
00:59:26,583 --> 00:59:27,791
Okay, I'm leaving.

808
00:59:41,416 --> 00:59:44,791
<span style="style.default_1">I feel like a criminal when</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I look at her condition.</span>

809
00:59:45,625 --> 00:59:47,166
<span style="style.default_1">That's what the society thinks of us.</span>

810
00:59:55,083 --> 00:59:57,041
Sorry, I couldn't tell you about it
yesterday.

811
00:59:59,791 --> 01:00:03,083
The Supreme Court has
reinstated Section 377.

812
01:00:03,833 --> 01:00:06,875
It has further stated that
if the Parliament wishes,

813
01:00:06,958 --> 01:00:10,583
it can change or cancel Section 377.

814
01:00:10,875 --> 01:00:12,166
What are we going to do, Amu?

815
01:00:13,708 --> 01:00:16,416
If my mother comes to know,
she'll worry even more.

816
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,208
<span style="style.default_1">It's hard for her to accept it.</span>

817
01:00:18,291 --> 01:00:20,125
Now, it will be all the
more difficult for her.

818
01:00:20,208 --> 01:00:22,541
Kuku, you know that
being gay is not a crime.

819
01:00:23,041 --> 01:00:24,791
Only the sexual act is a crime.

820
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:29,583
Listen, I got to go.

821
01:00:29,708 --> 01:00:32,125
-But, I am...
-Kuku, I have a presentation.

822
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:33,708
I'll call you in the evening.

823
01:00:34,750 --> 01:00:36,166
I don't want to talk to you.

824
01:00:36,833 --> 01:00:37,875
Listen to me.

825
01:00:49,291 --> 01:00:50,791
I wish you had hung up on me.

826
01:00:50,958 --> 01:00:52,875
Get on with your presentation. Bye.

827
01:00:52,958 --> 01:00:54,666
Kartik!

828
01:00:56,791 --> 01:00:58,291
Who were you speaking to?

829
01:00:58,625 --> 01:01:01,333
A girlfriend? Or, your roommate?

830
01:01:01,958 --> 01:01:03,500
Yes, it was Aman's call.

831
01:01:03,875 --> 01:01:08,291
Okay. Kartik, I hope you remember,
I need your help with something important.

832
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:13,125
I need a few pictures clicked
to be sent to my pen friend.

833
01:01:24,416 --> 01:01:26,208
He is settled in Delhi.

834
01:01:28,791 --> 01:01:30,625
He is my pen friend.

835
01:01:31,166 --> 01:01:33,416
He's from abroad.
He belongs to the Iyer community.

836
01:01:34,833 --> 01:01:36,541
In this age of e-mail and WhatsApp?

837
01:01:38,041 --> 01:01:41,250
It's not possible to send
lipstick marked kisses on e-mail.

838
01:01:42,708 --> 01:01:43,875
No more questions now.

839
01:01:43,958 --> 01:01:46,750
-Just keep clicking.
-Turn around.

840
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:48,625
Oh, no!

841
01:01:48,708 --> 01:01:51,041
From that angle I'll look fat.

842
01:01:53,375 --> 01:01:56,750
Auntie, there's no way you'll
look fat in the pictures.

843
01:01:56,833 --> 01:01:59,083
You look amazing from every angle.

844
01:02:00,291 --> 01:02:01,833
Oh, shut up.

845
01:02:01,916 --> 01:02:05,416
I'm your aunt. Please behave yourself.

846
01:02:06,666 --> 01:02:08,083
You are my sexy aunt.

847
01:02:08,166 --> 01:02:10,208
Kartik, I hope the pictures look good.

848
01:02:12,750 --> 01:02:13,916
Your portfolio is being shot

849
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,875
by an award winning,
talk of the town photographer.

850
01:02:17,166 --> 01:02:18,708
I hardly care about that.

851
01:02:19,625 --> 01:02:21,458
I just want my pen friend to like me.

852
01:02:22,375 --> 01:02:23,250
That's all.

853
01:02:25,166 --> 01:02:26,291
You trust me, right?

854
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:34,583
Does anyone else know
about your pen friend?

855
01:02:36,833 --> 01:02:38,333
Sister-in-law knows.

856
01:02:40,166 --> 01:02:41,791
She understands me.

857
01:02:44,291 --> 01:02:45,125
But, my brother...

858
01:02:46,875 --> 01:02:48,333
Kartik, shall I tell you something?

859
01:02:52,458 --> 01:02:53,875
Whenever you marry...

860
01:02:55,833 --> 01:02:59,458
do so only because you love that person.

861
01:03:01,583 --> 01:03:03,833
Don't get married under pressure.

862
01:03:08,458 --> 01:03:09,708
Mom told me.

863
01:03:11,708 --> 01:03:13,625
Your husband used to beat you.

864
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:17,333
I'm glad that you left him.

865
01:03:54,166 --> 01:03:55,791
<span style="style.default_1">You keep me waiting, Kartik.</span>

866
01:03:58,458 --> 01:03:59,333
Who is this?

867
01:03:59,541 --> 01:04:00,416
<span style="style.default_1">It's me.</span>

868
01:04:01,666 --> 01:04:02,875
Uncle Ramesh.

869
01:04:03,666 --> 01:04:05,291
-Tell me.
-When are you coming home?

870
01:04:06,208 --> 01:04:07,333
How about tomorrow?

871
01:04:08,041 --> 01:04:08,875
Why?

872
01:04:09,833 --> 01:04:10,750
Don't you know why?

873
01:04:10,916 --> 01:04:12,125
Both of us...

874
01:04:12,333 --> 01:04:13,291
Together...

875
01:04:14,666 --> 01:04:15,666
We will have lunch.

876
01:04:17,291 --> 01:04:19,000
Don't you have to go to office tomorrow?

877
01:04:20,666 --> 01:04:21,958
I'll take a leave for you.

878
01:04:22,625 --> 01:04:23,791
<span style="style.default_1">Please don't refuse.</span>

879
01:04:24,416 --> 01:04:25,708
<span style="style.default_1">I'll be alone at home.</span>

880
01:04:26,333 --> 01:04:27,500
<span style="style.default_1">The kids will be at school.</span>

881
01:04:27,750 --> 01:04:29,875
Lata has to attend her music class.

882
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:32,458
No one will disturb us, Kartik.

883
01:04:32,875 --> 01:04:35,458
Just you and me!

884
01:04:35,750 --> 01:04:36,583
Kartik.

885
01:04:37,250 --> 01:04:38,375
I hope you come.

886
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:40,041
Let's meet.

887
01:04:40,291 --> 01:04:42,500
After I met you the other day,
I started feeling...

888
01:04:43,666 --> 01:04:44,875
Kartik, please come home.

889
01:04:45,458 --> 01:04:46,416
I'll be waiting.

890
01:04:47,208 --> 01:04:48,125
We'll have...

891
01:04:48,791 --> 01:04:49,916
a lot of fun.

892
01:04:50,583 --> 01:04:51,958
Just like we used to. Remember?

893
01:05:11,791 --> 01:05:12,791
Mom.

894
01:05:13,916 --> 01:05:14,750
Mom.

895
01:05:15,416 --> 01:05:16,875
Please talk to me.

896
01:05:17,875 --> 01:05:19,541
What's going on in your mind?

897
01:05:22,416 --> 01:05:23,416
Questions.

898
01:05:24,750 --> 01:05:25,791
Lots of questions.

899
01:05:25,875 --> 01:05:26,958
About me?

900
01:05:31,083 --> 01:05:32,666
Please ask me.

901
01:05:32,958 --> 01:05:35,250
I'll answer all your questions.

902
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:37,833
That won't be required.

903
01:05:38,250 --> 01:05:40,166
God will answer all my questions.

904
01:05:42,041 --> 01:05:43,208
Okay. Keep waiting.

905
01:05:43,291 --> 01:05:46,083
Don't expect a miracle to happen.

906
01:06:13,916 --> 01:06:15,250
Is he your son?

907
01:06:15,333 --> 01:06:17,083
-The one who lives in Mumbai?
-Yes.

908
01:06:18,291 --> 01:06:19,125
No.

909
01:06:19,208 --> 01:06:21,791
He is extremely busy with work.

910
01:06:22,541 --> 01:06:24,958
He has no time to get married.

911
01:06:25,041 --> 01:06:27,708
I'm sure he is in love with some girl.

912
01:06:27,791 --> 01:06:28,750
No.

913
01:06:29,791 --> 01:06:30,875
I don't think so.

914
01:06:31,708 --> 01:06:33,916
Then, why isn't he getting married?

915
01:06:38,791 --> 01:06:40,500
Vasudha...

916
01:06:40,583 --> 01:06:41,958
what happened?

917
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,416
-What happened to her?
-I don't know.

918
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:48,666
We just asked her why
you aren't married yet.

919
01:06:50,791 --> 01:06:52,208
What's your problem?

920
01:06:53,291 --> 01:06:55,083
Why are you asking her that question?
Ask me.

921
01:06:55,958 --> 01:06:59,833
Since you love being intrusive,
you should've asked me directly.

922
01:06:59,916 --> 01:07:00,916
I would've answered you.

923
01:07:04,958 --> 01:07:06,833
I'm sure there's something fishy.

924
01:07:29,041 --> 01:07:30,000
Sorry, Mom.

925
01:07:31,291 --> 01:07:32,916
Because of me you had to face that.

926
01:07:37,541 --> 01:07:39,125
When I didn't know...

927
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:41,500
Back then...

928
01:07:41,958 --> 01:07:44,750
It was easier for me to answer people.

929
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:47,625
Now, that I know...

930
01:07:48,375 --> 01:07:49,208
How...

931
01:07:51,125 --> 01:07:53,083
I don't know how to answer them.

932
01:07:54,333 --> 01:07:59,708
Does this fact change everything
that you liked about me?

933
01:07:59,833 --> 01:08:01,625
Everything that you were proud of?

934
01:08:03,791 --> 01:08:05,166
Has everything changed?

935
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:08,916
Am I not your son anymore?

936
01:08:11,041 --> 01:08:14,875
But, your sexuality...

937
01:08:17,291 --> 01:08:19,000
How can I ignore it?

938
01:08:20,291 --> 01:08:22,125
Don't ignore it.

939
01:08:22,833 --> 01:08:24,541
Accept it.

940
01:08:27,750 --> 01:08:29,625
If I had plans to hide it,

941
01:08:30,250 --> 01:08:31,916
I wouldn't have told you.

942
01:08:32,250 --> 01:08:34,791
For years, I've fought with myself.

943
01:08:36,291 --> 01:08:37,708
I used to wonder why I am gay.

944
01:08:38,625 --> 01:08:40,666
I used to wonder why
I have these feelings.

945
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,791
Now, I've understood.

946
01:08:50,708 --> 01:08:52,333
I'm not doing anything wrong.

947
01:08:53,125 --> 01:08:54,750
This is not normal.

948
01:08:55,666 --> 01:08:57,000
It is unnatural.

949
01:08:58,083 --> 01:08:59,666
Who decides that?

950
01:09:00,166 --> 01:09:04,500
Those who are right-handed,
consider left-handed people abnormal.

951
01:09:04,750 --> 01:09:07,916
And vice versa.

952
01:09:08,750 --> 01:09:11,125
-So, what is normal, after all?
-I don't know.

953
01:09:13,291 --> 01:09:14,125
But, this...

954
01:09:16,375 --> 01:09:17,583
This is dirty.

955
01:09:19,583 --> 01:09:21,000
It is despicable.

956
01:09:22,416 --> 01:09:23,833
Because this is...

957
01:09:25,916 --> 01:09:26,875
Sex...

958
01:09:27,833 --> 01:09:29,583
It's related to sex.

959
01:09:33,625 --> 01:09:34,791
<span style="style.default_1">What do you think?</span>

960
01:09:35,041 --> 01:09:37,500
<span style="style.default_1">Do you think I'm attracted to Aman</span>
<span style="style.default_1">only in the physical sense?</span>

961
01:09:37,833 --> 01:09:39,208
<span style="style.default_1">Is that why I love him?</span>

962
01:09:39,833 --> 01:09:40,791
<span style="style.default_1">No, Mom.</span>

963
01:09:41,291 --> 01:09:45,041
<span style="style.default_1">I have genuine feelings for him.</span>

964
01:09:45,458 --> 01:09:47,750
<span style="style.default_1">Just like you feel for Dad.</span>

965
01:09:48,333 --> 01:09:49,166
<span style="style.default_1">Yes.</span>

966
01:09:49,875 --> 01:09:52,166
<span style="style.default_1">My relationship is just as normal as that.</span>

967
01:09:52,666 --> 01:09:54,958
<span style="style.default_1">When you left for Mumbai you were not gay.</span>

968
01:09:57,375 --> 01:09:59,625
<span style="style.default_1">The city has spoilt you.</span>

969
01:10:00,041 --> 01:10:01,875
<span style="style.default_1">That's not true.</span>

970
01:10:04,375 --> 01:10:06,250
<span style="style.default_1">You need to understand me.</span>

971
01:10:09,958 --> 01:10:11,375
Look at this.

972
01:10:15,041 --> 01:10:15,958
This!

973
01:10:18,291 --> 01:10:19,291
This.

974
01:10:20,208 --> 01:10:21,250
This...

975
01:10:21,833 --> 01:10:23,291
All of this belongs to me.

976
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,291
Ever since I was a child.

977
01:10:28,916 --> 01:10:31,041
I've always been attracted to boys.

978
01:10:39,875 --> 01:10:41,333
I didn't want to tell you.

979
01:10:43,583 --> 01:10:47,875
I had my first sexual experience
with a man, right here.

980
01:10:49,083 --> 01:10:50,250
In this very house.

981
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:54,708
With Uncle Ramesh.

982
01:10:57,416 --> 01:10:58,958
When he used to live with us.

983
01:11:05,375 --> 01:11:08,000
-Did Ramesh molest you--
-No, Mom!

984
01:11:08,458 --> 01:11:10,166
He never molested me.

985
01:11:10,291 --> 01:11:11,958
He never forced me.

986
01:11:12,208 --> 01:11:13,791
It was mutual--

987
01:11:17,541 --> 01:11:18,583
Disgusting.

988
01:11:22,291 --> 01:11:23,125
Disgusting.

989
01:11:24,250 --> 01:11:25,083
Mom...

990
01:11:29,458 --> 01:11:34,208
<span style="style.default_1">Ramesh got married even though he's gay.</span>

991
01:11:34,958 --> 01:11:36,125
<span style="style.default_1">You should also get married.</span>

992
01:11:37,125 --> 01:11:40,041
<span style="style.default_1">Mom, Uncle Ramesh got married.</span>

993
01:11:40,125 --> 01:11:42,458
<span style="style.default_1">But he hasn't changed.</span>

994
01:11:42,791 --> 01:11:46,000
<span style="style.default_1">I can't live a lie.</span>

995
01:11:46,333 --> 01:11:48,208
<span style="style.default_1">I'm sure you don't want me to.</span>

996
01:11:48,916 --> 01:11:51,833
<span style="style.default_1">So, you've never been with a girl?</span>

997
01:11:52,333 --> 01:11:53,458
<span style="style.default_1">No.</span>

998
01:11:53,916 --> 01:11:57,708
<span style="style.default_1">I'm not attracted to girls.</span>

999
01:11:57,791 --> 01:11:59,083
Are you a eunuch?

1000
01:12:01,041 --> 01:12:02,000
No, Mom.

1001
01:12:02,333 --> 01:12:03,666
I'm not a eunuch.

1002
01:12:05,125 --> 01:12:06,500
But what if I was a eunuch?

1003
01:12:08,166 --> 01:12:09,583
Would you love me any less?

1004
01:12:14,541 --> 01:12:18,333
I'm a man who loves another man.

1005
01:12:19,208 --> 01:12:20,208
That's it.

1006
01:12:22,250 --> 01:12:25,541
This is not a disorder.

1007
01:12:26,625 --> 01:12:28,000
<span style="style.default_1">There has to be a solution.</span>

1008
01:12:28,833 --> 01:12:29,916
<span style="style.default_1">Surely, there must be.</span>

1009
01:12:47,125 --> 01:12:48,250
Stop it!

1010
01:12:52,250 --> 01:12:53,291
Vasu?

1011
01:12:53,833 --> 01:12:54,666
Vasu...

1012
01:12:55,875 --> 01:12:56,875
Vasu...

1013
01:12:57,541 --> 01:12:58,375
Vasu?

1014
01:12:58,958 --> 01:12:59,791
Vasu.

1015
01:13:00,583 --> 01:13:01,750
What happened?

1016
01:13:02,875 --> 01:13:04,041
A nightmare?

1017
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:10,041
What's the matter?

1018
01:13:10,125 --> 01:13:11,958
Please tell me.

1019
01:13:12,958 --> 01:13:14,000
Tell me.

1020
01:13:24,458 --> 01:13:26,125
Alright, keep crying.

1021
01:14:07,625 --> 01:14:09,791
You? Where's your mother?

1022
01:14:10,166 --> 01:14:12,541
She is praying. I'm helping her.

1023
01:14:13,166 --> 01:14:14,416
So, this is what you are.

1024
01:14:15,791 --> 01:14:18,083
Mom's perfect helper.

1025
01:14:19,166 --> 01:14:20,291
Listen to me.

1026
01:14:21,125 --> 01:14:24,708
Why don't you cancel your ticket
and stay back with us?

1027
01:14:25,333 --> 01:14:27,416
You can continue being
your mother's helper.

1028
01:14:28,250 --> 01:14:29,125
Dad!

1029
01:14:30,958 --> 01:14:32,000
I'm serious.

1030
01:14:33,291 --> 01:14:34,208
Stay here.

1031
01:14:34,458 --> 01:14:36,375
You'll save your expenses.

1032
01:14:37,416 --> 01:14:39,125
There's nothing out there for you, anyway.

1033
01:14:39,666 --> 01:14:42,416
-Why do you want to go back?
-For work!

1034
01:14:43,458 --> 01:14:47,750
He's a very famous photographer in Mumbai.

1035
01:14:47,875 --> 01:14:49,666
Kartik, I forgot what you told me.

1036
01:14:49,750 --> 01:14:50,916
Oh, yes.

1037
01:14:51,041 --> 01:14:54,000
He told me that he is an award winning,
talk of the town photographer.

1038
01:14:55,041 --> 01:14:58,958
His photographs are featured
in the exhibitions over there.

1039
01:14:59,041 --> 01:15:00,000
Alright.

1040
01:15:00,083 --> 01:15:01,291
All of that can be done here.

1041
01:15:01,375 --> 01:15:04,125
Opposite the municipal corporation office,

1042
01:15:04,208 --> 01:15:05,583
there's a studio called
Jyoti photo studio.

1043
01:15:05,666 --> 01:15:06,791
He can work there.

1044
01:15:07,333 --> 01:15:08,791
They have a flourishing business.

1045
01:15:09,583 --> 01:15:12,750
You can continue being a photographer
and earn money as well.

1046
01:15:13,041 --> 01:15:15,333
Dad, I'm not a wedding photographer.

1047
01:15:18,833 --> 01:15:20,625
Do as you wish.

1048
01:15:20,791 --> 01:15:22,791
But marry a girl and live with us here.

1049
01:15:26,916 --> 01:15:28,166
Let him decide...

1050
01:15:29,958 --> 01:15:31,541
what he wants to do.

1051
01:15:33,208 --> 01:15:37,708
Our son is doing something
good and significant.

1052
01:15:38,833 --> 01:15:40,958
We should be happy for him.

1053
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:45,666
After moving out of this small town,

1054
01:15:45,958 --> 01:15:50,125
he has accomplished a lot for himself.

1055
01:15:55,291 --> 01:15:58,833
I'm sure Kartik is going to
be very successful one day.

1056
01:15:59,333 --> 01:16:00,416
When will he get married?

1057
01:16:05,750 --> 01:16:08,333
Let him decide when he wants to.

1058
01:16:12,208 --> 01:16:13,625
Both of you are hopeless.

1059
01:16:26,583 --> 01:16:27,708
Thanks, Mom.

1060
01:16:29,583 --> 01:16:31,708
The discussion about your marriage
has been averted.

1061
01:16:32,625 --> 01:16:33,625
Not forgotten.

1062
01:16:35,208 --> 01:16:36,875
I've given you some time to think.

1063
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,583
Even after knowing
everything about me?

1064
01:16:44,833 --> 01:16:46,250
Someday, you will change.

1065
01:16:49,041 --> 01:16:50,541
That will make everyone happy.

1066
01:16:57,291 --> 01:16:58,916
Don't do this!

1067
01:16:59,666 --> 01:17:01,000
Don't do this.

1068
01:17:01,166 --> 01:17:04,083
If a hair strand falls in the food,
it will be spoilt.

1069
01:17:04,333 --> 01:17:07,708
Wet hair will spoil your health.

1070
01:17:07,791 --> 01:17:09,000
Enough!

1071
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:10,750
I know it all!

1072
01:17:13,625 --> 01:17:16,250
Then why don't you know
that I can't change?

1073
01:17:19,291 --> 01:17:21,208
Or, is that something
you don't wish to accept?

1074
01:17:26,708 --> 01:17:28,791
Mom, remember what
you said the other day?

1075
01:17:30,541 --> 01:17:34,125
One's fate cannot be changed.

1076
01:17:36,083 --> 01:17:39,000
And you told me that
we decide our own fate.

1077
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:40,916
The way we want it.

1078
01:17:43,958 --> 01:17:44,958
So, what now?

1079
01:17:45,083 --> 01:17:46,625
How will we find a solution?

1080
01:17:53,166 --> 01:17:54,583
Please give it a thought.

1081
01:17:56,208 --> 01:17:57,458
I'll think about it as well.

1082
01:18:02,541 --> 01:18:06,000
Mom, this is just the beginning.

1083
01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:10,416
We have a long journey ahead.

1084
01:18:12,750 --> 01:18:14,333
There'll be new discoveries.

1085
01:18:16,208 --> 01:18:17,500
For you.

1086
01:18:17,958 --> 01:18:19,375
For me as well.

1087
01:18:23,041 --> 01:18:25,541
But we need to be together
in this journey.

1088
01:18:27,208 --> 01:18:29,166
I wonder where this journey will end.

1089
01:19:16,541 --> 01:19:18,208
I was just thinking about calling you.

1090
01:19:18,291 --> 01:19:19,708
Are you missing me?

1091
01:19:20,125 --> 01:19:21,125
Of course not.

1092
01:19:21,458 --> 01:19:23,208
I thought, I'll just help you.

1093
01:19:24,875 --> 01:19:27,000
-What kind of help?
-Help you to miss me more.

1094
01:19:27,958 --> 01:19:30,791
You were missing me, all by yourself.

1095
01:19:36,875 --> 01:19:37,958
I don't know what to say.

1096
01:19:38,791 --> 01:19:40,708
If you were here,
you would have said something.

1097
01:19:41,375 --> 01:19:43,333
<span style="style.default_1">If you were here,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">you would have done something.</span>

1098
01:19:43,458 --> 01:19:44,708
You would have been angry

1099
01:19:44,791 --> 01:19:47,458
about the ironed clothes that
are still in the living room.

1100
01:19:48,916 --> 01:19:52,875
If you were here, you would have asked
why I haven't watered the plants yet.

1101
01:19:54,041 --> 01:19:57,416
If you were here,
you would've had tea with me.

1102
01:19:58,625 --> 01:20:02,041
If you were here, well...
you would be you.

1103
01:20:02,666 --> 01:20:07,958
Bravo! Thank you for
explaining it so well.

1104
01:20:10,666 --> 01:20:13,041
Now tell me, how's everything out there?

1105
01:20:17,666 --> 01:20:20,458
-Actually, this morning, Mom--
-Kartik, come here!

1106
01:20:20,750 --> 01:20:22,541
Yes, Mom. I'm coming.

1107
01:20:23,583 --> 01:20:24,541
Mom is calling me.

1108
01:20:24,625 --> 01:20:26,000
Shall I call you later?

1109
01:20:26,083 --> 01:20:27,500
<span style="style.default_1">No, it's okay.</span>

1110
01:20:29,666 --> 01:20:30,541
Alright.

1111
01:20:31,333 --> 01:20:32,666
Give my regards to her.

1112
01:20:32,750 --> 01:20:34,541
Speak to her, she is right here.

1113
01:20:34,625 --> 01:20:36,875
No... I'm good.

1114
01:20:38,541 --> 01:20:40,583
Mom, Aman says hello to you.

1115
01:20:42,125 --> 01:20:43,041
Lift this.

1116
01:20:44,125 --> 01:20:45,916
Mom is sending you her blessings.

1117
01:20:49,833 --> 01:20:50,958
Be careful.

1118
01:20:56,833 --> 01:20:57,958
How is she?

1119
01:20:58,041 --> 01:20:59,166
Much better.

1120
01:20:59,875 --> 01:21:02,875
You know, she defended me
in front of my father.

1121
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:06,375
Yes.

1122
01:21:07,583 --> 01:21:10,041
But she still hopes I'll change.

1123
01:21:10,125 --> 01:21:13,000
She will always hope for that.

1124
01:21:13,458 --> 01:21:18,208
<span style="style.default_1">She will hope for that</span>
<span style="style.default_1">until she is convinced.</span>

1125
01:21:18,833 --> 01:21:21,958
<span style="style.default_1">Until she knows that the path you've</span>
<span style="style.default_1">chosen is not fraught with danger.</span>

1126
01:21:22,625 --> 01:21:23,791
That you will be happy.

1127
01:21:24,125 --> 01:21:25,708
That her dear son will be happy.

1128
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:30,916
Take care of yourself and eat well.

1129
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,291
I need to edit Auntie Sarita's pictures.

1130
01:21:44,083 --> 01:21:46,000
Kartik, what's the matter?

1131
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:57,291
Kartik, did you take my charger?

1132
01:22:25,625 --> 01:22:26,958
Dad, those are my private photos!

1133
01:22:30,625 --> 01:22:32,375
Dad! Please don't!

1134
01:22:32,458 --> 01:22:33,958
I'll kill you!

1135
01:22:34,041 --> 01:22:36,125
Get out of my house!

1136
01:22:40,750 --> 01:22:42,458
How dare you...

1137
01:22:42,541 --> 01:22:44,791
-Sister-in-law...
-What happened?

1138
01:22:45,541 --> 01:22:47,041
-Dad!
-How dare you...

1139
01:22:48,625 --> 01:22:50,791
-Stop it! Don't hit him.
-Get out of my way.

1140
01:22:53,583 --> 01:22:55,125
Get out of my house!

1141
01:22:56,208 --> 01:22:57,083
Get out!

1142
01:22:57,750 --> 01:23:02,708
<span style="style.default_1">Much as I want to walk with you</span>

1143
01:23:02,791 --> 01:23:07,708
<span style="style.default_1">I don't know how to keep up the pace</span>

1144
01:23:07,791 --> 01:23:12,583
<span style="style.default_1">Much as I want to walk with you</span>

1145
01:23:12,666 --> 01:23:17,375
<span style="style.default_1">I don't know how to keep up the pace</span>

1146
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:20,541
<span style="style.default_1">You are mine</span>

1147
01:23:20,833 --> 01:23:24,083
<span style="style.default_1">You are mine</span>

1148
01:23:24,166 --> 01:23:29,833
<span style="style.default_1">You are mine</span>

1149
01:23:29,916 --> 01:23:32,208
<span style="style.default_1">Yet far away from me</span>

1150
01:23:32,291 --> 01:23:38,125
<span style="style.default_1">How do I hide this pain?</span>

1151
01:23:41,541 --> 01:23:47,125
<span style="style.default_1">She flows</span>

1152
01:23:47,208 --> 01:23:51,333
<span style="style.default_1">She bears</span>

1153
01:24:03,291 --> 01:24:04,125
Kartik.

1154
01:24:05,125 --> 01:24:06,125
Why are you here?

1155
01:24:06,250 --> 01:24:07,250
What...

1156
01:24:07,375 --> 01:24:08,208
Show me.

1157
01:24:08,291 --> 01:24:09,333
How did you get hurt?

1158
01:24:09,833 --> 01:24:11,041
Come home with me.

1159
01:24:11,125 --> 01:24:13,416
-No, Uncle Ramesh. I'm fine.
-I'll help you with a bandage.

1160
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:14,541
-No.
-Don't be stubborn.

1161
01:24:14,625 --> 01:24:16,083
-No...
-Please come.

1162
01:24:16,166 --> 01:24:17,458
Be careful.

1163
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,458
You are badly hurt.

1164
01:24:19,750 --> 01:24:21,833
Why were you sitting on the road?
I hope you are okay.

1165
01:24:21,916 --> 01:24:22,875
Yes.

1166
01:24:23,208 --> 01:24:24,791
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

1167
01:24:29,291 --> 01:24:31,083
Kartik, have some juice.

1168
01:24:31,833 --> 01:24:34,583
I've made it myself especially for you.
Drink it.

1169
01:24:35,166 --> 01:24:36,750
Uncle, why did you take the trouble?

1170
01:24:37,041 --> 01:24:38,791
Hardly any trouble.

1171
01:24:39,458 --> 01:24:40,791
Lata is not at home.

1172
01:24:41,166 --> 01:24:43,541
She has gone to fetch
the kids from school.

1173
01:24:44,458 --> 01:24:46,708
She'll be back only after an hour.

1174
01:24:49,375 --> 01:24:51,041
Wait, I'll help you.

1175
01:24:53,291 --> 01:24:54,833
It's hurting. Let me check.

1176
01:24:55,083 --> 01:24:56,291
Where does it hurt?

1177
01:24:56,375 --> 01:24:58,083
Please let me check.

1178
01:24:58,583 --> 01:25:00,250
-Where?
-My leg hurts.

1179
01:25:01,125 --> 01:25:03,083
-Here?
-A little below that.

1180
01:25:03,166 --> 01:25:04,625
Let me check. Here?

1181
01:25:04,833 --> 01:25:06,375
-A little below that.
-Where exactly?

1182
01:25:07,250 --> 01:25:08,125
Here?

1183
01:25:08,833 --> 01:25:10,333
-A little lower.
-Here?

1184
01:25:10,916 --> 01:25:11,791
Here?

1185
01:25:12,625 --> 01:25:13,583
Where does it hurt?

1186
01:25:13,708 --> 01:25:14,791
Uncle, stop it!

1187
01:25:14,875 --> 01:25:17,166
I'll apply an ointment.
You'll feel better.

1188
01:25:17,291 --> 01:25:19,041
Listen to me, you'll feel much better.

1189
01:25:19,125 --> 01:25:20,000
Uncle, stop it!

1190
01:25:20,083 --> 01:25:21,916
-Kartik, you'll feel better...
-Stop!

1191
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:25,000
-You'll like it like you used to.
-Stop it!

1192
01:25:25,125 --> 01:25:26,541
Kartik!

1193
01:25:28,041 --> 01:25:29,833
-Listen to me.
-Let me go.

1194
01:25:29,916 --> 01:25:30,750
Let me go!

1195
01:25:31,833 --> 01:25:32,916
Let me go!

1196
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:34,750
Kartik...

1197
01:26:15,083 --> 01:26:15,916
Yes.

1198
01:26:16,750 --> 01:26:17,583
No.

1199
01:26:19,125 --> 01:26:19,958
No...

1200
01:26:20,041 --> 01:26:21,625
It has to be done today itself.

1201
01:26:57,208 --> 01:26:59,166
Sister-in-law!

1202
01:26:59,750 --> 01:27:00,750
Sister-in-law.

1203
01:27:00,833 --> 01:27:02,083
Look at what they are doing!

1204
01:27:02,166 --> 01:27:04,291
There's a bonfire and two priests
are performing a ritual.

1205
01:27:04,375 --> 01:27:06,583
Come and see...

1206
01:27:09,583 --> 01:27:10,541
-Oh, Kartik!
-Mom.

1207
01:27:10,625 --> 01:27:12,458
Kartik, don't go there.

1208
01:27:17,208 --> 01:27:18,416
What are you doing?

1209
01:27:20,916 --> 01:27:23,333
What is happening? What's going on?

1210
01:27:24,583 --> 01:27:25,666
Tell me!

1211
01:27:29,250 --> 01:27:31,750
I'm performing... Kartik's funeral rites.

1212
01:28:13,875 --> 01:28:16,708
Kartik's funeral rites?

1213
01:28:18,125 --> 01:28:20,125
How dare you?

1214
01:28:23,625 --> 01:28:28,041
You are just his father.

1215
01:28:30,916 --> 01:28:33,041
He is born out of me.

1216
01:28:35,833 --> 01:28:37,541
I nurtured him in my womb.

1217
01:28:39,875 --> 01:28:43,375
I've protected him from all odds.

1218
01:28:48,041 --> 01:28:51,666
I have sustained his being in my womb...

1219
01:28:52,625 --> 01:28:58,250
by giving it my all.

1220
01:29:00,958 --> 01:29:02,875
For nine months...

1221
01:29:08,750 --> 01:29:11,875
As a child, when he used to fall sick

1222
01:29:12,791 --> 01:29:18,208
I held him against my bosom all night.

1223
01:29:20,458 --> 01:29:22,791
During his exams...

1224
01:29:23,333 --> 01:29:26,708
I helped him study all night.

1225
01:29:28,333 --> 01:29:29,750
You didn't.

1226
01:29:35,958 --> 01:29:37,625
All these years

1227
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:42,375
I've raised him...

1228
01:29:45,541 --> 01:29:48,500
with a lot of care and hardship.

1229
01:29:49,416 --> 01:29:51,041
You did not.

1230
01:29:55,750 --> 01:29:59,166
How dare you think about
performing the funeral rites

1231
01:29:59,833 --> 01:30:04,500
of my son who is still alive?

1232
01:30:07,083 --> 01:30:08,291
How dare you?

1233
01:30:10,916 --> 01:30:12,583
How dare you!

1234
01:30:15,458 --> 01:30:17,541
Who gave you the right to do so?

1235
01:30:25,208 --> 01:30:28,000
Whoever Kartik is...

1236
01:30:28,875 --> 01:30:30,125
however he is...

1237
01:30:30,750 --> 01:30:32,375
he is mine!

1238
01:30:34,041 --> 01:30:35,916
I support him.

1239
01:30:48,041 --> 01:30:50,958
Remember this! Kartik will not leave.

1240
01:30:51,666 --> 01:30:54,041
No one can throw him
out of this house.

1241
01:30:54,791 --> 01:30:58,041
As much as this house
belongs to you and me...

1242
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:00,458
it belongs to him.

1243
01:31:00,833 --> 01:31:02,666
It belongs to my son!

1244
01:31:07,208 --> 01:31:09,500
Kartik, come inside.

1245
01:31:14,166 --> 01:31:15,041
Come.

1246
01:31:25,125 --> 01:31:26,416
Sorry, Kartik.

1247
01:31:27,083 --> 01:31:32,916
It is very unfortunate.
This shouldn't have happened.

1248
01:31:35,291 --> 01:31:36,291
No, Mom...

1249
01:31:37,583 --> 01:31:38,500
No.

1250
01:31:41,791 --> 01:31:44,291
-Because of me...
-Don't apologize.

1251
01:31:45,750 --> 01:31:50,958
To accept oneself
is a matter of great courage.

1252
01:31:53,125 --> 01:31:59,000
But for how long will you
continue to fight alone...

1253
01:32:00,708 --> 01:32:02,916
with people, with society?

1254
01:32:03,625 --> 01:32:06,833
Mom, I'm not alone.

1255
01:32:08,291 --> 01:32:09,750
You are with me.

1256
01:32:12,041 --> 01:32:13,166
Aman is with me.

1257
01:32:15,791 --> 01:32:17,625
I have faith in Aman.

1258
01:32:19,583 --> 01:32:21,958
I have complete faith in our love.

1259
01:32:24,208 --> 01:32:25,625
That's great, Kartik.

1260
01:32:28,416 --> 01:32:30,250
But you are very young.

1261
01:32:31,791 --> 01:32:33,833
You have aspirations.

1262
01:32:36,666 --> 01:32:37,958
But what will happen...

1263
01:32:42,166 --> 01:32:44,875
What will happen when you grow old?

1264
01:32:46,958 --> 01:32:49,458
Will you both be together, even then?

1265
01:32:49,958 --> 01:32:52,333
That's our plan, Mom.

1266
01:32:54,291 --> 01:32:56,041
We want to grow old together.

1267
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:06,083
I am not sure if I can
understand you completely.

1268
01:33:06,333 --> 01:33:07,791
I can't really comprehend any of it.

1269
01:33:08,916 --> 01:33:11,666
But I can assure you that I don't
care about the opinion of others.

1270
01:33:15,125 --> 01:33:16,833
I'll support you and Aman.

1271
01:33:18,416 --> 01:33:19,500
Always.

1272
01:33:20,416 --> 01:33:21,333
Forever.

1273
01:33:25,375 --> 01:33:26,666
Thanks, Mom.

1274
01:34:55,500 --> 01:34:56,500
Kartik!

1275
01:35:07,875 --> 01:35:11,208
Will you and Dad be okay?

1276
01:35:12,625 --> 01:35:14,375
Don't worry about us.

1277
01:35:15,625 --> 01:35:19,875
We have been through many
ups and downs in our lives.

1278
01:35:20,333 --> 01:35:21,875
We'll get through this as well.

1279
01:35:27,750 --> 01:35:28,583
Kartik.

1280
01:35:32,875 --> 01:35:34,166
For you...

1281
01:35:35,041 --> 01:35:37,000
and for your partner Aman.

1282
01:35:39,125 --> 01:35:40,958
Next time, get him along.

1283
01:35:44,375 --> 01:35:49,750
<span style="style.default_1">She flows</span>

1284
01:35:50,125 --> 01:35:53,958
<span style="style.default_1">She bears</span>

1285
01:35:54,291 --> 01:35:58,916
<span style="style.default_1">She flows</span>

1286
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:03,791
<span style="style.default_1">She bears</span>

1287
01:36:04,666 --> 01:36:11,541
<span style="style.default_1">She never speaks her mind</span>

1288
01:36:14,083 --> 01:36:19,375
<span style="style.default_1">She is trapped</span>

1289
01:36:19,458 --> 01:36:20,958
<span style="style.default_1">Like a river</span>

1290
01:36:21,041 --> 01:36:27,541
<span style="style.default_1">That doesn't get to decide its own flow</span>

1291
01:36:28,375 --> 01:36:33,916
<span style="style.default_1">She flows</span>

1292
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:37,958
<span style="style.default_1">She bears</span>

1293
01:36:38,291 --> 01:36:43,750
<span style="style.default_1">She flows</span>

1294
01:36:43,833 --> 01:36:48,833
<span style="style.default_1">She bears</span>

1295
01:36:53,750 --> 01:36:54,666
<span style="style.default_1">Hello, Mom.</span>

1296
01:36:56,291 --> 01:36:58,791
<span style="style.default_1">I'm glad that we both have started</span>
<span style="style.default_1">thinking alike, once again.</span>

1297
01:37:00,250 --> 01:37:02,750
<span style="style.default_1">Perhaps we will start understanding</span>
<span style="style.default_1">each other, once again.</span>

1298
01:37:04,208 --> 01:37:05,916
<span style="style.default_1">You say that I'm different.</span>

1299
01:37:07,166 --> 01:37:08,500
<span style="style.default_1">Do you know why I am different?</span>

1300
01:37:08,583 --> 01:37:10,291
<span style="style.default_1">It's because you are very special.</span>

1301
01:37:12,291 --> 01:37:14,916
<span style="style.default_1">I've always discovered myself</span>
<span style="style.default_1">through you.</span>

1302
01:37:15,458 --> 01:37:17,750
<span style="style.default_1">My goodness comes from you.</span>

1303
01:37:19,041 --> 01:37:20,458
<span style="style.default_1">Forever yours,</span>

1304
01:37:20,958 --> 01:37:21,791
<span style="style.default_1">Kartik.</span>

1305
01:37:28,666 --> 01:37:29,625
Vasu.

1306
01:37:31,875 --> 01:37:32,708
Vasu.

1307
01:37:33,500 --> 01:37:34,333
Vasu?

1308
01:37:38,208 --> 01:37:39,416
Vasu!

1309
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:42,875
Vasu--

1310
01:37:42,958 --> 01:37:44,000
Brother.

1311
01:37:46,416 --> 01:37:48,583
Sister-in-law asked me
to serve you some coffee.

1312
01:37:50,791 --> 01:37:52,083
She is busy.

1313
01:38:28,958 --> 01:38:30,333
Or tea?

1314
01:38:32,791 --> 01:38:33,666
Tea.

1315
01:38:33,750 --> 01:38:34,791
Tea!

1316
01:38:55,708 --> 01:38:57,375
-Kuku.
-Yes?

1317
01:38:57,666 --> 01:38:59,166
-Kuku!
-Yes?

1318
01:38:59,541 --> 01:39:01,375
I've run out of dental floss.

1319
01:39:01,875 --> 01:39:03,708
The new pack is right there.

1320
01:39:04,083 --> 01:39:06,375
Where is it? I can't find it.

1321
01:39:06,458 --> 01:39:07,750
Come here and give it to me.

1322
01:39:07,833 --> 01:39:10,291
It's in the bathroom cabinet, take it.

1323
01:39:12,916 --> 01:39:16,333
I wonder how he became the
Assistant Finance Manager.

1324
01:39:16,875 --> 01:39:18,458
This is how!
