Hello...

33
00:08:04,386 --> 00:08:05,223
What are you doing?

34
00:08:05,378 --> 00:08:06,219
Just had dinner.

35
00:08:06,244 --> 00:08:07,323
Going to bed now.

36
00:08:07,648 --> 00:08:08,528
What you had?

37
00:08:08,528 --> 00:08:09,488
Parotta...

38
00:08:09,488 --> 00:08:10,208
Oh!

39
00:08:10,688 --> 00:08:11,248
Okay...

40
00:08:11,497 --> 00:08:12,937
Aren't you coming for
the festival?

41
00:08:13,082 --> 00:08:13,841
No...

42
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:15,408
Everyone will be out of station,

43
00:08:15,408 --> 00:08:17,368
I will get extra payment
for overtime job.

44
00:08:18,453 --> 00:08:19,614
"Covetous"

45
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:22,088
When will you come to
my home to talk about our marriage?

46
00:08:22,143 --> 00:08:23,063
I must come...

47
00:08:23,326 --> 00:08:25,006
As you solicited for a diamond ring,

48
00:08:25,289 --> 00:08:26,848
I'm trying to make it.

49
00:08:26,848 --> 00:08:27,248
Hmm...

50
00:08:28,648 --> 00:08:29,648
I will come along with my father,

51
00:08:29,772 --> 00:08:32,452
put the ring in everyone's presence

52
00:08:32,808 --> 00:08:34,008
and finally will persuade.

53
00:08:34,224 --> 00:08:34,865
Endure till then.

54
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:36,088
How long still?

55
00:08:37,008 --> 00:08:37,728
Hmm...

56
00:08:38,808 --> 00:08:39,368
For four months...

57
00:08:39,568 --> 00:08:40,608
You mean,"four months?"

58
00:08:41,327 --> 00:08:43,407
You've been waiting a long time...

59
00:08:43,983 --> 00:08:44,903
Just four months from on now,

60
00:08:44,928 --> 00:08:45,688
Please tolerate.

61
00:08:45,688 --> 00:08:47,328
Okay,let me sleep.

62
00:08:47,328 --> 00:08:48,768
I have work at morning,
First shift.

63
00:08:48,978 --> 00:08:50,538
Hey, wait...

64
00:08:51,049 --> 00:08:52,288
Give me the"periodic peck."

65
00:08:56,439 --> 00:08:57,119
"Good night"
-"Good night"

66
00:09:02,495 --> 00:09:03,375
Dad, we will eat.

67
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:04,683
"Dad"...

68
00:09:11,588 --> 00:09:12,348
"Dad"...

69
00:09:39,008 --> 00:09:39,528
"Dad"...

70
00:09:42,168 --> 00:09:42,608
"Dad"...

71
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:50,648
Sir, that's why I say...

72
00:09:52,102 --> 00:09:52,662
Come,

73
00:09:53,288 --> 00:09:54,088
Yes, come.

74
00:10:00,015 --> 00:10:01,375
Have you enquired with your relatives?

75
00:10:02,314 --> 00:10:03,608
Not that, I enquired...

76
00:10:03,693 --> 00:10:05,013
He didn't go anywhere.

77
00:10:05,808 --> 00:10:08,488
Had he gone missing like this earlier?

78
00:10:08,699 --> 00:10:10,379
No sir...
"It's the first time."

79
00:10:13,319 --> 00:10:15,399
Did you search into the nearby
well and lake?

80
00:10:16,768 --> 00:10:17,888
Oh no!...

81
00:10:19,808 --> 00:10:20,808
Lord Shiva!

82
00:10:20,907 --> 00:10:23,168
If my dad heads home safely,

83
00:10:23,168 --> 00:10:26,208
I will lurch around your temple.
(A mode of worship to God)

84
00:10:26,968 --> 00:10:27,328
Sir...

85
00:10:28,603 --> 00:10:32,923
It's favorable if we contact "Kerala state police"
and search for him.

86
00:10:33,993 --> 00:10:35,673
He was in distress for past few days.

87
00:10:36,993 --> 00:10:38,593
He was stuck with "flight of imagination."

88
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:44,968
On a late Sunday,
when we were playing cards...

89
00:10:48,608 --> 00:10:49,608
Brother, it's your turn.

90
00:10:55,049 --> 00:10:57,368
"How beautiful is this world!"

91
00:11:05,928 --> 00:11:06,288
Sir,

92
00:11:07,089 --> 00:11:08,649
I reminisce a matter.

93
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:09,768
What's that?

94
00:11:10,223 --> 00:11:13,033
We will contact the "Kerala state police".

95
00:11:13,741 --> 00:11:16,141
Erstwhile,when we were in shop...

96
00:11:22,672 --> 00:11:23,352
"Sadha"

97
00:11:23,377 --> 00:11:23,937
Yes, brother...

98
00:11:24,524 --> 00:11:26,023
Do you remember?

99
00:11:26,469 --> 00:11:27,328
In the days of yore,

100
00:11:27,328 --> 00:11:29,368
We relished cabaret dance in unison?

101
00:11:31,071 --> 00:11:32,377
Can't forget that brother.

102
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:34,665
Her dance still a feast for my eyes.

103
00:11:36,957 --> 00:11:43,677
A song from the movie
"SATTAM EN KAYIL"

104
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:45,422
I wish to see it again.

105
00:11:46,917 --> 00:11:48,918
Okay,we will go.

106
00:11:49,273 --> 00:11:50,832
Heard that it is eventualized in Kollam.

107
00:11:51,808 --> 00:11:53,808
If we go by bus at dusk,

108
00:11:53,972 --> 00:11:57,372
Will relish the dance
and return by dawn.

109
00:12:01,284 --> 00:12:04,004
I shouldn't hide anything at this situation.

110
00:12:04,168 --> 00:12:05,568
That's why I said.

111
00:12:06,822 --> 00:12:09,062
Don't panic him by unnecessary implications!

112
00:12:09,931 --> 00:12:10,743
You leave now.

113
00:12:10,768 --> 00:12:11,768
I will inquest for him.

114
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:30,300
Selvam, get me a glass and some water.

115
00:12:37,518 --> 00:12:38,799
You don't worry.

116
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:41,197
He won't go anywhere
without informing me.

117
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:11,649
What happened?

118
00:13:21,747 --> 00:13:24,028
Dad,what are you doing here?

119
00:13:27,877 --> 00:13:28,837
Dad...

120
00:13:29,748 --> 00:13:30,548
Silence...

121
00:13:38,255 --> 00:13:39,295
Selvam, is he there?

122
00:13:39,408 --> 00:13:40,327
Yes, he is...

123
00:13:40,939 --> 00:13:41,979
Haven't i told you?

124
00:13:42,128 --> 00:13:43,888
He won't go anywhere
without informing me.

125
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:47,648
Dad...

126
00:14:05,317 --> 00:14:06,838
What were you doing for such
a long haul in plantain grove?

127
00:14:09,168 --> 00:14:12,128
Everyone gossips that you are
stuck with "flight of imagination".

128
00:14:18,278 --> 00:14:20,126
-"went to see
whether it goes around!"

129
00:14:20,528 --> 00:14:21,008
Hmm...

130
00:14:23,648 --> 00:14:24,728
Milk...

131
00:14:25,368 --> 00:14:25,808
Milk...

132
00:14:26,808 --> 00:14:27,448
Milk...

133
00:14:29,307 --> 00:14:29,867
Sir...

134
00:14:31,843 --> 00:14:32,523
Sir...

135
00:14:34,326 --> 00:14:34,886
Who is that?

136
00:14:37,607 --> 00:14:38,007
What?

137
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,320
I want to meet your father.

138
00:14:40,107 --> 00:14:41,935
He is taking bath.

139
00:14:42,222 --> 00:14:43,011
What about you?

140
00:14:43,036 --> 00:14:44,756
I took bath early morning.

141
00:14:46,567 --> 00:14:48,008
I'm "Vikadakavi"

142
00:14:48,217 --> 00:14:49,937
Son of temple priest.

143
00:14:49,962 --> 00:14:50,922
I want to meet your father.

144
00:14:52,331 --> 00:14:53,130
Okay, come in.

145
00:14:59,804 --> 00:15:00,804
Who is that?

146
00:15:01,309 --> 00:15:03,309
Dad,dress up and come.

147
00:15:15,528 --> 00:15:16,368
Are you"Superstar Rajini's fan?"

148
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:18,175
No, "Kamal fan".

149
00:15:19,809 --> 00:15:20,886
I'm an ardent fan of
"Superstar Rajini".

150
00:15:21,489 --> 00:15:23,374
He dons any role,

151
00:15:23,545 --> 00:15:25,775
As a rickshaw puller, Auto driver,
Policeman or as an Usher...

152
00:15:25,907 --> 00:15:27,747
But an unique style,Rajini style!

153
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:28,861
Look there.

154
00:15:30,599 --> 00:15:31,823
But Kamal sir is discrete.

155
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:33,208
He dons multifarious styles in every film.

156
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:34,528
Ten novel styles in "Dasavatharam".

157
00:15:34,528 --> 00:15:36,048
Four novel styles in
"Michael Madana Kamarajan".

158
00:15:36,094 --> 00:15:37,414
Three novel styles in
"Apoorva sagotharargal".

159
00:15:37,496 --> 00:15:38,661
Two novel styles in
"Kaithiyin dairy".

160
00:15:38,686 --> 00:15:39,966
And a Unitary style in
"16 vayathinile".

161
00:15:42,758 --> 00:15:43,558
Why do you laugh?

162
00:15:44,013 --> 00:15:44,893
-yuck

163
00:15:45,422 --> 00:15:46,662
It's good to see you laughing.

164
00:15:46,927 --> 00:15:48,367
Hey...hey...come.

165
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,039
Bye

166
00:16:01,218 --> 00:16:02,138
Lakshmi...

167
00:16:02,163 --> 00:16:03,123
Yes, coming.

168
00:16:04,979 --> 00:16:06,493
Do you have any knowledge about
"photoshop?"

169
00:16:06,667 --> 00:16:07,507
I'm familiar with it as I studied.

170
00:16:07,923 --> 00:16:08,768
What did you study?

171
00:16:08,768 --> 00:16:11,008
"CS6, CC, CC+, JAVA+..."

172
00:16:11,008 --> 00:16:11,849
okay,
okay.

173
00:16:12,526 --> 00:16:13,206
Come back on Monday.

174
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,320
Yes sir.

175
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:15,328
Take it.

176
00:16:15,554 --> 00:16:16,434
Just wait.

177
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,220
I am going by that way,
will drop you.

178
00:16:30,251 --> 00:16:32,805
Hi swamy,
are you ascending the palm tree for jelly?

179
00:16:33,111 --> 00:16:35,911
No, i'm here to wash clothes.

180
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:38,623
You shouldn't have asked him.

181
00:16:38,923 --> 00:16:39,928
Only his name is meant
spiritually "Swamy".

182
00:16:40,001 --> 00:16:41,368
All his talks are awful.

183
00:16:41,393 --> 00:16:42,594
I won't curb my tongue.

184
00:16:43,946 --> 00:16:46,783
Recently, thieves are mushrooming.

185
00:16:46,931 --> 00:16:47,887
Hey... hey...

186
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:48,978
Are you blind?

187
00:16:49,063 --> 00:16:50,863
If not, will I get my sister
married to you?

188
00:16:50,888 --> 00:16:51,448
Go away...Go away...

189
00:16:51,448 --> 00:16:53,008
Never get married among relations.

190
00:16:53,008 --> 00:16:54,408
I contend not to see his countenance,

191
00:16:54,408 --> 00:16:55,408
But he comes abutting.

192
00:16:55,805 --> 00:16:56,325
Get down.

193
00:16:56,665 --> 00:16:58,168
Do you want me to drop
in your house?

194
00:16:58,168 --> 00:16:58,543
Get lost.

195
00:16:58,599 --> 00:16:59,439
Come back on Monday.

196
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:03,670
Get me the Coat.

197
00:17:04,085 --> 00:17:04,925
"Selvam!"

198
00:17:05,071 --> 00:17:07,343
Brother, when were you back from Malaysia?

199
00:17:07,368 --> 00:17:07,968
Yesterday.

200
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,990
Settled a new grove.

201
00:17:10,212 --> 00:17:11,208
The registration is on.

202
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:12,888
Have to take a passport size photo.

203
00:17:15,015 --> 00:17:16,015
Give it.

204
00:17:18,578 --> 00:17:20,014
Put the hand right.

205
00:17:22,748 --> 00:17:23,428
Brother, shall we take?

206
00:17:23,453 --> 00:17:23,773
Yes.

207
00:17:24,527 --> 00:17:25,607
Hey Malai, move aside.

208
00:17:27,499 --> 00:17:28,619
Brother, see here.

209
00:17:29,609 --> 00:17:30,369
Smile...

210
00:17:30,779 --> 00:17:31,619
Chin up...

211
00:17:32,339 --> 00:17:33,099
Shoulder down...

212
00:17:34,203 --> 00:17:34,883
Chin down...

213
00:17:36,448 --> 00:17:39,288
One...two...eyes open.

214
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:45,773
Hang up my coat.

215
00:17:46,048 --> 00:17:48,983
Brother, I modified your
skin's complexion in the photo.

216
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:50,008
Who's? Mine?

217
00:17:50,008 --> 00:17:50,448
Yes.

218
00:17:50,448 --> 00:17:50,848
Let me see.

219
00:17:55,146 --> 00:17:56,786
You look gorgeous in photo.

220
00:17:58,156 --> 00:17:58,716
Enough...

221
00:18:00,499 --> 00:18:01,099
How much?

222
00:18:03,255 --> 00:18:04,256
Uncle, shall we have dinner?

223
00:18:04,427 --> 00:18:05,827
Just five minutes.

224
00:18:17,376 --> 00:18:18,776
Curd rice at most?

225
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:19,871
Yes uncle.

226
00:18:20,089 --> 00:18:22,936
It became late, as i rifle throughout
the night for dad.

227
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:23,535
I didn't cook.

228
00:18:24,909 --> 00:18:26,749
What was he doing in
plantain grove?

229
00:18:27,438 --> 00:18:28,439
It's become perpetual to him.

230
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:30,430
Seldom he do something.

231
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:32,358
Agedness makes them to be so.

232
00:18:32,491 --> 00:18:33,811
"It's a second childhood."

233
00:18:34,205 --> 00:18:35,700
For instance, take my case,

234
00:18:35,725 --> 00:18:38,566
I can't sit for ten minutes
on the whole.

235
00:18:38,836 --> 00:18:40,477
Back pain is severe.

236
00:18:40,772 --> 00:18:41,492
But…

237
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:45,409
some persons are gifted like "Rangaswamy."

238
00:18:45,676 --> 00:18:46,757
Which "Rangaswamy?"

239
00:18:46,782 --> 00:18:47,702
Hey...Hey...

240
00:18:48,365 --> 00:18:49,364
Don't act...

241
00:18:49,498 --> 00:18:51,379
How many persons are you familiar
with that name?

242
00:18:51,741 --> 00:18:52,981
Grandfather of Valli.

243
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:55,573
He is a old fogey than
me and your father.

244
00:18:55,702 --> 00:18:57,542
But he has iron-willed body.

245
00:18:58,072 --> 00:19:01,676
Old folk still do swimming
in early mornings.

246
00:19:01,893 --> 00:19:02,918
Now on my way,

247
00:19:03,229 --> 00:19:05,174
I saw him ascending on palm tree.

248
00:19:05,495 --> 00:19:07,256
Staunch bodied.

249
00:19:07,336 --> 00:19:08,612
for twenty years,

250
00:19:08,851 --> 00:19:11,129
"Lord Yama, the god of death"
will be afraid to strike a chord on him.

251
00:19:16,331 --> 00:19:17,112
Selvam,

252
00:19:17,199 --> 00:19:19,239
Rangaswamy fell from palm tree and died.

253
00:19:19,884 --> 00:19:20,723
Just now...

254
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:24,085
Pungent mouth...

255
00:19:26,933 --> 00:19:27,350
Come...

256
00:19:27,595 --> 00:19:28,861
"Valli..."
Tell me, mom.

257
00:19:29,015 --> 00:19:30,991
Your grandfather passed away
by falling from tree.

258
00:19:31,016 --> 00:19:33,536
Will i have to come then?

259
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:35,922
I will lose my salary,
if i take leave

260
00:19:36,127 --> 00:19:37,646
It won't be good.

261
00:19:38,095 --> 00:19:39,776
Relatives will talk ill.

262
00:19:40,298 --> 00:19:42,017
Come for name sake.

263
00:19:43,063 --> 00:19:43,891
Yes mom.

264
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:44,876
I will come.

265
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,754
I am going out on work.

266
00:20:14,779 --> 00:20:16,780
Your makeup seems to be high.
Brush up a little.

267
00:20:37,187 --> 00:20:40,533
It's a square of "ABCD".

268
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,561
Hey Selvam,

269
00:20:41,631 --> 00:20:43,750
which girl do you like
the most in this class?

270
00:20:49,366 --> 00:20:49,886
"Valli"

271
00:20:50,093 --> 00:20:52,587
Teacher, Selvam likes Valli
the most.

272
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:55,510
Silence.

273
00:20:57,263 --> 00:20:58,063
Selvam, get up.

274
00:20:58,734 --> 00:21:00,391
You are here to study,
Concentrate only on studies.

275
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:01,575
Understand?
Stretch out your hand.

276
00:21:02,538 --> 00:21:04,219
He is "Lord Muruga," likes valli.

277
00:21:05,616 --> 00:21:06,297
Silence.

278
00:21:06,297 --> 00:21:07,257
Concentrate on the lesson.

279
00:21:13,984 --> 00:21:19,424
"Valluvar"-a living poet!
"Valluvar"-living in his verse!

280
00:21:19,824 --> 00:21:25,144
"Bharathi"-a man with mane!
"Bharathi"-our adored poet!

281
00:21:25,536 --> 00:21:30,976
"Classical tamil!
Sweet-sounding tamil!"

282
00:21:30,976 --> 00:21:34,896
"Aavaiyar " - lives in the poetry which beguiles me!

283
00:21:34,896 --> 00:21:37,175
"Divine Tamil,solicits!"

284
00:21:37,175 --> 00:21:43,056
"Valluvar"-a living poet!
"Valluvar"-living in his verse!

285
00:22:29,736 --> 00:22:35,696
"Ever yearning for you,
the beauteous smirk which yank me!"

286
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:42,056
"Ever pining to heed per diem!
Must purge my love to you!"

287
00:22:42,257 --> 00:22:44,911
"Come closer, christen me!"

288
00:22:44,936 --> 00:22:48,255
"Fingers entwined,
yen to lean on your shoulders, "

289
00:22:48,255 --> 00:22:54,336
"Ever yearning for you,
the beauteous smirk which yank me!"

290
00:22:54,482 --> 00:23:00,456
"Ever pining to heed per diem!
Must purge my love to you!"

291
00:23:15,336 --> 00:23:15,816
What happened?

292
00:23:16,739 --> 00:23:17,190
Don't know.

293
00:23:17,215 --> 00:23:18,175
Some problem in bike.

294
00:23:20,617 --> 00:23:23,137
Wonder,all the days your bike gets
stuck at the same spot?

295
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,620
It's good.

296
00:23:24,784 --> 00:23:26,224
Does the problem persist for
you or to the bike?

297
00:23:26,318 --> 00:23:28,039
Smart job.
Thanks.

298
00:23:31,232 --> 00:23:37,310
"In the twilight zone,
we ought to enunciate in ecstasy,"

299
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:43,470
"The bangles which strikes sound,
must be judged with a brass!"

300
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:49,776
"Standing at close-by, made me to feel shy
Spell bind me on that day,"

301
00:23:49,959 --> 00:23:54,896
"I devoir to lean on your
shoulders like a draped saree"

302
00:23:55,881 --> 00:24:01,791
"Ever yearning for you,
the beauteous smirk which yank me!"

303
00:24:02,129 --> 00:24:07,845
"Ever pining to heed per diem!
Must purge my love to you!"

304
00:24:08,243 --> 00:24:10,802
"Come closer, christen me!"

305
00:24:10,935 --> 00:24:14,256
"Fingers entwined,
yen to lean on your shoulders, "

306
00:24:54,476 --> 00:24:55,351
Valli...

307
00:24:55,376 --> 00:24:56,136
Mom!

308
00:24:56,877 --> 00:24:59,557
Grandfather left us.

309
00:25:02,061 --> 00:25:03,620
Just move...

310
00:25:05,202 --> 00:25:06,441
Must take a photo of the departed.

311
00:25:07,889 --> 00:25:10,769
Just move, please.

312
00:25:10,794 --> 00:25:12,034
Must take a photo of the departed.

313
00:25:42,896 --> 00:25:48,911
"What's the fizz?
A swing sways in my heart!"

314
00:25:49,053 --> 00:25:55,257
"The hot shakes wrap up my body!"

315
00:25:55,405 --> 00:25:57,896
"Decennary fingers are discernible,
Wide-awake eternally! "

316
00:25:57,896 --> 00:26:01,296
"How many days to fare
the stroll?"

317
00:26:01,921 --> 00:26:07,431
"The gust hugs me with gracious! "

318
00:26:07,456 --> 00:26:13,497
"Ever yearning for you,
the beauteous smirk which yank me!"

319
00:26:13,787 --> 00:26:19,376
"Ever pining to heed per diem!
Must purge my love to you!"

320
00:26:20,015 --> 00:26:22,511
"Come closer, christen me!"

321
00:26:22,536 --> 00:26:25,977
"Fingers entwined,
yen to lean on your shoulders, "

322
00:26:25,977 --> 00:26:31,976
"Ever yearning for you,
the beauteous smirk which yank me!"

323
00:26:32,201 --> 00:26:38,615
"Ever pining to heed per diem!
Must purge my love to you!"

324
00:27:57,669 --> 00:27:59,229
You go ahead...
Plan is ready.

325
00:28:07,336 --> 00:28:11,496
I will come by
the train at 11am,

326
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:13,871
Send me a vehicle to station.

327
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:19,670
We all get along only occasionally.

328
00:28:19,695 --> 00:28:24,856
If the relatives leave in a jiffy,
then what to do?

329
00:28:25,232 --> 00:28:26,419
Don't worry.

330
00:28:26,444 --> 00:28:30,044
when coming for thirteenth day ceremony,
i will stay back and enjoy.

331
00:28:38,527 --> 00:28:40,246
Brother,
give a peg for Inspector.

332
00:28:41,238 --> 00:28:42,154
We must have a hold on him.

333
00:28:42,474 --> 00:28:46,614
If not, he may flip the case on me
as if I pushed the oldster from tree.

334
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:47,544
Yes... yes...

335
00:28:47,783 --> 00:28:48,262
Take it.

336
00:28:50,139 --> 00:28:51,378
Sir, what I say is...

337
00:29:01,153 --> 00:29:01,634
Oh god!

338
00:29:02,761 --> 00:29:03,362
What happened?

339
00:29:03,776 --> 00:29:04,336
What happened brother?

340
00:29:04,336 --> 00:29:05,337
What happened brother?

341
00:29:05,337 --> 00:29:05,616
Brother!

342
00:29:06,038 --> 00:29:06,878
Come...

343
00:29:08,016 --> 00:29:08,655
"Sada"

344
00:29:08,655 --> 00:29:09,656
"Sada"

345
00:29:09,656 --> 00:29:10,856
Get him water.

346
00:29:10,856 --> 00:29:12,375
Come fast.

347
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:12,976
Drink water.

348
00:29:12,976 --> 00:29:13,977
Not this water,

349
00:29:13,977 --> 00:29:15,095
Why do you resist me?

350
00:29:15,843 --> 00:29:16,576
Hey demon,

351
00:29:16,576 --> 00:29:18,176
he will die if you give this.

352
00:29:19,437 --> 00:29:20,616
Someone get water.

353
00:29:20,616 --> 00:29:22,056
I can't bear.

354
00:29:22,056 --> 00:29:22,536
What happened?

355
00:29:22,536 --> 00:29:23,336
Come fast.

356
00:29:24,218 --> 00:29:26,081
Don't give him water.
No...

357
00:29:26,106 --> 00:29:26,738
Why?

358
00:29:26,804 --> 00:29:27,603
Shouldn't give water at the time
of heart attack.

359
00:29:27,628 --> 00:29:28,828
Only gaseous intake.

360
00:29:28,856 --> 00:29:29,415
Is it?

361
00:29:29,415 --> 00:29:30,735
Give him something warm.

362
00:29:31,288 --> 00:29:31,976
What?

363
00:29:32,085 --> 00:29:33,845
Wait... Wait... Wait...

364
00:29:33,981 --> 00:29:35,892
For heart attack,
"CPR" must be given.

365
00:29:36,296 --> 00:29:37,266
I can't bear.

366
00:29:37,291 --> 00:29:38,692
All of you come here.

367
00:29:38,987 --> 00:29:40,104
Come here.

368
00:29:40,538 --> 00:29:41,270
What are you going to do?

369
00:29:41,295 --> 00:29:42,015
Lie down quiet.

370
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:42,922
We will take care.

371
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:44,016
It's a silent attack.

372
00:29:44,016 --> 00:29:45,296
Heart must not stop beating.

373
00:29:45,671 --> 00:29:46,456
We will do the pumping.

374
00:29:46,456 --> 00:29:47,176
Okay...

375
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,844
After I press hard for few times,

376
00:29:48,952 --> 00:29:49,776
Blow well in his mouth.

377
00:29:49,801 --> 00:29:50,441
Don't do.

378
00:29:50,814 --> 00:29:51,694
Come on...

379
00:29:51,719 --> 00:29:52,998
It's not painful now.

380
00:29:53,856 --> 00:29:54,735
Two...

381
00:29:54,735 --> 00:29:55,536
It's hurting!

382
00:29:56,176 --> 00:29:56,936
three...

383
00:29:59,015 --> 00:30:00,375
Ants here.

384
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,120
Hey Valli,

385
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:19,143
Come here.

386
00:30:19,168 --> 00:30:19,968
Hey Selva,
Come...

387
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,860
Leave me.
Leave my hand.

388
00:30:22,885 --> 00:30:24,350
Ants bite me.

389
00:30:24,445 --> 00:30:26,686
Do you know
how much I struggle to meet you?

390
00:30:27,468 --> 00:30:28,711
Hey, where are you going?

391
00:30:28,931 --> 00:30:31,091
What do you do?
Someone may note us.

392
00:30:32,671 --> 00:30:33,990
No one will notice.

393
00:30:37,489 --> 00:30:38,409
Did you eat anything?

394
00:30:39,543 --> 00:30:41,663
No, just a cup of black coffee.

395
00:30:42,808 --> 00:30:43,127
Wait.

396
00:30:46,207 --> 00:30:46,846
What's that?

397
00:30:47,276 --> 00:30:48,236
Open it.

398
00:30:49,663 --> 00:30:51,023
Your favourite "Masala vada"
(delicious spicy dal snack)

399
00:30:55,214 --> 00:30:57,933
We don't know
when we will meet next time.

400
00:30:59,764 --> 00:31:00,285
It's okay...

401
00:31:01,774 --> 00:31:02,774
After eating the vada,

402
00:31:03,219 --> 00:31:05,178
Give me the "periodic peck"
and leave.

403
00:31:05,562 --> 00:31:06,283
What noise emanates there?

404
00:31:06,308 --> 00:31:08,147
Someone may notice.
No one will come.

405
00:31:08,289 --> 00:31:09,569
My uncle will take care.

406
00:31:09,765 --> 00:31:11,175
Twenty seven...
Leave me.

407
00:31:11,175 --> 00:31:11,896
Twenty eight...
It's hurting.

408
00:31:11,896 --> 00:31:12,976
Twenty nine...
It's hurting.

409
00:31:12,976 --> 00:31:14,415
Thirty.
Blow

410
00:31:14,415 --> 00:31:15,536
No need,
go away

411
00:31:15,536 --> 00:31:18,416
Not like that.
Blow in his mouth

412
00:31:18,416 --> 00:31:19,256
Go away,

413
00:31:19,256 --> 00:31:20,216
I will do.
Blow well.

414
00:31:21,554 --> 00:31:22,154
Blow well.

415
00:31:22,936 --> 00:31:24,256
It stinks.

416
00:31:24,321 --> 00:31:25,080
Take your hand.

417
00:31:25,856 --> 00:31:26,615
Go away.

418
00:31:27,699 --> 00:31:28,900
Don't hurt me.

419
00:31:29,174 --> 00:31:30,614
I don't feel pain now.

420
00:31:34,696 --> 00:31:35,856
I told you earlier

421
00:31:35,856 --> 00:31:37,136
that your pain will go off
if "CPR" is done.

422
00:31:37,136 --> 00:31:38,295
Get lost.
don't want your "CPR"

423
00:31:38,295 --> 00:31:39,511
Brother, wait.

424
00:31:39,687 --> 00:31:41,219
Someone call the ambulance.

425
00:31:41,244 --> 00:31:43,205
Don't want.
Give it.

426
00:31:43,891 --> 00:31:45,930
I had bean nuts in the evening.
It must be flatulence.

427
00:31:46,949 --> 00:31:48,643
Shall I drop you in the house?

428
00:31:52,604 --> 00:31:53,310
Heard it?

429
00:31:53,709 --> 00:31:55,629
It's flatulence only.

430
00:31:58,590 --> 00:31:59,110
Uncle...

431
00:32:02,414 --> 00:32:03,333
Well done.

432
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:06,250
Unfortunately,it was my plan!

433
00:32:06,741 --> 00:32:09,021
If not,I would've killed you.

434
00:32:09,391 --> 00:32:11,270
It's arduous.

435
00:32:11,728 --> 00:32:12,488
Uncle...

436
00:32:13,745 --> 00:32:15,184
Uncle, what happened?
Go away...go...

437
00:32:35,446 --> 00:32:35,926
Valli,

438
00:32:37,963 --> 00:32:40,162
we got a marriage proposal
through our relative.

439
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,679
Groom belongs to Tanjore,

440
00:32:45,615 --> 00:32:47,454
Works as Sub-Inspector
in Chennai.

441
00:32:50,512 --> 00:32:51,272
Elite family,

442
00:32:52,472 --> 00:32:55,512
only son with tremendous prosperity.

443
00:32:56,456 --> 00:32:57,855
They are asking for a bride meet.

444
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,959
I told them, i will check
for your convenience.

445
00:33:06,446 --> 00:33:08,366
I feel it's a good proposal.

446
00:33:09,136 --> 00:33:11,535
You are studious.
Good in knowledge.

447
00:33:12,622 --> 00:33:15,342
Ponder well and take a wise decision.

448
00:33:20,026 --> 00:33:22,747
Still how long will you be eating
masala vada?

449
00:33:44,875 --> 00:33:45,756
Are you asleep?

450
00:33:49,471 --> 00:33:51,111
Your father tells
for your goodness.

451
00:33:51,559 --> 00:33:53,142
I know.
Don't exaggerate.

452
00:33:53,549 --> 00:33:54,549
Don't shout.

453
00:33:55,078 --> 00:33:56,078
Your sister is sleeping here.

454
00:33:56,759 --> 00:33:57,559
If not, I will...

455
00:34:03,231 --> 00:34:04,391
I know everything.

456
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:05,989
I am your mother.

457
00:34:06,742 --> 00:34:08,221
Don't think of cheating me.

458
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:17,510
Prosperous groom.

459
00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:20,830
You can lead a peaceful life.

460
00:34:23,229 --> 00:34:25,629
"Familiarity" is different
from "standard of life".

461
00:34:29,533 --> 00:34:31,653
Hug your mother once and cry loudly.

462
00:34:32,349 --> 00:34:33,829
all your problems will be solved.

463
00:34:51,068 --> 00:34:53,187
Cry your heart out!

464
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:58,319
Then,forget the past.

465
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:39,950
(Chanting Mantras)

466
00:35:39,975 --> 00:35:41,976
Ten rounds of lurch is over,get up.

467
00:35:42,631 --> 00:35:46,110
"May God save all."

468
00:35:46,462 --> 00:35:48,183
Wait...
I will fetch you water.

469
00:35:58,513 --> 00:35:59,594
A "Spiritual owe"
for sake of my father.

470
00:36:00,484 --> 00:36:01,363
It's done.

471
00:36:02,531 --> 00:36:03,372
Going to lurch around again,

472
00:36:05,075 --> 00:36:06,275
For the sake of our marriage.

473
00:36:14,265 --> 00:36:16,473
It's done.

474
00:36:16,498 --> 00:36:17,977
Another "owe" to God!

475
00:36:18,078 --> 00:36:19,398
Okay.

476
00:36:52,238 --> 00:36:53,557
Brother,
groom's family has arrived.

477
00:36:54,651 --> 00:36:55,851
Here...here...

478
00:36:56,495 --> 00:36:57,255
Stop...stop...

479
00:37:02,317 --> 00:37:03,638
Greetings!
Welcome!

480
00:37:03,809 --> 00:37:04,408
Greetings!

481
00:37:04,886 --> 00:37:05,967
You are Welcome!

482
00:37:06,593 --> 00:37:08,216
Was it tough to find out the way?

483
00:37:08,246 --> 00:37:09,605
Not at all.
Way was good.

484
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:11,638
but scouting the house was tough.

485
00:37:13,375 --> 00:37:14,745
Come.
Get in.

486
00:37:15,012 --> 00:37:16,332
Step in with right leg first.
Hmm...

487
00:37:27,263 --> 00:37:28,383
Sagadakavi!

488
00:37:28,553 --> 00:37:29,353
"Vigadakavi"

489
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:31,470
Kadagavadi?

490
00:37:32,136 --> 00:37:33,255
"Vigadakavi"

491
00:37:33,815 --> 00:37:34,775
It's okay,
Leave it.

492
00:37:35,072 --> 00:37:36,152
I will come to the point.

493
00:37:36,455 --> 00:37:37,976
In the entire district,
"Cradle ceremony,"

494
00:37:37,976 --> 00:37:39,455
"Naming ceremony,"
"Ceremony of Girlhood,"

495
00:37:39,455 --> 00:37:40,256
"Ear boring ceremony,"

496
00:37:40,256 --> 00:37:43,335
"Marriage events" or
"Funeral events,"

497
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:45,455
were designed satisfactorily
to customers

498
00:37:45,455 --> 00:37:48,296
and get the same to "Thenkasi"
for flex print and deliver in time.

499
00:37:48,296 --> 00:37:49,736
is followed by only organisation,
That is "Sada Arts"

500
00:37:50,508 --> 00:37:52,536
Discipline is more important
to work here.

501
00:37:58,410 --> 00:37:59,090
Hi...

502
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:01,130
Hi...

503
00:38:03,797 --> 00:38:06,838
Well disciplined only can work here.

504
00:38:07,945 --> 00:38:10,591
I am talking to you suavely
because you are priest's son.

505
00:38:10,734 --> 00:38:12,311
Uncle, I am going out.
Take care of the studio.

506
00:38:12,335 --> 00:38:13,776
Where are you going?
A petite death.

507
00:38:13,776 --> 00:38:15,536
Petite death means?
Is the deceased a Child?

508
00:38:15,776 --> 00:38:17,655
Friend,
do you remember me?

509
00:38:18,891 --> 00:38:20,216
Last year,
in "Tirunelveli Tournament"

510
00:38:20,216 --> 00:38:21,896
you hit sixes because
of my bowling.

511
00:38:22,812 --> 00:38:23,175
You!

512
00:38:23,883 --> 00:38:24,936
Are you associated with
Kalavani kannayiram?

513
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:25,980
I'm his brother.

514
00:38:26,383 --> 00:38:28,531
Yes.
How is your brother?

515
00:38:28,662 --> 00:38:29,823
He is fine.

516
00:38:30,328 --> 00:38:31,030
Where is he?

517
00:38:31,055 --> 00:38:32,375
In Palayamkottai.
What does he do there?

518
00:38:32,578 --> 00:38:33,418
Behind the bars...

519
00:38:35,031 --> 00:38:35,775
Remember,

520
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,720
last year in Tenkasi's
Car festival riots,

521
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,631
you stood by my side,
sent me in auto

522
00:38:39,656 --> 00:38:40,536
and gave money too.

523
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:42,301
Is it?

524
00:38:42,397 --> 00:38:43,316
Did you forget it?

525
00:38:43,596 --> 00:38:45,636
In frustration,
I didn't even thank you on that day.

526
00:38:45,686 --> 00:38:46,167
"Thank you."

527
00:38:46,775 --> 00:38:49,575
you have link in a problem
and was absconded for some days,right?

528
00:38:49,981 --> 00:38:51,502
That's in Madurai.

529
00:38:52,006 --> 00:38:54,525
It's a worthless case.
Blown up unnecessarily.

530
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:57,125
I tied up a bomb in tail of
magistrate's pet dog.

531
00:38:57,421 --> 00:38:58,862
'Idiotic donkey' ran into the house.

532
00:38:59,175 --> 00:39:00,375
You said it was 'dog'
but now say as 'donkey.'

533
00:39:00,687 --> 00:39:02,007
No,it's 'dog' only.

534
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,421
But ousted from the case.

535
00:39:03,622 --> 00:39:05,542
Who? The dog?
No, it's me!

536
00:39:05,909 --> 00:39:07,029
But a good thing happened by it.

537
00:39:07,389 --> 00:39:08,948
I learnt photoshop
when in Madurai.

538
00:39:11,043 --> 00:39:12,404
Okay, I leave now.
Meet you later.

539
00:39:12,557 --> 00:39:13,398
I will be here only.

540
00:39:13,695 --> 00:39:14,856
Sada uncle offered me a job.

541
00:39:14,856 --> 00:39:15,855
Joined today.

542
00:39:16,413 --> 00:39:16,814
See you.

543
00:39:23,836 --> 00:39:25,456
''Om Computer Namaha"

544
00:39:25,566 --> 00:39:26,045
Hey...

545
00:39:26,996 --> 00:39:28,637
I will be very disciplined.
Don't be afraid.

546
00:39:34,684 --> 00:39:40,524
Are you thinking that why
i'm not married yet, though handsome?

547
00:39:41,894 --> 00:39:43,135
It's simply because,

548
00:39:43,575 --> 00:39:44,936
I don't believe in "Love marriage."

549
00:39:45,815 --> 00:39:46,815
Because everyone cheats.

550
00:39:48,646 --> 00:39:50,407
Do you have any...?

551
00:39:51,484 --> 00:39:52,084
How?

552
00:39:54,927 --> 00:39:55,488
Love?

553
00:39:56,688 --> 00:39:57,648
This and that!

554
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,659
I will get it done.
Be calm till I come.

555
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:04,071
Come Selvam.

556
00:40:04,809 --> 00:40:06,489
Didn't get the deceased yet?

557
00:40:06,757 --> 00:40:09,239
Singapore flight is delayed.
No other relatives to come.

558
00:40:09,678 --> 00:40:11,278
Will start the funeral
as soon as arrival.

559
00:40:11,456 --> 00:40:12,675
His wife is inside.

560
00:40:12,954 --> 00:40:14,354
I am the undertaker of everything.

561
00:40:14,612 --> 00:40:16,428
Okay, you call me later.
I will be back.

562
00:40:16,632 --> 00:40:18,799
Selvam, just wait.
Have a tender coconut.

563
00:40:18,824 --> 00:40:19,385
Give him.

564
00:40:21,804 --> 00:40:22,565
How does it taste?

565
00:40:23,365 --> 00:40:24,165
"Excellent."

566
00:40:24,436 --> 00:40:25,516
It's from our grove.

567
00:40:26,472 --> 00:40:27,672
When did you buy a grove?

568
00:40:28,285 --> 00:40:30,005
Brother's grove is like mine.

569
00:40:30,579 --> 00:40:33,139
Hey, you must seek my permission
to cut tender coconuts.

570
00:40:33,624 --> 00:40:34,504
What?

571
00:40:35,095 --> 00:40:37,215
You must seek my permission.
I am the authority for it.

572
00:40:37,215 --> 00:40:38,255
Get lost, you nut.

573
00:40:38,335 --> 00:40:40,712
It's you,to get my permission
to step into the grove.

574
00:40:40,775 --> 00:40:41,775
when he left to Malaysia.

575
00:40:41,775 --> 00:40:43,176
brother gave the authority
of the grove to me,

576
00:40:43,176 --> 00:40:45,855
Hey, you are a thief in own house.

577
00:40:45,855 --> 00:40:47,495
How he entrust you to give the authority?

578
00:40:47,639 --> 00:40:48,670
I am his relative.

579
00:40:48,695 --> 00:40:49,256
Is it?

580
00:40:49,576 --> 00:40:51,830
He handed over to me
with dubious on you.

581
00:40:51,855 --> 00:40:54,536
if you think of stepping into the grove,
I will chop your legs.

582
00:40:54,536 --> 00:40:54,975
Hey...
Hey...

583
00:40:54,975 --> 00:40:55,856
My legs are here only,
chop now

584
00:40:55,856 --> 00:40:56,895
Hey, don't you have sense?
Creating ruckus in a death house.

585
00:40:56,895 --> 00:40:57,855
He talks absurd,

586
00:40:57,855 --> 00:40:59,226
Who is absurd?

587
00:40:59,312 --> 00:41:02,950
Come, let's see.
Stop it.

588
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:04,751
When you behave tauntly in my presence,
What respect do I have?

589
00:41:05,399 --> 00:41:06,079
What's the problem now?

590
00:41:06,413 --> 00:41:07,497
You ought to know who holds
the authority of the grove, isn't it?

591
00:41:07,638 --> 00:41:10,037
Make a call to brother.
Will settle it right now.

592
00:41:11,062 --> 00:41:13,444
Bro, are we burying or
cremating the deceased.

593
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:14,976
Cremate him first.
Hey...

594
00:41:14,976 --> 00:41:16,616
Wait.
What? Wait.

595
00:41:17,226 --> 00:41:18,947
Hey, you call him now.

596
00:41:19,821 --> 00:41:20,580
Call him.

597
00:41:22,023 --> 00:41:22,976
Don't have the balance.

598
00:41:22,976 --> 00:41:24,816
Poor fellow needs grove.

599
00:41:26,173 --> 00:41:26,654
Tell me the number

600
00:41:31,824 --> 00:41:32,424
Hello...

601
00:41:32,635 --> 00:41:33,314
Brother!

602
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:34,880
Yes, who are you?

603
00:41:35,015 --> 00:41:36,398
I'm Gopi,
"Member of panchayat board."

604
00:41:36,737 --> 00:41:39,138
Oh, Gopi!
What's the matter?

605
00:41:39,226 --> 00:41:43,616
A cat-fight going on between
your brother-in-law and Malaiswamy.

606
00:41:43,851 --> 00:41:47,608
In whose authority you left
the new coconut grove?

607
00:41:47,921 --> 00:41:50,176
With Malaiswamy.
What happened?

608
00:41:50,359 --> 00:41:52,256
No...nothing...
It's ISD!

609
00:41:52,256 --> 00:41:55,376
He stated clearly.
Get lost.

610
00:41:55,719 --> 00:41:57,159
Crooked relation.

611
00:41:59,844 --> 00:42:02,484
What's the conversation
about Malaiswamy?

612
00:42:02,851 --> 00:42:03,440
What's the matter?

613
00:42:03,752 --> 00:42:06,992
I told him to take care of
the new grove.That's it.

614
00:42:10,262 --> 00:42:11,183
Are you mad?

615
00:42:11,914 --> 00:42:14,561
My brother is taking care of
our properties for long time,isn't it?

616
00:42:14,804 --> 00:42:18,737
Why have you changed it to
Malaiswamy suddenly?

617
00:42:20,269 --> 00:42:22,029
He was stumbling to lead his life.

618
00:42:22,328 --> 00:42:25,248
So, I only told him to take care
of the grove for his earnings.

619
00:42:26,575 --> 00:42:28,015
God!
Serve the food.

620
00:42:28,955 --> 00:42:33,074
I expected all these confusions
when you left alone.

621
00:42:33,897 --> 00:42:35,137
Malaiswamy?

622
00:42:35,813 --> 00:42:38,052
Will anyone leave the "monkey
to guard pancakes?"

623
00:42:38,937 --> 00:42:40,176
Oh no!!

624
00:42:42,801 --> 00:42:44,281
Leave it.
I will leave.

625
00:42:46,909 --> 00:42:48,310
Your phone rings.

626
00:42:49,399 --> 00:42:51,160
Must be MLA's call.

627
00:42:52,001 --> 00:42:52,762
Call from abroad.

628
00:42:53,688 --> 00:42:54,247
Hello...

629
00:42:55,124 --> 00:42:56,043
Gopi,
-Brother,

630
00:42:56,375 --> 00:42:58,776
My wife had given all the authority
to her brother.

631
00:42:58,776 --> 00:43:00,095
Let it remain the same.
Okay?

632
00:43:00,679 --> 00:43:02,198
How is it?
Serve the food.

633
00:43:11,226 --> 00:43:13,746
Have you understood that
my brother-in-law is not a fool.

634
00:43:14,136 --> 00:43:16,855
I have never seen a fool like you.

635
00:43:17,158 --> 00:43:19,037
Why do you drag me in between?

636
00:43:19,404 --> 00:43:20,524
Hey, it was you who said!

637
00:43:20,821 --> 00:43:21,221
Yes.

638
00:43:21,711 --> 00:43:24,936
Malaisamy will meet your mother now
and pass the buck on me.

639
00:43:25,289 --> 00:43:28,049
Immediately,
oldster will call and blow off me

640
00:43:28,616 --> 00:43:32,904
Already she chides me
by saying you are henpecked.

641
00:43:33,435 --> 00:43:35,995
Now you did this too.

642
00:43:36,625 --> 00:43:38,978
Hey, be calm.
shall i have food or not?

643
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:42,389
Whatever you do,
ends up in spat.

644
00:43:42,959 --> 00:43:44,599
Finally, you will become good to all.

645
00:43:45,182 --> 00:43:46,623
Only my name gets taunt.

646
00:43:47,693 --> 00:43:49,854
Call now.
I said call now.

647
00:44:04,175 --> 00:44:06,014
Yes brother...
-Gopi

648
00:44:06,421 --> 00:44:09,296
let malaisamy take authority
of the new grove.

649
00:44:10,468 --> 00:44:15,056
Then, any decision
taken in my home is mine.

650
00:44:15,614 --> 00:44:17,054
"Solely mine."

651
00:44:17,269 --> 00:44:19,828
Hey, will you change your mind
so often?

652
00:44:20,343 --> 00:44:21,622
Must take a stern decision.

653
00:44:22,168 --> 00:44:22,927
Foolish guy...

654
00:44:24,484 --> 00:44:26,343
Hey, who are you to interfere
in my personal affairs?

655
00:44:26,391 --> 00:44:27,351
Pig in the tale...

656
00:44:27,758 --> 00:44:29,278
How dare you yell at me?

657
00:44:29,475 --> 00:44:32,014
Your entire family is
"pigs in the tale."

658
00:44:33,794 --> 00:44:37,313
Do you derogate my sister?
I will hit you.

659
00:44:37,338 --> 00:44:38,898
You dig for petty money,

660
00:44:38,986 --> 00:44:40,507
Dare to derogate my boss?

661
00:44:40,687 --> 00:44:41,336
Don't leave him.

662
00:44:41,336 --> 00:44:42,896
Dare to hit our brother?

663
00:44:42,896 --> 00:44:43,975
Dare to hit our brother?

664
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,695
Mindless he is!

665
00:44:45,781 --> 00:44:47,535
I will come with support
of my guys.

666
00:44:47,535 --> 00:44:48,855
Get them
We will stay here.

667
00:44:50,882 --> 00:44:52,640
Member Bro, are we burying or
cremating the deceased?

668
00:44:52,665 --> 00:44:53,546
Chop into pieces.

669
00:44:54,656 --> 00:44:56,728
Sir, what about the water closet
to be built?

670
00:44:56,805 --> 00:44:59,486
Go away...
Go on with open defecation.

671
00:45:06,596 --> 00:45:07,235
Bye...

672
00:45:25,327 --> 00:45:26,527
Vagabond!

673
00:45:26,664 --> 00:45:27,328
Everything gone.

674
00:45:27,624 --> 00:45:29,344
Will you ride the bicycle
looking at stars?

675
00:45:29,484 --> 00:45:30,169
Castor bean...

676
00:45:30,304 --> 00:45:32,329
It's not me,
That person...

677
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:33,270
Who is that?

678
00:45:35,085 --> 00:45:35,486
Hey,

679
00:45:36,455 --> 00:45:38,296
I will snuff you.
Don't play fun of me.

680
00:45:38,538 --> 00:45:40,777
Collect all the things
to the basket.

681
00:45:40,802 --> 00:45:41,561
No...no...

682
00:45:41,615 --> 00:45:42,816
Where are you going?

683
00:45:42,816 --> 00:46:30,215
(National Anthem by School children)

684
00:46:30,285 --> 00:46:32,005
Hey, stop there.

685
00:46:35,284 --> 00:46:38,284
Give me the money for the plunder.
Why do you make me to run?

686
00:46:42,082 --> 00:46:49,601
No...no....

687
00:46:49,896 --> 00:46:51,137
Give me...

688
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:04,310
Shanthi!
Shanthi!

689
00:47:05,129 --> 00:47:06,369
Get me water.

690
00:47:06,808 --> 00:47:08,513
Started too early, bro?

691
00:47:08,538 --> 00:47:10,935
Am I drinking alcohol
in your father's hard earned money?

692
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:12,539
Look at your job.

693
00:47:12,672 --> 00:47:13,953
Shanthi!

694
00:47:21,619 --> 00:47:23,746
Shanthi, get me water.

695
00:47:29,249 --> 00:47:30,648
Piety...

696
00:47:30,757 --> 00:47:32,558
Is it the right place to
play with ball?

697
00:47:35,163 --> 00:47:36,803
You drained the entire milk!

698
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:38,946
Hey...

699
00:47:39,058 --> 00:47:39,509
Get lost.

700
00:47:39,566 --> 00:47:41,726
I will show my power inside.

701
00:47:48,617 --> 00:47:50,223
What are you doing?

702
00:47:50,387 --> 00:47:52,055
Placing lumps for your
mother's phantom...

703
00:47:52,055 --> 00:47:53,496
Go away,
Always...

704
00:47:53,936 --> 00:47:56,457
Are you mad?
Who is mad?

705
00:47:57,074 --> 00:48:00,735
I will smash your head.
Get out.

706
00:48:01,151 --> 00:48:01,982
Crazy fellow!

707
00:48:02,007 --> 00:48:02,607
Go away.

708
00:48:02,835 --> 00:48:06,434
Either you watch "Soap operas"
or "Big boss" shows!

709
00:48:06,637 --> 00:48:08,237
It has become a rote to you.

710
00:48:08,310 --> 00:48:11,029
Will you watch the idiot box?

711
00:48:14,092 --> 00:48:16,012
Hey, be careful.

712
00:48:17,815 --> 00:48:18,176
Hello...

713
00:48:18,935 --> 00:48:19,735
Where are you?

714
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:20,481
At the shop.

715
00:48:20,855 --> 00:48:23,176
Your brother- in law is
mocking your sister.

716
00:48:23,201 --> 00:48:23,801
Come soon.

717
00:48:24,414 --> 00:48:25,253
Let's go.

718
00:48:25,695 --> 00:48:26,856
Hello...
Hello...

719
00:48:30,183 --> 00:48:30,495
Yes brother,

720
00:48:30,495 --> 00:48:31,976
I left yesterday at dawn
and stayed till dusk.

721
00:48:31,976 --> 00:48:32,976
Brother, take it.

722
00:48:32,976 --> 00:48:33,936
Don't know what to do?

723
00:48:34,215 --> 00:48:35,255
I will buy soda

724
00:48:35,402 --> 00:48:37,082
But the job didn't get over.

725
00:48:38,044 --> 00:48:39,448
"As there is no sufficient balance,

726
00:48:39,495 --> 00:48:41,256
Your call is rejected.

727
00:48:41,294 --> 00:48:42,614
Recharge soon."

728
00:48:46,869 --> 00:48:48,030
Brother, give me a soda.

729
00:48:49,998 --> 00:48:52,097
Sakthi, recharge for 50 bucks.

730
00:48:52,122 --> 00:48:52,962
Tell me your number.

731
00:48:55,816 --> 00:48:57,696
Hello, I asked for soda.

732
00:48:58,856 --> 00:49:00,063
I asked for soda.

733
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:01,020
Hey, just wait.

734
00:49:02,231 --> 00:49:02,950
It's me who came first.

735
00:49:03,495 --> 00:49:05,256
Give me a soda
and then do recharge.

736
00:49:05,256 --> 00:49:06,056
Hey, just wait.

737
00:49:06,412 --> 00:49:06,901
Why must I wait?

738
00:49:06,926 --> 00:49:08,167
You dare to call me,
"hey,"without respect?

739
00:49:08,364 --> 00:49:09,364
What respect do you deserve?

740
00:49:09,552 --> 00:49:11,573
First and foremost, you learn to
respect elders. Scarecrow...

741
00:49:11,598 --> 00:49:12,717
Who is scare crow?

742
00:49:12,742 --> 00:49:13,502
What can you do?
Get lost.

743
00:49:13,527 --> 00:49:14,487
Who are you?

744
00:49:14,535 --> 00:49:16,655
What? What can you do?
Get lost.

745
00:49:16,655 --> 00:49:17,576
Get lost.

746
00:49:17,576 --> 00:49:19,016
Write the number.

747
00:49:19,224 --> 00:49:20,871
Give the soda and then recharge.

748
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:21,135
What the hell is soda?

749
00:49:21,135 --> 00:49:22,253
First, do recharge.

750
00:49:22,784 --> 00:49:23,736
You bald head!
Take your hand.

751
00:49:23,862 --> 00:49:25,935
What can you do?
Hey, I came first.

752
00:49:26,091 --> 00:49:28,611
Go away.
Get him.

753
00:49:30,296 --> 00:49:31,464
What can you do?

754
00:49:31,489 --> 00:49:32,369
You will die if I hit.

755
00:49:32,402 --> 00:49:33,198
Don't go.

756
00:49:33,223 --> 00:49:34,392
Why do you arouse?

757
00:49:34,417 --> 00:49:35,856
Go away.

758
00:49:36,745 --> 00:49:37,425
Go away.

759
00:49:37,777 --> 00:49:38,456
Why do you shout here?

760
00:49:38,678 --> 00:49:40,991
I have come across
so many rogues like you.

761
00:49:41,130 --> 00:49:43,231
Sakthi, recharge for 50 bucks.

762
00:49:43,597 --> 00:49:44,597
Yes, coming.

763
00:49:47,044 --> 00:49:47,598
What dear?

764
00:49:47,716 --> 00:49:48,536
Got panic?

765
00:49:48,942 --> 00:49:51,071
We, the youngsters will spat today
and ally tomorrow.

766
00:49:51,196 --> 00:49:51,996
Nothing to worry.

767
00:49:52,271 --> 00:49:53,751
When you get caught in my hands.

768
00:49:53,775 --> 00:49:55,376
I will dump you then.
Come on...

769
00:49:55,376 --> 00:49:55,895
Sit down.

770
00:49:57,270 --> 00:49:59,390
Is he good enough to
compete with us?

771
00:50:00,115 --> 00:50:01,675
Cool dude...
Cool...

772
00:50:04,687 --> 00:50:07,287
Are you cool?
Yes.

773
00:50:11,296 --> 00:50:15,296
Hey...
Will you leave from here?

774
00:50:15,611 --> 00:50:16,532
I will kill you.

775
00:50:18,616 --> 00:50:20,936
Hey...
Lift him… Lift him.

776
00:50:20,936 --> 00:50:22,296
Who are you?
Leave him.

777
00:50:22,296 --> 00:50:23,136
Go away.

778
00:50:23,136 --> 00:50:24,376
leave it.

779
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:26,047
Brother, leave it.

780
00:50:26,072 --> 00:50:27,752
Brother, listen to me.
Leave it.

781
00:50:52,499 --> 00:50:54,059
Selvam, hit him.

782
00:52:03,895 --> 00:52:06,176
Hit him dude,
Hit him.

783
00:52:07,591 --> 00:52:09,072
Go on,dude.

784
00:52:09,358 --> 00:52:10,318
Atleast hit him once.

785
00:52:11,683 --> 00:52:12,483
Go dude.

786
00:52:25,455 --> 00:52:26,856
Selvam!
Selvam!

787
00:52:27,285 --> 00:52:28,124
hit him.

788
00:52:39,536 --> 00:52:41,256
Hey, leave him.
Hey...

789
00:52:43,416 --> 00:52:44,336
Hmm...

790
00:53:08,247 --> 00:53:10,271
"You won over him,
That's enough."

791
00:53:10,835 --> 00:53:11,955
Go...

792
00:53:20,716 --> 00:53:22,376
Selvam!
Selvam!

793
00:53:22,825 --> 00:53:25,255
Selvam!
Get up.

794
00:53:25,474 --> 00:53:26,551
Dress up.

795
00:53:26,732 --> 00:53:27,171
Take it.

796
00:53:28,656 --> 00:53:30,377
Someone take him to hospital.

797
00:53:40,495 --> 00:53:41,294
Give it.

798
00:53:43,162 --> 00:53:46,482
Hey dude, we will come
wherever if you wish to revenge.

799
00:53:47,138 --> 00:53:49,058
Drink Soda.
No...

800
00:53:50,042 --> 00:53:50,950
Take your hand.

801
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:52,296
Put on your Waders.

802
00:54:04,183 --> 00:54:05,863
Whoever it is,

803
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:08,290
Unless i take avenge on
those who hit me,

804
00:54:08,516 --> 00:54:09,476
I will not sport Waders.

805
00:54:12,252 --> 00:54:14,652
It's okay with Waders.
Let's go to hospital.

806
00:54:34,232 --> 00:54:37,192
It's enough.Enough of it.
You take rest.

807
00:54:47,244 --> 00:54:47,804
Hey,

808
00:54:48,204 --> 00:54:49,924
why do you moan as
if a death occured?

809
00:54:50,644 --> 00:54:52,044
It's clear to me.

810
00:54:52,642 --> 00:54:53,682
The one who came is arrogant.

811
00:54:54,449 --> 00:54:55,650
His hands are like iron rods.

812
00:54:56,483 --> 00:54:57,764
He hit me once.

813
00:54:58,443 --> 00:54:59,404
Thunder spattered in my eyes.

814
00:55:03,251 --> 00:55:05,452
A mask of turmeric paste
will heal the wounds.

815
00:55:07,357 --> 00:55:09,164
Don't go out for two weeks.

816
00:55:09,763 --> 00:55:12,244
Everyone will keep on enquiring.

817
00:55:13,770 --> 00:55:16,730
It's common among guys.
Hitting and getting back.

818
00:55:17,506 --> 00:55:18,626
Forget whatever happened so far.

819
00:55:20,389 --> 00:55:21,709
Don't you know well about me
from my childhood?

820
00:55:25,057 --> 00:55:26,737
Either in school or in streets,

821
00:55:27,233 --> 00:55:28,673
Ever I made any issue with others?

822
00:55:30,768 --> 00:55:32,728
Ever I spoke in anger to anyone?

823
00:55:33,611 --> 00:55:34,091
Not at all...

824
00:55:38,801 --> 00:55:39,920
Damn sure, I will pay back in spades.

825
00:55:41,603 --> 00:55:43,123
Gopi,Why are you silent?

826
00:55:44,364 --> 00:55:46,123
I stopped baffling in other's business

827
00:55:46,525 --> 00:55:48,285
Then why are you here,sitting idle?
Move on...

828
00:55:51,484 --> 00:55:52,163
Selvam,

829
00:55:53,123 --> 00:55:55,523
Apart from "Angel stores" owner
and "Footwear shop's" Malaiswamy

830
00:55:55,523 --> 00:55:57,964
nobody heard your vow of not
wearing Waders.

831
00:55:58,673 --> 00:55:59,913
I will manage them both.

832
00:56:00,669 --> 00:56:02,668
Disown the decision you took
in outrage.

833
00:56:02,809 --> 00:56:03,810
Use the Waders.

834
00:56:13,053 --> 00:56:14,052
I was born to "only father."

835
00:56:14,673 --> 00:56:15,513
Sitting here.

836
00:56:15,844 --> 00:56:16,683
"National Shanmugam"

837
00:56:35,992 --> 00:56:36,633
Selvam,

838
00:56:37,364 --> 00:56:38,243
please come here.

839
00:56:47,403 --> 00:56:47,963
What's that father?

840
00:56:47,963 --> 00:56:49,564
Subramani wants to talk with you.

841
00:56:50,338 --> 00:56:51,724
Sir, I am Subramani.

842
00:56:51,911 --> 00:56:53,350
I don't have any content
to talk about.

843
00:56:53,375 --> 00:56:55,095
Pitchumani, he wants to talk.

844
00:56:55,235 --> 00:56:56,114
Valli's father.

845
00:56:57,914 --> 00:56:59,395
What's that in your forehead?

846
00:57:01,843 --> 00:57:02,444
Nothing.

847
00:57:02,843 --> 00:57:03,723
You mean nothing.

848
00:57:08,921 --> 00:57:09,881
What's the reason
you have come?

849
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:11,778
Tell him.

850
00:57:14,866 --> 00:57:16,826
I know you from your childhood.

851
00:57:18,484 --> 00:57:20,444
what's cooking up between
"you" and "Valli"

852
00:57:20,723 --> 00:57:22,643
is known to me as known to all.

853
00:57:27,043 --> 00:57:29,164
She has got a
good marriage proposal.

854
00:57:30,546 --> 00:57:33,027
It's a fact,that her desire
is to lead life with you.

855
00:57:34,084 --> 00:57:36,803
But she understands
the certainty now.

856
00:57:37,006 --> 00:57:38,926
She changed a bit.

857
00:57:41,773 --> 00:57:42,493
What's this?

858
00:57:43,564 --> 00:57:44,404
It's better,

859
00:57:44,813 --> 00:57:45,932
both of you discuss

860
00:57:46,003 --> 00:57:47,803
and favour a wise decision mutually.

861
00:57:53,018 --> 00:57:53,858
You talk to her.

862
00:58:13,403 --> 00:58:13,883
Hello...

863
00:58:16,371 --> 00:58:16,731
It's me.

864
00:58:19,444 --> 00:58:19,843
Selvam!

865
00:58:22,163 --> 00:58:23,403
I'm totally in confused state.

866
00:58:26,044 --> 00:58:30,924
I don't know whether
I can forget you.

867
00:58:33,923 --> 00:58:34,883
I am a coward.

868
00:58:36,923 --> 00:58:37,803
A wimpy.

869
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:44,321
But everything will be
good for us.

870
00:58:52,643 --> 00:58:53,924
You chucked me so easily!

871
00:58:55,604 --> 00:58:55,884
It's okay.

872
00:59:33,324 --> 00:59:35,323
Still you have it here.
Throw it in trash.

873
00:59:35,723 --> 00:59:37,971
I keep it as a reference of
size to customers.

874
00:59:37,996 --> 00:59:41,235
For that,
can't you use actresses photos?

875
00:59:41,642 --> 00:59:43,483
Don't you have any work there?

876
00:59:43,724 --> 00:59:44,684
You are snuffing me.

877
00:59:44,938 --> 00:59:46,138
I need to take a
passport size photo.

878
00:59:46,685 --> 00:59:47,450
For what?

879
00:59:47,626 --> 00:59:48,425
To buy a SIM card.

880
00:59:49,803 --> 00:59:50,524
Come in.

881
00:59:57,779 --> 00:59:58,100
Friend,

882
00:59:59,164 --> 01:00:00,683
Why don't you amend
your vow?

883
01:00:05,018 --> 01:00:06,778
When you plan to take
avenge on him,

884
01:00:07,003 --> 01:00:08,203
If he wins again,

885
01:00:08,595 --> 01:00:10,674
Then you will vow not
to wear shirt.

886
01:00:11,409 --> 01:00:13,370
When you plan again to take
avenge and he wins,

887
01:00:13,690 --> 01:00:15,649
Then you will vow not to
wear dhoti.

888
01:00:16,204 --> 01:00:18,284
If you go on to take
avenge on him and he wins,

889
01:00:18,803 --> 01:00:20,123
What vow will you take
not to wear?

890
01:00:20,683 --> 01:00:21,523
That's why,

891
01:00:22,163 --> 01:00:23,723
I say to reckon with it.
Chin up...

892
01:00:25,130 --> 01:00:25,730
Shoulder down...

893
01:00:26,603 --> 01:00:27,163
Chin down...

894
01:00:28,658 --> 01:00:29,298
Eyes open...

895
01:00:30,323 --> 01:00:31,643
One...two...

896
01:00:35,057 --> 01:00:36,057
Nothing to reckon with.

897
01:00:38,003 --> 01:00:39,244
Damn sure,
I will hit him back.

898
01:00:41,260 --> 01:00:42,420
If so,his name is "Vellaiyappan."

899
01:00:42,483 --> 01:00:43,202
He dwells in Meikarai.

900
01:00:43,272 --> 01:00:44,632
He is a welder,
in "Mary Madha shop."

901
01:00:55,580 --> 01:00:57,780
I won't leave.

902
01:00:59,938 --> 01:01:01,299
I promise

903
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:03,203
Are my citizens fools?

904
01:01:03,302 --> 01:01:04,204
Size Eight Paragon Footwear.
Hey,stop.

905
01:01:04,204 --> 01:01:04,763
What dude?

906
01:01:04,763 --> 01:01:06,964
Size Eight Paragon Footwear.
Hey,stop.

907
01:01:07,387 --> 01:01:08,187
Get Size Eight Paragon.
Okay.

908
01:01:08,443 --> 01:01:09,083
Now you can shout.

909
01:01:10,145 --> 01:01:12,065
see,where our nation is!

910
01:01:13,564 --> 01:01:13,804
Hey,

911
01:01:14,164 --> 01:01:15,124
Selvam is going to pay back
the old score!

912
01:01:19,324 --> 01:01:19,804
Let's go.

913
01:01:21,883 --> 01:01:22,883
Oldster,take care of my shop.

914
01:01:22,883 --> 01:01:23,644
Do you own a shop?

915
01:01:26,949 --> 01:01:27,949
Take the vehicle.
Take it.

916
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:29,800
Selvam is going to hit back.
Let's go.

917
01:01:30,044 --> 01:01:30,763
Come...
Come...

918
01:02:32,764 --> 01:02:33,124
What?

919
01:02:36,404 --> 01:02:37,564
Is Vellaiyappan working here?

920
01:02:37,857 --> 01:02:40,338
He got a job in dubai.
Left today morning.

921
01:02:41,284 --> 01:02:42,964
Not sending out the workers now.

922
01:02:49,883 --> 01:02:51,044
It's a bootless errand.

923
01:02:52,449 --> 01:02:53,770
That's all.
It's over.

924
01:02:53,957 --> 01:02:55,757
He can't sport with
waders at all.

925
01:02:55,804 --> 01:02:56,884
Go...go...
Go to your jobs.

926
01:03:27,574 --> 01:03:28,219
Two cups of tea!

927
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:30,639
Master, I have twenty bucks.

928
01:03:31,138 --> 01:03:32,899
Is it?
Two parottas then.

929
01:03:42,619 --> 01:03:43,419
Greetings Master!

930
01:03:44,458 --> 01:03:45,099
Master!

931
01:03:46,856 --> 01:03:49,257
I am Madhavan,
Native of Palakad.

932
01:03:50,019 --> 01:03:50,859
Resides in Meikara.

933
01:03:51,498 --> 01:03:53,299
I must punch a few persons.

934
01:03:54,312 --> 01:03:55,591
Must castigate them

935
01:03:55,945 --> 01:03:57,705
Will you teach me?

936
01:03:58,699 --> 01:03:59,379
Parotta...

937
01:04:00,138 --> 01:04:03,619
"Kungfu",is a martial art.
Not to punch others.

938
01:04:03,762 --> 01:04:05,201
It's also a matter of defence only,
Master.

939
01:04:06,058 --> 01:04:08,058
When my sister leaves from school,

940
01:04:08,499 --> 01:04:10,179
Rogues in auto stand,

941
01:04:10,954 --> 01:04:12,354
Tease her by taking photos.

942
01:04:13,736 --> 01:04:14,816
When I questioned them,

943
01:04:16,504 --> 01:04:17,544
They fractured my hand.

944
01:04:18,449 --> 01:04:20,408
Feel ashamed to be a brother.

945
01:04:23,379 --> 01:04:23,938
Isn't it?

946
01:04:27,579 --> 01:04:28,859
Master, do you want chest fry?
No...

947
01:04:30,161 --> 01:04:30,960
A chest fry!

948
01:04:45,778 --> 01:04:46,779
Divide in two.

949
01:04:49,338 --> 01:04:50,019
Steady.

950
01:04:51,282 --> 01:04:51,522
Bow.

951
01:04:53,377 --> 01:04:53,777
Get back.

952
01:04:54,881 --> 01:04:55,961
Okay, jogging.
Jogging.

953
01:04:57,259 --> 01:04:57,699
Front and back.

954
01:04:59,402 --> 01:04:59,801
Side.

955
01:05:02,938 --> 01:05:03,738
Reverse punch.

956
01:05:06,378 --> 01:05:08,098
Selvam, please stop.

957
01:05:10,419 --> 01:05:12,699
Will you drop me at temple?
Must attend a wedding.

958
01:05:16,859 --> 01:05:17,539
Whose wedding brother?

959
01:05:18,339 --> 01:05:19,539
Pitchumani's daughter,

960
01:05:20,139 --> 01:05:21,858
Her name...

961
01:05:22,673 --> 01:05:23,233
Shenbagavalli!

962
01:05:31,819 --> 01:05:42,298
(Chanting Mantras)

963
01:05:42,298 --> 01:05:43,539
Bang the drums!

964
01:05:43,539 --> 01:05:47,019
(Chanting Mantras)

965
01:06:21,529 --> 01:06:24,368
"Nay ray of sun! Nay fall of rain!"

966
01:06:24,619 --> 01:06:27,378
"But the rainbow has loom!"

967
01:06:27,658 --> 01:06:30,418
"It has become void here,

968
01:06:30,699 --> 01:06:33,499
Even the vault of heaven is unseen now! "

969
01:06:33,699 --> 01:06:39,819
"Bouncing up,
bending down and the blues is love!"

970
01:06:40,258 --> 01:06:45,819
"Anguish in the heart pricks
like caltrop bristle."

971
01:06:46,116 --> 01:06:51,756
"Ever yearning for you,
the beauteous smirk which yank me!"

972
01:06:52,241 --> 01:06:57,962
"Ever pining to heed per diem,"
must purge my love to you!"

973
01:06:58,378 --> 01:07:00,819
"Come closer, christen me"

974
01:07:01,059 --> 01:07:03,339
"Fingers entwined".

975
01:07:49,378 --> 01:07:49,938
Where are you going?

976
01:07:51,979 --> 01:07:52,419
To shop.

977
01:07:55,177 --> 01:07:56,536
It's not shop.
"Studio"

978
01:08:01,058 --> 01:08:02,257
You can go after
the rain recede.

979
01:08:20,938 --> 01:08:22,578
Did she delude you?

980
01:08:23,859 --> 01:08:24,538
No...no...

981
01:08:25,178 --> 01:08:26,298
I only decided that
it's not a "right match."

982
01:08:36,178 --> 01:08:36,698
Hey Vidhya,

983
01:08:37,848 --> 01:08:38,169
Hi...

984
01:08:39,379 --> 01:08:39,699
Hi...

985
01:08:41,019 --> 01:08:41,578
Brother, just a minute.

986
01:08:43,698 --> 01:08:44,538
Hey, what's up?

987
01:08:44,859 --> 01:08:46,179
It's neither "whats app"
nor "face book."

988
01:08:46,378 --> 01:08:47,019
I am going to college.

989
01:08:47,338 --> 01:08:48,178
Why are you here?

990
01:08:48,291 --> 01:08:49,451
I came for flex printing.

991
01:08:49,983 --> 01:08:50,742
Will you take juice?

992
01:08:51,027 --> 01:08:52,088
Don't want.
I will be late.

993
01:08:52,273 --> 01:08:53,433
Something sticking on
your mouth.

994
01:08:53,898 --> 01:08:54,499
This side...
This side...

995
01:08:56,139 --> 01:08:56,979
Had puffs.

996
01:08:57,459 --> 01:08:58,978
Makes us embarrassing if we eat.

997
01:09:00,898 --> 01:09:02,618
Okay, time up for my class.
I am leaving.

998
01:09:02,791 --> 01:09:03,954
Okay. Bye.
-bye.

999
01:09:03,979 --> 01:09:04,779
I too have many works.
Bye.

1000
01:09:10,858 --> 01:09:11,538
How was the movie?

1001
01:09:11,538 --> 01:09:12,498
Watch it.

1002
01:09:27,099 --> 01:09:28,498
Don't stare.
It's me only...

1003
01:09:31,777 --> 01:09:32,737
Don't tell my dad.

1004
01:09:33,219 --> 01:09:34,338
You too don't tell him.
Hmm...

1005
01:09:37,729 --> 01:09:39,408
What about the statutory warning?
It will come now.

1006
01:09:45,738 --> 01:09:46,299
A cup of tea.

1007
01:09:56,059 --> 01:09:56,859
Hey Malaiswamy,

1008
01:09:57,312 --> 01:09:57,993
what are you looking at?

1009
01:09:58,296 --> 01:09:59,177
Checked whether he has put on?

1010
01:09:59,538 --> 01:10:00,339
Is it brief?

1011
01:10:00,778 --> 01:10:01,858
No, it's footwear.

1012
01:10:02,499 --> 01:10:03,459
Look at your job,castor bean.

1013
01:10:05,458 --> 01:10:06,339
A lentil ball too.

1014
01:10:07,739 --> 01:10:10,419
Indians who migrated
to Arab countries,

1015
01:10:10,858 --> 01:10:14,898
Will be sent back by the government
because of lack of jobs.

1016
01:10:15,019 --> 01:10:20,538
18,000 Indians from Dubai
will be sent back.

1017
01:10:20,795 --> 01:10:25,435
Whereas,
3500 persons belongs to Tamilnadu.

1018
01:10:37,378 --> 01:10:37,978
Brother, just a minute.

1019
01:10:38,610 --> 01:10:42,091
Do you know the house of Vellaiyappan,
the welder in Mary Matha workshop?

1020
01:10:43,779 --> 01:10:44,739
Are you asking about
that reckless person?

1021
01:10:45,139 --> 01:10:45,778
Are you a policeman?

1022
01:10:46,218 --> 01:10:47,619
Do you know the house or not?

1023
01:10:48,538 --> 01:10:50,619
Go straight,
there stands a load- bearing stone,

1024
01:10:51,588 --> 01:10:54,108
take right at the a statue of a god.

1025
01:10:55,098 --> 01:10:58,219
If you go in the same way,
It leads to an adjacent mud road.

1026
01:10:58,498 --> 01:11:01,059
Straight from there,
His house is visible.

1027
01:11:09,058 --> 01:11:09,618
Who's that?

1028
01:11:11,178 --> 01:11:12,059
House of Vellaiyappan?

1029
01:11:12,525 --> 01:11:13,721
yes, it is.
Who are you?

1030
01:11:13,858 --> 01:11:14,259
His friend.

1031
01:11:15,058 --> 01:11:16,058
I am washing clothes.

1032
01:11:16,338 --> 01:11:17,698
Just wait.
I will come.

1033
01:11:39,499 --> 01:11:43,378
Known from TV news
that workers are sent back from Dubai.

1034
01:11:44,377 --> 01:11:46,937
Doesn't he have any problem?

1035
01:11:48,465 --> 01:11:49,185
God!

1036
01:11:49,696 --> 01:11:51,656
No,no problem to him.

1037
01:11:52,097 --> 01:11:55,736
They are sending back only a few.

1038
01:11:56,704 --> 01:11:59,385
Recently all the problems were out of way,
And we are breathing good.

1039
01:11:59,659 --> 01:12:03,258
His uncle tried his best
and got him visa.

1040
01:12:03,730 --> 01:12:06,250
Now I reside here
with my innocent daughter.

1041
01:12:13,299 --> 01:12:13,858
Catch it.

1042
01:12:14,019 --> 01:12:15,658
Hey, don't run.

1043
01:12:15,658 --> 01:12:17,059
Hey, who's that?

1044
01:12:17,059 --> 01:12:17,899
Hey,

1045
01:12:18,299 --> 01:12:20,458
Now only know
where the mangoes go?

1046
01:12:20,899 --> 01:12:22,738
If you get caught,
will crumble your bones.

1047
01:12:23,178 --> 01:12:25,299
Is it your own garden?

1048
01:12:28,539 --> 01:12:30,440
As he was in prison
for short span,

1049
01:12:30,819 --> 01:12:32,619
The marriage proposal of
my daughter was dropped.

1050
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:37,441
He spoke to me
day before yesterday.

1051
01:12:38,090 --> 01:12:39,489
He didn't utter anything about it.

1052
01:12:42,647 --> 01:12:44,168
Okay, I will leave.

1053
01:12:44,938 --> 01:12:47,139
Be seated.
Eat something and go.

1054
01:12:47,338 --> 01:12:48,178
It's okay.
I must leave.

1055
01:12:48,539 --> 01:12:50,500
You came home for first time.
Wait... wait

1056
01:13:05,768 --> 01:13:06,608
Take it.

1057
01:13:07,820 --> 01:13:08,740
Where are you from?

1058
01:13:09,859 --> 01:13:10,498
"Mom..."

1059
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:13,200
Yes.
I will be back.

1060
01:13:15,138 --> 01:13:17,659
What?
Isn't there anything to eat?

1061
01:13:18,161 --> 01:13:19,802
I kept mangoes for you.

1062
01:13:20,299 --> 01:13:21,579
Your brother's friend has come.

1063
01:13:21,939 --> 01:13:25,138
You know well
that I come home hungry.

1064
01:13:25,138 --> 01:13:26,778
He won't eat the whole.

1065
01:13:30,339 --> 01:13:32,818
Wait for sometime.
I will do upma for you.

1066
01:13:33,258 --> 01:13:35,019
How long will it take to do?

1067
01:13:35,218 --> 01:13:36,378
In matter of minutes.

1068
01:13:37,378 --> 01:13:38,539
Why did you give him
everything?

1069
01:13:38,651 --> 01:13:39,633
Isn't tea is enough?

1070
01:13:39,658 --> 01:13:41,058
Don't be louder.

1071
01:13:41,529 --> 01:13:42,569
Ma,I am leaving.

1072
01:13:48,449 --> 01:13:51,889
God! A gourmand born to me!

1073
01:14:00,138 --> 01:14:01,019
For me?

1074
01:14:07,498 --> 01:14:09,538
Dear friends, on 17th

1075
01:14:09,692 --> 01:14:11,898
of evening at 4,
near sivan temple,

1076
01:14:11,898 --> 01:14:14,139
We conduct a blood donation
awareness camp.

1077
01:14:14,279 --> 01:14:16,559
Those who are interested
can participate.

1078
01:14:20,199 --> 01:14:20,799
Okay.

1079
01:14:23,327 --> 01:14:25,728
You got it.
Yes.

1080
01:14:27,138 --> 01:14:28,459
Forward to all the groups.

1081
01:14:34,634 --> 01:14:35,354
Hey Malar,

1082
01:14:35,619 --> 01:14:38,419
Sandhya has sent her photo for"Aval vikatan"
magazine's cover page competition.

1083
01:14:38,727 --> 01:14:40,527
Hey mindless,
it's me who told her to send.

1084
01:14:40,649 --> 01:14:41,330
I am also sending.

1085
01:15:06,201 --> 01:15:07,002
Take the vehicle.
Take it.

1086
01:15:07,641 --> 01:15:10,481
I think he knows.
How does he know?

1087
01:15:11,154 --> 01:15:12,435
When it's a gospel truth known to all,
Doesn't he know?

1088
01:15:14,458 --> 01:15:16,018
Look at his face.
Does he look romantic?

1089
01:15:16,299 --> 01:15:17,338
So many spies here.

1090
01:15:21,538 --> 01:15:23,859
Sister, please move.

1091
01:15:26,301 --> 01:15:27,259
Vidhya...
Vidhya...

1092
01:15:27,477 --> 01:15:28,197
Hi,

1093
01:15:28,643 --> 01:15:30,963
How about the studio
in bazaar street of your place?

1094
01:15:31,338 --> 01:15:32,458
Is it "National studio?"
Yes.

1095
01:15:32,578 --> 01:15:33,898
Well and good.
Why do you ask?

1096
01:15:34,218 --> 01:15:34,978
I must take a photo.

1097
01:15:35,258 --> 01:15:36,538
For a magazine's
cover page competition.

1098
01:15:37,136 --> 01:15:39,095
Superb!
You will attain fame soon.

1099
01:15:39,258 --> 01:15:41,619
Why do you hit at me?
Better sit on my lap.

1100
01:15:42,682 --> 01:15:44,801
You would've told earlier.
Thanks sister.

1101
01:15:52,906 --> 01:15:54,266
Must do the framing for
ten photos by evening.

1102
01:15:54,291 --> 01:15:55,811
Don't know how?

1103
01:15:56,859 --> 01:15:57,898
Who are you?
Where are you going?

1104
01:16:00,658 --> 01:16:01,299
Who are you uncle?

1105
01:16:01,819 --> 01:16:02,379
Uncle?

1106
01:16:04,218 --> 01:16:04,819
Dear girl,

1107
01:16:05,619 --> 01:16:07,059
Two organisations are there in
upper floor,

1108
01:16:07,777 --> 01:16:10,056
One is "Sada arts"
Another one is "National Studios."

1109
01:16:10,258 --> 01:16:12,298
Owners of both the
organisations are here.

1110
01:16:12,537 --> 01:16:13,736
Whom do you want to meet?

1111
01:16:14,268 --> 01:16:15,067
I must go to studio.

1112
01:16:15,498 --> 01:16:16,738
Selvam, get her.

1113
01:16:17,460 --> 01:16:19,020
Uncle, order me a tea.
Okay.

1114
01:16:19,522 --> 01:16:21,281
Why do you talk in
old movie dialect?

1115
01:16:21,418 --> 01:16:22,458
Shouldn't forget the old.

1116
01:16:22,945 --> 01:16:25,305
Mirror is inside.
Fresh up.

1117
01:16:27,418 --> 01:16:29,578
Is thieves here?
What?

1118
01:16:30,361 --> 01:16:32,562
If I keep the bag,
will anyone steal it?

1119
01:16:32,818 --> 01:16:35,019
No one will steal it.
Keep there and come.

1120
01:16:54,739 --> 01:16:55,858
I will take if you are ready.

1121
01:17:08,253 --> 01:17:09,226
It's not passport size photo.

1122
01:17:11,538 --> 01:17:12,059
Then?

1123
01:17:12,561 --> 01:17:13,722
For "Aval vikatan" magazine's
cover page competition.

1124
01:17:14,298 --> 01:17:14,939
Look at this.

1125
01:17:20,224 --> 01:17:21,105
Similar to it...

1126
01:17:28,538 --> 01:17:32,179
You would've told me before.
It needs varied sort of lighting.

1127
01:17:57,218 --> 01:17:58,217
Show to me once.

1128
01:18:13,995 --> 01:18:14,634
Stand up now.

1129
01:18:21,898 --> 01:18:22,578
Now a pose.

1130
01:18:25,779 --> 01:18:26,698
Turn a little.

1131
01:18:28,016 --> 01:18:30,257
Still a little.
Not that...

1132
01:18:32,394 --> 01:18:33,833
Put your hair at back.

1133
01:18:47,899 --> 01:18:48,339
Chin up...

1134
01:18:49,299 --> 01:18:49,899
Shoulder down...

1135
01:18:51,098 --> 01:18:51,538
Chin down...

1136
01:18:52,498 --> 01:18:53,178
Eyes open...

1137
01:18:53,978 --> 01:18:54,459
Ready...

1138
01:19:06,738 --> 01:19:07,338
How is it?

1139
01:19:08,506 --> 01:19:08,907
Nice!

1140
01:19:09,739 --> 01:19:11,300
When the opacity is increased,

1141
01:19:11,393 --> 01:19:13,793
dodge and smudge are sharpened,

1142
01:19:14,019 --> 01:19:15,699
Then it will directly head
to the cover page.

1143
01:19:16,779 --> 01:19:17,499
Will get ready.

1144
01:19:18,482 --> 01:19:19,082
What's the size?

1145
01:19:24,569 --> 01:19:25,409
Size"?
Size"?

1146
01:19:27,419 --> 01:19:30,299
Don't you know this job thoroughly?

1147
01:19:45,379 --> 01:19:48,219
I am a "Lifetime member" in
"Tamilnadu photographers Association."

1148
01:19:50,459 --> 01:19:51,498
How can she ask me?

1149
01:19:55,899 --> 01:19:57,778
I took the camera in hand
after my schooling.

1150
01:19:59,739 --> 01:20:01,739
Not even a single photo
went out of focus.

1151
01:20:04,644 --> 01:20:05,980
How can she ask me?

1152
01:20:07,059 --> 01:20:09,619
Leave it.
She is a "smart girl."

1153
01:20:21,699 --> 01:20:27,258
(A song from "MJ" album.)

1154
01:20:46,542 --> 01:20:50,698
What does I know about music?
See now!

1155
01:20:50,698 --> 01:20:56,259
(A song from the movie, "SACHIN".)

1156
01:20:57,138 --> 01:21:00,339
“Even if disco rocks or kisco rocks,

1157
01:21:00,339 --> 01:21:03,178
This song won’t fade…”

1158
01:21:09,459 --> 01:21:12,778
“Even if Michael rocks or Madonna rocks,

1159
01:21:12,778 --> 01:21:15,899
The ghana song won’t fade…”

1160
01:21:22,339 --> 01:21:27,898
(A song from the movie, "VEDHALAM")

1161
01:21:51,339 --> 01:21:56,298
(A song from the movie, "BAASHA".)

1162
01:21:56,458 --> 01:21:58,298
I am the auto driver…

1163
01:21:58,298 --> 01:21:59,792
Known all the tracks

1164
01:21:59,817 --> 01:22:01,177
Honest in my deeds,

1165
01:22:01,202 --> 01:22:02,803
Have good company of friends,

1166
01:22:02,828 --> 01:22:04,199
Good in singing,

1167
01:22:04,224 --> 01:22:05,625
Born in the country of Gandhiji,

1168
01:22:05,650 --> 01:22:07,210
A good hunter when takes spear,

1169
01:22:07,235 --> 01:22:08,635
Related to simple minded persons,

1170
01:22:08,660 --> 01:22:11,059
A merciful man,

1171
01:22:11,084 --> 01:22:17,484
Bonded to downtrodden…

1172
01:22:28,098 --> 01:22:29,379
"Donate blood.
Save life"

1173
01:22:30,058 --> 01:22:31,402
Oh! It's break dance.

1174
01:22:31,610 --> 01:22:33,410
Dub mash!
Flash mob!

1175
01:22:37,741 --> 01:22:39,381
Get down soon,
Bazaar street.

1176
01:22:40,381 --> 01:22:41,261
Hurry up.

1177
01:22:42,700 --> 01:22:43,580
Do i have to mention
you in specific?

1178
01:22:45,744 --> 01:22:48,264
Courtallam...Tenkasi...
Get in...

1179
01:23:01,220 --> 01:23:02,421
Go...go...
Start...

1180
01:23:16,025 --> 01:23:18,905
Why there is a space?
Draw leaves around MLA's photo.

1181
01:23:19,730 --> 01:23:23,129
Leaves will notify change of the party.
Then comes a parcel from Chennai.

1182
01:23:24,332 --> 01:23:25,132
Sada uncle,

1183
01:23:26,074 --> 01:23:27,553
am I such a worst photographer?

1184
01:23:28,904 --> 01:23:30,144
Okay, try something with effects.

1185
01:23:30,339 --> 01:23:31,739
When election comes, they will do that.

1186
01:23:33,371 --> 01:23:34,851
She wouldn't have told me.

1187
01:23:36,152 --> 01:23:38,355
If we don't design
some stuff on our own,

1188
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:40,340
They will say as
we haven't worked in it.

1189
01:23:40,472 --> 01:23:42,900
Do they work after elections?

1190
01:23:42,900 --> 01:23:43,621
Oh!

1191
01:23:45,236 --> 01:23:45,756
It's enough.

1192
01:23:50,858 --> 01:23:51,858
Okay, I will leave.

1193
01:23:52,499 --> 01:23:54,980
Don't talk gibberish
do something

1194
01:23:55,425 --> 01:23:56,306
I will do.

1195
01:23:56,380 --> 01:23:57,460
Dad, we will leave.

1196
01:24:00,290 --> 01:24:00,683
Dad...

1197
01:24:03,704 --> 01:24:06,143
Dad...
Selvam, is he missing again?

1198
01:24:31,100 --> 01:24:31,741
Nice...

1199
01:24:56,461 --> 01:24:57,621
What were you doing in
plantain grove?

1200
01:24:58,652 --> 01:25:00,252
-"went to see whether
it goes around!"

1201
01:25:25,163 --> 01:25:25,962
What are you doing?

1202
01:25:27,396 --> 01:25:33,036
A mild touch up and adding color
will make it still beauteous!

1203
01:25:33,138 --> 01:25:35,099
Will cut off your hand,
if you dare to touch it. Keep it there.

1204
01:25:57,762 --> 01:25:59,341
For a right moment,

1205
01:25:59,645 --> 01:26:02,645
Just before a second,
We ought to realize it.

1206
01:26:03,192 --> 01:26:05,741
Be ready to take the photograph.
We must wait for that moment.

1207
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:07,021
That means?

1208
01:26:09,461 --> 01:26:12,980
can only spoon feed.
You must chew it.

1209
01:26:14,164 --> 01:26:14,883
Selvam,

1210
01:26:15,522 --> 01:26:17,442
Nuances of Photography is
not something which can be taught.

1211
01:26:17,884 --> 01:26:18,684
But we can learn on our own.

1212
01:26:19,861 --> 01:26:22,540
"Learn to admire the light
and shadow together. "

1213
01:26:23,300 --> 01:26:28,020
"Everything around us
is adorned by beauty."

1214
01:26:28,756 --> 01:26:32,436
"Human beings, nature,
all treasures of beauty."

1215
01:26:33,301 --> 01:26:36,901
"To know and realize the beauty,

1216
01:26:37,543 --> 01:26:40,940
We must have creative spell
in our eyes"

1217
01:27:33,053 --> 01:27:33,453
There...

1218
01:27:38,300 --> 01:27:39,620
Ok... bye.
Bye,

1219
01:27:39,620 --> 01:27:40,621
See you later.

1220
01:29:09,108 --> 01:29:10,661
Sir, Welcome sir.
Have to send it.

1221
01:29:10,661 --> 01:29:11,701
Is it by speed post?
Yes.

1222
01:29:11,701 --> 01:29:12,860
How much?
50 bucks.

1223
01:29:13,787 --> 01:29:14,027
Take it.

1224
01:29:50,562 --> 01:29:51,780
Hey, did you notice?
Hmm.

1225
01:29:51,805 --> 01:29:54,965
A smart guy from "National studio"
stares at me for past two days.

1226
01:29:54,990 --> 01:29:58,071
Mud pot...
Are you blind?

1227
01:29:58,621 --> 01:30:01,180
Can't you guess where he looks at?
He stares at me.

1228
01:30:01,738 --> 01:30:03,058
fool!
Hmm.

1229
01:30:06,144 --> 01:30:08,583
I am going in,
park the vehicle and come soon.

1230
01:30:26,011 --> 01:30:28,211
Where are you going?
Come here.

1231
01:30:29,517 --> 01:30:32,116
Pooja will start now.
Come soon.

1232
01:31:02,860 --> 01:31:03,579
Hello...

1233
01:31:06,380 --> 01:31:07,580
Is there anyone in  house?

1234
01:31:17,416 --> 01:31:20,096
Hello...
Hello...

1235
01:31:27,124 --> 01:31:28,243
Hey
Hey

1236
01:31:31,236 --> 01:31:32,276
What did you do?

1237
01:31:32,531 --> 01:31:33,331
What happened?

1238
01:31:34,563 --> 01:31:35,163
Let me see.

1239
01:31:36,346 --> 01:31:36,907
Let me see.

1240
01:31:39,373 --> 01:31:41,132
Are you hopping
just for a petty prick by bristle?

1241
01:31:42,347 --> 01:31:42,907
Wait...

1242
01:32:14,154 --> 01:32:18,874
Isn't it a fudge,to take my photo
without my permission?

1243
01:32:19,420 --> 01:32:21,580
Hmm...
Let it be,

1244
01:32:21,580 --> 01:32:23,461
It's for a good purpose.

1245
01:32:24,463 --> 01:32:29,424
I came to take photo for
"Aval vikatan"magazine.

1246
01:32:30,341 --> 01:32:31,141
But?

1247
01:32:31,609 --> 01:32:35,528
You sent it to another magazine,
"Mangai."

1248
01:32:40,646 --> 01:32:41,405
Whatever it is,

1249
01:32:42,065 --> 01:32:43,305
The photo has come in
cover page of magazine.

1250
01:32:44,023 --> 01:32:45,756
I'm telling,not
just because it's my photo.

1251
01:32:46,015 --> 01:32:48,095
It's astonishing!

1252
01:32:49,843 --> 01:32:50,202
Thanks.

1253
01:32:51,622 --> 01:32:54,382
I was disappointed when you criticized
me on that day in studio.

1254
01:32:55,247 --> 01:32:57,687
People with us doesn't convey
our faults.

1255
01:32:58,440 --> 01:33:00,679
Only strangers tell us the fact.

1256
01:33:02,353 --> 01:33:03,392
You are Superb!

1257
01:33:34,048 --> 01:33:34,727
Hmm...

1258
01:33:39,900 --> 01:33:40,860
It's my photography!

1259
01:34:24,740 --> 01:34:25,861
Come up...

1260
01:34:25,861 --> 01:34:27,181
Get in... Get in...

1261
01:34:29,381 --> 01:34:30,581
Hurry up...

1262
01:34:42,711 --> 01:34:43,391
Get in... Get in...

1263
01:34:46,633 --> 01:34:48,433
Hi...
Hi...

1264
01:34:50,233 --> 01:34:51,461
seat not available.

1265
01:34:51,461 --> 01:34:51,901
Come up...

1266
01:34:51,901 --> 01:34:52,460
Get in... Get in...

1267
01:34:55,381 --> 01:34:55,940
Start...

1268
01:35:27,983 --> 01:35:30,101
Vidhya,
everything is out of control now.

1269
01:35:30,507 --> 01:35:31,021
Oh!

1270
01:35:31,249 --> 01:35:34,749
That girl came to house
and took the bristle.

1271
01:35:34,995 --> 01:35:35,676
Is it?

1272
01:35:35,701 --> 01:35:36,460
Selvam told me.

1273
01:35:37,261 --> 01:35:38,100
Oh okay!

1274
01:35:38,100 --> 01:35:39,581
How about that girl?
Is she fraudulent?

1275
01:35:39,661 --> 01:35:40,300
No...No...

1276
01:35:40,821 --> 01:35:43,060
She won't cheat, right?
-Definitely she won't cheat.

1277
01:35:43,421 --> 01:35:45,661
Because the same wound may
get hurt again.

1278
01:35:45,848 --> 01:35:46,847
Already he suffered.

1279
01:35:47,060 --> 01:35:47,821
He is good.

1280
01:35:48,260 --> 01:35:49,540
But can't believe these girls.

1281
01:35:50,141 --> 01:35:51,421
Who told you not to believe?

1282
01:35:51,421 --> 01:35:53,581
Hey, It's not about you.
I said about girls.

1283
01:35:53,861 --> 01:35:55,741
Oh okay!

1284
01:35:59,101 --> 01:36:00,500
I told you to wait down.

1285
01:36:00,898 --> 01:36:02,258
Take it.
Go.

1286
01:36:03,640 --> 01:36:04,159
Hey,

1287
01:36:04,726 --> 01:36:06,500
I told you to get
the print from thenkasi, got it?

1288
01:36:06,860 --> 01:36:08,261
You told me to get tablet
from medical shop.

1289
01:36:08,261 --> 01:36:09,100
Where is the tablet then?

1290
01:36:09,210 --> 01:36:10,621
Before buying tablet,
you told me to go to tenkasi.

1291
01:36:10,773 --> 01:36:11,640
Then where is the print?

1292
01:36:11,804 --> 01:36:12,580
How to get the print
in medical shop?

1293
01:36:12,580 --> 01:36:13,515
Then where is the tablet?

1294
01:36:13,671 --> 01:36:14,676
How to get the tablet
in press?

1295
01:36:14,780 --> 01:36:16,460
Did you went to press
or medical shop?

1296
01:36:16,460 --> 01:36:17,217
Must go hereafter.

1297
01:36:17,242 --> 01:36:18,762
Finally,
you didn't do any work, right?

1298
01:36:18,796 --> 01:36:21,061
Chit chat with the girls.

1299
01:36:21,249 --> 01:36:22,195
Don't confuse me.

1300
01:36:22,452 --> 01:36:23,420
Whether I must go to tenkasi
or medical shop?

1301
01:36:23,420 --> 01:36:24,740
Go wherever you wish,
tramp!

1302
01:36:25,700 --> 01:36:27,541
Where are you going?

1303
01:36:27,718 --> 01:36:28,621
You told me to go.

1304
01:36:28,621 --> 01:36:31,621
Don't go immediately.
Get in and do the work. Go...

1305
01:36:31,651 --> 01:36:32,850
What work do I have?

1306
01:36:34,386 --> 01:36:36,186
Made a blunder!
By giving him a job.

1307
01:37:08,471 --> 01:37:09,272
What happened?

1308
01:37:09,701 --> 01:37:11,021
Earlier it was wrong.

1309
01:37:12,260 --> 01:37:13,501
You understood it only now?

1310
01:37:16,540 --> 01:37:18,220
Is it right?
Hmm...

1311
01:37:18,917 --> 01:37:19,757
Okay.

1312
01:37:24,901 --> 01:37:25,340
Hello...

1313
01:37:25,749 --> 01:37:27,661
Hello, National Selvam!
I am Malar.

1314
01:37:27,848 --> 01:37:29,528
Hi Malar, how are you?

1315
01:37:31,700 --> 01:37:34,501
I think we both are in love.

1316
01:37:36,180 --> 01:37:39,421
Before that I wish to clarify
a couple of things.

1317
01:37:40,661 --> 01:37:41,300
First,

1318
01:37:41,862 --> 01:37:44,183
Hi,
Hi...

1319
01:37:47,921 --> 01:37:49,521
Vidhya told me about Valli.

1320
01:37:50,273 --> 01:37:51,832
I know her very well.

1321
01:37:52,220 --> 01:37:59,300
In school days, she collected
the relief fund and had masala dosa.

1322
01:37:59,386 --> 01:37:59,986
Leave it.

1323
01:38:00,457 --> 01:38:01,498
That doesn't sound good now.
Why must we gush about her?

1324
01:38:01,749 --> 01:38:02,995
In either way she is not
the right match to you.

1325
01:38:03,324 --> 01:38:05,844
It's your goodness,
she left you.

1326
01:38:08,339 --> 01:38:10,620
Hello...
-Yeah! Hello...

1327
01:38:11,394 --> 01:38:12,393
The second thing,

1328
01:38:13,441 --> 01:38:18,023
I am the younger sister of Vellaiyappan,
whom you are waiting to take avenge.

1329
01:38:26,265 --> 01:38:27,901
Love,
only if you are brave enough!

1330
01:38:28,221 --> 01:38:29,741
Ponder well and take a good decision.

1331
01:38:30,366 --> 01:38:33,661
Tomorrow at dawn,in "Aiyyanar temple"
which is on the way to tenkasi,

1332
01:38:34,530 --> 01:38:38,941
I will be waiting on the huge rock there.

1333
01:38:39,459 --> 01:38:41,778
If you wish, come there.
If not, leave it.

1334
01:38:52,174 --> 01:38:52,895
Hey,

1335
01:38:53,105 --> 01:38:54,585
he fractured hand just for
asking her name.

1336
01:38:54,860 --> 01:38:55,981
You dare to love her!

1337
01:38:58,587 --> 01:38:59,706
On the whole,
a ruckus is confirmed.

1338
01:38:59,980 --> 01:39:02,620
Decide whether it's only for waders
or to that girl too.

1339
01:39:06,084 --> 01:39:07,964
Hey, wait.
I will also come with you.

1340
01:40:40,741 --> 01:40:44,141
"Drizzles in my heart,
Drizzles in my heart"

1341
01:40:44,296 --> 01:40:47,900
"The celestial sphere jitters"

1342
01:40:48,301 --> 01:40:51,740
"Doting lotus, doting lotus,"

1343
01:40:51,861 --> 01:40:54,781
"Comes everywhere to cherish"

1344
01:40:55,100 --> 01:40:57,301
"How many hey days,
how many hey days,

1345
01:40:57,380 --> 01:40:58,621
hitherto to heed"

1346
01:40:58,940 --> 01:41:02,300
"Standing at a horizon,
standing at a horizon,  and hanker for!"

1347
01:41:02,860 --> 01:41:05,941
"A melody runs in my mind
in intonation voice,"

1348
01:41:06,255 --> 01:41:10,575
"Cage the eyes and bursts
into a song in the ears."

1349
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:14,120
"Drizzles in my heart,
Drizzles in my heart"

1350
01:41:14,550 --> 01:41:17,630
"The celestial sphere jitters"

1351
01:41:18,541 --> 01:41:21,901
"Doting lotus, doting lotus,"

1352
01:41:22,060 --> 01:41:24,940
"Comes everywhere to cherish"

1353
01:41:32,500 --> 01:41:33,380
Sir,
-Yes.

1354
01:41:33,541 --> 01:41:35,380
Malar's dad met with an accident.
Must get her now.

1355
01:41:37,060 --> 01:41:38,221
Malar, you can go.

1356
01:41:42,301 --> 01:41:44,860
Hey, do you lie as
my dad is serious?

1357
01:41:44,891 --> 01:41:46,811
When I told lie?
He has gone long before.

1358
01:41:53,968 --> 01:41:57,181
"How many hey days
to hitherto in a pace?"

1359
01:41:57,797 --> 01:42:00,876
"Crave to see you constantly"

1360
01:42:01,541 --> 01:42:04,621
"The haste days which passed
in your absence,"

1361
01:42:05,325 --> 01:42:07,925
"Makes me to brawl,"

1362
01:42:08,218 --> 01:42:10,156
"To say the fact,
you filled my days with colors,"

1363
01:42:10,249 --> 01:42:11,913
Madhava, come.
I will drop you.

1364
01:42:11,938 --> 01:42:13,663
I will go by bus.
Come maddy,

1365
01:42:13,749 --> 01:42:15,101
Come with me.
Why do you go by bus?

1366
01:42:15,101 --> 01:42:16,301
Is it?
Come...

1367
01:42:16,301 --> 01:42:19,700
"On my boundless glaze,
You drop in as slender fish,"

1368
01:42:20,111 --> 01:42:22,271
"How many hey days,
how many hey days,

1369
01:42:22,296 --> 01:42:23,497
hitherto to heed"

1370
01:42:23,912 --> 01:42:27,071
"Standing at a horizon,
standing at a horizon,  and hanker for!"

1371
01:42:27,701 --> 01:42:30,980
"A melody runs in my mind
in intonation voice,"

1372
01:42:31,021 --> 01:42:35,740
"Cage the eyes and bursts
into a song in the ears."

1373
01:42:35,941 --> 01:42:39,301
"Drizzles in my heart,
Drizzles in my heart"

1374
01:42:39,500 --> 01:42:42,700
"The celestial sphere jitters"

1375
01:43:17,020 --> 01:43:20,261
"It's enough of your pantomime,"

1376
01:43:20,820 --> 01:43:23,821
"My eyes wander in
search of your love"

1377
01:43:24,541 --> 01:43:27,980
"Literally in need of
a couple of garlands,

1378
01:43:28,420 --> 01:43:31,420
Desire to exchange
without any query"

1379
01:43:31,420 --> 01:43:33,781
"Where there is no women
in my home,"

1380
01:43:33,781 --> 01:43:36,740
"You must come as a blessing with
your foot impression,"

1381
01:43:37,100 --> 01:43:39,421
"As good as breeze in my garden,

1382
01:43:39,421 --> 01:43:42,461
The wind flows again
because of you..."

1383
01:43:43,220 --> 01:43:45,221
"How many hey days,
how many hey days,

1384
01:43:45,421 --> 01:43:46,501
hitherto to heed"

1385
01:43:46,990 --> 01:43:50,310
"Standing at a horizon,
standing at a horizon,  and hanker for!"

1386
01:43:50,797 --> 01:43:53,998
"A melody runs in my mind
in intonation voice,"

1387
01:43:54,301 --> 01:43:58,741
"Cage the eyes and bursts
into a song in the ears."

1388
01:43:59,101 --> 01:44:02,420
"Drizzles in my heart,
Drizzles in my heart"

1389
01:44:02,581 --> 01:44:06,140
"The celestial sphere jitters"

1390
01:44:06,581 --> 01:44:09,901
"Doting lotus, doting lotus,"

1391
01:44:10,181 --> 01:44:13,340
"Comes everywhere to cherish"

1392
01:44:13,461 --> 01:44:15,500
"How many hey days,
how many hey days,

1393
01:44:15,620 --> 01:44:16,940
hitherto to heed"

1394
01:44:17,206 --> 01:44:20,526
"Standing at a horizon,
standing at a horizon,  and hanker for!"

1395
01:44:21,061 --> 01:44:24,340
"A melody runs in my mind
in intonation voice,"

1396
01:44:24,541 --> 01:44:28,821
"Cage the eyes and bursts
into a song in the ears."

1397
01:45:09,924 --> 01:45:12,444
Went to bus stand to see him.

1398
01:45:12,444 --> 01:45:19,715
Mocked him in mid brain.
Spot dead!

1399
01:45:19,740 --> 01:45:20,980
Is it?

1400
01:45:25,244 --> 01:45:26,284
Hello..

1401
01:45:26,284 --> 01:45:29,840
Friend, Vellaiyappan's associates
are standing in the road.

1402
01:45:29,865 --> 01:45:31,865
If you come soon,
Will hit them and put on waders.

1403
01:45:33,926 --> 01:45:37,775
Hey, aren't you ashamed?
Let him come.

1404
01:45:53,884 --> 01:45:56,604
Hey... Hey...
Stop… Stop…

1405
01:45:56,660 --> 01:45:57,939
Who?
Who?

1406
01:45:58,058 --> 01:45:59,418
Why?
Why?

1407
01:45:59,443 --> 01:46:00,786
What?
What?

1408
01:46:00,811 --> 01:46:03,011
Hey stop there.
Tell me who are you?

1409
01:46:03,372 --> 01:46:04,892
Give me your phone number.

1410
01:46:06,437 --> 01:46:09,157
Look at the way he fights
like Jackie chan!

1411
01:46:09,957 --> 01:46:11,116
Sada uncle,
Sada uncle,

1412
01:46:11,476 --> 01:46:14,411
Friends of vellaiyappan was hit hard by
someone on the road.

1413
01:46:14,509 --> 01:46:16,228
God is there!
God is there!

1414
01:46:18,102 --> 01:46:20,782
No...
God is no where.

1415
01:46:21,463 --> 01:46:24,943
Or else, will I give job to an
unloyal person who don't deserve it?

1416
01:46:25,600 --> 01:46:26,809
Uncle, why are you
so harsh on me?

1417
01:46:27,109 --> 01:46:28,829
Who is your uncle?
Am I your uncle?

1418
01:46:29,025 --> 01:46:30,504
Is your mother a sibling to me?

1419
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:32,479
Will knuckle you down.
Get up.

1420
01:46:34,135 --> 01:46:35,255
What's going on between
you and Vidhya?

1421
01:46:35,519 --> 01:46:36,153
Dengolphy?

1422
01:46:36,680 --> 01:46:38,480
If I see you again hanging
around with her,

1423
01:46:38,505 --> 01:46:39,465
Will crush your bones.

1424
01:46:39,647 --> 01:46:40,153
Enough! Enough!

1425
01:46:41,151 --> 01:46:42,352
Did you ask Vidhya about this?

1426
01:46:43,274 --> 01:46:45,554
Don't ask.
She will spit on you.

1427
01:46:51,577 --> 01:46:54,817
What's that?
Dengolphy?

1428
01:46:55,846 --> 01:46:57,165
Dengolphy?
Is it?

1429
01:47:02,729 --> 01:47:04,328
Is this the way a father talks?

1430
01:47:06,558 --> 01:47:08,757
Is it a unitary meaning,
if a girl and boy bonds?

1431
01:47:10,160 --> 01:47:12,039
Everything seems to be yellow,
if you wear yellow glasses.

1432
01:47:16,157 --> 01:47:17,317
I may not be good,

1433
01:47:17,888 --> 01:47:20,408
But Vidhya?
She is a golden flower.

1434
01:47:21,951 --> 01:47:23,511
Is this the trust
you have on your daughter?

1435
01:47:27,956 --> 01:47:29,116
I had plenty of respect on you.

1436
01:47:29,790 --> 01:47:31,391
You scattered all
just by a word!

1437
01:47:33,463 --> 01:47:35,303
Dengolphy?
No...

1438
01:47:36,415 --> 01:47:37,775
With humiliation in mind,

1439
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:39,601
You don't get peace by
framing photos of God.

1440
01:47:39,788 --> 01:47:40,547
Hey...

1441
01:47:43,214 --> 01:47:44,174
Come here.

1442
01:47:48,519 --> 01:47:51,078
Sit.
Sit.

1443
01:47:55,943 --> 01:47:57,504
I am mindless!

1444
01:48:00,758 --> 01:48:02,157
Don't provoke me to cry.

1445
01:48:09,633 --> 01:48:12,072
Will you go to any extreme
for the sake of money?

1446
01:48:16,515 --> 01:48:18,756
Get lost with your
passport and visa.

1447
01:48:18,781 --> 01:48:21,261
You must see dubai
only in map in the future.

1448
01:48:23,795 --> 01:48:24,596
Hello...

1449
01:48:25,137 --> 01:48:26,337
Brother,
What?

1450
01:48:27,292 --> 01:48:29,092
Brother,
our grandmother passed away.

1451
01:48:29,629 --> 01:48:30,869
I know you won't get leave.

1452
01:48:31,713 --> 01:48:33,114
Must inform you.

1453
01:48:33,364 --> 01:48:35,404
All our relatives has come.

1454
01:48:35,404 --> 01:48:37,683
We will take care.
Okay.

1455
01:48:38,098 --> 01:48:40,178
Do you have the receipt
of the cash paid?

1456
01:49:06,203 --> 01:49:07,364
Okay.
Yes.

1457
01:49:34,135 --> 01:49:35,135
Brother has come.

1458
01:49:36,223 --> 01:49:37,623
Not because of
grandmother's death.

1459
01:49:39,124 --> 01:49:40,523
He bang the supervisor there.

1460
01:49:41,656 --> 01:49:42,575
so sent him out of job.

1461
01:49:46,839 --> 01:49:47,398
Are you scared?

1462
01:49:49,894 --> 01:49:51,054
I learnt "Kung Fu!"

1463
01:49:51,550 --> 01:49:51,830
What?

1464
01:49:52,351 --> 01:49:53,551
The drama which goes
on in terrace,

1465
01:49:54,038 --> 01:49:55,039
Isn't it a comedy?

1466
01:49:56,295 --> 01:49:57,455
You are talking not
knowing the situation.

1467
01:50:00,558 --> 01:50:01,879
You don't know about him.

1468
01:50:02,839 --> 01:50:03,998
You are going to get
thrashed in his hands.

1469
01:50:07,992 --> 01:50:09,992
Okay...
If you are adamant to hit him,

1470
01:50:10,255 --> 01:50:15,415
After our marriage,talk to him
formally and blow him.

1471
01:50:19,063 --> 01:50:20,023
I plead you,

1472
01:50:20,503 --> 01:50:21,782
Don't mess up.
Please.

1473
01:50:24,799 --> 01:50:25,317
Be good...

1474
01:50:31,278 --> 01:50:32,959
Either you should get marry
or get hit by brother,

1475
01:50:33,382 --> 01:50:34,823
decide on your own!

1476
01:51:30,170 --> 01:51:31,051
Yes selvam!

1477
01:51:31,886 --> 01:51:32,805
I am going to hit him.

1478
01:51:34,021 --> 01:51:36,861
I don't expect anyone else
other than your presence.

1479
01:52:36,382 --> 01:52:41,663
Bro,
he was drunk and beyond control.

1480
01:52:41,789 --> 01:52:42,749
Vellaiyappa...

1481
01:52:47,566 --> 01:52:51,167
Do you recognise me?
I am "National Selvam"

1482
01:52:51,781 --> 01:52:53,822
It was me whom you pounced
in the bazaar street.

1483
01:52:56,623 --> 01:52:59,342
I took a vow that I won't put on waders
until I avenge on you.

1484
01:53:07,118 --> 01:53:07,918
Are you well and good?

1485
01:53:11,535 --> 01:53:11,895
Hmm...

1486
01:53:16,421 --> 01:53:17,062
Shall we start?

1487
01:53:48,324 --> 01:53:49,365
Hit...

1488
01:53:51,481 --> 01:53:52,002
Hit...

1489
01:54:01,755 --> 01:54:02,275
Hit...

1490
01:54:03,030 --> 01:54:03,550

1491
01:54:04,364 --> 01:54:04,883

1492
01:54:05,452 --> 01:54:05,974
Hit...

1493
01:54:51,661 --> 01:54:52,182
Kill him...

1494
01:55:27,884 --> 01:55:30,524
Take your hand...

1495
01:55:33,303 --> 01:55:33,824
Hit brother...

1496
01:55:34,244 --> 01:55:34,764

1497
01:55:57,280 --> 01:55:57,800
Hit...

1498
01:55:57,964 --> 01:55:58,484
Hit...

1499
01:57:08,667 --> 01:57:15,987
Selvam!

1500
01:57:30,603 --> 01:57:31,443
Hey...

1501
01:57:37,721 --> 01:57:38,562
Leave me...

1502
01:57:39,044 --> 01:57:41,764
Selvam!

1503
01:57:41,789 --> 01:57:42,629
Leave me...

1504
01:57:42,963 --> 01:57:46,724

1505
01:57:56,163 --> 01:57:59,925
Selvam!

1506
01:58:19,380 --> 01:58:22,861
Give me size 8 paragon!
Really?

1507
01:59:09,527 --> 01:59:10,566
I too have the pain.

1508
01:59:11,738 --> 01:59:13,938
Missed a bit in the last.

1509
01:59:14,841 --> 01:59:15,960
Else,I wouldn't have left you.

1510
01:59:17,968 --> 01:59:18,928
I am not a ruffian.

1511
01:59:20,654 --> 01:59:22,414
My situation made me to do so.

1512
01:59:25,957 --> 01:59:27,237
Was he the one who hit you?

1513
01:59:29,719 --> 01:59:30,959
I like Malar.

1514
01:59:32,006 --> 01:59:32,765
She too...

1515
01:59:35,918 --> 01:59:37,239
We wish to get marry.

1516
01:59:39,886 --> 01:59:40,647
Best!

1517
01:59:43,238 --> 01:59:43,998
What's your opinion?

1518
01:59:53,516 --> 01:59:54,555
I will be back.
Okay.

1519
02:00:20,160 --> 02:00:22,700
What sin I did?

1520
02:00:25,727 --> 02:00:28,007
I became spineless,
doing household chores.

1521
02:00:31,351 --> 02:00:33,952
You bolted out!
left her on my head. Bully!

1522
02:00:34,708 --> 02:00:35,187
Culprit.

1523
02:00:37,807 --> 02:00:40,367
Hey, what's going on there?
-I am coming.
