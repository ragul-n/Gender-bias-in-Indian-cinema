1
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:32,885
We are identical twins...

2
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:40,322
but we are poles apart.

3
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:46,005
He lags behind
where as l, zoom ahead.

4
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:55,043
He stammers and...
I pronounce S as F.

5
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:02,714
On his death bed, my father said...
Charlie, always remember...

6
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:05,314
Iife is a bitch!

7
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:09,327
And the only way to deal with life,
is to be...

8
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:13,329
(Scoundrels)

9
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:26,105
The path we choose doesn't
screw our life...

10
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:30,476
what screws us is...
the path we leave behind!

11
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:45,424
There are two ways to
earn a quick buck!

12
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:49,992
A shortcut...
and a shorter shortcut!

13
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:02,937
Get him!

14
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:10,446
I took the shortcut...
yet my dreams got screwed.

15
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:12,382
Big time!

16
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:21,891
Blue thunder.

17
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:54,259
My dreams..

18
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:58,859
My sweet little dreams.

19
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:37,408
My life...
my whole wide world...

20
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:39,901
My booking window.

21
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:48,080
In reality...
I'm just a small time gangster.

22
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,281
Our gang fixes derbies.

23
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,763
Come on! Come on!

24
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:06,727
People bet money on the
favorite horses that win..

25
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,467
..but we bet on losing.

26
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:11,469
Blue thunder was
favorite in yesterday's derby.

27
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,445
This race was fixed.

28
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:16,715
I had bet my life time earning,
rupees hundred thousand..

29
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:18,910
..on that horse.

30
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:26,048
But the jockey double crossed us.

31
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:29,855
I had to pay a heavy
price for this shortcut.

32
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:36,960
Our booking company lots
its reputation and hazard.

33
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,499
The company is run by
three Bengali brothers.

34
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:43,401
This is Mujeeb and that's Shumon.

35
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,392
Mikhail, the third Bengali brother.

36
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:12,928
- How're you?
- The same as you!

37
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:17,133
My buddy, dearer
than my own brother.

38
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:19,769
A kid at heart but...

39
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:22,041
a maniac in the head.

40
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:27,052
Indian National Small Arms System.

41
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:29,379
In short lNSAS.

42
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:31,917
The heroine of the Kargil war...

43
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:33,383
purely homebred.

44
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,724
A distant cousin of the AK47.

45
00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:38,863
Weight: 6.37 kgs.

46
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:41,095
Range: 700 meters.

47
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:45,030
Feed: 30 round
- plastic box magazine.

48
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:47,239
How many can it kill in one round?

49
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:50,168
Sir, you'll lose count, but
the bullets will carry on.

50
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:55,774
- Some people change with time...

51
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:59,273
and how the times change for some.

52
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:03,413
Arsehole...

53
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:07,016
money can be quite the devil.

54
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:14,193
You had to pull the reins here.

55
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:19,870
Double cross Burgess!

56
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:24,366
Double cross!

57
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:27,741
- Shumon! - Yes...

58
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:30,113
The viewfinder is screwed.

59
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:34,042
Bro says the viewfinder is off mark.

60
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:35,445
Not possible, sir.

61
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:37,780
Big brother never lies!

62
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:45,930
Please don't do this.

63
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:47,090
Do what?

64
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:51,096
You screw us all over...

65
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:53,435
that's cool, huh?

66
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:57,766
The sky disappeared and...

67
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:58,902
my balls vanished from my boxers!

68
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:03,411
- You know how much we lost?

69
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:08,153
Charlie, they will kill me.

70
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:09,888
And we will worship you!

71
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,689
Stop crying, you rascal!

72
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:16,695
Brother says if he
aims at Burgess' head...

73
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:20,061
the bullet will hit
the clock instead.

74
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:23,930
- Not the clock... the lamp.

75
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:27,399
The lamp!

76
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:30,941
- Please forgive me!

77
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:33,777
I'm the one who is screwed here.

78
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:35,377
Royally screwed!

79
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:40,182
If I start crying,
you'll drown in my tears.

80
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:45,054
I want his name!!

81
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:51,054
Francis!

82
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:56,763
Franfif?

83
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,237
You're growing senile day by day.

84
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:14,011
You've absolutely lost it!

85
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:15,144
What if I were shot?

86
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:17,355
My cute little darling...

87
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:20,890
Stop flashing your pearlies!

88
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,825
He almost crapped in his pants!

89
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,227
Even you would've crapped!

90
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:27,061
Such a coward!

91
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:30,125
You really thought
he would shoot you?

92
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,734
You are shit scared!

93
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:34,397
What did you say?

94
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:36,265
Growing senile day by day?

95
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:41,042
You're absolutely right!

96
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:46,912
All three are nuts!

97
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,911
Every brother
in the world is crazy.

98
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:52,015
Just like mine!

99
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:58,724
Here comes the Love Bee

100
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:15,471
Whiplash him, Fatak!!

101
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:22,753
Here comes the Love Bee

102
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:25,751
Whiplash him, Fatak!!

103
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:32,762
Here he comes- humming

104
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:35,996
Whiplash him, Fatak!!

105
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,861
Here comes the Love Bee-

106
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:40,872
Here he comes- humming

107
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,931
Bumbling through the lanes

108
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:48,811
Hasn't found anyone
worth desiring, no, not yet

109
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:51,975
Whiplash him, Fatak!!

110
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:55,451
He deals off his friends

111
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:57,512
Look at the dandy,
the way he struts

112
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:01,392
He deals off his friends

113
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,122
Look at the dandy,
the way he struts

114
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:07,757
Full of swagger and all

115
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:13,171
Whiplash him, Fatak!!

116
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:14,897
Hurl him on the ground

117
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:18,010
Dare you count on him as a friend

118
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:22,004
The rogue aimlessly
tramps the streets

119
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,950
Dare you count on him as a friend

120
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:30,279
The rogue aimlessly
tramps the streets

121
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:34,357
This leech will always feed on you

122
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:38,161
He may go but will return soon

123
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:42,998
In every defiled droplet of blood

124
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:44,934
To nibble your life away

125
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:47,396
Look, look he returns

126
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:52,209
He returns this
illicit child of the night

127
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:56,772
Whiplash him, Fatak!!

128
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:59,784
Here comes the Love Bee-

129
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:01,717
Here he comes- humming

130
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:03,721
Here comes the Love Bee-

131
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:05,381
Here he comes- humming

132
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,323
Here comes the Love Bee-

133
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,452
Here he comes- humming

134
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,856
Bumbling through the lanes

135
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:13,796
Hasn't found anyone
worth desiring, no, not yet

136
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:15,834
Here comes the Love Bee-

137
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:17,764
Here he comes- humming

138
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:27,070
This love is not easy

139
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:32,744
The fear of AlDS hovers around

140
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:40,081
Wear your oars

141
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:48,459
This river is made of fire

142
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:51,994
Be careful, lest your boat capsizes

143
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:53,936
Be careful, lest the Love Bee stings

144
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:55,997
Be careful, lest your boat capsizes

145
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:58,009
Be careful, lest the Love Bee stings

146
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:00,334
Jeetu, where's Guddu?

147
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:04,373
Where's Guddu?

148
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,713
Guddu!

149
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:07,844
We need to talk...

150
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,346
Listen!

151
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:11,781
Guddu listen to me...

152
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:13,449
The boat capsized...

153
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:18,254
Capsized!

154
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:30,770
- Let's do another test?

155
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,404
This was the third.

156
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:44,348
When did you go for the other two?

157
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:50,228
Why didn't you tell me?

158
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:52,287
- I didn't want to
stress you out... - And now?

159
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:07,243
Now where's your s... s...

160
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:10,379
Sincerity?

161
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:17,780
Safety?

162
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,450
- What is it? - Science!

163
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:23,456
Home science? Huh?

164
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:32,767
It was right here...

165
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:34,496
Kama Sutra condoms, a full packet.

166
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:35,831
Forget about it.

167
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,773
I'm a topper in home science.

168
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,777
- Home science?

169
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:45,174
What do you mean?

170
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:53,950
I mean...

171
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:55,960
there's no danger today.

172
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:06,462
I don't like anything between us.

173
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,266
Nothing!

174
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:12,268
Glad the damn thing is lost.

175
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:22,914
Let me take one last look...

176
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:26,725
- it's got to be here.
-You're such a dork.

177
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:27,850
- Let it be!

178
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,359
Do you know the distance
it creates between us?

179
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,504
you're in New... New...

180
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:45,801
New Jersey?

181
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:48,975
- New... - New Zealand?

182
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:50,806
New Delhi?

183
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:52,874
New... New...

184
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:56,949
New Bombay.

185
00:15:58,223 --> 00:16:01,818
Not Bombay... Mumbai.

186
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,022
You love Mumbai?

187
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:48,505
- Yes, doctor. I'll call you later.

188
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:56,472
He says it will be done in a day.

189
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,419
I can be back in four hours...

190
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,748
same day.

191
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:12,422
Fix an appointment for tomorrow?

192
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:19,794
- Please say something.
- Do as you like.

193
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,931
I won't be part of this murder.

194
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:24,066
What do you mean?

195
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,238
Oh my!

196
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:33,976
Got it!

197
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:36,847
My single piece.

198
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,456
We'll sail through!

199
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,025
I'm ready to be a mother...

200
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:48,896
But I'm not ready to
become a father!

201
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:54,495
Please understand, my dear!

202
00:17:56,175 --> 00:18:00,009
We don't have enough
to support each other.

203
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:02,339
How do we support a child?

204
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:05,081
Things will fall into place.

205
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,280
This is our destiny.

206
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:11,746
Our destiny is screwed. Big time!

207
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:16,422
I can't get married right now.
Period!

208
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:21,457
Why not?

209
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:27,263
All yours.

210
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:33,176
My life... my plan... my future...

211
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:43,450
Marriage in 2014...

212
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:45,451
and honeymoon in 2009!

213
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:47,184
Bravo Mr Sharma. Bravo!

214
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:50,853
You wanted it!

215
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:54,762
And you didn't?

216
00:18:57,035 --> 00:18:58,093
No!

217
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,109
So I must have raped you then!?

218
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,219
And all those promises...

219
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:25,422
was it the booze?

220
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:30,464
"Baby! It feels as though
I've known you for ages."

221
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:36,139
Please, listen...

222
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:39,369
I'll take up a job.

223
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:47,113
But I still can't
marry you now. I mean...

224
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,118
" I mean... I
mean..." What do you mean?

225
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:54,851
You don't want an
abortion nor want to marry.

226
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,186
What do you want?

227
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,499
I just want to die.

228
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,900
Fine! Go die!

229
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:12,403
Please Guddu... please...

230
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,373
I can't see you die.

231
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:18,073
- I am not committing suicide.

232
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:21,877
I know but if we
don't get married soon...

233
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,954
you'll be killed for sure.

234
00:20:25,757 --> 00:20:28,089
- Listen... my full name is...

235
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:30,953
- Sweety Shekhar Bhope.

236
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:36,990
I'm Sunil "Chopper" Bhope's sister.

237
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,432
Guddu...

238
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:55,316
Bho... Bho...

239
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:57,112
pe!

240
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:13,896
Hail Maharashtra!

241
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,366
- We sent someone to check.

242
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:18,499
She hasn't been to
college for a month.

243
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:20,369
Uncle...

244
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:22,371
- Been bunking!

245
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:26,476
- Who's the boy?
- I want a chocolate!

246
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:28,947
- Some "Guddu".

247
00:21:30,822 --> 00:21:33,222
- Address? -Navi Mumbai

248
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,227
- Uncle, I want a chocolate...
- Shut up!

249
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:38,287
Miser!

250
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,801
- Get the cars out! - Chief,
listen to me...

251
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:47,464
We've got that
interview lined up for today.

252
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:51,235
It's taken us 15
years to clear our name.

253
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:57,847
Today is your interview.
Live on television.

254
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:01,719
Just relax and...

255
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:04,717
Iet me handle this.

256
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:06,782
Trust me on this one.

257
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:11,987
Look at that...

258
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:15,298
your blood sugar level
is down to 110.

259
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,493
We'll slice the boy and
serve him for dessert.

260
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:26,209
- Hail Maharashtra!

261
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:38,081
It's not my fault
that he is my brother!

262
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:57,434
The fault is that you lied to me.

263
00:23:00,946 --> 00:23:02,243
Why?

264
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:12,381
Don't you trust me?

265
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:21,824
Have some water.

266
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:24,233
Add some poison as well.

267
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:29,968
Then you will die.

268
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:33,171
At least I'll be out of your way.

269
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:37,078
That's the point!

270
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:45,422
I'm as good as dead without you!

271
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,159
Then we will float
around as ghosts!

272
00:23:51,897 --> 00:23:55,799
And your brother can't stop
ghosts from getting married.

273
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:00,732
There's a slight problem though.

274
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:05,136
Can ghosts have kids?

275
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:06,269
Idiot!

276
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:19,719
So... when do we take the plunge?

277
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:24,920
Today...

278
00:24:27,365 --> 00:24:28,423
now...

279
00:24:32,771 --> 00:24:35,831
Hello... hello...

280
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:39,903
Can you hear me?

281
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:41,973
Yes, go ahead.

282
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:46,280
Yes, it's fixed.

283
00:24:48,353 --> 00:24:50,412
Eight o'clock? Hold on...

284
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:52,180
Is eight o'clock fine?

285
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:56,158
- For what? - Our wedding...

286
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:58,486
- Eii... eight... - Yeah...
eight o'clock.

287
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:00,022
Today?

288
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:03,190
Nope... in 2014!

289
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:08,405
Yes... eight o'clock sounds good.

290
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:14,737
When days are dogs...
Life's a bitch!

291
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:18,375
Once there was some
integrity in this business...

292
00:25:19,117 --> 00:25:20,175
but not anymore!

293
00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:25,389
And now, my mind is
occupied with just one name...

294
00:25:26,324 --> 00:25:27,382
Franfif!

295
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:34,026
- I found Franfif...

296
00:25:35,767 --> 00:25:36,825
Awesome!

297
00:25:37,168 --> 00:25:38,294
He is staying right here.

298
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:41,771
Room 716.

299
00:25:44,776 --> 00:25:46,971
- He fixing a race right now!

300
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,471
Alright, I'll inform
big bro. Leave right now.

301
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,081
And when I say leave,
you better leave.

302
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,818
- Let's go.

303
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:04,353
- Come on...

304
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:09,063
- We leave this way.

305
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:16,397
But destiny lies that way.

306
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:47,829
Mr Narang?

307
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:23,071
Hey... hi...
how are you doing today?

308
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:26,469
You know actually, we've
just forgotten the keys inside.

309
00:27:27,846 --> 00:27:28,972
Do you have a master key on you?

310
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:37,113
Sir...

311
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:41,249
Please don't kill me.
I've got two little kids and...

312
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:43,988
I love my wife, Lobo Sir...

313
00:27:45,463 --> 00:27:48,227
Lele Sir... please don't kill me.

314
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:52,097
- From today I'm Tashi's pet...

315
00:28:10,922 --> 00:28:13,413
- Where are you?
- Where do you think?

316
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:16,689
Got the guitar?

317
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:28,932
Come over to the
Madh lsland bungalow.

318
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:32,767
Cool!

319
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:36,247
Afghanibhai, is Tashi around?

320
00:28:37,315 --> 00:28:38,373
- Why?

321
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,247
The airline guys are
offering a deal.

322
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,378
Hold on...

323
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:45,781
Tashi...

324
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:49,385
- the flight purser at the
hotel has something to say.

325
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:54,156
Go on...

326
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:21,221
Tashi, he wants to say that...

327
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:22,816
he is now your pet dog.

328
00:29:24,028 --> 00:29:25,689
But I like bitches!

329
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:29,465
I have far too many dogs.

330
00:29:30,068 --> 00:29:31,467
Shoo away... shoo...

331
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:35,806
What the hell!!

332
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:42,838
- Where are the Africans?
- In Goa.

333
00:29:44,382 --> 00:29:45,440
Call them.

334
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,716
Tell them the guitar
has been arranged for.

335
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:53,983
Tell them to get
my twins by tonight.

336
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:05,758
They will pick you up for
the racecourse tomorrow.

337
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:11,203
The Bengalis are sniffing
you down like rabid dogs.

338
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:18,875
Anything you need, will
be delivered to your room.

339
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:22,953
Don't move out!
- Sure.

340
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:26,952
But I'll need a wakeup call.

341
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:30,490
I'll be fast sleep,
counting horses instead of sheep.

342
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:59,120
How the times have changed...

343
00:31:27,752 --> 00:31:30,949
- You got your gun on you? - Yes.

344
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:38,019
Go back and give it to him.
- Okay.

345
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:41,856
Why take a chance?

346
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:44,526
- Meet me in the parking lot.
- Okay.

347
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:52,035
I want my money back. One lakh.

348
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,208
- He only has pennies.

349
00:31:58,449 --> 00:31:59,507
Look for his ATM card.

350
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,948
You want to become a bookie,
don't you?

351
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:08,786
- I'll get it done in a jiffy.

352
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,161
Let's just give the gun and leave.

353
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,306
Packing the whole hotel in or what?

354
00:32:43,194 --> 00:32:45,389
Help! Room Service!

355
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:48,089
This way!

356
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:02,230
Come along!

357
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:03,865
Shut it!

358
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,880
What was that?

359
00:34:33,504 --> 00:34:38,305
Stop the car!
Damn it! Stop the car!

360
00:34:47,318 --> 00:34:48,808
They're getting away!

361
00:34:48,886 --> 00:34:49,944
Stop them!

362
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:02,126
Damn! Cops! We are screwed!

363
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,258
Don't freak out!

364
00:35:03,868 --> 00:35:06,029
Steve... pass my shades! My shades!

365
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,164
We'll make it, don't worry.

366
00:35:17,882 --> 00:35:18,940
That was close.

367
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:22,448
- You knew that guy? - Nope!

368
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:25,448
Then why did you salute him?

369
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:28,285
Because he saluted me!

370
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:29,849
Why would a cop salute you?

371
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,207
What!?

372
00:35:53,017 --> 00:35:55,884
Hey junkies... What the hell?

373
00:36:04,028 --> 00:36:06,121
Sir, seems like it was a major deal.

374
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:09,026
And it went wrong!

375
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,825
On the floor where we
found the dead bodies...

376
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:15,200
the security cameras were damaged

377
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:17,766
What are you doing?

378
00:36:23,814 --> 00:36:25,111
- Did you have prior information?

379
00:36:27,285 --> 00:36:30,379
We were expecting someone but...

380
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:33,456
did you check the
other security cameras?

381
00:36:33,824 --> 00:36:34,916
- No, it's being done.
- Then do it!

382
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,268
You want to talk?

383
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,204
Okay... move it!

384
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:01,910
- Where the hell are you?
- Afghanibhai...

385
00:37:04,121 --> 00:37:06,351
There's a problem.
We were leaving the hotel...

386
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:10,087
but got stuck in a
crossfire between two gangs.

387
00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:13,056
- You are still in Panvel?
- Yes...

388
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:15,291
and the DCP is here as well.

389
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:18,061
It's difficult to leave.

390
00:37:18,135 --> 00:37:19,193
Like I care!

391
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:23,830
We fixed the
delivery as per your time.

392
00:37:24,475 --> 00:37:26,841
- I get it but...

393
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:28,435
please try and understand.

394
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:31,340
Try telling this to Tashi.
I'll hand him the phone.

395
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:36,881
Look, security is tight
and sniffer dogs are around.

396
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:38,717
What's more important?

397
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:40,154
Guitar's safety
or scheduled delivery?

398
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:43,188
Fine! Commit a final time!

399
00:37:44,228 --> 00:37:46,992
Problem, safety and all that.
Tell me!

400
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:49,892
- Eight... - Eight o'clock.

401
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:51,292
Tomorrow morning?

402
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:55,204
Why don't you come over here...

403
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,298
and collect it yourself.

404
00:38:06,317 --> 00:38:11,084
OK! But eight means eight, clear?

405
00:38:11,155 --> 00:38:12,315
Loud and clear!

406
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:14,349
By the way...

407
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:18,261
- the guitar is safe?
- Should I play a tune?

408
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:20,126
- See you tomorrow. - Tune?

409
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:44,177
- Where is Sweety?
- Tear this place apart!

410
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:48,816
Tell me or I'll break your head!

411
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:56,187
He is Charlie's brother.

412
00:39:57,828 --> 00:39:58,886
Charlie who?

413
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:02,090
That gambler from the train yard!

414
00:40:10,174 --> 00:40:12,267
- Chief, there is
good news and bad news.

415
00:40:14,278 --> 00:40:16,974
He seems to be a nice guy.

416
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:18,810
- Works for an NGO besides...

417
00:40:18,883 --> 00:40:20,077
Bad! Give me the bad!

418
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:23,117
They genuinely love each other!

419
00:40:25,022 --> 00:40:26,080
They're getting married.

420
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:28,416
- I could stop it if you say so.

421
00:40:29,493 --> 00:40:30,755
But they do look like...

422
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:33,092
they're made for each other.

423
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:35,530
I'll get your mom hooked up
with him!

424
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:38,962
- Get me Sweety on the phone!
- Yes, Chief!

425
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:41,863
- As soon as I get there.

426
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:31,900
Damn it! What's going on!

427
00:44:33,203 --> 00:44:35,000
From the frying pan into the fire...

428
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:38,307
and back into the frying pan!

429
00:44:39,777 --> 00:44:40,869
Forget it.

430
00:44:41,478 --> 00:44:44,845
Don't even think about it!

431
00:44:46,417 --> 00:44:48,078
Just get away!

432
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:04,391
Charlie...

433
00:45:05,269 --> 00:45:06,463
The shortcut...

434
00:45:07,471 --> 00:45:09,302
or the shorter fhortcut!

435
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,832
-But...
- But what?

436
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:14,435
Don't forget!

437
00:45:14,978 --> 00:45:19,005
The path you choose
doesn't screw your life...

438
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:21,145
what screws you is...

439
00:45:21,985 --> 00:45:24,886
the one you leave behind!

440
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:52,075
Greetings, everyone.

441
00:45:52,483 --> 00:45:53,973
Please remain seated.

442
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:57,011
- Sweety dear...

443
00:46:00,124 --> 00:46:01,182
- Where have you been?

444
00:46:02,292 --> 00:46:04,157
Been looking all over for you.

445
00:46:11,034 --> 00:46:14,834
Greetings! I am your brother-in-law.

446
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:26,147
I consider myself an
lndian first and then a Marathi.

447
00:46:26,884 --> 00:46:29,819
But what annoys me is
that my house guest...

448
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:31,278
who shares my food...

449
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:33,017
shares my wages...

450
00:46:33,323 --> 00:46:34,381
drinks my milk...

451
00:46:34,892 --> 00:46:36,291
saves the butter for his own toast.

452
00:46:37,327 --> 00:46:39,124
How is that fair?

453
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:41,192
- Now even... - Cut!

454
00:46:49,206 --> 00:46:50,264
Brother...

455
00:46:51,508 --> 00:46:53,100
Why are you doing this to me?

456
00:46:55,179 --> 00:46:59,809
I wanted to make your
wedding a grand affair.

457
00:47:01,952 --> 00:47:03,419
Why did you hurt me?

458
00:47:04,421 --> 00:47:09,688
You wanted me to marry
that builder's son...

459
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:14,197
And who is this boy?
What is his name?

460
00:47:15,065 --> 00:47:16,123
- Tell me...

461
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:18,392
Sanjay...

462
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:23,871
Sanjay? Give me his full name!

463
00:47:23,941 --> 00:47:26,273
Sanjay Kumar Sharma, son
of Kishan Kumar Sharma...

464
00:47:26,376 --> 00:47:28,139
bows to the 25 crore
Gods and Goddesses...

465
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:29,338
Hang on!!

466
00:47:29,446 --> 00:47:31,346
Come again. What is his name?

467
00:47:33,884 --> 00:47:34,942
Sanjay Kumar Sharma.

468
00:47:35,152 --> 00:47:36,244
Sanjay Kumar Sharma?

469
00:47:36,453 --> 00:47:38,944
- Where are you from?

470
00:47:40,123 --> 00:47:41,181
Barabanki.

471
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:43,926
Barabanki? U.P.

472
00:47:43,994 --> 00:47:45,291
Holy crap!

473
00:47:46,463 --> 00:47:50,229
Give me the phone.
Just give the damn phone!

474
00:47:51,835 --> 00:47:53,268
Chief... we are screwed!

475
00:47:53,837 --> 00:47:57,898
He is a bloody migrant, from U.P.!

476
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:00,999
- We've identified the dead bodies.

477
00:48:01,745 --> 00:48:02,803
They belong to the KD Narang gang.

478
00:48:03,747 --> 00:48:05,977
But the boy in the camera footage...

479
00:48:06,416 --> 00:48:08,976
- Don't know how he
is connected to this.

480
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:10,177
Investigations are still on.

481
00:48:12,789 --> 00:48:13,847
This way, Sir...

482
00:48:13,957 --> 00:48:15,015
Play it.

483
00:48:16,793 --> 00:48:18,920
Rewind... slower...

484
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:22,298
Get him! Closer.

485
00:49:16,753 --> 00:49:18,015
Beat the crap out of him.

486
00:49:19,756 --> 00:49:21,849
Bloody migrant!

487
00:49:22,259 --> 00:49:23,351
Let him go...

488
00:49:23,427 --> 00:49:26,794
I would've killed you right now...

489
00:49:30,233 --> 00:49:32,167
You sons of bitches!

490
00:49:32,336 --> 00:49:35,203
- Leave him... - Sweety get away!

491
00:49:37,341 --> 00:49:38,365
Guddu, get up!

492
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:41,137
Dare not touch him!

493
00:49:44,081 --> 00:49:45,946
Don't you get it?

494
00:49:47,451 --> 00:49:51,285
Your chief is ready to
trade his sister for votes.

495
00:49:51,355 --> 00:49:54,813
I don't want to marry
that builder's wretched son.

496
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:58,453
At least you should've
supported me.

497
00:49:59,896 --> 00:50:01,830
- I'll speak to chief...
- Back off!

498
00:50:03,367 --> 00:50:04,425
You...

499
00:50:05,769 --> 00:50:09,170
Get the car keys. Move it!

500
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,308
To hell with the polictics...

501
00:50:12,376 --> 00:50:13,866
that builder's son...

502
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:15,069
To hell with brother!

503
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:16,270
I'll talk to him...

504
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:21,909
Douse the fire!

505
00:50:25,489 --> 00:50:27,081
They're getting away!

506
00:51:52,843 --> 00:51:56,301
Awesome! Killer stuff!

507
00:51:56,913 --> 00:51:57,971
Where did you get it from?

508
00:51:59,916 --> 00:52:00,905
How much do I get?

509
00:52:00,984 --> 00:52:02,042
How much do you want?

510
00:52:03,987 --> 00:52:05,045
Ten!

511
00:52:05,188 --> 00:52:06,382
You got it!

512
00:52:08,325 --> 00:52:09,383
Lakhs!

513
00:52:12,863 --> 00:52:13,921
For one packet?

514
00:52:16,433 --> 00:52:17,491
A hundred packets!

515
00:52:26,009 --> 00:52:27,067
A hundred!

516
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:34,215
You created a ruckus at
the hotel, didn't you?

517
00:52:36,052 --> 00:52:38,020
I told you to leave immediately.

518
00:52:39,923 --> 00:52:41,891
Leaving wouldn't have helped.

519
00:52:42,792 --> 00:52:45,818
Opportunity came
knocking and I grabbed it!

520
00:52:46,096 --> 00:52:47,188
Lady luck smiled on me!

521
00:53:03,046 --> 00:53:04,070
A hundred packets of...

522
00:53:04,147 --> 00:53:06,240
cocaine!

523
00:53:07,317 --> 00:53:08,375
- And they belong to?

524
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:11,778
Us!

525
00:53:14,391 --> 00:53:15,915
What will you do with ten lakhs?

526
00:53:23,767 --> 00:53:24,825
I'll become a bookie.

527
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:28,428
You bloody scoundrel!

528
00:53:28,838 --> 00:53:31,398
Open your mouth
- ha ha ha!

529
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:34,777
No...

530
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:39,106
- With a hundred
packets we'll make enough...

531
00:53:39,182 --> 00:53:41,480
- to own the entire racecourse!

532
00:53:42,352 --> 00:53:43,410
And then!

533
00:53:46,156 --> 00:53:50,889
Spain... France...
Miami... Copacabana...

534
00:53:50,961 --> 00:53:52,223
Psychedelic Trance! Dude!

535
00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:55,188
Come on!

536
00:53:56,933 --> 00:53:57,991
Let's rock!

537
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:00,730
Shake the booty!

538
00:54:09,346 --> 00:54:11,576
Come, let's wring our hearts

539
00:54:12,048 --> 00:54:14,573
Smash the pot of the night

540
00:54:14,718 --> 00:54:16,982
Come, let's pry out some good luck

541
00:54:17,053 --> 00:54:19,521
Let's break into the vault

542
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:33,467
Tiny sprouts of leafy cress,
and oil from oilman's press

543
00:54:33,536 --> 00:54:36,972
Life is nothing but money's play

544
00:54:44,014 --> 00:54:46,608
Let's have a face-off
on the roads tonight

545
00:55:24,621 --> 00:55:27,112
Step out Life is a one way

546
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:29,181
All you get is one chance

547
00:55:29,793 --> 00:55:31,454
Nothing ahead but thin air

548
00:55:31,528 --> 00:55:34,554
And the romance lasts
till the breath does

549
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,812
This is what they say

550
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:55,447
This is what we hear

551
00:55:55,585 --> 00:55:57,450
Whosoever surges ahead

552
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:00,045
Never does come back

553
00:56:00,490 --> 00:56:02,754
Come, let's wring tomorrow

554
00:56:03,159 --> 00:56:05,354
Smash the pot of the night

555
00:56:05,628 --> 00:56:08,256
Come, let's pry out some good luck

556
00:56:08,331 --> 00:56:11,198
Tonight, let's break into the vault

557
00:56:11,735 --> 00:56:14,226
Tiny sprouts of leafy cress,
and oil from oilman's press

558
00:56:14,304 --> 00:56:16,704
Life is nothing but money's play

559
00:56:16,773 --> 00:56:19,469
Let's have a face-off
on the roads tonight

560
00:56:32,455 --> 00:56:34,286
Looks like an amateur crook.

561
00:56:35,291 --> 00:56:38,749
The revolver, money,
everything is still here.

562
00:56:41,798 --> 00:56:42,856
Is anything missing?

563
00:56:44,334 --> 00:56:46,802
This time lets play such a game

564
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:48,804
That the ocean walks
over the bridge

565
00:56:49,606 --> 00:56:51,665
Then whether you
walk on the bridge or l

566
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:54,141
The city will stay under our feet

567
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:56,879
Somewhere the news are grave

568
00:56:56,946 --> 00:56:59,210
Somewhere there are just graves

569
00:56:59,282 --> 00:57:03,719
Hush! Let's not wake up the dead

570
00:57:03,887 --> 00:57:06,651
Come, let's wring our hearts

571
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:09,585
Smash the pot of the night

572
00:57:09,959 --> 00:57:12,359
Come, let's pry out some good luck

573
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:14,897
Let's break into the vault

574
00:57:36,886 --> 00:57:38,854
Dhan te nan...!

575
00:57:59,676 --> 00:58:01,143
I've got the tickets and passports.

576
00:58:01,511 --> 00:58:03,411
Go and freshen up soon!

577
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:11,815
I'll get the first-aid box.
Hurry up!

578
00:58:15,758 --> 00:58:18,488
- We will miss the flight!
What is wrong with you?

579
00:58:41,651 --> 00:58:42,777
What's wrong?

580
00:58:46,789 --> 00:58:51,385
I almost flunked
in the sixth grade.

581
00:58:54,564 --> 00:58:55,622
What?

582
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:09,205
We sat on the same bench.

583
00:59:09,345 --> 00:59:10,403
Both of us.

584
00:59:13,082 --> 00:59:14,140
Who both?

585
00:59:17,153 --> 00:59:18,211
Sabiha and l.

586
00:59:21,157 --> 00:59:23,148
Sabiha Laeek Ahmed.

587
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:27,655
I was in love with her.

588
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:34,131
She loved hearing s...

589
00:59:34,203 --> 00:59:35,795
stories from me.

590
00:59:38,541 --> 00:59:40,133
Champak, Nandan...

591
00:59:41,778 --> 00:59:43,177
Bela Bahadur... comics.

592
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:49,111
Then one day I realised...

593
00:59:49,185 --> 00:59:52,643
it wasn't the stories she loved.

594
00:59:57,393 --> 01:00:02,763
It was my fumbling
that made her laugh.

595
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:07,494
Once I caught her...

596
01:00:07,570 --> 01:00:10,664
imitating me.

597
01:00:12,508 --> 01:00:13,873
Gh... gh... gh.

598
01:00:17,747 --> 01:00:19,146
That's when I realised that...

599
01:00:19,215 --> 01:00:22,275
not only do I stammer...

600
01:00:22,352 --> 01:00:29,224
but I'm a duffer too.

601
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:32,686
Listen...

602
01:00:32,762 --> 01:00:36,528
you can narrate the rest
at the a... a... aiirp...

603
01:00:36,599 --> 01:00:37,657
Just remembered, didn't you?

604
01:00:39,535 --> 01:00:40,593
The stammer?

605
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:46,601
What happened back
there at the war zone?

606
01:00:48,211 --> 01:00:49,235
Forgot your cues?

607
01:00:55,184 --> 01:00:58,711
Why pull this farce on me?

608
01:01:04,794 --> 01:01:06,659
How many more lies?

609
01:01:18,608 --> 01:01:21,805
- Every lie had an honest intention...
- Another lie!

610
01:01:37,493 --> 01:01:39,427
- We'll miss our flight...
- What's the hurry?

611
01:01:45,802 --> 01:01:47,929
Let's get to know
each other better.

612
01:01:51,841 --> 01:01:52,899
I'm your wife.

613
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:55,234
That's a lie!

614
01:01:56,846 --> 01:01:58,837
You are Bhope's sister!

615
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:06,154
- I'm carrying your child. - Really?

616
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:07,781
Are you sure it's mine?

617
01:02:13,129 --> 01:02:15,825
I'll kill you!

618
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:14,514
- Cheater!

619
01:03:22,899 --> 01:03:24,161
You'll die soon!

620
01:03:26,769 --> 01:03:29,169
As if you'll live forever!

621
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:32,199
- How about I slit your throat?

622
01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:37,737
Do you know the stuff's worth?

623
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:42,348
Ten crores!

624
01:03:45,154 --> 01:03:46,212
Crores?

625
01:03:49,625 --> 01:03:50,683
The stuff is worth ten crores!?

626
01:03:51,894 --> 01:03:55,523
Yeah man! Ten crores!

627
01:03:57,266 --> 01:03:58,324
At least.

628
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:02,137
Go on darling...

629
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:04,731
get the stuff, quick!

630
01:04:06,776 --> 01:04:07,834
I'll set up some deals till then.

631
01:04:10,313 --> 01:04:12,645
Now get going!

632
01:04:13,783 --> 01:04:14,841
Ten!!! Arsehole!

633
01:04:26,662 --> 01:04:28,493
- I'll be back in five.
- Make it quick!

634
01:04:36,806 --> 01:04:38,205
Hello... big bro...

635
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:45,438
Staying alive...

636
01:04:45,915 --> 01:04:49,510
Staying alive...

637
01:04:56,525 --> 01:05:00,256
- Stop behaving like the
bride and lend me a hand!

638
01:05:01,864 --> 01:05:03,525
Please come in Mr Sharma.

639
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,197
- Sorry... we barged in unannounced!

640
01:05:07,837 --> 01:05:11,238
We waited outside for a while...

641
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:13,000
but we were hungry...

642
01:05:13,342 --> 01:05:16,539
so we came in, hoping to
find something to eat.

643
01:05:18,347 --> 01:05:21,214
Nothing beats fresh
burgers on a rainy day!

644
01:05:25,154 --> 01:05:26,553
Please have a seat.

645
01:05:38,167 --> 01:05:39,156
- To tell you the truth...

646
01:05:40,102 --> 01:05:41,967
we are looking for the groom.

647
01:05:43,406 --> 01:05:45,271
Excuse me?

648
01:05:46,375 --> 01:05:47,433
- Guddu.

649
01:06:01,857 --> 01:06:03,984
How many brothers are you?

650
01:06:07,396 --> 01:06:08,454
Two.

651
01:06:09,398 --> 01:06:10,524
If you were three...

652
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:13,527
would you parade me naked?

653
01:06:16,238 --> 01:06:17,296
What do you do?

654
01:06:17,907 --> 01:06:19,397
- Builder, chief... Body builder!

655
01:06:23,079 --> 01:06:25,343
Wow Mr Sharma...

656
01:06:25,815 --> 01:06:27,407
I'm impressed!

657
01:06:30,086 --> 01:06:31,144
Do you have a sister?

658
01:06:34,423 --> 01:06:35,481
I have one.

659
01:06:37,293 --> 01:06:38,419
Your brother screwed her.

660
01:06:39,895 --> 01:06:41,487
And now they're getting married.

661
01:06:43,366 --> 01:06:44,424
Weren't you invited?

662
01:06:47,203 --> 01:06:48,295
Doesn't matter now...

663
01:06:49,205 --> 01:06:50,263
neither was l.

664
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:53,900
Where can we find him?

665
01:06:57,046 --> 01:06:58,775
It's been three years since...

666
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:00,509
I saw his shitty face.

667
01:07:01,384 --> 01:07:02,442
I swear!

668
01:07:04,987 --> 01:07:06,045
Right now...

669
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:09,320
I need to take care of
something important.

670
01:07:10,526 --> 01:07:13,927
- I'll call you once
I hear from him.

671
01:07:14,263 --> 01:07:15,321
- Can I have your fell number?

672
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:21,328
What's he saying?

673
01:07:22,905 --> 01:07:23,997
Which number?

674
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:25,932
Fell.

675
01:07:26,942 --> 01:07:28,000
Mobile.

676
01:07:31,347 --> 01:07:32,541
Do you lisp?

677
01:07:36,952 --> 01:07:39,887
Not really... I pronounce S as F...

678
01:07:40,222 --> 01:07:43,282
If not as F, will
you pronounce it as L?

679
01:07:46,762 --> 01:07:48,889
- What about your brother?

680
01:07:49,432 --> 01:07:50,490
Does he lisp as well?

681
01:07:54,370 --> 01:07:55,394
He stammers.

682
01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:01,035
- One lisps and...

683
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:03,037
- the other stammers!

684
01:08:23,332 --> 01:08:24,390
- Where is he?

685
01:08:26,402 --> 01:08:28,529
- He is inside. But
there is some confusion.

686
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:30,197
This way.

687
01:08:35,211 --> 01:08:37,406
I'm tired of repeating myself.

688
01:08:38,347 --> 01:08:41,077
You can't keep me here,
without a warrant.

689
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:42,742
- This is against the law.
- Against the law?

690
01:08:43,285 --> 01:08:45,344
- We'll take it from here.
Thank you. - Sir?

691
01:08:47,890 --> 01:08:48,948
Didn't you hear him?

692
01:08:50,025 --> 01:08:52,493
Get moving. Now!

693
01:08:57,032 --> 01:08:59,364
The law does not p... p...

694
01:08:59,401 --> 01:09:00,493
permit this?

695
01:09:01,403 --> 01:09:02,461
So you're the lawmaker now?

696
01:09:03,772 --> 01:09:08,300
There has been a misunders...
s... s...

697
01:09:09,778 --> 01:09:11,040
Here... have a seat.

698
01:09:11,847 --> 01:09:12,905
Sit down!

699
01:09:18,387 --> 01:09:19,513
I... I...

700
01:09:20,256 --> 01:09:22,918
I'm not who you th... th...

701
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:25,392
think I am.

702
01:09:25,928 --> 01:09:26,986
And who is that?

703
01:09:27,396 --> 01:09:29,523
I'm not Ch... Ch... Ch...

704
01:09:30,132 --> 01:09:31,190
Chimpanzee!

705
01:09:32,434 --> 01:09:34,527
That's what we are!

706
01:09:35,237 --> 01:09:36,397
- Where's the guitar?

707
01:09:39,875 --> 01:09:41,934
What gui... gui...

708
01:09:45,281 --> 01:09:47,340
This is going to take all night!

709
01:09:50,886 --> 01:09:52,012
Why don't you sing something?

710
01:09:53,155 --> 01:09:54,213
Sing?

711
01:09:56,425 --> 01:09:57,824
- What? - A song!

712
01:10:02,898 --> 01:10:04,024
Can't get it started.

713
01:10:05,367 --> 01:10:07,801
- Water might have
seeped in. - Take your time!

714
01:10:09,371 --> 01:10:11,362
Have you ever met him?

715
01:10:12,341 --> 01:10:14,502
- No. - Good for you.
You've been lucky!

716
01:10:15,444 --> 01:10:17,912
He brings misfortune!

717
01:10:18,113 --> 01:10:19,774
There could be no worse omen...

718
01:10:19,848 --> 01:10:22,510
than to see his shitty face.

719
01:10:23,118 --> 01:10:25,518
You mentioned him and
my phone conked out!

720
01:10:30,459 --> 01:10:31,517
What's going on here?

721
01:10:32,394 --> 01:10:33,793
I'm out in the rain cracking deals...

722
01:10:33,862 --> 01:10:36,126
and you're chilling in here!

723
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:39,056
Mikhail, I'll be out
with you in a bit!

724
01:10:40,869 --> 01:10:41,961
Hold on...

725
01:10:45,341 --> 01:10:46,865
- Something smells fishy!

726
01:10:50,346 --> 01:10:51,472
Hey you...

727
01:10:54,883 --> 01:10:57,078
- Are you giving my
brother a hard time?

728
01:11:00,022 --> 01:11:02,149
Chief, hold on to your pants!

729
01:11:02,825 --> 01:11:04,884
The third brother is here!

730
01:11:08,364 --> 01:11:11,356
You don't get it,
Mikhail. He is Chief Bhope.

731
01:11:11,433 --> 01:11:12,991
- Chief... who? - Chief Bhope!

732
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:14,160
- You should leave. - So?

733
01:11:17,373 --> 01:11:18,465
I'm Chief Tope!

734
01:11:20,109 --> 01:11:22,907
Chief Tope, Chief Bhope,
Chief Chief Bhope Tope...

735
01:11:22,978 --> 01:11:24,240
Chief Bhope Chief Tope...

736
01:11:24,313 --> 01:11:25,905
Bhope Tope Chief Tope Bhope Chief...

737
01:11:25,981 --> 01:11:27,505
Bhope Tope Boom!

738
01:11:29,385 --> 01:11:31,114
- The stuff has been sold.

739
01:11:31,987 --> 01:11:33,045
- So kindly leave.

740
01:11:33,922 --> 01:11:36,789
Or I'll pluck out your
chilli and two nuts...

741
01:11:36,859 --> 01:11:39,453
and pawn them at the
traffic signal. Got it!?

742
01:11:40,195 --> 01:11:42,857
- You still don't get it!
- No, no... hold it!

743
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:46,758
- He gets everything!

744
01:11:47,369 --> 01:11:49,963
- Chief Tope, this way...
- Watch it!

745
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:53,271
You're a great man.

746
01:11:54,076 --> 01:11:55,407
I bow down to...

747
01:11:55,477 --> 01:11:57,468
the dude of this century!

748
01:11:57,746 --> 01:11:58,872
Why don't you have a seat,
please...

749
01:12:01,083 --> 01:12:02,880
A burger... quick!

750
01:12:05,154 --> 01:12:07,281
We are two brothers...

751
01:12:10,426 --> 01:12:12,360
Identical twins...

752
01:12:16,098 --> 01:12:22,469
thus we look the same.

753
01:12:22,871 --> 01:12:23,963
Brother...

754
01:12:26,041 --> 01:12:27,099
you are great!

755
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:29,804
- Doesn't stammer while singing.

756
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:33,038
- Go on...

757
01:12:34,383 --> 01:12:35,509
Listen, he...

758
01:12:38,787 --> 01:12:39,845
Keep singing.

759
01:12:45,994 --> 01:12:48,326
He's an arsehole...

760
01:12:50,132 --> 01:12:53,966
A bloody scoundrel...

761
01:12:56,338 --> 01:12:58,738
He does the deed...

762
01:12:58,807 --> 01:13:00,741
And I pay the price...

763
01:13:00,809 --> 01:13:03,471
Always been so.

764
01:13:07,149 --> 01:13:09,481
If each of your fingers...

765
01:13:10,352 --> 01:13:13,082
is worth a crore...

766
01:13:14,156 --> 01:13:16,488
Then five fingers...

767
01:13:16,825 --> 01:13:18,884
would be worth how much more?

768
01:13:20,028 --> 01:13:21,086
- How much?

769
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:24,490
Five...

770
01:13:28,771 --> 01:13:29,795
Ten...

771
01:13:29,872 --> 01:13:33,968
With your ten excuses
you stole my heart away...

772
01:13:34,042 --> 01:13:35,373
Arsehole!

773
01:13:35,444 --> 01:13:36,502
Kiddo!!

774
01:13:43,452 --> 01:13:45,249
There is powder worth
ten crores in the guitar.

775
01:13:46,188 --> 01:13:48,247
If we don't get it back,
we are dead.

776
01:13:49,858 --> 01:13:50,984
And so are you!

777
01:13:51,794 --> 01:13:54,854
That's my br... br... brother...

778
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:58,764
Cha... Charlie's ph... ph... photo.

779
01:13:58,867 --> 01:14:02,064
I'm Gu... Guddu.

780
01:14:04,773 --> 01:14:07,469
- Here's your burger!

781
01:14:09,478 --> 01:14:12,003
What deal were you talking about?

782
01:14:12,347 --> 01:14:14,144
- None of your business!

783
01:14:15,751 --> 01:14:16,809
- Alright...

784
01:14:17,085 --> 01:14:18,882
- at least tell me its worth.

785
01:14:20,355 --> 01:14:22,289
I haven't plucked your stuff yet.

786
01:14:22,891 --> 01:14:24,153
How can I sell it?

787
01:14:26,829 --> 01:14:28,490
Will this chilli do?

788
01:14:29,832 --> 01:14:32,995
Or should I pluck the real one out?

789
01:14:33,168 --> 01:14:35,159
- The phone is working now.

790
01:14:35,871 --> 01:14:37,361
Mikhail... wait outside...
I'll join you.

791
01:14:37,406 --> 01:14:38,464
Why are you winking at me?

792
01:14:39,775 --> 01:14:40,833
Why should I leave?

793
01:14:42,177 --> 01:14:43,235
They should be the ones leaving.

794
01:14:44,179 --> 01:14:47,307
It's time you and
your circus troupe left.

795
01:14:47,382 --> 01:14:48,440
Circus troupe?

796
01:14:48,851 --> 01:14:51,513
Or I may have to stuff the chilli.

797
01:14:53,255 --> 01:14:55,780
- As in? - You know what we do...

798
01:14:55,858 --> 01:14:59,316
when a horse refuses to run?

799
01:15:00,262 --> 01:15:01,320
We stuff the chilli up the horse!

800
01:15:02,931 --> 01:15:04,455
How it takes off then...

801
01:15:04,533 --> 01:15:07,400
Tik tok tik tok tik tok tik tok.

802
01:15:08,237 --> 01:15:09,295
Later on...

803
01:15:10,906 --> 01:15:12,237
to catch up with it...

804
01:15:13,075 --> 01:15:15,339
- the jockey sticks
two up his own! - Two?

805
01:15:16,078 --> 01:15:23,416
Zip zap zip zap zip zap.

806
01:15:28,290 --> 01:15:30,815
- Our way of dealing with...

807
01:15:30,893 --> 01:15:35,557
Iaggards is a little different.

808
01:15:38,433 --> 01:15:42,096
We don't try to make them run.

809
01:15:44,373 --> 01:15:47,501
We just blow them off.

810
01:16:28,216 --> 01:16:29,274
Mikhail...

811
01:16:31,153 --> 01:16:34,350
Call him! Your cell...

812
01:16:35,424 --> 01:16:36,482
Call now!

813
01:16:39,828 --> 01:16:42,353
I know he's inside,
please let me meet him.

814
01:16:42,431 --> 01:16:45,161
- It's not allowed. The
interrogation is still on.

815
01:16:45,233 --> 01:16:47,201
Why not? What's his crime?

816
01:16:47,302 --> 01:16:49,065
We'll drop him home
after the interrogation.

817
01:16:49,204 --> 01:16:50,762
I'll report this to the media!

818
01:16:51,473 --> 01:16:54,237
- Remember the
Rehman-ur-Rehman case? - Very well.

819
01:16:54,309 --> 01:16:56,903
- The Police Commissioner
got transferred! - Like I care!

820
01:16:57,913 --> 01:17:00,507
I'll make sure you lose your job!

821
01:17:00,916 --> 01:17:02,907
Go and do as you wish!

822
01:17:02,985 --> 01:17:04,179
I'm not going anywhere!

823
01:17:06,521 --> 01:17:08,045
Arrest me as well.

824
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:12,052
- Patil! Send
lnspector Manju over here.

825
01:17:12,394 --> 01:17:13,861
- Fine, we'll arrest you as well.

826
01:17:15,397 --> 01:17:18,332
My husband is in there, let me go...

827
01:17:19,134 --> 01:17:21,534
- Stop her! - Guddu... Guddu...

828
01:17:22,304 --> 01:17:24,101
- I swear I don't have it.

829
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:26,000
- Where is it?

830
01:17:26,408 --> 01:17:28,535
- Don't you understand?
- Please listen...

831
01:17:28,944 --> 01:17:30,411
- What is this ruckus?

832
01:17:31,013 --> 01:17:32,537
Prateek, what's going on?

833
01:17:33,148 --> 01:17:34,479
She forced her way in.

834
01:17:36,018 --> 01:17:37,542
I beg you to let him go.

835
01:17:39,755 --> 01:17:41,950
- She is his wife... - Whose wife?

836
01:17:42,824 --> 01:17:44,815
- Please leave my foot.
Calm her down!

837
01:17:44,893 --> 01:17:46,417
- He is innocent. - Okay...

838
01:17:47,029 --> 01:17:48,223
- Sir, please... - Alright!

839
01:18:01,910 --> 01:18:05,107
- Yes, Charlie is with me.

840
01:18:06,381 --> 01:18:07,439
- She's my sister.

841
01:18:09,251 --> 01:18:10,912
Treat her with respect!

842
01:18:18,193 --> 01:18:19,319
Put Shinde on the line...

843
01:18:59,801 --> 01:19:00,893
Shinde...

844
01:19:01,203 --> 01:19:02,261
Prateek...

845
01:19:02,471 --> 01:19:04,871
Go and prepare the Nagpal
Case report.

846
01:19:04,973 --> 01:19:06,304
- But Sir... - Get going!

847
01:19:16,118 --> 01:19:18,518
We are in a war like situation.

848
01:19:20,989 --> 01:19:23,184
That too, it's a biological war.

849
01:19:24,860 --> 01:19:26,191
And your brother is
on the enemies' side.

850
01:19:27,929 --> 01:19:31,057
The cocaine belongs to the
government, belongs to us...

851
01:19:31,133 --> 01:19:32,225
and he has stolen that.

852
01:19:34,035 --> 01:19:36,003
So sad, isn't it?

853
01:19:37,038 --> 01:19:40,940
Mr Sharma, by this time
tomorrow you'll be in Barabanki.

854
01:19:43,278 --> 01:19:45,872
- Mumbai police! Everyone out!

855
01:19:45,947 --> 01:19:47,005
- This way please.

856
01:19:47,082 --> 01:19:48,743
Please alight the train.

857
01:19:48,817 --> 01:19:49,875
Ma'am, you too... soon.

858
01:19:50,752 --> 01:19:52,276
- Out... everyone.

859
01:19:53,889 --> 01:19:59,486
- Please cooperate with us.
- Relax...

860
01:20:03,899 --> 01:20:04,957
This is for you.

861
01:20:05,901 --> 01:20:08,301
Now you'll be free
of Bhope's clutches.

862
01:20:09,271 --> 01:20:10,363
Please have a seat.

863
01:20:15,911 --> 01:20:17,105
Finally!

864
01:20:22,984 --> 01:20:24,042
Please eat something!

865
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:26,912
You haven't eaten a thing.

866
01:20:33,929 --> 01:20:37,330
Don't vent your anger
on this poor burger.

867
01:20:42,170 --> 01:20:43,728
You wouldn't even look at me.

868
01:20:46,341 --> 01:20:47,399
Do you remember?

869
01:20:48,343 --> 01:20:49,742
- If I didn't pretend to stammer...

870
01:20:49,811 --> 01:20:52,279
- you wouldn't have spoken to me.

871
01:20:54,416 --> 01:20:56,475
- Stuck in your own shell...

872
01:20:57,085 --> 01:20:58,279
- aloof from the rest of the world.

873
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:14,291
I left everything behind for you.

874
01:21:15,804 --> 01:21:17,465
And all those things you said to me!

875
01:21:21,376 --> 01:21:22,502
Please forgive me.

876
01:21:28,450 --> 01:21:29,508
If it weren't for you...

877
01:21:31,052 --> 01:21:34,920
I wouldn't have gone
for the speech therapy.

878
01:21:36,925 --> 01:21:37,983
See...

879
01:21:39,461 --> 01:21:40,928
I don't get stuck on S anymore.

880
01:21:46,167 --> 01:21:49,967
I agree I'm a psy... psy...

881
01:21:50,839 --> 01:21:51,931
Psycho!

882
01:21:53,875 --> 01:21:57,470
No, a psycho's husband!

883
01:22:04,819 --> 01:22:07,083
Move it... clear it...

884
01:22:32,180 --> 01:22:33,511
Damn it! Answer the phone!

885
01:22:36,051 --> 01:22:37,109
- Where are you?

886
01:22:37,185 --> 01:22:41,246
- We talked about five people,
I can see six.

887
01:22:41,323 --> 01:22:43,450
So shoot one down...
but where are you?

888
01:22:44,259 --> 01:22:45,851
- Behind you.

889
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:57,737
The exchange will
happen in our compartment...

890
01:22:58,340 --> 01:23:00,399
- at the next stop.

891
01:23:01,209 --> 01:23:06,408
- Where's Charlie? - Charlie...

892
01:23:28,870 --> 01:23:29,962
Don't do this.

893
01:23:30,772 --> 01:23:34,970
- Killing me won't help you.
- And keeping you alive will?

894
01:23:35,977 --> 01:23:40,107
- I'll give you one
crore rupees. - That's it?

895
01:23:43,385 --> 01:23:44,443
One and half.

896
01:23:49,190 --> 01:23:51,181
Two... two and half...

897
01:23:51,393 --> 01:23:53,258
You lisping jerk!

898
01:23:54,896 --> 01:23:59,060
Had you told me
about your deal then...

899
01:23:59,868 --> 01:24:01,335
I could've let you go.

900
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:05,271
Now you can screw yourself.

901
01:24:08,910 --> 01:24:09,968
If you ever talk to
me like that again...

902
01:24:11,046 --> 01:24:13,071
I'll kill myself. I swear!

903
01:24:16,217 --> 01:24:17,275
Never again!

904
01:24:20,221 --> 01:24:22,086
I swear on our little girl.

905
01:24:23,825 --> 01:24:25,156
Not a girl, a boy!

906
01:24:27,262 --> 01:24:29,822
- Girl... - Boy...

907
01:24:29,964 --> 01:24:31,761
- A girl! - No, a boy!

908
01:24:31,833 --> 01:24:35,462
Rise and shine...

909
01:24:36,004 --> 01:24:38,165
- Are we there already? - Yes,
this is your last stop.

910
01:24:38,206 --> 01:24:41,300
- Come on. - What's the problem?

911
01:24:53,788 --> 01:24:57,121
- Five crores... five!

912
01:25:02,931 --> 01:25:03,989
Brother...

913
01:25:04,466 --> 01:25:05,831
- Six crores!

914
01:25:08,403 --> 01:25:17,471
I'll be damned!
It's Thomson and Thompson!!

915
01:25:25,954 --> 01:25:28,218
- If anybody tries to
act smart, I'll shoot her!

916
01:25:33,027 --> 01:25:35,894
- Put the gun down.
- Don't shoot her.

917
01:25:36,231 --> 01:25:38,495
- Save me. - Leave my sister!

918
01:25:41,169 --> 01:25:43,069
- I'll kill you!

919
01:25:43,171 --> 01:25:45,765
- Stop the train.
- Pull the chain! Now!

920
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:49,833
- Do as I say. - I won't spare you!

921
01:25:49,911 --> 01:25:51,970
Pull the bloody chain!

922
01:26:25,813 --> 01:26:27,280
- Where is it?

923
01:26:28,283 --> 01:26:29,341
- Where have you hidden the guitar?

924
01:26:29,951 --> 01:26:31,009
- Spit it out!

925
01:27:33,248 --> 01:27:35,341
- We are stuck at Panvel
for the last two hours.

926
01:27:37,885 --> 01:27:39,409
- It's been pouring here.

927
01:27:40,255 --> 01:27:41,916
- I'm not lying, Afghanibhai.

928
01:27:43,224 --> 01:27:45,021
- All the roads are blocked!

929
01:27:46,928 --> 01:27:49,829
- Tell me when!
- It's not possible!

930
01:27:50,298 --> 01:27:52,789
It could take hours.

931
01:27:55,003 --> 01:27:56,265
- We haven't slept at all.

932
01:27:56,371 --> 01:27:57,395
Shall I sing a lullaby?

933
01:27:58,473 --> 01:27:59,770
Tell me, should l?

934
01:28:01,909 --> 01:28:03,433
Tell him to call on
reaching the jetty.

935
01:28:05,313 --> 01:28:06,371
- Listen carefully...

936
01:28:07,181 --> 01:28:09,445
- call as soon as you reach Mumbai.

937
01:28:26,234 --> 01:28:27,326
- One...

938
01:28:30,038 --> 01:28:31,096
- two...

939
01:28:34,976 --> 01:28:39,413
Three... four... five... six...

940
01:28:40,048 --> 01:28:42,812
seven... eight... nine... ten!

941
01:28:45,753 --> 01:28:48,153
Shoot! Go on shoot!!

942
01:28:51,759 --> 01:28:52,817
Can't do it, can you?

943
01:28:54,295 --> 01:28:56,490
Our lives are trapped
in that guitar case.

944
01:28:58,166 --> 01:28:59,360
Once you lay your hands on it...

945
01:29:01,202 --> 01:29:03,397
you'll shoot me without blinking!

946
01:29:06,341 --> 01:29:07,433
Lower your gun and...

947
01:29:09,777 --> 01:29:10,835
call your boss.

948
01:29:14,048 --> 01:29:15,106
Now!

949
01:29:19,487 --> 01:29:21,512
- You want to talk to
the boss, huh?

950
01:29:26,327 --> 01:29:27,521
The car is stuck,
can you take a look?

951
01:29:27,962 --> 01:29:30,931
"Call the boss!"
It's a bloody movie or what!

952
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:35,494
- Come back now... Iittle more.

953
01:29:36,804 --> 01:29:39,068
Move forward now.

954
01:29:39,340 --> 01:29:41,274
- Accelerate... - Tell me when.

955
01:29:41,843 --> 01:29:42,901
Put it in reverse now.

956
01:29:43,211 --> 01:29:47,147
- Keep going.

957
01:29:51,919 --> 01:29:52,977
- What happened?

958
01:29:53,855 --> 01:29:55,083
You're shot! How did this happen?

959
01:29:59,494 --> 01:30:02,952
- The car skidded...
I didn't see...

960
01:30:05,767 --> 01:30:06,791
- I'm sorry...

961
01:30:08,169 --> 01:30:10,467
Let's get you up... please...

962
01:30:12,006 --> 01:30:13,439
try getting up...

963
01:30:16,778 --> 01:30:17,836
No!

964
01:30:24,285 --> 01:30:27,448
- Take grandma inside...

965
01:30:33,961 --> 01:30:35,019
- and Sweety as well.

966
01:30:39,133 --> 01:30:40,157
No, I won't.

967
01:30:46,274 --> 01:30:47,332
I'll sit right here...

968
01:30:50,278 --> 01:30:51,336
with my husband.

969
01:30:54,081 --> 01:30:55,139
- Shameless fool!

970
01:30:56,751 --> 01:30:58,150
Putting me through this hell.

971
01:31:00,788 --> 01:31:02,346
- What are you staring at?
Lower your eyes.

972
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:07,022
Is this your culture?

973
01:31:09,163 --> 01:31:12,291
- To lure innocent
girls and screw them!

974
01:31:15,770 --> 01:31:16,794
- When did you arrive here?

975
01:31:19,841 --> 01:31:22,036
- Here in Bombay? - Mumbai!

976
01:31:26,113 --> 01:31:27,444
I was born here.

977
01:31:29,016 --> 01:31:30,984
But father arrived in B...

978
01:31:32,453 --> 01:31:34,512
Bombay in 1984.

979
01:31:34,789 --> 01:31:35,847
Mumbai!

980
01:31:39,126 --> 01:31:40,388
It was called Bombay back then.

981
01:31:46,334 --> 01:31:49,826
- Bastard! It was Mumbai
then and it is Mumbai now!

982
01:31:51,839 --> 01:31:52,999
- You bloody migrants...

983
01:31:55,142 --> 01:31:57,804
are chewing the city
hollow like termites!

984
01:31:59,046 --> 01:32:00,741
The city is bursting
at it's seams...

985
01:32:00,815 --> 01:32:03,215
and you people swarm
in like flies!

986
01:32:03,784 --> 01:32:05,081
To rob our share of the pie.

987
01:32:06,954 --> 01:32:08,751
My father used to say that...

988
01:32:08,823 --> 01:32:13,487
we are like sugar added to milk.

989
01:32:15,096 --> 01:32:18,156
- If we leave,
the milk won't lessen but...

990
01:32:21,369 --> 01:32:22,393
will turn bland.

991
01:32:23,404 --> 01:32:26,373
- How thoughtful!
The chief has diabetes.

992
01:32:26,440 --> 01:32:27,907
What do we do with him?

993
01:32:30,244 --> 01:32:31,302
Listen...

994
01:32:33,381 --> 01:32:37,044
- I understand your
love for each other.

995
01:32:38,486 --> 01:32:39,714
I got a vibe in the train.

996
01:32:41,122 --> 01:32:43,249
But if my sister
marries a migrant...

997
01:32:44,725 --> 01:32:46,056
I'll be crucified!

998
01:32:48,062 --> 01:32:50,462
My grave will be dug.

999
01:32:52,133 --> 01:32:54,727
Not only will
I lose my reputation...

1000
01:32:54,769 --> 01:32:56,430
but my election fund as well.

1001
01:32:57,872 --> 01:33:01,467
The builder is paying me to
get his son and Sweety married.

1002
01:33:02,743 --> 01:33:03,801
Five crores!

1003
01:33:04,946 --> 01:33:07,744
Can you imagine how much that is?

1004
01:33:11,085 --> 01:33:12,882
There is powder worth
ten crores in the guitar.

1005
01:33:18,259 --> 01:33:19,317
How much?

1006
01:33:20,227 --> 01:33:21,751
Five whopping crores!

1007
01:33:23,764 --> 01:33:25,425
If I give you ten...

1008
01:33:26,901 --> 01:33:27,993
will you sell her to me?

1009
01:33:34,875 --> 01:33:35,933
Ten crores!

1010
01:33:38,779 --> 01:33:40,110
- I can take it all if I want.

1011
01:33:41,716 --> 01:33:45,049
- But all I want is ten lakhs.

1012
01:33:47,722 --> 01:33:48,780
What is your name?

1013
01:33:50,858 --> 01:33:53,122
Anything you want to call me!

1014
01:33:53,260 --> 01:33:54,750
Do you know who I am?

1015
01:33:56,130 --> 01:33:59,065
No... but I know
you're badly screwed!

1016
01:34:00,968 --> 01:34:03,869
- You don't have a choice.

1017
01:34:05,373 --> 01:34:07,341
I'll dig you out from your grave.

1018
01:34:12,146 --> 01:34:18,949
- Have mercy! You can have it all!

1019
01:34:19,153 --> 01:34:20,347
Shut the crap!

1020
01:34:37,071 --> 01:34:38,766
Useless dolts!
As soon as I'm away...

1021
01:34:38,839 --> 01:34:41,171
you guys start jerking off!

1022
01:34:44,045 --> 01:34:45,103
Tell me!

1023
01:34:45,179 --> 01:34:46,237
Chief, we were...

1024
01:34:46,313 --> 01:34:48,838
"Chief", "chief"... stop barking!

1025
01:34:51,886 --> 01:34:52,944
Grandma has given the nod!

1026
01:34:56,857 --> 01:35:00,054
Brother-in-law, can you believe it?

1027
01:35:00,461 --> 01:35:02,520
It wasn't easy getting her around.

1028
01:35:02,930 --> 01:35:04,864
She can be quite fickle...

1029
01:35:05,132 --> 01:35:07,430
so we've got to act quickly!

1030
01:35:07,535 --> 01:35:08,832
Go get the guitar!

1031
01:35:08,903 --> 01:35:10,097
- We'll take care of the wedding.

1032
01:35:10,404 --> 01:35:11,803
Start the arrangements right away...

1033
01:35:11,839 --> 01:35:15,070
contact the caterer...

1034
01:35:15,342 --> 01:35:18,800
and go tell grandma to make sweets.

1035
01:35:18,879 --> 01:35:20,346
We're having a feast tonight.

1036
01:35:21,982 --> 01:35:23,040
Why haven't you left?

1037
01:35:23,818 --> 01:35:29,279
You should get going...

1038
01:35:31,292 --> 01:35:33,954
What about the election now?

1039
01:35:35,162 --> 01:35:36,288
What about it?

1040
01:35:37,031 --> 01:35:39,397
I'll join the party
that backs your lot.

1041
01:35:40,101 --> 01:35:41,159
Brother-in-law...

1042
01:35:42,770 --> 01:35:46,035
politics is a business.

1043
01:35:47,408 --> 01:35:51,435
Power and family.
That's all that matters!

1044
01:36:03,791 --> 01:36:04,849
Done digging my grave?

1045
01:36:05,192 --> 01:36:06,784
Reporting from inside the coffin.

1046
01:36:08,963 --> 01:36:12,194
You got your ten lakhs.

1047
01:36:14,301 --> 01:36:16,428
- Deal. Take down the address.

1048
01:36:17,805 --> 01:36:19,329
I've sent the address and plan.

1049
01:36:20,307 --> 01:36:21,365
With whom?

1050
01:36:21,809 --> 01:36:22,867
- Police.

1051
01:36:24,311 --> 01:36:25,369
Should be on their way.

1052
01:36:59,180 --> 01:37:00,841
Look at that! Chief Tope...

1053
01:37:02,917 --> 01:37:05,044
sleeping like a baby!

1054
01:37:09,356 --> 01:37:12,519
Let's find the guitar.

1055
01:38:09,316 --> 01:38:10,374
- Daddy...

1056
01:38:23,330 --> 01:38:27,096
- Found the guitar?
- Still searching.

1057
01:38:27,935 --> 01:38:32,201
Beware! The lisper is
with the cops!

1058
01:38:32,439 --> 01:38:35,067
- They'll come around sniffing.
- Alright.

1059
01:38:37,144 --> 01:38:38,406
As soon as you find the stuff...

1060
01:38:38,879 --> 01:38:40,744
- shoot him off. - Sure.

1061
01:38:44,752 --> 01:38:45,810
What if we don't find it?

1062
01:38:46,053 --> 01:38:48,351
Then get your mom
hooked up with him!

1063
01:38:48,455 --> 01:38:50,480
- Why drag my poor mom into this?

1064
01:38:52,092 --> 01:38:53,855
- Hail Maharashtra!
- Hail Maharashtra!

1065
01:38:54,061 --> 01:38:55,119
- Hail Maharashtra!

1066
01:38:56,964 --> 01:38:58,022
- What are you doing here?

1067
01:38:59,066 --> 01:39:00,090
Listening.

1068
01:39:01,101 --> 01:39:02,159
Listening to what?

1069
01:39:08,142 --> 01:39:10,042
How about a chocolate?

1070
01:39:10,144 --> 01:39:11,941
No, I want a car!

1071
01:39:13,914 --> 01:39:17,509
My my! A car?

1072
01:39:19,787 --> 01:39:20,845
Keep this!

1073
01:39:21,155 --> 01:39:24,522
This won't even get me a bicycle.

1074
01:39:29,430 --> 01:39:30,488
Is this good enough?

1075
01:39:33,133 --> 01:39:34,225
- Remember, you heard nothing!

1076
01:39:34,435 --> 01:39:36,494
Now scram!

1077
01:39:50,851 --> 01:39:51,909
You shitface!

1078
01:39:53,420 --> 01:39:54,478
- You aren't dead yet?

1079
01:40:00,361 --> 01:40:04,024
- Now what do you want?
- You're alright?

1080
01:40:04,264 --> 01:40:07,495
The police let you go?

1081
01:40:07,768 --> 01:40:11,465
Disappointed to see me alive?

1082
01:40:13,240 --> 01:40:14,298
Arsehole!

1083
01:40:15,976 --> 01:40:18,137
You almost sacrificed me
for the girl.

1084
01:40:31,325 --> 01:40:33,885
We got married last night.

1085
01:40:37,464 --> 01:40:40,058
Now you want a wedding gift?

1086
01:40:43,937 --> 01:40:44,961
I need a loan.

1087
01:40:46,407 --> 01:40:47,874
Did the sun rise
from the west today?

1088
01:40:51,478 --> 01:40:53,173
Will my filthy money be...

1089
01:40:55,849 --> 01:40:56,907
good for you?

1090
01:41:02,423 --> 01:41:03,481
I don't want money...

1091
01:41:06,193 --> 01:41:07,353
I want the guitar case.

1092
01:41:10,364 --> 01:41:11,422
Come again?

1093
01:41:20,774 --> 01:41:22,207
I'll gouge your eyes out,
if you even look at it.

1094
01:41:23,777 --> 01:41:25,802
Sweety's life depends on it.

1095
01:41:25,913 --> 01:41:26,971
How sweet!

1096
01:41:28,148 --> 01:41:29,206
- She's pregnant.

1097
01:41:29,316 --> 01:41:31,045
I'm not responsible.

1098
01:41:32,453 --> 01:41:35,513
I will repay every penny.

1099
01:41:36,457 --> 01:41:39,324
Wasn't I d... dead for you?

1100
01:41:41,728 --> 01:41:42,786
Arsehole!

1101
01:41:42,863 --> 01:41:45,331
Remember, what you
swore on dad's pyre?

1102
01:41:45,766 --> 01:41:48,360
"l don't want to see your f...
f... face ever again."

1103
01:41:49,736 --> 01:41:51,431
Stop blaming yourself!

1104
01:41:57,077 --> 01:41:58,408
Bury the ghosts of the past.

1105
01:42:01,014 --> 01:42:02,106
Forgive yourself.

1106
01:42:06,487 --> 01:42:07,749
Whose ghosts?

1107
01:42:08,856 --> 01:42:09,914
Forgive myself for what?

1108
01:42:10,491 --> 01:42:12,789
Even if you got the money on time...

1109
01:42:13,794 --> 01:42:15,159
dad would've killed himself.

1110
01:42:16,864 --> 01:42:21,198
Neither of us are
responsible for his death.

1111
01:42:24,104 --> 01:42:26,197
But we are
responsible for our own lives.

1112
01:42:36,316 --> 01:42:39,774
Let me go or it'll be too late.

1113
01:42:47,361 --> 01:42:48,419
- Guddu!

1114
01:43:38,312 --> 01:43:39,973
Life is offering you
a second chance.

1115
01:43:43,717 --> 01:43:46,743
Don't walk away
from the right path.

1116
01:43:47,754 --> 01:43:48,812
I swear I'll shoot.

1117
01:44:22,155 --> 01:44:23,349
There was a time...

1118
01:44:25,058 --> 01:44:29,017
when we were inseparable.

1119
01:44:31,965 --> 01:44:33,796
- Daddy...

1120
01:44:40,040 --> 01:44:42,804
We were so happy.

1121
01:44:43,810 --> 01:44:46,870
He was both a mother
and father to us.

1122
01:44:48,782 --> 01:44:49,840
He was our hero.

1123
01:44:52,152 --> 01:44:53,210
A thief, he wasn't.

1124
01:44:54,988 --> 01:44:56,387
What made him steal the watch...

1125
01:44:56,823 --> 01:44:57,983
and for whom...

1126
01:44:58,425 --> 01:45:00,893
was beyond our understanding.

1127
01:45:10,904 --> 01:45:13,202
- Five thousand, nothing less.

1128
01:45:13,473 --> 01:45:16,067
- I've spoken with
the boss. Go get it.

1129
01:45:16,176 --> 01:45:17,336
- We'll let your father go.

1130
01:45:21,281 --> 01:45:26,913
They've asked for five,
I have three.

1131
01:45:27,087 --> 01:45:29,419
- How? - Scholarship...

1132
01:45:29,956 --> 01:45:31,821
- Where is it?
- The wa... wa...

1133
01:45:31,892 --> 01:45:33,154
- The watch tower? - Yes.

1134
01:45:33,260 --> 01:45:36,423
Stay with father,
I'll be back with five.

1135
01:46:14,835 --> 01:46:16,928
By the time l
returned with the money...

1136
01:46:18,004 --> 01:46:21,440
father had committed suicide.

1137
01:46:27,981 --> 01:46:29,881
And with his death...

1138
01:46:31,318 --> 01:46:34,549
we were brothers no more.

1139
01:46:36,356 --> 01:46:40,190
Open your mouth... ha ha ha!

1140
01:46:43,130 --> 01:46:45,792
- Daddy...

1141
01:47:31,878 --> 01:47:34,108
This is the voicemail
box of lnspector Lele.

1142
01:47:34,214 --> 01:47:35,806
Leave a message after the beep.

1143
01:47:35,916 --> 01:47:37,315
Hail Maharashtra, Hail lndia!

1144
01:47:38,919 --> 01:47:41,012
Mr Charlie... This
is lnspector Lele...

1145
01:47:41,121 --> 01:47:43,021
We've arranged for your ten lakhs.

1146
01:47:43,123 --> 01:47:46,183
Sir, where do we meet?

1147
01:47:46,827 --> 01:47:49,489
Sir, please call back when free.

1148
01:47:57,771 --> 01:47:59,238
Now can you call for a doctor?

1149
01:48:01,508 --> 01:48:04,875
- He'll bleed to death. - Kiddo...

1150
01:48:07,113 --> 01:48:09,172
- Try again. - Sir?

1151
01:48:10,150 --> 01:48:11,208
- Call!

1152
01:48:16,990 --> 01:48:18,457
And if he doesn't answer...

1153
01:48:20,126 --> 01:48:21,457
shoot yourself!

1154
01:48:37,477 --> 01:48:38,535
- Kiddo...

1155
01:48:39,112 --> 01:48:42,741
- We're screwed! For real!

1156
01:48:43,917 --> 01:48:46,078
- Enough is enough!
- What do you mean?

1157
01:48:46,753 --> 01:48:49,187
If you want you can call me,
when the stuff comes.

1158
01:48:49,489 --> 01:48:51,047
I'll be in lndia somewhere.

1159
01:48:52,292 --> 01:48:56,194
Tashi has everything under control.
You've got to trust me on this.

1160
01:48:56,296 --> 01:48:59,493
He is messing with us.
Can't you see?

1161
01:49:01,902 --> 01:49:06,965
Cajetan, if you walk through
that door, I'll shoot you.

1162
01:49:07,507 --> 01:49:09,498
This is the voicemail
box of lnspector Lele.

1163
01:49:09,876 --> 01:49:11,275
Leave a message after the beep.

1164
01:49:11,378 --> 01:49:12,868
Hail Maharashtra, Hail lndia!

1165
01:49:20,453 --> 01:49:21,511
Please...

1166
01:49:41,775 --> 01:49:48,112
I have given my blood
for the diamonds. Get it?

1167
01:49:58,959 --> 01:50:01,484
- Forgive me, brother.

1168
01:50:07,200 --> 01:50:09,100
- Now do I get another chance?

1169
01:50:24,517 --> 01:50:26,781
- The department suspects
these two...

1170
01:50:26,853 --> 01:50:29,788
are working for the underworld.

1171
01:50:44,971 --> 01:50:47,997
What can Life do

1172
01:50:48,074 --> 01:50:50,736
Now that I have fallen into its lot

1173
01:50:51,945 --> 01:50:54,743
With my incessant complaints

1174
01:50:55,281 --> 01:50:58,011
Day in and day out

1175
01:51:01,488 --> 01:51:08,451
My desires are mean

1176
01:51:11,765 --> 01:51:18,762
Mean are my dreams too

1177
01:51:21,508 --> 01:51:27,777
A little rapport I had
struck with the heart

1178
01:51:28,281 --> 01:51:33,878
That monsieur too
turned out to be mean

1179
01:51:35,522 --> 01:51:38,514
What can Life do

1180
01:51:38,958 --> 01:51:42,155
Now that I have fallen into its lot

1181
01:51:42,262 --> 01:51:45,459
With my incessant complaints

1182
01:51:45,832 --> 01:51:51,031
Day in and day out

1183
01:51:55,041 --> 01:51:57,339
Sweety, have you lost it!

1184
01:51:58,111 --> 01:51:59,476
- Guddu must be on his way back...

1185
01:52:00,080 --> 01:52:02,048
put the gun down.

1186
01:52:02,148 --> 01:52:04,082
You're a swine!

1187
01:52:04,784 --> 01:52:06,752
I know what you told
Ganesh over the phone.

1188
01:52:11,357 --> 01:52:14,952
You're misunderstanding me. I swear!

1189
01:52:15,762 --> 01:52:16,820
Go on...

1190
01:52:16,930 --> 01:52:17,988
go get her!

1191
01:52:22,802 --> 01:52:25,362
- We'll be able to hear each other.

1192
01:52:25,972 --> 01:52:28,873
Don't do anything,
until I instruct you.

1193
01:52:30,176 --> 01:52:31,234
Remember...

1194
01:52:31,511 --> 01:52:33,877
we have to catch Bhope red handed.

1195
01:52:34,114 --> 01:52:35,172
- Wear this.

1196
01:52:37,417 --> 01:52:40,944
- I'll kill you... - Me?
You'll kill me?

1197
01:52:41,387 --> 01:52:42,445
- Go ahead!

1198
01:52:44,357 --> 01:52:48,020
You were this little
when mother passed away.

1199
01:52:48,394 --> 01:52:52,353
- Just like a small kitten.

1200
01:52:53,733 --> 01:52:56,725
Shoot me and then you can leave.

1201
01:52:56,836 --> 01:52:57,860
- Let's see what you've got.

1202
01:53:08,248 --> 01:53:12,014
- Guddu... - Now go... go on...

1203
01:53:13,753 --> 01:53:14,811
So...

1204
01:53:15,388 --> 01:53:19,017
- should I blow up his skull?

1205
01:53:19,425 --> 01:53:22,189
- Lower the gun!

1206
01:53:32,472 --> 01:53:35,134
Sunil Shekhar Bhope.

1207
01:53:37,877 --> 01:53:38,866
Bhope...

1208
01:53:43,449 --> 01:53:45,246
Afghani, stay with the Africans.

1209
01:53:47,754 --> 01:53:50,348
Grandpa! Where is Bhope?

1210
01:53:50,456 --> 01:53:54,324
He's in the courtyard. Screwed...
big time!

1211
01:53:57,096 --> 01:53:58,859
Lower the gun... please!

1212
01:53:58,965 --> 01:54:01,263
Why don't you tell
her to lower the gun?

1213
01:54:01,367 --> 01:54:02,732
- Let me be. - He's saying...

1214
01:54:02,836 --> 01:54:04,326
G... gun... Iower the gun.

1215
01:54:05,138 --> 01:54:07,368
Hand over the guitar, quickly!

1216
01:54:07,440 --> 01:54:09,738
- The stuff... - Screw the stuff!

1217
01:54:09,809 --> 01:54:11,743
Talk some sense into her!

1218
01:54:12,879 --> 01:54:14,278
Lower the g... gun...

1219
01:54:14,781 --> 01:54:15,839
I'm absolutely fine.

1220
01:54:16,316 --> 01:54:17,374
- Bhope...

1221
01:54:23,790 --> 01:54:24,848
You'll shoot me?

1222
01:54:34,901 --> 01:54:37,369
You actually shot me?

1223
01:54:38,004 --> 01:54:39,096
How dare you?

1224
01:54:44,444 --> 01:54:45,502
Get lost!

1225
01:54:45,845 --> 01:54:46,903
Get lost!

1226
01:54:51,184 --> 01:54:52,913
- chief... here...

1227
01:54:54,787 --> 01:54:55,845
- chief...

1228
01:55:08,034 --> 01:55:11,003
- Relax, Bhope... take it easy.

1229
01:55:13,406 --> 01:55:14,464
Who the hell are you?

1230
01:55:17,377 --> 01:55:18,901
Even we've got guns.

1231
01:55:19,812 --> 01:55:20,870
Big ones!

1232
01:55:21,281 --> 01:55:23,112
- But who wants a war?

1233
01:55:24,484 --> 01:55:25,542
I'm not America.

1234
01:55:25,919 --> 01:55:28,251
This is Maharashtra!

1235
01:55:30,957 --> 01:55:33,448
- Who the hell are you?
- Me? I'm Tashi.

1236
01:55:33,860 --> 01:55:34,918
Tashi, the Great!

1237
01:55:50,209 --> 01:55:53,508
I don't believe this! You're alive.

1238
01:55:54,781 --> 01:55:55,839
You guys...

1239
01:55:56,783 --> 01:56:00,184
- move the guitar. Move it!

1240
01:56:06,826 --> 01:56:09,989
- Tashi! A tiger in a mousetrap!

1241
01:56:10,229 --> 01:56:12,993
- Call headquarters for
reinforcements. - Copy Sir.

1242
01:56:13,433 --> 01:56:15,128
Headquarter come in,
this is Tigerhead.

1243
01:56:18,404 --> 01:56:20,998
- Team One is moving in.
We need back-up.

1244
01:56:23,176 --> 01:56:25,406
- Guddu, we're coming in,
don't panic.

1245
01:56:25,478 --> 01:56:26,536
- It's going to be okay.

1246
01:56:38,458 --> 01:56:40,016
Granted you have the stuff.

1247
01:56:41,894 --> 01:56:45,386
How do you plan to
sell it and to whom?

1248
01:56:46,799 --> 01:56:49,768
- Ultimately the
guitar will come back to me!

1249
01:56:52,238 --> 01:56:56,800
How much for your charity fund?

1250
01:57:07,053 --> 01:57:09,317
Ten crores! Cash!

1251
01:57:11,524 --> 01:57:12,889
In Dollars or Euros?

1252
01:57:18,831 --> 01:57:20,799
- You freaking dirty rat!

1253
01:57:21,334 --> 01:57:26,067
- This is the Anti-Narcotics
Cell of the Mumbai police!

1254
01:57:26,172 --> 01:57:27,230
- Surrender your guns!

1255
01:57:27,473 --> 01:57:29,464
- This is the Anti-Narcotics
Cell of the Mumbai police!

1256
01:57:29,876 --> 01:57:31,070
- Surrender your guns!

1257
01:57:31,244 --> 01:57:33,974
- Don't move or I'll shoot!

1258
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:36,071
I'll kill your spy.

1259
01:57:37,183 --> 01:57:39,743
- If he is hurt,
nobody will be spared.

1260
01:57:39,819 --> 01:57:41,946
- Surrender yourselves!

1261
01:57:42,088 --> 01:57:44,022
- You have no option.

1262
01:57:51,164 --> 01:57:52,893
There is an option.

1263
01:57:52,999 --> 01:57:59,131
Hey Pele... Tell him your plan!

1264
01:58:01,140 --> 01:58:04,109
- I'm Lele, not Pele! - Whatever!

1265
01:58:04,777 --> 01:58:08,213
Tell the lnspector, he gets 33%.

1266
01:58:10,450 --> 01:58:13,283
Prateek... it's me lnspector Lele.

1267
01:58:13,386 --> 01:58:15,980
What you doing up there? Come down.

1268
01:58:16,089 --> 01:58:17,351
The stuff is worth ten crores.

1269
01:58:17,423 --> 01:58:20,415
3,33,33,333.33... all ours!

1270
01:58:20,493 --> 01:58:22,518
- All yours! - And there's
no Lobo to share it with.

1271
01:58:22,795 --> 01:58:24,319
- Come down.

1272
01:58:24,464 --> 01:58:25,522
Hold your fire.

1273
01:58:31,804 --> 01:58:34,796
- What the hell is this?
- Shut up, Cajetan!

1274
01:58:34,907 --> 01:58:36,397
Tashi, he is right!

1275
01:58:36,476 --> 01:58:38,467
Shut the hell up... shut up!

1276
01:58:38,811 --> 01:58:42,474
Last and final, 60, 20, 20.

1277
01:58:42,849 --> 01:58:46,012
- Or you can shoot! - Shoot?

1278
01:58:46,319 --> 01:58:47,377
- Go on shoot!

1279
01:58:48,387 --> 01:58:50,378
Shoot and I'll burn the stuff!

1280
01:58:50,756 --> 01:58:52,383
Hold your fire!

1281
01:58:54,760 --> 01:58:57,024
Charlie boy... great job!

1282
01:58:57,096 --> 01:58:58,154
Fourth partner!

1283
01:58:58,431 --> 01:59:01,764
- 25% each!

1284
01:59:02,101 --> 01:59:04,467
- Now come down.

1285
01:59:04,871 --> 01:59:06,133
Hey... knucklehead!

1286
01:59:07,039 --> 01:59:09,371
I didn't risk it all for the money.

1287
01:59:10,143 --> 01:59:13,306
I did it for this stupid Romeo!

1288
01:59:14,347 --> 01:59:16,781
He doesn't know this
world is a bitch...

1289
01:59:16,883 --> 01:59:19,044
and how rotten you dogs really are!

1290
01:59:19,285 --> 01:59:20,343
Let him go!

1291
01:59:20,953 --> 01:59:22,420
- Her as well.

1292
01:59:25,458 --> 01:59:27,517
Take your Juliet along and run!

1293
01:59:28,060 --> 01:59:29,118
And you?

1294
01:59:29,228 --> 01:59:32,527
You'll kill me with all your love!

1295
01:59:34,333 --> 01:59:35,425
- Get moving!

1296
01:59:36,435 --> 01:59:39,165
At least for the baby's sake.

1297
01:59:39,272 --> 01:59:40,330
- Guddu, move it!

1298
01:59:41,874 --> 01:59:48,040
- Come down with the guitar!

1299
01:59:48,214 --> 01:59:49,738
Drop your gun!

1300
02:00:46,939 --> 02:00:50,067
This path that you bargained for

1301
02:00:50,743 --> 02:00:52,335
Will stay deserted

1302
02:01:00,886 --> 02:01:04,049
The noose of life

1303
02:01:04,423 --> 02:01:06,482
Does never snap

1304
02:01:30,783 --> 02:01:34,446
Who walk the edge of swords

1305
02:01:34,520 --> 02:01:38,479
will unfailingly get hurt

1306
02:01:40,793 --> 02:01:44,126
The noose snared around your neck

1307
02:01:44,196 --> 02:01:47,962
only tightens, does not snap

1308
02:01:48,367 --> 02:01:50,358
The color of blood

1309
02:01:50,436 --> 02:01:52,097
However sanguine

1310
02:01:52,171 --> 02:01:54,799
Fails to color life

1311
02:02:02,381 --> 02:02:06,010
The noose of life

1312
02:02:06,252 --> 02:02:08,345
Does never snap

1313
02:02:39,785 --> 02:02:41,810
- Hail Maharashtra!

1314
02:02:51,964 --> 02:03:01,839
The sliver of time
between two breaths is too fine

1315
02:03:01,941 --> 02:03:03,465
Life is offering you
a second chance.

1316
02:03:03,876 --> 02:03:06,037
Don't walk away
from the right path.

1317
02:03:06,345 --> 02:03:10,179
My past sneaks into the future

1318
02:03:10,750 --> 02:03:15,744
and robs it off all hope

1319
02:03:21,994 --> 02:03:31,369
Rivers of blood never
find themselves an ocean

1320
02:04:09,809 --> 02:04:12,471
- I told you, didn't l?
You'd have twins!

1321
02:04:16,248 --> 02:04:18,739
If you bet against me,
you'll always lose.

1322
02:04:19,819 --> 02:04:20,877
Now tell me...

1323
02:04:22,221 --> 02:04:23,279
whom do they look like?

1324
02:04:26,492 --> 02:04:27,857
How sweet!

1325
02:04:39,238 --> 02:04:40,967
One diamond adorns her finger...

1326
02:04:42,308 --> 02:04:43,866
while she is a gem herself!

1327
02:04:44,910 --> 02:04:48,368
Sophia is her name and...

1328
02:04:48,781 --> 02:04:51,079
she doesn't pronounce S as F!

1329
02:05:18,477 --> 02:05:22,538
I don't even have clothes to wear.

1330
02:05:23,849 --> 02:05:30,152
It's alright, I prefer
