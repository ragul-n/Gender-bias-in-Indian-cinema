1
00:00:01,134 --> 00:00:02,112
Yudi...

2
00:02:32,251 --> 00:02:33,229
Yudi...

3
00:02:36,355 --> 00:02:37,390
You know...

4
00:02:38,724 --> 00:02:40,203
No!

5
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:43,835
Yudi, I love you.

6
00:02:43,896 --> 00:02:45,170
Oh!

7
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:57,312
I love you.

8
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:07,791
Huh“?

9
00:03:22,501 --> 00:03:24,447
Done?

10
00:03:25,771 --> 00:03:29,275
I said "I love you".
What do you have to say?

11
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:33,281
Cool“?

12
00:03:38,784 --> 00:03:41,424
Baby, wait. Sweety!

13
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:43,796
Come on...

14
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:46,501
Please don't complicate
the situation...

15
00:03:46,558 --> 00:03:48,697
I'm complicating the situation?!

16
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:51,173
Where is this relationship
heading, Yudi?

17
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:52,834
Why does it have to head anywhere?

18
00:03:52,898 --> 00:03:55,378
I mean... wherever it is, it is fine!

19
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:56,510
No?

20
00:03:56,568 --> 00:03:59,105
But...l thought you love me.

21
00:03:59,171 --> 00:04:02,744
I do love... your vibes...

22
00:04:02,808 --> 00:04:04,754
Your... face...

23
00:04:05,077 --> 00:04:07,182
Your... energy...

24
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,656
I'm not getting it now,
but a whole lot of things about you!

25
00:04:11,717 --> 00:04:13,128
I do.

26
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,762
Yudi, why do you
always run from love?

27
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:19,329
I know you feel something inside.

28
00:04:19,391 --> 00:04:22,600
I... I just know there's
more depth to you.

29
00:04:24,296 --> 00:04:26,333
Actually, that's not true.

30
00:04:26,398 --> 00:04:28,810
What you see is what it isl

31
00:04:28,867 --> 00:04:31,541
There's no depth
and stuff to me... maybe.

32
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:34,307
I don't think so.

33
00:04:34,606 --> 00:04:36,085
Sorry!

34
00:04:46,118 --> 00:04:47,461
Idiot.

35
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,461
We can still be friends...

36
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:01,670
All men are dogs. It's true.

37
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:03,736
And, there are two types of dogs.

38
00:05:03,802 --> 00:05:05,748
One, the pet dog,

39
00:05:05,804 --> 00:05:09,616
Which lives and dies, eating home food
and riding in the backseat of the car!

40
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:13,590
Two, the stray dog,

41
00:05:13,645 --> 00:05:15,386
Which has no home or address,

42
00:05:15,447 --> 00:05:18,223
eats what it wants,
sleeps where it likes..

43
00:05:18,283 --> 00:05:19,489
The whole city is its home!

44
00:05:19,551 --> 00:05:23,499
But the problem is,
we spend half our lives...

45
00:05:23,555 --> 00:05:25,364
<i>...</i> figuring out which type we are!

46
00:05:30,362 --> 00:05:31,739
Yudi...

47
00:05:31,797 --> 00:05:33,140
You know...

48
00:05:35,267 --> 00:05:37,076
I love you.

49
00:05:39,805 --> 00:05:41,182
Umm...

50
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:45,654
Jerk!

51
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:47,789
Okay, fine. Me too.

52
00:05:47,846 --> 00:05:49,792
Me tool
- "Me too" what?

53
00:05:50,215 --> 00:05:51,523
Me too...

54
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:53,694
Okay, fine. Just go.

55
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:01,599
I don't have a problem
with "I Love You".

56
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:04,334
It's with the baggage
that comes with it!

57
00:06:04,596 --> 00:06:08,043
99% of stories end at "I Love You".

58
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:09,512
Do you know why?

59
00:06:09,568 --> 00:06:11,104
It's the beginning of the end!

60
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,774
It destroys everything.

61
00:06:13,105 --> 00:06:14,743
It all goes to crab.

62
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:17,151
Love looks nice only in movies.

63
00:06:17,209 --> 00:06:18,654
The edit out the extra parts.

64
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:21,486
And only show comedy, romance, songs.

65
00:06:21,847 --> 00:06:23,724
The hero kisses the heroine.

66
00:06:23,782 --> 00:06:25,420
And what happens next?

67
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:27,596
Happy Ending?

68
00:06:49,274 --> 00:06:50,309
Hey?

69
00:06:53,278 --> 00:06:54,450
Is that you?

70
00:08:45,123 --> 00:08:46,761
I love you.

71
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:44,218
Is there a happy ending in life?

72
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:46,092
If there's one,
then when does it happen?

73
00:09:46,151 --> 00:09:48,688
After love?
After marriage? After children?

74
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:49,732
After divorce?

75
00:09:49,788 --> 00:09:51,233
After death?

76
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:53,568
Is death a happy ending at all?I

77
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:57,105
Actually, there no
happy endings in life!

78
00:09:58,297 --> 00:10:00,368
There no
happy endings in life!

79
00:10:05,704 --> 00:10:07,581
We'll down two Yeager bombs each“

80
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:09,744
then order an entire pitcher
and settle down.

81
00:10:09,808 --> 00:10:11,344
Next we go to Edison.

82
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,617
Bucket of Chicken ...and
we start the real drinking...

83
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:15,215
Then you'll vomit your guts out...

84
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,784
and I'll deliver your body lo your
home and apologise lo your wife...

85
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:19,658
Correct?

86
00:10:19,718 --> 00:10:21,254
Don't kill my buzz, brah!

87
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,594
I rarely get a chance to get out!

88
00:10:22,654 --> 00:10:24,827
Did you get permission from Gauri?

89
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,699
The application is in process.

90
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:29,698
Montu, what's taking
so long in there?!

91
00:10:29,761 --> 00:10:31,502
Baby, I've a bit of a problem today...

92
00:10:31,563 --> 00:10:33,565
Montu, don't lie.
You're on the phone, aren't you?

93
00:10:33,632 --> 00:10:34,804
Come, look for yourself I

94
00:10:34,866 --> 00:10:38,143
What look for yourself?I Come out
fast. You are in there since an hour.

95
00:10:38,203 --> 00:10:41,207
Listen... we'll discuss
the rest when we meet.

96
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:43,082
Hold on, Montu,
I am getting another call.

97
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:46,482
Oh!

98
00:10:47,379 --> 00:10:48,380
It's Vishakha!

99
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:51,155
Why is Vishakha calling you?
I thought you two broke up?

100
00:10:51,216 --> 00:10:52,194
Well“

101
00:10:52,517 --> 00:10:55,657
Yudi... cutie... I love you.

102
00:10:57,656 --> 00:10:59,135
Oh!

103
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:00,101
Cutie...

104
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:03,365
Oh, you don't have to say anything.

105
00:11:03,428 --> 00:11:06,238
I know you love me too.

106
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,805
I can see deep inside you, baby!

107
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:16,250
So she doesn't know
you've broken up with her?I

108
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:18,151
She thinks you're still together!

109
00:11:19,778 --> 00:11:22,622
You're gonna die trying
to run away from her!

110
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:25,321
Montu, will you come out
or should I come in?I

111
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:27,220
Okay, don't-kill-my-plan-don't-be-late.

112
00:11:27,285 --> 00:11:28,320
Okay, bye.

113
00:11:33,892 --> 00:11:35,769
Hi, Yudi... Cutie!

114
00:11:35,827 --> 00:11:37,704
Hey, Vishakha.

115
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:39,265
Where are you?

116
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:41,338
I'm... at home...

117
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,811
Perfect! I am coming.

118
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:44,805
Why?I

119
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:46,615
To meet you!

120
00:11:46,671 --> 00:11:49,811
Vishakha,
I have an important meeting today.

121
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,151
This is not a good time for me.
Can we meet tomorrow?

122
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:54,816
Wait for five minutes.
- Five minutes?

123
00:11:55,213 --> 00:11:56,556
I am almost there!

124
00:11:57,482 --> 00:11:58,620
Cutiepie.

125
00:11:58,683 --> 00:12:00,094
Hello.
- Hi.

126
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:01,529
I am leaving now, I am very late.

127
00:12:01,586 --> 00:12:03,190
Call me later.

128
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:05,166
I've reached!
- I've left!

129
00:12:05,223 --> 00:12:07,430
But your car's still here.
- I am taking my cycle.

130
00:12:07,492 --> 00:12:10,132
What? You're riding
a cycle to your meeting?

131
00:12:10,195 --> 00:12:11,435
What kind of a meeting is this?

132
00:12:11,496 --> 00:12:13,373
Hold on for a sec, please.

133
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:16,672
Yudi...

134
00:12:19,204 --> 00:12:20,148
Hey, kid...

135
00:12:29,214 --> 00:12:32,491
Baby, I need to ask your
permission ten times to go out once!

136
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:34,792
I think you love Yudi more than me.

137
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,497
Baby, please don't start that again.

138
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:38,535
Why don't you go out
with your friends too?

139
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:39,762
I don't have any friends.

140
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:41,805
Then... that's not my fault, is it?

141
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,136
No.
You go... party hard...

142
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:45,834
I'll manage all the chores
around the house!

143
00:12:46,164 --> 00:12:47,837
What's left to do?
- Did you pay the mortgage?

144
00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:49,845
Yes.
- Cable bill? Mobile bill?

145
00:12:49,901 --> 00:12:51,278
Done. And done!

146
00:12:51,336 --> 00:12:52,713
Car servicing?
- Yes.

147
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:55,718
I knew it, otherwise I would've
never even thought of going out!

148
00:12:56,508 --> 00:12:58,385
And the shelf?
- Huh?

149
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:06,389
Can I do it tomorrow? Please.

150
00:13:06,451 --> 00:13:07,361
Promise!

151
00:13:11,156 --> 00:13:14,069
Baby, that's done too. It's all done!

152
00:13:16,294 --> 00:13:17,364
Hold on.

153
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:37,316
Hello.
- Hi Montu.

154
00:13:37,582 --> 00:13:39,653
Yes, Yudi.
- Are you coming or not?

155
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:41,197
No, I can't come. Sorry.

156
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:42,561
You know...l am really busy.

157
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:44,123
No problem, Montu.

158
00:13:44,189 --> 00:13:46,499
No, don't force me please.
It's no use.

159
00:13:46,558 --> 00:13:48,765
No worries! Just chill. Bye.

160
00:13:49,394 --> 00:13:51,499
You go have fun! Alone! Okay?

161
00:13:51,563 --> 00:13:53,565
Without me. Bye.

162
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:56,177
Okay. Bye!

163
00:13:56,234 --> 00:13:58,805
Poor guy was in tears!
- Cut the drama! And go.

164
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:00,240
Huh?

165
00:14:00,305 --> 00:14:04,219
No, no. What will you
do alone at home? - Just go.

166
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:09,515
No, I'll fix this and then“
- I said, go!

167
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:12,225
Okay-thanks-l-love-you-bye!

168
00:14:17,689 --> 00:14:20,795
See this beer mug. This is my wife.

169
00:14:21,359 --> 00:14:25,705
And all these drinks... are the
rest of the girls in the world!

170
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:27,437
And this?
- Peanuts?

171
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:29,570
Pea?!
- Nuts! Peanuts!

172
00:14:29,634 --> 00:14:30,612
Oh Peanuts!

173
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:35,175
I left all these girls...
and married this beer mug!

174
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,277
Do you realize how
big a sacrifice this is?I

175
00:14:37,342 --> 00:14:39,117
How huge a commitment?!
- Thanks.

176
00:14:39,177 --> 00:14:41,179
But see, Montu. These are all empty!

177
00:14:41,246 --> 00:14:42,281
And your wife's so full!

178
00:14:42,347 --> 00:14:43,690
Hey...that's my wife
you're talking about!

179
00:14:43,748 --> 00:14:44,818
She's like my sister.

180
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,788
You know, I'm really jealous of you.
- Why?

181
00:14:47,118 --> 00:14:48,791
<i>6</i> years ago you wrote one book.

182
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,758
And thanks to that,
you're picking up chicks to this day!

183
00:14:50,822 --> 00:14:51,800
51!2, okay?

184
00:14:51,856 --> 00:14:54,700
And what do you think,
I get girls because of a book?I

185
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:57,467
Of course.
You're no stud! - Whatever, dude.

186
00:14:57,529 --> 00:14:59,839
Tell me something, why aren't
you writing your next book?

187
00:14:59,898 --> 00:15:01,775
Why should I put the effort?

188
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,075
What does one want in life?

189
00:15:04,135 --> 00:15:07,582
Fame, money, girls!
I have everything.

190
00:15:08,139 --> 00:15:10,312
What's the point of
forcing myself to work?

191
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:11,615
Wow!

192
00:15:11,676 --> 00:15:13,383
You're so clear about your life!

193
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:15,721
We've wasted enough time already.

194
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:18,386
I have to party hard,
and drink harder!

195
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,521
Montu, don't be hectic dude.

196
00:15:28,693 --> 00:15:31,105
<i>Come on, Mound'</i>

197
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,318
Montu, that's enough.

198
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:51,690
Let's go, please.

199
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:54,390
We still got time, bro.
Keep dancing, keep moving.

200
00:15:54,452 --> 00:15:57,524
It's closing time.
The lights are on.

201
00:15:57,589 --> 00:15:59,830
Just open and close
your eyes repeatedly...

202
00:15:59,891 --> 00:16:01,097
You'll feel like you're in a disco.

203
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:02,160
Come on, get up.

204
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:04,571
Gentlemen, if you can exit
towards the rear. Bar's closed.

205
00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:05,300
Absolutely!

206
00:16:05,363 --> 00:16:06,433
Come on, Montu. Let's go.

207
00:16:06,798 --> 00:16:08,436
Montu, stop dancing around him...

208
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,410
Sir, let's go.

209
00:16:09,467 --> 00:16:10,605
Come on. Come on.

210
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:12,671
Come on.
Okay. Okay.

211
00:16:13,838 --> 00:16:17,047
Gross, Montu.

212
00:16:19,277 --> 00:16:22,781
Hey Yudi, I can see a French fry here.
Get some ketchup!

213
00:16:23,114 --> 00:16:24,184
Buzz off, Montu!

214
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:25,489
Yudi... Yudi!

215
00:17:03,521 --> 00:17:05,364
Hey! That's my car!

216
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:08,330
<i>Knew'</i>

217
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:10,568
What are you doing?
- Hey, is this your car?

218
00:17:10,628 --> 00:17:11,402
Yes.

219
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:13,136
Look, you haven't made
any instalment payments“

220
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,199
...in the past <i>6</i> months.

221
00:17:14,265 --> 00:17:15,335
And we're seizing your car.

222
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,643
What? You can't do that.
- You got questions, call this number.

223
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:22,142
Looks like it's been
re-possessed by...Rack Publishing!

224
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,619
For failure to honour your contract.

225
00:17:26,144 --> 00:17:27,487
Sorry, man.

226
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:31,458
Hey, watch the...

227
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:46,434
For our newest best-selling author.

228
00:17:46,464 --> 00:17:48,307
Aanchal Reddy.

229
00:17:48,399 --> 00:17:50,675
Thank you.
- Congratulations.

230
00:17:54,806 --> 00:17:56,376
Nice to meet you.

231
00:17:57,509 --> 00:18:00,046
Sir... Sir, you cannot go in there.

232
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,531
Excuse me for a second.

233
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:17,740
I am really sorry, Yudi.
- Bastard!

234
00:18:18,062 --> 00:18:19,700
It's been 2 years since
you took an advance“

235
00:18:19,764 --> 00:18:20,742
...from the publishers.

236
00:18:21,065 --> 00:18:22,635
And you haven't written a word.

237
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,509
Thank God they took your car,
not your house!

238
00:18:24,569 --> 00:18:27,072
I'll return their goddamn money!

239
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:29,446
What's wrong? No money in the bank?

240
00:18:30,074 --> 00:18:32,111
Fine, let's break some funds.

241
00:18:33,111 --> 00:18:34,385
No funds either?

242
00:18:35,113 --> 00:18:36,353
Nothing?

243
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:40,356
Look, you WERE a successful author.

244
00:18:40,618 --> 00:18:42,757
But your last book
released <i>6</i> years ago.

245
00:18:43,087 --> 00:18:44,794
5 'A.
- Correct, 5 'Al

246
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:47,067
Royalties stopped 1 'A years ago.

247
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:48,763
Your books are no longer in stores.

248
00:18:49,093 --> 00:18:51,300
Balls! It's available at
the bookstore close to my house.

249
00:18:51,362 --> 00:18:52,500
Why would they keep
it if it doesn't sell?

250
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:53,599
I had them kept there..

251
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:55,770
Just to make you happy-
- What?

252
00:18:57,435 --> 00:18:58,641
Oh wow!

253
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,410
Take care.

254
00:19:02,473 --> 00:19:04,680
Thank you.
It was nice meeting you all.

255
00:19:06,377 --> 00:19:07,378


256
00:19:13,117 --> 00:19:15,324
Who is she?
- Your doom!

257
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:20,594
Rack Publishing signed her after
cancelling your contract. - What?

258
00:19:20,658 --> 00:19:22,535
They've given her a 3-book deal.
- What?

259
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:25,234
And they're also paying
her double. - What?

260
00:19:25,296 --> 00:19:27,435
Why are you on repeat-mode?

261
00:19:27,832 --> 00:19:29,277
But how? Why?

262
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,712
She's smart. Writes well.

263
00:19:31,769 --> 00:19:33,544
Maybe... even better than you.

264
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:35,516
And she doesn't have your attitude.

265
00:19:35,573 --> 00:19:38,782
Plus, she writes romantic novels,
which always sells.

266
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:41,522
She got the contract because of you.

267
00:19:41,579 --> 00:19:43,320
You made her.

268
00:19:44,182 --> 00:19:47,095
I hope you're happy... with your fame,
money and booze!

269
00:19:47,151 --> 00:19:48,221
Girls!
- What?

270
00:19:48,286 --> 00:19:50,266
Fame, money and girls!

271
00:19:50,321 --> 00:19:52,301
Not booze, I am not Devdas!

272
00:19:53,324 --> 00:19:54,667
What now?

273
00:19:56,227 --> 00:19:57,297
Read this.

274
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,266
You might learn something.

275
00:20:00,331 --> 00:20:01,674
Crazy Hearts!

276
00:20:03,201 --> 00:20:04,612
Crazy Farts!

277
00:20:39,604 --> 00:20:40,412
What?

278
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,583
Really?
- Yeah!

279
00:20:43,641 --> 00:20:46,212
When? How?
- What do you mean, how?

280
00:20:47,178 --> 00:20:49,283
Are you sure?
- Are you serious?!

281
00:20:49,347 --> 00:20:52,157
I was traveling all of February.

282
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:54,557
Then how... is it possible?

283
00:20:54,619 --> 00:20:57,600
Didn't you come down
one Thursday for that meeting?

284
00:20:57,655 --> 00:21:01,102
But we don't do it on weekdays.
- We did it that day.

285
00:21:03,127 --> 00:21:05,198
Correct... shit

286
00:21:05,263 --> 00:21:08,733
I mean... so sweet!
Baby, come here.

287
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:11,078
Baby?

288
00:21:11,769 --> 00:21:13,043
Baby, what happened?

289
00:21:13,638 --> 00:21:14,776
Baby, what happened?

290
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:17,084
Baby, I am actually really happy!

291
00:21:17,675 --> 00:21:20,349
It's wonderful news. Superb news.

292
00:21:20,411 --> 00:21:23,517
Yay! I am going to be a father!

293
00:21:24,115 --> 00:21:25,287
<i>Paw'!</i>

294
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:32,702
Life was such a party.

295
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:35,634
What happened all of a sudden?!

296
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:39,365
Downfall is always sudden!

297
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:47,516
Are you going to cry?
- What? No.

298
00:21:48,306 --> 00:21:49,307
Good.

299
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:52,480
But we need money.
We need to do something.

300
00:21:52,543 --> 00:21:54,750
Not us, you...l

301
00:21:56,147 --> 00:21:57,285
Thanks.

302
00:21:58,649 --> 00:22:00,629
Hey Yogi, sit with me.

303
00:22:01,152 --> 00:22:02,130
Talk to me.

304
00:22:02,186 --> 00:22:03,324
About what?

305
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:04,765
About life.

306
00:22:07,725 --> 00:22:09,227
I'm busy.

307
00:22:22,106 --> 00:22:23,449
Don't do it.

308
00:22:24,809 --> 00:22:28,188
What?
- Don't call Divya.

309
00:22:28,546 --> 00:22:29,422
Why?

310
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:33,690
Look... men go crazy
between 12 and 4 am.

311
00:22:34,719 --> 00:22:37,393
They over-commit, get sentimental.

312
00:22:37,455 --> 00:22:38,559
Cry and weep.

313
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:40,102
And settle for anyone.

314
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:44,664
Basically,
they start thinking from their pants.

315
00:22:46,397 --> 00:22:50,470
Then comes morning,
and they come to their senses.

316
00:22:51,469 --> 00:22:53,540
Next comes remorse.

317
00:22:54,205 --> 00:22:58,312
That they are in more
trouble now than when they started!

318
00:22:58,576 --> 00:23:03,355
But it's Divya!
- She's your ex, and married.

319
00:23:04,115 --> 00:23:05,423
She has three kids.

320
00:23:05,483 --> 00:23:08,726
Actually, they are triplets.
So, counts as one.

321
00:23:09,253 --> 00:23:10,561
See, Yudi.

322
00:23:11,155 --> 00:23:13,658
You will do what you want to do.

323
00:23:14,792 --> 00:23:16,237
My advice...

324
00:23:18,262 --> 00:23:19,502
...is don't do.

325
00:23:27,171 --> 00:23:28,241
Hello.
- Hi.

326
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:30,809
Yudi?
- Are you sleeping?

327
00:23:32,777 --> 00:23:35,656
It's 2 am.
- Can you open the door, please?

328
00:23:35,713 --> 00:23:36,748
What?

329
00:23:37,648 --> 00:23:39,059
You're kidding me.

330
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:45,458
What are you doing here in
the middle of the night?

331
00:23:45,523 --> 00:23:47,161
I'm in a mess.

332
00:23:47,558 --> 00:23:49,196
I'm broke.

333
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,102
Oh!

334
00:23:50,628 --> 00:23:52,107
You need money?

335
00:23:52,163 --> 00:23:54,700
No...l just wanted to
talk to someone.

336
00:23:54,765 --> 00:23:56,608
Where's that girlfriend of yours?

337
00:23:58,136 --> 00:23:59,615
It's a bit complicated.

338
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:05,746
I mean, I've broken up with her.
But I don't think she's understood.

339
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:09,053
Did you tell her clearly
or is it all just in your head?

340
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:11,560
I've given her few hints.

341
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:14,787
Some things never change.

342
00:24:15,219 --> 00:24:18,223
If I tell her directly,
it will break her heart.

343
00:24:18,289 --> 00:24:20,792
What a thoughtful jerk.

344
00:24:22,593 --> 00:24:24,800
You know what your problem is?

345
00:24:25,096 --> 00:24:27,167
You love the fun that
comes with romance“

346
00:24:27,231 --> 00:24:29,268
...but not the responsibility
that comes with commitment.

347
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:30,744
What's so wrong with that?

348
00:24:30,801 --> 00:24:33,782
I mean all relationships are
fun and exciting in the beginning.

349
00:24:33,838 --> 00:24:36,546
Later, the mystery's dead
once you know each other.

350
00:24:36,607 --> 00:24:38,280
And all the excitement
and romance disappear.

351
00:24:38,342 --> 00:24:42,347
We covet commitment so much
that we ruin what we have.

352
00:24:42,413 --> 00:24:43,517
And what remains?

353
00:24:43,581 --> 00:24:45,788
Fights, battles,
family, her mother's birthday“

354
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:47,761
...his uncle's anniversary,
baby showers..

355
00:24:47,818 --> 00:24:49,764
Then you have three kids.
And that's the end of life!

356
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:52,164
Shut up, Yudi.
- Papa, I need to go potty.

357
00:24:52,223 --> 00:24:53,759
Mummy“
- It's called life!

358
00:24:54,392 --> 00:24:55,837
Whatever, dude.

359
00:25:00,264 --> 00:25:02,744
Couldn't you wait
for me a little longer?

360
00:25:03,301 --> 00:25:05,508
Why are we discussing this now?

361
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,681
I did wail, you know.
A really long time.

362
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:16,488
Hey, remember..

363
00:25:16,547 --> 00:25:18,754
“Our Vegas trip?
- Yeah!

364
00:25:18,816 --> 00:25:21,422
Mad trip, right?
- Let's just wipe that off memory.

365
00:25:21,485 --> 00:25:23,294
And our matching tattoos.

366
00:25:23,354 --> 00:25:26,198
You know, mine's faded a bit.
- No, no, it's okay.

367
00:25:26,257 --> 00:25:27,759
Don't take off your pants. It's okay.

368
00:25:27,825 --> 00:25:29,395
And yours? Is it fading too?

369
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,269
No! Mine's great.

370
00:25:31,562 --> 00:25:33,269
You still have it, right?

371
00:25:33,531 --> 00:25:34,339
Yeah!

372
00:25:34,398 --> 00:25:35,809
You didn't get it removed, did you?

373
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:39,545
You got it removed! Why?

374
00:25:40,271 --> 00:25:41,409
What do you mean, why?

375
00:25:41,472 --> 00:25:42,815
If Jason saw it, what would he think?

376
00:25:42,873 --> 00:25:44,580
Yudi!
- You could have made up something!

377
00:25:44,642 --> 00:25:46,383
He can't read Hindi anyway.
Let me see what you did.

378
00:25:46,444 --> 00:25:49,584
No. - Show me.
- Yudi, just stop it. - Show me.

379
00:25:49,647 --> 00:25:51,149
What is wrong with you?

380
00:25:51,215 --> 00:25:52,717
What the hell is going on?

381
00:25:53,551 --> 00:25:54,552
Hi, honey!

382
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:55,825
Who wears pink shorts, dude?

383
00:25:55,886 --> 00:25:58,662
If you break my marriage,
I will kill you. - Okay, okay!

384
00:26:02,627 --> 00:26:04,732
Here <i>we</i> go!

385
00:26:06,631 --> 00:26:07,609
Thanks.

386
00:26:07,665 --> 00:26:09,110
But you really didn't have to do this.

387
00:26:09,166 --> 00:26:11,077
I could've taken a taxi.
- Why taxi?

388
00:26:11,135 --> 00:26:14,241
I am your personal, sexy, chauffeur.

389
00:26:15,706 --> 00:26:17,014
Okay.

390
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:20,111
I'll be awhile. You go ahead.

391
00:26:20,177 --> 00:26:23,090
It's okay,
I've canceled all my appointments.

392
00:26:23,147 --> 00:26:24,626
Shall I wait for
you at the coffee shop?

393
00:26:24,682 --> 00:26:27,322
No, no, please don't wail for me.
Gary will drop me home.

394
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:30,389
Baby. I can wait for you all my life.

395
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:33,728
Isn't that a bit too long?

396
00:26:33,791 --> 00:26:35,702
Yudi, forever and ever!

397
00:26:36,294 --> 00:26:37,466
So sweet!

398
00:26:37,728 --> 00:26:39,207
Love you.

399
00:26:40,097 --> 00:26:41,633
I know you love me too.

400
00:26:41,832 --> 00:26:43,903
Hi, Yudi. How are you?

401
00:26:43,934 --> 00:26:45,436
How is life treating you?

402
00:26:45,469 --> 00:26:46,743
Cut the bullshit, Gary.

403
00:26:46,804 --> 00:26:48,283
Why did you call me here?

404
00:26:48,506 --> 00:26:50,782
Look, maybe this isn't the best“

405
00:26:50,841 --> 00:26:52,286
But this is all you have now.

406
00:26:52,343 --> 00:26:54,653
And I think you should do it.

407
00:26:56,213 --> 00:26:58,523
You got me some shady deal again?

408
00:26:58,582 --> 00:27:00,357
Do you want the car back or not?

409
00:27:15,633 --> 00:27:17,408
I liked your book.

410
00:27:17,468 --> 00:27:19,641
What was the name again?
- Operation Payback.

411
00:27:19,704 --> 00:27:22,184
Yes. Operation Playback.

412
00:27:22,506 --> 00:27:24,543
Payback.
- Yeah, right.

413
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:27,180
The story's good, tight.

414
00:27:27,244 --> 00:27:29,781
The second half is a bit slow.

415
00:27:29,847 --> 00:27:32,054
You read my book?
- He did.

416
00:27:32,483 --> 00:27:34,019
And explained it to me in two lines.

417
00:27:34,752 --> 00:27:36,322
Good. - Very good.

418
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:39,700
You see,

419
00:27:41,225 --> 00:27:42,533
I am a single-screen superstar.

420
00:27:43,461 --> 00:27:45,304
And now,
I want to take over the multiplexes.

421
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:48,576
I want to make a film..

422
00:27:49,233 --> 00:27:50,678
“That has everything.

423
00:27:51,335 --> 00:27:53,576
Romance. Comedy.

424
00:27:55,506 --> 00:27:56,814
I want a remedy!

425
00:27:58,209 --> 00:27:59,688
Two birds with one stone.

426
00:28:00,444 --> 00:28:01,388
What?

427
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,590
Classes and masses.

428
00:28:04,348 --> 00:28:06,157
Get them both.
- Great ideal

429
00:28:06,217 --> 00:28:07,719
Writers are such copycats nowadays.

430
00:28:07,785 --> 00:28:10,288
They make a dozen films
with the same successful idea.

431
00:28:10,354 --> 00:28:12,027
Someone's remaking
this hit South Indian film.

432
00:28:12,089 --> 00:28:13,159
Now everyone's working on
the same idea.

433
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:15,067
That's the business. - But, Sir,

434
00:28:15,126 --> 00:28:16,730
Why don't you sit here
instead of me? - Sir,

435
00:28:16,794 --> 00:28:18,205
No, no, I'll go get a message.

436
00:28:18,262 --> 00:28:20,742
You sit here.
- Sorry, Sir. Go on.

437
00:28:21,298 --> 00:28:23,574
Last night I saw this Hollywood film.

438
00:28:24,068 --> 00:28:25,411
And it just clicked.

439
00:28:25,469 --> 00:28:27,415
I knew then this is my gold standard.

440
00:28:27,671 --> 00:28:30,049
I took the next flight here.

441
00:28:30,408 --> 00:28:32,752
Now, I'm looking for a mixed writer“

442
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:34,756
...who can write a Bollywood
film, Hollywood-style.

443
00:28:34,812 --> 00:28:37,622
Mixed writer? Great idea.

444
00:28:37,681 --> 00:28:39,627
Money is not a problem.

445
00:28:40,084 --> 00:28:42,792
I want to make a film that has“

446
00:28:43,154 --> 00:28:47,603
Comedy, flirting and steaminess“

447
00:28:47,658 --> 00:28:48,659
Kickass!

448
00:28:48,726 --> 00:28:50,637
Kick ass?
- Kick ass!

449
00:28:50,694 --> 00:28:51,729
Kick ass!

450
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:53,507
Oh Kick ass!

451
00:28:54,198 --> 00:28:56,701
First half, Meet Parents.

452
00:28:56,767 --> 00:28:59,270
Second half, Meet Fuckers.

453
00:28:59,336 --> 00:29:01,441
Mix and match. We have a silver jubilee.

454
00:29:02,239 --> 00:29:04,185
Look, Armaan,

455
00:29:09,046 --> 00:29:10,116
<i>[u].</i>

456
00:29:10,681 --> 00:29:12,058
Armaan-ji.

457
00:29:12,416 --> 00:29:15,625
These are famous films.

458
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:19,262
We can't just copy, I mean“

459
00:29:19,824 --> 00:29:21,064
We'd get caught.

460
00:29:21,125 --> 00:29:22,536
So what good is he for?

461
00:29:22,593 --> 00:29:24,163
Get creative, man.

462
00:29:24,528 --> 00:29:27,065
So what if we're caught?
It's your neck on the line.

463
00:29:27,331 --> 00:29:29,208
But I'll get you out.
- We will.

464
00:29:29,266 --> 00:29:31,268
Can I tell you something, Armaan?

465
00:29:31,335 --> 00:29:35,545
You spent a fortune coming
here, and you're with the best writer.

466
00:29:35,606 --> 00:29:37,415
Let's get him to write something fresh.

467
00:29:37,741 --> 00:29:39,379
Where are you from originally?

468
00:29:41,512 --> 00:29:43,458
I am from San Francisco.

469
00:29:43,514 --> 00:29:44,686
No wonder.

470
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:46,787
Listen, do whatever, but“

471
00:29:47,151 --> 00:29:51,600
I want a young love story.
- Consider it done.

472
00:29:51,655 --> 00:29:56,126
He'll write a great story and
make you a ladies' heartthrob.

473
00:29:56,193 --> 00:29:59,299
In fact, I say you'll be
the heartthrob of the gents as well.

474
00:29:59,363 --> 00:30:01,502
Control, your emotions.

475
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:06,514
And, oh yeah, I spoke to
Jennifer, for an item song.

476
00:30:07,271 --> 00:30:09,376
Jennifer? - Our Jenny from the block?

477
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,316
JLo...JLo...

478
00:30:10,374 --> 00:30:12,615
Sorry, my bad. JLo.

479
00:30:12,676 --> 00:30:13,814
Jennifer.

480
00:30:14,178 --> 00:30:16,818
Just make sure the film
is a worldwide blockbuster.

481
00:30:16,881 --> 00:30:19,487
Done, Sir. I guarantee you.

482
00:30:24,555 --> 00:30:25,499
Kick ass.

483
00:30:25,556 --> 00:30:26,796
Kick ass.
- Kick ass.

484
00:30:27,191 --> 00:30:28,329
Sunglasses?

485
00:30:28,859 --> 00:30:30,236
Here you go, Sir.

486
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:36,739
Superstar. Heroine.

487
00:30:37,301 --> 00:30:38,279
JLo.

488
00:30:38,636 --> 00:30:40,377
Romantic comedy.

489
00:30:40,671 --> 00:30:42,844
Classes. Masses.

490
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,412
Bollywood.

491
00:30:44,742 --> 00:30:45,846
Multiplex.

492
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:47,780
Single screen.

493
00:30:50,347 --> 00:30:51,587
Kick ass.

494
00:30:58,822 --> 00:31:00,597
I am so screwed!

495
00:31:01,258 --> 00:31:02,532
Where do I get this kickass from?

496
00:31:02,593 --> 00:31:03,731
What am I there for?

497
00:31:05,129 --> 00:31:06,665
What do you know about romcoms?

498
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:08,710
Romantic comedy? Very easy.

499
00:31:09,099 --> 00:31:11,136
First, boy meets girl.

500
00:31:11,502 --> 00:31:13,243
They cross paths, just like that.

501
00:31:13,604 --> 00:31:16,778
They're polar opposites
but complete each other.

502
00:31:17,207 --> 00:31:18,447
Then, conversations.

503
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:20,420
Hello? But why? Because you..

504
00:31:20,477 --> 00:31:23,458
And then Love! Love! Love! Love!

505
00:31:23,514 --> 00:31:26,688
But, all boys are doggie.

506
00:31:27,151 --> 00:31:31,065
And all girls are not doggie.

507
00:31:31,655 --> 00:31:33,225
Something goes wrong.

508
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:36,760
Then comes "I've changed.
I'm completely sorry. I love you".

509
00:31:36,827 --> 00:31:38,431
In the end, everything's happy!

510
00:31:38,495 --> 00:31:41,135
But yes, the boy and
girl should be handsome.

511
00:31:41,198 --> 00:31:42,836
Costumes by Manish (Malhotra),
Abu Jani...

512
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,277
Music by Pritam.

513
00:31:44,768 --> 00:31:47,476
And if you go abroad
to shoot them, great.

514
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:49,643
That's how you write a romantic comedy!

515
00:32:02,853 --> 00:32:05,800
"And this is the secret
only true lovers share."

516
00:32:05,856 --> 00:32:10,134
"The joy they find in each other,
and the dreams they dare to dream.."

517
00:32:10,194 --> 00:32:13,698
"..is by virtue of the
power of love that engulfs them."

518
00:32:13,764 --> 00:32:17,268
"Consumes them.
And transcends all bounds."

519
00:32:17,334 --> 00:32:19,575
"So her thoughts were exactly this."

520
00:32:20,137 --> 00:32:22,811
"Love me..and free my soul."

521
00:32:22,873 --> 00:32:25,547
"I love you..and I adore you."

522
00:32:25,609 --> 00:32:27,452
"And I do this“
because I do not know.."

523
00:32:27,511 --> 00:32:28,717
"..any other way of loving."

524
00:32:29,146 --> 00:32:32,093
"And I am just thankful."

525
00:32:33,283 --> 00:32:35,058
$1 What the“!

526
00:32:37,354 --> 00:32:38,560
Thank you.

527
00:32:45,362 --> 00:32:47,569
Beautiful writing. Beautiful!

528
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,470
That last chapter“
tears just welled up.

529
00:32:50,534 --> 00:32:52,571
I was really choking.

530
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:55,272
Thank you. Thank you so much.

531
00:32:55,339 --> 00:32:56,283
I'm the one who wrote it.

532
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:59,082
But every time I read it,
it still makes me emotional.

533
00:32:59,376 --> 00:33:01,185
It's my favorite chapter.

534
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:02,383
Mine too.

535
00:33:02,446 --> 00:33:04,392
You've read my book?
- No.

536
00:33:04,848 --> 00:33:06,122
But I will now.

537
00:33:06,183 --> 00:33:08,356
For sure.
- I hope you like it.

538
00:33:15,426 --> 00:33:17,565
Incidentally,
what kind of books do you like?

539
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:21,573
I like all kinds of books.

540
00:33:21,632 --> 00:33:24,203
Put a telephone directory
in front of me, I'll even read that!

541
00:33:26,837 --> 00:33:29,477
Have you read this book?
I hear it's really good.

542
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:32,282
That's a really old book.
It's still on the shelves?

543
00:33:32,342 --> 00:33:33,616
Well, it's a classic.

544
00:33:33,677 --> 00:33:36,817
Classic? Why, there's no depth in it.

545
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,416
He wrote something. And“

546
00:33:38,482 --> 00:33:39,483
“he just got lucky.

547
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:42,087
You just said you
like all kinds of books.

548
00:33:42,152 --> 00:33:43,290
What's so wrong with this one?

549
00:33:43,353 --> 00:33:44,331
It's just a one-book wonder.

550
00:33:44,388 --> 00:33:46,834
He wrote something for the heck
of it and it became a hit. By fluke.

551
00:33:47,124 --> 00:33:49,195
My agent said he's totally ruined.

552
00:33:49,259 --> 00:33:50,670
Poor guy's on the streets now.

553
00:33:50,728 --> 00:33:52,435
Should I sign you a copy?

554
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:56,678
Your name?
- Yu..

555
00:33:57,501 --> 00:33:58,479
Yogi.

556
00:34:01,505 --> 00:34:03,451
Yogi. See you.

557
00:34:12,783 --> 00:34:14,785
Hang on a second.

558
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:18,563
Half of them fell asleep listening.

559
00:34:18,822 --> 00:34:22,326
Actually, I almost
fell asleep reading!

560
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,430
You know, I don't get it.

561
00:34:24,495 --> 00:34:26,668
Why do people show up at readings?

562
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:29,176
Clearly, they have
nothing better to do.

563
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:32,237
If they love books, why can't they
just buy the book and read it at home?

564
00:34:32,302 --> 00:34:33,804
Omigod! I forgot to tell you.

565
00:34:34,104 --> 00:34:35,811
After the reading,
an Indian came up to me..

566
00:34:36,106 --> 00:34:39,713
“And said, "Beautiful
writing“ my eyes welled up..

567
00:34:39,777 --> 00:34:42,656
"..L was choking..
Really choking."

568
00:34:43,313 --> 00:34:44,758
What a pansy!

569
00:34:45,616 --> 00:34:46,788
I know right?

570
00:34:47,117 --> 00:34:49,188
I'm actually writing
all this romantic bull..

571
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:50,323
Which people are buying..

572
00:34:50,387 --> 00:34:52,128
And getting sentimental,
can you believe it?

573
00:34:52,689 --> 00:34:53,759
I know!

574
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:56,270
If anyone hears me like this“

575
00:34:56,326 --> 00:34:58,465
“That's it. I'll be banned.

576
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:04,236
Hello. - She's a fraud!

577
00:35:04,301 --> 00:35:07,373
That girl is a fraud. And she
had the gall to criticize my book!

578
00:35:07,437 --> 00:35:09,439
Yudi, I am pregnant.

579
00:35:09,506 --> 00:35:14,046
She's selling rubbish and she knows it.
Her readers are all a big joke for her!

580
00:35:14,111 --> 00:35:15,249
Man, I am the joke here.

581
00:35:15,312 --> 00:35:18,691
I'm going to read her book..
Throw it on her face and say“

582
00:35:18,749 --> 00:35:19,750
"This is nonsense."

583
00:35:20,083 --> 00:35:23,394
I am having an oops baby.
- What?

584
00:35:23,453 --> 00:35:25,660
Oops...baby.

585
00:35:26,089 --> 00:35:27,432
Oops!

586
00:35:28,258 --> 00:35:30,238
Congratulations?

587
00:35:30,861 --> 00:35:32,204
Montu?

588
00:35:33,564 --> 00:35:35,407
This is our Wall of Fame.

589
00:35:35,465 --> 00:35:37,604
All bestselling authors.

590
00:35:37,668 --> 00:35:41,514
And here you are.
Got it put up just yesterday.

591
00:35:42,105 --> 00:35:43,083
How is it?

592
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,783
Cool, right?
- Yeah!

593
00:35:48,145 --> 00:35:49,647
What a rogue!

594
00:35:56,553 --> 00:35:57,327
Oh..

595
00:35:57,688 --> 00:35:58,359
Oh!

596
00:35:58,422 --> 00:35:59,594
We meet again.

597
00:35:59,656 --> 00:36:01,727
I read your book.
- I see.

598
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:04,170
Mind-blowing!

599
00:36:04,228 --> 00:36:06,765
The way you've explained love..

600
00:36:07,097 --> 00:36:11,443
And that line, "To gain something,
you have to lose something."

601
00:36:12,302 --> 00:36:13,372
What an original line!

602
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:15,178
Every page had me emotional.

603
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:17,276
I sat with a box of tissues“

604
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:20,279
I know who you are.
- Really?

605
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:22,153
I saw your photo upstairs.

606
00:36:22,212 --> 00:36:23,623
Gary told me all about you.

607
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,420
Oh!

608
00:36:24,748 --> 00:36:25,692
Oh?

609
00:36:27,251 --> 00:36:28,355
I hope he said good things.

610
00:36:28,418 --> 00:36:31,490
He said to me, "You could
be very successful“

611
00:36:31,555 --> 00:36:33,432
"Just never Yudi your life."

612
00:36:34,491 --> 00:36:35,469
That Idiot!

613
00:36:35,525 --> 00:36:38,131
Hold on. Did he say
this or are you saying it?

614
00:36:38,195 --> 00:36:39,572
What is your problem?

615
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:41,166
Why are you following me?

616
00:36:42,232 --> 00:36:43,575
I am writing a romantic comedy.

617
00:36:43,867 --> 00:36:45,778
And I thought I'd read your book.

618
00:36:46,103 --> 00:36:48,083
And guess what I found out“

619
00:36:48,705 --> 00:36:52,278
You are a fraud!
- What? What do you mean?

620
00:36:52,576 --> 00:36:54,647
"If anyone hears
me like this..."

621
00:36:54,711 --> 00:36:57,715
"..I'll be banned."
- Stop it.

622
00:36:57,781 --> 00:37:01,593
"I such am a big writer now.
All of America has read my book."

623
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:04,189
"My agent says I am No. 1."

624
00:37:04,254 --> 00:37:06,325
"What I didn't know is that agent“

625
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,461
...gives this spiel
to all his clients.

626
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:18,237
By the way, you write well.

627
00:37:18,302 --> 00:37:19,713
But I have to tell you one thing.

628
00:37:20,103 --> 00:37:22,083
Your book readings are so boring..

629
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:23,743
“That people were falling asleep.

630
00:37:24,474 --> 00:37:26,750
I'm sure some even died.
- It's okay.

631
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:29,154
My books sell.

632
00:37:29,579 --> 00:37:31,354
Yes, but the question
is entertainment.

633
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:34,157
How do we make your
readings more entertaining?

634
00:37:34,217 --> 00:37:35,161
You don't need to do anything.

635
00:37:35,218 --> 00:37:36,162
I'll manage.

636
00:37:36,219 --> 00:37:39,792
How about some advice from a senior,
super successful writer“

637
00:37:39,856 --> 00:37:42,803
“to a budding writer?
- No, thank you.

638
00:37:44,294 --> 00:37:45,671
Shh! Just listen.

639
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:49,368
People aren't there for
your reading skills, you know?

640
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:52,346
They're there to meet the writer
- see if his personality is exciting..

641
00:37:52,402 --> 00:37:54,382
...all his experiences in life.

642
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:57,510
What, should I read out my biodata?
- No, but be charming.

643
00:37:57,808 --> 00:38:00,618
Chat with your audience,
crack some jokes.

644
00:38:00,677 --> 00:38:02,486
They'll read your book at home.

645
00:38:02,546 --> 00:38:04,492
So for one hour,
spend 15 minutes reading.

646
00:38:04,548 --> 00:38:06,494
Nonsense your way
through the remaining 45.

647
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:08,154
That's how you make fans.

648
00:38:08,218 --> 00:38:10,095
One second, who are you?

649
00:38:10,754 --> 00:38:15,760
Best-selling writer, friend,
philosopher, stud! Nice to meet you.

650
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,037
Pleasure is all yours.

651
00:38:33,276 --> 00:38:35,483
Yudi-pudie pie!
- Aaarrghh!

652
00:38:38,248 --> 00:38:40,455
What are you doing here?
- Giving you a lift.

653
00:38:40,517 --> 00:38:42,019
But...why..

654
00:38:42,552 --> 00:38:44,088
How did you know I'm here?

655
00:38:44,154 --> 00:38:47,601
So I downloaded this app
on both our phones.

656
00:38:47,657 --> 00:38:50,501
It tells me where you are. Always.

657
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,437
It's called No Space!

658
00:38:53,597 --> 00:38:56,168
Are you tracking me?
- I love you.

659
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,677
Come on, let's go.
- Where?

660
00:38:58,735 --> 00:39:00,078
Where?

661
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:06,550
Happy birthday 10..

662
00:39:09,379 --> 00:39:10,517
Oh no!

663
00:39:11,181 --> 00:39:13,252
Is it your Dad? Mom?

664
00:39:13,316 --> 00:39:15,728
You had an appointment today.
- What appointment?

665
00:39:16,053 --> 00:39:17,589
Dentist?
- Oh no, no, I'm fine.

666
00:39:17,654 --> 00:39:19,031
Don't be a baby. Come on.

667
00:39:19,089 --> 00:39:21,126
Please! I don't want to go, Vishakha.

668
00:39:21,191 --> 00:39:22,101
Listen-

669
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:24,139
You've done a lot for my teeth.

670
00:39:24,194 --> 00:39:26,504
But this time, I'm okay. Really!

671
00:39:35,605 --> 00:39:38,381
I have to say, this Aanchal girl?
I dig her.

672
00:39:38,442 --> 00:39:39,750
She's just right for you.

673
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:41,551
Whatever floats your boat, man.

674
00:39:42,746 --> 00:39:46,751
Wow! What a fluke.
- Your birth was a fluke, man.

675
00:39:48,785 --> 00:39:50,765
And Vishakha?
- Oh, yeah.

676
00:39:51,254 --> 00:39:53,427
I've got to break up with her. Again.

677
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:55,169
This time, I'll do it right.

678
00:39:55,225 --> 00:39:56,499
Here I am,
frikking about to be a Dad“

679
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,166
“there you are, playing
breakup-patchup.

680
00:40:00,497 --> 00:40:01,771
Nonsense!

681
00:40:02,332 --> 00:40:03,333
You know what she did?

682
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,779
She's put a tracker in my phone.
- What?I

683
00:40:06,837 --> 00:40:09,443
She knows we're at the golf
link right now. - Really?

684
00:40:11,141 --> 00:40:13,121
That is some psycho nonsense!

685
00:40:13,677 --> 00:40:15,679
Why're you not breaking
up with her cleanly?

686
00:40:15,745 --> 00:40:17,520
It's not that difficult.
- It is difficult.

687
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:19,492
That's why half
the world's like this.

688
00:40:21,384 --> 00:40:23,591
Nonsense man! Not again!

689
00:40:23,653 --> 00:40:25,257
I'm telling you
these clubs are screwed.

690
00:40:25,322 --> 00:40:27,233
Yes, Montu.
It's all the club's fault.

691
00:40:37,167 --> 00:40:38,373
Yudi cutie pie!

692
00:40:38,435 --> 00:40:39,345
<i>Knew'</i>

693
00:40:45,375 --> 00:40:49,482
I ordered your favorite cheesecake.
- Ooh! Cheesecake.

694
00:40:50,147 --> 00:40:51,285
Caramel.

695
00:40:53,383 --> 00:40:54,361
So.

696
00:40:54,417 --> 00:40:55,259
So.

697
00:40:55,318 --> 00:40:57,525
Vishakha.
I've been thinking for a while-

698
00:40:57,587 --> 00:40:59,362
Taste this.

699
00:40:59,923 --> 00:41:01,732
How is it?
- Very nice.

700
00:41:01,791 --> 00:41:05,295
Yummy, right?
- So I've been thinking for a while“

701
00:41:05,695 --> 00:41:08,301
“we've known each other six months.
- 17!

702
00:41:08,665 --> 00:41:11,339
What?
- We met at Aarti and Adam's wedding.

703
00:41:11,401 --> 00:41:14,405
Oh! You're calculating from then?
- Of course! Because-

704
00:41:14,471 --> 00:41:18,317
Two weeks later, at Nancy's party,
you kissed me.

705
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:19,786
Really?
- Yeah.

706
00:41:19,843 --> 00:41:21,618
I don't think so.
- Yeah.

707
00:41:21,678 --> 00:41:24,318
I must've kissed you on your cheeks.
- No, no, no, it was a proper kiss.

708
00:41:24,381 --> 00:41:25,724
Let me show you.
- No!

709
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,652
Okay! I'm sorry,
just get carried away.

710
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:32,362
Anyway, what I meant to say is“

711
00:41:32,422 --> 00:41:34,595
The two of us“
The way we..

712
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:36,600
You like traveling.
- Yes.

713
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,333
I hate traveling.
- Oh!

714
00:41:38,395 --> 00:41:42,207
You like cheesecake, and“
you think I love cheesecake“

715
00:41:42,265 --> 00:41:45,212
But I hate it.
- Shall I order chocolate then?

716
00:41:46,503 --> 00:41:48,505
It doesn't matter what cake it is.

717
00:41:48,872 --> 00:41:51,785
What I mean is we're different.

718
00:41:52,242 --> 00:41:54,848
You mean..we're opposites?
- Yes, we're opposites.

719
00:41:54,911 --> 00:41:57,152
People say opposites attract!

720
00:41:57,681 --> 00:42:00,252
That happens with magnets,
not with humans.

721
00:42:00,517 --> 00:42:02,224
With humans, opposites attack.

722
00:42:02,285 --> 00:42:05,391
Like India-Pakistan.
- But India-Pakistan are the same.

723
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:07,498
They both want Kashmir.

724
00:42:07,824 --> 00:42:11,636
Yeah, you know, opposites do attract.
Like that song.

725
00:42:14,564 --> 00:42:19,240
We come together 'coz opposites
attract. Who'd have thought, aah!

726
00:42:21,871 --> 00:42:23,509
I love the 80's.

727
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:25,652
Okay.

728
00:42:26,142 --> 00:42:28,816
Okay. Let me start over.

729
00:42:29,312 --> 00:42:32,452
We met 11 months ago,
and I kissed you at Nancy's home.

730
00:42:32,515 --> 00:42:33,585
Not cheek-to-cheek, but lip-to-lip.

731
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:36,096
We're opposites, and
people think opposites attract.

732
00:42:36,152 --> 00:42:39,599
You want me so much there's
not one tooth in my mouth you..

733
00:42:39,656 --> 00:42:40,760
...haven't left alone.
Still, I think we both-

734
00:42:40,824 --> 00:42:43,134
What?
Why're you giving me your phone?

735
00:42:43,193 --> 00:42:44,570
Have I shown you this before?

736
00:42:44,828 --> 00:42:48,435
You know I'm trying to explain
something to you. - Take a look, baby.

737
00:42:50,433 --> 00:42:51,776
Who's the naked ass?

738
00:42:56,339 --> 00:42:57,511
The naked ass is me?I

739
00:42:58,208 --> 00:43:02,281
How? When?
- You're such a cutie!

740
00:43:04,114 --> 00:43:06,651
How did you do this?
- You looked so cute that day..

741
00:43:06,716 --> 00:43:08,753
I'm really sorry,
I couldn't help myself.

742
00:43:09,085 --> 00:43:11,793
Okay Vishakha, you have to delete that.
- No.

743
00:43:12,155 --> 00:43:14,795
If it leaks somehow,
I'll be embarrassed as hell.

744
00:43:14,858 --> 00:43:17,236
Aww.... you're shy.
- No!

745
00:43:17,294 --> 00:43:19,399
But if this comes out,
I'll be a joke.

746
00:43:19,462 --> 00:43:21,499
I'm a celebrity.
- Chill, baby.

747
00:43:21,564 --> 00:43:23,566
I'm hardly going to
put it up on Facebook.

748
00:43:25,201 --> 00:43:26,305
Vishakha, please. Come on.

749
00:43:26,369 --> 00:43:28,474
Alright. Alright. We'll delete it.

750
00:43:28,538 --> 00:43:30,677
What if my baby's video goes viral?

751
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:32,779
Please delete it.

752
00:43:34,144 --> 00:43:37,421
I'll watch it at home.
I have a copy on my laptop.

753
00:43:38,815 --> 00:43:39,759
You okay, baby?

754
00:43:39,816 --> 00:43:41,159
You (gibberish) at home?
- Huh?

755
00:43:41,217 --> 00:43:42,252
You have it at home?

756
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:44,629
Yes. I got everything
backed up.

757
00:43:44,688 --> 00:43:46,463
If you wanted to prance
in the shower,

758
00:43:46,523 --> 00:43:47,797
...you could've at least
locked the door from inside.

759
00:43:48,124 --> 00:43:49,831
Montu, you're stuck
on the wrong detail.

760
00:43:49,893 --> 00:43:52,601
I mean, when I shower,
I always lock the door from inside.

761
00:43:52,662 --> 00:43:54,573
And from the outside, when
Gauri's in the shower.

762
00:43:54,631 --> 00:43:58,101
Montu! Focus.
Get me out of this mess.

763
00:43:58,501 --> 00:43:59,605
Walk with me.

764
00:43:59,669 --> 00:44:01,740
You deleted the
video on her phone.

765
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:05,514
She has a copy of it on her laptop.

766
00:44:05,575 --> 00:44:07,452
And the laptop's at her home. Right.

767
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:08,682
So, here's the plan.

768
00:44:09,679 --> 00:44:11,681
We'll sneak into her house“

769
00:44:12,115 --> 00:44:15,426
“and delete that
file from her laptop.

770
00:44:15,485 --> 00:44:17,431
She's leaving! She's leaving!

771
00:44:17,487 --> 00:44:19,660
Where did you call her?
- Arclight Theatre.

772
00:44:20,123 --> 00:44:21,466
So, we have an hour.

773
00:44:22,158 --> 00:44:23,501
Step 1. Successful.

774
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,369
If we get caught,
we'll be thrown in jail.

775
00:44:25,662 --> 00:44:28,165
That may be your hangout spot,
it's not mine.

776
00:44:28,231 --> 00:44:29,209
Every newspaper will carry my photos

777
00:44:29,265 --> 00:44:30,608
...on the front page

778
00:44:30,667 --> 00:44:31,475
And you know how..

779
00:44:31,534 --> 00:44:33,741
...nasty the media can be to
us celebrities if we make a mistake.

780
00:44:34,771 --> 00:44:37,274
Hey, Yudi. Can I tell you something?

781
00:44:38,308 --> 00:44:41,687
You're not as famous
as you think you are.

782
00:44:42,379 --> 00:44:45,258
I mean, this whole office?
No one's read your book.

783
00:44:45,515 --> 00:44:48,519
Hey, Rachael!
Hi. Have you read Operation Payback?

784
00:44:48,585 --> 00:44:49,529
No.

785
00:44:49,786 --> 00:44:51,527
Hey, Rico.
Did you read Operation Payback?

786
00:44:51,588 --> 00:44:53,192
Okay, okay, okay, let's go.

787
00:44:53,256 --> 00:44:55,293
Did you delete that tracker
app on your phone? - Yes!

788
00:44:55,358 --> 00:44:56,803
Step 2. Find the key.

789
00:44:59,162 --> 00:45:00,436
Step 3. Open the door.

790
00:45:01,431 --> 00:45:04,105
Okay Montu, I just realized.
This is a very bad idea.

791
00:45:04,167 --> 00:45:06,647
Shut it, you coward.
I told you. Trust me.

792
00:45:06,703 --> 00:45:09,479
The whole world will talk
about our robbery story forever.

793
00:45:09,773 --> 00:45:12,686
Maybe this is the excitement
I need in my life.

794
00:45:12,742 --> 00:45:14,449
Maybe even spice up my marriage.

795
00:45:14,511 --> 00:45:16,422
Yudi, I need this.

796
00:45:16,846 --> 00:45:18,291
Help me, please.

797
00:45:18,815 --> 00:45:20,761
I thought I asked you for help.

798
00:45:26,256 --> 00:45:27,360
Come on!

799
00:45:28,124 --> 00:45:30,570
I've never been inside a
single woman's place before.

800
00:45:30,627 --> 00:45:33,164
Because you got married
when you were a kid.

801
00:45:34,764 --> 00:45:36,300
So many pillows?I

802
00:45:36,633 --> 00:45:38,476
Why do girls need so many pillows?

803
00:45:38,535 --> 00:45:40,640
Montu, don't touch anything!

804
00:45:40,703 --> 00:45:42,808
Girls have a strong sixth
sense about these things.

805
00:45:42,872 --> 00:45:45,352
No! It's asking for a password.

806
00:45:48,645 --> 00:45:51,683
What's her favorite film?
- Love, Actually.

807
00:45:54,417 --> 00:45:56,624
You're her boyfriend,
think of another option.

808
00:45:57,253 --> 00:46:00,427
I Love Yudi!
- You egomaniac!

809
00:46:06,095 --> 00:46:07,699
Aah..l

810
00:46:12,135 --> 00:46:15,048
Yudi, look what I found!
Pink Panther.

811
00:46:15,104 --> 00:46:16,708
What are you doing?
She's my girlfriend.

812
00:46:16,773 --> 00:46:18,252
Whose girlfriend?
You just broke up with her.

813
00:46:18,308 --> 00:46:19,651
Until we don't breakup-breakup,
she's my girlfriend“

814
00:46:19,709 --> 00:46:21,211
...and your sister-in-law.

815
00:46:21,277 --> 00:46:23,223
Do I ever have wrong
intentions about Gauri?

816
00:46:23,279 --> 00:46:25,281
As if I get wrong
intentions about Gauri!

817
00:46:25,348 --> 00:46:27,385
Why can't Gauri wear
something like this?

818
00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:29,657
I'm sick of those
white and grey vests!

819
00:46:34,824 --> 00:46:36,303
Montu!

820
00:46:38,761 --> 00:46:40,502
She forgot the tickets.

821
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:11,762
Let me see. Please...

822
00:47:13,162 --> 00:47:14,573
Let me see. Please...

823
00:47:36,853 --> 00:47:39,527
Let's go! This was a terrible plan.
- Stop.

824
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:42,736
We'll do what we came hereto do.

825
00:47:44,494 --> 00:47:45,802
Are you crazy? What are you doing?

826
00:47:45,862 --> 00:47:47,535
Operation Payback.

827
00:47:53,303 --> 00:47:54,748
Come on. Come on.

828
00:47:57,574 --> 00:47:59,315
Nonsense! It's locked!

829
00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:03,053
We'll have to jump again.

830
00:48:03,813 --> 00:48:06,692
Watch carefully and repeat.
- No chance.

831
00:48:06,749 --> 00:48:08,490
You jump and
open the door for me.

832
00:48:08,551 --> 00:48:10,758
I don't want the father
of my kid to be a cripple.

833
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:12,360
Cowardass!

834
00:48:41,117 --> 00:48:42,653
Hi, Aanchal?
- Yudi.

835
00:48:42,719 --> 00:48:44,756
What? Who's this?

836
00:48:45,121 --> 00:48:46,498
Armaan..Ji. Superstar?

837
00:48:46,556 --> 00:48:48,467
Don't you recognize the voice?

838
00:48:50,627 --> 00:48:53,540
Oh...hi, Mr Armaanji.

839
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:56,743
Armaanji. What's up?
- What what's up?

840
00:48:56,799 --> 00:48:58,107
You called. You tell me what's up.

841
00:48:58,167 --> 00:48:59,737
No, nothing. Nothing.

842
00:48:59,802 --> 00:49:03,978
I just called lo tell you your
script's coming along very well.

843
00:49:04,707 --> 00:49:06,482
Totally kickass!

844
00:49:07,176 --> 00:49:10,089
Good, good! The songs are
superhit already. - Songs?

845
00:49:10,146 --> 00:49:11,682
You can't make a
remedy without songs.

846
00:49:12,081 --> 00:49:14,220
Make sure the song situations
are believable.

847
00:49:14,283 --> 00:49:16,763
No forced songs, understood?
- Yes, of course.

848
00:49:16,819 --> 00:49:19,060
There are two kinds
of superhit songs.

849
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:22,501
Either you shake it up
at the disco... or in bed!

850
00:49:22,558 --> 00:49:25,471
Wow! This knowledge
has to comes from experience.

851
00:49:25,528 --> 00:49:28,441
And hey,
add a few kissing scenes as well.

852
00:49:28,498 --> 00:49:30,569
The young man should love it.
- The milkman?

853
00:49:30,633 --> 00:49:33,273
Yes, Sir.
I can see why that's important.

854
00:49:33,336 --> 00:49:36,112
The youth, not the milkman.
-Oh! Youth!

855
00:49:36,172 --> 00:49:39,346
I am making a movie, I'm not making tea.
- Yes sir. Absolutely.

856
00:49:39,409 --> 00:49:40,717
Listen, I am at the gym right now.

857
00:49:40,777 --> 00:49:43,155
Tightening up my body.
Call me later.

858
00:49:43,212 --> 00:49:45,590
Listen, we've recorded
a song for our film.

859
00:49:45,648 --> 00:49:46,786
It's a funky song.

860
00:49:46,849 --> 00:49:49,420
I am throwing a party
on Saturday. Do come.

861
00:49:49,485 --> 00:49:51,294
Yes, of course.

862
00:49:51,354 --> 00:49:52,799
This is the basic price list.

863
00:49:52,855 --> 00:49:55,802
Sir, it's $10,000 for six-pack abs.

864
00:49:55,858 --> 00:49:57,360
$10,000 for a new nose.

865
00:49:57,427 --> 00:49:59,270
And $10,000 for the face.

866
00:49:59,328 --> 00:50:01,330
Tell him to do it for $15,000.

867
00:50:01,397 --> 00:50:03,502
When I take off my
shirt in the movie..

868
00:50:03,566 --> 00:50:05,307
“The whole industry
will line up here.

869
00:50:05,368 --> 00:50:07,370
He's just struck gold with me.
- Sir.

870
00:50:13,109 --> 00:50:14,383
Hello.
- Hey, Aanchal.

871
00:50:15,411 --> 00:50:17,118
Hey, Aanchal!
- Who is this?

872
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:19,558
This is Yudi.
- Yudi who?

873
00:50:19,615 --> 00:50:20,821
Yudi!

874
00:50:20,883 --> 00:50:24,729
Yudi? We met the other day.
I write books.

875
00:50:24,787 --> 00:50:27,700
Well...book.
- Right. Right. Right.

876
00:50:27,757 --> 00:50:31,762
Senior writer,
friend, philosopher, guide. - Stud.

877
00:50:32,128 --> 00:50:34,802
Of course.
- Gary gave me your number.

878
00:50:35,131 --> 00:50:37,111
Just to check up on you.
- Gary?

879
00:50:37,166 --> 00:50:37,803
Yeah.

880
00:50:38,134 --> 00:50:41,547
Hi. Did you give Yudi my number?
- Yudi?

881
00:50:41,604 --> 00:50:42,776
No.

882
00:50:43,773 --> 00:50:46,777
That was so thoughtful of him.
And so nice of you.

883
00:50:47,143 --> 00:50:48,850
I was wondering if you're
getting bored in LA..

884
00:50:49,178 --> 00:50:50,657
Who has the time to get bored,

885
00:50:50,713 --> 00:50:53,557
with all the meetings and readings?
- Yes.

886
00:50:53,616 --> 00:50:55,118
That's true.

887
00:50:55,418 --> 00:50:57,193
What do you do at night?
- What?

888
00:50:57,253 --> 00:51:00,791
I meant, in the evenings,
after your meetings.

889
00:51:01,124 --> 00:51:03,695
If you want to see LA,
maybe I can show you around.

890
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:06,172
I've been seeing
only LA all these days?

891
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:07,572
How about we do
something this weekend?

892
00:51:07,630 --> 00:51:09,610
You want to take me out on a date?
- No, no.

893
00:51:09,665 --> 00:51:11,736
What I mean is“ coffee or something?

894
00:51:11,801 --> 00:51:13,405
Just like that“ Over the weekend.

895
00:51:13,469 --> 00:51:14,607
Just like that.

896
00:51:15,371 --> 00:51:18,318
I'm sorry, I have
an important meeting on Saturday.

897
00:51:20,109 --> 00:51:21,281
Well, okay.

898
00:51:21,577 --> 00:51:24,786
If something gets canceled,
call me.

899
00:51:25,114 --> 00:51:28,789
Yeah, of course. Take care. Bye.

900
00:51:33,122 --> 00:51:34,328
Loser!

901
00:51:34,390 --> 00:51:36,734
Don't you have anything to do?
- You don't either.

902
00:51:37,593 --> 00:51:39,630
If you can't scoop
butter with your finger“

903
00:51:42,665 --> 00:51:44,804
“overturn the can.
- Means?

904
00:51:45,168 --> 00:51:46,203
Gar!!-

905
00:51:46,402 --> 00:51:47,403
No, sorry!

906
00:51:47,470 --> 00:51:49,848
I can't cancel Aanchal's
Meeting on Saturday.

907
00:51:50,173 --> 00:51:53,746
Oh really, then you won't
get your script either. - What?

908
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:57,656
Aanchal's really busy,
she's working hard.

909
00:51:58,214 --> 00:51:59,750
Don't turn her into a Yudi.

910
00:51:59,816 --> 00:52:02,626
How dare you turn me into a saying?

911
00:52:02,685 --> 00:52:04,665
Don't Yudi your life“
That's a Yudi move?

912
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,631
Does your Mom know about
your happy ending massages“

913
00:52:06,689 --> 00:52:08,225
“with that Roberto?

914
00:52:08,524 --> 00:52:11,130
Why you trying to screw me over?

915
00:52:11,194 --> 00:52:12,798
Stop effing with me!

916
00:52:12,862 --> 00:52:15,638
Then cancel the meeting.
- No, Yudi. I wish I could.

917
00:52:15,698 --> 00:52:17,371
But I can't!

918
00:52:17,433 --> 00:52:18,639
Cancelled it.

919
00:52:20,236 --> 00:52:24,707
Actually, you know what? For you, done!
- Good.

920
00:52:24,774 --> 00:52:27,380
But you'll have to
hand over my script real soon.

921
00:52:27,443 --> 00:52:29,252
I'll think about it.

922
00:52:32,882 --> 00:52:34,225
It's Aanchal.

923
00:52:38,521 --> 00:52:41,365
Hello? Who's this?
- Aanchal.

924
00:52:41,424 --> 00:52:43,233
Aanchal who?

925
00:52:43,292 --> 00:52:45,829
Whom you wanted to
take out on a date 5 minutes ago?

926
00:52:46,162 --> 00:52:47,505
Oh, hey! Hi.

927
00:52:47,563 --> 00:52:49,839
Sorry, I answered
my phone without looking.

928
00:52:49,899 --> 00:52:51,640
$0..
- Right. Okay.

929
00:52:51,701 --> 00:52:55,376
Anyway, Gary just told me my
Saturday's meeting's been canceled.

930
00:52:55,438 --> 00:52:57,418
$0..
- So?

931
00:52:57,473 --> 00:52:59,111
So if you're busy it's okay,
I'll call you later, bye!

932
00:52:59,175 --> 00:53:00,381
No, no, wait, wait, wait!

933
00:53:00,443 --> 00:53:02,184
Saturday, 9 pm?

934
00:53:02,478 --> 00:53:04,788
Okay.
- Great! Bye.

935
00:53:06,215 --> 00:53:08,161
Idiot.
- lg happens!

936
00:53:16,859 --> 00:53:19,362
Are you sure, it's okay?
- It will be fun, don't worry.

937
00:53:19,428 --> 00:53:20,566
Hop so?

938
00:53:51,727 --> 00:53:53,172
Hi Arman sir.
- Hi.

939
00:53:53,229 --> 00:53:55,470
Hello.
- She is your girlfriend.

940
00:53:55,531 --> 00:53:56,669
My friend Achal.

941
00:55:50,813 --> 00:55:52,554
Okay bye, sir.

942
00:55:52,615 --> 00:55:53,719
Let's go.

943
00:56:10,699 --> 00:56:11,404
Nonsense!

944
00:56:11,467 --> 00:56:12,707
Yudi? Vishakha.

945
00:56:20,242 --> 00:56:22,745
Hi, Vishakha.
- How dare you?

946
00:56:22,812 --> 00:56:26,624
Oh, so you know.
- So it is true!

947
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:32,192
How could you do this to me?

948
00:56:32,254 --> 00:56:33,562
Vishakha, l..

949
00:56:34,256 --> 00:56:36,793
This was all Montu's idea.
- Don't bring me into it.

950
00:56:37,126 --> 00:56:39,572
What?
- Yes. About sneaking into your house.

951
00:56:40,096 --> 00:56:43,168
Oh my God.
- Your computer? He smashed it.

952
00:56:43,632 --> 00:56:47,079
Oh my God!
So it was you the other day?

953
00:56:47,436 --> 00:56:49,040
You didn't know?

954
00:56:49,472 --> 00:56:50,644
So what were you mad about?

955
00:56:50,706 --> 00:56:53,209
No wonder
I smelt you all over the house!

956
00:56:53,275 --> 00:56:55,312
And I thought I was missing you.

957
00:56:55,377 --> 00:56:57,653
I'm so stupid!

958
00:56:57,713 --> 00:57:00,626
You know what,
I deserve better than this.

959
00:57:02,318 --> 00:57:04,025
I am sorry, Vishakha, l..

960
00:57:10,126 --> 00:57:12,003
Actually, you know what?

961
00:57:12,495 --> 00:57:15,772
You're absolutely right.
You do deserve better.

962
00:57:16,132 --> 00:57:18,442
You should spend your
life with a better man.

963
00:57:18,501 --> 00:57:20,174
I'm not good enough for you.

964
00:57:20,236 --> 00:57:23,183
Are you trying to get rid of me?
- What?

965
00:57:23,239 --> 00:57:25,549
No! Not at all.
- For that girl?

966
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:30,148
What? Which girl? - I know
all about you and that“ 'writer'.

967
00:57:30,212 --> 00:57:31,691
Oh!
- Oh?

968
00:57:32,181 --> 00:57:34,320
Is that all you have
to say for yourself?

969
00:57:34,650 --> 00:57:37,153
You're cheating on me, Yudi.
You broke my heart.

970
00:57:37,219 --> 00:57:40,723
No, Vishakha, there's nothing
between us. - Don't lie to me!

971
00:57:40,789 --> 00:57:43,793
You're having an affair
with that pseudo, intellectual..

972
00:57:43,859 --> 00:57:46,465
“Matching-matching,
rice-plate Reddy, aren't you?

973
00:57:46,529 --> 00:57:49,772
No.. We're just friends.

974
00:57:50,099 --> 00:57:53,103
Nothing's happened
- no kiss-wiss, sex-wax“

975
00:57:53,369 --> 00:57:57,283
And anyway“
we're not together anymore.

976
00:57:59,141 --> 00:58:03,647
You and I are not
together-together anymore, right?

977
00:58:09,351 --> 00:58:10,489
Are we?

978
00:58:16,458 --> 00:58:18,768
Gimme five!
- It's not confirmed yet.

979
00:58:18,827 --> 00:58:21,307
It is confirmed.
That's all the confirmation you need.

980
00:58:21,363 --> 00:58:23,240
Beyond this is your judgment.

981
00:58:23,299 --> 00:58:25,279
Come on, gimme five!

982
00:58:25,334 --> 00:58:27,075
I feel bad for her.
- Gimme five!

983
00:58:27,136 --> 00:58:28,046
On this side!

984
00:58:28,103 --> 00:58:32,176
Gimme ten“ you're free again“
- You two are celebrating?!

985
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:40,226
You both should be ashamed.

986
00:58:42,851 --> 00:58:44,524
Move! Out of my way!

987
00:58:44,587 --> 00:58:47,466
Be ashamed.
Now your chapter is over.

988
00:59:00,402 --> 00:59:02,040
<i>KM'! Baby</i>

989
00:59:52,221 --> 00:59:54,667
So I thought, maybe
I could become a writer too.

990
00:59:54,723 --> 00:59:55,724
Wow!

991
00:59:55,791 --> 00:59:58,294
I don't have a cool
back story like you.

992
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:00,506
It's just“
As a kid, I used to watch Dad

993
01:00:00,562 --> 01:00:02,200
He never had time for anyone.

994
01:00:02,264 --> 01:00:03,470
Not even himself.

995
01:00:03,532 --> 01:00:05,273
He was successful, but,

996
01:00:05,734 --> 01:00:07,213
You know,

997
01:00:07,636 --> 01:00:11,140
...I wanted to taste life,
you know what I mean?

998
01:00:12,141 --> 01:00:14,678
I tried starting my own rock band.

999
01:00:14,743 --> 01:00:16,723
But that was hard work too.

1000
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:19,589
That's when I realized I
should be a writer.

1001
01:00:20,182 --> 01:00:22,560
How's your life of leisure
working out for you these days?

1002
01:00:22,618 --> 01:00:26,532
I'm broke!
I have to work now. No choice.

1003
01:00:27,723 --> 01:00:31,569
Trouble is, I can't write.
- You've forgotten how to work?

1004
01:00:31,627 --> 01:00:34,767
It's writer's block! - More like
a mental block, don't you think?

1005
01:00:36,432 --> 01:00:38,105
Can I ask you something?

1006
01:00:38,567 --> 01:00:40,843
How do you write these love stories?

1007
01:00:41,136 --> 01:00:44,379
You don't even believe in them.
- How do you know?

1008
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:46,716
Maybe deep inside, I'm romantic?I

1009
01:00:56,452 --> 01:01:01,424
So Yudi's life is just like
a romantic comedy now.

1010
01:01:01,757 --> 01:01:03,430
Soo sweet!

1011
01:01:04,293 --> 01:01:07,797
Correct. In this big wide world,
we bumped into each other!

1012
01:01:07,863 --> 01:01:10,605
You didn't bump into her,
you stalked her!

1013
01:01:11,467 --> 01:01:12,810
We're a nice combination.

1014
01:01:12,868 --> 01:01:14,541
She's hot. I'm cool.

1015
01:01:14,603 --> 01:01:17,607
She's romantic on the inside,
I'm romantic on the outside.

1016
01:01:17,673 --> 01:01:19,311
She's young, I'm young.

1017
01:01:21,677 --> 01:01:23,247
Shut up, I'm not old.

1018
01:01:25,114 --> 01:01:26,092
Okay, young at heart!

1019
01:01:29,151 --> 01:01:32,394
Anyway, everything's perfect.
- Actually“

1020
01:01:32,454 --> 01:01:34,456
This is going too smooth.

1021
01:01:35,324 --> 01:01:37,770
Something's going to give somewhere.
- Shut up!

1022
01:01:37,826 --> 01:01:41,774
What?
- She could be engaged. Married.

1023
01:01:41,830 --> 01:01:43,207
Pregnant.

1024
01:01:43,265 --> 01:01:46,678
And if it's a serious film,
she could be terminally ill. - What?!

1025
01:01:47,503 --> 01:01:48,846
That doesn't always happen.

1026
01:01:48,904 --> 01:01:51,111
It does. Almost all the time.

1027
01:01:51,173 --> 01:01:52,481
It's a requirement.

1028
01:01:57,780 --> 01:02:00,784
Hey, what's up?
- Nothing!

1029
01:02:00,849 --> 01:02:04,422
Just thought I'd say hi.
- Okay? Hi, Yudi.

1030
01:02:07,589 --> 01:02:08,795
Are you married?

1031
01:02:09,358 --> 01:02:10,166
What?

1032
01:02:10,225 --> 01:02:11,795
No. I knew it.

1033
01:02:12,094 --> 01:02:15,735
Did you call me to ask that?
- No. I just called.

1034
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:20,406
And, you aren't engaged, are you?

1035
01:02:20,469 --> 01:02:22,813
Have you seen a ring on my finger?
- No.

1036
01:02:22,871 --> 01:02:26,341
You could've hidden it also, like Montu.
- Who's Montu?

1037
01:02:26,408 --> 01:02:28,319
What are you blabbering about?

1038
01:02:29,411 --> 01:02:32,790
You don't have a boyfriend, do you?
- No, Yudi. I don't have any boyfriend.

1039
01:02:32,848 --> 01:02:34,350
I knew ill

1040
01:02:34,716 --> 01:02:37,788
Any critical“

1041
01:02:38,887 --> 01:02:41,367
Uh, you're healthy overall, right?
- What the!

1042
01:02:41,423 --> 01:02:42,800
Good, good. Done.

1043
01:02:43,125 --> 01:02:45,162
Any more questions?

1044
01:02:46,128 --> 01:02:47,129
What?

1045
01:02:47,429 --> 01:02:49,136
Okay call you later bye!

1046
01:02:51,233 --> 01:02:53,713
Well? - You didn't
ask all the questions.

1047
01:02:54,169 --> 01:02:56,240
Will you accept her if
she's carrying someone else's sin

1048
01:02:56,305 --> 01:02:58,080
...in her stomach?

1049
01:02:58,674 --> 01:03:00,551
Shut up!
- Just asking.

1050
01:03:01,710 --> 01:03:03,087
So,

1051
01:03:03,479 --> 01:03:05,686
“situation normal.
- Impossible.

1052
01:03:05,747 --> 01:03:09,422
Every story has something
happening right about at this point.

1053
01:03:11,386 --> 01:03:12,729
When?
- Now.

1054
01:03:20,662 --> 01:03:23,438
Now?
- Almost.

1055
01:03:34,610 --> 01:03:35,611
Now?

1056
01:03:58,870 --> 01:03:59,814
What happened to you?

1057
01:04:00,305 --> 01:04:02,808
This.. was.. a small accident.

1058
01:04:02,874 --> 01:04:05,184
Wasn't an accident. It's an allergy.

1059
01:04:05,444 --> 01:04:07,720
All this stuff around my face?
These foreigners overdo things.

1060
01:04:07,779 --> 01:04:09,087
Give me a few days. I'll be fine.

1061
01:04:09,147 --> 01:04:10,785
What do you got?
Write something?

1062
01:04:10,849 --> 01:04:13,125
No, I'll.. finish it soon.

1063
01:04:16,354 --> 01:04:17,890
I have a new idea.

1064
01:04:21,860 --> 01:04:24,431
What's this?
- It's all his genius.

1065
01:04:25,731 --> 01:04:26,971
Thing about me is,

1066
01:04:27,766 --> 01:04:28,904
...I'm a method actor.

1067
01:04:29,201 --> 01:04:30,441
I've done my homework.

1068
01:04:30,869 --> 01:04:33,145
I've marked the
best scenes in these films.

1069
01:04:33,205 --> 01:04:35,913
Use the ones you think
are right for the script.

1070
01:04:35,974 --> 01:04:38,784
This way, no one will ever
be able to tell..

1071
01:04:38,844 --> 01:04:40,687
...which film we copied it from.

1072
01:04:41,213 --> 01:04:42,886
You mean you watched
all these films“

1073
01:04:42,948 --> 01:04:45,224
“and marked every scene you liked?
- He saw them.

1074
01:04:46,284 --> 01:04:47,786
I understood them.

1075
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:51,329
So. Knock yourself out
inserting these scenes.

1076
01:04:51,690 --> 01:04:54,398
Armaanji, I think we should
try something different.

1077
01:04:54,459 --> 01:04:55,904
What is different?

1078
01:04:55,961 --> 01:04:56,962
No matter how different
you try to be..

1079
01:04:57,028 --> 01:04:58,632
“People watch what they like.

1080
01:05:00,799 --> 01:05:02,745
Okay, just give me one week.

1081
01:05:03,001 --> 01:05:05,003
I promise you,
your mind will be blown.

1082
01:05:05,070 --> 01:05:06,811
He doesn't get it.

1083
01:05:06,872 --> 01:05:08,249
He doesn't get it.

1084
01:05:12,778 --> 01:05:13,722
Look here.

1085
01:05:18,817 --> 01:05:22,287
This look? There's 10 pages
of dialogue coming.

1086
01:05:24,456 --> 01:05:25,764
Can you hear them?

1087
01:05:26,458 --> 01:05:27,960
Hold ill

1088
01:05:31,296 --> 01:05:32,366
Wide shot!

1089
01:05:32,430 --> 01:05:34,808
Jimmy, jimmy,
jimmy, jimmy, jimmy, close!

1090
01:05:34,866 --> 01:05:37,278
Wide again! Cut to song.

1091
01:05:39,037 --> 01:05:40,311
That's how you write scripts.

1092
01:05:40,372 --> 01:05:41,874
Sir?
- Not yet.

1093
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:44,311
There was a time when..

1094
01:05:44,910 --> 01:05:46,184
...whatever I said
was the script.

1095
01:05:46,244 --> 01:05:48,884
If I didn't? Pause.

1096
01:05:49,181 --> 01:05:50,956
If I was having an
affair with the heroine?

1097
01:05:51,249 --> 01:05:52,159
Pregnant pause!

1098
01:05:53,351 --> 01:05:54,352
Screw it. Do your thing.

1099
01:05:54,753 --> 01:05:55,788
I don't like interfering anyway.

1100
01:05:56,288 --> 01:06:00,168
I'm just sharing these ideas so..

1101
01:06:00,225 --> 01:06:02,034
...you don't write a boring script.
- No, no.

1102
01:06:02,093 --> 01:06:03,265
It is a romcom.

1103
01:06:03,328 --> 01:06:04,136
Remedy.

1104
01:06:04,196 --> 01:06:06,403
But it should be a bit hard hitting.

1105
01:06:06,464 --> 01:06:07,807
Intense.

1106
01:06:07,866 --> 01:06:10,369
Life is hard hitting and intense too.

1107
01:06:10,702 --> 01:06:12,204
Do all of that
on your own time.

1108
01:06:12,270 --> 01:06:15,149
Sir, I just don't want
the script to be cheesy.

1109
01:06:15,207 --> 01:06:16,277
Cheesy?

1110
01:06:16,708 --> 01:06:18,153
Understand this truth.

1111
01:06:18,210 --> 01:06:20,417
In this world, every boy is naive“.

1112
01:06:20,478 --> 01:06:23,288
...every girl is insecure,
and we're all cheesy in real life.

1113
01:06:23,715 --> 01:06:24,921
People go to the theaters“

1114
01:06:24,983 --> 01:06:27,190
...with their family and a tub
of popcorn. Don't waste their money.

1115
01:06:27,252 --> 01:06:29,163
Everything should be spectacular.
And happy.

1116
01:06:29,487 --> 01:06:31,763
Let the hero and heroine run
into each others arms.

1117
01:06:32,057 --> 01:06:33,263
Let there be slow-motions.

1118
01:06:33,325 --> 01:06:35,828
Let there be sunset.
If it rains, let it.

1119
01:06:35,894 --> 01:06:37,305
If it songs play, let them.

1120
01:06:37,362 --> 01:06:39,069
Why, if they want to kiss, let them!

1121
01:06:39,130 --> 01:06:40,438
These days,
the Censors aren't an issue.

1122
01:06:40,498 --> 01:06:41,977
People should be happy.

1123
01:06:42,033 --> 01:06:44,035
Don't get stuck in your creativity.

1124
01:06:44,102 --> 01:06:46,981
Don't give life lessons
for 300 rupees.

1125
01:06:52,377 --> 01:06:54,050
There's no more, Sir.

1126
01:07:01,319 --> 01:07:03,196
Let's write quietly for one hour.

1127
01:07:03,255 --> 01:07:05,360
You write yours, I'll write mine.

1128
01:07:05,690 --> 01:07:07,226
I don't have anything like this.

1129
01:07:07,692 --> 01:07:09,069
Can I borrow your dolly?

1130
01:07:09,361 --> 01:07:10,669
Absolutely not.

1131
01:07:10,729 --> 01:07:12,868
That's my lucky charm.
Don't touch it.

1132
01:07:13,365 --> 01:07:14,343
Fine.

1133
01:07:31,917 --> 01:07:34,761
Can you type a little slower?
You're giving me a complex.

1134
01:07:34,819 --> 01:07:36,355
Focus.

1135
01:07:36,721 --> 01:07:38,029
I can't do this.

1136
01:07:39,057 --> 01:07:41,230
Try! It hasn't even been 5 minutes.

1137
01:07:41,293 --> 01:07:42,738
I need inspiration.

1138
01:07:44,696 --> 01:07:46,073
Isn't this enough?

1139
01:07:46,731 --> 01:07:47,766
I have an idea.

1140
01:07:49,034 --> 01:07:49,910
What is it?

1141
01:07:49,968 --> 01:07:51,276
You're off to 'Frisco tomorrow,
right? - Yeah?

1142
01:07:51,336 --> 01:07:53,373
Let's drive there.
- Why?

1143
01:07:53,672 --> 01:07:56,016
Because you haven't seen
the Pacific Coast Highway.

1144
01:07:56,074 --> 01:07:58,748
And maybe I'll find my
inspiration driving.

1145
01:07:59,144 --> 01:08:02,023
But my flight and hotel have
been booked. - So?

1146
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:03,081
Get them canceled.

1147
01:08:03,148 --> 01:08:04,957
Think about it.

1148
01:08:05,016 --> 01:08:06,051
The coast on one side.

1149
01:08:06,117 --> 01:08:07,721
Open skies on the other.

1150
01:08:07,786 --> 01:08:09,823
And me, in the middle of it all!

1151
01:08:09,888 --> 01:08:12,334
No. I have a reading
day after morning.

1152
01:08:12,390 --> 01:08:13,869
I'm not taking any risk.

1153
01:08:13,925 --> 01:08:17,771
Baby, I am risk-free.
I come with a guarantee.

1154
01:08:20,165 --> 01:08:22,805
Are you sure this is a good idea?
- Absolutely.

1155
01:08:22,867 --> 01:08:25,074
We'll head out in the morning,
reach by sundown,

1156
01:08:25,136 --> 01:08:27,241
“and you can make it for your
reading the next morning.

1157
01:08:27,806 --> 01:08:28,750
Come on.

1158
01:08:29,708 --> 01:08:31,244
Fine.
- Done.

1159
01:08:31,309 --> 01:08:33,380
But we'll start early.
- Absolutely.

1160
01:08:33,778 --> 01:08:34,813
Early morning.

1161
01:08:43,288 --> 01:08:44,790
Finally!

1162
01:08:45,223 --> 01:08:46,725
You call this early morning?

1163
01:08:46,791 --> 01:08:48,361
It's not morning yet.

1164
01:08:48,793 --> 01:08:52,002
You've calling me like
a psycho from 6 am!

1165
01:08:52,063 --> 01:08:53,872
You said we'd leave early morning.

1166
01:08:53,932 --> 01:08:57,641
Early is 11 or 12,
after a nice long breakfast.

1167
01:09:02,874 --> 01:09:04,148
What's with all this luggage?

1168
01:09:04,209 --> 01:09:05,950
Planning to settle down there?

1169
01:09:06,011 --> 01:09:07,354
What? This is just basic stuff.

1170
01:09:07,779 --> 01:09:09,122
You should've brought
some porters along.

1171
01:09:09,180 --> 01:09:10,659
Don't be such a big baby.

1172
01:09:22,293 --> 01:09:23,704
Really?

1173
01:09:25,730 --> 01:09:27,869
Your Highness!
- Thank you.

1174
01:09:27,932 --> 01:09:29,275
Thank you.

1175
01:09:41,913 --> 01:09:43,153
Wow!

1176
01:09:43,782 --> 01:09:45,227
This is so beautiful!

1177
01:09:45,650 --> 01:09:47,186
If this doesn't inspire you..

1178
01:09:47,252 --> 01:09:49,357
...you should just quit writing.

1179
01:09:49,421 --> 01:09:50,661
You're welcome.

1180
01:09:50,989 --> 01:09:52,900
And you wanted to fly alone.

1181
01:09:52,957 --> 01:09:55,301
All we need is some background
music to go with this scene.

1182
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:56,600
Sure.

1183
01:09:58,930 --> 01:09:59,965
Oh man.

1184
01:10:00,031 --> 01:10:00,873
What?

1185
01:10:02,067 --> 01:10:03,637
No, this is not nice.

1186
01:10:06,171 --> 01:10:07,616
No way“

1187
01:10:08,373 --> 01:10:12,719
"It's not the flu or fever.."

1188
01:10:12,977 --> 01:10:15,981
"He's just."

1189
01:10:16,047 --> 01:10:19,654
"Down with love."

1190
01:10:19,951 --> 01:10:23,330
"Down with love."

1191
01:10:23,721 --> 01:10:25,667
"The black eyes."

1192
01:10:27,292 --> 01:10:29,932
"The fair cheeks."

1193
01:10:31,162 --> 01:10:33,142
"The sultry gaze."

1194
01:10:35,066 --> 01:10:37,068
"The enticing gait."

1195
01:10:37,135 --> 01:10:40,082
"Why did you break my heart."

1196
01:10:41,272 --> 01:10:44,219
"Why did we fall in love."

1197
01:10:45,310 --> 01:10:47,984
"Why did you go away.."

1198
01:10:48,046 --> 01:10:49,753
"Away...Away.."

1199
01:10:49,814 --> 01:10:51,316
<i>“Come..“'</i>

1200
01:10:53,218 --> 01:10:55,858
"Shower me with your love.."

1201
01:10:57,322 --> 01:10:59,359
Give it to me!
- Stop it Yudi.

1202
01:11:01,860 --> 01:11:03,965
"What's behind the veil."

1203
01:11:04,028 --> 01:11:06,269
"Behind the veil.."

1204
01:11:06,664 --> 01:11:08,803
"What's behind the veil."

1205
01:11:08,867 --> 01:11:10,778
"Behind the veil.."

1206
01:11:10,835 --> 01:11:13,714
"My heart's behind my veil.."

1207
01:11:13,771 --> 01:11:16,980
"Every time I see a girl,
my crazy heart goes.."

1208
01:11:17,041 --> 01:11:20,318
"Ole...Ole...Ole.."

1209
01:11:20,712 --> 01:11:24,182
"I sway,
dance and sing the song of love."

1210
01:11:24,249 --> 01:11:27,355
"Ole...Ole...Ole.."

1211
01:11:50,041 --> 01:11:52,180
Aah! Nonsense!

1212
01:11:52,243 --> 01:11:53,916
Nonsense!

1213
01:11:54,746 --> 01:11:56,692
You Idiot.

1214
01:11:57,415 --> 01:11:59,361
Are you okay?
- What happened?

1215
01:12:00,151 --> 01:12:03,030
I feel asleep.
- You fell asleep at the wheel?

1216
01:12:03,087 --> 01:12:05,829
Hold you, please don't sleep.
- So it's my fault?

1217
01:12:05,890 --> 01:12:06,732
Of course.

1218
01:12:06,791 --> 01:12:09,362
First, you wake me up
at <i>6</i> like some school teacher.

1219
01:12:09,694 --> 01:12:10,832
And then happily dazed off.

1220
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:17,339
Nonsense! It's not starting.

1221
01:12:17,402 --> 01:12:18,346
Engine must be flooded.

1222
01:12:18,670 --> 01:12:19,705
What now?

1223
01:12:19,771 --> 01:12:22,342
I'll call AAA.
They'll gel us out of here quickly.

1224
01:12:22,407 --> 01:12:24,887
Oh God, we'll be very late.
- No, we won't.

1225
01:12:24,943 --> 01:12:27,150
I'll get you there by tonight,
I promise.

1226
01:12:27,212 --> 01:12:28,282
Y!

1227
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:29,715
Y!

1228
01:12:30,148 --> 01:12:31,650
No, I'm not asking why.

1229
01:12:31,716 --> 01:12:34,322
I am saying Y. My name is Yudi.

1230
01:12:34,385 --> 01:12:35,989
Y for Yahoo.

1231
01:12:36,054 --> 01:12:37,727
U for Underwear.

1232
01:12:37,989 --> 01:12:39,332
U for Unicorn.

1233
01:12:42,927 --> 01:12:43,997
What did they say?

1234
01:12:44,395 --> 01:12:46,033
It'll lake at least 4 hours.

1235
01:12:46,097 --> 01:12:47,337
4 hours?

1236
01:12:47,732 --> 01:12:50,008
I can't believe I
made such a huge mistake.

1237
01:12:50,068 --> 01:12:51,342
This was such a bad idea.

1238
01:12:51,669 --> 01:12:53,239
As long as you had the wind
on your face, everything was fine.

1239
01:12:53,304 --> 01:12:55,011
At the first sign of trouble,
it became a bad idea?

1240
01:12:55,073 --> 01:12:56,347
I canceled my nice,
comfortable flight!

1241
01:12:56,407 --> 01:12:57,909
If the pilot had fallen asleep“

1242
01:12:57,976 --> 01:12:59,250
“you wouldn't even get
a chance to argue like this!

1243
01:12:59,310 --> 01:13:02,814
Yudi, you do realize we could've died!
- Don't be so dramatic.

1244
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:05,724
Whoa, I'm being dramatic now!
- Of course!

1245
01:13:06,684 --> 01:13:08,163
We should get a lift.

1246
01:13:17,996 --> 01:13:19,168
I can't believe this!

1247
01:13:19,230 --> 01:13:21,141
No one wants to help!

1248
01:13:21,199 --> 01:13:22,109
Wait.

1249
01:13:27,205 --> 01:13:28,650
What are you doing?

1250
01:13:29,274 --> 01:13:30,912
What are you doing?

1251
01:13:30,975 --> 01:13:32,010
Take off your shirt.

1252
01:13:32,277 --> 01:13:33,187
What?I

1253
01:13:33,244 --> 01:13:35,190
Your face can't be seen
in the distance.

1254
01:13:35,246 --> 01:13:37,248
You'll need to show your body.
- No way.

1255
01:13:38,349 --> 01:13:39,828
Your wish.

1256
01:13:47,058 --> 01:13:49,129
Come on! Somebody?

1257
01:13:49,927 --> 01:13:51,167
Arch your back!

1258
01:13:52,897 --> 01:13:54,899
Stomach in, chest out!

1259
01:13:55,166 --> 01:13:57,271
Chest out!
- It is out, Yudi.

1260
01:13:57,335 --> 01:13:59,076
You need a sexy pose.

1261
01:14:00,405 --> 01:14:01,907
Sexier!

1262
01:14:03,174 --> 01:14:05,154
That's good, That's nice.

1263
01:14:06,377 --> 01:14:07,720
Nice.

1264
01:14:08,012 --> 01:14:09,855
And turn around slowly.

1265
01:14:09,914 --> 01:14:11,291
Slowly, slowly!

1266
01:14:11,349 --> 01:14:12,293
Shut up, Yudi.

1267
01:14:13,184 --> 01:14:14,288
Okay, it's networking.

1268
01:14:14,352 --> 01:14:16,662
Tell you what, take the top off.

1269
01:14:19,157 --> 01:14:20,864
What the hell are you doing there?

1270
01:14:20,925 --> 01:14:24,065
Get up.
I think you'll do better than me.

1271
01:14:24,429 --> 01:14:27,967
Take it off. Why are you covering?
- Are you mad?

1272
01:14:28,466 --> 01:14:31,140
Take it off, Yudi. Show your chest.

1273
01:14:31,202 --> 01:14:33,944
Stick it out a little bit.
- Yeah!

1274
01:14:34,806 --> 01:14:36,149
Nice.

1275
01:14:41,379 --> 01:14:42,915
<i>'Flew You need a ride?</i>

1276
01:14:44,782 --> 01:14:47,023
No, no. Please go. It's okay.

1277
01:14:47,085 --> 01:14:48,393
Thank you.

1278
01:14:48,453 --> 01:14:50,626
Idiot!

1279
01:14:53,925 --> 01:14:56,064
He called you an idiot!

1280
01:15:02,433 --> 01:15:03,707
Finally!

1281
01:15:12,243 --> 01:15:13,688
You from India?

1282
01:15:15,113 --> 01:15:16,148
Yeah.

1283
01:15:16,214 --> 01:15:19,718
Girlfriend?
- No! We're just friends.

1284
01:15:20,084 --> 01:15:21,427
Just friend!

1285
01:15:25,423 --> 01:15:26,697
Tell him, Yudi.

1286
01:15:27,091 --> 01:15:29,298
I have 'just friend'.
- Yeah?

1287
01:15:30,862 --> 01:15:31,897
Shut up, Yudi.

1288
01:15:32,797 --> 01:15:34,037
How much longer?

1289
01:15:34,899 --> 01:15:36,003
2 minutes!

1290
01:15:39,504 --> 01:15:40,881
15 minutes.

1291
01:15:46,010 --> 01:15:47,785
20-25 minutes!

1292
01:16:11,002 --> 01:16:11,980
Thanks.

1293
01:16:14,705 --> 01:16:18,278
So sweet“
- The perfect Facebook moment.

1294
01:16:18,342 --> 01:16:20,253
Yay, I'm finally married!

1295
01:16:20,311 --> 01:16:23,383
Hubby and wifey forever! I love you!

1296
01:16:23,448 --> 01:16:24,756
Heart, heart, heart.

1297
01:16:25,049 --> 01:16:27,427
At least 15 Comments and 100 Likes.

1298
01:16:27,752 --> 01:16:29,425
"What a lovely couple you guys make."

1299
01:16:29,754 --> 01:16:31,665
"You guys are perfect
for each other."

1300
01:16:32,857 --> 01:16:37,397
What do you think? 3 years?
- Nah. 1 year tops.

1301
01:16:38,029 --> 01:16:39,702
First 3 months will be
ruled by hormones.

1302
01:16:40,131 --> 01:16:41,735
Next 3 by realization...

1303
01:16:41,799 --> 01:16:43,278
“and the following
3 by frustration.

1304
01:16:43,334 --> 01:16:45,940
By the first anniversary,
they'll be at war.

1305
01:16:46,337 --> 01:16:48,681
"Give me my space!"
"I don't like your mother!"

1306
01:16:48,739 --> 01:16:49,683
"What's wrong with my mother?"

1307
01:16:49,740 --> 01:16:51,117
"I hate you.
I don't want to talk to you."

1308
01:16:51,175 --> 01:16:52,916
"Eff you!" "Eff you!"

1309
01:16:54,312 --> 01:16:55,723
Hey, that groom looks..

1310
01:16:55,780 --> 01:16:57,760
“Just like the hero from
one of your books.

1311
01:16:57,815 --> 01:16:59,795
If I ever run into
the hero of my book..

1312
01:16:59,851 --> 01:17:01,125
...I'll knock him out.

1313
01:17:01,185 --> 01:17:04,826
I don't get it. Every girl talks
about equality and independence.

1314
01:17:04,889 --> 01:17:07,096
And yet all of them want“.

1315
01:17:07,158 --> 01:17:08,796
...their prince charming
to swoop in and rescue them.

1316
01:17:08,860 --> 01:17:09,964
Complete them.

1317
01:17:10,027 --> 01:17:11,768
Change their life.

1318
01:17:12,196 --> 01:17:13,698
Doesn't make sense, right?

1319
01:17:13,998 --> 01:17:15,705
Then why do you write
those books?

1320
01:17:16,133 --> 01:17:18,636
What difference does it make
if I write or not?

1321
01:17:20,371 --> 01:17:22,715
Dude, you're a bit off!

1322
01:17:27,845 --> 01:17:28,823
What?

1323
01:17:29,981 --> 01:17:33,258
You and me, we won't last <i>6</i> months.
- <i>6</i> months?

1324
01:17:33,317 --> 01:17:36,389
We can't last <i>6</i> hours.

1325
01:17:36,888 --> 01:17:38,868
An whole lifetime
is out of the question.

1326
01:17:39,857 --> 01:17:40,699
Perfect.

1327
01:17:43,194 --> 01:17:44,332
Cheers to that.

1328
01:18:01,245 --> 01:18:04,021
What? Why didn't you
book a room for yourself?

1329
01:18:04,081 --> 01:18:05,219
I didn't“

1330
01:18:05,283 --> 01:18:08,355
Where did you plan on sleeping?
- I don't know.

1331
01:18:08,686 --> 01:18:10,996
I don't think that far ahead.
- Yudi!

1332
01:18:11,722 --> 01:18:13,929
I thought you were on top
of the arrangements.

1333
01:18:15,259 --> 01:18:16,863
I handled the travel.

1334
01:18:19,697 --> 01:18:22,143
Are you really sure you
don't have any extra rooms?

1335
01:18:22,199 --> 01:18:24,645
Sorry, ma'am. We're fully booked.

1336
01:18:24,969 --> 01:18:26,846
This has to happen.

1337
01:18:29,941 --> 01:18:31,352
Enjoy your stay-

1338
01:18:31,876 --> 01:18:34,288
I can't believe I'm forced
to share a room with you.

1339
01:18:34,345 --> 01:18:36,382
Come on, we're adults. We'll manage.

1340
01:18:36,747 --> 01:18:39,023
I'm an adult,
I can't say the same about you.

1341
01:18:47,692 --> 01:18:49,171
So listen. I'll lake the bed“

1342
01:18:49,226 --> 01:18:51,331
“and you take the couch.

1343
01:18:52,997 --> 01:18:57,343
You know, I have a bad back.
I can't sleep on the couch.

1344
01:18:57,768 --> 01:18:59,805
So I should sleep on the couch?
- No.

1345
01:19:00,938 --> 01:19:02,008
You don't have to.

1346
01:19:04,709 --> 01:19:05,983
It's a big bed.

1347
01:19:12,350 --> 01:19:14,023
We both can fit in here comfortably.

1348
01:19:14,785 --> 01:19:17,664
Without even touching each other.
I promise.

1349
01:19:21,025 --> 01:19:22,026
No.

1350
01:19:25,396 --> 01:19:28,673
This is ridiculous.
I always sleep on the left side.

1351
01:19:28,733 --> 01:19:31,839
You're on the left,
just in the other direction.

1352
01:19:32,336 --> 01:19:35,283
Hang on a second. This is my room.

1353
01:19:35,339 --> 01:19:38,047
Why should I sleep on this side?
- Don't be selfish.

1354
01:19:38,109 --> 01:19:39,417
Switch!

1355
01:19:39,477 --> 01:19:41,423
Really?
- Yeah!

1356
01:19:45,650 --> 01:19:47,357
Roll over the blanket, Yudi.

1357
01:19:51,188 --> 01:19:53,862
Can you keep your
feet away from my face?

1358
01:19:53,924 --> 01:19:55,130
You too.

1359
01:19:56,260 --> 01:19:59,104
Your feet stink.
- Not more than your face.

1360
01:20:00,064 --> 01:20:01,134
Can you..

1361
01:20:09,807 --> 01:20:10,945
Aanchal.

1362
01:20:13,911 --> 01:20:14,912
Aanchal.

1363
01:20:17,214 --> 01:20:18,318
Aanchal.

1364
01:20:19,016 --> 01:20:20,620
Aanchal.

1365
01:20:22,086 --> 01:20:25,829
Okay, I'm going to
lift your arm in the air.

1366
01:20:26,424 --> 01:20:29,871
If you're asleep,
your arm will slay up.

1367
01:20:30,227 --> 01:20:32,229
Else it will fall down.

1368
01:20:33,197 --> 01:20:34,801
How old are you, Yudi?

1369
01:20:34,865 --> 01:20:37,175
Oh, so you're awake.

1370
01:20:38,102 --> 01:20:40,104
What do you want?
- Nothing.

1371
01:20:41,839 --> 01:20:43,216
I just wanted to apologize.

1372
01:20:45,176 --> 01:20:46,883
You met with an
accident because of me.

1373
01:20:46,944 --> 01:20:49,356
So I'm sorry.

1374
01:20:51,982 --> 01:20:54,326
I shouldn't have
fallen asleep either.

1375
01:20:55,653 --> 01:21:00,898
Sorry, I got carried away
and said too much. - No.

1376
01:21:01,859 --> 01:21:04,032
It was my idea to drive here.

1377
01:21:04,095 --> 01:21:06,336
All I had to do was drop
you here safe and sound.

1378
01:21:06,397 --> 01:21:08,638
Driving here wasn't
a bad idea at all.

1379
01:21:08,899 --> 01:21:10,606
I really enjoyed it.

1380
01:21:11,135 --> 01:21:12,671
Lovely weather, right?

1381
01:21:16,841 --> 01:21:18,013
The room's nice too.

1382
01:21:20,277 --> 01:21:23,656
So is the bed. So soft.

1383
01:21:26,150 --> 01:21:27,652
Should we do something?

1384
01:21:31,355 --> 01:21:32,857
Make out?

1385
01:21:34,225 --> 01:21:35,932
What? I can't hear you?

1386
01:21:36,894 --> 01:21:39,340
I think we should make out.
- I can't hear you, Yudi.

1387
01:21:41,065 --> 01:21:41,770
Let's kiss!

1388
01:21:48,239 --> 01:21:49,877
You didn't have to kick me.

1389
01:21:50,875 --> 01:21:52,582
A polite no would've done fine.

1390
01:22:04,755 --> 01:22:06,632
Uhh, okay.

1391
01:22:06,924 --> 01:22:08,062
Hmm?

1392
01:22:08,125 --> 01:22:09,195
Okay.

1393
01:22:10,795 --> 01:22:11,899
What okay?

1394
01:22:28,846 --> 01:22:30,985
You won't fall in love, right?

1395
01:22:31,415 --> 01:22:33,053
I don't fall in love.

1396
01:22:33,117 --> 01:22:36,929
Good. - And normally,
I usually say this to girls.

1397
01:22:37,221 --> 01:22:39,098
And I can never be so direct.

1398
01:22:39,156 --> 01:22:40,726
All I am saying is“

1399
01:22:41,392 --> 01:22:43,303
...I go back next week“

1400
01:22:44,361 --> 01:22:46,341
I don't want things between us“

1401
01:22:46,964 --> 01:22:49,240
So let's not complicate things.
- No!

1402
01:22:49,300 --> 01:22:51,746
Let's just be in the rnornent.
- Yeah!

1403
01:22:51,802 --> 01:22:53,281
You understand, right?

1404
01:22:53,804 --> 01:22:54,976
No falling in love.

1405
01:22:55,039 --> 01:22:58,282
Just control yourself.
I'm very addictive.

1406
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:05,351
What?
- Should we put on some music?

1407
01:23:17,194 --> 01:23:19,299
I'm sorry.
- You have a big nose.

1408
01:23:19,363 --> 01:23:21,070
You moved your head“.

1409
01:23:21,131 --> 01:23:22,007
Okay.

1410
01:23:22,066 --> 01:23:23,909
Anyway, let's try this again.

1411
01:23:25,236 --> 01:23:26,340
Should we increase the volume?

1412
01:23:26,670 --> 01:23:28,081
Are you going to talk nonstop?

1413
01:23:28,906 --> 01:23:29,907
No!

1414
01:23:35,312 --> 01:23:36,814
Nothing's changed, right?

1415
01:23:37,081 --> 01:23:38,651
Not at all.

1416
01:23:39,049 --> 01:23:41,188
In fact, you seem more irritating.

1417
01:23:44,121 --> 01:23:45,657
Can we sleep properly now?

1418
01:23:49,159 --> 01:23:50,365
What, you mean upside down?

1419
01:24:07,011 --> 01:24:09,048
My face hurts.

1420
01:24:09,113 --> 01:24:11,024
I don't know how many times
you kicked me in your sleep.

1421
01:24:11,448 --> 01:24:13,189
Next time sleep on the couch.

1422
01:24:14,285 --> 01:24:16,162
Tell me. One second, almost ready.

1423
01:24:16,987 --> 01:24:18,261
How do I look?

1424
01:24:19,823 --> 01:24:23,669
Like you worked really hard all night.
- Shut up!

1425
01:24:24,161 --> 01:24:26,835
Relax. It will be fine.

1426
01:24:28,999 --> 01:24:31,878
"To gain something,
you have to lose something."

1427
01:24:32,236 --> 01:24:35,080
"Rena knew it boiled
down to just three words."

1428
01:24:35,139 --> 01:24:37,415
"But did she have the courage
to finally say them aloud.."

1429
01:24:37,474 --> 01:24:41,820
"..to the person who stood
for everything she despised?"

1430
01:24:42,846 --> 01:24:45,884
"In that heartbeat,
she found the courage."

1431
01:24:45,950 --> 01:24:47,952
"So her thoughts were exactly this.."

1432
01:24:48,285 --> 01:24:51,095
"Love me and free my soul."

1433
01:24:51,155 --> 01:24:53,726
"I love you and adore you..."

1434
01:24:53,791 --> 01:24:56,931
"...and I don't know
any other way of living."

1435
01:24:56,994 --> 01:24:59,099
"Of loving!"

1436
01:24:59,697 --> 01:25:04,043
And I counted <i>1</i> yawns,
3 snores and 1 dead person.

1437
01:25:05,202 --> 01:25:09,309
A very senior writer,
friend and philosopher“

1438
01:25:09,707 --> 01:25:12,381
...once said to me,
"People come to book reading.."

1439
01:25:12,710 --> 01:25:14,348
"..to know more about the author."

1440
01:25:14,411 --> 01:25:17,255
So I'm thinking let's
you and me have a conversation.

1441
01:25:17,314 --> 01:25:19,123
Let's just talk. What do you say?

1442
01:25:19,183 --> 01:25:21,220
I have a question for you?
- Yes, sure.

1443
01:25:21,285 --> 01:25:24,061
How close to your personal
life is your writing?

1444
01:25:24,121 --> 01:25:25,691
Have you ever been in love?

1445
01:25:26,991 --> 01:25:31,997
Umm. Let's see. Class
<i>3,</i> Class 1, 12, college..

1446
01:25:32,062 --> 01:25:36,067
Three years ago. Kiran,
Vikram, Hussain, Kkrish and Andy.

1447
01:25:38,035 --> 01:25:40,140
Yes, I have a question.
- Yes.

1448
01:25:40,471 --> 01:25:44,647
Why do you write such conventional
and idealistic love stories?

1449
01:25:45,275 --> 01:25:49,348
Because, our lives are so crowded“

1450
01:25:49,413 --> 01:25:53,122
“and often, love between
two people gets lost in it.

1451
01:25:54,018 --> 01:25:56,760
So I thought there's
one way to save love.

1452
01:25:57,187 --> 01:25:59,724
Write it down in the
pages of a book and sell it.

1453
01:26:00,324 --> 01:26:04,033
What I am trying to say is that love
nowadays is just a four-letter word“

1454
01:26:08,232 --> 01:26:09,370
Thank you!

1455
01:26:15,139 --> 01:26:18,780
"The heart sometimes...confuses me.."

1456
01:26:18,842 --> 01:26:21,982
"And...I'll be really grateful if..."

1457
01:26:24,148 --> 01:26:27,960
"Understand what's
it saying...and tell men"

1458
01:26:28,018 --> 01:26:31,261
"And...I'll be really grateful..."

1459
01:26:33,023 --> 01:26:35,094
"I'll be really grateful.."

1460
01:26:35,159 --> 01:26:37,435
"If you just let
your heart express.."

1461
01:26:37,795 --> 01:26:41,675
"..what you could never say."

1462
01:26:43,801 --> 01:26:50,741
"Just like I am for
you... You're for me."

1463
01:26:53,010 --> 01:27:00,758
"Just like I am for
you... You're for me."

1464
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:21,249
"If we keep meeting...like this.."

1465
01:27:21,305 --> 01:27:24,718
"Love might just seek us out."

1466
01:27:26,009 --> 01:27:28,182
"The heart's deceptive..."

1467
01:27:28,245 --> 01:27:33,923
"Why did it skip a
beat...hearing about it?"

1468
01:27:35,719 --> 01:27:39,758
"It's no longer in my control."

1469
01:27:39,823 --> 01:27:43,100
"Since the heart's stuck on you."

1470
01:27:43,160 --> 01:27:44,867
Let's take a picture?
- Of course.

1471
01:27:44,928 --> 01:27:45,963
Patel Value.

1472
01:27:46,029 --> 01:27:53,777
"Just like I am for you...
You're for me."

1473
01:27:54,972 --> 01:28:02,686
"Just like I am for you...
You're for me."

1474
01:28:03,247 --> 01:28:04,726
Yeah, baby!

1475
01:28:22,699 --> 01:28:23,643
Yudi!

1476
01:28:23,934 --> 01:28:26,175
"I'll be really grateful.."

1477
01:28:28,038 --> 01:28:32,316
"First I request... then miss you.."

1478
01:28:32,709 --> 01:28:36,418
"I think only about you."

1479
01:28:37,214 --> 01:28:39,387
"I don't love you.."

1480
01:28:39,716 --> 01:28:45,598
"..still I always
want you around me."

1481
01:28:46,890 --> 01:28:51,100
"It's nothing...
yet, there's something."

1482
01:28:51,161 --> 01:28:55,007
"Since we met, the heart feels..."

1483
01:28:57,167 --> 01:29:04,642
"Just like I am for you...
You're for me."

1484
01:29:06,443 --> 01:29:12,883
"Just like I am for you...
You're for me."

1485
01:29:15,752 --> 01:29:17,925
<i>you're for me?'</i>

1486
01:29:18,188 --> 01:29:20,896
<i>you're for me?'</i>

1487
01:29:22,326 --> 01:29:25,739
"I'll be really grateful.."

1488
01:29:40,844 --> 01:29:44,053
So, everything fine or not?
- Yes and no.

1489
01:29:44,181 --> 01:29:45,717
Why does this always happen with you?

1490
01:29:45,782 --> 01:29:48,160
First, you were confused
about Vishakha. Now it's Aanchal.

1491
01:29:48,218 --> 01:29:50,198
Shut up, Montu.
There's no confusion this time.

1492
01:29:50,254 --> 01:29:52,734
I suggest you do a full
background check on her.

1493
01:29:52,789 --> 01:29:54,063
If she falls in love with you..

1494
01:29:54,124 --> 01:29:57,333
...it will just spell trouble.
- No chance.

1495
01:29:57,394 --> 01:29:59,374
She's just like me.
- Like you?

1496
01:29:59,796 --> 01:30:03,141
Wow! Then this will be the
best relationship of your life.

1497
01:30:04,101 --> 01:30:04,909
Yeah!

1498
01:30:05,202 --> 01:30:07,341
If she's so smart, why is
she giving you so much attention?

1499
01:30:07,404 --> 01:30:08,906
Let me tell you something.

1500
01:30:08,972 --> 01:30:11,043
Girls love projects.

1501
01:30:11,108 --> 01:30:13,145
And what better project than me?

1502
01:30:13,810 --> 01:30:15,721
That's true.
That's very true.

1503
01:30:16,446 --> 01:30:17,754
Aanchal.

1504
01:30:18,682 --> 01:30:20,218
Hey, what's happening?

1505
01:30:20,984 --> 01:30:23,965
Nothing, I'm free.
- Hey! You're not free, okay?

1506
01:30:25,289 --> 01:30:27,200
Do what?
- Have a drink with me.

1507
01:30:27,257 --> 01:30:28,759
Done.
We'll meet at 9.

1508
01:30:28,825 --> 01:30:29,803
Yudi, don't go
- Bye.

1509
01:30:29,860 --> 01:30:31,362
Don't go, Yudi! Yudi, what the hell!

1510
01:30:31,928 --> 01:30:32,906
You know how tough it's been“

1511
01:30:32,963 --> 01:30:34,704
“to get permission to go out“

1512
01:30:34,765 --> 01:30:35,402
I won't be able to do this“

1513
01:30:35,699 --> 01:30:36,837
“after I become a father.

1514
01:30:36,900 --> 01:30:37,935
Please let me go.

1515
01:30:38,001 --> 01:30:40,140
Aanchal's leaving tomorrow.
It's her farewell dinner.

1516
01:30:40,704 --> 01:30:42,342
Tomorrow on, we're together.
- Fine, go.

1517
01:30:42,639 --> 01:30:44,312
I know you don't love me.
- Semi“

1518
01:30:44,374 --> 01:30:47,082
Vicky, could you keep an
eye on my friend, please?

1519
01:30:47,144 --> 01:30:48,282
He's very depressed.

1520
01:30:48,645 --> 01:30:52,821
Sweetheart, why so sad?
- Married, thank you.

1521
01:31:01,158 --> 01:31:02,694
Almost done.

1522
01:31:03,293 --> 01:31:06,274
Just two more minutes.
One more minute.

1523
01:31:06,863 --> 01:31:10,811
Yeah. So what were you saying?

1524
01:31:12,869 --> 01:31:16,112
So. Suddenly,
in the middle of the jungle“

1525
01:31:17,074 --> 01:31:18,075
Oh man!

1526
01:31:18,141 --> 01:31:19,711
Sorry!

1527
01:31:21,211 --> 01:31:23,657
And I left poor Montu alone for this?

1528
01:31:23,714 --> 01:31:24,954
Flight details“

1529
01:31:27,918 --> 01:31:29,192
Almost done.

1530
01:31:29,252 --> 01:31:30,162
Done.

1531
01:31:31,722 --> 01:31:34,225
So, tell me.
- Forget it.

1532
01:31:34,291 --> 01:31:35,861
Oh come on, tell me.

1533
01:31:36,226 --> 01:31:38,137
I'm listening. Really!

1534
01:31:40,731 --> 01:31:44,304
Okay, so suddenly,
in the middle of the jungle,

1535
01:31:44,634 --> 01:31:47,877
...a tiger? Or a bear?

1536
01:31:49,339 --> 01:31:50,977
Dinosaur?

1537
01:31:51,041 --> 01:31:52,611
Okay, let's say it was an elephant.

1538
01:31:52,943 --> 01:31:55,082
Suddenly he saw that an ele...

1539
01:31:57,781 --> 01:31:58,782
Yudi, my phone!

1540
01:31:58,849 --> 01:32:01,227
Yudi..
Yudi, I need the“

1541
01:32:06,223 --> 01:32:07,133
I'm sorry.

1542
01:32:21,004 --> 01:32:22,039
Sorry!

1543
01:32:26,109 --> 01:32:27,952
No! No!

1544
01:33:09,686 --> 01:33:11,256
Did this belong to
one of your ex-girlfriends?

1545
01:33:11,655 --> 01:33:13,191
But she's not here.
You can wear them.

1546
01:33:13,256 --> 01:33:15,258
No, I don't want them.

1547
01:33:15,325 --> 01:33:16,736
Fine, you come out as you are.

1548
01:33:16,793 --> 01:33:18,636
I love a naked girl in my bedroom.

1549
01:33:26,670 --> 01:33:27,842
What's all this?

1550
01:33:27,904 --> 01:33:30,714
Don't touch anything, please!

1551
01:33:36,179 --> 01:33:39,285
Wow! You wrote these?

1552
01:33:39,349 --> 01:33:42,387
Yes. Once upon a time,
I used to be a writer.

1553
01:33:48,058 --> 01:33:51,130
Why haven't you completed any of it?
- Couldn't find happy endings.

1554
01:33:51,194 --> 01:33:53,640
Not every story needs a happy ending.

1555
01:33:53,897 --> 01:33:55,137
Not bad.

1556
01:33:55,699 --> 01:33:56,973
You do work hard.

1557
01:33:57,033 --> 01:33:58,273
It's bad for my image.

1558
01:33:58,335 --> 01:34:00,679
Keep them back, please.
- Fine.

1559
01:34:00,737 --> 01:34:03,183
And please don't tell anyone.

1560
01:34:10,347 --> 01:34:13,692
Can you play,
or is it just to strike a pose?

1561
01:34:14,017 --> 01:34:16,691
Of course. I'm not a total fake.

1562
01:34:16,753 --> 01:34:18,755
Really? I wonder.

1563
01:34:20,891 --> 01:34:24,134
Actually,
I always wanted to be a rockstar.

1564
01:34:24,194 --> 01:34:26,231
Yeah, I've heard that story.

1565
01:34:27,497 --> 01:34:30,000
So sing something.
- Now?

1566
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:33,006
No. I feel shy.

1567
01:34:33,069 --> 01:34:35,140
Why? Don't know how?

1568
01:34:35,505 --> 01:34:38,418
I'm a legend.
The world just never got it.

1569
01:34:38,475 --> 01:34:39,749
Really?

1570
01:34:40,944 --> 01:34:42,389
Ready?

1571
01:34:52,088 --> 01:34:54,090
Wow!
- I wrote that song in..

1572
01:34:54,157 --> 01:34:56,068
Okay, it's Led Zeppelin.

1573
01:34:57,027 --> 01:35:00,702
Yeah. But seriously. Anything.

1574
01:35:01,831 --> 01:35:05,779
"I was 16...and she was beautiful.."

1575
01:35:05,835 --> 01:35:08,975
And I bought this
guitar to impress her.

1576
01:35:09,739 --> 01:35:11,275
Very impressed.
- Thank you.

1577
01:35:11,341 --> 01:35:13,912
So...was she impressed?
- No.

1578
01:35:13,977 --> 01:35:15,957
And I bought this
guitar for no reason.

1579
01:35:16,379 --> 01:35:17,255
Funny.

1580
01:35:17,314 --> 01:35:19,954
Okay, seriously.
- Seriously.

1581
01:35:24,087 --> 01:35:25,998
I don't remember it, but“
- But“.

1582
01:35:26,456 --> 01:35:28,163
What are the words?

1583
01:35:31,795 --> 01:35:34,298
"It was in one of the drawers."

1584
01:35:34,731 --> 01:35:37,371
"It was right here...
but now it's lost."

1585
01:35:37,434 --> 01:35:40,278
"It shouldn't have happened."

1586
01:35:40,337 --> 01:35:43,113
"My heart's gone missing."

1587
01:35:43,173 --> 01:35:46,086
"My senses were a bit dusty."

1588
01:35:46,142 --> 01:35:48,918
"That was my only fault."

1589
01:35:48,979 --> 01:35:51,823
"Let it be...what's gone, is gone."

1590
01:35:51,881 --> 01:35:53,724
"It was useless anyway."

1591
01:35:53,783 --> 01:35:58,323
"Welcome...my beloved."

1592
01:35:59,389 --> 01:36:01,767
"My heart...
- It's your punishment."

1593
01:36:01,825 --> 01:36:05,034
Are you sure you can't stay for few
more days? - I wish I could!

1594
01:36:06,062 --> 01:36:10,977
"Welcome...my beloved."

1595
01:36:11,301 --> 01:36:16,341
"Welcome...my beloved."

1596
01:36:16,806 --> 01:36:22,313
"Welcome...my beloved."

1597
01:36:22,746 --> 01:36:26,694
"Welcome...my beloved."

1598
01:36:37,293 --> 01:36:38,363
Aanchal“.

1599
01:36:39,896 --> 01:36:40,897
Yeah?

1600
01:36:41,898 --> 01:36:43,343
You know?

1601
01:36:46,436 --> 01:36:47,676
Yeah?

1602
01:36:59,683 --> 01:37:00,991
When are you back?

1603
01:37:02,952 --> 01:37:04,090
I don't know.

1604
01:37:04,788 --> 01:37:05,994
I have no plans.

1605
01:37:07,290 --> 01:37:11,102
Do you have any plans of coming
to India? - Not right now.

1606
01:37:11,795 --> 01:37:14,298
But I will, one day.

1607
01:37:16,266 --> 01:37:17,244
Okay.

1608
01:37:18,034 --> 01:37:21,106
Thanks, for everything.

1609
01:37:24,040 --> 01:37:25,178
I had fun.

1610
01:37:34,284 --> 01:37:38,027
So I'll see you tomorrow
before I leave, right?

1611
01:37:39,089 --> 01:37:41,194
I have to meet Armaan“.

1612
01:37:41,725 --> 01:37:42,294
Deadlines“

1613
01:37:42,358 --> 01:37:45,134
You know how it is.
- I know. No problem.

1614
01:37:45,195 --> 01:37:47,334
I'll try.
- It's okay.

1615
01:37:50,400 --> 01:37:52,812
So bye, I guess?

1616
01:38:08,752 --> 01:38:09,753
Bye.

1617
01:38:41,384 --> 01:38:44,695
That turned out such an anti-climax.
- It's correct.

1618
01:38:44,754 --> 01:38:47,166
We decided not to
complicate the situation.

1619
01:38:47,791 --> 01:38:51,364
But you want her to come back.

1620
01:39:05,675 --> 01:39:07,154
Why haven't you answered your phone?

1621
01:39:07,210 --> 01:39:08,917
Sorry, must be somewhere inside.

1622
01:39:08,978 --> 01:39:10,355
What are you doing here?

1623
01:39:10,413 --> 01:39:12,893
Where's your husband?
- I left him!

1624
01:39:12,949 --> 01:39:14,986
What? For me?
- Shut up!

1625
01:39:15,418 --> 01:39:19,833
I'm not leaving until he comes here
and apologizes lo me.

1626
01:39:19,889 --> 01:39:22,301
That could take weeks!
- So is that a problem?

1627
01:39:22,358 --> 01:39:24,201
That's fine. That's fine.

1628
01:39:26,162 --> 01:39:29,405
I'll take your bed,
you take the couch, okay?

1629
01:39:30,366 --> 01:39:33,779
Actually, I have a backache. That
bed is specifically designed for me.

1630
01:39:33,837 --> 01:39:37,375
Yudi, I've only heard this crap
a few million limes.

1631
01:39:38,074 --> 01:39:41,681
Besides, you could sleep on the
floor, it's really good for the back.

1632
01:39:43,746 --> 01:39:47,990
So basically, the first time
I feel something for a girl..

1633
01:39:48,351 --> 01:39:50,957
“And she's leaving.
- Oh my God!

1634
01:39:51,788 --> 01:39:54,792
You're in love with her.
- I don't know if it's love.

1635
01:39:55,058 --> 01:39:56,799
That's your problem.

1636
01:39:56,860 --> 01:39:59,306
You never accept your feelings.

1637
01:39:59,362 --> 01:40:00,306
If you go on like this“

1638
01:40:00,363 --> 01:40:02,639
...you'll slay alone all your life.

1639
01:40:03,299 --> 01:40:05,370
Anyway, can I ask you something?

1640
01:40:06,769 --> 01:40:09,010
Can you live without her?
- Of course.

1641
01:40:09,272 --> 01:40:10,910
I can live without anyone.

1642
01:40:10,974 --> 01:40:12,351
I don't need anybody.

1643
01:40:14,711 --> 01:40:15,917
Let me put it in a different way.

1644
01:40:16,379 --> 01:40:19,622
Will you miss her if she leaves?

1645
01:40:23,686 --> 01:40:25,222
Maybe.
- That's it. It's love.

1646
01:40:25,288 --> 01:40:26,358
This is love?

1647
01:40:26,723 --> 01:40:28,760
Well, not for the rest of the world.

1648
01:40:29,025 --> 01:40:32,268
But for your standards,
this is enough.

1649
01:40:33,763 --> 01:40:36,972
Since it's established you're
in love-ish with her.. - But we..

1650
01:40:37,033 --> 01:40:40,207
Shh! I think now that it's clear.

1651
01:40:40,870 --> 01:40:42,611
You should go tell her.

1652
01:40:43,139 --> 01:40:44,311
Seriously, Yudi.

1653
01:40:44,941 --> 01:40:49,754
Slop living your life like a comedy.
Live it like a love story.

1654
01:40:50,680 --> 01:40:53,126
Kick ass line.
I should write that down.

1655
01:40:54,050 --> 01:40:55,791
My kick and you're fool!

1656
01:40:56,085 --> 01:40:57,621
You're in love!

1657
01:40:57,887 --> 01:40:59,889
Mommy.
- Oh, honey.

1658
01:41:07,697 --> 01:41:09,370
Come here.
Come here, honey.

1659
01:41:09,732 --> 01:41:10,938
You okay?

1660
01:41:26,449 --> 01:41:27,826
Look who's here?

1661
01:41:27,884 --> 01:41:29,864
Daddy's here!

1662
01:41:31,020 --> 01:41:32,966
Okay, come on,
let's give you your bag.

1663
01:41:33,022 --> 01:41:34,262
Come on, honey.

1664
01:41:34,324 --> 01:41:36,099
Come on!
- Daddy!

1665
01:41:36,159 --> 01:41:37,399
Daddy!

1666
01:41:38,328 --> 01:41:40,968
Take care, okay?

1667
01:41:42,732 --> 01:41:44,143
Listen, Divya.

1668
01:41:46,102 --> 01:41:48,048
I know I hurt you bad.

1669
01:41:49,172 --> 01:41:50,776
I never said this properly.

1670
01:41:53,176 --> 01:41:54,314
But I'm really sorry.

1671
01:41:57,080 --> 01:41:58,923
Can you say that again, please?

1672
01:42:00,383 --> 01:42:01,953
I really am sorry.

1673
01:42:02,885 --> 01:42:05,195
Its okay, I wasn't any less, either.

1674
01:42:05,254 --> 01:42:06,130
You know?

1675
01:42:06,189 --> 01:42:09,796
Anyway, come here.
- I'll get crushed.

1676
01:42:10,727 --> 01:42:12,604
Come on. Give me a hug.

1677
01:42:19,402 --> 01:42:21,814
You take care of yourself, okay?
- You too.

1678
01:42:34,717 --> 01:42:35,923
She's leaving.

1679
01:42:37,720 --> 01:42:39,825
Aanchal.
- I know.

1680
01:42:40,990 --> 01:42:44,164
You think I should“
- Yes, I think you should.

1681
01:42:44,227 --> 01:42:46,764
The Airport Climax never fails.

1682
01:42:47,363 --> 01:42:49,934
What rubbish!
- That's how the world works.

1683
01:42:49,999 --> 01:42:51,808
Don't try to change the rules.

1684
01:42:51,868 --> 01:42:53,711
Look, no one knows why..

1685
01:42:53,770 --> 01:42:55,943
“But, the Airport
Climax Scene always works.

1686
01:42:56,005 --> 01:42:57,916
But they won't let me inside.

1687
01:42:57,974 --> 01:43:00,181
Buy a cheap ticket to somewhere.

1688
01:43:01,677 --> 01:43:05,352
I could always call and stop her.
- That'll just kill the effect.

1689
01:43:17,293 --> 01:43:18,772
Nonsense!

1690
01:43:35,745 --> 01:43:38,385
Sir.
- Be back in a minute, buddy.

1691
01:44:14,417 --> 01:44:15,725
Look at that guy.

1692
01:44:15,785 --> 01:44:17,321
Driving like an maniac.

1693
01:44:19,021 --> 01:44:21,865
And people blame us taxi drivers.

1694
01:44:21,924 --> 01:44:23,699
As if the road is
his father's property.

1695
01:44:27,263 --> 01:44:28,742
Hey!

1696
01:44:30,099 --> 01:44:33,410
Stop the cab!
- Stupid Indian!

1697
01:44:33,469 --> 01:44:34,880
Stop the cab!

1698
01:44:34,937 --> 01:44:37,281
I'll show you who's
the real Michael Schumacher!

1699
01:44:43,846 --> 01:44:44,950
Aanchal!

1700
01:44:45,414 --> 01:44:46,688
Aanchal!

1701
01:44:49,152 --> 01:44:51,257
You?
- Tell him to stop.

1702
01:44:51,320 --> 01:44:54,665
What are you doing here?!
- Tell that moron to stop!

1703
01:44:55,725 --> 01:44:58,171
Careful, you might hurt someone.
- No, madam.

1704
01:44:58,227 --> 01:44:59,365
We will win this race.

1705
01:44:59,428 --> 01:45:02,102
What is he doing?
- I know him. Stop!

1706
01:45:02,165 --> 01:45:04,111
Stop!
- You know this fool?

1707
01:45:04,167 --> 01:45:05,737
Yes! Please stop the car.

1708
01:45:05,801 --> 01:45:08,645
You could've said this before.

1709
01:45:21,751 --> 01:45:24,061
What are you doing here?

1710
01:45:24,453 --> 01:45:25,898
I've got something to tell you.

1711
01:45:26,856 --> 01:45:27,834
Please don't.

1712
01:45:29,292 --> 01:45:32,296
You don't even know what I'm going
to say. - I don't want to know.

1713
01:45:33,196 --> 01:45:34,436
You won't even give me a chance?

1714
01:45:34,497 --> 01:45:36,067
Don't ruin it, Yudi.

1715
01:45:42,305 --> 01:45:47,015
Really?
- It's easier said than done.

1716
01:45:48,010 --> 01:45:50,957
And we don't believe
in all this, right.

1717
01:45:51,914 --> 01:45:53,825
No falling in love, remember?

1718
01:45:54,884 --> 01:45:56,625
But I can change.

1719
01:45:57,286 --> 01:45:58,264
Maybe“

1720
01:45:59,455 --> 01:46:01,833
I'm not just talking about you.

1721
01:46:05,261 --> 01:46:06,797
I am not ready for this, Yudi.

1722
01:46:07,263 --> 01:46:10,142
And I know you aren't either.

1723
01:46:12,368 --> 01:46:13,904
Trust me on this.

1724
01:46:14,170 --> 01:46:16,116
You'll thank me for this later.

1725
01:46:22,278 --> 01:46:24,087
We'll still be friends.

1726
01:46:41,998 --> 01:46:44,672
"Boasts all the time."

1727
01:46:46,068 --> 01:46:48,844
"But turns out to be a dud."

1728
01:46:50,206 --> 01:46:52,982
"Bad luck sent a gift."

1729
01:46:54,243 --> 01:46:57,122
"But he was really happy to see it."

1730
01:46:58,314 --> 01:47:02,194
"Even after hearing
his doom calling.."

1731
01:47:02,451 --> 01:47:07,730
"...stupid fool asks what is that?"

1732
01:47:08,391 --> 01:47:12,635
"Bro...you're such a pussycat."

1733
01:47:12,895 --> 01:47:16,399
"A big oaf and spoil brat."

1734
01:47:16,699 --> 01:47:21,148
"You've no reason to chat."

1735
01:47:21,203 --> 01:47:24,980
"Bro...you're such a pussy...cat."

1736
01:47:43,159 --> 01:47:44,695
What are you doing, Yudi?

1737
01:47:45,194 --> 01:47:46,730
What's wrong with you?

1738
01:47:47,363 --> 01:47:48,933
That's enough.

1739
01:47:59,742 --> 01:48:01,153
Thank you for getting me here, Yudi.

1740
01:48:01,210 --> 01:48:03,121
I'm so happy you're
back in your senses.

1741
01:48:03,179 --> 01:48:06,183
Your depression made my life boring.

1742
01:48:06,248 --> 01:48:09,195
But yeah, how long will
I cry over one girl?

1743
01:48:14,156 --> 01:48:16,193
Did I give her a dollar less?

1744
01:48:18,194 --> 01:48:20,037
Let's do something wild.

1745
01:48:28,237 --> 01:48:29,375
Don't answer!

1746
01:48:51,193 --> 01:48:52,604
Oh!

1747
01:48:55,164 --> 01:48:56,871
Oh, so what's wrong with him?
- Unfortunately“

1748
01:48:56,932 --> 01:48:59,071
“he's had an anxiety attack.
- Oh my God!

1749
01:49:04,340 --> 01:49:05,978
Hey, Yudi.
- Hi.

1750
01:49:06,041 --> 01:49:07,179
What happened?

1751
01:49:09,345 --> 01:49:10,619
I'm pregnant.

1752
01:49:11,280 --> 01:49:12,884
Shoot!

1753
01:49:13,182 --> 01:49:15,219
I'm so sorry.

1754
01:49:15,284 --> 01:49:17,264
He's dying, isn't he?
He's dying, right?

1755
01:49:17,319 --> 01:49:18,798
If anything happens to him,
I'll be all alone.

1756
01:49:18,854 --> 01:49:20,891
No, Montu, he isn't dying.

1757
01:49:20,956 --> 01:49:22,993
Then what happened?

1758
01:49:24,827 --> 01:49:26,363
I'm pregnant with your child.

1759
01:49:27,296 --> 01:49:30,300
Oops“ baby? How?

1760
01:49:30,366 --> 01:49:31,811
What do you mean by how?

1761
01:49:31,867 --> 01:49:34,370
What's going on? Why are all the women
getting pregnant at the same time?

1762
01:49:34,703 --> 01:49:35,704
Is this some kind of flu?

1763
01:49:35,771 --> 01:49:37,341
Shut up, Montu. Please.

1764
01:49:39,175 --> 01:49:40,677
Now we're really brothers.

1765
01:49:41,010 --> 01:49:43,923
My wife and your
Vishakha, are both pregnant.

1766
01:49:44,647 --> 01:49:45,785
Didn't I always tell you, Yudi?

1767
01:49:45,848 --> 01:49:47,327
No matter how many
girls you fool around with..

1768
01:49:47,650 --> 01:49:49,789
...you'll end up marrying her.

1769
01:49:50,686 --> 01:49:52,632
Relax, relax, I'm just joking.

1770
01:49:52,688 --> 01:49:54,133
Relax.

1771
01:49:56,292 --> 01:49:58,772
I love you, Yudi.
You're my best friend.

1772
01:49:59,028 --> 01:50:01,304
Please don't die!
- Don't worry.

1773
01:50:04,166 --> 01:50:06,703
You aren't wearing anything below?
- No.

1774
01:50:15,177 --> 01:50:17,020
So what are you going to do?

1775
01:50:17,079 --> 01:50:21,221
Vishakha's pregnant,
I can't abandon her now.

1776
01:50:23,819 --> 01:50:25,628
I have to do the right thing.

1777
01:50:27,857 --> 01:50:30,167
Let's try to get a hold of your life.

1778
01:50:30,226 --> 01:50:32,797
You're going to marry
the girl you don't love..

1779
01:50:32,862 --> 01:50:34,773
“Because
she's pregnant with your child.

1780
01:50:35,264 --> 01:50:38,404
The girl you loved is
now the mother of three kids“

1781
01:50:38,467 --> 01:50:41,641
“and stays at your place
with her kids whenever she wants.

1782
01:50:42,004 --> 01:50:44,917
And the girl you love now..

1783
01:50:44,974 --> 01:50:48,854
Is treating you the exact same way you
treated all your girlfriends so far.

1784
01:50:50,145 --> 01:50:51,920
Karma is being bitchy.

1785
01:50:53,315 --> 01:50:55,192
So what's your point?

1786
01:50:55,885 --> 01:50:59,059
There's no point.
You're just screwed, that's all.

1787
01:51:00,823 --> 01:51:02,166
Idiot!

1788
01:51:04,393 --> 01:51:11,140
"They say love dwells in every heart."

1789
01:51:11,400 --> 01:51:17,180
"Someone just needs to find it."

1790
01:51:18,774 --> 01:51:25,020
"You never know when
one falls in love."

1791
01:51:25,915 --> 01:51:31,661
"When the eyes...meet."

1792
01:51:31,720 --> 01:51:35,167
"The distance made me realize.."

1793
01:51:35,224 --> 01:51:38,865
"..how close you're to me."

1794
01:52:05,054 --> 01:52:07,261
Surprise!

1795
01:52:08,891 --> 01:52:11,872
Happy birthday! Yudi cutiepie!

1796
01:52:13,228 --> 01:52:15,037
I got him good!

1797
01:52:16,332 --> 01:52:18,073
Everybody's here.

1798
01:52:20,035 --> 01:52:21,105
Thanks.

1799
01:52:24,239 --> 01:52:27,379
"Happy birthday to you!"

1800
01:52:37,920 --> 01:52:39,263
She's nice.

1801
01:52:41,890 --> 01:52:42,994
Okay.

1802
01:52:44,259 --> 01:52:45,101
HI.

1803
01:52:46,061 --> 01:52:47,039
Montu.

1804
01:52:47,329 --> 01:52:51,277
I'm sure Yudi's told you about me.
- Not really.

1805
01:52:52,101 --> 01:52:52,977
Oh!

1806
01:52:56,038 --> 01:52:58,609
Yudi and I have been
BFFs for 15 years.

1807
01:52:59,074 --> 01:53:01,281
Best Friends Forever.

1808
01:53:01,844 --> 01:53:03,050
Oh!

1809
01:53:03,779 --> 01:53:05,622
I was Yudi's GF.

1810
01:53:06,115 --> 01:53:09,324
I'm F now, and will soon be W.

1811
01:53:10,786 --> 01:53:12,288
We're very close.

1812
01:53:12,821 --> 01:53:15,859
I mean close friends.

1813
01:53:16,725 --> 01:53:18,864
I am pregnant with his child.

1814
01:53:34,843 --> 01:53:36,322
Hey-
- HeY-

1815
01:53:44,386 --> 01:53:46,332
Yudi pudie pie.

1816
01:53:46,889 --> 01:53:48,391
I love you.

1817
01:53:55,264 --> 01:53:59,804
You've never once
said "I love you" to me.

1818
01:54:03,238 --> 01:54:06,742
You know what?
I don't want to marry you.

1819
01:54:07,943 --> 01:54:09,786
Come on, Vishakha.
- No.

1820
01:54:09,845 --> 01:54:13,850
If you're marrying me out of pity,
I don't want any of it.

1821
01:54:13,916 --> 01:54:17,159
It's not pity, this is our kid.
- Yudi..

1822
01:54:17,786 --> 01:54:19,060
I'm not pregnant.

1823
01:54:20,489 --> 01:54:21,797
I'm sorry? What?!

1824
01:54:22,257 --> 01:54:23,998
I lied to you.

1825
01:54:24,059 --> 01:54:26,039
What?I
- I know.

1826
01:54:30,165 --> 01:54:31,906
I'm having a panic attack again.

1827
01:54:31,967 --> 01:54:36,347
But why? Why? - Because“
I thought it was the only way.

1828
01:54:36,405 --> 01:54:38,146
You'd have never said yes otherwise.

1829
01:54:38,207 --> 01:54:41,677
But such a big lie?
Have you lost your mind?

1830
01:54:41,977 --> 01:54:44,617
Vishakha, that's just mean.

1831
01:54:46,048 --> 01:54:47,686
You're crazy!

1832
01:54:47,750 --> 01:54:51,630
You have a right to be angry.
Say what you need to say.

1833
01:54:51,954 --> 01:54:55,800
I could've got a heart attack.
I could've died!

1834
01:54:56,325 --> 01:54:59,795
Don't worry. You won't die so easily.

1835
01:55:00,162 --> 01:55:03,200
You love yourself too much.

1836
01:55:22,151 --> 01:55:24,791
I'll just mail it to you.
- Don't worry about it.

1837
01:56:06,895 --> 01:56:10,172
You should go to her.
- And do what?

1838
01:56:10,232 --> 01:56:14,203
Tell her that you love her.

1839
01:56:14,703 --> 01:56:16,080
I've said it once already.

1840
01:56:16,138 --> 01:56:17,845
You want me say it again?

1841
01:56:18,373 --> 01:56:19,977
You'll have to say it from the heart.

1842
01:56:20,342 --> 01:56:23,255
And prove you really love her.

1843
01:56:24,112 --> 01:56:25,420
Prove to whom?

1844
01:56:25,781 --> 01:56:27,089
Them.

1845
01:56:28,016 --> 01:56:30,690
Who?
- Them. Them.

1846
01:56:31,486 --> 01:56:32,430
What?

1847
01:56:32,487 --> 01:56:36,435
Prove to the whole world,
the universe“

1848
01:56:36,792 --> 01:56:40,262
...that you've changed,
and that you love this girl.

1849
01:56:40,729 --> 01:56:46,179
But before that, you have
to really change from the inside.

1850
01:56:47,769 --> 01:56:49,373
How much more do I have to change?

1851
01:56:50,873 --> 01:56:52,819
Change can't be measured.

1852
01:56:52,875 --> 01:56:55,651
It can only be felt.

1853
01:57:02,451 --> 01:57:04,397
In movies, this is so easy“

1854
01:57:04,453 --> 01:57:06,194
Music does half the work..

1855
01:57:06,255 --> 01:57:08,394
“And everything's fine
in a minute or two.

1856
01:57:08,457 --> 01:57:11,301
But there's no option
for poetry in life.

1857
01:57:17,933 --> 01:57:20,777
The last few years,
I started many books..

1858
01:57:20,836 --> 01:57:22,338
...never finished even one.

1859
01:57:22,771 --> 01:57:25,308
I was afraid that
Ending should not be bad.

1860
01:57:25,774 --> 01:57:27,754
See. I don't like endings.

1861
01:57:28,043 --> 01:57:31,081
If I don't write ending
then at least hope remains.

1862
01:57:35,083 --> 01:57:40,260
This time, I'll have to
commit to one story honestly.

1863
01:57:40,789 --> 01:57:42,325
So what if I fail?

1864
01:57:42,691 --> 01:57:44,728
At least I won't be scared anymore.

1865
01:57:45,861 --> 01:57:49,206
Oh no. No. No.

1866
01:58:06,315 --> 01:58:08,022
You actually wrote the script.

1867
01:58:08,417 --> 01:58:10,727
I thought I'd have to
return their advance.

1868
01:58:10,786 --> 01:58:12,163
I even got my cheque book.

1869
01:58:12,821 --> 01:58:15,358
Remember, don't stare.

1870
01:58:15,424 --> 01:58:16,334
Come.

1871
01:58:23,131 --> 01:58:25,042
I said, don't stare.

1872
01:58:34,109 --> 01:58:35,110
Hello.

1873
01:58:38,080 --> 01:58:39,218
What's this?

1874
01:58:39,281 --> 01:58:40,419
The script.

1875
01:58:53,362 --> 01:58:55,137
Come narrate it to me.

1876
01:58:55,197 --> 01:58:56,835
On the beach.

1877
01:58:56,898 --> 01:59:01,313
He is convinced he's
unable to finish the book..

1878
01:59:02,771 --> 01:59:06,275
“Because he can never start it.
Suddenly“

1879
01:59:09,011 --> 01:59:14,859
Suddenly, he realizes that
silence is the best poem.

1880
01:59:14,916 --> 01:59:18,693
And“ he wrote it down“

1881
01:59:22,324 --> 01:59:24,270
Cut to wide!

1882
01:59:25,127 --> 01:59:28,040
A red convertible
enters in slow motion.

1883
01:59:28,096 --> 01:59:29,040
And them.

1884
01:59:29,097 --> 01:59:32,044
Jimmy, jimmy, jimmy, jimmy,
jimmy, jimmy, jimmy, jimmy, close!

1885
01:59:33,168 --> 01:59:35,375
He wears his sunglasses,
lights up his cigarette,

1886
01:59:35,437 --> 01:59:37,348
A superhit song starts,

1887
01:59:37,973 --> 01:59:39,247
That's the hero's reentry.

1888
01:59:40,475 --> 01:59:43,285
In high speed, another red
convertible screeches to a halt.

1889
01:59:43,345 --> 01:59:45,951
There's this stunning
beauty sitting inside.

1890
01:59:46,014 --> 01:59:47,186
Cut to your close. Cut to her close.

1891
01:59:47,249 --> 01:59:48,626
Cut to your close. Cut to her close.

1892
01:59:48,683 --> 01:59:51,129
He's playing a song for
her on the guitar. Soft music!

1893
01:59:51,386 --> 01:59:53,889
And it strikes a chord
in the girl's heart.

1894
01:59:54,189 --> 01:59:56,601
She turns around,
and it starts to rain.

1895
01:59:56,958 --> 02:00:00,064
He's wandering around like a madman,
missing her.

1896
02:00:00,128 --> 02:00:01,334
Rain continues.

1897
02:00:01,663 --> 02:00:03,233
He looks towards the sea and smiles.

1898
02:00:03,298 --> 02:00:05,608
Methinks, one day“

1899
02:00:06,068 --> 02:00:07,240
One day.

1900
02:00:07,936 --> 02:00:09,108
Then?

1901
02:00:09,171 --> 02:00:10,673
What then?

1902
02:00:11,807 --> 02:00:13,844
That's all I wrote.
- What?

1903
02:00:13,909 --> 02:00:15,286
Where's the ending?

1904
02:00:18,113 --> 02:00:20,059
I haven't found the ending.

1905
02:00:20,715 --> 02:00:22,126
I'm going in search of it.

1906
02:00:23,718 --> 02:00:30,829
"I found it...
- But I didn't know it."

1907
02:00:30,892 --> 02:00:37,070
"Since I knew you..
- I forgot everything else."

1908
02:00:38,200 --> 02:00:44,048
"I found it...
- But I didn't know it."

1909
02:00:44,773 --> 02:00:52,089
"Since I knew you..
- I forgot everything else."

1910
02:01:04,860 --> 02:01:06,999
What do you want?
- Aanchal.

1911
02:01:07,062 --> 02:01:10,134
Ma'am. Someone hereto see you.

1912
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,002
So, what are you doing here?

1913
02:01:14,402 --> 02:01:17,975
Well, I was in the neighborhood.
So I thought I'd just say hi.

1914
02:01:18,039 --> 02:01:19,040
Okay.

1915
02:01:19,107 --> 02:01:20,177
Hello.

1916
02:01:20,242 --> 02:01:21,186
HI.

1917
02:01:21,710 --> 02:01:24,657
Are you done with your script?
- Well, almost.

1918
02:01:24,913 --> 02:01:26,221
I couldn't find the ending.

1919
02:01:26,281 --> 02:01:28,852
That's why I'm here.
- Oh.

1920
02:01:29,317 --> 02:01:30,921
I thought you came hereto see me.

1921
02:01:31,786 --> 02:01:34,767
I have a few notes.
- Of the climax?

1922
02:01:37,726 --> 02:01:39,000
For you.

1923
02:01:39,761 --> 02:01:40,831
Me?

1924
02:01:41,163 --> 02:01:43,871
You said don't ruin
things by saying it.

1925
02:01:44,199 --> 02:01:45,769
So I wrote it down.

1926
02:01:46,835 --> 02:01:49,782
I'm a writer, after all.
I need to read what I've written,

1927
02:01:49,838 --> 02:01:51,283
...to really understand.

1928
02:01:52,073 --> 02:01:53,279
Read it.

1929
02:01:55,810 --> 02:01:59,781
"If you want to learn how to swim,
you have to jump into the water."

1930
02:02:00,048 --> 02:02:02,187
"How long will I
to sit in my boat scared of.."

1931
02:02:02,250 --> 02:02:04,025
Okay, that's rubbish.

1932
02:02:04,085 --> 02:02:05,758
It was just warm-up.

1933
02:02:05,820 --> 02:02:07,663
It's nonsense.
Read the next one.

1934
02:02:10,358 --> 02:02:13,828
They say opposites attract.
It's a lie.

1935
02:02:14,696 --> 02:02:17,142
Everywhere, we look
for a reflection of us.

1936
02:02:17,432 --> 02:02:21,312
If you ever do find one,
treasure it, keep it safe.

1937
02:02:26,975 --> 02:02:28,318
Oh nonsense!

1938
02:02:28,977 --> 02:02:32,049
The best line just flew away.
- Sorry.

1939
02:02:32,681 --> 02:02:33,921
You know, Aanchal.

1940
02:02:34,349 --> 02:02:37,193
I'm not asking you to spend
the rest of your life with me.

1941
02:02:37,252 --> 02:02:39,289
Who wants a lifelong commitment?

1942
02:02:39,354 --> 02:02:41,334
Let's take a day at a time.

1943
02:02:41,389 --> 02:02:44,233
We won't think about the
future or look at the past.

1944
02:02:45,026 --> 02:02:46,733
We'll just take care of the present.

1945
02:02:48,964 --> 02:02:52,810
And before you know it, we'd
have spent the rest of our lives“

1946
02:03:03,278 --> 02:03:04,188
Aanchal“.

1947
02:03:08,750 --> 02:03:09,922
I love“

1948
02:03:12,754 --> 02:03:13,926
You okay?

1949
02:03:14,289 --> 02:03:15,290
Yeah.

1950
02:03:15,724 --> 02:03:16,668
Good.

1951
02:03:16,725 --> 02:03:20,901
So, I said I love you.

1952
02:03:21,429 --> 02:03:22,931
Do you have something to say?

1953
02:03:25,333 --> 02:03:26,641
Thanks.

1954
02:03:28,436 --> 02:03:31,212
Thanks? Are you serious?

1955
02:03:31,273 --> 02:03:35,312
What? - I mean, it was hard
for me to say that l..

1956
02:03:40,015 --> 02:03:45,795
"They say love dwells
in every heart."

1957
02:03:47,155 --> 02:03:51,797
"Someone just needs to find it."

1958
02:03:54,262 --> 02:03:57,675
By the way you didn't
answer my question.

1959
02:03:57,999 --> 02:04:00,377
You said lets take a day at a time.

1960
02:04:00,435 --> 02:04:02,938
So only today.
We can think about tomorrow later.

1961
02:04:03,004 --> 02:04:04,347
Oh really?

1962
02:04:05,740 --> 02:04:08,016
Every story can have a happy ending.

1963
02:04:08,076 --> 02:04:10,147
If you end it at the right time.

1964
02:04:10,945 --> 02:04:14,256
For now, this is The End to my story.

1965
02:04:15,750 --> 02:04:19,857
"I found it...

1966
02:04:20,221 --> 02:04:22,132
I came all the way
from America just for you.

1967
02:04:22,724 --> 02:04:25,261
Even forever seemed like
an hour waiting for you.

1968
02:04:25,794 --> 02:04:28,866
Now, no one can separate us.

1969
02:04:29,464 --> 02:04:31,273
I love you, baby doll.

1970
02:04:33,101 --> 02:04:34,341
Aaand CUT!

1971
02:04:34,936 --> 02:04:36,973
Mind-blowing, Armaanji. Superb!

1972
02:04:37,439 --> 02:04:39,783
Did you understand what I said?
- Not really.

1973
02:04:39,841 --> 02:04:41,411
Come to the van, I'll explain it to you.

1974
02:04:41,476 --> 02:04:42,648
Thanks.

1975
02:04:44,679 --> 02:04:48,058
They should have casted Aliya.
By paying ten million rupees or so more.

1976
02:04:48,116 --> 02:04:49,254
She's a bit old.

1977
02:04:49,317 --> 02:04:52,230
Excuse me,
Sir, I didn't write that dialogue.

1978
02:04:52,287 --> 02:04:53,322
What is he saying?

1979
02:04:53,688 --> 02:04:55,190
First time, right?
- But“.

1980
02:04:55,256 --> 02:04:56,792
It's okay.

1981
02:04:57,692 --> 02:04:59,865
Superb, Sir. Superb.
- Thanks.

1982
02:05:00,261 --> 02:05:01,763
How was it?

1983
02:05:02,731 --> 02:05:03,869
Nice.

1984
02:05:07,235 --> 02:05:08,771
How are the dialogues coming?

1985
02:05:11,005 --> 02:05:11,847
Kick ass!

1986
02:05:11,906 --> 02:05:14,250
"Boasts all the time."

1987
02:05:16,010 --> 02:05:18,388
"But turns out to be a dud."

1988
02:05:20,081 --> 02:05:22,687
"Bad luck sent a gift."

1989
02:05:24,185 --> 02:05:26,859
"But he was really happy to see it."

1990
02:05:28,123 --> 02:05:32,333
"Even after hearing
his doom calling.."

1991
02:05:32,394 --> 02:05:37,104
"...stupid fool asks what is that?"

1992
02:05:38,233 --> 02:05:42,147
"Bro...you're such a pussycat."

1993
02:05:42,203 --> 02:05:46,276
"A big oaf and spoil brat."

1994
02:05:46,341 --> 02:05:49,686
"You've no reason to chat."

1995
02:05:50,912 --> 02:05:54,689
"Bro...you're such a pussy...cat."

1996
02:06:07,195 --> 02:06:13,737
"I wonder what your destiny...
has in store for you."

1997
02:06:15,703 --> 02:06:22,143
"Son...you're stuck...in your own trap."

1998
02:06:23,878 --> 02:06:27,348
"A little girl...bowled you over."

1999
02:06:27,949 --> 02:06:32,830
"And you just held to your bat."

2000
02:06:33,788 --> 02:06:37,793
"Bro...you're such a pussycat."

2001
02:06:37,859 --> 02:06:41,807
"A big oaf and spoil brat."

2002
02:06:41,863 --> 02:06:45,208
"You've no reason to chat."

2003
02:06:46,301 --> 02:06:50,443
"Bro...you're such a pussy...cat."
