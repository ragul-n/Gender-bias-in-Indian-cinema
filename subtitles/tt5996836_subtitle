1
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:36,882
l'm still helping you out.

2
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:39,479
Atired opponent,

3
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:42,682
can kill all the
fun of the game.

4
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,258
Sam, do you know?

5
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:57,766
How good this feels?

6
00:03:58,805 --> 00:03:59,965
You've seen flowers, right?

7
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:01,697
Beautiful flowers?

8
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:04,811
The thrill is when you pluck
them out & make them yours,

9
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:07,041
not when you wait for
them to wither away!

10
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:08,280
Hey!

11
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:10,239
Bloody b@#@$@d!

12
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:19,320
l like this spirit of yours!

13
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:41,841
He is travelling.

14
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,678
The signals are moving
from the city to the east.

15
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:24,156
Bose!

16
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:25,649
Chandrabose!

17
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:28,990
Get out of my way!

18
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,986
Bose,
Chandrabose,

19
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,893
That wimpy Vishwan,

20
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:35,894
is going to propose to
that 'Bragger' Sara.

21
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:55,347
Attracting girls, is an art.

22
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:56,513
Can you do that?

23
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:58,079
l can & l will
make her fall for me.

24
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,214
Are you prepared?

25
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:00,592
What?

26
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,061
What's your plan?

27
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:03,050
Just wait & watch!

28
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:04,230
He will mess it up!

29
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,398
She is very gutsy!

30
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:07,525
lf something happens, these
guys will be there for you.

31
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:09,659
Bus No.3 is here!

32
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:14,206
Dude, go!

33
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:16,375
Those scoundrels are watching us!

34
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:17,364
Don't embarrass us!

35
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,373
Are you happy now that you've
gotten him into trouble?

36
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:37,726
'Oh dear Sara!'

37
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:38,764
You & your Sara!

38
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:52,635
Sara, the flirt is coming.

39
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:55,714
Sara!

40
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,073
He will mess up!
l'm sure!

41
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:02,186
This is a rare coin! You have
a coin collection, right?

42
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:07,259
Ashwin,

43
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:08,794
Notjust a coin collection,

44
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:10,261
l have a stamp
collection as well.

45
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:12,522
But if you're planning to
woo me with all this,

46
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,089
you'll be taught a lesson!

47
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:16,468
Sheesh!

48
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,628
- This is his usual trick.

49
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:20,262
All the fools are here!

50
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:22,774
Hey Jimbru,

51
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,236
you look handsome!

52
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,478
Did you have a bath today?
- You fatso!

53
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:29,315
- Dude, stop! Don't hit her!
- Get lost!

54
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:30,516
Awesome, Meenu!

55
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:31,744
- l will kill hertoday!

56
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,316
- Listen to me!
Calm down!

57
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:21,864
Phew!
We're lucky!

58
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,207
Aren't you narrating the story?

59
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,104
lt's not a story!

60
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:33,167
They are real incidents!

61
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:34,872
l know that!
Say it!

62
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:42,288
Back then, Mumbai was
known as Bombay.

63
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:43,653
Say it like your daddy!

64
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:49,585
Where the pouring rains,

65
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,230
and the caressing breeze

66
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:53,528
had the scent of blood - Bombay!

67
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,863
Back then, Mumbai was
known as Bombay!

68
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:04,202
An age where the stories of the
bleeding streets were narrated by guns!

69
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:10,707
When the underworld was ruled by Kareem
Lala, Chota Shakeel & Dawood lbrahim.

70
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:14,913
There, my Papa!

71
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:17,389
David Ninan.

72
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:18,890
My dad!

73
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:22,227
Papa's Company wanted to start
an apartment project in Andheri.

74
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:28,764
The goons of those
underworld dons,

75
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:29,835
Except them!

76
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:33,761
Even after the Police & Collector
initiated a clear-off, they didn't agree.

77
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:40,245
And then?

78
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:48,784
His John Lobb shoes are shown!

79
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:54,254
He wears his sunglasses!

80
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,888
Papa took out his gun and held
their leader at point blank.

81
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:06,262
And thus, he made them vacate
Andheri, within an hour!

82
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:09,774
Ya right! Even Mohanlal took one whole
night to make them vacate Dharavi.

83
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:11,400
That was Mohanlal!
This is my Papa!

84
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:12,933
So much bragging!

85
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:15,542
She would even say that Burj
Khalifa was made by her Papa.

86
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:16,740
Don't believe anything!

87
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:19,511
Like Spiderman or Superman..
All are fake stories!

88
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:20,779
Ya! That's true!

89
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,518
- She & her Papa!

90
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:26,819
-And so many bogus stories!

91
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:40,438
So funny!

92
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:47,843
'Bragger Sara'

93
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,676
- Bragger Sara!

94
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:03,791
Sara, can you give me
a couple of bombs?

95
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:14,967
Oh my God!

96
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:16,525
Oh my God!
A gun?

97
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:22,635
Hey!
Run!

98
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:23,970
Bragger Sara brought a gun!

99
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,067
Get out of my way!

100
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:47,722
What did you think?

101
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,695
That this is California,
Pennsylvania or Texas?

102
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:53,830
A child holding a gun?

103
00:17:57,476 --> 00:17:58,807
l have to report this!

104
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,879
lf any of the kids
had been shot..

105
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,148
What's the point in reporting to
the police afterthey're killed?

106
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,640
What do you say, Chairman Joby?

107
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:09,078
What Maithreyan Sir said is right.

108
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:11,452
Notjust a gun. There
were six bullets as well!

109
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,651
l don't know how
Sara got hold of it.

110
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:17,492
That's her grandpa's.

111
00:18:17,729 --> 00:18:18,787
He is an ex-military man.

112
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:20,126
And he has a license.
- So?

113
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:21,861
Grandpa has the license;

114
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:23,058
not Sara, right?

115
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:25,560
Was her dad a goon in
Mumbai in the past?

116
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:28,973
Sara is narrating violent
stories to other kids.

117
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:31,608
So, let her daddy come here.

118
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:35,070
He is responsible forthis,

119
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:37,142
And he has to come!

120
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:40,646
Let that underworld
don come here!

121
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:47,719
David is out of town.

122
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,760
No! l will have to take an action!

123
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:55,660
David had spoken to me about donating a
good amount forthe school's new block.

124
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:57,429
Oh! Did David say so?

125
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:01,464
Nothing happened, right?

126
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,708
She's a kid, right?

127
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,539
lt's just a gun!
lt wasn't even fired!

128
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:05,702
Don't make it an issue!

129
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:09,681
You can go.

130
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,740
Mummy doesn't like violence.

131
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:15,843
After he married Mummy, Papa stopped all
his risky businesses and came here.

132
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:17,013
That's when l was born.

133
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,194
- Dude, check out the bike!

134
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:24,661
Check it out!

135
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:27,960
- So fast!

136
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,602
Notjust bikes.
My Papa does stunts with cars too!

137
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:32,593
She has been doing
this for a while now!

138
00:19:32,704 --> 00:19:35,138
As if there's nothing
that her Papa cannot do!

139
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,776
He is apparently more
glamourous than Dulquer Salmaan!

140
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:40,745
She came to scare us with
her grandpa's old gun!

141
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:43,177
When her Papa is called,
her Mummy comes to school.

142
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:46,581
He is even scared to meet the Principal.
And he's supposed to be a superhero?

143
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:48,082
Bose, awesome!

144
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:53,822
Good one, Bose!

145
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:04,348
Didn't you say that you'll
bring the Black Beast?

146
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:05,851
That's an off-roader, right?

147
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,991
There was a slight issue with
the workers at the site.

148
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:13,256
Their arms & legs are
like body-builders!

149
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,236
Was there a fight?

150
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:20,339
There was no fight; but there
was a fire-brand scene!

151
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,102
Will you narrate it to me?
- Oh! Sure!

152
00:22:35,053 --> 00:22:36,850
l felt so ashamed in
front of Maithreyan Sir.

153
00:22:37,155 --> 00:22:40,386
She is narrating all those fake stories
that you tell her, to the kids!

154
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:41,783
You're jealous, Mummy!

155
00:22:43,895 --> 00:22:45,419
You should buy a new
Louis Vuitton jacket.

156
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:47,322
Wear it when you come next time.

157
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:51,035
Very nice!

158
00:22:51,436 --> 00:22:53,028
Who wears all that in Kerala?

159
00:22:53,138 --> 00:22:56,232
ls it Papa's fault if others can't
pull off jackets & sunglasses?

160
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:57,968
My Sara should be happy.

161
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:01,035
For that, l will wearjackets, sunglasses
or whatever she wants me to wear!

162
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:05,211
Are you part of the land mafia?

163
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:06,718
Who? Me?

164
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:08,718
Those are just rumours
made by jealous people!

165
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,047
You can start a mafia
if you want to!

166
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:12,190
l like all that!

167
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:13,987
You are the one who
made her like this!

168
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:15,953
You should remember
that you are a girl!

169
00:23:16,027 --> 00:23:17,187
What's wrong if she's a girl?

170
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,386
Continue telling her stories.

171
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:22,933
You tell her some moral
science stories.

172
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:24,467
l can only narrate such stories.

173
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:28,735
lt's true that two women
can't be in the same house!

174
00:23:47,726 --> 00:23:48,954
What's the name of the drama?

175
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:51,286
Shakespeare's 'Cymbeline'.

176
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:56,126
The princess lmogen is
attacked by evil forces;

177
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:58,996
and herjourney to
escape from them.

178
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:00,864
lt is my own version.

179
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:03,330
So in short, no one would
understand anything, right?

180
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:05,210
Gokul,

181
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:07,012
your approach towards
art isn't right.

182
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:08,513
You people are always like this.

183
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:10,708
You'll pick something
from English literature and..

184
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:11,883
Make noises like these;

185
00:24:11,883 --> 00:24:14,085
and present it in a way
that no one understands!

186
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:15,985
And there are some idiots
who applaud even that!

187
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:17,489
Those who don't applaud
are tasteless fools!

188
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:19,787
Wait & watch!
l'm going to do 'Kathakali' this time!

189
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:21,856
As if that's very simple!

190
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,891
Why? You don't know Kathakali?
You don't know?

191
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:25,163
So sad!

192
00:24:26,364 --> 00:24:28,099
What about others?
-All are there.

193
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:30,335
Mimicry, 'Koodiyattam',
Mono-act and so on.

194
00:24:30,335 --> 00:24:32,166
l'm doing 2 items.
- We'll keep it at the end.

195
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:33,462
There won't be people then!

196
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:36,063
lf we start with it, you won't be there!
People will kill you!

197
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:38,510
l have actually learned
'Koodiyattam'.

198
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,307
So you should give
me some extra time.

199
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:41,580
l was a state champion!

200
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:44,174
Notjust that, 'Koodiyattam'
has been approved by UNESCO.

201
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:46,312
But l haven't approved it.

202
00:24:57,195 --> 00:24:58,162
l have to go.

203
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,197
Today,

204
00:24:59,464 --> 00:25:00,988
Mohanlal's film has released.

205
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:03,932
James, come to my cabin
with Prime file.

206
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:05,427
Didn't l tell you earlier?.

207
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:06,528
Today is her birthday.

208
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:08,396
l had promised a
dinner & movie to her.

209
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:10,305
Man is a social animal.

210
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:13,134
He realizes that only when he's
on the platform of marriage.

211
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:15,046
Nice!

212
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:41,606
'Dear Sara,

213
00:25:42,173 --> 00:25:45,006
'l'm writing a letterfor
the first time in my life.'

214
00:25:46,244 --> 00:25:48,303
'lt's my heart that's in here'

215
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:52,043
'When l reach school, l see if you
have reached, before anything else!'

216
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:57,255
'lf lravazhanjippuzha
is meant for the Arabian Sea;

217
00:25:57,255 --> 00:26:00,088
when you confess your love, l
will be able to tell you;

218
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:01,921
that Sara is meant forAshwin!'

219
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,028
'With love,
Ashwin'

220
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:09,424
What is it, Mummy?

221
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:11,035
What is this?

222
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:12,270
Love letter!

223
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:13,571
Love letter?

224
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:15,337
ls it so trivial?

225
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:17,600
Are we sending you to school
to study or to romance?

226
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:19,371
That's not my love letter.

227
00:26:19,644 --> 00:26:20,906
Ashwin gave it to me.

228
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,304
Why do you accept letters
from random boys?

229
00:26:24,115 --> 00:26:25,241
And did you tell us about it?

230
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:27,482
Did you complain to the teacher?
- lt's one-way!

231
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:29,213
And Daddy has told me that,

232
00:26:29,287 --> 00:26:31,084
l can romance whoever l want to!

233
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:32,223
Great!

234
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:34,321
So you both are in this together?

235
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:36,217
l'm not going to romance anyone.

236
00:26:36,494 --> 00:26:38,655
Only if l find someone like
Daddy, l will romance him.

237
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:40,188
- What's the matter?.

238
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:42,664
Papa, it's about that love letter.

239
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:43,901
Oh! That's all?

240
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:45,128
Did you hear what she said?

241
00:26:45,203 --> 00:26:46,966
She will romance someone
like you, it seems!

242
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:48,094
Am l so bad or what?

243
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:52,904
How come you're doing
some extra make-up?

244
00:26:52,978 --> 00:26:53,967
There's a reason!

245
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:12,223
'Hey little chicken, come and give us
a song like your cock-a-doodle-doo'

246
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:18,892
'Hey milkweed, come flying
silently and give us company'

247
00:27:21,072 --> 00:27:25,566
'Dressed up handsomely, drenched
in a rain of smiles, come on Papa'

248
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:32,372
'Smiling with your white teeth,
shaking your head, come this way'

249
00:27:48,633 --> 00:27:53,730
'Hey little chicken, come and give us
a song like your cock-a-doodle-doo'

250
00:27:55,407 --> 00:28:00,208
'Hey milkweed, come flying
silently and give us company'

251
00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:35,605
'Like Cinderella, l want
to fly high in the skies'

252
00:28:37,115 --> 00:28:39,606
'Twinkle Twinkle
little starry Sara'

253
00:28:40,251 --> 00:28:42,742
'While l am waiting in excitement'

254
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:44,247
'Come, Papa'

255
00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:47,591
'To fly high, come with me'

256
00:28:51,629 --> 00:28:55,497
'As we flew high, the yellow dove
& the gentle breeze sang along'

257
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:17,020
'Hey little chicken, come and give us
a song like your cock-a-doodle-doo'

258
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:23,358
'Hey milkweed, come flying
silently and give us company'

259
00:29:25,697 --> 00:29:30,293
'Dressed up handsomely, drenched
in a rain of smiles, come on Papa'

260
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:37,265
'Smiling with your white teeth,
shaking your head, come this way'

261
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,284
Greetings to all of you.

262
00:29:57,495 --> 00:29:58,757
The name of my story is,

263
00:29:58,830 --> 00:29:59,797
'Napoleon'

264
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:11,543
David, l'll miss it.

265
00:30:11,543 --> 00:30:12,811
There's an urgent board meeting.

266
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,369
lt's okay. Nothing much
is happening here.

267
00:30:14,445 --> 00:30:15,639
Everybody is drunk!

268
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:17,238
What about Sara?

269
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:18,612
lt'sjust a 5 minute
drive, right?

270
00:30:18,683 --> 00:30:19,650
Pick her up.

271
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:21,613
l'm the only sober person here.

272
00:30:21,786 --> 00:30:23,117
l have to be here.

273
00:30:24,722 --> 00:30:25,689
She has the key, right?

274
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:27,786
She will wait there.

275
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:52,292
The board meeting has been
postponed to tomorrow.

276
00:32:53,404 --> 00:32:54,371
Okay.

277
00:33:50,428 --> 00:33:51,520
What?
What happened?

278
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:53,797
Dear,

279
00:33:54,132 --> 00:33:55,099
What happened?

280
00:34:47,685 --> 00:34:48,947
- Hello!
Control Room.

281
00:35:42,006 --> 00:35:42,973
Where's Sara?

282
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:46,443
Where is Sara?

283
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:02,659
Dear..

284
00:36:16,207 --> 00:36:17,538
Who did this to my child?

285
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,872
David, we have to take
her to the hospital!

286
00:36:22,713 --> 00:36:23,737
Why to the hospital?

287
00:36:24,215 --> 00:36:25,978
You're notjust a mother,
but a doctor too!

288
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:27,479
Take care of her.

289
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:28,741
l want her back!

290
00:36:30,755 --> 00:36:32,552
We have to take her to
the hospital, David!

291
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:34,216
No, Michelle.
We shouldn't!

292
00:36:35,226 --> 00:36:38,559
l don't want herto be celebrated
as a victim by the media & public.

293
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:41,527
No one has to light
a candle for her.

294
00:36:42,633 --> 00:36:44,999
How would my child face her
friends and relatives?

295
00:36:46,637 --> 00:36:47,729
Take care of my child!

296
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:49,029
Take care of her!

297
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,174
Do what l say!

298
00:36:52,777 --> 00:36:56,008
There are monsters all around who want
to see disasters happening to others.

299
00:36:58,082 --> 00:36:59,572
She is raped brutally!

300
00:37:00,284 --> 00:37:02,184
We have to take her to the
hospital immediately!

301
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,883
My child has been torn apart!

302
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:07,758
l know!

303
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:08,984
l know, David!

304
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,727
Trust me!

305
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:12,755
l will take care of her.

306
00:37:14,632 --> 00:37:15,963
We have to take her, David!

307
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:18,830
l'm her mother, David!

308
00:39:30,801 --> 00:39:32,735
lt must be that Narayanan,
the Security guard.

309
00:39:41,779 --> 00:39:42,746
What?

310
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:47,277
What?
What's the matter?.

311
00:39:48,753 --> 00:39:50,687
A robbery happened in the
flat right above yours.

312
00:39:51,789 --> 00:39:53,086
Anything here?
- No!

313
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:55,019
Nothing is missing from here.

314
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,154
Sir, cigarettes for you.

315
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:01,265
Until you sent Narayanan
to buy cigarettes,

316
00:40:01,265 --> 00:40:02,800
the CCTV camera was connected.

317
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,166
Now, there's no connection &
even the hard disk is missing!

318
00:40:06,203 --> 00:40:07,170
David Sir,

319
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:08,995
l forgot to tell you.

320
00:40:09,173 --> 00:40:11,164
lt was Johnny Sir's
apartment which was robbed.

321
00:40:11,275 --> 00:40:12,799
You sent me to buy
cigarettes, right?

322
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,275
Until then, there
wasn't any problem!

323
00:40:15,479 --> 00:40:17,811
The camera connection is
just forthe sake of it.

324
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:19,074
Nothing gets recorded.

325
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:21,185
lt has been faulty for
the past 3 months.

326
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:22,152
You can leave now.

327
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:23,208
l'll come there.

328
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:26,717
You can also leave, Sir.

329
00:40:27,024 --> 00:40:27,991
What?

330
00:40:37,334 --> 00:40:38,301
Mr.David,

331
00:40:38,903 --> 00:40:40,871
you don't look like
someone who smokes.

332
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:49,302
Since the construction isn't complete,
only 3 floors are occupied.

333
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:51,777
Downstairs, there's
an advocate & family.

334
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:54,146
They are on tour for
the past 2 weeks, Sir.

335
00:40:55,252 --> 00:40:57,152
Then, that builder and wife.

336
00:40:57,488 --> 00:40:58,887
His wife is a doctor, Sir.

337
00:40:59,557 --> 00:41:01,422
They reach only around 6-7 PM.

338
00:42:19,403 --> 00:42:20,370
Police!

339
00:42:20,938 --> 00:42:21,905
Police?

340
00:42:22,506 --> 00:42:23,564
You are from the Police?

341
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,232
He is such a freak!

342
00:42:27,411 --> 00:42:28,901
Even freaks can
become policemen.

343
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:32,978
For that, the Government has
created a CBClD set-up.

344
00:42:33,117 --> 00:42:35,519
Are you showing off, breaking
into a boys' hostel at midnight?

345
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:37,043
What kind of a
policeman are you?

346
00:42:40,658 --> 00:42:41,920
That's what l'm saying.

347
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,491
From the past few
years in our state,

348
00:42:44,628 --> 00:42:47,597
minor children are
being subjected to rape,

349
00:42:47,665 --> 00:42:48,927
and murdered.

350
00:42:49,633 --> 00:42:51,498
To ensure that POCSO act
is enforced severely,

351
00:42:51,602 --> 00:42:53,092
An undercover movement.

352
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:55,304
l am a part of it.
- What do you want now?

353
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:02,906
But there are no cases charged
or arrests made for that.

354
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,578
But, watching child porn is..

355
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:10,552
Not just illegal,

356
00:43:11,121 --> 00:43:12,986
it's a mental disorder as well.

357
00:43:13,657 --> 00:43:16,093
We track people who
watch it regularly,

358
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:17,458
and give them counselling.

359
00:43:17,661 --> 00:43:18,992
Such people,

360
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:21,093
if not advised properly,

361
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:23,199
can cause trouble for our
department in future.

362
00:43:23,534 --> 00:43:27,265
So you want to catch the one who watches
child porn regularly amongst us, right?

363
00:43:28,672 --> 00:43:29,900
Just to advise him.

364
00:43:30,507 --> 00:43:31,599
Not going to happen, Sir!

365
00:43:31,675 --> 00:43:33,905
There a three vans full
of policemen, outside.

366
00:43:35,312 --> 00:43:37,143
There are 150 boys in this hostel.

367
00:43:37,214 --> 00:43:40,650
Just a whistle; and even we can't guarantee
in what condition you'll be going back.

368
00:44:12,549 --> 00:44:15,643
l haven't spoken even to my
mom so decently, you @#@$!$!!

369
00:46:04,128 --> 00:46:05,095
Mummy is here.

370
00:48:01,245 --> 00:48:02,212
Move away!

371
00:48:05,983 --> 00:48:06,950
Who is it?

372
00:48:07,417 --> 00:48:08,679
lt's me, Jose.

373
00:48:09,453 --> 00:48:10,511
Sathyettan!

374
00:48:10,821 --> 00:48:11,788
Dude,

375
00:48:11,989 --> 00:48:14,355
your lady officer
is quite a chick.

376
00:48:15,259 --> 00:48:17,227
Was she appointed
without any training?

377
00:48:17,294 --> 00:48:18,921
She hasn't withered at all!
- What?

378
00:48:19,296 --> 00:48:20,593
Even with the scorching hot sun,

379
00:48:20,964 --> 00:48:22,795
nothing has withered.

380
00:48:24,334 --> 00:48:25,665
And, how is your new boss?

381
00:48:25,836 --> 00:48:27,504
He is an expert at expletives!

382
00:48:27,504 --> 00:48:28,839
His tongue is filthy,

383
00:48:28,839 --> 00:48:30,431
and fists are deadly!

384
00:48:39,483 --> 00:48:40,780
Who is this Arnold?

385
00:48:40,984 --> 00:48:42,451
This is my new boss.

386
00:48:45,555 --> 00:48:47,182
l'll be right back.
- l'm coming, too.

387
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:54,890
Just because you're undercover, you
think you can do anything you want?

388
00:48:57,668 --> 00:48:59,192
A dead body is a good omen!

389
00:49:02,873 --> 00:49:04,204
When did you come?

390
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:06,208
Within half an hour after
the crime was reported.

391
00:49:06,476 --> 00:49:08,410
Didn't you have breakfast?
- Yes, Sir.

392
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:10,345
Doesn't look like it.

393
00:49:10,547 --> 00:49:11,707
Be a little more energetic!

394
00:50:06,536 --> 00:50:08,834
Has any missing case been
reported in the past 2 days?

395
00:50:10,107 --> 00:50:11,074
No Sir.

396
00:50:11,308 --> 00:50:12,275
Who said so?

397
00:50:12,576 --> 00:50:14,305
l'm telling you that
a case was reported.

398
00:50:15,045 --> 00:50:17,275
As far as l know..
- l didn't ask what you know.

399
00:50:17,381 --> 00:50:19,508
l asked you whether any
case was reported or not!

400
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:21,884
Why are you confirming
things that you don't know?

401
00:50:25,088 --> 00:50:26,385
She is quite fair & plump.

402
00:50:26,656 --> 00:50:27,714
Must be from a rich family.

403
00:50:28,425 --> 00:50:29,392
Sure!

404
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:30,719
There will be a case.

405
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:34,721
Madam, just a minute.

406
00:50:36,133 --> 00:50:37,100
Get lost.

407
00:50:37,734 --> 00:50:38,826
What is this, man?

408
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:40,094
Was raped, right?

409
00:50:40,604 --> 00:50:41,571
What?

410
00:50:41,671 --> 00:50:43,434
Well, that girl..
She was raped, right?

411
00:50:44,107 --> 00:50:46,439
This is the 5th or 6th one, madam!
Did you find any lead?

412
00:50:49,846 --> 00:50:51,313
Go!
- You screwed it all up!

413
00:50:55,986 --> 00:50:57,817
Get me the memory
card of his camera.

414
00:50:57,988 --> 00:50:58,989
No need, madam!

415
00:50:58,989 --> 00:50:59,956
He is a douche-bag!

416
00:51:00,023 --> 00:51:01,650
Even though he works
for a national daily,

417
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:03,124
he is a yellow
journalist at heart!

418
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:05,555
His main job is writing soft
porn for a fortnightly.

419
00:51:05,695 --> 00:51:07,390
We don't have to mess with him.

420
00:51:17,374 --> 00:51:19,433
Samuel Sir was
investigating these cases.

421
00:51:20,177 --> 00:51:21,735
And now he's a gone case, right?

422
00:51:22,779 --> 00:51:26,078
His car was deliberately hit by
another vehicle and pushed down.

423
00:51:27,684 --> 00:51:28,785
He was drunk, right?

424
00:51:28,785 --> 00:51:29,752
Well..

425
00:51:29,853 --> 00:51:31,650
lf you drink & drive,
such things can happen!

426
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:35,084
According to circumstantial
evidences, it's an executed one!

427
00:51:35,659 --> 00:51:36,626
What circumstance?

428
00:51:36,693 --> 00:51:38,558
He is a dangerous psychopath.

429
00:51:38,962 --> 00:51:40,564
Only children under 15 years..

430
00:51:40,564 --> 00:51:42,657
He is a killer who rapes & murders them!
l know!

431
00:51:42,966 --> 00:51:43,933
What else?

432
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,001
Notjust that,

433
00:51:45,001 --> 00:51:46,935
he used to call Samuel
Sir on his phone.

434
00:51:47,003 --> 00:51:49,539
He used to behave & talk like a
sadist trying to torture

435
00:51:49,539 --> 00:51:53,643
a gentleman police officer like Samuel
Sir, who had a great track record.

436
00:51:53,643 --> 00:51:55,941
And that man wanted to
defeat Samuel Sirtoo!

437
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:01,709
During the last phone call, he
had really provoked Samuel Sir.

438
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:06,756
Samuel Sir must have
identified that killer.

439
00:52:08,024 --> 00:52:08,991
But what to do!

440
00:52:09,526 --> 00:52:11,153
He drank & drove
and dropped dead!

441
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:15,728
l have some assumptions
about the latest murder.

442
00:52:16,099 --> 00:52:17,066
Okay. Tell me.

443
00:52:18,101 --> 00:52:20,001
The murder didn't
happen at that place.

444
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:22,706
So he would've used a vehicle
to take the body there, right?

445
00:52:22,706 --> 00:52:25,675
lf we are able to find that vehicle,
we can nab the killer easily!

446
00:52:25,742 --> 00:52:28,142
These days, when there are
CCTV cameras at every street,

447
00:52:28,211 --> 00:52:29,746
it's not such a difficult task!

448
00:52:29,746 --> 00:52:31,043
Very good!
Sit down.

449
00:52:35,752 --> 00:52:38,588
l examined all the CCTV cameras
of that part of the city.

450
00:52:38,588 --> 00:52:42,046
Around 1518 vehicles
could've carried the body.

451
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:44,559
From an auto-rickshaw to a lorry!
- Which one among them?

452
00:52:44,961 --> 00:52:45,928
That..

453
00:52:47,597 --> 00:52:49,588
l don't know that, Sir.
We have to find out.

454
00:52:51,768 --> 00:52:53,235
Are you really an idiot,

455
00:52:53,603 --> 00:52:54,831
orjust acting like one?

456
00:52:55,472 --> 00:52:56,439
No, Sir.

457
00:52:56,573 --> 00:52:57,938
l'm not acting, Sir.
Definitely not!

458
00:52:58,141 --> 00:53:00,701
l said all these with a perfect
understanding of the situation.

459
00:53:24,768 --> 00:53:25,757
You didn't wish me.

460
00:54:46,182 --> 00:54:51,552
'Somewhere'

461
00:54:52,989 --> 00:54:58,621
'Shattered'

462
00:54:59,896 --> 00:55:06,096
'Was the dreamy laughter
of my little child'

463
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:12,571
'Kindling flames in
yourfather's heart'

464
00:55:12,676 --> 00:55:14,906
'Away'

465
00:55:15,912 --> 00:55:18,642
'Far away'

466
00:55:19,215 --> 00:55:26,280
'As a twilight of
pain disappears'

467
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:36,362
Salma reaches the apartment
around 4 PM daily.

468
00:55:37,033 --> 00:55:38,898
Both of us are working.

469
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:41,864
We reach home only
around 6 or 7 PM.

470
00:55:42,405 --> 00:55:43,997
We thought that she would be here.

471
00:55:44,441 --> 00:55:46,909
But she didn't board the
school bus that day.

472
00:55:47,143 --> 00:55:48,974
She went missing just
before boarding the bus.

473
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:51,214
Did she have any unwanted friendship,

474
00:55:51,214 --> 00:55:52,738
or phone conversations?

475
00:55:53,116 --> 00:55:55,744
Nothing that we know of.

476
00:55:55,985 --> 00:55:58,920
lf she went missing before
she boarded the school bus,

477
00:55:59,255 --> 00:56:01,246
the bus driver should
inform you, right?

478
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:04,718
From 4 PM,

479
00:56:05,462 --> 00:56:06,895
they had been calling us.

480
00:56:07,731 --> 00:56:08,959
We couldn't attend the calls.

481
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:11,267
Great!

482
00:56:12,769 --> 00:56:14,634
lf you find something unusual,

483
00:56:38,328 --> 00:56:40,694
You know how much Papa &
Mummy love you, right?

484
00:56:43,199 --> 00:56:45,064
We have only you in this world.

485
00:56:47,937 --> 00:56:49,905
Didn't l tell you that you
shouldn't be like this?

486
00:56:53,476 --> 00:56:55,103
Nothing happened
to you, my dear.

487
00:56:55,979 --> 00:56:57,810
We want you to get
back to your old self.

488
00:57:02,786 --> 00:57:04,777
Your Papa will always be
with you hereafter, Sara.

489
00:57:17,167 --> 00:57:18,225
Who was it?

490
00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:23,032
That day..
Over there..

491
00:57:23,473 --> 00:57:24,440
Who was it?

492
00:58:18,261 --> 00:58:26,930
'O' dreamy cloud, waving
your hands and moving forward'

493
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:33,031
'Why are you hiding far away?'

494
00:58:34,043 --> 00:58:42,473
'O' tender breeze, waving your
hands and moving forward'

495
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:48,552
'Won't you come back ever again?'

496
00:58:49,592 --> 00:58:52,493
lf you are always depressed, how
will your Papa & Mummy feel?

497
00:58:53,396 --> 00:58:54,363
Look.

498
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:58,060
Your Mummy is one of
the best doctors here.

499
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:02,232
Since she thinks that you're unwell, she
is not even paying attention to her work.

500
00:59:04,073 --> 00:59:05,802
Do you understand
what l'm saying?

501
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:09,405
You are a smart girl!

502
00:59:09,946 --> 00:59:11,413
We see so many dreams, right?

503
00:59:11,848 --> 00:59:13,475
But after some time,
don't we forget them?

504
00:59:14,317 --> 00:59:16,285
Like that, you should forget this too.

505
00:59:17,353 --> 00:59:19,287
And, make your Papa & Mummy happy!

506
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:23,984
Have you thought about your Papa?

507
00:59:24,661 --> 00:59:26,288
You can see his love for you, right?

508
00:59:28,298 --> 00:59:29,265
l know,

509
00:59:29,499 --> 00:59:31,194
that Papa & Mummy are really sad.

510
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:34,263
Papa is my best friend.

511
00:59:36,506 --> 00:59:38,474
l love both of them so much!

512
00:59:40,643 --> 00:59:41,610
l am scared!

513
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:44,380
Scared of everyone!

514
00:59:46,282 --> 00:59:47,476
He hurt me a lot!

515
00:59:48,685 --> 00:59:50,152
l tried to run away!

516
00:59:51,387 --> 00:59:52,877
He covered my mouth.

517
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:55,923
And hurt me a lot.

518
00:59:57,193 --> 00:59:58,558
He tore my uniform apart.

519
01:00:00,029 --> 01:00:01,326
He broke my rosary.

520
01:00:04,133 --> 01:00:05,293
l got really scared.

521
01:00:07,637 --> 01:00:08,934
Papa tells me that

522
01:00:10,006 --> 01:00:11,303
nothing has happened to me.

523
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:15,109
l am still scared.

524
01:00:17,313 --> 01:00:19,304
When Papa isn't around,
if it happens again..

525
01:00:22,986 --> 01:00:24,613
Papa & Mummy have to
go for work, right?

526
01:00:27,523 --> 01:00:28,888
l saw Papa crying.

527
01:00:32,362 --> 01:00:34,660
He is crying because l
am not feeling well.

528
01:00:43,539 --> 01:00:45,234
No Aunty!
l won't cry hereafter.

529
01:00:49,379 --> 01:00:50,971
l won't make Papa & Mummy cry.

530
01:00:53,516 --> 01:00:55,211
Papa should be with me.
Always!

531
01:00:56,119 --> 01:00:57,086
Or else,

532
01:00:57,186 --> 01:00:58,551
at least until my fear is gone.

533
01:00:58,621 --> 01:01:00,054
lf something happens to me,

534
01:01:01,057 --> 01:01:03,321
Papa says that a superhero
would come & save me.

535
01:01:03,993 --> 01:01:07,258
But nobody came to save me.
Neither Papa nor Jesus.

536
01:01:10,566 --> 01:01:12,261
Jesus will punish the
man who hurt me.

537
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:13,636
l'm sure!

538
01:01:40,096 --> 01:01:42,656
We have to take a decision on the
Mountain Valley project immediately.

539
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,230
Ravi, l'm not in a mood right now.
Shall we talk later?

540
01:01:55,011 --> 01:01:57,241
l never imagined that this
world would be like this.

541
01:01:59,482 --> 01:02:01,780
l used to read & hear about
incidents happening around me.

542
01:02:02,351 --> 01:02:04,216
But when l was away for a moment,

543
01:02:05,521 --> 01:02:06,488
my child...

544
01:02:08,658 --> 01:02:11,092
l have never hurt her even by
holding her hand tight so far.

545
01:02:15,131 --> 01:02:17,156
l just want my child's
face to be pleasant.

546
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:18,494
l just want her to forget it!

547
01:02:20,303 --> 01:02:21,497
Everything will be all right.

548
01:02:24,307 --> 01:02:25,604
l just want my child to smile!

549
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:30,739
We are living and
earning for that, right?

550
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:35,617
All of us!

551
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:39,654
When her face turns
dull, our hearts ache!

552
01:02:41,657 --> 01:02:44,057
My wife gets all worked up
if the school bus is late.

553
01:02:45,795 --> 01:02:47,285
She cries when l'm not looking.

554
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:52,400
She would be scared that
l may be crushed.

555
01:02:56,072 --> 01:02:57,471
No, Susan.
l'm all right.

556
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:01,768
ln this world,

557
01:03:02,678 --> 01:03:04,509
no God came to the
rescue of my child.

558
01:03:11,521 --> 01:03:14,183
l cannot be with her
all the time, right?

559
01:03:17,660 --> 01:03:19,628
She escaped because
of sheer luck.

560
01:03:23,366 --> 01:03:25,129
That b@$@$d could've killed her.

561
01:03:29,672 --> 01:03:30,832
She was in a lot of pain.

562
01:03:31,107 --> 01:03:32,665
'Your silences burn like lava'

563
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:37,769
'Will you hum like a bird in my ears?'

564
01:03:38,714 --> 01:03:43,651
'With a shower of tears,

565
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:49,584
l will turn you into a
glowing moon-fly again'

566
01:03:50,426 --> 01:03:55,830
'l will come running to you
whenever you think of me'

567
01:03:56,332 --> 01:04:01,099
'l will always keep
guarding you, my dear'

568
01:04:01,304 --> 01:04:04,102
'Do not hesitate'

569
01:04:04,307 --> 01:04:06,832
'Do not fear'

570
01:04:07,143 --> 01:04:12,513
'Smile, my baby'

571
01:04:16,719 --> 01:04:20,815
'Somewhere'

572
01:04:22,658 --> 01:04:28,358
'Shattered'

573
01:04:47,450 --> 01:04:48,417
He was a Joker.

574
01:05:52,481 --> 01:05:54,608
He said that he will kill
3 children this month,

575
01:05:54,850 --> 01:05:56,647
in his last call
to Samuel, right?

576
01:05:57,653 --> 01:05:58,620
One is fine.

577
01:06:00,256 --> 01:06:01,553
There are 2 more chances.

578
01:06:02,858 --> 01:06:04,527
Just because Sam is dead,

579
01:06:04,527 --> 01:06:06,256
will he back out from
achieving his target?

580
01:06:06,929 --> 01:06:08,864
Or has he already killed
2 of them somewhere?

581
01:06:08,864 --> 01:06:10,627
lf he has done it, he
will let us know.

582
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:13,958
We shall wait, right?

583
01:06:14,670 --> 01:06:16,262
There are many more
days in this month.

584
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:19,041
Anyway, he is a good poet.

585
01:06:19,041 --> 01:06:20,941
He kills each one of
them by singing a song.

586
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:22,945
He would be..

587
01:06:23,346 --> 01:06:24,836
You don't have to go
looking for him.

588
01:06:25,014 --> 01:06:26,276
lf you are talented,

589
01:06:26,349 --> 01:06:27,646
he will come looking for you.

590
01:08:30,873 --> 01:08:32,807
Did you get the report on those gloves?
- No Sir.

591
01:08:33,676 --> 01:08:35,678
l haven't received any
update from forensics, Sir.

592
01:08:35,678 --> 01:08:38,442
All the files related to the case
history should be on my table, now!

593
01:08:38,547 --> 01:08:39,980
Whichever department it may be from!

594
01:08:50,593 --> 01:08:53,153
He has talked overthe phone
with Sir around 15 times.

595
01:08:54,864 --> 01:08:57,662
The investigations focusing on the
lDs used to get the sim cards,

596
01:08:57,733 --> 01:08:59,928
reached people who have
nothing to do with the case.

597
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:02,661
The first couple of murders happened
in ldukki district.

598
01:09:03,205 --> 01:09:04,832
And the third one was in Ernakulam.

599
01:09:06,008 --> 01:09:09,444
Samuel Sir was the one who realized the
presence of a serial killer behind this.

600
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:13,639
The DNA reports are
not consistent.

601
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:17,219
Body hair, bite marks; all are
different at different places.

602
01:09:19,021 --> 01:09:20,852
Unlike other serial killers,

603
01:09:21,223 --> 01:09:24,056
he doesn't follow a particular
modus operandi in his murders.

604
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:28,964
The murders are committed by injecting
drugs or suffocating them.

605
01:09:28,964 --> 01:09:31,057
Some children were
tortured for days!

606
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:32,167
That means,

607
01:09:32,735 --> 01:09:34,202
he must have a hide-out.

608
01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:40,567
And someone who is hiding, would
definitely be a psuedo-gentleman.

609
01:09:43,612 --> 01:09:45,781
He ties a band
around their mouths,

610
01:09:45,781 --> 01:09:47,544
and fits nose-caps
on their noses,

611
01:09:47,616 --> 01:09:49,243
and displays their
bodies like clowns!

612
01:10:24,687 --> 01:10:25,654
What is this?

613
01:10:27,990 --> 01:10:29,082
What is all this?

614
01:10:31,594 --> 01:10:33,824
lt was God who saved our
child's life, Michelle!

615
01:10:34,997 --> 01:10:36,021
Notjust her..

616
01:10:36,765 --> 01:10:37,754
Did you see all these?

617
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,262
'Sexual violence against children.
945 cases in 6 months'

618
01:10:40,069 --> 01:10:41,136
'Student molested.
Security guard arrested'

619
01:10:41,136 --> 01:10:42,899
'Tied up & raped.
Search is on for 3 accused'

620
01:10:46,875 --> 01:10:48,103
When we are not around,

621
01:10:48,177 --> 01:10:49,576
it shouldn't happen again..

622
01:10:49,812 --> 01:10:50,744
No one should..

623
01:10:53,682 --> 01:10:55,149
l'm not able to
face my daughter.

624
01:10:58,621 --> 01:11:00,088
lt's easy to live
for our wishes.

625
01:11:01,223 --> 01:11:04,090
But to live for our children's
wishes, is a blessing!

626
01:11:05,661 --> 01:11:07,253
She is not saying
anything now, Michelle.

627
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:09,761
She is not telling me
any of her wishes.

628
01:11:11,734 --> 01:11:12,996
Who did this to our daughter?

629
01:11:14,570 --> 01:11:15,628
l have to find out.

630
01:11:18,307 --> 01:11:20,104
Whoever it is, l will find him!

631
01:11:22,778 --> 01:11:23,745
Kill him!

632
01:11:27,149 --> 01:11:28,173
lf cancer spreads,

633
01:11:29,051 --> 01:11:30,348
it should be burnt or severed.

634
01:11:31,186 --> 01:11:32,312
Even if it's inside a body,

635
01:11:32,721 --> 01:11:33,949
or in the society!

636
01:11:36,225 --> 01:11:37,192
Kill him!

637
01:12:53,736 --> 01:12:54,703
Hi David!

638
01:12:54,770 --> 01:12:56,138
How come you're
late today, Johnny?

639
01:12:56,138 --> 01:12:58,907
l went to the police station. They
said they're still investigating.

640
01:12:58,907 --> 01:13:00,204
But they haven't found anything.

641
01:13:00,909 --> 01:13:05,314
The thief entered our house when that
fraud security guard Narayanan stepped out.

642
01:13:05,314 --> 01:13:09,216
Someone who knows that my dad & mom
are alone there, has done this!

643
01:13:10,252 --> 01:13:11,453
Where were you then?

644
01:13:11,453 --> 01:13:13,148
l came here only after
knowing about it.

645
01:13:13,722 --> 01:13:14,689
When l reached here,

646
01:13:14,757 --> 01:13:17,419
mom's gold chain and
Rs.25,000 were missing.

647
01:13:17,793 --> 01:13:19,420
Only that much was there
in that apartment.

648
01:13:19,962 --> 01:13:21,759
Your sister's children
don't come here now?

649
01:13:22,464 --> 01:13:24,864
Why are you questioning
me like a policeman?

650
01:13:24,933 --> 01:13:26,298
Those guys are in Bangalore!

651
01:13:26,835 --> 01:13:28,427
Annie says that they
have become better.

652
01:13:28,804 --> 01:13:30,203
lt's been long since
they came here.

653
01:13:31,039 --> 01:13:33,166
Well, why do you seem
like you have a doubt?

654
01:13:33,342 --> 01:13:35,071
Where were you when it happened?

655
01:13:35,177 --> 01:13:36,201
There you go again!

656
01:13:36,345 --> 01:13:38,147
From the way you're asking,

657
01:13:38,147 --> 01:13:40,115
it seems like l robbed
my own apartment.

658
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:44,409
l will tell you where l was on that
day, when it is the right time.

659
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:45,987
Okay?

660
01:13:49,057 --> 01:13:50,285
l said what l know.

661
01:13:50,826 --> 01:13:53,192
For 10 minutes, l stepped
out to have tea.

662
01:13:53,262 --> 01:13:54,263
But Sir,

663
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:55,457
was something stolen from here?

664
01:13:55,731 --> 01:13:57,790
l don't want to know what
you told the police.

665
01:14:01,970 --> 01:14:06,703
For quite some time now, you bosses have
some grudge against security guards!

666
01:14:07,242 --> 01:14:09,233
l don't have the medicine forthat, Sir.

667
01:14:18,153 --> 01:14:20,451
Prakash is my brother-in-law, Sir.

668
01:14:20,756 --> 01:14:23,025
He came to visit
this place one day.

669
01:14:23,025 --> 01:14:26,188
When he heard that the camera
wasn't working here, he planned it.

670
01:14:29,498 --> 01:14:31,056
Don't hit me again, Sir.

671
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:33,191
lt's my elder daughter's
wedding in February.

672
01:14:33,535 --> 01:14:34,797
l made a mistake!

673
01:14:34,870 --> 01:14:38,306
l got Rs.25,000 and that
grandma's gold chain.

674
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:40,806
l will return all of it, Sir.

675
01:15:28,924 --> 01:15:31,593
While l was running out of Johnny Sir's
apartment with whatever l got,

676
01:15:31,593 --> 01:15:32,961
l saw a man with a mask.

677
01:15:32,961 --> 01:15:34,121
Ajoker's mask.

678
01:15:35,464 --> 01:15:37,199
He was doing something
in the lift.

679
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:38,359
He looked at me suddenly.

680
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:40,830
When l saw him looking at
me, l ran away from there!

681
01:15:40,936 --> 01:15:42,062
That's all l know, Sir.

682
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:43,505
Nothing else.

683
01:15:44,473 --> 01:15:46,065
Oh my God!

684
01:16:51,540 --> 01:16:53,508
Ooh! So muscular!

685
01:17:06,355 --> 01:17:10,917
Sir, these are the accused and ex-convicts
in child molestation cases in this city.

686
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:12,654
First one is Franco.

687
01:17:13,695 --> 01:17:14,992
He was a tuition teacher.

688
01:17:15,263 --> 01:17:18,426
He served time in jail for molesting
3 children who were in his class.

689
01:17:19,368 --> 01:17:20,426
He is in town now.

690
01:17:30,746 --> 01:17:32,043
l tried to reform myself.

691
01:17:32,347 --> 01:17:33,515
But when l think about it,

692
01:17:33,515 --> 01:17:34,982
l don't feel any
of that was wrong.

693
01:17:36,218 --> 01:17:37,185
Even otherwise,

694
01:17:37,419 --> 01:17:39,387
can we humans decide
what's right or wrong?

695
01:17:41,556 --> 01:17:43,490
lt's not because my parents
didn't raise me well.

696
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:46,025
l was a topper in studies.

697
01:17:46,094 --> 01:17:47,229
Even in teaching.

698
01:17:47,229 --> 01:17:48,218
What do you do now?

699
01:17:49,464 --> 01:17:50,590
The tuition centre is shut!

700
01:17:51,566 --> 01:17:53,363
What you're talking about;
l haven't done it.

701
01:17:53,468 --> 01:17:54,435
But..

702
01:17:55,637 --> 01:17:57,696
l'm getting what l want in plenty!

703
01:17:59,241 --> 01:18:00,333
So you haven't reformed!

704
01:18:01,243 --> 01:18:02,505
l was always okay, Sir.

705
01:18:03,278 --> 01:18:04,245
And ya,

706
01:18:04,379 --> 01:18:06,040
the problem is with
your point of view.

707
01:18:06,782 --> 01:18:09,580
lt was said that l had unnatural
sex and l was jailed for 2 years!

708
01:18:11,053 --> 01:18:12,611
l have a special interest
towards children.

709
01:18:14,122 --> 01:18:17,216
Dogs, humans and wolves were
formed from the same atom.

710
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:20,093
So there is nothing
unnatural in this, Sir.

711
01:18:21,196 --> 01:18:22,527
l have learnt a lot about this.

712
01:18:23,632 --> 01:18:26,499
Pedophiles get attracted to
the skin texture of children,

713
01:18:26,635 --> 01:18:27,659
and their smell.

714
01:18:27,736 --> 01:18:29,169
l don't feel anything like that.

715
01:18:29,271 --> 01:18:30,431
Just some pleasure for myself.

716
01:18:31,006 --> 01:18:31,973
That's all!

717
01:18:35,377 --> 01:18:36,344
Well,

718
01:18:36,478 --> 01:18:38,105
what are you guys
going to do to me?

719
01:18:55,263 --> 01:18:56,491
That bloody Paulo!

720
01:18:56,798 --> 01:18:57,765
Pervert!

721
01:18:58,300 --> 01:18:59,301
Sir,

722
01:18:59,301 --> 01:19:01,269
people are scared to send
their kids to school!

723
01:19:01,403 --> 01:19:03,234
He gets drunk and
pops out of nowhere.

724
01:19:03,672 --> 01:19:04,798
Notjust children,

725
01:19:05,507 --> 01:19:07,668
women here can't even dry
their undergarments outside.

726
01:19:07,743 --> 01:19:09,335
lf he sees it, he will
take it with him.

727
01:19:09,411 --> 01:19:11,113
Women are afraid to step outside.

728
01:19:11,113 --> 01:19:12,478
Such a pervert!

729
01:19:15,784 --> 01:19:18,480
lf you take him, make sure
that he never comes back.

730
01:19:19,721 --> 01:19:22,155
Don't let him know what
l said about him.

731
01:19:22,224 --> 01:19:23,521
lf you tell him,

732
01:19:23,792 --> 01:19:26,158
he might try to come
on to me at midnight.

733
01:19:28,263 --> 01:19:29,594
Didn't you check
that whole area?

734
01:19:29,664 --> 01:19:30,832
Yes Sir.
We couldn't find him.

735
01:19:30,832 --> 01:19:32,299
Don't stutter when Sir asks you.

736
01:19:36,171 --> 01:19:37,138
Thanks.

737
01:19:40,242 --> 01:19:41,402
He will be there!

738
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:43,168
At Solomon's house.

739
01:19:43,445 --> 01:19:45,106
Solomon's wife is
his mistress now.

740
01:19:45,313 --> 01:19:46,610
Go ahead, Sir!

741
01:19:47,215 --> 01:19:48,614
Go & show the power of police.

742
01:19:50,418 --> 01:19:51,646
He is not here, Sir.

743
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:53,187
We searched every nook & corner.

744
01:19:53,255 --> 01:19:54,483
l think he's absconding.

745
01:19:54,723 --> 01:19:56,156
l just saw him overthere.

746
01:19:58,160 --> 01:20:01,186
l don't know if it's because three of
us come together; we always screw up!

747
01:20:01,530 --> 01:20:03,361
Who's that eagle who snatched him?

748
01:20:09,204 --> 01:20:11,604
Who is driving a car like
this through this slum?

749
01:20:21,850 --> 01:20:23,078
lt won't be erect hereafter!

750
01:20:23,151 --> 01:20:24,419
That's how you have kicked him!

751
01:20:24,419 --> 01:20:25,647
lt was a little too cruel.

752
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:26,744
What's so cruel?

753
01:20:27,389 --> 01:20:28,515
He deserves much more!

754
01:20:29,291 --> 01:20:31,350
He'll say that he fell down somewhere.
Right?

755
01:20:32,928 --> 01:20:33,929
Look!

756
01:20:33,929 --> 01:20:35,564
ls this a season for this or what?

757
01:20:35,564 --> 01:20:37,293
They're also saying
that they fell down.

758
01:20:37,566 --> 01:20:40,467
Someone with precise knowledge about
nerves and muscles has thulped them.

759
01:20:40,869 --> 01:20:42,131
Just like you did.

760
01:20:46,741 --> 01:20:47,708
Sir,

761
01:20:47,909 --> 01:20:50,207
these are the second & third
guys we were looking for.

762
01:20:50,312 --> 01:20:52,405
So someone is on the
job, much ahead of us!

763
01:21:29,818 --> 01:21:31,183
Look at his attire!

764
01:21:31,253 --> 01:21:32,550
Who does he think he is?
James Bond?

765
01:21:38,994 --> 01:21:41,963
How do these guys even wear such
clothes when it's so hot outside?

766
01:21:42,664 --> 01:21:43,961
AC, man, AC!

767
01:21:44,432 --> 01:21:46,923
Car has AC,
home has AC, office has AC.

768
01:21:47,669 --> 01:21:49,603
These guys never feel the heat!

769
01:21:56,011 --> 01:21:56,978
ls Anto here?

770
01:21:58,413 --> 01:22:00,315
What's the matter?

771
01:22:00,315 --> 01:22:02,943
l want to take Anto with me,
and ask him some questions.

772
01:22:03,318 --> 01:22:06,378
Anto, someone has come
here to take you with him.

773
01:22:22,671 --> 01:22:23,695
What's the matter, Sir?

774
01:22:23,838 --> 01:22:25,499
ls it to beat up someone
or get beaten up?

775
01:22:27,609 --> 01:22:29,678
Anto, let's talk privately.

776
01:22:29,678 --> 01:22:30,667
Can you come with me?

777
01:22:33,715 --> 01:22:35,317
l want certain details
about someone.

778
01:22:35,317 --> 01:22:36,682
Someone with a
criminal background.

779
01:22:36,851 --> 01:22:40,912
l want to know if there is such a person in
your gang or any other gang that you know.

780
01:22:41,389 --> 01:22:42,651
l'll tell you the rest later.

781
01:22:43,692 --> 01:22:44,784
So that's the matter!

782
01:22:44,926 --> 01:22:47,292
You've approached a criminal
to find another criminal?

783
01:22:47,462 --> 01:22:48,827
A police method.

784
01:22:49,698 --> 01:22:51,928
This Anto will not
betray his kind!

785
01:22:52,968 --> 01:22:55,436
Even if the police asks
me, l don't say anything.

786
01:22:55,537 --> 01:22:57,835
That's because policemen don't
ask the way l would ask you!

787
01:22:58,873 --> 01:23:00,575
Just because of your attire,

788
01:23:00,575 --> 01:23:02,270
l will call you 'Sir' forthe last time.

789
01:23:02,344 --> 01:23:03,971
Get into your car, Sir.
Clear off!

790
01:23:06,915 --> 01:23:08,314
Do you know how to drive, Anto?

791
01:23:13,321 --> 01:23:14,310
Stop!

792
01:23:14,556 --> 01:23:15,955
Stop the car!

793
01:23:23,098 --> 01:23:24,360
You don't know me!

794
01:23:24,466 --> 01:23:27,526
Did you think that you will
mess with me and get away?

795
01:23:28,837 --> 01:23:31,863
There are 24 cases in my name, and
they're not for stealing bananas!

796
01:23:32,574 --> 01:23:33,939
You don't know me well enough!

797
01:23:50,692 --> 01:23:52,127
Masks & disguises,

798
01:23:52,127 --> 01:23:54,789
and people who get turned
on when they see children,

799
01:23:54,863 --> 01:23:55,887
are not part of our gang.

800
01:23:55,997 --> 01:23:57,732
There was an Aziz in Kacheripady.

801
01:23:57,732 --> 01:24:00,530
A sicko who lifts his clothes to show
his private parts to schoolkids.

802
01:24:00,602 --> 01:24:01,967
He got convicted
in some rape case,

803
01:24:02,437 --> 01:24:03,836
and has been in jail
for a year now.

804
01:24:07,008 --> 01:24:08,407
This is the first time,

805
01:24:08,710 --> 01:24:10,473
that someone has
thulped me so badly.

806
01:24:10,612 --> 01:24:11,738
l won't forget it , Sir.

807
01:24:11,913 --> 01:24:13,312
May your memory protect you.

808
01:24:14,616 --> 01:24:16,550
My fists can bring good fortune!

809
01:24:16,985 --> 01:24:17,974
You'll get used to this!

810
01:24:18,653 --> 01:24:19,915
You better find out;

811
01:24:19,988 --> 01:24:21,387
How this Anto is,

812
01:24:21,456 --> 01:24:22,724
and how l operate;

813
01:24:22,724 --> 01:24:23,850
everyone knows it!

814
01:24:25,527 --> 01:24:27,427
But even l don't know
how l am right now!

815
01:24:44,946 --> 01:24:48,404
l have heard that girls tend to
be more fond of their father.

816
01:24:49,184 --> 01:24:50,776
My child was scared of me.

817
01:24:51,886 --> 01:24:54,480
She never told me
what she wanted.

818
01:24:56,157 --> 01:24:58,591
Only after we lost
her, my wife told me;

819
01:24:59,494 --> 01:25:01,724
that my daughter wanted to
tell me about so many things!

820
01:25:03,631 --> 01:25:04,598
Now,

821
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:06,565
Do you suspect anyone?

822
01:25:08,970 --> 01:25:10,437
Why are you asking such questions?

823
01:25:10,705 --> 01:25:12,107
What do you have to
do with all this?

824
01:25:12,107 --> 01:25:13,768
Didn't l tell you?
l'm a writer as well.

825
01:25:14,509 --> 01:25:17,945
l want to do a feature on these children
who're confined only to newspapers.

826
01:25:18,546 --> 01:25:20,849
'The world will not be destroyed
by those who do evil,

827
01:25:20,849 --> 01:25:22,942
but by those who watch them
without doing anything';

828
01:25:23,017 --> 01:25:24,552
l have read this somewhere.

829
01:25:24,552 --> 01:25:25,678
What are you trying to say?

830
01:25:25,753 --> 01:25:26,720
Wazim,

831
01:25:30,191 --> 01:25:31,658
Aren't you a builder?

832
01:25:47,442 --> 01:25:48,409
Who is he?

833
01:25:48,877 --> 01:25:50,174
What is he asking?

834
01:25:50,745 --> 01:25:52,042
Why are you telling
him everything?

835
01:25:52,947 --> 01:25:54,175
Let me send him out.

836
01:26:22,277 --> 01:26:25,046
This city's sunrise and sunset
happens on David's land.

837
01:26:25,046 --> 01:26:28,243
The CCTV's hard disk went missing when he
sent the guard outside to buy cigarettes.

838
01:26:28,583 --> 01:26:29,845
And he doesn't smoke!

839
01:26:32,754 --> 01:26:34,585
Until you sent Narayanan
to buy cigarettes,

840
01:26:34,689 --> 01:26:35,951
the CCTV camera was connected.

841
01:26:36,157 --> 01:26:38,455
Now there's no connection,
and no hard disk as well!

842
01:26:38,693 --> 01:26:40,923
He behaved very rudely to me
when l went to his apartment.

843
01:26:40,995 --> 01:26:41,962
What?

844
01:26:43,164 --> 01:26:44,961
He had called the control room on that day.

845
01:26:45,033 --> 01:26:47,558
He must've tried to report
something related to the robbery;

846
01:26:47,635 --> 01:26:50,103
and then he must have changed
his mind for some reason.

847
01:26:51,573 --> 01:26:53,734
And ya, l had seen him in the
DCP's office recently.

848
01:26:53,808 --> 01:26:55,969
There?
- He was at the writer's cabin.

849
01:27:02,784 --> 01:27:03,751
Why did he come?

850
01:27:03,851 --> 01:27:07,889
He has collected details about POCSO
cases & the murder of Samuel Sir,

851
01:27:07,889 --> 01:27:09,754
using the right to
information act.

852
01:27:14,329 --> 01:27:16,263
He has a beautiful
daughter, right?

853
01:27:28,343 --> 01:27:29,310
Who is it?

854
01:27:29,978 --> 01:27:30,945
Andrews.

855
01:27:31,212 --> 01:27:32,236
From the police.

856
01:27:32,347 --> 01:27:33,314
CBClD.

857
01:27:35,216 --> 01:27:36,615
What's on your face, Narayanan?

858
01:27:36,718 --> 01:27:38,015
l fell down, Sir.

859
01:27:38,953 --> 01:27:40,614
Looks like someone punched you!

860
01:27:56,204 --> 01:27:57,262
What actually happened?

861
01:28:01,776 --> 01:28:02,743
l'm asking you!

862
01:28:08,883 --> 01:28:09,850
l am Andrews.

863
01:28:09,984 --> 01:28:10,951
From the police!

864
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:14,680
l was just asking
some questions to Sara.

865
01:28:16,057 --> 01:28:17,115
Go to your room.

866
01:28:18,192 --> 01:28:19,318
Sara will not go anywhere!

867
01:28:20,194 --> 01:28:21,161
She will sit there!

868
01:28:28,670 --> 01:28:29,728
You should leave from here!

869
01:28:31,806 --> 01:28:32,898
Did you see him, Sara?

870
01:28:33,875 --> 01:28:34,876
Listen,

871
01:28:34,876 --> 01:28:37,245
if you don't tell me, l will
have to take you to the station.

872
01:28:37,245 --> 01:28:38,212
Dad!

873
01:28:40,181 --> 01:28:42,877
Sara will leave only after
answering my question.

874
01:28:43,751 --> 01:28:44,718
What is this?

875
01:28:44,819 --> 01:28:45,786
Andrews Eapen.

876
01:28:46,220 --> 01:28:47,187
Crime Branch.

877
01:28:48,356 --> 01:28:49,323
Go inside.

878
01:28:49,657 --> 01:28:50,624
Come.

879
01:28:50,725 --> 01:28:51,692
Come, dear.

880
01:28:52,126 --> 01:28:54,287
How dare you barge into our
house & do such nonsense?

881
01:28:56,030 --> 01:28:57,861
See Mister..
- Colonel Ninan Francis.

882
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:03,628
l have to interrogate Sara.

883
01:29:04,806 --> 01:29:07,707
Ask your son to come to my office
with her, tomorrow morning.

884
01:29:11,779 --> 01:29:12,746
lf you're good to me,

885
01:29:13,381 --> 01:29:14,405
l'll also be good to you.

886
01:29:47,949 --> 01:29:49,211
lt was okay if you
came tomorrow.

887
01:29:50,785 --> 01:29:52,377
l'm used to being early.

888
01:29:55,356 --> 01:29:57,191
lf you could've reached
early everywhere,

889
01:29:57,191 --> 01:29:59,386
certain unfortunates things
wouldn't have happened.

890
01:30:08,469 --> 01:30:09,697
She hasn't come.

891
01:30:10,805 --> 01:30:11,772
She won't come.

892
01:30:13,074 --> 01:30:14,939
There's a law and
the police here.

893
01:30:17,912 --> 01:30:19,174
My daughter has herfather.

894
01:30:21,149 --> 01:30:22,275
The tea is really hot.

895
01:30:23,317 --> 01:30:24,485
But after some time,

896
01:30:24,485 --> 01:30:25,713
it will go cold.

897
01:30:26,087 --> 01:30:27,418
Don'tjudge me by my looks.

898
01:30:28,222 --> 01:30:29,189
l'm a cop!

899
01:30:31,893 --> 01:30:32,860
A cop, indeed.

900
01:30:32,927 --> 01:30:35,418
Who gave you the license to
attack all the perverts in town?

901
01:30:36,831 --> 01:30:37,832
Or,

902
01:30:37,832 --> 01:30:41,131
do you think that you're the King
David from the old testament,

903
01:30:41,469 --> 01:30:44,029
who saved the people from the
attacks of bears & lions?

904
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:47,467
Even if it's a bear or a lion;

905
01:30:48,242 --> 01:30:49,470
the nature has its own law.

906
01:30:50,511 --> 01:30:54,447
And there are many animals who've taken the
form of humans without understanding that.

907
01:30:54,816 --> 01:30:56,044
To enforce the law here,

908
01:30:56,984 --> 01:30:58,110
to enforce justice here,

909
01:30:59,487 --> 01:31:01,853
if this David has to assume a king's role,

910
01:31:02,457 --> 01:31:03,981
considerthat l am entitled to it.

911
01:31:04,959 --> 01:31:05,983
You can call me,

912
01:31:06,227 --> 01:31:07,194
King

913
01:31:07,462 --> 01:31:08,429
David!

914
01:31:39,393 --> 01:31:41,793
She is the only child who
survived this series of killings.

915
01:31:42,897 --> 01:31:44,194
lf we have to go forward,

916
01:31:44,565 --> 01:31:45,998
we have to get her statement.

917
01:31:46,100 --> 01:31:47,431
l won't give you a court order.

918
01:31:47,535 --> 01:31:50,834
You want to interrogate a child who
is in shock & create more problems?

919
01:31:51,239 --> 01:31:53,434
The law provides a protective
Armour to children.

920
01:31:54,075 --> 01:31:57,044
Probably, more than what's
given to legislative members.

921
01:31:57,411 --> 01:31:59,572
Don't ask me to join
you on your ego trip!

922
01:31:59,914 --> 01:32:00,915
lf you do that,

923
01:32:00,915 --> 01:32:02,473
l'll get you out of
yourjob, Andrews!

924
01:32:03,851 --> 01:32:06,479
l just thought that if it happens
in a straight way, let it happen!

925
01:32:09,257 --> 01:32:12,818
l know how to reach the kid
without losing my job.

926
01:32:13,594 --> 01:32:14,561
So Sir,

927
01:32:16,497 --> 01:32:17,987
my salute to you!

928
01:32:33,481 --> 01:32:34,880
l'm from the
maintenance section.

929
01:32:34,949 --> 01:32:36,211
l thought you left, Sir.

930
01:32:36,317 --> 01:32:37,375
Everyone else has left.

931
01:33:01,609 --> 01:33:05,306
The routes you're taking to
find me, are thrilling me!

932
01:33:44,585 --> 01:33:45,643
What's your name?

933
01:33:51,359 --> 01:33:52,656
We are here to help you.

934
01:33:55,696 --> 01:34:00,326
The sorrows, troubles and secrets which
you can't even tell your parents;

935
01:34:00,701 --> 01:34:02,032
you can say all that to us.

936
01:34:03,004 --> 01:34:04,596
You can say anything
to us, openly!

937
01:34:05,206 --> 01:34:07,265
Has anyone misbehaved
with you, Sara?

938
01:34:12,713 --> 01:34:14,305
You don't have to fear anyone.

939
01:34:14,582 --> 01:34:16,174
Whatever it is, tell us openly.

940
01:34:17,018 --> 01:34:19,987
The government has appointed us
forthe protection of children.

941
01:34:27,461 --> 01:34:29,156
Didn't you understand
what l asked you?

942
01:34:35,670 --> 01:34:36,637
Look at me!

943
01:34:40,074 --> 01:34:41,006
Don't worry!

944
01:34:41,709 --> 01:34:42,676
Tell me.

945
01:34:44,779 --> 01:34:46,371
When there was no one at home,

946
01:34:46,714 --> 01:34:47,976
did someone..

947
01:34:48,082 --> 01:34:49,049
l mean..

948
01:34:49,116 --> 01:34:51,949
did someone touch or
hold your private parts?

949
01:34:56,257 --> 01:34:57,588
Don't cry unnecessarily!

950
01:35:00,528 --> 01:35:02,086
Nothing happened to me.

951
01:35:02,463 --> 01:35:03,623
What did he do to you?

952
01:35:04,098 --> 01:35:05,156
Nothing happened to me.

953
01:35:05,266 --> 01:35:07,530
Your dad must have taught
you to say all this, right?

954
01:35:08,436 --> 01:35:11,166
You have reached the age where
you can understand all that. Tell me!

955
01:35:11,472 --> 01:35:12,632
What did he do to you?

956
01:35:13,274 --> 01:35:15,208
What all did he do?
- Stop this nonsense!

957
01:35:16,544 --> 01:35:17,568
What's going on?

958
01:35:17,645 --> 01:35:18,703
This is counselling.

959
01:35:18,813 --> 01:35:21,179
l won't allow anyone to
trouble my students!

960
01:36:10,831 --> 01:36:13,595
lf l see you even near
the shadow of my child,

961
01:36:21,509 --> 01:36:22,669
l will slice you into pieces.

962
01:36:56,877 --> 01:36:57,866
Chechi!
(Sister)

963
01:36:58,112 --> 01:36:59,306
Ya! l'm bringing it.

964
01:38:57,765 --> 01:39:00,825
These are the CCTV visuals of
that night, from 12 AM to 2 AM.

965
01:39:10,844 --> 01:39:11,811
Pause it.

966
01:39:17,418 --> 01:39:19,443
That sticker on that vehicle.
Zoom in on that.

967
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:21,387
lt can't be zoomed, Sir.

968
01:39:21,822 --> 01:39:23,687
And l have cut this portion
into a separate clip.

969
01:39:23,757 --> 01:39:25,622
Another Sir came earlier
& took it from me.

970
01:39:26,026 --> 01:39:27,789
l still have a copy of
that on the system.

971
01:39:28,295 --> 01:39:30,820
You can take it and try it in some
other software, if you want to.

972
01:39:33,667 --> 01:39:34,691
When did that Sir come?

973
01:39:34,935 --> 01:39:35,993
That was really early.

974
01:39:36,870 --> 01:39:37,837
That's true.

975
01:39:37,972 --> 01:39:39,405
That Sir is never late.

976
01:39:42,576 --> 01:39:43,804
Look, it's him!

977
01:40:13,874 --> 01:40:15,075
l want to meet Dr.Susan.

978
01:40:15,075 --> 01:40:16,372
She is on the first floor.

979
01:40:18,612 --> 01:40:20,944
Under the 'Protection of Children
from Sexual Offense act;

980
01:40:21,415 --> 01:40:24,509
what you're doing is a crime that can send
you to jail without bail for 5 years.

981
01:40:25,119 --> 01:40:26,381
Are you threatening me?

982
01:40:26,754 --> 01:40:27,778
lf you think so!

983
01:40:28,088 --> 01:40:30,056
You're avoiding the justice
that a child deserves.

984
01:40:30,591 --> 01:40:32,889
A bigger cruelty
than what she lost.

985
01:40:33,927 --> 01:40:35,053
What did she lose?

986
01:40:36,430 --> 01:40:37,765
All of you have this assumption,

987
01:40:37,765 --> 01:40:41,531
that a woman is a being with something
precious to lose between her belly & thighs.

988
01:40:42,102 --> 01:40:45,094
lf something happens to a woman, you
don't even consider her as a human.

989
01:40:45,439 --> 01:40:46,929
Sympathy, disdain, denial.

990
01:40:47,474 --> 01:40:48,805
And a farce called
investigation.

991
01:40:49,043 --> 01:40:50,305
Everything is celebrated!

992
01:40:53,680 --> 01:40:55,944
So you're not willing
to co-operate?

993
01:40:56,450 --> 01:40:57,417
Definitely not!

994
01:40:58,485 --> 01:40:59,452
Loss, it seems!

995
01:41:01,021 --> 01:41:02,921
lf your interrogation
is over, please leave.

996
01:41:03,023 --> 01:41:03,990
l have work to do.

997
01:41:10,764 --> 01:41:12,732
'Foreign Liquor Store'

998
01:41:24,178 --> 01:41:25,145
Move!

999
01:41:25,612 --> 01:41:26,977
What are you doing?

1000
01:41:27,114 --> 01:41:29,742
What?
- We're also here to buy this stuff.

1001
01:41:29,850 --> 01:41:31,518
Go stand at the back!
- No!

1002
01:41:31,518 --> 01:41:32,644
How is that fair?

1003
01:41:32,853 --> 01:41:33,987
Go back!

1004
01:41:33,987 --> 01:41:34,954
Get lost!

1005
01:41:35,022 --> 01:41:36,590
lf you have a
problem, file a case!

1006
01:41:36,590 --> 01:41:37,784
You're trying to show off?

1007
01:41:37,891 --> 01:41:39,993
No! l'm planning to show much more!
What will you do?

1008
01:41:39,993 --> 01:41:42,086
Hey fatso! You don't know me!
Get out of here!

1009
01:41:42,162 --> 01:41:43,163
Get lost!

1010
01:41:43,163 --> 01:41:44,630
This isn't fair, Sir.

1011
01:41:44,832 --> 01:41:46,561
Didn't l ask you to file a case?

1012
01:41:46,767 --> 01:41:48,701
You're lucky that l don't
have my tools with me.

1013
01:41:48,769 --> 01:41:49,770
What?

1014
01:41:49,770 --> 01:41:52,068
After the bars shut down, these
noblemen have shifted here.

1015
01:41:52,139 --> 01:41:53,140
Losers!

1016
01:41:53,140 --> 01:41:55,631
Notjust losers. They're..
- They won't stand in the queue.

1017
01:42:21,001 --> 01:42:23,834
'Even l don't know
how l am right now'

1018
01:42:24,905 --> 01:42:26,497
That has many meanings.

1019
01:42:28,742 --> 01:42:29,766
That's his name.

1020
01:42:31,578 --> 01:42:33,409
He is beating up all
the perverts in town.

1021
01:42:33,514 --> 01:42:35,175
That's how you also got
beaten, Anto Chettan.

1022
01:42:39,186 --> 01:42:41,622
He is on a rampage,
in a black car.

1023
01:42:41,622 --> 01:42:43,647
When he is with his
daughter in a white car,

1024
01:42:43,724 --> 01:42:44,691
he is normal.

1025
01:43:02,109 --> 01:43:03,277
His daughter is coming.

1026
01:43:03,277 --> 01:43:05,074
Should we do this in
front of school-kids?

1027
01:43:23,163 --> 01:43:24,130
Anto Chettan,

1028
01:43:24,198 --> 01:43:25,165
he got down.

1029
01:43:44,851 --> 01:43:46,019
Chikku, Shoby, get down!

1030
01:43:46,019 --> 01:43:47,247
Show him who Anto is!

1031
01:43:47,888 --> 01:43:49,287
Come fast!
- Hurry up!

1032
01:43:49,556 --> 01:43:50,545
Get the knife!

1033
01:43:50,624 --> 01:43:51,852
Don't push.
Get down fast!

1034
01:44:20,320 --> 01:44:22,083
- Dude, he has a gun!
- A gun!

1035
01:44:29,329 --> 01:44:31,854
He has a gun even when he's
in the white car! Let's escape!

1036
01:44:42,209 --> 01:44:45,667
Our people have seen guns only
in Amal Neerad's films, right?

1037
01:44:46,313 --> 01:44:47,575
Leave it, Anto.

1038
01:44:47,881 --> 01:44:48,848
Let's go!

1039
01:44:49,016 --> 01:44:50,108
He has a gun even now?

1040
01:45:41,168 --> 01:45:43,193
Hey! Ask your mom to
make some tea for me.

1041
01:45:45,072 --> 01:45:46,096
Which loser is this?

1042
01:45:46,306 --> 01:45:47,273
Your prey!

1043
01:45:47,374 --> 01:45:48,773
The prey who's a hunter!

1044
01:45:49,242 --> 01:45:51,210
l knew you'd call me, you @@$@$!

1045
01:45:51,712 --> 01:45:53,009
Then tell me, Andrews.

1046
01:45:53,313 --> 01:45:54,746
Why have l called you?

1047
01:45:55,215 --> 01:45:56,182
Hold on.

1048
01:45:57,050 --> 01:45:58,278
Where's my tea?

1049
01:46:05,826 --> 01:46:06,884
Ya! Tell me, dear.

1050
01:46:11,665 --> 01:46:12,632
You tell me.

1051
01:46:13,233 --> 01:46:14,996
You're going to
kill another child.

1052
01:46:15,202 --> 01:46:16,328
You want to inform that to me,

1053
01:46:16,803 --> 01:46:18,134
and tease me as well.

1054
01:46:26,380 --> 01:46:27,347
Get lost, man!

1055
01:46:27,814 --> 01:46:29,281
Why should l listen to you?

1056
01:46:29,916 --> 01:46:32,077
l heard all the nonsense
you spoke to Sam.

1057
01:46:32,252 --> 01:46:33,947
Where are the targets
of your challenge?

1058
01:46:34,755 --> 01:46:35,915
Hang up, you loser!

1059
01:46:49,469 --> 01:46:51,037
After he called you,

1060
01:46:51,037 --> 01:46:52,971
he changed the sim card
& made 2 more calls.

1061
01:46:53,073 --> 01:46:55,439
Even though he changed the sim,
he used the same mobile set.

1062
01:46:56,009 --> 01:46:58,910
He made those 2 calls from
the same lMEl number.

1063
01:46:59,346 --> 01:47:00,973
One was to that builder, David.

1064
01:47:05,485 --> 01:47:06,918
When we tracked the lMEl,

1065
01:47:07,053 --> 01:47:08,884
those three calls had three
different numbers.

1066
01:47:09,022 --> 01:47:10,421
But the handset was the same.

1067
01:47:10,924 --> 01:47:12,289
His first mistake.

1068
01:47:13,326 --> 01:47:15,453
The third call was to this guy -
Sathyanath.

1069
01:47:17,831 --> 01:47:19,196
Why should the killer call him?

1070
01:47:20,834 --> 01:47:22,324
Now, there's a market
for child abuse.

1071
01:47:23,003 --> 01:47:23,970
He needs that.

1072
01:47:24,838 --> 01:47:25,805
And the killer,

1073
01:47:26,907 --> 01:47:28,204
wants some publicity as well!

1074
01:47:36,550 --> 01:47:37,517
Police, right?

1075
01:47:37,918 --> 01:47:38,885
l know.

1076
01:47:39,853 --> 01:47:41,184
Why is he calling you,

1077
01:47:41,321 --> 01:47:42,288
Sathyanath?

1078
01:47:42,556 --> 01:47:43,557
Who?

1079
01:47:43,557 --> 01:47:44,524
When?

1080
01:47:46,426 --> 01:47:48,986
lf you want me to say it officially
with latitude & longitude,

1081
01:47:49,062 --> 01:47:50,495
7 days back, on Monday.

1082
01:47:50,564 --> 01:47:53,033
ln front of your
regular liquor store.

1083
01:47:53,033 --> 01:47:54,500
The call that came
at 3.05 PM sharp!

1084
01:47:55,235 --> 01:47:56,202
Whose was it?

1085
01:47:57,437 --> 01:47:59,496
You're quite good, man!
You found it out!

1086
01:48:00,106 --> 01:48:01,801
But l'm not going to tell you!

1087
01:48:02,175 --> 01:48:04,211
Consider it as the
arrogance of ajournalist.

1088
01:48:04,211 --> 01:48:05,178
And,

1089
01:48:05,579 --> 01:48:07,877
with your over-confidence
of being an undercover cop,

1090
01:48:08,081 --> 01:48:09,878
and these solid muscles,

1091
01:48:10,317 --> 01:48:12,410
if you're trying to
scare this Sathyanathan,

1092
01:48:13,887 --> 01:48:16,412
l'll try to be scared when l step
out to take a leak in the night.

1093
01:48:24,197 --> 01:48:25,221
So carry on, Sir.

1094
01:48:28,335 --> 01:48:29,461
Got it, you kiddo?

1095
01:48:30,537 --> 01:48:32,232
Don't play in the swamp,

1096
01:48:32,572 --> 01:48:33,800
you will be soiled!

1097
01:48:48,922 --> 01:48:50,913
Assign the surveillance
of this place to someone.

1098
01:48:51,024 --> 01:48:53,822
He has to be beaten up in the dark
without using the department's name.

1099
01:49:11,244 --> 01:49:13,269
You nutcase,
what do you want?

1100
01:49:13,346 --> 01:49:14,313
Tell me!

1101
01:49:15,515 --> 01:49:17,983
Mine isn't any ordinary daily
that prints 1000-2000 copies.

1102
01:49:18,652 --> 01:49:19,880
Tell me, you scoundrel!

1103
01:49:20,153 --> 01:49:22,417
What do you want?
Why have you tied me up?

1104
01:49:24,958 --> 01:49:25,925
No questions.

1105
01:49:26,927 --> 01:49:27,928
Just tell me.

1106
01:49:27,928 --> 01:49:29,589
You've been going
on for a while now!

1107
01:49:30,130 --> 01:49:32,257
You rascal, l will
destroy yourfamily!

1108
01:49:35,468 --> 01:49:36,935
l'm warning you!

1109
01:49:37,103 --> 01:49:38,070
Untie me!

1110
01:49:38,204 --> 01:49:40,297
You will face the consequences,
l'm telling you!

1111
01:49:42,342 --> 01:49:43,468
You will cry, man!

1112
01:49:44,277 --> 01:49:46,142
You will cry for your dear ones!

1113
01:49:46,446 --> 01:49:47,913
lf not, l'll make you cry!

1114
01:49:48,949 --> 01:49:50,246
l'm not bluffing!

1115
01:49:50,483 --> 01:49:52,348
As long as l can hold
a pen in my hand,

1116
01:49:52,485 --> 01:49:53,952
with my 'S's and 'F's,

1117
01:49:54,020 --> 01:49:55,885
l will finish your family!

1118
01:49:55,989 --> 01:49:57,354
Then you'll know who l am!

1119
01:49:59,659 --> 01:50:00,956
You're messing with..

1120
01:50:06,967 --> 01:50:07,934
Oh God!

1121
01:50:08,468 --> 01:50:09,662
Oh my God!
What is this?

1122
01:50:11,972 --> 01:50:13,166
What are you doing?

1123
01:50:13,607 --> 01:50:15,507
Are you going to kill me?
Oh my God!

1124
01:50:15,942 --> 01:50:17,000
l wasn't serious!

1125
01:50:17,077 --> 01:50:18,044
l was bluffing!

1126
01:50:18,111 --> 01:50:19,169
Don't hurt me!

1127
01:50:19,245 --> 01:50:20,177
Oh God!

1128
01:50:24,217 --> 01:50:25,309
Let me go.

1129
01:50:25,385 --> 01:50:26,352
Untie me!

1130
01:50:28,021 --> 01:50:28,988
No!

1131
01:50:30,690 --> 01:50:31,657
l'll tell you.

1132
01:50:32,058 --> 01:50:33,650
- l'll tell you.
- Then tell me.

1133
01:50:34,694 --> 01:50:35,661
l swear!

1134
01:50:36,196 --> 01:50:37,629
l don't know who he is!

1135
01:50:40,266 --> 01:50:42,257
He called me to say that l
should write about him.

1136
01:50:43,370 --> 01:50:45,930
He doesn't give any detail
that can help me identify him.

1137
01:50:46,940 --> 01:50:48,464
He told me that l
should write about him,

1138
01:50:49,409 --> 01:50:51,400
and that the police are
hiding everything.

1139
01:50:52,245 --> 01:50:54,076
He wants everyone
to talk about him.

1140
01:50:54,514 --> 01:50:55,981
Everyone should be scared of him.

1141
01:50:56,216 --> 01:50:57,911
Those were his needs.

1142
01:50:59,185 --> 01:51:00,914
lnitially, l didn't believe any of it.

1143
01:51:02,188 --> 01:51:05,680
But one day, he gave me the details
of his next murder in advance.

1144
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:08,689
l believed him, only
after it happened.

1145
01:51:10,196 --> 01:51:11,959
Since it was beneficial
for me as well,

1146
01:51:12,499 --> 01:51:13,557
l followed it up.

1147
01:51:17,704 --> 01:51:19,695
He called me and
gave me information.

1148
01:51:21,074 --> 01:51:23,565
That's how l got the
details of your daughter.

1149
01:51:31,785 --> 01:51:35,221
He was ashamed of the fact
that your child survived.

1150
01:51:36,289 --> 01:51:37,256
So,

1151
01:51:38,725 --> 01:51:40,386
He said that he will kill her.

1152
01:51:43,263 --> 01:51:44,594
To know who he is,

1153
01:51:45,365 --> 01:51:46,662
l followed the child.

1154
01:51:50,570 --> 01:51:53,596
l knew that he would come looking
for the kid some day orthe other.

1155
01:51:54,574 --> 01:51:55,541
But,

1156
01:51:55,775 --> 01:51:57,675
one day the police came here,

1157
01:51:58,278 --> 01:51:59,404
tracking his call.

1158
01:52:00,113 --> 01:52:02,411
Why does he call
you, Sathyanath?

1159
01:52:03,550 --> 01:52:05,609
Since there were chances of
being caught after that,

1160
01:52:06,553 --> 01:52:08,783
l told him not to talk
to me over the phone.

1161
01:52:09,222 --> 01:52:10,189
One day,

1162
01:52:25,572 --> 01:52:27,039
lt was a pen drive.

1163
01:52:28,475 --> 01:52:30,238
His voice was recorded in that.

1164
01:52:31,044 --> 01:52:34,343
He had recorded the facts that
were necessary for my story.

1165
01:52:38,351 --> 01:52:41,149
There were details of his
rapes & murders in it.

1166
01:52:53,299 --> 01:52:56,359
But there was nothing in it
which could identify him.

1167
01:52:57,570 --> 01:53:00,061
He wants to be presented to
the society as an anti-hero.

1168
01:53:00,473 --> 01:53:02,168
That was his demand.

1169
01:53:02,842 --> 01:53:03,809
Why you?

1170
01:53:05,311 --> 01:53:06,676
Why did he choose you?

1171
01:53:08,882 --> 01:53:09,849
He said,

1172
01:53:11,417 --> 01:53:14,079
that he wanted the
filthiest journalist.

1173
01:53:16,189 --> 01:53:17,383
That pen drive is over there.

1174
01:53:17,891 --> 01:53:19,153
Don't hurt me!

1175
01:53:19,225 --> 01:53:20,560
l told you everything!
Please!

1176
01:53:20,560 --> 01:53:22,391
Oh God!
Untie me!

1177
01:53:23,096 --> 01:53:24,393
Whatever l said is true!

1178
01:53:24,798 --> 01:53:26,595
The market is for rape news now.

1179
01:53:27,367 --> 01:53:28,629
Especially, that of children.

1180
01:53:29,235 --> 01:53:30,793
That.. That's why l...

1181
01:53:30,870 --> 01:53:32,138
Oh God!

1182
01:53:32,138 --> 01:53:33,332
Don't do anything to me!

1183
01:53:33,907 --> 01:53:35,272
You shouldn't write, ever again!

1184
01:53:36,576 --> 01:53:38,703
You shouldn't even
think about writing.

1185
01:53:40,413 --> 01:53:41,778
Oh God!
No!

1186
01:53:42,148 --> 01:53:43,115
No!

1187
01:53:43,216 --> 01:53:44,183
Don't do it!

1188
01:53:46,886 --> 01:53:47,853
- Don't go!

1189
01:54:21,487 --> 01:54:22,749
Sir, David just left from here.

1190
01:54:23,723 --> 01:54:25,452
l heard some noise from
upstairs, as well.

1191
01:54:25,758 --> 01:54:26,725
And ya,

1192
01:54:26,826 --> 01:54:27,884
unlike what l said,

1193
01:54:28,228 --> 01:54:29,718
he smokes stylishly!

1194
01:54:29,796 --> 01:54:31,431
What the hell were you looking at?

1195
01:54:31,431 --> 01:54:32,455
Go see if he's alive!

1196
01:54:37,704 --> 01:54:38,671
What?

1197
01:54:38,938 --> 01:54:39,905
What happened?

1198
01:54:40,306 --> 01:54:41,705
A small bomb exploded!

1199
01:54:42,308 --> 01:54:45,209
Take me to the hospital quickly!

1200
01:54:52,252 --> 01:54:53,219
David!

1201
01:54:53,953 --> 01:54:56,217
l come home early these days.

1202
01:54:56,289 --> 01:54:59,281
l thought l'll be a little more
responsible about my parents.

1203
01:55:00,226 --> 01:55:01,284
ls it a pen drive?

1204
01:55:02,729 --> 01:55:04,219
lt's an antique piece!

1205
01:55:04,530 --> 01:55:05,929
You would've used
it a lot, right?

1206
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,400
Why don't you throw
away such old stuff?.

1207
01:55:09,836 --> 01:55:10,803
4 GB.

1208
01:55:11,337 --> 01:55:12,804
lt can't even store 2 films!

1209
01:55:16,843 --> 01:55:18,811
Buy a new hard disk!
l'll throw this away.

1210
01:55:19,712 --> 01:55:21,407
lf you don't give it
back, l'll kill you!

1211
01:55:22,315 --> 01:55:23,282
Give it.

1212
01:56:38,691 --> 01:56:41,558
lt was when that fraud
guard Narayanan went out,

1213
01:56:41,961 --> 01:56:43,690
that our apartment was robbed.

1214
01:56:45,732 --> 01:56:47,996
Prakash is my brother-in-law, Sir.

1215
01:56:50,336 --> 01:56:53,072
While l was running out of Johnny
Sir's flat with whatever l got,

1216
01:56:53,072 --> 01:56:54,369
l saw a man with a mask.

1217
01:56:54,540 --> 01:56:55,564
Ajoker's mask.

1218
01:56:57,110 --> 01:56:58,338
Ajoker's mask!

1219
01:57:00,079 --> 01:57:02,582
He wants to be presented before
the society as an anti-hero.

1220
01:57:02,582 --> 01:57:04,049
That was his demand.

1221
01:57:25,772 --> 01:57:26,932
William is in the US.

1222
01:57:27,974 --> 01:57:30,374
Who took this
connection in his name?

1223
01:57:30,743 --> 01:57:33,780
Even the police told me that prank calls
were being made from this number.

1224
01:57:33,780 --> 01:57:37,443
Have you given any identity cards
or photos to anyone recently?

1225
01:57:37,750 --> 01:57:38,808
Didn't l tell you already?

1226
01:57:38,918 --> 01:57:39,885
No!

1227
01:57:55,134 --> 01:57:56,101
This?

1228
01:57:58,371 --> 01:58:00,430
That's a new apartment that
William is going to buy.

1229
01:58:00,773 --> 01:58:02,138
From Venture Builders in Kochi.

1230
01:58:03,976 --> 01:58:05,534
l had given some
documents to them.

1231
01:58:05,678 --> 01:58:07,578
For the purpose of loans
and otherformalities.

1232
01:58:09,615 --> 01:58:10,946
This is to inform you that

1233
01:58:11,417 --> 01:58:12,941
you have been terminated
from this firm.

1234
01:58:13,419 --> 01:58:15,785
For negligence and misuse
of company properties.

1235
01:58:15,888 --> 01:58:19,756
Henceforth, the management has decided
to terminate you with immediate effect.

1236
01:58:20,193 --> 01:58:24,391
You are requested to return all the
company assets in your possession.

1237
01:58:27,133 --> 01:58:28,532
Before leaving.

1238
01:58:41,848 --> 01:58:42,906
A few days back,

1239
01:58:43,683 --> 01:58:45,844
someone who introduced
himself as a joker,

1240
01:58:46,452 --> 01:58:47,510
spoke to me on the phone.

1241
01:58:49,188 --> 01:58:51,850
When l investigated in the
curiosity to find out who he is,

1242
01:58:54,694 --> 01:58:55,661
William Chacko.

1243
01:58:55,795 --> 01:58:57,820
He is a client of our Green
Cliff Villa Project.

1244
01:58:58,431 --> 01:58:59,955
When l checked his file,

1245
01:59:00,166 --> 01:59:02,828
many documents that he had submitted
to the company are missing.

1246
01:59:03,603 --> 01:59:06,538
The number that called me was
bought using those documents.

1247
01:59:07,473 --> 01:59:08,531
Upon further investigation,

1248
01:59:08,875 --> 01:59:11,844
l found that many of our
clients' documents are missing.

1249
01:59:14,614 --> 01:59:17,174
Those documents might be talking
to many people right now.

1250
01:59:19,719 --> 01:59:21,744
Since you are the ones
who had handled those files,

1251
01:59:22,455 --> 01:59:23,789
l have summoned you here.

1252
01:59:23,789 --> 01:59:24,847
lf that's the case,

1253
01:59:24,957 --> 01:59:26,515
it needs to be
considered seriously.

1254
01:59:27,894 --> 01:59:30,226
The facilities of our
office are being misused.

1255
01:59:30,463 --> 01:59:31,862
We have to find him, whoever it is.

1256
01:59:32,732 --> 01:59:33,994
We have to find him!

1257
01:59:34,634 --> 01:59:35,692
We must find him!

1258
01:59:37,136 --> 01:59:39,661
l am scrutinizing everything
and everyone now.

1259
02:00:01,060 --> 02:00:04,086
These gloves are the kind which are
used by workers in construction sites.

1260
02:00:05,198 --> 02:00:07,928
There were particles of
cement and sand on this.

1261
02:00:11,504 --> 02:00:15,031
The sticker on the vehicle which was
captured by the jewellery's CCTV, is a logo.

1262
02:00:15,942 --> 02:00:18,843
The logo of that builder
David's Venture Builders.

1263
02:00:47,139 --> 02:00:48,106
So,

1264
02:00:48,307 --> 02:00:51,572
both of us are looking for
someone who's right here.

1265
02:00:56,549 --> 02:00:57,743
Poor you!

1266
02:00:58,184 --> 02:01:00,516
Someone who's working for you
did this to your child..

1267
02:01:02,021 --> 02:01:03,147
Now you can take rest.

1268
02:01:03,222 --> 02:01:05,690
Within some time,
we will catch him.

1269
02:01:06,692 --> 02:01:07,659
l told you.

1270
02:01:07,927 --> 02:01:09,622
l won't let you
get to him first.

1271
02:01:11,564 --> 02:01:12,724
After l take him into custody,

1272
02:01:13,332 --> 02:01:14,697
l'll come with him;

1273
02:01:15,001 --> 02:01:16,525
to meet your dear daughter.

1274
02:01:17,069 --> 02:01:18,036
To get her statement.

1275
02:01:18,904 --> 02:01:21,668
l want to see how you're
going to protect her then.

1276
02:01:22,041 --> 02:01:23,008
Get out!

1277
02:01:24,977 --> 02:01:26,001
l told you decently,

1278
02:01:26,212 --> 02:01:28,112
lf you're good to me,
l'll be good to you.

1279
02:01:28,314 --> 02:01:30,111
You & your parallel
investigation!

1280
02:01:32,985 --> 02:01:35,146
Even after you tortured
my child so much,

1281
02:01:35,988 --> 02:01:37,819
do you know why
l'm neglecting you?

1282
02:01:38,791 --> 02:01:40,349
lf l start taking you
into consideration,

1283
02:01:40,826 --> 02:01:42,760
it means that it's the
end of your life!

1284
02:01:47,833 --> 02:01:48,891
He is here.

1285
02:02:03,382 --> 02:02:04,383
lt's him, Sir.

1286
02:02:04,383 --> 02:02:05,718
We got this from his bag.

1287
02:02:05,718 --> 02:02:06,980
Photos of school kids,

1288
02:02:07,620 --> 02:02:08,780
and the gloves of the killer.

1289
02:02:33,112 --> 02:02:34,079
Tell me!

1290
02:06:26,979 --> 02:06:28,310
What's that in your hand?

1291
02:06:29,982 --> 02:06:31,142
An uncle gave this to me.

1292
02:06:31,250 --> 02:06:32,410
Near the gate.

1293
02:07:24,203 --> 02:07:25,170
Stop!

1294
02:08:15,387 --> 02:08:16,945
This table is all dusty.

1295
02:08:19,725 --> 02:08:21,215
She was drawing
something over here.

1296
02:08:22,361 --> 02:08:23,658
This is the dust
from the eraser.

1297
02:09:07,372 --> 02:09:08,600
Let me see yourface, please.

1298
02:09:09,808 --> 02:09:11,400
l have seen many serials.

1299
02:09:11,543 --> 02:09:13,636
But l'm seeing a serial
killer for the first time!

1300
02:09:18,183 --> 02:09:19,343
You haven't let him go yet?

1301
02:09:19,518 --> 02:09:21,213
Without even using a feather,

1302
02:09:21,286 --> 02:09:22,654
l made him admit to
everything, Sir.

1303
02:09:22,654 --> 02:09:23,621
Send him away!

1304
02:09:23,689 --> 02:09:24,781
You & your feather!

1305
02:09:26,825 --> 02:09:28,793
The body we found from
David's office lift,

1306
02:09:29,061 --> 02:09:32,758
is that of 12 year old Jancy Joseph who
went missing from Thrisshur a week back.

1307
02:09:33,665 --> 02:09:36,293
According to reports, another
child is still in his custody.

1308
02:09:37,169 --> 02:09:40,332
The peon from David's office
gave me a package to give you.

1309
02:09:50,649 --> 02:09:52,048
lf you're smart enough,

1310
02:09:52,518 --> 02:09:53,644
let it be of use to you.

1311
02:09:54,686 --> 02:09:56,449
lt belongs to you as well.

1312
02:09:57,523 --> 02:09:58,854
What's going to be enforced,

1313
02:09:59,792 --> 02:10:01,657
is not the law of the
country or of God,

1314
02:10:03,562 --> 02:10:04,859
it is a father's law!

1315
02:10:39,431 --> 02:10:41,296
Some girl is tied on to a chair.

1316
02:10:42,935 --> 02:10:45,130
A digital photo is also a file.

1317
02:10:46,138 --> 02:10:48,766
lt precisely records when
and where it was clicked.

1318
02:10:49,241 --> 02:10:50,742
On handsets that
have camera GPS,

1319
02:10:50,742 --> 02:10:53,905
the latitude & longitude of the place
where it was clicked are also recorded.

1320
02:10:54,413 --> 02:10:57,405
So we can find the place where a
photo was clicked, very easily.

1321
02:10:58,317 --> 02:10:59,284
Oh!

1322
02:10:59,551 --> 02:11:01,610
You took so much time, even
though it was so easy?

1323
02:11:02,154 --> 02:11:03,121
Jose!

1324
02:11:16,702 --> 02:11:18,761
Sam, who was investigating
the murders in the city;

1325
02:11:19,304 --> 02:11:20,828
was murdered at the high range.

1326
02:11:21,440 --> 02:11:22,771
Sam had identified

1327
02:11:23,242 --> 02:11:24,266
his hiding place.

1328
02:11:25,477 --> 02:11:28,674
David is also taking
the route Sam took.

1329
02:11:38,557 --> 02:11:40,718
Shahul, a friend of mine; David Ninan,

1330
02:11:40,792 --> 02:11:42,191
he is coming to your circle.

1331
02:11:42,928 --> 02:11:45,453
Until l cross him, he
shouldn't go up the hill.

1332
02:11:45,831 --> 02:11:46,889
That's because..

1333
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:23,297
Hey David!

1334
02:12:23,568 --> 02:12:25,297
l heard you're doing
the Police's job now?

1335
02:12:26,338 --> 02:12:27,498
That's not needed!

1336
02:12:27,606 --> 02:12:28,800
lt's not like earlier,

1337
02:12:29,241 --> 02:12:30,674
there are young
boys in the police.

1338
02:12:30,876 --> 02:12:33,003
So, you better go
back to your family!

1339
02:12:33,578 --> 02:12:37,207
And don't try to run into the
trap of that murderous psycho!

1340
02:12:37,983 --> 02:12:39,280
We'll take care of him!

1341
02:14:03,735 --> 02:14:06,829
'Notjust bikes.
My Papa does stunts with cars too!'

1342
02:14:11,977 --> 02:14:14,537
Start the cars!
Block him!

1343
02:14:43,942 --> 02:14:46,410
Seeing him go, l don't think
we can catch up with him, Sir.

1344
02:20:38,062 --> 02:20:39,222
You have failed!

1345
02:20:43,935 --> 02:20:45,869
You were my best opponent!

1346
02:20:53,912 --> 02:20:58,178
lt is during his last moments, that a man
proves whether he is brave or cowardly!

1347
02:20:59,984 --> 02:21:01,178
Forthat, this is better!

1348
02:21:05,523 --> 02:21:07,047
David, don't you want to know

1349
02:21:08,092 --> 02:21:09,150
who l am?

1350
02:21:11,229 --> 02:21:12,196
No, David!

1351
02:21:12,831 --> 02:21:13,798
l want to win!

1352
02:21:14,466 --> 02:21:15,433
l must win!

1353
02:21:33,485 --> 02:21:36,477
When you're narrating
your bravado before me,

1354
02:21:37,422 --> 02:21:38,411
you have failed!

1355
02:26:32,250 --> 02:26:34,684
That cancer you told me about,
l destroyed it yesterday.

1356
02:26:44,862 --> 02:26:46,830
Someone dear to us
didn't reach home yesterday.

1357
02:26:48,699 --> 02:26:49,666
Who was it?

1358
02:26:55,640 --> 02:26:58,507
Only one amongst us had the ability
to transform into another person.

1359
02:27:22,567 --> 02:27:24,296
l don't want to see you, James!

1360
02:27:25,870 --> 02:27:27,132
l don't want to see you!

1361
02:27:30,908 --> 02:27:32,500
You will know who it is, gradually.

1362
02:27:33,144 --> 02:27:34,111
But..

1363
02:27:34,545 --> 02:27:36,877
People like him don't
have a face or a form.

1364
02:27:39,650 --> 02:27:44,212
Wearing masks of caring and protection
for the family and society,

1365
02:27:44,722 --> 02:27:46,383
they would still be around us.

1366
02:27:46,724 --> 02:27:49,716
We should always have a
watchful eye over our children.

1367
02:27:54,332 --> 02:27:56,493
Only if you are
sure about winning,

1368
02:27:57,835 --> 02:27:59,496
come to my house with handcuffs.

1369
02:28:01,739 --> 02:28:02,933
You're the one who should win.

1370
02:28:03,908 --> 02:28:05,899
Nothing has happened to
our child or us.

1371
02:28:06,878 --> 02:28:09,210
Even l came here making
up my mind to finish him.

1372
02:28:09,714 --> 02:28:11,614
Or else, he'll bloat up in jail,

1373
02:28:11,849 --> 02:28:13,282
and smile at us!

1374
02:28:14,552 --> 02:28:16,611
When she is matured enough,
let her decide.

1375
02:28:16,821 --> 02:28:19,346
Whether she wants to tell the
world what happened, or not.

1376
02:28:24,595 --> 02:28:25,562
Even in my house,

1377
02:28:25,930 --> 02:28:27,591
there is a girl child
like all of them.

1378
02:29:59,657 --> 02:30:07,928
'Like shining stars in the sky'

1379
02:30:09,333 --> 02:30:18,708
'A golden star which glows on the earth'

1380
02:30:18,909 --> 02:30:26,645
'Today, my world is beside you'

1381
02:30:28,319 --> 02:30:36,556
'You are my own, my very own'

1382
02:30:37,962 --> 02:30:46,392
'You are like my shadow'

1383
02:30:47,671 --> 02:30:56,443
'With your undying love'

1384
02:30:57,348 --> 02:31:06,780
'You are my shade always'

1385
02:31:06,857 --> 02:31:14,764
'You are my life'
