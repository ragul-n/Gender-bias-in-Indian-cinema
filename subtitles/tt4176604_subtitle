But an individual, who enriched,

6
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:59,168
malayalees life, through his Karma.

7
00:01:59,532 --> 00:02:02,468
Among six such persons, the one ...

Greetings Mr. Venugopal!

11
00:02:32,132 --> 00:02:35,268
lt is notthe sameVenu,
whom people knewforyean,

12
00:02:35,499 --> 00:02:36,566
who is seated before me...

13
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:39,300
But today's Venugopal has
reached great heights...

14
00:02:39,766 --> 00:02:43,402
as a human being as well as a
businessman simultaneously!

15
00:02:44,299 --> 00:02:45,400
We would liketo hearVenu's stoy,

16
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,467
from Venu himself...

17
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,167
..Right from the Horse's mouth!

18
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:55,133
When looking back...

19
00:02:55,733 --> 00:02:57,201
Life itselfis a stoy!

20
00:02:59,132 --> 00:03:01,000
That stoy began from this house only.

21
00:03:01,733 --> 00:03:04,702
But at thattime...

22
00:03:05,265 --> 00:03:06,499
this housewas not likethis.

23
00:05:11,799 --> 00:05:14,134
l already advised you,
not to entrust this to Venu.

24
00:05:14,332 --> 00:05:16,200
Don't wory, Venu must've arnnged it.

25
00:05:16,432 --> 00:05:17,699
Swamy will reach on time.

26
00:05:19,632 --> 00:05:21,200
-Oh my God!!! Dog...!!
-Close it quickly.

27
00:05:21,466 --> 00:05:22,066

Bringing up dog to kill people?!

34
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:37,099
Where's _andhini?

35
00:05:37,599 --> 00:05:38,733
Just returned from Beauty parlour!

36
00:05:40,332 --> 00:05:42,200
Almost reached Aishwaya Rai's mom's age...!

37
00:05:42,432 --> 00:05:44,033
_othing short in her arrogance!!

38
00:05:48,332 --> 00:05:50,300
Get inside. Why standing there itself?

39
00:05:54,432 --> 00:05:56,233
Jimmy, doesn't bite, come inside.

40
00:05:56,766 --> 00:05:58,634
Why are you letting the
dog out in the day time?

41
00:05:59,065 --> 00:06:00,399
lf anybody opens the
gate unaware of it..?

42
00:06:00,599 --> 00:06:01,566
The moment Venuettan and son leaves,

43
00:06:01,799 --> 00:06:02,699
l lock the gatefrom inside.

44
00:06:03,099 --> 00:06:05,568
Nherwise people will hound me
pressing the bell.

45
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:08,133
Which beautyparlour do you go?

46
00:06:13,299 --> 00:06:14,066

00:06:19,733 --> 00:06:21,534
lsn_ this beauty enough?

50
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:23,066

Come again?

52
00:06:25,032 --> 00:06:25,732
_o, l mean.....where's Venu?

53
00:06:26,332 --> 00:06:28,133
Omana is in tension whether
Samy will come or not!

54
00:06:28,566 --> 00:06:30,134
lfVenuettan says,
how can Samyettan not come!

55
00:06:30,332 --> 00:06:33,034

That'll be there as her
delivey date is nearing.

70
00:07:04,733 --> 00:07:06,434
She mooed throughout the night,

71
00:07:06,599 --> 00:07:08,200
thus disturbing my sleep!

72
00:07:08,432 --> 00:07:09,599
Should the medicinal dose be increased?

73
00:07:10,132 --> 00:07:10,999
_ot required!

74
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,634

Orange is better as Rambutan
isn't good forthis climate.

You should've reminded Swamy!

134
00:09:17,165 --> 00:09:18,533
l deliberately didn't!

135
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:20,267
Her hoity-toity strides...

00:09:20,632 --> 00:09:21,733
and a Swimming Champion daughter!!

137
00:09:22,232 --> 00:09:24,033
Couldn't she focus properly
on pursuing MBBS?

138
00:09:24,265 --> 00:09:25,666
Any need of Swimming?
It's herAmogance!!!

139
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:27,733
Swamy needn_ give awaythe

Why didyou promise herthen?

141
00:09:29,733 --> 00:09:32,368
She'll spread rumours eveywhere
that you don't know Swamy.

Doctor?
This Defiant?!

145
00:09:43,199 --> 00:09:44,166
She's not a Doctor.

146
00:09:44,499 --> 00:09:45,566
But you called her Doctor?

147
00:09:46,032 --> 00:09:48,000
Her husband is a Doctorin Gulf.

148
00:09:48,199 --> 00:09:49,500
J
Omana is Doctor's wife

149
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:51,467

156
00:10:03,566 --> 00:10:04,433
Why does he need a practice?

00:10:05,165 --> 00:10:05,665
He's a talented singer!

158
00:10:06,132 --> 00:10:08,033

This is the present trend now!

161
00:10:11,766 --> 00:10:13,234
l didn't get those opportunities.

162
00:10:13,532 --> 00:10:14,666
Let him punuewhatever he likes!!

163
00:10:15,099 --> 00:10:17,501

l search formemories in my heart.

175
00:11:45,165 --> 00:11:50,169
When the waiting sunlight is shy,

Just as night dream is awakened,

the night flowers adorned
with little sprouts.

185
00:13:01,766 --> 00:13:07,271

00:14:24,165 --> 00:14:25,332
While drinking alone!

00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:27,667

What is the problem, mom?

226
00:15:37,099 --> 00:15:39,067
Blood Canceris not a
contagious disease.

227
00:15:39,632 --> 00:15:41,400
Moreoverhe is in the
earlierphase ofdisease,

228

You know, Omana's husband, in Dubai,
doesn't even drink a drop!

00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:09,634
Do you hold that guy's liquor

Whythis sudden desire of
becoming a Swimming Champion?

301
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:01,766
_ot dad, it's my mom'swish!

302
00:20:02,232 --> 00:20:04,000
My dad wishes me to playforIPL.

303
00:20:04,265 --> 00:20:05,666
He's still a great fan of Tendulkar,

304
00:20:06,099 --> 00:20:06,399
and l'm Kohli's!

305
00:20:07,432 --> 00:20:09,100
Don'tyou wish to make him a Doctor?

306
00:20:09,432 --> 00:20:11,667
Yes, but he can also play and swim too,

307
00:20:12,099 --> 00:20:13,500
and this is the right age also.

308
00:20:14,699 --> 00:20:18,602
l agree, but pursuing
all at the same time,

309
00:20:19,132 --> 00:20:20,466
deprive him of his childhood ??

310
00:20:21,733 --> 00:20:24,135
Do you think he's an extra4rdinay guy
to excel in all these?

311
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:27,734
As he's myson, he surelycan't!

00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,367
Oh dad..!

314
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,367
This temperament,
is your main problem, Venu!

315
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:37,167
Any fatherwill lose his temperament,

316
00:20:37,399 --> 00:20:38,099
on seeing his children being criticized!

317
00:20:39,099 --> 00:20:41,501
Thiswill be the state if
Fathers become Principals!!

318
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:42,499
Correct!

319
00:20:43,332 --> 00:20:45,367
Get into the class after
bringing your dad!

320
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:47,434

321
00:20:48,265 --> 00:20:52,202
l'm already ashamed of his character!

322
00:20:57,632 --> 00:20:59,300
Clever boy!!! He'll come up in life!!!

323
00:20:59,566 --> 00:21:00,366
Hm...! He will come up....!

324
00:21:01,632 --> 00:21:03,500

326
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,267
Let him scrape through it this yearalso.

327
00:21:13,632 --> 00:21:17,035
Steep rise in Gold, has ensued
rise in adulterationtoo,

328
00:21:17,299 --> 00:21:18,133
That's my tension!

329
00:21:21,399 --> 00:21:25,402
l am not satisfied even
after rubbing it too much!

330
00:21:26,366 --> 00:21:28,000
Don't take too much oftension!

331
00:21:28,199 --> 00:21:29,700
There are other banks also here.

332
00:21:30,632 --> 00:21:34,135
ButAnand Finance is different
from other banks!

333
00:21:34,399 --> 00:21:35,466
Oh, you mean this Petty shop is it?!!

334

00:22:00,699 --> 00:22:03,134
Fraudulent Finance!!

337

This is period where, one cantake
gold loan within 3 minutes,

340
00:22:09,065 --> 00:22:11,333
And he still uses his barbarian set up!!

Do you want him to get

What am l supposed to do now?

350

You'll say, gold value will decline,

Even ifhe's afrog in the well,

448
00:27:03,666 --> 00:27:06,101
There's a reason for Omanachechi
going to mm daily!

449
00:27:06,332 --> 00:27:06,965
Slowly!

450
00:27:07,666 --> 00:27:08,333
What's the motive?

451
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,002

And the poor Doctoris struggling
Hard under Dubai's heat!

456
00:27:25,666 --> 00:27:28,301
As l was there last day,

l received Doctofs call.

458
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:31,633
But Omanachechi was in Gym thattime.

459
00:27:33,065 --> 00:27:34,366
When Doctor asked me, ''Where is she''

460
00:27:34,566 --> 00:27:36,301

461
00:27:37,366 --> 00:27:39,167

00:27:41,566 --> 00:27:42,333
You shouldn't have done that, Hima!!!

464
00:27:42,766 --> 00:27:44,534

the Colony people find it difficult,

478
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:11,566
as per Dr.Omana's opinion!

479
00:28:12,632 --> 00:28:14,000
Comparing the current
Real Estate business,

480
00:28:14,199 --> 00:28:16,467
mydad nowfeels his
old fish business is far better.

481
00:28:17,165 --> 00:28:18,332

00:30:37,766 --> 00:30:38,199
Please sit down, Omana.

532
00:30:40,099 --> 00:30:42,134
Venu, tell me, how can we solve this issue?

533
00:30:42,332 --> 00:30:43,266
What solution?

534
00:30:43,499 --> 00:30:46,335
Will Jimmy undentand that
Colonel is an army man?

535
00:30:46,632 --> 00:30:47,332
Does it have sense?

536
00:30:49,099 --> 00:30:51,067
Colonel isjust a distant uncle ofyou!!

537
00:30:53,199 --> 00:30:55,000
And whydoyou have to wory about it?

538
00:30:55,199 --> 00:30:56,466
Mom, please come..

539
00:30:57,632 --> 00:30:58,466
Don't shoot up your
pressure unnecessarily!

540
00:30:59,699 --> 00:31:01,700
Eveyone here knows
what all she shoots up in Gym!!

541
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:04,467
-Will you please be quiet?
-What didyou say?

542
00:31:06,165 --> 00:31:07,666
lsthere any point in
unnecessarilytalking and wasting time?

543
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:10,434
Dog didn't bite heruncle
on the public road,

544
00:31:10,733 --> 00:31:12,434
but at thefrontyard of my house!!

545
00:31:13,165 --> 00:31:14,966
Who asked him to come inside?

546
00:31:15,199 --> 00:31:16,099
Let hergive avalid answerforthis!!

547
00:31:16,299 --> 00:31:17,099
Hell with his dog and cow!!!

548
00:31:17,299 --> 00:31:19,501
Who asked youto rearcow
in your10 cents ofland?

549
00:31:19,733 --> 00:31:21,601
l'll decide what l should do,

550
00:31:22,032 --> 00:31:22,699
don_ teach me!

551
00:31:23,099 --> 00:31:24,366
l'll give you asolution!

552
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:27,134
Due to security reason,
current situation demands a dog!

553
00:31:27,466 --> 00:31:28,300
Yes tell them!

554
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:30,667
That doesn't mean you've to untie
the dog during day time?

555
00:31:31,232 --> 00:31:31,599
Any need? _o, isn't it?

556
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:34,735
l will decidewhen and
how to let mydog free!

557
00:31:35,299 --> 00:31:38,001
Gandhiji gave freedom
forthem too in 1997!

558
00:31:38,199 --> 00:31:39,733
ltwas not in 1997 but 1947!!

559
00:31:40,132 --> 00:31:42,100
Whateverit may be!!
Great discovey!!

560
00:31:42,466 --> 00:31:44,734
_ow you understood it was
futile to talk to him!!

561
00:31:45,299 --> 00:31:47,167
lfthis committee can't find a solution,

562
00:31:47,432 --> 00:31:48,399
l knowwhatto do!!

563
00:31:48,632 --> 00:31:50,100
Don't frighten me!!!
l may get frightened!

564
00:31:50,599 --> 00:31:51,399
Oh God!! What anuisance is this!!

565
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:52,666
Venu, please come here....
Come here l say!

566
00:31:53,232 --> 00:31:54,533
Come, let me talk to you,

567
00:31:54,733 --> 00:31:55,967
regarding the garbage issue.

568
00:31:56,165 --> 00:31:57,232
l've nothing more to discuss here!

569
00:31:57,432 --> 00:31:57,732
We too!

570
00:31:58,132 --> 00:32:00,100
Don't get heated up!!!
This generation is bad!!

571
00:32:00,632 --> 00:32:03,034
lt is more difficult to deal with
animals than with human beings!

572
00:32:03,265 --> 00:32:05,367
There are many associations
to take care ofthem.

573
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:08,568
Shambu sir, it's my land,
my house, mydog and my cow!

574
00:32:09,165 --> 00:32:10,132
Yes l agree toyourpoint!

575
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:14,369
lf complains that you are torturing the cow
for a month without providing propertreatment,

576
00:32:14,632 --> 00:32:18,402
is given by Omana, to Animal Welfare board,

577
00:32:18,632 --> 00:32:19,532
do you know its consequences?

578
00:32:19,766 --> 00:32:21,601
lt's anon bailable offence!!

579
00:32:21,766 --> 00:32:22,733
You'll be grilled!!!

580
00:32:23,165 --> 00:32:25,133
Can l force the cowto give birth?

581
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:28,201
Any point in talking philosophy
aRer being grilled?

582
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:29,433
lsn't it a disgrace?!!

583
00:32:29,632 --> 00:32:31,200
To avoid that only, l am telling this!

584
00:32:31,399 --> 00:32:32,233
Settle this as early as possible.

585
00:32:33,399 --> 00:32:35,534
-_ot out!!!-Get lost!!!

586
00:32:36,232 --> 00:32:37,333
Hey, what nonsense areyou doing?

587
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:38,699
They are just playing...

588
00:32:39,132 --> 00:32:39,632
lt happened bymistake, Uncle!

589
00:32:40,165 --> 00:32:41,499
l'm okay dad!!! Doesn't matter!!

590
00:32:42,032 --> 00:32:43,099
Doesn_ matter!? Towhom?!!!

591
00:32:43,399 --> 00:32:44,967
He has to appearfor his
entrance exam next month.

592
00:32:45,165 --> 00:32:47,200
This fall is enough to lose ayear
ifhe breaks the spinal cord.

593
00:32:47,666 --> 00:32:48,433
Sory uncle!!!

594
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:50,066
Come here son!

595
00:32:52,566 --> 00:32:53,433
Sory dad!

596
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:55,701
Shambu sir, please don't feel
hurt if l say something.

597
00:32:56,132 --> 00:32:57,566
A sick child has to be
brought up in adifferentway,

598
00:32:57,799 --> 00:32:59,033
and not be a hindranceto others!!

599
00:32:59,399 --> 00:33:00,032
Enough of playing!!!

600
00:33:10,099 --> 00:33:11,200
He's getting better now dad!!!

601
00:33:11,499 --> 00:33:12,600
He's undergoing herbal treatment!

602
00:33:13,132 --> 00:33:15,067
Herbal treatment for Blood Cancer?!!!

603
00:33:15,366 --> 00:33:15,999
You're not hurt, aren't you?

604
00:33:23,099 --> 00:33:23,666
Stand still!!!

605
00:33:24,065 --> 00:33:25,199
Move ittowards left!!

606
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:26,266
Turn it this way!

607
00:33:27,632 --> 00:33:28,666
And now fasten it there.

608
00:33:41,099 --> 00:33:44,068
Didn't l askyou about
its feasibility here?

609
00:33:44,699 --> 00:33:46,400
That's the suitable place for her!!

610
00:33:46,532 --> 00:33:49,635
lfcow is there, nobodywould
come and sue orflght!

611
00:33:52,032 --> 00:33:52,399
Have lunch and go.

612
00:33:52,566 --> 00:33:54,701
_ot necessay!!!

613
00:33:55,666 --> 00:33:56,266
Shall l go, dear?

614
00:33:56,566 --> 00:33:57,300
See you then!

615
00:33:59,566 --> 00:34:01,434
_ext week is ourmom's death annivenay.

616
00:34:01,666 --> 00:34:02,666
Eveyone must come.

617
00:34:03,466 --> 00:34:04,500
_ext week...?

618
00:34:05,432 --> 00:34:05,732
Forgot it ah?!

619
00:34:07,332 --> 00:34:07,699
_ot that really..

620
00:34:08,332 --> 00:34:10,000
_ever mind! Too busy, right?

621
00:34:10,466 --> 00:34:12,301
_ow l'm there to remindthis!!

622
00:34:12,532 --> 00:34:13,666
Tomomow, l may not be there.

623
00:34:14,666 --> 00:34:17,468
But always keep in mind that
ourparents are laid in that soil!!

624
00:34:17,666 --> 00:34:18,700
_o brother, l'll surely come....

625
00:34:19,065 --> 00:34:20,199
lt slipped awayfrom mymind!

626
00:34:21,332 --> 00:34:22,299
See you then!!

627
00:34:23,332 --> 00:34:23,732
Move then!

628
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:37,733
-Yes madam
- Prepare a sweet today!!!

629
00:34:38,165 --> 00:34:39,266
Daughter's results have come!!

630
00:34:39,432 --> 00:34:40,332
She isthe class topper!!

631
00:34:40,532 --> 00:34:42,000
Does she also work in
Omanachechi's house?

632
00:34:42,566 --> 00:34:44,100
Yes, main person of Omana!!

633
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:45,266
And we're nothing!!

634
00:34:45,733 --> 00:34:48,435
Hell with her....her daughter
and herfirst rank!!

635
00:34:55,299 --> 00:34:56,533
l'm totallyfed up ofthis life, Mohanan!

636
00:34:56,766 --> 00:34:57,566
Get me the chicken!

637
00:34:58,065 --> 00:35:00,167
What inclined you to think so?

638
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:01,666
You'll not understand.

639
00:35:02,065 --> 00:35:03,433
Being a higher grade teacher,

640
00:35:03,632 --> 00:35:04,699
you earn a hefty salayeveymonth,

641
00:35:05,099 --> 00:35:06,733
Thus you hold some
respect before Mohan!!

642
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:07,966
But my situation is different.

643
00:35:08,265 --> 00:35:10,700
Evenfor apenny,
l have to depend on him.

644
00:35:12,399 --> 00:35:15,001
Thenwhy didyou quit
your banking profession?

645
00:35:15,399 --> 00:35:17,200
Yes!! l made a mistake that day!!

646
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,168
As l was newly married,
l didn_ think ofthese things!

647
00:35:20,265 --> 00:35:22,233
Shouldn't there be someone
to lead me to the right path?

648
00:35:22,466 --> 00:35:25,235
lf onlyl'd hadthatjob,
l wonderwhat l'd have become!

649
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:29,002
_o point ofusing teeth clips
onlyduring nights!!

650
00:35:29,265 --> 00:35:30,032
Gum contourwill rise up!!

651
00:35:30,399 --> 00:35:31,566
Come to clinic nextweek!!

652
00:35:31,799 --> 00:35:33,133
Let's do Fixed Ortho!

653
00:35:33,466 --> 00:35:36,202
Youjust be quiet!!!
She has no gum problems!

654
00:35:37,366 --> 00:35:39,601
lf it's fixed,
then l won't be able to remove it.

655
00:35:39,799 --> 00:35:40,432
Yes, that's not possible!

656
00:35:41,265 --> 00:35:43,767
What'll people comment if
l put on the teeth clip during day?

657
00:35:44,799 --> 00:35:46,300
For that reason,
should l stop using teeth clips?

658
00:35:46,466 --> 00:35:49,068
For last School day, when
l had been toAnukuttan's school,

659
00:35:49,399 --> 00:35:50,733
he felt embarrassed to introduce
me as his mom to his friends,

660
00:35:51,366 --> 00:35:52,667
this was the reason for that!

661
00:35:53,232 --> 00:35:55,133
Youjust don_ assume things!!!

662
00:35:55,432 --> 00:35:58,168
My life will end inthis kitchen!!

663
00:35:58,432 --> 00:35:59,466
l've severe headache!!
Get me a cup of tea!

664
00:35:59,733 --> 00:36:00,700
Damn it!!!

665
00:36:01,132 --> 00:36:03,067
You haveto take a
decision of him today!

666
00:36:03,399 --> 00:36:04,199
What's wrong with him?

667
00:36:04,432 --> 00:36:06,133
Do you think he would study
and pass the entnnce?

668
00:36:06,466 --> 00:36:07,366
lfthat doesn't happen,

669
00:36:07,566 --> 00:36:09,501
then, l'll have to hang myself
to death before Omana!

670
00:36:10,232 --> 00:36:11,066
Are you studying well?

671
00:36:11,366 --> 00:36:13,401
As he'syourson,
don_ have too much expectations!

672
00:36:14,599 --> 00:36:16,367
Oh! You're too brilliant
to become a Collector!

673
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:18,200
Don't provoke me in front ofthem!

674
00:36:19,232 --> 00:36:20,066
-Actually she didn_ mean that!
-What else then?

675
00:36:20,432 --> 00:36:22,700
As aprecaution, what ifwe ty
fora seat inAmala College?

676
00:36:23,232 --> 00:36:24,166
He needn't lose ayear, right?

677
00:36:25,232 --> 00:36:26,166
What'll be the capitation fee there?

678
00:36:26,566 --> 00:36:27,600
They charge 40 blindly!!

679
00:36:28,399 --> 00:36:29,166
Even tug ofwarforthat seat!

680
00:36:29,532 --> 00:36:31,367
l'll discuss this with Father.

681
00:36:32,199 --> 00:36:33,233
He regularly visits my clinic.

682
00:36:33,432 --> 00:36:34,366
Suppose ifhe gets us anyconcession...

683
00:36:34,733 --> 00:36:36,134
What more to think?

684
00:36:36,399 --> 00:36:38,033
For whom are you hoarding
all this money?

685
00:36:38,199 --> 00:36:39,433
mll you let me in peace?

686
00:36:40,399 --> 00:36:41,500
Won'tyou get in merit?

687
00:36:42,299 --> 00:36:43,400
_ot sure!!

688
00:36:44,532 --> 00:36:46,033
lt's veytough dad!!!

689
00:36:46,399 --> 00:36:47,299
And onlyfew seats are available!

690
00:36:47,532 --> 00:36:48,499
ln that case, this is the best!!

691
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:50,666
And that's also comfortable.

692
00:36:51,099 --> 00:36:51,766
He can stay at home and pursue.

693
00:37:02,399 --> 00:37:05,235
Hey go man.....go man..

694
00:37:05,632 --> 00:37:06,332
Oh no...oh myGod!!

695
00:37:12,699 --> 00:37:15,701
lfyou'rewilling to pay
Capitation feefor medicine seat,

696
00:37:16,366 --> 00:37:18,000
Why don_ you look outfor
admission in Bangalore?

697
00:37:18,299 --> 00:37:18,666
Bangalore?

698
00:37:19,165 --> 00:37:20,266
Yes, even the Capitation
cost will also be less.

699
00:37:20,699 --> 00:37:22,267
These are enough to spoil the children!!

700
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:24,000
lt's enough ifhe studies from here!

701
00:37:27,299 --> 00:37:28,500
ln his age, till now,

702
00:37:28,699 --> 00:37:30,734
you've not let him for
one daytouralso!

703
00:37:31,699 --> 00:37:33,400
At least now let him catch
a glimpse ofthe World!

704
00:37:33,766 --> 00:37:36,001
Can you totalk to
Father Rector regardingthis?

705
00:37:36,366 --> 00:37:38,401
Even ifwe pay40, seemsthere's
admission onlyfornext year!

706
00:37:38,632 --> 00:37:39,532
Won't he lose ayearthen?

707
00:37:39,733 --> 00:37:41,201
Rectorwill never discard yourwords!

708
00:37:41,699 --> 00:37:42,466
l'll surely meet him,

709
00:37:42,699 --> 00:37:45,368
as that shouldn't sabotage his future!!

710
00:37:47,165 --> 00:37:48,099
But what l feel is,

711
00:37:49,165 --> 00:37:50,099
Good Lord!!!! Pull him up!!

712
00:37:50,566 --> 00:37:50,999
Pull him up!!

713
00:37:55,566 --> 00:37:56,266

00:38:04,599 --> 00:38:06,100
Where on earth did the teacher disappear?

716
00:38:06,332 --> 00:38:07,132
Don't get tensed!

717
00:38:07,332 --> 00:38:08,700
Only if he consumes some water,
he will learn swimming.

718
00:38:09,099 --> 00:38:10,433
You don_ have to teach him
swimming anymore!

719
00:38:10,666 --> 00:38:11,466
Stop it right away.

720
00:38:11,699 --> 00:38:12,766
_o, he's picking up veyfast!

721
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:14,366
Whatever he picked up so far is enough!

722
00:38:14,566 --> 00:38:16,100
Better reimburse the fees
amount and get lost!!

723
00:38:16,366 --> 00:38:17,767
See, this is howthe world is!!

724
00:38:18,299 --> 00:38:19,700
lf awayfrom my sight, then finished!!

725
00:38:20,332 --> 00:38:20,699
And you talk of Bangalore?!

726
00:38:22,332 --> 00:38:24,500
Father is also recommending
for your seat!

727
00:38:25,265 --> 00:38:27,100
Better study hard for
5 more years and pass.

728

And then get you mamied aRer demanding
dowyofwhateverl spentforyou

When l imagine of his marriage,
l get tensed

732
00:38:37,499 --> 00:38:39,267
Earlier Kousthubham hall
would've been adequate!

00:38:39,499 --> 00:38:40,566
Butwe have Lulu here,

734
00:38:41,299 --> 00:38:44,435

anyfunction over there!!

735
00:38:45,232 --> 00:38:46,533
Anything lesswon't look good!

736
00:38:47,632 --> 00:38:49,633
Being a Priest,
you needn't wory about that!

737
00:39:09,232 --> 00:39:09,599

1053
01:03:08,399 --> 01:03:10,067

1055
01:04:06,199 --> 01:04:08,134
Why didn'tyou come home?

l came here directly.

1057
01:04:13,666 --> 01:04:16,468
and saw, the place he's been laid down
covered with thorns and bushes.

1058
01:04:18,032 --> 01:04:18,732
As l was busywith harvesting,

1059
01:04:19,165 --> 01:04:20,633

1197
01:17:13,332 --> 01:17:14,166

1198
01:17:15,332 --> 01:17:18,301

1236
01:18:40,666 --> 01:18:41,400
Get inside

1237
01:18:44,466 --> 01:18:45,767
Half-yearly exam is nearing!

1238
01:18:46,199 --> 01:18:47,700
Lotsto study. Bye then!

1239
01:18:52,032 --> 01:18:53,700
He's afnid l would cast
myevil eye on him.

1240
01:18:54,399 --> 01:18:56,234
Don't make suchwild guesses!

1241
01:18:56,799 --> 01:18:58,734
Have no tension about me...

1242
01:18:59,232 --> 01:19:00,366
orher!

1243
01:19:01,766 --> 01:19:02,633
We'll not commit suicide!

1244
01:19:03,232 --> 01:19:04,666
_ot because wewish to live,

1245
01:19:05,733 --> 01:19:08,335
But by an unnatural death
we never can reach him.

1246
01:19:09,232 --> 01:19:10,266
That's the Shastn!

1247
01:19:11,766 --> 01:19:12,366
Venuchetta!

1248
01:19:16,733 --> 01:19:17,200
Chechi!

1249
01:19:19,566 --> 01:19:20,633
When didyou amive?

1250
01:19:21,032 --> 01:19:24,068
Fearing Venucheta's scolding
if l returned without money,

1251
01:19:24,399 --> 01:19:25,533
l was working in my hometown.

1252
01:19:26,566 --> 01:19:28,067
ln the meantime,
such a tngedy happened.

1253
01:19:31,366 --> 01:19:34,502
Anand dearhad given methis money.

1254
01:19:35,733 --> 01:19:38,202
l got my house repaired withthis,

1255
01:19:38,432 --> 01:19:39,699
and left myfamily safe there.

1256
01:19:41,632 --> 01:19:43,433
Please accept this money, Venuchetta!

1257
01:20:04,199 --> 01:20:07,569
Money paid forAnand's Medical college
admission will not be reimbursed.

1258
01:20:08,532 --> 01:20:10,333
lt's their policy!

1259
01:20:12,199 --> 01:20:14,234
l also tried all possibilities!

1260
01:20:15,532 --> 01:20:17,100
lfyou offersome more cash,

1261
01:20:17,532 --> 01:20:21,302
they are ready to keepAnand's name
fortheir new block,

1262
01:20:22,699 --> 01:20:24,500
l told to confirm it after
discussing with you.

1263
01:20:27,432 --> 01:20:30,301
Why naming a lifeless
building aRer my son?

1264
01:20:32,165 --> 01:20:32,999
lt's not that...
As it's not a meagre sum..

1265
01:20:35,699 --> 01:20:38,401
Canyou guess how much
these papers areworth?

1266
01:20:39,699 --> 01:20:41,467
l was checking these accounts,

1267
01:20:42,366 --> 01:20:44,134
Crores...Worth Crores!

1268
01:20:45,165 --> 01:20:48,468
Most ofthem were made bymy cheating,
manipulating and over smartness!

1269
01:20:50,599 --> 01:20:51,733
l felttoo proud then!

1270
01:20:53,399 --> 01:20:53,999
_ow...

1271
01:20:54,366 --> 01:20:55,300

1272
01:20:57,733 --> 01:20:58,633
Calm down Venu!!

1273
01:20:59,599 --> 01:21:01,100
_othing is in ourhands!

1274
01:21:01,299 --> 01:21:03,000
How can l tolerate?

01:21:04,366 --> 01:21:07,235
,
Just abit.... Ifa bit of life
was left in his body,

1276
01:21:07,432 --> 01:21:09,967
l would've got him treated
an_here inthe World.

1277
01:21:10,332 --> 01:21:11,566
Didn't give an opportunity forthat!

1278
01:21:54,232 --> 01:21:54,665

01:23:13,699 --> 01:23:16,435
Onlytoday he'd been to hospital

1300
01:23:17,032 --> 01:23:18,566
So, l brought him here.

01:23:25,566 --> 01:23:28,302
He has some food restrictions

1305
01:23:28,666 --> 01:23:30,567
And then back to School,

Doctor, eh?

1314
01:24:20,799 --> 01:24:22,267

1316
01:24:32,099 --> 01:24:33,266
Sir, but please give me some time.

1317
01:24:37,299 --> 01:24:40,268

01:24:40,766 --> 01:24:41,700

1319

1321
01:24:48,499 --> 01:24:49,700
Should we reallywoythis much?

1322
01:24:56,299 --> 01:24:56,732

1324
01:25:06,466 --> 01:25:12,138
Avail special loan for Health,
Education and wedding,

1325
01:25:12,332 --> 01:25:14,067
with 100/o interest!

1326
01:25:15,032 --> 01:25:20,470
Gold loan pergram is Rs.2500 -Anand Finance!

1327
01:25:21,499 --> 01:25:23,133
Has he gone crazy?

1328
01:25:23,733 --> 01:25:28,304
lsn't 100/o interest much
Iowerthan Bank ntes?

1329
01:25:28,532 --> 01:25:28,665
Yes!

1330
01:25:30,132 --> 01:25:30,765
Gone Mad?

1331
01:25:31,265 --> 01:25:33,467
Can anybody sustain his business?

1332
01:25:34,466 --> 01:25:37,202
Rs.2500 per gram?!

1333
01:25:38,099 --> 01:25:39,266
What is he up to?

1334
01:25:39,466 --> 01:25:40,600
Let me call Venu!

1335
01:25:41,232 --> 01:25:45,336
Wait, let's know its development
and then call him.

1336
01:25:46,132 --> 01:25:49,435
Might be the end ofeveything!

1337
01:25:50,065 --> 01:25:56,404
l told ofmerging his company
to Manavallan Finance forfair price.

1338
01:25:57,032 --> 01:25:59,367
But denied inthe pretext
ofSon's sentiments!

1339
01:26:00,232 --> 01:26:02,701
Such fellows will never
listen when advised!

1340
01:26:03,099 --> 01:26:04,366
_ow see what happened!

1341
01:26:05,165 --> 01:26:06,533
lfVenu starts giving such loans,

1342
01:26:07,032 --> 01:26:08,266
will anybody approach our company?

1343
01:26:09,699 --> 01:26:11,133
Can we take legal action?

1344
01:26:11,399 --> 01:26:11,732
Yes!

1345
01:26:12,232 --> 01:26:17,470
Private chit funds are supposed to
charge only 20/o interest more than banks,

1346
01:26:17,799 --> 01:26:19,333
do we abide that?

1347
01:26:20,099 --> 01:26:22,601
lfa penon is willingto
give in a low interest nte,

1348
01:26:23,099 --> 01:26:24,600
-Whatjudiciay can do?
-That's true!

1349
01:26:25,099 --> 01:26:27,167
Will he be troublesome
forus infuture?

1350
01:26:28,299 --> 01:26:32,302
Howfarwill afrog leap
in an abandoned well?

1351
01:26:33,065 --> 01:26:34,266
His company...

1352
01:26:34,666 --> 01:26:36,200
...will be on this palm..

1353
01:26:36,399 --> 01:26:38,501
..just a matter of time!

1354
01:26:39,032 --> 01:26:39,632
You watch!

1355
01:26:49,766 --> 01:26:51,000
l was aboutto call you!

1356
01:26:51,232 --> 01:26:52,166
Seeing the PaperAd,
we received 100s ofcalls,

1357
01:26:52,399 --> 01:26:54,000
since this moming.

1358
01:26:54,399 --> 01:26:55,299
They've come to avail loans!

1359
01:26:56,199 --> 01:26:56,999
What should l do?

1360
01:26:57,666 --> 01:26:58,266
Who's inside?

1361
01:26:58,666 --> 01:26:59,400
Your brother and Co- brother!

1362
01:27:00,399 --> 01:27:02,000
They are not going home...
theywant to meetyou here.

1363
01:27:03,632 --> 01:27:04,566
What am l supposed to do?

1364
01:27:05,065 --> 01:27:08,468
Verify the documents ofthose who've come.
l'll tell you what to do.

1365
01:27:16,766 --> 01:27:18,367
What's that matter that
you can't discuss at home?

1366
01:27:21,366 --> 01:27:21,599
_ot that...

1367
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,469
We'll feel free to discuss here.

1368
01:27:26,099 --> 01:27:27,467
What's there to discuss so freely?

1369
01:27:30,366 --> 01:27:36,605
All ofus feel thatyou
throw moneyto some stnngers!

1370
01:27:37,032 --> 01:27:40,001
They're not some strangers
but deserving people

1371
01:27:41,032 --> 01:27:43,300
But when will the money be worthy?

1372
01:27:44,265 --> 01:27:45,633
Onlywhen it goes to the
hand ofdeserving people,

1373
01:27:46,032 --> 01:27:47,733
lt's okayyou helped Aslam...

1374
01:27:48,599 --> 01:27:50,567
But do you think all
people here are genuine?

1375
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:52,134
Most ofthem are tricksters!

1376
01:27:52,332 --> 01:27:55,201
Don't we verify their documents?

1377
01:27:55,466 --> 01:27:56,266
What documents?

1378
01:27:57,132 --> 01:27:58,066
What absurdity!

1379
01:27:58,432 --> 01:28:01,568
_ot even a single penon
will repaythis loan!!

1380
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:04,334
l decided only after adeep thought

1381
01:28:05,332 --> 01:28:07,033
l'm neither concemed of profit nor loss,

1382
01:28:07,599 --> 01:28:08,700
But peace ofmind!

1383
01:28:10,799 --> 01:28:12,734
l need some ray ofhope,

1384
01:28:13,132 --> 01:28:14,299
to sustain my life until death?

1385
01:28:19,332 --> 01:28:22,735
Orshall l leave mydaughter
at yourhomefor sometime?

1386
01:28:23,766 --> 01:28:25,267
Herpresence will give you a relief!!

1387
01:28:25,733 --> 01:28:26,700
Let herstaythere and study!

1388
01:28:27,766 --> 01:28:29,167
l can also come and meet her oRen.

1389
01:28:29,699 --> 01:28:33,469
There was atime,
l was more money-minded than you

1390
01:28:36,566 --> 01:28:37,466
And you knowwhat happened!

1391

Are you coming with me, brother?

1395
01:28:50,065 --> 01:28:51,299
Brother, you also tell me

1396
01:28:52,265 --> 01:28:53,432
Whyforgothat ??

1397

You dowhateveryou feel is right.

01:28:59,499 --> 01:29:01,300
Do it ifyou reallyfeel peaceful!!

1399
01:29:01,766 --> 01:29:03,134
This brother is always with you!

1400
01:29:28,632 --> 01:29:30,367
This was my playground
during my childhood days!

1401
01:29:31,532 --> 01:29:34,001
This company was
my dad's life and breath!

1402
01:29:34,532 --> 01:29:37,134
Surprising to see a
Doctoroperating Cnne!

1403
01:29:38,265 --> 01:29:39,265
This is my dad's offlce!

1404
01:29:40,232 --> 01:29:42,701
Even now l'm afraidto
sit on this chair!

1405
01:29:44,065 --> 01:29:45,433
lsn't it difficult to handle both
company and hospital panllely?

1406
01:29:46,265 --> 01:29:48,000
One hourdailyis enough here.

1407
01:29:48,499 --> 01:29:51,001
We can flnd time ifwe reallywant!

1408
01:29:53,599 --> 01:29:56,134
After dad's demise,
l had a tying time!

1409
01:29:57,499 --> 01:29:58,433
Despite having so much wealth,

1410
01:29:58,766 --> 01:30:01,335
He buys onlythe cheapestfish!

1411
01:30:01,632 --> 01:30:02,632
That shows his stinginess!

1412
01:30:03,766 --> 01:30:06,168
On the 14th day ofmy dad's death,

1413
01:30:06,399 --> 01:30:07,533
l metVenu sirforthe firsttime.

1414
01:30:12,733 --> 01:30:13,633
Here comes my mom!

1415
01:30:17,032 --> 01:30:19,467
Have it!! Home-made snacks!

1416
01:30:20,165 --> 01:30:22,634
As l said, you can't
escape from eating now!

1417
01:30:25,132 --> 01:30:26,299
Come here wheneveryou find time.

1418
01:30:26,499 --> 01:30:27,233
Okay.

1419
01:30:29,466 --> 01:30:33,436
l suggested _andhini chechi to engage
in something instead ofbeing idle.

1420
01:30:34,065 --> 01:30:36,434
Atthattime only, the idea of
Private College sprung up!

1421
01:30:37,466 --> 01:30:38,967
Teaching in College?!!

1422
01:30:39,165 --> 01:30:40,099
Actually you don_ know herwell!

1423
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:42,434
She has good confldence.

1424
01:30:43,099 --> 01:30:45,334
She has alsoworked in a bank earlier.

1425
01:30:45,666 --> 01:30:47,968
She can teach Economics,
the subject that she'd studied

1426
01:30:48,466 --> 01:30:50,100
Economics?
She?

1427
01:30:51,466 --> 01:30:52,433
Don_ tyto ridicule me!

1428
01:30:52,666 --> 01:30:54,100
Anyhow l've decided to give it aty,

1429
01:30:54,666 --> 01:30:56,167
as l've been conflned within four walls!!

1430
01:30:57,466 --> 01:30:59,301
-Hats offto you!!-Thank you!

1431
01:31:00,466 --> 01:31:01,767
This credit also goes toJayashree, right ?

1432
01:31:02,199 --> 01:31:02,599
Did l say so?

1433
01:31:04,199 --> 01:31:06,634
_o tiffbemeen you both forthis reason!!

1434
01:31:10,132 --> 01:31:10,699
Shall we leave?
See you!

1435
01:31:39,065 --> 01:31:42,268
12 persons have already redeemed
gold loan this week !!

1436
01:31:42,733 --> 01:31:45,402
Seeing a person doing a
business with such dignity,

1437
01:31:45,666 --> 01:31:49,269
People complain that
we charge exorbitant interest,

1438
01:31:49,599 --> 01:31:52,368
You can't saythatthis didn_
affectyourfinance company...

1439
01:31:52,632 --> 01:31:54,033
Just call your branch and check.

1440
01:31:54,632 --> 01:31:56,233
Many people are still unaware of it!

1441
01:31:56,632 --> 01:31:58,700
lt betterto _ip in the bud !

1442
01:32:03,599 --> 01:32:04,232
Here he comes!!

1443
01:32:06,532 --> 01:32:08,600
You're not seen here offlate!

1444
01:32:09,399 --> 01:32:10,199
Sit down!

1445
01:32:11,399 --> 01:32:12,733
How is your business?

1446
01:32:15,399 --> 01:32:16,700
Goes well!! Why meet me urgently?

1447
01:32:17,799 --> 01:32:18,766
Regarding business only.

1448
01:32:19,632 --> 01:32:22,234
There is nothing to conceal while talking!

1449
01:32:23,132 --> 01:32:25,567
Do you think you can sustain this company,

1450
01:32:25,799 --> 01:32:27,767
forthis specifled rate of interest?

1451
01:32:29,366 --> 01:32:31,034
Afterthe flrst excitement,

1452
01:32:31,566 --> 01:32:33,000
and when business volume increases,

1453
01:32:33,232 --> 01:32:34,633
then you'll understand it's repercussions!

1454
01:32:35,199 --> 01:32:36,133
l've the experience!

1455
01:32:37,132 --> 01:32:38,967
lt'll cary on like this for timebeing,

1456
01:32:39,499 --> 01:32:40,299
and about future...

1457
01:32:40,699 --> 01:32:43,334
l've also stopped thinking since few days,

1458
01:32:44,566 --> 01:32:45,733
thus there's no point!

1459
01:32:46,366 --> 01:32:48,234
lfyourson is dead and ifyou feel idle,

1460
01:32:48,499 --> 01:32:50,200
then do meditation in someAshram!

1461
01:32:52,366 --> 01:32:54,534
lnstead, why are you troubling others!

1462
01:32:58,599 --> 01:33:01,735
Joshy, l'll talkto him...

1463
01:33:04,132 --> 01:33:07,134
Venu, a tragedy occurred in your life!

1464
01:33:08,132 --> 01:33:08,765
And wetoo feel sory about it!

1465
01:33:10,065 --> 01:33:13,101
Butwe are also doing business
in the samefield!

1466
01:33:13,532 --> 01:33:15,033
lfyou start likethis,

1467
01:33:15,432 --> 01:33:16,499
how can we sustain?

1468
01:33:18,065 --> 01:33:20,467
l neverwished to putyou
into trouble deliberately!

1469
01:33:21,499 --> 01:33:24,435
l can understand what you're saying.
l too had done it earlier!

1470
01:33:24,632 --> 01:33:26,734
But now, l can only do this!

1471
01:33:27,699 --> 01:33:30,268
Onlywhen l go tothat Nflce,
l feel like living!

1472
01:33:30,666 --> 01:33:32,300
Please forgive me!

1473
01:33:39,632 --> 01:33:43,469
l'll decidewhether l go to
Ashram ordo Bhajans!

1474
01:33:44,499 --> 01:33:46,267
Whatever l do now, is what my son likes!

1475
01:33:47,532 --> 01:33:49,267
He's seeing itfrom above...
and also enjoying it!

1476
01:33:50,466 --> 01:33:51,533
That belief is my confidence!

1477
01:33:52,632 --> 01:33:56,669
How long will you run
the business opposing us?

1478
01:33:57,299 --> 01:33:59,100
Let me also watch it!

1479
01:33:59,566 --> 01:34:01,634
l'm afrog in an abandoned well!

1480
01:34:02,632 --> 01:34:04,333
l know myweaknesswell, but...

1481
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:08,735
l've something which you guys don't have,

1482
01:34:10,499 --> 01:34:11,132
a desire to die!

1483
01:34:12,466 --> 01:34:12,766
Whenyoufeel that desire in you,

1484
01:34:13,299 --> 01:34:15,534
You'll get courage -the courage to live!

1485
01:34:19,299 --> 01:34:19,699
See you then!

1486
01:34:24,032 --> 01:34:25,500
He'll definitely ask fortrouble!

1487
01:34:25,699 --> 01:34:27,567
lfnot, we'll surely put him in trouble!

1488
01:34:40,699 --> 01:34:42,100
We study Economics because,

1489
01:34:43,265 --> 01:34:45,567
there's scarcity of many goods we want.

1490
01:34:46,366 --> 01:34:48,701
This problem is commonto Individuals,

1491
01:34:49,466 --> 01:34:50,366
well as the State

1492
01:34:51,466 --> 01:34:55,536
That's why we say Economics
is the Science of Scarcity.

1493
01:34:57,532 --> 01:34:59,767
And Scarcity is a basicfactorofour life.

1494
01:35:03,766 --> 01:35:05,400
Why did you changeyourlineto Education?

1495
01:35:05,799 --> 01:35:07,167
lt's my grandpa's College!

1496
01:35:07,432 --> 01:35:09,167
Thatwas my ideato build Engineering College
adjacentto this.

1497
01:35:09,599 --> 01:35:11,500
There's good business possibility in Kerala.

1498
01:35:14,499 --> 01:35:15,600
ltwasn't astough as l thought!

1499
01:35:16,399 --> 01:35:17,366
l memorized and taught them!

1500
01:35:17,632 --> 01:35:18,599
_ot sure whether the students understood

1501
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:20,534
Sowhat?You still have time to improve!

1502
01:35:20,766 --> 01:35:21,633
lt was onlyyourfirst class

1503
01:35:22,232 --> 01:35:23,700
So are you continuing here?

1504
01:35:25,566 --> 01:35:26,400
Why do you gaze at me?

1505
01:35:28,733 --> 01:35:30,201
Great!! Vey good!

1506
01:35:32,432 --> 01:35:34,500
Such out4f-theway appointments
are allowed nowadays?

1507
01:35:35,065 --> 01:35:36,399
Forthetime being,
Guest lecture post is enough!

1508
01:35:36,699 --> 01:35:38,067
Laterwe can think!

1509
01:35:38,566 --> 01:35:39,466
l don't need any post.

1510
01:35:39,799 --> 01:35:42,001
ljustwantto spend more time here,

1511
01:35:42,332 --> 01:35:43,366
as l feel happyto see these students.

1512
01:35:44,499 --> 01:35:45,066
Let's go!

1513
01:35:46,366 --> 01:35:48,434
-Are you guys in ahury?
- _o, not really.

1514
01:35:49,566 --> 01:35:51,701
College canteen is veynear.

1515
01:35:52,132 --> 01:35:55,668
We can relish yummysnacks
and tea of Kumarettan

1516
01:35:56,199 --> 01:35:56,666
Shall we go?

1517
01:35:57,132 --> 01:35:58,700
He has never had teasince 20 yrs,

1518
01:35:59,299 --> 01:35:59,666
and is he going to have now?

1519
01:36:00,099 --> 01:36:00,532
Why not a change?

1520
01:36:00,733 --> 01:36:01,433
Let me also have atea!

1521
01:36:03,366 --> 01:36:04,667
You're lucky!! She's really great!

1522
01:36:12,399 --> 01:36:14,367
l had takenVada (snack)
while l was in College.

1523
01:36:14,699 --> 01:36:15,499
Yeah, l know

1524
01:36:21,699 --> 01:36:26,336
l came humming a song this way,

1525
01:36:26,632 --> 01:36:31,503
When the branches of midnight blossomed,

1526
01:36:34,699 --> 01:36:38,002
mll you sing with me?

1527
01:36:40,165 --> 01:36:43,401
mll you sing with me?

1528
01:36:57,165 --> 01:36:58,132
l'll serve food!

1529
01:37:08,332 --> 01:37:09,399
ln the guise offinance company,

1530
01:37:09,632 --> 01:37:12,101
we malayalees come across many
fraudulent cases in histoy

1531
01:37:12,432 --> 01:37:13,666
Give 5 and take 10...

1532
01:37:14,065 --> 01:37:15,633
Avail loan for100 O/o gold value!

1533
01:37:16,065 --> 01:37:19,968
Companies who deceive people
offering such alluring promises,

1534
01:37:20,132 --> 01:37:21,099
might be the last link of
such companies,

1535
01:37:21,332 --> 01:37:23,300
suspicion grows stronger
aboutAnand Finance

1536
01:37:24,132 --> 01:37:26,300
A flnance company can't
sustain longer,

1537
01:37:26,499 --> 01:37:29,969
by giving huge offers to
attnctthe investors.

1538
01:37:30,132 --> 01:37:31,399
Like in histoy,

1539
01:37:31,599 --> 01:37:34,034
A veyfew early Investon
will get profit shares,

1540
01:37:34,332 --> 01:37:38,102
and they flee away after cheating
the majority of the depositors.

1541
01:37:38,299 --> 01:37:41,301
There are strong doubts about these
types offinance company.

1542
01:37:41,499 --> 01:37:44,268
Mr.PK Venugopal owns this company

1543
01:37:44,799 --> 01:37:46,734
This company started in the
name of his only son.

1544
01:37:47,132 --> 01:37:48,466
After his son's suicide,

1545
01:37:48,666 --> 01:37:51,035
this companywas onthe
verge ofshutting down.

1546
01:37:51,132 --> 01:37:54,235
From there, this company
comes back unbelievably,

1547
01:37:55,099 --> 01:37:58,335
afterthe demise ofhis son,
Mr.Venugopal's mental illness,

1548
01:37:58,566 --> 01:38:02,236
created more doubts for
stronger arguments

1549
01:38:18,566 --> 01:38:21,468
Hello...Yes Anand Finance!

1550
01:38:22,265 --> 01:38:24,333

Let me discuss itwith Sir.

Please come...at any time.

1556
01:38:33,199 --> 01:38:35,000
Your ornaments are safe here!

1557
01:38:36,532 --> 01:38:38,200
There's no one to cheat anyone here!

1558
01:38:40,532 --> 01:38:42,567
Venu, this iswhat l told you!

1559
01:38:43,265 --> 01:38:44,299
Useless people!

1560
01:38:45,099 --> 01:38:48,635

01:38:50,332 --> 01:38:52,233
An_aywe're with you!

1562
01:38:52,599 --> 01:38:54,267
Came to tell that only!

1563
01:38:55,799 --> 01:38:58,401
We can play agame against
the Channel, ifneeded?

1564
01:38:59,099 --> 01:39:00,633
At present they're thejudiciay!

1565
01:39:01,199 --> 01:39:02,500
Just give aword!

1566
01:39:03,199 --> 01:39:07,303
Heartless ones even say
that he committed suicide!

1567
01:39:07,799 --> 01:39:08,633
_ot necessay!!

1568
01:39:09,199 --> 01:39:10,633
Whatyou did so far is
morethan adequate!!

1569
01:39:12,165 --> 01:39:13,232
Could sense a mockey in that remark!

1570
01:39:13,599 --> 01:39:14,733
Why did you saylikethat?

1571
01:39:15,165 --> 01:39:18,101
People are coming in heaps!

1572
01:39:19,766 --> 01:39:21,400
lt seems theywant their gold now itself!

1573
01:39:23,532 --> 01:39:24,733
Settle eveybody!

1574
01:39:25,499 --> 01:39:27,367
Tell me in advance
how much fund is required!

1575
01:39:29,766 --> 01:39:32,502
_one should utter ahanhword
against myson!

1576
01:39:32,699 --> 01:39:33,266
Got it?

1577
01:39:36,165 --> 01:39:38,700
Let's settle and shut down.

1578
01:39:39,165 --> 01:39:40,099
lnfonn eveyone.

1579
01:39:40,766 --> 01:39:41,566
Letthem take it and enjoy!

1580
01:39:59,532 --> 01:40:01,033
What you showed is utter foolishness!

1581
01:40:01,466 --> 01:40:03,701
mnding up will onlytrigger suspicion!

1582
01:40:04,265 --> 01:40:05,699
But l'm not cheating anyone!

1583
01:40:06,165 --> 01:40:07,566
l'll settle evey single penny!

1584
01:40:07,733 --> 01:40:09,101
l have 100 times morewealth than that.

1585
01:40:09,366 --> 01:40:13,269
lnstead of convincing people,
why do you give up?

1586
01:40:14,265 --> 01:40:15,232
l lost already!

1587
01:40:15,466 --> 01:40:16,133
What more to lose beyondthis?

1588
01:40:17,432 --> 01:40:20,368
lt'll be wrong ifl tyto help others!

1589
01:40:21,466 --> 01:40:23,100
l tried helping myself,

1590
01:40:24,099 --> 01:40:24,699
to withstand..

1591
01:40:25,132 --> 01:40:25,465
..to live!

1592
01:40:26,132 --> 01:40:27,266
lt's over!!! That's enough!!

1593
01:40:28,265 --> 01:40:30,033
Don'tyou'vethe post mortem report?

1594
01:40:30,532 --> 01:40:31,399
lt's not a Suicide!

1595
01:40:32,332 --> 01:40:33,332
lt's just a paper!!

1596
01:40:33,733 --> 01:40:34,633
ltwas a murder....

1597
01:40:35,065 --> 01:40:35,665
Both ofus killed him!

1598
01:40:37,399 --> 01:40:38,366
When l think aboutthat...

1599
01:40:39,032 --> 01:40:42,602
Cricket, Karate, Medicine,
Music, Dance, Swimming..

1600
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,602
Myson danced like a doll to ourtunes!

1601
01:40:49,466 --> 01:40:51,367
l enfoRed all my desires on my son.

1602
01:40:53,332 --> 01:40:54,332
Actually that wasn't affection,

1603
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:55,633
but selflshness!

1604
01:40:56,032 --> 01:40:56,665
Goddammit!

1605
01:40:57,065 --> 01:40:58,266
Self realization, only now?

1606
01:40:58,699 --> 01:40:59,733
Yes Father, that isthe fact!

1607
01:41:00,265 --> 01:41:03,434
_o...l meet many children and parents.

1608
01:41:04,099 --> 01:41:07,101
You know veywell that
l'm nottelling this to comfortyou.

1609
01:41:09,399 --> 01:41:12,001
You keep saying that
he likes what you're doing now, right?

1610
01:41:12,466 --> 01:41:13,667
_ow why this disappointment?

1611
01:41:14,466 --> 01:41:15,366
l'm tired!

1612
01:41:16,332 --> 01:41:18,434
l lost out my mind to flght againstthem!

1613
01:41:18,666 --> 01:41:19,233
Eveything is finished!

1614
01:41:19,666 --> 01:41:20,400
Just sit inside..

1615
01:41:20,632 --> 01:41:22,467
..locking up the house from outside!!

1616
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:23,600
What bothers me?

1617
01:41:24,399 --> 01:41:25,233
l'm leaving,

1618
01:41:27,032 --> 01:41:28,066
but remember one thing!

1619
01:41:28,666 --> 01:41:29,500
lfyou do so,

1620
01:41:30,032 --> 01:41:32,267
then that'll be the grave mistake
you're doing to your son.

1621
01:41:34,399 --> 01:41:36,000
You just said, you weren't
able to showjustice,

1622
01:41:36,232 --> 01:41:37,032
to his actions when hewas alive!

1623
01:41:37,466 --> 01:41:39,100
Even if it's right,

1624
01:41:39,432 --> 01:41:42,134
at least show somejustice to his death!!

1625
01:41:42,432 --> 01:41:43,332
He deserves it!!

1626
01:41:45,799 --> 01:41:47,300
lfyou accept defeat now,

1627
01:41:47,599 --> 01:41:49,500
then their allegations will become true!

1628
01:41:50,099 --> 01:41:52,434
Perhaps, later on nobody can rectify it.

1629
01:41:53,299 --> 01:41:55,300
lsthiswhat you wish to do foryourson?

1630
01:41:55,632 --> 01:41:56,466
Then go ahead!

1631
01:41:57,432 --> 01:41:58,332
l'm leaving.

1632
01:41:59,632 --> 01:42:00,199
Father!!

1633
01:42:00,432 --> 01:42:02,400
Myjob is notto chantVedas
intothis buffalo's ear!!

1634
01:42:02,632 --> 01:42:05,334
_obody can impede the one
who decided to ruin himself!

1635
01:42:05,632 --> 01:42:06,566
Get ruined!

1636
01:42:17,165 --> 01:42:17,765
To prove the genuinity of our company,

1637
01:42:18,232 --> 01:42:20,100
we do hold the necessay documents.

1638
01:42:20,632 --> 01:42:21,599
Then why do you wory?

1639
01:42:49,199 --> 01:42:49,732
l'm waiting here for sometime.

1640
01:42:51,366 --> 01:42:53,668
Only yesterday,
l leamt ofthe issue here.

1641
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:56,201
That's okay.

You are doing many good deeds here!

1646
01:43:25,733 --> 01:43:27,534
Aswe exposed this news,

1647
01:43:27,766 --> 01:43:32,504
lt's the responsibility of a media
to scrutinize both the sides!

1648
01:43:32,766 --> 01:43:35,535
Yesterday, we reported of
Anand Finance scam.

1649
01:43:35,766 --> 01:43:37,400
To provethe innocence ofthe
opposite side,

1650
01:43:37,766 --> 01:43:40,668
Anand Finance's proprietor himself
is joining with us on this Live show.

1651
01:43:41,199 --> 01:43:42,366
Greetings MrVenugopall!

1652
01:43:44,299 --> 01:43:45,466
Please tell me Mr.Venugopal,

1653
01:43:45,733 --> 01:43:48,302
ls it possible for anyfinance company
in Keralato do business,

1654
01:43:48,499 --> 01:43:50,400
at such a low nte ofinterest?

1655
01:43:51,165 --> 01:43:54,301
l've evident documents of
all the transactions of last 6 months.

1656
01:43:54,566 --> 01:43:55,533
You can examine them!

1657
01:43:58,299 --> 01:44:00,434
Venugopal, It'll be better
if you explain it.

1658
01:44:01,265 --> 01:44:03,500
When seeing a penon or
their company ruining,

1659
01:44:03,666 --> 01:44:05,200
J
l too felt excited earlier

1660
01:44:07,199 --> 01:44:08,433
until my son's death!

1661
01:44:10,733 --> 01:44:12,468
Whateveryou see in those
documents are, merely accounts.

1662
01:44:12,699 --> 01:44:14,033
There isn't anytruth beyond this!

1663
01:44:17,265 --> 01:44:18,499
As you reported yesterday,

1664
01:44:18,733 --> 01:44:20,501
my son didn't commit suicide.

1665
01:44:21,099 --> 01:44:22,700
He died of Cardiac amest.

1666
01:44:23,733 --> 01:44:25,234
This is his post mortem report.

1667
01:44:27,065 --> 01:44:28,232
You can verifythistoo!

1668
01:44:31,532 --> 01:44:35,769
These are the records ofthe document
regarding the transfer,

1669
01:44:36,366 --> 01:44:37,233
ofme and myfamily memben document,
to the company.

1670
01:44:38,032 --> 01:44:41,168
These properties worth manifold
than the Depositon.

1671
01:44:41,632 --> 01:44:42,399
You can verifythese too!

1672
01:44:45,199 --> 01:44:46,400
l don't needto deceive anybody.

1673
01:44:48,199 --> 01:44:49,300
As you mentioned yesterday,

1674
01:44:49,466 --> 01:44:50,266
l am not going toflee away.

1675
01:44:51,232 --> 01:44:53,334
When you examine it, you'll undentand.

1676
01:44:54,032 --> 01:44:54,699
lt's a business !!!

1677
01:44:55,299 --> 01:44:57,000
J
We can do such business in our State

1678
01:45:00,265 --> 01:45:01,599
But people like you should co-operate.

1679
01:45:04,699 --> 01:45:06,600
Mr.Venugopal, l think you've mistaken us!

1680
01:45:09,032 --> 01:45:12,268
My son was betrayed....by his poor heart!

1681
01:45:15,032 --> 01:45:17,200
To you and all the viewers
who arewatching this,

1682
01:45:17,499 --> 01:45:19,434
l onlywant to say one thing.

1683
01:45:22,733 --> 01:45:24,968
To understand what l have done...

1684
01:45:25,232 --> 01:45:26,199
andwhy l have done...

1685
01:45:26,699 --> 01:45:29,968
Please show mercyto have abroad mind
to undentandthis.

1686
01:45:34,466 --> 01:45:35,366
That's all!

1687
01:45:48,199 --> 01:45:49,133
Even ifitwas a local channel,

1688
01:45:49,466 --> 01:45:52,101
T.V media is a double-edged sword!

1689
01:45:52,699 --> 01:45:55,001
Even ifit's a channel,
shared byyou few people,

1690
01:45:55,299 --> 01:45:57,167
you should not have
committed such amistake.

1691
01:45:57,632 --> 01:45:59,633
_ow the entire people, supports Venu.

1692
01:46:00,599 --> 01:46:03,268
By tnnsfeming his entire properties
on Company's name,

1693
01:46:03,599 --> 01:46:05,667
thus he proved his point to people!

1694
01:46:08,532 --> 01:46:09,399
ln such a dire circumstance,

1695
01:46:09,566 --> 01:46:13,536
did anybody expect Venu
would approach a media?

1696
01:46:14,766 --> 01:46:17,735
Whatever it's,
Iet's flnd a solution for it,

1697
01:46:18,599 --> 01:46:19,599
as early as possible.

1698
01:46:20,199 --> 01:46:23,268
This is notthe duty of a
Labour 8Welfare Ministerof Kerala.

1699
01:46:23,566 --> 01:46:25,534
Please tyto undentand my position also.

1700
01:46:26,165 --> 01:46:27,366
For this nte of interest,

1701
01:46:27,632 --> 01:46:30,201
Venu provedthat one can
run a profitablefinance company.

1702
01:46:30,666 --> 01:46:32,401
lsn_ that really an eye4pener?

1703
01:46:32,632 --> 01:46:33,366
That's not necessay!

1704
01:46:34,666 --> 01:46:37,602
Let me see whetherl can do
anything from this Ministy,

1705
01:46:38,032 --> 01:46:40,501
without your help.

1706
01:46:42,099 --> 01:46:44,067
Please don't take my words seriously.

1707
01:46:46,099 --> 01:46:47,200
l'm with you!

1708
01:46:48,632 --> 01:46:49,632
At tomorrow morning, 10 a.m,

1709
01:46:50,332 --> 01:46:52,067
l've planned fora
compromise meeting at Guest house!

1710
01:46:52,632 --> 01:46:53,966
Let me talkto Venu!

1711
01:46:54,399 --> 01:46:54,966
What doyou say?

1712
01:46:57,099 --> 01:46:59,167
l would've surely made a
settlementto this issue.

1713
01:47:01,099 --> 01:47:02,366
Cheer up man!

1714
01:47:16,733 --> 01:47:19,302
To be honest, l reallyhonouryou, Venu!

1715
01:47:20,165 --> 01:47:24,102
You really sparked a revolution in
Private flnance sector.

1716
01:47:25,232 --> 01:47:26,533
Mysonwas born today,

1717
01:47:27,132 --> 01:47:28,399
thus l promised to be at home at noon.

1718
01:47:29,366 --> 01:47:31,067
Even l cometo the point.

1719
01:47:31,366 --> 01:47:32,333
With all due respect,

1720
01:47:33,366 --> 01:47:35,167
whatthe real problem is,

1721
01:47:35,366 --> 01:47:37,234
you've upset the balance ofthe tnde!

1722
01:47:37,566 --> 01:47:39,734
lgnoring an existing system,

1723
01:47:40,232 --> 01:47:42,200
can any independent individual succeed?

1724
01:47:42,566 --> 01:47:43,300
_ot possible!!

1725
01:47:44,099 --> 01:47:45,133
ltwill only end up intragedy!

1726
01:47:45,632 --> 01:47:46,666
What do you expectfrom me?

1727
01:47:48,099 --> 01:47:50,534
The interest Scheme which
Anand Finance has put forward,

1728
01:47:50,733 --> 01:47:52,468
needs a major modiflcation!

1729
01:47:53,366 --> 01:47:54,667
Letthe things come back
to the nonnalcy.

1730
01:47:56,099 --> 01:47:58,301
Thatwasthe reason l told Peterettan,

1731
01:47:58,566 --> 01:48:00,134
that this meeting doesn't
need anybody else!

1732
01:48:01,065 --> 01:48:02,633
As there's no point ofsuch
unnecessaydiscussion,

1733
01:48:03,499 --> 01:48:05,467
let's solve this issue smoothly.

1734
01:48:06,599 --> 01:48:09,501
l don't undentandwhy a
person like you intrudes in this?

1735
01:48:11,065 --> 01:48:12,166
Am l doing anythingwrong?

1736
01:48:12,599 --> 01:48:13,566
l never say so.

1737
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:15,668
But, othen should also do their business.

1738
01:48:16,065 --> 01:48:17,099
Let them also survive!

1739
01:48:17,733 --> 01:48:21,470
When Govt. has taken
intensified actions against Blade Mafia,

1740
01:48:21,766 --> 01:48:23,300
is itjustiflable foryou to talkthisway?

1741
01:48:24,332 --> 01:48:26,133
Don_ be smart enough!

1742
01:48:26,733 --> 01:48:28,101
Justfora profit ofmere 10 rs,

1743
01:48:28,265 --> 01:48:30,166
you've done beyond these, in the past!

1744
01:48:32,432 --> 01:48:34,000
Can l leave ifyou've nothing else to say?

1745
01:48:34,499 --> 01:48:36,567
There'll be a protest before
your company on the 4'th day,

1746
01:48:38,332 --> 01:48:39,166
Do you wish to see?

1747
01:48:39,733 --> 01:48:42,268
l'll seal yourcompany, mind you!

1748
01:48:42,632 --> 01:48:44,533
But l have no workers in mycompany.

1749
01:48:45,299 --> 01:48:48,068
All my worken are entitled for
equal share in profit!

1750
01:48:49,032 --> 01:48:50,500
That's how l amendedthe
by-law ofmy company!

1751
01:48:51,099 --> 01:48:52,266
l don't want anything.

1752
01:48:52,499 --> 01:48:54,400
ljustwant my companyto run,
that's it!

1753
01:48:56,032 --> 01:48:57,266
You'll surely suffer, Venu!

1754
01:48:58,065 --> 01:48:59,332
Don't create any trouble, sir!

1755
01:48:59,766 --> 01:49:00,967
l've decided to cary itforward

1756
01:49:02,299 --> 01:49:04,134
You mighttyto impedethis,

1757
01:49:04,699 --> 01:49:06,200
still you'll not succeed!

1758
01:49:07,065 --> 01:49:08,766
Because thetruth prevails in me!!

1759
01:49:22,332 --> 01:49:27,470
The sound ofdark clouds
flapping theirwings,

1760
01:49:31,399 --> 01:49:37,171
the sound ofwaterdrops
falling on the leaves,

1761
01:49:40,499 --> 01:49:45,237
Far away, someone has opened,

1762
01:49:45,432 --> 01:49:48,401
thewindow ofthe sky.

1763
01:49:49,699 --> 01:49:57,239
Rain has comethis way
to awaken bya caress.

1764
01:50:17,366 --> 01:50:20,168
Love and separation,

1765
01:50:20,399 --> 01:50:24,503
have written a poem, on the nature's wall.

1766
01:50:35,432 --> 01:50:43,373
Know nin, at mybowl ofheart,

1767
01:50:43,599 --> 01:50:47,102
is stretching forthe elation
which you can only give.

1768
01:50:49,199 --> 01:50:54,137
the sound ofdark clouds
flapping theirwings,

1769
01:50:58,399 --> 01:51:03,604
the sound ofwaterdrops
falling on the leaves,

1770
01:51:32,466 --> 01:51:35,402
though spring has come manytimes,

1771
01:51:35,632 --> 01:51:38,001
in these paths, some flowerstill now,

1772
01:51:41,499 --> 01:51:45,736
reluctantto bloom, in the veil.

1773
01:51:46,132 --> 01:51:49,268
Remained on the hills, the murmurof
thoseflowen blooming.

1774
01:51:50,699 --> 01:51:59,374
Rain, showertothe soul which is,

1775
01:51:59,566 --> 01:52:02,502
listening with hope, lots ofjoy.

1776
01:52:22,132 --> 01:52:24,667
Great disaster triggered in his own life,

1777
01:52:25,099 --> 01:52:27,267
was tumed into agreat successful stoy,

1778
01:52:27,532 --> 01:52:28,232
That's Mr.Venugopal.

1779
01:52:29,299 --> 01:52:30,733
through this, he himselfbecame a light,

1780
01:52:31,265 --> 01:52:33,266
to manypeople around him,

1781
01:52:33,432 --> 01:52:34,599
A rare Charisma!

1782
01:52:35,265 --> 01:52:38,635
Out of these 6 persons, it's you, the viewers,

1783
01:52:39,065 --> 01:52:39,765
who have to flnd outthe _ewsmaker ofthisYear!

1784
01:52:40,299 --> 01:52:41,233
All the best, Venu!

1785
01:52:43,432 --> 01:52:48,370
The sound ofdark clouds
flapping theirwings,

1786
01:52:52,466 --> 01:52:58,171
the sound ofwaterdrops
falling on the leaves,

1787
01:53:01,632 --> 01:53:10,040
Far away, someone has opened
the window of the sky,

1788
01:53:11,099 --> 01:53:19,640
Rain has comethis way
to awaken bya caress.

1789
01:53:35,065 --> 01:53:35,498
Oh my son!!!

1790
01:53:37,065 --> 01:53:37,498
Oh myVenuetta!

1791
01:53:41,366 --> 01:53:42,200
What has happened to you son?

1792
01:53:43,065 --> 01:53:44,032
Open your eyes!

1793
01:53:44,599 --> 01:53:45,232
What has happened to you, Venuchetta?

1794
01:54:11,165 --> 01:54:12,132
ls it raining?

1795
01:54:15,699 --> 01:54:17,367
_othing to wory, you'll recover.

1796
01:54:18,265 --> 01:54:19,265
What's wrong with me?

1797
01:54:22,032 --> 01:54:23,400
Something serious which can't
be disclosed to me?

1798
01:54:27,265 --> 01:54:28,299
What's wrong with me, Jayshree?

1799
01:54:29,566 --> 01:54:31,100
Sir, you're not well!

1800
01:54:33,032 --> 01:54:34,733
Found multiple blocks in Angiogram!

1801
01:54:38,366 --> 01:54:41,068
ln one way, it's good thatwe diagnosed it now.

1802
01:54:42,032 --> 01:54:43,633
Varma sirwill be here foranotherweek.

1803
01:54:44,165 --> 01:54:46,233
Before he leaves, let's conduct
the Bypass surgey

1804
01:54:47,199 --> 01:54:47,732
One week?

1805
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:49,467
Please lie down!!

1806
01:54:50,199 --> 01:54:51,633
Don_ strain too much.

1807
01:54:52,199 --> 01:54:53,233
You require lot of rest.

1808
01:54:55,532 --> 01:54:59,168
l've not been hospitalized in my lifetime.

1809
01:55:02,332 --> 01:55:03,633
Only aweek remains now!!

1810
01:55:08,799 --> 01:55:09,699

1811
01:55:13,165 --> 01:55:14,132
Let'sty, sir!

1812
01:55:21,332 --> 01:55:22,466
So onlyoneweek!!!

1813
01:55:23,232 --> 01:55:24,099
lt's not meantthatway.

1814
01:55:27,766 --> 01:55:29,067
That's what our science says

1815
01:55:29,299 --> 01:55:30,299
ls there anypoint in arguing?

1816
01:55:30,766 --> 01:55:33,101
l've to go! l can'twaste mytime here.

1817
01:55:33,265 --> 01:55:34,232
What's this si_

1818
01:55:34,466 --> 01:55:36,067
-You're sick!! -l know...

1819
01:55:36,766 --> 01:55:37,733
_o more arguments regarding this!

1820
01:55:39,099 --> 01:55:40,500
As there's no surety of survival,

1821
01:55:40,699 --> 01:55:41,599
l'm not willingforthis surgey.

1822
01:55:42,132 --> 01:55:43,600
This is notthe right situationforthat.

1823
01:55:44,099 --> 01:55:45,733
l've plentyofthingsto do

1824
01:55:46,466 --> 01:55:48,067
Please listen to me, l'll not letyou go.

1825
01:55:48,299 --> 01:55:49,400
l don't need anybody's permission.

1826
01:55:50,099 --> 01:55:52,701
l will decide howto end my life.

1827
01:55:54,766 --> 01:55:57,068
Onlyforsuch one,
l survived these manydays.

1828
01:56:02,299 --> 01:56:04,034
lt'stime forme to reach myson.

1829
01:56:05,299 --> 01:56:07,567
That shouldn_ happen inside
this room with medicines.

1830
01:56:09,132 --> 01:56:09,699
lt must happen in my house,

1831
01:56:10,432 --> 01:56:11,966
lfpossible, in my son's room,

1832
01:56:12,733 --> 01:56:13,667
on his cot...

1833
01:56:15,165 --> 01:56:15,565
l must go!

1834
01:56:32,065 --> 01:56:33,299
Do you know, myfriends,

1835
01:56:34,065 --> 01:56:37,701
Right nowthere are more
than 10000 depositors inAnand Group

1836
01:56:38,132 --> 01:56:43,237
lt's their hard earned money,
which is in the name of his son!

1837
01:56:43,466 --> 01:56:47,670
...ln the name ofAnand Education Academy!

1838
01:56:48,099 --> 01:56:50,167
were Mr.Venugopal is goingto
spendthe money!

1839
01:56:50,699 --> 01:56:53,735
Shouldwe allowthis injustice to happen?

1840
01:56:55,699 --> 01:56:56,332
Being an ex MLA ofthis place,

1841
01:56:57,032 --> 01:56:58,133
J
and also an exNlinister

1842
01:56:59,032 --> 01:57:02,235
l'll fight forthis injustice
until my last breath!

1843
01:57:02,432 --> 01:57:04,667
Safe guarding the depositors is my duty!

1844
01:57:05,299 --> 01:57:09,036
l will never step back even
by an inch from this protest.

1845
01:57:12,699 --> 01:57:14,700
ls there any necessity
foryou to rush here?

1846
01:57:15,099 --> 01:57:15,732
Aren't we here?

1847
01:57:16,132 --> 01:57:17,032
Why did you stop work?

1848
01:57:17,566 --> 01:57:19,301
We don't have to bother
aboutthat paper_iger!

1849
01:57:19,799 --> 01:57:21,600
Don't woryyourself thinking ofthis.

1850
01:57:22,032 --> 01:57:24,267
You mean to say it'll get
settled ifl take rest!

1851
01:57:24,466 --> 01:57:25,600
We're running out oftime!
Let the workfunction!

1852
01:57:27,032 --> 01:57:30,001
l've flled a case againstthe members
ofthe Committee forprotection.

1853
01:57:31,065 --> 01:57:31,565
Advocate hadjust called me.

1854
01:57:34,065 --> 01:57:35,099
Askthem go to hell!

1855
01:57:35,666 --> 01:57:36,366
Bloody hell!!! Case!!

1856
01:57:37,399 --> 01:57:38,333
Don't stop the work!!

1857
01:57:38,566 --> 01:57:39,433
l don'twish to seethat.

1858
01:57:40,132 --> 01:57:40,966
Do you hear me, brother?

1859
01:57:43,366 --> 01:57:44,967
Things aren't as easy as you imagine!

1860
01:57:45,199 --> 01:57:47,067
Advocate said, stay order for
stopping Construction,

1861
01:57:47,299 --> 01:57:49,434
will be issued bythe Courtthis week .

1862
01:57:52,399 --> 01:57:53,633
Being Anand Trust Patron,

1863
01:57:54,065 --> 01:57:55,633
l've spoken to all concerned people.

1864
01:57:57,666 --> 01:57:58,700
lt's not the depositon
who are behind this plot,

1865
01:57:59,099 --> 01:58:01,367
but Peter and Satish!

1866
01:58:02,199 --> 01:58:04,034
Let me talk to them directly.

1867
01:58:04,399 --> 01:58:06,734
This type oflaunch should neverstop!

1868
01:58:07,632 --> 01:58:08,666
lfthis happens,

1869
01:58:09,065 --> 01:58:13,302
itwill beneflt all poorand
aspired children ofall times.

1870
01:58:13,499 --> 01:58:14,132
Dear, when did you come?

1871
01:58:15,099 --> 01:58:17,601
Oh my dear!!! Whyyou havethis misfortune!!

1872
01:58:18,733 --> 01:58:21,969
After offering a huge amount,
he purchased all my plots.

1873
01:58:22,632 --> 01:58:25,368
What a meRiless God!

1874
01:58:26,299 --> 01:58:28,300
lt's good you decided notto get operated

1875
01:58:28,566 --> 01:58:31,168
You don't have to sufferthat
pain also before death.

1876
01:58:31,366 --> 01:58:33,601
Hospital will also charge a hugefee!

1877
01:58:34,766 --> 01:58:38,035
Krishnakutty was also suffering
from similar illness,

1878
01:58:38,766 --> 01:58:41,468
he died aftervomiting blood inVellore.

1879
01:58:41,766 --> 01:58:43,067
Will you be quiet?

1880
01:58:44,733 --> 01:58:46,601
_o sense ofwhatto talk!!

1881
01:58:48,332 --> 01:58:49,433
You stay calm!!

1882
01:58:49,733 --> 01:58:51,401
Definitely, there'll be a way out.

1883
01:59:03,499 --> 01:59:04,600
We've an objection!

1884
01:59:05,232 --> 01:59:07,467
Our sweat is also behind
the gromh ofthis company.

1885
01:59:08,265 --> 01:59:11,501
Purchasing so much ofland
in a remote village itselfis ridiculous.

1886
01:59:12,132 --> 01:59:13,366
lt's onlythatwe didn't
express itthat day!

1887
01:59:14,132 --> 01:59:17,368
Do you think it's practical
to start an Educational Academy?

1888
01:59:17,766 --> 01:59:20,735
UniversityAffiliation itself
will involve lot offormalities.

1889
01:59:21,132 --> 01:59:22,132
ltwill all happen!!

1890
01:59:23,766 --> 01:59:24,666
We're just taking its first step.
That's all.

1891
01:59:25,499 --> 01:59:27,334
Let the institution come up fint.

1892
01:59:28,432 --> 01:59:30,700
There is no need for investors
to be in tension.

1893
01:59:31,466 --> 01:59:34,569
We are pumping a margin ofour
proflt in this project!

1894
01:59:36,499 --> 01:59:37,566
Anyone can verify it.

1895
01:59:40,466 --> 01:59:41,600
We've done this earlier also.

1896
01:59:42,499 --> 01:59:44,133
Whythis doubt now?

1897
01:59:44,499 --> 01:59:45,700
_ow things aren't like before.

1898
01:59:46,466 --> 01:59:47,700
AfterVenu sir, What next? Who next?

1899
01:59:49,165 --> 01:59:50,499
That's what we've to think immediately.

1900
01:59:51,065 --> 01:59:53,233
_obodyhas the righttotake
anydecisions on theirown.

1901
01:59:53,466 --> 01:59:54,700
As perby_aw, we should conduct election.

1902
01:59:55,265 --> 01:59:55,698
Let the election come.
_o one has that fear!

1903
01:59:56,733 --> 01:59:57,333
Stop it!

1904
02:00:11,232 --> 02:00:14,535
5 -6 yn back, after my son's demise

1905
02:00:15,432 --> 02:00:17,600
l remember comingto this offlce,

1906
02:00:19,366 --> 02:00:21,334
ARersending offthe existing 54 people here,

1907
02:00:22,699 --> 02:00:25,668
l came with the intention ofshutting down.

1908
02:00:29,099 --> 02:00:31,401
lfthis company could have
grown vastly from there,

1909
02:00:31,799 --> 02:00:34,768
Behind the gromh, it's the dream
like EducationAcademy!

1910
02:00:36,032 --> 02:00:37,266
lf not...

1911
02:00:37,466 --> 02:00:38,733
lf not, then this company
will be no more!

1912
02:00:39,432 --> 02:00:40,766
All that's good for speech only!

1913
02:00:41,232 --> 02:00:42,266
All ofus have an objection!

1914
02:00:42,499 --> 02:00:43,666
You must dothe operation!

1915
02:00:44,466 --> 02:00:46,401
Then, we'll have adeadline at least.

1916
02:00:47,299 --> 02:00:50,101
lnstead ifyou also die one day like your son,

1917
02:00:50,666 --> 02:00:53,335
Don_ forget some lives that are here.

1918
02:00:57,032 --> 02:00:58,166
Whetheryou do operation or not,

1919
02:00:58,399 --> 02:01:00,501
all ofus are aware that
there's no recoveyforit.

1920
02:01:03,132 --> 02:01:05,300
Thus do whateveryou could
as earlyas possible.

1921
02:01:06,032 --> 02:01:07,233
l've only have that much to saynow.

1922
02:01:36,099 --> 02:01:37,333
There's no point in accusing them.

1923
02:01:38,165 --> 02:01:40,267
Theyalso have the right
in Company's profit share.

1924
02:01:43,299 --> 02:01:45,601
Hearing is on 20th of next month.

Only last year, Aslam and family

Patient's mind will cure halfof his illness.

Can't you please rethink over it?

1950
02:04:34,699 --> 02:04:36,634
We werejusttalking ofyou, Venu.

1951
02:04:51,032 --> 02:04:52,733
Don't get offended, Venu.

1952
02:04:53,632 --> 02:04:56,601
When it is about people,
l will forgetfriendship.

1953
02:04:57,232 --> 02:04:58,666
lt's my responsibility to
back them up, right?

1954
02:05:01,632 --> 02:05:02,733
Mistake might have happened!

1955
02:05:03,666 --> 02:05:05,634
ln this regard, please don't

1956

Why do you talk this way, Venu?

1958
02:05:12,733 --> 02:05:15,235
You can take that as my lastwish
or anything you feel like.

1959
02:05:15,666 --> 02:05:17,434
That Institution has to come up
aRermy son's name.

1960
02:05:17,699 --> 02:05:20,435
lt's concerned of many
children's future, please.

1961
02:05:22,199 --> 02:05:25,268
What canwe do when the
issue is in the Court?

1962
02:05:25,733 --> 02:05:27,101
What foolishness!!

1963
02:05:27,666 --> 02:05:30,635
Time is the onlything that
is not inthe hands ofhuman being.

1964
02:05:31,199 --> 02:05:32,567
l'm in such aterrible condition now.

1965
02:05:33,432 --> 02:05:34,966

1967
02:05:38,299 --> 02:05:39,333
You should withdraw that case.

1968
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:41,034
Woh should resume.

1969
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:50,336
You just want only your
wishes to be fulfilled?

1970
02:05:50,566 --> 02:05:51,433
Don't we've children?

1971
02:05:51,632 --> 02:05:53,033
Don't they have to survive?

1972
02:05:55,032 --> 02:05:55,999
Tell me what l haveto do.

1973
02:05:56,432 --> 02:05:57,032

ln this situation don't, things
may get more worse aRer discussion.

1976
02:06:06,132 --> 02:06:08,767
What can we do ifpeople object?

1977
02:06:15,532 --> 02:06:17,734
That Institution will surely be there
aRer my son's name.

1978
02:06:19,632 --> 02:06:20,699
.... it is the placewhere he lies!

1979
02:06:24,399 --> 02:06:25,032
_o.

1980
02:06:28,699 --> 02:06:32,035
All these you see here
are built overmyson's death.

1981
02:06:32,265 --> 02:06:33,132
Don't you know that?

1982
02:06:34,632 --> 02:06:37,201
l'll not let even a
single penon to laya hand on it.

1983
02:07:06,499 --> 02:07:09,001
lt's difficult to have
inauguration on the _ew year.

1984
02:07:09,199 --> 02:07:11,100
Even the structural work is
not completed

1985
02:07:11,299 --> 02:07:12,533
Tyto speed up the woh.

1986
02:07:12,766 --> 02:07:14,467
Club's election is scheduled in MaRh.

1987
02:07:14,666 --> 02:07:17,568
Many straw men are there
to blow up my presidential post!

1988
02:07:20,366 --> 02:07:21,033
Peterettan, come here.

1989
02:07:27,366 --> 02:07:29,634
Kerala's biggest Private Finance Company,

1990
02:07:30,099 --> 02:07:31,033
Anand Finance is shutting down.

1991
02:07:31,265 --> 02:07:34,635
This decision may create a historic turn,

1992
02:07:35,032 --> 02:07:35,499
in the banking sector of Kerala.

1993
02:07:35,699 --> 02:07:37,434
Anand Finance Chairman PK Venugopal,

1994
02:07:37,599 --> 02:07:39,133
declaredthis decision to the
Mediathis morning,

1995
02:07:40,666 --> 02:07:41,633
l feel thatthis decision at atime when

1996
02:07:42,065 --> 02:07:44,000
Anand Finance is at a profltable
stage is relevant!

1997
02:07:45,232 --> 02:07:48,034
When there are many Financial Institutions
like _ationalised Bank,

1998
02:07:48,265 --> 02:07:50,000
Scheduled Bank and Co4perative Bank which
are under the Government's direct control,

1999
02:07:50,232 --> 02:07:52,701
what is the need forthis Private Institution,

2000
02:07:53,099 --> 02:07:57,303
which makes the people's life miserable
by collecting more interest !

2001
02:07:59,332 --> 02:08:03,469
lt's truethatwe tried to bring some
revolutionay changes in this sector.

2002
02:08:04,332 --> 02:08:07,401
But this will not happen if asingle
Company intends to purifythis sector

2003
02:08:08,099 --> 02:08:11,068
Thus l request all Private Finance
companies to shut down.

2004
02:08:12,065 --> 02:08:16,469
lnstead make the banking norms
more simple and transparent to the people...

2005
02:08:18,065 --> 02:08:20,967
As aChainnan ofAnand Finance,
using Veto Power,

2006
02:08:21,432 --> 02:08:23,133
l've the right to take all decisions.

2007
02:08:23,499 --> 02:08:26,134
Forthe employees and Investors
ofthe Anand Finance,

2008
02:08:26,499 --> 02:08:28,601
Profit share will reach all ofthem equally.

2009
02:08:29,499 --> 02:08:31,667
lfthe Govt. can ban on private lottey,

2010
02:08:32,299 --> 02:08:34,601
lfthis Govt. can ban the private bars...,

2011
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:37,769
Those who kill malayalees charging
exorbitant interest,

2012
02:08:38,165 --> 02:08:41,134
Whycan'tthey impose a ban on
Private Finance ?

2013
02:08:46,699 --> 02:08:49,568
More than 500 families committed suicide due,

2014
02:08:49,799 --> 02:08:51,300
to debt trapped by Private
Financing flrms last year.

2015
02:08:51,499 --> 02:08:53,734
l lost my house availing loan
from Manavallanfinance.

2016
02:08:54,132 --> 02:08:54,599
They have to befired down naked!

2017
02:08:55,265 --> 02:08:57,066
Regarding shut down offinance companies,

2018
02:08:57,232 --> 02:09:00,101
Mock flght between the opposition
and ruling parties in the parliament.

2019
02:09:44,366 --> 02:09:45,500
What isthisVenu?

2020
02:09:45,699 --> 02:09:48,201
You could've told me
ifthere was any problem.

2021
02:09:48,432 --> 02:09:50,200
l would've settled eveything.

2022
02:09:50,399 --> 02:09:52,200

First hold this.

2027
02:09:59,466 --> 02:10:02,535
lt's the court order regarding the
removal of stay order,

2028
02:10:02,766 --> 02:10:04,200
imposed on Anand Education Academy.

2029
02:10:04,566 --> 02:10:08,202
_ow you can set upAcademy
oranything you like!

2030
02:10:09,232 --> 02:10:10,466
Let the children get educated and grow.

2031
02:10:10,799 --> 02:10:11,766
Good, isn't it?

2032
02:10:12,766 --> 02:10:13,633

02:10:18,466 --> 02:10:20,100
That doesn_ matter.

2036

Anypoint in shutting down the
finns because ofthis?

2037
02:10:25,399 --> 02:10:27,634
Good running flrm, isn_ it?

2038
02:10:28,733 --> 02:10:30,634
As a returnfor my help,

2039
02:10:31,699 --> 02:10:34,001
you must retract from this decision.

A compromise!

2044
02:10:39,699 --> 02:10:41,634
As you have onefoot in the gnve,

2045
02:10:42,032 --> 02:10:42,665
You can do anything you like.
