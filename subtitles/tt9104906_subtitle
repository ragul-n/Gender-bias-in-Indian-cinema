00:00:56,937 --> 00:01:01,934
The truth that we understand by
closely observing the history is that

3
00:01:02,651 --> 00:01:06,035
There were more wars between
rich and poor rather than between

4
00:01:06,411 --> 00:01:09,380
different religions and castes.

5
00:01:09,742 --> 00:01:12,142
When the atrocities of the
masters reached intolerable peaks,

6
00:01:12,505 --> 00:01:15,408
a rebellion would be born in the
those communities that are oppressed.

7
00:01:15,496 --> 00:01:17,723
The masters would create a complete mayhem

8
00:01:18,167 --> 00:01:23,082
to suppress that rebellion.

9
00:01:23,633 --> 00:01:29,537
But nobody can stop any rebellion
which is meant to prevail justice.

10
00:01:30,108 --> 00:01:32,242
When the atrocities of
the masters becomes fire,

11
00:01:32,282 --> 00:01:35,362
the anger of the
oppressed become a volcano.

12
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,310
There would be a motivational story

13
00:01:38,514 --> 00:01:40,758
in every revolution that
took place in the world.

14
00:01:40,858 --> 00:01:41,858
Similarly,

15
00:01:42,423 --> 00:01:43,642
this is the love story
of the factual conflict

16
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:49,605
that took place few years ago near the
border of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka.

17
00:01:50,764 --> 00:01:52,324
The story of a revolution which started

18
00:01:52,771 --> 00:01:56,867
due to a girl named Geetha falling in love
with a guy named Bhairva is nothing but

19
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:58,978
Bhairava Geetha

20
00:02:04,689 --> 00:02:10,216
BHAIRAVA GEETHA

21
00:03:29,283 --> 00:03:30,283
Oh God!

22
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:36,850
Hey Bhairava,

23
00:03:36,933 --> 00:03:37,933
Wake up

24
00:03:38,058 --> 00:03:39,683
I told you we need to leave early

25
00:03:40,017 --> 00:03:42,100
It's already late, get up.

26
00:04:00,767 --> 00:04:01,558
What happened to your hand?

27
00:04:01,642 --> 00:04:05,017
Wooden splinter got stuck in my finger
while bringing wooden logs in the morning.

28
00:04:05,433 --> 00:04:06,892
Just like your father,

29
00:04:07,142 --> 00:04:08,975
blood is not a new thing for you

30
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:10,433
Eat quietly.

31
00:04:11,808 --> 00:04:13,448
Don't go to fetch
wooden logs from now on.

32
00:04:13,725 --> 00:04:15,183
Hmmm, well said.

33
00:04:15,725 --> 00:04:18,683
We both are used to bloodshed.

34
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:19,900
You eat

35
00:04:24,642 --> 00:04:26,183
Come soon as you finish your work

36
00:04:42,775 --> 00:04:44,340
- Flat tyre again?
- Yes

37
00:04:44,393 --> 00:04:45,593
Where have you been yesterday?

38
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,767
The new girl who came to sell liquor

39
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:52,433
She smiles and winks at me

40
00:04:53,017 --> 00:04:55,725
Been to enquire whether
it is love or infatuation.

41
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,300
Why are you staring like this?

42
00:04:58,892 --> 00:05:04,517
Men's life will be at stake
if it doesn't rain in the desert

43
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,350
Women spoil by hinting
Men spoil by not grasping it

44
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:10,642
You have no idea about love

45
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:15,011
and I am explaining this to you! Move on.

46
00:05:45,598 --> 00:05:46,598
Shall I cut you?

47
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,267
Who kept this here?

48
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,600
I did

49
00:06:15,725 --> 00:06:20,620
Last year same day, Chanmallappa's
men killed our men at Kumbalgudda

50
00:06:20,696 --> 00:06:21,696
So...

51
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:30,517
Who told you to worship
these son of witches slaves?

52
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:32,642
Throw this to the gutter

53
00:06:33,258 --> 00:06:34,258
Listen to me

54
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:36,500
Because they saved your life...

55
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:43,792
To whom else these slaves
sacrifice their lives other than me?

56
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,417
Just because this cock dies
for me in cock fight

57
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,750
You want me to worship this cock?

58
00:06:53,417 --> 00:06:59,125
I feed it, so that
it dies for me in the field

59
00:07:01,292 --> 00:07:03,875
Labours must be ill treated

60
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:08,458
Or else, these son of witches
demand equality

61
00:08:08,267 --> 00:08:09,392
Greetings, Balaramanna

62
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:13,783
Hey, Shankarappa

63
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:18,954
You should join hands with
the person who is elder

64
00:08:20,506 --> 00:08:22,745
and about to become your in-law

65
00:08:23,866 --> 00:08:27,560
should not face in the bet.

66
00:08:27,683 --> 00:08:29,617
Please don't mistake me, Balaramanna.

67
00:08:30,158 --> 00:08:30,742
This is a bet.

68
00:08:31,117 --> 00:08:32,709
This bet has a value,

69
00:08:33,185 --> 00:08:37,573
only when we fight with
a wise person like you.

70
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:39,625
Let's see.

71
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,367
Elder's say, we should always grow
a relationship with a reputed family.

72
00:09:49,783 --> 00:09:54,283
Where else my daughter can get
a reputed family other than your's?

73
00:09:55,658 --> 00:09:57,225
My wish to get my only daughter Geetha

74
00:09:57,713 --> 00:10:01,081
married to your son is
fulfilled with this bet.

75
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,033
There is no other wise family than yours.

76
00:10:07,117 --> 00:10:08,742
When is your daughter coming back?

77
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:11,356
She's coming home next week
as she's done with the studies

78
00:10:12,825 --> 00:10:13,825
Greetings, Balaramanna

79
00:10:14,617 --> 00:10:15,617
Greetings

80
00:10:21,575 --> 00:10:22,867
Why are you dull?

81
00:10:24,392 --> 00:10:25,451
Even after knowing everything

82
00:10:25,475 --> 00:10:27,933
you are getting Geetha married to Nanjamari

83
00:10:28,392 --> 00:10:30,767
Power is like a shadow on the wall

84
00:10:31,517 --> 00:10:35,642
Even if weak person, stand properly in
front of light, he looks like a super man

85
00:10:35,933 --> 00:10:38,225
If we are building a
relationship with Balaramappa,

86
00:10:39,183 --> 00:10:41,517
it means we we are standing
properly in front of light

87
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:45,933
Nanjamari is not light,
master. He is fire.

88
00:10:52,508 --> 00:10:55,092
They know nothing about you, master

89
00:10:58,217 --> 00:10:59,883
master, please don't.

90
00:11:00,175 --> 00:11:01,842
Master, please don't whip him.

91
00:11:02,042 --> 00:11:04,299
No, master...

92
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,133
He did not know what he was doing.

93
00:11:15,725 --> 00:11:19,383
Master, please don't beat

94
00:11:19,967 --> 00:11:23,300
I beg you, please don't beat

95
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:37,717
He did not know what he was doing
please spare him, master

96
00:11:38,008 --> 00:11:42,383
Will it not the fire burn you
if you touch it without knowing?

97
00:11:43,383 --> 00:11:44,383
It will burn

98
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:47,759
No, master...

99
00:12:47,175 --> 00:12:51,258
Fire can not understand your plead.

100
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:57,967
You should understand
how and where it burns

101
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:43,967
Please spare him, master...

102
00:14:05,792 --> 00:14:07,125
Open your eyes.

103
00:14:09,792 --> 00:14:10,792
Open your eyes.

104
00:14:12,883 --> 00:14:14,925
Don't think it ends by closing eyes.

105
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,417
If you are thinking like that,

106
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:21,250
it means that you don't
know about me properly.

107
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:24,792
Watch without blinking,

108
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:30,958
how that crow-bar
slowly pierces into his body.

109
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:34,542
Watch how it comes out
from his head at the end.

110
00:14:34,917 --> 00:14:39,750
I am killing him now because
your son fathered such a son.

111
00:14:41,675 --> 00:14:43,958
Will he die when it reaches intestine?

112
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:47,083
Will he die when it reaches chest?

113
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:50,333
Will he die when it reaches the skull?

114
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,708
You must watch it

115
00:14:55,192 --> 00:14:56,733
If you don't want that to happen,

116
00:14:59,308 --> 00:15:01,718
send your daughter-in-law tonight

117
00:15:03,638 --> 00:15:06,210
I will make her a fine girl and send back.

118
00:15:52,403 --> 00:15:53,403
Come in

119
00:16:19,617 --> 00:16:21,492
Go down and bring madam's luggage

120
00:16:21,742 --> 00:16:23,492
Let us bring the luggage, come

121
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:25,867
Let's go

122
00:16:26,424 --> 00:16:28,664
I would have brought them
on my own, if I had proper legs

123
00:16:39,183 --> 00:16:40,183
Had dinner?

124
00:16:40,825 --> 00:16:42,450
I was waiting for you, my son

125
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:55,658
I told you many times, not to wait
for me, but you don't listen

126
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:03,500
Have I ever had food with out you?

127
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:06,208
You please eat

128
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:08,167
Geetha is back

129
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:10,333
Got late due to shopping in town

130
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:11,875
Oh! Geetha came back?

131
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:14,542
How does she look like

132
00:17:14,792 --> 00:17:17,583
She looks like an educated girl

133
00:17:20,758 --> 00:17:23,542
Do not speak like this in front of Geetha

134
00:17:24,758 --> 00:17:26,417
Learn to speak properly

135
00:17:26,525 --> 00:17:29,611
I am what I am,
Why should I fake in front of her?

136
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:32,411
It's not like that

137
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:37,079
Rich men care about their
daughters more than their property

138
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,616
That's why I said

139
00:17:39,379 --> 00:17:41,700
Alright, leave it

140
00:17:45,917 --> 00:17:47,397
Geetha, you just came home yesterday.

141
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:48,917
Instead of resting,

142
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:51,167
you are ready to roam around!

143
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:54,875
Did I cam from so far, just to be at home?

144
00:17:56,292 --> 00:17:57,500
Hmmmm, in that case

145
00:17:57,922 --> 00:17:59,314
- Malla
- master

146
00:17:59,592 --> 00:18:02,175
Send few boys with her

147
00:18:02,342 --> 00:18:02,800
Okay master

148
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,508
No need of them.
I'll go alone.

149
00:18:05,258 --> 00:18:07,925
There is no need in town,
but here you need them

150
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:11,133
You are the daughter of Shakarappa.
You must take our men with you

151
00:18:24,433 --> 00:18:25,433
Geetha ma'am

152
00:18:26,017 --> 00:18:28,975
Bairappa on the hill
is a very powerful god

153
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:30,308
Yes

154
00:18:30,933 --> 00:18:34,558
Slicing three lemons on the steps

155
00:18:34,767 --> 00:18:35,933
apply Kumkum and turmeric

156
00:18:36,517 --> 00:18:37,683
Go round the boulder

157
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:38,892
place one on the trident

158
00:18:39,225 --> 00:18:40,683
My wish must be fulfilled

159
00:18:41,183 --> 00:18:44,183
or else you are not Bairappa at all

160
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:46,683
if you pray in this way,

161
00:18:47,142 --> 00:18:49,225
Your prayer will be answered

162
00:18:49,558 --> 00:18:51,183
I do not believe in God

163
00:18:52,267 --> 00:18:53,267
What did she say?

164
00:19:02,442 --> 00:19:05,067
O Bairappa, grant me a girl

165
00:19:05,358 --> 00:19:06,998
I don't mind,
even if she has no left hand

166
00:19:30,258 --> 00:19:31,258
What is that?

167
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:33,867
It is a very strange sound! Isn't it?

168
00:19:34,356 --> 00:19:35,787
Stop it.

169
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,667
It is the sound of dove.

170
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,167
It makes sound when it
sees anything strange.

171
00:19:40,783 --> 00:19:44,700
What did it see that made it
sound so strange like that?

172
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,200
Probably it's you.

173
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,500
Madam

174
00:20:04,283 --> 00:20:06,750
You are so surprised by dove sound,

175
00:20:07,075 --> 00:20:10,208
You will feel overwhelmed
when you see blackbucks

176
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:11,625
Blackbucks are there!

177
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,542
A lot of black bucks would
come and hop around here.

178
00:20:16,367 --> 00:20:17,833
Two eyes are not enough to see them.

179
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:19,458
Let's go there tomorrow

180
00:20:22,792 --> 00:20:23,975
Get up slowly,

181
00:20:24,308 --> 00:20:26,789
this is where the blackbucks come.

182
00:20:35,741 --> 00:20:37,453
I don't see any blackbuck

183
00:20:37,522 --> 00:20:38,522
Hey wait man...

184
00:20:40,497 --> 00:20:43,060
Be quite

185
00:20:57,717 --> 00:20:59,842
Blackbuck you said!
Where is it?

186
00:21:02,467 --> 00:21:05,467
Rama went in search of a deer
Ravan kidnapped Sita

187
00:21:06,217 --> 00:21:09,758
What if you go behind a deer
and someone kidnaps you?

188
00:21:10,467 --> 00:21:13,258
That is why deer is not showing up

189
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:17,008
You cripple!

190
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:20,592
If you keep fooling around
I'll break your another leg

191
00:21:20,725 --> 00:21:22,517
Not the second one, please!

192
00:21:23,808 --> 00:21:28,102
Will we keep quite, if someone
tries to kidnap Geetha ma'am?

193
00:21:28,262 --> 00:21:30,847
We will sacrifice them to Bairappa

194
00:21:51,158 --> 00:21:52,700
Is there no one in this village?

195
00:21:54,575 --> 00:21:55,815
Shanka, tell her what happened.

196
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:57,492
Don't know exactly what happened!

197
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,740
Don't know from they came!

198
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:04,556
They massacred
even children and aged people.

199
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
They torched the town.

200
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:10,533
The whole town turned to
cemetery before sunrise

201
00:22:11,992 --> 00:22:13,831
I feel goosebumps by imagining it.

202
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:19,395
Few people escaped with their children.

203
00:22:19,721 --> 00:22:22,834
All that is left is burnt walls
and memories of dead people

204
00:22:23,106 --> 00:22:28,213
That old lady stay here as a sole witness.

205
00:22:39,325 --> 00:22:40,325
Hey old lady,

206
00:22:40,742 --> 00:22:42,827
fruits don't fall for prayers.

207
00:22:43,425 --> 00:22:45,752
She is waiting for those flowers.

208
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,867
She worship in that abandoned temple

209
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:50,408
Hey Bhairava, pluck those flowers

210
00:23:08,417 --> 00:23:09,417
Geetha ma'am

211
00:23:10,075 --> 00:23:13,408
Old lady's son, daughter and
grandchildren were murdered that day

212
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,950
Her whole family got killed.

213
00:23:20,533 --> 00:23:22,742
What did you pray to God?

214
00:23:22,942 --> 00:23:26,538
I prayed to God to behead the one who
brought this situation to this village.

215
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:28,360
Hey old lady

216
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:32,783
Can't you just leave this place and
get settled in a neighbouring town?

217
00:23:33,325 --> 00:23:35,325
Even vengeance is aging.

218
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:39,200
Was I able to reach these
flowers ten minutes ago?

219
00:23:39,472 --> 00:23:41,239
Didn't your friend plucked
them and placed in my hands?

220
00:23:41,263 --> 00:23:45,232
Similarly, the head of the person
who brought havoc to this village

221
00:23:45,503 --> 00:23:46,503
would be in my hands.

222
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:51,891
Who is the person responsible for this?

223
00:23:53,323 --> 00:23:56,107
Who else? It is Shankarappa

224
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,658
He is hiding behind the
swords of hired slaves

225
00:23:59,808 --> 00:24:02,117
he is forgetting his death

226
00:24:03,159 --> 00:24:05,283
We should remind him of his death

227
00:24:05,533 --> 00:24:07,533
Is Shankarappa a child to get scared?

228
00:24:08,075 --> 00:24:09,950
We should take off those
swords in right time

229
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:15,200
Fear is stronger than swords, Jangaiah

230
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:18,350
Right opportunity should come

231
00:24:18,758 --> 00:24:20,496
Right opportunity should come

232
00:24:25,016 --> 00:24:29,148
Brother, the daughter of Subba Reddy
is wandering in the village hillocks.

233
00:24:40,909 --> 00:24:42,929
I have found a match for you

234
00:24:43,917 --> 00:24:44,917
His name is

235
00:24:45,458 --> 00:24:46,458
Nanjamari

236
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,851
Shall I once...

237
00:24:50,492 --> 00:24:55,992
You should only think of
what to study and wear

238
00:24:56,125 --> 00:24:58,325
I decide in marriage matter

239
00:24:58,692 --> 00:24:59,692
Just do what I say

240
00:25:02,992 --> 00:25:04,968
You told your mom that you want
to go to the town tomorrow

241
00:25:04,992 --> 00:25:06,783
Yes, I will go with our men

242
00:25:06,883 --> 00:25:12,845
Car stereo: "John Denver's
You filled up my senses song"

243
00:25:13,242 --> 00:25:15,492
Shanku, why you look dull?
Don't you like the song?

244
00:25:15,683 --> 00:25:19,183
What kind of a song?
He has a voice of of an ass

245
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:20,808
Hey, do you who the singer is?

246
00:25:21,242 --> 00:25:22,242
Whoever it may be!

247
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:25,950
They are nothing compared
to Bhairava's songs

248
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,158
Bhairava, you sing!?

249
00:25:31,667 --> 00:25:32,333
He sings so well

250
00:25:32,642 --> 00:25:37,283
The crops swing by listening to his songs

251
00:25:38,867 --> 00:25:39,867
Hey, sing now

252
00:25:46,483 --> 00:25:51,317
"You turn red
if you take bath in anthill"

253
00:25:52,983 --> 00:25:57,900
"You turn black
if you go with flock of crows"

254
00:25:59,533 --> 00:26:04,475
"You turn ghee
if you dip into silver"

255
00:26:06,058 --> 00:26:11,225
"Forgive me, I can't sing so well"

256
00:26:12,108 --> 00:26:15,408
"Oh clever horse!"

257
00:26:15,608 --> 00:26:18,525
"It is difficult to mount and get down.
It is a king's horse"

258
00:26:22,358 --> 00:26:27,442
"You turn red
if you take bath in anthill"

259
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:33,983
"You turn black if you
go with flock of crows"

260
00:27:01,108 --> 00:27:04,942
"Clothes to sell and clothes
to wear, you have granted"

261
00:27:07,358 --> 00:27:11,567
"Tie jingle to a bird
and fly it to the sky"

262
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:17,233
"Sami's wedding is a monkey's play"

263
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,567
"I sang irrelevant lines
you will say good bye to me"

264
00:27:20,667 --> 00:27:24,150
"Monkeys trouble in fair too,
I want nothing"

265
00:27:56,483 --> 00:28:00,650
"Shall we make the moon sell snacks?"

266
00:28:02,858 --> 00:28:07,067
"Let's play hopscotch with him"

267
00:28:09,442 --> 00:28:12,692
"Where did you to learn to smile,
O Channapattana doll?"

268
00:28:12,892 --> 00:28:15,908
"Sun feels thirsty seeing your smile"

269
00:28:16,092 --> 00:28:19,817
"Lake replaced the river
and canal replaced the lake"

270
00:28:19,983 --> 00:28:24,817
"You turn red
if you take bath in anthill"

271
00:28:26,525 --> 00:28:31,483
"You turn black
if you go with flock of crows"

272
00:28:33,067 --> 00:28:37,775
"You turn ghee
if you dip into silver"

273
00:28:39,608 --> 00:28:44,442
"Forgive me, I can't sing so well"

274
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:48,775
"Oh clever horse,"

275
00:28:49,025 --> 00:28:51,983
"It is difficult to mount and
get down. It is a king's horse"

276
00:28:55,900 --> 00:29:00,900
"You turn red
if you take bath in anthill"

277
00:29:02,442 --> 00:29:07,342
"You turn black
if you go with flock of crows"

278
00:31:04,713 --> 00:31:05,713
Ouch!

279
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:52,700
Probably, they are Kote Veerappa's men.

280
00:31:53,075 --> 00:31:54,700
There is no one left in his gang.

281
00:31:55,033 --> 00:31:57,033
We killed all their
men in the recent fair.

282
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:00,783
When they came to know
we are becoming in-laws to Balaramappa.

283
00:32:01,442 --> 00:32:03,783
Those cowards left
the village out of fear.

284
00:32:05,066 --> 00:32:07,992
Can it be Gowda's men
whom we killed in Mavingudda?

285
00:32:08,692 --> 00:32:10,567
His people are educated.

286
00:32:11,033 --> 00:32:13,473
The hand which holds a pen
wouldn't have guts to hold a sword.

287
00:32:13,583 --> 00:32:14,583
Who can it be?

288
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:18,762
Is it Rudrappa?
Channamallaiah or Changalraya?

289
00:32:19,083 --> 00:32:20,908
It's a shame, master

290
00:32:29,658 --> 00:32:30,700
What did you say?

291
00:32:31,408 --> 00:32:34,742
When our girl has been attacked

292
00:32:35,408 --> 00:32:39,867
we are just thinking about who did it,
instead of chopping heads

293
00:32:40,367 --> 00:32:42,158
is it not an insult, master?

294
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:46,867
If we catch hold of the one
who attacked my daughter,

295
00:32:48,308 --> 00:32:49,450
what should be done?

296
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:51,825
He should be burnt alive, master

297
00:32:52,217 --> 00:32:53,241
what if, not burnt?

298
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:57,970
People will think, Shankarappa is a coward

299
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:04,783
If people think that way,
will anyone fear me in this town?

300
00:33:05,158 --> 00:33:07,742
I swear on Geetha, master

301
00:33:12,617 --> 00:33:14,075
it means I am dead

302
00:33:19,033 --> 00:33:20,575
Get me petrol, Malla

303
00:33:30,617 --> 00:33:32,575
Why master?

304
00:33:46,658 --> 00:33:50,492
What did I do, master?

305
00:33:55,608 --> 00:33:59,908
Please don't, master!

306
00:34:01,992 --> 00:34:05,700
You told me to burn,
I am burning you see

307
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:28,575
One who attacks my
daughter should be burnt

308
00:34:39,408 --> 00:34:40,742
Why did you do this, master?

309
00:34:41,325 --> 00:34:44,367
How dare he touch my daughter?

310
00:34:45,617 --> 00:34:47,725
He is one among us, master

311
00:34:47,775 --> 00:34:52,783
Everyone must know this will happen
to the one who touch my daughter

312
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:58,325
Throw his body in city centre, saying
he was involved in yesterdays's attack

313
00:34:59,933 --> 00:35:03,583
If I don't do anything to the
people who attacked my daughter

314
00:35:03,783 --> 00:35:05,617
my reputation will be spoiled

315
00:35:06,533 --> 00:35:09,575
Find out who did it and slit their throats

316
00:35:10,458 --> 00:35:16,033
The attacker must realise
how big his mistake was

317
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,242
What happened?
Why are you bleeding?

318
00:35:21,125 --> 00:35:22,950
Some men tried to kill Geetha ma'am

319
00:35:23,358 --> 00:35:26,283
Oh God! Come, sit here.

320
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,125
Sit here.

321
00:35:41,733 --> 00:35:44,492
Didn't notice even
after blood got clot?

322
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:45,658
Geetha got hurt too

323
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:47,950
While protecting her

324
00:35:48,533 --> 00:35:50,450
People are there to take care of Geetha

325
00:35:51,625 --> 00:35:54,367
But did you forget that I have only you?

326
00:35:55,958 --> 00:35:58,700
You are the one who said
bloodshed is not new to us

327
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:00,250
then why do you cry?

328
00:36:00,292 --> 00:36:01,292
Shut up

329
00:36:02,133 --> 00:36:04,013
What if something bad had
happened to you today?

330
00:36:04,817 --> 00:36:06,242
What could have been my condition?

331
00:36:07,175 --> 00:36:08,950
Can't dare to imagine!

332
00:36:09,408 --> 00:36:10,408
Enough of all this.

333
00:36:10,525 --> 00:36:13,450
We don't need fighting and bloodsheds

334
00:36:14,333 --> 00:36:19,242
Your uncle is living peacefully
He is farming in neighbouring village

335
00:36:19,833 --> 00:36:23,658
Let us go there,
do farming and live peacefully

336
00:36:25,513 --> 00:36:26,513
No.

337
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:28,450
I walk my father's path,

338
00:36:29,183 --> 00:36:30,635
whether I take life or give life,

339
00:36:30,822 --> 00:36:32,102
it will be for only Shankarappa.

340
00:37:10,875 --> 00:37:12,033
- Geeth
- Yes.

341
00:37:13,283 --> 00:37:15,118
I told you to try that dress
for tomorrow's engagement.

342
00:37:15,142 --> 00:37:16,142
But, what are you doing?

343
00:37:16,375 --> 00:37:17,375
Mom,

344
00:37:17,458 --> 00:37:18,708
I don't like this engagement.

345
00:37:19,108 --> 00:37:19,542
What?

346
00:37:20,058 --> 00:37:21,475
I don't like this engagement.

347
00:37:21,892 --> 00:37:22,892
Everything is arranged

348
00:37:23,325 --> 00:37:26,142
Without any reason, how can you say
you don't like this engagement?

349
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,392
Did you think about
your father's reputation?

350
00:37:29,017 --> 00:37:32,058
People will gossip that
Shankarappa's daughter revolted

351
00:37:32,892 --> 00:37:36,017
Geetha,
reputation matters the most to your father

352
00:37:36,517 --> 00:37:37,683
Get ready instantly

353
00:38:16,083 --> 00:38:17,083
Water, master

354
00:38:51,283 --> 00:38:57,100
Control yourself
till the engagement gets over.

355
00:38:57,850 --> 00:38:59,391
You are free after that.

356
00:39:36,591 --> 00:39:39,232
She has an attractive frontal.

357
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:45,341
I am going mad thinking about her back.

358
00:40:02,866 --> 00:40:08,600
Groom Mr.Nanjamari
son of Balaramappa,

359
00:40:08,966 --> 00:40:12,558
Bride Ms.Geetha,
daughter of Mr. Shankarappa

360
00:40:12,925 --> 00:40:16,036
Engagement is about to
be conducted between them

361
00:40:25,133 --> 00:40:27,039
Engagement is duly performed, master

362
00:41:02,495 --> 00:41:03,846
Did I ask you?

363
00:41:05,222 --> 00:41:06,645
You bloody slave!

364
00:41:11,308 --> 00:41:12,308
Hey Nanjamari!

365
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,484
Nanjamari, leave her

366
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:19,046
Geetha, you go inside.

367
00:41:25,158 --> 00:41:26,803
She studied abroad

368
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:28,683
She is not aware of our customs.

369
00:41:29,225 --> 00:41:30,632
I pampered her, that's my mistake

370
00:41:31,016 --> 00:41:32,336
She slapped you out of ignorance,

371
00:41:32,558 --> 00:41:33,850
she will adopt after the wedding

372
00:41:35,183 --> 00:41:36,663
Please forget this matter right here.

373
00:42:14,966 --> 00:42:15,966
Start the vehicles

374
00:42:20,058 --> 00:42:21,058
Hey Geetha

375
00:42:21,225 --> 00:42:25,275
Is your brain working or did you
left it at the city while coming here?

376
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:28,094
Don't you know
how to behave with people?

377
00:42:28,931 --> 00:42:31,455
I did what I felt right, father.

378
00:42:31,537 --> 00:42:32,537
What is right?

379
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:36,094
To slap Mr Nanjamari
for the sake of that dog?

380
00:42:36,653 --> 00:42:40,641
He can't judge what is right
or wrong when he loses his mind.

381
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:42,141
He would just behead people.

382
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:47,313
He would have burned you
if he didn't respect me.

383
00:42:47,575 --> 00:42:48,575
Try to understand.

384
00:42:48,725 --> 00:42:49,725
Bhairava is one of us.

385
00:42:50,158 --> 00:42:52,766
He can sacrifice his life to save me.

386
00:42:53,212 --> 00:42:56,660
How can I keep quite, when such a
person is beaten for no reason?

387
00:42:56,819 --> 00:42:59,635
Even he knows to beat
without any reason.

388
00:42:59,916 --> 00:43:00,916
Reason?

389
00:43:01,266 --> 00:43:03,336
Nanjamari is your husband to be.

390
00:43:04,141 --> 00:43:07,183
He will pet the dogs if
he likes or kills them

391
00:43:07,808 --> 00:43:09,558
Those dogs are here for us

392
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:18,891
You are not a kid to make you understand
the difference between a king and a slave

393
00:43:19,041 --> 00:43:22,725
Instead of marrying an
unpredictable mad dog

394
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:28,225
it is better to marry loyal
and loving Bhairava, dad.

395
00:43:31,308 --> 00:43:32,455
Geetha

396
00:43:33,641 --> 00:43:35,850
You are crossing my line, Geetha.

397
00:43:36,625 --> 00:43:38,106
Those boundaries are for you, dad

398
00:43:57,908 --> 00:43:58,908
What happened, brother?

399
00:44:02,516 --> 00:44:05,391
My heart is burning like hell, Vishwa

400
00:44:06,266 --> 00:44:07,808
How dare she,

401
00:44:09,016 --> 00:44:13,850
raise hand to me in front of the crowd!

402
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,933
I am not able to bare it!

403
00:44:17,937 --> 00:44:19,416
I should do something to her.

404
00:44:20,383 --> 00:44:22,171
I must do something to her

405
00:44:29,278 --> 00:44:31,455
Can anything be spoken

406
00:44:32,571 --> 00:44:36,687
without any slightest
thought in the mind, Malla?

407
00:44:37,816 --> 00:44:38,816
It can't be, master.

408
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:44,668
Can that rebellious thought be killed?

409
00:44:46,033 --> 00:44:49,124
Only a thought can't be
avoided or killed, master.

410
00:44:50,633 --> 00:44:56,283
What do we do if we cannot kill the
person in whose mind the thought was born?

411
00:44:57,666 --> 00:45:02,799
It is enough we kill the person
about whom the thought is about.

412
00:45:06,966 --> 00:45:07,966
In that case,

413
00:45:08,975 --> 00:45:11,058
kill Bhairava

414
00:45:14,541 --> 00:45:15,708
Don't ask me anything.

415
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:17,550
Just do what I say.

416
00:45:19,585 --> 00:45:23,400
Make sure that the dead
body would be untraced.

417
00:45:33,733 --> 00:45:36,025
Follow orders without
any second thought.

418
00:45:37,208 --> 00:45:38,808
This is Shankarappa's order

419
00:45:40,925 --> 00:45:43,516
This job must be done before sunrise.

420
00:45:44,316 --> 00:45:49,025
Only the men who just blindly go for a
kill without any questions come with me.

421
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:55,183
It's not easy to stab the
person whom we work with.

422
00:45:56,258 --> 00:46:01,141
But remember, it is master Shankarappa
who is paying us for our living.

423
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:11,273
- Shanku! Why are you here late night?
- Bhairava

424
00:46:11,937 --> 00:46:12,353
Bhairava

425
00:46:12,651 --> 00:46:13,164
What happened?

426
00:46:13,335 --> 00:46:16,494
Run away from here as soon as possible

427
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:17,600
Are you drunk?

428
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:21,825
Shankarappa has
ordered Mallaiah to kill you

429
00:46:22,366 --> 00:46:24,450
He is on way with a gang.

430
00:46:24,783 --> 00:46:27,158
Run away, don't get caught.

431
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,160
Bhaira

432
00:46:29,441 --> 00:46:30,441
You must be hallucinated

433
00:46:30,916 --> 00:46:32,316
Why would Shankarappa want me dead?

434
00:46:32,616 --> 00:46:33,700
I don't know that.

435
00:46:34,116 --> 00:46:36,325
It is true that Mallaiah
is coming here to kill you.

436
00:46:36,616 --> 00:46:38,991
Enough, I'll go and
enquire Shankarappa now

437
00:46:40,075 --> 00:46:41,075
Try to understand.

438
00:46:41,825 --> 00:46:43,116
You will be dead

439
00:46:43,966 --> 00:46:47,640
Mother, make him understand.

440
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:48,866
Wait, I'll go and enquire.

441
00:46:49,897 --> 00:46:54,108
Bhairava, we don't need
reasons now. We need our life.

442
00:46:55,266 --> 00:46:56,381
He is a powerful man.

443
00:46:56,788 --> 00:47:00,908
Who knows what strikes in his mind?

444
00:47:01,950 --> 00:47:03,033
Listen to me

445
00:47:15,361 --> 00:47:17,304
Bloody, he escaped!

446
00:47:41,141 --> 00:47:42,141
Geetha ma'am

447
00:47:44,116 --> 00:47:45,116
Geetha ma'am

448
00:47:49,908 --> 00:47:51,700
What happened?
Why are you here at this time?

449
00:47:52,491 --> 00:47:56,783
Ma'am, master Shankarappa has
ordered Mallaiah to kill Bhairava.

450
00:47:58,158 --> 00:48:01,325
You must stop your father somehow.

451
00:48:01,835 --> 00:48:02,960
Where is Bhairava?

452
00:48:11,483 --> 00:48:15,001
Geetha ma'am is at Bairappa temple.
Come fast, she wants to talk to you.

453
00:48:15,433 --> 00:48:17,491
Mother, I'll go and
find what's the matter.

454
00:48:17,541 --> 00:48:19,189
You don't leave this place at any cost

455
00:48:19,366 --> 00:48:20,366
Take care, mom.

456
00:48:20,596 --> 00:48:21,177
Okay Bhairava.

457
00:48:21,249 --> 00:48:22,689
You don't worry about me.

458
00:48:22,849 --> 00:48:25,130
Cover yourself with this
blanket. You won't be recognised.

459
00:48:25,227 --> 00:48:28,243
- Let's go
- Be careful, my son

460
00:48:33,658 --> 00:48:36,450
Bhairava left the village
out fear I guess, master

461
00:48:37,241 --> 00:48:38,858
His mother is not home too.

462
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:43,158
Master, we searched for him everywhere.

463
00:48:45,246 --> 00:48:46,582
Geetha is missing.

464
00:48:50,266 --> 00:48:54,158
I want his dead body here by
morning no matter where he is hiding

465
00:48:55,250 --> 00:48:56,250
Go find him

466
00:48:57,933 --> 00:48:58,933
Malla

467
00:49:01,625 --> 00:49:05,944
No one should come to
know that Geetha is missing

468
00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:20,650
What's happening?

469
00:49:21,825 --> 00:49:25,108
I told my dad that I will marry you.

470
00:49:25,806 --> 00:49:28,104
Have you gone mad ma'am?

471
00:49:29,691 --> 00:49:32,553
What's your status and mine?
How could you say that?

472
00:49:32,717 --> 00:49:34,829
Because I believed that

473
00:49:35,068 --> 00:49:40,205
it is far better to marry
you than Nanjamari, Bhairava.

474
00:49:40,505 --> 00:49:41,875
You have really gone mad.

475
00:49:42,875 --> 00:49:43,995
How could you say like that?

476
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:48,397
Tell your dad that
you didn't mean it.

477
00:49:48,489 --> 00:49:50,077
I didn't come here
to go back, Bhairava

478
00:49:50,264 --> 00:49:53,713
If I go back, they will definitely
get me married to Nanjamari

479
00:49:55,081 --> 00:49:56,649
I'll not marry him at any cost

480
00:49:56,912 --> 00:49:58,656
Nanjamari belongs to a reputed family

481
00:49:59,143 --> 00:50:00,823
His dad is going to
be a minister in future

482
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:02,756
He is a billionaire.

483
00:50:04,466 --> 00:50:07,045
I know about them better than you

484
00:50:07,749 --> 00:50:09,970
you too know about Nanjamari

485
00:50:11,603 --> 00:50:13,080
If you were a father

486
00:50:13,247 --> 00:50:17,414
would you get your daughter married
to him for only money and wealth?

487
00:50:17,615 --> 00:50:18,894
Tell me Bhairava

488
00:50:19,334 --> 00:50:22,874
I'll jump and die if forced.

489
00:50:23,970 --> 00:50:25,321
But I will not go back.

490
00:50:26,095 --> 00:50:27,095
Bhaira

491
00:50:27,310 --> 00:50:28,310
Bhaira

492
00:50:29,654 --> 00:50:31,371
Shankarappa came to know somehow

493
00:50:31,562 --> 00:50:32,562
his men are on the way

494
00:50:33,302 --> 00:50:34,429
What are you thinking?

495
00:50:35,087 --> 00:50:37,191
Leave this place now, immediately

496
00:51:04,693 --> 00:51:09,756
Find him wherever he is and kill him.

497
00:51:31,335 --> 00:51:34,456
Master, we could not find them.

498
00:51:38,589 --> 00:51:42,133
I should not hear again
that they are missing.

499
00:51:59,924 --> 00:52:01,240
Our servant Bhairava

500
00:52:02,344 --> 00:52:06,119
took my daughter Geetha by force.

501
00:52:06,816 --> 00:52:09,441
Before you come to know from other sources

502
00:52:10,733 --> 00:52:12,900
I came here to tell you

503
00:52:13,187 --> 00:52:14,187
Hey!

504
00:52:14,858 --> 00:52:18,941
Did he kidnap her or
she ran away with him?

505
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:27,050
Don't you know how to behave?

506
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:33,091
A bloody slave kidnapped king's daughter

507
00:52:34,683 --> 00:52:36,425
It is an insult to all of us.

508
00:52:38,225 --> 00:52:42,252
Let's search for them as
a team from this very moment.

509
00:52:52,266 --> 00:52:54,100
Thank God, we escaped

510
00:52:55,026 --> 00:52:59,219
No. We escaped for a moment, that's it.

511
00:52:59,641 --> 00:53:03,058
This is the place where even
eagles work for them and

512
00:53:04,784 --> 00:53:06,801
Escaping from here is a day dream

513
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,039
What to do now?

514
00:53:10,268 --> 00:53:11,268
I don't know.

515
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:12,441
Where to go now?

516
00:53:15,483 --> 00:53:16,483
I don't know.

517
00:53:32,591 --> 00:53:34,433
Are you angry on me, Bhairava?

518
00:53:36,066 --> 00:53:37,066
Angry on you?

519
00:53:37,641 --> 00:53:39,641
I can't even think
of getting angry on you.

520
00:53:40,984 --> 00:53:42,392
Then, how can I think of love?

521
00:53:51,241 --> 00:53:52,241
Sleep now,

522
00:53:53,475 --> 00:53:54,475
you are tired

523
00:53:57,984 --> 00:53:59,960
I can feel your love, Bhairava.

524
00:54:00,724 --> 00:54:01,944
But you are not realising it.

525
00:54:06,548 --> 00:54:10,241
"The day I saw you first,"

526
00:54:10,527 --> 00:54:13,879
"I lost myself"

527
00:54:14,215 --> 00:54:17,688
"Next time when I saw you"

528
00:54:18,324 --> 00:54:22,407
"I was dumbstruck"

529
00:54:23,232 --> 00:54:26,239
"Third time, out of blush"

530
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:30,224
"I felt unconsciouses"

531
00:54:30,908 --> 00:54:34,401
"Gradually,"

532
00:54:35,225 --> 00:54:40,769
"I fell in love"

533
00:54:41,712 --> 00:54:46,401
"This love is a new experience"

534
00:54:47,332 --> 00:54:52,720
"A feel good emotion"

535
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:58,939
"It is is feel good emotion"

536
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:04,996
"This love is a new experience"

537
00:55:06,373 --> 00:55:11,981
"The moment I saw you first,
I could not even wink"

538
00:55:13,705 --> 00:55:16,636
"Next time when I saw you"

539
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:20,636
"I could not breath"

540
00:55:21,387 --> 00:55:27,077
"I saw you again, I lost myself"

541
00:55:28,776 --> 00:55:31,966
"Gradually"

542
00:55:33,031 --> 00:55:36,093
"I fell in love"

543
00:55:38,578 --> 00:55:43,361
"This love is a new experience"

544
00:55:44,793 --> 00:55:49,393
"A feel good emotion"

545
00:55:50,599 --> 00:55:55,320
"This love is a new experience"

546
00:55:56,631 --> 00:56:02,023
"A feel good emotion"

547
00:56:35,952 --> 00:56:41,633
"An existence of heaven in a
hell and comfortness in fire"

548
00:56:41,953 --> 00:56:46,728
"is a possibility only in love"

549
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:53,806
"Let's join our hands
and bind our hearts"

550
00:56:54,006 --> 00:56:56,774
"Let's erase our fate"

551
00:56:56,846 --> 00:56:59,750
"and spend the rest of our lives together"

552
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:04,754
"This love is a new experience"

553
00:57:05,674 --> 00:57:11,218
"A feel good emotion"

554
00:57:22,967 --> 00:57:24,430
Didn't you sleep all night?

555
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:29,321
I was thinking all night.

556
00:57:30,162 --> 00:57:31,602
I'm unable to understand what to do.

557
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:37,121
No matter how much we think,
some things won't happen as per our wish.

558
00:57:37,177 --> 00:57:39,239
They just happen as per fate.

559
00:57:43,143 --> 00:57:44,651
I'm very hungry.

560
00:57:46,252 --> 00:57:47,252
Come with me.

561
00:58:08,603 --> 00:58:11,403
I've been doing it for the first
time in my life. It is very thrilling.

562
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:34,676
Bhairava!

563
00:59:00,744 --> 00:59:06,303
"Bhairava Geetha... Bhairava Geetha"

564
00:59:07,423 --> 00:59:13,222
"Bhairava Geetha... Bhairava Geetha"

565
00:59:31,696 --> 00:59:36,900
"Bhairava Geetha... Bhairava Geetha"

566
00:59:38,278 --> 00:59:43,943
"Bhairava Geetha... Bhairava Geetha"

567
00:59:53,227 --> 00:59:54,227
Shh!

568
01:00:19,295 --> 01:00:20,295
Hey, let's go there.

569
01:01:16,516 --> 01:01:21,963
"Bhairava Geetha... Bhairava Geetha"

570
01:01:23,285 --> 01:01:25,491
"Bhairava Geetha"

571
01:02:03,363 --> 01:02:06,832
Geetha ma'am, come this side.

572
01:02:15,528 --> 01:02:16,019
Hey!

573
01:02:16,163 --> 01:02:19,188
Stop guys! It can collapse any time.

574
01:02:29,454 --> 01:02:31,244
Geetha ma'am, careful.

575
01:03:07,958 --> 01:03:12,244
- "Geetha... My Bhagavad Gita"
- Damn!

576
01:03:12,292 --> 01:03:15,956
"Bhairava Geetha... Bhairava Geetha"

577
01:03:16,708 --> 01:03:20,869
"Gita... My Bhagavad Gita"

578
01:03:24,464 --> 01:03:25,464
Geetha ma'am

579
01:03:28,135 --> 01:03:30,170
That is my father's hometown

580
01:03:31,716 --> 01:03:32,716
Let's go

581
01:03:57,636 --> 01:04:00,777
- Dear! Bring some water.
- Okay.

582
01:04:05,156 --> 01:04:06,482
Here, have it.

583
01:04:12,436 --> 01:04:14,116
Wash your face with the water in the tank.

584
01:04:30,107 --> 01:04:31,107
That's my son.

585
01:04:31,753 --> 01:04:34,414
He was killed in the fights for master.

586
01:04:35,970 --> 01:04:38,075
By the way, why are you here?

587
01:04:38,359 --> 01:04:39,903
This is my father's hometown.

588
01:04:40,166 --> 01:04:43,409
Is it? What's your father's name?

589
01:04:44,123 --> 01:04:45,123
Bharani Veeranna

590
01:04:51,285 --> 01:04:54,263
Are you the son Veeranna
who used to work for Shankarappa?

591
01:04:54,324 --> 01:04:55,324
Yes.

592
01:04:58,117 --> 01:05:00,774
She did not want to get married,
so she ran away from home.

593
01:05:03,397 --> 01:05:04,873
Your dad was a fighter,

594
01:05:05,441 --> 01:05:06,693
not a weak person to die.

595
01:05:06,869 --> 01:05:07,941
Where is mom?

596
01:05:08,805 --> 01:05:09,885
I kept her at a safe place.

597
01:05:10,248 --> 01:05:11,780
You should have brought her.

598
01:05:12,973 --> 01:05:14,813
Shankarappa's men are
patrolling every village.

599
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:16,400
It's very risky to come out.

600
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:18,836
- Let the issue cool down.
- Okay.

601
01:05:21,239 --> 01:05:24,364
There is a well out there,
everyone baths in that

602
01:05:24,955 --> 01:05:28,297
You are tired.
Take bath and rest.

603
01:05:43,989 --> 01:05:45,030
Shall I ask something?

604
01:05:46,155 --> 01:05:47,155
Yes, Geetha ma'am.

605
01:05:47,939 --> 01:05:52,093
Why do you call me 'Geetha
ma'am' after so much happened?

606
01:05:55,410 --> 01:05:56,866
Call me Geetha.

607
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:02,369
Look, don't call me Geetha ma'am.

608
01:06:03,832 --> 01:06:04,832
Call me Geetha!

609
01:06:07,220 --> 01:06:08,220
Do it.

610
01:06:09,155 --> 01:06:10,155
Geetha

611
01:06:10,447 --> 01:06:14,378
Hey Bhairava, I told you
what I feel about you.

612
01:06:14,442 --> 01:06:17,905
You too tell me what you feel about me.

613
01:06:18,429 --> 01:06:20,399
Tell me. Come on, tell me.

614
01:06:24,872 --> 01:06:25,872
Geetha,

615
01:06:26,822 --> 01:06:29,655
I fell in love with you at first sight.

616
01:06:31,989 --> 01:06:33,509
But what's my status and what's yours?

617
01:06:33,780 --> 01:06:35,614
After spending time with you,

618
01:06:36,147 --> 01:06:40,626
I understood your
nature and loved you more.

619
01:06:41,155 --> 01:06:43,114
But you are from rich family.

620
01:06:46,016 --> 01:06:47,626
Now that I came to you,

621
01:06:48,272 --> 01:06:51,042
Stop thinking about my rich family.

622
01:06:51,737 --> 01:06:55,711
Do what you feel in your heart right now.

623
01:06:56,511 --> 01:06:57,789
What are you thinking about?

624
01:07:45,114 --> 01:07:50,280
"Play with your hands"

625
01:07:51,207 --> 01:07:56,530
"The body is waiting to make influence"

626
01:07:57,189 --> 01:08:01,864
"My fingers showcasing it's
talent in your fingers"

627
01:08:02,905 --> 01:08:08,864
"Seductive drum making Eros
sound in the heart of aphrodite"

628
01:08:09,272 --> 01:08:13,947
"Play with your hands"

629
01:08:44,897 --> 01:08:50,361
"Clothes getting tightened"

630
01:08:50,921 --> 01:08:56,521
"Why these clothes behave mischievous?"

631
01:08:56,888 --> 01:09:02,084
"Arms are getting hotter"

632
01:09:02,868 --> 01:09:08,276
"Why these arms behave mischievous?"

633
01:09:09,030 --> 01:09:13,572
"Let's open the closed doors"

634
01:09:14,947 --> 01:09:20,072
"Let's write light onto darkness"

635
01:09:20,947 --> 01:09:26,614
"Let's indulge in pleasure to the core"

636
01:09:27,072 --> 01:09:32,030
"Play with your hands"

637
01:09:33,072 --> 01:09:38,030
"Play with your hands"

638
01:10:03,230 --> 01:10:08,280
"It is a lustgame"

639
01:10:09,153 --> 01:10:14,364
"Oh body parts, stop your games"

640
01:10:15,155 --> 01:10:20,804
"Hurricane has touched the depths"

641
01:10:21,172 --> 01:10:26,341
"of naval and underarms"

642
01:10:26,947 --> 01:10:32,114
"When the body drench in sweat"

643
01:10:33,106 --> 01:10:38,018
"will it not the clouds envy?"

644
01:10:39,072 --> 01:10:44,864
"Innocent lower lip
is biting upper lip"

645
01:10:46,672 --> 01:10:52,572
"Play with your hands"

646
01:10:52,725 --> 01:10:57,655
"Play with your hands"

647
01:10:58,647 --> 01:11:04,030
"My fingers showcasing it's
talent in your fingers"

648
01:11:04,697 --> 01:11:10,655
"Youthfulness became youthful.
Barren land is now emitting fragrance"

649
01:11:28,728 --> 01:11:31,278
I pity you sometimes Bhairava.

650
01:11:31,990 --> 01:11:32,990
Because,

651
01:11:33,328 --> 01:11:39,084
even animals fight to
survive till their last breath.

652
01:11:39,666 --> 01:11:43,557
But people like you take
slavery for generations...

653
01:11:45,073 --> 01:11:48,100
and are living in bondage
without being aware of it.

654
01:11:50,822 --> 01:11:51,822
Bhairava

655
01:11:52,980 --> 01:11:56,522
Shankarappa'smen are
searching for you from to town to town.

656
01:11:58,389 --> 01:12:00,572
I am scared, I will bring mom.

657
01:12:00,777 --> 01:12:01,777
I will come with you.

658
01:12:01,867 --> 01:12:03,855
No Geetha, you better stay here.

659
01:12:04,175 --> 01:12:06,662
Don't know when
Shankarappa's men can attack.

660
01:12:07,072 --> 01:12:09,032
It will be difficult to escape
if you are with me.

661
01:12:09,274 --> 01:12:11,433
Be careful,
I'll be waiting for you

662
01:12:11,441 --> 01:12:12,512
- Let's go
- Okay.

663
01:12:17,655 --> 01:12:18,655
Speak up

664
01:12:19,489 --> 01:12:20,864
Speak up now

665
01:12:25,164 --> 01:12:26,539
If you don't speak up,

666
01:12:26,964 --> 01:12:28,130
I'll slit your throats,

667
01:12:28,855 --> 01:12:32,655
burn you to ashes.

668
01:12:43,355 --> 01:12:47,697
Let's see if they
speak up after he dies.

669
01:12:48,097 --> 01:12:50,070
Mallana, I don't know anything.

670
01:12:52,239 --> 01:12:55,197
I swear on Bairappa,
I don't know, master.

671
01:13:43,340 --> 01:13:46,116
Everyone who went behind him
would face this same situation

672
01:13:46,316 --> 01:13:47,860
and they should know it.

673
01:14:13,980 --> 01:14:16,049
I will tell you
where Lakshma'amma is

674
01:14:16,169 --> 01:14:19,813
Master, please leave them. I beg you

675
01:14:22,905 --> 01:14:25,255
Bring this filthy birth along!

676
01:14:57,347 --> 01:14:59,370
Please spare my son, master.

677
01:15:00,697 --> 01:15:03,197
He hasn't done anything wrong.

678
01:15:06,305 --> 01:15:11,947
My husband gave his life for you,
spare my son for his sake.

679
01:15:13,897 --> 01:15:16,189
He did not die for me for free.

680
01:15:16,655 --> 01:15:19,947
I fed him everyday,
paid him every month.

681
01:15:21,397 --> 01:15:23,689
You people are meant to die for me.

682
01:15:29,227 --> 01:15:33,697
Is there no value
for my husband's life?

683
01:15:35,630 --> 01:15:40,030
Your son betrayed the one who fed him.

684
01:15:48,405 --> 01:15:49,405
Speak up

685
01:15:50,780 --> 01:15:53,614
Where is he? Speak up

686
01:15:54,664 --> 01:15:56,451
- Speak up.
- Stop it

687
01:16:00,230 --> 01:16:02,897
How would she understand
our pain if you beat her?

688
01:16:03,964 --> 01:16:06,455
How will she know our pain?

689
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:18,989
It's very hot here.

690
01:16:48,399 --> 01:16:52,017
No!

691
01:16:54,630 --> 01:16:57,504
My fiancee slapped me

692
01:16:57,608 --> 01:17:01,376
for slapping your son.

693
01:17:55,489 --> 01:17:59,477
- Speak up, you witch!
- She's no more, master.

694
01:17:59,586 --> 01:18:00,586
Huh?

695
01:18:28,979 --> 01:18:31,151
Mother... Mother!

696
01:18:32,367 --> 01:18:35,557
Mother... Mother!

697
01:18:36,745 --> 01:18:37,745
Bhaira...

698
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:39,995
Shanku... Shanku!

699
01:18:42,789 --> 01:18:47,572
Shankarappa and
Nanjamari beat her to death.

700
01:18:49,422 --> 01:18:52,661
I could not save her, Bhaira.

701
01:18:54,383 --> 01:18:55,383
Bhaira...

702
01:19:48,164 --> 01:19:53,672
"The one who sang lullaby to me"

703
01:19:54,180 --> 01:19:59,630
"The one made swing in her turn saree"

704
01:19:59,680 --> 01:20:05,276
"No one should suffer performing"

705
01:20:05,676 --> 01:20:11,052
"last rights of such a mother"

706
01:20:12,222 --> 01:20:17,630
"O mother, you are my world"

707
01:20:17,722 --> 01:20:23,089
"Tell me mother, why did you leave me?"

708
01:20:23,705 --> 01:20:29,214
"I will cry like a baby,
if you don't open your eyes"

709
01:20:30,139 --> 01:20:35,589
"You used to cry when I had any cut"

710
01:20:36,264 --> 01:20:41,547
"You used to clean me,
pamper me and sing for me"

711
01:20:41,764 --> 01:20:47,047
"My mother is sleeping,
don't call her a corpse"

712
01:20:48,264 --> 01:20:53,839
"Do I have to cover the
mouth of the one who fed me?"

713
01:20:54,164 --> 01:20:58,989
"Do I have to send off in
palanquin the goddess who gave birth?"

714
01:20:59,289 --> 01:21:05,236
"Mother..."

715
01:21:06,222 --> 01:21:11,597
"Mother please talk, tell me a story"

716
01:21:11,747 --> 01:21:16,047
"Your son is all alone now"

717
01:21:17,780 --> 01:21:23,630
"Oven is still hot, the leaf is not cut"

718
01:21:23,664 --> 01:21:28,946
"I know you are not dead"

719
01:21:44,350 --> 01:21:45,745
Why are you crying?

720
01:21:45,945 --> 01:21:47,230
It is not their fault

721
01:21:47,689 --> 01:21:52,022
You people are bonded labours
to Shankarappa for generations.

722
01:21:52,172 --> 01:21:56,272
We are born slaves,
we live like slaves and we die like slaves

723
01:21:56,930 --> 01:21:59,605
They will fix plough to a calf.

724
01:22:00,097 --> 01:22:03,230
These people take life
and die on their orders.

725
01:22:03,772 --> 01:22:07,314
Have you ever thought why
these people are living?

726
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:11,272
Your type of people
blindly obey their orders.

727
01:22:11,664 --> 01:22:14,855
You live like slaves
without any self respect.

728
01:22:15,164 --> 01:22:17,447
You'll kill on their orders,
you'll burn on their orders.

729
01:22:17,555 --> 01:22:21,022
Because of us, these people
have become herd of sheeps.

730
01:22:22,364 --> 01:22:27,113
Today you suffered, yesterday it was us,
tomorrow someone else will.

731
01:22:28,555 --> 01:22:32,222
Till you come out of the slavery,
this fire will keep you burning.

732
01:22:49,114 --> 01:22:52,855
I could not even bare when
my mom got hurt by a thorn.

733
01:22:53,864 --> 01:22:59,772
They cut her face with a knife, tied her
like an animal and beat her to death.

734
01:23:01,164 --> 01:23:05,897
I feel rage thinking about
the pain my mom suffered.

735
01:23:09,405 --> 01:23:12,730
What wrong did I do,
which made them torture her to death?

736
01:23:13,864 --> 01:23:16,272
I was their slipper when they walked.

737
01:23:16,989 --> 01:23:18,855
I watched over them when they slept.

738
01:23:20,064 --> 01:23:22,564
I took life when asked me
to take out the sword.

739
01:23:27,030 --> 01:23:28,030
Geetha!

740
01:23:31,047 --> 01:23:33,905
It started because of me,
it will end when I die.

741
01:23:34,130 --> 01:23:35,397
Have you gone mad, Geetha?

742
01:23:41,222 --> 01:23:43,022
Do you think it is all because of you?

743
01:23:43,614 --> 01:23:45,522
Do you think it will end with your death?

744
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:50,439
You asking me to get married and
coming with me is not the issue.

745
01:23:53,264 --> 01:23:58,633
I obeyed every orders
without a second thought,

746
01:23:59,445 --> 01:24:00,445
That's my mistake.

747
01:24:01,439 --> 01:24:02,503
What I did was wrong?

748
01:24:03,955 --> 01:24:06,105
Your death is not the answer, Geetha.

749
01:24:06,822 --> 01:24:11,272
Killing every man who treat
humans as slaves is the right answer.

750
01:24:11,530 --> 01:24:14,355
You can't live fighting
them, you will lose.

751
01:24:15,039 --> 01:24:17,939
I've nothing left to live or lose, Geetha

752
01:24:18,947 --> 01:24:20,343
except slavery.

753
01:24:20,697 --> 01:24:22,817
Why do you want to fight them
if you are going to die?

754
01:24:22,905 --> 01:24:24,564
I am realising now, Geetha.

755
01:24:25,739 --> 01:24:30,855
Rather than living like a slave,
it is better to fight them and die.

756
01:24:31,747 --> 01:24:34,730
Geetha, don't think that
you are the reason for all this.

757
01:24:35,580 --> 01:24:37,272
It was suppose to happen long back.

758
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:40,064
It is happening now because of you

759
01:24:41,472 --> 01:24:41,930
Geetha

760
01:24:42,289 --> 01:24:45,564
We don't realise the sharpness
until sword is in the sheath.

761
01:24:46,289 --> 01:24:48,855
We know it when we stab
the opposite person.

762
01:24:49,872 --> 01:24:51,897
Now, it is the time to show the sharpness.

763
01:24:53,122 --> 01:24:54,122
It is the right time.

764
01:25:00,250 --> 01:25:01,250
Bhairava

765
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:02,583
He is Irabhadra

766
01:25:03,083 --> 01:25:05,417
he is a bomb expert

767
01:25:05,708 --> 01:25:08,583
He makes bombs which can
turn boulders to dust

768
01:25:11,250 --> 01:25:16,875
Bloody Nanjamari molested and killed
my daughter in young age.

769
01:25:20,042 --> 01:25:22,750
I am living in helplessness

770
01:25:24,542 --> 01:25:25,542
He is Krishnappa

771
01:25:26,167 --> 01:25:28,667
He is capable of killing
four men in a single blow

772
01:25:30,095 --> 01:25:31,905
He is Basavanna

773
01:25:32,105 --> 01:25:34,125
He is an expert boar hunter

774
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,167
He is Kempanna

775
01:25:36,375 --> 01:25:39,625
Madesha, Rudrappa, Siddappa, Enktesa

776
01:25:39,833 --> 01:25:45,375
They are all waiting from long time
for the opportunity to kill them

777
01:26:01,167 --> 01:26:02,167
You faced it yesterday

778
01:26:03,167 --> 01:26:04,167
today it's me

779
01:26:04,917 --> 01:26:07,458
if we keep quite till
someone else face the same

780
01:26:08,292 --> 01:26:09,875
then our lives
will not have any meaning

781
01:26:13,042 --> 01:26:14,208
Let us not spare anyone

782
01:26:15,250 --> 01:26:16,667
Must kill each and everyone

783
01:26:17,958 --> 01:26:21,833
We must beat them such a way that
everyone should weep like a baby

784
01:26:22,750 --> 01:26:24,292
We must shed blood

785
01:26:24,958 --> 01:26:27,542
We must anoint the city with blood

786
01:26:29,042 --> 01:26:32,158
"Vande Mataram!"

787
01:26:32,645 --> 01:26:36,069
"Vande Mataram!"

788
01:26:36,466 --> 01:26:40,188
"Vande Mataram!"

789
01:26:40,458 --> 01:26:42,790
"Let this fist of slavery clench"

790
01:26:44,216 --> 01:26:46,665
"Let those lord's fear"

791
01:26:48,172 --> 01:26:51,029
"Vande Mataram!"

792
01:26:52,250 --> 01:26:54,439
"Let the grieving soul hold a weapon"

793
01:26:55,911 --> 01:26:58,260
"Let the evildoers heads fall off"

794
01:27:00,250 --> 01:27:02,856
"Slavery days are over"

795
01:27:03,866 --> 01:27:06,844
"Revolting time has begun"

796
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,958
"We hold umbrellas
to the rich lord no more"

797
01:27:11,792 --> 01:27:14,958
"We chop off heads till end"

798
01:27:15,708 --> 01:27:19,375
"We are not a herd of sheep to run away
for your roaring"

799
01:27:19,583 --> 01:27:23,000
"We are the ferocious tigers
who stab your heart"

800
01:27:23,458 --> 01:27:26,917
"We are not children to
obey on your shoutings"

801
01:27:27,292 --> 01:27:30,625
"We are the destructive weapons
You wait and watch"

802
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:34,378
"Vande Mataram!"

803
01:27:34,625 --> 01:27:36,949
"Let this chain of slavery break."

804
01:27:38,453 --> 01:27:40,823
"Let those lord's fear"

805
01:27:58,083 --> 01:28:01,917
"They told us to
tie lungi and bend down"

806
01:28:02,292 --> 01:28:05,708
"They told us to keep scarf
in underarms and squat"

807
01:28:05,792 --> 01:28:09,792
"Vande Mataram!"

808
01:28:09,817 --> 01:28:13,333
"They told us
to leave the slipper outside"

809
01:28:13,792 --> 01:28:17,167
"Seeing us surrendering
they slaved us"

810
01:28:17,625 --> 01:28:21,167
"Time has come
to clear the black clouds"

811
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:25,042
"A new hope is born in our hopeless life"

812
01:28:25,167 --> 01:28:27,508
"Let this fist of slavery clench"

813
01:28:28,776 --> 01:28:31,068
"Let those lord's fear"

814
01:28:32,701 --> 01:28:34,985
"Let the grieving soul hold a weapon"

815
01:28:36,600 --> 01:28:39,256
"Let the evildoers heads fall off"

816
01:28:57,958 --> 01:29:01,599
"We must get freedom"

817
01:29:01,799 --> 01:29:05,194
"We must get freedom"

818
01:29:06,042 --> 01:29:09,792
"Does the lords have thick skin?"

819
01:29:09,958 --> 01:29:13,417
"Is his bones and muscles made of steel?"

820
01:29:13,750 --> 01:29:15,375
"Vande Mataram!"

821
01:29:15,417 --> 01:29:19,167
"If he stab him he will die instantly"

822
01:29:19,583 --> 01:29:23,083
"If he realises this
He will correct himself"

823
01:29:23,500 --> 01:29:27,042
"Bhairava incarnated as
Bhargava to wage war"

824
01:29:27,375 --> 01:29:30,750
"He is going to create a chaos"

825
01:29:30,917 --> 01:29:33,292
"When we wage war"

826
01:29:34,583 --> 01:29:37,250
"You all will learn a lesson"

827
01:29:38,417 --> 01:29:41,125
"When we wage war"

828
01:29:42,333 --> 01:29:44,917
"You all will learn a lesson"

829
01:29:46,292 --> 01:29:49,582
"Vande Mataram!"

830
01:29:50,058 --> 01:29:53,295
"Vande Mataram!"

831
01:29:53,913 --> 01:29:57,606
"Vande Mataram!"

832
01:29:57,806 --> 01:30:01,613
"Vande Mataram!"

833
01:30:03,611 --> 01:30:05,153
Bloody Bhairava!

834
01:30:06,481 --> 01:30:10,317
Provoking everyone against us

835
01:30:11,079 --> 01:30:14,076
Just because slaves
got united against me

836
01:30:14,433 --> 01:30:16,470
I am not going to get scared

837
01:30:18,051 --> 01:30:19,051
Wait and watch

838
01:30:19,612 --> 01:30:24,966
I'll chop off the heads
of all those revolting dogs

839
01:30:28,534 --> 01:30:32,135
Flame in their hearts may be
a tiny one, Shankarappa

840
01:30:33,312 --> 01:30:36,207
if we don't extinguish that flame now

841
01:30:37,327 --> 01:30:40,845
it will grow into wildfire and
burns entire forest

842
01:30:42,907 --> 01:30:45,971
Wild fire has no mercy, Shankarappa

843
01:30:48,335 --> 01:30:51,614
Whether it's a tiger or a deer...

844
01:30:52,692 --> 01:30:54,484
it will burn them to ashes

845
01:30:55,740 --> 01:30:57,018
Shankarappa...

846
01:30:59,765 --> 01:31:02,183
I've told Nanjamari...

847
01:31:04,382 --> 01:31:07,533
to extinguish that flame

848
01:31:44,490 --> 01:31:47,683
Bring out everyone from their homes

849
01:32:10,268 --> 01:32:11,268
We searched everywhere

850
01:32:11,602 --> 01:32:14,328
No one is here, all have escaped

851
01:32:14,681 --> 01:32:15,306
No one is here

852
01:32:15,704 --> 01:32:19,546
They were ready to face us and fight

853
01:32:20,429 --> 01:32:21,801
Is this your bravery?

854
01:32:23,086 --> 01:32:25,290
Why are you all hiding? Come out.

855
01:32:26,799 --> 01:32:28,102
Bloody slaves

856
01:32:28,897 --> 01:32:33,785
Surrender Bhairava to me
or else I will burn down your homes

857
01:33:06,439 --> 01:33:08,505
Why you came alone?

858
01:33:09,207 --> 01:33:10,783
Where are you hiding that witch?

859
01:33:11,478 --> 01:33:12,562
Bring her to me

860
01:33:46,179 --> 01:33:47,301
What are you waiting for?

861
01:33:49,606 --> 01:33:51,626
Chop off everyone

862
01:36:23,820 --> 01:36:25,196
Hey Shankarappa!

863
01:36:42,410 --> 01:36:46,416
Nanjamari came to our town thinking
we will bow down to him

864
01:36:48,229 --> 01:36:50,473
We beat them to hell

865
01:36:51,324 --> 01:36:54,414
If you and your men come in our way

866
01:36:55,142 --> 01:36:57,412
I came here to warn you
that this will happen

867
01:36:59,524 --> 01:37:01,044
We all have decided

868
01:37:02,750 --> 01:37:06,454
we will settle down in our villages

869
01:37:07,659 --> 01:37:09,605
Don't come in our way

870
01:37:11,197 --> 01:37:13,798
You will be held responsible
if you raise a sword

871
01:37:15,966 --> 01:37:20,131
Not even a single
soul should be killed by you

872
01:37:23,189 --> 01:37:24,721
If not...

873
01:37:28,394 --> 01:37:32,978
Your dead body will be found
between these dead bodies

874
01:37:33,993 --> 01:37:39,312
Before you treat anyone as slaves,
look at these dead bodies

875
01:37:40,857 --> 01:37:42,446
I will make you pee

876
01:37:49,731 --> 01:37:51,279
One more thing, Shankarappa

877
01:37:52,846 --> 01:37:57,384
Your daughter voluntarily came with me,
I didn't take her

878
01:38:02,707 --> 01:38:04,474
Now we are in love

879
01:38:07,743 --> 01:38:08,896
Forget about her

880
01:38:12,312 --> 01:38:14,955
This is your last chance for you too

881
01:38:15,461 --> 01:38:18,645
We have been slaves
for these bloody fellows till now

882
01:38:19,901 --> 01:38:22,260
Correct your mistake now
and join me

883
01:38:22,894 --> 01:38:28,293
Or else keep you swords at home, work
in fields with your wives and children

884
01:38:29,488 --> 01:38:35,471
If in case, your swords come between
my sword and their heads

885
01:38:36,330 --> 01:38:38,795
I will not hesitate to kill you all

886
01:39:02,267 --> 01:39:04,269
Chenmallappa, what brings you here?

887
01:39:05,175 --> 01:39:09,833
There is an important matter for you.
You will not say no at any cost

888
01:39:11,723 --> 01:39:15,130
We planned to assassin Shankarappa,
two years back

889
01:39:15,330 --> 01:39:18,316
You dad and Shankarappa
hid themselves in bushes

890
01:39:18,587 --> 01:39:24,408
Shankarappa told your dad
to cover his blanket and run

891
01:39:25,451 --> 01:39:29,644
We mistook your dad
to Shankarappa and killed him

892
01:39:30,669 --> 01:39:35,615
You are confessing to us
that you killed our friend!

893
01:39:36,357 --> 01:39:39,536
Can you walk away from here alive?

894
01:39:42,494 --> 01:39:45,990
A smart person will think of the reason
behind the death, not the killer

895
01:39:46,995 --> 01:39:47,781
Come to the point

896
01:39:47,981 --> 01:39:51,839
Bhairava, spirit is not enough
to kill a strong enemy

897
01:39:52,561 --> 01:39:54,108
a strong support is required

898
01:39:57,939 --> 01:40:02,965
An enemy knows the weakness
of a person better than his wife

899
01:40:03,962 --> 01:40:07,523
I've been waiting for ten
years to kill Shankarappa

900
01:40:08,302 --> 01:40:10,947
He is escaping death every time

901
01:40:12,914 --> 01:40:18,703
If your courage and my experience
join hands, we can shed blood

902
01:40:20,893 --> 01:40:21,893
What's your decision?

903
01:40:22,466 --> 01:40:25,366
Let us presume, we kill Shankarappa

904
01:40:26,304 --> 01:40:27,304
What next?

905
01:40:28,197 --> 01:40:32,276
What else you expect?
We will be the lords of this land

906
01:40:34,927 --> 01:40:36,839
This war is not for winning power

907
01:40:37,572 --> 01:40:39,910
This war is to end the power play

908
01:40:42,124 --> 01:40:45,420
If I kill Shankarappa with your help,
tomorrow you will try to overpower me

909
01:40:46,373 --> 01:40:47,983
We don't need another landlord

910
01:40:49,376 --> 01:40:50,435
One more thing

911
01:40:51,996 --> 01:40:54,602
Leave your men
on their own, from now on

912
01:40:55,639 --> 01:40:57,503
If you try to rule them

913
01:40:59,104 --> 01:41:01,428
Your head will fall next to
Shankarappa's head

914
01:41:03,774 --> 01:41:06,263
I came to know about the humiliation
you faced by those slaves

915
01:41:08,379 --> 01:41:13,377
We must eradicate him who built
people against us and his people

916
01:41:14,110 --> 01:41:17,686
Dogs should not snatch food
in a fight between a tiger and a loin

917
01:41:18,884 --> 01:41:21,475
If we keep our egoism at this time

918
01:41:23,024 --> 01:41:25,608
Those bloody slaves will burn our throne

919
01:41:26,242 --> 01:41:27,537
that is why I called you here

920
01:41:28,066 --> 01:41:30,855
Let us join hands and double our power

921
01:41:31,160 --> 01:41:34,937
Let us deal our issues after we kill him

922
01:41:36,722 --> 01:41:40,582
But now, a lion
should join another lion

923
01:41:47,195 --> 01:41:51,785
His followers and his praisers

924
01:41:52,997 --> 01:41:55,109
are all under my radar.

925
01:41:56,733 --> 01:41:57,814
What shall we do now?

926
01:41:58,377 --> 01:42:01,078
His death should be memorable

927
01:42:03,469 --> 01:42:05,004
For generations to come

928
01:42:05,774 --> 01:42:11,520
These slaves should live and die slaves
keeping his death in their minds

929
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:17,165
Our enemies should be
reminded of his death

930
01:42:22,365 --> 01:42:27,525
They are flirts who fool and
make girls pregnant and ditch

931
01:42:28,818 --> 01:42:32,961
But our Bhairava
can wage war for you

932
01:42:34,586 --> 01:42:36,260
You are very fortunate in this matter

933
01:42:41,737 --> 01:42:43,627
Did you hear any sound?

934
01:42:43,759 --> 01:42:44,759
Huh?

935
01:42:47,566 --> 01:42:49,230
Probably, that bloody dog

936
01:42:49,801 --> 01:42:50,801
Hmm...

937
01:42:51,371 --> 01:42:55,002
By the way, Who proposed first?
You or him?

938
01:42:55,202 --> 01:42:58,828
In fact, it is enough
for the two to fall in love

939
01:42:59,028 --> 01:43:00,776
Need not express love in words

940
01:43:04,329 --> 01:43:07,394
Expressing love in words
is not love at all

941
01:43:07,904 --> 01:43:08,904
Isn't it?

942
01:43:17,285 --> 01:43:18,306
Run

943
01:43:21,300 --> 01:43:22,400
Run Geeta

944
01:45:13,606 --> 01:45:16,497
Have you left me all alone?

945
01:45:39,153 --> 01:45:40,383
Hey Bhairava

946
01:45:40,884 --> 01:45:42,656
This is the blood of Somiah

947
01:45:43,101 --> 01:45:45,556
I didn't kill that witch yet

948
01:45:45,968 --> 01:45:49,581
I will enjoy and kill her before you.

949
01:45:50,226 --> 01:45:53,240
I dare you to come and stop that. Come!

950
01:46:19,424 --> 01:46:21,354
I will not question your actions

951
01:46:23,605 --> 01:46:27,841
I'll not ask, why you ran away
with that slave

952
01:46:30,124 --> 01:46:34,535
I thought an educated
girl will be of help...

953
01:46:35,467 --> 01:46:37,229
but you ran away like mad!

954
01:46:40,214 --> 01:46:43,214
I beared you on my shoulders and raised
you but you have kicked me on heart.

955
01:46:44,689 --> 01:46:48,332
You ruined my reputation for sake of them.

956
01:46:54,403 --> 01:46:57,617
You think they all changed?!

957
01:47:00,367 --> 01:47:03,006
Once Bhairava is stabbed in heart...

958
01:47:03,684 --> 01:47:06,661
they will become my slaves.

959
01:47:19,508 --> 01:47:23,781
To forget what has happened
you must die

960
01:47:49,783 --> 01:47:51,466
Your pride has brought you death.

961
01:48:00,554 --> 01:48:02,340
As he see that body, to kill us

962
01:48:03,305 --> 01:48:07,662
he will think we will be in village,
so he will come this way, with his men

963
01:48:09,251 --> 01:48:14,270
We will wait here than in village,
and surround him when he comes

964
01:48:14,942 --> 01:48:18,432
Let's kill that witch in
front of him and then kill him

965
01:48:18,914 --> 01:48:20,736
Go now!

966
01:51:40,943 --> 01:51:41,948
Bhairava!

967
01:51:58,946 --> 01:52:01,691
Geeta!

968
01:53:58,167 --> 01:53:59,569
Don't cry Bhairava

969
01:54:00,082 --> 01:54:05,449
You proved slavery
is not without but within

970
01:54:09,986 --> 01:54:13,965
Bhairava and Geetha got married
and set an example for everyone

971
01:54:14,366 --> 01:54:17,129
What needs to be destroyed in this
world are the unnecessary wars

972
01:54:17,329 --> 01:54:19,999
but not the good example
this couple has set

973
01:54:20,199 --> 01:54:23,112
Rich people's rule should be abolished
and poor people should be uplifted

974
01:54:23,312 --> 01:54:25,406
The principle of Vande Mataram
should be made true.
