00:04:08,495 --> 00:04:10,554

in politics.

Adorn the nuptial necklace

Khurana sir, this is my daughter's
first marriage.

69
00:05:35,181 --> 00:05:37,012
It is our Santosh's
first marriage too.

70
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:38,914
No, no I didn't mean that.

71
00:05:39,152 --> 00:05:41,518
This is the first marriage
in our family.

72
00:05:41,888 --> 00:05:43,185
She is my only daughter.

73
00:05:43,723 --> 00:05:45,816
Santosh is our only
neighbour in Mumbai.

74
00:05:45,892 --> 00:05:47,086
Fine!

75
00:05:47,794 --> 00:05:51,525
She has never travelled
without her parents!

76
00:05:51,998 --> 00:05:53,863
How will she go alone to Mumbai?

77
00:05:53,933 --> 00:05:54,991
In the plane, sir.

78
00:05:55,101 --> 00:05:56,159
Fine!
- Yes

79
00:05:56,703 --> 00:05:58,466
Actually, she never stayed
without the parents...

80
00:05:58,538 --> 00:05:59,596
...the absence of her parents...
- Singh sir!

81
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:01,204
Calm down.
- Fine!

82
00:06:01,474 --> 00:06:03,669
Now garland each other.

83
00:06:07,213 --> 00:06:10,205
'Singh sir it is said
all over the world.'

84
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,843
'Once if someone bows
down before his wife...

85
00:06:13,153 --> 00:06:14,518
...he will always bow down! '

86
00:06:18,124 --> 00:06:19,182
Just a minute.

87
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:21,985
Now garland me!

88
00:06:28,201 --> 00:06:31,034
'She garlanded me so easily even
though I stood straight! '

89
00:06:31,771 --> 00:06:33,500
'No matter, atleast I
didn't bow my head! '

90
00:06:47,754 --> 00:06:49,688
Khurana sir, why is she crying?

91
00:06:50,123 --> 00:06:54,219
Because... - Santosh, girls always
cry during the send off!

92
00:06:55,195 --> 00:06:56,253
Should I cry too?

93
00:06:56,529 --> 00:06:57,587
Are you a girl?

94
00:06:57,664 --> 00:06:58,722
No, no I am a boy.

95
00:06:59,532 --> 00:07:00,590
So!

96
00:07:02,202 --> 00:07:03,260
What are you remembering?

97
00:07:04,637 --> 00:07:05,968
What are you remembering?

98
00:07:06,206 --> 00:07:07,537
First you tell me!
- No, first you tell me.

99
00:07:07,607 --> 00:07:09,131
First you tell me!
- What are you both remembering!

100
00:07:11,277 --> 00:07:12,539
Our first night.

101
00:07:13,213 --> 00:07:14,805
You are too much!

102
00:07:15,548 --> 00:07:17,038
Today is our first night too!

103
00:07:17,584 --> 00:07:18,642
Really!

104
00:07:19,953 --> 00:07:21,011
He is so sweet.

105
00:07:23,156 --> 00:07:30,062
Santosh, a young daughter is a very
big responsibility for her parents.

106
00:07:31,631 --> 00:07:35,567
And from today, I handover this
responsibility to you son.

107
00:07:40,306 --> 00:07:41,773
This responsibility is very heavy!

108
00:07:42,142 --> 00:07:43,302
This responsibility is very heavy!

109
00:07:43,576 --> 00:07:45,271
This responsibility is very heavy!

110
00:07:45,345 --> 00:07:47,040
This responsibility is very heavy!

111
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,808
This responsibility is very heavy!

112
00:07:48,882 --> 00:07:50,213
I cannot shoulder it!

113
00:07:50,617 --> 00:07:51,675
Very heavy!

114
00:07:51,751 --> 00:07:53,218
What are you looking
at so awestruck?

115
00:07:53,653 --> 00:07:54,779
He is married.

116
00:07:55,321 --> 00:07:56,583
He is here physically!

117
00:07:56,656 --> 00:07:57,714
But his mind is with is wife.

118
00:07:57,891 --> 00:07:59,222
It happens with you too!

119
00:07:59,626 --> 00:08:02,322
Keep seated. Your work
will be done too.

120
00:08:03,062 --> 00:08:06,190
We Indians have a bad habit of
interfering in others matters.

121
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:07,724
That's what?

122
00:08:07,801 --> 00:08:10,326
Brother, what have you been doing
for the last 10 minutes?

123
00:08:10,603 --> 00:08:12,002
Are you fine?

124
00:08:12,238 --> 00:08:13,296
Forgive me!

125
00:08:21,347 --> 00:08:23,338
Were you counting the
notes or weighing it!

126
00:08:24,117 --> 00:08:26,278
Santosh, stop daydreaming.

127
00:08:27,053 --> 00:08:28,611
Do you work!

128
00:08:28,688 --> 00:08:29,746
Please do your work!

129
00:08:30,123 --> 00:08:31,351
You are looking very refreshed!

130
00:08:31,424 --> 00:08:32,618
Did you come back from home?

131
00:08:32,692 --> 00:08:33,750
You say something too!

132
00:08:33,827 --> 00:08:35,317
You cannot control yourself
from saying anything.

133
00:08:35,628 --> 00:08:38,153
What can I say, senior
sir is very hungry!

134
00:08:38,631 --> 00:08:40,121
If he is hungry then go
and feed him something!

135
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,360
Why are you eating my head?

136
00:08:41,634 --> 00:08:44,626
What can I feed him, he is that
hungry with a hot temper.

137
00:08:44,704 --> 00:08:45,898
Mr. Mishra, that's angry!

138
00:08:46,172 --> 00:08:47,366
It is called being angry!

139
00:08:47,774 --> 00:08:50,208
And you call others illiterate!

140
00:08:50,276 --> 00:08:51,937
But you never think
about what you say!

141
00:08:52,011 --> 00:08:53,376
Don't think I am so stupid sir.

142
00:08:53,813 --> 00:08:55,371
I am from the Bamboot family.

143
00:08:55,682 --> 00:08:57,172
I have done double M. A after B. A!

144
00:08:57,817 --> 00:08:58,875
Why have you done double
M. A after B. A?

145
00:08:59,185 --> 00:09:00,652
On the day of the first M. A
exam I had dysentery...

146
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,211
...I fell unconscious at the
threshold of the centre.

147
00:09:03,289 --> 00:09:04,381
And I couldn't give the paper.

148
00:09:04,657 --> 00:09:07,387
I passed in the next exam.

149
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,325
I used to speak fluent English!

150
00:09:09,395 --> 00:09:12,387
These days... my vocabulary
has become weak.

151
00:09:12,465 --> 00:09:16,401
Will you listen to my bio-data or
come and give yours too. Come on!

152
00:09:16,469 --> 00:09:17,902
If you have finished preaching,
then I can go!

153
00:09:18,171 --> 00:09:20,332
Come on, or else he will make
us see stars in the morning.

154
00:09:20,907 --> 00:09:23,740
Our bank is open 24 hours
a day, but still...

155
00:09:23,977 --> 00:09:25,035
May I come in sir?

156
00:09:25,178 --> 00:09:28,079
Yes, please come.

157
00:09:29,015 --> 00:09:30,073
You called me sir?

158
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,742
No, no! I don't have
the dare to call you.

159
00:09:33,987 --> 00:09:35,045
Oh, I am sorry, sir.

160
00:09:35,121 --> 00:09:36,179
I will go and show that Mishra...

161
00:09:36,256 --> 00:09:37,689
Anyway Santosh, now
that you have arrived...

162
00:09:37,757 --> 00:09:40,692
...take a seat!
- You said you didn't call!

163
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,092
Sit down!
- Yes sir

164
00:09:43,863 --> 00:09:44,921
Do you recognize him?

165
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,758
Yes sir!

166
00:09:48,835 --> 00:09:49,893
He was at the counter.

167
00:09:50,436 --> 00:09:52,700
Yes, I was standing in the line.

168
00:09:53,273 --> 00:09:55,434
And he was behaving strangely
for a long time.

169
00:09:55,508 --> 00:09:56,702
No sir, sir please.

170
00:09:56,776 --> 00:09:57,868
Please try to understand...
- Okay, it easy!

171
00:09:58,811 --> 00:10:00,244
You carry on I will
teach him a lesson.

172
00:10:00,313 --> 00:10:02,076
Sorry for all the trouble,
it won't happen again.

173
00:10:02,148 --> 00:10:03,206
Thank you very much!

174
00:10:03,449 --> 00:10:05,041
Very sorry sir, very sorry.

175
00:10:06,386 --> 00:10:07,444
Let it be sir.

176
00:10:08,154 --> 00:10:12,454
I am very sorry sir! Sir...
- Santosh, what is your problem?

177
00:10:12,525 --> 00:10:15,790
Sir, my thoughts... and
I am not feeling fine.

178
00:10:16,462 --> 00:10:19,226
I know, I know I will tell you.

179
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,027
All night long you argue
with your wife...

180
00:10:22,302 --> 00:10:23,360
...that's why you can't sleep.

181
00:10:23,736 --> 00:10:25,203
And you behave strangely
during the day.

182
00:10:26,205 --> 00:10:28,366
But it is important for you to
be professional in the bank.

183
00:10:28,441 --> 00:10:29,738
I know.
- You can't be like this.

184
00:10:29,809 --> 00:10:31,436
I know sir.
- Take a look at me.

185
00:10:31,744 --> 00:10:32,802
I am married too.

186
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:35,973
What can I say, not everyone
is fortunate like you.

187
00:10:36,115 --> 00:10:38,208
That's right.

188
00:10:40,253 --> 00:10:44,212
That's why I still remember the
time she met me for the first time.

189
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:45,752
How was that sir?

190
00:10:50,496 --> 00:10:52,487
Hi!
- Hi!

191
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:58,128
She is nice looking!

192
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,502
Which one of you is the boy?

193
00:11:02,809 --> 00:11:03,867
Both of us!

194
00:11:03,943 --> 00:11:05,001
Both of us are boys!

195
00:11:05,912 --> 00:11:06,970
Very funny!

196
00:11:07,347 --> 00:11:10,783
I meant, which one of
you wants to marry me?

197
00:11:11,284 --> 00:11:13,445
You or you?
- Me.

198
00:11:14,787 --> 00:11:15,845
Okay!

199
00:11:15,989 --> 00:11:20,119
I have some questions, which
till now no one could answer.

200
00:11:20,793 --> 00:11:21,885
Can you answer it!

201
00:11:23,463 --> 00:11:24,521
Yes. Yes.

202
00:11:25,331 --> 00:11:26,525
By the way, who is he?

203
00:11:27,033 --> 00:11:28,523
He is my friend!
- Prem!

204
00:11:29,302 --> 00:11:31,031
He was scared, that's why
I came along with him.

205
00:11:31,104 --> 00:11:32,537
Who will answer my question?

206
00:11:33,006 --> 00:11:34,303
You or him!

207
00:11:35,942 --> 00:11:37,170
Of course him!
- Yes.

208
00:11:38,277 --> 00:11:39,335
Okay.

209
00:11:40,346 --> 00:11:41,973
Do you know what my
requirements are?

210
00:11:42,348 --> 00:11:43,406
Comfort and luxury! - Love.

211
00:11:45,818 --> 00:11:47,877
Seems like he is more experienced!

212
00:11:48,921 --> 00:11:51,549
Are you married?
- No, I am not!

213
00:11:52,492 --> 00:11:53,550
Okay!

214
00:11:54,394 --> 00:11:55,452
Question number 2.

215
00:11:56,496 --> 00:11:58,020
What is the limit of love?

216
00:12:00,566 --> 00:12:02,557
Hello, say it to me.

217
00:12:04,203 --> 00:12:05,568
Me! - Yes, you!

218
00:12:07,407 --> 00:12:08,840
It is said, until the seven births.

219
00:12:09,075 --> 00:12:10,133
What does love want?

220
00:12:10,843 --> 00:12:12,868
Not you, you answer!

221
00:12:14,914 --> 00:12:16,541
I would say, sacrifice!

222
00:12:17,183 --> 00:12:18,844
When does love lose faith?

223
00:12:19,852 --> 00:12:21,979
When... you have to lie.

224
00:12:22,955 --> 00:12:24,855
What does a person love

225
00:12:25,024 --> 00:12:26,582
The heart or beauty!

226
00:12:28,461 --> 00:12:30,588
The soul, which does not die.

227
00:12:31,297 --> 00:12:32,525
How much will you love me?

228
00:12:35,535 --> 00:12:37,298
Me! He is the one to get married...

229
00:12:37,603 --> 00:12:40,572
I know! How much will
you love your wife?

230
00:12:42,175 --> 00:12:43,472
More than my life.

231
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:45,407
I am very pampered.

232
00:12:46,612 --> 00:12:48,603
I am used to living
in posh bungalows.

233
00:12:48,981 --> 00:12:50,278
Where will you keep
me after marriage?

234
00:12:52,285 --> 00:12:53,343
In my heart.

235
00:12:54,454 --> 00:12:55,512
Will you marry me?

236
00:12:56,089 --> 00:12:57,613
I want to marry you.

237
00:13:05,331 --> 00:13:06,389
One second!

238
00:13:06,566 --> 00:13:09,330
Sorry! - I...
- Yeah!

239
00:13:11,637 --> 00:13:12,934
Sir! Sir!

240
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,298
What happened sir?

241
00:13:17,343 --> 00:13:20,210
I was thinking... about my marriage!

242
00:13:21,914 --> 00:13:24,439
Tell me about it as you think,
it will be really enjoyable.

243
00:13:24,584 --> 00:13:28,918
Because you got married,
but I was ruined sir.

244
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:39,261
Hello!
- Who is this?

245
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:41,661
This is Shivani speaking,
who is speaking?

246
00:13:41,934 --> 00:13:44,266
This is Shanti speaking, give
the phone to Mr. Santosh!

247
00:13:44,537 --> 00:13:46,004
Sister-in-law Shanti! - One second!

248
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:48,300
Mr. Mishra, call for Mr. Santosh!

249
00:13:48,608 --> 00:13:49,666
Shanti sister-in-law on line!

250
00:13:50,343 --> 00:13:54,109
Listening to you I mustered
the courage to get married.

251
00:13:56,582 --> 00:13:57,981
But then I realised.

252
00:13:58,518 --> 00:14:02,284
It is not what it seems like.

253
00:14:02,688 --> 00:14:06,089
You are not like me Santosh.
- No I am not sir.

254
00:14:06,459 --> 00:14:08,689
You don't know how to
control your wife.

255
00:14:09,061 --> 00:14:11,222
You are talking about the wife.

256
00:14:12,265 --> 00:14:14,358
After marriage, my life
is not in control!

257
00:14:14,634 --> 00:14:15,692
Sister-in-law is calling.

258
00:14:17,203 --> 00:14:19,967
Mr. Prem, you are mistaken Mr.
Santosh Singh you are taken.

259
00:14:20,206 --> 00:14:21,366
On the mobile kept on the table.

260
00:14:22,074 --> 00:14:24,338
See sir, speak of the
devil and it appears.

261
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:26,643
Go, go argue...

262
00:14:27,046 --> 00:14:28,707
Talk to her!
- Yes sir.

263
00:14:29,982 --> 00:14:31,677
What did you say? Whom
did you call the devil?

264
00:14:31,984 --> 00:14:33,042
I didn't say anything.

265
00:14:33,119 --> 00:14:34,177
I am telling you, keep your
house matters at home...

266
00:14:34,253 --> 00:14:35,311
...and concentrate on
work in the office.

267
00:14:35,521 --> 00:14:38,718
Otherwise both of them get mixed up!

268
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:39,985
Listen, a poet has said.

269
00:14:40,059 --> 00:14:41,117
Listen, I am talking to you.

270
00:14:42,128 --> 00:14:43,186
What happened?

271
00:14:43,296 --> 00:14:46,322
Singh sir! What do I address you as?

272
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:47,457
Mr. Mishra.

273
00:14:47,533 --> 00:14:48,727
Then how should you address me?

274
00:14:49,435 --> 00:14:50,663
Singh Sir.

275
00:14:50,736 --> 00:14:52,601
Please Mr. Mishra, please
do your work. Please.

276
00:14:53,739 --> 00:14:55,001
Just see this application

277
00:14:55,074 --> 00:14:56,541
See.
- Yeah! - Hello!

278
00:14:56,742 --> 00:14:58,141
Why is your mobile switched off?

279
00:14:59,178 --> 00:15:02,113
Ok. - I come to work in the
bank and not to enjoy.

280
00:15:02,648 --> 00:15:04,172
And I know why you have called.

281
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,740
There is no need to say sorry.

282
00:15:05,818 --> 00:15:07,080
I didn't call to say sorry!

283
00:15:07,153 --> 00:15:08,211
You argued with me in
the morning and left...

284
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,345
...with the empty lunch box!

285
00:15:09,422 --> 00:15:11,014
You left the food here at home!

286
00:15:13,392 --> 00:15:14,757
Have you finished your
work Shivani? - Yes.

287
00:15:15,428 --> 00:15:16,554
Then go.
- Ok.

288
00:15:21,534 --> 00:15:23,729
Yes. Couldn't you remind me about
the lunch box in the morning?

289
00:15:24,203 --> 00:15:25,761
You want me to remain
hungry all day.

290
00:15:26,038 --> 00:15:27,562
I am regret marrying you!

291
00:15:27,707 --> 00:15:28,765
Who asked you to marry me?

292
00:15:28,841 --> 00:15:30,172
I was very unfortunate.

293
00:15:30,243 --> 00:15:32,268
Then why are you ruining my fate.

294
00:15:32,345 --> 00:15:35,143
Forget it! You can never
find a girl like me.

295
00:15:35,414 --> 00:15:36,711
One is enough!

296
00:15:37,617 --> 00:15:39,141
You have made my life hell!

297
00:15:39,385 --> 00:15:40,443
Me or you!

298
00:15:40,553 --> 00:15:42,077
Shanti! Shanti! Shanti!

299
00:15:42,588 --> 00:15:44,180
I know my name very well!

300
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:47,450
Even I know you name!

301
00:15:47,793 --> 00:15:49,784
I am asking you to keep quiet!

302
00:15:51,063 --> 00:15:53,793
This is the bank, I will talk to you
when I return in the evening. Okay!

303
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:03,599
Are you a spinster?

304
00:16:03,676 --> 00:16:05,200
Do your work! Don't concentrate
on other things. Okay!

305
00:16:06,212 --> 00:16:07,611
God knows whose solace
you will ruin!

306
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,079
He is taking his wife's
frustration out on me!

307
00:16:15,554 --> 00:16:17,249
I will marry a boy from Mumbai?

308
00:16:17,323 --> 00:16:18,517
Why?

309
00:16:18,591 --> 00:16:20,252
What is so special about Mumbai?

310
00:16:20,326 --> 00:16:22,226
Mumbai is my dream city!

311
00:16:22,295 --> 00:16:24,593
I have been dreaming about
Mumbai since my childhood.

312
00:16:25,231 --> 00:16:27,165
The lifestyle there is so different.

313
00:16:27,233 --> 00:16:29,098
And the women there don't
cook food at home.

314
00:16:29,168 --> 00:16:30,226
Then?

315
00:16:30,303 --> 00:16:34,706
People there live their life eating
burger, pizza and sandwich!

316
00:16:35,174 --> 00:16:37,108
And then, every evening they
go to the Juhu beach...

317
00:16:37,176 --> 00:16:38,837
...and have fried snacks.

318
00:16:39,111 --> 00:16:40,544
And then cinema.

319
00:16:40,613 --> 00:16:44,105
And then food, every Sunday a picnic!

320
00:16:45,117 --> 00:16:46,744
Even I want to lead a life like this.

321
00:16:47,119 --> 00:16:49,110
So, do you have anyone in sight...

322
00:16:49,188 --> 00:16:50,246
...or are you still
searching for him.

323
00:16:50,323 --> 00:16:53,292
I have found him, but in my dreams.

324
00:16:54,126 --> 00:16:57,118
But I am sure, one day he will
come out of my dreams...

325
00:16:57,196 --> 00:16:59,858
...and enter my life.

326
00:17:29,795 --> 00:17:33,822
Come out of the dreams.

327
00:17:34,834 --> 00:17:38,827
Come walking on the sky.

328
00:17:39,372 --> 00:17:43,741
Life is so colourless.

329
00:17:44,443 --> 00:17:48,539
Come and fill my
life with colours.

330
00:17:48,848 --> 00:17:51,248
I am waiting for you.

331
00:17:51,317 --> 00:17:53,842
I love you!

332
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,353
I am waiting for you.

333
00:17:56,422 --> 00:17:59,186
I love you!

334
00:17:59,258 --> 00:18:02,853
My heart is restless for you!

335
00:18:04,363 --> 00:18:08,629
Come out of the dreams.

336
00:18:09,335 --> 00:18:13,465
Come walking on the sky.

337
00:18:26,352 --> 00:18:31,415
My heart understands your passion!

338
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:35,654
It attracts me towards you.

339
00:18:36,328 --> 00:18:44,292
My heart beats are
crazy about you!

340
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:49,537
Without you my beloved,
I don't want to live.

341
00:18:49,608 --> 00:18:54,511
Without you my beloved,
I don't want to live.

342
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:58,539
My heart is restless for you.

343
00:19:00,252 --> 00:19:04,313
Come out of the dreams.

344
00:19:05,257 --> 00:19:09,318
Come walking on the sky.

345
00:19:30,783 --> 00:19:39,350
All day and night I crave for you!

346
00:19:40,693 --> 00:19:48,464
The intoxication of you
desires doesn't lessen!

347
00:19:48,901 --> 00:19:51,495
I have a thousand wishes!

348
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:53,902
I sacrifice everything for you!

349
00:19:53,973 --> 00:19:56,373
I have a thousand wishes!

350
00:19:56,442 --> 00:19:58,910
I sacrifice everything for you!

351
00:19:58,978 --> 00:20:03,438
My heart is restless for you.

352
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:08,386
Come out of the dreams.

353
00:20:09,388 --> 00:20:14,485
Come walking on the sky.

354
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:18,963
Life is so colourless.

355
00:20:19,031 --> 00:20:23,661
Come and fill my
life with colours.

356
00:20:23,736 --> 00:20:25,931
I am waiting for you.

357
00:20:26,005 --> 00:20:28,530
I love you!

358
00:20:28,607 --> 00:20:30,973
I am waiting for you.

359
00:20:31,043 --> 00:20:33,511
I love you!

360
00:20:33,579 --> 00:20:37,481
My heart is restless for you!

361
00:20:39,351 --> 00:20:43,788
Come out of the dreams.

362
00:20:43,856 --> 00:20:48,657
Come walking on the sky.

363
00:20:48,727 --> 00:20:51,787
Come! Come!

364
00:20:56,769 --> 00:20:59,431
'What had I thought, and
what has happened? '

365
00:21:00,506 --> 00:21:04,374
'Lf I had known, that after
marriage I would have to sit at home...

366
00:21:04,443 --> 00:21:05,705
...then I would have never got... '

367
00:21:05,778 --> 00:21:07,541
Good morning, good morning!
- Good morning Shanti.

368
00:21:07,613 --> 00:21:08,705
Good morning, come.

369
00:21:08,781 --> 00:21:10,373
What is the matter, you
are looking tensed.

370
00:21:10,449 --> 00:21:11,780
You had left the door open too.

371
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:14,751
Shanti, a person should
always remain happy.

372
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,447
Always remain happy, like us.

373
00:21:16,522 --> 00:21:18,456
I am not fortunate enough
to receive such happiness.

374
00:21:18,524 --> 00:21:19,650
Sit, sit.

375
00:21:21,393 --> 00:21:23,122
You are speaking dialogues
like Anarkali!

376
00:21:23,696 --> 00:21:25,391
You are a modern woman.

377
00:21:25,464 --> 00:21:28,399
You shouldn't cry, you should
face the problem.

378
00:21:28,467 --> 00:21:29,991
What is the matter Shanti?

379
00:21:30,069 --> 00:21:31,661
Did you both have an argument again?

380
00:21:31,737 --> 00:21:34,467
Nothing! He argues with me in the
morning over a small thing...

381
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,064
...and took with him
the empty lunch box!

382
00:21:36,141 --> 00:21:38,041
I called at the office
to tell him about it...

383
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:39,543
...and he started scolding
me instead.

384
00:21:39,612 --> 00:21:41,910
It is your mistake.
- No, it is Santosh's!

385
00:21:41,981 --> 00:21:43,744
Sorry, sorry of course
it is Santosh's fault.

386
00:21:43,816 --> 00:21:45,044
You are right.

387
00:21:45,751 --> 00:21:47,719
You both understand
each other so well.

388
00:21:47,786 --> 00:21:49,617
It has been only 6 months
to your marriage...

389
00:21:49,688 --> 00:21:51,485
...and you have argues so many times!

390
00:21:51,557 --> 00:21:53,149
I don't, he does.

391
00:21:53,225 --> 00:21:54,419
That's the problem, instead
finding faults with others...

392
00:21:54,493 --> 00:21:57,053
...if you point out your faults.

393
00:21:57,129 --> 00:21:58,596
Then all the misconceptions
will be cleared.

394
00:22:02,101 --> 00:22:03,864
He has gone with an empty lunch box.

395
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:05,628
Where will he have lunch?

396
00:22:08,507 --> 00:22:09,667
Do you want to order a mocktail?

397
00:22:11,677 --> 00:22:12,939
What are you ordering sir?

398
00:22:13,012 --> 00:22:14,445
Let's have the regular.
- Yes sir.

399
00:22:14,513 --> 00:22:16,447
Lucy, three lunches regular.
- Okay sir.

400
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:19,779
And get something special
for Santosh!

401
00:22:19,852 --> 00:22:21,183
He is having lunch with us today.

402
00:22:22,121 --> 00:22:23,452
Whenever you have a fight
with your wife...

403
00:22:23,522 --> 00:22:24,887
...you can have lunch
with us, don't worry.

404
00:22:24,957 --> 00:22:26,822
That's why I say Santosh!

405
00:22:26,892 --> 00:22:28,450
Don't get married.

406
00:22:28,527 --> 00:22:32,463
It is foolishness to buy the entire
cow, for a glass of milk.

407
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:38,463
I have married Shanti, Vicky!

408
00:22:38,537 --> 00:22:39,595
Mind your language.

409
00:22:39,672 --> 00:22:41,071
Even I am married.

410
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,732
But I don't cry like him.

411
00:22:42,808 --> 00:22:44,537
Really sir.

412
00:22:45,744 --> 00:22:47,211
Then why do you eat
at the hotel sir.

413
00:22:47,646 --> 00:22:49,477
Doesn't your wife cook food?

414
00:22:50,549 --> 00:22:52,676
Why do you utter nonsense?

415
00:22:52,751 --> 00:22:53,877
No sir, I don't utter nonsense.

416
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:55,078
Of course my wife cooks food!

417
00:22:55,154 --> 00:22:56,621
Every girl does.

418
00:22:56,689 --> 00:23:00,489
And my wife cooks such nice food...

419
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:05,553
...that I lick my fingers
while eating it!

420
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:10,235
This is lentil, this is potato and
cauliflower, rice and sweets!

421
00:23:11,503 --> 00:23:13,835
O my God!
- What happened

422
00:23:14,506 --> 00:23:16,701
You are really amazing!

423
00:23:16,775 --> 00:23:19,505
It is said, when you have
a loving husband...

424
00:23:19,578 --> 00:23:23,105
...any food the wife
cooks is very tasty!

425
00:23:27,052 --> 00:23:28,519
I love you sweetheart.

426
00:23:28,587 --> 00:23:30,054
Bread!

427
00:23:31,023 --> 00:23:32,115
Here!

428
00:23:45,704 --> 00:23:46,864
What happened?

429
00:23:49,074 --> 00:23:50,132
What happened?

430
00:23:50,209 --> 00:23:51,267
It is not very spicy!

431
00:23:52,611 --> 00:23:53,737
Shall I bring green chilly?
- No!

432
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,705
There is magic in your
hands, sweetheart.

433
00:23:58,884 --> 00:24:00,545
You cook so nice.

434
00:24:02,554 --> 00:24:06,684
No wife would have ever cooked
such good food for her husband.

435
00:24:08,093 --> 00:24:09,685
So sweet, thank you!

436
00:24:09,762 --> 00:24:10,854
I will taste it too.

437
00:24:10,929 --> 00:24:13,159
No, no.
- What happened?

438
00:24:14,133 --> 00:24:15,566
You have cooked very less!

439
00:24:15,634 --> 00:24:16,692
It won't be adequate for me.

440
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:19,738
I am just tasting it fool!

441
00:24:30,983 --> 00:24:32,143
Prem, water.

442
00:24:42,261 --> 00:24:45,321
Liar! You lied to me!

443
00:24:45,664 --> 00:24:47,598
You said this food is tasty!

444
00:24:49,067 --> 00:24:52,059
I didn't want to break your heart!

445
00:24:52,337 --> 00:24:54,328
Shut up! You don't love me!

446
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,607
If you would have loved me...

447
00:24:56,675 --> 00:24:59,269
...then the food that I cooked
would have been tasty!

448
00:24:59,745 --> 00:25:01,235
Fool, idiot!

449
00:25:01,613 --> 00:25:05,014
But... the food is very tasty!

450
00:25:05,684 --> 00:25:06,742
Then why don't you eat?

451
00:25:07,619 --> 00:25:08,677
Here, have this.

452
00:25:10,889 --> 00:25:11,947
What happened sir?

453
00:25:12,024 --> 00:25:13,821
Vicky, give sir water.

454
00:25:20,032 --> 00:25:21,090
What happened sir?

455
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,758
Yummy!

456
00:25:23,635 --> 00:25:24,829
Yummy! - Mummy!

457
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:28,098
I was tasting my wife's cooking.

458
00:25:29,241 --> 00:25:30,902
That's what happens
with married people.

459
00:25:31,043 --> 00:25:32,908
They are always lost in the
thought of their wife!

460
00:25:32,978 --> 00:25:34,639
That's why I don't get
in these problems.

461
00:25:34,713 --> 00:25:35,771
You will get married some time.

462
00:25:35,848 --> 00:25:38,373
I am married without getting
married Santosh!

463
00:25:38,717 --> 00:25:40,309
Imagine! Imagine!

464
00:25:40,385 --> 00:25:42,046
How can I imagine?

465
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,712
What does a blind man want?
- A stick!

466
00:25:44,323 --> 00:25:46,120
Eyes, fool eyes!

467
00:25:46,191 --> 00:25:47,852
But who is the blind person?

468
00:25:48,327 --> 00:25:49,726
He is talking about himself!

469
00:25:49,795 --> 00:25:51,990
But he is not blind.
- When did he say that he is blind?

470
00:25:52,064 --> 00:25:54,123
Just a while ago. He
said he is blind.

471
00:25:54,199 --> 00:25:55,996
Idiom!

472
00:25:56,068 --> 00:25:58,127
I know sir idiom, meaning phrases.

473
00:25:58,203 --> 00:25:59,670
So he is using idioms!

474
00:25:59,738 --> 00:26:01,069
Since when did you
start using idioms!

475
00:26:01,139 --> 00:26:02,333
He is saying, he has
been blinded by love.

476
00:26:02,407 --> 00:26:03,669
Explain him!

477
00:26:03,742 --> 00:26:06,939
Since Twinkle has entered
my life, I have changed.

478
00:26:08,213 --> 00:26:09,271
How is that?

479
00:26:09,348 --> 00:26:10,679
Twinkle and I love each
other very much...

480
00:26:10,749 --> 00:26:12,148
...but we share everything half-half!

481
00:26:12,351 --> 00:26:15,149
The rent of the house, expenditure.

482
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:16,687
The bedroom!
- Half-half!

483
00:26:16,755 --> 00:26:18,279
Full!

484
00:26:19,291 --> 00:26:21,885
In a live-in relationship, the
girlfriend is your wife.

485
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,752
What fun, isn't it?
- What fun sir!

486
00:26:23,829 --> 00:26:24,887
Without marriage!

487
00:26:24,963 --> 00:26:27,227
Without marriage, without
interference!

488
00:26:27,299 --> 00:26:29,028
Without interference
from the girls side...

489
00:26:29,167 --> 00:26:31,294
...or interference
from the boys side.

490
00:26:31,703 --> 00:26:32,761
What fun!

491
00:26:32,838 --> 00:26:34,100
Imagine Santosh, that's
what my life is!

492
00:26:34,239 --> 00:26:36,969
Surprising, where has your
imagination taken you!

493
00:26:37,442 --> 00:26:39,706
You both sleep together
in the same bedroom!

494
00:26:39,778 --> 00:26:41,302
And you have still not
understood each other!

495
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,711
When will you do it?

496
00:26:42,781 --> 00:26:44,772
A year, two years it could
take 3 years too!

497
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:46,112
What if you couldn't understand
each other?

498
00:26:46,184 --> 00:26:48,118
Then Vickie will find
another Twinkle...

499
00:26:48,186 --> 00:26:49,710
...and Twinkle will find
another Vickie!

500
00:26:49,788 --> 00:26:51,050
Change!

501
00:26:51,123 --> 00:26:52,920
That's the fun in live-in
relationship!

502
00:26:53,191 --> 00:26:55,455
Vickie, does Twinkle love you?

503
00:26:55,727 --> 00:26:57,786
Of course she loves me.

504
00:26:58,130 --> 00:26:59,392
She is coming to meet
me in the evening.

505
00:26:59,464 --> 00:27:00,726
See it for yourself!

506
00:27:11,076 --> 00:27:12,168
There comes my gal!

507
00:27:12,477 --> 00:27:14,342
Then who is Twinkle?

508
00:27:16,748 --> 00:27:17,806
Hi Vickie, let's go!

509
00:27:17,883 --> 00:27:20,215
Just a minute, meet my colleague!
He is Santosh!

510
00:27:20,419 --> 00:27:21,477
Hello. - Greetings sister-in-law!

511
00:27:21,753 --> 00:27:23,948
What, do I look like
sister-in-law to you?

512
00:27:25,223 --> 00:27:26,281
What else can I call you?

513
00:27:26,358 --> 00:27:28,485
I called you sister-in-law,
he was calling you gal.

514
00:27:28,827 --> 00:27:31,819
Gal! - Actually,
I was praising you darling.

515
00:27:31,897 --> 00:27:33,762
He is very disturbed,
he says whatever he feels like.

516
00:27:33,832 --> 00:27:35,026
Disturbed, you called her a gal.

517
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,364
Disturbed! Are you married?

518
00:27:39,171 --> 00:27:41,298
Do I look like a married
person from my face!

519
00:27:41,506 --> 00:27:44,907
Yes! Because the life of a married
person is like yours.

520
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:47,978
Anyways, Vickie come on Darling,
we are getting late.

521
00:27:48,046 --> 00:27:49,980
Come on, come on.

522
00:27:50,515 --> 00:27:52,176
Imagine Santosh, imagine.

523
00:27:53,318 --> 00:27:55,786
Bye.
- Bye, have a nice day Santosh!

524
00:28:01,927 --> 00:28:04,794
His imagination took
him so far ahead!

525
00:28:05,998 --> 00:28:08,796
My life is really ruined.

526
00:28:27,219 --> 00:28:28,277
Take a look at the poster!

527
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,887
It is a really nice play.

528
00:28:29,955 --> 00:28:31,820
We'll have fun.

529
00:28:34,292 --> 00:28:35,350
I am sorry.

530
00:28:35,894 --> 00:28:36,952
How are you sir?

531
00:28:37,029 --> 00:28:38,155
What are you doing here sir?

532
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:39,492
I had come...

533
00:28:46,838 --> 00:28:48,897
Sir, this is my friend Twinkle.

534
00:28:49,908 --> 00:28:51,967
Hi Twinkle. Nice to meet you. Hi.

535
00:28:52,044 --> 00:28:53,102
I am Prem!

536
00:28:53,979 --> 00:28:56,311
Sir... he is the bank manager.

537
00:28:56,381 --> 00:28:57,905
And he is a servant in that bank.

538
00:28:58,183 --> 00:29:00,583
Sir, we both love each other.

539
00:29:02,854 --> 00:29:04,981
Does this mean you guys are having
a live-in relationship?

540
00:29:05,057 --> 00:29:06,524
Of course.

541
00:29:06,591 --> 00:29:07,853
That's lovely.

542
00:29:07,926 --> 00:29:09,860
I like modern girls that
change her thoughts...

543
00:29:09,928 --> 00:29:12,920
...and along with that,
her boyfriends too!

544
00:29:13,065 --> 00:29:14,532
You remember!

545
00:29:14,599 --> 00:29:18,000
By the way, I already had
3 boyfriends before Santosh!

546
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:19,128
What? I am the 4th!

547
00:29:19,404 --> 00:29:20,928
And I will be the 5th one!

548
00:29:21,006 --> 00:29:23,873
No, that cannot be.

549
00:29:23,942 --> 00:29:25,000
No compromise with the girl sir.

550
00:29:25,077 --> 00:29:27,341
By the way Santosh,
why isn't it possible?

551
00:29:27,412 --> 00:29:29,073
Please don't be so narrow minded!

552
00:29:29,147 --> 00:29:31,206
Please... - Narrow minded!
An open offer!

553
00:29:31,283 --> 00:29:32,341
Hi Twinkle!

554
00:29:32,417 --> 00:29:33,941
Hi Vickie, how are you?
- How are you?

555
00:29:34,553 --> 00:29:35,952
I am great!
What are you doing here?

556
00:29:36,088 --> 00:29:40,422
Vickie, well meet my new boyfriend...
- I know him.

557
00:29:40,492 --> 00:29:42,221
So, you are the new boyfriend.

558
00:29:42,294 --> 00:29:43,352
Do you have any problem?

559
00:29:43,428 --> 00:29:44,486
Stand properly!

560
00:29:44,563 --> 00:29:46,155
Why would I have a problem?
I am the Ex.

561
00:29:46,364 --> 00:29:47,956
After X comes Y.

562
00:29:48,166 --> 00:29:49,895
And after Y comes Z!

563
00:29:49,968 --> 00:29:51,959
I am the Z one.
Oh, so you are after him.

564
00:29:52,037 --> 00:29:53,095
How nice sir.

565
00:29:53,638 --> 00:29:56,163
She is not an offering
to be distributed.

566
00:29:56,241 --> 00:29:57,435
I am the last one.

567
00:29:57,509 --> 00:29:59,909
Come on dear. Let's go! Okay bye.

568
00:29:59,978 --> 00:30:01,377
We will meet in the office. Go, go.

569
00:30:01,446 --> 00:30:03,107
I will come with my new girlfriend.

570
00:30:03,181 --> 00:30:04,239
You have already enticed someone!

571
00:30:04,649 --> 00:30:06,241
Now, it's my turn.

572
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:08,177
Okay!

573
00:30:09,121 --> 00:30:10,179
Good!

574
00:30:11,256 --> 00:30:12,314
What would you like to have?

575
00:30:12,924 --> 00:30:14,516
I don't mind, anything.

576
00:30:14,926 --> 00:30:15,984
Me too! Me too!

577
00:30:16,061 --> 00:30:18,120
Then go and get something
for all of us!

578
00:30:18,196 --> 00:30:19,993
Tell him what you want,
he will get it.

579
00:30:20,398 --> 00:30:21,456
Yes. - Popcorn.

580
00:30:21,666 --> 00:30:23,133
Popcorn for me as well.

581
00:30:23,401 --> 00:30:24,993
And cola?
- Yeah cola.

582
00:30:25,537 --> 00:30:26,595
Okay.

583
00:30:26,671 --> 00:30:27,933
Thank God!

584
00:30:28,006 --> 00:30:29,234
He is taking advantage
of his friend.

585
00:30:30,142 --> 00:30:31,939
He is a very cunning man.

586
00:30:33,011 --> 00:30:34,410
Give me two popcorns.

587
00:30:34,546 --> 00:30:37,140
Shame. - Hail Khurana sir.

588
00:30:37,215 --> 00:30:38,273
Hail Khurana sir.

589
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:40,147
It is such a wrong thing.
Eating popcorn is wrong.

590
00:30:40,218 --> 00:30:41,617
Eating popcorn is not wrong.

591
00:30:41,686 --> 00:30:42,948
But leaving wife along at home...

592
00:30:43,021 --> 00:30:45,615
...watching this play alone is wrong.

593
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:47,214
I came out in a fit of rage.

594
00:30:47,425 --> 00:30:48,483
What?

595
00:30:51,429 --> 00:30:53,158
Why didn't he bring
the popcorn till now?

596
00:30:53,565 --> 00:30:55,965
Santosh, where are they?
- Who?

597
00:30:56,168 --> 00:30:59,501
They both!
- Them, I don't know them.

598
00:30:59,571 --> 00:31:01,300
I just met them!

599
00:31:01,373 --> 00:31:03,102
I am a respected man, I don't...

600
00:31:03,175 --> 00:31:04,972
I don't go out with anyone
else other than my wife.

601
00:31:05,043 --> 00:31:06,101
Isn't it Khurana sir?

602
00:31:06,178 --> 00:31:08,373
Say yes!
- Yes.

603
00:31:08,446 --> 00:31:10,505
Really! And Prem sir and...
- Who else?

604
00:31:10,582 --> 00:31:11,640
Your new girlfriend.

605
00:31:13,385 --> 00:31:16,047
How many times have I told you
to get your ailment treated?

606
00:31:16,121 --> 00:31:17,383
You just utter anything anywhere.

607
00:31:17,455 --> 00:31:18,513
Twinkle!

608
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:21,184
Hey fool.
- They are thrashing Vickie!

609
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:24,585
It happens everyday.

610
00:31:24,996 --> 00:31:26,054
Let it be.

611
00:31:26,131 --> 00:31:28,190
Don't you thing we shouldn't
we go and take a look.

612
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,458
We can see everything from here.

613
00:31:29,534 --> 00:31:32,059
He works in my bank, he has
an illness of forgetting things.

614
00:31:32,671 --> 00:31:33,729
Go!

615
00:31:34,005 --> 00:31:35,063
Poor guy. Come here!

616
00:31:35,207 --> 00:31:37,004
In which bank do you work?
- Oracle bank?

617
00:31:37,075 --> 00:31:38,201
Oracle Bank, he remembers
the name of the bank.

618
00:31:38,276 --> 00:31:41,268
He forgets that in front of me.
In which bank do you work?

619
00:31:41,346 --> 00:31:43,007
O... O...
- He forgot again!

620
00:31:43,081 --> 00:31:44,139
Have you come alone?

621
00:31:44,282 --> 00:31:47,547
Strange disease. No, no I have come
with your wife and my wife.

622
00:31:47,619 --> 00:31:48,677
My wife!

623
00:31:48,753 --> 00:31:50,015
She has come along with
us, sitting there!

624
00:31:51,623 --> 00:31:53,022
Santosh! Santosh!

625
00:31:53,091 --> 00:31:55,218
Stop it! Why do you keep arguing?

626
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,419
Sir, this is Khurana sir,
my neighbour!

627
00:31:57,495 --> 00:31:59,019
And this is Prem sir, our boss.

628
00:31:59,164 --> 00:32:00,290
And who is she?

629
00:32:00,432 --> 00:32:03,026
She... his fiance.

630
00:32:04,169 --> 00:32:07,104
Yes, she is my fiancee.

631
00:32:07,172 --> 00:32:09,037
When are you both getting married?

632
00:32:10,041 --> 00:32:11,099
Soon enough.

633
00:32:11,176 --> 00:32:12,234
How is that possible?

634
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:14,642
Since when do you know Twinkle?
Twinkle was my girlfriend!

635
00:32:14,779 --> 00:32:16,041
What nonsense are you talking?

636
00:32:16,181 --> 00:32:17,773
He has really lost his mind.

637
00:32:18,049 --> 00:32:19,710
I am not talking nonsense,
his wife is Khushi.

638
00:32:20,118 --> 00:32:23,053
You... you don't remember
anything without being slapped.

639
00:32:23,255 --> 00:32:25,246
Wife imparts happiness.

640
00:32:25,323 --> 00:32:27,052
That's why I am marrying her.

641
00:32:27,125 --> 00:32:28,456
But you are already married.

642
00:32:29,594 --> 00:32:30,652
You...

643
00:32:30,729 --> 00:32:32,060
I will get married.

644
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:33,188
I will!

645
00:32:33,665 --> 00:32:34,723
Go home now!

646
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,061
Go, go.

647
00:32:36,134 --> 00:32:37,192
Get yourself treated.

648
00:32:38,069 --> 00:32:39,127
Nice to meet you!

649
00:32:39,204 --> 00:32:42,332
Nice to meet you! Nice couple.

650
00:32:42,407 --> 00:32:45,069
But he is in the last stage of his
ailment. - Yes, I'll get him treated.

651
00:32:45,143 --> 00:32:48,271
Come on, let us watch
the play with Shanti.

652
00:32:48,346 --> 00:32:50,814
Can't you see me happy? Come on!

653
00:32:51,082 --> 00:32:55,075
If I see her now, my happiness will
turn into sorrows. Come on! Come on!

654
00:32:56,755 --> 00:32:57,813
What happened?

655
00:32:58,089 --> 00:32:59,147
Are you in your senses?

656
00:33:01,493 --> 00:33:02,551
What happened?

657
00:33:03,161 --> 00:33:07,564
Sir, I was imagining Vickie's life.

658
00:33:09,834 --> 00:33:11,096
That means, in your imagination...

659
00:33:11,169 --> 00:33:13,103
...you were living Vickie's life.

660
00:33:13,171 --> 00:33:14,229
Are you a sage or an ascetic?

661
00:33:14,306 --> 00:33:15,364
No sir.

662
00:33:17,709 --> 00:33:24,444
Sir, I thought I was the new
boyfriend of his girlfriend.

663
00:33:25,717 --> 00:33:26,775
What?

664
00:33:28,186 --> 00:33:29,244
Wait a second!

665
00:33:29,321 --> 00:33:31,118
That means, seeing me
you can imagine...

666
00:33:31,189 --> 00:33:32,588
...you are the husband of my wife.

667
00:33:32,657 --> 00:33:34,249
How can I imagine that sir?

668
00:33:34,326 --> 00:33:38,456
I can never imagine that ever sir!
You cheap! - Sir, sir! You cheap!

669
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:42,125
I never saw such a bad and
cheap person in my life.

670
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,134
Listen to me sir. - Get out! Go!

671
00:33:44,202 --> 00:33:47,137
Sir, I didn't even touch your
wife in my imagination.

672
00:33:47,272 --> 00:33:50,332
I don't even want to see your face.
Sir, your wife is my sister-in-law!

673
00:33:50,408 --> 00:33:52,205
Don't sit in my car. Get out!

674
00:33:52,277 --> 00:33:53,335
Sir!

675
00:33:57,349 --> 00:33:58,407
Surprising!

676
00:33:59,351 --> 00:34:01,876
I didn't even imagine his wife,
still he misunderstood me.

677
00:34:14,165 --> 00:34:15,223
Hi darling.

678
00:34:16,167 --> 00:34:19,227
Where are you? - In your heart.

679
00:34:20,305 --> 00:34:23,433
You liar!
- I mean it, take a peak.

680
00:34:23,708 --> 00:34:27,235
I don't have to peak in
my heart to see you!

681
00:34:28,313 --> 00:34:30,247
Love you!
- Really?

682
00:34:30,515 --> 00:34:31,846
Trust me sweetheart!

683
00:34:32,517 --> 00:34:36,647
What can you do for me?
- Anything.

684
00:34:37,188 --> 00:34:38,450
And what if I die?

685
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:41,181
Don't talk like that sweet heart!

686
00:34:41,259 --> 00:34:43,454
If you die, I will die too.

687
00:34:43,661 --> 00:34:46,459
Prem, I love you, I
love you, I love you!

688
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,730
Prem, you love me so much.

689
00:34:50,869 --> 00:34:53,269
Come home quickly.

690
00:34:53,605 --> 00:34:55,470
I will give you a very big surprise.

691
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:57,464
Okay. Bye.

692
00:35:01,279 --> 00:35:04,771
In this world every man is sad.

693
00:35:05,784 --> 00:35:08,651
Somebody has one sorrow.
Somebody the other.

694
00:35:09,287 --> 00:35:12,950
Sir. But sir, what
sorrow do you have?

695
00:35:13,491 --> 00:35:19,293
My wife is ill. She
can't move around.

696
00:35:19,364 --> 00:35:23,801
I've become a doctor by taking
her to doctors for treatment.

697
00:35:23,868 --> 00:35:25,563
Sir, don't get disheartened.

698
00:35:25,637 --> 00:35:27,571
You can tell me if
I can be any help for you.

699
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,637
Of course.
Give me a little happiness.

700
00:35:31,509 --> 00:35:32,942
For me to stay alive.

701
00:35:33,678 --> 00:35:34,906
All the men are the same.

702
00:35:35,647 --> 00:35:37,478
They lie to their secretary
and thus entice them.

703
00:35:37,849 --> 00:35:38,941
He too must be like this!

704
00:35:39,384 --> 00:35:40,715
So this training is going on!

705
00:35:40,852 --> 00:35:42,979
Watch the movies and
abuse your husbands!

706
00:35:43,688 --> 00:35:44,746
So you have come!
- Yes!

707
00:35:44,823 --> 00:35:46,415
I am not abusing you.
I am speaking the truth.

708
00:35:47,325 --> 00:35:49,987
Whenever I call at your office,
your secretary answers the phone.

709
00:35:50,061 --> 00:35:52,996
She is not my secretary.
I myself am the cashier.

710
00:35:53,331 --> 00:35:54,389
She answers the phone!

711
00:35:54,466 --> 00:35:55,524
Had she been your secretary,
you would have enticed her!

712
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,999
What entice her? I
myself am trapped!

713
00:35:57,335 --> 00:36:01,772
Mr. Khurana is right.
Men like to flirt.

714
00:36:02,407 --> 00:36:03,999
We should control them.

715
00:36:04,609 --> 00:36:06,338
I will have to sell his house!

716
00:36:06,411 --> 00:36:09,574
Khurana has made my life hell!

717
00:36:09,647 --> 00:36:13,276
Please don't listen to the
neighbours and fight with me!

718
00:36:14,419 --> 00:36:16,011
I am speaking the truth, that's
why you find it bitter.

719
00:36:16,087 --> 00:36:18,715
That's why you switched off
my TV! Return my remote!

720
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:20,655
What do you do the whole
day besides watching TV?

721
00:36:20,725 --> 00:36:22,352
Beware if you said anything
about the TV!

722
00:36:22,427 --> 00:36:23,758
My father gave me this!

723
00:36:23,828 --> 00:36:25,022
Father! My father!

724
00:36:25,096 --> 00:36:27,030
All the things which your
father gave are useless!

725
00:36:27,298 --> 00:36:28,356
Am I also useless?

726
00:36:28,433 --> 00:36:32,665
Yes! And be thankful that
a man like me married you!

727
00:36:33,371 --> 00:36:35,862
Stop it! I was receiving
so many nice alliances!

728
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,567
They all were lucky!
They all were saved!

729
00:36:37,842 --> 00:36:39,935
Drop it now! And return my remote!

730
00:36:40,011 --> 00:36:42,309
I wish there was a remote
which would have...

731
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:44,746
...changed wives instead of channels.

732
00:36:44,816 --> 00:36:45,874
What would you have done?

733
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:47,815
I would have changed
channels everyday.

734
00:36:47,886 --> 00:36:49,319
And I would have not looked
at any channel...

735
00:36:49,387 --> 00:36:52,049
...after watching it once.

736
00:36:52,123 --> 00:36:53,852
Right from the beginning
I knew you are like this!

737
00:36:53,925 --> 00:36:56,325
Yes! Right! I am like this!
And I will remain like this!

738
00:36:56,394 --> 00:36:58,055
I am like this! I am like this!

739
00:36:58,663 --> 00:37:00,062
Warm the food! I am hungry!

740
00:37:00,131 --> 00:37:03,066
I won't! Go and eat at that
female's house from your bank!

741
00:37:03,134 --> 00:37:04,624
And you can behave
like a joker there!

742
00:37:04,702 --> 00:37:07,500
Fine! I will eat it! Now
I will go and eat there!

743
00:37:07,672 --> 00:37:10,766
So go! Let me see how many
days she serves you meal!

744
00:37:10,842 --> 00:37:12,867
Someday you will have to
come back to me only!

745
00:37:14,879 --> 00:37:16,642
Am I mad to come back to hell?

746
00:37:16,714 --> 00:37:19,478
This is not hell! Wives
make the house heaven!

747
00:37:19,551 --> 00:37:22,076
And they kill their husband!
What is she saying!

748
00:37:22,554 --> 00:37:23,680
She starts as soon as
I enter the house!

749
00:37:23,755 --> 00:37:24,813
Where are you taking the keys?

750
00:37:24,889 --> 00:37:26,516
My father had given the car.

751
00:37:26,691 --> 00:37:29,091
This car is like you only.

752
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,094
After a few days sell it at
the junk shop for free!

753
00:37:31,362 --> 00:37:32,420
If you are such a self-made man...

754
00:37:32,497 --> 00:37:33,555
...then remove these clothes too!

755
00:37:33,631 --> 00:37:34,689
I am not going to become a sage!

756
00:37:34,766 --> 00:37:36,427
That I will remove my clothes
and roam naked on the street!

757
00:37:36,501 --> 00:37:39,095
My father gave this shirt
on last Diwali. Remove it!

758
00:37:42,574 --> 00:37:43,632
I see!

759
00:37:44,842 --> 00:37:47,436
Today I understood it's
a crime to accept dowry!

760
00:37:47,512 --> 00:37:49,878
Husband has to even become naked!

761
00:37:52,584 --> 00:37:54,108
Take! Give it to your father!

762
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:56,448
Father! Father has
made my life hell!

763
00:38:02,594 --> 00:38:05,859
Your father has not given
you this! Right?

764
00:38:06,397 --> 00:38:10,128
Now you stay with the dowry
given by your father.

765
00:38:10,468 --> 00:38:11,992
Tell the car to fill your
head with vermillion.

766
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:13,867
And tell the TV to
give you children!

767
00:38:14,005 --> 00:38:15,870
Fine! I am leaving!
- Stop!

768
00:38:16,741 --> 00:38:19,141
I won't forgive you!
No need to say sorry!

769
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:21,542
I am not saying sorry!
Give me my remote!

770
00:38:21,913 --> 00:38:24,143
Keep this! I am leaving!

771
00:38:25,483 --> 00:38:27,747
Leave! You just needed an excuse!

772
00:38:27,819 --> 00:38:29,480
You have kept me in this house!

773
00:38:29,554 --> 00:38:31,681
I have to entertain myself
by watching the TV!

774
00:38:33,091 --> 00:38:35,082
My TV is much better than you!

775
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,625
My life is miserable in the
office and in the house too!

776
00:38:37,695 --> 00:38:40,755
Santosh! Wait! Come here!
Come here! Come here!

777
00:38:40,832 --> 00:38:42,163
Where are you going?
- To kill flies!

778
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,161
Alone?
- Yes! Now you have come!

779
00:38:44,769 --> 00:38:47,135
No! I don't have time! I have
to meet my mother-in-law!

780
00:38:47,505 --> 00:38:50,065
Santosh, in the morning
you fought with Shanti!

781
00:38:50,141 --> 00:38:51,438
Have you both made up?

782
00:38:51,509 --> 00:38:53,500
Now you don't add insult to injury!

783
00:38:53,778 --> 00:38:56,679
You got me married and
you provoke her!

784
00:38:56,748 --> 00:38:59,512
Why am I going there?
- Santosh!

785
00:39:00,018 --> 00:39:01,713
I think the matter is serious!

786
00:39:01,786 --> 00:39:04,050
The matter is very serious,
Mr. Khurana! - Yes!

787
00:39:04,122 --> 00:39:06,056
Drop me to my mother's house.

788
00:39:06,124 --> 00:39:07,455
Then go and explain to Shanti.

789
00:39:07,525 --> 00:39:08,583
I?
- Yes!

790
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:10,184
I... fine!
- Please!

791
00:39:10,528 --> 00:39:11,688
Come!
- Come!

792
00:39:11,763 --> 00:39:13,526
I won't spare you both!

793
00:39:13,598 --> 00:39:14,656
Hey!

794
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:25,134
What is this? Lights off!

795
00:39:31,082 --> 00:39:32,208
The anniversary is tomorrow.

796
00:39:33,551 --> 00:39:36,543
And today this surprise! Cool!

797
00:39:37,221 --> 00:39:41,851
Khushi! Khushi, I know you are
playing with me! Khushi!

798
00:39:49,834 --> 00:39:50,892
O my God!

799
00:39:52,637 --> 00:39:55,970
Khushi! Khushi! Khushi!

800
00:39:56,841 --> 00:39:57,899
O God!

801
00:40:06,584 --> 00:40:08,245
Hello! Is Dr. Chandrashekhar there?

802
00:40:08,853 --> 00:40:10,081
Is Dr. Chandrashekhar there?

803
00:40:10,588 --> 00:40:11,714
Please call him quickly!

804
00:40:24,102 --> 00:40:25,160
Liar!

805
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:28,065
What?
- Cheater!

806
00:40:28,139 --> 00:40:30,266
You are fine! I was
calling the doctor!

807
00:40:30,341 --> 00:40:31,672
You scared the hell out of me!

808
00:40:31,743 --> 00:40:33,210
You don't love me!

809
00:40:33,878 --> 00:40:36,278
I was testing you by playing
the drama of dying.

810
00:40:37,148 --> 00:40:40,208
Now I am sure you don't love me.

811
00:40:40,284 --> 00:40:42,912
I love you, darling. I love you.

812
00:40:42,987 --> 00:40:46,548
Why didn't you die seeing
that I am dead? - What!

813
00:40:47,125 --> 00:40:49,286
What are you saying? Are you okay?

814
00:40:53,631 --> 00:40:57,863
Isn't this what you had said? If
you died, then I too will die!

815
00:40:58,903 --> 00:41:04,068
Oh! But you are not dead!
You are alive!

816
00:41:04,642 --> 00:41:06,735
Now you found out that I am alive!

817
00:41:11,149 --> 00:41:13,310
Get lost! I won't talk to you!

818
00:41:14,185 --> 00:41:15,584
Before marriage you used to say...

819
00:41:15,653 --> 00:41:18,315
...that love spans across lifetimes.

820
00:41:19,223 --> 00:41:21,987
I died and you are alive.

821
00:41:22,927 --> 00:41:25,657
I was trying to save you!

822
00:41:27,265 --> 00:41:28,596
Before marriage why
did you say that...

823
00:41:28,666 --> 00:41:30,998
...you will love me more
than your life!

824
00:41:33,204 --> 00:41:37,300
Now I came to know that you
love your life more than me!

825
00:41:38,676 --> 00:41:41,736
Seriously, Khushi!
I can die for you!

826
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,340
Shall I die for you?

827
00:41:43,681 --> 00:41:47,811
Why are you saying this? Take! Die!

828
00:41:50,221 --> 00:41:52,086
My life has become hell!

829
00:41:52,156 --> 00:41:54,920
All this happened because of Mr.
Khurana and brother-in-law!

830
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:58,758
How they praised her! That
Shanti is so gentle!

831
00:41:59,831 --> 00:42:02,857
I was a fool! I am in a bad plight!

832
00:42:05,703 --> 00:42:08,695
What happened? Any problem?

833
00:42:08,773 --> 00:42:10,035
Are sweets being distributed?
Go and do your work!

834
00:42:10,107 --> 00:42:11,369
Why are you yelling?

835
00:42:13,711 --> 00:42:14,769
They were praising her so much!

836
00:42:14,846 --> 00:42:15,972
They were saying that...

837
00:42:16,047 --> 00:42:17,378
...Santosh, we have found
a heroine for you!

838
00:42:26,123 --> 00:42:27,215
She is like a heroine!

839
00:42:27,291 --> 00:42:29,054
Our Santosh too is not any less!

840
00:42:29,126 --> 00:42:32,254
He doesn't use his tongue.
He uses his hand.

841
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,970
What are you saying? When
do I use my hands?

842
00:42:45,743 --> 00:42:49,201
You are a cashier in the bank.
You use only your hand.

843
00:42:54,752 --> 00:42:55,810
He has been living in
our neighbourhood...

844
00:42:55,887 --> 00:42:56,945
...for the past 6 years.

845
00:42:57,021 --> 00:42:58,352
He is a decent man.

846
00:42:59,023 --> 00:43:01,082
Nowadays you don't find such guys.

847
00:43:01,158 --> 00:43:05,356
Actually Santosh likes
to drink and eat.

848
00:43:08,232 --> 00:43:09,859
What? What are you saying?

849
00:43:09,934 --> 00:43:12,164
Have you come to get me
married or to ruin me?

850
00:43:12,236 --> 00:43:14,704
I am saying that you
are a healthy man.

851
00:43:14,772 --> 00:43:15,830
Am I saying anything wrong?

852
00:43:16,774 --> 00:43:18,071
I do eat and drink.

853
00:43:19,777 --> 00:43:22,075
Mr. Khurana, that's really good!

854
00:43:22,146 --> 00:43:23,443
Whether you agree or not!

855
00:43:23,781 --> 00:43:26,443
Even our daughter loves
to eat and drink!

856
00:43:27,051 --> 00:43:31,385
Then this match is perfect.
We accept this alliance.

857
00:43:31,789 --> 00:43:32,847
Am I right, Mr. Khurana?

858
00:43:32,924 --> 00:43:34,016
Yes, yes!

859
00:43:34,392 --> 00:43:37,953
What yes? I have still
not seen the girl.

860
00:43:38,796 --> 00:43:40,457
Mrs. Khurana has seen the girl.

861
00:43:40,798 --> 00:43:42,095
Her choice can't be wrong!

862
00:43:48,806 --> 00:43:49,864
What's the matter?

863
00:43:51,075 --> 00:43:53,805
I didn't see the girl's face. We
have to come to see the girl.

864
00:43:54,312 --> 00:43:57,110
Santosh, in villages the
girl is not shown.

865
00:43:57,181 --> 00:43:59,308
Only her photo is shown.
Do you understand?

866
00:43:59,383 --> 00:44:01,317
Then they should have sent her
snap. - Why did they call me?

867
00:44:01,385 --> 00:44:03,819
They wanted to see you.

868
00:44:03,888 --> 00:44:05,480
Me? Am I a blind, deaf
or a crippled man?

869
00:44:05,556 --> 00:44:06,818
That they wanted to see me!

870
00:44:07,825 --> 00:44:08,883
What if there is some
flaw in the girl?

871
00:44:10,328 --> 00:44:12,489
Nothing like this will happen!
- Will I marry you?

872
00:44:13,097 --> 00:44:14,758
I am a married man!
My wife is there!

873
00:44:14,832 --> 00:44:16,459
I know!
- I said this won't happen!

874
00:44:17,101 --> 00:44:18,762
Mr. Khurana, whether
you agree or not...

875
00:44:18,836 --> 00:44:20,770
...my daughter is so sensible
that she won't give...

876
00:44:20,838 --> 00:44:23,272
...you all a chance to complain.

877
00:44:23,774 --> 00:44:26,265
She is so gentle.
- Gentle.

878
00:44:26,344 --> 00:44:28,005
So shall we fix the alliance?
- Yes!

879
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:29,137
Congratulations!

880
00:44:29,213 --> 00:44:30,271
Can she talk?

881
00:44:30,348 --> 00:44:31,508
Have sweets!

882
00:44:31,849 --> 00:44:33,214
I mean...
- Open your mouth!

883
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:38,520
I eat such a sweet... that it
made my mouth bitter forever.

884
00:44:39,056 --> 00:44:41,490
It's all Mr. Khurana's doing!

885
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:44,794
Seeing those old people's love...

886
00:44:44,862 --> 00:44:46,090
...why did I got fooled?

887
00:44:46,864 --> 00:44:48,798
God, why have You made husband...

888
00:44:48,866 --> 00:44:50,527
...and wife's relationship?

889
00:44:53,371 --> 00:44:56,067
I will call her father!

890
00:44:57,875 --> 00:44:59,502
Hello! Who is that?

891
00:44:59,577 --> 00:45:01,477
I have forgotten who I am!

892
00:45:01,879 --> 00:45:04,814
Before marriage my parents
had named me Santosh.

893
00:45:04,882 --> 00:45:06,008
This is what I remember!

894
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:10,416
Son-in-law, great! You have
a long life! - Is that so?

895
00:45:10,488 --> 00:45:13,013
You will live for 200 years! We
were talking about you only!

896
00:45:13,090 --> 00:45:14,421
Is 10-20 years not enough!

897
00:45:14,492 --> 00:45:16,551
That you will torture
me for 200 years!

898
00:45:18,462 --> 00:45:21,898
What were you talking? You had
only one daughter, right?

899
00:45:22,166 --> 00:45:27,103
Son-in-law, I am really lucky that
I got a son-in-law like you.

900
00:45:27,171 --> 00:45:29,036
Talk to your mother-in-law.

901
00:45:30,041 --> 00:45:33,272
Son-in-law, I always pray to God.

902
00:45:33,344 --> 00:45:36,905
That in each lifetime Shanti
should get Santosh!

903
00:45:36,981 --> 00:45:38,915
Listen to me! Mother, listen to me!

904
00:45:39,183 --> 00:45:42,414
Son-in-law, I got a
son-in-law like you!

905
00:45:42,486 --> 00:45:45,580
It has lightened all my burdens!

906
00:45:45,923 --> 00:45:48,585
Yes! Now I am carrying that burden!

907
00:45:48,659 --> 00:45:52,026
That's true! Son-in-law,
are you happy?

908
00:45:52,196 --> 00:45:53,925
Yes. I am really happy.

909
00:45:54,432 --> 00:45:57,492
I am just scared that I
might go mad in this joy.

910
00:45:58,202 --> 00:46:00,864
Son-in-law, if that happened
then what about...

911
00:46:00,938 --> 00:46:03,065
...my daughter Shanti?

912
00:46:03,941 --> 00:46:05,203
You are worried for Shanti!

913
00:46:07,445 --> 00:46:08,605
Go to hell!

914
00:46:13,017 --> 00:46:14,609
He is worried for his daughter!

915
00:46:15,219 --> 00:46:17,619
He doesn't care what happens to me!

916
00:46:19,090 --> 00:46:21,115
Listen, who are you?

917
00:46:22,226 --> 00:46:23,488
What do I tell you, sir!

918
00:46:24,462 --> 00:46:28,899
As such I am a bank cashier... but
I have forgotten how to count.

919
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:33,332
Do one thing. Don't
sit here idle. Leave.

920
00:46:37,241 --> 00:46:40,267
Idle! Can't you see all of them?

921
00:46:40,978 --> 00:46:44,436
Look, all of them are doing
some work! - Is this work?

922
00:46:44,515 --> 00:46:46,983
They are with their respective
partners. Can you see?

923
00:46:47,451 --> 00:46:50,352
Sir, I am not a loafer.
I too have a wife.

924
00:46:50,421 --> 00:46:53,618
I see. You have a wife. Bring
her here. And then sit here.

925
00:46:55,126 --> 00:46:56,650
That's the problem. Otherwise
you wouldn't have said this.

926
00:46:58,195 --> 00:47:01,528
She can't come here. And where
she is, I can't go there.

927
00:47:01,999 --> 00:47:05,457
Do one thing. Get up and sit
somewhere else. Got it?

928
00:47:05,536 --> 00:47:06,662
Don't sit here idle.

929
00:47:10,274 --> 00:47:12,606
Sir... listen!

930
00:47:15,546 --> 00:47:16,604
Tell me!

931
00:47:17,281 --> 00:47:18,543
Said it? Heard it?

932
00:47:20,017 --> 00:47:23,612
Meet me again. I will reform you.

933
00:47:24,288 --> 00:47:28,691
There is a lover everywhere.
They flirt with every girl.

934
00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:35,193
What happened? You too
are not functioning!

935
00:47:37,168 --> 00:47:39,693
There is a shortage of water.

936
00:47:40,638 --> 00:47:42,037
People are right.

937
00:47:43,307 --> 00:47:46,367
Every wife plays the charade of
crying at the time of marriage.

938
00:47:46,443 --> 00:47:48,604
Then she makes her husband
cry all his life.

939
00:47:51,115 --> 00:47:52,207
I am hungry.

940
00:47:54,518 --> 00:47:55,985
It would have been better
if I had eaten my dinner...

941
00:47:56,053 --> 00:47:57,247
...and then left home.

942
00:48:03,194 --> 00:48:05,526
I see! So now she has
remembered her husband!

943
00:48:07,064 --> 00:48:08,531
Let it ring. I won't answer.

944
00:48:13,671 --> 00:48:14,729
He is not answering.

945
00:48:15,339 --> 00:48:17,432
Dial again. He will answer it.
Dial again. Come on.

946
00:48:19,076 --> 00:48:20,737
You too hear what he says.
- Okay.

947
00:48:23,347 --> 00:48:26,748
She is hell bent after me!
I will answer it this time!

948
00:48:28,085 --> 00:48:29,143
What happened?

949
00:48:32,356 --> 00:48:33,448
Talk to him! Talk to
him! Where is he?

950
00:48:33,524 --> 00:48:34,752
Where are you?
- Hell!

951
00:48:35,092 --> 00:48:36,184
You are not coming home?

952
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:38,626
Whose house? What house?
That is your house.

953
00:48:38,696 --> 00:48:39,754
It's your father's house.

954
00:48:39,830 --> 00:48:42,321
Everything in it belongs
to your father.

955
00:48:42,399 --> 00:48:43,457
There is no place for me there.

956
00:48:44,101 --> 00:48:47,093
You come home. I will
warm your dinner.

957
00:48:47,171 --> 00:48:49,196
You have made me angry.
Isn't that enough?

958
00:48:50,374 --> 00:48:52,740
Please come home. Have your dinner.

959
00:48:53,110 --> 00:48:56,773
I don't want your food. I earn.
I am not a pauper.

960
00:48:56,847 --> 00:48:58,678
I will eat in a hotel.

961
00:48:59,383 --> 00:49:02,318
I will talk to him.
- Mr. Khurana...

962
00:49:02,386 --> 00:49:03,785
Don't take that fool's name!

963
00:49:03,854 --> 00:49:05,253
That old man is the root
cause of all problems!

964
00:49:05,322 --> 00:49:06,789
He couldn't see me happy.
- Old man!

965
00:49:07,391 --> 00:49:09,791
So he got me married to you.

966
00:49:10,127 --> 00:49:11,788
And he got such a nice
wife for himself.

967
00:49:12,396 --> 00:49:15,263
If I had my way, I will push
that old man in some ditch.

968
00:49:15,332 --> 00:49:17,197
Both the husband and wife...

969
00:49:17,268 --> 00:49:18,326
You talk to him.

970
00:49:19,136 --> 00:49:22,128
Hello! Hello!
- Hello!

971
00:49:24,074 --> 00:49:25,132
The phone got disconnected.

972
00:49:25,209 --> 00:49:27,143
It didn't get disconnected.
That fool hung up.

973
00:49:27,411 --> 00:49:29,743
Shanti, the matter
is really serious.

974
00:49:30,214 --> 00:49:31,272
Now what will happen?

975
00:49:31,415 --> 00:49:33,576
What will happen? You don't worry.

976
00:49:33,651 --> 00:49:38,714
I will drag him by
his ears. Old man.

977
00:49:40,157 --> 00:49:41,454
Sir! What do you want?

978
00:49:43,627 --> 00:49:44,719
What will I get to eat?

979
00:49:45,162 --> 00:49:47,653
Sir, you will get everything
to eat here.

980
00:49:48,165 --> 00:49:49,223
Is that so?
- Yes.

981
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:52,667
Sir, I think you need
Shanti (peace)!

982
00:49:53,771 --> 00:49:55,170
How do you know Shanti?

983
00:49:55,439 --> 00:49:58,101
Sir, every man needs Shanti!

984
00:49:59,376 --> 00:50:02,174
She is my wife. She is
not a public property.

985
00:50:02,446 --> 00:50:04,607
Sir, I was talking about
peace of mind.

986
00:50:05,182 --> 00:50:07,776
And you get that only at home.
Not in the hotel.

987
00:50:08,585 --> 00:50:11,179
Here the matter is reverse.
Give me something to eat.

988
00:50:11,455 --> 00:50:14,583
I will get something, sir.
I will get something, sir.

989
00:50:14,658 --> 00:50:15,716
Okay!

990
00:50:16,327 --> 00:50:18,818
This waiter too seems like Khurana!

991
00:50:19,463 --> 00:50:21,761
You have controlled your husband!

992
00:50:22,633 --> 00:50:25,193
My thinking about men is different.

993
00:50:25,269 --> 00:50:27,260
The husband should be loving.

994
00:50:27,338 --> 00:50:29,203
He should understand his wife.

995
00:50:29,473 --> 00:50:32,533
He should support his wife.
He should be like this.

996
00:50:32,676 --> 00:50:34,871
And in this matter
I am really lucky.

997
00:50:35,212 --> 00:50:38,409
My husband is like this!
He understands me well.

998
00:50:38,716 --> 00:50:44,279
And as it is husband is that man
who accepts his wife's likings.

999
00:50:44,688 --> 00:50:46,883
He should adjust with
his wife's lifestyle.

1000
00:50:47,224 --> 00:50:49,590
He should make his
wife's joy his joy.

1001
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:52,220
On the day of the marriage we
established an understanding.

1002
00:50:52,663 --> 00:50:55,496
When we left the church
after getting married.

1003
00:50:59,436 --> 00:51:03,338
On this house, Your blessing, Lord!

1004
00:51:03,507 --> 00:51:07,841
On this house, Your grace bestowed.

1005
00:51:08,512 --> 00:51:11,845
Welcome, my lovely wife! Welcome!

1006
00:51:13,717 --> 00:51:17,813
We will begin our new
life with this house.

1007
00:51:17,888 --> 00:51:21,255
This is just a house. You
will make it heaven.

1008
00:51:21,825 --> 00:51:24,521
If I have your love, then hell
too will become heaven.

1009
00:51:24,595 --> 00:51:25,653
I love you!

1010
00:51:28,265 --> 00:51:29,857
From today we have united.

1011
00:51:29,933 --> 00:51:31,924
After a few days we too
will have a child.

1012
00:51:32,202 --> 00:51:35,603
I am sorry, Santosh. Don't
you remember that?

1013
00:51:35,672 --> 00:51:38,266
I remember! You don't want to
get pregnant so soon! - Yes!

1014
00:51:38,776 --> 00:51:41,939
Fine! We... we will have fun!
- Of course!

1015
00:51:42,212 --> 00:51:43,270
Anything else?

1016
00:51:43,881 --> 00:51:45,815
I won't change my surname!

1017
00:51:45,883 --> 00:51:48,716
I remember. We both
are husband and wife.

1018
00:51:48,786 --> 00:51:51,778
I am husband Santosh Singh.
You are wife Rosy Fernandez.

1019
00:51:52,423 --> 00:51:54,288
We are two. One frame. Two photos.

1020
00:51:54,358 --> 00:51:56,690
Let's make love the way
it's shown in the movies.

1021
00:51:57,294 --> 00:51:58,352
I am very happy.

1022
00:51:58,429 --> 00:52:00,488
Can I talk to Rosy Fernandez?

1023
00:52:00,564 --> 00:52:02,964
She is not at home. Please
call in the evening.

1024
00:52:03,033 --> 00:52:04,227
Who are you?

1025
00:52:04,301 --> 00:52:05,768
I am Rosy's husband!

1026
00:52:05,836 --> 00:52:07,531
Oh! Mr. Fernandez!

1027
00:52:08,305 --> 00:52:10,432
Not Fernandez! Santosh Singh!

1028
00:52:10,574 --> 00:52:12,974
Great! Husband is Singh!
And wife is Fernandez!

1029
00:52:13,377 --> 00:52:16,312
Did I ask you about your
wife and your surname?

1030
00:52:16,447 --> 00:52:17,971
Do you have any problem? Hang up!

1031
00:52:20,317 --> 00:52:22,945
From where do they
come to harass me!

1032
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:24,988
Yes! Yes!

1033
00:52:25,622 --> 00:52:26,680
Hello, sir!

1034
00:52:26,857 --> 00:52:28,916
There is a courier
for Rosy Fernandez!

1035
00:52:28,992 --> 00:52:30,789
Okay! Okay! Give! I will sign!

1036
00:52:30,861 --> 00:52:33,421
Are you Mr. Fernandez?
- No! I am Mr. Singh!

1037
00:52:34,331 --> 00:52:36,265
Look, I can either give
this courier to...

1038
00:52:36,333 --> 00:52:38,267
...Mrs. Rosy Fernandez
or her husband!

1039
00:52:38,602 --> 00:52:41,002
I am her husband!
- But you are Mr. Singh!

1040
00:52:41,338 --> 00:52:44,000
Yes! I am Singh! And my
wife is Rosy Fernandez.

1041
00:52:45,843 --> 00:52:48,471
Look... wife is Fernandez.
And husband is Singh!

1042
00:52:48,545 --> 00:52:49,603
How is this possible, sir?

1043
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:50,738
Not how is this possible!

1044
00:52:50,814 --> 00:52:52,805
This has happened! And government
has approved it!

1045
00:52:52,883 --> 00:52:53,941
Give! Don't talk rubbish!

1046
00:52:54,351 --> 00:52:57,752
In this marriage only husband
and wife have become one.

1047
00:52:57,821 --> 00:53:00,016
Their names have not united.
Do you understand?

1048
00:53:00,090 --> 00:53:02,354
Sir, try to understand.
There is a problem. - So?

1049
00:53:02,426 --> 00:53:03,791
This is a bank credit card!
- Yes!

1050
00:53:03,861 --> 00:53:05,294
I can either give this courier
to Mrs. Rosy Fernandez...

1051
00:53:05,362 --> 00:53:07,023
...or her husband!

1052
00:53:07,097 --> 00:53:08,428
Can't you see this husband?

1053
00:53:08,499 --> 00:53:11,900
Sir, sir, I am sorry! Don't mind,
sir! Thank you, sir! Sorry, sir!

1054
00:53:11,969 --> 00:53:13,300
Am I not husband?

1055
00:53:14,638 --> 00:53:16,037
Am I husband or an envelope?

1056
00:53:16,807 --> 00:53:20,038
If this problem existed everywhere
then what to do?

1057
00:53:20,644 --> 00:53:23,613
I have solution for everything.
Come here.

1058
00:53:28,519 --> 00:53:29,645
Hail, Mr. Khurana!

1059
00:53:30,387 --> 00:53:32,446
Mr. Khurana, you have
solved this problem!

1060
00:53:32,523 --> 00:53:33,547
What to do with the other problem?

1061
00:53:33,624 --> 00:53:37,492
People address me as Mr.
Fernandez on the phone!

1062
00:53:39,396 --> 00:53:40,454
I have a solution for that too.
- What?

1063
00:53:40,531 --> 00:53:42,055
When the bell rings...
- Yes.

1064
00:53:42,332 --> 00:53:43,856
Pick up receiver.
- Yes.

1065
00:53:43,934 --> 00:53:44,992
And say...

1066
00:53:45,068 --> 00:53:47,332
Hello. Santosh Singh. Rosy
Fernandez's husband.

1067
00:53:47,671 --> 00:53:49,639
Darling, Rosy here.

1068
00:53:49,706 --> 00:53:51,401
Rosy darling, tell me.

1069
00:53:52,809 --> 00:53:53,935
There is a good news.

1070
00:53:54,011 --> 00:53:55,410
Give me the good news.

1071
00:53:55,679 --> 00:53:58,409
Do you know? The press is
sending me to London.

1072
00:53:58,482 --> 00:54:00,848
What will I do here alone, darling?

1073
00:54:00,918 --> 00:54:04,479
Can I leave you alone?
We are going together.

1074
00:54:04,555 --> 00:54:05,613
And do you know?

1075
00:54:05,689 --> 00:54:08,783
I have already applied
for our visas.

1076
00:54:08,859 --> 00:54:11,555
Good! It will be our honeymoon
too in a way.

1077
00:54:15,432 --> 00:54:16,490
Hello.

1078
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:17,758
Yes.

1079
00:54:19,970 --> 00:54:21,028
Yes.

1080
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:24,498
Yes.

1081
00:54:25,909 --> 00:54:27,103
Is that so? Okay!

1082
00:54:29,379 --> 00:54:30,437
What happened, darling?

1083
00:54:31,715 --> 00:54:33,114
It was the travel agent's call.

1084
00:54:33,717 --> 00:54:36,584
He was asking for a proof that
we both are husband and wife.

1085
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:39,917
Our surnames are different.
We won't get a couple's visa.

1086
00:54:39,990 --> 00:54:44,120
If not a couple visa, fine.
We can get individual visa.

1087
00:54:44,962 --> 00:54:47,658
How will we go?
- I will go alone.

1088
00:54:48,465 --> 00:54:50,933
You will leave me?
- Yes. I will have to go.

1089
00:54:51,001 --> 00:54:53,094
It means you can't change
your surname.

1090
00:54:53,170 --> 00:54:54,467
But you can change me.

1091
00:54:54,838 --> 00:54:57,466
Should I change my identity
after marriage?

1092
00:54:57,541 --> 00:54:59,133
Who will know Rosy Singh?

1093
00:54:59,209 --> 00:55:01,677
Then add my surname to your surname.

1094
00:55:01,745 --> 00:55:03,144
Become Rosy Fernandez Singh!

1095
00:55:03,213 --> 00:55:06,478
Look, Santosh. I had cleared
this matter on the wedding.

1096
00:55:06,550 --> 00:55:09,144
What did I know that I will
become Fernandez from Singh!

1097
00:55:10,087 --> 00:55:13,716
It feels as if you have adopted
me and not married me.

1098
00:55:13,790 --> 00:55:15,485
Not a wife, but you have
become my mother.

1099
00:55:16,093 --> 00:55:17,492
What do you want?

1100
00:55:17,561 --> 00:55:20,758
You will have to change
your surname! - I won't!

1101
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:22,025
You will have to change!
You will have to change!

1102
00:55:22,099 --> 00:55:23,430
You will have to change!
- I won't do it!

1103
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:24,797
Listen to me, Rosy!

1104
00:55:24,868 --> 00:55:27,029
If you won't change it,
then I will divorce you!

1105
00:55:27,104 --> 00:55:28,162
Who is he?

1106
00:55:28,238 --> 00:55:30,672
Who! What do you think of yourself?
- I don't know!

1107
00:55:30,741 --> 00:55:32,971
You are a journalist! So you will
make your husband your slave!

1108
00:55:33,043 --> 00:55:35,068
I don't know who he is!
- Listen, Rosy!

1109
00:55:35,145 --> 00:55:36,976
From today you will do
what I will tell you!

1110
00:55:37,047 --> 00:55:38,947
Otherwise you will have
to leave this house!

1111
00:55:39,016 --> 00:55:40,176
Who are you?

1112
00:55:40,784 --> 00:55:43,048
Hey! Who are you? What do
you think of yourself?

1113
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:45,020
Call the waiter! Call the waiter!
- Shut up! You shut up!

1114
00:55:45,088 --> 00:55:48,455
Sir! Sir! Sir!
- Talk to him! - What are you doing?

1115
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:51,585
Come! Come!

1116
00:55:52,729 --> 00:55:53,787
Come, sir!
- Sorry!

1117
00:55:53,864 --> 00:55:55,525
He is mad! - I am sorry! - Sorry!
- I am very sorry!

1118
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:57,191
Come, sir! Come, sir!

1119
00:56:06,543 --> 00:56:09,637
Wow! There is light in your house!

1120
00:56:10,614 --> 00:56:12,548
And here you have lit candle!

1121
00:56:12,616 --> 00:56:16,609
Where is the candle? There
is light all around.

1122
00:56:16,687 --> 00:56:17,745
I am talking about your food.

1123
00:56:17,821 --> 00:56:18,879
You were going to eat in the hotel.

1124
00:56:18,955 --> 00:56:20,889
Whether I eat at the hotel,
on the street, anywhere!

1125
00:56:20,957 --> 00:56:22,481
It's none of your business!

1126
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:23,753
When did you made
this Indian burger?

1127
00:56:23,827 --> 00:56:24,885
In the evening, sir!

1128
00:56:24,961 --> 00:56:27,486
It was made in the evening.
- I know.

1129
00:56:27,564 --> 00:56:28,895
It's cold.
- I know that too.

1130
00:56:28,965 --> 00:56:32,560
I see! At home you fight and
say that you want hot food.

1131
00:56:32,636 --> 00:56:34,831
And here you are eating
this cold and stale food.

1132
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:37,500
You have no peace.

1133
00:56:37,574 --> 00:56:40,668
You ruined my life by
getting me married.

1134
00:56:40,744 --> 00:56:43,838
Now when I want to live freely,
you are stopping me!

1135
00:56:43,914 --> 00:56:45,108
Look, Santosh.

1136
00:56:45,782 --> 00:56:51,584
Anger burns a man like fire
burns dry stick. Come home.

1137
00:56:51,655 --> 00:56:52,713
I won't go home!

1138
00:56:52,789 --> 00:56:54,814
Sure?
- Yes!

1139
00:56:55,525 --> 00:56:59,689
For sure!
- Sure!

1140
00:57:00,731 --> 00:57:01,823
It means you want to go home!

1141
00:57:06,069 --> 00:57:08,537
I will go home! But
on my conditions!

1142
00:57:09,539 --> 00:57:13,134
Mr. Santosh Singh, conditions
are placed in business.

1143
00:57:13,677 --> 00:57:14,939
Not in the house.

1144
00:57:19,015 --> 00:57:20,141
Will you be able to
live without Shanti?

1145
00:57:20,217 --> 00:57:24,984
Ask that angry Shanti! She
has nobody besides me.

1146
00:57:25,055 --> 00:57:27,250
It's not a question of whether
she has anybody or not!

1147
00:57:27,624 --> 00:57:30,616
She is your wife and she
is your responsibility.

1148
00:57:30,694 --> 00:57:33,128
I don't have any responsibility.
I won't look after her.

1149
00:57:33,196 --> 00:57:35,630
Tell her that my and her
relationship is over!

1150
00:57:35,699 --> 00:57:37,997
Shut up! You are talking rubbish!

1151
00:57:38,635 --> 00:57:39,761
End of relationship!

1152
00:57:39,836 --> 00:57:43,101
And what did you say? I will drop
this old man in the ditch!

1153
00:57:43,707 --> 00:57:46,073
If I have made a mistake
by getting you married...

1154
00:57:46,143 --> 00:57:47,838
...then tell me where is that ditch?

1155
00:57:47,911 --> 00:57:50,641
I will myself jump in it!
I will beat you!

1156
00:57:55,719 --> 00:57:57,118
Eat that Indian burger!

1157
00:58:06,763 --> 00:58:08,856
Mr. Khurana is right!

1158
00:58:11,134 --> 00:58:12,328
I can't live without Shanti!

1159
00:58:15,605 --> 00:58:19,063
But tonight I will live without
her. My honour is at stake!

1160
00:58:25,749 --> 00:58:26,909
Thank you for your support!

1161
00:58:28,051 --> 00:58:29,211
Yours truly. Prem Bhatia.

1162
00:58:31,254 --> 00:58:32,687
Today Santosh is again late.

1163
00:58:34,157 --> 00:58:37,024
Sir, poor Santosh comes
from so far away.

1164
00:58:37,093 --> 00:58:39,926
Good morning, sir!
- Good morning, Santosh!

1165
00:58:39,996 --> 00:58:41,623
Again you are late.

1166
00:58:41,698 --> 00:58:44,292
Sir, on the route...
- You had a fight with your wife!

1167
00:58:49,306 --> 00:58:51,137
Sir, last night I didn't go home.

1168
00:58:51,708 --> 00:58:52,766
So sad!

1169
00:58:53,810 --> 00:58:58,372
Your name is Santosh! But there
is no contentment in you.

1170
00:58:58,782 --> 00:59:00,079
Your wife's name is Shanti.

1171
00:59:00,884 --> 00:59:02,818
And at home there is no peace.

1172
00:59:03,787 --> 00:59:05,652
Look at me, my friend!

1173
00:59:06,089 --> 00:59:08,785
My wife always sends me to office
on time. Am I ever late?

1174
00:59:11,127 --> 00:59:14,824
Everyday she gets me ready and
sends me to office like a child.

1175
00:59:15,665 --> 00:59:16,791
Everyday.

1176
00:59:19,836 --> 00:59:20,894
Prem!

1177
00:59:24,674 --> 00:59:26,801
Why are you going to office
so early today?

1178
00:59:27,143 --> 00:59:31,204
Early? I am not early.
I am late. Look.

1179
00:59:32,816 --> 00:59:35,148
Today please don't go to office.

1180
00:59:36,353 --> 00:59:39,754
How is that possible, darling?
It's important to go to office.

1181
00:59:41,258 --> 00:59:44,193
What is important for
you? Office or me?

1182
00:59:44,694 --> 00:59:47,219
What are you saying? Obviously you!

1183
00:59:48,999 --> 00:59:51,126
Then take a leave today. Okay.

1184
00:59:53,370 --> 00:59:56,862
Like this... I will be sacked.

1185
00:59:56,940 --> 00:59:58,430
So what?

1186
01:00:00,176 --> 01:00:05,239
You can't even do this for me!
And you say you love me! Liar!

1187
01:00:06,716 --> 01:00:07,774
Darling!

1188
01:00:08,852 --> 01:00:10,319
I really love you!

1189
01:00:11,821 --> 01:00:13,789
You... you want to know how much!

1190
01:00:15,725 --> 01:00:16,783
I will show you how much!

1191
01:00:22,799 --> 01:00:25,734
I swear on this sacred
fire that as long as...

1192
01:00:25,802 --> 01:00:29,260
Prem! Don't use these
filmy dialogues on me!

1193
01:00:31,374 --> 01:00:33,740
Till the time you don't
trust my love...

1194
01:00:33,810 --> 01:00:35,801
...I won't remove my hand
from this sacred fire!

1195
01:00:35,879 --> 01:00:37,073
No matter what happens!

1196
01:00:39,749 --> 01:00:40,875
This is too much!

1197
01:00:45,422 --> 01:00:47,356
It's burning! It's burning!

1198
01:00:47,824 --> 01:00:48,916
What happened, sir?

1199
01:00:52,228 --> 01:00:53,286
Santosh!
- Yes!

1200
01:00:53,363 --> 01:00:54,955
You think I am an idiot.

1201
01:00:55,031 --> 01:00:56,760
Whenever I scold you,
you bring the matter...

1202
01:00:56,833 --> 01:00:59,358
...to husband and wife's
relationship.

1203
01:01:00,303 --> 01:01:02,237
And you force me to think.

1204
01:01:02,305 --> 01:01:03,772
Sister-in-law is like this, sir.

1205
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:06,240
I pray to God that for 7 lifetimes
you get sister-in-law...

1206
01:01:06,309 --> 01:01:09,369
Shut up, Santosh. This is
my first and last birth.

1207
01:01:09,446 --> 01:01:11,937
I have lived all my 7
lifetimes in one birth!

1208
01:01:12,015 --> 01:01:13,846
Sir, you have lived all the
7 lifetimes in one lifetime?

1209
01:01:13,917 --> 01:01:15,384
Yes.
- Sister-in-law is great!

1210
01:01:15,452 --> 01:01:16,919
Sir, what is your further planning?

1211
01:01:16,987 --> 01:01:18,318
Thank you very much!
And now get out!

1212
01:01:18,388 --> 01:01:19,446
Sir... what?

1213
01:01:19,522 --> 01:01:21,217
Get out! - Okay, sir!

1214
01:01:21,291 --> 01:01:23,191
Right now get out!
- Okay, sir!

1215
01:01:30,934 --> 01:01:33,926
This is very nice. 42?

1216
01:01:35,805 --> 01:01:37,432
Shanti!
- Yes!

1217
01:01:38,808 --> 01:01:40,469
Will this shirt suit Mr. Khurana?

1218
01:01:42,278 --> 01:01:43,540
I like this shirt.

1219
01:01:45,348 --> 01:01:47,407
Santosh likes this colour?

1220
01:01:47,951 --> 01:01:51,011
I am talking about my liking.
Santosh has left home.

1221
01:01:51,287 --> 01:01:52,481
Shanti!

1222
01:01:53,823 --> 01:01:57,919
You are mad! Do you know?
Husband is like a horse.

1223
01:01:57,994 --> 01:02:00,963
You have to keep a reign on it.
Otherwise you will lose him.

1224
01:02:01,831 --> 01:02:04,527
But yesterday Mr. Khurana said
that husband is like a kite.

1225
01:02:04,968 --> 01:02:07,835
That was his example.
This is my example.

1226
01:02:07,904 --> 01:02:08,962
Now let's go.

1227
01:02:09,039 --> 01:02:12,998
He told me to pull the string
of the kite. So I did it.

1228
01:02:13,076 --> 01:02:14,441
The kite broke.

1229
01:02:15,245 --> 01:02:17,270
I have lost control on Santosh.

1230
01:02:18,114 --> 01:02:21,049
Now I don't understand what to do.

1231
01:02:21,317 --> 01:02:25,378
I have a way to control husbands.
- What?

1232
01:02:25,455 --> 01:02:30,154
Look, Shanti! Last night you
didn't warm food for Santosh.

1233
01:02:30,927 --> 01:02:32,019
Listen to me.

1234
01:02:32,996 --> 01:02:35,294
Today cook delicious
food for Santosh.

1235
01:02:35,365 --> 01:02:38,562
And take it to the bank. Then
see how his anger abates.

1236
01:02:39,536 --> 01:02:44,303
No! This won't happen!
- It will!

1237
01:02:45,308 --> 01:02:48,038
If wives want then everything
can happen!

1238
01:02:49,012 --> 01:02:51,173
After all women only have to adjust!

1239
01:02:51,948 --> 01:02:55,406
I don't understand why women
have to adjust all the time.

1240
01:02:56,019 --> 01:02:59,079
Because women are bighearted.

1241
01:03:00,023 --> 01:03:04,619
They bunch up all the sorrow,
problems in their heart.

1242
01:03:05,562 --> 01:03:09,225
Listen to me. Forget
what Santosh said.

1243
01:03:09,299 --> 01:03:11,494
And try to create a
place in his heart.

1244
01:03:15,038 --> 01:03:18,633
But do you think that this
will change Santosh?

1245
01:03:19,909 --> 01:03:22,104
You can at least try. Come on.

1246
01:03:30,587 --> 01:03:34,648
Wow! What did you tell her that
she has changed so much?

1247
01:03:35,091 --> 01:03:39,050
I have told her of the
way to control husband.

1248
01:03:40,029 --> 01:03:42,190
When will you use this way on me?

1249
01:03:43,066 --> 01:03:47,093
Mr. Khurana, you are always
under my control.

1250
01:03:47,170 --> 01:03:49,468
Because our relationship
is for 7 lifetimes.

1251
01:03:50,006 --> 01:03:51,200
Thank you, Mrs. Khurana.

1252
01:03:51,274 --> 01:03:54,107
Because of you people today
I have got a new life.

1253
01:03:54,177 --> 01:03:57,442
And I have also realised that
you don't get happiness.

1254
01:03:57,514 --> 01:03:59,675
You have to work for it.
- Yes.

1255
01:04:00,016 --> 01:04:02,246
Today I am taking the
food myself. Bye.

1256
01:04:02,318 --> 01:04:05,947
Don't just take food for him.
You have to feed him too.

1257
01:04:06,022 --> 01:04:07,284
Shut up.

1258
01:04:07,357 --> 01:04:09,951
Then see how delighted he will be.

1259
01:04:10,026 --> 01:04:11,118
And he will start singing.

1260
01:04:11,194 --> 01:04:17,133
I am my wife's lover.
People call me crazy.

1261
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:18,963
It's good that everybody
brings lunch to office.

1262
01:04:19,035 --> 01:04:20,093
When one person doesn't bring it...

1263
01:04:20,170 --> 01:04:21,228
...then he too gets to eat.

1264
01:04:21,304 --> 01:04:23,135
Yes! Yes! I will give you food.

1265
01:04:23,206 --> 01:04:25,174
You make such nice bread.
- Yes.

1266
01:04:25,241 --> 01:04:27,072
Its round. Very good!

1267
01:04:27,143 --> 01:04:28,974
I see! That's why I was wondering...

1268
01:04:29,045 --> 01:04:31,605
...why food has not
arrived for lunch.

1269
01:04:32,248 --> 01:04:34,409
Why?
- You are eating. So eat.

1270
01:04:34,484 --> 01:04:36,975
Mr. Mishra, two people are
greatly responsible...

1271
01:04:37,053 --> 01:04:39,146
...for making my life!

1272
01:04:39,222 --> 01:04:40,416
Who?

1273
01:04:40,490 --> 01:04:45,052
One is Shanti at home. And
you in the office. You!

1274
01:04:45,128 --> 01:04:47,688
Because of this my life
has changed so much.

1275
01:04:47,764 --> 01:04:49,061
Now leave. So that I can eat!

1276
01:04:49,132 --> 01:04:50,190
You eat! Eat!

1277
01:04:50,266 --> 01:04:52,063
I too have not brought my lunch
for the past 20 years.

1278
01:04:52,135 --> 01:04:54,330
But forget giving me food,
nobody has ever asked me!

1279
01:04:54,404 --> 01:04:55,666
There is a wall behind!
- Behind whom?

1280
01:04:55,738 --> 01:04:58,639
You! - Its behind! Mention
not! I can see it!

1281
01:04:58,708 --> 01:05:01,199
Instead of thinking so much,
look where you are going!

1282
01:05:01,277 --> 01:05:02,335
Otherwise in old age, if
your bones will break...

1283
01:05:02,412 --> 01:05:03,470
...then it won't mend!

1284
01:05:03,546 --> 01:05:04,672
Mr. Santosh, forget it!

1285
01:05:04,747 --> 01:05:07,409
No, no! He is a walking
cell of our office!

1286
01:05:07,483 --> 01:05:10,077
Who is eating with whom?
Who is gossiping!

1287
01:05:10,153 --> 01:05:11,620
He has all the information!

1288
01:05:11,688 --> 01:05:14,179
Forget it! You don't worry!
Come on! Let's eat!

1289
01:05:30,607 --> 01:05:33,041
Who will finish this?
- No, please! I am done!

1290
01:05:33,109 --> 01:05:38,570
No, no! I... I will feed you! No,
no! You will have to eat!

1291
01:05:38,648 --> 01:05:39,706
One more!

1292
01:05:43,186 --> 01:05:45,177
Let me finish it!
- Eat it!

1293
01:05:45,255 --> 01:05:47,587
You eat it! You eat it!

1294
01:05:59,068 --> 01:06:00,729
I see! Now I understood!

1295
01:06:00,803 --> 01:06:02,236
Look, you are misunderstanding!

1296
01:06:02,305 --> 01:06:03,636
Don't try to hide the truth!

1297
01:06:03,706 --> 01:06:06,072
What is there to hide?
Amidst so many people...

1298
01:06:06,142 --> 01:06:07,336
She was feeding you.

1299
01:06:07,410 --> 01:06:10,072
Now I understand why you don't
like home made food.

1300
01:06:10,146 --> 01:06:11,807
No, this is not so!
- Don't touch me!

1301
01:06:11,881 --> 01:06:14,076
My hands are clean! Shivani
was feeding me!

1302
01:06:14,150 --> 01:06:15,208
Look, enough of this drama!

1303
01:06:15,285 --> 01:06:17,344
I have understood what you are!

1304
01:06:17,420 --> 01:06:19,786
What have you understood?
I am your husband Santosh!

1305
01:06:19,856 --> 01:06:21,221
I don't want such a husband!

1306
01:06:21,291 --> 01:06:24,158
What are you saying? You won't
find such a husband!

1307
01:06:24,227 --> 01:06:27,162
You are right! I won't find
a husband like you!

1308
01:06:27,230 --> 01:06:30,165
Though you have a wife, still you
tell another girl to feed you!

1309
01:06:30,233 --> 01:06:33,168
No, no, sister-in-law! For the past
half an hour, he is eating!

1310
01:06:33,236 --> 01:06:35,363
I mean Shivani has just fed
him 5 loaves of bread.

1311
01:06:35,438 --> 01:06:36,496
5 loaves of bread!

1312
01:06:36,572 --> 01:06:38,665
At home he can't even
eat one piece of bread.

1313
01:06:38,741 --> 01:06:40,299
Sister-in-law, it's
your mistake too.

1314
01:06:40,376 --> 01:06:41,707
You don't give him lunch.

1315
01:06:41,778 --> 01:06:43,609
And you come and give
him compliment.

1316
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:45,113
So I am abused here.

1317
01:06:45,181 --> 01:06:47,172
No! That's not what he means!

1318
01:06:47,250 --> 01:06:49,241
This is what I meant!

1319
01:06:49,319 --> 01:06:53,119
He gets fits of lying! He is
lying! Why are you lying?

1320
01:06:53,189 --> 01:06:57,182
Look, Shivani! You were
feeding an enemy!

1321
01:06:57,260 --> 01:06:58,454
I am taking his side. And
he doesn't understand.

1322
01:06:58,528 --> 01:06:59,620
I understand everything.

1323
01:06:59,696 --> 01:07:02,187
You are not just talking!
You are spreading poising!

1324
01:07:02,265 --> 01:07:05,530
I am with my wife! And who are you?
- Mishra!

1325
01:07:05,601 --> 01:07:06,795
What do you mean?
- What do you mean?

1326
01:07:06,869 --> 01:07:09,201
A third person! Shut up!

1327
01:07:09,272 --> 01:07:11,832
Come on! Go and do your work!

1328
01:07:12,141 --> 01:07:15,269
Shanti sister-in-law, Santosh...
- You keep quiet! Got it?

1329
01:07:15,345 --> 01:07:18,473
You doubt her? She respects
me so much.

1330
01:07:18,548 --> 01:07:20,607
And she calls you Shanti
sister-in-law.

1331
01:07:20,683 --> 01:07:22,150
If she calls me Shanti
sister-in-law...

1332
01:07:22,218 --> 01:07:23,776
...then why doesn't she
makes you her brother.

1333
01:07:23,853 --> 01:07:26,754
Now don't talk so much,
that he feels humiliated.

1334
01:07:26,823 --> 01:07:30,156
By the way, nowadays she is
his pregnant friend. - What!

1335
01:07:30,226 --> 01:07:31,284
What!
- What!

1336
01:07:31,361 --> 01:07:32,794
So the matter has reached
to this extent!

1337
01:07:32,862 --> 01:07:34,489
Do you know what you are saying?

1338
01:07:34,564 --> 01:07:37,556
Who was telling me that
my friend is pregnant?

1339
01:07:38,301 --> 01:07:40,599
You stay within your limits
and talk, Mr. Mishra!

1340
01:07:40,670 --> 01:07:42,228
Think about your post!

1341
01:07:42,305 --> 01:07:44,239
Mr. Santosh, you said that!

1342
01:07:44,307 --> 01:07:47,708
Why are you listening to him?
He calls interview as interval!

1343
01:07:47,777 --> 01:07:48,903
Do you people know?

1344
01:07:48,978 --> 01:07:51,310
Pregnant means fixed friend. Right?

1345
01:07:51,381 --> 01:07:53,611
Mr. Mishra, not pregnant, permanent!

1346
01:07:53,683 --> 01:07:56,550
Sister-in-law, explain to him
that it's the same thing!

1347
01:07:57,387 --> 01:07:59,184
I will strangulate you! For
you it's the same meaning.

1348
01:07:59,255 --> 01:08:00,381
But for me it holds two meanings.

1349
01:08:00,456 --> 01:08:02,856
Yes. One pregnant friend and a wife.

1350
01:08:02,925 --> 01:08:04,825
Now you understood? His
English is not proper!

1351
01:08:04,894 --> 01:08:07,260
Enough! You know how to spin a yarn!

1352
01:08:07,330 --> 01:08:09,195
Shanti sister-in-law, you
are misunderstanding me!

1353
01:08:09,265 --> 01:08:11,631
I understand women
like you very well!

1354
01:08:11,701 --> 01:08:13,464
When he will eat so much outside...

1355
01:08:13,536 --> 01:08:14,798
...then what will he eat at home?

1356
01:08:14,871 --> 01:08:17,499
I am mad that I cooked
all this food for him!

1357
01:08:17,573 --> 01:08:20,474
Take this! You eat and you feed him!

1358
01:08:27,617 --> 01:08:31,417
Mr. Khurana was right! I have
lost him! Now what will I do?

1359
01:08:32,655 --> 01:08:35,715
She spilled the curd. Lady's finger!

1360
01:08:35,792 --> 01:08:37,817
Shivani, you brought chickpeas.

1361
01:08:37,894 --> 01:08:39,225
And sister-in-law has
brought lady's finger.

1362
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:42,355
You are lucky. Eat lady's
finger and chickpeas too!

1363
01:08:43,833 --> 01:08:45,232
Sir, sir, sir!

1364
01:08:45,301 --> 01:08:47,826
Were you Narad in your past birth
that you provoke people?

1365
01:08:47,904 --> 01:08:49,667
Calm down! Calm down! Calm down!

1366
01:08:49,739 --> 01:08:53,231
Were you a matchstick that
you fire up so soon?

1367
01:08:53,309 --> 01:08:55,743
Stop this quarrel. Boss
has called you.

1368
01:08:57,513 --> 01:08:59,242
You go. Everything will be fine.
Everything will be fine.

1369
01:08:59,315 --> 01:09:00,782
Go.

1370
01:09:00,850 --> 01:09:03,250
Not go. Come. You too
have been called.

1371
01:09:03,319 --> 01:09:04,843
Why me?
- Come!

1372
01:09:04,921 --> 01:09:06,889
Even if I murder you,
it's not enough!

1373
01:09:09,258 --> 01:09:10,316
Shut up!

1374
01:09:10,393 --> 01:09:12,384
What did I do?

1375
01:09:12,462 --> 01:09:14,930
You didn't do anything!
- No!

1376
01:09:15,264 --> 01:09:17,391
That's what I am saying!
You don't do anything!

1377
01:09:17,467 --> 01:09:19,401
What do you both do in the bank?

1378
01:09:20,603 --> 01:09:22,332
Go home! You both go home!

1379
01:09:22,405 --> 01:09:26,341
Sir, sir, don't do that! Please,
sir! Sir, I will be in trouble!

1380
01:09:26,409 --> 01:09:27,467
Yes!

1381
01:09:27,543 --> 01:09:31,673
Sir, with great difficult today
sister-in-law brought his lunch.

1382
01:09:31,747 --> 01:09:34,443
If he lost his job,
she will leave him.

1383
01:09:34,517 --> 01:09:35,677
Why don't you say anything?

1384
01:09:35,751 --> 01:09:38,276
Sir, we get jobs with
great difficulty!

1385
01:09:38,354 --> 01:09:40,345
Please try and understand, sir!

1386
01:09:41,357 --> 01:09:42,415
Yes, sir!

1387
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:46,021
You both are cowards!

1388
01:09:46,596 --> 01:09:48,928
That's why your wife created
this commotion!

1389
01:09:49,565 --> 01:09:50,623
Look at me!

1390
01:09:51,367 --> 01:09:53,358
My wife heeds everything that I say!

1391
01:09:53,436 --> 01:09:56,303
She sits, stands, and even dances.

1392
01:09:57,974 --> 01:10:01,671
I love my wife. My
sigh frightens her.

1393
01:10:02,044 --> 01:10:04,478
I love you! I love you! I love you!
I love you! I love you!

1394
01:10:04,547 --> 01:10:06,378
What? What is this?

1395
01:10:06,449 --> 01:10:09,850
I am saying come! Come! Come! Come!

1396
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:11,443
I love you! I love you! I love you!

1397
01:10:11,521 --> 01:10:14,649
I know you love me. I can feel it.

1398
01:10:15,725 --> 01:10:19,388
I too want you love me
like this. All right.

1399
01:10:19,462 --> 01:10:22,022
You don't give me the
chance, darling.

1400
01:10:22,665 --> 01:10:25,463
At least give me a chance.
Come here!

1401
01:10:26,435 --> 01:10:27,527
Yes!

1402
01:10:27,603 --> 01:10:28,661
Are you ready!

1403
01:10:39,415 --> 01:10:41,713
What are you doing?
- Kissing you!

1404
01:10:42,818 --> 01:10:46,481
Is that the way you
kiss! You bit me!

1405
01:10:48,491 --> 01:10:50,857
Sorry! One more try!

1406
01:10:51,827 --> 01:10:56,423
Absolutely not! I am feeling
sleepy! I am going to sleep!

1407
01:10:57,366 --> 01:11:02,702
What! Darling, you only said!
I won't leave you like this!

1408
01:11:07,376 --> 01:11:08,434
What happened?

1409
01:11:08,511 --> 01:11:09,876
It's paining!

1410
01:11:09,946 --> 01:11:11,971
I am sorry! I am sorry!
I will massage your back!

1411
01:11:12,048 --> 01:11:14,448
Turn! Turn! Better?

1412
01:11:14,917 --> 01:11:17,715
Go down!
- Silly me!

1413
01:11:18,921 --> 01:11:20,821
Okay!
- Go down!

1414
01:11:22,391 --> 01:11:23,517
Down?
- Yes!

1415
01:11:23,593 --> 01:11:24,821
I didn't even fall here!

1416
01:11:25,394 --> 01:11:26,520
Go down!

1417
01:11:28,030 --> 01:11:31,659
Now I am doubt you! You liar!
- Do down!

1418
01:11:32,602 --> 01:11:35,935
You are such a liar! You
just wanted a massage...

1419
01:11:37,406 --> 01:11:39,601
Sir! Sir! Sir!

1420
01:11:42,678 --> 01:11:44,612
I was telling you both to go home!

1421
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:46,910
Look, you will stay here!
I can't do this!

1422
01:11:46,983 --> 01:11:49,076
You will stay here! And we will
go home! I can't do this!

1423
01:11:49,151 --> 01:11:51,551
Listen! Today is my
wedding anniversary!

1424
01:11:51,621 --> 01:11:52,952
Congratulations, sir!
- Thank you!

1425
01:11:53,022 --> 01:11:54,887
Sir, I will go home! Otherwise
you know Shanti!

1426
01:11:54,957 --> 01:11:56,424
She won't spare me!

1427
01:11:56,492 --> 01:11:57,686
Okay! Okay! But after the party!

1428
01:11:57,760 --> 01:11:59,091
Because you both have to make
all the arrangements.

1429
01:11:59,161 --> 01:12:05,031
Yes! Sir is right! Eat in
the party and then go home!

1430
01:12:05,101 --> 01:12:06,432
We will make all the engagements!

1431
01:12:06,502 --> 01:12:07,560
Thank you!
- Fine?

1432
01:12:07,637 --> 01:12:08,695
Now go! Go!

1433
01:12:09,872 --> 01:12:11,499
I don't understand.

1434
01:12:11,574 --> 01:12:13,439
When you wanted Shivani
to feed you...

1435
01:12:13,509 --> 01:12:15,773
...then why did you call
Shanti sister-in-law?

1436
01:12:15,845 --> 01:12:20,578
I was mad, Mr. Mishra! That I
let Shanti... Shivani feed me!

1437
01:12:21,584 --> 01:12:24,576
Now I feel that Shanti will
never serve me meals.

1438
01:12:24,654 --> 01:12:27,953
I don't know. But how
do you toilet her?

1439
01:12:28,024 --> 01:12:31,460
Tolerate her, Mr. Mishra!
You say everything wrongly!

1440
01:12:31,527 --> 01:12:32,619
Please spare me!

1441
01:12:32,695 --> 01:12:34,663
Exactly! Tolerate! Not
there, come here!

1442
01:12:35,531 --> 01:12:37,999
Look, Mr. Mishra. I have to
spend my life with her.

1443
01:12:38,067 --> 01:12:40,535
You go to boss's house.
I will go to my house.

1444
01:12:40,603 --> 01:12:42,195
I will explain to Shanti.

1445
01:12:42,271 --> 01:12:45,536
It's futile to go home.
Understand one thing.

1446
01:12:45,608 --> 01:12:47,872
All the wives in the
world are non sex.

1447
01:12:47,943 --> 01:12:49,877
Nonsense, Mr. Mishra!

1448
01:12:49,945 --> 01:12:51,845
What difference does that makes?

1449
01:12:51,914 --> 01:12:54,747
Tell me something. Will we
go walking to boss's house?

1450
01:12:54,817 --> 01:12:56,546
Will we go flying? How will we go?

1451
01:12:56,619 --> 01:12:57,813
We will take an auto!

1452
01:12:57,887 --> 01:12:59,548
Good! Auto driver, come here!

1453
01:13:01,557 --> 01:13:03,491
Mr. Singh, your post is
higher than my post!

1454
01:13:03,559 --> 01:13:05,493
But shall I something? Tell me!

1455
01:13:05,561 --> 01:13:06,619
Go ahead!

1456
01:13:06,696 --> 01:13:11,633
No. I want to say that you too
are sensitive and a naive man.

1457
01:13:11,701 --> 01:13:14,568
That's why your wife
doesn't respect you.

1458
01:13:14,637 --> 01:13:17,504
I swear there is a grave
problem of wives.

1459
01:13:17,573 --> 01:13:20,007
Look, even this auto
driver is listening.

1460
01:13:20,076 --> 01:13:23,170
Wives think that husbands
are condom.

1461
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:28,114
Why are you laughing? Seniors
are talking here.

1462
01:13:28,184 --> 01:13:29,583
Do you know the meaning of condom?

1463
01:13:29,652 --> 01:13:30,914
Useless! Of no use!

1464
01:13:30,986 --> 01:13:32,112
So say that!

1465
01:13:32,188 --> 01:13:34,520
Understood? Learn something
from these people!

1466
01:13:34,590 --> 01:13:35,648
Learn from them!

1467
01:13:35,725 --> 01:13:38,159
You too are teaching me in
front of this auto driver!

1468
01:13:38,227 --> 01:13:41,162
I mean to say if you want
to control your wife...

1469
01:13:41,230 --> 01:13:43,596
Beat her! Hit her!

1470
01:13:43,666 --> 01:13:44,928
I am an educated man!

1471
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,524
It's a sin to raise
your hands on women.

1472
01:13:46,602 --> 01:13:49,935
It's a sin to raise your hands
on women... not on wives!

1473
01:13:50,005 --> 01:13:52,940
Will this control the wife?
- Then what!

1474
01:13:53,008 --> 01:13:56,671
What's the harm in doing
what he is saying! Do it!

1475
01:13:56,746 --> 01:13:59,180
But for that you need guts!

1476
01:13:59,248 --> 01:14:01,148
Don't talk about guts!
I have enough guts!

1477
01:14:01,217 --> 01:14:03,549
So first use it and then believe it.

1478
01:14:03,619 --> 01:14:04,677
What do you mean?

1479
01:14:04,754 --> 01:14:05,880
He means if there is
something in you...

1480
01:14:05,955 --> 01:14:07,149
...then you will feel angry.

1481
01:14:07,223 --> 01:14:08,622
Be a man!

1482
01:14:08,691 --> 01:14:11,558
I am a man! But I can't
raise my hands on Shanti!

1483
01:14:11,627 --> 01:14:12,889
I love Shanti!

1484
01:14:12,962 --> 01:14:14,020
Why are you harping about love?

1485
01:14:14,096 --> 01:14:16,155
Know one thing! A great
poet has said this!

1486
01:14:16,232 --> 01:14:18,928
Everything is fair
and lovely in love!

1487
01:14:19,635 --> 01:14:22,570
What are you doing? You don't
understand anything!

1488
01:14:22,638 --> 01:14:24,572
You are so childish!

1489
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:25,698
Get down!
- Why?

1490
01:14:25,775 --> 01:14:27,208
Get down!
- Why?

1491
01:14:27,276 --> 01:14:28,573
Make arrangement for the party!

1492
01:14:28,644 --> 01:14:30,077
And I will go home and be a man!

1493
01:14:30,146 --> 01:14:32,637
Stop the auto! Let him
get down! Stop it!

1494
01:14:32,715 --> 01:14:34,182
I am jumping! -Go!

1495
01:14:34,250 --> 01:14:35,842
I am going! I am going!
- Come on!

1496
01:14:39,588 --> 01:14:41,112
Why are you worried, Shanti?

1497
01:14:41,190 --> 01:14:44,182
Let Santosh come, I will talk to
him. Am I right, Mrs. Khurana.

1498
01:14:44,927 --> 01:14:46,986
Shanti, don't be tense.

1499
01:14:47,329 --> 01:14:49,320
You should give tension
to your husband! Yes!

1500
01:14:49,799 --> 01:14:51,596
What are you saying, Mrs. Khurana?

1501
01:14:52,935 --> 01:14:56,666
You don't give me tension.
You give me only love.

1502
01:14:57,139 --> 01:15:01,599
Because you are my honey.
My darling. My sweetheart.

1503
01:15:01,744 --> 01:15:04,679
Keep quiet! This is not
our house, Mr. Khurana!

1504
01:15:04,747 --> 01:15:08,808
You don't need a house to love.
Am I right, Shanti!

1505
01:15:09,618 --> 01:15:12,610
You both are so lucky! You both
love each other so much!

1506
01:15:12,955 --> 01:15:14,013
Touchwood! Touchwood!

1507
01:15:14,223 --> 01:15:16,157
I wish Santosh too had
loved me like this!

1508
01:15:20,830 --> 01:15:21,888
Santosh!

1509
01:15:23,632 --> 01:15:25,031
Santosh! You won't die!

1510
01:15:25,100 --> 01:15:27,159
Why? Were you praying for my death?

1511
01:15:27,236 --> 01:15:29,363
No! Shanti was talking about you!

1512
01:15:29,638 --> 01:15:31,162
Will you spread more discord?

1513
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:33,299
You said you won't come home.

1514
01:15:33,375 --> 01:15:34,967
Then how did you come?
- By auto!

1515
01:15:35,044 --> 01:15:36,636
Auto! I see! Even when
you have a wife...

1516
01:15:36,712 --> 01:15:39,044
...you flirt with another woman!

1517
01:15:39,114 --> 01:15:40,706
Aren't you ashamed!
- This is a lie!

1518
01:15:40,983 --> 01:15:44,043
If it's a lie then why did you let
that girl feed you in the bank?

1519
01:15:45,921 --> 01:15:47,786
She forgot to get the spoon!

1520
01:15:48,257 --> 01:15:49,383
So she was feeding me with her hand!

1521
01:15:49,658 --> 01:15:51,990
See how he is talking!
He is shameless!

1522
01:15:52,061 --> 01:15:54,791
Shame! And you are right?

1523
01:15:55,331 --> 01:15:57,925
You humiliated me in front
of my bank staff!

1524
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,730
Santosh! As it is she is upset.

1525
01:16:01,337 --> 01:16:03,134
Instead of mollifying her,
you are scolding her.

1526
01:16:03,205 --> 01:16:04,263
She is upset!

1527
01:16:04,340 --> 01:16:09,334
Mr. Khurana! Now I have understood
how to control my wife!

1528
01:16:09,411 --> 01:16:11,402
Shut up! You have started talking
so much! Mr. Khurana!

1529
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:14,808
I was just talking. Now I
will do it and show her.

1530
01:16:15,017 --> 01:16:17,417
What?
- Second marriage!

1531
01:16:18,954 --> 01:16:21,422
Second marriage!
- Yes! Second marriage!

1532
01:16:21,690 --> 01:16:23,089
Who will marry him?

1533
01:16:23,692 --> 01:16:25,353
Shanti has come on our guarantee!

1534
01:16:25,427 --> 01:16:27,418
Yes! I am paying the price of that!

1535
01:16:27,696 --> 01:16:29,220
You can't handle one marriage!

1536
01:16:29,298 --> 01:16:30,424
What will you handle two marriages!

1537
01:16:30,699 --> 01:16:31,757
The person who doesn't have
a drawstring in his pyjama...

1538
01:16:31,834 --> 01:16:32,892
...he shouldn't put the drawstring...

1539
01:16:32,968 --> 01:16:34,094
...in other's pyjama!

1540
01:16:34,169 --> 01:16:36,433
Mr. Khurana, I don't wear pyjama!

1541
01:16:36,705 --> 01:16:38,434
Are you a man or a pyjama!
- I am a pyjama!

1542
01:16:38,707 --> 01:16:39,765
Pyjama!
- No! I am a man!

1543
01:16:39,842 --> 01:16:40,900
You are a man!
- Yes!

1544
01:16:40,976 --> 01:16:42,967
Yes, now he has got a heroine!

1545
01:16:43,112 --> 01:16:44,238
He roams around like a hero!

1546
01:16:44,313 --> 01:16:45,371
You too were a heroine!

1547
01:16:45,447 --> 01:16:46,778
Saying this you people
had framed me!

1548
01:16:47,049 --> 01:16:48,983
That she is the only heroine
in her village.

1549
01:16:49,051 --> 01:16:50,109
She was a heroine!

1550
01:16:50,185 --> 01:16:51,709
But what did I know that after
marriage and after the interval...

1551
01:16:51,787 --> 01:16:53,448
...you will become a villain!

1552
01:16:53,722 --> 01:16:56,987
I am not a villain! But now
I will become a villain!

1553
01:16:58,994 --> 01:17:00,723
Mine!
- Mine!

1554
01:17:00,796 --> 01:17:02,058
It's my message!
- Read it!

1555
01:17:02,932 --> 01:17:04,991
What is written?
- Hello, sir! Yes, sir!

1556
01:17:05,734 --> 01:17:09,067
Sir, I have reached your house!
Yes, sir! Yes, sir!

1557
01:17:10,205 --> 01:17:13,072
It was my boss's call!
So you people survived.

1558
01:17:13,742 --> 01:17:15,209
But Shanti, I won't spare you!

1559
01:17:15,277 --> 01:17:17,142
You have humiliated me in
front of the entire office!

1560
01:17:17,947 --> 01:17:21,144
You care for your honour! You
have ruined my whole life!

1561
01:17:21,216 --> 01:17:23,878
Is that so? I will see you!

1562
01:17:24,153 --> 01:17:26,087
And these people who have
come as your dowry too!

1563
01:17:28,023 --> 01:17:29,081
They have no work!

1564
01:17:29,158 --> 01:17:31,023
Look, how he ran away
scared! See this!

1565
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:34,752
Shanti, don't worry. Everything
will be fine.

1566
01:17:34,964 --> 01:17:37,159
He will come and say sorry.
Just control yourself.

1567
01:17:38,367 --> 01:17:41,165
Shall I say something?
Let's go out! Come on!

1568
01:17:41,770 --> 01:17:44,034
My name is Abdul.

1569
01:17:44,773 --> 01:17:47,105
My name is Abdul.

1570
01:17:47,176 --> 01:17:48,507
Let's go! Come on! Come on!

1571
01:17:48,777 --> 01:17:50,768
So? You had gone for hunting!
Did you catch the prey?

1572
01:17:50,846 --> 01:17:51,904
What happened?

1573
01:17:51,981 --> 01:17:54,176
What nonsense! My boss called!

1574
01:17:54,249 --> 01:17:55,910
Otherwise I would have shown her!
Drive the auto! Do your work!

1575
01:17:55,985 --> 01:17:58,977
Show what? We can't show anything!

1576
01:17:59,054 --> 01:18:02,114
We grow old hearing wife's taunts!

1577
01:18:02,191 --> 01:18:05,524
And we men in our
anger say anything.

1578
01:18:05,794 --> 01:18:06,988
That we will say this,
we will do that.

1579
01:18:07,262 --> 01:18:08,991
But we can't do anything.

1580
01:18:09,331 --> 01:18:11,799
Some insane people go and do it...

1581
01:18:11,867 --> 01:18:14,802
...and ruin their lives and
their families, both.

1582
01:18:14,870 --> 01:18:16,531
Drive the auto! Otherwise
my boss will ruin my life!

1583
01:18:16,805 --> 01:18:18,796
You talk rubbish! You
don't have manners!

1584
01:18:19,808 --> 01:18:22,800
What did I say? He got infuriated.

1585
01:18:23,078 --> 01:18:24,545
Put the auto in gear
and drive quietly!

1586
01:18:25,147 --> 01:18:27,945
Think about your family and
not about other's families!

1587
01:18:28,083 --> 01:18:29,812
And don't bluff so much! Got it?

1588
01:18:30,219 --> 01:18:33,086
I pay you. So drop me
where I have to go!

1589
01:18:33,956 --> 01:18:36,356
Don't give me suggestion.
I get angry!

1590
01:18:38,827 --> 01:18:40,351
Santosh, hi!

1591
01:18:43,098 --> 01:18:44,565
Hang on! Hang on! I
will get down here!

1592
01:18:46,435 --> 01:18:47,493
Nice babe!

1593
01:18:48,837 --> 01:18:51,101
She works in my office! What babe!

1594
01:18:53,108 --> 01:18:54,166
Time waste!

1595
01:18:54,243 --> 01:18:56,837
What are you doing here?
- My duty.

1596
01:18:57,046 --> 01:18:58,104
Here on the street?

1597
01:18:58,447 --> 01:19:01,575
Yes! Now I have to do
what sir tells me.

1598
01:19:02,051 --> 01:19:05,111
So sir has told you to handle the
crowd at this traffic signal?

1599
01:19:06,455 --> 01:19:10,391
Santosh, you forgot. Today is
sir's wedding anniversary.

1600
01:19:11,060 --> 01:19:14,052
He wanted a gift for his wife.
So he has sent me.

1601
01:19:14,863 --> 01:19:15,921
You too come.

1602
01:19:16,865 --> 01:19:19,459
Fine. Now when we have met, we
will buy the gift together.

1603
01:19:19,535 --> 01:19:20,593
Come on!
- Let's go!

1604
01:19:21,136 --> 01:19:22,194
Surprise!

1605
01:19:22,471 --> 01:19:24,871
What surprise? Why are
you hiding from us?

1606
01:19:25,140 --> 01:19:27,199
Where have you organised the party?
You didn't even tell us!

1607
01:19:27,342 --> 01:19:29,333
Well, you will find
out in the evening.

1608
01:19:29,878 --> 01:19:33,871
Fine. Tell us what is your
husband gifting you?

1609
01:19:33,949 --> 01:19:37,407
I don't know. But we
can do one thing.

1610
01:19:37,486 --> 01:19:38,612
Why don't you all guess?

1611
01:19:39,621 --> 01:19:42,556
Yes! Must be a diamond set! Right?

1612
01:19:42,891 --> 01:19:43,949
No!

1613
01:19:44,026 --> 01:19:46,290
Is he taking you to the moon?

1614
01:19:46,895 --> 01:19:47,953
No!

1615
01:19:48,030 --> 01:19:50,897
Then what is it? The 8th
wonder of the world!

1616
01:19:52,167 --> 01:19:53,896
Well, something different!

1617
01:19:54,303 --> 01:19:56,032
Prem definitely knows
me and my taste.

1618
01:19:56,438 --> 01:19:57,905
He will give me such a
gift which no husband...

1619
01:19:57,973 --> 01:20:00,100
...has ever given to his wife.

1620
01:20:01,977 --> 01:20:03,911
My Prem will buy such a gift for me!

1621
01:20:04,513 --> 01:20:05,571
Is that necklace nice?

1622
01:20:07,249 --> 01:20:10,241
Buy it for your wife. As
it is she is very angry.

1623
01:20:10,586 --> 01:20:13,111
Shanti likes necklaces a lot.
- Is that so?

1624
01:20:14,923 --> 01:20:16,117
Yes!
- Is it good?

1625
01:20:16,658 --> 01:20:17,920
Hang on, ma'am!

1626
01:20:18,594 --> 01:20:19,925
Really? Okay!

1627
01:20:21,330 --> 01:20:22,388
Buy it!

1628
01:20:23,065 --> 01:20:28,469
It will suit Shanti! Because her
complexion matches with this colour.

1629
01:20:28,604 --> 01:20:31,937
I will try it on you.
It's really nice! Good!

1630
01:20:32,941 --> 01:20:33,999
Shanti will be happy!

1631
01:20:39,081 --> 01:20:40,139
It looks good!

1632
01:20:42,417 --> 01:20:44,146
I... I...

1633
01:20:46,355 --> 01:20:48,949
Shanti... I was buying it for you...

1634
01:20:57,966 --> 01:21:00,025
Let's go, Mrs. Khurana!
- Why? What happened?

1635
01:21:00,102 --> 01:21:01,160
Let's go!

1636
01:21:01,970 --> 01:21:04,029
What happened, Shanti? You
had gone to buy the chain!

1637
01:21:04,106 --> 01:21:06,574
Yes! And inside I saw
Santosh's drama too!

1638
01:21:06,975 --> 01:21:08,636
What? Santosh is there?

1639
01:21:09,044 --> 01:21:11,035
Santosh is there. And his
Shivani too is there!

1640
01:21:11,313 --> 01:21:12,712
He is buying a necklace for her!

1641
01:21:12,981 --> 01:21:15,643
No, no! This can't be true!

1642
01:21:16,185 --> 01:21:19,052
Its true, Mrs. Khurana!
I myself saw it!

1643
01:21:20,122 --> 01:21:23,523
O God! Hang on! I will call Santosh!

1644
01:21:23,592 --> 01:21:25,059
No need!
- Quiet!

1645
01:21:28,997 --> 01:21:30,988
Hello, Santosh!
- Yes, Mrs. Khurana!

1646
01:21:31,133 --> 01:21:32,191
Where are you?

1647
01:21:32,267 --> 01:21:33,996
I am buying a necklace from D'dmas.

1648
01:21:34,203 --> 01:21:37,001
I see! Are you buying
it for Shivani?

1649
01:21:37,606 --> 01:21:39,403
No. I am buying it for Shanti!

1650
01:21:39,675 --> 01:21:42,007
Oh! For Shanti!

1651
01:21:43,011 --> 01:21:44,069
Hang up!

1652
01:21:44,146 --> 01:21:45,204
Hello! Hello!

1653
01:21:46,548 --> 01:21:49,210
He is lying! His lie was exposed
so he is making an excuse!

1654
01:21:49,484 --> 01:21:51,349
Shanti, you too!
- Please, Mrs. Khurana!

1655
01:21:51,420 --> 01:21:52,478
I don't want to listen to anything!

1656
01:21:53,222 --> 01:21:54,280
Where can I find my sister-in-law?

1657
01:21:55,157 --> 01:21:56,215
Yes!

1658
01:21:57,292 --> 01:21:59,021
So can you believe it?
This is what happened!

1659
01:21:59,161 --> 01:22:00,219
It may be a surprise!

1660
01:22:00,295 --> 01:22:01,353
Sister-in-law, greetings!
Congratulations!

1661
01:22:02,364 --> 01:22:03,763
You both have come now?
- Yes!

1662
01:22:04,032 --> 01:22:05,090
You were supposed to come earlier...

1663
01:22:05,167 --> 01:22:06,759
For the party's arrangements.
Why so late?

1664
01:22:07,035 --> 01:22:11,028
Today is the anniversary.
So sir sent to buy a gift.

1665
01:22:11,173 --> 01:22:13,107
So we got late in buying the gift.

1666
01:22:13,175 --> 01:22:15,040
See this! Husband doesn't
have the time...

1667
01:22:15,110 --> 01:22:17,578
...to buy a gift for his wife!

1668
01:22:20,315 --> 01:22:21,373
So you bought the gift?

1669
01:22:22,117 --> 01:22:26,053
We collected the gift which sir
said. - Yes! It's the same gift!

1670
01:22:26,121 --> 01:22:28,055
Open it! Open the gift right now!

1671
01:22:28,190 --> 01:22:31,057
Okay! Help me to unpack
the gift! Come on!

1672
01:22:40,402 --> 01:22:41,460
Sister-in-law, did you like it?

1673
01:22:41,536 --> 01:22:44,130
Look at this! It's bought
from the street!

1674
01:22:45,207 --> 01:22:47,072
This reveals the person's thinking!

1675
01:22:47,342 --> 01:22:49,276
You have married an ordinary man.

1676
01:22:49,544 --> 01:22:51,136
So the gift too has to be ordinary.

1677
01:22:51,346 --> 01:22:54,611
The gift is valued with
love and not the price!

1678
01:22:54,683 --> 01:22:57,413
Lovers' thinking can't
be so derogatory.

1679
01:22:57,552 --> 01:22:59,144
Don't say that, ma'am!

1680
01:23:00,088 --> 01:23:02,613
See this Taj Mahal from
Shah Jahan's view point!

1681
01:23:02,758 --> 01:23:06,091
Just shut up! My friend's
choice can't be so cheap!

1682
01:23:06,228 --> 01:23:09,095
She doesn't want this gift!
Take it! Take it!

1683
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:12,558
You broke Taj Mahal!

1684
01:23:13,635 --> 01:23:15,102
Sister-in-law, she broke Taj Mahal!

1685
01:23:15,504 --> 01:23:17,563
Your insolent friend
broke Taj Mahal!

1686
01:23:18,707 --> 01:23:22,108
Sir! Sir! Sir, she broke Taj Mahal!

1687
01:23:26,114 --> 01:23:28,844
How did this happen?
- How this happened? Sir, ask her.

1688
01:23:29,117 --> 01:23:31,108
She got up, came with a saunter...

1689
01:23:31,186 --> 01:23:32,312
...and then she broke Taj
Mahal with her hand!

1690
01:23:32,387 --> 01:23:33,445
Sir, she did it! She did it!

1691
01:23:33,522 --> 01:23:34,580
I did it?
- Yes!

1692
01:23:34,656 --> 01:23:38,717
Are you mad? And Khushi,
what is going on?

1693
01:23:38,794 --> 01:23:41,661
Have you called us
here to insult us?

1694
01:23:43,465 --> 01:23:44,523
Let's go!

1695
01:23:44,599 --> 01:23:47,466
Sir, she is lying! She is
lying in the afternoon!

1696
01:23:47,536 --> 01:23:48,594
Khushi! Khushi!

1697
01:23:48,870 --> 01:23:50,861
She went! You too go!
- Idiot!

1698
01:23:52,207 --> 01:23:54,539
Sir, she...
- Santosh, shut up! Just shut up!

1699
01:23:55,544 --> 01:23:58,138
Shivani, I told you to bring the
gift! How did he get hold of it?

1700
01:23:58,213 --> 01:24:00,147
Sir...
- No... no... no...

1701
01:24:00,215 --> 01:24:03,150
Sir, we met on the way.

1702
01:24:03,218 --> 01:24:04,742
And we together bought
the gift, sir.

1703
01:24:05,554 --> 01:24:07,681
You can't do anything properly!
- What?

1704
01:24:08,757 --> 01:24:10,622
Why are you staring at me?
Get another gift.

1705
01:24:10,692 --> 01:24:11,750
And buy Taj Mahal only.

1706
01:24:11,827 --> 01:24:13,886
But sir, sister-in-law
didn't like the gift.

1707
01:24:14,162 --> 01:24:17,620
She likes it. She is just angry
because of her friend.

1708
01:24:18,166 --> 01:24:19,428
Sir, she is a devil.

1709
01:24:19,768 --> 01:24:21,167
But sir, if you could ask her once...

1710
01:24:21,236 --> 01:24:22,294
...then it would have been good.

1711
01:24:22,504 --> 01:24:23,766
She is my wife or yours?

1712
01:24:24,172 --> 01:24:26,902
No, sir. How can she be my wife?

1713
01:24:29,244 --> 01:24:31,178
You go and buy the gift.

1714
01:24:31,380 --> 01:24:32,711
And directly come to the party!

1715
01:24:32,848 --> 01:24:34,179
Bring the gift there. And come soon.

1716
01:24:45,102 --> 01:24:46,160
Khushi!

1717
01:24:47,505 --> 01:24:48,563
Prem, don't talk to me!

1718
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:52,502
Today you insulted me
in front of my friends.

1719
01:24:53,043 --> 01:24:54,772
Couldn't you buy the present?

1720
01:24:55,246 --> 01:24:57,043
Come on, darling! I had
an important meeting!

1721
01:24:57,782 --> 01:25:00,910
I see! That's why you
sent such a cheap gift!

1722
01:25:02,987 --> 01:25:07,048
Cheap? For any person who is in
love, this is a priceless gift!

1723
01:25:07,525 --> 01:25:08,924
You know Shah Jahan
and Mumtaz thing!

1724
01:25:09,260 --> 01:25:12,195
But Shah Jahan built it after
Mumtaz's death! You too...

1725
01:25:12,263 --> 01:25:13,730
Khushi, please!
- Stop it, Prem!

1726
01:25:15,132 --> 01:25:18,192
Today I came to know what
the value of my love is.

1727
01:25:21,739 --> 01:25:23,138
Khushi, please! Don't
be angry today.

1728
01:25:24,141 --> 01:25:26,075
You can punish me after the party!

1729
01:25:27,545 --> 01:25:30,537
Today I just want to see smile
on Khushi's face! Please!

1730
01:25:57,908 --> 01:26:03,778
I saw you countless times.

1731
01:26:05,583 --> 01:26:11,920
Still I didn't feel content.

1732
01:26:12,923 --> 01:26:16,654
All the dreams I weaved
were about you.

1733
01:26:16,727 --> 01:26:19,787
Give me your hand. Come.

1734
01:26:20,664 --> 01:26:24,600
Now my life is yours.

1735
01:26:24,668 --> 01:26:27,603
It's lost in you. Come.

1736
01:26:28,873 --> 01:26:32,866
You should have a wife like boss.

1737
01:26:33,611 --> 01:26:36,808
Cultured. Beautiful. All the
facilities are available.

1738
01:26:36,947 --> 01:26:38,608
She is bloody fool!

1739
01:26:39,216 --> 01:26:40,808
Beautiful, Mr. Mishra.

1740
01:26:41,218 --> 01:26:42,810
Yes. Beautiful.

1741
01:26:42,887 --> 01:26:45,014
Look, what was boss's
life before marriage.

1742
01:26:45,089 --> 01:26:49,617
Not much fun. Now there is
liveliness all around. What a life!

1743
01:26:52,363 --> 01:26:55,025
You are right, Mr. Mishra.
Wife should be like her.

1744
01:26:56,967 --> 01:27:01,700
She has all the virtues. You
can be happy with her.

1745
01:27:02,239 --> 01:27:05,902
There are so many clouds
hidden in your tresses.

1746
01:27:05,976 --> 01:27:09,639
When it sways, rain showers.

1747
01:27:09,980 --> 01:27:13,711
I hear and say.

1748
01:27:13,918 --> 01:27:17,251
Your silences too say a lot.

1749
01:27:17,321 --> 01:27:19,255
The seasons are changing.

1750
01:27:19,323 --> 01:27:23,054
Rising from you and
setting in you.

1751
01:27:23,127 --> 01:27:24,651
Come.

1752
01:27:25,129 --> 01:27:27,063
You are the moonlight.

1753
01:27:27,131 --> 01:27:30,862
The dawn is made from your light.

1754
01:27:30,935 --> 01:27:32,664
Come.

1755
01:28:22,186 --> 01:28:25,917
If the moon sees you from the sky.

1756
01:28:25,990 --> 01:28:29,721
Then it sings your praises
to the stars.

1757
01:28:29,994 --> 01:28:33,725
There is always fragrance in you.

1758
01:28:33,864 --> 01:28:37,265
After touching you my breaths
become fragrant.

1759
01:28:37,334 --> 01:28:41,134
When you turn your
face and look down.

1760
01:28:41,205 --> 01:28:43,730
You break so many hearts.

1761
01:28:45,075 --> 01:28:48,943
Give me your heart. Take
my life in return.

1762
01:28:49,013 --> 01:28:51,743
Take all my desires. Come.

1763
01:29:09,900 --> 01:29:10,958
Why are you looking at me like this?

1764
01:29:11,769 --> 01:29:17,173
Really, Khushi. After having you,
I feel I have found the world.

1765
01:29:18,308 --> 01:29:19,900
Now I don't need anybody else.

1766
01:29:20,844 --> 01:29:22,971
Now even if I die, I have no sorrow.

1767
01:29:24,515 --> 01:29:25,777
Don't say that.

1768
01:29:29,119 --> 01:29:30,177
May your enemy die!

1769
01:29:31,055 --> 01:29:32,249
Hello, dear sister-in-law!

1770
01:29:33,791 --> 01:29:37,056
He is a flirt! He works in my bank!

1771
01:29:37,394 --> 01:29:39,521
He forms bonds with people
without marrying them.

1772
01:29:39,797 --> 01:29:40,855
Get up!
- What are you saying?

1773
01:29:40,931 --> 01:29:42,455
Sit here! Come on!

1774
01:29:45,335 --> 01:29:46,859
And why are you calling
her dear sister-in-law?

1775
01:29:47,004 --> 01:29:48,062
Can't you call her sister-in-law?

1776
01:29:48,338 --> 01:29:52,001
It means our dear sister-in-law!

1777
01:29:52,076 --> 01:29:54,408
Quiet! Not our, your sister-in-law.

1778
01:29:55,345 --> 01:29:56,403
She is my darling.

1779
01:29:56,880 --> 01:30:00,816
And you... you get lost! Hold
this! Hold this! Get up!

1780
01:30:01,218 --> 01:30:02,276
Go there!

1781
01:30:02,419 --> 01:30:03,818
What a strange man!
- Go!

1782
01:30:04,288 --> 01:30:06,813
Greetings!

1783
01:30:07,958 --> 01:30:09,016
What's your problem, Sardar?

1784
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:11,824
My problem is that
I thought I will...

1785
01:30:11,895 --> 01:30:14,489
...have a dance with
my sister-in-law.

1786
01:30:15,232 --> 01:30:19,032
Aren't you ashamed? You will dance
with your sister-in-law?

1787
01:30:19,303 --> 01:30:20,895
I am talking about dance!

1788
01:30:22,039 --> 01:30:24,371
Are you married?
- Yes!

1789
01:30:24,842 --> 01:30:26,833
If I told you that I want to
have a dance with your wife...

1790
01:30:26,910 --> 01:30:28,901
...then how will you feel?

1791
01:30:29,246 --> 01:30:32,181
Go ahead! Have a dance!
She is there!

1792
01:30:35,052 --> 01:30:36,986
Shall we exchange?

1793
01:30:40,858 --> 01:30:41,916
What a strange man!

1794
01:30:41,992 --> 01:30:44,927
I spread love. Haven't
you heard that song?

1795
01:30:45,062 --> 01:30:46,996
Spread love.

1796
01:30:48,398 --> 01:30:50,593
You spread love here. We
are leaving. Come on.

1797
01:30:50,868 --> 01:30:53,860
People won't let us romance
here. May they rot!

1798
01:30:54,004 --> 01:30:56,131
I think I will have to
spread all the love!

1799
01:31:04,081 --> 01:31:05,878
I am there and you are entertaining
yourself with the TV?

1800
01:31:05,949 --> 01:31:08,884
Who will watch the TV?

1801
01:31:08,952 --> 01:31:11,477
Now you have come. I will
spend time with you. Look.

1802
01:31:12,222 --> 01:31:13,883
You didn't eat in the party!
- Yes!

1803
01:31:13,957 --> 01:31:15,015
So I have brought food for you.

1804
01:31:15,092 --> 01:31:17,287
You take such good
care of me, Khushi!

1805
01:31:17,628 --> 01:31:19,562
So will another woman
look after you?

1806
01:31:19,897 --> 01:31:22,297
I am your wife! I will
look after you!

1807
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:26,298
I wanted a wife like you! I swear!

1808
01:31:26,904 --> 01:31:29,031
A wife who is beautiful,
cultured, sensible.

1809
01:31:29,173 --> 01:31:30,640
And who looks after her husband.

1810
01:31:30,974 --> 01:31:32,908
I will answer it.
- No, no, no!

1811
01:31:32,976 --> 01:31:34,170
What happened?
- God knows who it is!

1812
01:31:34,912 --> 01:31:36,379
Hello!
- Who is it?

1813
01:31:37,247 --> 01:31:38,441
Who are you?

1814
01:31:38,916 --> 01:31:42,044
Forget about me! Give the
phone to that hot babe!

1815
01:31:42,920 --> 01:31:43,978
Who is it?
- Who?

1816
01:31:44,188 --> 01:31:45,655
That beautiful sister-in-law!

1817
01:31:45,923 --> 01:31:47,447
Not sister-in-law! She is my wife!

1818
01:31:47,925 --> 01:31:51,190
Fine, fine! Give her the phone!
- What do you want?

1819
01:31:51,929 --> 01:31:53,658
I want to tease her!
- Hang up!

1820
01:31:54,131 --> 01:31:56,998
Don't you have a wife that
you tease other's wife!

1821
01:31:57,935 --> 01:32:00,927
He hung up! Listen to me!

1822
01:32:03,607 --> 01:32:06,940
God knows who he is! He always
harasses me on the phone!

1823
01:32:07,010 --> 01:32:09,274
So you want him to come
home and harass you?

1824
01:32:09,947 --> 01:32:11,539
Let me get his address!

1825
01:32:11,615 --> 01:32:12,946
I will make his plight
such that he...

1826
01:32:13,016 --> 01:32:14,950
...won't be able to
call anybody else!

1827
01:32:15,953 --> 01:32:19,286
Let's have our food! I don't
want to spoil the night!

1828
01:32:19,423 --> 01:32:20,685
I will feed you! I will feed you!

1829
01:32:26,096 --> 01:32:27,154
O my God!

1830
01:32:31,969 --> 01:32:33,027
Coming!

1831
01:32:34,972 --> 01:32:36,098
Are you in such haste?

1832
01:32:37,307 --> 01:32:41,971
Whether Kashi, Patna
or Kolkata sways.

1833
01:32:43,981 --> 01:32:46,643
Ma'am! Ma'am!

1834
01:32:46,717 --> 01:32:48,981
Hey! Why are you looking
here and there!

1835
01:32:49,052 --> 01:32:50,314
Ma'am! Ma'am!

1836
01:32:50,988 --> 01:32:53,320
Ma'am is nowhere to be seen!
- Why?

1837
01:32:53,991 --> 01:32:55,322
I have to give milk!

1838
01:32:55,993 --> 01:32:58,461
Can't you see this? Give it in this!

1839
01:32:58,996 --> 01:33:00,395
Who are you?

1840
01:33:00,998 --> 01:33:03,125
You know ma'am but not sir!

1841
01:33:04,601 --> 01:33:08,002
You see, when I see her face
early in the morning...

1842
01:33:08,071 --> 01:33:11,131
...then my whole day goes fine.

1843
01:33:11,341 --> 01:33:13,138
Ma'am!
- Leave!

1844
01:33:14,211 --> 01:33:17,146
How can I leave without
seeing madam's face?

1845
01:33:17,214 --> 01:33:18,272
That's true!

1846
01:33:18,348 --> 01:33:19,610
What are you doing?

1847
01:33:20,017 --> 01:33:22,747
If I don't see madam's face,
my day won't go fine!

1848
01:33:25,022 --> 01:33:29,015
So I said of what use is the
wife whom others like.

1849
01:33:30,494 --> 01:33:31,552
Good one!

1850
01:33:32,029 --> 01:33:34,497
Sir! Sir! You and here?

1851
01:33:35,299 --> 01:33:38,757
I was passing by so I thought
I will meet you.

1852
01:33:39,770 --> 01:33:41,032
I see! Sir, here!

1853
01:33:41,505 --> 01:33:42,563
Please! Please!
- Here!

1854
01:33:42,639 --> 01:33:44,300
Yes! Please! Please! Okay!

1855
01:33:51,181 --> 01:33:53,706
Sir, we tolerate each other for
the whole week in the bank.

1856
01:33:55,252 --> 01:33:59,120
I see you everyday. But today
I wanted to see her.

1857
01:33:59,189 --> 01:34:00,451
So I came here. For a change.

1858
01:34:00,524 --> 01:34:01,650
Sir, this is not a changing room.

1859
01:34:01,725 --> 01:34:03,659
This is my house and she is my wife.

1860
01:34:04,061 --> 01:34:07,053
I know she is your wife. But
she is beautiful. Khushi...

1861
01:34:07,130 --> 01:34:08,791
Not Khushi. Your sister-in-law!
Your sister-in-law!

1862
01:34:09,066 --> 01:34:11,534
Santosh, your boss is a nice man.

1863
01:34:11,601 --> 01:34:13,660
But he is very sad. He is married.

1864
01:34:13,737 --> 01:34:17,070
But there is no love and
peace in his house.

1865
01:34:17,274 --> 01:34:21,404
And look at me. There is
contentment and joy in my house.

1866
01:34:24,348 --> 01:34:25,406
Phone!

1867
01:34:27,351 --> 01:34:28,409
Phone!

1868
01:34:28,685 --> 01:34:30,744
Hello! - Have you become
the phone operator?

1869
01:34:31,088 --> 01:34:32,146
You always answer the phone.

1870
01:34:32,689 --> 01:34:34,213
Give the phone to the hot babe.

1871
01:34:34,424 --> 01:34:35,618
Are you a married man?

1872
01:34:36,159 --> 01:34:37,751
No!
- Then hang up!

1873
01:34:38,095 --> 01:34:39,357
Is there no other wife in the world?

1874
01:34:39,429 --> 01:34:40,623
Why do you harass my wife?

1875
01:34:41,231 --> 01:34:42,823
Khurana has a wife. Prem has a wife.

1876
01:34:43,100 --> 01:34:45,159
Shall I give their numbers! Numbers!

1877
01:34:45,502 --> 01:34:47,094
Hello! He disconnected!

1878
01:34:50,173 --> 01:34:52,107
Santosh, how do you
tolerate all that?

1879
01:34:52,442 --> 01:34:55,104
If Khushi had been my
wife then by now...

1880
01:34:55,178 --> 01:34:57,112
...I would have committed
4-5 murders for her!

1881
01:34:59,516 --> 01:35:04,852
Sir... if you are not happy then
don't ruin other's happiness too.

1882
01:35:05,255 --> 01:35:08,247
I mean don't imagine other's
wife as your wife.

1883
01:35:09,126 --> 01:35:10,184
Sir, this is a crime.

1884
01:35:10,260 --> 01:35:12,194
And you might be punished
for this crime too.

1885
01:35:12,329 --> 01:35:13,387
You don't understand.

1886
01:35:15,399 --> 01:35:16,457
Good morning, sir.

1887
01:35:17,467 --> 01:35:18,525
Wow!

1888
01:35:19,603 --> 01:35:20,661
Let's go!

1889
01:35:20,871 --> 01:35:22,133
Wow! Look at that!

1890
01:35:30,547 --> 01:35:31,605
Show me this one!

1891
01:35:35,285 --> 01:35:36,343
This one!

1892
01:35:36,420 --> 01:35:39,218
Listen, you can leave her
hand and show her the ring!

1893
01:35:39,890 --> 01:35:42,688
Right? Do you show the
ring holding the hand!

1894
01:35:43,160 --> 01:35:44,889
Leave her hand! Take this! Let's go!

1895
01:35:45,162 --> 01:35:47,153
What are you doing? Sit!

1896
01:35:47,230 --> 01:35:49,289
He doesn't know how to show rings!

1897
01:35:49,499 --> 01:35:50,761
Show me that necklace!
- Which one?

1898
01:35:50,834 --> 01:35:52,631
That necklace! That one!

1899
01:35:53,170 --> 01:35:54,228
That one!

1900
01:35:55,906 --> 01:35:57,168
It must be expensive!

1901
01:35:57,240 --> 01:35:59,572
Ma'am, stand up. Please. Stand up.

1902
01:36:00,310 --> 01:36:03,768
Please stand up. Now I will put
the necklace around your neck!

1903
01:36:05,449 --> 01:36:06,507
It's so beautiful!

1904
01:36:06,583 --> 01:36:07,641
What? What?

1905
01:36:08,185 --> 01:36:10,380
What? Will you cling
to her? Like this!

1906
01:36:10,454 --> 01:36:11,512
Sir, I was putting the necklace
around her neck!

1907
01:36:11,588 --> 01:36:12,782
This is our job!

1908
01:36:12,856 --> 01:36:14,653
What happily? Her name is Khushi!

1909
01:36:15,192 --> 01:36:16,250
Are you putting the necklace
around her neck or you are...

1910
01:36:16,326 --> 01:36:17,384
...making arrangement
of your honeymoon!

1911
01:36:17,527 --> 01:36:18,585
It would have been
better if you had...

1912
01:36:18,662 --> 01:36:19,720
...put 'Mangalsutra' around her neck!

1913
01:36:19,796 --> 01:36:20,922
Sir, try to understand!
- Will you cling to her?

1914
01:36:21,198 --> 01:36:22,256
What are you doing? Come on!

1915
01:36:22,599 --> 01:36:24,464
What are you?
- Come on!

1916
01:36:24,601 --> 01:36:25,659
Ordinary man!

1917
01:36:25,735 --> 01:36:29,193
Beautiful damsels rob us.

1918
01:36:29,272 --> 01:36:30,330
Black tresses.

1919
01:36:30,407 --> 01:36:34,275
What a babe! Fantastic!

1920
01:36:34,344 --> 01:36:38,280
Wow! What a babe! Superb!

1921
01:36:38,882 --> 01:36:41,476
Turn around!

1922
01:36:42,219 --> 01:36:43,481
Bhai, what a babe!
- Shut up!

1923
01:36:44,554 --> 01:36:45,816
Bhai, look there!

1924
01:36:46,957 --> 01:36:49,687
Wow! What a babe!

1925
01:36:50,227 --> 01:36:51,353
Really hot!

1926
01:36:51,428 --> 01:36:52,827
She is so hot!

1927
01:36:52,896 --> 01:36:54,227
Turn around!

1928
01:36:54,364 --> 01:36:55,422
What a babe!

1929
01:36:58,235 --> 01:36:59,759
What a babe!

1930
01:36:59,836 --> 01:37:02,566
Circuit, she is hotter than her!
- What happened?

1931
01:37:03,240 --> 01:37:06,232
She stole my heart
using ten excuses.

1932
01:37:06,443 --> 01:37:07,501
She stole my heart
using ten excuses.

1933
01:37:07,577 --> 01:37:08,839
You go home. Let me handle them!

1934
01:37:08,912 --> 01:37:09,970
No, no! Let it be! We will go!

1935
01:37:10,247 --> 01:37:13,239
No, no! You go home. I
will handle them! Okay!

1936
01:37:14,985 --> 01:37:17,510
Take care! Okay!
- Yes! Okay!

1937
01:37:19,256 --> 01:37:20,450
Bhai, he is coming! He is coming!

1938
01:37:20,857 --> 01:37:23,451
What's going on? What's
your problem?

1939
01:37:24,261 --> 01:37:28,721
The problem is that... our
bhai... he is in love.

1940
01:37:29,266 --> 01:37:32,463
Help him get his gal. We
will give you your share.

1941
01:37:32,536 --> 01:37:34,868
I am not a lover. I am her husband.

1942
01:37:34,938 --> 01:37:37,406
Husband? What husband?

1943
01:37:37,474 --> 01:37:39,669
Love ends after marriage.

1944
01:37:39,876 --> 01:37:43,277
What do you people think!
- Think!

1945
01:37:43,346 --> 01:37:45,280
Yes!
- Bhai, he is that same man!

1946
01:37:45,682 --> 01:37:47,616
He was talking to us on the phone!

1947
01:37:47,684 --> 01:37:51,415
I see! So you are the one
who called up! - Yes!

1948
01:37:51,688 --> 01:37:53,747
You people called up!
- Yes!

1949
01:37:53,823 --> 01:37:55,757
What will you do?
- What will I do?

1950
01:37:56,293 --> 01:37:58,625
I will thrash you black and blue!

1951
01:37:58,695 --> 01:38:01,027
You won't be able to face people!

1952
01:38:07,304 --> 01:38:08,703
How much will you dress up?

1953
01:38:09,306 --> 01:38:10,705
How much will you make me go mad?

1954
01:38:10,774 --> 01:38:13,299
The whole locality
is smitten by you.

1955
01:38:13,710 --> 01:38:17,771
So Khushi, you won't venture
out of this house!

1956
01:38:18,915 --> 01:38:20,644
Why? Why won't I?

1957
01:38:20,784 --> 01:38:23,514
Am I your husband or your bodyguard?

1958
01:38:23,853 --> 01:38:25,320
I am guarding you from everybody.

1959
01:38:25,589 --> 01:38:28,456
Have I got married for
my sake or for others?

1960
01:38:28,725 --> 01:38:29,919
Everybody wants to talk to you.

1961
01:38:29,993 --> 01:38:31,460
Every man wants to tease you.

1962
01:38:32,996 --> 01:38:35,521
I thought I will be so happy
after marrying you.

1963
01:38:35,865 --> 01:38:38,459
But I have lost joy and peace too.

1964
01:38:38,602 --> 01:38:43,005
So listen to me carefully. You
will have to live here only!

1965
01:38:43,340 --> 01:38:46,070
Listen! I won't live! I
won't live! I won't live!

1966
01:38:46,409 --> 01:38:48,001
How will you not live here? How?

1967
01:38:48,345 --> 01:38:51,337
I am your husband! You will
have to listen to me!

1968
01:38:52,549 --> 01:38:53,743
What the hell is wrong with you?

1969
01:38:54,684 --> 01:38:55,742
You are so drunk!

1970
01:38:55,819 --> 01:38:56,877
Mr. Singh, what are you doing?

1971
01:38:56,953 --> 01:38:59,012
You are doing the wrong thing.
She is not your wife.

1972
01:39:00,357 --> 01:39:01,415
Have you gone mad?

1973
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:05,089
I... I am his wife!

1974
01:39:05,629 --> 01:39:07,358
Sorry, sister-in-law! Sorry, sir!

1975
01:39:07,430 --> 01:39:09,489
By mistake in my imagination...

1976
01:39:10,834 --> 01:39:11,892
Sorry, sir! Sorry, sir!

1977
01:39:11,968 --> 01:39:13,367
Okay! Okay! Okay!
- I am really sorry!

1978
01:39:13,436 --> 01:39:14,903
I know what he is talking
about! I am sorry!

1979
01:39:14,971 --> 01:39:16,495
What!
- I am sorry on his behalf!

1980
01:39:16,573 --> 01:39:18,097
He is imagining in his stupor.

1981
01:39:18,508 --> 01:39:20,635
Sister-in-law, I know him.
He is a nice man.

1982
01:39:20,710 --> 01:39:21,768
What are you doing?

1983
01:39:21,845 --> 01:39:23,904
He always says sister-in-law
is bloody fool!

1984
01:39:24,514 --> 01:39:27,711
Beautiful! I never said bloody
fool! Will you get me fired!

1985
01:39:28,385 --> 01:39:29,443
Sister-in-law is beautiful!
- Shut up!

1986
01:39:29,519 --> 01:39:30,577
What rubbish!

1987
01:39:31,655 --> 01:39:33,384
And you... did you call me here to...

1988
01:39:33,456 --> 01:39:36,118
...insult me in front of everybody.

1989
01:39:36,393 --> 01:39:37,985
Forgive me.
- And this man...

1990
01:39:38,728 --> 01:39:39,786
Yes! Sister-in-law, sorry. Please!

1991
01:39:39,863 --> 01:39:43,390
He is imagining me as his wife
and he is talking rubbish...

1992
01:39:43,466 --> 01:39:44,524
I made a mistake!

1993
01:39:44,601 --> 01:39:47,001
Shut up! And you are
quietly watching it!

1994
01:39:48,938 --> 01:39:52,135
You are shameless, Prem!
You are shameless!

1995
01:39:55,078 --> 01:39:56,409
Sir! Sir! Sir, we will manage it!

1996
01:39:56,946 --> 01:39:58,743
Take him away from here!

1997
01:39:59,549 --> 01:40:00,743
Get out! And don't come back!

1998
01:40:03,420 --> 01:40:05,411
Khushi! O my God!

1999
01:40:07,023 --> 01:40:08,149
What has happened to him?

2000
01:40:09,025 --> 01:40:11,084
All this is happening because
of Shanti sister-in-law!

2001
01:40:13,830 --> 01:40:16,560
She thinks I am having
an affair with Santosh.

2002
01:40:19,035 --> 01:40:20,434
Now I will have to do something.

2003
01:40:21,037 --> 01:40:24,165
Why did you let him go? Shall
I put him behind bars?

2004
01:40:26,443 --> 01:40:31,437
No, Mr. Waghmare. That idiot is
ill. He is fed up of his wife.

2005
01:40:32,182 --> 01:40:33,444
If he is fed up of his wife,
then will he...

2006
01:40:33,516 --> 01:40:35,984
...make other's wife his wife!

2007
01:40:36,453 --> 01:40:37,511
He is a dangerous man!

2008
01:40:38,588 --> 01:40:41,989
Let it be! I am really sorry!
You enjoy the party!

2009
01:40:42,992 --> 01:40:45,187
I will go and mollify
Khushi! I will try!

2010
01:40:45,462 --> 01:40:47,657
How to enjoy?
- Please carry on! Carry on!

2011
01:40:47,731 --> 01:40:51,462
Listen! People imagine other's
wife as their wife!

2012
01:40:51,801 --> 01:40:52,859
Yes! Yes!

2013
01:40:52,936 --> 01:40:54,460
Let's go. Here the ambience
is not fine.

2014
01:40:54,537 --> 01:40:55,595
What do you mean!

2015
01:40:55,672 --> 01:40:57,537
Take a look at your condition!

2016
01:40:57,607 --> 01:40:58,665
I had asked you to drink a quarter...

2017
01:40:58,742 --> 01:40:59,868
...and create a stir at the house.

2018
01:40:59,943 --> 01:41:02,673
But you created a chaos
at the boss's house!

2019
01:41:02,746 --> 01:41:04,475
I didn't know Mr. Mishra
that just a quarter...

2020
01:41:04,547 --> 01:41:06,538
...will knock me out of my senses.

2021
01:41:06,616 --> 01:41:08,550
And I will mistake the boss's
wife for my wife.

2022
01:41:08,618 --> 01:41:09,676
Forget it! What had to
happen has happened.

2023
01:41:09,753 --> 01:41:10,879
Let's go home, and...

2024
01:41:11,488 --> 01:41:13,012
No, no not at home.

2025
01:41:13,089 --> 01:41:15,023
The matter has become very severe.

2026
01:41:15,091 --> 01:41:16,490
Even though if I have to
sleep on the streets...

2027
01:41:16,559 --> 01:41:17,617
...I won't go home.

2028
01:41:17,694 --> 01:41:18,752
What are you doing? Get up!

2029
01:41:18,828 --> 01:41:19,886
You are from a descent family!

2030
01:41:19,963 --> 01:41:21,021
This... get up!

2031
01:41:21,097 --> 01:41:22,223
Why would you sleep on the footpath!

2032
01:41:22,499 --> 01:41:25,024
Come on, let's go home and I will
do sentimental with your wife.

2033
01:41:25,101 --> 01:41:27,501
You will get sentimental
with my wife. - No, no!

2034
01:41:27,570 --> 01:41:28,696
You mean settlement!

2035
01:41:28,772 --> 01:41:30,569
And it is not that easy
to do a settlement!

2036
01:41:31,040 --> 01:41:34,840
Listen, don't take all
the decisions here.

2037
01:41:34,911 --> 01:41:37,903
Let's go home, it is night time.

2038
01:41:37,981 --> 01:41:41,041
Why did you tighten it
so hard around my neck?

2039
01:41:46,923 --> 01:41:51,587
These distances make me
suffer every moment!

2040
01:41:51,661 --> 01:41:55,927
It pierces the heart, it doesn't
let me be in peace at night.

2041
01:41:58,868 --> 01:42:03,601
The heart slumbers.

2042
01:42:03,673 --> 01:42:08,076
But your memories stay
awake with me!

2043
01:42:09,746 --> 01:42:12,613
How can I tell you?

2044
01:42:12,682 --> 01:42:18,279
I cannot live without
you, my beloved.

2045
01:42:18,555 --> 01:42:20,079
O my beloved!

2046
01:42:22,892 --> 01:42:27,295
These distances make me
suffer every moment!

2047
01:42:27,564 --> 01:42:32,160
It pierces the heart, it doesn't
let me be in peace at night.

2048
01:42:45,715 --> 01:42:49,845
The ambience is colourless!

2049
01:42:51,120 --> 01:42:55,921
The atmosphere is colourless!

2050
01:42:57,193 --> 01:43:00,128
The ambience is colourless!

2051
01:43:00,196 --> 01:43:03,188
You are my happiness!

2052
01:43:06,669 --> 01:43:09,331
Life seems so difficult!

2053
01:43:09,606 --> 01:43:12,131
Without you, my beloved!

2054
01:43:12,208 --> 01:43:14,005
My beloved!

2055
01:43:17,013 --> 01:43:21,347
These distances make me
suffer every moment!

2056
01:43:21,618 --> 01:43:25,816
It pierces the heart, it doesn't
let me be in peace at night.

2057
01:43:32,629 --> 01:43:33,687
What are you doing?

2058
01:43:35,632 --> 01:43:36,690
What are you doing?

2059
01:43:36,766 --> 01:43:37,824
Stop it Prem!

2060
01:43:38,167 --> 01:43:41,159
I cannot live another
minute in this house?

2061
01:43:43,773 --> 01:43:44,831
But why?

2062
01:43:45,775 --> 01:43:46,833
Why?

2063
01:43:47,043 --> 01:43:49,637
Because, even though I
refused so many times.

2064
01:43:49,712 --> 01:43:51,839
You gave me the same simple gift
in front of all the guests.

2065
01:43:54,250 --> 01:43:56,184
I am a simple man Khushi!

2066
01:43:57,787 --> 01:44:00,722
A simple bank manager
whom you have married.

2067
01:44:03,793 --> 01:44:05,852
That was the biggest
mistake of my life.

2068
01:44:06,729 --> 01:44:08,720
And because of that I
am repenting till now.

2069
01:44:11,668 --> 01:44:12,726
Just...

2070
01:44:14,804 --> 01:44:15,998
Just for a gift!

2071
01:44:16,072 --> 01:44:17,130
What?

2072
01:44:18,074 --> 01:44:21,805
And you don't regret about whatever
happened in the party?

2073
01:44:21,878 --> 01:44:24,403
I scolded him a lot after you
left from the party, Khushi!

2074
01:44:25,014 --> 01:44:26,072
I threw him out!

2075
01:44:27,216 --> 01:44:28,683
Thank you so much Prem!

2076
01:44:28,751 --> 01:44:30,013
So sweet of you!

2077
01:44:30,687 --> 01:44:32,086
What else could I have done!

2078
01:44:32,155 --> 01:44:34,214
Killed him!
- Yes!

2079
01:44:35,692 --> 01:44:37,023
Yes Prem, you should
have killed him!

2080
01:44:38,761 --> 01:44:41,889
What would have the people
in the party thought?

2081
01:44:42,231 --> 01:44:44,096
That my husband is a...
- Stop it.

2082
01:44:44,701 --> 01:44:46,100
Nothing like that has
happened Khushi!

2083
01:44:46,169 --> 01:44:48,228
Prem, it might not be
anything for you.

2084
01:44:48,905 --> 01:44:50,770
But for me, it is a
very shameful thing.

2085
01:44:51,841 --> 01:44:54,241
If a husband cannot
protect his wife.

2086
01:44:54,844 --> 01:44:58,109
Then it is futile to spend
your life with him, Prem.

2087
01:44:58,781 --> 01:45:00,112
I don't want that Prem.

2088
01:45:02,852 --> 01:45:06,117
Please leave me.

2089
01:45:11,060 --> 01:45:12,118
I want a divorce.

2090
01:45:12,195 --> 01:45:16,928
Your arms were my home!

2091
01:45:18,134 --> 01:45:23,128
My journey was so nice.

2092
01:45:24,073 --> 01:45:26,940
Your arms were my home!

2093
01:45:27,010 --> 01:45:29,945
My journey was so nice.

2094
01:45:30,279 --> 01:45:36,149
Without you I was breathless.

2095
01:45:38,154 --> 01:45:41,282
That's all that remained to hear.

2096
01:45:43,760 --> 01:45:48,163
These distances make me
suffer every moment!

2097
01:45:48,231 --> 01:45:51,894
It pierces the heart, it doesn't
let me be in peace at night.

2098
01:45:51,968 --> 01:45:53,367
Till today I only wanted
your happiness.

2099
01:45:55,304 --> 01:45:57,499
I gave you everything you desired.

2100
01:45:59,108 --> 01:46:00,166
I will give you a divorce too.

2101
01:46:05,114 --> 01:46:06,513
I just want you to be happy.

2102
01:46:09,786 --> 01:46:10,844
But there is a tension of one thing.

2103
01:46:12,321 --> 01:46:13,982
Who will you test after the divorce?

2104
01:46:19,796 --> 01:46:22,321
Who will praise your spicy food?

2105
01:46:24,801 --> 01:46:27,861
Who will forget his own sorrows
to keep you happy?

2106
01:46:30,206 --> 01:46:32,868
Who will harass himself in
front of the world for you?

2107
01:46:32,942 --> 01:46:35,342
Who will...

2108
01:46:37,814 --> 01:46:38,872
I don't believe I am crying?

2109
01:46:41,217 --> 01:46:44,812
When someone fills that place
in your life, then let me know.

2110
01:46:46,422 --> 01:46:47,548
I will divorce you.

2111
01:46:49,158 --> 01:46:50,887
I will go far away from your life.

2112
01:47:05,842 --> 01:47:07,241
I am really sorry Prem!

2113
01:47:08,377 --> 01:47:09,901
Baby, please forgive me.

2114
01:47:12,849 --> 01:47:18,048
I have realised today, what
all you did to keep me happy.

2115
01:47:20,056 --> 01:47:22,047
No one else can love
you more than me.

2116
01:47:22,125 --> 01:47:23,387
No one else!

2117
01:47:25,862 --> 01:47:26,988
I really love you Prem!

2118
01:47:29,866 --> 01:47:31,060
I love you sweetheart!

2119
01:47:32,201 --> 01:47:33,259
I love you.

2120
01:47:34,203 --> 01:47:35,261
That's your name.

2121
01:47:40,409 --> 01:47:41,467
I love you!

2122
01:47:49,418 --> 01:47:50,476
Rickshaw!

2123
01:47:50,887 --> 01:47:52,286
Mr. Abdul, so late in the night!

2124
01:47:52,355 --> 01:47:57,088
My wife threw me out
of the house. - Why?

2125
01:47:57,160 --> 01:48:01,893
I just told her, last night you
were abusing me in your sleep.

2126
01:48:01,964 --> 01:48:03,295
See.

2127
01:48:03,366 --> 01:48:06,426
You know what she said to me?

2128
01:48:06,502 --> 01:48:09,096
You were mistaken that I was asleep.

2129
01:48:09,172 --> 01:48:10,901
I lost my mind, I slapped her once...

2130
01:48:10,973 --> 01:48:12,304
...and she slapped me thrice.

2131
01:48:12,375 --> 01:48:14,969
And she handed me my
bed and threw me out.

2132
01:48:15,044 --> 01:48:16,102
Said, Abdul get out of the house

2133
01:48:16,179 --> 01:48:17,237
Now I am on the footpath.

2134
01:48:17,313 --> 01:48:18,371
Now I will go wherever
you will. Sit.

2135
01:48:18,447 --> 01:48:20,312
Come on.
- Did you see? - That's his problem!

2136
01:48:20,383 --> 01:48:21,441
No, but did you see?

2137
01:48:21,517 --> 01:48:22,916
There is a Shanti in every house...

2138
01:48:22,985 --> 01:48:24,919
...that has ruined the serenity.

2139
01:48:24,987 --> 01:48:26,045
Come in! Come in!

2140
01:48:26,122 --> 01:48:27,180
Come in!
- Let us all become ascetics!

2141
01:48:27,256 --> 01:48:28,314
Come on!

2142
01:48:28,391 --> 01:48:30,325
Come on.

2143
01:48:30,393 --> 01:48:31,655
But where?

2144
01:48:33,129 --> 01:48:35,996
Take me to the moon, to hell!

2145
01:48:36,065 --> 01:48:37,123
Take me wherever you wish too.

2146
01:48:37,200 --> 01:48:38,997
Take me anywhere except
for my house.

2147
01:48:39,068 --> 01:48:40,126
Come on.

2148
01:48:40,203 --> 01:48:41,932
But where else will we go?

2149
01:48:42,004 --> 01:48:43,995
Why are you worried, I am there!

2150
01:48:44,340 --> 01:48:47,332
My name is Abdul, I keep
all the information!

2151
01:48:47,543 --> 01:48:49,943
I will take you to such a place...

2152
01:48:50,012 --> 01:48:54,540
...you will feel that it
is day even in the night.

2153
01:49:02,291 --> 01:49:03,349
Come in!

2154
01:49:04,427 --> 01:49:05,485
Hello!

2155
01:49:05,561 --> 01:49:07,085
Come, come, come!

2156
01:49:07,163 --> 01:49:08,494
Everyone knows me here!

2157
01:49:08,564 --> 01:49:10,031
Greetings sir.
- Greetings.

2158
01:49:10,099 --> 01:49:12,158
Come.

2159
01:49:12,435 --> 01:49:13,493
Come on.

2160
01:49:20,509 --> 01:49:22,374
Where have you brought me Abdul?

2161
01:49:22,511 --> 01:49:27,039
This is the place where every
wounded heart comes for peace.

2162
01:49:27,116 --> 01:49:28,981
How can there be peace here?

2163
01:49:29,051 --> 01:49:30,177
You will find it here!

2164
01:49:30,253 --> 01:49:32,050
She dances so well!

2165
01:49:32,121 --> 01:49:37,320
Everyone here has come for that!

2166
01:49:37,393 --> 01:49:39,054
You didn't tell me!

2167
01:49:39,128 --> 01:49:40,186
What?

2168
01:49:40,997 --> 01:49:42,055
Since when did sister-in-law...

2169
01:49:42,398 --> 01:49:43,456
What do you mean, since
when sister-in-law!

2170
01:49:43,532 --> 01:49:47,127
I mean, since when did
she start dancing.

2171
01:49:48,004 --> 01:49:49,062
Here she comes.

2172
01:49:50,539 --> 01:49:51,597
Sit!

2173
01:49:58,481 --> 01:50:01,609
Shanti!

2174
01:50:11,560 --> 01:50:14,028
Fly me away!

2175
01:50:16,032 --> 01:50:18,227
Steal me away!

2176
01:50:20,036 --> 01:50:21,765
Fly me away!

2177
01:50:22,038 --> 01:50:23,630
Steal me away!

2178
01:50:24,040 --> 01:50:27,635
Adorn me with all the
ornaments of love.

2179
01:50:28,044 --> 01:50:33,448
Immerse me in your heart,
and take me home.

2180
01:50:33,516 --> 01:50:35,245
Take me home!

2181
01:50:35,318 --> 01:50:39,118
Take me home!

2182
01:50:39,188 --> 01:50:43,454
Take me home!

2183
01:50:43,526 --> 01:50:45,255
What are you doing sir,
she is my wife!

2184
01:50:45,328 --> 01:50:48,126
Did I say anything when
you imagined my wife?

2185
01:50:48,197 --> 01:50:49,255
Sir!

2186
01:50:49,332 --> 01:50:51,459
Take me home!

2187
01:50:51,534 --> 01:50:55,197
Take me home!

2188
01:50:55,271 --> 01:50:59,674
Take me home!

2189
01:51:00,476 --> 01:51:03,604
Aren't you ashamed, she is my wife!

2190
01:51:04,080 --> 01:51:06,480
You want to score a goal
on the first day.

2191
01:51:07,149 --> 01:51:08,207
Are you mad?

2192
01:51:08,284 --> 01:51:09,342
Anyone.

2193
01:51:09,418 --> 01:51:10,476
Shut up.

2194
01:51:10,553 --> 01:51:12,077
Come on!

2195
01:51:12,154 --> 01:51:14,145
Leave me!
- What are you doing?

2196
01:51:14,223 --> 01:51:16,157
Leave my hand!
- Come on, let's go home!

2197
01:51:16,225 --> 01:51:18,159
Aren't you ashamed to dance in
front of everyone like this?

2198
01:51:18,227 --> 01:51:19,285
Leave my hand!

2199
01:51:19,362 --> 01:51:21,159
Leave her!

2200
01:51:21,230 --> 01:51:22,697
What is it?
- What is it?

2201
01:51:23,099 --> 01:51:24,157
Where are you taking my dancer?

2202
01:51:24,233 --> 01:51:26,167
She is my wife, I can take
her wherever I want!

2203
01:51:26,235 --> 01:51:27,293
She is your wife, she is my dancer.

2204
01:51:27,370 --> 01:51:29,497
Sir is standing outside, call him.

2205
01:51:29,572 --> 01:51:30,630
Call him!

2206
01:51:31,440 --> 01:51:32,634
Why are you getting involved
with the police?

2207
01:51:32,708 --> 01:51:33,766
Where do they come from?

2208
01:51:33,843 --> 01:51:36,175
No, no there is a misunderstanding!

2209
01:51:36,245 --> 01:51:38,645
You dare lock horns with Anna!

2210
01:51:38,714 --> 01:51:41,182
I will teach you a lesson.

2211
01:51:41,250 --> 01:51:42,308
I will kill you!

2212
01:51:42,385 --> 01:51:44,649
The police will come and
teach you a lesson!

2213
01:51:44,720 --> 01:51:45,778
Sorry sister.

2214
01:51:46,122 --> 01:51:47,180
Just watch!

2215
01:51:47,256 --> 01:51:48,518
I am here!

2216
01:51:48,591 --> 01:51:49,649
Calm down!

2217
01:51:49,725 --> 01:51:51,522
Anna, what is the matter?
What's going on?

2218
01:51:52,128 --> 01:51:56,724
Inspector, this man brought
this boy here.

2219
01:51:58,667 --> 01:52:00,532
You! Condition!

2220
01:52:01,270 --> 01:52:02,532
I had told you.

2221
01:52:02,605 --> 01:52:05,335
The day I catch you, I will
reform your condition!

2222
01:52:05,741 --> 01:52:07,675
What did you do, tell me?

2223
01:52:07,743 --> 01:52:09,142
He brought him here!

2224
01:52:09,211 --> 01:52:11,202
And he was taking my girl
away as his wife.

2225
01:52:11,280 --> 01:52:13,145
There is a bit of misunderstanding.

2226
01:52:13,215 --> 01:52:14,273
Quiet!
- Quiet!

2227
01:52:14,350 --> 01:52:16,147
What misunderstanding?

2228
01:52:16,552 --> 01:52:20,283
You consider any girl as your wife.
- No!

2229
01:52:20,689 --> 01:52:22,213
Quiet!
- Constable!

2230
01:52:22,291 --> 01:52:24,156
Inspector, they were
along with him too

2231
01:52:24,226 --> 01:52:25,750
Take them away to rot in jail.

2232
01:52:25,828 --> 01:52:27,557
Okay, okay I am here now.

2233
01:52:28,164 --> 01:52:29,825
Come on, now you will
be jailed for long.

2234
01:52:29,899 --> 01:52:31,161
Constable.
- Take them away!

2235
01:52:31,233 --> 01:52:32,564
Take them along too.

2236
01:52:32,635 --> 01:52:34,569
Come on.

2237
01:52:37,573 --> 01:52:39,165
Let's settle this.

2238
01:52:39,241 --> 01:52:40,299
Take them away.

2239
01:52:40,376 --> 01:52:41,434
Go from here, don't stand here.

2240
01:52:41,510 --> 01:52:42,704
Come on.
- Be careful, idiots.

2241
01:52:43,179 --> 01:52:44,703
Start the music.

2242
01:52:44,780 --> 01:52:47,715
Sit all of you, enjoy!

2243
01:52:49,251 --> 01:52:51,378
Calm down!

2244
01:52:51,454 --> 01:52:52,785
Dance.

2245
01:52:52,855 --> 01:52:53,913
Go!

2246
01:53:08,204 --> 01:53:13,608
Shanti, think before
taking any decision!

2247
01:53:13,676 --> 01:53:15,405
I have thought about it.

2248
01:53:15,744 --> 01:53:17,939
It is your misunderstanding.

2249
01:53:18,347 --> 01:53:20,212
I have seen it with my own eyes.

2250
01:53:20,282 --> 01:53:22,273
He doesn't have any time for me.

2251
01:53:22,351 --> 01:53:25,616
But he was taking her for shopping,
buying her necklace.

2252
01:53:26,355 --> 01:53:28,619
Meaning, you won't listen.

2253
01:53:29,758 --> 01:53:31,953
I have decided that I
am going back to Kota.

2254
01:53:33,829 --> 01:53:36,297
And this is your last decision.

2255
01:53:37,233 --> 01:53:38,291
Yes.

2256
01:53:39,235 --> 01:53:40,293
Fine!

2257
01:53:40,769 --> 01:53:42,828
Then I will take you to the station!

2258
01:53:43,239 --> 01:53:44,297
Come on.

2259
01:53:47,376 --> 01:53:50,834
Come on.
- Khurana, what are you doing?

2260
01:53:51,580 --> 01:53:53,980
You should explain Shanti!

2261
01:53:54,583 --> 01:53:57,313
Instead you are taking her side.

2262
01:53:57,386 --> 01:54:00,321
There is no need to
explain her anything.

2263
01:54:00,656 --> 01:54:01,850
She is quite sensible.

2264
01:54:01,924 --> 01:54:03,653
Isn't it Shanti, you are
sensible isn't it!

2265
01:54:04,260 --> 01:54:05,318
Come let's go.

2266
01:54:05,861 --> 01:54:08,261
Mr. Khurana, I was thinking
that I should meet Santosh...

2267
01:54:08,330 --> 01:54:10,798
...once before leaving.

2268
01:54:11,267 --> 01:54:13,462
Otherwise he will think
I just left slyly.

2269
01:54:15,738 --> 01:54:16,796
Okay!

2270
01:54:17,273 --> 01:54:18,467
What has happened?

2271
01:54:18,874 --> 01:54:20,341
We are defamed.

2272
01:54:24,680 --> 01:54:27,808
Lord, our image will be tarnished.

2273
01:54:35,424 --> 01:54:36,823
Get lost.

2274
01:54:37,293 --> 01:54:39,022
Don't talk with criminals.

2275
01:54:42,765 --> 01:54:43,823
I had to see this day too.

2276
01:54:43,899 --> 01:54:45,366
All this happened because of you!

2277
01:54:46,302 --> 01:54:49,499
You created the mess,
why are you blaming me?

2278
01:54:49,572 --> 01:54:51,506
Why do you flame each other!

2279
01:54:51,574 --> 01:54:54,042
Not flame, blame.
- Blame

2280
01:54:54,376 --> 01:54:57,311
Sir!
- What is it, tell me?

2281
01:54:57,379 --> 01:54:59,313
Sir, how long will we
have to sit here?

2282
01:54:59,381 --> 01:55:00,439
Until senior sir doesn't arrive...

2283
01:55:00,516 --> 01:55:01,574
...we cannot take any decision
regarding your matter.

2284
01:55:01,650 --> 01:55:02,708
Understood.

2285
01:55:02,785 --> 01:55:05,310
And all of you will
be jailed for long.

2286
01:55:05,387 --> 01:55:07,048
What are you saying?

2287
01:55:07,389 --> 01:55:10,722
And seeing us, does it look
like we are urinal men!

2288
01:55:10,793 --> 01:55:11,919
What nonsense?

2289
01:55:12,661 --> 01:55:13,719
What are you saying?

2290
01:55:14,330 --> 01:55:16,924
My English! Tell him, do
we look like out-laws!

2291
01:55:16,999 --> 01:55:18,398
Criminal!

2292
01:55:18,467 --> 01:55:19,525
Say that!

2293
01:55:20,869 --> 01:55:23,394
Please let us go! Please leave us!

2294
01:55:23,472 --> 01:55:24,530
Do we look like that kind of people?

2295
01:55:24,607 --> 01:55:26,734
We haven't even brushed till now.

2296
01:55:26,809 --> 01:55:29,403
We will get STD!

2297
01:55:29,478 --> 01:55:30,877
He means acidity!

2298
01:55:30,946 --> 01:55:32,880
No matter what you have!

2299
01:55:32,948 --> 01:55:35,746
I cannot leave you before
senior sir arrives.

2300
01:55:35,818 --> 01:55:37,877
By the grace of Lord you are cheap!

2301
01:55:38,354 --> 01:55:39,412
What did you say?

2302
01:55:39,488 --> 01:55:40,546
I will tell you sir.

2303
01:55:41,357 --> 01:55:42,688
He meant chief!

2304
01:55:42,758 --> 01:55:43,816
Say like that.

2305
01:55:43,892 --> 01:55:44,950
Seems like sir has arrived.

2306
01:55:45,361 --> 01:55:48,888
This is not your bank, it is
the police station! - Sit there.

2307
01:55:48,964 --> 01:55:50,955
They will break your bones.

2308
01:55:51,033 --> 01:55:53,763
You are here for the first time,
but I've come here many times.

2309
01:55:53,836 --> 01:55:56,771
Do you see, these rickshaw
drivers abuse me too?

2310
01:56:16,392 --> 01:56:17,450
Shanti!

2311
01:56:17,526 --> 01:56:18,788
There is no news of Santosh!

2312
01:56:18,861 --> 01:56:19,919
How long will you wait?

2313
01:56:19,995 --> 01:56:21,053
You have a phone in your hand.

2314
01:56:21,130 --> 01:56:22,461
Dial his number, talk to him.

2315
01:56:22,931 --> 01:56:25,126
No, he never picks up my call!

2316
01:56:25,401 --> 01:56:26,663
Atleast try it.

2317
01:56:28,804 --> 01:56:30,601
No, I won't call.

2318
01:56:30,673 --> 01:56:32,937
If not you, then I will call.

2319
01:56:33,008 --> 01:56:34,066
Give me!

2320
01:56:34,410 --> 01:56:35,809
Greetings sir.

2321
01:56:36,412 --> 01:56:38,471
Commander, dial the residential
number for sister-in-law!

2322
01:56:38,547 --> 01:56:40,742
I will just come.
- Go!

2323
01:56:40,816 --> 01:56:42,408
Sir, how was the party last night?

2324
01:56:42,484 --> 01:56:44,475
There such a unfortunate man there...

2325
01:56:47,423 --> 01:56:48,481
You!

2326
01:56:49,558 --> 01:56:50,616
How did he come here?

2327
01:56:50,693 --> 01:56:53,628
Sir, I have arrested them from
the Night Queen club, sir.

2328
01:56:53,696 --> 01:56:54,754
Greetings sir.

2329
01:56:54,830 --> 01:56:56,821
You look like kings of night clubs.

2330
01:56:57,766 --> 01:56:58,960
You have this habit too!

2331
01:56:59,034 --> 01:57:01,559
No, sir I had gone there
just like that.

2332
01:57:01,637 --> 01:57:03,764
Sir he was calling the
dancer his wife.

2333
01:57:03,839 --> 01:57:04,965
I arrested him from there.

2334
01:57:05,441 --> 01:57:07,568
So another imagination.

2335
01:57:07,643 --> 01:57:09,634
You are a very dangerous man!

2336
01:57:09,978 --> 01:57:11,843
No one's wife is safe from you.

2337
01:57:12,448 --> 01:57:16,441
Can you make someone pregnant
in your imagination?

2338
01:57:16,518 --> 01:57:18,509
No, I haven't done something
like that!

2339
01:57:18,587 --> 01:57:19,781
So, you haven't done it till now.

2340
01:57:19,855 --> 01:57:21,516
Do you plan to do it
in the near future?

2341
01:57:21,590 --> 01:57:22,648
No, sir.

2342
01:57:22,725 --> 01:57:23,783
Did you make your call?

2343
01:57:23,859 --> 01:57:25,656
No darling, I cannot get through!

2344
01:57:25,861 --> 01:57:27,522
Go and sit in the car.

2345
01:57:27,596 --> 01:57:28,654
Take her to the car.

2346
01:57:28,731 --> 01:57:29,789
What are you saying?

2347
01:57:29,865 --> 01:57:32,459
You don't know what a
dangerous man he is.

2348
01:57:32,534 --> 01:57:33,660
Go, go.

2349
01:57:33,736 --> 01:57:35,863
What can he do?

2350
01:57:35,938 --> 01:57:39,465
He will make you pregnant
and I won't even know...

2351
01:57:39,541 --> 01:57:41,668
...in his imagination! Go!

2352
01:57:41,744 --> 01:57:44,076
Take her!
- I am going!

2353
01:57:44,146 --> 01:57:46,478
What were you looking at?

2354
01:57:47,483 --> 01:57:49,075
No sir, sister-in-law is very nice!

2355
01:57:49,818 --> 01:57:51,877
You scoundrel.
I'll put you behind the bars.

2356
01:57:51,954 --> 01:57:53,080
What are you here for?

2357
01:57:53,756 --> 01:57:55,485
Sir, I am the pilot
of the auto-rickshaw...

2358
01:57:55,557 --> 01:57:56,615
...I just went where
they asked me to take them.

2359
01:57:56,692 --> 01:57:58,557
I was unnecessarily dragged in this.

2360
01:57:58,627 --> 01:58:00,959
Fine him 500 rupees and let him go!

2361
01:58:01,029 --> 01:58:02,087
Go!

2362
01:58:02,164 --> 01:58:03,563
Go! Go!

2363
01:58:03,832 --> 01:58:05,094
Come here!

2364
01:58:05,901 --> 01:58:07,493
Constable, make a receipt
of 500 rupees.

2365
01:58:07,569 --> 01:58:10,094
You! You are his partner, isn't it?

2366
01:58:10,172 --> 01:58:11,230
No!

2367
01:58:12,508 --> 01:58:14,237
Sir, it is some girl's call.

2368
01:58:14,510 --> 01:58:15,568
Answer it!

2369
01:58:16,512 --> 01:58:17,638
Who is Shanti?

2370
01:58:17,713 --> 01:58:20,841
She is my wife, sir.
- Another imagination.

2371
01:58:20,916 --> 01:58:21,974
No sir, she is my wife.

2372
01:58:22,050 --> 01:58:26,248
You won't talk to anyone else until
a case is not filed against you!

2373
01:58:26,522 --> 01:58:28,854
Sir, how will I make you understand?

2374
01:58:29,124 --> 01:58:30,182
He disconnected it!

2375
01:58:30,259 --> 01:58:31,590
He disconnected the phone!

2376
01:58:31,660 --> 01:58:33,594
He will disconnect it
if you call from my phone.

2377
01:58:33,662 --> 01:58:34,924
Now try from your own phone.

2378
01:58:34,997 --> 01:58:36,589
From my phone, shall I try it!

2379
01:58:39,935 --> 01:58:40,993
Now he has switched off the phone!

2380
01:58:41,069 --> 01:58:42,127
Switched off!

2381
01:58:42,204 --> 01:58:43,262
He has done it knowingly!

2382
01:58:43,539 --> 01:58:44,938
He doesn't want to talk to me!

2383
01:58:45,007 --> 01:58:46,599
I am leaving without meeting him.

2384
01:58:54,883 --> 01:58:55,941
Shivani!

2385
01:58:56,885 --> 01:58:57,943
You have come here too!

2386
01:58:58,020 --> 01:58:59,078
Where have you left him!

2387
01:58:59,154 --> 01:59:01,554
Him! I have come to meet you!

2388
01:59:01,623 --> 01:59:02,954
Are you going anywhere?

2389
01:59:03,025 --> 01:59:05,755
Yes, I am leaving
this house forever!

2390
01:59:06,562 --> 01:59:09,554
Shanti, if you will
leave this house...

2391
01:59:09,631 --> 01:59:11,565
...then who will look after Santosh!

2392
01:59:11,633 --> 01:59:13,624
Now she is there to
look after Santosh!

2393
01:59:13,702 --> 01:59:16,170
That's enough Shanti!

2394
01:59:16,572 --> 01:59:17,630
Stop it!

2395
01:59:18,574 --> 01:59:21,168
And you, will you stay here?

2396
01:59:25,714 --> 01:59:28,842
You will stay here! In this house

2397
01:59:35,591 --> 01:59:36,853
Of course, I will stay here!

2398
01:59:39,127 --> 01:59:41,789
She will stay here!

2399
01:59:41,864 --> 01:59:44,662
As what relation?
- As the wife!

2400
01:59:44,733 --> 01:59:45,791
Why?

2401
01:59:45,868 --> 01:59:47,597
Has she married Santosh!
- No!

2402
01:59:48,003 --> 01:59:49,334
But she will!

2403
01:59:49,605 --> 01:59:51,334
She will turn this
house into heaven!

2404
01:59:51,607 --> 01:59:52,665
Isn't it Shivani?

2405
01:59:52,741 --> 01:59:54,606
Was this house hell till now?

2406
01:59:54,676 --> 01:59:56,143
Done delay anymore.

2407
01:59:56,612 --> 01:59:59,604
How dare Santosh leave
the real thing...

2408
01:59:59,681 --> 02:00:00,739
...and accept something that's fake.

2409
02:00:02,017 --> 02:00:03,678
Just a minute! Just
a minute Mr. Khurana!

2410
02:00:03,752 --> 02:00:04,810
What happened?

2411
02:00:04,887 --> 02:00:06,616
I feel I am leaving
something behind.

2412
02:00:06,688 --> 02:00:09,885
Shanti, you are leaving
a very dear thing behind.

2413
02:00:11,159 --> 02:00:12,956
Which maybe you can't see.

2414
02:00:14,162 --> 02:00:15,220
Husband's love.

2415
02:00:16,164 --> 02:00:17,290
A wife's rights.

2416
02:00:18,634 --> 02:00:19,896
The vows of the 7 nuptial rounds.

2417
02:00:21,036 --> 02:00:22,298
Did you forget all that?

2418
02:00:24,172 --> 02:00:26,367
Forget it, whatever you left
behind that's the past.

2419
02:00:27,109 --> 02:00:28,770
Come on!
- Shanti!

2420
02:00:30,245 --> 02:00:34,648
If I call Santosh my brother,
do you have any objection?

2421
02:00:34,716 --> 02:00:35,774
Brother!

2422
02:00:42,658 --> 02:00:43,852
Who is Santosh's wife?

2423
02:00:46,061 --> 02:00:49,258
I am asking, who is Santosh's wife?

2424
02:00:49,998 --> 02:00:51,727
I am Santosh's wife!

2425
02:00:55,070 --> 02:00:56,128
Tell me what is the matter?

2426
02:00:56,204 --> 02:00:59,071
The police have arrested
Mr. Santosh!

2427
02:01:21,229 --> 02:01:22,890
Hello!
- Sir, this is Shivani speaking.

2428
02:01:22,965 --> 02:01:24,694
The police have arrested Santosh!

2429
02:01:25,033 --> 02:01:26,295
Are you serious?
- Yes sir.

2430
02:01:27,169 --> 02:01:28,227
I am coming.

2431
02:01:30,872 --> 02:01:31,930
What happened, Prem?

2432
02:01:32,975 --> 02:01:36,433
Shivani had called, the police
have arrested Santosh!

2433
02:01:40,048 --> 02:01:41,106
I think we should go!

2434
02:01:44,786 --> 02:01:49,382
Tell me, how many wives you
have imagined yourself with.

2435
02:01:49,725 --> 02:01:50,783
Tell me in total.

2436
02:01:50,859 --> 02:01:53,327
If we ask his total, we
will forget our total.

2437
02:01:53,996 --> 02:01:55,054
I will write 50!

2438
02:01:55,263 --> 02:01:56,457
What are you saying sir?

2439
02:01:56,732 --> 02:01:58,791
I am just saying it,
but I will do it too.

2440
02:01:58,934 --> 02:02:00,731
Once you spend some days in the
jail you will come to your senses.

2441
02:02:00,802 --> 02:02:02,269
Lock him up!

2442
02:02:02,471 --> 02:02:04,132
Constable, lock him up!

2443
02:02:11,947 --> 02:02:13,005
And you are?

2444
02:02:14,349 --> 02:02:16,476
Shanti, his wife!

2445
02:02:17,753 --> 02:02:18,811
Real!

2446
02:02:20,822 --> 02:02:22,221
Santosh and Shanti!

2447
02:02:23,291 --> 02:02:26,089
Where there is Santosh,
there has to be Shanti!

2448
02:02:27,295 --> 02:02:30,753
Inspector sir, whatever he did
knowingly or unknowingly...

2449
02:02:30,832 --> 02:02:32,891
...maybe I am responsible for it too.

2450
02:02:34,102 --> 02:02:36,764
If I wouldn't have let him
leave from the house...

2451
02:02:36,838 --> 02:02:39,500
...he wouldn't be looking for
his Shanti in other women

2452
02:02:40,509 --> 02:02:41,908
Please release him!

2453
02:02:42,044 --> 02:02:44,376
Look, I have filed a case.

2454
02:02:44,913 --> 02:02:47,108
I cannot release him without a bail.

2455
02:02:47,249 --> 02:02:48,511
How can you do that?

2456
02:02:50,452 --> 02:02:52,181
What crime has he committed?

2457
02:02:52,921 --> 02:02:53,979
And you are?

2458
02:02:55,457 --> 02:02:56,515
You!

2459
02:02:56,792 --> 02:02:57,850
Khurana sir.

2460
02:02:57,926 --> 02:02:59,393
I am his neighbour.

2461
02:03:03,131 --> 02:03:05,929
Then you must know about
his ill-deeds.

2462
02:03:06,401 --> 02:03:08,801
Santosh is a very nice man,
please leave him.

2463
02:03:08,870 --> 02:03:11,065
He will have to release him!

2464
02:03:11,873 --> 02:03:13,397
We will take him along.

2465
02:03:13,542 --> 02:03:14,873
Right now.

2466
02:03:14,943 --> 02:03:18,071
Look, you are taking the
law in your hands.

2467
02:03:18,480 --> 02:03:19,811
What case have you filed against
him inspector Waghmare?

2468
02:03:19,881 --> 02:03:20,939
Sir, he has filed a case.

2469
02:03:21,083 --> 02:03:22,880
And says that he will have to
stay here for a few days.

2470
02:03:23,018 --> 02:03:24,485
He will have to do everything here.

2471
02:03:24,820 --> 02:03:29,883
Prem, in your party he imagined
your wife as his own.

2472
02:03:31,226 --> 02:03:33,490
Only I know how I saved my wife.

2473
02:03:33,829 --> 02:03:34,887
Let him go sir.

2474
02:03:35,964 --> 02:03:37,431
Imagination is not a crime.

2475
02:03:37,833 --> 02:03:40,893
I will arrest him under any case
and get him jailed for long.

2476
02:03:46,374 --> 02:03:49,901
Its okay sir, I have forgiven him.

2477
02:03:52,514 --> 02:03:54,573
Inspector sir, I have
committed a mistake.

2478
02:03:58,053 --> 02:03:59,384
Whatever has happened, has happened.

2479
02:03:59,921 --> 02:04:01,912
Please don't jail him inspector sir.

2480
02:04:03,325 --> 02:04:04,383
Heard that!

2481
02:04:05,193 --> 02:04:07,923
Get imprisoned in your married life!

2482
02:04:08,330 --> 02:04:11,993
For a husband and a wife,
that's the biggest bond.

2483
02:04:14,336 --> 02:04:15,530
You can go!

2484
02:04:25,413 --> 02:04:26,971
Thank you sir, you...

2485
02:04:27,149 --> 02:04:28,946
We will talk later at home.

2486
02:04:29,084 --> 02:04:30,346
Come, I will drop you home.

2487
02:04:30,418 --> 02:04:31,476
No sir.

2488
02:04:31,553 --> 02:04:35,887
Today we will leave only after
we understand each other.

2489
02:04:35,957 --> 02:04:37,481
You can go.

2490
02:04:37,559 --> 02:04:38,617
Please.

2491
02:04:39,361 --> 02:04:41,886
You explain each other
something too.

2492
02:04:42,297 --> 02:04:44,492
We will go home and understand
something too.

2493
02:04:45,433 --> 02:04:46,900
Come on Khurana!

2494
02:04:46,968 --> 02:04:48,094
Come on Mrs. Khurana!

2495
02:04:57,512 --> 02:04:59,912
We are going outside
the police station...

2496
02:04:59,981 --> 02:05:01,039
...and see you later.

2497
02:05:01,116 --> 02:05:02,174
Bye.

2498
02:05:02,250 --> 02:05:03,444
Mishra, come I will drop you!

2499
02:05:05,187 --> 02:05:06,313
Come, I will take you home.

2500
02:05:06,388 --> 02:05:07,446
No, no not with you.

2501
02:05:08,256 --> 02:05:09,314
Okay!

2502
02:05:12,327 --> 02:05:13,919
Mr. Mishra go, you leave too.

2503
02:05:13,995 --> 02:05:16,463
I want to talk to sister-in-law.

2504
02:05:16,932 --> 02:05:18,923
Will you say it in
the police station?

2505
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:20,058
Leave something for tomorrow.

2506
02:05:20,135 --> 02:05:21,261
Go.
- Yes!

2507
02:05:24,472 --> 02:05:25,530
Listen Shanti...

2508
02:05:25,607 --> 02:05:27,472
Take your wife and leave.

2509
02:05:27,542 --> 02:05:28,941
If sir gets in a bad mood again...

2510
02:05:29,010 --> 02:05:30,068
...then even I won't be
able to do anything.

2511
02:05:30,145 --> 02:05:31,544
Go from here!

2512
02:05:46,361 --> 02:05:47,487
Mr. Mishra, you still not left!

2513
02:05:47,963 --> 02:05:51,160
I thought... I wanted to
talk to sister-in-law!

2514
02:05:51,566 --> 02:05:52,624
What?

2515
02:05:52,968 --> 02:05:55,960
I wanted to say sister-in-law,
Singh sir is a very nice man...

2516
02:05:56,037 --> 02:05:58,028
...you know him more.

2517
02:05:58,106 --> 02:06:00,040
We had only gone to the dance
bar to rape. - What?

2518
02:06:00,976 --> 02:06:02,967
Rape. That we do with the music!

2519
02:06:04,379 --> 02:06:05,971
Mr. Mishra, that's rap.

2520
02:06:06,047 --> 02:06:07,309
That's one thing.

2521
02:06:07,382 --> 02:06:08,713
How can that be one
thing Mr. Mishra?

2522
02:06:09,050 --> 02:06:11,041
How can rape and rap be one thing?

2523
02:06:11,319 --> 02:06:13,514
How can rape and rap be
one thing, Mr. Mishra?

2524
02:06:13,588 --> 02:06:14,646
No, no please don't be hungry...

2525
02:06:14,723 --> 02:06:16,714
No, no, I am not hungry at all.

2526
02:06:16,992 --> 02:06:18,516
And this constipation
is very Important.

2527
02:06:18,593 --> 02:06:21,187
And today you will
have to do toilet.

2528
02:06:21,263 --> 02:06:22,992
These things are not non-sex at all.

2529
02:06:23,064 --> 02:06:25,726
And don't consider your bloody
fool life a condom.

2530
02:06:26,001 --> 02:06:27,059
Sir...
- Quiet!

2531
02:06:29,004 --> 02:06:30,528
Mr. Mishra, toilet-tolerate.

2532
02:06:31,006 --> 02:06:32,064
Condom-condem!

2533
02:06:32,140 --> 02:06:33,198
Rap-rape!

2534
02:06:33,275 --> 02:06:34,606
Constipation-conversation!

2535
02:06:35,010 --> 02:06:38,002
You know the meaning very well.

2536
02:06:39,014 --> 02:06:41,005
Just because people laugh
on your wrong English!

2537
02:06:41,082 --> 02:06:42,140
That's why you use new words...

2538
02:06:42,217 --> 02:06:44,412
...so that people laugh a lot.

2539
02:06:45,020 --> 02:06:47,545
And you try to pose
as a very simple man!

2540
02:06:48,023 --> 02:06:49,081
We will meet in the office tomorrow!

2541
02:06:49,157 --> 02:06:50,215
Go!

2542
02:06:54,029 --> 02:06:55,087
Singh sir!

2543
02:06:59,034 --> 02:07:03,630
I always thought that I am the best
but... - This is an act too.

2544
02:07:04,239 --> 02:07:06,036
Being an elderly person you
are touching my feet...

2545
02:07:06,107 --> 02:07:08,041
...isn't that an act too.

2546
02:07:12,047 --> 02:07:13,639
Fine, when everything
is an act, then bye.

2547
02:07:13,715 --> 02:07:14,773
I don't understand anything.

2548
02:07:15,383 --> 02:07:16,782
Do you have money for auto?

2549
02:07:18,053 --> 02:07:19,452
Go! Go, we will meet in the office.

2550
02:07:22,057 --> 02:07:23,115
Bye!

2551
02:07:23,191 --> 02:07:25,125
Why did you scold Mr. Mishra?

2552
02:07:25,193 --> 02:07:27,593
If I wouldn't have, then
he wouldn't leave.

2553
02:07:28,063 --> 02:07:30,122
And I want to talk to you!

2554
02:07:30,198 --> 02:07:31,597
Is there anything left to say?

2555
02:07:32,667 --> 02:07:35,602
Shanti, I can't think of a
way to apologise to you.

2556
02:07:35,670 --> 02:07:38,264
Should I join my hands
or bow in front of you?

2557
02:07:39,207 --> 02:07:40,799
Why will you apologise?

2558
02:07:41,409 --> 02:07:42,603
It was my fault too.

2559
02:07:43,611 --> 02:07:46,079
And anyway, there is no place
for thank you and sorry...

2560
02:07:46,147 --> 02:07:47,671
...in the husband wife relationship.

2561
02:07:51,486 --> 02:07:55,217
From today, your every wish
will be my necessity.

2562
02:07:57,492 --> 02:08:00,290
And your every necessity
will be my life.

2563
02:08:18,246 --> 02:08:20,180
Rama Rama what is this drama!

2564
02:08:20,248 --> 02:08:22,182
Rama Rama what is this drama!

2565
02:08:22,250 --> 02:08:24,650

02:08:29,591 --> 02:08:31,718
Rama Rama what is this drama!

2568
02:08:32,127 --> 02:08:34,254
Rama Rama what is this drama!

2569
02:08:34,329 --> 02:08:36,524
This drama! This drama!

2570
02:08:56,484 --> 02:08:58,349
Munna's photo on the notes.

2571
02:08:58,420 --> 02:09:00,888
Red light on the auto rickshaw.

2572
02:09:01,156 --> 02:09:03,147
There is a tax on fat people.

2573
02:09:04,159 --> 02:09:05,217
Give me a break baby!

2574
02:09:06,161 --> 02:09:08,220
You can now clap with one hand.

2575
02:09:08,296 --> 02:09:10,230
Now my sister-in-law is my wife

2576
02:09:10,298 --> 02:09:12,357
Diwali now comes in January!

2577
02:09:15,170 --> 02:09:17,229
The rooster now lays eggs!

2578
02:09:17,305 --> 02:09:19,364
The cat drinks cold drink.

2579
02:09:19,441 --> 02:09:21,705
The criminal thrashes the police!

2580
02:09:23,178 --> 02:09:25,373
Rama Rama what is this drama!

2581
02:09:25,580 --> 02:09:27,775
Rama Rama what is this drama!

2582
02:09:28,183 --> 02:09:30,242
Rama Rama what is this drama!

2583
02:09:30,318 --> 02:09:32,377
This drama! This drama!

2584
02:09:32,454 --> 02:09:34,786
Rama Rama what is this drama!

2585
02:09:35,190 --> 02:09:37,249

02:09:37,325 --> 02:09:39,384
Rama Rama what is this drama!

2587
02:09:39,461 --> 02:09:41,395
This drama! This drama!

2588
02:10:02,617 --> 02:10:03,743
Michael Jackson dances in bhangda.

2589
02:10:03,818 --> 02:10:06,218
One wife, but ten brother-in-laws.

2590
02:10:06,287 --> 02:10:08,278
Thieves are the protectors
of the house.

2591
02:10:09,357 --> 02:10:10,415
Take it up!

2592
02:10:10,758 --> 02:10:12,953

2593
02:10:13,228 --> 02:10:15,423
There is a Bindi on
Britney's forehead.

02:10:18,233 --> 02:10:19,291
There is dance, but no drums.

2596
02:10:19,367 --> 02:10:20,425
The world is no more round

2597
02:10:20,502 --> 02:10:21,560
There is no corruption
in politics.

2598
02:10:21,636 --> 02:10:22,694
Rama Rama what is this drama!

2599
