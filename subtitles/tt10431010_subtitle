[STUDENTS RECITING TAMIZH RHYMES]

2
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,270
[Students] Hey, 
the lorry has arrived.

3
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,640
Come on, keep reversing

4
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:55,350
there, stop right there!

5
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:57,520
Come on, 
put that bench out here.

6
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,390
Ey-- climb up in twos

7
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:00,640
climb up carefully

8
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:03,060
Ey-- hope everyone is 
carrying your casual clothes?

9
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:05,430
Ah-- students in uniform 
change into casuals.

10
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:08,140
-Be careful, kid 
-Brother, how's AHM doing?

11
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,850
He's doing good, 
when is the next gathering?

12
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:12,600
Very soon, it'll be great 
if the head count increases.

13
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,390
Firstly, 
you hike the price 50 per head.

14
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:15,770
It's their parents demand.

15
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:17,470
Ah-- fine will pay up soon.

16
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,770
AHM asked to mention it.

17
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:20,140
You guys are charging 200/head--

18
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,430
--why don't you use that? 
-Then, what about us?

19
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,310
As if you're going to pay up.

20
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,220
One, two, three, four, five...

21
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:27,600
...six, nine, ten 
-Hello, hello...

22
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,470
Where are you taking the 
students during the school hours?

23
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,350
-He's the new Teacher 
-Oh is it?

24
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,470
Can't you hear what I am saying? 
Let them go.

25
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:35,600
Ey-- how dare you?

26
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,600
-Hurry up lazy heads, load them up sooner. 
-Oh God, what happened?

27
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,770
-That's our Maths Teacher

28
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:40,180
-Come on, climb up 
-Look, there's space...

29
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:42,100
-Load them up 
-You're forgetting this is a school

30
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:42,850
Get lost, damn it

31
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,310
Come on climb up. 
Load them all carefully...

32
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,810
Hey, bolt the door.

33
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,350
That's fine, you've been asking 
too many questions though

34
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:57,140
are you new to this town?

35
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,810
Are you going to get an 
admission at that school?

36
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:09,180
Obviously they'll 
be shocked to hear

37
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,560
it's not a school, 
but a buzzing market.

38
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,180
Garbage lying all over

39
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,640
commotion, 
will be like a herd of goats.

40
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:20,270
You will see students gathered in 
groups fighting in the name of caste.

41
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:23,930
Teachers are hopeless, 
with no sense of time or discipline.

42
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,220
Govt. Schools, 
are bound to be worse

43
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,970
but this school, 
tops the list in being the worst.

44
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:32,020
Schools are meant 
to teach good things

45
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:33,770
but if you study at this school

46
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:36,770
you'll end up attaining 
all sorts of bad habits.

47
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:38,350
The town is called "Puthur"

48
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:40,810
but the teachers are 
still stuck in Stone Age.

49
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:46,100
Look-- the safe haven you 
were looking for is here.

[Vendor] Sour berries for 1 
buck, and candies for 50 cents.

51

In spite of warning, 
you're getting an admission here

52
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,520
carry on

53
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:00,930
It's better to give an advice 
or experience, only if asked.

54
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:06,520
Add this cigarette on my tab.

55
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,220

enough to grasp, if taught.‏

She's gone a little overboard 
with the lipstick today.

57
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,020
Ey-- play without 
making a noise.

58
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,470

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,890
took an oath as Chief 
Commander of India.

62
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,770
Fine, shall we remember the name? 
"Reigner"

63
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,180
"Foreigner... Wallis"

64
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:10,390
Keep water mug as a reference.

everything from our country.

00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:14,560
Yes, Teacher

67
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:16,890
Very Good. 
Now tell me what is the name?

68
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:18,520
Karren Wallis Prabhu!

69
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,180
Ok, next we'll try 
to remember the year.

70
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,600
How's your business 
coming along?

71
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,140
The business is running good.

72
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,600
I Just came to 
sign the register.

73
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,060
-There's no one at the shop, I'll leave. 
-Fine, you leave

Excuse me!

76
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:46,890
Don't you conduct 
morning prayers?

77
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,970
What do you guys want?

78
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,020
I'm here for admission

79
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:54,140
wait for a while, once AHM is 
here, meet him and get a receipt.

80
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,970
Only then, 
I'll issue an application.

81
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,720
Seems like there's no 
Head Master out here.

82
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:02,930
There's no Head Master over here

83
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:04,770
don't be annoying, 
wait over there.

84
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:06,470
If AHM arrives, 
he'll yell at me.

85
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:08,470
-Come on... 
-Mmmm

86
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,390
I can't even do a 
Rangoli in the morning.

87
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:12,020
Excuse me!

88
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,220
Welcome, Sir.

-don't forget 
-I'll go right away, Sir.

91
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,220
Meena!

00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:45,470
-Bloody womanizer 
-Give me a smile...

93
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:48,270
Don't you have any sense? 
you're blocking the way

94
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:49,310
move aside.

95
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,810

-Good Morning, Sir. 
-Mmmm-hmmm

97
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,600
Listen, this is AHM. 
Come in and speak to him.

98
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:03,770
-What do you want? 
-Admission for this kid.

99
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,770
It's been a month, 
since the school began

100
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:07,180
and you're here now?

101
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,770
-Which grade? 
-6th grade.

102
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:21,220
Why do I have to 
pay 2500 rupees?

103
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:23,350
Isn't the Govt. fees 230 rupees?

104
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:27,560
If you seek Private Schools, 
you'll end up spending a bomb.

105
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:30,390
Moreover they'll demand 
more for being a month late.

106
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,930
If you're willing, 
then pay what's mentioned on that

107
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,640
if not get out from here.

108
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,350
You're not even 
1% fit to be here

109
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:39,140
wonder how you became a Teacher.

110
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,680
Ey-- Ey, how dare you?

111
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,430
Don't mess around with me.

112
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:44,430
You're getting angry, 
'cause I insulted you

113
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,310
just the same, 
we're angry when you speak.

114
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:49,640
Oh-- so you too will get angry?

115
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:53,140
If you're angry, 
take your kid to another school.

116
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:56,140
This kid won't get an admission, 
even if anyone recommends her.

117
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,600
Take your kid and 
get out from here.

118
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,770
You're going overboard, damn it.

119
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,020
Ey-- Ey! Vasugi!

120
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,390
-Stop that woman 
-What is she doing?

121
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,060
-Stop that woman. 
-Ma'am stop, don't do it.

122
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:19,180
-Stop right there, damn woman. 
-Please listen, stop it

123
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,430
Don't you have any sense?

124
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:21,520
-Give me that rod... 
-What you've been doing?

125
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,930
She's so bloody stubborn.

126
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,180
Can't you hear? 
Have you gone mad?

127
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:26,680
What are you reading?

128
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:28,020
Put that paper 
down and stop her.

129
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,640
She's the Head Master!

130
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,100
AHM got rattled, 
'cause she rang the bell.

131
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,720
They'll ask us to disperse 
once the prayers are done.

132
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:50,640
I am Geetha Rani!

133
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:53,930
From this moment, 
I'm the Head Master of this school.

134
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:57,970
Everyone should be inside 
the school before 9am.

135
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:01,770
At 9:05am the school 
gate will be locked.

136
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,930
No one should jump 
over the walls.

137
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,310
No one should step inside the 
school without the uniform.

138
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,350
Oh God no!

139
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:09,890
In spite of hearing 
the bell ring

140
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:12,770
12 teachers who didn't enter the 
class, issue an memo to them, Vasugi.

141
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:13,560
Ok, madam.

142
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:17,390
If anyone gets 3 memos, 
generate suspension

143
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:22,350
6 teachers, who have signed the 
ledger but not inside the school

144
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:24,680
file a Police 
complaint against them.

145
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,060
I'll recommend suspension.

146
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:29,720
-Once in, hand it over to them 
-Seems like, we gotta work

147
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,770
-PET...! 
-Huh?

148
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,270
School should remain as a school

149
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:37,680
and teachers should 
be there for students.

150
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,100
Prayer, disperse!

151
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:45,350
Madam!

152
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:49,560
Shall I assemble all the 
teachers for introduction?

153
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,060
-How long will it take? 
-It will take an hour, madam

154
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,930
Meanwhile, 
who will be teaching at the class?

155
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:57,020
I'll get to know the names and 
details, when required

156
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,720
-ask them to head to their classes 
-Mmmm

157
00:10:58,850 --> 00:10:59,850
Ok, Madam.

158
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:06,850
-Vasugi! 
-Madam...

159
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,350
Why isn't he at a class?

160
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:10,390
Madam, we didn't prepare 
a schedule for him.

161
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,600
Prepare a schedule and hand 
it over by the end of the day.

162
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,220
Now ask him to 
substitute for a class.

163
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:17,720
He can come over, 
when I'm not around.

164
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:18,970
Ok, madam!

165
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,640
Good Morning, Madam.

166
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,140
Why is this here?

167
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:45,100
So that no one gets in 
without your permission.

168
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,350
To discriminate ones' entry--

169
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:51,140
--it's not the crux of a Temple.

170
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:53,850
-Remove it! 
-Ok, madam.

171
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:57,770
The room is in a great mess.

172
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:59,220
I'm doomed!

173
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,270
I'll clean it up, 
I will get men and get it cleaned.

174
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:06,850
I've made her admission, 
please sign here.

175
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:16,020
-Make sure she comes to the school 
-Ok, madam.

176
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,020
Study well.

177
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:18,470
Go ahead!

178
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:21,350
Sorry Madam, I wasn't aware 
you were the Head Master.

179
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:27,350
Heavy rainfall in Andhra, 
from Cuddapah district.

180
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,430
But our town is 
parched with no rain.

181
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,560
Ey-- AHM is here.

182
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:45,100
Sir, please come in.

183
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,930
He must be tired after the class.

184
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:49,020
He comes to the staff 
room, once in 6 months.

185
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,720
Move aside, let him sit down.

186
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:53,180
Sir, please sit down. 
I've cleaned the bench for you.

187
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,680
Don't be scared, it won't break.

188
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,640
Sit down, he won't ask you to.

189
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,430
Ey!

190
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:12,720
Wonder where she came from...

191
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:16,930
...just a day, 
and it feels like we faced a hailstorm.

192
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:21,220
I was having a candy.

193
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:24,220
-Do you want? 
-Ey...

194
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,970
-What 'bout you? 
-Don't piss me off

195
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,180
Even if you're, I don't care.

196
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,310
Bloody dufus!

197
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,810
He's nodding like a Penguin.

198
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:37,310
-Look, isn't this good? 
-It won't work out

199
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:38,930
-Get inside 
-HM, is here...

200
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:41,060
-Get lost... 
-Buddy hide your cigarette

201
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,020
It's the HM, get inside boys.

202
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:48,770
I'm studying at a Govt. 
School, 'cause it's not strict

203
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,890
-do you know, who is my father? 
-Hey!

204
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:57,600
He has to bring his 
father to school tomorrow.

205
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,930
-Ok, Madam. 
-Got the cigarette, scoot from here.

206
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:03,350
Welcome, Miss. New Head Master.

207
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:07,270
You should sell, cigarettes, 
betel etc 500m off the school

208
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,970
I shouldn't see 
sell them anymore.

209
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:12,020
You can put a leash 
on your students

210
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,430
don't teach us how 
to run a business.

211
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,930
Ey-- Ey! Ey-- Ey!

212
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,890
Look here, 
you're messing with the wrong person

213
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:22,640
Hey!

214
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,060
Hey, come on keep running

215
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,600

Hey!

218
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,180
What is it?

219
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:48,810
The new teacher held the 
shopkeeper's hand twisted it

220
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:50,770
then she gave a strong 
blow with another hand.

221
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:53,720
Then she whisked 
a strong kick---

222
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:55,470
---he fell far from here.

223
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:59,100
-Did you see it? 
-Yes, I did see.

224
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:27,310
-She's poisonous... 
-She was there too

225
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,930

226
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,180
-Good afternoon, teacher 
-Please come in, ma'am

Good afternoon, teacher

228
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:33,100
Hey, move aside.

229
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:36,020

00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,930
It was from me, teacher.

236
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,520
Tell your mom, it is delicious.

237
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,810
Ok, teacher.

238
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,470

-I am Geetha Rani 
-Ok, teacher.

245
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,810
Just call me, Geetha.

246
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:21,560
that's how you call a 
friend, right?

247
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,310
but make sure, 
don't get too comfortable with it.

248
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:30,140

Hey, be careful!

253
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,430
Why do you have run so fast?

254
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:50,180
Eh-- can't you be careful?

00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:01,520
Why were you running from me?

You were here to drink 
water, right?

258
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,770
You should fear, 
only if you've done something wrong.

00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,810

-Kathir.

263
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,520
-Kathir, is it? 
-Mmmm.

264
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,390
Go!

267
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:16,060
You asked for coffee 
and disappeared.

268
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,770
I went to the neighbors to get 
cable and newspaper contact.

269
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:21,060
Fine, how was the school?

270
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:23,770
It's good though.

271
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:25,430
But I heard something else

272
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,600
I was told the town 
is a hot bed for crime

273
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:30,060
at least one murder gets 
registered in a month.

274
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:33,180
This town keeps the 
Police quite busy.

275
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:35,350
If Teachers put in extra effort

276
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,220
the burden on Police 
will come down.

277
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:39,890

278
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:41,470

[OUR SCHOOL]

281
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,970
Did you get your kid 
admitted into the school?

282
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,850
Why are you headed once 
again to the school?

283
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,390
I've started a new 
job over there.

284
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,890
Really? That too at 
that atrocious school?

285
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,930
What job is it? 
Oh, you must've joined the Treasury

286
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:08,180
Thank goodness, 
I thought you joined the herd of donkeys.

287
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:12,310
One main reason, this nation is 
backward, is 'cause of the teachers.

288
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:16,270
They never nurtured a generation 
stating, bribery and scams are wrong.

289
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:18,520
Do you think Teachers 
take up the job to serve?

290
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:22,100
If the Govt. announces, 
their salary will be reduced to half

291
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:25,520
half the Teachers training colleges 
in Tamilnadu will be shut down.

292
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:30,560

00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:03,470
you can write down your demands 
and put it inside that box.

345
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:05,310
This is called, "Sunday Box".

346
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,140
We can celebrate this together.

347
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:10,020
Everyday, one teacher will be 
responsible for the school.

348
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:13,430
All the events on that day, 
will have a governance.

349
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,720
If something goes wrong, 
responsibility should be taken.

350
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:20,060
On that day, they'll be the 
acting Head Master for the school.

351
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:22,520
Let's all say it together...

352
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:24,520
"Let's learn with utmost Joy"

353
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,520
"Let's learn with utmost Joy"

354
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,810
"Let's learn together"

355
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:29,220
"Let's learn together"

356
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,100
"Learn with courage"

357
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,350
"Learn with courage"

358
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,720
"Let's learn the world"

359
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:34,220
"Let's learn the world"

360
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,470
"Let's learn with utmost Joy"

361
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,640
"Let's learn with utmost Joy"

362
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,100
"Let's learn together"

363
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,430
"Let's learn together"

364
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,600
"Learn with courage"

365
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,970
"Learn with courage"

366
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,100
"Let's learn the world"

367
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,600
"Let's learn the world"

368
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:51,220
Mmm- start the car.

369
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:10,140
Vanakkam, Sir.

370
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:16,350
Boss, 
our new school at Velumpatti

371
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,470
he's the Teacher at the Govt. 
school over there.

372
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,350
He got 12 bright students 
to join our school

373
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:23,270
he's here to collect 
his commission for that.

374
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:25,020
Good job!

375
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:29,430
If he gets 20 or more students, 
give him 10-15% commission.

376
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:30,810
Ok, Boss!

377
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:34,520
-Wait here. 
-Sure!

378
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,720
Good morning, Sir.

379
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:37,060
-Good Morning! 
-Sir, a minute please

380
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,270
-What's it? -Quarry details 
are here -Good Morning, Sir.

381
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,100
Boss, quarry order file is here.

382
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:57,640
Listen-- a new voice was 
heard at the school in town.

383
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:02,850
I did hear-- inquire about it.

384
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,060
Ok, Boss!

385
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,890
-Ey! 
-Boss...

386
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:09,520
don't send anyone, 
you personally inquire about it.

387
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,520
Ok, boss.

388
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,640
Who was it?

389
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:33,520
Look, that lady over there.

390
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,560
An outsider with such arrogance.

391
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,180
Stop right there, 
are you the new Head Master?

392
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,770
I heard that you won't let my son 
inside the school, if I don't meet you

393
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:42,220
Our party will reign next

394
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:43,890
I'm the MLA of 
this constituency.

395
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:47,020
That's the only reason, 
my son is studying in this Govt. School.

396
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:48,560
He's living his life 
with full freedom

397
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,890
I don't bother him at all.

398
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,310
Who are you to question him?

399
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,390
Freedom is something, 
you shouldn't take it for granted.

400
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,180
You should do the right thing.

401
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:58,930
What!? I didn't understand?

402
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:00,310
Then he's not incapable

403
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,600
You're incapable 
of being a father.

404
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,470
I'll take care of him.

405
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:06,810
You can get out from here.

406
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:08,890
Ey-- you don't know who 
you're messing with?

407
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:09,890
This is my town.

408
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:11,220
This is my, School!

409
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,680
I'll get you sacked 
from this school.

410
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:17,390
Ey-- you don't have to study 
at this school anymore.

411
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:20,140
Zero!

412
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:22,720
I meant you.

413
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:29,560
What are you staring at?

414
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,640
That's right, you're a Zero!

415
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,560
Have you achieved anything 
other than your father's wealth?

416
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,810
Have you topped the class?

417
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:41,060
or have you won a 
prize in some sport?

418
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:45,470
You're a hero, only if you achieve 
more than your father offers.

419
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,220
If not, a Zero!

420
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:51,020
Win, if you got the courage.

421
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,430
I'll present my cheeks to you

422
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:54,180
you can give me a slap.

423
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:56,720
If you think you'll lose

424
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:58,640
get out from here, right away.

425
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:04,770
Ey!...Ey!

426
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:17,520
A woman in this town has 
become popular in just a day

427
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,020
what did you say?

428
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:20,720
That school has got a 
new woman Head Master

429
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:22,720
-Oh-Oh! 
-She's arrogant it seems.

430
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:25,140
She dictates her own rules.

431
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:28,350
MLA from the opposition 
party of this town

432
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:30,060
his son studies at that school.

433
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,930
He went on to 
speak for his son--

434
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:35,270
--and got insulted 
by the Head Master.

435
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:38,810
That woman Head Master, 
is new to her job--

436
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,470
--just wait and watch, 
she'll succumb to scams too.

437
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,310
Highly Possible!

438
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,810
[PARENTS]

439
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:14,930
Just 'cause a new HM has arrived

440
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:17,930
they'll call for a meeting 
and yell at the kids.

441
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,310
On top of it, an 
useless gathering.

442
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,100
Ey-- look at her blouse

443
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,430
looks like a Police women.

444
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:24,850
-Good Morning, Madam. 
Everyone is here -Ok.

445
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:28,520
For God sake, 
please be seated calm.

446
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:30,060
We can only go in the evening--

447
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,850
--this women, 
called everyone for a gathering.

448
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:34,100
There's no one to help at the 
shop, gotta find someone

449
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,310
Greetings to one and all.

450
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:40,560
-I'm the new new Head Master. 
-Yesu said will take care of it

451
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:42,520
Why don't come too, 
we'll catch a movie.

452
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,060
Come on, let's catch a movie.

453
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:47,890
Ey-- Ey, hang up, 
I'll call you back soon.

454
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:55,770
I'm sure many will have a personal 
attachment with this school.

455
00:27:55,930 --> 00:27:57,180
You might have 
studied over here.

456
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:01,140
Can someone, 
tell me if there's a difference--

457
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,930
--from the time you 
were a student out here?

458
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:10,270
Nothing has changed, madam. 
Everything is the same.

459
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:11,810
Who do you hold 
responsible for this?

460
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:14,640
Neither MLA nor an MP has 
done any good till now.

461
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:16,310
What else?

462
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:20,310
Officers working here don't report 
the mishaps to the higher officials.

463
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,520
What else?

464
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:25,640
Neither the system nor the Govt. 
is doing anything about it.

465
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,520
What have you done?

466
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:31,390
What have you done for 
the school you studied in?

467
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:35,180
Temples in every town 
are vibrant and colorful.

468
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:38,140
Govt. didn't come forward 
with funds to develop them.

469
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,810
It's the public, who did it.

470
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,350
Temples and schools 
are not the same.

471
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,850
In fact, a step above.

472
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,180
God comes after the Teacher.

473
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,220
People are generous with donations 
during the Temple festivities.

474
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,720
Why don't you feel the same, 
when it comes to the schools.

475
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:57,890
If you people come forward, 
not only the crux of temples,

476
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:00,060
even the school toilets 
will be spick and span.

477
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:02,600
It should come from your heart.

478
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:05,560
Many wage workers children 
study at this school

479
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:07,020
I'm asking them too

480
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:09,720
even if you have to carry 
a huge sign for help

481
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:12,430
either at your work place 
or someone for that matter

482
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:15,970
you guys point me towards 
them, I'll ask them myself.

483
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:19,140
But that has to 
benefit our children.

484
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:39,930
Hello, tell me.

485
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:41,220
I'm Head Master 
speaking form R Puthur.

486
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,390
Tell me, madam.

487
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:45,140
Accounts state, since 4 years you've 
used fund for the welfare of the school.

488
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:46,600
But nothing has been done.

489
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:48,520
Your people should 
arrive tomorrow over here

490
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,470
and the work should begin.

491
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:53,970
If not, the entire school 
will be at the PWD office.

492
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:54,890

01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:22,930
If you don't do your job, 
in spite of getting paid

1198
01:11:23,350 --> 01:11:25,350
I believe that should be 
added to the list of scams.

1199
01:11:25,850 --> 01:11:26,970
I'm very sure of it.

1200
01:11:28,220 --> 01:11:31,470
Children of 38 teachers of our 
school are studying in schools.

1201
01:11:31,850 --> 01:11:35,890
Raise your hands, how many have 
their children study at govt. School?

1202
01:11:42,140 --> 01:11:44,430
When you don't 
believe in yourself

1203
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:46,020
how do you expect 
me to trust you?

1204
01:11:48,020 --> 01:11:49,640
Just those 5, you guys tell me

1205
01:11:50,390 --> 01:11:53,100
should I step inside or not?

1206
01:12:15,970 --> 01:12:17,680
She faces anything 
with true grit.

1207
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:21,220
When questioned, 
reverts with force.

1208
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:23,890
Now, she's known 
to the entire town.

1209
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:25,890
If we try to hurt her

1210
01:12:26,020 --> 01:12:27,390
our image will be tarnished.

1211
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:29,220
Our next move 
should be a big one

1212
01:12:29,470 --> 01:12:34,270
Ey-- you were very enthused, 
but now you've done squat about it.

1213
01:12:35,270 --> 01:12:38,270
I can hear your 
bloody mind voice.

1214
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:41,600
That teacher, 
teaching me a lesson too

1215
01:12:41,770 --> 01:12:43,140
our next blow to her

1216
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:45,640
she should remember 
us for her lifetime.

1217
01:12:45,890 --> 01:12:50,270
But we need to know about 
her background thoroughly.

1218
01:12:50,390 --> 01:12:51,640
I'm aware now...

1219
01:12:52,310 --> 01:12:54,720
Madam knows that you 
were behind everything

1220
01:12:54,930 --> 01:12:58,100
AHM who went against, 
is relentlessly frequenting the court.

1221
01:12:58,350 --> 01:12:59,470
You've completed the job

1222
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:00,930
I'm pretty sure, your job is...

1223
01:13:02,430 --> 01:13:04,890
"Parade, turn right!"

1224
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:08,470
One, two, three, four...One!

1225
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:10,720
"Parade, march forward!"

1226
01:13:10,770 --> 01:13:12,350
"Turn left"

1227
01:13:13,060 --> 01:13:15,600
one, two, three, four...One!

1228
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:17,270
"Parade, caution!"

1229
01:13:17,310 --> 01:13:18,220
One!

1230
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:23,640
"Parade, caution!"

1231
01:13:23,770 --> 01:13:24,520
One!

1232
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:26,520
"Parade, march left"

1233
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:28,270
"turn left"

1234
01:13:29,060 --> 01:13:31,680
one, two, three, four...One!

1235
01:13:31,770 --> 01:13:33,560
"Parade, march forward"

1236
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:35,060
"march briskly"

1237
01:13:35,270 --> 01:13:36,720
"One, two, one"

1238
01:13:36,890 --> 01:13:38,180
"One, two, one"

1239
01:13:38,270 --> 01:13:39,810
"parade, halt!"

1240
01:13:39,850 --> 01:13:41,810
"Coming to halt... one, two"

1241
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:46,470
Ey--Ranganathan look over there.

1242
01:13:47,140 --> 01:13:48,970
Ah-- what's happening?

1243
01:13:51,350 --> 01:13:53,220
"Line cut!"

1244
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:00,520
-Ma'am, how are you? 
-I'm very good.

1245
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:02,600
-How's everything? 
-All fine.

1246
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:04,060
And is everything good?

1247
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:05,850
-Everything is fine... 
-Ok, ma'am I'll leave.

1248
01:14:06,220 --> 01:14:08,560
If we get hold of him, 
we'll know everything.

1249
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:09,810
Go and get him.

1250
01:14:10,180 --> 01:14:11,310
Singh ji!

1251
01:14:11,470 --> 01:14:14,140
Singh, Singh, sing...Even his 
walk is like he's running.

1252
01:14:14,390 --> 01:14:16,220
Do you know her?

1253
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:18,020
What were you guys 
speaking about?

1254
01:14:18,060 --> 01:14:19,770
Where did she come from?

1255
01:14:19,890 --> 01:14:21,430
I can't understand, Tamizh.

1256
01:14:23,180 --> 01:14:25,060
And I can't understand, Hindi.

1257
01:14:25,220 --> 01:14:26,810
Ey-- get someone 
who knows Hindi.

1258
01:14:26,850 --> 01:14:28,720
-How can I find someone here? 
-Go, damn it.

1259
01:14:28,850 --> 01:14:30,930
Hindi, where are you?

1260
01:14:31,350 --> 01:14:34,100
[Sings in joy]

1261
01:14:34,270 --> 01:14:35,390
Sir, this is not Hindi

1262
01:14:35,430 --> 01:14:36,680
Let that go, come on.

1263
01:14:37,810 --> 01:14:39,220
You brought a small kid

1264
01:14:39,270 --> 01:14:41,100
sir, he's the son 
of pani puri vendor

1265
01:14:41,180 --> 01:14:42,270
he speaks good Hindi.

1266
01:14:42,390 --> 01:14:44,560
Look at him, 
he's round like a puri.

1267
01:14:44,770 --> 01:14:46,560
-Namaste, sir ji. 
-Namaste.

1268
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:48,890
-Did you see that? 
-I know Hindi, sir.

1269
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:50,430
Ask him, what I had asked you

1270
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:53,930
they wanted to know, 
what was Madam's previous profession?

1271
01:14:54,100 --> 01:14:56,770
Madam is great and very strong.

1272
01:14:56,890 --> 01:14:59,350
She's a Lt.Colonel 
in Indian army.

1273
01:15:00,390 --> 01:15:03,470
HM, used to be a High-Rank 
military officer.

1274
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:05,430
-Military is it? 
-Yes.

Attack

1290

Self defense

1291
01:16:21,310 --> 01:16:22,350
Failure

1292
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:24,390
these three are 
under our control.

1293
01:16:24,720 --> 01:16:26,890
We move forward by attacking

1294
01:16:27,180 --> 01:16:29,100
our strength builds

1295
01:16:29,350 --> 01:16:31,350

I'm eligible for it now.

1304
01:16:53,430 --> 01:16:55,180
Stop that eligibility nonsense.

1305
01:16:55,850 --> 01:16:59,560
With your capacity, you can rise 
to higher rank and end your career.

1306
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:01,270
I'm proud of being in military.

1307
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:04,060
But now I definitely have to go.

1308
01:17:04,810 --> 01:17:08,060
According to your category under Civil 
range, Thasildar, Deputy Collector

1309
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:09,850
you can be either of it.

1310
01:17:10,020 --> 01:17:13,640
But you're stubborn on 
being a head master.

1311
01:17:13,770 --> 01:17:14,430
Why?

1312
01:17:14,850 --> 01:17:19,020
Oh, did you get a promotion 
from military school?

1313
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:26,350
Fine, instead of choosing a big 
cities like Coimbatore and Madurai

1314
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:29,970
but you've chosen an 
unknown town down south.

1315
01:17:30,060 --> 01:17:31,720
-That's where I should be, sir. 
-Eh?

1316
01:17:33,180 --> 01:17:34,060
Ok...

1317
01:17:34,430 --> 01:17:37,020
...sounds like you have 
a plan in your mind.

1318
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:38,720
All the best!

1319
01:17:39,470 --> 01:17:40,270
Take care.

1320
01:17:41,680 --> 01:17:43,060
Sir, 
when am I getting my due paid?

1321
01:17:43,100 --> 01:17:45,100
I had a doubt, when she 
instigated the state government.

1322
01:17:45,140 --> 01:17:46,890
That she must be from 
the central government.

1323
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:48,430
You're doomed.

1324
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:51,060
You've shown your 
antics to an elephant.

1325
01:17:51,470 --> 01:17:53,640
-Military!? 
-Hmmm.

1326
01:17:58,310 --> 01:18:00,640
A person who travels 
empty hand in the dark

1327
01:18:01,270 --> 01:18:03,060
than the person who 
travel with a flame torch

1328
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:05,850
the latter will have more grit

1329
01:18:06,350 --> 01:18:07,850
my grandmother 
used to mention it.

1330
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:09,720
Must be true.

1331
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:12,520
In fact, it's true.

1332
01:18:15,470 --> 01:18:18,350
Never knew she 
was that dictator.

1333
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:21,850
Socrates-- silent, silent...

1334
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:24,770
Brother, 
you seem very silent today.

1335
01:18:25,060 --> 01:18:26,890
No, no, nothing like 
that, madam.

1336
01:18:26,970 --> 01:18:28,890
You said the right 
thing, the other day.

1337
01:18:29,020 --> 01:18:30,930
You can't blame the 
teachers all together.

1338
01:18:31,060 --> 01:18:32,470
The system is not right.

1339
01:18:32,850 --> 01:18:34,640
There's a kid next to our house

1340
01:18:34,930 --> 01:18:36,140
he scored centum in maths

1341
01:18:36,390 --> 01:18:38,850
but scored 64% in biology 
and failed in 12th grade.

1342
01:18:39,020 --> 01:18:40,850
Do you think he'll be able to pursue, 
BSc.Mathematics?

1343
01:18:41,020 --> 01:18:41,970
They won't let him, right.

1344
01:18:42,060 --> 01:18:44,720
So, 
we lost a mathematics genius.

1345
01:18:44,850 --> 01:18:48,390
Head master ma'am, 
toppers are not genius.

1346
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:50,470
You can take it as, 
they're good at mugging up.

1347
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:54,390
This system has turned engineers 
into food delivery boys.

1348
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:56,220
That means, 
the system is a failure.

1349
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:15,390
What crap is this, it's in English.

1350
01:19:15,430 --> 01:19:16,850
What is this letter about?

1351
01:19:18,180 --> 01:19:20,520
Coming week, there's district 
level tournament happening.

1352
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:25,430
Fine, we'll do it.

1353
01:19:26,140 --> 01:19:28,520
District level tournaments 
are about to begin

1354
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:31,640
even this year our school's 
name should be in papers.

1355
01:19:31,930 --> 01:19:32,810
Ok, Sir.

1356
01:19:32,890 --> 01:19:33,810
If that doesn't happen

1357
01:19:34,140 --> 01:19:36,520
you can't find your names 
under teachers list.

1358
01:19:37,180 --> 01:19:39,520
Don't even bother to 
collect your salaries.

1359
01:19:41,060 --> 01:19:42,140
Ok, Sir.

1360
01:19:48,270 --> 01:19:50,180
You're always munching.

1361
01:19:50,390 --> 01:19:52,220
That's exercise for the mouth.

1362
01:19:52,350 --> 01:19:53,430
I'm not working out though

1363
01:19:53,470 --> 01:19:55,720
-at least let my mouth work out 
-you'll never change.

1364
01:19:55,930 --> 01:19:57,810
You're faking the accounts right? 
Keep at it.

1365
01:19:57,850 --> 01:19:59,680
The road looks hazy, 
after evaluating the papers.

1366
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:01,350
Sir good morning, sir. 
Sir, good morning.

1367
01:20:01,810 --> 01:20:03,100

01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:05,310
-For what? 
-I have no idea.

1369
01:20:06,470 --> 01:20:08,470
Sir, give me your hand

You gathered a crowd, right?

1372
01:20:13,770 --> 01:20:16,220
Congratulations for 
your suspension.

1373

Go, I have to eat my chips.

1374

Tell me teacher, 
you had summoned me.

Take this.

Madam, he's a maths teacher.

1381
01:20:46,180 --> 01:20:48,060
-I'm a Tamizh teacher. 
-Oh!

1382
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:51,100
Are you looking for OD 
or money from PTA funds

1383
01:20:51,390 --> 01:20:53,720
there's no set rule that a 
Tamizh teacher has to attend it.

1384
01:20:54,350 --> 01:20:56,350
Last 6 years, 
you've been in-charge

1385
01:20:56,770 --> 01:20:58,680
our school never won a prize.

1386

This year even if 
he can't win a prize

1387

there's no difference in it.

1388

He managed to gather a 
crowd for the protest.

1389
01:21:06,180 --> 01:21:08,850
We'll finally know, 
if he's really worth it or a dummy.

seen close to the field

disqualify their team.

Over here, my verdict is final.

Madam, we should be winning

1402
01:22:46,020 --> 01:22:47,270
their measurements are wrong.

1403
01:22:47,350 --> 01:22:48,470
Won't you question them?

1404
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:49,850
Your anger is valid

1405
01:22:50,180 --> 01:22:51,930
but you're venting it 
out at the wrong place.

1406
01:22:54,220 --> 01:22:56,350
Sir, 
shall I ask you 3 questions?

1407
01:22:56,390 --> 01:22:57,220
Mmmm, go on.

1408
01:22:57,350 --> 01:22:58,680
Sir, do you have a clear vision?

1409
01:22:58,890 --> 01:23:00,680
Or at least you know the 
difference between one and two?

1410
01:23:00,770 --> 01:23:02,640
Wait, 
let me ask the 3rd question

1411
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:04,890
will you agree, if your child 
is given a different initial?

1412
01:23:04,930 --> 01:23:06,890
You're giving away their 
rightful victory to someone else.

1413
01:23:07,220 --> 01:23:09,850
Damn it! How dare you 
speak to me like that?

1414
01:23:10,060 --> 01:23:11,890
I'll whack you. 
I'm disqualifying your team.

I'm gonna disqualify your entire school.

our school's name?

Why do you look so nervous?

1422
01:23:25,350 --> 01:23:26,890
I can feel your heartbeat 
on your shoulder.

1423
01:23:27,180 --> 01:23:28,600
I'm scared that we'll 
lose the competition.

1424
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:30,060
If that's the 
case, it's awesome.

1425
01:23:30,470 --> 01:23:32,020
Only the winner 
should be scared.

why should be scared?

01:31:56,970 --> 01:31:58,060
That's awesome, son.

1536
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:01,520
Murgesan +1 A2, Third Prize

1537
01:32:02,470 --> 01:32:03,270
Come over here

1538
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:05,560
-Come on... 
-Mom, where are you taking me?

1539
01:32:05,640 --> 01:32:06,470
I said, come with me.

1540
01:32:11,390 --> 01:32:13,140
Now do you agree 
my son is a winner?

1541
01:32:15,560 --> 01:32:17,100
Kumar +2 C2...

1542
01:32:17,140 --> 01:32:19,850
Your son, will never prosper 
'cause of his actions

1543
01:32:19,890 --> 01:32:21,390
he'll be tarnished into the dust

1544
01:32:21,680 --> 01:32:23,890
he'll be unsuccessful 
and loiter the streets

1545
01:32:26,390 --> 01:32:27,640
You are the right person.

1546
01:32:29,060 --> 01:32:31,600
I was scared, 
how my son's life would turn out

1547
01:33:00,100 --> 01:33:02,310
Sir, you sent a flower bouquet

1548
01:33:02,470 --> 01:33:03,720
but nothing happened

1549
01:33:05,020 --> 01:33:06,680
It will happen, have patience.

1550
01:33:18,140 --> 01:33:19,390
May I come in, Madam?

1551
01:33:20,970 --> 01:33:22,390
May I please come in, Madam?

1552
01:33:23,060 --> 01:33:23,970
Come in.

1553
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:29,560
I'm coming from MSC School.

1554
01:33:29,720 --> 01:33:32,470
Our correspondent 
sent me to meet you.

1555
01:33:33,930 --> 01:33:34,720
Sit down!

1556
01:33:36,060 --> 01:33:37,060
Thank you, Madam.

1557
01:33:39,270 --> 01:33:41,350
Your work is amazing.

1558
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:43,470
The entire town is 
raving about you.

1559
01:33:44,470 --> 01:33:47,850
Your services shouldn't be 
constrained to this small circle.

1560
01:33:47,970 --> 01:33:51,060
The Govt. 
won't respect your talent.

1561
01:33:51,220 --> 01:33:54,020
Only the Private Sector, 
will know your rightful place

1562
01:33:54,140 --> 01:33:55,600
how to raise your bar

1563
01:33:55,640 --> 01:33:57,390
also how to respect your talents.

1564
01:33:57,520 --> 01:34:00,350
what I'm trying to say 
is, at our MSC School

1565
01:34:00,770 --> 01:34:02,350
should take up the position 
of respectable Head Master.

1566
01:34:02,430 --> 01:34:04,140
That's our Sir's wish too.

1567
01:34:04,770 --> 01:34:07,970
To express that friendship, 
he sent a bouquet.

1568
01:34:09,220 --> 01:34:10,970
Also... one another thing

1569
01:34:12,430 --> 01:34:13,180
Take this.

1570
01:34:13,470 --> 01:34:15,430
-What is it? 
-5 Lacs in cash.

1571
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:17,180
Sir asked to give it to you.

1572
01:34:17,680 --> 01:34:19,930
You want me to work in your 
favor, right?

1573
01:34:22,680 --> 01:34:25,850
If I meet him, will convey 
that you were grateful to him.

1574
01:34:27,100 --> 01:34:28,270
Please take this and leave.

1575
01:34:30,020 --> 01:34:32,680
Madam, 
Sir is a very good person.

1576
01:34:32,970 --> 01:34:34,850
You just list your demands

1577
01:34:35,140 --> 01:34:37,140
I'll speak to Sir and 
make arrangements.

1578
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:42,220
You seem wiser

1579
01:34:42,430 --> 01:34:45,220
should've given a thought, 
when this job was given to you

1580
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:47,270
-That... 
-but you didn't

1581
01:34:48,100 --> 01:34:49,100
Get out, damn it!

1582
01:34:52,930 --> 01:34:54,810
She was disrespectful, Sir

1583
01:34:55,020 --> 01:34:56,350
she asked me to get out.

1584
01:34:59,390 --> 01:35:00,720
Get out, damn it.

1585
01:35:02,180 --> 01:35:03,640
She was way better...

1586
01:35:07,970 --> 01:35:09,930
I had something else in mind.

1587
01:35:10,430 --> 01:35:11,270
What was it?

1588
01:35:11,470 --> 01:35:13,640
-I thought it was a bomb... 
-Boss...

1589
01:35:13,810 --> 01:35:16,180
Did you peck me for 
a heartless killer?

1590
01:35:16,350 --> 01:35:18,270
You're asking to 
kill the children.

1591
01:35:18,520 --> 01:35:20,680
You're not fit to be a teacher.

1592
01:35:20,770 --> 01:35:23,100
There's a huge difference 
between killing and winning.

1593
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:24,770
She bloody challenged me

1594
01:35:24,890 --> 01:35:26,220
I will win against her.

1595
01:35:26,430 --> 01:35:28,560
But, you get out from my school.

1596
01:35:28,600 --> 01:35:29,390
Get out!

1597
01:35:35,310 --> 01:35:37,270
I have another idea, Sir.

1598
01:35:37,560 --> 01:35:38,430
What is it?

1599
01:35:39,270 --> 01:35:42,680
82 students who failed 
the 9th grade last year--

1600
01:35:42,810 --> 01:35:44,970
--were cleared and sent 
to the 10th grade by her.

1601
01:35:45,060 --> 01:35:46,390
Exams are going to 
start in 10 days.

1602
01:35:46,770 --> 01:35:48,220
the hall tickets have come.

1603
01:35:48,470 --> 01:35:52,270
Lawyer advised that, 
we can file a case against her.

1604
01:35:52,600 --> 01:35:53,720
You've said it right?

1605
01:35:54,100 --> 01:35:55,310
The Idea is good.

1606
01:35:55,560 --> 01:35:56,560
I'll take care of it.

1607
01:35:57,560 --> 01:35:59,770
Don't be inside my 
school, just get out.

1608
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:03,720
Disgusting Creature!

1609
01:36:04,390 --> 01:36:05,770
Clean the spot, 
where he was standing

1610
01:36:06,470 --> 01:36:08,680
-Call my son-in-law 
-Ok, Boss.

1611
01:36:33,100 --> 01:36:34,100
Come in

1612
01:36:37,890 --> 01:36:39,600
What did you get me today?

1613
01:36:39,770 --> 01:36:41,270
I didn't get anything.

1614
01:36:42,270 --> 01:36:43,140
Then?

1615
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:45,810
People came to ask my 
neighbor's hand in marriage.

1616
01:36:46,100 --> 01:36:46,890
Oh-Oh!

1617
01:36:46,970 --> 01:36:47,970
I asked them why?

1618
01:36:48,100 --> 01:36:51,600
Asking ones hand in marriage 
is the first step to marriage.

1619
01:36:52,220 --> 01:36:53,600
Then you have to get engaged.

1620
01:36:53,770 --> 01:36:56,140
Later you can get married 
at your convenience.

1621
01:36:56,470 --> 01:36:57,180
So...?

1622
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:00,310
Shall I ask your 
hand in marriage?

1623
01:37:01,220 --> 01:37:03,020
Ey-- you're going overboard.

1624
01:37:03,350 --> 01:37:05,560
Should I call your parents?

1625
01:37:06,430 --> 01:37:09,100
Not required, my brother will 
come and ask your hand in marriage

1626
01:37:09,270 --> 01:37:11,270
my brother studies 
here too, in 7th grade

1627
01:37:11,430 --> 01:37:13,270
I'm gonna whack you, 
go back to the class.

1628
01:37:17,140 --> 01:37:18,560
Are you angry?

1629
01:37:25,020 --> 01:37:27,520
Sir, here take this new pencil.

1630
01:37:29,640 --> 01:37:31,430
Wow, the one with the 
rubber on the back.

1631
01:37:35,430 --> 01:37:36,850
He's a tiny brat

1632
01:37:37,220 --> 01:37:38,810
he's speaking about 
marriage and engagement.

1633
01:37:38,970 --> 01:37:40,850
May be he's reminding 
you of something.

1634
01:37:41,680 --> 01:37:44,270
People are still asking 
your hand in marriage.

1635
01:37:45,560 --> 01:37:49,060
Dear, you still haven't moved 
on, right?

1636
01:37:56,220 --> 01:37:57,140
Please get to bed.

1637
01:37:57,680 --> 01:37:58,390
Goodnight!

1638
01:37:59,470 --> 01:38:01,560
you always find 
ways to shut me up.

1639
01:38:23,930 --> 01:38:25,560
Dad, didn't you go 
for your morning walk?

1640
01:38:29,890 --> 01:38:30,720
Dad!

1641
01:38:34,770 --> 01:38:35,470

Stone-Hearted!

1690
01:43:06,930 --> 01:43:07,720
Dear...

1691
01:43:07,890 --> 01:43:09,720
...you made my favourite curry

1692
01:43:09,890 --> 01:43:11,060
It was delicious.

1693
01:43:11,720 --> 01:43:14,390
Tomorrow make your 
specialty chicken pulav--

1694
01:43:14,600 --> 01:43:15,930
--I feel like having it.

1695
01:43:17,220 --> 01:43:19,600
Dear, are you stressed out?

1696
01:43:19,850 --> 01:43:21,270
Ah-- now Dad's gonna treat you

1697
01:43:21,390 --> 01:43:22,350
close your eyes.

1698
01:43:24,100 --> 01:43:25,350
Take a deep breath.

1699
01:43:29,140 --> 01:43:30,270
Feel free...

1700
01:43:31,680 --> 01:43:32,560
Ok!

1701
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:34,600
Bye, dear.

1702
01:43:44,140 --> 01:43:45,220
I love you, Daddy.

1703
01:43:58,810 --> 01:44:01,520
Are students ready 
for their exam?

1704
01:44:26,890 --> 01:44:28,720
I too pecked you 
for a stone-hearted.

1705
01:44:29,060 --> 01:44:31,430
You have every 
right to be angry.

1706
01:44:51,520 --> 01:44:53,430
Sir, just like you asked--

1707
01:44:53,560 --> 01:44:55,970
--we settled it with your 
brother-in-law at Dindivanam.

1708
01:44:57,310 --> 01:44:59,180
-Your work will be done 
-Thank you.

1709
01:45:07,020 --> 01:45:08,350
-Father-in-law 
-What's the status?

1710
01:45:08,430 --> 01:45:09,560
I just got done with the job.

1711
01:45:09,680 --> 01:45:10,970
your timing was perfect.

1712
01:45:11,140 --> 01:45:12,060
The deal is done.

1713
01:45:12,430 --> 01:45:14,640
Not even a student can 
write the exam tomorrow.

1714
01:45:14,890 --> 01:45:15,680
That's great.

1715
01:45:17,020 --> 01:45:19,220
Students, you guys are 
ready to write your exams

1716
01:45:19,770 --> 01:45:21,600
you're going to 
face many changes.

1717
01:45:22,430 --> 01:45:23,720
But I have a penitence

1718
01:45:24,770 --> 01:45:26,220
the year is about to 
end, since I got here.

1719
01:45:27,970 --> 01:45:29,350
I never did any work.

1720
01:45:29,470 --> 01:45:30,850
She never worked?

1721
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:33,390
I pushed you guys to study.

1722
01:45:33,680 --> 01:45:35,560
I pushed them to 
teach you guys.

1723
01:45:35,930 --> 01:45:38,850
If you gain victory, 
it's the result of your hard work

1724
01:45:39,640 --> 01:45:42,140
In case, if something goes wrong

1725
01:45:42,350 --> 01:45:43,930
I'm fully responsible for it.

1726
01:45:44,310 --> 01:45:47,470
I envy looking at few 
teachers over here.

1727
01:45:48,600 --> 01:45:50,430
The books he selects 
for the students

1728
01:45:50,560 --> 01:45:52,890
if its read in full, 
he rewards them with 100 rupees.

1729
01:45:53,140 --> 01:45:55,810
He stands by the notion, 
that books can change the society.

1730
01:45:56,720 --> 01:45:59,140
Practical skills of their sort--

1731
01:45:59,560 --> 01:46:01,310
--is equal to Noble thesis.

1732
01:46:01,560 --> 01:46:03,310
An entire Maths formula--

1733
01:46:03,640 --> 01:46:05,310
--he's turns them into a song

1734
01:46:05,470 --> 01:46:07,100
and makes the students sing it.

1735
01:46:07,520 --> 01:46:08,810
My only penitence is

1736
01:46:09,430 --> 01:46:12,220
that only a handful 
teachers are available.

1737
01:46:13,180 --> 01:46:16,140
In spite of advanced technology, 
you people are backward.

1738
01:46:16,770 --> 01:46:21,020
In Govt.Medical College, not even 1% 
is allotted to Govt.School students.

1739
01:46:21,680 --> 01:46:24,770
And in Govt. 
Engineering colleges is less than 5%.

1740
01:46:25,140 --> 01:46:29,100
Students who are below poverty 
line study at Govt. Schools.

1741
01:46:29,560 --> 01:46:32,310
Just 50% reservation for 
their higher education

1742
01:46:32,600 --> 01:46:33,970
we can eradicate 
the poverty line.

1743
01:46:34,470 --> 01:46:39,180
But I'm unsure, what is the Govt's 
idea of eradicating the poverty.

1744
01:46:40,640 --> 01:46:41,640
If that's the case

1745
01:46:43,180 --> 01:46:44,350
how long will be our run?

1746
01:46:45,180 --> 01:46:46,770
Based on your scores

1747
01:46:46,970 --> 01:46:49,350
the world is waiting 
to grade you.

1748
01:46:50,470 --> 01:46:54,810
Just like finger prints, 
everyone has peculiar talents.

1749
01:46:55,180 --> 01:46:58,220
Only if you discover 
it, this is possible.

1750
01:46:59,390 --> 01:47:02,600
My best wishes, to 
everyone for the exams.

1751
01:47:07,930 --> 01:47:09,390
It was a meticulous plan, madam

1752
01:47:09,720 --> 01:47:12,640
the students you cleared, 
can't write exams tomorrow.

1753
01:48:03,180 --> 01:48:04,310
Good Morning, Teacher.

1754
01:48:12,020 --> 01:48:13,720
Hurry up, we're getting late.

1755
01:48:30,890 --> 01:48:32,180
Madam, please sign here

1756
01:48:32,270 --> 01:48:33,430
the question papers have arrived.

1757
01:48:33,640 --> 01:48:35,520
-How many? 
-Not sure, how many...

1758
01:48:42,930 --> 01:48:44,720
Hurry up, it's Hall No.7

1759
01:48:44,850 --> 01:48:46,220
-Let's meet after the exam 
-Ok.

1760
01:48:50,100 --> 01:48:51,020
Give to her...

1761
01:48:51,560 --> 01:48:52,390
...pass it on

1762
01:48:53,270 --> 01:48:54,520
Just look at the questions

1763
01:48:54,680 --> 01:48:55,470
put down your number

1764
01:49:17,060 --> 01:49:19,060
Ey-- why haven't we got 
our question papers yet?

1765
01:49:42,350 --> 01:49:45,310
Madam, please can you move. 
I'm running late.

1766
01:49:47,770 --> 01:49:48,770
Everyone, please sit down.

1767
01:49:51,600 --> 01:49:52,720
Please pass this over

1768
01:49:53,060 --> 01:49:55,520
as I was late, you'll get 
extra ten minutes, don't panic.

1769
01:50:07,850 --> 01:50:10,220
Father-in-law, 
how is the victory treating you

1770
01:50:10,560 --> 01:50:12,430
Damn it! They're writing the 
exam, get to the court

1771
01:50:13,390 --> 01:50:15,020
How did this happen?

1772
01:50:21,520 --> 01:50:23,020
"It was a meticulous plan, madam

1773
01:50:23,220 --> 01:50:26,180
the students you cleared, 
can't write exams tomorrow."

1774
01:50:31,810 --> 01:50:33,720
Dad, 
Head Master is on the phone.

1775
01:50:40,770 --> 01:50:42,680
Hello Sir, how are you?

1776
01:50:43,850 --> 01:50:46,140
I'm good, how are you?

1777
01:50:47,640 --> 01:50:49,770
I need a favor from you.

1778
01:50:50,600 --> 01:50:51,600
Favor!?

1779
01:50:52,600 --> 01:50:53,430
Please tell me.

1780
01:50:53,640 --> 01:50:56,850
There's an issue with our 
students in writing their exams.

1781
01:50:57,640 --> 01:50:59,270
Please, you have to 
speak to the Minister.

1782
01:50:59,970 --> 01:51:02,430
Officers can't surpass 
Minister's orders.

1783
01:51:04,060 --> 01:51:05,850
I'm not able to turn 
down your request.

1784
01:51:06,810 --> 01:51:08,640
I'm going to talk to 
him after 7 years.

1785
01:51:08,850 --> 01:51:10,810
That too, 
it's only for Geetha Teacher.

1786
01:51:13,140 --> 01:51:14,020
Thank you.

1787
01:51:30,600 --> 01:51:32,430
-Father-in-law 
-What happened?

1788
01:51:33,020 --> 01:51:35,060
We didn't get a stay 
order from high court.

1789
01:51:35,220 --> 01:51:36,720
They pushed it by 6 weeks.

1790
01:51:37,020 --> 01:51:38,310
Summer vacations.

1791
01:51:38,970 --> 01:51:39,890
Hearings!

1792
01:51:41,180 --> 01:51:42,350
Did we lose?

1793
01:51:42,430 --> 01:51:43,430
We didn't!

1794
01:51:43,600 --> 01:51:46,720
I'll go to the bench, get a hold 
of someone and get the judgment.

1795
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:48,680
You don't have to worry.

1796
01:51:48,810 --> 01:51:50,520
I'll go to extremes to win this.

1797
01:52:02,810 --> 01:52:07,220
[OVERLAPPING CHATTER]

1798
01:52:15,680 --> 01:52:18,810
Vanakkam Head Master, 
how are you?

1799
01:52:18,970 --> 01:52:20,520
I thought of coming 
to your house--

1800
01:52:20,770 --> 01:52:24,560
--it's a pity that your father 
is no more to offer me tea.

1801
01:52:25,810 --> 01:52:27,140
Deepest condolences.

1802
01:52:27,430 --> 01:52:29,220
I came down to thank you.

1803
01:52:29,600 --> 01:52:31,180
I was damn lazy--

1804
01:52:31,270 --> 01:52:32,850
--but you turned me very agile.

1805
01:52:33,310 --> 01:52:35,350
By making me work.

1806
01:52:35,810 --> 01:52:38,220
moreover, you're standing 
in accordance with me.

1807
01:52:39,180 --> 01:52:41,020
When the school 
reopens next year

1808
01:52:41,180 --> 01:52:43,930
not only you, 
but the students who you cleared

1809
01:52:44,140 --> 01:52:45,560
won't step inside the school.

1810
01:52:47,140 --> 01:52:49,140
More than working for the people

1811
01:52:49,310 --> 01:52:51,890
Govt. employees work 
for us diligently.

1812
01:52:53,390 --> 01:52:54,390
I'll take a leave.

01:53:56,640 --> 01:53:59,220
Results are coming in tomorrow, 
so heading to prep for it.

1819
01:53:59,850 --> 01:54:01,310
We should get rid of exams--

1820
01:54:01,390 --> 01:54:03,060

it another day.

1822

how come you're at school today?

1823
01:54:33,720 --> 01:54:34,890
-Vanakkam! 
-Hmmm.

1824
01:54:35,350 --> 01:54:37,600
I'm retiring from 
the school today.

1825
01:54:39,430 --> 01:54:42,020
Unfortunately, it's a holiday 
on the day of my retirement.

1826
01:54:42,600 --> 01:54:43,890
Once the school reopens

1827
01:54:44,850 --> 01:54:46,520
you'll just solicit 
my retirement.

1828
01:54:48,930 --> 01:54:49,770
Please come.

1829
01:55:03,470 --> 01:55:04,970
This school and I

1830
01:55:06,220 --> 01:55:08,060
have an never ending bond.

1831
01:55:10,310 --> 01:55:11,520
My husband

1832
01:55:12,680 --> 01:55:14,810
worked as a Teacher 
at this school.

01:55:16,890 --> 01:55:18,890
This is were we met 
and then got married.

1834
01:55:20,350 --> 01:55:21,680
I've got a son

1835
01:55:22,890 --> 01:55:24,520
he too studied at this school.

1836
01:55:27,430 --> 01:55:28,770
He must be of your age.

1837
01:55:31,850 --> 01:55:33,140
Once he completed M.Ed.

1838
01:55:35,470 --> 01:55:37,060
he took up a job over here.

1839
01:55:37,850 --> 01:55:39,770
also got his appointment order

he started the job

01:56:07,350 --> 01:56:08,850
I studied with him.

1849

Once I completed 
B.Ed I joined Army.

1850
01:56:13,390 --> 01:56:17,430
We decided to get married, 
once he gets a job.

1851
01:56:19,890 --> 01:56:20,970
He did get a job.

1852
01:56:22,640 --> 01:56:24,560
He asked when shall 
we get married--

1853
01:56:26,100 --> 01:56:28,930
--then he bid goodbye 
at Madurai Airport

1854
01:56:30,890 --> 01:56:32,140
while he was returning

1855
01:56:33,270 --> 01:56:35,520

1856
01:56:37,220 --> 01:56:38,810
--got to me a month later

more than we spoke about us

1859
01:56:50,270 --> 01:56:53,020
we discussed how 
to run a school.

1860
01:56:55,220 --> 01:56:57,020
But now, 
it's just me at this school.

1861
01:56:58,220 --> 01:57:00,770
He did mention, 
that will bring a girl like a Queen.

1862
01:57:04,640 --> 01:57:05,930
That's how he used to call me.

Madam, just one question

2047
02:08:48,350 --> 02:08:50,020
Teacher we passed the exam.

2048
02:08:54,140 --> 02:08:56,560
Teacher, 
my son has cleared the exams too.

2049
02:08:56,680 --> 02:08:58,220
He has scored, 412.

2050
02:08:58,430 --> 02:08:59,680
Thanks a lot, Teacher.

2051
02:09:18,100 --> 02:09:19,890
Just speaking 
about the injustice

2052
02:09:20,470 --> 02:09:21,850
but not putting an end to it

2053
02:09:22,060 --> 02:09:24,390
instead keep along with it

2054
02:09:24,720 --> 02:09:27,020
become a part of the injustice.

2055
02:09:27,470 --> 02:09:29,310
But who oppose them,

2056
02:09:30,220 --> 02:09:31,680
they become History.
