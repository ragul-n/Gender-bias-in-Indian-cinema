1
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:09,520
Revenge! Revenge! Revenge!

2
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:14,400
I'm back for revenge
And to destroy you all

3
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:18,400
You will witness the wrath of Kaal

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,880
Revenge!

5
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:25,280
I haven't forgotten my old enemy

6
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:30,760
You will pay
For what you've done to me

7
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,680
Revenge!

8
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,760
You will not win this game
You will be in pain

9
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,840
I'm mighty, I'm the destroyer

10
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:46,760
I won't rest until I seek revenge!

11
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,280
Revenge!

12
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,320
Your hearts will pound
You will be out of breath

13
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,000
The worst hasn't come to you yet

14
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:05,280
The revenge of Kaal!

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,600
It's time to use these magic marbles.

16
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,000
Magic marbles,

17
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,040
show me the path
that leads to Kaal Rakshas.

18
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,200
Evil spirits of the netherworld,
it's time to summon Kaal Rakshas!

19
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,760
Evil spirits of the netherworld,
wake Kaal Rakshas up.

20
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,760
Kaal has come to wreak havoc!
Destruction!

21
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:05,000
There will be destruction!
Destruction! Destruction!

22
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:10,080
No! This is all about my revenge!
Revenge! Revenge!

23
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,280
Little Singham, revenge!

24
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,720
I'm back for revenge
And to destroy you all

25
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,120
Revenge!

26
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,640
Lionheart! Lionheart! Lionheart!

27
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,720
I welcome you all
to the Grand Lionheart Festival.

28
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:51,920
Here we honor all lionhearts.

29
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,480
Today, my prestige is sky-high.

30
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,840
Lionheart! Lionheart! Lionheart!

31
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,640
I was a fan of Little Singham before.

32
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:11,320
But today, I will be a fanatic!

33
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,040
When Little Singham
and the three lionheart monsters clash,

34
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:19,680
there will be action, and lots of zeal!

35
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:31,280
Lattu, why don't you leave the action
to Little Singham sir, with the baton?

36
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,920
Hey, Karate!

37
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,320
Why don't you tell that to yourself!
And control your baton!

38
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,240
Newton's sauce!
Look at that!

39
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,480
Hey! Kalari Warrior!

40
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:15,760
Kalari Warrior! Sand-Man! Brave Lion!

41
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:21,080
Please welcome these lionheart saviors
with a huge round of applause.

42
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,640
There's still one lionheart missing.

43
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,920
Where is India's youngest supercop?

44
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,000
Police uniform and the strength of a lion!
He is Little Singham

45
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,760
He can beat all villains together.

46
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,920
His name is Little Singham.

47
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,600
I saw there was a lack of charm
at the Lionheart Festival.

48
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,240
Hence, I'm here.

49
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,560
All four lionhearts are here.

50
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:10,600
The moment we were waiting for is here.

51
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,640
Now, there will be a competition
between Little Singham and the lionhearts.

52
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,920
-A competition?
-Wow!

53
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,560
Such fantastic action already!

54
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,880
A real policeman
is never afraid of a fight.

55
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,760
We will be the obstacles in your way.

56
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:46,160
Let's see who is the mightiest!

57
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:55,440
The scarf is a little far away,
but I accept the challenge.

58
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:28,480
Oh, no! Looks like a lion
has captured another lion.

59
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:41,840
Oh, look!
Someone got away from an old lion!

60
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,240
Seems like the lion has poor eyesight.

61
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,920
The spear has landed far away.

62
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,720
Now tell me, who has poor eyesight?

63
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:35,240
Little Singham, you won't always
be attacked from the front.

64
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,600
It could be from behind too.

65
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,560
I am gonna go crazy!

66
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,960
Police uniform and the strength of a lion
He's little but second to none

67
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:06,320
You may attack me from anywhere,
but a lion can defend itself very well.

68
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:11,960
Police uniform and the strength of a lion!
He is Little Singham

69
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,760
He is Little Singham

70
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,520
That is what I call heroism.

71
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,160
Little Singham! Little Singham!

72
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,760
Bravo, Little Singham. You amazed us
by taking back your scarf!

73
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:02,040
Little Singham, you were a tough one
for us to defeat.

74
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:07,640
All of us are lionhearts.
But I have got some style too.

75
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:14,080
Wow! That was fun.

76
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:19,400
On that note, Little Singham
and the other three lionhearts

77
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,440
will be lighting the Lionheart Flame.

78
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,640
The Lionheart Flame says it aloud.

79
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,120
Bravery shall win and evil shall lose.

80
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,200
Friendship, bravery and zeal.

81
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:55,680
When these three come together,
it makes you a lionheart.

82
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,920
The medallions for these three
have been placed

83
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,400
in three different parts of the world.

84
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,000
Lionheart! Lionheart!

85
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,520
Danger! Here?

86
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:48,360
No! What's happening!
Lionheart warriors?

87
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,400
Destruction!

88
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,360
Kaal Rakshas!

89
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,480
Are you surprised, Little Singham?

90
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,680
Kaal Rakshas, we had put you
to eternal sleep.

91
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,360
How did you come back?

92
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:25,080
I'm back to destroy you, Little Singham!

93
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:29,520
-I'm here for revenge.
-You will not be spared, Kaal Rakshas!

94
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,760
Lionheart warriors!

95
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,200
You seem so small and weak

96
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:54,600
in front of my new powers, Little Singham.

97
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,560
Today, you are all alone.

98
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:03,040
Your three warriors have become
my slaves now.

99
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:08,800
Don't underestimate the power
of a lionheart.

100
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:14,360
Show me your powers, then!
Are you scared? Come!

101
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,800
Smash him.

102
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,040
No! Little Singham!

103
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:49,520
-Help! Help!
-Run!

104
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:55,720
Today, evil will win,
and goodness will lose!

105
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,960
-This is Sand-Man's attack!
-Kalari Warrior in action!

106
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,640
Face the wrath of Brave Lion.

107
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,760
I can't fight them all together.

108
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:24,320
-Little Singham!
-No, friends. Stop right there.

109
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:29,120
You will find a way.
You have to see it through my vision.

110
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,120
Sir!

111
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:50,680
-What's this? Where did Little Singham go?
-Little Singham!

112
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:02,360
Kaal has come to wreak havoc!
Destruction!

113
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,560
Little Singham, where did you go?

114
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:13,280
Chikki, Lattu, Babli, we can't face
Kaal's powers right now.

115
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,640
-Let's go.
-Coward little creatures.

116
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:36,960
Revenge! Revenge! Revenge!

117
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:45,200
Revenge! Revenge! Revenge!

118
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:50,560
I'm back for revenge
And to destroy you all

119
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:54,560
You will witness the wrath of Kaal

120
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,000
Revenge!

121
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:01,440
I haven't forgotten my old enemy

122
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:06,880
You will pay
For what you've done to me

123
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,280
Revenge!

124
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:14,560
You will not win this game
You will be in pain

125
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,800
I'm mighty, I'm the destroyer

126
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,920
I won't rest until I seek revenge!

127
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,040
Revenge!

128
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:29,600
Your hearts will pound
You will be out of breath

129
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:35,120
The worst hasn't come to you yet

130
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,400
The revenge of Kaal!

131
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:53,160
What just happened, Kavya ma'am?
Sir is gone!

132
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,680
I don't understand.

133
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:05,560
Mirchi Nagar's hero has disappeared!
How could this happen?

134
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,960
Even Kaal Rakshas has returned.
We are in grave danger.

135
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:16,160
Only Little Singham could face him.
All we have is his photos and memories.

136
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:24,440
Remember what Little Singham had said.
Bravery, friendship and zeal.

137
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:27,640
You can be a lionheart
with these three qualities.

138
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,920
Yes, ma'am. There must be a secret
behind these words,

139
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,800
using which we can defeat
Kaal Rakshas again.

140
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:40,440
That means we have to collect
these three lionheart medallions.

141
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,280
But where will we find them?

142
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:48,680
He has left his goggles with us.
Little Singham seemed so happy.

143
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:57,280
I found it! I found it!
The map to the medallions.

144
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,560
Oh, no. I think Lattu is in shock

145
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:07,080
since Little Singham is gone.

146
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,760
Look carefully.

147
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,480
We don't see anything in this, Lattu.
Where is the map?

148
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,640
It's right in front of you.

149
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,640
Hey! What's this?

150
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:28,000
Now I understood why Little Singham
told us to see through his vision.

151
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,480
You can see the map only through
the goggles. Look, Babli.

152
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:35,560
Oh, yes. This is the map
for all the three medallions.

153
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:44,240
We do not have much time.
We need to form three teams.

154
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,920
Then, we have to collect
all the medallions as soon as possible.

155
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,800
Yes! Good idea, Professor.

156
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:55,280
Karate, Chikki, and I will go to
Tashangarh to find the Zeal medallion.

157
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:59,560
Lattu and Babli will go to Bhutan
to collect the Friendship medallion.

158
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,760
Professor Avishkar and Mantriji will go
to the Bermuda Triangle

159
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,600
to get the medallion of Bravery.

160
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:11,840
That's fine. But are we taking a bus,
a train or an auto rickshaw?

161
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:19,880
Karate, busses and trains
won't get us there.

162
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:23,200
We will fly. Won't we, Dad?

163
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,640
Newton's sauce.
You're right, Babli.

164
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,000
I'll get my jet ready in a snap.

165
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,880
Little Singham has saved us from evil
several times.

166
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,000
Now, we will accomplish this mission
of Little Singham.

167
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:43,040
-We'll put an end to the menace of Kaal.
-For Little Singham!

168
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,640
First stop, Tashangarh.

169
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,120
Kavya, Karate, and Chikki.
Are you guys ready?

170
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,760
We're ready, Professor.

171
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:11,600
Kavya ma'am, there's a jungle below
and the sky above.

172
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:18,200
My life is stuck in between.
Ma'am, what if something goes wrong?

173
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:37,520
Karate!
Release the parachute. Now.

174
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,400
ZEAL

175
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:29,880
I welcome you all to Tashangarh.
I'm Pajama Mama.

176
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,480
Mama who?

177
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,040
Z-E-A-L Mama.

178
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:48,240
Day or night, you'll see everyone in zeal
in Tashangarh.

179
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:53,920
-I'm energetic too.
-Karate, you can show off later.

180
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,320
We're here for the medallion of Zeal.

181
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:01,320
If you need the medallion of Zeal,
you must be energetic too.

182
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:06,200
You must have fun in everything.
Make everything energetic.

183
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,960
Are you ready to have some fun?

184
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,320
-Yes, we are.
-Yes, we are.

185
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,480
The medallion of Zeal...

186
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,240
is here.

187
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,840
-The medallion of Zeal!
-Zeal! Zeal! Zeal!

188
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:56,400
It's going to be a battle of zeal!
Wonderful!

189
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:03,280
-A battle of zeal?
-Yes!

190
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:08,280
I'm the king of zeal.
Play the beats!

191
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,040
Here's the first challenge.

192
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,880
What happened?
Come on, start.

193
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,520
Ma'am, we need to up our game.

194
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,880
My zeal is always on!

195
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:52,000
-What do we do now, ma'am?
-I don't think we can beat this man.

196
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:56,200
I hope Lattu and Babli succeed
in getting the Friendship medallion.

197
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:01,960
What do I do?
I'll jump now, Babli.

198
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,840
My body is wrecked!

199
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,960
Such a big goat!

200
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:36,040
This is Bhutan's national animal, Takin.

201
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:40,760
It's similar to a goat.
Come on now, let's go.

202
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,280
Bye, Takin. See you later.

203
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,520
What do we say? Yes!

204
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,560
Lattu says hello.

205
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:07,320
Can you help us out? We need to go
to the Paro Taktsang monastery

206
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,320
to get the Friendship medallion.

207
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,560
-Oh, wow!
-No!

208
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:20,160
-We're not hungry.
-Yes, I'm hungry.

209
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:25,080
No, Lattu. This is not our mission.
Thank you, ma'am.

210
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,320
Come on, Lattu.
Let's ask someone else.

211
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,400
Babli! Who should we ask in this crowd?

212
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:42,480
I'm starving.
Can we eat something?

213
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:46,120
Can you tell us the way
to the Paro Taktsang monastery?

214
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,880
He said the same thing.
Come on, let's ask her.

215
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,480
Ma'am, where is the
Paro Taktsang monastery?

216
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:14,320
Babli, is there something on my face?

217
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:21,160
-No, I don't see anything.
-Then why is everyone smiling at me?

218
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,960
That's because the people here
are always happy.

219
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,920
You know, Bhutan has the highest level
of happiness.

220
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:37,280
But my level of happiness is decreasing.
You didn't let me eat anything.

221
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,640
Let me get something to eat first.

222
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:45,080
Sorry, I can't even walk properly
with an empty stomach.

223
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,680
I'm Thimpu. And you?

224
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:54,200
-We're from India. I'm Babli.
-Oh, Babli?

225
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:58,880
And I'm hungry. I mean...
I'm Lattu.

226
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:03,360
Lattu is a funny name.

227
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:10,080
Hey, Thimpu, are you from
the Paro Taktsang monastery?

228
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,640
Yes.

229
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,640
Will you take us there?

230
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,480
No!

231
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:23,760
Hey, stop.
Lattu, go that way.

232
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,080
I'll go this way.
Stop Thimpu.

233
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,840
-Catch me if you can.
-Thimpu, please stop.

234
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,560
Thimpu, please stop.

235
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:45,920
-Catch me if you can.
-Thimpu, stop running.

236
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,560
Lattu?

237
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:52,840
-Thimpu, please don't run.
-Lattu... Hungry!

238
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,560
-Take this.
-Oh, fruit!

239
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,560
Thimpu, stop.

240
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,040
Lattu, did you find Thimpu?

241
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:19,120
Babli, I'm exhausted running after Thimpu.

242
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,280
Babali?

243
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,760
"Babali!"

244
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,760
Shut up, Lattu.

245
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,960
Catch me if you can.

246
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,680
Thimpu, I will catch you.

247
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,480
Hey! Just stop it now.

248
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:56,320
Look at him!
He made us run, and now he's asleep.

249
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:09,920
Thimpu, enough with the games.
We're on an important mission here.

250
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:15,960
Kaal Rakshas is back. We need
the medallion of Friendship to defeat him.

251
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:20,640
Please tell us the way to the monastery.

252
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:28,240
You know, you need to cross
a long bridge to reach the monastery.

253
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,160
Where is the bridge, Thimpu?

254
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,040
You are not my friends.
Why should I tell you?

255
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,840
Hey, stop!

256
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:50,680
Babli, he's gone.
Let's catch him.

257
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:55,160
Lattu, wait for me.
I will catch Thimpu anyhow this time.

258
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:10,040
-Where did Thimpu go? Did he disappear?
-Lattu, look at that!

259
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,760
Wow! We found it at last.

260
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:20,160
Babli, you didn't let me eat anything
in the city.

261
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:23,200
And now, you're making me wander
in this jungle.

262
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:27,840
How can I look for Thimpu
on an empty stomach?

263
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:34,400
I wish I could have something to eat.
I miss Khakra, Fafda and Jalebi.

264
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:40,560
Babli, at least let me have
some snowballs.

265
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,480
Look, footprints!
He must have gone that way.

266
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:52,920
I think he went this way.
Also, I don't want to climb up.

267
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,400
Lattu, don't argue.

268
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:02,200
This is the right way.
Anyway, I'm smarter than you.

269
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:06,040
Yes, you're smart because you think
with your brains.

270
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,239
But I think from my heart.

271
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:15,080
My heart says this is the right way.
You go your way, I'll go my way.

272
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,520
Fine, Lattu, go.

273
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:30,560
I don't know where I am.
I'm so scared.

274
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:42,080
-Little Singham!
-When you're in danger, you need friends.

275
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,719
Little Singham always said

276
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,920
that we should never let go of
our true friends.

277
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,280
Nothing is visible.

278
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:57,040
Babli! Babli!

279
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,320
It's snowing, and Thimpu's footprints
are disappearing.

280
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,400
Those footprints were mine.

281
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,400
You fell for my trap.

282
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,720
Sand-Man?

283
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,880
Help!

284
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,880
Babli!

285
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,760
Newton's sauce!

286
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,960
Our plane is going down.

287
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,600
Gravity is pulling it down.

288
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,880
That means we have reached
the Bermuda Triangle.

289
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,640
The engine has shut down.

290
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,680
Mantriji, be careful.

291
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:14,800
Avishkar, it's a storm.
I'm scared.

292
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,360
I'm safe!

293
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,480
My prestige is safe too.

294
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,160
We're not safe, Mantriji.

295
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,320
Look ahead.

296
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,800
Now we're safe.

297
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,600
What do we do now, Avishkar?

298
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:16,680
The octopus is bigger than a dinosaur.

299
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:23,800
-We will have to jump, Mantriji.
-What!

300
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:27,160
Avishkar, did I tell you

301
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:30,080
that I'm scared of water?

302
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,960
Mantriji, we will get into trouble
if we stay here.

303
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,920
If we want the Bravery medallion,

304
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,120
we will have to fight our fears.

305
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:46,120
We should have gone looking for
the Zeal medallion instead.

306
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,680
Jump, Mantriji.

307
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,360
Ma'am, do something.

308
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:13,320
My zeal is depleting.

309
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:17,080
Hey! I don't see your zeal.

310
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,680
The real battle begins now.

311
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:43,080
Now we'll show you how a lion roars.

312
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,800
Lion's roar! Lion's roar!

313
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:42,480
You three have beaten the zeal master
with your zeal.

314
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,120
We had fun, didn't we?

315
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,960
The Zeal medallion is yours.

316
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,400
Brave Lion?

317
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,360
Run!

318
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,240
I agree you have the power,

319
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,280
but I have the zeal.

320
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:01,720
Brave Lion, don't be so mad.

321
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,120
Enjoy Karate's dance.

322
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:19,200
Chikki, Karate is distracting the lion.

323
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,320
We will have to save the medallion.

324
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,360
Zeal is awesome, isn't it?

325
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,080
Help!

326
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:37,640
He didn't like my dance.

327
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:40,000
Someone help me.

328
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:47,400
Brave Lion, you're here
for this medallion, aren't you?

329
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,320
Chikki, catch it.

330
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:05,400
Chikki, throw it to me.

331
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:12,920
Wow, Chikki.

332
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:18,120
He's running towards me.

333
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,040
Help me!

334
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,440
Karate, over here.

335
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:32,280
Hero of zeal, Little Singham.

336
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,960
The lion tattoo.

337
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:01,960
Forgive me. I was under Kaal's spell.

338
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,520
It wasn't your fault, Brave Lion.

339
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,360
Wow! Amazing!

340
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,920
Your zeal was awesome.

341
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:12,680
Now, Kaal Rakshas will be finished.

342
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:17,120
That's possible when we find
the other two pieces of the medallion.

343
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,120
Help!

344
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:27,720
Babli! Babli! Babli!

345
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:30,800
Babli!

346
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,760
Oh, no. I'm squashed.

347
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,360
Lattu.

348
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:44,480
Hey, Babli! I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have left you alone.

349
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,160
I should have listened to you too.

350
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:50,200
The other route was the right way
to the monastery.

351
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:54,600
What's that horrifying sound?

352
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,280
Run, Lattu.

353
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,360
Lattu, jump.

354
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:41,560
That's the same long bridge
Thimpu told us about.

355
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:53,120
Hey! The bridge is weak.

356
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:58,600
It might break when we step on it.

357
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:02,280
We have to do this, Lattu.
Give me your hand.

358
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:04,080
We will cross this together.

359
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,840
-Hold my hand.
-You're right, Babli.

360
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:10,880
I won't let go of you this time.
Let's do this together. Come on.

361
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,440
Sand-Man?

362
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:27,120
You have walked into my trap.
No one can save you this time.

363
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,520
Who are you?

364
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,680
Stay away from my friends.

365
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,320
Thimpu, be careful.

366
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,240
Thimpu, behind you.

367
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,640
Thimpu, thank you for helping us.

368
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:27,920
Yes. We would be squashed
if it wasn't for you.

369
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,320
Both of you have cleared the test.

370
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:31,720
A test?

371
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:37,120
Yes, you didn't let each other down
during tough times.

372
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,120
Your friendship is real.

373
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:50,000
The Friendship medallion is yours.

374
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:51,800
What!

375
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:56,240
You had it?
You could have given it earlier.

376
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:00,360
Lionheart tattoo!

377
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:07,320
You threw me into the river!
It's my turn now!

378
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:10,200
Now face the power of friendship.

379
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:22,920
What's this?
Forgive me, friends.

380
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:27,000
Sand-Man!
Kaal Rakshas did this.

381
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:31,320
With the help of your friends,
you can face all troubles easily.

382
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:35,000
Yes, Little Singham also said the same.

383
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:38,240
We won't let Kaal Rakshas win.

384
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:40,880
I swear on Little Singham's friendship.

385
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:52,640
Mantriji, swim towards that island.

386
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:09,960
The medallion is very high.

387
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:13,840
How will we get it?

388
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,960
Professor Avishkar?

389
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:20,560
Over here, Mantriji.

390
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:23,680
Start climbing, Mantriji.

391
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:41,440
Good.

392
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:46,320
The octopus can't climb so high.

393
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,520
Newton's sauce.

394
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,280
I'll lose my prestige.

395
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,600
The prey is here.

396
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:18,000
Mantriji, get the medallion.

397
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,040
I'll handle them.

398
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,080
Go away! Go!
Leave, dirty pirates.

399
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,360
Wow!

400
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,840
But Avishkar, I hope you know

401
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:37,600
that I'm scared of heights.

402
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:42,520
This is not the time to be scared.
It's time to act, Mantriji.

403
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:54,760
Come on, Minister!

404
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:03,960
Back off. Step back!

405
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:14,880
Avishkar, I'm swinging.

406
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,000
We have to get the Bravery medallion
at any cost.

407
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:22,640
I can't do this!

408
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:26,760
Newton's sauce.

409
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:32,160
Mantriji, think! What would
Little Singham do if he was here?

410
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:43,840
The one who overcomes his fears
is truly brave.

411
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:46,960
I can do this.

412
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:57,320
I have got the medallion.
Wow!

413
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:03,920
I lost the medallion.

414
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:13,960
Kalari Warrior.

415
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:18,040
I was sent to collect the medallion.
This was easy.

416
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,240
New prey.

417
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:55,800
Hand over the medallion.

418
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,440
Never.

419
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:12,840
Avishkar is in danger.
I should do something.

420
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:18,520
Kalari Warrior!

421
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,240
Kalari Warrior!

422
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:42,320
I was under Kaal's spell.

423
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:45,280
But you both were so brave.

424
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:48,680
Lionheart tattoo.

425
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:51,800
What's happening?

426
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:54,280
This only goes to the ones

427
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:57,560
who are brave and honest.

428
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:03,000
Look, King Kaal, Little Singham's friends

429
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:07,520
have turned your slaves
into righteous people.

430
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:12,960
Your chances of losing are very high.

431
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:17,560
You're a fool, magician.
A fool!

432
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:21,400
You don't know about this monster
that I possess

433
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:25,320
whom people have feared for centuries now.

434
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:26,280
Who is it?

435
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,240
Zaalim Zalzala.

436
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:35,240
The Lionheart Flame says it aloud.

437
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:38,720
Bravery shall win and evil shall lose.

438
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:45,160
Lattu, we are back.

439
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:51,960
Karate, Kavya, Mantriji, Chikki!

440
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:55,480
Yes! We have completed our mission.

441
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:00,760
Kaal Rakshas has become very powerful.

442
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:04,040
-We have to stop him.
-But where is he?

443
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,880
You all have made a huge mistake.

444
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:13,520
Because Little Singham is finished.

445
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:16,600
And now you're all alone. Look.

446
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:20,120
This is your protector's last memento.

447
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,480
An ordinary uniform.

448
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:27,560
Lies! Little Singham is in our hearts.

449
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:32,720
Oh, yes. The police uniforms are here.

450
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:35,560
And also the strength of a lion,
with the baton.

451
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:45,000
Today will be the end
of Little Singham's friends

452
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:48,560
and the beginning of Kaal's rule.

453
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:53,320
My revenge will be complete.
Revenge!

454
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:54,880
Revenge!

455
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:56,720
Newton's sauce.

456
00:55:56,800 --> 00:56:01,080
I think Kaal's powers are hidden
in the gems on his armor.

457
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:05,640
Zaalim Zalzala is here!

458
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:08,400
Now everyone will feel the brute!

459
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:14,280
No one can protect you.

460
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:25,240
Kaal army, attack!

461
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:32,160
Run. We'll handle the Kaal army.

462
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:10,320
Police uniform and the strength of a lion!

463
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:14,520
What? You still have your hopes high?

464
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:21,840
Police uniform and the strength of a lion!
He is Little Singham.

465
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:23,920
Louder.

466
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Police uniform and the strength of a lion!
He is Little Singham.

467
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,640
The mighty lion!

468
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:53,680
Little Singham is here.

469
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:00,160
The mighty lion!

470
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:03,000
The lion's roar!

471
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:08,240
Now there will be a fierce competition!

472
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:14,480
-This is not possible.
-How did this happen?

473
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:19,200
If you can't believe that I'm back,

474
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:22,520
then my claw attack will convince you.

475
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:35,400
Little Singham, you're back.

476
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:39,560
Little Singham, where did you go?

477
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:43,160
How are you, friends?
I hope you didn't miss me too much.

478
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:45,040
We missed you a lot, sir.

479
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:50,040
It's time to face Kaal.

480
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:02,000
And here is your ride.

481
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:09,560
-The Lionheart Flame says it aloud.
-Bravery shall win and evil shall lose.

482
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:16,880
Attack!

483
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:46,800
Hey, Kaal! I won't beat you so easily.

484
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:49,800
I will make you run, tire you,

485
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:53,680
and then I'll hunt you down
and beat you.

486
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:00,200
To beat Kaal, you'll have to get to Kaal.

487
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:04,680
Revenge! Revenge! Revenge!

488
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:08,120
Revenge! Revenge! Revenge!

489
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:10,280
Revenge! Revenge! Revenge!

490
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:13,640
Revenge! Revenge! Revenge!

491
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:16,360
I think the enemy is afraid
and has gone up.

492
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:18,280
Should we follow him, friends?

493
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:50,920
Take me to Little Singham.

494
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:58,720
You have to beat me first.

495
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:01,000
Whoever comes in our way...

496
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:03,560
Will be squashed.

497
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:08,720
Little Singham.

498
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:12,280
Oh, no!
Lionheart warriors, do something!

499
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:16,040
I will help Little Singham.

500
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:45,360
It's time to go home, Zaalim Zalzala.

501
01:02:56,320 --> 01:03:00,560
No!

502
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:14,480
Babli, pull the rope. Now!

503
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:35,720
Stop asking your friends for help, kid.

504
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:39,160
Come and fight me alone
if you have the guts.

505
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:41,280
Now this lion will fight alone.

506
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:42,920
The mighty lion!

507
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:55,280
Little Singham,
that was your last adventure.

508
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:58,000
Because after fighting me,

509
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:01,280
your legs will never be the same.

510
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:10,000
The countdown to your end
begins now, Kaal.

511
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:32,920
Claw attack!

512
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:46,000
It's impossible to defeat Kaal.

513
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:18,760
This time I'll send you to a place

514
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:22,360
from where your friends
can't bring you back.

515
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:29,720
I am gonna go crazy!

516
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:38,560
Police uniform and the strength of a lion!

517
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:43,520
He is little but second to none!
Attack! Attack! Claw attack!

518
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:46,680
He will end all crime!

519
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:51,440
Kaal Rakshas,
you shouldn't have attacked my friends.

520
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:54,960
Now, face the claw attack
for your mistake.

521
01:05:55,720 --> 01:06:00,720
Police uniform and the strength of a lion!
He is Little Singham

522
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:07,120
It's time to bid goodbye, Kaal.

523
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:10,040
Now I'll send you to the netherworld.

524
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,640
Claw attack!

525
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:49,560
Little Singham!

526
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:57,320
Little Singham! Little Singham!
Little Singham!

527
01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:02,880
Police uniform and the strength of a lion!
He is Little Singham!

528
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:08,280
Police uniform and the strength of a lion!
He is Little Singham!

529
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:19,240
Thanks, Chikki.

530
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:27,320
Police uniform and the strength of a lion!

531
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:31,040
The lion is back. Clap your hands.

532
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:41,600
Little Singham, you have saved
Mirchi Nagar and the world

533
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:44,200
from losing its prestige.

534
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:46,680
But I didn't do it alone this time.

535
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:48,760
We did it together.

536
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:50,280
Well said, sir.

537
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:53,200
Mirchi Nagar is a city of heroes.

538
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:55,880
That makes me a superhero too.

539
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:58,360
Like we have Iron Man,

540
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:02,080
I too am a policeman, with a baton.

541
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:08,520
So remember, friends.

542
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:11,120
When there is no hero around,

543
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:15,560
assume that you are the hero
in that day's story.

544
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:19,080
Wow, the lion has roared so well!
Great!

545
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:20,920
I am gonna go crazy!

546
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:26,240
Revenge! Revenge! Revenge!

547
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:29,200
Revenge! Revenge! Revenge!

548
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:32,000
I'm back for revenge

549
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:34,479
And to destroy you all

550
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:38,680
You will witness the wrath of Kaal

551
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:39,880
Revenge!

552
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:45,200
I haven't forgotten my old enemy

553
01:08:45,479 --> 01:08:50,640
You will pay
For what you've done to me

554
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:52,680
Revenge!

555
01:08:53,439 --> 01:08:58,600
You will not win this game
You will be in pain

556
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:01,760
I'm mighty, I'm the destroyer

557
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:06,960
I won't rest until I seek revenge!

558
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:09,439
Revenge!

559
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:13,439
Your hearts will pound
You will be out of breath

560
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:19,160
The worst hasn't come to you yet

561
01:09:21,399 --> 01:09:25,399
The revenge of Kaal!

562
01:09:25,479 --> 01:09:27,680
