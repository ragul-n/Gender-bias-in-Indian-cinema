Okay. Do this. Get me a

Here's your biscuit, sir.

Here's your egg.

Yes, sir. What can I get for you?

Do you have
'Khichda' (Lentil pudding)?

Yes, we do, sir. But after 7:00.

Get me a plate of Haleem.

You'll get that as well,

Then get me paya Masala.

23
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,303
Sir, we had it, but we ran out
of paya Masala. It's over.

24
00:01:49,642 --> 00:01:51,132
Then, sir, tell me,
what should I have?

25
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:52,269
Why don't you have
'Misal pav' (lndian dish), sir?

26
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:53,403
It's very good, sir.

27
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,175
It's just that we don't have
'Sev' (Snack) and cashews.

28
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:56,977
The rest is superb,
sir. I'll order it, okay?

29
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,449
Hey!
- One Misal pav, please.

30
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,323
Sorry. What else can I say?

31
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:09,588
But, Brother Firoz, we have
been working here since years.

32
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:13,393
And now.. - The lease taken
for 99 years has now ended.

33
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:14,990
That lousy landlord
has given its contract..

34
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:17,400
..to some Burger Hut guy.

35
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,404
We'll get a job at the
Burger Hut, right, sir?

36
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:20,996
What are you saying?

37
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:24,009
College kids work as
waiters at McDonald's..

38
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:26,545
..pizza hut, Cafe coffee day
and all these places nowadays.

39
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:29,275
Young and educated.
Which you aren't.

40
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:32,211
Mr. Jhamshed, Montu,
Babloo and Benny..

41
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:35,015
..now you'll have to
find some new job.

42
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:37,283
This Burger Hut has
ruined you. Now what to do?

43
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:39,621
What to do know? We'll run
after a job now. What else?

44
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:47,961
Darling, you
appear so parched today.

45
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:50,901
Don't worry. I
won't keep you thirsty.

46
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:55,973
My sweetheart, why
do you look so glum?

47
00:02:56,442 --> 00:03:00,037
This Babloo of yours quenches
thirst. The rest is nonsense.

48
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:02,980
Babloo. Babloo.
Actually.. Babloo!! - What?

49
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:09,521
Babloo!! - What?

50
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:11,386
Have some sweets first.

51
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:13,253
One more. Come on.

52
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:15,988
Now ask me what happened.

53
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:17,051
What happened?

54
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,191
Welcome to the proud family of the
Mirage Group of Hotels, Mr. Benny.

55
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:23,593
This is your appointment letter.

56
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:25,595
We're delighted to
have you as the bell boy.

57
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:29,006
You've got a job in a five
star hotel. Mind blowing.

58
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:32,202
You know uncle Dalmiya, don't you?

59
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:33,336
I met him at the lrani
hotel yesterday. - Yes.

60
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:35,608
I buttered him up every day.

61
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:37,013
I requested him to
get me a job. - Okay.

62
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,345
And he recommended me.

63
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:40,010
And this Benny knows English.

64
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:41,417
I know a little bit, right?
A little bit

65
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:42,545
Yes. A little bit.

66
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:44,146
"How are you?" and all that.

67
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,093
Babloo, I'm on my way. - Yes.

68
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:51,621
Okay, listen. You had
been to find a job, right?

69
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:54,633
What happened? Tell me. Tell me.

70
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:56,293
I've also got a job.

71
00:03:57,103 --> 00:03:58,968
Ghungroo. Ladies bar.

72
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,974
You'll work as a
waiter here from today.

73
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:04,236
Okay.

74
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,572
Come on, go. Be here
on time from tomorrow.

75
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:08,239
Sir, I'll be here half an
hour before time. - Why?

76
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:12,113
Will you flirt with my
bar girls for half an hour?

77
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:13,243
No. No, sir.

78
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,387
Babloo, if you try to get
cosy with a girl here.. - Yes.

79
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:21,922
Then I'll chop off your
legs first. Then your thighs.

80
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:24,054
And then your..

81
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,257
What?
- Yes. That as well.

82
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:27,657
I did not mean that.

83
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:28,996
Are you going to
work in a ladies bar?

84
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:31,002
Very indecent place, pal.
- I'll not get a job anywhere.

85
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:34,005
And I can't even speak
broken English like you.

86
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:36,007
Your family is there in..
- Darbanga.

87
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:37,133
In Darbanga, your district.

88
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,472
If your family comes to know
that you work in a ladies bar..

89
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:39,670
..they'll die of shame.

90
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:42,476
But if I don't work at all, they'll
die of hunger. What are you saying!

91
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,015
He's tarnishing his parents' name.

92
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:46,142
You mind it. I'm telling you.

93
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:47,880
So do you want me to let
my parents starve to death?

94
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,353
"Benny is a bad boy."

95
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:02,957
Good day, sir.

96
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:07,434
I see. What are you saying, sir?

97
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:08,974
You fool.

98
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:10,100
Haven't you ever
seen a mirror before?

99
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:11,165
How long are you
going to behold yourself?

100
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:15,981
Ronnie, I have worn such
nice clothes for..

101
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:17,038
..the first time in my life.

102
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:20,311
What nice? It's the uniform.
It's a regular thing.

103
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:23,116
Yes, it might be 'legular'..
regular for you. - Yes.

104
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,316
You are the senior
bell boy, aren't you?

105
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:29,387
Till now, I've seen a five star
hotel only through a passing by bus.

106
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,988
For the first time,
I'll see a bus go by..

107
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:34,931
..standing in a five star hotel.

108
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:39,127
I'm very lucky. I'm so.. I'm..

109
00:05:39,205 --> 00:05:40,399
Are you going to beat me up?

110
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:44,268
Listen. Forget your emotion.
And enjoy your promotion.

111
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,070
Let's go. Come on.

112
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:50,544
What a fitting!

113
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,151
Why are you cribbing
about the fitting?

114
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:58,957
Sir, isn't this a little too long.

115
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,083
prakash was also tall.

116
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,349
prakash who?

117
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:03,961
The one whose coat this is.

118
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,225
What will prakash
wear if I wear his coat?

119
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:08,096
A shroud. - What?
- He is dead.

120
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:10,364
He had a tumour in his brain.

121
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:13,171
Listen, is there some any..

122
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:15,901
No. No, you don't have
a brain to begin with.

123
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:21,104
Here. pen and.. order slip.
And start work quickly.

124
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:22,971
We can take care of
the fitting later.

125
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:30,519
This coat of a dead man?

126
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:34,448
The banquet hall should be..

127
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,122
Negi. Manager.

128
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:41,193
Hey, you, come here. Come here.
- He's calling you.

129
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:42,996
Nikhil, why do we need
to pay him extra? I..

130
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:45,197
Good night to you, sir.
- What?

131
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:47,072
Good morning is..
- Shut up.

132
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,402
What, sir? - Not to you.
Just hold on for a second.

133
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,133
Who are you?

134
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:52,006
I'm the bell.
- Bell?

135
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,069
The.. I.. Benny the bell boy.

136
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:55,878
Aren't you a little too tall?

137
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:58,006
You start, but you never end.

138
00:06:58,484 --> 00:06:59,542
Come on, go back to your place.

139
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:00,608
Hurry up. Come on.

140
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:02,079
Tukaram, come here. - Yes, sir.

141
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:04,089
Tukaram, go to Nikhil.
- Okay, sir. - Okay?

142
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:05,548
Nikhil, listen to me now.

143
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:07,554
Now come on. Don't look at my face.

144
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:08,958
Move it. Disperse. Come on.

145
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:10,086
Get back to work.

146
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:11,289
Nikhil, listen to me.
- Yes, sir.

147
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:13,226
I.. I'm going, sir.

148
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,965
Hey! What are you doing,
for God's sake?

149
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:17,093
What are you doing?

150
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,228
Sir. Sorry, sir. Sorry, sir.

151
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:19,362
Take this man. He's at it again.

152
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,497
I'll get him. I'll
get him. - Sorry, sir.

153
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:22,302
And check the arrangements
of the exhibition. Come on.

154
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,203
"Benny.. Benny..
Benny, the bad boy."

155
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:58,072
"Benny.. Benny..
Benny, the bad boy."

156
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,285
"Benny.. Benny..
Benny, the bad boy."

157
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:24,298
'Welcome to hotel Mirage.'

158
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:34,973
'Welcome to hotel Mirage.'

159
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:37,311
Good evening, sir. Good evening.
Good evening, ma'am. - Good evening.

160
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,246
Benny, what are you doing?

161
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:44,380
Do you want to break it?

162
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:45,389
Look. This..

163
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:49,327
Come on. Come on.

00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:51,318
Get the bags now.

165
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:53,592
Bell boy.. - Yes, sir.

166
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:04,937
Benny. Benny, what are you doing?

00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:06,069

168
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:07,535

169
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:09,939
What are you doing? Hold on. Watch.

170
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:15,019
This.. And this. Here. Hold it.

171

Hold it. Come on.

172
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:20,614
Excuse me?
- Yes, sir.

173
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,025
Good evening, ma'am.

174
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:25,085
Welcome to our hotel.

175
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,360
Oh, yes. Of course.

176
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:30,424
This way, please.

177
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,505
This is ma'am Sheena.
The pRO of this place.

178
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:35,367
public relations officer.

179
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:37,568
Does Sheena ma'am
know Chinese as well?

180
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:38,632
Very good.

181
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:40,969
All the people who work
in this hotel..

182
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:42,105
..know Chinese, Japanese, Korean..

183
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:43,239
..everything.

184
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:44,374
Don't worry. You'll
learn it very soon.

185
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:47,385
I.. I can't even
speak Hindi properly.

186
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:49,045
I get mixed up with the
masculine and feminine gender.

187
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:51,112
Really? Come on. I'll
teach you Chinese. Come on.

188
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:08,997
Sir, you can't roam around
in the passage like this.

189
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,469
This is a five star, you know.

190
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:12,135
I know. I know. What can I do?

191
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:14,145
I came here to keep this tray.
And this door just shut by itself.

192
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:16,072
What are you doing?

193
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:17,342
Get a duplicate key
and open this door.

194
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,951
Oh, God.- Good evening, sir.
Good evening, ma'am.

195
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:25,214
Oh, God.
- Benny, what are you doing?

196
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:28,092
Come on. This not a tiger.
It's a door. Come on.

197
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:48,173
She is the head of
our housekeeping. Ria.

198
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:50,912
Who was behind her?
- Guest.

199
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:52,373
He must have messed up something.

200
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:58,112
Come, sir.

201
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:05,129
Sir, over here is
your bathroom, sir.

202
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:06,391
And there is a very
beautiful balcony outside..

203
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:07,659
..with a very wonderful..

204
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:08,927
Oh, my God.

205
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,064
Sir, the house-keeping will come..

206
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:16,335
..and give you
fresh towel right now.

207
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:17,665
Yes, sir.

208
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,068
Good day, sir.
- Good day.

209
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:20,134
Good day, sir.

210
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:23,946
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

211
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:25,342
Benny, good day, sir.

212
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:28,151
Good day, sir.
- Good day.. sir.

213
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:31,017
Good day, sir. Good day.
- Good day.

214
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:33,280
Good day, ma'am.

215
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,166
So? Now you learnt Chinese,
didn't you?

216
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,491
Look, mister, this is
the hospitality industry.

217
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:44,627
This is how it works here.

218
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:45,966
The person before us can
say whatever he wants.

219
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,437
We just have to smile.

220
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:48,905
Everyone does the same here.

221
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:52,505
Be it if the person before us is
abusing our mother in his language.

222
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:55,046
But we just have to smile and say..

223
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:57,173
.."Thank you, thank you, sir.
Shoot me, sir. Thank you, sir".

224
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,515
I.. I can't believe it, Ronnie.

225
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:00,916
Rs. 100, buddy.

226
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:04,384
I love.. this.. hospital..
- Hospitality industry. - Yes.

227
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:26,409
That guest has ruined my
life by calling me and again.

228
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:27,673
Last night a fool had come.
- Yes, pal.

229
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,009
He made me sing the
same song five times.

230
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,015
What nonsense! I went crazy singing.

231
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,141
I can' believe these
idiots who come here.

232
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:33,276
Look here.

233
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:34,944
Ladies, this is Babloo.
- Hello.

234
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:37,351
He'll be working in
our bar from today.

235
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:43,024
Welcome. We were.. waiting for you.
- Waiting for you.

236
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:46,355
Hey, I'll call you Babloo,
the smarty.

237
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,423
No. My name is Babloo Charan Lathi.

238
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:50,026
Really?

239
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:53,299
Hey, you are Babloo?
- Yes.

240
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:54,566
What do you want to
be when you grow up?

241
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,629
Babloo.

242
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:01,112
You wretch!

243
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,171
You were wooing my man
on the phone, weren't you?

244
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:04,978
Listen, smart alec, don't
vent out your frustration..

245
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:07,109
..on me because he
doesn't give you attention.

246
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:08,244
Go away. - What?

247
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,982
You wretch, a loose
character of the ladies bar.

248
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:12,387
So are you the bell of a temple?

249
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,516
And you are characterless.

250
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:14,650
Look, they are fighting so badly.

251
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:16,991
This happens here everyday. You
don't get into all this. - Hello.

252
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:18,120
You look at yourself in the mirror.

253
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:19,255
Don't spoil my mood or I'll
whack you. - Yes, tell me.

254
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:20,992
And I'll just stand here and smile?
- You talk nonsense..

255
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:22,397
Come on, get lost.
- Shut up.

256
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,333
Look, Sisters, calm down.

257
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,200
What did you say?

258
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:33,074
Sister. Why? What happened?

259
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:36,012
You naive Babloo. "Witch"
"wretch", "insolent" is..

260
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:37,480
..the local dialect here.

261
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:40,008
Don't call us sister.
It seems like an abuse.

262
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:44,353
Witch, wretch, insolent, keep calm.

263
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:49,959
"Sweetheart, oh, sweetheart, say.."

264
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:54,298
"Oh, please open your heart to me."

265
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:58,632
How was your first day?
- Superb. Fantastic.

266
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:01,365
It is not a hotel. It's heaven.

267
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,101
I was dumbfounded when l
went there for the first time.

268
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:07,503
And you don't know. The boys and
girls there look like movie stars.

269
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,638
They are no less.

270
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:10,978
And ladies. How they
look in the TV soaps?

271
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:13,450
With the dots, lipstick and stuff.
All decked up. Like that.

272
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:16,053
And the work there, Babloo.

273
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:17,110
You just have to carry the luggage.

274
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:19,055
And you don't have
to carry that either.

275
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:20,591
There is a roll..

276
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:21,990
Roller.
- Yes.

277
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:23,528
You just have to hold the
roller and pull it along.

278
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:24,654
Move it. Keep it in the room.

279
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,664
Then be it Chinese, lndian. Anyone.

280
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:28,666
You say to him, "Good day, sir".

281
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:30,065
"Good day, ma'am".

282
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:31,193
Then..

283
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:35,398
You get this tip, Babloo.

284
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:36,998
The 'pulao' (Rice Dish) is
getting burnt. Take it off. Come on.

285
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:39,201
Take it off. Quickly.

286
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:44,942
"Sweetheart, oh,
sweetheart, say something."

287
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:46,143
It was your first day, right?

288
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:48,277
How was it?

289
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:50,219
You smart elec. Tell me.

290
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:51,278
Tell me what happened.

291
00:14:51,957 --> 00:14:54,016
There is nothing dream-like there.

292
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:59,087
There is only the reality of life.

293
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:03,901
'Benny, these guys
also worship the God.'

294
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:07,101
'The only difference is that
people do it early morning.'

295
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:09,106
'And these guys do
it in the evenings.'

296
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:11,039
"ln this love of two days.."

297
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:16,175
'By 9:!30 when the guests
start arriving in the bar..'

298
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:19,450
"ln this love of two days.."

299
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:22,976
Then the girls come onto the
floor from the make up room.

300
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:25,523
"They have started saying to me."

301
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:26,990
"Ever since I have lost my heart.."

302
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:30,187
"..I've got more
than I bargained for."

303
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:31,991
"Ever since I have lost my heart.."

304
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:34,999
"..I've got more
than I bargained for."

305
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:47,269
"He is admirer. His charm."

306
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:50,144
Richa, don't give
him attention, okay?

307
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:53,275
Can't you see? It's written on
his face that, "I'm a loser".

308
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:57,211
He's a guest who'll only
show the money and not spend it.

309
00:15:58,157 --> 00:15:59,146
Find someone else.

310
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,219
My request? Go.

311
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:05,285
Request.

312
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:07,963
"The first love.."

313
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:10,360
Roshni, your man has sent a request.

314
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:12,370
"The heart's restless.
The spring's here."

315
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:15,635
Tell that loser to
get a wad of notes out.

316
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,505
Or else others are ready.

317
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:19,968
"Ever since I have lost my heart.."

318
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:23,105
"..I've got more
than I bargained for."

319
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:24,979
"Ever since I have lost my heart.."

320
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,984
"..I've got more
than I bargained for."

321
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:30,988
What's your name?
- Soni. - What? - Soni.

322
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:34,048
Soni, no one's like you.

323
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:39,928
Give me your number.

324
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:42,991
You give me your number.
I'll give you a call.

325
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:44,126
For sure.

326
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:47,195
Soni keeps playing the
rapid fire round all the time.

327
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:50,007
One day such a buzzer will go off..

328
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:52,543
..that she'll left at
home watching Sony TV.

329
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,349
What time will you call?

330
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:02,284
After I wake up at 4:00.

331
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:07,087
"l also got excited and said.."

332
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:10,955
"He started saying in the
first meeting at night."

333
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:15,023
"Come, let me adorn
you with some jewelery."

334
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,965
"Ever since I have lost my heart.."

335
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,095
"..I've got more
than I bargained for."

336
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:20,968
"Ever since I have lost my heart.."

337
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,166
"..I've got more
than I bargained for."

338
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:26,302
Here comes the fool. Lousy loser.

339
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:33,110
pathetic idiot.

340
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:37,451
So? Bills of ten?

341
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:38,922
Did you break your piggy bank today?

342
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,183
Give me your number.

343
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,386
Why Harry potter?

344
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:44,053
Are you a part of the
dowry my father gave?

345
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:46,587
No. Well, the thing is
that we'll meet somewhere.

346
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:49,395
We'll go to some disco
and the dance as well.

347
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:51,197
I don't dance with children.

348
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,328
With children?

349
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:54,200
Are you pregnant?

350
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:56,207
This fool..

351
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:58,271
Come on, drink.

352
00:17:58,343 --> 00:17:59,332
Come on.

353
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:06,144
Hey, listen.
- Yes.

354
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:09,477
Give me the number.
- Sir, I don't have a mobile.

355
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:11,420
You fool. Not yours.

356
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:14,356
Give me the number of
that girl in purple.

357
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,291
"ln the first meeting.."

358
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:18,158
I don't have her number.

359
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,288
"He started saying in the
first meeting at night."

360
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:22,424
"Come, let me adorn
you with some jewelery."

361
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:23,968
"Ever since I have lost my heart.."

362
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:26,436
"..I've got more
than I bargained for."

363
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:28,905
Hey!
- Sorry.

364
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:34,503
Sir, I'll replace it.

365
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,569
Sir, I'll replace it.

366
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:37,640
What happened?

367
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:40,241
Well, what do I tell you?
I got nervous and spilt it.

368
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:41,377
Get me another one.

369
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:42,579
You're such an idiot. - please.

370
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:45,251
Hey, loser. Come here.

371
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:47,053
"With you I have.."

372
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,184
What was that fool saying?

373
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,386
"Ever since I have lost my heart.."

374
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:50,860
He was asking for your number?

375
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,188
You gave him, right?

376
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:54,596
No. I don't have your number.

377
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:55,860
I wouldn't have given
him even if I had it.

378
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:58,536
So will you give my number to
Shah Rukh Khan (lndian actor)?

379
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:03,530
Here you go.

380
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,014
Well done, my little friend. - Yes.

381
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:11,879
You've got the number?
- Yes. Yes.

382
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:16,147
Rs. 500. Have fun.

383
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:21,084
He gave you a Rs. 500 tip?
- Good tip, isn't it?

384
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,559
Very good, Babloo.

385
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:24,027
Wonderful.

386
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:26,560
Well, the result of
every bad deed is good.

387
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,155
Bad?

388
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:30,101
Not like that.

389
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,431
Now I'm your friend.
That's why I'm telling you.

390
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,437
The thing is that you've become a
supplier in the form of a waiter.

391
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,439
No. But I didn't supply any girl.

392
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,975
Not.. Not a girl. The thing is
that you supplied the number, right?

393
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:40,170
That's why I said that.

394
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:41,303
Very good.

395
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,369
Rs. 500 tip. It's very good.

396
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:44,909
Tell me something.

397
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:46,978
How many girls work in your bar?

398
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:48,580
Must be around 12-15.

399
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:50,443
So many of them? - Yes.

400
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:55,986
So.. if you give 10 or
15 numbers every day..

401
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:58,996
..as in supply them..
three years down the line..

402
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:00,929
..you'll open your own beer bar.

403
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:04,991
Then people will say, "Hello,
Brother Babloo. How are you?"

404
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:08,402
I was only doing my duty sincerely.
That's all.

405
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:11,135
That's fine. Sincerity
and stuff. That's okay.

406
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:16,603
What?

407
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:18,949
Oh, you heard that?

408
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:21,076
What were you saying?

409
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:23,018
It's.. How do I say it in Hindi?

410
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,022
It doesn't work if you spread
out the blanket of honesty..

411
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,354
..on the bed of dishonesty.

412
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:29,417
This is what Rajnikanth
(lndian actor) had said in a movie.

413
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:30,688
That's why I also just said it.

414
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:31,956
Okay. Good night.

415
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:34,496
That Rs. 500 tip. Very good.

416
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:48,510
Mr. Shahnawaaz, agreed
that you live in Surat.

417
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,980
But at times, show
us your face as well.

418
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:53,313
Hello. Hello.

419
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,448
No. No. Tell me.

420
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:59,251
Have you also bought off this
elevator along with your customers?

421
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:01,315
You've spoilt the
environment of the entire building.

422
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:03,987
Hey, hello. If you have bought a
flat in Lokhandwala with money..

423
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:06,530
..even I haven't
bought it with iron. Okay?

424
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,996
And what I do is
my personal problem.

425
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:10,466
Okay? - personal?

426
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:13,197
public property
talking about being personal?

427
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,069
Hello. Excuse me.

428
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,131
Ria, stop it. Forget it.

429
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:19,934
And, dear, don't take
offence either. please.

430
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:23,410
Go. You're in a hurry,
right? Go. Go.

431
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,012
Sorry, dear. - Aunty, please.

432
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:29,411
This is madam's car.

433
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:32,485
I wonder how many people she
must have ruined to get this car.

434
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:34,615
And this is the managing
committee of this place.

435
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:37,222
They won't take any step.

436
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,285
And why would they?

437
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:40,089
Because she must be
doing a complimentary show..

438
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:42,099
..for them along with
paying the maintenance.

439
00:21:43,168 --> 00:21:44,965
Mom, how does it
matter to these girls..

440
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:47,301
..if it's an old or a young man?

441
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:48,361
Forget it, Ria.

442
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,164
Why are you spoiling your mood?

443
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,443
Go to work in a good mood.

444
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:59,911
First you waited for the elevator.
Now for the bus?

445
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:01,174
You're getting late, aren't you?

446
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:02,920
You want a ride, baby?

447
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:05,917
Get lost, monkey face.

448
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,004
Hey, Sheena.

449
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:24,201
You are still at home?

450
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:25,334
Look, what I got here.

451
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:26,604
City club membership form.

452
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:28,541
It's an amazing scheme.

453
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:32,071
A tour package of five nights
and four nights every three months.

454
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:34,146
And this is even more amazing.

455
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:37,019
They have recorded all
their locations on this DVD.

456
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:38,215
Let's watch and book it. Come.

457
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,019
Ashu, you show up with
some or the other holiday..

458
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:42,083
..scheme every other day.

459
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,149
But what happens?

460
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:44,622
You had got one last
time as well, hadn't you?

461
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:48,223
We work day and night to pay
for the instalments of the same.

462
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,491
You work in the day shift,
while I work in the night shift.

463
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:52,969
When one of us returns,
the other prepares to leave.

464
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,233
Listen. Look.. Look, sweetheart.

465
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,971
You'll have to make some
adjustments to lead..

466
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,305
..a lavish life like this.

467
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,039
What life are you
talking about, Ashu?

468
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:02,171
Where is our life?

469
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:03,578
Life is when you stay together.

470
00:23:03,648 --> 00:23:04,979
By starting a family.

471
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,314
We have no family. We have no life.

472
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,644
Can't you see? You've just returned.

473
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:10,915
And I'm preparing to leave.

474
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:12,178
But listen.

475
00:23:13,191 --> 00:23:14,988
At least watch the
DVD before you go.

476
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:32,067
Oh, no.

477
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:34,078
What is this, ma'am?
Can't you drive carefully?

478
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:35,204
I'm sorry.
- What sorry?

479
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,338
I could've died. You have
brought about an accident.

480
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:37,473
Are you okay?

481
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:38,607
I mean are you..

482
00:23:38,683 --> 00:23:40,344
Yes. What "Are you okay"?
- Is this a way to drive?

483
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,353
What is this, ma'am? You have
brought about an accident, right?

484
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:43,479
What if I had died?
- I apologized to you.

485
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:44,613
I'll take you to
the hospital, right?

486
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:45,621
Brother.. Brother, what happened?

487
00:23:45,957 --> 00:23:47,219
Brother, she would've
ran me down and killed me.

488
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:48,953
But you are okay, aren't you?

489
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:50,085
Who are you? What it is to you?

490
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:51,356
I'm Benny, the
bell boy. Who are you?

491
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,159
Mind it. Go.

492
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:56,156
Move. Move.

493
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:59,297
You okay?
- Yes. Yes, I'm fine.

494
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:00,960
Thank you.

495
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:05,566
Ma'am, you did not recognize me?
- No.

496
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:06,906
Benny, the bell boy in Mirage Hotel.

497
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:09,974
I see. Are you a new recruit?
- Yes.

498
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:11,440
I was heading to work.

499
00:24:11,516 --> 00:24:13,108
I live close by. You
see this building.

500
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:14,243
In this?

501
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:15,980
No. Behind this. If you go
straight and then straight again..

502
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:17,453
..there is a tenement. I live there.

503
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:19,183
Come, I'll give you a ride.

504
00:24:21,593 --> 00:24:22,582
Thank you, ma'am.

505
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:25,991
Sit in front. Not at the back.

506
00:24:26,064 --> 00:24:27,929
I would look like your
driver if you sit at the back.

507
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:32,193
What happened? Why are you laughing?

508
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:35,000
No, ma'am. Well.. I was wondering..
I look like a driver..

509
00:24:35,073 --> 00:24:38,065
..even if I sit in the front.

510
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:40,602
The thing is that people will feel..

511
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:42,670
..that madam has made
the driver sit beside her..

512
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:44,009
..and is driving the car herself.

513
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:46,411
Why? Why are you saying so?

514
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,419
Just like that,
ma'am. You're after all.

515
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:51,480
You are like
twinkle-twinkle five star.

516
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:57,090
Ma'am, you should laugh
your heart out like this.

517
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:58,151
You look more beautiful that way.

518
00:24:58,563 --> 00:24:59,621
Beautiful?

519
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:02,963
No. I mean the face
appears brighter, ma'am.

520
00:25:03,034 --> 00:25:04,023
Very nice.

521
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:08,303
Really? Then I must be
looking really bad when at home.

522
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:10,100
At home? Why, ma'am?

523
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,099
Forget it.

524
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:15,579
Tell me, how it
feels working at Mirage?

525
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:17,911
In Mirage, ma'am.

526
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:20,379
On the first day, I jumped.

527
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:21,441
I was jumping.

528
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,246
I'm very lucky, ma'am.

529
00:25:23,321 --> 00:25:24,982
I must have earned
some sins, virtues..

530
00:25:25,056 --> 00:25:26,648
I mean virtues in my previous birth.

531
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:28,989
That's why I'm working at Mirage.

532
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,187
That guy.. that fellow at Mirage..

533
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:47,138
When I got down from ma'am
Sheena's car, that Ronnie..

534
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:49,942
You should've seen Ronnie's face.

535
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:51,277
It was as red as a tomato.

536
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,949
He is nice guy. But he got jealous.

537
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:55,948
Babloo, the thing is
that ma'am Sheena..

538
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:58,546
..will be offering
me a ride every day.

539
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,282
That's great.

540
00:26:00,358 --> 00:26:01,416
What great? You've lost.

541
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:04,284
What the..

542
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,221
"Don't look at the face."

543
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:09,290
Don't sing the song
of 1990. This is 2010.

544
00:26:09,367 --> 00:26:12,165
Benny, this song
created quite a storm.

545
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,295
What are you saying?

546
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,096
What storm would be
created in your ladies bar?

547
00:26:15,173 --> 00:26:16,970
All this happens 'legularly'..

548
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:19,243
Regularly? - Yes.
Everything happens there regularly.

549
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:20,300
What are you saying?

550
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:25,973
"Get into my heart
and see for yourself."

551
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:27,177
What happened in the bar?

552
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,049
A customer frequents our bar.

553
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,314
Ripe oldie.

554
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:31,377
Bokadia.

555
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,325
Here's your hero.

556
00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:42,394
"Don't look at the face."

557
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:46,864
"Get into my heart
and see for yourself."

558
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:49,933
"Get into my heart
and see for yourself."

559
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:51,270
This oldie?

560
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:55,404
"Don't look at the face."

561
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,005
Your admirer is
heading for your waist.

562
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:01,075
"Get into my heart
and see for yourself."

563
00:27:01,152 --> 00:27:02,949
Isha, go tell him that
this is not the age..

564
00:27:03,021 --> 00:27:04,613
..to head for someone's waist..

565
00:27:04,689 --> 00:27:05,951
..but towards the grave.

566
00:27:06,024 --> 00:27:07,992
"See for yourself."

567
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:12,956
"The weather will
change in a flash."

568
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:16,228
"Even the heart of stone will melt."

569
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,030
Today the oldie is all charged up.

570
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:20,561
Today, old is gold.

571
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:26,373
"Just see for yourself
how effective my love is."

572
00:27:26,444 --> 00:27:27,570
Uncle is an absolute lover boy.

573
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:31,377
"See for yourself."

574
00:27:31,449 --> 00:27:33,440
Someone please give Viagra to uncle.

575
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,245
Along with the wood for the funeral.

576
00:27:36,521 --> 00:27:37,579
Lousy guy.

577
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:40,989
"Get into my heart
and see for yourself."

578
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:45,052
"Get into my heart
and see for yourself."

579
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:47,928
Babloo, don't ever fall in love.

580
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:50,058
"The weather will
change in a flash."

581
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:51,932
"Even the heart of stone will melt."

582
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:56,337
But if you do, then
don't ever back off.

583
00:27:57,609 --> 00:28:01,477
"Grey hair and unsure gait.
- Grey hair and unsure gait."

584
00:28:01,546 --> 00:28:04,947
"She is now defamed.
She has found an oldie."

585
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:06,540
"She has found an oldie."

586
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:10,081
It's not right to make fun of
someone in out of tune voice.

587
00:28:10,488 --> 00:28:11,614
Believe me.

588
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:15,421
I can clearly see love for
you in Mr. Bokadia's eyes.

589
00:28:19,564 --> 00:28:20,963
She will not change.

590
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:23,432
Babloo, you've started
preaching a lot these days.

591
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:28,231
Look at uncle's true love.
He is almost in the grave.

592
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:30,641
She can say whatever she
wants to. I'm telling the truth.

593
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:33,644
Babloo, that oldie can't see
anything properly with his own eyes.

594
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:34,974
How did you mange to see love?

595
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:36,104
Because he loves you, madam.

596
00:28:36,181 --> 00:28:37,239
It is true love.

597
00:28:37,315 --> 00:28:38,976
Let that oldie be.

598
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,041
Look, Soni, Babloo is right.

599
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:42,245
So what if he is old?

600
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,914
He doesn't just want to
sleep with you like the others.

601
00:28:45,256 --> 00:28:50,193
Yes. The rest of the boys just
want to have fun. - Exactly.

602
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:51,990
Isn't it?

603
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:53,997
Yes. One night stand and all.

604
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:55,054
Are you done with the preaching?

605
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:58,402
Soni, you'll come
across many admirers.

606
00:28:59,003 --> 00:29:01,597
But you won't find anyone
who absolutely adores you.

607
00:29:04,275 --> 00:29:07,267
Yes. She will get someone.
Someone who adores her.

608
00:29:07,545 --> 00:29:08,534
Do you know what kind of people?

609
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:11,410
These pickpockets, thugs, thieves..

610
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:13,075
These goons..

611
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:14,476
They'll get people like them.

612
00:29:14,552 --> 00:29:15,610
How can they even think that..

613
00:29:15,687 --> 00:29:17,348
..they can actually get
someone who loves them?

614
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,151
How can you say that?

615
00:29:19,224 --> 00:29:20,486
Love is blind, isn't it?

616
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:22,558
Look, I don't know
about love and stuff.

617
00:29:22,627 --> 00:29:24,288
You're getting blinded by emotions.
I'm dead sure.

618
00:29:26,164 --> 00:29:27,563
This place is not
right for you, Babloo.

619
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:29,360
I'll speak to ma'am Sheena..

620
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,026
..and get you a job
in our Mirage Hotel.

621
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,028
Till then, pull yourself together.

622
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:35,498
Don't get yourself into this
job of helping them settle down.

623
00:29:35,573 --> 00:29:36,562
Their lives will never change.

624
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:41,107
What about Mr. Mehra's four
sofas and teakwood wall unit?

625
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:42,578
Yes, sir. They will be
delivered by this evening.

626
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:44,376
"They will be
delivered by this evening".

627
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:46,981
If I ask you in the evening,
you would say by night.

628
00:29:47,051 --> 00:29:48,040
Then by the next morning.

629
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:51,379
Look, Salim, let me tell
you something clearly.

630
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:53,181
You have been appointed recently.

631
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:56,984
I hate carelessness and
slackness in work. Get that?

632
00:29:57,061 --> 00:29:58,323
Okay, sir.
- Shetty. - Yes, sir.

633
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:00,988
put our bean bags and
rocking chairs on display..

634
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:02,259
..along with Raju. - Okay, sir.

635
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:04,130
I have to teach them everything.

636
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:10,537
Hello? Yes. Yes. Yes,
it will be delivered.

637
00:30:10,608 --> 00:30:12,132
He is so perfect in his work.

638
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:13,268
But he is so strict.

639
00:30:13,678 --> 00:30:15,202
And he bullies us so much.

640
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,081
I guess his wife must not be
allowing him to speak at home.

641
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:19,616
That's why he vents out
his frustration on us.

642
00:30:19,684 --> 00:30:21,015
There is no one at his home.

643
00:30:21,085 --> 00:30:23,417
His kids and wife were
killed in an accident years ago.

644
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,012
What?

645
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:26,147
Yes. Such is life.

646
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:28,283
The one who is busy decorating..

647
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:29,417
..others' houses day and night..
Home sweet home.

648
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,018
He is all alone at his home.

649
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:45,308
"By signalling through my eyes.."

650
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:51,980
"..I will steal your heart."

651
00:30:54,719 --> 00:31:02,251
"By signalling through my eyes."

652
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:05,228
Oh, my, my! Superb.

653
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:11,201
"I'll steal.. your heart."

654
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:29,079
"By signalling through my eyes.."

655
00:31:29,153 --> 00:31:32,088
"..I'll steal your heart."

656
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:36,219
"By signalling through my eyes.."

657
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:39,525
"..I'll steal your heart."

658
00:31:39,597 --> 00:31:43,124
"Why don't you understand me?"

659
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:46,637
"Why don't you understand me?"

660
00:31:46,704 --> 00:31:50,470
"Why do you turn away
your face and abuse me?"

661
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:52,031
"Oh, Dolly."

662
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,299
"I'm Dolly."

663
00:31:54,445 --> 00:31:56,970
"Darling, I am your Dolly."

664
00:31:57,048 --> 00:32:00,415
"I'm Dolly. I'm Dolly.
I'm Dolly. I'm Dolly."

665
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:03,386
"I'm Dolly. I'm Dolly. I'm Dolly.
I'm Dolly, darling."

666
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:19,261
"Wow. What a magic! What style!"

667
00:32:19,737 --> 00:32:23,036
"The youthful style is mesmerising."

668
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:26,937
"Wow. What magic! What style!"

669
00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:33,943
"The youthful style is mesmerising."

670
00:32:34,218 --> 00:32:37,654
"What a tempting scene!"

671
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:44,958
"The ambience
searches raising glances."

672
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:51,996
"Why don't you understand me?"

673
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:55,562
"Why do you turn away
your face and abuse me?"

674
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,107
"Oh, Dolly."

675
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:00,206
"Darling, you are my Dolly."

676
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:04,977
"Oh, Dolly. My Dolly. Oh, Dolly."

677
00:33:12,056 --> 00:33:19,121
"Wherever I look, all my
admirers give me strange glances."

678
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:30,169
"Wherever I look, my
admirers give me strange glances."

679
00:33:30,241 --> 00:33:35,008
"Oh, beauty, listen
to me, oh, beauty.

680
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:37,411
Give me your heart by mistake."

681
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:44,449
"Why don't you understand me?"

682
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:47,980
"Why don't you understand me?"

683
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:51,961
"Why do you turn away
your face and abuse me?"

684
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,463
"Oh, Dolly."

685
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:54,555
"I'm Dolly."

686
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,100
"Darling, I am your Dolly."

687
00:33:58,169 --> 00:34:01,627
"I'm Dolly. I'm Dolly.
I'm Dolly. I'm Dolly."

688
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:03,435
"I'm Dolly. I'm Dolly.
I'm Dolly. I'm Dolly."

689
00:34:03,508 --> 00:34:05,032
Go in, lsha. Go quickly.
- Come on. Come on.

690
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:07,441
Hema, go in. Hurry up! Hurry up!
- Come on, hurry up. Run.

691
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:09,104
preeti, hurry up. Go quickly.
- Come on, hurry up. Let's go.

692
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:15,983
"By signalling through my eyes."

693
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,383
Open it. Hurry up.
- Open the door. - Hurry up, lsha.

694
00:34:19,457 --> 00:34:21,118
Open it quickly. - Come on,
make it fast. Come on.

695
00:34:21,192 --> 00:34:23,183
Come on, open it quickly.
Fast. - Come on, go fast. Quick.

696
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:24,421
Come on, hurry up.
Close it quickly.

697
00:34:38,009 --> 00:34:40,170
Mr. Kamble, there is no one here.

698
00:34:54,692 --> 00:34:55,886
Shall we go? - Yes.

699
00:34:57,161 --> 00:35:00,892
Hello? I'm hiding.
I'll call you later.

700
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:07,169
"Why do you turn away
your face and abuse me?"

701
00:35:07,972 --> 00:35:15,469
"Dolly. Darling, I'm your Dolly."

702
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:19,042
Scoundrel, it's Sunday morning
while celebrating Saturday night?

703
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:21,108
It's 1 :30. Do you know that?

704
00:35:21,185 --> 00:35:23,176
Sir.. I'm sorry..

705
00:35:23,554 --> 00:35:26,318
Were you still giving customer
service? - Yes, sir. Yes, sir..

706
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,285
How dare you break the law?

707
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:29,917
Mr. Kamble, let it be.

708
00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:32,927
Chiku, make
everyone's bill. Come on.

709
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,329
Sir, I'll get it
cleared in two minutes.

710
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:37,993
Hey, Brother.. - Come on,
everyone get up. Get up. Go.

711
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:41,300
Brother, we are just drinking
and not committing any crime.

712
00:35:41,372 --> 00:35:43,340
Do you have a permit to
sit and drink in a bar?

713
00:35:43,407 --> 00:35:45,068
Why do I need a permit, Brother?

714
00:35:45,676 --> 00:35:49,271
Dadav, arrest him. -
Come on. Come on. - Hey!

715
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:51,941
Hey? What are you doing? Let go of
my shirt, Brother. - Take him away.

716
00:35:54,018 --> 00:35:55,952
Come on, hurry up. Come on, Hema,
lsha, payal, Kalpana..

717
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,885
Come on, go from here quickly.

718
00:35:58,189 --> 00:35:59,952
Hurry up. - Let's go quickly.

719
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:01,480
Get out of here quickly.

720
00:36:01,959 --> 00:36:03,426
Come on, girls, hurry up.

721
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:04,483
Come quickly.

722
00:36:11,135 --> 00:36:12,500
Hurry up, Brother. Four Bunglows,
Mahadas road.

723
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:13,969
Hurry up. - You come here.

724
00:36:14,038 --> 00:36:15,369
Come on, hurry up. Hurry up.

725
00:36:18,276 --> 00:36:21,973
Benny, how will you earn
here without breaking the law?

726
00:36:22,246 --> 00:36:26,273
It is not allowed for the
girls to work here after 9:30pm.

727
00:36:27,985 --> 00:36:30,510
How many people enter
bars before 9:30 in Mumbai?

728
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:34,557
That, too, only four
girls are allowed.

729
00:36:36,327 --> 00:36:38,989
Not only these girls,
but many others..

730
00:36:39,063 --> 00:36:42,089
..earn a livelihood with
the help of this ladies bar.

731
00:36:43,067 --> 00:36:48,266
You know, like this waiter, this
Chotu, the watchman standing down..

732
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,869
..the rickshaw driver, the tailor,
that bangle vendor..

733
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,272
But who will explain it to them?

734
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,138
We run a small bar, don't we?

735
00:36:59,617 --> 00:37:02,211
The police has said the bar
has to shut down at 1 :30..

736
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:03,611
..and it's final.

737
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:06,953
But why do these policemen
harass the small bar owners?

738
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:09,456
Because they can't
enter the five star hotels.

739
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:12,185
'You are welcome to Hotel Mirage.'

740
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:24,039
This guy over here.. - Yes, sir.

741
00:37:24,108 --> 00:37:26,303
He is one of our
biggest clients. - Okay, sir.

742
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:29,505
All the seminars, conferences of
his company are held in our hotel.

743
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,639
Right, sir. - He is a very
important guest person. - Yes, sir.

744
00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:33,441
Good evening, sir.

745
00:37:33,517 --> 00:37:38,284
Sir, look at this. These are some
of the known actresses of Bollywood.

746
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:41,524
Their names and rates are
written in alphabetical order, sir.

747
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:44,525
You just point out anyone,
I'll organize it.

748
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:45,985
She'll be organized, sir.

749
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:50,992
Well.. this one. - Oh,
great choice. Great choice.

750
00:37:51,068 --> 00:37:52,535
Her horror film just released
with her being in the third lead.

751
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:53,592
She'll be organized.

752
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:58,537
Hey, look. A red handkerchief!

753
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:01,434
It means.. - Wow.

754
00:38:02,013 --> 00:38:05,574
Take service. Works
for me. What about you?

755
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:08,511
You are lucky. For me,
I'll check out.

756
00:38:20,698 --> 00:38:22,325
She has mind blowing figure,
right? - Yes.

757
00:38:23,668 --> 00:38:26,034
For your kind information,
let me tell you..

758
00:38:26,103 --> 00:38:30,039
..the girl by whom you are
impressed, is.. already married.

759
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:32,603
She is my wife.

760
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:38,081
She is hot, isn't she?
- No.. actually..

761
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:40,014
No? - Yes, I mean..

762
00:38:42,586 --> 00:38:45,487
Married? - Yes. There she is.

763
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:51,861
I see. You must be
having some business.

764
00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:54,231
Yes. We have three
showrooms of electronics in Mumbai.

765
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:58,294
Then you must always be
offering sales and all, right?

766
00:38:59,236 --> 00:39:00,533
The exchange offer schemes, right?

767
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:02,131
Yes, of course.

768
00:39:02,206 --> 00:39:03,935
You bring your old TV and
you'll get Rs. 15000 off..

769
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,566
..on the MRp of our
brand new plasma TV.

770
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:08,167
I'm not talking about the TV..

771
00:39:33,404 --> 00:39:34,462
Hey, baby. I'm telling you an
excellent story.

772
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:35,630
Just shut up. - ldiot.

773
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:37,632
Hey, sweetheart.

774
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:41,605
Hey, guys, hi. Hi. - Hello.
- Hi. - Hello, sir.

775
00:39:41,979 --> 00:39:43,947
Bye. - Good day.
Good day. Good day, sir.

776
00:40:24,522 --> 00:40:25,511
Come.

777
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,155
Hey, Ronnie. - Yes?

778
00:40:34,231 --> 00:40:36,096
Look, that boy who
got released.. Look.

779
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:39,692
He is a rich man's brat. He
was bound to get released.

780
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:42,195
He had just committed a
small crime, Benny. - What?

781
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:45,173
He just took some drugs and
shot two persons. That's it.

782
00:40:45,242 --> 00:40:46,641
Is it a small crime? - Yes.

783
00:40:46,977 --> 00:40:48,103
Where do you get these drugs?

784
00:40:49,013 --> 00:40:50,105
Benny, are you blind?

785
00:40:50,414 --> 00:40:52,575
You have not seen or
learned anything as yet.

786
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:54,641
All the drugs are sold
in that disco inside.

787
00:40:54,718 --> 00:40:57,278
There is less lights and
music and more drugs here.

788
00:40:58,155 --> 00:41:00,089
Drugs are sold in our hotel? - Yes.

789
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:01,585
Then why don't you
inform our manager?

790
00:41:02,092 --> 00:41:03,184
Do you think the manager
doesn't know about it?

791
00:41:04,161 --> 00:41:05,594
The manager knows
about it? - Of course.

792
00:41:05,996 --> 00:41:07,554
Then why doesn't he take any action?

793
00:41:08,098 --> 00:41:09,258
He should inform the police.

794
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:12,564
I'll tell you. Look, if no
drugs are supplied here.. - Yes?

795
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:15,334
Then who will come
to this disco? - What?

796
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:16,464
Everything is connected, Benny.

797
00:41:17,274 --> 00:41:19,936
They are concerned only with
their profit and nothing else.

798
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:25,447
Why are you so worried?

799
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:29,045
You didn't eat food either.
I think you have acidity.

800
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:30,108
Here, have this medicine.

801
00:41:30,688 --> 00:41:32,246
What is it? - Medicine.

802
00:41:33,023 --> 00:41:36,356
Oh, I thought it is sweets, you
are distributing them, right? - Okay.

803
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:38,554
I'll go to sleep when l
feel like it. - Yes, I know.

804
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:45,962
This is the red oil. It's very
cool and soothing.

805
00:41:46,036 --> 00:41:47,094
Apply it before you go to sleep..

806
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:49,537
..it will give a cooling effect.

807
00:41:52,142 --> 00:41:53,439
Why are you in my face?

808
00:41:54,144 --> 00:41:55,168
Will you let me sleep?

809
00:41:57,581 --> 00:41:58,570
Thanks a lot.

810
00:42:00,718 --> 00:42:04,484
please light the mosquito coil as
well. Okay? - Yes, I'll do that.

811
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:07,154
Oh, God.

812
00:42:07,224 --> 00:42:08,987
'Look, the justice of
our country is bizarre.'

813
00:42:10,394 --> 00:42:13,192
'The people create havoc
if a man cuts down a tree.'

814
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:16,324
'lf you kill a dog or an animal,
people create chaos.'

815
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,267
'But no one is bothered if
a man commits a suicide.'

816
00:42:19,336 --> 00:42:21,566
'No farmer will commit
a suicide from today.'

817
00:42:22,072 --> 00:42:25,269
'And if he does, God, forgive me.

818
00:42:25,342 --> 00:42:27,606
'I'd feel that I'm
failing in performing my duty.'

819
00:42:27,678 --> 00:42:28,736
Very good, sir.

820
00:42:28,812 --> 00:42:30,006
'l, Ramesh Thakur, in a conversation
with Rajnath Gaikwad..'

821

'Drugs are no less than a
dangerous spreading virus..'

823
00:42:35,085 --> 00:42:37,576
'..for the youth of
our new generation.'

00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:41,116
'l will try to stop it at any cost.'

825
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:44,093
This madam visits my hotel.

826
00:42:45,129 --> 00:42:47,097
Hey, Babloo. That.. - 'This
virus is spreading all around..'

827
00:42:47,164 --> 00:42:49,291
'..and we are
unable to do anything.'

828
00:42:49,366 --> 00:42:50,355
What's wrong?

829
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:53,398
I'm trying to sleep
and you are snoring?

830
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:55,404
In fact, not even an
animal can sleep here.

831
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:58,970
'The social worker
Sunaina Tejwani..'

832

834
00:43:05,115 --> 00:43:06,173
I hope I don't snore again.

835
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,239
'Aaj Tak.'

836
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:12,113
Hey. What?

837
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:14,246
Did you hear my snoring again?

838
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:16,457
No, I heard your snoring earlier,
but now I burst into laughter.

839
00:43:16,527 --> 00:43:18,119
You were sleeping
covering yourself with a scarf.

840
00:43:18,662 --> 00:43:19,651
Go to sleep. Go to sleep.

841
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:32,003
Oh, God. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm late. - Never mind.

842
00:43:32,076 --> 00:43:33,737
Actually.. I had been to
the Channa parlor. - I see.

843
00:43:33,811 --> 00:43:35,005
I thought, not only at night,
my face should look..

844
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:36,944
..outdated during
the day, too, right?

845
00:43:37,348 --> 00:43:39,543
Up-to-date. - Yes, the same.

846
00:43:40,017 --> 00:43:41,279
Okay, tell me, will you have pizza?

847
00:43:42,086 --> 00:43:44,077
With four pieces or eight pieces?

848
00:43:45,022 --> 00:43:47,513
Slowly. Slowly, lsha. - Yes,
we'll eat it slowly.

849
00:43:48,025 --> 00:43:49,014
I am not in a hurry today.

850
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,191
No, I mean speak softly.

851
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:54,295
Why? Is the volume
of my voice very loud?

852
00:43:55,032 --> 00:43:56,431
Am I shouting?

853
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,365
No, no. You are not shouting.

854
00:43:58,702 --> 00:43:59,964
Actually you have to shout and
talk due to the loud music..

855
00:44:00,037 --> 00:44:02,631
..at the bar at night.. - Yes.

856
00:44:02,706 --> 00:44:04,571
Do you get that?.
- That's why your tone is such.

857
00:44:05,042 --> 00:44:06,168
Nothing else.

858
00:44:06,243 --> 00:44:07,232
You are a good boy.

859
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:10,478
You are explaining to me so
lovingly so that I don't feel bad.

860
00:44:10,547 --> 00:44:12,947
You don't belong to Mumbai, right?
- No, I'm from Delhi.

861
00:44:14,184 --> 00:44:17,984
I had a desire to become an
actor since many years. So l..

862
00:44:18,055 --> 00:44:19,215
Call it an itch. An itch.

863
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:21,988
By the way, you look like a hero.

864
00:44:24,028 --> 00:44:27,520
By the way, I've been
offered a Bhojpuri film. - Yes.

865
00:44:28,198 --> 00:44:29,529
One minute. One minute.
Come on, get up.

866
00:44:30,267 --> 00:44:31,325
Get up.

867
00:44:31,402 --> 00:44:32,391
Shall I get up? - Yes.

868
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:35,468
Hey? Why have you
brought an egg here?

869
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:37,473
So that no one casts
an evil eye on you.

870
00:44:38,075 --> 00:44:40,566
I also find it very odd to
bring an egg in my purse.

871
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:43,002
But the aunty next
door has made me promise..

872
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,173
..to carry an egg in
my purse. - Yes. Softly.

873
00:44:45,249 --> 00:44:47,444
Actually destiny has
already cast an evil eye on me.

874
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:49,145
I didn't want to take
another chance. - Okay.

875
00:44:49,219 --> 00:44:51,346
That's why I spin it
around any dear one I find.

876
00:44:51,422 --> 00:44:52,480
Okay.
- One minute.

877
00:44:52,556 --> 00:44:54,547
Hey? Why are you.. spinning..

878
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:56,559
Just a sec..The
people are watching us.

879
00:44:58,362 --> 00:44:59,624
please. Hey?

880
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:03,894
Is it done? - Done.

881
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:08,232
Shall we have pizza? - Yes.

882
00:45:15,646 --> 00:45:16,635
What's wrong, Benny?

883
00:45:17,648 --> 00:45:19,980
Normally, you talk so much
that I've to switch off my radio.

884
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:22,382
Why are you so quiet today?

885
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:26,288
No, ma'am, actually I'm
mentally disturbed since two days.

886
00:45:26,657 --> 00:45:28,056
Why? What's wrong?

887
00:45:28,125 --> 00:45:30,923
You know, one madam
Tejwani comes to our hotel?

888
00:45:31,428 --> 00:45:33,555
Mrs. Tejwani? Yes, I know her.

889
00:45:34,131 --> 00:45:36,156
I saw her on TV yesterday.

890
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:39,100
She was speaking
strictly against drugs, ma'am.

891
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:43,506
Actually.. ma'am, you don't know.

892
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:46,543
A big racket of drugs is
going on in our hotel.

893
00:45:48,345 --> 00:45:50,142
No, I'm not lying..
- I know, Benny.

894
00:45:50,681 --> 00:45:51,943
You know? - Yes, I do.

895
00:45:52,015 --> 00:45:54,950
Then, ma'am.. tell madam
Tejwani and stop all this, ma'am.

896
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:57,914
Ma'am, it is a very
bad news for our hotel.

897
00:45:58,422 --> 00:45:59,548
You'll tell her, won't you, ma'am?

898
00:45:59,623 --> 00:46:04,890
Benny, they are something else on
TV and something else in real life.

899
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:08,292
You don't know
anything about Mrs. Tejwani.

900
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:15,063
Isn't he good? Look at him. - Yes.

901
00:46:16,573 --> 00:46:18,302
Are you a model? - Yes, I am.

902
00:46:19,143 --> 00:46:24,080
Where do you stay? - At Lokhandwala.

903
00:46:25,182 --> 00:46:26,206
Lokhandwala? - Yes.

904
00:46:30,053 --> 00:46:33,989
You can only afford to buy
clothes from Lokhandwala..

905
00:46:34,057 --> 00:46:37,049
..but not stay there.

906
00:46:38,662 --> 00:46:43,599
But I can afford to stay
in the Maharaja suite here.

907
00:46:48,205 --> 00:46:49,604
Would you like to
attend my room tonight?

908
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,265
Booking the Maharaja suite,
taking the boys along..

909
00:46:53,043 --> 00:46:54,067
..that, too, with different names.

910
00:46:55,012 --> 00:46:56,274
In which name is the
room booked today?

911
00:46:57,214 --> 00:46:58,875
Mr. and Mrs. Sunny Mittal.

912
00:46:59,416 --> 00:47:03,216
Wow. How do you come
up with such names?

913
00:47:03,287 --> 00:47:04,379
Thank you so much, ma'am. Thank you.

914
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:06,347
Okay, bye. - Bye.

915
00:47:06,423 --> 00:47:07,481
Those who use fake names
themselves, how will..

916
00:47:07,558 --> 00:47:08,547
..they ever support the truth?

917
00:47:11,228 --> 00:47:12,957
So, Benny, if you got
involved in these things..

918
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:15,555
..you will fall in real trouble.

919
00:47:16,066 --> 00:47:17,328
Don't pay attention to it.
Keep your eyes closed.

920
00:47:20,103 --> 00:47:22,094
Munna. - Yes? - Where is my chilly
chicken? - Yes, I'm bringing it.

921
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:23,639
Munna, where is my tea? -
I'll bring it. I'll bring it.

922
00:47:23,974 --> 00:47:25,100
Munna, bring my tea.
My tea. - I'll bring it.

923
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:26,472
Munna. - Yes. Don't yell.

924
00:47:26,543 --> 00:47:27,976
Munna, don't bring anything for me.
- Munna, listen to me.

925
00:47:28,045 --> 00:47:29,376
Hi. Hi. - Hi.
- Munna, bring tea for me.

926
00:47:29,446 --> 00:47:31,141
Hi. - Babloo, come here. Come here.

927
00:47:32,115 --> 00:47:34,015
I've brought a shirt
for you. - Wow.

928
00:47:34,985 --> 00:47:36,384
For me? - Yes. - Why have
you brought a shirt for me?

929
00:47:36,453 --> 00:47:41,049
Actually I had gone for
shopping with Ranvir. - Wow.

930
00:47:41,124 --> 00:47:43,991
I bought a shirt for him, so
I bought one for you, too.

931
00:47:44,294 --> 00:47:45,989
How is it? - The shirt is fantastic.

932
00:47:46,063 --> 00:47:47,189
But how did you remember me?

933
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:49,260
Why? Can't I remember you? - Yes.

934
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:50,391
Do you think I'm Aamir Khan
(lndian actor) from..

935
00:47:50,467 --> 00:47:51,593
..'Ghajini' (lndian Movie)?
- No, no.

936
00:47:51,668 --> 00:47:54,865
Babloo, you are too much.
How can I forget you?

937
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:58,868
You had given me Ranvir's number.
- That's true. That's true.

938
00:47:59,343 --> 00:48:01,937
You know, Ranvir has
been offered a film.

939
00:48:02,012 --> 00:48:05,209
That, too, with the main lead.
- Wow. - Fantastic.

940
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:09,242
It means he is the future
Shahrukh and you are Gauri Khan.

941
00:48:09,319 --> 00:48:11,583
That's it. - No, no. He has
been offered a Bhojpuri film.

942
00:48:11,655 --> 00:48:13,953
So what? - It means he is
Ravi Kishen (lndian actor)..

943
00:48:14,024 --> 00:48:15,252
..and you are Mrs. Kishen.

944
00:48:15,325 --> 00:48:17,156
Yes. - You talk nonsense.

945
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:20,928
Listen. - Squander. Squander a lot.

946
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:22,493
What difference does it make me?

947
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:24,589
Here starts the record.

948
00:48:24,968 --> 00:48:26,026
Hey, Babloo. - Yes?

949
00:48:26,103 --> 00:48:28,628
I know such boys.. - Yes.
- Very well.

950
00:48:30,107 --> 00:48:32,337
They want a girl who is like the
moon. - I see, you mean beautiful.

951
00:48:33,043 --> 00:48:35,978
No, my dear, by moon I mean
the girl who comes at night..

952
00:48:36,046 --> 00:48:38,105
..and goes away in the morning.

953
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:41,073
Hema, what's your problem?

954
00:48:41,385 --> 00:48:43,285
Why are you getting
jealous if I am happy? - Hey?

955
00:48:44,054 --> 00:48:46,921
Why would I feel jealous?
Am I his bed partner?

956
00:48:47,491 --> 00:48:50,153
And listen, I come to work here.

957
00:48:50,227 --> 00:48:52,252
I don't come to get into
love affairs like you.

958
00:48:52,329 --> 00:48:54,229
Anyway, who will
fall in love with you?

959
00:48:54,298 --> 00:48:58,064
You have become an old taxi
which runs on CNG. An old taxi!

960
00:48:58,135 --> 00:48:59,397
Hey. What did you say, you wretch?

961
00:48:59,469 --> 00:49:02,529
At least I'm running,
but you are flying.

962
00:49:03,173 --> 00:49:06,040
Madhubala, you are not a
Mercedes either. - Relax.

963
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:08,543
You also have to go around and
return here as an old taxi here.

964
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:10,345
Get lost. - I've seen
many girls like you.

965
00:49:10,414 --> 00:49:11,472
Forget it. Leave it. - Get lost.
You are always jealous.

966
00:49:11,548 --> 00:49:12,606
Stop saying such things.
- Forget it.

967
00:49:12,683 --> 00:49:13,945
Come here, listen
to me. Listen to me.

968
00:49:14,017 --> 00:49:15,245
Hema, forget it. - Hema, leave it.

969
00:49:16,186 --> 00:49:18,017
You are too much, Hema. Too much.

970
00:49:18,088 --> 00:49:20,249
Get lost, lsha's sidekick.
- Shut up.

971
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:23,087
Forget it, Hema. - Leave it, buddy.

972
00:49:23,393 --> 00:49:25,258
You all come to your senses as well.

973
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:28,454
I know the standard of
these boys very well.

974
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:32,962
A few moments of ours are
very precious for them..

975
00:49:33,036 --> 00:49:36,028
..but our life is very cheap.

976
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,006
But they are coming here in
five minutes. I've no time.

977
00:49:39,076 --> 00:49:40,907
And he is a VVlp. Hold on.

978
00:49:41,278 --> 00:49:43,439
What are Charles and Delvis
doing here? Out. Out. Out.

979
00:49:43,714 --> 00:49:45,079
I am in a fix. I
don't know what to do.

980
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:49,581
Hey, psycho, you will not
touch his luggage. Understand?

981
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:50,642
Stay away.

982
00:49:52,222 --> 00:49:53,348
What are the
security guards doing here?

983
00:49:53,423 --> 00:49:54,720
Come on, stand at
the main entrance. God.

984
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:55,917
Move it. Move it.

985
00:49:56,293 --> 00:49:58,318
I don't like your faces.
Come on, go and hide inside.

986
00:49:58,395 --> 00:49:59,384
Come on, both of you.

987
00:50:01,064 --> 00:50:03,225
Is the minister's favorite
suite No. 430 ready? - Yes, sir.

988
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:04,392
Are his flowers ready? - Yes, sir.

989
00:50:04,468 --> 00:50:06,163
Smile, Venice, please. - Sorry, sir.

990
00:50:06,236 --> 00:50:07,225
Go and double check.
Come on, move it.

991
00:50:07,637 --> 00:50:09,662
Yes, Nikhil. Oh, yes,
everything is under control.

992
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:12,140
Of course. Yes. There
is no margin for error.

993
00:50:13,543 --> 00:50:15,010
Hey. Nikhil, I swear..
- Sir. Sir. Sir. Sir.

994
00:50:15,078 --> 00:50:16,545
I'll make sure it's okay..
For God's sake.

995
00:50:18,415 --> 00:50:21,179
What are you doing? -
I'm sorry, sir. Sorry, sir.

996
00:50:21,251 --> 00:50:23,014
What are you doing? - Sir,
I was saving you, sir.

997
00:50:23,086 --> 00:50:24,246
I would've gotten out of there.
Do you have any problem?

998
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:26,011
Sir, it is the X-ray machine,
everything is exposed, sir.

999
00:50:26,089 --> 00:50:27,147
I'm really sorry, sir.

1000
00:50:27,224 --> 00:50:29,624
Oh, yes. Very intelligent. Nikhil..

1001
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:31,957
'Welcome to Hotel Mirage.'

1002
00:50:32,662 --> 00:50:34,129
Now come on, welcome them nicely.

1003
00:50:35,565 --> 00:50:37,624
Sir, your favorite suite
430 has been organized.

1004
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:40,032
What are you doing? What
are you doing? - Sorry, sir.

1005
00:50:40,103 --> 00:50:41,161
What are you doing? Why are you
standing so close to me?

1006
00:50:41,238 --> 00:50:42,296
Sorry, sir. Sorry, sir.

1007
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:43,430
What sorry? - Sir, they have..

1008
00:50:43,507 --> 00:50:44,565
They what? - They have left, sir.

1009
00:50:44,641 --> 00:50:45,630
Who has left? - They have left, sir.

1010
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:46,971
Oh, my God. Now you're telling me?

1011
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:50,445
Welcome, sir. You are
welcome to Mirage, Mr. Gaikwad.

1012
00:50:50,514 --> 00:50:52,311
Welcome me with a
hug once in a while.

1013
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:55,548
Your room No. 430
is absolutely ready.

1014
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:56,608
Enjoy the stay.

1015
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:01,046
Rascal.

1016
00:51:04,094 --> 00:51:06,221
Sir.. - What's this
cupcake carrying there?

1017
00:51:06,997 --> 00:51:08,328
Hello, baby. - Good evening, sir.

1018
00:51:08,665 --> 00:51:12,931
Good evening. And
good maintenance also.

1019
00:51:14,671 --> 00:51:17,003
The way you maintain
this hotel's rooms..

1020
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:19,440
..you have maintained your
mind blowing figure, too.

1021
00:51:21,011 --> 00:51:22,000
Wow.

1022
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:24,469
Racal.

1023
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:28,479
Well, that guy.. - But..

1024
00:51:28,552 --> 00:51:31,680
Sir, I had requested you
for a licence.. - Shut up.

1025
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:33,689
Sir, the licence.. - Why are
you talking about the licence?

1026
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:38,023
Look, you do my work and
I'll do yours. Got it?

1027
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:39,153
Yes, sir. Right, sir. - Yes.

1028
00:51:39,229 --> 00:51:40,628
Instead of placing a pie in my hand,
you're talking about the licence..

1029
00:51:40,697 --> 00:51:41,686
Rascal! - What?

1030
00:51:42,365 --> 00:51:44,526
Sir, the bar is open.
24 hours a day.

1031
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:45,966
What do you mean by the
bar is open? You're scared..

1032
00:51:47,637 --> 00:51:51,573
"I'll meet Rogers today.
He'll give me a girl."

1033
00:51:51,641 --> 00:51:52,699
"I'll meet.."

1034
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:54,539
Oh, Rogers. - Welcome. Welcome.
Welcome, sir.

1035
00:51:55,245 --> 00:51:57,440
Yes. God. - But, sir, what's this?

1036
00:51:57,514 --> 00:52:00,244
What's wrong?
- You seem very drained out, sir.

1037
00:52:00,317 --> 00:52:01,477
Is it that easy to fool farmers?

1038
00:52:03,987 --> 00:52:05,113
I'm exhausted after roaming with..

1039
00:52:05,188 --> 00:52:06,655
..these farmers in the
sun since two weeks.

1040
00:52:08,158 --> 00:52:10,592
So you've given so much service.

1041
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:11,718
What service have I given?

1042
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:14,127
Sir, these both will
give service to you.

1043
00:52:14,598 --> 00:52:17,123
"They are the greenery
and l.. - Welcome, sir.

1044
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,258
"l am the path."

1045
00:52:18,335 --> 00:52:20,929
Wow, darling. Great. Two ladies.

1046
00:52:21,271 --> 00:52:25,071
I love you. And what you do?

1047
00:52:29,179 --> 00:52:30,168
Wow.

1048
00:52:31,748 --> 00:52:33,477
Why are you staring
wide-eyed at me?

1049
00:52:35,385 --> 00:52:37,080
Do you want to sit here?
Come on, sir.

1050
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:38,485
Madam, shift aside.
Let sir sit here.

1051
00:52:39,022 --> 00:52:40,080
No, sir. No.

1052
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:41,488
No? Then why are
looking here? Get lost.

1053
00:52:42,526 --> 00:52:44,619
Does he think any
drama is going on here?

1054
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:48,454
Come on, come here. You
aren't the bellboy, right?

1055
00:52:49,032 --> 00:52:50,897
You are my bell and I'm your boy.

1056
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:53,894
Darling, I like you.
English correct, right?

1057
00:52:54,971 --> 00:52:55,960
Rascal.

1058
00:52:59,976 --> 00:53:01,204
Benny, why are you surprised?

1059
00:53:01,278 --> 00:53:04,076
Every white collared man
does black business here.

1060
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:06,281
You know what is the
tragedy of our country?

1061
00:53:06,983 --> 00:53:09,645
There is armed Z-security appointed
for corrupt men from A to Z.

1062
00:53:10,387 --> 00:53:11,581
But I've watched on TV.

1063
00:53:11,655 --> 00:53:13,919
This.. This Gaikwad has
helped the farmers a lot.

1064
00:53:14,658 --> 00:53:15,989
He pulls the plough
with the farmers there..

1065
00:53:16,059 --> 00:53:18,584
..and enjoys with the girls here.

1066
00:53:19,062 --> 00:53:20,996
You know, the stay,
food and everything..

1067
00:53:21,064 --> 00:53:22,531
..is absolutely free for him here.

1068
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:23,930
Absolutely free of cost.

1069
00:53:24,434 --> 00:53:26,994
Because all the illegal
businesses of this hotel..

1070
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:30,096
..are concealed by his
political connections.

1071
00:53:31,408 --> 00:53:35,936
Ms. Hema, your eyes are very
beautiful. They are large.

1072
00:53:37,614 --> 00:53:40,674
I've got them for free with my
face. What do you want to do?

1073
00:53:42,085 --> 00:53:43,450
No, it is not so.

1074
00:53:44,254 --> 00:53:48,452
Actually I've given up food
and drinks ever since I saw you.

1075
00:53:49,426 --> 00:53:51,417
You have stopped drinking,
too? - Yes.

1076
00:53:51,494 --> 00:53:54,292
If you are so broke, why
do you come to the bar?

1077
00:53:56,967 --> 00:54:03,031
"Beloved, I'll die without you.
Come, oh, my life."

1078
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:04,598
"Beloved, I'll die without you.
Come, oh, my life."

1079
00:54:04,674 --> 00:54:06,437
What should I bring,
sir? - Call that Vandana.

1080
00:54:07,277 --> 00:54:08,972
Hey, Vandana, that guest
of yours with a moustache is here.

1081
00:54:09,045 --> 00:54:10,205
Come quickly.

1082
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:16,041
"l had to come, beloved. The
pain of love is unbearable."

1083
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:17,381
Neither you receive
my calls nor meet me.

1084
00:54:18,121 --> 00:54:19,110
I've squandered
thousands of rupees on you.

1085
00:54:20,156 --> 00:54:21,646
Do you think I am a donation box?

1086
00:54:22,225 --> 00:54:23,920
You don't meet me after arousing
the desire within, you wretch.

1087
00:54:24,561 --> 00:54:26,290
Alright. If not you,
then some other girl.

1088
00:54:26,563 --> 00:54:27,552
Not her, then someone else.

1089
00:54:27,998 --> 00:54:29,488
Hey, who is the
naughtiest amongst them?

1090
00:54:29,566 --> 00:54:30,931
What do I know? Ask them yourself.

1091
00:54:32,669 --> 00:54:34,603
Hey? Vandana? - Vandana,
what's wrong?

1092
00:54:35,338 --> 00:54:36,498
What's wrong? - Why are you crying?

1093
00:54:36,573 --> 00:54:38,006
Vandana? What's wrong?

1094
00:54:38,074 --> 00:54:40,235
Drink water. Have some water.
- What's wrong? Drink water.

1095
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:41,675
Do you know what happened to her?
- Vandana, drink water.

1096
00:54:42,746 --> 00:54:44,680
What's wrong with her?
- What happened to her?

1097
00:54:45,015 --> 00:54:45,982
I don't know what happened.

1098
00:54:46,416 --> 00:54:49,613
I am not.. I am not a
characterless woman, Babloo.

1099
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:54,146
I'm the daughter of a
farmer of Satara village.

1100
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:59,087
My father is sick. He
has a hole in his heart.

1101
00:54:59,162 --> 00:55:01,426
I've to collect a lot of
money for his treatment.

1102
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:04,964
My neighbor told me that
this is the only way..

1103
00:55:05,035 --> 00:55:07,503
..through which an illiterate
girl like me can earn some money.

1104
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:10,967
I've to give 20 % of my
earnings to the person..

1105
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:13,942
..who got me hired here.

1106
00:55:15,178 --> 00:55:19,478
I spend the rest of the money in
buying medicines for my father.

1107
00:55:21,117 --> 00:55:25,417
But still.. still I've not
done anything wrong till today.

1108
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:31,251
I swear by Sai Baba (lndian God)..
I'm not a characterless woman.

1109
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:34,991
We know it. They talk
nonsense after getting drunk.

1110
00:55:37,467 --> 00:55:40,095
You will have to drink the poison
if you stay in a snake's burrow.

1111
00:55:40,437 --> 00:55:42,997
It's okay, baby. I also
have to hear so many taunts..

1112
00:55:43,073 --> 00:55:46,474
..from my relatives and society.

1113
00:55:47,077 --> 00:55:48,942
Since we work in a bar,
everyone thinks..

1114
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:52,004
..that we go to bed with someone
everyday after the hotel shuts down.

1115
00:55:52,082 --> 00:55:55,381
Vandana, we all know who
and what you are. Forget it.

1116
00:55:56,086 --> 00:55:59,419
Yes, Roshni, you
are absolutely right.

1117
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:03,120
You know how she is now.

1118
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:09,023
But only I know how this
profession will affect her tomorrow.

1119
00:56:10,233 --> 00:56:12,565
Till when will you hide yourself?

1120
00:56:13,336 --> 00:56:16,601
One day you will be sold
at Nasrullah Khan's market.

1121
00:56:22,245 --> 00:56:23,234
By the way, tell me something.

1122
00:56:24,247 --> 00:56:26,010
She goes home directly after
the bar shuts down, right?

1123
00:56:26,449 --> 00:56:28,417
Why are you asking? - I'll tell you.

1124
00:56:38,328 --> 00:56:41,525
Isha, what.. What are you doing?
Keep aside this dagger..

1125
00:56:41,598 --> 00:56:46,331
Hema, today you will have to
cut a cake with this dagger.

1126
00:56:49,205 --> 00:56:52,868
Happy birthday. - Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday, Hema.

1127
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:58,410
What are you guys mad of?

1128
00:56:59,215 --> 00:57:01,945
I taunt you on whatever
you say and today you all..

1129
00:57:02,018 --> 00:57:04,486
..have come to cut my
birthday cake?

1130
00:57:06,556 --> 00:57:08,956
I talk so bitterly
with you all and you..

1131
00:57:09,025 --> 00:57:11,960
Hema, we do have
these petty quarrels..

1132
00:57:12,028 --> 00:57:14,496
..but it doesn't mean
that we are enemies.

1133
00:57:14,564 --> 00:57:20,002
Happy birthday to you.
Happy birthday to you.

1134
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:25,205
Happy birthday to dear, Hema.

1135
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:29,302
Happy birthday to you.

1136
00:57:29,379 --> 00:57:31,074
Eat less otherwise
you'll become obese.

1137
00:57:32,482 --> 00:57:35,417
My real name is parveen.
I belong to Lucknow.

1138
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:39,313
I was the most famous
bar girl of my time.

1139
00:57:41,357 --> 00:57:44,087
people used to
squander a lot of money on me.

1140
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:50,926
My parents, uncle and aunty,
siblings, their children..

1141
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,060
..everyone depended on
the earnings of my dance.

1142
00:57:54,938 --> 00:57:58,169
One day Akhilesh came there.
He went crazy about me.

1143
00:57:59,576 --> 00:58:01,942
And one day he
announced in the bar that..

1144
00:58:02,011 --> 00:58:05,606
..today is Hema's
last night at the bar.

1145
00:58:06,216 --> 00:58:07,945
Because he was going to marry me.

1146
00:58:09,352 --> 00:58:13,482
I left everything and held his hand.

1147
00:58:14,958 --> 00:58:17,392
I felt as if I've
found a true lover..

1148
00:58:18,094 --> 00:58:20,392
..someone who will
support me all my life.

1149
00:58:21,564 --> 00:58:22,963
I started living like
a respectable wife..

1150
00:58:23,032 --> 00:58:25,330
..in the flat given by him.

1151
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:32,904
Then one day I learnt that..
Akhilesh is already married.

1152
00:58:35,144 --> 00:58:36,338
He had two children.

1153
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:43,976
One day his wife came to my flat..

1154
00:58:44,053 --> 00:58:49,081
..and threw me out like a
dog while I was bare feet.

1155
00:58:56,366 --> 00:59:01,497
Akhilesh went out of lndia,
but I was bearing his child.

1156
00:59:03,139 --> 00:59:05,937
I felt embarrassed and
returned back to my parents..

1157
00:59:06,009 --> 00:59:08,534
..whom I had brought up for years.

1158
00:59:10,346 --> 00:59:12,940
But even they were unable
to put up with my infamy..

1159
00:59:13,016 --> 00:59:16,110
..and the news of my
illegitimate child.

1160
00:59:18,955 --> 00:59:21,947
I had to return to the same bar..

1161
00:59:22,025 --> 00:59:25,256
..from which I had
left with Akhilesh once.

1162
00:59:37,473 --> 00:59:39,031
I've a 12 year-old-child.

1163
00:59:41,477 --> 00:59:44,969
I'm maintaining the cost of his
boarding.. with great difficulty.

1164
00:59:50,153 --> 00:59:52,986
I don't want anyone
else to go through..

1165
00:59:53,056 --> 00:59:55,923
..what I had to.

1166
00:59:59,062 --> 01:00:02,998
You don't know, when a
young girl becomes old..

1167
01:00:03,066 --> 01:00:07,230
..no one even gives her a glance.

1168
01:00:10,673 --> 01:00:15,576
Now my child doesn't
have anyone except me.

1169
01:00:19,182 --> 01:00:22,515
No, Hema, you stay the same.

1170
01:00:23,653 --> 01:00:27,020
Say bitter things to everyone.
- No, lsha, I am..

1171
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:30,082
Hema, how can you say
that you don't have anyone?

1172
01:00:30,526 --> 01:00:32,357
That your child doesn't
have anyone except you?

1173
01:00:32,695 --> 01:00:33,684
Shall I say something?

1174
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:37,363
Your child won't get so many
aunties in any bumper sale as well.

1175
01:00:37,433 --> 01:00:38,491
Right? - Yes.

1176
01:00:40,203 --> 01:00:44,139
Yes. And this Soni is also a
part of your family from today.

1177
01:00:44,774 --> 01:00:46,969
My real name is Aakruti.

1178
01:00:47,343 --> 01:00:50,642
Yes. And my name is
not lsha, it is Sarita.

1179
01:00:51,047 --> 01:00:53,015
Vandana. My real name is Niranjana.

1180
01:00:53,082 --> 01:00:55,380
And my real name is
not Roshni, but Anjali.

1181
01:00:55,451 --> 01:00:58,443
pedora. Real name is Marina.

1182
01:00:58,521 --> 01:01:01,581
Babloo. And the real
name is also Babloo.

1183
01:01:08,731 --> 01:01:12,132
"By signalling through my eyes.."

1184
01:01:12,201 --> 01:01:15,193
"..I'll steal your heart."

1185
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:19,335
"By signalling through my eyes.."

1186
01:01:19,409 --> 01:01:22,640
"..I'll steal your heart."

1187
01:01:22,712 --> 01:01:26,341
"Why don't you understand me?"

1188
01:01:26,416 --> 01:01:30,011
"Why don't you understand me?"

1189
01:01:30,086 --> 01:01:33,613
"Why do you turn away
your face and abuse me?"

1190
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:35,351
"Oh, Dolly."

1191
01:01:35,425 --> 01:01:36,585
"I'm Dolly."

1192
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:40,085
"Darling, I am your Dolly."

1193
01:01:40,163 --> 01:01:43,599
"I'm Dolly. I'm Dolly.
I'm Dolly. I'm Dolly."

1194
01:01:43,666 --> 01:01:46,430
"I'm Dolly. I'm Dolly.
I'm Dolly. I'm Dolly."

1195
01:01:46,502 --> 01:01:49,960
"Why don't you understand me?"

1196
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:53,975
"Why do you turn away
your face and abuse me?"

1197
01:01:54,043 --> 01:01:55,169
"Oh, Dolly."

1198
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:58,180
"Darling, you are my Dolly."

1199
01:01:58,247 --> 01:02:01,910
"Oh, Dolly. My Dolly. Oh, Dolly."

1200
01:02:02,985 --> 01:02:06,978
We know each other so well now.

1201
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:11,459
Why are you shying away then?
I'll quench your thirst.

1202
01:02:11,527 --> 01:02:15,327
Oh, God.
- What happened? What?

1203
01:02:20,203 --> 01:02:22,603
What? - Nothing.

1204
01:02:22,672 --> 01:02:26,403
Nothing? Nothing happened?
- No, nothing happened.

1205
01:02:26,476 --> 01:02:28,000
Then why did you barge in
like that? - Just like that.

1206
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:29,408
Nothing, just like that.

1207
01:02:30,012 --> 01:02:32,207
But a lot happened at our place.

1208
01:02:33,216 --> 01:02:36,014
Take this. Eat this. Eat this.
- What's this?

1209
01:02:36,085 --> 01:02:40,078
It was Hema's birthday and
we all celebrated it a lot.

1210
01:02:40,156 --> 01:02:41,555
Do you know? Everyone
there is illiterate..

1211
01:02:41,624 --> 01:02:44,218
..but everyone has a
degree in giving love.

1212
01:02:44,293 --> 01:02:48,957
Oh, that's true. But.. the
degree of love they give..

1213
01:02:49,031 --> 01:02:50,020
..is a problem.

1214
01:02:54,036 --> 01:02:55,970
Working at a wrong
place doesn't mean that..

1215
01:02:56,038 --> 01:02:57,027
..they are wrong as well.

1216
01:02:58,174 --> 01:02:59,971
You used to say,
"See again and again..

1217
01:03:00,042 --> 01:03:01,976
Babloo's ladies bar".
I did take a look.

1218
01:03:02,044 --> 01:03:04,444
I watched all the girls closely.

1219
01:03:04,981 --> 01:03:08,382
I've understood their
lives and their circumstances.

1220
01:03:08,985 --> 01:03:10,976
Benny, I've felt that
their acceptance is..

1221
01:03:11,053 --> 01:03:13,044
..their helplessness.

1222
01:03:14,123 --> 01:03:15,112
You talk too much.

1223
01:03:15,591 --> 01:03:17,991
No one asks money from
anyone forcibly over there.

1224
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:19,925
Everyone gives them
money on their own.

1225
01:03:20,196 --> 01:03:24,530
Working there is not bad.. but
the filth in people's mind is bad.

1226
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:30,470
Actually, I was just..
You.. you get angry very fast.

1227
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:32,405
Let go.. - Come here. Sit here.

1228
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:33,464
How can you talk like this?

1229
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:38,140
I apologize to you from
the bottom of my heart. Okay?

1230
01:03:39,148 --> 01:03:42,549
Will you have tea? - I'll
eat glucose biscuits, too.

1231
01:03:43,352 --> 01:03:46,082
You ask for a lot more than what
is offered to you Brother Babloo.

1232
01:03:51,294 --> 01:03:53,626
Don't misunderstand them. - Okay.

1233
01:03:53,696 --> 01:03:56,893
Eat this.. Eat this.

1234
01:04:01,971 --> 01:04:09,969
"Why don't you get the
destination of happiness?"

1235
01:04:10,046 --> 01:04:11,104
"On every step there is.."

1236
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:12,306
Hey, Sheena. Look at this.

1237
01:04:12,982 --> 01:04:16,383
We can own a holiday home in
Kajrat only in 36 installments.

1238
01:04:16,452 --> 01:04:21,981
"On every step, there's pain.."
- Listen, only 36 installments!

1239
01:04:22,058 --> 01:04:24,993
"Why is it like this?"

1240
01:04:25,061 --> 01:04:33,992
"Why is this city so isolated?"

1241
01:04:34,070 --> 01:04:36,004
"Why is this city so isolated?"

1242
01:04:36,072 --> 01:04:40,270
What's the matter, ma'am? You
look very sad and sullen today.

1243
01:04:40,343 --> 01:04:43,073
Nothing. - I am sure
there's something.

1244
01:04:43,145 --> 01:04:44,203
Tell me.

1245
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:47,272
Stop it. Who are you to
ask me? - Benny, the..

1246
01:04:49,952 --> 01:04:52,887
Sorry, ma'am.. - Benny..

1247
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:54,545
Yes, ma'am.

1248
01:04:59,962 --> 01:05:02,487
I am sorry. I am really sorry.

1249
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:07,229
Actually, these days, l
have so many problems that..

1250
01:05:07,303 --> 01:05:11,433
problems? Ma'am, what problems
can rich people like you have?

1251
01:05:11,507 --> 01:05:13,304
There's a major
problem of our class.

1252
01:05:14,443 --> 01:05:17,310
We never get satisfied.
We have a lot..

1253
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:19,311
..but in the greed
of getting all these..

1254
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:22,312
..we end up paying
loans all our lives.

1255
01:05:22,985 --> 01:05:24,247
We keep giving EMls.

1256
01:05:26,255 --> 01:05:30,191
My husband, Abhishek, is a
severe patient of this disease.

1257
01:05:32,662 --> 01:05:34,994
Benny, do you know
what's the toughest?

1258
01:05:37,266 --> 01:05:39,996
In spite of so many problems,
I always have to keep a smile..

1259
01:05:40,069 --> 01:05:42,469
..on my face in my job.

1260
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:47,542
Just like a bar girl
standing at a ladies bar.

1261
01:05:49,345 --> 01:05:51,870
Look, I know that l
am going for 20 days.

1262
01:05:52,214 --> 01:05:54,148
I've an outdoor shooting in Ooty.

1263
01:05:54,216 --> 01:05:55,274
What's the name of the movie?

1264
01:05:55,351 --> 01:05:59,287
'Bhaujai Ki Saugand,
Tohara Ke Gaad Ke Rakhdaye'.

1265
01:05:59,355 --> 01:06:01,482
Are you telling me the
movie's name or its story?

1266
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:06,219
You talk so sweetly when angry.

1267
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:11,025
Oh, God, I am getting late. The
production guy is waiting for me.

1268
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:13,159
production? - Yes. Okay, I'll leave.

1269
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:21,235
Won't you ward off the
evil eye with an egg? - Yes.

1270
01:06:25,047 --> 01:06:26,036
Enough..

1271
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:35,120
Done. Take this. - Hey, why this?

1272
01:06:35,191 --> 01:06:36,385
Keep it. It will be of use to you.

1273
01:06:36,459 --> 01:06:39,121
Look, Veer, if you have money,
people will be around you.

1274
01:06:39,462 --> 01:06:41,657
Improve your standard. - But, lsha..

1275
01:06:41,731 --> 01:06:43,392
Come on. You are getting late,
aren't you? production..

1276
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:48,126
Listen.. don't say 'bye.' And yes,
don't look back either.

1277
01:06:48,537 --> 01:06:51,938
The thing is that l
can't handle emotions.

1278
01:06:52,541 --> 01:06:53,872
Take care of yourself. Okay?

1279
01:06:56,946 --> 01:06:57,935
Bye.

1280
01:07:01,951 --> 01:07:07,355
"Separation.. I hope
no one ever separates."

1281
01:07:07,957 --> 01:07:13,088
"Separation.. Oh, God, l
hope no one ever separates."

1282
01:07:17,433 --> 01:07:19,094
What's the matter?
Why are you sullen?

1283
01:07:19,969 --> 01:07:20,958
Separation.

1284
01:07:22,304 --> 01:07:24,238
Look, Ranvir has gone to Ooty..

1285
01:07:24,306 --> 01:07:26,968
..so rule over the world now.
Call him. - Shall l?

1286
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:30,376
Yes.. - But he must be busy. -
Well.. - He'll get angry on me.

1287
01:07:30,446 --> 01:07:32,573
He'll feel happy if
you call. Call him.

1288
01:07:32,648 --> 01:07:35,515
Open my hands once, Ganga Thakur..

1289
01:07:36,185 --> 01:07:38,585
..I'll break your head.

1290
01:07:39,455 --> 01:07:41,980
I swear on my sister-in-law.

1291
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:44,458
'Hey, Brother.. answer the call.'

1292
01:07:44,527 --> 01:07:46,518
Cut. Cut. - 'l am not
giving you a missed call.'

1293
01:07:46,595 --> 01:07:49,189
Whose phone is ringing? - Sir..
Sir, my phone is ringing.

1294
01:07:49,265 --> 01:07:52,132
'Answer the call. I am
calling you. Hey, Brother.'

1295
01:07:52,201 --> 01:07:53,930
What kind of a ring tone
is this? - 'Did you get it?'

1296
01:07:54,003 --> 01:07:55,095
My pressure is going
up after hearing this.

1297
01:07:55,171 --> 01:07:56,399
'pick up the call, Brother.'
- Hello.

1298
01:07:56,472 --> 01:07:58,599
Sir, press the green
button first. - Okay.

1299
01:07:58,674 --> 01:08:02,405
Hello? Hello? Talk
to him. - Yes. Hello?

1300
01:08:02,945 --> 01:08:06,881
"Separation." - How are you?
I was missing you a lot.

1301
01:08:07,416 --> 01:08:10,476
The song "Separation"
is being played.. so..

1302
01:08:10,553 --> 01:08:13,954
Hello, lsha, I am on my shoot.
Shall I talk to you later?

1303
01:08:14,290 --> 01:08:16,155
I told Babloo.. but he..

1304
01:08:17,026 --> 01:08:19,358
Hello, Mr. Ranvir.. This is Babloo.

1305
01:08:19,428 --> 01:08:21,089
How's the shooting going on?

1306
01:08:21,163 --> 01:08:22,960
Look, Babloo,
listen to me carefully.

1307
01:08:23,299 --> 01:08:26,564
The sad songs will go on there
and lsha will keep missing me.

1308
01:08:26,635 --> 01:08:31,038
If you called again.. I'll
kill the villain here later..

1309
01:08:31,307 --> 01:08:33,172
..but I'll kill you first by
coming to Mumbai. Is that clear?

1310
01:08:33,576 --> 01:08:36,306
Sir, it's done. - "Oh, beloved."

1311
01:08:36,378 --> 01:08:38,175
Why did you disconnect
the phone? What did he say?

1312
01:08:38,581 --> 01:08:41,243
He threatened to
kill me. - Kill you?

1313
01:08:41,317 --> 01:08:45,913
No, the villain.. in the shooting.
- "Oh, beloved."

1314
01:08:45,988 --> 01:08:48,582
Shall I call him again?
I am missing him a lot.

1315
01:08:48,657 --> 01:08:52,252
No, it's better if we change the
song instead. pinky, change the song.

1316
01:08:52,328 --> 01:08:54,125
Shall I sing, "l
can't live without you?"

1317
01:08:55,464 --> 01:08:57,125
Come on, let's go
inside and talk. Come here.

1318
01:09:01,203 --> 01:09:03,467
Good evening, sir.
Is everything fine?

1319
01:09:03,539 --> 01:09:05,939
Would you like
something else? - I want you.

1320
01:09:06,008 --> 01:09:07,407
How dare you talk to me like that!

1321
01:09:07,476 --> 01:09:08,943
Don't think of this as
complementary like..

1322
01:09:09,011 --> 01:09:10,876
..your fruits and chocolates.

1323
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:12,469
I'll pay for it.

1324
01:09:15,951 --> 01:09:18,010
Rs. 1 lakh. - Stop it, sir.

1325
01:09:18,287 --> 01:09:20,084
By giving Rs. 1 lakh do
you think that I'll sleep..

1326
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:24,092
Rs. 2 lakhs. My hard
work and your time.

1327
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:25,354
I am not that type of a girl.

1328
01:09:26,095 --> 01:09:27,153
Nothing like that
can happen between us.

1329
01:09:27,229 --> 01:09:32,223
It can happen between us..
because you're just as..

1330
01:09:33,702 --> 01:09:35,101
..beautiful as rich I am.

1331
01:09:37,239 --> 01:09:40,572
This is Rs. 3 lakhs.
Before refusing them..

1332
01:09:40,643 --> 01:09:42,975
..think what all you
can do with this money.

1333
01:09:43,712 --> 01:09:47,978
You can buy a new car,
l-pods, jewelry, new wardrobe..

1334
01:09:48,050 --> 01:09:49,176
..you can buy your dreams.

1335
01:09:53,722 --> 01:09:57,590
Hey, hello. Who's parked
this car in my parking area?

1336
01:09:58,394 --> 01:10:00,328
It belongs to Ms. Ria
living in room no. 401.

1337
01:10:01,263 --> 01:10:03,197
She's ordered a new car from
the showroom today itself.

1338
01:10:08,003 --> 01:10:09,937
New car or a new adventure?

1339
01:10:34,029 --> 01:10:35,018
Sir, your luggage?
- 'Beautiful shot.'

1340
01:10:36,098 --> 01:10:37,622
Interesting match, sir.

1341
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:41,126
'Went off his pads. Just outside.
Ramiz Raja..'

1342
01:10:42,371 --> 01:10:44,965
Oh, God. Sorry, sir. Sir.

1343
01:10:48,310 --> 01:10:51,973
What a six, sir! Sir?
- 'A sneak shot, but..'

1344
01:10:52,047 --> 01:10:55,448
Remote here, sir. Okay? Sir?

1345
01:10:55,517 --> 01:10:58,975
'Every shot from the pakistanis..'

1346
01:11:11,333 --> 01:11:12,595
Sir? Oh, God..

1347
01:11:16,005 --> 01:11:19,133
Hey, Benny.. what happened, man?

1348
01:11:19,608 --> 01:11:23,009
I touched. He fall..

1349
01:11:23,345 --> 01:11:26,280
Doctor? - No way. He's dead.

1350
01:11:26,615 --> 01:11:28,014
He's dead? - Yes.

1351
01:11:28,083 --> 01:11:30,142
I know he's dead. Come on, doctor.

1352
01:11:30,219 --> 01:11:32,084
You know what to do
with the dead body. - Yes.

1353
01:11:32,154 --> 01:11:34,019
As always, take him
to your nursing home.

1354
01:11:34,356 --> 01:11:36,483
And declare him dead there. - Okay.

1355
01:11:36,558 --> 01:11:38,958
After that we'll
inform his family. - Okay.

1356
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:42,093
Come on, move. Idiot.

1357
01:11:42,164 --> 01:11:43,222
Neeta.. - Yes, sir.

1358
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:44,960
Arrange for a house
keeping trolley. - Right, sir.

1359
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:48,300
What's the room number? - Sir, 309.

1360
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:51,030
Nikhil, what's the
outstanding of room No. 309?

1361
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:55,171
Rs. 70000 sir.. - Rs. 70000?
Are you crazy?

1362
01:11:55,244 --> 01:11:56,506
No, sir. - Where are you right now?

1363
01:11:56,578 --> 01:11:59,046
In the reception, sir. - You
just wait there, I am coming.

1364
01:11:59,114 --> 01:12:03,983
I am coming right away.
What are you staring at? What?

1365
01:12:04,453 --> 01:12:05,511
What? - Nothing, sir.

1366
01:12:05,587 --> 01:12:07,521
Then move, Benny.
Come on. - Yes, sir.

1367
01:12:07,589 --> 01:12:10,387
Butt, what, sir? - It is this.
This, this is your behind. Got it?

1368
01:12:10,459 --> 01:12:11,585
Yes, sir. - Move.

1369
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:13,252
Nikhil, did he have
to die in our hotel?

1370
01:12:13,329 --> 01:12:14,318
Ronnie, let go.. - How strange!

1371
01:12:14,596 --> 01:12:17,258
There's a death in our hotel.
Inform the police.

1372
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:19,267
police? Are you out of your mind?

1373
01:12:19,335 --> 01:12:22,327
police means media.
Media means public.

1374
01:12:22,404 --> 01:12:24,201
public means our customers.

1375
01:12:24,273 --> 01:12:26,605
Look, if they learn that a
death has taken place here..

1376
01:12:26,675 --> 01:12:27,937
..they won't come here.

1377
01:12:28,210 --> 01:12:30,405
Then both of us will have to
go look for a job together.

1378
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:33,414
You do one thing. Fold his luggage,
I'll fold him by then.

1379
01:12:34,216 --> 01:12:36,081
'Sir, your favorite
suite 309 is ready.'

1380
01:12:36,151 --> 01:12:38,676
'Your favorite flowers. Your
favorite dark chocolates.'

1381
01:12:38,754 --> 01:12:40,278
'Nikhil, did he have
to die in our hotel?'

1382
01:12:40,356 --> 01:12:41,345
'How strange!'

1383
01:12:42,291 --> 01:12:44,282
Benny.. Benny,
pose for a photograph.

1384
01:12:57,106 --> 01:13:00,974
Benny, look there.. Look there.
She's totally changed.

1385
01:13:04,513 --> 01:13:06,447
Who is it? - It's Ria.

1386
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:13,311
Rs. 3 lakhs, Ria? Wow.

1387
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:16,324
That, too, in one hour. - What?

1388
01:13:17,059 --> 01:13:20,517
It is faster than taking out
money from the ATM. - Right.

1389
01:13:20,596 --> 01:13:21,995
If you come for the duty..
then people touch..

1390
01:13:22,064 --> 01:13:24,123
..you here and there for free.

1391
01:13:24,533 --> 01:13:26,000
So why not get paid for it?

1392
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:29,337
If I have car today.. I'll also
get a boyfriend who owns a car.

1393
01:13:29,605 --> 01:13:31,004
If you travel in a bus,
you'll get a boyfriend..

1394
01:13:31,073 --> 01:13:32,404
..who owns a bike at the most.

1395
01:13:33,008 --> 01:13:35,408
'Hi, handsome.'

1396
01:13:36,412 --> 01:13:38,403
'Do you want to be friends with me?'

1397
01:13:39,681 --> 01:13:40,943
'Hi, I am Jennifer.'

1398
01:13:42,217 --> 01:13:44,617
'Welcome to Hotel Mirage.'

1399
01:14:11,246 --> 01:14:12,304
You.. - Mumbai police.

1400
01:14:12,381 --> 01:14:13,370
Special branch.

1401
01:14:18,987 --> 01:14:20,648
This has been going on
in your hotel a lot.

1402
01:14:20,722 --> 01:14:22,986
This prostitution in
pretext of escort service.

1403
01:14:23,058 --> 01:14:24,116
Tomorrow when it is
published in the newspapers..

1404
01:14:24,193 --> 01:14:25,182
..you'll get to know everything.

1405
01:14:25,661 --> 01:14:27,390
Sir, these are regular
guests of our hotel.

1406
01:14:27,463 --> 01:14:29,260
Sir, and then he's a very
respectable businessman.

1407
01:14:29,331 --> 01:14:31,322
Sir, what do we know what he
does inside the hotel room?

1408
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:32,389
We have no idea, sir.

1409
01:14:33,135 --> 01:14:35,069
Is it a 5 star hotel or an
inn near the check post?

1410
01:14:35,137 --> 01:14:36,126
Will you do anything here?

1411
01:14:37,139 --> 01:14:39,471
Sir, this is the matter
of our hotel's reputation.

1412
01:14:39,541 --> 01:14:41,475
Sir, anyway, this is
a very minor issue.

1413
01:14:41,543 --> 01:14:44,068
We can sort it out.. over..
over a cup of coffee, sir.

1414
01:14:44,146 --> 01:14:45,340
If you want, you can
have tea as well, sir.

1415
01:14:45,614 --> 01:14:46,945
The one with less water.

1416
01:14:47,015 --> 01:14:48,141
Ronnie, what's so urgent?

1417
01:14:48,217 --> 01:14:49,411
You come, I'll show you.

1418
01:14:50,352 --> 01:14:51,341
Where is the other party?

1419
01:14:52,154 --> 01:14:53,143
Benny, come with me.

1420
01:14:53,622 --> 01:14:56,090
Benny, come on. - They've
handcuffed school girls.

1421
01:14:56,158 --> 01:14:57,955
They are not school girls,
they are teachers.

1422
01:14:58,026 --> 01:14:59,015
The principal is inside. Come on.

1423
01:15:01,096 --> 01:15:03,087
How are you, sir? Good evening, sir.

1424
01:15:03,165 --> 01:15:04,427
Good evening, sir. - What
are they doing in the bathtub?

1425
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:06,491
I'll tell you later, first
help them out. Help them first.

1426
01:15:06,969 --> 01:15:08,027
Sir, you please come. Come, sir.

1427
01:15:08,103 --> 01:15:09,297
Sir, it is a police matter.
- What police matter?

1428
01:15:11,974 --> 01:15:17,640
Come on. Benny, what's
wrong with you? - Nothing.

1429
01:15:17,713 --> 01:15:19,044
Tell me, what's the matter?

1430
01:15:19,982 --> 01:15:22,314
Will this hotel
shut down? - No. Why?

1431
01:15:24,052 --> 01:15:25,644
There was a police raid yesterday.

1432
01:15:25,721 --> 01:15:27,985
Forget it. This has not
happened for the first time.

1433
01:15:28,056 --> 01:15:29,114
You come with me. Don't worry.

1434
01:15:29,191 --> 01:15:32,922
You see, there'll be nothing in the
papers about this tomorrow either.

1435
01:15:33,195 --> 01:15:36,255
Ronnie, it looks
like a red light area.

1436
01:15:36,331 --> 01:15:37,992
So what? This is a five star hotel.

1437
01:15:38,066 --> 01:15:39,328
You get permission
to do all this here.

1438
01:15:39,401 --> 01:15:40,993
And listen, don't call it a red
light area, it doesn't sound good.

1439
01:15:41,069 --> 01:15:42,593
Call it escort service.

1440
01:15:43,005 --> 01:15:45,599
If you call these girls.. in
Hindi.. - No, I understood.

1441
01:15:45,674 --> 01:15:46,868
It doesn't sound good, does it?
Escort service sounds good.

1442
01:15:47,676 --> 01:15:48,938
If somebody calls you
a boy who rings a bell..

1443
01:15:49,011 --> 01:15:51,206
it won't sound good, will it?

1444
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:53,407
Bellboy sounds really good,
doesn't it? Right? Let's go.

1445
01:15:53,949 --> 01:15:55,416
And listen.. this is a five star.

1446
01:15:55,684 --> 01:15:58,152
The more filth, the
more stars you get here.

1447
01:16:00,956 --> 01:16:02,947
What happened? Did you like
the joke? - No.. that one..

1448
01:16:03,025 --> 01:16:05,084
Which one? - "The
boy who rings a bell"..

1449
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:06,422
Did you like it so much? - Yes.

1450
01:16:06,495 --> 01:16:07,484
Come on.

1451
01:16:09,164 --> 01:16:10,631
Benny. Benny. - What?

1452
01:16:10,699 --> 01:16:14,294
What's written here? A
renowned hotel was raided.

1453
01:16:14,970 --> 01:16:19,373
Benny, I hope this is not
your hotel? - Five star?

1454
01:16:19,441 --> 01:16:22,171
Have they published
the name of the hotel?

1455
01:16:23,378 --> 01:16:27,906
No, there's no name.
- Your brain is like a ladies bar.

1456
01:16:28,517 --> 01:16:29,575
How can you accuse like this?

1457
01:16:29,651 --> 01:16:31,380
No, I just asked you.

1458
01:16:32,254 --> 01:16:36,452
Babloo, this is a five star.
It is not your.. bar.

1459
01:16:37,593 --> 01:16:39,060
Give that to me.. - Why?

1460
01:16:39,127 --> 01:16:40,526
I need to clean the mirror.
Give that to me.

1461
01:16:43,332 --> 01:16:45,266
You'll clean the
mirror with today's paper.

1462
01:16:53,609 --> 01:16:56,601
Is this a mirror? - I had come
to dry this.. five star here..

1463
01:16:56,678 --> 01:17:00,341
..sorry, towel. - Hurry up.
It's time for Ranvir's film.

1464
01:17:00,415 --> 01:17:01,939
Everyone must be waiting.

1465
01:17:02,017 --> 01:17:03,541
I was trying to see
the show's timing.

1466
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:04,608
What's the name of the movie?

1467
01:17:04,953 --> 01:17:07,285
'Bhaujai Ki Saugand,
Tohara Ke Gaad Ke Rakhdaye.'

1468
01:17:07,356 --> 01:17:08,618
I am not asking the dialogue,
tell me the name.

1469
01:17:08,690 --> 01:17:10,555
You tell me the
movie's name. Tell me.

1470
01:17:10,626 --> 01:17:12,150
'Bhaujai Ki Saugand.'

1471
01:17:15,030 --> 01:17:18,022
You read the rest on
the poster. Hurry up.

1472
01:17:23,305 --> 01:17:25,296
Sorry. Sorry. I got late.

1473
01:17:26,642 --> 01:17:28,166
Hema.. what are you doing?

1474
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:33,905
Our hero is here. - What an entry!

1475
01:17:37,653 --> 01:17:43,319
'Thakur, I've come back
from the city to retaliate.'

1476
01:17:44,993 --> 01:17:46,858
'I'll not spare you now.'

1477
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:53,868
"Till when will you
torment me like this?"

1478
01:18:02,010 --> 01:18:02,999
He's dancing so well. - Sit.

1479
01:18:05,113 --> 01:18:09,106
"Be sure of that."

1480
01:18:11,953 --> 01:18:15,286
'l swear on my sister-in-law,
I'll not spare you.'

1481
01:18:19,428 --> 01:18:22,420
Hit him.. - He's
looking so handsome.

1482
01:18:22,497 --> 01:18:23,623
What a dialogue
delivery it was! Look.

1483
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:26,031
He's come again with
a stick in his hand.

1484
01:18:26,101 --> 01:18:29,901
He's looking so handsome.
Just like a hero. Great.

1485
01:18:30,572 --> 01:18:32,233
Shut up. This is not
your father's house.

1486
01:18:32,307 --> 01:18:34,366
Is this your mother's house?
Mind it. Sit down.

1487
01:18:34,443 --> 01:18:36,570
'Thakur, your time is up today.'

1488
01:18:37,512 --> 01:18:40,913
'Forgive me. - Today,
I'll count your sins.'

1489
01:18:41,450 --> 01:18:44,908
'No, you are like my sister-in-law.
please forgive me.'

1490
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:46,509
'please, forgive me.'

1491
01:18:54,529 --> 01:18:56,588
Yes, I told you.. I am ready..

1492
01:18:58,066 --> 01:19:00,933
But.. But I want Rs. 3 lakhs.

1493
01:19:01,002 --> 01:19:02,526
You have an expensive entry fee.

1494
01:19:03,071 --> 01:19:04,129
Okay, I'll give you Rs. 3 lakhs.

1495
01:19:05,207 --> 01:19:07,937
Okay, so I'll come tonight itself.

1496
01:19:08,009 --> 01:19:10,000
You just tell me when
and where to come.

1497
01:19:10,078 --> 01:19:11,340
You will give me Rs.
3 lakhs, won't you?

1498
01:19:11,413 --> 01:19:13,278
Rs. 3 lakhs for one night?
Won't do.

1499
01:19:13,548 --> 01:19:15,345
I'll take you to
Lonavala for three nights.

1500
01:19:15,951 --> 01:19:17,418
I'll give you Rs. 1
lakh after every night.

1501
01:19:17,486 --> 01:19:19,215
Down payment. Tell me,
do you agree with it?

1502
01:19:19,621 --> 01:19:23,079
Yes, yes.. I am ready.
I'll be there.

1503
01:19:25,694 --> 01:19:27,958
I thought you were
different from the others.

1504
01:19:28,563 --> 01:19:30,895
But I saw as well
as heard you today.

1505
01:19:31,366 --> 01:19:33,300
You are really
different from the others.

1506
01:19:33,568 --> 01:19:35,035
You are doing all this stealthily?

1507
01:19:37,506 --> 01:19:41,909
Got a call from the village.
father is in the lCU.

1508
01:19:43,445 --> 01:19:47,245
If he doesn't get
operated in one week.. then..

1509
01:19:49,985 --> 01:19:53,250
I need Rs. 3 lakhs. Rs. 3 lakhs.

1510
01:19:57,192 --> 01:19:59,251
I can do anything
for mother and father.

1511
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:08,061
"My dreams are so cheap, is
there someone who can buy them?"

1512
01:20:08,403 --> 01:20:11,133
"Anyone can buy it."

1513
01:20:11,206 --> 01:20:14,266
"The path is lost, the
destination is too far."

1514
01:20:14,342 --> 01:20:17,140
"What is my destiny like?"

1515
01:20:17,212 --> 01:20:20,147
"What is my destiny like?"

1516
01:20:22,217 --> 01:20:25,084
"Oh, God, who cursed me?"

1517
01:20:25,153 --> 01:20:28,020
"Oh, God, even prayers don't help."

1518
01:20:28,089 --> 01:20:31,024
"Oh, God, who cursed me?"

1519
01:20:31,092 --> 01:20:34,152
"Oh, God, even prayers don't help."

1520
01:20:34,229 --> 01:20:38,029
I had kept this Rs. 10000
with the manager as savings.

1521
01:20:38,099 --> 01:20:41,364
Use them for your work.

1522
01:20:43,438 --> 01:20:46,965
And try saving
yourself as much as possible..

1523
01:20:48,176 --> 01:20:49,973
..but don't choose this way.

1524
01:20:53,448 --> 01:20:56,906
No, Babloo, I think even
the Lord wants the same.

1525
01:21:00,655 --> 01:21:01,644
No.

1526
01:21:03,391 --> 01:21:05,325
Hey, pedora, what are you doing?

1527
01:21:05,994 --> 01:21:07,461
Brother, don't stop me today.

1528
01:21:07,529 --> 01:21:10,521
I've earned a lot for your
Ghungroo ladies bar. please.

1529
01:21:25,614 --> 01:21:30,074
If Babloo can help her..
can't we help her as well?

1530
01:22:12,327 --> 01:22:16,263
Hi, baby. Just a reminder
for tomorrow. - Of course.

1531
01:22:16,731 --> 01:22:19,996
How can I forget?
Candle light dinner, fixed.

1532
01:22:20,268 --> 01:22:22,133
Bye, love, take care. - Bye.

1533
01:22:22,671 --> 01:22:25,606
Who's this? - Boyfriend.

1534
01:22:26,207 --> 01:22:27,196
What?

1535
01:22:28,276 --> 01:22:29,937
You got a new boyfriend? - Yes.

1536
01:22:30,412 --> 01:22:32,004
He owns a bike? - No.

1537
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:33,069
He owns a car.

1538
01:22:34,482 --> 01:22:35,471
Yes.

1539
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:41,154
I brought you here to
show you the surprise.

1540
01:22:44,492 --> 01:22:46,619
This is 'Tera' (Yours)? - We are
on floor number 'Tera' (Thirteen).

1541
01:22:46,695 --> 01:22:50,028
Not the number. - Then?
- Does this belong to you?

1542
01:22:50,098 --> 01:22:54,296
No, this is our flat. 2
BHK flat. But on rent.

1543
01:22:54,369 --> 01:22:55,961
Actually I've spoken to my parents.

1544
01:22:56,037 --> 01:22:58,028
They want me to settle
down at the earliest.

1545
01:22:58,440 --> 01:23:02,433
So this is my
surprise number 2. Wow.

1546
01:23:05,313 --> 01:23:09,374
I can't marry you..
- What? But why?

1547
01:23:11,586 --> 01:23:15,522
You know why I am working
in this ladies bar, right?

1548
01:23:17,392 --> 01:23:19,053
No matter what happens in my life..

1549
01:23:19,995 --> 01:23:21,587
..I want to educate my siblings.

1550
01:23:22,197 --> 01:23:23,994
I want to bear all their expenses.

1551
01:23:24,065 --> 01:23:27,262
Come on, lsha, don't your
siblings mean anything to me?

1552
01:23:27,602 --> 01:23:30,935
You don't get tensed. I'm there.
I'll manage everything.

1553
01:23:33,675 --> 01:23:37,475
Every month's expense
is more than Rs. 50000.

1554
01:23:39,014 --> 01:23:44,281
You'll manage in the beginning, but
you'll feel it is a burden later on.

1555
01:23:46,488 --> 01:23:49,946
So what do you want? You
want to stay in that muck..

1556
01:23:50,025 --> 01:23:54,155
..that filthy place, in that dirt,
between those bad people..

1557
01:23:54,229 --> 01:23:56,356
..and ruin your whole life?

1558
01:23:57,632 --> 01:23:59,964
Nowadays, I can see my
brother Dheeraj's monthly fees..

1559
01:24:00,035 --> 01:24:02,560
..in all those dirty looks.

1560
01:24:04,172 --> 01:24:06,640
I can see my sister
Laado's college degree.

1561
01:24:07,509 --> 01:24:10,501
My little brother and sisters..
Akash, Rinku, and preeti..

1562
01:24:10,578 --> 01:24:12,443
I see their tuition fees.

1563
01:24:12,981 --> 01:24:17,509
But do you know how much my parents
are forcing me to get married?

1564
01:24:18,987 --> 01:24:21,512
You get married then.
You get married.

1565
01:24:22,657 --> 01:24:25,990
If not me, somebody else
will become Mrs. Ravi Kishen.

1566
01:24:26,261 --> 01:24:29,594
What rubbish? What are you saying?
- I can't marry you.

1567
01:24:32,133 --> 01:24:35,466
But, yes. I want something
from you. Will you give it to me?

1568
01:24:36,004 --> 01:24:38,939
What do you want? Tell me? - This.

1569
01:24:39,274 --> 01:24:41,333
What will you do
with this nuptial chain?

1570
01:24:43,545 --> 01:24:47,140
I'll see this daily and
show it to others, too.

1571
01:24:48,083 --> 01:24:51,883
That there was one guy who
wanted to spend not one night..

1572
01:24:52,487 --> 01:24:54,216
..but his whole life with me.

1573
01:24:56,357 --> 01:24:58,291
You refused Ranvir for marriage?

1574
01:25:00,095 --> 01:25:03,963
pedora, you know.. we have
so many responsibilities..

1575
01:25:04,032 --> 01:25:09,095
..in our lives that we
can't think of ourselves.

1576
01:25:10,038 --> 01:25:11,972
Our siblings should
become something. That's it.

1577
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:13,905
We don't want anything else.

1578
01:25:14,709 --> 01:25:18,509
And anyway.. I like
dreaming for others.

1579
01:25:20,515 --> 01:25:23,916
I am happy that
Ranvir's dream is coming true.

1580
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:28,248
Shall I tell you something?
The first time I came here..

1581
01:25:28,323 --> 01:25:32,589
..I was feeling so ashamed..
that what a place I'm working at!

1582
01:25:32,660 --> 01:25:35,060
Which kind of girls
am I working with?

1583
01:25:35,330 --> 01:25:39,528
But after meeting you.. I can
tell you one thing for sure.

1584
01:25:40,401 --> 01:25:43,529
That the way you are
struggling in your life..

1585
01:25:44,506 --> 01:25:45,200
..in such an environment,
I am proud of you all.

1586
01:25:46,073 --> 01:25:54,003
"You are not in your senses.
Your youth is intoxicating."

1587
01:25:54,081 --> 01:25:57,016
"It's not.. It's not your fault."

1588
01:25:57,084 --> 01:25:59,484
"You are always intoxicating."

1589
01:25:59,553 --> 01:26:01,521
"You are a
damsel." - Come and dance.

1590
01:26:01,588 --> 01:26:06,082
Not on the stage. Not on the stage.
Sit here. - Hey, little friend..

1591
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:09,427
You all have a seat.
Calm down. Sit comfortably.

1592
01:26:10,097 --> 01:26:14,033
The singers are singing here. You
just listen to their songs quietly.

1593
01:26:14,101 --> 01:26:15,693
They are sitting quietly.
- Make them sit quietly.

1594
01:26:15,769 --> 01:26:17,236
Otherwise, I'll teach them a lesson.

1595
01:26:17,304 --> 01:26:19,033
"Lover is your name."

1596
01:26:19,106 --> 01:26:21,404
"Your job is to steal hearts."

1597
01:26:21,475 --> 01:26:24,239
"Hold my hands."

1598
01:26:24,311 --> 01:26:26,643
"You are defamed here."

1599
01:26:26,713 --> 01:26:28,044
Come on, sir. Have a seat. Come on.

1600
01:26:28,115 --> 01:26:29,548
"You are a damsel."

1601
01:26:29,616 --> 01:26:32,050
"You are a damsel."

1602
01:26:32,519 --> 01:26:35,044
Don't let go off her hand.
- Let go off me.

1603
01:26:35,388 --> 01:26:38,380
You shouldn't touch her.
- You tell me, what do I touch?

1604
01:26:39,392 --> 01:26:40,723
Sir, dancing isn't
allowed here. Sit.

1605
01:26:41,128 --> 01:26:42,186
Why are you messing with me for
these characterless women?

1606
01:26:42,262 --> 01:26:43,251
Hit him. Hit that rascal.

1607
01:26:45,332 --> 01:26:46,492
What did you say?
-Characterless women..

1608
01:26:47,067 --> 01:26:49,126
How dare you say that?
How dare you?

1609
01:26:49,202 --> 01:26:52,103
Who did you call as
characterless women? Babloo.

1610
01:26:53,573 --> 01:26:56,064
You come with me. -
You don't know us.

1611
01:26:56,143 --> 01:26:58,077
Take them inside. Come on.

1612
01:26:58,145 --> 01:27:00,079
Throw them out, come on.

1613
01:27:00,547 --> 01:27:04,005
Let go off me. Let go.

1614
01:27:04,684 --> 01:27:06,447
We'll surely teach you a lesson.

1615
01:27:09,422 --> 01:27:11,617
Come on, move. - Let go off me.

1616
01:27:11,691 --> 01:27:15,024
Let go off me. - Suresh,
close the door first.

1617
01:27:15,362 --> 01:27:17,387
Close the door. I'll thrash them.

1618
01:27:20,233 --> 01:27:21,598
How dare they bash up our boys?

1619
01:27:22,536 --> 01:27:26,472
Do they have a license to thrash
anyone who commits a mistake?

1620
01:27:27,641 --> 01:27:29,040
The people working in
some crummy Ghungroo bar..

1621
01:27:29,109 --> 01:27:31,043
..Iocated on Goregaon link road..

1622
01:27:31,111 --> 01:27:32,703
..bashed up our boys?

1623
01:27:33,113 --> 01:27:34,341
Beaten them up like dogs!

1624
01:27:34,648 --> 01:27:38,049
You'll give a statement to the police
that you all had been to the bar..

1625
01:27:38,118 --> 01:27:41,713
..but you didn't even
touch the bar girls.

1626
01:27:44,124 --> 01:27:47,992
But even after the 9:30 deadline,
when the bargirls were getting..

1627
01:27:48,061 --> 01:27:51,997
..physical with the guests publicly..
you four tried to capture..

1628
01:27:52,065 --> 01:27:57,594
..their illegal activities
on your cell phone camera.

1629
01:27:58,538 --> 01:28:03,339
That's it. They all started
beating you up brutally after that.

1630
01:28:13,486 --> 01:28:16,182
I haven't seen you before.
Who are you?

1631
01:28:17,090 --> 01:28:20,150
I am Alok's friend. I've recently
shifted here with my parents.

1632
01:28:21,094 --> 01:28:25,030
Oh, your mother must be
worried hearing all this, right?

1633
01:28:25,098 --> 01:28:28,693
Ask her to relax. - Okay, ma'am.

1634
01:28:30,036 --> 01:28:34,234
And also tell her that you
won't be able to come home tonight.

1635
01:28:34,574 --> 01:28:35,700
Why are you standing sullen?

1636
01:28:36,643 --> 01:28:37,701
Jail is a common thing.

1637
01:28:37,777 --> 01:28:39,335
It has been happening since
the freedom fights era.

1638
01:28:39,613 --> 01:28:42,241
These days, everything is
'legular'.. Ieg.. - Regular.

1639
01:28:42,315 --> 01:28:44,715
Yes, it is regular. Even
actors come to jail nowadays.

1640
01:28:45,385 --> 01:28:48,377
Stop lecturing me now. - No,
I am not lecturing you.

1641
01:28:48,455 --> 01:28:51,049
I am happy and feeling proud.
I am celebrating.

1642
01:28:51,324 --> 01:28:54,020
You are actually a
ladies bar waiter now.

1643
01:28:54,094 --> 01:28:56,062
You've completed the formality of
going to jail after being in a brawl.

1644
01:28:56,129 --> 01:28:57,596
Babloo, you've
finished your graduation now.

1645
01:28:57,664 --> 01:28:59,655
Babloo has passed. I want to
tell this news to everyone.

1646
01:28:59,733 --> 01:29:02,600
Sir.. Brother, please come
here for a minute. - What is it?

1647
01:29:02,669 --> 01:29:04,500
This is Babloo. He
works in the ladies bar.

1648
01:29:04,571 --> 01:29:05,663
Today he finished graduation..
- So, what do I do?

1649
01:29:07,073 --> 01:29:10,201
Sir.. this is Babloo. He
works in a ladies bar.

1650
01:29:10,277 --> 01:29:12,507
There's a filthy and third class
bar named Ghungroo ladies bar.

1651
01:29:12,579 --> 01:29:13,637
He works in that bar.

1652
01:29:13,713 --> 01:29:15,340
Today, he landed up in
jail after having a fight.

1653
01:29:15,415 --> 01:29:16,473
He completed his graduation today.

1654
01:29:16,549 --> 01:29:18,039
Shake hands with him. Shake hands.

1655
01:29:18,118 --> 01:29:20,450
Mr. Raju is the manager
of Ghungroo ladies bar.

1656
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:23,421
Oh, God.. - This is Benny,
isn't it? Take it easy.

1657
01:29:23,490 --> 01:29:26,459
Sir.. - Going to jail
is common in our line.

1658
01:29:27,560 --> 01:29:28,993
This is a daily job for us.

1659
01:29:29,496 --> 01:29:31,293
You do one thing,
meet me in the evening.

1660
01:29:31,364 --> 01:29:33,559
I'll finish the paper work
and return. - Okay, goodbye.

1661
01:29:33,633 --> 01:29:35,430
You said what I wanted to say..

1662
01:29:36,569 --> 01:29:39,629
He said it was 'legular'.. Iegu..
- Regular. - It was regular here.

1663
01:29:39,706 --> 01:29:41,697
Very good. I am very happy.
My mind is at peace now.

1664
01:29:48,048 --> 01:29:52,542
Our NGO team has known the inside
story of these ladies bars of Mumbai.

1665
01:29:53,186 --> 01:29:55,211
The law is being broken.

1666
01:29:55,655 --> 01:29:59,523
They dance all night and they find
new ways to attract the customers.

1667
01:30:00,327 --> 01:30:01,919
Have some. please.

1668
01:30:03,396 --> 01:30:08,163
Till when will we pretend to be
ignorant though we know everything?

1669
01:30:09,469 --> 01:30:11,300
They are exposing
themselves in public.

1670
01:30:13,073 --> 01:30:15,268
Gentlemen, now it is time.

1671
01:30:15,342 --> 01:30:18,004
We all have to get
together and expose this..

1672
01:30:18,078 --> 01:30:20,444
..dirty network of the ladies bars.

1673
01:30:21,581 --> 01:30:22,673
Yes, gentlemen. She's right.

1674
01:30:23,350 --> 01:30:25,011
I mean, this vulgarity, this
obscenity, this exposure..

1675
01:30:25,085 --> 01:30:27,679
We won't tolerate it more.

1676
01:30:27,754 --> 01:30:29,346
You have a high
position in the society.

1677
01:30:29,422 --> 01:30:31,014
I am sure if you all get
together and protest..

1678
01:30:31,091 --> 01:30:32,558
..people will get awareness..
I am sure..

1679
01:30:33,093 --> 01:30:34,219
Thank you, Mr. Negi.

1680
01:30:34,294 --> 01:30:36,262
Mrs. Tejani, shall I assume
that the party is confirmed?

1681
01:30:36,563 --> 01:30:37,689
Of course, Mr. Negi.

1682
01:30:37,764 --> 01:30:39,095
Yes.

1683
01:30:39,165 --> 01:30:41,133
Yes, alright. Enjoy yourself.
- Thank you.

1684
01:30:41,568 --> 01:30:43,092
Nikhil, the party is
confirmed on 15th..

1685
01:30:43,169 --> 01:30:44,261
So we have to get together.

1686
01:30:49,476 --> 01:30:52,343
I want all the ladies bars to
shut down as soon as possible.

1687
01:30:52,412 --> 01:30:54,141
And give the report to me.

1688
01:30:54,214 --> 01:30:57,308
If you need any help,
take it from our department.

1689
01:30:57,384 --> 01:30:58,442
Shut it down as soon as possible.

1690
01:30:58,518 --> 01:31:00,349
This is not good for our society.

1691
01:31:00,420 --> 01:31:01,648
You don't know who I am.

1692
01:31:03,056 --> 01:31:06,219
If I make one call,
they'll come and kill you.

1693
01:31:07,193 --> 01:31:09,991
Rascal. Stop your melodrama.

1694
01:31:10,530 --> 01:31:12,464
Scoundrel, I don't
want the ladies bars.

1695
01:31:14,334 --> 01:31:16,393
Come on. Come on.

1696
01:31:16,669 --> 01:31:18,102
Don't push.
- Sit there.

1697
01:31:21,541 --> 01:31:22,530
Move the vehicle.

1698
01:31:45,031 --> 01:31:46,020
Come on, move.

1699
01:31:46,099 --> 01:31:48,966
Come on. Come on.

1700
01:31:49,035 --> 01:31:51,629
Get everyone. Get everyone.

1701
01:31:51,971 --> 01:31:54,405
Come on. Get everyone.
Go and sit in the car.

1702
01:31:54,474 --> 01:31:56,101
Don't act smart. Come on. - Come on.

1703
01:31:56,176 --> 01:31:57,268
Hurry up. Come on. Come on. Come on.

1704
01:31:57,343 --> 01:31:58,901
Wretch woman was
hiding inside. Come on.

1705
01:32:03,383 --> 01:32:04,441
What happened,
Brother? - What happened?

1706
01:32:04,517 --> 01:32:05,575
What happened inside?
- There is nothing to worry about.

1707
01:32:05,652 --> 01:32:06,641
Everything has been settled.

1708
01:32:06,986 --> 01:32:08,977
You all will be able
to go home in an hour.

1709
01:32:09,055 --> 01:32:10,113
Thank you, Brother.

1710
01:32:10,190 --> 01:32:11,452
Thank you, Brother.
- Thank you. Thank you.

1711
01:32:11,524 --> 01:32:12,513
Thank you for what? - Good.

1712
01:32:13,059 --> 01:32:17,257
I charge you guys 40 %% protection
money to resolve such issues.

1713
01:32:17,597 --> 01:32:18,586
Come on, relax now.

1714
01:32:18,998 --> 01:32:20,488
I will go and settle
other things. - Okay. Fie.

1715
01:32:20,567 --> 01:32:22,000
Okay. - Thank you.
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1716
01:32:22,068 --> 01:32:23,933
It's so.. - It has
become a daily thing now.

1717
01:32:24,337 --> 01:32:26,931
They take money and
yet come to arrest us.

1718
01:32:27,273 --> 01:32:29,070
Then they make us wait for
5 hours here. - Come in.

1719
01:32:29,142 --> 01:32:30,131
Come on, sit over here.

1720
01:32:34,180 --> 01:32:36,978
They said 1 hour, but I wonder
how long they will take. Rascals.

1721
01:32:41,421 --> 01:32:42,410
Brother..

1722
01:32:44,190 --> 01:32:45,350
Why is that girl here?

1723
01:32:46,125 --> 01:32:47,114
Who, she?

1724
01:32:47,961 --> 01:32:50,486
I caught her backless on the
backseat at Lokhandwala back road.

1725
01:32:50,563 --> 01:32:51,621
What are you saying?

1726
01:32:51,698 --> 01:32:53,222
She was busy with a guy.

1727
01:32:53,633 --> 01:32:55,362
The guy ran away. I caught her.

1728
01:32:56,336 --> 01:32:58,270
Hey, hi-fi, what were
you saying the other day?

1729
01:32:59,372 --> 01:33:01,431
"public property
talking of being personal".

1730
01:33:03,376 --> 01:33:05,901
Now look, who has
become public property.

1731
01:33:07,347 --> 01:33:08,336
Stop here.

1732
01:33:10,116 --> 01:33:11,174
How much?

1733
01:33:11,251 --> 01:33:12,240
Brother.

1734
01:33:15,588 --> 01:33:17,579
The girl there.. Her..

1735
01:33:18,324 --> 01:33:20,383
Anyhow get her out of here.
please, Brother.

1736
01:33:21,160 --> 01:33:22,923
I'll pay whatever it
takes to get her out.

1737
01:33:23,196 --> 01:33:24,254
please, Brother. - You guys..

1738
01:33:24,330 --> 01:33:25,388
please. please.
please. please. please.

1739
01:33:25,465 --> 01:33:26,523
Okay, I'll do something. Come on.

1740
01:33:26,599 --> 01:33:27,930
Oh, thank you, Brother.

1741
01:33:28,535 --> 01:33:30,400
I'll talk to him.
You go and sit there.

1742
01:33:31,304 --> 01:33:32,362
Sir.. - Ria.

1743
01:33:32,438 --> 01:33:33,996
What I am saying is..
- Yes, tell me.

1744
01:33:34,073 --> 01:33:35,131
The girl sitting back there..

1745
01:33:35,208 --> 01:33:40,407
Aunty.. I have called her here.

1746
01:33:41,281 --> 01:33:45,615
Actually, our ladies bar was
raided today and.. I got caught.

1747
01:33:46,953 --> 01:33:48,944
And these guys said that
they will leave me only..

1748
01:33:49,022 --> 01:33:51,490
..when I call two
people who can vouch for me.

1749
01:33:52,225 --> 01:33:54,523
Aunty, I don't know
anyone other than you two.

1750
01:33:55,295 --> 01:33:58,196
Why, dear? Why do
you do such a thing?

1751
01:34:00,233 --> 01:34:01,291
Stop doing it.

1752
01:34:01,701 --> 01:34:04,033
Look at my daughter Ria.

1753
01:34:04,103 --> 01:34:07,903
You can also work at a
nice place like she does.

1754
01:34:08,975 --> 01:34:09,964
Your job is done.

1755
01:34:10,243 --> 01:34:12,006
He is Mr. Raju.

1756
01:34:12,078 --> 01:34:13,443
Our ladies bar's manager.

1757
01:34:13,980 --> 01:34:16,141
He will handle the
rest of the things.

1758
01:34:16,583 --> 01:34:18,517
You both can leave now. Right?

1759
01:34:19,586 --> 01:34:20,985
Thanks. Thank you for coming.

1760
01:34:21,054 --> 01:34:22,043
Thank you, Ria, for coming.

1761
01:34:24,257 --> 01:34:27,385
Okay, listen, is this
girl from another bar?

1762
01:34:27,460 --> 01:34:29,655
No. She's from another world.

1763
01:34:30,196 --> 01:34:32,664
But her state is just
like mine. Same to same.

1764
01:34:33,232 --> 01:34:35,996
Tell me, Ria. What did you
want to talk to me about?

1765
01:34:39,005 --> 01:34:41,064
Akash, let's get married.

1766
01:34:41,474 --> 01:34:43,374
All of a sudden?

1767
01:34:44,277 --> 01:34:46,973
But.. we had decided to get
married two years later, right?

1768
01:34:48,481 --> 01:34:49,880
I want to get married now.

1769
01:34:50,383 --> 01:34:51,509
Do you have a problem with it?

1770
01:34:53,386 --> 01:34:54,410
I have no problem with it.

1771
01:34:55,254 --> 01:34:56,380
I love you a lot.

1772
01:34:57,957 --> 01:34:59,015
Let something that was supposed..

1773
01:34:59,092 --> 01:35:00,081
..to happen 2 years later,
happen now.

1774
01:35:05,064 --> 01:35:07,362
Babloo, have you
vowed not to talk today?

1775
01:35:07,967 --> 01:35:09,628
You are not talking to Gulabo.

1776
01:35:10,269 --> 01:35:13,033
Do I need to talk
to plants everyday?

1777
01:35:13,506 --> 01:35:15,497
It's not necessary, but
you don't need to get angry.

1778
01:35:17,276 --> 01:35:18,334
Aren't you going to get up?

1779
01:35:18,411 --> 01:35:19,503
Don't you have to go to work?

1780
01:35:20,647 --> 01:35:22,444
I have no work to go to.

1781
01:35:25,985 --> 01:35:29,648
What do you mean? - police cancelled
Ghungroo Ladies Bar's licence.

1782
01:35:30,256 --> 01:35:31,518
What are you saying, Babloo?

1783
01:35:32,225 --> 01:35:36,059
Mr. Raju says that he will
bribe them and get it started.

1784
01:35:36,129 --> 01:35:37,653
But there is no
guarantee as to by when.

1785
01:35:38,264 --> 01:35:39,356
So what will you do now?

1786
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:42,991
Let's see. I'll look for a
job at a railway canteen..

1787
01:35:43,069 --> 01:35:44,127
..or a roadside restaurant.

1788
01:35:44,203 --> 01:35:45,932
What else? - What nonsense
you are talking, Babloo?

1789
01:35:47,206 --> 01:35:48,195
Who am l?

1790
01:35:48,675 --> 01:35:50,267
A five star is
standing in front of you.

1791
01:35:50,610 --> 01:35:51,668
I mean a friend working
in a five star hotel..

1792
01:35:51,744 --> 01:35:52,972
..is standing in
front of you. Got it?

1793
01:35:54,013 --> 01:35:55,241
Talking nonsense.

1794
01:35:56,015 --> 01:35:57,448
When will you take advantage
of such a friend if not now?

1795
01:35:59,018 --> 01:36:00,986
I will get you a job. Get you one.

1796
01:36:01,554 --> 01:36:03,215
Sir, good man, good boy. - Shut up.

1797
01:36:03,289 --> 01:36:04,347
What are you doing over here?

1798
01:36:04,424 --> 01:36:06,551
Sir, madam Sheena
recommended Babloo.

1799
01:36:06,626 --> 01:36:08,116
Just hold on for a second.
- Where is Babloo?

1800
01:36:08,194 --> 01:36:09,593
Babloo is behind.. Down there, sir.

1801
01:36:10,730 --> 01:36:11,958
Oh, he is Babloo?

1802
01:36:12,265 --> 01:36:13,323
Have you worked
anywhere else before?

1803
01:36:13,766 --> 01:36:15,233
Yes, listen.-
Ghungroo Ladies Bar, sir.

1804
01:36:16,035 --> 01:36:17,127
Just hold on for a second.

1805
01:36:17,570 --> 01:36:19,401
What did you say just now?
What 'Ghun'? What?

1806
01:36:19,472 --> 01:36:20,632
Ghungroo Ladies Bar.

1807
01:36:20,707 --> 01:36:22,436
Ghungroo Ladies Bar? - Yes.

1808
01:36:22,508 --> 01:36:24,032
Benny, do you have any brains?

1809
01:36:24,110 --> 01:36:26,169
He does, sir. Sir, he is
very intelligent. Very..

1810
01:36:26,245 --> 01:36:27,644
I am talking about you, not him.

1811
01:36:27,714 --> 01:36:30,046
Do you have any brains?
- What? Yes, I do, sir.

1812
01:36:30,116 --> 01:36:31,378
No, you don't. You
don't have any brains.

1813
01:36:31,651 --> 01:36:32,709
If you had any brains,
you wouldn't..

1814
01:36:32,785 --> 01:36:35,049
..have brought this boy
who works at Ghungroo bar..

1815
01:36:35,121 --> 01:36:36,383
..here in The Mirage.

1816
01:36:36,456 --> 01:36:38,048
Look at this. He is a down-market,
third-class guy..

1817
01:36:38,124 --> 01:36:40,319
..who works at Ghungroo Ladies Bar.

1818
01:36:40,393 --> 01:36:43,385
And look at us. The elite,
the most sophisticated..

1819
01:36:43,463 --> 01:36:45,055
..the cream of the society.
- Thank you, sir.

1820
01:36:45,131 --> 01:36:46,996
I mean.. If you bring
him here henceforth..

1821
01:36:47,066 --> 01:36:49,591
..I will hand him
over to the police.

1822
01:36:49,669 --> 01:36:51,000
Sir, he's my friend. - Shut up.

1823
01:36:51,070 --> 01:36:52,162
I.. I.. - And you
will lose your job.

1824
01:36:52,238 --> 01:36:53,330
Sir. - Get out. - Sir.

1825
01:36:53,406 --> 01:36:54,395
Not from there. - Sir.

1826
01:36:55,007 --> 01:36:56,304
Backdoor. - Okay, sir. - From
the backdoor. - Let's go. Let's go.

1827
01:36:56,375 --> 01:36:57,603
If anyone sees him here.. - Sir.

1828
01:36:57,677 --> 01:36:59,304
They will say that illicit
activities are going on here.

1829
01:36:59,378 --> 01:37:00,606
Illicit activities are
going on here. - Sir.

1830
01:37:00,680 --> 01:37:02,113
Nikhil, I am still on the line.

1831
01:37:03,316 --> 01:37:04,943
"I'll get you a job".

1832
01:37:06,252 --> 01:37:08,311
Let's go. - Babloo.

1833
01:37:09,021 --> 01:37:10,318
Listen. - You don't
have to say sorry.

1834
01:37:10,389 --> 01:37:11,481
I am going through a
bad phase. It happens.

1835
01:37:11,557 --> 01:37:13,320
It's not that. The
backdoor is on that side.

1836
01:37:13,392 --> 01:37:16,623
What door? - The backdoor
is on that side. Let's go.

1837
01:37:19,198 --> 01:37:21,996
Brother, look at the
state of this bar.

1838
01:37:23,369 --> 01:37:25,166
If you want, this
bar can start again.

1839
01:37:26,239 --> 01:37:27,968
I have spoken to
the senior inspector.

1840
01:37:28,708 --> 01:37:29,970
He can get it started.

1841
01:37:31,043 --> 01:37:33,102
Actually he is a philanderer.

1842
01:37:34,113 --> 01:37:37,139
Whenever he gets into the mood,
send girls from here.

1843
01:37:38,484 --> 01:37:41,214
So that your as well
as his work gets done.

1844
01:37:42,054 --> 01:37:45,046
Kamble, I can do illicit business,
but I can't work as..

1845
01:37:45,124 --> 01:37:46,921
..a pimp like you guys.

1846
01:37:48,995 --> 01:37:51,555
These girls used to sell their art
at the dance bar and make a living.

1847
01:37:52,465 --> 01:37:55,366
You stopped that and
forced them to sell their body.

1848
01:37:56,202 --> 01:37:58,329
Now they stand here
quietly and make a living.

1849
01:37:58,404 --> 01:37:59,928
You guys want to stop that as well?

1850
01:38:00,239 --> 01:38:01,467
So that they stand on the streets?

1851
01:38:05,077 --> 01:38:07,671
You guys want to make them
do what they don't want to do.

1852
01:38:09,248 --> 01:38:12,012
No matter how much you
guys try to stop their work..

1853
01:38:12,084 --> 01:38:15,019
..if God wants them
to make a living..

1854
01:38:15,087 --> 01:38:16,952
..then this orchestra
bar will surely start.

1855
01:38:20,226 --> 01:38:22,160
What is this, Ria? You are nervous?

1856
01:38:23,029 --> 01:38:26,089
Just relax. My mom and
dad are very chilled out.

1857
01:38:26,365 --> 01:38:28,162
You will be very
pleased to meet them.

1858
01:38:28,534 --> 01:38:29,967
please come here. Have a seat.

1859
01:38:31,204 --> 01:38:33,195
Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad. This is Ria.

1860
01:38:39,345 --> 01:38:42,974
'The moment I saw you, I have
been living the same fantasy.'

1861
01:38:45,284 --> 01:38:46,216
Have a seat, dear.

1862
01:38:47,453 --> 01:38:49,318
Son, you have got
a fantastic choice.

1863
01:38:51,457 --> 01:38:55,052
Your choice is my choice.

1864
01:38:58,130 --> 01:38:59,995
'l want you. - What?'

1865
01:39:01,400 --> 01:39:02,458
What will you have, dear?

1866
01:39:05,238 --> 01:39:09,265
Nothing, thanks. - No, you
will have to take something.

1867
01:39:12,011 --> 01:39:13,069
'Rs. 1 lakh.'

1868
01:39:13,613 --> 01:39:14,602
'Rs. 2 lakhs.'

1869
01:39:15,548 --> 01:39:16,606
Rs. 3 lakhs.

1870
01:39:18,384 --> 01:39:22,252
Okay, dear, tell me, what
are your plans after marriage?

1871
01:39:22,688 --> 01:39:24,553
You are going to stay
independent or with us?

1872
01:39:26,192 --> 01:39:30,288
Well, I will
prefer you stay with us.

1873
01:39:34,200 --> 01:39:37,567
'Ria, my business
associates are Vishal and Sandeep.'

1874
01:39:37,637 --> 01:39:39,036
'lf you don't mind, just like me..'

1875
01:39:40,039 --> 01:39:42,507
Excuse me. I'll just go to
the washroom and come back.

1876
01:39:47,980 --> 01:39:49,208
Madam.. Madam, your car keys.

1877
01:39:51,450 --> 01:40:00,085
"There are countless
desires in the heart."

1878
01:40:03,329 --> 01:40:11,930
"There are countless
desires in the heart."

1879
01:40:12,238 --> 01:40:17,540
"Why does.."

1880
01:40:18,144 --> 01:40:26,176
"Why does desolation surprise one?"

1881
01:40:30,690 --> 01:40:38,187
"Why is the heart troubled?"

1882
01:40:40,566 --> 01:40:44,161
That's Ria, right? - Yes, ma'am.

1883
01:40:47,540 --> 01:40:49,007
What are you doing, ma'am? - Ria.

1884
01:40:49,308 --> 01:40:50,900
No. please. please. - Ria,
what are you doing?

1885
01:40:51,243 --> 01:40:52,642
What are you doing, Ria?
What happened?

1886
01:40:52,712 --> 01:40:54,543
Ria. Ria, stop it.

1887
01:41:00,586 --> 01:41:03,987
Ria. What happened?

1888
01:41:04,523 --> 01:41:05,615
What is it, Ria?

1889
01:41:05,691 --> 01:41:09,127
"Why is this city deserted?"

1890
01:41:09,462 --> 01:41:17,961
"Why is this city deserted?"

1891
01:41:18,604 --> 01:41:23,371
"Why is everyone.."

1892
01:41:24,443 --> 01:41:32,350
"Why is everyone upset?"

1893
01:41:38,758 --> 01:41:40,225
Let it be, Mr. Kuldeep.

1894
01:41:41,027 --> 01:41:42,153
It was my mistake.

1895
01:41:43,629 --> 01:41:46,291
Okay, will you take
me for lunch today?

1896
01:41:46,365 --> 01:41:49,425
Lunch? You will have
to join me for dinner.

1897
01:41:49,702 --> 01:41:51,567
And a long drive after that.

1898
01:41:51,637 --> 01:41:54,162
And if I feel like, then
straight-drive, cover-drive.

1899
01:41:54,240 --> 01:41:55,298
I will play all the shots.

1900
01:41:55,374 --> 01:41:57,365
Tell me if you are
okay with it. - Okay.

1901
01:42:01,147 --> 01:42:02,910
Mr. Champak, do something.

1902
01:42:03,449 --> 01:42:05,110
I need money desperately.

1903
01:42:05,484 --> 01:42:07,384
Tell me if you can meet
me at my flat in Dahisar.

1904
01:42:08,120 --> 01:42:09,178
I will give you the money.

1905
01:42:09,255 --> 01:42:12,315
police won't let the
ladies bar run so easily.

1906
01:42:12,391 --> 01:42:13,983
What they will do
won't just make it..

1907
01:42:14,060 --> 01:42:15,186
..impossible for you to make money..

1908
01:42:15,261 --> 01:42:17,661
..it will also be difficult
for you manage your conveyance.

1909
01:42:18,531 --> 01:42:20,431
By the way, a lot of
girls are going to Dubai.

1910
01:42:20,499 --> 01:42:22,262
Tell me if you are interested.
I'll make arrangements for you.

1911
01:42:22,535 --> 01:42:25,527
But how can I leave
my kids and go, sir?

1912
01:42:25,604 --> 01:42:27,128
Go for your kids, Hema.

1913
01:42:27,640 --> 01:42:31,098
You know you have only 2-3
years more in this profession.

1914
01:42:31,177 --> 01:42:33,168
Make as much money as you can.

1915
01:42:33,446 --> 01:42:35,209
Go there and dance.

1916
01:42:35,281 --> 01:42:37,146
please private clients.

1917
01:42:37,216 --> 01:42:39,013
There is no other option than that.

1918
01:42:39,085 --> 01:42:46,184
"You don't get happiness
in life at your request."

1919
01:42:46,258 --> 01:42:53,391
"Who snatched the
smile away from my face?"

1920
01:42:53,466 --> 01:42:56,230
"God, who cursed me?"

1921
01:42:56,302 --> 01:42:59,169
"God, prayers aren't working."

1922
01:42:59,238 --> 01:43:02,105
"God, who cursed me?"

1923
01:43:02,174 --> 01:43:05,166
"God, prayers aren't working."

1924
01:43:05,978 --> 01:43:11,041
"There is no peace of
mind even for a moment."

1925
01:43:11,117 --> 01:43:12,106
What is it, dear?

1926
01:43:12,418 --> 01:43:13,407
What happened?

1927
01:43:16,989 --> 01:43:20,288
Mom, I was thinking what
circumstances do to people.

1928
01:43:20,626 --> 01:43:27,998
One storm ruined
our life. 26th July.

1929
01:43:30,503 --> 01:43:33,199
Dad got stuck in the
car all night long.

1930
01:43:36,008 --> 01:43:37,373
Now he is paralyzed.

1931
01:43:38,277 --> 01:43:39,266
He is on a wheel chair.

1932
01:43:40,012 --> 01:43:44,244
Dad stopped walking and our
life came to a standstill, Mom.

1933
01:43:45,551 --> 01:43:47,485
Mom, I had to
discontinue my studies.

1934
01:43:49,555 --> 01:43:51,420
I could've been something else.

1935
01:43:52,124 --> 01:43:55,491
I tried so hard. I
didn't get a job elsewhere.

1936
01:43:56,695 --> 01:44:00,222
But now.. another storm.

1937
01:44:04,103 --> 01:44:05,263
Why us, Mom?

1938
01:44:05,337 --> 01:44:08,431
Don't worry. - Why me, Mommy?

1939
01:44:23,322 --> 01:44:24,653
Hello. - Hello, lsha.

1940
01:44:24,723 --> 01:44:26,315
Any news about when
the bar is reopening?

1941
01:44:26,992 --> 01:44:29,290
No, Soni. No news.

1942
01:44:29,995 --> 01:44:31,587
I am facing financial crises.

1943
01:44:32,198 --> 01:44:34,063
I don't know. My father
asks for money everyday.

1944
01:44:34,133 --> 01:44:35,191
From where should I get the money?

1945
01:44:36,001 --> 01:44:37,525
Okay. - Okay, fine.

1946
01:44:38,437 --> 01:44:39,426
Yes.

1947
01:44:44,176 --> 01:44:48,545
"Why do you look at the face?"

1948
01:44:48,614 --> 01:44:53,278
"Try falling in love with me."

1949
01:44:53,352 --> 01:44:57,618
"Try falling in love with me."

1950
01:44:57,957 --> 01:45:02,553
"Things will change in no time."

1951
01:45:02,628 --> 01:45:07,395
"Stonehearted ones
will also give in."

1952
01:45:07,466 --> 01:45:16,374
"Look how powerful my love is."

1953
01:45:16,642 --> 01:45:21,238
"Look how powerful it is."

1954
01:45:21,313 --> 01:45:25,079
"Why do you look at the face?"

1955
01:45:25,150 --> 01:45:28,051
Father.. - "Try falling in
love with me." - Go, dear. Go.

1956
01:45:28,120 --> 01:45:29,212
Go and meet him.

1957
01:45:29,588 --> 01:45:31,453
There is no harm is seeing him.

1958
01:45:32,091 --> 01:45:33,388
But keep one thing in mind.

1959
01:45:33,659 --> 01:45:35,524
Don't fall in love with him.

1960
01:45:36,328 --> 01:45:37,920
You can shop and give him the bill.

1961
01:45:38,731 --> 01:45:44,431
Dear, you are not
destined for love and marriage.

1962
01:45:45,004 --> 01:45:47,131
Why do you think about it? Yes?

1963
01:45:48,007 --> 01:45:54,003
Go. - Father, I was having difficulty
deciding since a long time..

1964
01:45:54,079 --> 01:45:58,277
..as to what is worse,
my destiny or my father.

1965
01:46:00,419 --> 01:46:03,547
This is The Mirage's
project file, Mr. Waghmare.

1966
01:46:04,023 --> 01:46:06,184
If you give clearance, there
will be one Mirage in Goa, too.

1967
01:46:08,160 --> 01:46:09,149
Sweets for you.

1968
01:46:09,461 --> 01:46:10,951
Let it be, Negi.

1969
01:46:11,297 --> 01:46:14,425
These sweets have made us diabetic.

1970
01:46:15,100 --> 01:46:18,365
This time we don't want sweets,
we want cream.

1971
01:46:18,704 --> 01:46:19,693
What say, Narayan?

1972
01:46:20,172 --> 01:46:23,505
Yes, I have heard a
lot about your hotel.

1973
01:46:23,575 --> 01:46:26,976
Yes. - How about if we get
to enjoy some, too? - Yes.

1974
01:46:27,346 --> 01:46:31,043
This time, to clear the file,
we need a party..

1975
01:46:31,116 --> 01:46:33,107
..where there is
good whiskey. - Yes.

1976
01:46:33,385 --> 01:46:36,252
And great.. girls.

1977
01:46:36,322 --> 01:46:37,983
This is very wrong, sir.

1978
01:46:38,657 --> 01:46:39,646
He's my friend, sir.

1979
01:46:40,359 --> 01:46:43,123
How can I tell a friend
to do such a thing, sir?

1980
01:46:43,529 --> 01:46:44,587
Just hold on for a second.
- Sir, that..

1981
01:46:44,663 --> 01:46:45,721
He is your friend, right? - Sir.

1982
01:46:45,798 --> 01:46:48,426
Can't one friend do this
much to save his friend's job?

1983
01:46:48,500 --> 01:46:50,525
Sir, he's a dear friend.
I.. Sir.. - I know. I know.

1984
01:46:52,504 --> 01:46:54,199
My job is.. - At risk.

1985
01:46:54,540 --> 01:46:55,598
No personal vendetta.

1986
01:46:55,674 --> 01:46:58,074
Look, I have to please my seniors.

1987
01:46:58,344 --> 01:47:00,335
Like in this case you
will have to please me.

1988
01:47:00,412 --> 01:47:01,674
Your friend will have to please you.

1989
01:47:01,747 --> 01:47:03,009
We have to see each other,
you know.

1990
01:47:03,082 --> 01:47:04,208
It's.. It's like
give and take, you know.

1991
01:47:04,483 --> 01:47:07,008
Listen, if this job
is done, I will give..

1992
01:47:07,086 --> 01:47:10,249
..your friend a nice
job in this hotel.

1993
01:47:10,322 --> 01:47:15,419
And if not, then you
will lose your job.

1994
01:47:16,095 --> 01:47:17,153
Yes, Nikhil, tell me.

1995
01:47:17,229 --> 01:47:18,218
Yes. Yes.

1996
01:47:23,268 --> 01:47:24,599
Tell us, Babloo. What is it?

1997
01:47:25,037 --> 01:47:27,301
Tell us, what is it? Why
aren't you saying anything?

1998
01:47:28,173 --> 01:47:29,435
Come on, man. Tell us.

1999
01:47:29,708 --> 01:47:30,970
Speak up.

2000
01:47:32,044 --> 01:47:33,033
Hey..

2001
01:47:38,250 --> 01:47:44,587
Benny's seniors are going
to have a party in Lonavala.

2002
01:47:46,225 --> 01:47:48,523
They need dancers.

2003
01:47:48,994 --> 01:47:50,188
To sing and dance.

2004
01:47:50,262 --> 01:47:51,923
They will pay well.

2005
01:47:56,135 --> 01:47:59,002
Good, isn't it?
- Look, whatever l..

2006
01:47:59,071 --> 01:48:00,368
Forgive me if you have felt bad.

2007
01:48:00,639 --> 01:48:03,073
Stupid, why are you apologizing?

2008
01:48:03,142 --> 01:48:07,078
You have brought us a
source to make some money.

2009
01:48:07,146 --> 01:48:09,011
But I don't know what
kind of a place it is..

2010
01:48:09,081 --> 01:48:10,139
..and what kind of people they are.

2011
01:48:10,215 --> 01:48:12,183
It's an unknown place.
It's obvious to get scared.

2012
01:48:12,251 --> 01:48:14,310
We can't sit idle either.

2013
01:48:14,386 --> 01:48:16,251
We have to run our
households as well.

2014
01:48:16,321 --> 01:48:18,152
Yes, lsha. You are right.

2015
01:48:18,424 --> 01:48:19,686
Babloo, why worry about us?

2016
01:48:20,259 --> 01:48:22,693
First destiny made
us work in a bar..

2017
01:48:22,761 --> 01:48:26,094
..and now the government
forced us to the streets.

2018
01:48:26,165 --> 01:48:27,393
You are right, Soni.

2019
01:48:28,367 --> 01:48:34,237
Now we are being forced to
do what we didn't want to do.

2020
01:48:54,993 --> 01:48:56,984
"l am wearing bangles and earrings."

2021
01:48:57,062 --> 01:48:58,586
"Give me a high-five."
"Give me a high-five."

2022
01:48:58,664 --> 01:49:00,427
"l am beautiful and agile."

2023
01:49:00,499 --> 01:49:02,296
"Give me a high-five."
"Give me a high-five."

2024
01:49:02,367 --> 01:49:04,232
"l am wearing bangles and earrings."

2025
01:49:04,303 --> 01:49:05,998
"Give me a high-five."
"Give me a high-five."

2026
01:49:06,071 --> 01:49:08,005
"l am beautiful and agile."

2027
01:49:08,073 --> 01:49:09,665
"Give me a high-five."
"Give me a high-five."

2028
01:49:09,741 --> 01:49:15,202
"Don't stare at me."

2029
01:49:16,014 --> 01:49:19,541
"My skirt is colorful."

2030
01:49:19,618 --> 01:49:24,021
"My skirt is colorful."

2031
01:49:31,363 --> 01:49:34,332
"l daily pray for your wellbeing."

2032
01:49:34,399 --> 01:49:36,697
"l don't pray for anything else."

2033
01:49:36,768 --> 01:49:40,033
"l should die at your feet."

2034
01:49:40,105 --> 01:49:42,573
"l don't pray for anything else."

2035
01:49:53,585 --> 01:49:55,382
"l left my house all decked up."

2036
01:49:55,454 --> 01:49:57,422
"people go crazy
looking at my gait."

2037
01:50:00,526 --> 01:50:02,653
"l left my house all decked up."

2038
01:50:02,728 --> 01:50:04,593
"people go crazy
looking at my gait."

2039
01:50:04,663 --> 01:50:06,654
"They go crazy over my hair."

2040
01:50:06,732 --> 01:50:08,393
"They go crazy
about the way I move."

2041
01:50:08,467 --> 01:50:10,492
"They go crazy over my hair."

2042
01:50:10,569 --> 01:50:12,503
"They go crazy
about the way I move."

2043
01:50:12,571 --> 01:50:17,304
"Don't stare at me."

2044
01:50:18,510 --> 01:50:22,139
"My skirt is colorful."

2045
01:50:22,214 --> 01:50:26,446
"My skirt is colorful."

2046
01:50:31,290 --> 01:50:33,155
Back off, fatso.

2047
01:50:34,293 --> 01:50:35,385
Babloo.

2048
01:50:35,460 --> 01:50:37,428
Drink a little.
- Babloo.

2049
01:50:38,030 --> 01:50:39,657
Babloo.
- Babloo.

2050
01:50:39,731 --> 01:50:40,959
Babloo.
- Babloo.

2051
01:50:41,333 --> 01:50:43,392
Babloo. - No.

2052
01:50:43,635 --> 01:50:45,296
Babloo. Babloo.

2053
01:50:45,337 --> 01:50:47,305
Sir. Sir. please, sir.

2054
01:50:47,372 --> 01:50:49,033
What are you doing, sir? No, sir.

2055
01:50:49,107 --> 01:50:50,972
No.

2056
01:50:51,043 --> 01:50:52,567
Enough.

2057
01:50:58,517 --> 01:50:59,541
They are scoundrels.

2058
01:51:00,385 --> 01:51:01,374
Let's go. - Let's go.

2059
01:51:02,321 --> 01:51:04,346
Thank you, Benny. Thank you.

2060
01:51:04,423 --> 01:51:05,481
Welcome. Welcome. - Thank you.
- Welcome. Welcome.

2061
01:51:05,557 --> 01:51:06,615
Welcome. - Thank you.

2062
01:51:06,692 --> 01:51:08,125
We were dancing and they..
- Don't worry. Don't worry.

2063
01:51:08,193 --> 01:51:09,251
What's going on?

2064
01:51:09,328 --> 01:51:11,262
Having a party in Lonavala?
- No, sir. - No.

2065
01:51:11,330 --> 01:51:13,992
Rascals, Lonavala is getting a
bad name because of you guys.

2066
01:51:14,066 --> 01:51:17,001
No. No, sir. - No. - No, sir.
- They are inside.

2067
01:51:17,069 --> 01:51:18,661
They are inside, sir.
We are innocent, sir.

2068
01:51:18,737 --> 01:51:21,069
They are inside? - Yes, they are
inside, sir. - Yes, they are..

2069
01:51:22,207 --> 01:51:24,198
Let's go. Let's go. - Let's go.
Let's go. - Yes, let's go.

2070
01:51:25,243 --> 01:51:26,301
Get back.

2071
01:51:26,378 --> 01:51:28,073
Don't move from here
till sir doesn't return.

2072
01:51:28,146 --> 01:51:30,080
Come on. - Come on. Come on.
- Where are you taking me?

2073
01:51:30,148 --> 01:51:32,082
Let go of me, sir. I
haven't done anything.

2074
01:51:33,619 --> 01:51:36,952
Solanki. - Sir? You, here?

2075
01:51:40,025 --> 01:51:41,014
I am on duty.

2076
01:51:43,495 --> 01:51:44,553
He's with me.

2077
01:51:45,030 --> 01:51:46,964
Sir, what are you saying?
- Get in. Come on.

2078
01:51:47,032 --> 01:51:48,624
Sir. Sir.. - Get in. Come on.

2079
01:51:49,301 --> 01:51:50,359
Sir..

2080
01:51:50,435 --> 01:51:52,960
Your Honor, on 8th June,
Saturday night..

2081
01:51:53,038 --> 01:51:54,972
..at that farmhouse in Lonavala..

2082
01:51:55,040 --> 01:51:58,203
..Benny Kutty and
Babloo Charan Lathi..

2083
01:51:58,276 --> 01:52:01,245
..supplied these six
girls from the ladies bar.

2084
01:52:01,313 --> 01:52:02,302
We are innocent, sir.

2085
01:52:06,652 --> 01:52:07,914
They made them dance.

2086
01:52:08,220 --> 01:52:10,984
And under the pretext
of a private party..

2087
01:52:11,056 --> 01:52:12,045
..they made them do a public show.

2088
01:52:12,991 --> 01:52:17,985
Your Honor, Goyal Sinha,
Ashwin Kelkar..

2089
01:52:18,063 --> 01:52:22,193
..Mahesh Sarang and
Maheshwari lyer were present there.

2090
01:52:22,267 --> 01:52:24,497
No. No. No. Your Honor,
where is that officer?

2091
01:52:24,569 --> 01:52:25,558
These people are not the same.

2092
01:52:26,238 --> 01:52:29,002
Babloo Charan Lathi,
you are refusing..

2093
01:52:29,074 --> 01:52:32,066
..to recognize your
clients to hide your crime?

2094
01:52:32,144 --> 01:52:33,202
Your Honor, I am telling the truth..

2095
01:52:33,278 --> 01:52:37,009
Okay. I would like to call
the police inspector Solanki..

2096
01:52:37,082 --> 01:52:39,312
..who was present
there at the scene.

2097
01:52:39,618 --> 01:52:43,019
Your Honor, that night,
along with the two of them..

2098
01:52:43,088 --> 01:52:44,419
..I arrested these four men.

2099
01:52:45,223 --> 01:52:48,954
Your Honor, now tell us, will
you trust Maharashtra's police..

2100
01:52:49,027 --> 01:52:50,961
..or Babloo Charan Lathi who works..

2101
01:52:51,029 --> 01:52:54,192
..at a cheap, disgusting
ladies bar named Ghungroo?

2102
01:52:54,499 --> 01:52:56,262
A place that is not
less than a brothel.

2103
01:53:01,573 --> 01:53:03,006
What are you saying, sir?

2104
01:53:03,308 --> 01:53:06,072
Why do you relate all
ladies bar with a brothel?

2105
01:53:06,411 --> 01:53:08,072
Sir, I have worked there.

2106
01:53:08,146 --> 01:53:11,980
Girls work there to
run their households.

2107
01:53:12,050 --> 01:53:14,450
That place is infamous,
but it is not a brothel.

2108
01:53:14,519 --> 01:53:15,577
And nor are these girls prostitutes.

2109
01:53:20,058 --> 01:53:23,994
Your Honor, he is talking
as if he is not working..

2110
01:53:24,062 --> 01:53:26,155
..in a ladies bar,
but a five star hotel.

2111
01:53:27,299 --> 01:53:32,066
Your Honor, Mr. Benny Kutty
works in a five star hotel.

2112
01:53:33,004 --> 01:53:36,064
But he didn't even spare his friend.

2113
01:53:36,675 --> 01:53:39,075
He got him involved in
his business as well.

2114
01:53:39,144 --> 01:53:41,669
And made him a pimp like himself.

2115
01:53:42,013 --> 01:53:43,105
Who are you calling a pimp?

2116
01:53:43,682 --> 01:53:45,616
He is my friend. He is not a pimp.

2117
01:53:45,684 --> 01:53:47,242
If you want to see a pimp,
then go to that five star hotel.

2118
01:53:47,953 --> 01:53:49,477
Look, Benny.. - No..
- What are you saying? - No, Babloo.

2119
01:53:49,554 --> 01:53:51,317
I had hidden
everything from you till today.

2120
01:53:51,389 --> 01:53:52,583
There's a turmoil
taking place inside me.

2121
01:53:52,657 --> 01:53:53,954
Sir, the party he is talking about..

2122
01:53:54,025 --> 01:53:56,289
..was organized by my hotel.

2123
01:53:57,696 --> 01:53:59,163
Mirage, the five star hotel.

2124
01:53:59,231 --> 01:54:01,893
I don't know how they got
a five-star certificate.

2125
01:54:03,268 --> 01:54:09,503
Government gave it a five-star
certificate to run a posh brothel.

2126
01:54:10,442 --> 01:54:13,138
All illicit things
take place here, sir.

2127
01:54:13,211 --> 01:54:15,975
Someone's husband with
someone else's wife..

2128
01:54:16,047 --> 01:54:18,072
Someone's wife with
someone else's husband..

2129
01:54:18,150 --> 01:54:19,208
I feel embarrassed to talk about it.

2130
01:54:19,284 --> 01:54:20,273
But such things
take place there, sir.

2131
01:54:21,520 --> 01:54:22,509
Two weeks..

2132
01:54:22,988 --> 01:54:27,049
In two weeks, I came to know
that people aren't respected here.

2133
01:54:28,593 --> 01:54:32,051
One should at least
respect the dead, sir.

2134
01:54:32,130 --> 01:54:35,930
Someone died in the hotel
room after having a burger, sir.

2135
01:54:36,301 --> 01:54:38,326
They kept him alive for the public.

2136
01:54:38,670 --> 01:54:40,535
Then they took him
to the nursing home..

2137
01:54:40,605 --> 01:54:42,402
..and they declared
that he died there.

2138
01:54:43,608 --> 01:54:45,007
Why did they say that, sir?

2139
01:54:45,443 --> 01:54:49,004
Sir, the hotel's reputation will
get hampered as he died in the hotel.

2140
01:54:50,048 --> 01:54:51,606
Hotels have great value here, sir.

2141
01:54:52,484 --> 01:54:53,883
people don't have any value.

2142
01:54:54,252 --> 01:54:56,277
What is over there? Yes, a disco.

2143
01:54:56,955 --> 01:55:00,391
It is not a disco,
sir. Drugs are sold there.

2144
01:55:01,426 --> 01:55:04,623
prostitution takes
place in the disco, sir.

2145
01:55:05,096 --> 01:55:06,427
And he is calling us pimp.

2146
01:55:11,036 --> 01:55:12,025
What is your problem?

2147
01:55:13,705 --> 01:55:17,106
Don't call us pimp. Mind it.

2148
01:55:17,175 --> 01:55:19,507
I am Benny.. the.. Benny.

2149
01:55:21,046 --> 01:55:23,446
I want to apologize to you. I.. I..

2150
01:55:23,982 --> 01:55:27,042
I used to pull your leg
because you worked in a ladies bar.

2151
01:55:27,118 --> 01:55:28,449
That also increased your height.

2152
01:55:28,520 --> 01:55:30,078
You now reach till here. I am sorry.

2153
01:55:31,656 --> 01:55:32,645
Benny.

2154
01:55:35,293 --> 01:55:36,555
So this is what
happens in five-stars.

2155
01:55:37,596 --> 01:55:39,928
Don't worry. The
culprits will be punished.

2156
01:55:40,332 --> 01:55:41,663
The court is adjourned for today.

2157
01:55:42,300 --> 01:55:44,666
Next hearing will be
on the 21st of July.

2158
01:55:44,736 --> 01:55:45,930
We will.. - Mr. Negi.

2159
01:55:46,338 --> 01:55:47,362
What is happening?

2160
01:55:48,006 --> 01:55:49,564
How did Benny and Babloo
get involved in this case?

2161
01:55:50,175 --> 01:55:52,006
You very well know
that they are innocent.

2162
01:55:52,077 --> 01:55:53,544
Sheena, calm down. Calm down.

2163
01:55:54,012 --> 01:55:55,570
I know Benny is innocent.

2164
01:55:56,014 --> 01:55:57,345
That's why I have called Mr. Shinde.

2165
01:55:57,616 --> 01:55:59,550
He is one of the top
most lawyers of lndia.

2166
01:56:00,018 --> 01:56:01,178
And Benny is our staff member.

2167
01:56:01,253 --> 01:56:02,311
He is one of us.

2168
01:56:02,387 --> 01:56:03,945
We will see to it that
he is out of trouble.

2169
01:56:04,422 --> 01:56:07,084
But along with Benny, we have to
save our hotel's reputation as well.

2170
01:56:07,626 --> 01:56:09,150
I hope you understand.

2171
01:56:09,227 --> 01:56:12,128
But if.. - Now this
case is mine, Mr. Negi.

2172
01:56:12,197 --> 01:56:14,358
I will handle everything.

2173
01:56:14,432 --> 01:56:17,094
You don't need to worry at all.

2174
01:56:17,636 --> 01:56:19,035
At the next hearing
on the 21st of July..

2175
01:56:19,104 --> 01:56:23,040
..if I don't get
this case dismissed..

2176
01:56:23,108 --> 01:56:24,973
..then I will leave my practice.

2177
01:56:25,577 --> 01:56:30,037
Because section
128 and 178 are for..

2178
01:56:30,115 --> 01:56:33,084
..those who send girls
there in front of the witness.

2179
01:56:33,485 --> 01:56:35,385
And there is no
witness in this case.

2180
01:56:35,453 --> 01:56:37,978
Therefore this
case is null and void.

2181
01:56:38,290 --> 01:56:40,986
Just do as I say.

2182
01:56:41,326 --> 01:56:42,315
Okay, sir.

2183
01:56:43,395 --> 01:56:46,193
Don't worry. You will
be free on 21st July.

2184
01:57:08,153 --> 01:57:11,418
'Under section 127
and section 111..'

2185
01:57:11,489 --> 01:57:15,050
'..all the girls of the bar are
sentenced to 6 months' imprisonment.'

2186
01:57:15,360 --> 01:57:17,294
'6 months' rigorous imprisonment.'

2187
01:57:19,331 --> 01:57:23,028
'Benny Kutty and
Babloo Charan Lathi..'

2188
01:57:23,101 --> 01:57:26,628
'..forced the bar girls
to take up prostitution.'

2189
01:57:27,038 --> 01:57:32,032
'Hence under section
128 and section 278..'

2190
01:57:32,110 --> 01:57:35,273
'..are sentenced to
one year's imprisonment.'

2191
01:57:35,714 --> 01:57:37,978
'One year rigorous imprisonment.'

2192
01:57:39,184 --> 01:57:44,281
"Beloved."

2193
01:57:51,329 --> 01:57:57,097
"Don't.."

2194
01:57:59,004 --> 01:58:00,301
That way, sir. - Thank you. - Yes.

2195
01:58:02,007 --> 01:58:03,406
Welcome.
- Good evening, sir.

2196
01:58:03,475 --> 01:58:04,533
Thank you. - That way, ma'am.

2197
01:58:05,210 --> 01:58:06,199
Welcome, madam.

2198
01:58:07,312 --> 01:58:09,337
Good evening, sir. That way, sir.
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2199
01:58:10,615 --> 01:58:12,105
Hello, sir. - How are you, Mr. Negi?

2200
01:58:12,183 --> 01:58:14,014
Welcome to Mirage. - Hello.
- Hello, Sister-in-law.

2201
01:58:14,085 --> 01:58:15,950
Hello. - Hello.
- Mr. Negi. - Hello, sir.

2202
01:58:16,621 --> 01:58:19,021
You have one week's
complimentary stay in this hotel..

2203
01:58:19,090 --> 01:58:20,352
..so enjoy yourselves.

2204
01:58:20,692 --> 01:58:22,216
Sister-in-law, you must try our spa.

2205
01:58:22,293 --> 01:58:23,555
We have some great massages.
- Yes?

2206
01:58:23,628 --> 01:58:25,493
Beauty parlour and lots of stuff,
you know. - Oh, sure.

2207
01:58:25,563 --> 01:58:27,360
And we have loads of fun
with the children, you know?

2208
01:58:27,432 --> 01:58:29,024
He's such a cute kid.
What is your name, Son?

2209
01:58:29,100 --> 01:58:30,089
Never mind. Take them.

2210
01:58:30,368 --> 01:58:32,359
please come. - Come, this way.
- Hurry up, come on.

2211
01:58:32,771 --> 01:58:34,705
Sir, if you need anything,
anything at all..

2212
01:58:34,773 --> 01:58:36,570
..I am available 24/7.

2213
01:58:41,312 --> 01:58:42,370
Look, Ram.. - Yes, sir?

2214
01:58:42,447 --> 01:58:44,711
Mrs. Saigal has badly
thrashed Mr. Saigal.

2215
01:58:44,783 --> 01:58:46,648
I want you to prepare the
bail documents right away.

2216
01:58:46,718 --> 01:58:49,346
And you? Mahesh, go
to Cooper Hospital.

2217
01:58:49,421 --> 01:58:51,218
Mr. Saigal has gone to Cooper
Hospital for a medical check-up.

2218
01:58:51,289 --> 01:58:52,984
Make sure that the
medical reports are light..

2219
01:58:53,058 --> 01:58:54,582
..so that we can win this case.

2220
01:58:54,659 --> 01:58:55,648
Hey, geek.

2221
01:58:57,729 --> 01:58:59,663
Geek? - Yes, you.

2222
01:59:00,298 --> 01:59:02,061
Hey, who are you talking to?

2223
01:59:02,133 --> 01:59:03,122
Cool.

2224
01:59:06,538 --> 01:59:08,062
I think he knows her.
- Yes, who is she?

2225
01:59:08,139 --> 01:59:09,231
Saw the way she was talking to sir?

2226
01:59:10,075 --> 01:59:11,542
You forgot me, squirt?

2227
01:59:12,143 --> 01:59:15,476
How can I forget you, Hema?

2228
01:59:16,147 --> 01:59:19,014
Remember, you used to
sit with one beer bottle..

2229
01:59:19,084 --> 01:59:21,382
..and stare at me for 3
hours in the dance bar?

2230
01:59:21,453 --> 01:59:25,287
Hema, I also used to give
10 bills of Rs. 10 as well.

2231
01:59:25,356 --> 01:59:28,052
Yes. How can I forget that?

2232
01:59:28,693 --> 01:59:30,991
But, friend, you
haven't changed at all.

2233
01:59:31,696 --> 01:59:33,391
You have just put on some weight.
- No, I haven't.

2234
01:59:33,465 --> 01:59:35,057
You feel so because l
am wearing a coat, Hema.

2235
01:59:35,133 --> 01:59:36,623
And you are losing hair as well.

2236
01:59:36,701 --> 01:59:38,100
I got a haircut
just yesterday, Hema.

2237
01:59:39,704 --> 01:59:42,400
Your geek has become
a very big lawyer.

2238
01:59:42,707 --> 01:59:44,231
Amit Bhalla, advocate.

2239
01:59:45,043 --> 01:59:46,203
But what are you doing here?

2240
01:59:48,246 --> 01:59:49,645
The same old story, my friend.

2241
01:59:50,448 --> 01:59:51,437
A raid took place.

2242
01:59:51,983 --> 01:59:53,974
Others got released, but bar girls..

2243
01:59:54,052 --> 01:59:57,351
..don't get a fair
hearing or justice.

2244
01:59:58,223 --> 01:59:59,383
We got sentenced for 6 months.

2245
01:59:59,457 --> 02:00:00,981
God didn't give me a
chance to do anything..

2246
02:00:01,059 --> 02:00:02,390
..for you in the
last 15 years, Hema.

2247
02:00:02,460 --> 02:00:05,224
But now this Bhalla will not
let go of this opportunity.

2248
02:00:06,364 --> 02:00:10,528
15 days. You all
will be out in 15 days.

2249
02:00:12,070 --> 02:00:13,560
Seriously.
- Really? - Yes.

2250
02:00:14,372 --> 02:00:15,600
And listen. - Yes?

2251
02:00:15,673 --> 02:00:19,109
Call me "geek" once again. - Geek.

2252
02:00:19,177 --> 02:00:20,940
Great.

2253
02:00:29,287 --> 02:00:33,018
"I'll signal through my eyes."

2254
02:00:33,091 --> 02:00:36,060
"And steal your heart."

2255
02:00:36,494 --> 02:00:40,191
"I'll signal through my eyes."

2256
02:00:40,265 --> 02:00:41,493
"And steal your heart."

2257
02:00:41,566 --> 02:00:42,965
Newbie, listen.

2258
02:00:44,435 --> 02:00:45,493
Come here.

2259
02:00:45,570 --> 02:00:46,969
"Why don't you understand me?"

2260
02:00:47,038 --> 02:00:48,562
Sir. - What is that girl's name?

2261
02:00:49,507 --> 02:00:50,565
Sir..

2262
02:00:50,642 --> 02:00:52,109
"Why do you turn your
face away and abuse me?"

2263
02:00:52,177 --> 02:00:53,235
The one on the left or
the one on the right?

2264
02:00:53,511 --> 02:00:55,638
The one on the left. - The
one on the left is Fedora, sir.

2265
02:00:55,713 --> 02:00:57,908
What is her number? Here Rs. 500.

2266
02:00:58,283 --> 02:01:02,049
Sir, 98335.. - After that?

2267
02:01:02,120 --> 02:01:03,587
5 numbers for Rs. 500, sir.

2268
02:01:03,655 --> 02:01:05,145
I don't know the rest.
I forgot, sir.

2269
02:01:05,223 --> 02:01:06,986
You are clever, rascal.

2270
02:01:07,058 --> 02:01:09,049
That I became, sir. Long story, sir.

2271
02:01:09,127 --> 02:01:10,594
Then who will tell me
the rest of the number?

2272
02:01:10,662 --> 02:01:12,391
I will tell you, sir.

2273
02:01:12,463 --> 02:01:15,455
Speak up. - Give me the money.

2274
02:01:15,533 --> 02:01:16,522
Here.

2275
02:01:17,268 --> 02:01:18,667
58551.

2276
02:01:20,004 --> 02:01:21,562
Sir, this is complimentary.

2277
02:01:22,006 --> 02:01:23,132
Carrot. Good for eyes, sir.

2278
02:01:27,345 --> 02:01:28,539
'Don't get shocked.'

2279
02:01:28,613 --> 02:01:31,548
'l left Mirage and joined Babloo.'

2280
02:01:32,350 --> 02:01:35,012
'ln the end, I am very happy.'

2281
02:01:36,254 --> 02:01:39,155
'l will give you some information
about the Mirage people.'

2282
02:01:39,224 --> 02:01:42,091
'Sheena madam left Mirage
and her husband as well.'

2283
02:01:43,027 --> 02:01:44,551
'Her husband is
still paying the EMl.'

2284
02:01:44,629 --> 02:01:47,598
'Not for himself, but for
the divorce settlement.'

2285
02:01:47,665 --> 02:01:50,498
'His house, car, and farmhouse
are now with Sheena madam.'

2286
02:01:51,069 --> 02:01:53,560
'Look, that's why she looks so
happy talking on the phone.'

2287
02:01:54,572 --> 02:01:56,130
'What? Not with me.'

2288
02:01:56,207 --> 02:01:58,072
'Don't misunderstand.'
'She is not talking to me.'

2289
02:01:58,576 --> 02:02:01,909
'Actually, I don't know
who she is talking with.'

2290
02:02:02,313 --> 02:02:06,044
'Ria madam is trying
to find some happiness.'

2291
02:02:06,117 --> 02:02:07,345
'She has joined the art of living..'

2292
02:02:07,418 --> 02:02:09,909
'..and is doing breathing
exercises and trying from her end.'

2293
02:02:10,288 --> 02:02:12,984
'She donated all
her cars and stuff.'

2294
02:02:13,057 --> 02:02:15,082
'Nowadays she does social work.'

2295
02:02:15,994 --> 02:02:18,519
'Ronnie. He looks
very happy doesn't he?'

2296
02:02:18,596 --> 02:02:19,654
'He got promoted.'

2297
02:02:19,731 --> 02:02:21,198
'From a bellboy,
he became a waiter.'

2298
02:02:21,599 --> 02:02:23,533
'Not in a hotel, on a cruise.'

2299
02:02:23,601 --> 02:02:25,364
'A cruise means a ship.'

2300
02:02:26,004 --> 02:02:29,462
'Sometimes when he calls, I say,
"What's up, Tom Cruise?"

2301
02:02:30,174 --> 02:02:31,937
'But he is happy now. Very happy.'

2302
02:02:33,144 --> 02:02:34,941
'Now.. Negi.'

2303
02:02:35,680 --> 02:02:38,308
'He is at the same post
and still on the phone.'

2304
02:02:38,750 --> 02:02:40,684
'Nothing changed
except for the hotel.'

2305
02:02:41,119 --> 02:02:44,247
'There is a less
famous hotel in Malad.'

2306
02:02:44,322 --> 02:02:46,222
'It's called Dil Khush
Lodging and Boarding.'

2307
02:02:46,557 --> 02:02:48,957
'As far as the five stars and
the ladies bars are concerned..'

2308
02:02:49,027 --> 02:02:52,224
'..they are doing their
business as usual in our city.'

2309
02:02:53,965 --> 02:02:57,423
'As they say in our city, no matter
what the situation, life goes on.'

2310
02:02:58,970 --> 02:03:01,370
'Well, everything else is happy.'

2311
02:03:01,439 --> 02:03:03,270
'Nice. I hope you are also happy.'

2312
02:03:03,341 --> 02:03:04,569
'Thanking you, yours sincerely.'

2313
02:03:05,143 --> 02:03:07,907
'This is Benny who was
once upon a time a bellboy.'

2314
02:03:08,046 --> 02:03:12,039
'Thank you.'
