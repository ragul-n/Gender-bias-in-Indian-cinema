It's the wedding season
in India,

6
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,240
thousands of young people
are getting married.

7
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,720
This lavish marriage
in a five-star hotel

8
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,520
has cost thousands of pounds.

9
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,880
Weddings in today's India

10
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,920
are increasingly
about conspicuous consumption,

11
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,960
spend it, flaunt it.

12
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:51,360
Across town, a Muslim ceremony
with the dowry out on show.

13
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,120
Gifts and cash

14
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,960
Muslims never used to give
dowries.

We have organized a motorbike,

it's a latest brand
of the LML Freedom that is.

17
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,400
We bought a cupboard

18
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:07,000

21-inch a flat-front TV

The moment his daughter
was born,

26
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,240
the bride's father
started saving for this day.

27
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:35,480
No expense has been spared,
no detail overlooked.

28
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,200
The dowry will have
set his family back

29
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,240
a small fortune.

30
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,200
And for the groom's family,
it's bonanza time,

31
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,360
gifts all around.

32
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,240
The market's just driving dowry,
it's--

33
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,320
You know, it's like a new engine
to this whole thing of dowry.

34
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,600
And it's being driven
by the market,

35
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,720
it's being driven
by consumerism,

36
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,480
it's being driven by the feeling
that, "Okay, we want this

37
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,360
and this is an easy way
to get it."

Dowry demands for money,
ultimatums and threats

40
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,280
can keep going
long after the wedding is over,

41
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,360
with constant pressure
on young brides

42
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,720

Day after day,

51
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,280
brides come with their parents
complaining about demands,

52
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,800
about beatings
and mental torture.

53
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,120
In male-dominated
Indian society,

54
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,480
women here
seem to be fighting back.

55
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,000
Sir, go to hell!

56
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,120
Get out of here!
Behave yourself.

57
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,720
[Adam]
But they're up
against generations

58
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,120
of discrimination.

59
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,760
[Adam]
The dowry was outlawed
40 years ago,

60
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,400
but with the booming economy
it's now back with a vengeance.

61
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:28,080
Behind almost every case
are rows about dowry.

62
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,320
The officer in charge
is superintendent Vimla Mehra.

00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,560
One of the main problems is,
of course, dowry.

65
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,160
And I don't know why it happens,

66
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:47,400
because it seems that
more and more women come to us

67
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,920
that, "My husband is asking
for a scooter or a motor vehicle

68
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,800
or some jewellery or some money

69
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,840
so that he could start
his business."

70
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,320
Perhaps, it's one of
the easiest way to get money.

A local journalist,
Smita Chaudhary,

73
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:10,000

surging back.

74
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Another case has just come in.

75
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,240
This woman from Rajasthan
has brought her family

76
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,200
to the police station.

77
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,280
She claims one of her daughters
was killed

78
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,480
by her son-in-law's family.

79
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,960
Anju was burned to death
in the kitchen.

80
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,520

the dowry back.

Three children?

82
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,600
[Smita]
Yes, she had three more sons
and the eldest of them

83
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,600
has gone mad
after that incident.

84
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,320
[Adam]
Her other daughter is married
into the same family

85
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,600
and the mother claims

86
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,480
she's now being harassed
for dowry as well.

87
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,400
[Smita]
She says I want justice
and I want all the money

88
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,560
which I've given for dowry.

89
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,800

How much money did she give?

90
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,560
[speaking in Hindi]

91
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:56,360

She gave Rs. 250,000 worth
of stuff to two sisters.

92
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:00,120
[Adam]
That's a huge sum
for this family, over £3,000.

93
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,160
It's dowry again, and again,
and again.

94
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,920
What I'm not sure about is why
she brought this case up now,

95
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,240
her daughter died two years ago.

96
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,560
Actually, she's--

97
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,040
Now she feels that
there's no hope for this girl,

98
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,080
because they're asking
for the dowry once again.

99
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,360
So there's no hope
Hmm.
to settle this child.

100
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,080
And she'd have to pay out
more money

101
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,560
if she has to send her back.

102
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,960
She's been asked for
yet more dowry

103
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,480
on top of what
she's already paid?
Yes.

104
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,720
Because they're saying
that has been consumed

105
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,200
with the first daughter's
marriage

106
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,080
and so she should pay again.

107
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,440
[Adam]
The in-laws' family
have all turned up

108
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,840

who are brothers,

109
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,000

into the argument.

[Adam]
One says they were never
legally married,

112
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,680
because the girls
were too young.

114
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,840
[Adam]
The row is all about money.

115
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,440
Everyone seems far more worried
about the cash

116
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,880
than the dead girl.

118
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,680

In the middle of the arguing
and the abuse,

00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,480

is trying to work out

120
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,160

Everyone has
a different point of view

123

and anyone within shouting range
gets an earful.

125
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,120

no relationship whatsoever

128
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,200
Where the truth lies,
I don't know yet.

[arguing in Hindi]

130
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,760
Right.
They were married as children.

131
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,240
So the marriage is not valid...
And that's a--
that's a Rajasthani custom?

132
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,720
Yeah.
Yes.

133
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,240
Alright.
But that's not--
that's not valid legally.

134
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,680
So there's one guy who saying,

135
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,560
"There is no marriage,
so what are we talking about?"

136
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,480
So you see we have a law,
and we have a caste system,

137
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,600
and we have a Panchayat,
and we have families.

and it all makes a mess.

she has burnt herself

while boiling milk.

145
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,880
Which is possible, but you know,
only the women are boiling milk

146
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,440
and then they are
burning themselves off like--

And always the young ones.

held her hands, daughter--

174
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,640
sister-in-law put fire to her

175
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,360
and the husband poured kerosene
over her.

176
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,600
But the husband is out,

177
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,600
the rest of the family
is inside the jail.

178
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,040
[Adam]
Dowry crime
was spiraling out of control.

179
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,680
And the government passed laws,

180
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,040
so that anyone
even remotely connected

181
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:58,040
to the death of a wife
can be thrown in jail.

182
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,240
If a bride dies

183
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,040
in the first seven years
of marriage,

184
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,760
her family can file a charge
alleging dowry crime.

185
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,800
All the in-laws
can be imprisoned.

186
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:15,320
[♪♪♪]

187
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,920
[Adam]
I came across mothers, sisters,
sons, daughters, aunts,

188
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,600
even nieces and nephews,
all behind bars in Tihar.

189
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,760
This is--

190
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,880
[speaking in Hindi]

191
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,600
[Adam]
Some are growing up in jail

192
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,600
simply because
their families are here.

193
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,640
Who's this?

194
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,000
This is the son
of one of the women

195
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,840
who's in the-- who's in the--
this cell?

196
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,000
Yeah.

197
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,200
Her sister-in-law died,

198
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,440
so this is one
of the sisters-in-law, her son.

199
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,920
[Adam]
Yeah.

200
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,760
Raja, Raja, Raja.

201
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,760
[woman speaking in Hindi]

202
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,680
[Adam]
This old woman and her daughter
have done two years

203
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,560
of a 20-year sentence
for murder.

204
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,680
The son wasn't charged.

205
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,960
The women claim
they weren't there

206
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,360
when the daughter-in-law died.

207
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,320
[Anjel]
The daughter-in-law
bolted the door from inside

208
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,480
and put herself on fire.

209
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,920
How is she responsible
for her daughter-in-law's death?

210
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,320
[Smita]
Basically,
the boy was very jealous

211
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,720
and they were fighting
very badly.

212
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,400
And the sister-in-law feels that
this was a tension

213
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,800
between husband and wife
and they got involved in it.

214
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,640
She feels very lonely
and abandoned also,

215
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,760
because the son
doesn't come to meet her either.

216
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,760
He has gotten married again,
he has family.

217
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,920
[Adam]
And then he doesn't come here
any longer?

218
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,920
[speaking in Hindi]

219
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,120
She says that,
if I had done something

220
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,720
I would've felt satisfied,

221
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,360
"Okay, I did it
that's why I'm here."

222
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,480
[Adam]
But-- yeah.

223
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,160
But she feels
she didn't do anything.

224
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,320
And now
she's been abandoned here.

225
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,000
The so-called accident
is always the same.

226
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,920
It's always in the kitchen
and nobody's ever at home.

227
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,240
She says that, yes,
I've been committed unfairly

228
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,480
that my daughter-in-law herself
said that while she was cooking,

229
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,280
her nightgown caught fire.

230
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,440
She gave that
a dying declaration.

231
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,640
Everybody here says,

232
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,560
"It wasn't me,
I'm not-- I'm not guilty."

233
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,160
And I-- I'm-- I'm puzzled
by what they're doing here then.

234
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,280
The conviction is if the dowry--

235
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,880
if the suicide or the death
has been abetted--

236
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,320
[Adam]
Right, that's enough.

237
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,680
That is also a reason
for conviction.

238
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,840
[Adam]
Yeah, right, right.
And that reason

239
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,160
can be either present
very obviously

240
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,280
like in the actual burning
or a mental state of mind

241
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,400
or the pressures that are there
on the daughter-in-law.

242
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,160
[Adam]
So if you're involved
in the harassment,

243
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,680
in the view of the court,
you're part of the crime.
Yes.

244
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,880
What they say is that,

245
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,800
"Look, our mother-in-laws
used to taunt us,

246
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,240
so we were made to work
very hard or whatever.

247
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,360
Or we did not have any freedom
of doing anything on our own.

248
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,080
We were like kind of answerable
to everybody in the family."

249
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,280
[Adam]
It's no surprise that few say
they're guilty.

250
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,720
But some are behind bars
carrying the can

251
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,120
for the dowry crime
committed by their sons.

252
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,320
Because in Indian society,
men are simply more important.

253
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,800
They can remarry,
find a new wife,

254
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,160
and get the new dowry
that goes with her.

255
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,680
To parents' minds,

256
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:31,840
it's ingrained in our system
that boys mean that-- it'll--

257
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,200
[Adam]
Boys mean cash, basically.

258
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,600
Uhuh, yeah.

259
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,760
[Adam]
I mean they do--
they do at marriage time,

260
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,800
certainly.
Yes.

261
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,040
[Adam]
Boys mean cash.
Yeah.

Kajal and Anand,
the perfect union.

264
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,200
Two young doctors
from good families,

265
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,120
an arranged marriage
and a financial deal.

266
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,440
It looked like
a match made in heaven.

267
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,440
Beautiful, upwardly mobile,
Kajal Sharma

268
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,200

from a higher caste family

269
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,560
in need of cash.

270
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,920
So this is um-

271
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,160
[Smita]
This is Kajal's room.

272
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,200
Hmm.

273
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,720
[Smita]
There are gifts to be given

274
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,440
throughout the year
at every festival

275
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,480
and then when the girl
has a child and-

276
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,080
[Adam]
Yeah.

277
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,840
[Smita]
Uh, so you know, your parents
prepare in advance

278
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,240
for all these things.

279
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,880
[Adam]
So this-
she's already bought all this?

280
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,560
[Smita]
This was for the future, yes,
for the entire year.

281
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,560
[speaking in Hindi]

282
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,200
[Adam]
Kajal Sharma's parents had spent
a fortune on her education.

283
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,560
Pretty and clever,

284
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,520
they now wanted
an upper-class husband for her.

285
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,080
And they knew
the right young man

286
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:01,080
would cost them
thousands of pounds.

287
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,720
[woman speaking in Hindi]

288
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,960
[Smita]
They're her books

289
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,560
and that's a teddy
she gifted to her mother.

290
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,640
[Adam]
That-- that-- that teddy bear?

291
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,600
[Smita]
[Adam]
Yeah.
Yeah.

293
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,760
[Smita]
She used called her
mother "teddy bear" only.

294
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,360
[Adam]
Did she?
Yeah, yeah.

295
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,360
[speaks in Hindi]

296
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,400
[Adam]
Yeah.

297
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,000
The wedding costs and the dowry
were mounting by the day.

298
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,320
And Kajal's father
even had to turn to her brothers

299
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,680
for money.

300
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,760
So this was a grand wedding?

301
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,160
It was a grand wedding.

302
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,320
What are these, I mean--

303
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:49,200
These are
gold and diamond ornaments.

304
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,040
And these were what,
presents from your family?

305
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:56,280
Yes, they were presents
from my family and the relatives

306
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,280
to the girl for her marriage.

307
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,640
[Adam]
In the marriage video,
Kajal is on show,

308
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,760
packaged up
in her wedding finery.

309
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,480
This wasn't a love marriage?

310
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,640
No, no.

311
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,320
But why, in that case?

312
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,040
Why-- why push your daughter
into a marriage

313
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,320
that wasn't a love marriage?

314
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,960
[speaks in Hindi]

315
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,040
[Smita]
They were after us
for the marriage

316
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,240
and they were so persuasive
that it seemed like

317
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,440
they really wanted my daughter
and that was good enough reason

318
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,800
to have her married
in that house.

319
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,760
And when somebody's asking
for a girl,

320
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,680
then you presume that
they would also treat her well.

321
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,760
[Adam]
The money thing was
really important to them,

322
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,640
It was very--
was it?
it everything.

323
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:39,440
Like the father, Mr BB--
Dr BB Singh,

324
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,160
he had called my father once
before the marriage

325
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,440
to his house in the morning
to discuss that,

326
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,600
"What is your budget?"

327
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,200
That was the word he had used,
"budget".

328
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,960
Budget is a financial word.

329
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,560
Then at that time
my father gave him

330
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,120
a good scolding that,

331
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,160
"If you want money from us,
we will not marry our daughter."

332
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,240
Then he-- at that time he said,
"Oh, don't be angry.

333
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,720
We will not talk like this."

334
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:03,440
[Adam]
The Sharmas drew the line
at buying a £7,000 Toyota car

335
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,920
for the Singhs.

336
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:08,160
But they did eventually settle
on a final dowry figure.

337
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,520
I'm not very experienced
on what goes on,

338
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,920
but this was obviously a wedding
where lot of effort,

339
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,520
a lot of expense was put in.

340
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:22,120
I mean some of these clothes
are incredibly ornate.

341
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,520
And all these decorations
and the jewellery

342
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,080
that the bride's wearing.

343
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,520
There's a picture somewhere.

344
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,960
There we are.

345
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,640
With her mother.

346
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,560
Mr Sharma is an engineer.

347
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,440
Not badly paid,
certainly not rich.

348
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,120
He'd been saving
for Kajal's wedding

349
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,600
since her birth,

350
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,680
even so he said that
the dowry was destroying him.

351
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,200
And days before the marriage,
new demands for cash.

352
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,000
Yeah.
55,000.

353
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,720
This I got in cash from bank.

354
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,120
Out of this 55,000,
50,000 I gave to him in cash.

355
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:02,000
Then this money, 75,000,
this I paid him in cheque.

356
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,120
Right.

357
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,520
I mean, you--
you were breaking the law

358
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,480
doing that, weren't you?

359
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,520
Because the law in this country

360
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:12,119
is that you should not give
more than Rs. 5,000 of gifts.

361
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:15,000
Nobody follows that law.

362
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,599
Otherwise-
So that-- that law is ignored?

363
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:19,920
Otherwise, nobody will be able
to marry his daughter.

364
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,440
Because the rules of the society
are different

365
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:25,319
and the rules on paper,
they are different.

366
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,880
[Adam]
You've had to borrow to do this,

367
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,560
how many years will it take you
to uh, to pay off your debts?

368
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,120
This will go
all through my life.

369
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,840
[Adam]
Rest of your life?
Yeah.

370
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,760
[Adam]
The wedding, the dowry,
the gifts,

371
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,760
it added up, the Sharmas say,
about £15,000.

372
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,120
And the Singhs
were still going on

373
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:49,320
about the car,
the Toyota Qualis.

374
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,960
But this car that was what,
part of the dowry?

375
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,560
[man 2]
Toyota Qualis.

376
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,200
They had asked it
before the marriage,

377
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,800
but there we had refused.

378
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,560
But after, right the marriage,

379
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,880
they started behaving
in just the opposite way.

380
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,840
They started saying,
"No, you have to give car.

381
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,960
How will my son travel
without a car?"

382
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,600
[Adam]
The Sharmas say they rejected
the demand again.

383
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,880
Kajal and Anand went to Calcutta
and she completed her studies.

384
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,800
She complained that
Anand was stopping her

385
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:20,360
from revising for her exams.

386
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,760
She passed them
and they returned to Delhi

387
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,600
and moved
into the Singh family home.

388
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,560
Kajal was still being pressed
for more dowry.

389
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,040
[man 3]
She was crying the day
she called me up

390
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,880
and she was telling that
Anand was creating problems,

391
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,600
and he telling that
"You have to bring the car.

392
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,040
You have to pressurize
your parents."

393
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:46,080
[Adam]
A day later, the phone rang,
something was seriously wrong.

394
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,160
It was in the evening
of 9th June when her husband,

395
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,600
he called me
and told me to reach their house

396
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,640
as early as possible.

397
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,320
I asked him,
"What is the matter?"

398
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,840
Then he told me
on the telephone.

399
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,040
[Adam]
He told you on the phone?

400
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,280
And he said it
in a very casual sort of--

401
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,480
[Adam]
What did he--
What did he say?

402
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,520
He just said...
[speaks in Hindi]

403
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,120
"We had gone--
I had gone out

404
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,120
and she had not taken
her dinner, she said,

405
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,280
'I don't want to eat.'

406
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,760
So I went out
and when I came back,

407
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,840
I found her hanging."

408
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,960
He just said it
as a matter of fact.

409
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,880
[Adam]
Kajal was dead
hanged in her bedroom.

410
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,600
On the news her father-in-law
was filmed saying,

411
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,800
she'd tied a scarf
round her neck

412
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,200
and then hanged herself
from a door handle.

413
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:36,640
Kajal's brother, a doctor, said
it couldn't have been suicide.

414
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,360
You must realize that
it was my brother

415
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,080
who first reached there.

416
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,640
He reached there at about 7:00.

417
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,760
Death has taken place
around 3:00, 3:00 or something.

418
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,360
No police was--
had been called,

419
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,800
not even a medical professional
had been called.

420
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,000
Because you have to see

421
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,680
whether the person
is actually dead or not.

422
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,480
He may be in a state of coma
or something.

423
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,840
My brother only called
the police.

424
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,560
They were not willing
to call the police,

425
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:02,640
they were just wanting
to take the body and cremate it,

426
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,680
so that all the evidence
was gone.

427
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,840
They had already cut open
the ligatures

428
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,200
and removed the body.

429
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,880
Whatever they say that
she was hanging from there

430
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,360
and she was hanging from there,
that is up to them.

431
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,240
We haven't seen anything.

432
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,760
[Adam]
In spite of getting no help
from the police,

433
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,440
who they think had been bribed,

434
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:24,080
Kajal's family filed a case
alleging dowry crime.

435
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,920
Anand and his parents
were arrested at their home

436
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,200
and taken away to Tihar Jail.

437
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,840
The investigating judge
appeared to share

438
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,920
the Sharma's suspicions.

439
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,240
So-- so this,
what's it saying here?

440
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,320
Uh, this is not a case
of suicide simply cited,

441
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:47,440
but has categorical reference
to her harassment

442
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,160
on account of dowry.

443
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:52,240
So what we've got here is--
is one judge um,

444
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,960
rejecting application
from Dr. Singh

445
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,280
and uh, the rest of the family
for bail.

446
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,400
And then a few days later, uh,

447
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,480
they were released
on a technicality.

448
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,480
[speaking in Hindi]

449
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,720
[Smita interpreting]
"I want justice.

450
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,840
I've made a mistake,

451
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,440
but I'll never make
a mistake again.

452
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,400
I didn't know them,
I didn't recognize them

453
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,320
and I want justice now.

454
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,720
[Adam]
And they feared
justice was slipping away,

455
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,960
because the Singhs
were now out of prison.

456
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,960
We've been trying for days
to talk to the Singhs,

457
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,760
every attempt
to get in touch with them.

458
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,520
We've been told
it's out of the question.

459
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,320
So I've come to their house
to see if they're in.

460
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,600
The Singh family
had spent three months

461
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,760
in Tihar Jail.

462
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:45,600
Dr BB Singh, a scientist,
had been suspended from his job.

463
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,800
His son, Anand,
had trained abroad as a doctor,

464
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,400
but the qualification
was not accepted in India

465
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,120
and he'd been unable to find
any work.

466
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,320
[dogs barking]

467
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,320
[shouting in Hindi]

468
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,600
Dr. BB Singh,
I'm Adam Mynott from the BBC.

469
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,360
Please just wait.
We've come to talk to you
about...

470
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,960
...About the issue...

471
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,320
We will give you
all the answers.

472
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,760
[Adam]
Well, we-- we--What do you want?

473
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,280
we just wanted
to discuss some of the issues.

474
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,120
You can't take yourself--

475
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,240
[speaking in Hindi]
Please.

476
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,480
We just wanted to discuss
some of the issue--

477
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,640
Thank you, thank you very much.

478
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,360
The Singhs gave me
their version of events

479
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,240
very different from the Sharmas.

480
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:27,200
No torture, no harassment,
no dowry demands.

481
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,440
She put a-- a scarf,
you know the girls,

482
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,320
they wear a salwar
and this thing

483
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,560
and then put it...

484
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,720
[Adam]
Dr. Singh showed us

485
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,360
how he says
Kajal killed herself.

486
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,120
...with the neck.

487
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:42,920
She might have sat on this mura
and pushed it back.

488
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:46,920
When we discovered her body,
her body was not on the floor,

489
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,720
you know, it just
a little above the floor.

490
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:55,520
So she must have got suffocated,
you know, out of...

491
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,840
Even this was height.

492
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,480
Doctor came
with the crime branch,

493
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,640
they brought the--
all the three doctors.

494
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,280
I mean I'm not
a forensic scientist,

495
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,680
but that-- that means that
there was that--

496
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,240
Yes.
that length of--

497
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,280
I mean it seemed--

498
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,120
it just seems very,
very odd to me.

499
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,640
It seems very strange.

500
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,680
I mean why not hang yourself
if you want to commit suicide--

501
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,080
You see I don't know this.

502
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,560
Why not hang yourself
from the ceiling fan?
Yeah.

503
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,200
Or from a bracket on a wall?
Yeah.

504
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,480
Why do it in a way which--

505
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,720
No, but that I cannot answer.

506
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,800
[Anand]
So only she can answer.

507
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,520
She was the one
to choose this way,

508
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,680
only she can answer
why did she did this way.

509
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,480
I am a doctor,
she was a doctor.

510
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,520
Only she can tell.

511
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,040
How can he or how can I say

512
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,560
why the hell
did she chose this way to die?

513
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,920
I as a doctor can say, yes,
this is sufficient height

514
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,520
for a person to die.

515
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,240
This, any doctor can say.

516
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,720
This is very surprising
her brother herself

517
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,720
is a doctor and--

518
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,720
[Adam]
You-- you-- you--

519
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,840
You were her husband.

520
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,320
Yeah, I am-- I am her husband.

521
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,120
[Adam]
Did it not surprise you
that your wife could get

522
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,240
to this state without you--
without you being aware of it,

523
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,400
without you being aware
of the fact

524
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,120
that she wanted
to commit suicide?

525
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,240
Listen, this is very surprising
for everyone.

526
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,560
This is a surprise
for their family,

527
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,440
this is a surprise
for my family, for me.

528
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,920
Yeah, she used to get
some depression sometimes

529
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,000
after the exams.

530
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,360
Most of the times,

531
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,280
it was only when her brother
used to call her up.

532
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:13,320
He like, "You've got to study,
you've got to study."

533
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,520
She used to say bhaiya ,

534
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,040
like brother is saying
I'll fail.

535
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,200
I'd say, "Everything
is gonna be alright."

536
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,120
I've never prayed to God
for my exams as far as I--

537
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,160
like as much I have prayed
for her.

538
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,360
And I'm like,
I have full faith in God

539
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,160
and I was very sure
she will pass.

540
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,840
[Adam]
In your opinion
was worry about exams

541
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,960
that she had enough
for her to commit suicide?

542
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,120
Except for exam,
I don't find a single reason

543
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,120
I was the most intimate
and close person to her.

544
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:40,040
I haven't found
a single more reason that...

545
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,520
[Adam]
Her-- her--
her family claims

546
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,960
she was being tortured, harassed
by your family.

547
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,160
For what?

548
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,360
[Adam]
I don't know,
that's what they said.

549
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,760
And what about
those constant demands

550
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,040
for a brand new Qualis car?

551
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,200
As far as Qualis is concerned,

552
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,840
we can buy a Qualis
the day we want to.

553
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,200
What is the point of asking?

554
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,560
And is life of a doctor
worth just a Qualis jeep,

555
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,840
whatever it is?

556
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,920
I don't think so.

557
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,280
[Adam]
Well-- I mean they say that,

558
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,160
you know that Mr. Sharma says
he's had to borrow

559
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,920
hundreds of thousands of rupees
which he'll be paying--

560
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:08,280
He'll be paying off
for the rest of his life.

561
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,720
This is his side of story,
absolutely his side of story.

562
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,920
[Adam]
He's lying then?
When--

563
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,080
Of course, he is!

564
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,600
All this case--
the case from day one,

565
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,200
this is all based on lies.

566
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,280
She was my wife.

567
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,960
I was supposed to live my life,
she was my--

568
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,440
supposed to be my partner
for my whole-- my life.

569
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:28,040
What will I get by killing her
or if she dies?

570
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,960
Is this a bigger loss for me
or for them?

571
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,520
For whom?

572
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,160
I asked the media,
I asked these people,

573
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,360
the police, the justice,
whatever.

574
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,720
For whom this loss is?

575
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,840
What will I get by her death?

576
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:42,040
[Adam]
You're someone wrote a card
to your wife saying,

577
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,280
"I hate you
for your shrewdness."

578
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,400
Yes.

579
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,640
[Adam]
Is that-- is that the sort of-

580
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,160
[Adam]
Relations between...
And there are--

581
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:51,600
There are 20 lines
above that which are loving,

582
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,120
is it not,
if you've seen that card?

583
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,200
[Adam]
Well, there are printed ones,
yes.

584
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,680
Yeah, printed ones.

585
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,600
If I had not been having love,
why would I write that?

586
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,960
[Adam]
Well, you didn't write it,
it was written--

587
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,520
Why would I send it?
They were printed on the card.

588
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,360
I could've sent other cards.

589
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,600
[Adam]
So your-- your--
And every--

590
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,840
[Adam]
So your relations with Kajal
were--

591
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,240
In every-- every husband and--

592
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,320
[Adam]
I am, yes.
You're married?

593
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,960
Don't you have small conflicts
with your wife?

594
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,440
[Adam]
Well, I'm not answering
these questions, but then--

595
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,080
Then...
Same with me.

596
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,360
Like my wife,
we used to have small problems,

597
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,800
whatever, what is it.

598
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,240
She used to get out of head
for exams.

599
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,080
I said, "Don't worry for exams,
it's a part of life.

600
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,320
They come, they go."

601
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,000
[Adam]
So are you not at all
puzzled then

602
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,440
about why your wife--
your wife committed suicide.

603
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,720
Absolutely not.

604
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:33,480
I'm just broken,
my family's broken, that is all.

605
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,560
There's no puzzle.

606
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,880
I'm very sad that-- that yes,
at that fateful moment

607
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,160
why was I not at home?

608
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,480
Had I been maybe at home,
I would have again sit with her,

609
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,600
I would've consoled her,
the things would've been okay.

610
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,600
[Adam]
The Singhs say
Kajal had been unstable.

611
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,360
They accused her family
of neglecting her

612
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,400
and deny any dowry extortion.

613
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,120
Anand claims
he'd have done anything

614
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,400
to save her,
but this was her destiny.

615
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,400
[♪♪♪]

616
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,800
[Adam]
The Sharmas say
the suicide claims

617
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,640
are ridiculous.

618
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,120
The thing they're
particularly worried about,

619
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:19,040
one of the things
is the handwriting

620
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,680
on the suicide note.

621
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,680
It says, "I'm doing this,
because of the tension

622
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,000
of my exams.

623
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,280
I'm responsible for this,

624
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,760
no one is to be held responsible
for my death.

625
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:31,320
I've been treated very kindly
by my husband and in-laws."

626
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:34,440
Now they say there is no way
that their daughter

627
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,760
would've written that

628
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,960
and also there's no way
this is her handwriting.

629
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,040
[Adam]
The Sharmas are worried
that the police

630
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:51,000
have now either lost interest
or have been bribed

631
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,200
to drop the case.

632
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,680
They don't know their way
around the legal system.

633
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,560
[speaks in Hindi]

634
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:02,000
So they turned to Brinda Karat,

635
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,400
a leading campaigner
against dowry.

636
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,960
[Adam]
Brinda contacts the lawyers,

637
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,920
saying the case
needs a proper investigation.

638
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,240
It's a dowry death.

639
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,480
[Adam]
She's worried the authorities

640
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,520
are trying to sweep it
under the carpet.

641
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,040
Life imprisonment.

642
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,680
[Adam]
Brinda has seen it all before

643
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:04,840
and she doesn't buy
the suicide theory either.

644
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,320
It's very, very unlikely

645
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:10,200
that this girl has written
a suicide note.

646
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,000
And anyway, just looking
at the handwriting,

647
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,120
it just doesn't match.

648
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,720
Even the layperson can make out.

649
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,840
It just does not match.

650
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,800
Hmm.

651
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,200
And secondly,

652
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,760
the way that the suicide note
is framed,

653
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,960
I mean three months, two months
after the examination,

654
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,840
she's talking about tension
in the examination,

655
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,920
it definitely doesn't make
any sense.

656
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:34,400
And thirdly, from the aspect
of the demands for dowry,

657
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,000
it's extraordinary.

658
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,200
I mean we have seen
so many cases,

659
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,880
I mean we deal with
I don't know how many cases.

660
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,120
But a case
where they are giving it

661
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:47,120
in writing
before the engagement ceremony,

662
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,440
that this is what we expect you
to bring,

663
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,920
I mean it's just so blatant.

664
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:57,240
And it just shows
how the social sanction

665
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:00,840
that this practice of dowry has.

666
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,400
They thought that you know,

667
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,400
they're probably going to buy
their daughter's happiness,

668
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,960
you know.

669
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,640
Dowry really is a practice
of the educated

670
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,600
and the richer sections.

671
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,240
I mean there's just no getting--

672
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,680
It's not related to illiteracy.

673
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,240
It's not related
to being uneducated.

674
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:24,520
It's very much related
to the devaluation of women

675
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:29,680
starting from the upper layers
of society.

676
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,920

Brinda knows the police
are weighed down

677
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:35,640
by corruption and bureaucracy.

00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:40,440
First stop,
Inspector Harish Joshi's office.

679
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,440
One of the big issue
is to get the dowry back.

680
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,920
They have a half-hour meeting
which we're not allowed to film.

681
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,520
When they come out,

682
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:53,600
not much
seems to have been achieved.

683
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,360
How have you been able
to move things on today, then?

684
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,440
How?

685
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,280
Move things,
which things?

686
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:03,520
With this investigation.

687
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:08,360
Well, investigation means we--
we carry on the investigation.

688
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:12,640
What-- what have you said
to the Sharmas today?

689
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,920
Sharmas?

690
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,280
[Adam]
What--
what have you said to them?

691
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:18,440
How have you explained to them
their case is going?

692
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,960
No, I didn't talk to them,
I didn't talk to them.

693
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,240
[Adam]
But you've just had a meeting,
you had a meeting with them.

694
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,880
What did you say to them
at the meeting?

695
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,160
[Adam]
When?
Just now.

696
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,200
No, we didn't--

697
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,800
We discussed the case,
that's all.

698
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,720
[Adam]
And when--
Where is the case now?

699
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,040
Where does it stand?

700
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,160
What is the next move?

701
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,760
It's in the court,
it's in the court.

702
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:40,280
And the issue
of-- of dowry retrieval?

703
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,280
That is being examined.

704
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,880
[Adam]
The Sharmas now fear
they're dealing with police

705
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,280
who are corrupt
and disinterested.

706
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,000
[man speaking in Hindi on
radio]

707
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,920
[Adam]
The women's police cell
leading the anti-dowry campaign

708
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:59,120
has only one van in Delhi.

709
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:03,440
It answers calls all over a city
of 14 million people.

710
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,280
[car honks]

711
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,680
It's really impossible to tell
how many dowry deaths

712
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,880
there are each year.

713
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:13,080
The official figure
is somewhere over 6,500.

714
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,480
Unofficially, you know,

715
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,200
it could be as high as some say
25,000.

716
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,640
Anyway, the unit's
just been called out

717
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,160
to another case.

718
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,760
All we know at the moment
is it involves a woman

719
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,320
being burnt.

720
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,200
Uh, we should find out more
when we arrive in a few minutes.

721
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,760
[man speaking in Hindi]

722
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,440
Yeah, dead body is here,
in the vehicle.

723
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,320
[woman muttering]

724
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,440
[Adam]
The women's cell relies
on being tipped off

725
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,000
by the local police,

726
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,720
who've got to
the scene of the crime first.

727
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,320
They've already made
their minds up, what went on.

728
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,760
So, so what--
what happened in this case?

729
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,840
Burnt.

730
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:51,080
[officer]
Suicide.
Suicide.

731
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,920
Burnt herself.

732
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,160
[Adam]
Apparently, the neighbors
heard no argument

733
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,440
between the couple.

734
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,920
And the woman's parents
aren't here

735
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:02,560
to claim her death
was anything other than suicide.

736
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:06,080
She is saying,
"You eat food" to her husband,

737
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,360
but her husband refused,
because he was ill.

738
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,040
Then after, when he went out
and he--

739
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,520
[officer]
She committed suicide.

740
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,360
[Adam]
So it sounds an odd reason
to commit suicide,

741
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,320
because your husband
refuses to eat food.

742
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,280
This is the husband here?

743
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,480
[officer]
Yeah, yeah.

744
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,960
[woman 1]
Yeah, some cases are like this.

745
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,400
[Adam]
It's often claimed
the police are too quick

746
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,320
to dismiss a case,
because of ineptitude

747
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,480
or corruption.

748
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:30,480
[speaking in Hindi]

749
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,080
Are you getting the impression
that the police have--

750
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,800
have accepted this reason
almost without question?

751
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,080
I think the police
by and large accepts anything

752
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,360
which told to them,

753
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,120
so they don't have to do
much digging

754
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,360
and any investigation in depth.

755
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,880
They first accept
whatever is said

756
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,840
and then if somebody
makes a noise

757
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,920
about its unacceptability,
then they dig it up.

758
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,200
Then they start digging, right.

759
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,520
The paperwork done,

760
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:05,040
the woman's body is driven off
to the nearby mortuary.

761
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,040
Unless a member
of this dead woman's family

762
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,320
now comes and reports
this as a dowry crime,

763
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,000
this death is almost certainly
just gonna become

764
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,560
another meaningless statistic.

765
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,000
Who knows what actually happened
to this woman?

766
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,120
Suicide?

767
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,600
An accident, murder?

768
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,080
I have no idea.

769
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,040
And the police are apparently
not very interested

770
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,360
in finding out.

771
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,800
The body will be cremated
later today.

772
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,560
And the husband will go back
to his home.

773
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,920
Case closed.

774
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,440
Women are killed in India
in horrifying numbers,

775
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,040
because the chance of anyone
being prosecuted is remote.

776
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,520
And the men can go off
and marry again

777
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,040
and get another dowry.

778
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,040
In hospitals in Delhi,

779
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,680
there are case after case
of burned women,

780
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,600
while dowry demands
are getting bigger and bigger.

781
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,360
Could you just,

782
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,520
literally just tell us
what happened?

783
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:21,680
[speaking in Hindi]

784
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,840
[Adam]
Anoki is desperately ill.

785
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,360
She has 80% burns to her body.

786
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,560
Her sister-in-law
caught her hands from the back

787
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:36,280
and uh, the mother-in-law
poured kerosene over her

788
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:39,440
and then set her on fire.

789
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,960
[Adam]
Anoki is the classic
dowry victim.

790
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,840
Not pretty enough,
her dowry wasn't big enough,

791
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:49,000
and then on top of everything,
she gave birth to a girl.

792
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,200
She went--

793
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,280
She was sent home forcibly
she says for--

794
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,560
three years back.

795
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:56,880
And then her parents
went to her in-laws place

796
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,800
to say that
you should take her back.

797
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,800
So they wouldn't do that.

798
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,880
So I asked her,

799
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,760
"Why did they not
take you back?"

800
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,200
She says, "They just said that
they didn't like me."

801
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,400
So basically, you know,

802
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,360
her husband's family
didn't like her, so they--

803
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,480
they burnt her, set her on fire.

804
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,840
Yeah.

805
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,520
[Smita speaking in Hindi]

806
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:20,480
[Adam]
Anoki's father has been sitting
at her bedside for four months.

807
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,400
He says, "What's the point
of getting the police involved?

808
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,800
Nothing would happen,

809
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,240
it would just cause more trouble
for my family."

810
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,720
And they're not prepared
to press charges now,

811
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,480
because they're frightened
of what might happen?

812
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,200
Yeah.

813
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,120
I mean if they can burn her,
then they can do anything.

814
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:43,160
[chattering in background]

815
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,040
[Adam]
And do you get many cases
like this?

816
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:49,240
[muttering]

817
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,840
But we have got plenty of cases,
yes.

818
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,120
Hmm.

819
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:55,960
Of-- of women burned
in similar circumstances?

820
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,400
Most of the-- most of the cases
are--

821
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,760
You do--

822
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,200
Burned by a stove only.

823
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,920
Right.

824
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,720
I mean, you know this--
this woman claims

825
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,520
she was burned by her in-laws.

826
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,480
No, she is not saying that.

827
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,120
[Adam]
Well, she said her mother-in-law
is...

828
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,520
She's not saying that,
she's saying--

829
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,040
[Adam]
Well, that's what
she's just said to us.

830
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,480
[Smita]
The statement--
the statement she has given

831
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,920
is not that.

832
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:20,960
The police statement is that
she's-- it's an accident.

833
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,640
It's an accident, yes.

834
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,880
What she said,[Smita]
[Smita]
what she said to No, but she's--

835
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,160
[Adam]
That what she says
to the police,

836
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,040
but what she's saying to us
is that she was--

837
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,600
she was burned by her in-laws.

838
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,880
I've talked to her,
I've talked to her father also.

839
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,160
They are both saying
the same thing,

840
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,240
it's an accident.

841
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,120
[Adam]
Does it puzzle you,
as a burns doctor,

842
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,720
that there are loads and loads
of these accidents

843
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,800
involving cooking?

844
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,960
Doesn't happen anywhere else
in the world in the same way.

845
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,440
[doctor]
Yeah, it's not happening
in anywhere in the world,

846
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,160
but the main thing is that
the stove that they're using,

847
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,880
I know.
that's a peculiar stove.

848
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,240
I mean you're doing
wonderful things

849
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,720
to look after her,
but it just seems that you know,

850
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:52,480
there are so many cases
like this-- this woman.

851
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,760
And why do you think
she is giving us

852
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,640
a different version events?

853
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,920
[doctor]
I don't know.

854
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,720
Is she frightened?

855
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,240
[doctor]
I don't know that.

856
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,480
I mean you realize when you come
and see

857
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,240
what is a really sickening case
like this,

858
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,280
that they're the odds against
this sort of thing

859
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,800
ever being sorted out.

860
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,440
It's totally stacked against...

861
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,960
And you've got a girl here
who um, said she was burned

862
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,520
by her family.

863
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:21,200
She and her father
don't want to go to the police.

864
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:25,560
There seems to be a reluctance
by the system to investigate it

865
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:30,400
and you're left realizing
the whole thing is hopeless.

866
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,240
[speaking in Hindi]

867
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:36,440
[Adam]
Her father said
he hoped she'd recover.

868
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:39,640
But Anoki died a week later.

869
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:42,440
Afterwards, off-camera,
the doctor admitted

870
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:46,280
that most of the burns cases
were dowry crimes.

871
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:51,520
And Anoki's case remains
as listed, a kitchen accident.

872
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:57,040
[siren wailing]

873
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,800
[Adam]
The women's police cell

874
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,080
and its solitary van
are out on call again.

875
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,760
But they spend
much of their time

876
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,400
dealing with trivial cases.

877
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,160
There's been a report
that a woman has tried

878
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,800
to commit suicide,
because of dowry demands

879
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,520
by her husband.

880
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,280
But when we arrive
an hour later,

881
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,400
that story's being disputed.

882
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,040
The parents say
their daughter-in-law

883
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,960
has been using the dowry law
to blackmail them.

884
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,560
[Adam]
The police have little doubt
that the in-laws

885
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:50,400
were telling the truth.

886
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,960
They go to the hospital
where the woman

887
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:55,040
has admitted herself.

888
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:58,280
And they find that she'd taken
only two sleeping pills,

889
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,560
an attempt to put pressure
on her husband

890
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,080
to give her money.

891
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,920
She hates her in-laws.

892
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,040
[Adam]
Because the woman
alleged dowry abuse,

893
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:31,480
the women's police unit
had to answer the call.

894
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:34,280
Valuable hours wasted
on exactly the sort of case

895
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,600
they shouldn't be dealing with.

896
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:41,600
Meanwhile, serious dowry crime
all over the city is ignored.

897
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,800
It was like this
night after night.

898
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:51,280
The flood of dowry cases
coming to the women's cell

899
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,520
never stops.

900
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,200
Even when they're effective,

901
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:59,920
the police are working with laws
that everyone ignores.

902
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,800
[people chattering]

903
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,240
[Adam]
There've been some recent
and high-profile cases

904
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,520
of young women
resisting dowry demands,

905
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,520
calling off their marriages
on the wedding day.

906
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,880
But these are the exceptions.

907
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,680
[arguing in Hindi]

908
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,760
What are the men doing?

909
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:21,360
Why aren't the young men
outraged by this?

910
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,720
And they're not!

911
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:26,400
And in fact,
precisely because they are not

912
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,360
and they're complicit
in this practice,

913
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,320
which is nothing
but the death warrant

914
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,480
for a young woman.

915
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,160
It's the practice!

916
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,880
It's not just,
at the end of the time,

917
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,440
the killing,
it's the--

918
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:41,760
And if there's no resistance
from young men of this practice,

919
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,800
that's where really
the problem lies.

920
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:47,440
[bell tolling in distance]

921
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,720
[Adam]
The Sharmas have little reason
for optimism.

922
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,080
The police appear
to have dropped

923
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,560
the Kajal investigation.

924
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:57,240
The suicide note
hasn't been examined.

925
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,400
Dr. Singh's gone back at work.

926
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:02,000
And the Sharmas haven't got
the dowry back.

927
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,600
[bell tolling]

928
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,200
[Adam]
The Sharmas, along with other
middle-class families

929
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:15,480
had agreed to barter off
their daughter.

930
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:18,760
A husband bought in exchange
for large sums of money

931
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:21,800
and then constant pressure
for more.

932
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:24,200
By agreeing to play
the dowry system,

933
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:27,120
they and others contribute
to the injustice

934
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:30,400
in Indian society that
they say they are fighting.

935
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:37,320
As far as the delivery
of justice is concerned,

936
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,840
we certainly have
a very long way to go,

937
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:43,120
as far as cases and atrocities
against women are concerned.

938
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:45,680
There's a very low rate
of conviction in India.

939
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:49,640
And we want to ensure that
the Sharma case

940
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:52,560
is not just another statistic,

941
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:56,080
to prove how unjust
the system is.

942
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:58,600
[Adam]
Do you feel like giving up?

943
00:42:58,600 --> 00:42:59,640
Not giving up.

944
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,280
I am not going to give up.

945
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,600
I will fight till the end.

946
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:06,600
Without hoping
for the good result

947
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,720
or bad result like that.

948
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:09,840
[Adam]
Do you think money's--

949
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,280
[woman 2]
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

950
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,800
The most important thing
is money.

951
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,880
[Adam]
'Cause I know your wife has said
right from the beginning,

952
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,080
all she wants is justice.

953
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,120
Will you ever get justice?

954
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:20,680
No, I have got very little hope.

955
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:25,840
