1
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,880
Tell me.

2
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,800
What?

3
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,280
What about the guy?

4
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,800
I was the one who handcuffed him.

5
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,440
What are you saying?
Both of them?

6
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,040
Hey.. Move aside.

7
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,280
Why have you allowed
a crowd to gather?

8
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,760
Send them away.

9
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,840
Listen to us. Move away.

10
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,280
Sir!
- What happened?

11
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,160
Sir, Inspector Mansingh called
and asked for you to come here.

12
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,800
Mansingh has taken
a girl from here.

13
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,520
He has admitted her
at Lifeline hospital.

14
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,400
A boy was handed in their custody.

15
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,880
They were told to interrogate him.
The guy must have done this.

16
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,880
Mansingh had informed
the control room.

17
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,320
I just spoke to him.

18
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,520
He was the one who gave
me these details.

19
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,160
Where is Mansingh?
- He was at the hospital.

20
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,160
He is now on his way here.

21
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,120
Did you contact him on the
walkie-talkie?

22
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,040
He did not reply, sir.

23
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,200
Give me his mobile number.

24
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,000
I have it on my phone, sir.

25
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,560
I tried to call him,
but he did not respond.

26
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,200
Sir, are you the doctor?

27
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,760
Doctor Kanthraj?
- Yes?

28
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,920
I'm ACP Vijay.
I spoke to you over the phone.

29
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,080
Never mind that.

30
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,720
Show me your ID first.

31
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,120
An imposter wearing a police
uniform kidnapped a patient.

32
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,680
I can't believe this, sir.

33
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,600
What's going on here?

34
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,040
Is this enough?

35
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,960
'The vehicle is parked on the road.
He is not in the vehicle.'

36
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,360
Mr. Vijay is here. I'll inform him.

37
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,640
I'll contact you again.

38
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,080
Sir?
Over..

39
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,040
Mansingh isn't answering his phone.
Something's not right.

40
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,640
Sir, we just received information.

41
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,760
The ambulance that took the girl
was found 2 km from here.

42
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,320
The three attenders
were found dead.

43
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,600
Gunshot wounds.

44
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,440
As it was a police vehicle,
I didn't question him.

45
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,600
I don't know when
the Innova entered.

46
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,760
Once the ambulance left, the police
officer who drove this vehicle

47
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,360
left in the Innova.

48
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,560
I found it peculiar,
but dropped it.

49
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,880
What could I have done, sir?
Since he was a police officer

50
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,840
I did not pursue it further.

51
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,960
Okay. Wait there,
I'll call you later. - Thank you!

52
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,240
Rajesh, open the trunk.

53
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,320
What is it, sir?

54
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,680
Mansingh's dead body
will be inside.

55
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,120
What are you saying, sir?

56
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,240
Damn it!

57
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,320
What is happening?

58
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,000
Find the clothes she was wearing

59
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,800
when Mansingh admitted her.

60
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,040
See if you can find anything there.
- Yes, sir.

61
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,120
Sir, there are two
ticket stubs from Satyam Theatre.

62
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,280
Night show.

63
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,280
Give it to me.
- There was nothing else, sir.

64
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,800
The 10:00 p.m. screening.

65
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,040
Sir? - I'm here to meet
the manager. - Is that so?

66
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,480
He is expecting me.
- Okay, sir.

67
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,960
Open the gate.
- Just a minute, sir.

68
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,240
The 10:00 p.m. show, right?
- Yes.

69
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,320
What is it, sir?

70
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,880
Get the footage from the
balcony camera. - Okay, sir.

71
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,080
Isn't this the ground floor?
Show me the balcony.

72
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,400
Sir, these are all the
camera shots from the balcony.

73
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,520
Is this the crowd from
the night show? - Yes.

74
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,280
What about that?
- That too.

75
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,480
Show me that footage.

76
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,840
This is the balcony, sir.

77
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,400
I'm looking for a girl

78
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,880
wearing a pink T-shirt
and black jeans.

79
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,080
Fast forward.
- Okay, sir.

80
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,160
Slow down.

81
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,040
Rewind.

82
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,160
Rewind.. Come back.

83
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,080
H-Hold it.

84
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,360
I think this is the girl.

85
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,640
Who is this?

86
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,720
He is the guy who
came with that girl.

87
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,280
Are there cameras on both sides?

88
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,600
Yes, sir.
- Play it.

89
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,560
Are they on the phone
with each other?

90
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,640
He is talking to him from here.

91
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,280
Is he hiding?

92
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,560
Rewind it.
- Okay.

93
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,440
Freeze it.

94
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,520
Look. My time is precious.

95
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,080
Let it be worthwhile.
- I know, Doctor.

96
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:57,960
Trust me.

97
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,960
Doctor, look at this.

98
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,240
Is she the girl?

99
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,760
Yes, that's her.

100
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,680
Was he the one who impersonated
a cop and took the girl away?

101
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,320
Yes, it definitely was him.

102
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,880
'Control room calling mic 20.
ACP Vijay, please respond.'

103
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,240
Yes. Receiving. Tell me.

104
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,760
'Sir, this is the control room.'

105
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,880
'We received a call from a man.'

106
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,680
'He saw a guy hitting a girl'

107
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,640
'who matches the
description you gave us'

108
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,080
'and carrying her away
in an Innova.'

109
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:35,520
'The man called at once.
The girl was seen wearing'

110
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,880
'a pink T-shirt and black jeans.'

111
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,880
'Approximately 45 minutes later'

112
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,320
'he claims to have seen the same
vehicle again at ECR road.'

113
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,680
'The man followed the vehicle'

114
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,480
'to a house and called
us from there.'

115
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,440
'We told him that the
police would take over from here.'

116
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,680
'We asked him to leave.'

117
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:56,000
Okay. - 'Since it matches
the description'

118
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,400
'we are informing you.'

119
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,640
'The man has given us an address,
sir.'

120
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,120
'His mobile number is..'
- Give me the address.

121
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,080
7/11, Meenakshi Illam

122
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,120
Samudra Avenue, Neelangarai.

123
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,840
We don't have a warrant, sir
He said he'll send backup.

124
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,760
If necessary,
you can scout the house.

125
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,360
If it is him, the suspect is armed.

126
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,360
Three policemen have died.
Be cautious.

127
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,680
What is it?
- I love you.

128
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,440
I love you too.

129
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,600
I feel like I've gone crazy,
Sukanya.

130
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,400
I feel like I'm flying.

131
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,120
You've done something to me.
I'm crazy about you.

132
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,320
I'm smiling.

133
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,960
I'm just getting started.

134
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,560
All I did was kiss you once, Arjun.

135
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,920
You're the one who was scared
that my parents would see.

136
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,800
If you want,
come and get another one.

137
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,120
Hey, are you sure?
- Yes.

138
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,480
Shall I come upstairs?

139
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,760
You said you can't get out
of the house.

140
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,200
I am downstairs.

141
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,760
What? No way!

142
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,840
Hey!
- Arjun, what are you doing here?

143
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,840
Please, there is no one at home.

144
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,240
Just come.

145
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,840
We can return by
4:00 a.m. tomorrow.

146
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,920
Stop it!
If my father finds out

147
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,680
we'll never be able to be
together this lifetime.

148
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,320
Arjun, leave!

149
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,400
Think about it.

150
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,920
Has he ever come to your
room to check on you

151
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,800
after going to bed?

152
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,120
No! Because he knows
that you are a good girl.

153
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,640
Say goodnight to your
parents and go to your room.

154
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,240
After that, come out.

155
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,400
Please!
- Arjun!

156
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,720
You said so yourself.
Just one kiss.

157
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,720
But that kiss should be the
longest kiss in the world.

158
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,360
At my place, in my room.

159
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,360
Come.
- I can't.

160
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,680
Don't think about why.

161
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,240
Just think how.

162
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,320
Are you going to come out through
the balcony, or the front door?

163
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,960
Sukanya, please!

164
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,880
W-Wait, hold on.

165
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,720
Where?

166
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,360
I watched this movie yesterday.

167
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,760
Seriously?
- Yes.

168
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,480
Why don't we watch another film?
- Big deal.

169
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,840
I just want to sit
beside you in the theatre.

170
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,720
The movie doesn't matter to me.

171
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,200
I'm hungry.

172
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,000
What do you want to eat?

173
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,440
Popcorn.
- Anything else? - No. - Coffee?

174
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,400
No.
- Sure?

175
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,840
Just popcorn. Come back soon.
- I'll be back.

176
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,400
'Who, him?'

177
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,680
'He is a demon.'

178
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,200
'You can't escape him.'

179
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,040
'Pack your bags and leave.'

180
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,720
'That's what's best for you.'

181
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,160
'That will be futile.'

182
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,160
'He will come'

183
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,240
'no matter where you are.'

184
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,680
'He is omnipotent.'

185
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,720
'That's usually said about
God. But he is the devil.'

186
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:12,960
'Dig a trench and hide inside.'

187
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,560
'Do you understand?'

188
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,960
'I assure you. He will come.'

189
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,720
'The number you are trying to reach
is currently switched off.'

190
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,400
He just came to buy popcorn.

191
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,920
He was wearing a white
T-shirt and jeans.

192
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:13,520
Where? - 'The number you're trying
to reach is switched off.'

193
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,400
Thanks.

194
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,760
'The number you are
trying to reach..'

195
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,160
'The number you are trying to reach
is currently switched off.'

196
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,440
Sukanya?

197
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,200
I am Veera.

198
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,640
Oh! Hi.

199
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,480
It's been years
since I last saw you.

200
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,480
Are you fine?

201
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,120
Yes. - It's been about five years,
right? - I'm fine.

202
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,400
Do you live in Chennai?

203
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,440
Yes, I do.
- I haven't seen you around here.

204
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,520
That's why I asked.
What did you do after school?

205
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:23,840
Well..

206
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,120
Look, I-I'm in a hurry.
I have to go.

207
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,600
Did you happen to see Arjun?

208
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,880
Oh! Did you come with him?

209
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,760
Are you with him? Yes..

210
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,720
I saw him.
- When?

211
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,280
He just left in a car.

212
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,080
Swathi was driving.

213
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,520
It was a Zen.

214
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,200
I didn't speak to them.
I was sitting in the car.

215
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,240
You showed up five
minutes later. I was wondering

216
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,840
how all my classmates
were at the same place.

217
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,440
But I had to come and talk to you.

218
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,600
Swathi?
- Yes, Swathi.

219
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,560
She studied with us.
They just left in a Zen.

220
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,280
Just five minutes ago.

221
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,040
Are you sure?
- Yes.

222
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,480
Why? Any problem?

223
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,240
Nothing.

224
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,640
Sukanya!

225
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,200
Are you going home?

226
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:21,880
Come, I'll drop you.

227
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,080
Will you drop me?
- Yes, sure.

228
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,400
I live in Adayar. - Just come.
I'll drop you No problem.

229
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,240
Come, sit.

230
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,400
Thanks.
- No problem.

231
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,680
It's none of my business.
But despite coming with you

232
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,960
did he leave with her
without telling you?

233
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,400
That's bad.

234
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,640
It's been a while
since I met Arjun.

235
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,120
I met Swathi a few times.

236
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,160
After completing my 10th,
I didn't study here.

237
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,720
I went to a
boarding school in Ooty.

238
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,240
I graduated from a
college in Bangalore.

239
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,560
Engineering. What about you?

240
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,600
I studied here.

241
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,400
Stella.

242
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,160
Oh! Okay.

243
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,680
I'm not in touch with
anyone from our batch

244
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,880
as I went to Ooty to study.

245
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,800
I missed it all.

246
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,400
I returned from Bangalore in April.

247
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,720
I'm work at Satyam
as a project manager.

248
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,160
I am set.

249
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,760
I've been trying to contact you.

250
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,200
It was then that I saw
you at the theatre.

251
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,200
I couldn't believe it.

252
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,320
Are you working?

253
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:08,960
Yes.

254
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,320
You know, I'm sorry.

255
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,560
I can't think straight.

256
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,400
We'll meet some other
time and talk.

257
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,040
I just need to get home now.
I'm sorry.

258
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:28,840
Darn! I'm sorry, I kept talking.

259
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,440
You must be really upset.

260
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,480
There must have been a problem.

261
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,800
Else, he wouldn't have left like
he did without informing you.

262
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,840
He will surely call you up.

263
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,760
Maybe they thought they could
return before the movie ended.

264
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,640
Whatever it was,
he should have informed you.

265
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,360
That's what I would have done.

266
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,720
I wouldn't have gone at all.

267
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,320
That is different.

268
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,320
Take a right here.

269
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,600
Oh! You said you lived
in Adayar, right?

270
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,760
It is close to Adayar. Not a
lot of people know Kanakam.

271
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,120
I take this road every day.

272
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,680
My office is situated on OMR.

273
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,560
Is there a residential area here?

274
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,520
Yes.
- Oh, okay.

275
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,400
Make an U-turn here.

276
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,600
Hey,
I told you to take a U-turn.

277
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,440
I'll turn back after I speak
to you for two minutes.

278
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,320
I don't know if
I'll get the chance again.

279
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,360
It's been so long.

280
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,880
I'm just not in the mood.
I really need to get home.

281
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,320
Please take this U-turn.
- Okay. Okay.

282
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,400
Please!
- Okay.

283
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,400
Sorry!

284
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,280
I just thought that

285
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,760
you'd have got home late, if you'd
watched the whole movie.

286
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,080
Take a left here.

287
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,120
Can we meet again, Sukanya?

288
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,440
Let's see.
I'm very busy with work.

289
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:39,640
Oh, I see.
Can I have your phone number?

290
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,800
Give me your number.
I'll call you.

291
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,640
My father questions me about
who I'm on the phone with.

292
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,280
He is very strict.

293
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,320
I'll call you up.

294
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,680
When we're free, we can meet.

295
00:19:59,040 --> 00:19:59,840
Okay.

296
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,160
9884055116.

297
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,840
Sure.

298
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,200
Take a left here.

299
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,280
Stop by that car.

300
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,280
You have crossed it. Stop!

301
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,160
Just two minutes. Please?

302
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,840
No. Not now.

303
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,880
I'm really getting late.
I have to go. Just stop the car.

304
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,680
Okay, turn here and stop.
I'll walk from here.

305
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,600
What is wrong with you?
I told you to stop.

306
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,840
I'm going to get off.
Nonsense!

307
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,240
What?

308
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,600
Sukanya? Sukanya?

309
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,160
I hope she is not dead. Sukanya!

310
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,720
Sukanya!

311
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,960
Sukanya!

312
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,640
Sukanya! I'm sorry.

313
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,800
Just listen to me. Okay, I'm sorry.

314
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,480
Leave me.
- Just one minute.

315
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,880
Just listen to me. Sukanya!

316
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,200
Come here!
- No!

317
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,680
Sukanya! Don't go there!

318
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,600
Come here. Hey!
- No.

319
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,480
Open the door.

320
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,360
Stop the car!
- Sukanya! Hey!

321
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,160
Stop the car!
- Listen to me.

322
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,240
Hey!
- I'll kill you.

323
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,200
No! Listen to me.

324
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,440
Don't go there.

325
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,640
Open.

326
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,560
Arjun!

327
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,840
Arjun!

328
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,080
What have you done?

329
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,520
I'll kill you..
- Hey!

330
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,200
Hey!

331
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,440
Sukanya!

332
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,480
You refused to give
me your phone number.

333
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,800
'My father is very strict.'

334
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,480
But there is no problem
when Arjun calls you, right?

335
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,440
You scaled the balcony
and jumped over wall.

336
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,080
Look at what happened.

337
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,280
Why did you kill him?

338
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,840
I didn't like him.

339
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,480
I have seen you both
together many times.

340
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,960
It was unbearable.

341
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,240
That is why.

342
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,240
I didn't plan anything, Sukanya.

343
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,560
I just planned to
follow you as usual.

344
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,680
An idea struck me when I saw him
by himself at the theatre.

345
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,880
That I would get a chance
to be with you today.

346
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,200
I kept talking and
lead him to the car.

347
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,560
He started off by saying that he
was madly in love with you

348
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,000
and that he
planned on marrying you.

349
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,800
I hit him once and he
fell unconscious.

350
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,320
I thought for a minute.

351
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,120
I killed him.

352
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,360
Hey!

353
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,680
The vehicle seems to be dragging
in a peculiar manner.

354
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,760
Don't give me a flat tire, baby.

355
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,080
Hello! What is it, Sukanya?

356
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,240
Hey!

357
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,600
Help! Help!
- Stop..

358
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,720
Save me!

359
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,280
Hey!

360
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,200
What the hell is going on?

361
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,480
My girlfriend. She is drunk.

362
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,120
There is no other way.
Please mind your own business, sir.

363
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,680
No problem.

364
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,880
Don't you ever do that again!
I'll kill you!

365
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,080
It will all be in vain. Being in
love with you for over a year.

366
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:39,360
Following you around.

367
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,520
I know everything about you,
Sukanya.

368
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,920
Your friends,
your parents, your sister

369
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,560
your moods,
your favourite music, your Arjun

370
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,800
your favourite food,
your favourite dress

371
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,800
your favourite books. I even know
your favourite brand of underwear.

372
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,040
I spend at least two
days a week in your room.

373
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,720
When you're asleep at night,
I've even licked your leg.

374
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,320
This is love! Love!

375
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,720
If I were to come and confess
that I liked you

376
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,760
you would've told me that
you were in love with Arjun.

377
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,000
That is why I killed him.

378
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,360
He's out of the picture.
- Arjun.

379
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,720
Even now, if you say yes

380
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,680
we'll get rid of him
and go away to some place.

381
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,480
Nobody has to know.

382
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,720
I'll give you the best life ever.

383
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,440
Sukanya!

384
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,000
What are you doing?

385
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,040
Leave me!
- She stabbed me with a knife.

386
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,240
Wild cat.
- Let go.

387
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,480
Have you heard of them?

388
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,000
She fought like that.

389
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,880
What a girl!

390
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,440
Sad!

391
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,840
Hey, open the door. Open.

392
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,800
Hey, open the door. Open.

393
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,880
Hey, open the door. Open.
- Sukanya. Sir!

394
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,840
Open it.
- One minute.

395
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,640
Sir,
they stabbed me with a knife.

396
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,760
Get out. Get out.
- I didn't do anything.

397
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,320
Sir, they stabbed me.
- What did you do to her?

398
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,480
I stepped out to check
if it was a flat tyre.

399
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,200
They were wearing a
blue shirt and jeans.

400
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,880
Who?
- Three of them.

401
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,320
Who?
- They stabbed her as well! - Stay!

402
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,760
Sir..

403
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,240
Ma'am? Hello?

404
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,480
What happened? Ma'am!

405
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,280
Help..

406
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,200
Sir! What happened?
- Keep quiet.

407
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,600
Sir, please! Tell me.

408
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,920
Is she okay, sir?

409
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,360
Are you okay, Ma'am?

410
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,080
Are you coming?

411
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,240
Come fast.

412
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,160
Hey, what did you do to her?

413
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,600
Sir, I didn't do anything.

414
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,720
It looked like I had a flat tyre.

415
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,880
I halted the car to check
when three guys attacked me.

416
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,720
They tried to do
something to her as well.

417
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,880
I fought back.

418
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,400
They wore a black shirt and jeans.

419
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,760
They had a knife.
When I turned around..

420
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,720
They stabbed me and I fainted.

421
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,880
What's your name?

422
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,360
Karthik! - What's her name?
- She is my girlfriend Radhika.

423
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,480
I didn't do anything, sir.

424
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,120
Come.
- My hands hurt. Please, sir.

425
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,200
What happened?
- That girl has been stabbed.

426
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,880
He has been stabbed
in the shoulder.

427
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,840
I will take her to the hospital.
- Go..

428
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,600
I will take her to the nearby
hospital, Life Line.

429
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,680
I think a gang of guys
have tried to do something.

430
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,120
He is lying.

431
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,320
Sir! Sir! No.
- Hey, wait.

432
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,640
That girl will tell the truth.

433
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,760
Remove his handcuffs.

434
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,160
Take him down to the
station and bandage his wounds

435
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,720
Check the car thoroughly.

436
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,840
Start questioning him.
I will be back by then.

437
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,640
Come. Help me.

438
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,600
Come here.

439
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,200
Careful.

440
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,960
Okay.

441
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,440
The key to the handcuffs.
- Okay, sir.

442
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,960
Also, book him
for tinting the car windows.

443
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,600
Hey, get up.
- Sir.

444
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,840
Stand.
- Come.

445
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,400
Were you stabbed?

446
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,200
It's a small wound. Nothing major.

447
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,000
Take him to the station.
- Come.

448
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,320
Get inside.
- What happened?

449
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,360
What did they do? Tell me.
- Hey!

450
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,280
Hey! Hey!

451
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,280
Hey!
Hey!

452
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,920
Catch him!
- Let go!

453
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,800
My gun!

454
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,680
How is she, Doctor?

455
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,160
The wound is not too deep.
- Okay.

456
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,160
Her vital organs were not affected.

457
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,120
She still has to be taken
to the OR and given sutures.

458
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,160
But she is fine.
- Okay, Doctor.

459
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,240
Where and how did it happen?

460
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,680
Tell me.

461
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,800
What?

462
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,960
Yes. What about that guy?

463
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,080
I was the one who handcuffed him.

464
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,240
What are you saying?

465
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,160
Yes. I handed him over to them.

466
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,280
Okay. Note down the details.

467
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:47,760
He was driving an Innova car.
He is slim and sports a beard.

468
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,320
He was wearing a light blue shirt.

469
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,320
Yes.

470
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,400
I'm in charge of this case now,
Doctor.

471
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,560
This is the central minister's
daughter.

472
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,080
You don't have to be involved.
I am shifting her to GH.

473
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,360
That's the protocol.

474
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,520
So, is she okay to travel?

475
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,400
That's your problem.

476
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:51,480
Excuse me!
- I said, 'That's your problem'.

477
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,960
Oh!
- Yes. Protocol!

478
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,160
Royapettah, GH.

479
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,120
What happened, sir?

480
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:09,040
Tyson. Hey, come here!

481
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,640
Tyson, come here!

482
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,160
Come here.

483
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,600
Are you surprised by the uniform?

484
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,400
It belongs to someone else.

485
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:23,000
It's not mine. Doesn't it stink?

486
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,560
I will take it off.
I even have a gun.

487
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,120
Good boy.

488
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,440
What are you looking at?
Are you wondering who she is?

489
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,240
Come here. Come here.

490
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,840
She might get scared
if she sees you.

491
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,960
You shouldn't scare her. Okay?

492
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,880
Go. Go!

493
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,120
Ms. Meenakshi?

494
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,000
Nothing. I'll be right back.

495
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:31,520
I've never had trouble with the
numerous girls before her.

496
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,920
No police. Not a single question.

497
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:39,000
But I had to face a lot of
trouble to bring her home.

498
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,040
Just for her.

499
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,440
What else? That's it.

500
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,520
My..

501
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:00,920
Thank God, sir!
His.. His name is Veera.

502
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,280
He..

503
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,920
Stop crying. Hey!

504
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:35,080
You are where you belong.
This is my house.

505
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,000
Welcome home, Sukanya.

506
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,760
Please! Don't cry.

507
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,320
You will find everything
you need here.

508
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,320
It's just for a year.

509
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,800
Then, it will all be okay.

510
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,080
Forget everyone else.

511
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,120
Okay?

512
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,400
Be with me. Please!

513
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,360
I will leave you alone for a while.

514
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,000
You must understand something.

515
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,240
You can only leave
here if I allow it.

516
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,800
Hereafter,
this will be your everything.

517
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:07,520
It will be best
for you and everyone

518
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,080
if you keep that in mind
and stay here. Okay?

519
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,440
Hello! Hello, sir.

520
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,120
Sir, is this the police station?

521
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,560
Nothing.
- What happened?

522
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,680
She stabbed me with a knife.

523
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,480
Police, hospital..
It was a huge mess.

524
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,800
Don't kill me.

525
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,520
What are you doing?

526
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,760
I will not run around to help
you if you're in trouble.

527
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,360
I can't.

528
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,720
There has been no trouble so far.

529
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,800
You won't have to face anything.

530
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,720
It's all your fault.
- It's all because of you.

531
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,320
From where did you bring her?
What was the need for it now?

532
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,560
You say that the police
is involved.

533
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,520
Many people will come
in search of her, Veera.

534
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:21,360
I need her. She was my
classmate in 10th standard.

535
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:22,800
I love her.

536
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,520
Shit!

537
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,360
Damn it!

538
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,560
She is not like the other girls.

539
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,920
You should talk to her.
You will really like her.

540
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,760
But she doesn't like me.

541
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,640
I will make her do
all the work for you.

542
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:25,040
She will do all the
work for you in my absence.

543
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,080
Think about it.

544
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,360
What are you going to
do about those girls?

545
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,680
I'll kill them.

546
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,280
Don't come near me.

547
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,640
No.

548
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,880
Don't!

549
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,800
Leave her. Let go of her, please.

550
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,400
Let me go!

551
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,080
Let me go!

552
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,080
I don't like her.

553
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,200
Kill her as well.

554
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,960
I don't need anybody else here.

555
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,040
She is not fit for you.

556
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,720
She will never accept you.
I know it.

557
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:42,840
Listen to me, she's trouble.

558
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,680
Kill her. Right now.

559
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:47,200
Leave no sign that she was here.

560
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,320
No. Please, Ms. Meenakshi.

561
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,040
Just do what I say.
- Hey, Veera.

562
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,320
I'll do anything..
- Answer me

563
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,520
Who else has seen
the two of you?

564
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,560
How much more trouble
will she bring?

565
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:06,680
Nobody who saw us is alive.

566
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:11,200
Just a doctor at the hospital.
But that's nothing.

567
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,160
But I need her.

568
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,520
Her..
- Kill her, Veera. Now!

569
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,640
Else, I will..
- No.

570
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,760
No. Just go.

571
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,320
Go. I will take care of everything.

572
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:28,680
Go!

573
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,160
She will stay here.

574
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,480
You are jealous again.

575
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,200
Like always.

576
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,480
You hate it when I'm
with someone else.

577
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,800
It started with Sandhya,
and now, even her.

578
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,960
Oh, God! Please! Please!

579
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,720
Get him, my babies! Eat!

580
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,240
Hello?

581
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:03,960
Shit!

582
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,640
Okay, come.
- No.

583
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:20,000
Are you going to kill me?

584
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,200
Please!
- Don't cry.

585
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,400
No. No.
- Hey! Hey!

586
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:28,320
Please! No!
- No, it's nothing!

587
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,000
Just come.

588
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,320
Come out. Come!
- Let go of me!

589
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:37,720
No.
- Come.

590
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:44,960
Hey, what happened?

591
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,800
Okay, take care. Please!

592
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,000
Are you okay?

593
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,920
Come here. Just here.

594
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:08,520
Isn't it nice here?

595
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:12,360
I always sit here.

596
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:18,320
Hey!
Does your stomach still hurt?

597
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,080
Does it hurt a lot?

598
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:23,440
I'm sorry, okay?

599
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:25,280
I didn't stab you.

600
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:30,240
That was Samar.

601
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:33,280
Not me. Don't you know?

602
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:35,720
Samar stabbed you.

603
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:46,680
I woke up when that cop
knocked on the window.

604
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,480
You were bleeding and I got scared.

605
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:56,440
Samar is the bad one.

606
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:58,920
I would never do something
like that.

607
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:01,760
It was Samar who hit you.

608
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:06,240
I love you. I'd never hit you.

609
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:12,360
I have saved two girls from
Samar and kept them locked here.

610
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:14,880
It's been two years.

611
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,760
If I let them go,
I will get caught.

612
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,560
He has caused me
a lot of trouble.

613
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:22,080
I don't know what to do, Sukanya.

614
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:25,960
Sukanya! it was Samar
who killed Meenakshi as well.

615
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:29,800
Fire. He didn't like the
fact that she was getting married.

616
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:30,680
Veera!

617
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:33,960
I..

618
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,920
I saved her and brought her out.

619
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,360
A blazing fire.

620
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:40,680
Look!

621
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:42,760
Did you see?

622
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,040
She is no more.

623
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:49,960
She is dead.

624
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,160
She was in the
hospital for eight months.

625
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:54,600
One fine day, she died.

626
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:58,840
I brought her here.

627
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:01,240
I buried her here.

628
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:03,480
In the backyard.

629
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,200
That side.

630
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:11,760
Samar thinks that she
is still alive.

631
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:13,120
He talks to her.

632
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,560
Ms. Meenakshi!

633
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:19,200
He will do anything for her.

634
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:21,680
He behaves like she exists.

635
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,960
She is the only one he fears.

636
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,840
I am scared of him.
- It's all because of you.

637
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:32,440
Don't cry.

638
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:45,800
I have been in love with you
ever since we were in school.

639
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:47,360
Since tenth grade.

640
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,400
After school, I was unaware
of your whereabouts.

641
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,040
There was a girl named Sandhya.

642
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:55,600
I was happy when I was with her.

643
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,560
I thought it was love.

644
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:58,760
But that was not love.

645
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,240
It was just a feeling.

646
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:03,640
I brought her home one day.

647
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:06,080
I'll always be online on chat.

648
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,600
Sadly, she is no longer alive.

649
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:09,840
She is dead.

650
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,000
It was Samar.

651
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:14,240
who..

652
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:18,520
Killed her.

653
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:22,200
Can I kiss you?

654
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:26,080
Please, Sukanya!

655
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,480
I love you.

656
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,040
Please! Don't refuse.

657
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:35,160
No.
- Don't refuse. Please!

658
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,800
Please! No.

659
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:49,800
Hey!

660
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:53,080
Sukanya, are you okay?

661
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:55,840
What happened?

662
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:01,000
Sit..

663
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,320
Okay..

664
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:05,880
Where were we?

665
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:08,280
The kiss, right?

666
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:23,600
Come.
I will take you somewhere.

667
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:25,480
Come.

668
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,040
Come, Sukanya.

669
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:30,560
Come.

670
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,160
Come.

671
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:40,120
No..

672
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:46,320
Leave me.
- Come.

673
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,600
Take your shirt off.
- No.

674
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,480
Nothing will happen. Come.

675
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:55,120
I will take care of you.
- Please listen.

676
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:58,880
Sukanya! I have watched you many
times at the GRT swimming pool.

677
00:51:58,960 --> 00:51:59,760
Come!

678
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:02,280
No.

679
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:06,880
Come!
- Let go!

680
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:09,320
Get in.

681
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,640
Don't look at me. Close your eyes.

682
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:32,200
Swim, baby. Please, Sukanya.
Let's have a good time!

683
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:04,240
I think it's going to rain.

684
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:07,480
It's raining!

685
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:57,240
Go, Tyson! Go, Lexi.
Don't lose her! Sukanya! Don't run!

686
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:23,760
Charge!

687
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:36,600
A warrant can't be arranged.
He said he'll send backup.

688
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:41,680
You can scout the house
if necessary.

689
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:01,400
Good job..

690
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:03,080
Lexi, Tyson, don't leave her.

691
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,200
Calm down.

692
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:08,760
Hey!

693
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,520
Stay away. Stay..

694
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:21,360
Hi, my name is Samar.

695
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:23,200
Nice to meet you, Sukanya.

696
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:28,200
Hey! Hey!

697
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:33,240
I told him numerous times

698
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,880
that there's no use
talking to you gently.

699
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:37,200
But he never listens to me.

700
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:42,320
Come. Go, my babies!

701
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:48,480
Come.

702
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:53,360
What happened, Sukanya?

703
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,840
Everything was fine
in swimming pool.

704
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:59,280
I wished to be there
with you my entire life.

705
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:02,280
It was so beautiful.
What happened then?

706
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:03,240
Why did you hit me?

707
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:06,800
You could have told
me if you didn't like it.

708
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,040
I wouldn't have forced you.

709
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:09,720
Oh,
were you pretending to hit me?

710
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:11,120
Oh!

711
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:18,640
Come! Won't you ever
give me what I ask for?

712
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:21,200
Can't you talk to me
for five minutes?

713
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:22,400
Five minutes!

714
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:25,600
Now, wait and watch. You will
stay here for a long time.

715
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:28,160
Come. First, you stab me

716
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:30,000
and now, you slapped me.

717
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:33,280
Where did you get this
habit of hitting others?

718
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:55,160
Come.

719
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:00,840
Come.

720
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:17,280
I'm trying to be nice to you.

721
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,480
But you won't let me. Right?

722
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:43,560
It's been two years since
the two of them came here.

723
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:45,680
Her name is Sharada.
Her name is Revati.

724
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:48,960
You can ask them about
what I've done to them.

725
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,080
You'll reform only if I keep you
here.

726
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:02,280
It's my fault that he
wanted to keep you happy.

727
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:06,480
You slapped me.

728
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:09,480
I'm going to..

729
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:11,960
I'm going to..

730
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:20,560
Come. Come. Look at what
I'm going to do to you.

731
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:21,720
Come!

732
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:24,160
Come!

733
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:37,720
Let us start by washing your hair..

734
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:42,280
And then?

735
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:16,720
Be careful with her hair.
Don't get blood on it.

736
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:18,440
I want her hair.

737
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:37,080
Shit!

738
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:10,480
Help me!

739
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:28,080
Oh, no!
Tyson!

740
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:32,840
Leave! Go away from here!

741
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:34,120
Run away.

742
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:38,440
Ms. Meenakshi!

743
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:49,000
He is not here.
- Where is he?

744
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:51,160
No. No.
- Where is he now?

745
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:05,000
He went that way..
- Look inside.

746
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:18,480
It's not possible.
It can't be unlocked.

747
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:23,040
Do something.. Please!

748
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:24,240
You can kill him.

749
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:27,200
Hey! What are you doing?

750
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:37,120
Please. Please don't..
What are you doing?

751
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:38,320
Don't.

752
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:42,800
Don't go. Please!

753
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:46,880
Hey, who's there?

754
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:48,560
This is the police.

755
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:57,000
Police!
- Run away! Escape!

756
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:00,680
I'll kill you!

757
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:12,240
What do you know?
What do you know about me?

758
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:15,080
How did you know
that I was here?

759
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:16,880
Was the guy who came
here earlier a cop?

760
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:18,280
Have you come alone?
Or is there a force on the way?

761
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:21,080
I must leave this place.

762
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,120
What kind of a person shoots a dog?

763
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:35,960
Meenakshi, bring me that gun!

764
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:37,400
I will kill you.

765
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:45,800
Get the gun, Meenakshi!

766
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:48,160
Shoot him!

767
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:50,680
Shoot him!

768
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:06,600
Meenakshi, come on..
Shoot him!

769
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:08,600
Come, shoot him.

770
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:23,840
Meenakshi!

771
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,440
Why did you shoot me, Meenakshi?

772
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:29,160
Is this how you repay me
for taking care of you?

773
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:33,360
It's okay. You did well.

774
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:35,960
Don't cry..
Okay, give me the gun.

775
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:39,640
Meenakshi!

776
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:46,120
Meenakshi..

777
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:51,840
I'm here. You're fine. Hang on.

778
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:05,600
Don't touch me.

779
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:06,960
Leave.

780
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:10,040
No..

781
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:14,840
Come.

782
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,080
I saw him

783
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:37,360
for the first time
when I was school.

784
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:41,000
He was in my class.

785
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:44,400
Tenth standard.

786
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:47,600
I've never spoken to him..
- Roll.

787
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:49,400
...when we were in school.

788
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:52,000
After schooldays..
- Slightly.

789
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:55,160
...I saw him again at Satyam
Cinemas that day.

790
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:58,240
I was eight years old.
My father..

791
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:02,120
My very own father.
He was a horrible man.

792
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:04,200
He is the reason why
I turned out like this.

793
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:07,480
What could I have done?

794
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:10,160
Bombay.

795
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:13,040
Mumbai.

796
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:18,480
Even if I close my eyes and try.
I can't recall Bombay.

797
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:24,000
I only remember my father's face.

798
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:28,160
I only remember what he did to me.

799
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:31,640
You would have
never seen such things.

800
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:33,720
Shit! Shit!

801
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:38,640
Samar, my boy! Come! Come!

802
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:41,120
Why are you calling him?
- Come.

803
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:44,760
Come..

804
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:49,960
Come, Son.

805
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:52,520
Are you unable to sleep?

806
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:54,880
Come.

807
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:58,960
The girls were not foreigners.
They were from our country.

808
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:07,040
Mallika. - Hi.
- That's Anila.

809
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:08,680
Reena. Say hello.
- Hello!

810
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:11,600
You guys continue. Just carry on.
Don't worry, babe.

811
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,920
I was eight, I didn't
understand a thing.

812
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:18,280
By the time I turned nine

813
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:20,200
I knew enough to
write a book about it.

814
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:29,840
Samar.

815
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:32,760
Samar?

816
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:36,440
Samar.

817
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:40,720
Bye, Samar!
- Bye!

818
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:43,640
From the age of eight to thirteen

819
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:47,600
I was under a demon.

820
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:19,160
One fine day, she..

821
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:22,040
She came into my life
like an angel.

822
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,760
She was the one who
taught me that word.

823
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:44,480
Yes, I called you two hours ago.

824
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:46,680
It rang. But you didn't pick up.

825
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:49,360
Oh, is it?

826
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:53,640
Yes, of course.
I reached before 2:30 p.m.

827
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:56,040
I was bored as I had
no work at office.

828
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:59,520
What's your plan?
Come home. I'm at home.

829
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:02,560
Is that so?

830
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:14,400
Hi!

831
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:17,960
What's your name?

832
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:20,800
Don't you understand Tamil?

833
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:22,480
Yes, I do.

834
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:25,520
What's your name?
- Samar.

835
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:27,200
Why are you sitting here?

836
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:30,520
Are you okay?

837
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:33,520
Yes.

838
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:05,080
Hi!

839
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:08,280
Hi!

840
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:10,320
How are you?

841
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:15,760
Are you okay?

842
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:18,800
Samar, where did you go?

843
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:21,680
Samar!

844
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:24,720
What are you doing?
- Nothing. - Come inside.

845
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:27,760
Why did you go out
without telling me?

846
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:30,240
Why not?

847
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:05,080
Hey, where are you going?
What's your problem? Hey..

848
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:08,880
It was good. Okay.

849
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:20,320
Come on.

850
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:29,840
Let's make this interesting.

851
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:31,920
Whose key is this? Come on..
- Disgusting!

852
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:32,920
Pink isn't gay.

853
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:37,560
Are you ready?
- What's wrong with it?

854
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,120
Do you want to go out and..

855
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:42,600
Just leave the boy alone.

856
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:46,400
I wouldn't have come
had I known there were kids.

857
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:48,720
Chill..
- Come let's go..

858
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:54,000
Yes, totally.
- Sir!

859
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:57,080
What should we do? We won't
have to use guns, will we?

860
01:13:57,160 --> 01:13:58,680
Yes, but there is a child inside.

861
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:00,040
Go..

862
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:03,320
Who is that?
- Attack.

863
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:05,960
Who are you? Who are you?
- I don't know..

864
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:08,280
Who are you?
What's your name?

865
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:11,400
Please, sir! - Two people
ran upstairs, go after them.

866
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:12,280
Go search there.

867
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:17,320
Die, rascal!
- Dad!

868
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:18,720
There is a child here. Careful!

869
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:22,920
You're shooting at a child, rascal!
- I won't shoot..

870
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,640
No!
- Hey..

871
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:31,160
It's okay.

872
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:34,040
Come here.

873
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:38,480
Don't cry. I am here for you.

874
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:41,840
It's going to be fine.

875
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:46,840
I will look after him.
I will become his guardian.

876
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:50,360
He will live with me.
- Okay.

877
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:56,200
She was my neighbour.

878
01:14:57,880 --> 01:15:00,680
After that day,
that became my world.

879
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:04,160
There's no need to turn off
the light. Let it stay on.

880
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:07,280
You will be okay.

881
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:14,200
Don't worry. I am there. Okay?

882
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:17,560
Sleep.
- She was with me for two years.

883
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:21,040
I was everything to her,
and she was everything to me.

884
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:25,880
I don't know why she did all that.

885
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:28,960
She sent me to school.

886
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:30,560
She bought me new clothes.

887
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:32,000
She looked after me very well.

888
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:34,080
She told me that I would
no longer be known as Samar.

889
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:35,680
She said that my
name would be Veera.

890
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:38,080
Veera.
- Come, let's go.

891
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:39,440
I will drop you today.

892
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:41,960
Have you taken your books?
- Yes.

893
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:44,080
Do you have your ID card?
- Yes, it's in my bag.

894
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:53,640
Ms. Meenakshi! One minute.

895
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:55,240
Just come in.
- What?

896
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:56,800
Come. I want to show you something.

897
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:00,320
Come.

898
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:02,480
He lived with me for two years.

899
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:05,200
I looked after
Veera as my own son.

900
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:10,280
Isn't it nice?

901
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:12,920
Is it nice?
- Very nice.

902
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:14,960
Rs. 1,000.

903
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:19,400
All the money you
have given me is over.

904
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:21,440
So what? I will give you more.

905
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:25,200
Happy Birthday!
- Thank you.

906
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:29,200
Thank you so much.
- I don't know when it happened.

907
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:30,960
I began to lose her.

908
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:46,160
All of sudden,
I started having nightmares.

909
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:47,720
Every night.

910
01:16:49,240 --> 01:16:50,200
Dreams of my past life.

911
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:09,920
Ms. Meenakshi!

912
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:12,840
Ms. Meenakshi!

913
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:14,520
I am getting scared.

914
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,160
I am getting scared.

915
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:20,600
Veera, what happened?

916
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:22,400
I'm having nightmares.

917
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:24,760
I am terrified.

918
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:26,680
I am getting scared.
- What?

919
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,200
I want to be next to you.

920
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:30,320
I'll stay here.
- You're can't be here, Veera.

921
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:32,760
Go to your room and sleep.

922
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:34,880
I am getting nightmares,
Ms. Meenakshi.

923
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:36,640
Veera! Veera!

924
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:39,240
I will be with you only.

925
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:41,520
Veera! Don't scream.
- Hold me, Ms. Meenakshi

926
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:43,000
I am getting scared.
- Okay.

927
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:44,840
Okay.
- I am getting scared.

928
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:46,560
Okay.
- I am getting scared.

929
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:47,520
Nothing has happened.

930
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:50,120
I am getting scared.
- Okay.

931
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:52,000
Veera!

932
01:17:52,120 --> 01:17:53,920
Veera, what?
- Ms. Meenakshi!

933
01:17:54,280 --> 01:17:56,760
Ms. Meenakshi!

934
01:17:56,840 --> 01:17:58,640
I will sleep next to you,
Ms. Meenakshi.

935
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:01,560
Only then can I sleep.
- Veera!

936
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:04,000
Ms. Meenakshi..
- Sleep, Veera.

937
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:06,880
Sleep.
- I'm scared. Hold me.

938
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,520
Sleep. Sleep.
- I will be with you.

939
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:13,360
Okay. Okay, it's nothing.
- I'm having nightmares.

940
01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:16,480
Okay. Okay.
- I am getting nightmares.

941
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:17,840
Sleep.

942
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:22,160
I will be here only.

943
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:23,520
Okay,
- I won't go anywhere.

944
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:24,920
Okay..

945
01:18:25,680 --> 01:18:26,760
Please.

946
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:31,920
Sleep, Veera.

947
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:34,600
Sleep.

948
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:42,200
She was with me for two years.

949
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:45,640
Veera!
- Yes?

950
01:18:54,040 --> 01:18:54,960
I am going to get married.

951
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:58,280
He's a friend of mine.
His name is Krishna.

952
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:04,720
I've known him for a long time.
He's been asking me for a while.

953
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:09,360
He is on his way here.

954
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:11,640
I want you to meet him.

955
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:23,440
Hi! Meenakshi?
Where is Meenakshi?

956
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:26,480
She is inside.
- Oh, call her.

957
01:19:27,320 --> 01:19:29,000
I'm extremely glad to meet
you, Veera.

958
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:30,960
Veera or Samar?

959
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:31,920
Veera.

960
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:34,560
Nice to meet you, Veera.
- Same here, sir.

961
01:19:35,960 --> 01:19:37,480
What's the plan, Meenakshi?
- Shall we go out?

962
01:19:37,960 --> 01:19:40,080
It happened so suddenly.
- They told me at 12..

963
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:41,920
Is that all?
Will a signature suffice?

964
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:44,080
Veera!

965
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:46,720
Okay. Here you go.

966
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:50,240
Congratulations.

967
01:19:53,560 --> 01:19:55,360
You should congratulate me.

968
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:57,320
We're finally married.

969
01:19:57,400 --> 01:19:58,960
Congratulations!

970
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:01,720
Won't you congratulate
Ms. Meenakshi?

971
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:03,520
Congratulations!
- Thank you very much.

972
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:05,760
He is very shy.

973
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:11,200
This would have never happened

974
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:12,560
if we hadn't met at
the bank that day, right? - Yes.

975
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:15,600
I think so.
- I pursued you for four years.

976
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:17,640
when we were in college.

977
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:19,920
All you said was 'no'.

978
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:23,800
But three months ago,
after all these years

979
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,120
I asked you again.

980
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:27,680
And you said 'okay'.
I just can't figure you out.

981
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:31,520
I never liked you during
the four years in college

982
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:34,280
But..

983
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:38,760
What?
- When I met you

984
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:41,360
after 13 years, I liked you.

985
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:43,560
I think it's because of this.

986
01:20:48,240 --> 01:20:50,000
What happened? What happened?

987
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:53,080
Veera!

988
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:57,640
What are you doing?
- Move away!

989
01:21:01,680 --> 01:21:03,880
He needs to die!
I'm the only one for you!

990
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:07,200
Who is he to be here?
Let me kill him!

991
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:16,880
Meenakshi, call the police.

992
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:19,040
Call the police now. Meenakshi!

993
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:22,760
Meenakshi!
- Ms. Meenakshi! Ms. Meenakshi!

994
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:25,840
Leave him, Ms. Meenakshi!

995
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:28,680
Ms. Meenakshi!

996
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:31,880
Ms. Meenakshi..

997
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:33,920
Ms. Meenakshi! I am there for you.

998
01:21:35,080 --> 01:21:36,520
Ms. Meenakshi! I am there.

999
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:38,040
We'll go live somewhere else.

1000
01:21:38,120 --> 01:21:40,320
We don't need him.
I love you, Ms. Meenakshi!

1001
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:42,520
I love you, Ms. Meenakshi!
I love you.

1002
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:45,000
Hereafter, I will be all you need.
We don't need him.

1003
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:46,840
I'll be there for you.

1004
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:49,240
Hey!
- I am there for you.

1005
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:51,680
Listen. I will take care of you.

1006
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,760
Why did you bring him into
our lives, Ms. Meenakshi?

1007
01:21:55,080 --> 01:21:58,520
I'm everything to you.
Let's go live somewhere else

1008
01:21:58,640 --> 01:22:00,800
Why do you need him
when I'm around?

1009
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:13,160
This is not a marriage.
We don't need this.

1010
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:15,320
Meena..
- I don't like it!

1011
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:24,160
Meenakshi! Help me!

1012
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:32,760
Veera! No.

1013
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:39,720
No. No.

1014
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:43,600
Ms. Meenakshi!

1015
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:45,960
Ms. Meenakshi!

1016
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:48,360
Oh, no!
Nothing will happen to you!

1017
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:51,880
Ms. Meenakshi!

1018
01:22:57,560 --> 01:22:59,880
Help..

1019
01:23:59,880 --> 01:24:00,960
No..

1020
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:07,640
It took her three months
to finally open her eyes.

1021
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:10,240
Surgery for five months.

1022
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:14,320
I'm her lawyer, I need to see her.
- Eight months of hospitalisation.

1023
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:17,040
Ma'am?

1024
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:19,720
Ma'am?

1025
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:24,760
Sir!

1026
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:27,680
There should be no
charges against the boy.

1027
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:29,720
Okay.
- No accusations either.

1028
01:24:30,360 --> 01:24:31,720
Take care of it.
- All right.

1029
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:33,040
Take care of it.

1030
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:35,640
Do you understand, sir?
- I..

1031
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:37,880
Please!

1032
01:24:37,960 --> 01:24:40,080
All right.
- If he is arrested

1033
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:41,600
it will become a huge problem.

1034
01:24:42,440 --> 01:24:44,600
There should be no
charges against him.

1035
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:46,360
Okay.
- He didn't do anything.

1036
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:47,840
Okay?
- I'll take care of it.

1037
01:24:48,240 --> 01:24:50,800
My husband was not a good guy.

1038
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:54,000
He hit me. He wounded me.

1039
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:57,360
He abused me that night.

1040
01:24:57,720 --> 01:24:59,600
It was he who caused the fire

1041
01:25:00,040 --> 01:25:01,920
He tortured me using a candle.

1042
01:25:02,360 --> 01:25:03,720
The entire room caught fire.

1043
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:05,440
He was the one who
caused my burns as well

1044
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:07,600
Got it?
- I will take care.

1045
01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:10,280
I want you to help me.
- Okay.

1046
01:25:10,760 --> 01:25:13,320
Did you get any news about Veera?
- No.

1047
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:14,880
He was the one who saved me.

1048
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:16,840
He brought me out of there.

1049
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:21,360
Find him and bring him to me.
- Go and talk to her.

1050
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:35,040
Sorry, Ms. Meenakshi!

1051
01:25:35,160 --> 01:25:36,760
I-I am sorry.

1052
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:38,520
What are you doing?

1053
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:41,800
Ms. Meenakshi!
- Okay, enough. Come

1054
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:42,920
You are making a scene.

1055
01:25:45,240 --> 01:25:48,040
Come. - Ms. Meenakshi!
Come! - Ms. Meenakshi!

1056
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:51,520
I will take complete care of you.

1057
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:53,240
I will take care of you.

1058
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:58,040
I'll take care of everything.
Keep me with you.

1059
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:01,440
I'll be there for you.

1060
01:26:02,160 --> 01:26:04,400
I am not angry with you.

1061
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:06,680
Only him.

1062
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:08,640
He is not a good guy.

1063
01:26:09,320 --> 01:26:10,680
That's why, I did it.

1064
01:26:13,680 --> 01:26:17,280
Sorry..

1065
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:21,800
Veera!

1066
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:26,840
Come. Come and sit next to me.

1067
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:36,320
Look at me.

1068
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:45,600
What will I do?

1069
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:48,040
How will I step out?

1070
01:26:49,560 --> 01:26:50,760
I am bald.

1071
01:26:51,480 --> 01:26:52,440
I have nothing.

1072
01:26:54,440 --> 01:26:56,880
The lawyer and I spoke
to the doctor.

1073
01:26:59,200 --> 01:27:01,640
Reconstructive surgery.

1074
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:06,080
Then, skin grafting.

1075
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:09,680
They will take another's
skin and match it with yours.

1076
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:12,280
You will be beautiful again.

1077
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:13,800
You will even get your hair back.

1078
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:21,280
You will get dresses in
a particular material.

1079
01:27:22,280 --> 01:27:24,480
You will be comfortable in them.

1080
01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:27,560
That's just for a couple of years.

1081
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:31,280
Then, you'll be fine.

1082
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:34,480
I'll be there to take care of you.

1083
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:38,720
We will move to Madras.

1084
01:27:39,400 --> 01:27:40,720
Isn't that what you wanted?

1085
01:27:42,120 --> 01:27:43,840
I'll take care of it.

1086
01:27:45,880 --> 01:27:49,840
Get my house in Chennai
ready for us to move in.

1087
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:52,600
I..

1088
01:27:54,040 --> 01:27:55,720
I want to go there.

1089
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:58,640
I will go there with Veera.

1090
01:27:59,320 --> 01:28:02,600
The doctor said that I will be
discharged in three months.

1091
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:06,560
I don't want to stay in Bombay.

1092
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:11,920
I want the documents to..

1093
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:14,280
Transfer all my assets to him.

1094
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:20,160
Power of attorney, legal guardian..

1095
01:28:20,840 --> 01:28:22,680
Take care of everything.

1096
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:24,840
Take him with you.

1097
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:27,320
Show him around.
- Okay.

1098
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:28,800
Please take care of him.

1099
01:28:30,040 --> 01:28:31,720
Get his TC from his school here.

1100
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:33,680
Get him an admission in Chennai.
- Okay.

1101
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:45,440
Six months later

1102
01:28:45,640 --> 01:28:48,120
she passed away in the hospital.

1103
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:52,760
Did you ask for an ambulance?
- Yes, sir.

1104
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:55,520
Why do you want to take her to
Madras when everything is over?

1105
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:57,520
Please don't treat me like a kid,
Sir.

1106
01:28:58,240 --> 01:29:00,120
She wanted to go to Madras.

1107
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:02,480
I want to take her there.

1108
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:06,000
You've made arrangements at
the house there, haven't you?

1109
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:09,320
I have the address. I can go.

1110
01:29:10,360 --> 01:29:12,560
I'll.. I'll take
care of her there.

1111
01:29:12,640 --> 01:29:15,400
I came to Chennai in
the ambulance with her

1112
01:29:15,680 --> 01:29:17,320
five years ago.

1113
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:31,880
Let's wait awhile.

1114
01:29:32,240 --> 01:29:34,560
No, let's leave.

1115
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:36,480
We'll leave immediately.

1116
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:40,840
He's mad. He seems to talk
to himself. - Bring her out.

1117
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:52,760
Hey. Why do you keep
saying that she is dead?

1118
01:29:53,200 --> 01:29:55,040
She couldn't have shot you

1119
01:29:55,240 --> 01:29:56,520
if she was really dead.

1120
01:29:58,160 --> 01:29:59,280
She was the one who shot you.

1121
01:30:01,160 --> 01:30:02,160
She didn't die.

1122
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:05,720
She is going to die.

1123
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:08,400
Ms. Meenakshi..

1124
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:09,560
Go inside.

1125
01:30:11,680 --> 01:30:13,240
There's a big backyard too!

1126
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:19,680
We can have a lot of dogs here.

1127
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:24,160
What a huge tree!

1128
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:30,640
Go inside.

1129
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:33,320
Isn't it nice?

1130
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:38,560
Ms. Meenakshi!
There is a room downstairs for you.

1131
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:41,520
There is a room upstairs for me.

1132
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:48,880
Is it nice?

1133
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:51,920
Did you like? it's your room.

1134
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:05,120
Ms. Meenakshi.

1135
01:31:06,120 --> 01:31:07,840
Are you okay?

1136
01:31:15,080 --> 01:31:16,280
Don't!

1137
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:37,720
Please eat.

1138
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:40,880
You need to eat well.

1139
01:31:44,720 --> 01:31:46,920
I went to school after
coming to Chennai.

1140
01:31:47,880 --> 01:31:49,000
Sukanya?

1141
01:31:49,200 --> 01:31:51,840
I saw her for the first
time in school.

1142
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:53,240
She was my classmate.

1143
01:31:53,560 --> 01:31:54,800
She studied with me.

1144
01:31:56,680 --> 01:31:59,320
It was just for a year.
I didn't go to school after that.

1145
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:02,640
I didn't like it.
I preferred to stay at home.

1146
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,640
We didn't allow anyone
inside our house.

1147
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:08,720
The two of us took care
of everything.

1148
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:09,600
Ms. Meenakshi!

1149
01:32:12,440 --> 01:32:14,520
She did all the household work.

1150
01:32:22,640 --> 01:32:24,880
Ms. Meenakshi! Did you see this?

1151
01:32:25,880 --> 01:32:26,880
Isn't it nice?

1152
01:32:29,480 --> 01:32:30,840
I got it done myself.

1153
01:32:39,480 --> 01:32:41,080
After the dawn of the internet

1154
01:32:41,200 --> 01:32:44,640
You could do anything with ease.

1155
01:32:44,920 --> 01:32:46,800
In today's world, the internet

1156
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:48,400
is the easiest way
to pick up girls.

1157
01:32:48,680 --> 01:32:51,680
No matter how intelligent
the girl is

1158
01:32:51,960 --> 01:32:53,440
she will fall prey

1159
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:56,520
to a bunch of lies uttered
over the internet.

1160
01:32:57,880 --> 01:33:00,160
Their parents buy them computers.

1161
01:33:00,280 --> 01:33:01,800
Fast internet connection.

1162
01:33:02,120 --> 01:33:05,160
They stay up the
whole night chatting.

1163
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:08,720
Parents sleep under the impression
that their daughter is studying.

1164
01:33:09,880 --> 01:33:12,120
And that is how
Sandhya fell prey to me.

1165
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:19,360
After that, I became her prey.

1166
01:33:19,680 --> 01:33:21,440
Veera?
- Yes.

1167
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:23,080
Oh!
- Sandhya.

1168
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:24,480
Hi!
- Hi!

1169
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:33,680
She was simply beautiful.

1170
01:33:34,360 --> 01:33:35,160
An Angel.

1171
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:42,800
Good to see you finally!

1172
01:33:44,280 --> 01:33:46,120
Good to see you actually.

1173
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:48,720
Her smile was like
like flowing honey.

1174
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:51,600
I've never seen honey flow.

1175
01:33:52,120 --> 01:33:53,200
It's a Tamil idiom I've heard.

1176
01:33:53,720 --> 01:33:55,080
I'm just using that
idiom as a reference.

1177
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:57,720
We went out a lot.

1178
01:34:00,680 --> 01:34:01,480
Wow!

1179
01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:05,240
You live here?
- Yes. This is my house.

1180
01:34:05,320 --> 01:34:07,000
All I do is chat online.

1181
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:10,120
My only friends are
three people from college.

1182
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:14,040
But they don't know
that I'm here.

1183
01:34:14,200 --> 01:34:15,760
On the way..

1184
01:34:16,160 --> 01:34:18,560
They always find fault with me.

1185
01:34:22,320 --> 01:34:24,400
Are you okay?
- Yes. I am okay.

1186
01:34:25,320 --> 01:34:26,960
My aunt is downstairs.

1187
01:34:27,400 --> 01:34:28,440
Your Aunt?

1188
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:31,080
I'll just check if she's asleep.
Please have a seat.

1189
01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:32,560
Who is she?

1190
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:34,240
I wanted to tell you..

1191
01:34:34,760 --> 01:34:36,600
I decided to show her to you.

1192
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:39,880
I like her and she likes me too.

1193
01:34:41,240 --> 01:34:42,840
I want to stay with her.

1194
01:34:43,120 --> 01:34:45,760
You are just 17 years old.
What's the hurry?

1195
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:48,360
I want her. This is love.

1196
01:34:49,120 --> 01:34:51,000
I didn't mingle with her
with any wrong intentions.

1197
01:34:51,360 --> 01:34:52,600
Neither did she.

1198
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:57,520
We've known each other for two
months. This will surely click.

1199
01:34:57,960 --> 01:35:00,280
For me and for us.

1200
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:01,800
I think so.

1201
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,600
Come and see her. Come.

1202
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:10,480
I will see her later.

1203
01:35:10,680 --> 01:35:12,080
Ms. Meenakshi! Please!

1204
01:35:14,760 --> 01:35:17,600
My friends will be so jealous.

1205
01:35:17,800 --> 01:35:19,360
If I tell them that my
boyfriend is a techie from IIT.

1206
01:35:19,640 --> 01:35:21,600
I will call you Veerae.

1207
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:24,160
You'll have to respond
when I call you Veerae.

1208
01:35:24,560 --> 01:35:26,080
You can call it love.

1209
01:35:26,440 --> 01:35:27,800
If I say 'Veerae'

1210
01:35:27,960 --> 01:35:29,760
you'll have to stop whatever
it is you're doing and respond.

1211
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:32,480
I will come on
Saturdays and Sundays.

1212
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:35,480
We'll go out.
You should take me out.

1213
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:39,320
Say 'Sandhya'. Veera..

1214
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:44,560
What?

1215
01:35:46,360 --> 01:35:48,640
Stop or I'll just stay here.

1216
01:35:49,200 --> 01:35:50,760
I really like your house.

1217
01:35:51,560 --> 01:35:52,600
Actually, I am happy.

1218
01:35:55,560 --> 01:35:57,120
Come here.

1219
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:05,840
She killed her.

1220
01:36:14,200 --> 01:36:15,240
Meenakshi!

1221
01:36:15,400 --> 01:36:17,080
That was revenge.

1222
01:36:17,680 --> 01:36:20,040
An eye for an eye.

1223
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:30,800
Veera!

1224
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,240
Take care of her.

1225
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:40,800
If you decide to save her life

1226
01:36:41,240 --> 01:36:42,640
you'll have to answer
many questions.

1227
01:36:43,320 --> 01:36:44,480
It will be better if she dies.

1228
01:36:45,880 --> 01:36:48,480
Nobody should ever see her again.

1229
01:36:52,240 --> 01:36:53,680
Veera!

1230
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:56,400
Veera!

1231
01:36:57,760 --> 01:36:59,040
Veera!

1232
01:36:59,640 --> 01:37:00,640
What did I do?

1233
01:37:35,480 --> 01:37:37,800
Stop.. Stop here.
- Okay.

1234
01:37:38,360 --> 01:37:43,440
It's midnight. You'll have to pay
Rs. 150. - Oh, God!

1235
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:47,160
I can only pay you Rs.100.
Please leave.

1236
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:49,680
Hello?
Why aren't you answering my call?

1237
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:51,320
I know I'm late.

1238
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:53,040
Come and open the gate.
Fast!

1239
01:37:53,160 --> 01:37:55,000
Please! Idiot!

1240
01:38:26,120 --> 01:38:27,200
Who are you?

1241
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:29,320
If I were to come up to
you on the street and say

1242
01:38:29,400 --> 01:38:31,480
'My name is Veera.
I'm a really nice guy'

1243
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:34,200
'I want to talk to you.
I'd like to know you.'

1244
01:38:34,280 --> 01:38:35,200
would you have spoken to me?

1245
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:38,560
No. Hence, I kidnapped you.
- What?

1246
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:42,400
I've been searching for the
past three months.

1247
01:38:42,760 --> 01:38:45,200
I'm unable to stay here by myself.

1248
01:38:45,360 --> 01:38:46,200
I was going mad.

1249
01:38:46,680 --> 01:38:47,920
I want sex also.

1250
01:38:48,200 --> 01:38:50,680
Disgusting.
- I have you now.

1251
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:52,960
I'll say it now.
My name is Veera.

1252
01:38:53,080 --> 01:38:54,200
I am a good guy.

1253
01:38:54,560 --> 01:38:57,320
Talk to me. Get to know me.

1254
01:38:57,480 --> 01:39:00,280
This is my house. I will take
care of you like a princess.

1255
01:39:01,080 --> 01:39:03,200
Would you have spoken to me
if I'd said those things?

1256
01:39:04,160 --> 01:39:04,960
You wouldn't, would you?

1257
01:39:13,800 --> 01:39:14,680
Ms. Meenakshi?

1258
01:39:15,800 --> 01:39:16,600
Ms. Meenakshi?

1259
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:19,280
Ms. Meenakshi?

1260
01:39:20,160 --> 01:39:20,960
Ms. Meenakshi..

1261
01:39:25,120 --> 01:39:26,280
Ms. Meenakshi?

1262
01:39:30,640 --> 01:39:32,520
Ms. Meenakshi!

1263
01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:35,920
Ms. Meenakshi!
Open the door!

1264
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:37,400
Please! Ms. Meenakshi!

1265
01:39:38,280 --> 01:39:41,600
No, please! Ms. Meenakshi!

1266
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:45,080
Ms. Meenakshi!

1267
01:39:46,600 --> 01:39:48,760
Don't! Please!

1268
01:39:50,280 --> 01:39:51,640
Don't..

1269
01:39:58,440 --> 01:40:00,440
Ms. Meenakshi..

1270
01:40:01,680 --> 01:40:03,760
Open the door!
Open..

1271
01:40:08,640 --> 01:40:11,160
No! No!

1272
01:40:16,240 --> 01:40:18,120
No. No.

1273
01:40:18,680 --> 01:40:22,360
No.. Please!

1274
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:23,760
No.

1275
01:40:24,320 --> 01:40:26,560
No.

1276
01:40:27,800 --> 01:40:30,280
No! Ms. Meenakshi!

1277
01:40:33,400 --> 01:40:34,840
Why, Ms. Meenakshi?

1278
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,080
Please! Please!

1279
01:40:40,120 --> 01:40:42,440
Ms. Meenakshi!

1280
01:40:43,960 --> 01:40:46,040
Be careful with her hair.

1281
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:47,680
Don't get blood on it.

1282
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:50,080
I need her hair.

1283
01:41:20,520 --> 01:41:21,800
Two girls that year.

1284
01:41:22,760 --> 01:41:24,360
I turned 18 the next year.

1285
01:41:26,480 --> 01:41:27,640
One girl.

1286
01:41:29,320 --> 01:41:31,760
One girl when I turned 19.

1287
01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:33,760
Or maybe it was three.

1288
01:41:37,120 --> 01:41:39,280
One fine day, five years

1289
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:42,200
after my schooling

1290
01:41:42,600 --> 01:41:44,040
I saw Sukanya.

1291
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,080
She was not like the other girls.

1292
01:41:47,680 --> 01:41:49,120
This is another type of love.

1293
01:41:49,880 --> 01:41:53,360
Love at first sight, both
when I was in school and now.

1294
01:41:53,680 --> 01:41:55,400
I thought there won't be trouble.

1295
01:41:55,480 --> 01:41:57,000
We went to school together.

1296
01:41:57,360 --> 01:42:01,400
Sukanya? I saw her in
school for the first time.

1297
01:42:01,480 --> 01:42:03,040
She's my classmate.

1298
01:42:03,120 --> 01:42:05,120
She studied with me.

1299
01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:09,400
What else?
- That's all.

1300
01:42:16,360 --> 01:42:19,040
Doctor, this is a very different
type of a case.

1301
01:42:19,160 --> 01:42:22,120
It is very peculiar. Do
you come across such cases often?

1302
01:42:22,200 --> 01:42:25,080
You see, first of all, we shouldn't
think that everyone who

1303
01:42:25,160 --> 01:42:29,000
is mentally ill will
be ruthless and murderers.

1304
01:42:29,240 --> 01:42:31,520
Most of them are extremely silent.

1305
01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:32,920
They are very docile.

1306
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:34,920
But there are a few others

1307
01:42:35,120 --> 01:42:36,320
who, because of certain incidents

1308
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:39,360
and due to past experiences
in their life

1309
01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:41,200
get mentally disturbed.

1310
01:42:41,360 --> 01:42:43,080
They might face a lot of trouble.

1311
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:46,080
There is a young lady.

1312
01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:49,240
She is an
intelligent, smart, young girl.

1313
01:42:49,680 --> 01:42:52,760
She was molested in her childhood.

1314
01:42:52,840 --> 01:42:53,960
It was sexual abuse.

1315
01:42:54,280 --> 01:42:56,560
Her only support
were her grandparents.

1316
01:42:57,040 --> 01:43:00,880
She was extremely shocked
when they passed away.

1317
01:43:01,600 --> 01:43:04,760
At that point in her life, a bunch
of guys

1318
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:07,520
kidnapped her and tried
to rape her.

1319
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:09,840
When police went in search
of her the next morning

1320
01:43:09,920 --> 01:43:13,480
she was found sitting with
their corpses around her.

1321
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:15,720
No one knows what happened.

1322
01:43:16,360 --> 01:43:18,560
She has been admitted
in our hospital.

1323
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:20,440
She is mentally disturbed.

1324
01:43:20,640 --> 01:43:22,560
She is under treatment.

1325
01:43:24,720 --> 01:43:26,240
In Veera's case

1326
01:43:26,320 --> 01:43:28,760
The sexual abuse
he faced when he was a child

1327
01:43:29,040 --> 01:43:31,440
was the root cause of
his mental illness.

1328
01:43:31,880 --> 01:43:33,040
But

1329
01:43:33,280 --> 01:43:36,000
not everybody who has
been sexually abused

1330
01:43:36,080 --> 01:43:37,720
becomes mentally ill.

1331
01:43:39,160 --> 01:43:40,840
Criminals can be put in jail.

1332
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:42,760
But people who are mentally ill,
need treatment.

1333
01:43:43,200 --> 01:43:46,520
Instead of
treating them as criminals

1334
01:43:46,600 --> 01:43:48,520
they should be treated
as mentally ill.

1335
01:43:48,680 --> 01:43:51,560
The person in front of you

1336
01:43:51,640 --> 01:43:53,760
was sexually abused as a child
and this affected him mentally.

1337
01:43:54,160 --> 01:43:57,120
Now he is a criminal.
His name is Veera.

1338
01:43:58,280 --> 01:44:00,880
If Veera had gone through
counselling earlier

1339
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:03,680
if he had been brought
up in a healthy environment

1340
01:44:03,880 --> 01:44:05,960
he would have been a good citizen.

1341
01:44:06,240 --> 01:44:08,600
What he went through

1342
01:44:08,680 --> 01:44:11,200
was kept hidden and all
the feelings were bottled.

1343
01:44:11,360 --> 01:44:13,240
All of it remained inside him.

1344
01:44:13,440 --> 01:44:16,880
All these factors contributed
to his current mental state.

1345
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:19,760
In Veera's case

1346
01:44:19,880 --> 01:44:22,640
he strongly believes that he
didn't commit these murders.

1347
01:44:22,720 --> 01:44:24,320
He believes that Meenakshi did it.

1348
01:44:24,760 --> 01:44:27,240
Although Meenakshi is dead

1349
01:44:27,360 --> 01:44:28,680
he still believes

1350
01:44:28,760 --> 01:44:30,400
that she is alive.

1351
01:44:30,880 --> 01:44:33,800
He believes that she is
controlling him in many ways.

1352
01:44:34,040 --> 01:44:36,520
Mentally ill people

1353
01:44:36,600 --> 01:44:38,400
go through many experiences

1354
01:44:38,560 --> 01:44:41,440
where they hear voices
that nobody else can hear.

1355
01:44:41,520 --> 01:44:44,120
They see things that nobody
else does

1356
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:46,960
They actually see them.

1357
01:44:47,160 --> 01:44:49,680
They can see it.
They can hear it.

1358
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:52,280
They don't do
these things consciously.

1359
01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:54,440
They strongly believe

1360
01:44:54,520 --> 01:44:56,520
that somebody forces
them to do these things.

1361
01:44:56,800 --> 01:44:57,600
In the same way

1362
01:44:57,680 --> 01:45:00,800
Veera has three personalities
inside him, namely

1363
01:45:00,880 --> 01:45:03,440
Veera, Samar and Meenakshi.

1364
01:45:03,760 --> 01:45:05,240
But all of them are Veera.

1365
01:45:05,320 --> 01:45:06,960
At certain point of time

1366
01:45:07,040 --> 01:45:09,280
Veera would become
Samar or Meenakshi.

1367
01:45:10,520 --> 01:45:11,720
So, Mr. Vijay

1368
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:13,320
I have bifurcated a human mind

1369
01:45:13,480 --> 01:45:15,560
how it works,
and what the issues are

1370
01:45:15,640 --> 01:45:17,520
and showed it to you.

1371
01:45:17,880 --> 01:45:20,040
There have been many
reasons for it.

1372
01:45:20,120 --> 01:45:21,800
There have been many
bad consequences as well.

1373
01:45:22,080 --> 01:45:25,720
This were our preliminary
findings.

1374
01:45:26,160 --> 01:45:28,680
As I spoke to Veera

1375
01:45:28,760 --> 01:45:32,280
I found more shocking facts.
