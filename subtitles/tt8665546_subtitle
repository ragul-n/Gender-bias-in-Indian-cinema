00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:00,520
Welcome People, to the exciting

..which is a rare event.
The excitement is very obvious.

3
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,110
We have a beautiful day
today clear sky..

4
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:12,330
..and every one is excited, there is a
head go to the trucks and they are on..

5

The race is getting intense now.

8
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:25,890
I don't know who is ahead
and who is lagging behind.

9
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:28,430
May the best racer wins.

10
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:35,020
It's getting pretty dusty right now..

11
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,880
..I thought it was a clear day.

12
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,210
Well it's amazing that you
show such excitement for everyone..

13
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:50,770
..because you don't
know who is in which truck..

14
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:52,250
..that's a real good sportsmanship.

15
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:53,350
Oh, Yes!

16
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,450
Hey people Cheers!

17
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,780
I think the race is
getting a lot intense now..

18
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:04,510
..because some trucks are leading
and we don't know who is leading yet.

19
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:13,050
Well this space is creating
a lot more drama as nobody knows..

20
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:14,970
..who is in which truck.

21
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:22,120
All right the prayers are on..
let's see who wins..

22
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,910
..everyone is pretty
determined though.

23
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,500
O what do I see..

24
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:31,380
- Oh god no , do I see a tornado.
- Yes!

25
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:37,140
Wow! A tornado is approaching..

26
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:44,690
What bad timing , I hope they
can see it , that really worries me .

27
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,580
Oh my god,
what if the truck is turning..

28
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:52,180
..I think it's getting
trapped in the tornado.. No..

29
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,100
..that really worries me..

30
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:02,310
..it's going round in circles,
oh no rest of them too.

31
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,840
The trucks are trapped in the tornado,
and they are just circling around the flag.

32
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,840
I hope they don't
bump into each other.

33
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:17,730
Oh no!

34
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:19,800
Oh no gosh!

35
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:24,780
All the trucks are completely trapped in
the tornado, and they are circling around.

36
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,920
I don't know what to say..

37
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,780
..they don't Gona make it..

38
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,740
I hope they make it.

39
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:47,390
What is him just gets out..

40
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:51,080
..he walked from that,
he came out of it..

41
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,960
..rest of them are
going into directions.

42
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,270
I don't know but
who is in that truck..

43
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:03,160
..god knows,
looks like a miracle to me..

44
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,120
..may be it was meant to win.

45
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:12,180
Bravo! Well done, what if
that makes it to the finish line.

46
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,500
Let's wait and watch who is in it..

00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:21,900

00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:48,140
..so even tornado could not stop him.

51
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:31,500
"I had small piece of land,
did whatever I can."

52
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:34,250

"Then spread across the world.."

72
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,180
"Many settled in Canada."

73
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:06,540

"Beloved is far away..

92
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:32,910
"Yet the letter writing continues."

93
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:38,420
"Lit a lamp of love..

94
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:44,100
"Beloved is far away..

00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:26,190
"I like to play on the road with."

108
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:53,860
"Like a beautiful girl
leaves the house all decked up."

109
00:12:53,940 --> 00:13:01,990
"I decked up its meter belt
by sticking chrome everywhere."

110
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:07,760
"Like a beautiful girl

"Kim Kardashian's
heart skips a beat.."

114
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:21,420
"Kim Kardashian's
heart skips a beat.."

115
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,540
"When it speeds up."

116
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:27,340
"I've got a 36-tyred truck."

117
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:30,100
"I like to play on the road with."

118
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,940
"Like a white boy on a beach.."

119
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,820
"Like a white boy on a beach.."

120
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:41,270
"Like a white boy on a beach
plays with his girlfriend's tresses."

121
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:44,010
"I've got a 36-tyred truck."

122
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:46,820
"I like to play on the road with."

123
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,610
"I've got a 36-tyred truck."

124
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:53,080
"I like to play on the road with."

125
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,490
Stay there. Let me check first.

126
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,990
It's all clear. Come on.

127
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,520
You are safe here.

128
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:10,100
This apartment has just one key,
which is with me.

129
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,340
Don't open the door for anyone.

130
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:15,420
I repeat,
you don't need to leave this place.

131
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:20,200
I'll be back tomorrow.
Don't open the door for anyone.

132
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:22,700
You don't need to worry.

133
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:26,540
He who'll try to mess
with Simmi needs to worry.

134
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:30,660
Because Simmi hits where it hurts.

135
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,980
You know,
the people involved in this murder..

136
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,300
..are very powerful and strong people.

137
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:37,020
No doubt, only a Punjabi
girl can have the courage..

138
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,960
..to testify against them.

139
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,470
No phone calls, correct?

140
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:51,620
I'll have to answer.
It's my boyfriend.

141
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,020
No means no.

142
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:56,120
Turn it off.

143
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,440
- It's yours.
- Oh, f**k.

144
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,060
Okay, wait.

145
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:07,260
Till the time you don't testify,
you won't tell anyone where you are.

146
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,750
- Got it?
- Yes.

147
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,220
I am done. Now it's your turn.

148
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:31,590
Hi Dara, I'm good. How are you?

149
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,060
I cannot talk to you for long.

150
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,440
I'll be in Calgary tomorrow,
meet me there.

151
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,580
Okay? I'll call you later.

152
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,720
I love you too, sweetheart.
Goodbye now.

153
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,340
Okay?

154
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:16,760
- Hey, Maddy..
- What did you think?

155
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:20,980
Rascal! You don't know.
Simmi hits where it hurts.

156
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,620
Come, Baba.

157
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,300
Coming.

158
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:11,100
Shall we?

159
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:16,230
Look at her sing.

160
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:20,060
He asks too many questions.

161
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,390
What happened?

162
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:54,440
This isn't aroma of food,
it's a flower's fragrance.

163
00:18:56,610 --> 00:19:02,760
Buddy, your guess is sometimes right.

164
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:10,060
An angel in hiding?

165
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:13,860
You!

166
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:16,290
Who hits brakes like this?

167
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,830
Who made you a driver?

168
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,060
I did.

169
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,890
But who asked you to get in.

170
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:25,690
It's your perfume that
caused him to hit the brakes.

171
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:28,100
She is neither an
Indian nor a foreigner.

172
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:30,500
She lies and then complains.

173
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:33,080
Forget me and continue driving.

174
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:38,370
Okay. I'll drive after you get down.

175
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:42,100
- What?
- Didn't you hear him?

176
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,740
Baba asked you to get down. Get out.

177
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,590
- Get down.
- What's wrong?

178
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:47,990
- Get out.
- But..

179
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:48,990
Come on.

180
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,100
- Listen!
- Get out.

181
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:53,140
- Get down. Come on.
- Wait..

182
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,560
- Wait! Hold on.
- Come on.

183
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,580
I don't want to send you away, but go.

184
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,910
Go away. Go, go.

185
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,860
- Let's go.
- One second, one second.

186
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:05,700
- Stop! Please.
- Hey fragrant witch, move aside.

187
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:06,980
One second, please.

188
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:09,180
A bus's passenger
can't ride in a truck.

189
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:11,650
I need help.
Are you going to Calgary?

190
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:14,160
We might go to Pucho?
How does it concern you?

191
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:16,700
But this road goes to Calgary.

192
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,470
It doesn't go to Pucho.

193
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:20,750
The road doesn't go anywhere actually.

194
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:22,640
It's the vehicle which moves.

195
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,240
And it's moving after
dropping you off.

196
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,010
- Move aside.
- Please listen to me.

197
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:30,320
We won't help you.

198
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,780
And we won't listen
to your good or bad story.

199
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:37,720
Baba, my boss,
he is going to do something very good.

200
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,460
And I too am going
to do something very good.

201
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,500
Please listen to me.

202
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:48,220
Look, if boss likes your
story then we might help you.

203
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:51,220
But Baba's decision
will be the final decision.

204
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,300
Okay.

205
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:55,360
See, the thing is
that I am from Vancouver.

206
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,460
Born and brought up in Canada.

207
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,520
I'll explain it in short.

208
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,730
I am an independent girl.

209
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:03,720
And I have just one boyfriend.

210
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,270
He stays in Calgary.

211
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:08,190
My parents don't like him.

212
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:11,740
And they want me
to marry someone else.

213
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,530
That doesn't even happen
in Khair Balongi Dao anymore.

214
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,100
You still living in
the 14th century in Canada?

215
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:22,620
Do they still serve Pathiwale
Chole Bhature in Khair Balongi Dao?

216
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,630
They serve it here in Montreal.

217
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:28,220
Do they still play Lucky
Ram Lucky and Chandi's song?

218
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,470
They play it in Calgary.

219
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,930
Do you find anyone calling
BMW as BM-Double U there?

220
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,890
You can find them here.

221
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:42,930
All the things that doesn't
happen in Punjab happens here.

222
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:46,890
Tell me, if it isn't so.

223
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,090
Oh really? Fine.

224
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,300
Do one thing.

225
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:56,100
Sing Didar Sandhu's duet
songs with your boyfriend.

226
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,290
And get lost. Let us leave.

227
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:00,320
Aren't you a Punjabi?

228
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:05,530
Being a Punjabi, you won't
help a helpless Punjabi girl?

229
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:12,220
The thing is,
we can help the Punjabi kudi..

230
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:15,830
..but we cannot help
a Punjabi girl. Got it?

231
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:18,740
Billa?

232
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:22,310
Let her get in.

233
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,070
Okay, he listened to me. Come in.

234
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:28,000
Come. Get in.

235
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,420
- What are you waiting for?
- Really?

236
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,500
Get in.

237
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:31,610
Come this way.

238
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:33,250
- Get in.
- Thank you.

239
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:36,980
Come. Get it, dear. Come.

240
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,920
I haven't eaten
anything since morning.

241
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,950
I am so hungry.

242
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:02,060
Oh, I found something.

243
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,580
Don't you have anything else?

244
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,350
There's something in the trailer.

245
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:39,250
No! I'm pretty full.

246
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:41,030
Thank you so much.

247
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:43,850
You guys are very sweet.

248
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:45,820
To hell with sweet.

249
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,720
You ate food meant for two of us.

250
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:50,930
Look at her capacity.

251
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:56,520
You used to taunt me that
this pint can carry a gallon.

252
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:01,650
Look at her, this eye drop
sized girl can carry a gallon.

253
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:12,100
By the way, you could have refused to
help me after listening to my story.

254
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:14,430
But then you changed your mind.

255
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:17,220
- Why?
- Because of Mr. Neek Singh.

256
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,360
Something similar
had happened with him.

257
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,800
Who is Mr. Neek Singh?

258
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:30,490
Neek Singh used to live in the neighborhood
of Gujranwala Kangniwal, Punjab.

259
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:36,400
This was when Punjab wasn't
divided as Pakistani or Hindustani.

260
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:39,040
Punjab used to be just Punjab.

261
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,950
Here you go, aunt.

262
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:50,990
A shawl for you.

263
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,460
May Allah keep you happy, son.

264
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:56,240
Why did you have to get me a shawl?

265
00:24:57,030 --> 00:25:01,600
You anyway spend all that
you earn in a trip on the villagers.

266
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,140
You should save some for yourself.

267
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:06,880
I have nothing of my own.
This village is mine.

268
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,430
- Shout out aloud!
- Lord is greatest!

269
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:11,970
- Shout out aloud!
- Lord is greatest!

270
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:14,690
- Shout out aloud!
- Lord is greatest!

271
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:19,640
We won't leave anyone
of theirs alive here.

272
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:24,950
Uncle, everyone knows
yet you stay unaware.

273
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:28,150
They have been killing
our people over here.

274
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:30,870
How can we do nothing about this?

275
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:33,470
But they are all our people here.
There are no strangers here.

276
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:36,470
There is one from another religion
here. How can he be one of us?

277
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:39,840
Harneek, my boy! Harneek!

278
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,730
What is it, aunt?

279
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:44,400
Harneek, this is the wrath of Lord.

280
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,490
Bad times are here.

281
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:48,970
What happened? What is wrong?

282
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:51,940
People have become
enemy of their own people.

283
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:55,530
It's time to use your judgment
and not give in to rumors.

284
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:59,840
Uncle, don't misunderstand news
as rumors and befriend the enemies.

285
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:03,540
It is time to think
about only one thing.

286
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:06,540
They are killing our people.

287
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,840
So we too will kill their people.

288
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:12,720
Government has caused this division.
This chaos won't last for long.

289
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,460
Everything will settle
down on its own.

290
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:17,010
Nothing is going
to be right again, son.

291
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:21,210
For Almighty's sake,
please leave this place.

292
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:22,780
Leave?

293
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,070
Where do I go?

294
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,720
Blood for blood.

295
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,760
Go to your people.

296
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,120
- Shout out aloud!
- Lord is greatest!

297
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,160
This is my house, my village.

298
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,330
This is no longer your house.

299
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:40,220
These villagers are
no longer your friends.

300
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,620
- Shout out aloud!
- Lord is greatest!

301
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:45,190
- Shout out aloud!
- Lord is greatest!

302
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:48,100
My childhood has changed.

303
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:52,280
Which I spent on the shoulders
of Hamir and Khans alike?

304
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:56,760
I have helped Rashid and
Rafaq raise their children.

305
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,430
I should leave them?

306
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:01,030
Baba's hands have changed..

307
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:02,950
..which helped me grow up?

308
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:05,350
- Shout out aloud!
- Lord is greatest!

309
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:06,910
Shout out aloud!

310
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:08,760
Everything has changed.

311
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:14,090
The news on the radio
changed everything.

312
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:19,180
Those times and days have
become a thing of a past now.

313
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:24,100
Consider this as God's will and leave.

314
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:26,070
- Shout out aloud!
- Lord is greatest!

315
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:29,240
- Shout out aloud!
- Goodbye, aunt.

316
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,890
May God be with you.

317
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,540
- Shout out aloud!
- Lord is greatest!

318
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:35,790
- Shout out aloud!
- Lord is greatest!

319
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:38,140
- Shout out aloud!
- Lord is greatest!

320
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,620
- Shout out aloud!
- Lord is greatest!

321
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,960
- Shout out aloud!
- Lord is greatest!

322
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,300
- Shout out aloud!
- Lord is greatest!

323
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:47,620
- Shout out aloud!
- Lord is greatest!

324
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,180
- Shout out aloud!
- Lord is greatest!

325
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:52,530
- Shout out aloud!
- Lord is greatest!

326
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:55,010
- Shout out aloud!
- Lord is greatest!

327
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,200
- Shout out aloud!
- Lord is greatest!

328
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,110
Shout out aloud!

329
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,530
You old woman,
happy with what you have done?

330
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:03,070
You helped him flee?

331
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:30,860
- Who is it? Who is it?
- He's a Sikh.

332
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:32,780
- Come on. Let's go.
- He's a Sikh.

333
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,390
He's a Sikh.

334
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,360
Go after him!

335
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:38,860
Catch him. Come on. Hurry up.

336
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,280
Don't you dare!

337
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:03,400
Don't you dare take another step!

338
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:07,800
I swear on Lord..

339
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,310
..as long as I am alive..

340
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:18,730
..I'll the one who
even looks at my daughter.

341
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:23,880
Aunt, I swear upon my turban,
I am a Sikh.

342
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:27,660
Sikhs were born to help the helpless.

343
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:37,700
Those who kill in the name of religion
won't even get a place in hell.

344
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:41,080
Sikhs are killing
in the name of Waheguru..

345
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:44,610
..whereas Muslims
in the name of Allah.

346
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:47,210
Oh God!

347
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:51,820
Protect my daughter.

348
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,060
Mother?

349
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,610
Mother..

350
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:00,020
Mother! Mother!

351
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,860
If you want, I can drop you anywhere.

352
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,410
Where do you want to go?

353
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,150
I have no one left.

354
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:47,540
There has to be someone who will
support you in these troubled times.

355
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:53,210
There is a village close to Amritsar,
Pershera.

356
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:56,990
My parents got me betrothed there.

357
00:31:57,670 --> 00:32:00,300
Come on, I'll take you there.

358
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,120
Are you hungry?

359
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:02,840
Would you like to eat a Pinni?

360
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:29,400
'Mother asked me not to eat
anything offered by a stranger.'

361
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:04,510
Where have we reached?

362
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:11,460
We are crossing a mosque.

363
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:14,710
We are in East Punjab now.

364
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:18,260
We had crossed a Gurudwara.

365
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:21,210
It is now a part of west Punjab.

366
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:25,180
Punjab got divided into two.

367
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:30,500
Even the rivers will
get divided I guess.

368
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:34,630
Each will get around two.

369
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,060
Are you hungry?

370
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:40,520
Yes.

371
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,280
Don't throw them again.

372
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:46,340
Aunt Noora had made them
with a lot of affection.

373
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:06,240
Oh no, you are choking.

374
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:12,380
I'll stop near a well.
We can take a breather there.

375
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:35,220
I think sun is very strong here.

376
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,300
This well has dried up.

377
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:39,670
Stay in the truck.

378
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:44,580
Keep the windows
closed and doors locked.

379
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:48,020
I'll go find another source.

380
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,860
Where did she go?

381
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:21,490
Where did you go?

382
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,020
Stupid girl?

383
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:51,440
I asked you to stay in the truck.

384
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,340
Do you have a death wish?

385
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:56,340
Let's go.

386
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:26,220
"The winds get merrier."

387
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:31,130
"They worship the path you take."

388
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:36,500
"The winds get merrier."

389
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:42,070
"They worship the path you take."

390
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:50,270
"When a stranger.."

391
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:58,150
"When a stranger feels like family.."

392
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:05,300
"Journey ends quickly
if your company is good."

393
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:10,520
"Journey ends quickly
if your company is good."

394
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:16,470
"Journey ends quickly
if your company is good."

395
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:57,830
"Time heals the broken heart."

396
00:39:57,910 --> 00:40:02,820
"Then all the shyness disappears."

397
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,350
"All the shyness.."

398
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:08,020
"All the shyness.."

399
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:13,260
"Time heals the broken heart."

400
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:18,570
"Then all the shyness disappears."

401
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:27,740
"If someone dear gets upset.."

402
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:34,690
"If someone dear gets upset,
your heart skips a beat."

403
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:41,820
"Journey ends quickly
if your company is good."

404
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:47,050
"Journey ends quickly
if your company is good."

405
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:52,300
"Journey ends quickly
if your company is good."

406
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:18,640
"Lamps get lighten at the crossroads."

407
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,090
"Lamps get lighten.."

408
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:26,490
"Even the birds rejoice."

409
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:38,230
"When the right path is shown."

410
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:44,910
"When the right path is shown."

411
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:52,300
"Journey ends quickly
if your company is good."

412
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:57,490
"Journey ends quickly
if your company is good."

413
00:41:57,570 --> 00:42:03,010
"Journey ends quickly
if your company is good."

414
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:44,570
"Desires burst the bubbles of sorrow."

415
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:49,750
"You never know when you'll confess."

416
00:42:49,830 --> 00:42:52,310
"You'll confess.."

417
00:42:52,390 --> 00:42:54,880
"You'll confess.."

418
00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:00,220
"Desires burst the bubbles of sorrow."

419
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:05,550
"You never know when you'll confess."

420
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:14,700
"This crazy heart.."

421
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:21,790
"This crazy heart crosses all limits."

422
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:28,790
"Journey ends quickly
if your company is good."

423
00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:34,010
"Journey ends quickly
if your company is good."

424
00:43:34,090 --> 00:43:39,200
"Journey ends quickly
if your company is good."

425
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:44,510
"Journey ends quickly
if your company is good."

426
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:49,760
"Journey ends quickly
if your company is good."

427
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:54,930
"Journey ends quickly
if your company is good."

428
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:02,450
Stay awake!

429
00:44:02,530 --> 00:44:04,990
Stay awake!

430
00:44:05,070 --> 00:44:07,200
Where are we sitting?

431
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,880
We are in our village. Where else?

432
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:13,250
I know we are in our village.
I mean where does this fall now.

433
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:15,370
We are India, right uncle?

434
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:20,840
Chief, who owns a truck here?

435
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:29,570
He looks suspicious.

436
00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:31,540
- Who knows where they have come from?
- Stay there.

437
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:33,800
- Let's go and find out.
- There is a woman with him.

438
00:44:34,490 --> 00:44:37,020
Stay awake!

439
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:41,530
- Stay awake!
- What is your name, brother?

440
00:44:41,950 --> 00:44:45,800
My name is Harneek Singh.
I am from Kangniwal.

441
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:48,270
What is this woman?
What is her name?

442
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:51,490
Where does Ratan Singh live, brother?

443
00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:53,550
We asked you what her name is.

444
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:56,890
Her name is stupid.
Where does Ratan Singh live?

445
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:00,580
Brother, I think he
kidnapped her from there.

446
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:03,360
My name is Soni.

447
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,660
Okay we accept that your name is Soni.

448
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:08,110
But how would we know whether
you are from this side or that side.

449
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:13,190
She was betrothed into
Ratan Singh's family.

450
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,850
I need to drop her
there safe and sound.

451
00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:17,460
Show me his house.

452
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,320
- Let's go.
- Let's go, chief.

453
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:23,730
We will soon know the truth.

454
00:45:23,810 --> 00:45:25,510
- Let's go.
- Stay awake!

455
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:36,130
Who is it? I am coming.

456
00:45:36,490 --> 00:45:37,560
Who is it?

457
00:45:39,290 --> 00:45:42,190
Brother, someone from the
other side has come to meet you.

458
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:44,360
He was asking where you stay.

459
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:46,480
Yes? Who is it? Tell me.

460
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,650
We have been asking
the same questions.

461
00:45:48,730 --> 00:45:50,180
Calm down.

462
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:53,440
Calm down. Yes, that reminds
me the fire will cool down.

463
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,770
- Look after them.
- Let's go. Look after them.

464
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:59,290
- Who are they?
- I don't know.

465
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,360
Soni?

466
00:46:02,650 --> 00:46:05,360
Yes, it's Soni.

467
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,960
Oh God!

468
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:08,980
What happened?

469
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:12,610
They killed everyone,
those misguided souls.

470
00:46:12,690 --> 00:46:17,230
Mother was alone. She made
me leave the village with her.

471
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:20,920
But she couldn't escape them for long.

472
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:25,920
I met them by chance.

473
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,900
She knew where you stayed.

474
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:31,980
It was a blessing from God.

475
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:35,570
Take care of her, I'll get going.

476
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,660
Goodbye.

477
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:40,170
Wait, young man.

478
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:43,610
Who are you?

479
00:46:43,930 --> 00:46:45,850
I am Harneek Singh.

480
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,330
I am from Kangniwal.

481
00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:52,250
This partition left me homeless.

482
00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:56,160
I found her alive among
the dead bodies lying on the road.

483
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:59,000
Her mother died a painful death.

484
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:03,840
I had promised her that
I'll take her to a safe place.

485
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:08,530
I have fulfill my promised.
I am leaving her in your care.

486
00:47:08,610 --> 00:47:13,170
How would we know whether you
have sinned or kept her honor intact?

487
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:14,700
Ungrateful beings.

488
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,780
You should be praise this girl..

489
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:23,370
..to keep her honor intact
even in troubled times.

490
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:29,410
And she kept praying for her husband's
wellbeing even when in trouble.

491
00:47:29,490 --> 00:47:31,400
Well done, young man.

492
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:34,780
You did a good deed
by bringing her here.

493
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:37,110
Okay then, goodbye.

494
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:38,740
Goodbye.

495
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:43,000
Get her inside.

496
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,890
Come in, my dear.
Come, my brave child.

497
00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:47,190
Let's go.

498
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:57,120
Look girl,
there is no other way to say this.

499
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,730
We have been hearing
new stories every day..

500
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:02,230
..about what are doing
to the girls across the border.

501
00:48:02,310 --> 00:48:04,960
And a stranger brought you here.

502
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:11,050
Look at your state, how do
we believe that he didn't do anything.

503
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:16,650
For God's sake don't say that, mother.

504
00:48:17,110 --> 00:48:20,040
Only God can vouch for my intentions.

505
00:48:20,370 --> 00:48:24,390
You had chosen me
to be your son's bride.

506
00:48:25,550 --> 00:48:29,560
Look into my eyes and
you shall know the truth.

507
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:31,270
Look into her eyes!

508
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:33,070
I don't see anything
but filth in them.

509
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:39,540
Look girl, we don't care
about what lies in your eyes.

510
00:48:40,670 --> 00:48:43,480
Have some shame, Ratan Singh.

511
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:47,310
For God's sake,
think about others at least.

512
00:48:47,390 --> 00:48:52,440
I can see it in her eyes
that she is telling the truth.

513
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:57,940
I don't know understand what
shamelessness blinds all of you.

514
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:00,970
I can see everything,
it's you who can't see anything.

515
00:49:02,090 --> 00:49:04,020
He can see the truth.

516
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:06,080
Soni, my child.

517
00:49:06,890 --> 00:49:09,190
This is bad.

518
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:13,910
But you should stay strong.
I will talk to Panth.

519
00:49:14,570 --> 00:49:17,650
Aunt, I don't think
anything will work out.

520
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,300
Why do you worry?

521
00:49:21,390 --> 00:49:25,050
Your Panth is different
from all of them.

522
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:31,920
There, Panth is back.
I'll talk to him.

523
00:49:38,530 --> 00:49:40,650
Aunt, there is nothing to think about.

524
00:49:40,730 --> 00:49:46,420
I cannot marry a girl who has
spent a night with a truck driver.

525
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:50,460
Panth, he isn't that kind of a man.

526
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:54,650
If he were like that then
why would he bring her here?

527
00:49:54,990 --> 00:49:57,900
A woman can read into a man's eye.

528
00:49:57,980 --> 00:50:03,150
Aunt, you can never look
at someone and know how he is.

529
00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:04,430
There is just one thing I know.

530
00:50:04,510 --> 00:50:07,730
Come hell or high water,
I don't want her.

531
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:42,480
Where are you going, stupid?

532
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,350
How does it concern you?

533
00:51:44,690 --> 00:51:47,690
Didn't I leave you
with your fiance's family?

534
00:51:47,990 --> 00:51:50,740
Yes, but they are idiots.

535
00:51:51,330 --> 00:51:53,050
Great.

536
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:56,480
But can't they be given any sense?

537
00:51:57,150 --> 00:51:59,740
Suspicion doesn't let that happen.

538
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,750
It's very simple.

539
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:05,120
I cannot marry someone who doubts me.

540
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:11,360
Did you run away from there?

541
00:52:12,110 --> 00:52:13,860
What do you intend to do now?

542
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:16,640
Travel.

543
00:52:17,730 --> 00:52:18,910
With?

544
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:22,570
With the one who gave me a new life.

545
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:32,150
Will this do?

546
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:36,200
Yes, it will do.

547
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:40,200
If not this then that will do.

548
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:51,020
Wow! What a beautiful love story.

549
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:52,830
I want a treat.

550
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:57,140
Full tummy buffalo.

551
00:52:59,170 --> 00:53:01,690
What rubbish.
Did he call me buffalo?

552
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:04,230
I asked for a treat.

553
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:09,230
Your grandfather found
such a beautiful wife.

554
00:53:09,310 --> 00:53:11,340
I deserve a treat. Right?

555
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:15,580
Well the thing is I can
only offer you my blood and skin.

556
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:18,170
Bite me, and enjoy.

557
00:53:19,670 --> 00:53:22,050
I don't want your blood.

558
00:53:22,130 --> 00:53:23,860
I want coke.

559
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:25,560
Take a right turn.

560
00:53:25,650 --> 00:53:29,570
- Let's stop at a gas station.
Let's party. - I like you.

561
00:53:29,650 --> 00:53:32,460
Both is stupid.

562
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:37,360
Don't mind him.
He gets angry sometimes.

563
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,360
He is very hungry.

564
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:46,050
He became a good driver.

565
00:54:03,510 --> 00:54:04,900
I've got a point.

566
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:07,390
Can I give you an advice?

567
00:54:09,850 --> 00:54:11,860
Hello? An advice.

568
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:13,380
Did you just curse me?

569
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:16,650
Mental case. Can I give you an advice?

570
00:54:16,730 --> 00:54:18,900
Evil speaks, evil does.

571
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:20,490
What does that mean?

572
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:23,120
Dead man speaks, tear the shirt.

573
00:54:23,850 --> 00:54:25,150
Very bad joke.

574
00:54:25,230 --> 00:54:30,330
Anyway, I was wondering as it
is a celebration of a Punjabi wedding.

575
00:54:30,410 --> 00:54:33,440
That too your grandfather
and grandmother's.

576
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,780
It was such a beautiful love story.

577
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:39,250
So we should have a grand celebration.

578
00:54:41,090 --> 00:54:42,460
Champagne?

579
00:54:45,590 --> 00:54:47,980
Okay, not in your budget.

580
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:49,980
- No problem.
- That..

581
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,610
Wine?

582
00:54:54,690 --> 00:54:55,750
What do you think Billa?

583
00:54:55,830 --> 00:54:57,360
Yeah!

584
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:58,360
Yes!

585
00:54:58,440 --> 00:54:59,840
Yes, yes, yes.

586
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:02,870
Billing, please.

587
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:08,110
What is this, a Punjabi dress, for me?

588
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:10,680
Wait a second.

589
00:55:11,630 --> 00:55:16,290
I just took a lift from you,
to go be with my boyfriend.

590
00:55:16,670 --> 00:55:19,980
I hope you aren't
thinking too much into it.

591
00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:26,530
Change your name from
Simmi to Delusional.

592
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:29,400
- What?
- Doubt.

593
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:33,440
Idiot.

594
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:34,850
Dumbo.

595
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,810
Come on, quickly get her into the car.

596
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:48,860
I said keep quiet.

597
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:54,230
Come on, brother. Hurry up.

598
00:55:54,310 --> 00:55:55,590
Billa!

599
00:56:06,110 --> 00:56:07,960
- Billa!
- Yes?

600
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:09,640
Who the f**k is he?

601
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,210
Stop him.

602
00:56:18,430 --> 00:56:19,940
We are not engaged to you, man.

603
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:22,200
This is between us. Leave.

604
00:56:27,770 --> 00:56:29,940
You are still carrying an old pistol?

605
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:32,470
This was used back
in the second world war.

606
00:56:32,550 --> 00:56:35,930
45's bullets are thick, they
get stuck in the barrel sometimes.

607
00:56:36,010 --> 00:56:37,940
This won't work.
The bullet will get stuck in it.

608
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:39,930
It's barrel is rusted and defective.

609
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:42,140
Oh, f**k.

610
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:45,540
I am not a fool.
Don't try to be smart.

611
00:57:17,390 --> 00:57:19,240
Let's go.

612
00:57:29,630 --> 00:57:32,560
Oh, my God! That was so scary.

613
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:35,420
I thought I was going to die today.

614
00:57:36,010 --> 00:57:39,290
But somewhere in my heart I knew..

615
00:57:39,530 --> 00:57:43,550
..that Neek Singh's grandson,
will be a gentleman.

616
00:57:46,910 --> 00:57:49,480
- What happened now?
- Get down.

617
00:57:50,150 --> 00:57:51,720
You want me to get down?

618
00:57:52,730 --> 00:57:53,950
What happened now?

619
00:57:54,030 --> 00:57:58,320
What happened?
Baba is angry, he is furious.

620
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:03,530
- But..
- Get down. She doesn't move. Come on.

621
00:58:03,610 --> 00:58:06,650
Come on. Go.

622
00:58:06,730 --> 00:58:08,970
- Move it. Go away. Go. Go.
- Wait, wait, wait.

623
00:58:09,050 --> 00:58:10,900
Look, listen to me, listen to me.

624
00:58:11,130 --> 00:58:12,290
Hello!

625
00:58:13,370 --> 00:58:15,610
- What did I do wrong now?
- You are a fraud.

626
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:19,440
Your got trapped
in your own screenplay.

627
00:58:20,050 --> 00:58:22,120
You were going to meet your boyfriend.

628
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:24,360
You also said you want to get married.

629
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:28,230
These people who had come to kill you,
were they your father?

630
00:58:28,310 --> 00:58:29,730
Were they there to bless you?

631
00:58:29,810 --> 00:58:33,590
It's nothing.
They were criminals. Killers.

632
00:58:33,970 --> 00:58:35,270
I couldn't help it.

633
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:37,860
I was running for my life.

634
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:40,020
I couldn't trust anyone.

635
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:43,290
I had no one I could
trust and tell the truth.

636
00:58:46,230 --> 00:58:47,400
I was scared.

637
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:51,170
What if you too would have refused?
Then what would I do?

638
00:58:51,250 --> 00:58:54,060
Walk to Calgary or die?

639
00:58:54,690 --> 00:58:57,730
Tell me? Listen to me just once.

640
00:58:57,810 --> 00:59:00,860
Seriously. This time,
I'm going to tell you the truth.

641
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:02,630
Just one last time.

642
00:59:03,150 --> 00:59:04,490
Tell me.

643
00:59:08,550 --> 00:59:11,650
Simmi! Lock the storeroom.

644
00:59:11,730 --> 00:59:13,120
- Okay.
- Okay?

645
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:27,900
J&amp;B!

646
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:30,040
Sorry sir, bar is closed.

647
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:32,110
We didn't ask about that, chick.

648
00:59:32,190 --> 00:59:35,630
We ordered some drinks.
Sorry sir, can't do that now.

649
00:59:35,710 --> 00:59:38,020
The bar is closed. Please leave.

650
00:59:38,110 --> 00:59:40,860
You're refusing us?
In our country?

651
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:42,230
Our city?

652
00:59:42,310 --> 00:59:43,770
Come on, make us some drinks..

653
00:59:43,850 --> 00:59:45,940
..or else I'll show you
what happens when you say no.

654
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:48,010
Sorry ma'am, we are closed.

655
00:59:48,090 --> 00:59:50,810
Jaz, it's okay.
Let me talk to them.

656
00:59:50,890 --> 00:59:54,950
Look guys, she said no.
And that means no.

657
00:59:55,950 --> 00:59:59,340
Now get out of here
or I'll call the police.

658
00:59:59,830 --> 01:00:01,850
We're scared, aren't we?

659
01:00:01,930 --> 01:00:03,940
Can you see how scared we are?

660
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:06,470
Let me teach you a lesson,
you little b*it*h.

661
01:00:06,550 --> 01:00:07,890
B*it*h?

662
01:00:07,970 --> 01:00:10,610
Not a b*t*h,
you are messing with a lioness.

663
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:11,980
White boy.

664
01:00:12,060 --> 01:00:13,510
What did you say?

665
01:00:14,290 --> 01:00:16,650
Now how do I explain it in English.

666
01:00:16,730 --> 01:00:21,440
That Simmi hits where it hurts.

667
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:24,650
- Get out! Get out right now! Get out!
- I am not leaving.

668
01:00:24,730 --> 01:00:26,860
Seriously,
it's not that big of a deal.

669
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:29,320
Get out! No! No!

670
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:30,610
No, get out!

671
01:00:30,690 --> 01:00:32,000
I'm not leaving, okay?

672
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:34,400
- You gotta get out right now.
- I am not a b*t*h, I am a lioness.

673
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:36,170
I know my rights, okay?

674
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:39,860
I won't spare you. Leave me alone.

675
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:43,980
- What're you doing?
- Hey, you can't touch me.

676
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:45,820
- No, you can't hit me.
- Dare you!

677
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:47,570
What're you doing?

678
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:54,140
What did you do?

679
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:57,690
- Come on, run!
- Jaz!

680
01:00:57,770 --> 01:00:58,610
- We gotta go!
- Jaz!

681
01:00:58,690 --> 01:01:00,520
- What did you do bro! Let's
get out of here. - Right now! Run!

682
01:01:00,610 --> 01:01:01,980
Are you okay?

683
01:01:02,060 --> 01:01:04,570
I am so sorry. We need help.

684
01:01:04,650 --> 01:01:05,710
Help!

685
01:01:11,370 --> 01:01:15,800
So you want me to believe
in your lie like before?

686
01:01:16,990 --> 01:01:18,940
This time it is not a lie.

687
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:21,590
Look at me.

688
01:01:23,090 --> 01:01:28,180
Trust me only if you think
that I'm telling the truth.

689
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:30,230
Really?

690
01:01:30,540 --> 01:01:33,210
Can I believe you?

691
01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:28,730
Who are you?

692
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:29,980
Simmi here.

693
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:31,430
Where are you?

694
01:02:31,990 --> 01:02:34,570
I won't be telling you that. No way!

695
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:35,870
What do you mean by that?

696
01:02:35,950 --> 01:02:37,570
Yeah, I mean it.

697
01:02:37,650 --> 01:02:38,820
You said I am safe.

698
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:41,130
I have already been attacked twice.

699
01:02:41,210 --> 01:02:42,440
You know what?

700
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:44,490
You were supposed to protect me.

701
01:02:44,570 --> 01:02:45,770
And I am not safe.

702
01:02:45,850 --> 01:02:47,650
Listen, I told you so many times..

703
01:02:47,740 --> 01:02:49,240
..those people are very dangerous.

704
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:50,670
That's why I am worried about you.

705
01:02:50,750 --> 01:02:52,790
After it is my duty to protect you.

706
01:02:52,870 --> 01:02:54,660
Then why didn't you
perform your duty well.

707
01:02:54,740 --> 01:02:57,240
I am very sorry.
It won't happen again.

708
01:02:57,320 --> 01:02:59,290
Tell me, where are you now?

709
01:02:59,370 --> 01:03:01,530
I said no, means no.

710
01:03:02,210 --> 01:03:04,980
Now I'll manage to
get to Calgary on my own.

711
01:03:07,230 --> 01:03:08,670
Thank you so much!

712
01:03:08,750 --> 01:03:10,780
You deserve a hug. Oh, not you.

713
01:03:11,950 --> 01:03:13,170
Thank you.

714
01:03:13,530 --> 01:03:15,210
You were very kind.

715
01:03:15,810 --> 01:03:17,820
I know, Mr. Neek Singh.

716
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:20,810
But your principles don't
work in this generation.

717
01:03:21,740 --> 01:03:23,950
- No.
- He is right, grandpa.

718
01:03:24,030 --> 01:03:26,150
Your son is right.

719
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:27,830
How does it concern us?

720
01:03:28,410 --> 01:03:31,610
Whether she is from Punjab or Bengal.

721
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:34,910
Whether she is alone or with an army.

722
01:03:34,990 --> 01:03:37,530
Whether her story is true or fake.

723
01:03:37,610 --> 01:03:39,400
She might be telling the truth.

724
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:45,950
How does it concern us whether
someone shoots her or slit her throat.

725
01:03:46,030 --> 01:03:47,970
With hands or a knife?

726
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:51,190
If you want to kill her
then just kill her.

727
01:03:51,270 --> 01:03:53,260
You drive on. Go on.

728
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:07,860
So we are going back now?

729
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:32,020
Hey, helpless girl. Get in.

730
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:33,800
Get in.

731
01:04:39,070 --> 01:04:40,450
Get in.

732
01:04:40,530 --> 01:04:42,850
You shouldn't be stubborn.

733
01:04:42,930 --> 01:04:44,820
You won't find such emotional
people like us in Canada..

734
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:48,270
..even if you go looking
with a torch in hand.

735
01:04:48,350 --> 01:04:51,970
If there were others like us you would've
reached a lift by now. Don't act smart.

736
01:04:52,050 --> 01:04:54,570
You will die. You will freeze. Get in.

737
01:04:54,650 --> 01:04:57,570
Tell your boss to first
come here and apologize.

738
01:04:57,650 --> 01:04:59,450
Hello, madam.

739
01:04:59,530 --> 01:05:02,090
He won't apologize. Right?

740
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:03,950
Right?

741
01:05:04,030 --> 01:05:06,820
Billa, I don't have time to waste.
I'll count only till three.

742
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:09,530
Hello, we will count
only till three. Get in.

743
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:12,410
One.

744
01:05:13,070 --> 01:05:14,410
Two.

745
01:05:19,620 --> 01:05:21,160
Three!

746
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:23,290
- She's coming!
- Wait!

747
01:05:23,370 --> 01:05:25,900
Your boss is very unromantic.

748
01:05:25,980 --> 01:05:27,770
He doesn't care about me.

749
01:05:35,590 --> 01:05:37,320
Thank you, Mr. Neek Singh.

750
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:40,150
I am sure he returned
only because of you.

751
01:05:48,910 --> 01:05:51,980
Don't yawn, or I will feel lazy too.

752
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:56,620
Okay listen, now I am very sleepy.

753
01:05:56,700 --> 01:05:58,570
I think I'm going to sleep.

754
01:05:58,650 --> 01:06:03,020
Please play some soothing
instrumental music.

755
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:07,650
I'll play Bismillah Khan's Shehnai.

756
01:06:08,100 --> 01:06:10,110
Go to sleep.
For God's sake, go to sleep.

757
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:11,820
And keep sleeping.

758
01:06:16,740 --> 01:06:18,190
Hey, hello?

759
01:06:18,460 --> 01:06:20,210
Do you want to leave or stay?

760
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,580
This isn't a pillow, it's a gift.

761
01:06:22,890 --> 01:06:24,280
Oh really?

762
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:27,320
Did you come back because
of that Punjabi dress?

763
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:29,240
Don't assume anything.

764
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:31,430
I just took a lift from you.

765
01:06:31,510 --> 01:06:33,400
Did you take a lift or gave one?

766
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:36,140
Oh I see.
And who is this dress for then?

767
01:06:36,220 --> 01:06:38,040
It's for Kiran.

768
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:39,650
Kiran?

769
01:06:39,740 --> 01:06:42,850
Who is this? K.. Kiran?

770
01:06:43,210 --> 01:06:44,360
The love of Binder's life.

771
01:06:44,450 --> 01:06:47,400
I am neither longer sleepy nor hungry.

772
01:06:47,780 --> 01:06:52,610
Let's listen to Binder
and Kiran's love story.

773
01:06:53,890 --> 01:06:56,860
Sometimes like Sohni, Sahiba, Heer..

774
01:07:02,610 --> 01:07:05,370
Sometimes like a poet's muse..

775
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:16,380
Sometimes like a sketch
made by a lover..

776
01:07:42,370 --> 01:07:47,470
"Sometimes like Sohni, Sahiba, Heer.."

777
01:07:47,550 --> 01:07:52,950
"- Sometimes like a poet's muse..
- Wonderful!"

778
01:08:07,570 --> 01:08:14,770
"Sometimes like a sketch
made by a lover.."

779
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:29,310
Oh God, did it have to breakdown now?

780
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:32,570
Couldn't you break down elsewhere?

781
01:08:33,310 --> 01:08:35,840
I can't see anyone
here who would help me.

782
01:08:36,370 --> 01:08:40,390
Brother will be upset
because I'll get late.

783
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:58,400
Oh God, why did this driver get down?

784
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:06,000
What's wrong, girl?

785
01:09:06,150 --> 01:09:07,260
Nothing.

786
01:09:07,610 --> 01:09:08,610
Nothing?

787
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:11,450
I am talking about this
scooter and not about you.

788
01:09:11,530 --> 01:09:12,820
Nothing.

789
01:09:12,900 --> 01:09:14,660
Then you are pushing it for fun?

790
01:09:14,740 --> 01:09:16,650
It has broken down.
But how does it concern you?

791
01:09:16,740 --> 01:09:19,400
Is this how you talk to
people who come to help you?

792
01:09:19,490 --> 01:09:21,740
If a bad person asks
then it is a bad thing.

793
01:09:21,820 --> 01:09:23,320
Do I look like a bad person?

794
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:25,750
Truck drivers aren't good people.

795
01:09:26,090 --> 01:09:29,440
Truck drivers drink alcohol.
They trouble girls.

796
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:31,570
They keep twisting their moustaches.

797
01:09:31,650 --> 01:09:34,450
How do you know that?
Do you work as a clerk at the PNA?

798
01:09:34,530 --> 01:09:37,290
My friend had told
me about truck drivers.

799
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:39,740
Okay. Okay.

800
01:09:39,820 --> 01:09:41,920
Is your friend having
an affair with a driver?

801
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,970
Disgusting! What are you saying?

802
01:09:44,310 --> 01:09:46,110
Your scooter has broken down.

803
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:47,900
You don't want to seek driver's help.

804
01:09:47,990 --> 01:09:49,780
This is such an isolated road.

805
01:09:49,860 --> 01:09:51,360
What if something goes wrong?

806
01:09:51,450 --> 01:09:54,300
Call home,
I'll wait till someone shows up.

807
01:09:54,380 --> 01:09:56,650
My phone's battery has conked.

808
01:09:56,730 --> 01:09:57,860
Right.

809
01:09:57,950 --> 01:10:01,400
You spend the whole day on snapchat.
The battery is bound to get drained.

810
01:10:01,490 --> 01:10:02,860
Why don't you install a
truck's battery in your phone.

811
01:10:02,950 --> 01:10:04,860
Use my phone to call.

812
01:10:04,950 --> 01:10:06,250
I'll wait.

813
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:07,740
From your phone?

814
01:10:07,820 --> 01:10:09,240
Why? Do you have a problem?

815
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:13,990
What will I say when my family
asks whose phone am I calling from?

816
01:10:14,070 --> 01:10:16,280
That I am calling from
a truck driver's phone.

817
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:18,030
Move aside then, I'll repair it.

818
01:10:18,110 --> 01:10:19,570
Why should I listen to you?

819
01:10:19,650 --> 01:10:21,400
There is alcohol in my truck.

820
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:23,280
Do you want me to get
drunk and twist my moustaches?

821
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:24,950
Come on, move back.

822
01:10:41,990 --> 01:10:43,660
There, it has started.

823
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:48,070
No thank you before you leave?

824
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:52,230
Thank you.

825
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:12,320
There, even Binder is here.

826
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:14,160
He is a very nice person.

827
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:16,830
He never behaves like a boss.

828
01:11:16,910 --> 01:11:19,150
He owns such a big transport company..

829
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:21,610
..and yet you can see him
on a truck more than the drivers.

830
01:11:21,690 --> 01:11:26,030
- That's why he owns such
a big transport company. - True.

831
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:32,280
As the elders say,
hard work always pays.

832
01:11:32,550 --> 01:11:36,000
His father has started
the tradition of working hard.

833
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:40,620
That's why he and his uncle
are having a good life these days.

834
01:11:41,150 --> 01:11:42,560
Take It.

835
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:45,220
I have got your 5570 repaired.

836
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:47,270
Don't break your head over it again.

837
01:11:47,350 --> 01:11:52,640
Son, trucks gets repaired with the
love and affection your family gives.

838
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:55,910
I hope you didn't waste
money on a mechanic.

839
01:11:55,990 --> 01:11:58,990
What's true for the
cards ain't true for people.

840
01:11:59,450 --> 01:12:00,240
Bye.

841
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:04,070
Hello, Mr. Neek Singh.

842
01:12:04,150 --> 01:12:05,910
Times have changed.

843
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:08,500
First wooden Mercury then Ace.

844
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:11,160
Then Ashok Leyland.

845
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:13,400
Now even Mercedes has
started manufacturing trucks.

846
01:12:14,630 --> 01:12:16,710
But one thing hasn't changed. Girls.

847
01:12:17,220 --> 01:12:19,060
Same old story.

848
01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:23,200
Truck drivers get drunk.
They trouble girls.

849
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:24,740
They twist their moustaches.

850
01:12:24,820 --> 01:12:27,240
If we have them,
we will twist them for sure.

851
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:29,290
Is uncle permitted to
interrupt this conversation..

852
01:12:29,990 --> 01:12:32,200
..between grandfather and grandson?

853
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:34,390
Where have you been, uncle?

854
01:12:36,860 --> 01:12:38,890
Sucha Singh from Gagan.

855
01:12:39,450 --> 01:12:40,900
They have organized ladies
musical ceremony at their residence.

856
01:12:40,990 --> 01:12:42,150
We need to go there tomorrow.

857
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:44,910
Sure, you can go.

858
01:12:44,990 --> 01:12:46,570
You will go with me.

859
01:12:46,650 --> 01:12:47,860
What will I do there?

860
01:12:47,950 --> 01:12:50,570
Gama's truck has broken down.
It's making a lot of noise.

861
01:12:50,650 --> 01:12:52,160
He has to go to Bombay.

862
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:55,110
- I was thinking of
repairing its chassis. - Damn.

863
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:59,000
I have noticed that my father,
my brother and you.

864
01:12:59,530 --> 01:13:03,240
Have spent your life
romancing these trucks.

865
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:05,000
Stupid!

866
01:13:05,570 --> 01:13:09,700
You should enjoy
a few parties as well.

867
01:13:09,780 --> 01:13:13,450
Who knows, you might end
up liking a living creation of God.

868
01:13:14,870 --> 01:13:18,530
Uncle, you are such
a pervert even at this age.

869
01:13:20,070 --> 01:13:23,090
Men and horses never grow old, nephew.

870
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:25,950
Fine, uncle.

871
01:13:26,030 --> 01:13:29,490
If you insist, I'll go there.

872
01:13:29,870 --> 01:13:33,780
Who knows,
I might meet someone accidentally.

873
01:13:37,450 --> 01:13:40,000
Brother, ask her why is so late?

874
01:13:41,740 --> 01:13:43,610
Brother, my scooter had broken down.

875
01:13:43,700 --> 01:13:44,820
And my phone's battery was also dead.

876
01:13:44,900 --> 01:13:47,490
Can't you change
your tuition's timings?

877
01:13:48,030 --> 01:13:50,810
Your education is of no good to us.

878
01:13:51,610 --> 01:13:53,430
We are getting you educated..

879
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:56,820
..but that doesn't mean we give
you the license to do as you please.

880
01:13:56,900 --> 01:13:59,400
- Do you understand?
- What do you mean?

881
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:02,300
Come here, girl.

882
01:14:07,810 --> 01:14:10,270
You should mind your manners
while talking to a girl.

883
01:14:10,530 --> 01:14:12,340
You are pampering her a lot, mother.

884
01:14:12,420 --> 01:14:14,590
I have pampered you all, not her!

885
01:14:14,670 --> 01:14:17,570
You couldn't even clear high school.

886
01:14:17,650 --> 01:14:20,760
She is dedicative towards
studying so why don't let her?

887
01:14:37,530 --> 01:14:42,400
"When you walk, my heart stops."

888
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:44,860
Let's go now.

889
01:14:44,950 --> 01:14:47,870
Go where?
My legs are yet to start hurting.

890
01:14:48,530 --> 01:14:50,070
When will we leave then?

891
01:14:50,150 --> 01:14:52,490
My brothers will kill me.

892
01:14:52,570 --> 01:14:55,110
- Let's go.
- "You have stepped out of the house.."

893
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:57,570
Come on, Kiran.
You can dance in your own house.

894
01:14:57,650 --> 01:14:59,400
You have ruined my mood now.

895
01:14:59,490 --> 01:15:00,700
Neither are you having a good time..

896
01:15:00,780 --> 01:15:02,290
..nor are you letting
me have a good time.

897
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:04,940
You always do that.

898
01:15:08,150 --> 01:15:12,240
"She applies henna on her heels
and walks on toes."

899
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:13,280
Listen, let's go.

900
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:15,240
- Where?
- Let's go inside.

901
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:18,200
"She applies henna on her heels
and walks on toes."

902
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:19,360
Why? Has the auspicious
hour began now?

903
01:15:19,450 --> 01:15:20,610
Let's go and dance on the stage.

904
01:15:20,700 --> 01:15:21,530
Let's dance till your legs hurt.

905
01:15:21,610 --> 01:15:22,860
Or else you will say that
I didn't let you dance.

906
01:15:22,950 --> 01:15:23,860
Stop pulling my arm.

907
01:15:23,950 --> 01:15:26,070
- Let's go. Come on.
- Hurry up.

908
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:32,820
Should we go give the gift?

909
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:34,240
You go ahead, uncle.

910
01:15:35,150 --> 01:15:36,460
Okay.

911
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:46,860
"She wants to swim Chenab."

912
01:15:46,950 --> 01:15:49,400
"She wants to take Babbu's name."

913
01:15:49,490 --> 01:15:54,930
"She wants to find Mirza,
she wants to catch hold of Majhnu."

914
01:15:55,010 --> 01:15:57,490
"She wants to catch hold of Majhnu."

915
01:15:57,570 --> 01:15:59,700
"She wants to swim Chenab."

916
01:15:59,780 --> 01:16:02,520
"She wants to take Babbu's name."

917
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:04,820
"She wants to find Mirza."

918
01:16:04,900 --> 01:16:08,230
"She wants to catch hold of Majhnu."

919
01:16:09,890 --> 01:16:15,070
"This piece of jaggery melts on fire."

920
01:16:15,150 --> 01:16:20,300
"She applies henna on her heels
and walks on toes."

921
01:16:20,380 --> 01:16:25,910
"You have stepped out of the house,
now there is no going back for you."

922
01:16:27,170 --> 01:16:28,950
Okay, so I have done my duty here.

923
01:16:29,030 --> 01:16:30,490
Shall we leave now?

924
01:16:30,940 --> 01:16:34,640
- Can we wait for a few more minutes?
- Why?

925
01:16:37,990 --> 01:16:39,740
So that I can socialize a little?

926
01:16:39,820 --> 01:16:42,240
You need to give the
truck back to Dharma.

927
01:16:44,780 --> 01:16:46,030
Dharma won't be coming.

928
01:16:46,110 --> 01:16:47,160
Why?

929
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:49,570
Dharma isn't well.

930
01:16:49,650 --> 01:16:51,210
- Really?
- Yes.

931
01:16:51,420 --> 01:16:53,240
I think you aren't well either.

932
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:55,160
I was a pervert so now you.

933
01:16:59,730 --> 01:17:00,780
Let's go.

934
01:17:01,250 --> 01:17:02,390
Come on.

935
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:04,450
Come on, now.

936
01:17:35,580 --> 01:17:36,780
Standing in the middle of the road.

937
01:17:36,860 --> 01:17:38,220
Do you have a death wish?

938
01:17:38,700 --> 01:17:40,140
Move aside.

939
01:17:40,220 --> 01:17:42,110
Can't you see that it has broken down?

940
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:43,900
It had broken down the other day.

941
01:17:43,990 --> 01:17:45,360
Today you are just
pretending that it is.

942
01:17:45,450 --> 01:17:46,810
How do you know?

943
01:17:47,180 --> 01:17:50,840
My truck can carry
500 scooters to Bombay.

944
01:17:51,370 --> 01:17:56,650
I can touch and know whether my truck
has high blood pressure or low sugar.

945
01:17:56,740 --> 01:17:58,120
Move aside.

946
01:17:58,200 --> 01:17:59,110
No.

947
01:17:59,190 --> 01:18:02,280
Truck drivers get drunk.

948
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:04,590
They twist their moustaches.

949
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:07,220
They trouble girls as well.

950
01:18:07,300 --> 01:18:10,320
Now I know that people lie.

951
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:11,490
I see.

952
01:18:11,570 --> 01:18:13,490
There are so good
truck drivers are well.

953
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:20,070
Forgive me, dear.
Your scooter is working just fine.

954
01:18:20,150 --> 01:18:23,260
Yes, but there is
something wrong with me.

955
01:18:23,850 --> 01:18:25,950
I think I have caught the love fever.

956
01:18:26,030 --> 01:18:29,150
There is a cure for dengue.
But there is no cure for love.

957
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:34,910
Oh no. I will get
cured if you support me.

958
01:19:35,100 --> 01:19:36,990
Whom do I call next?

959
01:19:40,650 --> 01:19:43,160
Is everything fine, uncle?
You look upset. What is wrong?

960
01:19:43,240 --> 01:19:45,990
Nothing. Druggie Pal who drives 9090?

961
01:19:46,070 --> 01:19:47,780
- Yes?
- He ran away.

962
01:19:47,860 --> 01:19:49,070
His truck is loaded.

963
01:19:49,150 --> 01:19:50,400
Goods need to reach Kolkata.

964
01:19:50,490 --> 01:19:51,860
I don't know what to do now.

965
01:19:51,950 --> 01:19:53,660
It's okay.
It can go tomorrow morning.

966
01:19:54,530 --> 01:19:55,710
Well done.

967
01:19:55,990 --> 01:19:58,110
What's the use after the need is gone?

968
01:19:58,200 --> 01:20:00,610
It is loaded with
firecrackers, stupid.

969
01:20:00,700 --> 01:20:02,030
Diwali is approaching.

970
01:20:02,110 --> 01:20:03,780
It's okay, they can use
it for Guru Nanak Jayanti instead.

971
01:20:03,860 --> 01:20:05,650
- It's not a big deal.
- Listen!

972
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:09,900
I am not going this time.

973
01:20:09,990 --> 01:20:11,070
Go there.

974
01:20:11,150 --> 01:20:14,150
Who knows, you might end up
liking a living creation of God there.

975
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:16,740
Who knows I might
end up meeting one here?

976
01:20:16,820 --> 01:20:18,110
Here? What's here?

977
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:19,900
You won't understand, uncle.

978
01:20:19,980 --> 01:20:21,700
This is between me and Neek Singh.

979
01:20:21,780 --> 01:20:23,820
- Okay.
- Yes.

980
01:20:23,900 --> 01:20:26,110
So love is in the air.

981
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:29,010
Hats off to that girl..

982
01:20:29,090 --> 01:20:31,780
..who made your heart
beat like other boys.

983
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:36,350
But remember son,
the romance that you are doing..

984
01:20:36,430 --> 01:20:38,860
..you will need my help
to take things further.

985
01:20:38,950 --> 01:20:41,650
So my boy, go deliver the goods.

986
01:20:41,740 --> 01:20:43,650
Okay, I'll see.

987
01:20:44,570 --> 01:20:46,590
- I'll seek advice.
- Okay.

988
01:20:46,670 --> 01:20:49,700
So you seek advice
from someone other than me.

989
01:21:10,670 --> 01:21:13,160
You have found a
nice meeting place here.

990
01:21:14,250 --> 01:21:17,640
You sit here and keep
staring at this dirty pond.

991
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:19,950
This is a swimming pool for buffalos.

992
01:21:20,450 --> 01:21:21,990
Buffalos are bathed here.

993
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:25,780
Now can buffalos who
provide us with milk be dirty?

994
01:21:25,860 --> 01:21:27,580
There is a solution.

995
01:21:27,930 --> 01:21:34,910
Tell your father to form
a mineral water lake here.

996
01:21:35,270 --> 01:21:38,650
I don't understand your philosophies,
Waris Shah.

997
01:21:39,150 --> 01:21:40,610
It's okay.

998
01:21:40,700 --> 01:21:43,490
You have a lifetime
left to understand.

999
01:21:43,570 --> 01:21:44,820
For the time being you should know..

1000
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:46,870
..that the driver
has contracted dengue..

1001
01:21:46,950 --> 01:21:51,600
..so I will have to go
to Kolkata instead of the driver.

1002
01:21:52,110 --> 01:21:53,640
Kolkata?

1003
01:21:54,450 --> 01:21:55,650
When will you come back?

1004
01:21:55,740 --> 01:21:57,240
In 10 days.

1005
01:21:57,320 --> 01:21:58,990
10 days!

1006
01:21:59,070 --> 01:22:01,160
I'll go crazy in 10 days.

1007
01:22:03,340 --> 01:22:05,040
What is 10 days?

1008
01:22:06,050 --> 01:22:08,660
5 days to go and 5 days to come back.

1009
01:22:08,740 --> 01:22:10,400
I will be with you the next day.

1010
01:22:10,850 --> 01:22:12,280
10 days!

1011
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:14,340
Do you know how long that is?

1012
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:33,690
You are Binder?

1013
01:23:33,770 --> 01:23:35,100
Yes. And you are Deepi?

1014
01:23:35,190 --> 01:23:36,090
Yes.

1015
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:39,910
Her family has gone
to send her to Canada.

1016
01:23:40,540 --> 01:23:42,400
They left?

1017
01:23:42,590 --> 01:23:43,870
She didn't go willingly.

1018
01:23:43,950 --> 01:23:46,150
They forced her to go with her aunt.

1019
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:50,900
She doesn't have her aunt's address.

1020
01:23:50,980 --> 01:23:56,300
But she has told me
that she lives in Surrey.

1021
01:23:56,730 --> 01:23:58,040
Any message?

1022
01:23:58,120 --> 01:24:02,980
She cried and said
that she'll wait for you..

1023
01:24:03,060 --> 01:24:05,750
..till you don't
come to take her back.

1024
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:08,840
Thank you.

1025
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:54,140
"My heart is inconsolable."

1026
01:24:54,220 --> 01:24:57,720
"How do I console it?"

1027
01:24:58,810 --> 01:25:02,470
"My heart is inconsolable."

1028
01:25:02,550 --> 01:25:05,940
"How do I console it?"

1029
01:25:06,770 --> 01:25:15,630
"How do distract it from love.."

1030
01:25:16,950 --> 01:25:26,050
"How do distract it from love
and divert its attention elsewhere?"

1031
01:25:26,130 --> 01:25:29,590
"My heart is inconsolable."

1032
01:25:29,670 --> 01:25:33,190
"How do I console it?"

1033
01:25:34,140 --> 01:25:37,940
"My heart is inconsolable."

1034
01:25:38,020 --> 01:25:42,380
"How do I console it?"

1035
01:26:07,830 --> 01:26:11,980
"Like a child when
carried around the waist."

1036
01:26:12,060 --> 01:26:15,270
"It keeps slipping away.

1037
01:26:15,350 --> 01:26:23,950
"How do I see it break
right before my eyes?"

1038
01:26:28,690 --> 01:26:32,840
"Like a child when
carried around the waist."

1039
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:36,190
"It keeps slipping away.

1040
01:26:36,270 --> 01:26:44,800
"How do I see it break
right before my eyes?"

1041
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:53,770
"How do I stop a dead body
from floating away in the water?"

1042
01:26:53,850 --> 01:26:57,250
"My heart is inconsolable."

1043
01:26:57,330 --> 01:27:00,950
"How do I console it?"

1044
01:27:02,210 --> 01:27:05,590
"My heart is inconsolable."

1045
01:27:05,670 --> 01:27:09,950
"How do I console it?"

1046
01:27:20,990 --> 01:27:28,690
"Being with you was like
going to a pilgrimage for me."

1047
01:27:28,770 --> 01:27:37,230
"Even if you commit a hundred crimes,
I'd forgive you."

1048
01:27:41,850 --> 01:27:49,500
"Being with you was like
going to a pilgrimage for me."

1049
01:27:49,580 --> 01:27:58,020
"Even if you commit a hundred crimes,
I'd forgive you."

1050
01:27:58,100 --> 01:28:01,780
"I'd skin myself.."

1051
01:28:01,860 --> 01:28:06,320
"And let you make slippers of them."

1052
01:28:06,910 --> 01:28:10,320
"My heart is inconsolable."

1053
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:13,920
"How do I console it?"

1054
01:28:14,890 --> 01:28:18,660
"My heart is inconsolable."

1055
01:28:18,740 --> 01:28:23,040
"How do I console it?"

1056
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:52,700
"I am tired of explaining."

1057
01:28:52,780 --> 01:28:56,940
"It didn't stop even
after getting hurt."

1058
01:28:57,020 --> 01:29:00,730
"It says this world isn't so bad."

1059
01:29:00,810 --> 01:29:05,270
"I should give it a try again."

1060
01:29:09,410 --> 01:29:13,520
"I am tired of explaining."

1061
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:17,800
"It didn't stop even
after getting hurt."

1062
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:21,510
"It says this world isn't so bad."

1063
01:29:21,590 --> 01:29:25,150
"I should give it a try again."

1064
01:29:25,230 --> 01:29:29,940
"My heart and my mind.."

1065
01:29:30,020 --> 01:29:34,450
"Are guiding me to different paths."

1066
01:29:34,530 --> 01:29:37,940
"My heart is inconsolable."

1067
01:29:38,020 --> 01:29:41,750
"How do I console it?"

1068
01:29:42,750 --> 01:29:46,110
"My heart is inconsolable."

1069
01:29:46,300 --> 01:29:50,330
"How do I console it?"

1070
01:30:56,630 --> 01:30:58,960
You'll enjoy these sights initially.

1071
01:30:59,040 --> 01:31:00,360
Hey, hello.

1072
01:31:01,160 --> 01:31:03,410
Fasten your seatbelt, man.

1073
01:31:03,680 --> 01:31:05,420
I am the one who can help you.

1074
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:07,920
I will show you around as well.

1075
01:31:09,190 --> 01:31:12,410
To teach you how to drive.
To get you a license.

1076
01:31:12,490 --> 01:31:14,390
It is all my responsibility.

1077
01:31:15,560 --> 01:31:18,050
I taught you how to
ride a full size cycle.

1078
01:31:19,410 --> 01:31:21,810
We aren't going to discuss that.
About the cycle.

1079
01:31:21,890 --> 01:31:24,150
You troubled me a
lot while teaching me.

1080
01:31:24,230 --> 01:31:28,570
I couldn't even touch my feet.

1081
01:31:28,650 --> 01:31:31,550
Here I can't let go
of the steering wheel.

1082
01:31:31,630 --> 01:31:34,150
Can you ever reach the brakes?

1083
01:31:34,230 --> 01:31:36,680
There will be times
when I hit the brakes..

1084
01:31:36,760 --> 01:31:38,850
..and ask you to
hold the steering wheel.

1085
01:31:40,230 --> 01:31:42,520
God will save us.

1086
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:44,890
The blind manages to meet
the leper by chance.

1087
01:31:46,290 --> 01:31:49,370
I didn't expect to meet one so far away.

1088
01:31:50,060 --> 01:31:51,400
Just by chance.

1089
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:55,650
But who is blind
here and who is leper?

1090
01:31:55,730 --> 01:31:57,210
I am blind in love.

1091
01:31:57,900 --> 01:32:00,010
And Canada has made you a leper.

1092
01:32:00,350 --> 01:32:02,830
- Well said.
- Yes.

1093
01:32:02,910 --> 01:32:04,530
Leper. Blind.

1094
01:32:04,610 --> 01:32:08,140
Blinded by Kiran's love
I have reached Canada.

1095
01:32:54,450 --> 01:32:56,550
You are so lucky.

1096
01:32:56,630 --> 01:32:59,860
You got a driving license
in just two months.

1097
01:32:59,940 --> 01:33:02,380
Here you go.

1098
01:33:03,740 --> 01:33:05,100
Thank you.

1099
01:33:05,770 --> 01:33:08,440
Now you can go to
drink coffee in a truck.

1100
01:33:09,580 --> 01:33:13,690
And you know that it is hard
to survive without a car?

1101
01:33:13,770 --> 01:33:15,400
- License?
- What?

1102
01:33:16,270 --> 01:33:17,860
Kiran too must have made one then.

1103
01:33:22,840 --> 01:33:23,890
Oh, yeah.

1104
01:33:23,970 --> 01:33:27,200
One cannot do without a license here.

1105
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:28,770
Find out then.

1106
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:32,270
She must have made a license.

1107
01:33:32,350 --> 01:33:37,330
It will also contain
her name and address.

1108
01:33:52,520 --> 01:33:54,820
You have hit a jackpot.

1109
01:33:58,440 --> 01:34:01,600
I have got five addresses.
You are lucky.

1110
01:34:01,690 --> 01:34:02,810
Check it.

1111
01:34:02,900 --> 01:34:05,270
Now find out which one
of these Kiran is yours.

1112
01:34:35,220 --> 01:34:36,210
Who's there?

1113
01:34:36,770 --> 01:34:39,330
- Hello, aunt.
- Hello. Aunt?

1114
01:34:39,700 --> 01:34:43,770
I am Billi. Are you Kiran's aunt?

1115
01:34:43,850 --> 01:34:44,810
Yes.

1116
01:34:44,900 --> 01:34:46,520
Kiran used to stay here?

1117
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:49,370
Yes, she was.
But they moved to Calgary.

1118
01:34:49,870 --> 01:34:52,060
He is my friend.
He wanted to meet her.

1119
01:34:52,150 --> 01:34:54,400
Since he was here,
he thought he should meet her.

1120
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:55,570
They stay close back in the village.

1121
01:34:55,650 --> 01:34:58,560
- Can we get her number of something?
- Her address? Sure, I have it.

1122
01:34:58,650 --> 01:35:01,520
- Give me just a minute.
- So nice of you.

1123
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:04,770
- Here's her address.
- Oh, Yes! Thank you.

1124
01:35:04,850 --> 01:35:06,790
- It's her address?
- Yes.

1125
01:35:11,660 --> 01:35:13,490
Here you go, buddy.

1126
01:35:13,570 --> 01:35:14,940
We did it.

1127
01:35:15,020 --> 01:35:16,390
I got her address.

1128
01:35:16,470 --> 01:35:18,020
Kiran's address.

1129
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:28,970
Thank you.

1130
01:35:29,050 --> 01:35:30,440
Wow!

1131
01:35:30,930 --> 01:35:33,290
You are awesome, man.

1132
01:35:33,650 --> 01:35:36,320
Okay, I forgive you for every thing.

1133
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:38,480
I deserve a big treat now.

1134
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:39,980
- Right?
- Yes.

1135
01:35:40,060 --> 01:35:42,340
We should celebrate.

1136
01:35:42,420 --> 01:35:45,680
Two hoggers have got together,
poor burgers will have to suffer.

1137
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:49,810
Touch your heart say it,
we deserve a party.

1138
01:35:49,890 --> 01:35:51,460
We deserve it, don't we?

1139
01:35:51,540 --> 01:35:54,060
A treat, for Kiran?

1140
01:35:56,340 --> 01:35:57,400
Yes, you deserve it.

1141
01:35:57,480 --> 01:35:59,820
- Yes!
- Yeah!

1142
01:36:30,810 --> 01:36:32,660
"Beat is rocking."

1143
01:36:32,740 --> 01:36:34,330
"Bass is heavy."

1144
01:36:34,410 --> 01:36:36,390
"Youth is crazy."

1145
01:36:36,470 --> 01:36:38,390
"Fast pace."

1146
01:36:38,470 --> 01:36:41,240
"Fast pace."

1147
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:43,740
"Beat is rocking."

1148
01:36:43,820 --> 01:36:45,500
"Bass is heavy."

1149
01:36:45,580 --> 01:36:47,470
"Youth is crazy."

1150
01:36:47,550 --> 01:36:49,270
"Fast pace."

1151
01:36:49,350 --> 01:36:54,850
"There is no stopping us tonight."

1152
01:36:54,930 --> 01:36:59,540
"There is no stopping us tonight."

1153
01:37:00,250 --> 01:37:04,080
"I wish to dance all night."

1154
01:37:04,160 --> 01:37:07,730
"I wish to dance all night."

1155
01:37:07,810 --> 01:37:12,050
"I wish to dance all night."

1156
01:37:26,200 --> 01:37:28,020
"Some draw lines."

1157
01:37:28,100 --> 01:37:29,920
"Some take shots."

1158
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:33,420
"Even in winter, I feel so hot."

1159
01:37:37,160 --> 01:37:38,990
"Some draw lines."

1160
01:37:39,070 --> 01:37:40,930
"Some take shots."

1161
01:37:41,010 --> 01:37:44,490
"Even in winter, I feel so hot."

1162
01:37:44,570 --> 01:37:50,110
"I am intoxicated by
youthfulness that surrounds me."

1163
01:37:50,190 --> 01:37:54,830
"I am intoxicated by
youthfulness that surrounds me."

1164
01:37:55,690 --> 01:37:59,410
"I am in the mood to dance all night."

1165
01:37:59,490 --> 01:38:02,940
"I am in the mood to dance all night."

1166
01:38:03,020 --> 01:38:07,140
"I am in the mood to dance all night."

1167
01:38:21,610 --> 01:38:25,150
"With the wind, your tresses flew.."

1168
01:38:25,230 --> 01:38:28,940
"Don't even seek water,
those bitten by you."

1169
01:38:32,530 --> 01:38:36,370
"With the wind, your tresses flew.."

1170
01:38:36,450 --> 01:38:40,070
"Don't even seek water,
those bitten by you."

1171
01:38:40,150 --> 01:38:45,630
"Your beauty is at its peak."

1172
01:38:45,710 --> 01:38:51,070
"Your beauty is at its peak."

1173
01:38:51,150 --> 01:38:54,750
"I am in the mood to dance all night."

1174
01:38:54,830 --> 01:38:58,270
"I am in the mood to dance all night."

1175
01:38:58,350 --> 01:39:02,660
"I am in the mood to dance all night."

1176
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:20,700
"Your style is mesmerizing."

1177
01:39:20,780 --> 01:39:24,380
"How can anyone not go crazy?"

1178
01:39:28,140 --> 01:39:31,800
"Your style is mesmerizing."

1179
01:39:31,880 --> 01:39:35,560
"How can anyone not go crazy?"

1180
01:39:35,640 --> 01:39:41,050
"She is in a mood to love."

1181
01:39:41,130 --> 01:39:46,470
"She is in a mood to love."

1182
01:39:46,550 --> 01:39:50,040
"I am in the mood to dance all night."

1183
01:39:50,120 --> 01:39:53,920
"I am in the mood to dance all night."

1184
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:57,940
"I am in the mood to dance all night."

1185
01:40:08,290 --> 01:40:11,940
Yes. I have always been like this.

1186
01:40:12,690 --> 01:40:15,910
Okay. When I saw you, I felt that..

1187
01:41:10,940 --> 01:41:13,120
Binder!

1188
01:43:07,970 --> 01:43:09,520
Oh, my God!

1189
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:11,380
It is such a beautiful place.

1190
01:43:11,650 --> 01:43:14,970
I wonder why haven't
I seen this place before..

1191
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:16,930
..in spite of living
in Canada for so many years?

1192
01:43:17,010 --> 01:43:19,640
This is favourite place of Binder.

1193
01:43:20,020 --> 01:43:23,640
Whenever he passes by, he stops here.

1194
01:43:23,720 --> 01:43:26,180
Then he sits here and stares at it.

1195
01:43:26,470 --> 01:43:28,820
It reminds him of the lake
in our village.

1196
01:43:29,290 --> 01:43:34,450
He feels jealous, why isn't the
water in his village lake this clean.

1197
01:43:34,850 --> 01:43:36,740
- Are you kidding me?
- Yeah.

1198
01:43:36,930 --> 01:43:38,640
You know what, Binder?

1199
01:43:38,900 --> 01:43:41,270
When I was running to save my life..

1200
01:43:41,350 --> 01:43:44,970
..I never knew that the person..

1201
01:43:45,580 --> 01:43:48,620
..I will meet would introduce
me to such a beautiful life.

1202
01:43:48,930 --> 01:43:50,890
Life is so beautiful.

1203
01:43:52,810 --> 01:43:55,020
You see life like..

1204
01:43:55,350 --> 01:43:57,100
..your mind shows it to you.

1205
01:43:57,270 --> 01:43:59,420
When you feel sad..

1206
01:44:00,710 --> 01:44:02,560
..then your heart is sad.

1207
01:44:03,310 --> 01:44:05,240
When you feel happy..

1208
01:44:05,470 --> 01:44:09,410
..then life looks
like an arc of colors.

1209
01:44:10,400 --> 01:44:13,430
The arc of colors?
You mean a rainbow?

1210
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:14,530
Right?

1211
01:44:14,740 --> 01:44:16,970
Same thing. Arc, rainbow.

1212
01:44:17,430 --> 01:44:18,400
Or Kiran!

1213
01:44:41,270 --> 01:44:42,650
Oh my god Binder.

1214
01:44:42,770 --> 01:44:44,350
I have come so far.

1215
01:44:44,470 --> 01:44:46,560
But now I am feeling very nervous.

1216
01:44:46,640 --> 01:44:48,100
You were very brave
while spinning your tales.

1217
01:44:48,180 --> 01:44:49,520
Why are you feeling scared now?

1218
01:44:50,390 --> 01:44:51,370
But you know what?

1219
01:44:51,500 --> 01:44:52,870
Do you have another story to tell?

1220
01:44:56,390 --> 01:44:57,240
No.

1221
01:44:57,930 --> 01:45:00,520
Speak your heart out.

1222
01:45:00,600 --> 01:45:03,470
You will neither get to meet Binder
again nor such an opportunity.

1223
01:45:03,770 --> 01:45:05,560
- Shut up, Billi.
- Okay. Okay.

1224
01:45:12,220 --> 01:45:13,270
Stop right there.

1225
01:45:13,550 --> 01:45:15,470
My boyfriend will meet me here.

1226
01:45:16,180 --> 01:45:17,470
Stop. Stop.

1227
01:45:26,770 --> 01:45:27,890
I will miss you.

1228
01:45:28,350 --> 01:45:29,330
Good luck.

1229
01:45:29,680 --> 01:45:30,930
Good luck to you too.

1230
01:45:31,310 --> 01:45:32,550
Bye, Billi.

1231
01:45:32,810 --> 01:45:35,730
Bye, sister-in-law. Miss you too.

1232
01:45:40,060 --> 01:45:40,970
Binder!

1233
01:45:41,890 --> 01:45:44,430
Now that I am leaving,
can I say something?

1234
01:45:45,220 --> 01:45:47,810
If there wasn't a girl in your life..

1235
01:45:48,150 --> 01:45:50,930
And if there wasn't a boy in my life..

1236
01:45:51,310 --> 01:45:55,720
Then there couldn't have
been a boy better than you for me.

1237
01:45:55,810 --> 01:45:58,020
Getting sentimental now? Go.

1238
01:46:04,680 --> 01:46:05,790
Bye!

1239
01:46:12,100 --> 01:46:13,140
Hey!

1240
01:46:15,350 --> 01:46:17,220
- How are you?
- Great.

1241
01:46:17,970 --> 01:46:19,710
I missed you so much.

1242
01:46:25,030 --> 01:46:26,100
Who was he?

1243
01:46:27,020 --> 01:46:28,140
Stranger.

1244
01:46:28,580 --> 01:46:32,610
A complete stranger
who risked even his life..

1245
01:46:32,850 --> 01:46:35,290
..to protect a girl
who took a lift from him.

1246
01:46:35,540 --> 01:46:37,700
Oh, he must really be a great man.

1247
01:46:37,930 --> 01:46:38,720
He is.

1248
01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:41,100
Now do we go to a
hotel or do we go home?

1249
01:46:41,180 --> 01:46:41,970
Wherever.

1250
01:46:42,050 --> 01:46:44,300
But we have to go to the
court first thing tomorrow morning.

1251
01:46:44,380 --> 01:46:46,560
Simmi, do you have
any idea who they are?

1252
01:46:47,100 --> 01:46:48,820
You want to testify
because of Jaz, right?

1253
01:46:48,900 --> 01:46:51,720
She is dead.
But you and I are alive.

1254
01:46:51,810 --> 01:46:53,440
And your life is at risk.

1255
01:46:54,450 --> 01:46:56,850
We have another option instead.

1256
01:46:57,290 --> 01:46:58,560
A bright future.

1257
01:46:58,640 --> 01:47:00,260
End of all the problems.

1258
01:47:01,140 --> 01:47:02,180
How so?

1259
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:04,770
I know some of their men.

1260
01:47:04,910 --> 01:47:06,390
I'll talk to them and ask..

1261
01:47:06,470 --> 01:47:09,930
..whether will they help
us get settled if you don't testify.

1262
01:47:10,180 --> 01:47:12,380
It is a big deal
for us to settle down..

1263
01:47:12,460 --> 01:47:14,470
..but it is a very
small thing for them.

1264
01:47:15,020 --> 01:47:16,210
I hope you understand.

1265
01:47:17,180 --> 01:47:18,270
I understood.

1266
01:47:19,270 --> 01:47:20,390
What did you understand?

1267
01:47:23,100 --> 01:47:25,100
- It's over.
- Over?

1268
01:47:26,090 --> 01:47:27,070
What's over?

1269
01:47:28,060 --> 01:47:30,310
We are over.

1270
01:47:42,140 --> 01:47:45,730
Like you don't want to drink at all?

1271
01:47:49,850 --> 01:47:51,220
Fine.

1272
01:47:51,560 --> 01:47:53,850
You are in Calgary now.

1273
01:47:55,490 --> 01:47:59,720
You have sister-in-law's address.

1274
01:48:00,390 --> 01:48:04,560
That must be giving you enough high.

1275
01:48:06,040 --> 01:48:08,640
I like your love story.

1276
01:48:08,940 --> 01:48:10,770
Awesome. Great.

1277
01:48:11,430 --> 01:48:18,120
And grandfather's story, Mr.
Neek Singh's story..

1278
01:48:18,430 --> 01:48:24,270
What happened with your father..

1279
01:48:24,850 --> 01:48:26,440
..Mr. Nachchattar Singh in '84?

1280
01:48:26,570 --> 01:48:28,270
Who can forget '84?

1281
01:48:31,300 --> 01:48:34,490
The year 1984 was like
hell for all Punjabis.

1282
01:48:34,720 --> 01:48:35,660
Yes.

1283
01:49:07,910 --> 01:49:12,630
Hail to Lord Mahadev!

1284
01:49:13,710 --> 01:49:19,790
Hail to Lord Mahadev!

1285
01:49:22,050 --> 01:49:24,680
I will have to fight with them.

1286
01:49:26,070 --> 01:49:28,810
A Sikh can never run
away from a battlefield.

1287
01:49:31,610 --> 01:49:33,640
I rather embrace death..

1288
01:49:33,720 --> 01:49:35,520
..than run away.

1289
01:49:39,790 --> 01:49:42,010
Bring up my child with a lot of love.

1290
01:49:46,490 --> 01:49:51,390
Hail to Lord Mahadev!

1291
01:49:51,550 --> 01:49:53,880
Hail to Lord Mahadev!

1292
01:49:54,330 --> 01:49:57,480
Hold the steering wheel. Stop here.

1293
01:50:01,060 --> 01:50:02,180
Farewell.

1294
01:50:02,350 --> 01:50:03,340
Goodbye.

1295
01:50:05,640 --> 01:50:07,220
See you in next life.

1296
01:50:31,930 --> 01:50:33,180
Get him!

1297
01:51:08,950 --> 01:51:12,810
Baba, what happened
to those murderers?

1298
01:51:12,890 --> 01:51:14,520
What would happen to them?

1299
01:51:15,490 --> 01:51:17,430
Half of them lived
a good life and died.

1300
01:51:18,970 --> 01:51:22,220
The other half are
old and ready to die.

1301
01:51:28,210 --> 01:51:30,140
The government is
still looking for proof.

1302
01:52:25,930 --> 01:52:26,920
- Yes?
- Hello.

1303
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:28,100
Hi.

1304
01:52:28,520 --> 01:52:29,520
Kiran?

1305
01:52:29,600 --> 01:52:32,020
Kiran isn't at home. Who are you?

1306
01:52:32,100 --> 01:52:34,970
I am her classmate.

1307
01:52:35,350 --> 01:52:36,720
I have come from India.

1308
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:38,940
I thought I should
meet her as I am in Canada.

1309
01:52:39,020 --> 01:52:40,220
I see.

1310
01:52:40,420 --> 01:52:42,270
Kiran has gone to work.

1311
01:52:42,350 --> 01:52:44,770
Okay. Any address?

1312
01:52:50,470 --> 01:52:53,350
Your honor, there is no point
wasting anymore time on this case.

1313
01:52:53,520 --> 01:52:56,520
The only so called witness
is nowhere to be found.

1314
01:52:57,720 --> 01:53:01,100
So that means there
is no witness to this case.

1315
01:53:01,590 --> 01:53:02,740
No, sir.

1316
01:53:02,820 --> 01:53:04,290
There is a witness.

1317
01:53:19,650 --> 01:53:26,640
Judge praised the brave Simmi Sandhu..

1318
01:53:26,720 --> 01:53:30,740
..and questioned the integrity
of the entire police department.

1319
01:53:30,930 --> 01:53:33,430
And he ordered that the
corrupt police officers..

1320
01:53:33,520 --> 01:53:35,520
..should be investigated by the CIA.

1321
01:53:36,100 --> 01:53:39,470
That is Punjab's brave girl,
Simmi Sandhu.

1322
01:53:42,140 --> 01:53:43,520
Simmi! Simmi!

1323
01:53:43,600 --> 01:53:47,970
Didn't you get scared while testifying
against such dangerous people?

1324
01:53:48,060 --> 01:53:50,100
Simmi! Tell me, Simmi.

1325
01:53:50,180 --> 01:53:53,680
Please reply, Simmi. Simmi, Simmi!

1326
01:54:40,770 --> 01:54:41,740
Kiran!

1327
01:54:45,140 --> 01:54:46,520
Binder is here!

1328
01:55:05,850 --> 01:55:11,430
Stupid, it takes a little
time to cross the seven seas.

1329
01:55:11,930 --> 01:55:14,640
I can even cheat death for you.

1330
01:56:04,720 --> 01:56:06,180
I didn't know.

1331
01:56:06,270 --> 01:56:11,140
The worst was when they kept
a dagger around my neck and said..

1332
01:56:11,220 --> 01:56:15,340
..that if I don't agree to get married
to him then they will kill you.

1333
01:56:17,720 --> 01:56:20,600
You turned out to be so weak
in spite of being surrounded..

1334
01:56:21,150 --> 01:56:22,960
..by the strong arms of your love?

1335
01:56:24,220 --> 01:56:28,210
One message from you and
I had put my life on a standstill.

1336
01:56:29,040 --> 01:56:31,840
Only to see that you were helpless?

1337
01:56:33,640 --> 01:56:37,730
You throw me into the sea and ask..

1338
01:56:39,390 --> 01:56:41,990
Binder, do you know how to swim?

1339
01:56:43,750 --> 01:56:45,480
I kept my promise..

1340
01:56:47,820 --> 01:56:49,180
And you?

1341
01:56:49,810 --> 01:56:51,850
And you kept ruining it for me.

1342
01:56:53,600 --> 01:56:55,750
Can your helpless..

1343
01:56:56,680 --> 01:56:59,640
..give me those days back?

1344
01:57:01,180 --> 01:57:03,710
My piece of heaven..

1345
01:57:04,300 --> 01:57:05,930
..you stole it.

1346
01:57:07,820 --> 01:57:12,310
You filled my life
with only dark nights..

1347
01:57:12,930 --> 01:57:15,200
..with no dawn in sight.

1348
01:57:17,210 --> 01:57:20,680
You gifted me with
sorrow of a lifetime.

1349
01:57:22,520 --> 01:57:24,180
Why you did this?

1350
01:57:25,370 --> 01:57:27,890
Kiran! Hey, Kiran!

1351
01:57:28,390 --> 01:57:29,560
Are you done?

1352
01:57:30,770 --> 01:57:31,760
Who is he?

1353
01:57:32,020 --> 01:57:33,770
He is Binder.

1354
01:57:33,850 --> 01:57:35,470
He's from my village.

1355
01:57:35,820 --> 01:57:37,720
We met here coincidently.

1356
01:57:39,270 --> 01:57:40,390
- Let's go.
- Come on.

1357
01:57:40,470 --> 01:57:41,410
Let's go.

1358
01:57:53,930 --> 01:57:55,140
'Coincidently?'

1359
01:57:55,320 --> 01:58:01,840
'Stupid, I loved you so
much that my nature changed.'

1360
01:58:02,960 --> 01:58:08,150
'Otherwise, this meeting
would have ended differently.'

1361
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:14,630
'I had come to take you,
and yet I leave without you.'

1362
01:58:15,060 --> 01:58:18,470
'I was alone before,
and I am alone now as well.'

1363
01:58:22,220 --> 01:58:25,560
"Life is a gamble."

1364
01:58:25,640 --> 01:58:28,520
"I lost the gamble."

1365
01:58:28,600 --> 01:58:31,660
"Pushing me into the storm."

1366
01:58:31,810 --> 01:58:34,670
"You swam ashore."

1367
01:58:34,750 --> 01:58:37,870
"Life is a gamble."

1368
01:58:38,050 --> 01:58:40,810
"I lost the gamble."

1369
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:43,640
"Pushing me into the storm."

1370
01:58:44,140 --> 01:58:46,940
"You swam ashore."

1371
01:58:47,180 --> 01:58:53,200
"I kept singing your
praises even as I drowned."

1372
01:58:56,430 --> 01:58:59,850
"I kept you close to my heart."

1373
01:59:02,560 --> 01:59:05,560
"I kept you close to my heart."

1374
01:59:05,710 --> 01:59:08,330
"And you kept playing with my heart."

1375
01:59:08,550 --> 01:59:11,740
"I kept you close to my heart."

1376
01:59:11,820 --> 01:59:15,600
"And you kept playing with my heart."

1377
01:59:54,850 --> 01:59:57,740
"I am a crazy fool."

1378
01:59:57,980 --> 02:00:01,220
"You are very shrewd and smart."

1379
02:00:01,310 --> 02:00:06,950
"You too no time to forget my love."

1380
02:00:13,560 --> 02:00:16,360
"I am a crazy fool."

1381
02:00:16,620 --> 02:00:19,430
"You are very shrewd and smart."

1382
02:00:19,650 --> 02:00:25,410
"You too no time to forget my love."

1383
02:00:25,560 --> 02:00:28,430
"I gave you my blood."

1384
02:00:28,810 --> 02:00:31,610
"You presented me with poison."

1385
02:00:34,900 --> 02:00:38,330
"I kept you close to my heart."

1386
02:00:41,060 --> 02:00:44,100
"I kept you close to my heart."

1387
02:00:44,180 --> 02:00:47,000
"And you kept playing with my heart."

1388
02:00:47,220 --> 02:00:50,170
"I kept you close to my heart."

1389
02:00:50,250 --> 02:00:53,740
"And you kept playing with my heart."

1390
02:01:11,810 --> 02:01:17,690
"First you broke the oars,
then you pushed me."

1391
02:01:17,830 --> 02:01:23,820
"I had no funeral, my ashes
where submerged into the river."

1392
02:01:30,290 --> 02:01:36,460
"First you broke the oars,
then you pushed me."

1393
02:01:36,540 --> 02:01:42,630
"I had no funeral, my ashes
where submerged into the river."

1394
02:01:42,710 --> 02:01:48,500
"I kept offering you my hand,
but kept letting go of my hand."

1395
02:01:51,810 --> 02:01:56,560
"I kept you close to my heart."

1396
02:01:57,970 --> 02:02:00,930
"I kept you close to my heart."

1397
02:02:01,010 --> 02:02:03,650
"And you kept playing with my heart."

1398
02:02:03,860 --> 02:02:07,140
"I kept you close to my heart."

1399
02:02:07,220 --> 02:02:10,600
"And you kept playing with my heart."

1400
02:02:41,240 --> 02:02:47,310
"If you had taken my hand,
I would have survived the sea."

1401
02:02:47,390 --> 02:02:53,100
"I would have bravely
faced any storm."

1402
02:02:59,850 --> 02:03:05,730
"If you had taken my hand,
I would have survived the sea."

1403
02:03:05,810 --> 02:03:11,600
"I would have bravely
faced any storm."

1404
02:03:11,680 --> 02:03:18,100
"Tell me, for what past
sins am I repenting here?"

1405
02:03:21,060 --> 02:03:24,490
"I kept you close to my heart."

1406
02:03:27,210 --> 02:03:30,200
"I kept you close to my heart."

1407
02:03:30,280 --> 02:03:33,010
"And you kept playing with my heart."

1408
02:03:33,340 --> 02:03:36,380
"I kept you close to my heart."

1409
02:03:36,460 --> 02:03:40,070
"And you kept playing with my heart."

1410
02:03:56,200 --> 02:03:57,100
Hi!

1411
02:03:59,350 --> 02:04:00,390
Hello!

1412
02:04:01,100 --> 02:04:02,060
What's wrong?

1413
02:04:02,220 --> 02:04:03,560
All alone today?

1414
02:04:03,700 --> 02:04:06,180
Yes, Billi is gone for a local round.

1415
02:04:07,490 --> 02:04:09,450
I am talking about Kiran.

1416
02:04:14,060 --> 02:04:18,350
Not all love stories end happily
like Neek Singh's did.

1417
02:04:21,680 --> 02:04:24,680
There are some
which don't meet the right end.

1418
02:04:27,550 --> 02:04:31,270
Kiran's love failed.

1419
02:04:33,770 --> 02:04:35,100
I am sorry, Binder.

1420
02:04:36,160 --> 02:04:37,220
It's okay.

1421
02:04:37,310 --> 02:04:39,220
My heart will cry
and little then calm down.

1422
02:04:39,470 --> 02:04:40,970
Tell me, what happened with you.

1423
02:04:42,720 --> 02:04:43,620
Left.

1424
02:04:44,970 --> 02:04:47,050
He left you or you left him?

1425
02:04:48,060 --> 02:04:49,520
I left him.

1426
02:04:51,060 --> 02:04:52,640
He had no morals.

1427
02:04:53,390 --> 02:04:56,140
So what now, you want someone else?

1428
02:04:58,350 --> 02:04:59,810
Honestly speaking..

1429
02:05:00,210 --> 02:05:03,520
Billi had told me that
this is your favourite place.

1430
02:05:03,720 --> 02:05:06,100
That's why I keep coming here.

1431
02:05:06,270 --> 02:05:09,350
So that I get to meet you, by chance.

1432
02:05:11,670 --> 02:05:14,180
So that I can talk a little with you?

1433
02:05:15,310 --> 02:05:17,310
You don't do little talks.

1434
02:05:19,390 --> 02:05:22,620
In fact, I just have
one thing to say today.

1435
02:05:24,180 --> 02:05:27,520
Perhaps, I didn't feel
it when I was with you.

1436
02:05:27,890 --> 02:05:31,550
But after you kept I many times felt..

1437
02:05:33,350 --> 02:05:36,810
..that I am in love with you.

1438
02:05:40,720 --> 02:05:42,920
Feeling and being
are two different things.

1439
02:05:44,430 --> 02:05:48,350
I too had felt that Kiran
was in love with me.

1440
02:05:51,910 --> 02:05:53,220
Listen to me.

1441
02:05:53,420 --> 02:05:54,430
Bye.

1442
02:05:55,020 --> 02:05:56,100
Binder!

1443
02:06:05,430 --> 02:06:07,350
I have become so
simple because of you.

1444
02:06:07,430 --> 02:06:08,660
I have even stopped
colouring my beard.

1445
02:06:08,740 --> 02:06:10,430
It is good as it is.

1446
02:06:10,790 --> 02:06:11,770
Very good.

1447
02:06:11,850 --> 02:06:13,930
Talking like me, are you now?

1448
02:06:23,350 --> 02:06:26,850
Oh man! She is after you.

1449
02:06:31,390 --> 02:06:33,240
Hi, I am here.

1450
02:06:34,560 --> 02:06:36,350
What are you doing here?

1451
02:06:36,640 --> 02:06:38,520
I wanted to talk to you.

1452
02:06:39,520 --> 02:06:41,270
That day you said that feeling
that you are in love..

1453
02:06:41,350 --> 02:06:42,890
..and being in love
are two different things.

1454
02:06:44,960 --> 02:06:48,810
So now I know, I am in love with you.

1455
02:06:50,100 --> 02:06:51,310
For real.

1456
02:06:52,490 --> 02:06:53,850
It is possible..

1457
02:06:54,640 --> 02:06:58,140
You think so.. I don't.

1458
02:06:59,580 --> 02:07:02,620
Can I say something?
I've explained this earlier as well.

1459
02:07:03,720 --> 02:07:06,460
- It can never be you.
- What?

1460
02:07:07,430 --> 02:07:08,930
What do you mean?

1461
02:07:09,800 --> 02:07:11,470
- Hey Billi.
- Hey, hi.

1462
02:07:11,560 --> 02:07:15,460
Billi, ask him to apologize.
Otherwise, I won't get in the truck.

1463
02:07:19,050 --> 02:07:20,340
Who is asking you to?

1464
02:07:28,410 --> 02:07:31,910
Hey, stop! Stop!

1465
02:07:34,600 --> 02:07:36,270
Hey, please stop!

1466
02:07:38,020 --> 02:07:39,670
Let me get in.

1467
02:07:39,810 --> 02:07:41,640
Fine, I am sorry.

1468
02:07:42,930 --> 02:07:44,780
Please, listen to me.

1469
02:07:46,420 --> 02:07:48,830
Let the beautiful girl in.

1470
02:08:20,060 --> 02:08:22,760
"I had small piece of land,
did whatever I can."

1471
02:08:22,840 --> 02:08:25,510
"I also liked to drive."

1472
02:08:25,590 --> 02:08:28,360
"I also liked to drive."

1473
02:08:28,440 --> 02:08:31,050
"I had small piece of land,
did whatever I can."

1474
02:08:31,130 --> 02:08:33,960
"I also liked to drive."

1475
02:08:34,040 --> 02:08:36,600
"I also liked to drive."

1476
02:08:36,680 --> 02:08:39,230
"I hit the brakes.."

1477
02:08:42,240 --> 02:08:47,770
"I hit the brakes like
it has the engine of a train."

1478
02:08:47,850 --> 02:08:50,600
"I've got a 36-tyred truck."

1479
02:08:50,680 --> 02:08:53,440
"I like to play on the road with."

1480
02:08:53,520 --> 02:08:56,200
"I've got a 36-tyred truck."

1481
02:08:56,280 --> 02:08:59,080
"I like to play on the road with."

1482
02:08:59,160 --> 02:09:02,040
"Like a white boy on a beach.."

1483
02:09:02,120 --> 02:09:04,680
"Like a white boy on a beach.."

1484
02:09:04,760 --> 02:09:10,240
"Like a white boy on a beach
plays with his girlfriend's tresses."

1485
02:09:10,320 --> 02:09:12,960
"I've got a 36-tyred truck."

1486
02:09:13,040 --> 02:09:15,740
"I like to play on the road with."

1487
02:09:15,820 --> 02:09:18,520
"I've got a 36-tyred truck."

1488
02:09:18,600 --> 02:09:21,430
"I like to play on the road with."

1489
02:09:43,640 --> 02:09:49,200
"From middle-east to India.."

1490
02:09:49,280 --> 02:09:52,080
"Then spread across the world.."

1491
02:09:52,160 --> 02:09:54,440
"Many settled in Canada."

1492
02:09:54,520 --> 02:09:57,800
"Many settled in."

1493
02:09:57,880 --> 02:10:03,240
"From middle-east to India.."

1494
02:10:03,320 --> 02:10:05,960
"Then spread across the world.."

1495
02:10:06,040 --> 02:10:08,880
"Many settled in Canada."

1496
02:10:08,960 --> 02:10:11,640
"My Lord, we gypsy Punjabis.."

1497
02:10:11,720 --> 02:10:14,520
"My Lord, we gypsy Punjabis.."

1498
02:10:14,600 --> 02:10:17,200
"My Lord, we gypsy Punjabis.."

1499
02:10:17,280 --> 02:10:20,000
"..know every nook and corner."

1500
02:10:20,080 --> 02:10:22,730
"I've got a 36-tyred truck."

1501
02:10:22,810 --> 02:10:25,480
"I like to play on the road with."

1502
02:10:25,560 --> 02:10:28,440
"Like a white boy on a beach.."
