1
00:00:03,966 --> 00:00:07,891
Based on actual events

2
00:00:27,721 --> 00:00:32,606
When the Moon was Full

3
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,878
Set aside ten lipsticks from
Mecca for me.

4
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:46,633
It has many takers.
Just make sure they’re not old.

5
00:00:46,634 --> 00:00:49,515
- Nothing’s old here. It all goes
fast.
- Give me a discount.

6
00:00:49,933 --> 00:00:53,815
We don’t have discounts on
original items, sorry Mrs.
Mansouri.

7
00:00:54,943 --> 00:01:00,370
- You’re stricter every time I
come back!
- Go get a box from storage.

8
00:01:00,371 --> 00:01:03,626
People usually strike a deal
with their regular customers.

9
00:01:03,627 --> 00:01:05,838
Border agents are stricter.
I don’t have a choice.

10
00:01:05,839 --> 00:01:09,137
- You’ve become strict too.
- Do you want me to play you some
music?

11
00:01:09,138 --> 00:01:13,854
- Finish dealing with me first.
- He went to get them from
storage.

12
00:01:13,855 --> 00:01:16,026
- It’ll take ten minutes.
- How much is this?

13
00:01:16,027 --> 00:01:18,321
You’ve got to be patient.

14
00:01:18,322 --> 00:01:21,202
- You can’t try that on.
- I’ll just draw a line.

15
00:01:21,203 --> 00:01:24,501
- The tip will wear off and no
one will buy it.
- Fine, I’ll take it.

16
00:01:24,502 --> 00:01:28,843
- It’s just that no one will buy
it.
- I’ll take it.

17
00:01:37,987 --> 00:01:40,408
I sold all the L’Oreal hair
dyes.

18
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:42,580
But you don’t have all the
colors...

19
00:01:45,711 --> 00:01:48,382
Was the lightest one a N-10?

20
00:01:52,808 --> 00:01:55,230
What was the lightest one?

21
00:01:59,029 --> 00:02:02,661
Do you have nail polish too?

22
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:19,111
- Is that your daughter?
- What?

23
00:02:25,456 --> 00:02:27,711
What do you want with her,
bastard?!

24
00:02:49,296 --> 00:02:52,761
Elnaz Shakerdoost

25
00:02:53,137 --> 00:02:56,060
Hootan Shakiba

26
00:02:57,771 --> 00:03:01,195
Fereshteh Sadre Orafaee

27
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:05,954
Pedram Sharifi

28
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:09,629
Amin Miri

29
00:03:10,088 --> 00:03:13,094
Banipal Shoomoon

30
00:03:14,555 --> 00:03:17,603
with: Shabnam Maghdami

31
00:03:19,314 --> 00:03:21,736
and Farid Sajadi Hosseini

32
00:03:24,617 --> 00:03:27,623
introducing: Armin Rahimian

33
00:03:32,758 --> 00:03:36,808
A film by Narges Abyar

34
00:03:39,521 --> 00:03:43,196
Tehran, 2002

35
00:04:04,613 --> 00:04:08,954
Hi. Welcome.
Sorry I’m late, I was training.

36
00:04:08,955 --> 00:04:10,249
How are you?

37
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,463
So one year of talking on
the phone finally paid off?!

38
00:04:13,464 --> 00:04:14,089
Yes.

39
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:15,969
Welcome, welcome.
Excuse me.

40
00:04:18,432 --> 00:04:21,021
I brought this for Faezeh.

41
00:04:21,313 --> 00:04:23,859
- Thank you.
- It’s nothing.

42
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:27,617
“My solemn gaze roved
over your innocent face,

43
00:04:28,411 --> 00:04:32,585
it shifted away in shame,
seeking your affection.”

44
00:04:33,045 --> 00:04:38,388
I wrote the poem myself and
had a friend carve it in wood.

45
00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:39,766
- Thank you.
- You’re welcome.

46
00:04:39,767 --> 00:04:43,816
- Wonderful! You’re a poet too?
- It’s just a hobby.

47
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:48,074
I went through something too
and said a few lines like,

48
00:04:48,075 --> 00:04:51,832
-“You said I love you, I said it
soothes your pain...
- Yes.

49
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:56,424
-“I said I’m broke, she said
what a useless bloke!”
-Shahaab, let us talk.

50
00:04:56,425 --> 00:04:59,472
- We were talking about poetry...
- Your siblings didn’t come?

51
00:04:59,473 --> 00:05:03,438
I would’ve had to rent a bus
there’s so many of them!

52
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:06,027
- An army from here to there!
- Bless the lord.

53
00:05:06,278 --> 00:05:08,281
- I don’t know what to say...
- Go ahead.

54
00:05:08,282 --> 00:05:10,201
I don’t know how it happened.

55
00:05:10,202 --> 00:05:12,790
I can’t marry off my daughter
faraway.

56
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:16,882
I only have this one daughter.
It’s hard, we’re from different
cultures.

57
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:19,971
- My daughter was raised in
Tehran...
- Don’t worry. She’ll get used to it.

58
00:05:19,972 --> 00:05:23,102
- There are many Tehrani brides
there.
- No, it’s just that...

59
00:05:23,103 --> 00:05:24,898
I’m a merchant.

60
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:28,155
I take things to Pakistan, and
bring things back for
Abdol-Hamid’s store.

61
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:31,536
My sister Ghamnaz has done
a lot for her children.

62
00:05:31,537 --> 00:05:33,623
We’re worried about
the distance too.

63
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:37,047
But they want each other.
What can we do?

64
00:05:37,048 --> 00:05:39,468
Abdol-Hamid’s driving us crazy!

65
00:05:39,469 --> 00:05:43,685
They’ve been talking to each
other for a year
and Abdol-Hamid comes to Tehran to see her.

66
00:05:43,686 --> 00:05:47,484
- Do you want them to elope?!
- It’ll be like in Swan Song.

67
00:05:47,485 --> 00:05:50,909
- God forbid!
- Remember the film Swan Song?

68
00:05:51,493 --> 00:05:53,705
Faezeh made that.

69
00:05:53,706 --> 00:05:57,003
All these doilies, the one on
the TV,

70
00:05:57,004 --> 00:06:01,178
the one on the wall, the
cushions,
it’s all made by Faezeh.

71
00:06:01,179 --> 00:06:04,768
- Wonderful!
- My daughter is very talented.

72
00:06:04,769 --> 00:06:06,063
Very nice!

73
00:06:06,064 --> 00:06:09,069
- I don’t know what to say...
- Go ahead.

74
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:13,495
We don’t have any cases
of divorce in our family.

75
00:06:13,496 --> 00:06:17,669
It’s not nice speaking about
divorce
when you’re here to ask for her hand,

76
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:21,636
we believe a girl should marry
in white,
and return in a white shroud...

77
00:06:21,637 --> 00:06:25,728
We don’t believe in divorce
either.
The prophet says,

78
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:28,358
“The most hateful thing to Allah
is divorce.”

79
00:06:28,359 --> 00:06:29,443
- Sir?
- Yes?

80
00:06:29,444 --> 00:06:32,950
Every time someone’s come
to ask for her hand,

81
00:06:32,951 --> 00:06:35,414
I’ve said she can’t leave my
side.

82
00:06:35,415 --> 00:06:39,380
At the most, they can get
a house at the end of the
street.

83
00:06:39,381 --> 00:06:40,298
Yes.

84
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:43,972
When their father passed away,
may God rest his soul,

85
00:06:43,973 --> 00:06:47,939
I went through great hardships
to raise them.

86
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:51,821
Until Mousa came into our lives
and took on their
responsibility.

87
00:06:51,822 --> 00:06:56,246
I have always said God sent him
to us.

88
00:06:56,247 --> 00:07:01,131
- He’s been a true father to
them...
- God bless you.

89
00:07:01,132 --> 00:07:04,763
- There’s something else I need
to say.
- Go ahead.

90
00:07:04,764 --> 00:07:08,020
My daughter has a birth defect,
it’s her foot.

91
00:07:08,021 --> 00:07:12,571
Hamid knows, but you should know
too,
because we have nothing to hide...

92
00:07:12,572 --> 00:07:15,745
- That’s okay.
- But she has beautiful eyes.

93
00:07:16,162 --> 00:07:20,044
- Shahaab dear!
- Don’t mention her defect
without her strengths.

94
00:07:20,045 --> 00:07:22,841
Congratulations!
Congratulations!

95
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:25,431
His mom won’t say a word!

96
00:07:27,393 --> 00:07:29,981
- Girl?
- Yes.

97
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:31,986
I want to wash up.

98
00:07:33,739 --> 00:07:36,161
It’s the second door to the
right.

99
00:07:41,588 --> 00:07:43,133
My son is no good for you.

100
00:08:11,064 --> 00:08:12,066
Mom!

101
00:08:12,609 --> 00:08:13,777
Mom!

102
00:08:14,738 --> 00:08:16,617
- Yes?
- What did you tell Faezeh?

103
00:08:18,161 --> 00:08:22,211
Do you want to crush me?
Why did you tell her about
Abdol-Vahab?

104
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,509
Why not?
You don’t have a sister.

105
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:28,765
If you did, I’d thank the person
who’s honest with me.

106
00:08:28,766 --> 00:08:31,687
When she finds out
your eldest brother was killed,

107
00:08:31,688 --> 00:08:34,277
won’t she wonder why we didn’t
tell her?

108
00:08:35,404 --> 00:08:38,285
She’ll never forgive you then.

109
00:08:38,702 --> 00:08:43,253
- What did she say when you told
her?
- Nothing. You’ve stolen her heart!

110
00:08:43,587 --> 00:08:45,841
Mom, look at me.

111
00:08:46,134 --> 00:08:50,016
If this girl doesn’t work out,
I will runaway and get lost.

112
00:08:52,188 --> 00:08:55,527
Zahedan, 3 months later

113
00:08:56,321 --> 00:08:59,201
Buy some lace for
the ceremony in Tehran,

114
00:08:59,202 --> 00:09:03,794
but wear one of these
for the ceremony here.

115
00:09:04,796 --> 00:09:07,301
- How much is it?
- This one?

116
00:09:08,721 --> 00:09:10,557
This is better...

117
00:09:11,434 --> 00:09:15,524
When it’s made into
a dress you’ll look so
beautiful!

118
00:09:15,525 --> 00:09:17,154
I’ll write you a song.

119
00:09:18,616 --> 00:09:19,618
Cover your hair...

120
00:09:22,749 --> 00:09:24,210
Look at that cat.

121
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:28,134
That’s me, singing for you.

122
00:09:28,135 --> 00:09:29,929
- Should I get it for you?
- No thanks.

123
00:09:31,683 --> 00:09:32,685
Hello?

124
00:09:37,695 --> 00:09:39,114
I’ll be right there.

125
00:09:54,646 --> 00:09:58,945
- Who’s that?
- His younger brother,
Abdol-Majid.

126
00:09:58,946 --> 00:10:03,914
- Should we go say hello?
- No, forget about him.

127
00:10:06,043 --> 00:10:09,091
Why don’t you understand?
It’s below us...

128
00:10:09,592 --> 00:10:11,679
Below us?!

129
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,897
- They’ve agreed. She’ll be my
wife.
- Abdol-Hamid! Abdol-Hamid!

130
00:10:16,898 --> 00:10:19,903
She’s the most important thing
in the world to me.

131
00:10:19,904 --> 00:10:23,328
If you insult her, you’ve
insulted me.
Do you understand?!

132
00:10:24,205 --> 00:10:25,539
You’ve lost the path.

133
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:28,128
“You, who are so proud of your
name,
if you are not in love, then shame”.

134
00:10:28,129 --> 00:10:31,802
- Get lost.
- When you began playing music,

135
00:10:31,803 --> 00:10:36,270
when you started selling makeup,
I thought you’d become vain,

136
00:10:36,271 --> 00:10:40,403
but I didn’t think you’d sell
your
religion too, for a woman, for the world.

137
00:10:40,404 --> 00:10:42,824
Do you think you’re God’s
only pure creature?

138
00:10:42,825 --> 00:10:46,080
That everyone else is bad and
filthy, but you’re good...

139
00:10:46,081 --> 00:10:50,549
I don’t want to waste my time
arguing.

140
00:10:51,008 --> 00:10:54,056
- I’m saying this for your own
good...
- Yeah, right...

141
00:10:54,348 --> 00:10:57,020
- Love is fleeting...
- Fine.

142
00:10:57,228 --> 00:11:00,944
It lasts six months.
Then you begin to see her
faults.

143
00:11:00,945 --> 00:11:05,328
Especially this one!
She’s not married yet and wears
makeup!

144
00:11:05,329 --> 00:11:07,332
You have no right insulting her.

145
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,921
Don’t mention my wife.
You’re the filthy one...

146
00:11:18,313 --> 00:11:21,276
I got this for you.
Why was it in Shahaab’s room?

147
00:11:21,277 --> 00:11:24,032
I didn’t give it to him.
He borrowed it.

148
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:28,416
Faezeh shut the door.

149
00:11:29,585 --> 00:11:32,424
Take off your scarf.
I wanna see your hair.

150
00:11:32,884 --> 00:11:33,884
Why not?

151
00:11:35,221 --> 00:11:37,684
- Let’s get married first.
- I really want to see your hair.

152
00:11:38,102 --> 00:11:41,232
My mom says it’s long and curly.

153
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:44,114
Like a waterfall.
Really?

154
00:11:44,657 --> 00:11:48,373
How wonderful!
I’m so lucky!

155
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,421
Have you washed the tomatoes?

156
00:11:52,548 --> 00:11:55,178
Faezeh where do you belong?
Where?

157
00:11:55,429 --> 00:11:57,892
- What do you mean?
- You belong right here.

158
00:12:00,689 --> 00:12:02,985
-Where?
-Congratulations!
Congratulations!

159
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:27,575
- Do you want some help?
- Don’t follow everywhere I go.

160
00:12:27,576 --> 00:12:30,163
- Everyone’s looking!
- So what?

161
00:12:30,164 --> 00:12:32,334
It’s not like I’m stealing.
You’re my wife.

162
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:35,257
I’m gonna stay right here,
let them say what they will.

163
00:12:35,258 --> 00:12:36,511
- Go inside.
- Give it to me.

164
00:12:37,763 --> 00:12:38,932
Go inside!

165
00:12:43,608 --> 00:12:44,944
I’ll soak you!

166
00:12:53,836 --> 00:12:56,383
You’ll catch a cold
on your wedding night!

167
00:13:01,477 --> 00:13:03,481
You made me wet?!

168
00:13:04,775 --> 00:13:07,697
Stop that! Hamid!

169
00:13:07,698 --> 00:13:09,909
What’re you doing?

170
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:12,790
- Get up!
- She started it.

171
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:15,629
You shouldn’t do it.
Be the adult.

172
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:17,926
Take this.

173
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:21,057
Dry your shirt.
Go behind the wall.

174
00:13:21,058 --> 00:13:25,065
You’re gonna be bride and groom!

175
00:13:25,066 --> 00:13:26,861
- Go behind the wall.
- Sorry!

176
00:13:32,873 --> 00:13:35,003
I almost choked!

177
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:43,811
“Love sometimes turns into your
hue,

178
00:13:44,647 --> 00:13:46,901
bringing the moments of life in
view”.

179
00:13:48,362 --> 00:13:52,663
- Like it?
- Did you just make that up?

180
00:13:58,675 --> 00:14:00,011
What eyes you have!

181
00:14:03,392 --> 00:14:05,021
They’re like dogs.

182
00:14:07,192 --> 00:14:10,031
- What does that mean?
- They’re like dogs.

183
00:14:11,491 --> 00:14:16,042
They’ve grabbed hold
of my heels and won’t let go.

184
00:14:16,043 --> 00:14:18,421
Like that day at the store.

185
00:14:18,422 --> 00:14:21,804
You grabbed hold of me
and drove me crazy...

186
00:14:23,641 --> 00:14:26,564
- You’ve got a cellphone?
- Saved by the bell!

187
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:30,404
Hello?

188
00:14:30,822 --> 00:14:31,990
It’s your mom.

189
00:14:31,991 --> 00:14:35,164
How are you?

190
00:14:35,707 --> 00:14:37,460
How’s Mr. Noureddin?

191
00:14:42,011 --> 00:14:43,723
You haven’t left yet?

192
00:16:02,505 --> 00:16:05,427
I know him.
He’s a shopkeeper.

193
00:16:05,428 --> 00:16:06,806
We know.

194
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:10,563
- We realize it’s a bad time.
- Mousa?

195
00:16:12,442 --> 00:16:14,947
- What’s going on?
- They want to talk to Hamid.

196
00:16:15,239 --> 00:16:18,537
- I’ll be right down.
- His wife will be right down.

197
00:16:27,889 --> 00:16:29,559
- Hello.
- Hello.

198
00:16:30,269 --> 00:16:31,687
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

199
00:16:31,688 --> 00:16:34,819
- I am Ahmad Abdollahi.
- They want to see Hamid.

200
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:37,241
We know it’s not a good time.
We didn’t realize.

201
00:16:37,658 --> 00:16:44,129
- We need to ask some questions.
- They were only married a few
hours ago.

202
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:45,716
It’s an emergency.

203
00:16:46,134 --> 00:16:49,306
- Ms. Mansouri, ask him to come
down.
- How do you know me?

204
00:16:49,307 --> 00:16:52,437
Tell him we just have a few
questions
about Abdol-Malek.

205
00:16:52,438 --> 00:16:56,195
- Who’s Abdol-Malek?
- He knows.

206
00:16:58,785 --> 00:17:01,079
Abdol-Vahed, go inside.

207
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,583
Go dear!

208
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:24,626
I will help however I can.

209
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:28,593
- Congratulations on your
wedding.
- Thanks.

210
00:17:28,594 --> 00:17:32,101
- Congratulations Ma’am.
- Thank you.

211
00:17:32,685 --> 00:17:36,609
And about the other thing...

212
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:40,409
That issue has nothing to do
with him.
We just wanted to see if he could help.

213
00:17:41,912 --> 00:17:43,540
Thank you.

214
00:17:54,186 --> 00:17:57,859
Tell me what’s going
on with your family!

215
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:01,743
- Please tell me the truth...
- I told you everything.

216
00:18:02,077 --> 00:18:04,623
I am honest with you.

217
00:18:04,624 --> 00:18:06,879
Have I ever lied to you?

218
00:18:07,212 --> 00:18:09,299
It’s my family. What can I do?

219
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,848
- They weren’t like this, but
they changed.
- I have to know what’s going on.

220
00:18:13,434 --> 00:18:15,645
- You’re brother’s called
Abdol-Malek?
- Don’t ask...

221
00:18:15,646 --> 00:18:17,566
- He ran off to Pakistan?
- Don’t ask me...

222
00:18:17,567 --> 00:18:21,114
- Why?
- They told me in there not to
say anything.

223
00:18:21,115 --> 00:18:23,704
Otherwise I’d tell you.
Believe me.

224
00:18:24,371 --> 00:18:26,375
If you don’t trust me I won’t
insist.

225
00:18:26,668 --> 00:18:30,091
But if you want me the way I am,
I’ll do everything for you.

226
00:18:30,092 --> 00:18:31,553
Otherwise I’ll leave.

227
00:18:33,223 --> 00:18:35,227
It’s not too late to separate.

228
00:18:41,823 --> 00:18:43,118
Faezeh...

229
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,128
get in.

230
00:19:00,027 --> 00:19:01,571
It’s delicious.
Have some.

231
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:08,043
These dresses...

232
00:19:10,213 --> 00:19:12,009
No thanks.
I don’t want any.

233
00:19:23,114 --> 00:19:24,742
- Hello.
- Come in please.

234
00:19:25,285 --> 00:19:26,871
How are you?

235
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:31,089
So you are Moones.
See what we brought you.

236
00:19:33,468 --> 00:19:35,764
We thought you’d
probably bought a walker,

237
00:19:36,641 --> 00:19:39,730
we brought one in case
someone could use it.

238
00:19:39,731 --> 00:19:42,236
My mother-in-law sent one of
them.

239
00:19:42,653 --> 00:19:44,657
Thank you.

240
00:19:45,075 --> 00:19:48,330
We are alone and poor.
The kids made these.

241
00:19:48,331 --> 00:19:50,085
See if this fits her.

242
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:53,383
It’s beautiful.

243
00:19:54,135 --> 00:19:55,887
How pretty you look!

244
00:19:55,888 --> 00:19:59,979
- How are you?
- My legs hurt.

245
00:20:00,438 --> 00:20:02,442
God bless you.

246
00:20:03,444 --> 00:20:04,614
Do you like your dress?

247
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:13,130
Uncle stop! Stop!

248
00:20:13,131 --> 00:20:14,634
Stop that!

249
00:20:17,556 --> 00:20:21,980
- You are our guest.
- We don’t want you to kill it
for us!

250
00:20:21,981 --> 00:20:24,696
But you’re our guest.

251
00:20:27,201 --> 00:20:29,997
They have one goat
and want to cook it for us!

252
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:34,209
- Are you two sisters?
- How could you tell?

253
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:37,882
You look alike.
That one’s Preity Zinta’s
choice.

254
00:21:37,883 --> 00:21:39,427
- Who?
- Can I have a tissue?

255
00:21:39,428 --> 00:21:41,932
- Preity Zinta. You don’t know
her?
- No.

256
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:44,938
She was in that film with the
guy.

257
00:21:44,939 --> 00:21:49,489
What was the name of the film
where they fall in love in
school?

258
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:52,077
- “Heart”! Have you seen it?
- No.

259
00:21:52,078 --> 00:21:56,086
You’ll laugh for half the film,
and cry at the end.

260
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:59,927
- Do you watch a lot of movies?
- Yes. It’s my job.

261
00:22:00,262 --> 00:22:02,390
Don’t look at me here.

262
00:22:02,391 --> 00:22:05,313
- I’m into arts. Art, cinema,
camera...
- Hello?

263
00:22:05,898 --> 00:22:08,568
Yes?
How are you?

264
00:22:08,569 --> 00:22:10,572
Do you work in television?

265
00:22:10,573 --> 00:22:14,038
Really?
I’ll be right there!

266
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:16,042
I want to save cinema...

267
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:19,341
- Shahaab, close up!
- Why?

268
00:22:19,633 --> 00:22:21,344
- You’re an uncle!
- What?

269
00:22:21,345 --> 00:22:23,809
- You’re an uncle!
- Really?

270
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:28,401
Thanks ladies!
Excuse me, I didn’t get you
name...

271
00:22:29,235 --> 00:22:33,117
- I’m Golnaz.
- I’m Shahaab. Ask for me when
you call.

272
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:36,249
- But we want to shop...
- Ladies, cut, straight to
maternity.

273
00:22:51,906 --> 00:22:53,742
- His name’s Saeed?
- Yes.

274
00:22:53,743 --> 00:22:57,207
It’s nice. But if you name him
Amir, Shahrokh, Salman,

275
00:22:57,208 --> 00:22:59,504
when he grows up you can call
him
Amir Khan, Shahrokh Khan, Salman Khan...

276
00:22:59,505 --> 00:23:05,725
- It’s out of my hands. She’s the
boss.
- He’ll be Saeed Khan! It’s gangster!

277
00:23:06,143 --> 00:23:09,148
I wanted my mom to see the baby.

278
00:23:09,149 --> 00:23:15,452
- I haven’t been back home for a
year-and-a-half.
- Don’t give me a guilt trip!

279
00:23:15,453 --> 00:23:18,292
I didn’t say you couldn’t go.
I just want my daughter to be
around.

280
00:23:18,709 --> 00:23:22,841
You can come and go as you
please.
Faezeh should go too.

281
00:23:22,842 --> 00:23:25,306
After all it’s your mom.

282
00:23:33,531 --> 00:23:37,120
- You’ve turned into a man.
- Hi. How are you?

283
00:23:37,121 --> 00:23:41,004
Hello mom.
Hi Ghamnaz,

284
00:23:41,547 --> 00:23:43,800
- hello Noureddin. How are you?
- Hello.

285
00:23:43,801 --> 00:23:47,308
I can smell the wood oven!
You’ve made bread.

286
00:23:49,438 --> 00:23:52,485
- How are you?
- Thank God. How about you?

287
00:23:52,486 --> 00:23:55,074
- Good. And you uncle?
- How are you?

288
00:23:56,494 --> 00:24:01,044
- You didn’t come to Tehran!
- Hello bride.

289
00:24:06,639 --> 00:24:08,977
Hamid, what did you do to
your traditional clothes?

290
00:24:09,686 --> 00:24:10,980
Lose them?

291
00:24:10,981 --> 00:24:13,402
Why didn’t you get a crew-cut?

292
00:24:14,738 --> 00:24:16,951
Here, take some silverware
townie!

293
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:21,417
You’re an uncle now.

294
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:23,005
Behave yourself!

295
00:24:24,675 --> 00:24:28,431
What’re they saying?
Tell me?

296
00:24:28,432 --> 00:24:31,771
Behave yourselves.
We have a guest.

297
00:24:31,772 --> 00:24:34,443
- Drink daughter.
- Thank you.

298
00:24:34,444 --> 00:24:37,365
This is for Abdol-Sattar.
Will you give it to him?

299
00:24:37,366 --> 00:24:39,955
- Thank you.
- You don’t deserve it!

300
00:24:40,372 --> 00:24:43,920
- This is for Abdol-Vahed.
- Keep the wrapping paper.

301
00:24:43,921 --> 00:24:47,803
This is for you Ghamnaz.
I looked all over for it.

302
00:24:47,804 --> 00:24:50,559
- Thank you.
- This is for you uncle.

303
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:53,397
It’s praying beads,
good for everything.

304
00:24:53,398 --> 00:24:56,403
For your health,
kidneys, liver, everything.

305
00:24:56,404 --> 00:25:00,788
- Yes. Thank you very much.
- You’re welcome.

306
00:25:06,216 --> 00:25:08,554
Thanks so much.

307
00:25:09,347 --> 00:25:11,935
It’s beautiful mom.
Thank you.

308
00:25:12,854 --> 00:25:18,574
Try it on and if it doesn’t fit
I will exchange it.

309
00:25:19,576 --> 00:25:21,871
This is for Abdol-Majid.

310
00:25:21,872 --> 00:25:25,880
Excuse me,
this one’s for Abdol-Majid.

311
00:25:26,173 --> 00:25:31,349
Hopefully he’ll repent and come
back.
And this is for Abdol-Ghafoor.

312
00:25:31,809 --> 00:25:33,604
He’s not here.

313
00:26:56,102 --> 00:26:57,605
Uncle! Uncle!

314
00:26:57,856 --> 00:26:59,985
They’ve brought
Abdol-Ghafoor in handcuffs!

315
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:20,818
What’s going on?

316
00:27:22,906 --> 00:27:24,826
Why won’t you answer?

317
00:27:26,538 --> 00:27:29,252
- Abdol-Ghafoor what have you
done?
- What’s going on?

318
00:27:30,003 --> 00:27:31,630
- I’ll tell you.
- Why’ve you arrested him?

319
00:27:31,631 --> 00:27:33,510
- I’ll tell you.
- What’s he done?

320
00:27:35,096 --> 00:27:38,144
What the hell have you done?!

321
00:27:40,065 --> 00:27:41,358
Calm down.

322
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:44,907
You won’t let me live
in peace with my family!

323
00:27:44,908 --> 00:27:48,874
- Calm down!
- I’ve had it with you all!

324
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:54,093
- You were supposed to inform us.
- Do you have a warrant to come
in?!

325
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:57,808
- Did you forget our deal?
- What’s he done?

326
00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:01,817
- Stockpiled money and weapons.
- What money? What weapons?

327
00:28:02,443 --> 00:28:04,154
Where is it?

328
00:28:04,739 --> 00:28:07,035
There and there.

329
00:28:08,413 --> 00:28:09,749
It’s okay.

330
00:28:24,821 --> 00:28:25,821
Move over.

331
00:28:28,829 --> 00:28:30,081
Higher, higher...

332
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:56,634
Lower it.

333
00:29:37,382 --> 00:29:39,011
That’s good. Slower, slower.

334
00:29:52,871 --> 00:29:56,629
Don’t cry sweetheart.

335
00:30:10,574 --> 00:30:11,576
Faezeh dear?

336
00:30:14,582 --> 00:30:15,709
Faezeh?

337
00:30:19,675 --> 00:30:22,388
- Faezeh dear?
- Let’s leave right now!

338
00:30:22,389 --> 00:30:25,895
- Right now!
- I swear I didn’t know anything.

339
00:30:25,896 --> 00:30:28,901
- Please don’t say anything to
your family.
- Who are these people?!

340
00:30:28,902 --> 00:30:32,199
- Why are all these weapons in
your house?
- Calm down!

341
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,665
- What’s your family into?
- For the sake of the child.

342
00:30:35,666 --> 00:30:39,380
What I’ve done to deserve this!

343
00:30:39,381 --> 00:30:44,015
You haven’t done anything!
You don’t deserve to be hurt by
my family.

344
00:30:44,016 --> 00:30:49,483
It’s my brother who’s hidden
all these weapons in his yard!

345
00:30:49,484 --> 00:30:53,993
- It has nothing to do with us!
- I don’t know what’ll happen!

346
00:30:54,328 --> 00:30:56,583
I’m worried!

347
00:30:58,837 --> 00:31:01,007
Abdol-Majid called.

348
00:31:02,052 --> 00:31:05,558
He didn’t say anything.
He didn’t say where he was.

349
00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:08,438
- Why didn’t you tell the
agents?!
- It was 18 months ago! What could I say?

350
00:31:08,439 --> 00:31:12,279
- You were supposed to inform
them.
- To get myself in trouble?

351
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:15,160
I didn’t know anything.

352
00:31:15,161 --> 00:31:19,543
- I’m not a rat. I can’t sellout
my own brother.
- So what did he say?

353
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:22,424
- Just asked how you were?
- He asked me to send the family
to Pakistan.

354
00:31:22,425 --> 00:31:26,643
- What did you tell him?
- I didn’t agree. I said he was
only trouble.

355
00:31:27,895 --> 00:31:30,859
But now with the situation here,
I think I have to send them.

356
00:31:33,657 --> 00:31:35,492
What about us?

357
00:31:35,493 --> 00:31:39,041
- Sooner or later they’ll come
after us.
- What’s it got to do with us?

358
00:31:39,042 --> 00:31:42,214
-Our life’s got nothing to do
with Abdol-Majid.
-One of your brother’s is dead,

359
00:31:42,215 --> 00:31:48,853
the other ran off to Pakistan,
and
this one’s been arrested for hiding weapons!

360
00:31:49,438 --> 00:31:52,609
You can rest assured your
brother’s troubles will engulf
us too!

361
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:54,448
What do you want me to do?!

362
00:31:55,826 --> 00:31:57,454
I don’t know!

363
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:03,841
We need to leave Iran.

364
00:32:03,842 --> 00:32:07,390
The agent said we have to get
away
from Abdol-Majid if we like our life.

365
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:11,106
Abdol-Hamid, they want you
outside.

366
00:32:19,414 --> 00:32:23,129
Bride, I told you not to come
here.

367
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:26,220
I didn’t want you to come here
for the birth of the child.

368
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:29,309
I would’ve sent you your gift.

369
00:32:30,854 --> 00:32:34,485
Don’t come back if you like your
life.

370
00:32:34,486 --> 00:32:36,783
Do you have anything else to
say?!

371
00:32:43,546 --> 00:32:47,093
I apologize.
They’re celebrating the new
office.

372
00:32:47,094 --> 00:32:48,848
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

373
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:53,524
We want to immigrate abroad...

374
00:32:53,858 --> 00:32:55,236
- To Europe.
- To Europe.

375
00:33:00,162 --> 00:33:03,167
We came here to use your
expertise.

376
00:33:03,168 --> 00:33:07,426
We know many people there,
from Baluchistan and Pakistan.

377
00:33:07,427 --> 00:33:09,597
Many of our relatives have gone
to England.

378
00:33:09,598 --> 00:33:13,646
My wife just mentioned
they are doing well there...

379
00:33:13,647 --> 00:33:16,069
Listen, it’s different from
Pakistan.

380
00:33:16,403 --> 00:33:22,290
It’s difficult, you need money,
and it’s unpredictable.

381
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,922
Do you know any English?

382
00:33:27,926 --> 00:33:31,349
- No... a little bit.
- That’s bad.

383
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:36,359
- England has the toughest asylum
laws.
- What if we apply from the UAE, from Dubai?

384
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,613
It’s no different from Iran.
It’s still close by

385
00:33:38,614 --> 00:33:40,993
and your family can show up.

386
00:33:40,994 --> 00:33:43,456
Sir, we are different from the
others.

387
00:33:43,457 --> 00:33:47,381
One of his brothers has been
killed,
one has run away to Pakistan,

388
00:33:47,382 --> 00:33:49,887
and the other is awaiting
execution in prison.

389
00:33:50,305 --> 00:33:53,143
We are in a dangerous situation.

390
00:33:53,602 --> 00:33:58,946
We’re not makin
it up just to go abroad.

391
00:33:58,947 --> 00:34:00,157
I’m afraid.

392
00:34:04,458 --> 00:34:06,127
I’m afraid for my family.

393
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:09,258
We want to go
somewhere no one can reach us.

394
00:34:09,759 --> 00:34:12,514
- Which UN office do you want to
apply from?
- Pakistan.

395
00:34:12,515 --> 00:34:15,228
Not Pakistan.
You wanna go straight to your
brothers?

396
00:34:15,229 --> 00:34:17,358
- Then where?
- No way.

397
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:20,238
I know people there.
I don’t know anyone in Europe.

398
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:22,953
Listen, given what you’ve told
me

399
00:34:23,662 --> 00:34:25,666
I think you should apply from
Pakistan.

400
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,843
Want some yoghurt?

401
00:34:34,476 --> 00:34:38,650
- Is that all you’re eating.
- Mom stop giving me a hard time.

402
00:34:38,651 --> 00:34:43,075
- He wants to watch his figure.
- What’re you talking about?

403
00:34:43,076 --> 00:34:46,749
A boy as tall as you needs
to eat until his jaw goes stiff.

404
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:50,507
- You’ve got to eat like a hog.
- Then I won’t have a six-pack
anymore.

405
00:34:50,508 --> 00:34:52,679
- A what?
- Six-pack.

406
00:34:56,061 --> 00:34:58,355
You need an asset to make money.

407
00:34:58,356 --> 00:35:00,695
It’s not working out like this.

408
00:35:01,237 --> 00:35:05,455
As soon as I start making some
money
and getting established, I’ve got to move.

409
00:35:05,871 --> 00:35:10,005
I need to talk to my mom to
give me my share of the house.

410
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:14,974
I’m going to Pakistan to see
if my uncle will allow it or
not.

411
00:35:21,695 --> 00:35:24,952
How was that?
I brought up the subject.

412
00:35:25,661 --> 00:35:29,377
- My mom’s very smart.
- I didn’t want to lie to her. I
had to do it.

413
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:32,132
What excuse could
I give for going to Pakistan?

414
00:35:32,133 --> 00:35:34,972
- We’ve got to change our SIM
cards.
- What for?

415
00:35:35,264 --> 00:35:37,017
It might be hacked.

416
00:35:37,018 --> 00:35:40,733
If they learn we’re leaving Iran
or going
to Pakistan we may get into trouble.

417
00:35:41,735 --> 00:35:45,492
She won’t believe you’re going
to Pakistan for your uncle’s
permission.

418
00:35:45,493 --> 00:35:48,414
I’m worried
about you crossing the border!

419
00:35:48,415 --> 00:35:50,752
It’s dangerous!
I’m nervous!

420
00:35:50,753 --> 00:35:55,386
- I was born on the border!
- Stop joking!

421
00:35:55,387 --> 00:35:58,143
Do you want me to stay?
I’ll do whatever you say.

422
00:35:59,145 --> 00:36:01,650
Leave that and come here.

423
00:36:05,866 --> 00:36:08,997
Do you know how difficult it is
for me to part from you?

424
00:36:10,167 --> 00:36:14,382
- We’ve been together since our
wedding.
- How long will it take?

425
00:36:14,383 --> 00:36:20,228
- How long will you have to stay?
- I don’t know.

426
00:36:20,229 --> 00:36:22,774
But it’ll be easier for me in
Pakistan.

427
00:36:22,775 --> 00:36:24,904
The worst thing is that Majid is
there.

428
00:36:25,239 --> 00:36:27,784
I’m scared.
What if it turns out bad for us?

429
00:36:27,785 --> 00:36:30,750
Don’t worry about Abdol-Majid.
And don’t worry about me.

430
00:36:31,668 --> 00:36:34,674
We’ll get away from them
and go to Europe.

431
00:36:36,762 --> 00:36:38,724
Smile for me and let me look at
you.

432
00:36:39,601 --> 00:36:40,977
Give me a smile.

433
00:36:40,978 --> 00:36:41,980
Smile.

434
00:36:44,402 --> 00:36:45,905
Where do you belong?

435
00:36:47,742 --> 00:36:49,746
No, show me,
where do you belong?

436
00:37:25,192 --> 00:37:29,074
Faezeh can’t we do something
so I can come with you?

437
00:37:29,784 --> 00:37:32,957
You’re not going anywhere! No
where!
You have to stay with mom. Hear me?

438
00:37:33,458 --> 00:37:35,170
Put it out of your head.

439
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:37,967
Are you planning on killing
her?!

440
00:37:38,551 --> 00:37:40,554
I have to go for certain
reasons.

441
00:37:40,555 --> 00:37:44,313
I know why and
you don’t need to know.

442
00:37:45,274 --> 00:37:48,739
I have to take my husband
and son and leave this
continent.

443
00:37:50,033 --> 00:37:51,703
The continent?!

444
00:37:52,747 --> 00:37:56,462
Hello? Hamid?
How are you?

445
00:37:57,924 --> 00:38:00,428
- What?
- I talked to a lawyer.

446
00:38:00,429 --> 00:38:03,392
He says you need to be here
to make things work.

447
00:38:03,393 --> 00:38:06,398
Stop that Hamid!
That wasn’t our plan.

448
00:38:06,399 --> 00:38:09,111
You said you knew someone
and could get it done.

449
00:38:09,112 --> 00:38:11,575
You have to come to the UN
office in Pakistan.

450
00:38:11,576 --> 00:38:14,999
I wrote in the forms that
we escaped together from Iran.

451
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:18,130
They wouldn’t believe me if I
hadn’t.

452
00:38:18,506 --> 00:38:21,887
The agent asked where you were
and
I said you were home with the child.

453
00:38:21,888 --> 00:38:24,936
He says you have to come for an
interview.

454
00:38:26,188 --> 00:38:29,026
- Listen Faezeh...
- Hamid I can’t!

455
00:38:29,027 --> 00:38:31,574
- I can’t get mom to approve.
- I’ll deal with her.

456
00:38:32,368 --> 00:38:36,333
I’ll make arrangements at the
border
to safely cross you over.

457
00:38:36,334 --> 00:38:38,462
I’m scared to come.

458
00:38:38,463 --> 00:38:41,343
- Pack up! Let’s go! Let’s go!
- Wait a second.

459
00:38:41,344 --> 00:38:44,893
- They’re terrifying me!
- Mom, wait a second.

460
00:38:45,435 --> 00:38:47,981
I’m going!

461
00:38:47,982 --> 00:38:52,449
- I’m not listening to this
stuff!
- Mom you don’t need to burst a pipe!

462
00:38:53,285 --> 00:38:57,750
- Mom, what’re you doing?
- Why’re you so against it.

463
00:38:57,751 --> 00:39:00,924
Let them try and go, maybe
I can go with them to study...

464
00:39:00,925 --> 00:39:03,470
- Stop talking!
- Maybe we’ll come back and take
you!

465
00:39:03,471 --> 00:39:06,100
I went through hell to raise
you!

466
00:39:06,101 --> 00:39:09,817
We want to leave for the future
of our child.

467
00:39:09,818 --> 00:39:12,237
Maybe things will be better over
there.

468
00:39:12,238 --> 00:39:17,332
Who knows if we’ll even get
refugee status?

469
00:39:17,333 --> 00:39:21,631
- So you planned to trick me with
Hamid?
- What trick?!

470
00:39:21,632 --> 00:39:26,766
- Where’re you going? The
concrete factory?!
- Went to Pakistan to get his uncle’s approval!

471
00:39:26,767 --> 00:39:31,067
None of my friends who left have
regretted it.

472
00:39:31,068 --> 00:39:34,073
I said my daughter had to stay
nearby!

473
00:39:34,074 --> 00:39:36,661
- I said you’d stay in Tehran!
- Yes you did.

474
00:39:36,662 --> 00:39:40,085
- And now this?!
- It was my suggestion.

475
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:42,966
- Nicely done!
- Mom!

476
00:39:42,967 --> 00:39:45,304
- I won’t forgive you if you go!
- Mom!

477
00:39:47,559 --> 00:39:49,229
We’ve made up our minds.

478
00:40:01,963 --> 00:40:03,884
You lied to me.

479
00:40:05,387 --> 00:40:08,517
- You have to get her consent.
- She doesn’t know about Hamid’s
brothers.

480
00:40:08,518 --> 00:40:11,523
She’ll raise hell and
get your divorce if she finds
out!

481
00:40:11,524 --> 00:40:16,199
She shouldn’t find out.
If she does, she’ll never
forgive Hamid.

482
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,955
- Mom has to deal with it.
- How?

483
00:40:18,956 --> 00:40:21,961
- You’ve got to go.
- I say you shouldn’t go.

484
00:40:21,962 --> 00:40:25,384
- Listen to me for once.
- I want to go.

485
00:40:25,385 --> 00:40:28,765
- I’m worried like this.
- There’s only one way.

486
00:40:28,766 --> 00:40:31,688
Call her from Pakistan
and say you’re there.

487
00:40:31,689 --> 00:40:35,028
She’ll never forgive me!
I’m too scared to go...

488
00:40:35,029 --> 00:40:37,575
- I’ll come with you.
- I can’t.

489
00:40:37,576 --> 00:40:41,290
This way mom will be less
worried too.
What do you think?

490
00:40:41,291 --> 00:40:44,338
- It makes sense.
- You can’t come.

491
00:40:44,339 --> 00:40:48,472
- What’ll my husband think?
- Listen to her! She doesn’t want
me there.

492
00:40:48,473 --> 00:40:50,393
He’s not gonna stay there.

493
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:54,401
I’ll hand you over
to your husband and come back.

494
00:40:55,445 --> 00:40:58,284
It’s Pakistan, it’s not like
you’re going to Paris!

495
00:42:03,372 --> 00:42:06,712
Pakistan, Quetta, 2005

496
00:42:40,154 --> 00:42:43,452
Look at that!
You’re only one and travelling
abroad!

497
00:43:06,581 --> 00:43:08,169
Welcome!

498
00:43:09,963 --> 00:43:11,425
Come in Faezeh.

499
00:43:13,971 --> 00:43:16,852
If this is Pakistan,
imagine what Canada’s like!

500
00:43:17,437 --> 00:43:19,357
Look at this house!

501
00:43:20,652 --> 00:43:22,947
- It’s like Amir Khan’s in
“Heart”.
- It’s big isn’t it?

502
00:43:22,948 --> 00:43:25,577
- Yeah.
- Not like the beehives in
Tehran.

503
00:43:25,578 --> 00:43:27,206
It’s cool.

504
00:43:27,207 --> 00:43:28,668
Give that to me.

505
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,172
That’s the kitchen.

506
00:43:31,173 --> 00:43:33,761
It’s a bit messy.

507
00:43:34,346 --> 00:43:37,017
Why did you get a place so big?

508
00:43:37,310 --> 00:43:41,860
- We’re not staying long.
- It belongs to a relative.

509
00:43:41,861 --> 00:43:46,620
They left Pakistan
and said we could stay here.

510
00:43:48,916 --> 00:43:51,629
And this is our place.

511
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:53,884
Looks like a sports stadium!

512
00:43:53,885 --> 00:43:56,724
They knew we wouldn’t stay long
so it’s not fully furnished.

513
00:43:57,392 --> 00:43:58,978
Shahaab come here.

514
00:43:59,271 --> 00:44:06,074
- There’s a small bed in here for
you...
- I’ll sleep in front of the TV.

515
00:44:06,075 --> 00:44:09,916
- Noureddin’s praying. I’ll show
you later.
- You’ve got a VCR...

516
00:44:09,917 --> 00:44:11,710
- You can’t.
- And a hookah pipe too!

517
00:44:11,711 --> 00:44:14,802
You’ve got to go in there at
night.
We don’t have a bedroom.

518
00:44:15,135 --> 00:44:16,971
The rooms are locked.

519
00:44:16,972 --> 00:44:19,894
They’ve built a wall and
my brothers are downstairs.

520
00:44:19,895 --> 00:44:22,775
- It’s got plenty of space.
- Your brothers? You mean Majid?

521
00:44:22,776 --> 00:44:28,078
- No Abdol-Vahed and the others.
- Why did you grow a beard?

522
00:44:28,495 --> 00:44:31,961
For the sorrow of being away
from you.
You don’t like it?

523
00:44:33,046 --> 00:44:34,048
No.

524
00:44:35,092 --> 00:44:37,096
Oh no! Give me your phone.
I’ve got to call mom!

525
00:44:37,597 --> 00:44:43,274
- Have you got any Bollywood
films here?
- Don’t touch those. They’re not mine.

526
00:44:43,275 --> 00:44:45,738
It’s personal films?

527
00:44:46,030 --> 00:44:48,159
How does this work?

528
00:44:50,539 --> 00:44:52,543
Pull up its antenna.

529
00:44:53,169 --> 00:44:57,594
I’ve got a child, a husband.
I’ve got to think about my own
life.

530
00:44:57,595 --> 00:45:00,810
Stop screaming!
Please stop mom.

531
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:35,628
It would be nice if younger
folks
listened to their elders.

532
00:45:35,629 --> 00:45:37,592
Ghamnaz!

533
00:45:38,093 --> 00:45:39,887
What’re you doing here?

534
00:45:39,888 --> 00:45:43,144
You’re so covered up!
Did you all come here?

535
00:45:43,729 --> 00:45:46,150
Why didn’t Hamid say anything?

536
00:45:46,944 --> 00:45:50,867
Why didn’t you listen to me?
I told you not to come here.

537
00:45:50,868 --> 00:45:52,997
I didn’t know you were in
Pakistan.

538
00:45:52,998 --> 00:45:55,460
I called several times
but you didn’t answer.

539
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:58,841
- Have you moved here for good?
- I don’t know.

540
00:45:58,842 --> 00:46:02,766
My sons brought me here.
I don’t know if we’ll stay or
go.

541
00:46:02,767 --> 00:46:04,020
Hi mom.

542
00:46:04,646 --> 00:46:08,193
- How are you? Where were you?
- I went to visit the sick.

543
00:46:08,194 --> 00:46:11,199
Why didn’t you tell me your
family was here?

544
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:14,039
I didn’t think it was important.

545
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:17,796
Of course it makes a difference!
I wouldn’t try so hard to come
here.

546
00:46:17,797 --> 00:46:21,804
I’ve been through so much for
you!

547
00:46:21,805 --> 00:46:24,143
You can’t give it all up so
easily.
Let’s go out.

548
00:46:24,602 --> 00:46:27,024
Come have some tea
when you’re done.

549
00:46:27,274 --> 00:46:31,156
I didn’t meet this brother.
What happened to him?

550
00:46:31,157 --> 00:46:33,870
He was martyred in Afghanistan,
fighting the Americans.

551
00:46:46,981 --> 00:46:49,694
They said we’ve got to wait.
But how long?

552
00:46:50,362 --> 00:46:52,949
- I wish they’d tell us.
- We don’t have a choice.

553
00:46:52,950 --> 00:46:58,002
But it’ll be great if we can go
to England.
We’ve got family there.

554
00:46:58,003 --> 00:47:01,425
What’s this smell?
I’m going to get sick!

555
00:47:01,885 --> 00:47:06,018
They’re cooking Beryooni.
You used to like it.

556
00:47:06,019 --> 00:47:09,941
I’ll go back to Iran in a day or
two.

557
00:47:09,942 --> 00:47:13,616
I’ve imposed on you enough.
I’ve been here a month!

558
00:47:13,617 --> 00:47:17,542
- You’re like a brother it’s not
an imposition.
- Thanks.

559
00:47:17,833 --> 00:47:20,838
If you stay we may be able
to immigrate together.

560
00:47:20,839 --> 00:47:24,680
No, he’s got to go. Mom is
alone.
Don’t even mention it!

561
00:47:24,681 --> 00:47:27,143
Moussa is with your mom.

562
00:47:27,144 --> 00:47:30,107
And if he goes back he’ll have
to go do his military service.

563
00:47:30,108 --> 00:47:33,030
This is a small town.
He’ll get bored soon.

564
00:47:33,031 --> 00:47:35,326
He can go to Karachi.
I’ve got a friend there.

565
00:47:35,327 --> 00:47:37,581
He sells cosmetics and is doing
well.

566
00:47:37,582 --> 00:47:41,589
He can go work there until
our paperwork comes through.

567
00:47:41,590 --> 00:47:44,303
- Cool! High five!
- High five!

568
00:47:45,305 --> 00:47:47,266
- Bro!
- Don’t do this.

569
00:47:47,267 --> 00:47:50,106
- I’ve got to tell mom first.
- Tell mom what? What’s she gonna
say?

570
00:47:50,107 --> 00:47:53,070
- She wants my progress doesn’t
she?
- Progress?!

571
00:47:53,071 --> 00:47:54,530
Yes progress!

572
00:47:54,531 --> 00:47:57,871
Anil Kapoor was a doorman,
Raj Kapoor was a guard,

573
00:47:57,872 --> 00:48:01,253
Jim Carrey was a construction
worker...

574
00:48:01,254 --> 00:48:04,259
- Shahrokh Khan?
- no, Shahrokh Khan was a
rich kid...

575
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:06,723
- Really?
- Yes, I’ve done the research.

576
00:50:09,676 --> 00:50:10,846
Help him.

577
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:18,152
Empty the cars.

578
00:50:22,494 --> 00:50:24,791
Abdol-Sattar, hurry,
come here

579
00:50:31,178 --> 00:50:33,850
What’re you doing?
Come here!

580
00:51:56,849 --> 00:51:59,812
- Saeed’s sleeping.
- Why’ve you locked the doors?

581
00:51:59,813 --> 00:52:01,943
I didn’t want anyone to walk in.

582
00:52:02,401 --> 00:52:06,368
Don’t worry.
My brothers won’t just walk in.

583
00:52:07,078 --> 00:52:09,415
They know we’re here.

584
00:52:12,213 --> 00:52:13,215
You look pretty.

585
00:52:14,342 --> 00:52:19,853
You looked like a pearl before,
but now you’re like the full
moon.

586
00:52:21,023 --> 00:52:23,318
Let me go wash up.

587
00:52:24,696 --> 00:52:26,866
- What news of the UN?
- Nothing.

588
00:52:26,867 --> 00:52:28,579
Don’t go outside looking like
that.

589
00:52:29,873 --> 00:52:31,752
Not for anything.

590
00:52:41,063 --> 00:52:42,982
I can’t bear being apart.

591
00:53:07,782 --> 00:53:11,790
God has given both life and
death,
it gets decided on the battlefield brothers.

592
00:53:12,166 --> 00:53:15,756
All those who speak
of other gods, of dissent,

593
00:53:15,757 --> 00:53:18,638
of blasphemy,

594
00:53:19,222 --> 00:53:24,315
will not be able to withstand
Allah...

595
00:53:54,292 --> 00:53:55,878
Come here! Come here!

596
00:53:59,427 --> 00:54:01,973
Do you know what your sons are
doing?!

597
00:54:01,974 --> 00:54:04,311
You know and you keep silent?!

598
00:54:04,312 --> 00:54:06,191
Look at this! Look!

599
00:54:06,650 --> 00:54:10,031
They killed two soldiers just
like that!

600
00:54:11,159 --> 00:54:13,537
You can’t change anything.

601
00:54:13,538 --> 00:54:15,793
I couldn’t.
You can’t either.

602
00:54:16,085 --> 00:54:20,386
A woman’s words are worthless,
whether a mother or a wife.

603
00:54:20,970 --> 00:54:23,893
- This was my fate.
- Why didn’t you warn me?!

604
00:54:24,227 --> 00:54:27,316
Why didn’t you tell me
not to come into this hell?

605
00:54:27,734 --> 00:54:31,866
I thought his brothers were into
drugs!

606
00:54:31,867 --> 00:54:36,333
I had no idea it was this
stuff...

607
00:54:36,334 --> 00:54:38,714
I don’t have a phone!
They didn’t give me one.

608
00:54:39,048 --> 00:54:42,305
I told you not to come.
What else could I say?

609
00:54:43,724 --> 00:54:47,691
Please, tell me.
Is Hamid like Abdol-Majid too?

610
00:54:48,525 --> 00:54:51,531
Whose house is this?
Abdol-Majid’s?

611
00:55:14,034 --> 00:55:18,334
It’s Abdol-Majid’s house,
but he never comes here.

612
00:55:18,335 --> 00:55:20,881
He has his own house.

613
00:55:20,882 --> 00:55:23,469
He’s changed.
He’s become wild.

614
00:55:23,470 --> 00:55:26,852
At first he studied religion.
Then he joined Al-Qaeda.

615
00:55:27,395 --> 00:55:32,321
He knew the border and
smuggled Al-Qaeda forces into
Iraq.

616
00:55:32,738 --> 00:55:35,869
They gave him money
and he bought guns.

617
00:55:35,870 --> 00:55:39,419
The Iranian government found out
so he escaped here.

618
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:43,467
Now he’s somebody for himself.

619
00:55:43,468 --> 00:55:45,765
He’s separated from Al-Qaeda.

620
00:55:46,266 --> 00:55:48,812
They call him Malek.
Abdol-Malek.

621
00:55:48,813 --> 00:55:51,108
Even God can’t
stand up to him now.

622
00:55:52,361 --> 00:55:54,699
Hamid wasn’t like this.

623
00:55:56,243 --> 00:56:01,002
He was different from his
brothers.
He’s still different.

624
00:56:01,003 --> 00:56:05,136
Noureddin thinks Abdol-Majid’s
a drug smuggler.

625
00:56:05,387 --> 00:56:08,101
I’m afraid to tell him.

626
00:56:08,727 --> 00:56:11,189
Take your child and go away.

627
00:56:11,190 --> 00:56:13,362
Who knows how Abdol-Hamid will
turn out?

628
00:56:13,737 --> 00:56:17,786
Abdol-Majid does everything for
him,
and makes him indebted.

629
00:56:18,914 --> 00:56:22,380
I’ve buried three sons so far,

630
00:56:23,673 --> 00:56:25,677
and one’s in prison.

631
00:56:28,683 --> 00:56:31,689
With what Abdol-Majid’s doing,
I’ll lose the rest of them too.

632
00:56:32,441 --> 00:56:35,739
The most innocent of them died
in front of my eyes.

633
00:56:38,286 --> 00:56:41,877
There’s nothing worst in the
world
than knowing your children are in the wrong.

634
00:56:44,298 --> 00:56:46,428
I’ve become disgraced in the
tribe.

635
00:56:50,143 --> 00:56:53,817
You’re their mother.
You brought them into the
world...

636
00:56:54,109 --> 00:56:57,240
I am God’s helpless creature.

637
00:56:58,367 --> 00:57:01,999
Al-Qaeda believes a woman
is less than the dirt you walk
on.

638
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,129
Abdol-Majid and his brothers
have been brainwashed.

639
00:57:04,714 --> 00:57:06,927
They believe in these things.

640
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:10,141
They believe they are soldiers
of God.

641
00:57:10,642 --> 00:57:14,066
It means they have to sacrifice
their mothers, fathers, wives
and children.

642
00:57:14,692 --> 00:57:17,490
They have violated Islam.

643
00:57:17,907 --> 00:57:21,455
They think everyone is wrong
except for them.

644
00:57:21,456 --> 00:57:24,921
They believe it’s a good deed
if they kill others.

645
00:57:26,508 --> 00:57:29,471
There is unemployment
and poverty here.

646
00:57:29,472 --> 00:57:32,686
The young are unemployed.
They have nothing to eat.

647
00:57:33,021 --> 00:57:35,399
So they turn to smuggling drugs.

648
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:39,157
But no one asks why they turn to
drugs,

649
00:57:39,158 --> 00:57:42,748
or why they become fanatics...

650
00:57:44,877 --> 00:57:47,006
They put a bullet in the
soldiers’ brains.

651
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:51,474
- They killed them...
- You and I don’t understand
these things.

652
00:57:52,184 --> 00:57:55,482
- You have to go back to Iran.
- We’re trying to get paperwork
to leave...

653
00:57:55,732 --> 00:57:59,364
Who knows when that will happen,
and what’ll happen to
Abdol-Hamid by then.

654
00:57:59,657 --> 00:58:03,789
I will arrange everything.
Don’t say a word until I tell
you.

655
00:58:03,790 --> 00:58:07,506
And don’t call anyone.
They’ve bugged the phones.

656
00:58:18,612 --> 00:58:21,492
Faezeh dear, get my towel.

657
00:58:35,771 --> 00:58:38,234
There’re two babies on the way.

658
00:58:39,069 --> 00:58:41,115
Congratulations.

659
00:58:42,701 --> 00:58:45,290
Congratulations dear!
You’re having twins!

660
00:58:47,545 --> 00:58:50,717
-It’ll make our immigration more
difficult.
-No,

661
00:58:51,427 --> 00:58:54,850
it’ll make things better.
It’ll make it easier.

662
00:59:00,528 --> 00:59:01,822
This is for you.

663
00:59:01,823 --> 00:59:05,664
A lady who makes beautiful
babies
should wear a gold watch.

664
00:59:06,248 --> 00:59:09,504
- Where did you get the money?
- This place is a family hangout.

665
00:59:09,964 --> 00:59:12,093
We know the owner.

666
00:59:12,094 --> 00:59:15,515
Do you believe I used to work
here?
Before selling cosmetics...

667
00:59:15,516 --> 00:59:17,688
Where did you get the money
for the watch?

668
00:59:20,318 --> 00:59:24,200
My brothers owed me some money
and gave some of it back.

669
00:59:24,201 --> 00:59:26,623
They’ll give the rest before we
go.

670
00:59:28,752 --> 00:59:30,630
- Hello?
- Faezeh, hi.

671
00:59:30,631 --> 00:59:33,468
Hi mom. How are you?
How’s Moussa?

672
00:59:33,469 --> 00:59:35,597
- Give her my regards.
- Hamid says hello.

673
00:59:35,598 --> 00:59:38,102
What’s wrong sweetheart?
Are you unwell?

674
00:59:38,103 --> 00:59:42,696
No, I’m okay.
Hamid’s brought me to a
restaurant.

675
00:59:43,823 --> 00:59:46,578
Saeed’s fine, he’s with Ghamnaz.

676
00:59:49,543 --> 00:59:53,884
The news keeps showing bombings
and killings in Sistan and
Baluchistan.

677
00:59:53,885 --> 00:59:55,721
They say it’s Abdol-Malek Rigi.

678
00:59:55,722 --> 00:59:58,645
Moussa said he might be Hamid’s
relative.
Is that true?

679
00:59:59,855 --> 01:00:02,568
- Their last name is Rigi too.
- I don’t know mom.

680
01:00:02,569 --> 01:00:05,783
The Rigi’s are a big tribe in
Baluchistan.
And they’re all nice people.

681
01:00:05,784 --> 01:00:07,871
You can’t blame them all for one
bad apple.

682
01:00:08,456 --> 01:00:10,793
Hamid is careful.

683
01:00:10,794 --> 01:00:15,345
He’s against Abdol-Malek.
All the Rigis are against him
too.

684
01:00:16,054 --> 01:00:17,639
Don’t worry.

685
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:22,735
- Hamid’s family is very nice to
me.
- I’m worried honey.

686
01:00:24,529 --> 01:00:27,618
It’s okay mom.
Hamid is careful.

687
01:00:27,619 --> 01:00:31,459
He’ll take care of us.
He’s very excited that I’m
pregnant.

688
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:33,756
Send Shahaab back.

689
01:00:33,757 --> 01:00:38,766
I keep telling him but he won’t
listen.
He says he’s making good money.

690
01:00:38,767 --> 01:00:42,482
- Okay sweetheart, I’ll call
later.
- Okay, bye.

691
01:00:43,943 --> 01:00:46,824
- Did you hear what she said?
- How could I hear?

692
01:00:47,826 --> 01:00:49,621
Is Abdol-Malek Rigi your
brother?

693
01:00:50,373 --> 01:00:51,667
Is it Majid?

694
01:00:52,001 --> 01:00:53,629
Say something!
I’m scared.

695
01:00:53,963 --> 01:00:58,180
I never imagined your brother
would be a member of Al-Qaeda!

696
01:00:58,890 --> 01:01:00,601
Did my mom tell you?

697
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:06,362
Hamid are you involved with him?

698
01:01:06,363 --> 01:01:09,243
- What if he comes after you?
- He’s not Al-Qaeda!

699
01:01:10,204 --> 01:01:12,960
He’s his own man.
Everyone here respects him.

700
01:01:13,795 --> 01:01:15,506
All I care about is leaving.

701
01:01:16,508 --> 01:01:19,388
You’re holding my leash thank
God!

702
01:01:19,389 --> 01:01:22,228
We’ll go live in peace
in a corner of the world.

703
01:01:23,272 --> 01:01:28,991
Can you arrange things
so I could go back to Iran soon?

704
01:01:28,992 --> 01:01:30,453
What?

705
01:01:30,745 --> 01:01:32,582
Are you threatening me?!

706
01:01:33,417 --> 01:01:35,004
I just want to eat my damn
lunch!

707
01:02:01,432 --> 01:02:05,564
My brothers are behind that
wall.
You don’t need to go there.

708
01:02:05,565 --> 01:02:07,776
That’s your room.
I’ll show you.

709
01:02:07,777 --> 01:02:09,780
- Hi.
- Hello.

710
01:02:09,781 --> 01:02:12,286
- How are you mom?
- Good.

711
01:02:12,913 --> 01:02:13,915
Hi Faezeh.

712
01:02:15,042 --> 01:02:17,212
I’ve brought help.
Her name’s Asil.

713
01:02:17,213 --> 01:02:19,468
She’ll come in the mornings
until 5.

714
01:02:20,511 --> 01:02:24,267
That’s good with my aching leg,
she can help take care of the
place.

715
01:02:24,268 --> 01:02:26,272
She can’t talk. She’s a mute.

716
01:02:26,690 --> 01:02:28,151
Are you okay Faezeh?

717
01:02:29,821 --> 01:02:31,950
This is my mom.
She’ll tell you what to do.

718
01:02:31,951 --> 01:02:37,252
I’m going to Karachi tomorrow.
I’m taking a letter to the UN
office there.

719
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:39,298
I may check up on Shahaab too.

720
01:05:33,396 --> 01:05:34,774
- Give that.
- Hello.

721
01:05:35,525 --> 01:05:36,987
Thank you.

722
01:05:37,529 --> 01:05:40,535
- When are you leaving?
- When Behrouz tells me.

723
01:05:44,418 --> 01:05:47,423
- I’ll buy some cigarettes.
- Stay here.

724
01:05:47,424 --> 01:05:51,975
Don’t get out, even if Saeed
cries.

725
01:05:54,313 --> 01:05:58,530
- I’ll go get you some snacks.
- Thank you.

726
01:06:04,082 --> 01:06:05,502
Let’s call your uncle.

727
01:06:58,149 --> 01:07:00,612
Abdol-Majid what are you doing?

728
01:07:01,196 --> 01:07:02,449
Stop! Wait!

729
01:07:02,784 --> 01:07:04,370
Get out!

730
01:07:05,204 --> 01:07:07,042
Let her go!

731
01:08:05,910 --> 01:08:06,910
Hamid!

732
01:08:07,871 --> 01:08:09,874
Open the door!

733
01:08:09,875 --> 01:08:13,675
Ghamnaz! Open the door!
Why have you locked me in?

734
01:08:15,512 --> 01:08:17,640
Hamid, open up!

735
01:08:17,641 --> 01:08:19,394
Open the door!

736
01:08:19,395 --> 01:08:21,147
Open it!

737
01:08:21,148 --> 01:08:22,692
Open it!

738
01:08:22,693 --> 01:08:23,861
Open it!

739
01:09:22,270 --> 01:09:24,692
Faezeh! Are you okay?

740
01:09:33,167 --> 01:09:36,841
Son, take your wife and leave.

741
01:09:37,092 --> 01:09:39,887
Don’t destroy yourself.
Don’t follow Malek.

742
01:09:39,888 --> 01:09:41,975
He’s insane.
He’s a murderer.

743
01:09:41,976 --> 01:09:47,738
He thinks he’s doing the right
thing,
but he’s killed innocent people.

744
01:09:48,197 --> 01:09:50,827
Don’t you believe
in Mowlana Abdol-Hamid?

745
01:09:51,453 --> 01:09:54,793
God says he will let you
in heaven for your deeds.

746
01:09:55,545 --> 01:10:00,763
If you commit murder,
you will not get in...

747
01:10:00,764 --> 01:10:03,184
-You’ve been like a father to
me,
-Listen to me!

748
01:10:03,185 --> 01:10:07,401
But you wanted to take my wife
away from me. I won’t forgive
you.

749
01:10:07,402 --> 01:10:08,904
Thank God.

750
01:10:08,905 --> 01:10:12,912
- What happened?
- It’s because of stress.

751
01:10:12,913 --> 01:10:15,918
It’s dangerous for her and the
babies.

752
01:10:15,919 --> 01:10:18,215
She shouldn’t get stressed.

753
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:21,722
She’s okay now.
Nothing to worry about.

754
01:10:22,182 --> 01:10:23,350
Bye.

755
01:10:42,681 --> 01:10:44,977
Mom, take Saeed.

756
01:11:24,138 --> 01:11:26,226
- Are you better?
- How is Noureddin?

757
01:11:27,102 --> 01:11:30,484
- They shot him in the leg!
- Don’t worry about him.

758
01:11:30,944 --> 01:11:33,700
- It’s just a scar.
- Why do you lock the door?

759
01:11:35,829 --> 01:11:39,376
- Because my wife’s trying to run
away.
- Don’t you wonder why I want to run away?

760
01:11:39,377 --> 01:11:41,004
I don’t know.

761
01:11:41,005 --> 01:11:45,849
I’ve provided everything for
you.
I don’t know why you want to run away.

762
01:11:46,308 --> 01:11:49,272
- What have I done to you?
- I don’t want this comfort!

763
01:11:50,358 --> 01:11:54,448
I just want a quiet life.
Without any hassles.

764
01:11:54,449 --> 01:11:57,748
- To raise our children.
- What hassles?

765
01:11:57,956 --> 01:12:01,087
I’ve agreed to everything you’ve
wanted!

766
01:12:02,089 --> 01:12:04,593
- You wanted to leave Iran, and I
agreed...
- Let’s go back to Iran.

767
01:12:04,594 --> 01:12:06,891
I’m not your plaything!

768
01:12:07,558 --> 01:12:09,562
We’ve gone this far...

769
01:12:11,149 --> 01:12:15,408
Tell me why you wanted to run
away
and take my children from me?

770
01:12:19,332 --> 01:12:21,627
- Abdol-Malek knew you better
than I did.
- Malek!

771
01:12:21,628 --> 01:12:24,759
- He told me not to trust you.
- If he knew anything

772
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:27,932
he wouldn’t kill people!
He wouldn’t murder his own
countrymen!

773
01:12:27,933 --> 01:12:30,478
- He wants to defend the
Baluchis.
- Defend the Baluchis?!

774
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:34,320
Isn’t your uncle a Baluch?
And all those people who’ve been
killed?

775
01:12:34,321 --> 01:12:36,532
And you repeating his words!

776
01:12:36,533 --> 01:12:40,247
The Baluch are kind, don’t you
remember
how they treated us on our honeymoon?

777
01:12:40,248 --> 01:12:43,922
They had one lamb and wanted to
cook it for us.

778
01:12:43,923 --> 01:12:46,677
They honor their guests.

779
01:12:46,678 --> 01:12:49,684
- They don’t murder people in
God’s house.
- You wanted to steal my children!

780
01:12:50,060 --> 01:12:52,439
To rob me of what I love!

781
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:55,737
Why didn’t you ask yourself why
I wanted to get away from this
hell!

782
01:12:55,738 --> 01:12:58,451
- Hell?!
- Why your mother took my side!

783
01:12:58,452 --> 01:13:00,873
- Have you asked yourself that?
- Is this a hell to you?

784
01:13:00,874 --> 01:13:05,925
Someone who kills innocent
people
can also kill me and my children!

785
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:13,983
Malek didn’t kill anyone.
They were all infidels.

786
01:13:16,446 --> 01:13:18,575
How can you say such a thing?

787
01:13:20,162 --> 01:13:23,878
My brother Malek.
Just see how many followers he
has.

788
01:13:25,172 --> 01:13:27,760
You’re inciting me against my
brother.

789
01:13:28,595 --> 01:13:30,849
You think you can do that
just because I love you?

790
01:13:33,439 --> 01:13:37,989
Malek has proof in the Quran
for everything he says.

791
01:13:38,364 --> 01:13:40,242
He has studied religion.

792
01:13:40,243 --> 01:13:44,376
He was in Al-Qaeda and studied
Islam.
He didn’t just recite the Quran.

793
01:13:46,089 --> 01:13:50,431
Listen,
I’m not part of Malek’s group.

794
01:13:50,974 --> 01:13:52,351
I don’t have the guts for it.

795
01:13:53,353 --> 01:13:57,403
I wish I had a bit of his
courage,
or was as strong as him.

796
01:13:58,071 --> 01:14:01,745
But I’m thankful just for a gulp
of water.

797
01:14:02,287 --> 01:14:04,709
All I do is for the sake of our
children.

798
01:14:06,630 --> 01:14:09,176
I’m selfish enough to think of
myself.

799
01:14:09,802 --> 01:14:14,270
It’s best if I go live with you
abroad.
I know myself.

800
01:14:20,574 --> 01:14:21,994
Try to be good.

801
01:14:23,580 --> 01:14:26,169
Don’t cry.
Look at me.

802
01:14:29,383 --> 01:14:32,557
Look at me.
See what you’ve done to
yourself.

803
01:14:34,727 --> 01:14:37,942
But your eyes are even
more beautiful when you cry.

804
01:14:39,946 --> 01:14:41,365
Cry for me.

805
01:14:44,539 --> 01:14:46,333
A bit more.

806
01:14:46,334 --> 01:14:47,334
More.

807
01:14:52,763 --> 01:14:55,603
Now get ready,
let’s go out to lunch.

808
01:15:09,506 --> 01:15:11,800
Don’t get upset but
I don’t have an appetite.

809
01:15:11,801 --> 01:15:13,345
You have to eat.

810
01:15:13,346 --> 01:15:16,435
Think of the babies in your
belly.

811
01:15:25,871 --> 01:15:26,871
Eat, it’s good.

812
01:15:28,084 --> 01:15:31,716
Put some of this one it.
You like it.

813
01:15:33,303 --> 01:15:35,348
Put some of this on.
Maybe you’ll eat then.

814
01:15:38,479 --> 01:15:43,823
Can’t we apply for refugee
status
from Turkey instead of Pakistan?

815
01:15:43,824 --> 01:15:46,245
For the love of God,
let’s eat in peace!

816
01:16:16,890 --> 01:16:18,559
Eat.

817
01:16:22,567 --> 01:16:24,112
Take a bite.

818
01:16:57,637 --> 01:16:59,641
You’ve brought the prisoner for
a break?

819
01:17:00,059 --> 01:17:02,438
- She was trying to run away!
- She wasn’t running away...

820
01:17:02,439 --> 01:17:06,029
- What if she’s an enemy agent?
- My wife is totally honest with
me.

821
01:17:11,582 --> 01:17:13,920
Did you know Iranian
Intelligence
has been to see them?

822
01:17:14,463 --> 01:17:16,174
After your wedding?

823
01:17:17,344 --> 01:17:21,476
They came to see me.
You were already in Pakistan.

824
01:17:21,477 --> 01:17:23,797
- Don’t you believe me?
- So why was she trying to run
away?

825
01:17:23,982 --> 01:17:26,821
She’s been home the entire time.

826
01:17:27,364 --> 01:17:31,120
Think about what you’re saying.
Noureddin planned it.

827
01:17:31,121 --> 01:17:34,962
Our mom put it in her head,
encouraging her to run away.

828
01:17:35,839 --> 01:17:37,843
Why doesn’t our mother
run away herself?

829
01:17:38,929 --> 01:17:40,974
It’s not Faezeh’s fault.
Are you insane?

830
01:17:41,976 --> 01:17:43,396
Enemy agent!

831
01:17:56,965 --> 01:18:01,222
She was stupid,
but forgiveness is a virtue.

832
01:18:01,223 --> 01:18:04,645
- Mowlana Abdol-Hamid says...
- His path is separate from ours.

833
01:18:04,646 --> 01:18:07,151
We follow our own path,
do you understand?

834
01:18:08,571 --> 01:18:10,868
This is not the place to talk.

835
01:18:11,410 --> 01:18:13,289
We’ll meet and
I’ll make you understand.

836
01:19:53,155 --> 01:19:54,783
Hamid!

837
01:19:56,620 --> 01:19:57,914
Hamid!

838
01:20:00,878 --> 01:20:02,215
Ghamnaz!

839
01:20:05,387 --> 01:20:06,599
Asil!

840
01:21:52,644 --> 01:21:54,354
Hello?

841
01:21:54,355 --> 01:21:57,109
- Hamid? Where are you?!
- Is that you Faezeh?

842
01:21:57,110 --> 01:22:00,576
Saeed isn’t here!
I woke up and saw he was gone!

843
01:22:00,910 --> 01:22:02,914
- Where are you calling from?
- Downstairs.

844
01:22:03,498 --> 01:22:06,044
- Why are you there?
- I looked everywhere!

845
01:22:06,045 --> 01:22:08,717
My son’s missing.
He’s disappeared!

846
01:22:08,718 --> 01:22:10,929
Don’t worry.
He’s with me.

847
01:22:10,930 --> 01:22:13,434
You were sleeping so I didn’t
wake you.
He’s with me.

848
01:22:13,435 --> 01:22:16,274
He should be around men a while.

849
01:22:16,650 --> 01:22:20,700
And you’ll be able to rest.
We don’t want him to get spoilt.

850
01:22:21,576 --> 01:22:25,209
Faezeh, don’t worry, he’s safe.

851
01:22:25,835 --> 01:22:30,218
Yesterday a 15-year-old
suicide-bomber
did an operation in Zahedan.

852
01:22:30,219 --> 01:22:31,679
Ghamnaz!

853
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:34,184
I am responsible
for the blood that is shed.

854
01:22:34,185 --> 01:22:36,272
It is not a joke.
You can see the film.

855
01:22:36,273 --> 01:22:38,610
I put it by the TV

856
01:22:39,069 --> 01:22:42,659
Take a look and see how his
friends
sent him away with joy,

857
01:22:42,660 --> 01:22:45,791
so he could join
the Prophet in heaven.

858
01:22:45,792 --> 01:22:48,504
- But I don’t have the courage.
- Asil!

859
01:22:48,505 --> 01:22:51,385
I’ll keep my word and
build a comfortable life for
you.

860
01:22:51,386 --> 01:22:54,516
But I don’t deserve this
comfort.

861
01:22:54,517 --> 01:22:57,439
More and more I believe
what Majid says is true.

862
01:22:57,440 --> 01:23:00,821
I don’t have the courage for
Jihad,
but I shouldn’t be against it either.

863
01:23:00,822 --> 01:23:03,409
How will I answer
the martyrs in the afterlife?

864
01:23:03,410 --> 01:23:07,625
Where’s Ghamnaz?
Where’s my mother-in-law?

865
01:23:07,626 --> 01:23:08,628
Talk to me!

866
01:23:10,424 --> 01:23:12,720
Where is Ghamnaz?!
Where is Noureddin?!

867
01:23:13,347 --> 01:23:15,683
Talk!
Are you pretending to be mute?!

868
01:23:15,684 --> 01:23:18,105
Are you one of them?!

869
01:23:18,106 --> 01:23:19,524
Are you?!

870
01:23:19,525 --> 01:23:20,945
Are you?!

871
01:24:26,826 --> 01:24:32,087
Approaching the area 30 minutes
before the operation.

872
01:24:32,796 --> 01:24:40,796
Preparing for the greatest
attack
by Jundallah, led by Abdol-Malek...

873
01:24:40,897 --> 01:24:44,193
Jihad, war, and killing
God’s enemies are a necessity.

874
01:24:44,194 --> 01:24:48,077
We have to fight old and new
infidels.
Islam is a religion of war, not peace.

875
01:24:48,620 --> 01:24:52,502
Those who want to combine Islam
with
liberalism, democracy, and peace, are infidels,

876
01:24:52,503 --> 01:24:54,506
it is our obligation to kill
them.

877
01:24:54,507 --> 01:24:59,224
The war with infidels is between
good and bad.
The world is with us or against us.

878
01:24:59,517 --> 01:25:01,186
A world of infidels or Islam.

879
01:25:01,187 --> 01:25:05,070
Those who pretend to be
believers,
but sit at a table with infidels,

880
01:25:05,404 --> 01:25:09,368
it doesn’t matter if they are
Fars or Baluch,
they are all infidels at the tip of our swords.

881
01:25:09,369 --> 01:25:12,543
Ask God to accept every bullet
you fire.

882
01:25:12,961 --> 01:25:17,177
Brother, don’t allow fear to get
into you.

883
01:25:17,678 --> 01:25:20,684
Let’s praise Allah and begin our
work.

884
01:25:22,855 --> 01:25:26,403
[Operation by Jundallah forces
led by
Abdol-Malek Rigi in Tasouki]

885
01:25:34,504 --> 01:25:36,215
Get down! Get down!
Hurry!

886
01:25:36,423 --> 01:25:39,847
- Women to the right!
- Women and children on this
side!

887
01:25:40,223 --> 01:25:41,934
Hurry!

888
01:25:42,435 --> 01:25:43,855
Hurry!

889
01:25:46,569 --> 01:25:49,198
You used to sell CDs on street
corners!

890
01:25:49,199 --> 01:25:53,165
- I don’t need to answer you.
- You are not one of us! You are
not a Baluch!

891
01:25:53,166 --> 01:25:55,921
- I am defending the Baluch.
- You are defending us with a
gun?

892
01:25:56,506 --> 01:25:58,301
Shut up.

893
01:26:00,305 --> 01:26:02,309
I won’t do anything to the
women.

894
01:26:04,479 --> 01:26:07,735
- Do you love your country?
- We are defenders of the
country.

895
01:26:07,736 --> 01:26:09,281
You are an infidel!

896
01:26:12,162 --> 01:26:13,289
Get down!

897
01:26:14,709 --> 01:26:16,588
Hurry!

898
01:26:20,470 --> 01:26:22,265
Down! Down!

899
01:26:25,105 --> 01:26:27,525
- I said get down!
- Get down!

900
01:26:27,526 --> 01:26:30,240
Tie him!
This one too!

901
01:26:38,506 --> 01:26:41,219
- What do you do?
- I’m a student.

902
01:26:41,220 --> 01:26:43,641
- What do you study?
- I’m a student.

903
01:26:43,642 --> 01:26:45,728
But you’re as old as my dad!

904
01:26:45,729 --> 01:26:48,860
- Where is your father?
- My father is dead.

905
01:26:49,987 --> 01:26:51,574
Why are you going to Zahedan?

906
01:26:51,991 --> 01:26:54,413
What’s your name?
What do you do?

907
01:26:55,039 --> 01:26:56,208
I’m a worker.

908
01:29:18,116 --> 01:29:20,120
I want some meat.

909
01:29:29,263 --> 01:29:33,105
My phone is out of charge.
Can I call?

910
01:29:37,489 --> 01:29:38,907
Hello? Shahaab?

911
01:29:38,908 --> 01:29:41,746
I don’t have time.
I’ve sneaked out to call you.

912
01:29:41,747 --> 01:29:43,959
I’m locked up in the house!
I’m a prisoner!

913
01:29:43,960 --> 01:29:45,212
They’ve taken Saeed from me...

914
01:29:52,519 --> 01:29:55,148
They are dangerous people.
Hamid has joined them too.

915
01:29:55,149 --> 01:29:58,656
They’ve taken Saeed from me
because
they know I can’t leave without him.

916
01:30:02,246 --> 01:30:05,419
Don’t do that!
They’ve got many supporters.

917
01:30:05,420 --> 01:30:09,134
Don’t tell anything to your
boss!
Get back to Iran however you can.

918
01:30:09,135 --> 01:30:10,595
They’re very dangerous.

919
01:30:10,596 --> 01:30:13,017
They have weapons.
They smuggle and have money.

920
01:30:13,018 --> 01:30:16,817
I’m trapped because they have my
son.
Just save yourself.

921
01:30:19,322 --> 01:30:22,412
If you see mom and Moussa,
tell them to pray for me.

922
01:30:58,859 --> 01:31:00,863
Help!

923
01:31:03,661 --> 01:31:05,706
Help!

924
01:31:27,500 --> 01:31:28,961
- Get him out.
- Hurry!

925
01:31:38,522 --> 01:31:39,774
Walk!

926
01:31:44,408 --> 01:31:47,206
- Bring him here!
- You’ve made a mistake!

927
01:31:47,749 --> 01:31:51,172
I swear you’ve made a mistake!
Listen to me!

928
01:32:09,543 --> 01:32:12,799
Why’ve you tied up my relative?
Untie him.

929
01:32:15,971 --> 01:32:19,145
I’m Abdol-Majid.
Your sister’s brother-in-law.

930
01:32:27,536 --> 01:32:28,664
Get him some water.

931
01:32:32,546 --> 01:32:34,926
How’s work?
How’s Karachi?

932
01:32:36,387 --> 01:32:37,974
Getting paid well?

933
01:32:38,642 --> 01:32:41,773
They didn’t know we’re family.

934
01:32:42,692 --> 01:32:45,906
If you want I can punish them.

935
01:32:47,033 --> 01:32:48,452
- No.
- Believe me.

936
01:32:48,453 --> 01:32:49,914
They didn’t do anything.

937
01:32:51,542 --> 01:32:53,171
I miss Saeed.

938
01:32:54,465 --> 01:32:56,927
I’ve bought him a ton of toys.

939
01:32:56,928 --> 01:32:59,975
All guns.
Military stuff.

940
01:32:59,976 --> 01:33:04,402
He has to practice,
get used to guns.

941
01:33:04,986 --> 01:33:06,572
- Do you want anything?
- A cigarette.

942
01:33:07,533 --> 01:33:10,539
- They emptied my pockets.
- Who?

943
01:33:10,831 --> 01:33:13,294
Who took his cigarettes?

944
01:33:13,295 --> 01:33:15,590
- Give them back.
- It was him.

945
01:33:18,388 --> 01:33:19,388
Here.

946
01:33:19,891 --> 01:33:23,315
- Did I take them by force?
- Yes.

947
01:33:44,733 --> 01:33:45,860
Thanks.

948
01:33:47,279 --> 01:33:48,531
I don’t want any.

949
01:33:57,216 --> 01:34:00,347
I know you said you’d kill us
because
you were upset about your sister.

950
01:34:02,643 --> 01:34:08,280
You wouldn’t kill your sister’s
husband,
making her children orphans.

951
01:34:09,114 --> 01:34:11,076
I know it’s not like that.

952
01:34:12,830 --> 01:34:14,667
The entire world knows me now.

953
01:34:15,209 --> 01:34:17,256
Everyone wants to meet me.

954
01:34:18,425 --> 01:34:19,509
Why?

955
01:34:19,510 --> 01:34:21,973
Because they believe in what I
do.
They believe in me.

956
01:34:22,516 --> 01:34:26,899
As you can see, when your sister
called and you planned to kill
us...

957
01:34:26,900 --> 01:34:29,195
- No.
- But we found out.

958
01:34:29,196 --> 01:34:32,577
I swear.
My sister called and was crying.

959
01:34:32,578 --> 01:34:37,212
- I got upset when I heard her
voice.
- Shahaab, Hamid and I like you.

960
01:34:37,671 --> 01:34:39,466
You’re family.

961
01:34:39,467 --> 01:34:42,473
We think you can turn
into a true fighter for God.

962
01:34:42,890 --> 01:34:45,479
We’re all Muslims and
must fight our true enemies.

963
01:34:45,813 --> 01:34:47,649
You’re not a prisoner.

964
01:34:47,984 --> 01:34:52,033
I told them to bring you here
so we could talk.

965
01:34:52,743 --> 01:34:57,042
I want to tell you
we’re not dangerous.

966
01:34:57,043 --> 01:34:59,548
We only obey God’s rules.

967
01:35:01,260 --> 01:35:03,640
You wanted to go to the
Consulate?

968
01:35:03,932 --> 01:35:07,439
We control everything here.
I can even send you to Germany.

969
01:35:07,731 --> 01:35:11,196
I have people.
I’ll do it for you.

970
01:35:12,408 --> 01:35:15,204
- My sister and her children?
- With her children,

971
01:35:15,414 --> 01:35:16,958
and her husband Abdol-Hamid.

972
01:35:17,501 --> 01:35:20,256
He insists on going
and living among infidels.

973
01:35:21,091 --> 01:35:22,511
Let him go, I don’t care.

974
01:35:23,012 --> 01:35:26,018
I believe you can be a fighter
for God.

975
01:35:26,811 --> 01:35:30,694
But if you want to leave,
that’s okay.

976
01:35:31,362 --> 01:35:32,907
I’ll send you.

977
01:35:35,871 --> 01:35:37,583
You just have to do one thing
for me.

978
01:35:43,511 --> 01:35:48,145
Five people were martyred,
and 120 injured.

979
01:35:49,983 --> 01:35:54,241
I had to collect two brothers,
15 and 17-years-old...

980
01:35:56,161 --> 01:35:59,292
- Where’s this cream from?
- I don’t know?

981
01:35:59,877 --> 01:36:04,260
- Does it clump on the face?
- Not if you apply some
moisturizer first.

982
01:36:04,261 --> 01:36:07,600
Their operations
will destroy Baluchistan.

983
01:36:07,601 --> 01:36:10,272
- How much for the lipstick?
- Which one?

984
01:36:10,273 --> 01:36:13,319
- 1,500.
- It’s expensive.

985
01:36:13,320 --> 01:36:16,117
It’s the last of Hamid’s
supplies.

986
01:36:16,118 --> 01:36:19,206
Some people have been
martyred...

987
01:36:19,207 --> 01:36:21,795
- How much for the nail polish?
- Which one?

988
01:36:21,796 --> 01:36:23,508
550.

989
01:36:32,233 --> 01:36:33,233
Hello?

990
01:36:34,029 --> 01:36:35,156
Hello?

991
01:36:35,740 --> 01:36:38,370
- Can you speak a bit louder?
- How are you?

992
01:36:39,164 --> 01:36:40,791
- You don’t know me?
- You are?

993
01:36:40,792 --> 01:36:43,590
I’m Abdol-Majid,
Hamid’s brother.

994
01:36:44,216 --> 01:36:47,222
How are you?
How come you’ve called me?

995
01:36:47,764 --> 01:36:52,523
Any news of Faezeh?
She won’t pick up when I call.

996
01:36:52,524 --> 01:36:57,075
I’m very busy
and haven’t seen Faezeh.

997
01:36:57,450 --> 01:37:00,873
-But I have news of Shahaab.
He’s fine.
-Thank God.

998
01:37:00,874 --> 01:37:05,716
Neither Faezeh nor Shahaab
answer their phones.

999
01:37:05,717 --> 01:37:10,559
They’re probably so happy
they’ve forgotten all about
their mother.

1000
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:14,358
Shahaab is fine and says hi.
He’ll be on TV tonight at 8.

1001
01:37:14,359 --> 01:37:17,364
- On channel Al-Arabiah.
- What?

1002
01:37:17,365 --> 01:37:20,412
Watch Al-Arabiah tonight,
they’ll be showing Shahaab.

1003
01:37:20,413 --> 01:37:23,836
Has he acted in a film?

1004
01:37:25,674 --> 01:37:26,841
Hello?

1005
01:37:26,842 --> 01:37:27,842
Majid?

1006
01:37:30,767 --> 01:37:35,734
I will say these things
so my sister can go back to
Iran.

1007
01:37:35,735 --> 01:37:40,452
You promised me.
I’ll feel better when she
returns.

1008
01:37:40,453 --> 01:37:42,207
You can send me afterwards.

1009
01:37:43,334 --> 01:37:47,007
- And you’ll send Saeed with her?
- Rest assured. What I say goes.

1010
01:37:47,467 --> 01:37:48,636
Thank you.

1011
01:37:51,601 --> 01:37:56,611
Tell him to connect the
satellite.
Let’s see what they’ll show.

1012
01:37:57,278 --> 01:38:00,118
I’ll keep Ghodrat’s wife and
kids.

1013
01:38:00,409 --> 01:38:03,289
His sister? It’ll by five of
them,
and four more.

1014
01:38:03,290 --> 01:38:05,086
That’s okay.
I’ll make a stew.

1015
01:38:11,431 --> 01:38:14,270
If I say something wrong,
stop and I’ll do it again.

1016
01:38:14,271 --> 01:38:18,237
If I wasn’t good, I’ll go like
this
and we can do a retake.

1017
01:38:19,071 --> 01:38:21,451
We can do as many retakes as you
want.

1018
01:38:23,164 --> 01:38:24,541
You’re ready.

1019
01:38:28,382 --> 01:38:29,382
One …

1020
01:38:30,052 --> 01:38:31,388
Two, Three, go.

1021
01:38:32,515 --> 01:38:34,311
In the name of God...

1022
01:38:36,941 --> 01:38:40,405
You should’ve waited
before serving the food.

1023
01:38:40,406 --> 01:38:42,743
We could watch the news first.

1024
01:38:42,744 --> 01:38:46,124
I didn’t want the rice to get
cold.

1025
01:38:46,125 --> 01:38:49,465
- Go ahead and eat.
- We could’ve had dinner 20
minutes later.

1026
01:38:49,466 --> 01:38:52,930
- I’ve already served. Please
eat.
- How come Shahaab’s going to be on TV?

1027
01:38:52,931 --> 01:38:56,646
- Is he an actor now?
- I don’t know. He said it’s an
interview.

1028
01:38:56,647 --> 01:38:59,987
- Hopefully it’s good news.
- Hurry, it’s starting.

1029
01:39:00,529 --> 01:39:01,782
I’m coming.

1030
01:39:05,999 --> 01:39:07,418
Take this.

1031
01:39:08,003 --> 01:39:09,380
It’s starting.

1032
01:39:09,381 --> 01:39:14,682
I, Shahaab Mansouri, and my
sister
Faezeh Mansouri, live in Pakistan.

1033
01:39:14,683 --> 01:39:20,235
We are spies. Our intention was
to spy
on Jundallah for the Iranian government.

1034
01:39:20,236 --> 01:39:23,950
- What’s going on?
- We came here to kill this
group’s fighters.

1035
01:39:23,951 --> 01:39:27,249
But thankfully we were captured.

1036
01:39:27,250 --> 01:39:31,633
- I repent and ask God’s
forgiveness.
- What’s going on?!

1037
01:39:34,472 --> 01:39:36,643
Oh lord! Oh God!

1038
01:39:37,102 --> 01:39:39,691
- It’s my son! It’s Shahaab!
- Oh God!

1039
01:39:40,234 --> 01:39:41,737
Oh God!

1040
01:39:48,584 --> 01:39:50,170
My son!

1041
01:39:51,172 --> 01:39:53,176
My son! Stop!

1042
01:39:53,427 --> 01:39:54,721
Stop!

1043
01:40:23,780 --> 01:40:25,324
Hello.

1044
01:40:29,291 --> 01:40:30,501
Where is he?

1045
01:40:32,380 --> 01:40:34,008
God save us.

1046
01:40:36,179 --> 01:40:39,977
What’ve you done?
Why did you kill him?!

1047
01:40:39,978 --> 01:40:42,316
How can I look at Faezeh now?

1048
01:40:42,317 --> 01:40:46,867
- You’ve committed a sin. You’re
cruel!
- What did you expect me to do?

1049
01:40:52,587 --> 01:40:56,051
The Baluch are good people.
They are honest.

1050
01:40:56,052 --> 01:41:01,355
You are evil!
You’re not one of us!

1051
01:41:13,545 --> 01:41:15,716
You took it out on him.

1052
01:41:16,676 --> 01:41:19,892
He wanted to come to Europe with
us.
He didn’t think this would happen to him.

1053
01:41:22,772 --> 01:41:24,817
You hated that family form the
start.

1054
01:41:25,778 --> 01:41:27,991
They gave me their daughter.

1055
01:41:28,199 --> 01:41:31,497
- That confession was your
excuse?
- Why do you keep defending them?

1056
01:41:31,498 --> 01:41:34,210
I’ve made you my
second-in-command.

1057
01:41:34,211 --> 01:41:36,383
You’re my replacement.

1058
01:41:36,633 --> 01:41:41,349
You want proof?
Shahaab had said he’d kill us.

1059
01:41:41,350 --> 01:41:44,482
He said he’ll rat us out.
I saved your life.

1060
01:41:45,025 --> 01:41:46,105
Do you still need a reason?

1061
01:41:47,154 --> 01:41:49,825
The hell with him, the bastard!
I’ll kill him.

1062
01:41:49,826 --> 01:41:52,121
- I swear I’ll kill him. Just
wait and see.
- Listen to me!

1063
01:41:52,122 --> 01:41:53,458
What did we ever do to them?

1064
01:41:53,459 --> 01:41:56,004
Was there an Abdol-Malek among
his brothers?

1065
01:41:56,005 --> 01:41:59,178
Run away.
Don’t stay there a minute
longer.

1066
01:41:59,471 --> 01:42:02,642
Don’t worry. Don’t worry
sweetheart.
I’ll take care of everything.

1067
01:42:02,643 --> 01:42:07,528
- I’ll go to the consulate.
- Don’t! They have many
supporters...

1068
01:42:33,872 --> 01:42:34,872
Hello.

1069
01:42:36,503 --> 01:42:37,505
Hi.

1070
01:42:44,185 --> 01:42:45,185
Hello.

1071
01:42:51,575 --> 01:42:54,246
Sweetheart!

1072
01:42:56,585 --> 01:42:59,298
I missed you!

1073
01:43:01,678 --> 01:43:03,724
My love!

1074
01:43:09,360 --> 01:43:10,721
You’re giving me the cold
shoulder?

1075
01:43:12,241 --> 01:43:16,791
It’s me, the one you used to
love.

1076
01:43:19,547 --> 01:43:21,676
You used to make me cards.
Remember?

1077
01:43:22,052 --> 01:43:23,096
Faezeh?

1078
01:43:25,225 --> 01:43:30,067
I love my life,
I love my wife, my children.

1079
01:43:30,068 --> 01:43:33,992
- I’m not cut out for Jihad.
- Stop lying!

1080
01:43:34,786 --> 01:43:37,916
I saw you in the film.
You were absorbed by Malek’s
words.

1081
01:43:37,917 --> 01:43:40,212
- I saw with my own eyes.
- I didn’t do anything. I swear.

1082
01:43:40,213 --> 01:43:43,009
I didn’t kill anyone.
I just went because Malek asked
me.

1083
01:43:43,010 --> 01:43:46,309
- It doesn’t make a difference.
- He ordered me to go.

1084
01:43:47,018 --> 01:43:49,021
Ordered you?
What’s that mean?

1085
01:43:49,022 --> 01:43:52,278
- Who does he think he is?
- He is the Amir. Everyone calls
him Amir.

1086
01:43:52,279 --> 01:43:56,119
- You participated in the
slaughter...
- No I didn’t. I swear.

1087
01:43:56,120 --> 01:44:00,085
- I didn’t do anything. I didn’t
kill anyone.
- I don’t understand Malek’s God.

1088
01:44:00,086 --> 01:44:01,715
We have grown distant from each
other.

1089
01:44:02,132 --> 01:44:05,848
You have grown distant from me,
from your life, from Islam, from
humanity.

1090
01:44:07,267 --> 01:44:10,482
- I am ashamed to love you
anymore...
- Please don’t say that!

1091
01:44:15,826 --> 01:44:19,540
Let me call my mom and
hear her voice.

1092
01:44:19,541 --> 01:44:21,336
Don’t worry them.

1093
01:44:21,337 --> 01:44:26,680
Don’t leave me alone
with these guards.

1094
01:44:26,681 --> 01:44:29,353
Let me leave.
Let me go back to Iran.

1095
01:44:30,188 --> 01:44:34,446
I don’t know how these babies
will turn out with what I’ve
been through!

1096
01:44:35,991 --> 01:44:37,703
Or just kill me and get it over
with.

1097
01:44:38,163 --> 01:44:40,834
Prove to your brother that
you’re no less than him.

1098
01:44:42,629 --> 01:44:48,139
Some of my brother’s guys
have American residency.

1099
01:44:48,140 --> 01:44:50,018
I’ve talked to them.

1100
01:44:50,019 --> 01:44:52,857
They’re going to help us go to
America.

1101
01:44:52,858 --> 01:44:57,242
- We’ll go away and live in
peace.
- You talk like a child.

1102
01:44:57,868 --> 01:45:01,710
I won’t be happy even in heaven.

1103
01:45:05,801 --> 01:45:08,013
If you really love me
come back to Iran with me.

1104
01:45:08,974 --> 01:45:11,437
Let’s go before your spill
any more innocent blood.

1105
01:45:12,314 --> 01:45:14,235
I’ll be executed in Iran,

1106
01:45:16,740 --> 01:45:18,326
with the things
Abdol-Malek has done,

1107
01:45:22,960 --> 01:45:25,966
I can’t stand this anymore!

1108
01:45:34,650 --> 01:45:37,447
4 months later

1109
01:45:41,747 --> 01:45:45,045
We can get here.
Is it good?

1110
01:45:45,046 --> 01:45:46,590
They have to be careful...

1111
01:46:21,870 --> 01:46:22,872
Be careful.

1112
01:46:57,148 --> 01:46:59,276
-Yes?
-I sent three teams of two to
Iran yesterday,

1113
01:46:59,277 --> 01:47:01,698
they were arrested by Iranian
Intelligence.

1114
01:47:01,699 --> 01:47:06,207
- Really? Will they give them
information?
- No they won’t.

1115
01:47:06,208 --> 01:47:08,545
Most are only working with us
for money.

1116
01:47:08,546 --> 01:47:10,717
- I use them as smugglers.
- They don’t believe...

1117
01:47:14,641 --> 01:47:18,231
- I think we have an informer.
- Why’re you telling me?

1118
01:47:18,232 --> 01:47:20,695
Maybe you think it’s me?

1119
01:47:23,409 --> 01:47:27,791
Are you pointing at her now?
She’s been locked in the house.

1120
01:47:27,792 --> 01:47:29,795
How can she give you away?

1121
01:47:29,796 --> 01:47:32,050
You killed her brother and
now it’s her turn?

1122
01:47:32,051 --> 01:47:33,887
She’s about to give birth!

1123
01:47:33,888 --> 01:47:37,394
I haven’t let her find out
about Shahaab or she’d die of
grief.

1124
01:47:37,395 --> 01:47:39,607
I won’t kill her. You will.

1125
01:47:39,608 --> 01:47:41,445
It’s an order.

1126
01:48:45,698 --> 01:48:47,285
We’ve been ambushed!
It’s an ambush!

1127
01:49:01,479 --> 01:49:02,941
Go!

1128
01:49:06,949 --> 01:49:08,243
Bastard!

1129
01:49:17,971 --> 01:49:19,099
Go!

1130
01:49:19,390 --> 01:49:21,103
Don’t let the government forces
in!

1131
01:49:48,824 --> 01:49:49,951
Abdol-Vahed hurry!

1132
01:49:50,703 --> 01:49:51,703
Hurry!

1133
01:49:53,709 --> 01:49:54,709
Go!

1134
01:49:59,429 --> 01:50:00,429
Bastards!

1135
01:50:02,393 --> 01:50:03,603
Infidels!

1136
01:50:12,246 --> 01:50:13,666
Abdol-Vahed!

1137
01:50:15,627 --> 01:50:16,797
No!

1138
01:50:23,185 --> 01:50:24,896
You killed him!

1139
01:51:21,676 --> 01:51:25,976
Jihad is for the obliteration of
governments that don’t follow
God’s laws.

1140
01:51:25,977 --> 01:51:28,481
Every government outside
Islam is infidel,

1141
01:51:28,482 --> 01:51:31,446
and its only path to salvation
is Jihad.

1142
01:51:32,030 --> 01:51:35,036
Muslims must never give up on
Jihad.

1143
01:51:35,287 --> 01:51:41,298
Friends sometimes ask,
why I violate, hang, decapitate.

1144
01:51:41,299 --> 01:51:46,016
The answer is we do all this to
draw
greater numbers of enemies to the field.

1145
01:51:46,017 --> 01:51:48,562
With more enemies
we can kill more people.

1146
01:51:48,563 --> 01:51:51,528
This will please God
and anger the infidels.

1147
01:51:54,116 --> 01:51:57,540
The ignorance now is
greater than it was before
Islam.

1148
01:52:00,003 --> 01:52:02,090
The world is filled with
corruption.

1149
01:52:03,009 --> 01:52:06,433
The world is filled with sin.

1150
01:52:07,267 --> 01:52:10,690
People commit sins without fear
of God.

1151
01:52:10,691 --> 01:52:13,196
We can either have a world
of sin or a world of Islam.

1152
01:52:14,198 --> 01:52:17,454
They cannot go side by side.
They are in complete
disagreement.

1153
01:52:17,455 --> 01:52:20,167
Muslims must fight infidelity
with all their might.

1154
01:52:20,168 --> 01:52:22,506
They must fight with their
beliefs.

1155
01:52:23,383 --> 01:52:26,389
Without purity,
God will abandon us.

1156
01:52:26,890 --> 01:52:29,311
And if God abandons us
victory will be difficult.

1157
01:52:31,190 --> 01:52:33,069
Don’t be afraid of martyrdom.

1158
01:52:34,405 --> 01:52:36,157
Don’t be afraid of death.

1159
01:52:36,158 --> 01:52:40,459
It is the moment when
you will join God and the
Prophet.

1160
01:52:44,467 --> 01:52:46,345
I have lost three brothers on
this path.

1161
01:52:48,182 --> 01:52:53,359
The last one, my youngest
brother
Abdol-Vahed, was martyred yesterday.

1162
01:53:11,187 --> 01:53:13,232
You left our brother behind?

1163
01:53:15,612 --> 01:53:16,812
Don’t say anything to Ghamnaz.

1164
01:53:18,076 --> 01:53:19,286
She shouldn’t find out.

1165
01:53:20,456 --> 01:53:21,791
What did you do to Noureddin?

1166
01:53:22,501 --> 01:53:24,021
What does one do
with an insubordinate?

1167
01:53:25,090 --> 01:53:26,509
I didn’t want to see him.

1168
01:53:28,930 --> 01:53:32,813
Blood is being shed every day
and we’re still asleep.

1169
01:53:34,233 --> 01:53:37,072
Abdol-Hamid, three people
want to meet me in Morocco.

1170
01:53:37,865 --> 01:53:39,868
No one knows I am going there.

1171
01:53:39,869 --> 01:53:42,832
I have told everyone that
you are in charge.

1172
01:53:42,833 --> 01:53:44,293
You are the commander.

1173
01:53:44,294 --> 01:53:46,591
I don’t have any other
brother that I trust.

1174
01:53:48,302 --> 01:53:53,271
After your children are born you
won’t
have an excuse for not killing their mother.

1175
01:53:57,946 --> 01:53:59,366
Is Saeed homesick?

1176
01:54:01,538 --> 01:54:05,045
- No, he’s not like you.
- I’ve made up my mind.

1177
01:54:05,921 --> 01:54:09,053
I’ll send Faezeh to Iran.
She’s the mother of my three
children.

1178
01:54:10,931 --> 01:54:11,974
I will forgive her.

1179
01:54:13,812 --> 01:54:15,356
She has information about us.

1180
01:54:16,400 --> 01:54:19,740
Once she gets to Iran we have
to wait to die at our home.

1181
01:54:19,990 --> 01:54:21,751
Your wife knows
you took part in my missions.

1182
01:54:22,120 --> 01:54:24,750
Just imagine if she finds out
we killed Shahaab.

1183
01:54:25,418 --> 01:54:27,339
She will want to kill you,
to destroy you.

1184
01:54:28,049 --> 01:54:31,012
Trust your Amir.
I only want your good.

1185
01:54:32,432 --> 01:54:33,432
Yes?

1186
01:54:34,186 --> 01:54:35,186
What?

1187
01:54:36,733 --> 01:54:37,733
When did they take her?

1188
01:54:38,402 --> 01:54:39,883
They’ve taken my wife to the
hospital.

1189
01:54:41,158 --> 01:54:42,158
No.

1190
01:54:43,872 --> 01:54:45,375
I’ll leave now.
Bye.

1191
01:54:45,709 --> 01:54:47,310
You can’t go anywhere today
and tomorrow.

1192
01:54:47,880 --> 01:54:51,303
We have lots to do.
Send Ghamnaz to be with your
wife.

1193
01:54:51,721 --> 01:54:54,977
Bring our mother back soon
so she doesn’t do anything.

1194
01:54:55,311 --> 01:54:57,440
Assign some men to guard the
hospital.

1195
01:55:18,482 --> 01:55:19,482
Ghamnaz!

1196
01:55:20,737 --> 01:55:23,201
I’m glad to see you.

1197
01:55:24,704 --> 01:55:28,211
- There’s no one else I can
trust.
- It’s okay.

1198
01:55:28,837 --> 01:55:31,217
Everything will be okay.

1199
01:55:32,135 --> 01:55:34,765
The babies are two months
premature.

1200
01:55:35,475 --> 01:55:38,940
But they’re okay.
They are in the incubator.

1201
01:55:39,775 --> 01:55:43,532
What news do you have?
Where did they take you and
Noureddin?

1202
01:55:46,121 --> 01:55:47,666
How is my son?

1203
01:55:49,002 --> 01:55:51,674
Noureddin’s disappeared.
They took him away.

1204
01:55:52,300 --> 01:55:55,556
But don’t worry about it.
Think about yourself.

1205
01:55:57,936 --> 01:56:00,692
They haven’t allowed me
to call anyone for months.

1206
01:56:01,235 --> 01:56:03,781
I couldn’t.
They took away my phone,

1207
01:56:03,782 --> 01:56:05,659
and my TV.

1208
01:56:05,660 --> 01:56:08,040
Can you give me my phone
so I can call my mom?

1209
01:56:08,499 --> 01:56:12,549
- To let her know how I am.
- I don’t have a phone. They took
mine too.

1210
01:56:16,682 --> 01:56:20,356
- Someone is waiting for you in
the lobby.
- I’ll be right there.

1211
01:56:23,612 --> 01:56:27,161
Please don’t go!
Can’t you stay?

1212
01:56:28,456 --> 01:56:30,125
No.

1213
01:56:30,543 --> 01:56:34,175
I’ve been here since last night.
They’re afraid to leave me with
you.

1214
01:56:37,933 --> 01:56:39,269
Why do you care about me so
much?

1215
01:56:40,730 --> 01:56:42,734
I never did anything for you.

1216
01:56:44,321 --> 01:56:45,601
You stood up to your son for me.

1217
01:56:47,535 --> 01:56:49,706
What’s wrong is wrong.

1218
01:56:50,082 --> 01:56:53,130
It doesn’t matter
if it’s your son or a stranger.

1219
01:56:53,589 --> 01:56:56,136
I feel shame toward you.

1220
01:56:57,555 --> 01:56:59,559
I didn’t do anything for you.

1221
01:56:59,810 --> 01:57:03,985
You were a guest but
I didn’t take care of you well.

1222
01:57:04,987 --> 01:57:06,490
I was a prisoner myself.

1223
01:57:06,908 --> 01:57:09,789
You’re the only reason
I haven’t tried to runaway from
here.

1224
01:57:23,023 --> 01:57:24,023
Yes?

1225
01:57:24,985 --> 01:57:25,985
Hi.

1226
01:57:28,868 --> 01:57:30,872
At dawn?

1227
01:57:33,752 --> 01:57:36,717
The children are in incubators?

1228
01:57:38,178 --> 01:57:41,059
I’ll come, tomorrow.

1229
01:58:36,086 --> 01:58:38,173
You have to change your room.

1230
01:58:39,175 --> 01:58:40,470
Get up on this.

1231
01:58:45,855 --> 01:58:48,819
- Where are you taking me?
- We’ll talk outside.

1232
01:58:59,674 --> 01:59:00,969
I’ve seen you before.

1233
01:59:05,435 --> 01:59:08,065
We have to get out first.
Then we’ll explain everything.

1234
01:59:08,066 --> 01:59:10,571
Don’t show any reaction.
There are cameras.

1235
01:59:14,913 --> 01:59:19,713
- What about my children?
- They have to stay in the
hospital.

1236
01:59:19,714 --> 01:59:23,305
I don’t understand.
You’re not bringing my children?

1237
01:59:27,104 --> 01:59:29,275
- You won’t bring my children?
- No.

1238
01:59:33,075 --> 01:59:37,749
Malek is going to kill you.
We’ve risked our lived to save
you.

1239
01:59:37,750 --> 01:59:41,465
- My children?! Sir?
- They won’t do anything to your
children.

1240
01:59:41,466 --> 01:59:44,471
Please be quiet, we’ll talk when
we
get out of here.

1241
01:59:44,472 --> 01:59:47,435
It was you in the bazaar that
day?

1242
01:59:47,436 --> 01:59:49,982
- We’ve been after them all this
time.
- You’re lying!

1243
01:59:49,983 --> 01:59:54,449
- Then why haven’t you captured
them?
- Abdol-Malek was at the pizza place you went.

1244
01:59:54,450 --> 01:59:56,662
- So why didn’t you do anything?
- I had him in view.

1245
01:59:56,663 --> 01:59:59,167
I don’t believe it!
Why didn’t you do anything?

1246
01:59:59,168 --> 02:00:03,551
- His brain would’ve splattered
all over his son.
- Why didn’t you tell me at Ghamnaz’s house?!

1247
02:00:03,552 --> 02:00:06,272
- I wouldn’t be here now if you’d
told me!
- I didn’t have permission.

1248
02:00:17,914 --> 02:00:20,460
I don’t want to leave my
children.

1249
02:00:23,759 --> 02:00:25,053
Be quiet!

1250
02:00:29,019 --> 02:00:31,316
Let me go!

1251
02:00:31,817 --> 02:00:33,611
My children!

1252
02:00:33,612 --> 02:00:37,077
- They’ll turn my children into
Bin Laden!
- Come when I tell you!

1253
02:00:39,498 --> 02:00:42,587
- Let’s go. Come!
- Take her behind the wall!

1254
02:00:42,588 --> 02:00:45,844
- Let me go!
- This is your last chance. Trust
me!

1255
02:00:45,845 --> 02:00:47,723
Let me go!

1256
02:00:47,724 --> 02:00:50,979
They won’t do anything to your
kids.
But they’ll kill you.

1257
02:00:50,980 --> 02:00:53,109
- Get up! Get up!
- Let me go!

1258
02:00:55,405 --> 02:00:57,659
- You’re not coming?
- She won’t come.

1259
02:00:57,660 --> 02:00:58,660
Leave her.

1260
02:00:59,538 --> 02:01:00,791
I didn’t want to tell you,

1261
02:01:02,670 --> 02:01:04,590
but they’ve killed Shahaab
and will kill you too.

1262
02:01:27,594 --> 02:01:28,596
Faezeh?

1263
02:01:29,766 --> 02:01:30,766
Faezeh?

1264
02:01:57,112 --> 02:02:00,869
The Iranian terrorist was
identified from the hospital
cameras.

1265
02:02:00,870 --> 02:02:02,663
I finally got them after 20
days.

1266
02:02:02,664 --> 02:02:05,294
His name is Ghodratollah
Khoda-Sefat.
A fake name.

1267
02:02:05,295 --> 02:02:07,090
He’s a sharpshooter.

1268
02:02:07,759 --> 02:02:10,095
He was captured in the war,
and they cut off his trigger
finger.

1269
02:02:10,096 --> 02:02:12,558
He entered Pakistan
with an Afghan passport.

1270
02:02:12,559 --> 02:02:14,898
The government
of Afghanistan says it is fake.

1271
02:02:17,193 --> 02:02:18,571
Look son.

1272
02:02:22,413 --> 02:02:23,415
Look.

1273
02:02:25,168 --> 02:02:26,168
Take it.

1274
02:02:26,546 --> 02:02:28,049
Watch and learn.

1275
02:02:49,968 --> 02:02:53,265
Faezeh didn’t accompany
the Iranian terrorists.

1276
02:02:53,516 --> 02:02:55,980
She stayed because she
wants to take revenge.

1277
02:02:56,982 --> 02:03:00,654
She doesn’t know anything about
Shahaab’s death.

1278
02:03:00,655 --> 02:03:04,913
We’ll all die when she finds
out.
Me, you, Ghamnaz.

1279
02:03:04,914 --> 02:03:09,213
- She is very dangerous.
- I know she stayed behind for
her children.

1280
02:03:09,214 --> 02:03:13,806
You are naïve
and will pay the price.

1281
02:03:14,350 --> 02:03:16,937
She will finally kill you.

1282
02:03:16,938 --> 02:03:19,484
I hope you have finally accepted
me.

1283
02:03:19,485 --> 02:03:21,364
Obey your Amir’s orders.

1284
02:03:21,656 --> 02:03:23,451
This is your obligation.

1285
02:03:24,453 --> 02:03:27,668
Are you worried about your
children losing their mother?

1286
02:03:28,294 --> 02:03:32,427
A true fighter has to sacrifice
everything,
his wife, children, belongings, everything.

1287
02:03:32,428 --> 02:03:35,683
God will provide you with the
best women in heaven.

1288
02:03:35,684 --> 02:03:38,022
Faezeh is an infidel.
You have married an infidel.

1289
02:03:38,272 --> 02:03:40,694
The enemy will inform on us all.
Don’t doubt this.

1290
02:03:41,111 --> 02:03:42,822
Her brother confessed.

1291
02:03:42,823 --> 02:03:47,540
I can take revenge on Faezeh,
but I want you to have the
blessing.

1292
02:03:47,541 --> 02:03:49,962
You deserve it.

1293
02:03:49,963 --> 02:03:52,842
A true fighter should
overcome his emotions.

1294
02:03:52,843 --> 02:03:55,139
You have to begin Jihad
on those closest to you.

1295
02:03:55,724 --> 02:03:58,438
I don’t want to call you an
outsider.

1296
02:03:59,941 --> 02:04:02,571
Today we will have a ceremony
for you.

1297
02:04:05,326 --> 02:04:06,621
Stop that!

1298
02:04:09,167 --> 02:04:12,716
I don’t want my
second-in-command
to show weakness.

1299
02:05:23,357 --> 02:05:26,070
I want to be alone
with Faezeh tonight.

1300
02:05:26,071 --> 02:05:29,286
Watch the children for a few
hours.

1301
02:05:34,838 --> 02:05:37,260
I’ve bought her a necklace.

1302
02:05:37,594 --> 02:05:39,013
Pearls.

1303
02:05:40,015 --> 02:05:44,650
For the twins she’s given me.
Let’s see if she’ll forgive me.

1304
02:06:00,932 --> 02:06:03,395
Abdol-Hamid I won’t forgive you.

1305
02:06:03,813 --> 02:06:06,275
- She is innocent.
- What’re you talking about? Stop
it.

1306
02:06:06,276 --> 02:06:09,030
Abdol-Majid has left our
religion.
Don’t listen to him.

1307
02:06:09,031 --> 02:06:12,163
You are older, better, wiser.
Don’t be fooled by him.

1308
02:06:12,748 --> 02:06:16,631
- He isn’t the Amir of dust, let
alone you and I.
- Let me go.

1309
02:06:17,173 --> 02:06:19,301
I want to be alone with
my wife.

1310
02:06:19,302 --> 02:06:22,809
She was pregnant, then she gave
birth,
and her 40 days are over now.

1311
02:06:26,024 --> 02:06:27,902
Can’t you see she won’t talk to
me?

1312
02:06:27,903 --> 02:06:30,699
She’s my wife.
The mother of my children.

1313
02:06:30,700 --> 02:06:33,580
She’s my life, my heart.
I went through hell to get her.

1314
02:06:34,541 --> 02:06:36,542
Forget about Abdol-Majid.
He can say what he wants.

1315
02:06:37,881 --> 02:06:39,133
I will send her to Iran.

1316
02:06:39,677 --> 02:06:41,595
I’m not crazy.

1317
02:06:41,596 --> 02:06:43,309
I’ll let her go.
Don’t worry.

1318
02:08:05,222 --> 02:08:06,809
Why are you so pale?

1319
02:08:19,250 --> 02:08:21,671
My lady doesn’t need this stuff.

1320
02:08:27,433 --> 02:08:29,437
But tonight that we’re alone,

1321
02:08:33,529 --> 02:08:35,157
she can be prettier.

1322
02:08:38,998 --> 02:08:40,501
Not so pale.

1323
02:08:52,859 --> 02:08:54,446
Pretty and glowing.

1324
02:09:02,795 --> 02:09:05,801
Faezeh, I have always done
the right things too late.

1325
02:09:10,060 --> 02:09:16,072
But I did emotional,
thoughtless things very early in
life.

1326
02:09:20,038 --> 02:09:21,959
See what I’ve bought you.

1327
02:09:28,722 --> 02:09:30,267
Do you like it?

1328
02:09:39,368 --> 02:09:42,542
Faezeh I hurt you very much.

1329
02:09:44,546 --> 02:09:45,546
Please forgive me.

1330
02:09:47,259 --> 02:09:50,140
But you know
where you belong, don’t you?

1331
02:09:51,518 --> 02:09:53,522
Where is it?

1332
02:09:55,317 --> 02:09:57,029
Show me.

1333
02:09:59,075 --> 02:10:00,786
Where is Shahaab?

1334
02:10:11,933 --> 02:10:13,353
Where is he?

1335
02:10:15,524 --> 02:10:19,365
Where is Shahaab?!

1336
02:10:20,117 --> 02:10:22,286
- Where is he?!
- It wasn’t my fault.

1337
02:10:22,287 --> 02:10:24,291
- Where is he?!
- It wasn’t my fault.

1338
02:10:26,295 --> 02:10:29,301
- Where is he?!
- It wasn’t my fault.

1339
02:10:29,594 --> 02:10:35,397
- Where is he?!
- I didn’t do anything! I swear!

1340
02:10:35,856 --> 02:10:38,529
- Where is he?
- Where is Shahaab?

1341
02:10:38,779 --> 02:10:42,368
- Where is he?
- I didn’t do anything!

1342
02:10:42,369 --> 02:10:44,956
- Shahaab! Shahaab!
- I swear I didn’t do anything!

1343
02:10:44,957 --> 02:10:47,378
- Shahaab! Shahaab!
- I swear I didn’t do anything!

1344
02:10:47,379 --> 02:10:49,049
- Shahaab! Shahaab!
- Please stop that!

1345
02:10:49,050 --> 02:10:51,345
Please!

1346
02:10:53,767 --> 02:10:56,648
Where is my brother? Where is
he?

1347
02:13:51,580 --> 02:13:56,673
Two months later Abdol-Malek
expelled
Abdol-Hamid from Jundallah. Abdol-Hamid

1348
02:13:56,674 --> 02:14:01,766
was arrested by Pakistani forces
in May 2008,
and handed to Iranian intelligence.

1349
02:14:01,767 --> 02:14:06,569
Abdol-Malek Rigi was arrested in
Iran’s air space
as he was flying from Dubai to Kyrgyzstan.

1350
02:14:18,175 --> 02:14:20,472

- Yes.
