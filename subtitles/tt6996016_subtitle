1
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:18,680
Arun.

2
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:22,930
Arun.

3
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,070
<<Calling bell>>

4
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:32,990
(Children singing song)

5
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:34,620
Arun.

6
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,310
That's cute.
Thank you.

7
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:10,440
Thank you so much.

8
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:12,650
Thank you.

9
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:14,970
What's all this Arun?

10
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:19,880
This is for you.

11
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,080
Oh! Oh my God.

12
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:24,550
Happy Anniversary, Pallavi.

13
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,580
Happy Anniversary.

14
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:32,220
Pallavi.
- Yeah.

15
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,400
Aren't you going to office today?

16
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,800
There's party in the evening.
II've got lots to do.

17
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:38,760
So, day off.
- (Laughs) Okay.

18
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,450
Bye Pallavi.
- Bye.

19
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:52,790
<<Phone ringing>>

20
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,420
Hello.
- Pallavi.

21
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,350
Yes, Arun?
- Did you come out?

22
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,310
Going to the mart to pick up groceries.
- Okay.

23
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:05,570
Actually... my office staff
will be attending the party.

24
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:08,060
Make necessary arrangements
ffor them as well.

25
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,670
Yeah, Arun. I'll take care of it.
- Okay Pallavi.

26
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:24,990
Is Uma here?
- Yes, he is here.

27
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,340
Uma.. Uma..

28
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:44,770
Uma..

29
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:11,460
Pallavi.

30
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:20,020
I knew you would come for me.

31
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,420
( Person talking in distance )

32
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:27,980
We should start from here.

33
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:30,270
Just a minute.

34
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,240
Stop. Stop.

35
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,360
Here. Take the money.

36
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,500
Good morning, Ma'am.
- Good morning.

37
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:11,750
Ma'am.

38
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,150
Pallavi, get out!

39
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:17,180
Sorry, ma'am. I was reminded of it
oon the way.

40
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,570
I got late by the time I went home
tto pick up the plate.

41
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:22,420
Plate isn't important.
The tempo is important.

42
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,150
You have no rhythm,
I told you several times.

43
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:28,190
Please, ma'am. Give me one chance.

44
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,410
Last chance.

45
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:47,990
Sorry.

46
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,170
Hey!
- Sorry. sorry.

47
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,480
Sorry.
- Get out.

48
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:21,810
Do we really need to dance?

49
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:24,480
We are eventually
going to get married and settle down.

50
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,980
Are you going to do stage shows
in the future?

51
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,600
Hey! It's not about the stage shows.

52
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,240
I want to make a CD
of my dance performances.

53
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:35,540
In the future when my husband
and kids watch my dance of TV,

54
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:38,330
The spark in their eyes..
- A spark?

55
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,550
It would be amazing.

56
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,250
You know, every person
must have some memory in their life.

57
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:45,850
If not classical, I will do folk dance..

58
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:48,190
But I surely will.
- I'll kill you!

59
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,610
I don't like the idea
of my wife dancing.

60
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:56,040
I am not your wife. My life..
- Shut up!

61
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,170
If I see you participating
in dance and games in college..

62
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,200
What will you do?

63
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:07,800
You will see a violent me. Be careful.

64
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,230
Just to teach him a lesson,
I must learn dance.

65
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:21,290
Where can we find
a dance teacher now?

66
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:23,630
I am my faith in
'Simhadri Appanna' The almighty.

67
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,460
We found our master.
- What?

68
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:17,300
Sir, you always kept mentioning
your favourite student Uma Maheshwar Rao.

69
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:19,440
Did you see his dance?

70
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,240
Hey, what ever he does is at the top most.

71
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:25,940
He was always first in studies and dance.

72
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:30,090
Let him finish his PhD,
you guys would be jealous of his settlement.

73
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,100
Hold it.

74
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,800
Mix it off.
- They may find out.

75
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:39,520
No one will find out.
- Uma!

76
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:42,960
What's up, Uma? Will you
just keep dancing at weddings?

77
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:46,250
Do you have plans for yourself?
- Your husband is calling you.

78
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,400
She proposed to twice while pursuing MCA.
- Did she?

79
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:51,850
She's takes me for granted
because I rejected her.

80
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,740
You rejected her?
- Hey! Why are you so shocked for everything?

81
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:56,310
What say, Puma?
- Sir.

82
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,040
It is P. Uma!
- I said the same.

83
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:03,090
Hmmm... looks like you're enjoying!
- Enjoyment?

84
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:04,570
'Struggles for making a living.'

85
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,310
When will I get my PhD?
When will I settle down?

86
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:10,050
You can put up a food truck
and also settle down.

87
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:13,410
But one must settle down
like Uma Maheswar Rao.

88
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,170
Have some patience.

89
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:20,200
Heard that you didn't pay the bills.
- You didn't pay?

90
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,080
My checkbook is all wet.

91
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:25,900
Gate crash into weddings for food
and seek refuge at bus stops,

92
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:27,020
Spend time happily.

93
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,790
How can a Godfather say that, sir?

94
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:31,240
I am your Godfather.

95
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,980
Had I been your father,
I'd have ripped your skin off.

96
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,230
You will enter the hostel
only after paying the fee. Tell him.

97
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,450
Only after paying the fee,
you will enter the hostel.

98
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:41,890
It seems.
- Mix it.

99
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,150
Hey look! he is over there.
- Let's go.

100
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,660
Master! bless me.
- God bless you, my child.

101
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:51,750
Who are you?
Who do you think I am?

102
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,770
I'm Pallavi. Gitam college student.

103
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:56,090
I must perform a dance
at my college's event in three days.

104
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,940
I just saw you dancing,
You were amazing.

105
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:02,330
You are my dance master from today.

106
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:07,050
My dream will come true
if you teach me dancing.

107
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:09,170
I can't give up on my work
to make your dream come true.

108
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:12,860
You don't have to teach me for free.
You can take a fee.

109
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:13,900
Fee? How much?

110
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,840
We must pay food bill...
ask for 1000 bucks!

111
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:17,580
5000.

112
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:19,830
Hey, I said 500.

113
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:24,520
Okay done.
It's not about the money.

114
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:29,140
If I help one realize their dream,
I will also realize Kalam's dream.

115
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:30,610
Master.

116
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,380
Thank you.
- Alright, give us some advance.

117
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:34,660
We are very professional.

118
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:36,990
You have to train first,
we are very practical.

119
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:37,800
Which place?

120
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,080
Hello, what is this?

121
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,000
Ours is not a romantic song,
it's a mass song.

122
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:48,120
Hey, turn it on!
- Okay.

123
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:50,780
You will pay, right?
- Damn you! switch it on.

124
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,160
Are you ready?
- Okay.

125
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,530
Okay, let's do it.

126
00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:09,610
(Mass song in background)

127
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:14,130
Super! You can't dance with claps.
you must dance.

128
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,000
I will do master.
- Then..

129
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,330
What about the movement?
- I got it.

130
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:19,880
Yeah. Ready.

131
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:37,180
(Mass song in the background)

132
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,010
Stop.

133
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:42,170
What are you doing?

134
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:44,410
When you shake your head,
it has to be only your head.

135
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,860
The same with waist.

136
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:49,620
If you move your entire body
it looks like epilepsy.

137
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,210
What do we do now?

138
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:55,940
What did you say, master?

139
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:58,700
Move your head only...
- Master, I have an idea.

140
00:15:58,910 --> 00:15:59,400
What is your idea?

141
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,910
When I move my waist,
hold my head.

142
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:05,160
When I move my head,
hold my waist.

143
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,750
This will work out master.

144
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:08,450
Unexpected movement.

145
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,040
Hey Pallavi, are you crazy?

146
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,200
Shut up.
- Hey, Kalamandir Kavitha sit down.

147
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:16,660
I don't touch waists like this.
we are very professional men.

148
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:18,960
Master, you are not touching me.

149
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:22,630
It's just that the dancing hero in you
is touching the dancing queen in me.

150
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,140
What?
- Dancing hero.

151
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:27,370
Switch it on.
- Start.

152
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:28,520
Sound!

153
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,650
See, my waist is shaking.
- Hold my waist. I'll try.

154
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:47,850
This is fine, master.

155
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,660
Hold my head now.
I'll try the next step.

156
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,260
Did he connect to her?

157
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,460
Master, hold my head not shoulders.

158
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:03,540
I'm getting it.

159
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:07,160
Is that fine?

160
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:09,150
Is that fine?

161
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:11,200
What happened, master?

162
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,000
Breathe.

163
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:14,970
Breathe while dancing.
- Oh.

164
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,210
I'll try again.

165
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:22,870
There it's happening again.

166
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,430
Master, I can't do this.
- You will learn.

167
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,510
I got it.
I could feel it.

168
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:29,610
You will feel it soon.

169
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:34,080
Just because I refused you in college?
you came to the roads.

170
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,730
I told you, right?
I hate to see my wife dance.

171
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:37,990
Who is he?

172
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,840
My master.
- Which school?

173
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:41,780
Hey!
- Hey.

174
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,880
Go home and learn some cooking.

175
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,180
Have some control.

176
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,060
What is this?

177
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:55,000
You never told me
that you are married.

178
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:57,050
I thought...
- Damn!

179
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,560
I can never be his wife.

180
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:02,240
He's my super senior
from college.

181
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:04,650
He asked me to act like his wife
when he ragged me.

182
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,710
Since then he calls me his wife.

183
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:10,420
He's torturing me from past three years.

184
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,260
Why do you keep calm?

185
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,580
Oh no, I am scared
to look into his eyes. 186

186
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:17,070
I will help you fight your fear.

187
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:20,170
Call him to Tenneti Park in the morning.

188
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:21,930
And then?

189
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:23,790
I will take care of him.

190
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,270
Why are you so late, master.
That Manohar will be here any minute.

191
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,270
I am very tensed.

192
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:42,020
Do we have a plan?
- A plan?

193
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:45,290
Look there.

194
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:50,500
Seethammadhara S.I.
- S.I ?

195
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,290
There is one more guy
near the sugarcane truck.

196
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,940
Maddilapalem Head Constable.

197
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:07,990
Do you see ladies
on to your left. - Yes.

198
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,290
Yes.
- They are not ladies.

199
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,680
Don't stare at them.

200
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:17,240
'SHE' team.

201
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,480
Oh... - Do you see
a guy jogging in front of you.

202
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,120
Madhurwada C.I

203
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,850
They have information
on eve teasing happening here.

204
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,000
I get it now, master.

205
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,270
Undercover operation.

206
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:37,070
They are all going to deal
with Manohar now.

207
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:37,850
Correct.

208
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:41,990
For that to happen,
he must just touch you once.

209
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:43,930
You must make him touch you.

210
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,790
Provoke him.

211
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,080
Me?

212
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:48,690
I can't do it.

213
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,360
Master, he's coming.

214
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:55,840
You can do it.

215
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,140
Kill him.
- Master, you should stay here.

216
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,210
We are all here.
- Please. please.

217
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:05,070
Master.

218
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,580
You asked me to come alone,
if I am a man. I am here!

219
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,940
What will you do, huh?
What will you do?

220
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,280
Why are you over acting?

221
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,130
What are you looking around?

222
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:27,890
I'm talking to you.

223
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,550
Speak to me.

224
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:34,430
Why aren't you talking?
- What?

225
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,360
Yes.

226
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,630
I will talk now.
What will you do?

227
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,600
Do you think I am scared of you?

228
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,390
I dare you to touch me.

229
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,070
Just touch me for once.

230
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:51,440
Why are you stepping back43

231
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:54,350
Touch me. - Looks like
she's come here with a plan.

232
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:55,380
Just touch me for once.

233
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:57,680
Let's deal with her later.
- Where are you going?

234
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:00,540
I dare you to touch me.

235
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:01,910
Coward!
48.

236
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:06,280
Master, did you see that?
- Yes.

237
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:09,530
He's scared of me.
I could see it in his eyes.

238
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:12,240
I want to thank the cops.
- Cops?

239
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:14,310
They aren't cops.

240
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,170
They come here
regularly for jogging and work.

241
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:20,030
Master.
- You were scared till now.

242
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:22,720
You scared him off now.

243
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:27,230
Do you understand what you have now?

244
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:30,770
COURAGE.
- It's in you.

245
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:33,680
I said those things to you,
as you will be courageous. That's it.

246
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:39,210
Thank you master.

247
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:42,350
Thank you.

248
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:26,530
"Heartbeat suddenly begins pacing up"

249
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:34,610
"Who is that it came across?
Happiness fills up the relation"

250
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,980
"When did this bond form?"

251
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:46,130
"Is it really me with you?"

252
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:54,450
"Is it really happening as I feel like
As the girl I like applauds me"

253
00:22:54,800 --> 00:23:02,840
"She hugs me away with pleasure"

254
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:10,710
"She took into a world
Where I have never seen stars earlier"

255
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:18,680
"Heartbeat suddenly begins pacing up
Who is that it came across?"

256
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:26,210
"Happiness fills up the relation
When did this bond form"

257
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,310
Bye.
- Uma.

258
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:57,580
What?

259
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:00,090
The courage you ignited in me
is so amazing..

260
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:03,610
Wonder how it would be
having you in my life.

261
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:29,460
So, campus holidays start tomorrow.
Hostel will be closed.

262
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:32,580
My friend runs an EAMCET coaching
center in Hyderabad.

263
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:34,790
If you teach there in summer,
you may earn up to 25 grand.

264
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:37,040
You can use it for
next semester's expenses. Go!

265
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:37,940
No sir.

266
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:40,780
I can't go away from Vizag.
- Who is the girl?

267
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:41,430
Pallavi.

268
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:48,730
I've seen lot of Puma's like you
in this university. sit down.

269
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:53,240
What can I do when I ask you to progress
and you decide to fall in Love.

270
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:56,310
So, What's your next plan, sir?

271
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:58,950
I'll take a room for rent
and teach here itself.

272
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:01,720
'When luck wants to take you ahead,
brain drags you backwards.'

273
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,180
There is no one who would rent
a space for bachelors in Vizag?

274
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:12,290
Rajeshwari I told you so many times
to turn the cooker off after three whistles.

275
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:14,020
It's waste of gas.
- I forgot, dear.

276
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:18,700
Coffee dear.
- Father-in-law.

277
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,820
I told you to give the money to the dealer
from Ramana. I am checking on that.

278
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:23,860
I didn't, father-in-law.
- Why?

279
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:26,660
We take money on Friday
but we don't give, right?

280
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:27,520
Correct.

281
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,130
I got some marks.

282
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:43,040
What is this?
- A love letter father.

283
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,650
What? Who gave it to you?

284
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:47,250
The bachelor staying on terrace.

285
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:49,110
Really?

286
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:53,090
Lovababu.

287
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,630
You are not just using the room
but my wi-fi also..

288
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:56,930
Is it your will and wish?
- I didn't use it, sir.

289
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,250
You wrote a love letter to my daughter?
- On a Friday!

290
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:02,830
I thought he was a nice guy...
- All bachelors are not the same.

291
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,790
Why would I write a love letter.
I treat her like my cousin sister.

292
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:07,630
Why can't you think of her as a sibling?

293
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:09,390
You can judge his cunning mind here.
- yes.

294
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:12,410
Throw him out..
- I can't even write a leave letter, sir.

295
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:14,580
If you are still here my Father-in-law
will change your fate.

296
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:16,300
Sir, please.

297
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:22,320
Father, I always told you
not to give space to a bachelor.

298
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:27,270
You don't understand.
- It's not a palace for a family to stay.

299
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:30,410
Just a pent house.
That's how he must have thought!

300
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:41,100
Sir!

301
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,720
I saw a vacant flat yesterday and called you.
- You called me?

302
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:48,550
Here.

303
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:51,760
Yesterday..
- What's your name?

304
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,390
Uma Maheshwar rao.
- Good.

305
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:56,710
What do you do?
- PhD in Statistics.

306
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:59,490
Andhra University.
- Statistics?

307
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,650
Calculations I mean...

308
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:08,160
You are pursuing PhD, right?
That's not a job.

309
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:11,260
What's your source of income then?
I mean how?

310
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,600
I get scholarships, sir.

311
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:15,300
And I take tutions on free days.

312
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:16,320
Tutions!

313
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,250
Tutions?
- That sounds good.

314
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:21,100
I have a grandson.
He hates studying.

315
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,360
You must teach him for free..
- Sure.

316
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,520
Until the PhD is done with.
- Sure.

317
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,640
Until I finish my PhD, right?
- Until he finishes his PhD.

318
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:36,810
Come I'll show you the house.
I'll see you soon.

319
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,250
Please. - Come on.
- Coming sir.

320
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:48,830
Girlfriend and cousin sisters
won't come home, right?

321
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:51,930
I am not a 'Romeo' type of guy.
I am a 'Gentleman' sir.

322
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:53,100
Everyone would tell you the same.

323
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,820
Lovababu..
- Father-in-law.

324
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,330
Come on in.
- New bachelor.

325
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:10,360
Tell him the rules and regulations
and show him the pent house.

326
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:11,960
Go.
- Thanks sir.

327
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:16,970
Listen, it is not about connecting with him,
it is about not disconnecting with him.

328
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:20,200
You must be very lucky
to get space in our pent house.

329
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,650
How much did he tell you the rent is?
- Six thousand, he said.

330
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,580
It would cost eight thousand with taxes.
- Taxes?

331
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:25,570
Freedom tax.

332
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:29,510
There's a toll gate between
you and my uncle.

333
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:30,880
I will be opening it.

334
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:33,290
If you get beers home,
I must open it..

335
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,350
Girlfriends too. I have to lift.

336
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,130
For you to open the gates
I must pay you two grand.

337
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:38,320
Every month?
- Obviously.

338
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,840
Look, this is just between us.
- What matter?

339
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,970
Smart fellow.
- Pent house is amazing, sir.

340
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:45,500
What about my two grand?
- I'll give you in two days.

341
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,450
Give me your hand.

342
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:48,580
Thank you, sir.

343
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:54,590
Father, why did you rent
the space to a bachelor again?

344
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:55,920
The one who left
gave me a love letter, right?

345
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,960
But he's not even the type
who would take one if you give.

346
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,840
He's going to take tutions
for Chintu at free of cost.

347
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:02,740
He is well calculated.

348
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,810
He's comfortable with me as well.
- Who is asking you?

349
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:06,960
Lost my marks.

350
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:09,440
We just got one guy vacated yesterday.

351
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,430
Are all bachelors are not the same.
- Okay.

352
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,820
You like him, right?

353
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,000
My dear.

354
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:19,410
Yes!

355
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:21,830
Careful, that's our penthouse.

356
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:23,550
Wonderful.

357
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:25,600
Who is this guy?

358
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,130
Good morning sir.
- You said things.

359
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:28,120
This is it?

360
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:29,760
I'm staying alone,
why do I need this waste expense?

361
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:32,930
According to the law...
- Enough.

362
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:36,310
He will have his calculations.
- Yes, calculations.

363
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:36,940
Go.

364
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,460
One minute.

365
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,230
Who is he?
- A friend.

366
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:42,990
What do you mean by friend?
- We share everything.

367
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,280
Even bad luck?
- Anyone would share a biryani.

368
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:48,070
A true friend will also share bad luck.
I am true friend of him.

369
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:49,730
He looks like a black ticket guy.

370
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:51,920
Why do you have friends like him?
- Cut him lose.

371
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,550
Whom are you talking about?
- Him.

372
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:54,180
Who is he?

373
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:56,240
Oh... is it done like this?

374
00:29:57,450 --> 00:29:59,460
Go. Come to the campus.

375
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:03,220
You carry on. You can use
the old bachelors things.

376
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:05,640
Lovababu, please bring them.

377
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,150
Me?

378
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:07,820
Don't want 2000?
- Yes, I'll lift.

379
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:14,860
If there is a song, Pallavi might come.

380
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,040
Son.
- Son?

381
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:18,370
Over here.
- Where?

382
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:19,700
Here.
195.

383
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:22,530
Oh... Aunty.
- Whats your name?

384
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:23,620
Uma Maheshwar Rao, aunt.

385
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:26,840
Unlike the previous bachelor,
please be well behaved.

386
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:31,240
Whoever rents space
at our place becomes family.

387
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,060
You should feel that way.
- Completely.

388
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:38,390
Make sure you get these savories
and baskets downstairs when it rains.

389
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:40,690
I can't come up due to Arthritis.

390
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:43,330
Don't hesitate to bring
sarees and blouses.

391
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,140
Sarees and blouses?

392
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:47,670
When the tank is full,
come down and switch off the motor.

393
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,290
What is wrong with you?
Even you have arthritis?

394
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,170
What did you say, son?
- I will come down anytime.

395
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:55,930
You must be like family.
- You will see it for yourself.

396
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:57,400
Let's go.

397
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,410
Is everyone downstairs, aunty?

398
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,290
Today is Sunday, right?
Everyone is home.

399
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:03,200
That's it, right?

400
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:08,290
It's his first day, right?
do you have anything to eat?

401
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:11,690
That is... get it from a hotel.

402
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:14,060
There's Hotel Mayuri right next to the house.
It is amazing.

403
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,820
You must try it.
- It's very good son.

404
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,350
Go quick.
- Ok, Grandmother.

405
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:21,340
Master.

406
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,460
Shall we start tutions?
- Go away.

407
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,930
When will I finish my PhD
in that case?

408
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,090
PhD is not calk walk.

409
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:37,940
One must be hardworking and dedicated.
- Don't you want the house?

410
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,500
Let's start in the evening.
- Sharp at Six.

411
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,080
I should puncture this fellow.

412
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,470
You like the house?
- Why wouldn't I like it?

413
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:07,610
In-laws house after all.

414
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,940
Eat cashew porridge and text me.

415
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:22,890
"Which thread has pulled me along?"

416
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:30,800
"With you by my side,
my heart feels elated"

417
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:35,330
"This wasnÃƒÂ¢t something I asked for"

418
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,300
"It is a gift I found by myself"

419
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:43,150
"Every second is a celebration now"

420
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:51,430
"The dream I wished for
has now reached me like you"

421
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:59,870
"She hugs me away with pleasure"

422
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:07,810
"She took into a world
Where I have never seen stars earlier"

423
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:31,030
"Half of happiness and half of surprise"

424
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:38,870
"This truth somehow feels really good"

425
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:47,380
"With time as the witness
Life moves along as love"

426
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:59,020
"My journey now turns precious
No matter which direction I take"

427
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:07,610
"Heartbeat suddenly begins pacing up
Who is that it came across?"

428
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:15,070
"Happiness fills up the relation
When did this bond form?"

429
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:23,240
"Is it really me with you?"

430
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:31,160
'Is it really happening as I feel like"

431
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:39,890
"She hugs me away with pleasure"

432
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:47,890
"She took into a world
Where I have never seen stars earlier"

433
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:50,870
Where is the bike?
- Bike is not here.

434
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:55,750
Sorry.
- Why are you apologizing.

435
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:57,370
Let it be.

436
00:34:58,780 --> 00:34:59,640
We'll buy a car after we get married.

437
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:02,190
For now let's use Auto. come on.

438
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:07,700
Lovababu.. I asked him to sell
the papers every month..

439
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:09,720
Irresponsible fellow.

440
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:11,860
Hey dear.

441
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:13,950
Why are you drenched?

442
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:16,720
It's not even raining.

443
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:18,470
What is this, dad?

444
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,000
If it is not raining in MVP colony
doesn't mean it won't rain anywhere.

445
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,020
There's heavy rainfall in Akkayapalem.

446
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,200
Got drenched while coming back
from Kavita's place.

447
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:27,790
Is it?
- yes.

448
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,150
Go and dry yourself up.

449
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:30,910
Okay, father.

450
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:33,900
It's raining there and not here..

451
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:36,310
Hey... wait.

452
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:46,280
Sir.
- Are you coming from Akkayapalem?

453
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:50,860
Yes sir, how did you know?

454
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,620
It is raining very heavily, right?
- Major storm, sir.

455
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:54,970
But how did you know.

456
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:57,060
Carry on.

457
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:00,680
Sir.

458
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,560
Looks like you are calculating
climate as well..

459
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,470
Good night, sir.
- Good night.

460
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:18,340
<<Phone ringing>>

461
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:20,970
Pallavi.
- How long should I wait.

462
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,290
Sorry, I'll be there in five minutes.

463
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,290
Come soon.
- Okay, bye.

464
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:30,240
Where is Murthy?
- In his chamber.

465
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:32,200
Did you check it.
- Yes, I checked.

466
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:07,310
<<Phone ringing>>

467
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:25,100
<<Phone ringing>>

468
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:27,850
Hello, Uma.
- I reached where are you?

469
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:29,390
I saw the guys who stole my bike.
- Where?

470
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,460
They are on the harbor road.

471
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,800
I'm following them. Come soon.
- Pallavi, don't go.

472
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:51,250
Why didn't you change registration plate.
- I wanted to change after you see the bike.

473
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,440
Is the condition of the bike good?
- Hello.

474
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:55,390
This is our bike.

475
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,980
Do you have RC book, license?

476
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:05,760
If you show them all.
I will give it.

477
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:08,060
Shut up!
- It's okay show me.

478
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,230
He's asking, right?
Show him.

479
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,100
Show me.

480
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,820
Let's go from here.
- Where?

481
00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:22,490
I can take my bike, let's go.
- It's right here Uma.

482
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:25,930
Not here.
- Uma, that's our bike.

483
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:27,430
Can it carry four people?

484
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:35,820
Sit.

485
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:49,130
Hold it.

486
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,290
It will break.

487
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,370
What did you say?
- He asked can it pulll four?

488
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,720
Why do you talk about
mileage with girls.

489
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:19,390
Men should talk about them.
- Talk with you?

490
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:49,600
Don't you think before doing anything?

491
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:53,040
What if something happened to you?

492
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:54,590
Let the bike be.
- Why?

493
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:57,200
This is the bike we went out on.

494
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:58,750
It's our memory, Uma.

495
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,850
After our wedding, you must take me
and our kids on this bike.

496
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:06,940
Why are you laughing?

497
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:10,090
When will you grow up?
When will I marry you.

498
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:12,730
When will we have kids?
It will take a lot of time.

499
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:13,650
What do you mean?

500
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,420
What do you mean?

501
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:18,210
You think I am a kid?
- Did I say you are a kid?

502
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:21,530
I'm just saying you have to grow up.
- Why Uma..

503
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:23,100
Look at your face.

504
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:35,750
So you are here.

505
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:37,780
What is this Padma doing?

506
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:41,380
They married her off
after intermediate.

507
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,620
What does the guy do?

508
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:44,440
He's a pilot...
- Then what.

509
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,500
If the guy is good enough,
age doesn't matter.

510
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:52,070
You were 16 when I married you...
What happened to you?

511
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:53,160
You are living life queen size.

512
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:54,730
Even I will look after your
daughter like that.

513
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:56,110
She is happy too.

514
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,530
Had you settled a bit and got married,
it would have been better.

515
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:03,060
Every one was asking at the wedding.

516
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,930
When we are getting
our younger one married.

517
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:06,140
I am on a look out..

518
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:09,360
What is he doing? How much
ddoes he earn? Is it a permanent job?

519
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:10,490
There's lot to look into.

520
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:15,330
If our neighbour or tenant ask,
shall we give her away?

521
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:17,350
How can we do that?

522
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:20,740
Our Pallavi will get a good match.

523
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,160
Play the game, aunt.

524
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,050
Uma.

525
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:29,940
I was about to call you...
- Sir.

526
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:35,050
Prof. Chatterjee from Delhi's JNU just called...
He is impressed.

527
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:36,100
He's asking you to come to Delhi.

528
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:39,420
If you do your thesis under him,
the credibility for your PhD gets stronger.

529
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:40,530
Start to Delhi immediately.

530
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:43,640
<<Phone ringing>>

531
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:45,050
Pallavi.

532
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:53,940
Pallavi, I have to tell you something.
- I too have something to tell you.

533
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,150
I'm coming.

534
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:58,220
Why don't you think once.
- I already thought a lot about it.

535
00:41:58,770 --> 00:41:59,680
Why is everyone so serious?

536
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:00,950
I have a good news.

537
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:03,460
Murthy..
- Let's marry Uma.

538
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:10,090
They are discussing about
my wedding at home.

539
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:12,870
They are looking for proposals from the US.

540
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:16,040
They surely will not
let me get married to you.

541
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:19,470
We'll go some where and get married.

542
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:20,510
We shall, Pallavi.

543
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:22,350
But, so suddenly?

544
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,990
What is the need to elope
and get married?

545
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:27,160
If I elope with you,
they will be mad at me.

546
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,060
If I elope after the match making
or during the wedding,

547
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:31,110
They will blame my family.

548
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:32,440
I don't like that.

549
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:33,940
But..

550
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:36,470
How do we get married now.
- Uma.

551
00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:40,110
I won't ask you where and how.

552
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:43,700
I just need your love.

553
00:42:45,330 --> 00:42:46,870
Let's think for a week.
- No.

554
00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:48,200
We'll leave tomorrow.

555
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:51,430
Don't worry about the money,
I'll take care of it.

556
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,540
What are you thinking about?

557
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:03,000
Do you actually want to get married?

558
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:10,300
Let's get married.

559
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:17,280
I love you, Uma.

560
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:19,150
I love you.

561
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:22,000
Go... Why are you so slow?

562
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,420
Hey Uma...
Uma.

563
00:43:27,290 --> 00:43:27,890
Are you going home?

564
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,860
Yes sir.
- Good, let's go.

565
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,590
As the clock ticks 1 o'clock I feel hungry.

566
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:37,670
Are you coming from university.
- Yes sir.

567
00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:42,820
Our family is planning to go
to Tirupati next week.

568
00:43:42,930 --> 00:43:43,990
Why don't you come along?

569
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,990
Planning to go after the wedding, sir.

570
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:50,540
That's a good calculation.
Good. Good.

571
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,740
Looks like a fight. Pull over.

572
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:00,820
What are you talking?
111.

573
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:03,790
Don't shout. Talk normally.
- There's nothing to talk.

574
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:06,230
If you don't leave right now,
we'll lodge a complaint at the police station.

575
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,070
Let's go to the station and finalize then.
- What happened, Damu. Who is he?

576
00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:10,650
He is in love with Bindu.

577
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,750
If I don't get Bindu married to him
- She is also in love with me. Ask her.

578
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:18,170
Son, Loving someone is not wrong.

579
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:20,680
Asking for the girl like this is wrong.

580
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:23,130
What do you do?
- I am pursuing my degree.

581
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:24,200
Degree?

582
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:26,570
How will you look after her
with a degree?

583
00:44:26,850 --> 00:44:28,190
I will ride a rick and feed her, sir.

584
00:44:28,450 --> 00:44:30,080
You will ride a rick?

585
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:33,970
Do you have any idea as to
how he raised his daughter?

586
00:44:36,530 --> 00:44:39,350
He made her study
in best schools and best colleges.

587
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:43,560
He arranged for split AC at home
during her board exams.

588
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:44,440
Can you do that?

589
00:44:46,210 --> 00:44:49,370
If you ride a rick
you won't even get a table fan.

590
00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:51,100
We don't need all that, uncle.

591
00:44:52,530 --> 00:44:53,580
It's easy to say that now.

592
00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:55,870
But after the wedding..

593
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:59,650
if you feel like going for a movie or shopping,
you'll have to think several times.

594
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:06,590
If something goes wrong,
you will turn to this house.

595
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:09,920
Just say that you have issue with my caste
and not beat around the bush.

596
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:11,140
Just shut up I say.

597
00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:13,970
We don't care about
your caste and background.

598
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:16,980
Will you be able to take care of her
or not is what matters to us?

599
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:20,490
We always think of marrying
our daughter to an eligible guy.

600
00:45:21,290 --> 00:45:25,240
That's when you come into picture.
Only in the name of love.

601
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:28,130
You will have kids and make them suffer.

602
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:32,240
A generation's future goes down the drain.

603
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:37,210
If we are sure that you can take care
of our daughter better than us,

604
00:45:37,810 --> 00:45:41,660
We wouldn't mind even if she elopes.
We will rest peacefully here.

605
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,370
You are not of that stature. So, leave.

606
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:48,220
I know how to deal with this.
- Let's go.

607
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:50,220
Do what ever you can.

608
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:54,470
I'll see you then.
- Okay.

609
00:45:57,370 --> 00:45:58,740
Look how today's generation is.

610
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:02,700
An educated person like you
would understand.

611
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:05,240
Let's go. Useless fellow.

612
00:46:19,330 --> 00:46:20,020
Is everything alright?

613
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,510
'If we are sure that you can take care
of our daughter better than us'

614
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:36,570
'We wouldn't mind even if she elopes.
We will rest peacefully here.'

615
00:46:49,590 --> 00:46:53,460
'Prof. Chatterjee called
from Delhi regarding thesis.'

616
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:55,280
If you do thesis under him,
the credibility of your PhD is different.

617
00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:29,850
So, you want to go to Delhi,
finish your PhD and get a job.

618
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:31,630
Then we will get married.

619
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:34,810
I am doing this for our future.

620
00:47:35,090 --> 00:47:36,300
This is your future.

621
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:37,980
Where am I, Uma?

622
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:40,230
Just one year.

623
00:47:41,930 --> 00:47:43,350
Meanwhile if my parents
get me married here.

624
00:47:43,830 --> 00:47:45,900
If it comes to that
I will come and take you away.

625
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:47,580
But not right now.

626
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:54,150
Understand. Just one year.
165.

627
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:56,650
There's no second chance in love.
- Pallavi.

628
00:48:15,950 --> 00:48:16,600
What's up.

629
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:19,400
You said you'd stay till Chintu
complete his PhD.

630
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:20,770
How can you just leave?

631
00:48:22,790 --> 00:48:25,250
I don't want to go but I have no choice.

632
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:27,970
For a better future.

633
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:29,890
It's for our good.

634
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:31,490
Thank you, sir.

635
00:48:32,970 --> 00:48:33,370
I'll see you soon.

636
00:48:35,110 --> 00:48:36,280
Hang the 'To-Let' board again.

637
00:49:12,330 --> 00:49:22,460
"I asked the voice in my heart
Oh passing time! Where is my love?"

638
00:49:23,470 --> 00:49:33,150
"I forgot myself thinking of her
I asked my heart where her presence is"

639
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:38,850
"I canÃƒÂ¢t imagine myself without you"

640
00:49:39,290 --> 00:49:44,590
"I look for our story
in every thought of mine"

641
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:54,670
"I am within you, desiring for you
I walked along with you as the truth"

642
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:33,720
"You are in the depths of my heart"

643
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:39,030
"You are my better half and my world"

644
00:50:40,330 --> 00:50:45,120
"Your friendship is the tune that guides me"

645
00:50:45,970 --> 00:50:50,840
"This journey doesnÃƒÂ¢t halt
at just reaching you"

646
00:50:51,490 --> 00:50:55,280
"This travel has no exhaustion"

647
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:16,450
What, sister?
Why so suddenly?

648
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:17,560
Come, get ready fast.

649
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:22,150
She is our younger daughter, Pallavi!

650
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:24,710
Greetings!

651
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:36,270
Do you have any special hobbies
like music and cookery?

652
00:51:36,530 --> 00:51:38,650
She learnt almost all items
cooking from youtube.

653
00:51:51,310 --> 00:51:53,050
Ok, happy.
- Ok.

654
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:04,100
<<Phone ringing>>

655
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:06,870
Hi Pallavi.
- Uma.

656
00:52:07,310 --> 00:52:10,000
What an amazing timing.
I am going to submit my final paper.

657
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:12,110
I'll be Uma Maheshwar Rao PhD
in six months.

658
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:15,820
Pallavi, my life ambition
is going to be fulfiled.

659
00:52:16,450 --> 00:52:18,140
I had a weird feeling
that we didn't talk.

660
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:20,550
But now that you have called
I am very happy.

661
00:52:21,290 --> 00:52:22,920
What are you thinking about?
Wish me all the best.

662
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:30,390
All the best.
- Thank you. Thank you so much.

663
00:52:30,890 --> 00:52:32,410
I will call you back after the seminar.

664
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:34,230
There's a lot we need to talk. Bye. Bye.

665
00:52:55,550 --> 00:52:57,420
You must call Uma once again.

666
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,930
He might have come down
to take me away maybe.

667
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:13,500
But after that if he said
that I ruined his career,

668
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:17,510
I can't take it.

669
00:54:03,670 --> 00:54:06,180
From the past one year,
I've been talking to myself.

670
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:07,740
Not for another moment.
- Uma.

671
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:15,100
I didn't come to stay with you.

672
00:54:16,990 --> 00:54:20,690
Prof. Murthy called me yesterday.
- This is Prof. Murthy.

673
00:54:20,910 --> 00:54:23,030
How are you doing, sir?

674
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:25,500
I am good dear.
How are you?

675
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:29,190
I am good. How is Uma?

676
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:32,140
I am sure he's got a great position.

677
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:33,070
No dear.

678
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:37,520
He went under depression
when knew about your wedding.

679
00:54:38,010 --> 00:54:41,120
I sent him to the US to get a job.

680
00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:44,190
He couldn't think over you.

681
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:46,240
He's become an alcohol addict now.

682
00:54:49,790 --> 00:54:51,170
He told me that he was going to meet you.

683
00:54:52,050 --> 00:54:53,030
I said that it would be wrong.

684
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,680
Now he stopped going to the office.

685
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:03,140
If he doesn't take over the project
in 10 days they will fire him.

686
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:13,800
He's not in a state
to even listen to me.

687
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:17,750
I was hoping if you could
explain it to him.

688
00:55:19,970 --> 00:55:21,780
He's the best student in my career.

689
00:55:22,990 --> 00:55:23,970
I can't see him ruin everything.

690
00:55:43,190 --> 00:55:44,750
Are you here to show sympathy?

691
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:46,510
No Uma.

692
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:51,630
I thought you forgot everything
and leading a happy life.

693
00:55:51,690 --> 00:55:52,250
It's a lie.

694
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:56,190
If your love was true.
This is all a lie.

695
00:55:57,270 --> 00:55:58,260
Don't you think I know?

696
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:00,630
Many girls get married for their parents...

697
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:02,910
For their parents and society's contentment.

698
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:05,050
Spend life with a guy
that they don't love at all.

699
00:56:06,450 --> 00:56:08,490
But you don't need this.
I am there for you.

700
00:56:08,730 --> 00:56:10,570
Just say it, I'll take care of everything.

701
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:13,840
I am very happy with Arun.

702
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:17,000
How do I tell you.
65.

703
00:56:18,530 --> 00:56:23,310
The care and affection that he showered
on me has left our love clouded.

704
00:56:24,110 --> 00:56:25,480
Did you just say that?

705
00:56:26,930 --> 00:56:28,600
Look straight into my eyes and tell me.

706
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:31,290
Tell me that you don't love me.

707
00:56:32,150 --> 00:56:33,410
No, Uma.
- Why aren't you looking?

708
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:37,590
If you do, that cloud will melt away
in your tears, right? - Uma.

709
00:56:39,150 --> 00:56:41,400
You are not understanding.
- Why did you come?

710
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:45,480
What if I drink? What if I am jobless?

711
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:49,890
What if I die?
- I am here to stop all of that.

712
00:56:53,810 --> 00:56:59,590
That day, I felt your career was more
important than our life together.

713
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:02,450
That's why I got married and left.

714
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:08,080
And if you ruin that career now,
I can't take it.

715
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:14,750
I don't care about anything, Pallavi.

716
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:19,250
You can't expect me to happy
when you are suffering there.

717
00:57:20,590 --> 00:57:23,010
Whatever it may be,
you will come for me,

718
00:57:24,450 --> 00:57:25,150
I will wait for you.

719
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:26,290
Uma.

720
00:57:28,090 --> 00:57:28,540
Uma.

721
00:57:42,090 --> 00:57:44,570
Okay, time to get the party started.
Pop the champagne.

722
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:49,360
Out of all in the gang,
you guys are made for each other, Arun.

723
00:57:49,750 --> 00:57:51,690
Hello, it's us after them.

724
00:57:52,370 --> 00:57:54,110
Dude, these guys are mad for each other.
That's true, bro. 87.

725
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:55,420
Let's celebrate.

726
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:07,780
I love you.

727
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:32,860
Pallavi.

728
00:58:34,270 --> 00:58:35,000
Is everything okay?

729
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:40,480
Pallavi.
- I met Uma today.

730
00:58:43,710 --> 00:58:44,090
What?

731
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:47,150
When I told you about Uma
after the wedding,

732
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:51,770
The amount of support you gave for me
to become normal..

733
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:55,810
... Is beyond words.

734
00:58:59,890 --> 00:59:02,560
Love doesn't stop with the first..

735
00:59:05,130 --> 00:59:07,120
I knew this after you came into my life.

736
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:13,550
But Uma...
100.

737
00:59:16,810 --> 00:59:21,820
Is ruining his life thinking
that I am suffering with you.

738
00:59:27,290 --> 00:59:31,030
I think I am responsible for that.
It's killing me.

739
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:38,630
How do I tell him that
I am very happy with you.

740
00:59:40,730 --> 00:59:41,980
He'd know if he sees, right?

741
00:59:55,030 --> 00:59:56,810
What if he really sees us.

742
01:00:01,630 --> 01:00:03,560
Arun, let's call Uma home for 10 days.

743
01:00:04,670 --> 01:00:08,590
If he sees it for himself
he'll believe it.

744
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:10,430
Then he will move on with his life.

745
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:19,790
Only if you are okay.
109.

746
01:00:23,650 --> 01:00:23,940
Pallavi.

747
01:00:25,570 --> 01:00:29,290
If your guilt goes with him getting back
to normalcy, let him come.

748
01:00:31,620 --> 01:00:32,830
I want your happiness.

749
01:00:37,930 --> 01:00:38,640
Thank you, Arun.

750
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:45,400
Thank you.
- That's okay.

751
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:58,210
What? I should stay with you to see
how you and your husband and living happily?

752
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:00,050
Uma.

753
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:04,550
You are spoiling your life thinking
that I am suffering here, right?

754
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:07,290
Come and see for yourself.

755
01:01:07,950 --> 01:01:10,600
You will realize that I am living
a happy life with my husband.

756
01:01:11,110 --> 01:01:11,900
What if I realize?

757
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:15,320
I want you to forget everything
and rejoin work.

758
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:18,510
You should start a new life.

759
01:01:19,860 --> 01:01:21,080
What if I don't realize?

760
01:01:22,530 --> 01:01:25,420
And what if you realize
that you still love me?

761
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:29,350
Will you let go off everything
and come with me?

762
01:01:33,710 --> 01:01:36,390
See Pallavi, you know the truth.

763
01:01:36,940 --> 01:01:38,340
Your silence says it all.
- I will come, Uma.

764
01:01:40,930 --> 01:01:44,740
Only when your come
your heart will know the truth.

765
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:47,230
Pallavi.

766
01:01:48,430 --> 01:01:51,700
Remember, you said
there's no second chance in Love.

767
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:54,930
You are now calling me
and giving me a second chance.

768
01:01:58,240 --> 01:01:59,060
Do you understand..

769
01:02:00,540 --> 01:02:02,110
... My victory has already begun.

770
01:02:05,150 --> 01:02:07,010
You can't guess the winner
in the beginning of the game.

771
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:09,110
We'll know towards the end.

772
01:02:10,950 --> 01:02:11,510
Let's see.

773
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:15,030
See you.

774
01:03:04,690 --> 01:03:05,070
Hi, Uma.

775
01:03:10,580 --> 01:03:10,810
Arun.

776
01:03:11,820 --> 01:03:12,210
Uma.

777
01:03:13,710 --> 01:03:14,260
Hi Uma.

778
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:16,760
Arun.
- Where is the washroom?

779
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:38,250
Arun, give a break please.

780
01:03:43,020 --> 01:03:45,000
Good morning, Uma.
- Good morning.

781
01:03:46,940 --> 01:03:47,370
Coffee?

782
01:03:49,110 --> 01:03:51,530
Uma, you spent all these years
as a bachelor.

783
01:03:52,140 --> 01:03:54,970
Can't you make a coffee?
Come help yourself.

784
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:56,030
But you gave him coffee.

785
01:03:58,060 --> 01:03:59,590
Even he was a bachelor before marriage.

786
01:04:00,270 --> 01:04:02,570
Get married,
Your wife will serve you.

787
01:04:03,030 --> 01:04:06,890
Not just coffee
but tea and breakfast too.

788
01:04:07,690 --> 01:04:08,230
You won't come, right?

789
01:04:09,230 --> 01:04:11,390
I'll make my coffee.

790
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:20,790
You chopped them now?
When will you cook?

791
01:04:21,780 --> 01:04:24,450
It's a Venusian salad, Uma.
Arun eats it.

792
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:27,740
He is very health concious,
Actually I got habituated too.

793
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:29,640
It's better if you too get used to it.

794
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:31,150
Will you eat this for health, brother?

795
01:04:32,270 --> 01:04:33,370
At our place, they eat this
if they fall sick.

796
01:04:36,250 --> 01:04:38,340
Your would feed me cashew upma.

797
01:04:42,580 --> 01:04:43,260
That was in Vizag.

798
01:04:45,620 --> 01:04:48,710
She would cook it
in the pent house sometimes.

799
01:04:50,770 --> 01:04:52,470
Do you know how well
Pallavi makes upma?

800
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,360
Is it?
- Is it?

801
01:04:56,990 --> 01:05:00,480
As the flour in a supermarket is bad,
she especially buys it outside.

802
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:01,700
Uma, enough now.

803
01:05:02,180 --> 01:05:04,450
With some ghee, cashew,

804
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:09,050
Chopped chilli are sprinkled,

805
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:10,520
You would add something in the end.

806
01:05:11,370 --> 01:05:11,960
Coriander...
- Yes.

807
01:05:14,130 --> 01:05:14,880
Coriander.

808
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:18,920
Felt like I can live eating upma
all my life.

809
01:05:20,660 --> 01:05:22,400
Pallavi is crazy about Uma.

810
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:27,720
What happened?

811
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:31,420
Pallavi is crazy about upma. Isn't it?

812
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:33,750
Ya...

813
01:05:35,030 --> 01:05:37,550
Why don't you cook something you like?
Why cook for me?

814
01:05:39,190 --> 01:05:40,910
I can leave anything for you, Arun.

815
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:46,720
Okay, Pallavi. I will be back.
- Okay.

816
01:05:51,990 --> 01:05:53,060
You are good at wife's duty.

817
01:05:55,350 --> 01:05:58,590
Does it seem like a duty to you?
I am doing it with love.

818
01:05:59,270 --> 01:06:02,330
I mean, you are doing
your duty well with love.

819
01:06:07,870 --> 01:06:11,570
Pallavi, I am leaving to the office.
I'll call you in the evening.

820
01:06:12,450 --> 01:06:12,890
Oh.

821
01:06:13,310 --> 01:06:15,070
Actually, I have to leave too.
- Okay. Let's move.

822
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:16,030
What do I do then?

823
01:06:17,860 --> 01:06:19,870
Tour around the house.
Play with tiger.

824
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:24,900
That's a tiger and
I have to play with it.

825
01:06:26,660 --> 01:06:30,910
Am I a guest or security in this house?

826
01:06:33,820 --> 01:06:34,710
One of you take me with you.

827
01:06:39,590 --> 01:06:39,970
Okay.

828
01:06:45,870 --> 01:06:46,380
Seat belt.

829
01:06:54,330 --> 01:06:54,990
Where are we having lunch, bro.

830
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:56,860
We just had our breakfast.

831
01:06:57,710 --> 01:07:01,110
It's better if we preplan, right?
We struggled once already.

832
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:03,510
What?
- Nice... Nice car.

833
01:07:09,810 --> 01:07:13,510
Bringing him home was a huge mistake,
you sent him with Arun now.

834
01:07:13,670 --> 01:07:15,850
You are creating problems
for yourself, Pallavi.

835
01:07:16,230 --> 01:07:19,480
I felt it is right to solve this problem
rather than facing it our entire lives.

836
01:07:21,250 --> 01:07:22,990
I believe that
he is going to change.

837
01:07:23,230 --> 01:07:24,870
He would change?
I doubt it.

838
01:07:27,010 --> 01:07:29,260
If anyone asks,
Tell them you are my friend.

839
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:31,670
Obviously. Will I say
Pallavi's ex-boyfriend otherwise.

840
01:07:33,710 --> 01:07:35,010
I won't say it. It will sound bad.

841
01:07:35,050 --> 01:07:36,080
Good morning, sir.
- Morning.

842
01:07:37,170 --> 01:07:40,720
Morning sir.
- Good morning.

843
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:44,860
What is this brother?
Artificial greetings and plastic faces.

844
01:07:45,420 --> 01:07:49,030
Do you know the first time
Pallavi called me "Master" with lots of love?

845
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:54,010
Pallavi shows love even towards servants.

846
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:57,710
It's her nature. Stick on.

847
01:08:01,820 --> 01:08:03,200
Even you are delivered punches
sometimes, Uma.

848
01:08:04,350 --> 01:08:05,040
Hello, Mr. Prasad.

849
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:09,870
How do you know my name?
- If there isn't one Prasad in every four people,

850
01:08:09,980 --> 01:08:10,720
Why would this be America?

851
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:12,620
Yeah. That's right.
- What's for lunch?

852
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:23,790
Not just once or twice...
- She gets upma to the university.

853
01:08:24,810 --> 01:08:25,910
Such a good girlfriend, boss!

854
01:08:26,610 --> 01:08:28,340
Isn't it?
- Shouldn't have gone to Delhi.

855
01:08:28,630 --> 01:08:29,720
Correct.
- if she goes to Delhi?

856
01:08:29,990 --> 01:08:32,610
Will she get married without his notice.
This is very unfair.

857
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:36,150
Why didn't she call and say
about the marriage. Pity.

858
01:08:38,370 --> 01:08:39,670
Forget about that.

859
01:08:40,460 --> 01:08:42,880
After coming to USA...
- Uma..

860
01:08:43,490 --> 01:08:45,540
Sir, your friend is superb.

861
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:48,230
What a love story!
What a feeling!

862
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:50,710
Love story? Whose?

863
01:08:50,930 --> 01:08:52,680
His friend's love story, sir.
- Oh...

864
01:08:54,010 --> 01:08:55,920
Friend's.
- Uma, let's go.

865
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:56,930
Sir.

866
01:08:57,630 --> 01:09:00,980
Sir, story has just reached India from USA.
You came in between.

867
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:02,320
Let him complete, sir.

868
01:09:02,850 --> 01:09:05,020
Complete your work first.
Uma, let's start.

869
01:09:05,410 --> 01:09:06,900
Okay guys. I have to leave.

870
01:09:07,370 --> 01:09:09,530
Next time we will discuss in detail.
- Uma.

871
01:09:10,030 --> 01:09:12,420
Can we go?
- Bye. See you.

872
01:09:13,260 --> 01:09:18,150
No, we are going for dinner.
Pallavi is already waiting for us at the restaurant.

873
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:24,790
Thank you.
- Yeah. Finally...

874
01:09:28,890 --> 01:09:29,520
What happened?

875
01:09:34,340 --> 01:09:34,860
Oh...

876
01:09:36,630 --> 01:09:38,070
Could you just tell me what it is.

877
01:09:39,030 --> 01:09:39,790
You tell him.

878
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:41,620
You tell him.

879
01:09:41,710 --> 01:09:43,420
Damn! Somebody say what it is.

880
01:09:43,740 --> 01:09:46,640
Okay. I will say it.
- Wait for a minute. let me tell.

881
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:47,850
Okay, tell him.

882
01:09:48,650 --> 01:09:50,290
Pallavi wanted to eat prawns biryani.

883
01:09:51,180 --> 01:09:53,040
So I took her to Raju's dhaba in Rushikonda.

884
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:58,470
After reaching, madam challenged me. "I dare
you to leave without paying the bill".

885
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:01,090
So I thought we could escape somehow.
Meanwhile, the owners saw us.

886
01:10:01,180 --> 01:10:03,640
We ran and they chased us.
That's all, brother.

887
01:10:05,230 --> 01:10:08,750
No, Arun. He is not saying what actually
happened. I will tell you.

888
01:10:09,170 --> 01:10:09,700
Pallavi...

889
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:13,580
After escaping that day...
Whenever we went to Rushikonda,

890
01:10:13,590 --> 01:10:15,120
Uma would wear a monkey cap.

891
01:10:16,580 --> 01:10:18,640
He looks exactly like a Gurkha.

892
01:10:20,810 --> 01:10:21,230
Me?

893
01:10:21,390 --> 01:10:23,050
Why don't we pay 500 rupees bill?

894
01:10:23,310 --> 01:10:24,450
He is a super market
owner just for namesake.

895
01:10:24,870 --> 01:10:26,380
Very greedy family.

896
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:28,810
Her brother-in-law is a master piece.

897
01:10:29,020 --> 01:10:32,010
Who is it? Sir didn't even
have a rupee in his hand.

898
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:32,290
Really?

899
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:35,710
You know I would give items from
our super market for free.

900
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:37,480
I would also pay for his fuel.

901
01:10:37,750 --> 01:10:39,860
He would pay half for fuel and
buy beer with the rest.

902
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:42,220
I gave you so many...
- What did you give?

903
01:10:42,270 --> 01:10:43,050
What did you give?

904
01:10:43,300 --> 01:10:45,110
You gave a dairy milk in the beginning.

905
01:10:45,330 --> 01:10:48,160
But I gave a watch for new year eve,
T-shirt for pongal.

906
01:10:48,220 --> 01:10:49,950
A reading lamp for Diwali.
I gave a lot.

907
01:10:51,350 --> 01:10:54,530
Okay. If we continue talking,
food will get cold. Have it.

908
01:10:57,430 --> 01:11:00,110
Why aren't you eating, brother? Any problem?
- No. I'm good.

909
01:11:01,370 --> 01:11:04,290
You might also be having memories like so.

910
01:11:05,020 --> 01:11:06,530
I would like to listen.

911
01:11:07,810 --> 01:11:08,530
You have nothing?

912
01:11:09,730 --> 01:11:11,690
Let's eat?
- Okay.

913
01:11:16,350 --> 01:11:19,600
Pallavi, I need to refill the gas,
if you want things get them.

914
01:11:26,770 --> 01:11:29,340
You didn't forget anything, Pallavi.
- Forget what?

915
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:31,640
You know what I am talking about.

916
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:36,330
Hey... My bag... Hey...

917
01:11:57,620 --> 01:11:58,650
Arun...
- Pallavi, wait.

918
01:12:02,710 --> 01:12:03,870
Stay here.
- Uma.

919
01:12:09,770 --> 01:12:12,970
Arun, are you fine?
- I am okay.

920
01:12:13,070 --> 01:12:13,740
Are you crazy?

921
01:12:14,180 --> 01:12:16,390
He has a knife.
- They kill for small issues here.

922
01:12:16,460 --> 01:12:17,080
What if something happened to you?

923
01:12:17,290 --> 01:12:19,300
Just for a bag after all...
- Not after all.

924
01:12:22,570 --> 01:12:23,320
It's our memory.

925
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:26,330
My first gift to Pallavi.

926
01:12:31,260 --> 01:12:31,480
Ya.

927
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:36,190
Arun.

928
01:12:37,690 --> 01:12:38,680
I'm fine.

929
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:46,270
Good night, Uma.
- Good night? I can't sleep if you both sleep together.

930
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:49,540
What?
- I mean I can't sleep alone.

931
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:52,180
Why?
- What do I say?

932
01:12:52,510 --> 01:12:54,300
New place.
On top of that, I am scared of ghosts.

933
01:12:54,710 --> 01:12:57,220
Last time, it took me ten days to sleep
in your pent house. Remember?

934
01:12:58,750 --> 01:12:59,260
So...

935
01:13:01,370 --> 01:13:07,030
So, I will sleep in his room if needed -
Thank you, brother.

936
01:13:08,170 --> 01:13:09,190
I will sleep peacefully now.

937
01:13:11,020 --> 01:13:12,070
Okay, Good night.

938
01:13:12,580 --> 01:13:14,190
And... Pallavi.
- Ya.

939
01:13:14,290 --> 01:13:16,760
We are going for trekking tomorrow.
We need to wake up early.

940
01:13:16,990 --> 01:13:18,130
Okay. Good night.

941
01:13:22,060 --> 01:13:22,460
Uma.

942
01:13:27,580 --> 01:13:28,350
What, Pallavi?

943
01:13:30,370 --> 01:13:30,840
Good night.

944
01:13:39,730 --> 01:13:51,070
"Dad says you will be renowned one day."

945
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:14,080
Pallavi... are you ready?
- Yeah, ready.

946
01:14:14,630 --> 01:14:15,800
It's time. Where is Uma?

947
01:14:16,490 --> 01:14:19,740
I thought he is in your room.
- No, I thought he came downstairs.

948
01:14:20,090 --> 01:14:23,350
Ball... Ball... Ball...
Hit him... Hit him...

949
01:14:25,050 --> 01:14:26,110
Give me the ball.

950
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:27,800
He is dead today.

951
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:30,410
Finish him.

952
01:14:31,810 --> 01:14:33,160
That's it!
- Uma.

953
01:14:33,510 --> 01:14:33,950
Out.

954
01:14:37,220 --> 01:14:38,120
What is this Uma?

955
01:14:38,580 --> 01:14:39,180
Seven stones game.

956
01:14:39,270 --> 01:14:41,160
It looks like a sad game.
Such a violent game.

957
01:14:41,420 --> 01:14:42,190
What if something happens to kids?

958
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:43,790
Here, they don't accept if we scold the kid.

959
01:14:44,110 --> 01:14:45,550
If they play this, they will be behind bars.

960
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:47,400
What do get by watching cartoons at home?

961
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:50,770
If they come out and play.
One will know what's laughter and life.

962
01:14:51,350 --> 01:14:53,380
- Hey Arun...
- Hi Arun...

963
01:14:54,180 --> 01:14:55,170
Hey guys!
- Hi.

964
01:14:56,130 --> 01:14:59,540
Hey guys! How are you?
- All set for trekking, guys?

965
01:15:01,850 --> 01:15:03,720
How come you are here?
- That's my question.

966
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:06,260
Kavita settled here as a dentist.

967
01:15:07,660 --> 01:15:09,760
Oh.. seems she could do nothing in
India and so she pulls teeth here.

968
01:15:10,990 --> 01:15:11,460
Joke...

969
01:15:13,780 --> 01:15:16,760
Uma... Debashish is Kavita's husband.
- Is he the unlucky one?

970
01:15:17,060 --> 01:15:18,020
Hello, sir.
- Hello, man.

971
01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:19,360
Who is he? You didn't introduce him

972
01:15:21,150 --> 01:15:22,410
He is my classmate.

973
01:15:23,050 --> 01:15:23,700
Classmate?

974
01:15:24,070 --> 01:15:28,450
We studied together in Dehradun.
I haven't seen you there.

975
01:15:29,150 --> 01:15:30,040
In Dehradun...

976
01:15:31,060 --> 01:15:33,160
When did you both study together?
sixth grade to Tenth Grade.

977
01:15:33,390 --> 01:15:34,180
We studied from first to fifth grade.

978
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:36,590
Ya, correct.

979
01:15:37,670 --> 01:15:38,470
Just miss...

980
01:15:39,260 --> 01:15:40,790
It's okay. Let's go.
- Come. Let's go.

981
01:15:42,790 --> 01:15:45,720
Wow.
- Trekking is very healthy.

982
01:15:46,310 --> 01:15:49,190
There's 40% fresh oxygen in the city.

983
01:15:49,550 --> 01:15:52,500
We have 80% pure oxygen here.

984
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:56,080
Let's all join in ICU then.
We get 100% oxygen.

985
01:15:59,010 --> 01:16:00,590
Joke. Joke.

986
01:16:00,740 --> 01:16:01,570
Hey, come on.
- Whatever.

987
01:16:03,430 --> 01:16:07,590
You find yourself at such places.

988
01:16:09,270 --> 01:16:11,700
Every experience is an achievement, Uma.
- We are almost there.

989
01:16:12,270 --> 01:16:12,880
Let's move.

990
01:16:14,330 --> 01:16:15,280
My achievement is different.

991
01:16:18,690 --> 01:16:19,910
First time...
- What?

992
01:16:20,310 --> 01:16:21,970
Looking at a hill trying to climb another.

993
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:26,770
Look... If you try to take advantage of
Pallavi's innocence and disturb her life,

994
01:16:27,090 --> 01:16:27,860
I will not tolerate.

995
01:16:29,380 --> 01:16:31,680
Where is you husband? Debashish... Debashish...
- Why?

996
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:34,530
To discuss about your Vizag
flash back love stories.

997
01:16:36,570 --> 01:16:38,690
If you poke into my life,
I will disturb yours..

998
01:16:39,820 --> 01:16:41,370
Don't do that I beg you.

999
01:16:50,090 --> 01:16:53,110
Waters anyone?
Uma, water?

1000
01:16:53,530 --> 01:16:54,520
Yeah. Sure...

1001
01:16:55,910 --> 01:16:59,390
Pallavi... smile - Yeah.

1002
01:16:59,420 --> 01:17:02,290
You look beautiful.
- Hi guys! Attention please.

1003
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:06,320
We are going to make an announcement.

1004
01:17:07,650 --> 01:17:08,790
They didn't say anything yet.

1005
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:11,580
Are you buying a house?

1006
01:17:12,240 --> 01:17:12,690
No.

1007
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:14,720
Manasa, are you pregnant?

1008
01:17:15,070 --> 01:17:16,680
No, Pallavi.
- What is it then?

1009
01:17:17,580 --> 01:17:18,210
Then what?

1010
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,980
Actually, we are getting separated.

1011
01:17:21,310 --> 01:17:22,830
What?
- Are you getting separated?

1012
01:17:23,150 --> 01:17:24,390
What are you saying?
- What?

1013
01:17:25,910 --> 01:17:28,860
Suresh, we thought you guys
are mad for each other.

1014
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:31,760
That is what we thought and got married.

1015
01:17:32,270 --> 01:17:37,170
But we realized after one year.
Our thoughts and likes are all different.

1016
01:17:37,220 --> 01:17:40,970
We are mechanically together
but there is no love.

1017
01:17:41,110 --> 01:17:43,150
That is why the both of us...
- What, Manasa?

1018
01:17:44,190 --> 01:17:46,130
You understood there's no
love just in an year?

1019
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:48,690
You might feel it once you have kids.

1020
01:17:48,860 --> 01:17:51,820
Be positive, Suresh. I think you guys
have to take some more time.

1021
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:53,960
Will you ideal couple please
stop for a while?

1022
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:55,490
Damn this guy.

1023
01:17:58,120 --> 01:17:58,950
Take time?

1024
01:18:00,110 --> 01:18:01,090
Wait until they have kids?

1025
01:18:01,950 --> 01:18:04,540
Are you saying they should separate after their
understanding turns into misunderstanding,

1026
01:18:04,660 --> 01:18:09,460
Get into fights after having kids,
argue who should have the kids.

1027
01:18:09,550 --> 01:18:13,040
Hate each other at the court, spoil their
kids' lives along with theirs?

1028
01:18:13,140 --> 01:18:14,270
That will be good time to separate?

1029
01:18:17,050 --> 01:18:19,470
Isn't it better to happily separate right now
when they still have some understanding?

1030
01:18:21,740 --> 01:18:25,450
They want to give their life a second chance.
Let them find their soul mates.

1031
01:18:27,100 --> 01:18:27,820
Manasa... Listen...

1032
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:30,830
You guys should give down more time -
One minute.

1033
01:18:32,070 --> 01:18:35,440
I am telling you, boss.
No relationship stands without love.

1034
01:18:36,350 --> 01:18:37,720
Even if they are husband and wife.

1035
01:18:40,310 --> 01:18:40,970
Thank for that.

1036
01:18:42,010 --> 01:18:45,860
So we wish to celebrate Manasa's
birthday before separating.

1037
01:18:46,180 --> 01:18:48,250
All of you should be there.
- I will come.

1038
01:18:49,150 --> 01:18:50,690
Definitely.
- your wish man.

1039
01:19:02,630 --> 01:19:03,450
Look, Pallavi.

1040
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:05,520
They got some clarity.

1041
01:19:08,490 --> 01:19:09,280
You should only get it.

1042
01:19:12,910 --> 01:19:14,560
I don't need any clarity, Uma.

1043
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:16,880
It's you.

1044
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:31,030
Pallavi

1045
01:19:33,750 --> 01:19:34,330
What is this?

1046
01:19:35,570 --> 01:19:37,550
Half boiled...
- I'm half boiled too.

1047
01:19:42,670 --> 01:19:43,340
Joke, brother.

1048
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:48,260
So, you don't drink.

1049
01:19:49,470 --> 01:19:49,930
No.

1050
01:19:51,250 --> 01:19:52,940
These girls can't be
understood at all, boss.

1051
01:19:53,470 --> 01:19:55,490
They love a guy with all the habits.

1052
01:19:58,330 --> 01:20:00,440
They marry a guy with no habits.

1053
01:20:04,060 --> 01:20:05,080
I am drunk, brother.

1054
01:20:07,170 --> 01:20:08,330
Don't feel bad.

1055
01:20:10,890 --> 01:20:11,710
Yes, brother.

1056
01:20:14,380 --> 01:20:17,790
How many girls did you before
getting married to Pallavi?

1057
01:20:18,140 --> 01:20:18,810
Why do you need that now?

1058
01:20:20,850 --> 01:20:23,310
Maybe three or four...

1059
01:20:25,030 --> 01:20:28,160
So, Pallavi is number five.

1060
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:33,630
If you would like any other girl,

1061
01:20:34,620 --> 01:20:36,160
Pallavi wouldn't be in your life.

1062
01:20:43,410 --> 01:20:47,160
Pallavi is just your
option but not a choice.

1063
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:50,510
But I am not like that.

1064
01:20:56,060 --> 01:21:00,040
I love her and I wanted to marry her only.

1065
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:04,780
I thought my life and death was with her.

1066
01:21:07,030 --> 01:21:07,930
Isn't mine true love?

1067
01:21:09,410 --> 01:21:10,840
Uma, you are crossing your limits.

1068
01:21:12,070 --> 01:21:14,060
Pallavi, let him talk.

1069
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:20,720
During the match.

1070
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:25,220
What all did you ask Pallavi?

1071
01:21:26,620 --> 01:21:28,230
That day, I was...

1072
01:21:29,710 --> 01:21:30,890
He is very broad-minded.

1073
01:21:31,410 --> 01:21:35,600
When he asked if I wanted to work
or stay home after marriage.

1074
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:38,820
He let me choose and gave
me a lot of freedom.

1075
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:41,160
Haven't you asked if she loved
someone else before?

1076
01:21:45,510 --> 01:21:48,070
Haven't you asked if she loved
someone else before?.

1077
01:21:49,770 --> 01:21:51,460
That innocent one might have told you.

1078
01:21:53,610 --> 01:21:54,950
Our love would have lived.

1079
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:02,600
What can you do...

1080
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:06,930
You would look for another match.
That's all, right?

1081
01:22:07,770 --> 01:22:08,730
Stop it, Uma.

1082
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:10,670
Don't be childish.

1083
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:13,140
Okay, I am childish.

1084
01:22:15,220 --> 01:22:16,090
You are mature.

1085
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:20,920
I have a question for you.
- Ask me.

1086
01:22:22,390 --> 01:22:23,160
A girl..

1087
01:22:24,920 --> 01:22:26,790
If a girl thinks she is
unhappy with her husband.

1088
01:22:27,650 --> 01:22:28,630
Runs away with another guy,

1089
01:22:30,260 --> 01:22:30,970
What is it called?

1090
01:22:36,180 --> 01:22:40,290
They say "You are having a illegal
relationship with him"

1091
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:42,660
In the same way...

1092
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:45,970
When a girl loves a guy.

1093
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:49,900
But another guy marries her,

1094
01:22:51,950 --> 01:22:52,980
What is that called, brother?

1095
01:22:56,270 --> 01:23:02,780
I say "You are having an illegal
relationship with my love."

1096
01:23:07,590 --> 01:23:07,980
Pallavi.

1097
01:23:12,110 --> 01:23:12,570
Pallavi.

1098
01:23:32,770 --> 01:23:34,180
Happy birthday,
Manasa - Hi, Suresh.

1099
01:23:43,110 --> 01:23:47,970
Congratulations, boss. I wish your break up
call becomes the wake up call to many.

1100
01:23:48,140 --> 01:23:49,680
Congrats.
- Thank you so much, brother.

1101
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:54,100
You brought sparkle to the party.
- Many more to come.

1102
01:23:54,420 --> 01:23:55,690
Hey, Uma bro.
- Yes.

1103
01:23:59,100 --> 01:23:59,450
So.

1104
01:23:59,780 --> 01:24:01,090
Enjoying, bro?
- Yes.

1105
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:05,210
Bro, you left in between your friend's
love story. Why don't you complete it?

1106
01:24:05,340 --> 01:24:07,200
I am not able to feel
it as it's my friend's.

1107
01:24:07,320 --> 01:24:10,370
I will own it as mine and narrate - Okay,
boss. We will own it too.

1108
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:51,250
"Once upon a time, on the Vizag beach roadÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¦
She wished me saying - Hey Master! ÃƒÂ¢

1109
01:24:51,930 --> 01:24:58,240
"Once upon a time, on the Vizag beach roadÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¦
She wished me saying - Hey Master! ÃƒÂ¢

1110
01:24:58,650 --> 01:25:05,420
"She swayed her waist around She whispered
'I love you' in my ears"

1111
01:25:05,900 --> 01:25:12,530
"She closed both my eyes And that
is why it hurts like such"

1112
01:25:13,260 --> 01:25:19,770
"Break upÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¦ Break upÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¦ Break upÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¦ UmaÃƒÂ¢s
King like life is now packed up"

1113
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:27,090
"Break upÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¦ Break upÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¦ Break upÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¦ Uma's
King like life is now packed up"

1114
01:25:42,460 --> 01:25:46,130
"She sat behind me on the bike,
with hands on my shoulders"

1115
01:25:46,150 --> 01:25:49,690
"She promised not to let me go"

1116
01:25:49,700 --> 01:25:56,660
"While I thought I found my soul mate
She left me alone in the market"

1117
01:25:56,690 --> 01:26:00,060
"She followed me like a shooting star and
seemed like a sweet honey drop to me"

1118
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:03,600
"She has shown me stars in
the name of beauty"

1119
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:05,560
"She has shown me stars in
the name of beauty"

1120
01:26:06,030 --> 01:26:12,350
"Break upÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¦ Break upÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¦ Break upÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¦ UmaÃƒÂ¢s
King like life is now packed up"

1121
01:26:13,390 --> 01:26:19,900
"Break upÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¦ Break upÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¦ Break upÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¦ UmaÃƒÂ¢s
King like life is now packed up"

1122
01:26:49,820 --> 01:26:53,400
"She said all she wished for was happiness"

1123
01:26:53,510 --> 01:26:57,010
"She said that is why she
went far from my sight"

1124
01:26:57,110 --> 01:27:00,390
"How would the heart
stay happy without her?"

1125
01:27:00,660 --> 01:27:04,100
"When would she understand my pain?"

1126
01:27:04,220 --> 01:27:07,440
"Ladies are like this, bro.
Believing everything they sayÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¦"

1127
01:27:07,710 --> 01:27:12,800
"We give them our heart and they leave
with it They move on to somebody else"

1128
01:27:13,410 --> 01:27:19,600
"Break upÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¦ Break upÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¦ Break upÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¦ UmaÃƒÂ¢s
King like life is now packed up"

1129
01:27:20,780 --> 01:27:27,010
"Break upÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¦ Break upÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¦ Break upÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¦ UmaÃƒÂ¢s
King like life is now packed up"

1130
01:27:27,950 --> 01:27:35,060
"Break upÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¦ Break upÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¦ Break upÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¦ UmaÃƒÂ¢s
King like life is now packed up".

1131
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:43,540
<<Calling bell>>

1132
01:27:43,730 --> 01:27:44,470
Ya coming.

1133
01:27:51,420 --> 01:27:53,040
I told you, uncle.
She would be a surprise.

1134
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:54,910
We would have missed this
expression otherwise.

1135
01:27:56,250 --> 01:27:58,060
Dad.. all of sudden you are here?

1136
01:27:58,160 --> 01:28:01,120
Nothing. I wanted to see you and son-in-law.
We came.

1137
01:28:02,580 --> 01:28:05,330
He is Ramesh.
Lovababu's friend.

1138
01:28:06,120 --> 01:28:08,730
Greetings...
- He picked us up from the airport.

1139
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:10,010
You can go now.

1140
01:28:10,340 --> 01:28:11,440
Where is my bro?

1141
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:14,220
Brother... Brother...

1142
01:28:14,870 --> 01:28:15,610
Coffee.

1143
01:28:29,060 --> 01:28:30,300
Hey penthouse... What are you doing here?

1144
01:28:31,820 --> 01:28:33,080
What is he doing here?

1145
01:28:36,180 --> 01:28:39,380
Pallavi...
- He is my childhood classmate, uncle.

1146
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:43,420
Classmate? When? Where?

1147
01:28:45,290 --> 01:28:46,590
We studied together in Vizag.

1148
01:28:47,380 --> 01:28:48,840
He got a job in US.

1149
01:28:49,930 --> 01:28:52,130
I called him here to spend some
time together for 10 days.

1150
01:28:54,910 --> 01:28:56,680
Pallavi told me earlier that you know him really well.
- Yes.

1151
01:28:56,940 --> 01:28:58,870
Yes, dad. He came here two days ago.

1152
01:28:59,450 --> 01:29:00,520
Yea, sir. It's been two days.

1153
01:29:01,620 --> 01:29:02,150
Coming.

1154
01:29:06,040 --> 01:29:06,550
Two days ago.

1155
01:29:08,180 --> 01:29:10,660
Hey calculation...
Seems you settled well here.

1156
01:29:11,730 --> 01:29:13,740
Where is our pent house and where's America?

1157
01:29:14,680 --> 01:29:15,520
Here we meet again.

1158
01:29:16,490 --> 01:29:18,700
World is so small, isn't it?
Too small.

1159
01:29:19,640 --> 01:29:21,480
This must be a relation from another life,
father-in-law.

1160
01:29:23,250 --> 01:29:25,780
Dad, you must be tired.
Come and freshen up.

1161
01:29:26,070 --> 01:29:26,840
Make some coffee...

1162
01:29:27,680 --> 01:29:29,880
Ask calculation to do it otherwise.

1163
01:29:30,130 --> 01:29:31,700
Bro looks too slim.
- Fresh up.

1164
01:29:39,730 --> 01:29:43,410
Uma, you need to leave from here urgently It
will be a problem if my dad gets to know.

1165
01:29:44,140 --> 01:29:44,990
He will doubt us if I leave.

1166
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:47,460
Brother already committed I
will be here for 10 days.

1167
01:29:48,140 --> 01:29:50,350
It's okay, Pallavi.
They know him anyways.

1168
01:29:50,720 --> 01:29:51,350
Let him stay.

1169
01:29:54,520 --> 01:29:56,340
I will start to office. See you.

1170
01:29:56,910 --> 01:29:57,220
Okay.

1171
01:30:01,900 --> 01:30:04,430
Look, Uma.
If my dad knows why you came here,

1172
01:30:05,020 --> 01:30:06,010
I will never see your face again.

1173
01:30:07,420 --> 01:30:08,230
Why will I tell him?

1174
01:30:08,770 --> 01:30:09,280
Promise...?

1175
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:13,080
The other hand.

1176
01:30:17,720 --> 01:30:18,280
Promise.

1177
01:30:26,900 --> 01:30:28,630
I can't make out difference
between worker and the owner.

1178
01:30:29,030 --> 01:30:32,550
Such a big mall.
It will take a day to roam.

1179
01:30:32,620 --> 01:30:34,230
Salary wouldn't be enough to buy here.
- What?

1180
01:30:34,650 --> 01:30:36,440
I am saying both husband and
wife would have to work.

1181
01:30:36,540 --> 01:30:37,430
Watch your step, dad.

1182
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:39,570
Hey...
- Hi...

1183
01:30:41,900 --> 01:30:44,090
Dad, she is Swetha. Office colleague...

1184
01:30:44,340 --> 01:30:45,900
Greetings, uncle.
- Greetings, dear.

1185
01:30:46,850 --> 01:30:50,030
Look, Lovababu... Though they left out
country, culture stays the same.

1186
01:30:50,220 --> 01:30:51,640
Our way of bringing up is like that,
father-in-law.

1187
01:30:56,550 --> 01:30:57,180
Hey, Sekhar...

1188
01:30:57,850 --> 01:30:59,660
Hi, Pallavi. How are you?
- Hi, Sekhar...

1189
01:30:59,750 --> 01:31:02,240
Hi, Sweety. How are you?
how is school.

1190
01:31:04,100 --> 01:31:05,320
I got chocolate for you.

1191
01:31:08,130 --> 01:31:09,330
Dear, please don't mind.

1192
01:31:10,260 --> 01:31:12,000
Why is he calling him dad?

1193
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:14,140
Uncle, he is my ex-husband Sekhar.

1194
01:31:14,670 --> 01:31:16,820
That kid was born to us both.

1195
01:31:17,210 --> 01:31:19,030
That girl calls him dad?

1196
01:31:19,550 --> 01:31:22,860
Actually, she is my ex-wife.
She was born to us both.

1197
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,740
What about this girl?
- She is Peter's daughter.

1198
01:31:25,950 --> 01:31:27,470
That girl...
- She is my daughter.

1199
01:31:27,740 --> 01:31:30,510
It's like a Malayalam film.
I don't understand anything.

1200
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:32,000
Okay. This boy and that girl...

1201
01:31:34,470 --> 01:31:36,460
I didn't understand.
- I understood.

1202
01:31:36,780 --> 01:31:37,140
What?

1203
01:31:37,890 --> 01:31:38,470
I'll tell you.

1204
01:31:39,550 --> 01:31:41,320
You are now watching...
"Hum Aapke Hai Koun"

1205
01:31:42,250 --> 01:31:43,380
Swetha, come with your first husband.

1206
01:31:44,680 --> 01:31:45,910
Peter, come with your first wife.

1207
01:31:47,340 --> 01:31:51,240
As a result of their marriage,
they started Production No.1.

1208
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:52,290
A boy and a girl here.

1209
01:31:55,610 --> 01:31:58,860
Small issues raised later.
- Already?

1210
01:31:59,620 --> 01:32:02,490
Will they halt Production because of that?
Another boy and girl here.

1211
01:32:05,770 --> 01:32:07,690
Yelling developed into hitting.

1212
01:32:08,540 --> 01:32:09,310
At that time...

1213
01:32:10,460 --> 01:32:13,310
Peter connected to Swetha at that time.
Will Sekhar stay quiet?

1214
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:14,780
He connected to Jo.

1215
01:32:16,790 --> 01:32:19,310
They felt it's better to separate and
stay happy rather than fighting.

1216
01:32:20,540 --> 01:32:22,270
Pallavi, am I correct?

1217
01:32:22,620 --> 01:32:23,630
Yes.

1218
01:32:25,590 --> 01:32:26,840
They decided to go for the second marriage.

1219
01:32:28,180 --> 01:32:32,160
While leaving, Peter took his daughter
and Sekhar took his son. Shift!

1220
01:32:34,640 --> 01:32:38,970
The family photo you saw in the
beginning it's the same.

1221
01:32:39,970 --> 01:32:40,750
Almost the same.

1222
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:42,960
Pallavi.

1223
01:32:47,220 --> 01:32:50,040
They started a happy family again. This
little one was born. Production No. 3.

1224
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:53,640
They might start any moment.

1225
01:32:55,090 --> 01:32:57,200
You are now watching "Hum Saath Saath Hai."

1226
01:32:58,300 --> 01:33:01,460
Clarity, my foot! I feel dizzy.

1227
01:33:02,210 --> 01:33:07,050
Father-in-law, if we send them to Jeans
program, even anchor Suma will feel dizzy.

1228
01:33:11,370 --> 01:33:13,160
Sir... Sir... Drink slowly.

1229
01:33:13,590 --> 01:33:15,310
Why are you so tensed about other families?

1230
01:33:16,010 --> 01:33:17,680
He is tensed about his family.

1231
01:33:19,980 --> 01:33:20,520
That means...

1232
01:33:22,140 --> 01:33:25,640
You and aunty are getting divorced?
- No, we are not getting divorced.

1233
01:33:28,310 --> 01:33:31,210
Uma, you are Arun's best friend
and our family friend.

1234
01:33:31,450 --> 01:33:34,340
So, I am telling you.
- Wait, father-in-law. Wait...

1235
01:33:35,230 --> 01:33:37,750
Who's your favourite god?
- How does it matter?

1236
01:33:37,790 --> 01:33:38,480
Wait, father-in-law.

1237
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:40,100
Lord Balaji.

1238
01:33:40,760 --> 01:33:43,260
Promise you will not tell anyone
about what happens now.

1239
01:33:45,100 --> 01:33:46,730
Why is this family obsessive with promise.

1240
01:33:47,130 --> 01:33:47,540
What?

1241
01:33:49,150 --> 01:33:50,410
I promise I won't tell anyone

1242
01:33:51,160 --> 01:33:51,980
Tell him now, father-in-law.

1243
01:33:53,620 --> 01:33:55,590
You know Damodar, right?

1244
01:33:58,160 --> 01:34:00,320
Yes, in Vizag.

1245
01:34:00,890 --> 01:34:03,020
You warned a guy about his love
with Damodar's daughter.

1246
01:34:04,970 --> 01:34:09,340
Damodar later got his daughter married
to a guy of high stature.

1247
01:34:10,110 --> 01:34:14,770
But that girl committed suicide,
unable to forget her love.

1248
01:34:17,910 --> 01:34:21,500
That is when I felt I should've
got her married to her lover.

1249
01:34:22,580 --> 01:34:26,220
It's correct he can't provide her all the
facilities but she would atleast be alive.

1250
01:34:30,680 --> 01:34:32,730
Let it go, sir. What can we do?

1251
01:34:34,420 --> 01:34:35,220
She is unlucky.

1252
01:34:36,160 --> 01:34:38,510
No. He is really tensed about his daughter

1253
01:34:40,220 --> 01:34:40,990
About Pallavi?

1254
01:34:42,310 --> 01:34:45,280
Yes. Even Pallavi was in love.

1255
01:34:49,610 --> 01:34:52,270
You know?
- Do you know too?

1256
01:34:58,170 --> 01:34:59,580
How do you know?

1257
01:35:02,570 --> 01:35:04,590
I have to do everything.
- Your dad...

1258
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:06,160
Aren't you done yet?

1259
01:35:08,430 --> 01:35:09,110
Ready, uncle.

1260
01:35:10,600 --> 01:35:11,290
Calm down.

1261
01:35:26,270 --> 01:35:28,580
Your friend is happy, right?

1262
01:35:30,630 --> 01:35:33,250
I am asking you.
Is she in love by any chance?

1263
01:35:34,280 --> 01:35:34,930
Tell me!

1264
01:35:35,420 --> 01:35:36,470
Yes, uncle. She did love.

1265
01:35:36,720 --> 01:35:38,440
Who is he?
What will you do by knowing, uncle?

1266
01:35:38,710 --> 01:35:39,940
Will you get her married to him?

1267
01:35:40,100 --> 01:35:42,080
Never.
- Why do you ask then, uncle?

1268
01:35:42,450 --> 01:35:44,240
Shut up and check what's to be done.
Go.

1269
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:48,770
Just like every other parent,

1270
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:52,970
I got her married even after
knowing about her love.

1271
01:35:53,800 --> 01:36:01,400
But, I doubt if Pallavi too is unhappy with
her married life like Damodar's daughter?

1272
01:36:02,050 --> 01:36:03,310
That is why I came immediately.

1273
01:36:04,540 --> 01:36:07,260
That incident in the mall scared me more.

1274
01:36:08,450 --> 01:36:13,030
Are Arun and Pallavi happy together?

1275
01:36:19,810 --> 01:36:21,690
Why are you so silent?

1276
01:36:24,240 --> 01:36:25,860
I don't know how to tell you, sir

1277
01:36:26,320 --> 01:36:28,980
We will understand.
We can't tolerate this tension. Tell me.

1278
01:36:29,140 --> 01:36:32,490
I came here as my best friend called me.
There are four bedrooms in the house.

1279
01:36:33,400 --> 01:36:36,010
But he sleeps in my room.
When I ask why,

1280
01:36:37,060 --> 01:36:38,310
he says he is comfortable with me

1281
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:39,170
What?
- what?

1282
01:36:39,470 --> 01:36:40,580
If he is comfortable with me,
then he is not comfortable with her.

1283
01:36:40,950 --> 01:36:42,530
Not being with Pallavi,

1284
01:36:42,850 --> 01:36:44,800
Are you saying the truth?
- Check for yourself, sir.

1285
01:36:53,210 --> 01:36:54,680
We are sleeping, dear.
- Okay.

1286
01:36:55,660 --> 01:36:57,390
Got to sleep, dear.
- Okay, dad.

1287
01:37:06,420 --> 01:37:06,990
Is Arun here?

1288
01:37:08,610 --> 01:37:09,200
Is he there?
Can I come?

1289
01:37:15,300 --> 01:37:17,650
Uma, I am going to sleep. You are coming, right?
- Yeah Arun.

1290
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:35,260
Father-in-law,

1291
01:37:36,620 --> 01:37:37,580
He is right.

1292
01:37:38,550 --> 01:37:40,930
It's the film "Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam" -
What do you mean?

1293
01:37:41,250 --> 01:37:43,540
In that movie, Aishwarya Rai is
in love with Salman Khan.

1294
01:37:43,980 --> 01:37:45,900
But is in an unhappy marriage
with Ajay Devgan.

1295
01:37:46,340 --> 01:37:47,620
Pallavi's situation is the same.

1296
01:37:49,380 --> 01:37:50,610
Who is Ajay Devgan here?
- Arun.

1297
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:53,550
Salman Khan...
- We need to find out.

1298
01:38:02,250 --> 01:38:04,600
Dad, what happened?
- Toothache.

1299
01:38:06,310 --> 01:38:09,610
Kavita clinic is right here. Let's go.
- It's okay dear I can go.

1300
01:38:09,800 --> 01:38:14,950
It's okay, dad. I am working from home today
- Why disturb you work? I will go.

1301
01:38:14,970 --> 01:38:17,680
Pent house is here. He will take us.

1302
01:38:18,950 --> 01:38:19,860
Hey, pent house...

1303
01:38:27,930 --> 01:38:29,360
Sir, why do you have toothache
all of a sudden?

1304
01:38:29,650 --> 01:38:31,920
Toothache? He is acting.

1305
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:34,400
Acting?
- Yes.

1306
01:38:35,140 --> 01:38:39,040
Why are we going to meet Kavita?
- To know about Pallavi's lover.

1307
01:38:43,060 --> 01:38:46,350
What will you do by knowing?
- What will we do?

1308
01:38:46,780 --> 01:38:48,480
Father-in-law might get
Pallavi married to him.

1309
01:38:49,570 --> 01:38:51,700
How can we spoil her
life with our own hands?

1310
01:38:52,110 --> 01:38:53,640
Why do you bother?
- Yeah. Why do I bother?

1311
01:38:53,900 --> 01:38:55,400
You wait. Marriage?

1312
01:38:55,600 --> 01:38:57,700
We need to know who he is,
where he is, what he does.

1313
01:38:58,010 --> 01:39:00,180
If he still loves Pallavi.

1314
01:39:03,800 --> 01:39:04,860
How can he forget her so easily, sir?

1315
01:39:06,860 --> 01:39:07,700
He might be a true lover.

1316
01:39:08,920 --> 01:39:10,070
Ask Kavita properly, sir.

1317
01:39:11,690 --> 01:39:12,890
Properly...
Properly...

1318
01:39:14,230 --> 01:39:15,200
Properly...
Properly...

1319
01:39:16,360 --> 01:39:17,860
Properly...
Properly...

1320
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:20,460
Properly.
- Hey... Shut up.

1321
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:33,640
I never thought this fatso would
be useful for my love story.

1322
01:39:34,760 --> 01:39:36,060
Finally she is useful like this.

1323
01:39:37,060 --> 01:39:38,030
We can't say the truth.

1324
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:40,410
She will tell.

1325
01:39:44,680 --> 01:39:45,410
Hey Kavita.

1326
01:39:46,750 --> 01:39:48,690
Come on, uncle. Pallavi just called.

1327
01:39:49,030 --> 01:39:51,580
Sorry don't mind.
- I need to speak with you.

1328
01:39:52,150 --> 01:39:53,080
About what, uncle?

1329
01:40:00,270 --> 01:40:01,340
If this is taking a long time...

1330
01:40:03,310 --> 01:40:04,630
She is telling everything I guess.

1331
01:40:15,670 --> 01:40:17,030
Yes, sir.
- What?

1332
01:40:18,910 --> 01:40:19,430
Start the vehicle.

1333
01:40:26,980 --> 01:40:27,780
What did Kavita tell you, sir?

1334
01:40:36,920 --> 01:40:38,070
Mr. Lovababu.
- Yes.

1335
01:40:39,300 --> 01:40:41,000
What did Kavita say?
- Twins...

1336
01:40:41,370 --> 01:40:42,630
To whom?
- Sanyasi Naidu...

1337
01:40:42,680 --> 01:40:44,180
Who is he?
- The one who loved Pallavi.

1338
01:40:44,510 --> 01:40:45,950
He got married and settled in Jamaica.

1339
01:40:46,390 --> 01:40:47,040
Jamaica?

1340
01:40:48,160 --> 01:40:49,920
Kavita is an idiot.

1341
01:40:50,070 --> 01:40:55,510
He must be a scoundrel to get married before
his lover as her wedding was fixed.

1342
01:40:55,550 --> 01:40:56,350
Third class fellow.

1343
01:40:57,390 --> 01:41:00,850
I feel bad as my daughter still
thinks about such a guy. Damn!

1344
01:41:01,720 --> 01:41:04,240
I feel this information isn't correct, sir.

1345
01:41:04,480 --> 01:41:06,730
Do you know the right information?
- I can't tell you even if I know.

1346
01:41:07,330 --> 01:41:09,330
What?
- I will get to know and tell you.

1347
01:41:09,620 --> 01:41:10,050
Tell me.

1348
01:41:10,750 --> 01:41:15,560
I will tell you.
- Tell me.

1349
01:41:15,930 --> 01:41:16,670
Hey... Shut up.

1350
01:41:18,190 --> 01:41:21,100
Yes. Your dad doubts that you
and Arun aren't happy.

1351
01:41:21,340 --> 01:41:25,150
He asked me who you were in love with.
I said Sanyasi Naidu. I managed somehow.

1352
01:41:26,480 --> 01:41:27,770
I doubt Uma on this.

1353
01:41:30,350 --> 01:41:33,450
Kavita, I will talk to you later. Dad's here.
- Ok... bye.

1354
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:40,660
What, dad? Is your ache gone?
- Ache?

1355
01:41:42,150 --> 01:41:45,610
It's still there, dear.
- Stop it, dad.

1356
01:41:46,520 --> 01:41:47,890
Kavita told me everything.

1357
01:41:49,930 --> 01:41:52,070
Dad, Arun and I are really happy.

1358
01:41:52,870 --> 01:41:56,030
There is no one between us

1359
01:41:57,130 --> 01:41:58,580
Why are you tensed.

1360
01:41:59,790 --> 01:42:02,670
You have given me the best as a dad.

1361
01:42:03,360 --> 01:42:04,510
And Arun is the best.

1362
01:42:08,280 --> 01:42:08,870
Father-in-law.

1363
01:42:10,410 --> 01:42:11,290
The bedroom matter?

1364
01:42:14,100 --> 01:42:16,170
Yeah. you sleep in a room.

1365
01:42:16,590 --> 01:42:17,810
And son-in-law in another room.

1366
01:42:18,310 --> 01:42:21,080
Dad, he is Arun's best friend.

1367
01:42:21,470 --> 01:42:21,810
Yeah but...

1368
01:42:22,210 --> 01:42:25,070
They are chatting away and
then going to sleep.

1369
01:42:25,260 --> 01:42:26,790
What's wrong in that? Tell me.

1370
01:42:28,450 --> 01:42:29,050
What's wrong?

1371
01:42:30,580 --> 01:42:31,290
Friends, right?

1372
01:42:34,200 --> 01:42:37,770
You look happy, That's enough for me.

1373
01:42:41,660 --> 01:42:42,330
Okay.

1374
01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:46,770
Uma...

1375
01:42:48,640 --> 01:42:50,770
I had a little hope you will change.

1376
01:42:52,170 --> 01:42:53,020
That's no more now.

1377
01:42:54,070 --> 01:42:56,560
But I didn't say anything, Pallavi.

1378
01:43:00,190 --> 01:43:02,920
This house, Arun and my parents...

1379
01:43:04,220 --> 01:43:05,030
This is my world.

1380
01:43:06,500 --> 01:43:08,750
Though you agree or not.
This is the truth.

1381
01:43:10,810 --> 01:43:11,820
Now it's really over.

1382
01:43:20,620 --> 01:43:22,020
Food looks very delicious.

1383
01:43:22,650 --> 01:43:24,210
What is it, uncle.
You seem very happy today.

1384
01:43:24,410 --> 01:43:27,800
If some matters are cleared.
That happiness is different.

1385
01:43:29,530 --> 01:43:29,940
Arun.

1386
01:43:30,350 --> 01:43:33,650
Since dad came here you couldn't
spend time with him.

1387
01:43:34,770 --> 01:43:37,740
Take a day off tomorrow.
All of us shall go out.

1388
01:43:38,960 --> 01:43:42,670
No Pallavi, I'm going to Santa
monica on a business trip.

1389
01:43:43,020 --> 01:43:44,980
Then we will come with
you to Santa monica.

1390
01:43:46,680 --> 01:43:50,070
I heard Venice beach is really beautiful.
- No Pallavi.

1391
01:43:50,630 --> 01:43:52,240
I will be busy in project work.

1392
01:43:53,200 --> 01:43:55,380
Son-in-law is busy, let him be.

1393
01:43:55,940 --> 01:43:59,110
No dad, he keeps going regularly,
but he never takes me.

1394
01:43:59,180 --> 01:44:00,820
But this time we are going, That's it.

1395
01:44:01,060 --> 01:44:03,530
It's not about that Pallavi.
- No we are also coming. Thats it.

1396
01:44:04,830 --> 01:44:05,270
Okay.

1397
01:44:06,750 --> 01:44:07,190
Okay.

1398
01:44:08,140 --> 01:44:10,090
Final? Very good.

1399
01:44:10,860 --> 01:44:13,180
Hey Calculation, why don't you join us.

1400
01:44:13,590 --> 01:44:14,250
Why me?

1401
01:44:19,340 --> 01:44:22,090
You're going out with family.
I don't want to disturb.

1402
01:44:22,290 --> 01:44:24,260
You are just like our family.

1403
01:44:25,100 --> 01:44:27,560
Hey Penthouse, the girls
in the American beach...

1404
01:44:29,740 --> 01:44:31,440
They are very traditional.
- Eat.

1405
01:44:31,890 --> 01:44:32,960
You're coming too.

1406
01:44:43,880 --> 01:44:45,440
Dad, do you want me to play a song?

1407
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:47,330
A song.
- Yes.

1408
01:44:57,550 --> 01:45:00,020
Brother, not this song please.

1409
01:45:01,790 --> 01:45:02,490
What, Uma?

1410
01:45:03,730 --> 01:45:05,200
Watch the sceneries and enjoy.

1411
01:45:05,540 --> 01:45:09,520
When my son-in-law spared so much cash
on the trip, why are you so low?.

1412
01:45:09,720 --> 01:45:12,430
Father-in-law, he is really lucky.

1413
01:45:13,100 --> 01:45:16,630
Is it ordinary to sit with us and
be on the same trip as us?

1414
01:45:17,510 --> 01:45:19,530
As if you are from the Tippu Sultan family...
- What?

1415
01:45:20,160 --> 01:45:20,660
Nothing.

1416
01:45:20,910 --> 01:45:23,670
Father-in-law,
Arun must have gotten him his job too.

1417
01:45:23,880 --> 01:45:26,720
- No. Uma is very talented.
- Thank you, Arun.

1418
01:45:27,450 --> 01:45:28,690
What's that talent we don't know.

1419
01:45:29,280 --> 01:45:31,660
His fate changed after he
came to our pent house.

1420
01:45:36,220 --> 01:45:39,000
Wow! Location is amazing, father-in-law.
Pent house...

1421
01:45:39,320 --> 01:45:40,670
Come.. let's take a self

1422
01:45:40,910 --> 01:45:42,630
Not self. It's a selfie.

1423
01:45:43,060 --> 01:45:43,960
Whatever. come.

1424
01:45:46,320 --> 01:45:47,870
Location's to that's side.
- That is why I put it that way.

1425
01:45:48,660 --> 01:45:49,630
Hats off, sir.
- Thank you.

1426
01:45:52,600 --> 01:45:54,040
Wait, smile a bit.

1427
01:46:00,980 --> 01:46:04,380
Uncle,
I booked three rooms. I will get the keys.

1428
01:46:04,570 --> 01:46:06,960
Why three rooms, son?
You both can stay in a room.

1429
01:46:07,720 --> 01:46:09,550
Pent house will adjust with us.

1430
01:46:11,070 --> 01:46:12,380
We will get an extra bed.

1431
01:46:13,110 --> 01:46:14,570
Is it okay for you?
- Okay?

1432
01:46:14,860 --> 01:46:17,040
Isn't he fortune to sleep amongst us,
father-in-law?

1433
01:46:18,940 --> 01:46:22,410
In between?
- Between.

1434
01:46:22,500 --> 01:46:23,950
Hey, let's go.
- Come.

1435
01:46:33,390 --> 01:46:35,040
Father-in-law, this is for you.

1436
01:46:39,700 --> 01:46:40,480
That's good, uncle.

1437
01:46:42,800 --> 01:46:43,080
Uma...

1438
01:46:44,120 --> 01:46:45,700
Why don't you join us?
come.

1439
01:46:47,250 --> 01:46:49,300
Who will handover the
ball if everyone plays?

1440
01:46:51,830 --> 01:46:53,620
Hey pent house...
- It's okay, sir.

1441
01:46:53,780 --> 01:46:54,300
Give me the ball.

1442
01:46:55,790 --> 01:46:56,330
Give.

1443
01:47:05,180 --> 01:47:07,970
<<Phone ringing>>

1444
01:47:07,990 --> 01:47:09,340
Pallavi, just a second.

1445
01:47:14,350 --> 01:47:15,730
Pallavi, I have to go.
- What?

1446
01:47:16,330 --> 01:47:18,230
I have a client waiting in the coffee shop.

1447
01:47:18,430 --> 01:47:19,450
I'll talk to him and come.

1448
01:47:20,540 --> 01:47:22,940
Uncle, I will be right back.
See you.

1449
01:47:24,220 --> 01:47:24,790
Uma...

1450
01:47:25,760 --> 01:47:26,580
Come and join us

1451
01:47:27,990 --> 01:47:29,780
Come on... Joker of the game.

1452
01:47:38,870 --> 01:47:39,690
Throw the ball.

1453
01:47:49,450 --> 01:47:50,420
Hey pass the ball.

1454
01:48:06,500 --> 01:48:08,620
Arun forgot his wallet, dad.
I will give it and come.

1455
01:48:56,290 --> 01:49:00,090
Uma, did you see how lovely
Arun and Pallavi are?

1456
01:49:00,240 --> 01:49:01,610
You have mistaken them.

1457
01:49:01,760 --> 01:49:04,310
He should have some knowledge like
us to understand, father-in-law.

1458
01:49:04,670 --> 01:49:05,180
True...
- Damn!

1459
01:49:07,940 --> 01:49:09,330
Birds... Beautiful birds...

1460
01:49:09,960 --> 01:49:13,140
How long will you stay alone?
Why don't you get married?

1461
01:49:13,320 --> 01:49:14,470
Why bother about my marriage now, sir?

1462
01:49:15,450 --> 01:49:17,200
You are young and employed.

1463
01:49:18,020 --> 01:49:19,700
Why is pent house tensed about marriage?

1464
01:49:20,040 --> 01:49:21,890
Don't. Don't go there.

1465
01:49:22,210 --> 01:49:23,070
Is it?
- Please...

1466
01:49:23,320 --> 01:49:27,540
Uma, if I had another daughter, I would
definitely get her married to you.

1467
01:49:28,940 --> 01:49:31,480
When she was there, you won't and when
she's gone, you give me offers.

1468
01:49:34,250 --> 01:49:36,200
I said it generally.
- I too said it generally.

1469
01:49:39,440 --> 01:49:39,870
Father-in-law,

1470
01:49:41,290 --> 01:49:43,770
Seems like this frame will
fit us both perfectly.

1471
01:49:44,280 --> 01:49:45,530
Shall we go?
- What's there?

1472
01:49:46,760 --> 01:49:49,350
Let's go. Seems calculation
is really annoyed

1473
01:49:54,650 --> 01:50:04,240
<<Phone ringing>>

1474
01:50:04,400 --> 01:50:05,930
Uncle? Uncle to whom?

1475
01:50:08,580 --> 01:50:09,670
Hello...
- Hello.

1476
01:50:10,660 --> 01:50:11,800
Who is it?
- Who are you?

1477
01:50:12,120 --> 01:50:13,540
Who are you?

1478
01:50:13,710 --> 01:50:14,880
Shut up. Who's beside you?

1479
01:50:16,300 --> 01:50:17,490
Hot models. Why?

1480
01:50:17,580 --> 01:50:18,850
Had too much alcohol?

1481
01:50:19,170 --> 01:50:21,190
No. Had too much fire...
Will you send fire engines?

1482
01:50:21,330 --> 01:50:24,000
Shut up and give Mr. Chandramouli the phone

1483
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:24,880
I am Arun's father.

1484
01:50:29,660 --> 01:50:29,860
Sir.

1485
01:50:31,160 --> 01:50:32,030
Someone on the phone...
- Who is it?

1486
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:32,780
Talk, sir

1487
01:50:33,860 --> 01:50:34,230
Hello...

1488
01:50:34,720 --> 01:50:35,290
Brother-in-law...

1489
01:50:35,680 --> 01:50:37,350
How are you, brother-in-law?

1490
01:50:37,630 --> 01:50:41,380
Who was that stupid eating my brain?

1491
01:50:41,960 --> 01:50:42,370
He is our...

1492
01:50:43,680 --> 01:50:44,750
Guess...

1493
01:50:44,940 --> 01:50:46,420
You will be thrilled to know.

1494
01:50:46,840 --> 01:50:47,310
Thrill?

1495
01:50:47,630 --> 01:50:49,530
He studied with your son in Vizag.

1496
01:50:49,820 --> 01:50:51,820
They are best friends.
- Best friends?

1497
01:50:51,870 --> 01:50:56,590
He studied in Dehradun only. He didn't have
friends only let alone a best friend.

1498
01:50:56,910 --> 01:51:00,200
You might be confused.
I am sending you the photograph.

1499
01:51:01,580 --> 01:51:02,610
He might be confused.

1500
01:51:07,770 --> 01:51:09,320
He saw it. Did you recognize?

1501
01:51:09,690 --> 01:51:12,650
Brother-in-law, this is the first
time I am seeing that face.

1502
01:51:12,730 --> 01:51:14,100
Even Arun doesn't know him.

1503
01:51:14,370 --> 01:51:16,410
This guy fooled you well.

1504
01:51:17,870 --> 01:51:18,550
What happened, brother-in-law?

1505
01:51:19,570 --> 01:51:20,440
I will call you back.

1506
01:51:22,970 --> 01:51:25,290
He says Uma and Arun aren't friends.

1507
01:51:26,490 --> 01:51:27,300
Not friends?

1508
01:51:29,220 --> 01:51:30,740
Why is he at Pallavi's house then?

1509
01:51:32,630 --> 01:51:33,040
I don't know.

1510
01:51:35,470 --> 01:51:36,510
Call Kavita immediately.

1511
01:51:42,140 --> 01:51:43,720
Brother-in-law, she's on line.

1512
01:51:44,620 --> 01:51:46,580
Hello... Pallavi tell me.

1513
01:51:46,780 --> 01:51:48,840
I am Pallavi's father.
- Tell me, uncle.

1514
01:51:49,210 --> 01:51:51,990
Why'd you lie to me?
- Which matter, uncle?

1515
01:51:52,340 --> 01:51:54,820
I came to know Uma and Arun aren't friends.

1516
01:51:56,400 --> 01:51:59,010
Not only that. I came to know
everything that's happening here.

1517
01:52:00,450 --> 01:52:02,300
Why did you hide this, Kavita?

1518
01:52:02,780 --> 01:52:05,760
I already told her, uncle.
She didn't listen to me.

1519
01:52:06,040 --> 01:52:09,440
She said Uma is spoiling his life and that
staying with them would change him.

1520
01:52:09,760 --> 01:52:12,800
She convinced me and Arun...

1521
01:52:13,410 --> 01:52:15,420
I'm really so sorry I didn't mean too...

1522
01:52:20,760 --> 01:52:23,780
Pallavi was in love with Uma?

1523
01:52:26,020 --> 01:52:27,980
Which means...
Sanyasi Naidu and Salman Khan...

1524
01:52:48,050 --> 01:52:50,320
Look at the song he is listening to,
father-in-law.

1525
01:52:56,280 --> 01:52:56,670
Hey Uma...

1526
01:53:07,190 --> 01:53:09,240
Why are you dull, Uma?
What happened?

1527
01:53:09,430 --> 01:53:10,380
I will be happy if something happens.

1528
01:53:12,380 --> 01:53:13,240
Nothing's happening.

1529
01:53:25,800 --> 01:53:27,060
How was your meeting with the client?

1530
01:53:28,810 --> 01:53:30,540
Ya, It went well.

1531
01:53:36,580 --> 01:53:37,910
Is the project merger done?

1532
01:53:40,840 --> 01:53:41,620
Almost, Pallavi.

1533
01:53:49,890 --> 01:53:51,930
Were you coming here for this since a year?

1534
01:53:56,300 --> 01:53:56,620
Yes.

1535
01:54:01,400 --> 01:54:05,460
Was the meeting in the client's
office or the parking lot?

1536
01:54:11,550 --> 01:54:12,490
What are you talking about, Pallavi?

1537
01:54:15,190 --> 01:54:15,640
Are you okay?

1538
01:54:19,850 --> 01:54:20,700
Not okay, Arun.

1539
01:54:21,960 --> 01:54:22,700
Something happened, sir.

1540
01:54:28,680 --> 01:54:29,790
Pallavi, why are you shouting?

1541
01:54:30,640 --> 01:54:31,510
I saw you, Arun.

1542
01:54:33,190 --> 01:54:34,420
With that girl in the parking lot...

1543
01:54:39,770 --> 01:54:40,360
Pallavi...

1544
01:54:41,560 --> 01:54:44,440
That girl...
- How could you lie so easily.

1545
01:54:45,280 --> 01:54:45,830
No.

1546
01:54:47,030 --> 01:54:49,590
Don't say you have nothing to do with her.

1547
01:54:49,840 --> 01:54:50,600
I'm not dumb.

1548
01:54:51,430 --> 01:54:52,970
Pallavi, just calm down.
- No.

1549
01:54:53,770 --> 01:54:54,160
No.

1550
01:54:57,150 --> 01:54:59,920
I share everything in my life with you.

1551
01:55:01,170 --> 01:55:03,140
Even about my love...
- Let me talk...

1552
01:55:03,210 --> 01:55:10,120
I called Uma here as he would have
a clarity looking at our love.

1553
01:55:10,350 --> 01:55:12,730
No, Pallavi.
- I now understand, Arun.

1554
01:55:13,830 --> 01:55:16,420
Uma doesn't need clarity. I do.

1555
01:55:18,460 --> 01:55:20,460
I sacrificed my love for you, Arun.

1556
01:55:22,790 --> 01:55:23,170
Tell me.

1557
01:55:24,290 --> 01:55:25,520
How many meetings do you have?

1558
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:28,830
How many tours to go?
Tell me.

1559
01:55:51,550 --> 01:55:52,240
You want to tell something, tell me.

1560
01:55:54,380 --> 01:55:55,750
There is another girl in Arun's life.

1561
01:56:00,010 --> 01:56:00,590
What are you talking about?

1562
01:56:03,380 --> 01:56:04,420
I saw it myself.

1563
01:56:06,230 --> 01:56:07,040
I couldn't believe it.

1564
01:56:09,610 --> 01:56:11,000
He is hiding it since a year.

1565
01:56:12,410 --> 01:56:14,140
He is coming to Santa Monica for her.

1566
01:56:18,180 --> 01:56:20,770
I did a huge mistake getting
married without my will.

1567
01:56:23,250 --> 01:56:24,330
I got the punishment.

1568
01:56:27,240 --> 01:56:29,100
I don't understand whom do
I share my pain with.

1569
01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:33,840
I don't know if sharing helps.

1570
01:56:34,580 --> 01:56:35,760
Why are you telling me then, Pallavi?

1571
01:56:38,350 --> 01:56:40,440
Some things can only be shared
with the ones we love.

1572
01:56:59,290 --> 01:57:05,190
"Hey time!
Answer me and show me the proof"

1573
01:57:05,990 --> 01:57:12,100
"Is it fair of you to just pass along?"

1574
01:57:12,580 --> 01:57:18,790
"Tell me whatÃƒÂ¢s the use of this relation?"

1575
01:57:18,930 --> 01:57:24,990
"Is it possible to know that
in the starting seconds?"

1576
01:57:25,270 --> 01:57:31,000
"I am talking to you, time!"

1577
01:57:32,020 --> 01:57:37,240
"How long do I suffer?"

1578
01:57:39,640 --> 01:57:45,670
"Hey time!
Answer me and show me the proof"

1579
01:57:46,160 --> 01:57:52,260
"Is it fair of you to just pass along?"

1580
01:57:53,090 --> 01:57:54,990
You have to show the bride a star.

1581
01:57:55,210 --> 01:57:57,250
Where is it?
I can't see it.

1582
01:57:57,560 --> 01:57:59,610
Even if it is not here, you should show her.

1583
01:58:01,270 --> 01:58:04,260
I don't want to lie to her.
- It's just an formality.

1584
01:58:05,330 --> 01:58:06,110
Even if it's a formality, I wouldn't do it.

1585
01:58:13,050 --> 01:58:19,080
"As soon as both the hands meet"

1586
01:58:19,700 --> 01:58:25,780
"They say they would live happily together"

1587
01:58:26,480 --> 01:58:32,450
"When our life meets us like our partner"

1588
01:58:33,140 --> 01:58:39,090
"We donÃƒÂ¢t believe in the words
I would never leave you "

1589
01:58:39,100 --> 01:58:45,400
"I am talking to you, time!"

1590
01:58:45,860 --> 01:58:51,960
"How long do I suffer?"

1591
01:59:10,070 --> 01:59:16,020
"Only two ways out and both
are filled with thorns"

1592
01:59:16,790 --> 01:59:22,650
"DonÃƒÂ¢t leave me asking me to choose"

1593
01:59:23,480 --> 01:59:29,190
"As there is some fault in yesterday"

1594
01:59:30,220 --> 01:59:36,070
"We canÃƒÂ¢t leave it as a negative
for tomorrow, right?"

1595
01:59:36,950 --> 01:59:43,080
"Hey time!
Answer me and show me the proof"

1596
01:59:43,550 --> 01:59:49,730
"Is it fair of you to just pass along?"

1597
01:59:50,410 --> 01:59:56,360
"Tell me whatÃƒÂ¢s the use of this relation?"

1598
01:59:56,770 --> 02:00:02,820
"Is it possible to know that
in the starting seconds?"

1599
02:00:03,090 --> 02:00:09,270
"I am talking to you, time!"

1600
02:00:09,640 --> 02:00:15,980
"How long do I suffer?"

1601
02:00:16,450 --> 02:00:22,770
"I am talking to you, time!"

1602
02:00:23,080 --> 02:00:29,690
"How long do I suffer?"

1603
02:00:59,150 --> 02:01:00,390
Why'd you call me, sir?

1604
02:01:02,350 --> 02:01:04,190
I met Pallavi's lover. Uma...

1605
02:01:06,440 --> 02:01:09,290
Where is he, sir?
- Not now.

1606
02:01:10,400 --> 02:01:11,680
A year ago I met him.

1607
02:01:14,330 --> 02:01:17,390
He was on our top floor,
loving my daughter without my notice.

1608
02:01:20,740 --> 02:01:26,100
Valuing a father's words of having
stature to marry the girl he loves.

1609
02:01:26,260 --> 02:01:28,490
He failed in love for his career.

1610
02:01:30,720 --> 02:01:32,710
He is trying to win again.

1611
02:01:36,790 --> 02:01:38,260
I know everything, Uma.

1612
02:01:38,920 --> 02:01:40,810
Pallavi isn't happy with Arun.

1613
02:01:43,760 --> 02:01:45,200
She still loves you.

1614
02:01:47,620 --> 02:01:50,570
As a father, I made a mistake getting
her married without her will.

1615
02:01:52,300 --> 02:01:56,190
God's given me another
chance to make it right.

1616
02:01:58,290 --> 02:01:59,320
Pallavi and Arun...

1617
02:01:59,940 --> 02:02:00,290
No.

1618
02:02:03,200 --> 02:02:04,530
Pallavi and you...

1619
02:02:05,800 --> 02:02:07,700
Correct...
- It's not correct.

1620
02:02:09,010 --> 02:02:09,650
It's not, sir.

1621
02:02:21,090 --> 02:02:23,460
What, bro?
Waiting for girlfriend, huh?

1622
02:02:26,990 --> 02:02:28,800
Santa Monica...

1623
02:02:30,770 --> 02:02:31,320
Is she nice?

1624
02:02:35,210 --> 02:02:36,220
Beautiful than Pallavi?

1625
02:02:37,960 --> 02:02:38,530
Just shut up.

1626
02:02:41,650 --> 02:02:42,490
Angry, huh?

1627
02:02:43,280 --> 02:02:46,590
If you can be angry even after cheating
her with the same lie for a year.

1628
02:02:46,810 --> 02:02:48,230
How angry should Pallavi be?

1629
02:02:49,710 --> 02:02:53,590
How angry should her dad be for
trusting you with her daughter?

1630
02:02:55,810 --> 02:03:01,670
How angry should I be even after
wishing for you both to separate?

1631
02:03:03,970 --> 02:03:05,030
Why will we be angry, brother?

1632
02:03:06,140 --> 02:03:06,840
We shouldn't be.

1633
02:03:10,710 --> 02:03:11,320
Now I understand.

1634
02:03:12,770 --> 02:03:15,790
That I accepted you both as husband
and wife without my notice.

1635
02:03:16,570 --> 02:03:19,570
I thought even God can't separate you both.
But, what have you done?

1636
02:03:19,810 --> 02:03:20,390
What have I done?

1637
02:03:20,930 --> 02:03:21,880
What have I done?

1638
02:03:23,560 --> 02:03:27,070
I am used to being alone since childhood.
I can't easily mingle with anyone.

1639
02:03:28,420 --> 02:03:29,140
No friends too.

1640
02:03:31,720 --> 02:03:33,020
Christi then came into my life.

1641
02:03:35,920 --> 02:03:36,930
My MBA classmate in Stanford.

1642
02:03:38,790 --> 02:03:42,290
She is very expressive.
She would follow her heart.

1643
02:03:44,110 --> 02:03:46,230
We soon became friends.

1644
02:03:49,860 --> 02:03:53,410
I couldn't be free with anyone except her
I would share everything with her.

1645
02:03:54,460 --> 02:03:55,440
She help me to open up.

1646
02:03:56,880 --> 02:03:58,820
I share everything with her.

1647
02:04:00,250 --> 02:04:01,820
I thought I found a best friend.

1648
02:04:07,930 --> 02:04:10,330
But she suddenly proposed
love to me one day.

1649
02:04:10,940 --> 02:04:12,350
I didn't understand how to react.

1650
02:04:13,320 --> 02:04:17,330
I saw a best friend in her but
had no other feelings.

1651
02:04:18,230 --> 02:04:20,340
But her love for me kept increasing.

1652
02:04:22,050 --> 02:04:23,550
She met me even after MBA was completed.

1653
02:04:24,960 --> 02:04:28,130
Then I completely avoided her.

1654
02:04:31,540 --> 02:04:33,230
I knew after I got married with Pallavi.

1655
02:04:34,070 --> 02:04:35,940
She got depressed and turned
into a drug addict.

1656
02:04:36,950 --> 02:04:38,050
She attempted suicide.

1657
02:04:42,690 --> 02:04:43,790
I couldn't bear it.

1658
02:04:44,230 --> 02:04:46,840
I felt I am the reason for that.

1659
02:04:47,890 --> 02:04:50,240
I felt guilty.

1660
02:04:51,560 --> 02:04:54,150
I am trying my best as a friend
to bring her back to normal.

1661
02:04:55,950 --> 02:04:59,780
Will any husband agree to his wife calling
her lover home as his life isn't spoiled?

1662
02:05:01,030 --> 02:05:01,780
I did.

1663
02:05:02,890 --> 02:05:03,610
You know why?

1664
02:05:05,580 --> 02:05:06,150
Why?

1665
02:05:06,950 --> 02:05:08,940
I saw Christi in you.

1666
02:05:10,860 --> 02:05:12,910
I didn't want your
life to be like Christi's.

1667
02:05:22,700 --> 02:05:24,130
Why don't you tell Pallavi this?

1668
02:05:24,360 --> 02:05:26,970
I felt it's unnecessary to
tell and disturb her.

1669
02:05:28,200 --> 02:05:29,800
When the situation came,

1670
02:05:31,100 --> 02:05:32,300
The way she spoke.

1671
02:05:34,390 --> 02:05:35,440
I couldn't tell her.

1672
02:05:36,820 --> 02:05:37,440
That minute.

1673
02:05:39,320 --> 02:05:40,800
When she spoke differently,

1674
02:05:43,010 --> 02:05:44,610
I felt dead.

1675
02:05:47,040 --> 02:05:48,340
I can't live without her.

1676
02:05:50,270 --> 02:05:51,130
She is my life.

1677
02:06:02,850 --> 02:06:03,400
Let's go.

1678
02:06:03,880 --> 02:06:05,910
Let's tell Pallavi this. Arun and Pallavi can...
- Who are we, sir?

1679
02:06:08,060 --> 02:06:09,480
Who are we in between husband and wife?

1680
02:06:10,420 --> 02:06:11,580
This ain't our problem, sir.

1681
02:06:18,800 --> 02:06:20,450
Let's wait for Arun.

1682
02:06:20,820 --> 02:06:22,950
No, dad. He might have eaten outside.
You continue.

1683
02:06:25,190 --> 02:06:25,720
Brother,

1684
02:06:26,270 --> 02:06:27,770
You are on time.
Come. Let's eat.

1685
02:06:28,290 --> 02:06:29,350
I already had.

1686
02:06:36,640 --> 02:06:37,410
What is this?

1687
02:06:38,220 --> 02:06:41,620
I don't like this.
Seems he is also roaming with some girl.

1688
02:06:43,570 --> 02:06:46,270
Pallavi, father-in-law knows everything.

1689
02:06:48,220 --> 02:06:50,280
He also knows Uma and you were in love.

1690
02:06:53,560 --> 02:06:57,190
Look, dear. Listen to me and divorce him.
- Dad...

1691
02:06:57,890 --> 02:06:58,700
Marry Uma.

1692
02:07:00,140 --> 02:07:02,110
Uma, are you fine with it?
- I am always okay with it.

1693
02:07:03,790 --> 02:07:05,390
Seems Pallavi is confused.

1694
02:07:06,670 --> 02:07:08,200
She thinks Arun still loves her.

1695
02:07:09,220 --> 02:07:11,980
If he really loved you,
would he let me stay here for 10 days?

1696
02:07:12,100 --> 02:07:14,580
If he really loved you,
would he not doubt us at least once?

1697
02:07:14,800 --> 02:07:16,340
He has no interest, no love.

1698
02:07:16,790 --> 02:07:17,530
What does he think?

1699
02:07:18,740 --> 02:07:21,030
He doesn't need Pallavi or
he need not doubt her?

1700
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:26,140
I might be confused.

1701
02:07:28,190 --> 02:07:29,030
Anyways, I am ready sir.

1702
02:07:29,640 --> 02:07:31,180
I am okay with it if she is.
- I am okay with it.

1703
02:07:32,060 --> 02:07:34,120
Listen to me.
Arun isn't correct for you.

1704
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:38,310
It's better to separate happily
than stay together fighting.

1705
02:07:38,310 --> 02:07:39,760
What do you say, Uma?
- Correct, sir.

1706
02:07:40,710 --> 02:07:43,660
It isnÃƒÂ¢t a big issue for your
generation to separate anyways.

1707
02:07:44,340 --> 02:07:46,260
You say yes and I will take care
of the rest. Pallavi...

1708
02:07:52,680 --> 02:07:53,100
Pallavi...

1709
02:08:02,900 --> 02:08:03,860
Where are you going, Arun?

1710
02:08:05,160 --> 02:08:06,120
Far away from you.

1711
02:08:11,900 --> 02:08:12,940
Pallavi, stop it.

1712
02:08:13,470 --> 02:08:14,030
Stop it, Pallavi.

1713
02:08:14,540 --> 02:08:16,600
I am telling you. Stop it,

1714
02:08:36,670 --> 02:08:38,750
You want to leave me.

1715
02:08:41,060 --> 02:08:42,390
Why do you still need this?

1716
02:08:49,820 --> 02:08:52,130
Will you leave as I asked who the girl is?

1717
02:08:55,090 --> 02:08:59,780
I spoke so that day as I didn't want
any other girl in your heart.

1718
02:09:00,400 --> 02:09:03,710
With that pain I spoke that way.

1719
02:09:08,530 --> 02:09:13,040
Couldn't you see my love in that?

1720
02:09:24,930 --> 02:09:25,310
Arun.

1721
02:09:28,420 --> 02:09:30,530
I am not bothered about this world.

1722
02:09:33,470 --> 02:09:34,050
You tell me.

1723
02:09:35,230 --> 02:09:36,420
Say one word. That's all.

1724
02:09:37,880 --> 02:09:41,120
What I saw that day, was it true or not?

1725
02:09:43,590 --> 02:09:44,150
No.

1726
02:09:51,050 --> 02:09:53,040
There's no one in my life except you.

1727
02:09:56,810 --> 02:09:57,720
You are my life.

1728
02:10:04,260 --> 02:10:04,790
Look...

1729
02:10:06,700 --> 02:10:07,480
This is life, sir.

1730
02:10:10,710 --> 02:10:12,120
Love has nothing to do with marriage.

1731
02:10:13,670 --> 02:10:14,760
Marriage doesn't need love, sir.

1732
02:10:16,550 --> 02:10:20,460
You wanted the girl you loved to
have a happy life and family.

1733
02:10:22,190 --> 02:10:24,980
Your love is truly sincere.
- My love is nothing.

1734
02:10:27,780 --> 02:10:31,170
People donÃƒÂ¢t even bother about
their lovers after marriage.

1735
02:10:33,940 --> 02:10:35,140
Pallavi who wished for my life.

1736
02:10:36,350 --> 02:10:37,530
Arun for saving Christi's live.

1737
02:10:38,590 --> 02:10:40,080
My love is nothing compared to them.

1738
02:10:42,940 --> 02:10:44,090
It's just a memory.

1739
02:10:49,230 --> 02:10:51,200
I thought my life was done
before I came here.

1740
02:10:52,270 --> 02:10:53,690
I came looking for it.

1741
02:10:55,350 --> 02:10:57,830
But after watching Arun and Pallavi,
I understood.

1742
02:10:59,650 --> 02:11:01,180
Our life is always with us, sir.

1743
02:11:02,290 --> 02:11:03,670
We need not look for it elsewhere.

1744
02:11:10,970 --> 02:11:13,040
It's enough if you accept
it like Pallavi did.

1745
02:11:14,470 --> 02:11:16,270
Life becomes beautiful, sir.

1746
02:11:20,980 --> 02:11:25,600
Life throws many chances at us.
We have to give it a chance.

1747
02:11:29,460 --> 02:11:30,380
I will, sir.

1748
02:11:35,250 --> 02:11:35,940
Where to, Uma?

1749
02:11:41,820 --> 02:11:42,940
I understood, sir.

1750
02:11:44,090 --> 02:11:46,560
I need to explain it to the
Uma Maheswararao inside.

1751
02:11:48,560 --> 02:11:50,310
Give him ten minutes
and he will settle, sir.

1752
02:12:39,830 --> 02:12:40,900
Pallavi.
- Yes.

1753
02:12:41,770 --> 02:12:44,170
I want to ask you about something.
- What is it, mother?

1754
02:12:45,050 --> 02:12:47,920
Do you know Suguna's sister daughter Raji.
- Yes I know.

1755
02:12:48,870 --> 02:12:52,020
What do you say about getting
her married to Uma.

1756
02:12:54,200 --> 02:12:54,870
Uma?

1757
02:12:55,300 --> 02:12:57,680
He doesn't drink nor has any love stories.

1758
02:12:57,980 --> 02:12:59,050
He is very good guy.

1759
02:13:00,100 --> 02:13:00,700
What?

1760
02:13:02,930 --> 02:13:04,330
Yes, it will be good.

1761
02:13:10,400 --> 02:13:12,630
Hi Uma...
- I didn't expect that you would come.

1762
02:13:13,630 --> 02:13:17,150
Festival should be celebrated with Family,
I don't have any.

1763
02:13:18,590 --> 02:13:19,400
Will you go to your uncle?

1764
02:13:20,370 --> 02:13:22,590
Hey, come on...

1765
02:13:25,090 --> 02:13:27,610
No need, your ladies won't come near me.
I understood.

1766
02:13:27,730 --> 02:13:29,740
Hey Uma,
when will you feed us some Dal rice.

1767
02:13:30,060 --> 02:13:31,850
I meant when will you get married.
- Take.

1768
02:13:31,920 --> 02:13:34,390
We have a very good girl in our relatives.

1769
02:13:36,530 --> 02:13:38,580
Recently I met a girl on Facebook.
She is from Vizag.

1770
02:13:39,120 --> 02:13:41,340
We are just chatting and will
meet her this weekend.

1771
02:13:41,600 --> 02:13:44,120
Uma, you never mentioned about it.
Is she good looking?

1772
02:13:44,680 --> 02:13:46,310
Deepika Padukone.
- Is she really that good.

1773
02:13:46,530 --> 02:13:47,860
I don't know. That was her display picture.

1774
02:13:48,950 --> 02:13:51,280
How can you decide that on
Facebook without seeing her.

1775
02:13:51,500 --> 02:13:53,500
Our hearts should meet looks
don't matter to me.

1776
02:13:55,390 --> 02:13:58,780
Okay, but when will you meet,
love and marry?

1777
02:14:01,820 --> 02:14:03,040
We will marry and then love each other sir.

1778
02:14:04,820 --> 02:14:07,200
Great words.
- Find out if it's a boy or girl.

1779
02:14:07,360 --> 02:14:09,100
Sir, don't put these doubts in my head.
