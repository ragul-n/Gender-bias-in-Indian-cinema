1
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:44,239
- Headed home, Patrik?
- Huh?

2
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:46,479
Headed home? You coming back?

3
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:49,199
I've got the kids this week,
so I'm taking it easy.

4
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:51,679
Had fun?

5
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:53,039
Have you had fun?

6
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:57,559
It's lottery number 1970 -
one thousand nine hundred seventy...

7
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:28,799
AMATEURS

8
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:32,479
<i>The Viskan stream snakes its way down
to the textile empire and the west coast.</i>

9
00:02:32,679 --> 00:02:38,199
<i>Wherever there are rapids, people have
gathered to harness this force of nature.</i>

10
00:02:38,399 --> 00:02:41,759
<i>And thus the industrial town
of Lafors came to be.</i>

11
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:44,599
<i>The people of Lafors have thick skin.</i>

12
00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:48,839
<i>Working these steaming cowhides
are the cowboys of Lafors</i>

13
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:51,359
<i>who produce top-quality leather.</i>

14
00:02:51,559 --> 00:02:54,719
<i>You'd be forgiven to think
this was the wild west</i>

15
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:58,879
<i>but it isn't, even if life in Lafors
can be just as exciting.</i>

16
00:03:00,359 --> 00:03:03,039
<i>Sweden, little over 50 years ago.</i>

17
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:07,239
<i>Almost half the population are farmers.</i>

18
00:03:09,119 --> 00:03:13,639
<i>A far cry from the factory, Where
everyone worships at the altar of labor</i>

19
00:03:13,839 --> 00:03:17,519
<i>and in the sewing factories,
mass production is underway.</i>

20
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:21,959
<i>These hard workers are assisted
by top-of-the-line machines.</i>

21
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,639
<i>Good fit, good quality, good price.
It's the mass that does it.</i>

22
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,559
<i>They say Lafors depends on
their leather and textile industry.</i>

23
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:33,239
<i>You'd bet your life it does.</i>

24
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:24,679
<i>- Aida, where is your dirty laundry?
- Check the bathroom.</i>

25
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:28,599
<i>- I've already checked there.
- Then I don't know.</i>

26
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:40,559
OK... so what do we do now?

27
00:04:57,119 --> 00:04:59,839
- Those look good.
- They're from Eva's cafÃ©.

28
00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:01,119
Fancy!

29
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:04,639
Everyone has the agenda
from the last meeting.

30
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:07,159
- Will you get me some, honey?
- Of course.

31
00:05:07,359 --> 00:05:13,359
Will you hand me a mug too, Lasse?
I don't want to share Musse's Riga mug.

32
00:05:13,559 --> 00:05:17,719
- It's as dirty as the streets of Riga.
- Gotta represent our sister town?

33
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,239
- I hope you wash It occasionally.
- Never.

34
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:24,919
This is what's happening.
This is huge.

35
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:31,559
As you know, since February
we've been in continuous talks...

36
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,959
with this German
low-cost superstore...

37
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:38,559
- Superbilly.
- Right.

38
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:40,719
And...

39
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:45,839
we've offered them a solution
for their establishment.

40
00:05:45,999 --> 00:05:50,399
They're very happy about
the geographical location, logistically.

41
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:58,359
The land here is also very
attractively priced for their purposes.

42
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:02,959
What this all means,
is that the Town of Lafors...

43
00:06:03,159 --> 00:06:06,719
is one of two...
- Are you serious?

44
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:09,519
Possible establishment sites.

45
00:06:09,719 --> 00:06:13,999
And we are up against... Alingsas.

46
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:16,319
"Potato Town?"

47
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:20,919
In terms of cold, hard numbers,
what would this mean for jobs?

48
00:06:21,119 --> 00:06:22,999
500 employees.

49
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:28,079
But it will also generate a lot of job
opportunities for contractors and so on.

50
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:32,279
So I think we estimated between
900 and 1,200 new jobs.

51
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,159
It's an insane amount of jobs.

52
00:06:35,359 --> 00:06:37,439
- Amazing.
- Not bad at all.

53
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:41,439
I don't really need to tell you this,

54
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:46,239
but this is a fantastic opportunity.

55
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:49,319
- I'm sure you all realize that.
- Absolutely.

56
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:53,639
So we really need to put
our best foot forward here.

57
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:56,079
In every possible way.

58
00:06:56,279 --> 00:07:02,839
Because in a month's time, a delegation
from Superbilly will come to visit us.

59
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:07,759
So we need to sell our town,
and put Lafors on the map.

60
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:10,239
How do we do that?
Any good ideas?

61
00:07:19,559 --> 00:07:21,839
We need to do something
about our website.

62
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:28,199
This bugs me.
When you google Lafors

63
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:31,719
all you get are a bunch of drunken clips
from that Western weekend.

64
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,439
Before our official website.

65
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,559
I've been saying for a year
we need to do something about that.

66
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,119
We can't force people to remove them.
We have no legal right to.

67
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:43,759
I know, but have you
seen the comments?

68
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:47,759
We'll have to create our own image
of our town. Our view of it.

69
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:49,759
Let's make our own film.

70
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:53,999
There are so many towns
that do this. I'll show you.

71
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:02,159
<i>Nowhere is as pretty as Tallkopinge..</i>

72
00:08:04,119 --> 00:08:06,959
<i>Our motto is quality of life.</i>

73
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:13,679
<i>Take your whole family on an adventure
and enjoy life, here in Tallkopinge...</i>

74
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:16,399
- A cow!
- Yes...

75
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:19,719
But isn't this film a little too...

76
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,639
Isn't it kind of shitty?

77
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:25,359
It's an example.
It doesn't have to be this.

78
00:08:25,559 --> 00:08:28,599
- Hang on now...
- We need to be much more daring.

79
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:31,399
There's an economic aspect to consider.

80
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:35,079
A thing like this, it costs money.
We need to hire a...

81
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,759
There's no money left
in our arts and culture budget.

82
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:42,639
OK, so...
I might have an idea.

83
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:49,679
30 DAYS LEFT

84
00:09:16,719 --> 00:09:19,319
We'll let Musse state
the reason he's here.

85
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,839
I'm so darn happy to be here.

86
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:26,839
I've got a pretty exciting,
and pretty big, question for you guys.

87
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,639
And it's this...

88
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:33,279
Who here would like
to save a community?

89
00:09:38,479 --> 00:09:42,679
- That's an amazing offer...
- Let me fill you in a little bit.

90
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:46,959
This may be pretty hard
for you guys to take in, but...

91
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:54,079
We're currently in talks
with a German low-cost superstore.

92
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:57,799
And maybe, just maybe,
there's a chance they'll come here.

93
00:09:57,999 --> 00:10:00,319
- Like the superstore in Ullared?
- Kind of, yes.

94
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:04,119
Lots of cheap goods.
Clothes, shoes, bags.

95
00:10:04,319 --> 00:10:08,759
But right now they're choosing
between us and Alingsas.

96
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,359
And darn it, we don't want
Alingsas-is to get it, do we?

97
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:14,319
- Right?

98
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:16,959
Wouldn't that be just terrible?

99
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:22,119
So that's why we need your help
to make a film about Lafors.

100
00:10:22,359 --> 00:10:26,679
We need a new image
that shows how great Lafors is.

101
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:30,679
Right, and there is no limit
to what you could do.

102
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:33,479
I mean, this is a super exciting project.

103
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:35,999
- You said they'd use their phones?
- Yes.

104
00:10:36,199 --> 00:10:40,959
It's a democratic tool.
A chance to showcase your vision.

105
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:44,399
Your story.
What you find interesting.

106
00:10:44,599 --> 00:10:47,279
- That In Itself Is an honor.
- Exactly.

107
00:10:47,479 --> 00:10:52,639
There are so many stories out there.
I don't want to limit your vision.

108
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:57,559
Find the story you want tell,
and just go for it.

109
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:03,159
Superbilly!

110
00:11:09,479 --> 00:11:12,399
What should we film?

111
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:21,119
This is Dana and Aida's film about Lafors.

112
00:11:25,199 --> 00:11:31,159
Here it is, the roundabout elk.
The pride of Lafors.

113
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:42,119
Hi. May we film you?

114
00:11:42,319 --> 00:11:43,639
What...?

115
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:48,559
We're shooting
a local government film.

116
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:50,919
- And you want me to be in it?
- Yes!

117
00:11:51,119 --> 00:11:53,599
- Why?
- Because you live In Lafors.

118
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:56,279
- Yeah, I suppose...
- Everyone counts to us.

119
00:11:56,479 --> 00:11:59,399
- Why are you so fancy?
- Are you off to a party?

120
00:11:59,599 --> 00:12:01,119
- These are my work clothes.
- Oh.

121
00:12:01,319 --> 00:12:03,199
Why do you have such a nice car?

122
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:05,239
Are you rich?

123
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:12,439
This is the Lafors fountain.

124
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,359
It is forbidden to pour dish soap...

125
00:12:15,439 --> 00:12:16,719
So cute!

126
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:19,559
Good! There we go!

127
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:21,359
Are you on your periods?

128
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:32,119
The 19703 was the heyday. Back then
we had the Lafors crayfish party.

129
00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:36,599
We had big names like ABBA here.

130
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:40,359
Right before they hit it big
with <i>Waterloo.</i>

131
00:12:40,599 --> 00:12:46,839
Jerry Williams was here.
Lill-Babs was here.

132
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:50,559
Rockfolket...
Bertil Bertilsson and "Burken."

133
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:55,159
We've had lots of great artists here.

134
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:57,839
- The Goinge Girls.
- The Goinge Girls!

135
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:05,279
- What a beautiful butt!
- Thanks.

136
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:10,879
Sassy.

137
00:13:18,199 --> 00:13:19,479
Can you see my contact lens?

138
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:21,079
I've got one there...

139
00:13:22,439 --> 00:13:23,439
There!

140
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,159
What did you do there?

141
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:36,959
- Poor Aida! Habibi!
- I know...

142
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:40,079
But then I became friends with them
and we went on adventures.

143
00:13:40,239 --> 00:13:42,239
- What happened?
- I'm telling you!

144
00:13:51,119 --> 00:13:55,199
Aida. The kid from Skane...

145
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,679
What is the point of this film?
I don't get it.

146
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:05,639
You don't get what's cool.
You're too old.

147
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:10,079
Old? How old do you think I am?

148
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:13,399
Honestly, Aida,
it's time for you to grow up.

149
00:14:13,599 --> 00:14:16,999
- What do you mean, grow up?
- Your parents should see you.

150
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:18,719
Your head is a little...

151
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:22,679
- What are you doing? Come here!
- No, I don't want to.

152
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:25,759
<i>- You're small and need to learn boxing.
- Teach me!</i>

153
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:27,879
<i>It's me you have to teach!</i>

154
00:14:28,119 --> 00:14:31,399
<i>- Come on!
- Habibi...</i>

155
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:36,239
LAFORS COUNCIL

156
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:46,519
<i>- Can you clean the break room?
- OK.</i>

157
00:14:54,999 --> 00:14:57,079
Oh...

158
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:04,039
WELCOME TO LAFORS

159
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:31,479
OK, what is your job
as the town council boss?

160
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:36,799
I do this, and I do this...

161
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:39,159
this...

162
00:15:40,119 --> 00:15:41,559
this.

163
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,199
What else?

164
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,839
- I don't just work here.
- Oh?

165
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:51,319
I also clean.

166
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:56,279
At the Solforsen home
for the elderly, at the library...

167
00:15:56,479 --> 00:15:59,559
What's the most Lafors thing
according to you?

168
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:07,839
<i>Say it in Arabic if it's easier.</i>

169
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:17,839
<i>Maybe the air, the wind,
the sound of the water...</i>

170
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:23,039
<i>the shape of the fountain...
Julia street...</i>

171
00:16:23,239 --> 00:16:27,879
<i>- It gives you this feeling... feeling...</i>
- Such a poet!

172
00:16:28,119 --> 00:16:29,399
<i>Of peace.</i>

173
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:33,319
Hey! What are you two up to?

174
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,919
We're filming.

175
00:16:41,319 --> 00:16:42,679
And action!

176
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:26,879
<i>That's enough.
Put the CD player back.</i>

177
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,439
<i>We need to move on.</i>

178
00:17:32,879 --> 00:17:36,519
Miss Dana, if you please...

179
00:17:36,719 --> 00:17:40,559
So this is the oldest cafÃ© in Lafors.

180
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:43,279
And pretty much only cafÃ©.

181
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:47,799
Everyone who comes here
needs to eat here. Then I get money.

182
00:17:47,999 --> 00:17:50,999
Turn the camera around.
That looks stupid.

183
00:17:51,199 --> 00:17:53,559
Are you going to watch it like this?

184
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:57,719
- It's supposed to be like that.
- No. This is how you do it.

185
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,159
- Then you can't see the whole person.
- That's how amateurs do it.

186
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:07,439
OK. Shall we go inside?

187
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:13,759
Danish, cinnamon bread,
Thomas Ravelli cookies,

188
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:17,519
- saffron bread, almond tarts...
- Slower. Hang on.

189
00:18:17,719 --> 00:18:21,359
- One more time, but slower.
- OK.

190
00:18:22,199 --> 00:18:25,359
Danish, cinnamon bread,
Thomas Ravelli cookies,

191
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:31,119
saffron bread, fancy almond tarts,
raspberry tarts, carrot cake,

192
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:36,839
chocolate balls, Prince Bertil macaroons,
mocha cake - which is gluten-free,

193
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:40,039
latte cake, Grandma's squares...

194
00:18:40,239 --> 00:18:45,679
My specialties are Ã©clairs, pÃ©tits choux
pains au chocolat, fraise noix...

195
00:18:45,879 --> 00:18:49,279
But the hillbillies here in Lafors
have no idea what they are.

196
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:56,239
<i>Mom, can't you tell us
about the history of the cafÃ©?</i>

197
00:18:56,439 --> 00:19:01,359
Well, it's the oldest cafÃ© in the region.

198
00:19:02,199 --> 00:19:06,519
It's been here for 108 years,
here in this house.

199
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:25,479
- It's gonna be so good!
- Serious?

200
00:19:25,719 --> 00:19:28,399
Yes! I die for this movie, it's awesome.

201
00:19:28,599 --> 00:19:30,479
The Germans will love it.

202
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:37,559
21 DAYS LEFT

203
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:39,279
Look!

204
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:43,919
- The worst thing is I wrote it myself.
- This, too?

205
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:45,439
SCABIES

206
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:48,079
Hello. I'm Dan.

207
00:19:49,399 --> 00:19:50,759
Right.

208
00:19:52,199 --> 00:19:54,599
You'll see in these films...

209
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:58,559
that they've really gone
with a personal point of view.

210
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:01,879
This is so exciting!

211
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,039
OK, let's start.

212
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:12,319
<i>Welcome to Lafors.</i>

213
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:14,559
<i>- It's dangerous here.
- So are we.</i>

214
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:17,879
<i>- This is our hood.
- Keep yourself away from here.</i>

215
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:22,359
<i>- Hey, bro. You got my stuff?
- Yeah, bro.</i>

216
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:23,839
<i>How much is it?</i>

217
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:28,159
<i>- Freezel
- Cover me! Cover me!</i>

218
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:32,399
<i>- Where's the money?
- Fillip?</i>

219
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:34,799
<i>Talk, man! Talk!
Filip! Filip!</i>

220
00:20:34,999 --> 00:20:37,399
<i>No!!! Wake up, man!</i>

221
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:43,759
Um... shall we maybe move on
to the next film?

222
00:20:43,959 --> 00:20:44,959
Absolutely.

223
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:49,679
OK...

224
00:20:49,879 --> 00:20:52,679
I'm really looking forward
to the next one.

225
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:56,319
So here is the next one.

226
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:03,599
<i>Why does the sun shine
when it hurts so much inside?</i>

227
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,559
<i>Why do I live here?
Nobody understands me here.</i>

228
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:11,559
<i>The people here are all the same.</i>

229
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:16,239
<i>If you're at all different,
you're weird and just all wrong.</i>

230
00:21:16,439 --> 00:21:20,039
<i>- If I'm not wanted, I may just...</i>
- Shall <i>we</i> move <i>on?</i>

231
00:21:20,239 --> 00:21:24,319
OK. Let's do that...

232
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:29,799
<i>Danish, cinnamon bread,
Thomas Ravelli cookies,</i>

233
00:21:29,999 --> 00:21:32,599
<i>mocha cake</i> - <i>which Is gluten-flee,
latte cake...</i>

234
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,119
Fun.

235
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:39,559
What the...?

236
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:42,959
That looks like our offices.
Looks like our cleaner.

237
00:21:43,159 --> 00:21:45,959
It's because those are our offices, Lasse.

238
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,279
Kerstin, thank you very much.

239
00:21:51,639 --> 00:21:54,279
But... there's just one film left.

240
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:07,799
Well...

241
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:14,959
Hello!

242
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:17,639
- Hey there!
- Hi, girls.

243
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:20,159
- How did you like the film?
- What?

244
00:22:20,359 --> 00:22:22,399
Should we upload something or...?

245
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:25,239
You better not upload anything, OK?

246
00:22:25,439 --> 00:22:29,159
No one will upload anything
until they get here, girls.

247
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:32,959
I liked the part in our offices
with the cleaning.

248
00:22:33,159 --> 00:22:36,719
You were a bit naughty there.
That was fun.

249
00:22:37,999 --> 00:22:41,039
- &III
- 50 are we done now, or...?

250
00:22:41,239 --> 00:22:46,079
I speak for all of us when I say it's been
so darn fun watching these films.

251
00:22:46,279 --> 00:22:49,079
Your commitment and...
Just so great!

252
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:51,999
You're the best!
Amazing, girls!

253
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:55,439
Watch out, Hollywood!

254
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:24,519
OK, go.
Put it in there.

255
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:28,599
Hang on, hang on...

256
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:32,039
- OK. We're fucking geniuses!
- Let's do it.

257
00:23:53,439 --> 00:23:56,239
I mean, take it seriously.

258
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:59,639
Film our society.

259
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:02,919
Film something else,
what you see on the street.

260
00:24:05,199 --> 00:24:08,039
Something meaningful.

261
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:11,759
- The council people like it.
- They said so?

262
00:24:11,959 --> 00:24:13,359
They thought it was awesome.

263
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:44,479
- Hi, Kerstin. Nice to see you.
- Hi.

264
00:24:44,679 --> 00:24:46,319
- You good?
- Yes. This is Roland.

265
00:24:46,479 --> 00:24:49,559
- Hi! Welcome to Lafors.
- Hi. Roland.

266
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:51,639
- I'm looking forward to this.
- I'll take this.

267
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:53,039
Take this. It's heavy...

268
00:24:53,239 --> 00:24:55,919
This looks like real
top-of-the-line stuff.

269
00:24:56,079 --> 00:25:00,599
- It Is. This Is a big production, right?
- You bet.

270
00:25:01,439 --> 00:25:02,959
Hollywood, here we come.

271
00:25:03,159 --> 00:25:05,399
Right. So...

272
00:25:08,199 --> 00:25:10,319
- Good luck now, honey.
- Yeah, yeah...

273
00:25:10,479 --> 00:25:12,239
15 DAYS LEFT

274
00:25:12,439 --> 00:25:16,439
The main thing we've got
are major industries...

275
00:25:16,639 --> 00:25:23,319
The textile factory and the tannery are
what have helped create our identity.

276
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:27,239
And they are in a downward trend...

277
00:25:27,439 --> 00:25:33,199
The kinds of jobs we used to have
before have been outsourced to...

278
00:25:33,399 --> 00:25:35,399
- Bangladesh, the third world...
- Right.

279
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:38,799
It's all been relocated down there now.

280
00:25:38,999 --> 00:25:43,239
- We need some positive vibes.
- Definitely.

281
00:25:43,439 --> 00:25:45,479
We want to feel pride again.

282
00:25:50,719 --> 00:25:52,439
Gorgeous.

283
00:25:52,639 --> 00:25:56,119
- They love these views in Germany.
- Yeah, it's nice.

284
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:02,519
At first we were going
to use Kerstin's pupils.

285
00:26:02,719 --> 00:26:06,319
But they weren't exactly little Bergmans.

286
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:11,599
No, but still, they had some edge.
And that's something we'd want.

287
00:26:11,799 --> 00:26:15,919
We want something fun. Not another
boring local government video.

288
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:17,639
Most of them are like that.

289
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:21,039
But thinking outside the box,
that's a good thing.

290
00:26:21,239 --> 00:26:23,759
You've got free rein, it's just...

291
00:26:23,959 --> 00:26:28,599
We've got a local company...

292
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,959
Lafors Construction Company.

293
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:35,039
I mean, we really had no budget for this.

294
00:26:35,239 --> 00:26:39,079
- So they're sponsoring this film.
- That's great.

295
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:42,039
So, except for that,
you have free rein.

296
00:26:42,239 --> 00:26:45,119
- They may have some ideas...
- Absolutely.

297
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:47,799
- Cheers!
- Great.

298
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:53,559
- Let's take a swim.
- Let's.

299
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:56,159
Roughly, what, 18 degrees Celsius?

300
00:26:56,359 --> 00:26:58,919
Well, cheers again if we're going in.

301
00:27:00,879 --> 00:27:03,439
- Hey. Everything all right?
- Yeah, you?

302
00:27:03,639 --> 00:27:05,919
- It's all good.
- Great to hear.

303
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:14,879
Hello, ladies, gentleman.

304
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:18,479
Musse! Who is it that you're
walking around town with?

305
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:21,079
We're making an epic film
to showcase Lafors.

306
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:24,199
- Is that really necessary?
- Yeah...

307
00:27:25,639 --> 00:27:27,319
Hello...

308
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:34,519
Hi.

309
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:41,079
<i>Son, are you cold?</i>

310
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:43,359
<i>Are you cold right now?</i>

311
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:49,839
<i>I'm cold. Do you wear good clothes
to protect you from the cold?</i>

312
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:55,159
<i>My feet are very cold.</i>

313
00:27:55,359 --> 00:28:00,039
<i>But you're not wearing enough clothes.</i>

314
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:05,879
Great to see Musse visiting today.
Great to see that you're talking.

315
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:12,839
<i>Your hands are cold.
You have to wear some gloves.</i>

316
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:20,519
We've been having trouble lately,
understanding what it is that Anusha...

317
00:28:21,639 --> 00:28:23,719
She's speaking her old language.

318
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:27,479
<i>What to do?
We have to live like this.</i>

319
00:28:28,759 --> 00:28:32,039
- Can you translate?
- No.

320
00:28:32,239 --> 00:28:36,479
Not at all...? To help us
understand what she wants...

321
00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:40,879
No... it kind of never happened.

322
00:28:42,279 --> 00:28:46,719
Me and my sister
don't speak any Tamil at all.

323
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:51,439
There weren't that many people
in Lafors who spoke Tamil...

324
00:28:51,639 --> 00:28:55,119
so it never...
Morn didn't feel it was necessary.

325
00:29:00,759 --> 00:29:04,319
That's what happens sometimes,
when one gets old and sick.

326
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:08,199
One loses one's Swedish
and goes back to the old.

327
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:19,199
- It's not easy.
- No.

328
00:29:19,399 --> 00:29:22,039
But it's great to have Musse
visiting here today.

329
00:29:22,239 --> 00:29:23,679
Do you think so?

330
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:28,559
Yeah...

331
00:29:33,639 --> 00:29:35,879
<i>I have to find you a girl.</i>

332
00:29:50,959 --> 00:29:56,799
<i>A beautiful old dream
has followed us for years</i>

333
00:29:56,999 --> 00:30:02,159
<i>And never, ever shall we stop
believing it will one day be ours</i>

334
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:08,719
<i>Our happy dream, it will come true</i>

335
00:30:08,919 --> 00:30:12,999
Unemployment is so high these days.
It's a huge health issue.

336
00:30:13,199 --> 00:30:17,399
But isn't Lafors a little better off
than the rest of Sweden?

337
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:22,719
Not anymore, unfortunately.
Many things are closing down.

338
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:24,879
Things don't work the way they used to.

339
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:28,119
- What's that?
- What is this?

340
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:31,079
Film it! Oh, my God!
What is it?

341
00:30:58,879 --> 00:31:00,559
Go! Go!

342
00:32:10,759 --> 00:32:14,719
It gives me no pleasure to say this,

343
00:32:14,919 --> 00:32:19,159
but the council will make
its own film about Lafors.

344
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:23,319
- Oh?
- Oh.

345
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:28,759
Yes, because What you
and your classmates showed them,

346
00:32:28,959 --> 00:32:31,199
it just wasn't...

347
00:32:32,599 --> 00:32:35,799
It just wasn't good enough,
according to them.

348
00:32:35,999 --> 00:32:37,879
- Oh?
- No.

349
00:32:40,719 --> 00:32:43,679
So everything we filmed was bad?

350
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:46,999
No, I think you've become
really great at it.

351
00:32:47,199 --> 00:32:49,999
And What you've been filming,

352
00:32:50,199 --> 00:32:52,359
of your foster family cleaning,

353
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:55,919
there's a class perspective there
that's great.

354
00:32:56,079 --> 00:32:59,279
By the way, hey...

355
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:03,679
It reminds me of my husband
Roland's early films.

356
00:33:03,879 --> 00:33:07,959
Would you like him
to maybe visit the school?

357
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:10,599
He's a filmmaker.
He can tell you all about it.

358
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:12,679
Wouldn't that be something?

359
00:33:36,199 --> 00:33:40,399
Come on. Focus.
Do you want to get hit or what?

360
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:51,599
Come on. One, two.
Great! Come on!

361
00:34:05,839 --> 00:34:07,999
- Are you done soon?
- Soon.

362
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,919
Come in!

363
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:16,559
- Aida!

364
00:34:16,759 --> 00:34:19,279
Public Enemy Number 2.

365
00:34:19,479 --> 00:34:21,399
- Want some Ice cream?
- Yeah.

366
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:25,239
- Hi, Aida.
- Hey.

367
00:34:25,439 --> 00:34:27,239
- What's that?
- A present.

368
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,879
- For you?
- Girls...

369
00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:36,159
Yeah?

370
00:34:36,359 --> 00:34:39,999
Don't let it get you down.
Who cares what they say?

371
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:44,079
Now you can film whatever you want.

372
00:34:46,359 --> 00:34:48,599
- Make your film.
- Just keep filming.

373
00:34:48,799 --> 00:34:52,959
- Be a pain in the council's ass.
- Hell, yeah.

374
00:34:54,919 --> 00:34:58,319
Do you know what Mom did
before I met her?

375
00:34:58,519 --> 00:35:01,719
Can I tell her?
She was a journalist in Istanbul.

376
00:35:01,919 --> 00:35:05,359
- What? Is that true?
- A journalist in Istanbul.

377
00:35:05,559 --> 00:35:09,519
- A journalist in Istanbul.
- The sharpest pen in Istanbul.

378
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:12,079
The sharpest pen in Istanbul.

379
00:35:12,799 --> 00:35:14,919
Don't laugh...

380
00:35:15,159 --> 00:35:17,879
Many people were terrified
of her writings.

381
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:23,359
The politicians, the police,
sometimes even the neighbors.

382
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:29,919
It's important, what you're doing.

383
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:32,879
Show the real Lafors!

384
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:47,639
This is looking great.
It's going to be super.

385
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:50,639
<i>- What's he saying?
- No idea.</i>

386
00:35:50,799 --> 00:35:54,199
<i>- Watch the white parts.
- I am being careful.</i>

387
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:56,479
Hey!

388
00:35:58,359 --> 00:36:00,679
- Lisa!
- The man from Stockholm is shouting.

389
00:36:00,879 --> 00:36:03,119
- Can you hear me?
- What's that, Roland?

390
00:36:03,279 --> 00:36:06,399
You can stop painting now!

391
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:09,679
The light is perfect!

392
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:11,759
- OK...
- What's he saying?

393
00:36:11,959 --> 00:36:16,599
Finish painting those boards,
then we start shooting.

394
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:20,399
- Only the front will be visible.
- He can't leave it like this.

395
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:22,919
- Is that clear?
- Yes, I hear you.

396
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:25,679
- This will be great!
- Is he going to leave it like this?

397
00:36:25,879 --> 00:36:27,199
I think he wants to...

398
00:36:27,399 --> 00:36:30,879
Guys! He's filming.

399
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:34,799
The man with the camera.
Finish, and then...

400
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:36,959
<i>The guy with the camera
wants us to stop.</i>

401
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:39,039
Then we go.

402
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:43,199
<i>- You OK to take that yourself?
- Yeah, yeah.</i>

403
00:36:43,399 --> 00:36:45,559
<i>A bunch of idiots...</i>

404
00:36:46,399 --> 00:36:48,279
Hurry up if you can!

405
00:36:55,959 --> 00:36:58,559
<i>- What happens?
- No idea. They're all nuts.</i>

406
00:36:58,759 --> 00:37:00,439
<i>Do we paint or not?</i>

407
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:04,239
- Gosta!
- You'll have to hide back here.

408
00:37:04,439 --> 00:37:06,839
What's he thinking?
What's he doing?

409
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:09,959
That's a good question, Gosta.
We don't know.

410
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:13,559
How are you guys doing?
You don't understand.

411
00:37:13,759 --> 00:37:14,759
<i>Now what does he want?</i>

412
00:37:14,959 --> 00:37:19,599
<i>- Be cool.
- It's us they're laughing at.</i>

413
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:32,599
BUILDING A MODERN TANNERY

414
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:45,919
Ew, it smells bad in here.

415
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:56,919
Oh, my God, Aida!
It's, like, real animals!

416
00:38:06,279 --> 00:38:08,199
- Hello.
- Hi, hi.

417
00:38:08,399 --> 00:38:09,879
Hi!

418
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,799
Why do you live in Lafors?

419
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:17,199
It's a good place to live.
A small town.

420
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:20,399
It suits me.

421
00:38:25,719 --> 00:38:27,599
Do you work out?

422
00:38:28,879 --> 00:38:30,759
Flex! Flex! Flex!

423
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:42,879
- When did you move here?
- Not long ago.

424
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:45,679
I moved to Lafors about a year ago.

425
00:38:45,879 --> 00:38:49,679
Then you're just as brave as me.
I also moved here on my own.

426
00:38:49,879 --> 00:38:52,239
It was 1986.

427
00:39:09,559 --> 00:39:14,679
- Are you happy about Superbilly?
- Got mixed feelings.

428
00:39:14,879 --> 00:39:19,199
I don't know. I guess I'm worried
they'll drive us out of business.

429
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:20,639
Oh.

430
00:39:20,839 --> 00:39:25,599
They've got cheaper leather
from poorer countries.

431
00:39:25,799 --> 00:39:29,199
But everyone will be able to
afford Superbilly. That's good, right?

432
00:39:29,399 --> 00:39:32,319
Do you know how they make leather?

433
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:36,359
- No.
- It's really, really bad.

434
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:40,959
There is no union,
the conditions are appalling.

435
00:39:41,159 --> 00:39:44,759
- They splash around among of the hides.
- Oh.

436
00:39:44,959 --> 00:39:49,079
Plus, the pay is also very bad.

437
00:40:05,159 --> 00:40:07,519
No... Facing that way, yeah.

438
00:40:08,479 --> 00:40:10,199
That looks good.

439
00:40:10,399 --> 00:40:13,799
No, no. Hold it right there.
Ready on set.

440
00:40:15,999 --> 00:40:17,919
Action.

441
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,559
Oops.

442
00:40:35,319 --> 00:40:39,279
- Cut! Typical...
- I think he's going to fish.

443
00:40:43,759 --> 00:40:47,559
- What's that? He's going to fish?
- Yeah, people do that.

444
00:40:47,759 --> 00:40:50,759
I see him begging
outside the grocery store.

445
00:40:50,959 --> 00:40:54,679
- Talk about bad timing.
- He's going to fish.

446
00:40:54,879 --> 00:40:59,999
Can't you try...? Why don't you...?
Tell him we're filming.

447
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:03,159
- You want me to tell him to move?
Na.

448
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:07,279
- No way.
- We could wait, but it will take forever.

449
00:41:07,479 --> 00:41:10,119
Guys, how hard can it be?

450
00:41:10,359 --> 00:41:13,079
- I'll tell him in a friendly way.
- Kerstin, darling...

451
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:16,079
Thanks!

452
00:41:19,879 --> 00:41:21,439
How's it coming along?

453
00:41:21,639 --> 00:41:27,439
The hardest part about this
is getting the depth of field.

454
00:41:27,639 --> 00:41:28,959
What's the problem?

455
00:41:29,159 --> 00:41:30,879
- But It's a nice bridge.
- Yeah.

456
00:41:32,879 --> 00:41:35,319
Hello! Excuse me.

457
00:41:47,239 --> 00:41:49,439
It'll be fine.

458
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:52,959
The bags! Kerstin!

459
00:41:53,159 --> 00:41:56,239
Kerstin! Don't forget the fishing rod!

460
00:41:56,439 --> 00:41:58,439
Kerstin! Hey!

461
00:42:00,759 --> 00:42:05,039
- They're coming over.
- Over here? Why?

462
00:42:05,199 --> 00:42:06,799
Don't ask me.

463
00:42:11,079 --> 00:42:13,679
He doesn't speak Swedish or English,
so I figured...

464
00:42:13,879 --> 00:42:17,959
we let him see through the camera,
so he understands why he can't be there.

465
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:19,799
OK, sure.

466
00:42:19,999 --> 00:42:23,759
Please. Do you see the bridge?
It has to be empty.

467
00:42:23,959 --> 00:42:26,799
No people.
If you just could wait for...

468
00:42:26,999 --> 00:42:28,879
<i>- Speak Romanian?
- Yes, you too?</i>

469
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:31,039
<i>- Yes, me too.
- Thank God!</i>

470
00:42:31,239 --> 00:42:33,999
<i>You can't be on the bridge
because we're making a film.</i>

471
00:42:34,199 --> 00:42:36,039
<i>You have to move.</i>

472
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:38,359
<i>Does it have to be that bridge?</i>

473
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:41,359
- Just for a moment...
- He wants to know, why there?

474
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:45,119
Because we are doing
a film about this town.

475
00:42:45,319 --> 00:42:48,519
And the heritage.
The history of the town.

476
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:50,879
<i>- You have</i> to <i>move.</i>
- And this bridge is so old.

477
00:42:51,079 --> 00:42:53,039
<i>No, sir, I won't move.</i>

478
00:42:53,239 --> 00:42:54,559
<i>- Why not?
- Don't want to.</i>

479
00:42:54,759 --> 00:42:56,319
<i>Yes, you need to move.</i>

480
00:42:56,519 --> 00:42:58,799
<i>I don't want to.
I'm going to fish there.</i>

481
00:42:58,959 --> 00:43:03,839
<i>Fish, what fish? You have no right...
No, we're making a film here.</i>

482
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:06,319
<i>- I won't move.
- Why not? You should be ashamed!</i>

483
00:43:06,519 --> 00:43:08,919
<i>Me, ashamed?
You should be ashamed!</i>

484
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:14,279
<i>- I'm there fishing so I can eat.
- If you want to eat, get a job.</i>

485
00:43:14,479 --> 00:43:16,319
<i>- Get a job, where?
- Get a job!</i>

486
00:43:16,519 --> 00:43:19,079
<i>- Go to school and get a job.
- But how?</i>

487
00:43:19,279 --> 00:43:22,599
<i>My parents came here just like you
and they got jobs...</i>

488
00:43:22,839 --> 00:43:25,479
<i>I don't give a shit about your parents.
This is me here.</i>

489
00:43:25,719 --> 00:43:30,479
<i>What do you mean? We all have to work!
You can't be there and wait for handouts.</i>

490
00:43:30,679 --> 00:43:33,279
<i>- You can't!
- Yes, I can!</i>

491
00:43:33,479 --> 00:43:36,239
<i>- No, you can't! Don't you get it?
- Get out of here!</i>

492
00:43:36,439 --> 00:43:37,439
<i>Leave me alone!</i>

493
00:43:37,559 --> 00:43:38,799
Calm down.

494
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:45,479
Here, take 200 kronor. OK.
Take it easy now.

495
00:43:45,679 --> 00:43:48,519
<i>Go fuck yourselves!
Leave me alone!</i>

496
00:43:48,759 --> 00:43:51,159
What's he saying?

497
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:55,159
- Why are you saying that to me?
<i>- Leave</i> me <i>alone, woman!</i>

498
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:57,359
- I haven't done anything to you.
<i>- Suck</i> my <i>dick!</i>

499
00:43:57,519 --> 00:43:59,799
Kerstin, come here!
Never mind that!

500
00:43:59,999 --> 00:44:03,879
- I have been kind to you.
- Kerstin, come here!

501
00:44:04,119 --> 00:44:07,199
- Come here.
- That's just terrible!

502
00:44:07,399 --> 00:44:11,239
What's he saying?
I tried to be nice.

503
00:44:11,439 --> 00:44:14,639
It's just awful. I don't want to...

504
00:44:14,799 --> 00:44:16,759
And you don't...
What's happening?

505
00:44:16,959 --> 00:44:20,079
Hey, please...

506
00:44:20,279 --> 00:44:22,319
This isn't worth filming, is it?

507
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:25,759
Stop filming now.

508
00:44:25,959 --> 00:44:27,039
- Let's go.
- No.

509
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:30,119
Put that away.

510
00:44:30,239 --> 00:44:31,959
- Roland...
- Stop filming, I said!

511
00:44:32,159 --> 00:44:33,199
- Why?
- Cut it out.

512
00:44:33,399 --> 00:44:34,639
- No.

513
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:37,239
- Put that away.
- Cut it out!

514
00:44:37,439 --> 00:44:40,079
Stop filming, I said!
You don't fucking film me!

515
00:44:40,279 --> 00:44:41,839
- Calm down, girls.
- Put it away.

516
00:44:42,039 --> 00:44:44,599
Cocksucker, don't you film Lafors!

517
00:44:44,799 --> 00:44:47,759
- What are you saying?!
- Stockholm asshole!

518
00:44:47,959 --> 00:44:50,159
- Girls, that's a no-no...
- FUCK YOU!!!

519
00:44:50,359 --> 00:44:51,999
You don't say that! That's a no-no!

520
00:44:52,199 --> 00:44:55,199
- Don't touch me!
- You don't say that to other people!

521
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:19,799
Come on, girls.

522
00:45:34,759 --> 00:45:37,879
It's only a film, what does it...

523
00:45:44,919 --> 00:45:48,839
film... film... film...

524
00:45:49,039 --> 00:45:51,879
film... film...

525
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:55,599
film... film...
There are already tons of films.

526
00:45:55,799 --> 00:46:00,639
<i>Do something important instead
of getting driven home like a criminal.</i>

527
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:08,559
So goddamn embarrassing.

528
00:46:08,759 --> 00:46:10,039
"Embarrassing!"

529
00:46:10,239 --> 00:46:12,279
I'm ashamed of you!
You know?

530
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:13,799
<i>Stop it. Stop it, Ella.</i>

531
00:46:16,919 --> 00:46:18,399
I'll get it for you.

532
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:20,919
Did you have to film that?

533
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:24,319
- I want ketchup.
- I want food, too!

534
00:46:24,519 --> 00:46:27,159
OK, I'll get you.

535
00:46:28,039 --> 00:46:30,239
I'll get you your dinner.
Wait here.

536
00:46:32,639 --> 00:46:34,479
<i>I need another plate.</i>

537
00:46:34,679 --> 00:46:35,759
OK. I'll get you.

538
00:46:35,919 --> 00:46:37,719
- I have no plate.
- I'll get it.

539
00:46:37,919 --> 00:46:39,639
I want a plate, too.

540
00:46:41,679 --> 00:46:44,039
Are you getting any of this?

541
00:46:44,959 --> 00:46:49,119
After everything she's done for you.
And you just piss on it.

542
00:46:52,759 --> 00:46:55,159
What do Dana's parents say?

543
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:58,879
<i>What do they know? They haven't
struggled once in their lives.</i>

544
00:46:59,079 --> 00:47:01,679
<i>Neither that Kurdish woman
nor that Yugoslavian man.</i>

545
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:04,479
<i>They have their cafÃ© and brag about it.</i>

546
00:47:05,199 --> 00:47:07,559
<i>She doesn't even know how to bake.</i>

547
00:47:07,759 --> 00:47:10,879
<i>Don't get me in trouble
with your filming.</i>

548
00:47:12,519 --> 00:47:17,279
<i>Life is full of mysteries</i>

549
00:47:17,479 --> 00:47:22,879
<i>Things you cannot understand</i>

550
00:47:23,079 --> 00:47:26,799
<i>Doubts and questions grow stronger</i>

551
00:47:37,039 --> 00:47:40,399
And we'd love it if you could mention
Lafors Construction Company in the film.

552
00:47:40,599 --> 00:47:42,039
This place isn't exactly scenic.

553
00:47:42,239 --> 00:47:46,799
We feel it shows a kind of pioneering
spirit and a faith in the future.

554
00:47:46,999 --> 00:47:51,999
And we want to show that we're capable...

555
00:47:52,199 --> 00:47:55,359
of getting a company
like Superbilly to come here.

556
00:47:55,559 --> 00:47:57,399
Maybe that's what we need?

557
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:01,279
Someone from local government
to put loving words to the images

558
00:48:01,479 --> 00:48:04,879
and who can describe
the possibilities of this plot.

559
00:48:05,679 --> 00:48:06,759
What do you say?

560
00:48:06,999 --> 00:48:08,879
- Huh?
- Great idea.

561
00:48:09,719 --> 00:48:11,879
- You want me to do it?
- Yes! It'd be perfect.

562
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:13,519
Why?

563
00:48:13,719 --> 00:48:16,439
You've got great charisma.

564
00:48:17,279 --> 00:48:21,159
Wouldn't it be better if...
Can't you do it, Musse?

565
00:48:21,399 --> 00:48:23,119
- Me?
- You're charming, and cuteâ

566
00:48:23,319 --> 00:48:25,319
I had a speech therapist
all through middle school.

567
00:48:25,519 --> 00:48:28,399
- I can't talk on camera.
- But why should I?

568
00:48:29,279 --> 00:48:32,119
- I can't. I don't like cameras.
- You can do it!

569
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:33,879
I think he's ready now!

570
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:37,039
- Am I ready? Do I need that hat?
- You need to wear this.

571
00:48:37,239 --> 00:48:39,599
Shall I walk and do a bit
of David Attenborough?

572
00:48:39,759 --> 00:48:44,279
And Musse, think "serious but charming."
That's your specialty.

573
00:48:44,479 --> 00:48:46,999
- Serious but charming.
- Is that even a thing?

574
00:48:47,199 --> 00:48:49,279
- Oh, God...
- This will be great.

575
00:48:50,879 --> 00:48:53,719
- I'll look into the camera.
- We're rolling!

576
00:48:55,879 --> 00:49:00,959
Welcome to a growth area
in the middle of Vastergotland.

577
00:49:01,159 --> 00:49:05,519
10,000 cars come through here daily,
a million square meters await you

578
00:49:05,679 --> 00:49:09,439
and your business, so you
can find your home in Lafors.

579
00:49:10,679 --> 00:49:12,239
- Great!
- That was great!

580
00:49:12,439 --> 00:49:16,439
- I feel like you're biased.
- No, I think you were great.

581
00:49:16,639 --> 00:49:19,839
- I couldn't have done It without you.
- And that hat.

582
00:49:21,039 --> 00:49:23,159
Ask the experts.

583
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:25,519
Can't you do it instead, Lisa?

584
00:49:25,719 --> 00:49:29,239
I don't want to.
And he was great.

585
00:49:29,439 --> 00:49:33,359
- You were too cute. That was the problem.
- Too cute...

586
00:49:33,519 --> 00:49:36,599
What's the problem?

587
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:46,279
Musse, I don't mean to be rude,
but if you're representing us,

588
00:49:46,479 --> 00:49:50,079
people will start to wonder
why you're in this film.

589
00:49:50,279 --> 00:49:52,159
- And than of other things.
- I get It.

590
00:49:52,359 --> 00:49:55,519
We want to promote
Swedish building traditions.

591
00:49:55,719 --> 00:49:58,399
I don't look like the typical
Lafors representative.

592
00:49:58,599 --> 00:50:02,439
- But you are a Lafors representative.
- Yeah, but...

593
00:50:02,639 --> 00:50:06,119
But it could get in the way of...
People might get other ideas.

594
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:10,039
It could get in the way of
our message. I totally get it.

595
00:50:37,239 --> 00:50:40,599
- Microwave meal again?
- You bet.

596
00:50:54,479 --> 00:50:56,999
<i>Help would rarely get there.</i>

597
00:50:58,279 --> 00:51:04,679
<i>Children who don't get help will die
from diseases or undernourishment.</i>

598
00:51:12,679 --> 00:51:17,079
Right, then, now you've seen
one of my documentaries.

599
00:51:17,279 --> 00:51:19,639
A difficult watch, yes.
Heavy, yes.

600
00:51:20,919 --> 00:51:23,639
But also important and urgent.

601
00:51:25,159 --> 00:51:27,199
Or what do you think?

602
00:51:28,879 --> 00:51:34,639
Kerstin and I went down there
to give people a voice.

603
00:51:34,839 --> 00:51:41,039
But as a filmmaker, you always need
a moral compass. You know what that is?

604
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:44,039
You can't violate people.

605
00:51:44,239 --> 00:51:49,399
You can't just barge in, you have to stop
and think, am I going too far?

606
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:51,319
Or have I done too much?

607
00:51:51,519 --> 00:51:52,799
Yes?

608
00:51:52,999 --> 00:51:56,999
There was a guy in Class 98
who filmed us in the shower yesterday.

609
00:51:57,199 --> 00:52:00,359
- What?
- Does he have the right to post that?

610
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:03,919
- That was a joke.
- Not really...

611
00:52:04,119 --> 00:52:09,079
I'll tell you, that's totally immoral.

612
00:52:09,279 --> 00:52:14,319
Absolutely not OK. It's a violation,
filming someone naked in the shower.

613
00:52:14,519 --> 00:52:15,519
Really...

614
00:52:15,639 --> 00:52:19,319
But didn't you film all those
half-starved dying people?

615
00:52:19,519 --> 00:52:23,559
- Yes.
- You filmed them and they were naked.

616
00:52:24,879 --> 00:52:27,119
Good, yes, well spotted.

617
00:52:27,279 --> 00:52:32,559
And I think there's a moral compass issue
there. Should I film them naked or not?

618
00:52:32,759 --> 00:52:36,359
If he feels violated, why wouldn't they?

619
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:39,679
Yes, but they don't live here
in Western Europe.

620
00:52:39,879 --> 00:52:44,879
They'll never see these films,
nor will anyone they know.

621
00:52:45,079 --> 00:52:48,399
Ever heard of YouTube?
If some Japanese came here

622
00:52:48,599 --> 00:52:52,959
and filmed you naked
or while doing something private...?

623
00:52:53,159 --> 00:52:54,799
Yes, you're right...

624
00:52:54,999 --> 00:52:58,199
- That's a violation, right?
- Yes, but...

625
00:52:58,399 --> 00:53:01,239
If they had filmed me without asking.

626
00:53:01,439 --> 00:53:03,399
Did you ask those people?

627
00:53:03,639 --> 00:53:07,879
Does anyone else who saw the film
want to say something?

628
00:53:08,639 --> 00:53:09,999
I thought it was pretty good.

629
00:53:10,199 --> 00:53:13,199
- Good to hear. It moved you?
- Umm, yeah...

630
00:53:13,399 --> 00:53:16,399
Great. So you see,
there are different views...

631
00:53:16,599 --> 00:53:18,159
Different opinions.

632
00:53:18,359 --> 00:53:22,399
Hey, guys. This is the first step
in a debate about precisely this:

633
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:27,599
How do we see the world?
What influences our worldview? Remember?

634
00:53:27,799 --> 00:53:29,799
Exactly. Like the council film.

635
00:53:29,999 --> 00:53:34,679
Why show only bad stuff from down there
but make Sweden and Lafors look great?

636
00:53:34,879 --> 00:53:36,799
They're two different films.
One is a commercial.

637
00:53:36,919 --> 00:53:41,199
We want to show the best of the town.
The other one is a documentary.

638
00:53:41,399 --> 00:53:44,119
The film we just saw is about my country.
It's about his country.

639
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:46,119
- He's from there too.
- Sit down, Aida.

640
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:48,879
Why only show bad stuff?

641
00:53:49,719 --> 00:53:50,719
Yes, you're right...

642
00:53:50,919 --> 00:53:56,399
You don't think about who sees it.
It's all of us...

643
00:53:56,559 --> 00:54:01,999
Aida, why can't we talk about this
in a normal tone of voice? It's unpleasant.

644
00:54:02,199 --> 00:54:07,919
We've invited a person
and you're basically yelling at him.

645
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:12,799
- Actually, yeah.
- Why are you so angry?

646
00:54:35,239 --> 00:54:37,359
What do you think of Superbilly
coming here?

647
00:54:37,559 --> 00:54:41,279
- Good, I guess.
- Is it good? Why?

648
00:54:41,479 --> 00:54:43,439
I save more money.

649
00:54:43,639 --> 00:54:49,359
We can't control what other countries...
I don't know what to say to that.

650
00:54:49,559 --> 00:54:53,279
I guess it's sad,
but I don't know what to say to that.

651
00:54:53,479 --> 00:54:57,079
Take me, I'm from South America,
from Colombia...

652
00:54:57,279 --> 00:54:59,759
There's a lot of child labor there.

653
00:54:59,959 --> 00:55:01,999
- Really?
- Yeah.

654
00:55:02,199 --> 00:55:04,639
- Did you work as a child?
- No, not me.

655
00:55:04,839 --> 00:55:07,119
I came to Sweden many years ago.

656
00:55:07,319 --> 00:55:09,919
Why did you come here?

657
00:55:10,119 --> 00:55:14,799
I was adopted,
so I was selected to come here.

658
00:55:14,999 --> 00:55:17,999
They have to work hard
in bad conditions.

659
00:55:18,159 --> 00:55:20,719
Hey, could you move a little?

660
00:55:20,919 --> 00:55:22,239
Yeah...

661
00:55:22,439 --> 00:55:24,719
- Excuse me.
- I mean, it's cheap...

662
00:55:24,879 --> 00:55:28,999
- Did you know she's filming you?
- I'm filming her.

663
00:55:29,199 --> 00:55:31,799
- That's the lens.
- I'm not filming him.

664
00:55:31,999 --> 00:55:34,159
- Are you OK with that?
- No, actually.

665
00:55:34,359 --> 00:55:36,759
- Why don't you bag your stuff?
- We're here to shop.

666
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:41,319
- Think about what you're buying.
- That's on our conscience.

667
00:55:41,519 --> 00:55:46,039
Do you have to attack the little man?
I'm the little man.

668
00:55:46,239 --> 00:55:48,439
The little man?

669
00:55:55,399 --> 00:56:00,079
Where do you want me to shop?
Some place I can't afford?

670
00:56:00,279 --> 00:56:03,519
It's my paycheck which I use
to provide for my family.

671
00:56:03,719 --> 00:56:09,559
I've got this much left after
all the bills and the car payments.

672
00:56:09,759 --> 00:56:12,239
You don't pay those for me, do you?

673
00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:15,719
That'll be 504 kronor, please.

674
00:56:15,919 --> 00:56:18,759
Could you move it
so I can go on?

675
00:56:20,199 --> 00:56:22,719
Leave him alone now.
Leave him alone.

676
00:56:22,919 --> 00:56:25,599
We're not even talking to him!
We're just standing here.

677
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:31,919
You're filming, girls.
We're just here to do our shopping.

678
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:35,599
- People are suffering.
- Take it up with the corporations.

679
00:56:35,799 --> 00:56:38,239
Why don't you take it up with them?

680
00:56:38,439 --> 00:56:41,439
If you had given this some thought,
and cared a little.

681
00:56:41,639 --> 00:56:44,719
I care about my family.
That's what it all comes down to.

682
00:56:44,919 --> 00:56:47,039
At someone else's expense.

683
00:56:47,239 --> 00:56:49,119
Can you move the cart?

684
00:56:49,319 --> 00:56:53,559
That's rich coming from you. I'd imagine
your parents live on some benefits.

685
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:57,639
So you should shut up!

686
00:57:03,719 --> 00:57:05,119
Film this.

687
00:57:05,319 --> 00:57:07,639
What? Aida!

688
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:09,719
What are you doing?

689
00:57:10,759 --> 00:57:12,959
- Hey!
- Aida!

690
00:57:15,399 --> 00:57:17,519
But... what the hell!?

691
00:57:20,119 --> 00:57:21,239
Damn!

692
00:57:21,439 --> 00:57:22,559
Aida!

693
00:57:23,239 --> 00:57:26,279
- Aida, come on!
- Go, go, go!

694
00:57:29,879 --> 00:57:31,119
You're insane!

695
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:04,839
That's great!

696
00:58:05,079 --> 00:58:07,319
Oh, no. Did it hurt?

697
00:58:07,519 --> 00:58:08,639
Come on!

698
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:11,559
Hit me. Hit me.

699
00:58:11,799 --> 00:58:13,039
Hit. Hit...

700
00:58:17,719 --> 00:58:18,719
Focus!

701
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:49,399
Good.

702
00:58:50,919 --> 00:58:53,199
Not the eyes!
Just on the mouth.

703
00:58:54,599 --> 00:58:55,919
<i>What's that?</i>

704
00:58:56,999 --> 00:58:57,999
<i>Let me see.</i>

705
00:58:58,199 --> 00:59:00,439
What have you done?

706
00:59:00,639 --> 00:59:02,359
<i>- What have you done, âour?
What?</i>

707
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:03,879
Are you crazy.

708
00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:06,199
- What have you done to her?
- What?

709
00:59:06,399 --> 00:59:08,479
What's that?
I didn't do that.

710
00:59:08,679 --> 00:59:10,559
What happened?

711
00:59:16,599 --> 00:59:18,479
Come in!

712
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:21,479
Hello.

713
00:59:21,679 --> 00:59:24,719
- Welcome.
- Hi. How are you?

714
00:59:24,879 --> 00:59:27,199
- Fine, thanks.
- You're welcome.

715
00:59:27,399 --> 00:59:30,199
- Hey! Number 2...
- Hi!

716
00:59:31,039 --> 00:59:34,799
- This is for you.
- You shouldn't have. Thank you.

717
00:59:34,999 --> 00:59:36,959
- Shall I take your coat?
- Thank you.

718
00:59:49,399 --> 00:59:51,799
Well, this is us...

719
00:59:55,039 --> 00:59:56,399
- Ooh...!
- Wow...!

720
00:59:56,599 --> 00:59:59,559
- This is genuine kebab.
- Is it kebab?

721
00:59:59,759 --> 01:00:02,919
This is called sambousek.

722
01:00:03,159 --> 01:00:04,479
Yum.

723
01:00:04,679 --> 01:00:07,919
Would you like to try the dolma?

724
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:12,879
Is it dolma? We have this in my country
as well - same thing.

725
01:00:15,519 --> 01:00:18,319
- There you go.
- Thank you.

726
01:00:18,999 --> 01:00:22,159
Did you make the baklava
or is it store-bought?

727
01:00:22,359 --> 01:00:27,399
- I usually make it in the cafÃ© myself.
- Me, too. I make it at home.

728
01:00:37,719 --> 01:00:40,799
Thank you for having me.

729
01:00:40,999 --> 01:00:43,319
I wanted to talk to you.

730
01:00:44,319 --> 01:00:49,639
I'm worried about our girls.

731
01:00:51,959 --> 01:00:55,519
What kind of trouble
have you been getting into?

732
01:00:55,719 --> 01:00:57,759
We have just been filming.

733
01:00:59,439 --> 01:01:01,559
They're causing trouble with their film.

734
01:01:01,759 --> 01:01:05,399
I'm worried I'll get fired from my job.

735
01:01:06,199 --> 01:01:09,919
I'm really happy there,
and they're happy with me.

736
01:01:10,119 --> 01:01:12,479
But they're not doing anything wrong.

737
01:01:15,999 --> 01:01:19,399
I think they are so talented, and smart.

738
01:01:20,919 --> 01:01:25,479
If you want something in life,
you have to be brave.

739
01:01:25,719 --> 01:01:28,159
Go against what people tell you.

740
01:01:28,359 --> 01:01:30,199
Make sacrifices.

741
01:01:30,399 --> 01:01:32,279
<i>What is she saying?</i>

742
01:01:32,479 --> 01:01:37,199
<i>If you want to make something of yourself
in life, you need to be brave.</i>

743
01:01:37,359 --> 01:01:42,239
<i>You need 90 against what people say
and make sacrifices.</i>

744
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:54,359
Listen to me, I beg you.

745
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:58,959
We can't afford to make sacrifices.

746
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:07,079
<i>They don't know how we live.
They don't even know us.</i>

747
01:02:07,279 --> 01:02:09,719
- What <i>is she</i> saying?
<i>- Translate! Tell her!</i>

748
01:02:11,679 --> 01:02:18,079
I understand that you get worried.
But you have to understand me, too.

749
01:02:18,279 --> 01:02:22,719
I've sacrificed a lot for my daughter
to become whatever she wants.

750
01:02:22,919 --> 01:02:24,719
For her to take space.

751
01:02:24,919 --> 01:02:30,159
I want her to sing, play the drums, go out
in the streets, shout whatever she wants.

752
01:02:30,359 --> 01:02:33,119
<i>Have some compassion!
We are working people.</i>

753
01:02:33,319 --> 01:02:36,519
<i>We can't eat or drink unless we work.</i>

754
01:02:36,759 --> 01:02:39,119
<i>See how we live!
What could happen to her?</i>

755
01:02:39,319 --> 01:02:43,999
<i>She will eat, drink,
she's got a home, the cafÃ©, a car...</i>

756
01:02:44,199 --> 01:02:48,639
<i>What do we have?
We can't even dress warm unless we work.</i>

757
01:02:51,079 --> 01:02:55,959
<i>Explain to her!
Explain to her what I'm saying!</i>

758
01:03:40,999 --> 01:03:43,279
Yes. That's a wrap!

759
01:03:43,479 --> 01:03:46,839
- Ready?
- Yes. We are ready.

760
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:04,759
<i>Why won't you eat?</i>

761
01:04:07,599 --> 01:04:10,439
<i>Conversation in Tamil lesson one.</i>

762
01:04:10,639 --> 01:04:14,079
<i>In this lesson we learn
how to quickly speak Tamil.</i>

763
01:04:14,279 --> 01:04:17,239
<i>We'll just look at
some general rules in Tamil,</i>

764
01:04:17,439 --> 01:04:22,119
<i>greetings, how to address family members,
and some simple words.</i>

765
01:04:22,359 --> 01:04:26,239
<i>We'll just use English to represent Tamil</i>

766
01:04:26,439 --> 01:04:30,799
<i>so you don't have to know how to write
or read Tamil to follow...</i>

767
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:05,359
Come on!
Bottom's up, old chap.

768
01:05:07,879 --> 01:05:12,279
I'm not telling you this
just because I love you. No...

769
01:05:12,479 --> 01:05:16,559
I'm not telling you this
just because I'm drunk, but...

770
01:05:16,759 --> 01:05:20,879
I love you.
From here to...

771
01:05:21,959 --> 01:05:24,039
From here...

772
01:05:24,239 --> 01:05:25,799
You know what?

773
01:05:25,999 --> 01:05:28,039
From here to Boras!

774
01:05:28,239 --> 01:05:30,119
To Borgs!

775
01:05:36,159 --> 01:05:39,799
Hey, can't we just...

776
01:05:39,999 --> 01:05:42,719
go canoeing.

777
01:05:51,039 --> 01:05:52,719
Can't we do something else?

778
01:05:56,879 --> 01:05:59,759
I'm here for you.

779
01:05:59,959 --> 01:06:02,679
I do it for you!

780
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:06,119
I do it... I do it for you.

781
01:06:08,359 --> 01:06:10,239
I'm not going to quit.

782
01:06:11,399 --> 01:06:14,839
Can't we do something else now?

783
01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:17,679
Other than filming?

784
01:06:20,639 --> 01:06:22,959
It's no fun anymore.

785
01:07:21,879 --> 01:07:23,439
I want to go fishing.

786
01:07:23,639 --> 01:07:26,639
I want to go to camp, I want to...

787
01:07:26,799 --> 01:07:31,639
do stuff with you, I don't
just want to run around and...

788
01:07:31,839 --> 01:07:34,319
film all the time.

789
01:07:35,079 --> 01:07:37,279
Hey.

790
01:07:37,479 --> 01:07:40,079
Look at me!

791
01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:13,399
I'm with you all the way.
But!!-

792
01:08:17,559 --> 01:08:22,679
Can't you just explain so I can understand
why it's so important to you?

793
01:08:28,999 --> 01:08:31,119
It's only a film.

794
01:08:40,239 --> 01:08:42,199
Beers, coming up!

795
01:08:42,399 --> 01:08:46,439
One round. My treat.

796
01:08:46,639 --> 01:08:51,199
I'm really excited about this.

797
01:08:51,399 --> 01:08:55,519
We've got a pro here,
so I reckon our film will be really good.

798
01:08:55,719 --> 01:08:59,199
Â«use, you've done a heck of a job.
- All of us.

799
01:08:59,399 --> 01:09:02,919
I think they deserve a toast
at this point.

800
01:09:03,119 --> 01:09:05,759
- We all deserve it.
- Cheers!

801
01:09:05,959 --> 01:09:09,559
- Lafors is in your hands, Musse.
- No pressure.

802
01:09:11,719 --> 01:09:13,679
Whose turn is it?

803
01:09:19,479 --> 01:09:21,559
Thank you.

804
01:09:23,199 --> 01:09:26,639
- Thank you for entrusting me with this.
- It's been fun.

805
01:09:32,679 --> 01:09:36,399
Cheers.
It's been one heck of a journey.

806
01:09:38,239 --> 01:09:40,519
- You've struggled.
- Yeah...

807
01:09:42,039 --> 01:09:44,079
It's always hard.

808
01:10:07,719 --> 01:10:09,079
Lennart!

809
01:10:10,079 --> 01:10:11,079
Hey, Mussel

810
01:10:11,279 --> 01:10:14,719
- Here you go.
- Cheers!

811
01:10:14,919 --> 01:10:19,319
Beautiful lady!
You too, guys!

812
01:10:19,519 --> 01:10:22,239
Let's do this.
Down it...

813
01:10:23,799 --> 01:10:25,199
Into the fog.

814
01:10:36,079 --> 01:10:37,959
Lisa!

815
01:10:40,239 --> 01:10:45,559
The world's nicest and greatest...
co-worker. You're so great.

816
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:47,719
- Roland!
- You're great.

817
01:10:49,399 --> 01:10:52,359
Roland! Stop being such a downer!

818
01:10:52,559 --> 01:10:55,039
You're fucking up the good vibe, Roland.

819
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:06,079
- What the hell?!
- Check me out!

820
01:11:06,279 --> 01:11:08,159
Strike!

821
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:34,599
- It's cool, I'm right-handed.
- Come here!

822
01:11:45,799 --> 01:11:47,799
- Eight more!
- Eight more.

823
01:11:47,999 --> 01:11:49,919
- How many do we want?
- Eight more ones!

824
01:11:50,119 --> 01:11:53,559
- When do we want them?
- Now! Eight more! Come on!

825
01:11:53,759 --> 01:11:55,559
Eight more!

826
01:11:55,759 --> 01:11:59,599
8 HOURS LEFT

827
01:12:33,239 --> 01:12:35,879
Hey, girls.
Is that you?

828
01:12:37,319 --> 01:12:40,719
I'm just a little... tired.

829
01:12:43,799 --> 01:12:45,839
I'm gonna have a little rest.

830
01:13:01,039 --> 01:13:03,479
What are you doing?

831
01:13:05,599 --> 01:13:07,999
Musse from the town council...

832
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:12,839
- He's so lame.
- You're lame!

833
01:13:15,519 --> 01:13:17,839
Forget you ever saw this.

834
01:13:25,839 --> 01:13:27,599
Stop filming.

835
01:13:29,159 --> 01:13:30,799
Just stop it.

836
01:13:30,999 --> 01:13:33,759
Girls... Don't stop filming.

837
01:13:33,959 --> 01:13:37,959
I think you should stop!
Just stop it.

838
01:13:38,199 --> 01:13:40,199
The Germans are coming.

839
01:13:40,399 --> 01:13:41,919
That's enough.

840
01:13:42,119 --> 01:13:43,839
Come to the cinema.

841
01:13:46,559 --> 01:13:48,439
Do your thing.

842
01:13:48,639 --> 01:13:50,439
- Lee me the camera.
- No.

843
01:13:50,679 --> 01:13:52,639
Just give it here.

844
01:13:54,799 --> 01:13:56,559
Do your thing.

845
01:13:59,079 --> 01:14:00,639
Give it...

846
01:14:04,719 --> 01:14:06,519
Just give me the fucking camera!

847
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:07,999
Fucking...

848
01:14:09,119 --> 01:14:10,679
Fucking cunt!

849
01:15:11,479 --> 01:15:13,639
They are here now.

850
01:15:13,839 --> 01:15:15,119
Good luck!

851
01:15:18,879 --> 01:15:20,599
I'll check on the coffee.

852
01:15:39,759 --> 01:15:41,079
Hello.

853
01:15:43,999 --> 01:15:46,919
Hello. Nice to meet you.

854
01:15:47,119 --> 01:15:49,159
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Elif.

855
01:15:52,519 --> 01:15:54,839
- You have perfect food.
- Great.

856
01:15:55,039 --> 01:15:58,119
- Typical Swedish food.
- You don't find this quality elsewhere.

857
01:15:58,359 --> 01:15:59,959
Do you have something
similar in Germany?

858
01:16:00,159 --> 01:16:04,399
Yes, <i>we</i> have <i>Fleischklopse.
Buletten, as</i> it's called.

859
01:16:04,599 --> 01:16:06,559
Of course, quite common also.

860
01:16:06,759 --> 01:16:08,919
- Was <i>it</i> called <i>Buletten?
- Buletten.</i>

861
01:16:09,119 --> 01:16:11,559
- Do you like what you have seen so far?
- Yes.

862
01:16:11,799 --> 01:16:14,639
But I would like to see
a little more, if possible.

863
01:16:14,839 --> 01:16:19,039
OK. Can I have your attention, please?

864
01:16:19,239 --> 01:16:21,559
We have a rather tight schedule today.

865
01:16:21,759 --> 01:16:26,599
First of all, we're going to enjoy a piece
of cake baked here in the local bakery.

866
01:16:26,799 --> 01:16:29,479
The oldest bakery in the region.

867
01:16:29,679 --> 01:16:31,839
Then we'll have a VIP screening for you

868
01:16:32,039 --> 01:16:38,759
where we'll show you a film of the Lafors
community in our old town cinema.

869
01:16:40,039 --> 01:16:42,839
Quite a piece of work.
Nice film, very nice film.

870
01:16:43,039 --> 01:16:46,519
And after that,
Peter from Lafors Construction Company

871
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:51,679
will take you to the construction site
for a little trip before you go back home.

872
01:16:51,879 --> 01:16:55,439
Maybe it's time for the video conference?

873
01:16:55,639 --> 01:16:57,439
Should we try to get this...?

874
01:16:57,639 --> 01:17:00,639
Could you keep it down?
We're going to have a conference here.

875
01:17:06,599 --> 01:17:09,519
Will it work?
Always exciting.

876
01:17:09,719 --> 01:17:11,599
<i>- Look!
- Hello?</i>

877
01:17:11,799 --> 01:17:14,359
- Hello, Frau Hohn!
<i>- Hello!</i>

878
01:17:15,919 --> 01:17:20,999
<i>We've just decided at HQ not to make
any further investments in Sweden.</i>

879
01:17:21,199 --> 01:17:24,919
<i>- Oh..
- What?</i>

880
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:29,399
<i>Perhaps I should speak directly
to the Swedish parties?</i>

881
01:17:29,599 --> 01:17:33,879
- She wants to talk to you directly.
- Nice. Yeah. We are here for you!

882
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:37,719
<i>Actually, I have no good news for you.
I'm sorry for that.</i>

883
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:42,439
<i>We just had an urgent meeting
with our head office here.</i>

884
01:17:42,639 --> 01:17:47,759
<i>And all our investments in Scandinavia
have to be postponed indefinitely.</i>

885
01:17:48,679 --> 01:17:53,519
<i>So the decision from the head office
is that our investments will be shifted</i>

886
01:17:53,679 --> 01:17:59,879
<i>to Eastern Europe, which is financially
a more advantageous situation for us.</i>

887
01:18:00,079 --> 01:18:02,559
<i>I'm really sorry that
I have to give you this...</i>

888
01:18:02,759 --> 01:18:06,239
Just short, so I understand
what you're saying.

889
01:18:06,439 --> 01:18:09,399
Do you mean that the project ends here?

890
01:18:09,599 --> 01:18:13,959
<i>That is unfortunately what I have
to tell you. The project ends here.</i>

891
01:18:14,159 --> 01:18:19,439
You're not going to invest anything
in Lafors community? Is that understood?

892
01:18:19,639 --> 01:18:21,559
<i>This is unfortunately not possible.</i>

893
01:18:21,759 --> 01:18:24,959
So very disappointing.
So very disappointing.

894
01:18:27,959 --> 01:18:29,519
Oh, no.

895
01:18:29,719 --> 01:18:33,919
<i>Frau Hahn, It's an unpleasant situation,
but we'll...</i>

896
01:18:34,119 --> 01:18:38,279
Could you continue in English,
so I can understand?

897
01:18:42,519 --> 01:18:44,319
Elif, say something.

898
01:18:44,519 --> 01:18:47,159
Please accept our apologies for this.

899
01:18:47,359 --> 01:18:48,759
We did not anticipate it.

900
01:18:48,959 --> 01:18:50,879
To apologize Is not enough.
Sorry.

901
01:18:52,599 --> 01:18:57,359
I don't want to see that fucking cake.
Let the Germans take it with them.

902
01:18:57,559 --> 01:19:00,479
What about the film?

903
01:19:00,679 --> 01:19:04,479
Yeah... I guess we'll have
to enjoy that on our own.

904
01:19:05,879 --> 01:19:08,439
Here we go...

905
01:19:08,639 --> 01:19:10,719
Are you ready for this?

906
01:19:14,319 --> 01:19:16,519
You're so awesome!
Oh, shit!

907
01:19:18,039 --> 01:19:19,359
Oh my God!

908
01:19:20,639 --> 01:19:21,959
Come in now!

909
01:19:25,199 --> 01:19:26,799
That's what I'm talking about!

910
01:19:26,999 --> 01:19:31,439
That's good. Thanks so much!
Give me a high five.

911
01:19:34,719 --> 01:19:36,919
Yes!

912
01:19:37,119 --> 01:19:40,159
Lafors! Lafors! Lafors! Lafors!

913
01:19:47,799 --> 01:19:49,759
That's what I'm talking about!

914
01:20:01,959 --> 01:20:03,279
Check it out!

915
01:20:04,279 --> 01:20:06,719
Come on! Yes!

916
01:20:08,279 --> 01:20:10,599
What is this?
Did you get all these people to come?

917
01:20:10,839 --> 01:20:12,039
Hi, Kerstin!

918
01:20:17,999 --> 01:20:18,999
Hello!

919
01:20:19,799 --> 01:20:21,479
Let's go, let's go!

920
01:20:24,279 --> 01:20:26,759
- High five, high five.
- High five.

921
01:20:28,199 --> 01:20:30,319
You as well!

922
01:20:30,519 --> 01:20:32,999
- Aida!
- You came!

923
01:20:33,199 --> 01:20:35,759
Hi! You look so nice!

924
01:20:38,559 --> 01:20:40,599
Thank you for coming!

925
01:20:51,239 --> 01:20:53,479
- Hello! Hey, Musse.
- Hi.

926
01:20:53,679 --> 01:20:55,639
- I've been trying to...
- What is this?

927
01:20:55,839 --> 01:20:58,879
I've tried to get these people out,
but it's impossible.

928
01:20:59,079 --> 01:21:05,719
- They're screening some other film, too.
- So many people!

929
01:21:05,919 --> 01:21:10,479
Wow, a lot of people here
to see our local government film.

930
01:21:10,679 --> 01:21:13,079
Where have they all come from?

931
01:21:18,159 --> 01:21:21,359
Right. Hello...

932
01:21:21,559 --> 01:21:24,799
A little...
Can you hear me now? Hello?

933
01:21:28,359 --> 01:21:30,799
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah!

934
01:21:31,759 --> 01:21:37,759
I'm pleased to see so many people here...

935
01:21:37,959 --> 01:21:42,959
for what was supposed to be
a closed screening of our film.

936
01:21:46,359 --> 01:21:52,119
Right, so the film is sponsored
by Lafors Construction Company...

937
01:21:52,319 --> 01:21:54,519
Their representative Peter is here.

938
01:21:56,279 --> 01:22:02,079
And now that you're all here,
I guess we just watch it together.

939
01:22:02,279 --> 01:22:06,279
So, a five-minute feast for the eyes...

940
01:22:06,479 --> 01:22:09,079
from our beloved home district.

941
01:22:09,279 --> 01:22:11,519
- Are you ready?
- Yes!

942
01:22:12,319 --> 01:22:13,879
Let's start the film.

943
01:22:14,079 --> 01:22:15,879
Let it reâ.

944
01:22:30,479 --> 01:22:32,879
<i>Lafors - the little Swedish town</i>

945
01:22:33,079 --> 01:22:36,719
<i>with great possibilities
and development potential.</i>

946
01:22:37,919 --> 01:22:40,119
<i>Here, there is boundless freedom.</i>

947
01:22:41,079 --> 01:22:44,399
<i>We welcome you here to discover
a countryside that's full of life.</i>

948
01:22:45,759 --> 01:22:50,519
<i>We are more than just a long tradition
of tanneries and textile factories.</i>

949
01:22:51,839 --> 01:22:55,999
<i>The people are friendly
and will give you a warm welcome.</i>

950
01:22:59,599 --> 01:23:02,639
<i>Lafors offers many
recreational activity options.</i>

951
01:23:02,839 --> 01:23:07,839
<i>You can fish in the Lafors rapids
and enjoy the pure Scandinavian nature.</i>

952
01:23:08,039 --> 01:23:12,719
<i>Or simply enjoy
a traditional Swedish âfika.</i> â

953
01:23:12,919 --> 01:23:18,199
<i>We offer attractive land prices for both
your firm and your red little cottage.</i>

954
01:23:19,039 --> 01:23:22,159
<i>We value Swedish building traditions.</i>

955
01:23:22,359 --> 01:23:26,279
<i>A million square meters
await you and your business.</i>

956
01:23:28,079 --> 01:23:33,039
<i>Dear parents, give your children
a real Astrid Lindgren childhood.</i>

957
01:23:33,999 --> 01:23:36,639
<i>With a focus on safety
and quality of life.</i>

958
01:23:42,599 --> 01:23:47,359
We thank the council for their film.

959
01:23:47,559 --> 01:23:49,999
It sure was... original.

960
01:23:50,199 --> 01:23:51,799
We all know why everyone is here.

961
01:23:51,999 --> 01:23:56,719
It's to see the film that you,
Aida and I have made.

962
01:23:56,919 --> 01:24:02,479
We want to thank Musse
at the town council for inspiring us.

963
01:24:42,639 --> 01:24:43,919
<i>Just be careful.</i>

964
01:24:44,119 --> 01:24:47,719
<i>This is the great book on Lafors.</i>

965
01:24:47,919 --> 01:24:49,559
<i>Here are some images from the past.</i>

966
01:24:49,759 --> 01:24:54,079
<i>- Is that Albania?
- No, it's Lafors.</i>

967
01:24:54,279 --> 01:24:57,359
This is Lafors...
about a hundred years ago.

968
01:24:57,559 --> 01:25:01,679
<i>- These are flax hackles.
- Which were invented in Lafors.</i>

969
01:25:01,839 --> 01:25:05,119
<i>- Exactly..
- Um, not really. They're everywhere.</i>

970
01:25:05,319 --> 01:25:09,039
<i>- But we were the first ones.
- No, not really...</i>

971
01:25:09,239 --> 01:25:11,319
<i>They've been around
since the middle ages.</i>

972
01:25:13,959 --> 01:25:17,079
<i>This is a real camera.
This is no phone.</i>

973
01:25:17,279 --> 01:25:19,719
<i>- What do you mean, real camera?
- Can't call anyone.</i>

974
01:25:19,959 --> 01:25:24,359
<i>- How much does it cost?
- A lot. Film making was expensive then.</i>

975
01:25:27,639 --> 01:25:29,199
<i>- Where do I look?
- There.</i>

976
01:25:29,399 --> 01:25:30,679
<i>There, OK...</i>

977
01:25:30,879 --> 01:25:34,079
<i>You can use our phone
to film for the day.</i>

978
01:25:34,279 --> 01:25:35,559
<i>Sure...</i>

979
01:25:37,079 --> 01:25:39,119
<i>Do you want to film
your image of Lafors?</i>

980
01:25:39,279 --> 01:25:41,279
<i>You press record and then stop.</i>

981
01:25:41,479 --> 01:25:44,599
<i>- Do you think I can manage that?
- Y$, you can.</i>

982
01:25:46,759 --> 01:25:50,839
<i>You click on this square.
When you finish filming, it gets saved.</i>

983
01:25:51,039 --> 01:25:55,999
<i>Once you're done, we pick it up,
and you get to be in our film.</i>

984
01:25:57,439 --> 01:25:58,919
<i>Goddamn it.</i>

985
01:25:59,719 --> 01:26:01,199
<i>There we go.</i>

986
01:26:24,519 --> 01:26:27,119
<i>Go away! Stop it!</i>

987
01:26:27,279 --> 01:26:29,119
<i>Stop it, Misha!</i>

988
01:26:30,479 --> 01:26:32,359
<i>Stop it.</i>

989
01:26:35,559 --> 01:26:38,799
<i>It's great.
Everyone knows everyone here.</i>

990
01:26:40,959 --> 01:26:42,359
LAFORS SUCKS

991
01:26:42,559 --> 01:26:47,479
<i>Maybe the air, the wind,
the sound of the water...</i>

992
01:26:48,359 --> 01:26:50,399
<i>the shape of the fountain...</i>

993
01:26:52,399 --> 01:26:55,439
<i>It gives you this feeling... feeling.</i>

994
01:27:00,759 --> 01:27:07,079
<i>There is, or was, the sewing factory
where my mother worked.</i>

995
01:27:07,279 --> 01:27:12,359
<i>She told me how they slaved.
They passed out from exhaustion.</i>

996
01:27:12,559 --> 01:27:16,759
<i>They put the factories out here
because people here didn't make demands.</i>

997
01:27:16,959 --> 01:27:18,599
<i>They wanted food on the table.</i>

998
01:27:21,799 --> 01:27:24,199
<i>I've seen on TV
that in other countries</i>

999
01:27:24,399 --> 01:27:28,319
<i>tannery workers get sick due to
exposure to dangerous chemicals.</i>

1000
01:27:28,519 --> 01:27:31,159
<i>Stop filming, I said.
Stop filming! Cut it out!</i>

1001
01:27:31,359 --> 01:27:32,719
<i>Put the camera away.</i>

1002
01:27:32,919 --> 01:27:36,479
<i>- Stop filming, I said!
- Cocksucker, don't you film Lafors!</i>

1003
01:27:36,679 --> 01:27:38,279
<i>Stockholm asshole!</i>

1004
01:27:38,479 --> 01:27:43,679
<i>Our specialty is magnifying
very tiny insects.</i>

1005
01:27:45,759 --> 01:27:50,159
<i>You discover little details
you would never know about otherwise.</i>

1006
01:27:50,359 --> 01:27:53,759
<i>Take ants, for instance,
if you magnify their feet,</i>

1007
01:27:53,959 --> 01:27:57,679
<i>you wouldn't think they've got hair
between their toes.</i>

1008
01:28:07,879 --> 01:28:10,599
<i>- Did you thank them?
- They didn't give it to me.</i>

1009
01:28:10,839 --> 01:28:13,399
<i>They told me to film.</i>

1010
01:28:13,599 --> 01:28:19,439
<i>We'll see. OK, so film.
Film the tent. Show them.</i>

1011
01:28:19,599 --> 01:28:24,559
<i>Be still so they may see the sky.
The Swedish sky.</i>

1012
01:28:24,759 --> 01:28:26,439
<i>Post it on Facebook.</i>

1013
01:28:30,079 --> 01:28:32,199
<i>What do you think of Superbilly
coming here?</i>

1014
01:28:32,399 --> 01:28:36,119
<i>- Good, I guess.
- Is it good? Why?</i>

1015
01:28:36,319 --> 01:28:37,719
<i>I save more money.</i>

1016
01:28:37,919 --> 01:28:42,159
<i>This is the wrong forum,
the wrong place. It's all wrong.</i>

1017
01:28:56,319 --> 01:29:01,199
<i>Why do you have to film me?
Couldn't you find anything uglier?</i>

1018
01:29:02,119 --> 01:29:04,999
<i>Who do you think is going
to watch this idiocy?</i>

1019
01:30:18,239 --> 01:30:20,719
Hello? How long is this film?

1020
01:30:20,919 --> 01:30:22,519
Five and a half hours.

1021
01:30:30,679 --> 01:30:32,679
You're being so boring!

1022
01:30:33,719 --> 01:30:36,839
<i>Aida! Are you messing with us?</i>

1023
01:30:37,039 --> 01:30:38,919
<i>No!</i>

1024
01:31:20,919 --> 01:31:23,079
<i>My little boy.</i>

1025
01:32:07,359 --> 01:32:13,039
<i>Then we could do the next song
on the same page, "Ida's Summer Song".</i>

1026
01:32:13,239 --> 01:32:14,959
<i>Are you all on page five?</i>

1027
01:32:20,719 --> 01:32:22,759
<i>No, this is no good.</i>

1028
01:32:22,959 --> 01:32:24,839
<i>Can you be quiet while I'm reading?</i>

1029
01:32:28,479 --> 01:32:29,839
<i>Hey, you...</i>

1030
01:32:30,039 --> 01:32:35,079
<i>People are having coffee here.
Maybe you could be considerate of them.</i>

1031
01:32:35,279 --> 01:32:37,919
<i>You're welcome to sing.</i>

1032
01:32:38,119 --> 01:32:40,759
<i>Just keep it down a little.</i>

1033
01:32:40,959 --> 01:32:42,879
<i>OK? Could you...</i>

1034
01:32:47,159 --> 01:32:50,999
<i>Could you be a bit quieter?</i>

1035
01:33:54,279 --> 01:34:01,399
