1
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,400
Where are you going inside?

2
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,000
I have some work inside.

3
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,200
What work do you have inside?

4
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,400
Idiot, this is an asylum.

5
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,200
Only the mad ones can go in.

6
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,600
Idiot, didn't you recognize me?
- No.

7
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,800
I am Chhota Chetan.
- Chhota Chetan?

8
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,000
Yes. Wear the glasses
and watch the drama.

9
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,600
And listen, don't touch the glasses.
- No.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,800
And look, please return the
glasses after the show. Okay?

11
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,600
Chhota.
- Shiva. Shiva. Shiva.

12
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,600
The breeze which douses
the fire of atrocities.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The cure of the pain of the poor.

14
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,400
My name is Shiva.

15
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,400
Shiva. Shiva. Shiva. Shiva. Shiva.

16
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,000
Shiva. Shiva. Shiva. Shiva. Shiva.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,600
Hey, Shiva. Shiva.
- Chhota Chetan?

18
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,800
Come here.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Who has called me?

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,600
Have you seen
Giri Haridhara anywhere?

21
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,800
Idiot, I am Giri Haridhara.
- I am a fool.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,400
But why are you here,
too? Were you caught, too?

23
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,200
No. But the brigadier's
misdeeds are increasing.

24
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,800
He is selling the secrets of
our country to the enemies.

25
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,000
Wretched brigadier.

26
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,200
We have to keep a watch on him.
- Yes.

27
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,200
I need you. Come.
- Sure. Come on.

28
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,200
Hey, who are you?
- Chhota Chetan.

29
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,600
Chhota.
- Yes.

30
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,800
And who is he?

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,400
Mota Chetan.

32
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,400
Who is he?
- Sota Chetan.

33
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,200
Quiet. Let's go.

34
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,200
Come here. Why are you running?

35
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,000
There is a ghost.

36
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,400
Where is the ghost?
- In that post box.

37
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,600
A ghost in the post box?

38
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,600
Ghost. Ghost. Run. Run.
- Ghost.

39
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,600
Inspector Giri Haridhara.

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,400
Yes, Inspector Hari Giridhara.

41
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,000
At what time does the brigadier
leaves his house?

42
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,200
9 o'clock.

43
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,200
I see. And what's the time now?
- 8:45.

44
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,200
I see. It means it is time for breakfast.
- Is it?

45
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,000
Idiot, not yours,
but the brigadier's.

46
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,600
Oh!

47
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,200
Navratan. Navratan. Navratan.

48
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,800
I had told you to bring
the breakfast at 8:44..

49
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,200
..then why have you
brought it at 8:45? Tell me.

50
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,400
Brigadier, why are you shouting?

51
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,800
If you shout so much,
you will get a heart attack.

52
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,600
Then how will you be able to eat all this?
- Yes.

53
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,600
And yes, did you eat that?
- What?

54
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,200
What did you say? That pulp-bulb?

55
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,000
The garlic pulse.
- Yes, you are eating it.

56
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,800
No, it is over. Finished. It's finished.
- I see.

57
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,400
Check the pocket.
- Okay.

58
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,400
Not yours, mine.

59
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,000
Which one?
- The closest one.

60
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,400
Yes, this one.

61
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,200
What is this? Garlic pulse?
My garlic pulse?

62
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,400
Thief. You stole it?

63
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,000
You are too much.
What are you saying?

64
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,400
You are scolding me instead?

65
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,400
When you were throwing this
bottle down the window..

66
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,200
Yes?
- I was standing there to catch it.

67
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,200
It is the last one. What do they call it?
- Warning.

68
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,800
Yes. If you throw it again,
I won't catch it.

69
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,600
I'll get you caught by the doctor.

70
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,200
Enough of the pampering. Call Roma.

71
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,400
- She can't come now.
- Why?

72
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,800
She is applying the
stick on her lips. That lip..

73
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,400
Lipstick.
- Yes, that one.

74
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,200
Does she go to meet someone?
- I think so.

75
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,000
Have you seen how he looks?

76
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,800
No, I've not seen him, but..

77
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,000
Yes, he must be good.
He must be good.

78
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,400
Yes, whose daughter is she?

79
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,600
Whose daughter? Mine. Mine.
- Yes, I am saying that.

80
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,000
Yes. Go away.

81
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,600
Go.
- I am going.

82
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,600
Dear Roma.
- Yes, Daddy?

83
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,800
Won't you have breakfast?

84
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,200
No, Daddy. I am in a hurry today
and I'm getting late for college.

85
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,000
College? But today is Sunday,
how can you go to college?

86
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,600
Actually, Daddy,
I have tuition classes today.

87
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:03,200
Tuition classes? Are you taking tuitions
or someone is giving you?

88
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,600
You are too much, Daddy.
My exams are nearing and I've to go.

89
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,800
Bye, Daddy.

90
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,600
Dear, listen. Introduce me
to your tuition teacher..

91
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,200
..after your exams.

92
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,800
Yes, Daddy.
I'll introduce you to him.

93
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,400
Right. Whose daughter is she?

94
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,200
Inspector.
- Yes.

95
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,400
The brigadier has come.

96
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,400
Really? What is he wearing?

97
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,400
A mini skirt.
- Mini skirt?

98
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,400
Idiot, he is not the brigadier,
but his daughter Roma.

99
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,400
Roma? Then let me follow her alone.

100
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,000
Stupid, we have to follow the brigadier.

101
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,600
Hello?

102
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,800
The cat salutes the dog.

103
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,200
Tell me, boss no. 2,
what's your order?

104
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,200
Reach Hotel Sheesh Mahal at sharp
10:00 today with the documents.

105
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,400
But what about the money?

106
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,400
Sell the stuff with this hand
and take the amount with the other.

107
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,200
Okay, boss. I'll come right now.

108
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,800
Take care. No one should follow you.

109
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,400
Follow me?

110
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,400
Don't laugh.
- Sorry, boss.

111
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,000
I'll come right now.

112
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Come on, hurry up. Hey?

113
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,600
He has run away.

114
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,400
Taxi.
- Taxi.

115
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,000
Hey, taxi. Taxi. Follow that car.
- Yes.

116
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,400
Hurry up.

117
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,800
Hey.

118
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,400
Idiot.
- Slap!

119
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,200
"Follow them."

120
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,200
"Follow them."

121
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,400
"Follow them."

122
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,600
"Follow them."

123
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,800
"Follow them."

124
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:39,400
"Whether it is sunlight or rain,
whether it is day or night."

125
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:45,200
"Whether it is sunlight or rain,
whether it is day or night."

126
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:52,400
"No one should be able
to escape from here."

127
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,400
"Follow them.
- Follow them."

128
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,400
"Follow them.
- Follow them."

129
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,200
"Follow them.
- Follow them."

130
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,800
"Follow them.
- Follow them."

131
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,400
"Listen, sweetheart,
if you want to fall in love.."

132
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,400
"Listen, sweetheart,
if you want to fall in love.."

133
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:08,200
"..settle someone in your
heart here and make him yours."

134
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,600
"Follow them.
- Follow them."

135
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,400
"Follow them.
- Follow them."

136
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,400
"Follow them.
- Follow them."

137
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,800
"Follow them.
- Follow them."

138
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:49,400
"When you have enemies,
whether it is a victory or defeat.."

139
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:55,200
"When you have enemies,
whether it is victory or defeat.."

140
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:02,400
"..no one should be able to
escape from here stealthily."

141
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,400
"Follow them.
- Follow them."

142
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,200
"Follow them.
- Follow them."

143
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,200
"Follow them.
- Follow them."

144
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,400
"Follow them.
- Follow them."

145
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:22,000
"Whether it is sunlight or rain,
whether it is day or night.."

146
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:28,000
"Whether it is sunlight or rain,
whether it is day or night.."

147
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:35,200
"..no one should be able
to escape from here."

148
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,200
"Follow them.
- Follow them."

149
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,000
"Follow them.
- Follow them."

150
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,000
"Follow them.
- Follow them."

151
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,400
"Follow them.
- Follow them."

152
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,800
No one has died today since morning.

153
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,000
Mr. Kandharam.
- What is it?

154
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,600
Take it back.
- Take it back? Why?

155
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,800
That man is still alive.

156
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,800
He is still alive? How?

157
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
He had not died.
He was practicing yoga.

158
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,800
Practicing yoga? What is this?
A joke? He has made me suffer a loss.

159
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,800
Look, it is the rule of my business.

160
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,400
I don't take back
the stuff once I sell it.

161
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,400
It is fine, Kandharam.
But should we do about this stuff now?

162
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,200
Yes. It is right.

163
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,400
You shouldn't be in a loss
and I shouldn't benefit either.

164
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,200
Rastogilal.
- Yes?

165
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,200
Your wife was sick, right?
How is she now?

166
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,200
What should I tell you, Kandharam?

167
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,200
There is a desire till she is breathing.
- Yes.

168
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,400
There are no hopes.

169
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,400
It is possible that
she may die tomorrow or today.

170
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,800
She may die right now.
There is no guarantee, Brother.

171
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,000
There is no guarantee.

172
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,800
Mr. Rastogilal.
- Yes?

173
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Buy this stuff.

174
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,600
Perhaps it may be useful for your wife.
- Yes.

175
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,600
This stuff? It will be useful for you.
For your wife. You die.

176
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,000
Oh, my God.
- May your wife die.

177
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Why should my wife die? Get lost.

178
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,200
They didn't die either.

179
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,400
Vijay.
- Yes, Father?

180
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,400
Where are you going all dressed up?

181
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,600
It is time for us to sit at the shop.

182
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,400
Father, I won't handle this business.

183
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,400
Then will your father sit here?

184
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,000
That's what I'm saying, Daddy.
That father will sit here.

185
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,000
The son won't.

186
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,000
Is this a business?
To sell the funeral items?

187
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,800
If you wanted me to do this,
why did you educate me..

188
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,200
..and made me an engineer?

189
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:35,200
Cheer up, Son. This business has
brought color to your cheeks..

190
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,000
..and you are abusing it?

191
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:41,400
This business can never die and
death is the life of this business.

192
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,800
Lord Krishna had told
Arjun

193
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,200
..about life in 'Ramayana'.

194
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,800
That life is a pleasant
journey where no one knows..

195
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,000
..what will happen tomorrow.

196
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,200
You know it. Who else?
Come on, give me Rs. 30.

197
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,400
Son, what do you know
how much your father loves you?

198
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,400
But you don't care for me.

199
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,400
Dance, my darling,
you will get money.

200
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,800
Where will you find such an adorer?

201
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,200
Who has said it?

202
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,400
The disciples had said this to
Meneka.

203
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,000
Well said. He is my father.

204
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,800
Thief. Thief. Thief.
Someone catch him.

205
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,600
That thief is
running away with my purse.

206
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,200
Why are you shaking
your hands in panic?

207
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,600
Vijay, the thief has
run away with my purse.

208
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,600
He has run away with your purse?
- Yes.

209
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,800
Which purse?
- The white one.

210
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
The white one?
Which I had given you?

211
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,800
Which daddy had given me.
- How was it?

212
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,600
Just like this.

213
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,800
Vijay, it is my purse.

214
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,800
Listen, friend,
her daddy had gifted it to her.

215
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,600
Please return it to her.

216
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,600
Hey? Don't you
understand Hindi? Stop. Wait.

217
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,400
Constable.
- Yes?

218
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,800
The thief has snatched my purse.

219
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,200
He stole your purse?
- Yes.

220
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,800
I'll catch him.
- Here. This way.

221
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,200
This way? Wretched thief.
- Yes.

222
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,800
Come on, give me the purse.
Give me the purse.

223
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,400
Wretched thief.

224
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Lower the dagger. Lower the dagger.
- It's not mine. It's not mine.

225
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,200
The purse is in your hand.
- I didn't steal it. I didn't steal it.

226
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,000
Come to the police station.
- Then let's go to the police station.

227
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,400
Why are you threatening me?
- Leave me.

228
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,600
Am I a thief?
Come on, walk ahead. Go ahead.

229
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,000
Come on, hurry up.

230
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,800
Sir. Sir, I've caught the thief.
I've caught the thief.

231
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,800
Are you crazy? I'm explaining to you
since a while that I'm not a thief.

232
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,000
Firstly, you steal and on the top of it,
you are threatening me?

233
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,200
You have the purse in
your hand, don't you?

234
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,600
Oh, this purse?
First the thief had stolen it.

235
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,000
Then the other thief
snatched it from him.

236
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,800
Then I snatched it from him. Then?

237
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,400
You didn't snatch it, you stole it.

238
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,400
It means you are thief no. 3.

239
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,200
I didn't steal it. It is my purse.

240
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,600
It is a ladies purse.
- Yes.

241
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,200
Now you will say the
lady is yours, too.

242
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,400
She is definitely mine.

243
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,800
He is such a flirt, sir.

244
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,400
He says Mary, the purse and
the lady belongs to him, too.

245
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,200
Do you understand him?
- I don't understand anything.

246
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,400
I don't understand it either.

247
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,600
Snatch away his dagger.
I'll put him behind bars.

248
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,800
Wait. Wait.
Why are you putting him behind bars?

249
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,600
He is not a thief. He is my fiancé.

250
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,400
Did you hear? I am her fiancé.

251
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,600
And this purse belongs to me.
- Yes.

252
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,000
If it is your purse,
then why did he steal it?

253
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,200
And he also has a dagger
in his hand.

254
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,800
Look, I'll tell you what happened.

255
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,000
I was standing there. The thief came
and ran away with my purse.

256
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,800
Then the other thief came
and stood beside me.

257
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,400
Then Vijay came and
he ran away, too.

258
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,800
I didn't run. I was chasing
the thief to get your purse.

259
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,400
Yes. First the thief ran away.
Then Vijay ran away.

260
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,600
Then the constable ran away as well.

261
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,800
Why are you creating the
dilemma of running away?

262
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,200
As it is, he couldn't understand anything.
- Vijay, keep quiet.

263
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,200
I am explaining to him
since a while.

264
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,200
He is hell bent on putting me behind bars.
- Please, Vijay.

265
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,000
Shut up.

266
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,400
Is she your lady?
- Yes.

267
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,200
Lady, is it your purse?
- Yes, it is mine.

268
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,200
Now get out.
- Go.

269
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,400
Thank you very much.
- Go.

270
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,600
Take the dagger.
- Keep it down.

271
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,000
Come on, let's go.

272
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
If you see their
faces in the morning..

273
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,000
..your entire day is spoiled.

274
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,000
Oh, a ghost.

275
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,600
Constable. Constable.
- What's wrong?

276
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,800
There is a ghost on the tree.

277
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,600
There is a ghost?
My duty is not on this road..

278
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,600
..I am appointed on that road.

279
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,800
Please come.
Come and check what's wrong.

280
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,800
What?
- Yes.

281
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,200
I had warned you not to
put a flower on the tree.

282
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,800
But I had put it up for decoration.

283
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,800
Decoration?
A rose flower on a sacred fig tree? Idiot.

284
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,400
Oh, sorry.
The constable is coming this way.

285
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,200
Please come.
- Where?

286
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,200
The ghost was here.

287
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,400
Here?
- Yes.

288
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Oh, where is it?

289
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,800
You adorn it.
- Should I?

290
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,600
No ghost. Go.
- Thank you.

291
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,400
It's fine. She was saying
that there is a ghost here.

292
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,200
Oh, my God.

293
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,400
A ghost.

294
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,600
The cat salutes the dog.

295
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,400
The cat salutes the dog.

296
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,000
Come to Rockan Road
exactly at 10:00 am today.

297
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:14,000
Yes, I've understood.
But what about the butter and cream?

298
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,200
You will get everything.
Bring the bread.

299
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,000
Shut up.
- Sorry.

300
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,400
I will come just now.

301
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Inspector, the enemy is escaping.
- Really?

302
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,200
Come on, follow him.
- Follow him.

303
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,000
Hurry up. Taxi.
- Taxi.

304
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,400
Taxi.
- Taxi.

305
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,800
Hey, taxi driver.
- Taxi.

306
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,400
Driver, follow that car.
- Driver, follow him.

307
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,000
All right, sir.
- Follow him.

308
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,800
Oh, my God. Ghost. Ghost.

309
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,600
Hey, what are you doing?
- Oh, God.

310
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,600
Ghost. Ghost.

311
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,000
Driver, don't go. Driver, don't go.
- Ghost.

312
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,600
The cat salutes the dog.

313
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,800
The dog salutes the cat.

314
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,400
The map?
- I've brought it.

315
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,200
Check it.

316
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,400
Excellent.

317
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,800
But it is the
question of satisfying my hunger.

318
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,000
Eat the bread. Count it.

319
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,200
I trust you.

320
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,000
No.
- Yes.

321
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,000
Inspector Giri Haridhara.

322
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,400
Yes, Inspector Hari Haridhara.

323
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,800
It is very shameful for us.

324
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,400
We are following that
brigadier since three months..

325
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,600
.. but we have been
unable to catch him yet.

326
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Yes. But, Inspector Hari Haridhara,
what proof do we have..

327
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,600
..that this brigadier is
selling the secrets of our country..

328
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,600
..to the enemy countries?

329
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,800
We will get the evidence
if we're able to catch him red-handed.

330
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,800
But he is giving us
the slip since three months.

331
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,600
Why shouldn't we enter
his bungalow and catch him?

332
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,600
Idiot, first we want the evidence.

333
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,600
Secondly, we can't go before him.

334
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,800
He knows us. He recognizes us.

335
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,600
If we go before him,
then everything will be ruined.

336
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,400
All our efforts will go waste.

337
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,400
Oh, then what should we do?

338
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,600
Then what?

339
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,800
I've thought of a new idea for it.
- What?

340
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,600
We'll follow his daughter.

341
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,400
It is possible that we may
get some clues from her.

342
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,800
Yes. Good idea.
- Thank you.

343
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,200
Show me the slides.
- Yes.

344
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,800
Sri Devi?
- No.

345
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,200
Radha?
- No.

346
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,400
She is Roma.

347
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:57,800
"You come and leave with a chime,
giving me a glimpse."

348
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,200
"You come and leave with a chime,
giving me a glimpse."

349
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,200
"I am thirsty. You are a cloud."

350
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:11,200
"Come and quench my thirst."

351
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,200
"Come here."

352
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,400
"Fair lass, come here."

353
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,600
"Come here."

354
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,000
"Fair lass, come here."

355
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:31,400
"Why do you give me
such alluring glances?"

356
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:37,600
"Why do you give me
such alluring glances?"

357
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:44,600
"What is our relationship?
Get out of my way."

358
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,800
"Go away."

359
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:51,000
"Lad, go away."

360
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,800
"Go. Go away."

361
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,200
"Lad, go away. "

362
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,400
"There are buds in the gardens."

363
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:41,200
"Fragrance in the buds.
Your youth is full of fragrance."

364
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,200
"There are buds in the gardens."

365
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:50,200
"Fragrance in the buds.
Your youth is full of fragrance."

366
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,400
"Crazy beloved, don't follow me."

367
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,800
"Don't tell me a fake story."

368
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
"You are a branch full of flowers."

369
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:03,200
"You are a branch full of flowers."

370
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:07,200
"Don't pierce the thorns
in my heart."

371
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,000
"Come here."

372
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,400
"Fair lass, come here."

373
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,400
"Go away."

374
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,600
"Lad, go away."

375
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,200
"Don't hold my wrist like this."

376
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,400
"The world will watch,
I'll be put to shame."

377
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,800
"Don't hold my wrist like this."

378
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,000
"The world will watch,
I'll be put to shame."

379
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,400
"I can't bear this distance."

380
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,800
"Your separation
won't let me survive."

381
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,600
"Oh, crazy beloved.
- Yes."

382
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,200
"My heart knows.
- Yes."

383
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:39,000
"Oh, crazy beloved,
my heart knows your intentions."

384
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
"Go away."

385
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,800
"Lad, go away."

386
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,600
"Come here."

387
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:52,200
"Fair lass, come here."

388
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:32,000
"There is shell in the sea.
A pearl in the shell."

389
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
"Your body is like a pearl."

390
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,800
"There is shell in the sea.
A pearl in the shell."

391
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:45,200
"Your body is like a pearl."

392
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,000
"Why has a pain
aroused in your heart.."

393
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,800
"..on seeing my fair body?"

394
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,200
"After coming close to my heart,
after stealing my heart."

395
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,000
"After coming close to my heart,
after stealing my heart."

396
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:02,200
"Don't make me so desperate."

397
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,200
"Come here."

398
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,400
"Fair lass, come here."

399
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,600
"Go away."

400
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,800
"Lad, go away."

401
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,400
"Come here."

402
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:27,400
"Go away."

403
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,400
Roma. Roma.

404
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,600
Roma.
- Yes, Daddy?

405
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:57,400
You are lying on the carpet,
with a rose flower in your hand..

406
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:01,800
..and humming a song,
it proves that you are in love.

407
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,000
No, Daddy. It is not so.

408
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,600
It is so. Who is he?
What is his name?

409
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,600
Tell me. Why are you panicking?

410
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,400
When I had fallen in
love with your mother..

411
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,200
Well. Forget it. Who is he?
What is his name?

412
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,600
Vijay.
- Where is he? Tell me?

413
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I want to meet him.

414
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,800
Okay, Daddy.
I'll introduce him to you.

415
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,400
Soon.
- Yes.

416
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,600
"Darling, I'll get out of your way."

417
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
"I go under a train.."

418
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,000
Spit. Spit.

419
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,800
Why? What's your problem?

420
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,200
Mosquito bite?

421
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,000
I can do this dance, too.

422
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,000
I've seen it twelve times.
'Enter The Dragon'.

423
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,200
Get it?

424
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,200
We had been ordered to
attack right at 6:30.

425
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,200
Alpha Bravo Charlie 1.
Order. Attack.

426
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,400
Attack. We heard the
sound of fire from the front.

427
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,400
We fired with our machine guns.

428
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,000
After that, I saw the air-force.
The aero-planes were landing.

429
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,400
After that, I saw a man sitting in front.

430
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,800
I picked up my gun,
aimed it at him and fired.

431
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,800
Oh, my God.

432
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,000
Hey, what's wrong?

433
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,200
Sir, I think China has attacked again.
- Oh, China?

434
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,800
I think my Kung-fu master has come.

435
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,000
Kung-fu?
- Yes. Come. Come.

436
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,400
Help.
- Hey?

437
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,800
Yes, come. How are you?
- Fine.

438
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,600
Go and bring milk for sir.

439
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,200
Yes, serve him milk.

440
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,400
My tooth is broken
and I should serve him milk, too.

441
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,000
He will thrash me more
after drinking the milk.

442
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,800
He is Bruce Lee's far-off relative.
Chus Lee.

443
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,400
Who?
- Yes, Chus Lee.

444
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,600
Chus Lee.

445
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,400
It's fine.

446
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,400
Have milk.

447
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,200
But, Daddy,
why have you called him here?

448
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:13,200
I've called him here because
he is the most dangerous..

449
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,800
..Kung-fu master of this city.
Understood?

450
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:19,600
I want to show him that
my son-in-law is no less.

451
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,800
You call Vijay here tomorrow itself.

452
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,400
And tell him to fight with this demon.

453
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,200
He should change Chus Lee to Moos-Lee.
- Okay.

454
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,000
Then I'll see whether my son-in-law
is worthy or worthless.

455
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Yes, Daddy.

456
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,000
Roma, why don't you tell
me frankly that your daddy..

457
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,200
..wants me to die?

458
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,600
He wants to kill me.

459
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,200
You had told me yesterday that
you can give up your life for me.

460
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,800
You can get the stars from the sky.

461
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,600
A man talks lot of nonsense in love.

462
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,800
Is all of it true?

463
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,200
Can anyone get the stars
from the sky?

464
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,000
It means your love is fake.

465
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,400
You are too much.
I can love you only if I am alive.

466
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,400
And that Kung-fu master will kill me.

467
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,000
Just make one attempt, Vijay.

468
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,600
Defeat him just once.

469
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,200
This means you want to kill me, too.

470
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,000
No, Vijay, I want to marry you.

471
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,600
Why me? Marry that wretched
Kung-fu master after I die.

472
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,400
Oh, come on, Vijay.

473
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:16,000
What not people do in love and
you can't do this much for me?

474
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,600
You are under the oath of my love.

475
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,800
It is impossible. It is impossible.
I can't fight with him.

476
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,800
You will fight.
You will definitely fight.

477
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,400
You will not only fight,
but defeat him, too.

478
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,600
How will I defeat him?
Is it so easy?

479
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,200
How will I defeat him?
- Listen, I'll tell you.

480
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,600
Look, if anything goes wrong,
I'll definitely die.

481
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,000
It is my work to placate Navratan.

482
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,200
Come on.

483
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,800
Oh God!

484
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,600
Inspector Giri Haridhara.

485
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,400
Yes, Inspector Hari Haridhara.

486
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Did you understand anything?
- Of course.

487
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,200
It means we will have
to play some new drama.

488
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,600
And the name of that
drama will be blackmail.

489
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,600
I see. You mean the black market.
- Yes.

490
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,600
Hey, the constable.

491
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,400
Hey? There is a ghost here, too. Run.

492
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,600
I can't find the sugar jar.
Have you seen it anywhere?

493
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,600
She sells really stale fish.
She sells really stale fish.

494
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,400
I have scolded her a lot.

495
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,600
I scolded her so much that
I burst into tears, too.

496
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,200
But why are you so panicky?
I didn't see anything.

497
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,000
What are you saying?
You didn't see anything?

498
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,200
Yes, I didn't see anything.

499
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,200
You didn't see anything?
- Yes, I didn't see anything.

500
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,000
Good. I am saved.
- Yes.

501
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Okay, Navratan.
- Yes?

502
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,200
You will have to do a favor for me.

503
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,000
Will you do it?
- No.

504
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,000
What?
- I'll do it.

505
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,400
Listen..
- What are you saying?

506
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,600
You are saying it,
but I'll have to do it.

507
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:04,200
If brigadier sir comes to know,
he will fire me.

508
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,400
If daddy had seen the fish
you were frying just now..

509
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,200
..he would have shot you.

510
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,200
But he had not seen it.

511
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,200
Navratan, I have seen everything.

512
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,800
What are you saying?

513
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:22,800
Look, please save my life.
I won't leave your feet.

514
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,800
Navratan.
- I won't leave them.

515
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,800
What about my work?

516
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,200
Your work will be done,
but I won't leave your feet.

517
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,000
Okay, leave my feet.
- No, I won't leave them.

518
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,800
Okay, don't leave them.
- I won't.

519
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,200
The more tax you pay,
he lesser water supply you get.

520
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,000
Did it come?
- No.

521
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,400
How much more should I try to open it?
- A little more.

522
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,600
I can't open it anymore.
- Let it be. I'll manage with it.

523
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:45,000
Hey? You have uprooted the flower.
Who are you?

524
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,000
Gardener, call your master.
- What?

525
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,800
Call your master. Call your master.
- What?

526
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,200
Why are you stammering?
Are you deaf? Call your master.

527
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,200
What if I say that I am the master?

528
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:58,000
I'll tell sir and get you fired.
- Hey, you..

529
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,800
Vijay, it's him.

530
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,400
Yes, he is here.
I am saying the same.

531
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,800
But he is not calling your daddy.

532
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,600
Vijay, he is daddy.
- Daddy? Oh, Daddy. Daddy.

533
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,000
Daddy, please forgive me.
I am sorry.

534
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,000
I didn't recognize you.
I am sorry. I am sorry.

535
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,800
Daddy, he is Vijay.
- Vijay, he is my daddy.

536
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,200
Hello.
- Hello.

537
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,000
I think you master the
art of Kung-fu karate.

538
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,200
I am an expert.

539
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,400
From whom did you learn it?
- From Roma.

540
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,800
What?
- I mean from Romanchi. Romanchi.

541
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,400
Yes, he is a Chinese.

542
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,000
Yes. His eyes are like this, too.
- Yes. All right.

543
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,600
My black-belt is about to come now.

544
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,400
Come on, let's wait for him. Come.
- All right.

545
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,000
What if my enthusiasm cools
down by then?

546
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,800
No, we will keep it boiling. Come.

547
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,800
Please come.
- Where is your black-belt?

548
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,800
He is about to come. He'll come just now.
- Call him soon.

549
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,800
He is ready.
- Yes, Daddy.

550
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,200
Help. He has come. He has come.

551
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,600
He has come.
- He has come?

552
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,000
Yes, he is his son.

553
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,600
His father Guth Lee
was faster than him.

554
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:27,800
Good morning.

555
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,800
Not good morning.
He is saying that he wants milk.

556
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,200
Navratan.
- Yes, sir?

557
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,400
Please bring.. I
mean bring milk for him.

558
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,400
I'll bring it right away.

559
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,400
Vijay, he is Chus Lee,
son of Guth Lee.

560
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,600
And he is Vijay.

561
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Yes, he is saying that
he will kill you. Yes.

562
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,200
Navratan, come quickly.

563
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,600
Will you start the
competition now or later?

564
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,600
After drinking the milk.
- Oh, after drinking the milk.

565
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,200
The fun will begin now.

566
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,600
Navratan is making
your arrangements.

567
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,600
Now I'll come to know whether
your choice is worthy or worthless.

568
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,400
Navratan, hurry up.

569
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,400
The competition has to begin.

570
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,200
Why are you falling? You
have to drink it. Hey, idiot.

571
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,200
Your milk will be brought just now.
Drink it properly.

572
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,800
After that, I'll thrash you.
Do you know Hindi?

573
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,200
Good. I'll make mincemeat of you.
I'll make cutlets of you.

574
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:55,400
Come here. Give it to him quickly.
Give him the milk.

575
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,200
What will happen to you
after you are thrashed up?

576
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,600
Take it, Brother.

577
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,800
Give it to him.

578
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,400
Done? Come on.

579
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,200
Oh, my God. I think he forgot.

580
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,000
I think father will
take my measurement.

581
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,600
From where have you come?

582
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,600
Oh, my God.

583
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,800
What are you doing?

584
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,800
So he knows Kung-fu?
He knows Karate?

585
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Hey, Brother, stop. Brother,
Indians and Chinese are brothers.

586
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,800
Time, please. Time, please.
It really hurts. It really hurts.

587
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,000
What's wrong with him?
Don't kick me. Don't kick me.

588
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,600
Don't kick me. What has
happened to him?

589
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,600
Help.

590
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,200
Will he bite me?

591
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,400
I think the drug is showing
it's effect on brother China.

592
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:05,400
Is he intoxicated?
Come on. Come on.

593
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,400
Chinese guy, hit me.

594
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,000
Take this. And this.
Take some more. Take some more.

595
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,600
Wretched guy, I'll show you.

596
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,400
Come on, Vijay.

597
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,800
Roma. Roma, live long.

598
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,800
Well done, Vijay.

599
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,600
May your daddy live long, too.

600
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,200
Navratan, live long
as well. Me, too..

601
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,200
Be careful.

602
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,200
Cheers to me, too.

603
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,400
Well done. Come, Son.

604
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,800
Son, you are really made of iron.
- Yes.

605
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,200
I accept you.

606
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,400
Come and hug me, Son.

607
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,000
My son.

608
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,000
Vijay, daddy is not here, but there.
- Come, Son.

609
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,800
Come.

610
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,400
Chus Lee?

611
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:06,200
The bus fell in a pit.
15 persons have died. Thank God.

612
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,600
Hello?

613
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,000
Look, it's me speaking.

614
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,800
You always tell me that
I don't know how to cook food.

615
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,600
I have prepared chicken today.

616
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,800
Really? Chicken?

617
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,400
And listen, there is no one at home.

618
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,400
I am alone. Come soon.

619
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,200
Who is speaking?

620
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,000
Don't you recognize my voice?

621
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,200
It's me, Roma.

622
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:30,800
Roma? Speak up, Roma.
Hello? What is your address?

623
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,600
What? Who is speaking?

624
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Father, fire. Douse the fire, Father.
Douse the fire, Father.

625
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,000
Extinguish it quickly. I'll die.
- I am coming.

626
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Who? - It's me speaking.
- Hurry up. I am dead. Save me.

627
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,000
Oh, God. Come on,
extinguish the fire.

628
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,000
What are you doing?
I'll die. Pour some water.

629
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,000
Rastogi.
- Yes?

630
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,200
How is your wife now?

631
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:56,000
She may die tomorrow,
today or right now.

632
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,000
God willing, she'll die soon.

633
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:26,400
"Return home early
every evening, beloved."

634
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:32,600
"Return home early
every evening, beloved."

635
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:38,200
"Don't get trapped in any work."

636
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:44,200
"I'll cook your favorite dish."

637
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,800
"I'll cook your favorite dish."

638
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:55,200
"I'll cook chicken for you."

639
00:39:55,400 --> 00:40:00,000
"I'll cook chicken for you."

640
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,400
"I'll cook your favorite dish."

641
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:08,800
"I'll cook chicken for you."

642
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:13,400
"I'll cook chicken for you."

643
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,000
"Cock-a-doodle-doo."

644
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,200
"Cock-a-doodle-doo."

645
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:48,000
"Promise to take me to watch movies."

646
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:54,000
"Promise to take me to watch movies."

647
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,400
"Won't you take me for an outing?"

648
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,800
"You will have a
holiday on every Sunday."

649
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:08,000
"Won't you celebrate?
Won't you celebrate?"

650
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:14,200
"I'll decorate the bed
with chosen flowers."

651
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:18,400
"I'll cook chicken for you."

652
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:23,600
"I'll cook chicken for you."

653
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:53,600
"Never give any fake excuses."

654
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,400
"Never give any fake excuses."

655
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:04,000
"Never fall in love
with any other woman."

656
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,400
"Don't hurt my heart
which is full of desires."

657
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:13,600
"Don't hurt my heart.
Don't hurt my heart."

658
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:19,800
"I'll tolerate all your tantrums."

659
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,200
"I'll cook chicken for you."

660
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:29,200
"I'll cook chicken for you."

661
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,200
"Cock-a-doodle-doo."

662
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,800
"Cock-a-doodle-doo."

663
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,400
Father, you are roaming in an underwear
and a vest during the day?

664
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,400
So many passers-by can
see it. It looks so bad.

665
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,600
It looks bad? And do these red
lipstick marks suit your cheek?

666
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,800
You don't care for my respect at all?

667
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,400
Instead of flirting, it's better to bring
a daughter-in-law to our house.

668
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,800
Hey, who is Roma?

669
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,000
Roma? There is no Roma.

670
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,600
Son, you are fooling me?

671
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,000
Listen. Go and tell
her father to come home..

672
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,200
..and talk about your marriage with me.

673
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,600
I am the boy's father after all,
not a vest seller.

674
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
You are the boy's father,
but he resides in a royal palace.

675
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,400
Will he come to this place
where funeral items are sold..

676
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,000
..and the people roam half clad?

677
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,400
He will never come.

678
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,600
Don't come. I will go there.
I don't care for my respect.

679
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
I do care for it.

680
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,200
I will give him respect.

681
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,400
I am the girl's father.
I'll have to go to him.

682
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,600
What if I am rich?

683
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,800
But, Daddy, his
father doesn't stay here.

684
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Then where does he stay?
- Buckingham palace.

685
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,200
Buckingham? In London?

686
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,400
In London? Yes, Daddy, in London.

687
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:39,200
In London?
Hey, London is not on the moon.

688
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,400
I will go there.
You give me his address.

689
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,200
But, Daddy,
I don't know the address.

690
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,000
Then find it out.
- Yes, I'll find it out.

691
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,000
Yes, find it out.
- Find it out, Daddy.

692
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,600
Find out the address
and I'll reach there.

693
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,800
He stays at the Buckingham palace?

694
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,800
You are too much. You talk
whatever comes to your mind.

695
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,600
Then what else I would have done?
- What you would have done?

696
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:58,600
If your daddy comes to
know that my father sells..

697
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,000
..funeral items
wearing undergarments..

698
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,200
..at shop no. 3 in Dongri,
then he will shoot our entire family.

699
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,600
I don't know anything.

700
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,200
I said what I had to.

701
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,000
Now you will have to do some drama.
- I'll have to do a drama?

702
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,600
If I was supposed to do a drama,
you should have..

703
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,200
..informed me before hand
about what you are going to do.

704
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,000
At least you should have
called up and consulted me.

705
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,600
Do you find it so
difficult to make a call?

706
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,800
Inspector Hari Haridhara.
- Yes, sir?

707
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,400
Let's go. Okay?

708
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,200
Idiot.

709
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,400
Vijay, daddy must be coming.
- So soon?

710
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,200
Vijay, why are you so nervous?

711
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,800
Sit proudly.
You are the boy's father.

712
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,800
Can a goat sit
proudly in a lion's cage?

713
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,000
What nonsense are you
talking early in the morning?

714
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:35,200
I'm going to call daddy.

715
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:36,400
Why are you leaving me alone?

716
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,000
Vijay, will it look good if
I'm sitting here with you?

717
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:39,400
I'll send chilled sherbet for you.

718
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,200
Look, don't be nervous. I am going.

719
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:44,000
Send the sherbet quickly.
With a dash of ice.

720
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,000
Navratan.
- Yes, sir.

721
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:53,000
How many are they?
- Only one, sir.

722
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,000
And sherbet?
- Two glasses, sir.

723
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,200
I see. One man and
two glasses of sherbet.

724
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,200
It is not fair.
- Yes, sir.

725
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Yes. It's fine now.

726
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:15,200
One man and one glass
of sherbet. Only one.

727
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,400
Now I'll turn this tray.

728
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:23,400
Now which glass contains the sherbet,
I don't know anything.

729
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,400
I am loyal to sir.
You drink the sherbet.

730
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:36,400
He is done for.
I'll have to do something.

731
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:56,200
Hello.
- Hello.

732
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,200
Hello. Hello.

733
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:00,600
Have a seat.
- Thanks.

734
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:01,600
Please sit.

735
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:05,800
I am very glad to meet you.
You, too?

736
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,600
Yes. Me, too. Me, too.

737
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,200
No, I think you are not
very happy to meet me.

738
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,000
I am very glad. Very glad.

739
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,200
Very glad?
- Very glad.

740
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:16,000
You are my son-in-law's father,
right? - Me? I am.. Yes.

741
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,600
Yes, I am his father.

742
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,200
Why do you seem so nervous?

743
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:25,400
Actually.. the weather is bad.
- Yes.

744
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:26,600
So you are feeling unwell, too.
- Yes, I am feeling unwell.

745
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,400
You feel unwell.
- Yes, you know it.

746
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,200
It seems worse, too.
- Yes, it is worse today.

747
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,200
Yes. You stay in London, right?

748
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:37,400
I stay at Dongri lane..
Yes, Dongri Lane.. London.

749
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:38,600
I stay in London.

750
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,000
Where is Dongri Lane in London?

751
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,400
Where is the bathroom?
- My bath.. My bathroom?

752
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:45,600
I have to go, it's an emergency.

753
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:49,400
Yes. Go straight from here
and take a left. - Really?

754
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,400
There is a door on
the right, go there.

755
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,600
Thanks.
- It's okay.

756
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:56,000
I feel like visiting the
bathroom on seeing your gun.

757
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,800
You are fleeing?
- Yes, I am fleeing, Brother.

758
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
I knew you will run away.
- Really?

759
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,200
Where are you going?
- I'm going home.

760
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,400
Vijay, what's wrong?

761
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:08,600
Roma, if I knew that your father
roams around with such a big gun..

762
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:11,400
..I'd have never
fallen in love with you.

763
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:12,600
Please forgive me. I am sorry.

764
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:13,600
What are you doing? What
a strange man you are!

765
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:14,800
You are getting so
scared inspite of being a man.

766
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,200
Yes, I am very scared.

767
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,200
But why?
- For the sake of my life.

768
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,400
Then drink this.
- What is this?

769
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:19,800
The medicine of manliness
and courage.

770
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:22,200
Even a coward becomes brave.

771
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:23,400
Does her father drink this?
- Yes, drink it. Drink it.

772
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:24,800
Then give me.
- Here.

773
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:26,400
Here.

774
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:32,000
Excuse me. Will you
please shift there? - Pardon?

775
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,400
I'll find it easier to
spread my legs. - Sure.

776
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,400
Sit.
- Please sit. Please sit.

777
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:40,400
Now ask what you want to ask.
- Well, I..

778
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:41,800
What will you ask? I'll ask you.

779
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,200
Do you feel the sun at home, too?
- Sun?

780
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,400
Then why are you wearing this cap?
- Sorry.

781
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:47,800
Yes.
- I've got used to it.

782
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,600
Keep your gun there, too.

783
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:53,000
Yes, keep it there. That's it.

784
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:57,400
Have you seen that of our Lizy?
- See what of Lizy?

785
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:00,800
Our Elizabeth, the queen of London.

786
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,000
Queen Elizabeth?
- Yes.

787
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,400
Queen Elizabeth.
- She is my childhood friend.

788
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:07,000
I see. - Have you seen her
Buckingham Palace?

789
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,400
No, I haven't.

790
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,200
Yes. Your house is
very small compared to it.

791
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,800
It is like a hut.
- Yes. Yes, it's small.

792
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,200
It is very small.
- Yes.

793
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,800
And her daughter-in-law Rehana.

794
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,800
Rehana? No, lady Diana.

795
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:24,400
Yes, I lovingly call her Rehana.
- Rehana. I see.

796
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:28,000
What should I hide from you now?
Her child, you know.. - Yes?

797
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,400
He resembles me a lot.

798
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:31,000
His hair is white, too?

799
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,200
Yes. No, they are golden now.
- Really?

800
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,000
They will turn white in the future.
- I see. I see.

801
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,400
And he loves me very much.
- Really?

802
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:39,600
He doesn't drink milk till I
don't tell him a story. - I see.

803
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:42,400
But why are you crying?

804
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,600
I remembered my Rehana's child.

805
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:47,600
I wonder how he must be
going to sleep hungry..

806
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,400
..without hearing my story.
- Yes.

807
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,600
What do you do with lady Diana?

808
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:59,200
Yes, her bodyguard. Bodyguard.
- Right. Bodyguard.

809
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:01,400
Yes, bodyguard.
- Your English is good.

810
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,400
Yes.
- But your house is very small.

811
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:04,600
Yes.
- Well..

812
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:08,400
Well, forget it now. Forget
Rehana's child. - All right.

813
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:09,600
You just tell me, how do
you like my daughter..

814
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:13,400
.. in the form of your
daughter-in-law?

815
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:15,400
Your daughter is a top item.
- What?

816
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:20,000
I mean she is a very decent
and beautiful girl. - Yes.

817
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,800
And I'm doing all this for her sake.
- Yes.

818
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,800
I wanted to ask you..
- Yes?

819
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,400
You know that she is
my only daughter. - Yes.

820
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,400
I really love her.
- Very good.

821
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,400
I can't separate her from myself.
- Oh, I see.

822
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:35,600
So will your son live
with me as my son-in-law?

823
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,000
He will definitely stay. He
will definitely stay here.

824
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:40,400
Though your house is very small,
he will surely stay here.

825
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:42,600
In fact, I would have stayed here as
your live-in brother-in-law as well..

826
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,600
.. but Rehana's child
doesn't drink milk..

827
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,800
..without hearing a story from me.
- Yes.

828
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,600
But you will attend
the wedding, won't you?

829
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:51,200
Of course.
I'll definitely attend it.

830
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,000
I'll definitely come.
And he'll come, too.

831
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,200
My son.. what is his name?
- Vijay. Vijay.

832
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,600
Yes, he will come, too.

833
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,200
So shall I consider
the alliance fixed?

834
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:02,600
Yes. Definitely. It is definitely
fixed. Wear your cap now.

835
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:03,800
Okay. All right.

836
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:07,200
By the way, your house
is very small.

837
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:08,200
How do I look?

838
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:11,000
You are fine, but your poor
house is small. - It's small.

839
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,600
Oh, Kandharam.
- Catch him.

840
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:17,800
Wait.

841
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,000
Hurry up. Hurry up. Catch him.

842
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,000
Idiot.
- Shut up.

843
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:33,400
Please attend the wedding.
- Sure.

844
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:34,600
Hello.
- Hello.

845
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:37,400
Hello. Daughter-in-law.

846
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:40,200
Daughter-in-law,
please give me the towel.

847
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,800
Daughter-in-law? Who are you?

848
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:45,400
I am your would-be brother-in-law.
Vijay's father.

849
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:48,400
Vijay's father?
Vijay's father is sitting before me..

850
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:49,600
..so where did the
other father come from?

851
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:50,800
I have come from the shop.

852
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,800
Look, this is the result
of living in a small house.

853
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,600
Anyone barges in unclad.

854
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,000
What do you mean by unclad?

855
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,800
I had worn my clothes,
but they came off on the way.

856
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,200
Who is he?
- He..

857
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:01,200
I am Vijay's father.
- He is Vijay's father.

858
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:04,400
Vijay's father? Then
whose father am I?

859
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:05,600
You must know it.

860
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,600
I'll tell you who you are.
- Yes.

861
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:09,800
You have come from the asylum.
You are mad.

862
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,400
I am mad?
- Yes.

863
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:14,400
You are mad. Your father is mad.
Your family is mad.

864
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:15,800
Shall I shoot you?

865
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Please sit. Let's talk about dowry.
Please sit.

866
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,800
Now a man in his underwear
will talk with you about dowry?

867
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,000
I am going.

868
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,800
Wait, you don't go.
- Thanks.

869
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:25,000
You may go.

870
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
I won't go.

871
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:28,600
You won't go?
- No.

872
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:29,800
Then I'll shoot you.

873
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:32,400
I'll see you..

874
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
I won't let this wedding take place.

875
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
How you won't let it take place?

876
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:38,200
I will cancel it.
- I'll shoot you.

877
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:39,400
I will never let it happen.
I won't let it happen.

878
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:42,400
I am sorry. Wonder what
type of people enter my house.

879
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,200
That underwear with a lining..

880
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:47,000
I won't let this wedding take place.
- Out.

881
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,400
I will see you.
- Hey, my towel.

882
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:51,800
I won't let this wedding take place.

883
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
I will cancel this wedding.

884
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:58,400
If you are a brigadier,
I know the fire brigade, too.

885
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,200
I'll call them and wash you away.

886
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:01,800
This is my towel.

887
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:03,400
I'll wash the towel, too.

888
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:05,200
What do you think of me?

889
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:07,200
I will go to the washerman.

890
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,800
Hello.

891
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,200
Excellent.

892
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,400
Who are you?
- Quiet.

893
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,400
What is going on?
- Yes. Ready.

894
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:30,600
Leave my hands.

895
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,600
One more, please.

896
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:33,800
What is this joke? Who are you two?

897
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,600
Your father.

898
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:37,400
What do you mean?

899
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:39,600
When you can become your father..

900
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,400
So can't we become your father?

901
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:45,800
Come with us quietly.

902
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:49,400
Where are you taking me?

903
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,000
Come with us quietly.

904
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:53,200
Otherwise we'll even remove
your clothes like..

905
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:55,000
..this beard and moustache.

906
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,600
No, no, not my clothes.
Where are you taking me?

907
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:01,400
Your would-be father-in-law
is a big cheat and a traitor.

908
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:02,600
Do you know this?

909
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,200
Do you know this?
- Yes.

910
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:05,400
Then why are you asking me?

911
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,800
To increase your general knowledge.

912
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,200
We also know that you
have just met your..

913
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:13,800
..would-be father-in-law in
disguise of your own father.

914
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:16,200
You know this. You know that.
You know everything.

915
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:17,800
You have a lot of information.
- Yes.

916
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:19,000
Then there is no problem.
- Yes.

917
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Goodbye. I am going.
- Bye.

918
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,800
Sit down. Sit down.

919
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:24,800
We know everything,
but perhaps you don't know..

920
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,400
..that your photographs
which we have clicked..

921
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:27,800
.. if we send them to brigadier..

922
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,200
..he will think of you
as a fraud and shoot you.

923
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,600
But you both won't give those
photographs to the brigadier.

924
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:34,800
You are decent men.
Why would you do this?

925
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:35,800
You will never do this.
- Yes.

926
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
You can stop us if you want.

927
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,200
I really want you to stop.

928
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,200
But what do you want
in return of it?

929
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:43,400
Inspector.
- We are the secret CBI officers.

930
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:48,600
We can't catch him red-handed,
so we want you to do this for us.

931
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:49,800
Why me?

932
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,400
Because you are going to
become his son-in-law soon.

933
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:52,400
Live-in son-in-law.

934
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,800
Live-in son-in-law? No. No.
- Yes. Yes.

935
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,600
Yes, a live-in son-in-law.

936
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:59,000
No one will ever doubt you.

937
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:00,600
And you'll be able
to follow him easily.

938
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,200
You can find out where
the brigadier goes..

939
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:03,600
..whom he meets, what he does..

940
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:06,200
I beg of you. I can't do
this work. I can never do this.

941
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:07,400
You will definitely do this.

942
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:09,200
Otherwise these photographs..
- No, no.

943
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,000
Don't post these photographs,
for God's sake.

944
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:12,800
Please don't post them.

945
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,800
I'll do as you say.
I'll definitely do that..

946
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:17,800
How will I do it?

947
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,400
If my real father comes to
know about this entire matter..

948
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,000
.. neither can I become the
brigadier's son-in-law..

949
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:24,600
..nor your secret scheme
will succeed.

950
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:25,800
The entire plan will flop.
Finished.

951
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:29,600
It is not a joke.

952
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,000
Don't worry about it.

953
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:33,800
We will take care of your father.

954
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,600
Hail God. What's happening?

955
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,800
There is no news of
anyone's death in the newspaper.

956
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:42,600
What will happen to the
population of this country?

957
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,800
Everyone you see is
going on being alive.

958
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,400
No one dies at all.

959
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:49,400
Hello, Mr. Kandharam.
Congratulations.

960
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,600
Congratulations? About what?

961
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:54,600
You have become the
brother-in-law of such a rich man..

962
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:55,800
..and you are asking me instead?

963
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:57,400
What are you saying, Rastogi?

964
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:58,600
Have you gone crazy?

965
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,400
Crazy? Am I crazy? I find you crazy.

966
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:03,800
Your son is getting married there..

967
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,600
..and here you've opened
your shop selling funeral items?

968
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:07,800
Vijay's wedding?

969
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,400
Yes. Look at the wedding card.

970
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,600
Am I lying to you?

971
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:15,000
It is clearly written in it
that your son Vijay's wedding..

972
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,600
..is being solemnized with
brigadier's daughter Roma..

973
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:20,400
..at Hotel Parklane.

974
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:22,000
I am going there.

975
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:29,000
Don't call me Kandharam
if I don't ruin this wedding party.

976
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:31,000
Inspector Giri Haridhara.

977
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,600
Yes, Inspector Hari Haridhara.

978
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,600
He has come to know
about the wedding.

979
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:38,000
Yes. Our entire plan can flop.
- Yes.

980
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:41,600
Hey? What's up?

981
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:48,400
What happened?

982
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:57,800
Hey, is it Dara Singh's gymnasium?

983
00:55:58,400 --> 00:55:59,800
How much for this bamboo?

984
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:01,600
The shop is closed today.

985
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:04,400
We don't want the shop,
but the bamboo.

986
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:07,400
Will you go or shall I thrash you?
Get lost.

987
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:12,400
Run!

988
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:13,400
What will we do now?

989
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,600
Come on.
- Lock it.

990
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:22,800
Now let's see where he runs.
- Quiet.

991
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:34,600
Didn't you hear that
the shop is closed today?

992
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:35,800
Quite.

993
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:38,600
Quiet.
- Quiet.

994
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:40,000
They are mad.

995
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:42,600
Idiot.

996
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:53,400
Vijay and Roma.

997
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,000
This wedding won't take place.

998
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:09,400
Hello.

999
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,400
Country first.

1000
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:21,800
Oh, he has started doing
the 'Bhangra'.

1001
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:26,400
Oh, my God. Has my son
already got married?

1002
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,400
Wait, I am his father.

1003
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:31,400
He is not your father.
It is too much.

1004
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:32,600
I won't let this wedding take place.

1005
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:34,600
I will cancel this wedding.

1006
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:41,400
Help. Someone help me.

1007
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,200
Sir, you have fallen in water.

1008
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:47,000
Idiot, then has your
father fallen in it?

1009
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:48,400
Oh, I am very sorry, sir.

1010
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:49,800
Sir, have you come to
attend the wedding, too?

1011
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,600
Idiot, it is my son's wedding.

1012
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:53,200
Oh, sir, do one thing.
- Yes?

1013
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:55,000
You come to my room and
change your clothes.

1014
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:55,600
Okay.

1015
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:56,600
Do you have your room here?
- Yes, sir.

1016
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:58,200
Come on, take me there.
- Come on, sir.

1017
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:59,000
Yes. Hurry up.

1018
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:00,400
Listen.
- Yes, sir?

1019
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:01,400
Will you serve me a little brandy?
- Yes, sir.

1020
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:02,600
Very good. Pick me up.

1021
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:03,600
From this side, sir.
- Oh, yes.

1022
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:06,600
Sir, get it pressed and bring it quickly.
- Yes, sir.

1023
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:08,000
Otherwise the wedding
will take place. - Yes, sir.

1024
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,200
It will be better.

1025
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:13,000
Sorry, sir.
- Idiot.

1026
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:22,400
Sir.
- Yes?

1027
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:23,800
Sir, it is my tray.

1028
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:30,800
Sir.
- Idiot.

1029
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:35,400
No. Vijay first.

1030
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:48,200
Open it. Hurry up. Open it.

1031
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:51,800
What's wrong, sir?
- Get lost.

1032
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:52,800
Sir.

1033
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:54,400
Wretched fellow had
locked me inside.

1034
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:55,800
Where is the wedding taking place?
- In the garden, sir.

1035
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,400
Sir, this is our towel.

1036
00:58:58,600 --> 00:58:59,600
Shut up.

1037
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:03,400
Sir, the auspicious
hour is passing away.

1038
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:05,000
All right. I know. You go.

1039
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:10,800
Why hasn't he turned up yet?

1040
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:16,600
Son, listen.
- Yes?

1041
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,400
Why hasn't your father
turned up yet?

1042
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:19,800
He must be on his way.

1043
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:22,400
The auspicious hour of the
wedding is passing away.

1044
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:23,800
I'll do one thing.
I'll go and bring him.

1045
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:25,400
How will you go? You are the groom.

1046
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:27,400
He must be in the hotel
room and he is very stubborn.

1047
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:28,600
He won't come if I don't go.

1048
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:30,400
Yes. He will have to go.
- Yes.

1049
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Don't worry. I am here.
I'll handle it.

1050
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,200
What will you handle?
He is the groom.

1051
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:35,600
How will you manage?

1052
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:37,000
I have this gun.
- Oh, yes. You have this. You have this.

1053
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:37,800
So shall I go?

1054
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:38,800
You may go.
- Thanks.

1055
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:42,400
The brigadier wants to
meet my father.

1056
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:44,000
And your real father has come here.

1057
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:45,000
Oh, where is he?

1058
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:46,400
We have locked him in the room.

1059
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,400
Then it is time for me
to become my father.

1060
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,400
All right. We'll use formula 85.
- Okay.

1061
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:54,200
Sir, where were you?
You took so long.

1062
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,400
Actually I have to
face so many difficulties.

1063
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,200
I had to change my clothes
many times.

1064
00:59:58,600 --> 00:59:59,600
Change your clothes?

1065
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:01,800
I mean it is too hot in your country.
- Yes.

1066
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:03,800
So they get spoiled due to perspiration.
- All right.

1067
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:05,400
Okay, let's go.
- Yes, let's go.

1068
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:07,400
Please come. Hurry up.
- Please come. Let's go.

1069
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:08,800
Be careful. Take care.
- Let's go.

1070
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:10,800
Watch your steps on the carpet.
- Come on, Son.

1071
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,600
Go ahead. Go. Sit quietly. Okay?
- Yes, Daddy.

1072
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:15,800
Don't harass the bride.

1073
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:16,800
Why would he harass her?

1074
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,400
Wait.
- Oh, God.

1075
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:20,800
Wait. This wedding can't take place.

1076
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:24,200
You are trapping my
son by deceiving him?

1077
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:25,600
Hey, you have come again?
That, too, unclad?

1078
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:27,400
Get lost or I'll shoot you.

1079
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:29,600
Whether you shoot me or fire me..

1080
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,600
.. my son is getting married
and I should stay out?

1081
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:34,200
My name is Kandharam.

1082
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:36,600
Whether your name is
Kandharam or Nangaram..

1083
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:37,800
..get lost from here.

1084
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:38,800
Scram. Get lost.

1085
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,200
This is not your, but his son's wedding.
- Of course.

1086
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:43,400
His son's wedding?
- Yes.

1087
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:47,000
Oh, I've seen you before.

1088
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:48,600
Will you get lost or
shall I shoot you?

1089
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:52,400
Look, you always barge in unclad
and harass the people.

1090
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,600
Do one thing. See the
groom's face and decide..

1091
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:56,400
..whether he is your son or not.
That's it. - Right.

1092
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,200
You are right.
I'll take a look right away. - Yes.

1093
01:00:58,200 --> 01:00:59,800
How did this old man
come out of the room?

1094
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:05,000
Am I your son?
- No.

1095
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,800
Then why are you
needlessly creating this commotion?

1096
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Idiot.

1097
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,200
It is too much. How did it happen?

1098
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:14,000
This idiot is not my son.

1099
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:16,200
Are you satisfied now?
- Yes.

1100
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:17,800
Do you believe now that
he is not your son?

1101
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,800
Yes.
- Come on, get lost from here now..

1102
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,600
..otherwise I'll shoot
you at such a place..

1103
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:22,400
Where will you shoot me?

1104
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:25,200
That you will keep
clapping for a lifetime.

1105
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:27,000
Come on, get lost from here now.
- Have you seen my son?

1106
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Handle your towel.
- Shut up.

1107
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:31,000
He is crazy. A little silly.

1108
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:33,800
My son has to go somewhere.

1109
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Go somewhere? Leaving the
wedding incomplete? Right now?

1110
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:38,400
He has some urgent work.

1111
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:39,600
What's the problem, Son?

1112
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:44,400
Yes, it will be a bad omen if
he relieves himself here.

1113
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,200
Yes, you go. Go straight,
take a right turn..

1114
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:48,600
..then go on the
right on the left hand.

1115
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:49,600
Very simple.
- Yes.

1116
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:51,600
Come on, Vijay,
you shouldn't delay this work.

1117
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:56,400
We had a narrow escape.

1118
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:57,600
Remove the wedding suit
immediately..

1119
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:59,000
..the auspicious hour is passing away.
- Okay.

1120
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:03,000
Sir. Sir, this is our towel.
- Get lost.

1121
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,200
Sir. Sir, this is our towel.

1122
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:07,200
Sir. Sir.
- Your towel? Is it your father's?

1123
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:09,800
Sir.

1124
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Sir, you have taken
a very long time.

1125
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:12,000
Yes, come on, let's get married.
- We will get married?

1126
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:13,800
I mean solemnize our wedding.
Solemnize our wedding.

1127
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Yes. Come on, son, please sit.

1128
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:19,200
Come on.
- You sit, Son.

1129
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:20,600
Will the priest's mood get spoiled?

1130
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,800
Hurry up, Son, the
time is passing away.

1131
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,600
The priest must be fed up, too.

1132
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:26,600
How are you, priest?

1133
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:28,600
How are you?

1134
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:44,200
Madam, we are electricians.
There is a short circuit in your house.

1135
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:46,000
Yes, there is a danger of
your house catching fire.

1136
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,200
There is leakage at some place.

1137
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:49,600
I got an emergency phone call.
Did you call me?

1138
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:50,600
No, I didn't call you.

1139
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:52,400
You are very careless.
Your house will definitely catch fire.

1140
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:53,800
Oh, then you please check it.

1141
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,600
Okay. Inspector.

1142
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:57,600
Oh, how dumb!

1143
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Listen.

1144
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:01,600
Bijlani.
- Electrician.

1145
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:03,000
There is something wrong
in this room.

1146
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:06,600
I understood the moment I stepped in.

1147
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:09,400
There is electricity here, but
there is no power in it. It's sleeping.

1148
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:11,800
Hey. Why is your servant
sleeping on the bed?

1149
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:14,200
He is not my servant,
he is my husband.

1150
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:17,000
Oh, no, you married a servant?
- Shut up.

1151
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,200
You fool.
- What did you say?

1152
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:19,400
Not you, madam,
I am saying it to Bijlani.

1153
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:21,200
Please go and get
chilled water for us.

1154
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:23,000
Hey, you fool. I don't want water..

1155
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:24,200
..I want some tea.

1156
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:25,600
Oh, yes. Yes.
- Okay, I'll get it.

1157
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:30,000
How much sugar?
- Well.. Four spoons.

1158
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:33,600
Has she left?
- Yes.

1159
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,200
Hey, you are
sleeping here peacefully..

1160
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:38,600
..you have ruined our sleep.

1161
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:39,600
Come on, wake up.

1162
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:40,800
Hey. Wake up.

1163
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,200
This is not the right way.
We'll have to give him a shock.

1164
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:45,200
That, too, of 440 volts.

1165
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,400
My chance. My turn.
- Okay.

1166
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:56,800
Hey, what are you doing?

1167
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:00,600
Who is it?

1168
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,800
What are they doing here?
- He is an electrician.

1169
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:04,400
No they are not electricians.

1170
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:08,200
He is that.. useless one.. and
he is that scoundrel.. shameless..

1171
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:10,000
They.. They are the ones
who are after my life.

1172
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:11,400
Do electricians look like them?
- What are you saying?

1173
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:12,600
Look.. at him. He is
behaving so weird.

1174
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:13,800
Look. Look at him..
Look, he is dancing.

1175
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,400
See.. See, see. They are after me.

1176
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:17,800
They follow me everywhere.

1177
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:19,200
They are also after your daddy.

1178
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:20,600
They tell me to follow your daddy.

1179
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:22,600
To find out what your
daddy eats, what he drinks..

1180
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:24,800
..whom your daddy meets,
whom he doesn't meet..

1181
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,600
..where your daddy goes,
where he doesn't go..

1182
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:29,200
..whom he sleeps with,
whom he wakes up with..

1183
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:30,600
Hey, shut up.
- Where he..

1184
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:34,800
Bijlani.
- Yes, yes electrician.

1185
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,600
He's not in his senses.
- Yes.

1186
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:39,000
Exit.
- Exit.

1187
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:40,200
You fool.
- Yes.

1188
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:42,200
Not from there, from here.

1189
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:49,600
What are you doing?

1190
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:51,200
It's your birthday today,
so I am wishing you.

1191
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:53,200
Wish me after reaching
the picnic cottage, right?

1192
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:55,000
I'll wish you in such a
way at the picnic cottage..

1193
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:57,800
..that you won't
forget it for a long time.

1194
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,600
Look, Vijay, don't disturb me.

1195
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:00,800
Let me keep these clothes
in the bag.

1196
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,400
Roma, who will be
wearing so many clothes?

1197
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:04,600
Why? Won't we go out for an outing?

1198
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,200
Yes, we'll go out,
but only in the room.

1199
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:08,600
You wish me. Then I'll wish you.
- Okay.

1200
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:10,800
Then again you wish me
and I'll wish you again.

1201
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,600
And two days will get
over in wishing each other.

1202
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:13,400
They will get over.
- And by the way..

1203
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:15,000
..I have given your bag to Navratan.

1204
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:17,200
Oh, no. Navratan.

1205
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:20,600
Navratan cannot help us
in this situation.

1206
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:22,600
Please, Vijay.
- Please, Roma.

1207
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:27,600
Hello, yes, I have got the bag.
I'll bring it immediately.

1208
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:33,200
Deewan Hotel. Room no?
- 125.

1209
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:36,600
125.
I'll be right there soon.

1210
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,600
Why do they fix wheels on
a suitcase?

1211
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:40,200
There it goes off.

1212
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:46,800
Oh, no.

1213
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:49,200
I am feeling scared.
- Why?

1214
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:50,800
Whenever you become romantic..

1215
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:52,000
..something or the other goes wrong.

1216
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:53,200
Roma, I..

1217
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,800
Shall I keep this suitcase
in the car?

1218
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,600
Or would like to sit
and go on this?

1219
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:00,000
You.. You go away from here.
- Why?

1220
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:01,200
Go quickly. Go.

1221
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:02,400
Are you planning
the picnic over here itself?.

1222
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:03,600
Go.

1223
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:14,200
What is this, Vijay?

1224
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:15,800
This looks like a magical box.

1225
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,600
They turn into chocolates
if you keep clothes in it.

1226
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:19,800
No, Vijay, I am sure daddy
must have gifted this.

1227
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:21,800
He knows that I am
very fond of sweets.

1228
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,600
You are fond of them, but can I eat them?
- Yes.

1229
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:25,200
Thank you.

1230
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:38,000
There's something wrong.

1231
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:40,000
The chocolates are not good.

1232
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:05,400
"What did I take?"

1233
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:09,200
"What did you give me?"

1234
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,400
"What did you take?"

1235
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:16,000
"What did I give you?"

1236
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:23,000
"I am unaware,
so are you, my beloved."

1237
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:27,600
"God knows what happened. '

1238
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:31,400
"We are intoxicated."

1239
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:34,800
"God knows what happened."

1240
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:38,600
"We are intoxicated."

1241
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:06,600
"The world seems to be
upside down."

1242
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:13,600
"I haven't come across
such a scene."

1243
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:20,000
"Why am I feeling drowsy?"

1244
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:26,800
"I am feeling so romantic."

1245
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:33,800
"Take hold of me,
embrace me, my beloved."

1246
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:38,600
"God knows what happened."

1247
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:42,200
"We are intoxicated."

1248
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:45,600
"God knows what happened."

1249
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:49,600
"We are intoxicated."

1250
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:48,800
"My lips are burning and
my body needs your touch."

1251
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:55,800
"There is a sweet desire for you."

1252
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:02,600
"What is happening to me?"

1253
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:09,600
"I am crazy for you."

1254
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:16,200
"Your touch has made me
crazy for you, my beloved."

1255
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:21,200
"God knows what happened."

1256
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:24,800
"We are intoxicated."

1257
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:28,200
"God knows what happened."

1258
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:32,000
"We are intoxicated."

1259
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,200
"What did I take?"

1260
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:40,800
"What did you give me?"

1261
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,600
"What did you take?
- What did I take?"

1262
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:48,000
"What did I give you?"

1263
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:55,000
"I am unaware, so are you, my beloved."

1264
01:10:56,400 --> 01:11:00,000
"God knows what happened."

1265
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:03,400
"We are intoxicated."

1266
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:07,200
"God knows what happened."

1267
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:10,800
"We are intoxicated."

1268
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:16,400
"We are highly intoxicated."

1269
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:21,400
Sir, it's already very late.
Take your packet..

1270
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:23,000
..and give me mine.

1271
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:25,600
That's good. Number three?
- Yes, sir.

1272
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:27,200
Open the bag and count the cash.

1273
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:33,000
One loincloth. Night gown.
One dress.

1274
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:34,400
Brigadier.
- One banana.

1275
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:35,200
Am I going to wear all this?

1276
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:36,200
One sweet lime.

1277
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:38,200
Where are my drugged chocolates?

1278
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:40,200
I am also wondering the same.

1279
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:42,400
Where are the drugged chocolates?

1280
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:45,000
Think.
- No, I don't have a clue.

1281
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,200
You don't know.
- No, I don't.

1282
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:51,800
Boss number one and number
two are waiting for you.

1283
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:57,000
Attention. Boss
number one is arriving.

1284
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,800
Is arriving. Is arriving.

1285
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:33,000
Good evening, sir.
- Shut up.

1286
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:37,400
I had told you to get the
maps of the atomic plants..

1287
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:39,000
..and military positions..

1288
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:41,200
Why is the brigadier being
unable to give us the same?

1289
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:44,000
The brigadier wants to meet you
personally for that.

1290
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,400
Shut up.

1291
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:54,200
Shut up. No one has
dared to meet me till now.

1292
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
I'll tell him that you
don't want to meet him.

1293
01:12:57,200 --> 01:13:00,400
Shut up. I'll meet him.
I'll definitely meet him.

1294
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:02,200
I will meet him.
Will definitely meet him.

1295
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,800
And do tell him that if he..

1296
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:06,600
Idiot.

1297
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:10,600
..tries to act smart..

1298
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,600
..I'll give him such
a big shock that..

1299
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:17,000
..he'll be completely doomed.

1300
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:22,800
Isn't it good that I got
the tickets booked, Vijay?

1301
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,600
If I had relied on you,
it wouldn't be possible at all.

1302
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:26,600
When will your Navratan
come to our use then?

1303
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:29,800
Vijay, this flower is so nice.
I want it.

1304
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,600
No, no, this garden belongs
to that crazy Mr. Pestonji.

1305
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:33,400
He'll leave his dogs after us
if he sees us plucking the flower.

1306
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:35,200
Please, Vijay,
pluck that flower for me.

1307
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:39,000
Roma, that.. Okay, do one thing.
You go and hide over there.

1308
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:40,200
Yes. Alright.
- But hide properly.

1309
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:42,800
I'll pluck it quickly.
Quietly, alright.

1310
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:44,200
Come quickly.

1311
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,400
Oh, God. What are you both
doing here in this get-up?

1312
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:50,200
This flower was planted by us.

1313
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:51,600
We had planted this flower.

1314
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:53,200
Come along with us, there is
some very urgent work for you.

1315
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:54,000
There is nothing urgent.

1316
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,200
Right now, I am with my wife and
we are going to watch a movie.

1317
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:58,000
You want to watch a movie? Look at this.
- Yes.

1318
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:00,400
Oh, no. From where did you get this?

1319
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:01,600
If you don't come with us,
we'll paste the enlargements..

1320
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:04,400
..of these pictures all over the town.

1321
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
What a mess! Come on, come.

1322
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Vijay. Vijay.
Where has he disappeared?

1323
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:17,000
Why did you bring me here
in the centre of the road?

1324
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:17,800
Do you want to kill me?

1325
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,400
We have a master plan in our mind.

1326
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:22,200
Listen, the brigadier's car
will come from there now..

1327
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:24,200
..we'll stop the car and
you sit in the car's dickey..

1328
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:25,800
..waiting on the road and follow
the brigadier. Do you understand?

1329
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,000
By sitting in the dickey?
- Yes.

1330
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:28,200
But how will you stop the car?

1331
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:34,400
Yes. The car has come.

1332
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:39,800
Stop. Stop the taxi. Stop.

1333
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:43,600
Hey, move.
- Please listen to me.

1334
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:45,400
Please help the blind.

1335
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:47,000
What happened, mister?

1336
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:50,600
My wife ran away with all
the belongings from the house..

1337
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:52,400
..with our neighbor.

1338
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:53,800
Oh, no.
- Come on, move. Move, mister. Move.

1339
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:57,400
Don't say this, mister.
Don't be so heartless.

1340
01:14:57,400 --> 01:15:00,400
Instead of helping him,
you are abusing him.

1341
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:01,600
Come on, tell me. Tell me further.

1342
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:06,000
I have six kids. Two ran away
to Mumbai to became actors.

1343
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:09,000
See? This man is
in such deep trouble.

1344
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:12,800
And I have four young
daughters in the house.

1345
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
Four.
- Four.

1346
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:18,000
We also have four young
boys in the house, right?

1347
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:20,000
Okay, are they educated?
- Yes, yes.

1348
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:22,400
Are they married?
- No.

1349
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:24,000
So their alliance is fixed with them.

1350
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,200
Idiots.

1351
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:27,600
Yes, it's a deal, mister.

1352
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:30,000
I'll take another taxi.

1353
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:32,400
Go, go.. Go.

1354
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:34,000
Hey, he is going.

1355
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:35,800
Hey, the bird is flying away.

1356
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,800
Which bird? The bird is flying away.
- What happened?

1357
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:39,400
Inspector.

1358
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:41,200
There. Stupid.

1359
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:46,400
Baba.. black sheep have
you any wool?

1360
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:48,200
Move on. Move on.

1361
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:49,400
Take me there.

1362
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:50,800
Okay.
- Hey, stop the car.

1363
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:53,000
Stop the car. Don't move at all.

1364
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:54,200
Stop the car over there.

1365
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Stop the car. Stop the car.

1366
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:58,400
Constable, can't you see
I have stopped the car?

1367
01:15:58,600 --> 01:15:59,800
Yes.
- What's the matter?

1368
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,200
There is a road block.
Get down. Get down.

1369
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:04,200
Get down. What's your name?

1370
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:06,400
What is your name?
- Ibrahim Khan.

1371
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:09,000
Ibrahim. Sir, he is a smuggler.
He is a smuggler, sir.

1372
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,200
Are you a smuggler?
- No, I am a film producer.

1373
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,800
It's one and the same,
buddy. Both are cheaters.

1374
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:15,000
Open the bag.
- Sir, which film are you producing?

1375
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:17,000
Shut-up.
- The name is Shut-up.

1376
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:19,400
Who is the villain in that film?
What is the name of the heroine?

1377
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:20,800
There is nothing in it, sir.

1378
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,400
There are only clothes
and that, too, Indian.

1379
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:23,400
Okay, check the dickey.

1380
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:25,000
Hold him. I'll check the dickey.

1381
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:27,000
Why do you want to check the dickey?
It has my clothes in it.

1382
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,200
Sir, my clothes are
lying in the dickey.

1383
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:31,000
Sir. Sir, there is a dead body
in this like we see in the movies.

1384
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:32,800
Why do you scream all the time?
Why are you screaming?

1385
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,400
You. You pickpocket.
What were doing inside?

1386
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:36,800
Were you trying to steal the tyre?
- My fare?

1387
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Is there any rule that
anyone cannot sit in the dickey?

1388
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,400
But you can give me my fare.

1389
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:42,000
You shut-up.
You don't try to teach me law.

1390
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:43,000
Don't try to teach me law.

1391
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:44,200
Tell me frankly, what were
you doing in the dickey?

1392
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:46,400
What were you doing inside?
- I.. I.. I was sleeping.

1393
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:48,800
Oh, no. He's gone mad. Was sleeping.

1394
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,400
Sir, my fare.
- You keep quiet.

1395
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:51,400
You get down. Come out.

1396
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:57,000
My fare. Fare? My fare.
- Come out.

1397
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:01,400
Madam.
- Yes.

1398
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:02,400
Is he your husband?

1399
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:04,000
But where did you find him?

1400
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:07,000
Take care.
I found him in a car's dickey.

1401
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:08,000
In car's dickey.

1402
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:10,400
I think he's gone mad,
don't send him outside alone.

1403
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
I think all are mad in this house.

1404
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:17,000
You are definitely
going to another woman.

1405
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:18,600
If I was going around
with another woman..

1406
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:20,600
..wouldn't she be with me
in the dickey at that time?

1407
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,800
Then what were you
doing alone in the dickey?

1408
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:24,800
What can a man do alone
in the dickey?

1409
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:26,200
He can only sleep, right?
So I was sleeping.

1410
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:27,400
So you were sleeping?
- Yes.

1411
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:28,400
In the dickey?
- Yes.

1412
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:29,200
But why?

1413
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:31,400
Only time will tell this.

1414
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:33,000
You tell me.

1415
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:34,800
I can't tell you right now, Roma.

1416
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:37,800
If you can't tell me, then I'll tell you
when the right time comes.

1417
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,600
Okay, you'll tell me when
the right time comes, right?

1418
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:40,800
Do tell me, but let
me sleep right now.

1419
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,000
Okay, good night.

1420
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,400
Vijay.
- I am already asleep.

1421
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:50,600
Hello. Hi, Raja.
Why did you take so long?

1422
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,600
I was waiting for your
phone call since so long.

1423
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Look, I am ready since a long time.

1424
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:58,600
Where? Park Lane Hotel?

1425
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:01,200
How can I refuse when
you are inviting me.

1426
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:04,800
How sweet, Raja! Hey, naughty boy.

1427
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,600
I'll give you one.

1428
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:09,400
Okay, fine, you don't go.
I'll be there soon.

1429
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,800
Okay, okay, fine.
I'll come there soon.

1430
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,400
Okay? Okay, bye-bye.

1431
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:19,200
Hello. Hello. Hello. Hey.
Hey, Mr. Raja.

1432
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:21,000
Raja. Raja. Hey. Hey. Hello. Hello.

1433
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,200
Hey, hey, hello.

1434
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:23,600
I'll get a raid done
in the Park Lane Hotel.

1435
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,400
What is this? What is this?

1436
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:28,200
Hey, what's going on?

1437
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:31,400
We are exchanging telephones, sir.

1438
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:37,000
Hell. Hello, complaint.

1439
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:39,800
Yes, this thing has broken. This..

1440
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:44,800
Chase.
- Whom?

1441
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:45,600
Wife.

1442
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:46,600
But my wife is at home.

1443
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:48,600
You fool, chase my wife.
Hurry up, she is going.

1444
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:49,800
Come on.

1445
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,600
Oh, Raja. I can't live without you.

1446
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:01,400
I can't break the
sacred bond between us.

1447
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:03,600
But can you leave your husband?

1448
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:06,400
Don't take his name in front of me.
I hate him.

1449
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:10,200
He didn't give me anything
which a husband gives his wife.

1450
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:12,200
I'll give you everything.

1451
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:13,600
Is it so?
- Yes.

1452
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:16,600
Then we'll go to such a place
where there's only you, me and..

1453
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:17,800
Thrill.

1454
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:23,800
Get up. You scoundrel.
You'll give everything to my wife?

1455
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:25,400
Are you a wholesale trader?

1456
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:27,000
I haven't done anything.
- Shut-up.

1457
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:29,000
I'll come back and give
your share of thrills soon.

1458
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,400
Where has that wholesale
trader gone?

1459
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,600
Mister, don't hit me on my face..

1460
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:35,200
..I earn because of my face.
I work at the Prithvi Theatre.

1461
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:37,800
Hit me wherever you want,
but don't hit on my face.

1462
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,600
You can take this money,
your wife had given me..

1463
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:41,000
.. Rs. 200 to do this drama.

1464
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,600
This is just a drama.
- You were doing a drama with my wife.

1465
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:48,200
The drama which you were doing..

1466
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:49,200
..continue it for another 15 minutes.

1467
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:50,600
Take these Rs. 200. No, keep Rs. 100.

1468
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:53,600
If you touch here,
I won't spare your face. Do you follow?

1469
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:01,200
Come, my dear,
today we both will go to a place..

1470
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:03,200
..where there is no
one except the two of us.

1471
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:04,200
Raja. Leave my hand.

1472
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:05,400
I won't leave at all.
Your husband has given me..

1473
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:07,600
..the green signal now.

1474
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:08,400
What do you mean?

1475
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:10,400
I mean to say that your
husband has told me that..

1476
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:12,800
..I can spend another 10
to 15 minutes with you.

1477
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,600
You can?
- Yes.

1478
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:20,000
Wonderful. Excellent.

1479
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:23,000
Number one has told me
to give you the good news.

1480
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:25,000
Which good news?

1481
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:28,600
Number one will meet you very soon.

1482
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:31,600
Me, too. Me, too. Me, too.

1483
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:34,600
There is a possibility
that this will be your..

1484
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:37,400
..first and last
meeting with number one.

1485
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:42,800
Last? I also wish the same. It
will definitely be like this.

1486
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:44,400
The cat salutes the dog.

1487
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:00,200
Hello, sir.

1488
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:06,600
Listen. Listen.
Did you notice a fat man..

1489
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:08,400
..wearing black
clothes going upstairs?

1490
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:09,800
There are many rooms over here..

1491
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:12,000
.. he may have entered any of the rooms.
- I.. I.. I have understood.

1492
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:16,000
Now tell me, take this.
- 328.

1493
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:17,000
328. Thank you.

1494
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:33,000
Hey, film actress Kalpana Iyer
has fled from her shooting..

1495
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:35,600
..and has come here.
Do you know which room she is in?

1496
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,400
Sir, 328.
- Okay.

1497
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:43,800
Who are you?

1498
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,800
Hey. Kalpana the film star.

1499
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:48,000
Are you leaving from here or not?
Or else I'll call the police.

1500
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:51,000
No, no, no, Ms. Kalpana, I..
I am looking out for someone.

1501
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:52,400
I don't want to hear anything.
You may please..

1502
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:54,600
Open the door. Open the door.

1503
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:56,200
Police.

1504
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:57,400
Oh, my.
- I.. I.. am leaving, Ms. Kalpana.

1505
01:21:57,400 --> 01:21:58,800
Why did you call the police?
- No, no, no, you don't leave.

1506
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:01,200
The police have not come for you,
they have come for me.

1507
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:02,400
The police have come
looking for you. Why?

1508
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:03,600
I have fled from the shooting.

1509
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:06,000
That director wants me to shoot
a scene in this type of clothes.

1510
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:08,000
And I don't want to wear
such clothes in a film.

1511
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:09,000
Absolutely right. You are right.

1512
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,800
You shouldn't wear such
kind of clothes in films.

1513
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:12,600
You.. You don't worry. I will
try to.. I mean to say that..

1514
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:14,800
..I'll try to see that
your image is not tarnished.

1515
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:18,400
I'll deal with the policeman.
You go and hide.

1516
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:20,800
Who is it?
- Police.

1517
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:22,400
Yes, I can see that. I can see it.

1518
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:23,600
Kalpana Iyer the actress
has fled from her shooting..

1519
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:24,600
..and she is hiding over here.

1520
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,200
I have got the information
that she is in this room.

1521
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:27,400
Me and my wife are in this room..

1522
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:28,600
..and we both are
here for our honeymoon.

1523
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:29,800
Are you leaving or shall
I call the police now?

1524
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:31,800
Sorry, sir.
- It's alright.

1525
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:34,600
You come here unnecessarily
to trouble a gentleman.

1526
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:36,200
He left?
- I went away.

1527
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:37,200
Thank you.

1528
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:40,600
Listen, did you see
any gentleman here?

1529
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:41,800
He is wearing a chequered coat.

1530
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:42,800
A chequered coat.
- Yes.

1531
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,400
Yes, everybody is going
to room no. 328 today.

1532
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,800
In 328?
- Madam.

1533
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:51,800
Vijay.
- Oh, my wife.

1534
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,200
Vijay, I am warning you.
Open the door.

1535
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:55,800
My wife. Ms. Kalpana, look,
I have saved you.

1536
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:57,400
Now you have to save my life.
- I'll not spare you today.

1537
01:22:57,400 --> 01:22:58,800
She is completely insane.
She'll kill me.

1538
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:00,200
Vijay.
- Please hide me somewhere.

1539
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:01,400
What can I do?
- Vijay.

1540
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:02,800
Here? No, not here.
- No, no. Cupboard.

1541
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:04,000
Cupboard. Yes.
- Yes.

1542
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:06,400
Ms. Kalpana. Please handle the situation.
- Vijay.

1543
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:08,200
She is completely insane.
She'll kill me.

1544
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:16,400
What are you doing here?

1545
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:19,000
I.. I.. I'm here just like that,
but what are you doing here?

1546
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:20,800
I have also come here
for no reason as such.

1547
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:23,000
Hey, listen. Listen.

1548
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:26,200
Where is my husband? You scoundrel.
You have hid him.

1549
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:27,600
I'll not spare him today.

1550
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:30,000
Your husband?
Yes, he is in the bathroom.

1551
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,200
Shut-up. - No, really,
he is in the bathroom. Please come.

1552
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:33,400
Come. Come.
- Where is he?

1553
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:34,600
He is in the bathroom.

1554
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:39,200
Can't an AC be installed in here?

1555
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:43,800
Listen, I have locked
your wife in the bathroom..

1556
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:45,000
..you can leave now.

1557
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:50,000
Hey, Ms. Kalpana,
what's wrong with her?

1558
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:51,200
Hey, what are you doing?

1559
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:53,000
Get up. Get up, Ms. Kalpana.

1560
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,200
Open the door.
- Get up, Ms. Kalpana.

1561
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:55,200
Open the door.

1562
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:57,200
Get up, Ms. Kalpana,
my hand is stuck under you.

1563
01:23:57,400 --> 01:23:59,800
Ms. Kalpana. Get up,
Ms. Kalpana. Get up.

1564
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,600
Get up, Get up, my hand..

1565
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:02,600
Get up. Get up.

1566
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:04,000
So this is your family tradition?

1567
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:05,400
No, no, this is not
my family tradition.

1568
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:06,800
Look, I'll try to
explain everything to you..

1569
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:07,800
..don't do anything
with that bottle.

1570
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:09,000
Look, I'll tell you everything.

1571
01:24:09,200 --> 01:24:10,400
Wait, my hand is stuck here.
Please free my hand.

1572
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:12,200
Look, I'm your husband.
First try to release my hand.

1573
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:15,400
Look, when I first
came into this room..

1574
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:16,600
..your daddy was
already in this cupboard.

1575
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:18,000
My daddy?
- Yes.

1576
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:19,000
In this cupboard?
- Yes.

1577
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:20,000
How can he come here?

1578
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,400
How?
- Wait, I'll show you.

1579
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:22,800
Come here, come. Look, I'll
show you how he came in here.

1580
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:24,000
Just come, I'll show you.

1581
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,800
Yes, wait, don't do
anything with the bottle.

1582
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,200
Look, I'll demonstrate. When I..

1583
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:28,600
You stay in..

1584
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:30,600
Where are you fleeing?

1585
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:33,200
Come home, I will not spare you.

1586
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:56,600
"Help."

1587
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:07,200
"Which has never happened
till now will happen now."

1588
01:25:07,400 --> 01:25:10,200
"What if I die?"

1589
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:13,600
"That's the reason I'm saying,
I'm saying, I'm saying.."

1590
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:17,600
"..don't shoot me. Don't shoot me."

1591
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:22,400
"Don't kill me. Don't kill me."

1592
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:31,600
"Which has never happened
till now, will happen now."

1593
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:33,800
"What if I die?"

1594
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:36,600
"That's the reason I'm saying,
I'm saying, I'm saying.."

1595
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:41,000
"..don't shoot me. Don't shoot me."

1596
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:45,600
"Don't kill me. Don't kill me."

1597
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:22,200
"There will be a big
chaos in the city if I die."

1598
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:33,200
"There will be a big
chaos in the city if I die."

1599
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:37,400
"There will be news about my story.."

1600
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:41,400
"..in the newspapers.
- So what?"

1601
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:48,400
"My daddy will go to the police
station to file a complaint."

1602
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:53,000
"There will be
a murder case on you."

1603
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:57,000
"Nobody will be your witness."

1604
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:00,800
"You will be given
a death sentence."

1605
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:04,600
"I'll die, but you'll die as well."

1606
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:07,800
"That's the reason I'm saying,
I'm saying, I'm saying.."

1607
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:11,800
"..don't shoot me. Don't shoot me."

1608
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:16,400
"Don't kill me. Don't kill me."

1609
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:54,600
"Believe me, my beloved,
there is no other woman in my life."

1610
01:27:54,600 --> 01:28:02,400
"You are unaware of my helplessness.
- Go. Go away."

1611
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:09,600
"I have been trapped,
don't think that I'm betraying you."

1612
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:18,200
"If you allow me,
I'm ready to disclose everything."

1613
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:23,800
"When you come to know the truth.."

1614
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:25,600
"..maybe you'll believe me then."

1615
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:28,800
"That's the reason I'm saying,
I'm saying, I'm saying.."

1616
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:33,000
"..don't shoot me. Don't shoot me."

1617
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:37,600
"Don't kill me. Don't kill me."

1618
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:12,000
"Two buffoons are after my life."

1619
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:23,400
"Two buffoons are after my life."

1620
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:30,800
"I know that they are
your daddy's enemies."

1621
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:35,800
"They called me and threatened me.."

1622
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:40,600
"..and told me to chase."
- "What?"

1623
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:42,800
"Chase.
- Shut up."

1624
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:50,200
"That's the reason after
that fatso I'm all the time."

1625
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:54,800
"I'm unaware, but
they know everything.."

1626
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:58,600
"..about your daddy's activities."

1627
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:01,800
"You tell me, what am
I supposed to do now?"

1628
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:06,400
"Or else kill me."

1629
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:10,600
"Kill me. Yes, yes, kill me. '

1630
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:14,800
If you had told me
everything earlier..

1631
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:16,000
..this situation
wouldn't have arisen.

1632
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,800
How could I tell you, Roma?
They had threatened me.

1633
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:20,400
God knows what both the
buffoons might have done.

1634
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:21,400
There is a possibility that your
life would have been in danger.

1635
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:23,200
Okay, we still have time
in our hands.

1636
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:25,600
I'll give you something,
you go and give it to them.

1637
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:26,600
What?
- Listen.

1638
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:31,400
What if anything goes wrong, Roma?

1639
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:32,800
Look, nothing will happen.

1640
01:30:33,200 --> 01:30:35,400
They will be out of
our way for 2-3 months.

1641
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:37,600
They both will out of
our way for 2-3 months.

1642
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:39,000
Then we will go for
a honeymoon from..

1643
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:40,400
.. Kashmir to
Kanyakumari for 2-3 months.

1644
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,400
You don't like Kanyakumari?

1645
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:46,600
Inspector, Harihari Dhara.

1646
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:48,600
Yes.
- What is the time?

1647
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:49,200
11:30.

1648
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:50,800
Why hasn't agent
Vijay arrived till now?

1649
01:30:57,400 --> 01:30:59,200
You fool.
- Sorry.

1650
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:01,000
Vijay, you were going to get
some evidence..

1651
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:02,000
..against the brigadier, right?

1652
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
Yes, yes, this box
contains that big evidence.

1653
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,400
You'll be delighted
after seeing that evidence.

1654
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:09,000
Are you telling the truth?

1655
01:31:09,200 --> 01:31:10,400
Yes, you will be glad.

1656
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:11,800
In fact, they won't
feel the need to work..

1657
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,200
..for another two to three
months after watching this.

1658
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:17,000
Oh, you naughty boy.
- Oh, so sweet.

1659
01:31:17,200 --> 01:31:19,200
We are proud of you.
- Country first.

1660
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:21,200
The country is proud of you.

1661
01:31:21,200 --> 01:31:22,200
Thanks a lot. Thanks.
- Shall I open and see it?

1662
01:31:22,200 --> 01:31:23,600
No. No. See it after I leave.

1663
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:25,400
To be frank, I would have
relieved you much earlier..

1664
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:26,600
.. if I had got this evidence before.

1665
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:28,600
I mean to say,
I would have convinced you.

1666
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:30,400
Sir, better late than never.

1667
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:33,000
Thank you.
- Carry it carefully and best of luck.

1668
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:34,200
Thank you.
- Bye, bye, bye.

1669
01:31:34,200 --> 01:31:35,600
Good bye.
- Bye, bye, bye. - Thank you.

1670
01:31:35,800 --> 01:31:38,400
You fool, what was the need
to open it in front of him?

1671
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:39,600
Let's go there.

1672
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:47,400
What is this?
- This is a bomb.

1673
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:49,400
Bomb. Then why is it not exploding?

1674
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:52,800
When the blue wire gets
connected with the red wire..

1675
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:54,000
..only then the bomb explodes.

1676
01:31:54,200 --> 01:31:54,800
How?

1677
01:31:55,200 --> 01:31:57,000
You fool, I have to show
you such a simple way.

1678
01:31:57,600 --> 01:31:58,000
This way.

1679
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:08,200
You fool.

1680
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:10,200
Vijay, you over here?

1681
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:12,000
I have come to
enquire about your health.

1682
01:32:12,200 --> 01:32:13,000
Are you okay?

1683
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
Yes, yes, we are fine.

1684
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:17,600
Why? Don't you want
to chase anyone?

1685
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:19,400
Do you remember? You used
to tell me all the time..

1686
01:32:19,400 --> 01:32:20,600
..to follow. Follow.

1687
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:21,800
To follow my dad, my father-in-law..

1688
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:22,800
..do this and do that. Why?

1689
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,400
Even on my honeymoon night..

1690
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,800
..on my first night, I had to follow.

1691
01:32:31,800 --> 01:32:32,800
Shut up.

1692
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,800
I'm in this situation due to
you and that's the reason..

1693
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:37,800
..I have exacted revenge from you.

1694
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,600
No, no, Vijay. This is the last
chance to arrest the brigadier.

1695
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:42,000
Keep quiet. Shut up.

1696
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:47,600
Despite having a wife, you both
forced me for a family planning.

1697
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:50,400
But now we'll not chase anyone.

1698
01:32:50,600 --> 01:32:52,600
I'm least bothered if my
father-in-law goes six feet under.

1699
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:54,600
Now we both are going
for a honeymoon.

1700
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:56,400
We'll start from Kashmir and then..

1701
01:32:56,800 --> 01:32:58,400
..we'll roam around
the whole world.

1702
01:32:58,600 --> 01:33:03,000
You fool, your father-in-law
is selling our country.

1703
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:06,400
Yes, then you can go abroad
for your honeymoon, right?

1704
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:08,600
Can't you keep quiet? Shut up.

1705
01:33:09,800 --> 01:33:13,400
I don't want to listen to you.
Neither you nor him. Yes.

1706
01:33:19,400 --> 01:33:20,600
Yes.

1707
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:24,000
Inspector Giridhari Hara.
- Yes, inspector Harihari Dhara.

1708
01:33:26,600 --> 01:33:28,000
Can you hear something?
- What?

1709
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:31,800
Our country is calling us.

1710
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:40,400
Attention. The king of
honeymoon is arriving.

1711
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:41,600
What are you doing?

1712
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,600
I had watched a movie.
'The Sour grapes of the King'.

1713
01:33:45,200 --> 01:33:46,800
There was a king eating sour
grapes like this in that movie..

1714
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,200
..and was celebrating his honeymoon.

1715
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:52,800
So I also thought that why
not we eat some sour grapes..

1716
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:56,200
..and do a small rehearsal
for our honeymoon as well?

1717
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:58,800
Look, Vijay,
don't try to be very romantic.

1718
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:00,200
Because when you are
being very romantic..

1719
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:01,400
..all are plans go haywire.

1720
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:03,200
Something or the other comes
up and everything is left out.

1721
01:34:03,400 --> 01:34:05,000
That's why I have planned
everything so well this time..

1722
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:06,200
..that nothing will go wrong.
- What?

1723
01:34:06,200 --> 01:34:09,000
Yes. No, no, I mean to say
that nothing wrong will happen..

1724
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:10,800
..and our honeymoon
will be successful.

1725
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:12,600
So before doing a lot over there..

1726
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:14,000
..shall we do
a little bit over here?

1727
01:34:14,200 --> 01:34:17,000
Look, Vijay, don't trouble me.
Let me do the packing.

1728
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:18,600
And go and get that.

1729
01:34:18,600 --> 01:34:19,200
What shall I get?

1730
01:34:19,400 --> 01:34:20,800
My shoes.

1731
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:26,000
What? Boss number
one wants to meet me?

1732
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:28,600
I was waiting so eagerly
for this day.

1733
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:30,400
Yes, I'll definitely come there.

1734
01:34:31,200 --> 01:34:34,400
Yes, yes.
I have understood the address.

1735
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:36,200
I'll come to the secret den.

1736
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:39,600
Take out the finger from your ears.

1737
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:42,800
What? - Take out the finger
from your ears.

1738
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:45,200
Who is it?
- Your integrity.

1739
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:48,800
Who?
- Your conscience, integrity. Soul.

1740
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:51,000
Where you were till now, buddy?

1741
01:34:51,200 --> 01:34:53,000
And why have you popped
up today all of a sudden?

1742
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:54,600
Since when have you become
so ignorant and untrustworthy?

1743
01:34:55,200 --> 01:34:57,400
You are meeting me
for the first time..

1744
01:34:57,400 --> 01:34:58,600
..and you have started accusing me?

1745
01:34:58,600 --> 01:34:59,800
Tell me clearly what
you want to say and..

1746
01:34:59,800 --> 01:35:00,800
..tell me in a better way.

1747
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:01,800
And get lost after saying it.
Do you understand?

1748
01:35:01,800 --> 01:35:04,600
You fool, you are
there because of me.

1749
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:06,400
Okay?
- Cool down and think.

1750
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:08,800
Is honeymoon the
ultimate motive in this world?

1751
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:11,600
Though it's not the ultimate one,
but it has its own importance.

1752
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:13,000
And I have not received
even a little bit of that.

1753
01:35:13,200 --> 01:35:14,400
That's why you are going
to Kashmir?

1754
01:35:14,600 --> 01:35:16,800
Yes, I am going.
I don't fear anyone.

1755
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:19,000
You have decided
about going to Kashmir.

1756
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:21,800
When will you think
about this great country?

1757
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:23,200
What do you mean?

1758
01:35:23,200 --> 01:35:24,200
I mean to say that..

1759
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:25,200
..your father-in-law has
left the house right now.

1760
01:35:25,400 --> 01:35:26,600
Are you not aware about it?

1761
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:28,600
If you are a true patriot..

1762
01:35:28,600 --> 01:35:29,800
..then follow him.

1763
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:32,800
If the country is spared,
only then Kashmir will be spared.

1764
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:34,200
And if you are able
to save Kashmir..

1765
01:35:34,200 --> 01:35:35,800
..you'll be able to celebrate
many such more honeymoons.

1766
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:37,200
Go, follow him.

1767
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:40,000
Follow him. You are under
the oath of your motherland.

1768
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:42,000
You are under the
oath of Ben Kingsley..

1769
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,200
..I mean Mahatma Gandhi.
Follow him.

1770
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:47,200
My dear integrity, you
have shown me the right path.

1771
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:49,600
I have to save the country.
I have to save the country.

1772
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:51,000
Forget the honeymoon,
the country comes first.

1773
01:35:51,200 --> 01:35:53,800
Well done. Very good,
I expected this from you.

1774
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:55,600
Thank you.
- You are always welcome.

1775
01:35:58,600 --> 01:36:01,200
I'll follow him. I'll follow him.

1776
01:36:01,200 --> 01:36:02,000
Whom are you going to follow?

1777
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,400
That fatso.

1778
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:05,400
I am under the oath.
- Who has put you under the oath?

1779
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:07,200
My integrity.
- What?

1780
01:36:07,400 --> 01:36:09,200
My country.
- What?

1781
01:36:09,200 --> 01:36:11,800
Mahatma Gandhi. I'll follow him.

1782
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:13,000
Vijay.
- I'll follow him.

1783
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:14,200
Listen to me, Vijay.

1784
01:36:18,200 --> 01:36:20,000
What, sir? Shall I chase?
- Of course.

1785
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:22,200
Yes, now begins the fun.

1786
01:36:24,600 --> 01:36:26,400
"Keep following. Keep following."

1787
01:36:27,400 --> 01:36:29,600
"Keep following. Keep following."

1788
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:36,800
"Keep following. Keep following."

1789
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:01,000
"Though you are with the enemies.."

1790
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,600
"..whether you win or lose."

1791
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:07,000
"Though you are with the enemies.."

1792
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,400
"..whether you win or lose."

1793
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:13,600
Wow. Great. Excellent. Great. Wow.

1794
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:15,200
So did you like the place?

1795
01:37:15,200 --> 01:37:16,800
Hopeless.
- Hopeless?

1796
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:18,200
Hopeless.
- What?

1797
01:37:18,200 --> 01:37:19,400
Those are nonsensical who say that..

1798
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:21,400
..they didn't like the place.
- Alright.

1799
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:24,600
This is not a place, you fool.
It's a very special place.

1800
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:25,800
Special place.

1801
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,400
But you are not allowed
to praise a lot over here.

1802
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:30,600
Why?

1803
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:33,600
The whole world knows that
there's not a better secret den..

1804
01:37:33,800 --> 01:37:35,400
..then this place
in the whole world.

1805
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:39,200
The whole world knows it?
- Yes. The whole world knows it.

1806
01:37:39,400 --> 01:37:40,800
You fool.
- Fool?

1807
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:42,200
Foolish.
- Who?

1808
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:44,800
Those who don't know
this place are fools.

1809
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:47,000
That's better. That's better.

1810
01:37:47,200 --> 01:37:49,200
When will be able to
meet number one?

1811
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:50,600
Sshh!

1812
01:37:55,400 --> 01:37:58,200
"Whether it's hot or
whether it's raining.."

1813
01:37:58,400 --> 01:38:00,800
"Whether it's day or night."

1814
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:04,000
"Whether it's hot or
whether it's raining.."

1815
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,800
"Whether it's day or night."

1816
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:14,000
"No one can escape from here."

1817
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:19,400
"Keep following. Keep following."

1818
01:38:19,400 --> 01:38:22,400
Boss number one is arriving.
The countdown begins.

1819
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:26,200
Three, four, five.
- Number one.

1820
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:27,400
No.

1821
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:31,600
Five, six, seven, eight.
- Number one?

1822
01:38:31,800 --> 01:38:33,000
No.

1823
01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:36,400
Eight, nine, two, eleven.

1824
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:40,800
Boss number one is arriving.

1825
01:38:42,600 --> 01:38:43,800
Boss number one?

1826
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:54,800
Meet the brigadier.

1827
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:00,400
The dog salutes the cat.

1828
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:02,200
I'm glad to meet you
because you are one of the best..

1829
01:39:02,200 --> 01:39:04,400
..traitors and
betrayers of your country.

1830
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:07,400
Don't say this, you
are far above all of us.

1831
01:39:09,200 --> 01:39:11,800
Great, I like your sense of humor.

1832
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:14,400
Come on, let's get
back to business.

1833
01:39:14,600 --> 01:39:15,600
Yes, come on.

1834
01:39:19,400 --> 01:39:21,400
Why? Where has sir disappeared?

1835
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:24,000
Let him get lost. No one is
bothered about me in this house.

1836
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:25,800
All have gone mad.
You have also gone mad.

1837
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:27,000
I'll also go insane.

1838
01:39:28,200 --> 01:39:32,000
The ghost does not come
closer to you.

1839
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,400
What are you doing, Navratan?
You are useless.

1840
01:39:34,600 --> 01:39:35,800
It doesn't come closer to you.

1841
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:40,800
Who are you?
- Where is Vijay?

1842
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:41,400
Who are you?

1843
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:43,200
Lady, your husband..
I mean to say that scoundrel..

1844
01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:45,200
..came to the hospital
and he hurt our wounds.

1845
01:39:45,400 --> 01:39:46,800
We'll not spare him today.

1846
01:39:47,200 --> 01:39:48,000
Shut up.
- Okay.

1847
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
Where is he?
- He's gone for a honeymoon.

1848
01:39:50,200 --> 01:39:51,800
Can a man go alone for the honeymoon?

1849
01:39:51,800 --> 01:39:53,600
No, but he can go on
the moon. Moon. Moon.

1850
01:39:53,800 --> 01:39:55,400
You fool, we don't want
the moon. We want Vijay.

1851
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:57,400
Where is Vijay?
- I don't know.

1852
01:39:57,400 --> 01:39:59,000
Lady, answer us or else this..
this injection..

1853
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:00,600
..will go across your heart.

1854
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:02,400
Madam, shall I call the police?

1855
01:40:02,600 --> 01:40:03,800
Inspector, tie up this man.

1856
01:40:03,800 --> 01:40:06,000
Yes, he can prove to be dangerous for us.
- Yes.

1857
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:06,800
Come on.

1858
01:40:20,400 --> 01:40:21,400
What is this?

1859
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,200
An ashtray.
- An ashtray?

1860
01:40:24,200 --> 01:40:26,600
I liked it very much. It's nice.
- This..

1861
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:30,400
This is not just an ashtray,
it's number two.

1862
01:40:31,200 --> 01:40:32,600
The one who came to
meet me before you.

1863
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:37,600
He tried to cheat me,
so we made an ashtray out of his head.

1864
01:40:37,800 --> 01:40:40,400
You mean to say that he was of
some use to you after he died.

1865
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:42,000
So that's why we want
that you should be of..

1866
01:40:42,200 --> 01:40:43,600
..some use to us as
long as you are alive.

1867
01:40:45,400 --> 01:40:46,800
Open it and show us.
- What?

1868
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:48,000
The head?

1869
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:53,200
No, the plans.
- Where is the cash..

1870
01:40:53,400 --> 01:40:56,200
..which you had promised to pay me?

1871
01:40:58,200 --> 01:40:59,000
Number two,

1872
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:08,000
I am trying to chase you from
the past so many days, brigadier.

1873
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:09,400
But you escaped every time.

1874
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:11,000
I had a doubt that you are a
big traitor and betrayer..

1875
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,600
..of our country, but now
I am completely convinced.

1876
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:15,600
Who is he? Who is he?

1877
01:41:15,800 --> 01:41:17,200
I don't know. I don't know.

1878
01:41:17,400 --> 01:41:18,800
Wait, I'll show you right now.

1879
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,200
Chang. Chang. Chang.

1880
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:16,400
I finally caught him, sir.

1881
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:19,200
Who is he?

1882
01:42:19,400 --> 01:42:21,200
How do I know? I am seeing him
for the first time in my life.

1883
01:42:21,800 --> 01:42:23,800
If you can't tell the truth,
at least don't lie.

1884
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,600
The truth can never be
hidden by a false truth.

1885
01:42:26,600 --> 01:42:28,000
Wow. Nice poem.

1886
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:29,200
It's a bad one.

1887
01:42:29,200 --> 01:42:31,000
Wow. So, young man,
do you know this donkey?

1888
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
I mean to say, do you know this
gentleman, this fearless man..

1889
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:34,400
..I mean do you know this brigadier?

1890
01:42:34,600 --> 01:42:36,600
Do I know him? I live in his house.

1891
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:38,800
He's mad. Mad. He's insane.

1892
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:40,000
Okay, so I am mad?
- Yes.

1893
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:41,800
Then why did you get your
daughter married to a mad person?

1894
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:43,800
Oh, so you are his son-in-law?

1895
01:42:43,800 --> 01:42:45,000
I am his son-in-law for sure.

1896
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:46,200
What do you say, brigadier?

1897
01:42:46,400 --> 01:42:48,600
Son-in-law.
I don't have any daughter.

1898
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:50,800
Oh, so is Roma your mother?

1899
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:52,200
Roma? Who is Roma?

1900
01:42:52,400 --> 01:42:53,600
My wife and his daughter.

1901
01:42:53,800 --> 01:42:54,800
What do you say, brigadier?

1902
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
No, no, no, sir, I am an orphan.

1903
01:42:57,200 --> 01:42:58,200
I have no one of my
own in this world..

1904
01:42:58,400 --> 01:42:59,800
..except you and what are you?

1905
01:43:00,600 --> 01:43:03,200
There are bells ringing in my head.

1906
01:43:03,400 --> 01:43:04,800
It must be a wrong number, sir.
Wrong number.

1907
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:05,800
It's possible.

1908
01:43:06,400 --> 01:43:07,600
Idea. Why don't we do this?

1909
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:11,200
That this orphan.. We better
call up at this orphan's house..

1910
01:43:11,200 --> 01:43:12,400
..and try to find out his heir.

1911
01:43:12,600 --> 01:43:14,000
Brilliant idea.
- Shut up.

1912
01:43:14,200 --> 01:43:15,400
I'll call up right now.
- Kindly go ahead.

1913
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:16,600
Do you have 50 paisa with you?
- Shut up.

1914
01:43:16,600 --> 01:43:17,800
Do you have one?
- Shut up.

1915
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:20,800
Thank you.

1916
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:22,200
It's a fake one.
A fake one. Fake one.

1917
01:43:24,600 --> 01:43:25,800
Keep quiet.

1918
01:43:27,800 --> 01:43:29,200
Hello.
- Who is it?

1919
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:32,000
There's a call for you.

1920
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,600
Look, if you try to act smart,
we'll not spare you.

1921
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:37,800
Hello. Yes, this is Roma speaking.
- Who, Roma?

1922
01:43:37,800 --> 01:43:39,200
You daddy has come to our place..

1923
01:43:39,200 --> 01:43:40,200
.. he wants to meet you.

1924
01:43:40,400 --> 01:43:41,400
Why? Is he okay?

1925
01:43:41,400 --> 01:43:43,000
He's fine, but you come soon.

1926
01:43:43,200 --> 01:43:44,600
But where?
- Note down the address.

1927
01:43:45,400 --> 01:43:47,400
Just a minute. Pen?
- Pen.

1928
01:43:47,400 --> 01:43:48,600
Pen.

1929
01:43:48,600 --> 01:43:51,000
Oh, lipstick. Write..
Write with the lipstick.

1930
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:52,800
Where shall I write? Paper.

1931
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:54,800
Paper. Paper. Write on
the mirror. On the mirror.

1932
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:56,000
Yes, tell me.
- Write.

1933
01:43:56,200 --> 01:43:58,000
Boss, I have called
up at the residence.

1934
01:43:58,200 --> 01:44:04,200
Oh, the clear picture
will be in front of us now.

1935
01:44:12,400 --> 01:44:14,000
Wait. Who are you?
- I'm Roma.

1936
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:15,000
Then you can go in.

1937
01:44:15,200 --> 01:44:16,600
The boss is waiting for you inside.

1938
01:44:16,600 --> 01:44:18,000
Girl. Girl. Girl.

1939
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:19,400
Wait, you fool, behave properly.

1940
01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:20,400
Excuse me.
- Yes.

1941
01:44:20,600 --> 01:44:21,600
I am Roma.

1942
01:44:21,600 --> 01:44:23,000
You can go inside. Go inside.
- Thank you.

1943
01:44:23,200 --> 01:44:26,800
Wait. Roma in double role.
Hands up. You are fooling us.

1944
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:30,600
Roma. And I am the ultimate.

1945
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:33,200
Inspector Harihari Dhara.
Wait. Wait.

1946
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:38,000
Daddy. What is going on, Daddy?

1947
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:39,200
She is telling this to you.
- Tell me now.

1948
01:44:39,400 --> 01:44:40,600
Now say that she is not
your daughter.

1949
01:44:41,200 --> 01:44:42,000
You shut up.

1950
01:44:42,200 --> 01:44:43,400
So he is your daddy?
- Yes.

1951
01:44:43,600 --> 01:44:45,600
And he is your mother..
I mean to say, is he your husband?

1952
01:44:45,800 --> 01:44:46,200
Yes.

1953
01:44:46,400 --> 01:44:49,200
I feel that I have to make an
ashtray out of your head, too.

1954
01:44:49,200 --> 01:44:51,200
Are you a boss or a barber?

1955
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:52,400
You mean to say that I am a barber?

1956
01:44:52,400 --> 01:44:55,600
You fool. I mean, boss, can't
you follow such a simple thing..

1957
01:44:55,800 --> 01:44:57,400
..that a secret
agent has no relatives?

1958
01:44:58,000 --> 01:44:59,400
He knows only two relationships.

1959
01:44:59,800 --> 01:45:01,200
Friendship or enmity.

1960
01:45:01,400 --> 01:45:05,200
What am I to you?
- A friend. Friend. Friend.

1961
01:45:05,400 --> 01:45:06,800
So they are your enemies?

1962
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:08,200
Yes.
- Tie them up.

1963
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:09,800
I am already tied up.

1964
01:45:09,800 --> 01:45:11,200
Then tie them to the pillar.

1965
01:45:11,400 --> 01:45:12,200
Pillar. To the pillar.

1966
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:13,600
Daddy, they are..
What are you saying, Daddy?

1967
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:15,400
I am not your daddy.
Yes, tie them up. Tie.

1968
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:17,200
Yes, boss, shake only one leg.

1969
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:25,400
Don't show your teeth, you baldy.

1970
01:45:25,600 --> 01:45:27,600
Think about what is
going to happen further.

1971
01:45:27,800 --> 01:45:29,000
Think about the future later..

1972
01:45:29,200 --> 01:45:30,000
..first look behind.

1973
01:45:30,400 --> 01:45:31,200
Where?

1974
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:33,000
You fool.
- You fool.

1975
01:45:33,200 --> 01:45:35,800
Do we have more ropes?
Good. Tie them up.

1976
01:45:36,600 --> 01:45:38,800
Is anyone in? No one in the house?

1977
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:43,000
I have already decided at
home that come what may..

1978
01:45:43,400 --> 01:45:46,400
..I'll compromise with the brigadier.

1979
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:48,400
He cannot harm me.
Will he shoot me?

1980
01:45:48,600 --> 01:45:49,600
I don't care.

1981
01:45:50,200 --> 01:45:51,000
Lord of death Yamraj..

1982
01:45:51,200 --> 01:45:52,200
.. had told Savitri..

1983
01:45:52,400 --> 01:45:54,000
..that you have to
live and die here itself.

1984
01:45:54,200 --> 01:45:55,600
You cannot escape death.

1985
01:45:55,800 --> 01:45:57,600
Is anyone in? Is anyone in there?

1986
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:01,200
Hey, what is this? Who tied you up?

1987
01:46:01,800 --> 01:46:03,800
Why didn't you tell me? Speak up.

1988
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:07,000
Speak up. Speak up.

1989
01:46:07,600 --> 01:46:10,400
Roma had come. They picked
up the phone and ran away.

1990
01:46:10,600 --> 01:46:12,200
Phone. The phone is
lying over here.

1991
01:46:13,800 --> 01:46:16,000
Not the phone.
They got a phone call.

1992
01:46:16,200 --> 01:46:17,200
They kidnapped Roma.

1993
01:46:17,200 --> 01:46:19,200
Where did they flee? Who fled?
Do you know the address?

1994
01:46:19,600 --> 01:46:21,800
Yes.
- Tell me quickly. What?

1995
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,400
Oh, this is written in English,
I don't know to read English.

1996
01:46:26,600 --> 01:46:27,800
I have failed five times
in matriculation exams.

1997
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:29,000
You cannot read English?
- Yes.

1998
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,200
Shame on you.
Even I can't read it.

1999
01:46:31,200 --> 01:46:32,600
What shall we do now?

2000
01:46:32,600 --> 01:46:34,800
No problem,
I'll ask anybody outside.

2001
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:36,400
Lots of people are
educated outside.

2002
01:46:36,600 --> 01:46:41,400
Hey. Hey, release me.
Mister, release me and go away.

2003
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:49,600
Thank God. I think they are dead.

2004
01:46:50,200 --> 01:46:51,200
Rs. 500.

2005
01:46:53,600 --> 01:46:55,600
Brigadier, do you
know these two monkeys?

2006
01:46:55,800 --> 01:46:58,800
Sir, he is Harihari Dhara
and he is Girihari Dhara.

2007
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:00,400
Sir, they both were in the army.

2008
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:02,400
They are insane and used
to behave abnormally..

2009
01:47:02,600 --> 01:47:04,200
..so I kicked them out of the army.

2010
01:47:04,200 --> 01:47:06,200
And I'll kick them out of this world.

2011
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,400
Do you own this world?

2012
01:47:10,400 --> 01:47:11,400
Oh, shut up.

2013
01:47:11,800 --> 01:47:13,600
I think that your names
are written on these bullets.

2014
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:15,800
So get ready to die now.

2015
01:47:15,800 --> 01:47:18,200
Sir, sir, if you don't mind,
can I do this..

2016
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:20,400
..auspicious work with my hands?

2017
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:26,200
Wow. A father is going to kill
his daughter and son-in-law.

2018
01:47:26,200 --> 01:47:28,200
It's a great moment to watch.

2019
01:47:28,200 --> 01:47:29,200
Good, brigadier, go ahead.

2020
01:47:29,400 --> 01:47:30,400
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

2021
01:47:30,600 --> 01:47:33,600
But, sir, can I ask
them their last wish?

2022
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:35,000
Why not?

2023
01:47:35,400 --> 01:47:37,400
Tell me, what's your last wish?

2024
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:40,000
I want to see you
going to the gallows.

2025
01:47:40,200 --> 01:47:41,200
Original.

2026
01:47:41,400 --> 01:47:42,400
And what is your last wish?

2027
01:47:42,600 --> 01:47:44,200
I also wish the same.

2028
01:47:44,200 --> 01:47:45,400
Indian woman.

2029
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,200
And you? What is your last wish?

2030
01:47:49,800 --> 01:47:52,400
We wish to be born as
dogs in our next birth.

2031
01:47:52,600 --> 01:47:54,200
And you, an electric pole.

2032
01:47:54,400 --> 01:47:56,800
Pray to God that he fulfils all
your wishes in the next birth..

2033
01:47:57,000 --> 01:48:00,000
.. because only my wish will
be fulfilled in this birth.

2034
01:48:02,800 --> 01:48:05,800
Okay, now fire. Shoot from there.
Come on, hurry up.

2035
01:48:05,800 --> 01:48:08,800
Hurry up.
- Wait, buddy. Let me enjoy the murder.

2036
01:48:08,800 --> 01:48:11,200
It's no fun if the person about
to die does not feel the pain.

2037
01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:14,600
All insane people have
gathered in one place.

2038
01:48:14,800 --> 01:48:15,800
I'll see them.

2039
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:21,600
Begin from here. Wait.
Wait, come out.

2040
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:22,800
What are you doing?

2041
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:24,600
Okay, now tell me, who are you?

2042
01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:25,800
When did you arrive and
from where have you come?

2043
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:27,000
And how did you come?

2044
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:28,400
I'll tell you everything.

2045
01:48:28,600 --> 01:48:30,600
But first tell me,
why have you tied my son?

2046
01:48:30,800 --> 01:48:32,400
Whose son?
- My son.

2047
01:48:32,600 --> 01:48:33,600
Which son?

2048
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:35,000
He.. He.

2049
01:48:35,200 --> 01:48:36,800
I don't have a father.
I mean to say that..

2050
01:48:36,800 --> 01:48:38,400
..I do have a father,
but he is not here.

2051
01:48:38,600 --> 01:48:41,600
"The crow will bite you if you lie."

2052
01:48:41,800 --> 01:48:43,600
You fool, you have
come here as well?

2053
01:48:43,800 --> 01:48:44,800
Do you know him?

2054
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:46,000
I know him. I know him well.

2055
01:48:46,200 --> 01:48:47,400
He is a useless, cheap
and hopeless human being.

2056
01:48:47,600 --> 01:48:49,800
Yes, he is my relative and
she is my daughter-in-law.

2057
01:48:49,800 --> 01:48:51,200
No, she is my daughter-in-law.

2058
01:48:51,200 --> 01:48:52,400
No, she is my wife.

2059
01:48:52,400 --> 01:48:53,400
But, I am his daughter-in-law.

2060
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:55,000
If you are his daughter-in-law,
then you are not my daughter.

2061
01:48:55,200 --> 01:48:56,200
But I am your son-in-law.

2062
01:48:56,400 --> 01:48:57,400
Then who is my son?

2063
01:48:57,600 --> 01:49:00,800
Listen, we know who
is related to whom.

2064
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:05,000
But we'll not tell anything because
we are the sons of our motherland.

2065
01:49:05,200 --> 01:49:06,800
Sons of the motherland.
Now who is this motherland?

2066
01:49:07,200 --> 01:49:08,000
Can you tell me?

2067
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:08,800
I am not aware about this.

2068
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:10,200
And number two.
Where is number two?

2069
01:49:10,400 --> 01:49:12,400
I am here.
- Shut up. I'll go mad. - Yes.

2070
01:49:12,400 --> 01:49:13,600
This is a secret den.
- Yes.

2071
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:15,000
No one can come in.
- No one can come here.

2072
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:16,400
No one can ever come here.
- Never.

2073
01:49:16,400 --> 01:49:18,800
Is this a picnic spot or is a family
get-together happening over here?

2074
01:49:18,800 --> 01:49:20,800
Yes.
- And you are saying that this is..

2075
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:22,200
..one of the most beautiful places in
the world, it's a secret den.

2076
01:49:22,200 --> 01:49:23,400
Do one thing,
put up a board outside.

2077
01:49:23,400 --> 01:49:24,600
'Cold beer sold here'.

2078
01:49:24,600 --> 01:49:26,400
Beer is sold over here.
And shut up.

2079
01:49:26,600 --> 01:49:27,800
What are you doing?

2080
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
I have untied the ropes from behind.

2081
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,600
Brigadier.
I'll have to kill everybody now.

2082
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:33,800
Come on.

2083
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:35,600
Ladies first. Ladies first.

2084
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:02,400
Mr. Sundaram.
- What happened?

2085
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:06,400
Come on, daughter-in-law, hurry up.

2086
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:08,400
I'll begin with my job.

2087
01:50:08,600 --> 01:50:11,200
Look. Help.
Catch hold of that goon..

2088
01:50:11,200 --> 01:50:12,800
.. he is after the boss.

2089
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:14,800
Hey, you are working for a baldy..

2090
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:16,800
..can't you work for a hairy one?

2091
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:19,600
Oh, you are changing the
party since you are caught now.

2092
01:50:19,800 --> 01:50:21,400
Just a minute. Just a minute.

2093
01:50:21,800 --> 01:50:22,600
What did you say?

2094
01:50:22,800 --> 01:50:24,200
Nothing.
- Did you say anything? - No.

2095
01:50:24,400 --> 01:50:25,400
Or did I hear anything?

2096
01:50:25,600 --> 01:50:27,600
Did you say anything?
Or did you say anything?

2097
01:50:27,600 --> 01:50:29,400
No, but I heard it.

2098
01:50:30,600 --> 01:50:32,400
Look, can't you see
that we are talking?

2099
01:50:32,400 --> 01:50:33,800
Oh, sorry, sorry.

2100
01:50:33,800 --> 01:50:35,400
Yes, what did you say?
- Nothing.

2101
01:50:35,400 --> 01:50:38,400
No, I heard something.
I heard some noise.

2102
01:50:38,400 --> 01:50:39,600
Excuse me, sir.
- What did you say?

2103
01:50:39,600 --> 01:50:40,800
Someone is knocking, sir.

2104
01:50:41,600 --> 01:50:42,800
You fool, you shouldn't
hit like this.

2105
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,200
Make a fist. Make a fist.
Now look here.

2106
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:54,200
Attack, my hungry tigers.
I have raised you for this day.

2107
01:50:54,200 --> 01:50:55,400
Kill.

2108
01:52:01,800 --> 01:52:04,200
Stop fighting. The
police have arrived. Police.

2109
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,400
Commissioner,
arrest this scoundrel first.

2110
01:52:10,400 --> 01:52:11,800
He is the boss of the gang.

2111
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:15,400
And take this
brigadier also along with you..

2112
01:52:15,400 --> 01:52:16,600
..and hang him to death.

2113
01:52:17,200 --> 01:52:21,400
Hey, sir knows his duty well,
you don't interrupt.

2114
01:52:23,800 --> 01:52:27,200
Hello, brigadier, I hope you didn't
face any problem in this mission?

2115
01:52:27,400 --> 01:52:30,800
Not physically, sir.
But my heart was shattered to pieces.

2116
01:52:31,400 --> 01:52:32,800
Thinking that
I have stooped so low..

2117
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:37,000
.. in front of my daughter and
son-in-law, which has no limits.

2118
01:52:37,600 --> 01:52:39,800
I am feeling sad about one thing, sir.

2119
01:52:39,800 --> 01:52:41,200
Neither could I
explain them anything..

2120
01:52:41,200 --> 01:52:42,600
..nor they understood anything.

2121
01:52:43,200 --> 01:52:46,800
I wanted to reach to
the boss of this gang..

2122
01:52:48,200 --> 01:52:51,000
.. by showing all the
fake maps and documents.

2123
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,600
I can understand, sometimes
you have to become a thief..

2124
01:52:53,600 --> 01:52:55,600
..to catch the thief.

2125
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,800
You have saved the country
from getting destroyed and doomed.

2126
01:52:59,600 --> 01:53:01,400
We all salute to you.
- Wow.

2127
01:53:01,400 --> 01:53:04,800
Mr. I G, I have heard that
you are not keeping well?

2128
01:53:05,600 --> 01:53:06,600
No, nothing like that.

2129
01:53:06,600 --> 01:53:08,800
Even then you cannot predict life.

2130
01:53:09,200 --> 01:53:12,200
This is my card,
my rates are very economical.

2131
01:53:12,200 --> 01:53:13,600
I beg your pardon.

2132
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:18,200
"Petals in our arms and
fragrance in the petals."

2133
01:53:18,400 --> 01:53:23,000
"Your youth lies in the fragrance."

2134
01:53:24,800 --> 01:53:28,000
"Petals in our arms and
fragrance in the petals."

2135
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:31,200
"Your youth lies in the fragrance."

2136
01:53:31,400 --> 01:53:38,000
"Don't follow me, don't
cook-up any false stories."

2137
01:53:38,200 --> 01:53:41,600
"You are a branch full of flowers."

2138
01:53:41,600 --> 01:53:44,400
"You are a branch full of flowers.."

2139
01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:48,600
"..don't prick thorns in my heart."

2140
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:54,600
"Come here. Pretty girl, come here."

2141
01:53:54,800 --> 01:54:01,000
"Go. Go there, you naughty boy."

2142
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
"Don't hold my hand like this."
