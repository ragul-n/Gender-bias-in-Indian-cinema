00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,320
Got an information as drugs are smuggled.
Check properly.

2
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,720
- Where are you now?
- Checking on Vallam road.

3
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,640
- In intersection road?
- Yes, sir.

4
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,280
- Don't leave even a single bus.
- Okay, sir.

5
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,120
Hey, what do you've in that bag?

6
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,640
It's getting late for school

7
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,000
Everyone show your bags.

8
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,400
What's that you've in that bag?
Take it.

9
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,160
Can't believe anyone, nowadays.
Whether men or women.

10
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,640
Don't know what they do?

11
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,160
Take your bag, dude.

12
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,080
Sir, I must go to the school.
Start the vehicle, soon.

13
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,320
Hey, sit down.

14
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,520
Get signature from those
who are suspicious and send them, sir.

15
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,000
- Checking all the passing vehicles, sir.
- Okay, go...

16
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,760
Checked out all the passing vehicles.

17
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,080
They said there is drug packet,
But didn't get anything.

18
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,480
Sir, 321 calling.

19
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,240
Checking is going on
at Sangampatti toll gate.

20
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,240
Thiruvaiyaru road is also under alert, sir.

21
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,560
Danny is arriving to the spot.

22
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,240
Handler is also accompanying him.
Over.

23
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,880
We, the policemen were unable
to do anything

24
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,280
What will this dog do?

25
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,520
It's a brilliant dog in everything
 like narcotics, bomb snatching.

26
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,000
Sir!

27
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,880
Will Danny find out?

28
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,880
What did you say?
He is my son.

29
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,920
Have you seen?

30
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,280
Do you think him like you,
wearing uniform and working for money?

31
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,520
Roll no.320, sir.

32
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,520
Caught the accused in the bus.
He has hidden the drug in his hip.

33
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,120
I'll hand over him to
the narcotics department, sir.

34
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,200
'Karate will be taught here.'

35
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,040
Louis Braille,invented the system of
 reading and writing for visually impaired.

36
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,280
He left peacefully leaving
these two girls.

37
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,120
Both of them are pestering me.

38
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,840
Your uncle has brought
 many proposals.

39
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,400
Don't you like at least
anyone of these guys?

40
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,240
Mom!

41
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,720
She isn't right for all those.

42
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,680
You look for a bridegroom,
 I'll get married.

43
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,640
She too irates...

44
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,000
What now?
You want me to get married, right?

45
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,000
I've kept a photo turned over.
Accept that guy.

46
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,800
Relax!

47
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,920
Leave now.
Let's see tomorrow.

48
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,080
Awful! Is he my sister's husband?
Is he okay for you?

49
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,480
It's enough if I like my husband.

50
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,360
At least, she accepted him.

51
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,240
Mom, do you remember the conditions
 for my marriage?

52
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,320
He must get the
Police Inspector job soon.

53
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,480
He'll get the job.

54
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,760
I'll ask your uncle
to talk with bridegroom's parents.

55
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,600
'Drug addiction of school children
in Tamilnadu.'

56
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,840
'Informs the National Commision for
Protection of Child Rights.'

57
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,520
- Lalitha!
- What?

58
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,720
'Detailed news.'

59
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,000
The gravy shouldn't be salty.

60
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,600
See, if your son is awake?

61
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,320
My son!

62
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,680
He'll wake up, sniffing your cooking.

63
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,680
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Tell me.

64
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,200
- Are you sleeping?
- I'm watching a film..

65
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,760
Listen me properly.

66
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,760
I mixed your photo along the
 photos brought by the middleman...

67
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,640
...and said I like you
and selected your photo.

68
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,640
Good!

69
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,520
The middleman will come
 seeking for you.

70
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,800
Be ready.
Okay?

71
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,280
Wait, I'll call you later.

72
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,800
Nothing is here.

73
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,000
Has dad ate?

74
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,240
Mom!

75
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,560
Oh, as usual it's for Danny!

76
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,640
Mom, had he given birth
 to me or this dog?

77
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,760
Hey, speak slowly.

78
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,920
- It's okay if he heeds...
- Welcome, brother.

79
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,040
...but if the dog heeds
won't it mistake us?

80
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:17,920
Why sudden visit?

81
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:23,720
Brother, you can show little concern
on your son as you care for the dog.

82
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,160
You are a heart patient.

83
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,520
Brother, this dog too
 is fed by that dog.

84
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:32,080
If gets paid by the Government
and feeds all three of us on it's own.

85
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,320
Mom, let me get the results
 of SI exam.

86
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,000
Then, not that dog
 but you've to come behind me.

87
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:41,160
Hey, is the SI post a stuff
for money to buy immediately?

88
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,240
Do you know it's value?

89
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,240
Leave about the job.

90
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,640
Let's finalize the bride,
I've suggested.

91
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,520
It's said both are girls.

92
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,760
Will they get them married
 without anything?

93
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,840
Or will they do anything?

94
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,160
I like the bridegroom!

95
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,000
My sister asked me
 to say like that.

96
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,880
Brother, it's finalised.

97
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,440
Instead of postponing the days,
 it's better to fix the marriage.

98
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,120
It's tough to get
 the wedding halls later.

99
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:25,240
From now on to third month,
 24th day, Sunday is auspicious day.

100
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,360
Shall we fix the marriage
on that day?

101
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,160
- It's more auspicious day.
- They'll come even without brushing.

102
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,520
It's said as engagement
 but the bridegroom is not seen.

103
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,920
Dude, are you here?

104
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,120
Hey, she is the bride's mother.
The bride is next to her.

105
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,320
Her mom is beautiful than bride.

106
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,480
The bride is beautiful, dude.

107
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,880
- Hey, Manda kasayam!
- Sir, greetings!

108
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,080
Let's see whether you're
 a lucky charm to get him a job?

109
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,080
They're changing your fate.

110
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,400
Prepare the tea, soon.

111
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,000
Fresh up, first.

112
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,280
Did you wake up just now?

113
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,080
Why smoke is emerging
from the fields?

114
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,480
Someone would've lit the cigar
and thrown it.

115
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,840
Look after your work.

116
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,080
What to do if the field catches fire?

117
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,880
Instead of asking me,
 go and check it.

118
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,000
She too...

119
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,840
Why is it smokey in the mid
 of the field?

120
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,480
Will it catch fire
if thrown a cigar?

121
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,880
Drunkards...

122
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,960
Oh,no!
Dear.

123
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,720
- Don't come.
- What happened?

124
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,360
- Why are you shouting?
- Get lost from here.

125
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,280
- Go away.
- Tell me.

126
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,240
Why are you bringing the childrens here?

127
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,400
Greeting, sir

128
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,000
Hey, it's said something
was caught fire.

129
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,000
- Where is it?
- It's here, sir.

130
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,560
Move away.

131
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,520
- What are you doing here?
- Who has witnessed it at first?

132
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,440
It's me, sir.

133
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,600
Hurry up after you did work

134
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,640
At what time did you see?

135
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,960
At 6 o'clock in the morning.

136
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,280
Is it?

137
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,840
Didn't anyone else see it?

138
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,120
No, sir.

139
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,000
These people will come
 carrying the cameras.

140
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,400
Hey, stay there.

141
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,120
Don't know whether
the burnt is male or female?

142
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,560
Call the forensic people
and tell them to come.

143
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,520
Okay, sir.

144
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,240
Called more than ten times.

145
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,880
It's completely burnt.

146
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,680
Can't identify which is head and foot.

147
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,200
Check it soon and tell me.

148
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,920
Tell him whatever you've seen.

149
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,480
Okay, sir.

150
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,160
Okay, sir.

151
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,480
Sir, Keshavan from Gandharvakottai
has filed a complaint...

152
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,080
...that his wife went missing.

153
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,720
He is coming to the spot.

154
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,400
Oh, no!

155
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,520
Don't know what happened?

156
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:01,760
Lynching and setting on fire
has become common.

157
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,560
He has to come from Gandharvakottai.

158
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:08,120
Have you given complaint
 as your wife was missing?

159
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,840
Yes, sir.
 what happened?

160
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,080
Hey, bring that here.

161
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,360
Why the crowd is here?

162
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,760
What happened?

163
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,160
Tell me.

164
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,160
Sir, it's my wife's chain.

165
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,800
Sir, my wife's chain.

166
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,160
Sir.

167
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,960
'People's women
Varalaxmi Sarathkumar'

168
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,400
'Danny'

169
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,000
'Vairavaraj belongs to Ezhupatti village
near Thanjavur.'

170
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,680
'He is a farmer who got married to...'

171
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,200
What a cruelty it is!

172
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:23,480
Caste killing is on the rise
but adultery killing too is ascending.

173
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,480
That's happening everyday.

174
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,400
That's nothing.

175
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,480
He saw her close with someone
 in the sugarcane field.

176
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,320
Will he be quiet after seeing her?

177
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,400
That's why, he doused her with petrol
and set on fire.

178
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:36,600
He tortured and buried
his wife using petrol.

179
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,440
Hey, Periyai!
Are you aware?

180
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,760
A girl has been burnt
to death at Ezhupatti.

181
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,360
This is happening throughout the world.

182
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,600
Women have become cheap
 to these people.

183
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,920
Look after your work.

184
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,080
That's also right.

185
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:04,400
Veni, for panchakavyam, mixing three kgs
of curd, one and half litres of ghee...

186
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,120
...six litres of cow's urine,
 don't leave it idle.

187
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,080
It'll solidify.

188
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,280
Mix well.

189
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,800
Why are you sitting here, still?

190
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,320
The ploughing would've been over.

191
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,560
Take the pulses and go.

192
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,520
The pulses should fall on
 the land before noon.

193
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,480
Else, my daughter will kill me.

194
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,760
Leave from here.

195
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,640
- Nagarajan brother!
- What?

196
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,480
You've stopped ploughing
just in two rounds.

197
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,480
Who will plough the last?

198
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,840
We're going to sow the pulses.

199
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,760
Why to plough?

200
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,680
It's okay.
we have pesticide, right?

201
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,040
Go and plough.

202
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,120
Okay.

203
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:04,720
Thamayanthi and Masilamani
has come to meet you.

204
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,280
What's the matter?

205
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,160
You've to give them a solution.

206
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,520
They're waiting.
Go.

207
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,880
Aunt, what's the issue today?

208
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,640
It's been two years since she borrowed
 five lakh rupees from me.

209
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,440
She borrowed for her son's wedding.

210
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,440
He has given birth to a child also.

211
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,920
She paid the interest for a year.

212
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,080
But not giving now.

213
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,160
When asked, she is giving excuses.

214
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,800
Ask her for justice.

215
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,840
Did you lend me free?

216
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,880
You've given me for interest.

217
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:36,600
And you got signatures in
 promisory note and cheque leaf.

218
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,000
Why are you in hurry?

219
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,920
- Did I escape from this village?
- She wasn't able to repay the money.

220
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,360
Why are you quarreling?

221
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,520
Earlier, you'll take the
cows for grazing...

222
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,320
...and brought a bundle of grass also
 back to home.

223
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,720
You had love and affection.

224
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,440
You thought of being with people around.

225
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,840
Now, you've coconut plantations
 and sitting idle at home...

226
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,960
...and making money out of chits, interest
 and creating ruckus.

227
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,520
It's the foreign money
making you do so.

228
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,600
Aunt, how much is the interest?

229
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,000
Ten rupees!

230
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,640
If a case is filed, you'll be
imprisoned on usury.

231
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:17,080
Aunt, I thought on the day of
 your son's lavish wedding...

232
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,520
...that you're spending
 someone's money and not your's.

233
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,400
What I thought is right.

234
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,200
You're borrowing money
 for interest from all.

235
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:23,840
Aren't you ashamed?

236
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,480
What to do, Kundhavai?

237
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,920
My son left to Quwait
 soon after his wedding.

238
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,440
He didn't send me single penny.

239
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,240
But sends everything for his wife.

240
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,480
Moreover, the farming isn't good.

241
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,520
How could I pay the interest
and the principal?

242
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,640
Tell me.

243
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,080
Aunt, you bought one and half lakhs
as interest for a year.

244
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,360
Why are you still asking for interest?

245
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:49,640
I don't know what you'll do,
 within thirty days...

246
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,800
...you must repay the principal to her.

247
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,680
Look, no interest will be given
 to you, henceforth.

248
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,840
Take the principal amount
 given by her and leave.

249
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,520
If you don't repay the money
on time..

250
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,800
...aunt will take over your yields.

251
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,400
Sister! Both the aunts will indulge
 in fuss today and get compromise, later.

252
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,800
It's enough of your 'kangaroo court'.

253
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,480
Come soon,
 It's getting late for me.

254
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,200
Better, she would've studied law
 like her father.

255
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:15,000
Instead of going to court
and earning money...

256
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,120
...he solved all the cases at home.

257
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,280
Now, it's her turn.

258
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,120
I'm leaving, Indrani.

259
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,240
I'm leaving, sister- in- law.

260
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,520
If I don't have the ancestors property,
think of my stance.

261
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,120
Tell me, sir.

262
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,520
Kundhavai, congratulations for
 being promoted as 'Inspector'.

263
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,720
Thank you, sir.

264
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,720
Sister, will you clear all the cases
in the police station...

265
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,920
...like 'kangaroo court'
without filing cases?

266
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:02,000
Will it be good to inquire
the relative's cases?

267
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,440
If the case is tough,
I'll file the FIR.

268
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:08,800
Earlier, you worked far away.
So, I stayed in the hostel.

269
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:13,280
Now, you've come.
Commute me, everyday.

270
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,280
Come.

271
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,000
'Govt.Hr.Sec.School for
the Visually impaired.'

272
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:56,200
Today, we're going to
 learn about the sounds.

273
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,320
You will all like the birds, right?

274
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,040
- I like.
- I like, sister.

275
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,040
You'd have heard many sounds.

276
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,680
And you'd have heard
your favourite bird's sound.

277
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:12,720
Now, you must make
the sound of your favourite bird.

278
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,240
Who are all ready to do?

279
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,000
Me

280
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,440
You...

281
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,200
Okay.

282
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,880
Periyanayagi, you do.

283
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,440
Very good!

284
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,360
Excellent!
Everyone applaud her.

285
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,440
Okay, next is the vehicles.

286
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,440
We'll know about
 the sounds of the vehicles.

287
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:37,280
For that, I'll play the sound
 of a vehicle on speaker.

288
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,560
You must say
which vehicle's sound it is.

289
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,800
Okay?

290
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,600
Sister, I know.

291
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,600
That's the sound
 of a share auto.

292
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,680
Excellent, Kumaran!

293
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,440
How do you exactly say
 it as share auto?

294
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,720
Auto's sound will resemble
that of the scooter.

295
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,960
This is different.

296
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,920
Excellent!
Give applause to Kumaran.

297
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,360
Well done!

298
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,600
Okay, now I'll play
the next sound.

299
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,440
Let me see,
who finds out exactly.

300
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,040
Good morning, mam.

301
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,160
You shouldn't weep here.

302
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,480
It's the police station.

303
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,080
- You shouldn't go there.
- Won't you heed?

304
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,760
Save my son, mam.

305
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,760
Good morning, mam!

306
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,720
No need of these formalities.
Come.

307
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,960
'S. Kunthavai'

308
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,920
You...
Selvam!

309
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,600
First, roll call must be taken
 in the police station.

310
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,840
Generally, roll call is done
after a week.

311
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,480
Now, it's for you.

312
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,960
I want all the FIR case files
on my desk, immediately.

313
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,000
Okay, mam.

314
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,200
Thirty three villages comes under
our station limits.

315
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,800
Eleven villages are in block list.

316
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,600
Those people don't know
when they'll indulge in fuss...

317
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,000
...and when they'll stay united.

318
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:09,000
Twenty seven FIR's were filed
 in this month.

319
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,480
Nine robbery cases.

320
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,120
Six land dispute cases.

321
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,320
- Twelve usury cases.
- Yes, mam.

322
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,760
Three murder cases.

323
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,480
You've filed FIR for all the cases.

324
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,800
But, only seven people
were remanded as accused.

325
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,280
What about others?

326
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,000
Are you afraid or taken bribe?

327
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,360
A woman was crying when I arrived.

328
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,240
Who is she?

329
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,240
A murder has happened in Ezhupatti.

330
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,560
His wife had an illicit affair.

331
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:36,680
He had beaten her by stone
 and set on fire.

332
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,240
We caught him and remanded
 on the same day.

333
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,680
Did you catch him the same day?

334
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,560
Yes, mam.

335
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:45,000
When inquiring the neighbors,
it's known that he is a drunkard...

336
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:48,560
...and beats his wife, everyday.

337
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:52,720
Who will lead a family life
 with a drunkard?

338
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,720
Hey, who is that?

339
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,800
That is...
He is known to me...

340
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,840
Known to me...

341
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,280
- Nothing...
- Hey, you...

342
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,480
Get lost.

343
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:42,480
Those who betray the husband
 shouldn't be alive.

344
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,080
My brother- in- law's son
had a love marriage.

345
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,960
I think, she is from
 the east of Mandala kottai.

346
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,720
He'll work hard throughout the day.

347
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,160
And inebriated at nights.

348
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,080
He is my cousin brother, sir.

349
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,320
Our relation.

350
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,040
I think, husband and wife
will quarrel at nights.

351
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,440
He fell in love with her
and got married.

352
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:21,080
Won't a husband will be furious
 if he witness his wife with someone?

353
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,920
That's why, he had beaten her
 to death.

354
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,040
Many alcohol bottles will be there
near his house.

355
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,520
Don't know what happened, sir.

356
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,400
Audible to some extent.

357
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,400
They indulge in fuss, every night.

358
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,320
But, we didn't expect he'll murder.

359
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,560
We don't have any relationship
with his family, sir.

360
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,160
With the evidences we got on the spot
 and with these statements...

361
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,800
...we've decided, he was the murderer.

362
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,720
We arrested him and filed FIR too.

363
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:50,080
With the bones, we confirmed
the burnt body is a female.

364
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,840
- Okay, you can leave.
- Okay, mam.

365
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,400
Did Danny come to the spot?

366
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,520
No, mam.
We didn't inform the dog squad.

367
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:01,280
Because, the evidence we got there
 is enough to arrest the accused.

368
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,880
Where is the spot?

369
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,320
Greetings, mam!

370
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,600
That side.

371
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:30,040
- Where was the blood stain spotted?
- Near the motor shed...

372
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,640
Don't know when it'll end?

373
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,240
- Who is the owner of this place?
- It's me, mam.

374
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,120
When did you fix the motor?

375
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,200
It's more than a week, mam.

376
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,040
- Did you slaughter anything?
- The blood of rooster, mam.

377
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,040
Won't you check whether
it's the blood of human or bird?

378
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,280
A bangle piece, five
litres of fuel container,

379
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,000
a piece of cigarette and a syringe.

380
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,560
Did you arrest the accused
with these as the evidence?

381
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,720
- Did you check the fingerprints?
- Yeah, we've checked, mam.

382
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:12,640
As his fingerprint and
forensic result didn't match,

383
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,040
we didn't close the case, yet.

384
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,440
Has Danny arrived?

385
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,280
Who is Danny, sir?

386
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,920
In the dog squad of crime branch,

387
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,040
Danny, a sniffer dog is in
the post of Inspector.

388
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,640
Why are you wondering
 just for this?

389
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,720
It has posting from PC to IG grade.

390
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,520
Was it paid or...?

391
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,800
Daily allowance, medical allowance,
 twelve thousand rupees salary...

392
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:40,160
...and if it dies, we must take off
our hats and salute it.

393
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,160
I've informed the dog squad, mam.
They will come in the morning.

394
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,480
- Hey, Mariappan!
- Tell me, sir.

395
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,880
I've locked and kept the key.

396
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,400
- Will you come soon?
- I'll come, sir.

397
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,320
Danny!

398
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,760
Danny!

399
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,800
He wished to get his son married.
But, he isn't gifted enough!

400
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,680
(Epicedium)

401
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:55,600
He was going
behind the dog till his death.

402
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,480
Don't say like that.

403
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:00,400
Chidambaram got good reputation in the
department after the advent of the dog.

404
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,280
He never stayed apart from this dog
even for a minute.

405
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,360
Mam, Chidambaram is a sincere officer
 in our department.

406
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,280
Soon, arrange for the benefits
 he has to get.

407
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,560
Good morning, mam!

408
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,400
Who are these people?

409
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,200
Accused who were threatening
 the Thanjavur district by pick pocketing.

410
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,800
Only one person will be
 caught as accused.

411
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,320
But, you brought four people.

412
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,800
We can't say all these people
are accused.

413
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:26,320
If we go to a shop to buy apples,
 don't we select a good apple?

414
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,560
Similarly, I brought all these accused,

415
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,800
Better select one among those.

416
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:34,480
Oh, no! She is starring me, furiously.

417
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,040
Who are you?

418
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,360
I was selling snacks.

419
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,320
I was selling chat items.

420
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,720
I'm the parotta master, mam.

421
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,560
What about you?

422
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,200
I went to buy coconut, mam.

423
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,800
He rolled my head
as scattered coconut.

424
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,160
I told you catch the accused,
instead you brought vendors.

425
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,080
That's nothing, mam.

426
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:56,360
Manda Kasayam's sniffing power is down,
as it got cold and nasal congestion.

427
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,080
That's why, we brought them all.

428
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:03,400
If it's Danny, he would've caught
the accused from any corner.

429
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,760
Lord!

430
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:09,000
They brought my son
who went to temple.

431
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,240
They brought my son
who went to temple.

432
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,440
Then, how the ** in the temple
 are stolen?

433
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,680
Hey!

434
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,920
Ask him, well.

435
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,160
Send all of them.

436
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,320
Are you a policeman?
Get lost.

437
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:27,200
- Mam, Danny is missing from Kennel.
- Is Danny missing?

438
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,560
You're saying it simply
as if a street dog is missing.

439
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,280
It's the Government property.
Search properly.

440
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,280
Okay, mam.

441
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:38,120
Mam, I think Danny must've gone
 to handler Chidambaram's house.

442
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:59,320
It came far away.

443
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,880
It must be more affectionate
 on chidambaram.

444
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,720
Now and then, he must have been
 familiar with the dog...

445
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,040
...when going around with his father.

446
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:07,880
Try to get him Chidambaram's job
 on mercy quota.

447
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,080
Okay, mam.

448
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:19,360
It was known on enquiry,
 her husband is the murderer.

449
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,600
And at the moment of closing the case,
 why are you inquiring it again?

450
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:25,080
Sir, with the evidence
we got there...

451
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,040
...we can't say Vairarajan
 has did the murder.

452
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,280
What are you trying to say?

453
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,440
Sir, it might be the blood
of the hen, slaughtered there.

454
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,440
The cigarette piece might
be thrown by the workers there.

455
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,520
His finger prints doesn't match
 with anything.

456
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,480
They've boozed in the field.

457
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,400
That empty bottles
 might be their's.

458
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,920
The fuel container would've been
 used to buy diesel for the motor.

459
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,480
Upon enquiring, damn sure Vairarajan
 wouldn't have done this murder, sir.

460
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:52,240
It's not the single life,
but two lives were lost.

461
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,720
She was pregnant
 for three months.

462
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,960
I too heard about it.

463
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,400
- Okay, you take up that case.
- Okay, sir.

464
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,880
But, a small request.

465
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:05,640
If it's interior, within some parameter
 we can get the evidence.

466
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,760
As it's exterior, we don't know
where will we get the evidence, sir.

467
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:12,080
It'll be more helpful,
if Danny is with me, now.

468
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,320
It's very abnormal
 after handler Chidambaram's death.

469
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,520
That's true, sir.

470
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:20,000
But, Danny is more close
 to his family.

471
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:23,440
Especially, it's close to
his son Neelakandan.

472
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,040
I think, if we assign him
 as the handler...

473
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,800
Definitely, Danny will recover soon.

474
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,920
Okay, let's see.

475
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,280
Okay, sir.
Thank you.

476
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:37,160
It's tough to earn the
good reputation of a father by sons.

477
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:41,320
But, if Danny recovers soon,
you'll get it on your own.

478
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:44,440
I'll help it to recover, soon.
Thank you, mam.

479
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:53,800
In everyone's house,
the siblings will be compared.

480
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:57,720
But, in my house,
I was compared with you.

481
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:01,840
I felt ashamed of comparing me
 with a dog.

482
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:06,440
Even my dad will say, I'm having food
 from the earnings of the dog.

483
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:10,040
What am I upto?
I felt bad, then.

484
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:13,800
But, I got this job because
 of you, Danny.

485
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:19,320
My father nurtured you
 like a son, until he was alive.

486
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,760
I didn't understand that even a day.

487
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,640
Come on, Danny.

488
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,360
In the training to be held tomorrow,

489
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,840
You must save
my father's reputation, Okay?

490
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,280
Brother, Danny is undergoing a test there.

491
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,480
You're boozing here.

492
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:43,040
Those who studied with me settled well
and enjoying in air- conditioned bars.

493
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,880
I'm stuck with this dog
and having this low priced alcohol...

494
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,360
...and by eating peanuts
my life might end.

495
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,080
This is more than enough for you.

496
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,400
You sinners.

497
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,600
Hey, this is cooked for the dog, isn't it?

498
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,360
No, brother.
It's two in one.

499
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,720
- Two in one?
- Yes, brother.

500
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,400
I'll make my dog to lick your face.

501
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,720
Already your face is like that only.

502
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,240
What a stinky smell!

503
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:18,080
It'll be stinky if you take
 contaminated alcohol.

504
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,640
Are you cursing me?

505
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,720
I'll drink even the acid.

506
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,880
Don't act as if you're poor.

507
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:45,080
Our department hails you people
who owns foreign dogs.

508
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,080
Who respects people like me
who has country dogs?

509
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:51,080
Get lost!
Damn foreign dog?

510
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,840
First, I must lynch
the veterinary doctor.

511
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:57,480
From the time, he gave the dog
and named it as, 'Manda kasayam'...

512
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,640
...It's making me to struggle.

513
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,480
Hey, doctor! I'll come
 and bite your throat.

514
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:06,280
There is no medication
 at international range.

515
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,480
You get lost!

516
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,560
You steal the things given
to the dog and give to doctor...

517
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:16,320
One day, I'll mix the cockroaches
in the food.

518
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,640
Hereafter, I shouldn't get anything
 from him and eat.

519
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,920
He might poison the food.

520
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,840
Hey, be quiet for sometime.
Shouting continuously.

521
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,320
Hey, take it.

522
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,760
Danny, take it.

523
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,280
'P. Danapal'

524
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,760
Hello!

525
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,680
Remove the gloves
 and shaken your hands.

526
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:56,480
It's stenchy.

527
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,840
Why do you want me to
remove the gloves and give hand?

528
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,760
Showing attitude, though taming
 the cow.

529
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,800
It's you who've attitude
 being with the dog.

530
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,200
Okay, leave it.
Come here.

531
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:08,960
Come on.

532
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:10,640
Come on.

533
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,720
I must sit on your lap,
if you want me to come, still.

534
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:19,000
Look there, he is the new handler.

535
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,840
Better, tell him.

536
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,880
Performing well, not revealing
 the one next to you.

537
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,760
The one next to me
 is not seen.

538
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,400
Hello, doctor!
I'm Neelakandan!!

539
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,360
Hello, Neelakandan,
 I'm the Doctor.

540
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:35,680
Who is he? Looking like a goof
 in crackers explosion.

541
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,480
You brought me to him.

542
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,680
Hey, do you want fitness certificate
for Danny?

543
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,400
Yes, I want.

544
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,880
He has to give that.
Shut your trap.

545
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:47,040
Doctor, Danny's fitness certificate.

546
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,800
Why are you in hurry?

547
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,680
Be patient.

548
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:52,880
I've to talk an important matter
with you.

549
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,480
No, doctor.

550
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,560
My wedding is in four days.

551
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,040
- What? wedding?
- Yes, doctor.

552
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:00,160
You're roaming like
an ** auto.

553
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,400
Do you need a pooja too?

554
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,720
Doctor, speak properly.

555
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:06,360
As I couldn't see you,
I'm looking at him and speaking.

556
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,000
Doctor, allow me to talk.

557
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:11,640
Leave some space.
Breathe well.

558
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,840
Better, leave him free.

559
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,400
You speak now.

560
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,600
Doctor, I'll come straight away
 to the matter.

561
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,800
Hey, you're going to
 get married, right?

562
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,840
Then, what?
Am I a doctor or a nurse?

563
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:28,000
I'm Dr.Dhanapal, B.A.,B.L
 Engineering with two papers arrears.

564
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,640
So, I'm only doctor.

565
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,760
You carry on.
Proceed.

566
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,120
Uncle!

567
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:37,280
Wait, I'm also panicked.
Be patient.

568
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,680
Let's talk.

569
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,360
What?
 Tell me.

570
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,560
Doctor, it's been a week
since my father died.

571
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,280
Oh!

572
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:49,600
People started gossiping
that her arrival is inauspicious.

573
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,160
To shut their mouths...

574
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,320
Apply m- sand.
It'll be alright.

575
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,760
That's all.
Simple!

576
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,440
Why did you come so far
 just for this?

577
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,680
Uncle, is he the doctor
or a mason?

578
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,440
You get the certificate.

579
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,760
Hey, I thought he'll talk
about dog's intimacy...

580
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,320
...but he is talking about himself.

581
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,480
Leave it.

582
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,800
You said to talk about
an important message.

583
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,400
- What's that?
- There is a project with him.

584
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:16,640
The value of the project
is fifteen lakh rupees.

585
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:18,960
Fifteen lakh rupees?

586
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,120
If you complete that
 project, perfectly...

587
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,120
You'll get a commission of
 one lakh rupees.

588
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,880
What should I do now?

589
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,840
Come on.

590
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,280
Come on.

591
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,760
Come on.

592
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:32,560
Hey, what are you looking at?

593
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,400
Get lost.

594
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,360
Sit carefully.
The injection might get intruded.

595
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,120
Sit down.

596
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:39,160
Already, many people have done this.

597
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,800
Neelakandan has a dog
named, 'Danny', right?

598
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,480
Yes, so what?

599
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,960
That breed is in high demand, now.

600
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,000
What should I do, now?

601
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,720
If you let the dog
 to ** with few,

602
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,560
We can live, lavishly.

603
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,080
Is the deal okay or not?

604
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:00,320
Do you want me take up
the middleman job you did?

605
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,760
You talk too much.

606
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,360
Better leave.
I'll get the job done with someone else.

607
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,280
Don't be hurry, doctor.

608
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,440
Just watch, how I do the job,
co-operatively.

609
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:13,360
If you do me a favour,
I'll also do you the same.

610
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,720
Where is the nurse, Doctor?

611
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,280
Stupid, I said about the salary.

612
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,400
Tell me

613
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,680
Which name?

614
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,640
Hey, when mam asks about
 the incidence happened...

615
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,320
...on that night at Ezhupatti,
we must tell her the fact.

616
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,400
Come on.

617
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,480
Greetings, mam.

618
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,840
On that day, there was electricity
 at day time.

619
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:04,040
So, I left home early
as I was in the field the whole day.

620
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:07,560
I ate and slept
as soon as I went home.

621
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:10,560
I was watching soap operas
 till 11pm.

622
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:13,280
In television noise,
I didn't heed any sound.

623
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,960
Don't know whether
any car went, later.

624
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,520
You go.

625
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:20,440
I'll get trembling,
once it becomes dusk.

626
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,960
I don't know even
 if a murder happens, mam.

627
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,680
I swear, I don't know, mam.

628
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,680
I'll be on high.

629
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,640
I bought alcohol after 10.30 pm.

630
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,760
A car has arrived.

631
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,200
Damn it, he didn't give me lift.

632
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,920
Generally, will Danny behave
 like this in all cases?

633
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,200
In general, if the sniffer dog
suspects an object or a place...

634
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,600
...it'll convey the handler, mam.

635
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,440
It'll bark once.

636
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:47,040
If the handler notices,
 it'll look up and bark twice.

637
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,440
We'll understand,
it's confirmed, mam.

638
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,680
If it's sowing season,

639
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:01,160
...there might be tyre marks
of the lorry, tractor like vehicles.

640
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,480
If it's reaping season,

641
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,360
...there might be the markings
of the lorry or other heavy vehicles.

642
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:11,280
Now, in the yielding season,
that too in sugarcane field...

643
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,440
...how the car tyre markings
were present?

644
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,160
I too have the same doubt, mam.

645
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,760
What happened?

646
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,040
Tell the fact.

647
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:39,000
You'd have watched in TV
 and other media.

648
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,040
I'm a drunkard.

649
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,320
Suspected my wife.

650
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,520
As my wife was with another person
 in sugarcane field,

651
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:52,520
Being enraged, I had beaten her
 to death and blazed her.

652
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:55,640
Why should you kill the girl,
who you fell in love and got married?

653
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,680
I think, you didn't do this murder.

654
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:27,040
Mam, I didn't kill my wife.

655
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,480
I came home after work.

656
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,000
She wasn't there.

657
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,200
I searched for her, everywhere.

658
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,640
I filed a complaint
 in the police station.

659
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:40,360
But, they manipulated the case
as they want.

660
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,080
And made me as accused
and imprisoned me.

661
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,800
Even that's okay, mam.

662
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:57,440
They said without conscience,
that my Dhanam has an illicit affair.

663
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:02,000
That's what I can't tolerate, mam.

664
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,800
Mam, the press people has arrived.

665
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,760
We got an important evidence
in the case of a girl...

666
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,240
...who was blazed to death
 at Ezhupatti.

667
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:23,800
That evidence reveals, her husband
Vairavarajan didn't do this murder.

668
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,360
What's that evidence, mam?

669
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,280
If we reveal everything to you,
how can we find the culprit?

670
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:31,080
Earlier, you said her husband
 is the reason for this murder.

671
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:33,360
Now, you say someone is
related to this murder.

672
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,960
What's happening in your department?

673
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,200
Will you arrrest this culprit, at least?

674
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,600
Investigation is going on,
we'll find out soon.

675
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:42,320
It's said, a dog had found
 the evidence.

676
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,400
- Is that true?
- That's not simply a dog.

677
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:47,160
Danny, is a officer like us.

678
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,680
How can you say so confidently?

679
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:02,200
It's the first case in my hometown.

680
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:06,480
In this case, Danny will also travel
with me.

681
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,080
Kundhavai!

682
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:15,200
What, mom!

683
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,920
She is waiting for long time
 to meet you.

684
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,000
- Ask her.
- My goddess.

685
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,280
Why are you falling
on my foot?

686
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:26,880
You're my family deity!

687
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:30,600
I don't feel shy to
touch your feet.

688
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:32,840
Why? Is it because I said
your son wasn't the murderer?

689
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,120
No, mam.

690
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,520
The entire people blamed
and cursed my son...

691
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:41,160
...as drunkard and murderer.

692
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:45,360
It's you who said that
my son is innocent...

693
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,880
...which made me feel good.

694
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,520
You must stay blessed!

695
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:53,680
It's not necessary to take
 the law to punish the culprit.

696
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,880
We can take the law
to save the good.

697
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:03,760
Why have you come here, mam?

698
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,840
Madhivadhini is staying
in this hostel and studying.

699
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,400
I came to meet her.

700
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:10,520
Neelakandan, the clue found
 by Danny on that day...

701
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,240
...was very helpful to this case.

702
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,320
Thank you, mam!

703
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,480
Come home with your fiancee, one day.

704
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,560
Mathi!

705
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,720
Who are you?

706
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,440
Hey!
Stop!

707
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:29,880
Hey!

708
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,760
Mathi!

709
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,760
What happened to my daughter?

710
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,840
Your sister is out of danger, mam.

711
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:35,080
But, as she was severely hurt
on head.

712
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:38,440
The blood vessels of eyes
was ruptured.

713
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:42,920
We tried our best.
But, she lost her sight.

714
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,520
Oh, no!

715
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:49,920
My lord!
What have I done to you?

716
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:13,000
"Who has seen the fullness
 of the sky?"

717
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:19,440
"Who has lived the whole life?"

718
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:25,160
"We came to this world to leave"

719
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:30,960
"And to thank with tears"

720
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:36,680
"The sounds, the sounds of soul"

721
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:42,440
"The truth will lit in the heart"

722
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:48,040
"The affection, that's enough!"

723
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:54,360
"The colour of love, paints our life"

724
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:03,200
Our Mummy was lose her behalf
after father death...

725
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,400
that time I'm not mature

726
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,600
But I thought you are
behalf mine of our father

727
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:16,440
Whenever mom cried,
 how to bring up two girls...

728
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:21,040
...without the support of a male,
I was feared.

729
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:25,120
But, when touching your fingers
 and looking your face...

730
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:28,320
...my fear and worries
 will wane off.

731
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:33,720
Now, I can't see your face, sister.

732
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:41,240
Sister, I haven't done anything wrong.
I don't have enemies.

733
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,840
I didn't cheat anyone
 in the name of love.

734
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,360
Please, believe me, sister.

735
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:49,440
I'm your sister.
I'm Guruchev's daughter.

736
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:51,320
I didn't do anything wrong.

737
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:55,280
Hey, don't I know?
you've no enemy on this earth.

738
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:58,720
It's not you, they came to murder.

739
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:00,840
 But, it's me!

740
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:17,600
Roll no, 302 speaking.

741
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:18,880
Got an information
that a body...

742
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:20,320
was blazed at Madhakottai
cashew plantation.

743
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:22,440
Someone from Kallaperambur station
attend it.

744
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:44,560
Mam, got an information that a body was
blazed at Madhakottai cashew plantation.

745
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:47,360
I tried calling SI.
His cellphone is out of service.

746
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:50,040
- That's why, I called you mam.
- Okay, do one thing.

747
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:51,640
- You go to the spot, immediately.
- Okay, mam.

748
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:54,600
Call the VO, get the report
and file FIR.

749
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:57,040
Try to reach SI, again.

750
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:59,440
And don't forget
 to inform the dog squad.

751
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,560
What are you doing here?

752
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:45,000
"You.. are my dream"

753
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:54,840
"You.. are my soul"

754
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:03,600
"I am the shadow"

755
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:09,600
"You're the reality"

756
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:11,640
How can we digest this one?

757
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:17,120
"Who has seen the fullness
 of the sky?"

758
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:23,200
"Who has lived the whole life?"

759
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:29,040
"We came to this world to leave"

760
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:34,800
"And to thank with tears"

761
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:40,440
"The sounds, the sounds of soul"

762
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:46,320
"The truth will lit in the heart"

763
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:52,000
"The affection, that's enough!"

764
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:57,960
"The colour of love, paints our life"

765
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:03,600
"We bought our breath
 from the wind"

766
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:09,520
"When our day is over,
 we give it up and leave"

767
00:56:21,391 --> 00:56:26,671
"All bonds are illusions"

768
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:32,440
"Reality is eternal"

769
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:38,280
"Who has seen the fullness
 of the sky?"

770
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:44,000
"Who has lived the whole life?"

771
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:49,800
"We came to this world to leave"

772
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:55,480
"And to thank with tears"

773
00:56:55,560 --> 00:57:01,160
"The sounds, the sounds of soul"

774
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:06,920
"The truth will lit in the heart"

775
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:12,360
"The affection, that's enough!"

776
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:18,600
"The colour of love, paints our life"

777
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:24,240
"We bought our breath
 from the wind"

778
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:30,320
"When our day is over,
 we give it up and leave"

779
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,040
Isn't it you lied
that you'll pick me up.

780
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:36,560
You cheated me, everyday.

781
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:40,840
Sister, today IVS Dhanapal has donated
 our blind school students...

782
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:44,760
...the bags, attires, blind sticks
and many more.

783
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:49,080
Sister, how was the lunch, today
which I did?

784
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,240
Did you eat or discarded it?

785
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:53,320
Sister, today is your birthday.

786
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:56,720
Myself, students and teachers
 will be waiting for you with cake.

787
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:58,600
Come on time, please.

788
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:17,720
Madhivathani is a good girl.
She'll try to make everyone happy.

789
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:18,320
Pity on her!

790
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:21,520
Whether I remember my birthday
 or not, she'll remember, mam.

791
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:24,080
I saw her the last.
She went with a smile.

792
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:24,880
Where did she go?

793
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:28,560
She went to see Kumaran
as he wasn't well.

794
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,640
She said, she'll come back, mam.

795
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:34,520
But, we didn't even think
all these will happen, mam.

796
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:36,400
Often, she brings Kumaran.

797
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:39,360
She never behaved as
a teacher to him.

798
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:43,760
One day, Kumaran was sick.
She came to see him.

799
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:46,040
He is like her brother, mam.

800
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:54,280
Mam!

801
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:58,280
Does our sister has
the habit of using drugs?

802
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:02,040
Are you aware,
whom are you talking about?

803
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:09,360
No, mam.

804
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:11,640
The doctor wants to speak
to you about it on phone.

805
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:12,720
That's why...

806
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:21,400
Tell me, doctor.

807
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:26,520
Mam, according to the autopsy report,
phenicyclidine drug is mixed overdose.

808
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:27,440
'Phencyclidine' means?

809
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:29,920
It's called shortly as, 'PCP'.

810
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:34,320
It's an 'angel dust'.

811
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:37,560
That is, it's an anesthesia.
Mostly used in surgical theatres.

812
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:41,280
We can't get it in any medical stores
without the doctor's prescription.

813
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:44,560
Doctor, where can it be used
other than the surgical theatres?

814
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:46,720
It can be used as a drug also, mam.

815
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:48,800
- What do you say?
- Yes, mam.

816
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:52,400
Today, many youngsters
have started using it as a drug.

817
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:55,520
How much quantity will be used
as a drug, normally?

818
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:57,200
0.5mg.

819
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:00,320
But, that gives elation
for the consumers.

820
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:01,520
If it exceeds?

821
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:04,240
They'll fall in coma.
Else, quick death.

822
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,120
What's the medicine name
 you said, mam?

823
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:08,880
'Phencyclidine'.

824
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:12,040
Then...
Sorry, mam.

825
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:14,880
As a doctor, I must say
 this to you.

826
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:17,280
I don't know how to convey
 this to you.

827
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:21,520
Not only drug,
she was brutally raped.

828
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:25,000
It was known by
 autopsy summary, mam.

829
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:36,840
Okay, doctor.

830
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:51,600
First, I thank you all
for coming here.

831
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:52,880
- Yes, mam.
- It's okay, mam.

832
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:58,160
'Phencyclidine', I think you know more
about this drug than me.

833
01:00:58,280 --> 01:00:59,480
Yes, mam.

834
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:02,800
Recently, you'd have heard
about the death of two girls...

835
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:04,400
...and might've watched in news.

836
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:07,400
This drug is related to that case.

837
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:10,280
Mam, you're trying to ask
something. Ask frankly.

838
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:11,440
Good!

839
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:13,160
Where else is this drug available?

840
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:15,640
It's available at hospitals
 and medical stores, mam.

841
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:18,960
What you say is the legal availability.

842
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:21,160
I'm asking about illegal availability.

843
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:22,600
Illegal?
No chance, mam.

844
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:24,600
Why are you saying like that?

845
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:26,920
You can't buy it anywhere
without the 'doctor's prescription'.

846
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:28,960
Oh!

847
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:33,480
The doctors who use
 this drug and the medical stores...

848
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:36,240
...where it's available
 must be informed to me, immediately.

849
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:40,480
And I want the narcotics case
 details from the nearby police stations.

850
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:41,600
Okay, mam.

851
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:49,240
Hello!

852
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:51,560
I'll Come.

853
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:53,400
Okay, sir.

854
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:59,040
Mam, that boy wants
 to meet you.

855
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:02,200
Kumaran, madam has come

856
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:05,160
Mathi sister didn't leave
by regular car, on that day.

857
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:07,000
She left in some other car.

858
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:08,440
What?
Other car?

859
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:10,040
Will you identify the car
 if you see it?

860
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:12,600
Sorry, mam!

861
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:14,160
How are you saying that?

862
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:20,720
Sister, we'll find out
the vehicle with the sounds.

863
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:25,880
After our class, we both
were waiting outside.

864
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:31,200
At that time, a sound emerged.
A car arrived.

865
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:37,600
An uncle got down from the car
 and said Kundhavai mam told to bring her.

866
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:42,120
Mathi sister asked why Ganapathy uncle
who regularly pick her up didn't come?

867
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:44,640
He replied that he got fever.

868
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:49,600
He said, that's why he came
and took her in the car.

869
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:51,880
The car left in high speed.

870
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:09,280
Kumaran, I'll play the sounds
 of the car.

871
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:14,280
Will you say exactly the sound
of the car sister left?

872
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:15,440
Heed this.

873
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:19,400
No.

874
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:25,200
Heed now.

875
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,960
Yes, it is!
This is the sound, mam.

876
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:33,320
This kind of sound doesn't
emerge in branded cars.

877
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:37,160
- It must be a modified model.
- Is modification done in Thanjavur?

878
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:38,200
Who are all doing this?

879
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:39,680
Specifically, the lancer cars.

880
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:41,560
I've done for two or three people.

881
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:42,560
To whom have you done?

882
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:44,480
Arulanandha Nagar, Ramkumar.

883
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:47,280
Then...
 I can't remember, properly.

884
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:49,520
Greetings!
 Tell me, mam.

885
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:51,720
Thirukanupatti, Yacob Nagar.
Exactly, two days ago...

886
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:53,160
That is, on 15th.

887
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:55,720
Evening 5 to 6 o'clock, whatever
sports cars commuted on that way...

888
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:59,600
...I want information about
those cars, immediately.

889
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:00,560
Okay, mam.

890
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:08,600
That signal...
Signal...

891
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:09,640
That camera!

892
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:11,440
Rewind a little.

893
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:14,640
Play the second camera.

894
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:24,480
Hello!

895
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:27,520
Mam, a yellow sports car
has passed that way...

896
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:29,080
...at the time you mentioned.

897
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:31,560
It crossed through Rajappa Nagar,
SP hospital...

898
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:34,240
...and went near the tower clock
 in Ramanathan Nagar.

899
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:36,720
Whose vehicle is that
and the address...

900
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:38,680
...get those details from RTO
 and send me, immediately.

901
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:39,720
Okay, mam.

902
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:54,160
Mam, I'm Palaniappan,
from RTO.

903
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,240
Tell me, sir.

904
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:57,080
From the CCTV footage
you had given me...

905
01:05:57,120 --> 01:06:00,800
...I've sent all the details
about the yellow car to your phone.

906
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:02,920
Okay, thank you.

907
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:09,200
Who is that?

908
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:10,800
Isn't there anyone
in the opposite house?

909
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:12,880
They've been to Singapore
 for their daughter's delivery.

910
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:14,480
Any problem, sir?

911
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:16,560
Nothing, just an inquiry.

912
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:18,200
Isn't there anyone else?

913
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:19,520
Their son is there.

914
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:20,320
Can I get his contact number?

915
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:21,720
- Just a minute, sir.
- Okay.

916
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:36,320
Hey!

917
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:39,800
Hey, the police has come
to the house.

918
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:42,920
I pleaded you not to
 take the the car...

919
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:44,120
... did you heed me?

920
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:47,200
Now, with the car number
they've come to the house.

921
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:48,640
I only will be caught red handed.

922
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:53,680
At last, both of you
made me get stuck.

923
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:54,440
Where is your cellphone?

924
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:57,560
You told me to switch it off.
That's why, I did.

925
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:00,280
Thiruvaiyaru PS, the number is received.

926
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:01,640
We are checking all over.

927
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:05,480
Find out which is the nearest tower.

928
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:06,840
Control room, did you track
 the cellphone tower?

929
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:08,920
Sir, we are tracking.

930
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,600
He must be within the city limits.

931
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,200
Give your identity card.

932
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:15,960
Hey, give your identity card.

933
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,520
- For what?
- Just give.

934
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:25,920
Hey, Kavi!
Stop!

935
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:30,480
Hey, Kavi
Tell me something.

936
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:32,320
Why are you silent?

937
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:34,240
I'm scared.
Tell something.

938
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:36,120
Hey!

939
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:39,640
Hey, Kavi!

940
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:43,280
Hey! Tell something.

941
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:45,080
I'm scared,
 we might get into problem.

942
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:48,960
Hey, Kavi!
They have found the car.

943
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:51,920
Police have come searching
 to home.

944
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:53,840
I don't understand anything
 if you be like this.

945
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:55,880
Hey, what's that are you doing?

946
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:00,280
Saravana! you ask him, at least.

947
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:01,440
What are you doing?

948
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:09,360
You'll not fear, any more.

949
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:46,560
No CCTV camera.

950
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:48,480
Bottles all over.

951
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:50,400
And ** here and there.

952
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:51,920
Not giving bribe, if asked also.

953
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:54,160
What are you doing?
Come upstairs.

954
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:55,560
I'll look after you, later.

955
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:11,800
There are many places to blaze,
 will you blaze upstairs?

956
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,400
I can't!

957
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:29,840
Sir, analysing the bones, the dead seems
to be 20 or 21 years of age.

958
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:42,600
Sir, I'm SI selvam
speaking from Kallaperambur.

959
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:46,080
Kundhavi mam came here
for inquiry.

960
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:48,320
Post her visit,
 the murder has happened.

961
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:01,720
Mam, I'm his father.

962
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:03,840
Didn't his mother come?

963
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:06,880
She left to Singapore
 for elder daughter's delivery.

964
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:08,480
I was also there.

965
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:11,560
But once I came to know
my son was dead...

966
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:13,800
...I asked her to start.

967
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:17,840
She said, 'I'm not coming for sake
of a ruined son...'

968
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:20,960
...and asked me to go
and do the final rites.

969
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:27,000
Mam, I came since my son
shouldn't be an orphan corpse.

970
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:33,960
He will always leave
 to play cricket.

971
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:42,000
By dawn, I'll be nervous
 if he won't return.

972
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:49,280
My wife will console me
 saying is he a small kid?

973
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:54,600
He left us stranded.

974
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,080
Saravanan is my son.
 He is a good boy.

975
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:06,400
He lost his father.
 Don’t hurt him.

976
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:08,520
I don’t know whether
 your son is innocent or not?

977
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:10,240
Right now, where is he?

978
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:12,680
For past one week,
he hasn't turned up.

979
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:15,200
I promise upon the God.

980
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:17,120
What's this?

981
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:19,200
You've written a report
like people...

982
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:21,000
who has seen the murder spot
and narrated a story.

983
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:23,560
Sir, upon enquiring and
going close to the accused...

984
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:25,520
...he is killing the people around.

985
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:27,600
You're saying, he
is killing of fear.

986
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:30,920
But, it's said in the department
as you're killing everyone...

987
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:33,480
...to take revenge
 for sake of your sister.

988
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:37,400
Sometimes, I'm also suspicious on you.

989
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:41,840
Sir, since it's a blood relationship case
do you think I'll do like this?

990
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:44,440
If you think so,
I don’t have any answer.

991
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:45,880
As far as I am concerned...

992
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:48,920
...I'm dealing all my cases
on humanitarian basis.

993
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:52,120
If you've faith on me,
handover this case to me.

994
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:56,920
Very soon, I'll produce the accused
 at the court and file chargesheet.

995
01:13:57,280 --> 01:13:59,680
So, you've almost identified
 the main accused.

996
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:02,080
- Close the case at the earliest.
- Thank you, sir.

997
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:04,080
Mom, why are you
 calling me, repeatedly?

998
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:04,680
Hey, where are you?

999
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:06,040
I came out with Danny
for a walk.

1000
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:07,000
Hey, you could've ate and left.

1001
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:08,080
Mom, you eat.
 I'll come, later.

1002
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:09,600
Come soon, how long to
 wait for you?

1003
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:10,880
Mom, you eat and go to bed.

1004
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:11,920
What’s the time now?

1005
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:13,720
Don’t you've thought
of coming home?

1006
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:16,520
Don’t roam at late night,
better come home soon.

1007
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:18,200
Mom, don’t scold.
 I'll come.

1008
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:19,800
Okay, come safely.

1009
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:24,120
- Are you Saravanan's mother?
- Yes, sir.

1010
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:25,000
What happened?

1011
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:26,520
Mam asked you to meet her
 at the police station.

1012
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:28,120
Why, sir?
 Has he done any mistake?

1013
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:33,240
Danny and your father,
while chasing a red color car...

1014
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:35,840
...it seems, he died.
This is the talk in the department.

1015
01:14:42,920 --> 01:14:44,640
Danny, wait here.

1016
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:45,760
I'll be back.

1017
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:51,560
Hey, Kavi!

1018
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:54,080
Police have come to my house
 in search of me.

1019
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:56,920
They had enquired with my mom.

1020
01:14:58,040 --> 01:15:00,720
We were living
in our own world, happily.

1021
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:03,640
Unnecessarily, the medical store girl
disturbed us.

1022
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:07,120
We killed her.

1023
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:13,120
While in high, the ** girl came
and fell on her own in our trap.

1024
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:16,720
We killed her too.

1025
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:27,600
After informing everything to the press,
the inspector is searching for us, now.

1026
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:32,200
We must kill that Police Inspector too,
as we did her sister.

1027
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:35,960
Give me the phone.

1028
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:38,120
Hey, don't want.
 I'm scared.

1029
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:39,040
Give me.

1030
01:15:58,960 --> 01:15:59,600
Dad!

1031
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:02,200
Where are you, now?
What are you doing?

1032
01:16:02,360 --> 01:16:04,320
- Dad, just listen to what I say.
- Okay, tell me.

1033
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:06,320
As you said,
I'll go to Bangalore.

1034
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:08,640
When I said, you didn’t go.
But, why now?

1035
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:14,840
I need a car and some money.

1036
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:16,840
Why do you need a car
to go to Bangalore?

1037
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:17,720
Why do you want money?

1038
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:19,240
You come home, first.
 I'll give you.

1039
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:43,800
Mam! I'm Neelakandan, speaking.

1040
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:54,760
Don't want it

1041
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:56,120
Just do what I say

1042
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:02,560
Mam, since 5 a.m
the car is parked here.

1043
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:05,640
Our people came
 to the spot, immediately.

1044
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:08,560
As it was the suspected car,
 I called you, immediately.

1045
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:22,880
This the vehicle and the person
we were searching.

1046
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:23,440
Okay mam.

1047
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:24,800
Inform to forensic department.

1048
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:26,440
- Don’t miss out any evidence.
- Okay, mam.

1049
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:28,880
I need the autopsy report
 on my table, immediately.

1050
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:29,760
Okay mam.

1051
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:09,920
I lost my wife 12 years ago.

1052
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:12,560
My son lost his mother.

1053
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:15,440
Since he is my only son,
 whenever he asked for money...

1054
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:17,920
...I gave him more than he need.

1055
01:19:18,040 --> 01:19:21,160
But, I never thought
 that money will change his life.

1056
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:39,040
Instead, it took him to another world.

1057
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:48,440
I stopped giving money, thinking
 the reason for him...

1058
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:49,720
...to get spoiled was money.

1059
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:50,800
Hey, Kavi!

1060
01:19:51,240 --> 01:19:52,160
Where are you going?

1061
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:53,640
- To see my friend.
- Where is the purse?

1062
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:54,800
Dad, what are you doing?

1063
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:56,200
Give me the purse.

1064
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:00,800
Hey!
I'll bang you...

1065
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:04,760
Without my knowledge, he stole PCP,
anaesthesia medicine from my hospital...

1066
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,680
...and started using it as a drug.

1067
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:11,840
Also used my prescription...

1068
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:13,800
...to purchase the medicine
 in medical store.

1069
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:15,720
Sir, give me.

1070
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:20,440
Phencyclidine!

1071
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:23,200
- Sir, why do you need this high dosage?
- How much should I pay?

1072
01:20:23,720 --> 01:20:24,920
For whom is the surgery?

1073
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,320
Doctor prescription is there right?
give me the medicine.

1074
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:27,720
Ten numbers of 5ml quantity!

1075
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:30,160
Sir, no doctor will prescribe this high.

1076
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:31,400
Why are you asking?

1077
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:34,280
This doesn’t look like
 Dr. Muthiah's handwriting.

1078
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:36,360
Sir, I've worked with this doctor.

1079
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:37,920
This is not his signature.

1080
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:40,400
Why are asking this?
Tell me the truth.

1081
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:42,400
- I'm his son.
- So?

1082
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:43,600
Give me the medicine.

1083
01:20:43,640 --> 01:20:46,120
I'll call the doctor,
 if he tell me, I'll give you.

1084
01:20:46,160 --> 01:20:47,960
- Hey!
- Okay? Just wait.

1085
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:49,960
- Hello!
- What? Tell me.

1086
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:51,360
No need.

1087
01:20:52,120 --> 01:20:54,040
He is saying as doctor's son.

1088
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:55,760
Something is wrong.

1089
01:20:58,760 --> 01:20:59,880
Hello, doctor!

1090
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:20,840
His name is Perumkavi.

1091
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:26,480
He is the one who raped
and blazed Dhanam and Madhivadhini.

1092
01:23:26,760 --> 01:23:28,880
Fax his photo to all
 the police stations, immediately.

1093
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:30,040
- Do it immediately.
- Okay, mam!

1094
01:23:30,120 --> 01:23:32,800
Check all the vehicles
commuting in and out of the city.

1095
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:33,680
Yes, mam!

1096
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:10,400
Go...go...

1097
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:52,040
Hey!

1098
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:25,840
Mam!

1099
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:29,760
Neelakandan.

1100
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:01,280
Mam has come.
I'll call you back.

1101
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:03,000
Do you think that
your duty is over,

1102
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:05,040
by putting up a poster
as, 'culprit wanted'?

1103
01:32:05,360 --> 01:32:07,560
The police can find out a culprit.

1104
01:32:07,720 --> 01:32:10,400
But, public can stop the crime.

1105
01:32:10,520 --> 01:32:12,560
Mam, when are you going
to find out the accused?

1106
01:32:14,040 --> 01:32:14,640
Excuse me.

1107
01:32:14,680 --> 01:32:15,400
Mam!

1108
01:32:15,480 --> 01:32:17,520
Mam, you are talking irrelevantly.

1109
01:32:19,640 --> 01:32:21,160
- Kundhavai!
- Yes, sir!

1110
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:25,800
Not trusting me, the Minister is compelling
 to transfer the case to CB- CID.

1111
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:27,560
What are you doing?

1112
01:32:27,960 --> 01:32:31,080
Sir, as asked by the minister,
 transfer the case to CB- CID.

1113
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:32,240
What?

1114
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:33,280
Thank you, sir

1115
01:32:34,920 --> 01:32:36,640
Mam, what are you saying?

1116
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,520
For his drug addiction,
 he will kill others.

1117
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:44,360
What’s the use of filing a case,
taking to court and imprisoning him?

1118
01:32:44,680 --> 01:32:48,680
He will come out,
smile and do the same.

1119
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:52,800
According to me,
what I did is right.

1120
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:21,600
Carrying our dreams,
we stood behind the door.

1121
01:33:21,640 --> 01:33:24,800
Today, we've excelled
only because of education.

1122
01:33:25,240 --> 01:33:30,080
Threatening us by acid and knife,
forcing us for marriage...

1123
01:33:30,160 --> 01:33:35,280
...They dishearten us and thinks of making
us to stand behind the doors, again.

1124
01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:39,840
To break this, we should stop
being our own enemy.
