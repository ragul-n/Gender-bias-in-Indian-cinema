00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,915
- Wish you all the best.
- Thank you.

4
00:02:28,165 --> 00:02:29,540
Mr. Pritam, you?

5
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:31,582
Yes, son. I've come to take you.

6
00:02:31,873 --> 00:02:34,415
- How is mother? How is Sarla?
- Fine.

7
00:02:34,498 --> 00:02:37,123
Mother is in Benaras
now with her brother.

8
00:02:37,207 --> 00:02:38,748
And Sarla is at her husband's house.

9
00:02:39,415 --> 00:02:41,832
Sarla's daughter must have grown up.

10
00:02:42,498 --> 00:02:43,873
How old would she be?

11
00:02:43,957 --> 00:02:47,623
- About eight years old.
- Eight years.

12
00:02:48,623 --> 00:02:51,207
Yes, it's been a long time.

13
00:02:51,582 --> 00:02:53,957
Mother and Sarla are
coming to meet you today.

14
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,748
- Come.
- Come.

15
00:03:05,498 --> 00:03:07,207
Manisha, are you here?

16
00:03:08,207 --> 00:03:09,707
Yes.

17
00:03:10,207 --> 00:03:12,332
You didn't let anyone
come to the jail.

18
00:03:12,998 --> 00:03:14,832
So I waited outside.

19
00:03:15,373 --> 00:03:18,707
Really? So you waited
for me all these days?

20
00:03:18,873 --> 00:03:21,415
Yes, Vicky.

21
00:03:22,415 --> 00:03:26,582
And besides that before dying, Uncle..

22
00:03:33,582 --> 00:03:35,165
You've not changed at all.

23
00:03:38,457 --> 00:03:41,040
You're exactly the same.

24
00:03:41,748 --> 00:03:43,957
Not a single grey hair.

25
00:03:44,248 --> 00:03:46,540
Calm and serious.

26
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:50,665
You look like a
Professor of Philosophy.

27
00:03:51,248 --> 00:03:53,582
What are you saying? A murderer..

28
00:03:53,665 --> 00:03:55,290
Stop it. Come.

29
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,998
Come, Mr. Pritam.

30
00:04:53,082 --> 00:04:55,957

32
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:06,582
(Tires Screeching)

33
00:05:08,373 --> 00:05:11,082
Who is this? He comes here every day.

34
00:05:11,165 --> 00:05:13,207
He's a very wealthy boy.

35
00:05:13,457 --> 00:05:15,832
He has a very big factory in Bombay.

36
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:17,790
- Yes.
- He's a millionaire.

37
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,457
If he's a millionaire,
what is he doing in our slum?

38
00:05:21,082 --> 00:05:25,582
- Somu, Mr. Chaudhary's son.
- Yes.

39
00:05:25,665 --> 00:05:27,248
He's his best friend.

40
00:05:27,332 --> 00:05:30,748
After Mr. Chaudhary's death,
he pays for all the house expenses.

41
00:05:30,832 --> 00:05:32,082
This is what you call a friend.

42
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:35,623
Don't say friend.
Somu must be his stooge.

43
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,873
No, they're true friends.

44
00:05:38,165 --> 00:05:40,832
After passing law they
worked at the same place.

45
00:05:40,915 --> 00:05:43,873
They eat,
go out and have fun together.

46
00:05:44,082 --> 00:05:46,540
Yes, they've fun too?

47
00:05:46,873 --> 00:05:49,582
- Mother, Somu isn't ready yet?
- He's getting dressed.

48
00:05:49,665 --> 00:05:51,623
He'll be here. Will you've tea?

49
00:05:51,707 --> 00:05:53,665
- If I get it, I will.
- I'll just bring it.

50
00:05:53,873 --> 00:05:55,582
Somu.

51
00:05:56,332 --> 00:06:00,665
- You've not gone to college?
- Give me fees for college.

52
00:06:01,165 --> 00:06:02,290
Where are my sweets?

53
00:06:02,373 --> 00:06:04,790
Sarla, give him a full box.

54
00:06:04,873 --> 00:06:07,707
No, Mother, I've to go to office now.

55
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:09,790
If you give me a boxful of sweets,
how will I work?

56
00:06:09,873 --> 00:06:11,540
I'll lose a good job.

57
00:06:11,998 --> 00:06:14,207
Listen. Give me a few in my hands.

58
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,623
- Yes?
- Yes.

59
00:06:15,707 --> 00:06:16,998
- Go and get it.
- Okay.

60
00:06:17,082 --> 00:06:18,457
- Give it.
- Here.

61
00:06:20,207 --> 00:06:22,707
So, how is work?

62
00:06:22,915 --> 00:06:25,582
Good. Just lets us learn a bit more.

63
00:06:25,707 --> 00:06:28,123
Then we could open our own office.

64
00:06:28,207 --> 00:06:29,207
- Really?
- Yes.

65
00:06:29,248 --> 00:06:32,582
But if you work yourself,
how will you get lawsuits?

66
00:06:32,623 --> 00:06:35,582
We're not just any lawyers.

67
00:06:35,623 --> 00:06:38,207
Lawsuits will find us. Yes.

68
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:39,873
And if you don't get lawsuits..

69
00:06:39,957 --> 00:06:41,582
Brother Somu and you..

70
00:06:41,623 --> 00:06:43,498
Can file cases on each other.

71
00:06:43,582 --> 00:06:45,998
That is fantastic.

72
00:06:46,082 --> 00:06:49,248
She isn't as stupid as I thought.

73
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,040
She's much more than that.

74
00:06:51,415 --> 00:06:53,040
(Laughing)

75
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,373
(Laughing)

76
00:07:14,623 --> 00:07:16,748
Your clothes are like similar too.

77
00:07:16,832 --> 00:07:19,457
How would I know this
fool would wear this?

78
00:07:19,623 --> 00:07:22,165
And look, twin watches.

79
00:07:22,248 --> 00:07:25,165
Yes. One for that fool,
one for me. Here.

80
00:07:25,248 --> 00:07:27,248
- Vicky.
- First change your clothes.

81
00:07:27,332 --> 00:07:30,707
Or you'll look like fools
in front of the barrister. Go.

82
00:07:32,665 --> 00:07:34,540
Police say the corpse was..

83
00:07:34,582 --> 00:07:37,790
In the room for 96 hours.

84
00:07:38,707 --> 00:07:39,707
This is for sure.

85
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:42,957
But what can prove that
the corpse was dacoit Ram Singh's?

86
00:07:43,498 --> 00:07:47,332
Rather, one thing shows that
the body might be somebody else's.

87
00:07:47,582 --> 00:07:51,207
And that thing is the
watch on the hand of the body..

88
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:53,748
Which was working when
the police found the body.

89
00:07:54,123 --> 00:07:57,040
No watch can work without
charging for 96 hours.

90
00:07:58,165 --> 00:07:59,165
Brilliant, sir.

91
00:07:59,915 --> 00:08:01,832
Yes, beautiful.

92
00:08:02,707 --> 00:08:04,582
Have you made a list of properties?

93
00:08:04,748 --> 00:08:06,790
- Yes.
- Show it to me.

94
00:08:07,165 --> 00:08:09,332
It was somewhere here..

95
00:08:09,415 --> 00:08:10,957
Give it to me.

96
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,707
I say, give it to me.

97
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:19,082
Please leave my office immediately.

98
00:08:20,873 --> 00:08:22,832
I said get out.

99
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:26,165
Okay.

100
00:08:28,498 --> 00:08:29,498
Pen.

101
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:33,123
Useless fellow.

102
00:08:33,707 --> 00:08:35,290
- Somu.
- Yes, sir.

103
00:08:35,373 --> 00:08:38,707
I'll be back in a minute.
Jot down whatever I have told you.

104
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:54,582
(Music Playing)

105
00:09:03,832 --> 00:09:05,082
Shridhar.

106
00:09:05,832 --> 00:09:06,873
- Somu.
- Yes?

107
00:09:06,957 --> 00:09:08,165
I've to go some place.

108
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:09,707
By tomorrow prepare all the lists.

109
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,030
- Can I trust you?
- Definitely.

110
00:09:11,082 --> 00:09:12,540
Thank you very much.

111
00:09:12,998 --> 00:09:14,665
- So, could I leave?
- Okay.

112
00:09:15,165 --> 00:09:17,248
Teresa, take this file and type it.

113
00:09:17,332 --> 00:09:18,582
- Good bye.
- Bye.

114
00:09:18,623 --> 00:09:20,873
- Good bye Miss Teresa.
- Bye.

115
00:09:23,707 --> 00:09:24,707
Brilliant boy.

116
00:09:24,748 --> 00:09:26,790
He'll become a big barrister someday.

117
00:09:26,873 --> 00:09:29,582
Excuse me, sir.
Barrister or an artist?

118
00:09:29,623 --> 00:09:31,165
What do you mean?

119
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:36,915
(Laughing)

120
00:09:37,248 --> 00:09:39,165
- I am surprised.
- Why?

121
00:09:39,248 --> 00:09:41,848
That day you get out me from office
and now you are respecting me.

122
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:44,498
This is office.
Everything have to do legal.

123
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,248
That's why I resigned.

124
00:09:46,415 --> 00:09:50,165
Vikram, his future is in dark.

125
00:09:50,248 --> 00:09:51,290
- Why?
- Just see.

126
00:09:51,373 --> 00:09:53,373
We're bound like a
criminal and a witness.

127
00:09:53,457 --> 00:09:54,558
This tie can never be broken.

128
00:09:54,582 --> 00:09:57,498
The lawyer who doesn't know this,
can't fight a case.

129
00:09:57,582 --> 00:10:00,165
Wow! You are imagine.

130
00:10:00,248 --> 00:10:01,248
Really?

131
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,332
Let us celebrate this freedom.

132
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:06,582
- Yes. Today we're not working for anyone.
- Correct.

133
00:10:06,623 --> 00:10:07,665
Cheers.

134
00:10:13,498 --> 00:10:15,832
(Music Playing)

135
00:10:32,415 --> 00:10:33,207
- Vicky.
- Yes?

136
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:36,165
That blue one is mine.

137
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:38,248
No, you take the yellow one.

138
00:10:38,332 --> 00:10:40,248
She's more beautiful.
I'll take the blue one.

139
00:10:40,332 --> 00:10:41,998
No. I want blue one, friend.

140
00:10:42,082 --> 00:10:45,832
No. What kind of a man are you?
Can't you sacrifice for a friend?

141
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,373
Vicky, you take both.

142
00:10:49,457 --> 00:10:50,457
Right.

143
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:59,040
"Your lover is lonely.."

144
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:13,665
"Without you, beloved."

145
00:11:16,582 --> 00:11:23,248
"Your lover is lonely without you,
beloved."

146
00:11:23,332 --> 00:11:29,082
"Your lover is lonely without you,
beloved."

147
00:11:29,415 --> 00:11:35,748
"I've gone crazy, Oh, Lord."

148
00:11:35,832 --> 00:11:42,165
"I've gone crazy, dear, without you."

149
00:11:42,248 --> 00:11:48,123
"Your lover is lonely without you,
beloved."

150
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:53,832
"Your lover is lonely without you,
beloved."

151
00:11:53,915 --> 00:11:59,248
"Your lover is lonely without you,
beloved."

152
00:12:16,957 --> 00:12:22,915
"How do people live like this?"

153
00:12:22,998 --> 00:12:28,915
"I'm suffering after
being separated from you."

154
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:33,498
"How do people like this.."

155
00:12:34,873 --> 00:12:36,498
"How do people.."

156
00:12:40,665 --> 00:12:46,207
"How do people live like this?"

157
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:52,290
"I'm suffering after
being separated from you."

158
00:12:52,373 --> 00:12:57,207
"I can't pass the
night in loneliness."

159
00:12:58,165 --> 00:13:03,373
"I can't spend.."

160
00:13:03,998 --> 00:13:09,248
"I can't spend it without you,
beloved."

161
00:13:09,748 --> 00:13:15,373
"Your lover is lonely without you,
beloved."

162
00:13:15,457 --> 00:13:21,082
"Your lover is lonely without you,
beloved."

163
00:13:21,165 --> 00:13:29,165
"Your lover is lonely without you,
beloved."

164
00:13:32,748 --> 00:13:40,748
"Your lover is lonely without you,
beloved."

165
00:13:50,123 --> 00:13:55,665
"Your lover is lonely without you,
beloved."

166
00:13:55,748 --> 00:14:01,207
"Your lover is lonely without you,
beloved."

167
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:03,998
- Very good.
- Very good.

168
00:14:06,082 --> 00:14:07,998
Hurry up.

169
00:14:13,123 --> 00:14:15,665
Aunt, it's fallen here.

170
00:14:16,165 --> 00:14:19,540
Aunt, let's have one more folk song.

171
00:14:19,623 --> 00:14:21,498
Not a folk song, but classical one.

172
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,082
Yes. One song more.

173
00:14:23,165 --> 00:14:25,832
Yes, Madam. Let's have another song.

174
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:29,040
Yes. It'll surely take place.

175
00:14:29,123 --> 00:14:31,123
But after you leave.

176
00:14:31,207 --> 00:14:33,165
What are you saying, sir?

177
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:36,248
Every interested person
is invited to this gathering.

178
00:14:36,332 --> 00:14:39,790
Sir, I do not know much Urdu.

179
00:14:39,873 --> 00:14:44,623
It's simple. Do not stand
up without a smile or else..

180
00:14:44,707 --> 00:14:47,665
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

181
00:14:47,748 --> 00:14:48,748
Stand up.

182
00:14:49,373 --> 00:14:51,373
Sit down, Nabob.

183
00:14:51,707 --> 00:14:53,748
I told you to stand up.

184
00:14:53,832 --> 00:14:55,123
I told you to sit down.

185
00:14:55,207 --> 00:14:57,873
- We'll hear this last song alone.
- Yes.

186
00:14:57,957 --> 00:14:59,498
Stand up quietly. Stand up.

187
00:14:59,582 --> 00:15:02,832
Don't do sit-ups.
I told you to sit down.

188
00:15:03,332 --> 00:15:04,665
He won't go out.

189
00:15:04,748 --> 00:15:06,665
We'll make him.

190
00:15:06,748 --> 00:15:09,207
- Forget it.
- What are you doing?

191
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:11,957
What are you doing?

192
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,957
Sit, Nabob. Tall fellow..

193
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,832
- What are you doing, Aunt.
- You scoundrels.

194
00:15:18,998 --> 00:15:20,332
Jhumroo.

195
00:15:20,415 --> 00:15:23,915
What are you doing? Don't be insolent.

196
00:15:25,623 --> 00:15:28,248
Come out.
I'll teach you a lesson, fool.

197
00:15:28,332 --> 00:15:31,915
Go. I've seen many loafers like you.

198
00:15:31,998 --> 00:15:33,707
He acts smart.

199
00:15:36,582 --> 00:15:44,582
- "When the ring tinkles, it's delightful.."
- Quiet.

200
00:15:45,665 --> 00:15:49,123
Shreenath. Take off the shoes.

201
00:15:50,915 --> 00:15:54,665
Vicky, shall I go?

202
00:15:54,998 --> 00:15:57,082
- Okay.
- Okay.

203
00:15:57,707 --> 00:16:01,123
How will you go?

204
00:16:01,832 --> 00:16:03,915
Why? In a taxi.

205
00:16:04,915 --> 00:16:06,332
No.

206
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:07,790
No.

207
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:11,123
I'll not let you go by a taxi.

208
00:16:11,207 --> 00:16:13,332
Then what should I do? Walk.

209
00:16:13,415 --> 00:16:17,165
Why? Am I dead?

210
00:16:17,248 --> 00:16:20,707
- I'll drop you.
- No. Never.

211
00:16:20,873 --> 00:16:23,498
I know after dropping
me you'll drive back..

212
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,498
At a speed of 80 miles..

213
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:30,123
And I'll worry whether
you've reached home or not.

214
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:32,373
And I don't even have a telephone.

215
00:16:33,665 --> 00:16:37,373
- Don't you have a telephone?
- No.

216
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,498
One minute.

217
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:44,540
One minute.

218
00:16:44,582 --> 00:16:47,165
- Vicky.
- One..

219
00:16:47,248 --> 00:16:49,832
Vicky. What are you doing?

220
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:51,665
Take this telephone.

221
00:16:51,748 --> 00:16:56,540
Vicky, keep this phone down.

222
00:16:58,707 --> 00:17:00,498
- Go to sleep.
- Yes.

223
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,207
- Go to sleep.
- Yes.

224
00:17:02,373 --> 00:17:04,582
All right. I'll sleep.

225
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:11,290
Mother, will worry all night. Let her.

226
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,373
- She's a mother.
- Yes.

227
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,498
No. This is very bad.

228
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,707
- Mother will worry?
- Yes.

229
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:23,582
So I'll tell Mother and return.

230
00:17:23,873 --> 00:17:24,873
- Yes.
- Yes.

231
00:17:25,498 --> 00:17:28,790
You go and tell Mother.
She'll worry. I'm sleeping.

232
00:17:30,707 --> 00:17:33,415
That's like a good boy.

233
00:17:34,248 --> 00:17:37,165
- So, shall I go?
- Yes.

234
00:17:37,498 --> 00:17:38,498
- Okay?
- Okay.

235
00:17:41,332 --> 00:17:46,540
- How will you go?
- In a taxi.

236
00:17:46,707 --> 00:17:47,915
No.

237
00:17:48,623 --> 00:17:52,290
I'll not let you go in a taxi.

238
00:17:52,373 --> 00:17:55,915
- I'll drop you.
- We've come to the same point.

239
00:17:55,998 --> 00:17:58,457
Okay. I'll not go. Go to sleep.

240
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:01,790
No, it's very bad.

241
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,540
Mother will worry. You go.

242
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:08,165
I'm sleeping. Go.

243
00:18:16,373 --> 00:18:18,290
How will you go?

244
00:18:19,957 --> 00:18:21,415
Am I dead?

245
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:43,915
Mother.

246
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:46,540
Mother.

247
00:18:47,457 --> 00:18:50,332
- You've come, son?
- Why are you sleeping here?

248
00:18:50,415 --> 00:18:52,582
I was waiting for you.

249
00:18:52,665 --> 00:18:55,832
I've told you often
not to wait for me at night.

250
00:18:56,332 --> 00:18:58,498
Go to sleep.

251
00:18:58,707 --> 00:19:00,540
Won't you eat food?

252
00:19:00,623 --> 00:19:03,165
No, I have already eaten.

253
00:19:04,123 --> 00:19:05,748
All right.

254
00:19:06,207 --> 00:19:07,498
Brother.

255
00:19:10,748 --> 00:19:12,957
You refuse so easily.

256
00:19:13,165 --> 00:19:15,207
Mother had made sweets for you today.

257
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:17,915
She kept missing you.

258
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:21,332
Mother made sweets today?

259
00:19:21,582 --> 00:19:24,832
Mother, you've made sweets?

260
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:27,790
- Will you eat?
- I'll eat a full bowl.

261
00:19:28,165 --> 00:19:31,707
And go to sleep. Send it with Sarla.

264
00:20:00,915 --> 00:20:03,415
- Will you have it or shall I throw it?
- What do you mean?

265
00:20:03,873 --> 00:20:05,558
Will this sweet taste
nice when you have it?

266
00:20:05,582 --> 00:20:09,082
I had asked for it,
to eat it, not throw it away.

267
00:20:09,165 --> 00:20:12,457
I thought you asked
for it to please mother.

268
00:20:12,707 --> 00:20:15,498
You've only this much
relationship with us.

269
00:20:16,332 --> 00:20:18,582
Why are you so rude?

270
00:20:18,707 --> 00:20:21,832
Brother, maybe Mother can't tell you.

271
00:20:22,123 --> 00:20:24,832
But today I'm telling
you what's in her heart.

272
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:27,165
If you can, please start working.

273
00:20:27,415 --> 00:20:29,540
Bear the expenses of our house.

274
00:20:30,915 --> 00:20:33,332
It's not nice living
off Vikram's money.

275
00:20:33,415 --> 00:20:35,332
You've gone crazy.

276
00:20:35,415 --> 00:20:38,790
He's like me.
He's more than a brother.

277
00:20:40,248 --> 00:20:42,123
He's dearer to me than my own life.

278
00:20:42,415 --> 00:20:45,457
If he spends on us,
what is so bad about it?

279
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,183
Doesn't he consider
Mother as his own Mother?

280
00:20:47,207 --> 00:20:50,457
- Doesn't he love you as a sister?
- I understand this.

281
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:54,207
But by this,
we can't stop people from taunting.

282
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:55,998
Let them talk.
I don't care about people.

283
00:20:56,082 --> 00:20:59,832
But when people say
your brother is a stooge..

284
00:20:59,915 --> 00:21:02,915
Yes, I am. I'm not their stooge.

285
00:21:02,998 --> 00:21:04,832
Why do you listen to them?

286
00:21:05,082 --> 00:21:09,457
Go to sleep. Go.

287
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,998

To me, you're the best singer.

- No, don't say that.
- Why?

you call the same day?

- What happened to father?
- This bloody manager, he's a..

Father had an heart attack
three days back. He phoned today.

337
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:24,665
He says, father had
said not to inform. Fool.

338
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,873
Whose father is he? His or mine?

339
00:25:29,207 --> 00:25:32,457
- Call the airport.
- Vicky, don't worry.

He's fine. There is nothing to worry.

You'd be upset,
so he had told me not to tell you.

- It happened ten days ago.
- Ten?

What's all this?

346
00:26:07,915 --> 00:26:09,832

it has been ten days.

What would you've
done on getting the news?

350
00:26:14,748 --> 00:26:16,873
So, why did you even call me today?

351
00:26:17,207 --> 00:26:18,933
And why did Dhupia
say it happened yesterday?

00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,290
Sit down, my dear boy.

354
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,373
Don't get excited.

355
00:26:26,332 --> 00:26:29,998
Doctors say there are many
reasons for a heart attack.

356
00:26:30,415 --> 00:26:32,540
And one of them is excitement.

357
00:26:33,165 --> 00:26:36,165
Listen. Get your
blood pressure checked.

358
00:26:36,665 --> 00:26:38,058
My blood pressure is perfectly fine.

359
00:26:38,082 --> 00:26:39,998
Then, where have your manners gone?

360
00:26:40,082 --> 00:26:41,582
You came and didn't even wish Nisha.

361
00:26:42,957 --> 00:26:43,790
Hello, Nisha.

362
00:26:43,873 --> 00:26:44,873
Hello, Vicky.

363
00:26:47,415 --> 00:26:50,373
- How is Father?
- Fine.

364
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:55,123
And how are you?

365
00:26:55,623 --> 00:26:57,123
I'm very fine. Thank you.

366
00:27:00,582 --> 00:27:02,873
- That's it?
- What else should I say?

367
00:27:02,957 --> 00:27:05,957
She'll start lecturing on socialism,
communism and politics.

368
00:27:07,332 --> 00:27:10,040
You hate talks about socialism.

369
00:27:10,123 --> 00:27:13,457
Yes, especially from
a millionaire's daughter.

370
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:17,582
If I can get socialism with my
millions, I'll surely give them away.

371
00:27:17,998 --> 00:27:19,790
But socialism is a system..

372
00:27:19,873 --> 00:27:21,790
Did you see? The lecture has started.

373
00:27:22,373 --> 00:27:25,332
But Nisha,
I can't understand one thing.

374
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:27,873
Why should we give our millions?

375
00:27:28,582 --> 00:27:31,540
God has given us some
brains and some strength.

376
00:27:31,582 --> 00:27:33,082
He has not made everyone the same.

377
00:27:33,165 --> 00:27:34,915
Correct. Now answer me.

378
00:27:35,123 --> 00:27:37,498
Uncle, Vicky hasn't changed at all.

379
00:27:37,915 --> 00:27:40,582
Vicky? Somu here.

380
00:27:40,957 --> 00:27:43,498
How is father? Any problems?

381
00:27:43,582 --> 00:27:45,123
No. Nothing to worry about.

382
00:27:45,207 --> 00:27:47,457
- Out of danger?
- Yes, everything is fine.

383
00:27:47,748 --> 00:27:50,123
When will you return?

384
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:53,040
Without you,
Delhi is like a jail, friend.

385
00:27:53,207 --> 00:27:55,207
I'll be back in a few days. Okay?

386
00:27:55,498 --> 00:27:57,415
Somu, do you want anything from here?

387
00:27:57,623 --> 00:27:59,540
Ask Mother and then call me. Okay?

388
00:28:02,665 --> 00:28:07,790
Dad. I think it's very
difficult to think about it.

389
00:28:08,207 --> 00:28:10,915
I mean I wanted to think,
but I could not think.

390
00:28:11,165 --> 00:28:13,248
- What?
- Decision.

391
00:28:13,415 --> 00:28:17,873
Dad, can't I be on both sides?

392
00:28:23,623 --> 00:28:24,998
I'm thinking the same too.

393
00:28:26,415 --> 00:28:28,498
Actually, my attack was a minor one.

394
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:30,224
Yet, these stupid
doctors tell me not to..

395
00:28:30,248 --> 00:28:32,415
Go to office for
the next two months.

396
00:28:33,582 --> 00:28:36,165
Now, until I don't go to office, you..

397
00:28:36,248 --> 00:28:38,332
What are you saying, Dad?
What will I do there?

398
00:28:38,415 --> 00:28:40,040
What do I know about business?

399
00:28:40,123 --> 00:28:42,582
In two days,
they'll realise I'm a fool.

400
00:28:42,873 --> 00:28:44,498
Two days?

401
00:28:45,207 --> 00:28:48,832
Uncle, is your staff so dumb?

402
00:28:48,998 --> 00:28:50,790
(Laughing)

403
00:28:51,415 --> 00:28:55,540
Vicky, when my Father
told me about business..

404
00:28:55,748 --> 00:28:56,998
My reply was the same.

405
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:01,582
But in a few days I found out,
business is a lot of fun.

406
00:29:01,623 --> 00:29:04,707
- I'm sure, you'll also know in seven days..
- No, Dad.

407
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:06,832
This won't happen with me.

408
00:29:07,082 --> 00:29:08,873
All right.
Go to office tomorrow morning.

409
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,290
And listen. If you get bored..

410
00:29:12,165 --> 00:29:13,790
Look at this photograph and think..

411
00:29:13,873 --> 00:29:16,707
How he could have started
this business with Rs.200.

412
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:19,498
Wow. Only Rs.200?

413
00:29:21,248 --> 00:29:22,290
Great man.

414
00:29:33,582 --> 00:29:34,665
Mr. Vikram.

415
00:29:34,748 --> 00:29:38,748
Mr. Dhupia, my Grandfather
does not look like my Father.

416
00:29:39,332 --> 00:29:42,290
These are some papers. Sign on them.

417
00:29:42,373 --> 00:29:43,623
- Why?
- What?

418
00:29:43,832 --> 00:29:45,873
Why should I sign?
I haven't signed anything before.

419
00:29:45,957 --> 00:29:48,957
Now, you'll do it.
You're the Mill partner.

420
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,498
Who are the other partners?

421
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:54,248
Your other partner is your Father.

422
00:29:54,832 --> 00:29:56,082
Okay.

423
00:29:56,582 --> 00:29:59,832
- So, can I talk to my other partner?
- Sure.

424
00:30:01,998 --> 00:30:03,623
Get me my residence please.

425
00:30:05,623 --> 00:30:07,498
Dad. Vicky.

426
00:30:08,207 --> 00:30:11,165
Mr. Dhupia has got
some papers to be signed.

427
00:30:11,373 --> 00:30:12,582
Shall I sign them?

428
00:30:12,873 --> 00:30:14,373
Sure, son.

429
00:30:14,748 --> 00:30:16,082
But remember one thing.

430
00:30:16,665 --> 00:30:19,373
Without reading, never sign any paper.

431
00:30:19,457 --> 00:30:21,957
But there are many papers, Dad.
So many..

432
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,332
Do I've to read them all?

433
00:30:25,498 --> 00:30:28,248
You never read in college.
At least read now.

434
00:30:29,665 --> 00:30:30,665
Okay.

435
00:30:32,123 --> 00:30:33,498
Dad has tricked me.

436
00:30:33,707 --> 00:30:35,623
You all are trying to trap me.

437
00:30:36,123 --> 00:30:37,915
- Where do I sign?
- Here.

438
00:30:38,957 --> 00:30:41,498
- Have you checked them?
- Properly.

439
00:30:41,665 --> 00:30:43,207
- So, shall I sign?
- Yes.

440
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:48,457
- Bipin Lal?
- Yes.

441
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:50,790
Call him fast.
Why did you make him stand outside?

442
00:30:50,957 --> 00:30:53,790
- Who is Bipin Lal?
- He's a batch clerk here.

443
00:30:53,873 --> 00:30:56,748
Batch clerk?
Then why are you so worried.

444
00:30:57,082 --> 00:30:59,707
- Hello, Mr. Dhupia.
- Hello, Mr. Bipin Lal. Come.

445
00:31:00,165 --> 00:31:01,457
Sit.

446
00:31:01,873 --> 00:31:04,665
Mr. Dhupia,
Babban's case hasn't been decided yet.

447
00:31:04,748 --> 00:31:06,558
It'll be decided in a day or two, Mr.
Bipin Lal.

448
00:31:06,582 --> 00:31:09,623
Since two months you have
been saying that. What is this?

449
00:31:09,832 --> 00:31:11,665
The decision should
be made by tomorrow or..

450
00:31:11,748 --> 00:31:12,832
Who is Babban?

451
00:31:12,915 --> 00:31:14,707
He's a worker at our Mill.

452
00:31:14,915 --> 00:31:16,332
He lost his hand in our machine.

453
00:31:16,415 --> 00:31:18,415
The Union is asking for compensation.

454
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,373
- Who had placed the hand in the machine?
- What?

455
00:31:21,748 --> 00:31:23,391
Did I place the hand
in the machine or did you?

456
00:31:23,415 --> 00:31:24,748
Compensation for what?

457
00:31:26,457 --> 00:31:30,582
He too hadn't placed
the hand in the machine.

458
00:31:31,457 --> 00:31:33,123
You're the boss, so it's your duty..

459
00:31:33,207 --> 00:31:35,290
Do not teach me my duty.

460
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:42,873
The Union has been requesting
for the past two months.

461
00:31:43,373 --> 00:31:45,290
Decide this matter fast.

462
00:31:45,373 --> 00:31:47,748
First you want alms,
and you threaten too.

463
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:52,540
It's not a threat, it's a warning.

464
00:31:55,873 --> 00:31:57,123
Get out.

465
00:31:58,123 --> 00:31:59,623
I said, get out.

466
00:32:08,832 --> 00:32:11,082
- What did you do, Mr. Vikram?
- What?

467
00:32:11,373 --> 00:32:13,457
- Mr. Bipin Lal is the Union Leader.
- So what?

468
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:15,373
You can't beg at the point of a gun.

469
00:32:15,457 --> 00:32:17,540
Don't give too much
importance to a servant.

470
00:32:17,582 --> 00:32:19,623
It's not so, Mr. Vikram.

471
00:32:19,707 --> 00:32:21,332
They'll go on a strike right now.

472
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:33,540
No. You didn't do
the right thing, Vicky.

473
00:32:33,623 --> 00:32:35,665
In your anger you've
done a foolish act.

474
00:32:35,998 --> 00:32:39,790
- Foolishness? A mere clerk threatens me and you..
- Vicky.

475
00:32:41,207 --> 00:32:43,498
In business you can't get angry.

476
00:32:43,623 --> 00:32:45,082
There is a struggle..

477
00:32:45,707 --> 00:32:48,082
Going on since ages
between these two groups.

478
00:32:48,707 --> 00:32:49,873
And it'll continue.

479
00:32:50,998 --> 00:32:54,540
To win it, you'll have to
think of new solutions every day.

480
00:32:54,832 --> 00:32:56,457
You'll have to find out new ways.

481
00:32:57,415 --> 00:32:59,290
And this is the actual challenge.

482
00:33:00,207 --> 00:33:04,248
If you're clever,
you'll keep getting work out of them..

483
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:07,165
And you'll not let them unite.

484
00:33:07,582 --> 00:33:09,873
It's a very thrilling game,
my dear son.

485
00:33:10,332 --> 00:33:12,832
Play it and see. You'll be addicted.

486
00:33:13,707 --> 00:33:16,415
As for now apologise
to Bipin Lal tomorrow.

487
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,040
What? Apologise?

488
00:33:19,123 --> 00:33:22,582
When you're sick you take medicines.

489
00:33:22,665 --> 00:33:26,373
Why? To cure the illness.

490
00:33:26,998 --> 00:33:31,207
Apologise, to take revenge
from Bipin Lal in future.

491
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:34,290
Then, I'll consider you my son.

492
00:33:34,957 --> 00:33:36,165
Go.

493
00:33:37,457 --> 00:33:39,165
Go and do as I say.

494
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:41,540
And listen.

495
00:33:44,582 --> 00:33:49,707
The humiliation you
feel while apologising..

496
00:33:51,582 --> 00:33:53,207
Shouldn't be forgotten.

497
00:33:54,623 --> 00:33:56,290
That will be your strength.

498
00:34:07,373 --> 00:34:08,498
Yes, sir.

499
00:34:10,498 --> 00:34:14,290
Jay Singh, keep a watch on Vicky.

500
00:34:15,123 --> 00:34:16,415
No one should harm him.

501
00:34:16,498 --> 00:34:17,957
Don't worry.

502
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:21,665
Till I'm alive no one
could harm junior boss.

503
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:26,790
Here.

504
00:34:42,706 --> 00:34:44,622
Forget yesterday's incident.

505
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:48,832
I'm sorry.

506
00:34:52,165 --> 00:34:53,873
Vicky apologised.

507
00:34:54,623 --> 00:34:55,873
Good.

508
00:34:56,665 --> 00:34:58,082
Is he very upset?

509
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:03,207
Dhupia, book a seat
for him for Delhi today.

510
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:06,415
And tell him I told him
to go to Delhi for a few days.

511
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,707
Brother, brother Vikram has come.

512
00:35:20,332 --> 00:35:22,332
Vicky? Who told you?

513
00:35:22,748 --> 00:35:24,332
He's upstairs in your room.

514
00:35:25,165 --> 00:35:28,040
He's very sad.

515
00:35:28,123 --> 00:35:29,391
Surely, something bad has happened

516
00:35:29,415 --> 00:35:30,790
Sad?

517
00:35:36,165 --> 00:35:38,790
- Vicky, when did you come?
- By the last flight.

518
00:35:38,873 --> 00:35:41,498
- How is Father?
- He's fine now.

519
00:35:43,707 --> 00:35:46,665
What happened?
Have you fought with Father?

520
00:35:48,998 --> 00:35:50,623
Tell me.

521
00:35:51,915 --> 00:35:55,665
- There was a fight, with a pimp.
- A pimp?

522
00:35:55,748 --> 00:35:57,832
Yes, a pimp. Of the workers.

523
00:35:57,915 --> 00:36:00,082
Union Leader. A worker in our Mill.

524
00:36:02,582 --> 00:36:05,873
So you ran away from Bombay?
Afraid of a worker?

525
00:36:07,207 --> 00:36:08,540
Your state is like the one..

526
00:36:08,582 --> 00:36:10,040
Who has over-powered the enemy..

527
00:36:10,123 --> 00:36:13,165
- But is afraid of his next move.
- Oh, stop it.

528
00:36:15,873 --> 00:36:16,873
Sorry.

529
00:36:17,665 --> 00:36:18,873
What happened?

530
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:22,082
Tell me.

531
00:36:26,123 --> 00:36:29,915
He's a mere worker and I
had to apologise to him in writing.

532
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:31,665
Apologise?

533
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:34,290
Who told you to apologise?

534
00:36:34,582 --> 00:36:38,457
Dad. A worker lost
his hand in a machine.

535
00:36:38,665 --> 00:36:40,332
Tell me, was it my fault?

536
00:36:40,415 --> 00:36:41,540
Was it my fault?

537
00:36:42,248 --> 00:36:46,207
Tell me everything. Come here.

538
00:36:50,832 --> 00:36:51,832
Then?

539
00:36:52,457 --> 00:36:57,457
That's it. About this I had
a fight with Pandey, that Union man.

540
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:01,457
The workers went on strike
and I had to apologise to him.

541
00:37:02,832 --> 00:37:06,207
And now I'll have to
go to office every day.

542
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:09,373
I'll have to face the
man before whom I had begged.

543
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:10,915
Scum.

544
00:37:10,998 --> 00:37:13,165
I'll destroy him,
Somu, I'll finish him.

545
00:37:13,457 --> 00:37:15,873
How long does it take to finish a man?

546
00:37:16,123 --> 00:37:17,540
Just give anyone Rs.500, that's it.

547
00:37:17,582 --> 00:37:20,123
No, Somu. I do not want to kill him.

548
00:37:20,665 --> 00:37:23,540
I want to finish him off.
Wipe him off.

549
00:37:25,082 --> 00:37:26,248
Tell me what to do?

550
00:37:30,123 --> 00:37:31,332
Vicky.

551
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:34,623
I want to go to Bombay with you.

552
00:37:35,582 --> 00:37:37,748
Will you come really?

553
00:37:37,832 --> 00:37:39,165
Give me a job.

554
00:37:39,248 --> 00:37:42,290
Don't worry.
I'll arrange for a manager's job.

555
00:37:42,373 --> 00:37:43,582
No, of a worker.

556
00:37:44,165 --> 00:37:45,165
What?

557
00:37:50,332 --> 00:37:52,832
Brother, this is the new boss.

558
00:38:07,832 --> 00:38:09,123
Salutations, Sir.

559
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:24,165
- Who is he?
- Who?

560
00:38:24,415 --> 00:38:25,790
The one with the band on the head?

561
00:38:25,957 --> 00:38:28,290
Chander. A new apprentice.

562
00:38:28,748 --> 00:38:32,457
- Who has hired him?
- The manager, not me.

563
00:38:32,665 --> 00:38:34,207
Someone recommended him.

564
00:38:34,582 --> 00:38:36,957
But he's a good worker.
He'll learn the work.

565
00:38:38,623 --> 00:38:40,790
Not only work,
teach him how to greet too.

566
00:38:46,748 --> 00:38:49,582
- Chander.
- What is it?

567
00:38:49,665 --> 00:38:51,082
Don't you know him?

568
00:38:51,582 --> 00:38:53,415
- Who?
- The one who just left.

569
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:55,748
He's our boss. Sir's son.

570
00:38:55,832 --> 00:38:57,998
- So?
- Why didn't you greet him?

571
00:38:58,082 --> 00:39:00,290
Will I get paid for
work or for greeting him?

572
00:39:00,373 --> 00:39:01,832
You'll die. You'll lose your job.

573
00:39:01,915 --> 00:39:03,165
Go, do your work.

574
00:39:03,332 --> 00:39:04,707
Fool.

575
00:39:07,998 --> 00:39:09,540
Do it fast. Why are you taking time?

576
00:39:09,832 --> 00:39:11,957
- I'm doing it, artisan.
- Do it.

577
00:39:12,873 --> 00:39:14,373
I do not understand anything.

578
00:39:14,707 --> 00:39:15,540
First, you said you'll
work in the Mill.

579
00:39:15,623 --> 00:39:17,641
Now, you're staying in the colony.
What is all this?

580
00:39:17,665 --> 00:39:21,623
Vicky, tell me from your heart..

581
00:39:21,915 --> 00:39:24,915
Do you want to take
revenge on Bipin Lal or not?

582
00:39:26,082 --> 00:39:27,957
I want to take revenge..

583
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:30,915
Honestly, Somu.

584
00:39:31,582 --> 00:39:35,540
Finishing Bipin Lal is
the biggest aim in my life.

585
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:37,915
I'm afraid to set foot in the Mill.

586
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:40,540
If he comes in front,
I change my ways.

587
00:39:41,498 --> 00:39:43,165
I feel like..

588
00:39:43,582 --> 00:39:45,707
You want to finish Bipin Lal.

589
00:39:46,623 --> 00:39:49,915
But do you know Bipin Lal's
position with the workers?

590
00:39:50,332 --> 00:39:54,207
- What?
- They take him to be God.

591
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:59,332
He can't be deposed.

592
00:40:00,582 --> 00:40:01,748
Then?

593
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:08,165
I'll have to become greater
than him in front of the workers.

594
00:40:08,873 --> 00:40:11,873
And for that it's important
to know them closely.

595
00:40:11,957 --> 00:40:14,540
Each one's name,
address, house and everything.

596
00:40:14,582 --> 00:40:17,207
It isn't possible without
staying with them.

597
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:20,373
Hence, I've rented
a house in the colony.

598
00:40:20,457 --> 00:40:22,248
I should not even come here.

599
00:40:22,332 --> 00:40:24,582
If anyone sees,
all our doing will go to waste.

600
00:40:24,957 --> 00:40:27,123
Who will come 20 miles
away from the Mill to see you?

601
00:40:27,207 --> 00:40:29,290
- What if someone comes?
- Don't talk nonsense.

602
00:40:29,957 --> 00:40:31,997
If you don't want to come here,
no need to go there.

603
00:40:32,123 --> 00:40:35,082
Okay, fine. I'll come late at night.

604
00:40:36,207 --> 00:40:39,832
- But friend, I can't mentally adjust all this.
- What?

605
00:40:39,915 --> 00:40:42,165
You'll have to stay in the colony.

606
00:40:42,957 --> 00:40:45,915
If you weren't my friend..

607
00:40:45,998 --> 00:40:47,790
- I'd be staying in the colony.
- Shut up.

608
00:40:47,873 --> 00:40:51,165
Now, I'll become a
leader and give speech.

609
00:40:51,415 --> 00:40:55,373
Brothers and sisters.
If a worker who doesn't work..

610
00:40:55,457 --> 00:40:58,540
For a day,
then his family starves that day.

611
00:40:58,582 --> 00:41:02,248
People of India,
open your eyes and see the truth.

612
00:41:02,332 --> 00:41:05,665
And see the poverty
strewn all around you.

613
00:41:05,873 --> 00:41:09,748
See how unhappy and helpless
the people of our country are.

614
00:41:09,998 --> 00:41:11,665
So, we'll have to fight.

615
00:41:11,832 --> 00:41:15,915
We'll have to make every poor man,
rich and every rich man, poor.

616
00:41:16,165 --> 00:41:17,373
Yes.

617
00:41:17,457 --> 00:41:21,498
And make every village
a city and every city a village.

618
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:23,290
Applause.

619
00:41:24,123 --> 00:41:25,790
Very good.
You've made a great beginning.

620
00:41:25,873 --> 00:41:28,207
This is just the beginning.
See what happens next.

621
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:29,665
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

622
00:41:46,665 --> 00:41:47,707
Are you drunk?

623
00:41:48,207 --> 00:41:50,040
It's the same thing, friend.

624
00:41:51,165 --> 00:41:54,373
Give me either a drink or sorrow.

625
00:41:55,707 --> 00:42:00,957
Liquor is drunk and
we drink tears too.

626
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,207
What? Repeat it.

627
00:42:04,082 --> 00:42:09,957
The pain of the heart
isn't repeated, friend.'

628
00:42:10,332 --> 00:42:14,873
'It's like a flame which
isn't brought to the lips again.'

629
00:42:14,957 --> 00:42:16,665
Very good.

630
00:42:16,957 --> 00:42:18,915
You're a great poet.

631
00:42:19,373 --> 00:42:20,582
What is your name?

632
00:42:20,998 --> 00:42:22,498
- Name?
- Yes.

633
00:42:23,248 --> 00:42:24,790
- Alam.
- Alam.

634
00:42:25,165 --> 00:42:27,373
Brother Alam, where do you stay?

635
00:42:29,207 --> 00:42:34,082
The road is our nest.'

636
00:42:34,165 --> 00:42:38,623
There is no house to stay,
the whole world is mine.'

637
00:42:41,582 --> 00:42:44,707
Right now beside Aunt's house..

638
00:42:45,207 --> 00:42:47,790
Who is this Aunt?
Does she sell liquor?

639
00:42:50,832 --> 00:42:53,290
Don't say that.

640
00:42:53,873 --> 00:42:56,457
The poor lady sells liquor.

641
00:42:57,165 --> 00:43:00,998
If the government comes to know,
they'll get her.

642
00:43:01,623 --> 00:43:05,540
Yes. If someone sells
hunger and thirst..

643
00:43:06,082 --> 00:43:10,290
Let it be. Shall we go
to Aunt's place for one more?

644
00:43:10,373 --> 00:43:12,248
Yes. Let's go.

645
00:43:16,332 --> 00:43:17,457
What happened?

646
00:43:18,582 --> 00:43:20,790
Let it be. Some other time.

647
00:43:21,248 --> 00:43:22,248
Why?

648
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:24,623
You've no money?

649
00:43:24,707 --> 00:43:27,957
Don't worry. I'll pay. Come.

650
00:43:28,498 --> 00:43:31,248
- Come, come.
- Come.

651
00:43:31,665 --> 00:43:35,498
Friend, there is a hole, be careful.

652
00:43:36,582 --> 00:43:41,915
One, two and three.

653
00:43:45,373 --> 00:43:48,332
- Come, friend.
- Yes.

654
00:43:50,290 --> 00:43:52,373
You've come again.

655
00:43:52,957 --> 00:43:54,790
Wait, Aunt.

656
00:43:55,582 --> 00:43:58,540
I've not come here,
I've been brought here.

657
00:43:58,623 --> 00:44:00,915
Enough. There's no need for poetry.

658
00:44:00,998 --> 00:44:07,040
I do not come here to sing poetry.

659
00:44:07,123 --> 00:44:08,832
- I want liquor.
- There isn't liquor.

660
00:44:08,915 --> 00:44:11,373
- It's not there?
- Don't say that.

661
00:44:11,457 --> 00:44:12,998
What will happen to your business?

662
00:44:13,082 --> 00:44:15,832
Business will shut down.
But you'll not get liquor.

663
00:44:15,915 --> 00:44:17,748
- I won't get it?
- No.

664
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:19,915
All right.

665
00:44:21,123 --> 00:44:24,248
- Come, friend. We'll go to Pascal.
- Yes.

666
00:44:24,332 --> 00:44:27,582
Go to Pascal's. Do you've money?

667
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:30,915
I don't have money.

668
00:44:31,373 --> 00:44:35,207
But he's wealthy. Right, friend?

669
00:44:35,290 --> 00:44:37,248
I'm asking you, not him.

670
00:44:37,332 --> 00:44:41,082
Aunt, a poor person's hunger, thirst..

671
00:44:41,165 --> 00:44:43,623
Money is all the same. Got it?

672
00:44:43,707 --> 00:44:46,165
We don't differentiate that.

673
00:44:46,248 --> 00:44:49,373
Take the money and get the liquor.

674
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:53,790
This man will also die someday. Sit.

675
00:44:55,915 --> 00:44:57,457
Come, friend.

676
00:45:04,582 --> 00:45:05,790
Did you see?

677
00:45:06,873 --> 00:45:08,873
This lady does not sell liquor.

678
00:45:09,332 --> 00:45:11,540
Since when do you know her?

679
00:45:13,582 --> 00:45:15,332
Since my last birth.

680
00:45:16,582 --> 00:45:20,415
Even in your last birth,
Aunt used to do this?

681
00:45:20,957 --> 00:45:25,540
Yes. Even then she used
to be loving like this.

682
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:30,082
First eat, then drink.

683
00:45:30,332 --> 00:45:33,248
Your eyes have become listless too.

684
00:45:33,332 --> 00:45:36,040
Son, first make him eat something.

685
00:45:36,123 --> 00:45:38,332
He does not listen.
If I stop him here..

686
00:45:38,415 --> 00:45:41,082
He will drink somewhere else.

687
00:45:41,623 --> 00:45:44,290
Son, is it?

688
00:45:45,623 --> 00:45:46,915
This is a hand bill.

689
00:45:46,998 --> 00:45:49,998
See the other side.
He was writing on this yesterday.

690
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:54,498
- Yes.
- What is written? Please read it.

691
00:45:54,665 --> 00:45:58,082
From a pond to the river,
from the river to the sea.'

692
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:00,748
A drink is deeper than the sea.'

693
00:46:01,457 --> 00:46:05,832
Every evening in my life
has been drowned in drink, pal.'

694
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:09,373
I don't know what's paining him.

695
00:46:09,957 --> 00:46:12,373
Why does he not want to live?

696
00:46:16,582 --> 00:46:21,040
In the hope of living,
people are dying.'

697
00:46:21,957 --> 00:46:26,415
In the hope of living,
people are dying.'

698
00:46:27,748 --> 00:46:31,707
In the hope of dying, I'm living.'

699
00:46:49,748 --> 00:46:50,790

00:46:56,207 --> 00:46:58,207

00:46:59,582 --> 00:47:01,123
Accident.

702
00:47:13,623 --> 00:47:14,957
Come on.

703
00:47:15,373 --> 00:47:16,832
Again someone is hurt.

704
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:19,910
It seems there is an accident
in the worker's section.

705
00:47:20,123 --> 00:47:22,498
No, the crowd is near
the machine section.

706
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:24,457
The machine section
has become unlucky.

707
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:26,821
Every month, something or
the other keeps happening there.

708
00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:36,498
(Crowd Chattering)

709
00:47:41,623 --> 00:47:42,998
What happened, Dhondu?

710
00:47:43,373 --> 00:47:44,998
Karim's hand got cut.

711
00:47:45,082 --> 00:47:47,915
- Which Karim?
- Aisha's father.

712
00:47:49,165 --> 00:47:50,540
Is he badly hurt?

713
00:47:50,748 --> 00:47:54,540
Karim got saved,
but his hand is gone forever.

714
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:56,748
God alone knows what he'll do now.

715
00:47:56,832 --> 00:48:00,998
What will he do? The Mill
will pay a few thousand rupees.

716
00:48:01,623 --> 00:48:05,040
He'll live on it as long as he has it.
Then he'll die. What else?

717
00:48:17,582 --> 00:48:19,457
- Vicky.
- Yes?

718
00:48:19,707 --> 00:48:22,498
In a way it's good
that Karim had an accident.

719
00:48:22,873 --> 00:48:24,498
Karim? Who is Karim?

720
00:48:24,915 --> 00:48:27,290
The one who lost his arm.

721
00:48:27,582 --> 00:48:30,665
You even remember the
names of the workers now.

722
00:48:31,415 --> 00:48:34,790
Vicky, these small
things are very important..

723
00:48:35,332 --> 00:48:37,248
To these small people.

724
00:48:37,707 --> 00:48:39,547
In your house there is a driver,
a laundry-man.

725
00:48:39,790 --> 00:48:41,665
Have you ever called them by names?

726
00:48:42,123 --> 00:48:44,373
Just call your driver
by his name once.

727
00:48:44,873 --> 00:48:47,415
He'll become your slave.

728
00:48:47,665 --> 00:48:50,040
It's enough that his
boss called him by his name.

729
00:48:50,498 --> 00:48:52,082
He was recognised by his name.

730
00:48:52,498 --> 00:48:55,540
Friend, you've turned
out to be a clever man.

731
00:48:55,582 --> 00:48:57,582
These are the tricks
of the trade, son.

732
00:48:58,040 --> 00:48:59,373
Take advantage of the situation.

733
00:48:59,915 --> 00:49:04,415
This hand that has been cut
isn't Karim's, but Bipin Lal's.

734
00:49:04,790 --> 00:49:05,790
How?

735
00:49:06,748 --> 00:49:07,748
I'll tell you.

736
00:49:11,123 --> 00:49:12,790
Tomorrow,
when you come to the factory..

737
00:49:15,582 --> 00:49:16,707
Sir.

738
00:49:21,748 --> 00:49:23,415
I want to talk to you.

739
00:49:28,873 --> 00:49:29,623
Yes?

740
00:49:29,707 --> 00:49:32,707
Karim's hand got cut. Do you know?

741
00:49:33,582 --> 00:49:36,123
Yes, a worker lost his hand yesterday.

742
00:49:36,207 --> 00:49:37,707
Yes. The same Karim.

743
00:49:37,915 --> 00:49:39,957
Is the value of his
hand only worth Rs.2000?

744
00:49:41,457 --> 00:49:42,516
What are you trying to say?

745
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:45,290
Karim has two small children and..

746
00:49:45,373 --> 00:49:47,498
A young daughter whom
he wants to get married.

747
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:49,415
Besides that he has
an old mother, a wife.

748
00:49:49,582 --> 00:49:51,998
And it may be two months before..

749
00:49:52,082 --> 00:49:54,242
- He returns from the hospital.
- So what should I do?

750
00:49:54,290 --> 00:49:55,683
When Karim returns, he should get..

751
00:49:55,707 --> 00:49:59,373
His job back and
Rs.5,000 should be paid..

752
00:49:59,457 --> 00:50:00,790
To his family.

753
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:03,498
Money does not grow on trees
to demand as much as you want.

754
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:05,290
Even hands don't go on trees..

755
00:50:05,373 --> 00:50:07,207
To be replaced by the other.

756
00:50:07,498 --> 00:50:10,457
- The hands that have fed you..
- Shut up.

757
00:50:11,623 --> 00:50:13,832
Nobody feeds us.

758
00:50:14,207 --> 00:50:15,748
I've done what the law says.

759
00:50:16,165 --> 00:50:19,248
I gave him Rs.2000 as per the law.

760
00:50:20,082 --> 00:50:21,748
Then remember one thing.

761
00:50:22,415 --> 00:50:24,165
You too pass from here every day.

762
00:50:24,248 --> 00:50:26,623
Someday, some part of
a machine could fall on you.

763
00:50:26,707 --> 00:50:29,040
And if unluckily
both your arms get cut..

764
00:50:29,123 --> 00:50:30,290
Don't worry.

765
00:50:30,373 --> 00:50:33,582
We all will chip in
and give you Rs.4,000.

766
00:50:33,623 --> 00:50:35,165
Are you trying to threaten me?

767
00:50:36,915 --> 00:50:38,957
I don't know about threats.

768
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:41,748
All I know is that if
Karim does not get Rs.5,000..

769
00:50:41,832 --> 00:50:43,790
You'll know the value of your arms.

770
00:50:43,998 --> 00:50:45,748
If you can, get them insured.

771
00:50:46,832 --> 00:50:49,540
You get yourself insured.
This company is responsible for you.

772
00:50:49,582 --> 00:50:52,290
Not for your family. Got it?

773
00:51:00,623 --> 00:51:03,040
What is all this?

774
00:51:03,582 --> 00:51:05,207
Move.

775
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:06,915
Why were you fighting?

776
00:51:07,207 --> 00:51:09,665
I wasn't fighting,
I was asking for a worker's right.

777
00:51:09,748 --> 00:51:11,457
This work isn't yours,
it's the Union's.

778
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:12,873
What has the Union done?

779
00:51:13,123 --> 00:51:15,415
Just got Rs.2,000 for Karim.

780
00:51:15,498 --> 00:51:16,540
It is the law.

781
00:51:16,623 --> 00:51:21,082
Who made the law? We workers?

782
00:51:21,165 --> 00:51:23,248
You think the boss will
give Rs.5,000 just like that?

783
00:51:23,332 --> 00:51:26,540
Forget the boss,
I could even fight the world..

784
00:51:26,623 --> 00:51:28,040
For the rights of the workers.

785
00:51:28,123 --> 00:51:31,748
Fight. But do it methodically.

786
00:51:32,123 --> 00:51:33,665
What is happening?

787
00:51:36,707 --> 00:51:39,123
Mr. Bipin, what is happening?

788
00:51:39,207 --> 00:51:42,165
Send the workers to work.
This isn't a break time.

789
00:51:42,248 --> 00:51:46,498
And Sir has agreed
to give Karim Rs.5,000..

790
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:48,832
And give him his job back.

791
00:51:50,332 --> 00:51:52,457
Hail brother Chander.

792
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:54,665
Hail brother Chander.

793
00:51:55,082 --> 00:51:58,373
(All Cheering)

794
00:52:07,873 --> 00:52:09,957
- It's the festival of colours.
- Give me one tea.

795
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:11,790
It's the festival of colours.

796
00:52:12,707 --> 00:52:15,498
I don't care. I don't celebrate it.

797
00:52:15,582 --> 00:52:17,623
No problem. We'll celebrate it.

798
00:52:17,957 --> 00:52:19,207
Leave me alone.

799
00:52:19,748 --> 00:52:21,957
(All Cheering)

800
00:52:26,873 --> 00:52:31,248
(Music Playing)

801
00:52:36,290 --> 00:52:38,090
Whom did you ask before
spraying colour on me?

802
00:52:38,123 --> 00:52:40,290
Stop harping.

803
00:52:41,498 --> 00:52:43,415
Move back.

804
00:52:43,623 --> 00:52:44,748
Move back.

805
00:52:44,832 --> 00:52:46,457
Why did you put colour on me?

806
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:48,474
It's a way of celebrating
the Festival of Colours.

807
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:51,832
A 22 year old woman wants
to celebrate Festival of Colours.

808
00:52:51,915 --> 00:52:55,540
Shut up. What else you do
expect me to do on this festive day?

809
00:52:55,790 --> 00:52:56,873
I'll make you celebrate.

810
00:52:56,957 --> 00:52:59,915
Go away.
Pauper, you can't do anything.

811
00:53:00,457 --> 00:53:02,540
- What did you say?
- Pauper.

812
00:53:05,998 --> 00:53:08,873
- Brother.
- Now you remembered brother?

813
00:53:08,957 --> 00:53:12,582
- Come. Let's celebrate.
- What happened, Chander?

814
00:53:12,665 --> 00:53:15,165
When I came out this girl coloured me.

815
00:53:15,248 --> 00:53:17,498
- No brother, I..
- No, brother..

816
00:53:17,790 --> 00:53:19,498
- Is she your sister?
- Yes.

817
00:53:19,790 --> 00:53:22,332
You spoilt his new shirt.

818
00:53:22,415 --> 00:53:24,766
Why did he wear it? Didn't
he know it's the Festival of Colours.

819
00:53:24,790 --> 00:53:27,207
- That it's but..
- What?

820
00:53:27,290 --> 00:53:28,748
The one who stayed here before..

821
00:53:28,832 --> 00:53:31,540
Didn't say anything when
I had poured hot soup on him..

822
00:53:31,582 --> 00:53:33,332
By mistake once.

823
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:35,540
And he acts smart.

824
00:53:35,582 --> 00:53:38,832
- No.
- She's insulting me. She called me smart.

825
00:53:38,915 --> 00:53:40,849
- No, she said that to me..
- Then it's all right.

826
00:53:40,873 --> 00:53:43,207
I'll beat you.
Did you make the intoxicating milk?

827
00:53:43,290 --> 00:53:45,123
Come. We're coming to drink. Go.

828
00:53:48,207 --> 00:53:49,082
- Chander.
- Yes?

829
00:53:49,165 --> 00:53:51,582
I'll give you the intoxicating milk.

830
00:53:51,665 --> 00:53:54,165
Is it strong and addictive?

831
00:53:54,248 --> 00:53:57,957
It's called an offering.
You'll become flat.

832
00:53:58,040 --> 00:53:59,290
What are you saying?

833
00:53:59,373 --> 00:54:00,915
- Flat.
- What?

834
00:54:01,915 --> 00:54:03,790
It's English,
you'll not understand. Come.

835
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:08,790
Come, Chander. Sit.

836
00:54:11,707 --> 00:54:14,040
Very good. You've made sweets too.

837
00:54:15,165 --> 00:54:17,040
- Have you put that in it?
- Yes.

838
00:54:17,123 --> 00:54:18,748
Then it'll be a lot of fun.

839
00:54:18,832 --> 00:54:22,373
Don't even ask. In two pieces..

840
00:54:22,957 --> 00:54:25,915
You eat only one piece.
That's enough for 24 hours.

841
00:54:25,998 --> 00:54:28,873
- Last year the way you had troubled..
- What had he done?

842
00:54:28,957 --> 00:54:30,915
What do you've to do?
Am I talking to you?

843
00:54:30,998 --> 00:54:33,832
No. Dhondu, you asked.

844
00:54:34,123 --> 00:54:35,457
What had I done?

845
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:37,332
Every year you do something new.

846
00:54:37,415 --> 00:54:39,175
Sometimes you cry and
sometimes you're happy.

847
00:54:40,332 --> 00:54:42,332
Take it, brother.
The gang is here. I'm going.

848
00:54:42,415 --> 00:54:44,332
Go. She's gone.

849
00:54:44,623 --> 00:54:45,623
Here, brother.

850
00:54:45,707 --> 00:54:46,998
Careful.

851
00:54:47,582 --> 00:54:49,832
Hail Lord Shiva.

852
00:54:52,832 --> 00:54:58,207
(Music Playing)

853
00:55:11,957 --> 00:55:14,832
"In the beauty's courtyard.."

854
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:18,957
"In the beauty's courtyard,
colours are showered."

855
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:22,332
"Red colours are sprayed everywhere."

856
00:55:22,665 --> 00:55:25,748
"Red colours are sprayed everywhere."

857
00:55:47,207 --> 00:55:48,957
"Come, dear."

858
00:55:50,665 --> 00:55:53,165
"Come and celebrate this festival."

859
00:55:54,207 --> 00:55:57,707
"Let's play with colours."

860
00:55:57,790 --> 00:56:00,957
"Let's play with colours."

861
00:56:20,290 --> 00:56:21,665
You dance very well.

862
00:56:21,748 --> 00:56:23,623
Go away. Don't flatter me.

863
00:56:23,707 --> 00:56:26,165
I'm not flattering you.
You're a genius.

864
00:56:26,248 --> 00:56:28,957
What did you say?
You're abusing me in English?

865
00:56:29,123 --> 00:56:30,498
No, I'm praising you.

866
00:56:30,582 --> 00:56:32,165
Genius isn't an abuse, fool.

867
00:56:32,248 --> 00:56:34,290
Fool? Again you abused me.

868
00:56:34,498 --> 00:56:36,498
- Do you know the meaning of a fool?
- What?

869
00:56:36,623 --> 00:56:38,040
Fool means you..

870
00:56:38,123 --> 00:56:43,165
- A beautiful girl.
- Yes, a beautiful girl.

871
00:56:43,248 --> 00:56:46,582
Why are you flattering me so much?

872
00:56:46,832 --> 00:56:51,373
Okay. You dance very badly, all right.

873
00:56:52,248 --> 00:56:55,332
Brother, again he's talking
in English and keeps saying okay.

874
00:56:55,415 --> 00:56:57,457
All right,
now forgive him, he made a mistake.

875
00:56:57,540 --> 00:57:00,998
Now go get an offering for us.

876
00:57:01,582 --> 00:57:02,582
Go.

877
00:57:03,582 --> 00:57:06,915
Dhondu, sit. I've made a drink too.

878
00:57:06,998 --> 00:57:09,998
Son, take two glasses for them.

879
00:57:10,582 --> 00:57:11,873
Dhondu, sit here.

880
00:57:13,290 --> 00:57:17,373
- Your sister is innocent.
- After all whose sister is she?

881
00:57:17,457 --> 00:57:20,248
- She's just like a child.
- Whose sister is she?

882
00:57:20,332 --> 00:57:22,623
- She's a little idiot.
- Whose sister is..

883
00:57:23,957 --> 00:57:25,332
(Laughing)

884
00:57:28,373 --> 00:57:30,248
Dhondu, take it.

885
00:57:30,582 --> 00:57:32,873
Hail Lord Shiva.

886
00:57:32,957 --> 00:57:34,290
Drink it.

887
00:57:35,873 --> 00:57:40,748
(Music Playing)

888
00:57:53,332 --> 00:57:55,665
"From the pond to the river."

889
00:57:57,623 --> 00:58:00,332
"From the river to the sea."

890
00:58:01,832 --> 00:58:06,165
"Drink is deeper than the sea."

891
00:58:06,248 --> 00:58:09,248
"Drink is deeper than the sea."

892
00:58:10,290 --> 00:58:18,290
"Every evening of my
life is drowned in drink."

893
00:58:18,707 --> 00:58:21,540
"From the pond to the river."

894
00:58:22,915 --> 00:58:25,165
"From the river to the sea."

895
00:58:27,123 --> 00:58:31,207
"The drink is deeper than the sea."

896
00:58:31,290 --> 00:58:34,498
"The drink is deeper than the sea."

897
00:58:34,582 --> 00:58:42,582
"Every evening of my
life is drowned in drink."

898
00:59:00,748 --> 00:59:07,415
"Those who don't drink
won't know why we drink."

899
00:59:09,248 --> 00:59:15,582
"After learning to drink
we've learnt to live and die."

900
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:22,832
"Those who don't drink
won't know why we drink."

901
00:59:25,915 --> 00:59:32,165
"After learning to drink
we've learnt to live and die."

902
00:59:34,207 --> 00:59:41,373
"When we started staggering,
intoxicated.."

903
00:59:42,290 --> 00:59:50,290
"My heart got a little peace."

904
00:59:50,832 --> 00:59:53,415
"From the pond to the river."

905
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:57,207
"From the river to the sea."

906
00:59:59,290 --> 01:00:03,332
"Drink is deeper than the sea."

907
01:00:03,415 --> 01:00:07,457
"Drink is deeper than the sea."

908
01:00:24,498 --> 01:00:31,082
"Forget me. I'm sad and intoxicated."

909
01:00:32,957 --> 01:00:39,248
"Some have the intoxication of wealth,
some of love, friend."

910
01:00:41,290 --> 01:00:48,415
"Everyone calls me a drunk."

911
01:00:49,540 --> 01:00:57,540
"But I was someone else earlier."

912
01:00:57,748 --> 01:01:00,290
"From the pond to the river."

913
01:01:02,082 --> 01:01:04,748
"From the river to the sea."

914
01:01:06,165 --> 01:01:10,290
"Drink is deeper than the sea."

915
01:01:10,373 --> 01:01:13,498
"Drink is deeper than the sea."

916
01:01:14,415 --> 01:01:22,415
"Every evening of my
life is drowned in drink."

917
01:01:22,707 --> 01:01:28,498
"Every evening of my
life is drowned in drink."

918
01:01:30,123 --> 01:01:32,123
- Friend. - Give me the bottle.
- Here.

919
01:01:32,207 --> 01:01:34,123
What is this? Liquor after cannabis.

920
01:01:34,207 --> 01:01:35,998
Watch the fun.

921
01:01:37,540 --> 01:01:39,582
It's so much fun.

922
01:01:39,665 --> 01:01:41,748
(Laughing)

923
01:01:43,915 --> 01:01:47,540
Bholu, it's stuck. It won't open.

924
01:01:51,790 --> 01:01:54,082
I told you not to have
a drink over cannabis.

925
01:01:54,290 --> 01:01:56,415
Now, you've become stoned.

926
01:02:00,207 --> 01:02:03,748
Quiet. Quiet. Quiet.

927
01:02:15,790 --> 01:02:16,790
Shridhar.

928
01:02:19,082 --> 01:02:20,498
- Shridhar.
- Yes, sir?

929
01:02:22,998 --> 01:02:24,582
- Do you've any dirty sheets?
- What?

930
01:02:24,873 --> 01:02:26,498
- Dirty sheets.
- Dirty sheets?

931
01:02:26,582 --> 01:02:28,415
- Yes.
- Yes. - Get it.

932
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:34,040
(Laughing)

933
01:02:36,957 --> 01:02:39,373
Again air has been filled up.
I've become a balloon.

934
01:02:39,457 --> 01:02:41,498
Hold me. I'm flying.

935
01:02:41,582 --> 01:02:44,332
Leave him. Let him go out of the roof.

936
01:02:44,415 --> 01:02:46,540
Hold me.

937
01:02:48,582 --> 01:02:49,873
What has happened to you?

938
01:02:49,957 --> 01:02:52,498
Brother is drunk,
but are you possessed to shout.

939
01:02:53,207 --> 01:02:56,873
They've made me drink.
Now they will fly with me.

940
01:02:57,790 --> 01:03:00,165
All right. Take this medicine.

941
01:03:01,165 --> 01:03:04,165
- Give it to him too.
- To whom?

942
01:03:05,123 --> 01:03:07,165
What is Chander's name?

943
01:03:07,332 --> 01:03:10,415
Go ask Chander's name
and give it to him too.

944
01:03:15,498 --> 01:03:17,332
(Laughing)

945
01:03:19,957 --> 01:03:23,457
Again air has been filled up.
Hold me. I've become a balloon.

946
01:03:23,540 --> 01:03:25,123
Hold it. Wait.

947
01:03:30,082 --> 01:03:32,623
Chandu, don't cry.

948
01:03:32,707 --> 01:03:36,415
What should I do?
What if fingers aren't freed?

949
01:03:36,498 --> 01:03:39,082
They'll surely get
freed by tomorrow morning.

950
01:03:42,248 --> 01:03:44,540
- My fingers.
- What happened?

951
01:03:44,582 --> 01:03:47,207
- They're stuck.
- Show me.

952
01:03:50,082 --> 01:03:51,665
- Have they opened?
- Yes.

953
01:03:51,748 --> 01:03:54,207
Friend they have opened.
You all may go now.

954
01:03:58,123 --> 01:03:59,790
Very good.

955
01:04:00,915 --> 01:04:03,207
- So what was I saying?
- Nothing.

956
01:04:03,832 --> 01:04:04,957
Then what were you saying?

957
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:08,457
- I was saying eat this and go to sleep.
- Yes.

958
01:04:08,957 --> 01:04:12,998
I was saying whatever you
tell me to eat and I'll eat it.

959
01:04:13,082 --> 01:04:15,415
Even if you give
me poison I'll eat it.

960
01:04:15,873 --> 01:04:17,582
What else is there to eat?

961
01:04:17,832 --> 01:04:19,582
Are there any sweets?

962
01:04:19,832 --> 01:04:21,457
First, eat this.

963
01:04:23,707 --> 01:04:27,998
- What happened?
- Look, my hands are stuck on my knees.

964
01:04:31,082 --> 01:04:32,832
Why did they get stuck?

965
01:04:34,665 --> 01:04:36,498
What now? Why are you laughing?

966
01:04:36,582 --> 01:04:39,707
- My hand is now stuck to your friend.
- No.

967
01:04:45,665 --> 01:04:47,748
You're very beautiful.

968
01:04:49,248 --> 01:04:52,373
Say it in English.

969
01:04:53,623 --> 01:04:55,207
You're a fool.

970
01:04:56,832 --> 01:05:01,248
- You too are a fool.
- Oh, god.

971
01:05:06,873 --> 01:05:09,457
Good morning, Sir.

972
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:21,207
Can't you greet?

973
01:05:22,415 --> 01:05:25,998
I don't like greeting.
I can't flatter him.

974
01:05:26,082 --> 01:05:28,248
It's not flattery, he's the boss.

975
01:05:28,332 --> 01:05:30,165
- So what if he's the boss?
- What?

976
01:05:30,248 --> 01:05:31,332
So what if he's the boss?

977
01:05:31,415 --> 01:05:34,082
You're not even scared about your job.

978
01:05:34,165 --> 01:05:36,623
A hardworking man
can get hundreds of jobs.

979
01:05:36,707 --> 01:05:39,290
I do not care. Go and do your work.

980
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:46,165
Brother, who is Chander?

981
01:05:46,248 --> 01:05:49,123
Mine. That's him. Chandu.

982
01:05:50,123 --> 01:05:51,748
Sir has called you.

983
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:53,707
Why? What happened to him?

984
01:05:53,790 --> 01:05:57,457
Nothing happened to him,
it'll happen to you. Go.

985
01:06:02,332 --> 01:06:04,707
- He has lost his job.
- Yes. - Yes.

986
01:06:07,290 --> 01:06:08,540
Come in.

987
01:06:10,957 --> 01:06:13,665
- Did you call me, sir?
- Yes. Close the door.

988
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:16,040
- Yes?
- Close the door.

989
01:06:19,332 --> 01:06:20,123
Tell me.

990
01:06:20,207 --> 01:06:22,332
You fool.
Why didn't you come yesterday?

991
01:06:22,957 --> 01:06:25,915
- Don't ask here..
- Don't change the topic. Answer me.

992
01:06:25,998 --> 01:06:27,498
Yesterday..

993
01:06:27,915 --> 01:06:30,415
Explain why? Yes.

994
01:06:30,498 --> 01:06:31,415
- Good morning, Sir.
- Good morning.

995
01:06:31,498 --> 01:06:34,207
- Mr. Dhupia isn't well today. He'll not come to the office.
- Okay.

996
01:06:34,957 --> 01:06:37,415
Answer me. You may go.

997
01:06:41,748 --> 01:06:43,207
Now, answer me.

998
01:06:43,290 --> 01:06:45,207
- There was a huge problem.
- What happened?

999
01:06:45,290 --> 01:06:46,748
Yesterday, my hands got stuck.

1000
01:06:46,832 --> 01:06:49,123
So, you call that,
hands getting stuck.

1001
01:06:49,207 --> 01:06:50,498
I was very ill.

1002
01:06:50,582 --> 01:06:52,641
You were ill or did you
have other things on your mind?

1003
01:06:52,665 --> 01:06:55,873
- For a girl, you forget your friend.
- Talk slowly. - Sorry.

1004
01:06:55,957 --> 01:06:58,457
- You think I do not know anything.
- What do you know?

1005
01:06:58,540 --> 01:07:01,457
I'll tell you.
Last night, I had come to your house.

1006
01:07:01,957 --> 01:07:04,123
You came to my house in the slum?

1007
01:07:04,207 --> 01:07:05,873
Yes, son.

1008
01:07:05,957 --> 01:07:09,748
And I saw that girl
who was feeding you.

1009
01:07:10,123 --> 01:07:12,003
Why did you come there?
If anyone had seen you..

1010
01:07:12,082 --> 01:07:14,290
- Don't change the topic..
- Don't shout, speak slowly.

1011
01:07:14,373 --> 01:07:15,498
Sorry.

1012
01:07:17,165 --> 01:07:19,373
- Who was that girl?
- My neighbour.

1013
01:07:19,998 --> 01:07:21,665
In your arms?

1014
01:07:21,748 --> 01:07:24,498
Not in my arms,
living in the house beside me.

1015
01:07:25,873 --> 01:07:27,457
- What is her name?
- Shama.

1016
01:07:28,665 --> 01:07:31,332
Shama. So soon you
got to know her name too?

1017
01:07:31,415 --> 01:07:34,040
- Obviously, the girl stay besides me..
- Don't shout.

1018
01:07:34,415 --> 01:07:35,957
- Sorry.
- Will you've a cigarette?

1019
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:38,290
- You've lost your mind.
- But, Somu..

1020
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:41,623
I'm not Somu, my name is Chander.

1021
01:07:41,707 --> 01:07:45,165
Mr. Chander.
I've to praise your taste.

1022
01:07:45,582 --> 01:07:48,832
Your Shama is very good.

1023
01:07:49,623 --> 01:07:50,873
- Did you do anything?
- What?

1024
01:07:50,957 --> 01:07:53,623
- Did you do anything with the girl?
- No, friend.

1025
01:07:53,707 --> 01:07:55,832
I ask why didn't you?

1026
01:07:55,915 --> 01:07:57,349
When will you do it? When you get old?

1027
01:07:57,373 --> 01:08:00,373
Did you see?
He's young, but does not do anything.

1028
01:08:00,457 --> 01:08:03,498
- What, sir?
- Work. He does not work.

1029
01:08:03,540 --> 01:08:06,623
Whenever you see him he's talking.
Now, go and do something.

1030
01:08:06,707 --> 01:08:07,748
What, boss?

1031
01:08:07,832 --> 01:08:09,540
Work. Just name..

1032
01:08:09,623 --> 01:08:12,707
Nothing happens by only talking.
Got it? Now go.

1033
01:08:12,790 --> 01:08:14,082
Yes, boss.

1034
01:08:14,373 --> 01:08:16,040
- And listen.
- Yes.

1035
01:08:16,540 --> 01:08:19,540
- Inform me of your progress.
- Yes.

1036
01:08:20,872 --> 01:08:22,372
Now, you can go.

1037
01:08:24,997 --> 01:08:26,247
Yes?

1038
01:08:26,332 --> 01:08:28,123
Why are you moving to and fro?

1039
01:08:28,207 --> 01:08:30,957
- To get these papers signed.
- Really? Give it to me.

1040
01:08:32,622 --> 01:08:34,122
- Did you read them?
- Yes.

1041
01:08:34,540 --> 01:08:36,457
- So I should sign them?
- Yes.

1042
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:41,082
Father ordered not to sign
anything without reading it.

1043
01:08:43,957 --> 01:08:45,040
Then?

1044
01:08:45,497 --> 01:08:48,331
Then sir spoke loudly.

1045
01:08:48,582 --> 01:08:50,290
I spoke louder than him.

1046
01:08:50,457 --> 01:08:54,248
I stood in front of him and said,
long live the revolution.

1047
01:08:54,332 --> 01:08:56,207
You said all that to sir?

1048
01:08:57,247 --> 01:08:59,914
- Yes.
- And you weren't scared?

1049
01:09:00,582 --> 01:09:01,873
(Laughing)

1050
01:09:02,540 --> 01:09:05,457
I get paid for working,
not for greeting.

1051
01:09:05,540 --> 01:09:06,790
What is happening, friend?

1052
01:09:06,872 --> 01:09:08,831
- Brother was amazing today.
- What did he do?

1053
01:09:08,915 --> 01:09:10,540
He said a lot to his boss.

1054
01:09:10,582 --> 01:09:12,998
- Won't he be fired?
- What did he say?

1055
01:09:13,497 --> 01:09:15,247
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

1056
01:09:15,790 --> 01:09:17,540
That conversation with sir.

1057
01:09:17,747 --> 01:09:20,872
Oh, that. Dhondu was amazing today.

1058
01:09:20,957 --> 01:09:23,748
I say Shama let's have tea on this.

1059
01:09:25,747 --> 01:09:26,747
Yes.

1060
01:09:28,332 --> 01:09:29,998
Take this.

1061
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:34,873
This is a dress. For whom?

1062
01:09:35,622 --> 01:09:37,456
- I don't wear it.
- So?

1063
01:09:37,747 --> 01:09:40,206
- See.
- He has got it for you.

1064
01:09:40,290 --> 01:09:44,248
Wear it. You'll look like a heroine.

1065
01:09:48,832 --> 01:09:52,457
Listen, Vicky.
The Mill's Founder's Day is coming up.

1066
01:09:52,540 --> 01:09:54,373
The workers think they'll get bonus.

1067
01:09:54,457 --> 01:09:56,832
Yes, even Father was
saying it has to be announced.

1068
01:09:57,790 --> 01:09:59,040
Do not announce it.

1069
01:10:01,415 --> 01:10:02,290
Why?

1070
01:10:02,373 --> 01:10:04,540
If bonus has to be given,
we'll not give it easily.

1071
01:10:04,582 --> 01:10:05,957
We'll create some more drama.

1072
01:10:06,165 --> 01:10:08,415
So that they feel
that if I wasn't there..

1073
01:10:08,498 --> 01:10:09,938
They wouldn't have got the bonus.

1074
01:10:09,998 --> 01:10:13,248
Very good, friend.
You are far-sighted.

1075
01:10:13,332 --> 01:10:15,165
Fantastic. Shake hands.

1076
01:10:18,832 --> 01:10:20,040
- Somu.
- Yes.

1077
01:10:21,540 --> 01:10:24,373
Your hands have become
so hard working on the machines.

1078
01:10:25,498 --> 01:10:26,665
I don't like it.

1079
01:10:27,373 --> 01:10:30,457
Vicky, I've left my mother,
sister, my house.

1080
01:10:30,540 --> 01:10:32,415
I'm living in slum. Why?

1081
01:10:33,540 --> 01:10:35,665
You're dearer to me than my life.

1082
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:38,873
Because I had seen tears in your eyes.

1083
01:10:39,290 --> 01:10:43,332
The one who makes you
cry won't live in peace.

1084
01:10:43,707 --> 01:10:46,582
These hands have
not only become hard..

1085
01:10:46,957 --> 01:10:48,457
But also strong.

1086
01:10:48,540 --> 01:10:51,665
Even if someone wants to
tear them apart, he couldn't.

1087
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:57,415
(Horn Honking)

1088
01:10:57,540 --> 01:10:59,748
- Who is this?
- This must be Nisha.

1089
01:11:00,332 --> 01:11:01,998
- Nisha?
- Yes.

1090
01:11:02,957 --> 01:11:06,457
- You are wooing a new girl?
- No, she's wooing me on Father's request.

1091
01:11:06,540 --> 01:11:07,998
All right, then I'll leave.

1092
01:11:08,082 --> 01:11:11,165
- You..
- I know, from the bathroom.

1093
01:11:12,415 --> 01:11:15,332
(Whistling)

1094
01:11:19,165 --> 01:11:20,332
Hi.

1095
01:11:20,998 --> 01:11:21,998
Hello.

1096
01:11:22,707 --> 01:11:25,373
- What were you doing?
- Nothing. Just having whisky.

1097
01:11:25,582 --> 01:11:26,582
Sit.

1098
01:11:29,915 --> 01:11:32,165
I was getting bored by myself.

1099
01:11:34,082 --> 01:11:35,498
- Alone?
- Yes.

1100
01:11:35,915 --> 01:11:37,998
But I can see two glasses.

1101
01:11:38,332 --> 01:11:40,873
Yes, both are my glasses.

1102
01:11:40,957 --> 01:11:44,165
This is mine and
this is for my friend.

1103
01:11:44,457 --> 01:11:45,457
Who?

1104
01:11:45,665 --> 01:11:47,748
There is one in Delhi.

1105
01:11:48,873 --> 01:11:50,415
- In Delhi?
- Yes.

1106
01:11:51,957 --> 01:11:54,207
- Sure?
- Yes, why?

1107
01:11:55,373 --> 01:11:56,415
Just like that.

1108
01:11:56,832 --> 01:12:00,165
I felt someone was here before I came.

1109
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:02,623
Or was she there?

1110
01:12:02,707 --> 01:12:04,082
(Laughing)

1111
01:12:05,540 --> 01:12:07,873
Nisha, you're very clever.

1112
01:12:08,082 --> 01:12:11,540
And it's very difficult
to be friends with clever girls.

1113
01:12:20,873 --> 01:12:21,873
You?

1114
01:12:22,207 --> 01:12:23,832
- Son Chander?
- Yes.

1115
01:12:23,915 --> 01:12:25,582
I'm Karim's mother.

1116
01:12:26,207 --> 01:12:29,540
You're my son from today.

1117
01:12:29,582 --> 01:12:30,974
These are Karim's wife and children.

1118
01:12:30,998 --> 01:12:36,248
Brother, I pray to God
to give you a long life.

1119
01:12:37,207 --> 01:12:40,123
Son, your poor mother
has made something for you.

1120
01:12:40,207 --> 01:12:41,998
Eat it at night.

1121
01:12:43,165 --> 01:12:45,123
God bless you.

1122
01:12:45,207 --> 01:12:47,748
You've saved us from begging.

1123
01:13:19,165 --> 01:13:20,082
What happened?

1124
01:13:20,165 --> 01:13:21,415
What happened?

1125
01:13:21,498 --> 01:13:23,665
We won't get the bonus we get on..

1126
01:13:23,748 --> 01:13:25,165
- Founder's Day.
- Why?

1127
01:13:25,248 --> 01:13:27,290
Boss says this year
the profit has been less.

1128
01:13:27,373 --> 01:13:28,623
The work wasn't less.

1129
01:13:28,707 --> 01:13:30,582
- The output was the same.
- Yes.

1130
01:13:30,665 --> 01:13:32,873
They say,
this year the tax has increased.

1131
01:13:32,957 --> 01:13:35,498
- So the profit has been less.
- My foot.

1132
01:13:35,915 --> 01:13:37,641
If the tax has increased,
the prices have increased too.

1133
01:13:37,665 --> 01:13:40,540
And the public pay their taxes,
not the bosses.

1134
01:13:40,623 --> 01:13:42,040
Then why won't we get a bonus?

1135
01:13:42,123 --> 01:13:44,332
You'll not get bonus like this.

1136
01:13:44,415 --> 01:13:47,582
If you want bonus, go on a strike.
Threaten to stop all work.

1137
01:13:47,665 --> 01:13:50,998
Chander, do not instigate
the workers for nothing.

1138
01:13:51,457 --> 01:13:54,165
Before going on a strike
you've to assess your strength too.

1139
01:13:54,248 --> 01:13:56,123
And you've to see the
state of the workers too.

1140
01:13:56,207 --> 01:13:58,915
And you know next month
the monsoons will start too.

1141
01:13:58,998 --> 01:14:02,790
The ones who are scared of
rain can't face the storms, Mr. Bipin.

1142
01:14:02,873 --> 01:14:04,832
You sleep under your blanket.

1143
01:14:04,915 --> 01:14:06,498
I'll get the workers a bonus.

1144
01:14:06,540 --> 01:14:08,707
You're interfering in
the Union's work, Chander.

1145
01:14:08,915 --> 01:14:11,998
I don't stop the Union from
doing any work. You too don't stop me.

1146
01:14:12,082 --> 01:14:14,082
Brothers, I'm going to meet the boss.

1147
01:14:14,165 --> 01:14:17,540
- You can come if you want.
- Yes, let's go. - Stop.

1148
01:14:17,582 --> 01:14:18,540
Chander.

1149
01:14:18,582 --> 01:14:19,582
Chander.

1150
01:14:20,915 --> 01:14:22,332
What is it? What is all this?

1151
01:14:22,415 --> 01:14:23,748
We've come for our rights.

1152
01:14:23,832 --> 01:14:25,207
Here.

1153
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:28,540
Talk to me.

1154
01:14:30,123 --> 01:14:31,832
Is this the way to
ask for your rights?

1155
01:14:31,915 --> 01:14:34,457
Rights aren't asked for, but snatched.

1156
01:14:34,790 --> 01:14:36,915
Every year workers
get bonus on this day.

1157
01:14:36,998 --> 01:14:39,040
We've come to take this year's bonus.

1158
01:14:39,707 --> 01:14:42,998
What if I don't give it to you?

1159
01:14:43,498 --> 01:14:46,082
- We know how to take it.
- What will you do?

1160
01:14:46,498 --> 01:14:48,748
We've built this Mill with our labour.

1161
01:14:48,832 --> 01:14:50,373
We can ruin the Mill too.

1162
01:14:52,957 --> 01:14:55,915
This Mill hasn't been
built with your labour. Got it?

1163
01:14:57,790 --> 01:14:59,665
It was built with our
intelligence and brains.

1164
01:14:59,998 --> 01:15:04,207
You can only make plans with
your intelligence, not buildings.

1165
01:15:04,498 --> 01:15:07,082
The machines we work on so hard..

1166
01:15:07,165 --> 01:15:08,915
Can be shut down too, sir.

1167
01:15:08,998 --> 01:15:11,832
I hired you and I can fire you.

1168
01:15:11,915 --> 01:15:14,248
You can fire us,
but you can't save the Mill.

1169
01:15:14,498 --> 01:15:17,957
Are you threatening? Get out. I say.

1170
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:19,373
Dhupia, call the police.

1171
01:15:19,665 --> 01:15:21,582
Forget police, call the army.

1172
01:15:22,457 --> 01:15:26,415
But if we don't get
bonus within 24 hours..

1173
01:15:27,332 --> 01:15:30,373
I'll tell you after 24 hours.
Come, brothers.

1174
01:15:30,457 --> 01:15:31,998
We'll take our bonus.

1175
01:15:32,082 --> 01:15:33,790
Or we'll demolish this Mill.

1176
01:15:33,873 --> 01:15:36,790
We'll go on strike to fight injustice.

1177
01:15:36,873 --> 01:15:38,582
Long live the revolution.

1178
01:15:38,623 --> 01:15:40,373
Long live the revolution.

1179
01:15:40,457 --> 01:15:42,248
Long live the revolution.

1180
01:15:46,290 --> 01:15:47,582
Mr. Dhupia.

1181
01:15:49,248 --> 01:15:51,040
- Mr. Dhupia.
- Yes.

1182
01:15:51,915 --> 01:15:52,915
Yes, Mr. Vikram.

1183
01:15:52,998 --> 01:15:54,540
- Did you inform the police?
- Yes.

1184
01:15:55,707 --> 01:15:59,082
- Stop the police and announce the bonus.
- Yes?

1185
01:15:59,915 --> 01:16:03,248
Stop the police and
announce the bonus.

1186
01:16:03,332 --> 01:16:05,748
(Crowd Chattering)

1187
01:16:22,207 --> 01:16:23,123
What is this, friend?

1188
01:16:23,207 --> 01:16:25,998
We've decided this time
in the Union elections..

1189
01:16:26,082 --> 01:16:27,558
We'll have you contest
instead of Bipin Lal.

1190
01:16:27,582 --> 01:16:29,422
Why are you tricking
me into becoming a leader?

1191
01:16:29,498 --> 01:16:30,832
I don't want to become a leader.

1192
01:16:30,915 --> 01:16:32,715
- I'm a worker, let me be a worker.
- Shut up.

1193
01:16:32,748 --> 01:16:35,207
Don't say anything.
This is our decision.

1194
01:16:35,290 --> 01:16:37,415
Brothers, in the coming election..

1195
01:16:37,498 --> 01:16:41,082
Chander will contest
against Bipin Lal on our side.

1196
01:16:41,165 --> 01:16:42,748
- Chander, brother.
- Long live.

1197
01:16:42,832 --> 01:16:44,457
- Chander, brother.
- Long live.

1198
01:16:48,373 --> 01:16:50,207
Ladies and gentlemen.

1199
01:16:50,457 --> 01:16:51,748
Brothers and sisters.

1200
01:16:52,207 --> 01:16:54,540
In Hindi, women and men.

1201
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:59,707
Brothers and sisters.
Listen to me carefully.

1202
01:17:00,290 --> 01:17:05,457
(Music Playing)

1203
01:17:10,457 --> 01:17:15,123
"He's a liar. Don't vote for him."

1204
01:17:15,707 --> 01:17:20,165
"He's a liar. Don't vote for him."

1205
01:17:20,873 --> 01:17:25,582
"Even if he gives you money,
don't vote for him."

1206
01:17:26,207 --> 01:17:29,498
"We work hard and
he reaps the benefits."

1207
01:17:29,540 --> 01:17:32,373
"We work hard and
he reaps the benefits."

1208
01:17:32,457 --> 01:17:36,457
"Do not even take his name."

1209
01:17:36,540 --> 01:17:41,332
"He's a liar. Don't vote for him."

1210
01:17:41,415 --> 01:17:46,582
- "Say it.
- He's a liar. Don't vote for him."

1211
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:15,498
"This leader of ours isn't a lion,
but a mouse."

1212
01:18:15,582 --> 01:18:18,998
"He takes bribe and
goes to cinema everyday."

1213
01:18:19,082 --> 01:18:23,998
"He goes to cinema everyday."

1214
01:18:26,123 --> 01:18:29,540
"This leader of ours isn't a lion,
but a mouse."

1215
01:18:29,582 --> 01:18:33,123
"He takes bribe and
goes to cinema everyday."

1216
01:18:33,207 --> 01:18:35,915
- "I see.
- Yes?"

1217
01:18:36,665 --> 01:18:40,165
"He's with the thieves,
he's not with us."

1218
01:18:40,248 --> 01:18:43,707
"Do not support him."

1219
01:18:43,790 --> 01:18:48,415
"He's a liar. Don't vote for him."

1220
01:18:49,123 --> 01:18:54,332
"He's a liar. Don't vote for him."

1221
01:18:54,707 --> 01:18:56,915
"My dear country-men."

1222
01:18:56,998 --> 01:19:00,248
"Listen to me, brother."

1223
01:19:03,915 --> 01:19:07,373
"He's not yours nor mine,
but the boss's stooge."

1224
01:19:07,457 --> 01:19:10,873
"He is his yes-man.
He's only for the money."

1225
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:15,748
"He's only for the money."

1226
01:19:18,082 --> 01:19:21,457
"He's not yours nor mine,
but the boss's stooge."

1227
01:19:21,540 --> 01:19:25,290
"He is his yes-man.
He's only for the money."

1228
01:19:25,373 --> 01:19:28,623
- "Oh, he's a big thief.
- Yes."

1229
01:19:28,707 --> 01:19:32,123
"When he gets the chance,
he'll let you down."

1230
01:19:32,207 --> 01:19:35,790
"Then do not tell us."

1231
01:19:35,873 --> 01:19:40,540
"He's a liar. Don't vote for him."

1232
01:19:40,582 --> 01:19:46,040
"Even if he gives you money,
don't vote for him."

1233
01:19:46,332 --> 01:19:49,790
"We work hard and
he reaps the benefits."

1234
01:19:49,873 --> 01:19:53,540
"Do not even take his name."

1235
01:19:53,582 --> 01:19:57,498
- "He's a liar, Don't vote for him."
- "Absolute liar."

1236
01:19:57,582 --> 01:19:58,665
"Don't give him."

1237
01:19:58,748 --> 01:20:02,498
- "He's a liar, Don't vote for him."
- "He's a liar."

1238
01:20:02,540 --> 01:20:05,207
"Don't vote for him."

1239
01:20:24,915 --> 01:20:28,123
Chander Singh. Chander Singh.

1240
01:20:28,832 --> 01:20:30,165
Chander Singh.

1241
01:20:30,332 --> 01:20:34,332
Mr. Bipin, Chander Singh.

1242
01:20:34,665 --> 01:20:35,957
That's it.

1243
01:20:39,082 --> 01:20:40,915
Brother Chander won.

1244
01:20:40,998 --> 01:20:43,290
(All Cheering)

1245
01:20:43,582 --> 01:20:44,707
Dad.

1246
01:20:47,873 --> 01:20:48,873
Out.

1247
01:20:52,415 --> 01:20:53,498
What happened?

1248
01:20:53,957 --> 01:20:55,290
I want to give you good news Dad.

1249
01:20:55,373 --> 01:20:57,998
- So why not in front of him?
- No. I don't like this man.

1250
01:20:58,582 --> 01:21:02,040
Dad, I've avenged my insults.

1251
01:21:02,373 --> 01:21:05,498
Bipin Lal Pandey is out of the Union.

1252
01:21:06,957 --> 01:21:11,373
I know. In place of
him your friend has come.

1253
01:21:11,457 --> 01:21:12,457
What?

1254
01:21:13,832 --> 01:21:17,498
You knew this?

1255
01:21:21,082 --> 01:21:24,457
I'm not looking after such
a big business just like that.

1256
01:21:26,540 --> 01:21:27,790
But Vicky..

1257
01:21:30,832 --> 01:21:34,040
- There is nothing to be very happy about.
- Why?

1258
01:21:34,998 --> 01:21:39,998
Because your friend comes
from a particular section of society.

1259
01:21:41,790 --> 01:21:44,332
He's neither a beggar nor rich.

1260
01:21:44,707 --> 01:21:46,165
He's from the middle class.

1261
01:21:46,707 --> 01:21:48,248
That is very dangerous.

1262
01:21:50,123 --> 01:21:52,915
- You can't trust them.
- No, what are you saying?

1263
01:21:54,373 --> 01:21:57,207
Most of the traitors
and the loyal ones are..

1264
01:21:57,582 --> 01:21:59,165
From the middle class.

1265
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:03,248
On one side they've
ambition to make it big.

1266
01:22:04,957 --> 01:22:07,332
So, it's easy to make them traitors.

1267
01:22:09,498 --> 01:22:10,748
And on the other side..

1268
01:22:12,290 --> 01:22:16,248
One thing always
sticks to them like glue.

1269
01:22:17,457 --> 01:22:19,748
And that is their conscience.

1270
01:22:20,915 --> 01:22:25,623
Vicky, due to this they
can become an enemy at any time.

1271
01:22:26,707 --> 01:22:27,998
This is the last case.

1272
01:22:29,457 --> 01:22:33,457
Maheshwar has to go. His father died.

1273
01:22:33,957 --> 01:22:37,040
- How?
- He was standing all day for rations.

1274
01:22:37,248 --> 01:22:40,123
He suffered a heart attack and died.

1275
01:22:43,165 --> 01:22:44,832
All right. Send him today.

1276
01:22:46,665 --> 01:22:49,707
You wanted to see the place. Let's go.

1277
01:22:55,707 --> 01:22:57,790
Come, brother Karim. What is the news?

1278
01:22:57,873 --> 01:22:59,790
I want to invite you
to my daughter's wedding.

1279
01:22:59,873 --> 01:23:03,373
Congratulations, Uncle.
Will you give us sweets?

1280
01:23:03,457 --> 01:23:05,498
It's your sister's wedding.

1281
01:23:05,623 --> 01:23:08,540
Everything's happening
by God's grace and your favour.

1282
01:23:08,623 --> 01:23:11,123
You've saved my family.

1283
01:23:11,498 --> 01:23:13,123
God cut off my hand..

1284
01:23:13,207 --> 01:23:15,498
And so I got 5000 as compensation.

1285
01:23:15,540 --> 01:23:18,207
Or my daughter would've
remained unmarried.

1286
01:23:22,415 --> 01:23:26,457
"It gets cut very easily, friend."

1287
01:23:26,915 --> 01:23:30,582
"Try cutting your
neck with this string."

1288
01:23:30,915 --> 01:23:33,873
Friend. At such an old age
you're flying a kite like a child.

1289
01:23:33,957 --> 01:23:36,332
It's a passion as
well as part of my work.

1290
01:23:36,415 --> 01:23:38,998
Because I get food from what I earn.

1291
01:23:39,082 --> 01:23:41,248
Not food, but drink.

1292
01:23:41,915 --> 01:23:43,665
- Sir, you may go. I'm coming.
- Okay.

1293
01:23:43,748 --> 01:23:44,832
And passion?

1294
01:23:44,998 --> 01:23:48,582
It's my passion because
when the kite goes very high..

1295
01:23:48,790 --> 01:23:53,665
I feel happy to surpass
those high up in the sky.

1296
01:23:54,457 --> 01:23:55,498
Not God.

1297
01:23:55,540 --> 01:23:57,707
I understand, friend.

1298
01:23:57,790 --> 01:24:01,665
You mean people
leaving in skyscrapers?

1299
01:24:02,873 --> 01:24:04,540
Get some tea and biscuits.

1300
01:24:05,165 --> 01:24:08,540
Brother Alam,
I need some thread by evening.

1301
01:24:08,582 --> 01:24:11,582
You'll get it. A very strong one.

1302
01:24:11,915 --> 01:24:14,790
- How are you, brother Alam?
- Come, sister Anandi.

1303
01:24:14,873 --> 01:24:17,873
- I'm fine, how are you?
- Fine.

1304
01:24:17,957 --> 01:24:20,582
- And how is Shankar?
- He's the same.

1305
01:24:20,665 --> 01:24:22,373
Is the treatment going on?

1306
01:24:22,457 --> 01:24:23,748
The treatment's going on.

1307
01:24:28,248 --> 01:24:32,290
Very good, friend. What are you doing?

1308
01:24:32,373 --> 01:24:34,332
You've just ordered for tea.

1309
01:24:36,540 --> 01:24:39,332
Anandi works as a prostitute.
We all know that.

1310
01:24:39,957 --> 01:24:41,165
But what else will she do?

1311
01:24:42,123 --> 01:24:44,873
Her husband's in bed since six months.

1312
01:24:45,290 --> 01:24:46,748
She has two small children.

1313
01:24:47,290 --> 01:24:48,707
How will she feed them?

1314
01:24:48,957 --> 01:24:50,498
How will she treat her husband?

1315
01:24:50,790 --> 01:24:51,998
Should she steal?

1316
01:24:52,623 --> 01:24:55,165
If she begs,
would she get more respect?

1317
01:24:55,540 --> 01:25:02,082
Some sell talent, some loyalty,
and some sell their conscience.

1318
01:25:02,873 --> 01:25:07,248
I want to give you my belongings.

1319
01:25:10,332 --> 01:25:13,040
You're taking care
of these poor people.

1320
01:25:14,207 --> 01:25:16,957
These are my poetries, my songs.

1321
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:20,207
I don't have any right
to keep them here anymore.

1322
01:25:21,123 --> 01:25:22,623
The one who had written these..

1323
01:25:22,998 --> 01:25:24,623
Was someone else, not me.

1324
01:25:25,498 --> 01:25:29,082
I have lost life's battle
and drowned in liquor.

1325
01:25:30,665 --> 01:25:32,123
Take care of it.

1326
01:25:42,082 --> 01:25:44,122
It has been two months
since the elections got over.

1327
01:25:44,332 --> 01:25:47,082
And you're still in the slum.

1328
01:25:47,415 --> 01:25:50,290
You said you'd keep
someone else and resign.

1329
01:25:50,373 --> 01:25:51,373
What happened?

1330
01:25:51,915 --> 01:25:53,498
I should find someone else.

1331
01:25:53,915 --> 01:25:56,498
What about your friend,
who wakes you up every morning.

1332
01:25:56,582 --> 01:25:57,832
- Dhondu?
- Yes.

1333
01:25:57,915 --> 01:26:00,707
He's a fool.
He can't even give a thumb impression.

1334
01:26:00,790 --> 01:26:02,957
Brother, we need such men.

1335
01:26:04,248 --> 01:26:07,165
It's difficult to detach
an uneducated man from his society.

1336
01:26:07,707 --> 01:26:10,790
- Only they join who want to fly.
- Then what should we do?

1337
01:26:11,248 --> 01:26:15,290
Vicky, I'm thinking about one man.

1338
01:26:15,915 --> 01:26:16,957
Who?

1339
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:19,373
Bipin Lal.

1340
01:26:21,290 --> 01:26:22,457
What?

1341
01:26:23,165 --> 01:26:25,290
Here. First have a peg.

1342
01:26:25,832 --> 01:26:27,540
You're looking upset.

1343
01:26:27,748 --> 01:26:31,415
Vicky, how much is this
Chivas Regal bottle for?

1344
01:26:32,040 --> 01:26:35,207
Around Rs.200-250. Why?

1345
01:26:35,582 --> 01:26:38,998
- And it makes 10-12 pegs.
- Yes.

1346
01:26:39,790 --> 01:26:43,332
- And one peg must be for Rs.20-25?
- Right.

1347
01:26:43,623 --> 01:26:46,165
It means this one glass
is equal to a worker's..

1348
01:26:46,248 --> 01:26:48,832
Monthly ration for his family.

1349
01:26:49,457 --> 01:26:50,540
Have you thought..

1350
01:26:51,415 --> 01:26:54,040
By drinking this
we starve one family?

1351
01:26:55,623 --> 01:26:57,915
What has happened to you?

1352
01:26:58,207 --> 01:27:00,248
You're talking like
the leader of the workers.

1353
01:27:01,540 --> 01:27:04,998
I don't know, Vicky.
Maybe I got their sadness.

1354
01:27:05,832 --> 01:27:09,165
Drink up. All your sadness
will go away. Cheers. Bottoms up.

1355
01:27:58,832 --> 01:28:00,040
(Knock On Door)

1356
01:28:07,248 --> 01:28:09,998
- Is Mr. Bipin Lal there?
- Yes, your name.

1357
01:28:10,082 --> 01:28:13,998
- Chander.
- Chander! Come inside.

1358
01:28:14,540 --> 01:28:15,748
Come.

1359
01:28:17,832 --> 01:28:20,498
She's my daughter Rama. And..

1360
01:28:20,540 --> 01:28:22,540
Our Union's new leader.

1361
01:28:23,207 --> 01:28:25,998
Seeing your face, I feel
you haven't eaten since morning.

1362
01:28:26,082 --> 01:28:28,165
Wait, I'll serve you
food along with father.

1363
01:28:28,248 --> 01:28:30,957
- I'm not hungry.
- You'll eat before leaving.

1364
01:28:32,498 --> 01:28:35,248
She's very stubborn,
you'll have to eat.

1365
01:28:37,082 --> 01:28:40,707
What is it?
You're looking very worried.

1366
01:28:43,540 --> 01:28:47,998
Mr. Bipin Lal, take the
responsibility of the Union back.

1367
01:28:48,790 --> 01:28:50,123
What do you mean?

1368
01:28:51,123 --> 01:28:52,707
I can't see anymore.

1369
01:28:53,832 --> 01:28:57,540
I'm afraid seeing this poverty.

1370
01:28:57,582 --> 01:28:59,332
Are you seeing it for the first time?

1371
01:29:01,998 --> 01:29:04,540
Mr. Bipin Lal,
you come back to your post.

1372
01:29:04,790 --> 01:29:05,832
I'm going back.

1373
01:29:06,040 --> 01:29:09,373
Chander, you can't go back now.

1374
01:29:09,957 --> 01:29:12,415
Why not? What do you know about me?

1375
01:29:12,998 --> 01:29:16,498
Son, I only know..

1376
01:29:17,665 --> 01:29:20,623
The one who can't
see grief and pain..

1377
01:29:21,998 --> 01:29:25,123
Can treat that grief and pain.

1378
01:29:26,373 --> 01:29:30,498
His conscience won't
let him turn his back..

1379
01:29:30,665 --> 01:29:31,998
On this grief and pain.

1380
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:39,207
Mr. Bipin Lal,
can you tell me why poverty exists?

1381
01:29:39,582 --> 01:29:41,457
Why are people in so much pain?

1382
01:29:41,790 --> 01:29:43,707
There are many reasons.

1383
01:29:44,457 --> 01:29:46,332
But the biggest reason is..

1384
01:29:46,957 --> 01:29:51,290
Some people want to
buy everything of this country.

1385
01:29:51,623 --> 01:29:54,415
This land, this earth, everything.

1386
01:29:56,873 --> 01:29:58,707
All this can be ended?

1387
01:30:01,790 --> 01:30:04,040
This is our struggle, Chander.

1388
01:30:05,415 --> 01:30:08,790
When the people in
politics start thinking..

1389
01:30:09,540 --> 01:30:11,457
Of the good of the
public instead of power..

1390
01:30:11,540 --> 01:30:13,873
Or when the public know who their..

1391
01:30:13,957 --> 01:30:17,040
Real leaders are and
drive out these fake leaders..

1392
01:30:17,832 --> 01:30:19,623
This dream will come true.

1393
01:30:21,123 --> 01:30:26,290
I don't know when and
how this revolution will come.

1394
01:30:27,248 --> 01:30:29,957
People here are peace-loving.

1395
01:30:30,332 --> 01:30:31,832
If they don't get to eat..

1396
01:30:32,457 --> 01:30:37,290
They quietly sit in front of
the food shop and bear their hunger.

1397
01:30:37,998 --> 01:30:39,498
Father, food is served.

1398
01:30:39,582 --> 01:30:41,123
Rama, come here.

1399
01:30:41,707 --> 01:30:45,165
Chander, if you want
you can learn a lot from Rama.

1400
01:30:45,415 --> 01:30:47,373
- About this.
- What?

1401
01:30:47,915 --> 01:30:50,207
Her husband was a big leader.

1402
01:30:50,665 --> 01:30:52,790
He was killed during a strike.

1403
01:30:53,790 --> 01:30:56,748
It was only the first
year of their marriage.

1404
01:30:56,832 --> 01:30:59,665
After that I took the
responsibility of my Union.

1405
01:30:59,998 --> 01:31:02,623
I thought if we've to
die we must fight and die.

1406
01:31:02,707 --> 01:31:04,582
Why should we die without a fight?

1407
01:31:05,623 --> 01:31:08,373
And in this work
Rama became my teacher.

1408
01:31:08,707 --> 01:31:10,248
What are you saying?

1409
01:31:11,373 --> 01:31:12,957
I'm very worried, sister.

1410
01:31:14,165 --> 01:31:15,873
I can't see anyway.

1411
01:31:17,415 --> 01:31:21,290
Brother Chander,
do you love your people?

1412
01:31:22,165 --> 01:31:24,498
Then you understand
their pain and sorrow?

1413
01:31:24,707 --> 01:31:26,623
That is enough.

1414
01:31:27,373 --> 01:31:29,582
That love will guide you.

1415
01:31:44,832 --> 01:31:46,998
- Chander.
- Dhondu, you?

1416
01:31:47,082 --> 01:31:49,998
- Yes, come fast. Alam's in a very bad state.
- What happened?

1417
01:31:50,082 --> 01:31:51,498
He vomited blood.

1418
01:31:51,582 --> 01:31:52,582
He can't be saved.

1419
01:31:52,665 --> 01:31:54,305
He's not even ready
to go to the hospital.

1420
01:31:54,332 --> 01:31:56,623
He's calling you. Hurry.

1421
01:31:58,790 --> 01:32:01,290
Aunt, friend has not come yet?

1422
01:32:01,373 --> 01:32:03,790
He'll come soon.
Brother has gone to call him.

1423
01:32:03,957 --> 01:32:06,665
When will he come? After my death?

1424
01:32:06,748 --> 01:32:08,540
No, brother. Don't say that.
(Crying)

1425
01:32:09,332 --> 01:32:11,748
Don't say that. You'll recover.

1426
01:32:14,707 --> 01:32:17,873
Friend, what happened friend?

1427
01:32:18,165 --> 01:32:19,957
Now, I've no sorrow.

1428
01:32:20,873 --> 01:32:24,832
Without you this party was incomplete.

1429
01:32:25,665 --> 01:32:30,165
And how would a poet
leave this party incomplete.

1430
01:32:30,373 --> 01:32:31,748
Who will let you go?

1431
01:32:32,082 --> 01:32:33,832
To the hospital?
Dhondu, call an ambulance.

1432
01:32:33,915 --> 01:32:36,582
No. Don't call for an ambulance.

1433
01:32:37,040 --> 01:32:41,373
- Now, I'll go on your shoulder.
- Quiet.

1434
01:32:41,665 --> 01:32:42,915
For our friendship's sake.

1435
01:32:43,207 --> 01:32:45,123
Today, you'll do as I tell you to do.

1436
01:32:46,040 --> 01:32:48,832
At least on the last
day let me do as I want.

1437
01:32:50,540 --> 01:32:55,498
Friend, after I die distribute
these kites to these children.

1438
01:32:55,582 --> 01:32:58,082
- Alam.
- One more thing.

1439
01:32:58,790 --> 01:33:01,998
Sing that song,
which you had composed.

1440
01:33:02,082 --> 01:33:04,415
I'll surely sing it
to you when you recover.

1441
01:33:04,498 --> 01:33:08,207
Friend, for friendship's sake.

1442
01:33:28,290 --> 01:33:34,290
"I'm a defamed poet."

1443
01:33:40,832 --> 01:33:46,957
"I'm a defamed poet."

1444
01:33:47,748 --> 01:33:52,873
"I'm leaving."

1445
01:33:53,540 --> 01:33:57,582
"I'm leaving."

1446
01:33:57,998 --> 01:34:04,207
"Defeated by the crowds."

1447
01:34:04,873 --> 01:34:10,332
"I'm leaving."

1448
01:34:10,623 --> 01:34:14,582
"I'm leaving."

1449
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:20,498
"I'm a defamed poet."

1450
01:34:46,582 --> 01:34:54,582
"You'll get some goods from my house."

1451
01:34:56,415 --> 01:35:04,415
"You'll find a book
of the crazy poet."

1452
01:35:06,373 --> 01:35:10,790
"You'll find one other thing."

1453
01:35:10,873 --> 01:35:16,707
"A broken empty glass."

1454
01:35:17,790 --> 01:35:22,873
"I'm leaving."

1455
01:35:23,457 --> 01:35:27,373
"I'm leaving."

1456
01:35:27,790 --> 01:35:32,707
"I'm a defamed poet."

1457
01:35:56,207 --> 01:36:04,207
"I had to endure suffering.
I had to bear pain."

1458
01:36:05,915 --> 01:36:13,915
"I had to cry more on my destiny."

1459
01:36:15,832 --> 01:36:23,832
"I've left behind
many things incomplete."

1460
01:36:27,165 --> 01:36:32,665
"I'm leaving."

1461
01:36:32,748 --> 01:36:37,082
"I'm leaving."

1462
01:36:37,165 --> 01:36:42,457
"I'm a defamed poet."

1463
01:36:51,540 --> 01:36:59,540
"My life is blocking
me from this journey."

1464
01:37:01,290 --> 01:37:09,290
"I don't know what hopes
are left in this broken heart."

1465
01:37:11,207 --> 01:37:15,582
"Let me go, my heart."

1466
01:37:15,665 --> 01:37:21,707
"My greetings to everyone."

1467
01:37:22,373 --> 01:37:27,582
"I'm leaving."

1468
01:37:28,165 --> 01:37:32,498
"I'm leaving."

1469
01:37:32,540 --> 01:37:38,582
"I'm a defamed poet."

1470
01:37:42,207 --> 01:37:43,332
Friend.

1471
01:37:45,332 --> 01:37:46,332
Friend.

1472
01:37:47,165 --> 01:37:48,207
Friend.

1473
01:37:48,665 --> 01:37:49,873
The ambulance has come.

1474
01:37:55,915 --> 01:37:57,040
Friend.

1475
01:38:07,582 --> 01:38:10,248
(All Cheering)

1476
01:38:13,040 --> 01:38:14,290
No, Vicky.

1477
01:38:15,832 --> 01:38:19,582
I can't bear it anymore.

1478
01:38:19,915 --> 01:38:21,498
I can't see anymore.

1479
01:38:21,540 --> 01:38:22,957
So who is telling you to see?

1480
01:38:23,040 --> 01:38:24,915
Your work is done, now leave it.

1481
01:38:24,998 --> 01:38:26,498
How should I leave it?

1482
01:38:26,790 --> 01:38:29,957
Their hunger and
thirst have trapped me.

1483
01:38:30,373 --> 01:38:32,290
I can't get out.

1484
01:38:32,498 --> 01:38:34,707
I don't know what you're saying.

1485
01:38:35,165 --> 01:38:37,957
Nowadays,
I can't understand your language.

1486
01:38:39,248 --> 01:38:41,415
If you could understand my state..

1487
01:38:41,832 --> 01:38:43,790
You'd understand what I'm saying.

1488
01:38:44,707 --> 01:38:46,665
Vicky, do one work for me.

1489
01:38:46,748 --> 01:38:49,248
- I'll be able to go with a clean conscience.
- What?

1490
01:38:49,332 --> 01:38:51,915
Increase their salary.
Agree to their demand of inflation.

1491
01:38:51,998 --> 01:38:54,623
Inflation?
They get money as per inflation.

1492
01:38:54,707 --> 01:38:56,665
Just for the namesake.

1493
01:38:56,748 --> 01:38:58,123
This is all a show.

1494
01:38:58,207 --> 01:38:59,891
They get some money
on the basis of inflation.

1495
01:38:59,915 --> 01:39:02,082
The next day the market
rates goes up ten times.

1496
01:39:02,582 --> 01:39:04,957
They get only dry bread to eat.

1497
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:08,040
When it dries up,
they dip it in tea and eat it.

1498
01:39:08,582 --> 01:39:12,207
For months,
they don't eat pulses or vegetables.

1499
01:39:12,457 --> 01:39:13,766
Potatoes which were
Rs.0.50 a kilogram are..

1500
01:39:13,790 --> 01:39:15,415
Now for Rs.1.50. Cauliflower was..

1501
01:39:15,498 --> 01:39:19,582
Don't talk about
the rates of vegetables.

1502
01:39:19,665 --> 01:39:21,373
What is there to worry about?

1503
01:39:21,457 --> 01:39:22,599
Tomorrow I'll approve their allowance.

1504
01:39:22,623 --> 01:39:24,373
What allowance?

1505
01:39:24,457 --> 01:39:26,082
Are the rates high due to me?

1506
01:39:26,165 --> 01:39:27,707
I've increased the prices of grains.

1507
01:39:27,790 --> 01:39:29,957
It's the Government's
duty to control the prices.

1508
01:39:30,040 --> 01:39:32,207
Ask allowance from the Government.

1509
01:39:32,582 --> 01:39:34,582
But dad aren't these your own workers?

1510
01:39:34,665 --> 01:39:36,040
If they eat only bread with tea..

1511
01:39:36,123 --> 01:39:37,540
How will they work?

1512
01:39:39,623 --> 01:39:42,415
When did you see their bread and tea?

1513
01:39:45,165 --> 01:39:49,832
Who told you the rates
of grains and pulses?

1514
01:39:50,665 --> 01:39:53,040
- Dad..
- All right.

1515
01:39:55,123 --> 01:39:59,498
When you're worried,
I'll have to think of something.

1516
01:40:01,207 --> 01:40:02,832
Leave all this to me.

1517
01:40:03,207 --> 01:40:04,748
What time is your flight?

1518
01:40:04,832 --> 01:40:07,082
11 o'clock. I'm just leaving.

1519
01:40:07,165 --> 01:40:10,082
- On the way I've to pick up Mr. Dhupia.
- Very good.

1520
01:40:10,998 --> 01:40:13,582
Get the deal finalised soon.

1521
01:40:14,082 --> 01:40:15,665
It's an ideal place.

1522
01:40:15,915 --> 01:40:18,707
I've heard about the border fights.

1523
01:40:18,790 --> 01:40:20,165
That's the reason.

1524
01:40:21,248 --> 01:40:25,540
Son, it's about far-sightedness.

1525
01:40:26,707 --> 01:40:28,665
Divide and rule.

1526
01:40:29,290 --> 01:40:34,207
It's a very old lesson that
the English gave us before leaving.

1527
01:40:36,123 --> 01:40:37,957
To make the workers work,
it's important..

1528
01:40:38,040 --> 01:40:39,332
To divide them.

1529
01:40:40,165 --> 01:40:43,873
Never let them think that
they're Indians of one sect.

1530
01:40:44,832 --> 01:40:48,748
Rather say,
you're a Madrasi, you're a Bengali..

1531
01:40:48,832 --> 01:40:50,582
You're a Punjabi, you're a Bihari.

1532
01:40:50,623 --> 01:40:52,873
What are you saying?
This is treachery.

1533
01:40:52,957 --> 01:40:54,915
It's absolutely anti-national.

1534
01:40:56,290 --> 01:40:59,665
Son, it's only about
getting your work done.

1535
01:41:00,248 --> 01:41:03,957
Since ages, we've been creating
fights between Hindus and Muslims..

1536
01:41:04,207 --> 01:41:05,998
And breaking the
unity of the workers.

1537
01:41:06,498 --> 01:41:08,332
And we've been taking out our work.

1538
01:41:08,832 --> 01:41:13,540
But what can we do.
People have understood that ploy.

1539
01:41:14,332 --> 01:41:15,748
Now there is a new game.

1540
01:41:16,207 --> 01:41:17,540
Fights at the border.

1541
01:41:17,748 --> 01:41:19,040
Tell the people..

1542
01:41:19,123 --> 01:41:21,748
That the others are
encroaching on your land.

1543
01:41:22,498 --> 01:41:24,516
That is enough. They'll
keep fighting between themselves.

1544
01:41:24,540 --> 01:41:25,582
They'll kill themselves.

1545
01:41:25,915 --> 01:41:30,332
They think if they get that land,
they'll be rich.

1546
01:41:32,415 --> 01:41:34,123
We'll rule.

1547
01:41:34,582 --> 01:41:37,915
They'll get the same bread
and onions that they've been getting.

1548
01:41:41,707 --> 01:41:43,582
Go and make the factory.

1549
01:41:43,665 --> 01:41:46,748
Later, call Somu and
you both take care of it.

1550
01:41:46,832 --> 01:41:48,207
You'll learn it too.

1551
01:41:51,623 --> 01:41:52,790
All right, Dad.

1552
01:42:11,498 --> 01:42:13,207
- Jay Singh.
- Yes.

1553
01:42:13,707 --> 01:42:15,998
- Did you keep an eye on Vicky?
- Yes.

1554
01:42:17,373 --> 01:42:19,498
How did he come to know
the prices of groceries?

1555
01:42:19,540 --> 01:42:22,207
Chander, that new Union leader..

1556
01:42:22,290 --> 01:42:24,040
He keeps instigating junior boss.

1557
01:42:24,123 --> 01:42:28,582
He keeps whispering to him.

1558
01:42:28,665 --> 01:42:30,332
He incites him.

1559
01:42:46,457 --> 01:42:49,373
Chander, the boss has come today.

1560
01:42:51,457 --> 01:42:53,248
With his stooge.

1561
01:43:12,915 --> 01:43:13,915
Somu.

1562
01:43:16,582 --> 01:43:17,957
What are you doing here?

1563
01:43:19,082 --> 01:43:23,540
- I..
- Have you fought and fled from home?

1564
01:43:24,998 --> 01:43:28,040
Silly, you're the owner of this place.

1565
01:43:29,040 --> 01:43:31,165
Is there any difference
between you and Vikram?

1566
01:43:32,498 --> 01:43:36,790
Are you both playing some pranks?

1567
01:43:38,165 --> 01:43:39,915
I can't trust you two.

1568
01:43:39,998 --> 01:43:41,790
Come with me.

1569
01:43:56,790 --> 01:43:58,915
Foolish traitor.

1570
01:43:58,998 --> 01:44:01,665
At least tell me what happened.

1571
01:44:02,040 --> 01:44:05,707
We can't trust a person.

1572
01:44:05,790 --> 01:44:07,998
But who? Tell me.

1573
01:44:08,082 --> 01:44:09,248
What should I say?

1574
01:44:10,582 --> 01:44:14,207
When a man like Chander
betrays workers then..

1575
01:44:14,290 --> 01:44:16,582
No. This can never happen.

1576
01:44:16,665 --> 01:44:17,957
This has happened.

1577
01:44:18,415 --> 01:44:20,248
Chander turned out
to be the boss' man.

1578
01:44:23,373 --> 01:44:25,457
(Crow Sound)

1579
01:44:50,207 --> 01:44:51,790
- Hit him!
- Hit him!

1580
01:44:53,290 --> 01:44:55,873
- No!
- Hit him!

1581
01:45:10,207 --> 01:45:12,040
What are you doing? Move away.

1582
01:45:12,123 --> 01:45:15,248
Leave him. Move away.

1583
01:45:15,498 --> 01:45:16,498
Move away.

1584
01:45:16,707 --> 01:45:18,290
What have you done?

1585
01:45:21,207 --> 01:45:24,415
- Have you gone crazy?
- Let him die. He's a traitor.

1586
01:45:24,498 --> 01:45:26,540
This is a lie.

1587
01:45:26,582 --> 01:45:30,123
Is he not friend of this person's son?
He came here to separate us.

1588
01:45:30,207 --> 01:45:31,790
This is right that he came.

1589
01:45:31,998 --> 01:45:34,165
But he is not like earlier.

1590
01:45:34,248 --> 01:45:39,207
Just think about this.

1591
01:45:39,582 --> 01:45:41,998
This is conspiracy.
They always play like this.

1592
01:45:42,623 --> 01:45:46,165
He is now became labor's friend.

1593
01:45:47,457 --> 01:45:48,582
Why?

1594
01:45:50,498 --> 01:45:58,498
Mr. Bipin Lal, this is true, I had
come to break the unity of the workers.

1595
01:45:59,248 --> 01:46:03,082
But thinking about their future...

1596
01:46:03,165 --> 01:46:05,248
I know that.

1597
01:46:06,207 --> 01:46:10,165
Someone can learn to say
Ram instead of kill.

1598
01:46:11,040 --> 01:46:13,873
Come let's take him in. Come.

1599
01:46:17,748 --> 01:46:19,040
Sridhar!

1600
01:46:19,832 --> 01:46:21,165
Sridhar!

1601
01:46:22,748 --> 01:46:24,790
Sir, had you gone out?

1602
01:46:24,873 --> 01:46:27,290
Yes. But I missed my flight.
I'll go by the evening flight.

1603
01:46:27,373 --> 01:46:28,915
Get the suitcase from the car.

1604
01:46:31,582 --> 01:46:32,707
Sir.

1605
01:46:33,457 --> 01:46:34,665
Sir.

1606
01:46:35,915 --> 01:46:38,415
- Why have you come here?
- It's very important news.

1607
01:46:38,498 --> 01:46:40,498
- I don't want to hear anything.
- It's about Somu.

1608
01:46:40,540 --> 01:46:42,998
Leave right now. Broker!

1609
01:46:44,207 --> 01:46:45,457
All right.

1610
01:46:47,498 --> 01:46:48,998
Wait.

1611
01:46:51,082 --> 01:46:53,832
- About whom did you come to tell me?
- About Somu.

1612
01:46:54,873 --> 01:46:58,623
- Who told you the name, Somu?
- I came to tell you this.

1613
01:46:58,707 --> 01:47:01,207
What? Tell me.

1614
01:47:01,665 --> 01:47:04,873
Sir, a broker takes his fees.

1615
01:47:06,748 --> 01:47:09,623
- Who told you this?
- Your father.

1616
01:47:09,915 --> 01:47:12,540
He exposed Somu in front
of everyone at the Mill.

1617
01:47:12,623 --> 01:47:15,623
And when he went to the colony,
they beat him severely.

1618
01:47:15,707 --> 01:47:18,165
- What are you saying?
- I swear. I'm telling the truth.

1619
01:47:18,248 --> 01:47:19,540
I've seen this with my own eyes.

1620
01:47:45,040 --> 01:47:46,082
Vicky.

1621
01:47:47,915 --> 01:47:48,915
Vicky.

1622
01:47:49,748 --> 01:47:52,123
Who dared to hit Somu? Tell me.

1623
01:47:53,582 --> 01:47:57,248
Who wants to fight? Come in front.

1624
01:47:58,540 --> 01:48:01,707
Rascal, put your hands up.

1625
01:48:02,582 --> 01:48:03,748
Come.

1626
01:48:04,082 --> 01:48:06,832
I will teach you all a lesson.

1627
01:48:08,998 --> 01:48:11,498
I will vanish everything.

1628
01:48:16,665 --> 01:48:18,373
Somu, come with me.

1629
01:48:18,623 --> 01:48:20,457
I won't let you stay here anymore.

1630
01:48:20,540 --> 01:48:22,832
Vicky, sit here quietly.

1631
01:48:22,915 --> 01:48:25,415
I've not come to sit,
but to take you. Come on.

1632
01:48:27,998 --> 01:48:29,998
It's very difficult for me to leave.

1633
01:48:30,540 --> 01:48:31,707
Meaning?

1634
01:48:32,707 --> 01:48:34,457
You won't understand.

1635
01:48:35,123 --> 01:48:36,849
If you had stayed with
these people for a few days..

1636
01:48:36,873 --> 01:48:37,998
With these people?

1637
01:48:38,165 --> 01:48:41,082
I can see the result in
the form of wounds on your body.

1638
01:48:41,873 --> 01:48:43,707
These are the wounds of penance.

1639
01:48:43,790 --> 01:48:46,457
Don't talk nonsense!
Now get up. You're coming with me.

1640
01:48:46,748 --> 01:48:51,540
I said I can't return
to my previous life.

1641
01:48:52,082 --> 01:48:53,373
Can I know why?

1642
01:48:54,040 --> 01:48:55,332
Vicky.

1643
01:48:56,373 --> 01:48:58,915
Many times you must have seen
this while passing in your car..

1644
01:48:59,915 --> 01:49:02,207
Children eating from the trash.

1645
01:49:03,832 --> 01:49:05,415
'What is the state of this country?'

1646
01:49:06,165 --> 01:49:07,873
You said it and turned away..

1647
01:49:08,582 --> 01:49:10,540
And went ahead in the car.

1648
01:49:11,665 --> 01:49:13,457
And in a while you forgot everything.

1649
01:49:15,207 --> 01:49:16,891
If some day you had
got down from your car..

1650
01:49:16,915 --> 01:49:18,332
To see them closely..

1651
01:49:19,082 --> 01:49:21,915
You couldn't have
sat in a car again.

1652
01:49:22,873 --> 01:49:24,582
The same has happened with me.

1653
01:49:25,290 --> 01:49:28,332
I got down from the car
and went to see them closely..

1654
01:49:28,415 --> 01:49:32,540
And then I couldn't
sit in the car again.

1655
01:49:34,665 --> 01:49:36,207
This means..

1656
01:49:36,623 --> 01:49:38,373
These people are
more important to you?

1657
01:49:38,457 --> 01:49:42,665
No. After loving them
I've learnt to love life.

1658
01:49:42,748 --> 01:49:44,998
Enough. There's no
need to say anything more.

1659
01:49:45,873 --> 01:49:49,165
Tell me clearly,
will you come with me or not?

1660
01:49:49,540 --> 01:49:54,873
Can't you come to me? Here?

1661
01:49:56,165 --> 01:49:57,457
I got my answer.

1662
01:49:58,957 --> 01:50:00,123
Thank you.

1663
01:50:01,248 --> 01:50:02,582
Thank you very much.

1664
01:50:09,582 --> 01:50:11,516
You saw him going to
the colony with your own eyes?

1665
01:50:11,540 --> 01:50:12,540
Yes, sir.

1666
01:50:12,582 --> 01:50:16,123
Junior boss did do the right thing.

1667
01:50:16,207 --> 01:50:18,165
The people there are quite dangerous.

1668
01:50:18,832 --> 01:50:20,998
Okay, you can go.

1669
01:50:23,790 --> 01:50:27,707
- What is it?
- My wife is very sick.

1670
01:50:28,457 --> 01:50:30,165
Where do I keep this?

1671
01:50:30,457 --> 01:50:31,665
On this table.

1672
01:50:36,998 --> 01:50:39,540
Thank you. There is a small request.

1673
01:50:39,582 --> 01:50:43,457
Junior boss shouldn't
know whatever I've told you.

1674
01:50:43,540 --> 01:50:45,290
Or he'll murder me.

1675
01:50:45,582 --> 01:50:47,582
- All right. Go.
- Thank you.

1676
01:51:00,498 --> 01:51:01,498
(Door Open)

1677
01:51:04,790 --> 01:51:08,123
- May I know why you exposed Somu like this?
- See.

1678
01:51:08,207 --> 01:51:09,790
Vicky, see this ship.

1679
01:51:10,582 --> 01:51:12,582
A friend has sent it from Indonesia.

1680
01:51:13,248 --> 01:51:15,498
It's made of clove.

1681
01:51:15,582 --> 01:51:19,332
- I've come to ask about Somu.
- It's such intricate work.

1682
01:51:19,415 --> 01:51:25,415
Look. The ship,
the people and everything of clove.

1683
01:51:28,165 --> 01:51:29,498
Didn't you go today?

1684
01:51:30,207 --> 01:51:33,415
Why did you expose
Somu and got him beaten up?

1685
01:51:34,998 --> 01:51:37,332
This isn't the answer to my question.

1686
01:51:37,748 --> 01:51:40,623
- Meaning?
- The meaning is clear.

1687
01:51:41,207 --> 01:51:44,957
I asked you if you were supposed
to leave by today's flight.

1688
01:51:45,332 --> 01:51:46,665
The answer is clear.

1689
01:51:47,207 --> 01:51:49,248
Seeing me you know I've not gone.

1690
01:51:49,332 --> 01:51:51,540
Why! What for?

1691
01:51:53,040 --> 01:51:55,498
I've answered your first question.

1692
01:51:55,998 --> 01:51:57,873
Now you answer my question.

1693
01:51:59,540 --> 01:52:02,540
What was the reason behind
Somu getting beaten like this?

1694
01:52:10,540 --> 01:52:13,207
I regret this.

1695
01:52:15,123 --> 01:52:20,582
I had hoped the
workers will kill Somu.

1696
01:52:20,623 --> 01:52:24,998
- If anyone raise their hands on Somu..
- This is my bedroom.

1697
01:52:25,248 --> 01:52:27,040
If you want to scream,
go to those workers.

1698
01:52:29,248 --> 01:52:31,790
Yes. I'd forgotten.

1699
01:52:32,748 --> 01:52:34,998
There is no place for you even there.

1700
01:52:35,707 --> 01:52:38,248
You had to come running
from there like a dog.

1701
01:52:38,873 --> 01:52:41,748
So much feeling in
your heart for a traitor!

1702
01:52:42,123 --> 01:52:43,582
May I know why?

1703
01:52:43,665 --> 01:52:46,457
- He's a traitor.
- Father, this is my personal matter.

1704
01:52:46,540 --> 01:52:47,724
It happened between the two of us..

1705
01:52:47,748 --> 01:52:49,082
And if a third person..

1706
01:52:51,832 --> 01:52:53,582
But I want to say one thing.

1707
01:52:54,332 --> 01:52:57,290
If anyone raises
his hand on Somu now..

1708
01:52:58,082 --> 01:52:59,457
Then I will..

1709
01:53:02,165 --> 01:53:03,207
Vicky.

1710
01:53:04,623 --> 01:53:07,457
I forgot to give you the good news.

1711
01:53:08,082 --> 01:53:10,915
Doctor has given me the
permission to go to office.

1712
01:53:11,290 --> 01:53:13,498
From tomorrow you'll
not have to go to office.

1713
01:53:37,957 --> 01:53:39,498
Hello. Dhupia.

1714
01:53:40,707 --> 01:53:44,165
Give a notice to Somu,
alias Chander, tomorrow morning.

1715
01:53:44,248 --> 01:53:45,665
Strike.

1716
01:53:45,748 --> 01:53:47,665
We've to reply..

1717
01:53:47,748 --> 01:53:49,373
To the injustice done to Chander.

1718
01:53:49,457 --> 01:53:52,457
- And the answer is strike.
- Yes.

1719
01:53:56,207 --> 01:54:01,040
If anyone is against this decision,
raise your hand.

1720
01:54:08,832 --> 01:54:12,957
Friends.
I feel before going on a strike..

1721
01:54:13,415 --> 01:54:16,873
We must think of the consequences.

1722
01:54:17,540 --> 01:54:20,582
Rates are going up. The rates
are becoming double and triple.

1723
01:54:21,123 --> 01:54:25,623
And this strike could go
on for months without compromise.

1724
01:54:25,998 --> 01:54:28,957
Chander, we've seen years of hunger,
not just months.

1725
01:54:29,040 --> 01:54:30,248
We can still do that.

1726
01:54:30,332 --> 01:54:32,832
We don't get proper food or shelter.

1727
01:54:32,915 --> 01:54:35,082
We're miserable. We won't fear death.

1728
01:54:35,165 --> 01:54:37,707
- Yes, we're not scared of death.
- We want a strike!

1729
01:54:37,790 --> 01:54:38,998
We want a strike!

1730
01:54:43,248 --> 01:54:44,968
So the factory will
be closed from tomorrow.

1731
01:54:54,415 --> 01:54:56,040
Sir, Mr. Somu has come.

1732
01:55:01,165 --> 01:55:02,665
What work does he have here?

1733
01:55:04,248 --> 01:55:06,165
Sir, what should I tell him?

1734
01:55:07,790 --> 01:55:08,915
Send him in.

1735
01:55:18,123 --> 01:55:19,998
- Traitor.
- Yes, Vicky.

1736
01:55:23,540 --> 01:55:25,207
You had fed me.

1737
01:55:25,957 --> 01:55:28,248
That is why I'm a traitor for you.

1738
01:55:28,873 --> 01:55:30,915
But for the Almighty God..

1739
01:55:30,998 --> 01:55:32,915
- I'm not a traitor.
- Enough.

1740
01:55:32,998 --> 01:55:35,790
Lecture away in that colony.
You'll be praised there.

1741
01:55:35,873 --> 01:55:38,623
How are you?

1742
01:55:39,998 --> 01:55:41,290
Fine.

1743
01:55:41,373 --> 01:55:44,707
Won't you ask how I am?

1744
01:55:44,790 --> 01:55:46,790
What is the need? You must be fine.

1745
01:55:46,873 --> 01:55:49,332
You have many friends.
You're the leader of thousands.

1746
01:55:49,415 --> 01:55:52,290
When you talk, people think
you're God. What else do you want?

1747
01:55:52,373 --> 01:55:54,290
My God.

1748
01:55:58,540 --> 01:56:00,123
Are you still angry?

1749
01:56:01,832 --> 01:56:05,332
Look. I've got a
remedy for your anger.

1750
01:56:09,248 --> 01:56:10,498
What is this?

1751
01:56:10,998 --> 01:56:12,123
See for yourself.

1752
01:56:20,665 --> 01:56:21,707
Has mother come?

1753
01:56:23,582 --> 01:56:25,290
She has sent sweets for you.

1754
01:56:26,123 --> 01:56:27,748
And only a letter for me.

1755
01:56:28,582 --> 01:56:30,915
Sarla has written it.
She has written..

1756
01:56:31,582 --> 01:56:35,998
To not eat even one
without asking brother Vicky.

1757
01:56:38,748 --> 01:56:40,873
So mother does not
know about this yet?

1758
01:56:42,498 --> 01:56:45,165
No, not yet.

1759
01:56:47,582 --> 01:56:48,998
- But when she comes here..
- Somu!

1760
01:56:51,623 --> 01:56:53,498
Whatever happened
between us has happened.

1761
01:56:54,332 --> 01:56:59,415
But don't tell mother about this,
I'll deal severely with you.

1762
01:57:01,707 --> 01:57:03,582
You're the best, friend.

1763
01:57:03,665 --> 01:57:04,748
Shut up.

1764
01:57:07,998 --> 01:57:09,373
Don't call me a friend.

1765
01:57:09,998 --> 01:57:13,790
You're still the same. Innocent.

1766
01:57:14,582 --> 01:57:19,748
And me? I've grown
up suddenly in a few days.

1767
01:57:21,040 --> 01:57:22,290
I've passed the age..

1768
01:57:22,582 --> 01:57:26,957
To get angry with
my friend over petty things.

1769
01:57:28,082 --> 01:57:32,040
Vicky, just think. Think calmly.

1770
01:57:32,123 --> 01:57:33,790
Am I your enemy?

1771
01:57:34,457 --> 01:57:37,998
There is no fight between us.
The fight is between the two classes.

1772
01:57:38,082 --> 01:57:39,957
Were these classes
there when we were friends?

1773
01:57:40,040 --> 01:57:41,415
And even now when..

1774
01:57:42,290 --> 01:57:43,540
What?

1775
01:57:44,790 --> 01:57:46,123
When we've become enemies?

1776
01:57:47,332 --> 01:57:48,457
Yes.

1777
01:57:50,790 --> 01:57:52,165
Shall I leave?

1778
01:58:00,873 --> 01:58:02,040
All right, bye.

1779
01:58:03,915 --> 01:58:05,457
- Hello.
- Hello.

1780
01:58:05,790 --> 01:58:08,457
Are you Mr. Somu? Vicky's friend?

1781
01:58:13,665 --> 01:58:18,123
Vicky is my friend, but nowadays
we're not on talking terms.

1782
01:58:18,332 --> 01:58:20,082
Thank God you came. He's very lonely.

1783
01:58:20,165 --> 01:58:21,915
Will you please shut up and get out?

1784
01:58:38,457 --> 01:58:42,373
In your screaming I
could hear sobbing, Vicky.

1785
01:58:42,457 --> 01:58:44,373
Don't mock my weakness.

1786
01:58:45,540 --> 01:58:46,790
Weakness?

1787
01:58:47,665 --> 01:58:50,165
This is the best part about you.

1788
01:58:51,082 --> 01:58:52,748
Even now, like your friend..

1789
01:58:53,082 --> 01:58:55,540
You can love other
more than yourself.

1790
01:58:57,207 --> 01:59:01,165
The only difference is,
Somu's love is taking him forward..

1791
01:59:01,957 --> 01:59:03,207
But you're stuck in sadness.

1792
01:59:03,290 --> 01:59:05,790
Nisha, don't recite your poetry to me.

1793
01:59:09,957 --> 01:59:14,165
I felt like talking
to him for sometime.

1794
01:59:14,248 --> 01:59:17,123
Why? Could you hear
poetry in his talks?

1795
01:59:17,207 --> 01:59:19,332
Or your socialism?

1796
01:59:20,707 --> 01:59:22,040
No.

1797
01:59:23,165 --> 01:59:26,082
We all just breathe.

1798
01:59:26,957 --> 01:59:28,207
He was alive.

1799
01:59:28,915 --> 01:59:31,707
- Out of this sin..
- Sin? What sin?

1800
01:59:33,248 --> 01:59:36,165
Vicky, in today's society no one can..

1801
01:59:36,540 --> 01:59:39,790
Be honest and become a millionaire.

1802
01:59:40,582 --> 01:59:43,332
If we assume that it's possible..

1803
01:59:44,248 --> 01:59:46,498
Then with poverty all around..

1804
01:59:47,415 --> 01:59:49,790
It's a sin to horde money.

1805
01:59:50,873 --> 01:59:54,373
In spite of knowing this,
we're afraid to lose everything..

1806
01:59:54,790 --> 01:59:56,248
So we side with this sin.

1807
01:59:57,165 --> 02:00:00,498
But Mr. Somu,
in the hope of getting everything..

1808
02:00:01,165 --> 02:00:05,332
Left this sin and is trying
to live like a human being.

1809
02:00:07,665 --> 02:00:11,165
There was only one way of
staying in your class with you.

1810
02:00:12,998 --> 02:00:17,915
In your cheap words you call it,
"as being your stooge."

1811
02:00:20,457 --> 02:00:21,957
Would you like this?

1812
02:00:26,790 --> 02:00:31,540
It's good that he learnt
to live without you.

1813
02:00:32,748 --> 02:00:34,498
Yes, it's good.

1814
02:00:35,207 --> 02:00:36,998
It's good that he learnt first.

1815
02:00:38,915 --> 02:00:42,832
It would've been better
if I had learnt before him.

1816
02:00:47,290 --> 02:00:48,290
Nisha.

1817
02:00:49,582 --> 02:00:53,832
Here I feel you very near to me.

1818
02:00:58,207 --> 02:01:02,790
Because only you understand my friend.

1819
02:01:07,040 --> 02:01:09,790
You were saying this strike
would end in seven days.

1820
02:01:10,248 --> 02:01:11,998
In three days these
people will go weak.

1821
02:01:12,290 --> 02:01:14,748
But what happened?
Today it's nearly a month.

1822
02:01:14,832 --> 02:01:17,332
People are dying of hunger,
of illnesses.

1823
02:01:17,415 --> 02:01:19,332
But what to do? They won't concede.

1824
02:01:19,415 --> 02:01:21,623
Have you seen today's headlines?

1825
02:01:22,665 --> 02:01:26,040
God willing,
this war can't be avoided.

1826
02:01:26,498 --> 02:01:28,123
War is inevitable.

1827
02:01:29,832 --> 02:01:34,457
And war means money, earning.

1828
02:01:35,623 --> 02:01:37,457
How many such
opportunities come in life?

1829
02:01:37,832 --> 02:01:40,123
And this isn't a world
war which will go on for years.

1830
02:01:40,373 --> 02:01:43,540
It's a question of a week,
ten days or a month.

1831
02:01:43,582 --> 02:01:46,832
- Should we lose that?
- This is right, but what to do?

1832
02:01:55,873 --> 02:01:59,040
Call them and compromise.

1833
02:02:00,248 --> 02:02:01,873
As of now, agree to all the demands.

1834
02:02:02,873 --> 02:02:05,290
We'll see after the war.

1835
02:02:07,248 --> 02:02:10,832
And listen,
as soon as the strike ends..

1836
02:02:11,207 --> 02:02:14,082
Get rid of both Somu and Bipin Lal.

1837
02:02:14,290 --> 02:02:17,373
If we get rid of them,
there will be a strike again.

1838
02:02:17,665 --> 02:02:19,665
What has happened to
your intelligence, Dhupia?

1839
02:02:20,415 --> 02:02:21,707
Don't you read the newspaper?

1840
02:02:22,540 --> 02:02:24,248
So many things happen in the world.

1841
02:02:24,623 --> 02:02:26,082
Many accidents take place.

1842
02:02:26,623 --> 02:02:29,540
Someone comes under a lorry or a car.

1843
02:02:30,498 --> 02:02:32,665
Go and do your work.

1844
02:02:49,623 --> 02:02:52,498
It's the 33rd day of the strike.

1845
02:02:52,540 --> 02:02:55,873
We've made with our strength
for three days to thirty days.

1846
02:02:56,290 --> 02:02:59,040
This is the time to
take care and to be careful.

1847
02:02:59,540 --> 02:03:02,248
But remember.
If we lose our grip now..

1848
02:03:02,332 --> 02:03:04,082
We'll get nothing.

1849
02:03:04,540 --> 02:03:08,790
Friends,
no worker wants to go on strike.

1850
02:03:09,332 --> 02:03:12,415
No worker has food
for a month in his house.

1851
02:03:12,748 --> 02:03:15,582
But we still have to go on strike.

1852
02:03:15,665 --> 02:03:19,207
And with the strike
we show the bosses..

1853
02:03:19,290 --> 02:03:21,957
- We aren't as weak as they think we are.
- Yes.

1854
02:03:23,540 --> 02:03:25,207
Junior boss.

1855
02:03:26,332 --> 02:03:27,957
It's a disaster!

1856
02:03:33,540 --> 02:03:38,540
- Who told you?
- Do not ask me. Save your friend's life.

1857
02:03:38,582 --> 02:03:39,790
He's a very nice man.

1858
02:03:39,873 --> 02:03:42,623
First tell me, who wants to kill him?

1859
02:03:42,998 --> 02:03:44,998
- I won't tell you.
- Who is that?

1860
02:03:45,457 --> 02:03:47,498
You're unnecessarily wasting time.

1861
02:03:48,998 --> 02:03:49,998
Dad?

1862
02:03:51,207 --> 02:03:52,373
Sir told you?

1863
02:03:52,457 --> 02:03:53,998
Why are you after the name?

1864
02:03:54,082 --> 02:03:56,832
Do you want the name
or your friend's life?

1865
02:03:59,082 --> 02:04:01,165
- Here.
- No.

1866
02:04:01,623 --> 02:04:03,832
This time I've not come as a broker.

1867
02:04:04,290 --> 02:04:07,707
For the first time in
my life I'm talking honestly.

1868
02:04:08,248 --> 02:04:09,790
I do not want money.

1869
02:04:15,123 --> 02:04:18,457
- What are you doing here?
- It's over.

1870
02:04:18,540 --> 02:04:20,123
- What?
- Waiting.

1871
02:04:20,207 --> 02:04:22,582
- I was waiting here.
- Why?

1872
02:04:22,957 --> 02:04:26,123
The strike is in the Mill.
There is no ban on our meeting.

1873
02:04:26,415 --> 02:04:30,332
Do you know you've not
spoken properly to me in a month?

1874
02:04:30,415 --> 02:04:34,165
You know how much work
is there during a strike?

1875
02:04:34,415 --> 02:04:36,498
In the Mill you've to work one shift.

1876
02:04:36,582 --> 02:04:37,832
In the strike, it's three.

1877
02:04:37,915 --> 02:04:40,248
We've to think and
take care of everyone.

1878
02:04:40,332 --> 02:04:42,665
Yes, except Shama.

1879
02:04:43,415 --> 02:04:45,290
Don't you have to care for yourself?

1880
02:04:45,373 --> 02:04:46,693
What if something happens to you?

1881
02:04:46,957 --> 02:04:48,998
You know there is a
danger to life in a strike?

1882
02:04:49,082 --> 02:04:50,415
Who cares about life?

1883
02:04:50,623 --> 02:04:54,082
If one Somu dies, ten will take birth.

1884
02:04:55,415 --> 02:04:57,707
What if something
happens to my Chander?

1885
02:04:59,082 --> 02:05:01,332
There won't be anyone for me.

1886
02:05:01,998 --> 02:05:06,040
You're a worker's girl,
yet you talk like cowards.

1887
02:05:06,498 --> 02:05:08,178
Are we only fighting
for our own happiness?

1888
02:05:08,665 --> 02:05:10,665
Isn't everyone's
happiness our happiness?

1889
02:05:13,748 --> 02:05:15,832
Make good food for me.

1890
02:05:16,207 --> 02:05:19,915
Good? How can I make
good food in this strike?

1891
02:05:20,332 --> 02:05:23,957
Whatever you make will be good.

1892
02:05:24,373 --> 02:05:26,915
Now go. I'll just come.

1893
02:05:28,040 --> 02:05:29,165
Go.

1894
02:05:36,665 --> 02:05:39,099
Has anyone seen Chander?
This telegram has come since morning.

1895
02:05:39,123 --> 02:05:40,873
His mother and sister
are coming today.

1896
02:05:40,957 --> 02:05:42,957
I saw Chander going there.

1897
02:05:43,040 --> 02:05:44,123
- There?
- Yes.

1898
02:05:44,415 --> 02:05:46,373
The train must've arrived.

1899
02:06:07,123 --> 02:06:08,457
Somu!

1900
02:06:14,373 --> 02:06:17,415
(Crowd Chattering)

1901
02:06:40,332 --> 02:06:43,623
Mother, you'll have to go
on foot from here. It's nearby.

1902
02:06:44,707 --> 02:06:47,123
Child, come here. Take this luggage.

1903
02:06:49,957 --> 02:06:51,677
- Has someone gone to call Bipin Lal?
- Yes.

1904
02:06:51,873 --> 02:06:53,957
- Call the ambulance.
- Okay.

1905
02:06:56,790 --> 02:06:57,790
Somu!

1906
02:06:58,498 --> 02:06:59,498
Somu!

1907
02:07:00,957 --> 02:07:02,082
Look here, Somu.

1908
02:07:03,040 --> 02:07:04,040
Somu.

1909
02:07:09,707 --> 02:07:10,707
Somu.

1910
02:07:11,248 --> 02:07:14,582
I am Vicky.

1911
02:07:26,123 --> 02:07:27,123
Yes.

1912
02:07:27,207 --> 02:07:29,248
- Vicky.
- Yes Somu.

1913
02:07:29,998 --> 02:07:31,623
I just came Somu.

1914
02:07:31,707 --> 02:07:36,623
You told me that why
I could not come to you.

1915
02:07:37,290 --> 02:07:39,582
I reached Somu.

1916
02:07:41,123 --> 02:07:43,123
- Vicky.
- Yes Somu.

1917
02:07:45,082 --> 02:07:46,998
Did you come Vicky?

1918
02:07:47,082 --> 02:07:48,248
Yes.

1919
02:07:51,873 --> 02:07:53,582
- Vicky.
- Yes Somu.

1920
02:07:54,998 --> 02:07:57,915
Take care of them.

1921
02:08:00,957 --> 02:08:04,540
Now is your responsibility.

1922
02:08:04,582 --> 02:08:08,040
Yes, I take the responsibility.

1923
02:08:08,123 --> 02:08:09,832
I take the responsibility.

1924
02:08:10,790 --> 02:08:12,082
I swear, Somu.

1925
02:08:12,165 --> 02:08:13,582
I swear, Somu.

1926
02:08:16,873 --> 02:08:17,957
Somu.

1927
02:08:22,373 --> 02:08:23,415
Somu.

1928
02:08:25,332 --> 02:08:26,498
Somu.

1929
02:08:27,082 --> 02:08:28,165
What happened?

1930
02:08:43,457 --> 02:08:45,290
No!

1931
02:08:48,332 --> 02:08:51,540
(Crying)

1932
02:08:57,915 --> 02:09:00,582
Listen, son. Where does Somu stay?

1933
02:09:02,248 --> 02:09:03,373
You?

1934
02:09:03,457 --> 02:09:05,373
I am his mother.

1935
02:09:06,540 --> 02:09:08,540
Why? What happened?

1936
02:09:08,873 --> 02:09:10,540
Where did Somu stay?

1937
02:09:20,373 --> 02:09:23,165
Brother! Brother!

1938
02:09:24,957 --> 02:09:26,207
Brother!

1939
02:09:31,957 --> 02:09:33,123
Brother!

1940
02:09:35,040 --> 02:09:40,582
- Tell me!
- Tell me who sent you.

1941
02:09:40,623 --> 02:09:42,707
Tell us.

1942
02:09:44,165 --> 02:09:45,540
I'll tell you.

1943
02:09:45,582 --> 02:09:47,165
He gave me money.

1944
02:09:47,248 --> 02:09:49,040
He gave me money.

1945
02:09:49,123 --> 02:09:51,665
- Who sent you?
- I sent him.

1946
02:09:53,290 --> 02:09:56,123
Yes. I'm responsible for this murder.

1947
02:09:56,832 --> 02:09:58,123
He was a traitor.

1948
02:09:58,207 --> 02:09:59,623
He was a traitor.

1949
02:10:00,457 --> 02:10:03,873
Your Honour,
I got him here to help me.

1950
02:10:04,290 --> 02:10:07,832
But instead of helping me,
he became my enemy.

1951
02:10:08,748 --> 02:10:09,790
And I..

1952
02:10:24,248 --> 02:10:25,832
Greetings, Mr. Bipin Lal.

1953
02:10:30,332 --> 02:10:31,832
Fourteen years, Vicky?

1954
02:10:32,957 --> 02:10:34,248
Fourteen years...

1955
02:10:34,332 --> 02:10:36,373
I've not called you
here to cry, Nisha.

1956
02:10:37,957 --> 02:10:40,290
I want to give you a responsibility.

1957
02:10:43,207 --> 02:10:45,123
Take care of mother and Sarla.

1958
02:10:50,165 --> 02:10:53,832
Mr. Bipin Lal, you came here.
Thanks a lot.

1959
02:10:54,665 --> 02:10:57,040
If I tell you why
I've called you here..

1960
02:10:57,540 --> 02:10:58,915
You might laugh.

1961
02:10:59,207 --> 02:11:00,623
No, son. Tell me.

1962
02:11:01,540 --> 02:11:04,207
I promised to Somu
while he was dying..

1963
02:11:05,207 --> 02:11:07,957
To continue his fight.

1964
02:11:08,873 --> 02:11:10,332
That fight should continue.

1965
02:11:12,040 --> 02:11:13,290
Yes.

1966
02:11:13,623 --> 02:11:16,415
Even if you hadn't said yes,
I would've continued it.

1967
02:11:16,873 --> 02:11:17,957
Good.

1968
02:11:20,290 --> 02:11:21,498
How's your daddy, Nisha?

1969
02:11:22,665 --> 02:11:25,582
The day you gave
yourself to the police..

1970
02:11:26,290 --> 02:11:28,748
He suffered his third heart attack.

1971
02:11:29,915 --> 02:11:33,582
He was between life
and death for a few days.

1972
02:11:35,790 --> 02:11:39,415
Till yesterday we
hadn't told him anything.

1973
02:11:40,540 --> 02:11:43,790
But today he knows everything.

1974
02:11:44,873 --> 02:11:50,582
After knowing that,
he's in such a bad state that..

1975
02:11:51,082 --> 02:11:54,998
I feel the day he got the attack..

1976
02:11:55,790 --> 02:11:57,332
He should've..

1977
02:12:01,790 --> 02:12:05,123
Vicky, he has come to meet you today.

1978
02:12:05,957 --> 02:12:06,974
Why did you let him come here?

1979
02:12:06,998 --> 02:12:09,540
Vicky, meet him once.

1980
02:12:10,332 --> 02:12:11,790
He won't live for long.

1981
02:12:12,582 --> 02:12:14,790
Yes, son. Meet him.

1982
02:12:55,248 --> 02:12:56,457
Hello, Dad.

1983
02:12:56,748 --> 02:12:58,415
Why did you do this?

1984
02:13:00,290 --> 02:13:01,582
To save me?

1985
02:13:01,623 --> 02:13:02,832
No, Dad.

1986
02:13:03,082 --> 02:13:05,165
I know you would've
easily saved yourself..

1987
02:13:05,248 --> 02:13:06,873
With your money and influence.

1988
02:13:08,582 --> 02:13:09,790
I didn't want that.

1989
02:13:14,665 --> 02:13:18,248
When I was three years old,
mother died.

1990
02:13:25,582 --> 02:13:28,582
You brought me up.

1991
02:13:29,707 --> 02:13:31,415
But you couldn't give me love.

1992
02:13:33,040 --> 02:13:35,332
Because you were more
busy in making money.

1993
02:13:37,623 --> 02:13:41,207
This is the family where
I got a friend like a brother.

1994
02:13:41,915 --> 02:13:45,707
I got a sister, a mother and love.

1995
02:13:47,248 --> 02:13:49,873
You didn't only take
my friend from me..

1996
02:13:50,332 --> 02:13:51,915
But a son from a mother..

1997
02:13:52,540 --> 02:13:54,290
And a brother from a sister.

1998
02:13:55,748 --> 02:13:58,290
So I want you to suffer
till you're alive.

1999
02:13:58,582 --> 02:14:00,998
You should get double my punishment.

2000
02:14:09,290 --> 02:14:14,040
Does the son have the right
to pay for his father's sins?

2001
02:14:19,040 --> 02:14:22,540
Go. Go home.

2002
02:14:23,623 --> 02:14:24,623
Please.

2003
02:14:24,832 --> 02:14:25,873
Please.

2004
02:14:26,748 --> 02:14:27,832
Leave me alone.

2005
02:14:35,207 --> 02:14:36,207
Dad.

2006
02:14:44,415 --> 02:14:45,582
Take care of yourself.

2007
02:15:03,165 --> 02:15:05,457
- Uncle!
- Sir.

2008
02:15:14,498 --> 02:15:15,498
Son.

2009
02:15:15,998 --> 02:15:18,498
(Crying)
