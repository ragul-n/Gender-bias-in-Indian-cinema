1
00:02:11,918 --> 00:02:14,585
Sir, this is Vikas Shankar

2
00:02:15,751 --> 00:02:17,001
Mr. Ramesh Tyagi

3
00:02:18,418 --> 00:02:19,960
Mr.Vedant Chaudhw

4
00:02:21,043 --> 00:02:22,751
Mr. Agnivesh Katariya

5
00:02:23,668 --> 00:02:25,251
Mr. Junaid Ahmed

6
00:02:26,043 --> 00:02:27,626
And Mr. Ashwin Kumar

7
00:02:28,168 --> 00:02:29,001
Nandhari Killings?

8
00:02:29,876 --> 00:02:31,126
Sir Telgi scam.

9
00:02:32,168 --> 00:02:33,085
Well done Mr. Kumar!

10
00:02:33,793 --> 00:02:34,751
We are proud of you

11
00:02:35,126 --> 00:02:35,710
Thank you Sir

12
00:02:45,501 --> 00:02:49,001
Sir you know, I have seen the files.

13
00:02:49,918 --> 00:02:51,876
I understand... I'll talk to him.

14
00:02:52,418 --> 00:02:53,251
But where is he?

15
00:02:54,293 --> 00:02:55,376
There he is!

16
00:02:57,168 --> 00:02:58,460
Sir...
- I told you...

17
00:02:59,126 --> 00:03:00,501
...he'd be hiding somewhere...

18
00:03:00,501 --> 00:03:01,835
...and playing his game.

19
00:03:03,168 --> 00:03:04,876
The Minister wanted to meet you...

20
00:03:05,043 --> 00:03:06,751
...but you were nowhere to be found.

21
00:03:07,043 --> 00:03:08,626
Sir, I'd told Mr. Pillai about

22
00:03:08,793 --> 00:03:10,126
my reservation in taking that case.

23
00:03:10,293 --> 00:03:12,043
And I told Mr Secretary that,

24
00:03:12,043 --> 00:03:12,876
Didn't I tell you...

25
00:03:13,085 --> 00:03:14,501
...ordinary murder cases are

26
00:03:14,501 --> 00:03:16,876
way below Ashwin's standards.

27
00:03:17,043 --> 00:03:20,501
Look Ashwin... It's not an
ordinary murder case any more

28
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:23,460
The entire middle class
society is shaken up.

29
00:03:24,126 --> 00:03:27,001
How can a father
murder his own daughter?

30
00:03:28,001 --> 00:03:28,501
I know...

31
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:31,876
And even if it's true,
as the police say,

32
00:03:32,668 --> 00:03:35,085
...till the CDI does not verify it...

33
00:03:35,751 --> 00:03:39,335
The issue will remain stuck
like a fishbone in our throat.

34
00:03:39,876 --> 00:03:42,126
And he tells me you're
the best person

35
00:03:42,293 --> 00:03:44,835
to handle this for faster results
- No that's not true...

36
00:03:45,001 --> 00:03:46,751
The files are in your car.

37
00:03:48,168 --> 00:03:49,501
Sir may I ask you something?

38
00:03:50,793 --> 00:03:52,751
Whose idea was it to make the CDI?

39
00:03:54,043 --> 00:03:54,626
Why?

40
00:03:54,918 --> 00:03:57,460
What an apt date to celebrate CDI day.

41
00:03:58,751 --> 00:03:59,376
1st April.

42
00:04:31,043 --> 00:04:31,501
Give

43
00:04:51,418 --> 00:04:52,501
Enjoy!

44
00:06:06,418 --> 00:06:07,460
Khempal!

45
00:06:09,376 --> 00:06:10,501
Khempal!

46
00:06:11,793 --> 00:06:13,126
Wait a minute!

47
00:06:23,793 --> 00:06:24,751
His phone isn't connecting.

48
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:26,251
Wait five minutes...

49
00:06:26,668 --> 00:06:29,251
Madam, you have the duplicate key?

50
00:06:29,793 --> 00:06:30,126
- Yes

51
00:06:30,418 --> 00:06:32,251
Throw it from the balcony,
I'll go down and catch it.

52
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:34,460
Okay-

53
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:07,501
Basanti!

54
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:09,210
Shruti! Shruti!

55
00:07:10,001 --> 00:07:11,376
Look at what Khempal has done!

56
00:08:20,293 --> 00:08:21,001
Sit... sit...

57
00:08:28,168 --> 00:08:28,751
Sir I had called.

58
00:08:29,293 --> 00:08:29,751
Where's the body?

59
00:08:30,418 --> 00:08:32,001
Here in the bedroom.

60
00:08:46,918 --> 00:08:48,001
Goddamn leeches!

61
00:08:49,168 --> 00:08:49,835
Sorry.

62
00:09:08,293 --> 00:09:09,001
Same girl?

63
00:09:09,793 --> 00:09:10,460
Is this her?

64
00:09:10,918 --> 00:09:11,376
Yes

65
00:09:19,293 --> 00:09:20,001
How old is she?

66
00:09:22,126 --> 00:09:22,876
I mean, was...

67
00:09:23,626 --> 00:09:24,376
Fourteen.

68
00:09:27,543 --> 00:09:28,001
Name?

69
00:09:28,543 --> 00:09:29,085
Shruti

70
00:09:30,376 --> 00:09:31,001
Servant's name?

71
00:09:31,668 --> 00:09:32,251
Khem pal

72
00:09:33,793 --> 00:09:34,251
Your name?

73
00:09:35,543 --> 00:09:35,960
Amrish

74
00:09:41,126 --> 00:09:41,751
You're a neighbor?

75
00:09:42,293 --> 00:09:43,501
She's my neice...

76
00:09:48,126 --> 00:09:49,335
Lift the sheet at least first!

77
00:09:49,793 --> 00:09:50,751
What are you doing Champaklal?!

78
00:09:51,626 --> 00:09:52,210
Come Uncle...

79
00:09:52,751 --> 00:09:54,085
Oh these guys are after me!

80
00:09:55,918 --> 00:09:56,501
Yes Sir...

81
00:10:12,918 --> 00:10:15,585
These vultures arrive before
the murder even happens.

82
00:10:18,043 --> 00:10:18,751
Stay back!
- Move!

83
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:26,960
Jai Hind Sir.
- Jai Hind.

84
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:27,876
Move the bottle.

85
00:10:29,043 --> 00:10:29,501
Sit.

86
00:10:34,168 --> 00:10:35,376
Initial inquiries, Sir.

87
00:10:36,001 --> 00:10:38,501
This is the girl's mother,
that's the father.

88
00:10:42,418 --> 00:10:43,001
So...

89
00:10:45,168 --> 00:10:46,376
Any problems in school?

90
00:10:48,501 --> 00:10:49,460
Any boyfriend?

91
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:53,251
She was 14 years old!

92
00:10:54,876 --> 00:10:55,835
I mean...

93
00:10:58,501 --> 00:10:59,460
Any best friend?

94
00:11:00,501 --> 00:11:01,001
A boy?

95
00:11:03,668 --> 00:11:04,626
Or a girl?

96
00:11:05,043 --> 00:11:06,251
Why don't you understand officer?

97
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:08,501
It's Khempal!

98
00:11:09,668 --> 00:11:10,876
There were four people in the house...

99
00:11:11,501 --> 00:11:13,376
...two are alive, one dead and one missing.

100
00:11:14,418 --> 00:11:16,960
Instead of asking these stupid questions,
go and look for that b******!

101
00:11:18,418 --> 00:11:19,210
Volume!

102
00:11:19,918 --> 00:11:20,876
Sir is sitting here.

103
00:11:21,876 --> 00:11:22,751
Dhaniram...

104
00:11:23,751 --> 00:11:24,335
...listen...

105
00:11:28,043 --> 00:11:29,126
It is the servant.

106
00:11:29,501 --> 00:11:30,710
Send one team to the railway station

107
00:11:31,001 --> 00:11:32,835
...one to his house, and neighbours.

108
00:11:33,501 --> 00:11:34,626
And one to the mobile company.

109
00:11:35,293 --> 00:11:36,710
It's an open and shut case!

110
00:11:42,543 --> 00:11:43,460
5 feet 2 inches.

111
00:11:44,376 --> 00:11:45,376
Weight medium.

112
00:11:45,918 --> 00:11:48,376
Color wheatish

113
00:11:48,668 --> 00:11:50,626
I'm sending you a photo now.
Go and give this quickly.

114
00:12:05,168 --> 00:12:05,876
Tell me...

115
00:12:06,376 --> 00:12:08,710
Sir the Gorakhpur express leaves at 7pm.

116
00:12:09,751 --> 00:12:11,626
That means he should still
be in the city somewhere.

117
00:12:12,293 --> 00:12:13,501
Do you have anyone with you
for identification?

118
00:12:13,793 --> 00:12:14,376
Yes Sir.

119
00:12:14,793 --> 00:12:16,501
Dr. Tandon's compounder.

120
00:12:17,168 --> 00:12:18,126
He's also from Khempa
's village

121
00:12:19,251 --> 00:12:20,251
Good.

122
00:12:21,043 --> 00:12:21,376
Okay-

123
00:12:21,793 --> 00:12:22,626
Okay Sir.

124
00:12:25,043 --> 00:12:27,335
Khempal is a lustful guy.

125
00:12:28,293 --> 00:12:29,251
And quite randy too.

126
00:12:30,293 --> 00:12:31,626
He had a thing for Shruti baby.

127
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:33,251
But he's a grandfather...

128
00:12:33,918 --> 00:12:34,710
...he even has two grandchildren.

129
00:12:35,126 --> 00:12:35,501
SQ?

130
00:12:36,168 --> 00:12:37,501
He too has a heart that beats...

131
00:12:40,668 --> 00:12:41,960
ls this a murder or a suicide?

132
00:12:42,501 --> 00:12:44,168
You still don't know? It's murder.

133
00:12:44,168 --> 00:12:45,251
The servant killed her and ran away.

134
00:12:47,418 --> 00:12:48,876
Carefully... She's a little girl...!

135
00:12:49,543 --> 00:12:50,001
Relax...

136
00:13:03,626 --> 00:13:04,126
- Sir! A byte please! -

137
00:13:07,668 --> 00:13:09,001
- Dr.Tandon!
Why did your servant do this? -

138
00:13:18,751 --> 00:13:22,460
Sir, the whole room is a blood bath.
The sheets are soaked red.

139
00:13:23,793 --> 00:13:25,960
Yes Sir... I'm at Sameer Vihar...

140
00:13:26,376 --> 00:13:27,460
No Sir, don't say that...

141
00:13:28,918 --> 00:13:30,960
I'll... I'll post someone
else here and come.

142
00:13:31,293 --> 00:13:33,210
Yes Sir... Jai Hind.

143
00:13:35,918 --> 00:13:37,001
We've taken the samples right?

144
00:13:37,376 --> 00:13:39,001
So... Can we put them on the terrace to dry?

145
00:13:40,293 --> 00:13:41,126
You can put your sheets...

146
00:13:41,501 --> 00:13:42,126
and your blankets...

147
00:13:43,668 --> 00:13:46,751
...in your cupboards, or lockers
or even where the sun don't shine.

148
00:13:46,918 --> 00:13:47,751
What do I care?

149
00:13:48,918 --> 00:13:49,376
Right sir.

150
00:13:49,668 --> 00:13:50,251
Am I cracking jokes here?

151
00:13:51,126 --> 00:13:52,376
No Sir. Absolutely right Sir...

152
00:14:08,543 --> 00:14:09,085
Sir!

153
00:14:09,918 --> 00:14:10,501
Sir, one minute!

154
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:13,710
There are blood stains on
the stairs and the door.

155
00:14:16,751 --> 00:14:17,835
Gopal, I'll call you later...

156
00:14:20,918 --> 00:14:21,585
You come along.

157
00:14:25,793 --> 00:14:26,376
Key?

158
00:14:27,501 --> 00:14:29,876
It's missing. You can break the lock.

159
00:14:31,293 --> 00:14:31,960
Very good!

160
00:14:33,543 --> 00:14:35,710
Thieves break locks. Not cops!

161
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:38,626
Parched eyes will see water everywhere!

162
00:14:41,251 --> 00:14:42,710
It's just rust, not blood!

163
00:14:43,751 --> 00:14:44,501
And what's this?

164
00:14:45,168 --> 00:14:46,501
On the stairs?

165
00:14:49,668 --> 00:14:50,251
That?

166
00:14:53,793 --> 00:14:54,501
That's blood!

167
00:14:55,918 --> 00:14:56,460
Yes Sir...

168
00:14:56,793 --> 00:14:58,001
I've left Sir...

169
00:14:58,543 --> 00:15:00,376
I'm in the jeep.

170
00:15:46,668 --> 00:15:50,460
Mr. and Mrs. Kumar,
you want a divorce on mutual consent

171
00:15:51,168 --> 00:15:53,960
But before giving you
a 6 month trial separation...

172
00:15:54,668 --> 00:15:57,251
I must ask why you want to separate?

173
00:15:58,918 --> 00:16:00,001
Mr. Kumar?

174
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:02,876
I don't have any reason as such.

175
00:16:04,543 --> 00:16:05,210
Mrs. Kumar?

176
00:16:06,168 --> 00:16:07,585
You filed the court papers didn't you?

177
00:16:08,626 --> 00:16:11,585
If there's no reason to separate then
there's no reason to be together either...

178
00:16:13,001 --> 00:16:15,251
We sleep together and wake up
together for no reason.

179
00:16:16,043 --> 00:16:19,251
Fight for no reason.
Love each other for no reason.

180
00:16:20,418 --> 00:16:22,751
Our relationship died years ago.

181
00:16:24,793 --> 00:16:26,126
And we're rotting...

182
00:16:26,293 --> 00:16:28,876
...in the stench of the corpse...
again for no reason.

183
00:16:30,626 --> 00:16:32,251
We also had affairs...

184
00:16:35,001 --> 00:16:37,668
Would you also like to know whom with?

185
00:16:37,668 --> 00:16:38,501
Not really...

186
00:16:39,418 --> 00:16:40,376
Go ahead, tell her.

187
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:42,585
I will if she grants us the divorce faster.

188
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:45,251
Always great at bullshitting.

189
00:16:57,293 --> 00:16:58,751
Please turn that off.

190
00:17:05,501 --> 00:17:06,335
Hello?

191
00:17:07,501 --> 00:17:08,335
Yes...

192
00:17:09,626 --> 00:17:10,460
What?

193
00:17:18,793 --> 00:17:21,460
We showed him the blood
stains on the lock yesterday.

194
00:17:21,793 --> 00:17:23,210
He ridiculed us.

195
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:24,626
My uncle finally broke the lock.

196
00:17:26,418 --> 00:17:27,460
Mr. D K Gogia...

197
00:17:28,168 --> 00:17:29,251
Retired police officer.

198
00:17:29,668 --> 00:17:33,001
He came as soon as I called him.

199
00:17:33,168 --> 00:17:34,001
Identify the body please.

200
00:17:44,376 --> 00:17:45,376
Took it from all angles?

201
00:17:54,001 --> 00:17:55,251
It does look like Khempal...

202
00:17:56,043 --> 00:17:56,626
Wow!

203
00:17:58,251 --> 00:17:58,876
'Looks like'?

204
00:17:59,793 --> 00:18:00,460
What do you mean?

205
00:18:02,418 --> 00:18:05,501
Worked for you for two years, didn't he?

206
00:18:12,293 --> 00:18:13,460
Can you come up?

207
00:18:14,043 --> 00:18:15,751
I can't come home with the ashes.

208
00:18:17,918 --> 00:18:19,376
Panditji has said not to...

209
00:18:22,918 --> 00:18:24,626
Leave it in the car.

210
00:18:28,668 --> 00:18:30,376
I'm not leaving her alone.

211
00:18:34,668 --> 00:18:37,585
Do you remember what Khempal
was wearing last night?

212
00:18:39,668 --> 00:18:41,585
Pant and?

213
00:18:42,293 --> 00:18:42,876
Er...

214
00:18:45,293 --> 00:18:46,251
A green T-shirt?

215
00:18:59,543 --> 00:19:01,876
Now one with Pankaj...
- Okay.

216
00:19:03,626 --> 00:19:04,710
One more...

217
00:19:10,043 --> 00:19:10,751
Sir!

218
00:19:11,418 --> 00:19:12,376
Sir check this out...

219
00:19:13,043 --> 00:19:13,876
Hold on...

220
00:19:19,876 --> 00:19:20,710
I'll call later...

221
00:19:22,543 --> 00:19:23,251
Would you look at that!

222
00:19:24,126 --> 00:19:25,376
Guess the case is solved!

223
00:19:26,293 --> 00:19:26,710
Pandey!

224
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:30,251
Call the forensics department.
- Yes sir

225
00:19:40,876 --> 00:19:42,251
The body is Khempa
's.

226
00:19:43,543 --> 00:19:44,251
Alright.

227
00:19:45,418 --> 00:19:47,001
And this handprint?

228
00:19:48,168 --> 00:19:48,751
Yours?

229
00:19:52,293 --> 00:19:52,835
Sorry.

230
00:19:53,793 --> 00:19:56,626
The Shruti Tandon murder case
keeps twisting and turning.

231
00:19:57,043 --> 00:19:59,251
A new body has been found today.

232
00:19:59,251 --> 00:20:01,751
Apparently this is the body
of the servant...

233
00:20:01,751 --> 00:20:03,501
...who was presumed to be
the killer until now.

234
00:20:10,001 --> 00:20:10,626
Name?

235
00:20:12,418 --> 00:20:13,126
Name?

236
00:20:13,751 --> 00:20:15,585
Shruti Tandon.

237
00:20:18,543 --> 00:20:19,501
Age?

238
00:20:19,876 --> 00:20:20,835
14 years.

239
00:20:22,001 --> 00:20:22,876
Date of birth?

240
00:20:24,376 --> 00:20:25,376
24th March.

241
00:20:26,543 --> 00:20:27,585
Date of death?

242
00:20:29,126 --> 00:20:30,376
15th March.

243
00:20:32,668 --> 00:20:33,876
Time of death?

244
00:20:42,418 --> 00:20:43,626
Sir?

245
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:45,626
Time of death, please?

246
00:20:48,251 --> 00:20:49,251
Sir?

247
00:21:25,251 --> 00:21:26,626
Sir the killer is very clever...

248
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:29,001
Does that mean we are buffoons?

249
00:21:29,418 --> 00:21:31,001
If we don't do something quick,

250
00:21:31,293 --> 00:21:33,626
like Nandhari, this case too
will go to the CDI.

251
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,876
And if I get transferred...

252
00:21:36,251 --> 00:21:37,251
...I will not go alone.

253
00:21:38,251 --> 00:21:39,126
Either find the killer,

254
00:21:39,501 --> 00:21:40,585
or find another job!

255
00:21:43,418 --> 00:21:44,376
Yes Sir!

256
00:21:51,168 --> 00:21:52,126
Fresh arrivals...

257
00:22:00,793 --> 00:22:02,501
First she was hit on the head...

258
00:22:03,001 --> 00:22:04,126
...with a hammer or a rod...

259
00:22:04,793 --> 00:22:05,335
twice.

260
00:22:06,418 --> 00:22:07,376
She must've fallen unconscious.

261
00:22:07,876 --> 00:22:09,710
Then almost half an hour later...

262
00:22:10,876 --> 00:22:12,835
...very carefully, as if by an expert...

263
00:22:13,251 --> 00:22:15,001
...right at the jugular vein...

264
00:22:15,418 --> 00:22:16,085
...a long cut.

265
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:17,126
number one.

266
00:22:18,168 --> 00:22:20,501
And then for satisfaction,

267
00:22:21,168 --> 00:22:22,751
another small late cut...

268
00:22:23,168 --> 00:22:23,876
number two.

269
00:22:26,376 --> 00:22:27,251
And the servant?

270
00:22:27,793 --> 00:22:28,751
A Xerox copy.

271
00:22:32,626 --> 00:22:33,751
Xerox copy indeed.

272
00:23:03,418 --> 00:23:04,168
What happened?

273
00:23:04,168 --> 00:23:05,001
Sir it's me, Dhaniram!

274
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:06,376
One minute sir.

275
00:23:09,668 --> 00:23:13,043
Sir... a glass broke in the other room...

276
00:23:13,043 --> 00:23:16,043
...you were in deep sleep,
tired after a long day's work...

277
00:23:16,043 --> 00:23:18,335
...and you still woke up, immediately!

278
00:23:18,793 --> 00:23:19,251
SQ?

279
00:23:19,501 --> 00:23:20,001
Sir...

280
00:23:20,418 --> 00:23:23,626
...two people died in the next room...

281
00:23:24,543 --> 00:23:27,376
...yet Daddy and Mommy kept snoring away.

282
00:23:28,293 --> 00:23:29,335
Just think about it Sir.

283
00:23:33,918 --> 00:23:35,085
Check out this email.

284
00:23:37,418 --> 00:23:40,085
This girl is apologizing to her father -

285
00:23:40,543 --> 00:23:43,126
'I'm sorry Daddy, I won't do it again'.

286
00:23:44,293 --> 00:23:45,626
What was this mistake you think?

287
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:53,210
And not just one mistake,
but three of them.

288
00:23:54,251 --> 00:23:56,085
The three mistakes of Chetan Bhagat...

289
00:23:57,751 --> 00:23:58,710
...she was reading this.

290
00:23:59,543 --> 00:24:00,876
We found it in her room.

291
00:24:02,001 --> 00:24:04,126
And here is the internet company's report.

292
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:11,168
They said, even hours after the girl's death...

293
00:24:11,168 --> 00:24:14,585
...the internet router kept
switching on and off.

294
00:24:15,293 --> 00:24:16,876
So if Daddy and Mommy were sleeping...

295
00:24:19,168 --> 00:24:20,126
...and the girl was dead...

296
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,126
...who was switching the router on and off?

297
00:24:24,043 --> 00:24:24,960
The girl's ghost?

298
00:24:29,876 --> 00:24:31,210
Damn right!

299
00:24:36,501 --> 00:24:38,376
There were four people in the house...

300
00:24:38,918 --> 00:24:41,001
...two are alive and two dead.

301
00:24:42,418 --> 00:24:43,501
What are you trying to say?

302
00:24:44,043 --> 00:24:48,376
Just that there were two murders that night...

303
00:24:50,043 --> 00:24:55,585
...and both of you heard nothing...
Not a sound?

304
00:24:57,126 --> 00:24:59,376
The AC in our room is so loud that

305
00:24:59,376 --> 00:25:00,960
you can't hear any outside noise.

306
00:25:01,543 --> 00:25:04,376
Wow that's convenient and
a hell of an AC!

307
00:25:05,043 --> 00:25:08,626
So I guess the noise inside the room
can't go outside either eh?

308
00:25:12,543 --> 00:25:14,793
The horniest guy I know is
actually Shruti's father.

309
00:25:14,793 --> 00:25:15,376
Really?!

310
00:25:15,668 --> 00:25:19,001
The female doctor in his clinic...

311
00:25:19,543 --> 00:25:20,335
Sunita madam?

312
00:25:20,876 --> 00:25:21,376
That's the one.

313
00:25:21,793 --> 00:25:23,126
He used to hook up with her.

314
00:25:23,293 --> 00:25:24,001
Unbelievable!

315
00:25:25,376 --> 00:25:26,710
You loved your daughter a lot didn't you?

316
00:25:30,001 --> 00:25:30,751
And your wife?

317
00:25:32,168 --> 00:25:32,751
What?

318
00:25:33,543 --> 00:25:35,126
Our marriage is just fine.

319
00:25:35,876 --> 00:25:37,085
Of course, of course!

320
00:25:38,668 --> 00:25:41,001
Every man loves his wife...

321
00:25:42,793 --> 00:25:44,376
And if he doesn't, he at least...

322
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:46,626
pretends like he loves his wife...

323
00:25:52,168 --> 00:25:54,126
And Doctor Mrs Nathani?

324
00:25:56,043 --> 00:25:58,501
Did you love her too?

325
00:25:59,251 --> 00:26:01,168
Are you insane?!

326
00:26:01,168 --> 00:26:03,001
Shrieking won't help...

327
00:26:03,418 --> 00:26:04,960
I'm a happily married woman!

328
00:26:05,293 --> 00:26:05,835
I know...

329
00:26:06,293 --> 00:26:09,293
Sir I've also heard
that this loving couple

330
00:26:09,293 --> 00:26:11,335
used to indulge in some sex switcheroo...

331
00:26:12,001 --> 00:26:12,376
What?

332
00:26:14,168 --> 00:26:15,460
You know what they say in English...

333
00:26:16,876 --> 00:26:17,626
You know... switching wives...

334
00:26:18,543 --> 00:26:19,876
...Wife... soap...

335
00:26:20,168 --> 00:26:21,085
Wife swapping?!

336
00:26:22,001 --> 00:26:23,626
How is all this connected
with Shruti's murder?

337
00:26:24,251 --> 00:26:26,876
Oh it is connected... from both ends.

338
00:26:27,751 --> 00:26:29,876
Shruti got to know what you two were up to...

339
00:26:31,168 --> 00:26:32,876
She had become sad...

340
00:26:33,251 --> 00:26:34,001
...always sad.

341
00:26:34,918 --> 00:26:36,126
It's a tragedy dear...

342
00:26:37,168 --> 00:26:39,001
...poor girl was suffering silently.

343
00:26:40,918 --> 00:26:43,001
She could neither tell her friends
nor her relatives...

344
00:26:44,043 --> 00:26:44,960
...so who else?

345
00:26:46,168 --> 00:26:46,585
Khempal.

346
00:26:48,668 --> 00:26:49,376
He was very afraid Sir.

347
00:26:50,793 --> 00:26:52,626
He had even told me his life was in danger.

348
00:26:53,168 --> 00:26:53,876
From who?

349
00:26:55,543 --> 00:26:57,501
It was her birthday 8 days later...

350
00:26:59,001 --> 00:27:00,626
...but we gave her gift early...

351
00:27:02,543 --> 00:27:04,376
You have seen the videos from that night...

352
00:27:05,251 --> 00:27:07,126
...we loved her a lot.

353
00:27:07,418 --> 00:27:08,960
For her birthday she had...

354
00:27:09,918 --> 00:27:11,585
...planned a sleepover...

355
00:27:12,418 --> 00:27:14,126
...with her friends.

356
00:27:15,668 --> 00:27:16,960
Planned what with friends?

357
00:27:18,793 --> 00:27:19,501
Sleep?

358
00:27:22,251 --> 00:27:23,085
What is that?

359
00:27:24,001 --> 00:27:28,751
All the kids spend a night together
at one friend's place. Alone.

360
00:27:30,543 --> 00:27:32,376
Without parents around?

361
00:27:34,001 --> 00:27:35,876
And what do they do the whole night?

362
00:27:39,168 --> 00:27:41,460
You see, all these things...

363
00:27:42,626 --> 00:27:44,251
...are because of the internet...

364
00:27:48,168 --> 00:27:50,085
...it's a wretched place, this internet.

365
00:28:00,168 --> 00:28:02,251
Shruti - that's the girls name.

366
00:28:02,251 --> 00:28:03,001
Correct.

367
00:28:03,876 --> 00:28:06,585
She died on 15th March.

368
00:28:07,001 --> 00:28:08,626
And the time?

369
00:28:09,293 --> 00:28:11,501
They said she died at 2:00 am.

370
00:28:13,918 --> 00:28:14,876
Perfect.

371
00:28:15,293 --> 00:28:17,376
Make me a photocopy of this.

372
00:28:18,168 --> 00:28:20,126
If you didn't kill her...

373
00:28:20,543 --> 00:28:24,001
...how do you know she died at 2:00 am?

374
00:28:37,418 --> 00:28:37,960
Hold it!

375
00:28:38,418 --> 00:28:39,960
We're from the Anti-Corruption Bureau.

376
00:28:41,793 --> 00:28:42,751
Hey Guru!

377
00:28:43,543 --> 00:28:45,626
JK! What are you doing here mate?

378
00:28:46,293 --> 00:28:48,376
Got a deputation coming up.

379
00:28:48,543 --> 00:28:50,501
Okay! Where are you off to?

380
00:28:51,876 --> 00:28:53,501
Probably CDI.

381
00:28:53,918 --> 00:28:54,876
But what are you doing here?

382
00:28:55,918 --> 00:28:57,001
The double murder case...

383
00:28:57,293 --> 00:28:58,376
that young girl and the servant.

384
00:28:58,376 --> 00:28:59,751
Ah yes yes Yes"-...

385
00:29:00,168 --> 00:29:01,335
Just reporting to the high command.

386
00:29:03,376 --> 00:29:04,001
Any leads?

387
00:29:04,376 --> 00:29:05,126
We are working on it.

388
00:29:05,501 --> 00:29:06,626
We have cracked it Sir!

389
00:29:07,918 --> 00:29:08,460
Sorry Sir.

390
00:29:11,293 --> 00:29:14,126
I've got some fine malt for you - imported!

391
00:29:14,501 --> 00:29:15,460
Why don't you come by?

392
00:29:18,376 --> 00:29:19,085
Day after tomorrow?

393
00:29:19,668 --> 00:29:20,585
Done.
- Done

394
00:29:21,293 --> 00:29:22,710
Thank you.
- Okay dear.

395
00:29:33,293 --> 00:29:34,001
It's been 10 days!

396
00:29:34,001 --> 00:29:36,210
What has the police
been doing about this case?

397
00:29:37,293 --> 00:29:38,501
Wait...wait...wait...

398
00:29:38,918 --> 00:29:40,085
We are pleased to announce...

399
00:29:40,668 --> 00:29:43,001
...that we have solved
the double murder case...

400
00:29:43,001 --> 00:29:44,876
...of Kruti and the servant.

401
00:29:45,251 --> 00:29:46,376
Its, Shruti not Kruti.

402
00:29:46,668 --> 00:29:47,335
Sir, Shruti.

403
00:29:50,168 --> 00:29:52,626
Our investigation has discovered that

404
00:29:52,793 --> 00:29:54,376
both the murders have been

405
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:56,001
committed by the same person.

406
00:30:02,418 --> 00:30:05,043
He found Kruti...
I mean Shruti and Khempal

407
00:30:05,043 --> 00:30:08,126
in an objectionable though
not compromising position.

408
00:30:15,126 --> 00:30:15,876
Mr. Ramesh?

409
00:30:22,918 --> 00:30:25,751
We need to get some identification done.

410
00:30:31,293 --> 00:30:35,210
After seeing his daughter
and his servant together,

411
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:40,126
Dr Ramesh killed them both in a fit of anger...

412
00:30:40,543 --> 00:30:45,126
though he is as characterless
as his daughter was!

413
00:30:45,751 --> 00:30:48,793
What I say, he is as characterless,
as his daughter was...

414
00:30:48,793 --> 00:30:49,876
[Reporter] What do you mean characterless?

415
00:30:52,168 --> 00:30:55,960
There's a new twist and a new killer
in the double murder case.

416
00:30:59,168 --> 00:31:02,001
This is a simple and straight case of honor killing.

417
00:31:08,376 --> 00:31:08,960
Nutan?

418
00:31:09,793 --> 00:31:10,585
Where are you both?

419
00:31:10,876 --> 00:31:11,751
Where is Ramesh?

420
00:31:12,626 --> 00:31:14,626
We're in a police building...

421
00:31:15,043 --> 00:31:19,001
...they've taken Ramesh in
for some identification.

422
00:31:19,668 --> 00:31:20,626
Listen to me...

423
00:31:21,043 --> 00:31:22,335
...they're saying he killed her!

424
00:31:22,793 --> 00:31:25,126
They're saying Ramesh killed Shruti and Khempal!

425
00:31:26,376 --> 00:31:26,835
What!

426
00:31:28,001 --> 00:31:29,626
What do you mean? Who is saying that?

427
00:31:30,293 --> 00:31:30,876
Listen.

428
00:31:31,126 --> 00:31:35,001
Police say Shruti and Khempa
‘s murderer is

429
00:31:35,001 --> 00:31:37,335
none other than Shruti's father Ramesh Tandon.

430
00:31:37,501 --> 00:31:40,001
This is a simple and straight
case of Honour Killing.

431
00:31:42,043 --> 00:31:43,376
Where is Ramesh?

432
00:31:43,543 --> 00:31:44,251
He's inside.

433
00:31:44,626 --> 00:31:45,751
Ma'am, you're not allowed there.

434
00:31:45,751 --> 00:31:47,126
What do you mean not allowed?
I'm his wife!

435
00:31:48,543 --> 00:31:49,960
Open the door!

436
00:31:50,293 --> 00:31:50,626
What happened?

437
00:31:50,918 --> 00:31:53,001
My husband Dr Ramesh Tandon,

438
00:31:53,001 --> 00:31:54,501
he's been locked up inside.

439
00:31:54,751 --> 00:31:55,626
There's no one inside,

440
00:31:56,168 --> 00:31:57,126
take a look...

441
00:32:08,168 --> 00:32:08,835
Saﬂsﬁed?

442
00:32:11,626 --> 00:32:13,460
I want to speak to my lawyer.

443
00:32:15,876 --> 00:32:17,960
A lawyer is of no use now.

444
00:32:19,126 --> 00:32:22,251
Confess, and you'll get away
with a lighter punishment.

445
00:32:24,668 --> 00:32:27,376
Yours is the rarest of the rare cases.

446
00:32:30,126 --> 00:32:33,251
You'll be hung, and it'll be
granted by a fast track court.

447
00:32:35,293 --> 00:32:36,835
Why would I kill my own daughter?

448
00:32:37,918 --> 00:32:39,585
I've already told you why you did it.

449
00:32:42,918 --> 00:32:45,501
Should I also tell you how?

450
00:32:48,043 --> 00:32:50,626
You were working on your laptop till late that night.

451
00:32:53,293 --> 00:32:55,335
You drink everynight, anyway...

452
00:32:56,418 --> 00:32:59,376
But that night you had a few extra, perhaps...

453
00:33:03,043 --> 00:33:04,501
Khempal, get some ice.

454
00:33:13,543 --> 00:33:14,335
Khempal.

455
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:54,751
Nutan... help please!

456
00:36:12,293 --> 00:36:17,335
After committing both murders,
you cleaned the blood in the room...

457
00:36:20,251 --> 00:36:24,501
...wiped your fingerprints off everything.

458
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:30,501
The bed... the room...
you dressed it all up very nicely.

459
00:36:33,168 --> 00:36:36,751
Satisfied with everything,
you relaxed with another drink.

460
00:36:42,168 --> 00:36:44,126
Would you like to confess now?

461
00:36:46,918 --> 00:36:47,585
Please...

462
00:36:49,668 --> 00:36:52,876
Please.. let me talk to my wife...

463
00:36:54,043 --> 00:36:54,960
mm)! lawyer...

464
00:36:57,543 --> 00:36:59,543
I didn't do this...

465
00:36:59,543 --> 00:37:03,001
I didn't kill my daughter...
Please believe me!

466
00:37:03,793 --> 00:37:05,710
Sir please!

467
00:37:06,918 --> 00:37:08,876
Please... I did not kill her.

468
00:37:09,251 --> 00:37:10,001
Please Sir...

469
00:37:11,251 --> 00:37:12,001
Please!

470
00:37:14,043 --> 00:37:17,751
This is the compound!
This is where it happened!

471
00:37:18,043 --> 00:37:20,501
Shruti was killed here!

472
00:37:20,876 --> 00:37:24,168
This is the house
where Shruti was born...

473
00:37:24,168 --> 00:37:27,376
...this is the room where she grew up.

474
00:37:27,876 --> 00:37:32,876
This is the room where that
bloodcurdling nightmare happened!

475
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,876
This is where Shruti
was brutally murdered...

476
00:37:36,251 --> 00:37:39,376
...where a father was overcome
by anger and reacted violently...

477
00:37:40,043 --> 00:37:43,418
...when he saw his
daughter with the servant

478
00:37:43,418 --> 00:37:44,876
in a compromising position!

479
00:37:45,168 --> 00:37:48,210
A street dog barking at
night keeps us awake...

480
00:37:48,751 --> 00:37:50,460
...and their daughter was
murdered in the next room

481
00:37:50,626 --> 00:37:52,126
yet they never woke up?

482
00:37:52,543 --> 00:37:55,085
It's not just fishy... it's a fishmarket!

483
00:37:55,626 --> 00:37:57,793
We all have boyfriends...

484
00:37:57,793 --> 00:37:59,751
but an old man?
Yuck!

485
00:38:00,793 --> 00:38:03,835
And suddenly one morning,
our family was finished...

486
00:38:05,751 --> 00:38:09,460
Before we could even mourn over our loss,
they arrested him.

487
00:38:11,501 --> 00:38:13,126
Shruti was Ramesh's everything.

488
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:17,501
He had never even so much as slapped her,

489
00:38:18,293 --> 00:38:20,501
yet the police, media everybody is saying...

490
00:38:24,418 --> 00:38:26,251
I have faith in the legal system.

491
00:38:28,793 --> 00:38:30,876
I hope justice is done.

492
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:32,251
Of course.

493
00:38:32,251 --> 00:38:37,501
<i>the day the sky is unscathed</i>

494
00:38:40,293 --> 00:38:45,626
<i>the face of the moon unblemished,</i>

495
00:38:48,293 --> 00:38:53,626
<i>the day Time awakens</i>

496
00:38:56,293 --> 00:38:59,126
<i>justice! justice!</i>

497
00:38:59,126 --> 00:39:01,710
<i>justice shall be sewed!</i>

498
00:39:04,418 --> 00:39:06,626
If you have just lost your child...

499
00:39:06,793 --> 00:39:10,210
that also under really horrible circumstances...

500
00:39:10,626 --> 00:39:13,376
How can you be so clinical and so logical?

501
00:39:14,126 --> 00:39:17,376
I saw Mrs Tandon's interview
on your channel.

502
00:39:17,918 --> 00:39:21,126
I felt as if perhaps she isn't
even their own daughter...

503
00:39:21,918 --> 00:39:23,293
...she may be adopted...

504
00:39:23,293 --> 00:39:25,585
...I suggest we should have a DNA test done.

505
00:39:25,793 --> 00:39:29,251
DNA test suggests Delhi's famous socialite Shoma Ray.

506
00:39:31,626 --> 00:39:33,001
Blood relation or not...

507
00:39:34,293 --> 00:39:41,751
...the police has no right to defame
such a small child, who is dead!

508
00:39:42,418 --> 00:39:46,210
I think that policeman should not be
allowed to remain on his post.

509
00:39:47,793 --> 00:39:50,126
After going through the case details,

510
00:39:50,668 --> 00:39:55,251
the Home Ministry has requested the
CDI to take over the case...

511
00:39:55,543 --> 00:39:58,626
Based on the findings of the
CD
‘s investigation...

512
00:39:58,793 --> 00:40:03,251
further action will be taken
against whomsoever it may be.

513
00:40:04,793 --> 00:40:07,751
After the embarrassing work
by the police, the CDI team

514
00:40:07,918 --> 00:40:09,626
has now arrived in the area.

515
00:40:09,793 --> 00:40:11,793
The case will now be handled by

516
00:40:11,793 --> 00:40:13,626
CDI joint director Ashwin Kumar.

517
00:40:42,793 --> 00:40:45,751
Doctor, this is the girl's room...

518
00:40:47,168 --> 00:40:49,210
...that's the servant's room...

519
00:40:51,168 --> 00:40:52,710
...lets get cracking!

520
00:41:18,293 --> 00:41:19,710
Found anything?

521
00:41:21,043 --> 00:41:25,460
2-3 bottles of beer and wine,
and some toiletries in the bathroom...

522
00:41:27,168 --> 00:41:29,751
'Serve you parents... take them
to the four holy shrines'

523
00:41:30,793 --> 00:41:34,751
'Feeding a cow would help
rid the house of evil spirits'

524
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:38,376
'Feeding a dog will defeat your enemies'

525
00:41:42,793 --> 00:41:45,001
Did Khempal drink?

526
00:41:45,793 --> 00:41:47,751
Occasionally or everyday?

527
00:41:48,793 --> 00:41:50,751
He never touched alcohol.

528
00:41:52,793 --> 00:41:55,460
He smoked beedis though,
on the terrace.

529
00:41:55,668 --> 00:41:56,376
Sir?

530
00:41:57,918 --> 00:41:59,626
Could you come here for a second?

531
00:42:02,918 --> 00:42:03,751
Okay...

532
00:42:03,751 --> 00:42:05,210
Whose bottles are these?

533
00:42:07,126 --> 00:42:08,835
I don't know...

534
00:42:19,418 --> 00:42:23,376
Sir these bloodstains are not only
between the terrace and Tandon's flat...

535
00:42:24,251 --> 00:42:26,376
...they are on the lower floors
as well, going down.

536
00:42:30,793 --> 00:42:33,876
They could have been made when
the police was bringing the body down?

537
00:42:34,043 --> 00:42:34,751
Possible, Sir...

538
00:42:36,043 --> 00:42:37,501
...totally contrary to the FIR.

539
00:42:38,543 --> 00:42:41,085
That means Khempal walked
to the terrace himself...

540
00:42:42,001 --> 00:42:42,626
...alive...

541
00:42:42,918 --> 00:42:45,835
Ah! We only need some
background music now...

542
00:42:46,168 --> 00:42:47,626
You are truly Sherlock Holmes, Vedant!

543
00:42:47,918 --> 00:42:50,126
You flatter me Sir!

544
00:43:04,668 --> 00:43:05,626
Have a seat.

545
00:43:09,418 --> 00:43:12,751
Ahh goddamn it! You fool!

546
00:43:17,293 --> 00:43:20,126
Dr. Tandon, I'm Ashwin Kumar
I'm handling your case...

547
00:43:23,293 --> 00:43:25,251
What time did you go to sleep
on the night of 15th March?

548
00:43:26,418 --> 00:43:27,960
Around 11 pm...

549
00:43:29,668 --> 00:43:32,668
That night, the internet router
switched on and off

550
00:43:32,668 --> 00:43:34,501
a number of times
between 11:30pm and 6am...

551
00:43:35,793 --> 00:43:37,085
Any explanation?

552
00:43:39,043 --> 00:43:40,001
No.

553
00:43:40,293 --> 00:43:41,626
What time did you wake up
the next morning?

554
00:44:16,251 --> 00:44:17,460
Khempal?

555
00:44:19,251 --> 00:44:20,460
Khempal?

556
00:44:21,876 --> 00:44:23,376
Wait a minute...

557
00:44:45,418 --> 00:44:49,210
The number you've called is unavailable.

558
00:44:53,043 --> 00:44:54,376
His phone isn't connecting.

559
00:44:55,293 --> 00:44:56,251
Sit for five minutes.

560
00:44:56,418 --> 00:44:59,085
Madam? You have the duplicate keys right?

561
00:44:59,418 --> 00:45:00,168
Yes...

562
00:45:00,168 --> 00:45:01,751
Throw them from the balcony,
I'll go down and catch it.

563
00:45:02,043 --> 00:45:02,460
Okay-

564
00:45:31,793 --> 00:45:33,376
Ramesh!

565
00:45:43,918 --> 00:45:44,876
Shruti! Shruti!

566
00:45:57,043 --> 00:45:57,751
- Madam!

567
00:45:58,293 --> 00:45:59,876
Look at what Khempal has done!

568
00:46:26,126 --> 00:46:28,001
- Sir a byte? .

569
00:47:12,543 --> 00:47:15,876
We didn't even get enough time
to cry and mourn her death...

570
00:47:19,293 --> 00:47:20,501
They say...

571
00:47:22,668 --> 00:47:24,376
...after we killed her...

572
00:47:26,043 --> 00:47:28,085
..we cleaned her blood...

573
00:47:29,418 --> 00:47:31,376
...wiped our fingerprints...

574
00:47:47,418 --> 00:47:50,335
...cleaned her private parts...

575
00:47:50,918 --> 00:47:52,251
...and drank whiskey...

576
00:48:22,543 --> 00:48:27,126
I wouldn't even be able to inject
her gums before treating her cavities...

577
00:48:28,626 --> 00:48:30,501
...and they're saying I slit her throat...

578
00:48:31,418 --> 00:48:34,501
There were two murders
beyond your bedroom wall...

579
00:48:36,543 --> 00:48:38,501
...you didn't hear anything at all?

580
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:45,460
I have told the police already
about our bedroom AC...

581
00:48:47,376 --> 00:48:49,460
...it had been faulty since many days...

582
00:48:52,126 --> 00:48:56,626
...it makes so much noise that
it's impossible to hear anything outside.

583
00:49:02,876 --> 00:49:04,460
Sorry... what did you tell the police?

584
00:50:16,126 --> 00:50:16,960
You couldn't hear anything?

585
00:50:17,918 --> 00:50:18,626
Nope.

586
00:50:22,126 --> 00:50:27,085
Sir, a normal AC runs at 50 - 75 decibels,
this AC is reaching 85 - 90 decibels...

587
00:50:27,543 --> 00:50:31,001
...it is impossible for any outside
noise to be heard inside.

588
00:50:40,168 --> 00:50:44,001
Hey Basu! Hope A. R. Rahman
doesn't steal you away from us!

589
00:50:51,543 --> 00:50:52,960
Chief!

590
00:50:54,001 --> 00:50:55,001
There's a bit of confusion...

591
00:50:55,751 --> 00:50:57,626
The bloody hand print on the terrace...

592
00:50:58,126 --> 00:50:59,376
...there's no analysis report on it.

593
00:50:59,543 --> 00:51:00,126
Why not?

594
00:51:00,876 --> 00:51:02,501
No idea what these jokers have done.

595
00:51:07,418 --> 00:51:08,085
Dhaniram?

596
00:51:08,751 --> 00:51:09,376
Yes Sir...

597
00:51:12,001 --> 00:51:12,960
Where has the print vanished?

598
00:51:15,126 --> 00:51:17,418
There was unseasonal rain on 18th March...

599
00:51:17,418 --> 00:51:19,085
it must have washed away.

600
00:51:20,293 --> 00:51:23,626
But the forensics department says they never
got any information about a blood print.

601
00:51:24,376 --> 00:51:25,251
That's weird...

602
00:51:25,626 --> 00:51:27,001
I gave it myself...

603
00:51:27,876 --> 00:51:30,126
...I think there has been some misunderstanding.

604
00:51:31,001 --> 00:51:32,960
You informed Forensics, right?
- Yes sir, absolutely.

605
00:51:33,501 --> 00:51:35,460
How?
- We phoned them.

606
00:51:35,751 --> 00:51:36,501
Who phoned them?

607
00:51:37,418 --> 00:51:38,460
I had told Pandey...

608
00:51:39,251 --> 00:51:41,876
Pandey, you called Forensics, right?
- Yes sir, absolutely sir...

609
00:51:42,293 --> 00:51:45,085
...but my outgoing was blocked
so I told Suresh to do it.

610
00:51:45,418 --> 00:51:49,501
Sir I had gone with you on the PM duty,
but I'd told Qureshi to do it.

611
00:51:50,126 --> 00:51:53,460
- And where's Qureshi? -
He's gone home for his daughter's wedding...

612
00:51:54,668 --> 00:52:00,376
You, bloody good for nothing idiot!
What am I supposed to say to Sir now?

613
00:52:00,668 --> 00:52:02,626
Say sorry to the boss now!
Sorry, Sir...

614
00:52:03,126 --> 00:52:04,876
It's okay. But next time there's a murder

615
00:52:05,043 --> 00:52:06,376
and the killer leaves a bloody hand print..

616
00:52:06,918 --> 00:52:08,335
...just be more careful about it, okay?

617
00:52:08,543 --> 00:52:10,126
- Yes sir... -
Very good!

618
00:52:16,751 --> 00:52:18,876
How do you know
she died at 2:00 am?

619
00:52:22,668 --> 00:52:23,376
Sir?

620
00:52:23,918 --> 00:52:25,251
Time of death?

621
00:52:26,668 --> 00:52:28,626
Sir, if you don't tell me the time of death...

622
00:52:29,168 --> 00:52:31,751
...I cannot complete the rituals
of immersing the ashes.

623
00:52:33,668 --> 00:52:34,335
- Panditji... -

624
00:52:34,793 --> 00:52:38,376
...the death occurred between
11:00 pm and 6:00 am.

625
00:52:39,626 --> 00:52:42,460
You could enter it as 2:00 am.

626
00:52:43,376 --> 00:52:44,585
2:00 in the morning

627
00:52:48,876 --> 00:52:50,460
I just made a rough guess...

628
00:53:08,668 --> 00:53:10,126
I'm going to ask a few questions...

629
00:53:10,293 --> 00:53:12,626
...just answer in
a simple yes or no.

630
00:53:14,793 --> 00:53:16,835
ls your name Ramesh Tandon?

631
00:53:17,376 --> 00:53:18,126
Yes.

632
00:53:19,293 --> 00:53:21,876
ls your wife's name Nutan Tandon?

633
00:53:22,918 --> 00:53:23,376
Yes.

634
00:53:24,376 --> 00:53:27,501
Are you sure your husband has not killed
your daughter Shruti?

635
00:53:28,918 --> 00:53:29,876
Yes.

636
00:53:31,751 --> 00:53:35,835
Did you suspect there was anything
between Shruti and Khempal?

637
00:53:37,126 --> 00:53:38,126
No.

638
00:53:39,751 --> 00:53:42,251
ls your husband short tempered?

639
00:53:43,418 --> 00:53:44,126
No.

640
00:53:44,376 --> 00:53:45,335
- Are you sure? -

641
00:53:46,043 --> 00:53:46,876
Mrs Tandon?

642
00:53:49,376 --> 00:53:49,876
Yes.

643
00:53:50,918 --> 00:53:54,335
When you entered Shruti's room,
was she alive?

644
00:53:55,168 --> 00:53:55,751
No.

645
00:53:56,751 --> 00:53:59,751
Shruti's door could be unlocked
from the outside, only with a key?

646
00:54:00,418 --> 00:54:01,376
Yes.

647
00:54:01,918 --> 00:54:05,876
You left the key in the lock that night?

648
00:54:08,293 --> 00:54:09,251
Yes.

649
00:54:09,543 --> 00:54:10,876
Deliberately?

650
00:54:13,668 --> 00:54:14,085
No.

651
00:54:16,001 --> 00:54:19,126
Do you have anything to do
with your daughter's murder?

652
00:54:19,376 --> 00:54:20,585
No!

653
00:54:41,043 --> 00:54:42,001
What's in this?

654
00:54:42,626 --> 00:54:43,835
Your things...

655
00:55:06,793 --> 00:55:08,251
My things,"

656
00:55:11,793 --> 00:55:13,376
Both of you sign here...

657
00:55:16,293 --> 00:55:19,126
Your trial separation period
starts tomorrow...

658
00:55:28,793 --> 00:55:30,126
Thank you, I'll take your leave.

659
00:55:41,501 --> 00:55:42,626
Have you seen the film "
jaazat"?

660
00:55:44,793 --> 00:55:46,001
No... Why?

661
00:55:49,501 --> 00:55:51,001
Just asked...

662
00:55:54,543 --> 00:56:04,126
[Sings] Some of my things
still remain with you..

663
00:56:06,501 --> 00:56:08,251
So basically we get nothing.

664
00:56:09,126 --> 00:56:14,585
Nope. In such cases everything depends
on the first investigation team...

665
00:56:15,126 --> 00:56:17,751
...and as you can see,
the first team did a bang up job...

666
00:56:18,418 --> 00:56:21,126
Any possible prints or DNA samples,
they're all...

667
00:56:21,501 --> 00:56:25,251
Yes, I know, I know... it's all contaminated,
the crime scene was heavily compromised...

668
00:56:26,543 --> 00:56:29,085
But I don't need a sermon,
I need a solution Dr. Swamy!

669
00:56:30,001 --> 00:56:31,001
I'm so sorry...
- Damn!

670
00:56:35,876 --> 00:56:37,001
Jai Hind Sir.

671
00:56:37,668 --> 00:56:38,751
- Take a seat. -

672
00:56:47,918 --> 00:56:49,126
Whose idea was it?

673
00:56:49,668 --> 00:56:50,335
Which idea, Sir?

674
00:56:51,168 --> 00:56:52,001
The honor killing one...

675
00:56:53,668 --> 00:56:55,126
My experience Sir...

676
00:56:55,126 --> 00:56:56,751
the fruit of days and
nights of hard work...

677
00:56:57,126 --> 00:56:58,460
...it was a very
difficult investigation...

678
00:56:58,751 --> 00:56:59,460
Very difficult.

679
00:56:59,668 --> 00:57:00,876
Ah, 'Investigation'!

680
00:57:03,043 --> 00:57:04,501
So you were the first one
to arrive at the scene?

681
00:57:04,668 --> 00:57:05,460
Yes Sir.

682
00:57:06,376 --> 00:57:07,251
And what did you do?

683
00:57:07,418 --> 00:57:11,251
The servant was missing,
so we began looking for him...

684
00:57:11,668 --> 00:57:14,501
You didn't call the forensics team
to collect prints and samples?

685
00:57:18,001 --> 00:57:19,126
Sniffer dogs?

686
00:57:19,793 --> 00:57:21,001
Err... No Sir...

687
00:57:23,168 --> 00:57:25,126
Was there a cooler
panel on Khempa
's body?

688
00:57:27,793 --> 00:57:28,835
Er... why yes Sir, there was...

689
00:57:29,918 --> 00:57:30,626
Who must have kept it?

690
00:57:31,668 --> 00:57:33,585
Who would have kept it?

691
00:57:39,043 --> 00:57:40,876
So why didn't you take it
for fingerprints?

692
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:47,126
The cooler was heavy and...
I was being treated for haemorrhoids...

693
00:57:47,793 --> 00:57:48,710
Oh! okay 0K3)!-

694
00:57:49,293 --> 00:57:50,376
You're cured now?

695
00:57:51,126 --> 00:57:52,335
From the piles?

696
00:57:53,626 --> 00:57:55,710
I'm better now Sir, thank you.

697
00:57:57,668 --> 00:57:59,460
Shall we check? Take off your pants...

698
00:57:59,918 --> 00:58:00,251
Huh?

699
00:58:00,418 --> 00:58:01,335
Take off your pants...

700
00:58:02,168 --> 00:58:03,085
TAKE THEM OFF!

701
00:58:04,543 --> 00:58:05,501
Dhaniram...

702
00:58:06,168 --> 00:58:09,960
Nutan called Khempal at 6:02 am
on his cell...

703
00:58:10,793 --> 00:58:13,626
It rang, was answered,
then disconnected,

704
00:58:13,876 --> 00:58:15,501
then switched off, right?

705
00:58:18,043 --> 00:58:19,335
Did you follow up
with the mobile server?

706
00:58:20,126 --> 00:58:22,585
The servant was missing, so
we assumed he was the killer...

707
00:58:22,876 --> 00:58:24,876
...and began searching for him...

708
00:58:26,168 --> 00:58:27,710
Well done!

709
00:58:33,793 --> 00:58:34,960
There was a rod here...

710
00:58:35,293 --> 00:58:36,126
...look for it.

711
00:58:39,001 --> 00:58:40,335
Look for the rod...

712
00:58:41,001 --> 00:58:42,251
Take off your pants!

713
00:58:42,543 --> 00:58:43,835
Sir, I've been a cop for ten years...

714
00:58:44,293 --> 00:58:47,251
Strip, and search for the rod...

715
00:59:13,126 --> 00:59:14,501
Sir, I've worked for ten years...

716
00:59:16,168 --> 00:59:18,751
At 06:02 when the phone connected,
where was it?

717
00:59:19,418 --> 00:59:20,835
I don't know Sir!

718
00:59:23,251 --> 00:59:24,876
Within the radius of the crime scene!

719
00:59:25,418 --> 00:59:27,376
Can a dead man answer his phone?

720
00:59:27,668 --> 00:59:28,626
No Sir.

721
00:59:28,793 --> 00:59:30,251
Did you find out who answered the call?

722
00:59:30,543 --> 00:59:31,501
No Sir!

723
00:59:36,668 --> 00:59:39,835
Not a single fingerprint is clear...

724
00:59:40,293 --> 00:59:42,626
You morons call this an 'investigation'?

725
00:59:43,501 --> 00:59:44,751
I'm sorry sir...

726
00:59:45,918 --> 00:59:48,626
You turned the crime scene
into a fish market!

727
00:59:49,793 --> 00:59:52,126
Passers by... relatives... neighbours... journalists...

728
00:59:52,293 --> 00:59:53,876
...all strolling around
like it's a public garden!

729
00:59:57,418 --> 00:59:58,751
If you had a little intelligence,

730
00:59:58,918 --> 01:00:00,126
...even a minuscule ounce of it...

731
01:00:00,626 --> 01:00:02,085
...this case would've been solved right then!

732
01:00:04,793 --> 01:00:07,460
I'm sorry Sir...
I was facing a lot of pressure...

733
01:00:22,876 --> 01:00:25,710
Was any of Shruti's blood
found on her parents' clothes?

734
01:00:25,876 --> 01:00:26,751
Yes Sir.

735
01:00:27,793 --> 01:00:29,126
Any of the servant's blood?

736
01:00:29,543 --> 01:00:30,501
No Sir.

737
01:00:32,293 --> 01:00:34,210
The blood of both the vicitms was
found in the room?

738
01:00:35,043 --> 01:00:35,960
No Sir, only the girl's blood...

739
01:00:36,376 --> 01:00:38,960
The parents had cleaned
up the servant's blood...

740
01:00:43,918 --> 01:00:45,751
What was the color of the girl's blood?
Red?

741
01:00:46,418 --> 01:00:47,376
Must've been red, right?

742
01:00:48,376 --> 01:00:49,251
Yes Sir...

743
01:00:50,001 --> 01:00:51,085
And the servant's was blue?

744
01:00:53,668 --> 01:00:56,501
That's how they must've cleaned only
the servant's blood, right?

745
01:00:56,501 --> 01:00:58,626
By cleaning up all the blue stuff?

746
01:01:01,293 --> 01:01:03,751
Even if a drop of the servant's blood
had fallen in the room...

747
01:01:04,918 --> 01:01:06,626
...and even if they had cleaned it...

748
01:01:07,126 --> 01:01:09,001
...the forensic scientists
would have still found out.

749
01:01:15,376 --> 01:01:17,251
This 'honor killing'...
whose bright idea was it?

750
01:01:24,126 --> 01:01:25,085
Speak up.

751
01:01:27,251 --> 01:01:30,501
Ramesh Sir used to talk
on the mobile phone for hours...

752
01:01:30,918 --> 01:01:32,626
...with Sunita Madam.

753
01:01:34,126 --> 01:01:35,001
And...

754
01:01:37,043 --> 01:01:40,585
Whenever Nutan Madam used to be
out of station for her lectures...

755
01:01:41,918 --> 01:01:47,376
They used to lock themselves
inside the clinic and...

756
01:01:49,001 --> 01:01:49,876
What did they do?

757
01:01:51,668 --> 01:01:52,960
I guess they would chat...

758
01:01:53,751 --> 01:01:55,126
ls that what you guys call it?

759
01:02:01,168 --> 01:02:03,085
Oh Sir, you're funny...

760
01:02:04,418 --> 01:02:06,751
How many years have you
worked with Tandon?

761
01:02:07,668 --> 01:02:10,626
I guess... around four years...

762
01:02:12,001 --> 01:02:13,126
What else did you see?

763
01:02:13,543 --> 01:02:17,585
There was a depression in the cot...

764
01:02:18,251 --> 01:02:20,001
...like someone had sat on it.

765
01:02:21,168 --> 01:02:24,126
A few bottles... glasses...

766
01:02:24,293 --> 01:02:27,376
...and the toilet was so dirty!

767
01:02:27,543 --> 01:02:29,251
Like the Jamuna ghat!

768
01:02:31,751 --> 01:02:36,126
But surely... there were other people
in the house that night...

769
01:02:37,126 --> 01:02:40,210
Did you notice anything unusual in
Dr. Ramesh's behavior?

770
01:02:43,251 --> 01:02:44,126
No, I don't remember...

771
01:02:44,543 --> 01:02:46,835
Anything unusual at work?

772
01:02:53,501 --> 01:02:55,001
Kanhaiya!

773
01:02:56,126 --> 01:02:57,668
Yes Sir?
- What is this?

774
01:02:57,668 --> 01:02:58,626
What the hell is this?

775
01:02:59,043 --> 01:03:00,626
Haven't you learned anything
all these years?

776
01:03:00,918 --> 01:03:02,960
Can't even make a cast properly!

777
01:03:05,418 --> 01:03:07,460
If you can't do yourjob properly
then leave!

778
01:03:07,918 --> 01:03:09,751
This happened a week
before Shruti's death...

779
01:03:10,418 --> 01:03:13,210
I'd never seen Ramesh so angry...

780
01:03:14,001 --> 01:03:14,835
B******!

781
01:03:15,126 --> 01:03:18,960
It was very strange because
it was a very small thing...

782
01:03:21,043 --> 01:03:24,251
All of Tandon's staff... everyone in the colony

783
01:03:24,251 --> 01:03:28,126
servants, maids...
round everyone up immediately.

784
01:03:28,376 --> 01:03:29,126
Yes Chief.

785
01:03:30,293 --> 01:03:32,418
If any of you lie... you'll be held

786
01:03:32,418 --> 01:03:34,376
as accomplice for the murder...

787
01:03:36,668 --> 01:03:37,751
The killer will be hung...

788
01:03:38,501 --> 01:03:39,960
and the liar will
get life imprisonment.

789
01:03:42,293 --> 01:03:44,210
I've already said everything I know.

790
01:03:45,126 --> 01:03:47,876
I didn't have much
to do with Tandon Sir...

791
01:03:49,168 --> 01:03:52,501
At times Shruti baby used to give me

792
01:03:52,668 --> 01:03:56,251
some errands to run and that's it.

793
01:03:56,251 --> 01:03:59,043
Sir, I'm an insomniac...

794
01:03:59,043 --> 01:04:01,085
...that's why I work as a watchman.

795
01:04:02,626 --> 01:04:05,418
Sometimes these people would meet

796
01:04:05,418 --> 01:04:08,251
in Khempa
's room and play cards.

797
01:04:08,918 --> 01:04:10,835
Kanhaiya and Khempal are from the same village.

798
01:04:11,043 --> 01:04:12,585
I don't know anything,

799
01:04:13,001 --> 01:04:15,001
I'm just the laundry guy.

800
01:04:16,001 --> 01:04:17,251
Yes, I have a boyfriend Sir...

801
01:04:18,043 --> 01:04:19,501
...but he's married to someone else.

802
01:04:22,043 --> 01:04:26,626
Sir I think the Doctor only
has committed the murder.

803
01:04:27,293 --> 01:04:30,751
That night no one entered or exited the house.

804
01:04:31,293 --> 01:04:33,126
Whoever won the card game

805
01:04:33,293 --> 01:04:34,626
would buy drinks for everyone.

806
01:04:35,043 --> 01:04:36,001
Yes Sir I remember...

807
01:04:36,876 --> 01:04:38,876
Kanhaiya was very angry

808
01:04:39,418 --> 01:04:40,876
the day the Doctor shouted at him...

809
01:04:42,668 --> 01:04:43,876
Enough is enough!

810
01:04:44,043 --> 01:04:45,960
He called me a b******
in front of everyone...

811
01:04:46,418 --> 01:04:47,126
How could he?!

812
01:04:47,418 --> 01:04:48,335
I will make him pay for this one!

813
01:04:49,126 --> 01:04:52,543
Relax... He just lost his temper...

814
01:04:52,543 --> 01:04:54,626
He's a good man...

815
01:04:54,876 --> 01:04:56,626
I will take my revenge at any cost...

816
01:04:57,043 --> 01:04:58,710
I will show him who the real b****** is!

817
01:05:05,668 --> 01:05:07,251
Are you sure about this?

818
01:05:09,043 --> 01:05:10,668
Sir, whatever the parents have said so far

819
01:05:10,668 --> 01:05:12,085
in the investigation,
has turned out to be true.

820
01:05:13,668 --> 01:05:15,251
Nutan had called Khempal in the morning...

821
01:05:17,001 --> 01:05:19,126
Then the AC sound test in the room...

822
01:05:20,126 --> 01:05:22,460
They even passed the polygraph tests

823
01:05:22,626 --> 01:05:23,876
without a hitch.

824
01:05:27,043 --> 01:05:28,960
You better hope all this
turns out to be wrong.

825
01:05:31,793 --> 01:05:33,251
Or the torture and injustice

826
01:05:33,251 --> 01:05:34,501
that the parents have
been put through...

827
01:05:35,876 --> 01:05:37,876
One won't be able to
make amends for it...

828
01:05:38,918 --> 01:05:40,001
Even“

829
01:05:41,418 --> 01:05:42,501
Ashwin...

830
01:05:44,168 --> 01:05:46,251
Have you seen the statue of justice?

831
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:50,501
It is blindfolded...

832
01:05:50,668 --> 01:05:52,376
..and one hand holds a weight balance...

833
01:05:53,293 --> 01:05:56,210
People often don't notice

834
01:05:56,418 --> 01:05:58,626
that the other hand holds a sword.

835
01:06:01,668 --> 01:06:04,251
The sword in the hands of justice is us...

836
01:06:04,501 --> 01:06:05,460
us cops...

837
01:06:07,168 --> 01:06:09,168
But in the last 60 years,

838
01:06:09,168 --> 01:06:10,710
the sword has become rusty...

839
01:06:12,168 --> 01:06:14,626
And until the rust is cleaned off,

840
01:06:16,376 --> 01:06:20,126
this is how it will be... how it will stay.

841
01:06:23,251 --> 01:06:26,001
I'm retiring on the 19th of next month.

842
01:06:27,668 --> 01:06:28,626
I know...

843
01:06:30,918 --> 01:06:33,251
You have 32 days...

844
01:06:34,418 --> 01:06:36,251
...to clean the rust off the sword.

845
01:06:38,251 --> 01:06:43,376
<i>the day the sky is unscathed</i>

846
01:06:46,376 --> 01:06:51,251
<i>the face of the moon unblemished,</i>

847
01:06:54,418 --> 01:07:00,335
<i>the day Time awakens</i>

848
01:07:02,543 --> 01:07:04,960
<i>justice! justice!</i>

849
01:07:05,126 --> 01:07:07,335
<i>justice shall be sewed!</i>

850
01:07:16,001 --> 01:07:17,835
Nothing in here...

851
01:07:18,835 --> 01:07:19,710
I'll check on the other side.

852
01:07:25,376 --> 01:07:27,501
Basu! Find anything?

853
01:07:27,501 --> 01:07:28,793
Looking Sir.

854
01:07:38,460 --> 01:07:39,460
-Ashwin... -

855
01:07:47,543 --> 01:07:48,793
Please keep this.

856
01:07:59,626 --> 01:08:00,501
Hey...

857
01:08:01,710 --> 01:08:02,460
What... is this?

858
01:08:09,876 --> 01:08:12,210
I think we've found
our murder weapon...

859
01:08:19,585 --> 01:08:20,335
Yes Vedant...

860
01:08:20,501 --> 01:08:22,085
We've got permission for the Narco test...

861
01:08:22,876 --> 01:08:25,001
Good... very good!

862
01:08:34,793 --> 01:08:37,168
Investigative officers are
not allowed in Narco tests.

863
01:08:37,501 --> 01:08:40,001
Doc I'm on the verge
of solving this case...

864
01:08:40,001 --> 01:08:42,418
I just need one breakthrough!

865
01:08:42,585 --> 01:08:43,418
Pestering like a child!

866
01:08:43,626 --> 01:08:45,418
You know I can't help you with this...

867
01:08:45,835 --> 01:08:47,335
Okay, could you give me your phone?

868
01:08:49,043 --> 01:08:50,085
Who are you calling?

869
01:08:52,001 --> 01:08:53,001
Calling myself.

870
01:08:54,751 --> 01:08:56,001
I think he picked up... Please speak!

871
01:08:56,335 --> 01:08:58,251
Hello... Dr. Swamy?

872
01:08:58,626 --> 01:08:59,376
What is this?

873
01:08:59,376 --> 01:09:00,335
This is a live telecast...

874
01:09:00,335 --> 01:09:01,085
Don't hang up...

875
01:09:01,585 --> 01:09:02,835
We're not breaking the law, okay?

876
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:05,501
If I need to ask any questions

877
01:09:05,501 --> 01:09:07,335
I'll text doctor Mohanty.

878
01:09:08,918 --> 01:09:10,626
Thank you!

879
01:09:25,585 --> 01:09:26,751
This is Sodium Pentathol.

880
01:09:27,293 --> 01:09:29,126
You will feel a bit drowsy...

881
01:09:29,793 --> 01:09:32,126
...but you will remain awake.

882
01:09:45,043 --> 01:09:45,918
He is stable...

883
01:09:46,460 --> 01:09:47,710
...you can begin now.

884
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:53,251
Kanhaiya?

885
01:09:54,293 --> 01:09:55,335
Kanhaiya?

886
01:09:56,251 --> 01:09:57,543
Yes Sir.

887
01:09:57,710 --> 01:09:59,960
Tell us something about
Shruti and Khempal?

888
01:10:01,085 --> 01:10:03,543
Was there really something
going on between them?

889
01:10:06,418 --> 01:10:07,168
Kanhaiya?

890
01:10:11,418 --> 01:10:12,168
No Sir.

891
01:10:13,376 --> 01:10:16,876
He loved her like his own daughter...

892
01:10:17,418 --> 01:10:18,043
Then?

893
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:22,085
RP was the one who loved her...

894
01:10:24,543 --> 01:10:25,501
Who is RP?

895
01:10:27,210 --> 01:10:28,543
Rajpal...

896
01:10:30,210 --> 01:10:32,085
Nathani Sir's driver.

897
01:10:32,835 --> 01:10:34,835
When was the last time
you met Khempal?

898
01:10:41,210 --> 01:10:42,418
At the Rockhouse...

899
01:10:43,085 --> 01:10:45,710
What is Rockhouse?

900
01:10:52,626 --> 01:10:58,085
'Resham... Resham... Resham Resham..'

901
01:11:12,335 --> 01:11:15,501
Kanhaiya... pour me another one...

902
01:11:17,751 --> 01:11:18,626
Make another one!

903
01:11:30,626 --> 01:11:32,293
What the hell Kanhaiya!

904
01:11:33,043 --> 01:11:35,793
Worked for so long and still
haven't learned a thing?

905
01:11:36,210 --> 01:11:37,501
This is funny huh?

906
01:11:40,501 --> 01:11:41,501
Piss me off some more

907
01:11:41,501 --> 01:11:42,585
and I'll pull the doctor's entrails

908
01:11:42,585 --> 01:11:43,585
inside out right now!

909
01:11:45,918 --> 01:11:47,085
Quiet guys... quiet down!

910
01:11:47,876 --> 01:11:48,793
Everyone is asleep.

911
01:11:51,460 --> 01:11:52,793
Everyone is asleep!

912
01:11:58,418 --> 01:12:00,293
My love must be awake though eh?

913
01:12:01,418 --> 01:12:03,543
Stop talking loosely about the girl!

914
01:12:04,043 --> 01:12:05,043
She's like a daughter to me...

915
01:12:05,418 --> 01:12:06,876
Sure, like a daughter...

916
01:12:07,418 --> 01:12:08,501
Sorry father-in-law!

917
01:12:11,085 --> 01:12:12,751
That's enough! Leave now...

918
01:12:13,835 --> 01:12:14,501
I need to sleep...

919
01:12:14,710 --> 01:12:16,710
Get some more booze... this is empty...

920
01:12:17,418 --> 01:12:18,168
From where?

921
01:12:18,626 --> 01:12:19,876
From the doctor's bar...

922
01:12:22,835 --> 01:12:23,668
He got scared!

923
01:12:24,835 --> 01:12:26,085
I'll lose my job...

924
01:12:26,835 --> 01:12:28,335
I'll buy you a new bottle in the morning...

925
01:12:29,043 --> 01:12:29,585
I promise.

926
01:12:30,001 --> 01:12:31,918
Wait I'll get it.

927
01:13:27,376 --> 01:13:28,543
What the hell are you guys doing?

928
01:13:29,793 --> 01:13:30,668
Get back inside.

929
01:13:32,376 --> 01:13:33,876
Let's get back inside!

930
01:13:34,168 --> 01:13:35,043
Cheers.

931
01:13:37,210 --> 01:13:38,793
One more drink please
- Are you crazy?

932
01:13:38,793 --> 01:13:40,918
Just one more... Last!

933
01:13:48,501 --> 01:13:49,418
Khemu uncle?

934
01:13:50,251 --> 01:13:51,251
Stop him!

935
01:13:51,251 --> 01:13:52,210
Keep quiet!

936
01:13:55,168 --> 01:13:56,001
Papa!

937
01:13:58,293 --> 01:13:59,126
Quiet!

938
01:13:59,585 --> 01:14:00,418
Make her quiet.

939
01:14:03,668 --> 01:14:05,251
Are you mad!

940
01:14:07,001 --> 01:14:08,210
What to do?!

941
01:14:08,210 --> 01:14:09,085
Hit her!

942
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:20,835
Kanhaiya...

943
01:14:24,335 --> 01:14:25,043
Quiet!

944
01:14:26,001 --> 01:14:26,876
Hold her down!

945
01:14:30,001 --> 01:14:31,501
Hit her hard with the Khukhri!

946
01:14:37,210 --> 01:14:38,085
Kanhaiya...

947
01:14:42,918 --> 01:14:43,793
Kanhaiya...

948
01:14:44,168 --> 01:14:45,751
Did you kill her with the Khukri?

949
01:14:47,210 --> 01:14:49,710
Did you murder her with the Khukri?

950
01:14:51,168 --> 01:14:52,001
Kanhaiya!

951
01:14:52,168 --> 01:14:52,668
Madam...

952
01:14:53,210 --> 01:14:53,751
Please stop!

953
01:14:59,543 --> 01:15:01,876
Call up doctor Mohanty.

954
01:15:06,835 --> 01:15:07,293
Hello...

955
01:15:07,668 --> 01:15:08,585
Hello Ashwin...

956
01:15:09,043 --> 01:15:09,918
I'm at work.

957
01:15:10,418 --> 01:15:11,960
Oh sorry, I'll call later.

958
01:15:12,543 --> 01:15:13,418
No it's ok... tell me...

959
01:15:14,043 --> 01:15:16,626
Do you remember the name

960
01:15:16,626 --> 01:15:18,501
of my migraine pills?

961
01:15:19,626 --> 01:15:22,085
The Doctor is not answering his phone...

962
01:15:24,001 --> 01:15:26,085
Relpax.

963
01:15:27,210 --> 01:15:29,751
Yes, thank you I just
couldn't remember...

964
01:15:32,168 --> 01:15:33,960
Are you watching the film ‘ljaazat’?

965
01:15:36,835 --> 01:15:37,751
Yes...

966
01:15:39,251 --> 01:15:40,460
Chief!

967
01:15:42,335 --> 01:15:43,126
What happened?

968
01:15:43,126 --> 01:15:44,376
His BP has crashed.

969
01:15:47,335 --> 01:15:48,710
Give the phone to Dr.Swamy.

970
01:15:51,001 --> 01:15:51,543
Hello...

971
01:15:51,543 --> 01:15:52,668
Just a little while longer Dr.Swamy...

972
01:15:52,668 --> 01:15:53,918
We're almost there!

973
01:15:54,210 --> 01:15:55,251
- There is a problem...-

974
01:15:55,251 --> 01:15:56,585
I have to stop this!

975
01:15:56,585 --> 01:15:58,085
- It's been more than 3 hours... -

976
01:15:58,626 --> 01:16:01,293
Doctor... It will take weeks to get
permission from the court...

977
01:16:02,126 --> 01:16:02,793
- Please. -

978
01:16:02,793 --> 01:16:03,626
I'm sorry Ashwin...

979
01:16:03,876 --> 01:16:04,835
I really can't help this.

980
01:16:04,835 --> 01:16:05,918
We have to stop this now.

981
01:16:06,376 --> 01:16:07,293
This is very dangerous.

982
01:16:07,835 --> 01:16:09,460
- I'm sorry Ashwin. I can't! -

983
01:16:29,501 --> 01:16:30,335
Rajpal...

984
01:16:31,501 --> 01:16:32,876
Do you watch Rockhouse?

985
01:16:35,126 --> 01:16:36,085
Yes...

986
01:16:38,585 --> 01:16:40,501
Without fail...

987
01:16:41,210 --> 01:16:43,085
When did you see it last?

988
01:16:46,210 --> 01:16:47,918
In Khemu‘s room.

989
01:16:49,418 --> 01:16:51,918
Do you remember which song you saw?

990
01:16:55,543 --> 01:16:58,043
Resham... Resham...Resham...

991
01:17:10,293 --> 01:17:11,168
Rajpal...

992
01:17:12,043 --> 01:17:13,626
Why did you kill Shruti?

993
01:17:15,418 --> 01:17:17,335
Shruti - why did you kill her?

994
01:17:20,710 --> 01:17:22,710
I... I didn't kill Shruti...

995
01:17:23,085 --> 01:17:23,960
Then?

996
01:17:24,626 --> 01:17:27,710
In fact I loved her very much...

997
01:17:31,376 --> 01:17:34,335
Everything went wrong...

998
01:17:34,335 --> 01:17:37,585
...on that drunken night.

999
01:17:37,585 --> 01:17:38,460
What went wrong?

1000
01:17:40,210 --> 01:17:42,210
Kanhaiya was the one responsible...

1001
01:17:43,043 --> 01:17:43,918
Kanhaiya?

1002
01:17:45,293 --> 01:17:47,460
Ask Bhakbhakaun...

1003
01:17:49,543 --> 01:17:51,085
Bak... who?

1004
01:17:52,168 --> 01:17:53,376
Bhak... Bhakbakau...

1005
01:17:54,543 --> 01:17:56,418
He was there too...

1006
01:18:00,793 --> 01:18:02,668
Who is this Bhakbhakaun?

1007
01:18:03,210 --> 01:18:06,335
Bhak.. bakau...

1008
01:18:11,585 --> 01:18:12,918
What the hell have you guys done?!

1009
01:18:13,835 --> 01:18:15,710
Nothing happened! Don't worry!

1010
01:18:16,418 --> 01:18:18,501
Look... look...

1011
01:18:20,376 --> 01:18:21,335
She's breathing...

1012
01:18:21,835 --> 01:18:23,126
...she's still breathing...

1013
01:18:24,210 --> 01:18:25,751
She just got scared and fainted.

1014
01:18:26,085 --> 01:18:27,376
Everything will be okay...

1015
01:18:27,793 --> 01:18:29,335
Hey Bhakbhakaun!

1016
01:18:39,668 --> 01:18:41,876
I'll wake everyone up and
tell them what happened!

1017
01:18:42,251 --> 01:18:44,626
Are you crazy?
We'll all be behind bars!

1018
01:18:45,668 --> 01:18:48,793
Let's go to the terrace
and think clearly...

1019
01:18:49,418 --> 01:18:50,335
You're our brother...

1020
01:18:51,043 --> 01:18:54,335
we'll do whatever you say...

1021
01:18:55,501 --> 01:18:56,543
Come on!

1022
01:19:05,543 --> 01:19:07,210
If you want to run away then run!

1023
01:19:07,918 --> 01:19:10,293
I'm going to tell Sir everything!

1024
01:19:10,293 --> 01:19:12,585
I don't care if I go to jail
or get hanged!

1025
01:19:14,168 --> 01:19:15,210
Khemu listen!

1026
01:19:15,918 --> 01:19:17,126
My uncle is a cop back home...

1027
01:19:17,876 --> 01:19:19,501
Once we cross the border

1028
01:19:19,835 --> 01:19:21,168
no one will catch us!

1029
01:19:21,418 --> 01:19:23,293
You met him at the wedding, remember?

1030
01:21:44,210 --> 01:21:45,543
Who is this Bhakbhakaun?

1031
01:21:47,793 --> 01:21:48,668
No idea Sir...

1032
01:21:53,043 --> 01:21:54,876
Become a witness and you'll be saved...

1033
01:21:56,793 --> 01:21:57,876
It's all a lie Sir...

1034
01:21:58,793 --> 01:21:59,668
- I didn't do anything. -

1035
01:22:00,668 --> 01:22:02,293
You shot me up with drugs and

1036
01:22:02,293 --> 01:22:03,543
made me say whatever
you wanted to hear...

1037
01:22:11,751 --> 01:22:13,668
And made you sing too?

1038
01:22:17,793 --> 01:22:22,418
Resham... Resham...Resham...

1039
01:22:43,085 --> 01:22:43,876
Want to see a film?

1040
01:22:43,876 --> 01:22:44,876
You said some interesting things in it.

1041
01:22:45,543 --> 01:22:49,293
My lawyer says your film
cannot play in court.

1042
01:22:49,960 --> 01:22:50,501
<i>Micidcidtidcicicic‘</i>

1043
01:22:51,210 --> 01:22:51,751
What did you say?

1044
01:22:52,376 --> 01:22:53,168
What does that mean?

1045
01:22:53,793 --> 01:22:54,751
He sang the song right?

1046
01:22:55,543 --> 01:22:56,376
So ask him.

1047
01:22:57,585 --> 01:22:59,460
Don't touch me!

1048
01:22:59,793 --> 01:23:01,960
Hey Vedant wait...

1049
01:23:02,835 --> 01:23:03,668
No... no... don't...

1050
01:23:04,835 --> 01:23:05,668
Don't touch me!

1051
01:23:06,710 --> 01:23:07,626
StOP--'

1052
01:23:09,543 --> 01:23:11,585
If our Welfare Group gets to know,

1053
01:23:11,585 --> 01:23:12,585
they won't spare you...

1054
01:23:21,668 --> 01:23:24,293
It doesn't matter if the film
plays in court or not...

1055
01:23:27,001 --> 01:23:28,543
But your 'The End' is certain.

1056
01:23:33,585 --> 01:23:36,043
Chief! The TV channel has confirmed...

1057
01:23:36,793 --> 01:23:38,293
...that song was telecast

1058
01:23:38,293 --> 01:23:40,085
on their Rockhouse program that night.

1059
01:23:47,001 --> 01:23:48,668
Who the heck is this Bhakbhakaun?

1060
01:23:52,418 --> 01:23:54,293
Call all of them again for questioning.

1061
01:24:04,335 --> 01:24:05,085
Sir.

1062
01:24:05,376 --> 01:24:06,668
Congratulations!

1063
01:24:07,668 --> 01:24:08,918
The blood found

1064
01:24:08,918 --> 01:24:10,626
on Kanhaiya's pillow cover...

1065
01:24:12,085 --> 01:24:13,793
...it matches with Khempa
's blood!

1066
01:24:14,585 --> 01:24:16,418
Great!
- They are sending a formal report.

1067
01:24:16,793 --> 01:24:18,501
Congrats indeed!

1068
01:24:22,293 --> 01:24:24,251
This is my boy!

1069
01:24:24,251 --> 01:24:25,460
My Bond!
- Yes...

1070
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:28,835
I'm your boy... You're happy Sir!

1071
01:24:28,835 --> 01:24:29,876
We'll miss you...

1072
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:32,335
I'll miss you...

1073
01:24:34,335 --> 01:24:35,460
I'll just come...

1074
01:24:38,293 --> 01:24:39,835
So who's going to take over after you?

1075
01:24:40,626 --> 01:24:41,251
JK!

1076
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:49,376
This guy will take over...

1077
01:24:49,376 --> 01:24:52,460
But he'll never overtake me.

1078
01:24:53,710 --> 01:24:54,210
Rama...

1079
01:24:55,251 --> 01:24:56,543
you'll never change!

1080
01:24:57,043 --> 01:24:57,543
And you?

1081
01:24:58,710 --> 01:25:00,085
Will keep changing!

1082
01:25:00,085 --> 01:25:00,960
Like a chameleon!

1083
01:25:03,168 --> 01:25:04,376
Sometimes red...

1084
01:25:05,168 --> 01:25:06,460
sometimes yellow...

1085
01:25:06,460 --> 01:25:07,376
sometimes blue...

1086
01:25:09,043 --> 01:25:13,085
May I request the outgoing director
to come up here on stage.

1087
01:25:13,793 --> 01:25:17,168
Come on, let's make you green now.
-Green?

1088
01:25:17,876 --> 01:25:20,793
The jealous green!

1089
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:22,876
Excuse us.

1090
01:25:39,668 --> 01:25:42,585
My heart is heavy,

1091
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:45,918
and simultaneously light too...

1092
01:25:47,501 --> 01:25:48,751
Heavy because...

1093
01:25:49,793 --> 01:25:51,835
...I can't be with you anymore...

1094
01:25:54,210 --> 01:25:54,876
Light

1095
01:25:55,710 --> 01:25:57,585
...because I don't need to
deal with you anymore...

1096
01:26:00,335 --> 01:26:01,168
No more!

1097
01:26:04,293 --> 01:26:05,835
For forty years...

1098
01:26:06,876 --> 01:26:07,668
I have...

1099
01:26:08,751 --> 01:26:10,418
...just one word to give you...

1100
01:26:12,001 --> 01:26:13,210
Thank you!

1101
01:26:17,293 --> 01:26:19,710
And for my good friend,

1102
01:26:20,418 --> 01:26:23,001
your new Director...

1103
01:26:23,918 --> 01:26:26,293
a Parting gift!

1104
01:26:28,085 --> 01:26:29,293
Ladies and gentlemen...

1105
01:26:30,418 --> 01:26:31,918
During the tenure of yours truly...

1106
01:26:32,876 --> 01:26:35,043
the double murder case...

1107
01:26:36,043 --> 01:26:37,210
...has been solved!

1108
01:26:44,460 --> 01:26:45,335
Well done!

1109
01:26:51,085 --> 01:26:53,168
Hit her hard with the Khukri.

1110
01:26:57,418 --> 01:26:58,751
Khempal called the cops?

1111
01:26:59,668 --> 01:27:05,126
We killed him before
he had the chance.

1112
01:27:06,335 --> 01:27:08,210
How did you kill Khempal?

1113
01:27:10,835 --> 01:27:12,335
With the Khukri.

1114
01:27:23,501 --> 01:27:24,293
Well...

1115
01:27:25,501 --> 01:27:26,960
This is all very good, Ashwin.

1116
01:27:27,376 --> 01:27:27,835
- Congrats! -

1117
01:27:28,043 --> 01:27:28,626
Thank you Sir.

1118
01:27:29,876 --> 01:27:31,543
What is the main evidence
on the chargesheet?

1119
01:27:31,835 --> 01:27:32,418
We recovered...

1120
01:27:32,876 --> 01:27:33,376
Sir...

1121
01:27:34,543 --> 01:27:35,126
Sorry.

1122
01:27:35,585 --> 01:27:37,835
The blood found on
Kanhaiya's pillow cover...

1123
01:27:37,835 --> 01:27:39,793
...matches Khempa
's blood.

1124
01:27:45,168 --> 01:27:48,460
So if this is our main evidence...

1125
01:27:49,876 --> 01:27:51,001
...don't you think we should get this

1126
01:27:51,001 --> 01:27:52,251
reconfirmed by the lab?

1127
01:27:53,626 --> 01:27:54,418
Why sir?

1128
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:58,835
Narco tests are not admissible in court

1129
01:27:58,835 --> 01:28:00,043
and I want to be
doubly sure about this.

1130
01:28:01,710 --> 01:28:04,585
Vedant, take the first flight
to Ahmedabad,

1131
01:28:04,585 --> 01:28:06,335
and submit the reconfirmation

1132
01:28:06,335 --> 01:28:07,335
of the report by evening.

1133
01:28:07,668 --> 01:28:08,543
You understand?

1134
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:15,418
Ashwin...

1135
01:28:16,293 --> 01:28:16,668
Yes Sir...

1136
01:28:17,251 --> 01:28:19,210
You can file the chargesheet
day after tomorrow.

1137
01:28:19,668 --> 01:28:20,585
- Happy? -
Thank you Sir.

1138
01:28:24,293 --> 01:28:25,335
Sir...

1139
01:28:25,960 --> 01:28:27,543
Sir... tomorrow is my
fiancee's birthday...

1140
01:28:27,543 --> 01:28:28,543
Take her with you.

1141
01:28:29,126 --> 01:28:30,001
Sir tomorrow we...

1142
01:28:30,501 --> 01:28:32,376
When is your promotion due?

1143
01:28:33,168 --> 01:28:33,918
Still time for that...

1144
01:28:35,293 --> 01:28:37,251
There's never enough time, Vedant.

1145
01:28:37,251 --> 01:28:37,835
All the best!

1146
01:28:43,418 --> 01:28:45,793
On the recommendation of
Central Department of Investigation

1147
01:28:47,418 --> 01:28:50,501
this court grants bail
to Dr. Ramesh Tandon

1148
01:28:50,501 --> 01:28:51,918
with the following
terms and conditions:

1149
01:28:53,460 --> 01:28:55,835
The applicant is to furnish
a bond of Rs. 5 lakhs

1150
01:28:57,001 --> 01:28:58,668
and securities of a similar amount.

1151
01:29:02,918 --> 01:29:03,835
Yes Sir...

1152
01:29:05,168 --> 01:29:06,085
Ashwin listen to this...

1153
01:29:07,376 --> 01:29:08,376
Yes Vedant, carry on...

1154
01:29:08,376 --> 01:29:09,793
Sir I don't know how these idiots

1155
01:29:09,793 --> 01:29:11,043
could make such a huge mistake!

1156
01:29:11,335 --> 01:29:13,001
- They say there's some
typographical error... -

1157
01:29:13,918 --> 01:29:14,835
What typographical error?

1158
01:29:15,376 --> 01:29:16,335
Forensics collected pillow covers

1159
01:29:16,751 --> 01:29:19,376
from Khempal and Kanhaiya's rooms.

1160
01:29:19,376 --> 01:29:19,918
- Right? .

1161
01:29:20,335 --> 01:29:20,710
Right...

1162
01:29:21,168 --> 01:29:23,418
They named Khempa
's cover as Z-25

1163
01:29:23,751 --> 01:29:25,876
...and Kanhaiya's as X-52.

1164
01:29:26,251 --> 01:29:27,710
Now they're saying

1165
01:29:27,710 --> 01:29:29,418
they've typed 2-25 as X-52

1166
01:29:29,418 --> 01:29:30,293
in the report by mistake.

1167
01:29:30,668 --> 01:29:31,668
It's a typographical error.

1168
01:29:32,251 --> 01:29:33,418
Which now means that

1169
01:29:33,418 --> 01:29:34,585
the pillow cover with Khempa
's blood

1170
01:29:34,585 --> 01:29:35,876
was found in Khempa
‘s room

1171
01:29:35,876 --> 01:29:37,251
and not Kanhaiya's?

1172
01:29:37,251 --> 01:29:37,626
ls that it?

1173
01:29:37,793 --> 01:29:39,001
That's exactly what they're saying Sir!

1174
01:29:39,251 --> 01:29:40,001
How can they say that?

1175
01:29:40,168 --> 01:29:42,585
I collected the bloodied
pillow cover myself

1176
01:29:42,585 --> 01:29:43,710
from Kanhaiya's room!

1177
01:29:43,710 --> 01:29:44,585
How's that possible?

1178
01:29:45,168 --> 01:29:46,168
And how can anyone

1179
01:29:46,168 --> 01:29:48,001
mistakenly type Z-25 as X-52

1180
01:29:48,001 --> 01:29:49,126
ten different times
in the same report?

1181
01:29:49,585 --> 01:29:51,001
I've been trying to tell them

1182
01:29:51,001 --> 01:29:53,210
the same thing for hours.

1183
01:29:53,210 --> 01:29:54,210
But they are adamant!

1184
01:29:54,501 --> 01:29:55,335
Who's in charge there?

1185
01:29:55,501 --> 01:29:56,168
Put me through to him...

1186
01:29:56,335 --> 01:29:57,168
I'll kill that b******!

1187
01:29:57,710 --> 01:29:59,501
I will handle this officially don't worry.

1188
01:29:59,918 --> 01:30:00,793
No no Sir... Let me...

1189
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:02,626
Vedant, scan and mail me
those reports immediately!

1190
01:30:03,085 --> 01:30:03,710
Hello... Listen...

1191
01:30:04,210 --> 01:30:05,668
I will go myself... to Ahmedabad.

1192
01:30:05,668 --> 01:30:07,085
No no... you don't have to go...

1193
01:30:07,085 --> 01:30:07,793
I will handle it...

1194
01:30:07,960 --> 01:30:08,793
And trust me...

1195
01:30:11,418 --> 01:30:12,626
But how is that possible?

1196
01:30:21,793 --> 01:30:24,085
Are the Momos done?
- Yes

1197
01:30:24,543 --> 01:30:26,085
Turn off the gas.

1198
01:30:28,293 --> 01:30:30,876
Bhabhakaun... Hey Bhabhakaun!

1199
01:30:31,876 --> 01:30:32,960
Bhabhakaun!

1200
01:30:33,793 --> 01:30:34,876
Bhabhakaun!

1201
01:30:36,210 --> 01:30:38,126
Where has this Bhabhakaun gone?

1202
01:30:38,126 --> 01:30:40,376
What did you just say?
What is this Bhabhakaun?

1203
01:30:40,376 --> 01:30:43,626
In Nepalese, stutterers
are called Bhabhakaun.

1204
01:30:43,626 --> 01:30:44,710
Where is Bhabhakaun?

1205
01:30:44,710 --> 01:30:45,626
- Here he is. -

1206
01:30:45,876 --> 01:30:46,626
- Where were you? -

1207
01:30:47,293 --> 01:30:48,460
I had g.. gone to the b.. bathroom.

1208
01:31:01,085 --> 01:31:02,001
Who is it?

1209
01:31:12,126 --> 01:31:13,001
What were you doing?

1210
01:31:15,335 --> 01:31:17,876
S..s...sleeping...

1211
01:31:18,751 --> 01:31:21,001
Bhak.. bhak.. bhakaun?

1212
01:31:59,668 --> 01:32:01,043
Why did <i>I</i> hit you?

1213
01:32:05,001 --> 01:32:05,876
I... I don't know...

1214
01:32:06,168 --> 01:32:08,960
You'll speak the truth, yes?

1215
01:32:10,501 --> 01:32:12,085
Yes Sir...

1216
01:32:13,251 --> 01:32:14,335
The truth...

1217
01:32:14,751 --> 01:32:15,626
Yes...

1218
01:32:16,210 --> 01:32:18,335
You'll testify in court?

1219
01:32:22,501 --> 01:32:24,460
Will they hang me?

1220
01:32:26,293 --> 01:32:27,251
No, they will probably let you go...

1221
01:32:28,168 --> 01:32:29,460
...if you tell them the truth.

1222
01:32:30,710 --> 01:32:31,251
Alright?

1223
01:32:32,793 --> 01:32:34,501
Y.. yes Sir...

1224
01:32:36,210 --> 01:32:37,293
Shoot him!

1225
01:32:38,418 --> 01:32:42,001
No.. no Sir please don't shoot me!

1226
01:32:45,210 --> 01:32:48,668
We'll shoot you with a camera, is that okay?

1227
01:32:52,793 --> 01:32:54,543
Y.. yes sir...

1228
01:32:59,793 --> 01:33:00,668
Sir...

1229
01:33:03,710 --> 01:33:10,668
I... I slept early that night...

1230
01:33:15,168 --> 01:33:16,710
Khempal came to wake me up...

1231
01:33:17,085 --> 01:33:19,251
Nandu wake up! Wake up!

1232
01:33:21,835 --> 01:33:23,001
What the hell have you guys done?

1233
01:33:24,001 --> 01:33:25,918
Nothing's happened!

1234
01:33:25,918 --> 01:33:27,626
Don't worry... look!

1235
01:33:30,418 --> 01:33:31,335
She's breathing...

1236
01:33:31,793 --> 01:33:33,043
she's still breathing...

1237
01:33:34,751 --> 01:33:36,751
She's just unconscious...

1238
01:33:37,960 --> 01:33:39,543
Listen to me!

1239
01:33:39,918 --> 01:33:42,418
When I reached there...

1240
01:33:43,501 --> 01:33:44,835
Bhakbhakaun!

1241
01:33:45,293 --> 01:33:51,001
By.. by then they had killed Sh... Shruti...

1242
01:33:52,626 --> 01:33:53,501
- They who? -

1243
01:33:58,418 --> 01:34:00,585
K..k.. Kanhaiya and Rajpal.

1244
01:34:01,835 --> 01:34:03,835
You'll testify in court of your own will?

1245
01:34:09,501 --> 01:34:10,418
Yes Sir...

1246
01:34:15,585 --> 01:34:16,918
You think I'm a fool?

1247
01:34:18,001 --> 01:34:18,876
What? Sorry?

1248
01:34:20,001 --> 01:34:21,543
First you beat up
and torture somebody,

1249
01:34:21,543 --> 01:34:23,126
then force him to
become an approver?!

1250
01:34:23,418 --> 01:34:25,001
Sir he's ready to testify in
the magistrate's presence!

1251
01:34:25,001 --> 01:34:26,501
Then we chargesheet
and the case is over!

1252
01:34:26,501 --> 01:34:28,251
I don't know how Rama
used to run things...

1253
01:34:28,585 --> 01:34:29,793
...but this will not
happen in my command!

1254
01:34:30,126 --> 01:34:31,626
Sir he's willing to testify on his own!

1255
01:34:31,626 --> 01:34:33,043
You guys have turned this into a joke!

1256
01:34:34,293 --> 01:34:36,876
With great difficulty this agency
has built a reputation!

1257
01:34:36,876 --> 01:34:37,960
I won't let it go to dogs!

1258
01:34:39,585 --> 01:34:40,751
I will not tolerate this anymore!

1259
01:34:40,751 --> 01:34:41,543
Look at this!

1260
01:34:43,876 --> 01:34:45,168
- Look at this!
What is this?

1261
01:34:45,168 --> 01:34:46,251
Look at it!

1262
01:34:55,501 --> 01:34:57,668
You're off this case with immediate effect!

1263
01:34:57,960 --> 01:34:58,460
Sir...

1264
01:34:59,001 --> 01:34:59,668
Enough!

1265
01:34:59,835 --> 01:35:00,710
I don't want any more words.

1266
01:35:00,710 --> 01:35:01,126
This is..

1267
01:35:01,376 --> 01:35:02,126
Finished!

1268
01:35:05,585 --> 01:35:06,626
Traitor!

1269
01:35:08,376 --> 01:35:09,251
Ashwin!

1270
01:35:13,543 --> 01:35:15,043
You can't do this Ashwin!

1271
01:35:15,043 --> 01:35:16,543
Vinod! Come in!

1272
01:35:19,835 --> 01:35:21,543
Take him away!

1273
01:35:23,876 --> 01:35:24,835
Take this psycho away!

1274
01:35:25,668 --> 01:35:29,043
This is wrong!
- Get out!

1275
01:35:30,543 --> 01:35:31,876
You're suspended! Get out!

1276
01:36:29,751 --> 01:36:30,751
Who is it Vaishali?

1277
01:36:53,376 --> 01:36:55,460
I can't do it...

1278
01:36:56,293 --> 01:36:57,168
What?

1279
01:36:58,543 --> 01:37:00,085
I can't do it anymore...

1280
01:37:03,668 --> 01:37:04,668
Do what?

1281
01:37:05,376 --> 01:37:06,876
I just can't.

1282
01:37:14,210 --> 01:37:16,793
Please don't let me go...

1283
01:37:17,460 --> 01:37:18,335
Please...

1284
01:37:18,585 --> 01:37:19,460
- Where? -

1285
01:37:20,710 --> 01:37:22,126
I can't go back to my job!

1286
01:37:37,293 --> 01:37:40,793
The CDI has failed to file
a chargesheet within 90 days.

1287
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:43,085
And the court has released the accused

1288
01:37:43,085 --> 01:37:45,460
in the Shruti murder case, on bail.

1289
01:37:45,751 --> 01:37:48,168
Sources say the CDI will now start

1290
01:37:48,168 --> 01:37:50,460
a new investigation with a new team.

1291
01:37:59,585 --> 01:38:03,210
I'm sure all of you have
heard a lot of stories

1292
01:38:03,210 --> 01:38:05,210
about the Shruti murder case

1293
01:38:05,210 --> 01:38:06,126
as well as Ashwin Kumar.

1294
01:38:07,085 --> 01:38:11,835
So it's important that
all doubts be cleared.

1295
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:19,668
I think... he got too emotionally
involved with the case.

1296
01:38:20,501 --> 01:38:22,876
The way doctors remain

1297
01:38:22,876 --> 01:38:25,418
emotionally detached from their patients...

1298
01:38:26,043 --> 01:38:29,918
We too, need to keep
some emotional distance

1299
01:38:29,918 --> 01:38:33,835
from our cases and subjects.

1300
01:38:35,043 --> 01:38:35,960
So I request all of you...

1301
01:38:37,085 --> 01:38:41,543
please... do not, like Ashwin

1302
01:38:41,960 --> 01:38:43,335
...let your personal lives

1303
01:38:43,335 --> 01:38:45,668
get in the way
of your investigation.

1304
01:38:46,960 --> 01:38:47,835
Any questions?

1305
01:38:49,876 --> 01:38:52,001
Good, so let's get
back to work gentlemen.

1306
01:38:52,626 --> 01:38:53,460
Thank you.

1307
01:38:55,501 --> 01:38:56,960
Sir, a small request
- Yes?

1308
01:38:58,501 --> 01:39:00,793
Could we assign an
investigative officer to the case?

1309
01:39:01,085 --> 01:39:01,418
Why?

1310
01:39:02,543 --> 01:39:04,126
Sir, I've been involved with the case

1311
01:39:04,293 --> 01:39:05,501
along with Ashwin from the beginning...

1312
01:39:06,293 --> 01:39:07,210
No matter how hard I try...

1313
01:39:07,835 --> 01:39:09,751
I won't get an objective
perspective on the case...

1314
01:39:11,001 --> 01:39:11,751
It would be better if...

1315
01:39:12,126 --> 01:39:13,793
an investigative office works on the case...

1316
01:39:14,376 --> 01:39:15,751
...and I observe from a distance.

1317
01:39:16,710 --> 01:39:17,793
Do you have anybody in mind?

1318
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:19,960
Manohar or Bhattacharya?

1319
01:39:23,626 --> 01:39:24,751
No, they have their hands full...

1320
01:39:26,793 --> 01:39:27,418
Paul Sir?

1321
01:39:32,293 --> 01:39:33,668
How long will you hide?

1322
01:39:36,335 --> 01:39:37,835
How far will you run?

1323
01:39:39,210 --> 01:39:41,335
I've caught most wanted criminals...

1324
01:39:41,751 --> 01:39:43,126
You too cannot escape!

1325
01:39:45,751 --> 01:39:47,085
Come out, come out, wherever you are!

1326
01:39:50,126 --> 01:39:50,626
What's this?

1327
01:39:52,043 --> 01:39:52,626
He's become invisible!

1328
01:39:53,751 --> 01:39:54,251
You scoundrel!

1329
01:39:55,210 --> 01:39:55,876
Come out, rogue!

1330
01:39:57,168 --> 01:40:00,626
Give yourself up while you still can!

1331
01:40:03,085 --> 01:40:03,585
Hello? ..

1332
01:40:04,626 --> 01:40:05,293
- Good evening, Sir...-

1333
01:40:06,793 --> 01:40:08,418
Sir, I'm on leave for two months...

1334
01:40:09,668 --> 01:40:11,626
The wife has gone to her parents...

1335
01:40:12,501 --> 01:40:13,001
Yes...

1336
01:40:13,001 --> 01:40:13,585
Gotcha!

1337
01:40:16,876 --> 01:40:19,293
I'll just need a couple of days
to go through the files...

1338
01:40:19,960 --> 01:40:23,126
It's an honor that you have
considered me for this case Sir!

1339
01:40:24,501 --> 01:40:25,335
What about Kuku?

1340
01:40:27,543 --> 01:40:28,710
He'll be with me...

1341
01:40:30,293 --> 01:40:31,751
...but there's no problem Sir...

1342
01:40:33,168 --> 01:40:34,835
A kid hanging around

1343
01:40:35,001 --> 01:40:35,876
a murder investigation Mr Paul?

1344
01:40:38,001 --> 01:40:42,376
Sir, there's no one to take care
of him after school...

1345
01:40:43,251 --> 01:40:45,126
The Department can arrange
a babysitter for you...

1346
01:40:45,460 --> 01:40:47,126
No, it's not that...

1347
01:40:48,543 --> 01:40:51,335
The thing is, he is not an
easily manageable child...

1348
01:40:52,543 --> 01:40:54,126
...and actually, he is not even a child...

1349
01:40:54,501 --> 01:40:55,251
Not a child?

1350
01:40:58,293 --> 01:40:59,960
He's a demon!

1351
01:41:03,418 --> 01:41:04,168
Sir...

1352
01:41:06,001 --> 01:41:06,793
Sir, I need a demon...

1353
01:41:07,543 --> 01:41:08,460
...l mean a prosecutor...

1354
01:41:08,835 --> 01:41:10,126
...in the team from the beginning.

1355
01:41:10,835 --> 01:41:12,418
Prosecutor? Why?

1356
01:41:13,043 --> 01:41:15,001
To minutely verify all evidence

1357
01:41:15,168 --> 01:41:16,460
is very imperative.

1358
01:41:17,043 --> 01:41:17,668
Everyday.

1359
01:41:19,210 --> 01:41:21,210
Mr. Sanga! We're together again!

1360
01:41:22,293 --> 01:41:24,126
We don't want to repeat Ashwin's mistakes...

1361
01:41:25,751 --> 01:41:28,710
No matter how diligently we
investigate the case...

1362
01:41:28,918 --> 01:41:30,835
...ultimately, it is the prosecutor

1363
01:41:31,001 --> 01:41:32,085
who has to prove it
and win a conviction.

1364
01:41:33,960 --> 01:41:35,501
Evidence and conviction

1365
01:41:36,085 --> 01:41:37,168
are like mother and infant.

1366
01:41:38,876 --> 01:41:40,751
A healthy mother ensures
a healthy infant.

1367
01:41:49,293 --> 01:41:54,335
You made a statement that Rajpal
was with you till 12:30 at night?

1368
01:41:56,210 --> 01:41:58,793
Yes. I was returning from Dehradun...

1369
01:41:59,001 --> 01:42:02,043
...Mr Nathani and Rajpal
picked me up from the station.

1370
01:42:02,960 --> 01:42:04,043
I was fasting that day...

1371
01:42:04,710 --> 01:42:06,793
...so I had dinner at 12:00

1372
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:09,960
and went to bed at around 12:30 am.

1373
01:42:12,335 --> 01:42:15,918
How long does it take to reach
Dr.Tandon's house from here?

1374
01:42:18,293 --> 01:42:19,626
40 minutes at the most.

1375
01:42:21,293 --> 01:42:22,126
On foot?

1376
01:42:22,751 --> 01:42:23,585
Yes.

1377
01:42:24,751 --> 01:42:25,585
And by cycle?

1378
01:42:27,960 --> 01:42:28,835
20 minutes.

1379
01:42:30,168 --> 01:42:31,001
Okay-

1380
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:34,168
I'm telling the truth Sir...

1381
01:42:34,793 --> 01:42:38,043
...that day Kanhaiya came
straight home from work.

1382
01:42:38,918 --> 01:42:41,626
Six of us sleep here...

1383
01:42:41,793 --> 01:42:44,626
so if he had gone out
and come in,

1384
01:42:44,793 --> 01:42:46,668
someone would have woken up.

1385
01:42:48,001 --> 01:42:48,835
Okay-

1386
01:42:50,668 --> 01:42:52,501
Are you for real?

1387
01:42:53,043 --> 01:42:56,585
I saw alcohol bottles
in Khempa
's room.

1388
01:42:57,626 --> 01:42:58,585
And the cot was depressed?

1389
01:42:59,043 --> 01:43:00,126
Yes.

1390
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:02,376
And you?
- What?

1391
01:43:03,293 --> 01:43:05,043
How much pressure did you face?

1392
01:43:06,543 --> 01:43:09,376
2 lakhs? 5 lakhs?

1393
01:43:09,835 --> 01:43:10,668
Kanhaiya!

1394
01:43:11,376 --> 01:43:12,043
Kanhaiya!

1395
01:43:12,543 --> 01:43:16,918
Did you kill her with a Khukri?

1396
01:43:18,293 --> 01:43:20,376
Was he saying this or
were you making him say it?

1397
01:43:21,043 --> 01:43:24,168
Mind your tongue Mr.Paul!

1398
01:43:24,460 --> 01:43:27,126
You're talking to a
retired police officer!

1399
01:43:27,710 --> 01:43:30,210
When we get a lead we have to prod...

1400
01:43:30,376 --> 01:43:31,585
There's nothing wrong in this!

1401
01:43:32,710 --> 01:43:34,543
It's not wrong, it's completely wrong!

1402
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:35,835
And unethical!

1403
01:43:36,293 --> 01:43:39,126
Need permission to conduct
Narco test on the parents Sir.

1404
01:43:42,293 --> 01:43:44,043
Ramesh, did you enter
Shruti's room at night?

1405
01:43:45,043 --> 01:43:47,835
Did you tidy up the
sheets after the murder?

1406
01:43:48,460 --> 01:43:50,126
How did you kill Shruti, Ramesh?

1407
01:43:51,043 --> 01:43:52,876
Did you clean the room afterwards?

1408
01:43:53,293 --> 01:43:58,126
Sources say the CDI
has been left red-faced.

1409
01:43:58,751 --> 01:44:00,918
As per the Narco tests

1410
01:44:01,293 --> 01:44:02,751
the CDI has found no evidence

1411
01:44:03,043 --> 01:44:05,626
that connects the Tandons
to Shruti‘s murder.

1412
01:44:06,543 --> 01:44:09,835
Both the husband and wife
are clever scoundrels!

1413
01:44:10,543 --> 01:44:12,751
They must've taken some
antidote before the Narco tests...

1414
01:44:13,793 --> 01:44:16,335
No wonder the Narco drugs
didn't work on them.

1415
01:44:19,501 --> 01:44:20,668
Are there antidotes
for Narco tests?

1416
01:44:21,668 --> 01:44:23,960
There aren't. But there could be...

1417
01:44:25,126 --> 01:44:27,543
Don't forget... they're both Doctors!

1418
01:44:29,460 --> 01:44:31,126
The ones testing them
are also Doctors, Mr Paul...

1419
01:44:31,918 --> 01:44:33,085
I'm sure they were put through

1420
01:44:33,251 --> 01:44:35,126
blood tests before the Narco.

1421
01:44:36,918 --> 01:44:37,960
It could also be possible that

1422
01:44:38,126 --> 01:44:39,710
they didn't commit the murders after all?

1423
01:44:42,668 --> 01:44:45,501
Look at their faces... their eyes...

1424
01:44:45,668 --> 01:44:47,543
Don't they look like murderers?

1425
01:45:09,918 --> 01:45:12,126
But there are two of them in the photo.

1426
01:45:13,293 --> 01:45:14,793
It's been one and a half years...

1427
01:45:17,418 --> 01:45:18,335
I have no idea where it could be.

1428
01:45:20,126 --> 01:45:23,168
The girl's forehead wound
is 4x3 centimeters.

1429
01:45:25,126 --> 01:45:27,126
And how big is this?

1430
01:45:33,710 --> 01:45:35,001
Khempal was hit on the back of the head...

1431
01:45:35,501 --> 01:45:36,543
...and the girl on the forehead?

1432
01:45:41,876 --> 01:45:43,001
God is great!

1433
01:45:44,626 --> 01:45:46,418
And holy are the
messengers of his faith!

1434
01:45:49,126 --> 01:45:49,960
Missionary.

1435
01:45:50,918 --> 01:45:52,376
What the hell are you making me do?

1436
01:46:52,376 --> 01:46:55,543
You are bargaining like
you're out to buy vegetables...

1437
01:46:55,710 --> 01:46:56,793
- No Gogia Sir... Nothing like that. -

1438
01:46:56,960 --> 01:46:58,585
This is not how bussiness is done...

1439
01:46:58,751 --> 01:47:00,585
- Please see what you can do.
This will be very difficult for me.-

1440
01:47:00,751 --> 01:47:02,835
This is what it is... Now you decide.

1441
01:47:32,001 --> 01:47:33,168
Thank you.

1442
01:47:55,710 --> 01:47:56,835
In some cases...

1443
01:47:57,418 --> 01:48:01,251
the process of intelligence gathering
has to trample law...

1444
01:48:03,043 --> 01:48:06,168
...in order to achieve effective results.

1445
01:48:07,793 --> 01:48:11,626
That's why some experts
define information gathering...

1446
01:48:12,835 --> 01:48:15,210
...as a legal act carried out illegally.

1447
01:48:21,043 --> 01:48:22,293
Somewhere we have to
find a balance between...

1448
01:48:25,293 --> 01:48:26,751
...what the system wants you to do...

1449
01:48:28,751 --> 01:48:31,501
...and what you feel is
right as an individual.

1450
01:48:36,626 --> 01:48:37,168
Thank you.

1451
01:48:43,251 --> 01:48:45,210
Time for the Q and A.

1452
01:48:45,376 --> 01:48:47,876
If anyone has any questions
for Mr Kumar please proceed.

1453
01:48:49,585 --> 01:48:50,418
Yeah, Sandeep...

1454
01:48:52,460 --> 01:48:53,335
Sir, I was wondering...

1455
01:48:54,251 --> 01:48:56,918
...since you're such an accomplished
officer of your agency...

1456
01:48:57,460 --> 01:48:59,418
Why did you take premature retirement?

1457
01:49:01,001 --> 01:49:01,793
What made you quit?

1458
01:49:04,043 --> 01:49:05,418
I guess I couldn't find the balance.

1459
01:49:08,376 --> 01:49:10,001
Call me if any one
of you guys find it.

1460
01:49:11,126 --> 01:49:11,501
Please...

1461
01:49:12,668 --> 01:49:14,001
- Thank you Sir.-

1462
01:49:19,710 --> 01:49:21,251
Sir, are you sure
you dialed the right number?

1463
01:49:23,418 --> 01:49:24,376
Ashwin, how are you?

1464
01:49:25,043 --> 01:49:25,501
All well...

1465
01:49:27,043 --> 01:49:30,001
The meeting I spoke to you about earlier...
- Yes... -

1466
01:49:30,168 --> 01:49:31,585
It's at 11 :00 am tomorrow.

1467
01:49:34,626 --> 01:49:39,043
Many of your fans will be present...

1468
01:49:40,793 --> 01:49:42,293
- Alright?
- Okay,

1469
01:49:46,043 --> 01:49:48,835
I've read the reports
from both teams, in detail...

1470
01:49:49,835 --> 01:49:52,126
Both the conclusions are as different

1471
01:49:52,126 --> 01:49:53,835
as warring political parties!

1472
01:49:56,418 --> 01:49:58,835
One team says the
servants are the killers,

1473
01:49:58,835 --> 01:50:01,293
and the other says the parents did it.

1474
01:50:01,835 --> 01:50:03,710
Now the ministry has
to take some stand...

1475
01:50:04,543 --> 01:50:05,376
- It's high time! -

1476
01:50:05,960 --> 01:50:07,710
Either you convince each other...

1477
01:50:08,126 --> 01:50:09,001
- Or convince me.-

1478
01:50:10,376 --> 01:50:11,251
Ashwin?

1479
01:50:15,251 --> 01:50:17,168
Sir, every investigation
follows a prime rule -

1480
01:50:17,543 --> 01:50:19,126
Inquiry, evidence and conclusion...

1481
01:50:19,418 --> 01:50:20,585
You enquire for evidence

1482
01:50:21,210 --> 01:50:22,251
and you come to a conclusion.

1483
01:50:23,835 --> 01:50:25,293
Here everything has backtracked...

1484
01:50:25,793 --> 01:50:27,210
These people first decided

1485
01:50:27,210 --> 01:50:28,418
on the conclusion...

1486
01:50:28,418 --> 01:50:29,335
then dug very hard for evidence.

1487
01:50:29,876 --> 01:50:31,210
You worked hard as well Sir...

1488
01:50:34,043 --> 01:50:35,460
...to get the poor, innocent servants

1489
01:50:35,460 --> 01:50:36,585
hung to their deaths.

1490
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:38,293
If they are innocent, what are you?

1491
01:50:40,001 --> 01:50:40,876
There were four people in the house.

1492
01:50:41,668 --> 01:50:42,751
Two are alive and two dead.

1493
01:50:43,210 --> 01:50:43,793
- As simple as that. -

1494
01:50:44,376 --> 01:50:46,043
Everyone's testimony has changed!

1495
01:50:46,335 --> 01:50:48,460
The maid servant, the forensic
expert, the postmortem doctor!

1496
01:50:49,043 --> 01:50:51,085
So is it as simple as that?

1497
01:50:51,418 --> 01:50:52,293
Yes it is!

1498
01:50:52,501 --> 01:50:54,210
It happened!
- How is it possible? -

1499
01:50:54,460 --> 01:50:55,376
Guys... Please!

1500
01:50:57,001 --> 01:50:58,126
Let's do one thing...

1501
01:50:58,918 --> 01:51:00,335
The second team can present

1502
01:51:00,335 --> 01:51:02,126
whatever new crucial
evidence or testimonies

1503
01:51:02,126 --> 01:51:03,960
- they have discovered... -

1504
01:51:05,668 --> 01:51:07,335
The first team can
examine the credentials.

1505
01:51:07,793 --> 01:51:08,668
- Fair? -

1506
01:51:09,335 --> 01:51:10,168
Fair enough.

1507
01:51:10,418 --> 01:51:10,793
Mr Paul...

1508
01:51:11,418 --> 01:51:12,126
Sir...

1509
01:51:13,043 --> 01:51:14,335
The biggest issue in this case is whether

1510
01:51:15,126 --> 01:51:17,543
there was anyone else at home that night...

1511
01:51:18,418 --> 01:51:20,293
- The first team says the killer
came from outside, -

1512
01:51:20,293 --> 01:51:22,793
killed Shruti, latched the door and ran.

1513
01:51:22,793 --> 01:51:23,460
Right?

1514
01:51:26,043 --> 01:51:26,876
Wrong.

1515
01:51:30,043 --> 01:51:31,793
The first person to arrive
at the crime scene...

1516
01:51:32,335 --> 01:51:35,085
if I may call her the prime witness...

1517
01:51:37,626 --> 01:51:39,251
The maid servant, Basanti...

1518
01:51:39,751 --> 01:51:41,751
- After both the murders,
the Tandons -

1519
01:51:41,751 --> 01:51:44,126
had been waiting for her to come.

1520
01:51:44,418 --> 01:51:46,793
- Basanti came, rang the bell, -

1521
01:51:47,335 --> 01:51:48,085
- the door was closed...-

1522
01:51:48,543 --> 01:51:51,460
Then the key is thrown from the balcony...

1523
01:51:52,418 --> 01:51:55,293
I'd like you to look at this door...

1524
01:51:56,751 --> 01:51:58,501
- This door is between
the two front doors, -

1525
01:51:59,210 --> 01:52:00,918
and it opens into Khempa
‘s room.

1526
01:52:04,418 --> 01:52:06,668
Normally, there is a fridge
placed against this door...

1527
01:52:07,418 --> 01:52:08,585
But that morning

1528
01:52:08,585 --> 01:52:10,335
the Tandons had moved the fridge

1529
01:52:10,335 --> 01:52:12,460
to be able to open the door.

1530
01:52:16,376 --> 01:52:19,168
When Basanti turned to the
stairs to get the key...

1531
01:52:21,168 --> 01:52:23,001
Mrs Tandon came out
of this very door,

1532
01:52:23,001 --> 01:52:25,001
opened the main door,

1533
01:52:25,626 --> 01:52:27,293
- and went back to throw the key. -

1534
01:52:27,835 --> 01:52:30,293
When Basanti came back up,

1535
01:52:30,293 --> 01:52:31,751
the main door didn't need a key...

1536
01:52:31,751 --> 01:52:32,585
...it opened with just a push.

1537
01:52:33,376 --> 01:52:35,668
The front door was
latched from outside,

1538
01:52:35,668 --> 01:52:37,460
just to show that
someone had broken in,

1539
01:52:37,460 --> 01:52:38,710
killed and run away...

1540
01:52:39,501 --> 01:52:41,710
What followed was the
Tandons acting all shocked...

1541
01:52:42,835 --> 01:52:44,918
When Basanti first came,
did she push

1542
01:52:44,918 --> 01:52:46,418
the main door to check
if it was unlocked?

1543
01:52:47,418 --> 01:52:48,293
Yes she did.

1544
01:52:48,835 --> 01:52:50,501
Her statement doesn't say so.

1545
01:52:51,168 --> 01:52:53,043
No problem, we can take
her statement again.

1546
01:52:53,668 --> 01:52:54,585
By blackmailing her like Gogia?

1547
01:52:55,293 --> 01:52:56,918
Oh come on Ashwin!

1548
01:52:57,835 --> 01:53:00,376
We don't torture people
to make them approvers...

1549
01:53:01,251 --> 01:53:03,126
Sir, do you understand what
these people are trying to say?

1550
01:53:05,293 --> 01:53:06,168
Just imagine...

1551
01:53:07,293 --> 01:53:09,501
...I'll throw you the keys.

1552
01:53:11,168 --> 01:53:12,793
The moment Basanti
turns to get the key,

1553
01:53:14,210 --> 01:53:16,001
Nutan runs inside

1554
01:53:16,001 --> 01:53:17,960
and does everything that they are saying...

1555
01:53:34,043 --> 01:53:35,960
Put this back, I'll throw her the keys...

1556
01:53:59,418 --> 01:54:01,501
Quick, let's go! We have
to start crying now...

1557
01:54:36,376 --> 01:54:39,668
Look what, Khempal has done.

1558
01:54:44,043 --> 01:54:45,710
Such intricate planning!

1559
01:54:46,626 --> 01:54:48,585
Two murders, one dead
body on the terrace...

1560
01:54:49,418 --> 01:54:50,793
...dressing up the crime scene...

1561
01:54:51,626 --> 01:54:54,418
Moving the fridge, opening the
small door, latching the front door...

1562
01:54:54,668 --> 01:54:56,460
...throwing keys, moving
the fridge again...

1563
01:54:57,793 --> 01:54:58,376
All in a flash!

1564
01:54:59,168 --> 01:55:00,293
Are they Spiderman and Superwoman?

1565
01:55:00,751 --> 01:55:01,751
What are they?

1566
01:55:06,335 --> 01:55:07,668
And after all that planning,

1567
01:55:07,668 --> 01:55:11,501
the blood-stained whiskey
bottle on the table...

1568
01:55:12,043 --> 01:55:12,960
...they didn't clear that up?

1569
01:55:14,418 --> 01:55:15,168
How come?

1570
01:55:15,418 --> 01:55:17,043
Because they weren't professional killers.

1571
01:55:17,418 --> 01:55:19,043
Sir, it's simple...

1572
01:55:19,418 --> 01:55:22,501
...if a father sees his
daughter's dead body...

1573
01:55:23,251 --> 01:55:25,751
...will he cry standing outside
the room or run to hug her?

1574
01:55:26,043 --> 01:55:26,793
Has your daughter died?

1575
01:55:26,960 --> 01:55:28,126
Do you know what it
feels like to lose a child?

1576
01:55:28,835 --> 01:55:29,710
And you do?

1577
01:55:31,585 --> 01:55:33,043
To have a daughter,

1578
01:55:33,043 --> 01:55:35,418
you first need a wife...

1579
01:55:36,585 --> 01:55:37,710
You don't even have that.

1580
01:55:39,710 --> 01:55:41,918
We're talking about a
human reaction here...

1581
01:55:42,251 --> 01:55:43,543
That's exactly the point!

1582
01:55:44,251 --> 01:55:46,043
Human reactions can be different...

1583
01:55:46,501 --> 01:55:48,043
How can we generalize this?

1584
01:55:48,793 --> 01:55:49,918
Sir, please note...

1585
01:55:52,251 --> 01:55:55,210
Khempa
's throat was slit completely...

1586
01:55:55,418 --> 01:55:56,960
...in a full circle.

1587
01:55:59,210 --> 01:56:00,585
The girl's was only half slit.

1588
01:56:02,043 --> 01:56:02,501
SQ?

1589
01:56:04,543 --> 01:56:06,210
Human reaction. She was their daughter...

1590
01:56:07,751 --> 01:56:09,085
Emotional attachment...

1591
01:56:11,251 --> 01:56:14,251
So while murdering his child
the doctor said...

1592
01:56:16,251 --> 01:56:19,293
'Sorry dear, I'm slitting your throat...'

1593
01:56:20,001 --> 01:56:21,335
'Hope you're not in pain?'

1594
01:56:22,043 --> 01:56:24,210
'Almost done...'

1595
01:56:24,668 --> 01:56:26,501
'Just this one vein and you'll die!'

1596
01:56:27,960 --> 01:56:28,918
Let's be serious guys...

1597
01:56:34,418 --> 01:56:37,376
Sorry... but you're right,
their whole theory is a joke.

1598
01:56:37,960 --> 01:56:39,585
The internet router switched on and off

1599
01:56:39,585 --> 01:56:41,001
three times that night...

1600
01:56:42,043 --> 01:56:43,251
That means the parents were awake.

1601
01:56:43,876 --> 01:56:45,543
Next day when all hell broke loose,

1602
01:56:45,543 --> 01:56:46,918
and no one used the computer...

1603
01:56:46,918 --> 01:56:48,251
...even then the router
switched on and off...

1604
01:56:49,460 --> 01:56:50,501
The router is made in India.

1605
01:56:50,501 --> 01:56:52,043
It turns on and off at its own will!

1606
01:56:52,418 --> 01:56:53,793
The computer was
actually used that day...

1607
01:56:54,043 --> 01:56:54,543
What for?

1608
01:56:54,960 --> 01:56:56,001
Shruti's friends used it...

1609
01:56:56,626 --> 01:56:57,335
Why?

1610
01:57:00,793 --> 01:57:02,626
To clean up disreputable literature...

1611
01:57:02,876 --> 01:57:03,543
What?

1612
01:57:04,751 --> 01:57:06,085
Porn... Pornographic material...

1613
01:57:06,085 --> 01:57:06,793
- You don't know? -

1614
01:57:07,835 --> 01:57:09,293
Okay... Testimony?

1615
01:57:09,626 --> 01:57:10,918
Off the record.

1616
01:57:10,918 --> 01:57:11,460
Why?

1617
01:57:11,835 --> 01:57:14,293
What would people say about the girl?

1618
01:57:16,418 --> 01:57:17,543
Oh... Compassion!

1619
01:57:18,418 --> 01:57:22,710
So Mr Compassionate, what
was the motive for the murder?

1620
01:57:23,168 --> 01:57:24,293
Sudden rage.

1621
01:57:25,335 --> 01:57:26,210
Why?

1622
01:57:26,376 --> 01:57:27,918
The doctor found his
daughter and his servant

1623
01:57:27,918 --> 01:57:30,126
in a Sacrilegious Disposition.

1624
01:57:30,418 --> 01:57:32,918
Then he lost his self control and...

1625
01:57:33,418 --> 01:57:34,710
Sacrilegious Disposition?

1626
01:57:35,418 --> 01:57:37,293
Missionary position.

1627
01:57:38,710 --> 01:57:40,126
- He then took the golf club and...-

1628
01:57:40,626 --> 01:57:43,251
first the servant, then the daughter...

1629
01:57:47,043 --> 01:57:48,335
The golf club was in the girl's room?

1630
01:57:48,710 --> 01:57:50,918
No, in the servant's room...

1631
01:57:53,710 --> 01:57:56,210
So the doctor found them in a sacre...

1632
01:57:56,210 --> 01:57:57,626
...sacremonious?

1633
01:57:57,626 --> 01:57:58,460
Sacrilegious disposition?

1634
01:57:58,626 --> 01:57:59,918
Yes... in that disposition...

1635
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:02,918
And he ran out of the room
to fetch his golf club...

1636
01:58:03,793 --> 01:58:06,293
And by the time he came back,
the servant and the girl...

1637
01:58:06,835 --> 01:58:08,418
...were still in the same position?

1638
01:58:08,835 --> 01:58:09,918
Sacrilegious disposition...

1639
01:58:11,168 --> 01:58:13,168
Sir, be serious!
We are doing serious business...

1640
01:58:14,335 --> 01:58:15,418
Can we go on please?

1641
01:58:16,085 --> 01:58:17,585
He wants to memorize this word!

1642
01:58:17,835 --> 01:58:19,085
Sir, let's carry on please...

1643
01:58:19,085 --> 01:58:20,293
Carry on guys--

1644
01:58:21,418 --> 01:58:22,293
Sacrilegious.

1645
01:58:23,043 --> 01:58:23,918
Paul Sir...

1646
01:58:25,043 --> 01:58:28,085
According to you, the girl's computer

1647
01:58:28,085 --> 01:58:29,293
was full of disreputable literature...

1648
01:58:30,418 --> 01:58:32,793
Porn.
- Yeah, now you know...

1649
01:58:34,043 --> 01:58:35,210
It was full of disreputable literature...

1650
01:58:35,460 --> 01:58:35,793
Yes

1651
01:58:37,543 --> 01:58:38,335
And she had a boyfriend too...

1652
01:58:39,751 --> 01:58:41,168
Then why would she need to be in a

1653
01:58:41,168 --> 01:58:42,668
Sacrilegious Disposition with a
50 year old servant?

1654
01:58:43,251 --> 01:58:45,335
Not a need, but a revenge
against her parents...

1655
01:58:45,751 --> 01:58:46,626
Revenge for what?

1656
01:58:47,543 --> 01:58:50,126
She was aware of her parents activities...

1657
01:58:50,876 --> 01:58:51,960
What activities?

1658
01:58:53,210 --> 01:58:54,251
Wife swapping-

1659
01:58:55,418 --> 01:58:56,918
That was the only way she could retaliate

1660
01:58:56,918 --> 01:58:58,043
and hurt them

1661
01:58:58,043 --> 01:58:59,293
and have sex with the servant.

1662
01:59:01,043 --> 01:59:04,085
This was the angle used by
the first police investigation...

1663
01:59:04,376 --> 01:59:07,085
And the Chief...

1664
01:59:07,085 --> 01:59:09,543
who embarrassed the whole police department

1665
01:59:09,543 --> 01:59:11,710
in that press conference...

1666
01:59:12,418 --> 01:59:15,293
He was your batch-mate, right?

1667
01:59:15,835 --> 01:59:16,710
What do you mean?

1668
01:59:17,043 --> 01:59:17,710
Nothing...

1669
01:59:17,710 --> 01:59:18,376
Then why do you say it?

1670
01:59:19,085 --> 01:59:21,835
'The heart is familiar
with the world's ways...'

1671
01:59:21,835 --> 01:59:24,293
'True friends are always
handy to save face...'

1672
01:59:26,418 --> 01:59:28,501
Learn to lose gracefully at least...

1673
01:59:29,251 --> 01:59:30,126
Ashwin, come on!

1674
01:59:32,085 --> 01:59:34,293
When Khempa
's body was
found on the terrace...

1675
01:59:34,835 --> 01:59:36,710
...he was wearing his slippers.

1676
01:59:37,251 --> 01:59:39,710
So was he wearing his slippers

1677
01:59:39,710 --> 01:59:41,710
while in the Sacrilegious Disposition?

1678
01:59:46,418 --> 01:59:49,293
Or he was like 'Oh Doctor...
you caught me but don't kill me here...

1679
01:59:49,835 --> 01:59:52,293
...let's go to the terrace...
I'll just get my slippers...'

1680
01:59:54,043 --> 01:59:54,918
Anyway, Sir...

1681
01:59:56,251 --> 02:00:00,460
Rajpa
's house is 20 minutes
away from the Tandon's house...

1682
02:00:01,001 --> 02:00:03,918
Not a single watchman saw
him entering or exiting the building.

1683
02:00:04,751 --> 02:00:08,126
Even if we accept your theory...

1684
02:00:08,668 --> 02:00:11,376
at 12:30 am, he was at Nathani's house...

1685
02:00:13,418 --> 02:00:14,293
We have the testimony.

1686
02:00:15,418 --> 02:00:19,626
That means he reached the
Tandon house at 12:50 am.

1687
02:00:20,293 --> 02:00:21,835
As per the postmortem,

1688
02:00:22,460 --> 02:00:24,376
the murder happened
between 12 and 1 at night...

1689
02:00:25,585 --> 02:00:28,251
The same doctor has given

1690
02:00:28,251 --> 02:00:29,751
the time of murder as 12 noon.

1691
02:00:29,751 --> 02:00:31,460
He was just confused...

1692
02:00:31,460 --> 02:00:32,376
When the girl was in school...

1693
02:00:32,793 --> 02:00:35,043
- He jumbled up the AM and PM...-

1694
02:00:35,043 --> 02:00:37,126
Screw his AM and PM!

1695
02:00:38,418 --> 02:00:40,543
His reports have changed
four times in three years!

1696
02:00:41,543 --> 02:00:45,210
Either the vaginal
swab is contaminated,

1697
02:00:45,210 --> 02:00:47,251
- or the finding is 'subjective'... -

1698
02:00:47,543 --> 02:00:49,168
First they said the Khukri killed her,

1699
02:00:49,168 --> 02:00:50,710
now they say it's a surgical instrument.

1700
02:00:51,501 --> 02:00:53,043
In the Narco tests the servants gave

1701
02:00:53,043 --> 02:00:54,251
a detailed account of the murders...

1702
02:00:56,835 --> 02:00:58,501
You did a Narco test on the parents.

1703
02:00:58,501 --> 02:00:59,501
Did you find anything?

1704
02:01:00,418 --> 02:01:02,918
The first team's Narco report is fabricated...

1705
02:01:03,210 --> 02:01:06,001
These are the CDs of the original report...

1706
02:01:06,001 --> 02:01:07,043
You can have a look...

1707
02:01:09,085 --> 02:01:12,085
As per your Narco tests,

1708
02:01:12,085 --> 02:01:14,210
the murderers destroyed Khempa
's

1709
02:01:14,210 --> 02:01:16,210
and Shruti's cell phones.

1710
02:01:17,876 --> 02:01:19,793
Six months later the girl's phone

1711
02:01:19,793 --> 02:01:21,293
turned up in U.P. state.

1712
02:01:22,376 --> 02:01:23,793
My team has also recovered

1713
02:01:23,793 --> 02:01:25,418
the murder weapon - the Golf club.

1714
02:01:26,043 --> 02:01:26,918
Recovered?
- Yes

1715
02:01:27,376 --> 02:01:28,626
Mr Tandon found it in his house

1716
02:01:28,626 --> 02:01:29,543
and brought it to you himself!

1717
02:01:32,835 --> 02:01:35,293
If this master planner had used it
to murder two people,

1718
02:01:35,293 --> 02:01:37,293
wouldn't he have destroyed it?

1719
02:01:38,043 --> 02:01:40,001
These people have created

1720
02:01:40,001 --> 02:01:41,376
imaginary stories about everything!

1721
02:01:42,668 --> 02:01:44,710
Are you going to tell him
about the typographical error?

1722
02:01:46,043 --> 02:01:46,918
What is that?

1723
02:01:48,168 --> 02:01:50,043
A pillow with Khempa
's blood

1724
02:01:50,043 --> 02:01:51,251
was recovered from Kanhaiya's room...

1725
02:01:51,835 --> 02:01:53,751
That was recovered from
Khempa
's room only...

1726
02:01:54,835 --> 02:01:57,043
...the forensics made an
error while typing.

1727
02:01:57,418 --> 02:01:58,626
And you reminded them of this..

1728
02:02:01,043 --> 02:02:02,543
These guys wrote a letter
to the forensics to ask...

1729
02:02:03,335 --> 02:02:05,501
...if there are any typographical errors.

1730
02:02:06,835 --> 02:02:08,543
And it's not AN error... it's errors!

1731
02:02:10,043 --> 02:02:11,376
Twenty errors of the same word

1732
02:02:11,376 --> 02:02:12,918
on the same report!

1733
02:02:15,293 --> 02:02:16,126
Can I see those photographs?

1734
02:02:22,710 --> 02:02:24,210
These numbers have been given by you,

1735
02:02:24,210 --> 02:02:25,293
not by the forensics team.

1736
02:02:26,043 --> 02:02:26,918
So let the court decide!

1737
02:02:28,835 --> 02:02:30,835
What will court do unless we make a decision?

1738
02:02:33,835 --> 02:02:35,835
Can the case be proved in court?

1739
02:02:36,335 --> 02:02:38,918
We only have circumstantial evidence...

1740
02:02:38,918 --> 02:02:40,043
so it will be difficult.

1741
02:02:40,418 --> 02:02:41,543
To be honest...

1742
02:02:42,501 --> 02:02:44,376
No one except the parents
could have committed the murders...

1743
02:02:44,918 --> 02:02:46,251
But that they ARE the murderers,

1744
02:02:46,251 --> 02:02:48,376
this we can neither say... nor prove...

1745
02:02:49,835 --> 02:02:51,501
The case could have been proved...

1746
02:02:53,418 --> 02:02:56,793
...because one of the servants

1747
02:02:56,793 --> 02:02:58,793
was ready to become an approver...

1748
02:03:00,626 --> 02:03:01,876
But it is all past now.

1749
02:03:04,251 --> 02:03:06,668
It is better to free ten criminals,

1750
02:03:06,668 --> 02:03:07,918
than imprison one innocent...

1751
02:03:16,418 --> 02:03:19,543
There seems to be no other
option but to close the case...

1752
02:03:23,418 --> 02:03:27,293
'It's better to end a
story on a good note...

1753
02:03:28,835 --> 02:03:35,293
...in case it cannot be
brought to a logical end...'

1754
02:03:38,418 --> 02:03:41,126
File the closure report. Fairly.

1755
02:03:42,293 --> 02:03:43,335
Yes Sir.

1756
02:03:45,418 --> 02:03:48,293
Though our investigation clearly points...

1757
02:03:49,043 --> 02:03:53,168
...to the parents as Shruti's killers...

1758
02:03:54,210 --> 02:03:57,293
...the evidence collected
is not strong enough...

1759
02:03:57,835 --> 02:04:00,126
...to file a chargesheet against them.

1760
02:04:01,418 --> 02:04:05,293
The CDI therefore requests
the closure of this case.

1761
02:04:06,668 --> 02:04:08,793
I will never accept this Closure Report!

1762
02:04:08,793 --> 02:04:10,918
I'll go to the Supreme Court if I have to!

1763
02:04:12,418 --> 02:04:13,668
Murderer!

1764
02:04:18,418 --> 02:04:21,418
Get the car...

1765
02:04:23,876 --> 02:04:25,751
Your report says it would be difficult

1766
02:04:25,751 --> 02:04:29,293
to prove the parents guilty in court...

1767
02:04:30,126 --> 02:04:31,001
Difficult?

1768
02:04:32,168 --> 02:04:33,501
It's not impossible, right?

1769
02:04:35,626 --> 02:04:37,251
Your Closure Report is rubbish...

1770
02:04:37,251 --> 02:04:39,043
It won't be accepted.

1771
02:04:40,251 --> 02:04:42,043
Charge the parents with murder

1772
02:04:42,043 --> 02:04:43,626
and begin the trial.

1773
02:04:45,043 --> 02:04:45,918
ls it lunchtime yet?

1774
02:04:53,418 --> 02:04:55,501
Despite lack of solid evidence

1775
02:04:55,501 --> 02:04:57,335
the court has ordered that

1776
02:04:57,335 --> 02:05:00,793
the Tandons be tried for murder.

1777
02:05:01,251 --> 02:05:03,501
- This has shocked not just
the Tandons, -

1778
02:05:03,501 --> 02:05:05,793
- but also the CD
.-

1779
02:05:39,835 --> 02:05:41,751
The accused Dr. Ramesh Tandon

1780
02:05:41,751 --> 02:05:42,918
and Dr. Nutan Tandon

1781
02:05:44,043 --> 02:05:45,501
are convicted under sections 302

1782
02:05:46,293 --> 02:05:48,460
and section 201

1783
02:05:49,460 --> 02:05:50,626
read with section 34 IPC.

1784
02:05:51,293 --> 02:05:56,210
Dr. Ramesh Tandon is also
convicted under section 203 lPC.

1785
02:05:57,251 --> 02:06:00,960
Under section 302 IPC both the accused

1786
02:06:01,460 --> 02:06:03,085
are fined Rs.10,000/- each

1787
02:06:03,085 --> 02:06:05,585
and sentenced to rigorous
imprisonment for life.

1788
02:06:28,335 --> 02:06:29,793
No, I want to open it now!

1789
02:06:30,960 --> 02:06:31,835
Please!

1790
02:06:33,251 --> 02:06:34,126
Okay-

1791
02:06:34,418 --> 02:06:35,710
Thank you!

1792
02:06:37,043 --> 02:06:37,585
Wow!

1793
02:06:38,710 --> 02:06:39,585
- Camera! -

1794
02:06:40,626 --> 02:06:43,085
Papa say something
for my birthday quickly!

1795
02:06:45,418 --> 02:06:46,626
Happy birthday Shruti!

1796
02:07:01,501 --> 02:07:03,626
<i>when dreams slither</i>

1797
02:07:07,376 --> 02:07:10,585
<i>through the Iatticed eyelashes</i>

1798
02:07:13,418 --> 02:07:16,251
<i>of familiar eyes...</i>

1799
02:07:18,918 --> 02:07:22,335
<i>it feels like she's alive</i>

1800
02:07:25,126 --> 02:07:28,585
<i>it feels like...</i>

1801
02:07:29,668 --> 02:07:32,501
<i>...she's alive</i>
