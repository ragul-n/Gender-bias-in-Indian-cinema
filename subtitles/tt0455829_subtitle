1
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:25,722
Sir, Raghavan has become
thorn in the flesh.

2
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:28,519
He brushed aside all ourthreats.

3
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,561
What? Using him?

4
00:00:31,931 --> 00:00:34,229
l don't want to listen !
l can't wait any longer.

5
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:36,800
Who does he think he is? Narcotics?

6
00:00:38,104 --> 00:00:40,072
Why is he interfering?-You go.

7
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:46,738
He's been messing with me forthe past ten years,
even though he knows who l am.

8
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:48,405
Proud of being a policeman.- Dear?

9
00:00:48,581 --> 00:00:49,570
You go ahead. l'll come.

10
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:54,345
l don't want to hear any of that.
Listen to me. l want his eye.

11
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,351
l want DCP Raghavans left eye.

12
00:00:56,856 --> 00:00:59,222
5 lacs forthe guy brings it to me.
Spot Payment.

13
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:01,784
Announce it. Let's see who has the guts.

14
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:28,647
Hey, Raghavan is here!

15
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:48,838
Boss! Boss!

16
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:51,909
What?-Where is he?
Tell him DCP Raghavan is here.

17
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:04,319
What is it sir?

18
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:09,955
Nothing Mani. l heard you asked for my eye.
- l didn't ask for it, sir.

19
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:13,796
l heard you priced it at 5 Lacs
for whoever brings it??

20
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:17,634
Why spend unnecessarily? Here l am.

21
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:21,764
Take my eye do it that is if you're a man!

22
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:31,242
Word is that, you said l'm a big problem,

23
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:38,681
l won't listen to you even after all the warnings,
so, you want my eye .

24
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:40,884
Are you trying to say that
you are not Rayapuram Mani?

25
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:42,593
Raghavan...Don't...

26
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:48,756
lt's between you and me, an old stand off!
forthe last ten years, right?

27
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:52,297
Lets finish it now.
That's why l am here.

28
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,065
lf you let me out of here alive and
with my sight intact,

29
00:02:57,043 --> 00:03:01,639
let me tell you in front of your men,
you'll be just be plain 'Mani'.

30
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:08,178
Your smuggling, ganja, heroin,
illegal activities etc. l'll end it all.

31
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:11,448
Even deciding to retire and stay home
with yourfamily wont work

32
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:12,554
because you'll be in jail counting bars,
but then again,

33
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:15,556
you don't know any Maths
what the hell will you count?

34
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:21,697
You think l'm talking big
because of my uniform?

35
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:25,434
But l haven't come in uniform,

36
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:29,666
l am not on duty and l haven't come with back up.

37
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:33,243
l'm here all by myself. So how about it?
just you and me, man to man?

38
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:39,217
Shut the gate! Fucker! Shut the gate.

39
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:46,222
Here boss!

40
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:52,824
Good.

41
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:56,897
Stop all your nefarious activities.

42
00:03:57,837 --> 00:03:59,532
Come to the Commissioner's office tomorrow.

43
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:03,868
Come at 10.00. Don't come too early,
l'll take your statement personally.

44
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:06,707
All of you find other jobs.

45
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,049
Shut the gate.

46
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:17,554
l'm in too deep Raghavan.

47
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:21,791
l don't know how to do anything else.

48
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:26,495
You're my only problem and l don't give a fuck!

49
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:29,527
Boys! hack him to death!

Team ForCe

51
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:28,357
He is an exponent,
who suggests that you be a thief,

52
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:32,888
And the biggest of crooks
can't get past this demon!

53
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:37,292
He is a human being who
learned to stand on water

54
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:41,673
He goes everywhere like a wind...

55
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:46,004
He loved his profession

56
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:56,383
And lived for his profession
and moved around fearlessly...

57
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:08,558
He is an exponent,
who suggests that you be a thief,

58
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:12,794
And the biggest of crooks
can't get past this demon!

59
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:17,268
He is a human being who
learned to stand on water

60
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:21,713
He would act as swift as the wind...

Team ForCe

62
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:43,761
When bravery and honesty go hand in hand,

63
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:48,202
The dictionary would call it Raghavan

64
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:52,500
His character was never
demanding nor dominating.

65
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:57,077
And he resembled the tiger in his steps.

66
00:06:57,717 --> 00:07:01,847
He was the one who held high respects
for his profession

67
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:06,150
And hearing that even the sky would
want to shake hands with him

68
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:11,058
When a wick is lit,
the flame that comes out is him.

69
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:15,098
He is an exponent,
who suggests that you be a thief,

70
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:19,569

He was as fast as he had a thousand eyes
and a thousand hands

77
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:26,166
But yet he was not god.

78
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:35,110
lf the sun goes missing from the sky,
he would even sell the sky to find it.

79
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:39,751
When his hands take action
for more man hunts

80
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:41,817
The easier it is to get his enemies,

81
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:44,080
And drench them in a pool of blood
with all the force

82
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:48,818
He burnt the word fear and threw it away.

83
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:52,896
He is an exponent,
who suggests that you be a thief,

84

89
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:05,462
No dad. This is the Trichy to Madurai
via Keeranur bus.

90
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:10,199
No, no. lts leaving now, in 2 minutes.
lt will reach Madurai at 8.30.

91
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:14,368
Ok. l'll come to the bus stand.
- No. l'll come home myself.

92
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,376
Thank you.

93
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:20,316
Rani... Hello Rani!

94
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:26,053
What? Don't you remember me?

95
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:45,610
Please don't cry.

96
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:53,643
l am very scared.
Where could she have gone?

97
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:56,450
lt's almost morning now.

98
00:10:57,523 --> 00:10:59,423
She isn't at any of herfriends place either.

99
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,690
l...l...l...l'll take care of it.
The Department's there...

100
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:07,421
We'll find her...don't cry dear.

101
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:09,834
l'll come back with Rani, bye.

102
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:19,807
Shall l try calling the hostel again?
- Ok..Close the gate.

103
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:56,274
ljust boiled the milk..... What is this?
...Oh my god...What is it?...

104
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:01,617
You go inside.

105
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:08,418
Nothing...it's nothing!

106
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,792
l don't think she is alive.
- Sir. Please.

107
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:51,130
lt was tied to the threshold like an amulet
tied on wrist to ward off evil.

108
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:55,403
l recognized the mole,
that's Rani's finger.

109
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:01,340
How is it possible sir?
Wasn't there a security at the gate?

110
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:03,139
l sent them away.

111
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:05,782
Asked them not to come home
till they had news about Rani.

112
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:08,543
These are the complete reports ...

113
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:18,127
The finger was removed at 6.30.
That's what the report says.

114
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:22,895
Doctor says she was alive
when the finger was severed.

115
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:28,664
Who could it be?
- l don't know.

116
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:30,000
Here, look at this.

117
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:31,767
Someone who wants revenge.

118
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:34,639
Someone who wants to see you cry,
has done this. That's why l asked.

119
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:37,845
l'm confused, so l requested
you to come here.

120
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:44,117
l was a brave policeman,
didn't expect anything to happen.

121
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:47,448
l neverthought of having
a wife and daughter.

122
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:50,752
We feel the pain only
when our shoe pinches.

123
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:56,059
Think about it.
Think of a list of names.

124
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:59,726
People you don't like. People who don't like you.
Something might come up.

125
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:10,547
At ease. At ease.
When did you get here?

126
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:14,712
l was informed at 9 last night
and l took the Rockford.- Good

127
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,114
Just a few minutes before she boarded the bus,

128
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:18,790
Rani has spoken to Mr. Arokiaraj
from that STD booth.

129
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:23,655
Yes. l already told the Police that
she made that call from here.

130
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,297
l even gave them the receipt.

131
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:29,132
Was there anyone else with her?
- No..

132
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:30,057
Huh?

133
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:32,734
No. She was alone.

134
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:35,663
Sir?

135
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:40,134
How far is Rani's college from here?
- Quite close, about 4 Kms.

136
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,674
Did Rani have issues with anyone?

137
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:48,286
No. Sir. She's the quiet type.
She always hangs out with her set of friends.

138
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:49,886
Doesn't interact much with boys.

139
00:14:57,229 --> 00:15:00,164
Havent you eaten? Here... eat this..
Learn to earn your living.

140
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:10,843
What?

141
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:14,142
l am a cop
- Bribe again? They just took it from me.

142
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:17,975
From you as well?
Good ! lts not about that.

143
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:21,851
A girl has been missing from this bus stand
forthe past two days.

144
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:24,284
Can you recognize this person
from the photograph?

145
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:30,117
Yeah. l saw her making a call
from that STD Booth.

146
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:33,821
l have seen her many times.
She was wearing a blue outfit.-When?

147
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:37,124
Day before yesterday.
-Was anyone else with her?

148
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:42,171
There was a guy talking to her and
there was a vehicle on the other side.

149
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:43,807
They left in that.

150
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:45,007
What kind of car?

151
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:52,577
Red colour. Maruti. Like a soap dish.
Flat and Long.

152
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:55,676
Flat and long? You mean a van?
- l don't know..

153
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:58,823
A van's door opens this way.
A car's opens this way.

154
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:01,117
Yes yes. That's the one.

155
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,488
van

156
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:03,320
van

157
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:07,192
Can you identify that guy?

158
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:13,129
He....wore jeans..like this.
He was turned away, couldn't see his face.

159
00:16:13,872 --> 00:16:19,833
Which way did the van go?
- That....way...

160
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:24,345
ls this where you beg everyday?
- Huh? Me? l'm a land lord!

161
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,175
Who you?

162
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:26,547
Me!

163
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:31,787
May you live a hundred years.

164
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,284
Finger analysis...

165
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,757
...was done on Sunday at 4pm.

166
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:43,296
The finger was removed
approximately 22 hours earlier.

167
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:52,774
So.. that means 4... minus .... 22.... is 6pm.

168
00:16:55,748 --> 00:17:03,348
She spoke to Mr. Arogyaraj at 5.30.

169
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:10,561
So everything happened in half an hour
between 5. 30 and 6.-Yes sir.

170
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:18,895
They couldn't have traveled more than
15 minutes from the bus stand.-Yes sir.

171
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:21,297
But sir...this is a straight road...

172
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:25,270
No deviations...one coming up now
is the first left.

173
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:32,008
Please stop the car. Back up...

174
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:44,258
That's enough.

175
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:00,934
What shop is that?

176
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:03,180
l think tender coconut seller's shop sir.

177
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:05,509
Ask them they saw a van pass by.
-Yes sir.

178
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:21,090
Sir, they saw a red Maruthi van.

179
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,860
lt passed by the day before yesterday
in the evening.

180
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,200
Usually vehicles don't turn this way,
that's why he noticed it.

181
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:32,604
Where does this road lead to?

182
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:35,279
lt leads nowhere, Sir. Just a banyan tree
and a forest beyond that.

183
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:54,560
Tire marks end here.

184
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:14,003
From here till there... hey... careful...

185
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,579
We'll stop as soon as
we feel strike some thing, sir.

186
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:20,650
lt's probably not a 'thing' it's a ...
Ok just be careful.

187
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:22,379
Hey.... Careful

188
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:23,750
Slowly

189
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:46,672
Be careful.
-Yes sir

190
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:52,378
What happened Raghavan?

191
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:58,289
Nothing... You could've waited at the station.
You needn't have come here.

192
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:00,048
Got anything? People are digging out.

193
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:03,524
That.... Just a hunch sir.
Nothing to worry....

194
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:07,187
Please wait at the station,
if something comes up l'll let you know...

195
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,432
One minute sir

196
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:14,469
Please wait here sir... l'll...

197
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:36,122
What happened?

198
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:43,731
Sir! l'm sorry! lt's Rani.

199
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,703
l don't think you should see...

200
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:52,844
please... come... Sir... please sir!

201
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:07,189
Sir!... Sir.. don't.. please Sir..

202
00:22:07,392 --> 00:22:08,518
But l'm a father damn it!

203
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:13,027
Sir, as a police man, you know ,Sir!...
You know it's evidence sir...

204
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:15,028
Please No... no...

205
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:16,757
Why my daughter?

206
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:27,205
l'm sorry sir.

207
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:08,916
Sir, excuse me.
Get a hold of him, lift him!

208
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:14,224
Come sir...Please....get a hold of him.

209
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,491
What happened? Rani....?

210
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:26,395
Rani will not come...
our Rani will not come...she's dead.

211
00:23:26,938 --> 00:23:28,303
What? what?

212
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:29,997
Rani is dead!

213
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:38,238
You came all the way
just to dig up my daughter's body?

214
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:40,813
Where's is my daughter?

215
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:41,643
Sir...

216
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:48,957
Sir, Dr. Kamaraj.

217
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:54,227
l am Raghavan, deputy commissioner of Police,
crime branch....

218
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:56,697
On special deputation
l am in charge of this investigation.

219
00:23:56,902 --> 00:23:58,369
So, you are in charge is it?

220
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:01,664
l've never seen such a gory murder in my life.

221
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:07,239
Mode of death - Slitting the throat...
-Weapon?

222
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:10,142
Surgical knife, and it's been done by
someone who knows how to use one.

223
00:24:10,348 --> 00:24:13,784
Not only that, the body has been
bisected into two.

224
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:16,078
Ya l saw. lt was in two halves this morning.

225
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:20,315
She has also been raped
before she was murdered.

226
00:24:20,926 --> 00:24:22,052
Semen traces?

227
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:30,633
He's removed the traces
to avoid DNA identification.

228
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:36,297
The time of murder is probably between 6 - 6:15
the day before yesterday. Excellent...

229
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:38,976
Can you hand overthe reports soon...
forthe investigation?

230
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:40,812
l will hand it over as soon as possible.

231
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:13,940
Raghavan..ljust remembered...

232
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:20,784
Two years ago, there were these guys
who misbehaved with Rani,

233
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:23,545
l bashed them up in a college function.

234
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:27,882
l detained them at the station
for a day and left them.

235
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:34,128
Could it be them? l don't know...

236
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:37,361
Anyway, ljust felt like telling you this.

237
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:38,699
Thank you sir.

238
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:43,930
Arokiaraj Sir wanted it to be confidential.

239
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:49,603
So we left them in his custody
in the station all night and we left.

240
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:52,382
We didn't collect any details about them.

241
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:55,049
They were from Madras.
Not students though.

242
00:25:55,253 --> 00:25:59,519
They regretted their mistake and begged
and pleaded to be released.

243
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:05,526
Couple of useless chaps.
They wouldn't dare do such a thing!

244
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:08,224
Thank you

245
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:09,356
Yes Sir.

246
00:26:22,213 --> 00:26:28,584
Sir, You'll have to be there for Chitra. Goodbye

247
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:39,326
Raghavan, We have to find him.
Not because this is about my Rani.

248
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:43,495
The guy who committed
such a gruesome murder

249
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:47,165
is still a free man somewhere out there.

250
00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:50,773
l can't stand that. We should get him.

251
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:56,235
l'll get him sir. l mean, we'll get him sir.

252
00:27:07,492 --> 00:27:08,652
We are leaving Raghvan.

253
00:27:09,594 --> 00:27:10,492
We are going to New York.

254
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:14,227
Rani wanted to her MS there.

255
00:27:15,266 --> 00:27:16,961
We planned to there with her.

256
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:19,403
But now only l and my wife are going.

257
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:24,306
l fear of losing Chitra too
if l stay back here.

258
00:27:36,521 --> 00:27:38,989
Dosa is ready. Who wants the first?

259
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:43,249
Don't create a tiff in the family.
We can all share. Come dad.

260
00:27:43,461 --> 00:27:43,927
Yeah

261
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:46,097
We shouldn't be eating mutton,
especially afterthe age of 40.

262
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:49,596
Sis, lets become vegetarians from next Sunday?

263
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:51,768
We eat meat only on Sundays, so its ok.

264
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:53,638
l'll answerthe phone.

265
00:27:53,638 --> 00:27:55,765
Sure.Be polite!

266
00:27:58,143 --> 00:28:03,775
Hello..Please wait. l'll call him. Uncle, it's foryou.

267
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,087
Hello. Raghavan here.

268
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:26,837
Sir. l'm sorry sir.

269
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:28,669
When did it happen?

270
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,339
l'll be there in half an hour sir.

271
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:40,082
ljust spoke to the
New York Police a while ago.

272
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:45,854
One Mr. Anderson,
he is the investigating officer.

273
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:47,684
He told me it was an execution.

274
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:52,863
There is a difference between
a murder and an execution right?

275
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:58,092
Arokiaraj was brutally beaten to death.
His wife's throat was slit.

276
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:01,967
l told Mr.Anderson about Rani's death.

277
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,204
He was shocked.

278
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:04,705
He has asked forthe case details.

279
00:29:04,976 --> 00:29:06,375
l have promised to send it.

280
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:07,702
Whats going on Raghavan?

281
00:29:07,979 --> 00:29:10,709
Six months ago it was their daughter,
now its them.

282
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:12,212
Awhole family has been destroyed.

283
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:19,452
There is a connection.
Rani's murder was in Keeranur.

284
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:25,726
This is in New York.
There is something crazy happening.

285
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,233
He has no relatives.

286
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:34,468
They were staying at his brother-in-law's place,
he passed away a year ago.

287
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:38,234
They don't have any family left here orthere.

288
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,239
They sold everything before they left.

289
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,748
We need to give him a decent burial.

290
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:49,684
Atleast l owe him this much.
Actually l owe him more.

291
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:53,155
l need to go there.
Please somehow work me into the case.

292
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:57,324
Sure. l have faxed them about your arrival.

293
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,096
A small introduction.

294
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:00,594
We need to know what exactly happened there

295
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,926
l have also mentioned your rights
to claim the bodies.

296
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:03,600
Thank you sir.

297
00:30:03,768 --> 00:30:06,396
because Arokiaraj was a police officer
of outstanding caliber.

298
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:10,597
l've got Home Ministry approval also.
The New York Police have also asked for help.

299
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:13,937
You can carry all his case files.
But no gun. OK Raghavan?

300
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:15,112
Yeah l understand.

301
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:53,344
l've plenty of information on you.

302
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:56,445
About your honesty,
your impressive arrest record...

303
00:30:56,821 --> 00:30:58,721
You're a rare breed
of upright policeman.

304
00:30:59,123 --> 00:31:02,024
l've got you transfered to
Tirunelveli on a special request.

305
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:08,227
l've brought you to small town
from Chennai, any regrets?

306
00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:09,831
Not at all sir.

307
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:14,061
As a matter of fact, Chennai was getting
a little too fast for me. l like Tirunelveli.

308
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:19,833
Mrs.Arokiaraj... the curry is amazing.
Nothing like Nellai cuisine.

309
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:23,571
Why? Don't you get this kind of food
at your place?

310
00:31:23,948 --> 00:31:26,314
Yeah..But Mom's style is different.

311
00:31:26,517 --> 00:31:27,415
That's a 'Mother's ' touch!.

312
00:31:27,785 --> 00:31:31,585
Now you have a beautiful wife,
why don't you ask herto make it foryou?

313
00:31:31,789 --> 00:31:36,590
Who....? Her...?
Bread, Pizza, Lasagna, Macaroni...

314
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:38,591
l can't figure out if she is cursing me
or narrating the menu.

315
00:31:38,796 --> 00:31:42,755
She doesn't know anything else,
l meant only in regards to cooking.

316
00:31:43,134 --> 00:31:44,999
Why? Don't you like all that?

317
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:51,107
Food is his weakness... and now me!

318
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:54,937
Did you hearthat?
How beautifully she said that?

319
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:56,280
What do you say?

320
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:03,446
You were the talking point
of our discussion.

321
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,682
Did you tell them? What?

322
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:09,289
That you are crazy about me.

323
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:16,795
You've told everyone..
Why won't you tell me?

324
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:20,297
Do l have to? Don't you already know?

325

Team ForCe

326
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:54,495
Ever since l saw you the first time,

327
00:32:55,373 --> 00:33:03,747
Everything seems to be like an illusion...

328
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:12,683
You reached like a wave and
pulled me like a sea.

329
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:21,628
And yourface has become the
logo of my life!

330
00:33:22,066 --> 00:33:30,405
Your eyes say it all...

331
00:33:30,942 --> 00:33:39,213
And l can see the love flowing
through your eyes!

332
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:48,219
l lived my life by seeing the
love in your eyes

333
00:33:48,426 --> 00:33:56,561
And l got drenched in the uniqueness of
your love and l too became rain

334
00:33:57,168 --> 00:34:19,184
Team ForCe

335
00:34:19,957 --> 00:34:28,729
The first thing my eyes search for when
l wake up in the morning is you.

336
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:37,238
And the last thing my eyes will see
before l sleep is you

337
00:34:39,944 --> 00:34:48,477
The adore the way you know the things
l do not know about myself

338
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:57,524
And l am trying my level best to fulfill
your wishes without asking what they are!

339
00:34:57,728 --> 00:35:06,329
You would say it a million times
and nevertake leave

340
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:14,976
And l would force you to do so
and watch you move away...

341
00:35:15,513 --> 00:35:19,472
And l would be at the door, smiling.

342
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:28,154
Your eyes says it all

343
00:35:28,826 --> 00:35:37,063
And l can see the love flowing
through your eyes!

344
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:46,137
You reached like a wave and
pulled me like a sea.

345
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:55,048
And l got drenched in the uniqueness of
your love and l too became rain

346
00:35:55,887 --> 00:36:30,520
Team ForCe

347
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:39,563
l would give up my sleep and admire
the way you smile in your sleep

348
00:36:39,997 --> 00:36:48,666
And l could see you dreaming
the way l was admiring you...

349
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:57,575
l want to build a house far away from
civilization for just you and me,

350
00:36:57,815 --> 00:37:06,382
And l want to etch the lives
we lived on all the trees

351
00:37:06,657 --> 00:37:15,361
You are the only girl, whom l struggle
to talk to when l look into your eyes

352
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:28,843
And you are the only one l can go
on admiring without blinking my eyes.

353
00:37:29,046 --> 00:37:37,146
Ever since l saw you the first time,

354
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:45,819
Everything seems to be like an illusion...

355
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:55,165
You reached like a wave and
pulled me like a sea.

356
00:37:55,373 --> 00:38:03,747
And yourface has become
the logo of my life!

357
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:31,734
Hey.... Who are you? Let go... let go....

358
00:38:41,285 --> 00:38:42,411
Hey... Go ahead and shoot now.

359
00:38:55,132 --> 00:38:56,099
Raghavan...

360
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:49,918
l tried driving as fast as l could ,

361
00:39:51,188 --> 00:39:52,985
but she died before l could get here...
she died in my lap.

362
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,195
Why? Why sir? Why me?

363
00:40:04,468 --> 00:40:05,230
Kayal...

364
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,679
Sir, jewels

365
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:11,894
We could go with a whole task force
or it can just be you and me.

366
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:14,999
Retribution for Kayal's sake.

367
00:41:21,111 --> 00:41:24,342
ls it the place?
Did Dharma called us to this place?

368
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:28,848
Hey...where are you going away?

369
00:41:29,053 --> 00:41:30,179
Please forgive us sir.

370
00:41:30,387 --> 00:41:31,854
Boss! - Stop man.

371
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:39,089
What the hell happened to both of you?

372
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:45,659
Oh! ls it your handiwork?
Haven't you yet mellowed?

373
00:41:47,571 --> 00:41:50,199
Raghavan, you don't know about me.

374
00:41:50,574 --> 00:41:57,537
l know about you ! and
also what your mom does for living!

375
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:02,819
lt's was between you and me?

376
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:07,286
Why did you kill Kayalvizhi you Asshole!

377
00:47:07,424 --> 00:47:08,118
Raghavan

378
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:11,790
Aradhna

379
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:16,291
Why?

380
00:47:19,269 --> 00:47:23,296
Your question sounds like dialogue
from a Mani Ratnam film. 'Why'?

381
00:47:24,741 --> 00:47:25,469
Yes! Why?

382
00:47:27,611 --> 00:47:31,138
l don't know. Stupid right?

383
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:35,810
Actually, just forthe heck of it !

384
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:38,154
Wanted to see what would happen.

385
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:39,982
l could've taken off the cover easily.

386
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:44,658
Just wanted to see how far l dared to go...

387
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:57,167
l saw it in a Ben Kingsley film.
Can't rememberthe name ... but he dies though.

388
00:48:00,444 --> 00:48:01,934
Please don't try this again.

389
00:48:07,084 --> 00:48:12,852
Get the door repaired in the morning.
Sleep well. Good night.

390
00:48:38,148 --> 00:48:40,378
l'm looking for detective Anderson,

391
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:43,553
l think he's expecting me. l'm..

392
00:48:44,187 --> 00:48:48,556
Raghavan? From lndia? Police officer?
Straight up the stairs.

393
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:54,063
Mr. Anderson?

394
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:55,060
Right that way.

395
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:55,731
Thanks.

396
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:02,739
Mr. Anderson?

397
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:05,571
Raghavan right? How was ourtrip?

398
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:06,401
Excellent

399
00:49:16,019 --> 00:49:18,249
Can l see theirfaces please?
- Sure.

400
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:34,767
Thank.. Thank you.

401
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:43,446
Raghavan, we found this underthe stairs.

402
00:49:45,082 --> 00:49:51,453
Forensics show soap and sweat stains
and blood there. Arokiaraj's l think.

403
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:54,116
We're looking for an lndian.

404
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:05,802
These pictures were taken an hour
after we got to the scene of the crime.

405
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:11,966
You're ok?

406
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:13,741
Ya, l'm ok.

407
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:16,878
Oh l'm sorry. l know this guy Raviraj
meant a lot to you.

408
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:34,494
This is it. This is where he and his wife lived.
The house belonged to a relative of her's.

409
00:50:41,638 --> 00:50:43,333
What happened here was an execution.

410
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:54,017
First point of entry was upstairs
on the other side of the house.

411
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:58,187
He must've heard something
and came down the stairs.

412
00:51:06,696 --> 00:51:09,187
He was standing right here
when he was struck forthe first time.

413
00:51:11,168 --> 00:51:15,537
Knocked forward into the door.
You see the splatter?

414
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,231
falls to the ground, no time to react.

415
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:22,204
perpetrators hit him repeatedly
with the baseball bat,

416
00:51:22,446 --> 00:51:25,973
and at some point Arokiaraj pulls the
Rudraksha chain around the killer's neck.

417
00:51:26,183 --> 00:51:29,880
We found him here.
Death wasn't instantaneous.

418
00:51:31,655 --> 00:51:32,952
Because it wasn't meant to be.

419
00:51:35,559 --> 00:51:37,390
Body numbertwo. Upstairs.

420
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:39,228
Arokiaraj's wife Chitra.

421
00:51:41,364 --> 00:51:45,391
He finished off Arokiaraj
and then came up here.

422
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:51,730
walked through the door and slit herthroat.

423
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:10,917
So we found a license for a (walter PPK),
but we didn't find it on the premises.

424
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:14,927
He broke through the fence to get in.
Come on, l'll show you.

425
00:52:18,735 --> 00:52:21,101
Found about half a dozen cigarette butts
on the floor here.

426
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:22,931
Looks like he was definitely
watching the house.

427
00:52:24,708 --> 00:52:26,505
Planned murder and execution.

428
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:40,289
Hello.

429
00:52:42,726 --> 00:52:43,715
How are you?

430
00:52:45,095 --> 00:52:45,891
l'm good.

431
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:50,299
Have you shifted your room?

432
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,398
No.. why?

433
00:52:52,102 --> 00:52:53,126
lsn't that your room?

434
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:55,367
Ya... God.

435
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:04,913
Rani was murdered in Tamil Nadu.

436
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:11,151
Mr and Mrs Arokiaraj were murdered
in New Jersey, New York.

437
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:13,413
lt's possible that both murders were
committed by the same person.

438
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:22,326
So, did he come from Tamil Nadu to America
orfrom America to Keeranur?

439
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:26,001
Seems like both the murders were
committed by the same person.

440
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:30,003
The clues differ and the modus operandi differs.

441
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:39,008
For example, Rani was buried
but Mr and Mrs Arokiaraj were not.

442
00:53:39,816 --> 00:53:40,339
Why?

443
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:51,088
l'll get this guy! Your gonna be caught , man!

444
00:53:58,168 --> 00:53:58,691
Hi.

445
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:02,633
Hello. Have you had breakfast?

446
00:54:02,839 --> 00:54:05,364
No, l'm about to. Nothing is good here.

447
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:07,941
very American. They only serve bread

448
00:54:08,378 --> 00:54:08,867
Then?

449
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:11,881
There's an lndian Caf?across the street.
l'm going there...

450
00:54:12,816 --> 00:54:13,373
Oh... l'm also

451
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:14,481
Come along....

452
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:17,049
No... l meant l was also planning to go there.

453
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:17,720
Oh....

454
00:54:19,322 --> 00:54:20,152
Shall we?

455
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:21,056
Sure

456
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:33,960
Me? Software? l'm a cop.
Hardware! DCP Crimes, Chennai.

457
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:35,897
Oh....

458
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:37,573
Yup! Don't l look it?

459
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:45,305
l don't know. l've never met a cop before.
Neither here northere.

460
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:47,583
l don't know if that's a good thing
or a bad thing!

461
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:49,411
l'm going to get something to drink,
do you want something?

462
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:50,916
Yup. Orange juice.

463
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:08,096
How did you know?

464
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:11,273
Seriously, l've been thinking about it,

465
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:15,774
been meaning to ask you.
How did you know?

466
00:55:17,914 --> 00:55:20,610
When l saw you in the corridor,

467
00:55:21,918 --> 00:55:24,011
l realized you had been crying a lot...

468
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:30,555
yourface kept flashing in my mind,
as l was resting in my room.

469
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:36,360
l knew something was wrong. A hunch. lnstinct.

470
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:43,132
Wow. Awesome.
So, you're the 'Nostradamus' types.

471
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,705
Much worse. A Cop!

472
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:52,243
But what if l was doing something else,

473
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:54,479
like reading a book when you barged in?

474
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:55,651
What would you have done?

475
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:57,714
l would have been embarrassed.
l would've apologized and left!

476
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:03,716
That would have been hilarious ! l wish.

477
00:56:11,768 --> 00:56:16,728
Seattle. The other coast. 5 hours by flight.

478
00:56:17,307 --> 00:56:18,569
Life. Home.

479
00:56:18,942 --> 00:56:21,740
lt was everything for me. 9 months ago.

480
00:56:21,945 --> 00:56:25,972
Suddenly everything ended.
There was nothing left.

481
00:56:26,516 --> 00:56:29,576
Shut up. Don't fucking bug me ok?

482
00:56:30,086 --> 00:56:32,077
Why the fuck do l need to come home
at 10 huh? to do what?

483
00:56:32,288 --> 00:56:35,382
l am with another woman ... its serious.

484
00:56:36,192 --> 00:56:41,596
l want out...l can't stay here anymore,
l may go mad.

485
00:56:45,301 --> 00:56:48,429
Who? ls it Sandhya?

486
00:56:54,811 --> 00:56:58,770
Why did we build a life together?
What do l make of the past two years?

487
00:56:59,382 --> 00:57:01,145
You know what all we went through?

488
00:57:02,652 --> 00:57:04,017
lt was all going great, Arun.

489
00:57:04,654 --> 00:57:08,283
l neverthought it could go bad.
What's wrong with you?

490
00:57:08,525 --> 00:57:11,289
l was pretending, Aradhna.
l pretended to be in love with you.

491
00:57:11,494 --> 00:57:13,587
l don't love you anymore. l'm crazy about her.

492
00:57:13,797 --> 00:57:18,734
Were you pretending?
- Stop it...shit!

493
00:57:22,071 --> 00:57:24,767
He said he has been pretending
all these years.

494
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:31,171
l couldn't handle that. lt's been 9 months.

495
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:33,176
l've been here for4 days.

496
00:57:33,383 --> 00:57:37,615
l thought l'd find myself a job here.
Nothing worked out.

497
00:57:40,089 --> 00:57:41,954
l cried a lot the day before yesterday...

498
00:57:42,158 --> 00:57:48,563
after a long time. l hated it!

499
00:57:49,098 --> 00:57:52,966
So, l thought l'd see if there was
anything beyond life.

500
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:57,072
l found a plastic cover...
that's when you entered.

501
00:57:58,942 --> 00:58:00,307
You don't have to explain yourself.

502
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:01,841
ljust felt like telling you...

503
00:58:02,212 --> 00:58:03,543
Oh then go ahead.

504
00:58:03,746 --> 00:58:04,940
Not just that.

505
00:58:05,615 --> 00:58:07,310
l feel like confiding in someone.

506
00:58:07,717 --> 00:58:11,710
lt's been a while since l have,
besides you're a fellow Tamilian...

507
00:58:12,055 --> 00:58:13,920
you saved my life too. Thanks.

508
00:58:14,123 --> 00:58:15,954
l would have even if l was from Andhra!

509
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:20,755
When you thanked me, did you mean it?

510
00:58:20,964 --> 00:58:22,864
Or would you rather have died?

511
00:58:26,236 --> 00:58:27,294
Thanks

512
00:58:30,874 --> 00:58:32,603
Raghavan, you are not going to believe this.
-What?

513
00:58:32,876 --> 00:58:34,309
Come on. l got to show you something.

514
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:40,048
This is a file from a case in Princeton, New Jersey.

515
00:58:40,583 --> 00:58:42,175
2 years ago, an lndian girl went missing.

516
00:58:42,385 --> 00:58:45,320
She is still missing.
This is what the police there found.

517
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:49,858
A 23 year old medical student Chandana,

518
00:58:50,059 --> 00:58:53,551
Herfinger was found hanging on the
rearview mirror of her boyfriend's car.

519
00:58:54,931 --> 00:58:56,796
With the chillies and the lemon.
-Yeah

520
00:58:58,334 --> 00:59:00,598
When you told me about Rani and how she died,
with herfinger in the doorway,

521
00:59:00,803 --> 00:59:01,462
Yeah

522
00:59:01,938 --> 00:59:03,496
l felt kind of strange about it.

523
00:59:04,107 --> 00:59:05,574
And this morning, it struck me what it was.

524
00:59:05,775 --> 00:59:08,767
So l called my friend in Princeton
and this is what he sent me.

525
00:59:18,288 --> 00:59:19,277
Well, There you have it.

526
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:34,833
Hello, tell me Radhavan

527
00:59:35,171 --> 00:59:39,335
We can be certain that the
murderer is from our country

528
00:59:39,709 --> 00:59:41,973
He wears a Rudraksh around his neck.

529
00:59:42,178 --> 00:59:44,738
He had been watching Mr.Arokiaraj
and his wife for a long time

530
00:59:44,948 --> 00:59:47,917
before he planned to murdered them.

531
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:50,610
l am sure that there is
some connection between

532
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:52,788
this and the Keeranur murder
that happened 9 months ago.

533
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:57,950
Someone has taken revenge.
They have wiped out an entire family.

534
00:59:58,161 --> 01:00:01,562
We still have to figure out if he is from
around here or if he came from lndia.

535
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:03,789
Another bizarre bit of information,

536
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,969
There was a finger hanging outside
Arokiraj's residence in Madurai, right?

537
01:00:07,170 --> 01:00:11,937
Similarly they found anotherfinger here,
hanging in a car's rearview mirror.

538
01:00:12,575 --> 01:00:14,372
That of a girl's, the same talisman,

539
01:00:14,577 --> 01:00:17,910
chillies and a lemon in between,
just like the one in Trichy.

540
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:20,514
Raghavan. use the landline.
- No. lt's ok.

541
01:00:20,717 --> 01:00:23,311
You sure?
-Yeah. Sorry sir.

542
01:00:24,587 --> 01:00:27,852
This girl was also lndian.
The case is still open.

543
01:00:28,057 --> 01:00:32,255
She's still missing. The hanging finger
is similarto Rani's case.

544
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:35,397
Details of whom she was last seen with,
where she lived,

545
01:00:35,598 --> 01:00:37,998
which road she was last seen
on is all available here.

546
01:00:38,201 --> 01:00:40,726
Yeah. l am going to check it out sir.

547
01:00:42,105 --> 01:00:46,906
l am going to see if l can find a
dead body here like the one in Keeranur.

548
01:00:49,245 --> 01:00:50,576
We must find him.

549
01:00:52,048 --> 01:00:53,845
l'm not seeking revenge
for my Rani's death.

550
01:00:56,052 --> 01:00:58,213
Killed a girl so barbarously

551
01:00:59,222 --> 01:01:02,851
l couldn't bearto see
the mangled body.

552
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:05,518
We should get him.

553
01:01:19,909 --> 01:01:21,308
l want you to sign!

554
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:22,409
l don't need your money.

555
01:01:22,612 --> 01:01:23,704
l don't want your money!

556
01:01:23,913 --> 01:01:25,608
What do you think?
That l am dependent on you?

557
01:01:25,915 --> 01:01:30,545
l told you that l am not interested.
Sign here.

558
01:01:30,753 --> 01:01:33,153
Don't! lf you touch me again, l'll call 911!

559
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:34,717
Do you want me to do that Arun?

560
01:01:34,924 --> 01:01:37,518
Sign it. And then its over.

561
01:01:37,727 --> 01:01:42,755
So you live happily is it? l wont sign it.
Take a walk. Get out.

562
01:01:42,965 --> 01:01:44,057
What's happening here?

563
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:48,227
What is it to you, man? Who are you?

564
01:01:48,438 --> 01:01:51,407
Me? l am staying next door.

565
01:01:51,607 --> 01:01:55,407
l can't stand the noise!.
l will have to report it to the management.

566
01:01:55,611 --> 01:01:57,909
Dude! Who the hell are you?

567
01:01:58,114 --> 01:01:59,581
You can go and complain
anywhere you want!

568
01:01:59,782 --> 01:02:04,151
l will make noise! lf it bothers you,
move into a 5 star hotel!

569
01:02:04,353 --> 01:02:05,377
Arun! Please.

570
01:02:05,955 --> 01:02:08,924
Mr. Raghavan .. its nothing! Please leave!

571
01:02:09,125 --> 01:02:11,423
Are you all right?
-Yeah

572
01:02:11,627 --> 01:02:15,859
Hey. You've hit her.

573
01:02:16,065 --> 01:02:19,762
Didn't they everteach you neverto
raise your hand against a woman?

574
01:02:19,969 --> 01:02:21,596
You...

575
01:02:21,804 --> 01:02:24,739
Leave him alone. Leave him Arun!

576
01:02:29,178 --> 01:02:30,941
You've found someone else so soon huh?

577
01:02:31,147 --> 01:02:32,444
Hey hey hey!

578
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:36,348
l don't know who she is.

579
01:02:37,887 --> 01:02:41,516
My name is Raghavan.
Deputy Commissioner of Police, Chennai.

580
01:02:42,992 --> 01:02:44,789
l stay next door. l heard something.

581
01:02:44,994 --> 01:02:46,461
l came here and saw that you had hit her.

582
01:02:46,662 --> 01:02:48,129
lf you hadn't hit her,
l wouldn't have interfered.

583
01:02:48,331 --> 01:02:49,798
But you have.

584
01:02:49,999 --> 01:02:53,298
l hate violence against women,
even if it isn't my jurisdiction.

585
01:02:53,803 --> 01:02:56,363
So l have invited myself to this party my friend.

586
01:02:56,839 --> 01:02:58,500
You shouldn't touch her. That's all l want.

587
01:02:58,708 --> 01:03:00,471
What's happening here?

588
01:03:00,676 --> 01:03:02,405
Do you think your watching a show or something?

589
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:03,874
Arun, get out.

590
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:04,637
Leave the papers here.

591
01:03:04,847 --> 01:03:07,008
l'll sign them and have it you.
lsn't that all you want?

592
01:03:29,772 --> 01:03:31,501
l'm sorry Aradhna.

593
01:03:32,175 --> 01:03:34,837
l don't think l should have interfered this evening.

594
01:03:38,781 --> 01:03:45,414
When l saw that he had hit you,
l lost my temper and over reacted.

595
01:03:45,922 --> 01:03:49,358
No. its ok. lts all good. Thank you actually.

596
01:03:51,961 --> 01:03:54,259
Still, he shouldn't have hit you. That's not done.

597
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:20,220
This is yourfirst time in America, isn't it?-Yes.

598
01:04:21,591 --> 01:04:24,082
For me too. l mean in New York.

599
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:26,655
l've heard that Times Square
is always this way.

600
01:04:27,163 --> 01:04:28,391
People...Lots of people.

601
01:04:28,598 --> 01:04:31,965
Lots of Cars. lt's like this all night.

602
01:04:32,168 --> 01:04:35,797
Just like Bombay. Nice, isn't it ?
-Yeah.

603
01:04:49,418 --> 01:04:51,613
What were you saying?

604
01:04:55,858 --> 01:04:57,155
l was married.

605
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:59,255
You are
- l was. Past tense.

606
01:05:00,062 --> 01:05:03,828
She passed away.

607
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:11,966
She was just 28. lt's been 8 years.

608
01:05:12,174 --> 01:05:14,768
l am really sorry. l didn't know.

609
01:05:15,111 --> 01:05:16,544
Don't misunderstand me.

610
01:05:16,979 --> 01:05:18,844
No it's allright. lt's fine.

611
01:05:22,251 --> 01:05:26,881
What was her name?
- Kayalvizhi (eyes like a fish)

612
01:05:27,924 --> 01:05:30,893
That was just her name.
But, she had big, round eyes.

613
01:05:31,093 --> 01:05:32,287
She was very beautiful.

614
01:05:32,662 --> 01:05:33,720
Where did you meet her?

615
01:05:35,431 --> 01:05:38,025
We met at a wedding.
lt was love at first sight !

616
01:05:38,234 --> 01:05:39,030
l proposed to her immediately.

617
01:05:39,235 --> 01:05:40,293
l love you!

618
01:05:42,571 --> 01:05:45,734
lt's only been 2 hours since we met
and how can you be in love already?

619
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:47,773
l would have told you within 2 mins.

620
01:05:47,977 --> 01:05:51,413
l didn't want you to misunderstand me,
so l waited for 2 hours.

621
01:05:53,115 --> 01:05:55,413
Look. l am a police officer.

622
01:05:55,618 --> 01:06:00,021
Don't think l am the strict, stiff,
reserved type, l talk a lot!

623
01:06:00,222 --> 01:06:01,883
Actually, l am quite fun to be with!

624
01:06:02,358 --> 01:06:04,656
l'll take very good care of you and our children!

625
01:06:04,894 --> 01:06:06,054
This is too fast for me!

626
01:06:06,262 --> 01:06:08,526
Look here Kayal.
This might seem too fast foryou.

627
01:06:08,731 --> 01:06:12,428
But it's too slow for me.
lf you say 'No' then fine.

628
01:06:12,902 --> 01:06:15,666
lf not today, then we can get married tomorrow!

629
01:06:15,871 --> 01:06:17,498
What? What are you saying?

630
01:06:17,707 --> 01:06:19,265
l am saying please marry me!

631
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:21,906
''Tomorrow isn't auspicious,

632
01:06:22,578 --> 01:06:25,604
So get married the day after!''
is what her mother said.

633
01:06:25,815 --> 01:06:28,010
we got married the day after!

634
01:06:28,217 --> 01:06:31,186
What? She agreed? Then and there?

635
01:06:32,421 --> 01:06:33,683
Someone might hear us.

636
01:06:33,889 --> 01:06:37,518
Exactly. Before someone else
could propose, l did.

637
01:06:38,027 --> 01:06:40,120
Will you...will you?

638
01:06:43,065 --> 01:06:49,971
What? See, someone is already
coming between us... What?

639
01:06:52,742 --> 01:06:55,870
l could see it in her eyes that she liked me too,

640
01:06:56,445 --> 01:06:59,073
Which is why l dared to propose.
- Oh

641
01:06:59,582 --> 01:07:01,880
Yeah... it's in the eyes,
you can always tell from the eyes,

642
01:07:02,084 --> 01:07:03,551
Especially if your a Cop!
- Nice!

643
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:12,324
Kayal was 5 months pregnant when she died.

644
01:07:20,002 --> 01:07:22,562
lt was too painful.
l became bitter.

645
01:07:22,772 --> 01:07:24,296
l've never been that way,

646
01:07:24,673 --> 01:07:27,437
l got mad at myself for being like that.

647
01:07:28,344 --> 01:07:32,303
But..l feel a lot better after confiding in you.

648
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:38,445
A lot of people say the same thing to me.

649
01:07:45,227 --> 01:07:46,990
What's it like without her?

650
01:07:58,407 --> 01:08:00,432
l shouldn't have asked. l'm..sorry...

651
01:08:00,643 --> 01:08:02,008
No. No. lt's alright. .

652
01:08:03,979 --> 01:08:09,042
l miss her. lt's been 8 years.

653
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:16,221
Mom, Dad, Work, my Sisters, their kids,

654
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:24,790
they keep me going and of course there's time.

655
01:08:27,002 --> 01:08:28,560
Time sort of heals everything.

656
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:33,405
That reminds me. Go to sleep. Happily.

657
01:08:33,976 --> 01:08:37,139
Don't worry about it too much.
Everything will be ok in the morning.

658
01:08:37,446 --> 01:08:38,970
At least that's what l tell myself.

659
01:08:41,283 --> 01:08:43,547
Chandana's mom is a little surprised
that an lndian cop wants to meet her.

660
01:08:47,289 --> 01:08:49,086
CHANDANA'S Mom : l saw her last at 7.

661
01:08:49,291 --> 01:08:52,488
She was standing nearthe car
and talking to Hitesh.

662
01:08:52,695 --> 01:08:55,994
Ten minutes later, she still hadn't walked in,
so l looked out.

663
01:08:56,198 --> 01:08:58,393
She wasn't there nor was Hitesh's car.

664
01:08:58,601 --> 01:09:01,399
The next day, herfinger was found
hanging in Hitesh's car.

665
01:09:01,604 --> 01:09:03,697
l have been answering the
same question for 2 years, sir.

666
01:09:03,906 --> 01:09:10,778
Just once more, was anyone jealous of
your relationship with Chandana?

667
01:09:11,013 --> 01:09:13,140
Not that l know of.

668
01:09:13,249 --> 01:09:14,511
How long have you known Hitesh?
- For a long time.

669
01:09:14,717 --> 01:09:16,844
We know him very well too.
He's a good chap.

670
01:09:17,052 --> 01:09:18,576
So, you're a doctor is it?

671
01:09:18,787 --> 01:09:21,119
Yeah. Both me and Chandana
went to the same University.

672
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:22,950
'Brooklyn Medical University'.

673
01:09:29,598 --> 01:09:30,565
Abbott Road.

674
01:09:30,766 --> 01:09:33,257
She was seen here at 8.30 pm
getting out of a car with a man.

675
01:09:44,780 --> 01:09:48,045
The report says the finger
was severed around 9 pm.

676
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:50,150
She was last seen here at 8.30 pm.

677
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:52,119
So, where did she go from here?

678
01:09:57,193 --> 01:09:58,160
What's up?

679
01:09:58,861 --> 01:10:01,159
Princeton police...

680
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:04,158
Come on. We're wasting ourtime.

681
01:10:04,366 --> 01:10:05,833
There is nothing here but dead leaves.

682
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:09,099
l don't think so.
l have a gut feeling about this.

683
01:10:09,305 --> 01:10:10,169
You have a what?

684
01:10:12,741 --> 01:10:15,266
Back home, it is called
'The Raghavan instinct'.

685
01:10:16,278 --> 01:10:17,245
Come again?

686
01:10:17,846 --> 01:10:18,471
Come!

687
01:10:21,917 --> 01:10:24,181
This place has been closed
to the public for a couple of years.

688
01:10:24,386 --> 01:10:25,910
lt's just an abandoned fort.

689
01:10:26,622 --> 01:10:28,954
No...We cant go in here Raghavan!
There is 'no trespassing sign'!

690
01:10:29,291 --> 01:10:30,485
Oh yeah. lts locked.

691
01:10:38,734 --> 01:10:40,133
Ah shit. You...cant...

692
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:41,934
Come.

693
01:12:18,867 --> 01:12:19,834
Did you see that?

694
01:12:45,327 --> 01:12:46,259
Maggots?

695
01:12:49,665 --> 01:12:51,633
You don't want me to dig this place up, do you?

696
01:12:53,268 --> 01:12:54,166
l do.

697
01:12:59,775 --> 01:13:01,640
God damn. l am going to look like an idiot.

698
01:13:28,971 --> 01:13:31,269
Jesus! There's more
than one body in here.

699
01:13:34,576 --> 01:13:36,043
You got 4 corpses.

700
01:13:53,095 --> 01:13:54,221
Thanks.

701
01:14:10,179 --> 01:14:11,771
Hey Anderson. NYPD is here.

702
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:13,607
Yeah. Four (dead bodies) .
They've been here a while.

703
01:14:13,816 --> 01:14:14,942
Up here.

704
01:14:52,387 --> 01:14:53,081
Tell me, Raghavan.

705
01:14:53,288 --> 01:14:55,620
Sir. We've found that girl's body.

706
01:14:55,824 --> 01:15:00,056
What? -Yes. We also found 3 other bodies.

707
01:15:00,262 --> 01:15:01,286
4 bodies all together.

708
01:15:01,497 --> 01:15:03,624
All in different stages of decomposition.

709
01:15:03,999 --> 01:15:10,461
The last one that we found was
Chandana's body with a missing finger.

710
01:15:10,706 --> 01:15:12,333
All of them have been killed by the same guy.

711
01:15:12,541 --> 01:15:14,270
lts obvious a single burial site.

712
01:15:14,476 --> 01:15:15,807
He is a serial killer Sir.

713
01:15:16,011 --> 01:15:20,311
The only mistake made was the fingers
he left hanging, both here and there (lndia).

714
01:15:20,516 --> 01:15:25,476
l think that the first body we found
was buried 2 months ago.

715
01:15:25,687 --> 01:15:29,851
Rani died 9 months ago, in lndia.

716
01:15:30,058 --> 01:15:37,624
The second body that we found here
was buried 9 months ago.

717
01:15:37,833 --> 01:15:43,897
So, l think our killertraveled to lndia in between
those two murders and returned to the States.

718
01:15:44,106 --> 01:15:47,974
As soon as we receive post mortem reports
along with the time / date of death,

719
01:15:48,176 --> 01:15:53,614
we should be able to narrow it down
using the manifesto of passengers

720
01:15:53,815 --> 01:15:55,339
who traveled to Chennai around that time.

721
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:56,916
Brilliant. Raghavan!
- Thank you, Sir.!

722
01:15:57,119 --> 01:15:58,814
l have asked them not to give
a press release.

723
01:15:59,021 --> 01:16:00,545
So that the matter stays confidential,

724
01:16:00,756 --> 01:16:03,452
between the FBl and the police department.

725
01:16:03,659 --> 01:16:07,561
l believe that since he has buried
all the women in the same location,

726
01:16:07,763 --> 01:16:11,358
he will come back to the site.

727
01:16:11,733 --> 01:16:14,133
So there are 2 police officers
on surveillance in that area.

728
01:16:14,336 --> 01:16:15,701
Something will turn up.

729
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:19,533
Keep me posted. Yes sir. l will !

730
01:16:19,942 --> 01:16:21,239
Right. Thank you.

731
01:16:47,836 --> 01:16:51,499
Hi. l had a feeling that you walked past.

732
01:16:51,707 --> 01:16:52,969
l was right.

733
01:16:54,209 --> 01:16:57,667
l also have Police lnstinct l guess,
right Nostradamus?

734
01:17:00,916 --> 01:17:04,477
How was your day?
You're here on official work right?

735
01:17:04,786 --> 01:17:08,552
Have you found the suspect?
- l will.

736
01:17:10,692 --> 01:17:12,057
l had an interview today.

737
01:17:12,260 --> 01:17:15,252
lt went well. l have been
asked to join next month.

738
01:17:15,464 --> 01:17:17,432
Congrats.
- Thanks.

739
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:22,669
Also...l signed my divorce papers
and couriered it to him.

740
01:17:24,906 --> 01:17:28,467
l'm sorry.
-Why? l don't regret it.

741
01:17:28,677 --> 01:17:31,771
l was upset till yesterday but l'm relieved now.

742
01:17:32,648 --> 01:17:35,014
l want to go ahead now ...

743
01:17:37,653 --> 01:17:40,315
Are you heading out?
- Need to take a showerfirst.

744
01:17:40,522 --> 01:17:42,615
Change, then everything else follows...

745
01:17:44,593 --> 01:17:48,029
lf you're not doing anything else afterthat,
dinner's on me!

746
01:17:48,630 --> 01:17:51,827
l have two reasons to celebrate.

747
01:17:56,071 --> 01:17:58,130
lf .. you' re not busy with anything else ?

748
01:17:58,740 --> 01:18:00,469
l did have plans.

749
01:18:00,676 --> 01:18:05,045
But now, its all cancelled... 15 minutes?

750
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:15,047
The sparkling moon,

751
01:18:15,257 --> 01:18:20,627
The silver sparkling moon
keeps following me wherever!

752
01:18:22,931 --> 01:18:26,332
The sparkling moon,

753
01:18:26,535 --> 01:18:31,939
The silver sparkling moon brought along
all the stars in the sky!

Team ForCe

755
01:18:53,061 --> 01:19:00,832
The sun is setting slow
and it is yellow....

756
01:19:01,036 --> 01:19:08,238
The lights that are glowing
makes it feel like its day!

757
01:19:09,144 --> 01:19:16,676
Hesitations come to an end
and the heartbeat begins to double...

758
01:19:17,119 --> 01:19:23,854
And keeps searching for what next!

759
01:19:24,059 --> 01:19:27,153
The sparkling moon,

The silver sparkling moon brought
along all the stars in the sky!

763
01:19:41,109 --> 01:19:48,777
lt seems as if the world is coming
to an end today,

764
01:19:49,151 --> 01:19:55,954
And even after such long discussions,
it seems like something has been missed out!

765
01:19:57,292 --> 01:20:12,037
A small change in me felt like a
lightening appearing here and there...

766
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:15,209
The sparkling moon,

767
01:20:15,410 --> 01:20:19,710
The silver sparkling moon keeps
following me wherever!

Some people take the path
which is not colourful

776
01:21:40,495 --> 01:21:48,266
And suddenly get drenched in rain
that are shades of yellow and green...

777
01:21:48,470 --> 01:21:56,104
Who is this woman? Who is this guy?

778
01:21:56,478 --> 01:22:00,244
Seems like the parallel lines can intersect

779
01:22:00,448 --> 01:22:04,179
And two different tracks can converge!

l wish this moment could be extended,

785
01:22:29,411 --> 01:22:36,579
And after such a long time,
it would be a moment to cherish!

786
01:22:37,519 --> 01:22:45,221
l did not have the time to stop in my life,

787
01:22:45,427 --> 01:22:48,328
But she stopped me and spoke to me...

788
01:22:48,530 --> 01:22:52,762
And after such a long time,
it was a moment to cherish!

Team ForCe

790
01:24:24,765 --> 01:24:27,700
Mr. Raghavan had already started
an investigation

791
01:24:27,901 --> 01:24:30,597
into his colleague's daughter's murder in lndia

792
01:24:30,804 --> 01:24:35,764
and it was his intuition and expertise that
lead us to the bodies in the woods.

793
01:24:37,344 --> 01:24:39,812
We are now on a hunt for a serial killer.

794
01:24:40,013 --> 01:24:45,781
Anderson from the NYPD did a good job
by consulting the lndian Police..

795
01:24:51,024 --> 01:24:56,656
l think the murder of Ann Morrison in
February 2005 is the key here.

796
01:24:58,098 --> 01:25:04,435
The perpetrator was here 2005 Feb 10th,
for Ann Morrison.

797
01:25:04,605 --> 01:25:09,065
Then he goes back and he murders Rani
on Feb 20th.

798
01:25:09,610 --> 01:25:12,306
He comes back again for Lisa.

799
01:25:12,613 --> 01:25:15,707
lf we could get the passengers manifest
from the immigration,

800
01:25:15,916 --> 01:25:18,043
people who traveled from here to lndia,

801
01:25:18,252 --> 01:25:19,480
February 10th to the 20th,

802
01:25:19,686 --> 01:25:25,147
and we can find a connection between one of the
passengers and the victims, we got our man.

803
01:25:25,359 --> 01:25:26,826
Sorry, suspect.

804
01:25:35,936 --> 01:25:36,766
We'll get him.

805
01:25:39,473 --> 01:25:44,274
Yeah. Who is this guy?
He is out there somewhere.

806
01:26:00,327 --> 01:26:01,123
Why are you asking Amudha?

807
01:26:01,328 --> 01:26:02,920
l'm checking a diagnosis gone wrong.

808
01:26:03,497 --> 01:26:06,364
lf surgery is not an option,
then chemotheraphy.

809
01:26:07,167 --> 01:26:08,828
This guy took me so wrong.

810
01:26:09,169 --> 01:26:11,137
Nobody can catch us.

811
01:26:11,338 --> 01:26:14,671
We're the best Doctors in the world!
Lets go back to our country.

812
01:26:19,012 --> 01:26:20,639
We'll start our own hospital.

813
01:26:21,215 --> 01:26:24,207
We'll dedicate our lives
to the benefit of Society!.

814
01:26:25,185 --> 01:26:27,210
There shall be no more DEATH in this world!

815
01:26:28,856 --> 01:26:31,552
What the fuck is wrong with you?

816
01:26:31,758 --> 01:26:34,386
Let me go. Let me go.

817
01:26:34,595 --> 01:26:38,395
Shut up...fucking bitch..

818
01:26:42,236 --> 01:26:45,467
Look at me. Look at me. lt's me.

819
01:26:45,672 --> 01:26:49,904
l don't like your voice.
Don't make any noise.

820
01:26:51,812 --> 01:26:58,081
Please. Please. Let me go. No no no no.

821
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:04,012
l'll give you money.
- l don't need your money.

822
01:27:26,980 --> 01:27:29,210
Professor veronica, l am really sorry.

823
01:27:30,250 --> 01:27:33,276
But you should have been nice to me
in class.

824
01:27:55,342 --> 01:27:59,438
Freeze! Put your hands above your head
and turn around!

825
01:27:59,513 --> 01:28:04,007
Turn around very slowly and walk
towards the vehicle.

826
01:28:04,851 --> 01:28:07,513
Put your hands on the hood.
-Just stopped to take a leak guys.

827
01:28:07,754 --> 01:28:09,984
No! Turn, turn!

828
01:28:10,324 --> 01:28:16,354
Okay guys..lla,
there's are only 2 of them. ...Shoot!

829
01:28:16,563 --> 01:28:17,587
What are you rambling on for?

830
01:28:17,798 --> 01:28:21,996
Walk towards the vehicle
and put your hands on the hood.

831
01:28:22,235 --> 01:28:25,898
A man's got to take a leak. Common,
what's it with you guys?

832
01:28:26,540 --> 01:28:29,008
Hey, easy there you are hurting me.

833
01:28:39,419 --> 01:28:40,716
Wait, let me take a look.

834
01:28:43,623 --> 01:28:47,320
Amudha! - llla, there is no one else no?

835
01:28:47,661 --> 01:28:49,288
They've found it.! Dogs.

836
01:28:49,496 --> 01:28:53,796
They've dug it up! Lets get out of here!

837
01:29:00,340 --> 01:29:01,773
Watch your step. Raghavan.

838
01:29:02,776 --> 01:29:03,868
Hello sir.
- Hello

839
01:29:04,077 --> 01:29:05,009
Good evening.

840
01:29:05,679 --> 01:29:07,704
There's been a shooting at the gates
two hours ago.

841
01:29:10,450 --> 01:29:12,111
From yesterdays crime scene.

842
01:29:14,021 --> 01:29:17,616
Two of our guys on surveillance was killed.

843
01:29:34,274 --> 01:29:36,834
l need another 500 names and
l need them tonight.

01:30:18,919 --> 01:30:20,716
Only someone who has trained to use one,
could have done this

849
01:30:20,921 --> 01:30:23,048
Ya. Me and Chandana went to
the same university,

01:31:07,134 --> 01:31:11,594
and came back in 2 weeks.
Shopping, wedding...you know how it is.

857
01:31:12,272 --> 01:31:13,296
Can they vouch forthat?

858
01:31:13,406 --> 01:31:14,430
Of course they can vouch!

859
01:31:14,641 --> 01:31:16,871
My father can vouch my wife can vouch.

860
01:31:17,144 --> 01:31:18,839
My father was in the hospital.

861
01:31:19,045 --> 01:31:20,945
He was there for 2 weeks, l went to see him.

862
01:31:35,228 --> 01:31:36,456
Yes, l know llamaran.

863
01:31:36,663 --> 01:31:40,394
He always sticks to a class mate of his
a brilliant student, class topper.

864
01:31:40,767 --> 01:31:43,964
They used to stay on campus.
-what's he saying? -but now they've shifted.

865
01:31:45,338 --> 01:31:46,805
He said llamaran always 'sticks' with his friend.

866
01:31:47,007 --> 01:31:47,974
do you know the address?

867
01:31:48,208 --> 01:31:51,302
Ya. Place in Brooklyin. Spring Street, 16F.

868
01:31:51,511 --> 01:31:52,478
He should know the place

869
01:31:52,746 --> 01:31:53,644
You know the place?

870
01:32:33,486 --> 01:32:35,181
Open up! NYPD!

871
01:32:38,892 --> 01:32:40,860
No.. l don't think there's anyone
in there-Wait wait wait..

872
01:32:42,062 --> 01:32:43,029
Can't we go in?

873
01:32:43,230 --> 01:32:44,857
No we cant! We don't have a warrant!

874
01:32:45,565 --> 01:32:48,693
No what l meant was can't
you pick the lock for me?

875
01:32:48,902 --> 01:32:50,699
No l can't pick the lock foryou!
Are you kidding me?

876
01:32:51,404 --> 01:32:53,031
We do it all the time in lndia.

877
01:33:26,273 --> 01:33:32,075
Hey Anderson! You should
take a look at this!

878
01:33:33,546 --> 01:33:34,808
You should take a look at this!

879
01:33:59,306 --> 01:33:59,931
Anderson!

880
01:35:27,060 --> 01:35:27,856
Take that!

881
01:35:38,571 --> 01:35:39,697
How did you get here, Cop?

882
01:35:39,906 --> 01:35:41,533
l should've killed you in Keeranur !

883
01:37:15,502 --> 01:37:15,968
What the fuckin shit?

884
01:37:19,005 --> 01:37:20,131
Whats wrong with this gun?

885
01:37:22,175 --> 01:37:25,872
llla, wake up! l need help..
l need your help to kill him...get up.

886
01:37:28,348 --> 01:37:29,474
Shit...

887
01:37:30,683 --> 01:37:32,810
Give it to me! lll teach you how to use it.

888
01:37:39,459 --> 01:37:40,892
You are going to die in half an hour.

889
01:37:41,361 --> 01:37:43,829
You've got a severe lung puncture you know...

890
01:37:44,430 --> 01:37:45,897
l've ruptured your lungs ...

891
01:37:46,099 --> 01:37:48,897
you've lost a lot of blood,
that's why yourfeeling dizzy.

892
01:37:49,235 --> 01:37:52,568
ln a few minutes your going to have
a blood clot form in your lungs,

893
01:37:53,039 --> 01:37:54,336
you won't be able to breathe
and then you will die!

894
01:37:54,807 --> 01:37:57,833
The cops will be here in 10 mins!

895
01:37:58,044 --> 01:37:59,170
lf they were coming, they
would've been here by now.

896
01:37:59,479 --> 01:38:02,346
We've been sleeping forthe
last 10 mins! - like a happy family! .

897
01:38:02,715 --> 01:38:07,175
But they aren't here yet! Shit!

898
01:38:07,387 --> 01:38:09,184
Why do you keep saying shit?

899
01:38:09,556 --> 01:38:11,023
ls that your Mom's name?

900
01:38:21,234 --> 01:38:23,600
Pain killer man! Fuckin paining!

901
01:38:26,306 --> 01:38:30,208
l neverthought you would get here.

902
01:38:30,977 --> 01:38:34,879
l saw you in Keeranur digging
up the remains of Rani.

903
01:38:35,415 --> 01:38:38,942
l thought l'd kill you, you were staying
at the Pandian Hotel right?

904
01:38:39,252 --> 01:38:40,048
but he held me back!

905
01:38:40,587 --> 01:38:43,556
lf l had killed you then
you wouldn't have come this far!.

906
01:38:43,756 --> 01:38:44,882
How the hell did you find out?

907
01:38:46,926 --> 01:38:51,886
Don't think you've won.
You can't get me.

908
01:38:52,298 --> 01:38:53,629
You can never catch us!!

909
01:38:54,434 --> 01:38:56,561
What do you mean?
You think your like air?

910
01:38:57,937 --> 01:38:58,403
We can't 'catch' you?
Asshole! come....

911
01:39:11,184 --> 01:39:12,742
Shall l tell you something?

912
01:39:13,886 --> 01:39:17,253
Your dearfriend cried and begged
for his life when he died.

913
01:39:17,957 --> 01:39:21,984
He didn't struggle much, which was
surprising, him being a cop!

914
01:39:22,195 --> 01:39:24,186
Only his wife struggled a lot.

915
01:39:24,464 --> 01:39:27,922
Quite a bitch she was!
and one hell of a lay!

916
01:39:29,902 --> 01:39:31,096
Why did you kill her?

917
01:39:31,904 --> 01:39:33,428
Oh ! you don't know the reason?

918
01:39:34,307 --> 01:39:35,604
His daughter died because of him.

919
01:39:35,808 --> 01:39:38,606
and he died because of his daughter so
why spare the mother?

920
01:39:38,811 --> 01:39:39,277
Have you seen you face?

921
01:39:39,579 --> 01:39:42,673
l wouldn't even hit you with
my slipper! Give me the tape!

922
01:39:44,117 --> 01:39:46,608
l don't like Rani! That's all!

923
01:39:46,819 --> 01:39:48,286
Go tell your dad someone felt you up.

924
01:39:48,488 --> 01:39:49,284
You bloody dog!

925
01:39:51,324 --> 01:39:51,949
Let go of me!

926
01:39:56,262 --> 01:39:58,287
Hey llla, look there...

927
01:39:58,898 --> 01:39:59,626
That's him.

928
01:39:59,832 --> 01:40:01,732
He hit me... Motherfucker...

929
01:40:04,904 --> 01:40:09,364
He could've left it at that
instead of proving he's a Cop.

930
01:40:09,575 --> 01:40:10,803
That's where he made his mistake.

931
01:40:11,010 --> 01:40:11,635
What did they do?

932
01:40:12,011 --> 01:40:15,310
They misbehaved with his daughter sir.

933
01:40:26,526 --> 01:40:27,823
Hey Mayil! What's up?

934
01:40:28,127 --> 01:40:29,594
You usually come only at
the end of the month, right?

935
01:40:29,796 --> 01:40:31,593
Oh just like that... thought
l would pay you a visit.

936
01:40:31,798 --> 01:40:35,495
Not today. May be next week...

937
01:40:35,668 --> 01:40:38,068
ls it so? Ok, l will go then.

938
01:40:38,304 --> 01:40:39,168
Wait ...

939
01:40:41,708 --> 01:40:44,506
Oh my god! You guys are so hot!

940
01:40:44,877 --> 01:40:49,337
One of you is black and the other white.
very nice.

941
01:40:49,549 --> 01:40:52,074
l hated what he did and l was scared.

942
01:40:52,785 --> 01:40:54,753
l have a problem with people like that.

943
01:40:54,954 --> 01:40:56,285
l had not committed a murder in 3 years.

944
01:40:56,556 --> 01:40:57,750
l can't stay patient anymore.

945
01:40:59,058 --> 01:41:00,025
We have to kill them!

946
01:41:00,293 --> 01:41:02,284
Like how people want to give up smoking,

947
01:41:02,729 --> 01:41:04,856
l wanted to give up killing!

948
01:41:06,065 --> 01:41:11,196
But they brought out the devil in me!

949
01:41:11,404 --> 01:41:12,428
What can we do?

950
01:41:14,807 --> 01:41:18,538
Stretch your legs... asshole... stretch your legs....

951
01:41:22,148 --> 01:41:25,606
l wanted to kill all of them NOW!.

952
01:41:25,818 --> 01:41:29,049
First l want to kill the girl.
Then herfather,

953
01:41:29,722 --> 01:41:35,024
the DCP, then the cop at the
station and then the eunuch.

954
01:41:35,361 --> 01:41:39,298
Lets do it llla, come on!
-No Amudha! No...

955
01:41:39,298 --> 01:41:42,893
We are going to the States next week.!
THEY'LL know it's us.

956
01:41:43,936 --> 01:41:45,062
Then when?

957
01:41:45,772 --> 01:41:48,570
Lets get to the States first and
when we come back.

958
01:41:48,775 --> 01:41:49,571
we will kill all of them!

959
01:41:51,110 --> 01:41:55,069
llamaran held me back and
we left the country.

960
01:41:56,182 --> 01:41:57,581
After coming here we couldn't resist.

961
01:41:58,818 --> 01:42:02,914
We wanted to go on a spree,
a killing spree so to speak,

962
01:42:03,122 --> 01:42:03,918
So we did!

963
01:42:19,272 --> 01:42:20,864
l want to send a fingerto your boy friend.

964
01:42:21,174 --> 01:42:23,972
Yourfinger, what do you think?

965
01:42:30,917 --> 01:42:34,114
Chandana, this finger will be found
in Hitesh's cartomorrow.

966
01:42:38,491 --> 01:42:40,550
Take that, white bitch.

967
01:42:50,570 --> 01:42:52,162
Hey.. come here!

968
01:42:56,075 --> 01:42:59,203
l told you not to run right,
Ann. llla lets get started.

969
01:42:59,412 --> 01:43:02,210
We came back to lndia for a holiday 9 months ago.

970
01:43:02,548 --> 01:43:06,211
Never went home, went straight
to see Rani Arokiaraj.

971
01:43:07,353 --> 01:43:10,015
Rani! Hello Rani!

972
01:43:59,572 --> 01:44:00,596
Amudha, now what?

973
01:44:02,074 --> 01:44:03,200
Kill her and throw her body away !

974
01:44:03,409 --> 01:44:05,604
What did you think?
Can we send her home now?

975
01:44:05,978 --> 01:44:08,469
There is no change in
what we decided earlier.

976
01:44:08,881 --> 01:44:11,179
l want to bisect her and then bury her.

977
01:44:12,518 --> 01:44:14,884
Didn't you call me a 'useless idiot'?

978
01:44:15,087 --> 01:44:17,146
Now look at what's happened.
Remember Chandana?

979
01:44:17,356 --> 01:44:19,824
We'll do the same thing.

980
01:44:20,092 --> 01:44:24,552
cut herfinger and hang it in front of her house for
herfatherto get the shock of his life !

981
01:44:24,864 --> 01:44:25,694
then we'll kill him too.

982
01:44:28,935 --> 01:44:31,631
l hate you! l hate yourfather!

983
01:44:33,773 --> 01:44:38,107
l thought it a nice touch to hang Rani's finger
outside Arokiaraj's house.

984
01:44:39,312 --> 01:44:40,438
Before leaving the country,

985
01:44:40,646 --> 01:44:44,912
l wanted to kill Arokiaraj, the eunuch
and everyone at the station

986
01:44:46,052 --> 01:44:48,020
but just then you came in and
ruined the entire plan.

987
01:44:49,555 --> 01:44:51,523
You started digging the minute,

988
01:44:52,291 --> 01:44:53,656
you reached and we left everyone else for later,
and we came back here.

989
01:44:55,027 --> 01:44:59,589
Hello there! l was talking to you.

990
01:45:20,353 --> 01:45:22,617
When we got news that Arokiaraj was here

991
01:45:22,822 --> 01:45:24,983
we killed him the very next day.

992
01:45:26,158 --> 01:45:28,683
The only mistake l made
was you! you police dog,!

993
01:45:29,495 --> 01:45:31,087
And l hung the finger both here and there.

994
01:45:31,464 --> 01:45:32,431
Why?

995
01:45:33,599 --> 01:45:37,000
Seriously, you wouldn't have got us.

996
01:45:37,503 --> 01:45:40,563
This is a story that began many years ago,

997
01:45:41,374 --> 01:45:44,002
l pushed a classmate of mine
from a moving train when l was 13!

998
01:45:44,210 --> 01:45:49,307
Since then l've had this craving
forflesh and blood ...to kill people!

999
01:45:49,515 --> 01:45:50,777
Amudha! What are you doing here?

1000
01:45:50,983 --> 01:45:54,578
Just a minute Teacher. l have a doubt.

1001
01:45:54,787 --> 01:45:57,483
Why couldn't you ask me in class?

1002
01:45:58,958 --> 01:46:01,290
l heard you gave yourself to the Math Prof.

1003
01:46:01,494 --> 01:46:03,826
ls it only him... or ?

1004
01:46:04,030 --> 01:46:05,930
You idiot! What you are saying?

1005
01:46:06,132 --> 01:46:07,690
l thought you were such a nice...

1006
01:46:23,682 --> 01:46:25,843
Do you know what good doctors we are?

1007
01:46:26,419 --> 01:46:32,881
Seriously! Can you think of such a
combination - doctors plus killers.

1008
01:46:34,093 --> 01:46:39,190
Even now, if l want to l can save you. Should l ?

1009
01:46:40,966 --> 01:46:42,194
But you won't end it here, right?

1010
01:46:44,236 --> 01:46:47,137
Everything was fine until you showed up!

1011
01:46:47,339 --> 01:46:51,366
Now everybody will know we are
and it'll be difficult to move in public.

1012
01:46:52,344 --> 01:46:59,614
You should die! You should die...
right here, right now.

1013
01:47:06,092 --> 01:47:08,060
Take that! Fucker!

1014
01:47:12,264 --> 01:47:17,031
lla, Wake up! We need to leave right away.

1015
01:47:17,236 --> 01:47:20,728
Don't panic, it's just us.
Come on we need to leave. Fast!

1016
01:47:20,940 --> 01:47:21,463
You want the bag?

1017
01:47:21,674 --> 01:47:22,834
Where's my leather bag?

1018
01:47:23,042 --> 01:47:23,565
What do you need from it?

1019
01:47:23,776 --> 01:47:24,708
We don't need all tha t.
Just bring the bag.

1020
01:47:24,910 --> 01:47:26,309
Amudha, passports?
- l got them.

1021
01:47:29,281 --> 01:47:31,806
Amudha, lets kill him. -Ya.

1022
01:47:37,790 --> 01:47:40,759
Say a 'hi' to Arokiaraj from us!

1023
01:47:42,061 --> 01:47:42,993
Amudha, lets go.

1024
01:48:15,728 --> 01:48:17,628
New York Airport

1025
01:48:27,339 --> 01:48:31,742
Two hours afterthe fire was put out,
fire fighters found in a dumpster,

1026
01:48:31,877 --> 01:48:34,539
the body of an unidentified lndian male,

1027
01:48:34,647 --> 01:48:39,311
He is currently being treated for his wounds
at Caledonia and is in critical condition.

1028
01:49:09,548 --> 01:49:12,244
Amudha. We're in trouble.

1029
01:49:12,551 --> 01:49:13,210
l think they know about us.

1030
01:49:13,419 --> 01:49:14,784
Don't be so loud! There's someone inside!

1031
01:49:15,588 --> 01:49:17,180
All the cops have assembled here.

1032
01:49:17,423 --> 01:49:18,412
Fucking shit Amudha!

1033
01:49:19,458 --> 01:49:21,119
l think they must've got the information late.

1034
01:49:21,327 --> 01:49:23,192
Otherwise we would've been caught earlier.

1035
01:49:23,829 --> 01:49:24,853
We can still make it.

1036
01:49:26,765 --> 01:49:28,630
l got your bags. l'll wait at the door.

1037
01:49:28,834 --> 01:49:32,463
You'll join me soon...? Amudha...?

1038
01:49:49,054 --> 01:49:51,488
All ok?

1039
01:49:54,927 --> 01:49:55,859
Ya... Excuse me!

1040
01:50:26,125 --> 01:50:27,057
Ok! Now you are all set.

1041
01:50:30,896 --> 01:50:39,270
Hi. These guys are medical students from lndia,
Amudhan and lllamaran.

1042
01:50:39,471 --> 01:50:40,096
We know.

1043
01:50:40,306 --> 01:50:42,274
We got the information from
Anderson's computer

1044
01:50:42,474 --> 01:50:44,601
and from the owner of the flat
that went up in flames.

1045
01:50:45,911 --> 01:50:46,775
Did you get them?

1046
01:50:46,979 --> 01:50:49,607
No. They boarded a flight from JFK to Bombay.

1047
01:50:49,815 --> 01:50:53,182
We had officers stationed at the airport,
but they escaped into the city.

1048
01:50:53,819 --> 01:50:54,786
They got away.

1049
01:50:56,655 --> 01:50:58,020
Will keep you posted.

1050
01:50:58,257 --> 01:50:59,690
Alright. Thanks.

1051
01:51:03,729 --> 01:51:05,128
How did you get to know?

1052
01:51:06,498 --> 01:51:10,798
Tv. From last evening, all the channels
are covering your story.

1053
01:51:12,237 --> 01:51:13,568
l spoke to the doctor.

1054
01:51:14,473 --> 01:51:17,909
To start off, you've got a cut on your nose
and you are running temperature.

1055
01:51:18,277 --> 01:51:20,973
You've sprained your neck and many
parts of your body have been hurt,

1056
01:51:21,180 --> 01:51:23,080
with a knife which is 3 inches deep.

1057
01:51:23,449 --> 01:51:25,440
The doctor said it's a miracle that you are alive.

1058
01:51:25,651 --> 01:51:28,211
You have a lot of stitches like a C - Section.

1059
01:51:28,420 --> 01:51:29,717
Like you've just had a Caesarian .

1060
01:51:31,156 --> 01:51:34,990
You have a hair-line fracture too and it will take
atleast one week to remove the cast.

1061
01:51:36,161 --> 01:51:39,927
You need to rest for one week in bed,
in the hospital.

1062
01:51:40,265 --> 01:51:41,596
Thank you doctor!

1063
01:51:45,504 --> 01:51:50,840
l checked out your hotel room,
packed your bags, laptop etc.

1064
01:51:56,482 --> 01:52:03,081
l can't handle it! when l think someone has done
this to a girl and is living happily.

1065
01:52:06,825 --> 01:52:09,919
Passionate fire...

1066
01:52:13,399 --> 01:52:16,493
You mesmerized me...

1067
01:52:19,838 --> 01:52:23,365
He is not dead, right? Was he even
remotely burnt or not?

1068
01:52:23,842 --> 01:52:24,934
l am not sure.

1069
01:52:25,444 --> 01:52:27,537
The news only says he is injured
and is in the hospital.

And l came back to life because
you came in my dreams

1081
01:54:12,384 --> 01:54:16,582
Come in the form of rain
and fall all over me,

1082
01:54:16,788 --> 01:54:20,918
Come in the form of the sun
and stay as the sweat in my body

1083
01:54:21,126 --> 01:54:26,325
Come in the form of snow
and rest on my bed

1084
01:54:26,632 --> 01:54:34,061
And the smile is born on my lips...
and l thought it was something new!

1085
01:54:34,273 --> 01:54:38,539
l will do the fomentation comfortably
with the passionate fire.

1086
01:54:38,744 --> 01:54:42,612
And l would mesmerize you and

My love! You are like the bells
found in a chariot!

1091
01:55:36,101 --> 01:55:40,401
Oh beauty... are you interested
in sharing a night with me?

1092
01:55:40,606 --> 01:55:45,805
And let my tongue hold only
your long lasting taste...

1093
01:55:46,011 --> 01:55:50,107
Let the fingers bind together!

1094
01:55:50,315 --> 01:55:53,546

Team ForCe

1102
01:56:59,184 --> 01:57:01,152
Are you sure you have to
leave today Mr Raghavan?

1103
01:57:01,687 --> 01:57:04,815
The doctor suggests that you need to
rest for 3 more days atleast.

1104
01:57:05,023 --> 01:57:05,489
Hi

1105
01:57:05,691 --> 01:57:06,487
My friend Sapna.

1106
01:57:07,359 --> 01:57:10,157
You can stay at her place till you get
better and then leave.

1107
01:57:10,362 --> 01:57:11,659
Thanks. l would really appreciate that

1108
01:57:11,863 --> 01:57:12,830
But l have lots to do back home.

1109
01:57:13,031 --> 01:57:15,158
l would need a week to settle down.

1110
01:57:15,367 --> 01:57:16,732
l'm really alright!

1111
01:57:19,371 --> 01:57:20,668
l'll come along with you.

1112
01:57:21,606 --> 01:57:22,664
Where to? The Airport right? Sure.

1113
01:57:22,874 --> 01:57:23,499
Chennai.

1114
01:57:28,380 --> 01:57:30,348
Don't be silly. l'm alright.

1115
01:57:30,549 --> 01:57:32,517
Oh it's not because of you !
l really have work in Chennai.

1116
01:57:32,718 --> 01:57:34,083
My mother will be coming back with me.

1117
01:57:34,286 --> 01:57:35,014
So, l have to go.

1118
01:57:35,220 --> 01:57:36,619
l don't want herto travel alone.

1119
01:57:37,989 --> 01:57:40,685
Seriously if you hadn't left today
l wouldn't have too!

1120
01:57:40,892 --> 01:57:42,189
You see l was planning to leave with you.

1121
01:57:42,394 --> 01:57:43,691
Might as well travel together.

1122
01:57:48,433 --> 01:57:50,367
Tickets and bags are in the car.

1123
01:58:27,439 --> 01:58:31,739
So, you've decided to settle in New York ?

1124
01:58:32,277 --> 01:58:34,404
l really don't know.
not yet decided.

1125
01:58:35,013 --> 01:58:37,413
l have to come back and
start work.That's about it.

1126
01:58:38,016 --> 01:58:40,746
l am not sure if l would settle in NY
or go elsewhere.

1127
01:59:33,572 --> 01:59:37,474
lf Arun comes back would you accept him?

1128
01:59:38,510 --> 01:59:44,142
No... definitely not and l mean it.

1129
01:59:49,754 --> 02:00:00,323
He didn't just throw me away,
but also my daughter

1130
02:00:03,702 --> 02:00:04,327
Maya.

1131
02:00:06,438 --> 02:00:12,343
She is 11 months old.
She means the world to me.

1132
02:00:17,716 --> 02:00:21,846
l could forgive him for everything else
but not this.

1133
02:00:24,789 --> 02:00:27,849
He abandoned a 5 month old baby?

1134
02:00:31,963 --> 02:00:32,429
Yes.

1135
02:00:36,067 --> 02:00:39,798
Ok...but how could you attempt suicide,
leaving behind a 11 month old baby?

1136
02:00:44,576 --> 02:00:46,874
l regret even trying,

1137
02:00:48,914 --> 02:00:53,146
Sorry l couldn't talk to you about Maya earlier,

1138
02:00:53,985 --> 02:00:55,714
l knew you would ask me this question,

1139
02:00:58,256 --> 02:01:00,053
lf l had, and l wouldn't have been able
to give you an answer.

1140
02:01:03,929 --> 02:01:12,064
l still don't know what to say.

1141
02:01:12,270 --> 02:01:15,171
Maya lives with my parents in Chennai.

1142
02:01:16,107 --> 02:01:19,235
lt's been two weeks since l left herthere.

1143
02:01:21,846 --> 02:01:24,076
Thought l would take her back
afterfinding a job.

1144
02:01:24,549 --> 02:01:25,743
That's why l'm going to Chennai.

1145
02:01:50,642 --> 02:01:56,376
Aradhna, when do you plan to come back here?

1146
02:01:56,581 --> 02:01:58,173
ln a weeks time, next Sunday may be.

1147
02:02:00,151 --> 02:02:01,015
Do you really have to ?

1148
02:02:04,656 --> 02:02:06,783
Yes. Why?

1149
02:02:10,161 --> 02:02:11,958
What if l said l like you?

1150
02:02:21,006 --> 02:02:22,803
You want to run away huh?

1151
02:02:24,242 --> 02:02:25,300
this very minute! Well,
that's tough.. there's a queue...

1152
02:02:29,247 --> 02:02:32,307
Seriously l have fallen in love with you.

1153
02:02:36,521 --> 02:02:40,480
l don't think this is the best
place to say. But still...

1154
02:02:41,092 --> 02:02:43,822
But once we're out of this gate,

1155
02:02:44,029 --> 02:02:45,326
you and me go our separate
ways and l'm not sure

1156
02:02:45,530 --> 02:02:47,157
lf l'll have the chance to tell you this again,

1157
02:02:47,766 --> 02:02:48,460
Next please.

1158
02:03:12,891 --> 02:03:13,357
Sir?

1159
02:03:14,793 --> 02:03:15,521
Thanks

1160
02:03:25,870 --> 02:03:27,531
What did you see in my 'eyes'?

1161
02:03:28,406 --> 02:03:39,544
Like Kayalvizhi, but this time
what did you find in me?

1162
02:03:41,753 --> 02:03:44,881
l didn't pay attention to such things this time.

1163
02:03:45,590 --> 02:03:48,559
ln the last 12 days, l could feel
something change in me.

1164
02:03:50,095 --> 02:03:52,222
Just thought l'd tell you...

1165
02:04:09,280 --> 02:04:14,149
When Kayal died, she was 5 months pregnant.

1166
02:04:17,021 --> 02:04:18,818
Maya will be the child l lost.

1167
02:04:21,192 --> 02:04:24,525
She will be like my daughter,
my own little girl.

1168
02:04:26,865 --> 02:04:28,594
l assure you l will be a good father,

1169
02:04:31,236 --> 02:04:37,197
Maya will be 'our' daughter. Allright?

1170
02:04:42,313 --> 02:04:42,779
Shit!

1171
02:04:46,985 --> 02:04:53,117
l cry very easily nowadays.

1172
02:04:57,228 --> 02:04:57,887
For me...

1173
02:04:57,996 --> 02:05:00,123
l'm not ready for another relationship as yet.

1174
02:05:03,668 --> 02:05:06,398
l have a lot to consider.

1175
02:05:07,772 --> 02:05:12,402
l don't know if l'm ready to make
the right decisions yet.

1176
02:05:15,513 --> 02:05:18,175
l won't be able to handle it if 10 years down
the line Maya tells me l made the wrong choices.

1177
02:05:21,352 --> 02:05:25,812
l don't want to think of anything now.

1178
02:05:26,157 --> 02:05:27,818
There is nothing that you don't know.

1179
02:05:28,526 --> 02:05:31,654
But you don't understand that some things
are better left unsaid.

1180
02:05:43,141 --> 02:05:44,108
Your bag...

1181
02:06:07,799 --> 02:06:25,639
You dropped a spark of fire in my life
which broke into my emotions like an atom.

1182
02:06:25,883 --> 02:06:34,552
Why are you moving away from me and
making it seem like a mirage?

1183
02:06:35,059 --> 02:06:44,058
l'm not going to take back
the heart l gave you.

1184
02:06:44,269 --> 02:07:02,143
You dropped a spark of fire in my life
which broke my emotions like an atom.

Team ForCe

1186
02:07:25,543 --> 02:07:29,479
You are close, yet far...

1187
02:07:30,014 --> 02:07:34,007
You are the sky
the waves and sea tries to reach...

1188
02:07:34,452 --> 02:07:40,880
Are two hearts not enough to fall in love?

1189
02:07:41,092 --> 02:07:43,492
You tell me...

1190
02:07:43,695 --> 02:07:47,631
This is indeed the second time for us,

1191
02:07:48,032 --> 02:07:52,128
But can't it happen, you tell me?

1192
02:07:52,337 --> 02:07:56,603
Do you think this would work?

1193
02:07:56,808 --> 02:08:01,245
Can two poles come together?

1194
02:08:01,446 --> 02:08:05,815
You moved away after saying it,

1195
02:08:06,017 --> 02:08:10,317
And l kept worrying thinking about it!

1196
02:08:10,555 --> 02:08:14,651
How am l going to handle this?

1197
02:08:15,793 --> 02:08:33,701
You dropped a spark of fire in my life
which broke into my emotions like an atom.

1199
02:09:12,817 --> 02:09:17,186
Something seems to be stopping me,

1200
02:09:17,455 --> 02:09:22,017
And keeps telling me l am a woman...

1201
02:09:22,226 --> 02:09:31,100
Neither have the wounds in me
healed or disappeared

1202
02:09:31,302 --> 02:09:39,732
Even when you brought your hands
to comfort me, l declined.

1203
02:09:39,944 --> 02:09:48,852
Come and be mine,
and lose yourself on my shoulder...

1204
02:09:49,120 --> 02:09:53,284
l've said whatever has to be told

1205
02:09:53,491 --> 02:10:00,761
And now l will wait foryou as long as ever,
ln the direction you would come.

02:10:28,426 --> 02:10:37,960
l'm not going to take back
the heart l gave you.

1209
02:11:23,781 --> 02:11:26,682
At ease. Sit down please.

1210
02:11:30,555 --> 02:11:32,682
The guys who misbehaved with Rani Arokiaraj,

1211
02:11:32,890 --> 02:11:39,853
were arrested and detained at
Sathanur police station about 2 years back.

1212
02:11:40,064 --> 02:11:44,933
lnspector Kumaravel, you committed
a big mistake that night,

1213
02:11:45,503 --> 02:11:49,098
plus you did not collect
any information about them.

1214
02:11:50,241 --> 02:11:51,037
Sit down.

1215
02:11:51,576 --> 02:11:53,373
We could've caught them
when Rani was murdered,

1216
02:11:53,911 --> 02:11:56,641
But when l asked you,
you had absolutely no details about them,

1217
02:11:57,081 --> 02:12:01,211
You called them 'good for
nothing boys', from Madras.

1218
02:12:02,753 --> 02:12:03,549
What kind of a cop are you,

1219
02:12:03,754 --> 02:12:07,053
lf you have no intuitive insight
into the character of a criminal?

1220
02:12:08,259 --> 02:12:11,387
That's bad police work and
here is a bad policeman.

1221
02:12:11,596 --> 02:12:14,963
Sir, the other day...-Sit down.

1222
02:12:16,434 --> 02:12:20,165
The unnecessary illtreatment they
got that night, instigated their rampage.

1223
02:12:20,938 --> 02:12:22,166
Do you know what that means?

1224
02:12:23,774 --> 02:12:25,241
You are also responsible
for Arokiaraj's murder!

1225
02:12:25,443 --> 02:12:26,740
The only consolation foryou is,

1226
02:12:27,111 --> 02:12:28,738
You are responsible only for his murder,

1227
02:12:29,280 --> 02:12:31,646
because they had already committed,

1228
02:12:32,116 --> 02:12:35,085
15 murders including Rani Arokiaraj,

1229
02:12:35,720 --> 02:12:39,588
and if we were to include Anderson,
Chitra and Mr Arokiaraj, the death count is 18.

1230
02:12:40,291 --> 02:12:41,918
We need to find them very soon

1231
02:12:42,293 --> 02:12:45,421
and 10 of you from this lot
will leave to Bombay immediately.

1232
02:12:45,630 --> 02:12:48,428
Place new check posts in all
the districts in Tamil Nadu

1233
02:12:48,633 --> 02:12:52,262
and have a clear watch at
Amudhan's house in his village.

1234
02:12:52,637 --> 02:12:56,937
We have a psychopath serial killer duo
on the run and we have to stop them.

1235
02:12:58,676 --> 02:13:00,109
l spent about half an hour with them,

1236
02:13:00,311 --> 02:13:03,542
and if my thinking is correct they
won't be able to hide fortoo long.

1237
02:13:04,548 --> 02:13:06,448
lf we poke them at the right place
they will surely come out in the open,

1238
02:13:06,651 --> 02:13:07,447
and target me.

1239
02:13:07,818 --> 02:13:08,944
l have a plan...

1240
02:13:09,320 --> 02:13:10,446
Both of them are very young.

1241
02:13:10,821 --> 02:13:12,448
They might have been involved
in serious accident

1242
02:13:12,823 --> 02:13:15,291
when they were 8 or 9 perhaps
that altered their minds.

1243
02:13:16,327 --> 02:13:20,127
They both share same ideology,
they have turned into killers.

1244
02:13:20,331 --> 02:13:22,299
We have launched a Statewide hunt forthem.

1245
02:13:22,833 --> 02:13:25,461
against the Nation Wide
alert that already exists.

1246
02:13:26,337 --> 02:13:28,464
They can't stay under coverfortoo long.

1247
02:13:28,839 --> 02:13:31,307
To put it literally ''They're finished!''

1248
02:13:33,678 --> 02:13:35,976
and to say it in our words
''We'll get them soon.''

1249
02:13:36,180 --> 02:13:38,808
Police are inquiring Amudhan's parents.

1250
02:13:39,083 --> 02:13:41,483
Dean of the medical college
they had studied says...

1251
02:13:41,686 --> 02:13:46,316
Doctors exist to protect
and save lives, not to kill.

1252
02:13:46,524 --> 02:13:51,325
The Medical Council of lndia has declared
that Amudhan and llamaran

1253
02:13:51,595 --> 02:13:52,653
cannot continue to practice as doctors
and as decreed by our university,

1254
02:13:53,030 --> 02:13:55,328
l hereby cancel both their degrees.

1255
02:13:55,533 --> 02:13:56,500
So what if they cancel my degree?

1256
02:13:57,368 --> 02:13:58,335
Does that mean l'm not a doctor?

1257
02:14:00,037 --> 02:14:02,267
Can they do anything to remove the
love for medicine inside me?

1258
02:14:03,374 --> 02:14:07,174
You fucker Dean, when l
got the University Rank,

1259
02:14:07,545 --> 02:14:11,072
l was splashed all overthe newspapers,
the entire college celebrated!

1260
02:14:12,783 --> 02:14:17,015
After so many years l brought
glory to the College.

1261
02:14:17,521 --> 02:14:23,255
l'm a Doctor !... l'm a Surgeon...
l'm the best in the world.!

1262
02:14:23,661 --> 02:14:26,687
lla can anyone match the D&A Research l did?

1263
02:14:26,897 --> 02:14:29,695
2 years of hard work in medicine...
lets kill them all lla!

1264
02:14:33,738 --> 02:14:35,365
Do you have to take all this?

1265
02:14:47,918 --> 02:14:49,215
what's wrong?

1266
02:14:50,855 --> 02:14:51,549
Nothing.

1267
02:14:57,161 --> 02:15:00,062
Hey, wasn't she with you at the airport?

1268
02:15:01,031 --> 02:15:04,398
l think you should give up your
interior designing job,

1269
02:15:04,668 --> 02:15:07,136
and join our department as a detective.

1270
02:15:08,105 --> 02:15:10,903
Yes, it's her-Aradhna ok?

1271
02:15:11,275 --> 02:15:16,076
Oh! So apart from 'murder investigation in' NY,
there was romance too?

1272
02:15:16,280 --> 02:15:19,181
Look, no romance!

1273
02:15:21,051 --> 02:15:26,182
We just got to know each other and
spent some quality time together.

1274
02:15:26,390 --> 02:15:28,756
Yourfather is very unhappy
about you leaving.

1275
02:15:29,960 --> 02:15:33,418
He wants you to cancel the ticket
but you insist on endorsing it.

1276
02:15:33,731 --> 02:15:34,823
Mom, please....

1277
02:15:44,175 --> 02:15:47,303
Ya, one second, Aradhna, call foryou,

1278
02:15:52,817 --> 02:15:53,283
Hello?

1279
02:16:06,330 --> 02:16:10,460
Look, she was married, but now separated.

1280
02:16:10,668 --> 02:16:13,102
She has a 11 month old baby.

1281
02:16:15,840 --> 02:16:17,967
Arun, one second!

1282
02:16:19,677 --> 02:16:22,077
Don't you want
to know how Maya is?

1283
02:16:23,247 --> 02:16:26,307
you haven't even said one word about her.
You couldn't care less right?

1284
02:16:31,188 --> 02:16:34,419
She will be my daughter, my only daughter.

1285
02:16:36,794 --> 02:16:39,558
She's a warm person, very beautiful.

1286
02:16:40,464 --> 02:16:45,492
She would hardly talk about her problems.
She didn't like it when she cried.

1287
02:16:45,703 --> 02:16:48,103
Enough! Just bring her home.
She's very beautiful.

1288
02:16:49,206 --> 02:16:55,338
Like l don't know! l proposed to her,
but she said No.

1289
02:16:57,381 --> 02:17:01,511
But... that's not the end of the story.

1290
02:17:05,389 --> 02:17:06,856
This bus is going to Mangalore.

1291
02:17:07,558 --> 02:17:08,855
Stop the bus.

1292
02:17:09,059 --> 02:17:10,526
Switch on the lights.- Okay sir.

1293
02:17:10,728 --> 02:17:14,687
We are searching fortwo men,
how many passengers are in the bus?- 62

1294
02:17:16,333 --> 02:17:17,197
Did you stop the bus anywhere enroute?

1295
02:17:17,401 --> 02:17:18,527
No, l didn't stop anywhere.

1296
02:17:31,248 --> 02:17:34,547
Ya, Raghavan. No it's ok. Tell me.

1297
02:17:44,428 --> 02:17:45,452
They had a gun?

1298
02:17:46,430 --> 02:17:51,732
Bombay, Goa, Mangalore, Kozhikode.

1299
02:17:51,936 --> 02:17:53,563
Ask them to run a proper check at Kozhikode.

1300
02:17:53,938 --> 02:17:57,066
Coimbatore... Salem... Right.

1301
02:17:57,274 --> 02:18:02,234
Now ask the Goa team to be more vigilant.

1302
02:18:02,446 --> 02:18:03,913
Has the Coimbatore SP been informed?

1303
02:18:04,114 --> 02:18:06,412
Have their posters been stuck at all
National Highways and small streets?

1304
02:18:06,617 --> 02:18:08,414
Ok... good... get on with it.

1305
02:18:08,619 --> 02:18:09,415
Amudha, what do you think you are doing?

1306
02:18:09,620 --> 02:18:10,416
We need to get out of here.

1307
02:18:11,956 --> 02:18:14,083
We can't keep hiding,

1308
02:18:20,097 --> 02:18:21,962
We can't run anymore. Do you understand?

1309
02:18:22,800 --> 02:18:23,425
Okay.

1310
02:18:23,634 --> 02:18:25,101
l guess it is supposed to end this way.

1311
02:18:25,803 --> 02:18:28,101
But if we are caught, we should down in
should be in a blaze of glory!

1312
02:18:28,906 --> 02:18:30,999
unmatched forthe next 50 years!
That should be the impact!

1313
02:18:32,476 --> 02:18:34,603
What did he call us - 'good for nothing'?

1314
02:18:36,981 --> 02:18:38,505
We need to show him our power!

1315
02:18:39,149 --> 02:18:41,447
What did he call us - 'good for nothing'?
You fucker...

1316
02:18:46,323 --> 02:18:47,950
'state wide' search huh?

1317
02:18:48,993 --> 02:18:50,119
l'm coming foryou!

1318
02:18:50,995 --> 02:18:54,123
Thoroughly check all the entry
points from Kerala to Chennai.

1319
02:18:54,331 --> 02:18:56,299
l want you to intensify search.

1320
02:18:57,601 --> 02:19:00,968
Chengalpet, Poondamalle...and send about
10 people to check the day trains.

1321
02:19:02,406 --> 02:19:03,566
One minute,

1322
02:19:05,776 --> 02:19:11,146
Can you find out the arrival time of the
flight from Calicut to Chennai?

1323
02:19:11,348 --> 02:19:14,146
What? 11?

1324
02:19:14,852 --> 02:19:16,877
That's in another 5 minutes.
Thank you.

1325
02:19:50,754 --> 02:19:52,688
l asked you to hold everyone,
-l couldn't hold everyone Sir.

1326
02:19:52,890 --> 02:19:54,687
Sir, it was too late when you called.

1327
02:19:54,892 --> 02:19:56,416
The flight had already landed and the
passengers had already started to move out.

1328
02:19:56,727 --> 02:19:57,523
What do you think?
Are you joking?

1329
02:19:57,728 --> 02:19:59,025
Do you know how serious this is?

1330
02:19:59,229 --> 02:20:01,857
Here, take this list and check
every passenger now.

1331
02:20:33,697 --> 02:20:34,561
Go to the Poondamalle check post.

1332
02:20:41,271 --> 02:20:44,069
Ok lla, 'Operation Raghavan' begins.

1333
02:20:59,456 --> 02:21:00,423
Hello, Raghavan!

1334
02:21:00,791 --> 02:21:01,758
Aradhana here.

1335
02:21:02,626 --> 02:21:04,355
Oh, Aradhana, how are you?

1336
02:21:05,129 --> 02:21:05,925
l don't know.

1337
02:21:06,530 --> 02:21:07,428
My mind is in a whirl.

1338
02:21:07,898 --> 02:21:10,093
l don't know what's happening to me.

1339
02:21:10,534 --> 02:21:15,836
l know you are busy, but is it possible
foryou to meet me in an hour?

1340
02:21:19,409 --> 02:21:20,433
Now ? where exactly are you?

1341
02:21:43,500 --> 02:21:43,966
Busy?

1342
02:21:45,836 --> 02:21:47,463
Sought of. Still with the same case.

1343
02:21:51,642 --> 02:21:53,041
What is it Aradhana, tell me?

1344
02:21:55,679 --> 02:21:58,978
Help. Restless.

1345
02:22:00,184 --> 02:22:01,981
You said you like me and left the place.

1346
02:22:03,687 --> 02:22:05,814
l'm leaving in 2 days.

1347
02:22:07,524 --> 02:22:09,151
l don't know what's been happening to me!

1348
02:22:10,360 --> 02:22:13,818
l'm on my way to the airport to
endorse my ticket.

1349
02:22:17,301 --> 02:22:24,571
Beautiful New York, a good job,
an awesome life...

1350
02:22:27,811 --> 02:22:31,008
but l'm in no mind to leave.

1351
02:22:32,482 --> 02:22:36,009
l want to stay here...Because of you.

1352
02:22:38,222 --> 02:22:39,519
l'm not sure if things would turn out right,

1353
02:22:42,392 --> 02:22:53,360
l don't know it's not easy ...
l'm confused... help!

1354
02:22:58,075 --> 02:22:59,042
l'll tell you what.

1355
02:23:02,412 --> 02:23:08,214
l didn't think twice before saying it

1356
02:23:09,253 --> 02:23:12,711
and it's not even been a year since
you were separated from your husband.

1357
02:23:13,257 --> 02:23:16,954
Mentally, you should feel ok, and
ourfamilies should be convinced.

1358
02:23:18,795 --> 02:23:22,822
l didn't think about all this but now
l realize it's not that easy.

1359
02:23:23,500 --> 02:23:27,231
Why don't you leave, very soon - New York,

1360
02:23:27,971 --> 02:23:32,738
a new beginning, feel better,
sought out your issues

1361
02:23:33,210 --> 02:23:37,408
and some day if you think you
like me, give me call.

1362
02:23:37,614 --> 02:23:44,076
Yes, l do! l admit it... l do like you!

1363
02:23:56,466 --> 02:24:00,926
Good. So, go to the airport,
cancel yourticket,

1364
02:24:01,138 --> 02:24:05,268
you don't need to go. Alright?

1365
02:24:07,244 --> 02:24:13,342
We'll talk with ourfamilies.
We'll wait. Ok?

1366
02:24:23,493 --> 02:24:28,123
But from this minute, Maya and
you are my responsibility.

1367
02:24:28,365 --> 02:24:35,168
The silver sparkling moon
keeps following me wherever!

1368
02:24:35,972 --> 02:24:43,469
The silver sparkling moon brought along
all the stars in the sky!

1369
02:25:00,530 --> 02:25:02,327
Bloody shit.. this is irritating me.

1370
02:25:08,038 --> 02:25:09,164
Amudha, she's leaving!

1371
02:25:13,377 --> 02:25:15,004
You follow her. l'll take care of him.

1372
02:25:15,212 --> 02:25:17,009
l'll call you lla. We'll meet in the usual place.

1373
02:25:17,214 --> 02:25:17,680
OK.

1374
02:25:26,390 --> 02:25:28,017
Come on, get going lla, she's leaving.

1375
02:26:07,164 --> 02:26:10,065
Mom, l'm on my way to cancel my ticket.

1376
02:26:10,500 --> 02:26:11,398
l've decided not to go.

1377
02:26:13,303 --> 02:26:14,235
Are you happy now?

1378
02:26:15,372 --> 02:26:16,396
Please tell dad!

1379
02:28:10,387 --> 02:28:11,285
Who is the girl, man?

1380
02:28:11,721 --> 02:28:12,688
l couldn't find out properly.

1381
02:28:14,224 --> 02:28:15,088
Where does she stay?

1382
02:28:15,659 --> 02:28:18,787
Adyar. But she's really hot !

1383
02:28:20,130 --> 02:28:22,530
Even if they don't have anything
to do with each other,

1384
02:28:23,066 --> 02:28:24,033
l don't care, l want her!

1385
02:28:24,234 --> 02:28:25,701
'nothing to do with each other'

1386
02:28:26,069 --> 02:28:27,036
why would they be walking on
the road holding hands?

1387
02:28:28,405 --> 02:28:30,532
Are you sure this place is safe?

1388
02:28:30,740 --> 02:28:33,368
Yes. There's no other place
like this inside the city.

1389
02:29:21,524 --> 02:29:22,491
Raghavan here.

1390
02:29:57,661 --> 02:29:59,629
What are you all waiting for?

1391
02:30:00,030 --> 02:30:01,554
lnform the fire department
and get this removed.

1392
02:30:01,765 --> 02:30:04,632
What is the press doing here?
Get out of here... out...

1393
02:31:07,564 --> 02:31:10,362
Tell me Aradhana.
-Hey, just go to sleep.

1394
02:31:10,567 --> 02:31:11,693
lt's 4 :30 in the morning.

1395
02:31:12,001 --> 02:31:14,026
Maya will wake up any minute.

1396
02:31:14,237 --> 02:31:16,034
No. What did you tell him?

1397
02:31:16,806 --> 02:31:18,706
l want to know what you
guys told each other.

1398
02:31:21,411 --> 02:31:24,869
'So don't go. Cancel yourticket.'

1399
02:31:25,682 --> 02:31:28,378
'Maya and you are my responsibility now'.

1400
02:31:29,085 --> 02:31:34,045
Oh wow! lt sounds a little
cliched but it's nice.

1401
02:31:34,257 --> 02:31:36,384
Then what else did Raghavan say?

1402
02:31:36,593 --> 02:31:38,060
You left at 10 and returned only at 1.

1403
02:31:38,261 --> 02:31:39,728
l can't talk anymore!

1404
02:31:41,464 --> 02:31:42,658
Will you
please go to sleep?

1405
02:31:43,032 --> 02:31:45,057
Pest! Worse than my daughter.

1406
02:31:47,704 --> 02:31:52,732
Hello Ladies. Don't scream.

1407
02:31:52,942 --> 02:31:54,910
Where the hell are you going?

1408
02:31:57,781 --> 02:32:01,239
Don't scream... Oh wow! You're so hot...

1409
02:32:01,451 --> 02:32:02,076
Can ljust eat you up ?

1410
02:32:04,120 --> 02:32:05,087
Leave her alone!

1411
02:32:15,298 --> 02:32:16,424
Just answerthis,

1412
02:32:17,467 --> 02:32:19,594
lf l take you away you will Raghavan
come looking foryou or not?

1413
02:32:23,306 --> 02:32:26,434
Will he come as a cop, or will he come
as man following his heart ?

1414
02:32:26,876 --> 02:32:31,779
Tell me!... Oh! we have a baby here.

1415
02:32:32,315 --> 02:32:33,612
Will he come if l take the baby?

1416
02:32:35,418 --> 02:32:40,117
l hate babies! but it's ok ! if l this
what it takes to get Raghavan!

1417
02:32:41,391 --> 02:32:43,951
No. Leave my child alone!

1418
02:32:44,828 --> 02:32:47,194
OK, then get to the car waiting outside.

1419
02:32:48,898 --> 02:32:50,798
Archana? Archana?

1420
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:51,796
Mom?

02:32:52,335 --> 02:32:53,461
Not a word about this...

1422
02:32:56,840 --> 02:33:00,207
Have you both gone crazy?

1423
02:33:03,012 --> 02:33:04,639
Out of the four of you, who is disposable?

1424
02:33:04,981 --> 02:33:06,312
The old lady? Shall l kill her?

1425
02:33:06,683 --> 02:33:10,483
Let go of her. Please. Let go of her.

1426
02:33:23,466 --> 02:33:24,763
Get the rope down.

You take care of this,
l'll make a move.

1435
02:33:54,230 --> 02:33:57,358

the other side of the fly over

1445
02:35:00,396 --> 02:35:02,660
Amudha, l was able to kill only the security.

1446
02:35:03,299 --> 02:35:03,765
l couldn't enterthe place.

1447
02:35:03,967 --> 02:35:05,594
A group of cops landed up,
totally unexpected !.-Fucking shit.

1453
02:35:27,991 --> 02:35:33,122
but he's killed the sentry
and has written '3' on this shirt.

Times are different l think there's too
much time left, it's difficult time.

02:41:36,359 --> 02:41:37,656
You are too hot.

Raghavan!...

1485
02:42:19,335 --> 02:42:20,632
What does he want?

1486
02:42:22,004 --> 02:42:24,529
Raghavan l'm busy, l'll call you later ok?

let me tell you something that
only you might know.

1497
02:42:56,439 --> 02:43:00,239
He has your name tattooed on his
back with a heart drawn under it.

1498
02:43:02,611 --> 02:43:04,476
Are you guys homosexuals?

1499
02:43:06,782 --> 02:43:09,250
Ok, forget it, just tell me where to come.

1500

lt will just be me and your 'girlfriend'!

1501

1505
02:44:35,371 --> 02:44:36,838
Where is the rest of your posse?

1506
02:44:37,039 --> 02:44:38,165
Call everybody out and
ask them to kill me!

1507
02:44:38,574 --> 02:44:41,099
But even afterthat you still
won't be able to find your girlfriend!

1508
02:44:43,212 --> 02:44:45,339
You went to everywhere digging
up the 'remains' right?

No... it's just me! And him...

1511
02:44:56,892 --> 02:44:59,861
You bastard...if you have issues
with me, deal straight with me...

1512
02:45:00,729 --> 02:45:01,787
