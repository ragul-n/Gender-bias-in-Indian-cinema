couldn't feel like a dog or

something that isn't

- I'm doing all the work here man.

- Push! Push! Come on!
- Jason it stepped on my foot.

18
00:03:25,175 --> 00:03:26,175
Pull yourself together.

19
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:29,474
Yo, just tight the pinch and
let's get out of here.

20
00:03:29,662 --> 00:03:31,062
The cow seems unhappy.

21
00:03:31,262 --> 00:03:33,222
I should not be unhappy because
I just milked her.

22
00:03:33,884 --> 00:03:36,035
Him. You just milked him.

23
00:03:36,225 --> 00:03:38,249
- This is a him?
- Was it one udder?

24
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,094
- Yeah.
- That's not an udder dude.

25
00:03:40,331 --> 00:03:42,232
I was gonna say it was
actually kind off.. it was big.

26
00:03:42,421 --> 00:03:43,421
I had to use two hands...

27
00:03:43,454 --> 00:03:45,111
Stop. We will never
discuss this again.

28

you didn't rat out your friends

You're freak, you know that?

72
00:07:31,156 --> 00:07:34,056
I have had to watch you play
with these for weeks. Are you crazy?

00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:35,291
No.

74
00:07:35,362 --> 00:07:36,708
What if you had an extra one?

75
00:07:38,349 --> 00:07:40,170
Why don't you cut this
and do something?

76
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,360
Why do not you stop me?

77
00:07:41,645 --> 00:07:42,845
- Huh, you gonna stop..?
- Hey!

78
00:07:44,231 --> 00:07:46,066

It's my first time here.

00:07:49,726 --> 00:07:50,767
It's exciting!

81
00:07:51,047 --> 00:07:54,766
You must be the bully of detention.
How dumb can you be?

82
00:08:01,819 --> 00:08:02,982
Did you just slap me?

83
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:05,238
I did. Weird, right?

84
00:08:06,197 --> 00:08:08,769
Now I'm gonna be here every day for
what seems like the rest of my life

85
00:08:08,962 --> 00:08:11,839
and I'm sure that you are too.
So let's make a deal.

86
00:08:12,162 --> 00:08:14,808
Don't sit near me or him.

87
00:08:15,823 --> 00:08:17,428
Then we'll be okay.

88
00:08:22,659 --> 00:08:27,301
Okay. I approved homework
or being under better choices...

89
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,160
- work with it. This will be...
- I need to go to the ladies room.

90
00:08:31,266 --> 00:08:32,910
Okay. And Good Morning.

91
00:08:39,664 --> 00:08:40,664
Oh my God!

92
00:08:41,495 --> 00:08:43,663
I got your text and I was like,
"Where are they?"

93
00:08:43,863 --> 00:08:47,019
So this is where you come every
Saturday instead of practice.

94
00:08:47,566 --> 00:08:49,448
- It must suck.
- It does.

95
00:08:49,741 --> 00:08:50,924
Well, then you shouldn't have sent,

96
00:08:50,994 --> 00:08:51,915
Try that picture of me.

97
00:08:52,038 --> 00:08:54,380
That's not exactly how it happened,
I mean he is a liar.

98
00:08:54,668 --> 00:08:57,327
- You punched his tooth out.
- They put it back.

99
00:08:57,534 --> 00:08:59,492

100
00:08:59,701 --> 00:09:00,835

00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,009

103
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,024

104
00:09:10,337 --> 00:09:13,388
You can chill for cheer practice
if you want, but I wouldn't.

105
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:56,545
God damn!

106
00:10:14,424 --> 00:10:16,152
Oh my God! What have you done?

107
00:10:16,352 --> 00:10:17,372
Kimberly what have
you done with your hair.

108
00:10:17,442 --> 00:10:18,114
You cut off your hair?

109
00:10:18,314 --> 00:10:19,314
Whoa, Look!

110
00:10:20,525 --> 00:10:21,033
The door!

111
00:10:21,443 --> 00:10:22,959
Hey thanks for that in there.

112
00:10:23,506 --> 00:10:25,747
No worries, I hate guys like that.

113
00:10:25,806 --> 00:10:26,632
Yeah.

114
00:10:26,686 --> 00:10:29,208
Oh so, hey, we should
hang out sometime huh?

115
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,923
Not that we had to,
I think tonight we should.

116
00:10:32,417 --> 00:10:33,942
- What's your name again?
- Billy.

117
00:10:34,408 --> 00:10:35,616
Billy Cranston.

118
00:10:35,985 --> 00:10:37,343
Or William Cranston.

119
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:39,471
Remember Cage use to call me
"Billie Cramp stones".

120
00:10:39,775 --> 00:10:42,298
As a third grade joke like Billy
Cramp stone is a crayon in his butt.

121
00:10:42,496 --> 00:10:46,397
Which I didn't. But it is really impossible
to cram a ton of crayons in your butt.

122
00:10:46,657 --> 00:10:48,953
- No, no, I'm sorry... Okay Billy.
- I would honestly hang out with you

123
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:52,669
but I have a date every night with
the Angel Grove Sherriff's department.

124
00:10:53,334 --> 00:10:53,954
So, I am sorry.

125
00:10:54,024 --> 00:10:55,965
Wait! No, no, no.
Don't leave, don't leave.

126
00:10:56,134 --> 00:10:59,115
Hey. Alright, so, I don't really
expect for us to hang out..

127
00:10:59,295 --> 00:11:00,516
Truth is I need to get
somewhere tonight,

128
00:11:00,586 --> 00:11:01,623
and I could really use your help.

129
00:11:01,814 --> 00:11:04,487
Billy I hear you, but as I
told you I have house arrest.

130
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:06,334
There is nothing I can do about,
I am sorry.

131
00:11:06,618 --> 00:11:08,002
I mean, I can fix that.

132
00:11:08,698 --> 00:11:11,198
I know how to trick this in,
I have, I have tools.

133
00:11:11,483 --> 00:11:13,150
I have to be in my
house before seven.

134
00:11:13,468 --> 00:11:16,232
Well, If you come to my house before
seven, then I can fix it for you.

135
00:11:16,419 --> 00:11:18,760
I also have a car,
or access to a car.

136
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:21,820
And If you decide to help me,
you can have the car for a few hours.

137
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,741
<i>Come on, honey. Let's go.</i>

138
00:11:49,978 --> 00:11:51,708
<i>Don't be so hard on him.</i>

139
00:11:51,927 --> 00:11:54,310
<i>How do you think he feels
walking around town?</i>

140
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:01,010
<i>What's the plan huh?
What's he gonna do with his life?</i>

141
00:12:01,551 --> 00:12:03,428
<i>He could have been so much more.</i>

142
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:23,264
Oh My God, is that Jason Scott?

143
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:32,038
Oh my God! Jason Scott!

144
00:12:32,605 --> 00:12:33,396
Billy?

145
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:34,510
Yeah.

146
00:12:34,725 --> 00:12:36,238

- Yeah!

147
00:12:37,124 --> 00:12:38,245
- It's Six...
- Six Fifty six

148
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,523
I know, You got four minutes.
Grab that chair.

149
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:41,742
What's all this stuff?

150
00:12:41,801 --> 00:12:42,871
<i>These are the things that.</i>

151
00:12:42,941 --> 00:12:44,654
<i>I found at my dad's,
most stuff are his.</i>

152
00:12:45,128 --> 00:12:47,094
- Hey.
<i>- Where's the cage?</i>

153
00:12:47,443 --> 00:12:48,862
Here, Here it is!

154
00:12:49,037 --> 00:12:50,709
- Put your foot in this.
- What is it?

155
00:12:50,885 --> 00:12:53,526
It's a Faraday cage. It just stops
the sounds in there for a lucky.

156
00:12:53,645 --> 00:12:55,965
That's the 3 M warning.
Come on up. If the signal goes out.

157
00:12:56,171 --> 00:13:00,426
My dad's been dead now, seven
years four months and... two days?

158
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:02,487
- Yeah, two days.
- Uh, okay.

159
00:13:02,746 --> 00:13:05,319
It's a long time.
He used to work at the mine.

160
00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:07,459
Billy, I really don't think
that we have time...

161
00:13:07,603 --> 00:13:10,099
- You still live in 44-55 Old Wharf?
- Yes, I do.

162
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,399
- Great house.
- Okay.

163
00:13:12,155 --> 00:13:14,451
About my dad, we used to go
and find objects together.

164
00:13:14,605 --> 00:13:17,045
- Some really, really old.
- I am gonna get in trouble, Billy.

165
00:13:17,306 --> 00:13:19,127
Almost like that show
American Pickers.

166
00:13:19,363 --> 00:13:20,216
Billy, the signal's gonna go off.

167
00:13:20,286 --> 00:13:21,446
We should definitely
head on to a TV show

168
00:13:21,447 --> 00:13:22,568
that would've been so crazy.

169
00:13:22,731 --> 00:13:23,660
What are you doing?

170
00:13:24,218 --> 00:13:26,596
Dude, Come on. seriously!
It's gonna go!

171
00:13:26,608 --> 00:13:27,678
Billy, come on!

172
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:29,590
What?

173
00:13:38,926 --> 00:13:39,969
Thank you.

174
00:13:42,976 --> 00:13:44,188
Can you stop touching me now?

175
00:13:49,383 --> 00:13:51,080
It's so cool you
actually showed up.

176
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,896
Well. You're giving me the van.

177
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:55,003
Lending you the van, but yeah.

178
00:13:55,461 --> 00:13:56,622
How much further is it?

179
00:13:56,946 --> 00:14:00,105
Just 44 minutes and 52 seconds.

180
00:14:00,982 --> 00:14:03,318
- Okay.
- Thank you for helping me today.

181
00:14:03,513 --> 00:14:05,019
It's okay, Billy.

182
00:14:07,619 --> 00:14:10,068
This is the entrance
to the Gold Mine,

183
00:14:10,138 --> 00:14:12,521
and clearly Billy, the sign says...

184
00:14:12,663 --> 00:14:14,065
Keep driving.

185
00:14:15,968 --> 00:14:16,968
Okay.

186
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:20,467
Look, if we find something cool,
then you can keep the half.

187
00:14:20,622 --> 00:14:21,791
It's a rule that...

188
00:14:24,266 --> 00:14:25,720
They are gonna blow
this whole thing.

189
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,203
It will all be gone in a week now.

190
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,623
Billy, can I be honest?

191
00:14:28,945 --> 00:14:31,932
The deal was I drop you somewhere
I get the van for few hours okay?

192
00:14:32,145 --> 00:14:35,001
This is weird. Like we don't
know each other at all.

193
00:14:35,261 --> 00:14:37,301
I don't know what we are doing here,
and you seem...

194
00:14:37,347 --> 00:14:39,233
Wait. I gotta tell you something.

195
00:14:39,372 --> 00:14:40,391
I'm on the spectrum.

196
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:44,629
Is that like a workout program?
Like, Tae Bo?

197
00:14:45,314 --> 00:14:47,818
No. It's a diagnosis
Excuse me.

198
00:14:48,064 --> 00:14:51,221
I know! It was a joke.
I was kidding.

199
00:14:51,365 --> 00:14:53,174
See that's the thing,
I did not get the joke.

200
00:14:53,766 --> 00:14:56,177
Like my brain doesn't work
the same as yours does.

201
00:14:56,376 --> 00:14:59,097
Yeah, well,
consider that a good thing.

202
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:02,038
It's just that I can't
read humor or sarcasm.

203
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,879
But I do remember things.
I remember everything.

204
00:15:05,135 --> 00:15:06,878
- Billy, let me stop here.
- Okay.

205
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,479
You do not need to
tell me all of this.

206
00:15:09,925 --> 00:15:10,925
We are cool.

207
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:13,925
Ok, we are... We are almost there.

208
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:17,429
Which is good news.
So Take my spare flashlight...

209
00:15:17,558 --> 00:15:19,135
Cause it's gonna be
dark when you get back.

210
00:15:19,205 --> 00:15:19,806
Bye, Billy!

211
00:15:22,226 --> 00:15:22,858
Okay!

212
00:15:37,641 --> 00:15:39,285
Ah, she's back again.

213
00:15:41,687 --> 00:15:42,910
The crazy girl.

214
00:15:43,088 --> 00:15:44,931
Just like clockwork.

215
00:16:00,691 --> 00:16:02,101
Who are you?

216
00:16:35,558 --> 00:16:36,990
No way!

217
00:16:41,654 --> 00:16:42,740
Hello?

218
00:16:44,933 --> 00:16:46,061
Hey!

219
00:16:48,503 --> 00:16:49,503
Hey!

220
00:16:53,329 --> 00:16:54,353
No, no, no.

221
00:16:54,863 --> 00:16:55,863
Kimberly!

222
00:16:56,987 --> 00:16:58,103
Kimberly!

223
00:16:59,158 --> 00:17:00,335
It's okay. It's okay.

224
00:17:01,894 --> 00:17:03,779
It's strange to
hear you say my name.

225
00:17:03,849 --> 00:17:04,373
What?

226
00:17:04,792 --> 00:17:05,809
What did you say?

227
00:17:06,055 --> 00:17:08,811
I said it's strange to
hear you say my name.

228
00:17:08,995 --> 00:17:10,290
Like we know each other.

229
00:17:10,741 --> 00:17:12,532
We do know each other.

230
00:17:12,667 --> 00:17:16,183
Oh, we know who each other are,
but we don't really know each other.

231
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:18,183
I know you used to date Ty Fleming.

232
00:17:18,898 --> 00:17:21,054
Then you know I
punched his tooth out.

233
00:17:21,514 --> 00:17:23,225
I know they put it back.

234
00:17:34,403 --> 00:17:37,458
Dad, I hope you're watching
I'm gonna make you proud.

235
00:17:40,118 --> 00:17:43,821
Dad I forgot to tell you I took the
van without asking Mom's permission.

236
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:46,731
I'm telling you,
so I think that's okay.

237
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,696
Anyways, I gotta focus.

238
00:17:49,111 --> 00:17:51,742
So, what are you doing up here?
Did you follow me?

239
00:17:52,007 --> 00:17:54,447
I came with Billy.

240
00:17:54,763 --> 00:17:56,816
Billy Cranston? Weird.

241
00:17:57,069 --> 00:17:58,836
But I've seen him up here before.

242
00:17:59,424 --> 00:18:01,641
My house is on the other
side of the mountain.

243
00:18:01,823 --> 00:18:04,491
I hike these trails sometimes
to clear my head.

244
00:18:04,766 --> 00:18:08,937
And I stare down at Angel Grove and
wonder how such a small crap town...

245
00:18:09,027 --> 00:18:10,740
can cause me such misery.

246
00:18:11,838 --> 00:18:13,395
That funny to you?

247
00:18:14,379 --> 00:18:16,428
No, I just.. I feel the same way.

248
00:18:16,704 --> 00:18:20,309
Yeah. Jason Scott, the star
quarterback crashes and burns.

249
00:18:20,509 --> 00:18:23,580
Destroys his career and
destroys our season. Go, Tigers!

250
00:18:23,779 --> 00:18:25,157
Now walking around town,

251
00:18:25,227 --> 00:18:28,214
and everyone's looking me
like I ran over their dogs.

252
00:18:29,652 --> 00:18:31,172
So why don't you leave?

253
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,092
You know. Just go,

254
00:18:33,252 --> 00:18:34,940
I can leave here, you know?

255
00:18:35,153 --> 00:18:35,984
Where?

256
00:18:36,173 --> 00:18:37,327
God, anywhere.

257
00:18:37,588 --> 00:18:38,766
So let's go.

258
00:18:39,805 --> 00:18:41,490
- What?
- You would never do it.

259
00:18:41,655 --> 00:18:43,891
- Try me.
- Oh, You and me? You got a car?

260
00:18:44,221 --> 00:18:46,296
- I have a van.
- Oh, that's creepy.

261
00:18:46,591 --> 00:18:49,600
- It's not that kind of van.
- Every van's that kind of van.

262
00:18:49,812 --> 00:18:50,997
So let's go.

263
00:18:52,577 --> 00:18:54,800
Are you daring me? 'cause I'll go.

264
00:18:59,236 --> 00:19:00,292
Good.

265
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,942
Dad, get ready.

266
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:11,186
That didn't work.

267
00:19:18,094 --> 00:19:20,315
Whoops! Whoa!

268
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,604
That really run my bell.

269
00:19:22,796 --> 00:19:23,796
Go, go, go, go!

270
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:25,775
- Hey, wow!
- Wow!

271
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:27,895
What are you doing, dude?

272
00:19:27,965 --> 00:19:29,365
I've digging up
here for some years.

273
00:19:29,533 --> 00:19:31,554
Hey! Easy guys. Let's sort this out.

274
00:19:31,903 --> 00:19:33,979
- I had seen him up here before.
- Hey Jason.

275
00:19:34,233 --> 00:19:36,185
You cannot walk
around blow stuffs up.

276
00:19:36,349 --> 00:19:38,093
I was just trying to
dig a little deeper.

277
00:19:38,163 --> 00:19:39,296
Maybe I dug too deep huh.

278
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:41,951
Billy, you don't have to yell.
We can hear you, okay?

279
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:43,351
- Okay!
- Hey!

280
00:19:44,027 --> 00:19:46,128
You guys looking to get
busted or something?

281
00:19:46,198 --> 00:19:47,810
This place is a restricted area.

282
00:19:48,072 --> 00:19:50,092
Oh Really, Einstein? Restricted?

283
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:50,995
As in

284
00:19:51,199 --> 00:19:54,644
we shouldn't be standing on a crazy
rock doing some Karate kid moves right.

285
00:19:55,004 --> 00:19:56,744
- Yeah I feel you.
- Guys...

286
00:19:56,994 --> 00:20:00,372
Yeah or camping out on old trench.
I see you too homeboy.

287
00:20:00,576 --> 00:20:01,308
Guys...

288
00:20:01,397 --> 00:20:03,117
There is a lot of mine
security out tonight.

289
00:20:06,557 --> 00:20:07,557
Oh no.

290
00:20:08,535 --> 00:20:09,571
What?

291
00:20:12,548 --> 00:20:13,602
Watch out!

292
00:20:22,238 --> 00:20:23,392
Are you okay?

293
00:20:23,591 --> 00:20:25,329
Yeah, yeah, I'm ok.

294
00:20:28,312 --> 00:20:29,312
Whoa!

295
00:20:34,163 --> 00:20:35,181
What is it?

296
00:20:54,527 --> 00:20:56,671
I have never seen
glass like this before.

297
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:58,125
Oh My God.

298
00:21:01,363 --> 00:21:03,605
Who is it? What is that?

299
00:21:03,972 --> 00:21:05,530
There is something in there.

300
00:21:06,073 --> 00:21:07,073
Hey.

301
00:21:08,373 --> 00:21:09,373
Move!

302
00:21:09,653 --> 00:21:10,674
Watch out. Watch out.

303
00:21:11,004 --> 00:21:12,768
- What are you doing?
- No no no.

304
00:21:12,933 --> 00:21:14,254
- Seriously?
- What are you doing?

305
00:21:14,295 --> 00:21:15,295
Yeah!

306
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,865
My dad always knew the right spots.

307
00:21:21,131 --> 00:21:22,131
There's gotta be more.

308
00:21:22,378 --> 00:21:24,363
Come on. Get out of the way!

309
00:21:26,727 --> 00:21:27,727
What is it?

310
00:21:29,085 --> 00:21:30,085
What's that?

311
00:21:33,299 --> 00:21:35,731
What? No, no, no, no!
Don't break. Don't break!

312
00:21:35,932 --> 00:21:37,471
Don't break it. Don't break!

313
00:21:37,665 --> 00:21:39,319
You broke it. Okay.

314
00:21:42,639 --> 00:21:43,639
Wow, What?

315
00:21:50,863 --> 00:21:52,462
Oh My God, what is that?

316
00:21:52,805 --> 00:21:55,610
Yo look, we all found these...

317
00:21:55,785 --> 00:21:58,274
- No, he found them. Chill out.
- Chill out?

318
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,890
Guys, guys, do you hear that?

319
00:22:01,886 --> 00:22:04,207
Mine security. Peace.

320
00:22:04,379 --> 00:22:06,119
Someone should have
pointed that out.

321
00:22:06,189 --> 00:22:06,817
Wait, I did.

322
00:22:07,088 --> 00:22:08,088
Billy!

323
00:22:08,266 --> 00:22:10,187
- Wait! Okay, okay!
- Run! Run!

324
00:22:11,022 --> 00:22:12,810
Billy! Come on, come on!

325
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:16,250
- Billy! Let's go!
- I'm going!

326
00:22:21,877 --> 00:22:23,262
- Jason! Jason!
- You gotta open the door.

327
00:22:23,468 --> 00:22:24,892
Open the door! Open it!

328
00:22:25,143 --> 00:22:27,294
- Yes, okay, get in.
- What are you doing?

329
00:22:27,573 --> 00:22:28,931
Do you see them?
Are they on the road?

330
00:22:29,001 --> 00:22:29,662
I don't know.

331
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,880
Okay.

332
00:22:32,235 --> 00:22:34,440
Ok, what about the others?
You gonna leave the others?

333
00:22:34,995 --> 00:22:35,995
Hold on!

334
00:22:37,652 --> 00:22:39,977
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Jason!

335
00:22:40,341 --> 00:22:41,439
What did you do?

336
00:22:47,955 --> 00:22:49,647
My mom's gonna kill me.

337
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:53,125
God! get your seatbelt on.

338
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,001
Jason, somebody's gonna die!

339
00:23:00,682 --> 00:23:02,017
- There they are!
- Okay So...

340
00:23:02,195 --> 00:23:04,023
- The Hill.
- Come on!

341
00:23:04,958 --> 00:23:07,099
- Ok, you drive.
- I really don't drive.

342
00:23:07,248 --> 00:23:10,251
- Really don't drive.
- ...So I can pull them in.

343
00:23:10,425 --> 00:23:11,425
I don't do...

344
00:23:12,455 --> 00:23:13,831
Get your foot!

345
00:23:14,356 --> 00:23:17,711
- It says that the door's open.
- Because it's open, Billy!

346
00:23:18,492 --> 00:23:19,624
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

347
00:23:21,363 --> 00:23:22,800
Go, go go!

348
00:23:22,958 --> 00:23:23,759
Good.

349
00:23:23,889 --> 00:23:25,744
There they are!

350
00:23:25,945 --> 00:23:26,945
Get in!

351
00:23:28,864 --> 00:23:29,864
Got you.

352
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:31,429
- I Got you.
- I'm in!

353
00:23:34,865 --> 00:23:36,292
What about the other guy?

354
00:23:38,261 --> 00:23:39,856
- Just go!
- Just go!

355
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:41,092
Billy look out!

356
00:23:45,398 --> 00:23:47,244
Let's go downhill!
Go to the lights pool off!

357
00:23:47,489 --> 00:23:49,316
- You wanna drive man?
- Keep going, we are almost there.

358
00:23:49,513 --> 00:23:50,915
Guys, guy, it's the train!

359
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:52,650
We got it.

360
00:23:58,156 --> 00:23:59,156
Okay.

361
00:23:59,693 --> 00:24:00,966
Oh my, oh my God!

362
00:24:01,203 --> 00:24:02,203
Hey.

363
00:24:02,318 --> 00:24:04,719
- Man, what do you want me to do?
- Keep going. I'll pull him in.

364
00:24:04,869 --> 00:24:05,869
Okay.

365
00:24:08,869 --> 00:24:10,021
Are you crazy?

366
00:24:10,335 --> 00:24:11,633
Yeah, I am.

367
00:24:13,809 --> 00:24:15,171
Just catching up.

368
00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:20,316
Look there is the rail road crossing.
That's the way out, Billy.

369
00:24:25,809 --> 00:24:26,515
You got it.

370
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:27,524
You got it.

371
00:24:27,657 --> 00:24:29,310
- I hope he has it.
- He Definitely doesn’t not have it.

372
00:24:29,625 --> 00:24:31,081
I got it, I got it.

373
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:04,745
The storm's turned. It's going bad.
We're getting out of here.

374
00:25:09,885 --> 00:25:11,398
Let's go!

375
00:25:11,586 --> 00:25:12,686
Let's go!

376
00:25:14,386 --> 00:25:15,738
Hold it forward!

377
00:25:16,291 --> 00:25:17,928
Hold. Let's go!

378
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:21,888
Let's go.

379
00:25:24,058 --> 00:25:25,259
Let it go!

380
00:25:30,497 --> 00:25:31,649
..The hell is that?

381
00:25:32,142 --> 00:25:33,503
Get back!

382
00:25:39,482 --> 00:25:40,563
Everything to port!

383
00:25:40,794 --> 00:25:41,794
Good.

384
00:26:24,676 --> 00:26:25,676
Okay.

385
00:26:27,791 --> 00:26:28,856
Yeah...

386
00:26:32,855 --> 00:26:35,148
<i>Billy, what's happening?</i>

387
00:26:57,462 --> 00:26:58,470
What?

388
00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:37,690
- Where's your bodyguard?
- What are you doing?

389
00:27:37,912 --> 00:27:40,897
I'm just gonna quietly
snap your wrist, you little bitch.

390
00:27:54,567 --> 00:27:55,972
No, no, no...

391
00:27:56,143 --> 00:27:57,143
Okay.

392
00:27:58,496 --> 00:28:02,147
Billy Cranston just knocked
Colt Wallace out cold.

393
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:05,911
Hi, Billy.

394
00:28:08,624 --> 00:28:10,325
Hey, come on, come on.

395
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:16,300
- Am I crazy or this is crazy?
- It's crazy.

396
00:28:16,585 --> 00:28:19,429
We got hit by a train and we are
standing here. How is that possible?

397
00:28:19,683 --> 00:28:22,003
I don't remember getting home
from the mine at all.

398
00:28:22,178 --> 00:28:24,340
I slept all day Yesterday.

399
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,312
We gotta find Billy.

400
00:28:26,667 --> 00:28:29,388
You know, I wasn't trying to start
any trouble or anything like that.

401
00:28:29,572 --> 00:28:31,507
I said, "Hey man! Look I'm
not a violent person".

402
00:28:31,707 --> 00:28:34,868
But if you must come at me,
come at me, bro.

403
00:28:35,068 --> 00:28:35,852
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

404
00:28:35,955 --> 00:28:39,620
- Boom! Down goes douchbag.
- Down goes... I can't say the word.

405
00:28:39,824 --> 00:28:40,824
Billy.

406
00:28:42,175 --> 00:28:44,269
Hey, Kimberly, Kimberly Hart.

407
00:28:44,601 --> 00:28:45,712
We need to talk.

408
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:48,744
How? How? What?

409
00:28:50,157 --> 00:28:51,918
Since when does he
knows Kimberly Hart?

410
00:28:51,988 --> 00:28:53,008
Billy is awesome.

411
00:28:54,505 --> 00:28:55,701
Nice hair.

412
00:28:58,568 --> 00:28:59,838
Billy. Look at me,

413
00:29:00,633 --> 00:29:01,999
Do you feel weird?

414
00:29:02,397 --> 00:29:03,955
You mean like weird than usual?

415
00:29:04,164 --> 00:29:05,822
Yeah. Different.

416
00:29:10,064 --> 00:29:11,064
Listen.

417
00:29:11,859 --> 00:29:13,593
We know something
happened out there, okay?

418
00:29:13,663 --> 00:29:14,406
I'm not the same.

419
00:29:14,601 --> 00:29:16,072
Me neither. I'm strong!

420
00:29:16,299 --> 00:29:18,618
- How strong?
- Like insanely strong.

421
00:29:19,692 --> 00:29:21,693
I feel like we need
to go back out there.

422
00:29:26,694 --> 00:29:28,375
The counter is boiling.

423
00:29:41,583 --> 00:29:43,021
I'm going back today.

424
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:45,992
Ah. She down here.

425
00:29:46,508 --> 00:29:47,683
Sure it's a woman?

426
00:29:48,606 --> 00:29:51,626
Not a great-looking woman.
Come see for yourself.

427
00:29:53,006 --> 00:29:54,417
Oh the smell is...

428
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,660
It's intense.

429
00:29:55,829 --> 00:29:57,256
You should make a note of that.

430
00:29:57,356 --> 00:30:00,362
Smell inside of a north fishing boat
that hold tons of dead fish...

431
00:30:00,608 --> 00:30:03,151
Don't smell so good. Freaky, right?

432
00:30:03,621 --> 00:30:05,200
Look, do you need us?

433
00:30:05,443 --> 00:30:07,945
Alright, cause I need to get to bed.
Lock up when you're done.

434
00:30:08,055 --> 00:30:09,549
There's beers in the fridge.

435
00:30:20,827 --> 00:30:21,910
Jesus.

436
00:30:32,329 --> 00:30:33,329
Jesus.

437
00:30:38,506 --> 00:30:41,831
Unit two, this is Meinen.
I have a body here. Deceased female.

438
00:30:53,299 --> 00:30:54,597
Let's just keep going.

439
00:30:58,446 --> 00:31:00,695
Guys, look. It's that guy again.

440
00:31:01,005 --> 00:31:02,957
Find anything interesting?

441
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:05,570
If I do, I'm keeping it.

442
00:31:05,741 --> 00:31:07,231
We know why you're here.

443
00:31:07,492 --> 00:31:08,492
Oh ya?

444
00:31:08,857 --> 00:31:12,918
You guys wake up surprised
to be alive and jump over a house.

445
00:31:13,081 --> 00:31:15,011
Yeah! Kindda. What? no.

446
00:31:15,731 --> 00:31:18,012
We are different, alright.
Everything is different.

447
00:31:18,152 --> 00:31:19,605
You're Zack, right?

448
00:31:20,362 --> 00:31:21,362
Yup.

449
00:31:21,737 --> 00:31:23,133
You still got Angel Grove?

450
00:31:23,532 --> 00:31:24,769
Sometimes.

451
00:31:27,116 --> 00:31:29,366
The other girl was here too
about an hour ago.

452
00:31:29,834 --> 00:31:31,748
Hey, You mean that girl right there?

453
00:31:31,886 --> 00:31:33,499
Hey! Come on down!

454
00:31:34,641 --> 00:31:35,939
We solve together!

455
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:40,522
Wow!

456
00:31:40,673 --> 00:31:41,793
Oh screw this.

457
00:31:42,498 --> 00:31:44,408
- Okay, lemme.
- He got up there pretty fast.

458
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:45,652
No no no!

459
00:31:51,498 --> 00:31:52,577
Yo, Keep up.

460
00:32:00,855 --> 00:32:01,855
Stop!

461
00:32:08,442 --> 00:32:09,920
Just, just talk to me.

462
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:14,386
You have a coin. We have a coin.

463
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:17,179
We should just talk about this.
I mean... We don't know what...

464
00:32:18,565 --> 00:32:20,268
Whoa ho!

465
00:32:20,412 --> 00:32:21,635
What is wrong with you?

466
00:32:24,841 --> 00:32:27,743
You're crazy! But so am I.

467
00:32:28,211 --> 00:32:29,963
- Woah, Zack.
- I got this.

468
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:31,355
- Wait.
- No, I got this.

469
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:32,766
Woah woah!

470
00:32:43,621 --> 00:32:44,621
Huh!

471
00:32:45,558 --> 00:32:47,412
- I got her!
- Let go of me!

472
00:32:48,102 --> 00:32:49,367
Just jump over.

473
00:32:49,573 --> 00:32:51,242
Let's go. Jump with me.

474
00:32:51,471 --> 00:32:53,302
- No no no. Don't jump. Don't jump.
- Okay.

475
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,787
I'm gonna jump across with her
and then you jump, okay?

476
00:32:55,922 --> 00:32:56,711
Piece of cake.

477
00:32:56,816 --> 00:32:59,273
No no no! Don't! Jason! Hey!

478
00:32:59,463 --> 00:33:01,118
That's not a piece of cake.

479
00:33:11,554 --> 00:33:13,515
- You alright?
- Yah, no problem.

480
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:16,181
You got this, Billy!

481
00:33:16,342 --> 00:33:18,314
- No I don't!
- It's fun.

482
00:33:18,467 --> 00:33:20,318
- It's such a broad jump!
- Cimon.

483
00:33:20,584 --> 00:33:21,864
- Billy, chon.
- We all did it.

484
00:33:22,108 --> 00:33:24,131
You'll be fine, I promise.
Just jump.

485
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:25,303
C’mon, c’mon.

486
00:33:25,418 --> 00:33:28,469
The drop is probably more than 100
feet which means death is imminent.

487
00:33:28,567 --> 00:33:30,668
Okay, so if you die Billy.
What's gonna happens?

488
00:33:30,836 --> 00:33:32,357
Your mom will be alone.
But it's okay,

489
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:33,824
cause she can find somebody else.

490
00:33:34,018 --> 00:33:35,863
But she couldn't,
cause you love your momma.

491
00:33:36,012 --> 00:33:37,840
- He is scared.
- Come across. He's fine.

492
00:33:37,985 --> 00:33:41,269
Okay. Okay, alright.

493
00:33:41,466 --> 00:33:43,069
Let's do it.

494
00:33:43,219 --> 00:33:44,219
Okay!

495
00:33:53,619 --> 00:33:55,065
Billy, you got this.

496
00:33:56,045 --> 00:33:57,045
Oh shit!

497
00:33:59,255 --> 00:34:00,437
- Are you okay?
- I got it.

498
00:34:00,619 --> 00:34:01,413
Come on. Climb up.

499
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:02,860
- I did it.
- Billy, you got it.

500
00:34:02,941 --> 00:34:05,069
See what we tell you, Billy.
You got it!

501
00:34:05,139 --> 00:34:06,175
Told you, see?

502
00:34:06,576 --> 00:34:07,576
Yes!

503
00:34:07,661 --> 00:34:09,226
Billy idol! Yeah!

504
00:34:10,801 --> 00:34:12,247
- Oh My God.
- Billy!

505
00:34:13,062 --> 00:34:14,062
Billy!

506
00:34:14,972 --> 00:34:16,092
Billy!

507
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,529
Billy!

508
00:34:19,309 --> 00:34:21,270
- We just kill that dude?
- What do we do?

509
00:34:24,868 --> 00:34:27,189
Hey, guys! You have to get off!

510
00:34:27,395 --> 00:34:29,423
There's water!
You've got to see this!

511
00:34:30,441 --> 00:34:31,542
He's fine.

512
00:34:33,073 --> 00:34:35,935
Yo. Alright. I'll see you guys
down there.

513
00:34:36,506 --> 00:34:37,923
Bring that crazy girl.

514
00:34:40,377 --> 00:34:42,422
Come on, you guys. Let's go!

515
00:34:44,421 --> 00:34:45,421
Whoa!

516
00:34:51,959 --> 00:34:52,959
Hey!

517
00:34:53,767 --> 00:34:55,609
Can I get a sip of your water?

518
00:34:56,434 --> 00:34:57,580
I'm dying.

519
00:35:00,222 --> 00:35:03,368
Hey. Just don't finish it.

520
00:35:03,576 --> 00:35:06,144
Thanks. And I'm really sorry.

521
00:35:06,457 --> 00:35:07,524
Sorry for what?

522
00:35:24,525 --> 00:35:26,516
Welcome to the club!

523
00:35:27,424 --> 00:35:28,877
What's up, crazy girl?

524
00:35:29,425 --> 00:35:30,939
We gotta do that again.

525
00:35:37,905 --> 00:35:39,280
Hey, guys. Guys!

526
00:35:39,624 --> 00:35:40,624
What?

527
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:42,925
- Check out how we glow.
- Cool.

528
00:35:43,111 --> 00:35:44,820
- Yeah!
- I like this.

529
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:46,238
I'm blue!

530
00:35:46,912 --> 00:35:48,651
It's not my favorite color,
but it's cool.

531
00:35:49,452 --> 00:35:50,484
I am black!

532
00:35:50,867 --> 00:35:52,427
- What?
- I am.

533
00:35:52,612 --> 00:35:54,577
No, you're not.

534
00:36:04,926 --> 00:36:06,013
Hey, guys.

535
00:36:06,668 --> 00:36:08,833
There's something down there,
follow me.

536
00:37:39,188 --> 00:37:40,683
- Where we are?
- I don’t know.

537
00:37:40,908 --> 00:37:42,352
Jason! I'm sliding.

538
00:37:51,083 --> 00:37:51,819
Hi.

539
00:37:52,033 --> 00:37:53,033
Again?

540
00:37:56,628 --> 00:37:58,251
Well, that is unusual.

541
00:38:03,354 --> 00:38:05,421
It just gets better and better.

542
00:38:06,216 --> 00:38:07,434
Do you feel that?

543
00:38:10,921 --> 00:38:12,254
Something out here.

544
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:14,071
The walls are shaking.

545
00:38:15,024 --> 00:38:16,105
Come on.

546
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,034
That is impossible.

547
00:38:55,391 --> 00:38:58,090
This must have been here for
millions of years.

548
00:38:58,357 --> 00:39:00,834
Look how the rocks
is growing around it.

549
00:39:02,725 --> 00:39:04,214
I do not like this place.

550
00:39:07,238 --> 00:39:08,378
Hey, guys.

551
00:39:11,833 --> 00:39:12,922
Check it out.

552
00:39:22,829 --> 00:39:24,223
- It's okay.
- It's okay.

553
00:39:30,724 --> 00:39:31,724
Okay.

554
00:39:35,841 --> 00:39:37,641
- Holy...
- Shhh!

555
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:41,084
- Think there's aliens in here?
- Just be quiet, Zack.

556
00:39:41,238 --> 00:39:42,816
It's so cold in here.

557
00:39:45,141 --> 00:39:46,539
Jason, is this real?

558
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,204
Like are we really in
a spaceship right now?

559
00:39:49,205 --> 00:39:51,707
I think so. Just breathe. Okay?

560
00:39:51,907 --> 00:39:52,407
It's okay.

561
00:39:52,561 --> 00:39:54,762
Hey! We've all seen enough here.
Right?

562
00:39:54,832 --> 00:39:55,874
We should go now?

563
00:39:56,005 --> 00:39:57,755
What? We're gonna be famous.

564
00:39:57,992 --> 00:39:59,761
- What's wrong with you?
- Quiet!

565
00:40:01,094 --> 00:40:02,392
There's something here.

566
00:40:07,076 --> 00:40:08,076
Woah!

567
00:40:09,501 --> 00:40:10,501
What is that?

568
00:40:17,629 --> 00:40:18,776
What's going on?

569
00:40:18,997 --> 00:40:20,272
- Stairs!
- Oh my God!

570
00:40:20,391 --> 00:40:21,423
No way out.

571
00:40:22,622 --> 00:40:24,357
That way. Let's go!

572
00:40:24,915 --> 00:40:25,783
I'm going.

573
00:40:25,842 --> 00:40:26,842
Run!

574
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:38,270
C’mon, c’mon.

575
00:40:50,328 --> 00:40:51,743
Didi, I'm coming.

576
00:40:54,563 --> 00:40:55,702
They're real!

577
00:40:56,999 --> 00:40:58,133
Leave her alone!

578
00:41:02,522 --> 00:41:03,732
We will kill you.

579
00:41:03,925 --> 00:41:05,446
Kill me? How?

580
00:41:06,243 --> 00:41:07,343
There's five of us.

581
00:41:07,525 --> 00:41:08,875
Yes, I know.
I've been waiting for you.

582
00:41:08,945 --> 00:41:10,105
Wait, where is the other guy?

583
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:12,198
One, two, three, four...
Ah, there he is.

584
00:41:13,145 --> 00:41:14,744
No no no.

585
00:41:17,929 --> 00:41:19,067
All of you.

586
00:41:19,516 --> 00:41:22,658
In a spaceship buried underground?
How long have you been waiting?

587
00:41:22,919 --> 00:41:24,575
- What's the day? Monday?
- Yeah.

588
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:26,851
Then, 65 million years.

589
00:41:27,966 --> 00:41:29,925
I've been very lonely.

590
00:41:31,045 --> 00:41:32,917
You all so young looking.

591
00:41:34,021 --> 00:41:36,810
- This has to do with the coins?
- Yes, the coins!

592
00:41:37,065 --> 00:41:40,070
Different colors, different kids.
Different color kids!

593
00:41:40,572 --> 00:41:42,058
No one said you're here!

594
00:41:43,666 --> 00:41:44,666
Turn around.

595
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:48,487
Go on.

596
00:41:53,197 --> 00:41:54,482
No way.

597
00:41:56,033 --> 00:41:57,382
Proceed.

598
00:41:57,834 --> 00:41:59,614
I think this will work.

599
00:41:59,852 --> 00:42:02,046
One Two Three Four Five.
Different colors.

600
00:42:02,425 --> 00:42:04,764
Guys, focus on getting out of here.

601
00:42:04,836 --> 00:42:07,866
Stay together and when we
see a chance, we run like hell.

602
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:11,348
Okay. And if we don't get a chance?
Then we kill it.

603
00:42:14,326 --> 00:42:17,747
Shouldn't hurt, but let's see.
Please step into the footprints.

604
00:42:17,848 --> 00:42:21,299
- No, we will not.
- Hey, Question. What are you?

605
00:42:21,527 --> 00:42:24,699
I am Alpha 5, persona Android.

606
00:42:24,748 --> 00:42:25,469
What?

607
00:42:25,649 --> 00:42:27,448
- He said he's an Alpha 5...
- Yes, I know.

608
00:42:27,536 --> 00:42:30,538
I'm a talking robot.
You can trust me.

609
00:42:34,449 --> 00:42:35,495
Billy!

610
00:42:47,601 --> 00:42:48,626
What the hell.

611
00:42:53,735 --> 00:42:54,735
Okay.

612
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:04,897
Why they look at each other?
Is a human characteristic?

613
00:43:05,112 --> 00:43:06,112
Fascinating.

614
00:43:24,467 --> 00:43:27,014
It works! This is great!
It's working!

615
00:43:27,246 --> 00:43:29,137
Zordon! Are you there, Zordon?

616
00:43:29,327 --> 00:43:31,872
Alpha! Where we are?

617
00:43:32,138 --> 00:43:34,445
Zordon, nice to hear your voice.

618
00:43:34,538 --> 00:43:36,164
I can see you, Alpha...

619
00:43:36,348 --> 00:43:37,692
...but I can't see me.

620
00:43:38,101 --> 00:43:39,853
Where am I?

621
00:43:40,032 --> 00:43:41,767
You're inside the ship.

622
00:43:42,344 --> 00:43:43,832
Okay. Okay.

623
00:43:43,902 --> 00:43:47,138
Sir, I sealed your essence
into the ship's matrix.

624
00:43:49,699 --> 00:43:50,528
C'mon.

625
00:43:50,654 --> 00:43:51,829
Let's go! Move on!

626
00:43:51,924 --> 00:43:53,949
But the ship is on?

627
00:43:53,963 --> 00:43:56,214
The power coins have finally
returned to the ship.

628
00:43:56,554 --> 00:43:57,554
Go, go, go.

629
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:02,654
Where are the coins?

630
00:44:03,003 --> 00:44:05,593
Where are the rangers?

631
00:44:05,753 --> 00:44:07,611
Come forward, please.

632
00:44:08,543 --> 00:44:09,853
Do we have a choice?

633
00:44:10,055 --> 00:44:11,092
I do not think so.

634
00:44:11,093 --> 00:44:14,454
They speak a primitive dialect
called English.

635
00:44:14,506 --> 00:44:17,722
You'll find it in the ship's matrix.

636
00:44:18,454 --> 00:44:20,689
Look! It's Zordon!

637
00:44:20,885 --> 00:44:21,885
What?

638
00:44:22,495 --> 00:44:25,012
Zordon,
they don't know who you were.

639
00:44:25,283 --> 00:44:26,674
Come in, come in.

640
00:44:26,905 --> 00:44:29,415
These are them? They are so small.

641
00:44:29,696 --> 00:44:31,208
Funny, I said the same thing.

642
00:44:31,456 --> 00:44:33,796
You mean to tell me that
the fate of the universe,

643
00:44:34,056 --> 00:44:36,441
placed in the hands
of these children?

644
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,558
The universe? That's a big place.

645
00:44:38,834 --> 00:44:42,697
They're teenagers. Somewhere between
infancy and full maturity.

646
00:44:42,897 --> 00:44:44,077
It's hard to explain really.

647
00:44:44,257 --> 00:44:45,643
Show me the coins.

648
00:44:48,308 --> 00:44:50,157
The Morphing Grid is never wrong.

649
00:44:50,442 --> 00:44:53,340
If the power coins have returned
to the ship with these...

650
00:44:53,542 --> 00:44:54,267
Teenagers!

651
00:44:54,532 --> 00:44:56,247
With these teenagers...

652
00:44:56,357 --> 00:44:59,779
then these teenagers
are the Power Rangers.

653
00:44:59,977 --> 00:45:01,058
Power Rangers!

654
00:45:02,857 --> 00:45:03,857
What?

655
00:45:04,043 --> 00:45:05,851
Okay, a quick question.

656
00:45:06,012 --> 00:45:07,757
Hello. Hate to interrupt.

657
00:45:08,041 --> 00:45:10,457
Did I just hear you say
we're Power Rangers?

658
00:45:10,622 --> 00:45:15,194
Yes. Yes. You are the Power Rangers.
Any other questions?

659
00:45:15,433 --> 00:45:17,226
- No. I think I'm good.
- Good.

660
00:45:17,478 --> 00:45:18,478
I have a question.

661
00:45:18,553 --> 00:45:20,110
Hi. How you doing?

662
00:45:21,498 --> 00:45:22,984
My name is Billy. Billy Cranston.

663
00:45:23,297 --> 00:45:25,444
Kids used to called
me Billy Cramps...

664
00:45:25,576 --> 00:45:27,254
Billy! Stop.

665
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:28,603
Sorry.

666
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:33,459
The images here in this sphere tell
the history of the Power Rangers.

667
00:45:33,626 --> 00:45:36,913
Looks like the Power Rangers
were a team that protected life?

668
00:45:37,137 --> 00:45:40,619
And life is a bright light.
Or a piece of light?

669
00:45:40,756 --> 00:45:44,493
Yes. Yes, Very good Billy.
It is called the Zeo Crystal.

670
00:45:44,758 --> 00:45:46,208
Oh. I love this part. This is good.

671
00:45:46,445 --> 00:45:48,852
And every planet in the universe
that has life.

672
00:45:49,061 --> 00:45:51,453
Has a piece of the
Crystal buried inside it.

673
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,031
65 million years ago,
Zordon's team died...

674
00:45:54,378 --> 00:45:57,161
defending the Crystal here and
what is now Angel Grove.

675
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:59,460
The Coins have chose you five.

676
00:45:59,661 --> 00:46:04,080
Now you must protect the
Zeo Crystal and life on Earth.

677
00:46:04,385 --> 00:46:08,012
Because we are the Power Rangers?

678
00:46:08,261 --> 00:46:09,393
He's smart!

679
00:46:09,582 --> 00:46:11,862
I'm sorry,
is this some kind of a joke?

680
00:46:12,061 --> 00:46:13,874
Like I'm standing here,
with a wet wedgies.

681
00:46:14,014 --> 00:46:16,446
My socks are so squiggling around,

682
00:46:16,699 --> 00:46:18,443
We're talking to a wall.
I mean guys...

683
00:46:18,513 --> 00:46:19,109
Silence!

684
00:47:12,903 --> 00:47:15,183
Sir,
I am detecting elevated heart rate.

685
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,222
They are very scared.

686
00:47:17,527 --> 00:47:18,968
I don't understand.

687
00:47:19,112 --> 00:47:20,739
Why would you show
us that nightmare?

688
00:47:20,809 --> 00:47:21,984
It's not a nightmare.

689
00:47:22,241 --> 00:47:23,845
- It's the future.
- Is that for real?

690
00:47:24,027 --> 00:47:25,812
- Felt like it.
- Who was that woman?

691
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:27,664
Her name is Rita Repulsa.

692
00:47:27,946 --> 00:47:30,136
She will create Goldar,
a huge monster

693
00:47:30,206 --> 00:47:32,751
who will rip the crystal
from the earth...

694
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:35,690
and all life on your
planet will die.

695
00:47:35,861 --> 00:47:40,666
With the Crystal, Rita will have the
power to create and destroy worlds.

696
00:47:40,943 --> 00:47:45,376
So let me guess. You want
us to kill this woman, Rita?

697
00:47:45,482 --> 00:47:48,233
- Aye, aye, Rita.
- She must be stopped.

698
00:47:48,637 --> 00:47:50,813
- When is she coming?
- It's already here.

699
00:47:50,992 --> 00:47:52,915
My best guess is that
we have 11 months.

700
00:47:53,139 --> 00:47:55,871
I am sorry. Days. Eleven days.

701
00:47:56,268 --> 00:47:58,684
If we are the Power Rangers
and this is our ship...

702
00:47:58,904 --> 00:48:01,185
If I walk through that door
right now will it open for me?

703
00:48:01,322 --> 00:48:02,438
Yes of course.

704
00:48:02,542 --> 00:48:03,542
Come on.

705
00:48:03,671 --> 00:48:05,115
Wait, what are you doing?

706
00:48:05,388 --> 00:48:06,868
No, no, no, come back!

707
00:48:07,290 --> 00:48:09,322
- No. please don't.
- Jason!

708
00:48:09,432 --> 00:48:12,374
My ranger team died
defending the Crystal from Rita.

709
00:48:12,969 --> 00:48:14,669
That's why I'm in this wall.

710
00:48:15,504 --> 00:48:16,875
How do you know my name?

711
00:48:17,258 --> 00:48:20,252
Because it's you, Jason Scott.

712
00:48:20,467 --> 00:48:24,768
You are the leader.
You're the Red Ranger.

713
00:48:27,975 --> 00:48:31,668
Rita was a Ranger too,
and my friend.

714
00:48:32,193 --> 00:48:33,969
But she betrayed us.

715
00:48:34,287 --> 00:48:35,998
Wanted more power.

716
00:48:36,583 --> 00:48:38,170
She lost her way.

717
00:48:38,502 --> 00:48:41,752
Now she is just pure evil.

718
00:48:42,290 --> 00:48:45,209
You must bring them
back all of the Rangers.

719
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:47,819
You must train your
team to stop Rita...

720
00:48:47,993 --> 00:48:50,920
before she has the strength
to find the crystal.

721
00:48:51,099 --> 00:48:54,969
Okay, I'm leaving.
And I speak only for myself...

722
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,259
No! You speak for all of them.

723
00:48:57,555 --> 00:49:00,473
You know that deep down
what I am saying is true.

724
00:49:00,746 --> 00:49:02,639
You were born for this.

725
00:49:04,706 --> 00:49:05,706
Who exactly are you?

726
00:49:05,976 --> 00:49:07,679
Really?
Now you gonna ask me who I am?

727
00:49:07,879 --> 00:49:09,620
- Look, her name is Didi.
- Trini.

728
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:10,844
She's new at school

729
00:49:10,845 --> 00:49:13,421
transferred in a month ago.
We have English together, right?

730
00:49:13,621 --> 00:49:14,760
I have been in Angel Grove,

731
00:49:14,830 --> 00:49:16,685
for over a year now we
have Biology together.

732
00:49:16,861 --> 00:49:18,827
- Good talk.
- Wait, look.

733
00:49:19,111 --> 00:49:21,538
None of us really know each other,
okay?

734
00:49:21,890 --> 00:49:24,842
Bu somehow,
we were all in the same place...

735
00:49:25,077 --> 00:49:27,620
at the same time when
Billy found those coins.

736
00:49:27,916 --> 00:49:28,044
And.

737
00:49:28,114 --> 00:49:29,821
No, Wait wait.
Can I ask a question?

738
00:49:30,446 --> 00:49:31,963
Are we really superheroes?

739
00:49:32,033 --> 00:49:34,250
We're More like Iron
Man or Spider-Man?

740
00:49:34,424 --> 00:49:37,223
Cause I feel like I've been bit by
a spider, but I feel really good...

741
00:49:37,571 --> 00:49:39,527
- I just feel good.
- Look bro, trust me.

742
00:49:39,725 --> 00:49:41,093
You're not a superhero.

743
00:49:41,293 --> 00:49:43,333
Why are you talking like to us
like you're the boss?

744
00:49:43,378 --> 00:49:45,990
Hey, hold up.
Can any of this Rita stuff be real?

745
00:49:46,195 --> 00:49:48,447
- Can any of it be true?
- I don't know.

746
00:49:48,636 --> 00:49:51,830
But I know that the answer to
what's wrong with us...

747
00:49:51,929 --> 00:49:55,400
and what's happening to us, is here.

748
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:00,156
So... What are you saying?

749
00:50:01,019 --> 00:50:02,848
I think we gotta come back.

750
00:50:03,602 --> 00:50:07,725
I can't make you come back here,
but 4'o clock tomorrow

751
00:50:08,809 --> 00:50:09,886
I will be here.

752
00:50:10,357 --> 00:50:12,194
Hey, Jason. We don't...

753
00:50:14,984 --> 00:50:15,984
Of course!

754
00:50:16,242 --> 00:50:19,226
I do not know, I didn't think
about that one in the first place.

755
00:51:02,162 --> 00:51:03,478
So..Where were you today?

756
00:51:03,662 --> 00:51:06,176
Were you with friends?
Do you have any friends?

757
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:08,834
- Why are you do tired?
- You did ask her four questions...

758
00:51:09,062 --> 00:51:10,200
before she's even
answered the first.

759
00:51:10,270 --> 00:51:11,750
Because she's like
a ghost around here.

760
00:51:11,808 --> 00:51:13,788
She needs to start communicating.

761
00:51:13,982 --> 00:51:15,324
- June.
- Say something.

762
00:51:15,563 --> 00:51:17,815
- Speak! I just...
- Relax.

763
00:51:17,934 --> 00:51:19,642
Okay, relax.

764
00:51:20,921 --> 00:51:22,953
Okay, Trini, let's start over.

765
00:51:23,726 --> 00:51:26,089
Please tell us one
thing you did today.

766
00:51:28,475 --> 00:51:30,197
Me and four kids from Angel Grove

767
00:51:30,267 --> 00:51:32,197
found a spaceship
buried underground.

768
00:51:32,399 --> 00:51:33,501
What?

769
00:51:34,777 --> 00:51:37,058
I'm pretty sure I'm a superhero.

770
00:51:38,471 --> 00:51:39,474
Cool!

771
00:51:39,686 --> 00:51:41,040
Not cool.

772
00:51:41,248 --> 00:51:42,761
Pee in that cup!

773
00:51:48,010 --> 00:51:49,998
It's to remind me of my screw up?

774
00:51:50,361 --> 00:51:51,501
No.

775
00:51:52,425 --> 00:51:54,769
Wrecking yard only offered
me 300 bucks for it.

776
00:51:57,297 --> 00:52:00,077
You know the frame's straight and
the engine still runs.

777
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,067
It's a terrible situation.
You gotta come with me.

778
00:52:08,909 --> 00:52:10,894
A series of grisly crimes scenes

779
00:52:10,964 --> 00:52:14,127
has the sleepy fishing hamlet
of Angel Grove reeling

780
00:52:15,541 --> 00:52:17,711
bodies were discovered
on a fishing boat.

781
00:52:17,873 --> 00:52:20,499
This raft of violence..

782
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:34,796
What the hell are you doing?

783
00:52:35,001 --> 00:52:40,234
I need gold,
I build my beautiful Goldar.

784
00:52:40,410 --> 00:52:44,546
Goldar takes the Zeo Crystal
I take the universe.

785
00:52:45,682 --> 00:52:46,930
They do!

786
00:53:22,634 --> 00:53:23,825
So Crazy girl.

787
00:53:23,831 --> 00:53:24,699
Hey.

788
00:53:24,747 --> 00:53:25,747
Shall we do this?

789
00:53:27,369 --> 00:53:30,239
You need to follow the three rules
to being a Power Ranger.

790
00:53:30,556 --> 00:53:33,105
You must never use your
powers for personal gain.

791
00:53:33,330 --> 00:53:37,498
You must never escalate a fight.
Unless your enemy forces you to.

792
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:41,092
And you must never
reveal your identity. ever.

793
00:53:41,228 --> 00:53:44,076
To assume your ranger identities
you need to morph.

794
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:46,046
Have any of you morphed before?

795
00:53:46,263 --> 00:53:48,809
Yes, but only in the shower.

796
00:53:49,324 --> 00:53:52,211
Okay, okay, let's step into
the footprints, please.

797
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:53,858
Let's try this.

798
00:53:55,526 --> 00:53:57,654
Standing in this circle as a team,

799
00:53:57,724 --> 00:54:00,415
You can easily connect
to the morphin' grid.

800
00:54:00,702 --> 00:54:01,581
Do you feel it?

801
00:54:01,704 --> 00:54:02,704
Yeah they do.

802
00:54:02,864 --> 00:54:04,594
No, not feeling it.

803
00:54:04,819 --> 00:54:07,044
You need to morph to get your armor.

804
00:54:07,817 --> 00:54:09,894
I knew it! We do get armor.

805
00:54:09,941 --> 00:54:12,852
Jason! We get armor!

806
00:54:13,056 --> 00:54:15,054
Cool! When you give us the armor?

807
00:54:15,143 --> 00:54:16,927
You already have it inside of you.

808
00:54:17,114 --> 00:54:19,492
You bring it out by
connecting to each other.

809
00:54:19,582 --> 00:54:21,424
And connecting to the Morphing grid.

810
00:54:21,859 --> 00:54:24,558
Bury your minds and focus.

811
00:54:25,267 --> 00:54:30,433
Power Rangers were a legion of
warriors sworn to protect life.

812
00:54:30,533 --> 00:54:31,339
Yes!

813
00:54:31,486 --> 00:54:34,229
They must become those warriors.

814
00:54:34,328 --> 00:54:35,973
Become the warriors!

815
00:54:45,493 --> 00:54:46,493
What?

816
00:54:46,525 --> 00:54:48,026
What? Did It worked?

817
00:54:48,202 --> 00:54:50,261
Alpha 5, why they didn't they morph?

818
00:54:50,331 --> 00:54:52,801
I do not know, sir.
It is disturbing.

819
00:54:53,024 --> 00:54:55,653
Very disturbing.
Might take some time.

820
00:54:55,899 --> 00:54:57,223
We don't have time!

821
00:54:57,526 --> 00:54:59,709
If they can't morph,
what are we supposed to do?

822
00:54:59,815 --> 00:55:02,549
They will have to train without
armor, they need to prepare.

823
00:55:02,792 --> 00:55:06,051
Without armor?
Sir that will be very painful,

824
00:55:06,203 --> 00:55:08,065
Take them down to the pit.

825
00:55:09,583 --> 00:55:12,109
Alright, follow me.
We are going to the pit!

826
00:55:12,252 --> 00:55:14,114
Jason I don't want to find out
what the pit is.

827
00:55:14,375 --> 00:55:17,050
So, This is the pit.
It's nice, right?

828
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:19,352
Alpha 5, begin the exercise.

829
00:55:19,547 --> 00:55:20,291
Sorry, guys.

830
00:55:20,491 --> 00:55:22,322
- What exercise?
- Chill out dude.

831
00:55:27,043 --> 00:55:31,142
These creatures before you
are simulations of Rita's army.

832
00:55:31,198 --> 00:55:34,598
They are called... to get to her.

833
00:55:34,837 --> 00:55:36,241
No, no, no, Jason.

834
00:55:36,577 --> 00:55:39,284
Relax, guys. It's a hologram.

835
00:55:39,595 --> 00:55:41,481
Like video games. Look.

836
00:55:43,806 --> 00:55:45,767
Strong ass hologram.

837
00:55:46,568 --> 00:55:48,006
Not a video game.

838
00:55:48,302 --> 00:55:50,805
This is why you must
morph into your armor.

839
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:53,621
If Rita becomes strong enough
to build her army...

840
00:55:53,779 --> 00:55:56,029
The real beginning of the end.

841
00:55:56,334 --> 00:55:58,667
Rangers Welcome to training.

842
00:55:58,903 --> 00:56:00,711
I'm so excited you guys are back.

843
00:56:01,218 --> 00:56:02,627
Aim for the center..

844
00:56:03,358 --> 00:56:04,365
Once more time.

845
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:06,933
Dodging their punches.
Find their weak site.

846
00:56:08,446 --> 00:56:10,912
Let's go a couple of hits. Okay?

847
00:56:11,174 --> 00:56:12,174
No let's try that again.

848
00:56:12,364 --> 00:56:13,364
This is exciting.

849
00:56:15,022 --> 00:56:16,022
Yeah, Trini!

850
00:56:18,819 --> 00:56:20,034
Ready, master Billy?

851
00:56:21,818 --> 00:56:24,600
You need to learn the
element of surprise.

852
00:56:25,039 --> 00:56:26,808
- Ready? Let's go again.
- Okay.

853
00:56:26,976 --> 00:56:28,832
Billy, light on your feet.

854
00:56:30,246 --> 00:56:31,246
Hands up.

855
00:56:41,602 --> 00:56:43,976
Play with some energy now! let's go!

856
00:56:48,105 --> 00:56:50,944
Focus! focus everybody just focus!

857
00:56:54,156 --> 00:56:55,581
Lucky shot.

858
00:56:57,965 --> 00:57:00,247
You guys all know
you can be murdered, right?

859
00:57:13,836 --> 00:57:14,836
No.

860
00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:22,744
You must shade your own mask
to wear this armor.

861
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:25,139
I don't feel anything!

862
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:26,389
No.

863
00:57:26,444 --> 00:57:28,010
Take them down to the pit.

864
00:57:28,232 --> 00:57:29,232
Watch me.

865
00:57:29,454 --> 00:57:31,956
Slip, grab, lift!

866
00:57:32,746 --> 00:57:33,994
Yeah!

867
00:57:34,142 --> 00:57:36,119
Slip, grab, lift!

868
00:57:38,278 --> 00:57:39,278
Yes!

869
00:57:53,579 --> 00:57:55,350
<b><i>We SHOULD start a band</i></b>

870
00:57:57,949 --> 00:58:02,558
Think only of each other and the
morphing grid will open to you.

871
00:58:03,424 --> 00:58:04,468
It's working?

872
00:58:04,797 --> 00:58:06,745
- No, it's not.
- Come on!

873
00:58:06,889 --> 00:58:07,889
Try harder!

874
00:58:10,417 --> 00:58:12,028
I have been concentrated though.

875
00:58:12,328 --> 00:58:14,605
All we need to do is
just concentrate...

876
00:58:14,845 --> 00:58:17,274
- Don't tell me to concentrate.
- Just follow my lead.

877
00:58:17,469 --> 00:58:20,327
- Let's not fight with each other.
- Now is not the time.

878
00:58:23,472 --> 00:58:25,556
Come on. let's go to train.

879
00:58:26,733 --> 00:58:28,974
The information we need
to triangulate the location of...

880
00:58:29,138 --> 00:58:31,945
The Crystal was lost in the battle.

881
00:58:32,153 --> 00:58:33,553
Billy Are you listening to me?

882
00:58:34,069 --> 00:58:35,327
Billy What are you doing?

883
00:58:35,581 --> 00:58:36,581
Billy!

884
00:58:37,463 --> 00:58:40,856
Where is the crystal
Find him, Billy, find him.

885
00:58:41,426 --> 00:58:42,993
Where is the crystal?

886
00:58:43,534 --> 00:58:44,534
There.

887
00:58:44,816 --> 00:58:47,672
17 degrees north...

888
00:58:47,974 --> 00:58:49,761
Hey, idiot,
watch where you're going.

889
00:58:57,224 --> 00:58:58,711
Krispy Kreme DOUGHNUTS

890
00:58:58,812 --> 00:59:02,417
Two fishermen were led to rest
today at St Andrews cemetery.

891
00:59:02,518 --> 00:59:05,163
Residents of Angel Grove
are feeling the shock.

892
00:59:05,364 --> 00:59:07,432
Fear has the town on edge.

893
00:59:07,733 --> 00:59:10,683
The series of murders
has police baffled...

894
00:59:10,883 --> 00:59:13,546
as police have linked the loss
of gold to each crime scene.

895
00:59:13,922 --> 00:59:18,232
What is now being Angel Grove's
gold killer is still on the loose/.

896
00:59:18,333 --> 00:59:20,508
If Rita manages to create Goldar...

897
00:59:20,909 --> 00:59:22,189
Are you listening to me?

898
00:59:22,259 --> 00:59:24,393
And he rips the crystal
from the ground..

899
00:59:24,494 --> 00:59:27,894
..It will be like ten thousand
nuclear bombs washing over earth.

900
00:59:28,095 --> 00:59:29,386
That supposed to freak us out?

901
00:59:29,486 --> 00:59:31,678
We keep making this harder.
We are busting our asses,

902
00:59:31,879 --> 00:59:33,035
Feel free to throw us
a bone at some point.

903
00:59:33,036 --> 00:59:35,783
Yes, I see you busting your asses.

904
00:59:36,034 --> 00:59:38,053
So I've decided to give
you some inspiration.

905
00:59:38,555 --> 00:59:42,330
What you will find beyond this wall
will forever change your life.

906
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,148
Come on.

907
00:59:48,485 --> 00:59:51,631
- The Zords! Pretty cool, right?
- Yeah.

908
00:59:51,831 --> 00:59:54,967
They take on the form of most
powerful organism on the planet.

909
00:59:55,168 --> 00:59:59,103
When these Zords formed,
dinosaurs reigned supreme.

910
00:59:59,204 --> 01:00:01,316
They will be an extension of you.

911
01:00:01,817 --> 01:00:05,450
And there power is
all but limitless.

912
01:00:07,729 --> 01:00:08,943
They are incredible.

913
01:00:09,143 --> 01:00:11,320
But you are not
ready for this power.

914
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:15,306
When you morph, your armor
will make you one with the zords.

915
01:00:15,506 --> 01:00:17,247
Come on. Let's go train.

916
01:00:17,346 --> 01:00:19,544
Today is the day you become Rangers!

917
01:00:19,645 --> 01:00:20,992
I can feel it!

918
01:00:22,748 --> 01:00:23,601
Okay.

919
01:00:23,701 --> 01:00:24,803
Let's go.

920
01:00:24,902 --> 01:00:25,902
Yeah.

921
01:00:26,538 --> 01:00:27,740
Let's go.

922
01:00:35,055 --> 01:00:37,277
This was a bad idea. Okay, okay.

923
01:00:37,378 --> 01:00:39,791
Signals, brakes.
Brakes, I need the brakes!

924
01:00:39,892 --> 01:00:41,491
Manual. Manual.

925
01:00:41,691 --> 01:00:44,868
Where are the breaks. Alpha 5?

926
01:00:47,740 --> 01:00:50,795
Oh, God hey, Move! Move!

927
01:00:50,998 --> 01:00:52,085
Out of the way!

928
01:00:53,955 --> 01:00:57,824
Oh, Tailing on the mountain.

929
01:00:59,735 --> 01:01:03,160
After you remember that today's train
lesson the important thing is to...

930
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:04,760
Wait. Where is Zack?

931
01:01:04,862 --> 01:01:05,862
Seriously?

932
01:01:08,604 --> 01:01:11,383
Run, run! Run!

933
01:01:11,937 --> 01:01:14,155
Run! Run!

934
01:01:16,662 --> 01:01:18,397
It's bad!

935
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:26,790
You're alright?

936
01:01:31,504 --> 01:01:34,505
Alright, my bad, my bad.
That's on me right there.

937
01:01:34,608 --> 01:01:35,683
What's your problem?

938
01:01:35,753 --> 01:01:37,902
You could've killed yourself,
or us.

939
01:01:38,003 --> 01:01:39,764
- Back off, boss.
- Hey!

940
01:01:40,333 --> 01:01:42,289
No, Come on guys. Wow.

941
01:01:42,688 --> 01:01:44,809
- Guys, guys, come on.
- Watch it.

942
01:01:44,912 --> 01:01:46,352
Wait. What are you doing?

943
01:01:50,763 --> 01:01:52,500
Stop fighting, please!

944
01:02:01,071 --> 01:02:02,151
What?

945
01:02:03,323 --> 01:02:04,821
Stand still.

946
01:02:05,221 --> 01:02:07,089
What? I got something on my face...?

947
01:02:07,490 --> 01:02:08,590
Yeah!

948
01:02:09,691 --> 01:02:12,288
- Ok, now that's cool!
- Oh, Yeah!

949
01:02:12,487 --> 01:02:14,220
Don't touch it.
Zack, don't touch it.

950
01:02:14,290 --> 01:02:15,252
Zack, do not touch.

951
01:02:19,264 --> 01:02:20,282
Where'd it go?

952
01:02:20,382 --> 01:02:22,668
Bring it back, bring it back, dude.

953
01:02:23,037 --> 01:02:24,128
Get out.

954
01:02:24,327 --> 01:02:27,887
The training is over for today.
Go home.

955
01:02:27,987 --> 01:02:31,334
I'm sorry, he just morphed.
He did it. You saw it, right?

956
01:02:31,435 --> 01:02:33,507
Do it again. All of you.

957
01:02:35,109 --> 01:02:38,390
- Billy, how'd you do that?
- Come on, Billy, let's do it.

958
01:02:38,490 --> 01:02:40,050
Come on, do it again.

959
01:02:43,096 --> 01:02:46,121
- Do it again.
- I'm trying. I can't focus

960
01:02:46,974 --> 01:02:49,038
Billy, how'd you do it? Show us.

961
01:02:50,893 --> 01:02:52,665
Okay, we don't know how.

962
01:02:52,767 --> 01:02:54,066
That's what I thought.

963
01:02:54,167 --> 01:02:57,834
If you can't morph,
You are not Rangers.

964
01:02:58,035 --> 01:03:00,128
Go home, all of you.

965
01:03:01,844 --> 01:03:02,960
Now what?

966
01:03:03,364 --> 01:03:05,189
- Got damn!
- Seriously?

967
01:03:13,152 --> 01:03:14,232
Hey, guys.

968
01:03:14,432 --> 01:03:17,806
Guys.
Look, I'mma stay up here tonight.

969
01:03:17,908 --> 01:03:21,850
Make a fire, I got some food.
If you guys wanna stay

970
01:03:23,429 --> 01:03:24,429
I'm down.

971
01:03:26,021 --> 01:03:27,021
Alright.

972
01:03:27,104 --> 01:03:28,104
Cool.

973
01:03:28,303 --> 01:03:30,633
Jason's failing experiment.

974
01:03:30,833 --> 01:03:32,686
I shall destroy Rita myself.

975
01:03:32,889 --> 01:03:35,389
There must be a way to
free me from this wall.

976
01:03:35,490 --> 01:03:40,027
Yes, but the irony is that
you need these rangers to morph.

977
01:03:40,229 --> 01:03:42,421
If they morph,
you can harness that energy...

978
01:03:42,422 --> 01:03:44,740
to regenerate your body
and come back through.

979
01:03:44,842 --> 01:03:46,990
No, there's got to another way!
I can't...

980
01:03:47,192 --> 01:03:49,593
What, Zordon? You can't what?

981
01:03:49,753 --> 01:03:53,236
Wait for us dumb kids to morph
so that you can come back to life.

982
01:03:53,398 --> 01:03:55,136
That's what all this has been about,
right?

983
01:03:55,737 --> 01:03:57,002
You coming back?

984
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:59,879
This has only ever been about
to protecting the crystal

985
01:04:00,081 --> 01:04:02,139
Rita could be building
Goldar as we speak.

986
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:04,171
Don't underestimate me or my team.

987
01:04:04,271 --> 01:04:05,601
You can't stop him..

988
01:04:06,002 --> 01:04:10,505
She will have him dig up the crystal
and life on earth..will die.

989
01:04:10,903 --> 01:04:12,023
And we need you.

990
01:04:12,624 --> 01:04:15,210
Because you were so successful
in stopping her last time.

991
01:04:15,412 --> 01:04:17,983
I died burying those coins...

992
01:04:18,184 --> 01:04:21,721
In hopes they will
find next real Rangers.

993
01:04:22,030 --> 01:04:23,618
Those who are worthy.

994
01:04:23,818 --> 01:04:25,571
I'm sorry to disappoint you!

995
01:04:25,672 --> 01:04:28,306
I don't need to stand here and
have you tell me what I did wrong.

996
01:04:28,507 --> 01:04:29,811
I can go home and get that.

997
01:04:29,914 --> 01:04:33,700
Jason! You need me out of this wall.

998
01:04:33,902 --> 01:04:35,750
To help lead this team!

999
01:04:36,049 --> 01:04:37,480
Your team is dead.

1000
01:04:38,326 --> 01:04:40,612
And you're just as scared as we are.

1001
01:04:46,747 --> 01:04:51,047
These are off 24 carat Gold.

1002
01:04:51,448 --> 01:04:52,472
I'll be right with you.

1003
01:05:00,343 --> 01:05:01,987
You're so sweet.

1004
01:05:05,573 --> 01:05:07,568
I'll be right back.

1005
01:05:11,534 --> 01:05:12,906
Can I help you?

1006
01:05:14,128 --> 01:05:15,128
Gold.

1007
01:05:16,377 --> 01:05:18,414
I'm interested...

1008
01:05:19,039 --> 01:05:20,170
gold.

1009
01:05:21,021 --> 01:05:22,021
Yeah.

1010
01:05:27,027 --> 01:05:29,962
We have some very nice pieces here.

1011
01:05:45,017 --> 01:05:46,253
Come closer.

1012
01:05:46,348 --> 01:05:49,105
Closer, closer. Closer.

1013
01:05:55,953 --> 01:05:57,037
This.

1014
01:05:57,446 --> 01:05:58,745
Give it to me!

1015
01:05:58,948 --> 01:06:00,369
Okay. There you go.

1016
01:06:10,167 --> 01:06:11,167
Grow.

1017
01:06:12,579 --> 01:06:14,035
Grow.

1018
01:06:22,394 --> 01:06:23,796
Police! Don't move!

1019
01:06:24,258 --> 01:06:28,669
Drop it, weapon, put your hands
on your head. Do it Now!

1020
01:06:28,771 --> 01:06:30,015
Do it, I say, lady!

1021
01:06:30,116 --> 01:06:31,215
Lady?

1022
01:06:31,617 --> 01:06:33,846
I like the sound of lady.

1023
01:06:33,964 --> 01:06:36,171
Get on the ground and
you won't get hurt.

1024
01:06:48,069 --> 01:06:50,656
Unit 5,
I need backup at Jewelers Phoenix.

1025
01:06:50,798 --> 01:06:53,097
Shots were fired.
I repeat, shots were fired.

1026
01:06:54,347 --> 01:06:55,347
Down!

1027
01:07:04,042 --> 01:07:07,604
It's been too long since
I raised my beautiful creatures.

1028
01:07:09,972 --> 01:07:11,910
Did you miss me?

1029
01:07:20,606 --> 01:07:21,989
Oh my God.

1030
01:07:22,188 --> 01:07:23,588
Kill him.

1031
01:07:28,043 --> 01:07:29,356
- Alright.
- Ha-ha.

1032
01:07:29,658 --> 01:07:33,101
"How we are stuck in this wall
I will make that jump."

1033
01:07:35,287 --> 01:07:36,641
What happened back there?

1034
01:07:36,842 --> 01:07:39,134
Nothing, don't worry about it.

1035
01:07:42,087 --> 01:07:43,530
Billy, how'd you do it?

1036
01:07:44,741 --> 01:07:46,177
How'd you morph?

1037
01:07:46,843 --> 01:07:47,843
I don't know.

1038
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:50,959
What do you guys saying him about
one more trying to morph?

1039
01:07:51,161 --> 01:07:55,052
"You must shade your masks
to wear this armor."

1040
01:07:56,886 --> 01:08:01,578
"Think only of each other and the
morphin' grid will open to you".

1041
01:08:01,579 --> 01:08:02,970
Yeah, that's better.

1042
01:08:03,742 --> 01:08:06,337
Or maybe it's Cause we
don't know each other.

1043
01:08:06,407 --> 01:08:08,294
Maybe that's why we can't morph.

1044
01:08:10,499 --> 01:08:11,499
Okay.

1045
01:08:11,962 --> 01:08:15,481
No, I am serious,
let's do this for real

1046
01:08:16,082 --> 01:08:19,605
I am Jack and I am a Power Ranger.

1047
01:08:21,900 --> 01:08:23,967
- Hi, Zack.
- Hi, Zack.

1048
01:08:24,554 --> 01:08:25,554
True

1049
01:08:25,899 --> 01:08:29,126
I live in the Melody
mobile home park.

1050
01:08:29,326 --> 01:08:31,074
It's just me and my mum.

1051
01:08:31,674 --> 01:08:32,852
And my mom?

1052
01:08:33,552 --> 01:08:35,609
My mom is the best!

1053
01:08:39,717 --> 01:08:41,878
But my Mom. she's sick.

1054
01:08:42,629 --> 01:08:44,239
I do what I can...

1055
01:08:45,515 --> 01:08:46,883
but I'm scared.

1056
01:08:47,380 --> 01:08:50,541
Sometimes I get too
scared to stay the night

1057
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:54,219
because I'm afraid she can't make it.

1058
01:08:56,291 --> 01:08:57,867
And if she goes...

1059
01:08:59,745 --> 01:09:01,201
When she goes...

1060
01:09:02,952 --> 01:09:04,609
I got nobody else.

1061
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:09,799
Look.

1062
01:09:10,678 --> 01:09:13,104
I think being with you
guys is good for me.

1063
01:09:15,736 --> 01:09:16,446
Let's do that.

1064
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:19,452
Let's tell our secrets
it will help us.

1065
01:09:20,139 --> 01:09:21,743
Okay, I got a secret.

1066
01:09:22,784 --> 01:09:25,149
- I like country music.
- What?

1067
01:09:25,494 --> 01:09:27,646
As a matter of fact,
I love country music.

1068
01:09:29,642 --> 01:09:30,728
And I don't...

1069
01:09:31,912 --> 01:09:33,712
I don't miss my dad that much

1070
01:09:36,045 --> 01:09:38,467
I mean coming to the mine
with him was all I had.

1071
01:09:39,550 --> 01:09:43,557
But.. coming to the mine with
you guys is just as good.

1072
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:45,960
Yeah.

1073
01:09:46,005 --> 01:09:48,284
Biggest secret is
why're you in detention.

1074
01:09:48,470 --> 01:09:50,532
- I blew up my lunch box.
- What?

1075
01:09:50,658 --> 01:09:52,152
But it was an accident.

1076
01:09:52,368 --> 01:09:53,871
- What?
- Of course.

1077
01:09:54,158 --> 01:09:55,416
My lunch box was in my locker

1078
01:09:55,417 --> 01:09:57,948
boom goes the lunch box,
in detention goes Billy.

1079
01:09:58,311 --> 01:10:00,396
But let's not forget
that Kimberly Hart

1080
01:10:00,466 --> 01:10:02,221
was also in detention too so...

1081
01:10:05,077 --> 01:10:06,077
Not tonight.

1082
01:10:07,599 --> 01:10:08,641
Skip me.

1083
01:10:12,283 --> 01:10:13,390
What about you dude?

1084
01:10:13,946 --> 01:10:16,105
Why don't you tell us
who you really are?

1085
01:10:16,259 --> 01:10:18,598
Because everyone knows
exactly who I am.

1086
01:10:19,066 --> 01:10:20,193
Okay.

1087
01:10:21,159 --> 01:10:22,727
What about you, crazy girl?

1088
01:10:22,849 --> 01:10:25,471
I could tell you anything and
you would have to believe me.

1089
01:10:30,515 --> 01:10:31,515
Okay.

1090
01:10:32,808 --> 01:10:34,179
I'm the new girl.

1091
01:10:34,676 --> 01:10:35,900
Always.

1092
01:10:37,593 --> 01:10:39,616
Three schools in three years.

1093
01:10:41,805 --> 01:10:44,730
I like it that way, you know,
it's just easier.

1094
01:10:44,937 --> 01:10:47,225
Nobody ever has to get to know me...

1095
01:10:47,542 --> 01:10:51,063
my parents don't have to worry
about my relationships.

1096
01:10:52,644 --> 01:10:54,028
Boyfriend troubles?

1097
01:10:54,261 --> 01:10:55,261
Yeah.

1098
01:10:56,360 --> 01:10:58,036
Boyfriend troubles.

1099
01:11:01,024 --> 01:11:02,454
Girlfriend troubles.?

1100
01:11:08,515 --> 01:11:11,059
My family is so normal.

1101
01:11:12,006 --> 01:11:13,253
Too normal.

1102
01:11:16,037 --> 01:11:17,938
They believe in labels.

1103
01:11:20,023 --> 01:11:22,273
They would like for me to...

1104
01:11:23,372 --> 01:11:24,751
dress differently.

1105
01:11:25,970 --> 01:11:27,285
Talk more.

1106
01:11:29,448 --> 01:11:31,820
Have the kinds of friends
they want me to have.

1107
01:11:34,133 --> 01:11:37,266
I don't know how to tell them
what's really going on with me.

1108
01:11:42,234 --> 01:11:44,741
I never said any of this out loud.

1109
01:11:44,983 --> 01:11:47,901
Well, it's cool. You with us now.

1110
01:11:50,687 --> 01:11:51,687
Am I?

1111
01:11:53,276 --> 01:11:54,542
What does that mean?

1112
01:11:55,154 --> 01:11:56,831
When all this is over?

1113
01:11:57,693 --> 01:11:59,555
Are we Power Rangers or?

1114
01:12:02,157 --> 01:12:04,313
Are we friends?

1115
01:12:32,964 --> 01:12:34,374
Do you know who I am?

1116
01:12:36,525 --> 01:12:37,567
Yes.

1117
01:12:38,769 --> 01:12:41,152
I was once just like you.

1118
01:12:42,233 --> 01:12:44,739
So pretty.

1119
01:12:45,324 --> 01:12:46,846
Innocent.

1120
01:12:47,298 --> 01:12:51,405
Are all the rangers on Zordan's
new team as young as you?

1121
01:12:53,454 --> 01:12:54,796
Delightful!

1122
01:12:56,303 --> 01:12:57,837
Have you morphed yet?

1123
01:13:00,314 --> 01:13:02,197
Trick question.

1124
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:03,892
If you could morph,

1125
01:13:03,962 --> 01:13:07,732
we would be having a very
different conversation.

1126
01:13:09,740 --> 01:13:11,823
The Yellow Ranger.

1127
01:13:13,202 --> 01:13:14,770
Should I kill you?

1128
01:13:15,438 --> 01:13:18,793
I killed the yellow Ranger before.

1129
01:13:19,674 --> 01:13:21,397
And I loved it!

1130
01:13:21,752 --> 01:13:24,036
Oh, you want your armor.

1131
01:13:24,344 --> 01:13:28,417
I'll show you mine
if you show me yours.

1132
01:13:43,285 --> 01:13:45,455
No, please, you're hurting me.

1133
01:13:45,531 --> 01:13:46,836
You are so strong!

1134
01:13:49,219 --> 01:13:50,883
I'm just kidding.

1135
01:13:52,524 --> 01:13:55,038
You've guts full, little yellow!

1136
01:13:55,294 --> 01:13:56,746
I see myself in you.

1137
01:13:57,024 --> 01:14:00,640
I was an outsider on Zordan's team,
just like you.

1138
01:14:01,485 --> 01:14:03,656
All I need to know is...

1139
01:14:04,167 --> 01:14:06,007
where is the Zeo Crystal.

1140
01:14:06,073 --> 01:14:07,966
I don't know.

1141
01:14:08,757 --> 01:14:10,454
Sadly, I believe you.

1142
01:14:10,903 --> 01:14:14,179
Tomorrow I am going to
destroy Angel Grove.

1143
01:14:14,513 --> 01:14:17,179
But in exchange for your life...

1144
01:14:17,423 --> 01:14:21,177
you will find out where that
crystal is and you will come to me.

1145
01:14:21,340 --> 01:14:25,017
We can have a little deal,
Didi my friend.

1146
01:14:38,379 --> 01:14:39,941
- Kim!
- It's me.

1147
01:14:41,005 --> 01:14:42,595
How did you get in here?

1148
01:14:42,933 --> 01:14:46,426
I am a super hero.
And you left your window open.

1149
01:14:46,619 --> 01:14:47,619
So everything okay?

1150
01:14:49,129 --> 01:14:51,757
I think I'm the
reason we can't morph.

1151
01:14:53,730 --> 01:14:55,371
I haven't really been honest.

1152
01:14:55,595 --> 01:14:56,595
Okay.

1153
01:14:56,651 --> 01:14:58,752
I punched Ty Fleming on the face...

1154
01:14:58,843 --> 01:15:01,920
because he told everyone I was
the meanest person he ever met.

1155
01:15:02,770 --> 01:15:03,770
And he was right.

1156
01:15:04,203 --> 01:15:06,192
- That cannot be true.
- Okay.

1157
01:15:08,503 --> 01:15:09,503
Whoa!

1158
01:15:09,612 --> 01:15:11,331
- Yeah.
- You took that picture?

1159
01:15:11,558 --> 01:15:14,937
No. Amanda Clark,
took that picture, of herself.

1160
01:15:15,453 --> 01:15:18,127
But she shared it with me privately.

1161
01:15:18,883 --> 01:15:20,144
She trusted me.

1162
01:15:20,231 --> 01:15:22,604
And you sent that pic to Ty?

1163
01:15:23,017 --> 01:15:24,561
With a text that said.

1164
01:15:24,965 --> 01:15:27,202
"Is this the girl you wanna
bring home to your mom?"

1165
01:15:29,184 --> 01:15:32,219
I did not know how mean
it was until I saw her face.

1166
01:15:32,271 --> 01:15:35,141
Kim, there is literally thousands
of photos going around school

1167
01:15:35,366 --> 01:15:37,641
I don't care about them.
I care about this

1168
01:15:37,988 --> 01:15:39,338
I did this!

1169
01:15:39,469 --> 01:15:42,439
I had to sit in Mr. Detmer's office
with Amanda's father...

1170
01:15:42,507 --> 01:15:45,038
and watched as they showed him
the photo of his daughter.

1171
01:15:47,124 --> 01:15:50,536
In his eyes for the first time
I could see who I would become.

1172
01:15:50,902 --> 01:15:54,456
You know, So I lied.
I blamed everyone else.

1173
01:15:55,891 --> 01:15:57,639
I wanted to die, that's why...

1174
01:15:57,778 --> 01:16:00,752
When you asked me to run away,
I was ready.

1175
01:16:00,998 --> 01:16:02,130
Okay, listen.

1176
01:16:02,424 --> 01:16:04,846
Start over.
Erase that picture right now.

1177
01:16:04,966 --> 01:16:07,574
- Jason, it can't be erased.
- Then live with it!

1178
01:16:07,827 --> 01:16:10,947
You did an awful thing, that
does not make you a awful person.

1179
01:16:15,086 --> 01:16:17,068
Just be the person
you wanna be.

1180
01:16:27,810 --> 01:16:30,713
So we all get the same text.
So where is she?

1181
01:16:33,939 --> 01:16:34,961
I'm here!

1182
01:16:37,142 --> 01:16:38,142
Look.

1183
01:16:38,336 --> 01:16:40,043
Rita came to my house tonight.

1184
01:16:40,329 --> 01:16:41,947
- What?
- Yeah, she's real.

1185
01:16:43,012 --> 01:16:44,012
Insane.

1186
01:16:44,948 --> 01:16:46,346
She nearly killed me.

1187
01:16:47,331 --> 01:16:50,545
She's trying to get me to join her.
She said she'd spare my life

1188
01:16:50,730 --> 01:16:52,668
- if kept a secret.
- What secret?

1189
01:16:52,762 --> 01:16:55,730
Act on the destruction of
Angel Grove begins.

1190
01:16:55,866 --> 01:16:59,016
- This is real. This is the end.
- No, it's not. Where is she?

1191
01:16:59,201 --> 01:17:01,206
She said to me hear
what the dead ships live.

1192
01:17:01,431 --> 01:17:03,667
That's the boatyard by the docks,
right?

1193
01:17:03,846 --> 01:17:04,846
Let's go!

1194
01:17:10,572 --> 01:17:11,853
Are you serious?

1195
01:17:12,307 --> 01:17:12,637
No one?

1196
01:17:12,707 --> 01:17:14,832
Jason. We are not even
power rangers yet.

1197
01:17:15,006 --> 01:17:16,444
I say we go back to Zordon.

1198
01:17:16,712 --> 01:17:20,293
Hey.. The only reason Zordon
wanted us to become Power Rangers...

1199
01:17:20,468 --> 01:17:21,992
Is so that he can come back to life.

1200
01:17:22,231 --> 01:17:23,322
Why makes you say that?

1201
01:17:23,562 --> 01:17:24,646
Because he told me.

1202
01:17:25,029 --> 01:17:28,552
- Wait, so all this a lie?
- Of course it was a lie, Billy.

1203
01:17:28,969 --> 01:17:30,015
We failed.

1204
01:17:30,230 --> 01:17:32,967
Let's stop being delusional about
being a team of superheroes.

1205
01:17:33,870 --> 01:17:35,879
We are all screw-ups.

1206
01:17:36,636 --> 01:17:39,631
And as much as I hate this
scrubby bullshit town...

1207
01:17:40,403 --> 01:17:43,028
I don't wanna just sit around
and watch it die okay?

1208
01:17:44,091 --> 01:17:45,758
Let's go and do the one this

1209
01:17:45,828 --> 01:17:48,091
that's been asked of
us and kill Rita.

1210
01:17:51,889 --> 01:17:54,451
You know this is really
a bad idea, right?

1211
01:17:54,592 --> 01:17:55,592
The worst.

1212
01:17:56,668 --> 01:17:57,795
Let's vote.

1213
01:17:58,570 --> 01:17:59,717
Shove hands.

1214
01:18:16,202 --> 01:18:17,544
Let's do it.

1215
01:18:46,903 --> 01:18:47,903
Okay.

1216
01:18:48,298 --> 01:18:49,298
Okay.

1217
01:18:50,116 --> 01:18:51,368
Let's go.

1218
01:18:54,016 --> 01:18:56,511
- take the left, take the right.
- Got it.

1219
01:19:02,283 --> 01:19:03,362
We'll untie. Hold it.

1220
01:19:03,432 --> 01:19:05,745
No no.
Let's just think about this, okay?

1221
01:19:06,591 --> 01:19:07,628
Oh shit.

1222
01:19:12,565 --> 01:19:14,546
Right on time.

1223
01:19:15,240 --> 01:19:17,679
I was beginning to
think you were too dumb

1224
01:19:17,749 --> 01:19:19,831
to know where the dead ships live.

1225
01:19:22,231 --> 01:19:23,818
Let's play.

1226
01:19:49,409 --> 01:19:53,753
Five little Rangers
tied up like fish.

1227
01:19:55,666 --> 01:19:57,119
The Leader?

1228
01:19:58,903 --> 01:20:00,091
Hello, Red.

1229
01:20:03,011 --> 01:20:05,694
You're not entirely disappointing.

1230
01:20:06,457 --> 01:20:10,588
Look at you, trying to figure out
my plan. I will just tell you.

1231
01:20:10,767 --> 01:20:14,284
Yellow has led you to your death.

1232
01:20:14,578 --> 01:20:17,117
Because I'm going to kill you...

1233
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:21,913
one by one, until you tell me...

1234
01:20:22,454 --> 01:20:23,874
Where's my crystal.

1235
01:20:24,025 --> 01:20:25,274
We don't know.

1236
01:20:25,362 --> 01:20:26,395
No, Red.

1237
01:20:27,032 --> 01:20:28,742
You don't know!

1238
01:20:28,914 --> 01:20:30,278
But guess what.

1239
01:20:30,494 --> 01:20:32,196
One of you does.

1240
01:20:33,324 --> 01:20:34,857
Who could it be?

1241
01:20:35,523 --> 01:20:38,196
Eeinie meenie mynie...

1242
01:20:38,797 --> 01:20:39,797
Blue.

1243
01:20:42,068 --> 01:20:45,233
Blue... so loyal.

1244
01:20:45,462 --> 01:20:46,527
Pure of heart.

1245
01:20:46,778 --> 01:20:49,591
Tell the class what you know!

1246
01:20:49,862 --> 01:20:51,397
Where is my crystal?

1247
01:20:53,954 --> 01:20:56,675
You can tell me now, Blue.

1248
01:20:56,774 --> 01:21:00,605
Or you can tell me after
I kill all of your friends.

1249
01:21:02,035 --> 01:21:03,767
- Let's start with Black.
- No!

1250
01:21:04,020 --> 01:21:05,909
Hey! no!

1251
01:21:06,411 --> 01:21:07,479
No.

1252
01:21:09,220 --> 01:21:11,080
He dies in three...

1253
01:21:11,686 --> 01:21:12,722
two...

1254
01:21:14,236 --> 01:21:15,545
Okay, okay!

1255
01:21:16,506 --> 01:21:18,381
Don't hurt my friends, alright?

1256
01:21:18,619 --> 01:21:20,175
It's at doughnut establishment.

1257
01:21:20,381 --> 01:21:23,039
Where? What does that mean?
What's it called?

1258
01:21:24,068 --> 01:21:25,315
It's a Krispy Kreme.

1259
01:21:25,381 --> 01:21:26,381
Krispy Kreme?

1260
01:21:26,576 --> 01:21:29,386
Krispy Kreme.
This is a special place?

1261
01:21:29,604 --> 01:21:31,196
- Very Special.
- It Must be.

1262
01:21:31,481 --> 01:21:34,133
The Source of life
itself is buried there.

1263
01:21:34,429 --> 01:21:37,564
Thank you Blue for being so weak.

1264
01:21:37,773 --> 01:21:41,800
Zordon will lose all respect for me
If I don't kill you.

1265
01:21:42,570 --> 01:21:44,293
- At least one of you.
- What?

1266
01:21:46,404 --> 01:21:47,404
No!

1267
01:21:49,243 --> 01:21:50,243
Billy!

1268
01:21:51,265 --> 01:21:52,265
Billy! Billy!

1269
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:54,559
- Jason, we gotta help him.
- Billy!

1270
01:21:54,755 --> 01:21:55,755
Billy!

1271
01:21:59,743 --> 01:22:01,865
You are not ready to kill me.

1272
01:22:02,936 --> 01:22:05,074
You are not worthy.

1273
01:22:10,573 --> 01:22:11,982
Give me your hand!

1274
01:22:24,189 --> 01:22:26,241
- Billy?
- Is he gonna be okay, right?

1275
01:22:28,076 --> 01:22:29,076
Come on.

1276
01:22:29,311 --> 01:22:32,590
Hey hey. You can, spec guy Come on.

1277
01:22:34,290 --> 01:22:35,290
He's dead.

1278
01:22:44,123 --> 01:22:45,239
He is dead.

1279
01:22:46,093 --> 01:22:47,093
No.

1280
01:22:56,990 --> 01:22:59,205
We SHOULD start a band.

1281
01:23:04,061 --> 01:23:05,175
Pick him up.

1282
01:23:07,036 --> 01:23:08,734
Help me pick him up!

1283
01:23:11,383 --> 01:23:12,383
Come on!

1284
01:23:36,074 --> 01:23:37,600
It's okay. It's okay.

1285
01:23:37,836 --> 01:23:40,435
Come on, Billy. We got you, buddy.

1286
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:42,801
Take him, take him to the cave.

1287
01:23:44,899 --> 01:23:45,899
Yeah.

1288
01:24:06,303 --> 01:24:07,692
- Put him down.
- Okay.

1289
01:24:08,976 --> 01:24:10,681
- Slow slow.
- Master Billy.

1290
01:24:11,808 --> 01:24:13,134
Do something, ok?

1291
01:24:13,508 --> 01:24:15,188
There must be something
you can do for him.

1292
01:24:15,272 --> 01:24:17,619
I told you that you were not ready.

1293
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:21,029
Zordon please help us, okay? Please!

1294
01:24:21,675 --> 01:24:23,783
There is nothing that
I could do for him.

1295
01:24:24,850 --> 01:24:27,623
We were both reckless
with our teams.

1296
01:24:33,747 --> 01:24:34,920
No.

1297
01:24:37,947 --> 01:24:39,327
I am sorry.

1298
01:24:45,192 --> 01:24:46,704
I'm sorry, guys.

1299
01:24:48,527 --> 01:24:50,320
He's dead because of me.

1300
01:24:51,805 --> 01:24:53,595
No, Jason, it was all of us.

1301
01:24:53,775 --> 01:24:55,743
No I pushed it.

1302
01:24:56,049 --> 01:24:58,524
And as usual,
I made the wrong decision.

1303
01:24:58,754 --> 01:25:01,261
Out of fear, anger...

1304
01:25:02,665 --> 01:25:05,410
I don't know,
It's just so angry.

1305
01:25:08,076 --> 01:25:10,257
He's a great kid, you know.

1306
01:25:11,948 --> 01:25:13,527
And he loved us.

1307
01:25:13,732 --> 01:25:16,746
He loved being a Ranger.

1308
01:25:19,257 --> 01:25:20,849
I'm sorry, Billy.

1309
01:25:22,715 --> 01:25:25,113
I'll trade my life
for yours if I could.

1310
01:25:34,935 --> 01:25:37,356
Maybe he traded his life for us.

1311
01:25:38,265 --> 01:25:39,941
Yeah probably he did.

1312
01:25:46,288 --> 01:25:47,467
I would.

1313
01:25:50,401 --> 01:25:51,401
Me too.

1314
01:25:52,901 --> 01:25:54,839
Yeah me too.

1315
01:25:57,181 --> 01:25:58,247
Me too.

1316
01:26:01,559 --> 01:26:03,176
Just the four of us now.

1317
01:26:08,438 --> 01:26:09,783
The truth is...

1318
01:26:10,620 --> 01:26:13,062
whatever we've said to each other...

1319
01:26:13,798 --> 01:26:15,130
It does not matter.

1320
01:26:16,406 --> 01:26:17,541
This...

1321
01:26:17,862 --> 01:26:20,425
this is the only thing that matters.

1322
01:26:24,143 --> 01:26:25,143
She is right.

1323
01:26:30,893 --> 01:26:31,920
Zordon!

1324
01:26:32,050 --> 01:26:34,621
Zordon! Look at the Grid!
This is your time!

1325
01:26:34,946 --> 01:26:36,141
Do you see it?

1326
01:26:36,322 --> 01:26:38,045
The grid is open, step through!

1327
01:26:38,244 --> 01:26:39,396
Yes, I see it.

1328
01:26:40,124 --> 01:26:41,134
I see it.

1329
01:26:43,853 --> 01:26:45,323
Get through, Zordon!

1330
01:26:46,283 --> 01:26:48,345
- Hey!
- What's happening?

1331
01:26:48,694 --> 01:26:50,615
The Morphin' grid is open!

1332
01:26:51,639 --> 01:26:52,759
What's going on?

1333
01:27:02,794 --> 01:27:03,879
Zordon?

1334
01:27:05,112 --> 01:27:06,126
Master?

1335
01:27:08,125 --> 01:27:09,010
Where is he?

1336
01:27:09,132 --> 01:27:10,722
He must have stepped
through the grid!

1337
01:27:11,348 --> 01:27:12,706
Alpha where did he go?

1338
01:27:12,863 --> 01:27:14,428
I don't know where he is.

1339
01:27:17,492 --> 01:27:18,492
Zordan, what?

1340
01:27:19,029 --> 01:27:21,837
Why didn't you step through?
That was your only chance.

1341
01:27:22,003 --> 01:27:23,130
I know.

1342
01:27:23,966 --> 01:27:26,467
But only one can come back.

1343
01:27:31,530 --> 01:27:32,530
Oh my God.

1344
01:27:32,860 --> 01:27:33,860
Billy!

1345
01:27:36,732 --> 01:27:38,363
- Billy!
- Oh my God.!

1346
01:27:41,259 --> 01:27:42,259
Are you okay?

1347
01:27:47,074 --> 01:27:48,074
You're not dead?

1348
01:27:48,153 --> 01:27:49,086
- Yeah.
- No.

1349
01:27:49,135 --> 01:27:50,135
A little bit.

1350
01:27:50,233 --> 01:27:51,701
You guys bring me back to life.

1351
01:27:53,192 --> 01:27:54,779
I told you we were superheroes.

1352
01:27:56,034 --> 01:27:59,176
There can only be one Red Ranger.

1353
01:27:59,672 --> 01:28:03,209
Jason, this is your time.

1354
01:28:03,555 --> 01:28:06,085
This is your team.

1355
01:28:06,554 --> 01:28:07,554
Thank you.

1356
01:28:09,868 --> 01:28:11,417
That was incredible

1357
01:28:12,408 --> 01:28:13,736
I've seen my dad.

1358
01:28:29,198 --> 01:28:30,824
Welcome back, my friend.

1359
01:28:32,937 --> 01:28:34,828
We gottta go to Krispy Kreme,
Jason.

1360
01:28:34,898 --> 01:28:35,438
What?

1361
01:28:35,637 --> 01:28:36,945
Not for doughnuts.

1362
01:28:38,765 --> 01:28:40,865
Okay. Let's try this.

1363
01:28:42,086 --> 01:28:43,334
Thank you, Zordon.

1364
01:29:05,047 --> 01:29:06,598
It's morphin' time.

1365
01:30:36,700 --> 01:30:39,553
Come back to me, Goldar.

1366
01:30:40,913 --> 01:30:42,687
Came back.

1367
01:30:55,298 --> 01:30:56,298
Hold up.

1368
01:30:56,550 --> 01:30:57,550
Look.

1369
01:31:08,554 --> 01:31:10,664
Alright, let's do this.

1370
01:31:47,535 --> 01:31:48,535
Yes!

1371
01:31:50,546 --> 01:31:52,479
This is so much better with armor.

1372
01:31:55,054 --> 01:31:56,054
Come on!

1373
01:31:56,151 --> 01:31:57,203
Pick it up!

1374
01:31:58,934 --> 01:32:00,388
Billy, heads up!

1375
01:32:10,242 --> 01:32:12,476
Guys. They just keep coming,

1376
01:32:12,782 --> 01:32:15,110
- There's too many of them.
- You guys hold them off.

1377
01:32:15,376 --> 01:32:16,799
Where are you going, Zack?

1378
01:32:20,511 --> 01:32:24,059
Make my monster grow.

1379
01:32:30,606 --> 01:32:33,158
I've missed you, my friend.

1380
01:32:37,588 --> 01:32:40,604
We're gonna push
themselves off the edge!

1381
01:32:48,945 --> 01:32:50,796
Let's kill everyone.

1382
01:32:54,074 --> 01:32:55,270
Yo, did you guys see that?

1383
01:32:56,696 --> 01:32:58,630
Alright,
who wants me to pimp there ride too?

1384
01:32:58,631 --> 01:32:59,911
At least you didn't crash, yeah?

1385
01:33:02,650 --> 01:33:03,839
Ah, guys?

1386
01:33:04,808 --> 01:33:05,911
We are too late.

1387
01:33:09,193 --> 01:33:10,280
Oh man!

1388
01:33:11,367 --> 01:33:12,461
That...

1389
01:33:13,013 --> 01:33:14,081
It's a lot of gold.

1390
01:33:14,680 --> 01:33:16,694
We're gonna protect the crystal,
right?

1391
01:33:18,214 --> 01:33:19,529
We're going to Angel Grove.

1392
01:33:19,693 --> 01:33:20,999
Let's get the zords.

1393
01:33:22,076 --> 01:33:24,155
This is a lot
different than the van.

1394
01:33:32,023 --> 01:33:33,661
Yippie-kay-yay, Motherfuck...

1395
01:33:34,222 --> 01:33:36,097
Mother is good, Mother's is good.

1396
01:33:36,218 --> 01:33:37,631
Go, go, Power Rangers!

1397
01:33:45,976 --> 01:33:49,097
I'm not going the right way. What?
Jason, I'm going backwards.

1398
01:33:53,325 --> 01:33:54,357
Guys!

1399
01:33:55,051 --> 01:33:56,051
Our town.

1400
01:33:56,648 --> 01:33:57,915
She's destroying it.

1401
01:34:05,091 --> 01:34:06,431
Not there.

1402
01:34:07,612 --> 01:34:10,190
Rita and her golden boy
haven't found Krispy Kreme yet.

1403
01:34:10,521 --> 01:34:11,981
Okay, Kim, you hold them there.

1404
01:34:12,211 --> 01:34:14,872
Zack, Billy, you circle the Krispy
Kreme and make sure it's safe.

1405
01:34:15,011 --> 01:34:17,490
- I am heading straight for Goldar.
- Oh, hold her up!

1406
01:34:18,312 --> 01:34:19,953
Kim, I'll go with you.

1407
01:34:20,391 --> 01:34:21,196
Let's go boys.

1408
01:34:21,371 --> 01:34:23,866
- Billy, just the two of us.
- I'm right behind you

1409
01:34:26,051 --> 01:34:27,051
oops!

1410
01:34:29,931 --> 01:34:30,985
Surprise.

1411
01:34:42,750 --> 01:34:44,064
How cute.

1412
01:34:44,489 --> 01:34:48,359
The Rangers found their costumes
and their dino cars.

1413
01:34:48,565 --> 01:34:51,208
Let's give them something
else to play with.

1414
01:35:02,239 --> 01:35:03,565
Crush them!

1415
01:35:07,919 --> 01:35:09,410
How many of this you need?

1416

I'm looking for you. I'm downtown,
I'm at Mariner Bay and Reefside.

1436
01:36:49,364 --> 01:36:51,872

1437
01:36:53,685 --> 01:36:55,035

Dig, Goldar.

1447
01:38:13,570 --> 01:38:16,141
Me and Zack, we're gonna trying
to push Goldar to the water.

1448
01:38:27,220 --> 01:38:28,220
We are okay

1449
01:38:28,837 --> 01:38:31,013

I don't know what to press, ok?

1455
01:38:58,220 --> 01:38:59,579
Open wide, Rita.
