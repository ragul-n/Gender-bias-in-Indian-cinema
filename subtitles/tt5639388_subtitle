00:01:34,375 --> 00:01:38,000
<i>The Secret, Reboot</i>

2
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,458
<i>Secrets are the enemy of love.</i>

3
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:47,416
<i>I paid a huge price
to understand this.</i>

4
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,791
<i>Romania.</i>

5
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:53,000
<i>We've been here before.</i>

6
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:54,833
<i>Shaina and I.</i>

7
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:56,583
<i>This is where we met.</i>

8
00:01:56,708 --> 00:01:57,875
<i>Fell in love.</i>

9
00:01:58,291 --> 00:01:59,875
<i>Got married and</i>

10
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:02,833
<i>this is where
those secrets were born.</i>

11
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:07,791
<i>The secrets we try to bury
in order to save our love</i>

12
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:09,958
<i>don't actually stay buried.</i>

13
00:02:10,708 --> 00:02:13,458
<i>They lie in wait
for a moment</i>

14
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:18,500
<i>when they can ruin
our life and our love.</i>

15
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:24,541
<i>And I didn't know
that moment was so close to us.</i>

16
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:33,000
Mr. and Mrs. Khanna, I presume!

17
00:02:33,916 --> 00:02:35,333
Welcome to Sibiu.

18
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:37,333
My name is Mihai.

19
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:39,875
Your public relations officer.

20
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:41,833
Appointed by the bank.

21
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:44,125
Nice to finally meet you, Mihai.
Though we've met on e-mail.

22
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,166
Yes, we have.

23
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:47,041
And that's my wife Shaina.
- Nice to meet you.

24
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:48,375
Same here.
- Please follow me.

25
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:50,625
Would you believe me if I say

26
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,500
that this apartment is
100 years old?

27
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:56,125
Wow! And we're in
Dracula's country.

28
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:58,791
Yes, we're in Transylvania.

29
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:01,083
Dracula's Castle
is quite far from here.

30
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:03,666
Oh yes, of course.
It's not our first time here.

31
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:06,708
There you are. As you wanted it.

32
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:09,833
Spacious, with Romanian charm.

33
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:13,875
It's wonderful!

34
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,208
What do you think, Rehaan?
- I like it if you like it.

35
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:20,291
I love it.

36
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:27,458
Thank you for sourcing
this house, Mihai. - Welcome.

37
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,875
It's the first time
Eastern European Finance..

38
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:21,500
Shai!
- Yeah.

39
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:25,208
The pizza's warm.
Come quickly, please.

40
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,500
I'll be there in two minutes.

41
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:31,375
<i>Benefits</i>

42
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,166
I was wondering

43
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,500
you have a five year contract.

44
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:01,958
So then we'll be here
for minimum 5 years.

45
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:04,083
Yeah.

46
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:08,458
Don't make this difficult
for me.

47
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:11,125
You know what
I am trying to say.

48
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:17,625
Winters are quite cold here.

49
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:22,166
So then we should have
the baby in summer, right?

50
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:29,458
What happened?
You don't like the idea.

51
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:33,916
We just got here.

52
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,500
Do we have to discuss
everything today?

53
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:40,541
Let's settle down first
then we can talk about all this.

54
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:48,541
"Talk about all this?"

55
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:49,916
Talk about what?

56
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:51,875
We already discussed
everything in Mumbai.

57
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,791
But that was before
I was offered a job in Romania.

58
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:55,791
Everything has changed now.
- What has changed?

59
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:57,750
Shaina, it's easy to have
a child in Mumbai.

60
00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:58,958
Out here,
I'll be in the office all day

61
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:00,333
and you will be all alone.

62
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:02,166
You'll have to look after
the house, the kid by yourself.

63
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:03,458
Why alone?

64
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:05,416
Mom can come down here
for few days from Kolkata.

65
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:06,875
And it's not like
you can't find nannies here.

66
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,750
Okay, Shai,
can we please not argue now?

67
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:09,750
Tomorrow is my first day
in office.

68
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:11,500
I need to sleep
and be fresh for work.

69
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:13,125
I don't believe this!

70
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,791
Back in Mumbai,
you wanted to start a family.

71
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,208
And since we got here

72
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:17,791
you make it sound like
it was never your idea.

73
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:19,833
What's the matter with you?
- Nothing at all.

74
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:22,541
You're angry because
I forced you to take this job.

75
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:24,291
To come to Romania.
- I am not angry with you.

76
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:26,083
And can we please stop
discussing this now?

77
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:28,625
Your job in Mumbai
was beneath you!

78
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,666
You were a zonal manager
of an okay-type bank.

79
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:32,708
And here you're the head..
- So we are in Romania now!

80
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:33,958
I listened to you, didn't I?

81
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:35,458
Became the Head of
Eastern European Finance!

82
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:36,625
Anything else?

83
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:50,833
I am not a fool, Rehaan.

84
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:04,666
Ever since
we decided to come here

85
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,583
you have been very upset.

86
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:10,500
It's like you want to
say something, but you can't.

87
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:16,750
What are you hiding
from me, Rehaan?

88
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:19,291
Talk to me.

89
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:21,625
What is it?

90
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:24,500
Tell me.

91
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:25,958
You know, Shai.

92
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:28,250
I am going to sleep
in the other room.

93
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:32,000
I have no interest in arguing
with you. - Rehaan!

94
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:34,666
Rehaan.

95
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:36,958
Rehaan, what's going on?

96
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:39,333
Sleeping in separate rooms
won't solve the problem.

97
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:40,916
Rehaan, we have to talk..

98
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,916
Rehaan! Open the door.

99
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,041
Rehaan, I know you're hiding
something from me.

100
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:53,916
Something you can neither say
or nor can you endure it.

101
00:07:58,166 --> 00:07:59,833
I love you, Rehaan!

102
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:04,833
Rehaan, please open the door
and tell me.

103
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,875
Please don't keep secrets
from me.

104
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:13,833
These secrets will
drive us apart, Rehaan.

105
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:25,083
Please open the door
and tell me.

106
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:28,291
Please, Rehaan.

107
00:08:54,541 --> 00:09:03,166
"Your mysterious eyes
are conveying everything."

108
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:10,791
"The heart's listening
to your silence."

109
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:16,416
"Don't say a word, just listen."

110
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:20,666
"Stay close to me."

111
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:27,833
"Such are the mystical
depths of love."

112
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:38,416
"The soul can never
stay apart from the body."

113
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:46,166
"No matter how strong
the winds blow."

114
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:55,166
"Your mysterious eyes
are conveying everything."

115
00:09:55,750 --> 00:10:02,958
"The heart's listening
to your silence."

116
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:35,791
"You're my reason
to stay alive."

117
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:39,500
"You're the light."

118
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:48,208
"Every shining star says
you're my moonlight."

119
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:56,375
"We can never part ways."

120
00:10:56,791 --> 00:11:04,958
"You're my sunlight
and my shadow."

121
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:12,583
Rehaan! Rehaan! - "When you are
close, loneliness stays away."

122
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:22,625
Pleased to meet you.
- Pleased to meet you.

123
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,500
You want to meet..

124
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:58,041
"I'll be your refuge
in times of sorrow."

125
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:06,750
"In this world and in the next
you'll be mine."

126
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,791
"Your fragrance can be felt
all around me too."

127
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:23,708
"When the night falls
I'll be your dawn."

128
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:31,083
"If death comes for you
I'll be your knight."

129
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:41,041
"The soul can never
stay apart from the body."

130
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:49,125
"No matter how strong
the winds blow."

131
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:54,583
"Don't say a word, just listen."

132
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:58,666
"Stay close to me."

133
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:06,583
"Such are the mystical
depths of love."

134
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:42,000
Oh shit!

135
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:00,500
Hello.
- Rehaan!

136
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:02,333
Rehaan, help me please!

137
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:03,791
Shaina, what happened?
Where are you?

138
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:06,083
I don't know, Rehaan,
how I got here or when.

139
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:07,125
I have no idea.

140
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,291
Please help me, Rehaan.
Help me, please.

141
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:12,041
Okay, okay. Stop panicking.
Relax. Relax! Look around you.

142
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:14,375
Do you see a bus stop
or a sign, some name?

143
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,208
Or maybe a board.
And where are you calling from?

144
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:17,500
I am in a phone booth.

145
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:20,791
There's a sign here.
It says 'Bran 23 kilometers'.

146
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:22,791
Okay, relax and just hold on.
- Rehaan, please hurry.

147
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,416
And don't leave the damn phone
booth, I am coming. - Rehaan!

148
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:25,625
Okay? Stay there.

149
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:48,000
Listen, listen.
We need to stop here.

150
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:49,666
Stop! Stop! Stop!

151
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:01,083
Shaina!

152
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:02,875
Open the door.
- No.

153
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,916
Just open the door.
- I am scared. No.

154
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:07,958
Shaina! - No, please,
don't open the door.

155
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:09,250
What's wrong with you,
Goddamn it? - Please!

156
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:11,291
Open the door!
It's me, Shaina! Come on.

157
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:12,458
No, no!

158
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:15,541
Shaina, what's wrong with you?

159
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:16,500
Oh, my God!

160
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:18,083
Calm down! Calm down, okay.
Calm down!

161
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:19,458
Just.. come on, let's go.

162
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:22,458
Oh, my God. Your hands
are bleeding. They are bleeding.

163
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:23,666
Shaina, what did you do?

164
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:26,125
There is so much smoke.
- There's no smoke, Shaina.

165
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,791
No, I saw fire. And there was
so much fire, Rehaan. - Shaina.

166
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:30,750
There is no fire, Shaina.
- Rehaan, there's so much fire.

167
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:33,333
There is no one outside!
Let's go home! Come on!

168
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:50,125
Surely you didn't fly
to that phone booth

169
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,000
30 kilometers away from home.

170
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:54,708
Obviously you went there by car.
So where is your car?

171
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:56,458
And where is your phone?

172
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:01,291
How is it possible that
you don't remember anything?

173
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:03,416
I don't know.

174
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:10,083
I am not lying, Rehaan.
You have to believe me.

175
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:12,750
Fine.

176
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:21,625
At least, you remember why
you stepped out of the house?

177
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:26,708
Rehaan, there's this
gypsy woman. I thought..

178
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,416
Gypsy woman for what?

179
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:31,458
What the hell, Shaina?
- She can get rid of spirits..

180
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:33,375
There are no spirits
in this house!

181
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,958
Why the fuck can't
you understand that?

182
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:36,958
Stop yelling at me, Rehaan.

183
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:42,458
Please.

184
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:49,916
Fine.

185
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,750
Did you go there alone
or did you go with someone?

186
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:04,500
My 'mangalsutra'?

187
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:06,458
Where the hell
is my 'mangalsutra'?

188
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:24,041
It was right here!

189
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:29,583
Why is this happening?

190
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:42,291
Oh, my God!
Why is this happening to me?

191
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:44,750
How can it break?

192
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:52,458
It's over, Rehaan. It's over.

193
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:55,041
Relax.
- How can this happen, Rehaan?

194
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:56,500
Shai, I'll get it
fixed tomorrow.

195
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:59,000
It will all be over!
- First thing in the morning.

196
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:00,750
Shaina, I..
- It will all be over.

197
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:02,958
Nothing will happen, relax!
- What do I do?

198
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:05,125
Shaina, nothing will happen.

199
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:08,083
I'll get it sorted, Shaina.
I'll get it fixed.

200
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:18,416
Excuse me, gentlemen.

201
00:23:18,541 --> 00:23:20,291
But I'll have to take this
if you don't mind.

202
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,250
Please, sure. Go ahead.

203
00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:28,333
Rehaan, did you get
the 'mangalsutra' fixed?

204
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:32,875
Shai,
I went to the jeweler, but..

205
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:40,541
I suddenly got a call from
the office

206
00:23:40,666 --> 00:23:42,416
and I had to rush back.

207
00:23:42,541 --> 00:23:46,083
Rehaan, you said
you'd get it fixed today.

208
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:47,666
I'll get it fixed tomorrow,
without fail.

209
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,125
I promise you.

210
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:52,875
Fine.

211
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,083
Listen, Shreya and Aman are
coming over for dinner tonight.

212
00:23:57,208 --> 00:23:58,291
So..

213
00:23:58,666 --> 00:24:00,375
I mean, if you don't want

214
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,041
I can tell them
to come at another time.

215
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:03,583
No, no, no, it's fine.

216
00:24:04,875 --> 00:24:06,583
It's been a while
since we last met them.

217
00:24:06,708 --> 00:24:08,291
And I've already ordered dinner.

218
00:24:08,416 --> 00:24:10,833
Oh, okay.
- Bye.

219
00:24:11,291 --> 00:24:12,416
Bye.

220
00:24:14,791 --> 00:24:16,333
Now I understand why you were
so keen on inviting us over.

221
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:17,875
Why?
- You wanted to impress us.

222
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,125
You wanted us to prove
you're no longer loser Rehaan

223
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,291
who used to come to
our restaurant with his lover!

224
00:24:22,416 --> 00:24:24,416
Yeah.
- You know, I am glad that

225
00:24:24,541 --> 00:24:27,166
your small brain
could understand that.

226
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:29,125
Just kidding, man.

227
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:31,750
You know, Rehaan,
a man like you can never change.

228
00:24:31,875 --> 00:24:34,000
And you should never change.
Dude, you're too good.

229
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:35,208
Really?

230
00:24:35,333 --> 00:24:37,166
You should tell that to Shaina.

231
00:24:37,291 --> 00:24:38,708
She thinks I've changed.

232
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,041
Well, for all I know
she might be right.

233
00:24:41,625 --> 00:24:44,000
And anyway, we women have
a really strong sixth sense.

234
00:24:44,125 --> 00:24:46,166
Especially when it
comes to our husband.

235
00:24:46,291 --> 00:24:47,541
Oh really.

236
00:24:48,125 --> 00:24:50,666
Then you must know
about all his affairs.

237
00:24:50,791 --> 00:24:51,708
Oh shut up, bro.

238
00:24:51,833 --> 00:24:52,833
Nonsense.
- Didn't he tell you?

239
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:54,791
No, Shreya.
I am very loyal, always.

240
00:24:55,041 --> 00:24:55,958
You think so?
- Yeah.

241
00:24:56,083 --> 00:24:58,000
Okay, guys. I am going
to get another bottle of wine

242
00:24:58,125 --> 00:24:59,583
to keep this fight going.
- Yes!

243
00:24:59,708 --> 00:25:01,541
So tell me
how is your restaurant doing?

244
00:25:40,916 --> 00:25:42,333
There's no wine here.

245
00:25:44,583 --> 00:25:46,583
I'm going down
to the cellar to get some.

246
00:25:46,708 --> 00:25:48,875
It's totally fine, Shaina.
Just come.

247
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,333
Mad or what?
We're meeting after so long.

248
00:25:50,458 --> 00:25:51,375
Dude..
- We'll drink all night.

249
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,875
Shai, please get it.
- Sure!

250
00:26:50,458 --> 00:26:53,416
<i>It was merely a chain
made of black beads for me.</i>

251
00:26:53,875 --> 00:26:56,041
<i>But the evil force
knew the importance</i>

252
00:26:56,333 --> 00:26:59,000
<i>of the 'mangalsutra'
more than I did.</i>

253
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:01,041
<i>As long as the
'mangalsutra' existed</i>

254
00:27:01,166 --> 00:27:02,625
<i>he could've never made</i>

255
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,625
<i>a place for itself
between Shaina and me.</i>

256
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,166
<i>But he got rid of the
'mangalsutra' from its way.</i>

257
00:27:09,541 --> 00:27:11,500
<i>And took control over Shaina.</i>

258
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:14,208
<i>Technically
Shaina was close to me.</i>

259
00:27:14,583 --> 00:27:16,458
<i>But she was a prisoner
in her own body</i>

260
00:27:16,583 --> 00:27:18,250
<i>she started drifting apart
from me.</i>

261
00:27:18,875 --> 00:27:22,125
<i>The moment which my secrets
were lying in wait of</i>

262
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:24,125
<i>had arrived.</i>

263
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:25,916
<i>And I?</i>

264
00:27:26,041 --> 00:27:29,666
<i>I didn't know that
my fight for my love</i>

265
00:27:29,791 --> 00:27:30,958
<i>my Shaina</i>

266
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:32,458
<i>was only just beginning.</i>

267
00:27:32,583 --> 00:27:35,125
Anton,
did I get a chain with me?

268
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:36,541
A chain, sir?

269
00:27:36,666 --> 00:27:37,750
It's a..

270
00:27:38,083 --> 00:27:40,208
It's got these diamonds
along with black beads.

271
00:27:40,875 --> 00:27:43,500
Not that I can remember,
but I can look for it.

272
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,041
No, that's okay.

273
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:49,125
Hello.

274
00:27:51,291 --> 00:27:53,916
Sir, the police are
on the phone for you.

275
00:28:23,458 --> 00:28:24,583
Officer.

276
00:28:25,916 --> 00:28:26,875
Hello.

277
00:28:27,541 --> 00:28:29,833
Mr. Khanna, I presume.
- Yeah, that's right.

278
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,125
Please.

279
00:28:32,125 --> 00:28:35,000
Can you identify if this
is your missing car, sir?

280
00:28:36,416 --> 00:28:39,333
Yeah, this is the one.
- All right.

281
00:28:39,958 --> 00:28:42,250
We shall have the vehicle
towed to the station.

282
00:28:42,583 --> 00:28:44,666
And if you can come around,
complete the paper work.

283
00:28:44,791 --> 00:28:46,666
And then you will have
your car back.

284
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:48,083
Sure, thank you.

285
00:29:05,333 --> 00:29:06,708
Shaina.

286
00:29:29,416 --> 00:29:32,541
Shaina, have you lost your mind?
What are you doing?

287
00:29:32,666 --> 00:29:36,458
I am feeling so hot!

288
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:42,000
So fucking hot!

289
00:29:42,291 --> 00:29:43,750
It's minus 10 degrees outside.

290
00:29:43,875 --> 00:29:45,500
If you catch a cold
you can fall sick.

291
00:29:45,625 --> 00:29:47,541
You found the car, didn't you?

292
00:29:50,041 --> 00:29:51,875
When you had the 'mangalsutra'

293
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,708
you couldn't find the car.

294
00:29:55,958 --> 00:30:00,375
Now you found the car,
and lost the 'mangalsutra'.

295
00:30:02,875 --> 00:30:05,500
You can never take care
of anything.

296
00:30:06,625 --> 00:30:10,208
Neither relationships
nor its memorabilia.

297
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,625
Hey..
- Come in, guys.

298
00:32:01,291 --> 00:32:04,333
Shaina's been behaving very
strange for the past few days.

299
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:05,875
And today..

300
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,083
Strange?

301
00:32:07,833 --> 00:32:10,166
But you both are
behaving strange, Rehaan.

302
00:32:10,291 --> 00:32:11,875
Especially with each other.

303
00:32:12,541 --> 00:32:14,750
Okay, it doesn't take
a detective to figure out

304
00:32:14,875 --> 00:32:17,041
that things aren't
right between you two.

305
00:32:18,416 --> 00:32:20,208
I've noticed that Shaina's
other side of the bed

306
00:32:20,333 --> 00:32:22,000
has not been slept in.

307
00:32:22,125 --> 00:32:25,375
And I've seen you coming
out of the other bedroom, so..

308
00:32:25,916 --> 00:32:28,125
Why is it that you need separate
bedrooms in the first place?

309
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:29,833
Shreya, for God's sake.

310
00:32:29,958 --> 00:32:31,791
This is their personal matter.
Right, so.. - Please.

311
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:33,458
If it's their personal matter

312
00:32:33,583 --> 00:32:36,625
then what are we doing here
5 AM in the morning?

313
00:32:38,541 --> 00:32:40,791
And Rehaan,
if you want to cure Shaina

314
00:32:40,916 --> 00:32:43,416
you must first mend
your relationship with her!

315
00:32:43,541 --> 00:32:44,333
Shreya, please.

316
00:32:44,458 --> 00:32:45,916
What's wrong with you?
- Aman..

317
00:32:46,208 --> 00:32:47,291
She's right.

318
00:32:49,375 --> 00:32:52,500
But honestly, I don't know
where to begin from.

319
00:32:53,291 --> 00:32:54,375
Try the beginning.

320
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:58,291
Back in India
I was the zonal manager of

321
00:32:58,416 --> 00:32:59,791
South Asian Bank.

322
00:33:00,791 --> 00:33:02,458
But the pay wasn't like
in Europe.

323
00:33:02,916 --> 00:33:05,208
It took us three years
to buy a house in Mumbai.

324
00:33:05,333 --> 00:33:07,750
And soon after that I was
offered this job in Romania.

325
00:33:08,208 --> 00:33:11,708
But I didn't want to sell
my house

326
00:33:12,291 --> 00:33:14,416
and start all over again.

327
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:16,625
Shaina wanted to come here.

328
00:33:17,583 --> 00:33:19,250
That's where
the problem started from.

329
00:33:19,375 --> 00:33:21,250
Every day fights,
every day arguments.

330
00:33:23,416 --> 00:33:25,541
After coming here,
Shaina wanted to start a family.

331
00:33:25,833 --> 00:33:27,083
But I didn't want to.

332
00:33:27,583 --> 00:33:28,791
Which led to more fights,
more arguments.

333
00:33:28,916 --> 00:33:30,250
But what possibly happened,
Rehaan

334
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:31,875
that you didn't want kids?

335
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,041
So scared of being intimate that

336
00:33:34,166 --> 00:33:37,416
you have to sleep
in a separate bedroom?

337
00:33:38,333 --> 00:33:39,458
It..

338
00:33:40,875 --> 00:33:43,708
Rehaan. Do you still love her?

339
00:33:43,833 --> 00:33:46,291
Of course, dude. More than ever.

340
00:33:46,416 --> 00:33:50,208
Then you should know that Shania
was really, really scared.

341
00:33:51,583 --> 00:33:54,541
In fact, she mentioned
something to me as well.

342
00:33:55,458 --> 00:33:59,541
Something about this house
like there's someone here.

343
00:34:00,291 --> 00:34:03,333
A ghost.. I don't know, but..

344
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:06,500
She was honestly
very scared, Rehaan.

345
00:34:07,791 --> 00:34:10,083
Rehaan,
she could be depressed as well.

346
00:34:10,583 --> 00:34:12,875
I mean, all this could be
a delusion as well.

347
00:34:13,291 --> 00:34:16,500
Perhaps we should take her
to a psychiatrist.

348
00:34:17,208 --> 00:34:20,583
No, Aman. Those who see ghosts
are not crazy.

349
00:34:22,416 --> 00:34:24,791
It's those who don't see
human beings.

350
00:34:27,583 --> 00:34:29,250
She kept reaching out to me.

351
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:32,791
She kept asking for my help.

352
00:34:37,583 --> 00:34:39,375
But I kept avoiding her.

353
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,791
I had left her alone.

354
00:34:49,083 --> 00:34:50,916
I had distanced her from myself.

355
00:34:56,666 --> 00:35:02,416
But now I must hear what
Shaina's been trying to say.

356
00:35:08,208 --> 00:35:09,166
Hmm.

357
00:35:09,916 --> 00:35:10,958
You're right.

358
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:14,916
And Rehaan, I know who
can help us in this situation.

359
00:35:15,208 --> 00:35:17,375
Trilok Shastri.
- Rehaan.

360
00:35:17,708 --> 00:35:19,750
Nice to meet you, Rehaan.
- Likewise.

361
00:35:19,875 --> 00:35:23,166
So, is this guy priest
or some kind of exorcist? - No.

362
00:35:23,291 --> 00:35:25,125
He's come here
to do religious studies.

363
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,958
He's blind, but he has
the gift of psychometry.

364
00:35:28,083 --> 00:35:29,875
Cup?
- Yes, I have it.

365
00:35:33,208 --> 00:35:34,250
Here.

366
00:35:37,958 --> 00:35:39,750
What is psychometry?
- It's a gift.

367
00:35:39,875 --> 00:35:41,583
Something like ESP.

368
00:35:41,875 --> 00:35:43,708
For example,
take your cellphone.

369
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:47,541
He can tell a lot about you,
by just touching it.

370
00:35:47,666 --> 00:35:50,750
Like your problems,
your past, your present.

371
00:35:51,541 --> 00:35:55,791
I can feel it. Two mouths.

372
00:36:03,875 --> 00:36:06,083
What's the matter?
- It's evil.

373
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:08,458
Very evil!

374
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:12,333
The spirit controlling
Shaina's body.. - What?

375
00:36:12,625 --> 00:36:14,541
It's a terrible spirit.

376
00:36:15,125 --> 00:36:17,791
Mr. Rehaan,
your wife is possessed.

377
00:36:41,333 --> 00:36:43,291
Is she home?
- No.

378
00:36:44,541 --> 00:36:45,625
Good.

379
00:36:46,708 --> 00:36:48,333
How long do we have?

380
00:36:48,458 --> 00:36:49,791
Aman and Shreya
have taken her out.

381
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:51,791
They will keep her busy
for at least two hours.

382
00:36:51,916 --> 00:36:54,833
Hey, Shaina.
Why don't you try this?

383
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,833
To help Shaina get better

384
00:37:05,625 --> 00:37:07,750
we need to know
who this spirit is.

385
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,375
And why is it controlling her?

386
00:37:11,333 --> 00:37:13,541
And for that I need one
of your wife's belonging

387
00:37:13,666 --> 00:37:15,541
which she uses every day!

388
00:37:23,833 --> 00:37:24,916
Here you are.

389
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:34,708
This brush has Shaina's energy.

390
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,791
With psychometry
I will try to see everything

391
00:37:38,916 --> 00:37:40,916
that Shaina saw or heard.

392
00:37:41,875 --> 00:37:44,083
I'll write down
whatever I see for us.

393
00:37:45,125 --> 00:37:46,875
Just remember one thing.

394
00:37:48,083 --> 00:37:50,041
This is like
a kind of meditation.

395
00:37:51,458 --> 00:37:55,583
The only difference is
if I am interrupted

396
00:37:56,291 --> 00:37:58,625
I won't be able to connect
to her energies again.

397
00:37:59,541 --> 00:38:01,083
I'll make sure
you're not interrupted.

398
00:38:01,208 --> 00:38:02,333
Thank you.

399
00:38:35,583 --> 00:38:36,666
Shaina!

400
00:38:51,375 --> 00:38:52,291
Hello.

401
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:54,000
Hello, Rehaan.
- Yeah, Shreya.

402
00:38:54,125 --> 00:38:56,291
She knows.
We just couldn't control her.

403
00:38:56,416 --> 00:38:58,708
She ran away
and she's coming home.

404
00:38:58,833 --> 00:38:59,708
Oh my God!

405
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,375
Shaina!

406
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,208
Oh my God!

407
00:41:06,291 --> 00:41:09,875
Unfortunately
I could not finish.

408
00:41:11,125 --> 00:41:14,125
But I wrote everything
I could find out in this.

409
00:41:24,291 --> 00:41:27,083
<i>It's been only three days since
Rehaan and I came to Romania.</i>

410
00:41:27,416 --> 00:41:29,500
<i>And in these three days
it feels like</i>

411
00:41:29,625 --> 00:41:33,125
<i>our entire lives have changed,
and not just the country.</i>

412
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:35,958
<i>Rehaan stays away from me.</i>

413
00:41:36,375 --> 00:41:38,041
<i>He doesn't even look me
in the eye.</i>

414
00:41:38,708 --> 00:41:41,000
<i>I told him about
the wash-basin incident</i>

415
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:43,458
<i>but he brushed it off
as a joke.</i>

416
00:41:44,166 --> 00:41:47,750
<i>It's like I am living in a maze.
In a puzzle.</i>

417
00:41:48,875 --> 00:41:52,750
<i>I am lonely. Very lonely.</i>

418
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:38,083
Shaina..

419
00:45:17,666 --> 00:45:20,458
<i>I wanted to wake Rehaan up
and tell him everything.</i>

420
00:45:21,125 --> 00:45:22,625
<i>But then I realized</i>

421
00:45:23,333 --> 00:45:26,375
<i>he'll treat this as a joke
and ignore it.</i>

422
00:45:27,041 --> 00:45:29,541
<i>To make Rehaan believe that
there's something in this house</i>

423
00:45:30,333 --> 00:45:32,041
<i>I needed evidence.</i>

424
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,833
<i>I would have to prove to Rehaan
that something was wrong.</i>

425
00:45:37,666 --> 00:45:40,125
I need something that can record
once the lights are turned off

426
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:43,125
and then maybe I could watch it
on my laptop afterwards.

427
00:45:43,583 --> 00:45:46,416
Oh, then you need a night-vision
camera with a memory card.

428
00:45:46,541 --> 00:45:48,708
Let me show you.
- All right, thank you.

429
00:45:50,333 --> 00:45:51,375
It's pointless.

430
00:45:59,125 --> 00:46:02,083
You can't capture it on camera.

431
00:46:04,791 --> 00:46:06,000
What the hell!

432
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:10,000
Aditya,
please don't start this again.

433
00:46:10,458 --> 00:46:13,166
Following me around,
bothering me.. Just please stop.

434
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:16,750
Aditya, the court
doesn't allow you

435
00:46:16,875 --> 00:46:18,791
to come closer
than 100 meters to me.

436
00:46:19,375 --> 00:46:21,208
Don't forget
I can get you arrested.

437
00:46:21,333 --> 00:46:22,250
Just stay away.

438
00:46:22,375 --> 00:46:23,750
You can send me to jail

439
00:46:23,875 --> 00:46:25,875
but how will you
liberate yourself, Shaina?

440
00:46:27,541 --> 00:46:29,333
Whether Rehaan
believes you or not

441
00:46:29,458 --> 00:46:31,250
I know what's happening
with you.

442
00:46:32,666 --> 00:46:35,458
Shaina, I know
your house is haunted.

443
00:46:36,375 --> 00:46:37,958
I know your life is in danger.

444
00:46:38,625 --> 00:46:40,958
Just let me talk to you
for 10 minutes.

445
00:46:41,083 --> 00:46:43,083
And if you don't understand
what I am saying

446
00:46:43,208 --> 00:46:45,166
then I promise,
you will never see me again.

447
00:46:46,125 --> 00:46:48,750
Only 10 minutes. Please.

448
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:59,083
Your 10 minutes start now.

449
00:47:01,208 --> 00:47:04,291
Shaina, I know things
ended very badly between us.

450
00:47:05,041 --> 00:47:06,833
I know I behaved
very badly with you.

451
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:09,416
You showered me with love, and

452
00:47:09,541 --> 00:47:11,583
I kept making mistakes,
continuously.

453
00:47:12,166 --> 00:47:13,416
But things have changed now.

454
00:47:14,041 --> 00:47:15,458
I've changed, trust me.

455
00:47:15,583 --> 00:47:16,875
I am a different person.

456
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,625
Are we here to talk about
the past or the present, Aditya?

457
00:47:21,041 --> 00:47:24,458
I didn't know that
you're back in Romania.

458
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:26,458
But..

459
00:47:29,666 --> 00:47:33,291
I started having these dreams,
these very vivid dreams.

460
00:47:34,333 --> 00:47:36,083
You and Rehaan coming back here.

461
00:47:37,333 --> 00:47:39,541
And then you felt someone's
presence in that house.

462
00:47:39,666 --> 00:47:42,083
Your problems,
your fear, your quarrels.

463
00:47:43,041 --> 00:47:44,166
Even..

464
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:47,125
Even that you and Rehaan are
sleeping in separate bedrooms.

465
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:50,125
Tell me, Shaina, is it all true?

466
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,125
Is it true?

467
00:47:55,958 --> 00:47:56,875
Go on.

468
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,500
I don't know
why I am getting these dreams.

469
00:48:00,375 --> 00:48:01,875
I didn't want to meet you.

470
00:48:02,708 --> 00:48:05,958
But then I thought
your life could be in danger.

471
00:48:06,375 --> 00:48:08,750
I am afraid for you.
I am very afraid for you.

472
00:48:09,541 --> 00:48:14,416
Tell me, do you feel there's
someone else is in that house?

473
00:48:15,708 --> 00:48:17,666
Do you not see the
blood flow from that laptop?

474
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:19,500
Or..

475
00:48:19,625 --> 00:48:21,541
Or that eye
in the bathroom sink?

476
00:48:24,375 --> 00:48:25,625
How do you know?

477
00:48:26,875 --> 00:48:28,291
How do you know all this?

478
00:48:29,291 --> 00:48:30,916
Everything that's happening
with me

479
00:48:32,125 --> 00:48:34,333
how can you see it
in your dreams?

480
00:48:34,458 --> 00:48:38,583
If it's all true, then
I believe there's some power

481
00:48:38,708 --> 00:48:41,000
that wants to save you
through me.

482
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:43,791
Shaina, I know
you don't trust me.

483
00:48:44,333 --> 00:48:45,583
But you have to believe me.

484
00:48:47,583 --> 00:48:49,083
Shaina, please believe me.

485
00:48:50,125 --> 00:48:52,625
Who were you talking to?
Tell me, you scheming witch.

486
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:54,166
Shaina, please believe me.

487
00:48:56,958 --> 00:48:58,375
I want to save you.

488
00:48:58,500 --> 00:48:59,833
Shaina, listen to me.

489
00:49:02,166 --> 00:49:03,291
I.. I don't need..

490
00:49:03,416 --> 00:49:06,250
I don't need your help.
- Shaina, try to understand.

491
00:49:06,708 --> 00:49:08,041
You're all alone.

492
00:49:08,791 --> 00:49:10,291
Even Rehaan doesn't believe you.

493
00:49:10,416 --> 00:49:13,625
Rehaan loves me, sooner or later
I will make him believe me.

494
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:15,583
So thanks, but no thanks.

495
00:49:15,708 --> 00:49:17,000
Shaina, listen to me.

496
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:18,625
Shaina.

497
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:23,000
I even know what's going
to happen with you tonight.

498
00:49:23,416 --> 00:49:25,875
Would you like to know?
- I don't want to know!

499
00:50:13,625 --> 00:50:14,458
Rehaan.

500
00:50:14,583 --> 00:50:15,708
Rehaan, come with me.
- What happened?

501
00:50:15,833 --> 00:50:16,833
Just come.

502
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:21,000
Rehaan, that spirit.
I caught it on tape.

503
00:50:21,125 --> 00:50:23,291
Just give me one second.
- You cannot be serious, Shaina.

504
00:50:23,416 --> 00:50:26,208
Rehaan, please..
just.. just one second, please.

505
00:50:28,791 --> 00:50:30,625
Look.. Just a second.

506
00:50:33,083 --> 00:50:36,041
What?
- One second. One second.

507
00:50:36,166 --> 00:50:38,583
2:55.. Here 3 AM.

508
00:50:38,708 --> 00:50:41,000
The footage after 3 AM.

509
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,666
What?
- It was there.

510
00:50:47,791 --> 00:50:49,416
Just..
Just give me another second.

511
00:50:49,541 --> 00:50:50,458
Just one second.

512
00:50:50,583 --> 00:50:52,541
Shaina, I don't have time
for this. - No, no, one second.

513
00:50:52,666 --> 00:50:54,875
Listen
Rehaan! Rehaan! Rehaan!

514
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,625
Please, Rehaan.
You have to believe me.

515
00:50:56,750 --> 00:50:58,333
I am telling you
there's something in this house.

516
00:50:58,458 --> 00:50:59,583
There's a spirit!

517
00:50:59,708 --> 00:51:01,166
Please, I told you before.

518
00:51:01,291 --> 00:51:04,125
It's just.. Please listen.
- I know.

519
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:06,041
You saw an eye
in the wash-basin.

520
00:51:06,166 --> 00:51:07,791
You saw someone come
out of the bed, right?

521
00:51:07,916 --> 00:51:09,166
Yes, Right, Rehaan.

522
00:51:09,291 --> 00:51:11,375
Rehaan, why can't
we leave this house?

523
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:12,541
Rehaan, please try
and understand.

524
00:51:12,666 --> 00:51:15,333
Your company can give you..
- It's not a joke, Shaina!

525
00:51:15,458 --> 00:51:17,083
Back in Mumbai you asked me
to sell the house and I did.

526
00:51:17,208 --> 00:51:18,083
You said let's go to Romania,
and I did.

527
00:51:18,208 --> 00:51:19,375
Now you want me to sell
this house too.

528
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:21,291
I mean we'll have
to settle down somewhere.

529
00:51:21,416 --> 00:51:23,625
I can't start to panic
every time you panic.

530
00:51:24,458 --> 00:51:26,416
The company's already
paid six month's rent in advance

531
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:29,416
Now I can't ask them for another
house because you see ghosts.

532
00:51:31,333 --> 00:51:34,958
Rehaan, what's happened
to you since we got here?

533
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,625
Everything I say sounds
like a lie to you.

534
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:47,291
Shaina, I have
a business to run. Okay?

535
00:51:47,541 --> 00:51:48,958
So just excuse me.

536
00:51:50,791 --> 00:51:52,041
But, Rehaan..

537
00:51:54,416 --> 00:51:55,666
Rehaan.

538
00:51:57,625 --> 00:52:00,625
<i>I even know what's going
to happen with you tonight.</i>

539
00:52:02,666 --> 00:52:05,208
<i>You may capture that
spirit on camera, Shaina.</i>

540
00:52:06,166 --> 00:52:09,250
But only you will be to see it,
and no one else.

541
00:52:10,083 --> 00:52:11,041
Are you listening?

542
00:52:11,166 --> 00:52:12,541
<i>No one else.</i>

543
00:52:26,208 --> 00:52:28,125
Here in Romania
they call it the Strigoi.

544
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:31,083
It's a very powerful force,
a spirit.

545
00:52:31,708 --> 00:52:35,083
It doesn't trouble you,
but seeks revenge.

546
00:52:36,208 --> 00:52:39,208
The spirit in your home
is something similar.

547
00:52:39,958 --> 00:52:41,958
She wants revenge for something.

548
00:52:42,083 --> 00:52:43,500
So all this..

549
00:52:44,541 --> 00:52:46,666
You saw it in your dreams?
- Yes.

550
00:52:47,333 --> 00:52:49,166
What if I leave that home?

551
00:52:51,333 --> 00:52:52,416
No point.

552
00:52:54,166 --> 00:52:56,625
Walls made of bricks
can be home for you

553
00:52:56,750 --> 00:53:01,000
but he wants to
make your body his home.

554
00:53:02,708 --> 00:53:06,875
Shaina, you can't
get rid of it so easily.

555
00:53:07,208 --> 00:53:10,416
But why?
How have I harmed her?

556
00:53:11,041 --> 00:53:13,375
Why is it seeking revenge
from me?

557
00:53:14,208 --> 00:53:16,208
Shaina, she's just hurting you.

558
00:53:17,083 --> 00:53:18,166
But revenge..

559
00:53:27,125 --> 00:53:28,625
She's seeking revenge
from Rehaan.

560
00:53:30,291 --> 00:53:32,250
You mean Rehaan's done
something

561
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:35,041
because of which all this
has been..

562
00:53:36,625 --> 00:53:37,666
Yes!

563
00:53:39,583 --> 00:53:40,833
Oh God!

564
00:53:49,208 --> 00:53:54,041
Wow! How silly am I!
You haven't changed, Aditya.

565
00:53:54,458 --> 00:53:56,041
You're still playing games
with me.

566
00:53:56,166 --> 00:53:58,458
Don't be stupid, Shaina.
I am not playing any games.

567
00:53:58,833 --> 00:53:59,750
Think about it.

568
00:53:59,875 --> 00:54:01,333
All those things which
you never told anyone.

569
00:54:01,458 --> 00:54:03,125
How do I know all
those things, huh?

570
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:04,791
And if my dreams are true

571
00:54:04,916 --> 00:54:06,541
then everything
I saw must be true.

572
00:54:06,875 --> 00:54:08,333
Shaina, there is some secret

573
00:54:08,458 --> 00:54:09,750
which Rehaan is hiding from you!

574
00:54:09,875 --> 00:54:11,625
Look, I don't know
how you've done this.

575
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:13,708
You bugged my house,
you must have just..

576
00:54:13,833 --> 00:54:14,833
Don't be ridiculous!

577
00:54:14,958 --> 00:54:16,333
I don't want to break
your marriage.

578
00:54:16,458 --> 00:54:17,166
I want to help you.

579
00:54:17,291 --> 00:54:19,083
Stop lying, Aditya.
Rehaan isn't like that.

580
00:54:19,208 --> 00:54:20,083
Rehaan can never do
anything like that.

581
00:54:20,208 --> 00:54:21,916
Shaina, whatever is happening
with you, in your house

582
00:54:22,041 --> 00:54:23,291
it's all Rehaan's fault.

583
00:54:23,416 --> 00:54:24,916
Just stop, Aditya,
I don't want to know.

584
00:54:25,041 --> 00:54:26,375
Shaina, listen to me!

585
00:54:33,958 --> 00:54:36,958
I know what Rehaan is hiding
from you.

586
00:54:38,458 --> 00:54:41,916
But you got to ask yourself,
do you want to know?

587
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:46,000
Do you want to know
what that secret is?

588
00:54:57,791 --> 00:54:58,833
No!

589
00:54:59,625 --> 00:55:01,166
I don't want to know.

590
00:55:01,708 --> 00:55:03,291
Because I know the truth.

591
00:55:03,916 --> 00:55:06,791
The truth is that
because I walked away from you

592
00:55:07,416 --> 00:55:09,916
you're seeking revenge
from me.

593
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,291
Shaina, there is some secret

594
00:55:24,625 --> 00:55:26,125
which Rehaan is hiding from you!

595
00:55:42,791 --> 00:55:43,916
Hello.

596
00:55:45,125 --> 00:55:46,166
Hello.

597
00:55:53,833 --> 00:56:02,041
"I admit that
you don't love me anymore."

598
00:56:02,583 --> 00:56:10,916
"You don't remember me,
I don't remember you."

599
00:56:11,291 --> 00:56:20,000
"Just turn around
and look at me, sweetheart."

600
00:56:20,125 --> 00:56:28,625
"I admit that
you don't love me anymore."

601
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:38,250
"You don't remember me,
I don't remember you."

602
00:56:40,083 --> 00:56:42,583
Rehaan.
- Yeah.

603
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:46,416
Are you going to sleep
in the guest bedroom again?

604
00:56:50,833 --> 00:56:52,833
Actually,
I've loads of work, so..

605
00:56:54,458 --> 00:56:58,166
I mean I'll be in the next room,
not the next city.

606
00:57:02,833 --> 00:57:03,708
Yeah.

607
00:57:03,833 --> 00:57:05,625
Shreya, I am really scared.

608
00:57:06,166 --> 00:57:07,166
There's something.

609
00:57:07,291 --> 00:57:09,916
I mean
there's someone around me.

610
00:57:10,041 --> 00:57:11,875
What? What do you mean?

611
00:57:12,416 --> 00:57:16,291
I think my house is haunted.
- Are you serious?

612
00:57:17,375 --> 00:57:19,750
So no need to hesitate.

613
00:57:20,416 --> 00:57:22,250
I believe you.
- You do?

614
00:57:22,375 --> 00:57:23,833
Of course I do.

615
00:57:24,416 --> 00:57:27,791
And anyway, ghosts, spirits.

616
00:57:27,916 --> 00:57:29,625
I do believe they exist.

617
00:57:34,125 --> 00:57:42,791
"I admit I never saw
that mole on your shoulder."

618
00:57:42,916 --> 00:57:51,583
"I admit
you never shattered my heart."

619
00:57:51,708 --> 00:58:00,416
"I never spent those summers
in your refuge."

620
00:58:00,541 --> 00:58:09,083
"And I never spent those winters
in your arms."

621
00:58:09,208 --> 00:58:17,791
"I admit
you don't trust me anymore."

622
00:58:17,916 --> 00:58:26,458
"You don't remember me,
I don't remember you."

623
00:58:52,666 --> 00:59:01,291
"Go take my slumber
I won't say a word."

624
00:59:01,416 --> 00:59:09,750
"If you take my dreams,
how will I live?"

625
00:59:10,291 --> 00:59:18,875
"There's nowhere I can dwell
except for in your breath."

626
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:27,583
"The only place I want to die
is in your arms."

627
00:59:27,708 --> 00:59:36,333
"I admit you don't care
about me anymore."

628
00:59:36,458 --> 00:59:45,500
"You don't remember me,
I don't remember you."

629
00:59:53,708 --> 00:59:55,666
<i>What are you hiding from me,
Rehaan?</i>

630
00:59:57,958 --> 00:59:59,708
<i>The company's already paid
six month's rent in advance.</i>

631
00:59:59,833 --> 01:00:02,750
<i>Now I can't ask them for another
house because you see ghosts.</i>

632
01:00:29,875 --> 01:00:32,958
I am ready to hear
whatever you want to tell me.

633
01:00:34,333 --> 01:00:36,000
Tell me everything, Aditya.

634
01:00:37,916 --> 01:00:40,291
What's he done that
he's hiding from me?

635
01:00:42,166 --> 01:00:43,583
Tell me everything.

636
01:00:48,875 --> 01:00:50,291
Rehaan's murdered someone.

637
01:00:52,916 --> 01:00:54,208
What?

638
01:00:54,333 --> 01:00:57,916
He killed someone before
you went to Mumbai.

639
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:03,125
Shaina, it's that person's
spirit that wants revenge.

640
01:01:05,250 --> 01:01:10,750
Listen to me.
I'm.. I'm very sorry, Shaina.

641
01:01:11,458 --> 01:01:15,833
Oh my God.
Rehaan's a murderer.

642
01:01:18,416 --> 01:01:20,041
I can't believe this.

643
01:01:23,708 --> 01:01:25,500
I couldn't believe it either,
Shaina.

644
01:01:27,958 --> 01:01:31,291
But there is a way
we can find out

645
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:34,291
if Rehaan's done anything
like that.

646
01:01:35,375 --> 01:01:36,416
How?

647
01:01:38,041 --> 01:01:39,916
<i>I saw in my dreams that</i>

648
01:01:40,416 --> 01:01:41,291
<i>after committing the murder</i>

649
01:01:41,416 --> 01:01:44,041
<i>he hid his bloodied clothes
somewhere.</i>

650
01:01:45,208 --> 01:01:48,208
<i>There was some repair work
going on in your old house.</i>

651
01:01:49,041 --> 01:01:50,625
<i>And a false wall was being built</i>

652
01:01:50,750 --> 01:01:52,333
<i>in the south side of the house.</i>

653
01:01:53,083 --> 01:01:56,041
<i>If my dream is true, that's
where the clothes will be.</i>

654
01:01:57,958 --> 01:02:00,750
<i>A lot of people tried
to live in that house, Shaina.</i>

655
01:02:01,416 --> 01:02:03,625
<i>But no one could live
for more than two months.</i>

656
01:02:04,958 --> 01:02:06,583
<i>That house is still empty.</i>

657
01:02:07,541 --> 01:02:09,250
<i>We must go in that house.</i>

658
01:02:09,375 --> 01:02:11,125
<i>And we've to break that
damn wall.</i>

659
01:02:39,416 --> 01:02:42,125
You still put your initials
on your clothes.

660
01:02:42,583 --> 01:02:44,458
Still in boarding school
little boy.

661
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,041
Shut up.

662
01:02:54,625 --> 01:03:00,958
"Your mysterious eyes"

663
01:03:01,791 --> 01:03:08,625
"are conveying everything."

664
01:03:09,375 --> 01:03:15,125
"The heart's listening"

665
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:20,000
"to your silence."

666
01:03:21,875 --> 01:03:23,083
Shaina.

667
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:25,833
Where have you been?

668
01:03:26,291 --> 01:03:27,708
I've been calling you
for so long.

669
01:03:33,250 --> 01:03:35,833
What's wrong, Shaina? All okay?

670
01:03:38,458 --> 01:03:39,791
What's the matter, Shai?

671
01:03:40,458 --> 01:03:43,250
What happened? You okay?

672
01:03:45,625 --> 01:03:46,750
Shaina!

673
01:03:51,833 --> 01:03:52,916
Shaina!

674
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,166
Open the door.

675
01:03:55,291 --> 01:03:56,583
Open the door, Shaina.

676
01:03:57,875 --> 01:03:59,083
Shaina!

677
01:03:59,583 --> 01:04:01,291
Shaina, open the door.

678
01:04:02,791 --> 01:04:03,958
Shaina!

679
01:04:04,083 --> 01:04:05,625
Open the door, Shaina.

680
01:04:06,291 --> 01:04:07,208
Shaina!

681
01:04:07,333 --> 01:04:09,166
Just stop it, damn it.

682
01:04:09,583 --> 01:04:10,833
Shaina!

683
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,416
Shaina, open the door.

684
01:05:13,583 --> 01:05:15,208
I am sorry, I'll wait out.

685
01:05:31,875 --> 01:05:34,458
Shai, I must go
to Munich today.

686
01:05:35,125 --> 01:05:35,958
Okay.

687
01:05:36,083 --> 01:05:37,416
Head of Operations died
last night of a heart attack..

688
01:05:37,541 --> 01:05:39,125
I didn't ask you for a reason.

689
01:05:39,708 --> 01:05:41,791
And you don't have to
tell me one.

690
01:05:46,958 --> 01:05:48,458
Will you see me to the station?

691
01:05:57,791 --> 01:05:59,916
Shaina.
- Huh!

692
01:06:00,333 --> 01:06:01,666
Is everything okay?

693
01:06:02,541 --> 01:06:06,041
You tell me, Rehaan.
Is everything okay?

694
01:06:08,958 --> 01:06:11,375
Haven't you been behaving
strange for the past few days?

695
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:13,291
Are you asking me
or telling me?

696
01:06:16,166 --> 01:06:17,416
Is there something?

697
01:06:19,041 --> 01:06:20,541
Are you hiding
something from me?

698
01:06:21,208 --> 01:06:23,291
What if I ask you
the same question?

699
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:48,500
Rehaan's gone to Munich.
He'll return after 2 days.

700
01:06:52,041 --> 01:06:54,666
Then we must do whatever
needs to be done in two days.

701
01:06:55,416 --> 01:06:56,833
Within these two days..

702
01:07:00,958 --> 01:07:02,291
Shaina, I am so sorry.

703
01:07:03,916 --> 01:07:06,083
I know this must be difficult
for you.

704
01:07:07,541 --> 01:07:09,541
You can give this another
thought if you want.

705
01:07:09,666 --> 01:07:13,708
No, Aditya,
I need to know the truth.

706
01:07:14,750 --> 01:07:17,208
How can he hide such
a big secret from me?

707
01:07:18,541 --> 01:07:21,166
He made me fall in love
with the Rehaan that he's not.

708
01:07:22,666 --> 01:07:24,666
My marriage is a lie.

709
01:07:25,791 --> 01:07:28,083
And I want to know
the truth behind this lie.

710
01:07:32,375 --> 01:07:35,250
We must find out
whom Rehaan killed.

711
01:07:36,291 --> 01:07:38,958
She's a gypsy woman.
She lives close to Bran.

712
01:07:39,708 --> 01:07:40,916
Okay.

713
01:07:42,625 --> 01:07:45,416
Shaina, she's the
best psychic in the area.

714
01:07:46,250 --> 01:07:48,041
She's a very,
very gifted medium.

715
01:07:56,416 --> 01:08:02,500
You're right. There's a Strigoi
that follows you, haunts you.

716
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:09,083
What is your next question?

717
01:08:10,666 --> 01:08:12,416
Has my husband done this?

718
01:08:13,166 --> 01:08:14,750
Has he murdered someone?

719
01:08:16,083 --> 01:08:17,541
Pick the cards.

720
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:35,708
Your husband is keeping
secrets from you.

721
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,166
He has taken a life.

722
01:08:39,041 --> 01:08:40,791
I see it clearly.

723
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,666
Do you know who it is?

724
01:08:48,833 --> 01:08:50,583
Does a name come to mind?

725
01:08:50,708 --> 01:08:52,291
A relation perhaps?

726
01:09:33,541 --> 01:09:35,166
This is a terrible entity.

727
01:09:35,291 --> 01:09:37,875
It wants to attack you,
it wants to possess you.

728
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,291
I don't want to have
anything to do with this.

729
01:09:40,666 --> 01:09:42,166
Here, take your money.

730
01:09:42,291 --> 01:09:43,833
Take your money and go, please.

731
01:09:43,958 --> 01:09:45,041
Please leave me.

732
01:09:45,166 --> 01:09:47,000
Go! Go!

733
01:10:03,958 --> 01:10:05,708
You want to stop
and have some coffee?

734
01:10:08,166 --> 01:10:09,416
Okay.

735
01:10:23,541 --> 01:10:24,708
Thank you.

736
01:10:24,833 --> 01:10:26,625
Won't you have some?
- No.

737
01:10:32,708 --> 01:10:33,875
What are you thinking?

738
01:10:36,458 --> 01:10:37,791
What can I think about?

739
01:10:39,083 --> 01:10:41,166
Frankly,
I don't even know what to think.

740
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:45,958
Shaina,
I think you should go back.

741
01:10:47,750 --> 01:10:49,083
Your life is in danger here.

742
01:10:58,916 --> 01:11:00,208
Where will I go?

743
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:03,291
Where can I go
where Rehaan's not there?

744
01:11:04,625 --> 01:11:05,708
Go back to India.

745
01:11:05,833 --> 01:11:08,875
I fought for 6 months
with him to come here.

746
01:11:09,375 --> 01:11:12,458
What will I say to him?
Why do I want to go back?

747
01:11:19,375 --> 01:11:22,500
Why do you have to
tell anyone or tell him?

748
01:11:23,791 --> 01:11:25,750
He didn't tell you
when he did all this.

749
01:11:27,208 --> 01:11:28,666
I'll book your tickets.

750
01:11:29,166 --> 01:11:30,333
Just leave. Disappear.

751
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:37,375
So now the situation is

752
01:11:38,041 --> 01:11:40,875
if I try to save my life,
I'll never find out the truth.

753
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,833
And if I try to find the truth,
I will end up losing my life.

754
01:11:44,416 --> 01:11:46,916
Truth or death. Great choice!

755
01:11:53,208 --> 01:11:54,375
Choose life.

756
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,458
No, I choose the truth!

757
01:12:04,791 --> 01:12:07,750
I won't wander around anymore
to find the truth.

758
01:12:08,208 --> 01:12:09,875
There's only one way.

759
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,666
Rehaan must answer my questions.

760
01:12:14,458 --> 01:12:15,791
Let's go, Aditya.

761
01:12:16,333 --> 01:12:18,750
I want to put an end
to this game of hide and seek.

762
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:20,625
This is it.

763
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:28,958
What the hell?

764
01:12:31,625 --> 01:12:32,833
Wait, let me check.

765
01:12:45,750 --> 01:12:46,791
What's wrong?

766
01:12:47,291 --> 01:12:48,958
Something has damaged
the radiator.

767
01:12:49,458 --> 01:12:51,000
And the coolant's leaked out.

768
01:12:51,416 --> 01:12:52,916
We'll have to get it soldered.

769
01:12:53,375 --> 01:12:55,750
But it's late now,
how are we going to get it done?

770
01:12:56,500 --> 01:12:57,625
I don't know.

771
01:12:59,333 --> 01:13:01,291
I think we'll have
to stay here tonight.

772
01:13:02,625 --> 01:13:03,708
Huh!

773
01:13:04,583 --> 01:13:06,333
But I must get back, Aditya.

774
01:13:06,458 --> 01:13:07,583
I don't want Rehaan to think
that in his absence..

775
01:13:07,708 --> 01:13:08,916
Rehaan is out of town.

776
01:13:09,541 --> 01:13:12,041
You will get home
before he does. I promise.

777
01:13:12,541 --> 01:13:14,583
But we can't drive
with a busted radiator.

778
01:13:14,708 --> 01:13:16,375
If the engine seizes,
we're done for.

779
01:13:17,791 --> 01:13:19,000
Hey, listen.

780
01:13:19,375 --> 01:13:20,375
Hmm?

781
01:13:21,708 --> 01:13:25,125
I'll never harm you in any way.
Trust me.

782
01:13:34,916 --> 01:13:36,083
You know

783
01:13:36,208 --> 01:13:37,958
there's a line
in a poem by Tagore.

784
01:13:38,083 --> 01:13:39,833
We Bengalis know it really well.

785
01:13:41,125 --> 01:13:43,666
"Where have you brought me?"

786
01:13:45,291 --> 01:13:49,375
It means "What strange
path led you to me"?

787
01:13:52,416 --> 01:13:56,083
Honestly speaking
you're the only one I trust now.

788
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:37,208
"The way you blossom
when I arrive."

789
01:14:37,666 --> 01:14:42,250
"The way you get teased
when I leave."

790
01:14:42,791 --> 01:14:46,416
"The way you would bruise
when I touched you."

791
01:14:46,541 --> 01:14:48,958
"Do you remember?"

792
01:14:51,958 --> 01:14:58,083
"The way you melted
when I came close."

793
01:14:58,208 --> 01:15:02,958
"And the way you would
trickle down on me."

794
01:15:03,375 --> 01:15:07,041
"And the way you made me yearn."

795
01:15:07,166 --> 01:15:09,416
"Do you remember?"

796
01:15:09,750 --> 01:15:12,166
"Do you remember?"

797
01:15:12,291 --> 01:15:14,875
"Do you remember?"

798
01:15:34,166 --> 01:15:39,208
"The way you opened
my eyes with your lips."

799
01:15:39,333 --> 01:15:44,333
"And alleviate my pain
with your eyes."

800
01:15:44,458 --> 01:15:49,000
"Leaving all the sorrows
under the sheets."

801
01:15:49,541 --> 01:15:54,208
"The slumber lying
on your pillow."

802
01:15:54,750 --> 01:15:59,583
"And the nights that
dissolved in your slumber."

803
01:15:59,875 --> 01:16:03,583
"And the way you
sighed on those nights."

804
01:16:03,708 --> 01:16:05,833
"Do you remember?"

805
01:16:06,291 --> 01:16:08,750
"Do you remember?"

806
01:16:08,875 --> 01:16:11,583
"Do you remember?"

807
01:16:41,083 --> 01:16:46,083
"Come under the moon again."

808
01:16:46,208 --> 01:16:51,208
"We'll glow together."

809
01:16:51,333 --> 01:16:55,875
"And douse together."

810
01:16:56,416 --> 01:17:01,500
"The way you blossom
when I arrive."

811
01:17:01,625 --> 01:17:06,583
"The way you get teased
when I leave."

812
01:17:06,708 --> 01:17:10,375
"The way you would bruise
when I touched you."

813
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:13,416
"Do you remember?"

814
01:17:17,083 --> 01:17:22,041
"The way you melted
whenever I came close."

815
01:17:22,166 --> 01:17:27,000
"And the way you would trickle
down on me."

816
01:17:27,333 --> 01:17:30,958
"And the way you made me yearn."

817
01:17:31,083 --> 01:17:33,500
"Do you remember?"

818
01:17:37,666 --> 01:17:42,583
"The way you melted
whenever I came close."

819
01:17:42,708 --> 01:17:47,791
"And the way you would trickle
down on me."

820
01:17:47,916 --> 01:17:51,583
"And the way you made me yearn."

821
01:17:51,708 --> 01:17:54,166
"Do you remember?"

822
01:17:54,291 --> 01:17:56,791
"Do you remember?"

823
01:17:56,916 --> 01:17:59,500
"Do you remember?"

824
01:18:35,166 --> 01:18:37,791
<i>Hey, going to fix the radiator.</i>

825
01:18:38,375 --> 01:18:39,541
<i>Back in one hour.</i>

826
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:48,750
If I was not interrupted

827
01:20:49,458 --> 01:20:50,916
we could've found out
how Shaina

828
01:20:51,041 --> 01:20:53,041
got to the phone booth
from the hotel room.

829
01:20:53,958 --> 01:20:56,125
But unfortunately..

830
01:20:58,291 --> 01:20:59,500
I know.

831
01:21:05,333 --> 01:21:07,708
Who did you kill?
- What?

832
01:21:10,791 --> 01:21:13,250
Who did you kill?
- I didn't kill anyone.

833
01:21:13,875 --> 01:21:16,166
Look, Rehaan,
you can at least be honest here.

834
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:18,958
If you hide the truth from us,
we cannot help you.

835
01:21:19,083 --> 01:21:21,041
For God's sake, Aman,
why would I murder someone?

836
01:21:22,916 --> 01:21:23,666
What's wrong with you guys?

837
01:21:23,791 --> 01:21:24,916
Do I look like
a murderer to you?

838
01:21:25,041 --> 01:21:26,583
Can't you see
Aditya's manipulated all this?

839
01:21:26,708 --> 01:21:27,833
Manipulate?

840
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:29,333
How, Rehaan?

841
01:21:29,458 --> 01:21:31,208
He sent that spirit
in this house.

842
01:21:31,333 --> 01:21:33,208
Either he used black magic
or he hired a professional.

843
01:21:33,333 --> 01:21:35,750
Remember that gypsy woman?
He took Shaina to her.

844
01:21:35,875 --> 01:21:37,416
He always wanted
Shaina back in his life.

845
01:21:37,541 --> 01:21:39,458
He's done all this
to get her back.

846
01:21:39,583 --> 01:21:41,958
It's a simple plan.
Can't you guys see?

847
01:21:42,708 --> 01:21:44,166
First, plague this
house with a Strigoi

848
01:21:44,291 --> 01:21:46,083
then look to Shaina as a savior.

849
01:21:46,208 --> 01:21:47,625
First he saved her
and won her trust

850
01:21:47,750 --> 01:21:49,291
and then made me the villain!

851
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,083
My clothes behind the wall?

852
01:21:51,208 --> 01:21:53,500
I mean really!
It's a cheap trick, guys!

853
01:21:53,625 --> 01:21:55,958
Anyone can steal my clothes from
the laundry and keep it there.

854
01:21:57,791 --> 01:21:59,041
And Shaina.

855
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,166
She just fell for this nonsense.

856
01:22:04,666 --> 01:22:05,708
Hmm.

857
01:22:07,125 --> 01:22:08,250
It's possible.

858
01:22:09,625 --> 01:22:11,458
Because if he's done all this

859
01:22:12,750 --> 01:22:15,375
then it was easy
for him to say

860
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:17,916
that he saw everything
in his dreams.

861
01:22:18,333 --> 01:22:21,708
What a jerk!
- Then we must find this jerk.

862
01:22:21,833 --> 01:22:24,916
And we must tell him to reverse
everything he's done.

863
01:22:25,041 --> 01:22:26,583
What difference will that make?

864
01:22:27,375 --> 01:22:28,375
What can I do?

865
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:30,333
He's already done
what he wanted to.

866
01:22:30,916 --> 01:22:33,458
He slept with my wife and he's
almost broken up my marriage.

867
01:22:33,916 --> 01:22:35,083
What will I do if I find him?

868
01:22:35,208 --> 01:22:39,708
Beg him. Plead him to reverse
whatever black magic he's done.

869
01:22:40,208 --> 01:22:43,916
He can't do anything
even if he wants.

870
01:22:45,041 --> 01:22:46,166
He can't reverse it.

871
01:22:46,541 --> 01:22:48,333
Then who can reverse it?

872
01:23:23,625 --> 01:23:27,916
Shaina is sleeping.

873
01:23:54,666 --> 01:23:56,250
Exorcism.

874
01:23:58,625 --> 01:24:02,166
It's not easy to get permission
for an exorcism.

875
01:24:03,125 --> 01:24:06,375
The Church is very strict
about these things.

876
01:24:06,666 --> 01:24:08,291
But that's the only way
to get this Strigoi

877
01:24:08,416 --> 01:24:09,833
out of the poor girl.

878
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:15,625
Also I don't think
her body can take the attack

879
01:24:15,750 --> 01:24:17,416
of this evil any longer.

880
01:24:18,458 --> 01:24:19,666
She will die.

881
01:24:21,166 --> 01:24:22,541
I understand but..

882
01:24:22,666 --> 01:24:25,291
I am bound by the rules
of the Church.

883
01:24:26,958 --> 01:24:29,666
But there is one thing
I can do.

884
01:24:31,250 --> 01:24:36,041
If we can deliver some
kind of proof to the Church.

885
01:24:37,750 --> 01:24:41,000
We might be able to
convince the archdiocese

886
01:24:41,125 --> 01:24:43,708
to help with their intervention.

887
01:24:44,125 --> 01:24:45,541
What kind of proof can it be?

888
01:24:50,208 --> 01:24:52,875
I shall attempt to talk
to this Strigoi

889
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,333
that takes control
of the little girl.

890
01:25:00,416 --> 01:25:03,625
I hope we can record
the proceeding.

891
01:25:05,833 --> 01:25:08,041
I'll record it myself.
You need not worry.

892
01:25:12,958 --> 01:25:16,750
In that case,
we can start.

893
01:25:28,166 --> 01:25:30,916
Facing a Strigoi is not easy.

894
01:25:31,625 --> 01:25:33,250
Whatever happens

895
01:25:33,375 --> 01:25:36,833
no one but me
talks to the spirit.

896
01:25:45,291 --> 01:25:48,791
By the power vested on me
by the Church

897
01:25:49,500 --> 01:25:56,166
in the name of our Lord Jesus,
evil soul, show yourself.

898
01:25:56,291 --> 01:25:57,750
I command you.

899
01:26:00,708 --> 01:26:06,791
By the power of Jesus Christ,
show yourself, evil one.

900
01:26:09,916 --> 01:26:12,625
Tell us, who are you?

901
01:26:15,250 --> 01:26:22,166
In the name of our Lord,
I command you, show yourself.

902
01:26:42,208 --> 01:26:43,583
Take a seat.

903
01:26:55,958 --> 01:26:59,125
Who are you? Tell us.

904
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:07,583
What do you seek?

905
01:27:08,833 --> 01:27:12,625
In the name of our Father,
reveal yourself.

906
01:27:31,583 --> 01:27:34,208
Our Father, who art in Heaven

907
01:27:34,333 --> 01:27:35,833
hallowed be thy name.

908
01:27:35,958 --> 01:27:40,333
Thy Kingdom come,
Thy will be done.

909
01:27:40,458 --> 01:27:41,958
On earth, as it is in Heaven.

910
01:27:42,083 --> 01:27:44,333
Give us this day
our daily bread.

911
01:27:44,750 --> 01:27:46,916
And forgive us our trespasses.

912
01:27:47,166 --> 01:27:50,958
As we forgive those
who trespass against us.

913
01:27:55,250 --> 01:27:57,541
And lead us not into temptation.

914
01:27:57,666 --> 01:27:59,458
But deliver us from evil.

915
01:27:59,583 --> 01:28:04,250
For thine is the kingdom
and glory forever and more.

916
01:28:06,500 --> 01:28:09,458
The power of Christ
commands you!

917
01:28:09,583 --> 01:28:11,166
Show yourself.

918
01:28:11,291 --> 01:28:15,375
You beast. Show yourself!

919
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:17,708
You follower of Satan.

920
01:28:17,833 --> 01:28:20,500
Show yourself
to the God Almighty.

921
01:28:20,625 --> 01:28:24,458
Show yourself
in the name of God.

922
01:28:37,333 --> 01:28:38,375
Shreya.

923
01:29:10,833 --> 01:29:12,291
Bloody Sinner!

924
01:29:15,083 --> 01:29:17,291
Fucking little boys, huh!

925
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:21,166
They threw you out of the
diocese in Milano, did they not?

926
01:29:21,666 --> 01:29:23,083
What is this?

927
01:29:24,875 --> 01:29:26,208
What do you know?

928
01:29:27,083 --> 01:29:30,000
It's not me. It's not true.

929
01:29:35,458 --> 01:29:36,958
What was his name?

930
01:29:37,583 --> 01:29:41,166
Fernando. Choir boy.

931
01:29:42,208 --> 01:29:45,041
The one with the pink lips.

932
01:29:45,875 --> 01:29:49,000
Son of Satan, is not true!

933
01:29:49,583 --> 01:29:51,708
You are a liar. How dare you!

934
01:29:53,583 --> 01:29:55,500
You come to me you, whore man!
Have you not read

935
01:29:55,625 --> 01:29:57,250
follow peace with all his men
and holiness

936
01:29:57,375 --> 01:29:58,875
without which no man
shall see the Lord.

937
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,208
You have no God.
You're my brother.

938
01:30:01,333 --> 01:30:03,541
You're with us,
with us in our kingdom.

939
01:30:03,666 --> 01:30:06,125
You pray to my father,
to Lucifer.

940
01:30:06,250 --> 01:30:08,750
You are perverse like no other,
tell me!

941
01:30:13,083 --> 01:30:15,000
Come to me, you unclean spirit.

942
01:30:15,125 --> 01:30:16,333
Come to our kingdom.

943
01:30:16,458 --> 01:30:19,208
The majesty of Lucifer
awaits you.

944
01:30:42,583 --> 01:30:44,125
It's evil!

945
01:30:44,458 --> 01:30:46,375
Powerful spirit, can't fight.

946
01:31:03,625 --> 01:31:05,750
Would you like to meet her?

947
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:20,458
Rehaan, please!

948
01:31:20,583 --> 01:31:25,666
Help, please!
Rehaan, please help me.

949
01:31:25,791 --> 01:31:27,875
Help me.

950
01:31:31,416 --> 01:31:32,666
Please.

951
01:31:42,250 --> 01:31:45,208
Rehaan. Rehaan.

952
01:31:46,083 --> 01:31:47,375
Rehaan.

953
01:31:52,375 --> 01:31:53,583
Rehaan.

954
01:31:56,375 --> 01:32:01,291
Please help me, Rehaan.
You know everything..

955
01:32:02,958 --> 01:32:04,333
Rehaan.

956
01:32:05,625 --> 01:32:08,333
You know everything, Rehaan.

957
01:32:08,458 --> 01:32:09,791
Please help me.

958
01:32:17,208 --> 01:32:19,041
Rehaan.
- Rehaan, are you all right?

959
01:32:45,500 --> 01:32:47,666
You cannot take her away!

960
01:33:09,833 --> 01:33:11,041
<i>You're right, Shaina.</i>

961
01:33:13,500 --> 01:33:14,958
<i>I know everything.</i>

962
01:33:16,708 --> 01:33:21,166
<i>I know everything...
because I did all this.</i>

963
01:33:22,708 --> 01:33:24,291
<i>It is all my fault.</i>

964
01:33:25,541 --> 01:33:26,791
<i>It's all my fault.</i>

965
01:33:28,166 --> 01:33:29,791
Shaina was right all along.

966
01:33:31,375 --> 01:33:34,041
The distance between us
was due to the secret

967
01:33:35,375 --> 01:33:37,291
which I've been hiding
all these years.

968
01:33:38,583 --> 01:33:39,958
It was four years back.

969
01:33:42,666 --> 01:33:44,166
We were about to get married.

970
01:33:46,708 --> 01:33:48,083
We were still in Romania.

971
01:33:48,625 --> 01:33:51,041
<i>Son, I had sent a 'mangalsutra'.
Did you get it?</i>

972
01:33:51,166 --> 01:33:52,375
No, when did you send it?

973
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:53,708
Stop being a fool.

974
01:33:53,833 --> 01:33:56,416
Mom, your son's stupid
and forgetful too.

975
01:33:56,541 --> 01:33:58,125
As soon as I received
your courier

976
01:33:58,250 --> 01:34:01,083
I showed him this 'mangalsutra'
with such excitement

977
01:34:01,208 --> 01:34:03,000
and he stuck his face out of
the computer

978
01:34:03,125 --> 01:34:04,500
and gave a cold reaction.

979
01:34:04,625 --> 01:34:06,791
If you had been here, you
would've given him a tight slap.

980
01:34:06,916 --> 01:34:09,250
If mom was here, she wouldn't
have sent this courier.

981
01:34:09,375 --> 01:34:11,708
<i>Dear, this is no
ordinary 'mangalsutra'.</i>

982
01:34:11,833 --> 01:34:13,958
<i>It's got the blessings
of two mothers.</i>

983
01:34:14,083 --> 01:34:15,875
Two mothers? Meaning.

984
01:34:16,250 --> 01:34:18,750
<i>I took this 'mangalsutra'
to Vaishno Devi.</i>

985
01:34:19,625 --> 01:34:22,041
<i>And had it blessed
by the Goddess.</i>

986
01:34:22,708 --> 01:34:24,125
<i>I have just one wish</i>

987
01:34:24,458 --> 01:34:27,083
<i>that you two get married
here in India, before my eyes.</i>

988
01:34:27,208 --> 01:34:28,625
Please don't start that again.

989
01:34:29,083 --> 01:34:31,083
You know
I won't get any leaves now.

990
01:34:31,208 --> 01:34:33,958
And Shaina's advertising
contract expires after 6 months.

991
01:34:34,291 --> 01:34:35,333
But let's do one thing.

992
01:34:35,458 --> 01:34:38,000
We'll get married again
when we come home in June.

993
01:34:38,125 --> 01:34:41,041
<i>Talking like a fool again.</i>

994
01:34:41,166 --> 01:34:43,208
<i>Marriages are never done twice.</i>

995
01:34:43,333 --> 01:34:46,458
I can marry this cute lady
many times.

996
01:34:46,583 --> 01:34:48,875
Stop flirting with me
in front of your mother.

997
01:34:50,166 --> 01:34:52,291
Mama, listen.
- <i>Yes, dear.</i>

998
01:34:53,666 --> 01:34:54,750
Just a second.

999
01:34:54,875 --> 01:34:57,625
I wanted to ask you..

1000
01:34:58,250 --> 01:34:59,625
Hello.
- Congratulations.

1001
01:35:00,625 --> 01:35:02,791
I heard you're going
to be bound in 'pranay-sutra'.

1002
01:35:02,916 --> 01:35:03,791
'Pranay-sutra?'

1003
01:35:03,916 --> 01:35:05,708
It's a legal name
for Kama sutra.

1004
01:35:06,125 --> 01:35:07,375
Meaning marriage.

1005
01:35:08,125 --> 01:35:10,375
Congratulations on your marriage
in advance, Rehaan.

1006
01:35:10,500 --> 01:35:11,166
Who is this?

1007
01:35:11,291 --> 01:35:14,083
I am the guy who's fucking
your wife before you were.

1008
01:35:17,750 --> 01:35:19,500
This isn't right.

1009
01:35:19,958 --> 01:35:21,750
She didn't tell you about me.

1010
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,500
Perhaps she wants you
to forget a bad memory.

1011
01:35:26,041 --> 01:35:27,625
But I am in no mood to forget.

1012
01:35:27,750 --> 01:35:28,916
You know,
I can have you arrested

1013
01:35:29,041 --> 01:35:30,458
for making this obscene call.

1014
01:35:30,583 --> 01:35:34,708
Cool plan. You commit
the crimes and I go to jail.

1015
01:35:35,208 --> 01:35:36,250
What do you mean?

1016
01:35:36,375 --> 01:35:39,250
Finfuel, Balkan Holdings,
Finance Romania!

1017
01:35:39,916 --> 01:35:42,166
Do these companies ring a bell?

1018
01:35:42,291 --> 01:35:43,541
Who the hell are you?

1019
01:35:43,666 --> 01:35:44,791
Note down the address.

1020
01:35:45,333 --> 01:35:48,416
<i>21 Strada Rennes.
I am waiting for you.</i>

1021
01:36:02,375 --> 01:36:05,000
Hello.
- Come in. Come in.

1022
01:36:10,958 --> 01:36:12,416
Come right in, Mr. Khanna.

1023
01:36:13,041 --> 01:36:14,375
The door to your right.

1024
01:36:22,125 --> 01:36:24,041
Mr. Khanna, welcome.

1025
01:36:25,125 --> 01:36:26,875
So good to finally meet you.

1026
01:36:27,208 --> 01:36:28,750
Please come. Come, come.

1027
01:36:28,875 --> 01:36:31,125
Come in, please.
No formalities.

1028
01:36:48,750 --> 01:36:50,375
Isn't that
a nice picture of Shaina?

1029
01:36:51,375 --> 01:36:52,500
It's my favorite.

1030
01:36:54,916 --> 01:36:56,291
Actually
this is just the half of it.

1031
01:36:56,833 --> 01:36:58,291
The entire picture's
on my laptop.

1032
01:36:59,666 --> 01:37:00,750
She's a model.

1033
01:37:01,666 --> 01:37:03,333
And it's easy for a
cheap fashion photographer

1034
01:37:03,458 --> 01:37:05,708
to mislead an innocent
girl like Shaina.

1035
01:37:06,666 --> 01:37:08,250
I see you've done
your research on me.

1036
01:37:08,583 --> 01:37:09,666
Very good.

1037
01:37:10,291 --> 01:37:12,875
I just love people
who do their homework.

1038
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,166
Even I've done
my homework on you.

1039
01:37:17,583 --> 01:37:18,833
Would you like to see?

1040
01:37:18,958 --> 01:37:20,958
You should see it.
It's going to be fun.

1041
01:37:21,083 --> 01:37:22,125
Excuse me.

1042
01:37:24,041 --> 01:37:25,500
I have to warn you.

1043
01:37:25,625 --> 01:37:28,291
I am a bit slow when it comes
to finance and accounting.

1044
01:37:29,041 --> 01:37:30,666
So please bear with me, yeah?

1045
01:37:32,041 --> 01:37:36,041
So I made some of my finance
detectives do some digging.

1046
01:37:36,583 --> 01:37:39,125
And I found out some very
interesting things about you.

1047
01:37:39,250 --> 01:37:42,375
The three companies which
you started with your fake IDs.

1048
01:37:43,166 --> 01:37:46,250
Finfuel, Balkan Holdings
Finance Romania!

1049
01:37:46,375 --> 01:37:48,083
These three companies
don't actually exist.

1050
01:37:48,625 --> 01:37:50,500
They are paper companies.
It's amazing.

1051
01:37:50,625 --> 01:37:51,708
Huh!

1052
01:37:54,208 --> 01:37:57,500
You started these companies
to manipulate the stock market.

1053
01:37:57,791 --> 01:37:59,625
Later you traded
through these company

1054
01:37:59,750 --> 01:38:02,041
and bought shares of
your existing American company

1055
01:38:02,166 --> 01:38:03,666
just to increase
the share price.

1056
01:38:03,791 --> 01:38:06,416
Now I don't know
much about banking

1057
01:38:06,541 --> 01:38:07,833
but I know

1058
01:38:08,250 --> 01:38:10,125
that's insider trading, man.

1059
01:38:10,250 --> 01:38:12,333
And it's illegal in Romania.
It's a crime.

1060
01:38:12,458 --> 01:38:15,000
What rubbish! It's some
sort of imagination of yours.

1061
01:38:15,125 --> 01:38:16,708
And anyway, I am just an
employee of that company.

1062
01:38:16,833 --> 01:38:18,041
What will I get from all this?

1063
01:38:18,166 --> 01:38:21,583
Well, the police
can ask you that.

1064
01:38:22,583 --> 01:38:24,625
But being the financial
head of the company

1065
01:38:24,750 --> 01:38:26,375
you must take responsibility.

1066
01:38:26,500 --> 01:38:27,541
But you have no proof of this.

1067
01:38:27,666 --> 01:38:29,458
Oh, I have all the proof
in the world.

1068
01:38:29,875 --> 01:38:31,416
It's all here on this laptop.

1069
01:38:31,833 --> 01:38:34,250
Take a seat, be comfortable,
have a drink.

1070
01:38:34,750 --> 01:38:36,333
You can go through all of it.

1071
01:38:48,291 --> 01:38:51,541
Well, this is the
post-Lehman Brothers economy.

1072
01:38:52,208 --> 01:38:53,833
Every big company's doing this.

1073
01:38:53,958 --> 01:38:55,750
There's a huge liquidity
crunch in Romania.

1074
01:38:55,875 --> 01:38:58,958
You see I don't know much
about liquid or solids.

1075
01:38:59,083 --> 01:39:03,166
All I know is
you're guilty if you're caught.

1076
01:39:03,291 --> 01:39:05,666
And Mr. Rehaan Khanna,
you've been caught.

1077
01:39:06,583 --> 01:39:07,833
You'll be jailed
only for few years

1078
01:39:07,958 --> 01:39:09,375
but your punishment..

1079
01:39:10,208 --> 01:39:12,125
Your punishment will last
for a lifetime.

1080
01:39:12,250 --> 01:39:13,833
Your entire career will be over.

1081
01:39:13,958 --> 01:39:15,208
You're screwed, man.

1082
01:39:20,333 --> 01:39:21,416
What do you want?

1083
01:39:25,250 --> 01:39:27,250
I thought we'd never get
to this part.

1084
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:30,625
You're a smart man, Rehaan.

1085
01:39:30,750 --> 01:39:32,125
You're a smart man.

1086
01:39:36,791 --> 01:39:41,166
So I want that you drop
this idea of marriage

1087
01:39:41,625 --> 01:39:43,166
and leave Shaina for me.

1088
01:39:43,500 --> 01:39:46,625
I promise you
I'll keep her really happy.

1089
01:39:47,083 --> 01:39:50,500
In life and in bed.

1090
01:39:53,750 --> 01:39:56,166
Now take the laptop and
get the fuck out of her life.

1091
01:39:58,083 --> 01:40:00,833
And what if I don't do it?
- Then prepare to go to jail.

1092
01:40:01,625 --> 01:40:02,583
How long do you think

1093
01:40:02,708 --> 01:40:05,791
will it take for a scoundrel
like me to get Shaina back?

1094
01:40:06,291 --> 01:40:07,875
Few tears and some emotion.

1095
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:09,791
And she will come running
back to me.

1096
01:40:10,125 --> 01:40:12,250
A girl that can trust me once

1097
01:40:12,375 --> 01:40:14,708
won't take too long
to make her trust me again.

1098
01:40:14,833 --> 01:40:16,000
Not much time.

1099
01:40:20,625 --> 01:40:21,833
Mr. Khanna.

1100
01:40:24,541 --> 01:40:27,125
Do you want to know
how much she trusts me?

1101
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,958
It's going to be fun.
You have to watch this.

1102
01:40:35,541 --> 01:40:37,583
Presenting 'Sex with the Ex'.

1103
01:40:40,750 --> 01:40:42,083
She's very naïve.

1104
01:40:42,541 --> 01:40:44,916
She had no clue when
I was recording this.

1105
01:40:46,166 --> 01:40:47,750
She's hungry for love.

1106
01:40:51,458 --> 01:40:55,000
Now either
you get out of our way.

1107
01:40:55,750 --> 01:40:57,583
Or I will have to
get rid of you.

1108
01:40:58,250 --> 01:41:03,416
Either ways
it will be me and her, together.

1109
01:41:04,791 --> 01:41:07,666
I bet she might resist
because that's what she does.

1110
01:41:09,125 --> 01:41:11,541
But I've always imagined
what it would be like

1111
01:41:13,125 --> 01:41:14,833
to first lay her down
on that bed.

1112
01:41:15,666 --> 01:41:18,500
Then tie her right hand
out to the bed post.

1113
01:41:19,208 --> 01:41:20,416
Then her left hand.

1114
01:41:21,541 --> 01:41:22,708
And kiss her.

1115
01:41:23,833 --> 01:41:25,833
And then spread her legs apart.

1116
01:41:26,833 --> 01:41:28,125
And then you know..

1117
01:41:38,166 --> 01:41:41,333
I killed him. I did it.

1118
01:41:42,875 --> 01:41:44,125
I killed him.

1119
01:41:51,125 --> 01:41:53,041
<i>When Trilok was doing
psychometry</i>

1120
01:41:54,166 --> 01:41:57,083
<i>I thought that
my lies will be exposed.</i>

1121
01:41:57,708 --> 01:41:59,791
But through psychometry
he only saw

1122
01:42:00,750 --> 01:42:02,375
what Shaina saw.

1123
01:42:03,500 --> 01:42:07,958
And Shaina saw what Aditya's
spirit wanted her to see.

1124
01:42:15,750 --> 01:42:17,458
<i>Aditya, the court doesn't
allow you to</i>

1125
01:42:17,583 --> 01:42:19,333
<i>come more than 100 meters
close to me.</i>

1126
01:42:25,375 --> 01:42:27,000
<i>Your 10 minutes start now.</i>

1127
01:42:46,750 --> 01:42:48,166
<i>What will I think?</i>

1128
01:42:49,625 --> 01:42:51,500
<i>Frankly
I don't know what to think.</i>

1129
01:42:52,583 --> 01:42:54,416
I didn't even understand
he was dying.

1130
01:43:10,125 --> 01:43:14,375
I will be dead
but I won't go anywhere.

1131
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:17,458
This is not the end.

1132
01:43:18,750 --> 01:43:20,333
This is just the beginning.

1133
01:43:26,916 --> 01:43:28,250
<i>It was a nightmare.</i>

1134
01:43:29,041 --> 01:43:33,166
<i>It felt like the man that
killed Aditya sometime back</i>

1135
01:43:33,625 --> 01:43:35,208
<i>was not me,
but someone else.</i>

1136
01:43:36,083 --> 01:43:38,958
<i>Just like that
I had become a murderer.</i>

1137
01:43:40,166 --> 01:43:42,458
<i>I could hear police sirens
echoing in my ears.</i>

1138
01:43:42,583 --> 01:43:45,041
<i>I could see myself
in handcuffs.</i>

1139
01:43:45,958 --> 01:43:47,625
<i>What was I going to tell Shaina?</i>

1140
01:43:48,333 --> 01:43:50,625
<i>That I went there
to cover my crimes.</i>

1141
01:43:51,583 --> 01:43:53,458
<i>If I had told Shaina
about Aditya</i>

1142
01:43:53,916 --> 01:43:56,291
<i>then I would have
to tell her everything.</i>

1143
01:43:57,208 --> 01:43:59,375
<i>And I didn't want
to fall in her eyes.</i>

1144
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,583
<i>I didn't want to lose her.</i>

1145
01:44:02,333 --> 01:44:04,208
<i>Aditya was hated by everyone.</i>

1146
01:44:04,708 --> 01:44:06,750
<i>And he was not even
a Romanian citizen.</i>

1147
01:44:07,541 --> 01:44:09,750
<i>He had no friends
or relatives either.</i>

1148
01:44:10,291 --> 01:44:11,625
<i>I was fortunate.</i>

1149
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:13,500
<i>No one missed him</i>

1150
01:44:14,041 --> 01:44:15,958
<i>or filed a missing
person's complaint.</i>

1151
01:44:17,666 --> 01:44:19,000
<i>The owners of my rented
apartment</i>

1152
01:44:19,125 --> 01:44:20,750
<i>were making a fake wall</i>

1153
01:44:21,125 --> 01:44:22,958
<i>to hide all
the water seepage.</i>

1154
01:44:24,166 --> 01:44:27,291
<i>And that's where
I hid my bloodied clothes.</i>

1155
01:44:28,500 --> 01:44:31,708
<i>After reading
what Trilok gave us watching</i>

1156
01:44:31,833 --> 01:44:33,250
<i>through his psychometry</i>

1157
01:44:33,375 --> 01:44:35,500
<i>I understood
Aditya's entire plan.</i>

1158
01:44:36,291 --> 01:44:39,166
<i>He knew
he couldn't touch Shaina</i>

1159
01:44:39,833 --> 01:44:41,666
<i>as long as she's wearing
the 'mangalsutra'.</i>

1160
01:44:42,666 --> 01:44:44,250
<i>That's why he went to the hotel</i>

1161
01:44:44,583 --> 01:44:46,666
<i>took advantage of
Shaina's loneliness</i>

1162
01:44:47,291 --> 01:44:49,250
<i>and made her take
the 'mangalsutra' off.</i>

1163
01:44:49,750 --> 01:44:52,208
<i>Later he took control
of Shaina's body</i>

1164
01:44:52,916 --> 01:44:54,791
<i>and made that
'mangalsutra' disappear.</i>

1165
01:44:55,458 --> 01:44:57,166
<i>When you had
the 'mangalsutra'</i>

1166
01:44:58,166 --> 01:45:00,041
<i>you couldn't find the car.</i>

1167
01:45:00,625 --> 01:45:04,750
<i>Now you found the car,
and lost the 'mangalsutra'.</i>

1168
01:45:05,625 --> 01:45:07,583
<i>I even understood
what happened</i>

1169
01:45:07,708 --> 01:45:09,875
<i>between what Trilok told us</i>

1170
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,750
<i>and finding Shaina
at the phone booth.</i>

1171
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:15,958
Oh my God. It's bleeding.
- <i>The blisters on her hands</i>

1172
01:45:16,291 --> 01:45:19,125
<i>and the burnt wood
where her car was found</i>

1173
01:45:19,250 --> 01:45:20,958
<i>conveyed the entire story.</i>

1174
01:45:21,916 --> 01:45:23,958
<i>Aditya took control of her.</i>

1175
01:45:24,666 --> 01:45:27,750
<i>He went to the spot
where I had buried him</i>

1176
01:45:27,875 --> 01:45:29,875
<i>and made Shaina
dig his grave.</i>

1177
01:45:30,500 --> 01:45:32,250
<i>He dug his body out</i>

1178
01:45:33,125 --> 01:45:35,958
<i>and performed
the final rites.</i>

1179
01:45:37,625 --> 01:45:41,166
<i>He closed all that paths that
could separate him from Shaina.</i>

1180
01:45:43,083 --> 01:45:45,333
I have no one but myself
to blame for this.

1181
01:45:46,291 --> 01:45:47,583
I have done this to her.

1182
01:45:48,125 --> 01:45:49,541
It's all my fault.

1183
01:45:51,166 --> 01:45:52,583
I have done this to her.

1184
01:45:55,500 --> 01:45:57,333
Don't be so hard on yourself,
Rehaan.

1185
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:01,833
Anyone else in your place
would've done the same thing.

1186
01:46:02,208 --> 01:46:04,583
You killed a man
who deserved to be killed.

1187
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:06,708
Get yourself together.

1188
01:46:06,833 --> 01:46:08,166
Shaina needs you.

1189
01:46:08,708 --> 01:46:10,708
You saved her from Aditya
in the past.

1190
01:46:10,833 --> 01:46:13,875
And even now you must
save her from Aditya.

1191
01:46:14,750 --> 01:46:18,875
Don't you see, Aman?
I've already lost.

1192
01:46:20,875 --> 01:46:22,500
Aditya has defeated me.

1193
01:46:23,666 --> 01:46:26,458
If I can't cure her,
Aditya will take her with him.

1194
01:46:27,125 --> 01:46:28,666
And if Shaina's cured

1195
01:46:29,625 --> 01:46:32,166
she will know that her
husband's committed a murder.

1196
01:46:32,625 --> 01:46:34,708
In both the situations,
I have lost her.

1197
01:47:09,416 --> 01:47:18,000
"Whatever was between us
is over now."

1198
01:47:18,125 --> 01:47:25,583
"I was left alone
at the last corner."

1199
01:47:26,916 --> 01:47:34,000
"I tried hard to save it"

1200
01:47:34,125 --> 01:47:42,666
"but first my home, and then
my heart was burnt down."

1201
01:47:44,458 --> 01:47:52,666
"The secret
I buried in my heart"

1202
01:47:53,333 --> 01:48:00,833
"finally trickled down
my eyes."

1203
01:48:26,333 --> 01:48:34,625
"You're still the same for me,
nothing's changed for me."

1204
01:48:35,208 --> 01:48:43,041
"It's just fate playing games,
nothing's gone wrong yet."

1205
01:48:43,875 --> 01:48:51,083
"For my sake take me
to that same place again."

1206
01:48:51,333 --> 01:48:59,750
"O benefactor of mine,
heal my wounds."

1207
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:07,458
"I'm sinking
in the depths of pain."

1208
01:49:32,791 --> 01:49:36,666
Shaina, I heard what you said.

1209
01:49:38,500 --> 01:49:40,708
And I know you can hear me too.

1210
01:49:42,583 --> 01:49:45,083
We swore to live
and die together.

1211
01:49:46,500 --> 01:49:48,208
But I forgot them.

1212
01:49:51,041 --> 01:49:53,750
But I swear
I will bring you back.

1213
01:49:56,041 --> 01:49:58,291
Even if I have to
lay down my life.

1214
01:50:05,791 --> 01:50:08,208
It was important to meet
outside the house.

1215
01:50:08,916 --> 01:50:10,958
Because evil has strong ears.

1216
01:50:12,208 --> 01:50:14,041
Gajendra Moksh Strotram.

1217
01:50:14,875 --> 01:50:17,250
Just like the 'Hanuman Chalisa'
is a prayer to Lord Hanuman

1218
01:50:17,375 --> 01:50:19,333
similar this is a
'chant' of Lord Vishnu.

1219
01:50:19,625 --> 01:50:22,458
More powerful than
the 'Vishnu Shahastra-Naam'.

1220
01:50:23,166 --> 01:50:26,666
<i>This is a chant
that can be used</i>

1221
01:50:26,791 --> 01:50:29,333
when you're in the
grip of a powerful evil.

1222
01:50:29,458 --> 01:50:31,791
Even Shaina is in the grip
of a powerful evil.

1223
01:50:34,291 --> 01:50:36,000
<i>Through chanting this
powerful mantra</i>

1224
01:50:36,458 --> 01:50:40,666
we'll force that powerful evil
to leave Shaina's body.

1225
01:50:41,541 --> 01:50:44,375
But there is a condition.
- What condition?

1226
01:50:44,500 --> 01:50:48,458
That chant has to be said
without a break.

1227
01:50:49,708 --> 01:50:51,208
It's called
without any interruption.

1228
01:50:51,625 --> 01:50:53,166
But it won't be easy.

1229
01:50:54,125 --> 01:50:57,916
Aditya's spirit will try
to obstruct it.

1230
01:50:58,916 --> 01:51:01,000
<i>But if we want to save Shaina</i>

1231
01:51:01,125 --> 01:51:03,833
<i>we must complete saying
this mantra.</i>

1232
01:51:04,750 --> 01:51:08,333
"Om!"

1233
01:53:21,791 --> 01:53:24,666
Are you okay?
Come.

1234
01:53:34,291 --> 01:53:36,208
Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you.

1235
01:53:36,333 --> 01:53:37,875
Finish you.

1236
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:41,208
Fuck, fuck, fuck! Finish him.

1237
01:53:41,333 --> 01:53:43,875
Finish him. Finish him.

1238
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:47,458
Finish, finish, finish him.

1239
01:53:47,583 --> 01:53:50,041
Aman, get some hot water fast.
- Yes, I'll go get it.

1240
01:53:52,416 --> 01:53:53,708
Fuck you.

1241
01:55:24,250 --> 01:55:25,541
God!

1242
01:55:26,958 --> 01:55:27,875
Rehaan.

1243
01:55:29,250 --> 01:55:30,375
It's okay..

1244
01:55:30,875 --> 01:55:32,125
It's okay.

1245
01:55:33,750 --> 01:55:35,208
Wait. I'll be back.

1246
01:56:03,416 --> 01:56:05,125
Shreya.

1247
01:56:10,916 --> 01:56:12,541
Pick her up. Pick her up.

1248
01:56:16,291 --> 01:56:19,208
Aman, take her to the hospital.
Go on. - It's okay.

1249
01:56:19,333 --> 01:56:20,666
Rehaan, I can't leave you.

1250
01:56:20,791 --> 01:56:22,750
Are you mad? I'll handle it.
Just go right away.

1251
01:56:22,875 --> 01:56:25,041
Rehaan is right. We should go
to the hospital. Let's go.

1252
01:56:25,958 --> 01:56:27,083
Go!

1253
01:57:19,583 --> 01:57:21,416
Didn't I tell you, Rehaan?

1254
01:57:22,708 --> 01:57:24,500
These secrets will separate us.

1255
01:57:26,791 --> 01:57:28,125
Now we're separated.

1256
01:57:29,958 --> 01:57:31,625
He will take me away.

1257
01:57:33,875 --> 01:57:35,708
He'll take my soul with him.

1258
01:57:38,625 --> 01:57:40,375
I won't let anything
happen to you

1259
01:57:40,500 --> 01:57:42,333
and he can't take you anywhere.

1260
01:57:42,750 --> 01:57:44,791
He defeated me once,
but he can't defeat me again.

1261
01:57:44,916 --> 01:57:46,041
I can.

1262
01:57:47,708 --> 01:57:50,375
Not once, I can defeat you
every time I want.

1263
01:57:51,416 --> 01:57:53,541
You're a fucking coward, Rehaan.

1264
01:57:53,666 --> 01:57:54,833
You're a coward!

1265
01:57:55,125 --> 01:57:57,166
You took my life
to hide your secrets.

1266
01:57:57,750 --> 01:57:59,916
You buried my body
to escape arrest.

1267
01:58:00,416 --> 01:58:01,541
And then you stole
Shaina's smile

1268
01:58:01,666 --> 01:58:03,000
due to the fear
of coming to Romania.

1269
01:58:03,125 --> 01:58:04,083
You cannot save her.

1270
01:58:04,208 --> 01:58:05,666
I know you're trying
to do the same thing

1271
01:58:05,791 --> 01:58:07,333
that you tried to do
at your home that day.

1272
01:58:07,458 --> 01:58:08,750
You provoked me
with your words

1273
01:58:08,875 --> 01:58:10,791
and turned me into you
into a murderer.

1274
01:58:11,333 --> 01:58:12,708
But I won't
let you succeed today.

1275
01:58:12,833 --> 01:58:14,583
My God's with me today.

1276
01:58:15,083 --> 01:58:16,916
Don't be ridiculous, Rehaan.

1277
01:58:17,541 --> 01:58:19,958
Your God's been dead for ages.

1278
01:58:20,250 --> 01:58:21,333
He's dead.

1279
01:58:21,458 --> 01:58:22,791
Dead! Dead! Dead!

1280
01:58:23,166 --> 01:58:24,916
If your God existed

1281
01:58:25,333 --> 01:58:27,375
then how can I be here
even after I am dead?

1282
01:58:27,500 --> 01:58:29,458
If there's a Satan like you,
then there's definitely a God

1283
01:58:29,583 --> 01:58:31,000
and He will stop you.

1284
01:58:31,125 --> 01:58:32,500
My God will stop you.

1285
01:58:32,625 --> 01:58:33,833
I see!

1286
01:58:34,375 --> 01:58:36,500
He didn't stop me

1287
01:58:36,625 --> 01:58:37,958
when I made Shaina
take off her 'mangalsutra'.

1288
01:58:38,083 --> 01:58:40,250
I took her clothes off

1289
01:58:40,375 --> 01:58:41,750
and He didn't stop me
then either.

1290
01:58:41,875 --> 01:58:45,250
I took her to my bedroom
and made love to her all night

1291
01:58:45,916 --> 01:58:47,625
but He didn't stop me
then either.

1292
01:58:47,750 --> 01:58:50,666
I possessed her body
and made her mine.

1293
01:58:51,750 --> 01:58:52,666
But He didn't stop me.

1294
01:58:52,791 --> 01:58:55,541
And tomorrow morning
I'll take her soul with me.

1295
01:58:56,250 --> 01:58:57,708
And He won't stop me.

1296
01:58:59,375 --> 01:59:01,166
You know, Rehaan,
I was thinking.

1297
01:59:01,666 --> 01:59:06,083
If God exists, then He's like
those cops in old films

1298
01:59:06,208 --> 01:59:08,708
who arrive after
everything's over.

1299
01:59:11,125 --> 01:59:12,625
When I was a kid,
my mother used to say

1300
01:59:12,750 --> 01:59:15,375
that God will punish
the evil.

1301
01:59:15,916 --> 01:59:17,458
But when I grew up,
I realized

1302
01:59:17,583 --> 01:59:19,125
that God punishes no one.

1303
01:59:19,750 --> 01:59:21,166
And the truth is

1304
01:59:21,541 --> 01:59:25,833
if you're not bad,
the world will punish you.

1305
01:59:35,750 --> 01:59:37,041
See for it yourself.

1306
01:59:37,500 --> 01:59:40,500
Rehaan the nice guy
is standing here helplessly.

1307
01:59:41,083 --> 01:59:43,416
And Aditya Srivastav
the bad guy

1308
01:59:43,541 --> 01:59:45,875
is lying in the bed
with his wife.

1309
01:59:47,708 --> 01:59:51,041
This is bad for your
God's reputation, Rehaan.

1310
01:59:51,333 --> 01:59:53,375
Don't you think?
Very, very bad.

1311
01:59:53,500 --> 01:59:54,833
What kind of a husband are you?

1312
01:59:54,958 --> 01:59:57,333
Doesn't your blood boil
watching Shaina in my arms?

1313
01:59:57,458 --> 01:59:59,208
Don't you get angry?

1314
02:00:00,166 --> 02:00:02,416
Do you know
what I would've done?

1315
02:00:02,541 --> 02:00:03,750
I would've picked up this lamp

1316
02:00:03,875 --> 02:00:05,791
and hit it hard
on my wife's head.

1317
02:00:05,916 --> 02:00:07,166
I'd fucking kill her!

1318
02:00:07,291 --> 02:00:08,666
And not recite some chant
and save her.

1319
02:00:08,791 --> 02:00:10,750
Come on, Rehaan,
pick the lamp up.

1320
02:00:10,875 --> 02:00:12,416
Hit it on your wife's head.

1321
02:00:12,541 --> 02:00:15,500
Come on, Rehaan.
I know you wanna do it.

1322
02:00:15,625 --> 02:00:18,333
Come on, lift this lamp,
hit it on her head.

1323
02:00:18,458 --> 02:00:19,916
Come on, you fucking coward.

1324
02:00:20,041 --> 02:00:22,458
Pick up this lamp and
hit it on your wife's head.

1325
02:00:22,583 --> 02:00:23,916
Come on, pick it up!

1326
02:00:24,041 --> 02:00:26,375
Pick it up, you fucking coward!
Pick up this lamp!

1327
02:00:41,500 --> 02:00:42,916
I won't let this happen.

1328
02:00:43,458 --> 02:00:45,958
I won't let you fill my heart
with hatred instead of love.

1329
02:00:46,625 --> 02:00:48,375
My love is my God.

1330
02:00:48,500 --> 02:00:51,583
And as long as my love's alive,
God still exists.

1331
02:04:24,458 --> 02:04:25,875
What are you thinking, Shai?

1332
02:04:26,500 --> 02:04:31,041
When we came here,
the entire lake was frozen.

1333
02:04:36,500 --> 02:04:40,916
All the ice has melted now,
right?

1334
02:04:43,333 --> 02:04:46,333
Yes, all the ice has melted.

1335
02:04:46,666 --> 02:04:55,125
"Your mysterious eyes
are conveying everything."

1336
02:04:55,458 --> 02:05:03,375
"The heart's listening
to your silence."

1337
02:05:04,250 --> 02:05:08,541
"Don't say a word, just listen."

1338
02:05:08,666 --> 02:05:12,958
"Stay close to me."

1339
02:05:13,083 --> 02:05:20,083
"Such are the
mystical depths of love."

1340
02:05:21,875 --> 02:05:30,250
"The soul can never
stay apart from the body."

1341
02:05:30,708 --> 02:05:38,375
"No matter how strong
the winds blow."

1342
02:05:39,125 --> 02:05:47,791
"Your mysterious eyes
are conveying everything."

1343
02:05:47,916 --> 02:05:55,291
"The heart's listening
to your silence."

1344
02:06:24,125 --> 02:06:27,875
"You're my reason
to stay alive."

1345
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:31,916
"You're my light."

1346
02:06:32,916 --> 02:06:40,208
"Every gleaming star says
you're my moonlight."

1347
02:06:41,625 --> 02:06:48,458
"We can never part ways."

1348
02:06:48,916 --> 02:06:57,625
"You're my sunlight
and my shadow."

1349
02:06:57,750 --> 02:07:04,791
"When you're close,
loneliness stays away."
