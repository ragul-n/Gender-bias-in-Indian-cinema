Girls, this is Bhangra.

81
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:41,167
Wrestling, Kabaddi and Bhangra.
They all require energy.

82
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:43,708
Try and match Jaggi's energy.

83
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:45,917
Coach, none of the girls can keep up.

84
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:48,958
They're busy with WhatsApp,
coffee dates and etcetera.

85
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,458
Nobody wants to practice.

86
00:07:50,542 --> 00:07:53,333
But half of them WhatsApp you all day.

87
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,625
Coffee dates also seem to be with you.

88
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:59,792
If they can't match your speed,
then why don't you slow down?

89
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:00,708
Me?

90
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,000
-I must compromise on quality, sir?
-Come on!

91
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:05,292
Do it, Jaggi.

92
00:08:05,667 --> 00:08:08,542
Yeah, man. We're stuck on the
first act for four days now.

93
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:09,958
And, if you slow down

94
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,958
then I can be your lead dancer.

95
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:13,542
How kind of you!

96
00:08:14,917 --> 00:08:16,583
All of you need to level up.

97
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:20,167
If folks back home find out

98
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:23,375
that I compromised
because I couldn't find a lead dancer,

99
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:25,417
do you know how embarrassing it'll be?

100
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:28,375
Coach...

101
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:32,125
Please find someone good.

102
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:34,208
Or we won't make it to London.

103
00:08:42,917 --> 00:08:45,917
Boys, it's quite late.

104
00:08:47,667 --> 00:08:49,830
Hurry up, boys. Come on.

105
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,292
Boys, let's go.

106
00:08:57,542 --> 00:08:58,542
Get the console out.

107
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,333
Hide!

108
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:11,458
Hurry up, boys.

109
00:09:11,542 --> 00:09:13,417
Come on, it's time for bed.

110
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:15,958
Hurry up. You too. Very good.

111
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,500
-Good night, sir.
-Good night.

112
00:09:20,542 --> 00:09:22,708
Lights off. Time for bed.

113
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:24,458
Come on now.

114
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,208
You'll get me killed, Mom.
Hang on.

115
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,125
I swear, I was about to call you.

116
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:52,000
Your number just popped up on my phone,
so I thought I'll call you.

117
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:53,458
Yeah right, liar!

118
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,458
You just have only my number.

119
00:10:00,292 --> 00:10:01,833
Your son sends you his regards.

120
00:10:02,667 --> 00:10:03,583
When did I do that?

121
00:10:04,417 --> 00:10:07,500
-Your father sends his blessings.
-When did I say that?

122
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:09,958
Fine.

123
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:13,708
The son didn't send his regards
nor did the father his blessings.

124
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:15,958
-I'm the only fool here.
-Mom...

125
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:18,458
I miss you.

126
00:10:19,542 --> 00:10:23,417
But it's pointless trying to
get us to talk.

127
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:24,708
Why?

128
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,958
Because your husband is an ordinary guy

129
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,667
and your son is a star.

130
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,167
Yeah, star!

131
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:31,625
You'll get one tight slap.

132
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:34,208
I'm hanging up, okay? Bye.
I love you, bye!

133
00:10:34,417 --> 00:10:35,250
L...

134
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:37,958
-He hung up.
-He's a star after all.

135
00:10:39,917 --> 00:10:41,000
Pappi, let's go.

136
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:41,917
Let's go.

137
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,167
How many bookings have
you taken up this month?

138
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,458
It's wedding season.

139
00:10:45,542 --> 00:10:49,250
Let's make the most of it.
So, how much do you want to earn?

140
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:52,625
Take up important bookings only.

141
00:10:54,167 --> 00:10:55,833
The inter-college Bhangra competition
is in nine days.

142
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:59,458
I don't want to blow this chance
to go to London.

143
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:02,167
Since when are you nervous about Bhangra?

144
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,542
Unfortunately,
I can't dance alone and win.

145
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,420
I need to find the right female lead.

146
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:16,917
DJ Jaggi and Pappi welcome you all!

147
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:20,542
Congratulations to Pinky and Sonu
on their wedding.

148
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:28,875
Bhangra, gidda, salsa, rock-n-roll.

190

Simi! Simi, we're in trouble.

191
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:52,792
What happened? Vodka over?

192
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,583
No, we've come to the wrong wedding.

193
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,333
Binny's wedding function
is at the hall outside.

194
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:57,458
Let's go.

195
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,417
She's good, Pappi.

196
00:14:00,542 --> 00:14:02,542
Take over, I'll go talk to her.

197
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:03,583
What do I play after this?

198
00:14:03,917 --> 00:14:05,583
Play whatever you want.

199
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:09,833
She has set the floor on fire.
Now they will dance all night.

200
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:21,625
Oh, look at all this amazing food!

201
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:23,167
But it's so crowded.

202
00:14:23,167 --> 00:14:24,583
Let's split up.

203
00:14:24,667 --> 00:14:27,875
You get the food and I'll get the vodka.

204
00:14:32,417 --> 00:14:34,250
Hello there. Jaggi.

205
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:40,875
-Jaggi, are you in London?
-No. Amritsar.

206
00:14:41,792 --> 00:14:43,625
Then say Sat Sri Akaal.

207
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:47,250
-Okay, Sat Sri Akaal.
-Sat Sri Akaal.

208
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:48,833
I want to talk to you.

209
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:51,417
It will cost you.

210
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,333
What?

211
00:14:52,792 --> 00:14:53,708
Two vodkas, please.

212
00:14:58,542 --> 00:15:02,420
Yo, bartender, two large vodkas.
Guys, please let me go.

213
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,333
Forget the vodka.

214
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:12,875
Forget it! We're calling off the wedding!

215
00:15:14,167 --> 00:15:15,958
Is this how you treat
the groom's best friend?

216
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,292
All of us here are Billu's best friends.

217
00:15:21,542 --> 00:15:23,500
Which one are you?

218
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,830
I am...

219
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:30,625
The friend from Canada.

220
00:15:31,417 --> 00:15:32,625
Yeah, Canada.

221
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,375
Yes, yes, Billu had a friend in Canada.

222
00:15:35,792 --> 00:15:38,125
Give him his drink.
He has come from very far.

223
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,333
I did it.

224
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:43,667
We did it.

225
00:15:43,917 --> 00:15:45,875
You goofed up. It was a teamwork.

226
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:48,208
Okay, cheers to teamwork.

227
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,667
Don't get smart.
What did you want to talk about?

228
00:15:56,167 --> 00:15:58,500
You're a good Bhangra dancer.

229
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:02,000
Tell me something I don't know.

230
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:07,792
Well, you don't have a boyfriend.

231
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:11,417
-How do you know that?
-Figured it out seeing your expression.

232
00:16:12,792 --> 00:16:17,420
Kaptaan used to say, only a person
in love can dance Jhumar well.

233
00:16:21,292 --> 00:16:22,875
I think you should leave.

234
00:16:23,667 --> 00:16:24,958
Don't ruin my buzz.

235
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:29,208
Has anyone told you
that your woofers are terrible?

236
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:31,917
There's no one like Simi.

237
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:35,958
Kaptaan also used to say,

238
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:40,000
a good dancer must have an attitude,

239
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,583
not an ego.

240
00:16:48,167 --> 00:16:49,167

Oh! Go easy, man, you gotta dance later.

271
00:18:30,417 --> 00:18:31,333
Bro...

272
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:34,250
Sat Sri Akaal.

273
00:18:40,167 --> 00:18:42,958
By the way, you're good at Bhangra too.

274
00:18:43,667 --> 00:18:45,208
Tell me something I don't know.

275
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:47,958
What's this now?

276
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:49,583
Ego or attitude?

277
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,917
And yes, you don't
have a girlfriend either.

278
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:58,750
Figured from your expressions in Jhumar.

279
00:18:59,792 --> 00:19:02,292
Kaptaan says, only a person
in love can do the Jhumar well...

280
00:19:02,417 --> 00:19:05,125
Only a person in love
can do the Jhumar well.

281
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:07,583
Well done.

282
00:19:07,667 --> 00:19:09,792
Who is this wise man, Kaptaan?

283
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:11,000
Kaptaan!

284
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:45,792
Kaptaan!

285
00:19:47,792 --> 00:19:49,875
Oh no, Father is here.

286
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:52,708
You go to the field.
Deepa, hide the drum.

287
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:56,917
Let's start.

288
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,500
-Hundred and twenty.
-Twenty.

289
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:00,458
Father will kill me. Idiots!

290
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:02,792
Start from the same number.
Come on.

291
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:04,667
Forty one.

292
00:20:05,417 --> 00:20:06,875
Forty two.

293
00:20:07,417 --> 00:20:08,792
Forty three.

294
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,250
Forty four.

295
00:20:12,292 --> 00:20:15,292
It warms my heart to
see you working this hard.

296
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:19,708
When my son goes into battle,
the enemy will tremble in fear.

297
00:20:19,792 --> 00:20:22,958
Let him get recruited first, Uncle.

298
00:20:23,542 --> 00:20:24,417
Keep quiet.

299
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,420
He is Jarnail Singh's grandson
and Karnail Singh's son after all.

300
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,000
Not a silly dancer like you.

301
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:31,667
He's joining the army the day after.

302
00:20:32,667 --> 00:20:36,420
Wait and watch, my boy will
win a bravery medal some day.

303
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,208
Hurry up.

304
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:27,750
A... C...

305
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,830
A, B, C.

306
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,292
Thank you so much.

307
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:17,375
We have more alcohol.

308
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:18,917
Yay!

309
00:22:19,792 --> 00:22:20,917
Let's go.

310
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:24,292
Kaptaan, try some.

311
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,708
Come on.

312
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:28,667
Try it.

313
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,375
Go on. Good job.

314
00:22:38,167 --> 00:22:39,875
I am Jarnail Singh's grandson,

315
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:44,167
and Karnail Singh's son, Kaptaan Singh...

316
00:22:46,542 --> 00:22:48,750
going back home without getting recruited.

317
00:22:50,667 --> 00:22:52,542
How can I face my father?

318
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:56,958
You are Kaptaan?
The best Bhangra dancer in Malwa.

319
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:01,667
Everyone knows this, except my father.

320
00:23:04,125 --> 00:23:09,417
Do you know I get invited to dance at
weddings so that they become more joyous?

321
00:23:09,417 --> 00:23:11,167
It's a God given gift...

322
00:23:11,625 --> 00:23:15,420
But my father wants me to
pick up a gun instead of a drum.

323
00:23:15,958 --> 00:23:17,000
Don't worry.

324
00:23:17,417 --> 00:23:20,208
Why don't you show us some Bhangra steps?

325
00:23:20,292 --> 00:23:21,583
Forget it, brother.

326
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:23,458
Sing something at least.

327
00:23:25,167 --> 00:23:26,542
Kaptaan...

328
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:05,125
I'll go and check.

329
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,417
This is Bhangra, sir.

330
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:24,292
The pride of Punjab and Punjabis.

331
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:34,420
Yes, sir.

332
00:24:34,583 --> 00:24:38,833
When people perform Bhangra,
there is a different energy in the air.

333
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,917
Brings your blood to a boil.

334
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:45,917
Sir, a rejected cadet.

335
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:50,958
He can't even lift a gun.

336
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:09,830
Father!

337
00:25:14,292 --> 00:25:17,208
Father, your son got selected.

338
00:25:19,625 --> 00:25:20,750
Of course.

339
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,417
-When is the battle?
-In ten days.

340
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:27,000
Oh, come on.

341
00:25:27,875 --> 00:25:30,292
Don't worry, Mother.

342
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,625
Don't cry.
You've given birth to a brave son.

343
00:25:37,292 --> 00:25:41,375
I'll be back in a couple of days, Father.
I'm going to Shinde's wedding.

344
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:44,417
-Wait.
-Yes?

345
00:25:45,792 --> 00:25:47,333
Do 800 push-ups before you go.

346
00:25:48,833 --> 00:25:49,667

Enough, guys,

390
00:28:24,833 --> 00:28:27,125
we need to proceed
with the wedding rituals.

391
00:29:02,125 --> 00:29:06,333
You know, you'd be tired singing
but I still wouldn't stop dancing.

392
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:14,917
If you're so confident, then meet me
by the pond tomorrow morning.

393
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:20,208
Let's see who tires first, you or me.

394
00:29:21,833 --> 00:29:24,500
You are our guests
for the next two days anyway.

395
00:29:25,458 --> 00:29:27,500
And we have to look after you all!

396
00:29:35,792 --> 00:29:36,625
Challenge accepted.

397
00:29:56,375 --> 00:29:57,833
Is this how you treat guests?

398
00:29:58,833 --> 00:30:00,750
I haven't found a twig to brush.

399
00:30:01,208 --> 00:30:03,292
You need a neem twig for that, not banyan.

400
00:30:16,375 --> 00:30:17,458
Should we start?

401
00:30:20,167 --> 00:30:21,125
You're in a hurry.

402
00:30:22,583 --> 00:30:23,542
Let me brush first.

403
00:30:24,292 --> 00:30:25,833
I can't stay for long.

404
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:29,250
I have to cook for all of you
at the temple.

405
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:41,250
-Why are you covering your face?
-Why should I show you my face?

406
00:30:42,417 --> 00:30:43,292
I am not mad.

407
00:30:45,833 --> 00:30:47,583
I'm engaged to someone.

408
00:30:48,917 --> 00:30:52,167
If someone sees me with you,

409
00:30:52,625 --> 00:30:54,583
my family will kill me.

410
00:30:57,875 --> 00:30:58,708
Oh.

411
00:31:01,667 --> 00:31:03,542
I wouldn't want that.

412
00:31:08,167 --> 00:31:09,167

Wow!

445
00:33:17,667 --> 00:33:20,500
So, Kaptaan fell in love
with Nimmo at first sight?

446
00:33:20,583 --> 00:33:22,875
-Yes.
-And then he danced the Jhumar in love.

447
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I finally get it.

448
00:33:27,292 --> 00:33:28,875
But who is this Kaptaan?

449
00:33:29,333 --> 00:33:30,667
Kaptaan was my grandfather.

450
00:33:32,542 --> 00:33:34,417
Show some respect.

451
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:36,833
How can you call him like that?

452
00:33:36,917 --> 00:33:39,333
Kaptaan was my best friend and a legend.

453
00:33:39,708 --> 00:33:41,125
Not a fictional character...

454
00:33:41,292 --> 00:33:42,500
"Show respect."

455
00:33:43,167 --> 00:33:44,208
-Simi!
-What?

456
00:33:44,292 --> 00:33:47,167
Hope you remember we've come
for Binny's wedding. Come.

457
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:49,583
I haven't finished the story yet.

458
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,125
That guy is a rock star.

459
00:33:52,375 --> 00:33:53,792
Got his number?

460
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:55,625
Wait and watch, he'll ask for mine.

461
00:33:59,125 --> 00:34:00,458
Got her number?

462
00:34:01,542 --> 00:34:02,542
Pappi, chill.

463
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:05,833
-She's impressed. She'll ask.
-Awesome.

464
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:06,833
Here.

465
00:34:08,708 --> 00:34:09,542
One second.

466
00:34:11,625 --> 00:34:12,792
I saw the video, Jaggi.

467
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,000
She dances well.

468
00:34:14,667 --> 00:34:15,542
Get her on board.

469
00:34:15,708 --> 00:34:18,750
I'll speak with the Principal
and start preparing.

470
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:20,250
You're all set.

471
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:21,375
You too.

472
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,333
What?

473
00:34:22,417 --> 00:34:23,750
Pack the stuff and leave.

474
00:34:23,917 --> 00:34:25,333
Let me go and charm her.

475
00:34:25,417 --> 00:34:26,250
Madam, smile.

476
00:34:26,792 --> 00:34:28,750
Oh, finally you got time to be with me?

477
00:34:29,417 --> 00:34:30,833
You had promised me

478
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:35,500
that you'll be with me during
all the wedding rituals.

479
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,792
I met this really cool guy.

480
00:34:40,125 --> 00:34:41,583
From Billu's family?

481
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,333
Keep walking, ma'am.

482
00:34:43,958 --> 00:34:44,792
The DJ guy.

483
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:45,708
Golu?

484
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:46,625
Ma'am, look here.

485
00:34:48,625 --> 00:34:49,500
No.

486
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:52,167
The DJ at the wedding next door. DJ Jaggi.

487
00:34:52,708 --> 00:34:54,708
Madam was floored by his music.

488
00:34:55,917 --> 00:34:57,625
By his dance, actually.

489
00:34:58,458 --> 00:35:00,420
Please walk a little faster.

490
00:35:00,792 --> 00:35:01,750
Shut up.

491
00:35:16,458 --> 00:35:17,833
Sat Sri Akaal.

492
00:35:18,833 --> 00:35:21,167
Billu, don't you worry,
I'll take care of it.

493
00:35:34,375 --> 00:35:36,500
Look, let me clear this up.

494
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,500
Don't act too smart or you'll get slapped.

495
00:35:39,667 --> 00:35:40,500
Hello!

496
00:35:41,208 --> 00:35:42,375
I have some self-respect.

497
00:35:42,458 --> 00:35:45,292
Don't you use alcohol
as an excuse to get touchy with me.

498
00:35:47,292 --> 00:35:49,542
Chill, there's no danger to your honor.

499
00:35:54,958 --> 00:35:55,958
Tell me something...

500
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:59,667
When did you realize
that you're good at Bhangra?

501
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:03,167
I've been hearing Kaptaan's stories
since childhood.

502
00:36:03,708 --> 00:36:08,208
My father says, others have to learn,
but Bhangra is in our blood.

503
00:36:10,792 --> 00:36:13,250
Father teaches Bhangra at Pendu Club.
See this.

504
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,417
I've learnt Bhangra from him for years.

505
00:36:21,583 --> 00:36:23,833
One day, I had to leave it all
and come to Amritsar.

506
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,333
Why?

507
00:36:28,208 --> 00:36:29,167
I had bigger dreams.

508
00:36:30,583 --> 00:36:32,417
And may I ask what are they?

509
00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:36,667
Mom says, if you share your dreams
they won't come true.

510
00:36:40,667 --> 00:36:41,542
Your turn...

511
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:46,167
When did you realize
you're such a talented dancer?

512
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,125
I didn't, my mother did.

513
00:36:55,583 --> 00:36:57,417
She saw my love for it.

514
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:03,208
Whatever I couldn't say,
I expressed through my dance.

515
00:37:07,667 --> 00:37:10,167
And then I trained harder and harder

516
00:37:10,167 --> 00:37:12,417
and became the best Bhangra dancer.

517
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:15,292
Best "female" Bhangra dancer!

518
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:23,958
Okay, I have to go.

519
00:37:24,917 --> 00:37:26,208
Time to earn some money.

520
00:37:30,208 --> 00:37:32,292
Your number in exchange for the shoes.

521
00:37:33,667 --> 00:37:34,958
-Five...
-Eight, nine, zero.

522
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,250
Eight, nine, zero.

523
00:37:36,833 --> 00:37:37,750
Tell me your full name.

524
00:37:37,833 --> 00:37:39,208
I know a lot of Simis.

525
00:37:40,833 --> 00:37:41,917
Simi Geeta Kohli.

526
00:37:42,917 --> 00:37:43,750
Geeta?

527
00:37:44,208 --> 00:37:45,667
Don't you use father's name?

528
00:37:47,208 --> 00:37:49,830
Forget it. My history is very boring.

529
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:51,375
Tell me more about you.

530
00:38:17,708 --> 00:38:19,417
Friends, I have fallen in love.

531
00:38:21,708 --> 00:38:22,542
Really?

532
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:25,333
We should celebrate then.

533
00:38:25,583 --> 00:38:26,792
Get some more booze.

534
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,333
My friend is in love.

535
00:38:29,958 --> 00:38:31,167
Oh, come on.

536
00:38:31,917 --> 00:38:34,583
You better get married
before you leave for the war.

537
00:38:34,917 --> 00:38:36,167
My thoughts as well.

538
00:38:39,833 --> 00:38:41,917
But I'm not sure if her family will agree.

539
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,830
What are you saying, brother?

540
00:38:45,417 --> 00:38:50,000
If they don't,
we'll get her to elope with you.

541
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:52,958
It's my promise.

542
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:54,708
Try me.

543
00:38:54,875 --> 00:38:56,375
You guys are my true friends.

544
00:38:57,125 --> 00:38:59,250
So, what's her name?

545
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,417
Nimmo.

546
00:39:04,458 --> 00:39:05,333
Nimmo?

547
00:39:05,958 --> 00:39:07,420
Yes, that's her.

548
00:39:07,542 --> 00:39:09,375
The girl whose brothers are wrestlers?

549
00:39:10,125 --> 00:39:11,125
Yes, that's the one.

550
00:39:12,208 --> 00:39:14,500
Great. I'll take your leave.

551
00:39:15,417 --> 00:39:17,875
I have to tend to the fields
early in the morning.

552
00:39:18,542 --> 00:39:20,542
Kaptaan, I need to leave as well.

553
00:39:20,625 --> 00:39:21,625
Where are you going?

554
00:39:21,708 --> 00:39:23,125
Have to take a piss.

555
00:39:23,667 --> 00:39:26,875
-I drank too much.
-I need to go as well.

556
00:39:27,167 --> 00:39:29,830
What about your promise?

557
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:46,833
Let go.

558
00:39:53,583 --> 00:39:54,542
Sat Sri Akaal.

559
00:39:55,458 --> 00:39:56,583
Sat Sri Akaal.

560
00:39:59,542 --> 00:40:00,542
Sat Sri Akaal.

561
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:03,667
Sat Sri Akaal.

562
00:40:14,375 --> 00:40:15,500
Did I miss anyone?

563
00:40:16,917 --> 00:40:17,958
Sat Sri Akaal.

564
00:40:20,958 --> 00:40:21,958
What brings you here?

565
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,250
My name is Kaptaan Singh.
I live in the neighborhood.

566
00:40:25,333 --> 00:40:27,792
I didn't ask who you were.
Why are you here?

567
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:29,333
I am a soldier.

568
00:40:29,417 --> 00:40:31,750
I mean, what work do you have with us?

569
00:40:34,417 --> 00:40:35,708
Your sister, Nimmo...

570
00:40:46,917 --> 00:40:50,458
She sang so well
at our friend Shinde's wedding.

571
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:54,420
And you have come all the way here
to say this?

572
00:40:55,125 --> 00:40:57,458
No. Actually, what I want to say is...

573
00:40:58,167 --> 00:41:01,208
The words are stuck.
I can't seem to say them.

574
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:03,167
Shall I pull them out for you?

575
00:41:09,792 --> 00:41:13,167
Brother, I am in love with your
sister, Nimmo, and I want to marry her.

576
00:41:13,167 --> 00:41:14,125
You...

577
00:41:14,125 --> 00:41:14,958
No!

578
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:16,833
No one will lay a hand on him.

579
00:41:19,625 --> 00:41:25,375
You! Choose,
at whose hands you wish to die.

580
00:41:26,708 --> 00:41:27,917
Choose a weapon as well.

581
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:32,708
I don't want people to say
that we killed a lone, unarmed man.

582
00:41:45,542 --> 00:41:49,375
Look, I don't know how to fight.
I just know how to dance.

583
00:41:52,333 --> 00:41:54,458
So, I will show you what I know.

584
00:41:55,875 --> 00:41:58,000
Deepa, play the drum.

585
00:42:57,830 --> 00:43:01,667
All that exercise has made your
muscles bigger but your brains smaller.

586
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:03,917
You boys can't recognize a good man.

587
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:06,583
-What do you mean, Grandma?
-Come here, I'll tell you.

588
00:43:09,333 --> 00:43:14,333
I think this boy is perfect for Nimmo.

589
00:43:15,208 --> 00:43:18,583
No one will keep her as happy as he will.

590
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:24,292
His innocence reflects in his sincerity.

591
00:43:26,792 --> 00:43:28,792
What do you see in him, Grandma?

592
00:43:28,875 --> 00:43:31,625
I have seen what I had to.

593
00:43:32,830 --> 00:43:35,667
Poor Nimmo is yet to see
the man you've chosen for her.

594
00:43:36,667 --> 00:43:38,833
Listen to me, he's a good boy.

595
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,708
But he's a soldier
who will be leaving for war soon.

596
00:43:43,333 --> 00:43:45,750
How can we get Nimmo married to him?

597
00:43:49,917 --> 00:43:54,417
Son, we will wait till Diwali.

598
00:43:54,417 --> 00:43:59,830
If you're back by then,
you can marry Nimmo.

599
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:03,708
If not, Nimmo will get married
to the same guy she's engaged to.

600
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:06,750
Thank you, Grandma.

601
00:44:07,542 --> 00:44:08,375
Bless you.

602
00:44:15,830 --> 00:44:17,167
Come on, it's time. Let's go.

603
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:18,500
Sat Sri Akaal.

604
00:44:18,583 --> 00:44:19,833
Let's go. Time to go.

605
00:44:19,917 --> 00:44:21,420
Come on.

606
00:44:23,708 --> 00:44:25,708
-Take care of yourself.
-You too.

607
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:28,667
God bless you.

608
00:44:56,292 --> 00:44:57,458
Whenever you miss me,

609
00:44:59,708 --> 00:45:01,667
sing a song under the tree where we met.

610
00:45:04,333 --> 00:45:06,375
I'll dance on the battlefield for you.

I'll call you tomorrow, okay?

621
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:46,500
Simi, Uncle Timmy is leaving.
He can give us a ride.

622
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:47,333
Should we leave?

623
00:45:47,792 --> 00:45:49,583
I've eaten too much.

624
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:51,458
Let's go.

625
00:45:52,375 --> 00:45:54,125
But I'm hungry.

626
00:45:54,625 --> 00:45:55,833
You haven't eaten yet?

627
00:45:57,208 --> 00:45:58,708
Let me take you for a treat.

628
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:00,958
-Okay, let's go.
-Hey...

629
00:46:02,458 --> 00:46:04,958
-You're breaking the protocol.
-Sorry.

630
00:46:09,830 --> 00:46:11,125
Simi, are you sure
you want to go with him?

631
00:46:12,583 --> 00:46:14,125
Anything for the competition?

632
00:46:14,208 --> 00:46:16,750
Hush! I haven't told him yet.

633
00:46:17,417 --> 00:46:18,375
Keep your phone on.

634
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:20,125
I'll update you every 30 minutes.

635
00:46:20,125 --> 00:46:22,420
-Are you done talking?
-Yes, let's go.

636
00:46:53,292 --> 00:46:54,708
Simi, you're a great dancer.

637
00:46:55,292 --> 00:46:58,792
That step of yours was awesome.

638
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:00,125
Which one?

639
00:47:00,208 --> 00:47:02,917
The one in which you touch your hand
and... This one.

640
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:06,833
This one.

641
00:47:10,167 --> 00:47:12,583
It goes like this.

642
00:47:15,583 --> 00:47:17,500
-Should I give you a beat?
-Sure.

643
00:47:19,542 --> 00:47:20,542
How'd you do it?

644
00:47:23,625 --> 00:47:25,500
Yes, like that.

645
00:47:27,333 --> 00:47:28,167
Correct.

646
00:47:37,333 --> 00:47:38,542
Can I tell you something?

647
00:47:39,875 --> 00:47:40,750
Sure.

648
00:47:41,167 --> 00:47:46,250
I want us to team up for this year's
inter-college dance competition.

649
00:47:46,333 --> 00:47:47,417
Really?

650
00:47:48,625 --> 00:47:51,375
That's great!
I want us to be on the same team too.

651
00:47:51,458 --> 00:47:52,333
Is it?

652
00:47:54,333 --> 00:47:56,792
On that note, victory to...

653
00:47:56,875 --> 00:47:59,542
-Khalsa College!
-G.N.D.U. College!

654
00:48:01,792 --> 00:48:03,875
I think we drank too much.

655
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:05,250
I heard the name wrong.

656
00:48:05,333 --> 00:48:06,375
Me too.

657
00:48:07,708 --> 00:48:08,917
Let's say it again.

658
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,750
Victory to...

659
00:48:11,917 --> 00:48:13,708
-Khalsa College!
-G.N.D.U. College!

660
00:48:16,208 --> 00:48:18,417
-You're from G.N.D.U. College?
-You're from Khalsa?

661
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:20,750
Victory to Khalsa College!

662
00:48:20,833 --> 00:48:21,792
No way!

663
00:48:22,125 --> 00:48:23,250
You're our biggest rival.

664
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:26,417
And Mr. Jaggi,
don't you dare copy any of my steps.

665
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:27,417
Get lost!

666
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:28,958
Don't you copy my steps!

667
00:48:29,875 --> 00:48:30,708
Which one?

668
00:48:30,792 --> 00:48:32,708
-Which step have I copied?
-This one!

669
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,958
This calls for war.

670
00:48:37,667 --> 00:48:42,375
The step you just learnt,
better forget it right now.

671
00:48:42,458 --> 00:48:44,625
-Shall I give you a beat?
-Shall I beat you up?

672
00:48:54,167 --> 00:48:57,958
Simi, there's no point fighting.

673
00:49:00,792 --> 00:49:02,417
I've spoken to the coach.

674
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:05,583
You'll easily get admission.

675
00:49:06,792 --> 00:49:08,125
Join the winning team.

676
00:49:09,458 --> 00:49:13,708
You know, the winning team gets
a fully sponsored trip to London, right?

677
00:49:15,208 --> 00:49:16,500
And that'll be our team.

678
00:49:17,417 --> 00:49:19,583
Now, get lost.

679
00:49:20,833 --> 00:49:21,875
Let me warn you.

680
00:49:23,917 --> 00:49:29,708
No one can ruin my dream of winning.

681
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,625
Your mother is right, Jaggi.

682
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:37,708
You shouldn't share your dreams
or they won't come true.

683
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:53,208
Geets, I saw this boy
at the wedding yesterday.

684
00:49:53,458 --> 00:49:56,125
Going to weddings
to see boys now, are we?

685
00:49:58,125 --> 00:49:59,292
Let me finish at least.

686
00:49:59,958 --> 00:50:01,625
You know how good he was at Bhangra?

687
00:50:02,830 --> 00:50:02,917
Give it.

688
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:04,667
Was he better than you?

689
00:50:05,333 --> 00:50:06,708
No, no, he wasn't.

690
00:50:07,830 --> 00:50:08,625
No one can be better than you.

691
00:50:10,667 --> 00:50:12,333
No one should be better than you.

692
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,830
Do you remember, Simu?

693
00:50:15,333 --> 00:50:16,542
How would you?

694
00:50:16,625 --> 00:50:19,333
You were only nine
when your father left us.

695
00:50:19,792 --> 00:50:21,667
You have to get to London.

696
00:50:21,833 --> 00:50:24,917
Not illegally like him,
but with your head held high.

697
00:50:25,333 --> 00:50:28,792
He'll see that you've gone there,
not sneakily...

698
00:50:28,875 --> 00:50:30,420
But as a star.

699
00:50:36,208 --> 00:50:39,500
Geets, don't get so emotional.

700
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:45,375
Forget Punjab, your daughter
is the best Bhangra dancer in the world!

701
00:50:47,292 --> 00:50:48,292
Want some biscuits?

702
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,125
Acting all emotional and sweet, huh?

703
00:50:52,458 --> 00:50:55,750
No, let it be.
I have to get ready for college.

704
00:51:01,208 --> 00:51:04,833
Mom, don't you worry.
I'm going to win this year.

705
00:51:10,667 --> 00:51:11,667
Sat Sri Akaal.

706
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:13,125
Welcome to all.

707
00:51:13,125 --> 00:51:14,750
We are at LPU!

708
00:51:14,833 --> 00:51:18,500
Everyone is ready for
the inter-college competition.

709
00:51:18,583 --> 00:51:21,420
You can see the excitement in the air.

710
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,333
There are eight colleges
participating this year.

711
00:51:28,792 --> 00:51:31,792
And like every year,
there are two top favorites.

712
00:51:31,875 --> 00:51:35,167
Khalsa College
and G.N.D.U. College, Amritsar.

713
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:38,375
Both of them have strong teams.

714
00:51:38,458 --> 00:51:41,417
But the judges will decide the winner.

715
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:44,208
And the winning team
will be sent to London

716
00:51:44,208 --> 00:51:49,833
to participate in the
Bhangra Battle International Competition.

717
00:51:54,792 --> 00:51:55,625
Sorry, Sir.

718
00:51:55,708 --> 00:51:59,333
Our lives are in danger every time
we agree to judge this competition.

719
00:51:59,417 --> 00:52:03,708
Don't worry, we've informed
the police well in advance.

the two teams to reach the finals,
after the eliminations are...

737
00:54:00,208 --> 00:54:02,375
-Khalsa College...
-Yay!

738
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:05,458
-And G.N.D.U. College, Amritsar!
-Yay!

739

Cool! Cool! Cool!

740
00:54:07,917 --> 00:54:10,250
Anything can happen
in the finals tomorrow.

741
00:54:10,333 --> 00:54:13,250
These two teams will face each other
on the same stage.

742
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:15,667
This is the ultimate dance off.

743
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:17,750
Yay!

Victory to G.N.D.U. College!

746
00:54:41,830 --> 00:54:42,125
Hi!

747
00:54:42,125 --> 00:54:43,667
How are you, Mrs. Khurana?

748
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,542
Listen, at my wedding...

749
00:54:45,625 --> 00:54:48,250
did you have an affair
with the DJ or the video guy?

750
00:54:49,667 --> 00:54:50,708
What do you mean?

751
00:54:50,792 --> 00:54:52,000
Check your WhatsApp.

752
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,292
You couldn't sleep either?

753
00:55:17,875 --> 00:55:19,167
Worried? Because of me?

754
00:55:23,917 --> 00:55:26,167
I would be, if I didn't know the results.

755
00:55:26,958 --> 00:55:28,000
But I do.

756
00:55:28,830 --> 00:55:28,958
I know I'll win.

757
00:55:29,875 --> 00:55:32,167
And I know that I will beat you.

758
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:40,958
You're a sweet girl, Simi.
But you're in the wrong team.

759
00:55:42,250 --> 00:55:43,542
You're a cute guy too.

760
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,333
But you're my opponent.

761
00:55:47,292 --> 00:55:48,958
Why did you have to come
to the wrong wedding?

762
00:55:51,833 --> 00:55:55,000
Even so, why did you follow me?

763
00:55:55,830 --> 00:55:57,875
Even if I followed you,
why did you get egoistic?

764
00:55:58,625 --> 00:56:01,208
If a stranger was being egoistic,
you should've left.

765
00:56:02,125 --> 00:56:03,667
Why did you start dancing?

766
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:06,583
When I was leaving after the dance,
why did you follow me?

767
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:13,375
There's no end to this blame game, Jaggi.

768
00:56:20,792 --> 00:56:22,000
Okay, let's end it here.

769
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:26,542
Whoever wins tomorrow,
treats the other person with drinks.

770
00:56:28,333 --> 00:56:29,167
Okay, done.

771
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:32,500
At the same joint where we parted ways.

772
00:56:47,958 --> 00:56:51,208
By the way, does your lead dancer
know Kaptaan's story?

773
00:56:53,125 --> 00:56:56,875
It's not a story I share
with everybody, Simi.

774
00:56:59,333 --> 00:57:00,250
Why me, then?

775
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:03,500
Don't know. I just did.

776
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:15,417
So, are you in love
with this lead dancer of yours?

777
00:57:15,792 --> 00:57:16,625
Why?

778
00:57:17,917 --> 00:57:20,708
You need to be in love to
perform the Jhumar well, right?

779
00:57:23,792 --> 00:57:26,250
Then both teams are equal
when it comes to Jhumar.

Don't take the law into your hands.

823
01:01:44,667 --> 01:01:46,708
It was a close fight.

824
01:01:47,417 --> 01:01:50,000
A huge round of applause
for both the teams.

825
01:01:53,625 --> 01:01:58,417
And the winner of the
Inter-college Bhangra Competition is...

826
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:02,958
G.N.D.U. College!

827
01:02:18,417 --> 01:02:21,875
Cheaters! This is cheating.

828
01:02:28,375 --> 01:02:30,167
They must have bribed the judges!

829
01:02:30,167 --> 01:02:31,417
What nonsense!

830
01:02:31,417 --> 01:02:32,708
You guys are losers.

831
01:02:33,333 --> 01:02:34,750
What did you say?

832
01:05:16,792 --> 01:05:17,958
Our steps were fine.

833
01:05:18,708 --> 01:05:20,125
Our timing was also spot on.

834
01:05:21,625 --> 01:05:22,875
How the hell did we lose?

835
01:05:26,250 --> 01:05:29,833
They must've bribed the judges.

836
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,208
You guys just zip it.

837
01:05:32,958 --> 01:05:35,167
I'm in jail at this age
because of you fools!

838
01:05:41,420 --> 01:05:42,667
It was their lucky day.

839
01:05:47,458 --> 01:05:48,667
Tomorrow, it'll be ours.

840
01:05:58,958 --> 01:06:00,167
Enough, Geets.

841
01:06:00,250 --> 01:06:02,375
How many more?
You've covered all angles.

842
01:06:03,333 --> 01:06:04,208
Come on!

843
01:06:07,830 --> 01:06:07,917
This is for you.

844
01:06:13,667 --> 01:06:15,125
What is the need of this?

845
01:06:15,875 --> 01:06:17,208
Why are you wasting money?

846
01:06:17,333 --> 01:06:20,417
Come on, let's take a selfie.

847
01:06:21,375 --> 01:06:22,208
Quick!

848
01:06:22,458 --> 01:06:23,708
Hold it like this.

849
01:06:27,167 --> 01:06:28,917
One more. Show me.

850
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:35,417
I'll post all these photos on Facebook.

851
01:06:36,333 --> 01:06:37,375
Everyone will see.

852
01:06:38,420 --> 01:06:40,625
You've made all my dreams come true.

853
01:06:41,250 --> 01:06:42,875
She's going to England.

854
01:06:43,792 --> 01:06:47,792
-With her head held high--
-...to the Bhangra Competition.

855
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,375
You're mocking me again?

856
01:06:50,542 --> 01:06:51,500
Forget it.

857
01:06:52,792 --> 01:06:56,333
The one you're trying to prove
all this to, isn't a part of our lives.

858
01:06:57,542 --> 01:06:59,420
Let's not talk about him today.

859
01:06:59,958 --> 01:07:02,542
-Come, let's drink some wine.
-Oh, God! Alcohol?

860
01:07:03,208 --> 01:07:06,583
-Not at all. It's just some fruit juice.
-I don't want to.

861
01:07:06,917 --> 01:07:09,375
You go ahead and celebrate
with your friends.

862
01:07:09,958 --> 01:07:12,292
-Sure?
-Yes, go and party.

863
01:07:14,125 --> 01:07:15,420
Love you.

864
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,458
Kiran: You're coming, right?

865
01:07:21,167 --> 01:07:24,917
Simi: No, meeting Jaggi.

866
01:07:27,667 --> 01:07:30,667
We're letting you off with a warning.
Go home directly.

867
01:07:41,250 --> 01:07:44,208
Let's forget what happened, Coach.

868
01:07:44,958 --> 01:07:48,125
-We'll start afresh tomorrow.
-The competition is over, Jaggi.

869
01:07:48,542 --> 01:07:49,833
They are going to London.

870
01:07:50,208 --> 01:07:52,167
So can we, Lakha.

871
01:07:52,375 --> 01:07:55,583
Jaggi, the winning team
gets a sponsored trip to London.

872
01:07:56,292 --> 01:07:58,333
The losing team has to sponsor themselves.

873
01:07:58,417 --> 01:07:59,958
We'll raise the funds.

874
01:08:01,542 --> 01:08:03,208
Our team is better than theirs.

875
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:06,625
And I am the best.
We simply lost by a couple of points.

876
01:08:24,833 --> 01:08:25,667
Chotu!

877
01:08:31,333 --> 01:08:33,125
-Get some vodka.
-Something to eat?

878
01:08:34,420 --> 01:08:36,625
We'll drink first. We'll eat later.

879
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:44,792
Simi: I've ordered the drinks, hurry up.

880
01:08:46,958 --> 01:08:51,208
Simi: I've ordered the drinks, hurry up.
Before I finish the bottle myself.

881
01:08:53,625 --> 01:08:56,917
Jaggi, don't count me in your team.
I have to study for my exams.

882
01:08:58,250 --> 01:09:00,625
Even I have to apply for the sports quota.

883
01:09:01,125 --> 01:09:05,208
If I don't get a job after college,
my dad will kill me.

884
01:09:05,958 --> 01:09:07,583
You guys are such losers.

885
01:09:08,830 --> 01:09:10,250
-Coach--
-Who are you calling losers, Jaggi?

886
01:09:10,333 --> 01:09:13,333
If you cared about teamwork,
then you wouldn't be blaming us.

887
01:09:13,583 --> 01:09:15,875
Coach, we won't accept defeat.

888
01:09:15,958 --> 01:09:17,667
Leave them, let's form a new team.

889
01:09:19,420 --> 01:09:20,458
It wasn't the team's fault.

890
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:26,375
Anyway, it won't be easy
to come up with the money.

891
01:09:27,833 --> 01:09:30,375
Forget about London
and focus on your studies.

892
01:09:30,458 --> 01:09:31,417
Let's go.

893
01:09:39,292 --> 01:09:42,458
Jaggi, if you weren't so distracted
by Simi,

894
01:09:42,708 --> 01:09:44,417
we'd be packing for London now.

895
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:48,625
Preety, we would've definitely won
if your legs were faster than your tongue.

896
01:10:08,167 --> 01:10:09,500
She's calling you, Jaggi.

897
01:10:10,250 --> 01:10:11,833
She must be waiting for you.

898
01:10:14,208 --> 01:10:15,375
So, you won't go, huh?

899
01:10:15,458 --> 01:10:16,583
Why should I go there?

900
01:10:18,792 --> 01:10:19,833
Tell me. Why?

901
01:10:22,375 --> 01:10:25,333
To celebrate her success? Or my failure?

902
01:10:30,583 --> 01:10:33,625
Pappi, you know how important
this competition was for me.

903
01:10:38,625 --> 01:10:41,458
Father... Kaptaan...

904
01:10:41,542 --> 01:10:43,667
None of them have got their due.

905
01:10:46,667 --> 01:10:48,167
Nobody knows them.

906
01:10:56,333 --> 01:10:59,125
This competition was the
only way I could show the world

907
01:11:00,750 --> 01:11:02,167
what Bhangra means to us...

908
01:11:04,292 --> 01:11:05,708
and to Kaptaan.

909
01:11:13,167 --> 01:11:15,792
I've given my entire life for this.

910
01:11:18,750 --> 01:11:20,167
How could I just lose?

911
01:11:45,750 --> 01:11:47,292
Dude, let's go to a doctor.

912
01:11:47,958 --> 01:11:49,125
I'm fine.

913
01:11:49,833 --> 01:11:51,420
Why are you going back?

914
01:11:52,250 --> 01:11:53,708
How will you face them?

915
01:11:54,208 --> 01:11:56,375
It's wedding season and we'll be busy.

916
01:11:56,375 --> 01:11:58,000
You'll forget this loss.

917
01:12:01,420 --> 01:12:02,167
I don't want to forget it.

918
01:12:05,208 --> 01:12:06,167
Jaggi!

919
01:12:07,125 --> 01:12:08,000
Come out!

920
01:12:13,250 --> 01:12:14,830
Who are you?

921
01:12:15,833 --> 01:12:17,750
-What's going on?
-I'll handle it, sir.

922
01:12:21,792 --> 01:12:22,792
Come down.

923
01:12:25,375 --> 01:12:26,792
What's wrong with you, Simi?

924
01:12:31,708 --> 01:12:33,125
You couldn't accept the fact

925
01:12:33,917 --> 01:12:35,417
that I defeated you.

926
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:38,667
I waited for you endlessly.

927
01:12:40,833 --> 01:12:43,208
You didn't even have the guts
to take my calls.

928
01:12:48,833 --> 01:12:51,458
Never mind.

929
01:12:53,125 --> 01:12:54,750
Today, let me make you an offer.

930
01:12:57,125 --> 01:12:58,333
Join the winning team

931
01:13:00,292 --> 01:13:01,750
and I'll take you to London.

932
01:13:03,417 --> 01:13:05,833
Today was your day, Simi.
And you won.

933
01:13:09,250 --> 01:13:11,420
But next time, I'll win.

934
01:13:11,583 --> 01:13:12,917
Wait and watch.

935
01:13:13,292 --> 01:13:16,417
I'll get to London and defeat you
in front of the entire world.

936
01:13:20,333 --> 01:13:22,583
You're such a loser, Jaggi.

937
01:13:23,458 --> 01:13:26,167
The only way guys like you can reach UK

938
01:13:26,167 --> 01:13:28,420
is by being illegal immigrants.

939
01:13:31,167 --> 01:13:33,333
Not a star like Simi.

940
01:13:35,542 --> 01:13:36,958
Remember this day.

941
01:13:37,583 --> 01:13:41,500
Not just this once,
I'll defeat you every single time!

942
01:13:51,208 --> 01:13:52,420
Sir!

943
01:13:52,750 --> 01:13:53,958
Kaptaan has a request.

944
01:13:55,417 --> 01:13:58,333
He wants us to send a letter
and inform his family

945
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:00,708
that he died in the war.

946
01:14:01,625 --> 01:14:08,125
He'd rather die here than
return to Nimmo in this state.

Here.

978
01:18:08,125 --> 01:18:10,167
What's wrong? Given up drinking?

979
01:18:12,125 --> 01:18:13,000
Not in the mood.

980
01:18:16,250 --> 01:18:17,125
Did you lose?

981
01:18:23,167 --> 01:18:26,792
So, there is someone who can defeat you.

982
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:37,833
Son...

983
01:18:39,208 --> 01:18:40,750
You may not remember.

984
01:18:42,500 --> 01:18:47,625
As a child you'd leave for school

985
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:53,125
but end up at the Pendu Club every day.

986
01:18:56,500 --> 01:19:00,917
Sometimes I felt that Kaptaan
made this club more for you than me.

987
01:19:08,750 --> 01:19:14,833
But as your interest in Bhangra grew,
you grew further away from me.

988
01:19:14,917 --> 01:19:16,375
What was so wrong in that?

989
01:19:19,375 --> 01:19:20,958
For how long would we keep
dancing in this village?

990
01:19:24,375 --> 01:19:29,500
I wanted to show everyone
what Bhangra meant to Kaptaan,

991
01:19:30,420 --> 01:19:32,292
to you, to me, to us.

992
01:19:39,458 --> 01:19:42,917
Everything was on track but that girl
Simi came and ruined everything.

993
01:19:45,875 --> 01:19:47,125
She probably knows that

994
01:19:49,417 --> 01:19:51,917
you don't forget your loved ones
to follow your dreams.

995
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,333
Dad, I'm not here
to listen to your lectures.

996
01:19:54,417 --> 01:19:55,542
What is it then?

997
01:19:57,208 --> 01:19:58,830
What do you want?

998
01:20:01,875 --> 01:20:02,750
Tell me.

999
01:20:06,417 --> 01:20:07,333
Fine.

1000
01:20:10,542 --> 01:20:13,708
Actually, I don't have a team.

1001
01:20:15,833 --> 01:20:16,708
And I alone...

1002
01:20:19,208 --> 01:20:22,167
Do those guys still
come to train at Pendu Club?

1003
01:20:33,958 --> 01:20:35,875
Finally you've come to the point.

1004
01:20:38,875 --> 01:20:42,708
Son, they have always been here.

1005
01:20:44,750 --> 01:20:46,208
You're the one who left us.

1006
01:20:48,958 --> 01:20:51,583
And now you're back because you need them.

1007
01:20:52,420 --> 01:20:54,830
-That's not true.
-Then what is?

1008
01:20:55,750 --> 01:20:57,583
I was missing Mom as well.

1009
01:20:59,458 --> 01:21:00,542
Is she looking at us?

1010
01:21:02,458 --> 01:21:03,333
Raise your glass.

1011
01:21:05,250 --> 01:21:06,208
Cheers!

1012
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:26,667
Wow! You guys have improved so much!

1013
01:22:27,125 --> 01:22:28,792
With my city training

1014
01:22:28,875 --> 01:22:31,625
and your desi moves, we'll rock London.

1015
01:22:32,292 --> 01:22:35,458
We'll practice hard,
raise the money and win the competition.

1016
01:22:36,125 --> 01:22:39,125
Coach, we've heard that he lost.

1017
01:22:39,875 --> 01:22:41,583
And why should we dance with him?

1018
01:22:42,292 --> 01:22:45,333
He's the one who left us.

1019
01:22:46,625 --> 01:22:50,500
What if he leaves us again
for another city team?

1020
01:22:50,583 --> 01:22:53,458
-Come on, Harpal.
-We don't need him.

1021
01:22:56,167 --> 01:22:58,917
We'll reach wherever we have to,
by ourselves.

1022
01:22:59,333 --> 01:23:00,167
Let's go.

1023
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,000
You guys are right.

1024
01:23:04,417 --> 01:23:06,000
You don't need me.

1025
01:23:08,250 --> 01:23:10,750
But I'm the one who needs you.

1026
01:23:13,125 --> 01:23:14,875
Please just trust me this time.

1027
01:23:20,875 --> 01:23:23,830
-Let's go.
-Sorry, Coach.

1028
01:23:30,792 --> 01:23:31,750
What happened, son?

1029
01:23:36,250 --> 01:23:40,375
You don't just get someone's trust.
You have to earn it.

1030
01:23:41,917 --> 01:23:45,333
And you won't just get a team.
You have to make it.

1031
01:24:09,917 --> 01:24:10,833
Wait a minute!

1032
01:24:15,708 --> 01:24:16,542
Where's Lucky?

1033
01:24:31,375 --> 01:24:32,375
Lucky!

1034
01:24:40,167 --> 01:24:42,000
Lucky, we need to talk.

1035
01:24:43,830 --> 01:24:44,250
Call me Sir.

1036
01:24:45,420 --> 01:24:46,125
Everyone calls me Sir.

1037
01:24:46,958 --> 01:24:49,958
I've won the district level
inter-school competition. Sit.

1038
01:24:52,958 --> 01:24:54,000
Leave, guys.

1039
01:24:54,375 --> 01:24:56,333
Go. Play.

1040
01:25:01,167 --> 01:25:03,667
Sir, will you help me build a team?

1041
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:10,625
Look, there are quite a few issues
with you. No team, no money.

1042
01:25:10,625 --> 01:25:12,750
And you're a traitor above all.

1043
01:25:13,375 --> 01:25:14,583
How will you solve this?

1044
01:25:18,667 --> 01:25:21,125
I'll try my best to be a changed man.

1045
01:25:22,167 --> 01:25:23,375
You just...

1046
01:25:24,542 --> 01:25:25,417
I mean...

1047
01:25:26,208 --> 01:25:29,000
Sir, please help me
get the others on board.

1048
01:25:30,417 --> 01:25:33,167
Fine. I'm sure I can make that happen.

1049
01:25:33,625 --> 01:25:35,792
But what's in it for me?

1050
01:25:55,792 --> 01:25:59,833
We've progressed a lot in
the last two years. Harpal, for instance.

1051
01:26:01,208 --> 01:26:05,750
He might be a farmer
but has the attitude of a billionaire.

1052
01:26:05,750 --> 01:26:08,167
Looks after his fields all by himself.

1053
01:26:09,375 --> 01:26:12,420
There's only one way to win him over.
Come with me.

1054
01:26:45,708 --> 01:26:46,708
Now, Amrinder.

1055
01:26:47,250 --> 01:26:50,333
She's as good a designer
as she is a dancer.

1056
01:26:51,167 --> 01:26:53,458
She will make fantastic costumes for us.

1057
01:27:26,208 --> 01:27:27,417
Yes!

1058
01:27:27,417 --> 01:27:29,542
And lastly, we have Heer.

1059
01:27:29,625 --> 01:27:32,830
She's studying for IELTS
for the past three years.

1060
01:27:33,708 --> 01:27:36,208
She has only one desire. Going abroad.

1061
01:27:52,417 --> 01:27:53,458
Shut up.

1062
01:27:55,958 --> 01:27:58,830
I'll shut up if you join the team.

1063
01:28:07,708 --> 01:28:11,833
Think about it. You can impress
all those foreign guys with your English.

1064
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:13,583
I have one condition.

1065
01:28:15,167 --> 01:28:18,125
What if you've forgotten desi Bhangra
after living in the city?

1066
01:28:18,958 --> 01:28:23,417
Let's see if you are
good enough for our team or not.

No. Sounds like a wannabe club.

1084

Jaggi has joined them.

1126
01:33:20,292 --> 01:33:21,500
Okay. Okay.

1127
01:33:21,750 --> 01:33:23,875
Son, I think it has blown a fuse.

1128
01:33:23,958 --> 01:33:25,500
-Check.
-Try some of this. Sure.

1129
01:33:25,583 --> 01:33:28,250
Dad, it uses Wi-Fi, it's wireless.
There's no fuse.

1130
01:33:28,250 --> 01:33:31,625
-Make some place for the expert.
-Come here.

1131
01:33:33,958 --> 01:33:37,125
As you know, this year's Bhangra Battle

1132
01:33:37,208 --> 01:33:41,458
is the biggest international
dance competition.

1133
01:33:42,292 --> 01:33:46,208
We've invited the most talented
and promising teams from around the world.

1134
01:33:46,792 --> 01:33:49,125
These teams have been selected
from four zones.

1135
01:33:53,375 --> 01:33:57,458
Like every year, we have a few teams
who didn't get sponsored.

1136
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:03,208
But based on their talent they will be
selected for the last two remaining spots.

1137
01:34:03,417 --> 01:34:05,708
And will get a chance to compete.

1138
01:34:38,167 --> 01:34:39,750
They have no chance of winning.

1139
01:35:24,625 --> 01:35:27,333
I'll get you some fruit juice.

1140
01:35:37,708 --> 01:35:40,208
Jaggi, I've packed some sweets.

1141
01:35:40,667 --> 01:35:41,583
All set?

1142
01:35:41,667 --> 01:35:43,417
Don't eat it up all alone.

1143
01:35:47,750 --> 01:35:48,958
So, Mr. Kesar Singh...

1144
01:35:49,375 --> 01:35:52,375
Aren't you upset
that I'm leaving the village again?

1145
01:35:52,792 --> 01:35:55,625
Not this time.
You're no longer the same Jaggi.

1146
01:35:58,375 --> 01:36:00,250
Is this the coach or my dad speaking?

1147
01:36:12,542 --> 01:36:14,750
We did it! London!

1148
01:36:49,708 --> 01:36:52,958
You can go back home.
He has written an application for you.

1149
01:36:53,708 --> 01:36:54,917
I don't want to go back.

1150
01:36:55,333 --> 01:36:57,708
Your family must be
waiting for you, Kaptaan.

1151
01:36:57,792 --> 01:36:59,625
I told you, I don't want to return!

1152
01:37:07,417 --> 01:37:12,458
Everybody is expecting the old Kaptaan.

1153
01:37:15,583 --> 01:37:17,417
The Kaptaan who sings, dances...

1154
01:37:20,458 --> 01:37:22,708
and brings joy to all with his Bhangra.

1155
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:32,375
Not this Kaptaan...

1156
01:37:36,417 --> 01:37:38,917
who can't even walk without help.

1157
01:37:40,125 --> 01:37:41,417
I won't go back home.

1158
01:37:42,830 --> 01:37:44,583
I won't. I will die here.

1159
01:37:47,830 --> 01:37:48,792
I can't go back.

1160
01:37:57,750 --> 01:37:58,875
I can't.

1161
01:40:05,208 --> 01:40:06,417
Jaggi, look! Chocolates!

1162
01:40:28,125 --> 01:40:29,420
How are you, Simi?

1163
01:40:31,833 --> 01:40:34,420
I told you I'd get here.

1164
01:40:37,458 --> 01:40:38,292
Pendu Club?

1165
01:40:39,875 --> 01:40:41,125
Sounds very desi.

1166
01:40:41,667 --> 01:40:44,917
Bhangra is a desi dance form.
It was spread across cities later.

1167
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:48,542
You seem to know a lot.

1168
01:40:52,420 --> 01:40:55,542
You might've reached here,
but I won't let you win.

1169
01:40:57,667 --> 01:40:59,750
Make sure you take a few selfies in London

1170
01:41:00,125 --> 01:41:03,333
to post on your Instagram
when you lose and return.

1171
01:41:05,500 --> 01:41:09,250
The more you provoke me,
the better I'll perform.

1172
01:41:18,583 --> 01:41:20,500
How did they afford to come to London?

1173
01:41:22,583 --> 01:41:24,958
Bunch of villagers.

1174
01:41:28,417 --> 01:41:32,292
Bhangra originated in the villages, Veer.
It came to the cities much later.

Tara.

1228

I want to grow up to be just like you.
I like to dance as well.

1229

qualified for the finals.

-Please.

01:46:57,292 --> 01:46:59,542
I was around Tara's age
when you left, right?

1236
01:47:04,458 --> 01:47:06,250
Try not to leave this family of yours.

1237
01:47:09,500 --> 01:47:11,000
My mother is a strong woman.

1238
01:47:12,542 --> 01:47:15,750

to our lives.

01:47:47,583 --> 01:47:48,875
Nothing. I just love you.

1243
01:47:50,458 --> 01:47:52,292
I'm hanging up now. Bye.

1244
01:48:04,250 --> 01:48:06,208
Your history isn't so boring after all.

1245
01:48:10,667 --> 01:48:11,500
Vodka?

1246
01:48:18,292 --> 01:48:19,125
Let's go!

1247
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:33,958
How long has it been?

1248
01:48:38,500 --> 01:48:39,333
Since childhood.

1249
01:48:43,958 --> 01:48:47,420
-How did you form the team?
-Hard work.

1250
01:48:54,833 --> 01:48:56,208
Why didn't you confront him?

1251
01:49:00,708 --> 01:49:03,458
I thought the day I'd see him
I'd say a lot.

1252
01:49:06,830 --> 01:49:09,208
But I didn't have the heart to,
when I saw Tara.

1253
01:49:14,917 --> 01:49:18,375
Why fight with someone you don't want to
keep a relationship with?

1254
01:49:27,625 --> 01:49:31,125
What did the doctor say?
Can you dance tomorrow?

1255
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:35,958
Or am I winning again?

1256
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:41,583
If you're pulling my leg,
pull the right one, left one still hurts.

1257
01:49:49,542 --> 01:49:51,420
But you're really lucky, Simi.

1258
01:49:52,833 --> 01:49:54,750
You had all the chances of losing.

1259
01:49:56,750 --> 01:49:58,542
Kaptaan's grandson is saying this?

1260
01:50:08,958 --> 01:50:10,792
What would he have done in your place?

1261
01:51:05,420 --> 01:51:06,542
I've won the medal, Father.

1262
01:51:08,708 --> 01:51:10,292
But I lost the love of my life.

1263
01:52:02,542 --> 01:52:04,250
Kaptaan, you are back?

1264
01:52:04,958 --> 01:52:06,208
We thought you were dead.

1265
01:52:07,792 --> 01:52:13,333
Looks as good as dead to me.
Why are you here? Look around.

1266
01:52:13,917 --> 01:52:15,750
Nimmo is getting married today.

1267
01:52:16,250 --> 01:52:19,830
I've come to ask for Nimmo's hand
in marriage to Kaptaan.

1268
01:52:20,750 --> 01:52:22,333
He will keep her very happy.

1269
01:52:22,917 --> 01:52:26,417
How dare they come for Nimmo
on her wedding day!

1270
01:52:28,875 --> 01:52:33,420
You've come here but what can you do now?

1271
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:35,417
You cannot fight.

1272
01:52:36,167 --> 01:52:39,958
And now you can't even say
that you can dance.

1273
01:52:42,583 --> 01:52:43,667
Leave.

in the way he danced.

1297

I have decided
that Nimmo can't marry anyone else.

1298

Kaptaan narrated these stories
to make you fall in love with Bhangra?

1308
01:56:04,625 --> 01:56:09,000
He told his grandson
the story of his life.

1309
01:56:12,420 --> 01:56:13,958
You heard his story.

1310
01:56:16,208 --> 01:56:17,792
But you didn't learn anything.

1311
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,420
Bhangra was his passion.
