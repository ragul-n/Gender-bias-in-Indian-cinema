1
00:00:22,088 --> 00:00:25,088
They say friendship is greater than
all other relationships

2
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:29,259
But, friendship between us has been
over shadowed by a strange bond

3
00:00:32,932 --> 00:00:35,932
We first met at...

4
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:39,770
…In this college only!

5
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,380
His name is...

6
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:51,381
…Class topper!

7
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,120
Girls swoon over him

8
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:58,121
They always hang around him only

9
00:00:58,124 --> 00:01:01,124
He guides many students to
score centum in exams

10
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:06,830
ln college's good students list
...he's a Hero

11
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,970
My name is...

12
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:20,143
Are you Rajesh? l don't like
this proxy attendance

13
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:24,981
Students must be like fire
in studies

14
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:40,330
What did you say? Did he ask
about my absence from class?

15
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:43,168
Does he know what a spear gear means?

16
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:44,169
...Do you know?

17
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,672
Did he actually complete
his studies?

18
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:48,674
Ask him to come to me & learn!

19
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:50,175
...You'll teach, buddy!

20
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:52,578
Buddy! we must enjoy college life!

21
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:55,013
Anyway our life will be like
cat on a hot tin roof

22
00:01:55,014 --> 00:01:57,015
We can become serious then!

23
00:01:57,016 --> 00:02:00,016
l'm a Mechanical Engineering student

24
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:05,021
Hey! What's it man?
–l'm a small time rowdy in college

25
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:06,358
What do you say now?

26
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:09,359
Nothing brother! College is
very congested

27
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,930
What do l suggest for that is...

28
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:14,931
You're a rowdy outside the campus
l'm rowdy inside the campus

29
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:18,036
ls it so?

30
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:19,204
Oh! will you beat me?

31
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:21,874
Me? Beating you?
–No… No! it won't look good

32
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:22,875
Come on hit me?
–No brother!

33
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:25,210
Come on, hit me!

34
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:26,879
This is for you!

35
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,047
Brother....brother! – l'm not a rowdy
–Brother, don't run away

36
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:30,883
...l'm not a rowdy! l came just
to watch fun!

37
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:33,884
How's that?

38
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:37,387
...l warned you! but you turned deaf

39
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:40,893
Buddy! please give me concession

40
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:43,894
Even, l guided students to
score centum

41
00:02:44,063 --> 00:02:47,063
...But, they've to pay me
Rs 100, that's all

42
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:50,567
Girls are allergic to me

43
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:53,739
No question paper for you!
study and pass...go away

44
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,740
Why?

45
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:56,575
Because you're a girl

46
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:59,576
Adjust a little please!

47
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,680
l'm also a Hero!

48
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:08,251
Right from first meeting we had
an unimaginable mutual love

49
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:12,923
Hey! Buddy! trapped a bird!

50
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:17,763
No Rajesh! don't get involved
into unnecessary matters!

51
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:20,098
l'm warning you only, Rajesh
Please no...No!

52
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:22,434
Hey! l'm warning you
Please listen to me

53
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:25,435
Come on guys clap!
everyone, please clap! clap!

54
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:29,775
He called us as idiots and
beat me up

55
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:31,443
lf he's a Mechanical Engineer does
he think himself to be great?

56
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:34,444
Today, he's finished!

57
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:41,453
Why did you interfere into
my friend's matter?

58
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:44,454
Why did you beat him?
–Shall l give you also few punches?

59
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:03,139
Leave me...Leave me!

60
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:06,476
Are you here to study or fight?

61
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:08,981
You may have trouble between
yourselves! keep it off the campus!

62
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:11,149
...Not inside the college

63
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:13,485
Shyam! you're a brilliant student

64
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:15,654
Why do want all this gangs
& brawls?

65
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:18,323
Look at him, with ear studs
a chain around neck

66
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:19,658
...A steel bangle on hand

67
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:22,659
Rajesh! you're very proud on receiving
money whenever you ask from grandpa

68
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:26,496
lf you concentrate little on studies
you'll be University topper

69
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:30,333
Leaving it...with 10 people behind you
and 10 people behind you

70
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:33,005
Combined together you're creating
chaos in the college

71
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:36,006
Sir, he had only started it

72
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:39,511
lf l get one more complaint
against you both

73
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:42,512
l'll expel you from the college

74
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:50,022
What?

75
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:51,189
What?

76
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:54,190
l'm not one to get scared
by Principal's warnings

77
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:57,362
You don't know about me

78
00:04:57,363 --> 00:04:59,197
Don't play all this foolish
kiddish behaviour with me

79
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:02,198
lf l decide l can go
to the top also

80
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:03,702
Oh! Mamma! l'm scared at that thought

81
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:06,703
l don't know why! basically
l'm a good man only

82
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:09,706
When l see you and your filthy gang
l lose my head

83
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:13,378
...Turn into a bad man immediately
why do you think, l'm like that?

84
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:16,379
What you're becoming now?
you're a born bad man

85
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,720
Hey! you're abusing in English
scold in Telugu please...he hates me!

86
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:29,192
...l hate him to the core

87
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:58,254
Am l not telling you?

88
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:19,444
Buddy! bouquet boy!

89
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:22,445
He's a man with great luck!
one should be born like him only

90
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:24,449
Does he have a lucky mole?

91
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:27,450
Whatever you may say, he's a
great hit with girls

92
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:29,121
What happened after that?

93
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:32,122
What'll happen? l jumped in
and saved him

94
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:38,461
My friends have got bored
talking with boys

95
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:41,464
They feel like talking to girls

96
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:44,970
Can you give company to them?

97
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:47,971
...Don't do it freely!
l'll pay you Rs 500 each

98
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:50,976
Who's he? Elder brother?!

99
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:53,311
ls he Uncle or fiancee to
all of you?

100
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:55,981
Have you trapped all of you
in one go?

101
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:58,650
No, Sam!

102
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:01,651
Did you see? Sister stopped him and
brother stopped at once

103
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:04,988
You're a personification
of gentlemanliness

104
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:08,658
What's lacking in you? A flute?
l'll buy one for you

105
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:11,995
Hey! get a flute for elder brother

00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:33,349
8! 
–Only 8 isn't it?

109
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:38,523
Hey! what's this man? he's consoling
me and going away

110
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:40,192
May be he's thinking himself to
be great Einstein!

111
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:43,193
Hey! Rajesh! do you've 8 papers

112
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:49,199
Don't worry! l'll guide you

113
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:52,537
A small hitch! lt's little difficult
to enter your brain

114
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:55,373
Even then, l'll take tuitions, you've to
come early morning to my house

115
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:57,709
Knock at the door...

116
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,544
lf an opportunity arises, you've

...l've body pains also

118
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,882
Moreover, Principal has told
about you

119
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:05,550
Just now, l've come back after
discussing with him

120
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:08,551
Question paper sales! bad name to our
college in inter college competition

121
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:13,058
...He told me about everything!

122
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:14,893
lt isn't just enough to grow
length & breadth

123
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:16,728
One must've brain!

124
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:19,729
Oh! Did l say all this

Why're you scared to death?

129
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:46,089
Turn that side and close your eyes!

130
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:50,093
lf Principal calls and asks, you know
whose name you've to say isn't it?

131
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:55,267
Okay! Take it!

132
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:58,268
lt isn't important to keep here
you must act properly infront of Principal

133
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:13,783
At midnight going to warden's house and
writing filthy graffiti on walls

134
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:18,121
Bursting crackers inside his house

135
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,457
...What a nasty thing you've done?

136

Your name came up in the enquiry

140
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:45,148
You both joined together and

141
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:48,985

for a month

142
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:55,491
Stop!

00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:09,505
Hey! stop!

145
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:19,351
Why're you beating him, boy?

146

lt's unnecessary for you
you're not connected with this

147

Not connected? l'm the one who
made him to say your name

148
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:28,026
What's it boy? Why're you

00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:08,853
But the way, today's our last
day in college

176
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:11,854
Shall we've one last tango?
and decide the winner!

177
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:15,024
No please! save yourself!

178
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:18,029

to America

179
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,030
...You've got the right job!

180
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:22,031
That's sweeping & cleaning

181
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:24,369

And you're going to do that
same in lndia

184
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:35,713
A small wish!

185
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:38,714
We must never come face to face
again in life

186
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:37,373
We departed saying never to meet
again in life...2 years later

187
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:40,445
But!....

188
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:42,947

when l was a student

189
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:45,948
Such a man's teaching
it means...

190
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:52,622
Hey! don't use mobile in class room

191
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:08,139
Your Singapore project has

00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,308
$ 10,000 is the starting salary!

193

195
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:18,481
Grandpa is here only! l can't
leave him & go away

196
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:25,490

197
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:28,491
You're into computer

198
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:31,494
Not yet closed? ls it any tea shop
or petty shop to close

199
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,834
Such a large Library!...

200
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:39,835
Such a large clientele!
...Hundreds of E-mails…

201
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:43,506
Without replying the E-mails, do you
want me to gossip with you?

202
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:47,512
Night out as usual

203
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:50,513
My grandson is inside

204
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:51,683
Won't you come?

205
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:54,684
lf l come, it'll break into dawn

206
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:01,524
Sekhar, sing a song

207
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:06,862
Oh! My heart! Sweet Aunty
you're a mount of flesh

lf you come...l'll give..

209
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:13,705
Why did you burn me?

210
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:15,540
Why're you shouting?
–You burnt me, so l shouted?

211
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:16,541
...Before that..

212
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:19,542
l sang a Telugu translation of
channel'V'song. Am l wrong?

213
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:21,379
The song sung by him and the mood in which
we're, is there any connection

214
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,548
He's talking as if his a
Musical Genius

215
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:24,549
What do you know about music?

216
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,384
l may not know about music
but l do know about you

217
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:27,552
What do you know?

218
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:29,220
Don't pull words out of my mouth
l'll reveal your secrets

219
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:31,222
His mouth is Garbage bin
we mustn't open it!

220
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:32,724
Come on, tell!

221
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:35,725
What did you study?

222
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:38,396
Even that is a college!

223
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:39,731
But, you failed even there
also, isn't it?

224
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:42,732
Failing S.S.L.C you claimed to be an
Msc and trapped a Maths Teacher

225
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:45,069
...Aren't you ashamed of it?

226
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:48,070
She's a Maths Teacher, so l added
& subtracted, is it a great matter!

227
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:50,074
Looks like lot of things will
come out, if we dig up past

228
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:50,908
A lot will come out

229
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:53,745
He's gathering information as if he's
a Judge, out to pass judgement

230
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:55,913
....He himself looks like a
criminal on parole

231
00:16:55,914 --> 00:16:58,914
His photo is prominently pasted
in Police Stations

232
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:02,585
Look at his shoes! one is 8
and other is 9 size!

233
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:05,588
Steal! but, by checking the size

234
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:08,591
He'll go to any marriage, enjoys the feast
...he'll come back stealing shoes

235
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:11,095
Why're you beaming a smile?

236
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:12,263
ls it any T.V. show?

237
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:15,264
Don't talk about T.V. shows
talk about him only!

238
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:17,602
...You talk about him
–l'll talk about him!

239
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:20,603
ln a State, where even small children
to work in quaries!

240
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:25,608
Till now, did you ever do
any small work?

241
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:27,612
Even since your birth, you're
living comfortably

242
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:29,947
Did you work hard atleast for a
day and earned a rupee?

243
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:31,449
What can l do? l've a father

244
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,785
As if he only has father and
we all are Test tube babies

245
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:36,786
No, we're Wall Tube babies!

246
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:43,292
Shut up! don't go overboard

247
00:17:43,962 --> 00:17:45,630
Keep some English to yourself!

248
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:47,632
He's becoming too smart
–Hey! get me a paper – Take it!

249
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:48,299
Why?..why..why?

250
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,300
He's behaving as if he has come
down from Hollywood!

251
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:54,303
Let me test his standard of English

252
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:56,641
Why're you asking me all
of a sudden?

253
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:59,642
Do we've to take an appointment
from him for Fax or Courier also?

254
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:01,979
What shall we do with him?
–Come on, sign it!

255
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,648
We're talking, isn't it?

256
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:05,650
Why all this signatures?
–Now, he has come to our way

257
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:06,818
His standard is that much only!

258
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:09,819
...This is a case of Learning English
from Rapidex

259
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:12,990
...What were you doing 2 years earlier?
–l was smoking the same brand

260
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:15,991
You were stealing 2 rupees from a blind
beggar infront of Lord Rama's Temple!

261
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,665
Do you think, l had missed
seeing it?

262
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,667
Why're you remembering my
past story?

263
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:23,668
Shut up! otherwise, l'll open up
you secret!

264
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:24,836
What? What's it?

265
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:26,671
There's a Lord Shiva's Temple
outside the town, isn't it?

266
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:29,173
A beggar there will be sitting
like this....

267
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:30,675
...The socks worn by him
on his hand!

268
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:33,676
...Poor man! this guy stole from him
and is wearing it on his leg

269
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:36,180
Hey! why're you going away?
–Sit down..sit down

270
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:38,182
l'm the Power & Style of this
group, isn't it?

271
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:41,183
Finishing my Engineering studies
...l'm teaching software

272
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:44,353
...Earning Rs.6000! l'm footing

273
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:45,356

274
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:46,691
Atleast for that, sing a good song

Hey! sing a song! he's on the
better side of life, isn't it?

00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:52,864
Don't get angry! T.Shirt is

278
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:54,699
Look, how nicely he has

Sing boys! sing a song boys!!

280
00:23:42,654 --> 00:23:45,654
Some one read that book half yesterday
and kept it here

281
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:47,992
He took the book from there
and kept it here

282
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:49,326
What is your name?

283
00:23:49,327 --> 00:23:50,661
Go!

284
00:23:50,662 --> 00:23:53,497
...Subbuni! please give me Rs.500!

285
00:23:53,498 --> 00:23:54,999
Why?
–We're going to a movie!

286
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Atlast you've become responsible
in life

287
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:02,671
Book corner seat and enjoy
–Hey! book corner seats!

00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:05,009
We both are only going to
watch movie

290
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:08,010
Ugh! aren't you ashamed of saying
2 men going to a movie?

291
00:24:09,681 --> 00:24:10,681
Ashamed? Why should l?

292
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:13,682
lf a man goes to a movie with
his girl friend! it's a movie!

293
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:17,186
...Why're you spoiling the reputation of
theater by 2 men going to a film?

294
00:24:17,856 --> 00:24:20,856
What do you want me to do now?
–Listen to me, bring a girl each of you

295
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:24,028
Tell me, she's my lover!

296

....Go to movie, beach or
disco with them

297
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:30,868
Go anywhere you feel like not just Rs.500
l'll shell out even Rs.10,000!

298
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:31,368
No...no..no...

299
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:32,870
Rs.10,000?

300
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:35,871
Great Subbuni! you said
that so late!

301
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:40,042
Nothing's too late, just one minute!

302
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:44,546
Come here..will you come to a movie
tonight with me?

303
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:55,557
l didn't ask you! he had only
suggested me to ask you!

304
00:24:59,397 --> 00:25:00,564
l'll kill....l'll kill you!

305
00:25:00,565 --> 00:25:01,732
Even if you kill me
l'm not bothered!

306
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:03,400
You've seen her blasting me, isn't it?

307
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:05,736
That's why, l don't like
modern looking girls

308
00:25:05,737 --> 00:25:08,072
...lf l need it, l'll have
a quarter..

309
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:11,073
...l'll go for such Telugu
girls only!

310
00:25:12,744 --> 00:25:15,744
My taste is good, he's one whose
taste is totally waste!

311
00:25:15,914 --> 00:25:17,748
He's allergic towards girls!

312
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:19,416
Such a big lecture for just Rs.500!

313
00:25:19,417 --> 00:25:22,417
Look! chasing girls! spending
on them wastefully

314
00:25:23,088 --> 00:25:25,589
...And then crying lastly
l can't & l won't do such things!

315
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:28,590
l've not yet met such a girl so...

316
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,760
Be it any girl, when are you going
to bring and show her to me

317
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:36,098
...That's alright Subbuni!

318
00:25:39,437 --> 00:25:42,437
...Girl means!

319
00:25:43,775 --> 00:25:46,775

322
00:26:58,183 --> 00:27:00,184
What are you blabbering?

323

Where are you calling from?

324
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:30,941
What's the news?
–Subbuni, l've seen the girl!

325
00:28:30,942 --> 00:28:33,942
Where did you see her?

326
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:50,792
Sometimes in life we meet
unwittingly some people

327
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:54,296
We may not know then...

328
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:57,632
...That meeting has a special
place in our life!

329
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:05,307

l feel there's something between us!

331
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:13,315
But, l don't know, what's that?

332
00:29:36,674 --> 00:29:39,674
Hey! for me!..Hey! for me

Hey! come boys! let's go and
greet the couple

339
00:30:01,032 --> 00:30:04,032
Just now you said no, isn't it?
–l've changed my mind, come.....

340
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:09,039
Looks like my life itself

That girl!? Reena Joseph

351
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:38,902
She's working with Bangalore Ford!

352
00:30:38,903 --> 00:30:41,071
She's a CA! Long back l too

353
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:42,406

355
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:46,243
Shall l tell you truth?

356
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:49,244
No one is looking at you both
everyone's watching her only

357
00:30:49,414 --> 00:30:51,415
Did you come here to tell
me, only this?

358
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:54,251
l knew it, when you clicked
her entire roll!

359
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:55,419
First you go away from here!

360
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,920
You bloody! did you
observe that also?

361
00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:59,423
Buddy! please introduce me to her!

362
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:01,758
You?
–Why?

363
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:02,759
You hate girls, isn't it?

364
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,760
Are you still thinking me
to be like that only?

365
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,598
After seeing such a girl....
please introduce me to her

366
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:09,433
Go..first, you go away from here

367
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:12,434
Buddy! lf l strangle your neck
you'll be dead

368
00:31:12,437 --> 00:31:15,437
l'm not your buddy now
l'm a groom! go away!

369
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,441
l'm leaving you just because
you're a groom.

370
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:18,609
lf you fail to introduce
her to me!

371
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:21,610
...You'll never celebrate your first
night in your life, it's my curse

372
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:40,295
l know that!

373
00:32:02,153 --> 00:32:04,988
ls it true, what he's saying
l'm unable to believe!

374
00:32:04,989 --> 00:32:07,989
Hey! did you talk to her?

375
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,994
Did she talk to you?

376
00:32:10,995 --> 00:32:13,563
Did she make any silent gestures?

377
00:32:13,564 --> 00:32:15,999
Not even that..
then, it's a waste!

378
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,334
You go for another girl!

379
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:20,335
Buddy! till now, did l ever
talk about any girl?

380
00:32:20,838 --> 00:32:22,339
There were many girls in
our college, isn't it?

381
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:25,340
Chembaruthi of Chidambaram
was a great girl!

382
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:28,443
What was that Kerala beauty's name?

383
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:32,049
l never even gave a passing
look at them

384
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:34,685
No one ever had disturbed
me like this?

385
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:36,687
This girl has upset me totally!

386
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:39,688
She's a demoness
–No, buddy

387
00:32:44,195 --> 00:32:46,196
...Beautiful face!

388
00:32:46,197 --> 00:32:49,197
...Dot on the forehead!

389
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,200
Tender fingers!

390
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:56,206
...Buddy!

391
00:32:56,207 --> 00:32:57,040
...Please forgive me!

392
00:32:57,041 --> 00:32:58,375
Why?

393
00:32:58,376 --> 00:33:00,877
As you were describing her beauty
l too enjoyed it!

394
00:33:00,878 --> 00:33:02,212
Then, what man?

395
00:33:02,213 --> 00:33:03,880
You're saying, face, dot, roots!

396
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:06,550
lt's fingers! 
–Okay!

397
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:09,551
Nothing is matching with
your personality!

398
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:13,221
Not only this buddy! if l say one more
thing, you'll never believe it!

399
00:33:14,058 --> 00:33:16,226
l didn't believe, what you've
told already!

400
00:33:16,227 --> 00:33:18,729
Come on tell, buddy! we'll believe
whatever you may say

401
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:20,864
lf you say, l'm not a man
l'll believe even that

402
00:33:20,865 --> 00:33:23,567
Hey! isn't it true man?

403
00:33:23,568 --> 00:33:24,735
Don't get angry girl!

404
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:26,403
Hey! look there!
–What's it buddy?

405
00:33:26,404 --> 00:33:27,571
There's a girl next to sister–in-law!

406
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:29,406
ls it Okay?
–lt.'s out of focus, buddy!

407
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:32,407
What's there in it?
Let's focus it!

408
00:33:33,077 --> 00:33:34,578
He has come back!

409
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:37,579
Ready!

410
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:41,752
What's this man!– lt's invisible!

411
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:44,753
Hey! l've not yet taken it out!

412
00:33:44,922 --> 00:33:47,922
Don't tense me up! take it out
...take it out!

413
00:33:49,927 --> 00:33:50,927
Tumbler!

414
00:33:50,928 --> 00:33:53,096
You rogue! did you steal
it from a wine shop!

415
00:33:53,097 --> 00:33:54,598
No!

416
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:56,933
That girl's lipstick!

417
00:33:56,934 --> 00:33:59,934
This is the glass used by that girl
to drink water

418
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:04,606
Hey! shut up! why're you dancing like
possessed one in a Temple?

419
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:09,613
Better than this, you could've
done another thing! – What?

420
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:11,782
The banana leaf left by her
after eating food.

421
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:14,117
lf you had washed it and hung it
here in a frame

422
00:34:14,118 --> 00:34:15,285
lt would look fantastic!

423
00:34:15,286 --> 00:34:18,286
You could become first man to frame a
lover's left out leaf in this world!

424
00:34:18,956 --> 00:34:20,123
No, buddy..that's...

425
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:21,792
What? No buddy! you were
boasting that day!

426
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:24,127
...You hate woman and you'll not
waste time chasing women

427
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:25,529
Looks like you're going to
waste yourself

428
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:27,130
That's what, l'm unable
to understand

429
00:34:27,131 --> 00:34:28,465
l've understood, buddy
–What?

430
00:34:28,466 --> 00:34:31,466
lf that girl refuses you,not just today
your life will become a waste

431
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:33,303
What shall we do now?

432
00:34:33,304 --> 00:34:34,971
Shall we all have a drinking
binge and sleep?

433
00:34:34,972 --> 00:34:35,806
Good idea buddy!

434
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:38,308
He's asking an idea for love and you're
suggesting what we do everyday

435
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:41,309
Let's pack our baggages and
go to Bangalore!

436
00:34:41,312 --> 00:34:44,312
...We'll find sister-in-law there

437
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:48,483
No need!
–Why?

438
00:34:49,153 --> 00:34:52,153
They say heart will get thrilled and
go haywire on falling in love

439
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:57,258
...Just now, it has started in me

440
00:34:57,728 --> 00:35:00,728
Let it pick up speed!

441
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:04,000
l started liking this feeling
very much!

442
00:35:04,001 --> 00:35:07,001
We'll go to Bangalore later!

443
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:11,007
Look, she's coming!

444
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:13,443
Will you please come here?
No problem! come near me!

445
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:15,512
ls it your cell phone?

446
00:35:15,513 --> 00:35:17,848
You're paying your bills
correctly, isn't it?

447
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:20,849
My grandma is seriously ill at
home, a friend informed me

448
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:23,353
lf you give your cell phone
l'll talk to her before she dies

449
00:35:23,354 --> 00:35:24,688
Please, give me!

450
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:26,189
l think you're new to the town!

451
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:29,190
l'll talk!

452
00:35:30,027 --> 00:35:33,027
ls it Pepsi Uma?
How are you?

453
00:35:34,198 --> 00:35:36,533
Can you telecast a song
from film 'Sakhi'

454
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:37,534
Which song?

455
00:35:37,535 --> 00:35:39,202
Wait! l'll ask my girl friend
and tell you

456
00:35:39,203 --> 00:35:40,203
Which song shall l ask?

457
00:35:40,204 --> 00:35:42,372
Are you talking with Uma saying
your grandma is serious?

458
00:35:42,373 --> 00:35:44,040
My grandma's name is also Uma

459
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:47,041
Yes, she'll drink Pepsi and
give me great kisses

460
00:35:47,378 --> 00:35:49,379
...l told for that only

461
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:52,380
l spent few minutes interestingly

462
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:54,050
Have you come?

463
00:35:54,051 --> 00:35:55,552
What did you ask with
that girl?

464
00:35:55,553 --> 00:35:56,987
This tie doesn't match
with your shirt

465
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,221
Keep the tie & remove your shirt

466
00:35:58,222 --> 00:35:59,723
What did you ask with
that girl?

467
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:01,224
Buddy! l asked time

468
00:36:01,225 --> 00:36:02,559
This is what l thought

469
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,393
Do you know, who's that girl?

470
00:36:03,394 --> 00:36:04,227
Who's she?

471
00:36:04,228 --> 00:36:07,063
She's my M.D's daughter, lf you behave
badly with her, l'll lose my image

472
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:08,398
No buddy! l talked to her
about your promotion

473
00:36:08,399 --> 00:36:10,066
Oh God! Did you talk about
my promotion?

474
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:13,067
Do you know, what l'm worth?
How much?

475
00:36:13,905 --> 00:36:15,071
ls your head spinning?

476
00:36:15,072 --> 00:36:18,072
Till now, l wore only one
God's dollar only

477
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:21,077
l don't know about any other dollars
–Shut up man! come, let's go

478
00:36:21,078 --> 00:36:24,078
...Take me along with you
...l'll be like a stepney

479
00:36:24,248 --> 00:36:27,248
Who's that?

480
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:33,421
Did you see those girls
how they over took us?

481
00:36:34,258 --> 00:36:35,258
Shall l overtake them?

482
00:36:35,259 --> 00:36:38,094
No! if they fall down 100 people
will volunteer to help them

483
00:36:38,095 --> 00:36:39,262
...lf we fall down?

484
00:36:39,263 --> 00:36:40,931
Only 4 people will come
...as pall bearers

485
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:43,266
Oh! Buddy! you've improved your
General Knowledge!

486
00:36:43,267 --> 00:36:46,267
...You went as if you were
in a race!

487
00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:49,105
Now, you've stopped at signal!

488
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:52,106
That's why! they said slow &
steady wins the race

489
00:36:52,109 --> 00:36:55,109
Do you want to smoke?

490
00:36:56,113 --> 00:36:57,447
...lt'll make your mouth to stink!

491
00:36:57,448 --> 00:36:59,449
lf we drink whisky the
stink will go away!

492
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:02,450
You got it, isn't it?
–Hey, it's ford

493
00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:09,624
Hey! that girl!

494
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:14,796
Signal's on!
–That Bangalore girl!

495
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:20,802
She's going away!
–They're blaring horns

496
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:27,308
Where are my specs?
lt's here!

What's this? They've hanged Lorry

00:37:35,486 --> 00:37:38,486
There's a lemon here..

499
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:47,831
lf l had Gin with me...

500
00:37:47,832 --> 00:37:50,166
Hey! wastrel! did you come out
after informing at home?

501
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:53,167
Am l going in flight to come
after informing at home?

502
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:56,838
What are doing under the lorry
after watching late night movie on T.V.?

503
00:37:58,009 --> 00:38:01,009
You too watched midnight masala
after getting drunk & hit me

504
00:38:04,515 --> 00:38:06,182
Why did you take that lemon?

505

They had hung it wastely here
so, l've taken and eating it

506
00:38:09,353 --> 00:38:11,521
You wastrel!
–Why did they hang it here?

507
00:38:11,522 --> 00:38:13,690
Hung it, so that lorry runs safely

508
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:16,691
Rogues? there are 750 spare
parts inside

509
00:38:17,194 --> 00:38:19,863
Will it run for this lemon without
running on those parts?

510
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:21,698
l can't change your attitudes!

511
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:23,199

Look! he has come to draw the map

Did you see sir! this rogue
is driving without license?

522
00:38:53,731 --> 00:38:56,399
He's complaining about me
as if he's an lAS officer

523
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,902
Sir, he's a cleaner! he doesn't have a
license and lorry doesn't have a permit

524
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:01,237
Where's the driver?
–Hey! tell me, vehicle number

00:39:01,238 --> 00:39:04,238

00:39:08,245 --> 00:39:09,245
Tell me your bike's number!

529
00:39:11,415 --> 00:39:12,749
You were riding the bike, isn't it?

530
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:14,918
l didn't ride sir! l had asked for
lift and travelling on pillion!

531
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:17,587
An enemy of me drove the vehicle!
–What enemy?

532
00:39:17,588 --> 00:39:18,254
Yes!

533
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:20,824
lsn't he an enemy one who abandons
you on seeing a girl?

534
00:39:20,825 --> 00:39:23,093
Alright, l can't avoid booking
a case

535
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:26,094
Oh God! in such time one

00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:29,430
Can you lend me Rs.3?
–He has already taken it at previous signal

537
00:39:29,767 --> 00:39:30,600
He would've taken it!

538
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:32,268
lsn't he a Collection King?!

539
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:34,104
Will you pay fine in court?

00:39:34,105 --> 00:39:37,105

00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:41,611
Greetings sir!

00:39:41,612 --> 00:39:44,612
But, he doesn't know me!

544
00:40:12,476 --> 00:40:15,476
Skirt chasing! No smell
–What? Get lost man!

545
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:28,324
Hey! will you escape after
putting me into a fix?

546
00:40:28,325 --> 00:40:30,660
Your MD's daughter's curse
has come true

547
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:33,496
Look at these Police baton marks
Police have beaten me black & blue

548
00:40:33,497 --> 00:40:36,166
You're a friend, who should've helped
me in distress but, you left me in peril!

549
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:37,333
...You're no more my friend

550
00:40:37,334 --> 00:40:38,501
l'll buy you a quarter whisky

551
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:40,503
What did you say?
–l'll buy you a quarter whisky!

552
00:40:40,504 --> 00:40:41,838
You're my bosom pal!

553
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:42,672
Look side way!

554
00:40:42,673 --> 00:40:44,507
Not that side.....this side!

555
00:40:44,508 --> 00:40:46,176
Did you see her?

556
00:40:46,177 --> 00:40:48,678
She's that Bangalore girl!

557
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:50,346
...Next to her is..that out
of focus girl only!

558
00:40:50,347 --> 00:40:52,849
Wrong! now, she's in focus
–Yes, shall we go & speak to them?

559
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:55,685
No, l'll talk to them! you stand
next to me, understood?

560
00:40:55,686 --> 00:40:57,687
You want me to watch, that's all

561
00:40:57,688 --> 00:40:59,689
Buddy! they're gone!

562
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:00,690
You don't worry!

563
00:41:00,691 --> 00:41:03,691
She may've gone to buy
some fancy items

564
00:41:04,361 --> 00:41:05,695
Let's go inside & see
–Come...

565
00:41:05,696 --> 00:41:07,530
l missed her because of you only!

566
00:41:07,531 --> 00:41:10,033
First, let's check in the canteen
it'll be helpful in both ways

567
00:41:10,034 --> 00:41:10,867
ls it that important!?

568
00:41:10,868 --> 00:41:11,701
Then, what about my whisky?

569
00:41:11,702 --> 00:41:14,537
l'm crying for missing her and
you're worried about your whisky?

570
00:41:14,538 --> 00:41:17,538
You must return it on it's due date

571
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:20,877
Subbuni, l just saw that girl!

572
00:41:20,878 --> 00:41:21,878
That Bangalore girl! Reena

573
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:24,047
l said that day my heart skipped a
beat on seeing her isn't it!

574
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:26,049
l saw her today on the road
...on the other side!

575
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:29,050
l went after her to talk to her
but she vanished

576
00:41:31,055 --> 00:41:33,056
...l don't know, where's that girl?

577
00:41:33,057 --> 00:41:36,057
l'm afraid whether l'll meet
her again or not?

578
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:45,066
...She's very beautiful

579
00:41:47,071 --> 00:41:50,071
What do you say?

580
00:41:50,574 --> 00:41:53,574
Get lost man!

581
00:41:53,577 --> 00:41:55,011
He has fallen...

582
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:57,580
Look buddy! you don't worry!

583
00:41:57,581 --> 00:42:00,581
l'm promising on Napoleon
you'll not miss your girl

584
00:42:01,919 --> 00:42:04,919
Buddy! don't believe him
he'll change his words after drinks

585
00:42:05,422 --> 00:42:06,589
Great man has come!

586
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:09,590
l'm not one to drink duplicate
and vomit on roads

587
00:42:10,094 --> 00:42:12,929
l'm the one to drink original
stuff and talk enthusiastically

588
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:15,930
Sister-in-law! What do you lack?

589
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:20,101
You would've eaten a pizza or a burger
and slept peacefully with a doll

590
00:42:22,773 --> 00:42:25,773
Do you know, he has become
a doll with your thoughts?

591
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:27,944
Don't get worried thinking
about her

592
00:42:27,945 --> 00:42:30,945
My heart says that girl will definitely
fall in love with you

593
00:42:31,615 --> 00:42:34,615
Don't believe him, he's talking all
rubbish for few drinks

594
00:42:34,618 --> 00:42:37,618
He's going overboard? lf l get cranky
l'll use choicest epithets

595
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:41,289
Then what? we know she's from
Bangalore, he met her there only

596
00:42:41,625 --> 00:42:43,293
Surprisingly, today met her
by chance here

597
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:44,961
lf she goes away to Bangalore tonight?

598
00:42:44,962 --> 00:42:47,130
lf l punch you, your face
will need a surgery

599
00:42:47,131 --> 00:42:49,299
Hey! think positively!

600
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:52,300
They're confusing you without consulting
you, buddy! don't believe them

601
00:42:52,636 --> 00:42:55,471
Three weeks ago he saw
a girl in Bangalore...

602
00:42:55,472 --> 00:42:57,140
He saw, isn't it?....

603
00:42:57,141 --> 00:42:59,976
You're thinking about that girl
only isn't it or not? –Yes!

604
00:42:59,977 --> 00:43:02,977
Again, why did he see her
in this city?

605
00:43:03,814 --> 00:43:06,482
What's going on between them?
shall l tell? –Come on tell!

606
00:43:06,483 --> 00:43:09,483
Some waves are being emanated
from you both, buddy

607
00:43:10,654 --> 00:43:13,654
These simple waves change to love waves
only after you talk to her, remember!

608
00:43:15,993 --> 00:43:17,493
Otherwise, she'll become some other
man's girl friend

609
00:43:17,494 --> 00:43:20,494
...Sorry! l shouted at you
l'll have one more round

610
00:43:34,178 --> 00:43:35,511
l'm Sekhar speaking!

611
00:43:35,512 --> 00:43:38,512
l told you about love waves isn't it!
it has started working out for you

612
00:43:38,682 --> 00:43:40,183
Hey! what are you up to man?

613
00:43:40,184 --> 00:43:41,684
Hey! don't waste time talking to me!

614
00:43:41,685 --> 00:43:44,520
Even if you haven't brushed your teeth
come fast, she's infront of me

615
00:43:44,521 --> 00:43:45,855
Where?

616
00:43:45,856 --> 00:43:48,024
ln Gandhi nagar Market, next to
Lord Shiva's temple!

617
00:43:48,025 --> 00:43:51,025
Come immediately there!
–l'm coming there!

618
00:43:55,366 --> 00:43:56,366
Where's she? where's she?

619
00:43:56,367 --> 00:43:59,367
Look! there!
–There?

620
00:44:01,205 --> 00:44:04,040
She? l'll beat you!
ls she that girl!?

621
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:07,041
She's not that girl! but she's
friend of that girl!

622
00:44:07,878 --> 00:44:08,878
That means!

623
00:44:08,879 --> 00:44:11,879
Only if we impress a PA
we can impress his boss

624
00:44:11,882 --> 00:44:14,882
Likewise only if we can impress a
guard we can impress a lady cook...

625
00:44:15,052 --> 00:44:15,718
l'll shell out your teeth!

626
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:18,719
Likewise! to impress that girl
we must impress this girl first

627
00:44:21,558 --> 00:44:24,227
l'll impress her! you impress
that girl...come..

628
00:44:24,228 --> 00:44:25,561
Sir, please buy something.

629
00:44:25,562 --> 00:44:26,663
Will you sell that tube light?

630
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,131

634
00:44:33,971 --> 00:44:36,971
Hey! don't suggest women about vegetables!
don't they know that?

635
00:44:39,309 --> 00:44:42,309
Don't talk too much!
Do business properly

636
00:44:45,482 --> 00:44:47,917
Give!...give...give!

637
00:44:47,918 --> 00:44:49,585
What's this? Look at him!

638
00:44:49,586 --> 00:44:51,187
Look, they've taken away my list!

639
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:52,755
Why did you take away her list?

640
00:44:52,756 --> 00:44:54,424
With whom are you talking
what are you talking?

641
00:44:54,425 --> 00:44:55,191
Don't talk too much!

642
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:56,993
Why is the capsicum so large?

643
00:44:56,994 --> 00:44:58,995
Sir! lt's a cucumber!
–cucumber?! don't l know that?

644
00:44:58,996 --> 00:45:01,197
Why is papaya so small?

He's spoiling business in

00:45:07,438 --> 00:45:09,138

Will you take if she gives you?
–Sir, l'm a poor man.

You flattered me with sentiment

663
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:36,065
You flattered me with poor man's
sentiments isn't it?

l couldn't meet her since
l was away!

686
00:46:20,911 --> 00:46:23,112
Suddenly, we saw you both
on road

687
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:25,281
Met with an accident
we met with a accident

688
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:27,784
We thought of contacting you
but you vanished 
–Yes

689
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:29,185
You say, you're Reena's friend!
–Yes

690
00:46:29,186 --> 00:46:32,186
But, don't you know that she has
been transferred to this place

691
00:46:34,825 --> 00:46:36,359
Both are just the same! 
–Yes!

692
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:38,294
What do you want now?

693
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:41,130
We both are family friends
it's an emergency

694
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:43,332
lf you give her phone number
l'll call her at Bangalore

695
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:45,334
Her phone number is...

696
00:46:45,335 --> 00:46:48,335
Beach road! 422 is
lndra Nagar exchange

697
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:51,407
One minute! you know Reena isn't it?

698
00:46:51,408 --> 00:46:54,408
He must get to know her
hereafter only

699
00:46:54,511 --> 00:46:57,346
Get to know her? First, forget
that phone number

700
00:46:57,347 --> 00:47:00,347
We forgot...forgot, we forgot!

701
00:47:01,018 --> 00:47:02,418
Forgot isn't it?
–Yes!

702
00:47:02,419 --> 00:47:05,419
Look Madam, l'm folding hands
and telling you the truth

703
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:08,291
My friend has fallen in love
with your friend

704
00:47:08,292 --> 00:47:09,659
Look, he has become like this!

705
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,828
He'll not eat and is not
allowing me also to eat

706
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:14,397
He'll not sleep and is spoiling
my sleep also

707
00:47:14,398 --> 00:47:17,233
He's torturing my life
–shut up

708
00:47:17,234 --> 00:47:20,234
Even if l introduce you to her
or give you her phone number

709
00:47:20,571 --> 00:47:21,838
She'll never talk to you

710
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:22,972
Why? ls she dumb?

711
00:47:22,973 --> 00:47:25,007
No, she's already engaged!

712
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:27,210
Her marriage has been fixed
when she was quite young

713
00:47:27,211 --> 00:47:30,211
That's why! l advice you to forget
and not to waste your time

714
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:33,848
Hey! Rajesh, why're you going away
we're talking about you only! go away!

715
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:39,520
Leave about him! vegetable seller
gave it...your money! keep it

716
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:42,158
Have you decided about your lover?

717
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:45,159
Lover?

718
00:47:53,303 --> 00:47:54,770
Quick man!

719
00:47:54,771 --> 00:47:57,240
Why're you shouting on him?

720
00:47:57,241 --> 00:48:00,241
What did he do to you?
why're you angry on him?

721
00:48:01,111 --> 00:48:04,111
l never expected such a beautiful
girl will come into my life

722
00:48:05,949 --> 00:48:08,084
l never expected, she'll come
vanish away

723
00:48:08,085 --> 00:48:10,753
ls she gone? then what?
–Have you already decided?

724
00:48:10,754 --> 00:48:13,489
lt has not yet taken off and
you're talking about landing

725
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:15,591
You've not even approached
that girl yet

726
00:48:15,592 --> 00:48:17,593
She has warned us in so
clear terms isn't it?

727
00:48:17,594 --> 00:48:19,295
That she's engaged and her
marriage has been fixed

728
00:48:19,296 --> 00:48:22,296
Why're you asking me to approach
her even after knowing that?

729
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,801
Already girls don't go down
well with me

730
00:48:25,802 --> 00:48:26,903
And this one to interfere

731
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:29,904
People like you seeing'Titanic' movie
is a mere waste

732
00:48:30,107 --> 00:48:33,107
ln a gap, didn't the hero make the already
engaged heroine to fall in love

733
00:48:35,112 --> 00:48:37,980
You're right! but, who lost
in the end?

734
00:48:37,981 --> 00:48:39,148
Boy only!

735
00:48:39,149 --> 00:48:42,149
Even in Titanic film!
Girl is only on the safer side

736
00:48:42,552 --> 00:48:44,287
How many liters sir?...2000 liters!

737
00:48:44,288 --> 00:48:45,922
What's it sir?!
–lmpossible isn't it? –Yes!

738
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:47,757
2 litres! –Yes sir!
–Go!

739
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:50,758
lf you hadn't loved that girl

740
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:54,094
Why did you jump the median after
leaving me in an accident?

741
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:58,933
Look! they've passed a New Rule
in the 21st century

742
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:02,970
A true lover will get his girl

743
00:49:03,473 --> 00:49:06,473
Don't worry about her many suitors
they're not in the list

744
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:16,116
Buddy love waves! it's running
between your hearts

745
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:19,820
What's the girl's phone number?

746
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:22,258
Your date of birth!

747
00:49:22,259 --> 00:49:23,492
Look, you couldn't say it

748
00:49:23,493 --> 00:49:25,995
You could remember that
but couldn't remember this

749
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:27,496
That's what Love is!

750
00:49:27,497 --> 00:49:30,497
You call her on phone and talk to her
definitely your love will be a success

751
00:49:49,052 --> 00:49:49,986
Yes!

752
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:52,987
Calling from Telephone dept.
ls your phone working properly?

753
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:56,657
lt's clear!
–Okay! tell me your address

754
00:55:59,956 --> 00:56:01,290
What happened?

755
00:56:01,291 --> 00:56:04,291
Line got cut.

756
00:56:06,162 --> 00:56:09,162
What did he say?

757
00:56:09,733 --> 00:56:11,567
What did he say?

758
00:56:11,568 --> 00:56:14,568
lt seems he'll come next week.

759
00:56:15,605 --> 00:56:18,605
...He has asked me to take a week off

760
00:56:19,109 --> 00:56:20,776
lt seems, l can't avoid
meeting him

761
00:56:20,777 --> 00:56:22,978
What did you reply for that?

762
00:56:22,979 --> 00:56:24,613
...Before that, line went off

763
00:56:24,614 --> 00:56:27,316
You both must definitely
meet and discuss

764
00:56:27,317 --> 00:56:28,617
Why?

765
00:56:28,618 --> 00:56:31,618
Then, will you marry without
even seeing him

766
00:56:38,094 --> 00:56:41,094
l'll talk to him...l'll...

767
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:44,398
...ls it Rajeev!?

768
00:56:45,502 --> 00:56:46,635
...Reena's friend

769
00:56:46,636 --> 00:56:49,238
lt seems you wanted to meet Reena

770
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:52,239
Atleast you have seen her photo
She doesn't even know, how you look

771
00:56:54,043 --> 00:56:56,378
...Son of her Father's friend

772
00:56:56,379 --> 00:56:59,379
...They say, he's good looking

773
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:02,416
She talked to you on phone thrice
she knows about you, only that

774
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:05,621
So, first you meet and try
to understand each other

775
00:57:05,622 --> 00:57:08,622
You're coming next week isn't it
l'll make her to take off from Office

776
00:57:11,561 --> 00:57:14,561
What happened?

777
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:17,597
Again, line's gone dead!

778
00:57:21,871 --> 00:57:24,871
Old man is thinking! Don't know what
problem he's going to create newly

779
00:57:26,409 --> 00:57:29,409
According to you, that boy is coming
from America to meet Reena –Yes

780
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:34,614
You say, he'll come from America to meet
her, then decide about marriage

781
00:57:39,923 --> 00:57:42,758
That girl hasn't seen him
till now, isn't it?

782
00:57:42,759 --> 00:57:43,559
No!

783
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:45,260
Did l ask you?
–No!

784
00:57:45,261 --> 00:57:47,496
Keep shut up & listen!
–Yes!

785
00:57:47,497 --> 00:57:50,497
Do you love her so much?

786
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:57,137
Now, l'll tell you! Still there's a week
for that American to come isn't it?

787
00:57:57,874 --> 00:58:00,874
That means 7 days! ln the meantime
you're going to that girl's house

788
00:58:02,745 --> 00:58:04,079
What's this Subbuni?
What are you saying?

789
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:05,280
Won't it end in trouble
if l go there?

790
00:58:05,281 --> 00:58:06,281
Yes!
–Then?

791
00:58:06,282 --> 00:58:07,916
lf you go as Rajesh
it'll lead to problems

792
00:58:07,917 --> 00:58:10,185
But, if you go there as that
American boy, Rajeev?

793
00:58:10,186 --> 00:58:13,186
lmpersonating!? lt'll be a
Police case

794
00:58:13,890 --> 00:58:15,657
l'll sew up your mouth!

795
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:17,860
Just a heart is not enough to
fall in love

You must've courage!

797
00:58:19,028 --> 00:58:22,028

00:58:40,416 --> 00:58:41,917
...Problem will be solved

805
00:58:41,918 --> 00:58:43,752
Will it be solved!?
lf it turns serious

806
00:58:43,753 --> 00:58:45,087
lt's quite natural

807
00:58:45,088 --> 00:58:47,756
A girl you love is like Camphor!

808
00:58:47,757 --> 00:58:49,424
...ln anger, she'll burn brightly!

809
00:58:49,425 --> 00:58:51,426
...When calms down! She'll
cool you down

810
00:58:51,427 --> 00:58:54,427
...Don't experiment with his life
Do you think, it'll succeed?

811
00:58:55,598 --> 00:58:58,433
lf it's true love, even a
stone heart will melt

812
00:58:58,434 --> 00:59:01,434
This is just a women's heart
melting it, is very easy

813
00:59:06,442 --> 00:59:08,944
Come on, give me your hand, boy!

l thought your head is empty

815
00:59:13,783 --> 00:59:16,783
But, there's an extra large hole!
in your idea! Did you observe it?

816
00:59:18,955 --> 00:59:21,790
ln the one week he makes that
girl to fall in love with him

817
00:59:21,791 --> 00:59:24,791
lf that American boy calls up
even once! He's finished

818
00:59:25,128 --> 00:59:28,128
...He's planning to put us
all behind the bars

819
00:59:29,465 --> 00:59:32,465
You idiot! When you can
think like that?

820
00:59:32,802 --> 00:59:34,803

Tell me, without biting my ear

Hey! Bathroom is on that side!

They'll kill us with
CBl enquiry...etc.

01:01:25,248 --> 01:01:28,248
Look! l've snapped it

849
01:01:39,262 --> 01:01:42,262
Who sent this?

850
01:02:13,463 --> 01:02:16,463
Who sent this?

851
01:02:29,645 --> 01:02:32,645
Flowers again? Are you
making fun of me?

852
01:02:33,649 --> 01:02:36,649
Some mad man is sending me flowers...

853
01:02:36,986 --> 01:02:39,986
...And you're bringing it...

854
01:02:41,157 --> 01:02:43,158
l'm that Madman!

855
01:02:43,159 --> 01:02:45,827
What's it? Love!!?!

856
01:02:45,828 --> 01:02:48,828
Do you think, it'll be poetic
How much did you spend on it?

857
01:02:49,832 --> 01:02:52,832
Rs 3000...

858
01:03:06,349 --> 01:03:09,349
We had talked on phone also
....like this....

859
01:03:12,021 --> 01:03:15,021
l came to meet you.

860
01:03:15,191 --> 01:03:18,191
You said, you'll come next week.

861
01:03:18,194 --> 01:03:21,194
Flight was available, so l came early

862
01:03:21,531 --> 01:03:24,531
l'm not able to believe

863
01:03:25,034 --> 01:03:26,868
l've been standing with a flower
since a long time

864
01:03:26,869 --> 01:03:29,704
lf you take it, l'll be very happy!

865
01:03:29,705 --> 01:03:32,705
Can l come in?

866
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:37,710
lf you stand blocking the door
and ask me to come in...

867
01:03:47,056 --> 01:03:48,723
Can you take off from
the office?

868
01:03:48,724 --> 01:03:51,724
lmpossible! l've to inform them
well in advance

869
01:03:52,061 --> 01:03:55,061
Please try it for my sake
l'm free for 4 – 5 days

870
01:03:56,899 --> 01:03:59,899
l thought we can open our hearts
and try to understand each other

871
01:04:03,072 --> 01:04:06,072
Difficult...but l'll try!

872
01:04:08,911 --> 01:04:10,745
l want to make a phone call

873
01:04:10,746 --> 01:04:13,746
Phone is out of order for
past 2 days!

874
01:04:18,588 --> 01:04:20,422
lndian telephones are always
like this only

875
01:04:20,423 --> 01:04:23,423
American phones never go dead even
once also, do you know that?

876
01:04:33,102 --> 01:04:35,937
What else do you've in chicken?

877
01:04:35,938 --> 01:04:38,440
l think something vegetarian will be
better ...lt'll be good here

878
01:04:38,441 --> 01:04:41,441
When you talked to Uncle you said
you like chicken & Chinese food

879
01:04:42,445 --> 01:04:45,445
That's why, l ordered!

880
01:04:54,123 --> 01:04:57,123
We had met once earlier also
do you remember? -When?

881
01:04:58,127 --> 01:05:00,128
ln Bangalore!

882
01:05:00,129 --> 01:05:02,464
Don't you remember it?

883
01:05:02,465 --> 01:05:03,465
No!

884
01:05:03,466 --> 01:05:05,967
l was 8 years old, then!

885
01:05:05,968 --> 01:05:08,968
Oh! That one! l do remember it nicely

886
01:05:09,972 --> 01:05:12,972
ln your Aunty's marriage you & your pals
locked me up in a dark room

887
01:05:13,309 --> 01:05:14,809
Do you remember it?
–Yes!

888
01:05:14,810 --> 01:05:17,312
Do you know how much l had cried?
–Yes

889
01:05:17,313 --> 01:05:19,147
Uncle also shouted at you!

890
01:05:19,148 --> 01:05:22,148
He's always like that only

891
01:05:22,652 --> 01:05:24,653
Only then, isn't it?

892
01:05:24,654 --> 01:05:27,155
You were always teasing me

893
01:05:27,156 --> 01:05:28,323
lt was only then!

894
01:05:28,324 --> 01:05:30,825
l had only Lucy as my friend then

895
01:05:30,826 --> 01:05:32,661
You remember Lucy isn't it?

896
01:05:32,662 --> 01:05:34,329
l remember nicely

897
01:05:34,330 --> 01:05:36,998
Dark, tall, used to come with
a bobbed hair cut...

898
01:05:36,999 --> 01:05:39,999
Tall? Lucy was my pup!

899
01:05:40,336 --> 01:05:42,003
Even you were giving her a
both with a hose pipe

900
01:05:42,004 --> 01:05:45,004
That's it...lt used come like
a mad dog, tall, black...

901
01:05:49,178 --> 01:05:52,178
...l don't remember anything

902
01:05:56,018 --> 01:05:57,519
...Shall we eat then

903
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:00,520
Definitely!

904
01:06:56,912 --> 01:06:59,581
Aren't you feeling well?

905
01:06:59,582 --> 01:07:00,915
Nothing!

906
01:07:00,916 --> 01:07:02,917
What's wrong with me?

907
01:07:02,918 --> 01:07:05,086
Whom do you resemble?
–Resemble?

908
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:08,087
Do you resemble your mother or father?

909
01:07:08,424 --> 01:07:10,091
l resemble my grandfather

910
01:07:10,092 --> 01:07:13,092
Resemble grandfather?
Where's he now?

911
01:07:14,597 --> 01:07:17,597
You'll definitely meet him

912
01:07:19,268 --> 01:07:21,770
What's the distance between
Seattle & Chicago?

913
01:07:21,771 --> 01:07:24,771
What's the distance between
Seattle & Chicago?

914
01:07:25,608 --> 01:07:28,276
Didn't you go even once?
Don't you know?

915
01:07:28,277 --> 01:07:30,278
l don't know

916
01:07:30,279 --> 01:07:33,279
Very near!

917
01:07:33,783 --> 01:07:35,617
lf we travel in my car it'll
be just 1 1/2 hours drive

918
01:07:35,618 --> 01:07:38,286
l know all the police en route
no one will stop me

919
01:07:38,287 --> 01:07:40,955
Flight will be very quick! you'll
land before you take off

920
01:07:40,956 --> 01:07:43,956
Nothing! my friend has settled
down there

921
01:07:44,126 --> 01:07:46,961
That's why, l inquired

922
01:07:46,962 --> 01:07:49,962
We'll go...we'll go to meet her
l'll take you there definitely

923
01:07:51,467 --> 01:07:54,467
Why? Aren't you interested
in going abroad?

924
01:07:55,971 --> 01:07:58,971
Going abroad and working there

925
01:08:04,814 --> 01:08:07,315
l like only lNDlA

926
01:08:07,316 --> 01:08:09,317
Foreign country can never become
motherland isn't it?

927
01:08:09,318 --> 01:08:11,486
Say like that

928
01:08:11,487 --> 01:08:14,487
Look's like it's going to work out
in my favour, deal cautiously boy!

929
01:09:03,372 --> 01:09:06,372
l got delayed!

930
01:09:06,375 --> 01:09:09,375
l got up very late

931
01:09:09,378 --> 01:09:12,378
l'm waiting for over an hour

932
01:09:13,382 --> 01:09:16,382
What can l do? my bike never
started even after many kicks

933
01:09:17,052 --> 01:09:18,887
l thought you know the
value of time

934
01:09:18,888 --> 01:09:21,888
l said, sorry isn't it?

935
01:09:26,228 --> 01:09:29,228
Reena! please listen to me
even after l said, sorry...

936
01:09:29,899 --> 01:09:31,232
Don't need an Auto, go away

937
01:09:31,233 --> 01:09:32,734
Where do you want to go, Madam?

938
01:09:32,735 --> 01:09:35,735
Reena, listen to me! l'll also
come, wait – wait

939
01:09:39,074 --> 01:09:42,074
Reena, stop!

940
01:09:42,244 --> 01:09:45,244
l said sorry isn't it?

941
01:09:47,416 --> 01:09:48,750
Sir, don't touch the meter

942
01:09:48,751 --> 01:09:51,751
l know your matter! you watch
carefully & drive

943
01:09:52,421 --> 01:09:55,421
So, what's your plan?

944
01:09:57,593 --> 01:09:58,760
What a sweat?

945
01:09:58,761 --> 01:10:01,761
How could you tolerate such
hot climate?

946
01:10:02,097 --> 01:10:05,097
Do you've mineral water?

947
01:10:12,441 --> 01:10:15,441
Don't lndia have AC Autos?
American Autos are fully AC!

948
01:10:16,612 --> 01:10:19,612
There'll be a bar here we can
enjoy Beer, while travelling

949
01:10:36,465 --> 01:10:39,465
Driver, could you stop Auto little
that side?

950
01:10:42,638 --> 01:10:45,638
Where's he?
–He has escaped, Madam

951
01:10:47,643 --> 01:10:50,643
Here only! stop!

952
01:10:53,482 --> 01:10:56,482
Do you know in America, boys don't
allow the girls to open their purses?

953
01:10:56,652 --> 01:10:58,653
l don't have change, Sir
–No problem!

954
01:10:58,654 --> 01:11:01,654
But, they'll leave half way isn't it?

955
01:11:02,157 --> 01:11:05,157
Suddenly, l met a friend
we last met in our childhood

956
01:11:05,828 --> 01:11:08,828
That's only!...to meet him
–l know all that! l've some work

957
01:11:23,178 --> 01:11:26,014
What's it?
–She left it in the Auto

958
01:11:26,015 --> 01:11:27,515
l'm not able to understand
this girl

959
01:11:27,516 --> 01:11:30,516
Not just this girl, we can never
understand any girl in this world

960
01:11:31,186 --> 01:11:33,855
Till we don't see them, they'll
be just ordinary girls

961
01:11:33,856 --> 01:11:36,357
The moment they'll come to know that
we've fallen in love with them

962
01:11:36,358 --> 01:11:37,358
They'll start behaving, Miss lndia

963
01:11:37,359 --> 01:11:40,359
That's what, l'm also saying

964
01:11:41,196 --> 01:11:43,197
l've a doubt with her behaviour

965
01:11:43,198 --> 01:11:45,033
May be she'll call home and
refuse this marriage

966
01:11:45,034 --> 01:11:48,034
lt's good, with your help that
Rajeev's image is badly bruised

967
01:11:48,704 --> 01:11:51,704
You once again disguise and say
you're Rajesh and marry her

968
01:11:52,374 --> 01:11:53,708
How many disguises?

969
01:11:53,709 --> 01:11:56,709
Like Kamalahasan go on wear as
many disguises us possible  –Yes

970
01:11:56,712 --> 01:11:58,212
l don't know whether your love
will succeed or not

971
01:11:58,213 --> 01:11:59,380
You'll definitely get an Oscar

972
01:11:59,381 --> 01:12:02,216
For such an act, an Oscar?

973
01:12:02,217 --> 01:12:04,052
What?
–What's today's date?

974
01:12:04,053 --> 01:12:05,887
6th isn't it?
–Yes

975
01:12:05,888 --> 01:12:07,889
Still love waves are working!

976
01:12:07,890 --> 01:12:10,890
Hey! Talk to me......talk to me

977
01:12:11,894 --> 01:12:14,894
Look, she has written birthday
for your attention

978
01:12:15,230 --> 01:12:16,064
She didn't tell me, it's her
birthday today?

979
01:12:16,065 --> 01:12:17,231
Buddy, did you see
she didn't tell him?

980
01:12:17,232 --> 01:12:20,232
Only donkeys like us go on tom tom
about our birthdays

981
01:12:20,903 --> 01:12:22,904
Women are decent
Will they do like that?

982
01:12:22,905 --> 01:12:25,905
She has said it, without saying!
Look! go straight to her!

983
01:12:27,076 --> 01:12:29,077
Before friends take her out!

984
01:12:29,078 --> 01:12:32,078
You take her out and surprize
her with a present –lt.'s good

985
01:12:41,590 --> 01:12:44,590
For my delay and your unhappiness

986
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:47,595
Can't you give me a chance
to rectify it?

987
01:12:47,596 --> 01:12:50,596
l've come to take you out
so, please come, let's go out

988
01:12:50,599 --> 01:12:52,600
We'll come back soon

989
01:12:52,601 --> 01:12:55,601
Please, don't say no!

990
01:12:59,108 --> 01:13:02,108
lndian traffic don't have
any discipline

991
01:13:04,279 --> 01:13:07,279
No...don't go overboard!

992
01:13:08,283 --> 01:13:11,283
AC chilling is good isn't it?

993
01:13:13,455 --> 01:13:16,455
Why don't you say something?

994
01:13:16,959 --> 01:13:18,459
Okay! tell me!

995
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:19,794
Where are we going?

996
01:13:19,795 --> 01:13:22,795
Why all this suspense?

997
01:13:23,966 --> 01:13:26,966
lf l don't like it, later
you'll feel bad about it

998
01:13:27,302 --> 01:13:30,302
You don't like it?! no way
you'll definitely like it

999
01:13:30,305 --> 01:13:33,305
Who had arranged it?
This gentleman only isn't it?

1000
01:13:36,145 --> 01:13:39,145
You fool! where did you find
this car!?

1001
01:13:46,321 --> 01:13:49,321
Sekhar! l'll not spare you!
l'll cut you into pieces

1002
01:13:51,493 --> 01:13:54,493
What's this? New method
to start a car?

1003
01:13:54,830 --> 01:13:57,165
No, we had fully switched on
AC isn't it?

1004
01:13:57,166 --> 01:14:00,166
So Diesel Pump got heated up and
valves got busted

1005
01:14:01,003 --> 01:14:03,337
Valves have to come from
Jamshedpur

1006
01:14:03,338 --> 01:14:06,007
lt'll come

1007
01:14:06,008 --> 01:14:09,008
Come, let's go in a Auto!

1008
01:14:12,681 --> 01:14:14,849
Why're you eating like that?

1009
01:14:14,850 --> 01:14:17,850
lt's delicious

1010
01:14:30,532 --> 01:14:33,532
l had arranged many things
everything has gone haywire

1011
01:14:34,203 --> 01:14:37,203
My time is running bad l had to
bring you to roadside push cart

1012
01:15:01,063 --> 01:15:03,231
Got late

1013
01:15:03,232 --> 01:15:06,232
No! still there are 5 minutes
to strike 12'0'clock

1014
01:15:29,424 --> 01:15:31,259
Are you surprized that
how did l come to know it?

1015
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:33,261
Why did you hide it from me?

1016
01:15:33,262 --> 01:15:34,929
You wanted to hide it from
me isn't it?

1017
01:15:34,930 --> 01:15:37,765
But, l came to know it from
your planner

1018
01:15:37,766 --> 01:15:40,766
Why l didn't say because?
it's not my birthday today

1019
01:15:41,436 --> 01:15:44,436
Today, it's my friend
Vasuki's birthday

1020
01:15:45,774 --> 01:15:48,774
Even this has failed
Sekhar! you're a dead man

1021
01:15:49,611 --> 01:15:50,611
No.. nothing

1022
01:15:50,612 --> 01:15:52,780
So, you did all this thinking
it was my birthday

1023
01:15:52,781 --> 01:15:54,615
lt's not like that

1024
01:15:54,616 --> 01:15:56,117
Okay! don't open it

1025
01:15:56,118 --> 01:15:59,118
Okay, let's do one thing! l'll buy
a gift to Vasuki on your birthday

1026
01:15:59,621 --> 01:16:02,621
Look, l don't have a heart to
take it back with me

1027
01:16:03,125 --> 01:16:06,125
So, l brought this for you only

1028
01:16:06,128 --> 01:16:09,128
Please take it, l didn't know
what to buy for you

1029
01:16:10,132 --> 01:16:13,132
l closed my eyes and thought
about you

1030
01:16:13,468 --> 01:16:16,468
l saw this!

1031
01:16:25,647 --> 01:16:28,647
lsn't it you?

1032
01:16:28,650 --> 01:16:30,818
When you're thinking, sitting
alone in one place

1033
01:16:30,819 --> 01:16:32,653
You'll be like this only, isn't it?

1034
01:16:32,654 --> 01:16:34,322
l closed my eyes...
thought about you...

1035
01:16:34,323 --> 01:16:37,323
l saw this....
...l bought it

1036
01:16:58,513 --> 01:17:01,015
This is you, isn't it?

1037
01:17:01,016 --> 01:17:03,184
When you're thinking, sitting
alone in a place

1038
01:17:03,185 --> 01:17:05,186
You'll be like this only, isn't it?

1039
01:17:05,187 --> 01:17:08,187
l closed my eyes and thought
l saw this, l bought it

1040
01:17:19,368 --> 01:17:21,869
l'm Rajeev speaking

1041
01:17:21,870 --> 01:17:24,870
We were discussing about
you only

1042
01:17:24,873 --> 01:17:27,375
We were waiting for your
phone call only

1043
01:17:27,376 --> 01:17:30,211
Mother! l'm coming

1044
01:17:30,212 --> 01:17:33,212
Mother! l'm trying for Reena's phone for
past 4 days with no success

1045
01:17:34,716 --> 01:17:37,051
l called her office, they
say she's on leave

1046
01:17:37,052 --> 01:17:38,719
Will you inform her?

1047
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:41,720
No mother, l had told her
that, l'll be coming

1048
01:17:43,225 --> 01:17:45,559
Now the programme is changed

1049
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:48,560
So, l'll come to Bangalore later, we'll
go together to Reena's place!

1050
01:17:51,566 --> 01:17:54,235
You'll inform Reena, isn't it?

1051
01:17:54,236 --> 01:17:56,070
We'll meet at Airport

1052
01:17:56,071 --> 01:17:56,904
Alright

1053
01:17:56,905 --> 01:17:59,905
Mother! you'll inform her without
fail, isn't it?

1054
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:19,493
Hey, why did you come here?

1055
01:18:19,494 --> 01:18:21,228
l should've questioned you

1056
01:18:21,229 --> 01:18:24,229
You said that you'll spend time with
me for 5 days

1057
01:18:24,566 --> 01:18:25,800
But, why have you come to
the office?

1058
01:18:25,801 --> 01:18:27,301
No! 
–lt.'s not correct

1059
01:18:27,302 --> 01:18:30,302
l have some work, which
l can't avoid

1060
01:18:31,206 --> 01:18:32,573
lt's only for 2 hours

1061
01:18:32,574 --> 01:18:35,574
You go, l'll meet M.D. & come

1062
01:18:35,610 --> 01:18:38,610
Till then, what do you want
me to do?

1063
01:18:39,147 --> 01:18:40,548
Don't do anything

1064
01:18:40,549 --> 01:18:43,549
Go & sit in the corner
like a good boy

1065
01:18:46,021 --> 01:18:47,188
l can't do that

1066
01:18:47,189 --> 01:18:50,189
Hello, who's M.D. here?

1067
01:18:51,126 --> 01:18:54,126
Then what?

1068
01:18:54,930 --> 01:18:57,732
l thought of spending time
romancing you

1069
01:18:57,733 --> 01:18:58,666
But, you've made me to sit
in the office

1070
01:18:58,667 --> 01:18:59,700
What kind of office is this?

1071
01:18:59,701 --> 01:19:02,701
lt's like the colour of
State Transport bus

1072
01:19:03,739 --> 01:19:06,739
That's good!
–Alright

1073
01:19:10,045 --> 01:19:13,045
Hey, whose file is this?
–Keep quiet

1074
01:19:16,785 --> 01:19:19,785
lt's for you

1075
01:19:22,390 --> 01:19:24,625
What's it?

1076
01:19:24,626 --> 01:19:27,528
No, the phone is out of order at home.
–l know it

1077
01:19:27,529 --> 01:19:30,529
l didn't even come to the office
–who's it?...who's it?...

1078
01:19:30,932 --> 01:19:33,932
Your father

1079
01:19:36,004 --> 01:19:39,004
No Rajeev! Put it down
No, Rajeev

1080
01:19:40,175 --> 01:19:42,343
What do you mean by that?

1081
01:19:42,344 --> 01:19:44,345
He spoke with me 40 minutes earlier

1082
01:19:44,346 --> 01:19:45,679
l also told him that
l'm going to meet you

1083
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:47,348
Why is he calling again?

1084
01:19:47,349 --> 01:19:48,516
You.... 
–Okay

1085
01:19:48,517 --> 01:19:50,518
Okay, What l did was wrong?

1086
01:19:50,519 --> 01:19:52,019
What had happened to you?

1087
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:53,854
lt won't even take 3 minutes
to talk to him

1088
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:55,689
You're behaving as if, the whole
world is sinking

1089
01:19:55,690 --> 01:19:58,690
Yes, My world is sinking

1090
01:20:00,862 --> 01:20:02,696
Don't you understand?

1091
01:20:02,697 --> 01:20:04,532
Reena, look at me

1092
01:20:04,533 --> 01:20:07,034
l can't even waste a single minute

1093
01:20:07,035 --> 01:20:09,537
l want to talk to you

1094
01:20:09,538 --> 01:20:12,538
l want to hold your hands
That's all!

1095
01:20:13,708 --> 01:20:15,376
What do you want me to do?

1096
01:20:15,377 --> 01:20:16,710
Okay, Listen

1097
01:20:16,711 --> 01:20:18,546
There's a special place

1098
01:20:18,547 --> 01:20:21,547
l'll take you there
will you come?

1099
01:20:22,384 --> 01:20:24,051
Hey, What's this?

1100
01:20:24,052 --> 01:20:27,052
You've brought me here
–l'll tell you

1101
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:34,560
Slowly...Slowly...

1102
01:20:46,408 --> 01:20:49,408
Such a beautiful place in our city?

1103
01:20:57,419 --> 01:21:00,419
Rajeev, l'm not able to believe

1104
01:21:00,755 --> 01:21:03,090
l like it very much

1105
01:21:03,091 --> 01:21:04,758
l know

1106
01:21:04,759 --> 01:21:07,759
You know about me & this
place very well

1107
01:21:08,430 --> 01:21:11,430
But, l don't know about you like

1108
01:21:13,768 --> 01:21:16,768
lt's easy to read me

1109
01:21:27,115 --> 01:21:30,115
l'll tell you about a matter
but, it's a secret

1110
01:21:30,952 --> 01:21:32,453
What's it? 
–l'll tell you

1111
01:21:32,454 --> 01:21:34,121
But, before that, you must tell
me a secret

1112
01:21:34,122 --> 01:21:36,790
A secret which no one is aware of

1113
01:21:36,791 --> 01:21:38,626
Nothing like that

1114
01:21:38,627 --> 01:21:41,462
lt's impossible, A girl without
a secret

1115
01:21:41,463 --> 01:21:44,463
Okay, tell me! 
–lt's true There's nothing

1116
01:21:47,469 --> 01:21:50,469
Shall l tell my secrets?

1117
01:21:50,472 --> 01:21:53,472
A girl in the lightning light

1118
01:21:54,142 --> 01:21:57,142
Even, she is like a lightning

1119
01:22:00,815 --> 01:22:03,651
l lost my heart

1120
01:22:03,652 --> 01:22:06,652
Only my life is remaining

1121
01:22:09,324 --> 01:22:12,324
l think, l'm in love with her

1122
01:22:23,505 --> 01:22:25,506
She's my friend Arthi

1123
01:22:25,507 --> 01:22:27,341
This is Sukanya

1124
01:22:27,342 --> 01:22:29,843
This is...
–Vasuki!

1125
01:22:29,844 --> 01:22:32,844
How do you know?

1126
01:22:33,848 --> 01:22:34,682
You keep telling me that...

1127
01:22:34,683 --> 01:22:37,683
You've some close friends
and this is her, isn't it?

1128
01:22:40,855 --> 01:22:43,855
We are a big gang

1129
01:22:44,192 --> 01:22:45,526
She's my mother 
–Greetings

1130
01:22:45,527 --> 01:22:48,527
Hey, This was taken at the time
of my convocation

1131
01:22:51,366 --> 01:22:54,366
Do you know?
l stood 1st in the University

1132
01:22:54,536 --> 01:22:57,536
This was taken at the time of
modelling for an Advertisement

1133
01:22:59,374 --> 01:23:00,708
l can't see anything

1134
01:23:00,709 --> 01:23:02,710
Everything seems to be out of focus

1135
01:23:02,711 --> 01:23:05,711
Why? –Because, you're sitting
close to me, isn't it?

1136
01:23:17,058 --> 01:23:18,058
Power failure

1137
01:23:18,059 --> 01:23:21,059
You've a lighter with you?
Do you smoke?

1138
01:23:21,896 --> 01:23:23,564
Do l look like a smoker to you?

1139
01:23:23,565 --> 01:23:25,899
l've kept it for an emergency

1140
01:23:25,900 --> 01:23:28,900
Look here, l'll be here till
the power is restored

1141
01:23:35,243 --> 01:23:37,578
Actually, we don't need
these candles

1142
01:23:37,579 --> 01:23:40,579
Do you want me to sit in the dark?
–Not in the dark...

1143
01:23:41,583 --> 01:23:43,584
Light's on, when you laugh

1144
01:23:43,585 --> 01:23:46,585
Oh No! My eyes are dazzled

1145
01:23:48,923 --> 01:23:51,923
Don't you feel anything?
–What should l feel?

1146
01:23:51,926 --> 01:23:54,595
lt is....

1147
01:23:54,596 --> 01:23:57,596
There's no power too

1148
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:00,934
And an ordinary looking girl

1149
01:24:00,935 --> 01:24:03,270
With a handsome boy

1150
01:24:03,271 --> 01:24:04,271
Really! Don't you feel anything?

1151
01:24:04,272 --> 01:24:07,272
Hey, keep these things for
America, not here

1152
01:24:07,609 --> 01:24:10,609
Are you a handsome boy?
ls it a joke?

1153
01:24:11,613 --> 01:24:14,613
Do you know, how popular l'm
with girls?

1154
01:24:16,284 --> 01:24:18,952
But, l don't feel like that

1155
01:24:18,953 --> 01:24:21,953
l was talking about beautiful girls

1156
01:24:26,795 --> 01:24:29,463
Don't think that, l'm posing as a
palmist, to hold your hand

1157
01:24:29,464 --> 01:24:32,464
l really know palmistry

1158
01:24:37,138 --> 01:24:40,138
Oh God! l can't believe it

1159
01:24:40,975 --> 01:24:43,811
What's it? 
–lt.'s very shocking

1160
01:24:43,812 --> 01:24:46,812
lt's okay, tell me

1161
01:24:47,315 --> 01:24:50,315
According to this, you'll not settle
down in America

1162
01:24:51,986 --> 01:24:53,654
What are you talking?
–Look here

1163
01:24:53,655 --> 01:24:56,490
There are no runway lines at all

1164
01:24:56,491 --> 01:24:58,826
There are many railway tracks

1165
01:24:58,827 --> 01:25:00,494
They're very clear

1166
01:25:00,495 --> 01:25:03,495
This is Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh!
This is Andhra Pradesh

1167
01:25:06,167 --> 01:25:08,836
l know that you're going to
settle here only

1168
01:25:08,837 --> 01:25:11,505
l'm not saying this
your palm tells that

1169
01:25:11,506 --> 01:25:14,506
Not only that...
another important matter

1170
01:25:16,344 --> 01:25:18,679
The boy who's going to marry you
will be a Telugu Brahmin

1171
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:21,515
A Telugu Brahmin?
–Yes, a Telugu Brahmin

1172
01:25:21,516 --> 01:25:22,516
Can't you understand?

1173
01:25:22,517 --> 01:25:25,185
Those who don't eat chicken
mutton in their houses..

1174
01:25:25,186 --> 01:25:28,186
...But eat in Hotels

1175
01:25:29,190 --> 01:25:30,858
l'm telling you the truth

1176
01:25:30,859 --> 01:25:33,193
Whatever it may be, you'll
lead a wonderful life

1177
01:25:33,194 --> 01:25:36,194
That's sure

1178
01:25:36,698 --> 01:25:39,698
lt's not me, who's telling this
it's your palm

1179
01:31:29,717 --> 01:31:32,219
Hey, l can't wait anymore

1180
01:31:32,220 --> 01:31:34,054
Tell me, whether you like me or not?

1181
01:31:34,055 --> 01:31:37,055
l'm still confused about you

1182
01:31:39,060 --> 01:31:41,061
Okay, no need, l'll help you

1183
01:31:41,062 --> 01:31:42,729
l'll do it in my way

1184
01:31:42,730 --> 01:31:45,730
Close your eyes for 10 seconds

1185
01:31:46,234 --> 01:31:49,234
Tell me, whether l'm in your
heart or not?

1186
01:32:04,252 --> 01:32:06,753
Am l in your heart?

1187
01:32:06,754 --> 01:32:08,755
l'll go mad, tell me

1188
01:32:08,756 --> 01:32:10,924

l'll tell you later

1215
01:40:40,434 --> 01:40:41,701

Are they nice?

1220
01:41:09,129 --> 01:41:10,129
lt's not my selection

1221
01:41:10,130 --> 01:41:12,298
Rajeev's mother had presented to you

1222
01:41:12,299 --> 01:41:15,134
Do you like it?

1223
01:41:15,135 --> 01:41:18,135
Did you speak to Rajeev?

1224
01:41:19,807 --> 01:41:22,807
l'm asking you only
Did you talk to Rajeev?

1225
01:41:23,310 --> 01:41:26,310
Your father will be very happy
if you get married

1226
01:41:26,647 --> 01:41:29,482
You know, he's been talking about
this marriage for so many years

1227
01:41:29,483 --> 01:41:31,818
l'm here

1228
01:41:31,819 --> 01:41:34,819
What's this? you both are talking, as if
you have come for a picnic

1229
01:41:34,988 --> 01:41:35,988
Did we come here from
Bangalore for this?

1230
01:41:35,989 --> 01:41:36,989
We're going to see the groom

1231
01:41:36,990 --> 01:41:39,990
l told that, l'll be coming by 1 1'0
clock to Rajeev's family

1232
01:41:43,497 --> 01:41:45,498
Hey! you tell me

1233
01:41:45,499 --> 01:41:48,334
No one will believe that
Reena is your daughter

1234
01:41:48,335 --> 01:41:50,002
How beautiful she is!

1235
01:41:50,003 --> 01:41:53,003
Hey you! your son won't
talk like you, isn't it?

1236
01:41:53,841 --> 01:41:56,676
Then, it's okay

1237
01:41:56,677 --> 01:41:57,677
There's nothing like that

1238
01:41:57,678 --> 01:42:00,678
He's very calm like Shyam's mother

1239
01:42:04,017 --> 01:42:06,853
He had telephoned Reena 10 times

1240
01:42:06,854 --> 01:42:09,689
l know very well that he
likes Reena very much

1241
01:42:09,690 --> 01:42:12,191
Because of that, l had sent her photo

1242
01:42:12,192 --> 01:42:15,192
Okay, where's Rajeev?
Can't find him at all

1243
01:42:15,863 --> 01:42:18,197
Still, he hasn't adjusted to
lndian time

1244
01:42:18,198 --> 01:42:20,366
He got up now only & went to bathe

1245
01:42:20,367 --> 01:42:23,035
Tomorrow, he'll be conducting
personal interviews in Bangalore

1246
01:42:23,036 --> 01:42:24,871
lt's a software body shopping

1247
01:42:24,872 --> 01:42:26,873
He's going to select 25 people

1248
01:42:26,874 --> 01:42:29,208
We're leaving tonight itself

1249
01:42:29,209 --> 01:42:32,209
Okay, why don't we take Reena with
us to Bangalore?

1250
01:42:32,713 --> 01:42:35,214
We'll enjoy for 2–3 days

1251
01:42:35,215 --> 01:42:38,050
Let Rajeev & Reena come closer

1252
01:42:38,051 --> 01:42:40,553
Engagement will be there
marriage will be here

1253
01:42:40,554 --> 01:42:43,554
Relatives of both the families are
here only, isn't it

1254
01:42:43,891 --> 01:42:46,891
Okay, l agree my daughter has
agreed for the marriage

1255
01:42:47,227 --> 01:42:49,562
Your son must agree

1256
01:42:49,563 --> 01:42:51,564
Where's he?
Ask him to come fast?

1257
01:42:51,565 --> 01:42:54,066
l think, he's attending a call

1258
01:42:54,067 --> 01:42:57,067
Take it, my wife prepared it herself
–l'll get him

1259
01:43:14,588 --> 01:43:17,588
Look, he's coming

1260
01:43:18,091 --> 01:43:21,091
He has grown up very fast

1261
01:43:40,948 --> 01:43:43,948
We'll sit & talk

1262
01:43:47,621 --> 01:43:50,456
Yes....yes....

1263
01:43:50,457 --> 01:43:53,457
Let them talk...
–Talk to her....

1264
01:43:55,462 --> 01:43:57,964
l forgot to ask you, why didn't
you call me again?

1265
01:43:57,965 --> 01:43:59,966
What happened? ls the phone
out of order?

1266
01:43:59,967 --> 01:44:02,967
l was continuously trying but
l couldn't get the line

1267
01:44:06,807 --> 01:44:09,475
Have it

1268
01:44:09,476 --> 01:44:12,311
Give them sweets
–Have it

1269
01:44:12,312 --> 01:44:14,146
Do you remember, what l had told you?

1270
01:44:14,147 --> 01:44:15,982
We've a big society behind us

1271
01:44:15,983 --> 01:44:18,983
Look, a big conference is going on

1272
01:44:19,319 --> 01:44:22,319
l'm thinking of taking
you to Bangalore

1273
01:44:26,660 --> 01:44:29,495
Will you be able to take any leave?

1274
01:44:29,496 --> 01:44:32,496
We had already discussed
about this on phone?

1275
01:44:34,001 --> 01:44:36,502
What was he looking like?

1276
01:44:36,503 --> 01:44:39,005
....About him?

1277
01:44:39,006 --> 01:44:42,006
He's very tall, always smiling

1278
01:44:45,679 --> 01:44:48,514
Everything was a foul play

1279
01:44:48,515 --> 01:44:50,182
Now, is this very important Vasuki?

1280
01:44:50,183 --> 01:44:52,518
No, l asked you because....

1281
01:44:52,519 --> 01:44:55,519
10 days back, 2 persons came to me
& enquired about you

1282
01:44:57,858 --> 01:45:00,858
They are Rajesh & Sekhar

1283
01:45:05,032 --> 01:45:07,199
l gave your phone number to them

1284
01:45:07,200 --> 01:45:07,867
Did you give them?

1285
01:45:07,868 --> 01:45:09,869
No..they said, they know you very well

1286
01:45:09,870 --> 01:45:12,038
But, l gave them only the phone number...

1287
01:45:12,039 --> 01:45:14,707
How did they know about Rajeev?

1288
01:45:14,708 --> 01:45:17,043
We've to take it seriously

1289
01:45:17,044 --> 01:45:18,711
He has deceived you

1290
01:45:18,712 --> 01:45:21,547
They'll get caught, if we
lodge a complaint

1291
01:45:21,548 --> 01:45:23,049
Go & tell your Father about this

1292
01:45:23,050 --> 01:45:25,551
l had roamed with that fraud
for 5 days

1293
01:45:25,552 --> 01:45:28,220
We had laughed together

1294
01:45:28,221 --> 01:45:31,221
Then, l had asked him
when will he marry me?

1295
01:45:36,897 --> 01:45:38,731
Do you want me to tell these
things to my father?

1296
01:45:38,732 --> 01:45:41,732
Did he misbehave with you?

1297
01:45:42,069 --> 01:45:44,737
Won't you call this a misbehaviour?

1298
01:45:44,738 --> 01:45:47,738
He told lies & deceived me

1299
01:45:50,077 --> 01:45:52,745
Everything was wrong?

1300
01:45:52,746 --> 01:45:55,746
But, why did he deceive me?

1301
01:45:56,416 --> 01:45:59,416
Why did he lie to me?

1302
01:45:59,419 --> 01:46:02,419
Why did he impersonate?

1303
01:46:17,804 --> 01:46:20,804
l'm scared after reaching here

1304
01:46:22,142 --> 01:46:25,142
Will she believe me, that l lied
to her, only for her

1305
01:46:27,147 --> 01:46:28,147
You were bold while telling lies....

1306
01:46:28,148 --> 01:46:29,315
...But, why are you scared to
tell the truth?

1307
01:46:29,316 --> 01:46:31,484
Go, she'll definitely believe you

1308
01:46:31,485 --> 01:46:33,652
100% sure, go....

1309
01:46:33,653 --> 01:46:36,653
Okay, you go
–Okay, l'll go...you get in

1310
01:46:56,176 --> 01:46:58,344
Why did you come?

1311
01:46:58,345 --> 01:47:01,180
Whom do you want to deceive now?

1312
01:47:01,181 --> 01:47:03,682
Reena has come to know about everything

1313
01:47:03,683 --> 01:47:06,683
How could you behave like this?

1314
01:47:08,522 --> 01:47:10,523
l want to talk to Reena, please....

1315
01:47:10,524 --> 01:47:13,524
But, Reena won't talk to you

1316
01:47:14,861 --> 01:47:16,362
What do you want?

1317
01:47:16,363 --> 01:47:18,030
l want to talk to you

1318
01:47:18,031 --> 01:47:20,366
Vasuki, ask him to go

1319
01:47:20,367 --> 01:47:23,367
l don't want to talk to anyone

1320
01:47:25,205 --> 01:47:28,040
Who're you? What's your name?

1321
01:47:28,041 --> 01:47:31,041
Please Reena, listen to me

1322
01:47:35,715 --> 01:47:38,715
l came here to tell you the truth

1323
01:47:39,886 --> 01:47:42,886
But, you already know, haven't
l made myself clear?

1324
01:47:42,889 --> 01:47:45,224
Why should l talk to you?

1325
01:47:45,225 --> 01:47:46,725
Will you be quiet?

1326
01:47:46,726 --> 01:47:49,726
Rajesh, please leave without
creating new problems

1327
01:47:50,230 --> 01:47:51,564
Please wait, Vasuki

1328
01:47:51,565 --> 01:47:53,232
Let me talk, please

1329
01:47:53,233 --> 01:47:56,233
The problem is between us

1330
01:48:00,240 --> 01:48:02,908
Vasuki, call Uncle....

1331
01:48:02,909 --> 01:48:04,410
Listen to me....

1332
01:48:04,411 --> 01:48:07,411
Reena, listen to me...

1333
01:48:08,248 --> 01:48:08,914
Look here

1334
01:48:08,915 --> 01:48:11,915
Whom do you want to deceive
with these...

1335
01:48:16,423 --> 01:48:18,924
Reena, what happened?

1336
01:48:18,925 --> 01:48:20,926
Who are you?
–Mind your business

1337
01:48:20,927 --> 01:48:23,095
What do you want?
What're you doing here?

1338
01:48:23,096 --> 01:48:25,431
Are you misbehaving with
a lonely girl?

1339
01:48:25,432 --> 01:48:28,432
Mind your business....

1340
01:48:35,108 --> 01:48:38,108
Ravi, don't come here

1341
01:48:42,616 --> 01:48:45,616
Why are you still standing here?
Get lost

1342
01:48:53,627 --> 01:48:56,627
Vasuki & Ravi come inside

1343
01:49:06,139 --> 01:49:09,139
Are you Ravi?

1344
01:49:13,813 --> 01:49:16,813
Are you the neighbour of
Reena Joseph?

1345
01:49:17,984 --> 01:49:19,485
Are you acting too smart?

1346
01:49:19,486 --> 01:49:21,153
Did you hit my friend?

1347
01:49:21,154 --> 01:49:24,154
Do you love her?

1348
01:49:27,994 --> 01:49:30,994
Love? l'm going to marry her

1349
01:49:47,447 --> 01:49:50,447
Hit him

1350
01:49:53,186 --> 01:49:56,186
What did you say?

1351
01:49:56,356 --> 01:49:59,356
What did you say?

1352
01:50:02,862 --> 01:50:05,862
Are you going to marry Reena?

1353
01:52:27,340 --> 01:52:29,341
l want to say sorry!

1354
01:52:29,342 --> 01:52:31,343
l don't know whether you
remember or not...

1355
01:52:31,344 --> 01:52:34,344
During my aunty's marriage
in Bangalore...

1356
01:52:34,514 --> 01:52:37,349
l pushed you in to a room
switched off the lights

1357
01:52:37,350 --> 01:52:39,017
Locked the doors & went away

1358
01:52:39,018 --> 01:52:41,687
And you got scared and
started crying

1359
01:52:41,688 --> 01:52:43,689
Even my father scolded me

1360
01:52:43,690 --> 01:52:45,190
l came to apologize

1361
01:52:45,191 --> 01:52:48,191
But, you had left before
l could reach there

1362
01:52:51,364 --> 01:52:53,699
The pardon which was to be
sought at that time

1363
01:52:53,700 --> 01:52:56,700
l'm seeking now, after
so many years

1364
01:52:59,038 --> 01:53:00,873
When my mother sent your
snap to me...

1365
01:53:00,874 --> 01:53:03,041
l felt very happy

1366
01:53:03,042 --> 01:53:06,042
But, when l'm meeting you
in person...

1367
01:53:06,546 --> 01:53:09,546
l've become speechless

1368
01:53:10,550 --> 01:53:13,218
l can't forget these 3 days

1369
01:53:13,219 --> 01:53:16,219
But, l won't claim that l've understood
you well in these 3 days

1370
01:53:18,224 --> 01:53:20,893
lf l say that then, it's a lie

1371
01:53:20,894 --> 01:53:23,562
You need an entire life for that

1372
01:53:23,563 --> 01:53:26,563
But, if you're with me all my life
l'll be very happy

1373
01:53:28,067 --> 01:53:31,067
l can assure you that

1374
01:53:32,906 --> 01:53:35,906
l'm feeling proud that, you're
going to be my wife

1375
01:53:44,417 --> 01:53:47,417
Hey, pick it up...pick it up...

1376
01:53:49,589 --> 01:53:52,090
Ask Rajesh not to call Reena again?
–Why?

1377
01:53:52,091 --> 01:53:53,592
Reena will not talk to him

1378
01:53:53,593 --> 01:53:55,093
Rajeev is here only

1379
01:53:55,094 --> 01:53:57,763
isn't it?

1380
01:53:57,764 --> 01:53:58,931
What do you want me to talk?

1381
01:53:58,932 --> 01:54:00,599
You are making mistakes
one after the another

1382
01:54:00,600 --> 01:54:01,934
You've also beaten our
neighbour Ravi

1383
01:54:01,935 --> 01:54:04,935
Do you know, why?
–There's nothing, l can do

1384
01:54:05,605 --> 01:54:08,605
Ask Rajesh to forget Reena?

1385
01:54:09,442 --> 01:54:11,109
Hey, what did she say?

1386
01:54:11,110 --> 01:54:12,611
What's she going to say?

1387
01:54:12,612 --> 01:54:14,079
She's saying, what Reena told her

1388
01:54:14,080 --> 01:54:17,080
Look here, forget what she &
Subbuni had said

1389
01:54:17,417 --> 01:54:20,085
Our headache is that American person

1390
01:54:20,086 --> 01:54:22,087
Only because of him, you are
in problems & dilemma

1391
01:54:22,088 --> 01:54:23,922
We'll directly go to him
we'll talk to him

1392
01:54:23,923 --> 01:54:26,923
lt's okay, if he listens or else
we'll throw him out

1393
01:54:32,565 --> 01:54:33,565
Sir, who are you?

1394
01:54:33,566 --> 01:54:34,399
What do you want?

1395
01:54:34,400 --> 01:54:35,400
Where's 5E? lt's there

1396
01:54:35,401 --> 01:54:37,302
What's the matter?
–Hey! get lost

1397
01:54:37,303 --> 01:54:40,303
Come

1398
01:55:10,003 --> 01:55:11,503
Can't you open the door & get in?

1399
01:55:11,504 --> 01:55:13,338
Hey, who's that, who has come
from America?

1400
01:55:13,339 --> 01:55:15,340
Who's that?

1401
01:55:15,341 --> 01:55:17,175
Come out

1402
01:55:17,176 --> 01:55:19,011
Come out, you coward!

1403
01:55:19,012 --> 01:55:22,012
Where are you hiding?
come out!

1404
01:55:23,349 --> 01:55:24,683
Will you get your sister
married to me?

1405
01:55:24,684 --> 01:55:26,685
l should've asked that question to you

1406
01:55:26,686 --> 01:55:27,686
First tell me, who are you?

1407
01:55:27,687 --> 01:55:30,355
ls it you, who had come from America?
Hey, what's his name?

1408
01:55:30,356 --> 01:55:33,356
Are you Rajeev?
Tell me

1409
01:55:41,367 --> 01:55:44,202
Rogue!

1410
01:55:44,203 --> 01:55:46,204
Oh! you are the one...

1411
01:55:46,205 --> 01:55:49,205
The American person is very handsome

1412
01:55:49,709 --> 01:55:51,543
Look here

1413
01:55:51,544 --> 01:55:54,544
We've come here to tell you an
important matter

1414
01:55:54,881 --> 01:55:56,381
What's that? ls it a
double bedroom?

1415
01:55:56,382 --> 01:55:57,883
lt has also got an attached bathroom

1416
01:55:57,884 --> 01:55:58,884
Shall we go & talk over there?

1417
01:55:58,885 --> 01:56:00,052
Will you switch on the A/C
or shall we go out?

1418
01:56:00,053 --> 01:56:02,220
Tell me, what do you prefer?

1419
01:56:02,221 --> 01:56:03,221
Wait

1420
01:56:03,222 --> 01:56:04,723
l'm asking him, isn't it

1421
01:56:04,724 --> 01:56:07,392
Are you dumb from your birth?

1422
01:56:07,393 --> 01:56:09,394
Hey, what's it?

1423
01:56:09,395 --> 01:56:10,729
We came here to bash him, isn't it

1424
01:56:10,730 --> 01:56:13,730
You keep watching..

1425
01:56:21,908 --> 01:56:24,908
He's our old enemy, isn't it?

1426
01:56:24,911 --> 01:56:26,578
lt's a re–entry

1427
01:56:26,579 --> 01:56:29,579
Then, it has become very easy
to throw him out

1428
01:56:29,582 --> 01:56:30,749
Why did you come to my house?

1429
01:56:30,750 --> 01:56:33,750
To modify your building
–Shut up!

1430
01:56:34,420 --> 01:56:36,922
We came here to talk to a person

1431
01:56:36,923 --> 01:56:38,590
But, after knowing it's you...

1432
01:56:38,591 --> 01:56:40,092
l feel there is no use of
talking to you

1433
01:56:40,093 --> 01:56:43,093
Hey, what's there to talk to him?

1434
01:56:43,096 --> 01:56:44,930
Look here, American! Listen to me

1435
01:56:44,931 --> 01:56:47,599
You dreamed of marrying a girl
isn't it?

1436
01:56:47,600 --> 01:56:48,934
That's only a dream

1437
01:56:48,935 --> 01:56:50,268
She's your Sister–in–law

1438
01:56:50,269 --> 01:56:52,104
Because, he's your elder brother

1439
01:56:52,105 --> 01:56:54,606
Did you understand? Come on let's go
–Wait

1440
01:56:54,607 --> 01:56:57,607
This is not the game which we had
played in the college

1441
01:57:07,453 --> 01:57:10,453
l love her

1442
01:57:12,458 --> 01:57:14,292
Even she loves me

1443
01:57:14,293 --> 01:57:17,293
There's a problem between us
because of your intrusion

1444
01:57:17,630 --> 01:57:20,630
Hey, you've got Dollars
and Green Card

1445
01:57:21,467 --> 01:57:23,635
Don't think that, she'll be
flattered with that

1446
01:57:23,636 --> 01:57:26,304
Pack up & leave now itself

1447
01:57:26,305 --> 01:57:29,305
That'll be good for us

1448
01:57:31,144 --> 01:57:34,144
You know that, l'll tell only once

1449
01:57:36,983 --> 01:57:39,983
Hey, Look! Horlicks Uncle &
Soap Aunty have come

1450
01:57:41,154 --> 01:57:44,154
You're hit by bad time always

1451
01:57:44,390 --> 01:57:45,891
lt's going to hit us
if we come with you

1452
01:57:45,892 --> 01:57:46,725
Hereafter, we won't come

1453
01:57:46,726 --> 01:57:49,394
Hey, l'll break your teeth

1454
01:57:49,395 --> 01:57:50,729
Hey, you all went there

1455
01:57:50,730 --> 01:57:52,898
You could've at least hit him

1456
01:57:52,899 --> 01:57:54,900
Look at the advice, he's giving

1457
01:57:54,901 --> 01:57:56,068
We thought of doing that

1458
01:57:56,069 --> 01:57:57,569
But, he didn't allow us

1459
01:57:57,570 --> 01:57:59,738
l'll break your limbs

1460
01:57:59,739 --> 01:58:02,739
Did you tell the American boy
that you are in love with her

1461
01:58:03,743 --> 01:58:05,911
We shouted to that extent that
the whole street would've heard

1462
01:58:05,912 --> 01:58:08,246
How'll he marry after telling that?

1463
01:58:08,247 --> 01:58:10,148
Won't he pack up & leave immediately

1464
01:58:10,149 --> 01:58:11,416
No Subbuni!

1465
01:58:11,417 --> 01:58:13,652
l know about Samuel very well

1466
01:58:13,653 --> 01:58:16,653
Since it's me, he'll not
compromise so easily

1467
01:58:27,366 --> 01:58:29,201
l had talked to my Father

1468
01:58:29,202 --> 01:58:31,036
He said, Church is okay

1469
01:58:31,037 --> 01:58:34,037
He's very happy

1470
01:58:37,877 --> 01:58:40,877
l've come for a clarification

1471
01:58:43,382 --> 01:58:46,382
Do you know, Rajesh?

1472
01:58:48,054 --> 01:58:50,889
He was my Collegemate

1473
01:58:50,890 --> 01:58:53,890
We keep fighting always

1474
01:58:55,061 --> 01:58:56,728
He said, he loves you

1475
01:58:56,729 --> 01:58:58,396
He also said that even you're
in love with him

1476
01:58:58,397 --> 01:59:01,066
l know that's not true

1477
01:59:01,067 --> 01:59:04,067
l only came to enquire about it

1478
01:59:04,737 --> 01:59:07,572
l know him only for 5 days

1479
01:59:07,573 --> 01:59:08,907
Yes!

1480
01:59:08,908 --> 01:59:11,908
He came to my house as Rajeev
from America

1481
01:59:13,246 --> 01:59:16,246
Thinking that, he was you
l talked to him

1482
01:59:16,249 --> 01:59:19,249
And closely moved with him

1483
01:59:21,921 --> 01:59:24,921
When l came to know, that
it isn't true...

1484
01:59:24,924 --> 01:59:27,924
From the moment, l had stopped
talking to him

1485
01:59:27,927 --> 01:59:30,927
After that, he tried to
meet me twice

1486
01:59:32,265 --> 01:59:34,432
l avoided him

1487
01:59:34,433 --> 01:59:37,433
Did he come to you impersonating me?

1488
01:59:37,603 --> 01:59:40,603
But, how did he know that
l'm coming... we both....

1489
01:59:43,276 --> 01:59:46,276
Don't make this a big issue

1490
01:59:46,946 --> 01:59:49,946
l don't want to talk about him

1491
01:59:54,453 --> 01:59:56,955
Do you know, what he told me?

1492
01:59:56,956 --> 01:59:59,956
He asked me to pack up
& leave the place

1493
02:00:00,126 --> 02:00:02,627
Can Rajesh become Rajeev?

1494
02:00:02,628 --> 02:00:05,130
lt can never happen

1495
02:00:05,131 --> 02:00:08,131
Hereafter, he won't disturb you

1496
02:00:24,984 --> 02:00:27,984
Are you Rajeev?

1497
02:00:28,487 --> 02:00:30,822
Have you been to America?

1498
02:00:30,823 --> 02:00:33,658
At least, have you seen it on a Map?

1499
02:00:33,659 --> 02:00:35,994
Now, it has been proved
that you are a localite

1500
02:00:35,995 --> 02:00:37,329
Stop....stop...

1501
02:00:37,330 --> 02:00:40,330
What's it?

1502
02:00:40,333 --> 02:00:43,168
We used to fight in College

1503
02:00:43,169 --> 02:00:45,670
Now, we're fighting to real life too

1504
02:00:45,671 --> 02:00:48,671
There won't be any fight or
blood shed from my side

1505
02:00:51,177 --> 02:00:54,177
l know, where to hit you

1506
02:00:57,350 --> 02:01:00,350
This Sunday.... me...

1507
02:01:02,188 --> 02:01:04,522
The first invitation is for you

1508
02:01:04,523 --> 02:01:06,358
Why is it?

1509
02:01:06,359 --> 02:01:09,359
Since, you're my elder brother
isn't it?

1510
02:01:09,362 --> 02:01:12,362
No one should come

1511
02:01:15,034 --> 02:01:18,034
What's this? Get lost

1512
02:01:22,375 --> 02:01:25,375
Hey, tear & throw it

1513
02:01:26,379 --> 02:01:29,379
Come, let's go

1514
02:01:46,565 --> 02:01:49,565
l want to talk to you

1515
02:01:50,569 --> 02:01:53,569
l'm not interested to talk to you

1516
02:01:53,739 --> 02:01:56,074
Please, get out from here

1517
02:01:56,075 --> 02:01:57,742
Reena, listen to me...

1518
02:01:57,743 --> 02:01:58,743
Please, allow me to talk

1519
02:01:58,744 --> 02:02:00,078
Please, wait for a minute

1520
02:02:00,079 --> 02:02:00,912
Look here, Whatever l've
done is wrong

1521
02:02:00,913 --> 02:02:02,247
l accept

1522
02:02:02,248 --> 02:02:05,248
l shouldn't have lied to you

1523
02:02:05,584 --> 02:02:08,584
But at that time, l never felt that
l was committing a mistake

1524
02:02:09,255 --> 02:02:11,756
l had no other choice

1525
02:02:11,757 --> 02:02:14,757
l only desired to talk & be
friendly with you, that's all

1526
02:02:17,596 --> 02:02:20,596
For which, l've already said sorry

1527
02:02:29,608 --> 02:02:32,608
Only one minute

1528
02:02:40,286 --> 02:02:41,453
Please, stop for one minute

1529
02:02:41,454 --> 02:02:42,620
Kindly listen to me

1530
02:02:42,621 --> 02:02:45,290
First time, l saw you in Bangalore
in lightning & rain

1531
02:02:45,291 --> 02:02:48,126
Later, l saw you in Rakesh's marriage

1532
02:02:48,127 --> 02:02:51,127
After that when l saw you here..

1533
02:02:54,467 --> 02:02:57,467
l met Vasuki and collected
your details

1534
02:02:57,636 --> 02:02:59,804
l followed you wherever you went

1535
02:02:59,805 --> 02:03:02,474
l desired to stay always with you

1536
02:03:02,475 --> 02:03:03,975
l got that chance

1537
02:03:03,976 --> 02:03:06,976
l came to know that one Mr.Rajeev
was coming to meet you

1538
02:03:07,146 --> 02:03:08,646
So, l came as Rajeev to your house

1539
02:03:08,647 --> 02:03:11,483
But, l didn't have any intention
of deceiving you

1540
02:03:11,484 --> 02:03:14,484
l wanted only your love
...that's all

1541
02:03:16,655 --> 02:03:19,655
l never cheated you
even in my dreams

1542
02:03:19,992 --> 02:03:21,393
When you said that you too like me...

1543
02:03:21,394 --> 02:03:22,394
l thought of telling you the truth

1544
02:03:22,395 --> 02:03:24,829
But before that, you came to
know about everything

1545
02:03:24,830 --> 02:03:27,830
Hey! what was my mistake?

1546
02:03:28,134 --> 02:03:30,935
You had roamed with me for 5 days

1547
02:03:30,936 --> 02:03:33,004
l might have taken you anywhere

1548
02:03:33,005 --> 02:03:34,038
Even you would have followed me

1549
02:03:34,039 --> 02:03:36,107
Because, you had liked me

1550
02:03:36,108 --> 02:03:38,510
But l never misbehaved with
you in anyway

1551
02:03:38,511 --> 02:03:40,779
l never behaved against
your wishes

1552
02:03:40,780 --> 02:03:42,514
Doesn't your heart know about this

1553
02:03:42,515 --> 02:03:43,848
Believe me

1554
02:03:43,849 --> 02:03:46,251
My love is true

1555
02:03:46,252 --> 02:03:49,252
lt's enough if you forgive me

1556
02:03:51,991 --> 02:03:54,991
The way you've spoken to me reveals
your real character

1557
02:03:55,294 --> 02:03:58,294
ln those 5 days you thought of
taking me anywhere

1558
02:03:59,064 --> 02:04:02,064
And you say that l would have
followed you isn't it?

1559
02:04:03,803 --> 02:04:06,803
You are a street rowdy, isn't it?

1560
02:04:06,872 --> 02:04:08,940
So, you'll talk like this only

1561
02:04:08,941 --> 02:04:11,941
But don't think of winning a
girl with your tricks

1562
02:04:14,680 --> 02:04:17,680
You can't play with me

1563
02:04:20,686 --> 02:04:22,720
On that day you said, you like me

1564
02:04:22,721 --> 02:04:24,422
You also asked me, when l am
going to marry you

1565
02:04:24,423 --> 02:04:25,990
Don't you like me now?

1566
02:04:25,991 --> 02:04:27,625
You?! l don't like you

1567
02:04:27,626 --> 02:04:28,526
Why?

1568
02:04:28,527 --> 02:04:29,727
Oh! you like only that fellow

1569
02:04:29,728 --> 02:04:32,728
Yes! l like him only

1570
02:04:45,678 --> 02:04:47,579
Can't you understand me?

1571
02:04:47,580 --> 02:04:50,580
What else you want me to do?

1572
02:04:55,554 --> 02:04:58,554
l am saying sorry, isn't it?

1573
02:05:12,304 --> 02:05:15,304
Before coming to lndia l had seen
an apartment in Seattle

1574
02:05:17,176 --> 02:05:20,176
Today morning l contacted my friend
and asked him to purchase it

1575
02:05:29,355 --> 02:05:32,355
Reena, your Visa papers
will come tomorrow

1576
02:05:32,758 --> 02:05:33,892
l need your passport

1577
02:05:33,893 --> 02:05:36,893
l have to give it to the Travel Agent

1578
02:05:38,430 --> 02:05:40,965
Have you informed your office or not?

1579
02:05:40,966 --> 02:05:43,966
Have you given the notice?

1580
02:06:05,758 --> 02:06:08,758
Tell me, what is your problem?

1581
02:06:09,128 --> 02:06:10,128
Do you want to talk to her?

1582
02:06:10,129 --> 02:06:11,563
You want to talk to Reena

1583
02:06:11,564 --> 02:06:14,399
Are you loving her?

1584
02:06:14,400 --> 02:06:16,234
Do you want me to tell her
that you love her

1585
02:06:16,235 --> 02:06:18,403
Hey! look at me

1586
02:06:18,404 --> 02:06:19,070
Look at me...

1587
02:06:19,071 --> 02:06:20,238
Look at me, when l am talking to you

1588
02:06:20,239 --> 02:06:23,239
You want to know whether
she loves you or not?

1589
02:06:27,880 --> 02:06:28,780
Ask her

1590
02:06:28,781 --> 02:06:30,014
Now, she is before you, ask her

1591
02:06:30,015 --> 02:06:32,650
Reena, today we should conclude
this issue

1592
02:06:32,651 --> 02:06:34,352
Why are you keeping quiet?

1593
02:06:34,353 --> 02:06:35,853
l am the person who's going
to marry her

1594
02:06:35,854 --> 02:06:37,188
Within few days she is going to
be my life partner

1595
02:06:37,189 --> 02:06:38,756
l am telling you to talk to her

1596
02:06:38,757 --> 02:06:41,757
Shall l go & stand there?

1597
02:06:42,061 --> 02:06:45,061
Talk to her

1598
02:06:46,599 --> 02:06:49,133
He who tries to win a woman by
force against her wish

1599
02:06:49,134 --> 02:06:50,735
He's not at all considered
to be a man

1600
02:06:50,736 --> 02:06:52,670
You were a rogue during college days

1601
02:06:52,671 --> 02:06:54,205
l thought that you might've
changed by now

1602
02:06:54,206 --> 02:06:57,206
But now you have become
an eve–teaser

1603
02:07:07,419 --> 02:07:10,419
How many times should l tell you?

1604
02:07:11,390 --> 02:07:14,390
Please, l am requesting you

1605
02:07:15,060 --> 02:07:16,294
lf l find you at Reena's place again...

1606
02:07:16,295 --> 02:07:19,295
l will kill you

1607
02:07:27,206 --> 02:07:29,807
Take this...drink it
–No need

1608
02:07:29,808 --> 02:07:31,976
Drink..
–No, l don't want it

1609
02:07:31,977 --> 02:07:33,311
Hey! drink it

1610
02:07:33,312 --> 02:07:36,312
Drink it...

1611
02:07:37,349 --> 02:07:40,349
Have this..

1612
02:07:43,522 --> 02:07:46,224
Be careful...careful

1613
02:07:46,225 --> 02:07:48,726
Buddy, how can he hit him?

1614
02:07:48,727 --> 02:07:50,595
ls he a big rowdy?

1615
02:07:50,596 --> 02:07:52,730
He dare to do that because
of that girl

1616
02:07:52,731 --> 02:07:53,931
Do you think, we'll keep quiet?

1617
02:07:53,932 --> 02:07:55,667
Buddy, we should not leave him

1618
02:07:55,668 --> 02:07:57,635
He was your enemy in your college
as well as in your life

1619
02:07:57,636 --> 02:08:00,038
One word is enough from you we will
admit him in the hospital

1620
02:08:00,039 --> 02:08:01,005
Buddy...

1621
02:08:01,006 --> 02:08:03,608
Buddy...you are a good person

1622
02:08:03,609 --> 02:08:05,777
You had roamed with that girl
and at any time...

1623
02:08:05,778 --> 02:08:07,478
At any time...

1624
02:08:07,479 --> 02:08:08,980
Did you misbehave with her any time?

1625
02:08:08,981 --> 02:08:10,648
You never touched her with
bad intentions

1626
02:08:10,649 --> 02:08:11,849
No..isn't it?

1627
02:08:11,850 --> 02:08:13,184
You are a very good person

1628
02:08:13,185 --> 02:08:16,185
He will be ruined
–Hey, stop your sentiments

1629
02:08:16,355 --> 02:08:18,556
Hey! it's alright, if you don't get her

1630
02:08:18,557 --> 02:08:19,857
But, he shouldn't get her

1631
02:08:19,858 --> 02:08:21,192
Tell him 
–Yes

1632
02:08:21,193 --> 02:08:22,460
Buddy, think about it

1633
02:08:22,461 --> 02:08:23,127
Come....let's go.

1634
02:08:23,128 --> 02:08:26,097
Just say a word, we'll bash him up

1635
02:08:26,098 --> 02:08:29,098
His chapter will be closed

1636
02:08:30,402 --> 02:08:31,436
Take an auto

1637
02:08:31,437 --> 02:08:34,437
Come, let's go

1638
02:08:47,252 --> 02:08:50,252
Hey, don't leave him, hold him

1639
02:08:54,827 --> 02:08:57,361
Hey, what's it?

1640
02:08:57,362 --> 02:08:58,663
Why are you acting very smart?

1641
02:08:58,664 --> 02:09:01,032
Won't you understand
if we tell you once?

1642
02:09:01,033 --> 02:09:02,734
Why don't you leave this place?

1643
02:09:02,735 --> 02:09:05,103
Are you asking us to parcel
you to America?

1644
02:09:05,104 --> 02:09:06,504
Who are you to parcel me?

1645
02:09:06,505 --> 02:09:09,505
Hey! shut your mouth...

1646
02:09:22,621 --> 02:09:24,522
Take this

1647
02:09:24,523 --> 02:09:26,691
Hey, come on

1648
02:09:26,692 --> 02:09:28,025
Hit him

1649
02:09:28,026 --> 02:09:31,026
Finish him first...
hit him...

1650
02:09:32,097 --> 02:09:33,765
Are you showing your smartness?

1651
02:09:33,766 --> 02:09:36,766
Hit him
–Hit..

1652
02:09:36,935 --> 02:09:38,870
Buddy, hit him first

1653
02:09:38,871 --> 02:09:40,571
Hit him

1654
02:09:40,572 --> 02:09:43,572
Don't spare him, hit him

1655
02:09:45,344 --> 02:09:47,512
Hit him first
–Rajesh, hit him

1656
02:09:47,513 --> 02:09:50,513
Don't spare him, hit him

1657
02:09:50,916 --> 02:09:51,983
First, hit him

1658
02:09:51,984 --> 02:09:53,217
Don't look, hit him fast

1659
02:09:53,218 --> 02:09:56,218
Don't look, hit him first
–Hit him, hit him...

1660
02:10:00,959 --> 02:10:03,227
Go away from here

1661
02:10:03,228 --> 02:10:06,228
Go away...Go away...

1662
02:10:10,435 --> 02:10:11,736
Hey! what's this?

1663
02:10:11,737 --> 02:10:14,737
Hey! what happened to you
– Leave me...

1664
02:10:22,981 --> 02:10:25,981
Reena likes him only

1665
02:10:27,553 --> 02:10:30,553
That's why...

1666
02:10:30,956 --> 02:10:33,956
Leave it

1667
02:10:37,696 --> 02:10:40,231
lf she doesn't want my love...

1668
02:10:40,232 --> 02:10:43,232
What's the use of hitting him?

1669
02:10:49,274 --> 02:10:51,042
Hey! where are you going?

1670
02:10:51,043 --> 02:10:53,110
l am going to the office, why are you
asking, as if l'm going newly?

1671
02:10:53,111 --> 02:10:56,111
Why are you shouting?

1672
02:10:57,282 --> 02:11:00,051
Sekhar told me about yesterday's incident

1673
02:11:00,052 --> 02:11:02,086
lt's wrong to go and hit him

1674
02:11:02,087 --> 02:11:04,155
lt's even worse to return
without hitting him

1675
02:11:04,156 --> 02:11:07,156
Leave it Subbuni, there is no
use of hitting him

1676
02:11:08,694 --> 02:11:11,694
Then, that girl's chapter is closed

1677
02:11:11,997 --> 02:11:14,997
Are you closing that book
without reading it?

1678
02:11:17,002 --> 02:11:19,937
From the beginning, l've read
that book upside down

1679
02:11:19,938 --> 02:11:22,938
That's why, l had to close it half way

1680
02:11:49,368 --> 02:11:52,368
Shall we discuss this tomorrow?

1681
02:12:04,283 --> 02:12:07,283
Both the rings are beautiful

1682
02:12:09,588 --> 02:12:12,588
l am not able to decide it

1683
02:12:12,691 --> 02:12:15,593
Which one do you like? tell me

1684
02:12:15,594 --> 02:12:16,994
Even l too don't know

1685
02:12:16,995 --> 02:12:19,995
Hey! don't you need the ring?
Tell me

1686
02:12:21,066 --> 02:12:24,066
lf l am in a confusion

1687
02:12:25,003 --> 02:12:27,038
l'll decide by closing my eyes

1688
02:12:27,039 --> 02:12:30,039
Will you decide by closing
your eyes?

1689
02:12:31,076 --> 02:12:34,076
Shall l try?

1690
02:12:45,590 --> 02:12:48,590
l can see only you

1691
02:12:48,994 --> 02:12:50,995
l have seen this also

1692
02:12:50,996 --> 02:12:53,996
Do you like it?

1693
02:12:58,003 --> 02:13:00,037
After dropping you here
l went to my home

1694
02:13:00,038 --> 02:13:02,139
When l closed my eyes to sleep

1695
02:13:02,140 --> 02:13:04,742
l had a dream in which you were
searching for me

1696
02:13:04,743 --> 02:13:05,710
That's why, l came

1697
02:13:05,711 --> 02:13:08,711
Well done my boy

1698
02:14:33,799 --> 02:14:36,799
How long will you sit here
come on, tell me

1699
02:14:36,835 --> 02:14:38,669
Sekhar told that he'll be coming

1700
02:14:38,670 --> 02:14:40,137
Did he say that?

1701
02:14:40,138 --> 02:14:43,138
He is waiting for you since
a long time

1702
02:14:43,642 --> 02:14:46,642
Hey, Did you agree the
Singapore contract?

1703
02:14:48,180 --> 02:14:49,280
Sekhar told me...

1704
02:14:49,281 --> 02:14:50,014
Not that

1705
02:14:50,015 --> 02:14:52,083
lt seems that Sir's tickets
are also ready

1706
02:14:52,084 --> 02:14:55,019
l thought of telling you this...
but before that, you...

1707
02:14:55,020 --> 02:14:56,921
For all these years you
had bean saying that

1708
02:14:56,922 --> 02:14:59,423
Grandpa Subbuni is there for you

1709
02:14:59,424 --> 02:15:01,225
Now, what happened to
Subbuni grandpa?

1710
02:15:01,226 --> 02:15:02,726
ls he no more?

1711
02:15:02,727 --> 02:15:04,028
Oh God!...grandpa

1712
02:15:04,029 --> 02:15:05,796
Hey! then, what is this?

1713
02:15:05,797 --> 02:15:08,165
You are not in a position
to forget that girl

1714
02:15:08,166 --> 02:15:11,166
lf you go to Singapore
will you forget her?

1715
02:15:11,970 --> 02:15:12,770
Tell me

1716
02:15:12,771 --> 02:15:15,639
Grandpa leave that...

1717
02:15:15,640 --> 02:15:18,442
There is no connection between that
girl and this one

1718
02:15:18,443 --> 02:15:21,443
Her chapter is already over

1719
02:15:23,315 --> 02:15:25,449
They are paying 6000 dollars
per month in Singapore

1720
02:15:25,450 --> 02:15:28,052
Leaving that, what's there
if l stay here

1721
02:15:28,053 --> 02:15:30,054
Grandpa this is 1 year contract

1722
02:15:30,055 --> 02:15:31,689
l will send you the tickets
within one month

1723
02:15:31,690 --> 02:15:33,157
You should come there

1724
02:15:33,158 --> 02:15:36,158
Grandpa, l heard that Singapore
girl's are very beautiful

1725
02:15:36,161 --> 02:15:37,194
They do something called as...

1726
02:15:37,195 --> 02:15:38,562
Sandwich massage

1727
02:15:38,563 --> 02:15:40,197
We both will go together

1728
02:15:40,198 --> 02:15:43,198
lnstead of enjoying in this age
...if l stay here...

1729
02:15:43,235 --> 02:15:46,070
Look Grandpa...

1730
02:15:46,071 --> 02:15:48,372
Be cool, grandpa

1731
02:15:48,373 --> 02:15:49,306
Come, let's go

1732
02:15:49,307 --> 02:15:50,741
Sekhar is waiting for us

1733
02:15:50,742 --> 02:15:53,742
We will bear him for some time

1734
02:15:58,850 --> 02:16:01,850
Bangalore transfer is some
what difficult...

1735
02:16:02,120 --> 02:16:03,587
Father knows few people there

1736
02:16:03,588 --> 02:16:06,588
l will contact them and tell you

1737
02:16:06,758 --> 02:16:09,758
She is coming

1738
02:16:12,898 --> 02:16:14,398
My name is Ravi!

1739
02:16:14,399 --> 02:16:16,233
l am....leave it

1740
02:16:16,234 --> 02:16:19,234
He's our Rajesh

1741
02:16:19,437 --> 02:16:20,604
He's Rajesh's grandpa

1742
02:16:20,605 --> 02:16:23,605
He said that he wants to talk to you?
Will you talk....?

1743
02:16:26,611 --> 02:16:27,811
Greetings!

1744
02:16:27,812 --> 02:16:30,812
Talk to her!

1745
02:16:31,216 --> 02:16:34,216
Are you Reena?
–Yes

1746
02:16:35,153 --> 02:16:38,153
You know our Rajesh very
well, isn't it?

1747
02:16:40,125 --> 02:16:42,426
l'm his grandfather

1748
02:16:42,427 --> 02:16:43,761
What do you want now?

1749
02:16:43,762 --> 02:16:45,729
l want my grandson

1750
02:16:45,730 --> 02:16:47,798
And he wants you

1751
02:16:47,799 --> 02:16:50,799
We don't have mental peace
because of his problem

1752
02:16:51,603 --> 02:16:53,270
There is a proverb

1753
02:16:53,271 --> 02:16:56,271
Perform one marriage even at the
cost of 1000 lies

1754
02:16:56,308 --> 02:16:59,308
But, my grandson has spoken
only one lie

1755
02:16:59,644 --> 02:17:01,478
Even that, he didn't
speak on his own

1756
02:17:01,479 --> 02:17:04,479
He told that lie on my motivation

1757
02:17:05,150 --> 02:17:07,184
l told him to tell the truth
with conviction

1758
02:17:07,185 --> 02:17:09,553
She will get angry immediately
after knowing the truth

1759
02:17:09,554 --> 02:17:12,554
Later slowly that anger
will subside

1760
02:17:13,658 --> 02:17:16,658
But, you never understood
his Love

1761
02:17:17,062 --> 02:17:19,663
You don't know about Rajesh

1762
02:17:19,664 --> 02:17:22,664
He got a job in Singapore
with $10,000

1763
02:17:24,669 --> 02:17:27,669
He said, Grandpa is important
for me, not the job

1764
02:17:29,007 --> 02:17:31,875
But now, he is going for only $6000

1765
02:17:31,876 --> 02:17:33,177
Why?

1766
02:17:33,178 --> 02:17:36,146
He's not intrested to stay here

1767
02:17:36,147 --> 02:17:39,147
Now, you're more important
to him than me

1768
02:17:39,417 --> 02:17:42,086
You are more important than his
life to him

1769
02:17:42,087 --> 02:17:44,054
Please, don't bein a haste

1770
02:17:44,055 --> 02:17:47,055
Understand him and then say
you love him

1771
02:17:48,026 --> 02:17:51,026
But don't say 'No' to him

1772
02:17:51,229 --> 02:17:54,229
l had asked Rajesh whether he's
like his father or mother

1773
02:17:57,035 --> 02:17:59,937
He had told me that he's
like his grandpa

1774
02:17:59,938 --> 02:18:02,938
Are you that grandpa?

1775
02:18:04,476 --> 02:18:07,111
You've come very late

1776
02:18:07,112 --> 02:18:10,047
So many things had happened
without my knowledge

1777
02:18:10,048 --> 02:18:13,048
Still, it's continuing

1778
02:18:13,885 --> 02:18:16,587
Nothing is in my hands

1779
02:18:16,588 --> 02:18:19,588
You find some other good
girl for Rajesh

1780
02:18:22,360 --> 02:18:25,360
At least tell her the truth
at that time

1781
02:18:25,430 --> 02:18:28,430
Please, ask Rajesh to forget me

1782
02:18:35,607 --> 02:18:36,740
What Subbuni?

1783
02:18:36,741 --> 02:18:39,276
Did you hear her advice?

1784
02:18:39,277 --> 02:18:42,277
This will not work, Subbuni

1785
02:18:42,647 --> 02:18:45,647
Hey, l'm telling you from
my experience

1786
02:18:46,084 --> 02:18:49,084
This girl will never
forget my grandson

1787
02:18:50,522 --> 02:18:51,422
No Sam!

1788
02:18:51,423 --> 02:18:53,424
l had spoken to that
girl several times

1789
02:18:53,425 --> 02:18:55,326
She is not at all responding

1790
02:18:55,327 --> 02:18:56,093
Oh! l see

1791
02:18:56,094 --> 02:18:57,761
lntroduce that girl to me once

1792
02:18:57,762 --> 02:18:58,796
l will help you

1793
02:18:58,797 --> 02:19:01,565
Hey, Rajeev

1794
02:19:01,566 --> 02:19:04,101
What happened to that girl's matter?
Hey, leave that matter

1795
02:19:04,102 --> 02:19:05,369
Swimming pool is full of water

1796
02:19:05,370 --> 02:19:08,370
With more kick you may fall into it
Be careful!

1797
02:19:08,807 --> 02:19:11,807
Hey,Check whether the chicken fry
is ready! Go...

1798
02:19:14,846 --> 02:19:15,946
What did l say?

1799
02:19:15,947 --> 02:19:17,681
You told to introduce...

1800
02:19:17,682 --> 02:19:18,949
Yes....lf you introduce her then l...

1801
02:19:18,950 --> 02:19:21,950
One Senior bachelor has come
to meet you

1802
02:19:24,389 --> 02:19:25,522
Who?

1803
02:19:25,523 --> 02:19:28,523
Has he came to meet me?
–Yes!

1804
02:19:32,497 --> 02:19:35,466
Sir, you...

1805
02:19:35,467 --> 02:19:38,467
You're American Rajeev, isn't it?
- Yes

1806
02:19:39,804 --> 02:19:42,306
Why're you standing?
Please be seated

1807
02:19:42,307 --> 02:19:45,307
l'm Rajesh's grandpa
–What's the matter?

1808
02:19:49,481 --> 02:19:52,149
l want to talk to you

1809
02:19:52,150 --> 02:19:53,984
Regarding?

1810
02:19:53,985 --> 02:19:56,985
About my grandson & Reena

1811
02:19:58,323 --> 02:20:00,157
l can't understand

1812
02:20:00,158 --> 02:20:03,158
My grandson Rajesh & Reena
loved each other

1813
02:20:04,996 --> 02:20:06,163
You don't know anything

1814
02:20:06,164 --> 02:20:07,498
Don't talk unnecessarily

1815
02:20:07,499 --> 02:20:10,499
lt's you, who doesn't
know anything

1816
02:20:11,503 --> 02:20:14,503
Rajesh and your Reena....

1817
02:20:16,307 --> 02:20:18,842
Not for 1 or 2 days

1818
02:20:18,843 --> 02:20:21,843
But for 5 days they both had met
and exchanged their hearts

1819
02:20:21,846 --> 02:20:24,846
She even asked him openly
When will you marry me?

1820
02:20:27,352 --> 02:20:29,520
lt was wrong to use your name

1821
02:20:29,521 --> 02:20:32,521
But, it doesn't mean that she
loves only American Rajeev

1822
02:20:35,860 --> 02:20:38,860
Love between Rajesh and Reena
is an absolute truth

1823
02:20:39,197 --> 02:20:41,198
You are saying like this...

1824
02:20:41,199 --> 02:20:43,867
But when l had spoken to Reena about
this, let me tell, what she said

1825
02:20:43,868 --> 02:20:46,868
She requested me not to speak even
a word about Rajesh

1826
02:20:48,039 --> 02:20:49,873
Do you understand?
What will you say for this?

1827
02:20:49,874 --> 02:20:52,874
Nothing wrong in it brother
She was angry with us

1828
02:20:55,046 --> 02:20:57,381
She was angry because
we had told her a lie

1829
02:20:57,382 --> 02:21:00,382
That is a type of mock anger

1830
02:21:01,553 --> 02:21:04,553
This is quiet common
between lovers

1831
02:21:06,057 --> 02:21:09,057
Look, my parents had decided
long back our marriage

1832
02:21:10,395 --> 02:21:13,230
l've also decided!
l like her very much

1833
02:21:13,231 --> 02:21:15,399
Okay! Sunny....Okay!

1834
02:21:15,400 --> 02:21:18,400
You & your parents, Elders would've
decided about Betrothal & Marriage

1835
02:21:23,575 --> 02:21:26,575
But, did everyone ever tried to ask
what's there in her heart?

1836
02:21:27,579 --> 02:21:28,912
No!

1837
02:21:28,913 --> 02:21:30,581
Shall l tell you, what's
there in it?

1838
02:21:30,582 --> 02:21:31,582
Love!

1839
02:21:31,583 --> 02:21:34,583
You talked big about betrothal,Marriage
...this...and that.. Auspicious time

1840
02:21:36,254 --> 02:21:37,921
They can be changed at any time

1841
02:21:37,922 --> 02:21:39,756
They'll change according to
our will & wish

1842
02:21:39,757 --> 02:21:42,757
But, Love will never change
under any circumstances

1843
02:21:44,095 --> 02:21:46,930
Because, it is equal to God

1844
02:21:46,931 --> 02:21:49,931
As said by you
Love is equal to God

1845
02:21:50,101 --> 02:21:53,101
But, your grandson doesn't
know anything about it

1846
02:21:53,271 --> 02:21:55,939
All he knows is fights & Brawls

1847
02:21:55,940 --> 02:21:58,275
Even after knowing that l'm
going to marry Reena

1848
02:21:58,276 --> 02:22:00,277
...He's trying to spoil it
with jealousy

1849
02:22:00,278 --> 02:22:03,278
Son! l'm saying this with
good will for you only

1850
02:22:07,619 --> 02:22:10,619
Knowing very well that there's some one
else in that girl's heart

1851
02:22:14,125 --> 02:22:17,125
...lf you marry her!
Will your life be happy?

1852
02:22:22,634 --> 02:22:25,634
l'm happy for your concern
about my happiness

1853
02:22:27,472 --> 02:22:30,472
Look! Don't waste your time

1854
02:22:31,309 --> 02:22:34,309
Why are you running all around
at this old age?

1855
02:22:36,981 --> 02:22:39,981
Get me an lnvitation Card!

1856
02:22:46,991 --> 02:22:49,991
Tomorrow our marriage will
definitely take place!

1857
02:23:00,672 --> 02:23:03,672
Don't say another word!
Please go away

1858
02:23:18,856 --> 02:23:21,856
You don't worry! our boys will
lay siege to their house

1859
02:23:21,859 --> 02:23:23,193
...They'll enter their house and
create trouble

1860
02:23:23,194 --> 02:23:26,194
They'll somehow stop the marriage
ls it Okay?

1861
02:23:26,197 --> 02:23:28,365
Yuck!
–What yuck?

1862
02:23:28,366 --> 02:23:30,534
You want to slip silently to
Singapore tomorrow isn't it?

1863
02:23:30,535 --> 02:23:33,535
Wherever you may go, you can never
forget her even for a moment

1864
02:23:35,540 --> 02:23:38,540
l can't forget her! Yes!
l've not forgotten her even now

1865
02:23:39,544 --> 02:23:42,544
But, l can forget her!
...l'll forget her

1866
02:29:27,391 --> 02:29:29,726
Hey! What's the time?

1867
02:29:29,727 --> 02:29:32,727
Shall we go now?

1868
02:29:34,565 --> 02:29:37,565
What's it?

1869
02:29:50,915 --> 02:29:53,915
Looks like l'll cast an
evil eye myself

1870
02:29:55,086 --> 02:29:58,086
Do you know how beautiful
you look?

1871
02:30:05,429 --> 02:30:08,429
What's this urgency?
You'll spoil my Rose

1872
02:30:08,933 --> 02:30:10,433
Why do you need a Rose?
Give it to the groom

1873
02:30:10,434 --> 02:30:12,102
ls it?

1874
02:30:12,103 --> 02:30:15,103
Then, for me? -Are you the groom?
...Come with me

1875
02:30:38,129 --> 02:30:41,129
Flight is at 7.30, l must
be at Airport by 5.30

1876
02:30:41,132 --> 02:30:44,132
Come!

1877
02:31:11,228 --> 02:31:14,228
Come!

1878
02:32:19,230 --> 02:32:20,897
Dear People!

1879
02:32:20,898 --> 02:32:23,898
We've gathered here to unite this man
& woman as husband & wife

1880
02:32:23,901 --> 02:32:26,901
These both are getting married
in your presence

1881
02:32:36,080 --> 02:32:39,080
Who's going to give away
the bride?

1882
02:32:53,764 --> 02:32:56,764
...The vows taken by them...

1883
02:33:31,969 --> 02:33:34,969
Jesus!Who'll save his children
at all times

1884
02:33:34,972 --> 02:33:36,306
Merciful father!

1885
02:33:36,307 --> 02:33:39,307
...The marrying couple should

You said isn't it? When you're confused
you'll close your eyes & decide

02:37:53,063 --> 02:37:55,998
Are you going to Singapore?

Are you going on getting a job?.....

....Or going off defeated?
Why're you going away?

Before you go away! Shall we decide
between us once for all?

1929
02:38:10,747 --> 02:38:12,582
No, Sam!

1930
02:38:12,583 --> 02:38:15,583

You can go! but one important thing

l can marry Reena and take her
with me in just 2 days

1937
02:38:58,962 --> 02:39:01,962
You may not know even her
where abouts all your life

1938
02:39:01,965 --> 02:39:04,965
You'll get depressed with
her memories

1939

l can enjoy it happily
& be happy

1940

Last stroke is mine

1941
02:39:12,309 --> 02:39:13,809
You can't live with that, isn't it?

1942
02:39:13,810 --> 02:39:16,810
Hey! What are you blabbering?

1943

We both will always remain
