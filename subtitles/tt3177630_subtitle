1
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:11,000
Barely five minutes had passed...

2
00:01:12,375 --> 00:01:16,000
Mother had just put me to sleep
And gone to father’s room.

3
00:01:18,416 --> 00:01:23,333
I remember it was a Sunday afternoon,
father was at home.

4
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:29,916
Usually mother would go to
his room every night.

5
00:01:31,166 --> 00:01:33,541
Father slept in a separate room.

6
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:39,375
They had quarrelled the night before.

7
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:44,166
That day mother had been feverish
since that afternoon.

8
00:01:45,166 --> 00:01:49,333
So she did not go to father's room.
Instead she fell asleep by my side.

9
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:56,708
After some time father came and
dragged mother into his room.

10
00:01:58,291 --> 00:02:00,625
They quarrelled again.

11
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:04,291
Father... battered my mother.

12
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,833
Next day, it was the same story.

13
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:14,208
I don't know why...
I was terrified. I even cried.

14
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:18,916
I think... I wet my pants.

15
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:24,541
In fear, I was banging on his door.

16
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:28,458
Screaming out for my mother.

17
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:32,541
After a while father came out.

18
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:39,000
He took me in his lap and burnt my
thigh with a smoldering cigarette.

19
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,833
I screamed in agony.

20
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:48,666
I was in extreme pain.

21
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:55,041
Then, father dragged me
into the bathroom.

22
00:02:56,625 --> 00:03:00,458
He held my face down
in a bucket of water.

23
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:06,166
I nearly choked to death.

24
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:11,000
Mother tried to rescue me.

25
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:15,083
But was unsuccessful.

26
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:19,958
She screamed for help.

27
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:24,500
I don’t remember anything after that.

28
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:27,708
When I regained consciousness...

29
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:32,125
I was on the neighbor's
bed by my mother's side.

30
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:08,708
Sister-in law...
Sister-in law...

31
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:14,541
I have slept a bit too long.

32
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:19,708
My head is spinning.

33
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:25,083
Have you given him tea?

34
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:27,958
Who is there?

35
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,750
What do you mean?
Are you out of your mind?

36
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:39,333
Looks like you had
an unusual dream.

37
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:43,500
Stop fooling around!

38
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:52,208
Go give him tea!

39
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:57,750
Give tea to whom?
There is no one here!

40
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,666
Isn't Rahul there?
- Who?

41
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:06,458
Has he left then…?

42
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:12,208
Without informing me.
How is that possible?

43
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:16,541
Who are you talking about?

44
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:21,125
Rahul. He came from Alirajpur
You were always with him.

45
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:27,375
What are you talking about?
Won't I remember if I was with him?

46
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:32,125
Won't I remember if
I was with him?

47
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,333
You really don't
remember a thing?

48
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:42,166
He was your brother's friend.
He stayed with us for a few days.

49
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:46,333
You cannot remember anything?

50
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:51,125
Why would I fool around?
Really, I am confused.

51
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:58,333
That means he left last night after
the rain, with his suitcase.

52
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:02,125
Before he left he
erased your memory.

53
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,000
How is that possible?

54
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:10,500
Who opened the door for him?
Is the main door locked?

55
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:14,541
Yes, like always.

56
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,083
But, I can't understand
what you are saying.

57
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:23,375
You knew him?
But I have not seen anyone.

58
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:29,083
Yes, I knew him,
I knew him very well…

59
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:21,166
Another blank call!
What a nuisance!

60
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:26,500
Sister-in law...
Should I file a complaint?

61
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:30,833
No, it's not necessary.
It doesn't bother me.

62
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,750
Those who call have
the urge and the means.

63
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:40,166
I can't understand
how you tolerate this!

64
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:46,208
I've come from Alirajpur.

65
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:49,208
Where Madan works…

66
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:52,416
We work in the same factory.

67
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:58,541
Don't you remember me?

68
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:01,416
We were neighbors.

69
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:05,708
It's been a while since you left.

70
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:17,083
Devi, what are you thinking?

71
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:20,708
Why have I come in
search of you?

72
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:25,166
Even I don't know.

73
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,833
This is your bedroom.

74
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,583
That is the bathroom.

75
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:46,375
Why don't you take a shower.
I will warm your food.

76
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,666
Shila, clean that room.

77
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:57,666
And take out the mosquito net too.

78
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:01,708
Is the bed sheet clean?

79
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:06,333
Sister-in-law, do you know him?
- Yes.

80
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,375
What did he say
about my brother?

81
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:13,208
He worked with your brother.

82
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,666
What do you think?
Is he telling the truth?

83
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,666
I don't know.

84
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:21,083
Just do your work.

85
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,916
Don't you recognize me?

86
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:17,083
Or maybe you don't want to?

87
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:21,541
We're meeting after
such a long time.

88
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:27,000
But surprisingly you
don't seem too pleased.

89
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:34,458
Then why did you call me?

90
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:39,541
Answer me…?

91
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:55,083
You really don't remember me?

92
00:13:56,458 --> 00:14:00,541
Or you're pretending.

93
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:10,333
Madan was suspicious
and you broke up.

94
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:16,208
It is a matter of trust...

95
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:21,458
He was always suspicious of you.

96
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:28,500
He used to torture you.
Physically torture.

97
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:33,000
And it was to such an extent that...

98
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:37,375
it was difficult to keep one's sanity.

99
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:44,208
Devi, can you deny
that you called me?

100
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:51,708
I've wanted to see
you for a long time.

101
00:14:54,041 --> 00:15:00,166
Who knows how the
human mind works?

102
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:08,458
But you knew...

103
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:12,916
I would come.

104
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:16,791
Why did you not wait
for me at the jetty?

105
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:20,791
I had a lot of trouble
finding this house.

106
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:26,166
It's been such a long time...

107
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:41,416
Devi, why do you refuse
to recognize me?

108
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:45,250
What are you trying to prove?

109
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:51,166
I have enough proof
to convince you.

110
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:57,250
But I am afraid to
tell you the truth.

111
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:07,125
My situation is like a
gun with a single bullet.

112
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:15,000
If it misfires, I am finished.
As long as I have the bullet I have hope.

113
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:21,125
I am sure you recognize me.

114
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:24,625
So why this game of hide & seek?

115
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,833
In Alirajpur we often met.

116
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:33,458
In Madan's company...

117
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:36,458
and in his absence.

118
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:41,791
You were not like this then.
We enjoyed each other’s company.

119
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:46,500
Why have you changed?

120
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:08,583
Aren’t you tired
of acting, Devi?

121
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:12,916
Why don't you admit that
we know each other?

122
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,625
You know very well...

123
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:21,291
How often I would peep
through your bedroom window.

124
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:24,541
I was jealous of Madan.

125
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,875
He had such a beautiful wife.

126
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:33,541
Unfortunately he was
suspicious and he lost you.

127
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:38,125
Listen, yesterday was the
first time I saw you.

128
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:41,125
And immediately you have
started telling tales.

129
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:46,750
These lies don't affect me
or hurt me anymore.

130
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:50,666
Those days are gone.

131
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:56,666
Devi, I know why
your marriage failed.

132
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:03,666
Madan never trusted you.
And one day he ran away.

133
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:11,875
Devi, do you remember
those days?

134
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:14,916
When Madan worked night shifts.

135
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:19,791
At midnight, dressed like a bride
You would stand by your window…

136
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:26,666
Casting shy glances
and looking at me.

137
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:31,291
You looked stunning.

138
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:36,041
I knew you wanted me.

139
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:39,750
I could have taken
advantage of you then.

140
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:45,166
But I did not.

141
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:48,041
Since then we have
been intimate.

142
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:53,916
No. I have only loved Madan.
No one else.

143
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:59,541
If he had only reciprocated
my love for him.

144
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:04,375
This day would not have come.

145
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:14,750
All women say that they
only love their husband.

146
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:19,958
But, there exists not
a single woman...

147
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:26,291
...who has not wished
her husband’s death, at least once.

148
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:07,125
When do you think my
brother will return?

149
00:23:08,416 --> 00:23:11,041
I can't say.

150
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:15,500
Is there really a place
called Alirajpur?

151
00:23:16,125 --> 00:23:19,791
What do you think?
Can such a place exist?

152
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,625
How would I know?

153
00:23:23,666 --> 00:23:28,125
Alirajpur is ancient…
The Pandavas were exiled there.

154
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:34,083
Shila, we have to believe
in many things...

155
00:23:34,833 --> 00:23:38,916
...that we have neither
seen nor heard.

156
00:23:41,708 --> 00:23:44,375
I don’t think sister-in-law
believes in it.

157
00:23:45,708 --> 00:23:50,125
Alirajpur is a couple of
thousand years old…

158
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,625
It was covered
with dense forest.

159
00:23:55,791 --> 00:23:59,625
With the rise of civilization
the forest diminished.

160
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:04,958
Then, the British came.

161
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:08,041
They destroyed the forest
and made a factory.

162
00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:17,375
With the factory came
colonies, townships, roads.

163
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,083
And civilization began...

164
00:24:25,916 --> 00:24:28,541
Killings, destructions...

165
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:33,250
Civilization progressed.

166
00:24:33,833 --> 00:24:36,500
The old order gave
way to the new ways.

167
00:24:37,833 --> 00:24:41,833
Then came partition,
a few more factories...

168
00:24:42,916 --> 00:24:47,875
Railroads, bridges,
riots, refugee camps...

169
00:24:49,916 --> 00:24:52,541
Things changed completely.

170
00:24:54,083 --> 00:24:59,000
Tell me honestly.
Is my brother really in Alirajpur?

171
00:24:59,791 --> 00:25:02,458
You don't believe me.

172
00:25:49,875 --> 00:25:54,250
Devi, you have come to
me several times before.

173
00:25:55,041 --> 00:25:58,583
Lost and shattered,
after fighting with Madan.

174
00:25:59,333 --> 00:26:03,500
Of course, I too desired you.

175
00:26:04,833 --> 00:26:10,708
I would go crazy in your company
and would not want anything.

176
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,416
But I never took advantage.

177
00:26:18,375 --> 00:26:22,458
Devi, I love you.
For the sake of loving you.

178
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,625
I can't live without loving you.

179
00:26:27,583 --> 00:26:30,625
If that is the case, where
were you for so long?

180
00:26:31,541 --> 00:26:34,166
Where was this love?

181
00:26:35,791 --> 00:26:38,458
It has been a long time
since I returned.

182
00:26:40,958 --> 00:26:45,083
You didn’t even write a
letter to enquire about me.

183
00:26:52,166 --> 00:26:57,333
I would wait for you every day.

184
00:26:59,875 --> 00:27:03,583
Every evening I would
look for you at the jetty.

185
00:27:26,083 --> 00:27:30,500
When Madan left me
I was not shattered.

186
00:27:33,083 --> 00:27:37,000
My family members blamed
me for everything.

187
00:27:38,916 --> 00:27:41,541
I did not succumb
infront of them.

188
00:27:42,916 --> 00:27:46,250
I survived inspite
of everything.

189
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:52,458
I did not compromise
my independence.

190
00:27:53,916 --> 00:27:56,541
Now that I'm settling down...

191
00:27:57,541 --> 00:28:03,250
You suddenly appear.
Why, Rahul? I haven't done you any harm.

192
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:27,958
I don't want to argue with you.

193
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:31,666
Neither do I want
any explanations.

194
00:28:33,125 --> 00:28:36,541
All I want to say, is
that I'm scared.

195
00:28:38,833 --> 00:28:42,750
Then, listen to a story.
The tale of Alirajpur.

196
00:28:45,083 --> 00:28:47,708
I don’t know how true it is.

197
00:28:48,958 --> 00:28:51,583
Because stories travel
through word of mouth.

198
00:28:52,958 --> 00:28:56,750
Therefore, there are infinite
possibilities of narration.

199
00:28:59,583 --> 00:29:02,625
People go through
many experiences.

200
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:07,500
Happiness, sadness and
countless other emotions.

201
00:29:09,583 --> 00:29:12,833
Some experiences
are never forgotten.

202
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Others are lost forever.

203
00:29:18,791 --> 00:29:22,791
Occasionally, people even
forget familiar faces.

204
00:29:24,583 --> 00:29:28,958
A snake does not always
look like a snake.

205
00:29:30,208 --> 00:29:33,083
Can you be clearer?

206
00:29:34,125 --> 00:29:38,541
I mean...
Humans tend to fantasize...

207
00:29:39,458 --> 00:29:43,708
So the world is often colored
by the imagination.

208
00:29:46,166 --> 00:29:48,791
And a new world is born.

209
00:32:01,416 --> 00:32:06,666
That evening, we saw
smoke over Parul’s terrace.

210
00:32:09,291 --> 00:32:11,916
It was all over in
a few moments.

211
00:32:12,875 --> 00:32:15,541
And Parul was no more.

212
00:32:16,208 --> 00:32:20,041
There were rumors
started soon after.

213
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:25,000
Actually, she had
lost the will to live.

214
00:32:25,708 --> 00:32:29,250
She was worshipping the deity of
Madan-Mohan that evening.

215
00:32:29,958 --> 00:32:32,583
For the well-being
of her family.

216
00:32:33,041 --> 00:32:39,083
Since she was barren, she was
the object of her in-law's ire.

217
00:32:41,333 --> 00:32:42,958
She would often cry.

218
00:32:43,875 --> 00:32:46,166
And confide in me.

219
00:32:46,708 --> 00:32:49,375
I would reassure her.

220
00:32:49,916 --> 00:32:52,875
And share with her
my own unhappiness.

221
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:56,708
But she would not understand.
She was a straightforward girl.

222
00:32:57,541 --> 00:33:00,166
She really wanted to break free.

223
00:33:01,583 --> 00:33:04,250
And she did it that evening.

224
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:07,958
Her final romantic voyage.

225
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:13,291
A journey from the end
to eternity. Free forever.

226
00:33:14,875 --> 00:33:17,500
At last beyond any censure.

227
00:33:20,125 --> 00:33:23,583
That evening she
lit the oil lamp.

228
00:33:24,583 --> 00:33:28,833
To worship Lord Madan-Mohan.

229
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:33,458
Then set her sari alight
with the sacred flame.

230
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:37,416
And the fire engulfed, Parul.

231
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:45,708
It seemed as if she was
experiencing eternal peace.

232
00:33:46,541 --> 00:33:50,500
As if she had sacrificed
herself to the Gods.

233
00:33:52,375 --> 00:33:55,000
Soon it was all over.

234
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:58,833
She was gone forever.

235
00:34:01,166 --> 00:34:05,458
Her body was charred
beyond recognition.

236
00:34:06,875 --> 00:34:10,375
Then they did an autopsy
and what not.

237
00:35:39,791 --> 00:35:42,458
The insane are more
prone to fantasy.

238
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:45,958
There is an ancient legend.

239
00:35:47,041 --> 00:35:48,708
Part of an oral tradition.

240
00:35:49,583 --> 00:35:53,750
The insane would often
embark on sea voyages.

241
00:35:54,875 --> 00:35:57,541
In search of their lost sanity.

242
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,625
This was actually society's
ploy to get rid of the insane.

243
00:36:06,166 --> 00:36:10,041
However, the insane were
never a threat to society.

244
00:36:11,416 --> 00:36:16,083
Suddenly, the situation changed
after the 15th century.

245
00:36:17,083 --> 00:36:19,708
The insane were now imprisoned.

246
00:36:20,833 --> 00:36:24,041
And physically tortured
in the name of medicine.

247
00:36:25,166 --> 00:36:28,458
Doctors believed that
instead of blood...

248
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,625
foul fluid flowed in their bodies.

249
00:36:33,416 --> 00:36:36,250
This made men insane.

250
00:36:37,583 --> 00:36:40,250
Often, their skulls were punctured...

251
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:43,958
with iron spikes to
remove the foul fluid...

252
00:36:44,875 --> 00:36:48,541
and free the mad
of their insanity.

253
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:37,791
Aren't you going to school today?
- No.

254
00:37:38,958 --> 00:37:41,708
But you are not entitled
to any more leave.

255
00:37:42,166 --> 00:37:45,291
True, but I have
decided not to go.

256
00:37:46,625 --> 00:37:49,750
An unpaid leave.

257
00:37:51,208 --> 00:37:54,500
I just don't feel like going.

258
00:37:56,208 --> 00:37:58,916
Are you ill?
You can go to the doctor.

259
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,083
No. I am fine.

260
00:38:02,416 --> 00:38:05,750
What's wrong with you?
One thing is very clear...

261
00:38:07,333 --> 00:38:11,708
...since that man came,
you have changed.

262
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:17,125
You seem to be suffering.
What's wrong with you?

263
00:38:18,125 --> 00:38:22,500
Why don't you ask him to leave?
Why are you suffering?

264
00:38:23,125 --> 00:38:25,833
Softly!
Rahul is inside.

265
00:38:26,458 --> 00:38:29,916
Let him listen.
I don't care!

266
00:38:31,958 --> 00:38:34,666
I can't ask him to leave.

267
00:38:35,666 --> 00:38:40,166
Okay. If it is awkward for you,
I will ask him to leave.

268
00:38:41,416 --> 00:38:44,916
I can also tell him.
That is not the issue.

269
00:38:46,541 --> 00:38:49,250
There is another problem.
- What is the difficulty?

270
00:38:51,375 --> 00:38:54,625
Actually, I called him here.

271
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:58,625
How can I ask him to leave?

272
00:38:59,166 --> 00:39:01,875
What?
Are you crazy?

273
00:39:02,833 --> 00:39:06,375
Do you know him?
You have never left this city.

274
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:09,166
How will you know him?

275
00:39:09,625 --> 00:39:15,041
Where is Alirajpur?
He is lying. Just stories.

276
00:39:16,041 --> 00:39:19,541
There is no proof that
he knows my brother.

277
00:39:21,208 --> 00:39:24,625
It was a mistake to allow a
stranger into our home.

278
00:39:26,333 --> 00:39:28,416
You don't believe me?

279
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:31,875
One of you is lying.

280
00:39:32,958 --> 00:39:36,500
What does my brother look like?
Does he have a moustache or glasses?

281
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:40,208
Does that matter?

282
00:39:41,208 --> 00:39:44,083
Will it prove my honesty?

283
00:42:05,291 --> 00:42:09,916
I am prone to addiction.
But it does not make me abnormal.

284
00:42:10,875 --> 00:42:15,791
It's playing with nature.
Like hide & seek.

285
00:42:16,958 --> 00:42:19,458
It is ephemeral.

286
00:42:19,708 --> 00:42:23,833
This obsession gives me new visions.
But slowly burns me.

287
00:42:24,541 --> 00:42:27,291
Eccentric...
- It has to be controlled.

288
00:42:28,083 --> 00:42:31,541
Obsession has to be restricted.
- Like the Wall of China?

289
00:42:32,166 --> 00:42:36,500
Probably. Or nature and
perversion will collide.

290
00:42:38,625 --> 00:42:43,541
Everything is on the run.
As if the earth has been fragmented.

291
00:42:45,458 --> 00:42:48,166
Everything is relative.
Everything is chaotic.

292
00:42:50,333 --> 00:42:55,750
No one pays any attention.
No one cares. No one is bothered.

293
00:42:56,833 --> 00:43:00,333
Everyone is running
from one end to the other.

294
00:43:02,708 --> 00:43:06,541
Without knowing
why and where to.

295
00:43:08,208 --> 00:43:11,000
A farce.
A charade.

296
00:43:12,333 --> 00:43:15,041
Right, it's a mockery.

297
00:45:24,125 --> 00:45:27,541
No, I know him.
Whatever he is saying is true.

298
00:45:28,708 --> 00:45:35,791
Listen, if you repeat a lie a
number of times, it sounds true.

299
00:45:36,541 --> 00:45:39,958
And that's what he is doing.
This is a conspiracy.

300
00:45:40,708 --> 00:45:43,458
No, this is not a conspiracy.

301
00:45:44,833 --> 00:45:49,625
I have been setting a trap for
many years to catch this man.

302
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:57,541
Yes, I didn't know him.
But I knew I would trap him.

303
00:45:59,041 --> 00:46:01,958
I would patiently
wait every day.

304
00:46:03,625 --> 00:46:06,351
To catch him in my net.

305
00:46:06,375 --> 00:46:07,375
To catch him.

306
00:46:07,541 --> 00:46:12,500
You obviously remember that
I would ask you everyday...

307
00:46:13,375 --> 00:46:18,000
if there were any
letters for me.

308
00:46:20,208 --> 00:46:24,791
It was not from your brother but from
this man from whom I expected to hear.

309
00:46:26,041 --> 00:46:29,458
Stop this nonsense!
I have had enough.

310
00:46:30,541 --> 00:46:33,833
This house is cursed.
Everyone in this house is crazy.

311
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:37,958
First my brother
left this house.

312
00:46:38,958 --> 00:46:43,041
Then this stranger with his false
stories became an unwanted guest.

313
00:46:44,666 --> 00:46:48,166
And now you!
I will go crazy next.

314
00:46:49,708 --> 00:46:53,000
When you reach my age...

315
00:46:55,166 --> 00:46:58,458
you will go through
the same...

316
00:46:59,708 --> 00:47:03,375
Then you will
understand my pain.

317
00:47:06,375 --> 00:47:11,000
Nightmares are an
inevitable part of human existence.

318
00:48:50,291 --> 00:48:53,000
Devi, what were you
both talking about?

319
00:48:53,625 --> 00:48:56,958
About you. But, you
don't have to know.

320
00:48:58,416 --> 00:49:02,166
Finally, the two of you have
been talking about me.

321
00:49:03,875 --> 00:49:08,541
But the neighbors have been wagging
their tongues for a long time.

322
00:49:09,708 --> 00:49:12,458
I don’t care what they think.

323
00:49:13,541 --> 00:49:17,000
They don't feed us.
We are not dependent on them.

324
00:49:18,125 --> 00:49:22,000
That's bold indeed!
Such courage is necessary for survival.

325
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,708
But, I have decided to leave.

326
00:49:27,208 --> 00:49:32,708
I don’t want to create
any further trouble.

327
00:49:33,791 --> 00:49:37,333
I don't want your reputation
to suffer because of me.

328
00:49:38,666 --> 00:49:41,416
Who said you are
creating trouble?

329
00:49:42,375 --> 00:49:46,041
Remember, you haven't
come here of your own free will.

330
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,708
I have forced you to come here.

331
00:49:50,541 --> 00:49:53,250
You can't go.
It's impossible.

332
00:49:53,958 --> 00:49:56,666
But I don't want to stay here.

333
00:49:57,041 --> 00:49:59,750
I don't care what you want.

334
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:06,791
You have not come on
your own nor can you leave.

335
00:50:10,166 --> 00:50:13,916
But I must leave. The neighbors
have threatened me.

336
00:50:15,291 --> 00:50:18,000
Are you afraid of them?

337
00:51:13,958 --> 00:51:18,875
Who are you angry with? Me?

338
00:51:21,541 --> 00:51:25,416
Look here.
Can you ever be angry with me?

339
00:51:30,666 --> 00:51:35,791
Last night, I had a dream which I have
been trying to see for a long time.

340
00:51:37,291 --> 00:51:41,500
You remember that field, in
Alirajpur, behind our colony?

341
00:51:43,125 --> 00:51:47,375
I dreamt we were walking
and talking a lot.

342
00:51:49,291 --> 00:51:52,000
But I can't recall
much after that.

343
00:51:52,708 --> 00:51:57,916
Probably something very intimate,
and I was enjoying it.

344
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:01,500
I laughed a lot.

345
00:52:01,958 --> 00:52:05,541
And you threw peanuts
into my open mouth.

346
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:12,083
We walked hand in hand,
and spoke a lot.

347
00:52:14,041 --> 00:52:19,916
Although, we were all alone
I was suddenly very afraid.

348
00:52:20,916 --> 00:52:24,416
As if Madan was following us.

349
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:28,500
I told you to return.

350
00:52:30,958 --> 00:52:34,291
You embraced me to reassure me.

351
00:52:35,833 --> 00:52:39,041
You kissed the back of
my neck to comfort me.

352
00:52:40,291 --> 00:52:44,458
You tried your best
to cheer me up.

353
00:52:46,333 --> 00:52:48,833
Yet I was nervous.

354
00:52:49,625 --> 00:52:54,541
Suddenly, I broke free from your
embrace and started running.

355
00:52:56,375 --> 00:52:59,833
I ran endlessly along the familiar
road. But, I was afraid.

356
00:53:01,583 --> 00:53:04,333
And then I woke up exhausted.

357
00:53:06,208 --> 00:53:08,916
You have learned to
tell beautiful lies.

358
00:53:09,416 --> 00:53:14,291
No, why should I lie?
- I wonder why?

359
00:53:15,583 --> 00:53:19,041
The dream was true.
And it coincided with my wish.

360
00:53:21,541 --> 00:53:24,541
You have also made
up some stories.

361
00:53:26,125 --> 00:53:28,833
To prove that my
stories were lies.

362
00:53:29,541 --> 00:53:32,250
You are trying to
negate my lies with yours.

363
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:39,375
No. Just as your stories
are true, so are mine.

364
00:53:40,333 --> 00:53:43,125
And the truth cannot
remain hidden for long.

365
00:53:45,291 --> 00:53:48,000
How can this be possible?
You never lived in Alirajpur.

366
00:53:49,125 --> 00:53:51,833
No, I did live in Alirajpur.

367
00:53:52,416 --> 00:53:55,916
I stayed opposite to
your quarters.

368
00:53:56,791 --> 00:54:01,541
That was the beginning of
this relationship. Wasn't it?

369
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,916
There was a park
behind our house.

370
00:54:07,541 --> 00:54:12,000
To the left of it was a pond.
It was used for fishing sometimes.

371
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,708
The factory chimney would
spew out smoke.

372
00:54:19,625 --> 00:54:22,916
All the apartments in the
colony looked alike.

373
00:54:24,041 --> 00:54:26,750
Right?
- Yes, you are right.

374
00:54:28,041 --> 00:54:30,958
So doesn't this prove that
we both lived in Alirajpur?

375
00:54:32,041 --> 00:54:34,958
And obviously we
had a relationship?

376
00:54:36,208 --> 00:54:38,916
No, No. How is
that possible?

377
00:54:39,416 --> 00:54:42,125
But you just said
that I was right.

378
00:54:43,458 --> 00:54:46,666
I can't make sense of it all.
I am confused!

379
00:54:47,541 --> 00:54:50,291
Okay.
Let me elaborate.

380
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,916
Madan and I lived in Alirajpur
for nearly three and half years.

381
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:57,833
In that yellow house
opposite yours.

382
00:55:00,416 --> 00:55:04,458
I loved Madan and
fought with him too.

383
00:55:06,125 --> 00:55:09,291
And then I left him one day.

384
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:13,750
I could not stay with him.

385
00:55:14,208 --> 00:55:16,916
Madan made my life bitter.

386
00:55:19,291 --> 00:55:23,083
Sometimes I think,
if not for you...

387
00:55:24,458 --> 00:55:27,166
…my relationship with Madan
would not have soured.

388
00:55:29,666 --> 00:55:32,416
When Madan had his night duty.

389
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,916
You would stare at our bedroom
with a cigarette in hand.

390
00:55:40,875 --> 00:55:43,583
You seemed to be
probing and prying.

391
00:55:44,708 --> 00:55:47,458
You used to scare me.

392
00:55:49,541 --> 00:55:53,666
I also knew you were
sleeping with your maid.

393
00:55:54,541 --> 00:55:57,291
I was disgusted by you.

394
00:55:57,958 --> 00:56:02,208
Then, I don’t know what happened,
but I started liking you.

395
00:56:04,291 --> 00:56:07,291
I was so obsessed with you that…

396
00:56:08,125 --> 00:56:11,416
I even knew the color
of your clothes.

397
00:56:12,541 --> 00:56:15,250
I was desperate to talk to you.

398
00:56:16,333 --> 00:56:19,041
And one day I did that too.

399
00:56:19,708 --> 00:56:21,958
You really can attract women.

400
00:56:23,916 --> 00:56:28,125
You have a mysterious smile.
Almost, always.

401
00:56:29,541 --> 00:56:35,750
That forces women to
become attracted to you.

402
00:57:40,666 --> 00:57:44,166
What are you doing, Devi?

403
00:57:45,625 --> 00:57:48,375
Don't call me Devi.

404
00:57:50,291 --> 00:57:54,750
Call me by the name
you gave me - Rati.

405
00:57:58,083 --> 00:58:05,541
It definitely suited me.
Both as Madan’s wife and your chosen one.

406
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:11,958
These are all stories.

407
00:58:12,833 --> 00:58:14,541
Yours...

408
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,916
Mine...

409
00:58:17,416 --> 00:58:19,125
Alirajpur's...

410
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,708
Bagh Bazzar's...

411
00:58:22,166 --> 00:58:23,541
Shyam Bazzar's...

412
00:58:23,916 --> 00:58:25,625
Sova Bazzar's...

413
00:58:27,208 --> 00:58:30,125
And the rest of the world.

414
00:58:33,166 --> 00:58:36,083
But... Madan?

415
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,916
Poor Madan.

416
00:58:45,583 --> 00:58:48,541
He didn’t suspect a thing.

417
00:58:52,541 --> 00:58:56,791
You became one
of us so skillfully.

418
00:58:59,250 --> 00:59:03,708
Nobody realized
your real motive.

419
00:59:06,291 --> 00:59:09,208
And, most amazingly...

420
00:59:10,958 --> 00:59:13,875
he even asked you
to take care of me.

421
00:59:15,458 --> 00:59:19,708
You were waiting
for this opportunity.

422
00:59:20,625 --> 00:59:23,958
That's nonsense.

423
00:59:27,583 --> 00:59:33,125
I know my physical relationship
with Madan made you jealous.

424
00:59:34,666 --> 00:59:38,083
But I was his wife.

425
00:59:39,625 --> 00:59:42,541
The physical relationship
was natural.

426
00:59:43,916 --> 00:59:47,708
Your hands were tied.
This made you envious.

427
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,541
But… I was…

428
00:59:54,583 --> 00:59:57,541
You will probably say...

429
01:00:02,250 --> 01:00:05,875
That we did not share any
kind of physical relationship.

430
01:00:07,541 --> 01:00:13,041
That, was my biggest failure.

431
01:00:16,125 --> 01:00:19,041
If that had happened...

432
01:00:20,791 --> 01:00:25,291
I could have declared to the
world that you were mine.

433
01:00:26,833 --> 01:00:30,208
But that did not happen.
- Stop it!

434
01:00:34,208 --> 01:00:36,750
Why should I stop?

435
01:00:38,125 --> 01:00:40,416
I want to know...

436
01:00:40,750 --> 01:00:43,666
Why couldn't you make
my body and soul yours?

437
01:00:45,333 --> 01:00:48,333
That satisfied you so much.

438
01:00:50,541 --> 01:00:53,916
Why did you destroy my life? Why?

439
01:00:59,291 --> 01:01:05,666
Devi, I have told you earlier
and I am saying it again.

440
01:01:10,916 --> 01:01:13,833
I love you.

441
01:01:15,791 --> 01:01:18,708
For the sake of loving you.

442
01:01:21,250 --> 01:01:24,166
For the sheer pleasure
of loving you.

443
01:01:27,125 --> 01:01:30,541
It is a different
kind of emotion.

444
01:01:35,250 --> 01:01:38,166
You will not understand.

445
01:02:00,125 --> 01:02:03,791
He lived across
from us in Alirajpur.

446
01:02:05,708 --> 01:02:08,625
When your brother
had night duty...

447
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:14,125
he would stare at my
bedroom from his window.

448
01:02:17,375 --> 01:02:21,875
Unknown to your brother
we went on seeing each other.

449
01:02:24,625 --> 01:02:28,541
Then we grew to like each other.

450
01:02:29,791 --> 01:02:34,416
It's difficult to explain why.

451
01:02:37,791 --> 01:02:40,291
I fell in love with him.

452
01:02:41,250 --> 01:02:48,125
But sister-in-law, since your marriage
you have never left this city…

453
01:02:48,708 --> 01:02:51,625
how did you invent
these stories?

454
01:02:52,416 --> 01:02:56,625
I came back, but no one
came looking for me.

455
01:02:58,666 --> 01:03:03,833
I waited everyday
for someone to come.

456
01:03:07,875 --> 01:03:12,791
I then stared to create
a magical trap.

457
01:05:31,375 --> 01:05:33,708
There he comes.

458
01:05:34,541 --> 01:05:37,000
The way I wanted.

459
01:05:38,166 --> 01:05:42,041
I should be prepared
to welcome him.

460
01:05:43,375 --> 01:05:46,500
What sort of a reception
does he expect from me?

461
01:05:47,375 --> 01:05:51,208
Someone totally exhausted,
like a vagabond.

462
01:05:52,750 --> 01:05:56,208
Does he expect me to
rush into his waiting arms?

463
01:05:57,416 --> 01:05:59,875
No, I don't know
why I called him.

464
01:06:00,333 --> 01:06:02,791
The reasons are hazy.

465
01:06:03,208 --> 01:06:06,500
But, since I have summoned him,
I have to honor him.

466
01:06:07,916 --> 01:06:12,083
He is a symbol of my fecundity.
He is within me.

467
01:06:12,833 --> 01:06:19,041
I have created him by
invoking Vedic rituals.

468
01:06:20,250 --> 01:06:22,708
He is like Lord Rama.

469
01:06:23,208 --> 01:06:26,458
With a turban hemmed
with golden thread.

470
01:06:27,125 --> 01:06:32,750
Diamond earrings, leather shoes,
and silken robes.

471
01:06:33,791 --> 01:06:38,000
Riding a heavenly chariot
to fetch his princess.

472
01:06:39,541 --> 01:06:43,166
Let's stop this fantasy.
A familiar face is better.

473
01:06:44,708 --> 01:06:50,000
A bearded face,
wheat colored skin.

474
01:06:51,208 --> 01:06:54,125
Strong arms and powerful hands.

475
01:06:54,416 --> 01:06:58,000
To embrace his woman with ease.

476
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,500
That's why, I have called him...

477
01:07:02,208 --> 01:07:03,666
There he comes...

478
01:10:08,291 --> 01:10:11,541
There is quicksand
somewhere around here.

479
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:15,875
But no one knows where it is.

480
01:10:16,791 --> 01:10:20,583
However, its existence is a fact.

481
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:26,333
That seems scary.

482
01:10:27,125 --> 01:10:29,625
And no one knows has
a clue where it is.

483
01:10:31,166 --> 01:10:33,708
Although, the quicksand is here.

484
01:10:35,208 --> 01:10:37,708
It is a deathtrap.

485
01:10:38,875 --> 01:10:42,500
But how do you know it's here?

486
01:10:44,833 --> 01:10:51,750
Every couple of years
people disappear from here.

487
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:55,000
Nobody finds them.

488
01:10:56,291 --> 01:10:59,916
Then people say that the
quicksand has devoured them.

489
01:11:01,166 --> 01:11:04,625
Does everybody here
end up the same way?

490
01:11:06,083 --> 01:11:08,916
No. This place is
not meant for all.

491
01:11:10,041 --> 01:11:12,916
This is not the best way to die.

492
01:11:14,666 --> 01:11:18,333
No. This indeed is the best way to die.
- Why?

493
01:11:19,708 --> 01:11:27,708
The victim puts one foot forward
and then the second.

494
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:36,875
Gradually, he drowns
into the sand.

495
01:11:39,416 --> 01:11:43,500
Struggling to survive,
without any success.

496
01:11:45,958 --> 01:11:48,500
The open sky above...

497
01:11:50,083 --> 01:11:53,583
and the shifting ground below.

498
01:11:56,375 --> 01:12:03,333
Earth transforms into
an infinitesimal point.

499
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:09,708
He will desperately want
to live, screaming…

500
01:12:11,208 --> 01:12:13,708
until he dies.

501
01:12:14,833 --> 01:12:19,791
But no voice can be heard
from such depths.

502
01:12:20,916 --> 01:12:25,708
No one can find him.
- Finally, death.

503
01:12:26,291 --> 01:12:28,791
For both.
- What do you mean?

504
01:12:29,833 --> 01:12:36,625
Only couples die here.
Or those sepearted at birth.

505
01:12:36,916 --> 01:12:40,375
This is frightening.

506
01:12:41,541 --> 01:12:44,208
This area should be
found and cordoned off.

507
01:12:45,583 --> 01:12:48,875
Don't be afraid.
Nothing will happen to you.

508
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:56,708
You will not fall.
Even if you run around at night.

509
01:12:57,750 --> 01:13:00,291
As long as I am with you.

510
01:13:03,833 --> 01:13:08,000
If you fall, I will too.
- No.

511
01:13:08,958 --> 01:13:12,791
How can you be so sure?
- I know I will.

512
01:13:14,916 --> 01:13:19,833
I can't explain it.

513
01:13:23,250 --> 01:13:28,416
It is my intuition.

514
01:13:31,958 --> 01:13:36,000
Will you have to stay
like this with me?

515
01:13:38,125 --> 01:13:41,375
I am happy that you have
finally understood this.

516
01:13:42,833 --> 01:13:46,291
But this too is impossible.
- Why?

517
01:13:47,666 --> 01:13:52,291
It will be unjust. Wrong for both of us.
- Why?

518
01:13:53,208 --> 01:14:00,291
It is not possible for two people
to watch over one another forever.

519
01:14:02,958 --> 01:14:07,416
Rahul, will you tell me something?

520
01:14:09,041 --> 01:14:13,125
Do you love me?
- Yes.

521
01:14:15,291 --> 01:14:18,500
Will you do me two favors?
- I would even do three.

522
01:14:19,125 --> 01:14:21,625
Two is fine.

523
01:14:23,875 --> 01:14:26,416
Firstly, remember...

524
01:14:28,583 --> 01:14:32,708
I am grateful that you came here.

525
01:14:34,333 --> 01:14:37,916
I will come again.

526
01:14:39,916 --> 01:14:43,416
Secondly, don't ever forget me.

527
01:14:45,083 --> 01:14:47,583
The way we are walking today.

528
01:14:48,208 --> 01:14:50,708
Hand in hand... everything.

529
01:14:51,166 --> 01:14:54,083
Yes, I will never forget this.
I give my word.

530
01:16:09,250 --> 01:16:11,625
Barely five minutes had passed...

531
01:16:13,375 --> 01:16:17,583
Mother had just put me to sleep
and gone to father’s room.

532
01:16:19,416 --> 01:16:23,958
I remember it was a Sunday afternoon,
father was at home.

533
01:16:24,750 --> 01:16:29,625
Usually mother would go to
his room every night.

534
01:16:31,083 --> 01:16:33,458
Father slept in a separate room.

535
01:16:35,416 --> 01:16:39,208
That day mother had been feverish
since that afternoon.

536
01:16:40,625 --> 01:16:44,833
They had quarrelled the day before.

537
01:16:46,791 --> 01:16:52,250
So she did not go to father's room.
Instead she fell asleep by my side.

538
01:16:54,083 --> 01:16:58,916
After some time father came and
dragged mother into his room.

539
01:17:01,083 --> 01:17:03,416
They quarrelled again.

540
01:17:03,958 --> 01:17:06,333
Father... battered my mother.

541
01:17:07,833 --> 01:17:10,166
Next day, it was the same story.

542
01:17:11,208 --> 01:17:16,875
I don't know why...
I was terrified. I even cried.

543
01:17:18,458 --> 01:17:20,750
I think... I wet my pants.

544
01:17:21,416 --> 01:17:23,708
In fear, I was banging on his door.

545
01:17:25,041 --> 01:17:27,416
Screaming out for my mother.

546
01:17:28,125 --> 01:17:32,041
After a while father came out.

547
01:17:33,833 --> 01:17:38,625
He took me in his lap and burnt my
thigh with a smoldering cigarette.

548
01:17:39,833 --> 01:17:42,666
I screamed in agony.

549
01:17:43,375 --> 01:17:45,916
I was in extreme pain.

550
01:17:47,041 --> 01:17:49,583
I was shell-shocked.

551
01:17:51,166 --> 01:17:56,250
My head stopped working.
I did not try to run away.

552
01:17:57,125 --> 01:18:00,041
I was aghast.

553
01:18:01,083 --> 01:18:05,041
Then, father dragged me
into the bathroom.

554
01:18:06,125 --> 01:18:10,291
He held my face down
in a bucket of water.

555
01:18:11,666 --> 01:18:15,375
I nearly choked to death.

556
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,416
Mother tried to rescue me.

557
01:18:20,541 --> 01:18:22,916
But was unsuccessful.

558
01:18:24,416 --> 01:18:26,791
She screamed for help.

559
01:18:28,625 --> 01:18:30,333
I don’t remember anything after that.

560
01:18:31,291 --> 01:18:33,166
When I regained consciousness...

561
01:18:33,833 --> 01:18:37,250
I was on the neighbor's
bed by my mother's side.
