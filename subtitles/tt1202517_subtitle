1
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:21,938
Hey run!

2
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:33,950
Come on!

3
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:15,458
That idiot is making us run!

4
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:19,462
Mangal, look there.

5
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,067
Hey you! Go this way.

6
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:26,469
That rogue must be
somewhere around here.

7
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:17,987
l had warned this fool..

8
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:20,126
..never to set foot
in the village again.

9
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,058
But he returned.

10
00:03:28,641 --> 00:03:29,665
Now if you disobey us..

11
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:31,141
..we'll have to do
all this with him.

12
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,141
lt is the matter of respect.

13
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,484
Of course! Even an ant dare
not enter this village..

14
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:42,953
..without our permission.

15
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:46,689
This dirty rat walks right
in like a guest of honour.

16
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:52,160
Well then.. let's do it.

17
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:53,889
What?

18
00:03:55,134 --> 00:04:00,834
Oh yes! But where will
we throw his dead body?

19
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:06,907
What are these kilns here for?

20
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,711
They are to perform
the funeral rites.

21
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:17,780
Come on!

22
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:19,715
Oops!

23
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:32,530
Take this! Andthis!
- Help!

24
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:37,600
Nice story! Excellent!

25
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,738
l am sure you enjoyed narrating it.

26
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:41,209
l enjoyed hearing it too.

27
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:43,539
Priest.
- Yes.

28
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,550
But there is just one tiny hitch.

29
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,550
For this story to come true..

30
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:51,556
..it is very important for
Kedar Shukla to be alive.

31
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:52,682
Yes, it's me here.

32
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:53,884
But this man says he
himself is Kedar Shukla.

33
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:55,551
Hey, how can he be Kedar Shukla?

34
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:56,686
Kedar Shukla is dead!

35
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:57,820
Hey but..

36
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:58,954
No! No! No! l am not sayingthis.

37
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:00,555
This document clearly states..

38
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:02,100
..that Kedar Shukla is no more.

39
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:03,959
But listen..
- You listen.

40
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,833
Priest, please read it out to him.

41
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,642
'Kedar Shukla,
resident of Den Kasba..'

42
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:13,769
'Village Rajpur, aged 48..'

43
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:18,781
'..diedat 4:20pm
of a heart attack..'

44
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:20,785
'..on 12th August, 1994.'

45
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:22,252
Priest, enough! Enough!

46
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:23,583
Are you planning on
recitingthe entire Ramayan?

47
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:24,850
Listen! Listen brother.

48
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:25,981
Now you listen to me.

49
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:27,582
Look here at the doctor's seal.

50
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:28,991
Here is the official's signature.

51
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:31,655
Andthis here, some brother
of yours, Devendra Shukla..

52
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:32,788
Yes.. it wasall his..

53
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:33,923
No, this is his signature.

54
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:36,599
So we should believe you or..

55
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:37,727
..this government document?

56
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:38,861
Just tell me this.

57
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:40,598
We are government officials.

58
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:42,607
So we'll trust
government document, right?

59
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:48,013
Listen Mr. Shukla,
moral of the story is this..

60
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:51,614
..for us, l mean
for this government..

61
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:53,876
..you have left for
your heavenly abode.

62
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:55,613
May your soul rest in peace.

63
00:05:58,057 --> 00:05:59,615
Did your brothers leave you any..

64
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:00,954
..property or did they take it all?

65
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:04,155
Priest, these are modern times.

66
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:05,696
Who leavesanythingfor anyone?

67
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:28,043
Hey just coming, pal.

68
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:29,178
Wait a second!

69
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,715
What were you doing inside so long?

70
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:35,657
l was doing what others
normally do in a toilet, brother!

71
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,662
Do you do something else there?

72
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:38,788
Oh! Oh no!

73
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:49,331
Hey!

74
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,678
Hey, what are you doing?

75
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,804
ls this the time
to wash your hands?

76
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,006
Yes? Come on, enough now.
Stop it.

77
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:57,207
Oh no! Get lost.. dirty boy.

78
00:06:57,316 --> 00:07:00,683
Hey hero.. why are you
trying to hide from me?

79
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:04,689
Hiding my face? Me? Huh!
Are you crazy?

80
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:05,815
What's the matter?

81
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:06,949
These days you don't
pay any attention to me.

82
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:08,890
Nonsense! Today you are
really looking mind-blowing!

83
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:10,019
Am l shining?

84
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:11,892
Or are you tryingto
put the shine on me?

85
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:13,226
When will you return my money?

86
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:14,697
l will give it, dear.

87
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:15,893
You've been sayingthis
since the last two months.

88
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:17,902
There my father is
harassing me a lot.

89
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:20,103
l made a mistake
by lending you money.

90
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:23,234
Can't you even
handle your father for me?

91
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,301
No!

92
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:28,103
All right. l'll give
you the money next month.

93
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:29,238
Your next month never arrives.

94
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:30,909
Hey, it will arrive next month.

95
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,717
Not only will l clear your loan..

96
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,252
..l'll also take you for a movie..

97
00:07:35,154 --> 00:07:36,314
..at a multiplex.

98
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:39,122
So you'll show me a
movie in multiplex? - Yes.

99
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:40,916
Are you telling me the truth?

100
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:42,051
Have l ever liedto you?

101
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:44,925
Wretched rogue! You
lie to me everytime.

102
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:46,055
But this time if you lie..

103
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:47,257
..l'll reshape your face, just see.

104
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:48,390
Hey, l promise l'll return it.

105
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:49,729
Anda movie at a multiplex too.

106
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:50,860
Hey that too, darling!

107
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:51,994
Now happy?

108
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:53,128
Come on. Move aside.

109
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:00,803
Hey, Yadav!

110
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,755
Yadav! Hey Yadav, get up!

111
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:12,147
Give me some money please.

112
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:23,893
Rs.50! Wow!

113
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:27,830
Coming.

114
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:32,835
Good morning, brother Shukla.

115
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,303
One second.

116
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,372
Shall we leave?
- Yes.

117
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:59,330
Okay Mr. Nitin, tell me one thing.
- Yes?

118
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:03,000
This is just a green cauliflower.

119
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:05,470
But it is called broccoli.

120
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:07,870
Why so?

121
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:11,006
Why did your father name you Aman?

122
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:16,211
l don't know. l'll have to ask him.

123
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,017
Pal, even l'll have to ask.

124
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:20,349
Whom?

125
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:22,217
Broccoli's father!

126
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:24,819
Oh! You mean the cauliflower.

127
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:29,363
Hey Aman, your espresso is here.

128
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:30,901
She is calling you.

129
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:32,830
Aman! Aman!

130
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:37,840
Hey Aman!
- Yes, tell me.

131
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:39,904
See whether she has any friend.

132
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:41,372
Make my settingtoo, pal!

133
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,514
Have you ever seen
your face in mirror?

134
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:45,841
Come on. Go and clean the dishes.

135
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:48,045
Hey, now l am making coffee.

136
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:49,917
l've been promoted, understood?

137
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:52,388
And pal, you better be careful.

138
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:53,983
Many a royal ship have sunk..

139
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,254
..tryingto cross this depth.

140
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:58,386
And you are just an ordinary waiter.

141
00:09:58,497 --> 00:10:00,192
Hey, you give advice
accordingto your size.

142
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:02,057
Come on. Go and clean the plates.

143
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:04,864
l've been promotedto making coffee.

144
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:05,995
And he still tells me
to clean the plates.

145
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:16,071
Hello, ma'am Kate.

146
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:18,273
Hi Aman!

147
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:20,209
No studs today?

148
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:24,882
Oh! What will you have today?

149
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:30,219

Hey, very good Hindi, madam.

153
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:44,907
No, no, you are excellent. Sorry.

154
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:46,035
What a beauty, pal!

155
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:51,243
Aman! Aman!

156
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:52,374

Order for table 3.

158
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:05,320
For those two guys?
- Yes.

159
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:11,460
Hey, what are you doing?

160
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:12,594

Especially for them!

161

-Thank you.

163
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:23,072
Want me to serve it?
- No, thank you.

164
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:29,080
Mrs. Sharma says she would
wear the same diamond jewellery.

165
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,013
Hey it was wonderful!

166
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:34,155
So peaceful! So calm!

167
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,352
ljust can't explain it to you.

168
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:37,019
At the Retreat.

169
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:39,488
Really?

170
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,357
Oh no! Don't worry.

171
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:43,492
l'll do one thing.

172
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:44,626

You'll feel much better.

Thanks. And how is Anoop?

175
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:52,034
Mr. Anoop is busy as usual.

176
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:54,169
My driver knows his
schedule better than me.

177
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,043
Where he goes, why he goes.. etc

178
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:01,182
Stupid! Can't you drive carefully?

179
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:03,045
These wild beasts!

180
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:04,179
They find just my
car to die in front of!

181
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,314
Give me my phone.

182
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:06,516
What are you staringat?

183
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:07,649

00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:16,769
Only because of you all!

284
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,240

00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:33,651
Else, l'll smash
your face, understood?

293
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:35,323
Learn to be silent. Shut up!

294

Why are you bothering, brother?

302
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:46,655
Come on, play now.

303
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:48,392
Hey, l am not capable of
learning driving, pal.

304
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:52,329
Then you'll remain a
watchman all your life!

305
00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:54,666
We can't do anythingabout you.

306

Not cat, Kate.

313
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,757
Ooh! Wow! That foreigner?

314
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:20,560
Yes! She has gone bonkers over me.

315
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:23,428

318
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:29,904
Concentrate on your turn, pal.

319
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:31,635
You'll complain later
that you lost the game.

320
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:32,767
Tell me.

321
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,380
She said she wants to
see a movie with me.

322
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:37,506
Shut up, rogue!

323
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,910
She must've said
something else in English.

324
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:41,918
Right? And he feels
she wants to see a movie.

325
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,453
Hey, l am not like you.

326

327
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:49,658

What do you mean, pal?

329
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:55,392
Will that foreigner marry a waiter?

330
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:56,525
Yes! Yes! Why not?

331
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:57,659
Why would she, pal?

332
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,461
Hey pal! You don't read newspaper!

333
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:01,596

00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:05,804
Nowadays they love these drivers,
waiters, guides etc.

335
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:07,669
Really?

336
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:09,411
They not only fall in love..

337
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:10,948
..but also settle down with them.

338
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:17,419
Well.. even l'm going to

The best you can get!

343
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,434
They've just got

344
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:31,826
You want it?

345

Constipated!

351
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:58,463
Stomach not clearing
well everyday, you know.

352
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:01,657
Oh no! All the time
sounds erupt from inside.

353
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:03,132
Purr.. purr..

354
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:06,528
That Monty had come..

355
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:07,662

356
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:09,866

That Monty fellow, you know.

No good! Not even asking
for cutlets.

362
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,487
So many wasted.

363
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:25,547

l can't understand what to do.

426
00:24:33,505 --> 00:24:34,733
What does the doctor say?

427
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:36,740
He is saying it's typhoid.

428
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:38,398
He needs to be taken to
the city for some tests.

Why not, dear?

438
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:04,798

lsn't Rs.5 too much
just to receive the call?

444
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:29,851
You think it's too much?

445
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:30,985
Then go elsewhere and
take your calls.

446
00:25:32,964 --> 00:25:37,799
Okay listen.. does my
hero saysanything about me?

447

He must be saying something.

Oh, come on!
Who'll steal the petrol?

Why don't you ask him?

He is your main person.

455
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:03,959
At least he should know.

00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,829
Oh, you too..

Hey wait! Don't call me darling!

00:26:28,954 --> 00:26:29,978
Don't pamper him so much.

They should be restrictedto their
position. - Please talk softly.

00:31:26,918 --> 00:31:30,547
Last time, the guy
disappeared with the money.

Look, look. - My child is ill,
sir. lt's getting very difficult.

593
00:31:37,862 --> 00:31:40,558
Last time, his wife was ill.

594
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,222
Get it? Now leave.

595
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:44,634
Hey kill it! Kill it!

00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:55,803
Hi Yadav.

600
00:31:57,715 --> 00:32:01,242
Sir, my child is really ill.
l need some money.

601
00:32:01,352 --> 00:32:05,914
Yadav, the thing is that
l'm a little broke right now.

602
00:32:07,892 --> 00:32:08,916
Take this.

603
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:12,787
Take it. lt'll help.

604
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:21,262
Lali..

605
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:33,940
l'm sending it.
l've spoken to people.

606
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:40,219
They live in flats
that cost Rs.10 million

607
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,625
And they can't spare Rs.500 for me!

608
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:50,229
l'm not beggingfor alms,
just a loan l'll repay.

609
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:57,702
l've seen them spend
Rs.2000 on a meal.

610
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:02,707
Andthat rogue Kulkarni..

611
00:33:04,882 --> 00:33:08,318
l stayed night after night at
the hospital when his wife was ill.

612
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,249
All day l did my
dutiesat the building.

613
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:12,914
All night, l wasat the hospital..

614
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:16,460
..bringing medicines, food..
paying bills.. Everything.

615
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:23,267
But when l need something,
he acts like..

616
00:33:23,368 --> 00:33:27,270
..like l want the money for booze!

617
00:33:27,705 --> 00:33:31,266
My child is ill. All l'm asking
for isa loan that l'll repay.

618
00:33:36,981 --> 00:33:40,007
Mr. Shukla why are people like this?

619
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:44,288
They only feel their own pain,
not other people's.

620
00:33:57,068 --> 00:33:59,696
They drive in cars
that cost Rs.1.2 million.

621
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:09,046
But they can't give the
Rs.200 or Rs.400that l ask for.

622
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:54,352
l really don't have money.

623
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:26,115
l can't come to work.
l'm really ill today.

624
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:28,921
Come on, handle the boss for me.

625
00:35:29,827 --> 00:35:31,727
Okay, see you tomorrow.

626
00:35:32,897 --> 00:35:33,921
Hero..

627
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:35,524
Who were you fooling?

628
00:35:36,033 --> 00:35:38,729
What?
- Who were you fooling?

629
00:35:38,936 --> 00:35:41,404
What fooling? l'm really ill.

630
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:43,404
You don't look ill.

631
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:45,742
lnside. l'm ill inside.

632
00:35:46,777 --> 00:35:47,801
What do you know?

633
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:50,141
Yeah, l don't know much.

634
00:35:50,915 --> 00:35:54,009
Today is the 4th.

635
00:35:54,185 --> 00:35:56,016
Really? So?

636
00:35:56,187 --> 00:35:59,156
Where's my money?
- Oh that!

637
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:01,749
l'll get my salary tomorrow.
l'll pay you then.

638
00:36:02,126 --> 00:36:03,616
And my multiplex movie?

639
00:36:04,128 --> 00:36:07,427
That too. Why so stressed?

640
00:36:10,468 --> 00:36:13,437
Take this. l'm not well,
so l better get some sleep.

641
00:36:14,872 --> 00:36:17,432
Hey! Who pays for the call?

642
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:18,566
l'll pay everything tomorrow.

643
00:36:19,076 --> 00:36:20,839

Actually, it'll be a huge help.

Lovely area, isn't it. Mr. Shukla?

649
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:56,146
Maybe we'll move here
after we get married.

650
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:07,088
Hi, Kate ma'am!
- Hi!

651

What do l do with him?

698
00:42:18,102 --> 00:42:19,126
Mr. Shukla.

699
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:24,538
l think there'sa strong connection
between being rich and being stupid.

700
00:42:26,243 --> 00:42:28,871
Today, duringthe
interval l went to buy popcorn.

701
00:42:30,114 --> 00:42:32,548
They were selling a Rs.2 item..

702
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:34,408
..for Rs.60.

703
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:40,083
lt's very easy to
fool the rich, isn't it?

704
00:42:44,528 --> 00:42:49,363
Mr. Shukla, today you won my heart.

00:42:52,603 --> 00:42:54,833

717
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:05,566
You've dragged us
into your mess now!

718
00:45:06,403 --> 00:45:09,099
What else could l do?
He was hurt so l thought..

719
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:14,166
You're goingto jail!

720
00:45:14,278 --> 00:45:15,973
Do you want to take us with you?

721
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,107
Why do you keep repeatingthat?

722
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:19,375
l'm scared too.

723
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:23,313
My child is sick in the village..
My wife can't stop crying..

724
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:26,321
What can we do about that?
Should we go to jail for you?

725
00:45:38,035 --> 00:45:40,060
Don't worry. Nothing
will happen to him.

726
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:43,533
You could complain to the police.

727
00:45:44,308 --> 00:45:47,004
We could, but l'm scared.

728
00:45:47,111 --> 00:45:49,204
And you should be. lsn't it?

729
00:45:50,314 --> 00:45:53,078
You know him. What if
he's done something?

730
00:45:53,717 --> 00:45:55,275
And he gets in trouble
because we complain?

731
00:45:56,453 --> 00:46:28,552
Definitely no police.

732
00:46:28,552 --> 00:46:31,043
We could call his home
and tell them..

733
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:33,453
..we found him
unconscious on the road.

734
00:46:33,557 --> 00:46:36,390
And you think they'll believe you?

735
00:46:38,495 --> 00:46:41,191
He won't tell them
what you did to him?

736
00:46:41,431 --> 00:46:43,126
No, what we didto him?

737
00:46:46,503 --> 00:46:49,131
We're don for!
We're definitely goingto jail!

738
00:47:00,717 --> 00:47:02,742
What if we leave him
somewhere on the road?

739
00:47:02,853 --> 00:47:07,290
He's blindfolded and doesn't
even know where he is. Right?

740
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:15,095
l guess he's right.

741
00:47:17,868 --> 00:47:19,563
Hello son, where are you?

742
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:25,365
Who are you?

743
00:47:44,294 --> 00:47:47,320
Water.. Water..

744
00:47:50,234 --> 00:47:52,202
Do you think Yadav has run away?

745
00:47:57,241 --> 00:48:00,335
lt's been six hours.
Mr. Shukla, what do we do now?

746
00:48:07,918 --> 00:48:09,613
Who is it?
- lt's me.

747
00:48:15,926 --> 00:48:18,622
Where have you been all day
after getting us into this mess?

748
00:48:19,329 --> 00:48:22,355
l was organising
stuff to drop him off.

749
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:24,561
This is chloroform.

750
00:48:27,871 --> 00:48:31,238
l also got a vehicle.
Afriend of mine drives a taxi.

751
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:38,779
l can't drive..
Else l'd drop him off myself.

752
00:49:37,341 --> 00:49:39,707
Hello? Lokhandwala.

753
00:49:45,615 --> 00:49:46,639
Chicken.

754
00:49:57,694 --> 00:50:01,858
You call for me, then disappear?
- What?

755
00:50:02,432 --> 00:50:03,456
l'm coming from your room.

756
00:50:04,434 --> 00:50:06,265
l'll return your money.
Now let me go.

757
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:09,931
Oh hero! You're in a
mood for jokes today!

758
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,801
Hey tell me, when did
you win the lottery?

759
00:50:13,377 --> 00:50:15,811
You pay off the loan
and give an advance?

760
00:50:16,046 --> 00:50:17,741
Have you gone crazy?

761
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:19,873
Where did this come from?

762
00:50:19,983 --> 00:50:21,473
How do l know?

763
00:50:21,585 --> 00:50:25,282
Oh Salman! What acting!

764
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:29,281
Didn't you tell
Yadav to give it to me?

765
00:50:29,393 --> 00:50:31,418
What? Me?

766
00:50:32,062 --> 00:50:33,290
Oh l get it!

767
00:50:33,397 --> 00:50:35,297
Now that it's time to
take me to the multiplex..

768
00:50:35,399 --> 00:50:36,423
..you start this drama.

769
00:50:37,801 --> 00:50:38,825
Moron!

770
00:51:00,357 --> 00:51:01,381
What'sall this?

771
00:51:04,027 --> 00:51:05,324
You share.

772
00:51:05,695 --> 00:51:07,390
Share? Of what?

773
00:51:24,848 --> 00:51:26,475
Your son is with us.

774
00:51:28,852 --> 00:51:29,876
Hello? Who is this?

775
00:51:30,387 --> 00:51:34,414
Listen, we didn't take him..
What do you want?

776
00:51:35,459 --> 00:51:36,483
Who are you?

777
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:38,561
Listen to me.. Please don't do
anything to my son.

778
00:51:38,662 --> 00:51:40,493
He's my daughter's husband.

779
00:51:41,465 --> 00:51:42,557
She's pregnant.

780
00:51:42,666 --> 00:51:44,429
And she's really bad right now.

781
00:51:45,001 --> 00:51:46,764
l'll give you whatever you want.
Just don't harm him.

782
00:52:19,569 --> 00:52:20,593
Thirty thousand rupees.

783
00:52:22,906 --> 00:52:23,930
And my son?

784
00:52:25,709 --> 00:52:27,540
We'll let him go as
soon as we get the money.

785
00:52:29,513 --> 00:52:33,950
lf l pay first, how do
l know you'll let him go?

786
00:52:38,455 --> 00:52:41,424
Do you have a better method?

787
00:52:42,726 --> 00:52:44,091
You want your son, don't you?

788
00:52:44,728 --> 00:52:45,752
8:00am.

789
00:52:46,196 --> 00:52:48,960
And don't go to the police.

790
00:52:49,933 --> 00:52:53,425
Since when do people
like us go to the police?

791
00:52:55,539 --> 00:52:56,631
Where should l bringthe money?

792
00:53:22,232 --> 00:53:23,460
lt's me.

793
00:53:23,767 --> 00:53:24,791
Who?

794
00:53:24,968 --> 00:53:28,062
We spoke about meetingat 8:00am.

795
00:53:31,241 --> 00:53:32,538
Have you got the money?

796
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:34,734
Yes, l have.

797
00:53:49,593 --> 00:53:51,083
What's wrong with you?

798
00:53:57,934 --> 00:53:58,958
My son!

799
00:53:59,669 --> 00:54:00,693
Sir, please..

800
00:54:00,804 --> 00:54:02,032
l've kept my end of the bargain.

801
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:05,971
Sir.. Sir, please!

802
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:21,580
So those six hours you
were missingthat day..

803
00:54:21,958 --> 00:54:23,585
What else could l do?

804
00:54:26,029 --> 00:54:27,587
My child's life wasat stake.

805
00:54:29,899 --> 00:54:31,730
And l had no other option.

806
00:54:32,702 --> 00:54:34,533
Plus if the other person..

807
00:54:34,638 --> 00:54:35,662
..begs you, saying..

808
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:37,205
..take this money, take it..

809
00:54:37,307 --> 00:54:38,604
..what crime did l commit?

810
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:40,198
l needed it.

811
00:54:40,844 --> 00:54:41,936
My child was dying!

812
00:54:43,313 --> 00:54:48,148
So l took a few thousand rupees.
What's the big deal?

813
00:54:48,251 --> 00:54:49,548
Will you shut up?

814
00:54:50,186 --> 00:54:52,814
You'll sacrifice us
for your son's sake?

815
00:54:57,661 --> 00:55:00,562
Meaning? Have you been caught?

816
00:55:02,666 --> 00:55:04,634
lt's been 10 daysand
nobody knowsa thing.

817
00:55:06,002 --> 00:55:08,232
The only reason you know
is that l'm telling you.

818
00:55:08,872 --> 00:55:09,896
This guy thinks he's been caught.

819
00:55:15,612 --> 00:55:16,704
Does Mr. Shukla know?

820
00:55:27,624 --> 00:55:29,990
lt's Rs.10000 for each of us.

821
00:55:39,302 --> 00:55:40,735
Even he..

822
00:55:59,389 --> 00:56:02,756
Brother, l've understood one thing.

823
00:56:06,329 --> 00:56:09,628
ln this world, if you just ask..

824
00:56:09,733 --> 00:56:12,634
..you'll keep standing in line..

825
00:56:12,736 --> 00:56:16,103
..and get nothing.

826
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:19,706
But grab it! Andthe world is yours.

827
00:56:26,149 --> 00:56:27,173
By the way..

828
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:31,786
This isn't a bad business.

829
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:38,126
What you couldn't make
workingfor three years..

830
00:56:38,428 --> 00:56:41,056
..we got from one smalljob!
- Stop this nonsense!

831
00:56:45,368 --> 00:56:47,199
Nonsense? That's what
you think it is.

832
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:50,065
l'm telling the truth!

833
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:57,011
l've been enlightened.
Don't you understand?

834
00:56:57,113 --> 00:56:58,205
l don't want to understand.

835
00:57:05,388 --> 00:57:09,757
So l guess you plan to
be a waiter all your life?

836
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:12,819
Plan to keep washing dishes?

837
00:57:15,865 --> 00:57:19,699
And what about you big
dreams of marrying a foreigner?

838
00:57:21,471 --> 00:57:23,701
Why don't you bundle up
your dreams..

839
00:57:23,807 --> 00:57:26,105
..andthrow them in the sea?

840
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:28,301

841
00:57:33,983 --> 00:57:37,009
Hey.. You read?

842
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:38,444
Yeah..

843
00:57:40,757 --> 00:57:42,190
You should see the movie.
lt's really good.

844
00:57:42,992 --> 00:57:44,016
Do you want a cup of tea?

845
00:57:44,761 --> 00:57:45,785
Yes, thank you?

846
00:57:52,836 --> 00:57:53,894
Kate..

847
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:56,863
Yeah?

848
00:58:00,109 --> 00:58:01,133

Oh, no.

No, means.

855
00:58:17,794 --> 00:58:19,455
Means..

856
00:58:20,129 --> 00:58:21,756
Wait, just hang on a minute.

857
00:58:21,865 --> 00:58:22,889
Kate, l love you.

858
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:25,124

00:58:32,809 --> 00:58:33,867
l love you.

860
00:58:36,279 --> 00:58:37,337
You said you liked me.

861
00:58:38,548 --> 00:58:41,949
Yes, l like you, Aman.
l like a lot of people.

862
00:58:42,819 --> 00:58:44,116
lt doesn't mean that
l love them all.

863
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:45,278
You have any boyfriend?

864
00:58:45,889 --> 00:58:48,858
No l don't have a boyfriend.
And l don't want one.

865
00:58:49,158 --> 00:58:50,352
Don't you understand?

866
00:58:52,462 --> 00:58:53,520
Look, it's not you.

867
00:58:54,831 --> 00:58:55,923
My life is messed up.

868
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,024
lt's crazy. l..

869
00:58:58,835 --> 00:59:01,360
l can't stay and l can't go,
and l have no money left.

870
00:59:01,471 --> 00:59:03,166
Kate, you want money?
l give you money.

871
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:06,101
l don't want your money, Aman.
- Why? l..

872
00:59:07,577 --> 00:59:09,204
Kate.. l help you.

873
00:59:13,516 --> 00:59:15,882
You have no idea..

874
00:59:15,985 --> 00:59:18,453
l needat least Rs.20000. Ok.

875
00:59:19,856 --> 00:59:24,384
Now why don't you just
leave me alone, please..

876
00:59:26,029 --> 00:59:27,496
Hey hero. Give me a look sometimes.

877
00:59:27,597 --> 00:59:29,895
l don't have the time.
- Never asked you the time.

878
00:59:30,533 --> 00:59:35,300
While you've been avoiding me,
l bought tickets to the multiplex.

879
00:59:36,005 --> 00:59:39,133
Tonight's show! - Stop
crossing my path like a black cat!

880
00:59:44,948 --> 00:59:45,972
Watchman!

881
00:59:46,382 --> 00:59:48,907
Go bring me a Femina
magazine from the news stand.

882
00:59:50,153 --> 00:59:53,247
Watchman! Can't you hear me?

883
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:59,861
Of course l can. But l don't want to.

884
00:59:59,963 --> 01:00:00,987
What?!
- Yeah.

885
01:00:01,197 --> 01:00:03,358
Just like how you have legs
but don't want to use them.

886
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:06,130
Go get it yourself.
- What?

887
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:08,370
l'm the watchman, not your slave.

888
01:00:12,642 --> 01:00:15,042
Mr. Aman! You? Here?

889
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:18,604
What's wrong?

890
01:00:19,983 --> 01:00:21,109
Come with me.

891
01:00:23,419 --> 01:00:25,046
You tell me, what you lack.

892
01:00:27,190 --> 01:00:30,091
You're young, strong, smart.

893
01:00:31,227 --> 01:00:33,354
Still that foreigner turned you down.

894
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:35,154
Why?

895
01:00:37,934 --> 01:00:39,959
You don't have money!

896
01:00:48,611 --> 01:00:50,169
Some salt please.

897
01:01:01,958 --> 01:01:06,554
But l don't think she's wrong.

898
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:14,198
Every woman dreams of
a man who earns well.

899
01:01:15,071 --> 01:01:20,668
With a house, car.. Who can take
her to movies, buy her clothes..

900
01:01:21,711 --> 01:01:24,009
You expect a woman to
tell you this herself?

901
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:26,047
You should know this.

902
01:01:27,383 --> 01:01:30,477
When you can't take care of yourself,
how will you take care of her?

903
01:01:41,664 --> 01:01:43,427
Sounds bitter, doesn't it?

904
01:01:45,268 --> 01:01:47,065
But this is the truth.

905
01:01:48,738 --> 01:01:54,040
ln today's world, the only
difference between yes and no..

906
01:01:56,112 --> 01:01:57,443
..is money.. Period.

907
01:02:05,088 --> 01:02:06,282
You're not eatinganything?

908
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:08,114
You want something else?

909
01:02:13,429 --> 01:02:14,623
You were saying
something this morning.

910
01:02:25,641 --> 01:02:28,508
Each month, we'll do one or two..

911
01:02:28,611 --> 01:02:29,635
..that'sall.

912
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:33,080
We'll ask for very little money.

913
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:36,211
That way, it's not hard
for the person to pay..

914
01:02:37,186 --> 01:02:39,120
..but we still make a living.

915
01:02:43,659 --> 01:02:44,683
And what if we're caught.

916
01:02:46,562 --> 01:02:49,497
What if someone goes to the cops?

917
01:02:50,399 --> 01:02:53,163
Why do you repeat
yourself like a parrot?

918
01:02:53,469 --> 01:02:54,493
Have we got caught yet?

919
01:02:56,539 --> 01:02:59,337
We'll kidnap the common man.

920
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:03,272
He fears the cops more than us.

921
01:03:07,583 --> 01:03:11,314
Even if we do this for six months,
life will be good.

922
01:03:14,490 --> 01:03:17,721
And if there's any danger or we
don't feel like it, we'll quit.

923
01:03:18,261 --> 01:03:21,253
lt's in our hands,
isn't it? What do you say?

924
01:03:34,610 --> 01:03:38,137
Well done! Now
you're talking like a man!

925
01:03:38,247 --> 01:03:40,477
Hey, bring one more.

926
01:03:41,617 --> 01:03:42,641
Very good!

927
01:03:42,752 --> 01:03:47,155
l always knew you're a good man!

928
01:03:52,428 --> 01:03:56,421
The only thing is we
can't do this by ourselves.

929
01:04:00,736 --> 01:04:01,760
Understand?

930
01:04:07,810 --> 01:04:08,834
Good evening.

931
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:37,730
What have you achieved?

932
01:04:40,176 --> 01:04:41,200
What have you achieved?

933
01:04:45,648 --> 01:04:49,140
Your entire life has passed you by..

934
01:04:49,252 --> 01:04:56,215
..sitting on this pedestal
of honesty and integrity.

935
01:04:56,726 --> 01:04:57,750
What did you gain?

936
01:05:00,196 --> 01:05:01,891
Even at thisage
you're driving a car.

937
01:05:02,365 --> 01:05:04,629
Listening to your boss'sabuses.

938
01:05:14,277 --> 01:05:18,611
l know exactly what happened to you.

939
01:05:26,555 --> 01:05:27,681
You've become old..

940
01:05:28,691 --> 01:05:32,183
..and given up your dreams,
but we haven't.

941
01:05:32,295 --> 01:05:33,523
Our whole life isahead of us.

942
01:05:33,629 --> 01:05:35,324
We have family and
children to think of.

943
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:38,457
We don't want to live
like you, without respect.

944
01:05:40,636 --> 01:05:42,263
lf they won't give it to us,
we'll take it by force.

945
01:05:50,246 --> 01:05:54,945
We've decided,
whatever the fallout..

946
01:05:55,351 --> 01:05:59,344
..we're goingahead,
whether you join us or not

947
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:07,295
lf you help us, there's no
chance of us getting caught.

948
01:06:08,364 --> 01:06:10,355
lf you don't, and we're caught..

949
01:06:10,733 --> 01:06:13,964
..you'll follow us into the prison,
this much is certain.

950
01:06:15,271 --> 01:06:18,399
Don't think we're threatening you.

951
01:06:19,275 --> 01:06:22,711
We're just explaining.
Showing you a mirror.

952
01:06:24,947 --> 01:06:30,749
Our mindsare made up,
we have decided.

953
01:06:35,458 --> 01:06:40,452
We've already worked
out how and what..

954
01:06:41,297 --> 01:06:46,633
You decide when and let us know.

955
01:06:48,971 --> 01:06:49,995
Good night.

956
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:30,039
Excuse me, do you have a match.

957
01:07:31,947 --> 01:07:32,971
Please.

958
01:07:34,350 --> 01:07:35,374
Here.

959
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:41,823
By the way, can you tell
us how to go to Malad?

960
01:07:42,091 --> 01:07:43,524
You're headed to Malad?

961
01:07:43,659 --> 01:07:45,718
Yes..
- lt's quite far.

962
01:07:46,495 --> 01:07:49,862
He says it's quite far.
-Actually, l was headed there.

963
01:07:49,965 --> 01:07:50,989
Really?

964
01:07:51,367 --> 01:07:54,336
Mr. Pandey. He's headedto Malad.
Should we ask him to come?

965
01:07:54,437 --> 01:07:55,665
He'll show us the way,
and we'll drop him off.

966
01:07:57,473 --> 01:08:00,499
Why don't you come along..

967
01:08:01,377 --> 01:08:03,675
No, no..
- Come on. Please come.

968
01:08:04,113 --> 01:08:06,513
This will be easy.
You'll show us the way and..

969
01:08:12,455 --> 01:08:14,423
Your name?
- Abhay. - Abhay.

From?
-Jharkhand.

971
01:08:15,991 --> 01:08:18,983
Jharkhand. Mr. Pandey,
pull over for a second.

972
01:08:20,396 --> 01:08:22,523
So you're from Jharkhand.
Very good.

973
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:25,492
Right here.

974
01:08:32,508 --> 01:08:33,873
Who's this?

975
01:08:35,010 --> 01:08:36,534
He too is goingto Malad.

976
01:09:21,724 --> 01:09:23,885
Wonderful news!

977
01:09:24,126 --> 01:09:25,150

01:09:25,528 --> 01:09:28,156
Listen.. l'm sending you the money.

979
01:09:28,864 --> 01:09:31,492
Why? You have a problem with that?

980
01:09:31,634 --> 01:09:34,535
When l couldn't send it,
you usedto ask why not.

981
01:09:34,737 --> 01:09:36,637
Now that l can you ask why.

982
01:09:37,139 --> 01:09:39,505
What's your story? Okay. Yeah.

983
01:09:43,879 --> 01:09:46,006
Relax. l'm not running off.

Write it down.
We'll settle it later.

986
01:09:54,490 --> 01:09:57,618
And oh yeah.. Control you hero.

987
01:09:58,928 --> 01:10:00,520

Hey you.. Hey!

Why didn't you come to work?
We're getting complaints..

And l won't be comingany more.
This is what l came to say.

995
01:10:25,688 --> 01:10:26,712
But you didn't let me talk.

996
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:32,655
Nowthis guy hasa call.

997
01:10:39,134 --> 01:10:40,158

Fifty thousand rupees.

999
01:11:36,925 --> 01:11:38,722
Did he look like he's
from Jharkhand?

1000
01:11:38,994 --> 01:11:40,052
Nonsense he's from Jharkhand!

1001

On Saturday..
- Okay, bye.

You scoundrel! You dare touch me?

1015
01:12:54,269 --> 01:12:56,294
How dare you touch me?

1016
01:12:56,739 --> 01:12:58,900
Can you believe it? He touched me!

1017
01:12:59,274 --> 01:13:01,765
Don't forget who you are!
Go sit in your place.

1018
01:13:02,378 --> 01:13:04,642
Did you see that?
What's your problem?

1019
01:13:04,747 --> 01:13:06,180
Go do your work, watchman!

1020
01:13:06,382 --> 01:13:08,213
Did you see him?
He tried to touch me!

1021
01:13:08,417 --> 01:13:09,782
l can't believe this!
- Everybody's looking..

1022
01:13:09,885 --> 01:13:13,048
Let them look, they should know
this man's place!

1023
01:13:13,155 --> 01:13:15,282
What are you doing? l'm fine.

01:13:16,191 --> 01:13:18,716
Yes, l'm fine.

1025
01:13:19,762 --> 01:13:25,792
This man stinks! He's filthy!

1026
01:13:26,702 --> 01:13:28,761
l'll get him fired.

1027
01:13:28,871 --> 01:13:31,396
Move it.

1028
01:13:31,907 --> 01:13:32,931
Hey driver!

1029
01:13:35,711 --> 01:13:36,735
l'lljust see you then.

1030
01:13:36,845 --> 01:13:37,869
Come on!

1031
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:46,017
Everything okay?

1032
01:13:53,228 --> 01:13:54,286
You need something?

1033
01:14:05,307 --> 01:14:07,832
l've decided who
should be kidnapped next.

1034
01:14:08,744 --> 01:14:09,768
What?

1035
01:14:11,814 --> 01:14:15,443
l've decided who we
should kidnap next.

1036
01:14:17,486 --> 01:14:20,353
What are you saying!
Mr. Shukla, this is fantastic!

1037
01:14:20,756 --> 01:14:23,020
Didn't l tell you, Aman?
One day Mr. Shukla will..

1038
01:14:23,125 --> 01:14:24,149
Who is he?

1039
01:14:30,999 --> 01:14:32,330
Have you gone crazy?

1040
01:14:33,502 --> 01:14:34,799
Do you know what that means?

1041
01:14:35,437 --> 01:14:37,803
lt means every
chance of getting caught.

1042
01:14:40,442 --> 01:14:41,466
Have you gone mad?

1043
01:14:41,777 --> 01:14:43,210
Yes, l've gone mad.

1044
01:14:43,846 --> 01:14:45,143
Mr. Shukla. What are you saying?

1045
01:14:45,881 --> 01:14:47,371
We'll all get caught.

1046
01:14:48,383 --> 01:14:49,816
This old man has gone senile.

1047
01:14:49,918 --> 01:14:51,909
He's digginga grave and
wants us to lie in it with him.

1048
01:14:54,056 --> 01:14:57,150
Mr. Shukla Yadav is right.

1049
01:14:58,327 --> 01:14:59,919
You think this man understands?

1050
01:15:02,531 --> 01:15:04,829
We won't do it, that's it!
- You'll have to do it.

1051
01:15:05,133 --> 01:15:06,964
What?
- You'll have to do it!

1052
01:15:07,069 --> 01:15:08,900
Why? You think
we don't have a choice?

1053
01:15:09,004 --> 01:15:13,498
Listen. l'm doing this
whether you come along or not.

1054
01:15:14,476 --> 01:15:16,842
lf you join me, there's no
chance of getting caught.

1055
01:15:17,145 --> 01:15:20,945
lf you don't and l get caught,
l'll take you both with me.

1056
01:15:21,416 --> 01:15:22,440
Think about it.

1057
01:15:23,819 --> 01:15:24,911
Either way, we're already in a mess.

1058
01:15:27,422 --> 01:15:28,889
l've already planned it.

1059
01:15:30,826 --> 01:15:32,953
When and how it's to be done.

1060
01:15:33,061 --> 01:15:34,187
You just be ready.

1061
01:15:50,345 --> 01:15:51,369
Kate!

1062
01:15:57,085 --> 01:15:58,109
Kate!

1063
01:16:01,290 --> 01:16:02,314
Kate!

1064
01:16:02,424 --> 01:16:05,450
Your white girl has
taken her thingsand gone.

1065
01:16:18,273 --> 01:16:19,968
You can't trust these folks.

1066
01:16:20,075 --> 01:16:22,566
When they come or leave,
what they do..

1067
01:17:14,262 --> 01:17:15,354
Fool! You stupid guy!

1068
01:17:15,464 --> 01:17:17,364
How many times have l told
you don't brake like this!

1069
01:17:17,933 --> 01:17:20,925
Who are you? - Shut up.
- What insolence is this! Leave me!

1070
01:17:41,156 --> 01:17:42,248
We're goingto jail.

1071
01:17:42,491 --> 01:17:46,359
Nobody is going nowhere.
This is our last time. That's it.

1072
01:17:48,296 --> 01:17:50,457
Listen, this time we'll
ask for such a big ransom.

1073
01:17:50,632 --> 01:17:53,430
For two years we'll live in luxury.
We won't have to do anything.

1074
01:17:53,702 --> 01:17:55,670
You think the cops are
sitting with their hands tied?

1075
01:17:56,238 --> 01:17:57,262
They won't hunt us down?

1076
01:17:57,372 --> 01:17:59,533
They can only find us
if we're in this city.

1077
01:18:00,542 --> 01:18:02,203
As soon as this is done, we'll split
the money and go to our villages.

1078
01:18:02,310 --> 01:18:04,676
We'll come back in six months,
when things have cooled down.

1079
01:18:05,147 --> 01:18:07,945
Mr. Shukla, what nonsense
are you talking? - l'm right.

1080
01:18:08,050 --> 01:18:09,608
Nothing will happen. l'm telling you.

1081
01:18:14,723 --> 01:18:17,954
Hello Simone. What's up?
- We have your wife and driver.

1082
01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:19,284

1083
01:18:19,394 --> 01:18:22,295
We have your wife and driver.

1084
01:18:22,597 --> 01:18:23,621
Who is this?

1085
01:18:23,732 --> 01:18:25,461
Rs.20 million to let them go.

1086
01:18:25,734 --> 01:18:26,962
What nonsense?

1087
01:18:28,070 --> 01:18:29,469
You have till tomorrow morning.

1088
01:18:31,073 --> 01:18:33,701
Listen.. Let me speak to my wife.

1089
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:45,077
Okay. Hold on a minute.

Ma'am!

1091
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:53,987
Wake her up! Phone call.

1092
01:18:55,363 --> 01:18:58,457
Hey wake up! Get up!

1093
01:19:01,069 --> 01:19:03,299
Listen.. it's your husband.

1094
01:19:03,772 --> 01:19:05,535
Anoop?
- Yes, yes!

1095
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:06,664
Here. Speak to him.

1096
01:19:08,110 --> 01:19:11,568
Anoop.. Anoop..

1097
01:19:12,380 --> 01:19:17,044
Listen, don't try
goingto the cops.

1098
01:19:17,686 --> 01:19:19,551
l'll call you tomorrow
morning, okay?

1099
01:19:21,089 --> 01:19:22,113
Where's my driver?

1100
01:19:24,793 --> 01:19:26,021
Where's my driver?

1101
01:19:28,130 --> 01:19:32,328
Why are you doingthis to me?
Why are you doingthis to me?

1102
01:19:32,534 --> 01:19:33,762
Because this is what you deserve.

1103
01:19:35,270 --> 01:19:37,033
Mr. Shukla, what are you doing?

1104
01:19:37,172 --> 01:19:38,764
Driver? You?

1105
01:19:41,076 --> 01:19:42,441
Driver, driver, driver.

1106
01:19:42,544 --> 01:19:44,512
My earsare fried
hearing you call me that.

1107
01:19:47,649 --> 01:19:49,378
How long have l worked with you?

1108
01:19:49,484 --> 01:19:51,748
Have you ever called me by my name?

1109
01:19:52,554 --> 01:19:54,613
No! Because if you do..

1110
01:19:54,723 --> 01:19:56,418
..you'll lose respect, right?

1111
01:19:57,125 --> 01:19:59,389
Driver, driver, driver!

1112
01:20:00,162 --> 01:20:02,062
You want to keep reminding me
of my place by calling me that?

1113
01:20:03,165 --> 01:20:05,133
l'm dirt from the gutter?
My body stinks?

1114
01:20:05,233 --> 01:20:08,464
Come on, smell this!
l stink, isn't it?

1115
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:11,803
Won't you abuse me now? Won't you?

1116
01:20:13,508 --> 01:20:17,604
But we gave you everything..
Clothes, money, everything.

1117
01:20:18,513 --> 01:20:20,140
Mr. Shukla, what are you doing?

1118
01:20:20,248 --> 01:20:23,411
Have you gone mad? Calm down.

1119
01:20:33,862 --> 01:20:36,626
Your wife will reach home an
hour after we get the money.

1120
01:20:37,299 --> 01:20:38,391
How should l believe you?

1121
01:20:38,633 --> 01:20:39,657
What?

1122
01:20:41,603 --> 01:20:43,571
Do you have another option?

1123
01:20:46,541 --> 01:20:47,565
Where do l bring the money?

1124
01:20:48,476 --> 01:20:49,704

As soon as this is over,
pack your bags.

We'll leave by the 5:00am train.

1130
01:21:49,604 --> 01:21:51,162
Put the suitcase down.

1131

She'll be home in 30 minutes.

01:22:38,653 --> 01:22:41,213
Run, Yadav, run!

Have you gone crazy?
- No, you were crazy! - Run.

Hey hero..

After all, life is never complete.

1176

You are alive.

The other day, the judge saidthat..

1179

..the government doesn't
consider you to be alive.

1180
01:26:56,578 --> 01:26:57,738
That's the reason you were let off.

1181
01:27:11,192 --> 01:27:17,097
This death certificate has
provedto be very beneficial to you.
