1
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,960
Hey! Noodle-Head!

2
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,000
Why are you so dull?

3
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,760
Nothing, Arjun!

4
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,560
What?

5
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,000
Mani has come.
- Hi Noodle-head!

6
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,920
Dude!
- Dude!

7
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,800
You hardly come to meet us
after you got married

8
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,000
and you still come late!

9
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,640
I am late because I got married.

10
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,560
Only married men will
understand how tough

11
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,000
it is to meet friends
after marriage.

12
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,080
You will never understand.

13
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,880
You should be happy I am here.

14
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,880
Get lost!

15
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,440
You need to take so much pain
to meet us, leave now.

16
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,120
Are you insulting me, Arjun?

17
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,720
You call me to drink and abuse me?

18
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,320
I am leaving!

19
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,400
What was that?

20
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,440
Liquor is more important.

21
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,720
But dude...

22
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,720
How did you ever clear
Thermodynamics paper?

23
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,440
I thought you will clear it
in the next century.

24
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,840
And she taught you!

25
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,200
That's an achievement dude!

26
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,160
We need to celebrate this.

27
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,200
Yes!

28
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,440
Feels like a 'Nannari Sarbat'
(Native colored Soda)

29
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,680
Hey Anu!
- Make it fast no!

30
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,800
Cheers!

31
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,200
Oh that's the witch!

32
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,680
Baby!

33
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,120
You've gone to drink
with your friends right?

34
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,600
I swear I am not drinking baby.

35
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,840
Hey! Don't lie.

36
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,240
Come here,
I will blow and prove you wrong.

37
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,880
'Okay, send me the location
and I'll be there.'

38
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,040
'Send no?'

39
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,440
Okay leave it.
I'll come there and blow! Right!

40
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,960
Baby...!
- 'Oye oye oye!'

41
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,680
Bye Bye baby!
- 'Come home, I will kill you.'

42
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,760
Bye baby! Oh lord!

43
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,480
Dude! Don't you think baby-ing her
is getting a bit too much?

44
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,520
She's my wife and I call her that!
What's your problem?

45
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,480
Why do you have to be so cheesy
for this arranged marriage affair?

46
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,360
So arranged marriage is
so easy for you guys?

47
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,120
Being in a relationship
for 4-5 years

48
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,440
getting married and then
having fun in bed

49
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,440
is nothing in front of getting
married to a stranger and expecting

50
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,600
and accepting to do
the same on the very first day.

51
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,800
Not even closer dude!

52
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,640
Arranged marriage is more fun dude!

53
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,400
You will come into
my category one day.

54
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,070
No way!

55
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,520
There's no chance
I will marry a stranger.

56
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,400
Get lost!
- Hey, let's see dude!

57
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,400
You will be trapped buddy!

58
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,760
You will be trapped
and I will see it. - Arjun?

59
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,040
Shall we get married?

60
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,689
Arjun?

61
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,000
Aren't you Arjun?

62
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,240
Yes! You?

63
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,880
Meera, your school senior!
Have you forgotten me?

64
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,320
Meera Akka (Elder Sister)!

65
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,800
Akka?
I am just 2 years elder than you.

66
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,400
It's been so long!

67
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,800
The last time we met was
in our school annual day function.

68
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,560
After that you changed
schools in 7th grade no?

69
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,640
Yes! Father got transferred
to Kerala, so we had to move.

70
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,440
Meera!
- Just a minute.

71
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,720
Okay, I have to leave.
We'll catch up later.

72
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,791
Bye!
- Okay!

73
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,480
Hey, don't forget
to add me on facebook.

74
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,040
Okay?
- Meera Akka?

75
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,280
Hug for me?

76
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,480
Missed Akka's hug!

77
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,200
Thanks Bro!
- It's okay.

78
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,520
Do you have anyone else left to hug?

79
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,560
I asked you "Shall we get married?"

80
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,440
You're doing something else
comfortably ignoring it.

81
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,395
Hey!

82
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,760
We're friends dude!
Don't be kidding.

83
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,120
He's also my friend, I don't feel
that way towards him.

84
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,320
Hey!
I am married dude!

85
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,040
Does that make a difference?

86
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,120
Get lost!
- You get lost!

87
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,680
His name is Matthew.

88
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,960
Age: 28, Doctor.

89
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,080
That's all I know about him.

90
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,240
For the past 10 days dad has
been asking me to marry this fellow.

91
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,720
I was a bit confused.

92
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,800
You just said right?

93
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,200
That you can't marry a stranger.

94
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,240
That's when I suddenly felt.

95
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,640
So asked it off.

96
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,960
Give it to me.

97
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,360
Let's see that face.

98
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,920
I thought he'll look like a duffer.
Much better.

99
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,920
He looks much better than I thought.

100
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,076
Give it back.

101
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,280
Think for a while
and let me know if you're okay!

102
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,040
Okay?

103
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,320
Hey! Anu!

104
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,920
Hey! Anu!

105
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,560
Dude, pay the bill and go home.

106
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,880
Why should I pay for your treat?

107
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,840
Anu!

108
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,040
Anna (Big brother),
please wait a minute.

109
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,520
Let's go bro!

110
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,320
I just beat you!
- Why are you screaming?

111
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,960
Noodle-Head!

112
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,680
Hey Noodle-Head!
Who's she dude?

113
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,800
Meera Akka!
Sixth standard!

114
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,680
Though she's an Akka...
She looks beautiful no?

115
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,040
Yes dude!

116
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,400
Happy B'day!
- Thank you

117
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,000
Anu, where's your mother?

118
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,000
Arjun, you acted well.

119
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,560
Akka, you were a
good storyteller too.

120
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,720
Okay, bye

121
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,186
Arjun, after the semester gets over,

122
00:08:08,266 --> 00:08:09,720
can we go on a road trip?
- In the bike!

123
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,200
How will Mani come if we
go on a Bike? Crack!

124
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,360
Let's go in a car.

125
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,760
Cheers!
- Cheers!

126
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,520
What the hell is this?

127
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,960
We shouldn't be coming here dude!

128
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,160
Oh, Love pops out
in the last minute and

129
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,920
she will throw off
everything and run off.

130
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,720
What kind of logic is this?

131
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,520
Love has no logic you Noodle-Head.

132
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,960
It's all Magic.

133
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,680
Victory! Victory!

134
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:20,880
There is no space for any
other motto in this Ashokan's life.

135
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,240
Oh these heels!

136
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,800
Hey! What are you doing here?

137
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,440
You seemed lonely standing here.
That's why I came.

138
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,360
Nothing like that.

139
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,320
You think I can't figure out
looking at your face?

140
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,120
Dude! How's it?

141
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,960
Is it looking good?

142
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,520
You want to wear it?
I'll give you tomorrow?

143
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,000
Why do you keep making
dosas everyday mom?

144
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,080
You'll crave for this dosa
after you get married.

145
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,400
I'll remind you then.

146
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,880
First clear off your arrears
and get a life.

147
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,280
Stop whining about your dosas.

148
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,920
Aunt, can I get an egg-dosa?

149
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,920
Shall we get married?

150
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,800
Arjun!

151
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,000
Arjun!

152
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,440
Why are you smiling?

153
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,480
I had a good dream.

154
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,600
Anu!

155
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,880
I gave it a thought.

156
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,040
I don't have a reason
to say "No" to you.

157
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,240
What do you mean? I don't get it.

158
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,520
I mean, I want to marry you.

159
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,853
Hey!

160
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,720
You're not blabbering
because you're high right?

161
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,760
I make more sense
when I'm high dude.

162
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,960
'We all believe that Marriages
are made in heaven.'

163
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,200
'Thunder and lightning
are also like that.'

164
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,200
Sir! Please move aside and talk no?

165
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,960
Welcome dude!

166
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,840
Hasn't Anu come yet?

167
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,080
How's Swathi?

168
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,262
Good!

169
00:12:28,574 --> 00:12:29,536
Your son?

170
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,360
Good!

171
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,400
What name have you
thought of for him?

172
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,382
Hey...

173
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,920
Sorry sir!

174
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,600
Is that of so much concern now?

175
00:12:41,174 --> 00:12:42,080
Hey dude!

176
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,120
I feel you both are very impulsive
with this decision of divorce.

177
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,320
Decision to marry her was impulsive,
and that's why I'm here.

178
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,400
Crack pot!

179
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,080
Please dude!

180
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,760
If you guys open up to each other...

181
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,720
Dude!

182
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,480
This won't work out dude.

183
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,480
That's it.

184
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,520
Just leave it there.

185
00:13:05,921 --> 00:13:06,880
Hey!

186
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,720
Come in madam.

187
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,520
Please give some space no?

188
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,280
Move move!

189
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,680
You have a seat madam.

190
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,520
Dude!

191
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,520
Why are you going there?

192
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,440
She's also my friend dude.

193
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,560
Greetings!
Please sit down.

194
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,440
What's the first case?

195
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,200
Hey Thambi (baby brother)!

196
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,440
I'm talking to you Mr Blue shirt.

197
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,440
What?

198
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:59,320
Your friend is trying so hard
to make you get back to your wife?

199
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,680
Who're you?
What do you want?

200
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,680
Arjun Marimuthu!

201
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,920
Let's discuss what I want later.

202
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,320
First of all you think you will get
a divorce in this court today?

203
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,800
She's here right?

204
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,560
Hey!

205
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,720
How do you know my name?

206
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,840
Not just your name

207
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,080
I know everything
that's going to happen

208
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,840
in this court for
the next 15 minutes.

209
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,120
Shall I tell you?

210
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,440
You want to listen?

211
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,040
In 2 minutes a guy will
read out "Case no 23314

212
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,360
Arjun Marimuthu-Anu Paulraj"

213
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,240
you both will stand
in front of the judge.

214
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,440
The judge will ask
your concern in this divorce

215
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,520
and you will give your concern.

216
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,240
She will ask the same question
to your wife and

217
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,840
when she is about to answer,
she will faint.

218
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,240
Your friend will
run in out of panic

219
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,360
and a constable will call
108 for ambulance.

220
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,760
A lawyer will splash water
on your wife's face

221
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,800
and in the next 2 minutes
the ambulance arrives.

222
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,240
In spite of she being hesitant

223
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,280
your friend takes her
in the ambulance and

224
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,280
looking at all this the judge
postpones your case to evening 4 PM.

225
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,320
When you come back at 4 PM...

226
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,120
You won't get the divorce.

227
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,800
Get lost you crack.

228
00:15:13,432 --> 00:15:14,360
How can an ambulance
come in 2 minutes

229
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,735
for the intensity of
the traffic in our city?

230
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,120
Whatever this crack tells
will happen for sure Thambi.

231
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,800
You will have this fear,
if you will get a divorce or not.

232
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,360
I won't fear.

233
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,200
What if you get the fear?

234
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,320
Come to the address.

235
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,880
My boss will get you divorce.

236
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,440
Case no. 23314 Arjun
Marimuthu-Anu Paulraj.

237
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,320
Do we have your concern
in this divorce?

238
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,880
I approve madam.

239
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,800
Do we have your consent too?

240
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,760
Oh lord!

241
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,640
Check what happened!

242
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,040
Anu!

243
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,680
Anu!

244
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,840
Hello 108?

245
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,640
Madam!

246
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,760
Wake up madam!

247
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,040
What will I answer to your dad?

248
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,480
Someone check if the
ambulance has arrived.

249
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,960
Move aside!
- Give me some way!

250
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,480
Move aside no?

251
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,960
This case is postponed to 4:00 pm.

252
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,960
You're all right, no?

253
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,680
So...

254
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,560
You will come back at 4 PM
to sign the divorce right?

255
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,240
Hey!
Senseless...

256
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,760
These are the kind we land up on!

257
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,080
'You will fear if you will get
your divorce or not.'

258
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,320
'If you get that fear...'

259
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,040
This is the place.

260
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,200
This abandoned place
is named Love court?

261
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,160
Abandoned?

262
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,680
Can't you see such a big building?

263
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,640
Building?

264
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,120
So high in the morning?

265
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,840
Heat is eating up
your senses or what?

266
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,840
I'm so high
and you're so sober and clear.

267
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,400
Give me the money.

268
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,760
Be careful dude.

269
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,960
Morons in the morning!

270
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,400
Love court and shuttle court!

271
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,040
Hey Arjun!

272
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,120
Welcome!

273
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,600
So do you feel the fear now?

274
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,040
I told you, you'd come.

275
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,800
Who're you?

276
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,080
How do you know everything
that was going to happen?

277
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,200
What is this Love Court?

278
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,680
Why did you plan and trap me?

279
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,360
How dare you laugh
when I'm talking to you.

280
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,498
Answer me.

281
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,240
Boss!

282
00:19:29,618 --> 00:19:30,600
Boss!

283
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,240
Coming!

284
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,480
Hey! Hi Arjun!

285
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,440
How're you?

286
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,640
How's the court going?

287
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,775
Sir!

288
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,560
Who are you sir?

289
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,960
You're creating a drama in my life.

290
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,080
Who are you sir?

291
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,760
Why are you playing
around in my life?

292
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,520
Wait a second!

293
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,000
Hey bring that phone no?

294
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,000
Phone is there,
you can go and take it, go!

295
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,040
Pull out that chair and sit down.

296
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,280
For what?
- You sit down, I will tell you.

297
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,600
Sit down baby!

298
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,360
Relax!

299
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,600
Relax?
- Yes.

300
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,280
I'm confused as to who you are
and what this place is.

301
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,480
How do you expect me to be relaxed?

302
00:20:38,423 --> 00:20:39,320
Okay!

303
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,040
I will answer all your questions.

304
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,480
But more important is

305
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,560
believe me, I will get you
the divorce you want.

306
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,200
Who? You?

307
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,600
Don't be kidding sir.

308
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,320
Customer is going,
won't you stop him?

309
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,640
What's this Arjun?

310
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,400
Don't be so impatient.

311
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,440
Your impatience has made you
come and stand here.

312
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,440
Be patient.

313
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,160
Anu!
Why do you want to divorce her?

314
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,400
Tell me the reason
I will get you the divorce.

315
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,600
Don't think about time boss.

316
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,880
There is nothing called time.

317
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,200
Even if it's there,
my boss will clear

318
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,720
this case before your time 03:00 PM.

319
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,120
Arjun Marimuthu...

320
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,080
Anu...

321
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,600
Paulraj!
- Paulraj!

322
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,880
Love marriage?

323
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,720
Love after marriage?

324
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,240
What?

325
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,840
Not a love marriage,
no love after marriage

326
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,560
then what the hell is this?

327
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,640
A love marriage without love sir.

328
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,440
What?
- He's trying to confuse us boss.

329
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,400
A best friend from my childhood
asked me out for marriage.

330
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,240
I said "Yes" because
I had no reason to say "No"

331
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,880
But there wasn't
any love in this sir.

332
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,720
Oh...so this is love
marriage without love.

333
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,920
Okay...!
- So you didn't have love right?

334
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,560
Isn't a good reason to say "No"?

335
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,080
You could've told
that and escaped no?

336
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,320
This is the problem with our guys.

337
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,680
They keep saying "Yes"
when they're not supposed to

338
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,480
then regret all through
the life for that "Yes"

339
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,080
Don't you have any sense?
- Sir.

340
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,800
Daily before we sleep, we use to
talk to each other on phone.

341
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,480
After marriage, it's going to be
the same friend on the same bed.

342
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,280
That's all right?
What's there in this?

343
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,720
That's why I said okay sir.

344
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,640
But after marriage only did I know
that it's a blunder.

345
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,760
Why?

346
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,880
People are craving to get
a wife who is a friend.

347
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,080
You've got a friend as a wife.

348
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,640
Shouldn't you be celebrating?
- Dog!

349
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,920
What Arjun?

350
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,040
Crackpot!

351
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,400
You can look at
your wife as a friend.

352
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,640
But a looking at
a friend as a wife...

353
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,000
You can never do that.

354
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,320
Ask me!

355
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,840
I will tell you a bunch of stories.

356
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,680
So, you both decided
to get married right?

357
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,320
How did you convince at your homes?

358
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,200
Since it's a inter-caste marriage,
they will oppose no?

359
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,000
The next day they came home sir.

360
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,080
Both dad and daughter.

361
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,800
Mom!

362
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,600
Arjun, come come come!

363
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,240
Did we spoil your sleep?

364
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,800
Go wash your face and come.

365
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,360
We will discuss your
wedding with Anu.

366
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,440
Did you say you will marry Anu?

367
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,440
What are you thinking?
Tell me!

368
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,360
Yes dad!

369
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,200
You said she's just friend?

370
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,120
Even now she's a friend dad!

371
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,640
Sir! How sir?

372
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,640
What how?
- How sir?

373
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,080
That's what I'm asking,
what are you talking about?

374
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,440
How did you accept to give away
your daughter to this fellow?

375
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,080
Sorry dude!

376
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,160
Sir!

377
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,200
I know Arjun since his childhood.

378
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,960
I'm sure he will take care of
my daughter really well.

379
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,520
What else do I need to think about?

380
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,360
Sir are you...

381
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,200
Are you worried that
we're Christians?

382
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,640
Oh no, I don't care about
those things sir.

383
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,640
Then what sir?

384
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,640
Sir, he's been a duffer
for the past two years.

385
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,080
He's not employed.

386
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,720
He just cleared his arrears.

387
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,960
Sir!
So it's that thing that bothers you?

388
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,960
Instead of Arjun working in
some random company, just

389
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,640
like my daughter he can
work in my company itself.

390
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,480
They're the ones who have to take
care of my company after me right?

391
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,280
What do you say Arjun?

392
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,480
That...
- Why do you even ask him sir?

393
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,600
You are offering your daughter
and a job for him.

394
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,280
You've a generous heart sir.

395
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,880
So when can we have the wedding sir?

396
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,520
We can have it immediately.

397
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,320
Your father-in-law is a gold man.

398
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,720
Who?

399
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,120
My father-in-law?
- Yes!

400
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,000
Listen to my full story first!

401
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,560
'To avoid confusion of,'

402
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,240
'if it's going to be a church
wedding or a temple wedding'

403
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,960
'we instead did it
in a registrar office.'

404
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,800
'But reception in a 5 star hotel'

405
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,440
'A beach facing apartment on
the 14th floor as a wedding gift.'

406
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,880
'Life...was pretty good sir.'

407
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,680
Okay, come to the matter.

408
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,400
Sir?

409
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,640
Come to the point dude!

410
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,480
Here I come sir.

411
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,720
What happened?

412
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,440
Nothing, nothing!

413
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,920
One minute!

414
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,920
Why are you giggling?

415
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,920
Well...

416
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,760
I have seen you
as a friend from my childhood!

417
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,960
All of a sudden, being asked to be
romantic with you in a closed room

418
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,120
I'm not able to get into that mood.

419
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,600
That's why I'm giggling.

420
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,680
What about you?

421
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,080
Let's not force it.

422
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,440
Let it happen organically.

423
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,520
Are you sure?

424
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,160
Sure.

425
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,400
We can actually postpone
our honeymoon as well.

426
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,760
Damn tragedy!

427
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,440
Brother!

428
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,320
Well...

429
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,160
We've been friends for so long no...

430
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,520
Suddenly looking at her
that way is kind of

431
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,120
I felt it was very cheap.

432
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,200
Do you get what I'm saying?
- Yes I do I do!

433
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,080
So...

434
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,880
The girl being his friend
is the primary issue.

435
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:34,960
Okay, go ahead!

436
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,200
Even without romance,
the first 3 weeks were very good.

437
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,840
Hey! Where's my space?

438
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,240
Here, in this corner.

439
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,720
Who are you?

440
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,520
Oh, Hey Arjun...Oh My God!

441
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,320
Now I understand
the value of my Mother's dosa.

442
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,240
Is this even a Dosa?

443
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,440
Arjun!

444
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,080
Hey!

445
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,400
Noodle-Head!

446
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,520
Prank in the morning!

447
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,800
Grandpa, this is not our house.

448
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,480
Sorry Anna (Elder Brother)!
My grandpa has dementia.

449
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,320
Arjun please Arjun!
- Go to hell!

450
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,880
Oh my hair!

451
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,480
No!

452
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,187
'That's why I am in abscond
- Abscond?'

453
00:28:12,267 --> 00:28:14,760
Just a minute dad!
Arjun!

454
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,720
Dad is asking you to come
to office from Monday!

455
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,720
You're okay with it right?

456
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,840
Wait and watch the game of Kaali!

457
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,280
Hey! Answer me.

458
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,600
Okay
- He says okay dad.

459
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,160
Don't disturb me Anu,
I want to win Mani.

460
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,880
It's okay!

461
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,320
Hi!
- Who's she?

462
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,920
She's Noodles-Head, my friend!

463
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,200
Hey!

464
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,000
Wife!

465
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,480
Yes!

466
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,520
You did it with Mani?

467
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,320
Do you also have dementia
just like my grandpa?

468
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,160
Take that on your face!

469
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,600
Go to hell!

470
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,920
Take the coffee!

471
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,480
I'll kill you!

472
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,640
What the hell is happening here?

473
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,280
When are you going to
behave like Husband-Wife?

474
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,320
Did you do it with Mani at last?

475
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,960
Is it a double meaning
or a single one?

476
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,360
Just a single meaning sir.

477
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,800
Okay, what happened after 3 weeks?

478
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,040
I joined my Father-in-law's company.

479
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,600
What was the job?

480
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,280
Why do you have to wear
a tie to the office?

481
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,680
Hey Noodle-Head!

482
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,320
This is the first time
I'm going for a work.

483
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,720
Going like this will create a
"Swag vibe" in front of uncle right?

484
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,040
Hey!

485
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,480
Where is the office?

486
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,480
This is the office.

487
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,200
This one?
- Yes, come.

488
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,400
Hey! Why do you have
western closets here?

489
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,840
Shouldn't it be inside?

490
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,200
Arjun!
These are our company products.

491
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,760
Didn't you say ceramics?

492
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,040
Toiletries are also ceramics.

493
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,680
Haven't you read about
this in school?

494
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,480
Come!

495
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,480
Good Morning Ma'am!
- Good Morning.

496
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,320
Hey Anu!

497
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,400
How can you just leave me and go?

498
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,400
Let me know what my job is.

499
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,120
Sorry! One second!

500
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,160
Teslyn!
- Yes ma'am!

501
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,840
Take him to dad.

502
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,920
Okay ma'am.

503
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,880
Dad will let you know about
your job, okay? All the best!

504
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,160
Okay!
- Bye!

505
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,520
Excuse me sir!

506
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,200
We should make sure the leg
doesn't slip while sitting on this.

507
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,080
Hey Arjun, come.

508
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,240
Come here no?
Jesus!

509
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,040
Sit!

510
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,920
Sit down no?

511
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,720
You mean here?

512
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,400
Yes, on that, sit now.

513
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,120
Remove your bag.

514
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,920
Remove it.

515
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,920
Sit now.

516
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,400
Sit properly.

517
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,000
Sit properly no?

518
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,120
Is the height okay?
- Okay!

519
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,240
Comfort?

520
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,400
Okay?

521
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,880
Uncle?

522
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,000
Grip?

523
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,640
It isn't slipping right?

524
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,560
In the front side?
- Uncle!

525
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,400
What are you doing uncle?

526
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,720
This is the only place
where a human sits in peace.

527
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:20,000
In that case, we have to check
comfort and quality no?

528
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,640
From now on you'll be doing
that job, what's the job called?

529
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,440
Quality check controller sir.
- Ya the same.

530
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,360
Uncle, how can I do all this?

531
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,200
Hey! I've been doing this
for the past 20 years.

532
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,960
Now your Uncle is ageing.

533
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,520
I'm not able to sit
because of the knee pain.

534
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,720
That's why I'm asking
you to take over.

535
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,560
All the best!

536
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,800
Son!

537
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,240
We should give the best
quality product to our customers.

538
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,520
We should like the quality
of that product first, understood?

539
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,240
Take care.
- Okay sir.

540
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:47,840
Hey!

541
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,840
You guys find my plight funny is it?

542
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,080
No dude, the way you feel
about it funny actually.

543
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,440
Hey Noodles-Head!

544
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,960
This job is very boring for me.

545
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,640
I don't think this will work for me.

546
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,520
The work will be boring for everyone
on their first day Arjun.

547
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,440
Then you'll get used to it.

548
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,080
Okay...

549
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,720
So you got used to it Arjun?

550
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,440
Yes I got used to it.

551
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,800
Got too much used to it.

552
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,360
Imagine how it'd be
if this is your job for 6 months.

553
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,560
It's extremely boring.

554
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,720
It is right? Think of my plight.

555
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:45,680
Even if it's my favorite teacher,

556
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,080
I would walk out of
the class if it's boring.

557
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,400
Nine hours a day

558
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,360
all you've to do is
sit down and stand up.

559
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,520
That too in a western closet.

560
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,680
How do you think it will feel?

561
00:34:52,386 --> 00:34:54,320
I'm not liking it.
Not able to throw it off too.

562
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,400
You ask why?
Commitment!

563
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,680
Okay, come let's sit and discuss.

564
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,120
No, I'll stand.

565
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,000
All that is fine

566
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,000
did you at least say "No"
to your wife for this?

567
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,640
For what?

568
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,032
You've been doing this

569
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:07,320
"Siting in closet"
job for 6 months no?

570
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,640
You don't like it right?

571
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,720
You could've said "No" to your wife
for this job right?

572
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,200
Already I haven't done anything sir.

573
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,160
If I say "No" to this...

574
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,800
She'll feel bad no sir?

575
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,760
Yes, you are right.

576
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,240
Then what else did you do?

577
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,360
I synced myself to a life timeline
that was not in sync.

578
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,360
Not good!
- Excuse me sir!

579
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,120
Some girl has come here seeking
a help sir, shall I send her in?

580
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,465
Okay, sir.

581
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,560
Hey! Sit in that.

582
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,360
Tomorrow we're getting
some load from Pune.

583
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,105
Okay.
- Check all of that properly.

584
00:35:43,185 --> 00:35:44,120
Okay, uncle.

585
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,640
Whatever issue Is there, we need to
return it immediately.- Arjun?

586
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:48,800
Meera!

587
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,120
You already know her?

588
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,320
I know her uncle.
- Then help her

589
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,040
out with whatever help
she wants I have a meeting.

590
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,360
What are you doing here?

591
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,000
Please don't ask me anything.

592
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,600
Please let me know
what help you need.

593
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,960
Arjun, I'm working as an assistant
to director Goutham Menon!

594
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,680
Really?

595
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,600
We're trying to find a similar
location for Sir's next movie...

596
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,160
It's a 6 day shoot

597
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,880
I was wondering
if we could get permission for it.

598
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,280
What do you mean 6 days,
you can take it for 60 days.

599
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,440
This is my company.

600
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,280
Your company?
- Yes!

601
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,080
Well I mean...

602
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,800
My father-in law's company
but don't worry, I'll take care.

603
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:38,080
Hey!
You got married?

604
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,560
How many shocks
are you planning to give in a day?

605
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,680
Anyways, thanks for the help.

606
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,680
Thanks to you.

607
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,800
I'm extremely bored here.

608
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,280
It'll be fun to
have a shooting here.

609
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,480
That's all?

610
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,400
Okay...Give me your phone number.

611
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,520
I will confirm everything and
give you a call in the evening.

612
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,600
Sure!

613
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:58,000
98410...
- 98410...

614
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,360
22...
- 22...

615
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,280
485...
- 4, 8 5!

616
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,680
Yes!
- Okay!

617
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,240
Who's this Meera?

618
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,760
School senior sir.

619
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,200
Childhood crush sir.

620
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,840
Blushes all over!

621
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,160
How did Meera photo come here?

622
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,600
Case study!
You go ahead!

623
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,320
Meera!

624
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,520
Well she was in my office...

625
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,440
Don't start off
like Goutham Menon, just go!

626
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,560
Packaging is in the upstairs...

627
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,880
Godown is in the downstairs.

628
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,280
This is the office cabin.

629
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,480
You can shoot wherever you want.

630
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,240
But Meera, I never expected
to meet you again.

631
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,080
The last time we met, I asked you
to add me on facebook

632
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,720
you never added me.
- Sorry!

633
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,880
I'll add now.
- Okay. Bye.

634
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,520
I'll take leave.
- Bye.

635
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,400
Bye!

636
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,400
Arjun!

637
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,680
Hey! Who was that?

638
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,880
She looks familiar.

639
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,520
It's Meera, our school senior?

640
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,960
We met her in the
pub the other day?

641
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,160
You forgot her, crackpot!

642
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,280
The one whom you called Akka?

643
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,280
That was back then,
now I called her Meera only.

644
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,200
Okay, so what was she doing here?

645
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,680
Well, she came here
to ask permission for shooting!

646
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,880
Shooting?
- Yes.

647
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,040
What did you say?

648
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,840
I said okay!
- What?

649
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,280
I said okay...
- You said okay?

650
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:25,280
Where will we work if we give away
the office for shooting Arjun?

651
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,040
Don't you think at all?

652
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,520
Hey Anu! Don't scream!

653
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,840
First of all, whom did you
ask before saying okay?

654
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,680
Uncle asked me to help her
with whatever she wants.

655
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,320
My dad?
- What happened Anu?

656
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,600
Dad, did you give permission
for a film shooting?

657
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:42,680
No dear!

658
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,840
Well!

659
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,440
You asked me to help her
with whatever she wants, uncle?

660
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,560
Yes Arjun!

661
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,240
But shouldn't you be
knowing our work will be

662
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,160
disturbed if we permit
film shooting here?

663
00:38:56,479 --> 00:38:57,440
Okay uncle!

664
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,720
I will call her and say
it's not possible.

665
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,200
Hello!

666
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,760
Yes tell me!

667
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,920
Sit down!
- Sir!

668
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,240
How can I sit in your chair?

669
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,040
No one has a permanent chair Arjun!

670
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,640
Sit down! Sit!

671
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:24,120
I feel...- My table is shabby,
why haven't you cleaned it up?

672
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,880
Sir, it's your table sir,
you should've cleaned it up.

673
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,240
You keep getting your work
done from others!

674
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,600
Okay... Come, come!

675
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,160
You wanted to ask him something no?
- Ask him! I somehow feel...

676
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,520
Dude, don't show the anger you have
on me to him, he's our customer.

677
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:35,960
I feel your wife wasn't angry because
you said okay for the shooting.

678
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,160
I think it's because of this Meera
in your life again.

679
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,000
I'm sure it's because of that.

680
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,800
Bother, looks like you are waiting
for someone from a very long time?

681
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,080
Yes bro!

682
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,120
Hi Meera!

683
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,960
Hi da! Just a minute!
- Okay!

684
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,160
What you want?

685
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,360
3 of this is enough!

686
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,440
Okay.

687
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,200
Thanks sister.
Note it down.

688
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,331
Okay!

689
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,800
What's up da?
You wanted to talk something?

690
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,680
What happened?

691
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:21,880
Meera!

692
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,960
I just... took it for granted
like it was my company

693
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,760
and said okay for the shooting.

694
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,600
But uh...

695
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,560
My uncle and my wife are

696
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,960
not okay with it.

697
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,760
So...

698
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:41,000
It's okay! You could've
told me about this on phone.

699
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,160
No! I felt I should
apologize to you in person.

700
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,240
So...!

701
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,720
Sorry Meera!

702
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:50,960
It's okay!

703
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,800
If I keep searching
for a couple of days

704
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,360
I will get the location.

705
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,040
Meera sister they're going to start
the movie aren't you coming?

706
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,680
I will come you go.
- Okay come soon.

707
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,080
Yes I'll be there.

708
00:41:07,789 --> 00:41:08,760
Arjun?

709
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,240
You want to join us for the movie?

710
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,120
Where?

711
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:17,320
'This is dinner room for eating'

712
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,880
'This is bath room'

713
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,800
This place is so good Meera!

714
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,680
Yes right?
- Yes!

715
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:34,040
I have a dream of watching
a movie here all alone.

716
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,440
'You will teach as...'

717
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,120
But it's always
a little crowded here.

718
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,920
'This is bedroom
You simply said that'

719
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,200
'You didn't tell
what it is used for'

720
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,480
Meera!

721
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,520
How did you get the
interest to work in cinemas?

722
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,040
Since my childhood I've always
liked storytelling Arjun!

723
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,480
Back in school and college

724
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,200
I used to direct dramas and

725
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,080
the same way we
used to get applause.

726
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,600
That's when I decided
I wanted to become a director.

727
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,640
Later I thought I'll give
it a shot and I'm giving it now.

728
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,320
Good morning madam.
- Good morning.

729
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,760
Even when I used
to get applause after

730
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,920
a stage performance
in school or college no?

731
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:31,320
That's when I started getting this
small dream of becoming an actor.

732
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:32,960
Really?

733
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,680
Have you ever
tried attending an audition?

734
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,640
I wish

735
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,600
but I haven't tried any.

736
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:40,560
Why?

737
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,640
I don't know Meera!

738
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,360
Middle class family!

739
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,960
If I ever go and tell my father
that I want to act in movies

740
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,800
thinking of his reaction
itself scares out of me.

741
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,440
Oh God!

742
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,280
Hey Hi!

743
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:08,480
Hi!

744
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,760
Where were you Arjun?
Why are you late?

745
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,080
I went to meet Meera!

746
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,200
For what?

747
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:24,720
For what?

748
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,840
Your company denied
permission for shooting right?

749
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,400
So I went to apologize to her.

750
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:34,960
You could've called her
on phone and said that right?

751
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,120
Hey!

752
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,240
I felt I should meet her in person
and say that so I did it.

753
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:41,920
Should I ask permission to you
and your dad for this?

754
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,120
Don't scream Arjun!

755
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,040
Didn't I ask you not
to scream in the office?

756
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,280
Did you listen to me?

757
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,640
Did you listen?

758
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:58,920
Suspicion?

759
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,720
You should suspect only
if she doesn't suspect.

760
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,080
Otherwise suspicion is very common.

761
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:06,080
Nothing you proceed.

762
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,040
What else sir...

763
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,120
The next one week she didn't
even talk to me properly.

764
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:38,800
How did you know that I was
working in toilets cleaning company?

765
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,200
Truly was you working
in toilets cleaning company?

766
00:44:41,413 --> 00:44:43,280
Hey!
Why did you change the channel?

767
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:44,400
'So I blabbered you?'

768
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:45,840
I don't like this song.

769
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:47,720
You like all of
A.R.Rahman songs right?

770
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,920
I don't like this particular
A.R.Rahman song.

771
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:50,840
Is that clear?

772
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,720
'It was something different.
- What?'

773
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,600
'I was handling
building contract profession.'

774
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:58,560
'Don't ruin my respect
and profession as well.'

775
00:44:58,640 --> 00:44:59,720
'Take your hands off.'

776
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,840
'Were you washing for camels?
It's so stinking.'

777
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,520
'Step back'
- Why are you torturing me?'

778
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,960
'Tell me what is this?'

779
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:06,920
Hey!

780
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,091
Dude...!
- Hey...!

781
00:45:09,171 --> 00:45:10,400
Hey Mani!
- Dude!

782
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:11,550
I've become a Mother now dude!

783
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:12,960
Sorry I made her a Mother.

784
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,720
Oh my God! Congrats.

785
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:18,120
Congrats dude!
- Thank you!

786
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:20,600
Hey Noodle.
- Good job Mani.

787
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:21,960
Hey give them sweets no?

788
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,600
Let's go?

789
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,400
Why do you have a strange look dude?

790
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:34,200
Why so much urgency dude?

791
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:35,320
Urgency?

792
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:36,440
Dude!

793
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:37,960
This is the next step in life.

794
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:42,480
I feel like I've achieved
something extraordinary.

795
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:49,640
No, she'll slipper me. Ghosh
I don't know how people smoke this.

796
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:52,800
What else dude?

797
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,440
When are you guys going
to plan for a baby?

798
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:56,520
You've no idea.

799
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:58,520
Nothing has happened between us.

800
00:45:58,600 --> 00:45:59,840
What? Nothing happened?

801
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,800
Dude!
Why are you screaming?

802
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:04,400
Nothing happened between you both?
Dude!

803
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:07,120
Your nerves are okay right?
Why don't you come to Doctor?

804
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:08,920
Damn it!

805
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:10,560
Then?

806
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:17,840
I'm not able to see our Noodle-Head
as my wife dude.

807
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:20,520
On top of that she's suspecting me.

808
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,360
Suspecting you?

809
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:23,600
Why?

810
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:29,920
Dude!
She's feeling very insecure.

811
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,720
I think that's why
she's suspecting you.

812
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:33,920
If everything happens
between you both no?

813
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,360
Then she'll become normal.

814
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,440
You should take the initiative dude.

815
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:39,560
Where's he looking at?

816
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:41,800
Dude you get it?
You need to take initiative.

817
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:45,120
Hey! Dude!

818
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,440
You should be taking the initiative.

819
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:48,720
You get it?

820
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:39,720
Who the hell is that?!

821
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:53,280
Sir, I tried with utmost sincerity.

822
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:55,040
We got a call at
the wrong timing sir.

823
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:57,120
Oh so you got a call from Meera
at the wrong timing?

824
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,400
Is it okay if she calls when Your
wife Is not around?

825
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:01,320
Bro!

826
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:02,680
When it comes to romance

827
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:05,480
you've to do it in a cute
and flavored manner.

828
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:06,480
Here take it!

829
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:08,280
It shouldn't sound
like a favor like this.

830
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:09,640
Get lost you dust bin!

831
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:40,320
Hello!

832
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:48,600
Where's the drop brother?

833
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:50,080
Royapuram.

834
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:52,240
Royapuram...

835
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:54,840
How to go to Royapuram brother?

836
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:56,400
Hey!

837
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:57,960
You're driving a cab in Chennai

838
00:48:58,040 --> 00:48:59,400
don't you even know Royapuram?

839
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:01,920
Don't get angry brother.

840
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:04,480
It's been just a week since
I came to this city.

841
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:07,800
Okay, go I'll tell you.

842
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:09,760
Thanks brother.

843
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:13,200
Go straight for 2 KM and
take a left in the junction.

844
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,200
Sorry brother that was...

845
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:24,280
I showed my office
frustration towards you.

846
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:25,360
Sorry!

847
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:26,680
That's okay brother.

848
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:30,600
Well...

849
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,480
Don't be mad that

850
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:34,240
I'm giving you an advice.

851
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:37,720
When you go to work be really happy.

852
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,680
We should do our job with
full 'LOVE' brother.

853
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:42,840
That's when life
becomes interesting.

854
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:45,440
I don't like the work I do brother.

855
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,040
Why?
- That's my problem.

856
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:50,280
Then do the job you like brother.

857
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:06,960
Why are you smiling brother?

858
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:09,520
Nothing but...

859
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,560
A friend of mine
works in the movies...

860
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:14,400
I told her I'm interested in acting.

861
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,480
I haven't tried anything so far.

862
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:19,320
Now all of a sudden she
calls me up for an audition.

863
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,440
Then go and give it a try brother.

864
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:23,480
Brother!

865
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:26,080
My folks will create
a big issue out of it brother.

866
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,080
So what?

867
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:28,680
Stop thinking about
your folks brother.

868
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,360
You really want to
give it a shot right?

869
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,360
Then go give it a shot brother!

870
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:37,600
At least you'll be happy
that you tried what you liked right?

871
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:43,720
By the way bro!

872
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:46,320
Is driving cab your favorite job?

873
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:48,400
No brother!

874
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:51,000
This is like a part- time job.

875
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,080
My dream is totally different.

876
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:03,480
This is like our dreams
and ambitions floating in the air

877
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,560
suddenly coming out
of a stranger's mouth.

878
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:07,000
You could've listened
to the cab driver's words

879
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:08,360
and gone to the audition no?

880
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:13,000
Brat!

881
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:14,560
You went to the audition right?

882
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Tell me dude!

883
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:21,760
Hi! You go in next switch off
your phone before you go.

884
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:23,880
Meera!

885
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:32,480
I thought you wouldn't come.

886
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:35,640
I felt I should give it a shot
So...

887
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:38,880
Okay! Wait here.

888
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:40,440
Meera!

889
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:43,560
I haven't prepared
any scene to perform.

890
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:45,880
Give me a scene no?

891
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:47,000
I'll manage.

892
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:49,880
A scene...

893
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:57,600
Here!
Prepare for this scene.

894
00:51:58,120 --> 00:51:59,840
Okay?
- Meera!

895
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,360
This scene has female characters?

896
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:07,240
Prepare for your character
I'll take care of the rest.

897
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:08,760
Then come let's prepare together.

898
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:10,800
Dude! This is my story.

899
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,560
Switch off your phone
while you come inside.

900
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:25,240
[indistinct chatter]

901
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:27,760
Meera!
- Sir?

902
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:29,280
How many are left?
- 12 more sir.

903
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:30,520
Ask them to come.

904
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,280
Yes! Sit!

905
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:41,000
What's your name?

906
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:42,400
Arjun!

907
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:44,680
Arjun sir.

908
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:45,800
Okay!

909
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:47,680
Ready to perform?

910
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:50,920
What's the scene?
- Pa...ba...Break-up scene sir.

911
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:54,840
Okay!

912
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:57,520
Okay! Let's see.

913
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:04,560
Is it the first time?

914
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:08,520
Relax! Okay?

915
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:11,400
Forget about the fact that
you're surrounded by 8-10 people.

916
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:14,440
Just get transported into that
character and its world.

917
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:16,280
Okay? Relax!

918
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:18,120
Close your eyes take a deep breath.

919
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:19,160
Yeah?

920
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:23,080
Go for it.

921
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:24,800
And...

922
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,120
Action!

923
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:41,480
'Hello!'
- Tell me Preethi.

924
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:43,160
'Achu, what happened to the match?'

925
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:46,800
I lost it.

926
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:49,560
'Okay leave it
There's always a next match.'

927
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:51,840
'You aren't hurt right?'

928
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,160
What if I get hurt now?

929
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:54,560
'Why are you screaming now?'

930
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,600
'I just asked you out of concern.'

931
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:00,840
My problem in itself is the love
and concern you shower me with.

932
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:05,960
Preethi!

933
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:13,000
Before you entered my life
boxing was my everything.

934
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:19,280
My focus was completely on boxing.

935
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:22,760
But now?

936
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:30,040
My vision is completely
surrounded by you.

937
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:38,240
Before this I've won a few
and lost a few Preethi.

938
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:44,720
But... I've never
had the fear of losing.

939
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:48,880
Now I have that fear.

940
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:55,680
I'm scared what if something happens
and I don't get to live with you.

941
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:03,760
That fear is making me lose
even before I enter the ring.

942
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:16,560
I can't let my dream go off Preethi.

943
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:21,760
You...

944
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:24,200
I don't want this love.

945
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:26,280
'Arvind!'

946
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:28,440
'Don't be impulsive.'

947
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:30,600
'Whatever it is come
let's meet and...'

948
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:31,640
I don't want it.

949
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,920
If I see you in person
I will want you.

950
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,120
'Okay.'

951
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:44,320
'But do you think
you can forget me?'

952
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:54,120
'Arvind!'

953
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:04,520
You're a natural Arjun.

954
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:07,360
You performed well.

955
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:09,840
I'll let you know.

956
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:11,120
We'll work.

957
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:12,480
Yeah?

958
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:14,680
But... Really...

959
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:16,000
Good job!

960
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:19,920
'After a long time I heard the
sound of applause in my life sir.'

961
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:22,520
'She's the reason for that.'

962
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:26,720
'All of a sudden she looked
very different to my eyes.'

963
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:30,440
'I didn't know if it was
love or something else.'

964
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:33,520
'But I felt she was
the right girl for me.'

965
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:38,360
Hey...!
- Baby!

966
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,600
You didn't live with
the girl you married.

967
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:45,600
You wanted to live
with the girl you liked.

968
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:47,560
There's nothing wrong in that.

969
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:49,480
Sir! Nothing like that sir.

970
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,040
What I did was very wrong.

971
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:52,600
Myself wanting her was unethical.

972
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:54,400
That's the truth.
I don't want to hide anything.

973
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:07,520
Thanks Meera!

974
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:09,920
For what?

975
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:12,760
If you hadn't come
back in my life...

976
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:15,040
I would've stayed forever
in a job that I didn't like.

977
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:18,040
It's just now

978
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:20,360
that I feel like
doing what I like.

979
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:21,920
I've got my senses working now.

980
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,680
After this I'm planning
to try things in a full swing.

981
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:27,760
You're a good actor Arjun.

982
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:30,320
Please try you'll get
a lot of opportunities.

983
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:38,200
Hey, you gave me a scene
for that audition right?

984
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:39,720
That scene was superb!

985
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,960
You can do that story as a movie no?
It'll be a runaway hit.

986
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:44,200
That's not possible.

987
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:46,040
Why?

988
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:49,720
I tried to make it into
a movie a year back.

989
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:53,080
The shooting stopped in 10 days.

990
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:55,200
Hey just don't bluff.

991
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:58,640
I'm not bluffing
I'm serious.

992
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:02,800
A producer asked me to make
a movie with his son as the hero.

993
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:06,720
The minute I saw him I knew
he wouldn't fit into my story.

994
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:10,920
But I didn't want to miss
an opportunity that knocked my door.

995
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:14,720
One day while shooting
he didn't perform well.

996
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,680
I yelled at him
in front of everyone.

997
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:19,480
His ego hit him hard as
to how can I yell at him.

998
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:21,520
He stopped the movie.

999
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:25,920
Okay...

1000
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,120
You can start it off
with a new producer right?

1001
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:33,680
Life gives you second chances Arjun!

1002
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:36,800
But not cinema.

1003
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:44,920
Excuse me.

1004
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:49,440
Hey! Meera!

1005
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:55,920
Meera!

1006
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:59,480
Meera don't lose hope. You'll
definitely get a second chance.

1007
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:04,760
Not only in cinema Arjun.

1008
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:07,320
Even in life I didn't
get what I wished for.

1009
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:22,640
Okay, take care!

1010
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:38,920
Anu!

1011
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:44,640
Hey! It's nothing like
what you think...

1012
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:55,120
Why did you slap me?

1013
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:58,600
You didn't come to office.

1014
00:59:58,680 --> 00:59:59,920
Your phone was switched off!

1015
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,960
Without knowing where you went
and what happened...

1016
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:04,560
I searched all over the city and at
last came here to the see the site of

1017
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:07,440
you getting drunk and having
fun with a random girl.

1018
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:10,600
You want me to cuddle you
instead of slapping you?

1019
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:12,960
Hey! Don't talk rubbish!

1020
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:14,720
Oh, Am I speaking rubbish?

1021
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:17,680
Okay! There's nothing
between you both right?

1022
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:19,640
Call her right now and say
'Akka' (Elder sister)

1023
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:20,960
Do it right now.

1024
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:23,440
For God's sake please understand.

1025
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:25,720
There's nothing like what you think.

1026
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:29,760
Because of her I got an audition
today and got a chance to perform.

1027
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:30,800
What?

1028
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:32,720
Wait wait wait
What?

1029
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:35,280
You got an opportunity to act?

1030
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:40,360
Oh, so you have an excuse to
roam around with her right?

1031
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:41,920
Hey!

1032
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:43,840
Don't suspect me
without understanding.

1033
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:47,080
I'm interested in acting
so I gave it a shot.

1034
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:48,440
That's it.

1035
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:51,000
If you're that much interested

1036
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:52,680
why didn't you
try all these days?

1037
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:54,800
Why is this passion popping
out after her arrival?

1038
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:56,040
Why?

1039
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:57,960
It's not because of her arrival.

1040
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:01,360
When I work for your company
and go through hell...

1041
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:04,080
I realized...I should
be doing what I like.

1042
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:06,880
Going further I can't go
check the comfort level

1043
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:08,640
of a toilet closet
with your dad.

1044
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:09,680
Got it?

1045
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:15,360
You don't have the eligibility
to talk about my dad.

1046
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:28,535
Hey!

1047
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:37,640
I'm not eligible?

1048
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:39,160
As if you own the Apple company.

1049
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:40,680
You're just making toiletries right?

1050
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:42,400
This eligibility is more
than enough for that.

1051
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:45,640
If a duffer like you
is treated with a job

1052
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:47,440
and a wife this is how you'll talk.

1053
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:06,520
Did I ask for it?

1054
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:37,480
Did I ask for you to marry me?

1055
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:40,400
Did I come to your
dad and seek for a job?

1056
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:43,120
I just nodded my head to
whatever you guys said.

1057
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:44,560
I'm not eligible.

1058
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:50,520
I shouldn't have
got married at all.

1059
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:52,560
Correct!

1060
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:53,920
Correct!

1061
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
If you hadn't got married
you could've been with her.

1062
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:57,680
You could've done anything you want.

1063
01:02:57,960 --> 01:02:59,680
Now that I'm here to question you

1064
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:01,440
that's what is irritating you.

1065
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:07,520
After so many explanations
you still talk about her?

1066
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:09,760
Yes!

1067
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:12,840
If I hadn't married you
I would've fallen for her.

1068
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:14,440
You got it?

1069
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:18,960
Then why the hell did
you accept the other day?

1070
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:23,040
If you had said 'No'
I would've happily married

1071
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:25,040
the guy chosen by my dad no?

1072
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:28,240
It's not too late.

1073
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:30,240
You can still divorce
me and marry the guy

1074
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:31,720
chosen by your dad
and live peacefully.

1075
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:34,080
Divorce? Divorce?

1076
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:39,680
So you've started thinking that far?

1077
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:45,480
Yes!

1078
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:48,800
Without being in love or
having an understanding

1079
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:51,040
being in this
marriage is pointless.

1080
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:55,880
We can instead get divorced
for God's sake and live peacefully.

1081
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:05,440
So you don't...

1082
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:07,080
So you don't love me at all?

1083
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:14,160
No!

1084
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:16,160
'14th floor'

1085
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:23,200
To summarize in short

1086
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:25,560
without knowing if you're in
love with a girl or not

1087
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:27,680
and getting married to
her was your blunder.

1088
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:30,320
So you're the sole reason
for all the problem.

1089
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:31,480
Isn't it?
- Yes!

1090
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:36,320
How did you manage
to pile it upon me sir?

1091
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:39,560
I'm married to a person who
is supposed to be my friend

1092
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:41,640
and it was destined that way
by the guy above all of us...

1093
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,320
That guy is the sole reason.

1094
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:49,840
It's not the guy above us!

1095
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:51,800
It's the guy right opposite to you.

1096
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:54,600
This guy?
- Yes!

1097
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:56,840
Damn it! What did he do?
Poor fellow!

1098
01:04:56,920 --> 01:05:00,040
You said the fault is of the
guy above all of us right?

1099
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:01,360
That's me.

1100
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:06,880
You...You mean...

1101
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:08,560
God?

1102
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:11,200
Kadavul? (God?)

1103
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:13,080
If you'll understand
only through that term

1104
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:15,040
and if you wish so then let it be.

1105
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:20,080
Sir? You?

1106
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:21,440
Another God!

1107
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:27,040
Another God?
- Yes.

1108
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:44,600
You!

1109
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:47,000
For the buildup you
both gave I thought

1110
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:48,920
you guys are some Hi-Tech Swamijis.

1111
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:52,080
I thought you will give me some
holy ashes and make my life better.

1112
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:55,320
But you guys went a step ahead
and claim to be God!

1113
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:00,960
At last you're trying to
trick me into it right?

1114
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:05,560
Gods?
- Yes!

1115
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:08,760
Oh my God!

1116
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:11,960
He's doing well no?

1117
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:13,480
Love Court!

1118
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:17,600
I'm getting late for the court
so I'm leaving. But...

1119
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,320
Thanks for the entertainment.

1120
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:23,560
Kadavul (God)?

1121
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:26,520
Hey Arjun!

1122
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:27,560
I don't have time.

1123
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:28,560
Arjun wait no?

1124
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:29,840
Get lost.

1125
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:32,440
You'll believe I'm a God only
if you see some magic, right?

1126
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:03,720
Long live!

1127
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:55,000
Don't be scared.

1128
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:57,360
We've come here to help you.

1129
01:07:57,800 --> 01:07:59,560
According to you I'm at fault right?

1130
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:02,120
I'll correct the mistakes I did.

1131
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:15,440
To make your life as you wish...

1132
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:18,080
I'm giving you a second chance.

1133
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:20,720
This ticket.

1134
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:22,480
You don't get it right?

1135
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:24,960
This is a ticket for journey
of your life ahead.

1136
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:27,080
You still don't get it right?

1137
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:29,000
You won't get it.
Take that.

1138
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:32,080
Boss!
Tell him the condition.

1139
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:34,400
Condition number 1.

1140
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:36,560
This ticket should
always stay with you.

1141
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:37,920
Condition number 2.

1142
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:41,680
You should never utter a word about
this second chance to anyone else.

1143
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,240
Condition number 3.

1144
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:45,840
If you leak it you'll die.

1145
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:05,560
Arjun!

1146
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:09,080
Arjun!

1147
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:22,240
Arjun, why are you screaming?

1148
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:25,360
It's a bad dream.

1149
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:54,040
Arjun!

1150
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:57,080
You haven't said anything about
what I asked for.

1151
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:58,080
About what?

1152
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:01,080
About us getting married!

1153
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:07,320
I can't get married to you Anu!

1154
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:14,240
Give me one good reason
to say 'No' to me.

1155
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:15,600
One reason?

1156
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:16,800
We both have already been...

1157
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:18,520
You tell you die!

1158
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:21,120
What are you doing?

1159
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:24,720
You need to be in
love to get married Anu.

1160
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:25,960
We both are friends.

1161
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:27,480
Being the same till the end

1162
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:29,720
will be good for you
good for me and

1163
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:31,200
good for everyone around.

1164
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:37,480
You're not blabbering
because you're high right?

1165
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:41,320
I make more sense when I'm high Anu!

1166
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:44,360
Bye!

1167
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:57,520
Bro, let's go bro!

1168
01:10:58,240 --> 01:11:00,360
Let's go, Let's go, let's go bro!

1169
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:02,960
What happened?

1170
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:13,440
I will you throw
you off the auto.

1171
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:19,320
Dude! What's your problem?

1172
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:20,920
Brother!

1173
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,240
You wouldn't get it if I say bro!

1174
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:30,720
I don't want the money,
I'll take leave.

1175
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,960
What a mad guy!

1176
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:46,800
My hall!

1177
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:51,160
My watch!

1178
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:53,400
My TV!

1179
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:56,120
Sofa!

1180
01:11:57,720 --> 01:11:59,320
My house!

1181
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:04,280
I'm back!

1182
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:08,720
Oh my kadavule! (God)

1183
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:11,800
Mom!

1184
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:15,080
Dad!

1185
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:19,000
My room!

1186
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:29,720
Double cot!
Married man!

1187
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:31,600
Single cot!

1188
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:33,720
Single man!

1189
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,200
Hey, add me on facebook? Bye!

1190
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:40,720
Single man! Me!

1191
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:53,840
He needs an alarm
to wake up at 11:00 am!

1192
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:54,960
Arjun!

1193
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:57,240
Hey Arjun!
Wake up!

1194
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:02,360
Mom?

1195
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:03,400
What's up?

1196
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Mom!

1197
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:08,320
What's up?

1198
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:11,960
Mom!
- What happened?

1199
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:17,800
Crackpot! Take bath and come
have your breakfast.

1200
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:20,040
Mom...!
- Hey...!

1201
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:21,560
What happened?

1202
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:23,760
What happened to him?

1203
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:36,720
Hey Arjun!

1204
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:40,520
Come back soon in the evening,
dad wanted to talk to you.

1205
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:42,600
Hey!

1206
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:45,840
I'm talking to you, and what are
you looking at in your empty hand?

1207
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:50,480
You can't see this?

1208
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:52,480
No!

1209
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:56,000
You can see only if
something is there right?

1210
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:59,480
Hey! I'm noticing you since morning,
you sound very different.

1211
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:01,920
Hey! Did you drink last night?

1212
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:06,440
No, no, I didn't drink.

1213
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:08,960
Here, have some dosas.

1214
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:14,160
Oh my God!

1215
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:18,560
It's been so long since I had
dosas made by you.

1216
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,360
You should eat her dosas!
- If you leak the truth!

1217
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:24,440
What are you doing?

1218
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:30,520
You won't get it Mom!

1219
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:35,480
He sure would've gotten
drunk last night.

1220
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:51,560
Brother, looks like you are waiting
for someone for a very long time!

1221
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,720
No! Nothing like that.

1222
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,280
Okay!

1223
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:06,320
It's him Mani!

1224
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:08,480
Tell me dude!
- What's up dude?

1225
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:10,520
You said "Yes" to Anu?
- No dude!

1226
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:11,680
Why?

1227
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:14,320
I like Meera!
- What?

1228
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:15,960
You mean Meera akka?

1229
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:17,080
Hey!

1230
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:18,000
Meera!

1231
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:20,120
After so many years you met
her yesterday only at the bar!

1232
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:21,720
How can you fall in love
with her so quickly?

1233
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:23,840
Dude, I don't know
how to make you...

1234
01:15:25,240 --> 01:15:26,400
You won't get it dude!

1235
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:27,720
I won't get it?

1236
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:33,480
Dude, don't be kidding,
she's elder than you.

1237
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:35,120
Listen to me, this won't work out.

1238
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:36,960
Hey!

1239
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:40,120
Even if she's elder than me,
she's one of a kind, dude.

1240
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:43,200
Why do you behave like this?
- Okay, I need to go now, bye, bye

1241
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:07,440
Meera!

1242
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:09,920
Arjun!

1243
01:16:10,160 --> 01:16:11,320
What are you doing here?

1244
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,680
Friend's house, It's very close by!

1245
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,400
I've never seen you here.

1246
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:18,760
Even I've never seen you here.

1247
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:22,000
Okay, we'll catch up later
Bye!

1248
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:24,560
Bye!

1249
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:35,240
Arjun!

1250
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:40,480
Arjun!

1251
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:45,520
Sorry, my bike isn't starting, I've
an important work, can you drop me?

1252
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:47,280
Sorry to ask dude!

1253
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:49,400
What?

1254
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:51,080
Sure Meera!

1255
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:00,400
What happened?

1256
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:21,720
Why are you so tensed Meera?

1257
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:23,400
Well Arjun!

1258
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:25,840
I've got a producer who is
ready to produce my movie.

1259
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:28,800
He said, he will sign the agreement
today and introduce me to the hero.

1260
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:30,360
It won't be nice if I go late right?

1261
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:32,520
Hey, don't worry about all
that, we'll go fast...

1262
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:34,520
We'll get a second
chance in life Arjun!

1263
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:37,640
But in cinema...

1264
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:40,600
Move man!
- Arjun, move Arjun!

1265
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:42,400
Go! Just a minute.

1266
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:48,760
Well, how to tell her, I can't
be explicit about it.

1267
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:55,640
Meera!

1268
01:17:57,360 --> 01:18:02,040
Nowadays producers are torturing
to make their sons as Heroes.

1269
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:04,920
Directors also say okay for it
and the film gets dropped

1270
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,240
and they're stranded in
the middle of the road.

1271
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:08,600
Why do you jinx it?

1272
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:12,520
No, that's what I heard, so

1273
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:14,080
be careful Meera!

1274
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:25,360
Thank you!

1275
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:26,440
For what?

1276
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:27,840
For confusing me!

1277
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:29,720
Hey!

1278
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:34,320
[indistinct chatter]

1279
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:41,880
Can I come with you?

1280
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:44,280
But you should not talk.

1281
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:45,600
Come!

1282
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:57,000
No thanks!

1283
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:08,400
You can take care of all that.
- Okay

1284
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:10,320
Welcome, come inside.

1285
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:12,360
Come inside soon dear, auspicious
time is closing in.

1286
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:13,280
Come come!

1287
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:17,840
Where is that agreement?

1288
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:19,640
Oh it's here!

1289
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:21,480
Come come!

1290
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,720
Here, pray to the God and
sign the agreement.

1291
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:31,480
Everything is perfect dear.

1292
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:39,880
Well sir, you didn't
tell me who the Hero is.

1293
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:43,600
Well, who else dear, it's my son.
Hey come in son!

1294
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:45,400
Here he is!

1295
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:47,000
Here's my lion cub!

1296
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:53,080
What a style?
How's he?

1297
01:19:57,840 --> 01:19:58,760
Sign it dear.

1298
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:00,040
Sign it before the auspicious
time closes in.

1299
01:20:00,120 --> 01:20:01,400
Sign it dear.

1300
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:06,880
Sign, sign!

1301
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:15,720
Sign, sign!

1302
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:31,600
What happened?

1303
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:35,440
Well, it happened
just like you said.

1304
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:38,200
That's what is confusing me.

1305
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:41,440
Well...Leave that,
what happened inside?

1306
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:43,000
Did you sign the agreement?

1307
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,120
What's there to think in this?

1308
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:47,760
You think that guy will
fit into your story?

1309
01:20:51,640 --> 01:20:52,720
Will he?

1310
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:54,400
Then what?

1311
01:20:56,160 --> 01:20:57,920
It's very difficult to get a chance.

1312
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,520
I'm thinking why I should let it go.

1313
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:01,000
Oh lord, Meera!

1314
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:04,880
I'll tell you what the
experienced have told me.

1315
01:21:05,720 --> 01:21:07,120
You'll get a second
chance in life

1316
01:21:08,240 --> 01:21:09,360
but in cinema?

1317
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:13,720
Don't be impulsive Meera!

1318
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:16,880
Please! Think well!

1319
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:17,920
Hello!

1320
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:19,960
Sign the papers soon.

1321
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:22,160
It's getting late.
- Just a minute.

1322
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:26,320
How long will you take?

1323
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:34,480
Well, don't mistake me!

1324
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:36,160
I'm not interested to
make a film with you.

1325
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:37,280
Sorry!

1326
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:39,000
Come on!

1327
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:45,320
Hey! Stop right there.

1328
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:47,640
What a bad attitude you have huh?

1329
01:21:47,720 --> 01:21:50,960
In spite of being a girl we
decided to give you a chance

1330
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:52,680
and you throw
an attitude like that?

1331
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:54,720
In spite of being a girl?

1332
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:58,200
Thanks to you I didn't sign it.

1333
01:21:58,600 --> 01:21:59,920
Hey!

1334
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,840
I'll see to it you never
make a movie ever.

1335
01:22:14,440 --> 01:22:16,160
Hey! Catch hold of her.

1336
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:18,120
You can't hurt a girl bro,
get inside.

1337
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:25,600
You should've seen his face when
you showed him your middle finger.

1338
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:26,880
Oh my God!

1339
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:29,280
You've got so much guts Meera!

1340
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:31,200
I'm amazed.

1341
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:35,600
Okay, you've been
roaming around with me

1342
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:37,040
since morning,
don't you have office?

1343
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:38,280
Oh you didn't know.

1344
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:40,440
I cleared my college arrears
yesterday only.

1345
01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:44,440
Also...I'm interested in acting.

1346
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:46,880
That's why I wanted to give
it a shot. Guide me if you can.

1347
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:48,160
Oh!

1348
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,400
You used to act really
well in school right?

1349
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:53,240
Arjun, you're a good actor.

1350
01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:55,400
Do try, you'll get a lot
of opportunities.

1351
01:22:56,120 --> 01:22:57,560
Same words.

1352
01:22:58,600 --> 01:22:59,720
I don't get it.

1353
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:02,120
You won't get it Meera!

1354
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:07,920
Thank you.

1355
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:15,240
Arjun, come up and leave
after the rain stops.

1356
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:16,480
No, it's okay Meera!

1357
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:18,040
Don't be silly, come!

1358
01:24:33,680 --> 01:24:35,520
I feel like this rain
should never stop!

1359
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:37,280
Why?

1360
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:39,800
Well...

1361
01:24:39,880 --> 01:24:42,640
If it keeps raining in Chennai

1362
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:45,360
we won't have this
water scarcity, right?

1363
01:24:58,880 --> 01:24:59,920
Meera!

1364
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,680
What's your phone number?
- Note it down.

1365
01:25:02,440 --> 01:25:04,720
98410
- 98410...

1366
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:06,120
22...
- 22...

1367
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:07,400
485!

1368
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:12,440
How do you know?

1369
01:25:16,240 --> 01:25:18,240
Oh, it's correct?

1370
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:22,200
Coincidence.

1371
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:27,400
Rain has stopped Meera!

1372
01:25:28,640 --> 01:25:30,920
I'll take leave.
Thanks for the coffee.

1373
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:34,240
Arjun!

1374
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:40,720
If I hadn't met you today

1375
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:43,120
I would've made a wrong
decision in my life.

1376
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:51,920
But whatever happened today doesn't
seem like coincidence to me.

1377
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:53,840
I swear it's coincidence Meera!

1378
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:56,400
Maybe it's all God's plan.

1379
01:25:56,760 --> 01:25:58,400
Yeah, we can say that too.

1380
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:00,440
Thank you Arjun!

1381
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:08,120
Hey!

1382
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:10,120
This is Sruti!

1383
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:11,160
My best friend!

1384
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:13,120
This is Arjun!
My school junior.

1385
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:35,560
Hey! Sit down.

1386
01:26:41,960 --> 01:26:43,560
Finally you've cleared your arrears.

1387
01:26:44,120 --> 01:26:47,320
Don't sit at home like a duffer,
apply for jobs.

1388
01:26:53,640 --> 01:26:54,640
Dad!

1389
01:26:57,040 --> 01:26:58,760
I want to get into acting dad.
- What?

1390
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:00,040
You're going to study?

1391
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:02,520
You took 6 years for engineering.

1392
01:27:02,600 --> 01:27:04,000
What else are you going to study?

1393
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:05,200
Not studying dad

1394
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:07,040
Acting

1395
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:09,600
What did you say?

1396
01:27:10,040 --> 01:27:11,160
You're going to act?

1397
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:12,920
Are you nuts?

1398
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:14,800
Saying acting, damn it!

1399
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:17,840
No dad.

1400
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:20,360
From childhood I've this
dream of acting.

1401
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:23,000
At least I'll try now no?

1402
01:27:23,080 --> 01:27:26,840
Hey, I'm noticing from the morning,
your behavior is very strange.

1403
01:27:26,920 --> 01:27:29,040
Why do we've to go through
this cinema dear?

1404
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:30,960
Get a job, get and work and
settle down in life...

1405
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:32,160
I can't Mom.

1406
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:35,160
I've experienced how boring life is
if I live the way you say.

1407
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:36,600
I've told you not to tell!

1408
01:27:49,160 --> 01:27:51,240
Life will be irritating Mom.

1409
01:27:52,680 --> 01:27:54,640
What?
- Irritating?

1410
01:27:54,720 --> 01:27:56,200
Then why did we have
to make you study engineering?

1411
01:27:56,280 --> 01:27:57,560
For what sake?
- No.

1412
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:04,680
Please dad.

1413
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:07,240
I'll just try for a year.

1414
01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:15,680
What do you say?

1415
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:20,040
What's all this?

1416
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:43,200
Tell me dude!

1417
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:44,320
Arjun!

1418
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:46,720
I said okay to marry Matthew.

1419
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:49,040
Next week is the engagement.

1420
01:28:49,160 --> 01:28:50,960
I called you to just say that.

1421
01:28:51,320 --> 01:28:52,440
Nothing else.

1422
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:54,040
Anu!

1423
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:55,440
She's gone.
- Hey!

1424
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:56,760
Why did you put her on conference?

1425
01:28:56,840 --> 01:28:58,160
Why are you avoiding her call?

1426
01:28:58,400 --> 01:29:00,120
What? You are prioritizing a
potential girlfriend over a friend?

1427
01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:01,120
Damn it!

1428
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:02,800
Then what?
- Dude!

1429
01:29:03,720 --> 01:29:04,800
You won't get it dude!

1430
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:05,760
I won't get it?

1431
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:07,440
You're the one who is
messed up since morning.

1432
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:09,480
Hey what happened? - You suddenly
fall in love with Meera Akka?

1433
01:29:09,560 --> 01:29:10,600
You're avoiding Anu?

1434
01:29:10,680 --> 01:29:11,880
What happened to you?

1435
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:13,440
She just asked you if
you'll marry her.

1436
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:15,320
Say 'Yes' if you want to,
or else just go.

1437
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:17,960
Dude!

1438
01:29:18,200 --> 01:29:19,440
Anu is our friend, okay?

1439
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:20,800
Don't forget that, okay?

1440
01:29:21,080 --> 01:29:22,480
Crackpot.

1441
01:29:53,640 --> 01:29:55,360
Baby, just one peg baby!

1442
01:29:55,760 --> 01:29:57,680
Why do you always
beg for the peg Mani?

1443
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:58,920
Baby!

1444
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:00,240
Just one!

1445
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:01,320
Okay, go ahead.

1446
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:02,440
I will.

1447
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:08,880
I thought you won't come.

1448
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:12,040
Come!

1449
01:30:12,280 --> 01:30:14,320
Hey! Be calm.

1450
01:30:15,880 --> 01:30:16,880
Hey!
- Hi!

1451
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:18,480
How're you?
- I'm good.

1452
01:30:24,280 --> 01:30:25,320
Tell me now!

1453
01:30:25,400 --> 01:30:26,960
Why did you avoid her?

1454
01:30:28,680 --> 01:30:30,000
You won't get it dude.

1455
01:30:30,080 --> 01:30:32,280
Baby, he's annoying me.

1456
01:30:33,160 --> 01:30:34,440
Hey, Anu is here.

1457
01:30:57,680 --> 01:30:58,680
Why is she avoiding me?

1458
01:30:58,760 --> 01:31:00,880
You did it right?
It's her turn now.

1459
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:05,520
Coming out for a smoke?

1460
01:31:06,120 --> 01:31:07,520
Let's go.

1461
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:20,520
What?

1462
01:31:22,040 --> 01:31:23,320
What?

1463
01:31:24,120 --> 01:31:26,320
Matthew No!
- Come.

1464
01:31:26,840 --> 01:31:28,000
Matthew!

1465
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:15,760
Look at him no?

1466
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:18,000
Though he looks like a
temple cow with blazers on

1467
01:32:18,440 --> 01:32:20,000
he seems like a nice guy right?

1468
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:24,400
Why do you have this dull face now?

1469
01:32:29,320 --> 01:32:31,280
But it doesn't look good to
see you both like this dude.

1470
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:33,120
It's very annoying.

1471
01:32:33,720 --> 01:32:35,200
Do something and talk to her no?

1472
01:32:37,880 --> 01:32:39,120
You get it?

1473
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:41,240
What did you understand?

1474
01:32:42,280 --> 01:32:44,440
If I ask something,
you keep saying I won't get it.

1475
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:45,600
I'm not up for this.

1476
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:20,440
Hey Arjun, come in.

1477
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:22,560
Is Anu here... Uncle?

1478
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:26,080
Anu has gone out with Matthew,
she'll be back, you come inside.

1479
01:33:26,160 --> 01:33:27,720
It's okay uncle,
I'll come once Anu is back.

1480
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:29,160
Hey, come in now.

1481
01:33:31,320 --> 01:33:32,280
Come.

1482
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:33,400
Sit down.

1483
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:37,320
Whisky?

1484
01:33:37,400 --> 01:33:38,440
No, I'm good uncle.

1485
01:33:38,520 --> 01:33:39,600
It's a scotch dude.

1486
01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:41,200
I've to drive back uncle.

1487
01:33:43,320 --> 01:33:44,400
Okay!

1488
01:33:45,200 --> 01:33:46,280
Jesus!

1489
01:33:48,200 --> 01:33:49,280
Cheers dude!

1490
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:55,600
Anu told me.

1491
01:33:55,960 --> 01:33:57,360
That you've cleared
all your arrears.

1492
01:33:57,680 --> 01:33:58,760
Yes uncle.

1493
01:33:59,080 --> 01:34:00,560
Why don't you join in my company?

1494
01:34:03,360 --> 01:34:04,440
Hey!

1495
01:34:05,160 --> 01:34:06,360
If you're not interested it's fine.

1496
01:34:06,440 --> 01:34:08,000
Why are you over reacting?

1497
01:34:08,080 --> 01:34:09,080
Sit down.

1498
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:12,040
Why are you not interested?

1499
01:34:14,640 --> 01:34:15,680
I'm interested in acting Uncle.

1500
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:17,680
So...I'm planning to pursue that.

1501
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:19,440
Very good.

1502
01:34:20,080 --> 01:34:22,800
If you don't take a risk
at this age, then when else can you?

1503
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:25,480
I've seen you acting really
well in school dramas.

1504
01:34:25,560 --> 01:34:26,680
Do try!

1505
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:29,360
Not easy uncle.

1506
01:34:30,200 --> 01:34:32,160
My dad is not talking to
me for this decision.

1507
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:35,480
He doesn't have confidence in me.

1508
01:34:35,960 --> 01:34:37,000
Well...

1509
01:34:37,480 --> 01:34:38,560
Let it go uncle.

1510
01:34:43,120 --> 01:34:44,240
Come with me.

1511
01:34:44,360 --> 01:34:45,280
Come!

1512
01:34:50,440 --> 01:34:51,680
Kallikulam

1513
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:53,800
That's where I was born.

1514
01:34:55,760 --> 01:34:58,240
It's a small village in
the Tirunelveli Zilla.

1515
01:35:01,160 --> 01:35:03,800
Growing up, I've never
seen a toilet Arjun.

1516
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:06,480
We always used to
do things outdoors.

1517
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:13,080
One fine day, my Mom went to use
the fields nearby to you know...

1518
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:18,000
She died of a snake bite.

1519
01:35:21,720 --> 01:35:22,880
What's the reason for this?

1520
01:35:24,120 --> 01:35:25,680
We didn't have a
toilet in our house.

1521
01:35:28,240 --> 01:35:30,280
If we had one, my mom
wouldn't have died right?

1522
01:35:32,640 --> 01:35:33,800
That's when I decided.

1523
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:37,520
No one else should suffer
like how I suffered.

1524
01:35:41,480 --> 01:35:44,000
When I said I want to build
free toilets in my village

1525
01:35:44,840 --> 01:35:47,320
everyone laughed
at me like I'm mad.

1526
01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:49,640
But that didn't bother me.

1527
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:52,640
I just got a train to
Chennai with a single bag.

1528
01:35:53,880 --> 01:35:56,280
I worked my ass off day and night.

1529
01:35:57,320 --> 01:35:59,520
That's the reason I own
this toiletry company now.

1530
01:36:02,640 --> 01:36:05,280
Today I own a bungalow, a car

1531
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:07,200
I've money in bank.

1532
01:36:08,160 --> 01:36:09,760
But the happiness is not in that.

1533
01:36:11,560 --> 01:36:13,040
From my own hard earned money

1534
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:14,640
in my village you see...

1535
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:20,320
I've built 420 free toilets.

1536
01:36:22,160 --> 01:36:23,840
The ones who laughed
at me the other day

1537
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:26,480
are spellbound now.

1538
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:32,040
If we prove our mettle
in front of others no?

1539
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:35,120
Then everyone will
start believing in us.

1540
01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:37,280
What should we do for that?

1541
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:40,200
Hard work is necessary.

1542
01:36:45,160 --> 01:36:46,320
But one thing...

1543
01:36:48,040 --> 01:36:50,600
I failed to take care
of my wife properly.

1544
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:54,200
She passed away.

1545
01:36:56,920 --> 01:36:59,400
The thought of my daughter
getting married

1546
01:37:02,360 --> 01:37:03,600
is scaring me.

1547
01:37:05,200 --> 01:37:06,880
If she'll be taken good care or not.

1548
01:37:11,080 --> 01:37:12,080
She'll be fine no?

1549
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:18,840
'I know Arjun from his childhood.'

1550
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,560
'I know he'll take
good care of my daughter.'

1551
01:37:21,680 --> 01:37:23,160
'What else do I want sir?'

1552
01:37:23,240 --> 01:37:24,560
'As if you guys
own an Apple company!'

1553
01:37:24,640 --> 01:37:26,160
'You're just making
toiletries right?'

1554
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:38,120
Okay, uncle!

1555
01:37:38,200 --> 01:37:39,240
I'll take leave.

1556
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:44,880
Give this to Anu uncle.

1557
01:37:56,600 --> 01:37:57,640
Sorry uncle!

1558
01:37:57,720 --> 01:37:58,800
For what?

1559
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:26,640
I'm sorry!

1560
01:38:45,040 --> 01:38:48,560
He spoke to my dad and felt very bad
that you're not talking to him uncle.

1561
01:38:49,720 --> 01:38:51,120
What else can I do?

1562
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:54,040
I'm afraid his life will be
spoiled if he gets into cinema.

1563
01:38:54,840 --> 01:38:56,680
If he's a small boy, I can make
him understand by a slap or two.

1564
01:38:56,840 --> 01:38:58,160
He's a grown up man now.

1565
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:00,880
I understand uncle.

1566
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:02,560
You're fear is understandable.

1567
01:39:03,440 --> 01:39:05,920
But I'm not telling this
to just support him.

1568
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:07,640
He's really talented uncle.

1569
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:10,520
Look at this.

1570
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:14,120
'Other than that in the
history of my prestigious life...'

1571
01:39:14,200 --> 01:39:16,000
'No place for other words'

1572
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:18,800
All these were shot when he
acted in college functions.

1573
01:39:21,560 --> 01:39:23,440
You can see for yourself
how many people are

1574
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:25,360
clapping and whistling
for his performance.

1575
01:39:30,840 --> 01:39:32,160
It's just one life uncle.

1576
01:39:32,440 --> 01:39:34,080
Let him do what he likes no?

1577
01:39:34,200 --> 01:39:35,960
I'm sure he will make
you proud one day.

1578
01:39:39,760 --> 01:39:40,960
Please uncle.

1579
01:39:41,040 --> 01:39:42,360
Talk to him no?

1580
01:39:42,640 --> 01:39:43,600
Please.

1581
01:39:51,440 --> 01:39:52,960
Be well dear.
- Thank you uncle.

1582
01:39:53,040 --> 01:39:54,960
That guy should be blessed
to have you as his wife.

1583
01:39:55,040 --> 01:39:56,280
Be well dear.

1584
01:39:56,640 --> 01:39:57,880
Thank you Mom!

1585
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:06,760
Even we have a dream of
getting him married.

1586
01:40:06,840 --> 01:40:09,320
If he gets into acting, who
do you think will marry him?

1587
01:40:09,640 --> 01:40:10,520
You tell me.

1588
01:40:10,600 --> 01:40:12,400
Will you marry such a guy?

1589
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:15,160
Of course I will Mom!

1590
01:40:15,240 --> 01:40:17,480
But I'll have a condition
that I'll divorce him

1591
01:40:17,560 --> 01:40:18,880
if he gets close to the heroines.

1592
01:40:19,560 --> 01:40:20,680
Whatever!

1593
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:33,560
Hey!

1594
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:35,840
Hey!

1595
01:40:41,880 --> 01:40:42,760
Sorry!

1596
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:50,920
I'm sorry too!

1597
01:40:57,880 --> 01:40:58,880
Noodle-Head!

1598
01:41:33,560 --> 01:41:34,720
Congrats!

1599
01:41:38,600 --> 01:41:41,040
I'm going to invite Mani,
you want to join?

1600
01:41:50,440 --> 01:41:51,360
Let's go.

1601
01:41:52,480 --> 01:41:54,040
Bye Mom!
- Hey!

1602
01:41:54,600 --> 01:41:56,080
You just have one year's time.

1603
01:42:02,360 --> 01:42:03,320
Thanks Dad!

1604
01:42:14,440 --> 01:42:16,600
Hey it's a good song dude,
why did you stop?

1605
01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:18,840
You don't like this song right?

1606
01:42:18,920 --> 01:42:20,560
I like all the A.R.Rahman songs.

1607
01:42:20,640 --> 01:42:21,680
Play it.

1608
01:42:23,760 --> 01:42:24,640
No!

1609
01:42:25,320 --> 01:42:27,040
It's been long since we spoke,
so let's talk.

1610
01:42:28,360 --> 01:42:29,240
Okay!

1611
01:42:31,200 --> 01:42:32,560
Hey, I forgot to ask you something.

1612
01:42:33,680 --> 01:42:34,960
I heard you're in love with Meera!

1613
01:42:38,920 --> 01:42:40,160
Did Mani tell you?

1614
01:42:41,240 --> 01:42:42,960
I know that since our childhood

1615
01:42:43,280 --> 01:42:44,800
that you have a crush on her.

1616
01:42:46,360 --> 01:42:47,560
Nothing like that.

1617
01:42:47,640 --> 01:42:49,640
Just now after I
got to know about her.

1618
01:42:51,040 --> 01:42:52,200
Did you ask her out?

1619
01:42:52,280 --> 01:42:53,280
Hey!

1620
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:55,240
I don't even know if she likes me.

1621
01:42:55,600 --> 01:42:56,840
How'll I ask her out?

1622
01:42:56,920 --> 01:42:58,960
Okay, call her now.
- For what?

1623
01:42:59,200 --> 01:43:00,480
Call her and say

1624
01:43:00,720 --> 01:43:03,480
we have a friend's bachelorette
party this weekend

1625
01:43:04,240 --> 01:43:05,280
and ask her if
she would join you.

1626
01:43:05,440 --> 01:43:06,280
Hey!

1627
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:09,040
Why would she come to
your bachelorette party?

1628
01:43:09,120 --> 01:43:10,040
Correct!

1629
01:43:10,840 --> 01:43:14,480
It's not even necessary that she
should come to a stranger's party.

1630
01:43:15,160 --> 01:43:18,600
But if she says she'll come
just because you invited her

1631
01:43:18,760 --> 01:43:20,720
then of course
she's interested in you.

1632
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:24,800
Hey! Noodle-Head!

1633
01:43:25,120 --> 01:43:26,200
Yes.

1634
01:43:27,400 --> 01:43:28,480
What?

1635
01:43:29,960 --> 01:43:32,000
Call her.
- Yes!

1636
01:43:40,400 --> 01:43:41,760
Line's busy.

1637
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:43,640
Okay leave it.

1638
01:43:44,040 --> 01:43:45,760
But let her call back, okay?

1639
01:43:48,120 --> 01:43:50,000
What non sense are you talking?
I'll thrash your face.

1640
01:43:50,080 --> 01:43:52,000
Oh, so you think my
parents got me married

1641
01:43:52,080 --> 01:43:53,640
to you so that you
can thrash my face?

1642
01:43:53,720 --> 01:43:55,520
I dare you touch me,
I'll divorce you and go away.

1643
01:43:55,600 --> 01:43:56,840
Are you trying to scare
me with a broomstick?

1644
01:43:56,920 --> 01:43:59,640
Who the hell are you to divorce me?
I'll divorce you, get out now.

1645
01:44:00,840 --> 01:44:02,200
Hey! Why are you going inside?

1646
01:44:02,280 --> 01:44:03,640
Your father's house is this way out.

1647
01:44:03,720 --> 01:44:04,600
Hey Mani!

1648
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:06,080
Hey!

1649
01:44:06,680 --> 01:44:08,120
You both got back together?

1650
01:44:08,840 --> 01:44:09,800
Super!

1651
01:44:10,360 --> 01:44:11,320
Hey Swathi!
- What?

1652
01:44:11,400 --> 01:44:12,880
Friends have come, come outside.

1653
01:44:14,840 --> 01:44:15,880
Welcome.

1654
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:18,320
What's this divorce talk and all?

1655
01:44:19,040 --> 01:44:20,000
That's wrong Mani.

1656
01:44:20,080 --> 01:44:22,360
Dude! You keep baby-ing her
when you guys come outside?

1657
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:23,840
And you keep fighting
like this here?

1658
01:44:23,920 --> 01:44:25,360
Can you please stop your advises?

1659
01:44:25,520 --> 01:44:26,800
Who's not fighting at home?

1660
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:28,680
You guys don't even know
what we're fighting for! - As if...!

1661
01:44:28,760 --> 01:44:31,200
I told her, we need to have a
baby to get a closure to the family.

1662
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:32,440
She says 'NO'.

1663
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:34,120
Why Swathi?

1664
01:44:34,240 --> 01:44:37,040
If we have a baby, the time I spend
with him will become very less.

1665
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:38,199
So...!

1666
01:44:38,680 --> 01:44:40,160
Any which ways, both the reasons
are love based right?

1667
01:44:42,520 --> 01:44:43,520
She's my love dude!

1668
01:44:44,520 --> 01:44:45,520
I won't just leave her.

1669
01:44:45,600 --> 01:44:46,520
Baby?

1670
01:45:06,280 --> 01:45:07,960
Imagine how he was during college?

1671
01:45:09,040 --> 01:45:10,160
And look at him now.

1672
01:45:10,480 --> 01:45:11,920
He's so matured right?

1673
01:45:13,240 --> 01:45:16,880
We can never predict how people
will change after marriage right?

1674
01:45:25,480 --> 01:45:26,574
Meera, Meera!

1675
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:27,960
Answer now, answer now.
- No!

1676
01:45:28,560 --> 01:45:30,360
Hello!
- Meera!

1677
01:45:30,480 --> 01:45:31,360
Yes, Arjun!

1678
01:45:31,440 --> 01:45:32,800
What to tell?
- Ask her no?

1679
01:45:35,080 --> 01:45:37,000
What's up?
- This weekend...

1680
01:45:37,080 --> 01:45:38,720
We have our friend's
bachelorette party!

1681
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:39,920
Okay!

1682
01:45:41,520 --> 01:45:42,535
Will you join me?

1683
01:45:44,440 --> 01:45:45,424
Sure, I will come.

1684
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:46,973
Yes!

1685
01:47:15,080 --> 01:47:16,920
I'll just go get the car and come.
- Yeah!

1686
01:47:17,280 --> 01:47:18,720
Hey Mani? You told I look mediocre?

1687
01:47:18,800 --> 01:47:19,719
Hey!

1688
01:47:21,320 --> 01:47:22,760
You should definitely come
for our wedding.

1689
01:47:24,920 --> 01:47:26,320
March 10th?
- Yes!

1690
01:47:27,120 --> 01:47:28,120
My birthday!

1691
01:47:28,200 --> 01:47:30,120
Oh, what a coincidence.

1692
01:47:32,040 --> 01:47:34,000
So then... You're done
with the wedding shopping?

1693
01:47:34,080 --> 01:47:35,160
No, yet to start.

1694
01:47:36,680 --> 01:47:38,000
Listen, you have to come okay?

1695
01:47:38,480 --> 01:47:39,720
I'll definitely come.

1696
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,040
Hey, Meera!
Cab has arrived.

1697
01:47:42,640 --> 01:47:44,400
Nice meeting you.
- All the best, Bye!

1698
01:47:44,520 --> 01:47:45,920
You just have 25 days remaining
for the wedding,

1699
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:47,400
get done with the shopping soon.
- Yeah!

1700
01:47:47,480 --> 01:47:49,480
Okay, I'll take leave.
- Hey, I'll take care, you be here.

1701
01:47:49,560 --> 01:47:51,360
Are you sure?
- Yes, I'll manage bye!

1702
01:47:51,440 --> 01:47:52,442
Okay!

1703
01:47:53,320 --> 01:47:54,520
Bye!
- Bye!

1704
01:48:06,240 --> 01:48:07,920
I'm sure she likes you.

1705
01:48:09,640 --> 01:48:12,320
Plan something big and propose
her on her birthday!

1706
01:48:14,240 --> 01:48:15,400
What shall I do?

1707
01:48:16,800 --> 01:48:18,400
You want an idea effortlessly?

1708
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:21,600
You help me out with
the wedding shopping.

1709
01:48:22,040 --> 01:48:23,200
I'll give you idea.

1710
01:48:24,520 --> 01:48:25,480
Deal?

1711
01:48:32,480 --> 01:48:33,640
Birthday video.

1712
01:48:35,720 --> 01:48:36,800
Birthday Video!

1713
01:48:37,440 --> 01:48:38,600
Birthday video?

1714
01:48:40,640 --> 01:48:43,840
She will have few favourite people
from childhood no?

1715
01:48:44,200 --> 01:48:45,760
Meet everyone of them and

1716
01:48:46,520 --> 01:48:48,600
make a birthday video
and gift it to her.

1717
01:48:50,880 --> 01:48:52,560
How can this become a proposal?

1718
01:48:52,920 --> 01:48:55,360
At the end of the video, you also
wish her and propose her.

1719
01:49:00,720 --> 01:49:03,080
Hey! Try this one, it'll look good.

1720
01:49:10,480 --> 01:49:11,800
The idea is good.

1721
01:49:12,600 --> 01:49:13,560
But...

1722
01:49:17,040 --> 01:49:18,000
But?

1723
01:49:19,080 --> 01:49:21,440
Hey! I know very little about her.

1724
01:49:21,520 --> 01:49:23,640
How'll I search for
her favorite people?

1725
01:49:24,520 --> 01:49:26,440
Do you know any of her friends?

1726
01:49:33,200 --> 01:49:34,720
You know heels won't fit you right?

1727
01:49:34,880 --> 01:49:36,000
Then why do you want to try this?

1728
01:49:37,680 --> 01:49:39,280
You're going to slip and fall down
on the day of your wedding.

1729
01:49:39,560 --> 01:49:40,440
Be careful.

1730
01:49:56,040 --> 01:49:58,320
Most of the people in the list
given by Priya are in Kerala dude.

1731
01:49:58,400 --> 01:50:01,560
Call everyone and ask them when
they'll be free and start to Kerala.

1732
01:50:03,040 --> 01:50:04,440
Why should I unnecessarily go there?

1733
01:50:04,680 --> 01:50:06,000
Isn't it better if...

1734
01:50:06,320 --> 01:50:08,360
If I ask them to record it and
send it to me?

1735
01:50:09,040 --> 01:50:09,960
Unnecessarily?

1736
01:50:10,160 --> 01:50:12,040
Yes!
- Hey!

1737
01:50:12,240 --> 01:50:15,880
More than the gift you give her
its efforts that will impress her.

1738
01:50:20,960 --> 01:50:23,120
Oh by the way, how do you
know all these things?

1739
01:50:24,480 --> 01:50:25,480
I'm a girl dude.

1740
01:50:34,400 --> 01:50:35,320
Arjun!

1741
01:50:42,720 --> 01:50:43,920
How's it?

1742
01:50:44,440 --> 01:50:45,640
It's beautiful!

1743
01:50:58,560 --> 01:51:00,240
Dude!
- 'Tell me!'

1744
01:51:00,320 --> 01:51:02,200
I'm planning to make a video
and propose on Meera's b'day.

1745
01:51:02,280 --> 01:51:04,560
'Do it. Who asked you not to?'

1746
01:51:05,720 --> 01:51:07,360
Need to go to Kerala or a
couple of days. Come with me.

1747
01:51:08,120 --> 01:51:09,920
'No chance. My in-laws are home.'

1748
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:11,520
'You go and come.'
- Okay, hang up!

1749
01:51:14,880 --> 01:51:16,040
Shall I come with you?

1750
01:51:17,360 --> 01:51:18,480
Don't be kidding Anu!

1751
01:51:18,560 --> 01:51:20,040
Your wedding is in a week.

1752
01:51:20,520 --> 01:51:22,320
It's just two days right?
I'll manage.

1753
01:51:24,680 --> 01:51:27,480
Like Mani said, after marriage,
life will change Arjun.

1754
01:51:28,080 --> 01:51:29,640
It'll be hard to meet even rarely.

1755
01:51:30,680 --> 01:51:32,200
Let's forget this wedding thing...

1756
01:51:32,480 --> 01:51:33,960
and just like school college days

1757
01:51:34,240 --> 01:51:35,560
I want to spend time with you.

1758
01:51:38,560 --> 01:51:39,720
Please Arjun!

1759
01:51:42,880 --> 01:51:46,280
During college final year
remember you asked for a bike trip?

1760
01:51:48,800 --> 01:51:49,840
Let's do that?

1761
01:51:50,760 --> 01:51:51,880
Seriously?

1762
01:51:52,680 --> 01:51:54,120
Seriously?
- Yeah!

1763
01:51:54,200 --> 01:51:55,680
Okay, let's go.

1764
01:54:33,080 --> 01:54:34,720
Looks like it'll rain Arjun!

1765
01:54:35,120 --> 01:54:37,320
Just halt in whichever hotel
that comes next.

1766
01:54:38,120 --> 01:54:39,080
Okay!

1767
01:54:47,920 --> 01:54:49,200
This place looks a little off to me.

1768
01:54:49,720 --> 01:54:50,840
I'm very tired.

1769
01:54:51,320 --> 01:54:52,320
It's okay.

1770
01:54:52,960 --> 01:54:54,080
Just one night right?

1771
01:54:54,360 --> 01:54:55,440
We'll manage.

1772
01:55:01,520 --> 01:55:02,920
I think it's the last room.

1773
01:55:27,520 --> 01:55:28,840
What are you doing?

1774
01:55:30,800 --> 01:55:32,560
Well, I'll sleep on the floor.

1775
01:55:49,280 --> 01:55:51,080
Noodle-Head, my friend.

1776
01:55:51,480 --> 01:55:52,560
Hey!

1777
01:55:56,440 --> 01:55:57,760
Arjun please Arjun please

1778
01:55:57,840 --> 01:55:58,880
Go to hell!

1779
01:56:04,720 --> 01:56:05,760
What?

1780
01:56:06,040 --> 01:56:07,040
Noting.

1781
01:56:09,680 --> 01:56:11,760
Sleep now, we need to
wakeup early.

1782
01:56:25,880 --> 01:56:27,400
What's the cost of this item?

1783
01:56:27,480 --> 01:56:28,440
I don't get it.

1784
01:56:28,520 --> 01:56:30,160
I mean, how much does
she charge per night?

1785
01:56:31,160 --> 01:56:32,560
Don't hit me.

1786
01:56:34,360 --> 01:56:35,680
She's my wife.

1787
01:56:35,760 --> 01:56:38,360
Sorry brother, sorry I didn't know.

1788
01:57:31,480 --> 01:57:33,240
This view is so romantic no?

1789
01:57:42,960 --> 01:57:43,840
Propose now.

1790
01:57:44,160 --> 01:57:45,200
I love you Anu!

1791
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:51,320
You got the name wrong dude.

1792
01:57:54,200 --> 01:57:55,320
Sorry!

1793
01:57:58,680 --> 01:58:00,080
Okay, get it right this time.

1794
01:58:01,200 --> 01:58:02,153
Anu!

1795
01:58:03,038 --> 01:58:04,880
Not now.
I don't feel like it.

1796
01:58:04,960 --> 01:58:06,440
I'll do it later when I'm alone.

1797
01:58:09,280 --> 01:58:11,080
So you want to feel it alone!

1798
01:58:28,440 --> 01:58:29,400
Bye!

1799
01:58:33,440 --> 01:58:34,360
One second!

1800
01:58:36,200 --> 01:58:38,080
Would you mind getting
wishes from my brother also?

1801
01:58:38,160 --> 01:58:39,400
What's your brother's name?

1802
01:58:39,480 --> 01:58:40,440
Krishna!

1803
01:58:40,600 --> 01:58:43,200
Krishna's name is...not on the list.

1804
01:58:44,880 --> 01:58:47,000
Meera and my brother
were dating each other.

1805
01:58:47,320 --> 01:58:50,840
Later they broke up, so Shruthi
would've forgot to tell you.

1806
01:58:52,080 --> 01:58:55,040
But Meera will be really happy
to see my brother in the video.

1807
01:58:55,920 --> 01:58:56,880
Why should we bring in old...

1808
01:58:56,960 --> 01:58:57,840
Where will your brother be?

1809
01:58:59,080 --> 01:59:00,440
He's gone to the boxing club.

1810
01:59:00,840 --> 01:59:03,600
Just give me two minutes,
I'll take you there.

1811
01:59:05,360 --> 01:59:06,720
'Then come let's
prepare it together.'

1812
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:08,720
'Hey! This is my story.'

1813
01:59:10,200 --> 01:59:11,120
Priya!

1814
01:59:14,600 --> 01:59:15,760
Krishna...

1815
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:17,120
Is he a boxer?

1816
01:59:17,800 --> 01:59:19,480
Boxing is his everything.

1817
01:59:27,080 --> 01:59:28,280
Krishna!

1818
01:59:38,960 --> 01:59:41,320
'This is just like
a part time job for me.'

1819
01:59:42,720 --> 01:59:44,400
'My dream is totally
something else.'

1820
01:59:47,840 --> 01:59:50,240
Why are you so excited
to meet her ex?

1821
01:59:52,080 --> 01:59:53,680
Hey, you won't get it dude.

1822
01:59:54,800 --> 01:59:55,760
Brother!

1823
01:59:55,840 --> 01:59:56,960
How have you been?

1824
01:59:57,040 --> 01:59:58,000
I swear I didn't expect
to see you here.

1825
01:59:58,080 --> 01:59:59,200
Priya!
- Who are they?

1826
01:59:59,280 --> 02:00:00,440
They're Meera's friends,

1827
02:00:00,520 --> 02:00:04,160
they've come from Chennai
to record a video for her birthday.

1828
02:00:11,760 --> 02:00:12,720
Brother!

1829
02:00:13,880 --> 02:00:15,480
I've already hurt her so much.

1830
02:00:17,160 --> 02:00:18,800
If she sees me again in the video

1831
02:00:19,560 --> 02:00:20,760
it'll hurt her more.

1832
02:00:22,760 --> 02:00:23,840
So, let's not do this.

1833
02:00:24,280 --> 02:00:25,280
Please.

1834
02:00:32,680 --> 02:00:33,840
'Now I'm afraid.'

1835
02:00:34,280 --> 02:00:38,080
'I'm afraid I won't be able to live
with you if something happens.'

1836
02:00:39,040 --> 02:00:42,160
'That fear is making me lose even
before I enter the ring.'

1837
02:00:42,720 --> 02:00:43,680
Brother!

1838
02:00:49,840 --> 02:00:51,280
You haven't moved on right?

1839
02:01:06,920 --> 02:01:08,560
Sorry.

1840
02:01:09,800 --> 02:01:11,840
How do you know he's
still not moved on?

1841
02:01:17,200 --> 02:01:18,400
I'm a boy Anu.

1842
02:01:22,880 --> 02:01:25,040
Everyone will have a past
in their life Arjun!

1843
02:01:25,840 --> 02:01:28,080
You don't think about anything
and just propose to Meera!

1844
02:01:28,429 --> 02:01:29,400
She'll definitely accept.

1845
02:01:29,480 --> 02:01:31,160
You look beautiful with
your curly hair Anu!

1846
02:01:34,240 --> 02:01:36,440
Why are you talking something
out of context?

1847
02:01:38,520 --> 02:01:40,440
I felt it so I said it.

1848
02:01:42,040 --> 02:01:45,000
All these years you've been
teasing me Noodle-Head!

1849
02:01:45,360 --> 02:01:46,640
What's with you now?

1850
02:01:48,640 --> 02:01:50,520
I understand everything in
life very late.

1851
02:01:50,960 --> 02:01:51,960
That's why!

1852
02:02:58,520 --> 02:02:59,960
Thanks for the trip Arjun!

1853
02:03:00,520 --> 02:03:02,560
I'll never forget these two
days in my life.

1854
02:03:15,560 --> 02:03:16,960
All the best for your love.

1855
02:03:21,400 --> 02:03:22,520
Anu!

1856
02:03:26,120 --> 02:03:28,840
'Without being in love or
having an understanding'

1857
02:03:28,920 --> 02:03:31,400
'being in this
marriage is pointless.'

1858
02:03:32,040 --> 02:03:35,200
'We can instead get divorced
for God's sake and live peacefully.'

1859
02:03:35,280 --> 02:03:36,440
'So you don't...'

1860
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:38,600
'So you don't love me at all?'

1861
02:03:45,800 --> 02:03:47,080
All the best for your wedding!

1862
02:04:14,840 --> 02:04:16,360
'You will come back at 4 PM to
sign the divorce right?'

1863
02:04:16,440 --> 02:04:18,520
'Divorce? Divorce?'

1864
02:05:30,880 --> 02:05:32,240
You go dad, I'll be here.
- Okay!

1865
02:05:32,880 --> 02:05:34,000
You come with me.

1866
02:05:35,560 --> 02:05:36,720
Hey! Hi.
- Hi!

1867
02:05:43,640 --> 02:05:44,560
What's up dude?

1868
02:05:45,040 --> 02:05:46,680
You gave the birthday
video to Meera?

1869
02:05:52,400 --> 02:05:54,520
After watching it, she must've
hugged and kissed you!

1870
02:06:02,920 --> 02:06:04,600
'Hey Meera! Happy b'day!'

1871
02:06:04,680 --> 02:06:05,640
'Happy b'day Meera!'

1872
02:06:05,720 --> 02:06:07,200
'How long to see you'

1873
02:06:08,200 --> 02:06:11,040
'Happy birthday my dear!'

1874
02:06:14,800 --> 02:06:17,720
'Many more happy returns of the day.'

1875
02:06:21,800 --> 02:06:22,960
'You're happy right?'

1876
02:06:24,200 --> 02:06:25,400
'Happy b'day Meera!'

1877
02:06:27,600 --> 02:06:28,720
'You've one more surprise!'

1878
02:06:29,240 --> 02:06:30,640
'Just look that side.'

1879
02:06:57,800 --> 02:06:59,080
Sorry!

1880
02:07:08,840 --> 02:07:09,960
Arjun?

1881
02:07:15,920 --> 02:07:17,000
Thanks!

1882
02:07:27,840 --> 02:07:28,920
You...

1883
02:07:29,120 --> 02:07:30,040
Mani?

1884
02:07:34,280 --> 02:07:36,280
You think you're Vijay
from 'Poove Unakkaga'?

1885
02:07:39,160 --> 02:07:40,160
Then why did you...

1886
02:07:43,440 --> 02:07:44,840
Why did you set them both up?

1887
02:07:53,160 --> 02:07:54,160
Swear to me!

1888
02:07:54,760 --> 02:07:56,880
Don't you feel bad looking
at a girl you love with another guy?

1889
02:08:10,720 --> 02:08:11,800
It did feel bad dude!

1890
02:08:14,200 --> 02:08:16,360
When I saw Anu with Matthew
in their engagement!

1891
02:08:18,240 --> 02:08:19,960
When Matthew kissed Anu!

1892
02:08:22,520 --> 02:08:23,600
It killed me dude!

1893
02:08:24,120 --> 02:08:25,040
Hey!

1894
02:08:25,120 --> 02:08:26,400
Are you in love with Anu?

1895
02:08:36,600 --> 02:08:37,680
Dude!

1896
02:08:38,160 --> 02:08:40,280
Dude, I'm not able to be here.

1897
02:08:40,360 --> 02:08:41,320
I'll be out.

1898
02:08:41,640 --> 02:08:42,840
Hey Arjun!

1899
02:08:43,200 --> 02:08:44,080
Arjun?

1900
02:08:47,040 --> 02:08:48,040
Hey dude!

1901
02:08:56,440 --> 02:08:57,326
Hey!

1902
02:08:57,760 --> 02:08:59,200
Does Anu know that you're
in love with her?

1903
02:09:01,600 --> 02:09:02,560
Why didn't you tell her?

1904
02:09:05,120 --> 02:09:06,600
You won't get it dude!

1905
02:09:06,920 --> 02:09:07,840
Damn it...

1906
02:09:15,800 --> 02:09:17,200
If you had said "Yes"
when she asked you out,

1907
02:09:17,280 --> 02:09:18,440
you wouldn't be sitting here now.

1908
02:09:21,960 --> 02:09:23,080
What could you have done!

1909
02:09:23,680 --> 02:09:25,360
God has miscalculated your fate.

1910
02:09:30,760 --> 02:09:32,360
Why are you laughing
like a mad person now?

1911
02:09:35,120 --> 02:09:36,720
You won't get that too dude!

1912
02:09:36,840 --> 02:09:37,800
Damn it!

1913
02:09:42,200 --> 02:09:44,440
You'll never know the value of
something when it's with you right?

1914
02:09:45,320 --> 02:09:46,720
You'll know only after
you lose it, huh?

1915
02:09:52,440 --> 02:09:53,399
Okay, come!

1916
02:09:54,680 --> 02:09:56,960
Come, let's talk something to
her and stop the wedding.

1917
02:09:57,040 --> 02:09:58,040
Hey!

1918
02:09:58,440 --> 02:09:59,880
Don't behave like a cinema friend.

1919
02:10:00,040 --> 02:10:01,440
Will you come now, or shall I go?

1920
02:10:03,520 --> 02:10:04,400
Hey!

1921
02:10:04,840 --> 02:10:06,840
You think she'll throw off everything
and come if you go and call?

1922
02:10:08,400 --> 02:10:09,720
Anu is a practical girl dude!

1923
02:10:10,320 --> 02:10:11,250
She won't come.

1924
02:10:11,720 --> 02:10:12,960
You idiot!

1925
02:10:16,400 --> 02:10:17,320
Hey!

1926
02:10:24,480 --> 02:10:25,560
Auto!

1927
02:10:37,800 --> 02:10:39,960
Anu!
- Hey dude, come on!

1928
02:11:03,800 --> 02:11:05,400
Boopathi, 2 tequila shots please!

1929
02:11:15,080 --> 02:11:16,120
Hey crackpot!

1930
02:11:16,520 --> 02:11:18,520
You ran away from your wedding
to have a drink?

1931
02:11:27,080 --> 02:11:28,840
3 more shots please!

1932
02:11:31,280 --> 02:11:32,240
What happened Anu?

1933
02:11:33,720 --> 02:11:36,000
I don't like getting married Arjun!
- You don't like?

1934
02:11:36,080 --> 02:11:37,200
Then why did you accept
to get married?

1935
02:11:37,280 --> 02:11:38,720
Why didn't you propose to Meera?

1936
02:11:41,320 --> 02:11:43,320
She's asking you!
Answer her, sir!

1937
02:11:46,440 --> 02:11:48,480
I felt I didn't have any
Love on her. So...!

1938
02:11:48,720 --> 02:11:50,320
He's lying Anu,
He's in love with you...

1939
02:11:51,520 --> 02:11:52,840
Shut up!

1940
02:11:54,560 --> 02:11:55,880
I know Arjun!

1941
02:12:03,680 --> 02:12:04,680
Hey!

1942
02:12:05,480 --> 02:12:06,520
Careful!

1943
02:12:24,720 --> 02:12:25,760
'I love you Anu!'

1944
02:12:27,840 --> 02:12:29,560
'I understand everything
in life very late.'

1945
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:32,400
'All the best for your wedding.'

1946
02:12:34,360 --> 02:12:36,040
'I felt you were in love with me.'

1947
02:12:36,120 --> 02:12:40,560
Will you take Matthew as your
husband and marry him?

1948
02:12:40,720 --> 02:12:45,120
'If I say "No" now, I know how
many people it'll affect.'

1949
02:12:47,440 --> 02:12:51,040
'But you felt very bad and left
out of the church no?'

1950
02:12:54,560 --> 02:12:57,360
'That's why I threw
off everything and came.'

1951
02:13:10,640 --> 02:13:13,040
'You seemed lonely standing here.
That's why I came.'

1952
02:13:13,840 --> 02:13:15,120
'Nothing like that.'

1953
02:13:16,600 --> 02:13:18,160
'You think I can't figure out
looking at your face?'

1954
02:13:20,560 --> 02:13:22,200
Whatever you did is
pure madness.

1955
02:13:22,640 --> 02:13:23,560
I know!

1956
02:13:24,040 --> 02:13:26,440
But... You can't look out
for logic in love.

1957
02:13:27,160 --> 02:13:28,760
It's a magic!
You told me these words.

1958
02:13:28,840 --> 02:13:30,680
Hey! Come on come on come on!

1959
02:13:31,880 --> 02:13:32,800
Talk now!

1960
02:13:35,080 --> 02:13:35,988
Anu!

1961
02:13:36,360 --> 02:13:37,560
You are too good a girl Anu!

1962
02:13:41,320 --> 02:13:42,440
But I don't deserve you!

1963
02:13:46,840 --> 02:13:48,160
Matthew is a nice guy!

1964
02:13:48,520 --> 02:13:49,680
He'll be your right match!

1965
02:13:50,720 --> 02:13:51,640
You're right!

1966
02:13:54,880 --> 02:13:55,920
But he's not you.

1967
02:14:02,440 --> 02:14:04,320
I'll be happy only if I'm with you.

1968
02:14:08,344 --> 02:14:09,306
Nope!

1969
02:14:09,680 --> 02:14:10,720
You'll go through hell!

1970
02:14:10,946 --> 02:14:11,960
Hey!

1971
02:14:12,040 --> 02:14:13,720
Hell or heaven, you'll
know only if you live.

1972
02:14:13,800 --> 02:14:15,400
How can you tell that
without living?

1973
02:14:15,920 --> 02:14:16,880
Dude!

1974
02:14:16,960 --> 02:14:17,920
You won't get it dude!

1975
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:19,040
He's started it again.

1976
02:14:21,240 --> 02:14:24,080
Hey! Why the hell do you keep
saying the same thing?

1977
02:14:24,160 --> 02:14:26,480
First tell me what it is.
I'll tell you if I get it or not!

1978
02:14:29,560 --> 02:14:30,560
Tell me Arjun!

1979
02:14:30,880 --> 02:14:32,720
No Anu!
- Hey tell me now!

1980
02:14:36,360 --> 02:14:38,640
You tell, you die.

1981
02:14:40,240 --> 02:14:43,600
I've already married you, dragged
you till divorce and hurt you.

1982
02:14:43,680 --> 02:14:44,680
You get it?

1983
02:14:45,200 --> 02:14:46,360
Do you get it?

1984
02:14:46,440 --> 02:14:48,280
You're going to die.

1985
02:14:56,560 --> 02:14:57,720
Arjun, what are you doing?

1986
02:14:57,920 --> 02:14:58,920
Arjun!

1987
02:14:59,400 --> 02:15:00,280
Arjun!

1988
02:15:28,640 --> 02:15:30,680
Arjun! Lorry!

1989
02:15:36,360 --> 02:15:37,960
Your chances have been extinguished.

1990
02:15:38,520 --> 02:15:39,419
That's it.

1991
02:15:39,640 --> 02:15:41,040
You died in that life.

1992
02:15:41,840 --> 02:15:43,560
Sir! Sir Sir!

1993
02:15:43,880 --> 02:15:44,821
Arjun!

1994
02:15:45,040 --> 02:15:46,880
Not honoring the condition
was your mistake.

1995
02:15:47,080 --> 02:15:49,400
But still we will forgive you and
send you back to your old life.

1996
02:15:49,480 --> 02:15:50,720
Don't stand here and keep talking.

1997
02:15:50,800 --> 02:15:51,960
Go, go, go to your court.

1998
02:15:52,120 --> 02:15:53,640
Your watch doesn't have time right?

1999
02:15:54,160 --> 02:15:55,160
If I go the court...

2000
02:15:55,880 --> 02:15:57,360
and...if Anu gives divorce...

2001
02:15:58,720 --> 02:16:00,880
Give me one more chance sir,
restart my life again sir.

2002
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:03,080
This time I'll say "Yes" and be
happy with her sir.

2003
02:16:03,240 --> 02:16:04,267
Please sir.

2004
02:16:05,040 --> 02:16:07,200
The one who faces his own
problem is a Hero.

2005
02:16:07,720 --> 02:16:09,280
How about you? Hero right?

2006
02:16:12,200 --> 02:16:13,240
Go!

2007
02:16:13,320 --> 02:16:14,720
Go to the court and meet your Anu.

2008
02:16:16,200 --> 02:16:17,120
Sir!

2009
02:16:17,360 --> 02:16:19,600
I'm scared to even face her sir.

2010
02:16:22,200 --> 02:16:24,400
All she expected
from you is just Love.

2011
02:16:24,840 --> 02:16:25,720
Go!

2012
02:16:27,400 --> 02:16:29,120
Fall at your wife's feet!

2013
02:16:32,760 --> 02:16:33,840
So much drama!

2014
02:16:33,920 --> 02:16:35,400
I pity these humans!

2015
02:16:38,720 --> 02:16:39,684
Sir!

2016
02:16:39,920 --> 02:16:41,240
Can I hug you just once?

2017
02:16:56,920 --> 02:16:57,880
Be well!

2018
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:16,000
I'm very tired.

2019
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:19,160
Can we go on a holiday trip?

2020
02:17:19,240 --> 02:17:20,255
Sir!

2021
02:17:20,560 --> 02:17:22,360
We've a lot of pending cases.

2022
02:17:22,520 --> 02:17:24,560
We need to finish our job.
Just stay here.

2023
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:27,080
Oh my God!

2024
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:13,480
Hey dude!
Don't do this.

2025
02:18:13,560 --> 02:18:15,120
Listen to me, don't be impulsive.

2026
02:18:43,240 --> 02:18:44,280
Anu.
- Come sir.

2027
02:18:44,480 --> 02:18:45,800
Judge Ma'am will become furious.

2028
02:18:45,880 --> 02:18:47,480
Come, come and stand here.

2029
02:18:50,080 --> 02:18:52,440
You fainted in the morning,
how're you?

2030
02:18:52,520 --> 02:18:53,880
It's all stress Madam.

2031
02:18:53,960 --> 02:18:55,080
Nothing else.

2032
02:18:57,800 --> 02:19:00,120
Do we have your consent
in this divorce?

2033
02:19:01,360 --> 02:19:02,800
Yes, you have my consent.
- Okay!

2034
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:04,000
Madam!

2035
02:19:04,520 --> 02:19:05,840
I don't want this divorce Madam.

2036
02:19:10,480 --> 02:19:11,840
Are you kidding me?

2037
02:19:12,160 --> 02:19:14,800
You said you wanted it in the
morning, now you don't want it?

2038
02:19:15,920 --> 02:19:18,440
Do you know how many
divorce cases are in pending?

2039
02:19:18,520 --> 02:19:20,880
What do you think of yourself?

2040
02:19:23,880 --> 02:19:26,000
I'm talking to you, look at me.

2041
02:19:26,560 --> 02:19:27,480
It's my bad Madam.

2042
02:19:29,560 --> 02:19:31,400
Asking for divorce was my
impulsive decision.

2043
02:19:31,840 --> 02:19:32,720
Not her.

2044
02:19:34,480 --> 02:19:35,800
She likes me a lot Madam!

2045
02:19:38,440 --> 02:19:39,680
She'll do anything for me.

2046
02:19:41,880 --> 02:19:42,840
Why?

2047
02:19:42,920 --> 02:19:44,800
She'll even throw off everything
and come for me.

2048
02:19:48,320 --> 02:19:49,840
Girls like her!

2049
02:19:51,240 --> 02:19:52,680
No one can get Madam!

2050
02:19:54,960 --> 02:19:57,440
I didn't understand her
value and lost her.

2051
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:01,760
Don't ask me what happened
and why it happened!

2052
02:20:05,280 --> 02:20:06,600
I understood today!

2053
02:20:08,280 --> 02:20:09,800
This Noodle-Head standing here...

2054
02:20:10,800 --> 02:20:14,000
She's my friend, figure, lover,
wife and everything.

2055
02:20:20,640 --> 02:20:21,560
I know Madam!

2056
02:20:23,800 --> 02:20:25,280
I know she's angry on me.

2057
02:20:28,800 --> 02:20:30,120
But definitely one day...

2058
02:20:31,120 --> 02:20:33,280
I'll make sure she understands
how much I love her.

2059
02:20:34,200 --> 02:20:35,920
Ask her to give me just one
chance Madam!

2060
02:20:36,360 --> 02:20:37,342
Just one chance.

2061
02:20:37,560 --> 02:20:38,480
Please Madam!

2062
02:20:39,360 --> 02:20:41,400
You've said everything no?

2063
02:20:43,200 --> 02:20:44,111
What now?

2064
02:20:44,720 --> 02:20:46,520
Can we give him one more chance?

2065
02:20:46,600 --> 02:20:48,000
Why do we have to give
him chance and all?

2066
02:20:48,080 --> 02:20:48,960
Just cut them off Madam!

2067
02:20:49,040 --> 02:20:50,840
There seems to be no reaction.

2068
02:20:52,960 --> 02:20:54,920
Doesn't look like she's
gained trust on you.

2069
02:20:55,680 --> 02:20:56,560
Madam!

2070
02:20:57,240 --> 02:20:58,200
You never know.

2071
02:20:58,920 --> 02:21:00,880
She'll find out by just
seeing this face Madam.

2072
02:21:01,440 --> 02:21:02,720
If I'm lying or speaking the truth.

2073
02:21:04,240 --> 02:21:05,120
What a slap!

2074
02:21:13,400 --> 02:21:14,760
Will you call Meera as Akka?

2075
02:21:17,080 --> 02:21:18,280
Meera Akka!

2076
02:21:23,920 --> 02:21:25,880
Will you promise me that
you won't move close

2077
02:21:25,960 --> 02:21:27,320
with the heroines you
act within cinema?

2078
02:21:28,040 --> 02:21:30,080
Just like TR, I'll act
without touching them.

2079
02:21:36,360 --> 02:21:37,800
Do you really love me?

2080
02:21:42,960 --> 02:21:44,560
You're not blabbering because
you're high right?

2081
02:21:52,520 --> 02:21:53,720
Go home and do these things.

2082
02:21:53,800 --> 02:21:55,120
What a stupid case this is.

2083
02:21:55,200 --> 02:21:56,640
Case is dismissed.

2084
02:22:36,880 --> 02:22:37,880
Lord Vinayaka!

2085
02:22:38,200 --> 02:22:40,320
My friends are going
to get divorced.

2086
02:22:40,760 --> 02:22:42,520
He's a crackpot!
But a nice guy!

2087
02:22:42,760 --> 02:22:43,880
I don't know what to do.

2088
02:22:43,960 --> 02:22:45,240
Somehow please stop them
from getting divorced.

2089
02:22:45,320 --> 02:22:46,960
I'll break you 1000 coconuts.
- Dude!

2090
02:22:52,120 --> 02:22:53,200
Oh my God!

2091
02:22:53,280 --> 02:22:54,480
She fainted again?

2092
02:22:54,920 --> 02:22:55,800
Hey!

2093
02:22:56,680 --> 02:22:58,360
We're back together.
- Back together?

2094
02:22:59,640 --> 02:23:00,920
As in back together?

2095
02:23:02,280 --> 02:23:03,160
But

2096
02:23:03,800 --> 02:23:05,240
it was different in the morning

2097
02:23:05,800 --> 02:23:06,720
now it's like this.

2098
02:23:08,240 --> 02:23:09,224
How dude?

2099
02:23:09,520 --> 02:23:10,471
Well!

2100
02:23:11,200 --> 02:23:12,680
You won't get it dude!

2101
02:23:16,240 --> 02:23:17,480
Condition number 2.

2102
02:23:17,640 --> 02:23:21,120
You should never utter a word
about this second chance to anyone.

2103
02:23:21,440 --> 02:23:22,560
Condition number 3.

2104
02:23:22,640 --> 02:23:24,800
If you say nothing will happen.

2105
02:23:25,640 --> 02:23:26,720
Take it.
