1
00:00:37,903 --> 00:00:41,305
Today evening, you'll have to
come with me.

2
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,649
I cannot do it. - How is it
possible? - I can't.

3
00:00:45,684 --> 00:00:50,981
Your coming with me
is very important.

4
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:55,759
Last time, I said I'll not be
coming. And you had assured...

5
00:00:55,854 --> 00:01:03,003
Me? I don't want to argue. I'll
come sharp at 8. Be ready.

6
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:05,133
Just listen to me.

7
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:14,089
Why are you shouting
like a lunatic.

8
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:18,942
So you are hiding here, & the
house is in darkness.

9
00:04:18,977 --> 00:04:22,397
Where is Bunty. - Here is
your suit. Get ready.

10
00:04:25,464 --> 00:04:32,412
Where is Rosy? - With Bunty.
- And Bunty? - At Ranjits.

11
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:39,110
Are you angry?
You are not going to talk?

12
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:50,400
No? OK I'm sorry. I have said
sorry & you can forgive me.

13
00:04:50,423 --> 00:05:00,509
OK, I will touch my ears.
What is this miserliness?

14
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:03,805
What was the reason to talk
so rudely on telephone?

15
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:11,685
I got annoyed when you
declined. Now you smile.

16
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:22,420
Where had you gone?
- To Ranjit uncle's house.

17
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:28,600
What happened there? - There
Titu got such a big elephant!

18
00:05:28,635 --> 00:05:34,039
That was a toy. I'll get you
a real elephant.

19
00:05:34,074 --> 00:05:42,116
But our door is so small.
- But I forgot.

20
00:05:42,142 --> 00:05:45,715
The door is too small. See
how clever is our son.

21
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:49,652
Don't worry I'll get you a big
train. - The marriage one.

22
00:05:49,687 --> 00:05:58,599
Yes, the marriage one.
- Here comes Johny.

23
00:05:58,634 --> 00:06:07,511
How are you, Johny.
He has no language!

24
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:11,507
There comes your Aunty.
So I'll make a move.

25
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:18,948
Sheela, you know what
happened? - What?

26
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:22,352
You know the one in no. 12?
Yes, what happened?

27
00:06:22,387 --> 00:06:28,344
Please tie your dog,
I am terribly scared.

28
00:06:28,379 --> 00:06:34,301
Johny really loves you.
Am I a dog or what!

29
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:40,538
Yes, you were saying something.
- I was telling you of Ghansh's...

30
00:06:40,573 --> 00:06:43,472
... daughter who used to give
signals to some one.

31
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:49,879
She has run away. And the one
in No 16! Her face has become...

32
00:06:49,914 --> 00:06:56,256
... black. She got drunk, & her
husband beat her so badly...

33
00:06:56,282 --> 00:07:02,658
Do you gain anything by this
gossip- No. Are you going out?

34
00:07:02,693 --> 00:07:07,947
Yes. I am going to a party. It is
from his office side.

35
00:07:07,982 --> 00:07:13,203
My husband never takes me for
a party. He goes alone.

36
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:19,278
Do you drink at parties? - Do I
look like Shanti from No 16.

37
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:22,878
No, I don't know what happens at
parties. My husband only takes...

38
00:07:22,913 --> 00:07:29,437
... me to Congress party. Other
parties he goes alone.

39
00:07:29,472 --> 00:07:35,886
I am ready. Auntie. Can you look
after our Johny?

40
00:07:35,921 --> 00:07:41,299
No, no. I have to go somewhere.
- At least tell us latest news!

41
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:48,939
OK, say good night to Daddy. -
Papa, where are you going?

42
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:56,977
I am going to get you a car!-
You say that but you never...

43
00:07:57,013 --> 00:08:02,086
... bring me any toys. - This time
I am going to get you toys.

44
00:08:02,121 --> 00:08:06,156
Now you go to sleep quietly.
Rosy, take him.

45
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:22,321
Come, let me see how you look.
Now what has happened?

46
00:08:22,356 --> 00:08:28,380
Look we are going to a party.
Therefore you smile!

47
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:34,419
What use, everyday you take me
to a party, and ask me to smile.

48
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:40,592
I too don't want to go. If I don't
the bosses are unhappy, and if...

49
00:08:40,627 --> 00:08:44,961
... I go you are annoyed. But
nowadays, to progress in life...

50
00:08:44,996 --> 00:08:46,824
... one has to do all
these things.

51
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,293
Man makes progress by hard
work or by going to parties.

52
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:52,265
If I depend on only hard work,
we will have to continue living...

53
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,203
... in company flat, and we will
have no house, no servants and...

54
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:57,868
... neither will we be able to get
Bunty married. - Why?

55
00:08:57,903 --> 00:09:01,910
You are a total fool. Nowadays
careers are made only in parties.

56
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:05,681
By drinking contacts increase.
With contacts there are...

57
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:09,684
... rises in salaries.
Who asks about hard work!

58
00:09:09,719 --> 00:09:13,518
Again, you are upset.
Ok, from tomorrow, I'll...

59
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:17,928
... not go to any bum's parties.
- What is this language?

60
00:09:17,963 --> 00:09:22,065
In Bombay this is the
routine language!

61
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:28,871
I'll reform, if you are
close to me.

62
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:47,922
Don't go outside.

63
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:11,080
Look somebody has iust hit
him with a knife and run away.

64
00:10:11,115 --> 00:10:13,911
Do you recognise him?

65
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:17,720
I don't, but he has to be taken
to hospital, or he will die.

66
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:23,461
Come on, police will trouble you
and you will have to go to court!

67
00:10:23,496 --> 00:10:26,662
Police will not. And we have
to help him...

68
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:31,735
No, I don't want to land into
trouble, Driver! Move.

69
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,958
One man is severely iniured.
He has to be hospitalised...

70
00:10:55,993 --> 00:10:59,523
Are you listening?

71
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:04,502
Yes I have. First you drive your
car on to poor people and then...

72
00:11:04,537 --> 00:11:08,199
... you want to shout at us!

73
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:12,642
You are presuming. I was coming
on Worli seaface road, when...

74
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:17,181
... someone stabbed this man. I
just picked & brought him here.

75
00:11:17,216 --> 00:11:22,546
Why did you? Why didn't you
report to the police.

76
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:28,591
There was no police there.
- Why didn't you phone or...

77
00:11:28,626 --> 00:11:34,601
... go to the police station?
- Ok, we will inform them.

78
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:48,377
I am scared of sitting in the car.

79
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:53,511
Just hurry up, I've to go.
- Where?- To a Party.

80
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:59,524
Look, it will take time. Let police
come, give your statement &...

81
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:02,558
... then you may go.

82
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:26,615
I will be giving my statement
to the police.

83
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:31,015
When will the policeman come?
- He is coming.

84
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:35,225
When is he coming. so much time
has passed. I haven't see any.

85
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:39,029
Don't shout. He will come. Don't
pester. Sit down. Sit.

86
00:12:39,064 --> 00:12:42,065
These guys don't have
any decency.

87
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:46,535
Sergeant, this gentleman has
brought a stabbed victim.

88
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:55,144
Sergeant, can you please hurry
up. - Wait!

89
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:03,786
So you brought him here? - Yes.
From where? - Worli Sea face.

90
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:07,723
At what time? - Around 8:15
What were you doing there?

91
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:12,730
We were passing through!
- Where to? - Party.

92
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:16,299
Which party?- Company party.
Why didn't you try and stop...

93
00:13:16,334 --> 00:13:19,434
... the culprit. -
He had run away by then.

94
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:23,873
Do you recognise the culprit?
- Excuse me, send me to jail!

95
00:13:23,908 --> 00:13:29,874
This man will now die
because of you!

96
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:33,750
Why are you shouting? This is a
hospital. Don't shout.

97
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:38,989
Were there any ornaments?
- What do you mean?

98
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:44,162
I mean ring, chain etc... - You
can search us. - I just asked.

99
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:48,197
You can leave giving your
name & address.

100
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:53,668
Here is my card!

101
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,838
You will have to come to the
police station.

102
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:07,316
How has he been left like this?
Very careless ward boy.

103
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:17,328
A lot of blood has flown.
Nurse, Get a needle.

104
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:34,877
What happened? - There was
somebody hidden here.

105
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:37,908
Somebody was here, and he
has run away?

106
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:43,654
Who could be here? You are
under an illusion. Take out the...

107
00:14:43,689 --> 00:14:46,588
... needle and take it down.

108
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:06,640
Come over, man!
- Let me have a drink first.

109
00:15:06,675 --> 00:15:09,307
I thought, you have come
to say farewell!

110
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:13,214
There was a problem. - Is
this the time to come?

111
00:15:13,249 --> 00:15:16,914
Enroute I had to take a
man to the hospital.

112
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:21,306
Did you run over him? I know
someone in police. I'll talk to him

113
00:15:21,341 --> 00:15:25,662
Will you let me talk. I saw some
one lying stabbed on the road...

114
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:28,997
... so you took him to the
hospital. Are you going to get...

115
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:32,001
... something from the government,
or are you fighting elections...

116
00:15:32,036 --> 00:15:35,988
... and you want publicity? -
That man was dying by the road!

117
00:15:36,024 --> 00:15:39,870
You should have let him!
- Look, this is Bombay, even...

118
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:48,756
... if you see a murder, iust be
quiet. - Just quietly move on.

119
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:50,918
Make me another drink.

120
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:59,744
Well, he has done a good deed.
Results are bound to be good

121
00:15:59,779 --> 00:16:05,237
Walking on the road of truth,
there are bound to be problems, . .

122
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:12,412
... but the final result is always
good. - Thank you.

123
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:24,852
Don't drink too much,
understood? - Yes.

124
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:38,929
Come have a drink.
- I do not drink.

125
00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:45,177
You look modern, but you don't
drink! -I'm still not that modern.

126
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,793
When did you come to Bombay?
- Some days back.

127
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:15,405
How are you? - I'm fine, & how
are you? Got married?

128
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:20,982
With whom. I loved a guy, but
he did not like me.

129
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:31,049
What do you do nowadays?
- I sing in clubs. Why not...

130
00:17:31,084 --> 00:17:41,170
... celebrate. You sing, I'll dance.
- After leaving College, I left...

131
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:47,238
... singing and dancing.
- Come, only once, for me.

132
00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:30,883
The night is going away
let us & go and meet...

133
00:18:30,918 --> 00:18:50,148
... somewhere and spend
it together.

134
00:19:02,175 --> 00:19:05,514
Why are you quiet?
Come & sing with me.

135
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:23,611
The time & the desire are there
Come into my arms & let's love.

136
00:19:23,646 --> 00:20:19,741
Let the lovers burn their
passions together.

137
00:20:54,454 --> 00:21:00,966
What is there in this glass,
that can fill my thirst.

138
00:21:01,227 --> 00:21:11,380
You have to fulfil my
lifelong thirst

139
00:21:12,238 --> 00:21:19,085
Come near me so much that
the heart beats increase

140
00:21:19,212 --> 00:21:28,730
With the support of your body,
you fly along with me.

141
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:34,224
What is this? - Ok, And you put
your arm around her at the...

142
00:22:34,254 --> 00:22:37,093
... party at night, then it is ok!
- At a party if a girl invites...

143
00:22:37,128 --> 00:22:40,195
... and you decline, it is
considered bad manners.

144
00:22:40,226 --> 00:22:44,881
Go on! Showing legs, hugging
somebody, is good manners!

145
00:22:44,916 --> 00:22:49,597
I iust danced at the party and
you are raising a cry! Come!

146
00:22:49,632 --> 00:22:54,278
Do you think I am a sleeping
doll. Just call her at night!

147
00:22:54,313 --> 00:22:55,973
Don't talk crap, Sheelu!

148
00:22:56,009 --> 00:22:58,276
I'm your wife, don't show
your eyes to me.

149
00:22:58,311 --> 00:23:01,617
Let such a wife go to hell, get
out of the room! - You go!

150
00:23:01,781 --> 00:23:02,782
This room is mine.
- This house is mine.

151
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:06,589
I am the master of this house.
- I am the mistress!

152
00:23:06,624 --> 00:23:10,188
Go! Showing me eyes!

153
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:15,526
I iust sang, and she thinks
I've committed a sin!

154
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:23,076
She thinks, I cannot stay
without her. -You can't stay.

155
00:23:28,441 --> 00:23:31,562
I earn, I work, and she says
the house is hers!

156
00:23:31,597 --> 00:23:34,683
I cook, and I produce babies, and
the house is his!

157
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:43,220
Johnny, why do you bark, &
remind me of my wife.

158
00:24:43,255 --> 00:24:45,850
Is your wife very short
tempered?

159
00:24:45,885 --> 00:24:50,761
She is ferocious. Sometimes I
wander if she my wife or...

160
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:59,006
... Dacoit Mangal Singh.
Why are you barking so much.

161
00:24:59,032 --> 00:25:04,075
Your health will fail. - Today
the milk is also very thin.

162
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:09,807
It is the rainy season. -
Does it mean you add water!

163
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:20,096
The cows drink too much of
water. So it comes in the milk.

164
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:30,099
How are you? - Fine with
your blessings.

165
00:25:36,135 --> 00:25:41,312
You have soiled my cheek. -
Why? - You have kissed...

166
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:45,549
... without washing your face!

167
00:25:45,578 --> 00:25:51,353
Ok, I'm sorry. Now for that,
you give me a kiss. - No.

168
00:25:51,388 --> 00:25:57,129
First go & wash your face.
- Now who taught you this?

169
00:25:57,156 --> 00:26:02,400
My teacher - These women
have lost their brains.

170
00:26:02,428 --> 00:26:05,867
What?
- It is beyond you.

171
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:18,548
Very bad, you have not brushed
your teeth, and you'r having tea!.

172
00:26:18,578 --> 00:26:23,821
You don't know. By drinking tea
in morning, teeth become strong!

173
00:26:31,524 --> 00:26:34,630
It is school time now.

174
00:26:45,505 --> 00:26:47,876
Stand properly or I'll not put
on your shoes.

175
00:26:52,078 --> 00:26:55,684
Johnny, get my bag.

176
00:26:55,815 --> 00:27:00,758
There are no buttons on any
shirt! - Why do you have to...

177
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:06,998
... shout, I'll fix it.

178
00:27:07,027 --> 00:27:12,637
What was the use of getting
married? You should oversee...

179
00:27:12,765 --> 00:27:15,971
... all this. What do you do the
whole day?

180
00:27:22,842 --> 00:27:26,898
Whole day I'm busy looking after
the house and the kid. Bu why...

181
00:27:26,933 --> 00:27:30,945
... do you daily lose your buttons?
- What do you mean by that?

182
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:34,957
I was iust asking. - I love 10
girls together. You've objections?

183
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:39,996
in love one breaks heads, then
how do you break buttons?

184
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:44,499
You have 3 almirahs, then what
is this blouse doing here?

185
00:27:44,534 --> 00:27:48,938
I keep them in my almirah, but
somehow they come here...

186
00:27:48,973 --> 00:27:53,010
... it looks they are in love
with your clothes.

187
00:27:53,045 --> 00:27:56,012
Please fix the buttons.

188
00:28:02,248 --> 00:28:04,418
Up!

189
00:28:19,232 --> 00:28:22,004
You please smile less, and pay
attention to the button.

190
00:28:22,039 --> 00:28:24,835
Or you may stitch the
button on my neck.

191
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:30,715
What happens to you in the
morning. At night, I am pretty.

192
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:39,494
Hurry up. My neck is paining. -
OK, but come soon in the evening

193
00:28:39,529 --> 00:28:44,013
We have to go someplace. -
Where? I'm not coming.

194
00:28:44,048 --> 00:28:48,496
I will take you there.
- But if I don't go, then?

195
00:28:51,797 --> 00:29:02,018
Think it over, you will stand to
lose. Will you come? - OK.

196
00:29:04,444 --> 00:29:06,581
I will make breakfast.

197
00:29:15,988 --> 00:29:20,063
Gatekeeper, the man to clean the
car hasn't come again.

198
00:29:20,098 --> 00:29:22,664
He is in shift in the afternoon.

199
00:29:54,927 --> 00:29:56,860
What is this?

200
00:29:56,895 --> 00:30:05,869
I said sorry. Gorkha, clean up
the tall man's car.

201
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:13,020
Clean the car! Black fatso!
What people are living here!

202
00:30:20,286 --> 00:30:23,554
My watch is left inside. - Wait.
I am having a bath.

203
00:30:23,589 --> 00:30:27,196
I am getting late. - What can I
do now. Wait for 5 minutes.

204
00:30:35,568 --> 00:30:50,064
My watch. - Get out!

205
00:30:54,453 --> 00:30:59,990
How are you?- Fine,
who are you?

206
00:31:00,026 --> 00:31:04,968
How is he? -who? - The person
whom you took to the hospital.

207
00:31:05,004 --> 00:31:07,332
At the moment he is unconscious,
but who are you?

208
00:31:07,367 --> 00:31:12,543
Well, he should die then, else
we will not let you live.

209
00:31:19,812 --> 00:31:25,216
Well, you know a lot about
smuggling, but of this you...

210
00:31:25,251 --> 00:31:37,942
. . don't know. A man gets stabbed
on the street and the police says

211
00:31:37,977 --> 00:31:45,612
it doesn't know a thing. His
family will be on the streets...

212
00:31:45,647 --> 00:32:29,859
... if he dies. - The police will
trace the culprit out!

213
00:32:35,088 --> 00:32:43,594
How have the press attacked
the police today?

214
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:52,780
We feel under threat. Next
time we publish an article we...

215
00:32:52,815 --> 00:32:57,948
... have to worry we may be next
to be stabbed.

216
00:32:57,983 --> 00:33:00,845
We are losing
faith in the police.

217
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:10,733
Police like you are human beings.
They too can't forecast a crime.

218
00:33:10,823 --> 00:33:19,073
But you press people do
forecast. Why couldn't you...

219
00:33:19,098 --> 00:33:25,923
... anticipate the attempt on
Verma? Fact is Police & press...

220
00:33:25,958 --> 00:33:32,749
... are two strong pillars of
society. If we work together, ...

221
00:33:32,845 --> 00:33:39,024
... we can achieve a lot. For this
case we have appointed Yadav...

222
00:33:39,052 --> 00:33:47,601
... for the investigations. He is
capable & you need not worry

223
00:33:48,894 --> 00:33:55,900
One more thing, if you do find
out anything about Verma, do...

224
00:33:55,935 --> 00:34:02,648
... consult us before publishing it.
We will be grateful. Questions?

225
00:34:12,985 --> 00:34:15,190
Sergeant, close the door.

226
00:34:15,221 --> 00:34:23,337
Verma told me once, he is going
to lift a veil from a very...

227
00:34:23,363 --> 00:34:27,504
... important man. In real life he
pretends to be honest, pious &...

228
00:34:27,533 --> 00:34:33,111
... straight forward, but is infact
a depraved, corrupt & fallen man.

229
00:34:33,146 --> 00:34:36,612
What is his name? - That is
what he didn't say. He said...

230
00:34:36,647 --> 00:34:39,143
... his work is still unfinished.

231
00:34:39,178 --> 00:34:45,324
Ok, thank you very much. -
Till we meet again.

232
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:52,065
Yadav, the responsibility
is now yours.

233
00:34:53,259 --> 00:34:56,632
Shekhar, put a double guard on
Verma's room. Nobody should...

234
00:34:56,667 --> 00:34:59,634
... be allowed without permission.

235
00:35:02,068 --> 00:35:12,087
Who can escape God's decision?
- But Doctor had said he'll live.

236
00:35:12,145 --> 00:35:21,263
Who is he? - He is dead. - But
what about the patient I got?

237
00:35:21,287 --> 00:35:24,126
He is in Room No 11.

238
00:35:38,438 --> 00:35:43,614
I'm Amit Shrivastav. - You are
the one who got the patient...

239
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:46,814
... to the hospital.
- How is he?

240
00:35:46,879 --> 00:35:52,056
Still unconscous. We are
doing our best.

241
00:35:56,089 --> 00:36:06,142
Son, you have saved my son's
life. I am grateful. Tell me, ...

242
00:36:06,177 --> 00:36:20,011
... do you think he will
be alright?

243
00:36:20,046 --> 00:36:24,487
If there is God, & he doesn't
support criminals, your son...

244
00:36:24,522 --> 00:36:28,124
... will become alright.

245
00:36:34,927 --> 00:36:43,110
You have saved my husband. I
can't forget ever the favor done.

246
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:50,513
It was my duty, you cannot say
it was a favor done.

247
00:36:50,548 --> 00:36:56,920
What has happened to dad?
- You trouble him, isn't it?

248
00:36:56,955 --> 00:37:03,294
I'll never trouble him. Will he be
alright? - Yes, son.

249
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:11,267
OK, mother, I will take leave.

250
00:37:31,251 --> 00:37:33,989
All well, Colorful clothes,
colorful mood?!

251
00:37:40,293 --> 00:37:44,315
What happened, are you leaving
the job? - Where will you get...

252
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:48,338
... a iob like this one. Your IQ
has gone down. Double your...

253
00:37:48,367 --> 00:37:56,617
... dose of Glaxo D. I'm taking
interview of 25 girls.

254
00:37:56,809 --> 00:38:05,960
Be careful, else you will lose
your job, one day!

255
00:38:05,984 --> 00:38:12,890
Why? I was iust ioking. Friend,
we need a lift.

256
00:38:12,925 --> 00:38:16,999
After last night's party, I sweat
when climbing stairs.

257
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:22,573
I advise you to drink Glaxo D in
the morning before setting out.

258
00:38:22,608 --> 00:38:25,307
Its made in our own factory!

259
00:39:05,311 --> 00:39:08,383
When is Mr Desai's interview?
I have cancelled it as there is...

260
00:39:08,414 --> 00:39:12,588
... an emergency meeting & you
have been called to the theatre.

261
00:39:12,785 --> 00:39:14,388
Now? - Yes.

262
00:39:29,335 --> 00:39:32,970
Many types of people with
different dress, habits and...

263
00:39:33,006 --> 00:39:37,147
... eating habits live in India.
But whenever they are tired, ...

264
00:39:37,177 --> 00:39:41,512
... they take GLAXO D.

265
00:39:41,547 --> 00:39:51,533
Of all our ads, I have
chosen this one.

266
00:39:51,568 --> 00:39:57,469
What do you think of this?

267
00:40:07,907 --> 00:40:10,474
Amit, I want to say a
few things to you.

268
00:40:10,509 --> 00:40:17,382
I observed your wife was unable
to adjust to our parties.

269
00:40:17,417 --> 00:40:24,597
I have told her it is a part of
duty, but she doesn't understand.

270
00:40:24,623 --> 00:40:29,233
You are fortunate, that in todays
times you have such a simple...

271
00:40:29,268 --> 00:40:32,367
... & educated wife. You should
feel proud of it.

272
00:40:43,343 --> 00:40:47,517
What is it? - I remembered you.
I thought, why not talk to you!

273
00:40:47,546 --> 00:40:55,186
Remembered me! What is it, is
there one more party?

274
00:40:55,221 --> 00:41:00,164
No, not at all. Why? - Generally
your call comes for a party.

275
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:04,462
Enough, no more! After
yesterday's party, no more!

276
00:41:04,497 --> 00:41:13,481
No more parties from today, OK?
- Yes, come soon in the evening

277
00:41:13,516 --> 00:41:18,349
You have to come with me.
- Yes, I remember.

278
00:41:31,157 --> 00:41:34,158
Mr. Salim, you have made this
Ad? - Yes.

279
00:41:34,193 --> 00:41:38,365
Do you think Glaxo Company
makes lipsticks? - No.

280
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,888
Does it make fashion apparel?
- Certainly not.

281
00:41:42,923 --> 00:41:48,721
Then what is this? Who chose
it? - It is Mr Tony.

282
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:54,520
Please come here. - Yes. -
Did you approve this?

283
00:41:54,547 --> 00:41:58,688
Certainly not. I told him to
make it more sexy.

284
00:41:58,884 --> 00:42:04,243
Tony, this is a home product
used by families. Imagine seeing. .

285
00:42:04,278 --> 00:42:09,602
... this, what will be the effect?
Mr Salim please go with him...

286
00:42:09,795 --> 00:42:12,267
... and make a decent design.

287
00:42:18,904 --> 00:42:22,373
Did you find a piece of
paper with the man?

288
00:42:22,408 --> 00:42:27,078
Look, you rang me up in the
morning also, who are you?

289
00:42:27,113 --> 00:42:34,293
A torn piece of invitation card,
did you find it? - No. Even if I...

290
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:40,098
... found it... who are you?
- You look from a decent family.

291
00:42:40,133 --> 00:42:49,177
Please don't inform the police
of our telephone talk.

292
00:43:04,917 --> 00:43:09,092
If you have time, I'll like to ask
you about last night's incident.

293
00:43:11,457 --> 00:43:23,214
Definitely. I have a meeting now
& health too is not too good...

294
00:43:23,249 --> 00:43:27,377
That is Ok. I will come some
other time.

295
00:43:27,407 --> 00:43:33,619
Don't take the trouble,
I'll myself come.

296
00:43:33,812 --> 00:43:37,115
No, responsibility is mine.
I'll come.

297
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:40,489
Why don't you call him to the
station? We will save time. And. .

298
00:43:40,524 --> 00:43:44,355
... you know the Bombay traffic.
- Sergeant!

299
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:49,133
You don't come. We will come.
To serve the people is our duty.

300
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:51,329
Sergeant, go outside.

301
00:43:51,364 --> 00:43:55,004
OK, Amit, Thank you very much.

302
00:44:07,447 --> 00:44:10,252
Please heat the water
for him

303
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:22,230
What is it, Amit? why are you
ringing me frequently?

304
00:44:22,261 --> 00:44:32,011
I'll tell. Is the house door
closed? - No, it is open.

305
00:44:32,046 --> 00:44:41,761
I tell you, close the door!-
Speak now, door is closed.

306
00:44:41,847 --> 00:44:45,383
Where is Bunty? - He is
close to me.

307
00:44:45,418 --> 00:44:48,919
What is it, Amit? I feel you are
hiding something from me.

308
00:44:48,954 --> 00:44:56,780
I've heard, a dacoit gang has
come to the city. Finding women...

309
00:44:56,815 --> 00:45:04,607
... alone in house, they enter the
house. They are dangerous.

310
00:45:04,642 --> 00:45:12,452
That is why keep the door
closed till I come. - OK.

311
00:45:22,788 --> 00:45:25,593
Get up, son. Wash your face.

312
00:45:36,469 --> 00:45:43,712
You know that girl in No 19?
She winked at Ranjit's driver.

313
00:45:43,747 --> 00:45:50,956
Aunty, why do you waste time in
all this? What is it to you?

314
00:45:50,991 --> 00:45:55,125
OK, I'll not do it. I will
keep quiet.

315
00:45:56,955 --> 00:46:01,928
My stomach is paining. - Ok,
say it out. It will become ok.

316
00:46:01,963 --> 00:46:07,020
In No. 21 there was a big fight
between husband & wife.

317
00:46:07,055 --> 00:46:12,076
Don't talk of others. - OK, but
why did U close the odor?o

318
00:46:13,339 --> 00:46:15,543
His phone had come?
- But for what?

319
00:46:15,575 --> 00:46:19,582
Again you have started! - But I
am asking about you.

320
00:46:19,812 --> 00:46:24,919
Thieves have entered the city,
who enter houses & kill women.

321
00:46:24,954 --> 00:46:30,027
Why do they kill women? - They
think today's women are spoilt.

322
00:46:30,062 --> 00:46:35,100
Yes, see that one in No. 19.
They spoil the name of women.

323
00:46:35,135 --> 00:46:44,145
He will bite me. Leave me.

324
00:46:49,875 --> 00:46:52,463
Some body has broken
your car glass.

325
00:46:52,498 --> 00:46:55,051
Who has broken? - I don't
know, sir.

326
00:46:55,081 --> 00:47:03,931
It has never happened before.
First time, it has ever happened.

327
00:47:03,966 --> 00:47:11,238
Did you find a piece of paper?
- A piece of paper.

328
00:48:00,813 --> 00:48:04,654
Amit, You are getting late. Hurry
up. - Coming.

329
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:10,188
It is done! - OK, what
do you want?

330
00:48:10,223 --> 00:48:16,131
Come!- Where? - There is a
place. I'll take you to a good...

331
00:48:16,166 --> 00:48:21,866
... place, where there are no
half-dressed dancing women!

332
00:48:21,901 --> 00:48:26,477
Once is enough. If you keep on
repeating like this, I will...

333
00:48:26,512 --> 00:48:34,988
Come! - Should I? - Ok.
he is also like his father.

334
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:40,956
Switch off the lights.
Come!

335
00:48:43,489 --> 00:48:49,033
Johny, go inside. - Mom. we will
take Johnny along with us.

336
00:48:49,068 --> 00:48:52,330
We can't take Johnny to the
place, we are going!

337
00:48:52,365 --> 00:48:55,070
But where are we going?
Keep quiet. Johnny go inside.

338
00:48:55,105 --> 00:48:59,209
Rosy is not there. She has
taken a holiday.

339
00:48:59,239 --> 00:49:02,807
You tell him, he will listen
to you.

340
00:49:02,842 --> 00:49:07,218
Go, Johnny! We will go
together tomorrow.

341
00:49:07,253 --> 00:49:11,354
Put off the light. Johnny
go inside.

342
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:57,099
Is Mr Amit at home?

343
00:50:12,611 --> 00:50:15,784
At the age of 7, your
father died.

344
00:50:15,815 --> 00:50:20,858
After that mother
brought you up.

345
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:28,201
You worked while studying. You
taught your brother and sister.

346
00:50:28,227 --> 00:50:32,235
You got your sister married.
After that you married.

347
00:50:38,571 --> 00:50:43,107
After that there has been no
problem in your life.

348
00:50:43,142 --> 00:50:50,423
The next three days will be very
difficult and full of misfortunes.

349
00:50:54,087 --> 00:50:56,291
What sort of misfortunes, Uncle?

350
00:50:56,322 --> 00:51:00,963
There will be a threat to life.
It will effect the light...

351
00:51:00,998 --> 00:51:05,163
... in your house. There will
be darkness.

352
00:51:05,198 --> 00:51:10,868
Is there a solution?
- Yes, only your courage.

353
00:51:10,903 --> 00:51:20,656
The next three days will have to
be faced with courage.

354
00:51:20,691 --> 00:51:24,220
Only after that will
come your success.

355
00:51:24,255 --> 00:51:27,390
Otherwise...
- Otherwise?

356
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:33,431
As god wills.

357
00:51:49,509 --> 00:51:52,514
There is blood on Johnny.

358
00:51:58,151 --> 00:52:01,257
Where has the biscuit
come from?

359
00:52:01,287 --> 00:52:04,393
Mummy, what has happened
to my Johnny?

360
00:52:16,869 --> 00:52:22,113
Who is it? -Have you forgotten?
- Yes, it is not your fault.

361
00:52:22,142 --> 00:52:26,283
Look you rascal, If you think I'll
be scared of your threats...

362
00:52:26,312 --> 00:52:30,015
Who is it? - Just a minute.

363
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:33,189
No threats, I'm asking for
that piece of paper.

364
00:52:33,224 --> 00:52:35,157
You will not get
that piece of paper.

365
00:52:35,188 --> 00:52:40,491
You have a wife and a child.

366
00:52:40,526 --> 00:52:43,894
For a piece of paper, you
cannot lose their lives.

367
00:52:43,929 --> 00:52:48,638
Tomorrow come down to Westend
Watch company at 6 pm or else.

368
00:52:48,673 --> 00:52:50,972
... like the dog. .

369
00:52:54,174 --> 00:52:57,179
What is it? You are hiding
something from me.

370
00:52:57,243 --> 00:52:59,313
It is the same guy.
- Which guy?

371
00:52:59,345 --> 00:53:03,150
This man is asking why I saved
the man yesterday. He is asking...

372
00:53:03,185 --> 00:53:06,955
... for a piece of paper, & is
threatening me that if I don't...

373
00:53:06,990 --> 00:53:10,727
... He will...

374
00:53:11,024 --> 00:53:19,073
The coming three days are most
difficult & full of misfortunes.

375
00:53:22,568 --> 00:53:26,171
What are you doing? - Ringing
up the police, what else.

376
00:53:26,206 --> 00:53:30,113
Don't. If he comes to know you
rang up the police, he will...

377
00:53:30,148 --> 00:53:31,976
... become your enemy.

378
00:53:32,012 --> 00:53:35,118
So you think, if we don't then,
he will become our friend. .

379
00:53:35,153 --> 00:53:37,318
Today he has killed our Johnny,
tomorrow he may...

380
00:53:37,353 --> 00:53:41,625
What has happened to Johnny?

381
00:53:54,367 --> 00:54:00,712
Take him.
- My Johnny!

382
00:54:06,512 --> 00:54:10,486
Johnny is being taken to the
doctor. He is not well.

383
00:54:13,319 --> 00:54:16,458
Please take him inside.

384
00:54:22,895 --> 00:54:25,967
You have seen all this! The
murderer rang & threatened you

385
00:54:25,998 --> 00:54:30,140
And yet you kept quiet? You
acted without responsibility.

386
00:54:30,175 --> 00:54:35,146
But the phone... - We could have
tapped the line.

387
00:54:35,175 --> 00:54:39,431
There are many methods, but
you spoilt everything.

388
00:54:39,466 --> 00:54:43,687
I'm sorry. - Your dog will not
become alive by this.

389
00:54:43,722 --> 00:54:46,288
Thank your stars, the dog ate
the biscuit.

390
00:54:46,323 --> 00:54:49,325
Suppose your son
had eaten it?

391
00:54:49,355 --> 00:54:58,706
Look Mr Amit, man should be
honest but not adamant.

392
00:54:58,864 --> 00:55:03,974
Don't get too worried. Just
be careful in future.

393
00:55:04,003 --> 00:55:07,471
Yes, don't worry. We will get
the culprit like this.

394
00:55:07,506 --> 00:55:14,954
You do your work. Amit, can I
get a glass of water? - Me too.

395
00:55:14,989 --> 00:55:21,060
Sergeant, is it necessary that
you do whatever I do?

396
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:25,028
There are 2 biscuits of poison
here. I am taking one, you take 1

397
00:55:25,063 --> 00:55:26,927
No, I had my lunch!

398
00:56:08,868 --> 00:56:13,444
To make us laugh one day
and make us cry another day...

399
00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:22,380
... are the old ways
of life

400
00:56:22,415 --> 00:56:44,592
So why do you worry,
but sleep well.

401
00:57:12,398 --> 00:57:31,169
The wind tell you to sleep. The
toys say, go into deep slumber...

402
00:57:31,204 --> 00:57:42,005
... and dream. Tomorrow will be a
new day, then why worry.

403
00:58:26,439 --> 00:58:33,452
Now life's days will go away
smoothly as life is very long.

404
00:58:33,846 --> 00:58:56,391
Don't cry as God is very good.

405
00:59:49,355 --> 00:59:51,956
Who is it? - What is
your name?

406
00:59:51,991 --> 00:59:55,965
I feel shy. - Tell me your name
For that why do you feel shy?

407
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:00,103
Tell your name, not your
baby's name.

408
01:00:00,133 --> 01:00:04,805
I am tellling you my name. I am
not married, so how'll baby come

409
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:09,479
Why didn't you get married? - I
didn't find a gentleman like you.

410
01:00:11,511 --> 01:00:16,280
How many biscuits do you have?
- You want? They are all spoilt.

411
01:00:16,315 --> 01:00:25,467
... It is all cheap stuff. Why don't
your raid them. I know that area.

412
01:00:25,491 --> 01:00:28,663
Not that! I am asking about the
poisonous ones whom you gave...

413
01:00:28,861 --> 01:00:31,666
... to the dog!
- What? I killed the dog.

414
01:00:31,701 --> 01:00:34,965
You had a fight with Amit.
correct?

415
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:41,046
You said sorry. But you were
burning for revenge, Correct?

416
01:00:41,107 --> 01:00:45,348
So you fed his dog with
poisonous biscuits, is it right?

417
01:00:48,181 --> 01:00:52,722
See my brains. I'm in police for
20 years, but still no one made...

418
01:00:52,851 --> 01:00:54,485
... me an inspector.

419
01:00:54,520 --> 01:01:00,698
Why would I kill the dog. He
was nice, just like my brother.

420
01:01:00,733 --> 01:01:07,707
I feel this woman killed the dog.
She hated him.

421
01:01:07,742 --> 01:01:13,946
When will you return?

422
01:01:29,055 --> 01:01:34,165
Come to the police station. You
are a murderer. I've a witness.

423
01:01:34,194 --> 01:01:36,461
Come, otherwise I will bring
a warrant.

424
01:01:36,496 --> 01:01:44,511
I loved that dog, but I am
scared of taking injections.

425
01:01:44,546 --> 01:01:58,949
Believe me I did not murder
that dog. - Don't cry!

426
01:01:58,984 --> 01:02:10,574
I know who instigated you
against me. - Don't cry, what...

427
01:02:10,609 --> 01:02:15,466
... will people think of me?

428
01:02:15,501 --> 01:02:29,362
The dog died of a poisonous
biscuit, & police have to suffer!

429
01:02:35,621 --> 01:02:40,797
How these people park their
cars. They are all donkeys.

430
01:03:10,629 --> 01:03:14,636
That paper is a torn piece of
invitation card.

431
01:03:21,807 --> 01:03:24,979
It appears a part of a
invitation card.

432
01:03:25,011 --> 01:03:29,400
What is so unique about it that
the culprit is so worried.

433
01:03:29,435 --> 01:03:33,790
Sergeant, if your brain keeps
functioning like this...

434
01:03:33,819 --> 01:03:36,754
... then there is no chance of your
becoming an Inspector.

435
01:03:36,789 --> 01:03:44,037
It is simple, that card must have
been with the killer before the...

436
01:03:44,063 --> 01:03:50,842
... murder, and the torn piece must
have remained with the victim.

437
01:03:50,877 --> 01:03:54,409
So what?
You don't feel so?

438
01:03:54,540 --> 01:03:57,712
Why are we placing so much of
importance on this piece of paper

439
01:03:57,743 --> 01:04:01,984
A criminal wants to remove any
piece of evidence which may...

440
01:04:02,015 --> 01:04:04,548
... lead the police to him.

441
01:04:04,583 --> 01:04:08,290
If he tries to kill Amit, then
Amit can see his face.

442
01:04:12,658 --> 01:04:19,705
Sergeant, go & do your work.
Mr Gupta, that card...

443
01:04:19,765 --> 01:04:25,810
First find out which function was
this, and where and...

444
01:04:25,845 --> 01:04:29,244
... who were the organisers?

445
01:04:37,216 --> 01:04:39,750
What are you thinking?
- Nothing.

446
01:04:39,785 --> 01:04:43,959
Do one iob. Be there at the
Westend watch company from...

447
01:04:43,989 --> 01:04:48,765
... 5:45 to 6:15 in the evening. My
men in civil dress will be there.

448
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:57,345
In addition, we will have a
camera continuously covering you.

449
01:04:57,380 --> 01:05:05,890
This work is dangerous, but you
will be helping society & police.

450
01:05:11,750 --> 01:05:14,655
All right.

451
01:05:31,004 --> 01:05:37,216
Nobody has come.
Give something to me!

452
01:06:05,938 --> 01:06:09,011
Nobody has come.

453
01:06:46,778 --> 01:06:50,953
You think you are clever! Despite
telling you, you brought Police.

454
01:06:50,988 --> 01:06:54,256
You know your wife & kid
are alone at home!

455
01:08:50,769 --> 01:08:52,788
This is inspector Jadhav
speaking.

456
01:08:52,823 --> 01:08:54,808
Yes, go ahead, this is
Amit speaking.

457
01:08:54,840 --> 01:09:02,989
You know about Flora Fountain
activity. It is over. - OK.

458
01:09:04,150 --> 01:09:06,888
Please start.

459
01:09:15,628 --> 01:09:17,365
Come, Amit

460
01:09:23,669 --> 01:09:26,656
During that time, only one man
had come near yu.

461
01:09:26,691 --> 01:09:33,243
Only he could have placed the
note in your pocket.

462
01:09:33,278 --> 01:09:39,795
How was his face? - I didn't
see. I was so tense!

463
01:09:39,818 --> 01:09:52,076
Did you ever come across a man
like that? - No.

464
01:09:57,936 --> 01:10:02,806
Do you remember?
- No, not a thing.

465
01:10:02,841 --> 01:10:16,802
If you can describe him, we will
see our police records.

466
01:10:19,758 --> 01:10:29,811
Think of something - Well
I have brother in law in Kanpur.

467
01:10:34,740 --> 01:10:43,891
From this film it is apparent, he
is no common criminal.

468
01:10:43,926 --> 01:10:49,760
See how cleverly he put that
note in my pocket, ...

469
01:10:49,821 --> 01:10:55,133
... despite the police presence. He
may smoothly eliminate us also.

470
01:10:56,862 --> 01:10:59,434
Don't worry, we have made
proper arrangements for the...

471
01:10:59,532 --> 01:11:01,702
... security of your family.

472
01:11:01,734 --> 01:11:05,842
Let us go, the victim may have
recovered consciousness.

473
01:11:13,679 --> 01:11:16,384
First we will meet the doctor,
and then the patient.

474
01:11:26,959 --> 01:11:31,201
You know him? - Of course,
how can one forget such...

475
01:11:31,230 --> 01:11:34,169
... brave people. - Why are you
embarrasing me. - Not you.

476
01:11:34,204 --> 01:11:36,600
I am embarrasing the inspector.

477
01:11:36,635 --> 01:11:43,682
Mr Amit, he is my friend, Dr
Kailash. We studied together.

478
01:11:43,717 --> 01:11:47,878
When will he become alright?
- Can't say.

479
01:11:47,913 --> 01:11:51,920
There are no chances? - There
are chances, he's getting better.

480
01:11:51,984 --> 01:11:57,195
What sort of a doctor are U? U
can't bring a man to his sesness

481
01:11:57,223 --> 01:12:01,965
What sort of inspector are you?
Can't even catch a criminal!

482
01:12:06,165 --> 01:12:09,767
Doctor, Look after him.
- I know it, don't worry.

483
01:12:09,802 --> 01:12:15,980
One can't really trust a doctor!
- People say the same about...

484
01:12:16,016 --> 01:12:19,848
... the police!
- Come off! Come, Amit.

485
01:12:26,952 --> 01:12:29,357
What are you doing?

486
01:12:33,492 --> 01:12:37,095
Bunty, it is time to sleep.
Rosie, take Bunty.

487
01:12:37,130 --> 01:12:42,006
I am not sleepy. - You are
sleepy, and so is your father.

488
01:12:42,041 --> 01:12:46,526
Go, son, it is time to sleep.
OK, good night.

489
01:12:46,561 --> 01:12:51,013
Rosie, you sleep. I will warm
the dinner myself.

490
01:12:57,916 --> 01:13:01,852
You become very impatient.
Here, eat these fruits.

491
01:13:01,887 --> 01:13:07,145
Today I feel like eating you.
- Careful, suppose she sees!

492
01:13:07,180 --> 01:13:12,402
So what, she will see & go.
- Day be day, you are getting...

493
01:13:12,498 --> 01:13:15,670
... restless. - And you are
becoming beautiful.

494
01:13:15,701 --> 01:13:22,881
Lights have gone.
- So what!

495
01:14:06,585 --> 01:14:09,123
Look up and down, the whole
building lights have gone.

496
01:14:09,158 --> 01:14:13,112
What happened? - Somebody
has stolen the fuse!

497
01:14:13,147 --> 01:14:17,067
How can that be possible?
How long will it take?

498
01:14:17,102 --> 01:14:19,200
It will take a few moments.

499
01:14:19,232 --> 01:14:25,010
How have the lights gone, Amit?
Why aren't you speaking.

500
01:14:25,045 --> 01:14:28,744
Who is it?

501
01:15:02,908 --> 01:15:04,875
Just now a man came in.

502
01:15:04,910 --> 01:15:07,982
He tried to kill me. I knifed him
on his leg, See there, he is...

503
01:15:08,018 --> 01:15:10,714
... trying to run away.

504
01:15:10,749 --> 01:15:14,118
Thief! what happened?
SomeGody came to rob...

505
01:15:14,153 --> 01:15:18,294
... I showed the knife & he ran.
See he is going there.

506
01:15:18,329 --> 01:15:21,296
Thief, thief.

507
01:15:50,622 --> 01:15:57,036
You! You first killed my dog,
& now you tried to kill my wife.

508
01:15:57,071 --> 01:16:11,725
For god's sake, leave me.
- ok, leave him.

509
01:16:16,682 --> 01:16:22,727
Who are you? - I am from CID.
You can check it.

510
01:16:22,788 --> 01:16:25,860
He will not talk here. We will
take him to the Police Station.

511
01:16:29,661 --> 01:16:36,008
He fought like anything. Have you
tied them up? - Yes, yes.

512
01:16:36,043 --> 01:16:41,605
Have a look and identify
that man.

513
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:52,895
He is the person, but don't tell,
otherwise he will kill me.

514
01:17:07,033 --> 01:17:08,699
He is the person.

515
01:17:08,734 --> 01:17:12,975
She is lying, you cannot blame a
poor man like this

516
01:17:13,005 --> 01:17:19,017
Sergeant, lock him up. And the
others, take them this side.

517
01:17:29,555 --> 01:17:33,062
Tell your wife the criminal has
been caught, & there is nothing...

518
01:17:33,097 --> 01:17:35,029
... to worry about.

519
01:17:47,706 --> 01:17:51,113
What is the matter? - It is an
hour now, we haven't had any...

520
01:17:51,148 --> 01:17:52,943
... break for a smoke or water.

521
01:17:52,978 --> 01:17:56,218
This is your father's house? If
you create more ruckus, I'll...

522
01:17:56,248 --> 01:18:03,310
... catch you by the ears,
& throw you out!

523
01:18:03,345 --> 01:18:10,373
Amit, iust listen to me.
I shall be grateful.

524
01:18:18,604 --> 01:18:24,649
I am your culprit but it will take
a long time to prove it, do me...

525
01:18:24,710 --> 01:18:30,855
... a favor, I will not forget it for
life. I'm not saying this so that.

526
01:18:30,883 --> 01:18:40,591
... I seek bail or mercy.
- Then what is it?

527
01:18:40,626 --> 01:18:44,700
Tomorrow is my daughter's
marriage. To arrange for the...

528
01:18:44,735 --> 01:18:49,673
... Mangalsutra, I came out.
Go and tell them that...

529
01:18:49,708 --> 01:18:58,509
... I am away on some
important work.

530
01:18:58,544 --> 01:19:11,889
Where do you stay? - Dharawi,
Room No 110. I am Gopal, my...

531
01:19:11,924 --> 01:19:18,570
... wife is Bimla. Don't tell the
police. Go and ensure that the...

532
01:19:18,605 --> 01:19:25,811
... marriage is not held up.

533
01:19:39,018 --> 01:19:43,587
Why are you crying? Auntie,
she is continuously crying.

534
01:19:43,622 --> 01:19:50,102
Don't cry, your father must be
coming. He must have been held...

535
01:19:50,137 --> 01:19:53,697
... up due to some important work.

536
01:19:53,732 --> 01:19:56,904
Auntie, Gopal Uncle's friend
has come.

537
01:19:56,935 --> 01:20:03,774
Welcome. - Thank you, does
Gopal stay here? - Yes.

538
01:20:03,809 --> 01:20:09,954
He is not at home. Last night he
went out and should be coming.

539
01:20:09,982 --> 01:20:17,859
He has sent me here. - Why
hasn't he come himself. I hope...

540
01:20:17,894 --> 01:20:25,736
No, there is nothing to worry
about. He had to go to Poona...

541
01:20:25,764 --> 01:20:30,273
... to arrange money for the
Mangal Sutra

542
01:20:33,672 --> 01:20:38,415
Then how will the marriage take
place. Where will the chain...

543
01:20:38,511 --> 01:20:43,554
... come from? There is not a
penny in the house. He has been. .

544
01:20:43,616 --> 01:20:53,869
. . sick for a month. Whatever
was in the house is all sold.

545
01:20:56,762 --> 01:21:02,600
You mean for a month, he hasn't
been out at all?

546
01:21:02,635 --> 01:21:10,684
No, I used to get his medicines.
He felt a bit better yesterday...

547
01:21:10,742 --> 01:21:14,984
... & he left to arrange for a
wedding necklace.

548
01:21:26,258 --> 01:21:32,183
Here keep this. - What is this?
- Rs 500. Gopal has sent it.

549
01:21:32,218 --> 01:21:38,108
He said, if he gets late, the
marriage must be held as per...

550
01:21:38,143 --> 01:21:41,777
... schedule under any circumstance

551
01:21:45,211 --> 01:21:49,317
If father does not come, I'll not
go to the marriage tent.

552
01:21:49,352 --> 01:21:53,423
What do you speak! Your father
took so much of trouble, &

553
01:21:53,552 --> 01:21:56,658
... didn't bother about his health,
and now you want to refuse?

554
01:21:59,625 --> 01:22:02,831
I'll try & send him as early as
possible, but this marriage must. .

555
01:22:02,861 --> 01:22:07,670
... not be dalayed in any way.

556
01:22:25,618 --> 01:22:29,759
I had gone to his house. I came
to know he is sick since several.

557
01:22:29,788 --> 01:22:35,900
... days. If he was at home, the
question of killing does not arise.

558
01:22:39,165 --> 01:22:43,673
His daughter is getting married
tomorrow. For that he tried...

559
01:22:43,708 --> 01:22:47,443
... to steal and was caught.

560
01:22:47,539 --> 01:22:52,583
Who gave you his address?
- He gave it himself.

561
01:22:52,645 --> 01:22:56,152
He told me not to tell the police.
Otherwise who will marry...

562
01:22:56,187 --> 01:22:58,652
... a convict's daughter.

563
01:23:01,654 --> 01:23:05,762
Sir, should I give you an idea?
- Sergeant, keep your ideas to...

564
01:23:05,791 --> 01:23:08,963
... yourself.
Amit, please sit down.

565
01:23:14,033 --> 01:23:19,703
Mr Yadav, please leave that man.

566
01:23:19,738 --> 01:23:23,946
How can I leave him. He has
been arrested for theft.

567
01:23:23,976 --> 01:23:30,222
Look, I'll give the bail.
- You!

568
01:23:30,249 --> 01:23:34,957
Look, he is poor. Let us forgive.
At this time this is the best.

569
01:23:34,992 --> 01:23:40,882
What are you looking at?
- I can't believe a man...

570
01:23:40,917 --> 01:23:46,772
... like you are still around.
Well I'll do something.

571
01:23:56,642 --> 01:23:59,781
Look, your bail has been
arranged. You may go.

572
01:23:59,816 --> 01:24:02,250
Sergeant, close the door.

573
01:24:08,187 --> 01:24:11,192
Who gave my bail? - Look,
don't waste time.

574
01:24:11,257 --> 01:24:14,658
Bridegroom is
about to arrive.

575
01:24:14,693 --> 01:24:18,801
Who gave my bail. ? - That is
immaterial. Go quickly now.

576
01:24:24,903 --> 01:24:30,174
I'm a poor man. I can only
offer my blessing.

577
01:24:30,209 --> 01:24:36,854
May God give you a very long
life. - Just listen to me!

578
01:24:36,889 --> 01:24:40,022
I can offer my life. Call me
anytime, I will come.

579
01:24:40,053 --> 01:24:53,045
Just listen! At this time, iust go
home. Your daughter is waiting.

580
01:25:38,977 --> 01:25:41,882
Will you have a chocolate?
- Who are you?

581
01:25:41,917 --> 01:25:46,823
Come have a chocolate. Come...

582
01:25:49,788 --> 01:25:56,933
This is Yadav speaking.
- What are you doing there?

583
01:25:56,968 --> 01:26:04,079
You come here, I'll tell you
everything. - What is it?

584
01:26:04,114 --> 01:26:12,686
Bunty is missing.
- Bunty? Ok, I'm coming.

585
01:26:26,525 --> 01:26:34,374
Get me my Bunty back. - But
what happened? - Ask the maid.

586
01:26:36,535 --> 01:26:42,713
I was there in the park. I was
with the other women.

587
01:26:42,741 --> 01:26:48,786
Suddenly, I noticed that
Bunty is missing.

588
01:26:48,847 --> 01:26:51,986
Where are you going?

589
01:26:52,018 --> 01:26:55,519
I will kill that bastard. I will
kill him! - Whom?

590
01:26:55,554 --> 01:27:01,563
Where will you trace him? Amit
your one act can compromise...

591
01:27:01,598 --> 01:27:07,572
... Bunty's life. This is not your
job. Leave it to the police.

592
01:27:07,607 --> 01:27:12,709
Thank you. Police have done
great favors on me. .

593
01:27:12,738 --> 01:27:15,106
I don't need any more
favors. Understood?

594
01:27:15,141 --> 01:27:20,064
What do the police do? Every
day they create a new problem.

595
01:27:20,099 --> 01:27:24,987
And you iust stand gaping. Police
had taken the responsibility.

596
01:27:25,023 --> 01:27:35,237
Then what happened? Then how
is Bunty lost? Go get away.

597
01:27:35,261 --> 01:27:39,963
I neither want your help nor
your sympathies.

598
01:27:39,998 --> 01:27:45,008
It is not the time to debate all
this. Look at your wife's state.

599
01:27:45,043 --> 01:27:49,673
They are doing some new
plans everyday. And we are...

600
01:27:49,708 --> 01:27:57,356
... unable to catch them. Amit, I
will stake my life to save Bunty.

601
01:28:01,853 --> 01:28:04,993
Let us go, Sergeant.

602
01:28:20,073 --> 01:28:23,941
How are you?
- Where is Bunty.

603
01:28:23,976 --> 01:28:27,550
Without Bunty, the house
must be biting you!

604
01:28:27,585 --> 01:28:29,717
I'll not leave you alive.

605
01:28:29,748 --> 01:28:33,771
These empty threats are not
going to solve problems.

606
01:28:33,806 --> 01:28:37,794
Accept their demands, but
please get me my son back.

607
01:28:38,991 --> 01:28:47,108
You are an educated man, and
they don't abuse. Take care of...

608
01:28:47,133 --> 01:28:52,743
What do you want? - Now you
are talking business. Open your...

609
01:28:52,778 --> 01:28:57,815
... door and there will be a
packet. - Where is Bunty?

610
01:28:57,843 --> 01:29:03,854
Don't waste time. Go and
fetch that packet.

611
01:29:23,502 --> 01:29:28,745
I want my Bunty back. - Sheela
don't talk to them.

612
01:29:32,244 --> 01:29:45,804
Have you got the packet? - Yes.
- Open it.

613
01:29:49,761 --> 01:29:54,738
There is a bottle with a pin
& some powder in it.

614
01:29:54,773 --> 01:29:58,136
It is cyanide.
Cyanide?

615
01:29:58,171 --> 01:30:07,589
Just pierce the needle atop the
bottle on to the patient, & he...

616
01:30:07,624 --> 01:30:13,776
Impossible. I can't do it. I
will not kill anybody.

617
01:30:13,811 --> 01:30:19,928
You will certainly do this iob.
otherwise Bunty...

618
01:30:30,069 --> 01:30:34,177
What does he want? - He wants
me to give the cynide & kill him.

619
01:30:34,207 --> 01:30:39,584
If something happens to my
Bunty, I'll not forgive you.

620
01:30:39,619 --> 01:30:47,126
Kill him, but I want
my Bunty back.

621
01:31:26,992 --> 01:31:29,664
Where are you going?

622
01:32:18,777 --> 01:32:25,557
What is it? - Due to stress I
couldn't sleep.

623
01:32:25,592 --> 01:32:32,931
He has still not regained
consciousness.

624
01:32:37,463 --> 01:32:42,673
May I see him. - I cannot allow
you, but you may come with me.

625
01:32:46,705 --> 01:32:50,212
Sergeant, he wants to see the
patient. Let him in.

626
01:32:54,613 --> 01:33:01,860
You worry so much about my
son. God bless you.

627
01:34:12,458 --> 01:34:18,937
Kill him, but I want
my son back.

628
01:35:37,976 --> 01:35:43,020
I have no words for praise for
you. In such conditions one can...

629
01:35:43,082 --> 01:35:55,573
... do anything. you are a very
brave man. In public I'll...

630
01:35:55,608 --> 01:36:01,839
I'm not interested in fame or
name. I just want my son

631
01:36:01,867 --> 01:36:12,221
I can't take it any more. These
three days have been horrible.

632
01:36:12,378 --> 01:36:19,525
My wife keeps crying. For what?
Just because I tried to save a...

633
01:36:19,552 --> 01:36:23,693
... life. If this is the result of
doing good in this world, then...

634
01:36:23,722 --> 01:36:31,304
Control yourself. We are with
you. God willing we'll find a way

635
01:36:36,402 --> 01:36:43,382
The details of the card are now
known and their organisers.

636
01:36:43,442 --> 01:36:50,489
Press is Raymond press and its
organizers Students Welfare Soc.

637
01:36:54,820 --> 01:36:58,894
See I told you, we will find a
way. Go home and...

638
01:36:58,924 --> 01:37:02,097
... look after your wife.

639
01:37:22,481 --> 01:37:25,019
Your card?

640
01:37:27,186 --> 01:37:32,429
What? A torn card. - Excuse
me, my child must have torn it.

641
01:37:49,575 --> 01:37:52,914
Your card? - Sorry.

642
01:38:21,374 --> 01:38:26,417
Your card?
Our chairman, Kishan lal.

643
01:38:43,896 --> 01:38:49,941
Our country's famous singer,
Narendra Chanchal will entertain. .

644
01:38:50,002 --> 01:38:55,146
... you with his melodious voice.

645
01:39:06,785 --> 01:39:26,925
Friend, Love has overwhelmed
me and I am completely yours.

646
01:39:26,960 --> 01:40:10,192
By taking your name always,
I have become nameless.

647
01:40:10,349 --> 01:40:14,056
No, friend, we have found
nothing, sir.

648
01:40:24,630 --> 01:40:57,762
Everywhere I go, it is iust you.
And I am yours.

649
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:52,688
I am glad to inform you, that Mr
Kishan Lal by acceding to become

650
01:42:52,723 --> 01:42:59,444
... our chief guest, has honored
our society.

651
01:42:59,479 --> 01:43:06,165
I will now request him to say
a few words.

652
01:43:07,960 --> 01:43:15,508
Ladies & gentlemen, I am grateful
to you. You have organised such. .

653
01:43:15,543 --> 01:43:19,937
... a nice function, for which I
wish to thank you.

654
01:43:19,972 --> 01:43:34,067
I am proud that there are such
organisations in our country...

655
01:43:34,120 --> 01:43:40,747
... which support children,
particularly those who cannot...

656
01:43:40,782 --> 01:43:47,375
... afford their own education.
I am very thankful to you all.

657
01:43:47,466 --> 01:44:00,899
I wish we have similar schools,
I mean institutes, in all states.

658
01:44:00,934 --> 01:44:14,333
It is the same voice. He is the
bastard who has kidnapped Bantu

659
01:44:14,427 --> 01:44:18,501
You are accusing one of the
most respected & richest person

660
01:44:18,531 --> 01:44:21,499
... of this city. Take care!

661
01:44:21,534 --> 01:44:28,881
I am very sure it is him. He
speaks exactly this way

662
01:44:28,916 --> 01:44:31,079
Don't talk nonsense! I'll have
you evicted!

663
01:44:31,110 --> 01:44:37,055
Mr Yadav, what are you talking.
- Look, you are tense & excited.

664
01:44:37,090 --> 01:44:39,550
Listen to him once again.
Come here.

665
01:44:39,585 --> 01:44:49,371
Now i'll not take anymore of
your time, meaning, I'll take leave.

666
01:44:51,830 --> 01:44:57,608
Professor, whenever you need
anything, do remember me.

667
01:44:57,643 --> 01:45:05,184
I will not leave you, you bastard.

668
01:45:24,863 --> 01:45:29,739
He has lost his son, so he is
upset, I am sorry. Pardon him.

669
01:45:29,774 --> 01:45:33,510
You had so much trouble. Looks
as if he is a mad man.

670
01:45:33,545 --> 01:45:37,247
What is all this, I am not
understanding anything.

671
01:45:37,282 --> 01:45:46,861
He is a criminal. He is a crook.

672
01:45:49,921 --> 01:45:52,727
Just now somebody tried to kill
me and I have...

673
01:45:52,762 --> 01:45:56,832
... struck him in the thigh
with the knife.

674
01:45:56,862 --> 01:45:59,567
Mr Yadav, phone for you.

675
01:46:12,911 --> 01:46:15,482
Reporter Verma has regained
consciousness. Good.

676
01:46:15,517 --> 01:46:18,053
He is saying that Kishan Lal
is the culprit.

677
01:46:18,088 --> 01:46:21,585
What? Kishan Lal tried
to kill him?

678
01:46:21,620 --> 01:46:24,192
Kishan Lal is a very big
smuggler. Verma was trying...

679
01:46:24,227 --> 01:46:27,229
... to expose him.

680
01:49:50,896 --> 01:49:54,136
Move the train.
- But...

681
01:49:54,166 --> 01:49:57,907
No buts. get the train moving or
else I'll shoot you.

682
01:50:06,445 --> 01:50:09,617
Mr Yadav, he has gone in the
train, with my son.

683
01:50:22,761 --> 01:50:25,782
I agree you are all CID
people, but...

684
01:50:25,817 --> 01:50:28,632
Believe us, that man is very
dangerous.

685
01:50:28,667 --> 01:50:30,820
Because of him thousands can
lose their lives.

686
01:50:30,855 --> 01:50:32,973
Do what ever you want, but
stop that train.

687
01:50:38,811 --> 01:50:41,645
Drive the train faster.

688
01:50:41,680 --> 01:50:47,792
How can that be possible? - But
you at least try.

689
01:50:47,820 --> 01:50:52,529
No track is open. - This
is very urgent! Do something.

690
01:50:52,564 --> 01:50:56,766
I'll get No. 5 lane for Frontier
is very late.

691
01:50:56,801 --> 01:50:58,765
Hurry up.

692
01:51:28,527 --> 01:51:31,199
Halt the Frontier Mail for 10
minutes as track isn't available.

693
01:51:31,234 --> 01:51:33,934
Frontier Mail has iust left.

694
01:51:33,969 --> 01:51:36,871
Do something sir.

695
01:51:36,935 --> 01:51:39,740
The fast train on Platform 2.
Halt it there only.

696
01:51:56,588 --> 01:51:59,328
Faster!

697
01:52:32,658 --> 01:52:36,766
Bandra, there is a train coming
on Track 4. Let it go forward.

698
01:52:36,795 --> 01:52:41,004
How can that be possible? There
are no tracks vacant!

699
01:52:41,034 --> 01:52:45,776
We will contact Borivali SM and
ask them to stop Saurashtra Exp

700
01:52:45,811 --> 01:52:47,841
... to be halted before Borivali.

701
01:53:10,129 --> 01:53:12,629
Red Signal.

702
01:53:12,664 --> 01:53:16,305
I don't understand. If you want
to live, don't stop the train.

703
01:56:35,901 --> 01:56:38,006
Sergeant, catch him.

704
01:56:44,843 --> 01:56:47,181
Well done Amit. Any ammount of
praise will be inadequate.

705
01:56:47,216 --> 01:56:50,714
I have done whatever was
my duty.

706
01:56:50,749 --> 01:56:54,756
If everybody performs his duty
like you, then crime will be...

707
01:56:54,791 --> 01:56:59,190
... eliminated from all cities
and the country.

708
01:56:59,225 --> 01:57:03,466
All criminals, who are nameless
will be eliminated.
