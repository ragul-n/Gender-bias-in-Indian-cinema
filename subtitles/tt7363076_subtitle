1
00:02:45,721 --> 00:02:47,041
'Revenue is the backbone
of administration.'

2
00:02:47,761 --> 00:02:49,961
'The treasury is more important
to the state than its army'

3
00:02:50,801 --> 00:02:53,441
'since it's used for
the betterment of the people.'

4
00:02:53,521 --> 00:02:54,921
'The Arthashastra by Kautilya,
Part-8, Chapter 1.'

5
00:04:02,681 --> 00:04:05,161
So, there's a residence here.
Hence, the female faction is here.

6
00:04:06,161 --> 00:04:07,361
But still, that's good.
That's a blessing in disguise.

7
00:04:07,641 --> 00:04:09,361
At least, we arranged
for our daily activities.

8
00:04:09,401 --> 00:04:10,801
Who knows what
Patnaik might do?

9
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:12,761
But he told us
not to open the envelope.

10
00:04:15,481 --> 00:04:16,641
Sir..
- He's here.

11
00:04:16,721 --> 00:04:17,761
Keep the tea aside.

12
00:05:30,681 --> 00:05:33,081
Hello! The vehicles are out of
the department

13
00:05:33,481 --> 00:05:34,481
and are moving
towards the left.

14
00:05:34,841 --> 00:05:36,121
Confirm it from someone
on the way.

15
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:39,321
My experience says,
it is going to be Banaras.

16
00:06:07,081 --> 00:06:08,041
Sir.

17
00:06:08,521 --> 00:06:10,041
Sir, you're not allowed
to go inside without the shoes.

18
00:06:13,161 --> 00:06:14,841
Gandhi walked barefoot
for several years for us

19
00:06:14,881 --> 00:06:16,361
to get entry into clubs.

20
00:06:17,161 --> 00:06:18,441
And you're objecting me
for wearing sandals!

21
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:20,201
Sir, that's the rule here.

22
00:06:20,921 --> 00:06:22,961
I'm sorry, sir.
- Don't be sorry.

23
00:06:23,681 --> 00:06:25,961
If you're following the rules,
be proud.

24
00:06:27,801 --> 00:06:28,921
Mr. Amay!

25
00:06:29,921 --> 00:06:31,121
What happened, sir?

26
00:06:31,961 --> 00:06:33,361
The rules were being broken,
Mr. Bajaj.

27
00:06:34,081 --> 00:06:36,881
I wouldn't like it
and not let it happen either.

28
00:06:37,841 --> 00:06:38,881
No, sir.

29
00:06:39,761 --> 00:06:40,921
Who stopped him?

30
00:06:43,761 --> 00:06:44,681
The influential people

31
00:06:44,721 --> 00:06:45,721
have stopped the poor people
once again.

32
00:06:45,961 --> 00:06:47,681
No problem.
Better luck next time.

33
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,241
No, sir,
it was me who invited you.

34
00:06:50,481 --> 00:06:51,521
How can you go back?

35
00:06:51,681 --> 00:06:54,681
Mr. Bajaj, I'm not coming inside
with these sandals on.

36
00:06:55,241 --> 00:06:57,161
And my house is too far,
I can't change my footwear.

37
00:06:57,881 --> 00:06:58,961
Please don't force me.

38
00:06:59,201 --> 00:07:00,641
But my shop is nearby.

39
00:06:59,201 --> 00:07:00,641
But my shop is nearby.

40
00:07:01,161 --> 00:07:02,281
I'll ask someone
to get a pair for you.

41
00:07:03,001 --> 00:07:05,041
Please don't insult me.

42
00:07:09,841 --> 00:07:12,361
What are you doing, sir?
It's a gift.

43
00:07:12,961 --> 00:07:16,121
For a government servant,
a gift means a bribe, Mr. Bajaj.

44
00:07:16,481 --> 00:07:18,361
No.. You will have to accept it.

45
00:07:18,681 --> 00:07:19,721
Please.

46
00:07:20,001 --> 00:07:22,681
If I took gifts,
I wouldn't have come

47
00:07:22,721 --> 00:07:24,321
to Lucknow with all my furniture
in a tempo.

48
00:07:24,961 --> 00:07:27,081
Okay, at least accept
the cost price.

49
00:07:27,441 --> 00:07:28,761
I can, at least, afford Rs.21.

50
00:07:29,641 --> 00:07:31,321
You're putting me
in a dilemma.

51
00:07:31,681 --> 00:07:33,721
Take it, Bajaj, come on.

52
00:07:35,641 --> 00:07:38,041
Pal, it's money earned honestly.

53
00:07:39,081 --> 00:07:41,521
You may not ever get it.

54
00:07:43,321 --> 00:07:45,561
Is there a dearth of honest
people in the city?

55
00:07:46,441 --> 00:07:51,081
No, there are many
but I never come across any.

56
00:07:52,961 --> 00:07:55,281
Okay, I'll see you often.

57
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:00,121
Mr. Patnaik,
he's Mr. Rameshwar

58
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:00,121
Mr. Patnaik,
he's Mr. Rameshwar

59
00:08:01,241 --> 00:08:02,561
the city's biggest..

60
00:08:02,601 --> 00:08:04,161
Landlord, contractor,
businessman

61
00:08:04,201 --> 00:08:05,241
and the most powerful man.

62
00:08:05,281 --> 00:08:06,401
He has been an MP
three times

63
00:08:07,241 --> 00:08:08,641
and has the support of 51 MLAs.

64
00:08:09,961 --> 00:08:11,481
He loves to read newspapers
and magazines.

65
00:08:12,281 --> 00:08:13,841
You don't have to give
me any information.

66
00:08:15,681 --> 00:08:16,721
Take it.

67
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:19,361
For the first time, a government
officer is giving

68
00:08:19,681 --> 00:08:20,721
and not taking something.

69
00:08:22,281 --> 00:08:24,561
Come on,
enough of the chat now.

70
00:08:25,281 --> 00:08:28,281
Get us something to drink
and welcome him.

71
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:36,481
Mr. Amay.

72
00:08:37,241 --> 00:08:38,401
What are you doing?

73
00:08:38,681 --> 00:08:40,841
I've made a special
arrangement for you.

74
00:08:42,601 --> 00:08:44,201
I only drink the brand
I can afford.

75
00:08:51,961 --> 00:08:53,001
Cheers!

76
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,361
Cheers!
- Cheers!

77
00:09:04,641 --> 00:09:06,121
You set up everything so soon.

78
00:09:07,201 --> 00:09:08,921
We don't have much
for me to take long.

79
00:09:11,281 --> 00:09:12,961
My parents had shown
me big dreams.

80
00:09:13,521 --> 00:09:14,601
They said that I'll
be getting married

81
00:09:14,641 --> 00:09:15,681
to an income tax officer.

82
00:09:15,881 --> 00:09:17,721
That too with a search
and seizure wing officer.

83
00:09:18,281 --> 00:09:19,401
I would be..

84
00:09:19,561 --> 00:09:20,561
Are you regretting?

85
00:09:20,641 --> 00:09:23,321
Yes, not because of the house
that's half-full.

86
00:09:23,881 --> 00:09:25,161
Because of the missing husband

87
00:09:25,721 --> 00:09:27,281
who drinks rum with others.

88
00:09:28,441 --> 00:09:29,961
He doesn't want to stay home
and have something else.

89
00:09:31,281 --> 00:09:32,521
That's a good idea.

90
00:09:33,361 --> 00:09:34,601
You smell of rum.

91
00:09:34,961 --> 00:09:36,081
Is that the same horse brand?

92
00:09:36,441 --> 00:09:37,601
Of course.

93
00:09:37,921 --> 00:09:39,361
Would your husband
drink a donkey brand?

94
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,401
And as far as the smell
is concerned

95
00:09:43,321 --> 00:09:44,481
what did the British invent

96
00:09:44,521 --> 00:09:45,521
the toothbrush
and toothpaste for?

97
00:09:46,121 --> 00:09:47,801
Did the British invent
toothbrushes and toothpastes?

98
00:09:48,281 --> 00:09:49,521
They would never drink.

99
00:09:55,401 --> 00:09:56,441
Cardamom?

100
00:09:56,481 --> 00:09:57,961
The British have
invented nothing!

101
00:09:58,601 --> 00:10:00,041
Everything was invented
by us Indians.

102
00:09:58,601 --> 00:10:00,041
Everything was invented
by us Indians.

103
00:10:00,681 --> 00:10:02,321
Even the..

104
00:10:02,721 --> 00:10:03,961
I can prove it.

105
00:10:07,681 --> 00:10:08,921
Then prove it.

106
00:10:18,121 --> 00:10:21,881
"Even my eyes start smiling
when I look at you."

107
00:10:22,081 --> 00:10:25,801
"I feel that you are closer
to me than my own life."

108
00:10:29,721 --> 00:10:33,481
"To these empty hands of mine,
you are God's benevolence."

109
00:10:33,601 --> 00:10:37,281
"There can never be
anyone like you."

110
00:10:37,481 --> 00:10:41,321
"For me to pray, oh, partner,
even your door is sufficient."

111
00:10:41,481 --> 00:10:45,641
"I don't need any God but you."

112
00:10:46,401 --> 00:10:48,081
"I ask for your well-being."

113
00:10:48,161 --> 00:10:51,441
"I ask for your well-being,
my beloved."

114
00:10:51,601 --> 00:10:54,961
"I pray for nothing else."

115
00:10:55,441 --> 00:10:58,041
"I pray for nothing else."

116
00:10:58,081 --> 00:11:01,161
"I ask for your well-being,
my beloved."

117
00:10:58,081 --> 00:11:01,161
"I ask for your well-being,
my beloved."

118
00:11:01,281 --> 00:11:04,841
"I pray for nothing else."

119
00:11:05,161 --> 00:11:07,761
"I pray for nothing else."

120
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:09,361
Ma'am, it's your first Sunday
in Lucknow.

121
00:11:09,761 --> 00:11:11,321
Tell me,
where should I take you to?

122
00:11:11,481 --> 00:11:14,081
PAC headquarters and then,
straight to the government hospital.

123
00:11:15,881 --> 00:11:17,401
Come on,
these are useful places.

124
00:11:17,441 --> 00:11:19,001
Let's go and check them out.
- Okay.

125
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:19,921
'35th Battalion, PAC, Lucknow.'

126
00:11:19,961 --> 00:11:21,801
Mr. Patnaik at least
took out some time to meet me.

127
00:11:23,121 --> 00:11:25,321
Otherwise, he never has time
to meet anyone.

128
00:11:26,761 --> 00:11:28,121
He gets bored easily

129
00:11:28,561 --> 00:11:29,801
that's why he doesn't stay
at one place for too long.

130
00:11:31,681 --> 00:11:35,401
"I was scattered
like broken glass."

131
00:11:35,681 --> 00:11:39,561
"I got a new lease of life
when you touched me."

132
00:11:43,401 --> 00:11:47,201
"I don't count that time
as age"

133
00:11:47,241 --> 00:11:51,041
"which I spent without you."

134
00:11:51,081 --> 00:11:54,881
"No other colour appeals to me"

135
00:11:54,921 --> 00:11:59,721
"ever since I got drenched
in the colour of your love."

136
00:11:59,921 --> 00:12:01,601
"I ask for your well-being."

137
00:11:59,921 --> 00:12:01,601
"I ask for your well-being."

138
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:05,041
"I ask for your well-being,
my beloved."

139
00:12:05,201 --> 00:12:06,601
"I pray for nothing.."

140
00:12:07,161 --> 00:12:10,961
"I pray for nothing else."

141
00:12:23,961 --> 00:12:27,161
Sir, I'm Lallan Sudheer,
Senior Assistant, Income Tax.

142
00:12:27,201 --> 00:12:29,481
She is Ms. Mukta Yadav,
Assistant, Income Tax.

143
00:12:29,521 --> 00:12:30,881
And he is Satish Mishra.
- Greetings.

144
00:12:30,921 --> 00:12:32,521
He has recently joined
as an Inspector.

145
00:12:33,121 --> 00:12:34,121
Please have a seat.

146
00:12:36,761 --> 00:12:38,281
The assessees are
increasing in number.

147
00:12:39,241 --> 00:12:41,361
But there is not much
improvement in tax collection.

148
00:12:41,921 --> 00:12:43,041
Because only the government
officials

149
00:12:43,081 --> 00:12:44,601
and private sector employees
are paying the tax

150
00:12:44,961 --> 00:12:45,961
which, obviously,
are just a handful.

151
00:12:46,401 --> 00:12:47,481
Exactly.

152
00:12:48,481 --> 00:12:49,921
We will have to carry out raids
after thorough survey

153
00:12:49,921 --> 00:12:50,961
and investigation.

154
00:12:51,241 --> 00:12:52,481
This will be a warning for them

155
00:12:53,761 --> 00:12:56,001
that the department will
not accept tax evasion anymore.

156
00:12:58,601 --> 00:12:59,841
Carry on. See you.

157
00:13:01,641 --> 00:13:04,521
Don't worry.
He's new, hence the passion!

158
00:13:04,601 --> 00:13:05,761
There will be some noise, right?

159
00:13:16,361 --> 00:13:17,561
Do you read magazines,
Lallan?

160
00:13:17,801 --> 00:13:19,441
Sir, I don't know English
that well.

161
00:13:20,961 --> 00:13:22,241
This is in Hindi.

162
00:13:22,281 --> 00:13:23,721
'The era of dharma.'

163
00:13:24,561 --> 00:13:25,561
This story is about me
and an IAS officer

164
00:13:25,601 --> 00:13:27,241
written two months ago.

165
00:13:28,081 --> 00:13:30,281
Look, there's also a photo
of ours on the cover page.

166
00:13:32,001 --> 00:13:34,281
I have been transferred
49 times in seven years.

167
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:38,081
As long as I don't get
transferred another time

168
00:13:39,881 --> 00:13:41,361
get used to the noise.

169
00:13:56,801 --> 00:13:58,001
Greeting, Mr. Bhargav.

170
00:13:59,161 --> 00:14:00,201
Come, Lallan.

171
00:13:59,161 --> 00:14:00,201
Come, Lallan.

172
00:14:00,961 --> 00:14:02,001
What's the news?

173
00:14:02,081 --> 00:14:03,361
It's bad but it can be avoided.

174
00:14:05,281 --> 00:14:07,241
What do you mean?
- The raid season is coming, sir.

175
00:14:07,321 --> 00:14:09,121
A lot of your clients
could be affected.

176
00:14:10,121 --> 00:14:12,321
You can at least, alert us
before the raid, right?

177
00:14:12,361 --> 00:14:13,681
Yes, that would cost you
some money.

178
00:14:13,721 --> 00:14:15,321
Fifty, right now and fifty later.

179
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:16,801
Come on, Lallan!

180
00:14:16,921 --> 00:14:18,681
Inflation is sky high, Mr. Bhargav.

181
00:14:18,721 --> 00:14:20,041
What can I do in this?

182
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:35,121
Hello.

183
00:14:35,321 --> 00:14:36,481
'Amay Patnaik?'

184
00:14:37,081 --> 00:14:38,721
Yes, tell me.
This is Amay Patnaik speaking.

185
00:14:39,321 --> 00:14:40,401
Who's speaking?

186
00:14:52,241 --> 00:14:54,841
Hello. - 'I have some information
on tax evasion.'

187
00:14:55,521 --> 00:14:56,401
Who has called?

188
00:14:57,121 --> 00:14:58,081
Come to the office tomorrow.

189
00:14:58,521 --> 00:14:59,561
'I can't come to your office.'

190
00:15:00,881 --> 00:15:01,841
I understood.

191
00:15:02,481 --> 00:15:03,321
Can you meet somewhere outside?

192
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:04,321
'You have to meet me right now.'

193
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:06,681
Right now?
Isn't it quite late in the night?

194
00:15:08,201 --> 00:15:09,001
'If you want the information'

195
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:09,921
'you have
to meet right now.'

196
00:15:09,961 --> 00:15:11,281
'Meet me at the Temple
of Goddess Chandrika.'

197
00:15:20,681 --> 00:15:21,761
I will be back in some time.

198
00:15:21,801 --> 00:15:22,641
Where are you going?

199
00:15:22,681 --> 00:15:24,081
Where are you going,
so late in the night?

200
00:15:24,121 --> 00:15:25,001
I am going to the temple.

201
00:15:25,641 --> 00:15:26,801
But you are an atheist.

202
00:15:27,001 --> 00:15:28,401
You believe in your motherland.

203
00:15:28,881 --> 00:15:30,201
I am going for Her sake.

204
00:15:44,641 --> 00:15:45,841
Join the queue for the entrance
to the temple.

205
00:16:12,081 --> 00:16:13,281
'Some names are written here.'

206
00:16:13,361 --> 00:16:15,161
'Get their details from your office.'

207
00:16:15,561 --> 00:16:19,121
'Rakesh Singh.
Area, Lucknow. N53, 1.'

208
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:20,481
'Assessment year.'

209
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:23,001
'78-79, 79-80.'

210
00:16:23,081 --> 00:16:24,201
'81.'

211
00:16:24,241 --> 00:16:26,281
'Suraj Singh, Lucknow. 53..'

212
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:28,441
'Assessment period.. 79.'

213
00:16:28,481 --> 00:16:30,721
'80-81..'

214
00:16:46,361 --> 00:16:47,921
I guess you have found someone.

215
00:16:48,881 --> 00:16:50,601
That's why you are ignoring me
and you are engrossed in work.

216
00:16:52,361 --> 00:16:54,241
Who is it? A prominent figure?

217
00:16:54,641 --> 00:16:55,601
No.

218
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:57,521
Routine office work.

219
00:16:58,561 --> 00:17:00,041
When the routine changes,
the wife is the first person

220
00:16:58,561 --> 00:17:00,041
When the routine changes,
the wife is the first person

221
00:17:00,081 --> 00:17:01,241
to understand it.

222
00:17:05,521 --> 00:17:06,761
I can't tell you about it.

223
00:17:08,481 --> 00:17:09,641
Don't you even trust me?

224
00:17:13,801 --> 00:17:14,801
I trust you more than my life

225
00:17:15,841 --> 00:17:16,841
but rules are rules.

226
00:17:17,641 --> 00:17:19,201
Like an ordinary civilian

227
00:17:19,281 --> 00:17:20,561
you will either read about it
in the newspaper

228
00:17:21,001 --> 00:17:22,241
or you will watch it
on television.

229
00:17:24,721 --> 00:17:25,881
Just because I am jovial
all the time

230
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:28,721
doesn't mean that your honesty
doesn't scare me.

231
00:17:30,121 --> 00:17:31,721
At times, even I am afraid of it.

232
00:17:32,161 --> 00:17:33,841
Then why are you such
an honest officer, Amay?

233
00:17:34,441 --> 00:17:35,881
Every two months,
you get transferred.

234
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:37,641
I would have to pack,
relocate, decorate the house

235
00:17:37,721 --> 00:17:39,361
then dismantle everything
and repeat the process.

236
00:17:39,921 --> 00:17:40,801
I am tired of all this.

237
00:17:41,081 --> 00:17:41,921
Are you not tired of it?

238
00:17:44,961 --> 00:17:46,641
Did you study 'Namak Ka Daroga'
in school?

239
00:17:47,561 --> 00:17:48,721
It's written by Munshi Premchand.

240
00:17:48,761 --> 00:17:49,601
Everyone has studied it.

241
00:17:49,641 --> 00:17:51,001
It was in my 10th standard syllabus.

242
00:17:51,241 --> 00:17:52,161
What's your point?

243
00:17:52,401 --> 00:17:53,441
Point.

244
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:55,641
The salt inspector in that story

245
00:17:56,401 --> 00:17:58,361
didn't even take
an oath of honesty.

246
00:17:58,601 --> 00:18:01,721
We take an oath
when we join our department.

247
00:17:58,601 --> 00:18:01,721
We take an oath
when we join our department.

248
00:18:03,961 --> 00:18:05,361
A person who can't keep his word

249
00:18:06,321 --> 00:18:07,321
is worthless.

250
00:18:09,481 --> 00:18:10,361
What makes a human being
different from an animal

251
00:18:10,401 --> 00:18:13,081
is the former's ability
to keep his word.

252
00:18:13,841 --> 00:18:15,001
A human being can keep his word

253
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:18,001
but an animal can't.

254
00:18:55,681 --> 00:18:57,401
'Buy peanuts from the man
wearing a blue shirt'

255
00:18:57,481 --> 00:18:58,761
'at the hardinge bridge.'

256
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:10,041
'You must've learnt
what is there in the records.'

257
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:13,121
'There are innumerable
illegal businesses.'

258
00:20:33,881 --> 00:20:35,721
Hello.
- 'Do you believe me now?'

259
00:20:39,721 --> 00:20:41,521
Yes, so far, you have provided
the right information.

260
00:20:41,881 --> 00:20:43,721
I have seen more assets
than income.

261
00:20:45,001 --> 00:20:47,441
The files prove that taxes
haven't been paid.

262
00:20:48,961 --> 00:20:52,761
You still haven't told me
where all the black money is.

263
00:20:53,241 --> 00:20:54,401
'Raid his house.'

264
00:20:54,801 --> 00:20:56,641
'You will get all
the information there.'

265
00:20:57,841 --> 00:20:59,521
How can I believe this
to be true blindly?

266
00:20:59,921 --> 00:21:01,481
This is a major raid
and an important one.

267
00:20:59,921 --> 00:21:01,481
This is a major raid
and an important one.

268
00:21:01,881 --> 00:21:03,321
And where are the
secrets buried..

269
00:21:03,361 --> 00:21:04,521
Do you expect me to believe

270
00:21:04,961 --> 00:21:05,841
I will get this crucial
information

271
00:21:05,881 --> 00:21:06,761
when I raid the house?

272
00:21:07,881 --> 00:21:09,121
I can't take this risk.

273
00:21:09,561 --> 00:21:10,681
'Why? Did you get scared?'

274
00:21:11,281 --> 00:21:13,641
Look, I am not afraid of anyone.

275
00:21:14,361 --> 00:21:16,921
I have the courage
to knock on anyone's door.

276
00:21:18,721 --> 00:21:19,721
Hello?

277
00:21:38,561 --> 00:21:40,241
My mind says
that I should wait

278
00:21:40,281 --> 00:21:41,481
till I find solid evidence.

279
00:21:42,961 --> 00:21:44,961
My heart says if I don't
act brave

280
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:47,641
later,
I won't find any evidence.

281
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:51,081
What do you suggest?

282
00:21:53,401 --> 00:21:54,601
You keep calling me
your love

283
00:21:54,841 --> 00:21:55,841
and you say I reside
in your heart.

284
00:21:56,761 --> 00:21:57,961
Then, what would I say?

285
00:21:57,961 --> 00:21:59,161
'Smoking is injurious
to health.'

286
00:22:00,961 --> 00:22:02,321
Officers of India
don't need to be brave.

287
00:22:04,321 --> 00:22:06,081
Their wives need to.

288
00:22:08,001 --> 00:22:09,081
Thank you, Malini.

289
00:22:21,601 --> 00:22:22,681
So far, there hasn't been
any raid

290
00:22:22,721 --> 00:22:24,041
which has led to
such a great recovery.

291
00:22:24,721 --> 00:22:26,081
The department will be praised.

292
00:22:26,961 --> 00:22:28,641
You will also be praised
just before your retirement.

293
00:22:31,921 --> 00:22:33,001
I will be praised?

294
00:22:34,161 --> 00:22:35,321
What will you get?

295
00:22:37,001 --> 00:22:38,201
What I always do.

296
00:22:38,801 --> 00:22:39,921
A transfer.

297
00:22:40,241 --> 00:22:41,361
Anyway.

298
00:22:41,961 --> 00:22:44,481
I am signing on the
satisfaction letter.

299
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,281
Amay, do you know
who you are about to attack?

300
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:54,281
If you don't find
anything over there

301
00:22:54,361 --> 00:22:56,681
the first thing he will break,
is the law.

302
00:22:57,841 --> 00:22:58,961
You have to be very careful.

303
00:23:00,041 --> 00:23:02,361
We can't believe the local police.

304
00:23:03,721 --> 00:23:05,801
Take heavy protection
from the PAC.

305
00:23:07,081 --> 00:23:08,121
Yes, sir. I will.

306
00:23:08,241 --> 00:23:11,441
Even then, you'll be responsible
for your officers' safety.

307
00:23:11,601 --> 00:23:14,161
Yes, sir.
I guarantee you their safety.

308
00:23:15,641 --> 00:23:20,401
He can sue you if you fail to get

309
00:23:21,001 --> 00:23:22,721
a recovery amount around this figure.

310
00:23:24,801 --> 00:23:26,361
A departmental enquiry could
be initiated against you.

311
00:23:29,361 --> 00:23:31,561
Sir, I'll get the recovery
nearing this figure.

312
00:23:32,001 --> 00:23:32,961
All the best.

313
00:23:35,761 --> 00:23:37,401
Take care of yourself
and your team.

314
00:23:37,561 --> 00:23:38,681
Yes, sir. Thank you.

315
00:23:46,441 --> 00:23:48,761
You all will report to office
at 5:15 a.m.

316
00:23:49,601 --> 00:23:51,041
You will find the details
on the notice board

317
00:23:51,081 --> 00:23:52,641
giving out area-wise details
about which team will conduct

318
00:23:53,161 --> 00:23:55,441
the search and seize operations,
when and where.

319
00:23:55,761 --> 00:23:56,881
And you'll get the names
of the assessees

320
00:23:57,321 --> 00:23:59,081
in sealed envelopes.

321
00:24:00,081 --> 00:24:03,481
But I will say when to
open those, on the way.

322
00:24:04,241 --> 00:24:08,761
Where would I..
I mean, my team, raid, sir?

323
00:24:10,881 --> 00:24:12,601
Why are you getting so desperate?

324
00:24:14,281 --> 00:24:16,241
Everyone will get
the sealed envelopes

325
00:24:17,321 --> 00:24:18,401
tomorrow, in the morning.

326
00:24:24,361 --> 00:24:25,961
Good night.
- Good night. Bye, sir.

327
00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:26,921
Good night.

328
00:24:27,041 --> 00:24:30,881
These papers are..
- Which papers.. - Sir..

329
00:24:43,921 --> 00:24:44,921
Hello, Mr. Yogi.

330
00:24:44,961 --> 00:24:45,961
Hello, Mr. Bhargav.

331
00:24:46,001 --> 00:24:48,201
Listen, Mr. Sinha.
The panic button is pressed.

332
00:24:48,241 --> 00:24:49,721
There will be raids
early in the morning.

333
00:24:49,761 --> 00:24:50,841
Brace yourself.

334
00:24:50,881 --> 00:24:52,881
He didn't let anyone
learn about it.

335
00:24:53,521 --> 00:24:56,041
He just announced it.
Everyone was clueless.

336
00:25:13,881 --> 00:25:14,841
It's strong.

337
00:25:21,681 --> 00:25:22,761
Like my wife?

338
00:25:24,841 --> 00:25:26,081
Will you give it tomorrow?

339
00:25:28,081 --> 00:25:29,321
I can't promise that.

340
00:25:30,761 --> 00:25:32,201
But I'll make you drink it
when I return. That's a promise.

341
00:25:34,961 --> 00:25:36,201
I will wait.

342
00:25:37,041 --> 00:25:38,081
Like always.

343
00:25:39,201 --> 00:25:40,321
Because my husband
is never interested

344
00:25:40,361 --> 00:25:41,561
in trivial raids.

345
00:25:43,281 --> 00:25:46,801
You always take risks
and get me tense.

346
00:26:04,201 --> 00:26:05,961
The vehicles have taken
a left turn from the department.

347
00:26:06,281 --> 00:26:08,761
As per my experience,
the raid will be at Banaras.

348
00:26:08,801 --> 00:26:10,081
Take a left turn from there.

349
00:26:10,161 --> 00:26:12,641
We're going to Sitagarh
not Banaras.

350
00:26:14,201 --> 00:26:17,361
We are not going to Banaras.
That was a plan to fool the moles.

351
00:26:17,841 --> 00:26:18,801
Open your envelopes.

352
00:26:19,361 --> 00:26:22,401
Should we really open the envelope?
Mister, can you see

353
00:26:22,441 --> 00:26:23,521
what I can see there?

354
00:26:23,601 --> 00:26:24,481
What?

355
00:26:24,881 --> 00:26:25,721
White House?

356
00:26:25,801 --> 00:26:29,081
There are black clouds of danger.
You won't understand.

357
00:26:29,841 --> 00:26:30,721
Stop the car.

358
00:26:31,641 --> 00:26:32,601
I say, stop the car.

359
00:26:32,681 --> 00:26:33,761
But what happened?

360
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:36,801
Hey, listen.

361
00:26:38,681 --> 00:26:40,161
What happened, pal?
Why did he get down?

362
00:26:40,201 --> 00:26:41,561
I don't want to go.
You may go ahead.

363
00:26:41,841 --> 00:26:42,761
What's the problem?

364
00:26:43,481 --> 00:26:45,641
Sir, if the raid is to be conducted
on the White House

365
00:26:45,681 --> 00:26:46,921
I won't participate in it.
- Why?

366
00:26:47,361 --> 00:26:50,201
We are from the same village.
He's our messiah.

367
00:26:50,721 --> 00:26:53,161
He got me educated. He's
given a job to my brother too.

368
00:26:53,401 --> 00:26:56,201
If he learns about it,
he'll kill me and my family.

369
00:26:58,361 --> 00:27:00,401
Being a government officer,
you shouldn't behave this way.

370
00:26:58,361 --> 00:27:00,401
Being a government officer,
you shouldn't behave this way.

371
00:27:00,721 --> 00:27:01,921
Everyone is scared of dying,
sir.

372
00:27:03,441 --> 00:27:05,121
You may suspend me from duty

373
00:27:05,881 --> 00:27:07,121
but I won't go for the raid.

374
00:27:07,761 --> 00:27:12,121
Satish,
draft his dismissal order

375
00:27:12,561 --> 00:27:15,401
and keep him in the headquarters
with two PAC constables

376
00:27:16,081 --> 00:27:17,481
till the raid is over.

377
00:27:17,521 --> 00:27:18,561
Sir..
- Yes, sir.

378
00:27:19,041 --> 00:27:20,041
PAC?

379
00:27:32,561 --> 00:27:34,281
We have a warrant
for Rameshwar Singh.

380
00:27:34,761 --> 00:27:35,761
A search warrant.

381
00:27:36,601 --> 00:27:38,201
Why are you joking, sir?

382
00:27:39,161 --> 00:27:40,841
I never joke so early
in the day.

383
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:42,081
Open the gate.

384
00:27:43,081 --> 00:27:44,241
Take a look inside.

385
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:52,041
Take a look outside.

386
00:28:12,921 --> 00:28:16,401
I need a cup of tea to
get rid of drowsiness.

387
00:28:19,321 --> 00:28:24,081
Let me get rid of this
drowsiness and I will talk.

388
00:28:29,801 --> 00:28:30,961
Do you realise that
you are misbehaving

389
00:28:31,041 --> 00:28:33,521
with a government officer?

390
00:28:34,681 --> 00:28:39,441
Are you behaving
properly with an MP?

391
00:28:41,121 --> 00:28:42,521
I am doing my duty.

392
00:28:45,961 --> 00:28:47,921
And I am doing my duty

393
00:28:51,241 --> 00:28:53,441
by making you realise
your worth.

394
00:28:56,001 --> 00:28:59,241
I should have done it
the very first day

395
00:28:59,881 --> 00:29:01,441
when we met first.

396
00:28:59,881 --> 00:29:01,441
when we met first.

397
00:29:03,801 --> 00:29:08,521
No officer can dare
to enter this house

398
00:29:08,561 --> 00:29:10,961
and you've come here
to conduct a raid!

399
00:29:15,801 --> 00:29:17,161
Here is the
search and seizure warrant.

400
00:29:23,961 --> 00:29:25,161
Read it out.

401
00:29:29,241 --> 00:29:34,041
My friend, I can't read or write.

402
00:29:34,921 --> 00:29:36,121
Read it out.

403
00:29:37,481 --> 00:29:38,961
I have already told you
everything.

404
00:29:40,121 --> 00:29:41,681
And you know everything by now.

405
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:43,521
Mr. Rameshwar Singh.

406
00:29:46,841 --> 00:29:50,321
I am on duty. I can't call you
by your fond name.

407
00:29:51,161 --> 00:29:53,801
That's fine.

408
00:29:56,041 --> 00:29:58,961
You can check our identity cards
before we enter.

409
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:02,521
And you can also examine us

410
00:30:03,721 --> 00:30:06,481
so that no one can say that
we have planted anything.

411
00:30:08,921 --> 00:30:11,961
Bheeku, examine them.

412
00:30:14,041 --> 00:30:17,081
Examine all of them,
except the women.

413
00:30:19,761 --> 00:30:22,281
You can call two honest
witnesses of your choice.

414
00:30:24,921 --> 00:30:29,401
Everyone except you loves me

415
00:30:29,441 --> 00:30:30,641
in this area.

416
00:30:31,041 --> 00:30:32,441
Call anyone of your choice.

417
00:30:33,841 --> 00:30:35,401
Inspector.
- Yes, sir.

418
00:30:35,521 --> 00:30:37,681
Call Mr. Vijay Shrivastava,
Principal of J K College

419
00:30:38,481 --> 00:30:41,681
and Mr. Mithiliesh Mani, Head Master
of the Secondary School.

420
00:30:41,721 --> 00:30:42,601
Yes, sir.

421
00:30:43,121 --> 00:30:44,121
Mukta.

422
00:30:46,321 --> 00:30:47,161
Yes, sir?

423
00:30:47,281 --> 00:30:50,161
You all go inside
and gather everyone.

424
00:30:51,201 --> 00:30:53,041
Call us inside when
the women in this house

425
00:30:53,921 --> 00:30:55,121
are fine with us
being present inside.

426
00:30:55,441 --> 00:30:56,721
Fine, sir.

427
00:31:05,201 --> 00:31:07,921
Shall I tell you a secret,
Patnaik?

428
00:31:08,721 --> 00:31:10,121
I am a politician.

429
00:31:10,481 --> 00:31:12,641
I have circulated all the money.

430
00:31:13,721 --> 00:31:16,721
Go ahead and search.
You will find nothing.

431
00:31:17,921 --> 00:31:19,561
You'll leave empty-handed.

432
00:31:23,361 --> 00:31:24,961
I had left empty-handed
only from my in-laws' place

433
00:31:25,041 --> 00:31:26,321
on my wedding day.

434
00:31:27,721 --> 00:31:29,721
And I have come here
so early in the morning

435
00:31:30,561 --> 00:31:32,161
not to go back empty-handed.

436
00:31:33,681 --> 00:31:35,641
If you don't find anything

437
00:31:37,521 --> 00:31:41,801
you'll fall at my feet

438
00:31:41,881 --> 00:31:43,561
and apologise before everyone.

439
00:31:44,441 --> 00:31:45,761
Is it acceptable to you?

440
00:31:47,161 --> 00:31:51,041
You can't pose a challenge
to me, but I can accept it.

441
00:31:53,681 --> 00:31:54,921
I accept it.

442
00:31:57,721 --> 00:31:59,481
Sir, you may come in.

443
00:32:19,361 --> 00:32:20,761
Everyone should give
their introduction.

444
00:32:20,801 --> 00:32:22,321
Satish, note down
everyone's names.

445
00:32:22,921 --> 00:32:26,601
He is Rakesh Singh,
my younger brother.

446
00:32:26,681 --> 00:32:28,681
He is Anubhav Singh.
He is younger to him.

447
00:32:29,121 --> 00:32:31,801
She is Prabha, Rakesh's wife.

448
00:32:32,721 --> 00:32:35,321
She's Reema, Anubhav's wife.

449
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:38,641
He is Suraj Singh,
the youngest of us all.

450
00:32:38,921 --> 00:32:40,881
He is my son, Shashi.

451
00:32:41,561 --> 00:32:43,161
She's Tara, his wife.

452
00:32:44,361 --> 00:32:46,161
They are my sisters.

453
00:32:46,241 --> 00:32:49,561
I am Jaya. - Why are you
getting so impatient?

454
00:32:50,681 --> 00:32:52,521
I'm mentioning your name, right?
Sit down.

455
00:32:54,721 --> 00:32:58,401
Jaya and Sushma.
- What drama is this, Brother?

456
00:32:58,961 --> 00:33:00,241
Who are these guys?

457
00:32:58,961 --> 00:33:00,241
Who are these guys?

458
00:33:00,481 --> 00:33:01,961
He is Amay Patnaik.

459
00:33:02,721 --> 00:33:04,281
DC, Income Tax Department.

460
00:33:05,201 --> 00:33:07,361
He has gone crazy
after coming to Lucknow.

461
00:33:09,201 --> 00:33:12,361
This is your introduction,
right?

462
00:33:12,961 --> 00:33:14,841
Shall we introduce
even the kids?

463
00:33:15,561 --> 00:33:16,721
No.

464
00:33:17,081 --> 00:33:19,401
They are minors. You can send
them to school if you wish.

465
00:33:19,801 --> 00:33:23,041
But their bags will be checked
during their exit and entry.

466
00:33:23,401 --> 00:33:24,881
Do you want to search the kids?

467
00:33:25,281 --> 00:33:28,121
Pardon me.
The law requires us to do this.

468
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:32,681
Mr. Keeper of Law!
We will throw you

469
00:33:32,721 --> 00:33:34,921
and your simian army out.

470
00:33:40,201 --> 00:33:42,041
What do you think of yourself?

471
00:33:42,121 --> 00:33:43,521
Stop right there, Rakesh Singh.

472
00:33:44,801 --> 00:33:46,801
The punishment for manhandling
a government officer on duty

473
00:33:46,841 --> 00:33:48,201
is 7-year imprisonment.

474
00:33:49,081 --> 00:33:52,161
And if a government officer
slaps, the law won't give him

475
00:33:52,241 --> 00:33:53,481
any punishment.

476
00:33:54,601 --> 00:33:57,721
We won't ask you
your designation or department.

477
00:33:58,281 --> 00:34:00,761
But it's not right to come
to somebody's house and speak

478
00:33:58,281 --> 00:34:00,761
But it's not right to come
to somebody's house and speak

479
00:34:00,841 --> 00:34:03,201
in this manner, right?
- I am sorry.

480
00:34:04,561 --> 00:34:08,401
We will try
not to trouble any of you.

481
00:34:14,601 --> 00:34:19,361
Sir, this must be Mr. Ramu.
- What! How do you know?

482
00:34:19,401 --> 00:34:20,681
No. Well..

483
00:34:23,841 --> 00:34:26,161
God bless you.
Come, Srivastava.

484
00:34:27,561 --> 00:34:29,241
May victory be yours!
God bless you.

485
00:34:30,041 --> 00:34:31,961
They are falling at his feet.

486
00:34:32,041 --> 00:34:33,641
What harm can we cause him?

487
00:34:38,881 --> 00:34:41,801
What are you doing? - Let me
explain the rules to you all.

488
00:34:43,001 --> 00:34:44,801
You can't speak to anyone
over the phone.

489
00:34:44,881 --> 00:34:47,241
During the raid, you can't
step out of the house.

490
00:34:47,321 --> 00:34:48,881
No one can enter
the house either.

491
00:34:49,241 --> 00:34:51,521
The money and jewels
for which you have no accounts

492
00:34:52,281 --> 00:34:53,521
will be seized.

493
00:34:55,041 --> 00:34:56,481
But you will get
the receipt for that.

494
00:34:58,361 --> 00:35:02,481
And till this matter gets
solved, we'll leave

495
00:34:58,361 --> 00:35:02,481
And till this matter gets
solved, we'll leave

496
00:35:03,081 --> 00:35:04,721
some money behind, for your
household expenses.

497
00:35:07,201 --> 00:35:09,161
You won't get any receipt
for your documents.

498
00:35:09,401 --> 00:35:10,801
We will take them along with us.

499
00:35:11,401 --> 00:35:14,881
If any of you try to either burn
or tear the documents

500
00:35:15,241 --> 00:35:18,481
we will have to take the help
of police to stop you.

501
00:35:21,441 --> 00:35:23,081
We can even interrogate you.

502
00:35:24,441 --> 00:35:26,001
But the search and interrogation

503
00:35:26,161 --> 00:35:27,681
will be done
only during daytime.

504
00:35:27,841 --> 00:35:29,641
You have all the right
to rest at night.

505
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:32,201
You are talking
about staying back at night?

506
00:35:32,641 --> 00:35:33,961
Dad, send them away.

507
00:35:34,281 --> 00:35:35,721
There are women in the house.

508
00:35:36,161 --> 00:35:37,961
That's why the female officer
has accompanied us.

509
00:35:38,481 --> 00:35:39,801
Don't you worry.

510
00:35:40,041 --> 00:35:41,321
There won't be
any kind of misbehaviour.

511
00:35:41,401 --> 00:35:43,961
So, do we go to school or not?

512
00:35:44,081 --> 00:35:46,881
You won't become a DC like him
in a day.

513
00:35:46,961 --> 00:35:48,321
Stay at home for today.

514
00:35:48,761 --> 00:35:51,761
Brother, I will teach this guy..

515
00:35:51,881 --> 00:35:53,761
He is a crazy officer.

516
00:35:54,481 --> 00:35:55,841
Let him fulfil his desire.

517
00:35:56,481 --> 00:36:00,241
He will play for a while,
and he will get cheered up.

518
00:35:56,481 --> 00:36:00,241
He will play for a while,
and he will get cheered up.

519
00:36:01,401 --> 00:36:03,001
And then, I will play.

520
00:36:04,041 --> 00:36:07,801
You know, I never
feel bored of playing.

521
00:36:13,121 --> 00:36:16,521
Patnaik, the door is still open.

522
00:36:17,841 --> 00:36:21,601
You may leave as you came in.

523
00:36:39,441 --> 00:36:40,761
Let's begin.

524
00:37:02,041 --> 00:37:03,321
Check here.

525
00:37:03,961 --> 00:37:05,241
Check at the front.

526
00:37:10,681 --> 00:37:13,561
What did you say your name was?
- Reema. - Reema.

527
00:37:14,201 --> 00:37:16,521
By the way, your name
should have been 'Gehna'.

528
00:37:16,641 --> 00:37:17,681
Right?

529
00:37:18,281 --> 00:37:20,041
These are pretty, right?
- Yes.

530
00:37:20,161 --> 00:37:21,961
But they seem to be light.
- Light?

531
00:37:22,401 --> 00:37:25,121
It costs Rs. 1 lakh.
The bangle costs Rs. 75,000.

532
00:37:25,641 --> 00:37:27,281
Then you need to take them off.

533
00:37:40,601 --> 00:37:41,761
Check on top. Check every
single cloth. Check down there.

534
00:37:41,841 --> 00:37:43,681
What is it?
- Don't miss out on anything.

535
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:45,401
Mr. Rakesh,
I worry about your honour.

536
00:37:45,481 --> 00:37:47,761
If I get anything,
I will suppress it. Don't worry.

537
00:37:47,841 --> 00:37:49,881
Get lost!
Don't drive me crazy.

538
00:37:57,601 --> 00:37:58,961
Did you prepare mother-in-law's
breakfast? - Yes.

539
00:37:59,001 --> 00:38:00,121
Ma'am.

540
00:37:59,001 --> 00:38:00,121
Ma'am.

541
00:38:01,401 --> 00:38:03,081
Ma'am, I haven't come here
out of my own will.

542
00:38:03,161 --> 00:38:04,521
It's my job.
Tell me. What do I do?

543
00:38:07,721 --> 00:38:10,361
Ma'am..
I will surely get shot.

544
00:38:24,961 --> 00:38:26,441
We need to prepare a list.
We need to weigh.

545
00:38:26,521 --> 00:38:29,161
If you have paid the tax
for this, you can keep it.

546
00:38:29,201 --> 00:38:30,601
Let the nuptial chain be.

547
00:38:30,761 --> 00:38:31,921
What if I give you
the nuptial chain

548
00:38:31,961 --> 00:38:33,601
and retain the ring with me?

549
00:38:33,721 --> 00:38:35,761
Even this is a symbol of
a married woman, right?

550
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:37,601
Let me see.

551
00:38:38,241 --> 00:38:39,601
You have to take the ring off.

552
00:38:53,961 --> 00:38:55,561
Go towards the backside.
Did you find anything?

553
00:38:55,881 --> 00:38:57,041
There's nothing here.

554
00:38:57,161 --> 00:38:58,041
Are you happy now?

555
00:38:59,201 --> 00:39:00,041
You ruined my mattress.

556
00:38:59,201 --> 00:39:00,041
You ruined my mattress.

557
00:39:00,121 --> 00:39:00,961
I will make you buy
a new one for me.. - Come on..

558
00:39:01,041 --> 00:39:02,041
Got it?

559
00:39:07,241 --> 00:39:08,721
This is the tax return statement
for the last year.

560
00:39:09,161 --> 00:39:10,081
You may check it.

561
00:39:11,081 --> 00:39:13,881
Accounts of all the jewellery
are contained in it.

562
00:39:15,681 --> 00:39:16,841
Shall I wear it?

563
00:39:20,161 --> 00:39:21,241
Check minutely.

564
00:39:27,681 --> 00:39:29,041
Look over here and there as well.

565
00:39:30,161 --> 00:39:31,121
Check thoroughly.

566
00:39:31,881 --> 00:39:32,801
Over there as well.

567
00:39:46,401 --> 00:39:48,601
Sir, we checked everything
but didn't find anything.

568
00:39:53,321 --> 00:39:54,961
Sir, someone gave you
wrong information.

569
00:39:55,241 --> 00:39:56,361
We didn't find anything anywhere.

570
00:39:57,761 --> 00:39:58,681
Sir, we didn't find anything.

571
00:39:58,761 --> 00:40:01,201
Mr. Sinha, check it well.
- Sir.. - Okay.

572
00:39:58,761 --> 00:40:01,201
Mr. Sinha, check it well.
- Sir.. - Okay.

573
00:40:02,321 --> 00:40:04,241
Sir, these are the tax returns
for all the jewellery.

574
00:40:19,001 --> 00:40:19,961
I told you already!

575
00:40:20,481 --> 00:40:22,241
We searched everywhere
but didn't find anything.

576
00:40:22,401 --> 00:40:23,361
Let me talk to Mr. Amay.

577
00:40:27,521 --> 00:40:28,481
Sir..

578
00:40:29,281 --> 00:40:30,521
Sir, the second team member
is on the phone.

579
00:40:33,481 --> 00:40:35,681
Mr. Sinha?
- Sir, we didn't find anything.

580
00:40:36,201 --> 00:40:37,361
Shall we stop the raid?

581
00:40:40,961 --> 00:40:41,961
All right.

582
00:40:47,881 --> 00:40:49,521
Nothing seems to be found.

583
00:40:51,081 --> 00:40:52,961
All that has come out is sweat.

584
00:40:56,641 --> 00:40:59,481
It is worth it.

585
00:41:00,321 --> 00:41:02,161
A total of Rs. 420 crores
will come out.

586
00:41:04,081 --> 00:41:05,481
Better leave from here

587
00:41:06,761 --> 00:41:07,961
or I will approach the court

588
00:41:08,681 --> 00:41:10,321
and accuse you

589
00:41:10,921 --> 00:41:14,201
of taking bribe from the
opposition and raiding my house.

590
00:41:14,961 --> 00:41:16,441
Your reputation
will be tarnished

591
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:19,001
and you will lose your job.

592
00:41:19,601 --> 00:41:20,601
Got it?

593
00:41:28,961 --> 00:41:30,561
Shall I send some breakfast?

594
00:41:47,841 --> 00:41:49,081
Mr. Singh, please forgive me.

595
00:41:49,161 --> 00:41:51,281
I swear, I didn't want
to come to your house..

596
00:41:51,361 --> 00:41:52,441
Why will I come here?

597
00:41:52,521 --> 00:41:54,041
I just followed orders so..

598
00:41:54,121 --> 00:41:55,441
Thrash me with my shoe.

599
00:41:55,481 --> 00:41:57,081
Dear, what is your name?

600
00:41:57,161 --> 00:41:58,361
Lallan Sudheer.

601
00:41:58,441 --> 00:42:00,081
Dear, I heard what you said.

602
00:41:58,441 --> 00:42:00,081
Dear, I heard what you said.

603
00:42:01,361 --> 00:42:03,081
Can I relieve myself now?

604
00:42:03,481 --> 00:42:04,681
Sure.

605
00:42:24,281 --> 00:42:26,121
Hey, listen, get me some coal.

606
00:42:26,161 --> 00:42:27,161
I want to smoke this.

607
00:42:28,601 --> 00:42:30,121
What are you looking around for?

608
00:42:30,161 --> 00:42:31,481
I am asking you to get it.

609
00:42:32,681 --> 00:42:33,801
Who are you?

610
00:42:33,841 --> 00:42:35,841
Amay Patnaik.
- Amay Patnaik?

611
00:42:36,081 --> 00:42:37,121
I am from the
Income Tax department.

612
00:42:38,601 --> 00:42:39,641
I've come here to raid.

613
00:42:39,921 --> 00:42:41,481
Raid? For what?

614
00:42:41,721 --> 00:42:43,841
Black money.
- Black money?

615
00:42:44,401 --> 00:42:45,921
Does something called
black money even exist?

616
00:42:46,401 --> 00:42:49,081
Yes,
it does but I haven't found it yet.

617
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:51,721
I didn't see you since morning.

618
00:42:51,961 --> 00:42:53,681
I was in my room.

619
00:42:56,601 --> 00:42:58,521
What are you checking in my closet?

620
00:42:58,561 --> 00:42:59,441
Who are you?

621
00:42:59,721 --> 00:43:02,121
Rameshwar, Rakesh.. Listen..

622
00:42:59,721 --> 00:43:02,121
Rameshwar, Rakesh.. Listen..

623
00:43:02,441 --> 00:43:04,521
What are you doing with my closet?

624
00:43:05,521 --> 00:43:06,761
Who are you?

625
00:43:08,681 --> 00:43:10,961
Ma'am, where are the keys?

626
00:43:11,241 --> 00:43:12,801
I don't have any.

627
00:43:12,841 --> 00:43:13,681
Mom, what is the matter?

628
00:43:15,241 --> 00:43:16,321
You have crossed all limits.

629
00:43:16,521 --> 00:43:17,521
How can you enter
all the rooms like this?

630
00:43:17,961 --> 00:43:19,121
She is unwell.

631
00:43:19,321 --> 00:43:20,841
Leave her alone.

632
00:43:21,121 --> 00:43:23,761
Unwell? Who is unwell?

633
00:43:23,801 --> 00:43:24,801
Mom, you!

634
00:43:24,841 --> 00:43:26,121
I am not unwell.

635
00:43:26,401 --> 00:43:28,241
You are crossing all limits.

636
00:43:28,481 --> 00:43:30,161
Give me the keys for the safe.
- I don't know.

637
00:43:30,721 --> 00:43:33,201
She might have it.
- I don't have any key.

638
00:43:33,241 --> 00:43:35,361
If you don't, I'll have to
break it open.. - Well..

639
00:43:35,441 --> 00:43:37,321
Listen,
the keys are always with her.

640
00:43:37,361 --> 00:43:38,761
Mother-in-law, where are the keys?

641
00:43:38,801 --> 00:43:41,961
I have already told you
that I don't have it.

642
00:43:42,201 --> 00:43:44,441
Actually,
she keeps forgetting things

643
00:43:44,481 --> 00:43:45,481
and that's about it.

644
00:43:45,561 --> 00:43:47,401
I will have to break it open.
- Not at all.

645
00:43:48,121 --> 00:43:49,601
Mister, listen.

646
00:43:50,041 --> 00:43:52,001
Why are you troubling yourself?

647
00:43:53,641 --> 00:43:55,521
DC, this is your last day at work

648
00:43:55,921 --> 00:43:58,361
so go ahead and fulfil
this wish of yours, okay?

649
00:43:59,841 --> 00:44:00,961
Take it, come on.

650
00:43:59,841 --> 00:44:00,961
Take it, come on.

651
00:44:01,761 --> 00:44:03,961
Mom, I am hungry.

652
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:04,801
Let's go and eat something.

653
00:44:04,841 --> 00:44:06,401
I am not hungry.
- Bring her!

654
00:44:06,481 --> 00:44:08,161
I told you I am not hungry..
- Eat a little.. - Come on..

655
00:44:08,241 --> 00:44:10,321
Mom, I've grown old now..
- Don't act stubborn...

656
00:44:10,361 --> 00:44:12,281
Why are you hitting me?
- No.. - Get up. - Come on..

657
00:44:12,321 --> 00:44:13,601
Come on, please..
- Not at all..

658
00:44:13,681 --> 00:44:16,681
I don't want to eat.
- Mom, eat it..

659
00:44:16,721 --> 00:44:20,161
Well.. I've grown up now..
- Why are you.. - Hey!

660
00:44:25,961 --> 00:44:30,121
Brother, why are you still..
- Don't talk while eating.

661
00:44:36,001 --> 00:44:37,881
Brother, but..
- I just said it, right?

662
00:44:38,841 --> 00:44:40,841
Don't speak while eating.

663
00:44:45,281 --> 00:44:46,161
Come on, give me Jalebis.

664
00:44:47,201 --> 00:44:48,721
But you have diabetes..
- Didn't you hear me?

665
00:44:48,761 --> 00:44:51,081
No talking while eating.

666
00:45:13,441 --> 00:45:15,641
You have diabetes.

667
00:45:17,241 --> 00:45:19,321
Sir,
we didn't find anything.

668
00:45:19,361 --> 00:45:20,761
Only the temple area
is left to be checked.

669
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:22,281
What are you saying?

670
00:45:23,601 --> 00:45:25,521
So is the well.

671
00:45:27,001 --> 00:45:29,881
Go and jump into it.

672
00:45:32,241 --> 00:45:34,641
Lallan, get the pump.

673
00:45:46,361 --> 00:45:47,561
Hold it, come on..

674
00:45:49,201 --> 00:45:50,641
Come on, look inside..

675
00:45:52,881 --> 00:45:53,961
Take this.

676
00:45:55,761 --> 00:45:57,681
Hold this down..
- Hold it well. - Come on..

677
00:45:59,161 --> 00:46:00,081
Come on.

678
00:45:59,161 --> 00:46:00,081
Come on.

679
00:46:00,921 --> 00:46:02,081
Sir, I didn't find
anything down there.

680
00:46:06,321 --> 00:46:08,641
His body is already
drenched in mud.

681
00:46:09,961 --> 00:46:13,601
Your face will be smeared
with the same mud tomorrow.

682
00:46:19,761 --> 00:46:21,921
Sir,
your wife has arrived at the gate.

683
00:46:31,081 --> 00:46:32,121
I brought you food.

684
00:46:33,401 --> 00:46:34,561
How did you learn
that I was here?

685
00:46:35,281 --> 00:46:36,201
I am your wife

686
00:46:37,161 --> 00:46:38,841
so I know how to read information
from the files discreetly.

687
00:46:40,801 --> 00:46:42,961
Anyway, you will not eat
in this house, hence..

688
00:46:45,521 --> 00:46:46,641
But I am not alone.

689
00:46:46,881 --> 00:46:47,721
I have my entire team over here.

690
00:46:48,761 --> 00:46:50,401
Who said that I have brought
food just for you?

691
00:46:56,801 --> 00:46:57,961
You shouldn't have come here.

692
00:46:58,561 --> 00:46:59,721
Are you feeling scared for me?

693
00:47:00,961 --> 00:47:02,761
Now do you realise
how it affects me?

694
00:47:03,321 --> 00:47:04,881
Until you reach home,
I don't feel at peace.

695
00:47:05,201 --> 00:47:06,921
You will be here,
in the face of danger.

696
00:47:08,241 --> 00:47:09,641
How can you ask me to leave?

697
00:47:10,121 --> 00:47:12,881
Sir, please come here for a moment.
It's urgent!

698
00:47:15,401 --> 00:47:16,921
Please leave.
Right now!

699
00:47:17,801 --> 00:47:19,321
Take my car.

700
00:47:26,241 --> 00:47:27,241
Malini..

701
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:33,001
Guess I made a mistake.
I didn't find anything.

702
00:47:37,961 --> 00:47:39,761
And you keep doing mistakes
in your life.

703
00:47:40,521 --> 00:47:42,361
But you will never commit a mistake
when it comes to your work.

704
00:47:42,961 --> 00:47:44,121
It is not your habit.

705
00:48:00,121 --> 00:48:06,321
"I feel restless at every moment.."

706
00:48:06,401 --> 00:48:12,401
"Without you, O' beloved.."

707
00:48:13,241 --> 00:48:19,601
"This heart feels fearful.."

708
00:48:19,641 --> 00:48:25,681
"Without you, O' beloved.."

709
00:48:26,481 --> 00:48:32,601
"I feel restless at every moment.."

710
00:48:32,681 --> 00:48:38,201
"Without you, O' beloved.."

711
00:48:38,281 --> 00:48:40,961
'You're involving religion here.'

712
00:48:41,121 --> 00:48:42,681
'It will get serious now.
Please get out of here.'

713
00:48:42,721 --> 00:48:44,041
No, this..
- Come on!

714
00:48:44,081 --> 00:48:45,001
What are you guys doing?

715
00:48:46,641 --> 00:48:49,561
I had warned you earlier to not
stop us from doing our job.

716
00:48:51,121 --> 00:48:52,521
Father-in-law, please stop him.

717
00:48:52,561 --> 00:48:54,681
It is against our tradition.
How shall we let him inside?

718
00:48:54,721 --> 00:48:58,201
Ma'am, we don't want to hurt
anyone's sentiments.

719
00:48:58,241 --> 00:49:00,481
But our previous raids
have hinted at the fact

720
00:48:58,241 --> 00:49:00,481
But our previous raids
have hinted at the fact

721
00:49:00,561 --> 00:49:01,881
that people hide
money in temples.

722
00:49:01,881 --> 00:49:04,081
You won't find anything
in this temple.

723
00:49:04,361 --> 00:49:05,721
Let us just check.

724
00:49:06,521 --> 00:49:07,921
Please remove your wallet,
shoes and belt before entering

725
00:49:07,961 --> 00:49:09,081
the temple.
Wash your hands and face.

726
00:49:09,121 --> 00:49:12,641
Hey! That's not going to happen.
- Wait!

727
00:49:14,481 --> 00:49:16,641
Just one room is left
for them to search.

728
00:49:17,801 --> 00:49:18,921
Please go ahead!

729
00:49:19,361 --> 00:49:20,481
Please go!

730
00:49:21,401 --> 00:49:22,721
Let's go!

731
00:49:35,961 --> 00:49:40,001
Goddess Lakshmi, please help us
or we will be in trouble.

732
00:49:48,961 --> 00:49:50,441
Up there..
- Yes..

733
00:49:52,121 --> 00:49:53,241
Up there..

734
00:49:58,561 --> 00:49:59,441
Did you find anything?

735
00:50:00,081 --> 00:50:01,081
Nothing, sir.

736
00:50:01,121 --> 00:50:02,161
There's nothing.

737
00:50:06,481 --> 00:50:07,521
Are you satisfied?

738
00:50:33,881 --> 00:50:34,841
I'll be right back.

739
00:50:42,601 --> 00:50:44,761
'You may not find all the money
with the help of this map.'

740
00:50:45,321 --> 00:50:46,961
'But you will find the rest of it.'

741
00:50:47,401 --> 00:50:49,481
'I have faith in your
intelligence and fate.'

742
00:50:49,681 --> 00:50:51,521
'Just like in your courage.'

743
00:50:52,121 --> 00:50:55,361
'One more thing, no one should
get their hands on this letter.'

744
00:51:45,441 --> 00:51:46,681
Lallan!
- Sir?

745
00:51:47,121 --> 00:51:48,161
Break it!

746
00:51:50,321 --> 00:51:51,441
Break it!

747
00:52:04,761 --> 00:52:08,041
"Black.."

748
00:52:08,281 --> 00:52:15,161
"Black.."

749
00:52:15,441 --> 00:52:22,441
"Black.."

750
00:52:22,801 --> 00:52:27,041
"Black.."

751
00:52:31,121 --> 00:52:33,721
One thing is decided that tomorrow
won't be my last day at work.

752
00:52:34,641 --> 00:52:35,801
This is not mine.

753
00:52:36,961 --> 00:52:37,881
This is..

754
00:52:39,361 --> 00:52:40,441
Whose is it?

755
00:52:41,961 --> 00:52:42,961
Who kept it there?

756
00:52:45,881 --> 00:52:47,121
I am asking all of you,
who kept it there?

757
00:52:48,641 --> 00:52:51,921
Anubhav? Dear?
Tell me.

758
00:52:54,321 --> 00:52:55,601
Who kept all this money there?

759
00:52:56,481 --> 00:52:58,721
You're asking my question,
Mr. Rameshwar Singh!

760
00:52:59,521 --> 00:53:02,201
If you find the answer,
please let us know.

761
00:52:59,521 --> 00:53:02,201
If you find the answer,
please let us know.

762
00:53:06,201 --> 00:53:09,801
Please come outside.

763
00:53:16,441 --> 00:53:19,361
Sir, please leave.

764
00:53:20,361 --> 00:53:24,401
I will pay you
Rs. 5 lakhs in cash.

765
00:53:27,121 --> 00:53:28,281
Only Rs. 5 lakhs?

766
00:53:30,201 --> 00:53:33,361
Do you know how many zeros
are there in a lakh?

767
00:53:35,721 --> 00:53:37,601
There are only two zeros in 1,500.

768
00:53:38,721 --> 00:53:40,721
And the government has
allowed me only that.

769
00:53:44,121 --> 00:53:47,201
I'll take the rest of Rs. 420 crores
owned by the government.

770
00:53:47,601 --> 00:53:49,241
You don't know, Officer.

771
00:53:50,681 --> 00:53:52,761
Things may get bad for you.

772
00:53:54,241 --> 00:53:57,481
You may have to take the
Rs. 21 back from Bajaj.

773
00:53:59,241 --> 00:54:01,801
I never asked for return of
something I have parted with.

774
00:53:59,241 --> 00:54:01,801
I never asked for return of
something I have parted with.

775
00:54:02,801 --> 00:54:04,241
Not even my love and honour!

776
00:54:18,441 --> 00:54:21,801
Whose money was it?

777
00:54:26,801 --> 00:54:30,401
Tell me about all that
you have hidden

778
00:54:31,841 --> 00:54:32,921
and about the places.

779
00:54:38,881 --> 00:54:40,041
All right!

780
00:55:47,321 --> 00:55:48,601
Yes, sir?

781
00:56:01,841 --> 00:56:04,121
Sir..
Careful. It's heavy.

782
00:56:12,441 --> 00:56:13,361
Come on.

783
00:56:23,441 --> 00:56:24,801
Maybe this isn't yours as well.

784
00:56:26,321 --> 00:56:27,921
That means,
this belongs to the government.

785
00:56:50,361 --> 00:56:51,321
Oh, Lord!
- What are you doing?

786
00:56:51,401 --> 00:56:53,201
Bastard!
- No.. No!

787
00:56:53,241 --> 00:56:55,161
I won't spare them!
- Take all this away..

788
00:56:55,201 --> 00:56:56,721
I won't spare them!
- Take all this away..

789
00:56:56,761 --> 00:56:57,721
He's doing as he pleases!

790
00:56:57,801 --> 00:56:58,761
What are you doing?
- No..

791
00:56:58,841 --> 00:57:01,161
I will shoot! Let go!
- Don't..

792
00:56:58,841 --> 00:57:01,161
I will shoot! Let go!
- Don't..

793
00:58:33,961 --> 00:58:35,761
Don't give me
that smug look, Officer.

794
00:58:37,801 --> 00:58:39,441
Just let me make a phone call.

795
00:58:40,681 --> 00:58:42,761
Then I will put you in your place.

796
00:58:43,121 --> 00:58:44,961
You have fulfilled my last wish.

797
00:58:45,801 --> 00:58:47,681
I always return the favour.

798
00:58:49,601 --> 00:58:50,681
Tell me.

799
00:58:51,521 --> 00:58:52,481
Whom do you want to call?

800
00:58:54,881 --> 00:58:56,921
Sir, Mr. Rameshwar Singh
wants to talk to you.

801
00:58:57,201 --> 00:58:58,841
Why did you connect
the phone, Amay?

802
00:58:59,201 --> 00:59:02,481
So that he understands
that this is a futile attempt.

803
00:58:59,201 --> 00:59:02,481
So that he understands
that this is a futile attempt.

804
00:59:06,041 --> 00:59:08,921
Sir, stop this raid.

805
00:59:10,201 --> 00:59:11,521
You will be able to save your job.

806
00:59:12,921 --> 00:59:14,241
You will also be rewarded.

807
00:59:14,921 --> 00:59:16,281
I have to work
for only six more months.

808
00:59:17,081 --> 00:59:18,081
I don't care if I lose my job.

809
00:59:19,681 --> 00:59:21,801
Hello.
H-Hello..

810
00:59:28,761 --> 00:59:29,761
Are you happy now?

811
00:59:29,801 --> 00:59:32,641
If a lion is trapped
in a cage, Patnaik

812
00:59:33,921 --> 00:59:36,001
several people flock around
to mock it.

813
00:59:37,721 --> 00:59:39,441
If you set it free

814
00:59:40,361 --> 00:59:42,321
it will make your life
a living hell.

815
00:59:42,361 --> 00:59:43,601
I guarantee you that.

816
00:59:48,801 --> 00:59:49,961
Satish.

817
00:59:51,441 --> 00:59:53,241
Bring him one of our cars.

818
00:59:53,881 --> 00:59:55,961
Sir, what are you doing?

819
00:59:56,561 --> 00:59:58,001
No one can enter or exit.

820
00:59:58,041 --> 00:59:59,481
This is against the rules, right?

821
00:59:59,561 --> 01:00:02,001
Do you think people like him
are concerned about the rules?

822
00:59:59,561 --> 01:00:02,001
Do you think people like him
are concerned about the rules?

823
01:00:03,681 --> 01:00:06,281
Let him go.
How far will he go?

824
01:00:06,841 --> 01:00:07,961
No matter where he goes,
a public servant

825
01:00:08,001 --> 01:00:09,521
will be waiting for him.

826
01:00:11,121 --> 01:00:13,441
I will stay here
and continue my raid

827
01:00:14,641 --> 01:00:16,241
till I find the money.

828
01:00:17,961 --> 01:00:21,641
You are really arrogant
about your honesty, isn't it?

829
01:00:23,121 --> 01:00:25,921
This isn't arrogance.
It is courage.

830
01:00:26,881 --> 01:00:29,121
The poor are not responsible
for their poverty.

831
01:00:31,121 --> 01:00:33,241
Dishonest rich men like you
are responsible

832
01:00:33,561 --> 01:00:35,001
for their poverty.

833
01:00:36,761 --> 01:00:39,961
Mr. Rameshwar, go outside

834
01:00:41,001 --> 01:00:43,201
and try your best
to stop this raid.

835
01:00:44,081 --> 01:00:45,041
Leave.

836
01:00:45,081 --> 01:00:46,281
Sir, please..
- Satish!

837
01:00:47,561 --> 01:00:48,681
The car.

838
01:01:16,961 --> 01:01:18,121
Sir, what brings you here?

839
01:01:18,161 --> 01:01:21,281
Greetings, sir.
- Don't act in front of me! Got it?

840
01:01:21,601 --> 01:01:23,801
You orchestrated a raid in my house

841
01:01:23,841 --> 01:01:25,121
and now, you are acting innocent!

842
01:01:25,201 --> 01:01:26,281
Raid? What raid, sir?
- Hey..

843
01:01:26,321 --> 01:01:28,561
Just tell me
where the Chief Minister is.

844
01:01:28,721 --> 01:01:30,681
Sir, he just left
for his residence.

845
01:01:37,361 --> 01:01:38,561
At least drink some tea, sir.

846
01:01:38,841 --> 01:01:43,521
Radheshyam Tiwari, tell me.
How could you allow this?

847
01:01:43,561 --> 01:01:47,041
Sir, no one consulted with the
state government regarding this.

848
01:01:47,081 --> 01:01:48,401
Anyway, the Income Tax department

849
01:01:48,441 --> 01:01:49,641
falls under the central government.

850
01:01:49,721 --> 01:01:51,601
What could I have done about it?
- Why can't you?

851
01:01:52,281 --> 01:01:53,241
Why can't you do anything?

852
01:01:53,321 --> 01:01:54,481
You are the Chief Minister
after all!

853
01:01:55,281 --> 01:01:58,041
Come on, call him up and talk
to him. Talk to him right away.

854
01:01:58,081 --> 01:02:00,081
Mr. Singh, I can't give
any orders in this matter.

855
01:01:58,081 --> 01:02:00,081
Mr. Singh, I can't give
any orders in this matter.

856
01:02:00,201 --> 01:02:02,521
Moreover, you had spoken
with the Director General.

857
01:02:02,561 --> 01:02:04,401
Listen, stop this nonsense
of yours, okay?

858
01:02:04,881 --> 01:02:05,961
Just do what I asked you to.

859
01:02:06,321 --> 01:02:08,001
Come on, call him up right away!

860
01:02:08,721 --> 01:02:10,961
Goodness! No one can knock
some sense into you.

861
01:02:11,001 --> 01:02:12,881
Listen, go to the prayer room.

862
01:02:13,121 --> 01:02:14,401
Bring 'The Gita' from there.

863
01:02:14,521 --> 01:02:15,841
Have you lost your mind?

864
01:02:16,681 --> 01:02:18,321
Have you taken leave
of your senses?

865
01:02:18,641 --> 01:02:19,921
Mr. Singh, I am not the one
who has gone crazy.

866
01:02:20,121 --> 01:02:22,961
Tell me. What can I do
when you don't even trust me?

867
01:02:23,081 --> 01:02:26,201
If you like, I can call my daughter
and swear on her.

868
01:02:30,081 --> 01:02:31,161
All right.

869
01:02:32,161 --> 01:02:33,441
Book a trunk call for me.

870
01:02:35,401 --> 01:02:36,921
Don't just nod your head.
Get it done!

871
01:02:39,761 --> 01:02:41,881
I may be a junior giving advice
but what you did is wrong, sir.

872
01:02:42,561 --> 01:02:43,481
Rameshwar Singh said a few things

873
01:02:43,521 --> 01:02:45,561
and you reacted to it.
That's exactly what he wanted.

874
01:02:45,841 --> 01:02:47,481
I agree that I
shouldn't have let him go

875
01:02:47,761 --> 01:02:49,481
but am I the only one
who is wrong, Lallan?

876
01:02:50,561 --> 01:02:51,801
What about you?

877
01:02:55,161 --> 01:02:56,961
I know what you are trying to do

878
01:02:57,321 --> 01:03:00,041
but I'm giving you a chance
to rectify your mistakes.

879
01:02:57,321 --> 01:03:00,041
but I'm giving you a chance
to rectify your mistakes.

880
01:03:01,321 --> 01:03:02,801
And I am giving myself
a similar chance too.

881
01:03:02,841 --> 01:03:03,801
Sir, you don't understand.

882
01:03:03,841 --> 01:03:05,361
He will go out..
- He'll pressurise the authorities

883
01:03:06,081 --> 01:03:07,081
to stop the raid, right?

884
01:03:09,001 --> 01:03:12,921
I can ignore many such pressures
and phone calls but..

885
01:03:13,121 --> 01:03:14,041
But what, sir?

886
01:03:14,721 --> 01:03:16,601
Sometimes, the orders come
from the highest authority.

887
01:03:17,401 --> 01:03:18,641
Right from the top.

888
01:03:20,041 --> 01:03:21,881
And we have to follow those orders.

889
01:03:22,241 --> 01:03:23,481
But in order to reach
that level of authority

890
01:03:23,521 --> 01:03:26,481
it will take Rameshwar Singh
about 14 to 18 hours.

891
01:03:27,841 --> 01:03:29,481
We have to complete
the recovery before that.

892
01:03:29,561 --> 01:03:32,321
Sir, he will kill you,
your family and us as well.

893
01:03:32,921 --> 01:03:36,321
I won't let anything happen
to you all. I promise that.

894
01:03:36,641 --> 01:03:38,361
Sorry, sir. You may be
a crazy man but the problem is

895
01:03:38,401 --> 01:03:40,681
that you have let
an even crazier man loose.

896
01:03:40,721 --> 01:03:41,921
Arguing over it is useless.

897
01:03:43,321 --> 01:03:44,921
We have less than 24 hours

898
01:03:45,001 --> 01:03:46,161
to complete the recovery.
So, shall we go?

899
01:03:46,241 --> 01:03:47,161
Hello!

900
01:03:47,201 --> 01:03:50,641
Hello!
- Hello!

901
01:03:50,681 --> 01:03:53,521
Did you have no information
about this raid?

902
01:03:53,601 --> 01:03:55,161
I got to know about it later.
- What?

903
01:03:55,441 --> 01:03:58,241
Amay Patnaik had
the correct information.

904
01:03:58,441 --> 01:03:59,721
Moreover, he had proof.

905
01:03:59,761 --> 01:04:02,721
Listen, you may not have been
able to stop the raid back then

906
01:03:59,761 --> 01:04:02,721
Listen, you may not have been
able to stop the raid back then

907
01:04:02,761 --> 01:04:04,801
but you can do so now, can't you?

908
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:06,841
Mr. Patnaik,
I may have signed these documents

909
01:04:07,721 --> 01:04:10,761
but this really won't help
as you will take all these things

910
01:04:10,801 --> 01:04:12,481
and deposit them
in the government treasury

911
01:04:12,841 --> 01:04:13,641
and when the government

912
01:04:13,721 --> 01:04:15,361
wishes to spend it
for the betterment of the public

913
01:04:16,201 --> 01:04:18,681
people like him will loot it again.

914
01:04:19,441 --> 01:04:22,321
Sir, do you stop teaching
if any of your students fail?

915
01:04:23,081 --> 01:04:23,961
You don't, do you?

916
01:04:24,561 --> 01:04:26,041
In fact, you put in more effort
next time

917
01:04:26,561 --> 01:04:27,601
so that no student fails.

918
01:04:31,041 --> 01:04:33,001
Sir, there is a phone call for you.

919
01:04:37,441 --> 01:04:38,521
Yes, sir?

920
01:04:39,481 --> 01:04:43,921
Sure, sir.
S-Sure.. S-Sure, sir..

921
01:04:45,081 --> 01:04:46,041
H-He is here.
I will give him the receiver.

922
01:04:46,081 --> 01:04:48,081
Sir, well..
It is the Finance Minister.

923
01:04:48,321 --> 01:04:49,321
Answer the phone.

924
01:04:49,641 --> 01:04:51,841
It is time for you
to leave your current position.

925
01:04:55,241 --> 01:04:56,241
Hello, sir?

926
01:04:56,601 --> 01:04:59,761
Mr. Patnaik,
the raid was successful

927
01:05:00,241 --> 01:05:01,321
and the recovery was completed too.

928
01:05:02,161 --> 01:05:03,401
Now, you all can leave that place.

929
01:05:03,841 --> 01:05:06,921
Waiting in a respectable man's home
at night is not right.

930
01:05:07,201 --> 01:05:10,081
Why harass the family
unnecessarily?

931
01:05:12,801 --> 01:05:14,201
Sir, as per the information

932
01:05:14,241 --> 01:05:16,841
we haven't been able to recover
most of the black money.

933
01:05:18,721 --> 01:05:20,481
The moment we hit
the recovery amount

934
01:05:20,641 --> 01:05:21,801
we will stop the raid.

935
01:05:22,921 --> 01:05:23,921
Anything else, sir?

936
01:05:25,401 --> 01:05:26,361
It is your call.

937
01:05:27,001 --> 01:05:28,801
Just end the raid
as soon as you can.

938
01:05:29,561 --> 01:05:31,241
Thank you, sir.
'Jai Hind.'

939
01:05:33,601 --> 01:05:37,201
Mr. Rakesh,
tomorrow will be a long day.

940
01:05:37,561 --> 01:05:38,681
So, go take rest.

941
01:05:39,121 --> 01:05:40,241
Good night, sir.

942
01:06:00,401 --> 01:06:01,521
You've got guts..

943
01:06:02,441 --> 01:06:03,481
You are spending the night
in the presence

944
01:06:03,561 --> 01:06:04,841
of the women of this family.

945
01:06:05,521 --> 01:06:06,721
It is for work, not pleasure.

946
01:06:08,841 --> 01:06:10,761
Let me through.
- What if I don't?

947
01:06:12,081 --> 01:06:12,961
What will you do?

948
01:06:14,241 --> 01:06:16,481
Will you yell?

949
01:06:17,041 --> 01:06:20,441
What if I scream?
You will be killed.

950
01:06:21,321 --> 01:06:23,041
One scream of mine and your
attitude will perish in seconds.

951
01:06:24,321 --> 01:06:25,801
Hence, listen to me real carefully.

952
01:06:29,721 --> 01:06:31,761
What kind of romance is breeding
between you two?

953
01:06:37,001 --> 01:06:38,361
I was discharging the duties
of a daughter-in-law.

954
01:06:39,361 --> 01:06:41,761
You cunning woman!

955
01:06:41,881 --> 01:06:43,561
I understand everything.

956
01:06:43,921 --> 01:06:46,681
I'm wise and experienced.

957
01:06:48,121 --> 01:06:49,201
Old woman, listen.

958
01:06:49,241 --> 01:06:51,321
He wasn't leaving even after
being pressurised and threatened.

959
01:06:51,521 --> 01:06:54,481
I thought of using my womanhood
to throw him out of our home.

960
01:06:55,161 --> 01:06:58,521
But you ruined everything
by showing up like a witch.

961
01:06:58,561 --> 01:07:02,561
I will teach you a lesson
you'll remember!

962
01:06:58,561 --> 01:07:02,561
I will teach you a lesson
you'll remember!

963
01:07:02,841 --> 01:07:04,321
You can't even find your own room

964
01:07:04,641 --> 01:07:06,201
and you're talking
about teaching me a lesson.

965
01:07:25,721 --> 01:07:27,041
What if she had screamed for real?

966
01:07:27,761 --> 01:07:29,881
Rameshwar and his family
are not good people, Amay.

967
01:07:30,241 --> 01:07:33,681
Please leave that house.
You upset the Finance Minister too.

968
01:07:34,081 --> 01:07:36,681
You know very well that ministers
are experts in taking revenge.

969
01:07:37,241 --> 01:07:39,241
Nothing will happen to me.
Don't worry.

970
01:07:39,681 --> 01:07:40,761
Who are you trying to convince?

971
01:07:41,081 --> 01:07:42,201
Me or yourself?

972
01:07:42,441 --> 01:07:43,521
Malini..

973
01:07:45,281 --> 01:07:46,721
Please take care of yourself.

974
01:08:00,801 --> 01:08:04,481
No, M-Mr. Kumar.. Please
don't tell me all these things.

975
01:08:04,721 --> 01:08:05,641
Mr. Singh, listen.

976
01:08:05,761 --> 01:08:09,281
If I pressurise him too much
and the press finds out about it

977
01:08:09,561 --> 01:08:11,881
then all the newspapers
will be on my case.

978
01:08:12,001 --> 01:08:13,081
Tell me something.

979
01:08:13,321 --> 01:08:16,081
You people ask for money
from me in the name of party fund

980
01:08:16,161 --> 01:08:17,481
and I give the party
a lot of money.

981
01:08:17,521 --> 01:08:19,561
Where does this fear
disappear then?

982
01:08:19,601 --> 01:08:21,561
Mr. Singh, calm down, please.

983
01:08:22,921 --> 01:08:25,161
Now, there's just one way
to stop him.

984
01:08:33,801 --> 01:08:35,241
Let me check it.

985
01:08:38,481 --> 01:08:41,441
Hey..
This is the map of my house.

986
01:08:43,361 --> 01:08:45,241
Good Lord!

987
01:08:45,281 --> 01:08:47,401
That's why these things
are happening.

988
01:08:47,841 --> 01:08:51,601
I had the house built
as per 'Vastu Shastra'

989
01:08:52,041 --> 01:08:56,281
but this son of mine, Rameshwar..

990
01:08:57,001 --> 01:08:58,681
His younger brothers

991
01:08:59,241 --> 01:09:02,041
changed the structure
and spoilt everything.

992
01:08:59,241 --> 01:09:02,041
changed the structure
and spoilt everything.

993
01:09:04,801 --> 01:09:08,161
Ma'am, what structural changes?

994
01:09:08,641 --> 01:09:11,241
For example, this pillar.
You see it, right?

995
01:09:11,281 --> 01:09:13,041
What weight is it carrying?

996
01:09:13,561 --> 01:09:15,001
There was no need
to build this pillar here.

997
01:09:16,921 --> 01:09:18,681
The staircase is one
and a half feet in length.

998
01:09:18,721 --> 01:09:20,361
What was the need to construct it?

999
01:09:20,641 --> 01:09:22,481
Anyone could've jumped over it.

1000
01:09:24,361 --> 01:09:27,121
They spoilt everything.
- Let me see it.

1001
01:10:03,241 --> 01:10:06,641
Good Lord!
Who owns all this?

1002
01:10:08,561 --> 01:10:09,801
Is this yours, Brother-in-law?

1003
01:10:10,161 --> 01:10:13,041
He who got this constructed,
owns these things.

1004
01:10:13,121 --> 01:10:16,761
Oh, yes! So, this is yours
and that pillar is his.

1005
01:10:16,801 --> 01:10:18,921
Hey!
- What about that tank of yours?

1006
01:10:18,961 --> 01:10:22,361
It is pretty obvious. Look!
We know who owns what.

1007
01:10:22,401 --> 01:10:25,961
I have been staying in this house
for the past 70 years.

1008
01:10:26,841 --> 01:10:30,681
I don't know
where the money is hidden.

1009
01:10:30,961 --> 01:10:34,521
So, how did that guy
get to know about it?

1010
01:10:34,721 --> 01:10:38,001
I bet he has a map.

1011
01:10:47,121 --> 01:10:48,041
What's the matter, sir?

1012
01:10:53,201 --> 01:10:55,161
Will you please tell me
what happened?

1013
01:10:55,801 --> 01:10:58,161
Do you know what business
is being run in your name?

1014
01:10:59,761 --> 01:11:01,001
Liquor stores.

1015
01:10:59,761 --> 01:11:01,001
Liquor stores.

1016
01:11:02,201 --> 01:11:04,681
Even the excise department
is being duped by using your name.

1017
01:11:06,321 --> 01:11:07,281
Everything is mentioned in this.

1018
01:11:08,441 --> 01:11:11,721
If we show the police these papers,
you'll surely get arrested.

1019
01:11:12,601 --> 01:11:15,961
Sir, you don't know my brother yet.
He won't let anything happen to me.

1020
01:11:16,001 --> 01:11:17,521
But I will certainly do it.

1021
01:11:21,321 --> 01:11:24,561
Excise, FERA..
There are a ton of violations.

1022
01:11:24,841 --> 01:11:26,721
Sending the white money
of this country abroad

1023
01:11:26,761 --> 01:11:28,761
is an act of treason
which will put you behind bars.

1024
01:11:28,801 --> 01:11:31,241
Treason!
What are you talking about?

1025
01:11:31,481 --> 01:11:34,241
Brother's brother-in-law handles
all the monetary transactions.

1026
01:11:34,281 --> 01:11:36,121
I fall in the category
of a true patriot.

1027
01:11:37,121 --> 01:11:39,321
What about the money
that you've hidden here?

1028
01:11:42,241 --> 01:11:44,041
All right.
It is your wish.

1029
01:11:45,641 --> 01:11:47,561
I came here to make a deal.
- Sir, listen.

1030
01:11:48,161 --> 01:11:50,321
What do I have to do?

1031
01:11:52,721 --> 01:11:54,161
Tell us whatever you know

1032
01:11:55,641 --> 01:11:58,281
including the things
that you have hidden here.

1033
01:12:03,361 --> 01:12:04,201
Okay..

1034
01:12:49,641 --> 01:12:50,721
Greetings, Mr. Singh!

1035
01:12:50,761 --> 01:12:52,761
Greetings.
- Please sit down.

1036
01:12:54,841 --> 01:12:56,681
Did you have some tea?

1037
01:12:56,761 --> 01:13:00,121
I've been drinking it
since morning. No more, please.

1038
01:12:56,761 --> 01:13:00,121
I've been drinking it
since morning. No more, please.

1039
01:13:00,961 --> 01:13:03,681
Just do me a favour, Mr. Singh.
Please let me meet ma'am.

1040
01:13:05,881 --> 01:13:08,641
It doesn't work like that.

1041
01:13:09,481 --> 01:13:12,161
She is the Prime Minister,
not some DM or collector

1042
01:13:12,321 --> 01:13:14,761
that you can meet her
as and when you please.

1043
01:13:15,081 --> 01:13:17,041
You need to take an appointment.

1044
01:13:17,081 --> 01:13:19,721
I understand that very well.

1045
01:13:19,801 --> 01:13:21,921
But, Mr. Singh, it is an emergency.

1046
01:13:23,281 --> 01:13:27,201
The Income Tax department
is carrying out a raid in my house.

1047
01:13:27,601 --> 01:13:28,601
I want it to stop.

1048
01:13:28,681 --> 01:13:31,241
Please let me meet her once.
It is very urgent.

1049
01:13:33,761 --> 01:13:34,721
Listen, Mr. Singh..

1050
01:13:35,961 --> 01:13:38,201
I won't be able to trouble her

1051
01:13:38,961 --> 01:13:41,161
regarding such a trivial matter.

1052
01:14:15,601 --> 01:14:22,841
"Black.."

1053
01:14:22,921 --> 01:14:29,761
"Black.."

1054
01:14:29,801 --> 01:14:33,161
"By tearing down walls
and drilling through doors"

1055
01:14:33,401 --> 01:14:36,761
"we will dig up
all that is buried."

1056
01:14:37,121 --> 01:14:40,481
"What's there in the vaults
or the sealed sacks?"

1057
01:14:40,601 --> 01:14:43,921
"Certain things lie hidden."

1058
01:14:43,961 --> 01:14:51,241
"It showcases all the aspects
of your illegal businesses."

1059
01:14:51,401 --> 01:14:58,481
"This treasure of yours"

1060
01:14:58,561 --> 01:15:04,441
"is black.
It's black money."

1061
01:14:58,561 --> 01:15:04,441
"is black.
It's black money."

1062
01:15:04,481 --> 01:15:06,361
"There's no receipt
for all this money."

1063
01:15:06,401 --> 01:15:11,841
"Black.
It's black money."

1064
01:15:11,881 --> 01:15:13,841
"It's a hundred times more than
what you've rightfully earned."

1065
01:15:33,801 --> 01:15:37,401
"By tearing down walls.."

1066
01:15:49,201 --> 01:15:52,801
Ma'am, Rameshwar's allies
in Lucknow have joined hands.

1067
01:15:53,721 --> 01:15:56,161
He said that if I don't fix
an appointment with you

1068
01:15:57,241 --> 01:15:59,201
he will dissolve
Radheshyam Tiwari's government.

1069
01:16:01,921 --> 01:16:02,961
Five minutes.

1070
01:16:05,041 --> 01:16:08,361
Mother, why are you angry?
Mother?

1071
01:16:09,241 --> 01:16:11,521
When you have so much money

1072
01:16:12,481 --> 01:16:14,841
couldn't you get me treated when
you know I'm battling renal stones?

1073
01:16:15,321 --> 01:16:18,441
All you say is.. 'Mother,
please drink plenty of water.'

1074
01:16:18,521 --> 01:16:21,121
'They will get expelled.'
- But you're old and diabetic..

1075
01:16:23,281 --> 01:16:26,921
"You've earned it dishonestly."

1076
01:16:27,001 --> 01:16:30,561
"You've stolen it."

1077
01:16:30,601 --> 01:16:34,121
"You've collected and hidden it"

1078
01:16:34,361 --> 01:16:38,561
"from the public!"

1079
01:16:38,601 --> 01:16:40,441
"Convince, bribe,
punish, exploit.."

1080
01:16:40,481 --> 01:16:42,241
"You don't have any regrets."

1081
01:16:42,281 --> 01:16:43,961
"You're the gaping hole"

1082
01:16:44,001 --> 01:16:45,921
"in this country's economy."

1083
01:16:45,961 --> 01:16:47,721
"Convince, bribe,
punish, exploit.."

1084
01:16:47,801 --> 01:16:49,481
"You don't have any regrets."

1085
01:16:49,521 --> 01:16:51,201
"You're the gaping hole"

1086
01:16:51,241 --> 01:16:53,161
"in this country's economy."

1087
01:16:53,201 --> 01:16:56,641
"It may be late
but it sure is an effective raid!"

1088
01:16:56,961 --> 01:17:00,361
"It is like a tight slap."

1089
01:16:56,961 --> 01:17:00,361
"It is like a tight slap."

1090
01:17:00,481 --> 01:17:04,001
"He wants the details
of all your misdeeds."

1091
01:17:04,041 --> 01:17:07,681
"It's the person who's standing
with the books of accounts."

1092
01:17:10,121 --> 01:17:14,281
Sir, the quantity of the gold coins
and the jewellery is a lot.

1093
01:17:14,321 --> 01:17:15,441
Never had we imagined
that it would be this much.

1094
01:17:15,481 --> 01:17:18,241
We don't have time
to measure it in grams.

1095
01:17:18,401 --> 01:17:20,041
And the weighing machine
doesn't have the required weights.

1096
01:17:21,681 --> 01:17:22,481
Here's what you need to do..

1097
01:17:22,521 --> 01:17:27,481
"It showcases all the aspects
of your illegal businesses."

1098
01:17:27,561 --> 01:17:28,561
Add more weight, please.

1099
01:17:29,841 --> 01:17:36,801
"This treasure of yours"

1100
01:17:36,841 --> 01:17:39,081
"is black.
It's black money.."

1101
01:17:39,121 --> 01:17:40,281
Had my mother been alive, she would

1102
01:17:40,321 --> 01:17:42,281
have been happy to see me
getting weighed in gold.

1103
01:17:42,801 --> 01:17:44,801
"There's no receipt
for all this money."

1104
01:17:45,561 --> 01:17:46,801
Abdul, you need to form
three teams.

1105
01:17:47,161 --> 01:17:48,201
Send one of the teams here

1106
01:17:48,521 --> 01:17:49,641
and the other two need to leave
for Anubhav

1107
01:17:49,681 --> 01:17:52,001
and Rakesh Singh's factories.
Seize everything.

1108
01:17:52,241 --> 01:17:54,721
"It's black money.."

1109
01:17:54,761 --> 01:17:56,201
Send one team to the
co-operative bank

1110
01:17:56,441 --> 01:17:58,321
and get those lockers sealed.
Immediately.

1111
01:17:59,201 --> 01:18:02,721
"He will take you by storm."

1112
01:17:59,201 --> 01:18:02,721
"He will take you by storm."

1113
01:18:02,761 --> 01:18:04,281
Seal all the bank accounts

1114
01:18:04,321 --> 01:18:05,681
of Reshma Industries
and Suraj Rice Mill.

1115
01:18:06,041 --> 01:18:07,961
They are involved in the evasion
of sales tax and excise.

1116
01:18:08,281 --> 01:18:09,801
Also, inform
the respective departments.

1117
01:18:10,241 --> 01:18:13,801
"It's black money."

1118
01:18:13,921 --> 01:18:19,281
"It's black money."

1119
01:18:21,401 --> 01:18:22,361
Sir, there is a call for you.

1120
01:18:38,121 --> 01:18:40,481
Mr. Patnaik,
this is the Prime Minister.

1121
01:18:42,121 --> 01:18:43,481
'Jai Hind',
Madam Prime Minister.

1122
01:18:45,321 --> 01:18:49,641
Mr. Patnaik, if your department
is suspicious of Rameshwar Singh

1123
01:18:49,961 --> 01:18:51,961
or if you have any complaints
against him

1124
01:18:52,281 --> 01:18:53,561
can you move
with the proceedings

1125
01:18:53,601 --> 01:18:54,881
on some other legal angle?

1126
01:18:57,081 --> 01:18:59,521
Ma'am, I can only confirm that
after taking legal opinion

1127
01:18:59,761 --> 01:19:02,881
but if you insist,
I can explore some legal angle.

1128
01:18:59,761 --> 01:19:02,881
but if you insist,
I can explore some legal angle.

1129
01:19:03,121 --> 01:19:04,601
Now, he is on the track.

1130
01:19:06,081 --> 01:19:07,161
Thank you, Mr. Patnaik.

1131
01:19:10,161 --> 01:19:12,121
You are most welcome, ma'am.
Ma'am

1132
01:19:12,881 --> 01:19:13,881
I have a request.

1133
01:19:14,241 --> 01:19:15,721
Can you, please, sign the orders

1134
01:19:16,121 --> 01:19:17,321
and have them sent to my office
through FAX?

1135
01:19:18,881 --> 01:19:21,201
Why are you insisting
on the written orders?

1136
01:19:23,761 --> 01:19:26,561
Madam Prime Minister,
it's difficult to find out

1137
01:19:26,601 --> 01:19:27,761
whether the orders
are really coming from you

1138
01:19:28,561 --> 01:19:31,601
or someone is impersonating you
to save the assessee.

1139
01:19:39,761 --> 01:19:41,561
My office will get back to you,
Mr. Patnaik.

1140
01:19:41,921 --> 01:19:42,961
I'll wait for your orders,
ma'am.

1141
01:19:43,841 --> 01:19:44,801
'Jai Hind', ma'am.

1142
01:19:54,321 --> 01:19:55,321
Ma'am, what..

1143
01:19:56,281 --> 01:19:59,641
You know we can't pressurise
an officer like that.

1144
01:20:00,081 --> 01:20:03,281
He is following the law,
you should also move legally.

1145
01:20:03,521 --> 01:20:05,481
No, actually..

1146
01:20:09,241 --> 01:20:12,401
Forgive me, ma'am,
but I have total supremacy

1147
01:20:12,801 --> 01:20:13,881
over my area.

1148
01:20:14,881 --> 01:20:16,721
Everyone knows

1149
01:20:18,161 --> 01:20:20,081
that I cannot be touched.

1150
01:20:20,321 --> 01:20:22,201
If the news of this raid spreads

1151
01:20:23,361 --> 01:20:24,921
my reign will be over.

1152
01:20:27,441 --> 01:20:28,961
Moreover, I represent you.

1153
01:20:30,361 --> 01:20:33,441
So, your reign is in danger
as well.

1154
01:20:52,041 --> 01:20:53,041
Goodbye.

1155
01:20:57,241 --> 01:20:59,201
Manan, keep an eye
on Officer Patnaik

1156
01:20:59,241 --> 01:21:01,681
and keep me updated.

1157
01:20:59,241 --> 01:21:01,681
and keep me updated.

1158
01:21:02,201 --> 01:21:03,521
Yes, Madam Prime Minister.

1159
01:21:23,881 --> 01:21:27,801
Are you not scared
that while you are away on duty

1160
01:21:28,681 --> 01:21:30,761
something might happen

1161
01:21:31,961 --> 01:21:34,161
to your wife?

1162
01:21:35,961 --> 01:21:38,481
Your better half is alone
at your house, right?

1163
01:21:39,681 --> 01:21:40,841
You must be scared.

1164
01:21:41,761 --> 01:21:44,281
You know what I asked as dowry
from my wife?

1165
01:21:46,121 --> 01:21:48,081
I'm sure it was not money.

1166
01:21:49,321 --> 01:21:50,321
Courage.

1167
01:21:50,761 --> 01:21:53,241
Courage. - I see!

1168
01:21:55,641 --> 01:21:57,641
That is something
worth asking for.

1169
01:21:58,601 --> 01:21:59,881
The thing is, Patnaik

1170
01:22:00,201 --> 01:22:02,281
if something happens
to a member of the family

1171
01:22:03,921 --> 01:22:06,761
you really need to be strong.

1172
01:22:35,641 --> 01:22:36,601
That way.

1173
01:22:39,321 --> 01:22:40,281
Ms. Malini?

1174
01:22:42,161 --> 01:22:43,201
Ma'am?

1175
01:22:44,081 --> 01:22:45,841
Here..
- Yes.

1176
01:23:16,881 --> 01:23:18,521
Take me to the PAC headquarters,
quickly.

1177
01:23:59,041 --> 01:24:00,241
Are you all right?

1178
01:23:59,041 --> 01:24:00,241
Are you all right?

1179
01:24:02,281 --> 01:24:03,961
If I tell you the truth,
will you marry someone else?

1180
01:24:04,681 --> 01:24:07,401
Malini, this is not the time
to crack jokes.

1181
01:24:07,561 --> 01:24:10,521
My face has got damaged a bit.

1182
01:24:11,841 --> 01:24:13,001
A piece of glass
penetrated through my skin.

1183
01:24:14,441 --> 01:24:16,361
They hit the window of the car
with a rod.

1184
01:24:17,401 --> 01:24:19,521
I am sorry.
Because of me, you were..

1185
01:24:20,841 --> 01:24:21,961
Amay, listen

1186
01:24:23,121 --> 01:24:25,121
he has damaged your wife's face.

1187
01:24:25,841 --> 01:24:26,841
No matter what happens

1188
01:24:27,921 --> 01:24:29,361
teach him a lesson.

1189
01:24:30,441 --> 01:24:32,441
I have arranged police
protection for you.

1190
01:24:33,881 --> 01:24:35,921
A PAC team is on their way
to the house.

1191
01:24:36,601 --> 01:24:37,721
And, listen

1192
01:24:38,721 --> 01:24:39,841
stay at home from now on.

1193
01:24:50,561 --> 01:24:51,681
Is this how you will keep it?

1194
01:24:51,721 --> 01:24:52,841
How could you..

1195
01:24:52,881 --> 01:24:54,361
Take him away.
- Take him away.

1196
01:24:54,401 --> 01:24:56,641
Keep it properly.
- Come on.

1197
01:24:56,681 --> 01:24:57,921
I'm telling you.
- Come with us.

1198
01:24:58,441 --> 01:24:59,721
For whom are you taking this?

1199
01:25:02,121 --> 01:25:03,801
How dare you?

1200
01:25:03,841 --> 01:25:04,801
Take him away.
- Come on, move.

1201
01:25:04,841 --> 01:25:06,641
Get lost from here!
- Come on, don't create a fuss.

1202
01:25:10,161 --> 01:25:12,401
Yes, I have reached.
I am all right, Amay

1203
01:25:12,961 --> 01:25:14,041
but when will you return?

1204
01:25:14,601 --> 01:25:15,681
I am scared.

1205
01:25:23,721 --> 01:25:27,561
Don't worry, he is all right so far.

1206
01:25:27,881 --> 01:25:28,881
Hello?

1207
01:25:29,881 --> 01:25:31,521
I'll call you back.
- Amay, listen..

1208
01:25:37,601 --> 01:25:38,681
Why did you hang up?

1209
01:25:40,201 --> 01:25:43,721
Did you not tell your wife
not to leave the house?

1210
01:25:44,041 --> 01:25:47,361
There are no more friends
of her husband in the city

1211
01:25:47,761 --> 01:25:49,161
there are only enemies.

1212
01:25:49,921 --> 01:25:51,801
The raid would have got you fined.

1213
01:25:53,441 --> 01:25:55,041
But now, you will be jailed.

1214
01:25:55,841 --> 01:25:57,961
You won't be able to prove it.

1215
01:26:00,321 --> 01:26:01,281
What happened?

1216
01:26:02,401 --> 01:26:03,441
Are you getting furious?

1217
01:26:05,041 --> 01:26:06,961
You feel like beating me up?

1218
01:26:08,641 --> 01:26:11,161
Oh, yes! I forgot!

1219
01:26:11,441 --> 01:26:14,521
Your hands are tied by the law!

1220
01:26:18,601 --> 01:26:20,161
But your hands and
your mouth are free.

1221
01:26:21,441 --> 01:26:24,441
But still, you couldn't manage
to avert the raid.

1222
01:27:13,841 --> 01:27:16,321
Don't worry about that officer.

1223
01:27:20,761 --> 01:27:24,001
His coming here
was not a problem.

1224
01:27:24,081 --> 01:27:26,481
He left from here,
that's a big problem.

1225
01:27:30,121 --> 01:27:33,081
But I shall solve that problem.

1226
01:27:38,361 --> 01:27:40,801
I've been hurt
by my own people.

1227
01:27:46,601 --> 01:27:50,441
I moved from one city to another
and built my empire.

1228
01:27:52,321 --> 01:27:54,521
And I didn't have a clue

1229
01:27:54,561 --> 01:27:55,961
about what's going on
in my own house.

1230
01:27:59,161 --> 01:28:01,801
In the name of fixing
the interiors of the house

1231
01:27:59,161 --> 01:28:01,801
In the name of fixing
the interiors of the house

1232
01:28:03,921 --> 01:28:06,161
you guys have fooled me.

1233
01:28:06,681 --> 01:28:11,161
My own have usurped money
from my business and kept it

1234
01:28:11,241 --> 01:28:14,841
hidden in my own house.

1235
01:28:17,321 --> 01:28:20,161
And someone from my own family
gave the information

1236
01:28:21,241 --> 01:28:23,961
to that officer.

1237
01:28:28,321 --> 01:28:29,721
What do you often say, Mom?

1238
01:28:30,841 --> 01:28:33,561
That Ravana was a warrior.

1239
01:28:34,721 --> 01:28:35,961
He was very knowledgeable.

1240
01:28:37,161 --> 01:28:39,201
He was a family man.

1241
01:28:40,761 --> 01:28:42,841
So, how would Lord Rama
have slayed him?

1242
01:28:45,841 --> 01:28:47,721
What did you tell me?

1243
01:28:48,841 --> 01:28:52,961
That Lord Rama didn't defeat Ravana.
So, who had defeated him?

1244
01:28:53,881 --> 01:28:56,441
His brother, Vibhishana.

1245
01:29:02,281 --> 01:29:03,241
So

1246
01:29:06,241 --> 01:29:07,721
let the traitor come forward

1247
01:29:11,001 --> 01:29:14,881
and confess to his crime.

1248
01:29:18,441 --> 01:29:19,921
I won't forgive that person.

1249
01:29:22,361 --> 01:29:24,761
But I promise to spare
that person's life.

1250
01:29:28,281 --> 01:29:29,801
Look, tell me on your own.

1251
01:29:32,281 --> 01:29:34,241
Otherwise, if I come to know
from someone else..

1252
01:29:34,961 --> 01:29:38,081
Who knows Rameshwar Singh

1253
01:29:38,121 --> 01:29:40,161
better than his family?

1254
01:29:49,401 --> 01:29:50,521
All right

1255
01:29:52,481 --> 01:29:55,201
if someone is destined
to die a painful death

1256
01:29:57,801 --> 01:29:59,361
so be it.

1257
01:30:03,481 --> 01:30:07,721
Dear, I've heard that this officer
doesn't even fear

1258
01:30:07,761 --> 01:30:09,921
the Prime Minister.

1259
01:30:11,281 --> 01:30:14,961
I suggest that you should apologise
to him.

1260
01:30:17,681 --> 01:30:21,161
Ravana should've asked

1261
01:30:21,481 --> 01:30:23,481
for forgiveness before dying.

1262
01:30:24,481 --> 01:30:25,801
Have the Jalebis, Mom.

1263
01:30:29,681 --> 01:30:31,081
Why aren't you giving it
to me, Brother?

1264
01:30:31,801 --> 01:30:34,041
Do you want to usurp this as well?

1265
01:30:45,001 --> 01:30:46,281
Here, Mom, have the Jalebi.

1266
01:30:46,601 --> 01:30:49,441
No, I have diabetes, right?
I won't eat it.

1267
01:30:49,481 --> 01:30:52,041
Nothing will happen
if you have one, have it.

1268
01:30:52,081 --> 01:30:54,961
I don't want to eat it!
- Have it. I'm feeding you!

1269
01:30:55,801 --> 01:30:57,401
Can't you hear me?
Have it.

1270
01:30:57,601 --> 01:30:58,561
Have it.

1271
01:30:59,321 --> 01:31:00,361
Chew it.

1272
01:30:59,321 --> 01:31:00,361
Chew it.

1273
01:31:00,921 --> 01:31:03,241
Take a bite!
Take a bite, I say!

1274
01:31:06,401 --> 01:31:07,361
Okay.

1275
01:31:13,721 --> 01:31:16,761
Sir, ever since we've come here,
Mr. Rameshwar has been quiet.

1276
01:31:16,801 --> 01:31:17,801
He is not that type of a man.

1277
01:31:17,841 --> 01:31:19,921
I feel it is the
calm before the storm.

1278
01:31:19,961 --> 01:31:21,241
Please check.

1279
01:31:21,321 --> 01:31:22,561
What does he have to say now?

1280
01:31:23,001 --> 01:31:24,361
We just need to record his statement.

1281
01:31:24,601 --> 01:31:26,601
Until the seal and the prohibitory
orders are revoked

1282
01:31:27,281 --> 01:31:28,601
it would've already been a month.

1283
01:31:28,641 --> 01:31:31,561
Sir, this will be the longest
raid that has taken place

1284
01:31:31,641 --> 01:31:32,801
in the history of the IT department.

1285
01:31:45,721 --> 01:31:47,201
Your statement is still pending.

1286
01:31:48,401 --> 01:31:49,721
We haven't even interrogated you yet.

1287
01:31:50,201 --> 01:31:51,401
You should not drink.

1288
01:31:52,161 --> 01:31:54,561
Even I could be interrogated.

1289
01:31:56,361 --> 01:31:57,881
That's why I'm drinking.

1290
01:32:00,961 --> 01:32:03,641
Heck, one of my own has betrayed me.

1291
01:32:04,081 --> 01:32:05,721
Even you have betrayed
your own people.

1292
01:32:06,241 --> 01:32:08,321
Your country and the citizens.

1293
01:32:08,641 --> 01:32:10,961
Perhaps, that's why your own
are betraying you.

1294
01:32:12,441 --> 01:32:13,481
It's your karma!

1295
01:32:14,241 --> 01:32:15,601
Come on, take a seat, Officer.

1296
01:32:17,801 --> 01:32:20,081
Let's sit down and talk
about deeds and karma.

1297
01:32:22,361 --> 01:32:23,361
Have a seat.

1298
01:32:25,201 --> 01:32:26,641
Sit down now.

1299
01:32:28,161 --> 01:32:31,441
Even in the Mahabharata,
the fight would stop

1300
01:32:32,241 --> 01:32:33,881
after the conch was blown.

1301
01:32:34,961 --> 01:32:36,561
But over here, the conch
has not been blown yet.

1302
01:32:37,241 --> 01:32:40,841
The conch will be blown only
after we leave this house.

1303
01:32:42,961 --> 01:32:44,841
Why are you dreaming?

1304
01:32:46,481 --> 01:32:48,601
Dreams do not come true.

1305
01:32:49,641 --> 01:32:52,161
I agree that it is foolish
to dream. - Yes.

1306
01:32:53,241 --> 01:32:55,521
But if we try to fulfil our dreams

1307
01:32:56,721 --> 01:32:58,241
anything is possible.

1308
01:33:02,121 --> 01:33:04,281
If you're scared
of getting caught

1309
01:33:04,881 --> 01:33:07,041
let me give you a last offer.

1310
01:33:08,281 --> 01:33:09,961
Forget five lakh rupees

1311
01:33:11,361 --> 01:33:13,561
I will give you five lakh dollars.

1312
01:33:15,241 --> 01:33:17,761
It will be transferred
to your Swiss Bank account.

1313
01:33:17,961 --> 01:33:20,601
Nobody would ever know about it.

1314
01:33:20,641 --> 01:33:22,921
Your future generations
will have a lavish life.

1315
01:33:26,521 --> 01:33:28,321
So, you also have an account
in Swiss Bank.

1316
01:33:30,201 --> 01:33:31,801
Now this will be a very long raid!

1317
01:33:36,161 --> 01:33:38,121
What does your honesty get you?

1318
01:33:39,361 --> 01:33:40,801
I sleep well at night.

1319
01:33:41,601 --> 01:33:44,601
Perhaps, you need a peg or two.

1320
01:33:46,521 --> 01:33:48,641
Does your wife wear
the nuptial chain?

1321
01:33:51,921 --> 01:33:53,081
No.

1322
01:33:54,361 --> 01:33:55,761
But her husband is alive.

1323
01:33:57,881 --> 01:33:59,801
I have heard that your wife

1324
01:34:00,401 --> 01:34:02,201
poured kerosene on herself..
- Hey!

1325
01:34:03,681 --> 01:34:06,801
Officer, do not cross your limits.

1326
01:34:08,081 --> 01:34:09,241
Who started it?

1327
01:35:23,681 --> 01:35:27,921
"Rameshwar is enjoying"

1328
01:35:27,961 --> 01:35:32,561
"a ride on the swing."

1329
01:35:33,841 --> 01:35:35,561
Come, Officer.

1330
01:35:36,481 --> 01:35:40,321
You have collected my wealth
by working hard.

1331
01:35:41,161 --> 01:35:42,961
But the question is

1332
01:35:43,721 --> 01:35:45,681
how will you go out?

1333
01:35:46,481 --> 01:35:47,601
Who will stop me?

1334
01:35:50,561 --> 01:35:53,761
Rameshwar's army.

1335
01:36:48,961 --> 01:36:50,801
Brother-in-law, this..

1336
01:36:52,841 --> 01:36:55,041
This is not right, Brother-in-law.

1337
01:36:56,041 --> 01:36:58,321
We need to use force

1338
01:37:00,081 --> 01:37:02,401
when things cannot be done politely.

1339
01:37:04,641 --> 01:37:05,961
Is my breakfast ready?

1340
01:37:07,721 --> 01:37:10,401
What are you doing?
- Hey!

1341
01:37:11,361 --> 01:37:12,641
Down, down!

1342
01:37:12,681 --> 01:37:14,241
All of you, calm down.

1343
01:37:14,281 --> 01:37:16,521
All of you, calm down.
- Down, down!

1344
01:37:16,561 --> 01:37:21,321
Down, down!

1345
01:37:21,841 --> 01:37:24,001
You guys kill
collectors and engineers

1346
01:37:24,041 --> 01:37:25,281
on the say of the politicians.

1347
01:37:25,561 --> 01:37:27,721
This money does not belong
to me or my dad.

1348
01:37:28,081 --> 01:37:29,561
This money belongs
to all of you.

1349
01:37:30,321 --> 01:37:32,721
We are taking this
for your own good.

1350
01:37:32,761 --> 01:37:34,201
Down, down!

1351
01:37:34,281 --> 01:37:36,121
This black money is obtained
by duping people like you

1352
01:37:36,201 --> 01:37:37,521
and by accepting bribes.

1353
01:37:37,561 --> 01:37:38,561
Down, down!

1354
01:37:38,601 --> 01:37:40,001
Do not support them.

1355
01:37:40,041 --> 01:37:41,521
All this is a lie.

1356
01:37:41,601 --> 01:37:43,721
Please..
Please listen to me.

1357
01:37:43,761 --> 01:37:45,921
This is your plan
to trap Mr. Rameshwar.

1358
01:37:46,361 --> 01:37:47,681
Down, down!

1359
01:37:48,481 --> 01:37:51,561
Down, down!

1360
01:37:51,641 --> 01:37:53,161
Down, down!

1361
01:37:53,201 --> 01:37:54,961
Down, down!

1362
01:37:56,121 --> 01:37:57,761
All of you, calm down.

1363
01:37:57,801 --> 01:38:00,441
They are entering our bedrooms.
They are entering the temple.

1364
01:37:57,801 --> 01:38:00,441
They are entering our bedrooms.
They are entering the temple.

1365
01:38:00,521 --> 01:38:01,281
Quiet..
- How can we let them go?

1366
01:38:01,361 --> 01:38:04,161
We'll make you parade naked
if you try to harm us.

1367
01:38:04,201 --> 01:38:06,001
Don't let anybody from the team
step out of the house.

1368
01:38:06,721 --> 01:38:08,281
Stay away from the crowd
as much as possible.

1369
01:38:09,281 --> 01:38:10,841
What happened, Patnaik?

1370
01:38:12,041 --> 01:38:13,881
You were talking about
the sections of the law

1371
01:38:13,921 --> 01:38:15,361
when you came here.

1372
01:38:16,321 --> 01:38:18,841
Tell me under which section
I will booked

1373
01:38:18,881 --> 01:38:20,321
before going from here

1374
01:38:21,041 --> 01:38:25,441
when this crowd lynches all of you.

1375
01:38:30,321 --> 01:38:32,681
The crowd has never been

1376
01:38:33,241 --> 01:38:36,361
punished in this country.
Do you know that?

1377
01:38:38,401 --> 01:38:41,961
All of you will die
a cruel death.

1378
01:38:49,361 --> 01:38:50,841
Open the door.

1379
01:39:03,761 --> 01:39:04,841
Open the door.

1380
01:39:05,961 --> 01:39:07,361
All of you, come with me.
Come.

1381
01:39:07,401 --> 01:39:08,601
Come, let's go.

1382
01:39:08,641 --> 01:39:10,601
Hey, where are you going?

1383
01:39:18,641 --> 01:39:20,281
Come.
- Come quickly.

1384
01:39:20,361 --> 01:39:21,361
Come.

1385
01:39:24,161 --> 01:39:26,321
Come quickly.
- Come.

1386
01:39:29,081 --> 01:39:31,201
Mr. Patnaik, what is our fault?

1387
01:39:31,241 --> 01:39:32,721
We were just doing our duty.

1388
01:39:35,681 --> 01:39:36,801
We'll have to leave from here
as soon as possible.

1389
01:39:36,841 --> 01:39:37,681
How can we go, Mr. Patnaik?

1390
01:39:37,721 --> 01:39:39,161
We have recovered the amount
with great difficulty.

1391
01:39:39,201 --> 01:39:40,761
We'll lose all the evidence
if we leave from here.

1392
01:39:41,201 --> 01:39:42,281
Do you guys want to die?

1393
01:39:42,601 --> 01:39:44,561
I had checked all the exit
routes during the survey.

1394
01:39:44,961 --> 01:39:46,441
A road towards the backside
leads to the jungle.

1395
01:39:46,961 --> 01:39:48,881
You guys go and save yourselves.
Go.

1396
01:39:53,561 --> 01:39:54,761
Please come.

1397
01:39:54,841 --> 01:39:57,881
This way.
Come.

1398
01:40:13,081 --> 01:40:16,841
Go that way.
- Come quickly.

1399
01:40:24,961 --> 01:40:26,321
Hey, there they are!

1400
01:40:27,481 --> 01:40:28,641
Get down.

1401
01:40:47,081 --> 01:40:48,761
Sir.
- Come this way.

1402
01:41:17,801 --> 01:41:20,481
The officer has left.

1403
01:41:20,521 --> 01:41:23,121
It's time to find out
who the Vibhishana is.

1404
01:41:23,921 --> 01:41:25,081
Who is it?

1405
01:41:26,121 --> 01:41:27,881
Forget this.

1406
01:41:28,641 --> 01:41:30,761
Tell me, is it a male
or a female?

1407
01:41:34,241 --> 01:41:35,241
Come on.
- Go quickly.

1408
01:41:35,601 --> 01:41:36,881
Where is Mr. Patnaik going?

1409
01:41:37,681 --> 01:41:38,761
Mr. Patnaik.
- Mr. Patnaik.

1410
01:41:40,801 --> 01:41:42,321
We should have realised this
earlier, Mr. Patnaik.

1411
01:41:42,521 --> 01:41:43,401
What are you doing?

1412
01:41:43,441 --> 01:41:45,161
Will you stay here
after saving all of us?

1413
01:41:45,401 --> 01:41:46,721
There's a highway ahead.

1414
01:41:47,601 --> 01:41:49,401
Go and try to ask
for help there.

1415
01:41:49,601 --> 01:41:50,721
No, Mr. Patnaik.
We cannot leave you alone.

1416
01:41:50,761 --> 01:41:51,641
We cannot leave you alone.

1417
01:41:51,721 --> 01:41:54,481
I had promised not to put
your lives at risk.

1418
01:41:55,161 --> 01:41:56,561
Lallan, don't make me fail
to deliver on the promise.

1419
01:41:56,881 --> 01:41:59,281
Please, leave.
- Sir, we can't abandon you.

1420
01:41:59,321 --> 01:42:01,241
Leave, Lallan!
I will meet you later! Leave!

1421
01:41:59,321 --> 01:42:01,241
Leave, Lallan!
I will meet you later! Leave!

1422
01:42:01,681 --> 01:42:02,681
Leave.

1423
01:42:09,601 --> 01:42:12,481
You are a tough nut to crack, sir.

1424
01:42:13,121 --> 01:42:15,921
You have returned here to die.

1425
01:42:21,961 --> 01:42:26,041
I wish my family members
were honest like him.

1426
01:42:31,241 --> 01:42:32,161
Stay here.

1427
01:42:38,961 --> 01:42:40,321
Hey!
Where do you think

1428
01:42:40,361 --> 01:42:41,321
you are going?

1429
01:42:41,361 --> 01:42:43,601
He has gone to the backyard.
Nab him!

1430
01:42:44,441 --> 01:42:45,481
Wait!

1431
01:42:46,481 --> 01:42:48,401
These are all pawns.

1432
01:42:49,481 --> 01:42:50,841
Their leader is right there.

1433
01:42:51,961 --> 01:42:54,001
I want him

1434
01:42:54,721 --> 01:42:57,561
dead or alive.

1435
01:43:37,641 --> 01:43:40,401
Sir, let's sprinkle kerosene oil
in the room and set it on fire.

1436
01:44:05,801 --> 01:44:12,561
"I have no qualms even if I die."

1437
01:44:13,641 --> 01:44:20,401
"Look at my courage."

1438
01:44:21,281 --> 01:44:27,961
"You don't have the guts
to scare me."

1439
01:44:28,841 --> 01:44:35,561
"O world! Listen to my decision."

1440
01:44:37,201 --> 01:44:43,601
"I will not bow down
even if I die."

1441
01:44:45,241 --> 01:44:50,721
"I will not bow down
even if I die."

1442
01:45:38,561 --> 01:45:44,881
"Until there is blood
flowing in my veins"

1443
01:45:46,241 --> 01:45:52,881
"all your weapons are useless."

1444
01:45:53,161 --> 01:46:00,841
"I agree that even my
shadow has left me."

1445
01:45:53,161 --> 01:46:00,841
"I agree that even my
shadow has left me."

1446
01:46:00,921 --> 01:46:08,601
"But my God is still with me."

1447
01:46:08,841 --> 01:46:15,281
"The twigs of conscience
aren't so less"

1448
01:46:16,521 --> 01:46:22,921
"that they can't
build a nest again."

1449
01:46:24,161 --> 01:46:31,201
"You don't have the guts
to scare me."

1450
01:46:31,721 --> 01:46:39,041
"O world! Listen to my decision."

1451
01:46:41,281 --> 01:46:43,321
Are they safe?
- Yes, ma'am. - Good.

1452
01:46:43,361 --> 01:46:44,641
We have rescued them
at the right time.

1453
01:46:45,481 --> 01:46:47,721
We need officers like Mr. Patnaik.

1454
01:46:47,961 --> 01:46:49,401
Yes, ma'am.
- People like them

1455
01:46:49,481 --> 01:46:51,201
help us run the economy smoothly.

1456
01:46:51,641 --> 01:46:54,641
We can sacrifice Mr. Rameshwar
for the greater good.

1457
01:46:57,961 --> 01:46:59,481
Revenue is the backbone
of administration.

1458
01:47:00,441 --> 01:47:03,681
Your riches exceed your army.

1459
01:47:04,241 --> 01:47:05,681
Do you understand me,
Mr. Rameshwar Singh?

1460
01:47:09,841 --> 01:47:11,641
Now that it's over

1461
01:47:12,441 --> 01:47:16,841
please tell me who sold me out.

1462
01:47:18,121 --> 01:47:19,241
It was one of your family members.

1463
01:47:19,961 --> 01:47:21,761
But it's not your servant Mr. Ramu.

1464
01:47:22,801 --> 01:47:24,641
I'm not allowed to reveal his name.

1465
01:47:32,721 --> 01:47:39,761
"I am a burning flame
in the middle of a storm."

1466
01:47:40,481 --> 01:47:47,881
"I am that moment
which fights against time."

1467
01:48:04,921 --> 01:48:06,881
Vibhishana..

1468
01:48:09,681 --> 01:48:11,761
Vibhishana?

1469
01:48:15,281 --> 01:48:17,961
This is not done.
Won't you even tell me?

1470
01:48:18,881 --> 01:48:21,601
Who was the informer?
Please tell me.

1471
01:48:24,081 --> 01:48:25,201
I can't reveal his name to you.

1472
01:48:26,641 --> 01:48:28,161
Rules are applicable to everyone.

1473
01:48:33,681 --> 01:48:35,881
'Hello.
- I have an information for you.'

1474
01:48:36,241 --> 01:48:37,401
'Take the offertory.'

1475
01:48:45,041 --> 01:48:46,961
'You will be rewarded.
- I will treat'

1476
01:48:47,041 --> 01:48:48,641
'Tara and my revenge
as my reward.'

1477
01:48:52,641 --> 01:48:54,561
'Sir, we loved each
other very much.'

1478
01:48:55,881 --> 01:49:00,161
'But Mr. Singh got her married
to his good-for-nothing son'

1479
01:48:55,881 --> 01:49:00,161
'But Mr. Singh got her married
to his good-for-nothing son'

1480
01:49:00,721 --> 01:49:02,121
'under a political agreement.'

1481
01:49:06,521 --> 01:49:10,081
'Mr. Singh had threatened
to kill the informer'

1482
01:49:11,201 --> 01:49:13,161
'if he came to know about him.'

1483
01:49:13,241 --> 01:49:15,921
'Don't worry.
Until Tara is alive'

1484
01:49:16,641 --> 01:49:18,001
'I won't disclose the secret.'

1485
01:49:19,201 --> 01:49:20,281
'You have my word.'

1486
01:49:27,961 --> 01:49:29,681
I have received my transfer order.

1487
01:49:30,561 --> 01:49:32,401
The responsibility now
rests upon your shoulders.

1488
01:49:33,961 --> 01:49:35,281
All the best.
- Thank you.

1489
01:49:39,361 --> 01:49:46,041
"The twigs of conscience
aren't so less"

1490
01:49:47,081 --> 01:49:54,161
"that they can't
build a nest again."

1491
01:49:54,601 --> 01:50:01,801

1492

"You don't have

1493
01:50:02,321 --> 01:50:09,521
"O world!
Listen to my decision."

1494
01:50:10,961 --> 01:50:18,641
"I will not bow down
even if I die."

1495
01:50:18,681 --> 01:50:24,361
"I will not bow down
even if I die."

1496
01:50:26,441 --> 01:50:33,601
"I will not bow down
even if I die."

1497
