1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500


3
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:21,125
Saeed, did you find him?

4
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:34,750
Viraj is not here.

5
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:38,750
Only his jacket's here.

6
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:46,583
I think we've lost him.

7
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:04,916
An average of 86 and a strike rate of 155.

8
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:10,583
If anybody can help India clinch the victory, it's this player.

9
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:14,583
Viraj Sharma.

10
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:30,416
Has it got the distance?

11
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:33,875
Yes, it has! Six for Viraj, six for India!

12
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,291
Can't help but get reminded of Sachin Tendulkar..

13
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:39,250
..in the 1998 Coca Cola Cup at this very venue.

14
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,458
Now five runs required of just two balls.

15
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:47,583
This is gonna be another one of those Viraj Sharma specials.

16
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:51,708
There's a fielder in the deep, Viraj needs to keep strike to himself.

17
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:54,583
He's challenging the fielder, challenging his arm.

18
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:57,416
It's going to be tight. It is tight.

19
00:05:57,916 --> 00:06:01,125
Umpire signals upstairs. Third umpire it is now.

20
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:02,333
And..

21
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:06,000
Is he in? Just about it seems.

22
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,000
Viraj Sharma isn't getting up.

23
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,958
I think we've got a problem here.

24
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:15,250
And it looks very much like he's in a lot of pain.

25
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:19,416
I think that he jammed his shoulder due to the dive.

26
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:23,416
Look at that right arm. There's a problem there, he's struggling.

27
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:32,041
Viraj is walking off the field.

28
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:34,250
This is bad news for India.

29
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,333
This is India's last wicket. If Viraj doesn't return..

30
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:42,416
..then Sri Lanka will move into the finals and play Pakistan.

31
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:44,916
It's paining really bad though. - What happened?

32
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:47,333
My shoulder.. I think it's dislocated.

33
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:49,291
We'll inform them that you can't play.

34
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:50,791
Give me a minute, sir.

35
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:53,750
This happened to me during the under-19 world cup too.

36
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,125
I think I can fix this.

37
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:59,125
Don't be stupid, Viraj. Your career is at stake.

38
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:19,833
Give me the bat.

39
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,583
Even an injury can't keep Viraj away from cricket.

40
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:35,291
This is the mark of a true champion.

41
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:39,291
So here it is, the final ball that decides everything.

42
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:52,750
That's a switch hit. Oh yes!

43
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,625
What a shot, what a player, what a match!

44
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:58,625
Winning a lost match has become Viraj's habit off late.

45
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:02,458
I guess that's why they call him Mr. Impossible.

46
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:06,166
So there it is. Exactly after 48 hours..

47
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:08,375
..India will clash against Pakistan in the final.

48
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:13,041
C'mon!

49
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:14,166
That's it from us.

50
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:18,166
We'll see you at the Sheikh Hamza stadium. Goodnight.

51
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:38,000
C'mon! -Well played!

52
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:42,625
C'mon, boys! Faster! Faster! Faster, guys!

53
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:45,000
Viraj is not in his room. - Must be having breakfast.

54
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,041
No, sir. His bed is untouched as well.

55
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:48,708
As if he didn't return to the room.

56
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:52,708
Did you try calling him? -His phone is unreachable, sir.

57
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,125
Since when?

58
00:08:58,625 --> 00:08:59,791
Haven't spoken to him since last night.

59
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:03,875
Tell me something, does he often break curfew rules?

60
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:08,083
In fact, he never does it. He's one of our most disciplined boys.

61
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:10,333
That's why I'm even more worried.

62
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:12,625
Even his phone is switched off.

63
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:15,708
That's strange, this has never happened before.

64
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:17,583
Have you spoken to Viraj's family?

65
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:20,250
His father spoke to him yesterday, after the game.

66
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:23,541
India plays Pakistan in 36 hours.

67
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:26,375
No one should get a whiff of this.

68
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:28,208
This news can cause riots.

69
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:30,916
So ma'am, what's our next step?

70
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:32,750
Whether it's Viraj Sharma or a substitute..

71
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,291
..we're responsible for the safety of the whole team.

72
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:37,583
Bring back the whole team on the next flight.

73
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:41,333
We'll have to cancel the finals.

74
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:43,541
Connect me to their foreign affairs minister.

75
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:47,541
Yes, ma'am.

76
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:17,041
Pakistan.. Pakistan..

77
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:21,041
Pakistan.. Pakistan..

78
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,416
Hello!

79
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:31,458
This is for the governments of India and the Gulf states.

80
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:35,125
Since you don't know me, consider me a fan.

81
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:39,291
Don't even bother to find me, I'm not from your country.

82
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:41,166
Anyway, listen carefully now.

83
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,666
I don't want any money or ransom.

84
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:46,666
This is just..

85
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:49,666
..for the love of my cricket team.

86
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:51,916
A small request.

87
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:54,958
The final match..

88
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:57,250
..will be played without this Viraj Sharma.

89
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,541
I'll send him home after that.

90
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:04,250
God forbid, if I come to know that..

91
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:08,250
..the final match is cancelled..

92
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:24,875
If the final is cancelled..

93
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:29,875
..I'll kill him.

94
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:33,541
It's just a matter of 36 hours.

95
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:38,291
Let him stay here.

96
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:42,291
Pakistan.. Pakistan..

97
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:52,166
India's Minister of External Affairs is on line 1.

98
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:54,291
I'm guessing, you've seen the video.

99
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:56,875
We've been promoting cricket for ages.

100
00:11:57,375 --> 00:12:01,083
But such an incident has never happened in our country before.

101
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:03,208
We're dealing with a fanatical fan here.

102
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:05,416
This man's crazy, he can do anything.

103
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:06,916
We need to act fast.

104
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:10,250
Ma'am, I promise you, my best men will be on the job.

105
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,000
I have a request. I want to send an officer from India..

106
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,666
..who will help you on this case.

107
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:19,083
I don't think that is necessary. Our working styles are different.

108
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:23,958
Don't worry about that. His working style is very unique.

109
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:27,958
He'll be there by lunch.

110
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:43,875
I just asked you not to smoke in the lift.

111
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:52,041
I gave you an option of taking the stairs.

112
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:54,416
Customs officer Vishal Sinha, how are you?

113
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:57,041
I'm fine, buddy. Just thought of talking to you.

114
00:12:57,541 --> 00:13:00,166
Of course, you'll think of me. We used to kill thugs together.

115
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:02,333
Now you wear a white cap and check excess baggage.

116
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,166
Shall we catch up for lunch?

117
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:05,791
Can't. I've come to meet Alishka.

118
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:08,875
Good. Atleast you found time for her.

119
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:12,875
Take care, man.

120
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:17,291
Coming!

121
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:19,916
Sorry, Kabir. I was in the bathroom.

122
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:21,541
What time is the flight?

123
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:24,291
3.30 am. I hate early morning flights.

124
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:28,291
- Where are you going? - Brussels.

125
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:42,625
Please don't smoke here, Kabir.

126
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:44,875
'No-smoking' here as well?

127
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:47,166
Stop being an airhostess everywhere, Alishka.

128
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:49,833
Don't smoke, it's killing you.

129
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:53,125
When bullets couldn't kill me, how can the cigarettes?

130
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:57,583
All I'm saying is, don't keep finding ways to kill yourself.

131
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:01,625
That's why I come to you.

132
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:05,625
A glimmer of life in the darkness of death.

133
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:19,333
- Where is he? - Who?

134
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:22,125
The one who is hiding in this house.

135
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:23,458
What are you talking about?

136
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:26,000
Sometimes you forget that I'm a cop.

137
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:31,291
And sometimes you forget, this is a house. Not your crime scene.

138
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:34,458
There steam on the bathroom mirror, someone's taken a shower recently.

139
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,750
But your hair is dry.

140
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:40,750
And the toilet seat is up.

141
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:43,416
Is he in the wardrobe?

142
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,166
- Who, Kabir? - Who is it?

143
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:46,708
Have you lost it?

144
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:49,791
Will you open the wardrobe or will he walk out on his own?

145
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:52,375
I'll count to three.

146
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:55,916
If you don't step out, I will..

147
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:57,458
..shoot Alishka.

148
00:14:57,958 --> 00:14:59,791
- Kabir, put the gun down. - One!

149
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:01,041
You've gone mad.

150
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:02,791
- You've lost it, Kabir. - Two!

151
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:05,166
Listen to me. You're freaking me out.

152
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:09,166
Three.

153
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:16,250
Customs officer Vishal Sinha. How are you?

154
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:17,375
I'm sorry, man.

155
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,208
We worked together for three years.

156
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:21,916
I took a bullet for you.

157
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:25,875
Kabir, please.. Listen to me, all this was an accident.

158
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:28,083
Accident? Did you fall?

159
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:30,791
Your pants fell down? What else happened by accident?

160
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:33,041
We can talk about this, Kabir.

161
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:36,833
It's not Vishal's fault.

162
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:40,833
She's the only one who has never betrayed me.

163
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:05,541
Don't worry, no metal on me.

164
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:09,541
He's with us.

165
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:15,250
Kabir Shergill, special task force.

166
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,875
Saeed Naqvi. You'll be working with me on this case.

167
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:23,416
- Your bag? - I've got my deodorant.

168
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:26,208
- You must be hungry. - I'm good.

169
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:30,125
No smoking in a police vehicle.

170
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:31,875
Drive to the Indian team's hotel.

171
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,875
Sorry, you'll have to go to the headquarters first, for a briefing.

172
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:36,791
Hotel first and then the headquarters.

173
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:40,166
Sorry, but this is the protocol. I can't..

174
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,208
I've come here to find Viraj Sharma.

175
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:44,541
I don't have time for your protocols.

176
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:47,583
Tell him where to go.

177
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:51,583
Viceroy hotel.

178
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:06,166
This guy is trouble.

179
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:14,958
Since you don't know me, consider me a fan.

180
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:16,916
I don't want any money or ransom.

181
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:21,083
This is just out of love for my cricket team.

182
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,250
If the final is cancelled..

183
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,166
..I'll kill him.

184
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:28,166
It's just a matter of 36 hours.

185
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:30,750
Let him stay here.

186
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,750
You have to rescue Viraj within the next 36 hours.

187
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,333
And you've to show the perpetrators..

188
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:39,000
..that nobody, in any part of the world..

189
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:43,000
..can harm an Indian.

190
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:02,125
Kabir.

191
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:05,333
You shouldn't have misbehaved with my officer.

192
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:09,916
Any information about the kidnapper?

193
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:12,291
I spoke to the Pakistani consulate and ministry.

194
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:14,166
This man is not in their records.

195
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:17,458
We only know that this video was shot in either an old school..

196
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:19,875
..or the janitor room of a hospital.

197
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:23,875
Anything else?

198
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:27,458
The hotel's CCTV footage has just come in.

199
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:31,791
The car belongs to this girl. Samaira Dalal. She's a local.

200
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:34,291
That means, Viraj is probably still in the city.

201
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:36,375
We'll have to interrogate that girl.

202
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:39,041
I'll handle that. But there's a problem.

203
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:41,791
- What? - Saeed.

204
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:43,416
I don't understand.

205
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:47,416
I need a guide, not a partner.

206
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:59,291
- What is it? - I picked up the kids from school..

207
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:00,750
..and dropped madam at the Yoga centre.

208
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,083
Broccoli was out of stock, so I got cauliflower instead.

209
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:06,125
I've kept the baby powder in the car. White for you and pink for ma'am.

210
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:07,916
But..

211
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:12,416
..your anti-itch balm was out of stock.

212
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:17,791
- Shall I go? - Yes, please.

213
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:22,166
- Hey! - You're talking to me?

214
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:23,125
Indian?

215
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:25,291
I earn in Dirhams, but spend in Rupees.

216
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:27,458
I serve them but obey only Mr. Modi.

217
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,291
- Do you speak Arabic? - I was born in Bhendi Bazaar.

218
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:32,375
But I grew up near Burj Khalifa.

219
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:34,416
I can speak enough Arabic to manage their household.

220
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:35,708
Familiar with the city?

221
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,458
Junaid has just passed out from the academy.

222
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:40,291
He couldn't even find a missing dog in two months.

223
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:41,541
Because of that dog..

224
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:43,875
..I know every nook and corner of this city.

225
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:46,375
Go and start the car, I'll join you.

226
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:48,541
I'm not a driver.

227
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:52,625
Say it politely.

228
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:57,416
Saeed, message me the address. I'll take him there.

229
00:19:57,916 --> 00:20:00,208
What the hell are you doing? Junaid is just a rookie!

230
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:04,208
He has no field experience.

231
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:14,291
Perfect.

232
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:17,000
And the laws that I'm going to break during this case..

233
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:21,000
..I apologise for that in advance.

234
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:26,333
Sir, how could you allow that?

235
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:50,541
For the first time, someone has appreciated..

236
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,916
..my knowledge of the city and multilingual skills.

237
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:54,333
Hi, Junaid.

238
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,916
If we become buddies in future, then you can call me J.

239
00:20:57,416 --> 00:20:58,291
Kabir.

240
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,250
So K.. what do you do?

241
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,791
Special Task Force, India.

242
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:04,208
Tough!

243
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:06,416
How come here? Shopping festival?

244
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:07,541
Drive faster.

245
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:10,458
Sorry, how can a cop break the rules?

246
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:12,291
Pull over, I'll drive.

247
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:15,750
You didn't get me, if you overspeed, I'll have to arrest you.

248
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:19,416
But the good news is that there's no restriction on loud music.

249
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:21,375
"..I guzzle down four."

250
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:23,333
"Four bottles of vodka.."

251
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:25,250
"..my daily affair."

252
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,208
"Nobody stops me."

253
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:29,000
"Nobody can stop me."

254
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,291
"Drinking all night, lemonade in the morning."

255
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,291
"That's the story of every party animal."

256
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:35,291
"Drink to your fill."

257
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:37,166
"Say hello to any girl you want."

258
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:39,041
"Hello baby, how do you do?"

259
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:41,000
"Hold on a second, girl!"

260
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,791
"I don't know why.."

261
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:45,458
"..nobody comes with me to the club."

262
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:47,625
What the..!

263
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:50,041
You punched Honey Singh, but why?

264
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:52,625
- I don't like this song. - You could've told me.

265
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:54,750
Why did you break my music system?

266
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,750
Drive quietly or I'll have to break many things here.

267
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,291
Let's clear this now.

268
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:01,416
Which songs provoke the 'Tyson' in you?

269
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:02,666
All of them.

270
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:06,791
Except classical ones.

271
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:10,791
In my opinion, Mika and Honey are evergreen. Don't judge me, I like them.

272
00:22:40,666 --> 00:22:40,958
Yes?

273
00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:42,250
Kabir Shergill, police department.

274
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,625
- I've some questions for you. - Regarding what?

275
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:46,583
Junaid Ansari, same mission.

276
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:48,916
Ok. Can I get you boys something to drink?

277
00:22:49,416 --> 00:22:51,583
Actually, we're on duty.

278
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:52,958
I didn't mean that.

279
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:55,083
We're good.

280
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:57,458
Viraj Sharma left in your car last night.

281
00:22:57,958 --> 00:22:59,791
And when he returned to his room..

282
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:02,208
..both his phone and wallet were missing.

283
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:06,208
So we want to know..

284
00:23:09,208 --> 00:23:13,250
So, we want to know what happened last night.

285
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:17,250
I saw Viraj while leaving the hotel.

286
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:25,083
- Viraj, hey! - Hi.

287
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:27,583
Actually, it is my best friend's birthday today.

288
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:29,833
She is a huge fan of yours.

289
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:33,833
Can I get a picture with you, just for her.

290
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:41,958
- Whoa, that's hot! - Thanks.

291
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:45,958
- I was talking about that car. - Me too. It's mine. You wanna ride?

292
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:06,125
I don't mean to disrespect.

293
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:11,333
But I have never touched anything more beautiful than this.

294
00:24:11,833 --> 00:24:14,875
Guess who I am with, Viraj Sharma.

295
00:24:15,375 --> 00:24:19,750
Nothing, just going for a spin. Yes, coming in ten minutes.

296
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,041
Wanna come for her birthday party?

297
00:24:21,541 --> 00:24:23,458
No, I can't. I've to be back at the hotel by midnight.

298
00:24:23,958 --> 00:24:25,750
Oh please, just five minutes.

299
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:29,750
She'll freak out. C'mon, do it for a fan.

300
00:24:50,125 --> 00:24:50,666
That's her.

301
00:24:51,166 --> 00:24:52,666
Thank you.

302
00:24:53,166 --> 00:24:55,250
Oh my god! I can't believe this.

303
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,583
I'm such a big fan, Viraj.

304
00:24:58,083 --> 00:24:59,583
Like, I love you!

305
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:00,375
Happy birthday.

306
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:03,791
And Sam, you're the world's best friend.

307
00:25:04,291 --> 00:25:05,291
Viraj, listen up now.

308
00:25:05,791 --> 00:25:07,666
We have to kill it in the finals this time.

309
00:25:08,166 --> 00:25:09,791
Just be careful with your hook shot.

310
00:25:10,291 --> 00:25:13,791
Sure.

311
00:25:14,291 --> 00:25:16,291
No, I'm good.

312
00:25:16,791 --> 00:25:18,958
Viraj, I'll just use the loo, then we can leave.

313
00:25:19,458 --> 00:25:22,625
- Cool, I'll wait near the car. - Ok.

314
00:25:23,125 --> 00:25:26,625
He's so cute.

315
00:25:28,625 --> 00:25:31,041
And when I came out, he wasn't there.

316
00:25:31,541 --> 00:25:32,375
How did he get to the hotel?

317
00:25:32,875 --> 00:25:35,416
He took a cab.

318
00:25:35,916 --> 00:25:39,416
These are the suspects.

319
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,416
Was any of them present in the party?

320
00:25:44,916 --> 00:25:47,208
I didn't see.

321
00:25:47,708 --> 00:25:49,958
Sorry, this is a bit off the topic.

322
00:25:50,458 --> 00:25:53,416
I have a photo too, have you seen him somewhere?

323
00:25:53,916 --> 00:25:56,375
I haven't, but maybe Brutus has.

324
00:25:56,875 --> 00:25:58,750
What's the use? He won't be able to tell us.

325
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:01,791
Ok, officers, I hope I was of some help.

326
00:26:02,291 --> 00:26:08,166
It's shower time for me and Brutus.

327
00:26:08,666 --> 00:26:12,166
Brutus has such a great life!

328
00:26:15,166 --> 00:26:19,083
The captain was right, you're only fit to run errands.

329
00:26:19,583 --> 00:26:22,250
According to standard procedure, we must first talk to the victim.

330
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,208
But we went to the suspect first.

331
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,875
Are you sure the victim's not missing?

332
00:26:27,375 --> 00:26:29,625
You're not as stupid as you appear to be.

333
00:26:30,125 --> 00:26:32,708
And you couldn't live up to your grumpy image.

334
00:26:33,208 --> 00:26:35,041
But what's with the photos in the phone?

335
00:26:35,541 --> 00:26:41,750
If you let me drive, I'll explain everything to you.

336
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:44,041
Shit! Viraj Sharma has been kidnapped?!

337
00:26:44,541 --> 00:26:45,541
I don't watch much of cricket..

338
00:26:46,041 --> 00:26:47,458
..but I've heard, Miss India is dating him.

339
00:26:47,958 --> 00:26:49,458
He must be in form. With the finals tomorrow..

340
00:26:49,958 --> 00:26:53,458
..Pakistan's got lucky.

341
00:26:57,708 --> 00:26:59,458
There's no chance that Viraj hailed a cab from here.

342
00:26:59,958 --> 00:27:02,208
Athletes are much stronger than normal people.

343
00:27:02,708 --> 00:27:04,375
One man alone can't kidnap him.

344
00:27:04,875 --> 00:27:07,458
There's a man who knows about a sham, even before it happens.

345
00:27:07,958 --> 00:27:08,958
Is he useful?

346
00:27:09,458 --> 00:27:12,250
Who found out Osama's Abbottabad address? That too, from the milkman.

347
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,750
Who exposed India's 2G scam?

348
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:15,833
Who?

349
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:18,250
Uncle Bond.

350
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:21,375
Had America answered his phone on September 10th..

351
00:27:21,875 --> 00:27:25,375
..then September 11th would have never happened.

352
00:27:28,458 --> 00:27:29,375
Greetings, uncle.

353
00:27:29,875 --> 00:27:31,625
What's up, my boy!

354
00:27:32,125 --> 00:27:33,083
How are you?

355
00:27:33,583 --> 00:27:37,708
He's my new crony.. I mean, partner.

356
00:27:38,208 --> 00:27:39,583
Kabir Shergill.

357
00:27:40,083 --> 00:27:42,916
Special Task Force. - How do you know?

358
00:27:43,416 --> 00:27:45,958
Anjum, two cups of Kewah!

359
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:47,041
You'll have Kewah, right?

360
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:49,750
Indian cricketer Viraj Sharma's phone and wallet is missing.

361
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:54,416
He had some important documents in it.

362
00:27:54,916 --> 00:27:59,000
The Indian government has sent a Special Task Force officer..

363
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:03,750
..to search for a wallet?

364
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:06,291
Kewah's here!

365
00:28:06,791 --> 00:28:08,750
Do you know anything about Viraj?

366
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:11,583
Why do I think that..

367
00:28:12,083 --> 00:28:16,291
..Viraj is also missing along with his wallet.

368
00:28:16,791 --> 00:28:18,708
Kabir.

369
00:28:19,208 --> 00:28:20,083
Look, Uncle.

370
00:28:20,583 --> 00:28:22,541
I have widowed many aunts.

371
00:28:23,041 --> 00:28:25,125
Junaid, tell him!

372
00:28:25,625 --> 00:28:29,125
I can't.

373
00:28:35,375 --> 00:28:37,250
This is the Bronx of the Arabs, boy.

374
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,833
Only the street-smart can act smart here.

375
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:41,291
Not cops.

376
00:28:41,791 --> 00:28:43,708
In the desperation to find Viraj..

377
00:28:44,208 --> 00:28:46,375
..don't end up losing yourself.

378
00:28:46,875 --> 00:28:50,375
Take care.

379
00:29:17,583 --> 00:29:21,083
What's going on here?

380
00:29:22,791 --> 00:29:24,375
My apologies, son.

381
00:29:24,875 --> 00:29:26,958
This is the problem with chicks.

382
00:29:27,458 --> 00:29:28,291
Trust them..

383
00:29:28,791 --> 00:29:30,833
..and they'll surely cheat on you.

384
00:29:31,333 --> 00:29:31,541
What?!

385
00:29:32,041 --> 00:29:32,916
He's apologising.

386
00:29:33,416 --> 00:29:35,458
Uncle didn't know that your girlfriend cheated on you.

387
00:29:35,958 --> 00:29:37,791
I didn't understand one thing.

388
00:29:38,291 --> 00:29:40,083
Are you the informer or him?

389
00:29:40,583 --> 00:29:43,583
- Kabir.. - Found your man.

390
00:29:44,083 --> 00:29:44,416
Cheers!

391
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:46,750
- Who is he? - Sameer Ghazi.

392
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:48,541
The biggest party animal of this city.

393
00:29:49,041 --> 00:29:50,458
The girls here..

394
00:29:50,958 --> 00:29:53,041
..are very fond of him.

395
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:54,875
But..

396
00:29:55,375 --> 00:29:57,583
..he's not interested.

397
00:29:58,083 --> 00:30:00,291
"I wanna see you on the dance floor."

398
00:30:00,791 --> 00:30:03,125
"Shaking a bunch of, want it some more."

399
00:30:03,625 --> 00:30:04,958
"Turn on the radio."

400
00:30:05,458 --> 00:30:08,541
"I love you."

401
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:12,125
"I love you selflessly."

402
00:30:12,625 --> 00:30:15,791
"Come into my arms, dear.."

403
00:30:16,291 --> 00:30:18,708
"..just for tonight."

404
00:30:19,208 --> 00:30:22,708
"Before dawn arrives.."

405
00:30:44,958 --> 00:30:47,250
"Before dawn arrives.."

406
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,958
Kabir, this isn't the Wild West, you can't just open fire.

407
00:30:50,458 --> 00:30:52,208
What's your problem with this song anyway?

408
00:30:52,708 --> 00:30:55,375
Nobody plays classical songs in a pool party.

409
00:30:55,875 --> 00:30:58,250
You scared the boys unnecessarily.

410
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:01,875
Why this bang-bang?

411
00:31:02,375 --> 00:31:04,166
I hate violence.

412
00:31:04,666 --> 00:31:05,833
Police!

413
00:31:06,333 --> 00:31:07,166
Go on, partner.

414
00:31:07,666 --> 00:31:10,166
You recently tweeted a photo with the cricketer Viraj Sharma.

415
00:31:10,666 --> 00:31:11,833
How and where did you meet him?

416
00:31:12,333 --> 00:31:13,583
Why?

417
00:31:14,083 --> 00:31:14,916
Jealous?

418
00:31:15,416 --> 00:31:17,625
His phone and wallet are missing. And you're a suspect.

419
00:31:18,125 --> 00:31:18,708
Come out now.

420
00:31:19,208 --> 00:31:22,250
Step into the pool if you want answers.

421
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,166
I don't have time for this shit.

422
00:31:24,666 --> 00:31:26,000
After such a grand entry..

423
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:30,958
..you can't leave without getting wet, inspector? Come in.

424
00:31:31,458 --> 00:31:36,875
C'mon, get a little wet.

425
00:31:37,375 --> 00:31:40,125
I think he knows something. Go for it.

426
00:31:40,625 --> 00:31:42,625
Stop.

427
00:31:43,125 --> 00:31:49,250
Take off your clothes. You'll dirty my pool.

428
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:51,750
You too, little boy.

429
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:55,833
- I'm not a little boy. - You're my little boy.

430
00:31:56,333 --> 00:31:59,833
C'mon, both of you.

431
00:32:00,333 --> 00:32:02,000
I'm sorry that I read your messages.

432
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:06,291
Sorry, but I'm going to break your face very soon.

433
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:07,541
Shorts.

434
00:32:08,041 --> 00:32:10,708
I want to see you in your shorts.

435
00:32:11,208 --> 00:32:14,166
"I find you hot."

436
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:17,958
"Like a million-dollar bill."

437
00:32:18,458 --> 00:32:21,625
"The chance is here and now.."

438
00:32:22,125 --> 00:32:26,125
"..this may never happen again."

439
00:32:26,625 --> 00:32:29,541
Cute.

440
00:32:30,041 --> 00:32:30,416
Hey!

441
00:32:30,916 --> 00:32:31,541
Same pinch.

442
00:32:32,041 --> 00:32:35,541
Forget that. Just wait for the dude's pinch.

443
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:41,458
So..

444
00:32:41,958 --> 00:32:43,000
Let's start all over.

445
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,458
Viraj, I'll just use the loo, we can leave after that.

446
00:32:45,958 --> 00:32:49,458
Cool, I'll wait near the car.

447
00:32:58,125 --> 00:33:00,875
- Sorry. - Hey Viraj..

448
00:33:01,375 --> 00:33:02,625
- Big fan. - Thanks.

449
00:33:03,125 --> 00:33:05,250
Especially, your new lip balm commercial.

450
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:09,250
- Can I get a selfie? - Sure.

451
00:33:13,416 --> 00:33:14,541
- And then? - That's it.

452
00:33:15,041 --> 00:33:17,916
- What happened next? - Sadly, this was it.

453
00:33:18,416 --> 00:33:21,333
- The player was in a hurry. - Why make us get into the pool?

454
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,750
You shattered my speaker.

455
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:25,583
I shattered your ego.

456
00:33:26,083 --> 00:33:28,541
Just a minute.. and why did you call me into the pool?

457
00:33:29,041 --> 00:33:30,000
Because you're very cute.

458
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:33,541
- Hey..hey! - Listen, let me do it.

459
00:33:34,041 --> 00:33:37,541
It's mine.

460
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:45,166
Their father must be a baker, because they've perfect buns.

461
00:33:45,666 --> 00:33:46,458
The cricketer's phone has been tracked.

462
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:49,833
You and Kabir get there, quick! Dera City, 10th street.

463
00:33:50,333 --> 00:33:51,125
Viraj's phone has been tracked.

464
00:33:51,625 --> 00:33:53,041
But Dera City is very far. The traffic will kill us.

465
00:33:53,541 --> 00:33:54,416
Allow me!

466
00:33:54,916 --> 00:33:57,583
Sam never disappoints anyone.

467
00:33:58,083 --> 00:34:00,708
I'll ride you, big boy.

468
00:34:01,208 --> 00:34:04,041
"I'm your hero. Hear me, O wealthy people."

469
00:34:04,541 --> 00:34:05,875
"I'm a man of god."

470
00:34:06,375 --> 00:34:07,625
"A friend to all."

471
00:34:08,125 --> 00:34:09,416
"We've seen the world.."

472
00:34:09,916 --> 00:34:11,291
"..only the two of us are worthy.

473
00:34:11,791 --> 00:34:15,291
"The beauties adore us, spend their wealth on us."

474
00:35:34,041 --> 00:35:37,458
I'm so sorry, ma'am. Are you ok?

475
00:35:37,958 --> 00:35:39,791
Ma'am?

476
00:35:40,291 --> 00:35:44,125
- Shit. - Well done, Junaid.

477
00:35:44,625 --> 00:35:48,125
Got her!

478
00:35:50,333 --> 00:35:53,833
Is she alive? We've to interrogate her.

479
00:35:56,958 --> 00:36:00,333
The corpse is still alive.

480
00:36:00,833 --> 00:36:01,458
How did you find her?

481
00:36:01,958 --> 00:36:04,541
Sir, sometimes you forget that I'm a cop too.

482
00:36:05,041 --> 00:36:07,166
She came running and I gave her one.. bam!

483
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:09,875
In the face. Knocked her out.

484
00:36:10,375 --> 00:36:11,708
- Good job, buddy. - Thanks, Usman.

485
00:36:12,208 --> 00:36:15,333
- Nicely done. - Thanks.

486
00:36:15,833 --> 00:36:18,250
Get to the headquarters with her.

487
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:21,791
I'll check her apartment.

488
00:36:22,291 --> 00:36:23,458
- Junaid.. - Tell me, K.

489
00:36:23,958 --> 00:36:25,041
So what happened there?

490
00:36:25,541 --> 00:36:27,375
Nothing. She was running fast.

491
00:36:27,875 --> 00:36:29,625
She was fleeing from someone. She looked scared.

492
00:36:30,125 --> 00:36:32,166
Means, she was a suspect. So, I understood..

493
00:36:32,666 --> 00:36:34,541
..and punched her on the face.

494
00:36:35,041 --> 00:36:36,208
Tell me the truth now.

495
00:36:36,708 --> 00:36:40,291
She tripped over my car door.

496
00:36:40,791 --> 00:36:43,083
Means, you were useful by accident.

497
00:36:43,583 --> 00:36:46,208
Listen K, please don't tell anyone.

498
00:36:46,708 --> 00:36:48,125
I've managed to impress them for the first time.

499
00:36:48,625 --> 00:36:52,125
If they come to know, I'll become laughing stock.

500
00:37:05,291 --> 00:37:08,625
Your rookie is graduating.

501
00:37:09,125 --> 00:37:12,625
Not bad, Junaid.

502
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:17,166
K..

503
00:37:17,666 --> 00:37:21,166
Thank you.

504
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:26,791
Is there anything that you don't steal?

505
00:37:27,291 --> 00:37:29,166
Hearts.

506
00:37:29,666 --> 00:37:32,291
They're very heavy.

507
00:37:32,791 --> 00:37:34,416
Since when have you been into this?

508
00:37:34,916 --> 00:37:37,958
Not sure. It's a choice..

509
00:37:38,458 --> 00:37:41,583
..not a need.

510
00:37:42,083 --> 00:37:44,125
Pakeezah and Parvati.

511
00:37:44,625 --> 00:37:47,375
Do you work for both ISI and RAW?

512
00:37:47,875 --> 00:37:51,458
Only for myself.

513
00:37:51,958 --> 00:37:55,333
What's your real name?

514
00:37:55,833 --> 00:37:57,958
- Ishika. - Ishika.

515
00:37:58,458 --> 00:38:01,750
Seems you like phones a lot.

516
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:05,750
Which was the last phone that you flicked?

517
00:38:27,125 --> 00:38:28,333
I want a lawyer.

518
00:38:28,833 --> 00:38:31,250
Sit or you won't get up for the rest of your life.

519
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:33,458
You're not allowed to touch me.

520
00:38:33,958 --> 00:38:35,625
Everybody is equal in police custody.

521
00:38:36,125 --> 00:38:37,666
You can take your women's rights parade elsewhere.

522
00:38:38,166 --> 00:38:41,458
- Why have you brought me here? - You were running, you tell us.

523
00:38:41,958 --> 00:38:43,208
Guys, I'm a little lost here.

524
00:38:43,708 --> 00:38:46,083
Illegal immigrants are often 'lost'.

525
00:38:46,583 --> 00:38:49,125
Do you know whom does this belong to?

526
00:38:49,625 --> 00:38:52,791
This?

527
00:38:53,291 --> 00:38:54,750
So I'm here because of this phone?

528
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:56,375
Where did you steal this phone from?

529
00:38:56,875 --> 00:38:58,291
Last night, from a supermarket.

530
00:38:58,791 --> 00:39:01,791
From whom?

531
00:39:02,291 --> 00:39:03,458
He was in the queue with me.

532
00:39:03,958 --> 00:39:05,708
I haven't even unlocked this phone yet.

533
00:39:06,208 --> 00:39:08,625
- How does he look? -Roughly, your height.

534
00:39:09,125 --> 00:39:12,750
Skin tone was wheatish.

535
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:15,708
He was quite like you.

536
00:39:16,208 --> 00:39:20,083
But wasn't as rude as you.

537
00:39:20,583 --> 00:39:24,291
This is my polite self.

538
00:39:24,791 --> 00:39:26,291
Was this the man?

539
00:39:26,791 --> 00:39:27,541
No.

540
00:39:28,041 --> 00:39:30,833
Look carefully.

541
00:39:31,333 --> 00:39:32,750
No, it wasn't him.

542
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:37,125
How can you be so sure?

543
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:41,125
I never forget the faces of those I steal from.

544
00:39:48,625 --> 00:39:49,375
Sir, we're cops.

545
00:39:49,875 --> 00:39:52,250
- But this girl's a thief. - Really?

546
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:55,125
They're lying, uncle. Really..

547
00:39:55,625 --> 00:39:57,125
We want to check your CCTV footage.

548
00:39:57,625 --> 00:40:00,125
That's not been working for a long time.

549
00:40:00,625 --> 00:40:04,125
But yes, there's a camera behind my cash counter.

550
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:15,166
Bloody criminal. Saw that, uncle?

551
00:40:15,666 --> 00:40:19,166
That's how you're losing money.

552
00:40:25,833 --> 00:40:27,166
Who is this man?

553
00:40:27,666 --> 00:40:29,833
I don't know, sir. He was smoking inside.

554
00:40:30,333 --> 00:40:32,000
I told him to go out.

555
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:36,000
But I couldn't see his face properly.

556
00:40:43,958 --> 00:40:44,916
Unbelievable!

557
00:40:45,416 --> 00:40:47,541
Since his entry, you covered his face all the time.

558
00:40:48,041 --> 00:40:50,291
- It wasn't deliberate. - Shut up and get in.

559
00:40:50,791 --> 00:40:54,291
Got him!

560
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:13,250
I can't believe this.

561
00:41:16,333 --> 00:41:19,833
- Where is he? - There's Bradman.

562
00:41:25,041 --> 00:41:26,750
Kabir, I looked for him all over.

563
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:29,583
I prayed in every temple and mosque for him.

564
00:41:30,083 --> 00:41:32,458
I've roamed such infamous lanes with his photo that..

565
00:41:32,958 --> 00:41:34,416
..it tarnished my reputation.

566
00:41:34,916 --> 00:41:36,083
And this shameless bulldog..

567
00:41:36,583 --> 00:41:39,166
..left a palatial house to play in this gutter!

568
00:41:39,666 --> 00:41:40,958
We're looking for an international cricketer.

569
00:41:41,458 --> 00:41:45,583
But your lowly status keeps disrupting work!

570
00:41:46,083 --> 00:41:47,750
You won't understand my joy, K.

571
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:50,291
Today, I feel like Newton, when he found gravity..

572
00:41:50,791 --> 00:41:51,791
Mowgli, when he found clothes..

573
00:41:52,291 --> 00:41:55,125
..and PK, when he found the remote to his spaceship.

574
00:41:55,625 --> 00:41:58,625
I love you, Bradman.

575
00:41:59,125 --> 00:42:01,000
I've solved my first case, Kabir.

576
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:05,000
I've solved it.

577
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:09,916
- Hello. - Junaid Ansari?

578
00:42:10,416 --> 00:42:12,708
- Yes, speaking. - I'm Qureshi speaking.

579
00:42:13,208 --> 00:42:15,833
Your ad in the matrimonials..

580
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:18,791
- Did you see my photos? - Is it you in the suit?

581
00:42:19,291 --> 00:42:20,708
Yes, uncle. It's me in the suit.

582
00:42:21,208 --> 00:42:24,250
I saw your profile, I didn't like you at all.

583
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:26,708
- Excuse me? - I didn't like you at all.

584
00:42:27,208 --> 00:42:30,208
It's ok, sir. Anyway, thank you for viewing my profile.

585
00:42:30,708 --> 00:42:33,083
Bradman, good looking boys get no respect these days.

586
00:42:33,583 --> 00:42:36,250
Stupid people.

587
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:41,208
We've reached your house, Bradman.

588
00:42:41,708 --> 00:42:44,125
- Hello? - I showed your photo to my wife.

589
00:42:44,625 --> 00:42:45,875
Moms often tend to like me.

590
00:42:46,375 --> 00:42:48,250
She didn't like you either.

591
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:52,208
She said, you spoilt my mood early in the morning.

592
00:42:52,708 --> 00:42:55,125
Forget it, uncle. What can I do if she didn't like me!

593
00:42:55,625 --> 00:43:01,166
No, dear. It's important to inform. Don't mind, son.

594
00:43:01,666 --> 00:43:04,541
Brad.. Bradman!

595
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:07,708
I forgot, often we start liking a photo over time.

596
00:43:08,208 --> 00:43:10,333
We stared at your photo for an hour.

597
00:43:10,833 --> 00:43:11,083
And?

598
00:43:11,583 --> 00:43:15,291
We didn't like it. None of us liked it.

599
00:43:15,791 --> 00:43:17,333
Enough of your nonsense!

600
00:43:17,833 --> 00:43:20,458
Don't take undue advantage of my politeness!

601
00:43:20,958 --> 00:43:23,125
I'm a cop, I'll give you the thrashing of a lifetime.

602
00:43:23,625 --> 00:43:27,250
Hang up now!

603
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:28,666
You can go wherever you want..

604
00:43:29,166 --> 00:43:32,125
..but you can't escape my radar.

605
00:43:32,625 --> 00:43:35,291
And I'll replace the batteries every three months.

606
00:43:35,791 --> 00:43:39,291
Here you go, Mr. Bradman. I've fitted a GPS on you.

607
00:43:42,666 --> 00:43:45,583
His hair was short.

608
00:43:46,083 --> 00:43:49,583
Just like Kabir.

609
00:43:53,291 --> 00:43:56,250
He looked angry.

610
00:43:56,750 --> 00:44:00,250
Just like Kabir.

611
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:04,458
Body..

612
00:44:04,958 --> 00:44:09,083
Mention my name again and I'll deport you to India via cargo.

613
00:44:09,583 --> 00:44:11,875
Before you deport me..

614
00:44:12,375 --> 00:44:14,791
..make sure to return my heart.

615
00:44:15,291 --> 00:44:17,833
What about the sketch?

616
00:44:18,333 --> 00:44:20,875
Sorry, I got distracted.

617
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:26,416
- Where was I? - What about the eyes?

618
00:44:26,916 --> 00:44:31,125
His eyes had pain or mischief..

619
00:44:31,625 --> 00:44:33,250
Just can't tell.

620
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:37,833
But they were a deep black.

621
00:44:38,333 --> 00:44:39,791
Don't stare like that.

622
00:44:40,291 --> 00:44:41,541
I feel shy.

623
00:44:42,041 --> 00:44:43,333
Don't laugh, I feel disgusted.

624
00:44:43,833 --> 00:44:45,875
I'm sleepy, can we finish the sketch?

625
00:44:46,375 --> 00:44:48,083
I'm hungry.

626
00:44:48,583 --> 00:44:50,583
I can't think on an empty stomach.

627
00:44:51,083 --> 00:44:52,666
Can I get something, please?

628
00:44:53,166 --> 00:44:54,708
How about a slap? They're quite nice here.

629
00:44:55,208 --> 00:44:58,125
Your hatred..

630
00:44:58,625 --> 00:45:00,666
..is very sexy.

631
00:45:01,166 --> 00:45:04,666
This sketch can never be completed.

632
00:45:08,333 --> 00:45:12,250
The girl's very cunning. She's conning everybody.

633
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:13,791
Nobody looks like this.

634
00:45:14,291 --> 00:45:17,458
If the final's cancelled, I'll kill him.

635
00:45:17,958 --> 00:45:21,250
It's just a matter of 36 hours.

636
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:23,666
- Let him stay here. - Why are we watching it again?

637
00:45:24,166 --> 00:45:27,666
Now we'll hear the cleaned audio track, without the voice.

638
00:45:33,291 --> 00:45:35,250
- What do you hear? - A drizzle?

639
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:37,833
It doesn't rain here, must be a leakage.

640
00:45:38,333 --> 00:45:41,833
Check if it rained in the nearby regions in the last 24 hours.

641
00:45:45,541 --> 00:45:47,916
If the villagers from 'Lagaan' movie had this weather app..

642
00:45:48,416 --> 00:45:50,833
..then they wouldn't have sung to the clouds everyday.

643
00:45:51,333 --> 00:45:52,958
If they could afford an Ipad..

644
00:45:53,458 --> 00:45:54,458
..they'd have paid the tax.

645
00:45:54,958 --> 00:45:56,333
And not played cricket to meet their needs.

646
00:45:56,833 --> 00:46:00,333
That reminds me, you're getting distracted. Please focus.

647
00:46:10,833 --> 00:46:16,708
C'mon, make it rain. Make it rain.

648
00:46:17,208 --> 00:46:18,333
It rained in Al Jabal.

649
00:46:18,833 --> 00:46:19,708
We can't ignore it.

650
00:46:20,208 --> 00:46:21,208
This is our best lead, sir.

651
00:46:21,708 --> 00:46:23,958
Get a list of schools and buildings in the rain-hit areas.

652
00:46:24,458 --> 00:46:27,958
Sir!

653
00:46:31,666 --> 00:46:33,458
Hussain, you head to the Islamic education school.

654
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:34,375
Yes, sir.

655
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:36,708
I'll go to the Medical District and you both..

656
00:46:37,208 --> 00:46:39,250
..head towards Al Jabal park with Saeed.

657
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:43,250
Sir!

658
00:47:07,416 --> 00:47:08,958
Saeed, did you find them?

659
00:47:09,458 --> 00:47:11,000
Viraj isn't here.

660
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:15,000
But his kidnapper is still in this park.

661
00:48:54,166 --> 00:48:56,000
Rashid.

662
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,291
This camera was found in the garbage outside Al Jabal park.

663
00:48:58,791 --> 00:49:01,958
Check it.

664
00:49:02,458 --> 00:49:05,958
- Where's Viraj? - I don't know.

665
00:49:11,666 --> 00:49:15,166
What did you do to Viraj?

666
00:49:23,125 --> 00:49:24,791
Kabir, you have to see this.

667
00:49:25,291 --> 00:49:27,291
This video is for Gulf and India.. no..

668
00:49:27,791 --> 00:49:29,458
This video..

669
00:49:29,958 --> 00:49:32,291
India..

670
00:49:32,791 --> 00:49:36,458
This video is for the governments of India and the Gulf States..

671
00:49:36,958 --> 00:49:39,375
..for the administration.. This video is for..

672
00:49:39,875 --> 00:49:41,166
..administration in India and the Gulf.

673
00:49:41,666 --> 00:49:44,541
Since you don't know me, consider me a Shahid Afridi fan.

674
00:49:45,041 --> 00:49:46,916
Shahid Afridi.. Imran Khan..

675
00:49:47,416 --> 00:49:49,750
Imran Khan.. Javed Miandad.. Inza.. no.

676
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:52,708
Pakistan.. yes, just consider me a fan.

677
00:49:53,208 --> 00:49:55,291
This is for the governments of India and the Gulf states.

678
00:49:55,791 --> 00:49:59,291
Since you don't know me, just consider me a fan.

679
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:05,666
Damn, I forgot my lines!

680
00:50:06,166 --> 00:50:09,666
Sorry, sir. Last take.

681
00:50:12,708 --> 00:50:15,250
The way you fumble with your lines in an audition..

682
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:18,250
- How will you become an actor? -No, sir, actually..

683
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:20,416
..I've performed lead roles on stage.

684
00:50:20,916 --> 00:50:24,041
I just get a little jittery in front of the camera. Sorry.

685
00:50:24,541 --> 00:50:28,458
If you want this role, you'll have to give it your best.

686
00:50:28,958 --> 00:50:30,791
People should feel afraid of your character.

687
00:50:31,291 --> 00:50:34,250
That's the problem, sir. I've only done positive characters till date.

688
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:36,208
That's why, sir..

689
00:50:36,708 --> 00:50:37,958
..I'm finding it a bit difficult to get into the groove.

690
00:50:38,458 --> 00:50:41,125
We don't have much time.

691
00:50:41,625 --> 00:50:43,458
Understood, sir. Watch now.

692
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:47,250
Ready, sir.

693
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:50,958
Pakistan.. Pakistan..

694
00:50:51,458 --> 00:50:53,333
Pakistan.. Pakistan..

695
00:50:53,833 --> 00:50:55,583
He's a struggling actor.

696
00:50:56,083 --> 00:50:58,958
Thought it was an audition.

697
00:50:59,458 --> 00:51:02,791
The video was made to mislead us.

698
00:51:03,291 --> 00:51:05,541
So that, by the time we nab him..

699
00:51:06,041 --> 00:51:06,916
..they're already far away.

700
00:51:07,416 --> 00:51:09,708
It's ok.

701
00:51:10,208 --> 00:51:13,291
Sir, I..

702
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:17,291
Thank you.

703
00:51:20,791 --> 00:51:23,166
12 hours ago, we atleast had a face.

704
00:51:23,666 --> 00:51:27,166
Now we've to chase this mask.

705
00:51:50,041 --> 00:51:53,541
It's him!

706
00:51:55,041 --> 00:51:57,791
He auditioned me, then beat me up..

707
00:51:58,291 --> 00:52:01,791
..and locked me up in that room.

708
00:52:05,166 --> 00:52:06,458
The girl's very cunning.

709
00:52:06,958 --> 00:52:10,458
She's conning everybody. Nobody looks like this.

710
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:42,208
Can you please smoke outside?

711
00:52:42,708 --> 00:52:44,625
Bloody b**ch!

712
00:52:45,125 --> 00:52:46,541
Bloody b**ch..?

713
00:52:47,041 --> 00:52:47,583
Hey, watch your language!

714
00:52:48,083 --> 00:52:51,458
That man abused you in Pashto, not me.

715
00:52:51,958 --> 00:52:53,083
Bloody b**ch.

716
00:52:53,583 --> 00:52:55,166
Which are the Pashtun dominated areas here?

717
00:52:55,666 --> 00:52:56,208
Very few.

718
00:52:56,708 --> 00:52:59,000
Pashtuns usually come from across the border to work here.

719
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:00,708
But I don't understand..

720
00:53:01,208 --> 00:53:05,000
..why a Pashtun man would pose as a Pakistani to kidnap an Indian?

721
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:07,250
I don't know why, but when..

722
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:11,250
..is gradually becoming clearer.

723
00:53:23,666 --> 00:53:26,250
Wanna come for her birthday party?

724
00:53:26,750 --> 00:53:28,291
We've to kill it in the finals this time.

725
00:53:28,791 --> 00:53:30,291
Just be careful with your hook shot.

726
00:53:30,791 --> 00:53:31,458
Sure.

727
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:33,916
I'm good.

728
00:53:34,416 --> 00:53:36,416
Viraj, I'll just use the loo, then we can leave.

729
00:53:36,916 --> 00:53:40,583
Cool, I'll wait near the car.

730
00:53:41,083 --> 00:53:43,416
Hey Viraj! Big fan.

731
00:53:43,916 --> 00:53:47,416
- Can I get a selfie? - Sure.

732
00:54:05,958 --> 00:54:08,125
Answer it, Sharma.

733
00:54:08,625 --> 00:54:11,250
How long will you ignore it?

734
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:15,250
Answer it.

735
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:17,875
Viraj, a car will stop by in ten seconds.

736
00:54:18,375 --> 00:54:19,583
Get in quietly.

737
00:54:20,083 --> 00:54:21,625
We need to talk.

738
00:54:22,125 --> 00:54:25,625
Who are you?

739
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:50,750
Phone.

740
00:55:01,333 --> 00:55:04,833
For you..

741
00:55:15,916 --> 00:55:18,750
This is going to be another one of those Viraj Sharma specials.

742
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:23,208
Oh yes! What a shot, what a player!

743
00:55:23,708 --> 00:55:25,916
Whenever I see you play..

744
00:55:26,416 --> 00:55:28,375
..my heart wells up.

745
00:55:28,875 --> 00:55:32,708
But my pockets get emptied.

746
00:55:33,208 --> 00:55:37,000
Neither did you answer my phone, nor reply to my messages.

747
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:38,458
I mean..

748
00:55:38,958 --> 00:55:41,541
Like every modern love story, we too..

749
00:55:42,041 --> 00:55:44,625
..have a one-sided affair.

750
00:55:45,125 --> 00:55:45,916
Who are you?

751
00:55:46,416 --> 00:55:49,291
Afridi is lovingly called Lala.

752
00:55:49,791 --> 00:55:51,666
Dravid is Jammy and Ganguly is Dada..

753
00:55:52,166 --> 00:55:54,166
Pet names are the norm in my business too.

754
00:55:54,666 --> 00:55:55,583
The name's Wagah.

755
00:55:56,083 --> 00:55:58,541
Just like the border, I'm neither India's, nor Pakistan's.

756
00:55:59,041 --> 00:56:02,125
The player who turns the tables..

757
00:56:02,625 --> 00:56:05,208
..makes it to my hit list.

758
00:56:05,708 --> 00:56:08,750
- What do you want from me? - Your form, Viraj.

759
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:11,458
Your form.

760
00:56:11,958 --> 00:56:14,291
In the first match, you scored 86 against Pakistan.

761
00:56:14,791 --> 00:56:17,541
Then 124 against Bangladesh.

762
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:21,125
And now, 94 not out in the semi-finals.

763
00:56:21,625 --> 00:56:23,875
Viraj, whenever you punish the bowlers..

764
00:56:24,375 --> 00:56:26,375
..I bear the brunt of it.

765
00:56:26,875 --> 00:56:28,916
And whenever you win a losing game..

766
00:56:29,416 --> 00:56:32,833
..I'm the one who is betrayed.

767
00:56:33,333 --> 00:56:36,833
I'm down by 450 crores because of you.

768
00:56:48,291 --> 00:56:49,250
You want something?

769
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:52,458
Protein shake, energy bar.. It's all there for you.

770
00:56:52,958 --> 00:56:55,208
Because you have to slog hard for the finals.

771
00:56:55,708 --> 00:56:58,291
You just have to play 25 overs. But while you're at the crease..

772
00:56:58,791 --> 00:57:00,083
..the run rate has to be below five..

773
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:04,166
..and get two of the top batsmen in your team dismissed by run outs.

774
00:57:04,666 --> 00:57:08,833
Viraj, your image is so clean that nobody would even doubt it.

775
00:57:09,333 --> 00:57:11,458
Though the people worship you..

776
00:57:11,958 --> 00:57:16,125
..you just need to act human for this one game.

777
00:57:16,625 --> 00:57:18,708
Let's get down to business.

778
00:57:19,208 --> 00:57:21,375
What was your fee in the last season?

779
00:57:21,875 --> 00:57:22,916
15 crores.

780
00:57:23,416 --> 00:57:26,541
15 crores, right? I'll double it in one game.

781
00:57:27,041 --> 00:57:29,458
One crore per over. 25 crores for playing 25 overs.

782
00:57:29,958 --> 00:57:32,791
And five crores for getting out in the 26th over.

783
00:57:33,291 --> 00:57:36,791
That's thirty.

784
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:43,000
I'll charge atleast fifty for not scoring a century.

785
00:57:54,791 --> 00:57:58,125
Whenever I tried to fall in love with you..

786
00:57:58,625 --> 00:58:00,166
..you hiked up your rates.

787
00:58:00,666 --> 00:58:04,083
25 before the match and 25 after the match.

788
00:58:04,583 --> 00:58:06,833
I just shook your hand..

789
00:58:07,333 --> 00:58:08,375
..but you turned it into a hug.

790
00:58:08,875 --> 00:58:09,833
Done.

791
00:58:10,333 --> 00:58:12,375
What's the guarantee that you'll pay?

792
00:58:12,875 --> 00:58:15,833
Buddy, the only thing that's respected in my business..

793
00:58:16,333 --> 00:58:17,625
..is one's word.

794
00:58:18,125 --> 00:58:20,625
Once given, I'll not turn back.

795
00:58:21,125 --> 00:58:22,208
Sounds good.

796
00:58:22,708 --> 00:58:25,166
Atleast, open my eyes now.

797
00:58:25,666 --> 00:58:29,000
I want to see you.

798
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:32,666
You're getting too romantic, buddy.

799
00:58:33,166 --> 00:58:36,833
We shouldn't get so intimate on the first date.

800
00:58:37,333 --> 00:58:40,250
I've laid hands on a big player after ages.

801
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:44,333
And I'm sure we'll be working together a lot in future.

802
00:58:44,833 --> 00:58:46,750
In time..

803
00:58:47,250 --> 00:58:50,750
..you'll see my face too.

804
00:59:15,375 --> 00:59:17,875
Take the lift. You'll get a cab outside.

805
00:59:18,375 --> 00:59:19,958
The deal's locked.

806
00:59:20,458 --> 00:59:21,750
Atleast drop me at the hotel.

807
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:25,750
I only do as much as I'm told.

808
00:59:31,166 --> 00:59:34,666
Here's the token amount.

809
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:15,250
Excuse me.

810
01:00:30,416 --> 01:00:33,416
Police?

811
01:00:33,916 --> 01:00:34,625
Any doubts?

812
01:00:35,125 --> 01:00:35,875
Indian?

813
01:00:36,375 --> 01:00:37,708
I'm a local.

814
01:00:38,208 --> 01:00:41,750
I'm an Indian cricketer, Viraj Sharma.

815
01:00:42,250 --> 01:00:44,250
No, a batsman.

816
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:47,250
I'm.. I'm a bit lost.

817
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:50,541
Can you help me get back to my hotel?

818
01:00:51,041 --> 01:00:53,000
- The Viceroy hotel. - Sure.

819
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:56,708
I'm headed that way.

820
01:00:57,208 --> 01:01:00,916
- How long will it take? - Not much.

821
01:01:01,416 --> 01:01:04,166
You look very frightened.

822
01:01:04,666 --> 01:01:06,333
Is my voice troubling you?

823
01:01:06,833 --> 01:01:08,000
Officer..

824
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:12,833
A bookie kidnapped me at gun point and tried to fix a match.

825
01:01:13,333 --> 01:01:14,250
Did you see their faces?

826
01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:17,000
In fact, his man gave me this bag in the parking lot.

827
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:18,625
Officer, please listen to me.

828
01:01:19,125 --> 01:01:22,625
Take me to the nearest police station, please.

829
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:28,875
I'll take you directly to my captain's house.

830
01:01:29,375 --> 01:01:31,250
Thank you so much, sir.

831
01:01:31,750 --> 01:01:32,875
No problem.

832
01:01:33,375 --> 01:01:36,875
It's my duty.

833
01:01:45,541 --> 01:01:47,750
Need to see the captain.

834
01:01:48,250 --> 01:01:51,750
Come in.

835
01:01:56,208 --> 01:01:59,708
Five minutes.

836
01:02:01,291 --> 01:02:03,458
Did you hear anyone's name being called there?

837
01:02:03,958 --> 01:02:05,625
Wagah.

838
01:02:06,125 --> 01:02:08,291
That man's name is Wagah.

839
01:02:08,791 --> 01:02:10,416
But I couldn't see his face.

840
01:02:10,916 --> 01:02:13,000
Remember anything else?

841
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:15,416
Only his voice.

842
01:02:15,916 --> 01:02:18,708
I didn't understand one thing..

843
01:02:19,208 --> 01:02:24,250
..why did he let you go?

844
01:02:24,750 --> 01:02:28,250
Did you fix a deal with him?

845
01:02:34,166 --> 01:02:37,166
You look very frightened.

846
01:02:37,666 --> 01:02:41,166
Is my voice troubling you?

847
01:02:50,291 --> 01:02:51,583
Remember, I told you..

848
01:02:52,083 --> 01:02:55,583
In time, you'll see my face too.

849
01:03:17,750 --> 01:03:20,041
Everybody has a weakness.

850
01:03:20,541 --> 01:03:24,833
We'll find out about his.

851
01:03:25,333 --> 01:03:27,666
For now, we'll have to shift him out of here.

852
01:03:28,166 --> 01:03:31,208
The rascal has seen both me and the place.

853
01:03:31,708 --> 01:03:33,458
I know a place that..

854
01:03:33,958 --> 01:03:38,541
..the cops will never dare to think of.

855
01:03:39,041 --> 01:03:41,375
We've received a list of cars from the border security..

856
01:03:41,875 --> 01:03:46,583
..which have crossed over in the last 24 hours.

857
01:03:47,083 --> 01:03:49,375
That's your guy! He's the one.

858
01:03:49,875 --> 01:03:51,291
His name is Altaf.

859
01:03:51,791 --> 01:03:55,583
He had come here three days back, but returned to Abbudin.

860
01:03:56,083 --> 01:03:57,541
So let's move. How many hours to reach?

861
01:03:58,041 --> 01:04:00,375
- Around.. - It's not about the distance.

862
01:04:00,875 --> 01:04:03,458
- Abbudin is like Pakistan for us. - What's your point?

863
01:04:03,958 --> 01:04:07,250
If a criminal from your country, manages to cross the border..

864
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:08,541
..do you ever get him back?

865
01:04:09,041 --> 01:04:11,750
If the kidnapping victim isn't found in the first 48 hours..

866
01:04:12,250 --> 01:04:13,041
..he'll never be found again.

867
01:04:13,541 --> 01:04:15,708
It'll take longer to get a visa to that place.

868
01:04:16,208 --> 01:04:17,708
Abbudin is out of our jurisdiction.

869
01:04:18,208 --> 01:04:22,416
Yours, not mine.

870
01:04:22,916 --> 01:04:25,291
If you cross that border, you're not our responsibility.

871
01:04:25,791 --> 01:04:29,291
I'm no one's responsibility, anyway.

872
01:04:33,250 --> 01:04:36,250
Junaid Ansari, what do you think you're doing!

873
01:04:36,750 --> 01:04:38,208
Sir, you know..

874
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:41,958
..that a day earlier, I couldn't even find a missing dog.

875
01:04:42,458 --> 01:04:45,000
But everything changed after Kabir arrived.

876
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:47,083
I drove the car for the first time..

877
01:04:47,583 --> 01:04:49,000
..not to buy vegetables..

878
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:51,166
..but to find information.

879
01:04:51,666 --> 01:04:53,000
I ran on the streets.

880
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:55,583
Not to mind your kids..

881
01:04:56,083 --> 01:04:58,208
..but to stop suspects.

882
01:04:58,708 --> 01:05:00,208
Most importantly..

883
01:05:00,708 --> 01:05:04,208
..through your department, I worked for my country.

884
01:05:04,708 --> 01:05:07,625
I know that none of you think highly of me.

885
01:05:08,125 --> 01:05:10,708
But Kabir trusts me fully.

886
01:05:11,208 --> 01:05:12,125
I wouldn't want to break that.

887
01:05:12,625 --> 01:05:16,125
Please leave your keys, badge and gun on the table.

888
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:27,000
I can take you guys to Abbudin.

889
01:05:40,541 --> 01:05:42,666
- What are you doing here? - I quit.

890
01:05:43,166 --> 01:05:46,666
Don't worry, Kabir. We don't need anybody.

891
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:54,000
You deserve it, take.

892
01:05:59,625 --> 01:06:00,916
But there's a small complication.

893
01:06:01,416 --> 01:06:02,958
They took away the car keys and the gun.

894
01:06:03,458 --> 01:06:06,958
Give back the cigarette.

895
01:06:09,833 --> 01:06:12,416
Earlier, you were useless for them and now you're useless to me.

896
01:06:12,916 --> 01:06:15,791
I just praised you so much in there and you're insulting me!

897
01:06:16,291 --> 01:06:17,458
That's what you deserve. Go back in.

898
01:06:17,958 --> 01:06:19,875
Hey Kabir, you maybe Munnabhai..

899
01:06:20,375 --> 01:06:21,333
..but I'm not Circuit.

900
01:06:21,833 --> 01:06:25,666
You maybe Batman, but I'm not Birdman. You maybe a hero..

901
01:06:26,166 --> 01:06:28,083
..but even I'm a hero now.

902
01:06:28,583 --> 01:06:31,000
We've to find Viraj and bring him back.

903
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:35,000
- My new-found reputation is at stake. - And I've an old one to protect!

904
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:47,333
Do you want some hot chocolate, Meera?

905
01:06:55,791 --> 01:06:58,458
Meera Behl, daughter of Balraj Behl.

906
01:06:58,958 --> 01:07:01,666
After your mom passed away, your dad married a second time..

907
01:07:02,166 --> 01:07:04,166
..much to your distress.

908
01:07:04,666 --> 01:07:06,583
You indulged in substance abuse.

909
01:07:07,083 --> 01:07:08,875
Daddy had to put you in rehab.

910
01:07:09,375 --> 01:07:10,666
But you escaped from there.

911
01:07:11,166 --> 01:07:13,333
First Thailand, then Istanbul..

912
01:07:13,833 --> 01:07:17,333
..and finally here.

913
01:07:19,250 --> 01:07:20,791
What I don't understand is..

914
01:07:21,291 --> 01:07:21,958
..why here?

915
01:07:22,458 --> 01:07:25,750
Don't you know we have strict laws for drug addicts?

916
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:28,416
Since I got addicted to being on the run..

917
01:07:28,916 --> 01:07:31,041
..I gave up all others.

918
01:07:31,541 --> 01:07:35,416
I'm clean, officer.

919
01:07:35,916 --> 01:07:37,333
No point telling me all this.

920
01:07:37,833 --> 01:07:39,916
People from the Indian embassy are on their way here.

921
01:07:40,416 --> 01:07:43,000
Time to go home, Meera.

922
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:47,000
Can I use the restroom?

923
01:07:57,416 --> 01:08:00,916
Don't shout.

924
01:08:02,083 --> 01:08:03,083
What are you doing here?

925
01:08:03,583 --> 01:08:07,000
I've been practising Spiderman's kiss for years, wanna try?

926
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:09,333
No way!

927
01:08:09,833 --> 01:08:12,541
What's taking so long?

928
01:08:13,041 --> 01:08:15,708
Two minutes!

929
01:08:16,208 --> 01:08:18,916
- Will you take us to Abbudin? - But how do we get out of here?

930
01:08:19,416 --> 01:08:22,416
- Give me your hand. - What?

931
01:08:22,916 --> 01:08:23,375
Don't worry.

932
01:08:23,875 --> 01:08:25,041
'Tyson' is pulling us up.

933
01:08:25,541 --> 01:08:28,250
Ahoy, buddy!

934
01:08:28,750 --> 01:08:29,708
He's so strong.

935
01:08:30,208 --> 01:08:32,041
And what about my Spiderman stunt?

936
01:08:32,541 --> 01:08:36,041
Let's get to Abbudin.

937
01:09:00,208 --> 01:09:02,041
He's better off sleeping.

938
01:09:02,541 --> 01:09:04,958
Such men live alone all their lives.

939
01:09:05,458 --> 01:09:08,750
Tell me, why does this grumpy guy carry the world's burden on his back?

940
01:09:09,250 --> 01:09:10,958
He has a very sad story.

941
01:09:11,458 --> 01:09:13,291
But it's not his fault.

942
01:09:13,791 --> 01:09:15,625
There's a fault in his stars.

943
01:09:16,125 --> 01:09:17,250
Well, forget it, Senorita.

944
01:09:17,750 --> 01:09:19,666
Let's talk something good.

945
01:09:20,166 --> 01:09:21,833
Your legs look quite strong.

946
01:09:22,333 --> 01:09:24,625
Other than running from the cops, what else do you do for cardio?

947
01:09:25,125 --> 01:09:27,458
- Not much really. - Good enough.

948
01:09:27,958 --> 01:09:32,625
What happened with him? Now I really wanna know.

949
01:09:33,125 --> 01:09:36,583
Kabir used to be a happy man once. He had the perfect life.

950
01:09:37,083 --> 01:09:41,250
But then..

951
01:09:41,750 --> 01:09:44,083
..he fell gravely ill.

952
01:09:44,583 --> 01:09:48,083
What?

953
01:09:50,791 --> 01:09:51,916
Testicular cancer.

954
01:09:52,416 --> 01:09:54,625
Because of that his girlfriend cheated on him.

955
01:09:55,125 --> 01:09:56,041
What?!

956
01:09:56,541 --> 01:09:58,375
The disease was cured..

957
01:09:58,875 --> 01:10:01,166
..but his anger..

958
01:10:01,666 --> 01:10:02,541
..rages on.

959
01:10:03,041 --> 01:10:04,916
Since then, this man turned into a beast!

960
01:10:05,416 --> 01:10:08,916
Like a mad elephant, he's destroying everything on his path.

961
01:11:41,041 --> 01:11:44,541
Passport!

962
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:10,708
Abbudin!

963
01:13:11,208 --> 01:13:14,708
Abbudin!

964
01:13:16,958 --> 01:13:20,375
Abbudin! Abbudin!

965
01:13:20,875 --> 01:13:22,750
Abbudin! Abbudin!

966
01:13:23,250 --> 01:13:25,666
Abbudin! Abbudin!

967
01:13:26,166 --> 01:13:30,583
Abbudin! Abbudin!

968
01:13:31,083 --> 01:13:32,083
Thank you.

969
01:13:32,583 --> 01:13:34,083
Welcome, friend!

970
01:13:34,583 --> 01:13:37,333
I sell all kinds of weapons, except nuclear weapons.

971
01:13:37,833 --> 01:13:41,958
- What do you want? - Who is this?

972
01:13:42,458 --> 01:13:43,291
This is Abbudin.

973
01:13:43,791 --> 01:13:47,000
Out here, even Google can't search the way I can.

974
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:52,291
But there's a price for every man.

975
01:13:52,791 --> 01:13:56,083
- He's a local. - Where can I find him?

976
01:13:56,583 --> 01:14:00,333
Many secrets are buried in the soil of Abbudin.

977
01:14:00,833 --> 01:14:04,333
Go ahead.

978
01:14:09,916 --> 01:14:11,875
- Hello, friend! - Hello.

979
01:14:12,375 --> 01:14:13,541
This is her mother.

980
01:14:14,041 --> 01:14:16,291
But he's the father of this child.

981
01:14:16,791 --> 01:14:19,000
He's the father of many children in Abbudin.

982
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:23,625
Oh.. so he's a famous man!

983
01:14:24,125 --> 01:14:24,750
Where can I find him?

984
01:14:25,250 --> 01:14:29,250
There's a price for every man here.

985
01:14:29,750 --> 01:14:33,250
Price.

986
01:14:34,833 --> 01:14:39,333
- Go ahead. - Give me a straight answer.

987
01:14:39,833 --> 01:14:42,166
He's underground.

988
01:14:42,666 --> 01:14:46,166
Go ahead.

989
01:14:48,958 --> 01:14:51,625
You arrested me because I stole Altaf's phone.

990
01:14:52,125 --> 01:14:55,083
But Altaf stole this phone from someone else.

991
01:14:55,583 --> 01:14:58,583
That means, we're looking for the phone's original owner.

992
01:14:59,083 --> 01:15:03,708
You're thinking too hard. Don't tax your little brains.

993
01:15:04,208 --> 01:15:07,666
Junaid, I'm Qureshi from India, remember?

994
01:15:08,166 --> 01:15:09,458
How can I forget you?

995
01:15:09,958 --> 01:15:13,791
My elder brother in Dubai, Muskaan's uncle..

996
01:15:14,291 --> 01:15:15,875
I showed him your photo.

997
01:15:16,375 --> 01:15:17,916
I thought of taking his opinion as well.

998
01:15:18,416 --> 01:15:19,291
And what's his opinion?

999
01:15:19,791 --> 01:15:21,791
Even he didn't like you at all.

1000
01:15:22,291 --> 01:15:23,916
Not even a wee bit.

1001
01:15:24,416 --> 01:15:27,916
I'm at work, don't irritate.. Hey, where are you going?!

1002
01:15:38,083 --> 01:15:39,625
- C'mon, give it back. - Careful.

1003
01:15:40,125 --> 01:15:43,625
The boy's not alone.

1004
01:15:50,250 --> 01:15:52,208
They're young.

1005
01:15:52,708 --> 01:15:56,208
Then try cuddling them!

1006
01:15:59,125 --> 01:16:02,625
Dad.

1007
01:16:05,875 --> 01:16:09,375
He's really the father of many kids in Abbudin.

1008
01:16:35,541 --> 01:16:37,291
- Abbudin's soil.. - ..has many buried secrets.

1009
01:16:37,791 --> 01:16:39,208
He's underground.

1010
01:16:39,708 --> 01:16:43,208
So this is what 'underground' means.

1011
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:46,541
Thank you for bringing us here.

1012
01:16:47,041 --> 01:16:48,833
And you're welcome, for getting you out of there.

1013
01:16:49,333 --> 01:16:50,791
- Have a good life. - Wait!

1014
01:16:51,291 --> 01:16:53,875
You can't get rid of me so easily.

1015
01:16:54,375 --> 01:16:57,875
Wait!

1016
01:17:34,333 --> 01:17:35,625
What's going on here?

1017
01:17:36,125 --> 01:17:39,250
This is the most colourful game of Abbudin.

1018
01:17:39,750 --> 01:17:41,750
An enchanting beauty..

1019
01:17:42,250 --> 01:17:48,041
..will dance in front of these beasts.

1020
01:17:48,541 --> 01:17:51,708
Then these people will arm wrestle..

1021
01:17:52,208 --> 01:17:55,458
..and the strongest arm..

1022
01:17:55,958 --> 01:18:02,166
..will take that beauty home.

1023
01:18:02,666 --> 01:18:06,166
It's a feast for the beasts!

1024
01:18:20,666 --> 01:18:23,791
"Morning, we'll think about our deeds tonight."

1025
01:18:24,291 --> 01:18:27,208
"Morning, we can count our mistakes."

1026
01:18:27,708 --> 01:18:34,333
"Let's unite for tonight, who knows if we'll meet again!"

1027
01:18:34,833 --> 01:18:38,208
"Morning, we'll head back home."

1028
01:18:38,708 --> 01:18:41,791
"Morning, let the world say what it wants."

1029
01:18:42,291 --> 01:18:48,625
"Let's unite for tonight, who knows if we'll meet again!"

1030
01:18:49,125 --> 01:18:55,791
"I'll survive hell, for the cure of love!"

1031
01:18:56,291 --> 01:19:03,000
"I'll survive hell, for the cure of love!"

1032
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:10,083
"I can die for you, no harm saying so!"

1033
01:19:10,583 --> 01:19:14,083
"I'll survive hell, for the cure of love!"

1034
01:19:31,916 --> 01:19:38,708
"Take me in your arms."

1035
01:19:39,208 --> 01:19:45,958
"A few moments is all I seek."

1036
01:19:46,458 --> 01:19:52,958
"I feel the same."

1037
01:19:53,458 --> 01:19:59,916
"I feel the same."

1038
01:20:00,416 --> 01:20:07,458
"I can die for you, no harm saying so!"

1039
01:20:07,958 --> 01:20:14,541
"I'll survive hell, for the cure of love!"

1040
01:20:15,041 --> 01:20:21,458
"I'll survive hell, for the cure of love!"

1041
01:20:21,958 --> 01:20:28,708
"I can die for you, no harm saying so!"

1042
01:20:29,208 --> 01:20:32,708
"I'll survive hell, for the cure of love!"

1043
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:08,541
"Let's feign love till morning."

1044
01:21:09,041 --> 01:21:12,000
"Let's make false promises till morning."

1045
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:19,041
"Let's unite for tonight, who knows if we'll meet again!"

1046
01:21:19,541 --> 01:21:23,041
"Let's spoil ourselves till morning."

1047
01:21:23,541 --> 01:21:26,291
"Let's fulfill all desires till morning."

1048
01:21:26,791 --> 01:21:30,291
"Let's unite for tonight, who knows if we'll meet again!"

1049
01:22:04,458 --> 01:22:05,625
Where's Viraj Sharma?

1050
01:22:06,125 --> 01:22:08,916
Altaf! Altaf!

1051
01:22:09,416 --> 01:22:15,041
Altaf! Altaf!

1052
01:22:15,541 --> 01:22:19,041
You guys are late. The cricketer must be dead by now.

1053
01:22:25,375 --> 01:22:28,666
Put your toys on the table..

1054
01:22:29,166 --> 01:22:32,666
..ours are bigger.

1055
01:22:39,291 --> 01:22:43,000
The girl who stole my phone led you both here.

1056
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:47,708
- She knows nothing. - That's why I won't kill her.

1057
01:22:48,208 --> 01:22:50,291
Just keep her.

1058
01:22:50,791 --> 01:22:53,666
Five rounds for him.

1059
01:22:54,166 --> 01:22:57,666
The sound of gunshots should be enough to kill that one.

1060
01:23:30,166 --> 01:23:33,666
Two guys are chasing Altaf.

1061
01:23:41,708 --> 01:23:44,750
Kabir, faster!

1062
01:23:45,250 --> 01:23:48,750
Faster, Kabir!

1063
01:24:42,250 --> 01:24:49,041
"I can die for you, no harm saying so!"

1064
01:24:49,541 --> 01:24:53,041
"I'll survive hell, for the cure of love!"

1065
01:25:16,083 --> 01:25:19,583
Watch out, mines!

1066
01:25:21,083 --> 01:25:23,458
Junaid, the flags shouldn't fall.

1067
01:25:23,958 --> 01:25:27,458
Junaid, protect your goods!

1068
01:26:30,833 --> 01:26:34,333
Not now, prayers are going on.

1069
01:26:36,375 --> 01:26:40,458
We've to enter or he'll escape.

1070
01:26:40,958 --> 01:26:43,458
Uphold the honour of the lord's prayer..

1071
01:26:43,958 --> 01:26:47,458
..and He will uphold ours.

1072
01:27:21,625 --> 01:27:25,125
No!

1073
01:27:39,250 --> 01:27:40,541
Hello?

1074
01:27:41,041 --> 01:27:42,458
Just confirming is he dead?

1075
01:27:42,958 --> 01:27:44,916
Who are you?

1076
01:27:45,416 --> 01:27:48,416
Only Altaf knew where Viraj is kept.

1077
01:27:48,916 --> 01:27:51,791
But sadly..

1078
01:27:52,291 --> 01:27:55,875
..he won't be able to tell you now.

1079
01:27:56,375 --> 01:27:59,875
If you want Viraj alive, then stop searching for him.

1080
01:28:08,666 --> 01:28:12,166
15 lakhs on India.. done, sir.

1081
01:28:14,208 --> 01:28:17,750
36? Done.

1082
01:28:18,250 --> 01:28:19,166
- 50?

1083
01:28:19,666 --> 01:28:22,166
Yes sir, on India.

1084
01:28:22,666 --> 01:28:23,666
What's the situation?

1085
01:28:24,166 --> 01:28:27,208
Everybody's betting on India. If blue wins, we lose.

1086
01:28:27,708 --> 01:28:30,166
But if green wins, you'll make more than your debts.

1087
01:28:30,666 --> 01:28:34,166
You only have one option.

1088
01:28:37,625 --> 01:28:39,458
The match starts in four hours, Viraj.

1089
01:28:39,958 --> 01:28:41,333
Do you have any sense of professionalism?

1090
01:28:41,833 --> 01:28:45,416
You turned a half-hour meet into a two-day vacation.

1091
01:28:45,916 --> 01:28:48,458
Drink.

1092
01:28:48,958 --> 01:28:52,375
You're dehydrated.

1093
01:28:52,875 --> 01:28:55,333
I'm 450 crores down.

1094
01:28:55,833 --> 01:28:59,125
Nobody writes-off so much money.

1095
01:28:59,625 --> 01:29:02,625
They'll kill me and my family.

1096
01:29:03,125 --> 01:29:05,208
But if you play for me..

1097
01:29:05,708 --> 01:29:09,000
..then your family will be safe.

1098
01:29:09,500 --> 01:29:11,166
Picture this, on a lazy Sunday afternoon..

1099
01:29:11,666 --> 01:29:13,875
..your dad's reading the newspaper in the living room..

1100
01:29:14,375 --> 01:29:16,583
..the whole house is filled with the smell..

1101
01:29:17,083 --> 01:29:20,583
..of the curry your mom's preparing and.. boom!

1102
01:29:23,916 --> 01:29:26,791
LPG explosion.

1103
01:29:27,291 --> 01:29:30,166
Wagah, are you so freaked out that..

1104
01:29:30,666 --> 01:29:32,250
..you're not able to threaten boldly?

1105
01:29:32,750 --> 01:29:36,000
Take it from me.. I'll have them killed.

1106
01:29:36,500 --> 01:29:38,416
My parents are commoners.

1107
01:29:38,916 --> 01:29:43,208
They never asked me for anything, except..

1108
01:29:43,708 --> 01:29:47,166
..that I don't betray my nation.

1109
01:29:47,666 --> 01:29:51,458
They'll happily die to defeat a person like you.

1110
01:29:51,958 --> 01:29:54,708
Yes?

1111
01:29:55,208 --> 01:29:58,333
Kamlesh has arrived from Mumbai. Says he can't pay today.

1112
01:29:58,833 --> 01:30:02,333
Send him in.

1113
01:30:06,416 --> 01:30:10,791
Kamlesh, meet my friend.

1114
01:30:11,291 --> 01:30:13,125
Recognise him?

1115
01:30:13,625 --> 01:30:17,291
Don't worry, Kamlesh. You don't meet people like Viraj every day.

1116
01:30:17,791 --> 01:30:19,583
Take his autograph.

1117
01:30:20,083 --> 01:30:23,125
Sorry, Wagah, there's been a delay.

1118
01:30:23,625 --> 01:30:27,125
- I need a little more time. - You want time? Ask him for it.

1119
01:30:32,958 --> 01:30:34,291
I didn't understand.

1120
01:30:34,791 --> 01:30:38,291
If he plays for me, then I'll give you time.

1121
01:30:38,791 --> 01:30:42,291
Convince him.

1122
01:30:43,416 --> 01:30:46,208
Viraj sir, please play for him.

1123
01:30:46,708 --> 01:30:49,250
What's your answer, Viraj? Yes or no?

1124
01:30:49,750 --> 01:30:52,375
Viraj sir, please play for Wagah.

1125
01:30:52,875 --> 01:30:55,958
Viraj, Kamlesh doesn't have much time.

1126
01:30:56,458 --> 01:30:57,750
Wagah, please don't do this.

1127
01:30:58,250 --> 01:31:00,625
I'I return your money very soon.

1128
01:31:01,125 --> 01:31:02,750
Yes or no, Viraj?

1129
01:31:03,250 --> 01:31:05,083
Viraj, play for him.

1130
01:31:05,583 --> 01:31:08,458
My son is your fan, so is my entire family.

1131
01:31:08,958 --> 01:31:10,541
You play so well..

1132
01:31:11,041 --> 01:31:13,250
Just play for him..

1133
01:31:13,750 --> 01:31:17,166
Sir.. please save me.. he'll kill me..

1134
01:31:17,666 --> 01:31:21,166
- Please save him, Viraj. - Let him go.

1135
01:31:32,916 --> 01:31:36,416
Get the cabin cleaned, I'll be right back.

1136
01:31:48,500 --> 01:31:51,166
Bradman, my kid.. you're back!

1137
01:31:51,666 --> 01:31:54,333
My good luck went missing with you, dear boy!

1138
01:31:54,833 --> 01:31:58,333
We're ready.

1139
01:32:00,666 --> 01:32:02,458
Going to Mauritius for a holiday.. excited?

1140
01:32:02,958 --> 01:32:06,458
Dad, my sports day is coming up. I can't skip school.

1141
01:32:06,958 --> 01:32:10,708
There's nothing that the school can teach you and life can't.

1142
01:32:11,208 --> 01:32:12,708
Plus you can play sports anywhere.

1143
01:32:13,208 --> 01:32:15,458
For how long? First we left South Africa..

1144
01:32:15,958 --> 01:32:18,083
..then after the betting scandal, we had to flee India.

1145
01:32:18,583 --> 01:32:21,041
How long will we keep lying to him? I'm tired!

1146
01:32:21,541 --> 01:32:23,458
It's better to be tired..

1147
01:32:23,958 --> 01:32:25,583
..than dead.

1148
01:32:26,083 --> 01:32:29,583
We've to get out of here.

1149
01:32:32,666 --> 01:32:36,166
Ok, Bradman. Now you're my only kin in this world.

1150
01:32:45,958 --> 01:32:47,833
If you hadn't forced your way into Abbudin..

1151
01:32:48,333 --> 01:32:49,916
..and asked every person about Altaf..

1152
01:32:50,416 --> 01:32:51,291
..then maybe he wouldn't have been killed.

1153
01:32:51,791 --> 01:32:54,166
But without us, you wouldn't know that Altaf has a boss too.

1154
01:32:54,666 --> 01:32:55,958
Saeed, only fours hours left for the game to begin.

1155
01:32:56,458 --> 01:33:00,416
We've to find Altaf's murderer somehow. He has Viraj.

1156
01:33:00,916 --> 01:33:04,583
No need for that now, we've spoken to your External Affairs Minister.

1157
01:33:05,083 --> 01:33:06,000
We're deporting you.

1158
01:33:06,500 --> 01:33:08,750
- Sir, you can't do this. - You're currently under suspension!

1159
01:33:09,250 --> 01:33:13,458
Stay out of this.

1160
01:33:13,958 --> 01:33:16,250
Today, all roads lead to the Sheikh Hamza stadium..

1161
01:33:16,750 --> 01:33:18,333
..where India battles it out with Pakistan..

1162
01:33:18,833 --> 01:33:22,333
..in the final match of the tournament.

1163
01:33:25,416 --> 01:33:27,916
So, this is it. Hey, thanks for everything.

1164
01:33:28,416 --> 01:33:32,750
For all the troubles I caused.. I'm sorry.

1165
01:33:33,250 --> 01:33:36,750
You shouldn't apologise for your personality.

1166
01:33:43,166 --> 01:33:44,625
K, I won't be able to say goodbye.

1167
01:33:45,125 --> 01:33:47,791
Well.. nobody bids goodbye with the case unsolved.

1168
01:33:48,291 --> 01:33:51,666
Only you can solve this case now.

1169
01:33:52,166 --> 01:33:53,458
Goodbye, J.

1170
01:33:53,958 --> 01:33:55,375
Did you call me 'J'?

1171
01:33:55,875 --> 01:33:58,125
You can say the rest over the phone.

1172
01:33:58,625 --> 01:34:01,250
It's time for your flight, shall we go?

1173
01:34:01,750 --> 01:34:05,250
You.. keep an eye on Ishika. Let's go.

1174
01:34:13,208 --> 01:34:15,125
Are you too falling in love with him?

1175
01:34:15,625 --> 01:34:16,833
Yes.

1176
01:34:17,333 --> 01:34:19,583
But brotherly love.. and you?

1177
01:34:20,083 --> 01:34:24,250
Yes.. but not sisterly in any way.

1178
01:34:24,750 --> 01:34:28,708
A thief's heart was stolen and an orphan found a brother.

1179
01:34:29,208 --> 01:34:33,041
Pushpa, I hate goodbyes.

1180
01:34:33,541 --> 01:34:37,041
Kabir Shergill. He's booked on a flight to New Delhi.

1181
01:34:40,958 --> 01:34:43,333
You're flight boards from Gate 17.

1182
01:34:43,833 --> 01:34:45,458
Let's go.

1183
01:34:45,958 --> 01:34:46,833
What about us now?

1184
01:34:47,333 --> 01:34:48,791
I don't know about you, but even..

1185
01:34:49,291 --> 01:34:51,000
..dogs won't respect me after this suspension.

1186
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:55,000
That reminds me, let's see what Bradman's doing.

1187
01:35:12,083 --> 01:35:15,583
Bradman's living the good life.

1188
01:35:18,708 --> 01:35:22,208
Every dog has its day. Guess it's yours today, Bradman.

1189
01:35:40,791 --> 01:35:44,291
Slowly, Bradman. Slow down, buddy.

1190
01:35:57,208 --> 01:36:00,708
Bradman!

1191
01:36:30,666 --> 01:36:34,166
Where's Junaid?

1192
01:36:47,666 --> 01:36:49,125
Ladies and gentlemen, as we prepare for take-off..

1193
01:36:49,625 --> 01:36:53,125
..please turn off all electronic devices.

1194
01:37:05,208 --> 01:37:08,000
Look who's here.. our very own dog-catcher.

1195
01:37:08,500 --> 01:37:10,833
Thanks, friend.

1196
01:37:11,333 --> 01:37:13,666
Sir, this counter is closed and the flight is ready for take-off.

1197
01:37:14,166 --> 01:37:17,458
Ma'am, there's a hijacking threat on that flight. Let me in now.

1198
01:37:17,958 --> 01:37:21,250
I need everyone to stay calm.

1199
01:37:21,750 --> 01:37:23,708
There's a man on this flight..

1200
01:37:24,208 --> 01:37:27,833
..who shouldn't be here.

1201
01:37:28,333 --> 01:37:32,208
You, get up! Put your hands behind your head and start walking.

1202
01:37:32,708 --> 01:37:35,666
Hands up, move! This man is a state enemy..

1203
01:37:36,166 --> 01:37:37,750
..but as long as there are officers like me around..

1204
01:37:38,250 --> 01:37:40,833
- ..this city will be safe. - Shame on you!

1205
01:37:41,333 --> 01:37:43,041
Cool it.

1206
01:37:43,541 --> 01:37:46,875
And yes, don't tell anyone that Junaid Ansari rescued this plane.

1207
01:37:47,375 --> 01:37:49,083
I feel embarrassed when praised.

1208
01:37:49,583 --> 01:37:52,791
Move!

1209
01:37:53,291 --> 01:37:55,208
I'm looking for one of my officers, Junaid Ansari.

1210
01:37:55,708 --> 01:37:58,583
He just saved a Boeing 737 and left with a suspect.

1211
01:37:59,083 --> 01:38:03,083
That man's a hero.

1212
01:38:03,583 --> 01:38:07,083
What the hell! Where's my car?

1213
01:38:08,958 --> 01:38:11,250
- You forgot the keys. - Where?

1214
01:38:11,750 --> 01:38:14,458
0In your pocket.

1215
01:38:14,958 --> 01:38:18,458
Sorry.

1216
01:38:20,625 --> 01:38:22,541
Good boy!

1217
01:38:23,041 --> 01:38:26,541
It's not play-time, dear. Let me work.

1218
01:38:39,458 --> 01:38:42,958
Shit! He saw it.

1219
01:38:54,708 --> 01:38:58,208
He's kept Viraj right opposite the team's hotel.

1220
01:38:58,708 --> 01:39:02,208
Because nobody looks for lost things at home.

1221
01:39:14,583 --> 01:39:18,083
Bradman, you turned out to be Sherlock!

1222
01:39:32,416 --> 01:39:34,166
Don't come near me.

1223
01:39:34,666 --> 01:39:35,666
Who are you?

1224
01:39:36,166 --> 01:39:39,250
For the past 36 hours, we've been looking for you all over town.

1225
01:39:39,750 --> 01:39:41,166
I'm Junaid, he's Kabir.

1226
01:39:41,666 --> 01:39:46,166
We don't have time for introductions, it'll go off in 15 minutes.

1227
01:39:46,666 --> 01:39:49,041
Is anybody else there on this boat?

1228
01:39:49,541 --> 01:39:52,583
No.

1229
01:39:53,083 --> 01:39:55,250
He has fixed C4 explosives on a straitjacket.

1230
01:39:55,750 --> 01:39:57,750
It's very complicated to get out of this jacket.

1231
01:39:58,250 --> 01:40:02,208
We've to disarm the bomb.

1232
01:40:02,708 --> 01:40:04,458
- Hello? - Have you reached?

1233
01:40:04,958 --> 01:40:06,916
I just left from there.

1234
01:40:07,416 --> 01:40:09,875
I found your number on my dog's collar.

1235
01:40:10,375 --> 01:40:13,166
And the same collar led you to Viraj.

1236
01:40:13,666 --> 01:40:16,666
He's the only Bradman who plays for both teams.

1237
01:40:17,166 --> 01:40:18,666
What do you want?

1238
01:40:19,166 --> 01:40:22,000
You can't give me what I want.

1239
01:40:22,500 --> 01:40:24,333
I'll give you a task that you can handle.

1240
01:40:24,833 --> 01:40:28,208
There's a speedboat outside. Take Viraj for a ride on that.

1241
01:40:28,708 --> 01:40:32,208
I'll explain the rest there.

1242
01:40:36,958 --> 01:40:39,333
Only ten minutes left, what do you want us to do next?

1243
01:40:39,833 --> 01:40:42,416
I've heard rumours in the market that India has sent..

1244
01:40:42,916 --> 01:40:45,166
..a top-level officer for this case.

1245
01:40:45,666 --> 01:40:47,416
- Am I talking to him? -Tell me.

1246
01:40:47,916 --> 01:40:50,000
Kabir..

1247
01:40:50,500 --> 01:40:52,875
You work too hard for very little salary.

1248
01:40:53,375 --> 01:40:55,375
I'm messaging you an account number.

1249
01:40:55,875 --> 01:40:57,291
Use your high-profile contacts and..

1250
01:40:57,791 --> 01:40:59,208
..get 500 crores transferred into my account.

1251
01:40:59,708 --> 01:41:01,666
There are two benefits to it.

1252
01:41:02,166 --> 01:41:03,375
Viraj will be saved..

1253
01:41:03,875 --> 01:41:07,208
..and your salary too will increase by a few hundreds.

1254
01:41:07,708 --> 01:41:10,625
Kabir, what's going on there? Why didn't you take that flight?

1255
01:41:11,125 --> 01:41:14,166
- Ma'am, it's about Viraj. - Please say that he's alive.

1256
01:41:14,666 --> 01:41:15,833
Only for the next eight minutes.

1257
01:41:16,333 --> 01:41:20,458
There's a bomb on him and only one way to disarm it.

1258
01:41:20,958 --> 01:41:21,833
What's the ransom?

1259
01:41:22,333 --> 01:41:25,166
He's asking for 500 crores as if it's a box of candies.

1260
01:41:25,666 --> 01:41:28,000
If you can't arrange it, I'll blow up Viraj.

1261
01:41:28,500 --> 01:41:30,666
Everything's been arranged. It will be transferred to your account.

1262
01:41:31,166 --> 01:41:33,000
Tell him to shut down the bomb or..

1263
01:41:33,500 --> 01:41:36,958
..we'll reach Gateway of India at this speed.

1264
01:41:37,458 --> 01:41:38,666
Hurry up, Kabir.

1265
01:41:39,166 --> 01:41:42,000
I have a lot of time, but sadly, Viraj doesn't.

1266
01:41:42,500 --> 01:41:46,000
Don't be the reason for India's favourite son becoming a martyr.

1267
01:41:55,833 --> 01:42:00,416
Stop the boat!

1268
01:42:00,916 --> 01:42:02,291
Only three minutes left.

1269
01:42:02,791 --> 01:42:08,333
Nothing can happen now. Jump off! Get away, guys!

1270
01:42:08,833 --> 01:42:11,708
For the first time, the Indian government has kept its word.

1271
01:42:12,208 --> 01:42:14,041
- You keep your word.. - And disarm the bomb!

1272
01:42:14,541 --> 01:42:16,708
The bomb will be disarmed when the money comes in.

1273
01:42:17,208 --> 01:42:20,291
Trust me, not that you have an option.

1274
01:42:20,791 --> 01:42:23,291
Kabir, we must do something. There has to be a way out.

1275
01:42:23,791 --> 01:42:25,625
Good news for the fans. It's a batting wicket..

1276
01:42:26,125 --> 01:42:27,791
..and we should expect a high-scoring contest.

1277
01:42:28,291 --> 01:42:31,458
Viraj Sharma hasn't been seen near the nets. So the big question is..

1278
01:42:31,958 --> 01:42:35,458
..will he play today's game or not?

1279
01:42:39,916 --> 01:42:43,916
Thank you, Kabir. I haven't found a better friend than you.

1280
01:42:44,416 --> 01:42:49,375
You paid off my 500 crore debt for our 5-minute old friendship.

1281
01:42:49,875 --> 01:42:52,666
There's only one thing that is respected in my business..

1282
01:42:53,166 --> 01:42:54,125
..one's word.

1283
01:42:54,625 --> 01:42:58,333
And I've given word that Viraj won't be playing today.

1284
01:42:58,833 --> 01:43:00,666
So the bomb..

1285
01:43:01,166 --> 01:43:02,375
..can't be disarmed.

1286
01:43:02,875 --> 01:43:04,958
Don't tell Viraj, he'll feel bad.

1287
01:43:05,458 --> 01:43:06,958
I regret that we couldn't meet.

1288
01:43:07,458 --> 01:43:10,958
Tell Junaid Ansari that now on, Bradman belongs to him.

1289
01:43:11,458 --> 01:43:13,208
I'll hang up.

1290
01:43:13,708 --> 01:43:15,000
What did he say?

1291
01:43:15,500 --> 01:43:19,000
Speak up, Kabir.

1292
01:43:41,541 --> 01:43:42,833
There's delay over something.

1293
01:43:43,333 --> 01:43:45,416
Even the captains haven't stepped out for the toss.

1294
01:43:45,916 --> 01:43:48,208
Even the Indian team's playing eleven hasn't been decided.

1295
01:43:48,708 --> 01:43:51,875
It seems there are some questions over Viraj Sharma's fitness.

1296
01:43:52,375 --> 01:43:55,416
We're all gonna lose our jobs because of Junaid Ansari.

1297
01:43:55,916 --> 01:43:57,708
It's my mistake.

1298
01:43:58,208 --> 01:44:01,375
I should have never recruited him.

1299
01:44:01,875 --> 01:44:05,791
Ma'am, Kabir Shergill's phone isn't reachable.

1300
01:44:06,291 --> 01:44:09,791
Call for a press conference. The world needs to know.

1301
01:44:23,833 --> 01:44:25,291
Did they toss, buddy?

1302
01:44:25,791 --> 01:44:27,041
India's batting. What do you think?

1303
01:44:27,541 --> 01:44:30,458
Who will win?

1304
01:44:30,958 --> 01:44:33,958
I'll win.

1305
01:44:34,458 --> 01:44:36,458
Cricket lovers of the world are waiting eagerly.

1306
01:44:36,958 --> 01:44:38,666
Atul, such games aren't a daily affair.

1307
01:44:39,166 --> 01:44:41,166
After all, it's India vs Pakistan.

1308
01:44:41,666 --> 01:44:45,541
Viraj! Viraj!

1309
01:44:46,041 --> 01:44:50,458
Calm down, boy. Viraj won't be playing today.

1310
01:44:50,958 --> 01:44:54,458
Sorry.

1311
01:44:55,708 --> 01:45:01,458
Hello. There's no betting happening here. You've got the wrong number.

1312
01:45:01,958 --> 01:45:04,708
- Uncle! Uncle! - What is it?

1313
01:45:05,208 --> 01:45:08,708
Viraj!

1314
01:45:48,375 --> 01:45:49,666
What did he say?

1315
01:45:50,166 --> 01:45:53,666
Speak up, Kabir.

1316
01:45:55,541 --> 01:45:57,750
Idea!

1317
01:45:58,250 --> 01:46:01,291
The magician Harry Houdini was famous for getting out of such jackets.

1318
01:46:01,791 --> 01:46:04,041
- How? - By dislocating his shoulder.

1319
01:46:04,541 --> 01:46:08,458
Which shoulder did you injure in the semi-final?

1320
01:46:08,958 --> 01:46:12,708
- Right shoulder. - Sorry, man.

1321
01:46:13,208 --> 01:46:16,708
For the first time, I'm beating up someone to save them.

1322
01:46:56,375 --> 01:46:58,458
Great news for the Indian fans all over the world.

1323
01:46:58,958 --> 01:47:01,708
Viraj Sharma is fit and will open for India.

1324
01:47:02,208 --> 01:47:05,375
A big relief for me as well as for India as Viraj is India's biggest asset..

1325
01:47:05,875 --> 01:47:09,375
..and it was important that he played this big match.

1326
01:47:14,833 --> 01:47:16,583
By scoring a boundary on the first ball..

1327
01:47:17,083 --> 01:47:18,833
..Viraj Sharma has made his intentions clear.

1328
01:47:19,333 --> 01:47:21,541
This guy is in lethal form.

1329
01:47:22,041 --> 01:47:26,166
My parents are commoners. They never asked me for anything.

1330
01:47:26,666 --> 01:47:28,458
Except that..

1331
01:47:28,958 --> 01:47:32,416
..I should never betray my nation.

1332
01:47:32,916 --> 01:47:35,750
Hey, sit down. Even I've paid for the tickets.

1333
01:47:36,250 --> 01:47:38,041
Don't you touch me!

1334
01:47:38,541 --> 01:47:39,791
Junaid, we've just received information..

1335
01:47:40,291 --> 01:47:43,791
..your suspect is heading towards exit no. 4 in a yellow sedan.

1336
01:47:54,583 --> 01:47:57,625
I think it's his timing that is so pure.

1337
01:47:58,125 --> 01:48:00,625
And the way he's meeting the ball in the middle of the bat..

1338
01:48:01,125 --> 01:48:04,166
..that is so good to watch.

1339
01:48:04,666 --> 01:48:06,791
The way he plays the ball on his on-side..

1340
01:48:07,291 --> 01:48:10,791
..it's difficult to evade him.

1341
01:48:24,666 --> 01:48:26,583
His body language is very good.

1342
01:48:27,083 --> 01:48:30,000
He's in aggressive form.

1343
01:48:30,500 --> 01:48:34,000
Lower! Lower!

1344
01:48:46,666 --> 01:48:50,166
After that shot, I think he's unstoppable.

1345
01:49:56,916 --> 01:49:58,375
Sam, don't get up as long as Viraj's on the crease..

1346
01:49:58,875 --> 01:50:00,583
..this is our lucky position.

1347
01:50:01,083 --> 01:50:06,000
Wonder if those cute cops found his phone and wallet!

1348
01:50:06,500 --> 01:50:10,000
Wagah!

1349
01:50:13,958 --> 01:50:17,625
Kabir, tell him to get lower.

1350
01:50:18,125 --> 01:50:21,625
Down.. down.. lower!

1351
01:50:27,500 --> 01:50:31,000
Lower.. lower, Kabir!

1352
01:50:52,916 --> 01:50:55,291
Shut up!

1353
01:50:55,791 --> 01:50:57,791
K, how long is he going to be sentenced for?

1354
01:50:58,291 --> 01:50:59,958
Junaid, he's done for!

1355
01:51:00,458 --> 01:51:03,166
I just wanna whack him for the fun of it.

1356
01:51:03,666 --> 01:51:05,083
But he'll fall if you do that.

1357
01:51:05,583 --> 01:51:08,250
Sorry, let's drop the idea. We'll kick him instead.

1358
01:51:08,750 --> 01:51:10,375
Yours is longer than mine, you kick him.

1359
01:51:10,875 --> 01:51:12,333
I'll dismantle all his joints once I get off.

1360
01:51:12,833 --> 01:51:14,041
Hey pilot, pull over!

1361
01:51:14,541 --> 01:51:18,041
We want to rip him apart!

1362
01:51:38,250 --> 01:51:40,041
K, you know, 20 years ago..

1363
01:51:40,541 --> 01:51:44,541
..my parents left for Lucknow on Bakri Eid day.

1364
01:51:45,041 --> 01:51:47,791
Their flight hasn't reached yet.

1365
01:51:48,291 --> 01:51:51,000
And today, god's given me a brother.

1366
01:51:51,500 --> 01:51:53,000
But only for 36 hours.

1367
01:51:53,500 --> 01:51:55,750
That means, you've decided that my flight will never reach.

1368
01:51:56,250 --> 01:51:57,958
No, pal..

1369
01:51:58,458 --> 01:52:03,166
But today, I want to say something which nobody has told you before.

1370
01:52:03,666 --> 01:52:04,416
I miss you, man.

1371
01:52:04,916 --> 01:52:08,458
I can't believe that I'm going to say this.

1372
01:52:08,958 --> 01:52:10,208
I'll miss you too.

1373
01:52:10,708 --> 01:52:14,208
Don't get too emotional now. It doesn't suit your body.

1374
01:52:25,416 --> 01:52:27,208
Well, K, if you miss me too much..

1375
01:52:27,708 --> 01:52:29,291
..then don't bury yourself in the pillow and cry.

1376
01:52:29,791 --> 01:52:30,833
Just give me a call, bro.

1377
01:52:31,333 --> 01:52:36,166
You too. But don't keep redialling if I reject the call.

1378
01:52:36,666 --> 01:52:40,041
Look, there comes the 'Smart Alec' of our department.

1379
01:52:40,541 --> 01:52:43,458
Kabir, one last job for you. We're deporting her to India.

1380
01:52:43,958 --> 01:52:45,458
Can't you ever bring good news, Mr. Saeed?

1381
01:52:45,958 --> 01:52:48,583
You.. come and collect your badge and gun tomorrow.

1382
01:52:49,083 --> 01:52:50,458
Difficult tomorrow, I'll come the day after.

1383
01:52:50,958 --> 01:52:54,000
These big cases exhaust me.

1384
01:52:54,500 --> 01:52:56,458
Thank you for everything, Saeed.

1385
01:52:56,958 --> 01:53:00,458
I hope never to meet you again.

1386
01:53:00,958 --> 01:53:03,250
Ishika..

1387
01:53:03,750 --> 01:53:06,375
Henceforth, stop changing names, change your vocation instead.

1388
01:53:06,875 --> 01:53:07,666
And listen..

1389
01:53:08,166 --> 01:53:10,833
Tyson may not be able to say it, but he's interested.

1390
01:53:11,333 --> 01:53:14,083
I'll think about it.

1391
01:53:14,583 --> 01:53:18,083
Take care.

1392
01:53:20,458 --> 01:53:23,958
Don't smoke please.

1393
01:53:26,333 --> 01:53:29,458
Do you want to fall sick again? Junaid told me about your problem.

1394
01:53:29,958 --> 01:53:31,583
Your testicles have just healed..

1395
01:53:32,083 --> 01:53:34,208
..now you want to destroy your lungs?!

1396
01:53:34,708 --> 01:53:36,875
What else did Junaid tell you about me?

1397
01:53:37,375 --> 01:53:38,791
I didn't ask much.

1398
01:53:39,291 --> 01:53:40,708
I want to hear it from you.

1399
01:53:41,208 --> 01:53:43,583
So, tell me..

1400
01:53:44,083 --> 01:53:45,541
"Four bottles of vodka.."

1401
01:53:46,041 --> 01:53:47,416
"..my daily affair."

1402
01:53:47,916 --> 01:53:48,958
"Nobody stops.."

1403
01:53:49,458 --> 01:53:50,458
Qureshi speaking.

1404
01:53:50,958 --> 01:53:53,166
My old servant saw your photo..

1405
01:53:53,666 --> 01:53:55,708
..he loved the suit.

1406
01:53:56,208 --> 01:53:58,708
But he didn't like the man at all.

1407
01:53:59,208 --> 01:54:00,125
Thank you, sir. Bye.

1408
01:54:00,625 --> 01:54:03,583
Just a minute.. do you have video calling on your phone?

1409
01:54:04,083 --> 01:54:07,583
I look equally bad on video too, uncle. See!

1410
01:54:11,625 --> 01:54:12,833
Hello.

1411
01:54:13,333 --> 01:54:14,208
Hello.

1412
01:54:14,708 --> 01:54:16,250
I'm Muskaan.

1413
01:54:16,750 --> 01:54:19,583
My entire family saw your photo.

1414
01:54:20,083 --> 01:54:23,583
And nobody liked me?

1415
01:54:25,125 --> 01:54:27,708
Except me.

1416
01:54:28,208 --> 01:54:30,791
- Can we meet? - Why?

1417
01:54:31,291 --> 01:54:34,166
Just like that. I wanted to know you better.

1418
01:54:34,666 --> 01:54:38,166
What if I don't like you?

1419
01:54:48,916 --> 01:54:52,416
I do! I do! I do!

1420
01:54:56,500 --> 01:55:00,000
Muskaan, I'm coming to India. Don't you hang up!

1421
01:55:42,583 --> 01:55:43,958
"Your mother.."

1422
01:55:44,458 --> 01:55:45,916
"My mummy.."

1423
01:55:46,416 --> 01:55:47,666
"Your father.."

1424
01:55:48,166 --> 01:55:49,583
"My daddy.."

1425
01:55:50,083 --> 01:55:51,375
"Your aunt.."

1426
01:55:51,875 --> 01:55:53,333
"My aunt.."

1427
01:55:53,833 --> 01:55:56,875
"Your brother, my brother-in-law."

1428
01:55:57,375 --> 01:56:00,333
"All the accusations hold true in love."

1429
01:56:00,833 --> 01:56:04,083
"I've thought of some good names."

1430
01:56:04,583 --> 01:56:09,208
"In two years, you'll bear children, my children."

1431
01:56:09,708 --> 01:56:12,875
"Come, O beloved!"

1432
01:56:13,375 --> 01:56:14,666
"Come into my arms!"

1433
01:56:15,166 --> 01:56:16,625
"Come, O beloved!"

1434
01:56:17,125 --> 01:56:18,375
"Come, O beloved!"

1435
01:56:18,875 --> 01:56:20,000
"Come, O beloved!"

1436
01:56:20,500 --> 01:56:22,166
"Come into my arms!"

1437
01:56:22,666 --> 01:56:26,166
"Come, O beloved!"

1438
01:56:41,625 --> 01:56:44,666
"I'll carry all your shopping bags."

1439
01:56:45,166 --> 01:56:48,458
"I'll drop the children to school daily."

1440
01:56:48,958 --> 01:56:52,083
"But I'll forget our anniversary."

1441
01:56:52,583 --> 01:56:55,875
"Say that you agree to it."

1442
01:56:56,375 --> 01:56:59,458
"Promise that I'll go on vacation every year."

1443
01:56:59,958 --> 01:57:03,166
"I'll get a great gift, no matter what."

1444
01:57:03,666 --> 01:57:06,916
"If you make me cry, you'll get burnt curry."

1445
01:57:07,416 --> 01:57:10,625
"Say that you agree to it."

1446
01:57:11,125 --> 01:57:13,791
"My promises hold true forever."

1447
01:57:14,291 --> 01:57:17,458
"Your darling is not a weak man."

1448
01:57:17,958 --> 01:57:22,625
"In two years, you'll bear children, my children."

1449
01:57:23,125 --> 01:57:26,250
"Come, O beloved!"

1450
01:57:26,750 --> 01:57:28,041
"Come into my arms."

1451
01:57:28,541 --> 01:57:30,000
"Come, O beloved!"

1452
01:57:30,500 --> 01:57:31,791

"I'll wait for you every evening."

1457
01:57:57,208 --> 01:58:00,375
"I'll make sure we're late for the movie."

1458
01:58:00,875 --> 01:58:04,083
"I'll date you like this all my life."

1459
01:58:04,583 --> 01:58:07,833
"Darling, this is what I've decided."

1460
01:58:08,333 --> 01:58:11,583
"I'll skip my friends' parties."

1461
01:58:12,083 --> 01:58:15,291
"I'll break the heart of all my exes."

1462
01:58:15,791 --> 01:58:18,666
"I'll stitch the buttons on your shirt."

1463
01:58:19,166 --> 01:58:22,416
"Darling, I too have decided."

1464
01:58:22,916 --> 01:58:25,791
"There are a few good deeds left."

1465
01:58:26,291 --> 01:58:29,458
"You think of some good names too."

1466
01:58:29,958 --> 01:58:34,666

"Come, O beloved!"

1470
01:58:42,583 --> 01:58:43,750
"Come, O beloved!"

1471
01:58:44,250 --> 01:58:45,625
"Come, O beloved!"

1472
01:58:46,125 --> 01:58:47,291
