1
00:05:00,476 --> 00:05:02,478
God bless us...

2
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:06,816
I'm grateful to all those
who have come here.

3
00:05:06,816 --> 00:05:13,823
Our Delhi Malayali association is a victory
for the unity & the love between Malayalis.

4
00:05:13,823 --> 00:05:18,494
Adding respect always to
our Malayali community,

5
00:05:18,494 --> 00:05:21,430
Honorable Supreme Court
justice Mr. Viiswanatha Menon,

6
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:24,967
who is a member
of our association.

7
00:05:24,967 --> 00:05:30,606
At this time has retired
& leaving for his native...

8
00:05:30,606 --> 00:05:36,145
Who has gained our love & has come
here because of his love towards us...

9
00:05:36,145 --> 00:05:40,639
And to his wife Bharathi Amma,
let God bless them with everything.

10
00:05:43,452 --> 00:05:52,595
Let God grant him happiness,
peace, health & long life,

11
00:05:52,595 --> 00:05:57,692
when he lives with his family
& grand children.

12
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,982
Who said? Things that should
happen did not happen.

13
00:06:12,982 --> 00:06:15,618
Party is deciding
the State Minister.

14
00:06:15,618 --> 00:06:17,219
Speak softly.

15
00:06:17,219 --> 00:06:19,322
Mathew sir is getting ready.

16
00:06:19,322 --> 00:06:21,023
Must go before
the bad time starts.

17
00:06:21,023 --> 00:06:22,285
He is going straight
to the Raj Bhavan.

18
00:06:28,264 --> 00:06:29,699
Sister-in-law,
this is Madhavan.

19
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:30,900
Is Balan brother there?

20
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,435
Yes, I'll give it to him.

21
00:06:32,435 --> 00:06:34,103
Balan dear...
Who?

22
00:06:34,103 --> 00:06:35,092
Madhavan.

23
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:37,873
What?

24
00:06:37,873 --> 00:06:39,308
Is there nobody
at the house?

25
00:06:39,308 --> 00:06:40,676
Nobody took the phone,
when I called.

26
00:06:40,676 --> 00:06:42,311
I also tried many times.

27
00:06:42,311 --> 00:06:43,412
...Nobody took the phone.

28
00:06:43,412 --> 00:06:45,348
Where has that mental
Kutty Krishnan gone?

29
00:06:45,348 --> 00:06:46,582
Does he have any
mobile number?

30
00:06:46,582 --> 00:06:49,518
Brother-in-law, do you
know his mobile number?

31
00:06:49,518 --> 00:06:52,455
He has 3, 4 mobiles
but has no connection.

32
00:06:52,455 --> 00:06:53,990
No.

33
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:56,926
Father will be coming
home next week.

34
00:06:56,926 --> 00:06:59,228
Don't forget he'll be very strict
here than in the court.

35
00:06:59,228 --> 00:06:59,929
Where are you now?

36
00:06:59,929 --> 00:07:01,297
I am at Trivandrum.

37
00:07:01,297 --> 00:07:03,299
Our party's new Minister is going
to take charge today.

38
00:07:03,299 --> 00:07:05,267
Brother, you do one thing.

39
00:07:05,267 --> 00:07:07,103
You take Sekar brother-in-law
with you & go to our house.

40
00:07:07,103 --> 00:07:07,637
Ok.

41
00:07:07,637 --> 00:07:08,899
Right.

42
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,909
Why you are in tension, will the taking
charge of the post take place today?

43
00:07:13,909 --> 00:07:16,512
Not that, my father is coming
from Delhi.

44
00:07:16,512 --> 00:07:18,781
Is that the matter,
it is happy news.

45
00:07:18,781 --> 00:07:21,617
I & Balan brother have not been
to the house for months.

46
00:07:21,617 --> 00:07:25,388
Can't blame you because
you don't find time.

47
00:07:25,388 --> 00:07:26,422
You may go...

48
00:07:26,422 --> 00:07:29,291
If I delay in taking oath,
I'll be dragged down.

49
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:31,127
Then, we won't have
a Minister for our party.

50
00:07:31,127 --> 00:07:32,628
You get in... go...

51
00:07:32,628 --> 00:07:35,597
Those boys are a nuisance.

52
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:38,234
You move...

53
00:07:38,234 --> 00:07:38,868
Then the house...

54
00:07:38,868 --> 00:07:40,302
I have asked Balan brother
to take care of it.

55
00:07:40,302 --> 00:07:42,271
Without the party secretary,
what is the oath taking ceremony?

56
00:07:42,271 --> 00:07:43,295
You are right.

57
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:11,701
What is nobody here?

58
00:08:11,701 --> 00:08:12,401
Am I not here?

59
00:08:12,401 --> 00:08:13,669
Other than you,
isn't there anybody else?

60
00:08:13,669 --> 00:08:14,170
Aren't you here?

61
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:16,605
Isn't there no one
to attend phone here?

62
00:08:16,605 --> 00:08:18,474
I am here to take it,
but I can't take it.

63
00:08:18,474 --> 00:08:18,974
Why?

64
00:08:18,974 --> 00:08:20,176
House is locked.

65
00:08:20,176 --> 00:08:22,111
Where has this
Kutty Krishnan gone?

66
00:08:22,111 --> 00:08:25,915
I was hearing his voice in the old
car of the judge, till yesterday.

67
00:08:25,915 --> 00:08:28,384
He did something to the car.

68
00:08:28,384 --> 00:08:32,521
I saw him taking the car to the workshop
tied to a lorry this morning.

69
00:08:32,521 --> 00:08:33,522
Give me the key of the house.

70
00:08:33,522 --> 00:08:35,925
Since he didn't believe me,
he didn't give the key to me.

71
00:08:35,925 --> 00:08:41,597
Since he is absent minded, to keep the key
safely I saw him throwing the key inside.

72
00:08:41,597 --> 00:08:42,898
What a nuisance?

73
00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:45,501
Didn't his madness reduce yet,
is he taking his tablets or not?

74
00:08:45,501 --> 00:08:47,236
He used to take all the tablets
once in a month

75
00:08:47,236 --> 00:08:48,637
...instead of taking it everyday,
as he is lazy.

76
00:08:48,637 --> 00:08:51,574
On that day, he will be a little normal,
but he would sleep the whole day.

77
00:08:51,574 --> 00:08:53,209
Why didn't you tell him?

78
00:08:53,209 --> 00:08:55,044
He won't listen to anyone...

79
00:08:55,044 --> 00:08:57,774
But he won't listen
to me at all.

80
00:09:03,953 --> 00:09:07,423
This only will happen, when we ask
the crazy people to take care of the house.

81
00:09:07,423 --> 00:09:11,227
Because of the sympathy that he had
worked as a clerk, father is keeping him here.

82
00:09:11,227 --> 00:09:12,421
Now, we are suffering.

83
00:09:14,597 --> 00:09:16,758
There, Kutty Krishnan is coming.

84
00:09:22,438 --> 00:09:24,039
What are you doing there?

85
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:25,875
Where had you been
locking the house?

86
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:27,543
Locking the house is
now the mistake.

87
00:09:27,543 --> 00:09:29,111
...Last time you blamed me for
leaving the house unlocked.

88
00:09:29,111 --> 00:09:31,413
It won't be fair if you talk
adversely every time.

89
00:09:31,413 --> 00:09:32,481
Should be constant always.

90
00:09:32,481 --> 00:09:34,350
What are you doing
with a stick?

91
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:34,984
I am taking the key.

92
00:09:34,984 --> 00:09:36,418
If you had told me,
I would have given it.

93
00:09:36,418 --> 00:09:38,420
He thinks that he is a genius,
because he is having a beard.

94
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,588
What to do when
he is confused in the head?

95
00:09:39,588 --> 00:09:41,624
How is my plan?

96
00:09:41,624 --> 00:09:42,958
You don't come by this way.

97
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:44,960
I'll come & open that door.

98
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,796
You were having your arm inside,
did you take it?

99
00:09:46,796 --> 00:09:48,397
Your arm is here.

100
00:09:48,397 --> 00:09:50,533
With whose permission,
did you put your arm inside?

101
00:09:50,533 --> 00:09:52,034
How did I become
so sensible?

102
00:09:52,034 --> 00:09:54,537
Here, here is the key.

103
00:09:54,537 --> 00:09:58,507
This won't be my idea
next time.

104
00:09:58,507 --> 00:10:00,142
Do you know about
father's coming?

105
00:10:00,142 --> 00:10:03,979
I saw it in the T.V & news paper,
that's why I repaired the car.

106
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:06,081
If you lock everything,
where are the other servants?

107
00:10:06,081 --> 00:10:06,849
I have eaten them.

108
00:10:06,849 --> 00:10:10,085
He beat the cook with the coconut scraper
& chased him. He lost his 4 teeth.

109
00:10:10,085 --> 00:10:12,655
He is worried about the teeth, but not
about the broken coconut scraper.

110
00:10:12,655 --> 00:10:16,559
It is very dirty here,
where is the cleaning woman?

111
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:17,193
I sent her back.

112
00:10:17,193 --> 00:10:19,094
He pushed her out by her neck.

113
00:10:19,094 --> 00:10:20,863
Why are you behaving like this?

114
00:10:20,863 --> 00:10:24,300
That's right, I didn't expect this much
demand for that woman.

115
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,335
It's true I chased her...

116
00:10:26,335 --> 00:10:29,471
Or she would have given birth
to a child in his resemblance...

117
00:10:29,471 --> 00:10:30,906
He has got
the energy for that.

118
00:10:30,906 --> 00:10:31,574
Don't I have?

119
00:10:31,574 --> 00:10:32,708
I'll slap you...

120
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:37,847
Before father comes, his sons, his grand
children & all the relations will come...

121
00:10:37,847 --> 00:10:40,216
Everybody's "Viishu" celebration
will be here only.

122
00:10:40,216 --> 00:10:44,086
To clean & sweep, 4, 5 servants
are required.

123
00:10:44,086 --> 00:10:45,053
Do you understand?
Yes.

124
00:10:57,199 --> 00:10:58,534
See who is coming?

125
00:10:58,534 --> 00:10:59,869
Kutty Krishnan?

126
00:10:59,869 --> 00:11:01,337
I didn't see you for
a long time...

127
00:11:01,337 --> 00:11:03,138
Judge is coming here.

128
00:11:03,138 --> 00:11:05,608
Is it? Remove all the old things...

129
00:11:05,608 --> 00:11:10,102
Not here... Is he coming here to eat steam
cake & Papad? He won't come here.

130
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:14,049
What is this?

131
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:15,718
Steam cake.

132
00:11:15,718 --> 00:11:18,053
Its better you would have gone
to the Jim to exercise.

133
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:21,891
Look at his arrogance of serving
a piece of steam cake...

134
00:11:21,891 --> 00:11:25,527
Kuruppu, Judge will not stay
at Delhi anymore.

135
00:11:25,527 --> 00:11:27,129
He is going to stay only here.

136
00:11:27,129 --> 00:11:27,963
Sit down.

137
00:11:27,963 --> 00:11:31,467
For that for the house hold work & the
outside work, 3, 4 servants are required.

138
00:11:31,467 --> 00:11:32,034
Yes.

139
00:11:32,034 --> 00:11:34,169
If you know anybody,
send them there.

140
00:11:34,169 --> 00:11:35,604
If it could be a Brahmin
it will be safe.

141
00:11:35,604 --> 00:11:37,439
I'll take care of it.

142
00:11:37,439 --> 00:11:44,380
By the way, there are many valuable
things & large vessels in the house...

143
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,715
So, the servants should
be most reliable...

144
00:11:46,715 --> 00:11:48,250
...Shouldn't be thieves.

145
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,182
I'll arrange.

146
00:11:52,922 --> 00:11:56,483
He is a thief who is able to open
any type of lock... A big thief.

147
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:22,244
Ottu Murali, he is a big thief
who steals metal vessels.

148
00:12:25,454 --> 00:12:29,618
He is rat Vasu, he digs anywhere like
a rat & steals everything.

149
00:12:31,927 --> 00:12:35,464
She is Para Mary,
she prefers gold earrings...

150
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:36,966
When she sees,
she'll steal it immediately.

151
00:12:36,966 --> 00:12:38,968
Come quickly.

152
00:12:38,968 --> 00:12:40,336
Good day sir...

153
00:12:40,336 --> 00:12:41,870
Good day.

154
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:42,771
You are the Judge, right?

155
00:12:42,771 --> 00:12:45,207
You may think like that
on seeing my reputation

156
00:12:45,207 --> 00:12:47,443
& respect in this house,
but I am not the judge.

157
00:12:47,443 --> 00:12:48,243
Who are you?

158
00:12:48,243 --> 00:12:49,478
We are also not the Judge.

159
00:12:49,478 --> 00:12:51,647
I didn't ask you that,
who are you?

160
00:12:51,647 --> 00:12:52,881
Kuruppu at the tea
shop has sent us here...

161
00:12:52,881 --> 00:12:53,882
Original Brahmins.

162
00:12:53,882 --> 00:12:55,918
Want to see
the sacred thread?

163
00:12:55,918 --> 00:12:58,087
What is the woman's name,
who mistook me for the Judge?

164
00:12:58,087 --> 00:13:01,256
Sornamma Andharjanam,
an original 916 hallmark.

165
00:13:01,256 --> 00:13:06,295
She is very talented in saying
about the quality of gold jewellery...

166
00:13:06,295 --> 00:13:08,297
I didn't call her
for the gold job...

167
00:13:08,297 --> 00:13:10,599
...I called her only for the kitchen work...
Do you know to do anything?

168
00:13:10,599 --> 00:13:11,834
She knows to plug you...

169
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:14,136
He means that
she'll cook very well...

170
00:13:14,136 --> 00:13:16,672
She knows to prepare from rice
& curry to tea & coffee...

171
00:13:16,672 --> 00:13:17,573
What is your name?

172
00:13:17,573 --> 00:13:18,507
Poottu Varghese...

173
00:13:18,507 --> 00:13:19,074
Poottu Varghese?

174
00:13:19,074 --> 00:13:23,412
It's not that, Puttu Varghese,
Rice puttu, Sooji puttu etc.

175
00:13:23,412 --> 00:13:24,847
He doesn't need
a key for any lock.

176
00:13:24,847 --> 00:13:28,350
No need for ghee
to prepare Puttu, isn't it?

177
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,185
Where is the "Odu" here?

178
00:13:30,185 --> 00:13:30,886
On top of the house...

179
00:13:30,886 --> 00:13:32,521
Not that, the vessels
made of metal...

180
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:32,955
Why?

181
00:13:32,955 --> 00:13:34,456
To give the judge to eat.

182
00:13:34,456 --> 00:13:36,625
Do you want to give the judge
metal vessels to eat?

183
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:38,093
I suspect you,
what is your name?

184
00:13:38,093 --> 00:13:39,495
Ottu Murali.

185
00:13:39,495 --> 00:13:40,863
Ottu Murali...

186
00:13:40,863 --> 00:13:43,098
I'll tell you,
his name is Murali...

187
00:13:43,098 --> 00:13:45,367
He is a good person, can't you
recognize from his colour?

188
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:46,168
How could I believe?

189
00:13:46,168 --> 00:13:47,069
I give assurance for him.

190
00:13:47,069 --> 00:13:47,703
Then for you?

191
00:13:47,703 --> 00:13:48,604
I give assurance...

192
00:13:48,604 --> 00:13:49,238
Then for him?

193
00:13:49,238 --> 00:13:50,039
I assure him...

194
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:50,939
Then for you?

195
00:13:50,939 --> 00:13:51,997
I guarantee for her.

196
00:13:54,977 --> 00:13:58,614
Watchman, you need not watch her,
it's enough if you watch there.

197
00:13:58,614 --> 00:14:00,482
I'll take responsibility
in her matter.

198
00:14:00,482 --> 00:14:02,245
Go... enter the cage...

199
00:14:04,453 --> 00:14:06,388
Sornamma...
What sir?

200
00:14:06,388 --> 00:14:07,623
Go inside...
Ok sir.

201
00:14:07,623 --> 00:14:08,857
Hey! Come here.

202
00:14:08,857 --> 00:14:09,458
What is your name?

203
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:12,061
V.M. Perichazhi...
No... Periyasamy...

204
00:14:12,061 --> 00:14:13,262
Go...
Come...

205
00:14:13,262 --> 00:14:14,194
Don't act.

206
00:14:19,301 --> 00:14:20,169
Shobha sister...

207
00:14:20,169 --> 00:14:21,203
Ganesh has not come yet...

208
00:14:21,203 --> 00:14:23,739
He'll go to Bangalore directly from
Bombay, he'll come only tomorrow.

209
00:14:23,739 --> 00:14:27,976
Madhavan's father didn't like to come
from Delhi, mother only compelled him.

210
00:14:27,976 --> 00:14:29,311
Who has gone to the Airport?

211
00:14:29,311 --> 00:14:30,801
Madhavan brother
& Balan brother, why?

212
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:35,250
It is a 10 sovereign chain,
where did you buy?

213
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:35,918
From Josco...

214
00:14:35,918 --> 00:14:37,818
No.1- 916 Hallmark...

215
00:14:38,587 --> 00:14:40,389
Will fetch a good
amount if sold.

216
00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:42,124
Good weight & good price...

217
00:14:42,124 --> 00:14:43,557
Mother! Good day...

218
00:14:44,593 --> 00:14:45,160
Who is that, sister?

219
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,863
She is a new servant
Sornamma Andharjanam.

220
00:14:47,863 --> 00:14:48,997
You mean Brahmin?

221
00:14:48,997 --> 00:14:51,200
If they come to know that
I'm not a Brahmin, Mother...

222
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,735
Don't go there after eating fish
& mutton. They smell it.

223
00:14:53,735 --> 00:14:54,667
Here...

224
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:58,466
Sister...

225
00:14:59,408 --> 00:15:00,042
What?

226
00:15:00,042 --> 00:15:02,144
My two rings, I kept
on the table are missing.

227
00:15:02,144 --> 00:15:04,635
It'll be somewhere there. You might not
have seen it properly, come...

228
00:15:05,681 --> 00:15:06,782
You will get...

229
00:15:06,782 --> 00:15:08,682
Why are you standing here?
Give the tea.

230
00:15:19,761 --> 00:15:20,921
Come...

231
00:15:29,271 --> 00:15:30,839
Move that side.

232
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:32,875
What is the occasion,
Kutty Krishna?

233
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:34,943
Your coming itself is a
big occasion.

234
00:15:34,943 --> 00:15:37,045
Like an elephant in a festival.

235
00:15:37,045 --> 00:15:38,714
Has your mental
problem reduced?

236
00:15:38,714 --> 00:15:40,705
It has reduced.
Medicine is getting reduced.

237
00:15:41,783 --> 00:15:44,479
Chinnasamy, Periyasamy!
Bring the luggage.

238
00:15:46,755 --> 00:15:48,052
Father
Child...

239
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:50,251
Where is Mahendran?
At Bangalore.

240
00:15:50,826 --> 00:15:52,427
Mother...

241
00:15:52,427 --> 00:15:53,951
Good day
Good day.

242
00:16:03,572 --> 00:16:06,475
This judge has punished me
for 3 years before.

243
00:16:06,475 --> 00:16:08,777
But after one year was over,
I came on parole & escaped.

244
00:16:08,777 --> 00:16:10,479
Will he recognize me,
when he sees me?

245
00:16:10,479 --> 00:16:14,783
I doubt whether I've done something
to this lady. Will she recognize me?

246
00:16:14,783 --> 00:16:16,307
Let us change the face.

247
00:16:16,952 --> 00:16:19,588
Chinnasamy, Periyasamy!
Bring the luggage.

248
00:16:19,588 --> 00:16:20,489
Did you call?

249
00:16:20,489 --> 00:16:22,184
Take them inside...

250
00:16:27,229 --> 00:16:28,127
Stop.

251
00:16:29,031 --> 00:16:30,065
Who are they?

252
00:16:30,065 --> 00:16:34,102
New servants... Brahmins.
I only appointed them.

253
00:16:34,102 --> 00:16:37,594
Turn this side.
Let sir see your face.

254
00:16:39,141 --> 00:16:41,577
How are they?
Sometimes, they look nice.

255
00:16:41,577 --> 00:16:43,979
Why are you keeping
your face like this?

256
00:16:43,979 --> 00:16:46,248
Because of the weight
it has become like this.

257
00:16:46,248 --> 00:16:48,216
Take them to the room.

258
00:16:51,587 --> 00:16:52,918
Don't burn your hands...

259
00:16:57,459 --> 00:16:59,795
Kutty Krishna!

260
00:16:59,795 --> 00:17:01,496
Coming...
What are you doing there?

261
00:17:01,496 --> 00:17:07,492
I was looking for my box; I've kept
my medicines & tablets in it. A brass box.

262
00:17:09,771 --> 00:17:12,341
That's right.

263
00:17:12,341 --> 00:17:13,775
Promise me,
did you take it?

264
00:17:13,775 --> 00:17:16,078
Why do I need
your box & tablets?

265
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:17,477
That's correct.
Then why did you take?

266
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,251
After 10 years
I'm celebrating "Vishu" here.

267
00:17:22,251 --> 00:17:25,053
Have you arranged everything
for "Viishu Kani" tomorrow?

268
00:17:25,053 --> 00:17:27,055
I must see Krishnan first.

269
00:17:27,055 --> 00:17:29,956
Let everybody come
in the morning. "Kani" is ready.

270
00:17:33,829 --> 00:17:34,989
My God...

271
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:36,991
Konna flower is available.

272
00:17:41,136 --> 00:17:43,839
Where has the Krishnan
statue gone from here?

273
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:46,975
How could I show the "Kani"
tomorrow morning, Krishna...?

274
00:17:46,975 --> 00:17:50,741
I'm going to escape from here
before the judge kills me.

275
00:18:06,662 --> 00:18:07,663
What is this?

276
00:18:07,663 --> 00:18:09,153
This is flute.

277
00:18:10,232 --> 00:18:14,999
Because the statue of Krishnan is
missing from here, I've formed this idea.

278
00:18:16,004 --> 00:18:19,675
Won't you kill me, when you come
to see Kani & if Krishna is not here?

279
00:18:19,675 --> 00:18:23,278
I'm standing with blue paint
since 3 o' clock this morning.

280
00:18:23,278 --> 00:18:24,980
Don't you believe me?

281
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,783
Because of this tension, I've not
eaten anything since yesterday.

282
00:18:27,783 --> 00:18:30,852
Give me butter or milk to eat.

283
00:18:30,852 --> 00:18:32,888
Hand over him
to the police station.

284
00:18:32,888 --> 00:18:36,058
I only know the difficulties
I faced to get the peacock feather.

285
00:18:36,058 --> 00:18:38,788
Let the police come,
I'll tell them everything.

286
00:18:39,428 --> 00:18:41,225
Useless flower... Let it go.

287
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,827
Oh! Police, Murali run...

288
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:58,547
They must have come to arrest me
on the instructions of Menon sir.

289
00:18:58,547 --> 00:19:01,948
Yes, now I understand
everything.

290
00:19:02,351 --> 00:19:03,251
Take me.

291
00:19:03,251 --> 00:19:05,276
What is this?
Take me.

292
00:19:06,088 --> 00:19:08,390
So, they have not come
to arrest me.

293
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:12,894
God! No sandal today, "Kumkum".
That too in vertical line.

294
00:19:12,894 --> 00:19:15,522
Today his madness has increased.

295
00:19:16,765 --> 00:19:19,461
My goodness...

296
00:19:21,103 --> 00:19:22,704
I've come to see
Madhavan brother.

297
00:19:22,704 --> 00:19:23,605
I'll call...

298
00:19:23,605 --> 00:19:25,573
Kutty Krishna
What?

299
00:19:26,174 --> 00:19:28,938
They have come to see Madhavan
Come...

300
00:19:30,846 --> 00:19:33,081
What would you like
to drink tea or coffee?

301
00:19:33,081 --> 00:19:33,882
Coffee for me.

302
00:19:33,882 --> 00:19:35,183
For him?
Tea.

303
00:19:35,183 --> 00:19:36,752
So here coffee & here tea.

304
00:19:36,752 --> 00:19:38,720
Periyasamy?
What?

305
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:43,558
Tell me if you feel difficulty
in climbing the steps.

306
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:44,926
Lock... Police.

307
00:19:44,926 --> 00:19:46,495
My God! Police?

308
00:19:46,495 --> 00:19:47,829
Police has come.

309
00:19:47,829 --> 00:19:49,558
Not there, this side...

310
00:19:50,031 --> 00:19:52,134
Where has that Murali gone?

311
00:19:52,134 --> 00:19:53,465
Madhavan sir...

312
00:19:55,771 --> 00:19:57,472
What made you to come
in this morning?

313
00:19:57,472 --> 00:19:58,006
Here...

314
00:19:58,006 --> 00:19:59,775
A serious matter...

315
00:19:59,775 --> 00:20:00,308
Tell me...

316
00:20:00,308 --> 00:20:01,176
You may go...

317
00:20:01,176 --> 00:20:02,074
Why?
Go...

318
00:20:02,844 --> 00:20:03,645
We shall...

319
00:20:03,645 --> 00:20:04,771
You stay here.

320
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:10,719
Police must have known of our hiding here.
It is better to surrender...

321
00:20:10,719 --> 00:20:12,821
Surrendering is not a brave thing,
let them catch us.

322
00:20:12,821 --> 00:20:14,256
That's what I'm also saying,
you idiot...

323
00:20:14,256 --> 00:20:15,023
Is it?

324
00:20:15,023 --> 00:20:16,091
What is the problem?

325
00:20:16,091 --> 00:20:18,760
Isn't your son Arun studying
in Bangalore medical college?

326
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,227
- Yes.

327
00:20:19,227 --> 00:20:22,864
A student was killed in ragging
in that college two days before.

328
00:20:22,864 --> 00:20:27,096
Karnataka police suspects your son
as one among the accused.

329
00:20:28,503 --> 00:20:31,139
A warrant has been
issued on Arun.

330
00:20:31,139 --> 00:20:34,576
S.P. Antony Punnekkadan is
dealing the case in Kerala.

331
00:20:34,576 --> 00:20:37,312
Antony Punnekkadan?
Then it must be a false case.

332
00:20:37,312 --> 00:20:42,184
Balan brother! He has framed this
case to disgrace our family.

333
00:20:42,184 --> 00:20:43,051
No doubt.

334
00:20:43,051 --> 00:20:46,955
You tell him, not to play with
Justice Viswanathan's family.

335
00:20:46,955 --> 00:20:50,325
If Punnekkadan show his
smartness here, he'll learn...

336
00:20:50,325 --> 00:20:51,451
You may go.

337
00:20:56,731 --> 00:20:57,666
Stop...

338
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:59,968
Drink this & go.

339
00:20:59,968 --> 00:21:01,203
I prepared this
with my own hands.

340
00:21:01,203 --> 00:21:03,467
If not with hands, will you
prepare it with your legs?

341
00:21:04,739 --> 00:21:05,974
This is coffee & this is tea.

342
00:21:05,974 --> 00:21:07,042
I want coffee.

343
00:21:07,042 --> 00:21:08,443
Why don't you drink tea?

344
00:21:08,443 --> 00:21:09,611
I usually take coffee.

345
00:21:09,611 --> 00:21:10,712
Must change that habit.

346
00:21:10,712 --> 00:21:12,814
If you change the cups,
the problem is solved.

347
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:15,283
The problem is not solved;
it is going to start now.

348
00:21:15,283 --> 00:21:16,985
If you are such
a big man, drink.

349
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:18,520
Lick & drink, you son of a dog...

350
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,120
What is this?

351
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,489
He is mad...

352
00:21:20,489 --> 00:21:21,888
Your father only is mad.

353
00:21:22,324 --> 00:21:24,960
Anyway it is your luck, that he didn't
pour the tea on your head.

354
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,551
Start the vehicle.

355
00:21:41,776 --> 00:21:45,247
Mahi! Why didn't you keep your
mobile on? No news after you left.

356
00:21:45,247 --> 00:21:46,581
Father was asking for you.

357
00:21:46,581 --> 00:21:48,283
Call the driver
& bring the luggage.

358
00:21:48,283 --> 00:21:50,385
I've started, I'll come soon...

359
00:21:50,385 --> 00:21:52,020
What? Police matter...

360
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,255
Let father not hear, come here...

361
00:21:53,255 --> 00:21:57,292
To spoil our reputation that
S.P. Punnekkadan did this.

362
00:21:57,292 --> 00:21:59,528
There was a police case on Arun?
Yes.

363
00:21:59,528 --> 00:22:02,053
This is some what
a serious matter, come...

364
00:22:02,898 --> 00:22:04,766
What we heard
about Arun is true.

365
00:22:04,766 --> 00:22:06,268
We had been to Bangalore.

366
00:22:06,268 --> 00:22:08,537
Karnataka police has issued
warrant on Arun...

367
00:22:08,537 --> 00:22:10,539
He is innocent, but the
evidences are against him.

368
00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:14,009
There was a fight between the murdered
& Arun at the college sometime back.

369
00:22:14,009 --> 00:22:15,076
They doubt him
because of that only.

370
00:22:15,076 --> 00:22:16,044
Where is Arun now?

371
00:22:16,044 --> 00:22:18,346
He came with us only. We have
hidden him in the coir factory.

372
00:22:18,346 --> 00:22:19,648
Stephen is on guard.

373
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:22,551
Good! Don't bring him out till
we get the anticipated bail.

374
00:22:22,551 --> 00:22:24,920
That S.P. Punnekkadan
only is dealing the case.

375
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,222
If he is caught by him,
nothing will remain.

376
00:22:27,222 --> 00:22:30,659
That Punnekkadan is waiting to
see the destruction of this family.

377
00:22:30,659 --> 00:22:32,183
For the time being don't
tell father & mother.

378
00:22:33,762 --> 00:22:35,697
What is the matter that
I should not know?

379
00:22:35,697 --> 00:22:37,392
Nothing dad...

380
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,169
Padmini told that you have come.

381
00:22:41,169 --> 00:22:42,261
Didn't Arun come?

382
00:22:42,737 --> 00:22:45,006
He has to stay at Bangalore
for an important matter.

383
00:22:45,006 --> 00:22:47,108
He told me particularly that he would
come & see you in two days.

384
00:22:47,108 --> 00:22:52,705
Are you all setting up
for a drink party?

385
00:22:53,448 --> 00:22:55,177
What is this question?
Come here.

386
00:22:56,318 --> 00:22:57,808
Mother... The vessel weighs.

387
00:22:58,153 --> 00:23:01,156
The police come here frequently
looking for that boy...

388
00:23:01,156 --> 00:23:02,490
We'll have to go inside.

389
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:04,192
So we must leave this place
as early as possible.

390
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:07,429
I've gathered here more...

391
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:08,930
Can't even take one...

392
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:13,001
Children's education, flat loan...
I've 100 such problems.

393
00:23:13,001 --> 00:23:15,537
If I go empty handed,
my husband will...

394
00:23:15,537 --> 00:23:17,772
If we stay here, we'll go with
there handcuffs only.

395
00:23:17,772 --> 00:23:19,407
I've a "Kujagara" idea

396
00:23:19,407 --> 00:23:20,842
"Kujagra" idea?

397
00:23:20,842 --> 00:23:24,713
Not "Kujagra". "Kusagara"
The "Sa" in "Savam".

398
00:23:24,713 --> 00:23:26,114
Whatever it is, I've an idea.

399
00:23:26,114 --> 00:23:28,783
We'll inform the secret,
we know to the police.

400
00:23:28,783 --> 00:23:30,785
Police will catch the boy.

401
00:23:30,785 --> 00:23:35,390
Then, everybody in this house will
be going behind the police.

402
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:38,727
In that gap, we will break the iron
box at the basement room

403
00:23:38,727 --> 00:23:41,062
& take the jewels
of mother & go.

404
00:23:41,062 --> 00:23:41,730
How is my idea?

405
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:45,667
Good! If they arrest us,
when we inform them?

406
00:23:45,667 --> 00:23:49,871
Idiot. There is a No.100 available
for thieves like us to call.

407
00:23:49,871 --> 00:23:54,009
We'll inform the police from here
& stop the police from coming here.

408
00:23:54,009 --> 00:23:55,944
If one spoils, the other also
will get spoiled, right?

409
00:23:55,944 --> 00:23:57,545
I told you to inform
last night itself.

410
00:23:57,545 --> 00:23:58,910
Then, let us dial to 100.

411
00:24:05,353 --> 00:24:07,288
Is that S.P. Antony Punnekkadan?
No.

412
00:24:07,288 --> 00:24:08,657
D.I.G. Krishna Doss?

413
00:24:08,657 --> 00:24:09,624
No.

414
00:24:09,624 --> 00:24:10,825
Both of them are not...

415
00:24:10,825 --> 00:24:11,993
Ask for subordinate officers...

416
00:24:11,993 --> 00:24:12,861
Give it, I'll ask him.

417
00:24:12,861 --> 00:24:14,029
You don't know even this?

418
00:24:14,029 --> 00:24:15,697
D.G.P. is there?

419
00:24:15,697 --> 00:24:17,255
Spoiled everything...

420
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,902
I'm C.I. Jayachandran.

421
00:24:20,902 --> 00:24:21,670
What do you want?

422
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:23,538
Son! Don't get tensed...

423
00:24:23,538 --> 00:24:28,677
Arun Kumar, a killer who is being hunted
by Karnataka police & Kerala police...

424
00:24:28,677 --> 00:24:30,702
Is hiding in the
Ambadi coir factory.

425
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:32,814
Who are you talking?

426
00:24:32,814 --> 00:24:34,783
You won't understand, if I tell you,
but if you see me, you'll know.

427
00:24:34,783 --> 00:24:36,084
Who are you?

428
00:24:36,084 --> 00:24:38,486
I'm the president of our association,
George Brush.

429
00:24:38,486 --> 00:24:39,988
Isn't it George Bush?

430
00:24:39,988 --> 00:24:42,047
It was till yesterday, it has changed
from 6:55 this morning.

431
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:02,143
Why are you here, sir?

432
00:25:02,143 --> 00:25:04,779
We got information that
Arun Kumar who is wanted

433
00:25:04,779 --> 00:25:06,381
...by the police is hiding
in this factory.

434
00:25:06,381 --> 00:25:07,115
Nobody is here.

435
00:25:07,115 --> 00:25:08,514
You may go.

436
00:25:26,801 --> 00:25:28,703
I don't think anything is
going to workout.

437
00:25:28,703 --> 00:25:30,830
It is wise to call Punnekkadan sir.

438
00:25:42,717 --> 00:25:45,120
Police should wear the cap only
after wearing the pant, child...

439
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,587
Mother is ironing the pant.

440
00:25:50,959 --> 00:25:53,061
Alice, is it over?

441
00:25:53,061 --> 00:25:54,562
Here... I'll bring now.

442
00:25:54,562 --> 00:25:56,029
It's time for Tom & Jerry.

443
00:26:01,736 --> 00:26:02,930
Sir! This is Nagulan...

444
00:26:05,106 --> 00:26:07,165
Arun Kumar in coir factory...

445
00:26:09,444 --> 00:26:10,502
Move...

446
00:26:13,948 --> 00:26:16,940
Oh! God. Punnekkadan has
gone without pant.

447
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:44,439
Don't think you are doing
something big by catching me.

448
00:27:44,439 --> 00:27:45,974
With in hours, I'll come out.

449
00:27:45,974 --> 00:27:47,876
After that you won't have
the cap on your head.

450
00:27:47,876 --> 00:27:48,776
You...

451
00:27:48,776 --> 00:27:51,145
My father Thiruvambadi
Madhava Menon...

452
00:27:51,145 --> 00:27:53,773
He is in politics
for the past 30 years.

453
00:27:54,349 --> 00:27:59,988
Not only your father, can't even your
father's father do anything to me.

454
00:27:59,988 --> 00:28:05,085
Let me see how your father who is in
politics for 30 years going disgraces me.

455
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:10,525
Throw him in the jeep.

456
00:28:14,502 --> 00:28:15,366
Sir! Your cap...

457
00:28:23,478 --> 00:28:26,038
Madhava, what is this?

458
00:28:26,247 --> 00:28:28,383
This family's reputation is lost,
isn't it?

459
00:28:28,383 --> 00:28:30,852
Father, we are sure
that he is innocent...

460
00:28:30,852 --> 00:28:32,921
Father! Do you know,
even after the Minister's order,

461
00:28:32,921 --> 00:28:34,622
Antony Punnekkadan refuses
to leave him in bail...

462
00:28:34,622 --> 00:28:37,492
As if he was waiting for a chance to let
you down, he does it deliberately.

463
00:28:37,492 --> 00:28:39,627
Ganeshan & Mahendran
both are in the station,

464
00:28:39,627 --> 00:28:41,527
...there is not even a small
scratch on their bodies...

465
00:28:52,073 --> 00:28:54,041
Police... Lock the cell...

466
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,281
What?

467
00:29:00,281 --> 00:29:02,951
You have started your enquiry
with my son... Sit down...

468
00:29:02,951 --> 00:29:05,720
I have told them not
to touch him...

469
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:09,857
I have called S.P. Antony to come here,
to explain about the arrest...

470
00:29:09,857 --> 00:29:13,294
He won't come, sir. Antony Punnekkadan
won't come to this house...

471
00:29:13,294 --> 00:29:13,995
Why?

472
00:29:13,995 --> 00:29:15,363
It is an old story...

473
00:29:15,363 --> 00:29:18,032
An old story that happened before 10,
18 years, you don't know about it...

474
00:29:18,032 --> 00:29:22,170
This Antony Punnekkadan's father
was a Thasildar... Devasi Kutty...

475
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:25,406
Once he was caught
in a case of taking bribe...

476
00:29:25,406 --> 00:29:29,944
After further investigation,
many cases added to it...

477
00:29:29,944 --> 00:29:31,579
That case came in father's court...

478
00:29:31,579 --> 00:29:34,515
He came to this house saying
that his father was innocent

479
00:29:34,515 --> 00:29:38,252
& this Madhavan was the one
who plotted against his father...

480
00:29:38,252 --> 00:29:40,388
He held father's feet
to save his father...

481
00:29:40,388 --> 00:29:42,590
All the evidences were
against Devasi Kutty.

482
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:44,592
He was imprisoned for 7 years...

483
00:29:44,592 --> 00:29:47,228
We knew that Antony's father
died in the jail only later.

484
00:29:47,228 --> 00:29:48,963
It is that vengeance
he is having on our family.

485
00:29:48,963 --> 00:29:50,098
I don't know about that...

486
00:29:50,098 --> 00:29:54,435
According to the department, this
Antony is honest & a straight forward person.

487
00:29:54,435 --> 00:29:57,271
Let him be Hari Chandran
in your department...

488
00:29:57,271 --> 00:30:00,575
...But as far as we are concerned,
he is a criminal, a criminal in Khaki dress...

489
00:30:00,575 --> 00:30:03,745
D.I. Sir has come,
bring something to drink...

490
00:30:03,745 --> 00:30:04,846
Whisky or brandy?

491
00:30:04,846 --> 00:30:07,949
You usually give it to the policeman,
that's why I asked...

492
00:30:07,949 --> 00:30:10,747
Come here, he has
become a nuisance.

493
00:30:12,387 --> 00:30:15,117
They also have come, must
ask what they want to drink.

494
00:30:17,825 --> 00:30:20,061
What would you like
to drink?

495
00:30:20,061 --> 00:30:22,296
Tea or coffee?

496
00:30:22,296 --> 00:30:23,965
We don't want anything...

497
00:30:23,965 --> 00:30:26,567
I know, you are angry
with me...

498
00:30:26,567 --> 00:30:29,037
I have behaved so cheaply, that day.

499
00:30:29,037 --> 00:30:32,473
Don't you know, if
I don't take the tablet...

500
00:30:32,473 --> 00:30:33,641
Sometimes I'll forget...

501
00:30:33,641 --> 00:30:35,543
I hold your feet
& ask for forgiveness...

502
00:30:35,543 --> 00:30:36,244
Don't do it...

503
00:30:36,244 --> 00:30:38,713
Then, shall I bring some tea?

504
00:30:38,713 --> 00:30:39,407
Bring it...

505
00:30:40,882 --> 00:30:41,405
Poor man...

506
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:45,551
What, won't you drink coffee?

507
00:30:48,756 --> 00:30:52,894
Chinnasamy, Periasamy, Sornamma...

508
00:30:52,894 --> 00:30:56,664
When the policemen come to this
house, no servant will be available.

509
00:30:56,664 --> 00:30:58,166
Everybody, are thieves?

510
00:30:58,166 --> 00:31:01,102
If they are thieves they must have
good relationship with the thieves.

511
00:31:01,102 --> 00:31:03,905
If we run seeing the police,
won't the people in the house suspect us?

512
00:31:03,905 --> 00:31:05,706
What suspicion?

513
00:31:05,706 --> 00:31:07,742
They'll think that we are doing
some work by walking & running...

514
00:31:07,742 --> 00:31:11,546
You only said that if we inform the police
the whole family will go after them.

515
00:31:11,546 --> 00:31:13,881
God, we expected one thing but
something different is happening...

516
00:31:13,881 --> 00:31:15,650
We have seen only the ordinary
policemen before

517
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:17,585
...but now the entire
police are in the house.

518
00:31:17,585 --> 00:31:20,121
As this Kutty Krishnan is stupid
& absent minded we have been lucky.

519
00:31:20,121 --> 00:31:21,689
Otherwise we would have been
caught earlier.

520
00:31:21,689 --> 00:31:22,723
Yes.

521
00:31:22,723 --> 00:31:24,292
Must stay here
at least for 3, 4 days.

522
00:31:24,292 --> 00:31:27,929
Akrikaran Uppayi has told that
he would come with the vehicle tonight.

523
00:31:27,929 --> 00:31:31,699
We'll take all the vessels
& everything tonight...

524
00:31:31,699 --> 00:31:33,599
Tomorrow night, big vessels...

525
00:31:34,769 --> 00:31:37,738
Night... big vessels... tell us...

526
00:31:37,738 --> 00:31:39,865
The vessel has broken.

527
00:31:42,176 --> 00:31:43,837
Hey! Thief...

528
00:31:49,617 --> 00:31:51,608
Don't hold me...
I'll give a case against you...

529
00:31:58,092 --> 00:31:59,160
Can you see it, sir?

530
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,062
He is torturing
the poor servants.

531
00:32:01,062 --> 00:32:04,632
I think his madness has increased
today. I shall go & beat him...

532
00:32:04,632 --> 00:32:05,967
Don't you have any job,
come let's go...

533
00:32:05,967 --> 00:32:11,205
Run...

534
00:32:11,205 --> 00:32:12,763
He'll beat...

535
00:32:22,116 --> 00:32:24,886
Move a little sir,
everyone is thief here...

536
00:32:24,886 --> 00:32:26,454
Sir, I want to tell you
a matter...

537
00:32:26,454 --> 00:32:27,188
Here, in the kitchen...

538
00:32:27,188 --> 00:32:28,055
Go inside...

539
00:32:28,055 --> 00:32:30,725
I am telling you to hear this only
not to send me inside.

540
00:32:30,725 --> 00:32:32,627
You come with me...

541
00:32:32,627 --> 00:32:33,161
Listen to me...

542
00:32:33,161 --> 00:32:33,494
Take him...

543
00:32:33,494 --> 00:32:35,563
Not only one, everybody here...

544
00:32:35,563 --> 00:32:38,123
I want to tell a truth
before the judge...

545
00:32:52,713 --> 00:32:54,615
Sir, why did you call me here?

546
00:32:54,615 --> 00:32:55,082
That...

547
00:32:55,082 --> 00:32:55,950
I'll tell you...

548
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:59,787
You have to explain why you
refused bail for an innocent boy,

549
00:32:59,787 --> 00:33:01,812
...belonging to a family who
grant bail for all the accused.

550
00:33:02,823 --> 00:33:05,226
When you come to know that
my son is not involved in the case...

551
00:33:05,226 --> 00:33:07,922
Can you give back the reputation
of this family which is lost?

552
00:33:08,963 --> 00:33:09,861
Tell me...

553
00:33:11,332 --> 00:33:14,235
Before arresting a person
from such a reputed family,

554
00:33:14,235 --> 00:33:17,038
you should have consulted me,
as a D.I.G...

555
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:22,710
Did you call me here to answer the
stupid questions of this reputed family?

556
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:24,879
No, to know the details
of the case...

557
00:33:24,879 --> 00:33:26,747
I've sent the details of the case
to the office already...

558
00:33:26,747 --> 00:33:28,783
It's not to the department;
I want to know it...

559
00:33:28,783 --> 00:33:34,255
I didn't get the order from
my superiors to give explanation

560
00:33:34,255 --> 00:33:37,622
...by going to the house
of the arrested person...

561
00:33:40,061 --> 00:33:43,965
He was the honorable Supreme
Court justice, who was in power...

562
00:33:43,965 --> 00:33:46,729
You must give him an explanation...

563
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:56,444
For getting involved in the murder of
the Bangalore Medical college student,

564
00:33:56,444 --> 00:33:59,013
...that was the first warrant
issued in your younger son's

565
00:33:59,013 --> 00:34:00,948
...name Arun by the
Karnataka Government...

566
00:34:00,948 --> 00:34:04,952
The parts of the killed person's
body were found at 3 places...

567
00:34:04,952 --> 00:34:06,821
Head at Bangalore,
body at Coimbatore &

568
00:34:06,821 --> 00:34:09,590
...hands & legs here down
the Thoppumbadi bridge...

569
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:12,193
By the request of the
Karnataka Government,

570
00:34:12,193 --> 00:34:15,062
D.G.P. Krishnamurthy handed
over this case to me...

571
00:34:15,062 --> 00:34:16,222
Warrant details...

572
00:34:19,267 --> 00:34:21,599
There is one more information,
added to it...

573
00:34:21,936 --> 00:34:25,106
We got the information that
Arun was hiding in your factory

574
00:34:25,106 --> 00:34:27,734
...from your residence
landline number...

575
00:34:31,812 --> 00:34:33,581
The thief is inside the ship...

576
00:34:33,581 --> 00:34:36,117
The thief is not inside the ship,
he is inside the house...

577
00:34:36,117 --> 00:34:37,785
Are you allowing me to tell, no...

578
00:34:37,785 --> 00:34:38,986
I won't tell you...

579
00:34:38,986 --> 00:34:39,975
You go that side...

580
00:34:40,655 --> 00:34:44,458
This is the copy of the F.I.R. that I am
going to submit tomorrow in the court...

581
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:46,460
If we get the Government file earlier...

582
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,296
...& if there is any loop in the F.I.R...

583
00:34:48,296 --> 00:34:50,965
...It'll be easy for you to
find a way to get the bail...

584
00:34:50,965 --> 00:34:54,833
If it is the reason
for calling me here...

585
00:34:56,437 --> 00:35:01,676
To rescue my grand son, who was
arrested based only on suspicion...

586
00:35:01,676 --> 00:35:04,045
...I don't need the Government file...

587
00:35:04,045 --> 00:35:06,580
I know to appoint a good lawyer.

588
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:08,716
According to police act 48- C...

589
00:35:08,716 --> 00:35:11,385
...I'll produce the accused in
the transfer court tomorrow...

590
00:35:11,385 --> 00:35:14,322
Bail is not as easy as you think...

591
00:35:14,322 --> 00:35:19,593
Dr. Viinoth Baskar, who saw the
murder directly, is the witness no.1.

592
00:35:19,593 --> 00:35:22,463
Valakkaran Khadhar is the
witness no.2,

593
00:35:22,463 --> 00:35:27,568
...who saw the part of the body transported
in a car & thrown from the bridge...

594
00:35:27,568 --> 00:35:31,205
What more evidence is required
for the court to handover?

595
00:35:31,205 --> 00:35:34,075
...the case to Karnataka police
for further investigation?

596
00:35:34,075 --> 00:35:37,378
Do you know to whom
you are teaching the law?

597
00:35:37,378 --> 00:35:40,414
Don't... Let his faith save him...

598
00:35:40,414 --> 00:35:42,616
Even then, I have to tell
you something...

599
00:35:42,616 --> 00:35:46,987
To settle your old account, don't
spoil the reputation of your uniform...

600
00:35:46,987 --> 00:35:50,191
What is the account pending
between us to be settled?

601
00:35:50,191 --> 00:35:55,930
If you open the account book of
my father who was your neighbor,

602
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:56,954
you are wrong...

603
00:35:58,466 --> 00:36:01,969
When I fell down on your feet
for the justice for my father...

604
00:36:01,969 --> 00:36:06,540
...the words you spoke are still ringing
in my ears as God's words...

605
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,909
There is no discrimination
before the law...

606
00:36:08,909 --> 00:36:10,511
There can't be any relationship...

607
00:36:10,511 --> 00:36:13,447
The evidence & the witnesses
are only important...

608
00:36:13,447 --> 00:36:16,751
If I had money & power
at that time,

609
00:36:16,751 --> 00:36:19,720
I would have brought the evidences
& witnesses before you...

610
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,989
If it had happened,

611
00:36:21,989 --> 00:36:25,447
it wouldn't have been my father
who was punished but this Madhavan.

612
00:36:30,364 --> 00:36:38,203
My father who suffered & died in jail won't
come before you to settle his accounts...

613
00:36:39,573 --> 00:36:41,942
I hope that your justice heart,
which you showed towards my father...

614
00:36:41,942 --> 00:36:45,613
has not changed because
of the blood relationship...

615
00:36:45,613 --> 00:36:49,650
We would have to face
many difficulties in the life

616
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:52,753
when we try to hold our principles.

617
00:36:52,753 --> 00:36:55,347
Like that, you'll see this also...

618
00:37:04,398 --> 00:37:05,592
Come with me...

619
00:37:09,236 --> 00:37:15,075
I am not that old poor boy who was
following your back calling brother & sir...

620
00:37:15,075 --> 00:37:22,607
If you call an I.P.S. officer like me without
respect, I'll throw you in the cell.

621
00:37:23,551 --> 00:37:25,178
Tell your brother Balan also...

622
00:37:29,723 --> 00:37:33,761
When the matter has become very serious,
do you want me to do anything?

623
00:37:33,761 --> 00:37:37,064
I am asking the help that could be
done only in the path of justice...

624
00:37:37,064 --> 00:37:38,732
Sir, for you... I...

625
00:37:38,732 --> 00:37:40,290
Thank you for coming on my call.

626
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:43,671
Father...

627
00:37:43,671 --> 00:37:47,541
You should bring Arun in
bail by using any influence...

628
00:37:47,541 --> 00:37:52,746
My grandson need not come out in bail
using Justice Vishwanathan influence...

629
00:37:52,746 --> 00:37:53,214
Father...

630
00:37:53,214 --> 00:37:55,273
It's enough to appoint
an advocate...

631
00:37:57,751 --> 00:37:57,785
Advocate John Mathew,
a famous criminal lawyer...

632
00:37:57,785 --> 00:38:00,488
Advocate John Mathew,
a famous criminal lawyer...

633
00:38:00,488 --> 00:38:02,156
I know about him,
very talented...

634
00:38:02,156 --> 00:38:04,692
If you have that much faith,
we shall fix him for this case...

635
00:38:04,692 --> 00:38:06,093
Balan brother,
what do you say?

636
00:38:06,093 --> 00:38:07,628
You bring him here...

637
00:38:07,628 --> 00:38:08,729
Don't...

638
00:38:08,729 --> 00:38:13,291
In this critical situation, a test is
not necessary for fixing an advocate.

639
00:38:15,035 --> 00:38:17,238
Then father,
whom do you suggest?

640
00:38:17,238 --> 00:38:20,002
I have already talked with
advocate Ramesh Nambiyar...

641
00:38:24,845 --> 00:38:27,348
It must be her recommendation...

642
00:38:27,348 --> 00:38:30,283
No, it's my decision.

643
00:38:32,119 --> 00:38:33,521
He is in Bangalore now...

644
00:38:33,521 --> 00:38:36,724
A small accident to his sister.

645
00:38:36,724 --> 00:38:38,559
He'll leave tonight...

646
00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:40,427
There is no flight from
Bangalore in the night...

647
00:38:40,427 --> 00:38:41,428
...Only tomorrow afternoon...

648
00:38:41,428 --> 00:38:42,793
He is coming by car...

649
00:39:07,955 --> 00:39:10,724
Ramesh Nambiyar or even
his clerk is not in the court.

650
00:39:10,724 --> 00:39:13,160
Nothing is going to happen
even if he doesn't come.

651
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,429
We have arranged everything
with the help of John Mathew...

652
00:39:15,429 --> 00:39:16,196
Madhavan brother...

653
00:39:16,196 --> 00:39:17,831
Will that Papachan come?

654
00:39:17,831 --> 00:39:19,967
When Karingal Papachan says
that he will come, he'll come.

655
00:39:19,967 --> 00:39:22,595
He'll kidnap the person who will
give witness against us...

656
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:31,070
Papachan...

657
00:39:35,215 --> 00:39:38,519
Viinoth Baskar, a doctor...
a tall person with gentleman looks...

658
00:39:38,519 --> 00:39:40,680
Blue jeans & red T-shirt...

659
00:39:58,238 --> 00:40:01,639
A person named Viinoth Baskar
from Bangalore is looking for you...

660
00:40:01,775 --> 00:40:02,776
Dr. Vinoth Baskar?

661
00:40:02,776 --> 00:40:03,834
Where is he now?

662
00:40:11,952 --> 00:40:14,955
Antony Punnekkadan, S.P.

663
00:40:14,955 --> 00:40:16,354
This...

664
00:40:18,325 --> 00:40:20,127
Why are you here?

665
00:40:20,127 --> 00:40:21,095
Nothing...

666
00:40:21,095 --> 00:40:22,630
Then why are you roaming here?

667
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:25,599
The hearing of the fight case
at the shanty is today.

668
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:27,931
Go...

669
00:40:29,236 --> 00:40:32,706
Before the court begins,
the prosecutor wants to see you...

670
00:40:32,706 --> 00:40:34,341
I saw him;
he gave all the details...

671
00:40:34,341 --> 00:40:38,545
Do you know anything about
the associates of Arun Kumar?

672
00:40:38,545 --> 00:40:41,048
I can identify if I see them,
but I don't know anything more.

673
00:40:41,048 --> 00:40:43,050
The 1 st hearing is ours.

674
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:43,812
Come quickly.

675
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:38,439
Sir, you are standing here...

676
00:41:38,439 --> 00:41:39,807
Punnekkadan sir wants
to see you...

677
00:41:39,807 --> 00:41:40,941
He has got high B.P...

678
00:41:40,941 --> 00:41:43,310
What, what's wrong?

679
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:45,345
Sir, he has fainted in the bathroom
due to the raise in his B.P...

680
00:41:45,345 --> 00:41:46,980
Take him to the hospital
without delaying...

681
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:49,683
He must have not eaten
anything in the morning...

682
00:41:49,683 --> 00:41:51,618
Don't know from where
he is getting food...

683
00:41:51,618 --> 00:41:55,189
You must save him
at any cost...

684
00:41:55,189 --> 00:41:57,057
If anything happens to him...

685
00:41:57,057 --> 00:41:58,092
Shall I go with him?

686
00:41:58,092 --> 00:41:59,660
If S.P. Punnekkadan ask for you?

687
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:01,395
That's right... take him...

688
00:42:01,395 --> 00:42:02,589
Take him quickly...

689
00:42:04,898 --> 00:42:07,568
Viinoth Baskar's statement

690
00:42:07,568 --> 00:42:11,238
& the statement given in the F.I.R.
by the Karnataka Government...

691
00:42:11,238 --> 00:42:13,741
...then the witness
of Valakkaran Khadhar...

692
00:42:13,741 --> 00:42:16,744
...it is not so easy to get bail
in this circumstance...

693
00:42:16,744 --> 00:42:20,080
But who could convert a goat
as a dog & a dog as a tiger...

694
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:24,184
...the talented advocate Ramesh Nambiyar is
going to defend, we shouldn't forget it...

695
00:42:24,184 --> 00:42:27,187
We had already met
in the court before...

696
00:42:27,187 --> 00:42:30,491
In those days police department
was not as strong as it is now...

697
00:42:30,491 --> 00:42:33,927
Sir, you need not fear
about that Ramesh Nambiyar...

698
00:42:33,927 --> 00:42:36,794
He won't appear in the court
for the accused...

699
00:42:38,132 --> 00:42:41,363
He left Bangalore
at 2 O'clock in the night.

700
00:42:42,836 --> 00:42:47,307
He can't expect to drive fast on the roads
of Kerala as on the roads of Bangalore...

701
00:42:47,307 --> 00:42:49,943
Even if he tries
to increase the speed...

702
00:42:49,943 --> 00:42:52,212
...the speed of the car would
be more than 100 kms...

703
00:42:52,212 --> 00:42:54,681
High way speed limit is 70 kms...

704
00:42:54,681 --> 00:42:57,951
According to section
279, 337, 338...

705
00:42:57,951 --> 00:43:03,323
a vehicle crossing 70 km will be
considered as rash & negligent driving...

706
00:43:03,323 --> 00:43:06,727
...& can be taken under custody & police
has got the rights to arrest the driver...

707
00:43:06,727 --> 00:43:08,929
My friend Jacob,

708
00:43:08,929 --> 00:43:15,767
a traffic control A.S.P. is standing on
the high way to stop Ramesh Nambiyar...

709
00:43:21,208 --> 00:43:24,912
An interceptor vehicle with
all ultra modern facilities...

710
00:43:24,912 --> 00:43:30,551
...It can find the vehicle & its speed
coming away from 1.5 km...

711
00:43:30,551 --> 00:43:31,882
It records it also...

712
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:04,818
The advocate's car crossed avoiding
the police barricade & the traffic rules...

713
00:44:04,818 --> 00:44:06,183
Speed?

714
00:44:09,056 --> 00:44:11,616
It's recorded 140 Kms...

715
00:44:27,808 --> 00:44:28,638
Get down...

716
00:44:38,385 --> 00:44:40,353
What is the problem for
having a battalion of police?

717
00:44:47,361 --> 00:44:49,062
What can I do for that?

718
00:44:49,062 --> 00:44:50,664
No need for your
argument advocate...

719
00:44:50,664 --> 00:44:54,828
This vehicle's speed & visual are
recorded in the police interceptor...

720
00:44:57,504 --> 00:44:59,606
Whatever it is over
speed is a crime...

721
00:44:59,606 --> 00:45:00,908
But you can't arrest me...

722
00:45:00,908 --> 00:45:02,609
...Because it's not me
who drove the car...

723
00:45:02,609 --> 00:45:07,214
You got down the car from the driving
seat in front of all the policemen

724
00:45:07,214 --> 00:45:08,382
& saying you didn't drive the car...

725
00:45:08,382 --> 00:45:13,319
You have to accept my explanation,
because this is a left hand driver...

726
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:21,461
All the credit goes to Viikram Bai,

727
00:45:21,461 --> 00:45:24,055
who drove the car with such speed
& brought me here in time.

728
00:45:34,408 --> 00:45:35,500
Himalayan rally member.

729
00:45:37,644 --> 00:45:40,078
Bai, go with him...

730
00:45:44,084 --> 00:45:45,210
The court begins at 11 O'clock...

731
00:45:48,755 --> 00:45:50,590
Move that side...
Sir has come.

732
00:45:50,590 --> 00:45:52,459
I didn't expect that
you would come...

733
00:45:52,459 --> 00:45:54,194
Sir, you have saved my life...

734
00:45:54,194 --> 00:45:55,062
What is the matter?

735
00:45:55,062 --> 00:45:58,332
No... lf the advocate doesn't
appear in court in time...

736
00:45:58,332 --> 00:45:59,866
...or if the advocate
loses the case...

737
00:45:59,866 --> 00:46:01,635
...or if he changes side...

738
00:46:01,635 --> 00:46:05,172
...it is I, the clerk
who will get the beating...

739
00:46:05,172 --> 00:46:07,307
When you were delayed
to come from Bangalore...

740
00:46:07,307 --> 00:46:10,477
...& that nuisance
Thiruvambadi's starring at me...

741
00:46:10,477 --> 00:46:14,481
I was sure that my
whole family had gone...

742
00:46:14,481 --> 00:46:17,150
Sir, now you may carry on
with your argument in the court...

743
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:19,414
I am at your back... Go...

744
00:46:20,253 --> 00:46:22,187
There... sir has come...

745
00:46:24,391 --> 00:46:25,359
Sir, details of the case...

746
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:27,294
I already got the
details over phone...

747
00:46:27,294 --> 00:46:29,229
Madhavan, I have come,
you need not worry...

748
00:46:29,229 --> 00:46:31,298
As we couldn't give
you the full details,

749
00:46:31,298 --> 00:46:33,967
we have kidnapped the witness
Dr. Viinoth Baskar, who came from Bangalore...

750
00:46:33,967 --> 00:46:35,702
Why have you
behaved foolishly like this?

751
00:46:35,702 --> 00:46:37,771
You did it to win the case,
didn't you?

752
00:46:37,771 --> 00:46:41,867
You will be the loser if the witness
doesn't appear for the case...

753
00:46:43,143 --> 00:46:47,414
Because of this, your son's bail enquiry will
also be adjourned along with the case...

754
00:46:47,414 --> 00:46:49,383
Ramesh...

755
00:46:49,383 --> 00:46:51,385
Did you hear what sir said?

756
00:46:51,385 --> 00:46:54,021
If you lose,
you shouldn't blame me...

757
00:46:54,021 --> 00:46:54,521
I'll beat you...

758
00:46:54,521 --> 00:46:56,682
I don't have the time or
I'll stand to get the beating...

759
00:47:18,845 --> 00:47:22,349
This is the copy of the
requisition letter given

760
00:47:22,349 --> 00:47:24,684
by the Karnataka police
to the Kerala D.G.P. K. K. Murthy...

761
00:47:24,684 --> 00:47:25,685
It says...

762
00:47:25,685 --> 00:47:29,089
...According to the statement of
the main witness Dr. Viinoth Baskar...

763
00:47:29,089 --> 00:47:34,828
...The suspect Arun Kumar should be
handed over to the Karnataka police...

764
00:47:34,828 --> 00:47:38,198
The suspect...

765
00:47:38,198 --> 00:47:42,536
It is not possible to handover him to
the Karnataka police based on suspicion...

766
00:47:42,536 --> 00:47:46,206
...Because there is possibility of
my innocent client to be enquired

767
00:47:46,206 --> 00:47:49,107
...harshly physically & mentally
at the other state...

768
00:47:53,814 --> 00:47:59,548
Dr. Vinoth Baskar is an imaginary witness
created by the Karnataka police...

769
00:48:02,355 --> 00:48:05,654
I met him in the court just
before the court started.

770
00:48:10,764 --> 00:48:13,665
This Arun Kumar is
the main accused...

771
00:48:15,502 --> 00:48:20,040
The witness Valakkaran Khadhar
who saw the accused throwing...

772
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:22,843
the murdered medical college
student's hands & legs...

773
00:48:22,843 --> 00:48:25,679
...from the Thoppumbadi
bridge has come here.

774
00:48:25,679 --> 00:48:27,613
It was he who
informed the police...

775
00:48:42,129 --> 00:48:42,829
Khadhar...

776
00:48:42,829 --> 00:48:43,396
Yes...

777
00:48:43,396 --> 00:48:45,732
At what time was it,
when you saw the incident?

778
00:48:45,732 --> 00:48:49,736
It was 3 O' clock early in the morning;
there was a heavy storm & rain.

779
00:48:49,736 --> 00:48:53,604
I saw the boy clearly who is standing here,
throwing a box from the bridge...

780
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:02,215
I took the box to the shore...

781
00:49:02,215 --> 00:49:04,240
When I opened the box,
I saw 2 hands & legs...

782
00:49:08,355 --> 00:49:10,687
Khadhar don't go...
I have to question you...

783
00:49:14,161 --> 00:49:17,931
How could you see his face
so clearly at that night time?

784
00:49:17,931 --> 00:49:21,535
It's not possible to see the face
in the speed light coming from behind...

785
00:49:21,535 --> 00:49:25,839
Since it was a no moon day, it couldn't
be possible to see in the moon light also.

786
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:29,042
The distance is 75 mts from
your place to the bridge...

787
00:49:29,042 --> 00:49:34,781
When you have a supernatural vision power,
why are you wearing this power glass?

788
00:49:34,781 --> 00:49:35,615
How did you see it?

789
00:49:35,615 --> 00:49:38,885
That... I... saw him in
the light of the lightening.

790
00:49:38,885 --> 00:49:40,921
How many persons were with him,
when you saw him?

791
00:49:40,921 --> 00:49:43,490
One or two persons were with him,
but I don't remember their faces...

792
00:49:43,490 --> 00:49:45,583
Why? Didn't lightening
show light on their faces?

793
00:49:53,133 --> 00:49:56,636
You were sailing on a boat
even in that heavy rain & storm.

794
00:49:56,636 --> 00:49:59,306
Were you using raincoat,
umbrella or a cap?

795
00:49:59,306 --> 00:50:03,176
I didn't expect that much rain,
I became wet in the rain...

796
00:50:03,176 --> 00:50:05,412
What is the power
of your glass?

797
00:50:05,412 --> 00:50:06,446
I don't know that.

798
00:50:06,446 --> 00:50:08,880
The people of my village said,
if I wear this I could see well...

799
00:50:12,185 --> 00:50:13,987
Now tell me...

800
00:50:13,987 --> 00:50:17,290
Where is the accused that was
standing on the bridge that day?

801
00:50:17,290 --> 00:50:21,094
Without my specks, I am not
able to see anything...

802
00:50:21,094 --> 00:50:24,197
Khadhar was wearing his glasses,
when he saw the incident...

803
00:50:24,197 --> 00:50:26,700
If he had worn this glass...

804
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:31,004
...in that heavy rain & storm,
not even wearing a cap,

805
00:50:31,004 --> 00:50:33,871
Khadhar's glasses
would have become wet.

806
00:50:39,546 --> 00:50:42,182
Have you fixed a wiper
in your glasses?

807
00:50:42,182 --> 00:50:44,451
Don't wipe it, wear it...

808
00:50:44,451 --> 00:50:48,251
Tell me now, among those who
are standing who are the accused?

809
00:50:59,733 --> 00:51:01,301
There he is...

810
00:51:01,301 --> 00:51:03,826
Do you think that,
I can't see you if you hide?

811
00:51:06,673 --> 00:51:07,741
Khadhar, you may go...

812
00:51:07,741 --> 00:51:08,969
Am I not correct?

813
00:51:10,510 --> 00:51:16,149
It is not believable for a person
who has not seen the accused

814
00:51:16,149 --> 00:51:19,319
before but has seen
in a flash of lightening

815
00:51:19,319 --> 00:51:23,456
with the wet glasses from
the distance of 75 mts.

816
00:51:23,456 --> 00:51:31,227
This Khadhar is a false witness created
by S.P. Antony for his stubbornness.

817
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:41,966
I request you sir to release the grandson
of the honorable Justice from this case...

818
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:50,617
We all know that he is innocent...

819
00:51:50,617 --> 00:51:56,089
But for the court the brilliant argument
from an advocate like you is important.

820
00:51:56,089 --> 00:52:00,860
For you this may the case one
among many cases you had won...

821
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:02,762
But if you ask me...

822
00:52:02,762 --> 00:52:06,099
...You have saved
the reputation of this family...

823
00:52:06,099 --> 00:52:07,031
...It's respect.

824
00:52:12,405 --> 00:52:14,908
What is this, you have
brought a sweet stall?

825
00:52:14,908 --> 00:52:18,345
Nobody has forgotten
your love...

826
00:52:18,345 --> 00:52:21,246
Some persons never
forget the past...

827
00:52:29,155 --> 00:52:29,883
No...

828
00:52:34,828 --> 00:52:41,131
The person whom you loved cannot
be forgotten so easily, right?

829
00:52:50,009 --> 00:52:52,273
Where are you looking & walking?

830
00:52:58,051 --> 00:53:01,521
Father told that your sister had met
with an accident, how is she now?

831
00:53:01,521 --> 00:53:05,158
She is physically alright, but
mentally she has not recovered yet.

832
00:53:05,158 --> 00:53:07,293
I have seen her,
when she was a child...

833
00:53:07,293 --> 00:53:09,229
She is studying there...

834
00:53:09,229 --> 00:53:10,696
Sir, then I...

835
00:53:14,434 --> 00:53:17,604
Release the witness without any harm,
kidnapped by Madhavan brother.

836
00:53:17,604 --> 00:53:19,739
Our enemies brought him
by paying money to him.

837
00:53:19,739 --> 00:53:21,207
We shall release him
after a few days.

838
00:53:21,207 --> 00:53:23,767
If he gives us work
as soon as he is released?

839
00:53:26,312 --> 00:53:27,438
One minute...

840
00:53:29,249 --> 00:53:33,420
I think you must be disturbed
by my behavior inside...

841
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:37,290
You are in her heart
as a dream person...

842
00:53:37,290 --> 00:53:40,660
Whenever I take drinks, I used give
her a slap saying your name.

843
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:42,796
Or I won't able to sleep...

844
00:53:42,796 --> 00:53:46,366
It has become a habit.
She won't tell outside...

845
00:53:46,366 --> 00:53:51,638
If I don't tell you this now, you will
think that I am a useless husband.

846
00:53:51,638 --> 00:53:54,707
Because you have not tasted
the beating you are talking like this.

847
00:53:54,707 --> 00:53:57,977
A man with his self confidence
& conscience...

848
00:53:57,977 --> 00:54:01,581
...won't insult, harm or
scare women at any time...

849
00:54:01,581 --> 00:54:05,585
It mustn't be shown by beating,
by showing the affection...

850
00:54:05,585 --> 00:54:10,290
Doesn't matter, it's
because of your ignorance...

851
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:11,524
Can't you understand...?

852
00:54:11,524 --> 00:54:13,326
If you want to understand?

853
00:54:13,326 --> 00:54:16,729
You, your father & your grandfather
should have been born to a good father.

854
00:54:16,729 --> 00:54:19,632
Never mind, try it
in your next incarnation...

855
00:54:19,632 --> 00:54:20,500
What's going on here...?

856
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:22,263
I was teaching him
a law point...

857
00:54:26,539 --> 00:54:29,776
I committed mistake
in Padmini's matter...

858
00:54:29,776 --> 00:54:31,077
It is an incurable sorrow.

859
00:54:31,077 --> 00:54:34,113
I was not aware that
she loved you...

860
00:54:34,113 --> 00:54:35,849
I was also not
aware of it sir...

861
00:54:35,849 --> 00:54:37,784
If I knew it before, I would
have made it clear to her...

862
00:54:37,784 --> 00:54:39,819
She is like a sister to me...

863
00:54:39,819 --> 00:54:40,786
Nambiyar sir...

864
00:54:42,055 --> 00:54:44,190
I knew you have come...

865
00:54:44,190 --> 00:54:45,325
I was a little busy...

866
00:54:45,325 --> 00:54:48,895
Since there are no servants in
the kitchen, I had to do everything...

867
00:54:48,895 --> 00:54:51,431
What do you like to have,
coffee or tea?

868
00:54:51,431 --> 00:54:51,865
I don't want anything...

869
00:54:51,865 --> 00:54:54,100
You should not say like that,
you must have something...

870
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:54,968
I don't want anything...

871
00:54:54,968 --> 00:54:56,102
Why you don't
want anything...

872
00:54:56,102 --> 00:54:57,036
You go...

873
00:54:57,036 --> 00:54:58,404
Come...

874
00:54:58,404 --> 00:54:59,539
Why?
Come...

875
00:54:59,539 --> 00:55:01,439
He is a little confused...

876
00:55:07,847 --> 00:55:08,836
Arun...

877
00:55:09,349 --> 00:55:10,350
Where are you going?

878
00:55:10,350 --> 00:55:11,217
I am going to a place nearby.

879
00:55:11,217 --> 00:55:13,953
Don't... Stop all your entertainments
for some time...

880
00:55:13,953 --> 00:55:16,820
See this, a courier has come saying
that somebody is going to kill you...

881
00:55:18,424 --> 00:55:22,362
Balan brother, why are you afraid
of this anonymous letter?

882
00:55:22,362 --> 00:55:24,193
You need not worry...
you may go...

883
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:31,104
What Balan brother, he can have
all these enjoyments only at this age...

884
00:55:31,104 --> 00:55:32,739
Let him enjoy...

885
00:55:32,739 --> 00:55:33,330
Let him enjoy...

886
01:00:31,737 --> 01:00:33,295
Don't. I will take.

887
01:01:28,961 --> 01:01:29,729
When did it happen?

888
01:01:29,729 --> 01:01:31,530
The incident occurred
at 12:30 A.M.

889
01:01:31,530 --> 01:01:34,897
The S.P. Punnekkadan, who was there,
arrested the accused.

890
01:01:35,201 --> 01:01:37,637
S.P. is enquiring the accused.

891
01:01:37,637 --> 01:01:38,971
He doesn't speak anything.

892
01:01:38,971 --> 01:01:40,606
On receiving
the postmortem report...

893
01:01:40,606 --> 01:01:42,233
the accused will be presented
before the magistrate.

894
01:01:54,520 --> 01:02:00,857
We had rescued him from the case,
but we couldn't save his life.

895
01:02:05,998 --> 01:02:07,431
Open...

896
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:17,599
Come here...

897
01:02:18,511 --> 01:02:21,480
An auto rickshaw man
came 4, 5 times to see you.

898
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:22,081
What is the matter?

899
01:02:22,081 --> 01:02:24,050
He said that it has
to be said in person.

900
01:02:24,050 --> 01:02:25,779
A woman & her
daughter were in the auto.

901
01:02:26,385 --> 01:02:27,520
Won't you eat?

902
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:28,350
- No.

903
01:02:29,655 --> 01:02:31,714
Nani... Take everything away.

904
01:02:32,892 --> 01:02:34,917
I'll show you who I am.
You idiot...

905
01:02:35,328 --> 01:02:36,929
I took only one appam
Why are you sleeping?

906
01:02:36,929 --> 01:02:38,364
What is your problem?

907
01:02:38,364 --> 01:02:40,967
Somebody is standing outside
the gate & trying to line me up.

908
01:02:40,967 --> 01:02:42,491
You?

909
01:02:43,202 --> 01:02:46,539
I sweep... He lines me...

910
01:02:46,539 --> 01:02:48,708
Go & see, who that punk... is.

911
01:02:48,708 --> 01:02:50,232
Who is that idiot?

912
01:02:50,543 --> 01:02:51,610
I'll show him now.

913
01:02:51,610 --> 01:02:57,717
Who is lining the old woman, who is
sitting in the ditch & dreaming?

914
01:02:57,717 --> 01:02:59,819
Who are you from inside?
Open the gate...

915
01:02:59,819 --> 01:03:02,755
Aren't you the auto rickshaw man,
who came yesterday?

916
01:03:02,755 --> 01:03:05,424
Oh! It's you. I'll go only
after seeing the advocate.

917
01:03:05,424 --> 01:03:07,793
You go. You can't see
the advocate even today.

918
01:03:07,793 --> 01:03:08,594
I'll see him & then only go.

919
01:03:08,594 --> 01:03:09,895
Then, you'll go only
after getting beaten.

920
01:03:09,895 --> 01:03:11,263
If you are your mother's son.
Open the gate.

921
01:03:11,263 --> 01:03:12,365
What will you do,
if I don't open?

922
01:03:12,365 --> 01:03:13,065
Get lost... You dog...

923
01:03:13,065 --> 01:03:14,767
Your aunt's husband
only is a dog.

924
01:03:14,767 --> 01:03:15,631
What is the problem?

925
01:03:16,602 --> 01:03:22,742
The auto rickshaw man who came yesterday
says that he want to see you.

926
01:03:22,742 --> 01:03:23,936
Open the gate.

927
01:03:24,610 --> 01:03:27,340
You won't allow me
to chase him.

928
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:30,376
Pierce it & come.
I'll go piercing.

929
01:03:34,887 --> 01:03:35,955
Good day sir!

930
01:03:35,955 --> 01:03:37,256
Who are you?
What do you want?

931
01:03:37,256 --> 01:03:40,159
My dear sir... I'm looking for you
since yesterday afternoon.

932
01:03:40,159 --> 01:03:40,826
Why?

933
01:03:40,826 --> 01:03:44,430
It was my bad time, a mother
& a daughter got in my auto rickshaw.

934
01:03:44,430 --> 01:03:46,665
Then, they didn't get down
& I couldn't drop them.

935
01:03:46,665 --> 01:03:50,069
I had to come to your house
& go to the police station several times.

936
01:03:50,069 --> 01:03:51,871
They don't want to go
without seeing you.

937
01:03:51,871 --> 01:03:53,939
They must get down
from my auto.

938
01:03:53,939 --> 01:03:55,236
Shall I call them sir?

939
01:03:56,342 --> 01:03:57,274
God saved me...

940
01:03:58,744 --> 01:04:01,042
Dear women... Get down.
I've found the advocate.

941
01:04:13,426 --> 01:04:16,327
Sir committed any mistake?

942
01:04:17,196 --> 01:04:18,754
Surely can't be.

943
01:04:19,432 --> 01:04:21,297
He is the advocate.
Tell him...

944
01:04:22,668 --> 01:04:24,703
Sir! You must save us.

945
01:04:24,703 --> 01:04:26,603
Who are you?
What's the problem?

946
01:04:27,807 --> 01:04:30,009
We are residing at Mangalapuram.

947
01:04:30,009 --> 01:04:32,645
My brother is a small merchant.

948
01:04:32,645 --> 01:04:38,784
My brother came to Cochin to purchase
things two days before, but didn't turn up.

949
01:04:38,784 --> 01:04:42,488
When we enquired,
we learned that he was arrested...

950
01:04:42,488 --> 01:04:45,591
In the case of the murder
of a judge's grandson.

951
01:04:45,591 --> 01:04:49,721
Sir! My son will never
harm even an ant.

952
01:04:50,496 --> 01:04:54,433
When we went to the police station
C.I. Jayachandran told us,

953
01:04:54,433 --> 01:04:57,570
that you would bring
my brother out, if we see you.

954
01:04:57,570 --> 01:04:59,505
We are pitiable... Sir.

955
01:04:59,505 --> 01:05:02,174
Without anyone.
Please help us.

956
01:05:02,174 --> 01:05:05,578
I can't help. The murdered boy's
family is well known to me.

957
01:05:05,578 --> 01:05:06,545
You may go.

958
01:05:06,545 --> 01:05:09,014
My brother didn't do anything.

959
01:05:09,014 --> 01:05:11,984
If anything happens
to my brother. Then... We...

960
01:05:11,984 --> 01:05:14,186
My son is innocent, sir.

961
01:05:14,186 --> 01:05:15,813
Let the court decide
whether he is innocent.

962
01:05:17,123 --> 01:05:18,591
Sir! If you desert them,

963
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:21,321
you'll see two dead bodies in a lake
or on the railway track tomorrow.

964
01:05:22,661 --> 01:05:24,163
They are in such a condition sir.

965
01:05:24,163 --> 01:05:26,532
We don't know what to do sir.

966
01:05:26,532 --> 01:05:33,438
You must consider me as your
own mother & help us to live.

967
01:05:34,874 --> 01:05:36,808
Come with me...

968
01:05:41,247 --> 01:05:44,517
Won't you always tell me
about your mother,

969
01:05:44,517 --> 01:05:49,250
who stood at the entrance of the judge
Viiswanathan for help some years back.

970
01:05:51,123 --> 01:05:56,925
When I see this mother's face,
I remember that.

971
01:06:08,407 --> 01:06:10,534
Whatever it is,
I'll see C.I. Jayachandran.

972
01:06:11,744 --> 01:06:13,371
You bring them
to the station.

973
01:06:19,218 --> 01:06:22,621
I only told Bhavani
& her daughter to see you.

974
01:06:22,621 --> 01:06:26,325
I know that Devan who was arrested
by S.P. Punnekkadan as murderer.

975
01:06:26,325 --> 01:06:27,660
He is innocent.

976
01:06:27,660 --> 01:06:30,529
He couldn't have
done this murder.

977
01:06:30,529 --> 01:06:31,291
I'm sure.

978
01:06:32,164 --> 01:06:35,034
Punnekkadan has
enmity like a snake.

979
01:06:35,034 --> 01:06:40,105
How could Punnekkadan come to the spot,
when Arun Kumar was murdered?

980
01:06:40,105 --> 01:06:44,143
And saw the murder directly
& arrested the accused?

981
01:06:44,143 --> 01:06:46,111
I doubt it.

982
01:06:46,111 --> 01:06:47,146
What doubt?

983
01:06:47,146 --> 01:06:49,876
Might be it is my guessing...

984
01:06:50,416 --> 01:06:53,852
This Punnekkadan has close
relationship with the criminals here.

985
01:06:53,852 --> 01:06:57,756
Punnekkadan has an involvement
in this murder

986
01:06:57,756 --> 01:07:03,262
he has arrested Devan only
to save the real culprit.

987
01:07:03,262 --> 01:07:06,232
You should keep this with
yourself, what I said now.

988
01:07:06,232 --> 01:07:07,666
I'm sure of one thing.

989
01:07:07,666 --> 01:07:10,769
If you decide,
you can save an innocent.

990
01:07:10,769 --> 01:07:12,600
You only can do that.

991
01:07:21,614 --> 01:07:23,182
Let me try...

992
01:07:23,182 --> 01:07:24,945
Dear! Don't worry...

993
01:07:25,551 --> 01:07:28,954
If I had known that it is your
own brother's case yesterday itself,

994
01:07:28,954 --> 01:07:32,287
I would have made him
accept this case.

995
01:07:32,558 --> 01:07:35,322
Because I like you so much.

996
01:07:35,828 --> 01:07:38,592
Don't stand there gaping.
Your sir is coming.

997
01:07:39,398 --> 01:07:41,525
This sir won't allow loving.

998
01:07:45,371 --> 01:07:46,572
You want to see Devan?

999
01:07:46,572 --> 01:07:47,172
Yes sir.

1000
01:07:47,172 --> 01:07:48,507
Bring them to the sub jail.

1001
01:07:48,507 --> 01:07:49,541
Come child...

1002
01:07:49,541 --> 01:07:51,910
I shall come with them
in the auto to show the route.

1003
01:07:51,910 --> 01:07:53,878
Can go with that parrot.

1004
01:07:54,980 --> 01:07:56,915
Mother wait... You go...

1005
01:07:56,915 --> 01:07:58,473
Now you get in.

1006
01:07:59,318 --> 01:08:00,419
Now you get in.

1007
01:08:00,419 --> 01:08:02,021
Why should I get in now?

1008
01:08:02,021 --> 01:08:05,557
Instead of sitting by this old woman,
it'll better to sit by the statue at Palayam.

1009
01:08:05,557 --> 01:08:06,692
You go. I'll come by the car.

1010
01:08:06,692 --> 01:08:07,826
Oh God!
Let them miss the route.

1011
01:08:07,826 --> 01:08:09,428
Oh! Car has gone.

1012
01:08:09,428 --> 01:08:10,596
Now I'll come in this.

1013
01:08:10,596 --> 01:08:11,688
Come by a bullock cart.

1014
01:08:12,931 --> 01:08:17,027
Car & auto have gone, I wanted
to guide them, but I'm stranded now.

1015
01:08:28,147 --> 01:08:28,977
Deva...

1016
01:08:36,689 --> 01:08:38,213
Your mother & sister
have come to see you.

1017
01:08:41,694 --> 01:08:43,559
Advocate Ramesh Nambiyar
also has come with them.

1018
01:08:52,271 --> 01:08:55,040
If Ramesh Nambiyar represent you,
you'll be saved.

1019
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:55,836
Come...

1020
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:10,418
Son... Deva...

1021
01:09:18,630 --> 01:09:20,599
I'm advocate, Ramesh Nambiyar.

1022
01:09:20,599 --> 01:09:23,659
Sir! I didn't kill anyone.

1023
01:09:25,537 --> 01:09:30,943
You have never done any harm to anyone,
then how could this happen to you?

1024
01:09:30,943 --> 01:09:33,912
From the time she heard
that you were arrested,

1025
01:09:33,912 --> 01:09:37,416
she wanted to see you
& never stopped crying.

1026
01:09:37,416 --> 01:09:38,280
Brother...

1027
01:09:38,951 --> 01:09:41,419
Don't cry, child...

1028
01:09:42,488 --> 01:09:45,821
Son...
Did the police torture you?

1029
01:09:46,925 --> 01:09:48,984
Who plotted against you?

1030
01:09:51,029 --> 01:09:53,665
If you go on crying like this,
there won't be time.

1031
01:09:53,665 --> 01:09:55,267
I want to ask certain
things to Devan.

1032
01:09:55,267 --> 01:09:56,291
You keep away for sometime.

1033
01:09:57,035 --> 01:09:58,002
Come...

1034
01:10:02,107 --> 01:10:03,709
What happened?

1035
01:10:03,709 --> 01:10:05,511
I didn't do any wrong, sir.

1036
01:10:05,511 --> 01:10:07,513
Then, how did you
become the accused?

1037
01:10:07,513 --> 01:10:10,549
This happened, when I tried to save
a person who was in danger.

1038
01:10:10,549 --> 01:10:11,784
Tell me in detail.

1039
01:10:11,784 --> 01:10:17,656
On the day that boy was murdered, I had
to go to Mangalapuram by the 12:30 train.

1040
01:10:17,656 --> 01:10:22,361
After packing the things
I purchased in the market.

1041
01:10:22,361 --> 01:10:27,699
I came out of the lodge
to the road to find an auto...

1042
01:10:27,699 --> 01:10:31,403
When I was waiting for the auto,
there was a scream.

1043
01:10:31,403 --> 01:10:36,568
When I turned to look,
I saw 2, 3 persons attacking a man.

1044
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:45,338
They ran away, when
they saw me going near.

1045
01:10:47,986 --> 01:10:53,559
I held that man
& pulled out the knife.

1046
01:10:53,559 --> 01:10:59,131
As I wanted to take him to the hospital,
I stopped a vehicle that came along.

1047
01:10:59,131 --> 01:11:00,899
That was a police vehicle.

1048
01:11:00,899 --> 01:11:03,094
The person who got down
from the vehicle was S.P.

1049
01:11:12,411 --> 01:11:16,415
He thought that I was the murderer
as I was holding the knife.

1050
01:11:16,415 --> 01:11:19,618
Though I told him many times, that
I didn't kill him, he didn't believe me.

1051
01:11:19,618 --> 01:11:22,054
The boy died in that time.

1052
01:11:22,054 --> 01:11:24,923
If an innocent pull the knife,
stabbed by the murderer,

1053
01:11:24,923 --> 01:11:27,292
the innocent will become
the suspect.

1054
01:11:27,292 --> 01:11:29,228
Keep one thing in your mind.

1055
01:11:29,228 --> 01:11:32,264
The eye witness in this case is not
an ordinary man, a police officer.

1056
01:11:32,264 --> 01:11:35,427
He has locked all the ways
from rescuing you.

1057
01:11:36,668 --> 01:11:40,172
There is nobody else than me
for my mother & sister.

1058
01:11:40,172 --> 01:11:42,732
No way to help.

1059
01:11:44,343 --> 01:11:45,503
Time is up.

1060
01:11:48,547 --> 01:11:50,708
You only can save me.

1061
01:12:09,034 --> 01:12:10,399
Sir! You didn't say anything.

1062
01:12:11,136 --> 01:12:15,539
All the evidences are against Devan,
but he didn't kill our Arun.

1063
01:12:16,441 --> 01:12:20,145
If an innocent is punished,
the culprit will escape.

1064
01:12:20,145 --> 01:12:24,445
To bring the culprit before the law,
Devan must be rescued.

1065
01:12:25,817 --> 01:12:27,252
What do you say, sir?

1066
01:12:27,252 --> 01:12:29,221
Do what you feel is right.

1067
01:12:29,221 --> 01:12:31,155
I have confidence in you.

1068
01:12:40,198 --> 01:12:43,936
How did you go to the place
of the incident at the exact time?

1069
01:12:43,936 --> 01:12:45,404
Everything happened
accidentally.

1070
01:12:45,404 --> 01:12:47,205
There was a function
at the police club.

1071
01:12:47,205 --> 01:12:49,875
On returning after attending that,
I saw the incident.

1072
01:12:49,875 --> 01:12:51,143
What did you see?

1073
01:12:51,143 --> 01:12:57,104
In the light of the head lights,
I saw Devan stabbing Arun Kumar.

1074
01:13:03,655 --> 01:13:05,357
Then, what happened?

1075
01:13:05,357 --> 01:13:09,027
Though I asked him many times,
he didn't tell anything about his associates.

1076
01:13:09,027 --> 01:13:11,163
How did you know that
there were associates?

1077
01:13:11,163 --> 01:13:16,034
I saw some men getting in a
vehicle at the spot of the incident.

1078
01:13:16,034 --> 01:13:17,970
Why didn't you follow
that vehicle?

1079
01:13:17,970 --> 01:13:22,304
I thought that this accused
would escape, if I follow them.

1080
01:13:30,949 --> 01:13:32,484
You saw the incident accidentally,

1081
01:13:32,484 --> 01:13:35,454
when you were returning from
the party at the police club, right?

1082
01:13:35,454 --> 01:13:36,655
That's what I said.

1083
01:13:36,655 --> 01:13:40,025
When you say the party at the club,
there must have been drinks.

1084
01:13:40,025 --> 01:13:42,427
How about you?
Do you drink?

1085
01:13:42,427 --> 01:13:43,328
Yes, I drink.

1086
01:13:43,328 --> 01:13:44,454
Did you drink on that day?

1087
01:13:45,998 --> 01:13:47,666
You've not answered
my question.

1088
01:13:47,666 --> 01:13:49,434
I drank.

1089
01:13:49,434 --> 01:13:50,469
How many pegs?

1090
01:13:50,469 --> 01:13:51,503
1 or 2.

1091
01:13:51,503 --> 01:13:53,572
Isn't it wrong to drive drunk?

1092
01:13:53,572 --> 01:13:56,708
That too driving
the police vehicle.

1093
01:13:56,708 --> 01:13:58,443
I didn't drive the vehicle.

1094
01:13:58,443 --> 01:13:59,910
It was driver Nagulan.

1095
01:14:04,282 --> 01:14:11,857
If I say that you drove S.P. Punnekkadan
who had taken drinks at the party in the club...

1096
01:14:11,857 --> 01:14:13,091
I agree.

1097
01:14:13,091 --> 01:14:13,725
How?

1098
01:14:13,725 --> 01:14:14,493
Just...

1099
01:14:14,493 --> 01:14:18,691
Sir had taken drinks,
but it was nothing for him.

1100
01:14:20,399 --> 01:14:21,433
Why?

1101
01:14:21,433 --> 01:14:24,569
5, 8 pegs are like a handful
to an elephant to sir.

1102
01:14:24,569 --> 01:14:27,105
What a capacity?
Can't you see from his body?

1103
01:14:27,105 --> 01:14:33,305
Once at a party in the police club
he drank a full bottle & won a prize.

1104
01:14:35,313 --> 01:14:36,515
On the day of the incident?

1105
01:14:36,515 --> 01:14:37,416
That was very interesting...

1106
01:14:37,416 --> 01:14:40,686
There was a competition with
Kottayam S.P. Gopalan on that day.

1107
01:14:40,686 --> 01:14:41,386
So...

1108
01:14:41,386 --> 01:14:46,380
He proved that no policeman in Kerala
can compete him in drinking.

1109
01:14:50,829 --> 01:14:52,558
Has it become
a problem boosting you?

1110
01:14:56,368 --> 01:14:57,266
Do you drink?

1111
01:14:58,036 --> 01:15:01,306
In a party anybody will drink,
nothing wrong in that.

1112
01:15:01,306 --> 01:15:02,674
Were you drunk while driving?

1113
01:15:02,674 --> 01:15:04,776
Sir will kick me, if I drive drunk.

1114
01:15:04,776 --> 01:15:07,212
Slightly before taking the vehicle.

1115
01:15:07,212 --> 01:15:08,645
You drank?
Secretely.

1116
01:15:10,015 --> 01:15:13,785
Did you see this Devan
stabbing Arun Kumar?

1117
01:15:13,785 --> 01:15:14,683
Yes sir.

1118
01:15:15,821 --> 01:15:19,091
Did you see him stabbing
or pulling out the knife?

1119
01:15:19,091 --> 01:15:21,960
Or standing with
the knife pulled out?

1120
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:24,062
You saw only the knife
being pulled out?

1121
01:15:24,062 --> 01:15:25,529
I saw him standing with
the knife pulled out.

1122
01:15:27,432 --> 01:15:28,700
You may go.

1123
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:29,667
Ok sir.

1124
01:15:32,170 --> 01:15:37,442
Devan pulled out the knife
to save the person on the way.

1125
01:15:37,442 --> 01:15:42,047
He stopped the vehicle only
to take him to the hospital.

1126
01:15:42,047 --> 01:15:45,183
S.P. Punnekkadan who was
in that vehicle drunk,

1127
01:15:45,183 --> 01:15:47,486
decided that
Devan was the murderer.

1128
01:15:47,486 --> 01:15:55,086
When S.P. Punnekkadan arrested Devan,
the real murderer escaped & a life was lost.

1129
01:15:56,194 --> 01:15:59,731
If S.P. Punnekkadan is really
value the human life,

1130
01:15:59,731 --> 01:16:05,033
he should have tried to
save the murdered person.

1131
01:16:05,303 --> 01:16:11,443
Forgetting that, dreaming about
the promotions & the medals...

1132
01:16:11,443 --> 01:16:14,571
He has arrested an innocent person
& brought him here.

1133
01:16:18,550 --> 01:16:21,753
Devan is a merchant
selling perfumes...

1134
01:16:21,753 --> 01:16:26,525
C.I. Jayachandran says that he usually
comes to Cochin to buy things...

1135
01:16:26,525 --> 01:16:30,195
The sleeper class reservation
ticket booked by Devan

1136
01:16:30,195 --> 01:16:34,655
& receipt for the purchase of the things
& the room rent bill are here.

1137
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:40,605
If the innocents are arrested instead
of the real culprits like Devan,

1138
01:16:40,605 --> 01:16:43,575
the Kerala jail would be
full of innocents.

1139
01:16:43,575 --> 01:16:45,710
Considering the facts...

1140
01:16:45,710 --> 01:16:52,411
I request your honor to declare my
client as innocent & release him.

1141
01:17:04,663 --> 01:17:07,332
In the murder case of Arun Kumar,

1142
01:17:07,332 --> 01:17:11,234
police & the prosecution have failed
to prove that Devarajan is the murderer.

1143
01:17:12,504 --> 01:17:17,642
As this court realize that the police
have framed Devarajan as an accused...

1144
01:17:17,642 --> 01:17:21,669
The court release Devarajan
as innocent.

1145
01:17:30,455 --> 01:17:35,126
This court appreciates Devan's
humanity to save a life.

1146
01:17:35,126 --> 01:17:42,334
This court condemns the act of the police
for making an innocent an accused.

1147
01:17:42,334 --> 01:17:46,498
This court orders the police
to find the real culprits.

1148
01:17:53,979 --> 01:17:55,981
Many thanks, sir...

1149
01:17:55,981 --> 01:17:57,649
We'll never forget you.

1150
01:17:57,649 --> 01:17:59,351
You are our God.

1151
01:17:59,351 --> 01:18:02,479
He is the one who heard your
prayer, I'm only a mediator.

1152
01:19:08,153 --> 01:19:11,088
When you cross examined
S.P. Punnekkadan, I had goose-bumps.

1153
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:23,268
Here... Take it.

1154
01:19:23,268 --> 01:19:26,671
10000, 20000... 30000.
Now the deal is over?

1155
01:19:26,671 --> 01:19:27,899
I'll take it.

1156
01:19:39,484 --> 01:19:41,519
Sir! Thank you so much.

1157
01:19:41,519 --> 01:19:44,389
Your men paid the entire
amount as agreed.

1158
01:19:44,389 --> 01:19:45,090
Maaveli Kara...

1159
01:19:45,090 --> 01:19:45,790
- Neelamma.

1160
01:19:45,790 --> 01:19:48,760
You played the role of my
late mother Devaki perfectly.

1161
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:51,863
You played the role perfectly without any
overacting though you are a stage artist,

1162
01:19:51,863 --> 01:19:54,058
even I thought that
you are my mother.

1163
01:20:07,278 --> 01:20:09,080
What is the name of the girl,
who acted as my sister?

1164
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:09,914
Ancy.

1165
01:20:09,914 --> 01:20:11,349
My grand daughter.

1166
01:20:11,349 --> 01:20:12,317
Grandma is very smart.

1167
01:20:12,317 --> 01:20:13,750
Grand daughter is smarter
than her.

1168
01:20:14,285 --> 01:20:17,118
Here... Double payment of
what Shankar brother promised.

1169
01:20:18,423 --> 01:20:19,491
I'll keep it.

1170
01:20:19,491 --> 01:20:22,560
You will waste the money by
buying some useless makeup things.

1171
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:23,228
You keep quiet.

1172
01:20:23,228 --> 01:20:23,862
Vehicle is ready.

1173
01:20:23,862 --> 01:20:25,497
Bye sir...

1174
01:20:25,497 --> 01:20:27,260
Call me without fail,
if such occasions occur.

1175
01:20:29,701 --> 01:20:30,599
Advocate sir...

1176
01:20:31,803 --> 01:20:32,667
One minute...

1177
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:43,748
I thought of seeing you
at your house.

1178
01:20:43,748 --> 01:20:46,618
Then I thought not to postpone
doing good deeds.

1179
01:20:46,618 --> 01:20:50,055
Advocate Ramesh Nambiyar
who charge lakhs for a sitting...

1180
01:20:50,055 --> 01:20:52,148
Here blank cheque; fill up
whatever amount you want.

1181
01:20:53,258 --> 01:20:54,282
Who are you?

1182
01:20:55,160 --> 01:20:56,928
You should have asked
this before.

1183
01:20:56,928 --> 01:20:57,962
Still I'll tell.

1184
01:20:57,962 --> 01:20:59,431
If I don't tell,
how could you know?

1185
01:20:59,431 --> 01:21:01,266
How could I be happy,
if you don't know?

1186
01:21:01,266 --> 01:21:07,772
I'm a poor Varma. Devan... Devarajan.
Devaraja Prathapa Varma.

1187
01:21:07,772 --> 01:21:08,940
Devji for these men.

1188
01:21:08,940 --> 01:21:13,378
I'm related by way of my mother
to South Thiruvithancoor.

1189
01:21:13,378 --> 01:21:15,780
Father belongs to North Kerala.
Othenan's place.

1190
01:21:15,780 --> 01:21:18,248
When that South & North joined,
I became like this.

1191
01:21:19,451 --> 01:21:21,351
Advocate can't
understand anything, right?

1192
01:21:23,054 --> 01:21:27,992
Since you forgot the justice or bent it,
because of your duty to your teacher...

1193
01:21:27,992 --> 01:21:29,928
It was I who lost the justice,
I deserved.

1194
01:21:29,928 --> 01:21:37,268
When you got Arun Kumar, a criminal released
from this court easily, my heart broke.

1195
01:21:37,268 --> 01:21:39,804
Then,
I didn't have any choice.

1196
01:21:39,804 --> 01:21:43,035
According to my conscious,
I decided his fate.

1197
01:21:47,712 --> 01:21:50,915
What S.P. Antony Punnekkadan said
in this court is totally true.

1198
01:21:50,915 --> 01:21:53,145
I only killed him...
With these hands...

1199
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:57,322
Why are you so furious?

1200
01:21:57,322 --> 01:22:00,258
I told the truth,
that I pulled out the knife.

1201
01:22:00,258 --> 01:22:02,193
I didn't deny stabbing him.

1202
01:22:02,193 --> 01:22:04,395
You only thought like that...

1203
01:22:04,395 --> 01:22:08,166
The same court which released Arun...
The same advocate who saved him.

1204
01:22:08,166 --> 01:22:10,702
Proved me who killed Arun
as innocent.

1205
01:22:10,702 --> 01:22:12,504
There is a proverb in our tradition,

1206
01:22:12,504 --> 01:22:14,372
that the poison must be sucked
by the same snake that bit.

1207
01:22:14,372 --> 01:22:15,607
Isn't it, circle?

1208
01:22:15,607 --> 01:22:18,409
If you agree,
we'll stay together.

1209
01:22:18,409 --> 01:22:21,346
I've two more
death sentences to give.

1210
01:22:21,346 --> 01:22:26,340
I'll be a little busy as I have to be
the judge as well as the executor.

1211
01:22:27,886 --> 01:22:28,887
We'll see.

1212
01:22:28,887 --> 01:22:30,980
Must see.

1213
01:22:32,824 --> 01:22:33,950
Will see.

1214
01:22:39,330 --> 01:22:42,163
Must drink water also
separately in the middle, sir.

1215
01:22:48,373 --> 01:22:54,379
Who won in all the cases
got a kick back today.

1216
01:22:54,379 --> 01:22:55,480
Devan.

1217
01:22:55,480 --> 01:22:59,250
I heard that Viswanathan family beat
and chased the advocate

1218
01:22:59,250 --> 01:23:00,418
...who saved the real culprit.

1219
01:23:00,418 --> 01:23:01,519
Is it true?

1220
01:23:01,519 --> 01:23:04,756
My mother...
You heard my prayer.

1221
01:23:04,756 --> 01:23:06,524
Shall I pour one more
for that pleasure?

1222
01:23:06,524 --> 01:23:07,959
No. Sir is already over.

1223
01:23:07,959 --> 01:23:13,998
What do you think of sir? According to
the court & the station sir is a drunkard.

1224
01:23:13,998 --> 01:23:19,037
You only told in the court that
I'll drink a full bottle?

1225
01:23:19,037 --> 01:23:20,672
I told that to show
the weight of sir...

1226
01:23:20,672 --> 01:23:22,707
I will... You...

1227
01:23:22,707 --> 01:23:24,776
Punnekkada...

1228
01:23:24,776 --> 01:23:26,744
I'll tell you something...

1229
01:23:26,744 --> 01:23:30,682
I'll close the kitchen at 10'o clock
in the night, & bedroom at 11'o clock...

1230
01:23:30,682 --> 01:23:34,719
My dear Alice! This is my last peg.
Don't get mad.

1231
01:23:34,719 --> 01:23:37,655
He is a tiger before the police,
but a rat before Alice.

1232
01:23:37,655 --> 01:23:40,325
I heard...

1233
01:23:40,325 --> 01:23:42,860
I didn't say that.
Your enemies say that.

1234
01:23:42,860 --> 01:23:44,696
I'll find that.
Ok.

1235
01:23:44,696 --> 01:23:48,188
My wife is my D.G.P.

1236
01:23:49,234 --> 01:23:52,003
Isn't it Alice?
You go, Punnekkada...

1237
01:23:52,003 --> 01:23:53,300
Poor girl...

1238
01:23:54,672 --> 01:23:57,038
Who is flashing torch
in the face?

1239
01:23:58,076 --> 01:24:00,738
No use in anybody coming now.
The stuff is over.

1240
01:24:08,152 --> 01:24:09,687
Who is this?

1241
01:24:09,687 --> 01:24:11,990
Slowly...

1242
01:24:11,990 --> 01:24:14,759
What is this advocate sir,
have you entered in a wrong house?

1243
01:24:14,759 --> 01:24:17,829
This is Antony Punnekkadan's house,
given as dowry.

1244
01:24:17,829 --> 01:24:19,558
I've come to see you only.

1245
01:24:20,331 --> 01:24:21,966
Have to talk
to you personally.

1246
01:24:21,966 --> 01:24:27,927
You fried me in the court,
now what do you want to talk?

1247
01:24:30,041 --> 01:24:32,744
If you want to talk,
talk before them.

1248
01:24:32,744 --> 01:24:34,178
I've committed a mistake.

1249
01:24:34,178 --> 01:24:36,381
Without thinking or enquiring,

1250
01:24:36,381 --> 01:24:39,248
I believed him as innocent, taking
the words of that C.I. Jayachandran.

1251
01:24:44,589 --> 01:24:46,113
He has an idea of killing
two more persons.

1252
01:24:48,426 --> 01:24:52,630
Something wrong, somewhere.
I'm afraid even to think.

1253
01:24:52,630 --> 01:24:53,722
What to do now?

1254
01:24:54,766 --> 01:24:59,604
To say again in raw Malayalam,
there is a word in police language...

1255
01:24:59,604 --> 01:25:00,662
You go...

1256
01:25:01,706 --> 01:25:04,876
Standing at the foot
of superior officers,

1257
01:25:04,876 --> 01:25:09,580
when police like us catch
the criminals risking our life

1258
01:25:09,580 --> 01:25:11,616
& bring them before the court...

1259
01:25:11,616 --> 01:25:14,952
Wearing a black gown unwashed
for months advocates like you

1260
01:25:14,952 --> 01:25:19,524
...come to the court like bats
& save them.

1261
01:25:19,524 --> 01:25:21,389
Must think about that.

1262
01:25:24,429 --> 01:25:29,467
Your superior officers will help me.

1263
01:25:29,467 --> 01:25:33,631
After taking two pegs Antony Punnekkadan
will become Antony Pannekkadan.

1264
01:25:36,741 --> 01:25:38,142
What do you want me to do?

1265
01:25:38,142 --> 01:25:41,746
Do you want me to investigate this
case again by S.P. Punnekkadan?

1266
01:25:41,746 --> 01:25:42,847
No... Don't.

1267
01:25:42,847 --> 01:25:48,653
Let him alone till his boiling blood come
to normal. He is a No.1 egoist.

1268
01:25:48,653 --> 01:25:50,288
Then, what is your intention?

1269
01:25:50,288 --> 01:25:54,892
Appoint a C.I.D. to mingle
with Devan to know about him.

1270
01:25:54,892 --> 01:25:56,294
But he should not look like
a police man.

1271
01:25:56,294 --> 01:25:58,696
Is there anyone like that
in your department?

1272
01:25:58,696 --> 01:26:03,134
In that case... There is a man.
A conferred I.P.S.

1273
01:26:03,134 --> 01:26:05,703
He is an expert in investigating
the cases under disguise.

1274
01:26:05,703 --> 01:26:06,504
A Kabish.

1275
01:26:06,504 --> 01:26:07,572
Kabish?

1276
01:26:07,572 --> 01:26:10,441
Oh! Sorry... It is the nickname
for him in the department.

1277
01:26:10,441 --> 01:26:12,910
Kabish is the name of
a monkey in "Balamasi".

1278
01:26:12,910 --> 01:26:16,346
Original name is Indhuchudan,
can understand by his speaking.

1279
01:26:20,318 --> 01:26:21,719
Who is that Devan?

1280
01:26:21,719 --> 01:26:23,020
Where is that Devan?

1281
01:26:23,020 --> 01:26:26,991
Who is in front of Devan & who is
at the back of Devan? Jealousy...

1282
01:26:26,991 --> 01:26:33,664
Don't imagine enquiring
all these things.

1283
01:26:33,664 --> 01:26:37,135
This case has been transferred
to a person in our department

1284
01:26:37,135 --> 01:26:40,271
...who is called Narasimhan.

1285
01:26:40,271 --> 01:26:45,376
As far as I know the case has been given
to a person called Kabish in the department.

1286
01:26:45,376 --> 01:26:48,613
Kabish
Kabish?

1287
01:26:48,613 --> 01:26:49,614
Radish.

1288
01:26:49,614 --> 01:26:52,742
I thought that you called
my nickname in the department.

1289
01:26:57,255 --> 01:26:59,123
I want the copy.

1290
01:26:59,123 --> 01:27:00,425
Coffee will come now.

1291
01:27:00,425 --> 01:27:03,761
I don't want coffee,
I want copy...

1292
01:27:03,761 --> 01:27:08,065
I want the full details of Devan.

1293
01:27:08,065 --> 01:27:11,669
If you had enquired about him using your
muscle, I'll enquire him using my head.

1294
01:27:11,669 --> 01:27:13,638
My head is my rice.

1295
01:27:13,638 --> 01:27:20,134
Devan is not an ordinary man,
your brain will be totally shattered.

1296
01:27:21,679 --> 01:27:22,980
You come here...

1297
01:27:22,980 --> 01:27:26,245
I'm going to investigate
this case in a new method.

1298
01:27:27,652 --> 01:27:28,986
Going to investigate as a cook?

1299
01:27:28,986 --> 01:27:29,787
How did you know?

1300
01:27:29,787 --> 01:27:31,456
How could you forget
the family business?

1301
01:27:31,456 --> 01:27:35,626
I'm not that old Indhuchudan,
society calls me as Narasimhan.

1302
01:27:35,626 --> 01:27:37,228
Who said? I have not heard.

1303
01:27:37,228 --> 01:27:40,231
Nobody say that because of
jealousy, so I say it myself.

1304
01:27:40,231 --> 01:27:41,232
Harish...

1305
01:27:41,232 --> 01:27:41,833
Kabish?

1306
01:27:41,833 --> 01:27:43,494
Not Kabish. Harish...

1307
01:27:44,802 --> 01:27:46,504
Give him whatever he asks.

1308
01:27:46,504 --> 01:27:48,699
I want some money,
will he give?

1309
01:27:50,775 --> 01:27:53,539
If you had said this get out before,
I would have gone early.

1310
01:27:57,815 --> 01:27:59,373
Whoever you are,
come with me.

1311
01:28:13,865 --> 01:28:14,532
It's disconnected.

1312
01:28:14,532 --> 01:28:16,467
What sir? You must keep
your gun there?

1313
01:28:16,467 --> 01:28:18,992
Why should we give weapon
to the enemies?

1314
01:28:21,005 --> 01:28:22,106
Don't you have eyes?

1315
01:28:22,106 --> 01:28:23,300
Yes sir, here...

1316
01:28:24,208 --> 01:28:25,376
Sir... You are Narasimham...

1317
01:28:25,376 --> 01:28:26,744
Yes... It's me.

1318
01:28:26,744 --> 01:28:28,412
The case of Devan

1319
01:28:28,412 --> 01:28:31,404
...who was accused in Arun Kumar's case is
now being investigated discreetly by sir.

1320
01:28:32,517 --> 01:28:34,852
Are you a police or a mad man,
wearing police uniform?

1321
01:28:34,852 --> 01:28:35,353
No sir. I...

1322
01:28:35,353 --> 01:28:36,581
You should not talk
about this openly.

1323
01:28:37,088 --> 01:28:40,258
This matter should not be revealed
to a third person other than us.

1324
01:28:40,258 --> 01:28:45,252
Don't you know that you should salute,
when you see a senior officer?

1325
01:28:47,532 --> 01:28:49,796
Don't forget to salute,
when you see again.

1326
01:28:50,902 --> 01:28:53,871
I've made them salute me.

1327
01:29:02,013 --> 01:29:04,115
It's me, Jayachandran.

1328
01:29:04,115 --> 01:29:05,182
What Jaya?

1329
01:29:05,182 --> 01:29:10,755
An officer has been appointed by the
department to enquire about you discreetly.

1330
01:29:10,755 --> 01:29:12,256
S.P. Indhuchudan.

1331
01:29:12,256 --> 01:29:14,592
He might come there
at any time. Take care...

1332
01:29:14,592 --> 01:29:15,459
How does he look?

1333
01:29:15,459 --> 01:29:19,452
Can't say that he is a S.P.
A look of a beggar who won a lottery.

1334
01:29:27,738 --> 01:29:31,475
A person with the look of
a Negro is at the gate now.

1335
01:29:31,475 --> 01:29:33,010
Must be him.

1336
01:29:33,010 --> 01:29:37,214
He will use the word Narasimham
in the middle of talking.

1337
01:29:37,214 --> 01:29:39,307
Then, you confirm
he must be the one.

1338
01:29:40,551 --> 01:29:42,018
You stand there.

1339
01:29:42,720 --> 01:29:45,289
Deva! There is
a Malayali Negro at outside.

1340
01:29:45,289 --> 01:29:47,158
Wants the job of a cook.

1341
01:29:47,158 --> 01:29:48,726
Won't go, when I said "No".

1342
01:29:48,726 --> 01:29:51,596
He doesn't want to go without seeing you;
he says that he is Narasimhan in cooking.

1343
01:29:51,596 --> 01:29:52,763
Secretary! He is a S.P.

1344
01:29:52,763 --> 01:29:53,798
Police?

1345
01:29:53,798 --> 01:29:56,267
Bring him inside;
we'll give him a job.

1346
01:29:56,267 --> 01:29:57,291
Call him.

1347
01:29:59,570 --> 01:30:00,798
He has asked you
to come inside.

1348
01:30:09,347 --> 01:30:12,149
Though my name & appearance
seem to be a foreigner...

1349
01:30:12,149 --> 01:30:13,584
I'm a Malayali of Kasar.

1350
01:30:13,584 --> 01:30:16,348
But looks like a tribal Malayali.

1351
01:30:19,957 --> 01:30:21,759
In which post office did
you say in Africa?

1352
01:30:21,759 --> 01:30:25,630
Africans used to say that
I'm a Narasimhan in cooking.

1353
01:30:25,630 --> 01:30:26,831
Then, why did you
leave Africa?

1354
01:30:26,831 --> 01:30:29,967
He might not have left Africa,
Africa might have left him.

1355
01:30:29,967 --> 01:30:32,236
What do you expect from here?

1356
01:30:32,236 --> 01:30:38,643
When I saw him eating in the hotel & taking
parcel, I knew that a cook is required here.

1357
01:30:38,643 --> 01:30:43,014
This looked like
a house of status, so I tried.

1358
01:30:43,014 --> 01:30:48,819
Your look makes a cook to like you;
all of you look like good eaters.

1359
01:30:48,819 --> 01:30:51,288
I'll kill you all by making you eat.

1360
01:30:51,288 --> 01:30:53,457
I won't worry about the salary,
department will take care of it.

1361
01:30:53,457 --> 01:30:54,859
What department? Tell...

1362
01:30:54,859 --> 01:30:56,690
Food Variety corporation.

1363
01:30:58,195 --> 01:31:01,832
He seems to be a smart man, we can
keep him to scold others & mother.

1364
01:31:01,832 --> 01:31:03,026
Good
You can say father also.

1365
01:31:03,134 --> 01:31:05,625
Not that... Acha means good.

1366
01:31:05,936 --> 01:31:08,632
Give him a gift
& bring him inside.

1367
01:31:09,707 --> 01:31:13,165
From you...
From wherever bless me & give.

1368
01:31:18,582 --> 01:31:21,485
Is beating, a gift?

1369
01:31:21,485 --> 01:31:25,423
No. This is a test to see
whether a servant hit back.

1370
01:31:25,423 --> 01:31:26,157
A small beating.

1371
01:31:26,157 --> 01:31:28,526
Why didn't you give a clue that
the beating starts here?

1372
01:31:28,526 --> 01:31:31,095
This is only a small beating. If the tea
is bad, there will be immediate beating.

1373
01:31:31,095 --> 01:31:32,596
Understand? Go...

1374
01:31:32,596 --> 01:31:34,587
This is not going to work out.

1375
01:31:56,620 --> 01:32:00,658
This is Mahendran, the husband of Justice
Viiswanathan's younger daughter Padmini.

1376
01:32:00,658 --> 01:32:02,148
He has a resort at Bangalore.

1377
01:32:11,135 --> 01:32:14,371
This is Ganeshan, son of the
elder daughter of the Justice.

1378
01:32:14,371 --> 01:32:17,033
He is also a partner
in Mahendran's business.

1379
01:32:22,012 --> 01:32:27,951
Devji! They have reserved in the evening
5:30 Delhi flight on 25th of this month.

1380
01:32:32,590 --> 01:32:35,726
Tell me! Who were
with you on that day?

1381
01:32:35,726 --> 01:32:36,827
Tell...

1382
01:32:36,827 --> 01:32:39,091
Ganeshan & Mahendran...
My relatives.

1383
01:32:44,135 --> 01:32:48,595
Even if you are released by any court,
you'll be punished in Devan's court.

1384
01:33:16,934 --> 01:33:18,502
Anything to drink?

1385
01:33:18,502 --> 01:33:20,838
Not here, go & drink
in the kitchen.

1386
01:33:20,838 --> 01:33:22,039
Not for me, sir...

1387
01:33:22,039 --> 01:33:23,028
No...

1388
01:33:24,542 --> 01:33:26,710
Shall I give something to bite?

1389
01:33:26,710 --> 01:33:30,714
Undan pori(snack). In our country
we call evening snack as "Bite".

1390
01:33:30,714 --> 01:33:33,274
No. Bring the waste box here,
from the hall.

1391
01:33:45,196 --> 01:33:47,097
Paste this cover & give it
to Shankar brother.

1392
01:33:47,097 --> 01:33:48,325
It should go by courier today.

1393
01:33:49,400 --> 01:33:51,300
Hey! Don't open it & read.

1394
01:33:58,742 --> 01:34:00,744
Madhava Menon Thiruvambadi.

1395
01:34:00,744 --> 01:34:03,110
This courier will change my career.

1396
01:34:04,048 --> 01:34:04,615
See this, an anonymous letter
without name & address.

1397
01:34:04,615 --> 01:34:07,914
See this, an anonymous letter
without name & address.

1398
01:34:09,053 --> 01:34:13,490
The maximum punishment of the state
to this Mahendran & Ganeshan.

1399
01:34:13,490 --> 01:34:14,388
Death punishment.

1400
01:34:15,226 --> 01:34:17,261
On 25th January means day
after tomorrow.

1401
01:34:17,261 --> 01:34:19,889
It is written that the punishment will be
executed before 3'o clock in the evening.

1402
01:34:19,964 --> 01:34:20,726
Sir! You read...

1403
01:34:21,966 --> 01:34:24,168
Balu brother!
What happened to you?

1404
01:34:24,168 --> 01:34:27,204
Why have you called the police
for an anonymous letter?

1405
01:34:27,204 --> 01:34:29,907
We'll take care of ourselves.
You don't interfere.

1406
01:34:29,907 --> 01:34:32,109
This is not a simple matter,
Mahendra.

1407
01:34:32,109 --> 01:34:35,412
Don't you remember? Such a letter
came before Arun's murder.

1408
01:34:35,412 --> 01:34:38,282
When Balu brother told me on that day,
I only didn't pay heed.

1409
01:34:38,282 --> 01:34:42,620
Sir! We have not forgotten
the loss of Arun yet.

1410
01:34:42,620 --> 01:34:45,689
We can't stand another
incident like that.

1411
01:34:45,689 --> 01:34:48,926
How could it be good? We have seen
this man only on the New Year.

1412
01:34:48,926 --> 01:34:51,562
Then, what about my matter?
I've seen you all only.

1413
01:34:51,562 --> 01:34:53,427
Why are you standing away?

1414
01:34:54,398 --> 01:34:56,433
I've a doubt.

1415
01:34:56,433 --> 01:34:59,069
Devan must be the
one behind this.

1416
01:34:59,069 --> 01:35:02,273
The release of him by the court
as innocent &...

1417
01:35:02,273 --> 01:35:04,208
The respect he got
for his humanity...

1418
01:35:04,208 --> 01:35:10,848
& the police department in which I serve
stood with bent heads for arresting him.

1419
01:35:10,848 --> 01:35:12,082
You also saw that, sir?

1420
01:35:12,082 --> 01:35:14,318
Then, why do you drag
that poor Devan in this?

1421
01:35:14,318 --> 01:35:17,187
Antony! I can understand
your feelings.

1422
01:35:17,187 --> 01:35:24,094
Advocate Ramesh Nambiar avoided you
only because of your short temper.

1423
01:35:24,094 --> 01:35:28,899
You have sent that Indhuchudan without
believing me to investigate the case...

1424
01:35:28,899 --> 01:35:31,299
Call him & ask him whether
he got something.

1425
01:35:32,336 --> 01:35:35,931
That man works as a cook now
at Devan's guest house.

1426
01:35:36,874 --> 01:35:38,000
That is the job suitable to him.

1427
01:35:48,786 --> 01:35:50,151
Isn't it your phone? Take it.

1428
01:35:54,558 --> 01:35:56,753
I've heard of African payal,
but African father?

1429
01:35:59,430 --> 01:36:00,364
Father?

1430
01:36:00,364 --> 01:36:01,398
Where are you now?

1431
01:36:01,398 --> 01:36:05,436
I'm frying fishes at
Devan's kitchen now, over...

1432
01:36:05,436 --> 01:36:07,870
Who is over?

1433
01:36:08,205 --> 01:36:10,765
This Shankar will not be
over for two pegs.

1434
01:36:12,609 --> 01:36:14,445
What is that sound like
crackers fired?

1435
01:36:14,445 --> 01:36:17,881
No crackers. It was the sound
of me getting slapped.

1436
01:36:17,881 --> 01:36:20,651
These people think that
I'm a Drum.

1437
01:36:20,651 --> 01:36:22,586
Everybody will play on me.

1438
01:36:22,586 --> 01:36:25,255
No problem sir.
Why did you call?

1439
01:36:25,255 --> 01:36:28,292
Do you know whether anybody
has sent a courier from there?

1440
01:36:28,292 --> 01:36:30,461
To Thiruvambadi, right?

1441
01:36:30,461 --> 01:36:31,161
Yes.

1442
01:36:31,161 --> 01:36:34,231
I only pasted & sent it.

1443
01:36:34,231 --> 01:36:38,135
Courier has come from there only,
did you read that?

1444
01:36:38,135 --> 01:36:42,765
Not only reading. I'm having
the Photostat copies of that.

1445
01:36:44,074 --> 01:36:45,075
See, he is going to read.

1446
01:36:45,075 --> 01:36:46,577
You read that.

1447
01:36:46,577 --> 01:36:48,145
Listen...

1448
01:36:48,145 --> 01:36:50,180
Preparation of Malabar
Fish curry.

1449
01:36:50,180 --> 01:36:52,383
Cleaned fish - 2 Kgs.

1450
01:36:52,383 --> 01:36:54,018
Chilly powder-as required.

1451
01:36:54,018 --> 01:36:55,419
Coriander powder-as required.

1452
01:36:55,419 --> 01:36:56,653
Tamarind - 50 Gms.

1453
01:36:56,653 --> 01:36:58,621
Chopped ginger - 50 Gms.

1454
01:37:02,259 --> 01:37:06,430
When you ask about murder,
he talks about cooking fish.

1455
01:37:06,430 --> 01:37:09,490
Sir! He has only one sense.
Non-sense.

1456
01:37:12,569 --> 01:37:15,402
I'll sack the culprits with all evidences.

1457
01:37:16,540 --> 01:37:22,746
I'll be in full responsibility of this case;
there should not be any parallel officer to me.

1458
01:37:22,746 --> 01:37:26,978
There should not be any superior other than
you either to change me or transfer.

1459
01:37:45,836 --> 01:37:47,633
Devji! I'm at the airport.

1460
01:37:49,239 --> 01:37:53,300
Many phone calls are coming,
but Devan answers "Hmm".

1461
01:37:56,980 --> 01:37:59,249
I'm getting scared watching
the time passing.

1462
01:37:59,249 --> 01:38:03,187
When you leave in disguise that African
S.P. will immediately inform Punnekkadan.

1463
01:38:03,187 --> 01:38:04,347
What is the solution?

1464
01:38:10,494 --> 01:38:14,731
Government's irresponsibility is the reason
for this condition of the road - High court.

1465
01:38:14,731 --> 01:38:17,167
Isn't it enough for the High court & the government?

1466
01:38:17,167 --> 01:38:20,537
Child died, when scooter
collided with the gutter.

1467
01:38:20,537 --> 01:38:23,474
Such a disguising government...

1468
01:38:23,474 --> 01:38:25,609
If the scooter collides with the gutter,
what could the government do?

1469
01:38:25,609 --> 01:38:28,479
The safety of the people is the
responsibility of the government.

1470
01:38:28,479 --> 01:38:31,782
Keeping the country & the road well is the
responsibility of the police & government.

1471
01:38:31,782 --> 01:38:34,184
The new P.W.D. Minister will be
welcomed in his native place.

1472
01:38:34,184 --> 01:38:35,486
Then, he will be in that house.

1473
01:38:35,486 --> 01:38:36,520
Call him, brother.

1474
01:38:36,520 --> 01:38:37,721
I'll be satisfied only,
if I reprimand him.

1475
01:38:37,721 --> 01:38:40,891
Would a Minister, who has seen the assembly
is going to be scared by your scolding?

1476
01:38:40,891 --> 01:38:43,052
This is going to be a job
to the police.

1477
01:38:45,696 --> 01:38:46,463
Who is that?

1478
01:38:46,463 --> 01:38:47,731
Give it to the Minister.

1479
01:38:47,731 --> 01:38:49,433
Minister is sleeping.

1480
01:38:49,433 --> 01:38:54,538
Sleeping? When the country is in this
condition, is he sleeping taking drinks?

1481
01:38:54,538 --> 01:38:57,174
Not that. Minister is taking
his afternoon nap.

1482
01:38:57,174 --> 01:38:58,509
Then what?

1483
01:38:58,509 --> 01:38:59,443
Kick him & wake him.

1484
01:38:59,443 --> 01:39:00,477
Who are you to say that?

1485
01:39:00,477 --> 01:39:01,979
Me? I'm public.

1486
01:39:01,979 --> 01:39:03,280
Who is that?

1487
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:04,838
A public is talking.

1488
01:39:06,517 --> 01:39:08,952
Minister Mathaichan, who is that?

1489
01:39:08,952 --> 01:39:12,756
You are the government the public
appointed with expectations.

1490
01:39:12,756 --> 01:39:13,857
So what?

1491
01:39:13,857 --> 01:39:16,426
Are these roads are roads
or ditches?

1492
01:39:16,426 --> 01:39:20,931
To study the roads I traveled from
Trivandrum to Kasarcode by train.

1493
01:39:20,931 --> 01:39:21,999
No problem at all.

1494
01:39:21,999 --> 01:39:25,502
If there is a problem on the roads,
go by train. No problem.

1495
01:39:25,502 --> 01:39:26,904
Then, what is the problem?

1496
01:39:26,904 --> 01:39:29,006
Can't you see the price of
rice reaching sky high?

1497
01:39:29,006 --> 01:39:30,574
"Aravana".

1498
01:39:30,574 --> 01:39:31,975
Is there enough "Aravana"
for the devotees?

1499
01:39:31,975 --> 01:39:34,945
Rice & "Aravana" do not
belong to my portfolio.

1500
01:39:34,945 --> 01:39:37,114
Anyway I'll tell you
our party's decision.

1501
01:39:37,114 --> 01:39:40,350
People must get used to milk
& egg instead of rice & "Aravana".

1502
01:39:40,350 --> 01:39:43,220
A cow & a hen
at everybody's home.

1503
01:39:43,220 --> 01:39:46,156
We must create
a healthy generation.

1504
01:39:46,156 --> 01:39:49,693
Then there was a lizard in the
"Aravana" that matter has ended now.

1505
01:39:49,693 --> 01:39:52,162
Now the devotees are standing in a big queue
& get "Aravana" with difficulty.

1506
01:39:52,162 --> 01:39:53,964
Do you know, what should be
done to people like you?

1507
01:39:53,964 --> 01:39:57,334
Rubbing chilies in your nose
& whip you making you kneeling...

1508
01:39:57,334 --> 01:40:01,338
Crucify you after stamping you
& bury you in a ditch on the road.

1509
01:40:01,338 --> 01:40:04,141
Hey... You scoundrel...

1510
01:40:04,141 --> 01:40:07,211
You punk... Do you know
to whom you are talking?

1511
01:40:07,211 --> 01:40:08,212
To the Minister.

1512
01:40:08,212 --> 01:40:12,983
If you talk one more word, police will do
all that you said at free of cost.

1513
01:40:12,983 --> 01:40:15,508
Then, add this also
& inform the police.

1514
01:40:25,696 --> 01:40:27,425
Was he in police
department before?

1515
01:40:28,165 --> 01:40:30,633
What a disgusting language?

1516
01:40:31,435 --> 01:40:35,038
My life's ambition is
to scold a Minister.

1517
01:40:35,038 --> 01:40:37,040
I did it & I'm happy now.

1518
01:40:37,040 --> 01:40:39,943
Hey P.A.! Find out his number
& inform the police...

1519
01:40:39,943 --> 01:40:44,314
Bring the person who scolded me
to the police custody immediately.

1520
01:40:44,314 --> 01:40:45,713
Hey! Go & tell.

1521
01:40:51,355 --> 01:40:52,689
Open the dickey.

1522
01:40:52,689 --> 01:40:54,691
Load that box in there.

1523
01:40:54,691 --> 01:40:57,489
There are breakable
things are in this.

1524
01:41:04,101 --> 01:41:09,206
They have kept the luggage
in KL-7 BF-2007, white Innova car.

1525
01:41:09,206 --> 01:41:10,833
They are going by that car.

1526
01:41:38,568 --> 01:41:39,036
Why?

1527
01:41:39,036 --> 01:41:40,837
For scolding
the Minister over phone.

1528
01:41:40,837 --> 01:41:44,408
Not even closed your mouth after scolding
the Minister, before that police entry.

1529
01:41:44,408 --> 01:41:45,609
That is police.

1530
01:41:45,609 --> 01:41:50,180
He is the one who scolded the Minister
more than this man. Arrest him first.

1531
01:41:50,180 --> 01:41:52,282
Who are you to order me?

1532
01:41:52,282 --> 01:41:53,450
I'm a senior...

1533
01:41:53,450 --> 01:41:54,917
Cook...

1534
01:41:55,886 --> 01:41:58,616
Cook must remain as a cook.
Understand?

1535
01:42:02,192 --> 01:42:03,260
Come...

1536
01:42:03,260 --> 01:42:04,488
Forgive him once.

1537
01:42:05,629 --> 01:42:06,618
Come...

1538
01:42:16,406 --> 01:42:21,400
Crazy... Without recognizing me,
he had beaten me.

1539
01:42:22,846 --> 01:42:26,650
You are under police custody,
for scolding the Minister,

1540
01:42:26,650 --> 01:42:28,845
S.P. Indhuchudan is
a witness for that.

1541
01:42:29,553 --> 01:42:31,221
The prosecution can't say...

1542
01:42:31,221 --> 01:42:34,520
that a man who is under police
custody has committed a murder.

1543
01:42:35,792 --> 01:42:37,160
I've forgotten one thing.

1544
01:42:37,160 --> 01:42:37,994
Here...

1545
01:42:37,994 --> 01:42:41,565
I've investigated about the girl
& her family, you mentioned.

1546
01:42:41,565 --> 01:42:43,829
The details collected from
the Bangalore police.

1547
01:42:44,901 --> 01:42:48,837
Since there was no any complaint from
the side of the girl, the file was closed.

1548
01:43:02,786 --> 01:43:03,587
Yes.

1549
01:43:03,587 --> 01:43:04,952
He is the brother of the girl.

1550
01:43:08,091 --> 01:43:09,159
They are ready to go.

1551
01:43:09,159 --> 01:43:10,794
D.I.G. & S.P. have come.

1552
01:43:10,794 --> 01:43:12,262
They say that this
Delhi journey is a risky one.

1553
01:43:12,262 --> 01:43:13,363
Can't you cancel it?

1554
01:43:13,363 --> 01:43:14,631
I've to go today.

1555
01:43:14,631 --> 01:43:17,234
If the police feel that we need protection,
let them come as escorts.

1556
01:43:17,234 --> 01:43:18,394
Mahendra...

1557
01:43:21,238 --> 01:43:22,906
There is nothing to fear now.

1558
01:43:22,906 --> 01:43:27,144
C.I. Jayachandran has arrested Devan
for scolding the Minister 10 minutes before.

1559
01:43:27,144 --> 01:43:29,045
C.I. Jayachandran?
Yes.

1560
01:43:29,045 --> 01:43:30,239
There is something
wrong in this.

1561
01:43:33,884 --> 01:43:34,818
Stop...

1562
01:43:34,818 --> 01:43:37,120
Cancel your Delhi journey.

1563
01:43:37,120 --> 01:43:38,144
What are you saying?

1564
01:43:38,622 --> 01:43:40,988
Don't say anything.
Listen only to what I say.

1565
01:43:43,627 --> 01:43:44,795
What are you going to do?

1566
01:43:44,795 --> 01:43:48,131
Instead of Ganeshan & Mahendran,
I'll go in this vehicle.

1567
01:43:48,131 --> 01:43:50,333
If my guess is right,
he will attack me.

1568
01:43:50,333 --> 01:43:51,401
At airport road.

1569
01:43:51,401 --> 01:43:53,336
At that moment,
I'll arrest him.

1570
01:43:53,336 --> 01:43:54,564
Antony! That is risky.

1571
01:43:55,906 --> 01:43:58,306
It could be a gun or
a bomb or an accident.

1572
01:44:04,214 --> 01:44:05,374
Take this vehicle.

1573
01:44:19,196 --> 01:44:21,687
Why are you catching me?
Who are you?

1574
01:44:29,706 --> 01:44:30,807
I must thank you.

1575
01:44:30,807 --> 01:44:32,476
The uniform that
I'm wearing now...

1576
01:44:32,476 --> 01:44:37,573
My family & my life, whatever
I do to help, I can't repay.

1577
01:44:38,281 --> 01:44:41,818
As the jeep has broken down,
it has been delayed to go to the station.

1578
01:44:41,818 --> 01:44:43,649
I'll wait here, you go.

1579
01:44:48,258 --> 01:44:52,262
Devji! S.P. Antony Punnekkadan is
in the car that is going to the airport.

1580
01:44:52,262 --> 01:44:55,493
Mahendran & Ganeshan are in
Flat no. 3B in Sea Lake flat.

1581
01:45:56,493 --> 01:45:57,727
You didn't expect me
here, right?

1582
01:45:57,727 --> 01:45:59,563
- No.

1583
01:45:59,563 --> 01:46:02,299
But I wanted to see you.

1584
01:46:02,299 --> 01:46:03,533
See...

1585
01:46:03,533 --> 01:46:05,268
See to the full of your eyes.

1586
01:46:05,268 --> 01:46:07,771
I was not aware who you are.

1587
01:46:07,771 --> 01:46:10,273
You do not know who
I am even now.

1588
01:46:10,273 --> 01:46:14,144
To inform you that I trapped your
informer Jose & made you come here.

1589
01:46:14,144 --> 01:46:18,748
Taking the Venom by the bitten
snake is not in my tradition.

1590
01:46:18,748 --> 01:46:20,116
We are not snake tamers.

1591
01:46:20,116 --> 01:46:23,853
But I can't sleep in peace

1592
01:46:23,853 --> 01:46:27,624
...without plucking the teeth of
a snake knowing that it would strike.

1593
01:46:27,624 --> 01:46:29,558
It has been a long time
since I slept.

1594
01:46:36,132 --> 01:46:38,602
Simply a precaution.

1595
01:46:38,602 --> 01:46:41,271
He is holding the original
& the duplicate key of this flat.

1596
01:46:41,271 --> 01:46:43,406
You can go out only,
when I decide.

1597
01:46:43,406 --> 01:46:47,577
Ramesh! I'm not a person
as you think, listen to me.

1598
01:46:47,577 --> 01:46:50,647
Once I listened to you,
trusted you & experienced.

1599
01:46:50,647 --> 01:46:52,849
A man who trusts a person
more than once is an idiot.

1600
01:46:52,849 --> 01:46:54,017
I'm not that.

1601
01:46:54,017 --> 01:46:56,386
Ok! You need not listen
to what I say.

1602
01:46:56,386 --> 01:46:57,587
But I have to go.

1603
01:46:57,587 --> 01:46:58,922
I didn't say that
I won't allow you.

1604
01:46:58,922 --> 01:47:02,826
But it'll be after the flight of Mahendran
& Ganeshan flies over this flat.

1605
01:47:02,826 --> 01:47:04,293
In that case,
they won't go in that flight.

1606
01:48:08,758 --> 01:48:12,829
When you used your Northern
Kalari talent, I was a little hurt.

1607
01:48:12,829 --> 01:48:14,626
But I'm happy now.

1608
01:48:17,667 --> 01:48:18,601
Death sentence.

1609
01:48:18,601 --> 01:48:20,503
Nothing will prevent me...

1610
01:48:20,503 --> 01:48:24,269
...from throwing you inside for entering
into my flat & trying to kill me.

1611
01:48:29,813 --> 01:48:31,178
This is Ramesh Nambiyar.

1612
01:48:32,048 --> 01:48:32,982
Tell me.

1613
01:48:32,982 --> 01:48:36,152
We can prove that it is Devan
who kills informing in advance.

1614
01:48:36,152 --> 01:48:38,254
He is under my custody
at Sea Lake flat.

1615
01:48:38,254 --> 01:48:40,256
Let us forget
our personal problem.

1616
01:48:40,256 --> 01:48:41,324
You must come here.

1617
01:48:41,324 --> 01:48:44,350
This is the time to prove that
what you did was right.

1618
01:49:28,104 --> 01:49:29,435
Who is that?

1619
01:49:34,711 --> 01:49:37,213
I've not taken
the duplicate key.

1620
01:49:37,213 --> 01:49:39,015
Leave me.

1621
01:49:39,015 --> 01:49:40,573
I'll tell...

1622
01:49:43,820 --> 01:49:44,821
What Ramu?

1623
01:49:44,821 --> 01:49:46,812
This is not Ramu, advocate.
Devan.

1624
01:49:50,894 --> 01:49:51,883
I'm not in that room.

1625
01:49:52,529 --> 01:49:54,764
I am here...
Near the swimming pool.

1626
01:49:54,764 --> 01:49:58,368
I was the headmaster at the school
where you learned your tricks.

1627
01:49:58,368 --> 01:50:01,304
You said that
you didn't sleep for sometime.

1628
01:50:01,304 --> 01:50:02,931
Sleep comfortably.

1629
01:50:03,473 --> 01:50:07,273
Don't jump in the swimming pool
from there, I've opened the valves.

1630
01:50:08,645 --> 01:50:13,742
See this. I'll decide, when
you should come out of the flat.

1631
01:50:43,179 --> 01:50:44,681
This is my flat.

1632
01:50:44,681 --> 01:50:46,449
They are my securities.

1633
01:50:46,449 --> 01:50:50,186
You don't have any device
to control me, Dinesha!

1634
01:50:50,186 --> 01:50:54,157
I'll decide when you should
go from this compound.

1635
01:50:54,157 --> 01:50:55,181
Understand?

1636
01:51:07,036 --> 01:51:07,934
Open...

1637
01:52:15,271 --> 01:52:19,409
When the advocate said, that the person
who wanted to kill us is coming to this flat...

1638
01:52:19,409 --> 01:52:22,401
We were so curious
to see the person in person.

1639
01:52:22,745 --> 01:52:26,916
When he said the accused has come
from Mangalapuram, I couldn't understand.

1640
01:52:26,916 --> 01:52:28,751
What kind of
calculation is this?

1641
01:52:28,751 --> 01:52:31,321
Ganesha!
This is Bangalore connection.

1642
01:52:31,321 --> 01:52:35,224
There are only 10 minutes
for your punishment.

1643
01:52:35,224 --> 01:52:36,759
What can you do now?

1644
01:52:36,759 --> 01:52:39,922
Want to kill us? Kill...

1645
01:53:46,729 --> 01:53:49,432
Law has its own way.
Shall I go?

1646
01:53:49,432 --> 01:53:56,773
Advocate! You are going to feel
sorry for aborting my plan.

1647
01:53:56,773 --> 01:53:57,637
Keep it in your mind.

1648
01:54:22,765 --> 01:54:25,700
He is the man who kidnapped
Dr. Viinoth Baskar from the court on that day.

1649
01:54:43,820 --> 01:54:47,483
Tell me, who told you
to kidnap Dr. Vinoth Baskar?

1650
01:54:47,757 --> 01:54:48,558
That...

1651
01:54:48,558 --> 01:54:49,325
Tell me...

1652
01:54:49,325 --> 01:54:53,284
Don't beat me anymore sir,
I'll die...

1653
01:54:54,430 --> 01:54:55,998
Where did you hide him?

1654
01:54:55,998 --> 01:54:57,366
That...

1655
01:54:57,366 --> 01:54:58,034
Tell me...

1656
01:54:58,034 --> 01:54:59,068
That...

1657
01:54:59,068 --> 01:55:00,501
I'll kill you...

1658
01:55:06,776 --> 01:55:08,038
Is the advocate available?

1659
01:55:14,217 --> 01:55:15,582
Bring him some coffee...

1660
01:55:16,619 --> 01:55:20,056
Your sister who was studying in
Bangalore was met with an accident...

1661
01:55:20,056 --> 01:55:26,028
& when you came there, I heard that you
took Arun Kumar under bail at that time.

1662
01:55:26,028 --> 01:55:27,230
Yes... why?

1663
01:55:27,230 --> 01:55:31,132
What was the accident
happened to your sister?

1664
01:55:38,141 --> 01:55:43,880
What was the reason for your leaving
the place without giving even a complaint?

1665
01:55:43,880 --> 01:55:46,082
It is not necessary to tell you.

1666
01:55:46,082 --> 01:55:48,985
Not necessary, but you must know
what had happened?

1667
01:55:48,985 --> 01:55:52,580
You must know for
your own conscience...

1668
01:55:53,890 --> 01:55:54,754
Harish...

1669
01:56:03,199 --> 01:56:05,735
Perhaps you would remember,
when his name is mentioned...

1670
01:56:05,735 --> 01:56:08,169
Vinoth... Dr. Viinoth Baskar.

1671
01:56:11,374 --> 01:56:14,777
He was the Lecturer at the college,
in which your sister was studying.

1672
01:56:14,777 --> 01:56:17,914
He is the main eye witness of the
murder occurred at Bangalore.

1673
01:56:17,914 --> 01:56:22,908
Because of Dr. Viinoth's approach
we were able to investigate that case.

1674
01:56:23,753 --> 01:56:27,456
This poor man was locked up in a cell of
a mental hospital at the border of Kerala,

1675
01:56:27,456 --> 01:56:29,592
where anybody could be
admitted if paid well...

1676
01:56:29,592 --> 01:56:32,028
A rogue named Thiruvambadi
Madhavan did it...

1677
01:56:32,028 --> 01:56:37,099
When I saw him, he wanted only
to know about your sister Ashwadhi...

1678
01:56:37,099 --> 01:56:39,335
That investigation only brought
me to your house.

1679
01:56:39,335 --> 01:56:44,240
I didn't know that you were Ashwadhi's brother
who came to argue for Arun Kumar...

1680
01:56:44,240 --> 01:56:46,809
How is Ashwadhi linked
with Arun Kumar's murder?

1681
01:56:46,809 --> 01:56:50,813
Before knowing about Ashwadhi,
you must know about Karthik...

1682
01:56:50,813 --> 01:56:53,916
You should know about Devan,
Karthik's brother...

1683
01:56:53,916 --> 01:56:55,284
Devan?

1684
01:56:55,284 --> 01:56:56,052
Yes.

1685
01:56:56,052 --> 01:56:58,554
Devan may be your enemy.

1686
01:56:58,554 --> 01:57:01,657
Because you don't know
anything about Devan.

1687
01:57:01,657 --> 01:57:05,328
We were childhood friends...

1688
01:57:05,328 --> 01:57:11,500
Karthik was his only kin after
his father & mother died.

1689
01:57:11,500 --> 01:57:15,304
To talk about him,
nothing would stop him.

1690
01:57:15,304 --> 01:57:18,068
Devan's ambition is
to make him a doctor...

1691
01:57:19,041 --> 01:57:20,599
But... he...

1692
01:57:36,225 --> 01:57:37,351
You've done it...

1693
01:57:40,796 --> 01:57:43,699
Look Sanu, if my brother sees our
friendship, he would be shocked?

1694
01:57:43,699 --> 01:57:46,369
That was his dream...

1695
01:57:46,369 --> 01:57:49,338
But he was not ready
to work for that...

1696
01:57:49,338 --> 01:57:51,474
He had a wavering mind
& he was lazy.

1697
01:57:51,474 --> 01:57:57,113
He wanted to be with
his brother always.

1698
01:57:57,113 --> 01:57:59,982
Finally with his influence
& donation,

1699
01:57:59,982 --> 01:58:05,354
Devan got admission for him in the Bangalore
medical college where I was teaching...

1700
01:58:05,354 --> 01:58:08,291
Don't tell me...
Don't tell me that alone...

1701
01:58:08,291 --> 01:58:11,661
It was not my mistake for sending me
out from Manipal Medical College

1702
01:58:11,661 --> 01:58:13,229
& Mysore Medical college...

1703
01:58:13,229 --> 01:58:17,867
The principals of those colleges
couldn't cope up with my principles...

1704
01:58:17,867 --> 01:58:19,068
Brother...

1705
01:58:19,068 --> 01:58:21,570
Have to attend the class
at the time, they say.

1706
01:58:21,570 --> 01:58:23,906
Must study & write the exam.

1707
01:58:23,906 --> 01:58:26,042
Don't forget that
we are paying the money.

1708
01:58:26,042 --> 01:58:28,374
What is this?
A cucumber shanty...

1709
01:58:28,844 --> 01:58:30,846
What we need is freedom...

1710
01:58:30,846 --> 01:58:36,552
In 1947, our Mahatma Gandhiji got us
freedom with great difficulty...

1711
01:58:36,552 --> 01:58:39,588
He ate salt, drank water,
walked "Thendi"...

1712
01:58:39,588 --> 01:58:41,891
He is talking about salt agitation
& Thandi journey...

1713
01:58:41,891 --> 01:58:45,628
Our late father's ambition was
to make me a doctor...

1714
01:58:45,628 --> 01:58:48,264
I left it for bring you up
& to make you study...

1715
01:58:48,264 --> 01:58:50,333
I am seeing myself in you...

1716
01:58:50,333 --> 01:58:52,668
It's my dream
to make you a doctor.

1717
01:58:52,668 --> 01:58:54,070
I too have dreams...

1718
01:58:54,070 --> 01:58:55,871
Don't you know
about my dreams?

1719
01:58:55,871 --> 01:58:58,567
Is it your dream to fix your still in
the places of the heads of the players?

1720
01:59:01,877 --> 01:59:05,014
He doesn't have the patience
to become a doctor...

1721
01:59:05,014 --> 01:59:07,683
He will get patients only
after he becomes a doctor...

1722
01:59:07,683 --> 01:59:10,920
It is not patients, patience...

1723
01:59:10,920 --> 01:59:14,623
If you try, he will become what we want,
because he is scared of you.

1724
01:59:14,623 --> 01:59:16,826
Yes... scared...
I am scared of him...

1725
01:59:16,826 --> 01:59:18,794
By the way, you must tell
him something...

1726
01:59:18,794 --> 01:59:21,797
When he comes here,
he shouldn't call me "Pakara"...

1727
01:59:21,797 --> 01:59:23,232
He won't call like that...
I am sure...

1728
01:59:23,232 --> 01:59:27,336
You should watch him
all the time...

1729
01:59:27,336 --> 01:59:29,939
Then, who will offer me eyes
for my work?

1730
01:59:29,939 --> 01:59:33,743
Pakara, my pain... You...

1731
01:59:33,743 --> 01:59:37,680
Deva! you've told
this 1000 times to me...

1732
01:59:37,680 --> 01:59:42,318
You send him here; I'll make him a doctor
& send him there, is it enough?

1733
01:59:42,318 --> 01:59:44,047
Enough...

1734
01:59:50,426 --> 01:59:52,587
My brother is a chick...

1735
01:59:54,897 --> 01:59:57,900
That's it; you all should take
care of my brother...

1736
01:59:57,900 --> 01:59:59,235
...as if a mother hen takes
care of its chicks...

1737
01:59:59,235 --> 02:00:02,071
You should fulfill the gap
of my absence...

1738
02:00:02,071 --> 02:00:08,177
It'll be an irritation in my heart till
he is married to a girl...

1739
02:00:08,177 --> 02:00:10,079
Start before
the bad time starts...

1740
02:00:10,079 --> 02:00:10,980
Come here...

1741
02:00:10,980 --> 02:00:14,517
Shankar brother,
I believe only you...

1742
02:00:14,517 --> 02:00:17,052
I know son, I'll take care of
all the matters of your brother...

1743
02:00:17,052 --> 02:00:17,787
That's ok...

1744
02:00:17,787 --> 02:00:21,557
Send me my pocket money on the
first of every month without fail...

1745
02:00:21,557 --> 02:00:22,992
If you delay,
I would be starving...

1746
02:00:22,992 --> 02:00:24,293
Go quickly...

1747
02:00:24,293 --> 02:00:25,027
Brother...

1748
02:00:25,027 --> 02:00:27,763
You must have your food
in time & sleep well...

1749
02:00:27,763 --> 02:00:30,399
I'll do it... You study well...

1750
02:00:30,399 --> 02:00:31,967
I shall go...

1751
02:00:31,967 --> 02:00:33,402
Shall I come with you
to Bangalore?

1752
02:00:33,402 --> 02:00:37,373
I see tears in your eyes...

1753
02:00:37,373 --> 02:00:38,674
I am not crying...

1754
02:00:38,674 --> 02:00:40,543
You are crying...
I see tears in your eyes...

1755
02:00:40,543 --> 02:00:42,645
What is this like a child?

1756
02:00:42,645 --> 02:00:44,013
I'll come back in 2 days...

1757
02:00:44,013 --> 02:00:44,480
What?

1758
02:00:44,480 --> 02:00:45,915
I'll come in 2 days...

1759
02:00:45,915 --> 02:00:47,216
Get in...

1760
02:00:47,216 --> 02:00:48,376
What is this like loading
a rice bag?

1761
02:00:53,255 --> 02:00:55,382
Go carefully;
it is like kidnapping me...

1762
02:00:55,524 --> 02:00:56,957
Brother, bye...

1763
02:01:04,533 --> 02:01:08,704
Like a nice resort.
A place to enjoy...

1764
02:01:08,704 --> 02:01:11,195
You may go...

1765
02:01:15,644 --> 02:01:16,872
I have wasted one "Hai"...

1766
02:01:22,918 --> 02:01:23,976
"Pakara"...

1767
02:01:32,595 --> 02:01:33,963
What?

1768
02:01:33,963 --> 02:01:34,861
You...

1769
02:01:35,965 --> 02:01:39,068
Is it you who named me
"Pakara"?

1770
02:01:39,068 --> 02:01:41,537
I am your lecturer here...

1771
02:01:41,537 --> 02:01:43,439
You must call me
with respect...

1772
02:01:43,439 --> 02:01:43,939
How?

1773
02:01:43,939 --> 02:01:44,840
"Sir".

1774
02:01:44,840 --> 02:01:47,900
You want me
to call you "sir"...

1775
02:01:49,111 --> 02:01:51,647
A good joke...
Come here...

1776
02:01:51,647 --> 02:01:53,349
Why there are
so many policemen?

1777
02:01:53,349 --> 02:01:55,484
Is this a medical college or
a police training college?

1778
02:01:55,484 --> 02:01:56,485
You don't know the matter?

1779
02:01:56,485 --> 02:01:58,754
A girl has committed suicide
in the ladies hostel yesterday...

1780
02:01:58,754 --> 02:02:02,458
Her room-mate Ashwadhi Nambiyar's
statement was, it was a murder...

1781
02:02:02,458 --> 02:02:05,661
They already caught the murderer;
the police are collecting the evidences...

1782
02:02:05,661 --> 02:02:06,729
The suspect is a student
of this college...

1783
02:02:06,729 --> 02:02:08,754
...A Malayali... Arun Kumar...

1784
02:02:14,069 --> 02:02:17,527
Because of him the students are boycotting
the college for the past 2 days...

1785
02:02:18,607 --> 02:02:21,201
This is the good atmosphere
which suits my taste...

1786
02:02:34,657 --> 02:02:36,725
What are you looking at?

1787
02:02:36,725 --> 02:02:38,093
Did you see that girl?

1788
02:02:38,093 --> 02:02:39,695
Which girl?

1789
02:02:39,695 --> 02:02:40,629
That girl...

1790
02:02:40,629 --> 02:02:41,721
On the right or left?

1791
02:02:46,168 --> 02:02:47,570
I'll tell this to your brother...

1792
02:02:47,570 --> 02:02:49,071
Hey! She won't be suitable
to my brother...

1793
02:02:49,071 --> 02:02:50,539
She suits me exactly...

1794
02:02:50,539 --> 02:02:52,575
It's not so easy, my son...

1795
02:02:52,575 --> 02:02:53,475
She is a girl...

1796
02:02:53,475 --> 02:02:55,811
She is a girl, but her
activities are like a man.

1797
02:02:55,811 --> 02:02:59,247
She is representing the beauty contest
to be conducted in this college...

1798
02:03:00,816 --> 02:03:02,340
I like her...

1799
02:03:19,969 --> 02:03:21,337
You don't worry...

1800
02:03:21,337 --> 02:03:22,972
Mahendran & the advocate
are at the court.

1801
02:03:22,972 --> 02:03:23,939
He'll get you the bail...

1802
02:03:29,511 --> 02:03:31,570
I don't want this
arrogant sorry.

1803
02:03:34,016 --> 02:03:35,317
Stop...

1804
02:03:35,317 --> 02:03:37,219
I am Ganeshan,
well known to Arun...

1805
02:03:37,219 --> 02:03:41,357
Study, become a doctor, get married
& have children & look after your family,

1806
02:03:41,357 --> 02:03:43,158
...instead why are you interfering
in unnecessary matters?

1807
02:03:43,158 --> 02:03:44,591
Why are you giving
unwanted statements?

1808
02:03:46,028 --> 02:03:47,930
Child! Enough
of talking likes this...

1809
02:03:47,930 --> 02:03:50,132
I'll forgive you as you did it
out of ignorance...

1810
02:03:50,132 --> 02:03:55,866
But, if you say anything in the court,
I'll cut off your tongue, understand?

1811
02:03:58,407 --> 02:04:00,807
Leave me, it is a chance
given by God...

1812
02:04:03,312 --> 02:04:05,047
Brother, what is the problem?

1813
02:04:05,047 --> 02:04:06,749
Who are you to ask that?

1814
02:04:06,749 --> 02:04:08,017
I am her husband.

1815
02:04:08,017 --> 02:04:09,885
But I don't have that right now...

1816
02:04:09,885 --> 02:04:11,754
...Because I didn't
marry that girl...

1817
02:04:11,754 --> 02:04:13,055
Still I have to interfere...

1818
02:04:13,055 --> 02:04:16,225
...because I may marry
her in future...

1819
02:04:16,225 --> 02:04:17,660
...lf not, she will
ask me questions...

1820
02:04:17,660 --> 02:04:19,862
Are you a human being?

1821
02:04:19,862 --> 02:04:24,833
You were quiet, when a rogue
was threatening me...

1822
02:04:24,833 --> 02:04:27,670
To avoid all those questions,
I am interfering now...

1823
02:04:27,670 --> 02:04:31,807
You can't do any harm
to that girl ever...

1824
02:04:31,807 --> 02:04:34,209
We'll have to meet again...

1825
02:04:34,209 --> 02:04:37,079
While coming, bring
your bed & suitcase...

1826
02:04:37,079 --> 02:04:38,881
How was my petty dialogue?

1827
02:04:38,881 --> 02:04:39,682
I can't understand...

1828
02:04:39,682 --> 02:04:41,183
What I meant was a coffin...

1829
02:04:41,183 --> 02:04:42,384
...To put his body in it & send it
to his house...

1830
02:04:42,384 --> 02:04:44,286
Who is he, a coffin seller?

1831
02:04:44,286 --> 02:04:45,621
No... a new admission.

1832
02:04:45,621 --> 02:04:47,923
Let's introduce ourselves...

1833
02:04:47,923 --> 02:04:48,857
What is your name?

1834
02:04:48,857 --> 02:04:49,792
"Guava fruit".

1835
02:04:49,792 --> 02:04:52,556
My name is bat... I'll...

1836
02:04:54,763 --> 02:04:56,098
Don't come here...

1837
02:04:56,098 --> 02:04:57,497
Don't do anything to her...

1838
02:04:58,367 --> 02:05:00,130
I got what I wanted...

1839
02:05:03,605 --> 02:05:06,130
It hurts a little...

1840
02:05:06,809 --> 02:05:08,911
Pakara! What is this?

1841
02:05:08,911 --> 02:05:11,004
It was I, who got the beating,
why are you crying?

1842
02:05:12,614 --> 02:05:15,651
I haven't laughed like
this in my life time...

1843
02:05:15,651 --> 02:05:17,186
To laugh on seeing
others suffer...

1844
02:05:17,186 --> 02:05:20,022
Now your face has
become like a bat's...

1845
02:05:20,022 --> 02:05:22,624
What a sound of the slap?

1846
02:05:22,624 --> 02:05:23,926
It's not the sound of the slap...

1847
02:05:23,926 --> 02:05:27,262
It was the sound of the
romance between us.

1848
02:05:27,262 --> 02:05:30,332
You see, if played with me
not only she...

1849
02:05:30,332 --> 02:05:37,072
...but also her friend will fall in love
& reach the sky, then fall in the ditch...

1850
02:05:37,072 --> 02:05:40,166
...I'll laugh like a love mad person
with my victory...

1851
02:05:41,243 --> 02:05:43,245
You can talk anything
about Ashwadhi Nambiar...

1852
02:05:43,245 --> 02:05:45,414
...But don't talk anything
about her friend...

1853
02:05:45,414 --> 02:05:45,848
If I talk?

1854
02:05:45,848 --> 02:05:47,015
She belongs to
a reputed family...

1855
02:05:47,015 --> 02:05:47,449
So...

1856
02:05:47,449 --> 02:05:48,717
Somebody is already
having his eye on her.

1857
02:05:48,717 --> 02:05:49,818
Are those the eyes she has?

1858
02:05:49,818 --> 02:05:52,082
Not that. A doctor is looking
her to marry her...

1859
02:05:57,726 --> 02:06:01,430
It is very cheap for a lecturer
to love a student...

1860
02:06:01,430 --> 02:06:02,454
Don't tell anyone...

1861
02:06:03,966 --> 02:06:05,634
You have to give
me full support.

1862
02:06:05,634 --> 02:06:06,468
How?

1863
02:06:06,468 --> 02:06:08,737
I love Ashwadhi Nambiar...

1864
02:06:08,737 --> 02:06:10,038
It is not enough
what you got now?

1865
02:06:10,038 --> 02:06:15,772
I am going to conduct a match between me
& Ashwadhi Nambiar... A 20/20...

1866
02:06:19,248 --> 02:06:22,718
Karthik...
He always impressed me.

1867
02:06:22,718 --> 02:06:24,019
I don't know, how?

1868
02:06:24,019 --> 02:06:28,090
He was the winner of
the match as he said...

1869
02:06:28,090 --> 02:06:30,923
Finally they became
unseperatable...

1870
02:10:54,523 --> 02:10:57,192
Karthik will stay here
on his holidays.

1871
02:10:57,192 --> 02:11:00,295
His only weakness is
Kerala style food...

1872
02:11:00,295 --> 02:11:02,798
Do you know how much he has changed
after coming to my control?

1873
02:11:02,798 --> 02:11:04,595
He is not naughty now,
he studies well...

1874
02:11:09,638 --> 02:11:12,374
He doesn't even see
a girl face to face...

1875
02:11:12,374 --> 02:11:13,341
What a change?

1876
02:11:13,341 --> 02:11:14,276
What a change?

1877
02:11:14,276 --> 02:11:15,677
What a change, right?

1878
02:11:15,677 --> 02:11:17,112
Look there...

1879
02:11:17,112 --> 02:11:18,238
Someone like him...

1880
02:11:19,681 --> 02:11:21,750
Yes, he is like him...

1881
02:11:21,750 --> 02:11:24,252
They say there are 7 persons
alike in this world...

1882
02:11:24,252 --> 02:11:25,220
Why should
we see all these?

1883
02:11:25,220 --> 02:11:26,847
Why should we see
all these, right?

1884
02:11:37,566 --> 02:11:39,501
It's me, where are you now?

1885
02:11:39,501 --> 02:11:42,137
Brother, I am now in the lab...

1886
02:11:42,137 --> 02:11:43,538
In the lab?

1887
02:11:43,538 --> 02:11:46,508
I am now reading
the anatomy of a body...

1888
02:11:46,508 --> 02:11:48,009
Don't you believe me?

1889
02:11:48,009 --> 02:11:49,840
Pakara is with me.

1890
02:11:51,313 --> 02:11:52,414
Shall I give?

1891
02:11:52,414 --> 02:11:54,749
No, I'll give separately
to Pakara...

1892
02:11:54,749 --> 02:11:57,686
Brother!
My exams are nearing...

1893
02:11:57,686 --> 02:12:01,256
Don't call me often,
because I'll lose my concentration...

1894
02:12:01,256 --> 02:12:02,450
Shall I disconnect?

1895
02:12:09,464 --> 02:12:10,398
He is innocent...

1896
02:12:10,398 --> 02:12:12,968
Even God won't bear my lie...

1897
02:12:12,968 --> 02:12:16,938
I am his life & he trusts me...

1898
02:12:16,938 --> 02:12:18,140
Who is this foolish brother?

1899
02:12:18,140 --> 02:12:20,631
Don't...
Don't play with my brother...

1900
02:12:26,081 --> 02:12:27,514
Who is this?

1901
02:12:30,085 --> 02:12:32,212
Where are you looking
while driving?

1902
02:12:32,654 --> 02:12:34,122
Doesn't he have eyes?

1903
02:12:34,122 --> 02:12:36,420
If we didn't apply brake,
what would have happened to us?

1904
02:12:37,926 --> 02:12:40,629
Are you threatening us?

1905
02:12:40,629 --> 02:12:42,494
I'll slap you...

1906
02:12:43,899 --> 02:12:45,033
Who are you girl?

1907
02:12:45,033 --> 02:12:46,968
Why do you need my
address & my horoscope?

1908
02:12:46,968 --> 02:12:48,036
Is this the boy...?

1909
02:12:48,036 --> 02:12:49,437
He is my man who is
going to marry me...

1910
02:12:49,437 --> 02:12:50,597
What is bothering you?

1911
02:12:51,606 --> 02:12:52,574
Can't simply leave this.

1912
02:12:52,574 --> 02:12:53,508
He is...

1913
02:12:53,508 --> 02:12:56,378
That's right,
is he your driver?

1914
02:12:56,378 --> 02:12:57,445
Achu...

1915
02:12:57,445 --> 02:12:59,174
Oh! You are also here...

1916
02:13:00,215 --> 02:13:01,983
Come here... I'll tell
What?

1917
02:13:01,983 --> 02:13:03,814
He is Karthik's brother.

1918
02:13:10,125 --> 02:13:11,683
I didn't know who you are...

1919
02:13:14,162 --> 02:13:15,330
Don't beat me;
I'll lose my reputation...

1920
02:13:15,330 --> 02:13:16,531
Is this your practical lab?

1921
02:13:16,531 --> 02:13:19,301
Is this the body, in which
you are learning anatomy?

1922
02:13:19,301 --> 02:13:21,970
You are roaming
with girls, right?

1923
02:13:21,970 --> 02:13:26,708
I refused, but didn't listen...

1924
02:13:26,708 --> 02:13:27,342
Who?

1925
02:13:27,342 --> 02:13:28,076
My heart...

1926
02:13:28,076 --> 02:13:30,212
My heart went
behind this girl...

1927
02:13:30,212 --> 02:13:31,079
You come with me...

1928
02:13:31,079 --> 02:13:31,580
I'll come...

1929
02:13:31,580 --> 02:13:32,314
You stay here...

1930
02:13:32,314 --> 02:13:33,212
Come...

1931
02:13:37,385 --> 02:13:40,088
I bent her with great difficulty...

1932
02:13:40,088 --> 02:13:41,656
...Will he straighten her
talking something?

1933
02:13:41,656 --> 02:13:43,091
Let that girl be saved...

1934
02:13:43,091 --> 02:13:43,989
Go dog! Pakara...

1935
02:13:48,463 --> 02:13:51,866
I don't know who are you
& what type of girl you are...

1936
02:13:51,866 --> 02:13:57,005
Now some girl's intention is campus
fascination & enjoyment...

1937
02:13:57,005 --> 02:14:00,075
If you too are like that,
he is not the right choice...

1938
02:14:00,075 --> 02:14:01,309
He is everything to me...

1939
02:14:01,309 --> 02:14:04,346
I don't like to see him
suffering...

1940
02:14:04,346 --> 02:14:06,281
I also have a brother like you...

1941
02:14:06,281 --> 02:14:08,316
He loves me...

1942
02:14:08,316 --> 02:14:11,786
I am going to tell him frankly
that I love a boy...

1943
02:14:11,786 --> 02:14:13,255
Can I believe that?

1944
02:14:13,255 --> 02:14:16,191
I am not a type of girl
to take life as a joke...

1945
02:14:16,191 --> 02:14:18,284
I decided only after thinking
so many times...

1946
02:14:19,527 --> 02:14:21,696
This answer is enough for me.

1947
02:14:21,696 --> 02:14:23,031
Don't tell anything...

1948
02:14:23,031 --> 02:14:23,298
No...

1949
02:14:23,298 --> 02:14:24,199
He is coming...

1950
02:14:24,199 --> 02:14:26,099
See that afterwards,
first do my job...

1951
02:14:26,835 --> 02:14:27,669
Pakara... Pakara... Pakara...
Yes...

1952
02:14:27,669 --> 02:14:29,804
Don't allow these two to roam.

1953
02:14:29,804 --> 02:14:31,873
Their reins must be
in your hands...

1954
02:14:31,873 --> 02:14:34,442
Otherwise they will go
for the practical class...

1955
02:14:34,442 --> 02:14:35,810
Where is the time for him?

1956
02:14:35,810 --> 02:14:37,779
He is always with her...

1957
02:14:37,779 --> 02:14:39,440
...Taking 24 hours tuition...

1958
02:14:39,814 --> 02:14:40,649
Deva... he is bluffing...

1959
02:14:40,649 --> 02:14:42,751
Don't allow the students to
talk like this, marry her soon.

1960
02:14:42,751 --> 02:14:44,119
Now we got the license...

1961
02:14:44,119 --> 02:14:46,021
Brother also should get married.

1962
02:14:46,021 --> 02:14:47,489
That Janu in the laboratory...

1963
02:14:47,489 --> 02:14:48,623
That sweeper
Stop...

1964
02:14:48,623 --> 02:14:51,826
Don't play anymore; you must
become a doctor in 3 years...

1965
02:14:51,826 --> 02:14:55,489
3 years are not necessary brother; 10 months
are enough to have a daughter...

1966
02:14:56,798 --> 02:15:00,635
Deva, I am telling you seriously,
Janu is a right choice...

1967
02:15:00,635 --> 02:15:02,535
He won't understand...

1968
02:15:53,455 --> 02:15:54,289
Go...
It's me...

1969
02:15:54,289 --> 02:15:54,956
Go...

1970
02:15:54,956 --> 02:15:58,026
I'll stay here; there is
nothing good there...

1971
02:15:58,026 --> 02:15:59,060
Go & consult
a doctor for that.

1972
02:15:59,060 --> 02:16:00,254
That's why;
I came to see you...

1973
02:16:03,932 --> 02:16:05,633
Why are you standing here?

1974
02:16:05,633 --> 02:16:09,104
This is the time
I should be with her...

1975
02:16:09,104 --> 02:16:10,538
It is not the delivery that's
going to happen here...

1976
02:16:10,538 --> 02:16:12,374
Why are you talking
without mercy?

1977
02:16:12,374 --> 02:16:13,208
Now?

1978
02:16:13,208 --> 02:16:15,472
Must wish her again.

1979
02:16:17,078 --> 02:16:18,813
The stage is there, are you
going to hide with fear?

1980
02:16:18,813 --> 02:16:21,008
She is going to the bathroom...

1981
02:16:52,113 --> 02:16:54,282
Did you think that
I won't get bail...?

1982
02:16:54,282 --> 02:16:57,552
If money is thrown any
advocate will fall...

1983
02:16:57,552 --> 02:16:58,917
...Any court will bend...

1984
02:17:04,225 --> 02:17:08,127
The advocate says if you give witness
in the court, he'll surely be sentenced...

1985
02:17:11,032 --> 02:17:12,693
Karthik...

1986
02:17:23,678 --> 02:17:26,881
I already told him to kill her,
but he didn't agree...

1987
02:17:26,881 --> 02:17:28,550
See what happened
by leaving her?

1988
02:17:28,550 --> 02:17:32,020
Morphine... it is not necessary for me
to tell you the effects as you know it...

1989
02:17:32,020 --> 02:17:34,022
An injection with a heavy dose...

1990
02:17:34,022 --> 02:17:38,755
After that doctors will have to fight
for years to bring you out of Coma.

1991
02:17:53,842 --> 02:17:54,676
Leave her...

1992
02:17:54,676 --> 02:17:56,701
...She won't be able
to give witness anymore...

1993
02:17:59,080 --> 02:18:02,413
You wait with Mahendran
in the car, I'll come...

1994
02:18:25,406 --> 02:18:26,140
Where is Ashwadhi?

1995
02:18:26,140 --> 02:18:26,941
She hasn't come yet...

1996
02:18:26,941 --> 02:18:27,742
Not come yet?

1997
02:18:27,742 --> 02:18:28,943
No. Go & see...

1998
02:18:28,943 --> 02:18:29,310
Hold this...

1999
02:18:29,310 --> 02:18:30,607
Come...

2000
02:18:35,083 --> 02:18:36,918
You do one thing,
look there...

2001
02:18:36,918 --> 02:18:37,919
...I'll see that side...

2002
02:18:37,919 --> 02:18:39,654
Where is Achu?

2003
02:18:39,654 --> 02:18:41,679
She'll come now, Jyothi,
you call the next name...

2004
02:19:27,435 --> 02:19:28,299
Stop there.

2005
02:19:32,807 --> 02:19:35,207
My Ashwadhi...

2006
02:21:23,851 --> 02:21:25,216
Where did he go?

2007
02:21:39,801 --> 02:21:40,631
Put him in the dickey...

2008
02:22:01,856 --> 02:22:10,059
Then, I saw parts of Karthik's body
scattered separately in 3 states.

2009
02:22:14,769 --> 02:22:19,540
When Devan came to know
about Karthik's death, he fainted...

2010
02:22:19,540 --> 02:22:24,779
He couldn't realize what happened
& how Karthik's body was cremated.

2011
02:22:24,779 --> 02:22:29,773
I came to know that Devan is in prison
only after the S.P. told me...

2012
02:22:31,319 --> 02:22:33,344
It was your mistake...

2013
02:22:34,822 --> 02:22:38,588
For your sister only
Devan's brother...

2014
02:22:40,061 --> 02:22:42,964
A ragging in the college.
A shock because of that.

2015
02:22:42,964 --> 02:22:44,532
That's what I believed.

2016
02:22:44,532 --> 02:22:50,471
I thought my sister's life would be spoiled
if it came out, so I kept everything in me.

2017
02:23:14,829 --> 02:23:21,792
Advocate! You'll feel sorry later
for ruining my chance.

2018
02:23:25,373 --> 02:23:27,341
Brother...

2019
02:23:43,191 --> 02:23:45,955
Advocate Ramesh Nambiar
has come to see you...

2020
02:23:47,428 --> 02:23:49,163
I don't want to see anybody...

2021
02:23:49,163 --> 02:23:52,064
He wants to talk
about something...

2022
02:23:54,101 --> 02:23:55,803
Didn't I tell you, I don't want
to see anybody?

2023
02:23:55,803 --> 02:23:58,601
If you don't want to see,
don't see...

2024
02:24:03,845 --> 02:24:04,645
Where is he?

2025
02:24:04,645 --> 02:24:06,613
He says he doesn't want
to see anybody...

2026
02:24:06,981 --> 02:24:08,749
Did you tell him that Dr. Vinoth Baskar
has come with me?

2027
02:24:08,749 --> 02:24:13,152
We can't drag somebody
who refuses to see anybody...

2028
02:24:22,997 --> 02:24:24,897
What shall we do, now?

2029
02:25:09,644 --> 02:25:12,480
Why Punnekkadan has come
to see me?

2030
02:25:12,480 --> 02:25:18,519
Police have the right to enter a place
where unexpected things happen...

2031
02:25:18,519 --> 02:25:22,189
You policemen are accustomed
to talk in a round about way...

2032
02:25:22,189 --> 02:25:23,724
I'll tell you directly...

2033
02:25:23,724 --> 02:25:25,927
Here, have a look at this...

2034
02:25:25,927 --> 02:25:31,899
It is a courier came to Thiruvambadi,
threatening to kill Mahendran & Ganeshan.

2035
02:25:31,899 --> 02:25:32,600
So...

2036
02:25:32,600 --> 02:25:37,338
When a police officer like me
& an efficient advocate like you enquire...

2037
02:25:37,338 --> 02:25:41,342
...any accused could be produced
in the court & punishment obtained.

2038
02:25:41,342 --> 02:25:44,178
If the defendant's advocate is
efficient than me?

2039
02:25:44,178 --> 02:25:48,916
The accused would escape & repeat
their criminal activities in the country...

2040
02:25:48,916 --> 02:25:50,751
An efficient
advocate than you?

2041
02:25:50,751 --> 02:25:54,221
Your service is more important
for the poor people...

2042
02:25:54,221 --> 02:25:56,357
You can play with your law
in the court...

2043
02:25:56,357 --> 02:25:58,392
...But not on the street.

2044
02:25:58,392 --> 02:26:00,227
Tell me, who sent this?

2045
02:26:00,227 --> 02:26:01,629
I don't know...

2046
02:26:01,629 --> 02:26:03,597
If it is not you, then who, Devan?

2047
02:26:03,597 --> 02:26:05,166
How could I know?

2048
02:26:05,166 --> 02:26:07,234
It is not possible for Devan,
who is in jail...

2049
02:26:07,234 --> 02:26:07,902
Then, who?

2050
02:26:07,902 --> 02:26:11,633
It must be the person who has the enmity
with those persons of that house...

2051
02:26:13,074 --> 02:26:16,777
Mr. Punnekkadan is stubborn,
isn't it? I forgot him.

2052
02:26:16,777 --> 02:26:20,147
I didn't come here to hear
your speaking talent...

2053
02:26:20,147 --> 02:26:21,749
I tell you something...

2054
02:26:21,749 --> 02:26:25,720
Nobody can make the words
in this letter come true.

2055
02:26:25,720 --> 02:26:28,823
Unless Punnekkadan
loses his post...

2056
02:26:28,823 --> 02:26:31,158
You should have some faith...

2057
02:26:31,158 --> 02:26:35,896
If somebody wants to kill a person
God only could do the miracle to save him.

2058
02:26:35,896 --> 02:26:38,733
God won't do
the miracle directly...

2059
02:26:38,733 --> 02:26:41,201
...He'll do it sometimes in the
disguise of officers like me...

2060
02:26:42,136 --> 02:26:48,175
Mahendran & Ganesh are the main
suspects in Karthik's murder case...

2061
02:26:48,175 --> 02:26:50,511
This is the court order
to arrest them...

2062
02:26:50,511 --> 02:26:53,814
I'll arrest them & put them in the lockup...

2063
02:26:53,814 --> 02:26:57,477
With in hours... Then I'll see
how the murderer enters?

2064
02:27:21,575 --> 02:27:22,576
Stop there...

2065
02:27:22,576 --> 02:27:25,546
Are you showing your power
entering the house?

2066
02:27:25,546 --> 02:27:31,781
Leave me...

2067
02:27:34,688 --> 02:27:37,782
Let him does his duty,
don't interrupt...

2068
02:27:49,036 --> 02:27:50,264
What?

2069
02:27:52,006 --> 02:27:52,773
What is this mother?

2070
02:27:52,773 --> 02:27:53,569
I don't know, child...

2071
02:27:54,475 --> 02:27:55,806
Nobody is there sir...

2072
02:28:11,225 --> 02:28:12,293
Is the search over?

2073
02:28:12,293 --> 02:28:14,728
He is doing the house
upside down.

2074
02:28:14,728 --> 02:28:16,130
He is coming.

2075
02:28:16,130 --> 02:28:18,223
Nobody is there sir...

2076
02:28:31,512 --> 02:28:34,748
What S.P. Sir, you didn't get anything
even after searching?

2077
02:28:34,748 --> 02:28:38,809
Police vehicle is not as fast
as a phone call, isn't it?

2078
02:28:40,421 --> 02:28:43,591
If you take this warrant &
go searching all over the world,

2079
02:28:43,591 --> 02:28:47,828
...You won't arrest the non-bailable
Mahendran or Ganesh...

2080
02:28:47,828 --> 02:28:50,898
Because our advocate is
Ramesh Nambiar...

2081
02:28:50,898 --> 02:28:51,866
Then, they will be saved...

2082
02:28:51,866 --> 02:28:55,436
Do the death rituals at the
Aluva shore next winter.

2083
02:28:55,436 --> 02:28:57,063
For Ganeshan & Mahendran...

2084
02:29:12,653 --> 02:29:15,890
Never mind, where did
you hide them both?

2085
02:29:15,890 --> 02:29:17,289
Come, I'll tell you...

2086
02:29:24,665 --> 02:29:25,563
Come...

2087
02:29:28,435 --> 02:29:29,470
Come here...

2088
02:29:29,470 --> 02:29:34,575
Even if we have to hide them for 10 years,
no one could find this place...

2089
02:29:34,575 --> 02:29:37,478
I need only a week's time
to file anticipatory bail...

2090
02:29:37,478 --> 02:29:38,746
...But I must know the truth...

2091
02:29:38,746 --> 02:29:41,782
They have not committed
such a big mistake to hide.

2092
02:29:41,782 --> 02:29:45,081
When compared to what I did
& said, this is nothing.

2093
02:29:46,153 --> 02:29:48,519
Because of necessity
a man was killed, that's all.

2094
02:29:52,793 --> 02:29:56,163
What was the necessity to kill;
I want to know only that...

2095
02:29:56,163 --> 02:29:58,432
5, 6 months back...

2096
02:29:58,432 --> 02:30:00,768
A girl in the medical college where
Arun was studying committed suicide...

2097
02:30:00,768 --> 02:30:04,104
Another girl gave statement
that it was a murder...

2098
02:30:04,104 --> 02:30:07,474
We told several times not to do it,
but she didn't listen...

2099
02:30:07,474 --> 02:30:10,678
Because of that we had to
spend lakhs to bring Arun out.

2100
02:30:10,678 --> 02:30:17,785
Could we leave her? When we had the
chance we planned & taught her a lesson.

2101
02:30:17,785 --> 02:30:22,089
A lesson, which she cannot
forget in her life time...

2102
02:30:22,089 --> 02:30:25,226
At that time, a fellow came to save her
without having any connection.

2103
02:30:25,226 --> 02:30:26,360
His fate...

2104
02:30:26,360 --> 02:30:27,861
We didn't do it
wholeheartedly...

2105
02:30:27,861 --> 02:30:29,129
There was no any complaint
on behalf of her.

2106
02:30:29,129 --> 02:30:31,597
The confusion was because of someone
who came from somewhere.

2107
02:30:33,133 --> 02:30:34,930
What are you thinking about?

2108
02:30:36,237 --> 02:30:39,540
Devan's hearing starts
on 21st of this month...

2109
02:30:39,540 --> 02:30:40,841
He will get life sentence.

2110
02:30:40,841 --> 02:30:41,575
Life sentence?

2111
02:30:41,575 --> 02:30:44,211
I want the dead body of him,
who killed my son...

2112
02:30:44,211 --> 02:30:48,582
I've removed everybody who stood on my
way, including this Punnekkadan's father.

2113
02:30:48,582 --> 02:30:51,719
When you have the party & the thugs
in your hand, you can do anything.

2114
02:30:51,719 --> 02:30:54,154
But I'll tell you how
to handle this case.

2115
02:30:54,154 --> 02:30:59,593
When Devan appears in the court,
your thugs should attack him.

2116
02:30:59,593 --> 02:31:03,998
Naturally, police will concentrate
on dispersing the mob.

2117
02:31:03,998 --> 02:31:05,799
At that time, I'll produce
them in the court...

2118
02:31:05,799 --> 02:31:11,965
In that confusion, you may kill
or do anything to Devan.

2119
02:31:13,507 --> 02:31:16,243
It would be the breaking news in the channels...

2120
02:31:16,243 --> 02:31:19,280
Devan's murder...
A political vengeance.

2121
02:31:19,280 --> 02:31:22,272
Next day it will be the headlines
in the prominent papers.

2122
02:31:29,423 --> 02:31:33,291
You are suspended for helping
a criminal like me, isn't it?

2123
02:31:34,595 --> 02:31:35,663
Jailor told me...

2124
02:31:35,663 --> 02:31:38,499
I feel proud of it...

2125
02:31:38,499 --> 02:31:40,968
...I was able to do
at least this help...

2126
02:31:40,968 --> 02:31:42,736
Tomorrow the hearing begins...

2127
02:31:42,736 --> 02:31:45,039
Advocate Gopha Kumar is appearing
for you in the case...

2128
02:31:45,039 --> 02:31:46,507
Here is the vakalat...

2129
02:31:46,507 --> 02:31:47,496
Sign it...

2130
02:31:52,479 --> 02:31:58,748
Ramesh Nambiar is the advocate,
who is going to argue against me, right?

2131
02:32:01,822 --> 02:32:03,624
I don't know for how many years
I'll be punished...

2132
02:32:03,624 --> 02:32:06,894
I am not worried about that.

2133
02:32:06,894 --> 02:32:12,799
But when I think about the increase of
lifetime to those who killed my brother...

2134
02:32:15,002 --> 02:32:18,272
If I get a chance,
I'll kill them...

2135
02:32:18,272 --> 02:32:21,139
Even if it is in the court.

2136
02:32:21,975 --> 02:32:26,639
Jaya! Our men must be
with me tomorrow.

2137
02:32:27,781 --> 02:32:29,681
Balance...

2138
02:32:42,396 --> 02:32:44,591
Van has come bringing him
from the jail.

2139
02:32:49,737 --> 02:32:53,366
He will try to escape by any way,
so finish him here itself.

2140
02:32:53,874 --> 02:32:56,110
It would be an advantage
having him handcuffed.

2141
02:32:56,110 --> 02:32:58,044
Punneppa! Bring him,
when the case is called.

2142
02:33:11,792 --> 02:33:13,885
Do you have an idea
to escape?

2143
02:33:16,930 --> 02:33:19,831
It would be difficult to escape
with the handcuffs, isn't it?

2144
02:33:24,671 --> 02:33:28,008
Handcuff should be removed only after
entering the court room. That's the rule.

2145
02:33:28,008 --> 02:33:31,171
But C.I. Jayachandran sir
gave me some money.

2146
02:33:31,478 --> 02:33:35,015
Petrol costs Rs.52/...
& rice costs Rs.26/...

2147
02:33:35,015 --> 02:33:37,217
...the government is increasing
all the prices except the salary...

2148
02:33:37,217 --> 02:33:39,286
When everything has increased,

2149
02:33:39,286 --> 02:33:42,289
...then what is the use of me being
a policeman without taking money...

2150
02:33:42,289 --> 02:33:46,493
But when I heard Jayendran debt
to you & your story from him.

2151
02:33:46,493 --> 02:33:48,195
I didn't want to take money...

2152
02:33:48,195 --> 02:33:54,191
Anyway, I am not going to lose
my job, after all, a suspension...

2153
02:33:57,971 --> 02:33:59,336
Get down, there is no one...

2154
02:34:00,941 --> 02:34:02,543
Keep this knife with you...

2155
02:34:02,543 --> 02:34:07,446
When the police try to kill you
while escaping, kill yourself with this.

2156
02:34:49,523 --> 02:34:50,490
Deva! Get in.

2157
02:35:37,271 --> 02:35:39,432
Don't get down till I tell you...

2158
02:35:58,392 --> 02:36:00,360
I was not aware
of the truth...

2159
02:36:00,360 --> 02:36:04,631
Your brother was killed
to save my sister...

2160
02:36:04,631 --> 02:36:10,536
No court in the world will forgive
the crime they have committed...

2161
02:36:11,471 --> 02:36:15,842
For your brother's life
& my sister's life...

2162
02:36:15,842 --> 02:36:21,246
& for the safety of all the brother's
& sister's lives... shoot...

2163
02:36:22,683 --> 02:36:24,048
I am with you...

2164
02:36:41,668 --> 02:36:42,600
Don't let him go.

2165
02:36:55,849 --> 02:36:56,611
Catch him...

2166
02:40:35,135 --> 02:40:38,969
I'll...

2167
02:41:38,398 --> 02:41:41,034
You have to arrest me only...

2168
02:41:41,034 --> 02:41:42,501
It was I who killed
those two...

2169
02:41:43,770 --> 02:41:46,606
If you go to prison,
who will save me?

2170
02:41:46,606 --> 02:41:50,310
In the court campus some
thugs attacked me...

2171
02:41:50,310 --> 02:41:51,645
I had to escape...

2172
02:41:51,645 --> 02:41:55,682
They followed me & to save
myself I killed both of them...

2173
02:41:55,682 --> 02:41:57,616
Is my law point correct,
advocate?

2174
02:41:59,419 --> 02:42:02,155
You can't do anything
to him...

2175
02:42:02,155 --> 02:42:05,392
It was your duty to save
Devan during the enquiry...

2176
02:42:05,392 --> 02:42:08,061
Private defense law
will save him...

2177
02:42:08,061 --> 02:42:10,297
Don't stand staring,
arrest them...

2178
02:42:10,297 --> 02:42:13,400
You've plotted against us
staying with us...

2179
02:42:13,400 --> 02:42:15,268
Yes, I plotted...

2180
02:42:15,268 --> 02:42:17,837
Yes, if all these thugs
are enquired properly,

2181
02:42:17,837 --> 02:42:20,772
it'll be you, who will be
punished not Devan.

2182
02:42:22,375 --> 02:42:28,939
If the court rules were not adhered
he would have been dead long back.

2183
02:42:32,552 --> 02:42:34,321
Now... Here...

2184
02:42:34,321 --> 02:42:35,913
What sir? Can you?

2185
02:42:37,524 --> 02:42:40,593
You also have an old account
to be settled?

2186
02:42:40,593 --> 02:42:43,930
I know how smart
an advocate could be...

2187
02:42:43,930 --> 02:42:46,366
But I haven't seen
a person so brilliant...

2188
02:42:46,366 --> 02:42:48,969
Punnekkadan!
Where are you going? Arrest him.

2189
02:42:48,969 --> 02:42:49,769
I can't sir...

2190
02:42:49,769 --> 02:42:52,038
I don't want to do it...

2191
02:42:52,038 --> 02:42:55,633
What to do after arresting, to take
them to the court verandah?

2192
02:42:59,279 --> 02:43:03,383
To have any meaning
& principle for this police duty

2193
02:43:03,383 --> 02:43:07,053
& to gain the confidence of
the people, as this lawyer said...

2194
02:43:07,053 --> 02:43:09,613
...rogues like this Madhava Menon
must be shot at sight.

2195
02:43:15,061 --> 02:43:16,619
What are you saying?

2196
02:43:30,076 --> 02:43:35,742
Advocate said & S.P. had done it...
Let's move.
