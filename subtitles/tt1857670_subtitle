1
00:01:38,342 --> 00:01:42,542
God's own child

3
00:02:43,216 --> 00:02:44,721
City of Chennai welcomes you

4
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,085
No-good nut case! Get lost

5
00:04:04,497 --> 00:04:06,003
You don't want your money?

6
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:09,370
Nila...?

7
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:10,396
What?

8
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,407
Nila

9
00:04:12,498 --> 00:04:14,233
You lost someone?

10
00:04:16,082 --> 00:04:18,646
I'll tell you where to go

11
00:04:23,314 --> 00:04:27,482
Keep this in your shirt
Not in your pant pocket

12
00:04:31,698 --> 00:04:34,328
What's your name?
Where are you from?

13
00:04:35,603 --> 00:04:37,916
Krishna

14
00:04:38,002 --> 00:04:39,988
...from Avalanchi

15
00:04:41,394 --> 00:04:43,227
Chocolate factory

16
00:04:44,179 --> 00:04:48,729
Gate...cows

17
00:04:48,819 --> 00:04:53,849
Give me time to write
Repeat what you said

18
00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:56,340
- What's your name?
- Krishna

19
00:05:01,332 --> 00:05:04,245
What do you want?

20
00:05:05,235 --> 00:05:08,246
I want Nila

21
00:05:12,019 --> 00:05:13,558
Nila is missing

22
00:05:13,683 --> 00:05:16,378
Doesn't look like you lost someone
You are the one who seems lost!

23
00:05:16,467 --> 00:05:20,090
- Someone must be searching for you
- I want Nila

24
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,526
This is a police station
You shouldn't be here

25
00:05:22,611 --> 00:05:25,689
Come with a friend, relative or a lawyer

26
00:05:28,052 --> 00:05:29,722
You'll find a lawyer in court

27
00:05:35,636 --> 00:05:37,720
It's time to go to the court
Shall we leave?

28
00:05:37,812 --> 00:05:42,363
Make sure everyone boards the van

29
00:05:57,269 --> 00:05:59,735
Rape or drugs? Tell me what case

30
00:05:59,829 --> 00:06:00,767
We'll take you out in a jiffy

31
00:06:00,853 --> 00:06:02,523
Go in like this
Out in a jiffy like that

32
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:04,762
Go in...get out
We'll take you out in a jiffy

33
00:06:04,852 --> 00:06:06,719
What are we here for?

34
00:06:08,725 --> 00:06:11,551
Hey! You there!

35
00:06:12,693 --> 00:06:14,046
How did you get in here?

36
00:06:16,693 --> 00:06:17,566
Get down

37
00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:20,763
This one is without a lawyer!

38
00:06:22,613 --> 00:06:25,178
Go in like this
Out in a jiffy like that

39
00:06:25,269 --> 00:06:26,687
- What's your case?
- Murder

40
00:06:26,837 --> 00:06:29,237
- How many?
- One

41
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:32,830
Just 1? I expected much more from you

42
00:06:32,917 --> 00:06:36,507
- Whom did you kill?
- Lawyer who defended me and lost

43
00:06:38,326 --> 00:06:39,766
You are my lawyer from now on

44
00:06:39,862 --> 00:06:43,703
I am not a lawyer
I'm a tea shop owner

45
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,118
How come you are dressed this way?

46
00:06:45,494 --> 00:06:47,480
Because it's so cold, sir

47
00:06:53,046 --> 00:06:55,065
You have even started
selling tea and coffee, sir?

48
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:58,016
- Looks like that will be my job!
- How can you say that, 'Mr Lawyer'?

49
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:01,089
- What did you call me?
- 'Mr Lawyer'

50
00:07:01,334 --> 00:07:03,964
Looks like I myself need to be reminded

51
00:07:04,406 --> 00:07:05,760
Why don't you get me a case?

52
00:07:05,846 --> 00:07:10,397
Look at that man over there in a sweater
Catch hold of him

53
00:07:10,487 --> 00:07:11,546
Good one?

54
00:07:17,366 --> 00:07:19,320
My boss is a very experienced lawyer

55
00:07:19,415 --> 00:07:21,564
You can go in like this
Be out in a jiffy like that

56
00:07:21,654 --> 00:07:22,876
You don't worry about it

57
00:07:37,495 --> 00:07:40,190
Stop!

58
00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:46,366
Grab him, sir

59
00:07:46,456 --> 00:07:50,461
He claims he will kill a lawyer
Kaatumiraandi! Senseless savage!!

60
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:52,606
Dented tin-head!!

61
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,262
Many a miss between
the mouth and the magistrate!

62
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,128
Don't you worry, sir

63
00:08:12,216 --> 00:08:14,617
Come in

64
00:08:14,711 --> 00:08:16,610
Please be seated

65
00:08:27,704 --> 00:08:31,326
I've got hold of a super client
Come to our room immediately

66
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:34,042
I'm inside the court room
Call me later

67
00:08:34,136 --> 00:08:37,377
it's not as if you are defending a case
You are just gaping at the proceedings

68
00:08:37,464 --> 00:08:38,686
Come out

69
00:08:47,417 --> 00:08:50,843
I never thought
I'll get back my property so soon

70
00:08:51,673 --> 00:08:54,368
- Anu, how long?
- I'm coming

71
00:08:56,601 --> 00:08:59,579
I only wanted
what's my rightful inheritance

72
00:08:59,929 --> 00:09:02,395
You blatantly lied
that I am not my dad's son!

73
00:09:02,489 --> 00:09:05,882
If you had come to me first
I'd have said the same about him

74
00:09:09,657 --> 00:09:11,228
I'll take care

75
00:09:15,257 --> 00:09:17,406
How many times
to tell you not to call me 'dear'?

76
00:09:17,562 --> 00:09:19,810
Why are you irritated?
You haven't got a case till now?

77
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:23,329
Mind your business!

78
00:09:30,042 --> 00:09:31,395
It's some missing case

79
00:09:31,513 --> 00:09:35,169
Imagine! He must be filthy rich to
roam around Chennai wearing a sweater!!

80
00:09:35,258 --> 00:09:37,757
He must forever be used
to air conditioning

81
00:09:45,786 --> 00:09:50,402
I'll call you discreetly from inside
Let's pretend to be in great demand

82
00:09:52,602 --> 00:09:56,869
We are dependent on him this month
Don't mess it up as usual

83
00:10:15,259 --> 00:10:17,824
That's my business card for you

84
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:27,197
How can I help you?

85
00:10:36,571 --> 00:10:39,845
Who are you?
Where did you come from?

86
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:41,950
Krishna

87
00:10:47,324 --> 00:10:49,953
Goats...cows

88
00:10:50,043 --> 00:10:51,582
Not cows

89
00:10:54,812 --> 00:10:57,442
Lots of trees

90
00:10:57,884 --> 00:10:59,554
There's a huge tree

91
00:11:00,539 --> 00:11:03,202
There's major feud
between the Ambani brothers

92
00:11:03,292 --> 00:11:06,402
They want you to fly to Delhi tonight

93
00:11:07,452 --> 00:11:10,311
I'll tell them you won't come
without completing this case

94
00:11:14,429 --> 00:11:16,894
You were saying...

95
00:11:24,188 --> 00:11:29,121
Gate...goats...cows

96
00:11:31,645 --> 00:11:33,118
There's a huge tree

97
00:11:33,629 --> 00:11:40,863
Your client is waiting out with
Rs 150000 for winning his case

98
00:11:41,629 --> 00:11:44,324
I'm so sorry I blurted
your fees in front of our client

99
00:11:49,053 --> 00:11:50,406
You continue...

100
00:11:52,157 --> 00:11:55,103
That huge tree

101
00:11:56,221 --> 00:11:58,982
Is he still at that same tree?!

102
00:12:00,669 --> 00:12:06,245
I put chocolates into a bag...tie it...

103
00:12:15,486 --> 00:12:19,840
Goats and cows lying down by the roadside

104
00:12:23,294 --> 00:12:24,483
I'll be right back

105
00:12:29,406 --> 00:12:31,393
What are you up to?

106
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:35,329
Urgent case

107
00:12:35,423 --> 00:12:37,289
She needs to get divorced
She's getting married this evening

108
00:12:37,406 --> 00:12:38,879
You got to help her right now

109
00:12:49,151 --> 00:12:51,050
Listen to me

110
00:12:51,231 --> 00:12:53,926
Nila (moon) will be seen tonight
We'll hold it safely for you

111
00:12:54,015 --> 00:12:56,481
You come back tonight

112
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:04,170
You couldn't have found a better case!

113
00:13:04,479 --> 00:13:07,360
How did I know he'd be a nut case?

114
00:13:08,415 --> 00:13:11,689
Go and get a good case

115
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:15,875
Serves me right for not studying well!

116
00:13:24,415 --> 00:13:26,085
Why is he still here?

117
00:13:26,175 --> 00:13:30,016
You ask me to bring in a case for you
Then you ask me to pack him off

118
00:13:30,111 --> 00:13:31,814
What do you take me for?
'Use and throw'?

119
00:13:31,904 --> 00:13:34,566
Fine...how do we go out now?

120
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,681
Drink this tea
I have ordered lunch

121
00:13:40,767 --> 00:13:43,714
Usually we try to get our client out

122
00:13:43,808 --> 00:13:47,878
Now, we are breaking our heads
how to get ourselves out!

123
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,506
What's this new case I'm unaware of

124
00:14:00,896 --> 00:14:01,834
That's a political recommendation

125
00:14:14,849 --> 00:14:17,610
You blabbered to that man
you won't grant him divorce!

126
00:14:45,378 --> 00:14:46,218
What are you glaring at me for?

127
00:14:46,305 --> 00:14:49,732
Pig faced bum...grab him
He threatens to kill lawyers

128
00:14:49,826 --> 00:14:52,553
Kaatumiraandi! Barbaric beast!!
Put him behind bars

129
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:56,996
We can't, sir
He is out on bail

130
00:15:02,721 --> 00:15:03,976
If you are free you can visit my shop

131
00:15:04,066 --> 00:15:06,598
Grab a bite and a cup of tea or coffee

132
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:16,197
Let's run this way
Mr Sweater is there

133
00:15:19,394 --> 00:15:20,518
This n nutcase

134
00:15:21,282 --> 00:15:23,082
How many times to tell you?!!!

135
00:15:28,098 --> 00:15:31,655
He had Anu's card
I found him for you

136
00:15:31,747 --> 00:15:35,947
This place is swarming with maniacs!

137
00:15:38,179 --> 00:15:39,565
Get lost

138
00:15:43,523 --> 00:15:45,672
You want Nila?

139
00:15:45,795 --> 00:15:49,800
We'll go bring it for you
You be here

140
00:15:51,299 --> 00:15:52,837
Don't follow us

141
00:15:55,459 --> 00:15:57,227
We'll be back soon

142
00:15:59,523 --> 00:16:01,989
Just wait for us here

143
00:16:03,811 --> 00:16:05,382
Moon...moon

144
00:16:17,892 --> 00:16:22,475
When, where, whom
we meet can be pre determined

145
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:16,879
Are you Anu?

146
00:17:18,629 --> 00:17:20,070
Court closes at 6:00 RM

147
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:24,039
We asked him to leave
We even beat him to a pulp

148
00:17:24,134 --> 00:17:25,519
He's refusing to budge from here

149
00:17:25,893 --> 00:17:29,221
We found your business card on him
Do you know him?

150
00:17:29,733 --> 00:17:34,153
You promised...to bring Nila...for me

151
00:17:36,614 --> 00:17:40,236
It seems he is Krishna
He is mentally challenged

152
00:17:40,581 --> 00:17:44,073
Avalanchi is a small village near Ooty

153
00:17:44,261 --> 00:17:48,397
I found out Mr Wctor
owns Emerald chocolate factory

154
00:17:48,486 --> 00:17:52,753
He's the only person to know
Krishna 's story fully

155
00:17:55,590 --> 00:18:00,685
They took Nila away

156
00:18:00,775 --> 00:18:03,950
I want my Nila

157
00:18:04,038 --> 00:18:05,359
Please wait out...

158
00:18:05,446 --> 00:18:08,141
if he gets too emotional
his blood pressure will rise

159
00:18:20,167 --> 00:18:21,771
Who is Nila?

160
00:18:25,894 --> 00:18:27,433
Is Nila his wife?

161
00:18:29,927 --> 00:18:31,564
Or his sister?

162
00:18:34,183 --> 00:18:35,503
Who is Nila?

163
00:19:23,689 --> 00:19:26,482
Hey look there! What's Krishna up to?

164
00:19:30,824 --> 00:19:35,919
Get down

165
00:19:46,121 --> 00:19:49,678
You should be in your home
You shouldn't be down

166
00:19:50,313 --> 00:19:51,918
You are such a tiny baby

167
00:20:11,113 --> 00:20:15,909
http://movieshdnow.com

168
00:20:30,122 --> 00:20:31,922
Why are you so happy?

169
00:20:32,298 --> 00:20:37,677
I'll soon have a baby of my own
A mini girl or boy

170
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:43,084
She or he will ask me
to buy many a cuddly toy

171
00:20:43,178 --> 00:20:46,866
From today I'll dance and rejoice

172
00:20:46,955 --> 00:20:50,479
...in absolute joy!

173
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:07,533
I'll soon have a baby of my own
A mini girl or boy

174
00:21:07,627 --> 00:21:12,909
She or he will ask me
to buy many a cuddly toy

175
00:21:13,067 --> 00:21:16,689
From today I'll dance and rejoice

176
00:21:16,779 --> 00:21:19,921
...in absolute joy!

177
00:21:24,363 --> 00:21:26,578
It will take an hour for me
to reach Cunnoor

178
00:21:26,667 --> 00:21:30,159
How slow can you be...no fear at all

179
00:21:30,251 --> 00:21:33,841
Relax! Don't be angry
Krishna isn't here...that's why y

180
00:21:34,667 --> 00:21:36,587
What did he say?

181
00:21:38,636 --> 00:21:40,589
Cat got your tongue?

182
00:21:44,588 --> 00:21:46,454
I can't digest it myself

183
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:49,398
You won't be able to bear it
You are better off not knowing

184
00:21:49,548 --> 00:21:50,672
I am better off not knowing?

185
00:21:50,764 --> 00:21:52,018
What did he say?

186
00:21:53,963 --> 00:21:55,153
Where are you going?

187
00:21:55,308 --> 00:21:56,562
I want to see Victor

188
00:21:56,652 --> 00:21:58,037
Aren't you working?

189
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:03,629
I am having a baby
I won't be working

190
00:22:03,852 --> 00:22:05,871
Now that you are here you might
as well tell me loud and clear

191
00:22:09,132 --> 00:22:12,438
I am having a baby
I won't be working

192
00:22:18,861 --> 00:22:21,938
We must deliver the chocolates in time

193
00:22:22,028 --> 00:22:24,855
Only you can do it,
we can't trust these guys

194
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,675
Be a sport

195
00:22:27,053 --> 00:22:31,848
A http://movieshdnow.com D VD

196
00:23:02,158 --> 00:23:03,379
What are you doing here?

197
00:23:05,357 --> 00:23:07,573
Murthy asked me to work

198
00:23:08,045 --> 00:23:11,024
I swear on my wife
I didn't ask him to work

199
00:23:11,918 --> 00:23:14,548
He has to be in hospital
Why are you delaying him?

200
00:23:14,638 --> 00:23:18,610
I agree totally
What are you doing here?

201
00:23:18,734 --> 00:23:20,436
Krishna never lies

202
00:23:22,222 --> 00:23:24,306
Did Bhanu give you a list?

203
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:28,817
Murthy, drop Krishna in the market
when you go for delivery

204
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:31,987
Buy everything, go to the hospital
I'll see you later

205
00:23:34,255 --> 00:23:36,437
What do you have to buy?

206
00:23:36,558 --> 00:23:39,221
I 'll buy kaajal for her twinkling eyes

207
00:23:39,342 --> 00:23:41,972
Tiny anklets as a tinkling device

208
00:23:42,062 --> 00:23:44,660
Oh! 1 more in my to-do list

209
00:23:44,847 --> 00:23:47,608
Why don't I remember what it is?

210
00:23:47,823 --> 00:23:50,420
A blue shirt for that pretty face

211
00:23:50,511 --> 00:23:53,108
I'll add a pink dress just in case

212
00:23:53,199 --> 00:23:55,796
Let me shop till I drop

213
00:23:55,886 --> 00:23:58,287
On a horse I'll gallop!

214
00:23:58,383 --> 00:24:01,394
All for the baby?
Nothing for Bhanu?

215
00:24:02,415 --> 00:24:03,920
Oh! You bet Bhanu will get

216
00:24:04,015 --> 00:24:06,678
An apple to keep the doctor away

217
00:24:06,767 --> 00:24:09,429
Horlicks in milk everyday

218
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:11,985
Bhanu, my love so fair

219
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:14,425
just like my baby I shall care

220
00:24:14,511 --> 00:24:17,109
Jeweled necklace like a crown

221
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,862
Waist thread to show my baby has grown

222
00:24:19,951 --> 00:24:22,516
1 more to tick in my dream list

223
00:24:22,639 --> 00:24:25,520
Oh right here...this is it!

224
00:24:25,615 --> 00:24:28,474
- Is this also for Bhanu?
- No, for the baby

225
00:24:28,591 --> 00:24:33,556
I'll soon have a baby of my own
A mini girl or boy

226
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:39,318
She or he will ask me
to buy many a cuddly toy

227
00:24:40,272 --> 00:24:41,560
No need

228
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,795
A http://movieshdnow.com D VD

229
00:25:35,153 --> 00:25:37,914
Krishna, should the baby
be like the mom or dad?

230
00:25:38,609 --> 00:25:41,239
Not a carbon copy of her dad

231
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:43,894
...nor like his mom, for I'll be glad

232
00:25:43,985 --> 00:25:46,582
...if God decides to add
a bit of both mom and dad!!

233
00:25:46,674 --> 00:25:49,587
Baby should laugh with joy never be sad

234
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:55,097
Is this that beautiful laughter?

235
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:57,658
What do we get when the baby is born?

236
00:25:57,746 --> 00:26:00,474
Lots of chocolates shall be my treat

237
00:26:00,562 --> 00:26:03,257
Whole of Ooty will enjoy a feast

238
00:26:03,346 --> 00:26:06,074
What else shall I add to my wish list?

239
00:26:06,194 --> 00:26:08,061
I'll think and tell you what it is

240
00:26:08,978 --> 00:26:11,127
Okay, what will you do with the baby?

241
00:26:11,506 --> 00:26:14,168
I'll watch him play...with other kids

242
00:26:14,258 --> 00:26:16,823
Tease hen..mock fight with counter bids

243
00:26:16,914 --> 00:26:19,292
What else will I do...?

244
00:26:19,379 --> 00:26:22,074
- What will you do?
- I'll ask Bhanu and tell you

245
00:26:22,578 --> 00:26:24,630
You won't play with Bhanu?

246
00:26:24,723 --> 00:26:27,287
Apparently I have to wait
for 300 days long

247
00:26:27,378 --> 00:26:29,910
It seems the baby
has to grow real strong

248
00:26:30,035 --> 00:26:32,730
Till then I'll Middle my thumbs and wait

249
00:26:32,819 --> 00:26:37,107
So said the doctor that's my fate!

250
00:26:42,003 --> 00:26:43,836
Take this with you

251
00:26:49,203 --> 00:26:51,668
- Where are you going?
- I'm having a baby

252
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:37,660
You've got a baby girl

253
00:28:02,805 --> 00:28:05,500
I gave your hand back to you

254
00:28:08,789 --> 00:28:10,393
I am your daddy

255
00:28:14,645 --> 00:28:21,181
Does she look like me or Bhanu?

256
00:28:24,757 --> 00:28:27,769
Where is Bhanu?

257
00:28:27,862 --> 00:28:30,873
Bhanu isn't here

258
00:28:33,493 --> 00:28:35,894
She has to nurse the baby

259
00:28:37,814 --> 00:28:41,535
When will she come?
Where has she gone?

260
00:28:41,621 --> 00:28:44,153
She's with God

261
00:29:01,623 --> 00:29:04,155
Take one last look

262
00:29:04,855 --> 00:29:09,650
Fair moon...silver moon
Fluffy cloud here's looking for you

263
00:29:15,703 --> 00:29:25,120
Precious image of you asleep
on my chest dissolves into a tear so blue

264
00:29:32,246 --> 00:29:36,731
You are sitting there
oblivious to the baby's cries

265
00:29:39,191 --> 00:29:41,308
What should I do?

266
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:48,121
My dear life, without you
I am not alive today

267
00:29:50,391 --> 00:29:55,072
- Babies need milk once in 3 hours
- Really?!

268
00:29:57,656 --> 00:30:02,905
Only because of you
my heart is shattered honestly

269
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,412
I remember..l reminisce
I long for you, my dear

270
00:30:08,727 --> 00:30:14,271
I search for your fragrance
in the atmosphere

271
00:30:33,848 --> 00:30:35,714
Take care
Don't drop the baby

272
00:31:08,377 --> 00:31:10,756
I won't talk to you

273
00:31:20,377 --> 00:31:25,091
Muruga...Muruga...lyappa

274
00:31:26,137 --> 00:31:29,313
Why won't you talk?
What wrong did he do?

275
00:31:29,402 --> 00:31:31,551
Wasn't March 21st your birthday?

276
00:31:33,402 --> 00:31:36,261
But he wasn't with us
Let us not talk to him

277
00:31:36,346 --> 00:31:37,983
We won't talk to you

278
00:31:41,658 --> 00:31:44,571
Why are you crying like a baby?

279
00:31:44,634 --> 00:31:46,172
Not me...baby is crying

280
00:31:46,266 --> 00:31:48,034
Hush! Don't cry

281
00:31:51,866 --> 00:31:57,759
- Baby! Whose baby is this?
- Bhanu and me

282
00:31:57,851 --> 00:31:59,040
What is her name?

283
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:04,095
Sita...Rama...jungle...cuckoo

284
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:09,634
Don't name her
Everyone will call her by that name!

285
00:32:15,867 --> 00:32:17,471
Nila (moon)

286
00:32:21,627 --> 00:32:24,354
Her name is Nila

287
00:32:34,907 --> 00:32:38,748
This is Nila

288
00:32:39,355 --> 00:32:40,960
Daddy

289
00:32:41,052 --> 00:32:42,918
Look up...mummy

290
00:32:43,003 --> 00:32:44,957
She is refusing to eat
Tell her, Bhanu

291
00:32:51,131 --> 00:32:52,452
Did you call for me?

292
00:32:52,539 --> 00:32:54,459
I got a complaint

293
00:32:55,036 --> 00:32:59,237
For every kilo there is a shortage of
50 grams in what you delivered

294
00:32:59,356 --> 00:33:00,775
But it was fine when we loaded the stuff

295
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:02,181
Does that mean you sold them on the way?

296
00:33:02,268 --> 00:33:05,793
I swear on my wife

297
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:08,835
You can go

298
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,719
Not you

299
00:33:12,316 --> 00:33:14,270
Why do you always swear on your wife?

300
00:33:14,972 --> 00:33:16,576
Why don't you swear on yourself?

301
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:21,381
1 more complaint like this,
you are sacked

302
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,199
- What is the weight of this?
- 2 kgs

303
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:27,234
- When you load them?
- Same

304
00:33:28,349 --> 00:33:31,360
- When you deliver them?
- Same 2 kgs

305
00:33:31,452 --> 00:33:35,970
Then how can 50gms be less
when the load reaches the shops?

306
00:33:36,605 --> 00:33:39,431
Must have melted in this Ooty weather!

307
00:33:53,566 --> 00:33:54,951
Come and sit in front

308
00:33:57,406 --> 00:34:00,101
I am sure you are the culprit

309
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:03,431
You claimed it thawed in the Ooty sunlight

310
00:34:03,518 --> 00:34:05,188
If our boss gets to know this...

311
00:34:05,278 --> 00:34:09,184
Yeah, you let go of what you should be
concentrating on and suspect me!

312
00:34:09,341 --> 00:34:10,782
What did I miss?

313
00:34:12,702 --> 00:34:14,622
They pack the chocolates

314
00:34:14,718 --> 00:34:16,104
I load it in the van

315
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:18,052
You drive the van

316
00:34:18,142 --> 00:34:20,062
Van leaves the factory

317
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:21,958
- That's all
- Then what?

318
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:23,875
Baby will cry!

319
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:43,105
What's up?

320
00:34:45,534 --> 00:34:47,040
Where are you walking off to?

321
00:34:47,134 --> 00:34:48,520
They pack the chocolates

322
00:34:48,671 --> 00:34:52,479
You load it in the van and I drive it
Van leaves the factory

323
00:34:52,575 --> 00:34:54,375
- Then what?
- Baby will cry

324
00:34:54,462 --> 00:34:56,230
That's what I plan to check

325
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,841
After the van leaves the factory
you said the baby will cry

326
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,116
Why didn't she cry?

327
00:35:10,207 --> 00:35:13,251
You came back, that's why she won't cry

328
00:35:14,751 --> 00:35:16,868
Watch the baby cry now

329
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,389
Why is she gurgling?

330
00:35:33,856 --> 00:35:36,551
Why don't you park to the side?
What are you doing here?

331
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,666
What's he saying now?

332
00:35:38,048 --> 00:35:40,547
No, let me not repeat it
You'll feel sad

333
00:35:40,736 --> 00:35:42,788
Don't call me names in your language

334
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,452
- Wait
- What?

335
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:48,166
Tangludu!#! @#&**:>\dhaydurr!!!

336
00:35:48,256 --> 00:35:49,096
What did you say?

337
00:35:49,184 --> 00:35:49,926
You didn't understand, right?

338
00:35:50,016 --> 00:35:51,751
You get mad likewise!

339
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,314
Where are Murthy and Nlurugan?

340
00:35:54,592 --> 00:35:57,189
I said it for your good
It's your call

341
00:35:58,144 --> 00:36:00,130
Give me a straight answer

342
00:36:00,864 --> 00:36:01,824
I'm here, sir

343
00:36:02,049 --> 00:36:05,027
Why won't the chocolates be missing
if the truck is left unattended?

344
00:36:08,769 --> 00:36:10,820
Did Murthy and Nlurugan come here?

345
00:36:12,161 --> 00:36:13,667
No

346
00:36:13,857 --> 00:36:15,395
Let me know when they come

347
00:36:15,489 --> 00:36:18,216
What room is this?

348
00:36:20,577 --> 00:36:22,312
Oven?

349
00:36:27,937 --> 00:36:31,593
31 -32-33-34-35-36...

350
00:36:34,081 --> 00:36:38,020
Victor has been looking for you
I'll let him know you are here

351
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:40,230
Wait here

352
00:36:41,601 --> 00:36:44,067
Victor, do you know where Murthy is?

353
00:36:47,266 --> 00:36:53,387
- You didn't see me
- No, but I saw you now

354
00:36:56,545 --> 00:37:00,135
Tell Victor you didn't see me

355
00:37:00,225 --> 00:37:02,473
it's wrong to lie

356
00:37:03,714 --> 00:37:05,580
it's alright if it's for a good cause

357
00:37:05,666 --> 00:37:08,045
- it's wrong to lie
- Don't keep muttering the same dialog

358
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:09,516
Be clear and loud

359
00:37:11,618 --> 00:37:14,794
it's wrong to lie

360
00:37:33,155 --> 00:37:34,661
Where did you go?

361
00:37:41,091 --> 00:37:43,143
Baby has stopped crying

362
00:37:52,579 --> 00:37:57,773
You are such an idiot
How can you suspect our Krishna?

363
00:37:57,859 --> 00:38:00,806
He is so naive
How could you suspect him?

364
00:38:01,252 --> 00:38:05,704
Yesterday I got muddled
Do you think you can fool me, you thief?

365
00:38:11,267 --> 00:38:13,930
- What's so funny?
- I feel sad for you

366
00:38:14,276 --> 00:38:16,840
- Why do you feel sad for me?
- Leave it, bro!

367
00:38:16,931 --> 00:38:18,666
Tell me

368
00:38:23,395 --> 00:38:29,998
When 2 people are involved
isn't it enough if I knows what to do!?

369
00:38:35,268 --> 00:38:42,863
Say 'daddy'

370
00:38:42,948 --> 00:38:45,675
She called me 'daddy', Raji

371
00:38:53,381 --> 00:38:57,134
Look at the way he is calling her Raji
so casually in front of you!

372
00:38:59,013 --> 00:39:01,032
Stop obsessing

373
00:39:01,701 --> 00:39:04,559
She just said appa (dad)
notAmitabh Bachan?!

374
00:39:04,645 --> 00:39:07,504
Are you all jobless?

375
00:39:07,589 --> 00:39:10,317
Why are you sitting here
in this cold listening to him?

376
00:39:10,405 --> 00:39:11,791
Go home and sleep

377
00:39:12,197 --> 00:39:16,464
She called me 'daddy'

378
00:39:17,637 --> 00:39:22,799
All babies only say 'ma' first

379
00:39:23,781 --> 00:39:26,127
- But she did call me daddy!
- You are such a nitwit

380
00:39:26,213 --> 00:39:29,127
Raji, it's getting late
Come, let's go home

381
00:39:29,222 --> 00:39:32,397
- Dad
- Don't go

382
00:39:38,118 --> 00:39:42,913
A http://movieshdnow.com D VD

383
00:39:50,342 --> 00:39:56,846
This is a dad's lullaby

384
00:39:56,934 --> 00:40:02,608
Hearing her 'baby-talk'
Mother earth sparkled with greenery

385
00:40:02,694 --> 00:40:10,474
Dad doubles as mom,
in this endearing phase

386
00:40:10,566 --> 00:40:15,793
His doodles designed
a masterpiece of grace

387
00:40:15,878 --> 00:40:19,086
2 souls unite to become 1

388
00:40:22,471 --> 00:40:26,639
Lovingly he continues...all alone

389
00:40:30,215 --> 00:40:36,392
Tear drops plead for a parasol
brimming in the eye-space

390
00:40:36,487 --> 00:40:42,925
This is a father's lullaby

391
00:40:43,015 --> 00:40:49,705
Listening to this child's voice
Mother earth painted new scenery

392
00:40:50,023 --> 00:40:54,818
A http://movieshdnow.com D VD

393
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:39,344
Drops of water bonded to be born as rain

394
00:41:39,433 --> 00:41:45,871
Though rain did stop
trees drizzled again

395
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:49,801
Just a kid even if he's an adult by age

396
00:41:52,617 --> 00:41:59,121
Still a chili
she takes her mother's image!

397
00:41:59,209 --> 00:42:04,490
No other bliss can rival this happiness

398
00:42:04,585 --> 00:42:08,045
sense God only through her eyes

399
00:42:11,177 --> 00:42:15,411
Worldly wisdom this
unconditional love defies

400
00:42:18,857 --> 00:42:23,506
Tear drops urge for an umbrella
from the alcove of their eyes

401
00:42:25,929 --> 00:42:26,956
Why is the tree so tall?

402
00:42:30,825 --> 00:42:32,975
Because its dad is tall, that's why

403
00:42:33,705 --> 00:42:35,659
Why is the crow so black?

404
00:42:36,138 --> 00:42:39,411
Roaming all day, it gets tanned by the sun

405
00:42:42,091 --> 00:42:44,109
Why is the elephant so big?

406
00:42:44,971 --> 00:42:48,976
It has a HUGE appetite, that's why

407
00:42:51,946 --> 00:42:54,095
Where is mummy?

408
00:42:56,810 --> 00:42:58,196
She is with God

409
00:42:59,115 --> 00:43:02,225
Doesn't God have His own mummy?

410
00:43:08,011 --> 00:43:15,726
Victor says God likes to keep
good people by His side

411
00:43:17,931 --> 00:43:20,211
We are not good?

412
00:44:40,301 --> 00:44:41,294
Shall we return their ball?

413
00:44:46,189 --> 00:44:47,629
Do you like this school?

414
00:44:51,117 --> 00:44:53,780
Can I also play if I join this school?

415
00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:58,776
Sure, you can play and study well
You'll be a doctor 1 day

416
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:00,433
Why should I become a doctor?

417
00:45:00,845 --> 00:45:03,508
So that you can take care of your dad

418
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:12,979
Do you like this?

419
00:45:14,094 --> 00:45:18,361
Krishna...this looks used

420
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:20,911
Someone's worn it and kept it here

421
00:45:23,118 --> 00:45:25,072
You can't take all this

422
00:45:25,166 --> 00:45:27,828
Which school?

423
00:45:30,062 --> 00:45:31,764
If you don't know the school's name,
leave now

424
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:39,890
Give me the money

425
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:43,089
Take the money

426
00:45:45,487 --> 00:45:49,109
Balance?
What about balance Rs 180?

427
00:45:51,439 --> 00:45:53,392
Pay the balance and take this tomorrow

428
00:45:53,487 --> 00:45:56,914
Spoiling my day
early in the morning

429
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:09,524
Give me money, bro
Fast...we need it

430
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,095
This is all I have

431
00:46:15,695 --> 00:46:17,976
My share...my mother gave me

432
00:46:20,112 --> 00:46:21,945
Krishna, here is my share

433
00:46:22,799 --> 00:46:25,145
Is this enough?

434
00:46:27,344 --> 00:46:28,981
Balance?

435
00:46:29,071 --> 00:46:30,392
I have to give you

436
00:47:10,737 --> 00:47:12,308
Keep the bag in front

437
00:47:15,985 --> 00:47:18,331
Go in, dear!

438
00:47:51,377 --> 00:47:53,778
Sit
Must not cry

439
00:47:57,906 --> 00:47:58,964
What is your name?

440
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:02,938
Your name, please?

441
00:48:10,706 --> 00:48:11,579
What happened?

442
00:48:11,666 --> 00:48:13,499
Come down
Let's go

443
00:48:17,426 --> 00:48:19,380
Let's go home

444
00:49:12,148 --> 00:49:14,942
Krishna is here

445
00:49:15,859 --> 00:49:18,260
Nila is here

446
00:49:18,612 --> 00:49:21,078
What did he do?

447
00:49:21,172 --> 00:49:23,518
Made dosas (pancakes) so yummy

448
00:49:23,604 --> 00:49:27,194
Krishna fed Nila

449
00:49:27,284 --> 00:49:29,303
Full became Nila's tummy

450
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:32,057
Nila baby's tummy is happy?

451
00:49:38,229 --> 00:49:42,429
When will I become a doctor, daddy?

452
00:49:44,884 --> 00:49:50,296
Tomo...few days...no... many days later

453
00:49:51,093 --> 00:49:53,308
Can I take care of you
only after I become a doctor?

454
00:49:58,965 --> 00:50:00,667
Shall we play again?

455
00:50:01,653 --> 00:50:02,809
Krishna is here

456
00:50:07,669 --> 00:50:08,477
Let m e see

457
00:50:12,853 --> 00:50:15,385
Nila, what are you drawing?

458
00:50:17,013 --> 00:50:18,202
Why is your page blank?

459
00:50:18,677 --> 00:50:20,183
Why don't you do your home work daily?

460
00:50:20,533 --> 00:50:22,682
Her dad is mad

461
00:50:29,302 --> 00:50:32,608
Complete your homework from tomorrow

462
00:50:32,694 --> 00:50:35,421
Otherwise you won't be allowed
into the class...understood?

463
00:50:37,365 --> 00:50:40,159
- Kishore, where's your drawing?
- He is not mad

464
00:50:56,310 --> 00:50:58,263
- What's your name?
- Nila

465
00:50:58,423 --> 00:51:00,888
- Which class?
- Lower kindergarten

466
00:51:01,174 --> 00:51:02,233
Why are you here?

467
00:51:06,166 --> 00:51:08,120
Are you a teacher?

468
00:51:09,110 --> 00:51:10,813
Student?

469
00:51:12,503 --> 00:51:15,678
If I don't finish my home work
Ramya miss will scold me

470
00:51:15,766 --> 00:51:17,152
Your mom doesn't help you at home?

471
00:51:17,239 --> 00:51:18,297
I don't have a mummy

472
00:51:18,390 --> 00:51:20,289
- Where is she?
- With God

473
00:51:22,678 --> 00:51:26,552
- Daddy?
- Daddy...

474
00:51:32,343 --> 00:51:37,177
My dad heads not just this
but 18 schools in Tamil Nadu

475
00:51:37,271 --> 00:51:39,552
We have a different approach to education

476
00:51:40,087 --> 00:51:45,696
It isn't enough to be a teacher
You must be a parent too

477
00:51:45,912 --> 00:51:48,639
Ramya, I shouldn't see any child
standing outside the class room

478
00:51:50,327 --> 00:51:52,160
I can't get the signal here
I'll come out and talk

479
00:51:53,784 --> 00:51:54,689
I can't hear you

480
00:52:00,119 --> 00:52:02,520
- What's your name?
- Shweta

481
00:52:02,616 --> 00:52:05,278
- What are you doing here?
- This is my room

482
00:52:06,008 --> 00:52:09,118
Oh! You have a room?

483
00:52:10,232 --> 00:52:11,421
What do you do?

484
00:52:12,408 --> 00:52:13,084
Just like that

485
00:52:13,176 --> 00:52:17,944
Won't Ramya miss yell at you
if you don't do any work?

486
00:52:18,809 --> 00:52:19,867
She won't

487
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:22,044
If anyone scolds you, come and tell me

488
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:06,786
We are celebrating
1st anniversary of our school

489
00:53:06,873 --> 00:53:09,732
We will conduct story telling and
poetry recitation competition

490
00:53:09,817 --> 00:53:13,178
Correspondent has said
every child should participate!

491
00:53:14,682 --> 00:53:18,555
- Correspondent means?
- She is a big teacher

492
00:53:19,482 --> 00:53:21,501
Give me your names and contest names

493
00:53:33,402 --> 00:53:34,340
What?

494
00:53:55,290 --> 00:53:56,349
What's the matter?

495
00:53:56,442 --> 00:53:59,999
I believe a big dinosaur
has come to school

496
00:54:00,219 --> 00:54:03,198
- Dinosaur?
- One big Miss

497
00:54:05,275 --> 00:54:07,491
- Not correspondent?
- Yes

498
00:54:09,755 --> 00:54:13,825
We are supposed to tell rhymes and stories

499
00:54:13,915 --> 00:54:15,301
Will you help me?

500
00:54:19,035 --> 00:54:21,184
What do you want to be taught?
Story or rhyme?

501
00:54:22,491 --> 00:54:24,194
Which one do you know?

502
00:54:24,539 --> 00:54:25,412
Both

503
00:54:26,844 --> 00:54:30,336
Then you can yourself tell big dinosaur

504
00:54:31,067 --> 00:54:32,900
Who is big dinosaur?

505
00:54:35,099 --> 00:54:37,631
Small dinosaur is Ramya miss

506
00:54:38,171 --> 00:54:43,966
- Corres...
- Correspondent?

507
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:47,420
Correspondent is the big dinosaur

508
00:54:47,964 --> 00:54:49,666
Children are waiting to be dropped

509
00:54:50,204 --> 00:54:52,736
I'll drop Nila
Give the address to my driver

510
00:55:15,037 --> 00:55:16,477
Nila did not come

511
00:55:17,277 --> 00:55:18,663
Nila did not come
Go away

512
00:55:31,421 --> 00:55:33,505
Stop!

513
00:55:34,301 --> 00:55:36,702
Don't make me run behind you

514
00:55:45,373 --> 00:55:49,061
I've run 4 kms in school and pedaled 8 kms

515
00:55:49,150 --> 00:55:50,787
He's made me sweat even in this cold!

516
00:55:50,878 --> 00:55:52,067
Where is his daughter?

517
00:55:52,478 --> 00:55:53,983
She should have reached long ago

518
00:55:54,718 --> 00:55:56,867
Correspondent said she would drop her

519
00:55:58,173 --> 00:56:00,705
- Why didn't you say this earlier?
- I forgot

520
00:56:00,797 --> 00:56:02,565
You dim-witted guy!

521
00:56:07,838 --> 00:56:08,897
Where were you so long?

522
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:11,270
You could have given me the house key

523
00:56:12,190 --> 00:56:13,696
Her teacher waited and just now left

524
00:56:13,790 --> 00:56:15,427
Not teacher, Shweta

525
00:56:17,950 --> 00:56:20,547
- Is she angry?
- Very much

526
00:57:05,183 --> 00:57:09,832
Daddy, will you also leave me like mom?

527
00:57:09,983 --> 00:57:11,304
I will never do that

528
00:57:12,031 --> 00:57:13,733
You were the one who left me

529
00:57:13,951 --> 00:57:15,653
Do you know where all I searched for you?

530
00:57:16,191 --> 00:57:18,210
- Drivers house...school
- They didn't tell you?

531
00:57:25,248 --> 00:57:26,688
I believe I must tell a story

532
00:57:27,424 --> 00:57:29,323
That's why it got delayed

533
00:57:29,407 --> 00:57:30,728
Story?

534
00:57:32,287 --> 00:57:36,871
I'll tell you a story
But you should come back early

535
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,466
Do you know to tell a story?

536
00:57:39,648 --> 00:57:41,929
- I know plenty of stories
- Tell me

537
00:57:45,152 --> 00:57:46,658
I'll tell you tomorrow

538
00:57:48,097 --> 00:57:49,668
But you shouldn't leave me

539
00:57:49,761 --> 00:57:52,260
I feel terrible without you

540
00:57:54,880 --> 00:58:00,675
If I am missing again
tell that Nila (moon)

541
00:58:00,769 --> 00:58:03,748
That moon will tell me

542
00:58:20,097 --> 00:58:21,799
What are you doing here
without loading the stuff into the van?

543
00:58:22,721 --> 00:58:24,674
Nila has to tell a story in her school

544
00:58:24,769 --> 00:58:27,563
So Krishna has been hassling everyone

545
00:58:28,418 --> 00:58:29,989
- Who is the victim?
- You!

546
00:58:30,465 --> 00:58:32,036
How?

547
00:58:34,882 --> 00:58:37,741
I don't know any story to tell

548
00:58:37,825 --> 00:58:39,462
You must tell

549
00:58:39,938 --> 00:58:42,022
He is the root cause for all problems

550
00:58:45,057 --> 00:58:47,785
- I really don't know
- I won't let you go

551
00:58:52,290 --> 00:58:54,505
- Haven't you left for the shops?
- Haven't you?

552
00:58:58,242 --> 00:58:59,496
Tell her to tell me a story

553
00:59:00,546 --> 00:59:03,460
You want a story, right?
I'll tell you

554
00:59:03,746 --> 00:59:06,790
- Do you know to tell a story?
- I do...come

555
00:59:10,370 --> 00:59:12,290
Do you know to tell stories?

556
00:59:12,835 --> 00:59:14,667
I know many stories

557
00:59:14,882 --> 00:59:17,032
But Krishna cannot understand them

558
00:59:17,123 --> 00:59:22,404
As long as either the story teller or listener
is expressive, isn't it enough?

559
00:59:33,123 --> 00:59:34,061
Story

560
00:59:34,979 --> 00:59:37,892
How long will you be this way?

561
00:59:40,547 --> 00:59:42,696
Is this a story?

562
00:59:42,851 --> 00:59:47,946
Won't you begin with
'in a far away land'?

563
00:59:48,035 --> 00:59:50,501
Let us talk about your story

564
00:59:51,171 --> 00:59:53,070
How long can you be single?

565
00:59:53,731 --> 00:59:58,827
You are young and handsome

566
01:00:00,387 --> 01:00:01,708
Fair complexioned

567
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:04,645
You have a good set of teeth!

568
01:00:05,828 --> 01:00:08,807
Get married, so you and
Nila can be taken care of

569
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:12,970
How can he get married again?
Knowing his past story...

570
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:15,526
Nowadays which girl wants intelligence?

571
01:00:16,003 --> 01:00:18,022
They'll be happy with someone like him

572
01:00:18,564 --> 01:00:23,213
I'll find a suitable wife
to take care of you and Nila

573
01:00:26,756 --> 01:00:29,997
But Raji is there to take care

574
01:00:36,164 --> 01:00:37,550
Should I say it loud and clear?!!

575
01:00:40,068 --> 01:00:42,534
Raji is there to take care

576
01:00:52,484 --> 01:00:55,660
Krishna is here

577
01:00:55,749 --> 01:00:58,281
Nila is here

578
01:00:58,692 --> 01:01:02,631
I want to tell you a story

579
01:01:04,325 --> 01:01:05,384
Story?

580
01:01:08,229 --> 01:01:09,353
What story, daddy?

581
01:01:16,357 --> 01:01:18,758
- Which one shall I say?
- Story...for what joy?

582
01:01:18,853 --> 01:01:22,213
What if someone steals
your story and makes a movie?

583
01:01:23,717 --> 01:01:26,031
Tell her the crow story

584
01:01:28,998 --> 01:01:31,660
Which one shall I tell?

585
01:01:36,486 --> 01:01:39,913
Tell the story of the King! King of Kings!

586
01:01:41,670 --> 01:01:43,536
Tell her the story of Maestro Ilaiyarajal

587
01:01:47,558 --> 01:01:49,390
I'll tell you a royal story

...there lived a king

591
01:02:08,359 --> 01:02:11,851
- Did the king live all by himself?
- No, of course!

592
01:02:12,391 --> 01:02:16,199
He had ministers
his yes-men 4

593
01:02:16,295 --> 01:02:17,354
Side kicks??

594
01:02:18,343 --> 01:02:22,413
In a land there lived an emperor!

01:02:22,503 --> 01:02:26,704
As good as stooges,
were his ministers 4!

596

Once there was war in the country

01:02:47,399 --> 01:02:49,298
In the war everyone fought

601
01:02:49,384 --> 01:02:51,337
Amidst the fight; bombs blasted!

602
01:02:51,431 --> 01:02:52,817
Dom! Dom! Dom!

603
01:02:52,904 --> 01:02:54,988
But why fight?

604
01:02:59,368 --> 01:03:01,583
Why did the battle begin?

605
01:03:01,672 --> 01:03:04,586
Why did the battle even begin?

606
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:06,961
The crow stole a fritter...that's why

607
01:03:07,048 --> 01:03:09,001
War happened suddenly

608
01:03:09,096 --> 01:03:11,050
...because crow stole a fritter
with its beak

609
01:03:11,144 --> 01:03:14,701
Cunning fox asked the crow
to sing Do Re Me...

610
01:03:14,792 --> 01:03:16,363
Crow sang...really?

611
01:03:16,456 --> 01:03:17,580
Oh! The crow can't sing!

612
01:03:18,953 --> 01:03:23,405
Avvww...poor crow had nothing!

613
01:03:23,497 --> 01:03:25,264
You think the king will let it go?

614
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:31,659
King started to sing off-key
Fox dropped the fritter hurriedly

615
01:03:31,752 --> 01:03:36,401
Crow said Thanks, Your Majesty! '

616
01:03:36,489 --> 01:03:40,625
Entire kingdom rejoiced happily

617
01:03:40,713 --> 01:03:44,587
With his tail tucked in, the fox fled

Oh! Not another King's story!

His kingdom was troubled
by a dinosaur for long

So the people complained
to the king very strong

637
01:05:28,363 --> 01:05:32,368
As Superman, to kill this dinosaur dead

638
01:05:32,459 --> 01:05:36,333
their king should go, they requested

639
01:05:40,972 --> 01:05:45,293

All the people exclaimed
'Long live Your Majesty'!

Nila sleeps in happiness

656

I am going to sleep now

657
01:08:02,127 --> 01:08:03,567
Has Nila slept?

After No moon I believe

667
01:09:19,953 --> 01:09:21,339
Do you remember everything?

668
01:09:23,185 --> 01:09:26,044
- Should I tell both rhymes?
- Just 1 will do

669

You didn't seem to miss me
That's why

- We are engaged

01:11:25,972 --> 01:11:31,767
You go on to the stage

680
01:12:03,861 --> 01:12:07,288
We adults have a lot to learn
from these children

681
01:12:11,797 --> 01:12:14,656
Nila and Arun share the first prize

682
01:12:17,685 --> 01:12:19,006
They are calling Nila to take the prize

683
01:12:19,669 --> 01:12:25,343
We invite our correspondent
Shweta to give the prize

684
01:12:26,645 --> 01:12:28,348
Ma'am, please come to the stage

685
01:12:55,702 --> 01:12:57,786
Krishna should be the one to be thanked

686
01:12:58,262 --> 01:13:01,623
He has brought up his daughter
as innocent as him

687
01:13:08,055 --> 01:13:09,114
Can we leave?

688
01:13:10,423 --> 01:13:12,125
1 minute...we'll come

689
01:13:13,239 --> 01:13:14,493
Shall we go, Krishna?

690
01:13:14,582 --> 01:13:17,180
Who is with Nila?

691
01:13:18,295 --> 01:13:19,866
Let's leave after a while

692
01:13:20,407 --> 01:13:22,273
Nila's dad, Krishna

693
01:13:23,831 --> 01:13:25,271
Her mom?

694
01:13:25,623 --> 01:13:27,391
Bhanu is her name

695
01:13:28,311 --> 01:13:29,184
Where is she?

696
01:13:29,847 --> 01:13:31,168
She died very young

697
01:13:34,519 --> 01:13:36,473
What are you saying?

698
01:13:36,696 --> 01:13:42,937
Good or bad, she should have
married someone with sense

699
01:13:46,232 --> 01:13:48,250
He killed her through sheer neglect!

700
01:13:48,664 --> 01:13:51,577
Now this kid is stuck with him
like a garland in a monkey's hand!

701
01:13:52,375 --> 01:13:53,816
Wonder when he will kill this child?

702
01:13:54,744 --> 01:13:57,276
No one can eat or sleep
in peace thanks to him

703
01:14:01,528 --> 01:14:03,360
What are you saying?!!

704
01:14:03,448 --> 01:14:04,834
I am well aware of the facts

705
01:14:05,432 --> 01:14:11,357
Will you be okay if I drag a girl by her hand
and coochey coo her child all the time?

706
01:14:12,344 --> 01:14:13,468
Are you coming now or not?

707
01:14:33,752 --> 01:14:34,625
What happened?

708
01:14:36,249 --> 01:14:37,503
That Nila is...

709
01:14:41,561 --> 01:14:44,223
Shall we see Shweta before we leave?

710
01:14:49,881 --> 01:14:54,148
Let's go

711
01:15:04,985 --> 01:15:08,477
it's Krishna, dad
I have seen him in snaps before

712
01:15:08,825 --> 01:15:10,146
Where are you?

713
01:15:13,562 --> 01:15:15,461
Will you wait here?
I'll go inside

714
01:15:37,050 --> 01:15:39,909
I'll never call you dinosaur again

715
01:15:47,355 --> 01:15:50,214
Come Nila, let's go home

716
01:15:54,075 --> 01:15:55,842
Nila won't come
You can leave

717
01:15:56,443 --> 01:16:00,513
- Why won't she come?
- She won't

718
01:16:00,603 --> 01:16:02,687
Daddy

719
01:16:02,779 --> 01:16:06,206
- Nila, let's go home
- Dadddddy!

720
01:16:16,731 --> 01:16:17,920
Nila won't come

721
01:16:18,971 --> 01:16:20,030
Get lost

722
01:16:22,172 --> 01:16:25,729
Daddy!

723
01:16:28,059 --> 01:16:29,183
Catch him

724
01:16:30,108 --> 01:16:31,875
I'm going home

725
01:16:35,739 --> 01:16:39,875
- Give me the child
- No

726
01:16:55,772 --> 01:16:57,922
Let me go home

727
01:16:58,012 --> 01:16:59,998
Grab him
Give me the child

728
01:17:03,388 --> 01:17:04,381
Let go of Krishna

729
01:17:04,540 --> 01:17:05,664
Give me the child

730
01:17:13,692 --> 01:17:14,685
What's happening here?

731
01:17:14,781 --> 01:17:19,549
Are you all uncivilized?
Behave like humane beings!

732
01:17:34,077 --> 01:17:41,345
Bhanu is my daughter
I have searched for her everywhere

733
01:17:43,741 --> 01:17:52,034
I thought she'd be living happily
with the man she loved...somewhere

734
01:18:10,846 --> 01:18:18,376
They acted in haste
I apologize on their behalf

735
01:18:24,990 --> 01:18:33,894
Krishna and Nila are all that
I have left in my daughter's memory

736
01:18:39,263 --> 01:18:41,031
Send them with me

737
01:18:42,910 --> 01:18:46,086
I'll take care of them both

738
01:19:25,088 --> 01:19:26,026
Don't give him money

739
01:19:26,688 --> 01:19:31,751
This is Krishna's money
He earned it rightfully

740
01:19:33,728 --> 01:19:38,759
How can I ever thank you
for all that you've done?

741
01:19:38,848 --> 01:19:47,141
You are not taking with you
just 1 child but 2

742
01:20:06,369 --> 01:20:07,307
Stop the car

743
01:20:18,337 --> 01:20:19,210
Get down

744
01:20:21,665 --> 01:20:23,051
We've reached...get down

745
01:20:26,977 --> 01:20:29,258
I'll hold her for you

746
01:20:39,714 --> 01:20:40,773
Start the car

747
01:21:19,331 --> 01:21:24,678
Only medicine for Krishna is Nila

748
01:21:55,683 --> 01:21:56,491
What are you doing?

749
01:21:59,523 --> 01:22:03,146
Nila will come

750
01:22:03,940 --> 01:22:04,813
Trust me

751
01:22:06,435 --> 01:22:13,320
I'll take Krishna back with me
Admit him in a hospital there

752
01:22:13,412 --> 01:22:17,350
incidentally or accidentally I am also
to blame for Krishna's present condition

753
01:22:19,684 --> 01:22:23,241
Re-uniting Krishna and Nila
is my responsibility

754
01:22:24,228 --> 01:22:26,628
I'll take care

755
01:22:31,812 --> 01:22:32,936
Stop here

756
01:22:59,845 --> 01:23:00,969
My client

757
01:23:01,317 --> 01:23:02,987
He'll be here till my case gets over

758
01:23:06,405 --> 01:23:07,976
Is this a home or charity hall?

759
01:23:09,605 --> 01:23:10,478
Charity hall

760
01:23:34,310 --> 01:23:37,256
Rajendran, chairman of
Green valley educational trust

761
01:23:37,350 --> 01:23:40,972
Not just in Ooty, he has
14 such institutions all over Tamil Nadu

762
01:23:41,062 --> 01:23:43,212
Well known in our society

763
01:23:43,430 --> 01:23:44,751
He has 2 daughters

764
01:23:44,838 --> 01:23:47,566
Bhanumathy the eldest
rebelled against her dad

765
01:23:47,654 --> 01:23:49,487
5 years ago she got married and left home

766
01:23:49,703 --> 01:23:53,008
Youngest daughter Shweta
studied MBA in USA

767
01:23:53,094 --> 01:23:55,821
She is now correspondent
in her dad's school

768
01:24:04,807 --> 01:24:08,299
Sir, someone called Anuradha
has come to see you

769
01:24:14,855 --> 01:24:16,972
Do you need admission?

770
01:24:17,063 --> 01:24:19,660
- No, sir
- Do you want any donation?

771
01:24:21,671 --> 01:24:23,755
Fax this immediately

772
01:24:24,103 --> 01:24:27,147
I need to talk to you personally

773
01:24:27,495 --> 01:24:29,514
I'm seeing you for the 1st time now

774
01:24:29,607 --> 01:24:31,178
How can we share anything personal?

775
01:24:32,231 --> 01:24:33,104
Who?

776
01:24:34,343 --> 01:24:36,427
- Which Bhanu?
- Your eldest daughter

777
01:24:36,903 --> 01:24:38,987
I have just 1 daughter called Shweta

778
01:24:39,079 --> 01:24:40,268
Why are you lying?

779
01:24:40,359 --> 01:24:42,575
There's no necessity for me to lie

780
01:24:42,663 --> 01:24:44,049
Look at me and speak

781
01:24:45,064 --> 01:24:47,017
Nila is with you

782
01:24:47,496 --> 01:24:49,711
There's no one by the name Nila here

783
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,914
Where is Nila?

784
01:25:04,776 --> 01:25:09,098
She's up...go

785
01:25:15,593 --> 01:25:16,978
Where are you going?

786
01:25:18,344 --> 01:25:24,302
- Stop, you shouldn't go there
- Nila is there, let me go see her

787
01:25:27,017 --> 01:25:29,876
Who is this?

788
01:25:31,432 --> 01:25:35,121
Stop there

789
01:25:35,208 --> 01:25:38,187
Nila is up

790
01:25:41,673 --> 01:25:44,816
I want my Nila

791
01:25:47,497 --> 01:25:48,556
Take your hands off

792
01:25:48,841 --> 01:25:52,082
- Get out from here
- I want my Nila

793
01:25:54,185 --> 01:25:55,691
Don't you dare hit him
Take us to Nila

794
01:25:55,785 --> 01:25:58,644
I am being nice to you
because you are a female

795
01:25:59,306 --> 01:26:00,943
I want Nila

796
01:26:01,033 --> 01:26:02,539
Are you deliberately
making trouble for me?

797
01:26:02,634 --> 01:26:03,693
You separated a daughter and dad,

798
01:26:03,786 --> 01:26:06,001
...left him on the roads
and now claim innocence?

799
01:26:06,089 --> 01:26:08,883
Who are you to question me?
How are you connected to him?

800
01:26:09,994 --> 01:26:11,947
I am a lawyer
Krishna is innocent

801
01:26:12,042 --> 01:26:15,348
Then file a case in the court
Don't create a ruckus here

802
01:26:30,762 --> 01:26:31,722
What did you do?

803
01:26:33,098 --> 01:26:35,696
Habeas corpus
Writ petition

804
01:26:36,938 --> 01:26:41,325
They have to bring Nila
to the court wherever she may be

805
01:26:41,418 --> 01:26:43,186
Do you know whom
we are crossing swords with?

806
01:26:43,274 --> 01:26:45,358
Can we compete with his money
or man power?

807
01:26:45,450 --> 01:26:47,404
No, we can't
That's why

808
01:26:53,515 --> 01:26:55,796
- Can we meet Mr Rajendran?
- Please take a seat

809
01:26:58,699 --> 01:26:59,757
What are you doing here?

810
01:27:01,003 --> 01:27:02,803
When will my daddy come?

811
01:27:02,891 --> 01:27:04,790
You know he's not well

812
01:27:05,323 --> 01:27:06,894
As soon as he gets better he'll be here

813
01:27:06,987 --> 01:27:11,188
When will he get better?
When will he come?

814
01:27:15,435 --> 01:27:16,428
Tomorrow

815
01:27:16,523 --> 01:27:19,764
This is your reply everyday
When will he really come?

816
01:27:20,427 --> 01:27:21,682
Tomorrow
Positively

817
01:27:21,771 --> 01:27:23,725
Sir, someone has come to see you

818
01:27:24,011 --> 01:27:25,517
This is an order from the High court

819
01:27:25,739 --> 01:27:27,507
We came in person since it concerns YOU!

820
01:27:27,660 --> 01:27:29,809
If you let us know how to handle this

821
01:27:32,460 --> 01:27:33,649
Why are you here?

822
01:27:33,868 --> 01:27:39,062
Do you need a lawyer?
I am sorry I cannot oblige

823
01:27:39,148 --> 01:27:40,916
Withdraw the case you are handling now

824
01:27:41,004 --> 01:27:42,837
Why? What happened?

825
01:27:42,924 --> 01:27:44,430
You were prepared to meet me in the court

826
01:27:44,844 --> 01:27:45,782
We'll meet there just as you said

827
01:27:45,868 --> 01:27:48,149
There's no justice
in the case that you are handling

828
01:27:48,236 --> 01:27:49,360
What's justice?

829
01:27:50,220 --> 01:27:53,013
You broke a lovely home
Is that fair?

830
01:27:53,612 --> 01:27:56,656
You separated a dad and his daughter?
Is that right?

831
01:27:57,196 --> 01:27:59,411
Do you know the anguish of that affection?

832
01:27:59,500 --> 01:28:01,454
You are asking me about affection?

833
01:28:01,548 --> 01:28:04,789
No one can feel that pain more than me

834
01:28:09,517 --> 01:28:13,522
My eldest daughter
never wanted to get married

835
01:28:13,612 --> 01:28:15,566
Social service was her life

836
01:28:16,044 --> 01:28:18,641
When she told me she loved someone

837
01:28:18,733 --> 01:28:20,565
instead of objecting
like most dads would do...

838
01:28:20,653 --> 01:28:23,118
I was the one who with great joy
told her to bring him home

839
01:28:24,365 --> 01:28:27,159
But she brought home a man like him!

840
01:28:27,245 --> 01:28:30,868
No dad in the world would agree

841
01:28:31,213 --> 01:28:37,716
She chose him over my money,
dignity, status, love

842
01:28:38,701 --> 01:28:40,272
Where is she today?

843
01:28:46,221 --> 01:28:49,648
Do you want me to lose Nila too?

844
01:28:53,133 --> 01:28:55,152
You are talking about 1 whose life is over

845
01:28:55,374 --> 01:28:57,011
I am talking of those who are still alive

846
01:28:57,102 --> 01:29:00,910
- Whomever...
- We'll discuss the rest in court

847
01:29:03,374 --> 01:29:07,958
I did not come here
fearing you or this case

848
01:29:08,750 --> 01:29:13,911
Your case won't hold water
even in Supreme court!

849
01:29:17,198 --> 01:29:20,276
This case is not a cake walk, like you think

850
01:29:21,198 --> 01:29:25,334
Law does not support a mentally unstable
parent to bring up his or her child

851
01:29:26,126 --> 01:29:29,170
- I am aware
- Then why do you want to take up this case?

852
01:29:29,262 --> 01:29:33,071
Neither will we win nor get money
On top of it, habeas corpus

853
01:29:33,679 --> 01:29:35,065
I've promised Krishna

854
01:29:35,982 --> 01:29:37,619
I'd get Nila back for him

855
01:29:38,927 --> 01:29:40,432
I don't know if I'll succeed

856
01:29:42,639 --> 01:29:45,498
At least I should make them meet

857
01:29:46,575 --> 01:29:47,863
Krishna is here

858
01:29:48,015 --> 01:29:54,551
If you tell me where Nila is,
I'll go find her

859
01:29:55,728 --> 01:29:58,193
What are you doing?

860
01:29:58,352 --> 01:30:00,436
I'm talking to my daddy

861
01:30:02,767 --> 01:30:09,074
Nila said if I talk to this Nila (moon)
it will be our messenger

862
01:30:09,743 --> 01:30:13,170
- Did you eat?
- No

863
01:30:13,519 --> 01:30:14,960
Come, let's eat

864
01:30:15,056 --> 01:30:16,561
When will Nila come?

865
01:30:16,784 --> 01:30:18,803
When will my daddy come?

866
01:30:19,023 --> 01:30:21,107
Tomorrow you can see Nila during the day

867
01:30:36,592 --> 01:30:37,716
What's the time?

868
01:30:38,704 --> 01:30:41,050
As if you'll understand!

869
01:30:42,161 --> 01:30:45,969
Nila will come
I want to see Nila

870
01:30:46,064 --> 01:30:48,596
Even Neil Armstrong who went
to the moon wouldn't be so obsessed!

871
01:30:48,688 --> 01:30:50,772
You've been bugging me from last night

872
01:30:50,864 --> 01:30:52,053
Wait, she'll come

873
01:30:53,808 --> 01:30:57,562
What's in the basket?

874
01:30:58,032 --> 01:31:02,200
For Nila
Food, biscuit and sweater

875
01:31:03,633 --> 01:31:04,626
Sweater for her too?

876
01:31:12,209 --> 01:31:13,715
Mr Bashyam?!

877
01:31:14,129 --> 01:31:16,595
He can make even a normal guy loony!

878
01:31:20,657 --> 01:31:21,530
Where's the child?

879
01:31:23,217 --> 01:31:26,971
It isn't necessary to bring
the child as she is a minor

880
01:31:29,617 --> 01:31:30,806
What do we do now?

881
01:31:32,561 --> 01:31:35,769
You escort Krishna out

882
01:31:39,442 --> 01:31:42,519
Come with me

883
01:31:51,378 --> 01:31:55,187
Who is this new kiddo?
I have never seen her before

884
01:31:55,282 --> 01:31:59,155
She used to be a spectator
Now she's a lawyer!

885
01:32:02,066 --> 01:32:07,893
In spite of habeas corpus
Nila has not been brought to court

886
01:32:07,986 --> 01:32:10,551
This is a disgrace to our law and justice

887
01:32:14,546 --> 01:32:21,301
A pip squeak 2 cases old is questioning
my 20 years experience, My Lord!

888
01:32:21,395 --> 01:32:23,927
If it is so funny why should
they be scared to bring the child?

889
01:32:24,979 --> 01:32:27,260
Mr Bashyam, why hasn't
the child been brought to court?

890
01:32:28,691 --> 01:32:31,801
Lily client Mr Rajendran
is the child's legal guardian

891
01:32:32,083 --> 01:32:37,561
According to section #7
I submit this petition

892
01:32:42,579 --> 01:32:44,696
When the child's biological father is alive,

893
01:32:44,788 --> 01:32:46,555
how can someone else be her legal guardian?

894
01:32:46,643 --> 01:32:49,502
It's true her father exists
But in what state?

895
01:32:49,715 --> 01:32:52,759
What's wrong with him?
He is fine

896
01:32:53,876 --> 01:32:56,091
The child's father is mentally retarded

897
01:32:57,139 --> 01:32:58,263
Who told you that?

898
01:32:58,355 --> 01:32:59,348
Who needs to tell?

899
01:32:59,444 --> 01:33:01,593
Have you seen him?
Do you have any proof?

900
01:33:10,644 --> 01:33:13,885
He not only disrespects the court
but also my petitioner

901
01:33:14,036 --> 01:33:17,942
My petitioner Mr Krishna
is just like one of us

902
01:33:18,100 --> 01:33:22,170
He runs a chocolate factory in Ooty

903
01:33:22,516 --> 01:33:25,943
I object strongly to my client
being falsely accused

904
01:33:32,373 --> 01:33:36,475
Not sufficient if you grow tall enough
to hit your head in the front porch!

905
01:33:37,108 --> 01:33:39,706
The way you piled on objections
I almost got a heart attack

906
01:33:39,797 --> 01:33:44,892
Think back to the times we waited endlessly
to apprentice as Bashyam's junior?

907
01:33:44,980 --> 01:33:47,578
Like Vino said, he'll make
a normal person go nuts!

908
01:33:47,669 --> 01:33:50,201
If they see Krishna
our case goes for a toss!

909
01:33:50,293 --> 01:33:55,356
- Will Nila come there?
- This is enough!

910
01:33:55,445 --> 01:33:56,765
It wasn't deliberately said

911
01:33:56,949 --> 01:33:59,098
That's what I could think of
at that spur of the moment

912
01:33:59,221 --> 01:34:01,982
You could have asked for an adjournment
claiming your tummy was cart wheeling!

913
01:34:02,069 --> 01:34:03,095
You've stated the impossible

914
01:34:03,381 --> 01:34:07,648
Shall we get a certificate
from the doctor that Anu is unstable?!

915
01:34:07,733 --> 01:34:09,119
I can't think of any other

916
01:34:09,270 --> 01:34:10,623
There's a way if you are willing

917
01:34:29,910 --> 01:34:31,809
You sent a message to him from her number?

918
01:34:32,022 --> 01:34:33,014
With a kiss emoticon

919
01:34:36,758 --> 01:34:40,250
I've been waiting
from our college days for this

920
01:34:42,006 --> 01:34:44,865
My job's gone

921
01:34:45,974 --> 01:34:49,596
Anu told me not to work with her

922
01:34:49,814 --> 01:34:53,120
I've been warning you
from college days not to befriend her

923
01:34:53,206 --> 01:34:54,909
She's as useless as a pumpkin

924
01:34:55,670 --> 01:34:58,169
Come with me right now
I'll ask Bashyam to take you as his junior

925
01:34:58,262 --> 01:35:00,445
I have a lot of clout there

926
01:35:01,815 --> 01:35:05,121
Mr Bashyam doesn't even know his name
Snooty scoundrel

927
01:35:05,207 --> 01:35:06,396
Let me plaster his face with sand

928
01:35:09,239 --> 01:35:09,981
What happened?

929
01:35:14,295 --> 01:35:16,827
I can't leave Anu

930
01:35:17,111 --> 01:35:18,170
Why?

931
01:35:18,327 --> 01:35:21,241
She hasn't paid me for 5 months

932
01:35:22,615 --> 01:35:27,580
Unless we win Nila's case
I won't get my salary

933
01:35:28,663 --> 01:35:31,424
it's my responsibility to help you

934
01:35:31,511 --> 01:35:35,647
We will win

935
01:35:40,376 --> 01:35:42,908
if Krishna is mentally challenged
as you claim...

936
01:35:43,960 --> 01:35:45,346
...they can't go beyond the 1st hearing

937
01:35:45,431 --> 01:35:47,264
I don't claim
It is a fact

938
01:35:50,552 --> 01:35:52,384
it's tough to convert truth into a lie

939
01:35:52,536 --> 01:35:53,857
it's easy to make truth out of truth

940
01:36:03,256 --> 01:36:04,315
Where's Krishna?

941
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:07,459
Am I the watchman of this house
to check who is in and who is out?

942
01:36:07,544 --> 01:36:08,898
Is anyone asking me permission to live here?

943
01:36:15,448 --> 01:36:19,715
I told you, he'd be here

944
01:36:26,360 --> 01:36:27,419
What are you doing here?

945
01:36:28,409 --> 01:36:32,163
Isn't Nila here?

946
01:36:33,401 --> 01:36:34,787
Case is still not over

947
01:36:35,385 --> 01:36:38,691
If anyone sees you here now
you will never get Nila

948
01:36:42,777 --> 01:36:45,277
I shouldn't come here?

949
01:36:45,369 --> 01:36:46,875
Do you want Nila or not?

950
01:36:50,169 --> 01:36:52,123
You cannot come here without my knowledge

951
01:36:53,753 --> 01:36:59,231
I won't come here after

952
01:37:07,993 --> 01:37:10,012
Won’t just 'on the way' do?
Why add a suffix 'dear'?

953
01:37:11,706 --> 01:37:13,211
I can't stand him

954
01:37:17,626 --> 01:37:18,368
What happened?

955
01:37:19,674 --> 01:37:21,441
So long to remove a sweater?

956
01:37:22,298 --> 01:37:24,382
I've been trying for past
2 hours to remove it

957
01:37:24,474 --> 01:37:27,420
He's holding on to it like
it's an appendage to his body!

958
01:37:27,514 --> 01:37:28,452
1 last try

959
01:37:50,746 --> 01:37:53,987
Only his brain is weak
Rest of his body is strong as an ox

960
01:37:59,195 --> 01:38:01,727
I am such a lion king
I couldn't accomplish it

961
01:38:02,907 --> 01:38:03,900
Go man

962
01:38:05,403 --> 01:38:07,749
lama lion king

963
01:38:27,868 --> 01:38:31,392
- My name is Kris
- Don't lift your hand

964
01:38:31,484 --> 01:38:34,976
My name is Krishna,Avalanchi, Ooty
Repeat that

965
01:38:39,292 --> 01:38:41,889
You think you are a composer
conducting a concert?

966
01:38:41,980 --> 01:38:44,642
So much fuss to pronounce
such a simple name as Krishna!

967
01:38:46,268 --> 01:38:47,708
This is our first test

968
01:38:47,804 --> 01:38:52,550
If we convince the examining doctor
rest of it is a cake walk

969
01:38:53,980 --> 01:38:56,326
You are way too optimistic!

970
01:39:01,821 --> 01:39:08,389
A normal man should have an IQ above 90

971
01:39:08,477 --> 01:39:12,831
Anything less than that
is considered mentally challenged

972
01:39:12,925 --> 01:39:20,487
So Krishna should get
90+ in tomorrow's IQ test

973
01:39:26,333 --> 01:39:30,022
Can't you give us the questions before hand?

974
01:39:52,190 --> 01:39:53,608
Tomorrow's certificate?

975
01:39:53,694 --> 01:39:56,869
We should never lie to a doctor or a lawyer

976
01:39:56,957 --> 01:40:00,068
But a doctor or lawyer can lie!

977
01:40:10,174 --> 01:40:10,916
Who is the person?

978
01:40:11,006 --> 01:40:11,944
He is seated over there

979
01:40:15,710 --> 01:40:17,663
Give me 5 minutes time
I'll get organized and then call you

980
01:40:18,271 --> 01:40:19,492
Go and get his details

981
01:40:19,935 --> 01:40:21,059
Tell me your details

982
01:40:23,775 --> 01:40:25,542
Who is the one who came now?

983
01:40:27,742 --> 01:40:29,696
Dr Basheer who will conduct the IQ test now

984
01:40:30,303 --> 01:40:32,136
What about Dr Ramana Rao?

985
01:40:32,223 --> 01:40:35,813
He's flat after drinking
some liquor doled out last night

986
01:40:35,903 --> 01:40:36,929
Today he is attending all cases

987
01:40:41,215 --> 01:40:42,121
What can I do?

988
01:40:42,207 --> 01:40:44,226
You arranged everything
You have to set right this mess

989
01:40:44,319 --> 01:40:46,272
Serves me right to have helped you!
Find someone else

990
01:40:53,791 --> 01:40:56,519
Can we bribe the new doc?

991
01:40:56,703 --> 01:40:58,787
- That's the hassle
- Why?

992
01:40:59,200 --> 01:41:02,953
He cannot be tempted
He is very straight forward

993
01:41:03,935 --> 01:41:05,256
Any other...

994
01:41:05,343 --> 01:41:11,138
He loves his wife dearly
Just like us!

995
01:41:11,231 --> 01:41:12,420
Then you have to surrender

996
01:41:17,536 --> 01:41:18,441
Who are you?

997
01:41:18,976 --> 01:41:21,834
- Mr Bashyam's junior
- He sent me

998
01:41:24,736 --> 01:41:25,608
What are you doing?

999
01:41:25,696 --> 01:41:27,463
Mr Bashyam asked me to give you

1000
01:41:27,551 --> 01:41:30,465
Give what? What's the matter?

1001
01:41:32,288 --> 01:41:36,740
Krishna, a patient will have his IQ tested

1002
01:41:36,832 --> 01:41:40,968
You should certify him as mentally challenged
with IQ level below 50

1003
01:41:41,216 --> 01:41:42,853
That's why I was sent

1004
01:41:43,392 --> 01:41:46,055
You think you can buy me with your money?

1005
01:41:46,145 --> 01:41:47,978
Do you know who I am?

1006
01:41:48,065 --> 01:41:49,451
Whom do you think you are talking to?

1007
01:41:49,665 --> 01:41:50,953
Hey! Who let him in?

1008
01:41:51,360 --> 01:41:53,259
How dare he pretend to be righteous?

1009
01:41:53,345 --> 01:41:55,177
If my boss gets to know this...

1010
01:41:55,265 --> 01:41:58,058
This is Mr Bashyam's case
Don't get stressed out

1011
01:41:58,145 --> 01:42:00,971
If you don't oblige you'll be in a soup

1012
01:42:01,056 --> 01:42:03,654
Are you working for the Government or them?

1013
01:42:03,745 --> 01:42:04,934
I'll bash you!

1014
01:42:05,025 --> 01:42:07,884
Will you give me the certificate
or shall I write it myself?

1015
01:42:07,969 --> 01:42:11,330
- I dare you to do it
- Will you meet Mr Bashyam?

1016
01:42:11,425 --> 01:42:15,113
Who the hell is Bashyam?
Get up

1017
01:42:16,929 --> 01:42:20,039
I am not a puppet on a string
for Bashyam to play with?!

1018
01:42:36,450 --> 01:42:41,283
Learned advocate has fraudulently
submitted a forged document

1019
01:42:43,201 --> 01:42:46,890
It is ridiculous that...

1020
01:42:46,978 --> 01:42:50,405
...a lawyer with 20 years of experience
claims a govt. document to be forged

1021
01:42:54,210 --> 01:42:56,610
If that be the case,
last year on February 7th

1022
01:42:56,706 --> 01:42:58,987
...he produced a document
in the divorce case of Kumar and Sandhya

1023
01:42:59,074 --> 01:43:02,053
It proclaimed Sandhya to be mentally ill

1024
01:43:02,146 --> 01:43:03,564
Is that a fake document?

1025
01:43:09,890 --> 01:43:13,382
In 2008, he proclaimed
Arul Murthy as mentally ill

1026
01:43:13,474 --> 01:43:16,715
in a drunken driving case,
involving 4 people

1027
01:43:16,802 --> 01:43:18,024
Is that a forged document?

1028
01:43:21,763 --> 01:43:22,635
This is the proof

1029
01:43:25,890 --> 01:43:29,382
Oh! She beat her teacher hollow!

1030
01:43:30,307 --> 01:43:33,068
This is the twist in our tale!

1031
01:43:34,691 --> 01:43:37,418
If he agrees to have
those cases take an IQ test

1032
01:43:37,763 --> 01:43:39,912
I'll agree to have my client tested

1033
01:43:47,267 --> 01:43:49,035
Her document can be accepted

1034
01:43:52,964 --> 01:43:54,917
My petitioner is a good father

1035
01:43:55,268 --> 01:43:57,668
He has brought up Nila
for 5 years with tender loving care

1036
01:43:57,764 --> 01:43:59,085
He is traumatized now

1037
01:43:59,940 --> 01:44:03,945
I humbly request this
IQ report be considered

1038
01:44:04,035 --> 01:44:08,236
as enough evidence
to unite Nila and Krishna

1039
01:44:09,604 --> 01:44:12,844
Since the case is still in court,

1040
01:44:12,932 --> 01:44:16,937
either in a common place
or court premises

1041
01:44:17,028 --> 01:44:20,268
I allow Krishna to meet
his daughter on Friday for an hour

1042
01:44:26,372 --> 01:44:29,198
If Nila comes to court
it will be a big fiasco

1043
01:44:29,924 --> 01:44:34,311
It will not be an obstacle for us
It will be a debacle for them

1044
01:44:35,493 --> 01:44:38,603
As long as Krishna is hidden they win

1045
01:44:39,204 --> 01:44:41,256
If Krishna comes to court they lose

1046
01:44:42,181 --> 01:44:44,135
Their reunion is advantageous to us

1047
01:44:45,124 --> 01:44:46,314
What if Nila meets Krishna?

1048
01:44:46,405 --> 01:44:50,061
Nila will come to court
But she won't meet Krishna

1049
01:44:50,597 --> 01:44:54,536
Krishna has to face me and this world

1050
01:44:59,941 --> 01:45:01,130
What are you doing?

1051
01:45:05,189 --> 01:45:08,878
Nila loves rice mixed with milk

1052
01:45:12,261 --> 01:45:13,832
Nila is really blessed

1053
01:45:15,557 --> 01:45:17,128
to get a dad like you

1054
01:45:18,373 --> 01:45:20,206
I am a good dad?!

1055
01:45:37,542 --> 01:45:38,415
What's happening?

1056
01:45:40,038 --> 01:45:42,897
Mr Bashyam is here
They have come with the child

1057
01:45:43,814 --> 01:45:45,255
Waiting to meet Krishna

1058
01:45:45,670 --> 01:45:47,373
I'll be there

1059
01:45:53,927 --> 01:45:56,327
- How much longer?
- We'll be there soon

1060
01:45:57,447 --> 01:45:59,792
Looks like an accident
Let me go check

1061
01:46:00,262 --> 01:46:03,176
How recklessly you drove!

1062
01:46:21,672 --> 01:46:25,327
It's Mr Bashyam's men
who are creating the traffic jam

1063
01:46:26,951 --> 01:46:28,337
I'll bring Krishna

1064
01:46:29,959 --> 01:46:31,726
- Come
- Come

1065
01:46:33,671 --> 01:46:34,893
No, this side

1066
01:46:40,679 --> 01:46:42,284
We are going to see Nila

1067
01:46:43,144 --> 01:46:45,425
- Do you want any food?
- I don't want

1068
01:46:45,512 --> 01:46:47,978
- Call Anu, quick
- Nluruga, look over there

1069
01:46:49,544 --> 01:46:54,956
Anu, bring Krishna to the car park
without Mr Bashyam's knowledge

1070
01:46:55,336 --> 01:46:56,656
I am Nlurugan speaking

1071
01:46:56,744 --> 01:46:59,570
Krishna and his lawyer are coming
to the car park to see Nila

1072
01:46:59,784 --> 01:47:01,104
Her assistant is here

1073
01:47:05,416 --> 01:47:06,409
We have 2 more minutes

1074
01:47:18,888 --> 01:47:20,012
Come soon

1075
01:47:27,785 --> 01:47:29,105
it's getting late

1076
01:47:30,857 --> 01:47:31,915
Nila will leave

1077
01:47:33,576 --> 01:47:34,569
What are you doing?

1078
01:47:46,345 --> 01:47:47,535
Let's go

1079
01:47:57,033 --> 01:47:58,900
They are heading towards
the car park to see Nila

1080
01:47:59,049 --> 01:48:04,527
Relax! I'll take care
Escort him to the car park

1081
01:48:16,554 --> 01:48:18,191
Anu, why are you so late?

1082
01:48:18,730 --> 01:48:20,335
- Where's Nila?
- They just took her this way

1083
01:48:20,426 --> 01:48:21,364
Where have they gone?

1084
01:48:22,986 --> 01:48:25,714
- Where is Mr Bashyam?
- As per our plan, Krishna...

1085
01:48:32,779 --> 01:48:34,677
- Where are they?
- They were here just now

1086
01:49:21,803 --> 01:49:23,221
Krishna is at the rear entrance

1087
01:49:48,429 --> 01:49:51,190
You came to relieve yourself
But didn't go in

1088
01:49:52,236 --> 01:49:54,517
Yeah! I came to relieve myself
But it can wait

1089
01:49:59,148 --> 01:50:02,837
I didn't intend to
But I can't hold on for long

1090
01:50:16,013 --> 01:50:17,072
Mr Bashyam?

1091
01:50:18,317 --> 01:50:20,783
I am Nlurthy, Avalanchi

1092
01:50:20,877 --> 01:50:22,382
- We spoke over the phone
- Tell me

1093
01:50:22,477 --> 01:50:25,074
As per your request
I've brought Krishna's friends

1094
01:50:25,165 --> 01:50:26,703
They are all as loony as him

1095
01:50:26,797 --> 01:50:29,459
If you take them to court,
you'll come thumbs up!

1096
01:50:29,549 --> 01:50:34,711
Judge will finish this case
in our favor in a jiffy!

1097
01:50:36,909 --> 01:50:39,375
Be ready at 9:00 A.M tomorrow
I'll send a car

1098
01:50:43,246 --> 01:50:45,908
For no reason should anyone
step out of the room

1099
01:50:48,846 --> 01:50:52,272
That Bashyam has an extra
long nose and brain

1100
01:50:52,366 --> 01:50:55,726
I knew he'd do something crooked like this

1101
01:50:59,470 --> 01:51:02,744
We should somehow
convince Nlurthy before day break

1102
01:51:03,982 --> 01:51:06,447
Can we call the hotel
and find out the room #?

1103
01:51:06,542 --> 01:51:10,383
Room may not be booked in their names

1104
01:51:10,670 --> 01:51:13,016
Do you expect us to knock on all doors!?!

1105
01:51:14,190 --> 01:51:15,249
Just 1 clue

1106
01:51:16,495 --> 01:51:19,670
All floors are occupied by tennis players

1107
01:51:19,758 --> 01:51:22,104
Others have been allotted rooms
only in the 4th floor

1108
01:51:22,191 --> 01:51:25,049
So we need to check only the 4th floor

1109
01:51:30,350 --> 01:51:36,505
Whoever recognizes Krishna
and vice versa they are 'them'!

1110
01:51:36,591 --> 01:51:38,610
- 'They' are who?
- 'Them'!

1111
01:51:45,327 --> 01:51:46,353
What do you want?

1112
01:51:48,047 --> 01:51:49,684
Why do you keep repeating?

1113
01:51:49,775 --> 01:51:52,274
Why are you hassled hearing it just twice?

1114
01:51:52,367 --> 01:51:54,768
We've heard it 2000 times! Be patient

1115
01:52:00,048 --> 01:52:06,518
When the next door opens
just check if your friends are in

1116
01:52:07,568 --> 01:52:08,626
Don't ask for Nila

1117
01:52:12,208 --> 01:52:13,015
Who the hell are you?

1118
01:52:13,103 --> 01:52:14,577
Why do you knock
at such an unearthly hour?

1119
01:52:14,896 --> 01:52:16,467
What are you gaping at?
Didn't you knock at my door?

1120
01:52:17,968 --> 01:52:19,539
Then, who did?

1121
01:52:24,560 --> 01:52:26,644
Not Anu, he did

1122
01:52:26,736 --> 01:52:28,306
Didn't you knock?
He's asking for you

1123
01:52:28,912 --> 01:52:31,127
Why did you disturb me
at this time of night for?

1124
01:52:32,656 --> 01:52:34,162
- Moon
- What?

1125
01:52:36,048 --> 01:52:37,489
Little...

1126
01:52:37,584 --> 01:52:39,222
Is that so?

1127
01:52:39,728 --> 01:52:43,863
That's why...let him go...poor guy

1128
01:52:46,960 --> 01:52:48,466
Take good care of him

1129
01:52:49,584 --> 01:52:52,312
You should not mention Nila's name
Anu, tell him

1130
01:52:52,401 --> 01:52:53,874
What's happening here?

1131
01:52:55,121 --> 01:52:57,270
- I didn't know how to tackle that guy
- Let's ask this waiter

1132
01:53:01,648 --> 01:53:03,798
Don't be stupid
What if it boomerangs on us?

1133
01:53:03,889 --> 01:53:07,642
Mr Sweater won't tell,
we don't know the room

1134
01:53:07,729 --> 01:53:10,129
I shouldn't ask the waiter,
you'll call me a nut-case

1135
01:53:10,225 --> 01:53:11,666
Do you think I can be used and thrown?

1136
01:53:11,761 --> 01:53:13,398
Search all you want without me

1137
01:53:15,538 --> 01:53:18,582
We don't need Vino
Let's go

1138
01:53:31,154 --> 01:53:33,882
Is it an IPL cricket match for me
to give a constant update?

1139
01:53:33,970 --> 01:53:37,778
We have to hunt for loonies
Very soon I'll go mad

1140
01:53:39,634 --> 01:53:41,020
Sit down

1141
01:53:46,226 --> 01:53:51,289
Something is fishy
Let's leave

1142
01:53:59,474 --> 01:54:01,875
Bashyam has kept them hidden somewhere

1143
01:54:01,971 --> 01:54:05,844
If only I catch them I'll squeeze them dry

1144
01:54:05,938 --> 01:54:07,411
Wrong place to talk over the phone

1145
01:54:09,299 --> 01:54:12,026
Giant robots are besieging me

1146
01:54:13,010 --> 01:54:14,331
Where are these 2?

1147
01:54:18,035 --> 01:54:21,341
Did you see 2 people kind-of-loony?

1148
01:54:21,811 --> 01:54:23,099
Not that side

1149
01:54:23,891 --> 01:54:24,950
Where did they go?

1150
01:54:38,356 --> 01:54:41,051
Why were you standing in the corridor
if you came to see a guest?

1151
01:54:41,139 --> 01:54:44,249
Not me...she...

1152
01:54:44,979 --> 01:54:47,576
We forgot the room #

1153
01:54:47,667 --> 01:54:48,988
You could have inquired at the reception

1154
01:54:57,875 --> 01:54:59,381
We came to see him

1155
01:55:00,724 --> 01:55:01,531
He's gone

1156
01:55:15,764 --> 01:55:25,083
Did you see a slightly loony guy
walking this way with a lady?

1157
01:55:27,061 --> 01:55:28,960
Stop hassling me!

1158
01:55:41,172 --> 01:55:44,566
Did you see a slightly loony guy
walking this way?

1159
01:55:45,749 --> 01:55:49,241
God knows where they have gone!

1160
01:55:50,677 --> 01:55:52,892
Looks like our Nlurthy

1161
01:55:52,981 --> 01:55:56,473
Why are you here?
Where are the other 2?

1162
01:55:56,565 --> 01:55:58,715
Pink cotton candy

1163
01:56:00,853 --> 01:56:05,240
Nlurthy, Big eye Jo, Karthi

1164
01:56:19,798 --> 01:56:22,198
Where are you?
How long will I hunt for you?

1165
01:56:22,293 --> 01:56:25,120
Murthy's going up

1166
01:56:28,726 --> 01:56:31,126
There's no one by the name Nlurthy here

1167
01:56:31,222 --> 01:56:32,728
What were you doing in the corridor?

1168
01:56:32,822 --> 01:56:34,262
Tell me the truth

1169
01:56:34,422 --> 01:56:36,767
UP
Down

1170
01:56:37,302 --> 01:56:39,222
He's in the lift

1171
01:56:42,390 --> 01:56:44,158
He's in the 4th floor

1172
01:56:44,246 --> 01:56:45,785
Checked shirt
Buck teeth

1173
01:56:45,879 --> 01:56:49,817
- He's Nlurthy
- He's going into the room

1174
01:56:59,063 --> 01:57:06,079
He's gone into the room
He has shut the door

1175
01:57:06,358 --> 01:57:08,737
Where did you all go?
Where are the other 2?

1176
01:57:13,303 --> 01:57:16,696
There are 2 people here
claiming to be your guests

1177
01:57:16,791 --> 01:57:19,137
- Yes...yes, sir
- Your guests?

1178
01:57:19,223 --> 01:57:20,282
They are my guests

1179
01:57:20,375 --> 01:57:22,524
They are of unsound mind

1180
01:57:23,703 --> 01:57:26,813
Keep them with you

1181
01:57:30,775 --> 01:57:33,885
Don't open the door whoever knocks

1182
01:57:35,255 --> 01:57:38,234
Turn right

1183
01:57:45,048 --> 01:57:48,126
Checked shirt
Buck teeth

1184
01:58:03,608 --> 01:58:06,881
He's forecasting a weather report
for a rain that won't shower!

1185
01:58:14,392 --> 01:58:16,477
You said they won't come
Who is that?

1186
01:58:20,665 --> 01:58:22,531
- I told him
- Whom did you tell?

1187
01:58:22,616 --> 01:58:27,003
Nlurthy, let them tell
only what they have been tutored

1188
01:58:27,096 --> 01:58:30,402
Damn! This JCB toothed guy is Nlurthy

1189
01:58:30,488 --> 01:58:32,126
Not that shovel mouthed smarty!

1190
01:58:32,921 --> 01:58:36,031
What do we do now?

1191
01:58:38,041 --> 01:58:39,296
Do you know Krishna?

1192
01:58:39,385 --> 01:58:41,949
Oh yeah! Krishna is my friend

1193
01:58:42,041 --> 01:58:46,363
We...Nila...foot ball ground

1194
01:58:46,457 --> 01:58:48,857
...we bought pink colored shoes for her

1195
01:58:54,649 --> 01:58:59,450
The whole truth and nothing but the truth

1196
01:59:03,129 --> 01:59:06,305
After nodding his head
like a buffalo he's tongue-tied now

1197
01:59:10,297 --> 01:59:12,196
The whole truth...

1198
01:59:12,410 --> 01:59:15,324
Truth? Why?

1199
01:59:15,418 --> 01:59:16,640
What's this book?

1200
01:59:17,050 --> 01:59:20,859
Give the book back to me

1201
01:59:20,954 --> 01:59:25,341
I can't swear, go away

1202
01:59:26,586 --> 01:59:30,689
- I swear...
- I swear

1203
01:59:33,787 --> 01:59:37,475
I swear

1204
01:59:41,274 --> 01:59:43,042
All these witnesses are Krishna's friends

1205
01:59:43,258 --> 01:59:47,459
From 1986 to 2005 they were together
in Kotagiri institute for mental health

1206
01:59:47,546 --> 01:59:52,130
Required evidence
for that is on page #13

1207
01:59:55,355 --> 01:59:59,523
What other evidence is needed
to confirm Krishna's mental instability?

1208
02:00:01,851 --> 02:00:07,045
Those who befriend mentally challenged people
need not themselves be mentally unstable!

1209
02:00:07,483 --> 02:00:13,922
Our learned counsel is unaware that evidence
by these witnesses is null and void

1210
02:00:14,908 --> 02:00:16,293
It surprises me

1211
02:00:21,372 --> 02:00:23,718
Will you accept evidence
by my witness who is of sound mind?

1212
02:00:23,867 --> 02:00:25,821
He is a friend of these
mentally challenged witnesses

1213
02:00:32,859 --> 02:00:35,587
I swear the whole truth
and nothing but the truth

1214
02:00:36,412 --> 02:00:37,917
Is Krishna your employer?

1215
02:00:38,012 --> 02:00:44,069
Krishna is a helper
Our manager is Victor

1216
02:00:44,988 --> 02:00:46,177
Describe Krishna

1217
02:00:46,588 --> 02:00:49,829
Krishna is like a child

1218
02:00:49,916 --> 02:00:53,222
- Which means?
- A little...

1219
02:00:53,821 --> 02:00:56,734
- Of unsound mind
- Yes

1220
02:01:00,668 --> 02:01:05,535
- Wow! Bashyam is amazing!
- Curtain fall for all

1221
02:01:05,756 --> 02:01:08,834
- Do you know Bhanumathi?
- Very well

1222
02:01:08,988 --> 02:01:14,270
Poor girl! She married this Krishna
Died prematurely in child birth

1223
02:01:14,941 --> 02:01:17,920
For God's sake don't give custody
of the child to Krishna

1224
02:01:18,013 --> 02:01:19,967
Nila's life will also be an unholy mess!

1225
02:01:22,173 --> 02:01:23,744
Mr Nlurthy, you can leave now

1226
02:01:26,077 --> 02:01:28,357
How can you so flippantly ask me to go?

1227
02:01:28,445 --> 02:01:32,450
Mr Bashyam has spent
so much to bring us here

1228
02:01:32,541 --> 02:01:35,203
How can I go without a word to him?

1229
02:01:35,806 --> 02:01:37,890
He taught me word by word what to say

1230
02:01:37,982 --> 02:01:39,651
I hope I did full justicel

1231
02:01:39,806 --> 02:01:41,989
Wow! Bashyam is like Pandora's box!

1232
02:01:42,078 --> 02:01:45,700
He made even normal people act abnormal!

1233
02:01:45,789 --> 02:01:48,190
I hope I didn't forget any im portant dialog!

1234
02:01:49,821 --> 02:01:51,207
I don't understand

1235
02:01:51,870 --> 02:01:53,507
Leave this place right now

1236
02:01:53,598 --> 02:01:56,392
He has given me permission to go

A http://movieshdnow.com D VD

1238
02:02:38,719 --> 02:02:43,368
Life is a battle field
with its struggle and suffering

1239
02:02:47,968 --> 02:02:52,518
An anthem let us unite to sing

1240
02:02:52,639 --> 02:02:54,658
Wearied feet may weep in misery

1241
02:02:54,847 --> 02:02:57,030
Unslept eyes may eclipse unwillingly

1242
02:02:57,119 --> 02:03:01,670
Though it is dark and dreary
let us fight

1243
02:03:01,760 --> 02:03:06,179
Just round the next bend
sun will radiate its light

1244
02:03:06,367 --> 02:03:09,226
Dream will come true definitely

1245
02:03:09,311 --> 02:03:11,178
Are you pushing the child?

1246
02:03:11,360 --> 02:03:12,997
Who are you?
Get out

1247
02:03:13,087 --> 02:03:15,204
Why are you standing here?
Get out

1248
02:03:15,424 --> 02:03:16,929
Where is the watchman?

1249
02:03:17,344 --> 02:03:20,006
What are you doing in this play ground?

1250
02:03:21,696 --> 02:03:22,601
Stop it!

1251
02:03:23,040 --> 02:03:27,841
Are you a genius?
Most of you will fail the IQ test

1252
02:03:28,032 --> 02:03:30,826
Shall I tell what's going on, in your homes?

1253
02:03:31,072 --> 02:03:33,537
Don't make me wash
your dirty linen in public!

1254
02:03:33,856 --> 02:03:38,651
A http://movieshdnow.com D VD

1255
02:04:26,498 --> 02:04:27,786
Don't we have a life of our own?

1256
02:04:27,873 --> 02:04:29,444
Is Nila going to stay with us?

1257
02:04:31,009 --> 02:04:32,002
Then...?

1258
02:04:33,442 --> 02:04:36,650
After we are married, you'll be with me
Why are you obsessed with Nila?

1259
02:04:36,802 --> 02:04:38,854
Won't she be with us?

1260
02:04:42,369 --> 02:04:48,262
Your dad will take care of her
Or else there are plenty of 'homes'

1261
02:04:49,346 --> 02:04:50,699
I'll take care of the expenses

1262
02:04:53,826 --> 02:04:58,181
My sister was more of a mother to me
than my own mom...for her child...

1263
02:04:59,939 --> 02:05:05,133
I'm not sure if you will be in my life
but there's no life for me without Nila

1264
02:05:07,298 --> 02:05:11,718
There is no path on earth
that we cannot follow

1265
02:05:11,907 --> 02:05:16,294
Rivers don't stop to flow
fearing cavities hollow

1266
02:05:16,482 --> 02:05:21,000
There is not a single day
when the sun does not smile in the sky

1267
02:05:21,091 --> 02:05:25,325
A heart can never sink
with the downpour from the eye!

1268
02:05:25,443 --> 02:05:29,862
House of God has a holy face
with idol inside

1269
02:05:30,051 --> 02:05:34,536
More sacred are golden hearts
where He will surely reside

1270
02:05:34,627 --> 02:05:39,112
You are the epitome of motherhood
of tender loving care

1271
02:05:39,235 --> 02:05:43,752
Truest heart, no one can compare

1272
02:05:43,875 --> 02:05:45,927
Wearied feet may weep in misery

1273
02:05:46,147 --> 02:05:48,297
Unslept eyes may eclipse unwillingly

1274
02:05:48,452 --> 02:05:52,904
Though it is dark and dreary
let us fight

1275
02:05:53,059 --> 02:05:57,511
Just round the next bend
sun will radiate its light

1276
02:05:57,668 --> 02:06:02,633
Dream will come true definitely

1277
02:06:18,213 --> 02:06:20,166
Krishna is of sound mind

1278
02:06:25,285 --> 02:06:27,533
But why is he not coming here?

1279
02:06:31,685 --> 02:06:34,217
It's not essential that petitioner
has to attend when it's a civil proceeding

1280
02:06:34,404 --> 02:06:41,574
He should be here when the defense
lawyer needs to cross examine him

1281
02:06:44,741 --> 02:06:48,462
At the same time you should know
what the child's preference is

1282
02:06:48,997 --> 02:06:50,088
Nila should also be here

1283
02:06:50,148 --> 02:06:53,706
- To bring a child to court is...
- Produce the child in court

1284
02:07:00,325 --> 02:07:01,417
We are all here

1285
02:07:07,045 --> 02:07:09,032
They might have had a narrow escape so far

1286
02:07:09,126 --> 02:07:15,978
Everyone backing him up must
answer my questions...not just Krishna!!

1287
02:07:24,134 --> 02:07:26,033
What we achieved so far is no big deal

1288
02:07:26,406 --> 02:07:28,173
Tomorrow is the D'day for us!

1289
02:07:29,062 --> 02:07:33,132
If they ever find out we lied
we'll be minus our lawyer robes!

1290
02:07:33,478 --> 02:07:36,490
Even we can't face
Mr Bashyam's cross examination

1291
02:07:36,614 --> 02:07:37,771
Imagine Krishna's plight

1292
02:07:37,895 --> 02:07:40,939
I don't think it's a good idea
to show Krishna in court tomorrow

1293
02:07:41,030 --> 02:07:41,902
I know

1294
02:08:30,055 --> 02:08:31,147
Daddy

1295
02:08:39,655 --> 02:08:43,377
Thunder...scared

A http://movieshdnow.com D VD

1297
02:10:05,418 --> 02:10:09,423
I see a colored curve in your eyes

1298
02:10:09,706 --> 02:10:13,612
...that flirts with my eye lids new

1299
02:10:13,866 --> 02:10:17,172
What report is it weather-wise?

1300
02:10:17,354 --> 02:10:20,944
Hand in hand a sun and rain view

1301
02:10:21,034 --> 02:10:23,435
Within you...l see

1302
02:10:23,658 --> 02:10:25,612
I perceive

1303
02:10:25,770 --> 02:10:29,327
my love...my mother in you!

1304
02:10:29,483 --> 02:10:31,916
I taste defeat, dear

1305
02:10:32,042 --> 02:10:33,996
I lose...in toto

1306
02:10:34,187 --> 02:10:37,493
Whatever will happen here?

1307
02:10:37,707 --> 02:10:46,229
I am in a trance...sheer novelty

1308
02:10:46,891 --> 02:10:50,928
To my soul... you zoomed in as a mirror

1309
02:10:51,114 --> 02:10:55,250
You introduced myself to me

1310
02:10:55,371 --> 02:10:59,987
To my dreams...my sole answer

1311
02:11:02,539 --> 02:11:06,445
In your eyes I see a rainbow

1312
02:11:06,763 --> 02:11:10,768
that touches my eye lids aglow

1313
02:11:10,987 --> 02:11:14,260
What is this new climate?

1314
02:11:14,411 --> 02:11:18,830
Sun as rain's soul mate!

1315

A http://movieshdnow.com D VD

1316
02:12:05,421 --> 02:12:09,360
You breezed into my life out of the blue

1317
02:12:09,581 --> 02:12:13,520
Head to toe you bloomed in me anew

1318
02:12:13,869 --> 02:12:17,623
Maybe tomorrow you may part from me

1319
02:12:17,805 --> 02:12:21,941
You'll be a part of my memory

1320
02:12:22,029 --> 02:12:29,045
Don't you see...street gets lonely
after the chariot passes by

1321
02:12:29,965 --> 02:12:37,942
You baited me with your charm
I fell hook line and sinker!

1322
02:12:38,349 --> 02:12:46,512
Finally now because of you
realize my femininity

1323
02:12:46,606 --> 02:12:55,542
I fasten..wave..flatten..linger

1324
02:12:55,821 --> 02:13:04,049
My heart doesn't listen to me any longer

1325
02:13:04,302 --> 02:13:08,787
It criss-crosses into your path, my dear

1326

A http://movieshdnow.com D VD

1327
02:13:39,279 --> 02:13:41,265
Don't worry...just a sprain

1328
02:13:41,391 --> 02:13:43,541
I've applied this ointment
She'll be fine tomorrow

1329
02:13:43,887 --> 02:13:44,978
Please go sleep

1330
02:13:47,759 --> 02:13:49,112
Don't get worked up

1331
02:13:49,295 --> 02:13:50,135
Go to bed

1332
02:13:53,839 --> 02:13:55,192
I want to see my daddy

1333
02:13:55,759 --> 02:13:57,232
But your dad is not well

1334
02:13:57,487 --> 02:13:59,255
Why are you lying to me?

1335
02:14:00,463 --> 02:14:01,969
My daddy is here

1336
02:14:02,159 --> 02:14:05,487
Aren't we here for you?
Don't you like me?

1337
02:14:05,647 --> 02:14:10,099
You are with your dad
Can't I be with mine?

1338
02:14:17,328 --> 02:14:18,582
You called for me?

1339
02:14:31,568 --> 02:14:35,190
I was wondering
how my framework got rattled

1340
02:14:35,953 --> 02:14:39,030
Now I know
fault lies in the basement!

1341
02:14:42,833 --> 02:14:45,779
Did I give you questions
to cross examine me?

1342
02:14:47,057 --> 02:14:50,963
I wanted to single out the white sheep
from the flock of black sheep

1343
02:14:56,241 --> 02:14:57,910
This is your phone statement

1344
02:15:01,745 --> 02:15:04,472
When I gave you the questions
it was 4:00 RM

1345
02:15:05,809 --> 02:15:10,578
You've called Priya promptly at 4:05 RM
and showed your sincerity!

1346
02:15:13,585 --> 02:15:14,545
What's the plan?

1347
02:15:15,857 --> 02:15:18,738
Krishna will not come to court tomorrow

1348
02:15:19,666 --> 02:15:21,401
Krishna has been kidnapped

1349
02:15:21,841 --> 02:15:22,714
By whom?

1350
02:15:23,698 --> 02:15:24,538
You, sir

1351
02:15:24,689 --> 02:15:27,068
That's what we intend telling in the court

1352
02:15:35,250 --> 02:15:38,109
So long you took a salary from me
but you were on their side

1353
02:15:38,802 --> 02:15:42,424
Today you will be on my side!

1354
02:15:56,178 --> 02:15:58,132
This is constable Ranga's house

1355
02:16:14,419 --> 02:16:18,522
Come out

1356
02:16:20,915 --> 02:16:22,715
Let's go see Nila

1357
02:16:49,779 --> 02:16:52,573
In my 20 years of experience
how many cases I've witnessed

1358
02:16:53,524 --> 02:16:55,510
This is the 1st time I have wanted
to see the petitioner face to face

1359
02:16:55,860 --> 02:16:56,919
I want Nila

1360
02:17:00,019 --> 02:17:01,143
I want to see her

1361
02:17:04,211 --> 02:17:08,412
Say this tomorrow in court
I'll show your true colors

1362
02:17:10,228 --> 02:17:13,785
I had closed all doors
I don't know how Krishna went out

1363
02:17:13,972 --> 02:17:14,998
Where could he have gone?

1364
02:17:15,124 --> 02:17:17,175
He must have gone to see Nila

1365
02:17:23,157 --> 02:17:26,430
Krishna knows only this place
If he isn't even here...?

1366
02:18:16,694 --> 02:18:19,705
How are you here?
What are you doing here?

1367
02:18:23,126 --> 02:18:24,250
I'm going

1368
02:18:24,950 --> 02:18:26,304
Stop...catch him

1369
02:18:26,582 --> 02:18:28,502
Watchman...stop him

1370
02:18:29,206 --> 02:18:30,460
Catch him

1371
02:18:45,014 --> 02:18:48,025
Did you pretend to bring him here?
Now you've helped him escape?

1372
02:18:48,695 --> 02:18:50,266
Don't make me lose face again!

1373
02:18:50,903 --> 02:18:52,802
I swear I am not part of this plan

1374
02:18:53,206 --> 02:18:54,592
He escaped of his own accord

1375
02:18:55,351 --> 02:18:57,304
He cannot think independently

1376
02:18:57,750 --> 02:18:58,590
You are the culprit

1377
02:18:59,255 --> 02:19:00,248
Please believe me

1378
02:19:00,374 --> 02:19:01,793
I am not part of this plan

1379
02:19:06,775 --> 02:19:08,641
If he isn't back in an hour here...

1380
02:19:24,727 --> 02:19:26,713
What happened, deal?

1381
02:19:31,384 --> 02:19:36,065
Where the hell is she?
Don't worry, kiddo

1382
02:19:42,040 --> 02:19:43,328
Stop for a minute

1383
02:19:49,208 --> 02:19:52,536
Where did you go?
Your phone is switched off

1384
02:19:55,160 --> 02:19:59,230
Krishna is missing!

1385
02:19:59,672 --> 02:20:02,586
My mom is sick
I have to go now

1386
02:20:07,161 --> 02:20:08,317
I must go

1387
02:20:08,536 --> 02:20:10,587
Okay, I'll take care
You leave

1388
02:20:17,113 --> 02:20:21,859
Janaki, his temperature is 103F
How could you be so careless?

1389
02:20:22,840 --> 02:20:24,445
It's not enough
to just give birth to a child

1390
02:20:24,953 --> 02:20:25,859
Charity begins at home!

1391
02:20:25,977 --> 02:20:27,450
Social service should take a back seat

1392
02:20:29,177 --> 02:20:30,301
What's happened?

1393
02:20:30,553 --> 02:20:32,026
Now you ask me

1394
02:20:33,049 --> 02:20:35,875
This is what will happen if you are a dad
when you should be a grand dad!

1395
02:20:43,577 --> 02:20:44,483
Where are you going?

1396
02:20:45,466 --> 02:20:47,103
He's back, sir

1397
02:20:48,409 --> 02:20:49,347
Get this medicine

1398
02:20:57,849 --> 02:20:59,769
- Where did you find him?
- He himself came back, sir

1399
02:21:01,658 --> 02:21:04,255
Paracetamol for fever
Tixylix for cough

1400
02:21:05,754 --> 02:21:07,903
This is what I just prescribed

1401
02:21:14,042 --> 02:21:15,908
Who is this newcomer?

1402
02:21:20,027 --> 02:21:21,980
Bashyam, you have an in-house doctor

1403
02:21:22,170 --> 02:21:24,571
Don't change doctors
just because I reprimanded you

1404
02:21:27,130 --> 02:21:31,550
Give this medicine after food
for the next 5 days, he'll be fine

1405
02:21:56,699 --> 02:21:58,598
Good people face maximum hurdles

1406
02:22:00,763 --> 02:22:03,840
But they come out winners

1407
02:22:43,580 --> 02:22:48,229
We are ready with all that you wanted
Anything else?

1408
02:22:52,252 --> 02:22:56,257
Your child...fever

1409
02:23:00,540 --> 02:23:06,433
Medicine...thrice a day...after food

1410
02:23:19,901 --> 02:23:21,571
Let's submit the petition after the hearing

1411
02:23:21,661 --> 02:23:22,915
He won't go anywhere

1412
02:23:27,325 --> 02:23:28,351
Tell her

1413
02:23:52,221 --> 02:23:53,313
Traitor

1414
02:24:06,719 --> 02:24:12,426
My Lord! I request your permission
to cross examine the petitioner Krishna

1415
02:24:22,015 --> 02:24:22,975
What is your name?

1416
02:24:26,590 --> 02:24:28,707
My name is Krishna

1417
02:24:30,143 --> 02:24:31,267
Are you unwell?

1418
02:24:35,422 --> 02:24:36,841
Any other problem?

1419
02:24:39,711 --> 02:24:40,966
Look at m e

1420
02:24:43,391 --> 02:24:47,559
Then why were you
in a mental institution from 1986 to 2005?

1421
02:24:51,775 --> 02:24:55,748
My mother told me she was not well

1422
02:24:56,095 --> 02:24:57,994
Your mother was unwell, or you?

1423
02:25:02,848 --> 02:25:03,786
Your father?

1424
02:25:04,127 --> 02:25:08,711
My father went away to be with God

1425
02:25:11,968 --> 02:25:13,703
There is no connection
between this case and these questions

1426
02:25:13,856 --> 02:25:15,078
There is a link, My Lord

1427
02:25:15,391 --> 02:25:18,600
The reasons for his stay in a mental institute

1428
02:25:18,688 --> 02:25:20,193
...are not his mother's ill health
or father's demise

1429
02:25:20,608 --> 02:25:23,718
When he was 3, they found out
he was mentally challenged

1430
02:25:23,808 --> 02:25:25,675
They admitted him in that institute

1431
02:25:27,424 --> 02:25:29,923
I've produced evidence already in court

1432
02:25:38,048 --> 02:25:38,986
Who is Nila?

1433
02:25:39,648 --> 02:25:41,481
My daughter

1434
02:25:41,568 --> 02:25:42,790
How old is she?

1435
02:25:44,993 --> 02:25:46,019
What is she doing?

1436
02:25:46,368 --> 02:25:47,558
She goes to school

1437
02:25:47,745 --> 02:25:48,585
Which school?

1438
02:26:02,273 --> 02:26:04,172
If you can't even pronounce
her school's name

1439
02:26:04,801 --> 02:26:06,023
...how will you take care of Nila?

1440
02:26:06,370 --> 02:26:07,624
I'll be a good dad

1441
02:26:07,745 --> 02:26:08,705
How can you take care?

1442
02:26:10,081 --> 02:26:13,922
Nila will soon be 10
then 15 years, she'll attain puberty

1443
02:26:15,873 --> 02:26:19,430
She'll be 10 years older than you mentally

1444
02:26:19,554 --> 02:26:23,427
What will you do then?

1445
02:26:24,513 --> 02:26:27,525
- I will...
- You will...

1446
02:26:30,114 --> 02:26:31,816
- Nila...
- Nila...?

1447
02:26:35,681 --> 02:26:38,660
- Krishna's mental age is 6
- I am a good dad

1448
02:26:39,906 --> 02:26:41,347
Nila is 5 now

1449
02:26:41,570 --> 02:26:47,146
When she is 6 years old, how can he,
sharing the same age take care of Nila?

1450
02:26:50,658 --> 02:26:55,427
Under the guise of questioning
learned counsel is threatening my client

1451
02:27:01,666 --> 02:27:03,653
I'll take care of Nila

1452
02:27:05,923 --> 02:27:07,625
I want Nila

1453
02:27:07,714 --> 02:27:09,155
Can you educate Nila the way she aspires?

1454
02:27:09,251 --> 02:27:11,596
Can you make her dreams come true?

1455
02:27:13,826 --> 02:27:14,764
You can't understand
Can you?

1456
02:27:15,171 --> 02:27:16,611
What will Nila be, if she is with you?

1457
02:27:18,947 --> 02:27:20,103
How will you make her a doctor?

1458
02:27:20,259 --> 02:27:22,659
You can't even remember her school's name

1459
02:27:22,818 --> 02:27:25,164
You needed help to get admission for her

1460
02:27:26,339 --> 02:27:29,034
What kind of future can you assure Nila?

1461
02:27:30,915 --> 02:27:31,875
I'll educate her

1462
02:27:32,003 --> 02:27:33,095
How will you make her a doctor?

1463
02:27:33,443 --> 02:27:34,632
Can you help her with her assignments?

1464
02:27:34,788 --> 02:27:38,148
Can you teach her Arithmetic?
Can you clear her doubts in Science?

1465
02:27:41,700 --> 02:27:43,599
- Do you know to teach her History?
- Tell him

1466
02:27:46,244 --> 02:27:50,511
When she's grown up can you
behave normally in society like her?

1467
02:27:50,596 --> 02:27:51,534
I want Nila

1468
02:27:51,748 --> 02:27:54,213
Do you want Nila to suffer
like how Bhanumathy did?

1469
02:27:55,172 --> 02:28:00,551
Forget making her a doctor
Can you make Nila a nurse?

1470
02:28:05,732 --> 02:28:08,711
I want Nila

1471
02:28:17,828 --> 02:28:21,353
If Nila is with you,
you can't take care of her

1472
02:28:22,437 --> 02:28:23,790
She has to take care of you!

1473
02:28:32,741 --> 02:28:35,785
Lily client Mr Rajendran
is the child's legal guardian

1474
02:28:36,036 --> 02:28:40,107
According to the guardian and wards act

1475
02:29:06,757 --> 02:29:10,860
Habeus corpus petition
was filed in this court

1476
02:29:11,174 --> 02:29:16,652
That is to bring Nila here
regarding her illegal custody

1477
02:29:17,862 --> 02:29:21,648
Nila is with her grand father
respondent Rajendran

1478
02:29:23,590 --> 02:29:24,910
Where did you go?

1479
02:29:26,342 --> 02:29:29,420
This habeus corpus was a ploy
to distract the court's attention...

1480
02:29:30,790 --> 02:29:35,057
...and try rejecting the move
to make Rajendran her legal guardian

1481
02:29:35,238 --> 02:29:37,322
For this sole reason this petition
should be dismissed

1482
02:29:37,478 --> 02:29:39,726
Instead of appealing to a higher authority
and wasting valuable time

1483
02:31:02,376 --> 02:31:07,788
So My Lord, Nila to grow up with Krishna

1484
02:31:22,984 --> 02:31:24,589
I have no objections

1485
02:32:32,810 --> 02:32:34,709
Neither you nor I am the winner

1486
02:32:36,139 --> 02:32:37,677
It is Krishna's unconditional love

1487
02:32:40,459 --> 02:32:44,594
For the 1st time I am glad I lost

1488
02:32:54,123 --> 02:32:59,023
- It doesn't matter
- I had no other go

1489
02:33:01,419 --> 02:33:03,951
Krishna is here

1490
02:33:04,940 --> 02:33:07,821
Nila is here

1491
02:34:20,589 --> 02:34:23,022
She loves her daddy tonnes and gallons

1492
02:34:28,206 --> 02:34:32,919
Tell her I am not well if she asks

1493
02:34:34,829 --> 02:34:35,986
She will ask

1494
02:34:37,038 --> 02:34:42,199
When she wakes up at 7:00 A.M
she drinks a huge glass of milk

1495
02:34:43,533 --> 02:34:45,203
7:30 A.M is her shower time

1496
02:34:46,094 --> 02:34:51,474
8:30 A.M is her breakfast time

1497
02:34:51,598 --> 02:34:54,676
She doesn't like food that's too spicy

1498
02:34:54,894 --> 02:34:57,720
3:00 RM she is back from school

1499
02:34:57,934 --> 02:35:00,400
4:00 RM is her playtime

1500
02:35:08,398 --> 02:35:10,198
What have you done?

1501
02:35:21,007 --> 02:35:25,459
If Nila is with you,
you can't take care of her

1502
02:35:26,574 --> 02:35:28,080
She has to take care of you!

1503
02:35:33,711 --> 02:35:38,130
Nila should have all the comforts

1504
02:35:41,935 --> 02:35:46,169
I can't...

1505
02:35:49,871 --> 02:35:53,396
They can...

1506
02:35:57,391 --> 02:36:03,960
Nila will one day be a famous doctor

1507
02:36:20,391 --> 02:36:22,960
Nila will shine
