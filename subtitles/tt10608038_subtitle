1
00:00:07,833 --> 00:00:11,541
Smoking and consumption of alcohol is  
injurious to health and it causes cancer.

2
00:01:45,708 --> 00:01:49,458
The meteorological department  
has announced..

3
00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:51,708
..that the two Telugu states 
will experience heavy rains..

4
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:55,250
..with gale, lightning and 
thunder in the next 24 hours..

5
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:58,583
..because of cyclonic 
effects in the Bay Of Bengal.

6
00:01:58,958 --> 00:02:02,333
The government has urged 
everyone living in lowlands..

7
00:02:02,416 --> 00:02:04,333
..to immediately evacuate 
and move to safer grounds.

8
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:08,041
The revenue department 
and the police force..

9
00:02:08,125 --> 00:02:10,875
..sprang into action to start 
off relief and support activities.

10
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:14,666
Three convicts escape 
from the Charlapalli Prison.

11
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,833
The three men named Vineet, 
Puneet and Advith..

12
00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:20,458
..who were recently convicted 
in the shocking case of..

13
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:23,500
..Meghana's rape and 
murder have managed to..

14
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:25,833
..escape from the Charlapalli Prison.

15
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:26,416
Vineet.

16
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:26,958
Puneet.

17
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:28,291
Advith.

18
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:30,208
Ranjan!

19
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:31,166
Bhaskar!

20
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:34,958
Sir!

21
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:37,000
Alert all the check-posts in the city.

22
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:38,750
Do a thorough check of all the vehicles.

23
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:40,125
Check all public places.

24
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:42,791
Shopping malls, 
theaters, bus stands, railway stations..

25
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:45,750
..airport, 
hospitals, including ambulances.

26
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,250
No exceptions. Am I clear?

27
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:48,125
Yes, sir!

28
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:49,166
Good. Disperse.

29
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:10,291
There is a press-meet 
at the ACP's office..

30
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:11,916
..in a few minutes.

31
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,416
All media personnel are eager to see..

32
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:20,000
..ACP Narsimha's response 
on the convicts' escape.

33
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:30,916
Good evening, everybody!

34
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Good evening, sir.

35
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:37,458
Sir! How could the 
convicts escape so easily?

36
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:39,708
How will people feel secure 
when hardcore criminals..

37
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:43,125
..are freely roaming about? 
What are the police doing?

38
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:47,500
Do we view it as your failure.. 
I mean, police failure?

39
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:50,625
Are you done? 
Or, are there any questions left?

40
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:54,833
Your department hasn't been 
able to nab the convicts yet.

41
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:55,916
Doesn't that prove how inept you are?

42
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:58,666
Who says that? Huh? Who says that?

43
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:00,333
If there's a sudden cyclone..

44
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:03,000
..does that mean that the meteorological 
department is incompetent?

45
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:06,291
Don't pose stupid questions 
just because you can.

46
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:07,208
Next.

47
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:09,625
It's already been two hours 
since the convicts escaped.

48
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,958
When will you catch them?

49
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:13,208
Those convicts are 
not some petty pickpockets.

50
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:15,750
They are notorious criminals 
who brutally raped..

51
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:17,250
..and murdered an innocent woman.

52
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,583
I arrested them and made 
sure they got a sentence.

53
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:24,250
You know that. 
I can assure you one thing.

54
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:28,250
My bullet will hit them 
before your mics can reach them.

55
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:44,833
(Police siren wails)

56
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:03,750
It's not safe here. 
Let's get out of here.

57
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:13,083
(Police siren wails)

58
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,041
(Clock ticking)

59
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,708
The person you are trying 
to call is currently unavailable.

60
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:31,333
Please try again..

61
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:40,083
(Thud)

62
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:50,250
(Door creaks)

63
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:53,541
(Thunder crashing)

64
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,458
(Window slamming)

65
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:13,000
(Thunder crashing)

66
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:25,500
(Electrical buzz)

67
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:39,625
(Gasps)

68
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:08,333
(Screams)

69
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:11,750
Stop!

70
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:20,875
Who are you?

71
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:23,291
Let me go!

72
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,916
Help!

73
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:35,416
Help me!

74
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:38,583
Let me go! Help!

75
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:40,291
(Electrical buzz) 
- Help! Help!

76
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:41,458
Help!

77
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:44,583
Shut up! Shut your mouth!

78
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:46,750
We are escaped criminals..

79
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:48,083
..who were put in prison 
for rape and murder.

80
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:50,750
Don't shout. 
The police are searching for us.

81
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:54,833
Give us one hour. 
We'll kill you if you make a sound.

82
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,541
My husband. He is not at home.

83
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:14,000
He'll be back any minute.

84
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,000
(Door bell rings)

85
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:16,958
(Police siren wails)

86
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:18,625
(Door bell rings)

87
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:23,875
(Door bell rings)

88
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,416
Wait. I don't care if it's 
the police or somebody else.

89
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:30,333
If you tell them that we are here..

90
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:31,666
(Door bell rings)

91
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:34,083
Go open it.

92
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,083
Let's go.

93
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:41,291
(Door bell rings)

94
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,291
Let's go upstairs.

95
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:51,125
(Door bell rings)

96
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:09,375
Cupboard. Let's hide in the cupboard.

97
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:11,416
(Screams)

98
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:14,583
Oh God! Dead body.

99
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:17,916
Get him off me!

100
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:21,000
Get him off me!

101
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:25,083
Come on, lift him up! Hurry up!

102
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:38,083
(Gasps)

103
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:07,500
Please. Please, help me.

104
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:17,291
(Door bell rings)

105
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:21,291
(Door bell rings)

106
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:27,750
Down here.

107
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:28,500
(Gasps)

108
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:31,875
It's me. Abbas Paul.

109
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:38,041
He's not at home.

110
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:39,583
That's why I'm here.

111
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:43,125
How can you barge inside like that?

112
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:46,708
Barge? What took you 
so long to answer the door?

113
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,750
I heard you scream and came running.

114
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:56,125
Since you are alone at home, 
I braved the rain to come.

115
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:58,541
So late at night? 
Why didn't you just call?

116
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:01,541
Good question. Give me a second.

117
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:05,125
He's your husband, isn't he? 
And I'm your neighbor.

118
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:06,833
A man just like him.

119
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,875
Mr. Paul. Maybe I screamed 
because I had a nightmare.

120
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:10,625
Please go.

121
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:14,666
But it didn't sound like that. 
You sounded scared.

122
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:19,000
An anxious mind in a body 
is like a dead body at home.

123
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:23,083
I've a headache. Please, go.

124
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:24,375
Oh no. You've a headache?

125
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:27,541
Let's go to the bedroom. 
I'll apply balm and..

126
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:30,208
..give you a massage. 
Your headache will be gone.

127
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,500
Where's the balm?

128
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,666
Mr. Paul! 
I'm talking to you! Stop right there!

129
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:36,666
What are you doing? Please leave. Leave.

130
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:38,500
Why do you look so worried?

131
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:40,625
I'm not worried. Please get up. Get up..

132
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:41,958
(Fly buzzing)

133
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:42,958
A fly.

134
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,208
A fly in a house is called a housefly.

135
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:49,625
An illicit affair and pickled 
mangoes taste delicious.

136
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:52,333
Why are you telling me all this? 
Please, leave.

137
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:54,916
Good question. Give me a second.

138
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:57,833
Did you watch the news on TV?

139
00:12:57,916 --> 00:13:02,333
Three men brutally raped 
and killed a girl named Meghana.

140
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:05,791
Those three men escaped from prison.

141
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,916
You're good at dodging too.

142
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:11,583
Those criminals..

143
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:17,250
I like the way you hurried towards me.

144
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:21,083
It seems they are 
called the Diaper Gang.

145
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:24,208
They target women who are alone, 
like you.

146
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:25,375
(Thud)

147
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:27,583
Oh no! What's that sound?

148
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,083
Maybe it's them. 
Come on, let's see who it is.

149
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:33,375
Come on, let's go. 
- No, I'll hide in this cupboard.

150
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:35,291
Come on, let's see who it is. Come on.

151
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:36,583
I'm scared.

152
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:40,125
Get out. 
- Don't push me, I'll fall down.

153
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:56,541
You said he's not at home.

154
00:13:58,750 --> 00:13:59,708
I lied.

155
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:04,250
I killed my husband.

156
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:06,000
(Thunder crashing)

157
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:10,291
You killed him?

158
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:12,000
Yes, I killed him.

159
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:14,250
(Thunder crashing)

160
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:24,583
Rahul.

161
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:27,250
One of the most famous 
ad-film makers in India.

162
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:29,125
Action!

163
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:36,625
(Camera clicks)

164
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,958
(Camera clicks)

165
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:43,541
(Camera clicks)

166
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:51,458
(Camera clicks)

167
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,375
(Camera clicks)

168
00:14:57,583 --> 00:15:00,083
(Camera clicks)

169
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:05,625
He's willing to take any 
kind of risk for his photography.

170
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:06,666
Just a moment.

171
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,708
Okay. 
- Yeah, perfect. Perfect.

172
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:09,625
Camera.

173
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,625
Don't move.

174
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:13,083
Jessie!

175
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:15,000
On the count of five.

176
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:17,083
Rahul, what's happening? 
What's all this?

177
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:23,750
Five, four, three, two..

178
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:25,708
No! 
- (Camera clicks)

179
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:28,083
I love your work.

180
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:29,250
Rahul. 
- Hmm?

181
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,416
I'm ready to marry you if you say yes.

182
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,583
Thank you, but I'm sorry.

183
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:39,791
If you get married to her, 
you will become..

184
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:41,916
..one of the richest 
persons in the country.

185
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:43,875
I don't want a girl who is mad about me.

186
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:46,041
I want someone who'll 
make me go mad for her.

187
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:54,958
(Goat bleats)

188
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,708
(Goat bleats)

189
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:02,666
(Brakes squeal)

190
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,916
Why did you ruin the shot? 
We are shooting.

191
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:15,333
Will you kill a poor lamb  
for your shooting?

192
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:18,375
How would you like to be in its place, 
you monkey face?

193
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:51,041
I'm an orphan who grew up in 
Pucchalapalli Sundaraiah Orphanage.

194
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:56,041
Mr. Sundaraiah founded the orphanage.

195
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:24,416
Mahalaxmi! 
- Yes?

196
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,000
Come here. 
- What's up?

197
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,416
Looks like your mother 
is cooking up a feast today.

198
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:29,833
I can smell the food from here.

199
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:34,500
Not my mother. 
Some uncle is cooking 'Biryani' for us.

200
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:36,375
'Biryani'? 
- Yes.

201
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:41,083
Yes, Vidya. 
Usually people donate money for food.

202
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:45,250
But this man wanted to cook 
'Biryani' with his own hands.

203
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,541
Excuse me. I'm Vidya. Nice to meet you.

204
00:17:58,666 --> 00:17:59,458
I love you.

205
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,541
I love you.

206
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:22,375
I love you.

207
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:29,625
Let's go.

208
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:32,541
I love you.

209
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:37,583
Please, stop it. Ever since I saw you..

210
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:40,375
..you've been following me around 
like a puppy saying 'I love you.'

211
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:41,083
Who are you?

212
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:58,750
Hello. This is Mr. 
Rahul. A famous ad-film maker.

213
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:01,708
All the CEOs of India's top companies..

214
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:03,333
..wait for his appointment.

215
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:06,791
Many models queue up 
for him in the hopes of..

216
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:10,416
..shooting an ad with 
him to become a top model.

217
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,708
A man like him is here for you..

218
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:14,458
Das, that's okay.

219
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:16,000
Santosh!

220
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:30,958
Vidya.. I'm not as great as Das claims..

221
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:34,875
..but I was haughty that no one can..

222
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:39,833
..make ads like me 
or shoot photos like me.

223
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:45,291
And for the first time.. 
You came into a frame I made..

224
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:47,541
..and increased its beauty 100 fold.

225
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:51,416
Its a million dollar shot. 
So I believe that..

226
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,625
..my life will be even 
better if you are with me.

227
00:19:55,833 --> 00:20:00,833
So.. I want to marry you.

228
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:07,916
What are you waiting for, Vidya? 
Go ahead.

229
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,500

230
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:32,458

00:22:25,416 --> 00:22:30,916

00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:47,750

heart and made me restless"

"Homage"

(Music)

249
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:38,333
"The first step that we took together.."

250
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:43,958
"..lead us to a shared life"

251
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:52,791
"The first step that we took together.."

252
00:23:52,875 --> 00:23:57,708

in each other's arms"

of sweat on your forehead"

"Homage"

259
00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:59,750
Oh!

260
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:03,125
(Moaning)

261
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:21,625

(Moaning)

263
00:25:34,916 --> 00:25:36,458
Water! There's water!

264
00:25:36,666 --> 00:25:38,416
Look at all this water!

265
00:25:38,583 --> 00:25:40,625
Where is it coming from?

266
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,500
Where is this water coming from?

267
00:25:54,333 --> 00:25:56,875
I don't know. I really don't know.

268
00:25:56,958 --> 00:26:00,166
Oh God! Maybe that 
dead Rahul is behind this.

269
00:26:00,375 --> 00:26:01,625
What? Shut up!

270
00:26:05,416 --> 00:26:06,500
What is going on?

271
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:10,000
Hey.. Look there!

272
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,125
Let's check it out.

273
00:26:14,666 --> 00:26:16,875
No, I won't come. You go on.

274
00:26:22,166 --> 00:26:24,625
Lord Shiva! Lord Anjaneya!

275
00:27:59,416 --> 00:28:00,208
Rahul!

276
00:28:00,875 --> 00:28:02,833
Vidya, come.

277
00:28:03,041 --> 00:28:05,625
I didn't want to wake you up. 
Come, join me.

278
00:28:09,125 --> 00:28:10,583
What are you doing?

279
00:28:12,041 --> 00:28:14,291
I'm watching our romance.

280
00:28:14,375 --> 00:28:16,625
How can you make a video 
of the intimate moments..

281
00:28:16,708 --> 00:28:18,416
..between us in the bedroom? 
Are you mad?

282
00:28:18,708 --> 00:28:23,416
Of course. I'm mad. I'm mad about you.

283
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:25,333
What's wrong in it, Vidya?

284
00:28:25,625 --> 00:28:29,041
Why do we have a video 
of our engagement and wedding?

285
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:32,791
Because they are all 
sweet memories, right?

286
00:28:34,083 --> 00:28:36,750
Our first night is the 
sweetest of all memories.

287
00:28:38,125 --> 00:28:39,458
What's wrong in having it on video?

288
00:28:39,541 --> 00:28:40,375
We show those videos to everyone.

289
00:28:40,458 --> 00:28:41,541
Will you show this 
video to everyone too?

290
00:28:41,625 --> 00:28:43,916
(Laughs)

291
00:28:44,333 --> 00:28:49,500
No, no, no. This is just for me, 
I mean, just for us.

292
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:50,875
Obviously.

293
00:28:52,708 --> 00:28:57,500
You look so beautiful 
in that wonderful moment.

294
00:28:58,666 --> 00:29:04,208
Especially, those lips. 
Those half opened lips.

295
00:29:05,208 --> 00:29:07,458
Your expression is so erotic.

296
00:29:08,083 --> 00:29:12,083
Your beauty increased 
100 fold in that moment.

297
00:29:12,791 --> 00:29:15,250
All the blood in your 
body rushed to your face.

298
00:29:16,125 --> 00:29:19,000
You look like an early morning sun. 
Just look.

299
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:22,000
Rahul, it's so disgusting. 
Please, stop it.

300
00:29:27,583 --> 00:29:29,458
Vidya, be honest.

301
00:29:30,958 --> 00:29:33,125
Did you ever see yourself 
looking so beautiful?

302
00:29:34,125 --> 00:29:36,500
That moment will be 
lost if you close your eyes.

303
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:40,750
But if you record it, 
you can watch it your whole life.

304
00:29:42,125 --> 00:29:45,291
And.. I'm watching 
you in a very artistic way.

305
00:29:45,375 --> 00:29:47,166
So, let's have fun.

306
00:29:47,625 --> 00:29:52,416
This is not fun. 
This is porn. You are objectifying me.

307
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:53,958
What's wrong with you?

308
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:56,083
Why are you making it a big issue?

309
00:29:56,333 --> 00:29:57,916
I'm not showing it to public.

310
00:29:58,541 --> 00:30:00,375
Don't spoil my mood. Let's go.

311
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,291
Stop that nonsense. 
Delete that video first.

312
00:30:05,083 --> 00:30:06,541
I can't see that rubbish.

313
00:30:07,708 --> 00:30:10,750
What? Rubbish?

314
00:30:12,833 --> 00:30:14,375
Don't you ever say that again!

315
00:30:15,958 --> 00:30:17,250
You are insulting my passion.

316
00:30:17,333 --> 00:30:19,541
Passion? What do you mean?

317
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:22,041
Why did you shoot a 
video without my permission?

318
00:30:22,833 --> 00:30:24,916
What permission? You are my property.

319
00:30:29,666 --> 00:30:30,625
Property?

320
00:30:30,708 --> 00:30:32,208
Yes, you are my property.

321
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:36,916
I mean.. I'm sorry, Vidya.

322
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,291
Don't. Don't touch me.

323
00:30:39,541 --> 00:30:41,458
Please hear me out. 
- Please.

324
00:30:42,583 --> 00:30:43,416
Vidya!

325
00:30:43,458 --> 00:30:44,375
(Door opens)

326
00:30:45,583 --> 00:30:46,416
(Door closes)

327
00:31:05,125 --> 00:31:05,833
(Sighs)

328
00:31:07,041 --> 00:31:08,125
Did I scare you?

329
00:31:09,166 --> 00:31:11,958
Knife and wife.

330
00:31:13,458 --> 00:31:14,250
Nice frame.

331
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,791
I'm sorry for what happened last night.

332
00:31:20,166 --> 00:31:24,958
I deleted that video. 
Already deleted it. I'm sorry.

333
00:31:26,083 --> 00:31:28,666
Stab me with this knife 
if you don't believe me. Stab me.

334
00:31:28,833 --> 00:31:29,916
Stab me! 
- Rahul!

335
00:31:30,416 --> 00:31:32,166
Should I stab myself? 
- Let it go!

336
00:31:35,166 --> 00:31:37,791
I'm sorry, Vidya. Please, forgive me.

337
00:31:38,125 --> 00:31:39,916
You are taking it too lightly.

338
00:31:40,916 --> 00:31:42,958
It's something that 
should be just between us.

339
00:31:43,208 --> 00:31:44,666
How could you record it?

340
00:31:45,375 --> 00:31:47,958
Even we don't look into 
each other's eyes in that moment.

341
00:31:48,625 --> 00:31:51,500
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

342
00:31:52,791 --> 00:31:55,916
The camera is my third eye.

343
00:31:56,083 --> 00:31:57,958
That's my strength and my weakness too.

344
00:32:01,208 --> 00:32:04,083
Unfortunately, 
I've never had any direct relationship..

345
00:32:04,166 --> 00:32:06,166
..with a thing or a person 
ever since I was a child.

346
00:32:06,875 --> 00:32:09,083
All I know is the world 
I create with my camera.

347
00:32:11,333 --> 00:32:13,000
Instead of experiencing 
life with my senses..

348
00:32:13,083 --> 00:32:14,416
..I started looking 
at things through my lens.

349
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,750
Probably, that's a disorder.

350
00:32:20,916 --> 00:32:24,125
I'm very fortunate that you married me.

351
00:32:24,625 --> 00:32:28,083
I'll see a doctor if you want. 
I'm ready to come.

352
00:32:30,041 --> 00:32:34,666
Please, don't be upset. 
I'm sorry. I'll touch your feet.

353
00:32:36,666 --> 00:32:37,916
I hope you won't do it again.

354
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,041
I swear. I swear on you.

355
00:32:40,916 --> 00:32:41,666
Hmm.

356
00:32:42,791 --> 00:32:43,625
Okay?

357
00:32:44,916 --> 00:32:45,750
What are you doing?

358
00:32:46,333 --> 00:32:47,750
I'm cooking lunch.

359
00:32:49,666 --> 00:32:52,375
No lunch. 
I'll take you to a restaurant today.

360
00:32:52,458 --> 00:32:53,708
We'll have it there. Okay?

361
00:33:16,541 --> 00:33:17,208
(Camera clicks)

362
00:33:36,583 --> 00:33:37,791
Hi, Rahul. 
- Hi.

363
00:33:38,041 --> 00:33:39,375
Hi, uncle. 
- Hello.

364
00:33:43,791 --> 00:33:44,625
How's the ambience?

365
00:33:44,666 --> 00:33:45,291
I like it.

366
00:33:45,375 --> 00:33:46,541
Sir! Order, please.

367
00:33:47,208 --> 00:33:47,791
Yeah.

368
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:52,083
One Non-Veg Platter and 
one 'Maharaja Pulao'. Very fast.

369
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:53,375
And yours, ma'am?

370
00:33:53,458 --> 00:33:53,875
Yeah.

371
00:33:53,958 --> 00:33:56,833
I already ordered. 
You want to order again?

372
00:33:57,291 --> 00:33:58,625
No. That's fine. 
- Yeah. Take it.

373
00:34:12,708 --> 00:34:13,666
Ganesh?

374
00:34:13,833 --> 00:34:15,916
Vidya! Surprise! 
- What a surprise!

375
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
(Laughs)

376
00:34:17,083 --> 00:34:19,375
So good to see you. So good to see you.

377
00:34:19,666 --> 00:34:20,333
Hey!

378
00:34:26,041 --> 00:34:28,375
High five! 
- Hello! Don't forget me.

379
00:34:28,458 --> 00:34:29,125
Chaitu?

380
00:34:29,291 --> 00:34:30,333
What are you both doing here?

381
00:34:30,416 --> 00:34:32,041
He finished his IAS 
training and returned..

382
00:34:32,125 --> 00:34:33,416
..from Missouri yesterday.

383
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,500
We were trying to figure 
out how to find your house and..

384
00:34:35,583 --> 00:34:37,166
..luckily we saw you here.

385
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:38,250
Best friends in college.

386
00:34:38,875 --> 00:34:41,000
But she didn't invite 
me for the wedding.

387
00:34:41,083 --> 00:34:43,000
That's wrong. 
- Your final exams were on.

388
00:34:43,083 --> 00:34:45,583
So what? 
I could've tried again next year.

389
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:47,000
That's exactly why I didn't invite you.

390
00:34:47,291 --> 00:34:48,875
Then marry a second time, Vidya

391
00:34:51,125 --> 00:34:52,083
I forgot.

392
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:54,750
Rahul, Ganesh.

393
00:34:55,333 --> 00:34:56,833
Ganesh, Rahul my husband.

394
00:34:56,916 --> 00:34:58,750
Hey! It's such a pleasure meeting you.

395
00:34:59,541 --> 00:35:01,208
You won't believe it, bro.

396
00:35:01,708 --> 00:35:04,666
Everyone in college thought 
that whoever Vidya marries..

397
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:05,958
..will become a big celebrity.

398
00:35:06,166 --> 00:35:10,625
But a big celebrity married our Vidya. 
It's simply great.

399
00:35:11,833 --> 00:35:14,416
As Vidya's life partner, 
you are special to us too.

400
00:35:14,625 --> 00:35:15,625
You are very lucky.

401
00:35:16,875 --> 00:35:21,791
Your words clearly show 
your admiration towards Vidya.

402
00:35:21,875 --> 00:35:25,708
It's not admiration, bro. It's devotion.

403
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:31,041
Vidya is a symbol of beauty. 
A symbol of humility.

404
00:35:31,125 --> 00:35:36,375
Vidya is a wonder. Vidya is everything.

405
00:35:36,541 --> 00:35:41,208
If this guy starts talking about Vidya, 
you don't need to order food.

406
00:35:41,291 --> 00:35:42,416
His words will fill your stomach.

407
00:35:42,583 --> 00:35:45,500
Oh. Vidya, shall we cancel our order?

408
00:35:45,583 --> 00:35:46,416
(Laughs)

409
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,833
Joke. Nice joke.

410
00:35:47,916 --> 00:35:49,666
No, no, no. Don't stop. 
- Chaitu, please.

411
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:51,500
Only our friends can 
tell us what we are like.

412
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:56,166
And only a girl's boyfriends 
can tell us what she's like.

413
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:57,583
(Laughs) 
- Continue.

414
00:35:58,166 --> 00:35:59,958
You are really funny, bro. 
- I know.

415
00:36:00,041 --> 00:36:04,541
But jokes apart, 
we find many friends in life.

416
00:36:05,375 --> 00:36:08,125
In short, 
if I have to talk about my life..

417
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:10,833
..it was before Vidya and after Vidya.

418
00:36:11,125 --> 00:36:14,375
Friends like Vidya help 
us to learn about ourselves.

419
00:36:14,583 --> 00:36:17,541
Oh, really? Then..

420
00:36:17,625 --> 00:36:19,708
Why am I meeting idiots 
like you because of Vidya?

421
00:36:23,333 --> 00:36:25,333
Why am I not learning much about myself?

422
00:36:25,541 --> 00:36:26,708
What are you talking about?

423
00:36:26,791 --> 00:36:27,416
Just shut up!

424
00:36:30,916 --> 00:36:33,166
He doesn't even the have 
the sense to understand..

425
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:34,833
..that he shouldn't intrude 
in a couple's private time.

426
00:36:34,916 --> 00:36:36,166
And he's going to be an IAS officer?

427
00:36:37,333 --> 00:36:38,416
I'm sorry, bro. 
- Just shut up.

428
00:36:38,625 --> 00:36:40,541
What were you doing before? 
Just do it again?

429
00:36:40,625 --> 00:36:44,083
No, just do it again. 
This, this, this and this. What's that?

430
00:36:44,166 --> 00:36:45,208
And then this fellow 
says not to forget him.

431
00:36:45,291 --> 00:36:46,916
Rahul! 
- Do I look like a fool? Just shut up!

432
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:47,750
Vidya, please.

433
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:52,083
It's my fault. 
Please don't fight because of me.

434
00:36:52,666 --> 00:36:53,375
You take care.

435
00:36:54,833 --> 00:37:00,166
I'm sorry for the disturbance, bro. 
I mean.. Sorry, sir.

436
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:02,583
Let's go. 
- Ganesh..

437
00:37:07,708 --> 00:37:09,166
Rahul, what is this?

438
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:11,125
Just sit. Just sit down.

439
00:37:14,625 --> 00:37:16,375
What you did is not right.

440
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:18,166
And you did the right 
thing before your husband?

441
00:37:19,375 --> 00:37:21,375
And what were those hand actions?

442
00:37:22,375 --> 00:37:23,541
Do I look like a used goods husband?

443
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:27,000
Rahul, please. 
Don't assume things about us.

444
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:31,416
Oh, really? 
Is he your friend or boyfriend?

445
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:33,000
He's more than that.

446
00:37:34,041 --> 00:37:36,541
(Applause)

447
00:38:16,625 --> 00:38:18,208
I love you so much that..

448
00:38:19,541 --> 00:38:21,375
I love you so much that..

449
00:38:21,958 --> 00:38:23,291
Did he forget his dialogues?

450
00:38:23,916 --> 00:38:25,083
I don't know how to say it..

451
00:38:25,166 --> 00:38:26,125
What's wrong?

452
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:31,291
I don't know how to say it..

453
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:33,541
There's no other option. 
Say it with words.

454
00:38:34,375 --> 00:38:35,291
What's going on?

455
00:38:35,375 --> 00:38:36,666
I don't know how to say it..

456
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:37,833
You can't say it.

457
00:38:40,958 --> 00:38:45,541
Yes. If you had to write 
down a poem about me..

458
00:38:46,166 --> 00:38:47,916
..you won't find words for it.

459
00:38:50,875 --> 00:38:52,541
If you had to give me a gift..

460
00:38:53,208 --> 00:38:56,125
..you won't find anything 
that is more precious than me.

461
00:38:59,458 --> 00:39:03,458
Your eyes tell me how much you love me.

462
00:39:07,666 --> 00:39:10,291
True love doesn't look for passion.

463
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:12,625
It looks for compassion.

464
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,250
Sincere love doesn't desire compliments.

465
00:39:19,083 --> 00:39:20,750
It desires a complete man.

466
00:39:25,166 --> 00:39:28,416
I can feel your love. I love you.

467
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:32,375
Yay! (Applause)

468
00:39:35,916 --> 00:39:38,583
Your spontaneous dialogues 
saved the day, darling.

469
00:39:58,833 --> 00:39:59,625
Hey. 
- Hmm?

470
00:39:59,708 --> 00:40:00,875
Your Romeo is here.

471
00:40:04,333 --> 00:40:04,958
Shut up.

472
00:40:17,208 --> 00:40:18,000
What's up, Ganesh?

473
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:23,583
I need to tell you something.

474
00:40:25,666 --> 00:40:28,291
I know what you are going to say.

475
00:40:31,041 --> 00:40:32,916
You think that whatever 
I said on the stage is true..

476
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,625
..and so you came 
to propose to me, right?

477
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:35,916
No, Vidya.

478
00:40:38,208 --> 00:40:39,875
When I was a little toddler..

479
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:44,083
..whenever I was about to fall, 
my mother used to..

480
00:40:44,166 --> 00:40:46,958
..hold both my hands so that I can walk.

481
00:40:48,541 --> 00:40:51,375
After I took a few steps, 
she used to squeal with joy..

482
00:40:51,625 --> 00:40:55,875
..take me into her arms 
and kiss me on my forehead.

483
00:40:57,041 --> 00:41:00,541
When I fumbled with 
my lines on the stage..

484
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:05,791
..you said those lines 
for me and kissed my forehead.

485
00:41:07,458 --> 00:41:11,041
The audience saw you as my lover.

486
00:41:12,833 --> 00:41:17,166
But I saw my mother 
in you in that moment.

487
00:41:23,125 --> 00:41:25,125
You misunderstood 
the bond between us and..

488
00:41:25,208 --> 00:41:27,166
..hurt my feelings with your behavior.

489
00:41:27,333 --> 00:41:28,500
This is not correct, Rahul.

490
00:41:28,708 --> 00:41:31,375
I don't care about your 
feelings or emotions, okay?

491
00:41:31,791 --> 00:41:35,000
And I didn't bring his mother with me, 
I brought my wife.

492
00:41:35,541 --> 00:41:36,958
You are my property.

493
00:41:37,375 --> 00:41:40,875
My property should bring me comfort, 
not to another man.

494
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:44,416
Eat.

495
00:41:47,083 --> 00:41:48,500
I'm not hungry anymore.

496
00:41:50,083 --> 00:41:52,000
(Anklets tinkling)

497
00:41:54,833 --> 00:41:55,750
Hello, ma'am.

498
00:41:55,958 --> 00:41:58,291
Hello. Is she your daughter?

499
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,250
Yes, ma'am.

500
00:41:59,708 --> 00:42:00,666
What is your name, darling?

501
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:01,875
Vaishnavi.

502
00:42:02,041 --> 00:42:04,125
Nice name. 
Did you offer up your hair in Tirupati?

503
00:42:05,416 --> 00:42:08,500
No, ma'am. She has cancer.

504
00:42:13,625 --> 00:42:16,708
They shaved her head 
for the chemotherapy.

505
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,375
Doctors said that she 
needs immediate surgery.

506
00:42:20,833 --> 00:42:25,583
He loves kids. 
He'll definitely help you. Talk to him.

507
00:42:27,208 --> 00:42:29,125
Do you want Complan or Horlicks?

508
00:42:29,375 --> 00:42:30,125
Boost!

509
00:42:32,916 --> 00:42:38,000
Boost is the secret of my energy. 
I want Boost.

510
00:42:40,166 --> 00:42:42,708
Go, Mom. You are Mom 
to everyone in this world.

511
00:42:44,208 --> 00:42:45,041
Good morning, sir.

512
00:42:45,333 --> 00:42:49,833
Das! If my wife is a Mom to you, 
I'm your Dad, right?

513
00:42:50,875 --> 00:42:52,541
Sorry, sir. Ma'am.

514
00:42:54,375 --> 00:42:55,291
Come. 
- Sir.

515
00:42:58,166 --> 00:42:59,083
What is today's schedule?

516
00:42:59,166 --> 00:43:01,541
We've to select models 
for the next ad shoot.

517
00:43:01,958 --> 00:43:04,333
I asked the coordinator 
to send in the photos.

518
00:43:04,416 --> 00:43:05,625
You've to select them.

519
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:06,583
Let me see.

520
00:43:06,958 --> 00:43:07,625
Sir.

521
00:43:16,083 --> 00:43:16,750
Oye.

522
00:43:17,166 --> 00:43:17,750
Beauty!

523
00:43:19,916 --> 00:43:20,750
Come here.

524
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:32,041
Vidya is a symbol of beauty. 
A symbol of humility, so on.

525
00:43:32,125 --> 00:43:34,291
That's what your son who 
is like a boyfriend said, right?

526
00:43:34,458 --> 00:43:36,666
I mean your boyfriend who is like a son.

527
00:43:39,875 --> 00:43:42,666
Select the girl you 
like from these photos.

528
00:43:55,791 --> 00:43:59,791
Good. Almost matches my taste.

529
00:44:00,791 --> 00:44:02,583
Okay, go. Give her Boost.

530
00:44:04,583 --> 00:44:05,833
Das. 
- Sir.

531
00:44:06,166 --> 00:44:07,833
Prepare a contract with 
her name and write a cheque.

532
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:08,625
Okay, sir.

533
00:44:15,333 --> 00:44:15,958
Sir..

534
00:44:16,208 --> 00:44:16,750
Yes?

535
00:44:17,958 --> 00:44:19,708
My little girl is getting 
treated for cancer.

536
00:44:20,958 --> 00:44:22,458
I'll need 2.5 million rupees.

537
00:44:22,916 --> 00:44:24,833
I've a house in my hometown. 
I've put it out for sale.

538
00:44:24,916 --> 00:44:28,125
I'll return the money 
as soon as it is sold.

539
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:30,125
Das. 
- Sir.

540
00:44:30,208 --> 00:44:33,166
When you came in with your daughter..

541
00:44:34,375 --> 00:44:36,166
..I looked at her hairstyle 
and expected that..

542
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:37,666
..you will play this emotional 
scene in front of me.

543
00:44:37,875 --> 00:44:39,291
Not now. First get the work done.

544
00:44:44,416 --> 00:44:46,958
Sir, you said the same 
thing when I asked you last time.

545
00:44:47,791 --> 00:44:49,666
I really need the money, sir.

546
00:44:51,458 --> 00:44:52,708
Even though I didn't like your work..

547
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:54,000
..I hired you because 
I liked your name Das.

548
00:44:54,416 --> 00:44:56,000
I thought you'll serve me like a slave.

549
00:44:57,791 --> 00:44:59,000
What is your salary?

550
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,291
25,000 rupees, sir. 
- What?

551
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:02,500
25,000 rupees, sir.

552
00:45:02,583 --> 00:45:05,500
Why does a man who 
earns 25,000 per month..

553
00:45:05,583 --> 00:45:07,208
..need treatment that 
costs 2.5 million rupees?

554
00:45:09,208 --> 00:45:13,708
Okay. Even if you spend 
2.5 million on her treatment..

555
00:45:13,791 --> 00:45:14,375
Sir..

556
00:45:14,833 --> 00:45:17,333
..there's no guarantee 
that she will survive. Right?

557
00:45:20,666 --> 00:45:26,166
Das! Even rich men like 
me have to finally trust in God.

558
00:45:27,416 --> 00:45:33,333
Do that. Because your 
little girl might die tomorrow.

559
00:45:38,625 --> 00:45:40,958
So better do your work.

560
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:48,666
Sir.

561
00:45:54,958 --> 00:45:57,416
So you came here with a backup plan.

562
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:58,166
Sir?

563
00:45:58,250 --> 00:46:00,333
What's your commission in this? 
5 million or 7.5 million?

564
00:46:02,291 --> 00:46:03,500
But how will I get 
5 million in commission..

565
00:46:03,583 --> 00:46:04,416
..for a cheque of one million?

566
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:08,916
Oh. Sorry, Dad. 
Does this look like one million to you?

567
00:46:11,291 --> 00:46:13,500
Sorry, sir. It's 10 million.

568
00:46:14,041 --> 00:46:16,041
But I wrote one million in words.

569
00:46:16,541 --> 00:46:18,250
I was under stress.. Let me correct it.

570
00:46:18,333 --> 00:46:19,458
No. 
- Please, sir.

571
00:46:19,541 --> 00:46:20,250
No.

572
00:46:20,708 --> 00:46:21,625
What is your daughter's name?

573
00:46:22,708 --> 00:46:23,958
Vaishnavi. 
- Vaishnavi.

574
00:46:24,208 --> 00:46:25,458
Vaishnavi, come here.

575
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,708
Vaishnavi, do you know how 
many zeroes are there in one million?

576
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:41,000
One, two, three, four, five, six. 
Six, uncle.

577
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:44,041
Very good. So, if you add 
an extra zero to one million..

578
00:46:45,291 --> 00:46:46,833
..will your teacher punish you or not?

579
00:46:46,916 --> 00:46:48,125
She'll punish me.

580
00:46:48,458 --> 00:46:52,125
Your Daddy added an extra zero. 
Should I hit him or not?

581
00:46:58,375 --> 00:47:00,625
Should I hit him or not?

582
00:47:01,083 --> 00:47:04,583
Not in front of my daughter, sir. 
Please, sir.

583
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:07,083
Ma'am, please tell him.

584
00:47:07,166 --> 00:47:08,333
Should I hit him or not?

585
00:47:08,708 --> 00:47:09,250
No..

586
00:47:09,333 --> 00:47:11,250
Rahul! 
- Daddy! (Crying)

587
00:47:14,125 --> 00:47:16,000
Das, please take her home.

588
00:47:16,833 --> 00:47:18,500
Daddy! (Crying)

589
00:47:19,083 --> 00:47:19,958
Go.

590
00:47:21,791 --> 00:47:23,666
What do you think you are doing?

591
00:47:24,291 --> 00:47:26,833
What do you mean, Mom?

592
00:47:26,916 --> 00:47:28,875
You donated 10 million 
to the orphanage that day.

593
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:31,166
He's been working for 
you for so many years.

594
00:47:31,541 --> 00:47:34,666
Can't you help him 
save his daughter's life?

595
00:47:36,166 --> 00:47:38,916
Yes, I donated 10 million 
to the orphans that day.

596
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,500
Not because I love them, 
it was because I love you.

597
00:47:48,208 --> 00:47:55,750
"Love is wonderful, 
but my lover is cruel"

598
00:47:57,291 --> 00:48:02,000
"Love has brought me.."

599
00:48:06,041 --> 00:48:07,375
What the heck is this?

600
00:48:07,583 --> 00:48:10,375
There are many top agencies 
that have brand image.

601
00:48:10,666 --> 00:48:12,958
But do you know why I 
signed this contract with you?

602
00:48:14,916 --> 00:48:17,208
Because all the top 
models follow you around.

603
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:21,583
You showed me a 
top-class model the day..

604
00:48:21,666 --> 00:48:23,125
..we signed the contract..

605
00:48:23,208 --> 00:48:24,875
..and now you show up 
with these third-class models?

606
00:48:25,833 --> 00:48:29,708
Did you lose your passion 
after getting married?

607
00:48:31,708 --> 00:48:32,625
Hold your tongue.

608
00:48:32,666 --> 00:48:34,458
Okay. I can.

609
00:48:35,458 --> 00:48:38,083
The deal was to shoot 
the ad with the best model.

610
00:48:38,375 --> 00:48:41,208
Now you came with someone else. 
Do I look like a fool?

611
00:48:42,458 --> 00:48:44,125
Do I look like a fool or what?

612
00:48:44,916 --> 00:48:49,833
(Phone rings)

613
00:48:52,333 --> 00:48:53,416
Look, Rahul.

614
00:48:53,875 --> 00:48:56,541
We pay you as much as 
you demand only because..

615
00:48:56,625 --> 00:48:59,000
..I know you'll increase 
the brand value of my company.

616
00:48:59,083 --> 00:49:01,375
(Phone rings)

617
00:49:03,708 --> 00:49:05,125
I'll give you one week's time.

618
00:49:05,625 --> 00:49:08,250
I want my ad to be 
done with the best model.

619
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:10,916
Otherwise I'll claim damages from you..

620
00:49:11,416 --> 00:49:13,083
..for delaying the contract.

621
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:28,958
(Door bell rings)

622
00:49:35,791 --> 00:49:37,250
(Door bell rings)

623
00:49:38,833 --> 00:49:40,291
(Banging on door)

624
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:13,791
(Sniffs)

625
00:50:18,666 --> 00:50:22,500
You look gorgeous. 
What's special about today?

626
00:50:24,791 --> 00:50:26,708
I've some good news for you.

627
00:50:27,208 --> 00:50:28,125
What?

628
00:50:32,291 --> 00:50:34,458
What is it? 
- You are going to be a father.

629
00:50:35,041 --> 00:50:36,125
What? 
- Yeah.

630
00:50:36,208 --> 00:50:40,375
Really? Wow! Whoa! What news! 
- (Laughs)

631
00:50:42,041 --> 00:50:43,083
Did you consult a doctor?

632
00:50:43,166 --> 00:50:46,583
No. I wanted to share 
this news with your first.

633
00:50:46,666 --> 00:50:49,208
What? Let's go to him right now. 
Come on.

634
00:50:51,791 --> 00:50:53,541
I never knew my mother.

635
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:57,208
But I'm very happy that 
I'm going to be a mother.

636
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,500
I can understand, Vidya.

637
00:51:15,625 --> 00:51:16,750
Is everything okay?

638
00:51:17,083 --> 00:51:21,416
Sorry, Vidya. 
Yours is not a normal pregnancy.

639
00:51:22,291 --> 00:51:23,208
It's a tubal pregnancy.

640
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:27,416
Usually a fetus forms in the uterus.

641
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:33,500
But in some rare cases, 
it forms in the fallopian tube.

642
00:51:33,958 --> 00:51:35,833
And that's what happened in your case.

643
00:51:35,916 --> 00:51:39,041
Once it starts growing in the tube, 
your life will be at risk.

644
00:51:39,125 --> 00:51:40,375
Better to remove it immediately.

645
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:47,166
This condition will put you  
and your baby at great risk.

646
00:51:48,208 --> 00:51:51,250
I say this as a doctor 
and your family friend.

647
00:51:52,041 --> 00:51:55,333
It's better to abort 
it as soon as possible.

648
00:51:56,625 --> 00:52:00,333
(Crying)

649
00:52:01,833 --> 00:52:04,916
Vidya.. Vidya, calm down.

650
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:09,708
Doctor, my Vidya is important to me.

651
00:52:11,291 --> 00:52:16,041
She must be safe. Please do the needful.

652
00:52:24,875 --> 00:52:27,541
Take rest, Vidya. Don't think too much.

653
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,125
I've some work at the office.

654
00:52:33,458 --> 00:52:35,250
I'll finish it and 
come back to you. Okay?

655
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:38,083
Come soon, Rahul.

656
00:52:38,166 --> 00:52:39,125
I will.

657
00:52:41,375 --> 00:52:42,125
Take rest.

658
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:55,666
Wow. Beautiful, man. 
Gorgeously beautiful.

659
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:58,625
This is the kind of beauty we need.

660
00:52:58,708 --> 00:53:00,625
I knew your capability, Rahul.

661
00:53:01,416 --> 00:53:03,166
If this beauty endorses my company..

662
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:05,250
..my company will grow to new heights. 
(Snaps finger)

663
00:53:08,375 --> 00:53:09,791
She's awesome, man.

664
00:53:17,458 --> 00:53:19,583
Why did you waste my 
time by showing other models..

665
00:53:19,666 --> 00:53:21,916
..when you have such 
a beautiful model with you?

666
00:53:23,291 --> 00:53:27,041
Nice. Superb.

667
00:53:27,458 --> 00:53:29,250
If you get this girl 
to endorse my brand..

668
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:31,791
..I'll give you double 
the amount that we agreed upon.

669
00:53:35,291 --> 00:53:36,166
(Sighs)

670
00:53:37,833 --> 00:53:39,791
Why didn't your children visit you yet?

671
00:53:39,875 --> 00:53:41,416
Did you leave them 
at your mother's place?

672
00:53:41,916 --> 00:53:44,250
I don't have a mother 
to look after my kids.

673
00:53:45,208 --> 00:53:48,458
And I don't have kids to call me Mom.

674
00:53:48,791 --> 00:53:52,500
Really? So why did you 
decide not to have children?

675
00:53:52,791 --> 00:53:57,583
Oh, no. I love children. 
We'll plan again in the future.

676
00:53:57,916 --> 00:53:59,125
Plan again?

677
00:53:59,333 --> 00:54:01,333
How can you have children 
after the uterus is removed?

678
00:54:03,166 --> 00:54:06,458
What are you talking about? 
I just had an abortion, right?

679
00:54:06,541 --> 00:54:09,000
Didn't you know about it? 
But your husband..

680
00:54:09,041 --> 00:54:10,500
..signed the declaration form..

681
00:54:10,583 --> 00:54:13,125
..and asked us do surgery 
to remove your uterus.

682
00:54:17,750 --> 00:54:19,333
You removed my uterus?

683
00:54:28,125 --> 00:54:30,000
(Thunder crashing)

684
00:54:33,375 --> 00:54:35,041
That rascal deserves to be killed.

685
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:39,625
What happened after that?

686
00:54:45,166 --> 00:54:46,291
Are you even a human?

687
00:54:46,375 --> 00:54:49,625
Rascal! Who gave you 
the right to make me barren?

688
00:54:51,333 --> 00:54:52,375
Oh, you know.

689
00:54:52,708 --> 00:54:55,708
I didn't know my parents.. 
I grew up as an orphan.

690
00:54:56,125 --> 00:54:59,875
I wanted my children to call me mother.

691
00:55:00,291 --> 00:55:02,041
But you took that away from me.

692
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:05,750
Vidya, calm down. 
What will you get by being a mother?

693
00:55:06,041 --> 00:55:07,833
You will just have ugly stretch 
marks on your pretty tummy.

694
00:55:08,041 --> 00:55:12,416
Your hourglass figure will 
turn into a deflated balloon.

695
00:55:14,083 --> 00:55:16,583
The best painters in the world 
will want to paint your beauty.

696
00:55:17,041 --> 00:55:19,375
When I first captured 
your beauty in the frame..

697
00:55:19,916 --> 00:55:23,333
..I wanted it to mine as long as I live. 
Is that wrong?

698
00:55:23,666 --> 00:55:26,291
The true beauty of 
a woman is in motherhood.

699
00:55:26,708 --> 00:55:28,625
It was my dream to 
give birth to children.

700
00:55:28,833 --> 00:55:31,083
I'm trying to turn 
you into a dream-girl..

701
00:55:31,791 --> 00:55:34,125
..and you want give birth to children? 
Silly woman.

702
00:55:34,625 --> 00:55:37,500
Shut up! I'll press charges 
on you and drag you to court.

703
00:55:37,833 --> 00:55:39,791
I'll make sure that you 
spend your life in prison.

704
00:55:39,875 --> 00:55:41,250
I don't care if you put me in prison..

705
00:55:41,333 --> 00:55:43,208
..go to women's associations, 
drag me to court..

706
00:55:43,291 --> 00:55:45,416
..do whatever crap you want to do.

707
00:55:45,625 --> 00:55:49,458
But before you go, 
do a nude photo-shoot for me.

708
00:55:49,541 --> 00:55:51,416
How dare you, you bloody rascal!

709
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:53,791
Who are you to ask me 
to do a nude photo-shoot?

710
00:55:54,125 --> 00:55:58,000
Who am I? I'm your husband 
and you are my property.

711
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:00,791
Don't you have any shame?

712
00:56:00,875 --> 00:56:03,375
You want your wife 
to do a nude photo-shoot?

713
00:56:04,166 --> 00:56:06,833
Even after knowing me, 
you thought I'll agree to it?

714
00:56:06,916 --> 00:56:07,750
You idiot!

715
00:56:09,583 --> 00:56:11,500
You won't agree. I know that.

716
00:56:17,166 --> 00:56:18,208
I've something for you.

717
00:56:30,625 --> 00:56:34,458
You believed me when I 
said I deleted the video, right?

718
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:37,458
I've many intimate videos of us.

719
00:56:38,083 --> 00:56:42,083
But I swear, I never thought 
I'll have to use them like this.

720
00:56:42,625 --> 00:56:43,833
If you want your honor intact..

721
00:56:44,291 --> 00:56:46,041
..do this shoot without making a scene.

722
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:48,916
I'm sure this will 
be the best ad in my life.

723
00:56:50,083 --> 00:56:53,625
If you want I can buy you 
ten children as remuneration.

724
00:56:54,416 --> 00:56:55,708
You can happily raise them.

725
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,166
Look, Vidya. If you shoot this ad..

726
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:00,916
..this photo will turn 
you into the best model.

727
00:57:01,791 --> 00:57:05,041
Or, that video will turn 
you into something else.

728
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,125
Think about it.

729
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:20,166
(Crying)

730
00:57:21,541 --> 00:57:26,916
Is he even a human? 
I won't spare him. I'll kill Rahul.

731
00:57:27,666 --> 00:57:32,250
(Claps hands)

732
00:57:35,125 --> 00:57:36,333
Das. 
- Sir.

733
00:57:36,416 --> 00:57:40,125
That tall man there, 
he's my wife's boyfriend.

734
00:57:40,541 --> 00:57:45,375
He says he'll kill me. 
Close the doors. Close the doors.

735
00:57:46,833 --> 00:57:48,041
You guard the doors.

736
00:57:48,125 --> 00:57:48,958
Yes, sir.

737
00:57:51,916 --> 00:57:58,125
You brought my son, 
I mean your boyfriend..

738
00:57:59,583 --> 00:58:01,375
..who is like a son, 
to kill me in my own house?

739
00:58:01,458 --> 00:58:04,041
You! Have you gone crazy?

740
00:58:04,416 --> 00:58:05,583
Das. 
- Sir?

741
00:58:05,875 --> 00:58:08,916
Why is he calling me crazy? Am I crazy?

742
00:58:10,958 --> 00:58:13,458
Am I crazy? 
- No, sir.

743
00:58:14,916 --> 00:58:15,750
Hmm.

744
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,625
Actually, Mr. Ganesh, I am crazy.

745
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:25,500
I'm crazy about my wife..

746
00:58:25,708 --> 00:58:29,375
..but you dared to come between us.

747
00:58:29,458 --> 00:58:30,541
Rahul! 
- Shut up!

748
00:58:40,333 --> 00:58:41,833
I'll kill you today!

749
00:58:42,125 --> 00:58:48,166
Vidya, he's going to kill me. 
Are you happy?

750
00:58:51,416 --> 00:58:52,250
Ganesh!

751
00:58:53,166 --> 00:58:54,166
Ganesh!

752
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:03,458
(Glass shatters)

753
00:59:06,375 --> 00:59:08,541
Am I crazy? Am I crazy?

754
00:59:17,833 --> 00:59:19,041
Ganesh!

755
00:59:21,041 --> 00:59:22,708
Ganesh, let him go, please.

756
00:59:25,958 --> 00:59:27,041
I will kill you!

757
00:59:28,791 --> 00:59:32,000
No! Ganesh! 
Ganesh! Please stop it! Please!

758
00:59:32,083 --> 00:59:33,166
You are going to be an IAS officer.

759
00:59:33,250 --> 00:59:34,416
Don't become a murderer by killing him.

760
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:35,375
Leave me, Vidya.

761
00:59:35,583 --> 00:59:37,375
How can I spare a 
man who did this to you?

762
00:59:37,458 --> 00:59:38,708
He should die. I will kill him.

763
00:59:38,791 --> 00:59:40,625
Ganesh, please. 
This is our family problem.

764
00:59:40,833 --> 00:59:42,125
Don't interfere in this matter.

765
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:43,875
But Vidya, he's dangerous.

766
00:59:43,958 --> 00:59:45,625
Ganesh, please. Get out of here.

767
00:59:45,708 --> 00:59:46,625
Vidya, he's a psycho..

768
00:59:46,708 --> 00:59:47,791
Please, get out. Get out I said.

769
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:49,333
Please listen to me. 
- Get out.

770
00:59:49,583 --> 00:59:50,625
Darn!

771
00:59:51,666 --> 00:59:53,041
Just get lost.

772
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:54,750
(Groans)

773
00:59:57,250 --> 00:59:58,208
(Door open)

774
01:00:05,041 --> 01:00:06,208
(Gasps)

775
01:00:06,291 --> 01:00:07,333
Sorry.

776
01:00:07,750 --> 01:00:08,875
I'm sorry.

777
01:00:09,916 --> 01:00:11,291
(Groans)

778
01:00:13,333 --> 01:00:14,375
Vidya..

779
01:00:15,708 --> 01:00:18,000
You were more concerned 
about his golden future..

780
01:00:18,791 --> 01:00:21,750
..than about him killing me.

781
01:00:24,708 --> 01:00:28,916
You are a true mother. True mother.

782
01:00:30,333 --> 01:00:35,000
But when we were bashing each other up..

783
01:00:35,416 --> 01:00:37,625
Hey, Ganesh! Oh, Rahul!

784
01:00:41,041 --> 01:00:43,416
What a performance!

785
01:00:45,125 --> 01:00:47,041
You are not an ordinary woman.

786
01:00:47,958 --> 01:00:49,625
You are a brilliant actress.

787
01:00:49,833 --> 01:00:51,791
Brilliant actress!

788
01:00:53,333 --> 01:00:57,583
If I let you go, 
you'll go and settle down with him.

789
01:01:00,916 --> 01:01:03,000
No. No.

790
01:01:04,083 --> 01:01:06,916
Rahul.. Rahul, don't.

791
01:01:09,166 --> 01:01:10,708
Please don't do it.

792
01:01:11,041 --> 01:01:13,500
He wanted to kill me 
with this knife, right?

793
01:01:13,583 --> 01:01:15,041
Rahul, please.

794
01:01:15,291 --> 01:01:16,750
(Groans)

795
01:01:17,291 --> 01:01:19,375
Rahul, don't harm me.

796
01:01:20,083 --> 01:01:20,833
Can you just come here?

797
01:01:20,916 --> 01:01:21,750
Please don't harm me.

798
01:01:21,833 --> 01:01:22,916
I won't harm you. 
- Please.

799
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,458
What are you saying? 
- No, Rahul.

800
01:01:26,625 --> 01:01:27,833
Rahul, please.

801
01:01:29,333 --> 01:01:30,708
I beg of you. Please.

802
01:01:30,791 --> 01:01:33,625
I'll stab you even harder 
if you irritate me. Come here.

803
01:01:33,791 --> 01:01:35,041
Don't harm me.

804
01:01:35,125 --> 01:01:35,958
Come here!

805
01:01:37,416 --> 01:01:38,916
Vidya! 
- (Thunder crashing)

806
01:01:59,375 --> 01:02:00,666
Vidya..

807
01:02:35,416 --> 01:02:36,625
Oh God! (Groans)

808
01:03:30,958 --> 01:03:34,708
(Wailing)

809
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:59,958
Smoke. Why is the 
house filled with smoke?

810
01:04:01,166 --> 01:04:02,750
Where is it coming from?

811
01:04:03,125 --> 01:04:04,583
Let's go check upstairs.

812
01:04:09,208 --> 01:04:10,958
(Coughs)

813
01:04:11,041 --> 01:04:12,083
There.

814
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:14,375
Right there.

815
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:19,291
Come on. 
Let's put the fire out. Hurry up.

816
01:04:20,875 --> 01:04:22,833
(Coughs)

817
01:04:52,375 --> 01:04:55,375
(Thunder crashing)

818
01:05:52,125 --> 01:05:54,125
(Thunder crashing)

819
01:05:59,750 --> 01:06:03,416
He's not a human being. 
He's a demon who ruined your life.

820
01:06:05,625 --> 01:06:07,291
What do you want to do now?

821
01:06:09,916 --> 01:06:11,750
My conscience won't allow it.

822
01:06:12,666 --> 01:06:16,083
I'll surrender to the 
police and confess my crime.

823
01:06:16,166 --> 01:06:17,291
Are you crazy?

824
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:20,041
The law requires proof, 
not a conscience.

825
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:23,375
90 percent cases are closed 
because of lack of evidence.

826
01:06:24,041 --> 01:06:27,375
Then, let's bury the body.

827
01:06:28,458 --> 01:06:32,041
No. Let's burn it.

828
01:06:32,458 --> 01:06:34,208
Then there will be no proof.

829
01:06:35,375 --> 01:06:37,625
Do you have any farmhouse 
far from the city?

830
01:06:37,833 --> 01:06:39,833
Yes. On the way to Chevalla.

831
01:06:40,333 --> 01:06:43,583
There's no watchman there right now. 
He's on leave.

832
01:06:43,791 --> 01:06:45,958
Let's take the body there 
in the car and burn it.

833
01:06:46,041 --> 01:06:49,083
The police are searching for us. 
How can we go out?

834
01:06:49,291 --> 01:06:51,750
There's no other way to save her.

835
01:06:52,375 --> 01:06:54,208
If we take the risk of getting there..

836
01:06:54,916 --> 01:06:56,333
..we can easily escape from there.

837
01:07:14,750 --> 01:07:16,541
Let's hide underneath 
so that nobody can see us.

838
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:18,416
You drive.

839
01:07:38,208 --> 01:07:39,375
Why did you stop?

840
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,416
The police are checking 
all the vehicles.

841
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:42,625
Police?

842
01:07:57,083 --> 01:07:58,916
It's ACP Narsimha.

843
01:08:04,041 --> 01:08:05,916
Turn around. Turn around.

844
01:08:09,833 --> 01:08:11,125
Oh no! Darn!

845
01:08:11,208 --> 01:08:15,041
Check all the vehicles. 
No vehicle should get away.

846
01:08:16,458 --> 01:08:18,958
We've to catch those three convicts.

847
01:08:19,416 --> 01:08:21,166
Hide. Come on, hide.

848
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:33,583
(Car alarm chirps)

849
01:08:46,625 --> 01:08:49,041
Why did she lock the 
car and where is she going?

850
01:08:55,583 --> 01:08:56,500
Excuse me, sir.

851
01:08:56,583 --> 01:08:57,416
Yes?

852
01:08:57,500 --> 01:09:00,250
A patient is in critical 
state in the hospital.

853
01:09:00,458 --> 01:09:03,541
He needs blood urgently. 
I've the same blood group.

854
01:09:04,625 --> 01:09:07,416
I'm in a hurry. Please let my car go.

855
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:10,583
Not possible. 
Three convicts escaped from the prison.

856
01:09:10,666 --> 01:09:12,250
We are searching for them.

857
01:09:12,791 --> 01:09:16,250
The ACP gave strict orders 
not to let any vehicle go.

858
01:09:16,333 --> 01:09:20,458
It's an emergency, sir. 
He'll die if I don't reach on time.

859
01:09:20,750 --> 01:09:21,750
Please, sir.

860
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:24,416
Okay. Write down your 
home address and details..

861
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:27,583
..in this register and sign it.

862
01:09:32,291 --> 01:09:33,375
304!

863
01:09:34,666 --> 01:09:35,416
Yes, sir!

864
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:37,250
Check this girl's 
car first and let her go.

865
01:09:40,291 --> 01:09:41,666
Come on, madam.

866
01:09:41,750 --> 01:09:42,708
Go with him.

867
01:09:42,791 --> 01:09:43,666
Come on, madam.

868
01:09:43,750 --> 01:09:44,583
Go on.

869
01:09:46,916 --> 01:09:48,000
Come on, hurry up.

870
01:09:49,291 --> 01:09:50,416
Hide.

871
01:09:58,625 --> 01:10:00,416
Open the lock. Come on.

872
01:10:03,666 --> 01:10:06,125
Open the trunk. 
How many times should I ask you?

873
01:10:06,416 --> 01:10:09,291
Come on, hurry. Open the lock.

874
01:10:10,666 --> 01:10:12,541
Come on, open the trunk.

875
01:10:14,250 --> 01:10:15,166
(Car alarm chirps)

876
01:10:18,375 --> 01:10:21,500
She's in a hurry to go to the hospital.

877
01:10:21,583 --> 01:10:24,000
Yes, sir. 
- Don't you have humanity?

878
01:10:24,083 --> 01:10:25,083
Sir.

879
01:10:25,250 --> 01:10:27,500
This is why people 
don't respect policemen.

880
01:10:28,208 --> 01:10:30,833
Chewing betel leaves 
has affected your mind.

881
01:10:32,666 --> 01:10:36,291
Does she look like a killer 
or an accomplice to convicts?

882
01:10:36,833 --> 01:10:37,625
Use your brain.

883
01:10:37,666 --> 01:10:39,500
Go on, dear. Take your car. 
- Thank you, sir.

884
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:47,583
Come on, make way for this car.

885
01:10:53,666 --> 01:10:55,208
(Brakes squeal)

886
01:11:27,125 --> 01:11:29,583
(Crying)

887
01:11:34,791 --> 01:11:38,708
The man who tormented 
you is burning in those flames.

888
01:11:39,708 --> 01:11:45,291
Let your past burn with 
him and start a new life.

889
01:11:46,375 --> 01:11:47,291
Come on.

890
01:12:56,666 --> 01:12:58,541
(Gasps)

891
01:13:02,583 --> 01:13:05,291
(Phone rings)

892
01:13:05,375 --> 01:13:07,791
(Gasps) 
- (Phone rings)

893
01:13:15,083 --> 01:13:19,416
(Clock ticking)

894
01:13:26,041 --> 01:13:30,541
(Phone rings)

895
01:13:46,541 --> 01:13:47,250
Hello.

896
01:13:47,291 --> 01:13:49,583
(Laughs)

897
01:13:49,916 --> 01:13:54,166
What? Were you sleeping? 
How can you sleep?

898
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:57,166
Who are you?

899
01:13:57,250 --> 01:14:00,416
We can talk about my 
name and address later.

900
01:14:00,666 --> 01:14:03,916
First let's talk about 
the dead body that was burnt..

901
01:14:04,125 --> 01:14:05,458
..at the farmhouse, alright?

902
01:14:17,916 --> 01:14:18,875
What do you want?

903
01:14:18,916 --> 01:14:21,583
Good. Right to the point.

904
01:14:21,791 --> 01:14:25,916
I'll call again to tell 
you what I want and where to come.

905
01:14:28,958 --> 01:14:29,791
(Door bell rings)

906
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,416
(Door bell rings)

907
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:39,000
(Door bell rings)

908
01:14:45,541 --> 01:14:47,791
Looks like you didn't sleep all night.

909
01:14:48,125 --> 01:14:50,250
You had a headache after all.

910
01:14:50,583 --> 01:14:56,458
I sat at my window all 
night thinking about you..

911
01:14:56,958 --> 01:15:00,000
..and looking at your house.

912
01:15:00,541 --> 01:15:02,416
Is your fever gone?

913
01:15:02,625 --> 01:15:04,375
Are you afraid that I'll get it too?

914
01:15:04,458 --> 01:15:05,500
Should I bring you tablets?

915
01:15:05,583 --> 01:15:07,083
I've no such problems. Just go.

916
01:15:07,750 --> 01:15:11,250
You are too shy, dear. Make use of me.

917
01:15:11,458 --> 01:15:12,291
Should I call your wife?

918
01:15:12,375 --> 01:15:13,833
(Phone rings)

919
01:15:13,916 --> 01:15:15,625
Here, she's calling me.

920
01:15:15,833 --> 01:15:17,875
Should I reject it, or answer it?

921
01:15:17,958 --> 01:15:19,833
Please leave. Get out. 
- Wait.

922
01:15:24,791 --> 01:15:28,041
(Phone rings)

923
01:15:30,083 --> 01:15:32,291
What? Are you worried?

924
01:15:32,833 --> 01:15:35,416
I won't ask stupid questions 
like why did you kill him..

925
01:15:35,708 --> 01:15:39,208
..or how did you kill him? 
I just want money.

926
01:15:39,291 --> 01:15:43,708
I'll tell you when and where I want it. 
Listen carefully. - (Door bell rings)

927
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:45,666
Don't you have any shame?

928
01:15:47,791 --> 01:15:48,375
Sorry.

929
01:15:48,458 --> 01:15:49,833
Why aren't you answering 
your phone, ma'am?

930
01:15:49,916 --> 01:15:50,791
Huh?

931
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,500
Sir gave me his phone 
last night and forgot about it.

932
01:15:54,416 --> 01:15:57,541
I was calling to tell 
you that but you didn't answer.

933
01:15:57,750 --> 01:15:59,416
So I came here to give it to you.

934
01:16:06,875 --> 01:16:08,416
Sir is still sleeping.

935
01:16:08,458 --> 01:16:09,583
Sleeping?

936
01:16:10,958 --> 01:16:12,750
I'll give it to him. You can go.

937
01:16:20,541 --> 01:16:24,750
(Door bell rings)

938
01:16:25,875 --> 01:16:29,125
Do you think this is a game? 
Why did you cut the call?

939
01:16:30,375 --> 01:16:34,500
I had to disconnect because 
somebody else called.

940
01:16:35,083 --> 01:16:39,416
If you don't want me to inform 
the police about the murder..

941
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:41,666
..you should give me 2.5 million rupees.

942
01:16:43,166 --> 01:16:45,791
My little girl is getting 
treated for cancer.

943
01:16:46,250 --> 01:16:47,416
I'll need 2.5 million rupees.

944
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:48,833
Are you listening to me?

945
01:16:49,166 --> 01:16:51,458
Yes, please tell me. I'm listening.

946
01:16:51,541 --> 01:16:53,750
I'll tell you where I 
want you to bring the money.

947
01:16:53,833 --> 01:16:55,000
Listen carefully.

948
01:16:55,375 --> 01:16:57,541
There's an aluminum 
factory outside the city.

949
01:16:58,041 --> 01:16:59,625
Come to the 4th shed there.

950
01:17:00,083 --> 01:17:02,750
If you try any tricks with me..

951
01:17:10,333 --> 01:17:11,500
It's definitely him.

952
01:17:19,291 --> 01:17:22,666
(Locker beeps)

953
01:17:30,333 --> 01:17:35,000
(Phone rings)

954
01:18:22,833 --> 01:18:24,666
(Brakes squeal)

955
01:18:27,666 --> 01:18:29,416
(Phone rings)

956
01:18:31,333 --> 01:18:34,625
Hello. Take a right and walk straight.

957
01:20:22,666 --> 01:20:25,125
Do you want a betel leaf to chew?

958
01:20:26,875 --> 01:20:29,375
Or you can eat betel nuts.

959
01:20:34,166 --> 01:20:38,500
Yes, sir. Yes. Yes.

960
01:20:38,708 --> 01:20:40,875
We caught him red-handed.

961
01:20:41,625 --> 01:20:45,958
I'll keep updating you, sir. 
Thank you, sir.

962
01:20:47,541 --> 01:20:49,166
(Laughs)

963
01:20:51,666 --> 01:20:54,708
She's in a hurry to go to the hospital.

964
01:20:54,791 --> 01:20:55,500
Yes, sir.

965
01:20:55,583 --> 01:20:56,916
Don't you have humanity?

966
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:57,625
Sir.

967
01:20:57,708 --> 01:21:00,750
This is why people 
don't respect policemen.

968
01:21:00,958 --> 01:21:01,791
Use your brain.

969
01:21:02,458 --> 01:21:03,708
Go on, dear. Take your car.

970
01:21:03,791 --> 01:21:04,666
Thank you, sir.

971
01:21:04,750 --> 01:21:08,416
Don't chew leaves like a goat. 
Get to work.

972
01:21:09,333 --> 01:21:10,166
What's the issue?

973
01:21:10,250 --> 01:21:11,166
Nothing, sir. 
- Sir.

974
01:21:11,250 --> 01:21:12,791
She was in a hurry 
to get to the hospital.

975
01:21:12,875 --> 01:21:14,250
So we checked her car and let her go.

976
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:18,208
He lied to you and 
followed her car, sir.

977
01:21:18,291 --> 01:21:20,833
(Police siren wails)

978
01:21:23,833 --> 01:21:26,125
(Police siren wails)

979
01:21:26,208 --> 01:21:27,875
Then, he came back after some time..

980
01:21:28,166 --> 01:21:30,791
..and clicked a photo 
of her details in the register.

981
01:21:32,416 --> 01:21:34,333
Keep an eye on him.

982
01:21:36,416 --> 01:21:41,250
Do you want a betel leaf to chew?

983
01:21:42,708 --> 01:21:46,583
Or you can eat betel nuts.

984
01:21:47,125 --> 01:21:48,375
(Laughs)

985
01:21:48,833 --> 01:21:50,416
Is the shock too much for you?

986
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:53,333
I'll kill you. Don't you 
have any other dialogues to say?

987
01:21:59,958 --> 01:22:00,916
He's attacking me.

988
01:22:02,041 --> 01:22:04,041
You should be ashamed of what you did.

989
01:22:04,125 --> 01:22:05,791
How dare you attack him?

990
01:22:07,041 --> 01:22:08,291
What's your relationship with that girl?

991
01:22:11,625 --> 01:22:12,916
Open the trunk.

992
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,583
When our constable 
wanted to check her car..

993
01:22:15,833 --> 01:22:18,833
..I noticed blood 
dripping from the trunk.

994
01:22:19,250 --> 01:22:22,125
I saw the anxiety in her face and 
became suspicious. - (Car alarm chirps)

995
01:22:22,208 --> 01:22:23,958
I stopped him from 
opening her car's trunk..

996
01:22:24,041 --> 01:22:27,625
..let her car go and followed her.

997
01:22:32,833 --> 01:22:34,333
(Horn blares)

998
01:22:35,958 --> 01:22:37,791
You idiot!

999
01:22:48,166 --> 01:22:50,125
When I was searching 
for the missing car..

1000
01:22:50,333 --> 01:22:52,500
..I saw it leaving a farmhouse.

1001
01:22:52,791 --> 01:22:54,958
I found it suspicious 
and went into the farmhouse.

1002
01:23:01,125 --> 01:23:04,416
I saw a dead body burning.

1003
01:23:05,041 --> 01:23:09,125
I assumed that the girl 
had something to do with it.

1004
01:23:09,666 --> 01:23:11,375
I returned to the check-post..

1005
01:23:11,625 --> 01:23:14,416
..took her phone number 
and details from the register..

1006
01:23:14,625 --> 01:23:16,125
..and called her.

1007
01:23:16,333 --> 01:23:18,250
The fear in her voice confirmed..

1008
01:23:18,458 --> 01:23:20,583
..that she committed a crime.

1009
01:23:21,125 --> 01:23:24,125
I called her again and 
asked her for 2.5 million rupees.

1010
01:23:24,166 --> 01:23:27,458
Cops like you are a 
disgrace to our department.

1011
01:23:28,250 --> 01:23:29,208
Keep him in remand.

1012
01:23:29,291 --> 01:23:31,250
Please overlook it just this once, sir. 
- Bhaskar!

1013
01:23:42,166 --> 01:23:44,416
Madam! Sir wants to talk to you. 
Come inside.

1014
01:23:44,666 --> 01:23:46,666
The CI was talking about a farmhouse..

1015
01:23:46,916 --> 01:23:48,583
..and a dead body that was burnt. 
What's the story?

1016
01:23:48,750 --> 01:23:50,458
He is right, sir.

1017
01:23:51,583 --> 01:23:54,416
I burnt my husband's 
dead body at the farmhouse.

1018
01:23:56,333 --> 01:23:57,416
I killed him.

1019
01:23:57,500 --> 01:24:01,250
You killed your husband? Who was he?

1020
01:24:01,708 --> 01:24:03,166
Ad film maker Rahul.

1021
01:24:05,333 --> 01:24:08,291
Ad film maker Rahul is your husband?

1022
01:24:08,375 --> 01:24:10,750
Bhaskar! Raju! Ashwath!

1023
01:24:11,416 --> 01:24:14,125
Bhaskar, take a team to 
ad film maker Rahul's house.

1024
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:15,083
That's a crime scene.

1025
01:24:15,166 --> 01:24:17,458
Ashwath, inform the forensic department.

1026
01:24:17,541 --> 01:24:19,250
Search every inch of that house.

1027
01:24:19,333 --> 01:24:20,708
Don't miss any evidences.

1028
01:24:21,041 --> 01:24:22,958
Understand? Come on, get going.

1029
01:24:23,041 --> 01:24:24,166
Go.

1030
01:24:29,166 --> 01:24:33,666
(Camera clicks)

1031
01:25:03,666 --> 01:25:07,833
(Phone rings)

1032
01:25:13,833 --> 01:25:15,833
You can go. I'll see it later. 
- Okay, sir.

1033
01:25:15,916 --> 01:25:19,875
(Phone rings)

1034
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:31,875
Who is this Ganesh?

1035
01:25:32,708 --> 01:25:33,750
Answer me!

1036
01:25:34,666 --> 01:25:38,375
A friend. 
- Just a friend or a boyfriend?

1037
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:41,750
Answer it.

1038
01:25:44,291 --> 01:25:45,250
Put it on speaker.

1039
01:25:47,208 --> 01:25:50,583
Hello? Hello, Vidya. I've been calling 
you continuously since last night.

1040
01:25:50,916 --> 01:25:51,958
Why aren't you answering my calls?

1041
01:25:52,041 --> 01:25:55,625
After the fight last night, I 
was so worried that Rahul will harm you.

1042
01:25:56,500 --> 01:25:58,208
Hello? Hello, Vidya?

1043
01:25:58,291 --> 01:25:58,958
I'll talk to you later.

1044
01:25:59,041 --> 01:26:00,541
What happened? Vidya, tell me please.

1045
01:26:00,625 --> 01:26:01,416
Who are you?

1046
01:26:01,875 --> 01:26:04,333
Who am I? Who are you?

1047
01:26:04,416 --> 01:26:09,333
Police. Assistant 
Commissioner of Police.

1048
01:26:09,833 --> 01:26:11,083
Narsimha.

1049
01:26:11,541 --> 01:26:15,541
Sorry, sir. 
I'm Ganesh. Where is Vidya right now?

1050
01:26:15,833 --> 01:26:17,291
In police custody.

1051
01:26:26,833 --> 01:26:29,916
No, sir. No complications. 
I think we can handle it.

1052
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:30,625
Not at all, sir.

1053
01:26:30,666 --> 01:26:33,291
Hello, sir. 
- Hello, sir. I'm Ganesh.

1054
01:26:33,791 --> 01:26:34,916
What are those bruises?

1055
01:26:37,666 --> 01:26:38,708
What do you do?

1056
01:26:38,958 --> 01:26:39,791
Sir?

1057
01:26:40,041 --> 01:26:41,291
What do you do?

1058
01:26:44,125 --> 01:26:47,083
I completed my Civils, sir. 
Waiting for posting.

1059
01:26:49,125 --> 01:26:52,583
Future IPS. IAS.

1060
01:26:59,625 --> 01:27:01,791
Sir, where is our Vidya?

1061
01:27:03,916 --> 01:27:04,916
In interrogation.

1062
01:27:05,833 --> 01:27:06,916
What actually happened, sir?

1063
01:27:07,208 --> 01:27:08,750
She killed her husband.

1064
01:27:10,041 --> 01:27:11,291
Murder?

1065
01:27:11,708 --> 01:27:16,000
She killed Rahul? 
Impossible. That's impossible, sir.

1066
01:27:16,583 --> 01:27:17,916
She's not that kind of a girl.

1067
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:18,875
Hey!

1068
01:27:19,291 --> 01:27:20,958
She confessed to the murder.

1069
01:27:21,125 --> 01:27:23,666
Please give me a chance to talk to her.

1070
01:27:23,958 --> 01:27:25,833
I'll find out what happened.

1071
01:27:26,208 --> 01:27:27,583
Okay. 
- Thank you, sir.

1072
01:27:27,625 --> 01:27:28,916
Five minutes.

1073
01:27:31,791 --> 01:27:32,708
Vidya!

1074
01:27:39,041 --> 01:27:41,666
Is the ACP telling the truth?

1075
01:27:43,708 --> 01:27:45,291
You killed Rahul?

1076
01:27:47,333 --> 01:27:50,541
No, I don't believe it. 
I don't believe it.

1077
01:27:51,375 --> 01:27:54,083
The police believed me. 
Get out of here right now.

1078
01:27:54,166 --> 01:27:58,333
Don't be stupid. 
I can't leave you in this situation.

1079
01:27:59,166 --> 01:28:01,458
I'll talk to the lawyers 
and get you a bail.

1080
01:28:01,916 --> 01:28:03,916
Go and tell the ACP 
that you were in shock..

1081
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:05,708
..and didn't know what you were saying.

1082
01:28:07,083 --> 01:28:10,791
After that? 
They'll find that you are the murderer.

1083
01:28:12,541 --> 01:28:14,875
Will you go to jail instead 
of becoming a Collector?

1084
01:28:15,916 --> 01:28:17,416
Why will I be put in prison?

1085
01:28:18,041 --> 01:28:20,250
Because you killed Rahul.

1086
01:28:20,833 --> 01:28:21,708
What?

1087
01:28:22,916 --> 01:28:24,125
I killed Rahul?

1088
01:28:24,333 --> 01:28:30,125
Yes. I saw you jumping over 
the gate after you killed him.

1089
01:28:30,833 --> 01:28:33,541
What? I jumped over the gate?

1090
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
There is some confusion, Vidya.

1091
01:28:38,166 --> 01:28:41,000
I was so angry last night 
that I would've killed him..

1092
01:28:41,958 --> 01:28:43,583
..then and there if 
you hadn't stopped me.

1093
01:28:44,791 --> 01:28:47,833
You stopped me and asked me to get out.

1094
01:28:47,916 --> 01:28:52,750
After I left, 
I didn't even look back at your house.

1095
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:57,416
How can you say that I killed Rahul?

1096
01:29:00,166 --> 01:29:04,500
Then, it wasn't you who killed Rahul?

1097
01:29:04,708 --> 01:29:05,541
No.

1098
01:29:13,958 --> 01:29:20,541
Then, who killed Rahul 
and jumped over the gate?

1099
01:29:38,916 --> 01:29:40,416
I didn't kill my husband, sir.

1100
01:29:40,666 --> 01:29:42,500
Are you both staging a new drama?

1101
01:29:42,750 --> 01:29:44,291
She thought I killed Rahul..

1102
01:29:44,375 --> 01:29:48,500
..so she took the blame 
for it to save me. She's innocent.

1103
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,083
If you want, 
you can take me into custody..

1104
01:29:51,166 --> 01:29:53,375
..until you find the real killer.

1105
01:30:00,166 --> 01:30:01,916
If you want us to find 
out who the real killer is..

1106
01:30:02,125 --> 01:30:05,208
..you've to tell me what 
really happened after Ganesh left.

1107
01:30:11,666 --> 01:30:13,416
Oh God! (Groans)

1108
01:30:30,500 --> 01:30:34,291
Vidya! Vidya! 
(Banging on door)

1109
01:30:37,625 --> 01:30:42,041
Vidya! Open the door! Open the door!

1110
01:30:56,375 --> 01:30:58,916
After a while, 
the banging on the door stopped.

1111
01:31:00,500 --> 01:31:03,458
I hesitantly opened 
the back door and went out.

1112
01:31:13,583 --> 01:31:16,000
(Thunder crashing)

1113
01:31:27,583 --> 01:31:29,916
(Thunder crashing)

1114
01:31:49,250 --> 01:31:50,583
(Gasps)

1115
01:32:16,750 --> 01:32:20,083
(Crying)

1116
01:32:43,916 --> 01:32:48,666
I noticed the blood drops and 
fearfully looked out of the window.

1117
01:32:49,208 --> 01:32:51,625
I saw a man jump over the gate and run.

1118
01:32:52,916 --> 01:32:54,458
(Thunder crashing)

1119
01:33:22,375 --> 01:33:25,541
I thought that Ganesh 
came back to save me..

1120
01:33:28,208 --> 01:33:31,916
..killed Ganesh, 
jumped over the gate and escaped.

1121
01:33:33,500 --> 01:33:35,541
My life was already ruined.

1122
01:33:38,416 --> 01:33:40,791
I didn't want Ganesh's 
future to be ruined too..

1123
01:33:41,125 --> 01:33:42,666
..so I took the blame for it.

1124
01:33:44,666 --> 01:33:48,708
I lied to you that I killed my husband.

1125
01:33:51,875 --> 01:33:54,916
If it wasn't either of you, 
who really killed Rahul?

1126
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:58,541
(Phone rings)

1127
01:33:59,625 --> 01:34:00,333
Tell me.

1128
01:34:00,416 --> 01:34:02,416
We found a bloodied 
knife outside the house.

1129
01:34:02,625 --> 01:34:04,208
Send it to the forensic lab immediately.

1130
01:34:04,291 --> 01:34:05,125
Okay, sir.

1131
01:34:05,791 --> 01:34:07,416
Prakash! 
- Sir!

1132
01:34:07,833 --> 01:34:10,166
Take the fingerprints of these two, 
the guy in my room..

1133
01:34:10,250 --> 01:34:12,958
..and that man Abbas Paul. 
- Sir.

1134
01:34:13,041 --> 01:34:14,041
They found a knife on the crime scene.

1135
01:34:14,125 --> 01:34:17,333
Check if any of their 
prints match the ones on it.

1136
01:34:17,666 --> 01:34:19,208
I want the reports immediately. 
Understand?

1137
01:34:19,291 --> 01:34:20,291
Okay, sir.

1138
01:34:42,416 --> 01:34:45,750
None of their prints 
match the ones on the knife.

1139
01:34:46,625 --> 01:34:49,375
We did further comparison 
in our bureau too.

1140
01:34:51,458 --> 01:34:52,791
Are you sure? 
- Yes, sir.

1141
01:34:53,083 --> 01:34:54,375
Thank you. 
- Welcome.

1142
01:35:16,666 --> 01:35:18,375
Was there somebody else there..

1143
01:35:18,958 --> 01:35:20,333
..when your husband 
was fighting with him?

1144
01:35:24,208 --> 01:35:27,958
He says he'll kill me. 
Close the doors. Close the doors.

1145
01:35:28,708 --> 01:35:31,166
Yes. Rahul's manager 
Das came home with him.

1146
01:35:31,375 --> 01:35:34,250
Was he still there when 
they both were fighting?

1147
01:35:35,666 --> 01:35:37,208
I didn't notice it, sir.

1148
01:35:39,416 --> 01:35:41,041
Do you have Das's phone number?

1149
01:35:41,125 --> 01:35:42,125
Yes, sir.

1150
01:35:43,541 --> 01:35:44,625
Call him.

1151
01:35:50,166 --> 01:35:53,291
The number you are trying 
to call is currently not reachable.

1152
01:35:53,375 --> 01:35:55,208
There's no doubt about it. 
It must be him.

1153
01:35:55,416 --> 01:35:58,000
None of your prints matched 
the ones on the knife.

1154
01:35:58,333 --> 01:36:00,833
I'm sure Das is the real killer.

1155
01:36:02,041 --> 01:36:02,666
Bhaskar! 
- Sir.

1156
01:36:02,750 --> 01:36:03,750
Prakash! 
- Sir.

1157
01:36:04,041 --> 01:36:07,166
Arrest that manager Das right away. 
Don't let him escape.

1158
01:36:07,250 --> 01:36:08,458
Come on, go.

1159
01:36:10,666 --> 01:36:11,375
Excuse me.

1160
01:36:11,458 --> 01:36:11,916
Yes?

1161
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:13,583
A little girl named Vaishnavi. 
Which ward is she in?

1162
01:36:13,666 --> 01:36:15,541
They were discharged early 
in the morning today. - Thank you.

1163
01:36:15,625 --> 01:36:17,500
(Police siren wails)

1164
01:36:23,291 --> 01:36:26,375
(Phone rings)

1165
01:36:27,541 --> 01:36:28,458
Yes, Bhaskar.

1166
01:36:28,541 --> 01:36:30,125
He's not at the hospital. 
His house is locked.

1167
01:36:30,208 --> 01:36:31,000
He has escaped.

1168
01:36:31,166 --> 01:36:31,958
Darn!

1169
01:36:32,458 --> 01:36:34,333
It's him! Definitely him!

1170
01:36:34,500 --> 01:36:37,541
Question his family, 
relatives and friends.

1171
01:36:37,625 --> 01:36:38,791
Don't leave anyone out.

1172
01:36:38,875 --> 01:36:41,750
Check all vehicles going 
out and coming into the city.

1173
01:36:41,833 --> 01:36:43,416
Alert all the check-posts.

1174
01:36:43,791 --> 01:36:46,208
Railway stations, bus stands, airport..

1175
01:36:46,291 --> 01:36:49,500
..I want our men checking 
all the places. I've to find him.

1176
01:37:02,375 --> 01:37:06,375
Sir, can we go?

1177
01:37:07,041 --> 01:37:10,333
Of course. If you wait half an hour..

1178
01:37:10,708 --> 01:37:12,541
..we'll arrange a music 
band to play music..

1179
01:37:12,625 --> 01:37:13,791
..and come as a procession 
to leave you at home.

1180
01:37:15,083 --> 01:37:18,416
India's most famous 
photographer was murdered.

1181
01:37:18,833 --> 01:37:22,041
He was a VIP. 
Do you know how serious this case is?

1182
01:37:23,625 --> 01:37:25,541
I can't let you go just 
because the forensic reports..

1183
01:37:25,625 --> 01:37:29,541
..suggest that you don't 
have anything to do with it.

1184
01:37:30,500 --> 01:37:33,208
You are the culprits until 
we catch the real culprit.

1185
01:37:40,875 --> 01:37:43,250
When I saw the risk you 
took to save your friend..

1186
01:37:44,208 --> 01:37:45,875
..I saw myself in you.

1187
01:37:47,916 --> 01:37:51,541
So I'll take a personal 
risk and let you go home.

1188
01:37:51,625 --> 01:37:52,708
Thank you, sir.

1189
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:53,916
Thank you, sir.

1190
01:37:56,333 --> 01:37:57,333
Thank you, sir.

1191
01:38:23,416 --> 01:38:25,375
Ganesh, you both go home.

1192
01:38:25,625 --> 01:38:29,416
How can we leave you 
alone in this situation?

1193
01:38:29,833 --> 01:38:31,875
Please. I want to be alone.

1194
01:39:02,500 --> 01:39:03,916
(Phone chimes)

1195
01:39:18,833 --> 01:39:20,833
Why did he send a text to Rahul's phone?

1196
01:39:52,458 --> 01:39:53,375
(Brakes squeal)

1197
01:40:02,375 --> 01:40:03,291
(Door bell rings)

1198
01:40:06,083 --> 01:40:06,875
(Door bell rings)

1199
01:40:08,958 --> 01:40:09,708
(Door knocks)

1200
01:40:12,750 --> 01:40:17,041
(Door creaks)

1201
01:40:26,833 --> 01:40:27,958
Sir?

1202
01:40:32,416 --> 01:40:33,500
Sir!

1203
01:40:55,916 --> 01:40:56,708
You guys?

1204
01:41:00,500 --> 01:41:03,375
Did you come to tell the ACP about us?

1205
01:41:03,666 --> 01:41:06,708
Yes. I came to find out 
what is actually going on..

1206
01:41:06,916 --> 01:41:08,625
..and ask the ACP about you.

1207
01:41:09,083 --> 01:41:09,833
What will you ask him?

1208
01:41:09,916 --> 01:41:13,541
How does the ACP know my husband?

1209
01:41:21,125 --> 01:41:23,250
I came to ask him about 
the connection between..

1210
01:41:23,625 --> 01:41:26,166
..my husband, Meghana and the ACP.

1211
01:41:33,333 --> 01:41:36,750
And what's the connection 
between those three and you three?

1212
01:41:42,166 --> 01:41:44,125
I thought you heard my story.

1213
01:41:44,416 --> 01:41:47,041
But now I know that 
I was a part of your story.

1214
01:41:48,333 --> 01:41:50,458
I selected Meghana for the photo-shoot..

1215
01:41:51,333 --> 01:41:54,333
..and then she died after two days. How?

1216
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:59,708
Please tell me at least now. 
What actually happened?

1217
01:42:05,250 --> 01:42:07,625
In your story, 
you accidentally became the victim.

1218
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:12,750
But in Meghana's story, 
she unwittingly became a victim.

1219
01:42:13,875 --> 01:42:15,875
We were born and brought 
up in different places..

1220
01:42:16,375 --> 01:42:17,541
..but accidentally found each other.

1221
01:42:17,875 --> 01:42:19,500
That was our life. One day..

1222
01:42:22,833 --> 01:42:23,875
Where were you last night?

1223
01:42:23,958 --> 01:42:25,000
Why didn't you answer any calls?

1224
01:42:34,916 --> 01:42:35,791
Who is she?

1225
01:42:36,500 --> 01:42:39,625
I told you about her. 
She left home with a suitcase.

1226
01:42:39,916 --> 01:42:41,458
So I brought her to our room.

1227
01:42:41,625 --> 01:42:43,041
Okay, let's go inside.

1228
01:42:43,125 --> 01:42:44,500
Wait a minute.

1229
01:42:44,916 --> 01:42:45,791
Where are you going?

1230
01:42:45,875 --> 01:42:47,416
Let's go to the temple 
first and get you two married.

1231
01:42:47,708 --> 01:42:49,958
Hello! I'm not going to marry anyone.

1232
01:42:50,458 --> 01:42:53,833
I want to be the No. 
1 model in India. That's my aim.

1233
01:42:54,666 --> 01:42:56,041
I promise you this as an older brother.

1234
01:42:56,416 --> 01:43:00,000
We are here to fulfill 
all your dreams and ambitions.

1235
01:43:06,416 --> 01:43:10,541
(Music)

1236
01:43:28,916 --> 01:43:33,666
"We'll place the skies in your palms"

1237
01:43:34,166 --> 01:43:39,083
"We'll fill your eyes 
with joy and happiness"

1238
01:43:39,166 --> 01:43:48,583
"We'll lay our lives 
for you if you ever ask"

1239
01:43:49,916 --> 01:43:54,916
(Music)

1240
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:59,375
"We don't have any specific dreams"

1241
01:44:00,333 --> 01:44:05,250
"Even if we do, 
we'll put them aside for your dreams"

1242
01:44:05,583 --> 01:44:10,875
"We don't have other 
things to bring us joy"

1243
01:44:11,125 --> 01:44:15,333
"Even if we do, 
we'll forget them for your smiles"

1244
01:44:15,791 --> 01:44:20,625
"We'll place the skies in your palms"

1245
01:44:21,041 --> 01:44:25,750
"We'll fill your eyes 
with joy and happiness"

1246
01:44:26,250 --> 01:44:35,041
"We'll lay our lives 
for you if you ever ask"

1247
01:44:36,625 --> 01:44:41,208
(Music)

1248
01:44:49,750 --> 01:44:50,458
Hello.

1249
01:44:51,375 --> 01:44:52,875
Your Meghana has been selected.

1250
01:44:53,916 --> 01:44:56,416
Puneet! Adwith! Meghana! 
- What's the matter?

1251
01:44:56,791 --> 01:45:00,958
Meghana, congrats! 
She got selected for the ad campaign.

1252
01:45:01,291 --> 01:45:02,833
Oh. Congrats, Meghana!

1253
01:45:02,916 --> 01:45:04,208
Come on, hurry up and go.

1254
01:45:04,833 --> 01:45:08,958
I won't go. 
How can I leave you in this state?

1255
01:45:09,583 --> 01:45:11,166
That's not more important than you.

1256
01:45:11,250 --> 01:45:13,458
(Music)

1257
01:45:21,125 --> 01:45:26,250
"Your dreams and ambitions are ours"

1258
01:45:26,333 --> 01:45:30,083
"We'll give life to 
them like a rising sun"

1259
01:45:31,458 --> 01:45:36,666
"Your paths and journeys are ours"

1260
01:45:36,750 --> 01:45:41,375
"We'll guard you on your way"

1261
01:45:41,875 --> 01:45:47,000
"No matter what your fun may cost us"

1262
01:45:47,083 --> 01:45:51,541
"We'll happily bear it for you"

1263
01:45:51,833 --> 01:45:57,541
"No matter how far 
your goals and dreams are"

1264
01:45:57,750 --> 01:46:01,541
"We'll capture them for you"

1265
01:46:02,708 --> 01:46:07,625
"We'll become horses with wings for you"

1266
01:46:07,791 --> 01:46:12,708
"We'll carry you into 
a world filled with colors"

1267
01:46:13,208 --> 01:46:18,083

1268
01:46:18,458 --> 01:46:22,958
"We'll fill your eyes 
with joy and happiness"

1269
01:46:23,625 --> 01:46:32,833
"We'll lay our lives 
for you if you ever ask"

1270

(Music)

1271
01:46:41,916 --> 01:46:43,500
Sir has finalized Meghana.

1272
01:46:43,750 --> 01:46:45,458
Bring her here at 10:00 am tomorrow.

1273
01:46:51,166 --> 01:46:53,541
(Camera clicks)

1274
01:47:03,875 --> 01:47:05,166
(Claps hands)

1275
01:47:05,250 --> 01:47:06,750
Good job, guys. Good job.

1276
01:47:11,250 --> 01:47:13,583
Alright, everyone go outside. Quick.

1277
01:47:14,750 --> 01:47:16,041
Go, go, go. Leave the set.

1278
01:47:16,125 --> 01:47:16,791
How are you feeling? 
- I'm so happy.

1279
01:47:16,875 --> 01:47:17,500
Meghana?

1280
01:47:18,250 --> 01:47:19,416
Meghana, please come.

1281
01:47:20,583 --> 01:47:21,875
All the best. 
- Thank you.

1282
01:47:22,333 --> 01:47:23,833
All the best. 
- Thank you.

1283
01:47:24,041 --> 01:47:25,291
All the best. 
- Thanks.

1284
01:47:38,375 --> 01:47:41,583
(Camera clicks)

1285
01:47:42,041 --> 01:47:42,791
Nice.

1286
01:47:46,458 --> 01:47:47,541
Hi, sir. 
- (Camera clicks)

1287
01:47:50,625 --> 01:47:51,666
(Camera clicks)

1288
01:47:55,916 --> 01:47:57,125
Do you need a special invitation?

1289
01:47:57,208 --> 01:47:58,125
Sir? 
- Get out.

1290
01:47:58,875 --> 01:48:00,375
Sorry, sir. 
- Come, come.

1291
01:48:08,041 --> 01:48:09,958
Come. Just stand here like that.

1292
01:48:11,916 --> 01:48:13,583
(Camera clicks)

1293
01:48:13,666 --> 01:48:15,041
Nice. Looking good, man.

1294
01:48:15,916 --> 01:48:18,625
Sir, modeling is my dream.

1295
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:22,875
My first photo-shoot with 
a legendary photographer like you..

1296
01:48:23,625 --> 01:48:26,416
I can't believe it. I'm so happy.

1297
01:48:26,875 --> 01:48:27,625
That's okay.

1298
01:48:28,500 --> 01:48:29,208
Meghana, right?

1299
01:48:29,291 --> 01:48:29,916
Yeah.

1300
01:48:30,333 --> 01:48:32,208
There's jewelry in that box. 
Just wear it.

1301
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:41,916
Wow.

1302
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:51,625
Sir..

1303
01:48:56,041 --> 01:48:57,500
Good. Nice.

1304
01:48:57,958 --> 01:49:00,541
Just keep that and remove the dress.

1305
01:49:02,833 --> 01:49:03,916
I didn't get you, sir.

1306
01:49:06,625 --> 01:49:07,541
What didn't you get?

1307
01:49:09,458 --> 01:49:10,666
Don't you know this 
is a nude photo-shoot?

1308
01:49:13,416 --> 01:49:14,250
No.

1309
01:49:14,333 --> 01:49:16,166
Keep the necklace 
and take out the dress.

1310
01:49:16,208 --> 01:49:17,750
I'm running out of time, make it quick.

1311
01:49:18,416 --> 01:49:24,166
I can't do it, sir. I didn't 
know about it. I can't. I'm sorry.

1312
01:49:24,375 --> 01:49:26,000
I don't know why you 
are making a scene out of it.

1313
01:49:26,416 --> 01:49:29,750
I'm just trying to 
show the way you are. Okay?

1314
01:49:29,958 --> 01:49:31,500
I'm not shooting 
pornography here. Just..

1315
01:49:31,583 --> 01:49:32,333
No!

1316
01:49:33,250 --> 01:49:34,125
Are you mad?

1317
01:49:34,208 --> 01:49:36,291
I rejected 1,000 models 
before selecting you.

1318
01:49:36,375 --> 01:49:38,000
I finalized the contract 
by showing your photo.

1319
01:49:38,083 --> 01:49:39,000
And that idiot liked you.

1320
01:49:39,291 --> 01:49:40,791
After this I'll be an 
international ad film maker..

1321
01:49:40,875 --> 01:49:42,041
..and you'll be an international model.

1322
01:49:42,416 --> 01:49:44,125
And I swear I have no time for this.

1323
01:49:44,666 --> 01:49:46,250
I'll give you as much 
remuneration as you want.

1324
01:49:46,333 --> 01:49:47,166
Please come.

1325
01:49:47,375 --> 01:49:52,541
Sorry, sir. I'm not doing it for money. 
It's.. It's my passion.

1326
01:49:53,333 --> 01:49:54,666
But I can't do nudity.

1327
01:49:54,833 --> 01:49:55,750
Why are you being such a pain?

1328
01:49:56,250 --> 01:49:57,666
Didn't you ever stand nude before a guy?

1329
01:49:58,083 --> 01:49:59,916
Are you doing it? 
Or else, I'll do it for you.

1330
01:50:00,166 --> 01:50:01,208
I didn't expect this.

1331
01:50:01,291 --> 01:50:02,000
What?

1332
01:50:02,083 --> 01:50:03,666
I'll call my friends right now.

1333
01:50:03,750 --> 01:50:05,458
Which friends?

1334
01:50:06,625 --> 01:50:09,458
Hey, no. No, no. No.  
Why did you remove it?

1335
01:50:11,583 --> 01:50:13,583
Just do as I say. Hey..

1336
01:50:13,958 --> 01:50:14,625
(Slaps)

1337
01:50:15,250 --> 01:50:15,916
(Gasps)

1338
01:50:17,333 --> 01:50:18,125
I'm sorry.

1339
01:50:18,208 --> 01:50:19,000
Did you hit me?

1340
01:50:20,041 --> 01:50:21,208
No.. I'm sorry. 
- What sorry?

1341
01:50:22,041 --> 01:50:22,708
(Slaps)

1342
01:50:23,416 --> 01:50:24,208
Puneet!

1343
01:50:24,916 --> 01:50:25,708
Who are you trying to call?

1344
01:50:25,791 --> 01:50:27,166
Puneet! 
- Who are you trying to call?

1345
01:50:27,250 --> 01:50:28,166
Your friends? 
- Adwith!

1346
01:50:28,250 --> 01:50:28,916
Adwith!

1347
01:50:29,250 --> 01:50:30,875
It's our Meghana's voice. 
- Puneet!

1348
01:50:30,958 --> 01:50:32,125
Yes, it's Meghana. 
- Help!

1349
01:50:32,208 --> 01:50:33,000
Come on!

1350
01:50:34,291 --> 01:50:34,916
(Slaps)

1351
01:50:35,333 --> 01:50:38,000
What did I ask for? Just one photograph!

1352
01:50:38,166 --> 01:50:38,750
(Slaps)

1353
01:50:40,041 --> 01:50:41,708
No! No! Puneet!

1354
01:50:41,791 --> 01:50:43,000
Why did you hit me? Why?

1355
01:50:43,083 --> 01:50:45,583
No! 
- Why did you hit me? How dare you!

1356
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:48,500
Puneet!

1357
01:50:48,583 --> 01:50:50,083
Hey!

1358
01:50:51,708 --> 01:50:53,208
Meghna!

1359
01:50:54,083 --> 01:50:55,875
Open the door! 
- No! No!

1360
01:50:56,583 --> 01:51:00,000
Call him. Call him. Come on.

1361
01:51:00,083 --> 01:51:00,791
Puneet!

1362
01:51:03,208 --> 01:51:09,750
Hey! Rahul! Stop it! 
- Rahul! Open the door!

1363
01:51:11,291 --> 01:51:12,916
Open the door!

1364
01:51:14,750 --> 01:51:17,375
Rahul! Open the door!

1365
01:51:17,458 --> 01:51:19,750
One photo is all that I have ever asked.

1366
01:51:19,958 --> 01:51:20,958
Meghna!

1367
01:51:22,125 --> 01:51:22,833
Idiots!

1368
01:51:23,875 --> 01:51:25,583
Such a waste of my time.

1369
01:51:27,083 --> 01:51:29,625
Open the door! Open the door!

1370
01:51:30,291 --> 01:51:32,875
Meghana! Meghana!

1371
01:51:39,250 --> 01:51:40,208
(Glass shatters)

1372
01:51:45,041 --> 01:51:51,458
Meghana.. Meghana.. 
- Meghana.. Meghana..

1373
01:51:51,541 --> 01:51:53,250
Meghana.. Meghana..

1374
01:51:53,333 --> 01:51:54,916
Open your eyes.

1375
01:51:55,500 --> 01:51:59,208
Meghana.. Meghana..

1376
01:51:59,916 --> 01:52:01,083
Meghana!

1377
01:52:02,250 --> 01:52:03,333
Meghana!

1378
01:52:04,083 --> 01:52:06,916
(Wailing)

1379
01:52:23,458 --> 01:52:26,833
You! 
How dare you kill Meghana!

1380
01:52:31,583 --> 01:52:33,875
I'll kill you right now!

1381
01:52:41,833 --> 01:52:45,125
(Coughs)

1382
01:52:51,208 --> 01:52:53,208
Thanks, man. You came at the right time.

1383
01:52:58,333 --> 01:52:59,708
That's the power of police.

1384
01:53:12,625 --> 01:53:13,541
Adwith..

1385
01:53:16,250 --> 01:53:18,250
(Camera clicks) 
- Don't harm our friend.

1386
01:53:24,166 --> 01:53:25,833
What are you doing? 
- (Camera clicks)

1387
01:53:25,916 --> 01:53:27,083
Photo-shoot.

1388
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:32,125
Actually I should shoot 
you with my revolver.

1389
01:53:33,083 --> 01:53:35,583
But I need someone 
to take the blame of..

1390
01:53:35,666 --> 01:53:37,041
..raping and murdering her.

1391
01:53:37,125 --> 01:53:40,375
So I made a video on his 
cell phone to upload it on..

1392
01:53:40,958 --> 01:53:44,333
..Facebook, Instagram,  
and what's the third one?

1393
01:53:44,666 --> 01:53:45,250
Twitter.

1394
01:53:45,333 --> 01:53:48,708
Yes, Twitter. 
I'm uploading it from his account.

1395
01:53:49,625 --> 01:53:51,833
Hey! No!

1396
01:53:54,166 --> 01:53:56,666
Got it. It's uploaded.

1397
01:53:57,125 --> 01:53:58,166
(Laughs)

1398
01:53:58,250 --> 01:54:02,291
We won't spare you. We won't spare you.

1399
01:54:06,750 --> 01:54:08,583
I won't spare you too.

1400
01:54:10,958 --> 01:54:15,708
Rahul, scar her face 
with that cigarette.

1401
01:54:16,208 --> 01:54:18,250
We've to make them 
look like sadistic psychos.

1402
01:54:18,833 --> 01:54:21,250
We should provoke 
the public against them.

1403
01:54:21,583 --> 01:54:26,083
No. Please don't harm our Meghana. 
Please, no.

1404
01:54:32,458 --> 01:54:35,125
Please, no.

1405
01:54:35,458 --> 01:54:36,541
Meghana

1406
01:54:37,541 --> 01:54:39,708
Please, no. 
- Please, no.

1407
01:54:39,791 --> 01:54:41,041
(Gasps)

1408
01:54:42,416 --> 01:54:45,083
(Gasps)

1409
01:54:45,416 --> 01:54:46,666
Meghana is alive.

1410
01:54:46,916 --> 01:54:48,500
(Gasps)

1411
01:54:48,791 --> 01:54:49,416
She's alive.

1412
01:54:50,583 --> 01:54:55,666
Meghana is alive, sir. 
Let's take her to the hospital.

1413
01:54:58,000 --> 01:54:59,666
Please help us to save her.

1414
01:54:59,875 --> 01:55:04,833
If you commit a crime, 
you should do it perfectly.

1415
01:55:08,166 --> 01:55:12,416
I'll complete what you left unfinished.

1416
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:16,750
No, sir. Please don't kill her.

1417
01:55:19,541 --> 01:55:23,833
Please, we beg of you. Don't kill her.

1418
01:55:26,583 --> 01:55:29,500
Meghana.. Meghana..

1419
01:55:33,291 --> 01:55:36,708
Meghana.. 
- Meghana..

1420
01:55:38,458 --> 01:55:39,833
Meghana..

1421
01:55:45,541 --> 01:55:47,500
We were convicted for a crime  
that we didn't commit.

1422
01:55:48,500 --> 01:55:52,208
We decided to kill Rahul 
and the ACP for what they did.

1423
01:55:53,833 --> 01:55:57,750
We escaped from prison 
and came directly to your house.

1424
01:55:58,166 --> 01:56:00,041
Vidya, open the door!

1425
01:56:30,083 --> 01:56:31,083
What are you doing here?

1426
01:56:31,166 --> 01:56:33,625
We escaped from prison to kill you.

1427
01:56:38,541 --> 01:56:39,333
Hey..

1428
01:58:35,375 --> 01:58:39,125
Die! Die, you rascal! Die!

1429
01:59:09,875 --> 01:59:12,166
'So the man who jumped 
over the gate in the night..'

1430
01:59:12,791 --> 01:59:15,666
'..wasn't Ganesh or manager 
like I thought. It was you.'

1431
01:59:16,583 --> 01:59:19,333
Correct. We jumped over 
the gate and tried to escape..

1432
01:59:19,500 --> 01:59:21,791
(Police siren wails) 
- ..but the police were onto us.

1433
01:59:22,625 --> 01:59:26,041
So we ran back to your 
house to hide ourselves.

1434
01:59:37,500 --> 01:59:42,666
We were shocked to see 
that Rahul's body wasn't there.

1435
01:59:43,833 --> 01:59:45,666
Then you saw us.

1436
01:59:46,375 --> 01:59:48,958
We were even more shocked 
when you said that..

1437
01:59:49,041 --> 01:59:51,041
..you killed Rahul 
whereas we had killed him.

1438
01:59:52,833 --> 01:59:56,000
We felt sorry for you 
when we heard your story.

1439
01:59:57,083 --> 02:00:00,958
It reminded us of Meghana. 
We felt pity for you.

1440
02:00:02,750 --> 02:00:05,333
We were imprisoned for 
a crime we didn't commit.

1441
02:00:06,208 --> 02:00:09,708
We didn't want you to go 
to jail for the crime that we did.

1442
02:00:09,791 --> 02:00:13,083
So we helped you 
to dispose Rahul's body.

1443
02:00:14,583 --> 02:00:18,125
Now tell us. Shouldn't we kill the ACP  
like we killed Rahul?

1444
02:00:18,875 --> 02:00:19,583
Kill him.

1445
02:00:19,666 --> 02:00:20,416
(Gunshot)

1446
02:00:20,500 --> 02:00:21,916
(Groans)

1447
02:00:26,083 --> 02:00:27,166
(Gunshot)

1448
02:00:37,500 --> 02:00:39,791
(Groans)

1449
02:00:40,958 --> 02:00:43,125
You idiots!

1450
02:00:43,833 --> 02:00:47,375
Why are you hiding? Come out!

1451
02:00:47,583 --> 02:00:53,166
You can't kill me but you'll 
definitely die in my hands.

1452
02:00:53,583 --> 02:00:57,416
Rahul died as soon 
as you got out of prison.

1453
02:00:57,666 --> 02:01:01,208
I immediately knew 
that you were behind it.

1454
02:01:03,750 --> 02:01:06,666
I knew I was your next target.

1455
02:01:06,750 --> 02:01:10,291
That's why I took precautions.

1456
02:01:11,166 --> 02:01:17,041
I won't spare your lives today. 
I'll kill her too.

1457
02:01:17,708 --> 02:01:20,458
First Meghana and now Vidya.

1458
02:01:26,500 --> 02:01:27,583
Oh God!

1459
02:02:19,791 --> 02:02:21,666
(Glass shatters)

1460
02:02:34,500 --> 02:02:36,208
Hey, no! Hey!

1461
02:02:36,291 --> 02:02:37,083
(Empty gun clicks)

1462
02:02:38,916 --> 02:02:39,791
(Gun Cocking)

1463
02:02:40,166 --> 02:02:41,250
(Gunshot)

1464
02:02:42,208 --> 02:02:43,166
Hey!

1465
02:02:44,458 --> 02:02:45,250
(Gunshot)

1466
02:02:46,166 --> 02:02:47,625
(Brakes squeal)

1467
02:04:54,041 --> 02:04:55,250
Mr. Das. 
- Yes, ma'am.

1468
02:04:55,958 --> 02:04:58,041
Here's 2.5 million rupees  
for her surgery.

1469
02:04:58,125 --> 02:04:59,750
Get it done right away.

1470
02:05:00,708 --> 02:05:03,291
When Rahul sir and Ganesh 
were fighting that day..

1471
02:05:04,625 --> 02:05:07,625
..I sneaked into your locker room 
to steal..

1472
02:05:07,708 --> 02:05:10,750
..2.5 million rupees 
for my little girl's surgery.

1473
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:17,541
I tried to open the locker, 
but I couldn't, so I stayed there.

1474
02:05:18,541 --> 02:05:23,791
After a while I heard screams 
and came to the living room.

1475
02:05:24,500 --> 02:05:27,416
I saw those three men killing him.

1476
02:05:30,083 --> 02:05:31,833
I didn't know what to do.

1477
02:05:32,458 --> 02:05:34,750
When I came out again after some time..

1478
02:05:35,166 --> 02:05:37,541
..you were kneeling beside 
Rahul sir's dead body.

1479
02:05:38,416 --> 02:05:40,583
When you were telling 
your past to them..

1480
02:05:40,958 --> 02:05:43,750
..in an effort to escape from there..

1481
02:05:44,125 --> 02:05:46,833
..I opened the tap in order  
to divert your attention.

1482
02:05:49,708 --> 02:05:51,791
But one of the three stayed 
back in the living room..

1483
02:05:52,166 --> 02:05:53,916
..so I couldn't get out of the house.

1484
02:05:54,666 --> 02:05:57,541
In my second attempt to run, 
I put the curtains on fire.

1485
02:05:58,666 --> 02:06:00,583
I was very scared that 
if I get involved in this case..

1486
02:06:00,666 --> 02:06:02,375
..my little girl will be left alone.

1487
02:06:02,458 --> 02:06:05,375
So I decided to leave 
the city with my family.

1488
02:06:05,708 --> 02:06:08,333
I left without thinking 
about you that day.

1489
02:06:10,041 --> 02:06:12,208
But you thought about 
my daughter's life..

1490
02:06:12,250 --> 02:06:14,416
..and gave me the money.

1491
02:06:16,291 --> 02:06:17,458
Please forgive me.

1492
02:06:23,041 --> 02:06:29,041
Vidya is here! 
Vidya is here! Come on, everyone!

1493
02:06:31,458 --> 02:06:33,166
How are you, dear? 
- I'm doing okay.

1494
02:06:50,375 --> 02:06:51,041
Camera.

1495
02:07:47,250 --> 02:07:48,791
You are not an ordinary woman.

1496
02:07:50,125 --> 02:07:51,541
You are a brilliant actress.

1497
02:07:51,875 --> 02:07:53,666
A brilliant actress.

1498
02:08:03,416 --> 02:08:04,625
Am I crazy?

1499
02:08:08,666 --> 02:08:10,250
I didn't kill my husband, sir.

1500
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:26,958
Action!

1501
02:11:03,416 --> 02:11:04,458
Cut!

1502
02:11:23,708 --> 02:11:24,958
I'll kill you!
