00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,690
One more non reliable lndian.

151
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,160

You know, something, Mads.

161

169
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:20,400
Look at these lives, rocking lives..

Good night, boring.

173
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,020
Did you see Madhavi?
- She hasn't joined six months ago.

174
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:40,250
And she is arguing with the editor.

175
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,750
Forget it, buddy.

176
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:46,750
Who is this painter?
Who knows this man?

177
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,760
And you spent five hundred
words for him.

178
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:52,290
Because he has spent his
whole life painting. Sir,

179
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:55,100
l know these painters.

180
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:57,230
They will make a circle,
and put a dot in it.

181
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:59,300
They will say that it
is a woman's face.

182
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,930
Sir, that's because
zero symbolises life.

183
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,770
His life!

184
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,940
lf it was me, l would have used
not more than 250 words.

185
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,250
l would have printed his photo too.

186
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,190
lf there was some minister or
film star in his exhibition.

187
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:17,280
See, Madhavi.

188

Write about the rich and
famous lifestyle..

189
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:23,320
..for our readers. Not about
some loser painter.

190
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,800
Whose achievements are zero.

191
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:27,330
Then, what are the achievements
of NRl Hiren Sanghvi?

192
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,800

Okay, sir.

208
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,340

Don't go by any gossip papers.

211
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:22,850
l don't have an affair
with any actor. Okay?

212
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,860
You are the only one in my life.

213

Baby, trust me. That's the way..

350
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,750
..they are supposed to be treated.

351
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:01,580
Otherwise, he'll run away
with some slimy bitch.

352
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,260
Zulfi. l have heard that you are..

353
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:13,270
..designing a lot for
the MPs in Delhi.

354
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:16,430
l really made lovely outfits
for the party meeting.

355
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,270
And they all loved it.

356
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,270
Why don't you do a favour to me?

357
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,600
What?

358
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,270
Why don't you design
something for me too?

359
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:26,670
l want to go to my in-laws
at the Ganpati.

360
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:28,280
But something very exclusive.

361
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:34,620
Hi.. We haven't met. - Hi.

362
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:36,280
l am Tarun Sanyal.

363
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,880
Yes, l saw you on
the ramp right now.

364
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,450
Madhavi Sharma. - l know.

365
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:41,690
The journalist from Nation Today.
- You know?

366
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,900
So, how did you like the show?

367
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,300
Very good. Fabulous actually.

368
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:46,800
Hello.. Madhavji - ln fact..

369
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:49,300
How are you?
- Hello.

370
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:51,840
When will the photos this
party be printed?

371
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:53,310
ln a couple of days.
- Hi.

372
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:54,700
You see..

373
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,710
lf you write about me a bit,
in bold letters..

374
00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:00,300
..if you print a couple
of pictures of me too.

375
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,650
..my friends and families
in the US..

376
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,710
..will be very happy to
see me as a celebrity.

377
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,310
You know what l mean?
- Yes.

378
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,320
So, when will you write about me?

379
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:11,320
l will tell you as soon
as it is printed.

380
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:13,980
Thank you, Miss Madhavi.

381
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:16,590
This is my card.
- Yes, l have it.

382
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:19,990
Keep it, please. Thank you so much.

383
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:22,500
Why don't you keep one too?
- Me too?

384
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:25,870
Yes. Nice show. Good work.

385
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:27,670
Keep it work.
- Thank you.

386
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:30,510
Thank you so much.
- Good work. All the best. - Bye.

387
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:34,340
So irritating.

388
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,340
You will get all kinds
of characters here.

389
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:39,350
Some people embrace as if..

390
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,350
..they are separated siblings.

391
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:42,850
So what if they don't even know..

392
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,360
..each others names?
- l know.

393
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,350
And some people meet
the celebrities..

394
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:49,690
..right at the time when their
photos are being clicked.

395
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,690
With them, their photos
are clicked too.

396
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,890
And yes, the most important.

397
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,370
Whether anyone likes them or not..

398
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,370
..every one is good friends
with the media.

399
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:02,030
Means? - Nothing about
you. Generally.

400
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,570
Yeah, right.

401
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:06,370
Anyway. lt was nice
meeting you, Tarun.

402
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:08,580
l will see you around.
- Yeah, sure.

403
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:10,380
Bye, bye.
- Bye,

404
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:15,980
There are so many people who..
my security agency..

405
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:18,390
Oh, that's cool.
- Oh.. what is this, vegetarian?

406
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,050
Yes, sir - Why have you brought
these grass and things?

407
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:23,390
Listen.. keep this money and bring..

408
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:27,400
..some hot and spicy chicken
and fish steaks.

409
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:30,400
Okay? Give some nice service here.
- Yes, sir. - Keep it up.

410
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,870
When should l come?

411
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,740
Why don't you do something
for her in Delhi?

412
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:36,740
Snehal, when are you
coming to Delhi?

413
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:41,580
All this phones and
all are a setting.

414
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,410
Suppose that l am driving the car..

415
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,580
..and there is a call for the
employer in the back seat.

416
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,420
And he says.. Hello.. yeah..
yeah.. yeah..

417
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:51,750
Yeah.. ..yeah, l am coming in
the night. Love you, bye.

418
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,760
lt is confirmed that it
is the wife's call.

419
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:55,920
He is correct!

420
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,830
Now, suppose there is something
about transaction.

421
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:00,770
What does a transaction mean?
- Business matters. - Okay.

422
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:03,430
Means.. hawala.. lakhs and crores..

423
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,830
Understand.
- Yes.

424
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:06,430
Yes, if he talks more to him..

425
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:07,940
..l mean.. a long conversation..

426
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,440
..means.. Yeah.. baby.. yeah..
baby.. yeah.. baby..

427
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:13,950
..yeah.. l love you, baby.. yeah..

428
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:16,610
Understand.. There
is something amiss.

429
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,780
The overtime is confirmed today.

430
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:20,610
Wow! Perfect!

431
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:23,450
They think that we
don't know English.

432
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:25,520
These people are crazy,

433
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:27,990
So what if Bosco is
a sixth grade fail?

434
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,860
Bosco knows English, understood?

435
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,870
lt is nothing. My
boss is so foolish.

436
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:37,130
ls it? Why? - Nothing.
Before going inside a party..

437
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:39,470
..he takes fifty rounds around..

438
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,470
..the hotel and calls up and asks..

439
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:43,740
..who has arrived? Who has arrived?

440
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:45,540
Why does he do like this?
- Nothing.

441
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:48,750
He thinks that he will be as
pricey as he arrives late.

442
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,080
Forget that.

443
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:51,480
My previous employer, Mr. Kishen.

444
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:53,020
He was something different.

445
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:55,560
He used to keep five pairs
of clothes in the car.

446
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:56,880
He used to move around in the car.

447
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,080
He would attend all the parties.

448
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,490
He would change the
clothes in the car.

449
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,490
And he didn't give me
any over time too.

450
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,500
All this are the big matters
of the big people.

451
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,500
ln a nutshell.. The one
who is successful..

452
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:09,000
..he has a candle by his butt.
- He is correct.

453
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:11,040
What are you talking about, Pramod?

454
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:13,510
The Saxena fluctuates
every other day.

455
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:16,170
Thousands and crores of capital..

456
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:17,770
..is being eroded just
being stagnant.

457
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:19,680
l think we should have patience.

458
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:20,970
Patience..

459
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:23,520
See, it takes time to take the..

460
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:26,850
..advantage of each
and every policy.

461
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,510
But till then all small and middle..

462
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:31,020
..scale industries
will be wiped out.

463
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:33,060
Thanks to MPs like you, Mr. Tyagi.

464
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:35,930
See, l am just the member
of the parliament.

465
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:39,530
Personally.. l don't
make any policy.

466
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:46,540
We will leave in some time.
- Hi!

467
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:49,540
Oh, hi! Gayatri. How are you?

468
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:53,070
l am okay. How are you? - Okay.
- Who are you with?

469
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:55,550
My secretary brought me here.

470
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,940
Okay, did you get a place to stay?

471
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:00,550
No. l am looking for work
and a place to stay.

472
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,080
Do one thing.. why don't you..

473
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,560
..give me a call next
week or something?

474
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,090
Yes?
- Yes.

475
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,720
Okay.
- Okay? - Thanks.

476
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:10,560
Bye.
- Take care.

477
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:14,760
Friend, make me an EP in some film.

478
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,560
She is a page three journalist.

479
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:22,970
Hi..
- Hi..

480
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,050
How are you?
- l am fine..

481
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,740
How are you, Sheetal?
- l am fine.

482
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:33,110
Kedar, tell me. Why
do they air kiss?

483
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:35,590
To know the breed of everyone.

484
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,980
What are you saying?
- Yes.

485
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,250
Okay, don't forget the 21 st okay?

486
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:39,660
My 'Karva Chauth' party?

487
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,750
You are coming there, isn't it? -
Of course. We will love to be there.

488
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:46,660
Thank you.
- Bye.. Bye.. - Bye..

489
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:50,260
Oh my god, what is she wearing?

490
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:52,600
Oh god! So middle class.

491
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:54,600
She has got money, but not style.

492
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,270
'Karva Chauth' party?
Can you believe that?

493
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:01,270
Whatever party l go to, they
are there in every party.

494
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,780
Goa is great. The beaches
are beautiful.

495
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:07,220
The food is great, the best
sea food you ever had.

496
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,610
Take great care of them, okay?

497
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:12,620
They are my special guests.
- Okay sir.

498
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:13,790
lt was so beautiful.

499
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:16,130
l have been there so many times..
- Really, you have been there?

500
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:18,790
Rhea.. What are you doing?

501
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:20,800
Are you crazy? Put that
away right now.

502
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:22,630
l think she is totally smashed.

503
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,630
Mom. Just take a chill pill.

504
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,810
Don't worry, aunty. l
will take care of her.

505
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:33,640
Control her, Anjali.

506
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,640
Right, anyway, back to
my Vaishnodevi trip..

507
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,650
..you know, before l went to Paris..

508
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,650
..it was lots of fun,
lots of friends..

509
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,650
..and l was just screaming..
Hail to the Goddess!

510
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:43,120
Who she? Do you know?

511
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,990
Even Anjali is a social
worker like Mrs. Bhavi?

512
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:49,150
What else will she do
if not social work?

513
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:53,070
The husband neglects her, and
the daughter doesn't listen.

514
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:55,670
Poor thing.
- Why didn't you remarry?

515
00:24:58,170 --> 00:24:59,260
See..

516
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:01,870
l have married twice and divorced.

517
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,200
l have money and independence.

518
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,080
My son has grown up, why
do l need a husband?

519
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:15,350
Excuse me. Hello? Yes..
where are you?

520
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:23,220
How are you? - l noticed you
in yesterday's party too.

521
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,690
Yes, even l noticed you.

522
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:28,200
Oh! This is so beautiful.

523
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:40,240
Hi..
- Hi..

524
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,720
Can l drop you somewhere?

525
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,710
Are you sure, l have friends..

526
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:49,110
The car is small, but
all you can come in.

527
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:51,180
Shall we go?

528
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:53,320
Come on in.
- Okay, thank you.

529
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,730
Good morning.
- Morning.

530
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:06,070
Thank god, it's Sunday.

531
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,900
A journalist has no
Sunday in their life.

532
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,740
Pearl.. what's your problem?

533
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:14,750
l have lots of problems. Look at me.

534
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:16,740
l am 27 years old.

535
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,820
Slim, sexy and intelligent,
but single. Look at me.

536
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,290
l have had three and
a half affairs..

537
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,750
..and l have been heartbroken
three times.

538
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,220
Three and a half affairs?

539
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:26,090
l didn't quite understand
this funda.

540
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,750
Three reached the bed room.

541
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:29,760
The fourth ended in the hall itself.

542
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:32,030
Pearl.. You won't change.

543
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,930
Mad.. Mad.. you are my last hope.

544
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:35,230
Hey, what can l do?

545
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,770
What do you mean, what can you do?

546
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,300
You go to such fancy
parties everyday.

547
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:39,770
You meet the rich and famous.

548
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,310
You cannot search one
millionaire for me?

549
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:44,440
Don't you get rich and famous
people in your flights?

550
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:46,300
l have kept that option open too.

551
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:49,170
But l am sick of these flights.

552
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:51,310
Sir.. can l get you
some tea or coffee?

553
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:53,110
Ma'am.. can l serve you?

554
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:56,120
Now. l just want.. some
servants of my own.

555
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:57,780
They should come to me and tell me..

556
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,290
..madam, how can l serve you?

557
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:01,120
What can l get you?

558
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:02,790
And l want one millionaire for that.

559
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,790
Will you help me?

560
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:09,060
l will try. You come to
the parties with me.

561
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:13,810
Hi..
- Hi, Madhavi, how are you?

562
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:16,340
l am fine, how are you? Good..
good. - Come inside.

563
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:18,140
Did you have any problems
in searching the building?

564
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:20,800
No.. the autos of Mumbai are smart.

565
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,350
He brought me to the right place.

566
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:24,410
Great. Come meet Pearl. Pearl,
this is Gayatri.

567
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,480
The one whom l told you about.

568
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:29,150
That girl in the train. She's
gonna share our place.

569
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,220
Hi..
- Hi.

570
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,830
Gayatri is from Delhi.

571
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,350
She has learnt acting
from some Mohit Sharma.

572
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:37,230
And Kathak from Pt. Sunder Maharaj.
- Why?

573
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:40,030
Obviously, Pearl. Because she
wants to become an actress.

574
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:43,170
Why do you need to learn
kathak to work in films?

575
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,830
Fill the form for Miss
lndia, miss world..

576
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:46,430
Straight ticket to bollywood, babe.

577
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:47,840
Pearl.. please..

578
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,000
Whatever.. l am going for a shower.

579
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:55,240
Don't mind. She talks a lot,
but she is good at heart.

580
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:56,840
Come in. l will show you your room.

581
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:00,850
Did you see that, Raghu? Nobody
is asking for more tea today.

582
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:02,860
Why?
- The owner of the paper has come.

583
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:05,390
Everyone has sniffed
a snake. Understood.

584
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:09,020
Sir has come.
- l understand.

585
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:14,870
Good day, everybody.

586
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,870
Please sit down and keep working.

587
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,340
Madhavi, any idea why he came?

588
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,880
What do l know?

589
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:27,880
Guys, l have news for you.

590
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:31,040
We did good.
- That's great.

591
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,880
The popularity of the page
three increased such..

592
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,890
..that they are increasing
the number of pages.

593
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:36,280
How many pages, sir?
- Easy.. easy..

594
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:39,220
We need more spicy stories and
more celebrity interviews.

595
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:41,890
There aren't that many celebrities
in the society, sir.

596
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,390
Create them.

597
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,060
Create them, and then destroy them.

598
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:48,900
lf you make the whole
paper a page 3..

599
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:51,900
..then what about our social
responsibilities? - True.

600
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,300
l don't make management decisions.

601
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:54,900
l just work here.

602
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:57,070
Okay, another piece of good news.
- What's that?

603
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:00,240
For these extra pages,
nobody gets paid extra.

604
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:02,910
That's not fair.
- l know..

605
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:04,250
And come what may..

606
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,910
l need three to four celebrity
interviews everyday.

607
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:07,920
Madhavi, are you listening?

608
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:09,920
Rohit, not like this.

609
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,920
lf you hold the gun like this,
it will seem real, not fake.

610
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:14,450
l had done an encounter in Panvel..

611
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:16,190
..with this shot and
from this distance.

612
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:19,530
lf you try the shot like this,
it will be okayed.

613
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,260
Okay.

614
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,090
What is your ACP doing
in the shooting?

615
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,400
What can l tell you?

616
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:27,940
He goes to the parties
in the night..

617
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:29,270
..and trains the heroes
during the day.

618
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,110
Why don't you write in
your papers about him?

619
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,940
Joe.. take the shot here.

620
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:35,270
Ready, Chintu?
- Order. Sir.

621
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:36,540
Clap!

622
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,480
26 by four.. take..
- Just a minute.

623
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:42,950
Mr. Rao, just a minute. Mr.
Vishnu, please come here.

624
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,490
See, the net is seen. Make up sir..

625
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,960
Yes sir..
- Give me the gum.

626
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:49,960
lt seems that the take is on.

627
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:52,360
See, all this. This is a profile.

628
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:53,960
Mr. Sharma.. that side.

629
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:55,430
Ready?
- Yes, sir.

630
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,130
Joe, ready?
- 26 by 2.. take 2.

631
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:02,230
Come on Salim..
- What are you doing, sir?

632
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:04,140
Come on.. - Sir.. - Take the hand
away.. take the hand away..

633
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:06,980
Cut it.. cut it..

634
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:08,310
Okay. Great shot.

635
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:12,650
Very good. Very good.
Brilliant. Very nice Rohit.

636
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,580
Mind blowing, Rohit, excellent.

637
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,520
lt really seemed realistic.
- Oh, hi, Madhavi. - Hi.

638
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:18,990
How are you doing?
- Good.

639
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:20,520
That's Madhavi from..

640
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:25,000
Of course l know her. Her
newspaper prints about me.

641
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:26,530
We have to print it.

642
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,160
You are in every party, isn't it?

643
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:31,530
Rohit, can we do the
interview please?

644
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:33,000
Madhavi, the interview
will be later.

645
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,170
First you tell me..
Were you able to make any..

646
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:38,010
..difference between
the real cop and me?

647
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,170
Yes.

648
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:41,010
You don't have to face
the real bullets.

649
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:43,010
Highlight the product.
- Right sir.. sir.. - Show me.

650
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:47,010
Take it from this angle.
- Right sir.. - Yes, that's it.

651
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,010
Hi..
- Hi, Madhavi.

652
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,020
How are you? Hi, Akash..

653
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,030
Give me five minutes.
l will be with you.

654
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:58,690
Yeah, sure, go ahead.
- Please have a sit.

655
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:03,030
Get the other boys please.
Yes, Madhavi.

656
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,030
Hi, Dennis.
- Hi.

657
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:09,030
Why did you choose a location
like Madh lsland?

658
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:10,510
You know, Madhavi..

659
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,200
This underwear ad..

660
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:15,040
lt's very low price underwear.

661
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,710
lt's for common people.
For the common people.

662
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:21,650
And the slogan is.. The pride
of the common people.

663
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:25,060
Common people underwear.

664
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:27,220
Excuse me, my shot is ready.

665
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:36,060
What are you doing here?
- Come on, let's be ready.

666
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,070
Akash.. let's take..

667
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,070
Boys.. more energy.. more energy..

668
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,070
Come on..

669
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:48,080
Yeah, that's it..

670
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:52,070
That's the spirit. That's it.

671
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,420
Okay, tell me.

672
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,090
Why were you doing an underwear ad?

673
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,490
You know.. Every game has its rules.

674
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:14,110
And l am not the son
of some rich father.

675
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:16,110
l have to do something to survive.

676
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:19,100
But you see.. l will make it.

677
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:23,270
What about you?
- My parents stay in Bangalore.

678
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,120
My dad is an ex army officer.

679
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:28,110
Army..

680
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,110
Yeah..

681
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:33,120
Can l ask you something?

682
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:36,320
Do you believe in love
at first sight?

683
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,130
Then we should meet more.

684
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:46,130
Yeah..

685
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,140
Just a minute.

686
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,140
Daddy..

687
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:54,650
Sweetie.. - Bye daddy.

688
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:56,150
You have fun in Goa.

689
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,750
And if you have any problem,
give me a call.

690
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:00,150
Of course, daddy.
- Bye.

691
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:02,150
Bye, mom.
- Bye, darling.

692
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,180
Let's go. - Bye - Bye. - Bye.

693
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,160
You have given a lot
of freedom to Rhea.

694
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,490
She comes home late in the night.

00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:15,660
She stays at a friend's
house in the night.

696
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:18,660

like all this.

Come on, Anjali. What's
your problem?

698
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:23,200
She is young, let

Yeah.. l know but..

700
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:26,700
There has to be some limit..

Come on, Anjali, drop it, okay.

702
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:34,520
Okay. l have signed the cheque
for your Children's home.

He is looking at us. He is angry.

712
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:15,220
Yes, what can we do? We
get such items every where.

713
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,390
What is your problem?

714
00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:22,230
Do you have any problems?

Hey, don't let him go.

00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:36,510
Abhijeet.. let him go.. let him go!

720
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,250
lt is done.

721
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:45,420
ls it my fault that
nature has made me like this?

722
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:48,260
Can't l have a choice?

723
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:51,260
See, Abhijeet.. however
and whatever you are..

724
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:53,270

Thanks, Madhavi. l will leave now.

726
00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:01,470
Don't be silly. Where will
you so late in the night?

727
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:03,600
And you aren't well too.
Why don't you stay here?

728
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:06,680
No, Madhavi. lt won't seem good.

729
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:08,610
Your flatmates will have a problem.

730
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,620
My flat mates won't
have any problems.

731
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,280
They are very understanding, okay?

732

Such a boring flight, l was bored.

736
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,700
Hey, Mads.. Mads.. what's up?

737
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,900
Mads..

738
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:41,810
l didn't know you had
company last night..

739
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:44,480
Keep it up, lndia.. keep up.

740
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:46,920
Pearl.. that's Abhijeet. My friend.

741
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:48,650
Who is this Abhijeet?

742
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,660
You mean.. Abhijeet..

743
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,720
Yes, that's him.

744
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:59,330
You are so boring and so same..

So sweet. Make some
tea for me.. please..

746
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:06,500
You won't change.

747
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:10,500
Mr. Charu will meet tomorrow?

748
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:13,340
Okay, please give him the message.
Gayatri Sachdeva.

749
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:16,350
No..

750
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:18,750
Not Savitri, Gayatri.

751
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:22,350
G.. G for God.

752
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:25,360
Please..

753
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:29,520
What is the matter, Gayatri? You
didn't go to the dance class today?

754
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:34,530
No.. that film maker..
Charu Mohanty.

755
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:37,700
l am trying his
number since four days.

756
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,770
Every time they say, he is
in the bath or in a meeting.

757
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:42,700
l don't understand.

758
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,870
When do they make films?

759
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:46,540
You come with me.

760
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:48,710
Where?

761
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,980
This is Bombay. Nothing is
done without contacts here.

762
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:53,380
Please let us have this interview.

763
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:56,980
We have come all the way
from Kanpur once again.

764
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:59,550
We will have the interview.
Please don't worry.

765
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:02,390
Have the tea.. have it..
- Mr. Jhulka..

766
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:04,400
Oh, Miss Madhavi.. come on.

767
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:07,400
He is waiting for you.
- Thanks. Come.. come.

768
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,400
Mr. Jhulka.. - Yes, when
is the meeting scheduled?

769
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:17,570
Mr. Mishra. - Yes? - Did you
see the English newspaper?

770
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:20,740
Even though this Hindi
newspaper has double the circulation.

771
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:24,070
Anyways.. have the tea.

772
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:30,420
Mr. Rohit. l have seen
every of your movie.

773
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:32,420
l am a huge fan of yours.

774
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:34,020
Thanks.

775
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:36,430
Rohit, you have to do
something to help her.

776
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,760
Of course, Madhavi. Of course.

777
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:41,430
l have worked with Mr.
Charu actually.

778
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:44,600
Gayatri..
- Sorry.

779
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:47,940
Tell me. Why do you
want to start your career..

780
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:50,600
..from Mr. Charu's serious cinema?

781
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:54,510
Because l don't want to dance
around trees in the name of acting.

782
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:57,780
So you want to do
performance oriented rules?

783
00:37:57,850 --> 00:38:00,840
Good. We have something in common.

784
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,460
Mr. Jhulka!

785
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:14,960
Sir.. There is a new girl,
her name is Gayatri.

786
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:16,800
She has been recommended by
Rit Kumar. l have auditioned her.

787
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:19,860
She gives perfect expression.

788
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:22,070
And sir, she has a
great dialogue delivery.

789
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:24,470
Sir, she is perfect
for Santhalika in our next film..

790
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:25,880
..and she is promising too.

791
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:28,880
What should l do, sir?

792
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:34,820
Will she give?

793
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:41,990
Call her.

794
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:47,060
Sir, the article
has come from Delhi.

795
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:48,830
There are just some corrections in it.
Yes, l will email it tonight, sir.

796
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,670
Bye..

797
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:57,010
Gayatri, how was your
meeting with Charu Mohanty?

798
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:08,020
Where is she going?

799
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:09,850
No, Rohit. How did he do this?

800
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,690
Gayatri had gone with
your reference to meet him.

801
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:16,520
l know. Do you know what a
state she is in right now?

802
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,860
And this Charu Mohanty talks a lot..

803
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:21,870
..in his films about
female liberation and all that.

804
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,940
This is not done, please.
You have to do something.

805
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:29,530
Okay, fine. Okay.

806
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:32,700
Okay, bye.

807
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:38,550
Forget it, Gayatri. Please.

808
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:40,710
Rohit Kumar has
apologized personally.

809
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:43,050
He said that he will definitely..
- Forget your drama.

810
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:45,890
Didn't l tell you that she
should fill the Miss lndia form?

811
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,050
Pearl, please.. what are you saying?

812
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:51,890
Pearl please.. what? One has
to compromise in Bollywood.

813
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,560
Pearl. There are good and
bad people in every field.

814
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:57,300
lf she gets one bad person,
is the whole industry rotten?

815
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:00,110
lt depends on an individual,
whether..

816
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:02,160
..they want to compromise and
move ahead, or with hard work.

817
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,970
lt isn't about good or bad.

818
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:06,570
lt's business. Give and take.

819
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:08,580
l cannot believe that
you are being so cynical.

820
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:10,740
l am not being cynical.
l am being practical.

821
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:12,580
Don't be foolish. - Me.. - Can't
you be sensitive to our friend?

822
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:15,090
l am being foolish?
- Of course.

823
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:18,180
lnstead of consoling her, you should
be telling her to be strong, damn it.

824
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:24,100
Yes. l know. l know.
But the next time..

825
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,760
..we will cover your wife's
candle exhibition very well.

826
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,100
Absolutely. Someone from
the office will call you.

827
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:30,760
Right sir, thank you.
Thank you very much.

828
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:35,770
Yes, tell me, Nandu.

829
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:39,780
See, your crime reporter..
What is his name?

830
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:42,210
Vinayak Mane.

831
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:46,950
He is writing
anything about our MLA.

832
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:49,280
Call him back.

833
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,290
But he is in Nashik for a holiday.

834
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:55,290
That is the
election spot of our MLA.

835
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:59,130
Actually..

836
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,630
lf our workers get angry once..
then.. - Get up.

837
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,790
Who me?

838
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:05,630
Yes, get up.

839
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:11,640
We have printed just one
story of Vinayak Mane.

840
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:14,810
lf we print the whole story..

841
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,980
..your MLA will have to
leave the election area.

842
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,050
Did you have your tea?
- Yes.

843
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,990
Get lost.

844
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,830
Did you read
Vinayak Mane's MLA story?

845
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,660
Excellent. Has he gone to Nashik..

846
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:37,670
..on a holiday, or did he
go to search for a scoop?

847
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:40,000
Can he ever sit silently?
- Yes, that is correct too.

848
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:42,060
Hey, Kedar. Are you going
to Tejani's happening party?

849
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:44,340
The one in the town.

850
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:48,180
Yes. l am thinking
which hero to be. - Why?

851
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:51,840
The theme is very strange.
Bollywood night.

852
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:59,680
Bollywood.. Bollywood night..

853
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:04,090
They have different
styles and attitudes.

854
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:07,860
Even then.. the world
bows to their attitudes.

855
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:11,870
Very filmi.. very filmi..

856
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:16,030
Very filmi.. very filmi..

857
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:20,040
Very filmi.. very filmi..

858
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:24,710
Very filmi.. very filmi..

859
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:31,380
Very filmi.. very filmi..

860
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:36,050
See, Shah Rukh Khan
and Devdas have arrived.

861
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:40,220
See, she has come as Umrao Jaan.

862
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:48,060
Lagaan's Aamir Khan has arrived.

863
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:52,080
Madhuri has brought
life in the party.

864
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:56,080
Amitabh from Deewar..

865
00:42:56,150 --> 00:43:00,080
You don't know his magic!

866
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:03,250
what do you think about
this Bollywood theme party?

867
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:05,760
What can l tell you
about his parties?

868
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:08,920
Just like how the law
and order of our city..

869
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,090
..never fails Tejani's
parties too, never fail.

870
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:15,260
But what l cannot understand is,
what is Paro doing with Chunnilal.

871
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,430
That's our secret.

872
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,100
You didn't come to my party.
lt was a great party.

873
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,770
But you came to Tejani's party?
- l was in Delhi.

874
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,780
But l gave good coverage.

875
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:26,770
So the Charlie's Angels are here.

876
00:43:26,850 --> 00:43:29,780
Come on, Deepak. This is
supposed to be Bollywood party, okay?

877
00:43:29,850 --> 00:43:33,110
Call us the three goddesses,
Deepak. - Three Goddesses.

878
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:35,120
You are not seen in
the parties nowadays.

879
00:43:35,450 --> 00:43:38,120
Too much work.
- Not really.

880
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:39,950
The pages of your
newspapers have increased.

881
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:42,380
lf it is sold, it
will have to be printed.

882
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:44,790
Hi, Mrs. Bhavi..
- How are you, Madhavi?

883
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:46,800
You doing okay?
- Yeah, fine.

884
00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:50,300
Enough material for your coverage.

885
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:53,340
lt's good that none asked for
the invite, or we'd be caught.

886
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:55,970
Come on. We will
drink and dance, come on.

887
00:43:56,310 --> 00:43:59,470
What kind of people are they?
Filmi! Filmi! Filmi!

888
00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:01,980
He is saying filmi in the presence
of film people. Give me a match.

889
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:05,140
Do you smoke imported cigarettes?
- Then what?

890
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:07,410
lt is the brand of my past employer.

891
00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:10,220
lt is mine now.

892
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:12,820
Do you mean the diamond merchant,
Mr. Kothari? - He is gone now.

893
00:44:12,990 --> 00:44:15,980
He had a solid passion for gambling.

894
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:17,830
What is gambling?
- A girl.

895
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:19,830
lt's a code word.

896
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,830
He had a passion for girls.

897
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,160
He took girls on a cruise.

898
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:28,170
A cruise means?
- A cruise means a long ship.

899
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,330
The Titanic..

900
00:44:30,410 --> 00:44:34,000
He took a dozen girls on a
cruise to foreign countries.

901
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:36,340
A cruise, and then
another and then another.

902
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:38,250
He was ruined one day.
- Where is he now?

903
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:41,010
Santa Cruz.

904
00:44:41,450 --> 00:44:45,520
He has a ready made
clothes shop in Santa Cruz.

905
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:47,860
He is ruined.

906
00:44:47,930 --> 00:44:50,860
Therefore, never go in for gambling.

907
00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:53,190
Huge Titanics have been sunk.

908
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:56,030
Hi, Abhijeet darling..

909
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:58,370
Honey, how is my make up?

910
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,870
Too loud. Tell me.

911
00:45:01,210 --> 00:45:03,040
Attitude.

00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:07,880
Bollywood parties tonight.

913
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:11,880
They have different
styles and attitudes.

914
00:45:12,050 --> 00:45:15,890
They have different
styles and attitudes.

915
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:19,890
Even then, the world
bows to their attitude.

916
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:22,220
How are you?
- Hi.

917
00:45:22,290 --> 00:45:25,230
Okay. l have spoken to
Rakesh about your photo shoot.

918
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:28,060
You just contact him and
give him my reference.

00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:30,400
You are looking
very beautiful today.

920

Take care.
- Thanks.

921
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:34,900
What about Mehta brothers?

922
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:37,240
l have heard that there is
some dispute between them?

923
00:45:37,310 --> 00:45:38,900
We have heard the same thing too.

924
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:40,910
But l think that..
- Excuse me, darling..

925
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:43,070
Have you seen Rhea anywhere?

926
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:44,980
She must be around.

927
00:45:45,050 --> 00:45:48,080
They have different
styles and attitudes.

928
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:51,520
l think that the
party is warming up.

929
00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:53,080
lt will be five.

930
00:45:54,990 --> 00:45:57,090
Therefore, l am telling you
not to have more than five pegs.

931
00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:00,930
Pearl, this is Harsh Thakur,
a family friend.

Also, a very big
hotelier from LA and UK. - Hi.

Hi, Vijaya.
- Hi! - How are you?

937

Who is the new one with Harsh?

938

Pearl.. air hostess.

939
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:21,280
Another trolley to lolly.

What are you talking about?
- These drivers will be together.

950
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:53,310
But their sir and madam,
they come and go together.

They used to stay together.
Even l was ashamed.

00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:08,330
What are you saying? - lt is just
the Dubai Festival, during that.

957
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,160
They must have gone
for some shopping.

958
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,330
Not shopping.

959
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:15,170
There is less shopping
and more swapping there.

960
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,610
What is swapping?

961
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:18,510
Exchange..
- What are you talking about?

962
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:21,010

Nothing.. are you going?

My wife is waiting for me.

971
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:48,200
She hates all this.
How are you going home?

972
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:52,040
Tarun will drop me home.

973

What is special this time?

980
00:48:15,470 --> 00:48:18,060
Can any Hollywood party
be without an item number?

981
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,070
Oh my god!

982
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:22,570

My lover doesn't
give me any water..

988
00:49:02,350 --> 00:49:05,440
The husband's brother

989
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:09,110
The husband comes for one month.

990
00:49:09,190 --> 00:49:12,450
As soon as he leaves,
l lose my heart.

991

Truck driver's song.

Wherever l go,
everyone stares at me.

1002

A well means a well.

1012
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:47,550
A well? Very well.

1013
00:50:52,290 --> 00:50:55,730
Hey, let's go back to the party.

1014

00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:23,640
Shut up!

1039
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:26,380
Why are you clapping?

1040
00:52:26,450 --> 00:52:29,650
ls this a cricket ground?

1041
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:31,380
This is a society compound.
Go and play in the ground.

1042
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:34,650
Will your father pay
if the glass breaks?

1043
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:36,320
As it is, your father
doesn't pay maintenance.

1044
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,660
l am so sorry, uncle. l am so sorry.

1045
00:52:42,730 --> 00:52:45,670
What sorry? Did you get
my head to throw this?

1046
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:48,330
Sorry. - ls the matter
done if you say sorry?

1047
00:52:48,410 --> 00:52:51,340
There were two problems.
There is a third one too now.

1048
00:52:51,510 --> 00:52:54,000
l had told no to the secretary,
l had told no.

1049
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:56,670
Not to give flats to single girls.

1050
00:52:56,750 --> 00:52:59,340
Bakul Patel is gone today.
l won't spare him today.

1051
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:01,350
They come back at one
thirty in the night.

1052
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:04,510
This bloody idiot is dead.
- Let it go!

1053
00:53:04,590 --> 00:53:06,680
Such nice and respectable live here.

1054
00:53:08,530 --> 00:53:10,690
Hey, Bakul. What is your problem?
Why are you irritating her?

1055
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:12,530
Talk to me.

1056
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:14,690
l don't talk to women, go.

1057
00:53:14,770 --> 00:53:17,030
Yes, you don't talk to women,
but grope them.

1058
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:18,760
And that too, housemaids.
- Forget it.

1059
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:20,700
What should l forget? Hey, fatso..

1060
00:53:20,770 --> 00:53:23,370
You see a lone girl and flirt
with her. What is your problem?

1061
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:26,540
Should l come down?
- No.. No.. stay there. Stay there.

1062
00:53:26,610 --> 00:53:28,550
You flirt with girls
in the Nana Nani park..

1063
00:53:28,610 --> 00:53:30,710
You wait. lf l meet you,
should l come down?

1064
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:32,370
This is the limit.

1065
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:34,380
What are you smiling about?

1066
00:53:34,450 --> 00:53:36,720
ls there a drama going on here?

1067
00:53:36,890 --> 00:53:38,380
Go to the ground, go to the ground.

1068
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:40,450
Sir, please give this.

1069
00:53:40,530 --> 00:53:42,720
Yes.

1070
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,900
Looking at socialite's plastic
smiles in the party circuit..

1071
00:53:52,970 --> 00:53:57,070
..l thought where would
l get so see real smiles?

1072
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,570
l got the answer in these kids.

1073
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:03,580
ln their unconditional love.

1074
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:06,740
They don't see what is whose status.

1075
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:09,150
Who is happening and who is not.
You know what l mean?

1076
00:54:10,490 --> 00:54:14,590
So.. sorry. So this
is what motivated you?

1077
00:54:14,930 --> 00:54:17,590
Yes. And my husband.

1078
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,430
Ramesh has really supported me.

1079
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:23,430
He funds this children's funds too.

1080
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:24,940
Okay.
- Tell me something.

1081
00:54:25,170 --> 00:54:28,160
You were ex miss lndia, isn't it?

1082
00:54:29,510 --> 00:54:31,440
Forget it. There wasn't
any hype at that time.

1083
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:33,440
Yatin.. come here..

1084
00:54:34,510 --> 00:54:36,850
How are you?

1085
00:54:37,850 --> 00:54:39,610
l am all right.

1086
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:42,950
Does this play songs?
- Yes, it does.

1087
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:45,110
Good boy.

1088
00:54:46,530 --> 00:54:49,050
You know.. what is printed
in which parties you go to.

1089
00:54:49,130 --> 00:54:50,790
But nobody writes
about your good work.

1090
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:54,460
You write it.

1091
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,470
People will come to know about it.

1092
00:55:02,810 --> 00:55:06,470
Did you read about
Anjali Thapar in page 3?

1093
00:55:06,650 --> 00:55:08,880
Nothing much to talk about.

1094
00:55:09,650 --> 00:55:12,640
Hey, did you read the Anjali
Thapar piece in the Metro Today?

1095
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:16,880
Yes. lt speaks less about
social less and party animals more.

1096
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:20,490
Exactly.

1097
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:22,650
You are coming to
Jack's party tonight?

1098
00:55:26,670 --> 00:55:29,100
Sir.. did you see?

1099
00:55:29,170 --> 00:55:32,660
Anjali Thapar's interview
was cut, the meaning was lost.

1100
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:37,000
There was a ad in the last meeting.
l told Fauze to cut it.

1101
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:39,900
But sir.. l have
worked so hard on it, sir.

1102
00:55:51,590 --> 00:55:53,520
What the hell is this?

1103
00:55:53,590 --> 00:55:57,030
You cut Anjali Thapar's social
work details from the article.

1104
00:55:57,100 --> 00:55:58,860
Could you not cut anything else?

1105
00:55:58,930 --> 00:56:01,520
You just reduced it
to a social butterfly.

1106
00:56:01,930 --> 00:56:03,700
Did she pay you?

1107
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:07,870
This is the problem. All
you think about is money.

1108
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:09,870
l don't know what has
happened to journalism.

1109
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:14,740
Who told you that
you are a journalist?

1110
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,950
This is what you write in
the page 3 column isn't it?

1111
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:25,720
Who went in whose party,
with whom who went..

1112
00:56:25,890 --> 00:56:28,760
And with whom who came back..

1113
00:56:28,890 --> 00:56:32,230
Who wore, ate and drank what..

1114
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:35,730
And what one didn't wear.

1115
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:40,570
Miss Madhavi Sharma.

1116
00:56:41,070 --> 00:56:43,560
This is called entertainment.

1117
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:48,580
Not journalism.

1118
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:54,590
Some people never change.

1119
00:56:54,650 --> 00:56:57,750
Out of them is this.
Our Vinayak Mane.

1120
00:57:19,950 --> 00:57:22,110
What is the matter?
Why did you call me?

1121
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:26,120
Sir, l have got a tip.
- What?

1122
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:27,280
Our drug dealer, Gomes..

1123
00:57:27,350 --> 00:57:28,880
..he is bringing drugs
at the Pali Hill bungalow.

1124
00:57:28,950 --> 00:57:31,290
When, today? Yes.

1125
00:57:31,690 --> 00:57:34,890
Tonight?
- Yes, sir. - Okay.

1126
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:36,950
Should l call Mr. Bhosle?

1127
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:40,130
Yes.
- Sure. - Sure, sir.

1128
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:15,170
Put on your red
shoes and dance blue..

1129
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:23,170
Dance to the song they
are playing in the radio.

1130
00:58:28,010 --> 00:58:31,180
The right side of your face..

1131
00:58:36,350 --> 00:58:40,260
Dance.. Dance.. sway to the
crowd.. to the empty space.

1132
00:58:43,030 --> 00:58:47,020
l took your heart
and then l said..

1133
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:51,030
l have these black tresses..

1134
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:55,040
l will keep dancing..

1135
00:58:55,110 --> 00:58:59,870
l will keep dancing..

1136
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:06,110
Put on your red
shoes and dance blue..

1137
00:59:08,050 --> 00:59:09,710
Dance.. Dance

1138
00:59:09,890 --> 00:59:14,050
Dance to the song they
are playing in the radio.

1139
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:19,060
l have these black tresses..

1140
00:59:19,130 --> 00:59:21,060
l will keep dancing..

1141
00:59:21,130 --> 00:59:22,900
l will keep dancing..

1142
00:59:22,970 --> 00:59:25,060
l will keep dancing..

1143
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:28,900
l will keep dancing..

1144
00:59:29,070 --> 00:59:34,070
Let's dance!

1145
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:42,310
Hey, take him in..

1146
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:44,470
Don't spare anyone.

1147
01:00:46,150 --> 01:00:48,810
Hey.. stop it.

1148
01:00:50,890 --> 01:00:52,320
Arrest everyone.

1149
01:00:52,390 --> 01:00:54,380
Stop this. Mhatre, look for Gomes.

1150
01:00:54,460 --> 01:00:56,320
He shouldn't escape.

1151
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:59,160
Hey, Gomes! You!

1152
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,230
Don't run! Sawant
take him from behind!

1153
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:08,000
Come on.. take him inside..
take him..

1154
01:01:08,910 --> 01:01:12,340
Take him..

1155
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:20,580
Come on, Michael Jackson,
Madonna, in the van.

1156
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:24,860
This bloody rural man
has spoiled our mood.

1157
01:01:33,930 --> 01:01:35,870
Excuse me.

1158
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:38,430
What did you say?

1159
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:41,430
Rural man?

1160
01:01:42,210 --> 01:01:44,040
What do you think?

1161
01:01:44,110 --> 01:01:46,040
We cops are vernaculars?

1162
01:01:46,110 --> 01:01:49,880
We don't speak English? We don't have
civic sense? We are uncivilized people?

1163
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:53,610
And for your kind information.

1164
01:01:53,690 --> 01:01:57,250
This vernacular rural man has done
his Masters in English literature.

1165
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:59,880
From Fergusson college,
Pune. The best one.

1166
01:02:01,060 --> 01:02:05,890
First. Try to be a
good cultured lndian.

1167
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:11,060
Then.. try to be western.

1168
01:02:13,970 --> 01:02:15,410
Okay?

1169
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:18,400
Get in the van. l
said move, move fast.

1170
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:27,410
Come on, let them go,
let them go inside.

1171
01:02:28,990 --> 01:02:31,320
Hey, what are you doing?
- Come on, hero. Come in.

1172
01:02:34,090 --> 01:02:36,580
Thanks, Vinayak.
- You are welcome.

1173
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,260
Come on, bye.
- Do you have a match?

1174
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:47,090
Smoke less.
- From tomorrow.

1175
01:02:49,610 --> 01:02:52,100
Hey, hero, no noise.

1176
01:02:52,180 --> 01:02:53,610
You can't do this.
Let me talk to my dad.

1177
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:55,940
Don't talk now, call later.
Go in the van now.

1178
01:02:56,010 --> 01:02:58,110
Hey, dude, cool it. Do
you know who my father is?

1179
01:02:58,180 --> 01:02:59,950
Why?

1180
01:03:01,220 --> 01:03:04,450
Do you not know who your father is?

1181
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:06,680
Do you have a lot of fathers?

1182
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:09,120
Forget your father, l
know your mother too.

1183
01:03:09,190 --> 01:03:11,690
You are Pushpa
Bhargav's son, isn't it?

1184
01:03:13,030 --> 01:03:15,120
What is she called in
high society? Pushy..

1185
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:16,960
lsn't it?

1186
01:03:18,140 --> 01:03:20,570
She was in room number 603,
Oberoi towers, yesterday night.

1187
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:24,170
She was a younger boy than you too.

1188
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:26,480
Yes.

1189
01:03:26,540 --> 01:03:29,710
Should l tell the horoscope,
or will you sit in the van?

1190
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:34,150
Cool dude, it happens.

1191
01:03:34,220 --> 01:03:36,150
Come on!

1192
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:43,990
You rascal.

1193
01:03:44,060 --> 01:03:46,390
l am searching you since a year.

1194
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:49,660
Why sir? Did l commit a murder?

1195
01:03:50,070 --> 01:03:52,400
l sell drugs.

1196
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:57,170
And l don't sell it in the
government or police line.

1197
01:03:59,180 --> 01:04:01,170
This is the
intoxication do the big people.

1198
01:04:01,250 --> 01:04:03,340
What is this called?

1199
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:07,070
Rich and famous.

1200
01:04:07,150 --> 01:04:12,350
And some of your people ask
it in some big parties too.

1201
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:19,530
Park the car on the side.

1202
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:21,690
We will speak about it right now.

1203
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:24,190
Why? What do you say?

1204
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:41,380
He was talking about compromise.

1205
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:45,560
Sir has taken a
new way of encounter.

1206
01:04:45,790 --> 01:04:48,450
He was making us run since a year.

1207
01:04:49,390 --> 01:04:51,230
He is dead.

1208
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:53,390
He is handcuffed. He
must be some criminal.

1209
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:55,230
He must be escaping from the police.

1210
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:57,560
lt seems that he is some gang man.

1211
01:04:57,640 --> 01:05:00,400
lt doesn't take time for
the public to come in.

1212
01:05:02,140 --> 01:05:05,080
Oh, Mr. Mane is here.
- The whole story will be printed.

1213
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:13,230

The party is going on fine.

1218
01:05:57,590 --> 01:05:58,920
A lot of people have come.

1219
01:05:58,990 --> 01:06:02,120
After having four glasses of wine
it is difficult to make out.

1220
01:06:02,190 --> 01:06:05,860
..who is the king and which
is the queen. Pack.

1221
01:06:10,930 --> 01:06:14,270
For four years we don't know
whether he is a king or a queen.

1222
01:06:15,810 --> 01:06:20,040
You know Anjali. l wanted to
apologise. That article..

Anjali, what are you saying?

1225
01:06:25,150 --> 01:06:27,810
Whatever was published..
What l mean to say is..

1226
01:06:27,890 --> 01:06:31,080
You know sometimes, any publicity
is good publicity.

1227
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:34,060
You know after that two
of my kids were adopted.

1228
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:36,890
Really?
- Yes. - Good, l'm so glad.

1229
01:06:37,630 --> 01:06:38,960
What's up with you?

1230

You're so glowing and showing

1231
01:06:42,230 --> 01:06:44,060
No. Nothing.

1232
01:06:44,230 --> 01:06:47,230
l want to tell you about my
experience at Ladkh.

1233
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:48,770
lt was so horrible.

1234

Why? What happened?

1235
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:53,570
They gave me such a shabby room to
stay. - That's horrible, Zulfi?

1236
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:58,580
They didn't let me use the ladies
toilet. - My god! How did you manage?

1237
01:06:58,650 --> 01:07:02,590
The worst part is that they
did only two shots everyday.

1238
01:07:02,750 --> 01:07:06,590
Excuse me. l'm talking about
the film. You filthy mind.

1239
01:07:06,660 --> 01:07:08,750
You know that's why
l don't do films.

Mr. Rohit. People think Aids
patients as untouchable.

They are scared and terrified
of meeting them.

You are such a big
star in Bollywood.

1318

Still you have come to meet them
here. Are you not scared?

condoms from the chemist.

Which means that he was
killed in the gang war.

1372
01:18:12,590 --> 01:18:17,750
ln these places only you get
real stories. Not in parties.

1373
01:18:18,460 --> 01:18:25,260
Take care of your friend. lf
a need arises phone me. Bye.

1374
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:40,950
l'm fine. l don't know she is. Yes,
the doctor has admitted her.

1375
01:18:55,700 --> 01:18:57,290
Excuse me madam.

1376
01:18:58,370 --> 01:19:02,030
The patient is out of danger.
But we couldn't save the child.

1377
01:19:36,410 --> 01:19:39,930
Sir, a lot of phones are coming
from Gayatri madam. What should l do?

1378
01:19:40,510 --> 01:19:42,940
Did you not make arrangements
for Gayatri madam?

1379
01:19:43,010 --> 01:19:45,540
l had taken twenty thousand
rupees and went to her.

1380
01:19:45,620 --> 01:19:48,350
l ask her to get the abortion done.
She got angry with me.

1381
01:19:48,420 --> 01:19:50,410
She refused to talk.

1382
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:55,010
Sir, it's Madhavi calling
now. l'll cut it off.

1383
01:19:55,090 --> 01:20:02,860
O baby stop crying. - Madam
greetings. - Hi. - Hi. - Good morning.

1384
01:20:03,630 --> 01:20:04,760
Why are you crying?

1385
01:20:04,830 --> 01:20:09,770
l'm taking Mohit for a drive.
- Take the new car.

1386
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:11,640
Ok.
- Take care, - Bye.

1387
01:20:13,540 --> 01:20:15,030
Drive carefully.

1388
01:20:19,450 --> 01:20:24,390
Why are you ringing up that
bastard. Will he come with a bouquet?

1389
01:20:24,450 --> 01:20:28,390
Madhavi you know that he
is a public figure man.

1390
01:20:28,460 --> 01:20:30,890
Pearl please, Don't talk
like this at this moment.

1391
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:32,390
Then when do l talk?

1392
01:20:32,460 --> 01:20:35,120
The faster you come to your senses
the better it is for you.

1393
01:20:37,570 --> 01:20:38,800
Pearl why are you shouting?

1394
01:20:38,870 --> 01:20:44,810
l'm shouting because l care man.
l care for this stupid girl.

1395
01:20:49,480 --> 01:20:51,470
You'll be fine.

1396
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:11,590
What Rohit did to Gayathri broke
her confidence completely.

1397
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:15,830
She decided that she'll
leave the film line.

1398
01:21:16,710 --> 01:21:21,610
Pearl and me convinced her a lot.
But she went back to Delhi.

1399
01:21:23,950 --> 01:21:32,620
With informing the editor l published
an article in support of Gayatri.

1400
01:21:40,860 --> 01:21:43,060
There is a spicy article about your
boss published in the papers.

1401
01:21:43,130 --> 01:21:46,190
This is not about my boss. lt
must be about some other hero.

1402
01:21:46,540 --> 01:21:50,530
Do you know English. Will
you protect your boss?

1403
01:21:50,610 --> 01:21:52,540
Madhavi, you are also the limit.

1404
01:21:53,540 --> 01:21:57,480
First you wrote about your boyfriend
and l didn't tell you anything.

1405
01:21:57,550 --> 01:22:01,640
What evidence did you have that
Rohit Kumar did this to your friend?

1406
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:05,880
But sir l know.. - Do you have the
proof? No you don't have the proof.

1407
01:22:06,890 --> 01:22:09,480
When you write something you have
to back it up with proof.

1408
01:22:09,560 --> 01:22:11,650
That goes for all of you.

1409
01:22:11,730 --> 01:22:13,660
lt is fortunate that
you did put his name.

1410
01:22:13,730 --> 01:22:14,820
Otherwise he could've sued us..

1411
01:22:14,900 --> 01:22:16,490
..and l hope you know that.

1412
01:22:16,670 --> 01:22:18,500
The company is proposing
to organise..

1413
01:22:18,570 --> 01:22:20,000
..its publication awards
for the first time.

1414
01:22:20,070 --> 01:22:22,500
The secretary of Rohit Kumar is
saying that he'll be part of the show.

1415
01:22:23,910 --> 01:22:25,840
Do you realise what
all has happened?

1416
01:22:25,910 --> 01:22:27,670
Thanks to your personal
scores that ..

1417
01:22:27,740 --> 01:22:28,900
..you're trying to settle
through this paper.

1418
01:22:29,580 --> 01:22:31,570
Sorry you don't have that right.

1419
01:22:34,580 --> 01:22:36,520
The decision of the
management is that..

1420
01:22:36,590 --> 01:22:38,520
..you've to apologise
to Rohit Kumar.

1421
01:22:48,700 --> 01:22:56,870
OK then. Thanks to you. l have to
take responsibility for this disaster.

1422
01:22:57,610 --> 01:22:59,540
l guess. lf that's what you want.

1423
01:23:04,610 --> 01:23:06,610
You?

1424
01:23:11,620 --> 01:23:14,560
Cut it. Very good shot sir.
- Please come.

1425
01:23:14,620 --> 01:23:17,150
Thank god. l have to get
ready for the next shot.

1426
01:23:17,830 --> 01:23:21,160
Call of them. l need them
for the night shot.

1427
01:23:22,630 --> 01:23:25,760
Sir, Madhavi madam and Mr.
Suri have come to meet you.

1428
01:23:26,640 --> 01:23:29,300
You get them seated, l'll come.
- Ok sir.

1429
01:23:30,640 --> 01:23:32,570
Joe, l'm just coming.

1430
01:23:33,740 --> 01:23:36,080
Come on. Don't move. Come here.

1431
01:23:37,980 --> 01:23:42,580
Hello Mr. Suri. How are you?
- l'm fine. - Hi. Please sit down.

1432
01:23:43,990 --> 01:23:49,580
Hey give me a sponge. Will
you have anything? - No.

1433
01:23:49,660 --> 01:23:54,860
Will you have anything. How is
everything Mr. Suri. - Fine.

1434
01:23:56,870 --> 01:24:00,800
l heard that you'll not perform
in our award function.

1435
01:24:00,870 --> 01:24:04,930
Who told you that? Of course l'm
coming. These must be rumors.

1436
01:24:05,010 --> 01:24:08,940
For me a commitment is always
a commitment, come what may.

1437
01:24:10,680 --> 01:24:16,280
However l've been hurt
by what happened.

1438
01:24:16,690 --> 01:24:21,280
Especially because it
was done by a friend.

1439
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:24,020
You're absolutely right.
You're right. lt hurts.

1440
01:24:24,790 --> 01:24:27,630
You're right. Right Madhavi?

1441
01:24:34,900 --> 01:24:41,310
Rohit. l just wanted to say
sorry for this whole thing.

1442
01:24:41,710 --> 01:24:45,170
Hey Madhavi. Relax buddy. lt's Ok.

1443
01:24:45,250 --> 01:24:49,650
l know it happens. l've
no grudges at all.

1444
01:24:49,720 --> 01:24:52,050
We're friends, fine. How did
you ever think otherwise?

1445
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:54,180
They're friends! Friends.

1446
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:59,660
Mr. Suri, l tell you that your
show will be very successful.

1447
01:24:59,930 --> 01:25:01,660
Yes, l mean it.

1448
01:25:01,830 --> 01:25:04,660
l heard that you're going
to Guwahati for a shooting.

1449
01:25:04,730 --> 01:25:10,170
Yes, Mr. Suri. The shot demands
that l shoot there..

1450
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:14,340
The interesting part is
that the character..

1451
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:26,780
l understand. Star tensions.

1452
01:25:30,130 --> 01:25:32,120
Forget it Madhavi. These
things keep happening.

1453
01:25:34,130 --> 01:25:36,120
Professional hazards l should say.

1454
01:25:39,340 --> 01:25:42,570
Look there. - l'm sorry buddy.
- Look at that girl there.

1455
01:25:43,340 --> 01:25:46,670
You have started looking at girls?
- Yes, some of them.

1456
01:25:48,350 --> 01:25:55,340
lf this girl is so beautiful how
handsome her brother should be?

1457
01:25:55,420 --> 01:25:58,080
You are..
- l was just joking.

1458
01:25:59,160 --> 01:26:02,090
How is Gayathri? - l didn't
get any phone call from her.

1459
01:26:03,160 --> 01:26:05,490
How is Pearl? - She is getting
married and going to US.

1460
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:07,590
Lucky girl.
- Yes.

1461
01:26:11,170 --> 01:26:14,600
There comes Tarun. What
happened to his car?

1462
01:26:14,670 --> 01:26:18,510
Couldn't pay the installments. The
bank people took away his car.

1463
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:22,270
Vijay, you have a lot of contact
in the ad world, isn't it?

1464
01:26:22,350 --> 01:26:26,110
Why don't you use it to get Tarun
some big modelling assignment?

1465
01:26:26,180 --> 01:26:30,450
lf l use my contact
he will not like it.

1466
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:34,290
Actually it has been discussed in
three to four places. - Really?

1467
01:26:34,360 --> 01:26:36,520
Something will be worked out.
You don't worry. - Thanks.

1468
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:47,200
l'll reach the airport
in half an hour.

1469
01:26:53,210 --> 01:26:55,470
Madhavi take care of yourself.

1470
01:26:56,550 --> 01:26:58,140
Let's go Pearl.

1471
01:27:01,220 --> 01:27:03,210
Bye.
- Bye.

1472
01:27:12,230 --> 01:27:14,220
You're shifting to New
York after marriage.

1473
01:27:15,570 --> 01:27:17,500
l've been left alone.

1474
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:24,170
Listen, if that baldy bothers you,
give him slap on my behalf.

1475
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:27,670
Drink less wine, understood?

1476
01:27:28,580 --> 01:27:30,840
lf you are reminded of me
give me a phone call.

1477
01:27:30,910 --> 01:27:34,510
ls it? lnternational calls are
very expensive, understood?

1478
01:27:34,690 --> 01:27:38,450
That is why l asked you
to marry a millionaire.

1479
01:27:40,260 --> 01:27:42,190
Shut up. Ok.

1480
01:27:44,260 --> 01:27:46,250
You shut up.

1481
01:28:14,490 --> 01:28:16,480
Yes. When did this happen?

1482
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:21,550
Ok l'll pass the information.

1483
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:26,630
Sir, there is a breaking news.
Anjali Thappar committed suicide.

1484
01:28:31,510 --> 01:28:32,630
Show me that.

1485
01:28:32,710 --> 01:28:34,230
Hello. Hi.

1486
01:28:37,510 --> 01:28:38,570
What?

1487
01:28:38,650 --> 01:28:39,740
Madam Anjali is dead!

1488
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:44,750
Hemant call the fashion designer.

1489
01:28:44,820 --> 01:28:46,260
So you need something
for the funeral..

1490
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:47,920
..as well as the chautha
(fourth day after death).

1491
01:28:47,990 --> 01:28:49,580
l'll arrange for that. No problem.

1492
01:28:50,660 --> 01:28:52,930
When? Ok l'll be there.

1493
01:28:54,670 --> 01:28:56,530
Show me something in white.

1494
01:28:58,670 --> 01:29:03,000
lt must be because of depression.
Just a question of your life.

1495
01:29:19,620 --> 01:29:23,290
Honey where are you?
- l'm outside our bunglow.

1496
01:29:23,460 --> 01:29:25,950
Here everyone has come.
- Come on now stop it.

1497
01:29:26,030 --> 01:29:29,020
l'm in the midst of a three hundred
million deal. Don't disturb me.

1498
01:29:29,370 --> 01:29:32,630
The one who had to die has died.
lt's only a dead body there.

1499
01:29:32,700 --> 01:29:35,040
l know that. But you have to
do all these formalities.

1500
01:29:37,710 --> 01:29:39,300
Papa.

1501
01:29:41,480 --> 01:29:44,810
Do you think that Thappar
will marry again?

1502
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:46,820
Why? What are your intentions?

1503
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:52,320
Thappar is not a bad man.
But his daughter, my god!

1504
01:29:52,390 --> 01:29:54,720
What have you got to do with
the daughter? - Forget it.

1505
01:29:55,390 --> 01:29:59,330
Vijaya, l heard you're writing a
new book. What is the subject?

1506
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:01,730
So you're also interested
in reading books?

1507
01:30:02,670 --> 01:30:07,500
Anyway, what is there in your
books other than sex?

1508
01:30:07,570 --> 01:30:10,340
What else interests you?

1509
01:30:11,610 --> 01:30:13,340
That's a point.

1510
01:30:13,410 --> 01:30:15,610
Buddy, madam Anjali was
such a nice woman.

1511
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:18,010
She used to throw nice parties.
- Right.

1512
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:19,340
How much liquor we must have had..

1513
01:30:19,420 --> 01:30:20,680
..on the house out of Mr.
Thapar's money?

1514
01:30:20,750 --> 01:30:22,340
Will there be no more parties?

1515
01:30:22,420 --> 01:30:25,750
Don't get worried. lt will start
after the thirteenth day.

1516
01:30:25,820 --> 01:30:27,690
ls it? Let's go and mourn.
- Let's go.

1517
01:30:28,860 --> 01:30:33,690
Did you get any assignment?
- l'm trying.

1518
01:30:38,440 --> 01:30:40,630
Ok, l'll take leave.

1519
01:30:41,540 --> 01:30:46,440
Any idea where they will cremate
her. Shivaji park or Chandanwadi?

1520
01:30:46,510 --> 01:30:49,100
Chandanwadi since most of her
relatives are coming there.

1521
01:30:49,450 --> 01:30:51,880
l think it will be a
sandalwood cremation.

1522
01:30:51,950 --> 01:30:55,780
Definitely not Sneha. This is a jet
age. lt will be the electric.

1523
01:30:55,850 --> 01:30:58,580
Moreover it is environment
friendly, takes less time also,

1524
01:30:58,660 --> 01:30:59,710
l guess you're right.

1525
01:30:59,790 --> 01:31:01,380
She was a gem of a lady.

1526
01:31:01,460 --> 01:31:03,550
l have met her in lot of parties.

1527
01:31:03,790 --> 01:31:07,660
ln fact l have given a lot of
donation for her charities.

1528
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:11,390
Excuse me. What are you
doing? Let me talk.

1529
01:31:11,570 --> 01:31:16,800
Whatever happened is very bad.
God bless her soul.

1530
01:31:16,870 --> 01:31:19,400
Do you want me say something more.
- No, thank you sir.

1531
01:31:19,480 --> 01:31:20,570
Thank you.

1532
01:31:20,640 --> 01:31:21,800
Please. Please.

1533
01:31:21,880 --> 01:31:23,900
You must be seeing that the
crowd of celebrities..

1534
01:31:23,980 --> 01:31:26,420
..is increasing out side
the Thapar house.

1535
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:29,080
This is Archala Thripathi for FTV.

1536
01:31:29,150 --> 01:31:32,420
Tell me when they
will take the body?

1537
01:31:32,490 --> 01:31:34,480
l can't live without
the air conditioners.

1538
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:37,430
Sir, then how are you
doing your journeys..

1539
01:31:37,490 --> 01:31:39,430
..by foot and rallies in this heat?

1540
01:31:39,500 --> 01:31:45,770
Listen Joe. ln politics one has
to do all these dramatics.

1541
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:47,830
Then it is all a drama
that you play act?

1542
01:31:47,900 --> 01:31:49,600
Like your films Joe.

1543
01:31:49,670 --> 01:31:52,940
You get a chance and you start
defaming the film industry.

1544
01:31:53,510 --> 01:31:56,640
Then Samar, how is your security
business going on?

1545
01:31:56,710 --> 01:31:59,940
lt is running fine buddy. The last
elections l provided security..

1546
01:32:00,020 --> 01:32:01,640
..to so many people. But not a
single payment has been received.

1547
01:32:01,720 --> 01:32:04,120
Anjali Thapar's death
is a loss to humanity.

1548
01:32:05,960 --> 01:32:09,860
The children in her orphanage.
She loved them a lot.

1549
01:32:09,930 --> 01:32:12,190
She had a great affection for them.
She looked after them well.

1550
01:32:13,730 --> 01:32:17,060
Under what circumstances
she died, about that..

1551
01:32:17,130 --> 01:32:19,530
Arti madam, what would you say?

1552
01:32:19,640 --> 01:32:23,470
lt's all very sad. She
was a sweet lady.

1553
01:32:23,640 --> 01:32:27,870
She had come my films trial once
and she liked my work a lot.

1554
01:32:27,940 --> 01:32:31,940
ln fact she use to encourage me to
do a lot of good work, you know.

1555
01:32:32,020 --> 01:32:33,540
l can't take it that she is no more.

1556
01:32:33,620 --> 01:32:37,140
lt's not nice buddy.
- This is life buddy.

1557
01:32:37,220 --> 01:32:38,980
After a few days everything
is forgotten.

1558
01:32:39,060 --> 01:32:41,490
Then there is only the
photo that is hanged.

1559
01:32:41,660 --> 01:32:46,490
Maximum what will happen. Mr. Thapar
will get a road named after her.

1560
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:49,500
Anjali Thapar avenue. When people
like us dies one doesn't get..

1561
01:32:49,570 --> 01:32:51,760
..people who will carry the coffin.

1562
01:32:53,570 --> 01:32:55,560
Relax dear.

1563
01:33:02,680 --> 01:33:07,510
Anjali has left us forever.
lt's so shocking.

1564
01:33:07,850 --> 01:33:14,020
Let's not waste it. l've missed
our relationship a lot, Samir.

1565
01:33:15,930 --> 01:33:19,590
Don't know what l
am in search of.

1566
01:33:21,930 --> 01:33:30,270
Samir l was so good to you
and you were so good to me.

1567
01:33:32,610 --> 01:33:34,600
Samir please forgive me.

1568
01:33:36,610 --> 01:33:38,140
Joey are going to join the funeral?

1569
01:33:38,220 --> 01:33:39,880
l'll definitely be there.

1570
01:33:39,950 --> 01:33:42,540
l've seen a lot of Hindi
movies that worries me.

1571
01:33:42,620 --> 01:33:47,560
l'm yet to see a Hindu funeral. l'll
definitely go. - l'll go with you.

1572
01:33:47,620 --> 01:33:50,960
Mark my words. The who's who of
Mumbai are going to be there.

1573
01:33:51,060 --> 01:33:52,550
l heard that a lot of Bollywood
stars are going to be there.

1574
01:33:52,630 --> 01:33:53,890
Yes they will.

1575
01:33:54,630 --> 01:33:55,890
Are you leaving?

1576
01:33:55,970 --> 01:33:58,560
Yes, l have an ad film shooting
at the airport runaway.

1577
01:33:58,640 --> 01:34:01,970
We've got only two hours
permission. l'll have to go. - Fine.

1578
01:34:06,740 --> 01:34:09,580
They are disgusting. They
have started here also.

1579
01:34:12,650 --> 01:34:15,580
Buddy, why do they come to the
funeral with dark glasses on.

1580
01:34:15,750 --> 01:34:19,590
Half of them drink in the night.
Their eyes must be red.

1581
01:34:19,660 --> 01:34:22,090
To hide that they wear dark
glasses, understood.

1582
01:34:22,160 --> 01:34:23,590
Take the interview.

1583
01:34:23,660 --> 01:34:27,190
Madam Ritu, how are you feeling about
the sudden demise of Mrs. Thapar?

1584
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,590
l still can't believe
that she is dead.

1585
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,130
We were like sisters.

1586
01:34:34,870 --> 01:34:37,100
Unfortunately l was in Paris..

1587
01:34:38,780 --> 01:34:42,610
..for the promotion of my
new herbal cosmetic range.

1588
01:34:44,780 --> 01:34:48,620
lt is sad. l'm really
going to miss her.

1589
01:34:56,030 --> 01:34:57,620
Move away.

1590
01:34:57,690 --> 01:35:01,690
You think this is some fun
going on. Just stop it.

1591
01:35:01,770 --> 01:35:04,960
Can't you make out where to take
photographs and were not to?

1592
01:35:06,700 --> 01:35:11,370
John ask that journalist when this
interview will be telecast.

1593
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:16,140
By the way did you to Hemant's
party? - Yes, we did.

1594
01:35:17,810 --> 01:35:20,150
Was Sakshi there?
- After the party.

1595
01:35:23,720 --> 01:35:25,980
Madam, today night at eight.

1596
01:35:26,060 --> 01:35:27,650
l swear.

1597
01:35:31,730 --> 01:35:33,660
Who are you sending a message?

1598
01:35:34,730 --> 01:35:39,330
Every one should come to know that
Ritu Bajaj is back in Mumbai.

1599
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:43,340
Right. - And tonight she
will be in Ajtak TV.

1600
01:35:43,410 --> 01:35:46,670
l want to express my condolences
to the entire Thapar family.

1601
01:35:46,740 --> 01:35:47,870
Thank you.

1602
01:35:47,940 --> 01:35:50,170
Sir, one more question.
l want you to quote.

1603
01:35:50,250 --> 01:35:53,080
There are lot of Hindi films
on police these days.

1604
01:35:53,150 --> 01:35:55,010
What have you got to say about that?

1605
01:35:56,020 --> 01:35:58,890
Would you like this quote in Hindi
or English? ln Hindi please.

1606
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:01,690
How was your shooting in Andaman
sir? - Fantastic.

1607
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:04,280
We shot in scorching heat.

1608
01:36:08,770 --> 01:36:10,760
Are you coming with me?

1609
01:36:12,100 --> 01:36:15,700
lf both of us go together
it won't look nice.

1610
01:36:16,770 --> 01:36:21,110
You go now. l'll just join you.
See you later, bye.

1611
01:36:27,780 --> 01:36:30,910
Abhijit has told me about you.

1612
01:36:30,990 --> 01:36:32,920
The campaign that you've done.

1613
01:36:34,120 --> 01:36:35,720
Papa.

1614
01:36:35,890 --> 01:36:46,890
They meet for a couple of
moments and walk together.

1615
01:36:48,810 --> 01:37:00,810
They meet for a couple of
moments and walk together.

1616
01:37:02,150 --> 01:37:14,960
When the crossing comes
they escape away.

1617
01:37:16,930 --> 01:37:26,370
How strange relationships
exist here.

1618
01:37:28,040 --> 01:37:37,780
How strange relationships
exist here.

1619
01:37:40,860 --> 01:37:44,190
That's great. That's good.

1620
01:37:46,860 --> 01:37:48,850
So many people did
attend the funeral

1621
01:37:49,970 --> 01:37:54,060
Madhavi, five hundred words
by four o clock please.

1622
01:37:54,140 --> 01:37:56,130
l can't write it sir.

1623
01:37:57,210 --> 01:37:58,800
What?

1624
01:37:59,880 --> 01:38:01,070
What will l write?

1625
01:38:01,140 --> 01:38:03,810
That people were planning their
next party sitting there.

1626
01:38:03,880 --> 01:38:05,310
Messages were being sent.

1627
01:38:05,380 --> 01:38:09,220
They were discussing what diamond
set will match with white dress.

1628
01:38:09,290 --> 01:38:10,810
Shall l write all these?

1629
01:38:12,890 --> 01:38:19,420
Five hundred words. - l can't.
l'm so sick of it. l can't

1630
01:38:19,500 --> 01:38:21,490
Then what do you want to write?

1631
01:38:23,230 --> 01:38:25,830
There is something that..
- what?

1632
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,330
Something more meaningful.

1633
01:38:28,410 --> 01:38:30,840
More meaningful. That's wonderful.

1634
01:38:31,010 --> 01:38:32,840
Social issues, like Rape, dowry..

1635
01:38:32,910 --> 01:38:35,340
..and all that kind of things,
right? - Yes.

1636
01:38:37,010 --> 01:38:41,180
Do you have any experience. Do you
understand what you're talking?

1637
01:38:43,120 --> 01:38:45,110
l don't want to do page 3.

1638
01:38:50,260 --> 01:38:58,130
One stubborn woman. Anyway,
come in. Come.

1639
01:39:04,210 --> 01:39:10,870
Vinayak. Madhavi wants
to do crime also.

1640
01:39:12,280 --> 01:39:15,620
ls it? Then?

1641
01:39:16,950 --> 01:39:20,890
For some day you teach
her the routine.

1642
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:22,890
Sir, with me shell..

1643
01:39:23,060 --> 01:39:25,550
Vinayak she is serious.

1644
01:39:26,300 --> 01:39:28,890
She wants to do meaningful
journalism, right?

1645
01:39:28,970 --> 01:39:32,300
So it's decided that for fifteen
days you'll be with Vinayak.

1646
01:39:32,370 --> 01:39:33,960
ls that all right? Done.

1647
01:39:34,970 --> 01:39:39,240
Now Anjali Thapar, five hundred
words, four O clock, thank you.

1648
01:39:45,320 --> 01:39:47,410
Sir where are putting me with her?

1649
01:39:47,480 --> 01:39:50,920
ls she going to stick there?
She is a party person.

1650
01:39:50,990 --> 01:39:52,920
She'll return in four days.

1651
01:39:52,990 --> 01:39:55,580
Trust me. Trust me.

1652
01:39:59,030 --> 01:40:00,930
Challenge.

1653
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:08,460
Hello. l'm reaching there.

1654
01:40:09,340 --> 01:40:10,930
We're reaching there.

1655
01:40:18,110 --> 01:40:23,680
Working with Vinayak l learnt that
crime based journalism is no party.

1656
01:40:26,020 --> 01:40:29,480
ln search of stories Vinayak
used to work day and night.

1657
01:40:31,130 --> 01:40:35,690
Tarun did not like my idea
of working in this field.

1658
01:40:36,130 --> 01:40:38,120
But he did support me.

1659
01:40:41,140 --> 01:40:45,300
We used to reach any nook or corner
of Mumbai in search of a story.

1660
01:40:47,240 --> 01:40:50,510
l'm fine. - Hi Madhavi,
what a pleasant surprise?

1661
01:40:50,580 --> 01:40:53,140
Madhavi is working with
me on crime reporting.

1662
01:40:53,220 --> 01:40:55,480
That is why she is not seen
in parties these days.

1663
01:40:56,050 --> 01:40:59,390
Madhavi there are a few celebrities
who in spite of not having..

1664
01:40:59,460 --> 01:41:03,590
..photographers nearby come
to such places and work.

1665
01:41:03,660 --> 01:41:05,250
Pratima madam is one of them.

1666
01:41:05,330 --> 01:41:08,590
Come on Vinayak. Doesn't your
articles create awareness?

1667
01:41:08,670 --> 01:41:11,330
That is just like that.
Shall l do some work?

1668
01:41:13,070 --> 01:41:17,510
This is Munna. Our lnformer.

1669
01:41:18,170 --> 01:41:21,080
This person is working with me.
- Yes sir. - Recognise her.

1670
01:41:22,280 --> 01:41:26,010
Listen Gullu. Stop this trade
in children. Get reformed.

1671
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:29,070
Otherwise you'll be jailed for a
long period. Understood? - Yes sir.

1672
01:41:29,150 --> 01:41:31,090
Take him to the court.

1673
01:41:33,420 --> 01:41:36,190
Yes Vinayak.
- Yes boss.

1674
01:41:37,190 --> 01:41:39,220
You must be knowing her,
Madhavai Sharma.

1675
01:41:39,300 --> 01:41:42,030
Yes, that day in the hospital..
- Yes sir.

1676
01:41:42,100 --> 01:41:44,030
These days she is working
with me in crime week.

1677
01:41:44,100 --> 01:41:47,370
ls it? What will you have?

1678
01:41:47,540 --> 01:41:51,100
Shaukat Ali. When did
they take him away.

1679
01:41:51,370 --> 01:41:56,040
Fifteen days before. They
have booked him in POTA.

1680
01:41:56,110 --> 01:41:57,370
They don't even allow
us to meet him.

1681
01:41:57,450 --> 01:41:59,440
They say that he is an extremist.

1682
01:42:00,320 --> 01:42:02,380
Did he have a criminal record.

1683
01:43:34,210 --> 01:43:36,140
Yes doctor.

1684
01:43:38,210 --> 01:43:40,210
Come on fast.

1685
01:43:41,220 --> 01:43:42,550
Sir, there are fifteen injured.

1686
01:43:42,620 --> 01:43:44,140
Yes sir, fifteen.

1687
01:43:45,320 --> 01:43:49,160
Dead bodies? Five have reached
this hospital till now.

1688
01:43:49,230 --> 01:43:51,220
Five, yes sir.

1689
01:43:51,560 --> 01:43:53,220
l'll keep you informed sir.

1690
01:43:54,560 --> 01:43:56,160
Photographs will be taken sir.

1691
01:43:56,230 --> 01:43:57,560
Yes sir, thank you.

1692
01:44:06,680 --> 01:44:09,670
Hello. - Hi. Listen to this.
Shalini is sick.

1693
01:44:09,750 --> 01:44:12,720
She can't cover the Diwan's
marriage in Marriet.

1694
01:44:12,780 --> 01:44:14,180
You will have to cover it.

1695
01:44:14,250 --> 01:44:16,680
Sir the coverage of the blast.

1696
01:44:16,750 --> 01:44:18,850
Vinayak is there. He is
covering it, isn't it.

1697
01:44:19,590 --> 01:44:23,790
But sir, a party today? But sir..

1698
01:44:23,860 --> 01:44:28,920
Madhavi this is also work. - Ok.

1699
01:44:32,370 --> 01:44:38,860
My friend.. why did
you face away like this?

1700
01:44:40,280 --> 01:44:47,880
My friend.. why did
you face away like this?

1701
01:44:48,550 --> 01:44:53,220
l will look at the mirror.

1702
01:44:53,290 --> 01:44:55,380
l will look at the mirror.

1703
01:44:55,560 --> 01:44:57,720
lt's amazing to
travel in the first class.

1704
01:44:58,290 --> 01:44:59,730
Hi, Madhavi.
- Hi.

1705
01:44:59,800 --> 01:45:02,230
How have you been?
- Fine, thanks.

1706
01:45:02,400 --> 01:45:04,390
Long time no see, isn't it?

1707
01:45:05,300 --> 01:45:06,730
As it is, even l wasn't here.

1708
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:08,740
l was in Spain since three months.

1709
01:45:08,810 --> 01:45:10,400
For the showing of my collection.

1710
01:45:10,470 --> 01:45:12,410
Absolutely amazing.

1711
01:45:12,580 --> 01:45:15,240
l must send you some photographs.
- Sure.

1712
01:45:15,410 --> 01:45:18,900
Hi.. Hello..
- Hi..

1713
01:45:20,580 --> 01:45:24,420
You know what? Don't
you know about her?

1714
01:45:24,590 --> 01:45:26,420
She is no more with page 3.

1715
01:45:26,590 --> 01:45:28,920
What is she doing?

1716
01:45:29,330 --> 01:45:32,260
Crime beat.
- Crime beat?

1717
01:45:32,600 --> 01:45:33,760
How depressing.

1718
01:45:33,830 --> 01:45:35,420
l know.

1719
01:45:36,430 --> 01:45:38,420
Okay.

1720
01:45:38,940 --> 01:45:40,930
Will you take some time?

1721
01:45:41,340 --> 01:45:44,270
Just some time more. - Okay,
so l end up first. Take care.

1722
01:45:44,340 --> 01:45:46,430
Take a little bit of rose water.

1723
01:45:48,340 --> 01:45:51,780
You put it in and
you mix it correctly.

1724
01:45:51,950 --> 01:45:54,440
Keep mixing it for
a while and then..

1725
01:45:54,620 --> 01:45:56,450
Hi..
- l, Hi, Madhavi, how are you?

1726
01:45:56,520 --> 01:45:58,280
You are in the crime beat nowadays?

1727
01:45:58,620 --> 01:46:01,450
Yes.

1728
01:46:01,620 --> 01:46:04,620
Oh! l heard that there
was a blast in the city.

1729
01:46:04,790 --> 01:46:06,280
Oh..

1730
01:46:06,630 --> 01:46:08,290
This place is very unsafe.

1731
01:46:08,460 --> 01:46:10,460
l am very scared.

1732
01:46:11,370 --> 01:46:13,630
Okay, Madhavi.

1733
01:46:13,800 --> 01:46:15,460
Yes, so what was l saying? Take
some turmeric, and some rose water.

1734
01:46:15,540 --> 01:46:17,630
And after mixing it,
below the eyes..

1735
01:46:17,710 --> 01:46:20,640
Now, see the movement, okay?

1736
01:46:20,810 --> 01:46:23,640
What do you think? Do you think
there is some foreign hand in it?

1737
01:46:23,710 --> 01:46:24,810
l have taken the inside photos.

1738
01:46:24,980 --> 01:46:27,810
Well, we do suspect some
foreign hand behind it.

1739
01:46:27,880 --> 01:46:29,980
We aren't very sure
about it, although.

1740
01:46:30,490 --> 01:46:33,820
Anyway, our intelligence
will find out immediately.

1741
01:46:33,990 --> 01:46:36,320
Do you know, Mr. Vinay?

1742
01:46:36,390 --> 01:46:39,490
As soon as we got the call, my
force controlled it immediately.

1743
01:46:39,660 --> 01:46:42,320
That's how my force is.

1744
01:46:42,400 --> 01:46:43,830
Hi, Madhavi.

1745
01:46:43,900 --> 01:46:46,840
As it is, you don't have to
be scared of this bomb blast.

1746
01:46:46,900 --> 01:46:49,670
Because the situation
is in our control and..

1747
01:46:51,510 --> 01:46:53,340
What is the matter?

1748
01:46:54,410 --> 01:46:56,500
What is the matter?

1749
01:46:56,850 --> 01:47:00,680
Nothing, l was thinking,
there was a blast in the city,

1750
01:47:00,850 --> 01:47:05,340
There is a tension outside, the ACP
should be in his area and jurisdiction.

1751
01:47:06,860 --> 01:47:08,520
You are in a party here.

1752
01:47:09,530 --> 01:47:11,520
lt isn't even 24 hours to the blast.

1753
01:47:12,700 --> 01:47:16,030
Do you even know how
many people are injured?

1754
01:47:16,870 --> 01:47:19,530
And there are a lot of places in
your areas with communal tensions.

1755
01:47:19,600 --> 01:47:21,700
Just because of the bomb blasts.

1756
01:47:22,440 --> 01:47:24,370
There can be riots too.

1757
01:47:24,710 --> 01:47:26,540
Should you be here or there?

1758
01:47:29,050 --> 01:47:30,880
Hey, come on.
Madhavi, life moves on.

1759
01:47:30,950 --> 01:47:32,710
That's the spirit of our Mumbai.

1760
01:47:33,450 --> 01:47:35,710
lf you want to know
the spirit of Mumbai..

1761
01:47:35,790 --> 01:47:38,050
..you should have been
on the site of the blast.

1762
01:47:38,550 --> 01:47:41,720
You should have seen how
people help each other.

1763
01:47:42,960 --> 01:47:46,050
But how will you understand that?
You are in high spirits.

1764
01:47:47,900 --> 01:47:51,890
See, Madhavi. - Don't worry. The
people who died in the blast..

1765
01:47:51,970 --> 01:47:55,060
..whether their photos get printed
or not, your photos will be printed.

1766
01:47:56,470 --> 01:47:58,570
On Page 3.

1767
01:47:59,980 --> 01:48:01,570
Madhavi.. come on.

1768
01:48:05,480 --> 01:48:07,570
Waiter.. my drink.

1769
01:48:08,750 --> 01:48:10,580
Cool it.

1770
01:48:19,760 --> 01:48:23,430
That is great. lt is three
days for the bomb blast.

1771
01:48:23,770 --> 01:48:26,600
The culprit isn't caught, but the
suspect escaped from the police jeep.

1772
01:48:26,670 --> 01:48:28,760
The jeep?

1773
01:48:32,510 --> 01:48:34,440
Hey.. hello. Are you
over your bomb blast trauma?

1774
01:48:34,510 --> 01:48:36,600
Yes, sir.

1775
01:48:38,780 --> 01:48:40,440
Vinayak.
- Yes? - Well done.

1776
01:48:40,620 --> 01:48:42,610
Thank you, sir.

1777
01:48:42,790 --> 01:48:46,780
And Madhavi, well done.
- Thank you, sir, thank you.

1778
01:48:46,960 --> 01:48:49,450
What about the MLA case?

1779
01:48:49,530 --> 01:48:52,460
l am going to Nashik in that matter.

1780
01:48:52,630 --> 01:48:55,460
What shall we do about this?

1781
01:48:55,530 --> 01:48:57,620
Shall we keep her on
crime beat or back to page 3?

1782
01:48:57,800 --> 01:49:00,460
No sir. l want to
continue with this.

1783
01:49:00,540 --> 01:49:02,800
No, sir, you send her to page 3.

1784
01:49:02,970 --> 01:49:05,630
At least she won't
fight with the ACP there.

1785
01:49:05,810 --> 01:49:07,640
You know that?

1786
01:49:08,980 --> 01:49:10,810
lt is my profession to keep tabs.

1787
01:49:10,980 --> 01:49:14,470
Madhavi.. Fauziya and
Shalini are taking over.

1788
01:49:14,650 --> 01:49:16,810
They will make your boy
friend disappear from page 3.

1789
01:49:16,990 --> 01:49:18,480
l will bring him to the page one.

1790
01:49:18,990 --> 01:49:20,650
He will remain on page 3.

1791
01:49:21,060 --> 01:49:24,150
He is getting a very
big modeling assignment.

1792
01:49:24,560 --> 01:49:26,650
He didn't tell me.

1793
01:49:26,830 --> 01:49:28,660
How did you find it out?

1794
01:49:28,830 --> 01:49:31,990
l am the editor.

1795
01:49:34,840 --> 01:49:37,830
Yes, he is the editor.

1796
01:49:38,010 --> 01:49:40,500
Maybe, he wanted to surprise me.
- Candle light dinner.

1797
01:49:41,840 --> 01:49:44,180
No four.. two.

1798
01:49:45,010 --> 01:49:46,680
Good day, Madhavi.

1799
01:49:59,600 --> 01:50:03,860
Yes, Shalini. Yes.
l was stuck in the traffic.

1800
01:50:04,030 --> 01:50:05,690
Yes, l have reached right now.

1801
01:50:05,870 --> 01:50:10,700
Okay, l will talk to you a
little later. Okay? Bye.

1802
01:52:01,720 --> 01:52:03,650
Auto..

1803
01:52:41,760 --> 01:52:43,690
Khusrow..

1804
01:52:43,760 --> 01:52:47,020
Listen to me, Madhavi. Please. l am
sorry. You were hurt because of me.

1805
01:52:47,100 --> 01:52:48,860
But.. l am not the only guilty one.

1806
01:52:48,930 --> 01:52:50,960
Tarun wanted assignments from me.

1807
01:52:51,770 --> 01:52:53,700
lt is done now, Madhavi.

1808
01:52:53,770 --> 01:52:56,700
There was nothing
intentional about it.

1809
01:52:56,770 --> 01:53:00,040
Let's forget about it,
such things happen.

1810
01:53:00,780 --> 01:53:02,710
lt happens in society. Listen to me.

1811
01:53:03,780 --> 01:53:07,220
l don't want to lose a
friend like you, Madhavi.

1812
01:53:08,880 --> 01:53:10,880
Please, forget it.

1813
01:53:13,790 --> 01:53:15,720
Please..

1814
01:53:15,790 --> 01:53:17,780
Madhavi..

1815
01:53:21,800 --> 01:53:25,130
Tarun never called me, nor did l.

1816
01:53:25,200 --> 01:53:27,930
Maybe he didn't need me anymore.

1817
01:53:30,010 --> 01:53:34,740
l involved myself in work, l didn't
have time to think about anything else.

1818
01:53:34,810 --> 01:53:37,240
Whenever l got time..

1819
01:53:37,310 --> 01:53:40,750
..l used to spend time
in Anjali's children home.

1820
01:53:40,820 --> 01:53:43,250
Give it to me..

1821
01:53:59,170 --> 01:54:01,760
Rhea.. Hi..
- Hi.

1822
01:54:01,840 --> 01:54:05,770
Wow.. good work..

1823
01:54:05,840 --> 01:54:07,930
Thanks Madhavi.

1824
01:54:17,850 --> 01:54:21,190
Hello, madam. l am Munna here.

1825
01:54:21,260 --> 01:54:23,280
Yes, Munna.
- ls Vinayak there?

1826
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:25,450
No, Vinayak is in Nashik.

1827
01:54:25,530 --> 01:54:27,120
Tell me what happened?
- No, l have to give him a message.

1828
01:54:27,200 --> 01:54:29,130
Tell me.

1829
01:54:30,970 --> 01:54:32,960
Okay. Okay l will come.

1830
01:54:33,970 --> 01:54:38,410
Sir, we have got a message.
Gullu has got 25 kids from UP.

1831
01:54:40,210 --> 01:54:43,300
Sir, he has hidden them
in the Chira Bazar godown.

1832
01:54:49,890 --> 01:54:52,150
Sure?
- Yes, sir.

1833
01:54:54,890 --> 01:54:57,550
Mhatre.. take the car out.

1834
01:55:07,240 --> 01:55:09,830
Hey.. come on!

1835
01:55:20,250 --> 01:55:22,240
Come on! Don't act.

1836
01:55:22,320 --> 01:55:23,840
Stand straight.

1837
01:55:27,920 --> 01:55:29,910
Bhosle, there are ten children less.

1838
01:55:29,990 --> 01:55:31,930
There was an information about 28.

1839
01:55:36,030 --> 01:55:39,190
Hey.. Gullu. Didn't l tell you?
Where are the ten kids?

1840
01:55:39,270 --> 01:55:42,530
Please don't hit me. l will tell
you. - Tell me, come on, tell me.

1841
01:55:42,940 --> 01:55:45,030
l have left the kids at Madh lsland.

1842
01:55:45,110 --> 01:55:47,870
Where did you leave them?
- There are big parties.

1843
01:55:47,940 --> 01:55:49,380
They make them work as waiters.

1844
01:55:49,450 --> 01:55:52,880
ls it so? Come on,
tell me the address.

1845
01:55:52,950 --> 01:55:56,210
That.. Madh lsland,
bungalow number 16.

1846
01:56:02,060 --> 01:56:04,890
Satam, take him.

1847
01:56:11,230 --> 01:56:12,890
Come on! Come on!

1848
01:56:17,970 --> 01:56:20,640
Bhosale, shall we go?
- We cannot raid everywhere.

1849
01:56:21,980 --> 01:56:23,970
This is Mumbai's gutter.

1850
01:56:24,050 --> 01:56:26,110
lt is better if it stays closed.

1851
01:56:26,180 --> 01:56:27,240
What do you mean?

1852
01:56:27,320 --> 01:56:29,080
l mean, l don't have a warrant.

1853
01:56:29,990 --> 01:56:31,980
There are people above me too.

1854
01:56:32,050 --> 01:56:36,420
Vinayak had told me something
else about the way you work.

1855
01:56:37,190 --> 01:56:40,320
Bhosale.. Magistrate Joshi
will get the search warrant.

1856
01:56:40,400 --> 01:56:43,420
Come on, it is about
the lives of small kids.

1857
01:56:43,500 --> 01:56:45,090
We will have to save them.

1858
01:56:45,170 --> 01:56:47,140
Bhosale..

1859
01:57:05,020 --> 01:57:07,010
These people..

1860
01:57:07,090 --> 01:57:09,110
Come on, open the door.

1861
01:57:10,030 --> 01:57:12,020
Hey wait.. what is going on?
- Come on, didn't l tell you?

1862
01:57:12,090 --> 01:57:14,290
What is the matter?
Where are you going?

1863
01:57:18,030 --> 01:57:20,020
Why are you hitting me? - Check
everything, don't spare anyone.

1864
01:57:20,100 --> 01:57:21,970
Go there.
- There.. there..

1865
01:57:32,050 --> 01:57:34,380
These people. Stop the kissing.

1866
01:57:34,450 --> 01:57:36,140
Search for the kids.

1867
01:57:36,220 --> 01:57:38,150
Come on. Come here..

1868
01:57:38,220 --> 01:57:40,520
Look. Hey, Tom Cruise.. come on.

1869
01:57:55,070 --> 01:57:58,010
Hi.. where are the
rest of your friends?

1870

Come on. Show me.

1871
01:58:15,290 --> 01:58:17,020
Look at this. Mumbai's Baywatch.

1872
01:58:17,090 --> 01:58:19,030
Who are you? Who are you?

1873
01:58:19,090 --> 01:58:21,190
Get lost.. get out.

1874
01:58:53,460 --> 01:58:55,050
You?

1875
01:58:56,330 --> 01:58:58,060
Who sent you here?

1876
01:59:00,140 --> 01:59:02,070
Ramnath.. Gopal.. - Who do you
think you are? - Show me your badge.

1877
01:59:02,470 --> 01:59:04,410
Gaikwad. Take the children.

1878
01:59:04,470 --> 01:59:05,570
Security..

1879
01:59:05,640 --> 01:59:07,070
What the bloody hell.

1880
01:59:08,480 --> 01:59:10,070
Take them..

1881
01:59:17,490 --> 01:59:19,250
What do you think of yourselves?

1882
01:59:20,490 --> 01:59:22,580
l will take care of you.

1883
01:59:23,430 --> 01:59:26,760
Bastard.. made the wife
and daughter sleep first.

1884
01:59:26,830 --> 01:59:30,090
Pimp for fair flesh, you pimp!

1885
01:59:30,500 --> 01:59:32,760
You are very excited, isn't it?

1886
01:59:33,170 --> 01:59:35,160
You are in heat?

1887
01:59:36,170 --> 01:59:40,510
Thapar.. you have less money
that you are making children sleep?

1888
01:59:40,580 --> 01:59:42,100
Come on!
- Don't worry.

1889
01:59:51,450 --> 01:59:53,110
Sir, l am Madhavi.

1890
01:59:53,190 --> 01:59:54,310
Yes, tell me.

1891
01:59:54,390 --> 01:59:55,790
Sir, l have very important news.

1892
01:59:55,860 --> 01:59:57,620
Breaking news. We will
have to stop the press.

1893
01:59:57,690 --> 02:00:00,130
Why? - l will come and explain
everything. Yes, it is important.

1894
02:00:00,200 --> 02:00:02,130
Okay.

1895
02:00:02,300 --> 02:00:04,130
l will come the office right now.

1896
02:00:04,200 --> 02:00:06,530
Okay, fine. Come on, Kedar.

1897
02:00:28,220 --> 02:00:30,160
Sir..

1898
02:00:31,560 --> 02:00:33,150
See..

1899
02:01:00,460 --> 02:01:02,180
Good work, Madhavi.

1900
02:01:03,590 --> 02:01:05,860
Well shots, Kedar.

1901
02:01:05,930 --> 02:01:07,520
Thanks, sir.

1902
02:01:09,260 --> 02:01:11,360
You go home.

1903
02:01:12,270 --> 02:01:14,200
l will take care of everything else.

1904
02:01:14,270 --> 02:01:16,930
Thank you, sir.

1905
02:01:18,470 --> 02:01:20,810
Thank you.
- Come on.

1906
02:01:23,280 --> 02:01:24,710
Sir, my bag.

1907
02:01:24,780 --> 02:01:26,210
Thank you sir, good night.
- Good night.

1908
02:01:33,620 --> 02:01:35,210
Sir.. child abuse.

1909
02:01:35,290 --> 02:01:37,620
They were under age children.

1910
02:01:37,690 --> 02:01:39,630
Leave Mr. Thapar now.

1911
02:01:39,690 --> 02:01:41,220
Drugs were being consumed there.

1912
02:01:41,300 --> 02:01:43,630
Don't argue with me, okay?

1913
02:01:43,700 --> 02:01:46,900
lgnore everything and move
out of there with your men.

1914
02:01:46,970 --> 02:01:50,430
Give it to Mr. Thapar now.
- Sir.

1915
02:01:54,310 --> 02:01:57,240
Yes?
- How are you? - l am fine.

1916
02:01:57,310 --> 02:02:00,750
Everything is done, okay?
- Yes, Mr. Kadam. - Take care.

1917
02:02:03,590 --> 02:02:05,420
Thank you for your help,
Mr. Bhosale.

1918
02:02:06,320 --> 02:02:08,310
Let's go, Marvin.

1919
02:02:12,660 --> 02:02:15,600
Gaikwad, release everyone.
- Yes, sir.

1920
02:02:16,670 --> 02:02:18,760
l will keep you informed
about the developments.

1921
02:02:18,830 --> 02:02:22,430
No.. l will take
care of the fix myself.

1922
02:02:22,500 --> 02:02:26,270
Mr. Kadam, our
relations go way back.

1923
02:02:26,340 --> 02:02:29,940
Don't worry. l will
take care of the rest.

1924
02:02:30,010 --> 02:02:32,000
Okay, bye bye.

1925
02:02:35,350 --> 02:02:39,010
Driver, go out.
- Yes, sir.

1926
02:02:45,560 --> 02:02:47,290
This is all of it?

1927
02:02:47,360 --> 02:02:49,490
They are all the evidence.

1928
02:02:51,630 --> 02:02:54,300
We shouldn't leave this story.

1929
02:02:55,700 --> 02:02:58,700
He is a sick man. This
should be published.

1930
02:02:58,770 --> 02:03:00,300
Are you crazy?

1931
02:03:00,380 --> 02:03:03,310
We get the most
advertising revenue..

1932
02:03:03,380 --> 02:03:06,370
..from the Thapar Group of companies
and their foreign collaborators.

1933
02:03:06,450 --> 02:03:08,310
That means, money.

1934
02:03:08,380 --> 02:03:11,380
And don't you know
about their lobby?

1935
02:03:20,600 --> 02:03:22,720
Yes, Mr. Kadam.

1936
02:03:22,800 --> 02:03:24,320
Yes, tell me.

1937
02:03:24,400 --> 02:03:26,870
Tell Mr. Thapar not to worry,
every thing will be in control.

1938
02:03:26,940 --> 02:03:28,870
Fine, Mr. Mirchandani.

1939
02:03:28,940 --> 02:03:30,340
Bye, bye.

1940
02:03:34,410 --> 02:03:36,400
What is the name of that girl?

1941
02:03:41,620 --> 02:03:43,550
Sir, she is a good journalist.

1942
02:03:44,750 --> 02:03:47,020
We will lose a good journalist.

1943
02:03:47,090 --> 02:03:48,350
Fire the bitch.

1944
02:03:51,430 --> 02:03:53,360
Remove her.

1945
02:03:56,430 --> 02:03:58,370
You may leave now.

1946
02:04:00,440 --> 02:04:01,700
Good night, sir.

1947
02:04:16,790 --> 02:04:18,380
Come in.

1948
02:04:24,460 --> 02:04:26,390
Why didn't the article get printed?

1949
02:04:27,460 --> 02:04:29,900
We had stopped the press.

1950
02:04:29,970 --> 02:04:31,560
Was it very late?

1951
02:04:32,470 --> 02:04:34,400
Sir..

1952
02:04:38,470 --> 02:04:40,410
Would you like to sit down, Madhavi?

1953
02:04:40,480 --> 02:04:42,410
No.

1954
02:05:04,830 --> 02:05:06,930
This was not done, sir.

1955
02:05:08,500 --> 02:05:10,490
This is not done.

1956
02:05:13,610 --> 02:05:16,040
l thought that you would help me.

1957
02:05:20,520 --> 02:05:22,950
l.. l believed in you, sir.

1958
02:05:24,520 --> 02:05:27,610
lt was the question of
small children's lives.

1959
02:05:29,720 --> 02:05:31,620
And you know that.

1960
02:05:32,530 --> 02:05:34,460
Why?

1961
02:05:37,530 --> 02:05:39,630
Why did you do that?

1962
02:05:39,700 --> 02:05:41,640
lt was a good story, Madhavi.

1963
02:05:43,740 --> 02:05:45,470
Good story.

1964
02:06:57,610 --> 02:06:59,550
Yes, sir.

1965
02:06:59,610 --> 02:07:01,710
l understand sir, but..

1966
02:07:01,780 --> 02:07:03,550
Sorry, ma'am. We have
already hired somebody.

1967
02:07:03,620 --> 02:07:04,950
Mail your resume.
We will get back to you.

1968
02:07:05,020 --> 02:07:07,210
Okay. Thank you.

1969
02:07:43,860 --> 02:07:45,590
No. l will look for some other job.

1970
02:07:45,660 --> 02:07:48,990
lt is easy to run from the truth.
lt is difficult to face it.

1971
02:07:49,060 --> 02:07:52,090
l was trying to tell
the truth, isn't it?

1972
02:07:52,170 --> 02:07:56,330
But nobody wants to listen.
- lt isn't like that.

1973
02:07:56,670 --> 02:07:58,610
The people want to
listen to the truth.

1974
02:07:58,670 --> 02:08:00,140
How do we tell that?
Thapar's story was laid down.

1975
02:08:00,210 --> 02:08:01,800
lt was your fault.
- Why?

1976
02:08:02,680 --> 02:08:06,010
lt was wrong for you to
dare to cover the story.

1977
02:08:06,680 --> 02:08:10,780
And secondly, you gave all the
proof. Didn't keep anything with you.

1978
02:08:10,850 --> 02:08:13,150
Why did you believe
in people, Madhavi?

1979
02:08:13,690 --> 02:08:16,120
The system will want
to stop you, isn't it?

1980
02:08:16,190 --> 02:08:19,350
Do you know why Anjali
Thapar committed suicide?

1981
02:08:19,890 --> 02:08:22,620
Because she found
out that her husband..

1982
02:08:22,700 --> 02:08:26,960
..was picking up kids from
her orphanage and with them..

1983
02:08:28,970 --> 02:08:32,030
Madhavi.. it is
necessary to tell the truth.

1984
02:08:32,110 --> 02:08:36,370
lt is important to
find out how to tell that.

1985
02:08:36,710 --> 02:08:39,650
Sense is as
necessary as being honest is.

1986
02:08:39,850 --> 02:08:42,180
We have to be in the system..

1987
02:08:42,250 --> 02:08:44,240
..to change the system.

1988
02:08:45,720 --> 02:08:47,650
Remember this.

1989
02:08:51,160 --> 02:08:55,390
See, Madhavi, there is a
job in my publication.

1990
02:08:55,830 --> 02:08:59,320
But not the beat that you want.

1991
02:09:00,740 --> 02:09:03,670
l can just give you
the page three beat.

1992
02:09:04,740 --> 02:09:06,830
And l think, you are
best suited for that.

1993
02:09:08,740 --> 02:09:11,210
Tell me. Will you do it?

1994
02:09:32,770 --> 02:09:35,200
Yeah. Just need to keep
it on for a few more days.

1995
02:09:38,970 --> 02:09:40,700
You cover it there,
l will come, okay?

1996
02:09:42,040 --> 02:09:44,710
We will meet page
3's regular celebrity..

1997
02:09:44,780 --> 02:09:47,870
..and the host of this party,
Mr. Hiren Sanghvi.

1998
02:09:48,120 --> 02:09:52,710
Mr. Sanghvi, how do you feel on your
company's first year anniversary bash?

1999
02:09:52,790 --> 02:09:55,720
Oh, it's great. lndia is great!

2000
02:09:55,790 --> 02:09:59,250
l mean.. my business
turnover is hundred crores.

2001
02:09:59,330 --> 02:10:01,890
Bombay is really rocking.

2002
02:10:02,060 --> 02:10:05,120
Shall l tell it in English?

2003
02:10:05,200 --> 02:10:06,720
No, thank you, l got it.
- Or in hindi?

2004
02:10:07,900 --> 02:10:10,740
Hey, welcome back. - lt's been
so long. We really missed you.

2005
02:10:11,140 --> 02:10:12,730
Really?

2006
02:10:15,010 --> 02:10:16,270
Aren't you drinking?

2007
02:10:16,340 --> 02:10:18,740
l have given up drinking.

2008
02:10:18,810 --> 02:10:20,080
Well, cheers for you then.

2009
02:10:20,150 --> 02:10:23,140
You are everywhere. l
see you in a lot of ads.

2010
02:10:24,820 --> 02:10:28,080
Good luck.

2011
02:10:28,160 --> 02:10:30,750
Hi, Madhavi. - Hi. - Madhavi. You

Tarun, tell me, why

2019
02:10:48,180 --> 02:10:54,170
The ambitions are

'The ambitions are

Let it be.
- So, what is your program now?
