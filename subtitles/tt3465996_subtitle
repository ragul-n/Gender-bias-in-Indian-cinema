1
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:24,778
Thenmala, Kerala-Tamilnadu
boarder region.

2
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:26,715
Why do people talk?

3
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:30,579
To say it in simple terms, to make
others understand what is inside.

4
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:33,586
But, does anyone think about
intention and goal of talking?

5
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:36,623
When someone talks to others?

6
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:40,228
The right things at right
time we often forget to talk.

7
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:41,694
Haven't you given this even now?

8
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:42,765
Scared man!

9
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,926
But, in the times when it
is not at all required.

10
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,831
Un necessary we speak
about lot of things.

11
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:49,405
All this must be questioned.

12
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,872
Look, when the night falls to
turn on these street lights.

13
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:54,239
Can the Panchayat do
anything on that regard?

14
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:57,576
I thought now only, there is an
urgent meeting of standing committee.

15
00:03:57,704 --> 00:04:01,208
To some, there is no problem on
talking to any one seen or heard.

16
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:01,715
Tell man.

17
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:04,822
But to talk to family and relatives
there will be no time at all.

18
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:06,753
All this I have told you, is it not?

19
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:09,857
Do one thing, I'll come
there okay then.

20
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:14,362
There are some other kinds of
people who keeps on talking non stop.

21
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:16,894
Still, in front of this?

22
00:04:17,056 --> 00:04:18,831
Since I'm unaware, I'm asking you.

23
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:20,403
What is your thought?

24
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:23,435
Study decently, secure a good job.

25
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,007
Don't do all this!

26
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:29,975
What to talk? How to talk?
When to talk?

27
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,681
When not to talk.

28
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:35,718
Without knowing all this what all
problems are created on each day.

29
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:39,813
I'm delivering is it? You wait.

30
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:46,327
Why man talking in English, I even
don't know Tamil, then why English?

31
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:49,396
The problems because
of the tongue in the mouth.

32
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:50,932
When it will be over?

33
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:54,004
Perhaps when not being able to
speak opening the mouth, at least.

34
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:57,638
Will the problems of human
beings find an end?

35
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:18,591
'Talking harmful to heath'

36
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:35,906
"Never talk all this things"
"And make it a talk of the town"

37
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:38,913
"On touching the heart
Again can the singing be done silently?"

38
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:44,317
"Never sing what ever
you see, as a song"

39
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:47,084
"Slowly you don't close
the mouth again"

40
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:50,924
"Hey shut up!
Close the mouth, no talking"

41
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:54,724
"Hey shut up!
Close the mouth, no talking"

42
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,834
Talking is injurious to health.

43
00:05:56,989 --> 00:05:59,060
"Hey shut up!
Close the mouth, no talking"

44
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,099
It's shut up!

45
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:03,137
"Hey shut up!
Close the mouth, no talking"

46
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:05,443
Talking is injurious to health.

47
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:11,506
Will you be silent? My
concentration is going.

48
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:14,879
Tell, something fellow!

49
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:17,785
How come he is not
saying anything?

50
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,483
Not dance man, its chicken.

51
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:23,759
"Whatever that is seen
on the by gone paths"

52
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:26,055
"You don't come later
and say all that"

53
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:28,165
"With the stories you don't
have to go anywhere"

54
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:29,865
Hey man, how long
have been asking?

55
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:34,572
"On hearing all this ears
don't just nod as dumb"

56
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,832
"On touching the heart
Can the singing be done silently?"

57
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:38,805
My concentration is going.

58
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,891
Bravo! Great!

59
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,434
"Hey shut up!
Close the mouth, no talking"

60
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:28,491
Today, we have with us.

61
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:31,595
To make the orange
more colorful, tasteful.

62
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:38,501
Cochin's Jaan!

63
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:41,030
My name is Sh..Aa..N.

64
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:48,208
Shaan, ever before have
you come to Thenmala?

65
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:49,876
How is our native?

66
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:55,648
The people out here, the bus,
the omelet, the travels out here...

67
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:58,923
This is God's own 'mala' (Mountain)

68
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:00,850
Thenmala, is God's mountain.

69
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:06,855
Any way Shaan, has really
liked the cold in the Thenmala.

70
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:09,192
So like that Thenmala, has
also liked Shaan very much.

71
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:11,233
Shaan, is keeping on coughing.

72
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:15,630
To get rid off Shaan's cough, I'm
going to give a real hot coffee to Shaan.

73
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:18,568
Till then we will take a small break.

74
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:20,903
What you are listening
is Orange F.M

75
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,908
Cochin's own Jaan!

76
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:34,985
Madam, must bless me.

77
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:36,593
Who are you? What is it?

78
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:38,592
On waking up today morning
whose face have you seen first?

79
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:39,889
Why to know all that?

80
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:41,257
Simply, tell madam.

81
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:42,759
My daughter's.

82
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:44,128
That is why, that is why, like this.

83
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:45,132
Like what?

84
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,861
Even othenlvise will I feel like to...

85
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,165
...come to this house alone,
with such a great product like this?

86
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:50,266
Mr. Fix it.

87
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:52,940
Let it be torn or broken be it
paper, rubber, plastic, glass.

88
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:53,873
Cloth or money.

89
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,273
Whatever it may be. Anything it is.

90
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:59,947
A baloon like this when poking
like this, will blast making a sound.

91
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:01,277
When a drop of
Mr. Fix it, is applied.

92
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:02,119
On blowing again.

93
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:04,050
Baloon is blown up again as
ajack fruit, can't you see it?

94
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,817
From the pipe which
has a hole to broken heart.

95
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:08,219
It is a wonder glue
which can be sticked.

96
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:09,291
Mr. Fix it.

97
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,988
No need, here it is not required.

98
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:14,790
Madam, it is not like ordinary glue.

99
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:16,092
Shall I show a small demo?

100
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:17,791
5 minutes will finish it fast.

101
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:19,698
No need, there is
no time that is why.

102
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:21,733
Madam, madam, one minute.

103
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:23,200
What had happened
to child's Barbie?

104
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:24,831
Oh! That is an old one.

105
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:25,998
Should throw that
and buy a new one.

106
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:28,305
It's not like that, daughter has
got a special liking towards that doll.

107
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:30,044
Can brother mend your doll?

108
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:31,270
No need of all that.

109
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:33,078
Don't be afraid madam,
you don't buy this.

110
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:34,717
If anything that is seen faulty.

111
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:37,014
If it's not mended out,
I'll not get peace of mind.

112
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:37,780
That is why.

113
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:49,825
Not that, what did you say
what all can be glued with this?

114
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:01,844
What happened Shaan?

115
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:02,675
Coughing real hard.

116
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:03,611
Is there fever?

117
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:06,844
While waking up in the
morning there was no problem.

118
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:09,152
While coming from the hotel, throat...

119
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,184
I think it is because of climate.

120
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:14,291
I don't want tea or coffee.

121
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,125
Bring one glass of hot
water to the studio.

122
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:20,363
Is there any amplifier
fitted on your mouth?

123
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:20,859
Will shout.

124
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,864
I'll again shout, let the
entire compatriots know it.

125
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:23,626
What is it?

126
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:25,599
My name is Aravind.

127
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:26,066
So what?

128
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:27,170
Hey lady, who is that?

129
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:28,761
What is it to you?
Whoever it may be.

130
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:30,874
If it is some fund collectors,
they should be avoided now itself.

131
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,203
I don't intend to.

132
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:34,368
Looks like the time
I came is not that much right.

133
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:35,741
I'll go and come back later.

134
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:37,870
He will simply shout from there.

135
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:40,213
You wait there tell the matter why
you had come, only then you can go.

136
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:40,841
That is...

137
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:44,217
Are you the husband or am 'I the
husband? I want to know that today.

138
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:47,884
Are you deaf or what?
You were told to go, is it not?

139
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:48,721
Brother already gone.

140
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:49,782
Hey wait there!

141
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:51,284
Did I tell to go?

142
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:52,422
Who is this fellow of yours?

143
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:53,924
Who are you fellow?

144
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,791
Tell the truth you fellow! What
is the dealing between you two?

145
00:10:56,922 --> 00:10:58,799
Dealings? Brother don't
say by God's forbid.

146
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:00,904
By looking at this sister's face can
anything like that felt to say?

147
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,898
Hey fellow, what
is wrong with my face?

148
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:05,909
Tell, you fellow what is
wrong with my face?

149
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:07,874
Understood.

150
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:08,741
What did you understand?

151
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:10,845
Understood what is the
problem between you two.

152
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:13,379
Brother, never used to say
a good word about sister.

153
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:14,110
Is it not true?

154
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,014
For that she...

155
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:16,245
Brother, let me say.

156
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:18,983
And sister will not let the
brother to move freely.

157
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,054
Too much of controlling.

158
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:22,283
For that he sits always
on my head, 24 hours.

159
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:23,451
Let m e say.

160
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:25,286
When one person talks other
person is not listening to it.

161
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:26,294
Then how can it be corrected?

162
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:29,798
Only if a gap is given to talk, only
then brother can say good about sister.

163
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:31,825
Only on feeling when love
and affection is there.

164
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:33,426
Sister can obey to
what brother says.

165
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:36,273
When one person lowers a bit
these problems are only that much.

166
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:37,774
Even othenlvise I know.

167
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,900
I'm the one who should always
lower and to be defeated always.

168
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:42,703
I know I should be lowered
and defeated at all times.

169
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,905
This is all not an issue at all brother.

170
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:46,984
Just tell sister as I tell you.

171
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:04,297
With this song we will
wind up the show.

172
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:06,232
Shaan's throat is getting
strained a lot.

173
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:06,700
No...

174
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:09,764

She is seeing you as a
daughter, is it notAnju?

to look after us.

348
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:09,933
All Kerala Drunkards Association.

349
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:10,970
L\\

350
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:12,734
President Salsa Kuttan.

351
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:13,706
Became set up.

352
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:15,039
Brother, your loin cloth is slipping off.

353
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:16,946
If gone from the waist...

354
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:18,972
...Will on the shoulders!

355
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:21,580
Why fellows. Even the loin
cloth is not respecting us?

356
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:25,911
From Parasala to Kasargod
Boomesh fans association members.

357
00:22:25,977 --> 00:22:28,389
Our world class star brother
Boomen, extending him support.

358
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:30,825
Have reached Thenmala,
with a bike rally.

359
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:32,826
Those drunkards who
are out of mind, if they intends.

360
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:34,953
Can't even touch our
brother Boom en's mere hair!

361
00:22:35,153 --> 00:22:36,894
We are also people
who drinks little bit.

362
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:39,400
On hearing brother Boomen's that
dialogue we have not felt any shame.

363
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:42,062
This is all intentionally a
play to belittle this movie.

364
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:44,664
At any cost we will conduct
this shooting here itself.

365
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:51,344
'A peculiar disease at Thenmala'

366
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:53,416
To evaluate the situation.

367
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:55,383
The respected health
department minister.

368
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:56,612
Sri. Prabakaran Thachapuzha.

369
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:59,712
Today will visit Thenmala, that is
what the official sources informed.

370
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:03,657
On his visit more details on the
disease will be chalked out.

371
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:04,886
That is what is expected.

372
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:09,931
No, minister can not
be met, call after some time.

373
00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:12,435
Big nuisance!

374
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:16,032
Whatever you say, for
one hour minister cannot be met.

375
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:17,868
One hour before also, you had
told the same thing is it not?

376
00:23:17,996 --> 00:23:19,669
To say, minister is on
'aasanam'(a yoga posture)

377
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:20,607
What 'aasanam'?

378
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:21,870
Yoga posture.

379
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:24,743
After lunch, one hour minister
will do the yoga postures.

380
00:23:24,836 --> 00:23:26,372
Only after that, rest of the things.

381
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,156
How come the finger
is tucked inside the nose?

MC Movie Channel

383
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:49,167
My heavens!

384
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:51,472
Will just give one kick!

385
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:54,844
My dear Sasi, have
told you thousand times.

386
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,843
Don't come suddenly
like this and scare me.

387
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:58,003
Sir, I've not come suddenly.

388
00:23:58,136 --> 00:23:59,410
It's been quite long since I came.

389
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:02,178
Whether suddenly or slowly what
is seen is this ugly face is it not?

390
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:05,517
Sir, this news paper and
T.V men are waiting for so long.

391
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:08,118
Pull me up.

392
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:12,151
Even the doctors don't
know what this disease is?

393
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:15,220
Then what can I
say to the journalists?

394
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:19,161
Right from morning bombarded
with phone calls.

395
00:24:19,524 --> 00:24:20,764
Is the disease true?

396
00:24:20,892 --> 00:24:22,963
What is the name and
details of the disease?

397
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:24,631
Is it contagious or not?

398
00:24:24,729 --> 00:24:25,707
This one or that one!

399
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:28,539
Central health research
department's e-mail has come.

400
00:24:28,733 --> 00:24:29,711
What are those people saying?

401
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:32,077
Sir, it is confirmed that
this disease is present there.

402
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:33,649
Oh! Happy!

403
00:24:34,072 --> 00:24:35,813
Now to everyone it can
be told boldly, is it not?

404
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:38,653
Sir, I've requested for
the press meet.

405
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,583
Yes, you will tell!

406
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:43,888
On calling the press meet, you can
simply stand in the side as the pole.

407
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:46,256
I'm the one who is struggling
for their questions.

408
00:24:46,718 --> 00:24:51,098
For me on seeing this T.V mens
mike, from the navel a lump will arise.

409
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:54,730
Not that, sir do we have to
take any urgent actions?

410
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,134
What actions?

411
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,498
Or do one thing, in the city.

412
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:02,579
What the traffic police
wears...That thing is there, no?

413
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:03,771
Sir, which thing?

414
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:04,847
Oh! Is it the mask?

415
00:25:04,936 --> 00:25:08,247
Yea that is it. You give the
order for 20,000 masks.

416
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:11,920
For that, it is not confirmed yet
whether it is contagious or not.

417
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,580
Hey Chettuvaran Sasi.

418
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:13,917
Yes.

419
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:16,515
What is inside your
head, brain or clay?

420
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:19,795
Hey man! We should make a
feeling that we had done something.

421
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:20,589
You fool!

422
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,099
Tomorrow the sight all the
compatriots of Thenmala.

423
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:24,792
Fixing the mask and walking.

424
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:26,834
It should come in all
the channels of Kerala.

425
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:28,266
That will be an event.

426
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:38,881
I'll tell I'm calling the press meet.

427
00:25:39,004 --> 00:25:40,108
Everything in detail
will be told there.

428
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:41,275
You may kindly disperse.

429
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,076
Disperse, will talk later.

MC Movie Channel

431
00:25:58,356 --> 00:25:59,334
Wait, wait.

432
00:25:59,624 --> 00:26:01,126
One minute, will give.

433
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:02,795
Will give to everyone.

434
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:03,134
Wait!

435
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:06,206
Brother Aravind.

436
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:09,304
Wait, don't get up.

437
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:10,342
Wait, wait!

438
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:11,577
Here.

439
00:26:13,271 --> 00:26:15,273
Did he tell you to help him?

440
00:26:16,174 --> 00:26:16,811
No, is it?

441
00:26:16,942 --> 00:26:19,149
Then what? He will walk
all by himself.

442
00:26:30,221 --> 00:26:31,825
What happened? To come early.

443
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:34,564
That is got the salary
early, that is why.

444
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:38,630
Look, does everyone in the world
can live only with your salary?

445
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:46,846
I'll also look after the
expenses in my house.

446
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:47,712
Only that much is there, no.

447
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:48,876
What is the big deal on this?

448
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:51,246
Boy, you look after
your own affairs first.

449
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:54,016
When becoming a big R.J
and earning lot of money.

450
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,614
Then only, this helping
attitude is enough.

451
00:26:57,215 --> 00:26:58,592
I don't have that much expenses.

452
00:26:58,984 --> 00:26:59,985
The only thing is room rent.

453
00:27:00,318 --> 00:27:01,820
Even if I'm evicted from there,
I don't have any problems.

454
00:27:01,987 --> 00:27:03,864
How long I've been saying,
I'll come here and stay?

455
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:06,696
Hey fellow, what is the name
we have put for this house?

456
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:07,797
Nest.

457
00:27:07,892 --> 00:27:10,964
Till being able to fly, for the
birds to stay the place is nest.

458
00:27:11,229 --> 00:27:12,230
All must...

459
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:13,968
Create their own life.

460
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:15,169
You should be also like that.

461
00:27:15,233 --> 00:27:17,144
Then after marrying a smart girl.

462
00:27:17,235 --> 00:27:18,305
Should live happily.

463
00:27:18,403 --> 00:27:19,381
All that I'll do aftewvards.

464
00:27:19,437 --> 00:27:20,848
Now collect the half of this.

465
00:27:20,905 --> 00:27:21,645
No need.

466
00:27:23,775 --> 00:27:26,688
Athira, give this to mother.

467
00:27:27,178 --> 00:27:27,417
Hey fellow!

468
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:46,136
It's been quite long drinking
coffee from the empty glass.

469
00:27:46,931 --> 00:27:48,672
Trying to tune that channel or what?

470
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:50,906
Can't see the face.

471
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:52,740
Hey fellow, even I've
not seen so far.

472
00:27:52,937 --> 00:27:54,280
So don't you know how is it to look?

473
00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:55,817
What to do man?

474
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,681
Before I reaching here,
she will come here.

475
00:27:57,776 --> 00:27:59,687
Then till I start for sales from here.

476
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:01,849
She will be sitting there
itself, won't move.

477
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:03,455
You go and take the initiative.

478
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:05,089
Is it not? Like that people meet.

479
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:08,222
When I open the mouth other
than non sense what will come out?

480
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,956
On saying should require
at the estate.

481
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:12,032
It will become is required in the shit!

482
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:13,300
That is all because of your fear.

483
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:14,927
The connection with my
head and mouth.

484
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:16,870
Hey man, there is
some lose contact.

485
00:28:17,328 --> 00:28:18,932
When it is required
nothing can be said.

486
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,338
But when the tension comes.

487
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,369
Only foul language will
come to the tongue.

488
00:28:23,468 --> 00:28:24,139
Hey man!

489
00:28:24,235 --> 00:28:25,179
She got up.

490
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:32,411
You have no problem
when you talk now.

491
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:36,021
On talking to you there is no tension.

492
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:38,120
Coming to this side.

493
00:28:38,183 --> 00:28:39,423
You talk some thing
and make the move.

494
00:28:39,517 --> 00:28:41,463
Hey man, don't go
what should I talk?

495
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,957
Without fear just talk, she
is not going to eat you and all.

496
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:56,743
Sadeesha! Smiled man, this
is the best time, go man!

497
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:57,470
What to say?

498
00:28:59,537 --> 00:29:00,777
Forgot the dialogue also.

499
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:04,181
When the coffee glass
gets filled she will go Sadeesha!

500
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:07,288
Girl, smiling place looks
like sitting place.

501
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:08,481
That is not the thing.

502
00:29:08,546 --> 00:29:10,492
Say something and make
the move, Sadeesha!

503
00:29:10,548 --> 00:29:11,219
Look, she is going.

504
00:29:14,552 --> 00:29:15,394
That is because.

505
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,158
When looking from the back.

506
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:20,266
Not that.

507
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:22,304
When seeing from the front...Back!

508
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:25,103
Child is.

509
00:29:25,196 --> 00:29:26,903
On seeing the sitting place
felt like smiling place.

510
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:28,767
Not that one.

511
00:29:32,303 --> 00:29:33,179
Bum!

512
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:37,853
What is spread across Thenmala.

513
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:39,148
To explain on
un identified disease.

514
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:42,851
Respected health minister Sri.
Prabakaran Thachapuzha.

515
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:44,325
Had called for a press meet.

516
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:47,055
Now can see the live
telecast of press meet.

517
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:51,224
In the district of Idukki,
at the region of Thenmala.

518
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:52,561
A disease named dumb flue.

519
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:55,269
Is widely seen. It has been proved,
after the examinations.

520
00:29:55,393 --> 00:29:59,398
Those who are effected with
this disease. The ability to talk.

521
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:00,202
The chances to lose
the talking ability are high.

522
00:30:00,265 --> 00:30:01,403
That has been
found out, by this time.

523
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:04,208
Those who are
infected only in the tongue.

524
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:06,044
Their sound will not be lost.

525
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:08,174
But slowly, there are chances
that the virus may effect

526
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:09,445
the sound pipes also.

527
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:12,576
If it happens like that,
the sound faculty is lost.

528
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:14,318
Virus from the tongue.

529
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:17,323
What is this?
Vocal cord.

530
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:18,520
Hey man, can't you
write it in Malayalam?

531
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:21,787
To spread it to the vocal chord.

532
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:25,868
The time for that is dependent on
the individuals, preventive power.

533
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:29,571
Sneezing, throat pain,
sudden swelling in the tongue.

534
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:33,404
Getting dried, cough, itching.
Those who find the symptoms.

535
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:35,569
Must succumb to
examination immediately.

536
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:38,101
Including at the
preliminary health centers.

537
00:30:38,102 --> 00:30:40,270
For this, all the
arrangements are being done.

538
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:42,080
It is only from Thenmala.

539
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:45,246
Such reports of this
disease is obtained so far.

540
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:49,883
As this disease is not seen
in other parts of Kerala.

541
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:52,224
Till more information is
received, no one is allowed...

542
00:30:52,283 --> 00:30:57,062
...to go out from Thenmala.

543
00:30:58,022 --> 00:30:59,933
Then is it confirmed it is contagious?

544
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:02,528
Now, only like a climate prediction
anything can be told.

545
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:05,631
May or may not be
contagious, there are chances.

546
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,366
In the case as told,
no should leave the Thenmala.

547
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:10,174
You might be around here, is it not?
No, no I'll go.

548
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:12,237
No, we can't go.

549
00:31:12,303 --> 00:31:14,044
You go and tell that at Mapranam.

550
00:31:14,138 --> 00:31:15,344
Wife's sister is
there, no. Sini Mol.

551
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,612
Sunday it's her marriage.

552
00:31:16,674 --> 00:31:19,154
If I don't go, then Ratnama,
will chop below my waist.

553
00:31:19,477 --> 00:31:21,252
Journalists, T.\/. Camera.

554
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:24,225
As the noble language status
declaration is completed.

555
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:25,659
Aren't there any Malayalam
name given for the disease?

556
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:28,660
If it is that necessary.

557
00:31:28,953 --> 00:31:31,154
Write it as 'Ooma pani'
(fever that creates dumbness)

558
00:31:31,155 --> 00:31:32,190
<i>Yes, Ooma Pam.</i>

559
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:51,212
Whose face did you see first?
On waking up in the morning.

560
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:56,509
MC Movie Channel

561
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:12,336
Hey man.

562
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,501
They are putting some thing
in the nose and checking.

563
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,010
Dude, it's some big disease.

564
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:18,206
All that will not affect us.

565
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:21,045
Simply bringing me here.
Who was sleeping in the house.

566
00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:22,205
Are you haPPV7

567
00:32:22,206 --> 00:32:24,152
Anjana, crowd is high.

568
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:27,015
You also go with junior
doctors and take the patienfs test.

569
00:32:33,051 --> 00:32:36,019
What you told is true.
Coming here is good.

570
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,591
Not good, really good.

571
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,527
Blow it on this.

572
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:42,260
Is it the nose?

573
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:48,502
For me the paper is allergic.

574
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:50,170
This is only to clean the nose.

575
00:32:50,234 --> 00:32:51,474
If you have the
hand-kerchief with you.

576
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:52,411
Can use that one.

577
00:32:52,503 --> 00:32:55,484
Not in hand.
Can you adjust one and give?

578
00:32:55,573 --> 00:32:56,677
What?

579
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:58,516
If it is the shawl of this Churidar,
that will be also fine.

580
00:33:03,114 --> 00:33:04,559
Tilt the head backwards.

581
00:33:04,615 --> 00:33:05,593
Should not move.

582
00:33:07,118 --> 00:33:08,722
Does the result of
this be obtained fast?

583
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:12,197
Look.
That will take few days.

584
00:33:12,256 --> 00:33:13,462
Will you sit without moving?

585
00:33:13,591 --> 00:33:15,161
Buddy, that item is good is it not?

586
00:33:21,366 --> 00:33:24,108
It's okay.
It's my mistake.

587
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:25,679
As a doctor I should
have taken attention.

588
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,549
It is all right, doctor.

589
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:30,709
Any way, it was
not blood test, luckily.

590
00:33:31,776 --> 00:33:34,222
Doctor, didn't say your name?
Anjana.

591
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,159
My name is Aravind.
Shall I leave?

592
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:42,122
Wanted to say a thing,
planning to say for time.

593
00:33:42,286 --> 00:33:44,766
Janakiamma, had told that son must
not be intimated with all this matters.

594
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:46,266
Brother, tell the matter.

595
00:33:46,424 --> 00:33:49,428
The owner of this building
where the orphanage is remaining.

596
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:50,505
Tam pi Durai.

597
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:53,200
He raised our rent all of a sudden.

598
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:56,474
On telling, will see whether
with you can be negotiated.

599
00:33:57,135 --> 00:33:58,580
Janakiam ma, is not listening to that.

600
00:33:58,736 --> 00:33:59,544
Why is that?

601
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:02,139
May be on thinking what is there
simply hearing from the mouth of that,

602
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:04,450
Tam pi Durai, you
shouldn't be made to hear.

603
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:06,720
In my mouth also,
there is tongue only.

604
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:08,290
Any way let me go and meet him.

605
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:15,261
Aravind.
Brother are you here now?

606
00:34:15,319 --> 00:34:16,593
For some time, I'm here only.
How come you are here?

607
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:18,529
Came to meet Tam pi, sir.

608
00:34:18,856 --> 00:34:19,766
Our orphanage is there, no?

609
00:34:20,324 --> 00:34:21,462
Came to discuss a matter on that.

610
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:22,766
Is it regarding the
issue of that building?

611
00:34:23,127 --> 00:34:24,629
That mother from
there, came 4 to 5 times.

612
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:26,709
There is no sign of any solution.

613
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,601
May be on talking once again.

614
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:30,145
Rather than telling Tam pi sir.

615
00:34:30,368 --> 00:34:32,314
You go and tell in the
back side of some buffaloes.

616
00:34:32,537 --> 00:34:35,484
On touching the sound,
at least it will move it tail.

617
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:36,776
Is he that much problematic?

618
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:49,196
Sir, I came asking for a small help?

619
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:53,664
Not possible.
For that, I didn't even ask.

620
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:58,329
If any one comes for help.
Always, I'll say not possible only.

621
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:02,173
I came to speak
about the orphanage.

622
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,541
Do you know the
value of that building?

623
00:35:04,735 --> 00:35:06,169
Sir, the rent, first you told.

624
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,478
It was given regularly, is it not?

625
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,552
Without any prior notice, if you
increase the rent like this?

626
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:15,157
It is my wish, increasing
or decreasing the rent.

627
00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:16,590
That is my prOPEITV-

628
00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:19,193
You don't have to
command anything.

629
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:20,862
Sir, this is also a service is it not?

630
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:23,856
What? Service?

631
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:27,132
To do the service,
am 'I running a trust?

632
00:35:27,225 --> 00:35:29,466
If you have that
much love, you pay the rent.

633
00:35:29,727 --> 00:35:30,865
Sir, please listen what I say.

634
00:35:31,195 --> 00:35:33,675
You don't say anything,
vacate the place.

635
00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:35,606
Sir, only one minute,
one minute only.

636
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:39,204
Must listen to what I say.
Okay, tell.

637
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:55,254
Looks like sirs
mood is not that good.

638
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:58,195
My bum and all are lying here only.

639
00:35:58,389 --> 00:36:00,130
Sir, you must come to our
orphanage, one day.

640
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:01,958
On seeing the happiness
of the children over there.

641
00:36:01,959 --> 00:36:04,337
In any man's mind,
there will be a smile.

642
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:06,199
I won't smile.

643
00:36:06,597 --> 00:36:08,406
That is because sir
is angry now, is it not?

644
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:11,537
Hey Man, always I won't smile.

645
00:36:11,702 --> 00:36:13,511
What should I do,
to change sifs mood?

646
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:14,804
Who is this fellow?

647
00:36:14,805 --> 00:36:16,751
Can't you understand anything?

648
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:18,249
I won't smile, man.

649
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:19,682
But still, is there people like this?

650
00:36:21,812 --> 00:36:25,885
4 to 5 years back, his son went
and married an outside caste girl.

651
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:28,423
After that, it is heard
that this tough nut attitude.

652
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:31,692
Both of them, had
not smiled after that.

653
00:36:31,923 --> 00:36:33,300
What's the issue in marrying?

654
00:36:33,491 --> 00:36:35,971
As there was only one,
was really lulled.

655
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,172
When son did
an inter-caste marriage,

656
00:36:37,261 --> 00:36:38,968
it was a big blow on their prestige.

657
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,234
On that mind frame, the
son was chucked out also.

658
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,709
Then?
Then what?

659
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:45,677
That boy and girl they
are living lavishly.

660
00:36:45,803 --> 00:36:48,784
They are here with a stiff face.

661
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:03,490
How can you see
these fellows for 2.5 hours?

662
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:06,759
Lot of fans to praise,
stupid fellows like this.

663
00:37:12,363 --> 00:37:12,864
Will you change this filth?
Don't change.

664
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:14,738
It's climax.

665
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:17,312
As the ban is still prevailing.

666
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:18,345
As the shooting is stopped.

667
00:37:18,502 --> 00:37:21,244
The actor Boomesh is in a situation.
Not being able to go back to Cochin.

668
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:23,842
The agitators against
the movies of Boomesh.

669
00:37:23,941 --> 00:37:25,818
The members of all
Kerala drunkards association.

670
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:27,650
The ones who had
come in support of Boomesh.

671
00:37:27,778 --> 00:37:29,018
The fans associations.

672
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:30,859
By this, they are
trapped in Thenmala.

673
00:37:31,015 --> 00:37:33,495
Just because of Boomesh,
drunkards like us...

674
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,393
...who are decently hailed.
Created a bad name on us.

675
00:37:35,553 --> 00:37:36,725
There is only one
way to remove that.

676
00:37:36,887 --> 00:37:39,299
In the next movie he
should act as a drunkard.

677
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:42,564
Like that, people like us should
be shown as decent fellows.

678
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:45,833
Can you explain it?
You are the President.

679
00:37:46,063 --> 00:37:48,805
That means, hero
getting really drunk.

680
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:51,675
Along with father and mother,
singing hardcore sentimental songs.

681
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:53,405
If the heroine is to love hero.

682
00:37:53,537 --> 00:37:55,244
Then the hero coming in
a drunken condition like this.

683
00:37:55,806 --> 00:37:56,876
The hero must say I love you.

684
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:59,453
There is lot of staring in that.

685
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:02,623
Who are these fellows to decide
which role brother Boomen should do?

686
00:38:02,713 --> 00:38:04,624
It is not necessary for brother
Boomen to hear what they say.

687
00:38:04,882 --> 00:38:07,055
Brother Boomen never used
to hear what the director says.

688
00:38:07,351 --> 00:38:08,887
Then, after all this drunkards.

689
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,436
Of lately there are no
reasons for strikes and all.

690
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:17,503
If I were there.
Within 5 minutes.

691
00:38:19,897 --> 00:38:21,638
All this issues would be solved.

692
00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:28,849
Buddy, has the
result of the test come?

693
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,951
No.
Told will inform on reaching.

694
00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:34,682
Do you have any
throat pain, itching?

695
00:38:34,845 --> 00:38:37,382
I just took that test for
a safety, that's all.

696
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:42,489
Lot of dust.

697
00:38:42,753 --> 00:38:43,891
Time has come to clean the room.

698
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,893
Okay then, shall I leave?
Man, little work is there man?

699
00:38:47,024 --> 00:38:47,866
Work, what work?

700
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:49,562
Came here on telling,
feeling bored by sitting there.

701
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,900
Now only thought, one
or two programs are there.

702
00:38:53,097 --> 00:38:54,098
I'll go and come.

703
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:55,876
Hey man, don't take the course.

704
00:38:56,033 --> 00:38:57,876
You are fleeing, due to the fear
you will catch dumb flu is it not?

705
00:38:58,102 --> 00:39:00,514
For that you don't have flu is it?

706
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:03,311
Only when I sneezed,
for you work and all emerged.

707
00:39:03,607 --> 00:39:05,086
Hey man, got work to do.

708
00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:11,726
Stop it man, stop coughing.
Stop it, don't sneeze.

709
00:39:23,794 --> 00:39:25,432
Hey man, this is not
a contagious disease.

710
00:39:25,596 --> 00:39:27,371
Through genes only, this is..

711
00:39:27,598 --> 00:39:28,838
Go man, go!

712
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:32,772
One filth, you say it as" Two man!

713
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:33,948
My ear will be faulty!

714
00:39:35,773 --> 00:39:36,581
Okay you sit here.

715
00:39:36,807 --> 00:39:38,445
I'll go and check
whether my result is ready.

716
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:39,986
On getting that, all your
doubt will be over, is it not?

717
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:46,656
What man?
Nothing sir.

718
00:39:55,526 --> 00:39:57,870
Satish.

719
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:06,480
Satish.
Present miss.

720
00:40:09,673 --> 00:40:12,745
Will call now for the test,
can wait here.

721
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:19,490
"Dear companion"

722
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:20,822
Can any of the duty doctors be met?

723
00:40:21,118 --> 00:40:23,098
Really busy, doesn't think
they can be met.

724
00:40:24,522 --> 00:40:25,830
If it's for tomorrow,
the appointment can be done.

725
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:31,095
Are you free?

726
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:32,635
I, was about to leave.

727
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:34,104
It was for me to ask a small doubt.

728
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:36,542
Come inside.

729
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,848
There is some difference
on doctor, than seen last time.

730
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:43,651
What difference?

731
00:40:43,808 --> 00:40:46,186
Nothing, have you
changed the frame of specs?

732
00:40:46,877 --> 00:40:48,049
This is new one.
This is very stylish.

733
00:40:48,212 --> 00:40:54,754
Really suits you.
Didn't ask the doubt.

734
00:40:55,052 --> 00:40:59,023
That is because, I'm a person who is
living with door to door sale and all.

735
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,225
Now on seeing any strangers.

736
00:41:00,558 --> 00:41:01,866
The house keepers
are closing the door.

737
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:03,697
On account of that no
business is taking place.

738
00:41:03,894 --> 00:41:05,532
Truly is this dumb fever contagious?

739
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:08,232
For that it is not known, whether
Aravind, has got the disease.

740
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:10,646
Then why thinking
about being contagious?

741
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:13,545
Still now it is not discovered through
the sneeze the disease is transmitted.

742
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:14,875
The research and all is going on.

743
00:41:15,072 --> 00:41:16,949
On saying all this will
the people understand all this?

744
00:41:17,074 --> 00:41:18,951
Half is blown up by these people.

745
00:41:19,076 --> 00:41:20,919
For few days this
fear and all will be there.

746
00:41:21,111 --> 00:41:22,089
After that it will be over.

747
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:33,258
Normally what everyone does is.

748
00:41:33,624 --> 00:41:34,568
On going out will wear the lens.

749
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:36,203
On going home that will be removed.

750
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,868
Why is it, other way round?

751
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:40,073
I don't like to wear lens.

752
00:41:40,264 --> 00:41:41,072
Glass is comfortable.

753
00:41:41,532 --> 00:41:42,772
Then why did you wear lens now?

754
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,071
That is because for some,
they don't like, I wearing glass.

755
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:46,270
That is for whom?

756
00:41:48,272 --> 00:41:50,912
Generally it is the girls
who are strict on boyfriends.

757
00:41:51,141 --> 00:41:52,586
Here is it the other way round?

758
00:41:53,577 --> 00:41:54,954
Here, no one is
standing and drawing.

759
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:59,756
I didn't mean that.
Just for a joke.

760
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:02,596
Anything else?
No.

761
00:42:02,786 --> 00:42:04,561
I must go now.

762
00:42:06,657 --> 00:42:11,657
MC Movie Channel

763
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:36,830
Are they lolly-pops?
Is it available even now?

764
00:42:37,121 --> 00:42:38,657
Not that easy to get, sister.
It is from the shop of my friend.

765
00:42:39,189 --> 00:42:41,635
His grandmother makes at home.

766
00:42:41,825 --> 00:42:43,634
Only old memories of olden
days having one, are there.

767
00:42:43,794 --> 00:42:44,966
Has been years on seeing.

768
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:47,209
Here.
No need, I just told causally.

769
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:49,074
No problem sister,
give one to daughter.

770
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:50,869
She might not have eaten all this.

771
00:42:51,835 --> 00:42:53,041
Here

772
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:22,976
Are there lolly-pops in here?

773
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:24,705
Lolly-pops, what are those?

774
00:43:24,969 --> 00:43:27,313
Lolly-pops, no one is
making them these days.

775
00:43:28,305 --> 00:43:29,215
What?
Lolly-pops?

776
00:43:29,373 --> 00:43:30,875
Daughter, that is
not seen in this country.

777
00:43:59,236 --> 00:44:01,807
"Let our friendship
also be as sweet like this"

778
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:22,895
Greetings. Today's main news.

779
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,231
Dumb flu may lead to death.

780
00:44:25,462 --> 00:44:27,874
It is a deadly disease
as reported by experts.

781
00:44:28,098 --> 00:44:30,806
For the patients chances
of losing their life or sound.

782
00:44:31,035 --> 00:44:33,413
May depend on
their preventive power.

783
00:44:33,804 --> 00:44:35,181
Which may be more or less.

784
00:44:35,272 --> 00:44:39,880
The experts are trying hard to
completely remove the disease.

785
00:44:40,077 --> 00:44:42,216
Not to worsen the
health condition of the victims.

786
00:44:42,413 --> 00:44:45,951
The medicine is made available
at preliminary health centers,

787
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:47,194
...hospitals and medical shops.

788
00:44:47,317 --> 00:44:50,161
Still now no one's death is
reported, affected with dumb flu.

789
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:52,027
If anything happens like that.

790
00:44:52,222 --> 00:44:55,032
That will be firstly informed
to you, by Prime T.V news only.

791
00:45:04,902 --> 00:45:07,212
Hey man, what you told is
completely forgotten.

792
00:45:07,438 --> 00:45:09,440
It is not 2 page
dialogue that is written, is it?

793
00:45:09,807 --> 00:45:10,444
To forget so fast.

794
00:45:10,808 --> 00:45:12,116
To say that much
dialogue, it's bit hard.

795
00:45:12,276 --> 00:45:13,914
Then shall I say simple 2 dialogues?

796
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:21,454
Then you go.

797
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:24,390
Hey man will the Indu, cheat?

798
00:45:24,788 --> 00:45:26,233
<i>That is Ciiandu.
This is ind...</i>

799
00:45:26,423 --> 00:45:27,231
Go boldly.

800
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:28,131
I'll be there outside.

801
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:34,226
MC Movie Channel

802
00:45:45,142 --> 00:45:48,954
Sadeesha, smiling,
has not forgotten.

803
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:53,360
What to say after writing the bill?

804
00:45:53,884 --> 00:45:56,831
My God, ruined!

805
00:46:00,324 --> 00:46:02,429
Say something and all man.

806
00:46:12,536 --> 00:46:14,482
No, can't hear anything.

807
00:46:17,207 --> 00:46:19,187
What man?
What happened?

808
00:46:21,478 --> 00:46:22,286
Stretch out the tongue.

809
00:46:22,813 --> 00:46:24,292
Has it spread from me, doctor'?

810
00:46:24,815 --> 00:46:26,055
So you are also
having this disease, is it?

811
00:46:26,316 --> 00:46:28,489
Still now not found
out it is contagious.

812
00:46:28,819 --> 00:46:30,457
To know whether you
have that disease also.

813
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:32,028
The result of the test should reach.

814
00:46:32,222 --> 00:46:33,792
Doctor is there any
way to find before that?

815
00:46:34,024 --> 00:46:36,504
Will know.
When the sound stops.

816
00:46:43,934 --> 00:46:46,881
To participate in the
discussion on dumb flu.

817
00:46:47,037 --> 00:46:49,039
Respected health
department minister.

818
00:46:49,206 --> 00:46:50,344
<i>Prabakaran Thachapuzha.</i>

819
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:54,320
Ex-minister and opposition
M.L.A. Thomas Kuzhiveli.

820
00:46:54,411 --> 00:46:55,981
They are both here
with us, over the telephone line.

821
00:46:56,113 --> 00:46:58,218
Greetings Prabakaran
Thachapuzha.

822
00:46:58,515 --> 00:47:00,222
Greetings, greetings.

823
00:47:01,084 --> 00:47:04,861
The actual checking of disease
is not happening at Thenmala.

824
00:47:05,088 --> 00:47:06,499
The actual news of
the disease is not obtained.

825
00:47:06,857 --> 00:47:07,961
Hiding from the people.

826
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:10,105
Like that several allegations
are coming up...

827
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:11,967
magainst the health department.

828
00:47:12,196 --> 00:47:14,073
How do you react
to these allegations?

829
00:47:14,364 --> 00:47:19,109
All that is simply told
and created by opposition.

830
00:47:19,403 --> 00:47:21,405
You go and see
that Thenmala hospital.

831
00:47:21,572 --> 00:47:24,109
People are flocking like anything.

832
00:47:24,408 --> 00:47:26,012
It is a huge response.

833
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:29,521
In such an irresponsible
way, can a minister talk?

834
00:47:29,646 --> 00:47:30,556
Who is ruling the state of Kerala?

835
00:47:30,914 --> 00:47:32,894
To conceal the clash in the ministry.

836
00:47:33,116 --> 00:47:36,962
I doubt this disease is
created by the ruling party itself.

837
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:39,167
Generally these kind of diseases,
only the central ministry...

838
00:47:39,456 --> 00:47:40,594
...is powered to launch all this.

839
00:47:40,958 --> 00:47:42,596
Thomachayan, has got
no knowledge on that.

840
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,200
The person who is
knowledgeable on that.

841
00:47:44,428 --> 00:47:45,600
Did you conduct an
awareness on that?

842
00:47:46,129 --> 00:47:47,972
Who told did not
conduct an awareness?

843
00:47:48,131 --> 00:47:49,508
2 times awareness was created.

844
00:47:49,967 --> 00:47:51,071
Even after telling,
when people are not listening.

845
00:47:51,268 --> 00:47:52,611
Then what to do?

846
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:55,348
Buy banana, can peel off the
skin and can put it in the mouth.

847
00:47:55,472 --> 00:47:57,179
But to swallow they
must intend is it not?

848
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:58,318
Did you hear?

849
00:47:58,475 --> 00:48:01,217
Is this a dialogue fit
for a minister in Kerala?

850
00:48:01,345 --> 00:48:03,484
Will a cultured person talk like this?

851
00:48:03,914 --> 00:48:06,986
Calling people banana swallowers!
Thachapuzha must resign.

852
00:48:07,184 --> 00:48:09,596
No, no I've not told like that.

853
00:48:09,953 --> 00:48:11,398
Making goat in to a dog.

854
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:13,125
This is the routine
practice of Kuzhiveli.

855
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:16,494
Go man! <i>I will</i> resign now.
Never, it will happen.

856
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,064
That is a good one.

857
00:48:18,328 --> 00:48:21,332
Sri. Prabakaran Thachapuzha, yet
there is an im portant another question.

858
00:48:21,598 --> 00:48:24,977
Still now the government has not
accepted dumb flu is contagious.

859
00:48:25,202 --> 00:48:27,307
Then why did the
health department distribute...

860
00:48:27,537 --> 00:48:29,380
mthousands of masks to the people?

861
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:33,188
That is because"
If at all if it were to spread.

862
00:48:33,343 --> 00:48:34,515
What would you do?

863
00:48:34,678 --> 00:48:37,352
Is it better to prevent the disease?

864
00:48:37,547 --> 00:48:39,493
Than after it's spread
and crying on it.

865
00:48:39,683 --> 00:48:42,357
I will tell the matter on that.

866
00:48:42,552 --> 00:48:43,997
On the pretext of that mask.

867
00:48:44,221 --> 00:48:46,360
Crores of rupees of
corruption has taken place.

868
00:48:46,556 --> 00:48:49,093
After collecting commission
from the mask manufactures.

869
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:51,432
Thachapuzha, has
conducted a masked robbery.

870
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:53,973
How do you react
Prabakaran Thachapuzha?

871
00:48:54,197 --> 00:48:56,108
On allegations made
by Thomas Kuzhiveli.

872
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:58,302
That is a big joke.

873
00:48:58,535 --> 00:49:01,539
Hallo, hallo.
Can't hear.

874
00:49:01,705 --> 00:49:05,346
Can't hear.
Hallo, don't leave him.

875
00:49:05,542 --> 00:49:06,680
Don't allow to escape.

876
00:49:07,077 --> 00:49:11,025
How will a minister rule the country?
On becoming confused when accused.

877
00:49:15,218 --> 00:49:16,356
Can't hear.

878
00:49:19,089 --> 00:49:20,932
Me resigning now, no way!

879
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:22,728
Will have to taste sour for that!

880
00:49:31,101 --> 00:49:32,375
"You go and see
that Thenmala hospital"

881
00:49:32,569 --> 00:49:34,378
"People are flocking like
anything. It is a huge response"

882
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:39,113
"It is a huge response"

883
00:49:41,378 --> 00:49:42,755
"His grandmother's camera"

884
00:49:55,258 --> 00:49:57,499
"Me resigning now, no way!"

885
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:59,140
"Will have to taste sour for that!"

886
00:50:13,443 --> 00:50:15,389
Why sir, standing up side down?

887
00:50:15,579 --> 00:50:17,616
On eating this 'bringo
di fringafath', it is said that...

888
00:50:17,814 --> 00:50:20,090
...good ideas will come to head.

889
00:50:20,217 --> 00:50:21,355
That is for people who
has got something in heads.

890
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:23,097
That is a good
'Aasanam',(yoga posture) sir.

891
00:50:23,286 --> 00:50:24,697
You have got the best
'aasanam'. Please get up.

892
00:50:26,123 --> 00:50:27,295
Really heavy!

893
00:50:28,558 --> 00:50:30,196
My sir, do you know one thing?

894
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:34,033
Like the month of 'kanni' dogs cry,
that is how the phone is ringing.

895
00:50:34,231 --> 00:50:35,608
I got fed up by answering.

896
00:50:35,832 --> 00:50:37,641
On tuning on T.V there is only sir.

897
00:50:37,801 --> 00:50:39,303
And in the net, there is
no need to mention.

898
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:42,275
With one interview
have I made an impact?

899
00:50:42,472 --> 00:50:44,713
Sir, not an impact..Calling father!

900
00:50:44,841 --> 00:50:47,117
On the face book,
youths are defaming.

901
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:50,291
Except that Prime T.V all other
channels are slightly in bad humor.

902
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:51,117
Why is that?

903
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:53,258
Because of sifs one interview.

904
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:55,761
The rating of Prime T.V
escalated to rocket height.

905
00:50:56,186 --> 00:50:58,359
It seems no one is watching
comedy programs.

906
00:50:58,655 --> 00:51:00,328
They are asking, to
other channels also.

907
00:51:00,524 --> 00:51:03,300
Can you say such
kinds of foolishness?

908
00:51:04,261 --> 00:51:05,706
Hey man, what is the
way to avoid un necessary...

909
00:51:05,862 --> 00:51:07,068
...things coming from the mouth?

910
00:51:08,131 --> 00:51:10,634
Like putting speed
locks for vehicles.

911
00:51:10,801 --> 00:51:12,803
Shall we put a lock in sir's mouth?

912
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:22,155
The dumb flu, that
is spread in Thenmala.

913
00:51:22,345 --> 00:51:24,689
Is taking a decisive turn now.

914
00:51:25,115 --> 00:51:27,459
This disease is
spread by H1 0, N1 0 viruses.

915
00:51:27,651 --> 00:51:31,531
The name which was termed as
'dumb flu' by health minister.

916
00:51:31,788 --> 00:51:34,735
Prabakaran Thachapuzha, is
now affected with this disease.

917
00:51:35,125 --> 00:51:37,731
It is found that ministefs
talking ability is fully lost.

918
00:51:38,128 --> 00:51:40,608
That is what is found from
the reliable sources now.

919
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:44,404
Move back.

920
00:51:44,634 --> 00:51:46,636
He is sick, move back.

921
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:56,853
Believed, believed,
all those fools were duped!

922
00:51:58,115 --> 00:52:00,186
Not that, did you stuff some
thing in that doctor's pocket?

923
00:52:00,417 --> 00:52:02,795
Not only in his pocket,
even inside his underwear...

924
00:52:03,153 --> 00:52:04,223
...lumps of notes are stuffed.

925
00:52:04,488 --> 00:52:07,264
That's enough, that's enough.
Can we trust him?

926
00:52:07,424 --> 00:52:08,732
Who? That fellow?

927
00:52:08,925 --> 00:52:11,804
If he says anything, will whack
even his deep rooted parts.

928
00:52:13,563 --> 00:52:16,703
Now there is no need to
convince anything to anyone.

929
00:52:17,501 --> 00:52:20,141
That is enough.
But still, sir's idea is astonishing.

930
00:52:20,437 --> 00:52:22,883
That is because this Thacha...

931
00:52:26,877 --> 00:52:27,912
It's C.M!

932
00:52:28,278 --> 00:52:29,916
No, tell I'm not here. I'm not here.

933
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:31,519
Okay sir.

934
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:32,855
Told to put it in the speaker phone.

935
00:52:35,252 --> 00:52:36,595
Sir, this is Sasi.

936
00:52:36,753 --> 00:52:37,561
Where has Thachapuzha, gone?

937
00:52:37,721 --> 00:52:41,760
Pachathuzha...Sir!
Machatha..He is here sir.

938
00:52:41,925 --> 00:52:43,131
Hey man, Thachapuzha!

939
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:45,340
He is hearing, continue talking.

940
00:52:45,529 --> 00:52:48,942
Can't talk, on opening the mouth
only air will come from the throat.

941
00:52:49,266 --> 00:52:51,906
Can't sit here, because of pressure
from media and opposition.

942
00:52:52,269 --> 00:52:52,747
What should I do?

943
00:52:52,903 --> 00:52:54,348
Sashi, what is that fellow doing?

944
00:52:54,538 --> 00:52:56,415
That is scratching his head, sir.

945
00:52:56,606 --> 00:52:58,586
Sir, telling to keep quite.

946
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:01,178
No, sir telling me to keep quite.

947
00:53:01,411 --> 00:53:02,719
Should I hand over
the responsibility of your...

948
00:53:02,913 --> 00:53:04,221
...portfolio to some else?

949
00:53:05,815 --> 00:53:07,886
Sir, showing bye, bye.

950
00:53:08,251 --> 00:53:09,195
What?
My heavens, sir, not that.

951
00:53:09,419 --> 00:53:10,921
Sir, showing no need, no need.

952
00:53:12,789 --> 00:53:15,702
Sir, one minute writing some
thing, let me check what it is.

953
00:53:16,793 --> 00:53:19,364
Not need to remove
from responsibilities.

954
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:21,372
It is said, I myself will handle that.

955
00:53:21,598 --> 00:53:24,943
Okay, okay, let me
study the situation.

956
00:53:25,302 --> 00:53:27,509
Tell, never step in to the channel.

957
00:53:27,804 --> 00:53:29,977
Though can't talk, he
will show actions with hand,

958
00:53:30,307 --> 00:53:31,752
...like Kadakali and all.

959
00:53:31,908 --> 00:53:33,581
Sir, he is showing.

960
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:35,790
No, not that coming
there to meet you sir.

961
00:53:35,979 --> 00:53:36,650
Sir, coming to meet you.

962
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:38,316
With the fever and
all don't come here.

963
00:53:38,481 --> 00:53:40,392
Till the sickness gets
over, let him sit there only.

964
00:53:41,518 --> 00:53:42,622
Okay sir.

965
00:53:53,997 --> 00:53:55,203
Is it Sree Devi Madam?

966
00:53:55,332 --> 00:53:55,776
Yes.

967
00:53:56,933 --> 00:53:59,743
This is Adityan's class teacher
speaking from Nirmalagiri school.

968
00:54:01,037 --> 00:54:03,711
Called to inform a
complaint about Adityan.

969
00:54:03,974 --> 00:54:05,647
Today while the
class was going on.

970
00:54:05,775 --> 00:54:07,652
He was sitting in the last
bench and playing video games.

971
00:54:07,944 --> 00:54:11,482
Video game? How did he get
the video game in the class?

972
00:54:11,648 --> 00:54:16,461
That is brought from the house. On
asking told, brought from home.

973
00:54:16,653 --> 00:54:18,655
If you don't attend
more in child's affairs.

974
00:54:18,888 --> 00:54:19,923
That will create un easiness for us.

975
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:23,833
Nothing like that will happen again.

976
00:54:24,494 --> 00:54:25,837
On reaching here,
immediately I'll ask.

977
00:54:26,463 --> 00:54:28,272
Adityan, is very
much distracted in the class.

978
00:54:28,465 --> 00:54:29,967
Always his attention
is somewhere else.

979
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:33,346
Will be problem if the
improvement is not shown.

980
00:54:36,873 --> 00:54:41,873
MC Movie Channel

981
00:55:43,606 --> 00:55:44,846
Why are you waiting here?

982
00:55:45,542 --> 00:55:46,418
Came to collect the result.

983
00:55:47,377 --> 00:55:48,720
For that can go to
the counter and ask.

984
00:55:49,446 --> 00:55:51,426
A fear.

985
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:52,789
Come.

986
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:56,963
Do you like that much to talk?

987
00:55:57,654 --> 00:55:58,724
I have not told, haven't I?

988
00:55:58,955 --> 00:56:00,935
My biggest ambition
is to become an R.J.

989
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:03,561
Even otherwise all this years
after saying what ever felt.

990
00:56:03,793 --> 00:56:05,636
All of a sudden can't talk, means.

991
00:56:05,795 --> 00:56:06,432
Can doctor be able to do that?

992
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:07,936
When people keeps
quite for some time.

993
00:56:08,064 --> 00:56:09,372
Half of the problem will be solved.

994
00:56:09,566 --> 00:56:11,637
They will remain peaceful,
attending their lobs.

995
00:56:13,403 --> 00:56:15,883
In life there are some problems.
Is it not true?

996
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:20,578
All this problems in the mind
can be solved by talking only.

997
00:56:20,944 --> 00:56:21,820
Can I ask one thing?

998
00:56:22,178 --> 00:56:24,749
What we think and talk,
is it not by using head?

999
00:56:24,948 --> 00:56:27,986
When the brain is remaining
silent there, which is taking...

1000
00:56:28,451 --> 00:56:30,795
...all the work of thinking. Why is
that our heart is beating there?

1001
00:56:31,154 --> 00:56:32,428
To pump blood.

1002
00:56:32,822 --> 00:56:35,393
No, that is talking to us non stop.

1003
00:56:35,558 --> 00:56:37,469
Only the thing no one
used to attend on that.

1004
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:38,638
Without listening to what brain says.

1005
00:56:38,795 --> 00:56:39,967
Just obey to what heart says.

1006
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:41,768
Then all our problems will be solved.

1007
00:56:59,949 --> 00:57:01,690
The result of the test is positive.

1008
00:57:06,689 --> 00:57:08,794
These are the medicines
which have to be taken daily.

1009
00:57:08,992 --> 00:57:10,596
They are for three weeks.

1010
00:57:11,027 --> 00:57:13,473
Then after every two day,
should come and take a injection.

1011
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:17,910
To completely cure the disease, it is
said that inventions are going on.

1012
00:57:18,668 --> 00:57:20,113
The researchers are
taking place on big scale.

1013
00:57:20,837 --> 00:57:24,512
Till then to control the virus
only this injection and tablet.

1014
00:57:24,841 --> 00:57:26,582
At any cost, it should
not be discontinued.

1015
00:57:32,749 --> 00:57:35,491
There is no big medicine greater
than self confidence for any disease.

1016
00:57:56,005 --> 00:57:57,211
Where are all this
things being taken?

1017
00:57:57,540 --> 00:57:58,848
That is..The expenses are going up.

1018
00:57:59,042 --> 00:58:00,851
Like before none
of the funds are coming, son.

1019
00:58:01,110 --> 00:58:02,987
Did that Tam pi Du rai
again create problem?

1020
00:58:04,113 --> 00:58:06,684
If you don't tell me.
Thought I won't know is it?

1021
00:58:09,285 --> 00:58:11,162
Other day, I went and
begged by catching his leg.

1022
00:58:11,521 --> 00:58:14,024
Who told you to talk to him?
Then what? Can't I talk?

1023
00:58:14,257 --> 00:58:15,861
Don't inform me anything.
If I give some money.

1024
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:16,902
Reluctance to accept it.

1025
00:58:17,026 --> 00:58:18,699
Hey fellow, aren't you doing,
more than what you can now?

1026
00:58:18,895 --> 00:58:19,498
If it was informed earlier,

1027
00:58:19,696 --> 00:58:20,731
I would have arranged some
money from somewhere.

1028
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:24,907
Hey boy! What is this?

1029
00:58:29,239 --> 00:58:30,513
What had happened to you?

1030
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:34,280
Because of this dumb flu,
sales are not happening also.

1031
00:58:34,978 --> 00:58:36,821
Othenlvise would have
found out some other way.

1032
00:58:37,046 --> 00:58:39,026
Is it because of your fault,
all this occurred?

1033
00:58:39,148 --> 00:58:41,219
Some things if we
try that will happen.

1034
00:58:41,618 --> 00:58:44,258
Some things how much we try,
that will go in it's own course.

1035
00:58:45,221 --> 00:58:46,894
How will we know which
will work and which will not work...

1036
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:48,535
...on trying?

1037
00:58:48,791 --> 00:58:50,896
Good, if it works or not.

1038
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:53,940
Should do only the
things that is right for the mind.

1039
00:58:54,297 --> 00:58:56,140
On doing like that, a kind of
pleasure is received is it not?

1040
00:58:56,633 --> 00:58:58,510
On gaining what so ever,
that will not be achieved.

1041
00:59:12,181 --> 00:59:14,991
There is no big medicine greater
than self confidence for any disease.

1042
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:35,242
You can call me to say anything.

1043
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:37,142
From inside it says Jai Hind.
On saying the name, it's Aravind.

1044
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:42,574
MC Movie Channel

1045
01:00:03,333 --> 01:00:04,573
Can't understand.

1046
01:00:11,908 --> 01:00:15,219
Is it to meet E.N.T specialist?
Come I'll show you.

1047
01:00:16,012 --> 01:00:17,923
This is the one.
Next time if you come here.

1048
01:00:18,081 --> 01:00:19,958
If you want any help, can meet me.

1049
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:21,857
The name is Indu.

1050
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:25,322
The name is Satish,
is it not? I remember that.

1051
01:00:25,922 --> 01:00:26,957
The other day on calling the name.

1052
01:00:27,156 --> 01:00:29,158
Like the school children,
haven't you told present miss?

1053
01:00:29,325 --> 01:00:30,895
Noticed at that time.

1054
01:00:36,866 --> 01:00:40,177
It is for the first time a
girl is talking to you, smilingly.

1055
01:00:41,004 --> 01:00:43,211
Generally, every one
will lure girls by talking.

1056
01:00:44,073 --> 01:00:45,882
Looks like when you keep quite
only, things will fall in it's place.

1057
01:00:46,776 --> 01:00:49,120
Looks like the thing is through.
Give the hand!

1058
01:01:07,397 --> 01:01:10,003
Since this fever has evolved,
the entire business is dull.

1059
01:01:10,767 --> 01:01:12,303
When going for a sale, no
one will open the door itself.

1060
01:01:13,436 --> 01:01:15,416
Because of that, now
telling the acquaintances.

1061
01:01:15,938 --> 01:01:17,212
If the business doesn't
crack, the salary will be cut.

1062
01:01:18,141 --> 01:01:20,678
If it doesn't trouble you,
can I come home?

1063
01:01:20,810 --> 01:01:22,756
On seeing the demo,
if you like it only buy it.

1064
01:01:22,912 --> 01:01:23,447
Otherwise no need.

1065
01:01:32,889 --> 01:01:35,028
Has gone out, who is it?

1066
01:01:35,925 --> 01:01:36,733
My name is Aravind, wanted to
show a demo of a product.

1067
01:01:36,959 --> 01:01:42,307
I was told to come.
Has not told anything.

1068
01:01:43,132 --> 01:01:45,976
Left little while ago.
Don't know when is the return.

1069
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:48,947
Madam, can I show the
demo of some products?

1070
01:01:49,105 --> 01:01:51,915
Only home based products
if you like it, only buy it.

1071
01:02:11,127 --> 01:02:13,129
Now there is cricket on T.V,
are you not seeing it?

1072
01:02:13,329 --> 01:02:16,970
Told, not to watch T.\/.
Why is that?

1073
01:02:17,467 --> 01:02:20,414
Due to less marks in the exam.
Failed in maths.

1074
01:02:23,506 --> 01:02:25,747
Why is all that note pad for?

1075
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:28,745
It is for customers to give
it as compliment.

1076
01:02:28,978 --> 01:02:30,048
Why? Do you want it?

1077
01:02:32,215 --> 01:02:34,354
How much?
All that, entirely.

1078
01:02:35,084 --> 01:02:37,223
Why? That much?
One trick is there.

1079
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:38,726
Will you tell mother'?

1080
01:02:39,055 --> 01:02:40,762
What will happen on telling mother?

1081
01:02:41,023 --> 01:02:43,799
That is all big problem.
Here comes Mother.

1082
01:02:56,305 --> 01:02:57,978
<i>Madam , is it you who is
the writer Sree Devi Menu“?</i>

1083
01:02:58,207 --> 01:02:59,379
Who has written
'Veenalaruthi'(end of summer)

1084
01:02:59,575 --> 01:03:00,519
...and 'Viralpaadukal'(Finger prints)

1085
01:03:00,843 --> 01:03:03,380
Yes.
I'm a big fan of madam.

1086
01:03:04,013 --> 01:03:05,117
I've read both the books.

1087
01:03:06,415 --> 01:03:07,553
How come madam
is not writing now?

1088
01:03:08,518 --> 01:03:10,361
That is..Because of busyness.

1089
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:13,061
When family and
children and all came.

1090
01:03:13,389 --> 01:03:15,528
Is it possible to manage everything?

1091
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:19,967
Then, the second book is
not that success, isn't it?

1092
01:03:21,164 --> 01:03:23,269
After that a fear to write.

1093
01:03:24,934 --> 01:03:27,175
The second book is
madam's master piece.

1094
01:03:27,403 --> 01:03:29,508
'Veenal Aruthi' has got
lot of awards and all.

1095
01:03:29,839 --> 01:03:31,045
I like 'Viralpaadukal'.

1096
01:03:31,374 --> 01:03:33,320
I know lot of people
who likes that novel.

1097
01:03:34,010 --> 01:03:35,887
Is it?
Yes, indeed.

1098
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:37,522
I'm not a veracious reader and all.

1099
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:40,451
Even if I'm waiting for madam's
next book to be published.

1100
01:03:40,883 --> 01:03:42,885
Then, no need to say the
case of good readers.

1101
01:03:43,085 --> 01:03:45,565
It's too bad to stop writing, telling
the issue of house hold works.

1102
01:03:46,255 --> 01:03:48,895
Some topics, thoughts are going on.

1103
01:03:49,125 --> 01:03:51,071
Madam, not just thinking
<i>at</i> any cost should write.

1104
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:54,571
If I had quarter of madam's talent.
I would have written ten novels now.

1105
01:03:57,533 --> 01:04:00,912
Sometimes I'm over talkative.

1106
01:04:01,637 --> 01:04:03,310
That is on meeting madam directly.

1107
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:06,953
Any way for the next work,
all the best in advance.

1108
01:04:07,443 --> 01:04:08,353
Shall I take leave?

1109
01:04:16,652 --> 01:04:17,460
Good person.

1110
01:04:17,653 --> 01:04:19,929
On telling me to come. And by
that time sculpted, is it not?

1111
01:04:21,958 --> 01:04:23,596
Sorry, doesn't recognize
who the person is?

1112
01:04:26,128 --> 01:04:28,540
Who is this?
Don't know Vinod.

1113
01:04:28,898 --> 01:04:30,434
But very familiar
have seen somewhere.

1114
01:04:30,933 --> 01:04:32,503
Can't really recollect.

1115
01:04:34,036 --> 01:04:36,539
I have come to the hospital.

1116
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:38,944
I'm in the business of door to door.

1117
01:04:39,642 --> 01:04:40,985
Madam, might have forgotten that.

1118
01:04:42,078 --> 01:04:44,490
Okay then, I came here
for a sale. Shall I go?

1119
01:04:58,527 --> 01:05:00,564
Welcome again to
the Prime T.V news.

1120
01:05:00,997 --> 01:05:03,671
Today, with us as chief
guest, it is none other than.

1121
01:05:04,233 --> 01:05:06,941
The fans who term him as world star.

1122
01:05:07,136 --> 01:05:08,979
Famous film star, it is Boomesh only.

1123
01:05:09,171 --> 01:05:13,517
Because of H1 0, N 10 virus,
a new disease is caught.

1124
01:05:13,676 --> 01:05:16,213
Dumb flu.

1125
01:05:16,612 --> 01:05:20,617
The disease that is
started in this Thenmala area.

1126
01:05:20,983 --> 01:05:22,894
All the efforts are started to
bury the disease in this area itself.

1127
01:05:23,085 --> 01:05:24,223
The efforts taken
n a speedy manner.

1128
01:05:24,553 --> 01:05:26,089
On the disease prevention
schemes undertaken...

1129
01:05:26,289 --> 01:05:27,529
...by the government.

1130
01:05:28,024 --> 01:05:31,631
I'm utilizing this situation to
congratulate the government.

1131
01:05:32,295 --> 01:05:35,401
Sri. Boomesh, before
ending one more last question.

1132
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:37,570
On your newly released movies.

1133
01:05:37,967 --> 01:05:39,571
Now the one on
which shooting is going on.

1134
01:05:39,969 --> 01:05:42,415
'If the attack hadn't come,
I would have died'

1135
01:05:42,571 --> 01:05:43,641
Against the so called movie.

1136
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:46,420
All Kerala Drunkard's association
is continuing the agitations.

1137
01:05:46,609 --> 01:05:52,059
How do you react on this?
About that nothing to say.

1138
01:05:52,281 --> 01:05:56,559
Do you have anything in
special to say on that?

1139
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:59,263
Nothing at all to say.

1140
01:05:59,455 --> 01:06:03,961
Family audience and fans
are waiting for your response.

1141
01:06:04,126 --> 01:06:05,730
I'm not responding.

1142
01:06:06,062 --> 01:06:09,509
Boomesh, who renders
punch dialogue on screen.

1143
01:06:09,632 --> 01:06:11,134
Does it mean that?
Boomesh in real life.

1144
01:06:11,233 --> 01:06:13,213
Has got less of reactions.

1145
01:06:13,569 --> 01:06:15,378
I don't have any thing
like that, lack of strength.

1146
01:06:16,405 --> 01:06:20,251
Boomesh, tomorrow if critiques say,
is a person without strength.

1147
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:22,352
How will you react to that?

1148
01:06:22,545 --> 01:06:25,185
If anyone howls on
seeing the moon rising.

1149
01:06:25,414 --> 01:06:27,416
Nothing will happen to the moon.

1150
01:06:28,617 --> 01:06:30,324
Did you get it?
Great! Broke the cot!

1151
01:06:31,253 --> 01:06:35,099
This is enough. To spice this, that
will be taken over by Prime T.\/.

1152
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:43,034
Son of a dog Boomesh.

1153
01:06:43,299 --> 01:06:47,213
The film star Boomesh, who gave
the punch reactions in the interview.

1154
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:49,581
The tumultuous ebbs of
that are seen on the streets.

1155
01:06:49,772 --> 01:06:51,012
More visuals on that.

1156
01:06:51,273 --> 01:06:53,219
Then what? He is a big moon.

1157
01:06:53,442 --> 01:06:55,319
Then who are the pariah
dogs? We men!

1158
01:06:55,511 --> 01:06:58,583
Without Boomesh, saying
sorry, nothing of sort will happen here.

1159
01:06:58,781 --> 01:07:01,455
Othenlvise Keralam,
will burn like this.

1160
01:07:02,051 --> 01:07:06,431
Son of a dog Boomesh,
we'll take you.

1161
01:07:17,299 --> 01:07:18,778
I know it was a big insult yesterday.

1162
01:07:19,335 --> 01:07:20,439
No, nothing like that.

1163
01:07:21,137 --> 01:07:23,139
If anyone who behaves
like that, it will be real pain.

1164
01:07:23,773 --> 01:07:25,116
Has got great dislike
towards me, is it not?

1165
01:07:25,608 --> 01:07:26,484
No, not at all.

1166
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:28,450
Then why not come to
me, to take the injection?

1167
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:36,426
I have not told anything
aboutAravind, to Vinod.

1168
01:07:37,319 --> 01:07:38,457
On saying all of a
sudden that is enough.

1169
01:07:38,687 --> 01:07:40,291
The guy is really possessive.

1170
01:07:41,323 --> 01:07:43,166
Then will have to explain
who Aravind is and all.

1171
01:07:43,392 --> 01:07:46,236
I used to avoid to the maximum,
those kind of situations.

1172
01:07:46,495 --> 01:07:47,565
That is why, yesterday like that.

1173
01:07:48,831 --> 01:07:52,108
If I ask a matter.
Don't get angry like other day.

1174
01:07:53,302 --> 01:07:54,610
He is slightly strict, is it not?

1175
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:57,483
Must not wear specs,
must not talk to boys.

1176
01:07:57,873 --> 01:07:59,250
Does Anjana's mother
know all this issues?

1177
01:07:59,542 --> 01:08:00,680
To mother'?

1178
01:08:01,811 --> 01:08:04,655
Yesterday, what Aravind
saw is my father's wife.

1179
01:08:05,548 --> 01:08:06,788
My mother was
dead in my childhood.

1180
01:08:08,384 --> 01:08:11,058
I didn't know that.

1181
01:08:14,323 --> 01:08:15,825
But still ifAnjana,
feels any sorrow, can't you...

1182
01:08:16,192 --> 01:08:17,432
...share it with Sree Devi madam?

1183
01:08:18,327 --> 01:08:18,828
It's mothefs position only, isn't it?

1184
01:08:19,395 --> 01:08:20,669
Why I don't know,
I couldn't see her like that.

1185
01:08:21,230 --> 01:08:22,868
I'm not that attached with her.

1186
01:08:33,375 --> 01:08:34,854
Haven't you seen this?

1187
01:08:35,444 --> 01:08:37,481
Small things are made
worse, by simply talking.

1188
01:08:38,447 --> 01:08:41,189
What will happen if two
groups say that to channel?

1189
01:08:41,650 --> 01:08:43,425
After all this days,
have they talked each other?

1190
01:08:43,819 --> 01:08:46,299
If I were there, would have
solved the problem simply.

1191
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:48,662
Why a ridiculing smile like that?

1192
01:08:48,891 --> 01:08:49,869
I told seriously.

1193
01:08:50,192 --> 01:08:51,899
Shall we bet?
What bet?

1194
01:08:52,761 --> 01:08:55,537
If I come solving this issue
between the fans and drunkards.

1195
01:08:55,764 --> 01:08:57,368
Will you agree?
What?

1196
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:59,307
By talking the
problems can be solved.

1197
01:09:04,907 --> 01:09:06,318
Not only agreeing.

1198
01:09:06,775 --> 01:09:09,517
Must talk openly to Sree
Devi madam and Vinod.

1199
01:09:09,778 --> 01:09:11,724
With talking should
remove the gap between you.

1200
01:09:14,483 --> 01:09:16,121
So,this is the dead line.

1201
01:09:17,953 --> 01:09:19,432
What ifAravind, fails?

1202
01:09:19,555 --> 01:09:21,364
What to do on failing, tell.

1203
01:09:21,757 --> 01:09:22,667
Shall I tell?

1204
01:09:23,225 --> 01:09:25,262
Should collect an autograph
signed on Boomesh's photo.

1205
01:09:25,628 --> 01:09:28,700
Too bad, how come
adoration like this?

1206
01:09:29,265 --> 01:09:30,903
What is wrong with
Boomesh. Isn't he real cute?

1207
01:09:31,767 --> 01:09:33,747
Cute? Holy cow!

1208
01:09:34,503 --> 01:09:36,176
Why? Can't I say my opinion.

1209
01:09:36,405 --> 01:09:37,247
That is true.

1210
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:39,881
But always should say
own opinion like this, openly.

1211
01:09:39,975 --> 01:09:40,680
Did you get it?

1212
01:09:40,943 --> 01:09:43,446
For example, Anjana, love
to wear the spectacle more...

1213
01:09:43,612 --> 01:09:43,885
...is it not?

1214
01:09:44,747 --> 01:09:46,727
So, say that opinion to Vinod openly.

1215
01:09:46,949 --> 01:09:49,190
Take off the lens.
Put the specs on the face.

1216
01:09:49,418 --> 01:09:50,726
Those are too small matters.

1217
01:09:50,953 --> 01:09:53,263
Many of the things what we
feel small, are big things only.

1218
01:09:54,323 --> 01:09:55,427
Come I'll show you.

1219
01:09:56,425 --> 01:09:57,495
Come on.

1220
01:10:01,630 --> 01:10:04,941
Look there.
This is the real Anjana.

1221
01:10:05,701 --> 01:10:07,612
Now remove that spectacle.

1222
01:10:08,971 --> 01:10:10,951
It's not real Anjana, is it?

1223
01:10:11,307 --> 01:10:12,615
Now remove that coat.

1224
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:16,913
If anyone says that this
doctor's coat is also awful.

1225
01:10:17,313 --> 01:10:18,314
Will Anjana, stop wearing this?

1226
01:10:18,581 --> 01:10:19,821
Now take a look.

1227
01:10:21,383 --> 01:10:23,385
This is for sure,
it is not the real Anjana.

1228
01:10:23,619 --> 01:10:26,964
For all individuals there are
certain specialties only for them.

1229
01:10:27,323 --> 01:10:28,529
That is the one, that
makes us, as we are.

1230
01:10:28,991 --> 01:10:31,403
When that is not there, we
will become someone else.

1231
01:10:37,566 --> 01:10:40,638
Make sure Anjana, is like Anjana.

1232
01:10:50,579 --> 01:10:55,579
MC Movie Channel

1233
01:11:19,842 --> 01:11:22,880
Why on pouring on to
yourthroat, you seem to"?

1234
01:11:23,045 --> 01:11:24,854
Put some pickles man.
Contem ptible fellow!

1235
01:11:26,882 --> 01:11:28,987
Brother, are you the union leader?

1236
01:11:34,690 --> 01:11:36,692
The president of
drunkards association.

1237
01:11:38,927 --> 01:11:40,838
My name is Aravind.

1238
01:11:44,733 --> 01:11:46,576
From where are you talking?

1239
01:11:47,036 --> 01:11:48,379
Sir, I'm from here.

1240
01:11:48,537 --> 01:11:50,073
Cut the phone fellow and call later.

1241
01:11:54,443 --> 01:11:55,717
Not fluent with English is it?

1242
01:11:56,845 --> 01:11:58,950
Brother, I came to
say an important matter.

1243
01:12:01,483 --> 01:12:02,723
You people, movies
of actor Boomesh...

1244
01:12:02,885 --> 01:12:04,865
Don't say a word on Boomesh!

1245
01:12:06,322 --> 01:12:07,995
What did he think
of drunkards, fellow?

1246
01:12:09,091 --> 01:12:10,502
That is what I was coming to say.

1247
01:12:10,893 --> 01:12:12,634
Let each one think
in their own terms.

1248
01:12:12,928 --> 01:12:14,669
Everyone should posses the
freedom to express the opinion.

1249
01:12:14,930 --> 01:12:17,103
On seeing a movie,
if you didn't like, don't see.

1250
01:12:17,599 --> 01:12:20,580
Since you don't like, stopping the
shooting. To ban the movie.

1251
01:12:20,769 --> 01:12:21,941
What kind of a logic is there?

1252
01:12:22,137 --> 01:12:23,582
Only if it is seen, the
com patriots can say.

1253
01:12:23,772 --> 01:12:27,743
Whether it is good or bad.
We'll ban the movie.

1254
01:12:27,910 --> 01:12:30,049
We will disturb the shooting.

1255
01:12:30,579 --> 01:12:32,490
Son of a dog Boomeshe!

1256
01:12:32,815 --> 01:12:38,959
MC Movie Channel

1257
01:12:39,455 --> 01:12:40,058
Stop it man!

1258
01:12:40,589 --> 01:12:42,569
Stopped, are you the police?

1259
01:12:43,759 --> 01:12:47,036
Brother, allow me to speak.
Tell brother, tell.

1260
01:12:53,035 --> 01:12:55,948
Brother, kindly pardon us.

1261
01:12:59,408 --> 01:13:01,649
Brother, opened our eyes.

1262
01:13:01,844 --> 01:13:05,951
Brother, don't cry.
No won't cry.

1263
01:13:06,849 --> 01:13:09,887
If you sign an agreement, saying you
have no problem with Boomesh.

1264
01:13:10,085 --> 01:13:10,859
It will be a great relief.

1265
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:13,727
Will sign and give anywhere.
Take brother, pen.

1266
01:13:16,792 --> 01:13:21,138
Brother, is it true or a dream?

1267
01:13:21,697 --> 01:13:23,836
It is their leaders sign,
that is lying length wise.

1268
01:13:24,933 --> 01:13:26,071
Hey fellows, all of come running.

1269
01:13:26,468 --> 01:13:27,378
Look at this.

1270
01:13:27,569 --> 01:13:28,604
How did you manage this?

1271
01:13:28,737 --> 01:13:31,081
Is there any problem that is not
solved. On talking directly, brother.

1272
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:32,851
Then our brother Boomen's movie
shooting can be started, is it not?

1273
01:13:33,041 --> 01:13:34,645
The shooting will take place
and the movie will also run.

1274
01:13:38,547 --> 01:13:39,821
We don't know how to say thanks.

1275
01:13:39,948 --> 01:13:41,484
Brother, which areas fans
club are you coming from?

1276
01:13:42,518 --> 01:13:45,499
Area, this area only.
Till now couldn't join the club.

1277
01:13:46,422 --> 01:13:47,560
Must join, will join.

1278
01:13:48,924 --> 01:13:50,426
You Boomesh.

1279
01:13:51,226 --> 01:13:53,433
We will drink by brewing you.

1280
01:13:55,431 --> 01:13:57,411
You dog, contem ptible fellow!

1281
01:13:57,866 --> 01:13:59,777
Then on saying strike, is withdrawn?

1282
01:14:00,836 --> 01:14:03,180
No idea.
One minute.

1283
01:14:03,672 --> 01:14:05,811
You dog, contem ptible fellow!

1284
01:14:07,242 --> 01:14:08,448
<i>Stop, $109-</i>

1285
01:14:09,077 --> 01:14:11,990
Brother, on saying the strike is
stopped and all, yesterday night.

1286
01:14:12,781 --> 01:14:14,226
What happened when it dawned?

1287
01:14:14,550 --> 01:14:16,154
Let me ask one thing.

1288
01:14:17,186 --> 01:14:18,722
Who are you?

1289
01:14:18,921 --> 01:14:21,424
I'm Aravind, haven't I come
to meet yesterday night?

1290
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:23,428
Fellows, did he come
to meet us yesterday?

1291
01:14:24,593 --> 01:14:26,971
Yesterday, till mid night
haven't I dried all the...

1292
01:14:27,129 --> 01:14:28,073
...water in my throat, you cheats?

1293
01:14:28,197 --> 01:14:29,198
When?

1294
01:14:29,965 --> 01:14:32,172
Then by hugging me don't
you remember, you cried?

1295
01:14:33,035 --> 01:14:35,140
Cried? Me?

1296
01:14:35,237 --> 01:14:37,217
The president is the person, who
doesn't cry when wife kicks on the chest.

1297
01:14:37,539 --> 01:14:38,916
President Salsa Kuttan.

1298
01:14:39,241 --> 01:14:40,845
Hey man, handsome boy.

1299
01:14:41,043 --> 01:14:44,923
We will take drinks
but the brain is absolute.

1300
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:48,591
Trying to fool drunkards, you rascal.

1301
01:14:48,784 --> 01:14:54,166
You fraud Boomesh.
Son of a dog Boomesh.

1302
01:15:00,762 --> 01:15:02,207
Leave it brother, it's okay.

1303
01:15:03,232 --> 01:15:05,269
When the intoxication got over,
they might have forgotten the case.

1304
01:15:05,767 --> 01:15:09,647
But any way this heart is there no, to
do this much for our brother Boomesh.

1305
01:15:09,771 --> 01:15:11,114
That we accept it.

1306
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:14,018
From this moment onwards
brother, you are included as

1307
01:15:14,209 --> 01:15:17,122
the special member in
Boomesh fans association.

1308
01:15:17,312 --> 01:15:18,757
Brother, no need that is okay.

1309
01:15:19,081 --> 01:15:21,823
Take this T- shirt and wear this.

1310
01:15:21,950 --> 01:15:22,826
No need.

1311
01:15:39,902 --> 01:15:42,041
Those who are
infected with disease.

1312
01:15:42,237 --> 01:15:44,740
Doctors and hospital staffs
who interact with patients.

1313
01:15:44,806 --> 01:15:46,683
There is a report
dumb flu affecting them.

1314
01:15:46,842 --> 01:15:50,654
As the research results bring shock
and fever among the people.

1315
01:15:50,846 --> 01:15:54,259
The information about the disease
is hidden by the government.

1316
01:15:54,616 --> 01:15:56,323
This is the report what the
Prime T.V has come to know.

1317
01:15:56,718 --> 01:15:59,255
Actually is dumb flu
contagious epidermic?

1318
01:15:59,354 --> 01:16:00,856
If so, how does it get infected?

1319
01:16:01,056 --> 01:16:03,935
Is the existing disease prevention
measures inadequate?

1320
01:16:04,126 --> 01:16:07,232
By hiding the answers to these
questions by the government.

1321
01:16:07,563 --> 01:16:09,304
An attempt to clear off the
apprehensions of the people.

1322
01:16:09,665 --> 01:16:11,008
Doesn't think it will
be fruitful from now on.

1323
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:13,236
Because with the
telecasting of this news bulletin.

1324
01:16:13,635 --> 01:16:16,639
Prime T.V is damn
sure the people will be panic.

1325
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:20,017
You simply don't
create a commotion.

1326
01:16:21,009 --> 01:16:21,987
Please just move back.

1327
01:16:22,811 --> 01:16:23,846
All of you just move back.

1328
01:16:24,046 --> 01:16:26,856
Don't jump like starved
children on seeing biriyani.

1329
01:16:27,149 --> 01:16:28,093
Other than health minister
to whom does one ask...

1330
01:16:28,283 --> 01:16:28,784
...about the disease?

1331
01:16:28,984 --> 01:16:30,657
My brother, just leave
the case being a minister.

1332
01:16:30,752 --> 01:16:31,958
Can't you give a consideration that
he is a being who cannot talk?

1333
01:16:32,220 --> 01:16:35,167
While asking just show the
sign whether it is true or false.

1334
01:16:35,357 --> 01:16:37,337
Sir, no chance, bad lunar
positions will really take its ride!

1335
01:16:37,659 --> 01:16:39,161
Sir, it is heard that
dumb flu is contagious?

1336
01:16:39,294 --> 01:16:42,639
How does it get affected
is it through air or food?

1337
01:16:43,732 --> 01:16:46,645
Vinod, shall we not meet
each other for few days?

1338
01:16:47,636 --> 01:16:50,583
Will take a small break
and re-think once again.

1339
01:16:51,139 --> 01:16:53,210
No, no that will be really straight.

1340
01:16:55,377 --> 01:16:57,584
Look, I have a matter to say.

1341
01:16:58,046 --> 01:17:00,151
Don't think disturbing you,
the moment you came.

1342
01:17:00,716 --> 01:17:03,026
For few days thought
of telling a matter"

1343
01:17:07,756 --> 01:17:11,636
Don't know how long
to go on with this play.

1344
01:17:13,895 --> 01:17:15,966
That thing started making the noise.

1345
01:17:16,798 --> 01:17:18,402
Hey fellow! Sasi,
phone is ringing man!

1346
01:17:18,734 --> 01:17:20,213
What to do sir?
Throw it out.

1347
01:17:21,103 --> 01:17:21,979
Hey fellow!

1348
01:17:24,072 --> 01:17:26,074
Who is it?
It's..C.M..Sir!

1349
01:17:27,109 --> 01:17:28,053
Yes sir.

1350
01:17:28,443 --> 01:17:30,423
Wants to say an important matter.

1351
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:34,122
The movie which has got a
controversial comment.

1352
01:17:34,383 --> 01:17:36,294
In the presence of the
controversial movies director.

1353
01:17:36,451 --> 01:17:38,124
To discuss and
decide on the matter.

1354
01:17:38,387 --> 01:17:40,060
That is what is
decided by the two groups.

1355
01:17:40,288 --> 01:17:41,767
The fate of brother
Boomen's movie is...

1356
01:17:41,957 --> 01:17:43,095
mpresently on our tongue's tip.

1357
01:17:43,291 --> 01:17:45,237
Those guys doesn't have any
common sense or brains.

1358
01:17:47,062 --> 01:17:48,439
Brother you also come along,
you may be required there.

1359
01:17:50,465 --> 01:17:52,638
Vinod, you are controlling me a lot.

1360
01:17:52,868 --> 01:17:53,846
Doesn't think that will be
fine from now onwards.

1361
01:17:56,672 --> 01:17:57,650
There is no chance to avoid going.

1362
01:17:59,274 --> 01:18:01,276
What happened Sree
Devi, is there any problem?

1363
01:18:03,111 --> 01:18:06,786
No, nothing, I was
thinking to tell one matter.

1364
01:18:06,982 --> 01:18:09,189
From all side there are severe
pressures, Thachapuzha.

1365
01:18:09,418 --> 01:18:12,365
In a situation like this, when the
health minister itself, can't talk.

1366
01:18:12,454 --> 01:18:13,228
What to do?

1367
01:18:13,388 --> 01:18:15,197
That will be a bad name for
party and the government.

1368
01:18:15,424 --> 01:18:18,234
Now, other than your resignation
there is no other way out.

1369
01:18:19,428 --> 01:18:21,874
My dear sir, don't
beat on the chest like this.

1370
01:18:21,997 --> 01:18:23,203
Even otherwise the heart is weak.

1371
01:18:23,398 --> 01:18:24,934
Not weak man, my case is gone!

1372
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:27,410
My sir, it is said that
when one way is closed.

1373
01:18:27,803 --> 01:18:29,009
9 other ways will open.
Then you open and show.

1374
01:18:29,137 --> 01:18:31,083
On putting the egg on ones chest.

1375
01:18:31,273 --> 01:18:32,684
It will turn to bulls-eye,
that is the situation.

1376
01:18:33,308 --> 01:18:35,720
Hey man, you call C.M on that thing.

1377
01:18:36,311 --> 01:18:39,952
And tell a medical
wonder has happened.

1378
01:18:40,182 --> 01:18:42,389
My talking ability was
regained, when sitting in the...

1379
01:18:42,484 --> 01:18:45,931
...toilet by morning.

1380
01:18:59,901 --> 01:19:01,209
From health research wing.

1381
01:19:01,770 --> 01:19:04,478
It is confirmed that
the dumb flu is contagious.

1382
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:06,786
Has send the report by fax.

1383
01:19:07,008 --> 01:19:11,115
Vinod, how to say
this? That..l don't...

1384
01:19:17,853 --> 01:19:19,127
Is itAravind?

1385
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:20,729
This is from orange F.M.

1386
01:19:20,922 --> 01:19:22,902
One vacancy on R.J has come up.

1387
01:19:23,091 --> 01:19:26,436
Okay sir.
Do one thing, that is not to forget.

1388
01:19:26,895 --> 01:19:29,239
Just glue a reminder note
on the side of the fridge.

1389
01:19:29,464 --> 01:19:30,465
Shall I go?

1390
01:19:31,133 --> 01:19:34,171
After continued
examinations and experiments.

1391
01:19:34,369 --> 01:19:37,043
It is confirmed, that
the dumb flu is contagious...

1392
01:19:37,305 --> 01:19:39,512
...from individuals to individuals.

1393
01:19:40,075 --> 01:19:43,887
Only through one thing,
the dumb flu will spread.

1394
01:19:44,079 --> 01:19:47,219
What is that thing?
Through talking.

1395
01:19:49,251 --> 01:19:50,161
Read

1396
01:19:50,852 --> 01:19:53,526
Not only that the disease
will get spread by talking.

1397
01:19:53,889 --> 01:19:55,232
Already those people
who are infected.

1398
01:19:55,390 --> 01:19:59,099
On talking more will create the
situation of the disease more complex.

1399
01:19:59,394 --> 01:20:02,068
Because of that, only way to
stop the disease spreading.

1400
01:20:02,197 --> 01:20:04,973
Is to introduce a ban.

1401
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:05,578
What, a ban?

1402
01:20:06,067 --> 01:20:08,343
The discussion that is scheduled
on tomorrow or day after tomorrow.

1403
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:12,008
Problems between the drunkard's
association and fan's association.

1404
01:20:12,207 --> 01:20:13,550
It is expected that it will be resolved.

1405
01:20:17,145 --> 01:20:19,591
What was it,
that you wanted to talk?

1406
01:20:20,015 --> 01:20:21,551
No nothing at all.

1407
01:20:21,983 --> 01:20:24,395
Come for the audition
just talk and go.

1408
01:20:25,353 --> 01:20:27,560
Okay sir, definitely.

1409
01:20:28,590 --> 01:20:30,934
Sasi, read man other
than goggling your eyes!

1410
01:20:31,326 --> 01:20:33,397
It is said to ban.
What?

1411
01:20:35,530 --> 01:20:36,565
Talking!

1412
01:20:37,332 --> 01:20:40,870
Sir, from now on, no
one should talk in this Thenmala.

1413
01:20:54,516 --> 01:20:55,586
'Talking injurious to health'

1414
01:20:56,017 --> 01:20:59,157
As the disease is
spread only by talking.

1415
01:20:59,354 --> 01:21:01,630
Till the medicine is
invented for dumb flu.

1416
01:21:01,957 --> 01:21:05,097
It is to be made sure
that no one is talking...

1417
01:21:05,227 --> 01:21:07,400
...in the region ofThenmala.

1418
01:21:11,132 --> 01:21:12,941
Did the nerve of the
laughter got snapped off?

1419
01:21:13,935 --> 01:21:16,848
Hey man, it is not
simply saying, God is there.

1420
01:21:17,072 --> 01:21:18,210
Hey man, when things
become like this.

1421
01:21:18,406 --> 01:21:20,044
Even the comm unist's
become believers.

1422
01:21:20,508 --> 01:21:22,488
Now, everyone's talking
is blocked, is it not?

1423
01:21:22,677 --> 01:21:25,317
Sir, for that is it laughing,
should cry, is it not?

1424
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:27,626
Hey fool!
If no one is able to talk.

1425
01:21:27,949 --> 01:21:32,056
Then why should I resign?
Now, on one will come to ask.

1426
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:34,166
And we can talk freely between us.

1427
01:21:34,322 --> 01:21:36,268
No, no we cannot talk.

1428
01:21:36,458 --> 01:21:38,335
The ban is meant for poor citizens.

1429
01:21:38,593 --> 01:21:40,038
That is not applicable to us.

1430
01:21:40,161 --> 01:21:42,107
Last month, when the commissioner
banned the speed of vehicle.

1431
01:21:42,330 --> 01:21:43,206
What happened?

1432
01:21:43,498 --> 01:21:45,478
The ministers are still
going in 100 speed, is it not?

1433
01:21:45,967 --> 01:21:47,446
Sir, that is, the police
knows who is the minister.

1434
01:21:47,569 --> 01:21:48,547
Who is the Panchayat
president and all.

1435
01:21:48,937 --> 01:21:50,473
But the dumb flu doesn't know that.

1436
01:21:50,939 --> 01:21:52,919
That is really a threat.

1437
01:21:53,141 --> 01:21:54,950
On keeping quite, the left over
sound will remain in the throat.

1438
01:21:55,143 --> 01:21:56,315
Then why are you
keeping, on talking?

1439
01:22:01,049 --> 01:22:02,653
It seems there is a curious virus.

1440
01:22:03,151 --> 01:22:07,065
One fine morning, the Kondoty
bus heading to the south.

1441
01:22:07,289 --> 01:22:08,666
Did this virus come in that bus?

1442
01:22:09,124 --> 01:22:10,330
From where did it come?

1443
01:22:10,659 --> 01:22:13,196
Is it from Uganda, or Ukraine?

1444
01:22:13,528 --> 01:22:17,271
If that virus had come
from any Konalk Place.

1445
01:22:17,699 --> 01:22:20,145
We are not going to remain salient.

1446
01:22:20,368 --> 01:22:23,645
Till this disgusting ban
is called back.

1447
01:22:24,039 --> 01:22:26,178
Our party members day and night.

1448
01:22:26,374 --> 01:22:29,287
Will keep on speaking in
front of the mike.

1449
01:22:30,712 --> 01:22:33,386
I'm asking.
Making me to ask.

1450
01:22:33,515 --> 01:22:35,188
Is there a constitution here?

1451
01:22:35,383 --> 01:22:38,057
Is there a governing system?
Is there a rule?

1452
01:22:38,386 --> 01:22:40,195
The ruling ones, you take it.

1453
01:22:40,388 --> 01:22:43,460
Till death, we will fi..Fi..Fight!

MC Movie Channel

1455
01:23:20,495 --> 01:23:24,466
The ex-minister, opposition M.L.A
Thomas Kuzhivelikunnil has expired.

1456
01:23:24,733 --> 01:23:26,974
Against the ban on
talking at Thenmala.

1457
01:23:27,202 --> 01:23:29,113
While inaugurating a relay
on talking strike.

1458
01:23:29,270 --> 01:23:30,544
As organized by the
members of the opposition.

1459
01:23:30,672 --> 01:23:32,083
While talking during the inauguration.

1460
01:23:32,273 --> 01:23:33,274
He died collapsing
during the function.

1461
01:23:33,608 --> 01:23:35,110
On getting enthusiastic
and on an empty stomach.

1462
01:23:35,276 --> 01:23:37,017
He talked the talking of two men.

1463
01:23:37,178 --> 01:23:38,486
That is the reason why.
Forgetting the dumb flu severe.

1464
01:23:38,713 --> 01:23:41,091
Instead of losing the ability to
talk, the life itself was lost.

1465
01:23:41,383 --> 01:23:43,522
This death was because
the tongue in the...

1466
01:23:43,651 --> 01:23:44,527
...mouth, never remained silent.

1467
01:23:44,686 --> 01:23:46,597
On seeing this the com patriots
at Thenmala, are really shocked.

1468
01:23:46,788 --> 01:23:48,768
Till the medicine is
invented for the disease.

1469
01:23:49,157 --> 01:23:50,795
Kindly cooperate without talking.

1470
01:23:51,126 --> 01:23:53,106
As requested by the district
collector, to the people.

1471
01:25:10,805 --> 01:25:12,409
"Till the next official
information is released..."

1472
01:25:12,574 --> 01:25:14,247
"...it will be in
definitely closed down"

1473

"The star is the drunkard"

1477
01:29:23,591 --> 01:29:26,868
Instead of written
official declarations.

1478
01:29:27,462 --> 01:29:30,966
With your constant request
on demand of face-to-face...

1479
01:29:31,466 --> 01:29:33,503
...interview with the health minister.

1480
01:29:33,868 --> 01:29:35,347
On that we have
gathered here today.

1481
01:29:37,538 --> 01:29:40,109
The questions from
media persons, are per-recorded.

1482

By pressing the switch of a
specially designed machine.

1483
01:29:43,611 --> 01:29:46,649
Only the minister will be answering.

1484
01:29:49,817 --> 01:29:53,094
It is due to the in-efficiency
of the health minister.

1485
01:29:53,588 --> 01:29:55,067
Making to spread the dumb flu
vigorously all over Thenmala.

1486
01:29:55,656 --> 01:29:59,399
Leading to ban the talking, a
criticism as leveled like that.

1487
01:29:59,660 --> 01:30:01,606
What do you have to say on that?

1488
01:30:03,030 --> 01:30:08,742
A good question.
The next question.

1489
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:15,184
How far is the research
going on, to invent...

1490
01:30:15,643 --> 01:30:16,553
...the medicine for the dumb flu?

1491
01:30:16,978 --> 01:30:19,686
Will this medicine bring back
the talking ability that is lost?

1492
01:30:20,014 --> 01:30:22,654
When will the ban on talking
at Thenmala, be withdrawn?

1493
01:30:23,751 --> 01:30:27,858
This government has taken
all the steps for that.

1494
01:30:28,523 --> 01:30:31,504
Till now, how many have
expired by affecting the dumb flu?

1495
01:30:31,859 --> 01:30:34,897
By next week, will the
num ber of dead exceed 100?

1496
01:30:36,864 --> 01:30:40,437
This government has
taken all the steps for that.

1497
01:30:40,802 --> 01:30:43,749

all the steps for that.

A medicine for the dumb
flu is invented.

1551
01:53:05,545 --> 01:53:06,990
The news are coming out like that.

1552
01:53:07,180 --> 01:53:09,387
In the lab of a famous
pharmaceutical company.

1553
01:53:09,516 --> 01:53:12,019
It is being prepared.

1554
01:53:12,185 --> 01:53:15,826
Only after solving the side
effects of the medicine.

1555
01:53:16,022 --> 01:53:18,195
It will be brought in the market.
That is what is known.

1556
01:55:33,092 --> 01:55:34,594
The job of thinking is
entirely done by brain...

1557
01:55:34,928 --> 01:55:36,066
...which is remaining there silently.

1558
01:55:36,229 --> 01:55:38,266
Then why is our heart
beating like this, here?

1559
01:55:40,233 --> 01:55:44,181
That is talking to us nonstop.
No one used to notice that.

1560
01:55:44,404 --> 01:55:45,508
Without listening to what brain says.

1561
01:55:45,672 --> 01:55:48,653
Listen to what heart says.
Then all our problems will be solved.

The preventive injection
and the nasal spray.

1574
01:59:24,557 --> 01:59:26,298
Will be made available
within two days.

1575

The health department
has launched a notice.

On the contrary, the
medicine to cure the disease.

1577

It is not fully free from side effects.

1578

That is the thing which
generates an apprehension.

1579
01:59:33,966 --> 01:59:36,412
Even though the medicine will
save the victims from the death.

1580
01:59:36,569 --> 01:59:39,778
The chances of losing the
sound 50% is remaining.

1581
01:59:39,972 --> 01:59:41,610
In those who use the medicine.

1582
01:59:41,741 --> 01:59:43,721
The priority is given to
stop the death.

1583
01:59:43,809 --> 01:59:45,254
Than stopping the loss of sound.

1584
01:59:45,411 --> 01:59:48,392
Maximum efforts will be done.
To make medicine reach to the people.

With talking we can
clarify the things to everyone.

1610
02:01:48,934 --> 02:01:55,351
When the sound is lost.
Never think that, what is in the mind.

1611
02:01:55,541 --> 02:01:58,488
Can never be expressed.
Without opening the mouth.

1612
02:01:58,611 --> 02:02:00,022
We can communicate.

1613
02:02:00,413 --> 02:02:01,414
Some times.

1614
02:02:01,681 --> 02:02:04,389
The things which cannot
be expressed on talking.

1615
02:02:04,583 --> 02:02:06,893
We can make them feel by actions.

Whether it will take place or not.

1617
02:03:55,194 --> 02:03:58,801
Should do the things which
are rig ht for the mind.

On doing like that, there is a
pleasure evolved, is it not?

1685

That will be known
only after waking up.

For using the nasal spray.
I welcome the respected Chief Minister.

On using this medicine,
for some people.

1700

There is a slight chance
of losing the sound.

1701
02:17:26,338 --> 02:17:30,514
But in the case
of our loving minister.

1702
02:17:30,642 --> 02:17:33,714
His sound is already
lost before itself.

1703
02:17:33,845 --> 02:17:35,483
Welcoming the minister
with great happiness.

1704
02:17:35,547 --> 02:17:38,892
To take the anti-viral injection.

1705
02:17:53,665 --> 02:17:55,611
Sister, is the cure medicine
taken for Aravind?

1706
02:17:55,700 --> 02:17:56,678
Given doctor.

1707
02:17:57,636 --> 02:18:00,708
My sound is regained.

1708
02:18:01,940 --> 02:18:06,940
MC Movie Channel

1709
02:18:38,576 --> 02:18:40,351
The issue of Boomesh is resolved.

1710
02:18:40,412 --> 02:18:43,484
As an un known youth has waved
a white cloth, as a peace sign.

1711
02:18:43,581 --> 02:18:45,492
Followed by that,
as peeling of the onion.

1712
02:18:45,583 --> 02:18:47,426
The problem was
solved with a second.

1713
02:18:47,585 --> 02:18:49,826
Drunkards association and
Boomesh fan's exchanging the kisses.

1714
02:18:49,921 --> 02:18:51,696
In to that scenes.

1715
02:18:55,360 --> 02:18:57,067
Who is that Grand ma?

1716
02:18:57,128 --> 02:19:01,599
That brother has united you with us.

1717
02:19:18,416 --> 02:19:21,920
Aravind, I failed in the bet, okay.

1718
02:19:22,887 --> 02:19:24,423
What Aravind, told is true.

1719
02:19:25,490 --> 02:19:27,663
When we say openly,
what is right in our minds.

1720
02:19:27,792 --> 02:19:29,772
All the problems will be solved.

1721
02:19:29,961 --> 02:19:33,738
The ability to talk is the biggest
strength, is it not what was believed...

1722
02:19:33,798 --> 02:19:35,402
...by Aravind all these years?

1723
02:19:37,102 --> 02:19:39,412
But the things that
is meant to be true.

1724
02:19:39,471 --> 02:19:41,473
The mind with no reluctance to do it.

1725
02:19:41,606 --> 02:19:44,951
That is Aravind's greatest strength.

1726
02:19:46,611 --> 02:19:49,922
All this years I
was hiding from myself.

1727
02:19:52,384 --> 02:19:55,388
It was Aravind,
who showed me that.

1728
02:19:57,655 --> 02:19:59,134
I want to hearAravind's voice.

1729
02:19:59,824 --> 02:20:02,031
Wants to hear it, an entire life time.

1730
02:20:13,938 --> 02:20:14,780
What happened?

1731
02:20:16,708 --> 02:20:17,186
What?

1732
02:20:22,447 --> 02:20:23,926
It has been long time
since talked, is it not?

1733
02:20:26,151 --> 02:20:26,925
Lost the touch.

1734
02:20:38,062 --> 02:20:39,200
We come to know how beautiful.

1735
02:20:39,531 --> 02:20:41,010
The sound of life is,
only when the silence comes.

1736
02:20:41,099 --> 02:20:44,774
Where ever in the world, to who
ever, must say what is meant to say.

1737
02:20:48,473 --> 02:20:50,646
Your sound, your heart is talking.

1738
02:20:53,711 --> 02:20:54,917
What is happening sir?

1739
02:20:57,248 --> 02:21:02,095
Sir, tell something.
Sir, open the mouth and talk.

1740
02:21:03,621 --> 02:21:06,158
Let it come out sir, take
the breath from the navel.

1741
02:21:06,257 --> 02:21:09,466
And try talking.
Is it gone?

1742
02:21:10,962 --> 02:21:12,032
Really gone.

1743
02:21:14,732 --> 02:21:17,804
Then in that case, can the
resignation letter be prepared?

1744
02:21:18,536 --> 02:21:25,750
"With in inside on the river
Like the rain drops"

1745
02:21:25,877 --> 02:21:33,091
"Someone is singing in the ears
Talking to me every day"

1746
02:21:33,251 --> 02:21:40,726
"Jasmine, more beautiful than you
On the lips that flowers a smile"

1747
02:21:40,859 --> 02:21:48,141
"I'm hearing that tune
I'm also singing along"

1748
02:21:48,266 --> 02:21:55,241
"Will forget everything
Will put the wings and fly"

1749
02:21:55,607 --> 02:22:03,150
"Will galore in the eyes
Will fill the dreams"

1750
02:22:33,111 --> 02:22:35,113
"The drunkard is the star"
