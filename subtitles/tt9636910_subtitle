1
00:10:20,489 --> 00:10:22,030
You come from different places

2
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:25,864
You should come, study and leave

3
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:31,572
Apart from that, if you assault
our culture, heritage and women

4
00:10:36,905 --> 00:10:37,489
Sir

5
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:43,030
Actually, I was sitting
with my boy friend

6
00:10:43,405 --> 00:10:44,489
Seeing them attack

7
00:10:45,155 --> 00:10:45,989
He ran away

8
00:10:46,155 --> 00:10:47,614
If you had not come
they would have

9
00:10:48,697 --> 00:10:50,322
I made a mistake by falling in love
with this kind of a person

10
00:10:50,947 --> 00:10:51,780
Not only you

11
00:10:52,572 --> 00:10:54,489
We Indians are number one
in getting cheated

12
00:10:55,114 --> 00:10:58,614
They make a mistake in electing
their leaders while voting

13
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:01,822
Our youths fail in choosing a suitable
career at the right time

14
00:11:02,239 --> 00:11:03,155
And you girls

15
00:11:03,947 --> 00:11:05,780
You are getting cheated
in the name of love

16
00:11:06,197 --> 00:11:07,280
I will tell you one truth

17
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,447
As long as there are
innocents in the world

18
00:11:09,947 --> 00:11:10,905
Cheaters will exist

19
00:11:11,072 --> 00:11:11,655
Keep this in mind

20
00:11:12,364 --> 00:11:14,072
This is not your problem
This is your problem

21
00:11:14,614 --> 00:11:16,239
In this age you feel love is great

22
00:11:16,739 --> 00:11:19,447
Gradually you will realise
it is life which is great

23
00:11:21,905 --> 00:11:24,614
Majority of the girls run away for love

24
00:11:25,697 --> 00:11:26,447
For the first time

25
00:11:27,822 --> 00:11:29,322
You should run for your life

26
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:40,072
Seeing the speed in which
the girl is running

27
00:11:40,905 --> 00:11:42,489
Seems like she will never
get cheated in her life again

28
00:11:43,697 --> 00:11:45,822
I dash it

29
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,030
You always said
I like it, I like it

30
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:52,697
Now you are saying “I dash it”
What do you mean by that Sir?

31
00:11:53,989 --> 00:11:55,114
People are intelligent

32
00:11:55,447 --> 00:11:57,405
They will fill it up with
whatever they want

33
00:12:00,072 --> 00:12:01,947
Oh Rajendra, what’s the matter?

34
00:12:02,197 --> 00:12:03,780
There is a party at 7.30
in the evening

35
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:04,780
You should come without fail

36
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:05,364
Don’t worry

37
00:12:05,822 --> 00:12:08,239
Exactly at 7.30
I will be there, okay?

38
00:12:15,739 --> 00:12:18,405
Hi, hello
Hi

39
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:21,072
What’s the occasion
for this surprise party?

40
00:12:21,197 --> 00:12:22,989
I got independence today

41
00:12:24,114 --> 00:12:24,947
I mean

42
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:27,280
I got divorced from my wife

43
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:30,197
What? You got divorce
from your wife?!

44
00:12:30,572 --> 00:12:30,989
Yes

45
00:12:31,322 --> 00:12:35,072
Instead of living a non updated brute

46
00:12:35,614 --> 00:12:39,697
Jimmy whom I loved to the core
in my college days

47
00:12:40,197 --> 00:12:44,239
I’ve decided to enter
live in together with her

48
00:12:44,239 --> 00:12:45,572
What about the child?

49
00:12:45,947 --> 00:12:47,280
I will admit it in
a residential school

50
00:12:47,322 --> 00:12:49,697
You expect us to celebrate
your family break up?!

51
00:12:49,739 --> 00:12:52,364
You should not cheat your family
in the name of enjoyment

52
00:12:52,655 --> 00:12:53,364
Look at Santhosh

53
00:12:53,697 --> 00:12:54,989
He failed in love but
he succeeded in life

54
00:12:57,155 --> 00:12:59,197
Is he not happy with the lady
chosen by his father?

55
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:02,780
When you don’t get
the one you love

56
00:13:03,322 --> 00:13:04,489
What is the use of having anything?

57
00:13:05,239 --> 00:13:06,322
You ask Santhosh for instance

58
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,822
Santhosh, are you happy with your life?

59
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,322
Santhosh, are you happy
with your life?

60
00:13:17,572 --> 00:13:18,530
Hey what man!

61
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:20,239
You guys continue the party

62
00:13:20,447 --> 00:13:21,447
Hey Santhosh

63
00:13:21,739 --> 00:13:23,947
Hey Santhosh stop
Listen to me Santhosh

64
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:42,322
My son

65
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,364
When you were a kid

66
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:47,989
I have bought you all that you asked for

67
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:49,905
Just because you didn’t get a girl

68
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:51,905
You are suffering now

69
00:13:53,197 --> 00:13:56,030
I can’t buy you that girl, my son

70
00:13:57,114 --> 00:13:57,447
Look

71
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,280
Marry Ramanna’s daughter Gowri

72
00:14:01,905 --> 00:14:03,614
This is your father’s last wish

73
00:14:05,239 --> 00:14:08,364
"This is a sacred thread
This is essential for my long life"

74
00:14:28,822 --> 00:14:29,822
Dinner is ready

75
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:33,822
I am not hungry

76
00:14:35,614 --> 00:14:36,322
You have and sleep

77
00:15:48,655 --> 00:15:51,239
Did you finalize the heli taxi agreement
with the Russian company?

78
00:15:51,864 --> 00:15:52,947
Yes Sir its ready

79
00:15:53,655 --> 00:15:54,947
Okay, mail me one copy
I'll go through it

80
00:15:55,322 --> 00:15:56,405
Okay?

That is upma, puri

83
00:16:23,572 --> 00:16:24,614
Vada pulav

84
00:16:25,447 --> 00:16:26,239
Everything is ready

85
00:16:27,489 --> 00:16:29,572
Cornflakes!
Cornflakes?

86
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:31,655
Yes, it is ready

87
00:16:32,197 --> 00:16:34,655
Just minute, get me cut fruits

88
00:16:36,905 --> 00:16:37,489
Yes it’s ready

89
00:16:50,405 --> 00:16:51,530
Pappa
That's okay

90
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,114
Yeah, Just a minute
What is it?

91
00:16:54,405 --> 00:16:57,114
You drop me to school today, papa

92
00:16:57,989 --> 00:16:59,239
I am getting late for my office

93
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:02,072
It is Ramanna who drops you
to school everyday right?

94
00:17:02,905 --> 00:17:04,989
Gowri!
Yeah, I will call you back

95
00:17:06,655 --> 00:17:07,072
What?!

96
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:10,072
She asking me to drop her to school
when I am leaving to office

97
00:17:10,322 --> 00:17:11,364
Is this what you have taught her?

98
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:14,155
Papa, do not scold mom

99
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:16,655
I will go with driver uncle to school

100
00:17:16,947 --> 00:17:18,114
Okay then go

00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,072
Yeah tell me

00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:23,822
I will come there and talk
Okay

103
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,405
'Why are you not replying me?'

104
00:18:12,072 --> 00:18:14,530
‘Don’t you have minimum
sense to revert back?’

105
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,530
Obviously, I am not your wife...
Someone very dear to you..

106
00:18:29,739 --> 00:18:32,864
Hey freak! Bug got into your head?
Okay guess me darling

107
00:18:50,449 --> 00:18:50,741
Keep it there

108
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:54,366
Who are you?

109
00:19:05,824 --> 00:19:07,199
Wow! Sexy!

110
00:19:08,074 --> 00:19:08,658
Santhosh

111
00:19:09,241 --> 00:19:10,491
She’s quite a brilliant person!

112
00:19:10,866 --> 00:19:12,991
Since you are a millionaire
I think she is trying to trap you

113
00:19:13,533 --> 00:19:14,616
Do not worry about all this

114
00:19:14,949 --> 00:19:15,824
Block this number

115
00:19:16,116 --> 00:19:18,449
Is she torturing so much?
Give me her number

116
00:19:20,699 --> 00:19:21,574
It is a Mumbai’s number

117
00:19:22,533 --> 00:19:23,824
Aunty’s name is Deepu

118
00:19:25,491 --> 00:19:26,449
Hey, aunty’s phone is ringing

119
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:28,616
Tell me Maalinga

120
00:19:30,158 --> 00:19:31,616
How do you know my name?

121
00:19:31,824 --> 00:19:33,199
Hey bloody idiot

122
00:19:33,616 --> 00:19:36,616
True caller shows your name
You dumb fellow!

123
00:19:36,783 --> 00:19:38,033
Hey, leave it

124
00:19:38,658 --> 00:19:41,074
I am not Sri Lankan bowler Malinga

125
00:19:41,324 --> 00:19:42,699
A Hassan Gowda

126
00:19:42,908 --> 00:19:44,199
Mahalinga!

127
00:19:45,783 --> 00:19:47,033
Oh! You are from Hassan!

128
00:19:47,283 --> 00:19:51,658
You are not fit for bowling
You are fit for batting!

129
00:19:52,158 --> 00:19:54,408
May I know who you are?

130
00:19:54,658 --> 00:19:55,908

Hello

135
00:20:06,408 --> 00:20:07,908
She cut the call

136
00:20:09,033 --> 00:20:12,116
You forget your age and position
when it comes to women

137
00:20:15,199 --> 00:20:16,241
Hello

Cumbala hills, Mumbai 26
Maharashtra

00:20:41,658 --> 00:20:42,866
Madam this is Ambani’s house

00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,991
Yes, I am his daughter-in-law

00:20:45,158 --> 00:20:45,408

153
00:20:46,074 --> 00:20:47,533
She is saying
she is Ambani’s daughter-in-law

154
00:20:47,824 --> 00:20:48,574
Go to hell!

155
00:20:49,533 --> 00:20:51,324
The one who spoke to you
was not Shilpa Shetty

156
00:20:51,533 --> 00:20:53,158
And the one who spoke to him
was not Ambani’s daughter-in-law

157
00:20:53,324 --> 00:20:54,116
What is this Santhosh?

158
00:20:54,408 --> 00:20:56,658
You are tensed for
one WhatsApp message?

159
00:21:13,199 --> 00:21:14,074
Hi Santhosh

160
00:21:14,741 --> 00:21:15,324
I am sorry dude

I troubled you a lot
while chatting

00:21:19,658 --> 00:21:21,991
You couldn’t recognise me?

163
00:21:25,949 --> 00:21:26,866
It is me

167
00:22:16,116 --> 00:22:17,116
Are you having a headache?

168
00:22:19,366 --> 00:22:20,408
Shall I give you oil massage?

169
00:22:21,158 --> 00:22:22,699
No need, you go to sleep

170
00:22:28,449 --> 00:22:31,116
Sorry, I troubled you a lot

171
00:22:31,658 --> 00:22:32,824

O time, you are not ten twenty
You are four twenty

175
00:22:48,866 --> 00:22:50,908
You are nagging too much
to pass ten minutes

176
00:22:51,033 --> 00:22:53,033
You move fast when you want

177
00:22:53,116 --> 00:22:55,033
But you move slow when I want

178
00:22:58,741 --> 00:23:00,074

I am waiting for an important call

185
00:23:18,699 --> 00:23:19,158
Cut the call now

186
00:23:38,533 --> 00:23:39,199
Hi Santhu

187
00:23:40,116 --> 00:23:40,658
How are you?

188
00:23:44,324 --> 00:23:45,324
I am doing good Dharmika

189
00:23:47,991 --> 00:23:50,074
How are you Dharmika?
Where are you now?

190
00:23:50,783 --> 00:23:52,741
I am settled in Mumbai now

191
00:23:53,866 --> 00:23:57,408
Santhu, your friend Prabhakar
had come to Mumbai recently

192
00:23:57,991 --> 00:23:59,449
He told me everything about you

193
00:23:59,949 --> 00:24:00,699
Not only that

194
00:24:01,491 --> 00:24:03,491
I recently read about you
in a magazine

195
00:24:04,574 --> 00:24:09,991
An ordinary boy who was behind me
obsessed with love

196
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:13,783
Is now grown up to be
recognised by Google

197
00:24:14,449 --> 00:24:16,033
I really felt very happy

198
00:24:16,783 --> 00:24:18,158
I am really very proud of you

199
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:22,949
Dharmika, a sculptor is needed
for a stone to become an idol

200
00:24:24,949 --> 00:24:26,866
If a boy has to come up in life

201
00:24:28,241 --> 00:24:29,783
A girl like you should be behind him

202
00:24:31,533 --> 00:24:37,241
Men don’t forget the beloved
though you get married and have kids!

203
00:24:39,033 --> 00:24:41,033
It is girls who love and forget easily

204
00:24:43,074 --> 00:24:43,949
Men are not like that

205
00:24:46,533 --> 00:24:49,366
We build a temple in the heart
and worship you

206
00:24:50,074 --> 00:24:50,699
Life long

207
00:24:50,991 --> 00:24:53,324
Yes, men are great!

208
00:24:54,908 --> 00:24:56,658
The reason why I called you now is

209
00:24:57,783 --> 00:25:00,491
I am coming to Bangalore this Friday

210
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:01,991
Will you meet me?

211
00:25:02,658 --> 00:25:05,116
What? You are coming
to Bangalore?

212
00:25:06,324 --> 00:25:10,491
Dharmika, I will be waiting for
that day from this very moment

213
00:25:12,574 --> 00:25:14,741
Okay, I will see you soon Santhu

214
00:25:15,574 --> 00:25:17,283
Take care
Bye

215
00:25:33,783 --> 00:25:40,783
From long time
I am behind you

216
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:41,199
hugging me softly

217
00:27:41,658 --> 00:27:44,491
She said everything is yours now

218
00:27:45,283 --> 00:27:52,491
Your name has become a sweet tune
In every beat of my heart

219
00:27:52,824 --> 00:27:56,033
I am a new lost Romeo

220
00:27:56,783 --> 00:28:00,074
I roam around to
become part of you

221
00:28:02,824 --> 00:28:09,533
From long time, I am behind you

222
00:28:10,366 --> 00:28:13,949
I am a master because of you
My sir name is Super star

223
00:28:14,241 --> 00:28:17,533
I got looted in your love

224
00:28:18,033 --> 00:28:21,533
It will end when I say No
Trend will be set when I say Start

225
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:25,116
I got bent by your touch

226
00:28:26,033 --> 00:28:30,324
Love me forever

227
00:28:33,741 --> 00:28:38,241
Without asking why

228
00:28:41,449 --> 00:28:48,824
While saying 1.. 2.. 3..4
When music play

229
00:28:49,199 --> 00:28:52,658
I got knocked out little early

230
00:28:56,949 --> 00:29:04,366
You like Insta
Take a selfie of the heart now

231
00:29:04,658 --> 00:29:08,283
Upload it soon

232
00:29:22,491 --> 00:29:23,741
She is coming back?

233
00:29:27,824 --> 00:29:31,699
when you went behind her and
asked her to love you in college days

234
00:29:31,949 --> 00:29:33,241
She didn’t give a damn

235
00:29:33,366 --> 00:29:36,408
Now she is coming back
And you want to meet her!

236
00:29:37,033 --> 00:29:37,324
Dude

237
00:29:37,866 --> 00:29:39,283
Girls are all opportunists

238
00:29:39,699 --> 00:29:41,658
She dumped you for your status

239
00:29:41,991 --> 00:29:43,408
Now she is coming back

240
00:29:43,741 --> 00:29:45,033
The reason for that is your richness

241
00:29:45,866 --> 00:29:47,783
Santhu, listen to me

242
00:29:48,616 --> 00:29:51,741
She is the one who made you
to attempt suicide

243
00:29:52,241 --> 00:29:56,741
When herself is coming here
Finish the matter tomorrow

244
00:30:04,658 --> 00:30:08,658
I am meeting someone whom I love
after a very long time

245
00:30:09,783 --> 00:30:12,366
I must become ten years young

246
00:30:17,074 --> 00:30:20,116
Mom, a super hero has
come to our house

247
00:30:20,533 --> 00:30:21,824
A super hero?!

248
00:30:41,116 --> 00:30:41,366
Look

249
00:30:43,533 --> 00:30:46,116
Next two three days

250
00:30:46,616 --> 00:30:47,658
I will be in that mood

251
00:30:47,783 --> 00:30:48,533
Do not come in between and ask

252
00:30:48,658 --> 00:30:52,074
If I need pickle, cucumber

253
00:30:52,366 --> 00:30:53,699
Shall I get you juice
Shall I give you milk

00:30:54,658 --> 00:30:56,074
Shall I massage your head with oil

255
00:30:56,449 --> 00:30:58,741
I don’t want such
unnecessary entries, okay?

256
00:31:03,241 --> 00:31:06,116
You pony!
Is good

257
00:31:22,199 --> 00:31:22,574
Yes Sir

258
00:31:22,991 --> 00:31:24,366
Can you show me
a good diamond ring?

259
00:31:26,324 --> 00:31:27,783
No no not these

260
00:31:28,324 --> 00:31:30,033
Show me some exclusive solitaire ring

261
00:31:34,241 --> 00:31:37,033
It is compared to Kohinoor diamond Sir
Equally good Sir

262
00:31:39,074 --> 00:31:39,449
Beautiful!

263
00:31:40,199 --> 00:31:42,449
Our boss bid this in London
and brought it

264
00:31:52,449 --> 00:31:53,283
Is this for your wife Sir?

265
00:31:53,991 --> 00:31:58,616
I am presenting this to
the one who is priceless

266
00:31:59,116 --> 00:32:01,783
It costs around 4.5 Cr Sir

267
00:32:02,449 --> 00:32:04,033
Pack it
Sure Sir

268
00:32:19,824 --> 00:32:20,074

She is from country side

285
00:33:01,283 --> 00:33:03,116
I married her for my father compulsion

286
00:33:03,741 --> 00:33:04,199

I am going out on an important work

307
00:34:15,241 --> 00:34:16,491
She is asking me where I am going

308
00:34:16,783 --> 00:34:17,741
Is this what you have taught her?

309
00:34:18,324 --> 00:34:19,241
You are the one who is spoiling her

310
00:34:19,699 --> 00:34:21,991
Okay leave it
Do not scold mom

311
00:34:22,158 --> 00:34:23,824

I am going out now

313
00:34:32,783 --> 00:34:33,366
Listen

314
00:34:40,283 --> 00:34:42,241
I think you bought this
to present to someone

315
00:34:43,158 --> 00:34:44,408
You forgot to take it

316
00:35:24,092 --> 00:35:27,801
This is the pitch which
I set for today’s match

317
00:35:28,342 --> 00:35:28,759
Pitch?

318
00:35:29,967 --> 00:35:30,301
Means?!

319
00:35:31,467 --> 00:35:32,009
Yes, pitch

320
00:35:32,467 --> 00:35:36,551
When you went behind her
asking her to love you

321
00:35:36,842 --> 00:35:38,134
Did she come to the pitch?

322
00:35:38,634 --> 00:35:39,134
No

323
00:35:39,467 --> 00:35:43,467
But today, she is coming
to become the pitch

324
00:35:46,092 --> 00:35:50,051
Audience have a lot
of expectations from you

325
00:35:52,967 --> 00:35:53,759
All the best

326
00:36:45,342 --> 00:36:48,176
Mr Santhosh Narayan
what are you looking at?

327
00:36:48,967 --> 00:36:49,967
Won't you welcome me?

328
00:36:52,551 --> 00:36:52,926
Please come

329
00:36:58,384 --> 00:36:58,842
Santhu

330
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:01,134
What is this?

331
00:37:02,217 --> 00:37:04,592
The beloved has come
after many years

332
00:37:05,051 --> 00:37:07,051
I thought you will rush
to me in high speed

333
00:37:12,384 --> 00:37:15,717
But you look so calm
with that cute smile

334
00:37:16,884 --> 00:37:17,926
You have a strong will

335
00:37:27,926 --> 00:37:29,676
So beautiful

336
00:37:31,717 --> 00:37:33,092
I asked you to book a room

337
00:37:35,134 --> 00:37:36,342
But you have booked a palace!

338
00:37:37,884 --> 00:37:38,676
Is it for me?

339
00:37:55,717 --> 00:37:59,759
Santhu, looking at your success

340
00:38:01,217 --> 00:38:02,384
I feel very happy

341
00:38:06,217 --> 00:38:09,051
You are the reason for all this Dharmika

342
00:38:12,634 --> 00:38:13,301

343
00:38:15,217 --> 00:38:15,884
Thanks for coming

Dharmika

345
00:38:21,717 --> 00:38:25,009
I am spellbound by seeing you

346
00:38:29,384 --> 00:38:34,092
I am not able to believe that
you are sitting in front of me Dharmika

347
00:38:39,842 --> 00:38:42,426
Madam asked me to decorate
this room for first night!?

348
00:38:44,217 --> 00:38:45,217
But the sound comes from here?

349
00:38:45,967 --> 00:38:50,676
Santhosh, when you were madly
in love with me during college days

350
00:38:51,342 --> 00:38:56,384
I gave you pain then
But today, I've come to you

351
00:38:57,759 --> 00:38:58,842
See how time changes!

352
00:38:59,426 --> 00:39:00,384
May I come in Sir

353
00:39:01,634 --> 00:39:02,342

They said 8pm is auspicious time

360
00:39:19,301 --> 00:39:21,217
But you have come at 7.30

361
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:23,509
Too early know?

362
00:39:23,967 --> 00:39:25,759
Okay come to the point
Come to the point

363
00:39:26,551 --> 00:39:27,509
It is your first night

364
00:39:29,051 --> 00:39:30,717
But for me it is thousand nights

365
00:39:30,967 --> 00:39:32,176
No you have got confused and
come to this room

366
00:39:32,176 --> 00:39:32,759
Don't say anything Sir

367
00:39:33,509 --> 00:39:34,176
You don't speak

368
00:39:34,759 --> 00:39:35,717
Don't waste your energy

369
00:39:36,467 --> 00:39:38,342
Energy level will go down
if you speak Sir

370
00:39:38,551 --> 00:39:39,509
Sir, Madam

371
00:39:39,717 --> 00:39:42,634
For you, dry fruits
Dry fruits madam

372
00:39:44,134 --> 00:39:49,842
I’ve mixed well with poppy milk
And brought an energy drink

373
00:39:50,676 --> 00:39:53,092
Okay, have this
Five minutes

374
00:39:56,759 --> 00:39:58,092
Madam, tell me madam

375
00:39:58,551 --> 00:39:59,509
Have you gone mad?

376
00:39:59,967 --> 00:40:02,176
I told you to decorate
the room number 1516

377
00:40:02,342 --> 00:40:02,884
Where are you now?

378
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:05,134
Oh! Sorry madam, sorry

379
00:40:05,842 --> 00:40:06,801

00:40:07,176 --> 00:40:09,426
Sorry Sir
First night is over there

381
00:40:09,592 --> 00:40:10,759
This is your night

382
00:40:12,509 --> 00:40:13,426
Hey, take back the juice

383
00:40:13,509 --> 00:40:15,842

Hey Santhu

386
00:40:20,217 --> 00:40:24,676
If the call delayed for ten minutes
then he would have..

387
00:40:34,801 --> 00:40:35,551
Crazy!

388
00:40:40,176 --> 00:40:40,967
Santhosh

389
00:40:44,259 --> 00:40:47,509
First night. First meet
First sight

390
00:40:48,467 --> 00:40:49,884
Can never be forgotten know?

391
00:40:59,009 --> 00:41:02,217
Do you remember our first meet?

392
00:41:57,801 --> 00:41:59,592
Hey Ranga
What is your problem?

393
00:41:59,967 --> 00:42:02,759
I am asking you to do
since one week. Did you do?

394
00:42:03,051 --> 00:42:04,051
What do you want now?

395
00:42:04,051 --> 00:42:07,217
If you do not come and do
I will jump down and die

396
00:42:08,759 --> 00:42:10,926
Wait a minute
before you make the jump

397
00:42:13,551 --> 00:42:15,217
Is he a student?

398
00:42:16,926 --> 00:42:20,009
Not student. A kind of student
He is a Super senior

399
00:42:23,134 --> 00:42:24,092
Very hard rock!

400
00:42:24,176 --> 00:42:29,342
Make somersault, your head
should directly hit this rock

401
00:42:29,426 --> 00:42:30,467
You will die immediately
Jump now

402
00:42:32,217 --> 00:42:32,676
Jump now

403
00:42:34,967 --> 00:42:36,801
You have placed a paving stone here!

404
00:42:37,092 --> 00:42:39,259
If he take off from there

405
00:42:39,634 --> 00:42:41,717
And lands here directly

406
00:42:42,134 --> 00:42:43,259
His head will break into pieces

407
00:42:44,842 --> 00:42:46,009
Hey where did he go?

408
00:42:47,634 --> 00:42:49,301
He was suppose land this side

409
00:42:49,509 --> 00:42:51,342
Did he land the other side by chance?

410
00:42:51,967 --> 00:42:52,342
Take off your hand

411
00:42:53,092 --> 00:42:55,801
Are you a friend?
You are a betrayer!

412
00:42:56,301 --> 00:42:57,259
Why? What happened?

413
00:42:57,259 --> 00:42:59,176
You are not concerned about me at all

414
00:42:59,342 --> 00:43:00,676
Don’t you like me?

415
00:43:01,134 --> 00:43:02,592
Who said that?
Give it

416
00:43:02,676 --> 00:43:05,634
You are doing it to everybody
Why didn’t you do it to me yet?

417
00:43:06,009 --> 00:43:07,301
Do it to me once please

418
00:43:07,301 --> 00:43:09,467
Hey what is this? disgusting!

419
00:43:09,884 --> 00:43:11,551
You are compelling him to do!

420
00:43:11,801 --> 00:43:16,259
In India, that too in public
You are asking him to do!

421
00:43:16,384 --> 00:43:17,884
Hey what is this?

422
00:43:18,259 --> 00:43:19,634
You bloody
What is he saying?

423
00:43:20,301 --> 00:43:22,092
What did you think of
when he asked me to do?

424
00:43:22,551 --> 00:43:23,217
Listen to me

425
00:43:23,676 --> 00:43:26,759
We say do your work
eat and sleep

426
00:43:27,092 --> 00:43:28,676
He is asking me to do a favour

427
00:43:28,926 --> 00:43:31,926
Out of tension he forgot to mention help
And he is just saying do it

428
00:43:32,009 --> 00:43:33,259
What did you think of?

429
00:43:34,092 --> 00:43:35,301
LD, I thought of a double meaning

430
00:43:35,884 --> 00:43:40,509
Bloody hell! Double meaning is
not in his words, it’s in your mind

431
00:43:40,884 --> 00:43:43,801
Change your mind set first
Stupid fellow

432
00:43:44,051 --> 00:43:46,134
Come. I will do it to you today

433
00:43:46,134 --> 00:43:47,634
Okay
Come let’s go

434
00:44:15,384 --> 00:44:16,634
Kalpi, you know who this is?

435
00:44:16,967 --> 00:44:17,551
Selfie Ranga

436
00:44:18,092 --> 00:44:19,592
I don’t know!
Don’t know?!

437
00:44:20,467 --> 00:44:22,592
You climbed up the building for
the one who doesn’t know you?!

438
00:44:22,926 --> 00:44:24,759
Kalpi don’t you know me?!

439
00:44:25,009 --> 00:44:27,759
I am coming behind you
since four years like a shadow

440
00:44:28,967 --> 00:44:31,217
No LD, I seriously don’t know
who he is

441
00:44:31,926 --> 00:44:33,051
Bloody idiot!

442
00:44:33,592 --> 00:44:35,259
If you go behind her
Does she have eyes in backside?

443
00:44:35,426 --> 00:44:36,592
She would have known
if you had walked in front of her

444
00:44:37,051 --> 00:44:37,967
You should not go behind a girl

445
00:44:37,967 --> 00:44:39,134
You should go in front of a girl

446
00:44:39,134 --> 00:44:40,467
Only then she will know who you are

447
00:44:40,467 --> 00:44:41,217
Right Kalpi?

448
00:44:41,217 --> 00:44:41,926
You are right LD

449
00:44:42,426 --> 00:44:45,051
We should go in front of girls
You go behind?

450
00:44:45,384 --> 00:44:47,051
How to convince her?
She doesn’t even know you

451
00:44:47,759 --> 00:44:48,801
Hey speak about love

452
00:44:49,676 --> 00:44:50,967
Oh he is annoying!

453
00:44:51,217 --> 00:44:52,967
Look, I will come to the matter
Okay

454
00:44:53,634 --> 00:44:55,676
He desires you a lot

455
00:44:55,967 --> 00:44:58,884
Not desire, love
It is true love

456
00:44:58,884 --> 00:45:01,301
I’m telling the same in Kannada
You be quiet

457
00:45:01,551 --> 00:45:01,967
Okay talk

458
00:45:02,217 --> 00:45:04,051
He loves you, desires you

459
00:45:04,426 --> 00:45:06,467
The thing is he wants to be with you

460
00:45:07,009 --> 00:45:08,217
And getting close to you

461
00:45:09,134 --> 00:45:13,176
He wants to go to parks, theatres
And then touching lightly

462
00:45:13,426 --> 00:45:15,592
And then kissing
And smooching after that

463
00:45:15,926 --> 00:45:17,551
He wants to do the rest

464
00:45:17,967 --> 00:45:19,092
Go to hell!

465
00:45:19,551 --> 00:45:21,676
No not all that
Please try to understand

466
00:45:21,759 --> 00:45:23,551
Which I said in the beginning
It is my pure love

467
00:45:24,092 --> 00:45:25,051
Oh pure love?
Yes!

468
00:45:25,551 --> 00:45:26,884
Okay I didn’t know
Your love is pure, isn’t it?

469
00:45:27,134 --> 00:45:27,884
Then all these will not be there?

470
00:45:27,884 --> 00:45:28,301
No

471
00:45:28,426 --> 00:45:30,217
Oh! Kalpi, do not worry
All these will not be happen

472
00:45:30,217 --> 00:45:31,384
He says he loves you purely

473
00:45:31,634 --> 00:45:34,467
He’s behind you for four years
Do not feel bad

474
00:45:34,634 --> 00:45:36,467
He will be with you
And loves you purely

475
00:45:36,676 --> 00:45:37,926
He will be standing
in front of your house

476
00:45:38,092 --> 00:45:40,801
When you go walk with your dog
He will stand there like a dog

477
00:45:40,801 --> 00:45:41,634
He will love you

478
00:45:41,842 --> 00:45:44,717
Even if you get married tomorrow
He will come there and bless you

479
00:45:44,801 --> 00:45:45,842
There wont be any
problem from his side

480
00:45:47,842 --> 00:45:49,467
Hey try to understand
you speak about only love

481
00:45:49,467 --> 00:45:51,426
All that you told in the beginning
I will do it

482
00:45:51,717 --> 00:45:52,801
Then you want what I told
in the beginning?

483
00:45:52,801 --> 00:45:53,217
Yes

484
00:45:53,509 --> 00:45:54,217
I should speak of pure love

485
00:45:55,092 --> 00:45:57,467
He wants to do all that
I mentioned earlier

486
00:45:57,592 --> 00:45:59,134
He is saying pure love for name sake

487
00:45:59,467 --> 00:46:00,051
Are you okay with it?

488
00:46:00,301 --> 00:46:01,592
I will hit you with slippers
you bloody

489
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:04,842
Why are you spoiling my love
in the opening?

490
00:46:05,176 --> 00:46:06,134
Speak about love

491
00:46:06,592 --> 00:46:08,842
If you say it frankly
she will beat you with slippers

492
00:46:08,842 --> 00:46:10,051
What shall I do?

493
00:46:10,634 --> 00:46:12,134
Listen, I tell you frankly

494
00:46:12,176 --> 00:46:14,217
He doesn’t want me to
brief everything

495
00:46:14,426 --> 00:46:15,384
First he love you truly

496
00:46:15,384 --> 00:46:16,551
And he will do the rest himself

497
00:46:17,092 --> 00:46:18,384
Don’t you have sisters?

498
00:46:18,801 --> 00:46:20,759
Let me know if they agree
for this kind of love

499
00:46:21,217 --> 00:46:21,884
Let me decide then

500
00:46:22,301 --> 00:46:22,717
Okay?

501
00:46:24,259 --> 00:46:24,801
Are you okay with it?

502
00:46:25,092 --> 00:46:26,092
What is this LD?

503
00:46:26,384 --> 00:46:28,134
You make friendship with
these kind of people

504
00:46:28,342 --> 00:46:30,301
What to do?!
He climbed the building for you

505
00:46:30,551 --> 00:46:32,176
I thought it was a pure love
You leave now

506
00:46:32,301 --> 00:46:32,801
I will talk to him

507
00:46:33,259 --> 00:46:35,051
You ruined my love with frank words

508
00:46:35,134 --> 00:46:35,676
Kalpi

509
00:46:36,759 --> 00:46:37,259
Listen to me

510
00:46:37,342 --> 00:46:39,092
If I had not told everything openly

511
00:46:39,092 --> 00:46:40,426
You have already wasted
your five years

512
00:46:40,426 --> 00:46:41,592
She would have beaten you to death

513
00:46:41,842 --> 00:46:42,759
You would waste another five years

514
00:46:42,967 --> 00:46:44,842
It is better to be frank with girls
in these matters

515
00:46:44,842 --> 00:46:45,301
Okay

516
00:46:45,426 --> 00:46:46,342
Understood?
Yes I understood

517
00:46:46,342 --> 00:46:47,051
Do one thing

518
00:46:47,301 --> 00:46:49,426
Love bile has reached your brain

519
00:46:50,092 --> 00:46:51,092
You know Kodanda right?
Yes

520
00:46:51,301 --> 00:46:52,926
He has arranged a good item for 500rs

521
00:46:52,926 --> 00:46:54,134
Nobody is at home

522
00:46:55,467 --> 00:46:57,884
One and two
Two times will be good

523
00:46:58,217 --> 00:47:00,509
Make love for tow times
Clear everything from your mind

524
00:47:00,801 --> 00:47:02,259
Concentrate on your studies

525
00:47:02,384 --> 00:47:02,592
Go now

526
00:47:02,926 --> 00:47:05,051
But you only helped Kumar and Ramya

527
00:47:05,301 --> 00:47:07,051
But you are asking me to
go to someone!

528
00:47:07,509 --> 00:47:08,926
Their story is different

529
00:47:09,259 --> 00:47:11,217
It was a mutual agreement
See here I will show you

530
00:47:14,259 --> 00:47:15,217
They are nearby!

531
00:47:16,801 --> 00:47:18,259
Hey you are here only?

532
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:21,092
Okay continue

533
00:47:22,426 --> 00:47:24,926
hey both agreed and
they are making love

534
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:25,717
Correct?

535
00:47:26,259 --> 00:47:27,051
She is not agreeing

536
00:47:27,176 --> 00:47:28,176
She says slippers will tear off

537
00:47:28,176 --> 00:47:29,967
She takes your sisters name
Do you really need this?

538
00:47:30,176 --> 00:47:31,634
This case is right for you

539
00:47:31,884 --> 00:47:35,092
Go love twice and
remove everything from your head

540
00:47:35,176 --> 00:47:36,259
You mean this is the right way?

541
00:47:36,592 --> 00:47:37,717
This is the right way
go now

542
00:47:37,884 --> 00:47:39,259
You have got confused with love

543
00:47:39,259 --> 00:47:41,342
Hey LD
Give me two more

544
00:47:43,092 --> 00:47:43,884
Hey you idiot!

545
00:47:44,092 --> 00:47:45,051
I will do pure love

546
00:47:45,176 --> 00:47:46,551
I'll kick you
Get lost

547
00:47:51,176 --> 00:47:53,884
You were so frank Santhu!

548
00:48:00,301 --> 00:48:04,134
Your status got changed
but not your ringtone

549
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:08,801
Hello, what is your problem?

550
00:48:09,301 --> 00:48:10,509
Come near the pitch
I will tell you

551
00:48:11,676 --> 00:48:12,759
I am near the pitch
tell me what it is

552
00:48:13,051 --> 00:48:14,509
You see two pillows on the bed right?

553
00:48:16,509 --> 00:48:17,009
Yes

554
00:48:17,509 --> 00:48:18,926
Lift the right side pillow

555
00:48:26,551 --> 00:48:27,092
Hey, what is this?

556
00:48:27,509 --> 00:48:29,009
For an exciting night

557
00:48:29,634 --> 00:48:30,884
Man force, dude!

558
00:48:31,634 --> 00:48:33,426
No matter how strong a batsman is

559
00:48:34,342 --> 00:48:35,592
Safety is very important

560
00:48:41,717 --> 00:48:42,259
Hey, anything wrong?

561
00:48:42,884 --> 00:48:45,509
Nothing Dharmika
Friends are very waggish

562
00:48:50,759 --> 00:48:54,842
During college days
You used to be so frank

563
00:48:56,009 --> 00:48:57,551
But now you are so quiet

564
00:48:58,842 --> 00:48:59,467
Are you the same person?

565
00:49:00,676 --> 00:49:01,551
Brother

566
00:49:01,967 --> 00:49:03,342
You four search that side
Okay brother

567
00:49:03,467 --> 00:49:04,717
You four search this side
Okay brother

568
00:49:04,967 --> 00:49:06,801
He will be walking in this park
Okay brother

569
00:49:07,051 --> 00:49:08,592
Beat him up and bring to me
Okay brother

570
00:49:08,592 --> 00:49:09,801
Get going
Okay brother

571
00:49:10,259 --> 00:49:10,967
Wait I’ll be back
Hey please no

572
00:49:11,134 --> 00:49:12,134
What kind of a hero?!

573
00:49:12,592 --> 00:49:12,884
Sir

574
00:49:16,551 --> 00:49:18,134
Writing a thesis on love
Love?!

575
00:49:21,176 --> 00:49:21,926
Love Sir

576
00:49:22,467 --> 00:49:23,967
Writing a thesis on love

577
00:49:24,634 --> 00:49:26,301
What is love according to you?

578
00:49:26,592 --> 00:49:27,009
Love?!

579
00:49:27,967 --> 00:49:28,301
Come here

580
00:49:34,176 --> 00:49:35,176
What does it mean Sir?

581
00:49:35,301 --> 00:49:36,384
This is not mine

582
00:49:36,717 --> 00:49:40,509
This is the thesis taught by
LD of APS college

583
00:49:41,634 --> 00:49:41,884
What?

584
00:49:42,967 --> 00:49:43,884
What is love?

585
00:49:44,217 --> 00:49:44,634
Yes Sir

586
00:49:44,967 --> 00:49:47,384
Have you enquired properly
about me?

587
00:49:47,467 --> 00:49:48,634
I enquired in detail Sir

588
00:49:49,009 --> 00:49:50,301
Complete details?
Yes Sir

589
00:49:50,676 --> 00:49:51,967
Did they told you to about me?

590
00:49:52,384 --> 00:49:54,592
Yes, everyone calls you Love guru

591
00:49:55,592 --> 00:49:56,342
Keep those books here

592
00:49:57,051 --> 00:49:57,759
These books?

593
00:49:58,092 --> 00:49:58,634
Keep it here

594
00:50:00,134 --> 00:50:00,967
Keep that bag here

595
00:50:01,676 --> 00:50:02,634
It will be easy for you

596
00:50:02,801 --> 00:50:03,217
Okay Sir

597
00:50:05,259 --> 00:50:06,842
Now tell me
Sir what is love?

598
00:50:08,342 --> 00:50:09,134
Cover us with that umbrella

599
00:50:10,134 --> 00:50:11,176
Cover us? why?

600
00:50:11,176 --> 00:50:12,301
So that no one should see

601
00:50:16,759 --> 00:50:17,259
Leave me Sir

602
00:50:17,509 --> 00:50:17,801
Why?

603
00:50:17,842 --> 00:50:19,051
Is this called love?

604
00:50:19,467 --> 00:50:20,467
I asked you to talk about love

605
00:50:20,592 --> 00:50:21,634
But you are doing something else

606
00:50:21,926 --> 00:50:25,134
There is no other forms of love
This is what love is

607
00:50:25,717 --> 00:50:27,342
Sir this is not love
Why?

608
00:50:27,384 --> 00:50:29,134
I was expecting some hel for my thesis

609
00:50:30,342 --> 00:50:31,967
Oh you are writing a thesis on love!

610
00:50:32,759 --> 00:50:34,634
You mean, I’ve to teach you
about love in detail!?

611
00:50:36,217 --> 00:50:37,217
Yes, teach her

612
00:50:39,467 --> 00:50:42,467
Just now students from that class
went out, nobody is there

613
00:50:42,801 --> 00:50:43,842
Let us go there

614
00:50:43,926 --> 00:50:45,676
I will close the door and teach you
about love very clearly

615
00:50:45,676 --> 00:50:45,884
Come

616
00:50:46,009 --> 00:50:46,967
No no no
Sir

617
00:50:47,467 --> 00:50:49,926
What is this Sir?
You are talking like this!

618
00:50:50,592 --> 00:50:55,051
Everybody says you are a love guru
very talented and very differen

619
00:50:55,384 --> 00:50:56,301
What is this Sir!?

620
00:50:56,592 --> 00:50:58,967
I came to you
But you are not helping me

621
00:50:59,634 --> 00:51:00,342
You do one thing

622
00:51:01,217 --> 00:51:07,384
Have pista, dry coconut
Cashew twice everyday

623
00:51:07,801 --> 00:51:09,384
If you have it for one week
or for fifteen days

624
00:51:10,342 --> 00:51:14,634
Then, you will teach about
love to everyone

625
00:51:14,634 --> 00:51:15,384
Isn’t it dude?
Let’s go

626
00:51:16,009 --> 00:51:18,717
Once the bile goes high
All barriers will break

627
00:51:18,842 --> 00:51:20,551
We are in love from last six years

628
00:51:22,176 --> 00:51:23,842
Still how long should I wait?

629
00:51:25,092 --> 00:51:28,009
Darling, wait for another six months

630
00:51:28,217 --> 00:51:30,884
Lets get married after the exams

631
00:51:55,176 --> 00:51:56,509
Hey what are you applying?

632
00:51:57,134 --> 00:51:59,634
This AcneStar is an acne specialist

633
00:52:00,134 --> 00:52:02,717
Can I use it please
Look at my pimples

634
00:52:02,967 --> 00:52:04,884
Apply it, it will go off soon

635
00:52:05,176 --> 00:52:05,801
Thank you

636
00:52:06,426 --> 00:52:08,467
Hey Dharmika
Are you mad?

637
00:52:09,551 --> 00:52:09,842
Why?

638
00:52:10,217 --> 00:52:13,342
He is corrupting boys who are in love
 by giving them condoms

639
00:52:13,884 --> 00:52:14,717
He is a madman

640
00:52:15,301 --> 00:52:18,259
You are trying to use him for your PHD

641
00:52:19,801 --> 00:52:22,926
At the end you will be used
for his philosophy

642
00:52:27,259 --> 00:52:27,509
No

643
00:52:29,926 --> 00:52:34,301
If I have to complete my thesis
I will have to study him

644
00:52:35,448 --> 00:52:37,865
This is an one day match

645
00:52:42,365 --> 00:52:44,782
Tendulkar is batting now

646
00:52:57,323 --> 00:52:58,240
Hey why did you got bold out?

647
00:52:58,782 --> 00:52:59,948
If you had stood for one more over

648
00:53:04,615 --> 00:53:05,823
Hello! thesis

649
00:53:06,865 --> 00:53:08,448
You realised what I said
yesterday is correct

650
00:53:08,657 --> 00:53:10,407
So you have come here
for practical, isn’t it?

651
00:53:10,657 --> 00:53:12,073
No need of practical Sir

652
00:53:12,490 --> 00:53:13,948
Theory is so boring

653
00:53:14,032 --> 00:53:15,865
You will understand practical
in a better way

654
00:53:15,865 --> 00:53:16,948
Sir please

655
00:53:17,198 --> 00:53:19,365
Give me some time Sir
I want to talk to you

656
00:53:19,365 --> 00:53:20,032
Okay
Come

657
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:23,240
Why did you got out?

658
00:53:23,823 --> 00:53:25,032
I tried to hit six but got out

659
00:53:25,073 --> 00:53:26,198
Men are like this

660
00:53:26,365 --> 00:53:27,782
In the anxiety to hit six

661
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:30,032
You become out

662
00:53:31,490 --> 00:53:34,657
You should always play
defence in a game

663
00:53:36,073 --> 00:53:37,198
Only then there will be satisfaction

664
00:53:37,865 --> 00:53:40,823
In defence we don’t out
But we can’t win the match

665
00:53:41,198 --> 00:53:42,115
So I tried to hit six

666
00:53:42,990 --> 00:53:46,115
Hey why are you playing defence?
Play sex

667
00:53:47,823 --> 00:53:48,448
I mean six

668
00:53:49,407 --> 00:53:51,865
Because of you I told him to play sex

669
00:53:52,615 --> 00:53:52,948
Sir

670
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,823
I will frankly ask you a question

671
00:53:57,615 --> 00:53:59,490
You should frankly answer

672
00:54:00,907 --> 00:54:01,157
Go ahead

673
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:02,698
That is

674
00:54:03,032 --> 00:54:05,240
Why do you like sex so much?

675
00:54:11,573 --> 00:54:14,907
Six!

676
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:17,823
What is your problem?

677
00:54:17,823 --> 00:54:22,115
How can you talk about that
with such an ease?

678
00:54:22,115 --> 00:54:23,990
About six?
No Sir

679
00:54:24,490 --> 00:54:25,907
About Sex
Okay

680
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,532
There is no question of easy
or difficulty in that

681
00:54:31,157 --> 00:54:33,782
Are you writing the thesis
on love or sex?

682
00:54:34,365 --> 00:54:35,365
On love
On love

683
00:54:35,532 --> 00:54:38,240
I say love is sex, actually
You feel hungry right?

684
00:54:38,365 --> 00:54:39,198
You have food right?

685
00:54:39,448 --> 00:54:40,240
You sleep right?

686
00:54:40,448 --> 00:54:42,782
It’s just another activity
It is as easy as we sip tea

687
00:54:43,615 --> 00:54:44,907
Why are you obsessed with it?

688
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,365
What is this Sir?
What do you know about love?

689
00:54:47,782 --> 00:54:49,698
Love is the supreme attainment of life

690
00:54:50,573 --> 00:54:51,740
Love is the fifth Veda

691
00:54:52,948 --> 00:54:54,157
Love is God

692
00:54:54,323 --> 00:54:55,448
Understand it
What?

693
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:57,240
Love is God?
Yes

694
00:54:57,865 --> 00:55:02,573
Do you think lovers worship and pray?

695
00:55:03,615 --> 00:55:05,573
I will clearly explain you about love

696
00:55:10,615 --> 00:55:10,948
Sit

697
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:12,032
Look

698
00:55:36,115 --> 00:55:40,365
If the trump card of I love you is thrown
And if it becomes okay

699
00:55:40,573 --> 00:55:41,948
Then everything will becomes okay

700
00:55:42,865 --> 00:55:45,490
Pick up, drop then pack up
That is what love is

701
00:55:45,698 --> 00:55:46,490
You get that?

702
00:55:46,698 --> 00:55:48,948
There is nothing special in love
Try to understand

703
00:55:50,573 --> 00:55:52,948
Beyond that there is a pure love

704
00:55:53,407 --> 00:55:54,490
Oh my god!

705
00:55:54,907 --> 00:55:57,073
Love is a feeling
Love is divine

706
00:55:57,448 --> 00:55:59,865
Love is purity, love is sacrifice
Do you know that?

707
00:56:00,323 --> 00:56:01,823
Enough

708
00:56:02,032 --> 00:56:03,698
A scientist just like you

709
00:56:03,948 --> 00:56:05,782
Tried to prove what love is to this world

710
00:56:06,032 --> 00:56:07,157
Do you know what he did for that?

711
00:56:08,032 --> 00:56:10,698
Do you know which animal
shows more love?

712
00:56:10,990 --> 00:56:11,323
Monkey!

713
00:56:11,782 --> 00:56:13,240
It carries it’s baby here always

714
00:56:13,615 --> 00:56:15,240
He kept a monkey and it’s baby

715
00:56:15,490 --> 00:56:17,240
He made a glass tank for that

716
00:56:17,698 --> 00:56:20,407
He made a system in which
water can be supplied

717
00:56:20,782 --> 00:56:23,865
He put monkey and it’s baby inside that
And supplied water into it

718
00:56:24,323 --> 00:56:25,490
As the water level increased

719
00:56:25,532 --> 00:56:27,365
That monkey was feared that
its baby will sink down

720
00:56:27,365 --> 00:56:28,865
It placed its baby here

721
00:56:29,115 --> 00:56:30,448
Water level increased again

722
00:56:30,448 --> 00:56:31,740
Then it placed the baby on it’s head

723
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:36,532
When the water lever reached
mother monkey’s nose

724
00:56:36,865 --> 00:56:38,032
It started struggling

725
00:56:38,032 --> 00:56:39,698
it threw the baby down and
it came up

726
00:56:41,657 --> 00:56:42,407
What happened to the love?

727
00:56:43,157 --> 00:56:43,698
That’s all

728
00:56:44,032 --> 00:56:46,532
No one loves others
than he loves himself

729
00:56:46,657 --> 00:56:47,907
Everyone is selfish here

730
00:56:47,990 --> 00:56:51,282
They love for
their happiness and joy

731
00:56:52,823 --> 00:56:54,948
Love has a greater place in this world

732
00:56:56,365 --> 00:56:56,657
look

733
00:56:57,907 --> 00:56:59,907
This is the thesis prepared by me

734
00:57:02,115 --> 00:57:02,782
Read this

735
00:57:03,115 --> 00:57:04,407
You will know what is love

736
00:57:04,948 --> 00:57:09,907
You are spoiling boys
by writing such false thesis

737
00:57:42,948 --> 00:57:43,407
Dharmi

738
00:57:45,032 --> 00:57:46,573
Why are you upset since morning?

739
00:57:47,532 --> 00:57:48,657
Did that lunatic say anything wrong?

740
00:57:52,573 --> 00:57:52,865
No

741
00:57:56,948 --> 00:58:00,323
When the whole world speaks
in one angle about love

742
00:58:01,907 --> 00:58:03,657
He is speaking in some other angle

743
00:58:07,073 --> 00:58:08,990
Should we call him a lunatic

744
00:58:09,907 --> 00:58:10,865
Or intelligent man!

745
00:58:13,615 --> 00:58:14,657
I am getting confused

746
00:58:16,657 --> 00:58:18,823
I think
He is not mental ya

747
00:58:20,032 --> 00:58:21,073
Cent percent

748
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:23,157
He is intelligent

749
00:58:25,073 --> 00:58:26,907
If I study him completely

750
00:58:27,948 --> 00:58:29,615
I will definitely get my PhD

751
00:58:30,573 --> 00:58:36,698
From tomorrow Operation LD
Starts

752
00:58:40,198 --> 00:58:42,782
Salutations to Goddess Mahalakshmi
Who wears white cloth

753
00:58:46,948 --> 00:58:49,407
salutations to Goddess Mahalakshmi,
Who wears white cloth

754
00:58:49,448 --> 00:58:52,740
Who wears variety of ornaments

755
00:58:57,615 --> 00:58:59,448
Wow!

756
00:58:59,907 --> 00:59:01,532
What a realisation!

757
00:59:01,698 --> 00:59:04,282
Full cool!

758
00:59:05,323 --> 00:59:07,823
LD, I made love
completely as you said

759
00:59:08,198 --> 00:59:09,532
Wow super
Everything came out

760
00:59:09,823 --> 00:59:10,948
What?
That which was in my head

761
00:59:11,532 --> 00:59:13,698
No my mind is in peace

762
00:59:14,407 --> 00:59:15,532
Do know one thing LD?

763
00:59:16,073 --> 00:59:18,657
I am the topper in internals

764
00:59:19,032 --> 00:59:22,823
Super! Keep it down
Down!

765
00:59:23,073 --> 00:59:24,615
When it is up
I have given you know

766
00:59:26,907 --> 00:59:27,407
Hi Sir

767
00:59:30,323 --> 00:59:31,073
What is the matter?

768
00:59:31,282 --> 00:59:32,032
Sir that is

769
00:59:33,115 --> 00:59:36,323
You spent last night staring at the fan

770
00:59:36,323 --> 00:59:38,615
You recalled my monkey story

771
00:59:38,615 --> 00:59:40,157
Now you have come here to say
that I am right, isn’t it?

772
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:40,740
Yes Sir

773
00:59:41,865 --> 00:59:45,032
That monkey story was wonderful

774
00:59:45,490 --> 00:59:50,865
So I want to spend time with you
to study on you

775
00:59:51,865 --> 00:59:54,532
You see, I haven’t
understood what I am

776
00:59:54,823 --> 00:59:57,782
How will you study me
and write a thesis?

777
00:59:58,948 --> 01:00:00,032
Please do not say no Sir

778
01:00:00,615 --> 01:00:01,157
Please Sir

779
01:00:01,865 --> 01:00:03,282
Keep me Sir

780
01:00:04,948 --> 01:00:06,157
What?
Yes Sir

781
01:00:06,532 --> 01:00:10,823
Many girls will ask to marry them
Nobody will ask to keep them. Keep her

782
01:00:12,198 --> 01:00:13,157
Sir
Keep?

783
01:00:13,323 --> 01:00:15,448
Yes Sir Please Sir
Do not say no

784
01:00:15,865 --> 01:00:17,323
I didn’t get you
What do you mean by keeping?

785
01:00:17,323 --> 01:00:17,990
I mean

786
01:00:18,323 --> 01:00:19,365
If I am with you

787
01:00:19,657 --> 01:00:21,698
It will be helpful for my
love thesis

788
01:00:22,032 --> 01:00:25,865
I’ll take care of all your works

789
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:28,198
I will hold an umbrella
Will give you dry fruits

790
01:00:28,198 --> 01:00:29,198
I will do pick up and drop

791
01:00:29,698 --> 01:00:31,990
Sir!
Please Sir

792
01:00:35,532 --> 01:00:39,698
When a dimple girl like you
pleads me to keep

793
01:00:55,448 --> 01:00:56,782
Love is 420

794
01:00:57,198 --> 01:00:58,865
Sweet nothing is superb

795
01:01:00,698 --> 01:01:01,990
Girls are sharp

796
01:01:02,365 --> 01:01:03,698
Boys hearts get looted

797
01:01:03,990 --> 01:01:05,740
Life is A cinema

798
01:01:13,698 --> 01:01:16,115
Teacher o teacher of love

799
01:01:16,490 --> 01:01:19,407
Love class has just begun

800
01:01:20,490 --> 01:01:25,990
I’ll come behind you
teach the lesson of love

801
01:01:30,865 --> 01:01:33,740
Hey kid, what a pose!?

802
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:36,573
You are very annoying

803
01:01:37,865 --> 01:01:39,948
Boosting up too much!

804
01:01:41,115 --> 01:01:43,615
What are you studying?

805
01:01:44,990 --> 01:01:46,407
BA?

806
01:01:46,698 --> 01:01:48,115
MA?

807
01:01:48,407 --> 01:01:50,323
Then which one?

808
01:01:51,407 --> 01:01:53,782
Do you know M.Com?

809
01:01:56,740 --> 01:02:00,698
M.com! It means
Master of Lusty fluid

810
01:02:01,115 --> 01:02:04,157
Very good, it’s my subject

811
01:02:18,865 --> 01:02:24,573
Teacher o teacher of love
Love class has just begun

812
01:02:25,615 --> 01:02:31,365
I’ll come behind you
teach the lesson of love

813
01:02:42,865 --> 01:02:49,198
Daily class miss
Miss is our syllabus

814
01:02:49,698 --> 01:02:55,448
College campus is our guesthouse
Classroom is our bedroom

815
01:03:20,573 --> 01:03:22,740
How many cases have you made?

816
01:03:23,990 --> 01:03:26,532
and how much marks have you scored?

817
01:03:27,740 --> 01:03:30,282
First class or just pass?

818
01:03:31,282 --> 01:03:36,532
? Then how much is the marks
in respective subjects?

819
01:03:38,490 --> 01:03:39,448
Zero

820
01:03:40,157 --> 01:03:43,865
One has no value in front of
Zero in this world

821
01:03:44,990 --> 01:03:51,532
Zero has very good market here
Don’t worry play the beats

822
01:03:52,115 --> 01:03:55,198
I’ll tell you a secret
Love is a waste of time

823
01:03:55,573 --> 01:03:58,407
My route is direct shooter

824
01:04:01,698 --> 01:04:04,448
Love is a big disease

825
01:04:05,115 --> 01:04:07,740
Once it attacks us
we kick our bucket soon

826
01:04:08,490 --> 01:04:14,615
Everybody lock your hearts
don’t get married soon

827
01:04:15,407 --> 01:04:21,573
If we believe girls makeup
we must end up washing tea cup

828
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:28,323
Break up happens everyday
so keep a back up

829
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:37,157
Love is the true wealth on Earth

830
01:04:38,115 --> 01:04:44,157
True love is equivalent to mother

831
01:04:45,032 --> 01:04:50,823
Danger, once love virus attacks us

832
01:04:51,823 --> 01:04:57,740
Why love? just romance all the time

833
01:04:58,698 --> 01:05:02,657
No matter what

834
01:05:05,615 --> 01:05:09,823
Love is God

835
01:05:12,448 --> 01:05:16,323
No matter what

836
01:05:19,157 --> 01:05:23,323
One who is in love is a madman

837
01:05:29,782 --> 01:05:30,032
Madam

838
01:05:31,282 --> 01:05:33,448
Do you want to score distinction in PhD?

839
01:05:35,615 --> 01:05:37,865
Then come down to pooja
at seven in the evening

840
01:05:39,032 --> 01:05:39,657

841
01:05:40,157 --> 01:05:41,573
Practical pooja madam

842
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:45,365

850
01:06:05,407 --> 01:06:07,740
He is the saviour

852
01:06:09,407 --> 01:06:11,490

This night is very beautiful

854
01:06:15,157 --> 01:06:18,532

You have decorated the cot
as if it is a first night?

863
01:06:36,573 --> 01:06:37,407
This is a lab

864
01:06:37,532 --> 01:06:38,365

873
01:06:51,823 --> 01:06:54,073
The one who was behind you for thesis

874
01:06:54,615 --> 01:06:55,115
Dharmika?!

875
01:06:55,532 --> 01:06:56,573

You start as soon as she comes

877
01:06:59,948 --> 01:07:01,532

Why this flower in your hand?

889
01:07:40,490 --> 01:07:43,282
Dad the thing is

01:07:43,282 --> 01:07:44,907

Yes I was worshiping
Do it

892
01:07:47,698 --> 01:07:51,740
Worshiping God is
good for body and mind

893

You have to worship
Yes dad, I'll do it

894
01:07:56,407 --> 01:07:58,740

01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:53,865
You are spoiled by your bad company

918
01:08:56,073 --> 01:08:57,073
You naughty

919
01:08:59,323 --> 01:09:02,573
Don't test my patience!
I'll not spare you

920
01:09:14,532 --> 01:09:16,407
You naughty

921
01:09:20,823 --> 01:09:21,782
I'll teach you a lesson

922
01:09:31,282 --> 01:09:32,782
What do you want?

923
01:09:34,927 --> 01:09:38,219
YOu see it in a dirty way?!

924
01:09:38,802 --> 01:09:41,260
Say sorry

925
01:09:43,594 --> 01:09:44,302
You better be

926
01:09:48,885 --> 01:09:50,135
You trouble so much

927
01:09:51,969 --> 01:09:55,427
I am very hungry
order for food

928
01:09:56,552 --> 01:09:57,719
I will get freshened up

929
01:10:59,010 --> 01:11:00,302
Hi LD
HI aunties

930
01:11:04,677 --> 01:11:05,302
HI
Hi LD

931
01:11:05,510 --> 01:11:06,594
Did you perform pooja last night?

932
01:11:07,385 --> 01:11:08,719
My dad came at the same time

933
01:11:08,719 --> 01:11:10,719
That’s is the reason for waiting
since morning!?

934
01:11:11,177 --> 01:11:11,552
Who?

935
01:11:12,385 --> 01:11:12,844
Hi Sir

936
01:11:13,385 --> 01:11:15,177
Greetings
Greetings. How are you?

937
01:11:16,510 --> 01:11:17,719
Sir, sorry Sir

938
01:11:17,927 --> 01:11:20,760
Did pooja got cancelled
because I came late?

939
01:11:21,094 --> 01:11:21,844
No

940
01:11:21,844 --> 01:11:24,927
Look, what ever I do
is for your love thesis

941
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:25,760
There is nothing personal

942
01:11:26,677 --> 01:11:27,135
Okay Sir

943
01:11:27,927 --> 01:11:28,260
Sir

944
01:11:29,302 --> 01:11:30,552
I have one more doubt

945
01:11:31,635 --> 01:11:37,010
Nandi hills is called as lover’s spot
A paradise for lovers

946
01:11:38,677 --> 01:11:41,094
Take me to Nnandi hills once

947
01:11:41,219 --> 01:11:43,344
You are planning for the practical?!

948
01:12:06,969 --> 01:12:09,552
Every lover is meditating on love

949
01:12:09,844 --> 01:12:12,635
Yes! Every part of the body
is in meditative state!

950
01:12:12,885 --> 01:12:15,260
Sir, isn't love a meditation?!

951
01:12:15,802 --> 01:12:20,052
Wait for half an hour
let the Sun go down

952
01:12:20,385 --> 01:12:22,927
I'll practically show you
what love is

953
01:12:22,927 --> 01:12:24,802
Okay Sir
I will note down in detail Sir

954
01:12:25,552 --> 01:12:27,052
Its crowded here
Let’s go somewhere else

955
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:29,844
Leave me, this is the reason
I don't like to come with you

956
01:12:32,260 --> 01:12:36,177
I'll show you naked truth as it is
be ready to see it

957
01:12:37,219 --> 01:12:38,177
I here sound some where here!

958
01:12:48,010 --> 01:12:49,469
Note it down, in detail

959
01:12:50,260 --> 01:12:51,302
Look where his hands are moving

960
01:12:57,427 --> 01:13:02,260
She is writing a thesis on love
You do it, continue please

961
01:13:02,427 --> 01:13:04,469
You are disturbing us
Hey just a minute, hello hello

962
01:13:04,552 --> 01:13:05,677
Hello, stop

963
01:13:06,385 --> 01:13:09,385
Did you see the practical love
behind the bush?

964
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:11,552
you are showing me such dirty things

965
01:13:11,844 --> 01:13:12,844
Don’t you common sense?

966
01:13:13,635 --> 01:13:16,260
This is not vulgar
This is the pinnacle of Love

967
01:13:16,302 --> 01:13:16,885
Shut up

968
01:13:17,552 --> 01:13:19,135
I don’t want such vulgar love

969
01:13:19,510 --> 01:13:20,635
You will never change in your life

970
01:13:20,635 --> 01:13:23,260
I came behind you for my thesis
It was my mistake

971
01:13:23,260 --> 01:13:25,260
Dharmika, the purpose of love is this only

972
01:13:26,219 --> 01:13:28,385
I will never be with you
Good bye

973
01:13:30,802 --> 01:13:32,344
She’s a gone case!

974
01:13:32,510 --> 01:13:34,719
She's neither innocent
Nor matured enough

975
01:13:35,635 --> 01:13:39,510
Why do I have to take this
 un wanted burden?!

976
01:13:40,094 --> 01:13:43,802
Am I going nuts in her company?!
She's dangerous!

977
01:14:27,344 --> 01:14:27,844
Hey beat him

978
01:16:56,802 --> 01:17:03,677
There is a stone in the place of your heart

979
01:17:05,135 --> 01:17:11,719
Now it is getting proved
it’s a not a stone but a lie

980
01:17:13,802 --> 01:17:21,802
It is foolishness to seek love
in rude talks

981
01:17:23,885 --> 01:17:31,635
Can there be modesty in a person
who has no emotion

982
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:39,927
Looniness will not vanish though a friend
is next to you who knows no value of love

983
01:17:40,135 --> 01:17:46,969
There is a stone in the place of your heart

984
01:17:48,427 --> 01:17:55,260
Now it is getting proved
it’s a not a stone but a lie

985
01:18:10,427 --> 01:18:15,094
Not for any pleasure

986
01:18:17,135 --> 01:18:21,885
you are unhappy

987
01:18:23,802 --> 01:18:29,260
It is the time for hearts to meet
do you have mercy?

988
01:18:30,552 --> 01:18:35,885
Does the memory has forgotten
that eyes dream?

989
01:18:37,260 --> 01:18:40,302
There is a lacking of love

990
01:18:40,552 --> 01:18:43,552
where are you o love?

991
01:18:43,802 --> 01:18:45,719
Is it right to leave me?

992
01:19:13,927 --> 01:19:17,927
Love can’t be done

993
01:19:20,552 --> 01:19:25,135
Love happens

994
01:19:26,969 --> 01:19:32,677
someone gets impressed by someone

995
01:19:33,844 --> 01:19:39,302
That which doesn’t get’s fulfilled
in hiding will makes us mad

996
01:19:40,635 --> 01:19:43,594
Meeting of eyes is the identity

997
01:19:43,927 --> 01:19:46,927
Let the meeting happen
again and again

998
01:19:47,219 --> 01:19:49,302
These kind of feeling is love

999
01:19:50,052 --> 01:19:57,344
There is a stone in the place of your heart

1000
01:20:41,094 --> 01:20:43,010
Love is the supreme attainment of life

1001
01:20:45,219 --> 01:20:46,385
Love is the fifth Veda

1002
01:21:18,469 --> 01:21:19,219
Senior

1003
01:21:19,844 --> 01:21:22,219
Everybody in college are
talking about selfie

1004
01:21:22,635 --> 01:21:23,677
What is selfie?

1005
01:21:24,802 --> 01:21:25,594
You are dumb

1006
01:21:25,969 --> 01:21:27,427
Don't you know what selfie is?!

1007
01:21:27,719 --> 01:21:29,927
Holding ours in our own hand

1008
01:21:30,802 --> 01:21:31,885
clicking

1009
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:34,844
Oh that’s it?

1010
01:21:35,510 --> 01:21:37,260
Oh that’s it?!
Yes

1011
01:21:37,677 --> 01:21:40,677
LD why are you low?
What;s wrong?!

1012
01:21:41,219 --> 01:21:43,760
Dharmika is not seen
 since last few days

1013
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:44,219
Is it?

1014
01:21:44,927 --> 01:21:48,052
I don’t know what to do!

1015
01:21:48,552 --> 01:21:49,344
I am not feeling hungry

1016
01:21:50,177 --> 01:21:51,010
I don’t know what’s happening to me

1017
01:21:51,552 --> 01:21:52,760
Do you feel like doing?

1018
01:21:53,385 --> 01:21:55,010
I am feeling sad about you

1019
01:21:58,802 --> 01:22:00,844
Take this, make love

1020
01:22:01,510 --> 01:22:03,094
Throw out all that is there in your mind

1021
01:22:03,302 --> 01:22:04,052
You will come up in life

1022
01:22:04,510 --> 01:22:05,052
Take it

1023
01:22:06,969 --> 01:22:10,010
You throw back my dialogue to me
I am not desperate like you

1024
01:22:10,885 --> 01:22:12,385
My feeling is something different

1025
01:22:34,357 --> 01:22:36,232
Hey Kudumi?
Did you see Dharmika?

1026
01:22:36,857 --> 01:22:37,732
No I didn’t

1027

Hey come here

1028
01:22:41,023 --> 01:22:41,523

Did you see Dharmika?
I have not seen her

1030
01:22:43,857 --> 01:22:45,773
You come to college and
don’t see friends

1031
01:22:48,898 --> 01:22:50,690
Hello stop

01:23:07,565 --> 01:23:08,690
LD is calling you

1039
01:23:09,398 --> 01:23:11,482
Hey Vidya, where is Dharmika?

1040
01:23:11,565 --> 01:23:13,273

Where is Dharmika?

1044
01:23:23,607 --> 01:23:24,398
She went to her native

1045
01:23:24,398 --> 01:23:25,857
Native?
Which place?

1046
01:23:26,898 --> 01:23:28,648
Thotambailu
Thotambailu?!

1047
01:23:29,940 --> 01:23:30,690
Do you have her address?

1048
01:23:31,857 --> 01:23:33,440
I do not know her address

1049
01:24:17,357 --> 01:24:20,232
Our vehicles comes only till here

1050
01:24:20,898 --> 01:24:22,315
Further road is not good in condition

1051
01:24:23,065 --> 01:24:23,857
How long from here?

1052
01:24:24,190 --> 01:24:26,232
Ten to twelve kilometres from here
Should I walk

1053
01:24:26,357 --> 01:24:27,732
Yes go straight

1054
01:24:42,482 --> 01:24:43,982

Oh! Even I am going that way

1056
01:24:45,857 --> 01:24:46,273
Thank you

1057
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:30,107
Look mister

1058
01:25:30,607 --> 01:25:31,523
life is like this

1059
01:25:31,773 --> 01:25:34,940
In young age we fall for
beautiful girls

1060
01:25:35,523 --> 01:25:38,315
We forget studies
which provides us food and life

1061
01:25:39,898 --> 01:25:40,690
Take me for instance

1062
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:46,232
From 7th standard to my masters
Not even a single girl looked at me

1063
01:25:46,523 --> 01:25:47,107
I swear

1064
01:25:47,690 --> 01:25:49,690
But the girl who loved me

1065
01:25:49,898 --> 01:25:51,982
lived in front of my house
And I didn’t know that

1066
01:25:52,190 --> 01:25:53,107
Is it?
Of course

1067
01:25:53,940 --> 01:26:00,398
Like wise God has prewritten in fate
match of every pair

1068
01:26:01,148 --> 01:26:06,815
But we go haywire
by falling behind girls

1069
01:26:08,398 --> 01:26:11,815
If God has made that girl for you

1070
01:26:12,023 --> 01:26:13,148
You will defiantly get her

1071
01:26:13,690 --> 01:26:15,315
I am telling you
You don’t worry

1072
01:26:15,773 --> 01:26:16,732
Thank you very much

1073
01:26:18,107 --> 01:26:22,315
I want a beautiful flower
to propose my girl

1074
01:26:22,898 --> 01:26:23,982
Do we get rose nearby?

1075
01:26:24,232 --> 01:26:25,815
Ya you get it heaven
heaven?

1076
01:26:26,940 --> 01:26:27,357
Yes

1077
01:26:28,023 --> 01:26:30,148
Our heaven is nearby
I will take you there

1078
01:26:31,190 --> 01:26:32,607
Name itself is wonderful!

1079
01:26:41,940 --> 01:26:44,232
He has come from Bangalore
Get him a good bouquet

1080
01:26:44,315 --> 01:26:44,732
What’s the occasion?

1081
01:26:44,940 --> 01:26:48,357
He is going to propose
his girl friend for the first time

1082
01:26:48,815 --> 01:26:51,357
Give something which
will make her agree instantly

1083
01:26:51,857 --> 01:26:53,357
I’ve made one using
100 roses exclusively for lovers

1084
01:26:53,357 --> 01:26:54,107
Excellent
Give it

1085
01:26:54,482 --> 01:26:54,732
Take it

1086
01:26:55,273 --> 01:26:56,523
Very nice fragrance

1087
01:26:56,523 --> 01:26:57,148
It is full of roses

1088
01:26:57,273 --> 01:26:57,690
Brother take it

1089
01:26:58,273 --> 01:26:58,607
Wow

1090
01:27:01,982 --> 01:27:02,940
What a co-incidence!

1091
01:27:03,357 --> 01:27:05,648
You are taking flowers for your beloved

1092
01:27:05,773 --> 01:27:08,023
The girl who loves me likes fish a lot

1093
01:27:08,440 --> 01:27:09,607
So I am taking fishes to her

1094
01:27:09,898 --> 01:27:11,107
We both are on same track

1095
01:27:11,732 --> 01:27:12,732
Mine is fish and yours is flower

1096
01:27:12,940 --> 01:27:13,607
Fish and flower

1097
01:27:16,607 --> 01:27:17,523
This is the university

1098
01:27:17,648 --> 01:27:18,065
Okay thank you
Bye

1099
01:27:38,440 --> 01:27:39,232
Greetings
Greetings

1100
01:27:40,023 --> 01:27:42,857
I wanted to meet Dharmika
She just now went down

1101
01:28:10,065 --> 01:28:10,440
Dharmika!

1102
01:28:25,773 --> 01:28:27,398
Hey what a surprise?!

1103
01:28:28,148 --> 01:28:28,690
How come you here?

1104
01:28:31,940 --> 01:28:34,523
Oh you have any
connection here with someone?

1105
01:28:35,273 --> 01:28:38,023
Forget about Bangalore
Won’t you spare Mangaloreans

1106
01:28:38,398 --> 01:28:39,815
I have come here to see you

1107
01:28:40,023 --> 01:28:40,565
What is the matter?

1108
01:28:40,940 --> 01:28:41,815
There is a good news for you

1109
01:28:42,148 --> 01:28:42,648
What is that?

1110
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:55,857
Dharmika, you showed me what love is

1111
01:28:58,773 --> 01:28:59,273
I love you

1112
01:29:07,732 --> 01:29:08,148
Is it?

1113
01:29:09,107 --> 01:29:10,065
Even you fell in love?

1114
01:29:11,315 --> 01:29:14,482
Lets go to some hill!
In which bush shall we take refuge?

1115
01:29:16,648 --> 01:29:17,898
Have you brought that?
That thing

1116
01:29:20,773 --> 01:29:21,190
Tell me

1117
01:29:22,148 --> 01:29:22,815
Have you brought it?

1118
01:29:23,273 --> 01:29:25,023
Dharmika stop kidding

1119
01:29:25,523 --> 01:29:26,732
I am serious

1120
01:29:27,648 --> 01:29:28,982
I am seriously in love with you

1121
01:29:29,273 --> 01:29:30,148
Great!

1122
01:29:30,690 --> 01:29:31,690
Do you know something?

1123
01:29:32,648 --> 01:29:37,565
When you spoke ill about love
And stamped on my thesis

1124
01:29:38,315 --> 01:29:39,690
I decided on the same day

1125
01:29:40,773 --> 01:29:45,023
My thesis will get a value only when
I make you understand what is love

1126
01:29:46,773 --> 01:29:49,773
So I chose you as my subject

1127
01:29:51,648 --> 01:29:52,732
I came along with you

1128
01:29:53,398 --> 01:29:54,523
I did all that you said

1129
01:29:54,898 --> 01:29:56,982
Because I knew that

1130
01:29:58,107 --> 01:30:00,690
You will come here in search of me

1131
01:30:01,107 --> 01:30:03,732
About which love you spoke ill

1132
01:30:04,190 --> 01:30:06,065
You have lowered your head

1133
01:30:06,732 --> 01:30:08,023
Kneeled down in front of me

1134
01:30:08,690 --> 01:30:10,815
And surrendered yourself
for the same love

1135
01:30:12,232 --> 01:30:13,482
This is the power of love

1136
01:30:16,440 --> 01:30:18,440
I knew you will come in
search of me

1137
01:30:19,232 --> 01:30:22,523
So I have kept two blank pages
in this thesis book

1138
01:30:22,565 --> 01:30:24,065
I’ve been waiting for you to come

1139
01:30:28,023 --> 01:30:29,607
Today you have come in
search of me

1140
01:30:30,232 --> 01:30:32,815
That means
Today my thesis got completed

1141
01:30:33,315 --> 01:30:34,565
I will write these two pages

1142
01:30:34,940 --> 01:30:36,148
I'll complete it today

1143
01:30:36,482 --> 01:30:37,607
And I’ll submit it today

1144
01:30:39,648 --> 01:30:43,898
To be honest, your version of love
is correct in this world

1145
01:30:44,107 --> 01:30:46,273
Thesis which I have written
is only to study

1146
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:52,107
Love is bullshit

1147
01:30:54,898 --> 01:30:58,815
Do you know what we girls expect
before falling in love?

1148
01:31:01,107 --> 01:31:01,982
Status!

1149
01:31:03,482 --> 01:31:04,065
Position!

1150
01:31:06,898 --> 01:31:09,440
Do you have all this?
Do you?!

1151
01:31:09,982 --> 01:31:10,732
Damn it!

1152
01:31:11,690 --> 01:31:15,732
Sitting in a Ferrari car
With four bouncers

1153
01:31:16,107 --> 01:31:18,232
Wearing a branded tuxedo suit

1154
01:31:18,523 --> 01:31:22,523
Waving one single rose is enough

1155
01:31:22,898 --> 01:31:24,857
Girls will surrender

1156
01:31:25,190 --> 01:31:27,190
That is manhood

1157
01:31:29,232 --> 01:31:33,148
You say I love you
holding some crappy roses

1158
01:31:33,648 --> 01:31:35,857
Hell with men’s life

1159
01:31:37,482 --> 01:31:38,607
Love it seems

1160
01:33:57,982 --> 01:33:59,773
Come on darling
Come

1161
01:34:05,648 --> 01:34:07,857
Come lets go
what happened?

1162
01:34:08,232 --> 01:34:08,982
Why?
Come darling

1163
01:34:09,607 --> 01:34:11,357
Come, I will tell you later
You sit inside fast

1164
01:34:11,940 --> 01:34:13,190
Driver, please lets move

1165
01:34:15,982 --> 01:34:16,857
Driver move the car

1166
01:34:16,940 --> 01:34:18,565
Hello
Hi

1167
01:34:20,482 --> 01:34:22,940
Please forget the incident Sir

1168
01:34:23,357 --> 01:34:25,148
Please forgive me Sir

1169
01:34:27,565 --> 01:34:29,565
Who is this beautiful girl?

1170
01:34:29,857 --> 01:34:31,732
She is my would be Sir
My fiancé

1171
01:34:31,940 --> 01:34:33,607
Oh would be
Fiancé?

1172
01:34:36,398 --> 01:34:38,565
Wow, such a wonderful car!

1173
01:34:40,148 --> 01:34:40,940
What is the cost of this car?

1174
01:34:41,607 --> 01:34:42,315
Five crores Sir

1175
01:34:42,732 --> 01:34:43,023
What?!

1176
01:34:43,357 --> 01:34:44,190
Five... Five crores Sir

1177
01:34:44,398 --> 01:34:45,440
Five crores?!

1178
01:34:48,023 --> 01:34:49,232
What do you do for a living?

1179
01:34:49,357 --> 01:34:51,648
This is not mine Sir
This is my dad’s

1180
01:34:52,190 --> 01:34:53,273
Your dad’s?
Yes Sir

1181
01:34:53,773 --> 01:34:55,190
This is not yours!

1182
01:34:57,898 --> 01:34:58,940
That’s what I was wondering

1183
01:34:59,148 --> 01:35:03,315
How can this jobless fellow
 own such a car?!

1184
01:35:04,315 --> 01:35:06,148
Your dad owns this

1185
01:35:07,148 --> 01:35:10,232
Do you girls fall for boys
judging their status?

1186
01:35:10,732 --> 01:35:11,232
Status

1187
01:35:12,732 --> 01:35:15,023
First of all this status is not
earned by him

1188
01:35:15,065 --> 01:35:16,523
His father has earned this

1189
01:35:17,482 --> 01:35:20,107
You should fall for his father
Why did you fall for him?

1190
01:35:20,982 --> 01:35:22,023
Full confusion

1191
01:35:23,398 --> 01:35:24,732
You know how you girls are?

1192
01:35:25,148 --> 01:35:27,357
They go by status and not the character

1193
01:35:28,773 --> 01:35:30,690
Those who have status
will not have character

1194
01:35:31,148 --> 01:35:33,065
Those who have character
will not have status

1195
01:35:33,523 --> 01:35:35,982
You want character or status?

1196
01:35:36,440 --> 01:35:37,190
Sir, please Sir

1197
01:35:39,398 --> 01:35:41,565
You want character or status?

1198
01:35:42,857 --> 01:35:43,982
Answer me

1199
01:35:44,023 --> 01:35:45,773
Character
Character right?

1200
01:35:45,940 --> 01:35:47,648
Get down
You get down immediately

1201
01:35:47,732 --> 01:35:50,773
If you speak a word
I’ll reveal your true character

1202
01:35:53,773 --> 01:35:54,648
Status!

1203
01:35:56,732 --> 01:35:58,232
You are still here?!

1204
01:35:59,148 --> 01:36:02,357
Do you still need status?
Didn’t you get what I said?

1205
01:36:03,107 --> 01:36:05,357
Love someone who has a charter

1206
01:36:06,190 --> 01:36:08,190
Status wont lost for long

1207
01:36:08,190 --> 01:36:09,065
Get going

1208
01:36:09,732 --> 01:36:10,815
She is still standing here!

1209
01:36:11,023 --> 01:36:12,232
It's the car value

1210
01:36:12,898 --> 01:36:16,607
If my dad had earned a status
I would have got my girl

1211
01:36:17,398 --> 01:36:19,732
Its all time! Fate!

1212
01:36:40,815 --> 01:36:42,690
Dad, he is the one

1213
01:37:11,315 --> 01:37:12,232
Hey you bloody beggar!

1214
01:37:12,565 --> 01:37:13,815
You told my son's girlfriend that

1215
01:37:14,898 --> 01:37:17,607
the status he has is earned by his dad

1216
01:37:18,023 --> 01:37:19,398
so get married to him

1217
01:37:21,398 --> 01:37:25,607
I've earned status for my son
grandson and for coming generations

1218
01:37:25,940 --> 01:37:26,648
So what!

1219
01:37:27,440 --> 01:37:29,023
We are kings

1220
01:37:29,732 --> 01:37:31,232
you are a bloody local

1221
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:34,690
Show our status to him

1222
01:38:58,523 --> 01:39:03,607
Your three generation worth of status
Can’t even touch my cap

1223
01:39:08,732 --> 01:39:11,648
Love resides in every living creatures

1224
01:39:21,690 --> 01:39:27,232
The significance of the essay
written on Love by Dharmika is

1225
01:39:27,732 --> 01:39:34,315
She selected an eccentric person
for her study

1226
01:39:34,940 --> 01:39:37,732
Has written an essay and won a gold medal

1227
01:39:55,732 --> 01:39:56,273
LD

1228
01:40:28,690 --> 01:40:31,815
Please give my job to my son

1229
01:40:46,469 --> 01:40:46,886
Santhosh

1230
01:40:48,136 --> 01:40:48,344
take it

1231
01:40:49,636 --> 01:40:50,553
this is your appointment letter

1232
01:40:52,511 --> 01:40:56,344
Your dad gave you life
to bring you to this earth

1233
01:40:57,594 --> 01:41:01,344
To provide a status
your dad sacrificed his life

1234
01:41:18,761 --> 01:41:19,178
Dad

1235
01:41:20,761 --> 01:41:26,261
I'll never build by life on your grave

1236
01:41:53,678 --> 01:41:54,428
I am sorry

1237
01:41:56,636 --> 01:41:57,928
After bearing so much pain

1238
01:41:59,219 --> 01:42:00,428
You attained success

1239
01:42:02,303 --> 01:42:02,803
Really

1240
01:42:05,136 --> 01:42:05,886
you are great

1241
01:42:13,053 --> 01:42:15,178
I didn't see anything
I don't know anything

1242
01:42:15,719 --> 01:42:17,636
I just came here to serve you coffee

1243
01:42:20,844 --> 01:42:23,303
I am leaving now
you carry on

1244
01:42:24,053 --> 01:42:25,678
Probably he's done with batting by now

1245
01:42:26,053 --> 01:42:27,428
Love and lust

1246
01:42:29,136 --> 01:42:31,511
Are the drama played by him

1247
01:43:44,886 --> 01:43:48,386
You spoke to me and vanished

1248
01:43:49,428 --> 01:43:52,136
I waited for you

1249
01:43:52,969 --> 01:43:54,428
Come close to me

1250
01:43:54,969 --> 01:43:56,303
stand in front of me

1251
01:43:57,553 --> 01:43:59,511
Make love to me

1252
01:44:01,428 --> 01:44:03,594
Make love to me

1253
01:44:24,969 --> 01:44:28,469
You spoke to me and vanished

1254
01:44:29,386 --> 01:44:31,469
I waited for you

1255
01:44:33,011 --> 01:44:34,344
Come close to me

1256
01:44:35,011 --> 01:44:36,469
stand in front of me

1257
01:44:37,511 --> 01:44:39,469
Make love to me

1258
01:44:39,969 --> 01:44:43,219
O dear make love to me

1259
01:45:27,594 --> 01:45:30,886
More than Rambhe who
is made up of gold

1260
01:45:31,594 --> 01:45:34,678
he granted you more colours to you

1261
01:45:35,678 --> 01:45:41,178
He brought you to Earth
and granted you to me

1262
01:45:43,594 --> 01:45:46,678
Combining all the beauty

1263
01:45:47,594 --> 01:45:50,761
created you with love

1264
01:45:51,719 --> 01:45:57,178
Aesthetic Brahma created you

1265
01:45:58,928 --> 01:46:05,761
Creating your body with spirit
is a miracle

1266
01:46:07,011 --> 01:46:13,303
I am afraid
what if I hurt your lips

1267
01:46:13,928 --> 01:46:17,053
Surrender yourself to me

1268
01:46:18,886 --> 01:46:22,678
You spoke to me and vanished

1269
01:46:23,428 --> 01:46:25,594
I waited for you

1270
01:46:27,011 --> 01:46:28,261
Come close to me

1271
01:46:29,011 --> 01:46:30,428
stand in front of me

1272
01:46:31,469 --> 01:46:33,428
make love to me

1273
01:46:33,969 --> 01:46:37,219
O dear make love to me

1274
01:46:55,636 --> 01:46:58,553
For your body glow

1275
01:46:59,553 --> 01:47:02,636
For your long beautiful hair

1276
01:47:03,719 --> 01:47:09,219
I became fan of your dimples

1277
01:47:11,761 --> 01:47:18,678
Your arms are my bed for
the desires which rose in me

1278
01:47:19,678 --> 01:47:25,303
let’s commit a mistake
give me permission

1279
01:47:30,969 --> 01:47:33,803
You blow the Shanka of love

1280
01:47:34,928 --> 01:47:37,928
I am a born aesthetic

1281
01:47:39,303 --> 01:47:41,303
I’ll give you pleasure

1282
01:47:41,761 --> 01:47:45,261
you drink the juice of pleasure

1283
01:47:54,969 --> 01:48:01,136
let’s borrow each other’s body
an inch after an inch

1284
01:48:02,011 --> 01:48:05,511
Let’s loot each other

1285
01:48:13,219 --> 01:48:16,761
Hello.. what?
Are you dreaming?

1286
01:48:20,844 --> 01:48:22,094
Thank you so much Santhu

1287
01:48:27,386 --> 01:48:27,886
Mom

1288
01:48:30,303 --> 01:48:33,928
Dad told us not to wait

1289
01:48:35,678 --> 01:48:37,886
Will not dad come home?

1290
01:48:48,761 --> 01:48:51,928
The proposal I made with roses
got rejected that day

1291
01:48:53,053 --> 01:48:57,886
The proposal which I make now with this diamond ring
Will not get rejected by any chance

1292
01:49:17,594 --> 01:49:19,219
We have only three minutes left

1293
01:49:20,094 --> 01:49:20,636
Talk to me

1294
01:49:21,178 --> 01:49:22,844
To express my heart

1295
01:49:24,303 --> 01:49:25,053
Not just three minutes

1296
01:49:26,719 --> 01:49:28,261
three lives are not enough

1297
01:49:40,678 --> 01:49:41,178
Give me your hand

1298
01:49:54,178 --> 01:49:55,053
Your marriage?!

1299
01:50:01,136 --> 01:50:04,469
My heart got married to you
many years ago, Dharmika

1300
01:50:05,719 --> 01:50:07,011
Society?

1301
01:50:08,386 --> 01:50:09,969
Are you afraid of the society?

1302
01:50:13,011 --> 01:50:15,344
Tell me honestly
are you afraid of this society?

1303
01:50:59,761 --> 01:51:00,761
I love you, Dharmika

1304
01:51:02,511 --> 01:51:03,219
Do you love me?

1305
01:51:05,636 --> 01:51:06,303
I love you too

1306
01:51:06,803 --> 01:51:08,094
Santhu

1307
01:51:09,219 --> 01:51:10,053
are you day dreaming?

1308
01:51:10,469 --> 01:51:12,678
Your position has changed
but not you

1309
01:51:20,553 --> 01:51:21,344
That person

1310
01:51:21,344 --> 01:51:21,886
My husband

1311
01:51:24,761 --> 01:51:25,261
Excuse me

1312
01:51:26,928 --> 01:51:28,594
Hello.. yeah tell me

1313
01:51:30,511 --> 01:51:32,844
He is going to his girlfriend
to propose the first time

1314
01:51:33,219 --> 01:51:35,303
She should instantly say yes
by seeing the flowers

1315
01:51:35,428 --> 01:51:35,844
Give such flowers

1316
01:51:35,969 --> 01:51:38,219
You are taking flowers
to the girl you love

1317
01:51:38,428 --> 01:51:40,761
The girl who likes me
likes fish a lot

1318
01:51:41,053 --> 01:51:42,219
so I am taking fishes

1319
01:51:42,594 --> 01:51:44,594
God has prewritten in fate
match of every pair

1320
01:51:45,344 --> 01:51:50,928
But we go haywire
by falling behind girls

1321
01:51:57,553 --> 01:51:58,219
Look Santhu

1322
01:51:59,761 --> 01:52:01,303
I told him not to
disturb me for three hours

1323
01:52:02,303 --> 01:52:06,428
I am going to meet a friend who
loved me madly for three years

1324
01:52:09,094 --> 01:52:12,886
He didn't disturb me by calling
in this three hours

1325
01:52:15,761 --> 01:52:18,178
What a gentleman he is?!
My husband!

1326
01:52:22,761 --> 01:52:23,844
I love my husband

1327
01:52:27,136 --> 01:52:28,886
Why are you staring like this?

1328
01:52:32,178 --> 01:52:33,386
Oh because my husband is bald?!

1329
01:52:37,303 --> 01:52:43,386
When a wife asks her husband that
she's going to meet the person who loved her

1330
01:52:43,928 --> 01:52:48,594
Without being skeptical
he dropped me here

1331
01:52:50,261 --> 01:52:52,678
Isn't he a great person?
My husband

1332
01:52:53,761 --> 01:52:54,678
Not just seven lives

1333
01:52:55,636 --> 01:52:59,928
I want him to be my husband
for seven hundred years

1334
01:53:06,928 --> 01:53:08,053
I love hm so much

1335
01:53:21,428 --> 01:53:21,928
Santhu

1336
01:53:24,636 --> 01:53:25,594
In college days

1337
01:53:26,969 --> 01:53:29,969
You used to bug me
in the name of love with a flower in hand

1338
01:53:32,803 --> 01:53:34,344
But today, I have come to you

1339
01:53:40,386 --> 01:53:41,011
Where is the rose?

1340
01:53:45,261 --> 01:53:46,219
Wont give me a rose?

1341
01:53:56,969 --> 01:53:57,886
Give me a red rose bouquet

1342
01:53:58,594 --> 01:54:00,178
I made it specially for lovers

1343
01:54:00,594 --> 01:54:02,219
Is it for your lover?

1344
01:54:02,969 --> 01:54:03,803
Give it to her Sir

1345
01:54:04,511 --> 01:54:05,053
Sir change?!

1346
01:54:23,719 --> 01:54:24,844
After many years

1347
01:54:26,011 --> 01:54:29,511
I am giving roses to someone

1348
01:54:31,303 --> 01:54:35,261
Whenever I felt love

1349
01:54:36,928 --> 01:54:38,594
I used to express
it through these flowers

1350
01:54:40,636 --> 01:54:44,719
But, it was never accepted

1351
01:54:47,094 --> 01:54:47,511
But today

1352
01:54:49,761 --> 01:54:50,511
Will you forgive me

1353
01:54:53,386 --> 01:54:56,261
and accept this today?

1354
01:55:04,636 --> 01:55:05,136
Gowri

1355
01:55:10,344 --> 01:55:11,178
Gowri

1356
01:55:19,969 --> 01:55:20,761
I love you

1357
01:55:50,136 --> 01:55:51,303
Will prepare a cup of coffee

1358
01:56:04,761 --> 01:56:05,386
You bloody

1359
01:56:05,928 --> 01:56:09,969
Did you give flowers to your wife
and said I love you?!

1360
01:56:10,636 --> 01:56:13,136
You bloody.
all men are same

1361
01:56:13,928 --> 01:56:16,094
Seeing the way you left

1362
01:56:16,469 --> 01:56:21,053
I was waiting for you to come
and give flowers

1363
01:56:21,886 --> 01:56:22,469
Leave it

1364
01:56:23,011 --> 01:56:24,678
Santhu you know what

1365
01:56:25,386 --> 01:56:29,594
Actually, your wife is the reason
for me to meet you

1366
01:56:35,803 --> 01:56:36,428
Dharmika

1367
01:56:39,844 --> 01:56:40,678
Dharmika

1368
01:56:44,386 --> 01:56:46,928
Yes.. He was in love with Dharmika

1369
01:56:47,594 --> 01:56:48,803
Can I have her number please?

1370
01:56:49,219 --> 01:56:52,511
My husband is murmuring
your name in his dreams

1371
01:56:53,761 --> 01:56:58,511
Can you please meet him once?

1372
01:56:59,428 --> 01:57:00,344
A great wife she is

1373
01:57:01,219 --> 01:57:06,844
Which wife will ask a girl to meet
who was loved by her husband?

1374
01:57:07,761 --> 01:57:08,886
More than her happiness

1375
01:57:09,594 --> 01:57:11,136
she cares for her husband's happiness

1376
01:57:11,969 --> 01:57:13,136
If I were with you

1377
01:57:13,844 --> 01:57:15,886
I don't know whether
you would have been happy or not

1378
01:57:16,553 --> 01:57:20,719
But you are lucky to have her
as your wife

1379
01:57:21,886 --> 01:57:24,344
Anyway Santhu
All the best

1380
01:57:28,261 --> 01:57:28,636
Coffee

1381
01:57:45,511 --> 01:57:50,261
I am giving this ring to
the priceless person in this world

1382
01:57:59,428 --> 01:58:00,344
Not for just seven lives,

1383
01:58:01,886 --> 01:58:05,303
you are my wife for
seven hundred lives to come

1384
01:58:06,428 --> 01:58:09,594
You are my life, you are my love

1385
01:58:12,761 --> 01:58:13,594
I love you
