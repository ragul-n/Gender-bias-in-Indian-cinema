1
00:00:18,424 --> 00:00:20,392
These children as
innocent as flowers...

2
00:00:20,826 --> 00:00:23,727
... are searching their
future in this dirty drain.

3
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:26,388
And this is the place,...

4
00:00:26,832 --> 00:00:29,892
... where lakhs of innocent
people are born in poverty...

5
00:00:30,102 --> 00:00:32,400
... and the poison of hunger
and unemployment...

6
00:00:32,505 --> 00:00:34,803
... compels them to
become criminals!

7
00:00:36,842 --> 00:00:39,402
This story is about an
innocent boy whose name is...

8
00:00:39,845 --> 00:00:40,812
Mangal...

9
00:00:42,114 --> 00:00:45,208
... how come you are early today?

10
00:00:45,851 --> 00:00:47,853
- Mother..
- What happened?

11
00:00:47,853 --> 00:00:50,754
- l got expelled from school.
- Expelled?

12
00:00:50,856 --> 00:00:53,416
Don't you worry.
l was anyway going to work...

13
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:54,960
... and l've already found one.

14
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,091
And the doctor also said that
you need food and not medicines.

15
00:01:00,466 --> 00:01:03,969
lf you eat well you
will become absolutely fit.

16
00:01:03,969 --> 00:01:06,096
- lsn't it, mother?
- Go, my son...

17
00:01:06,472 --> 00:01:08,641
... l have kept a 'roti'
for you, eat it.

18
00:01:08,641 --> 00:01:09,835
Okay, mother.

19
00:01:20,486 --> 00:01:21,851
Mother!

20
00:01:21,987 --> 00:01:23,489
- Did you eat?
- Yes, son.

21
00:01:23,489 --> 00:01:24,854
l did.

22
00:01:28,494 --> 00:01:30,962
Mother, you are lying.
Swear by me.

23
00:01:35,501 --> 00:01:38,504
We shall share and eat.

24
00:01:38,504 --> 00:01:40,631
l'll just get it.

25
00:01:53,919 --> 00:01:56,479
Listen O' Lord l'm going
to fetch food for mother.

26
00:01:57,122 --> 00:02:01,650
Look after her. As many as l get
l'll distribute half in your name.

27
00:02:16,942 --> 00:02:18,944
- Sir, money.
- What money?

28
00:02:18,944 --> 00:02:21,139
You told me that you'd
give me. Mother is hungry.

29
00:02:21,213 --> 00:02:23,181
Get lost.

30
00:02:41,567 --> 00:02:45,025
Hey, this is not your
cup of tea get going.

31
00:02:45,237 --> 00:02:47,865
Eat food, become healthy
then come here. Go!

32
00:02:48,073 --> 00:02:50,200
Only if l work l'll get to eat.

33
00:02:50,376 --> 00:02:53,539
And only if l eat l'll
become healthy. Let me work.

34
00:02:53,612 --> 00:02:56,206
lf you die who will be
responsible? Get lost!

35
00:03:56,642 --> 00:03:58,940
Stealing! Will your father
pay for this broken glass?

36
00:04:11,657 --> 00:04:14,125
Add the damage in my bill.

37
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:17,026
Eat my son.

38
00:04:17,663 --> 00:04:19,028
No, Sir.

39
00:04:19,665 --> 00:04:21,266
Only one 'roti' for mother.

40
00:04:21,266 --> 00:04:22,668
Mother! Mother!

41
00:04:22,668 --> 00:04:25,637
Look how many 'roti's'
l brought for you.

42
00:04:28,674 --> 00:04:31,040
Mother.

43
00:04:31,176 --> 00:04:32,643
Mother!
Hey Mother!

44
00:04:33,679 --> 00:04:35,044
Mother!

45
00:04:35,681 --> 00:04:39,084
No, mother!
Don't leave me and go.

46
00:04:39,084 --> 00:04:41,314
Don't leave me.

47
00:04:51,096 --> 00:04:52,654
Here!

48
00:04:53,365 --> 00:04:56,368
Take all this,
but return my mother to me.

49
00:04:56,368 --> 00:04:59,667
Return my mother, otherwise.

50
00:05:00,038 --> 00:05:03,709
What will He do?
Who is He?

51
00:05:03,709 --> 00:05:05,677
Your mother died of hunger.

52
00:05:06,111 --> 00:05:10,070
Come with me.l'll teach
you the style of living...

53
00:05:10,716 --> 00:05:13,344
From today, hunger will
not even touch your shadow.

54
00:05:14,119 --> 00:05:15,677
Come with me.

55
00:05:45,751 --> 00:05:48,117
You go from here,
we'll come from behind.

56
00:08:00,886 --> 00:08:04,890
Count the goods
for your satisfaction.

57
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:07,225
Had someone else got it
l would've surely counted.

58
00:08:07,225 --> 00:08:10,854
lt is not wise to trust anybody
in smuggling and illegal business.

59
00:08:11,897 --> 00:08:13,899
l have complete trust in you.

60
00:08:13,899 --> 00:08:17,357
Because you do illegal
work very honestly.

61
00:08:20,906 --> 00:08:23,909
The intoxication l get
in eating two 'rotis'...

62
00:08:23,909 --> 00:08:26,878
... perhaps you won't get it,
even after consuming two bottles.

63
00:08:30,549 --> 00:08:31,880
l've got fed up of this life
give me my share.

64
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:35,686
l'll start a small hotel.

65
00:08:35,921 --> 00:08:38,890
Where the rich and the poor
and all class of people...

66
00:08:39,324 --> 00:08:41,727
... can eat to their
hearts content.

67
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:45,931
Those who have money and
even those who don't have.

68
00:08:45,931 --> 00:08:50,698
So that no poor boy turns Mangal
for a piece of 'roti'.

69
00:08:50,936 --> 00:08:53,905
Mangal is born in
every situation.

70
00:08:54,339 --> 00:08:56,942
l worked so hard on you...

71
00:08:56,942 --> 00:09:01,709
... taught you so many things,
only to leave me and start a hotel?

72
00:09:03,949 --> 00:09:06,952
You can't leave this
business now.

73
00:09:06,952 --> 00:09:10,911
Because after me you have
to handle the enter show.

74
00:09:11,957 --> 00:09:14,425
Right? Now sit and eat.

75
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,588
No, l can't digest this food.

76
00:09:17,963 --> 00:09:19,590
Why? What is wrong in it?

77
00:09:19,765 --> 00:09:22,134
Nothing, it is my stomach.

78
00:09:22,134 --> 00:09:24,432
lt have got used to
eating dry rotis.

79
00:09:24,569 --> 00:09:28,733
You eat l'll go.
My dinner must be waiting for me.

80
00:09:30,976 --> 00:09:33,342
Give.

81
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,107
l'll eat this.

82
00:09:37,382 --> 00:09:39,384
Sir, had you come earlier
l would've given to you.

83
00:09:39,384 --> 00:09:41,750
Now it's Mangal's, so bad luck.

84
00:09:41,987 --> 00:09:44,956
lf Mangal wants it then first
he'll have to fight me.

85
00:09:45,991 --> 00:09:50,395
My friend, l've come to
fill my stomach, not fight.

86
00:09:50,395 --> 00:09:52,556
And why fight for
a single 'roti'?

87
00:09:52,664 --> 00:09:55,633
Even our government says
there's shortage of grains.

88
00:09:55,801 --> 00:09:58,634
- ... ''share and eat''
- Excellent!

89
00:09:58,804 --> 00:10:02,968
l have never left any
work half done, my boy.

90
00:10:03,075 --> 00:10:06,374
My friend, neither
have l till date.

91
00:10:07,012 --> 00:10:09,776
You looked hungry, hence
l was giving you half of it.

92
00:10:10,015 --> 00:10:13,781
l'll eat the enter thing.
My intentions are always firm.

93
00:10:14,019 --> 00:10:16,021
Ask this boy.

94
00:10:16,021 --> 00:10:17,522
Mangal, let him take this.

95
00:10:17,522 --> 00:10:20,025
l'll prepare hot rotis
for you at home.

96
00:10:20,025 --> 00:10:23,028
The matter has become
very hot here.

97
00:10:23,028 --> 00:10:26,794
Now it won't be decided at home,
but here in the market!

98
00:10:28,033 --> 00:10:30,797
Now it is a matter of my honour.

99
00:10:31,036 --> 00:10:35,496
- l asked for it first, hence
l'll eat it. - You've the guts?

100
00:10:35,707 --> 00:10:37,800
- Shall l show you?
- Yes!

101
00:10:38,443 --> 00:10:43,048
Keep this in the centre of the
road,we'll walk ten steps behind.

102
00:10:43,048 --> 00:10:45,016
One who snatches it first,
shall have it.

103
00:10:47,052 --> 00:10:48,417
Done!

104
00:10:49,054 --> 00:10:51,022
Hey my friend, wait.

105
00:10:51,456 --> 00:10:54,516
The fight is for this 'roti'
and you're keeping it on the ground?

106
00:11:01,066 --> 00:11:04,433
Respect it my friend,
ultimately l'll only eat it.

107
00:11:04,569 --> 00:11:06,036
That we'll know very soon.

108
00:13:39,224 --> 00:13:41,226
This man who is standing
in the witness box...

109
00:13:41,226 --> 00:13:43,194
... whose hands
are stained with blood...

110
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:47,197
... whose habit is breaking law
and who is a criminal.

111
00:13:47,299 --> 00:13:49,401
... should be punished
so severely...

112
00:13:49,401 --> 00:13:51,198
... that even death should tremor.

113
00:13:51,303 --> 00:13:53,999
So that no one dares
becomes, Mangal!

114
00:13:54,239 --> 00:13:57,642
Mangal will be born under
every circumstances, lawyer!

115
00:13:57,642 --> 00:14:02,204
Till helpless poor mothers continues
dying on the streets due to hunger.

116
00:14:02,914 --> 00:14:06,651
Till innocent children are
raised in unhealthy environment.

117
00:14:06,651 --> 00:14:10,922
And till devils take advantage
of these innocent children...

118
00:14:10,922 --> 00:14:13,758
... and compel them
to become criminals.

119
00:14:13,758 --> 00:14:20,027
You'll find Mangal in every nook
and corner of the streets!

120
00:14:20,265 --> 00:14:22,893
He is right.

121
00:14:23,668 --> 00:14:26,671
My lord....

122
00:14:26,671 --> 00:14:31,904
... if you want to eradicate crime
from the face of this society...

123
00:14:32,677 --> 00:14:34,235
...then first put an end
to those sadists...

124
00:14:34,346 --> 00:14:36,246
... who take advantage of
poor people's humanity...

125
00:14:36,348 --> 00:14:39,249
... and sow the seeds of
crime in their hearts.

126
00:14:39,617 --> 00:14:41,953
They raise them under
the shadow of crime...

127
00:14:41,953 --> 00:14:44,251
... and compel them
to become murderers.

128
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:48,921
Ultimately that innocent,
helpless person...

129
00:14:49,694 --> 00:14:54,299
... becomes on outlaw
in the eyes of the society.

130
00:14:54,299 --> 00:14:56,701
Put an end to those devils!

131
00:14:56,701 --> 00:15:00,262
killing one Mangal
won't make any difference.

132
00:15:01,306 --> 00:15:02,773
My lord.

133
00:15:03,308 --> 00:15:07,870
l have committed the crime, the
evidences have reached the court.

134
00:15:07,979 --> 00:15:11,073
Your pen is anxious
to sign my death sentence.

135
00:15:11,316 --> 00:15:13,944
Please read out your verdict.

136
00:15:14,319 --> 00:15:15,286
But...

137
00:15:16,321 --> 00:15:18,687
... but before going
l'll tell you...

138
00:15:19,324 --> 00:15:22,623
''The fault is not mine,
l swear by food...''

139
00:15:22,727 --> 00:15:25,958
...'' in this world of hunger,
fidelity wavers.''

140
00:15:31,336 --> 00:15:34,305
Mangal, the court
sympathises with you.

141
00:15:34,739 --> 00:15:37,342
But all the evidences
are against you.

142
00:15:37,342 --> 00:15:41,346
Hence keeping in mind all
the evidences and witnesses...

143
00:15:41,346 --> 00:15:44,315
... the court sentences you
to death punishment.

144
00:16:09,774 --> 00:16:12,377
Here is your last wish.

145
00:16:12,377 --> 00:16:18,338
Not only mine, this roti
is everyone's first and last wish.

146
00:16:18,783 --> 00:16:21,386
This 'roti' is a miraculous thing.

147
00:16:21,386 --> 00:16:23,888
l became a convict for
the sake of 'roti'.

148
00:16:23,888 --> 00:16:26,686
You became a jailer for
the sake of 'roti', isn't it?

149
00:16:48,413 --> 00:16:50,415
Where are you taking this 'roti'?

150
00:16:50,415 --> 00:16:53,418
- Up!
- Up? - My friend.

151
00:16:53,418 --> 00:16:55,716
... suppose l don't get it there?

152
00:17:03,428 --> 00:17:06,397
Oh lovely!

153
00:17:07,432 --> 00:17:10,401
My farewell has been
very well arranged.

154
00:17:10,502 --> 00:17:13,771
So many big
personalities have come.

155
00:17:13,771 --> 00:17:18,731
And the D.C.P too?
But there's one thing missing.

156
00:17:18,943 --> 00:17:19,910
What?

157
00:17:20,512 --> 00:17:23,413
A helicopter to go up.

158
00:17:24,449 --> 00:17:25,850
Well, that will be arranged for.

159
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:29,217
Stop joking, and
think about the lord.

160
00:17:29,521 --> 00:17:32,081
- Your death is near.
- Mr.superintendent.

161
00:17:32,457 --> 00:17:36,461
l was born on Tuesday
got caught on Tuesday...

162
00:17:36,461 --> 00:17:38,759
... and was sentenced
on Tuesday itself.

163
00:17:38,863 --> 00:17:42,094
Hence l'll die on Tuesday.

164
00:17:42,467 --> 00:17:46,767
But today...is not
Tuesday but Monday.

165
00:17:47,472 --> 00:17:50,771
Do you still think you
will succeed in escaping?

166
00:17:51,476 --> 00:17:52,875
Mr.D.S.P.

167
00:17:53,545 --> 00:17:58,448
Till today, no noose has been made
that can fit around Mangals neck.

168
00:18:17,502 --> 00:18:21,802
Hey, god of death!
Look, here is my helicopter.

169
00:19:57,602 --> 00:20:00,901
Mr.D.S.P, don't follow me.

170
00:20:01,239 --> 00:20:05,073
lt shouldn't happen that in the
bargain, you land up in hell.

171
00:21:30,027 --> 00:21:33,698
l think, Mangal is dead.

172
00:21:33,698 --> 00:21:35,063
Come on.

173
00:21:38,002 --> 00:21:40,994
ln the eyes of the police,
Mangal the murderer is dead.

174
00:21:41,105 --> 00:21:44,165
Today a new Mangal will be born.

175
00:22:03,728 --> 00:22:07,732
Oh, so even you are here?
lt appears l was being awaited for?

176
00:22:07,732 --> 00:22:10,200
Why this distance?

177
00:22:10,368 --> 00:22:12,495
Okay, l'll raise the curtain.

178
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:20,040
The moment l touch you,
somebody will surely intervene.

179
00:22:22,747 --> 00:22:24,112
Saw?

180
00:22:27,752 --> 00:22:29,720
Looks like you are very hungry.

181
00:22:30,755 --> 00:22:33,424
- Go ahead.
- You ordered it, you eat.

182
00:22:33,424 --> 00:22:35,760
What difference does
that make, brother?

183
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,728
The one who is destined
for it will eat it.

184
00:22:38,162 --> 00:22:41,859
lt is said, ''Each morsel
has a person's name written on it.''

185
00:22:41,933 --> 00:22:44,268
You are talking about yore years.

186
00:22:44,268 --> 00:22:48,068
ln today's world, two people
have to share a single morsel.

187
00:22:49,774 --> 00:22:52,402
Possibly we both are
destined to eat this.

188
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:54,278
- Possibly.
- Then start.

189
00:22:54,278 --> 00:22:57,736
- Sure.
- Yes, eat. - Thank you.

190
00:22:57,949 --> 00:22:59,814
- What is your name?
- Name?

191
00:23:01,786 --> 00:23:06,223
You are getting scared as
if you have committed a murder.

192
00:23:06,791 --> 00:23:08,459
What is in a name?

193
00:23:08,459 --> 00:23:10,294
A man is known by his deeds.

194
00:23:10,294 --> 00:23:12,762
Some people name themselves
as, Suraj, (Sun)...

195
00:23:12,864 --> 00:23:15,560
... but only spread darkness
in the world.

196
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,259
You appear to be a philosopher.

197
00:23:18,803 --> 00:23:22,102
- Where do you belong to?
- To this world!

198
00:23:22,206 --> 00:23:24,766
- Where are you going?
- Where fate takes me.

199
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:29,577
You talk in riddles.
Hope you are not in the police?

200
00:23:32,216 --> 00:23:35,447
No, l was but not now.

201
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,447
Why did you leave?

202
00:23:37,622 --> 00:23:42,787
They were not ready to leave me,
l left with great difficulty.

203
00:24:07,251 --> 00:24:11,620
Hey, he didn't get water
l'll order it.

204
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,663
You are a convict!
A fugitive!

205
00:24:18,663 --> 00:24:21,632
lf you are scared of me,
then l'll go.

206
00:24:21,866 --> 00:24:25,825
Abetting criminals and committing
a crime, is in itself a crime.

207
00:24:25,937 --> 00:24:30,169
My friend, don't compel me
to become ungrateful.

208
00:26:10,975 --> 00:26:13,273
- Where is your father?
- Gone to the market.

209
00:26:19,984 --> 00:26:21,451
My friend.

210
00:26:21,986 --> 00:26:24,454
Can you cut this?

211
00:26:24,989 --> 00:26:27,617
- l'm a blacksmith's son
why can't l? - Bravo, cut!

212
00:26:29,994 --> 00:26:31,359
Handcuffs?

213
00:26:31,996 --> 00:26:35,454
Not handcuffs, only cuffs.
Come on cut.

214
00:26:57,021 --> 00:26:58,989
Bravo!

215
00:27:00,024 --> 00:27:01,389
See you soon!

216
00:27:11,035 --> 00:27:12,400
lmpossible!

217
00:27:13,037 --> 00:27:15,505
Mangal cannot die so easily.

218
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:19,339
He has not only fooled the police,
but all of us too.

219
00:27:21,445 --> 00:27:23,345
l'll see...

220
00:27:23,447 --> 00:27:25,049
... how far he goes!

221
00:27:25,049 --> 00:27:26,676
Let him go, Sir.

222
00:27:26,851 --> 00:27:28,682
- lf you wish you can make
anyone Mangal. - No!

223
00:27:29,353 --> 00:27:32,015
Mangal has deceived me!

224
00:27:32,456 --> 00:27:35,516
My cat purrs at me!

225
00:27:36,127 --> 00:27:38,027
l won't spare him!

226
00:27:52,076 --> 00:27:55,079
Hey folks, the bus will wait
half for only ten minutes.

227
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:57,377
Have tea and come back
to your seats.

228
00:28:02,086 --> 00:28:06,090
What's the matter?
Why are they stoning that girl?

229
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:09,856
Uncle, this prostitute is
ruining the entire village.

230
00:28:10,161 --> 00:28:13,062
Her staying here,
is not good for our women folk.

231
00:28:24,108 --> 00:28:27,511
Who are you to interfere?
Who is she to you?

232
00:28:27,511 --> 00:28:30,114
There is something
called humanity too.

233
00:28:30,114 --> 00:28:33,675
Hey you rascal! He also looks
like a sinner. Throw him out!

234
00:28:33,751 --> 00:28:36,686
- Beat him!
- Beat him!

235
00:28:55,139 --> 00:28:58,267
''My friends, listen to me''

236
00:28:58,475 --> 00:29:01,444
''Choose such a person...''

237
00:29:02,146 --> 00:29:08,107
''... who has not sinned or
is not a sinner''

238
00:29:44,188 --> 00:29:50,821
''Some men are clever while
some are naive''

239
00:29:59,203 --> 00:30:04,505
''We all are sinners,
some less, some more''

240
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:12,171
''Some agree while some get angry''

241
00:30:13,217 --> 00:30:18,177
''Someone is caught,
while someone goes free''

242
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:11,572
''Today all of us will
punish a sinning woman''

243
00:31:20,284 --> 00:31:25,916
'' But the one who is not a
sinner will throw the stone first''

244
00:31:28,292 --> 00:31:34,060
''First clean your own mind''

245
00:31:34,298 --> 00:31:39,600
''Then judge about other people''

246
00:32:52,376 --> 00:32:54,844
This dress looks
like that of a hero.

247
00:33:40,424 --> 00:33:42,187
Salutations, Sir!

248
00:33:42,426 --> 00:33:46,795
Look, my luggage is up,
unload it carefully, l'm very strict.

249
00:33:47,431 --> 00:33:50,127
Sir, you must be tired should
l order tea... Hey boy!

250
00:33:50,501 --> 00:33:54,062
Children drink tea,
l drink milk.

251
00:33:57,841 --> 00:34:03,404
A glass of hot milk, with
lots of cream and listen...

252
00:34:04,081 --> 00:34:07,209
lt should be very creamy,
otherwise l'll have this motel shut!

253
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,428
Hey you moustache!

254
00:34:19,463 --> 00:34:22,799
- Out with the money!
- Money? What money?

255
00:34:22,799 --> 00:34:25,233
Of the hot creamy milk.

256
00:34:25,469 --> 00:34:27,596
Half of which is in your stomach
and half on your moustache.

257
00:34:28,472 --> 00:34:31,771
You ask money from me.
When l was in Pathankot...

258
00:34:31,875 --> 00:34:35,072
- ... no one asked money from me.
- No wonder you are here.

259
00:34:35,479 --> 00:34:39,108
Hey girl!
Talk obediently. l'm very stiff.

260
00:34:39,283 --> 00:34:42,486
Why? Have you just come
from the laundry?

261
00:34:42,486 --> 00:34:46,156
Talk within your limits or
l'll put you in the lock up.

262
00:34:46,156 --> 00:34:48,492
Out with the money.

263
00:34:48,492 --> 00:34:51,461
Shut up!
How much is it?

264
00:34:52,496 --> 00:34:55,124
Ah! That's like a good boy.

265
00:34:55,499 --> 00:34:58,263
One rupee! Out with it.

266
00:34:58,569 --> 00:35:02,471
This is an expensive motel,
one rupee for a glass of milk?

267
00:35:03,507 --> 00:35:07,273
Very soon, a glass of
water will cost 75 paise.

268
00:35:07,511 --> 00:35:10,013
Besides, it was not pure milk either.

269
00:35:10,013 --> 00:35:12,481
There was 1%%% milk and 4%%% water!

270
00:35:12,649 --> 00:35:16,520
Hey Sentry!
Take down this motel's number.

271
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:22,481
Take down her parents number,
she adds cream in milk.

272
00:35:22,593 --> 00:35:24,652
Potatoes in mutton.

273
00:35:24,928 --> 00:35:29,831
Tea leaves in tea.
l say bring down her motel!

274
00:35:43,547 --> 00:35:47,050
Hey, what are you doing?
This is pure ghee!

275
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:49,018
The customer has ordered
'Parathas' made in pure ghee.

276
00:35:49,152 --> 00:35:50,517
You'll make me a bankrupt.

277
00:35:51,555 --> 00:35:54,057
Here, make parathas
out of ordinary ghee.

278
00:35:54,057 --> 00:35:56,560
And sprinkle pure ghee
on top for aroma.

279
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,324
- This is cheating.
- Cheating, my foot!

280
00:35:59,563 --> 00:36:02,065
l at least tell you
to add ordinary ghee.

281
00:36:02,065 --> 00:36:05,193
The neighbouring motel owners
add grease instead of ghee.

282
00:36:05,569 --> 00:36:09,335
Look, don't touch the ghee
tin without my permission.

283
00:36:09,573 --> 00:36:11,040
lt will work for another five years.

284
00:36:11,575 --> 00:36:14,043
And one more thing...

285
00:36:14,578 --> 00:36:17,547
Don't ever do as the customer says.

286
00:36:17,981 --> 00:36:20,250
People have got used
to eating ordinary ghee.

287
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:22,586
Try to understand.
They will get an upset stomach.

288
00:36:22,586 --> 00:36:24,213
Keep this paratha aside for me.

289
00:36:34,598 --> 00:36:38,557
Got a shock?
My name is Bijli. l give shocks!

290
00:36:39,002 --> 00:36:41,971
Hey you! couldn't you find another
motel to steal from?

291
00:36:42,606 --> 00:36:45,200
Steal? Who was here to steal?

292
00:36:45,275 --> 00:36:47,743
l only came to see whether
this 'roti' is properly cooked.

293
00:36:48,011 --> 00:36:51,071
Oh! So you were here to
supervise the motel?

294
00:36:51,615 --> 00:36:55,244
Why don't you say that
you were here to steal?

295
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:57,985
Tell me!

296
00:36:58,322 --> 00:37:00,624
- Mortgage my clothes.
- Hey...

297
00:37:00,624 --> 00:37:04,583
... l don't believe in giving debts
and mortgaging, get lost.

298
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:08,598
Keep the egg.

299
00:37:09,633 --> 00:37:10,998
Come on.

300
00:37:12,636 --> 00:37:14,604
lt is rotten anyway.

301
00:37:17,641 --> 00:37:19,939
Hey! Come here.

302
00:37:20,644 --> 00:37:22,009
Come here!

303
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:28,278
And this is for you.

304
00:37:30,654 --> 00:37:31,621
Listen.

305
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:37,327
l'm a girl and that too lonely.

306
00:37:37,327 --> 00:37:39,795
Yet l manage to earn a livelihood.

307
00:37:39,996 --> 00:37:42,123
l don't beg before anyone.

308
00:37:42,332 --> 00:37:46,291
You are a well-built man.
Aren't you ashamed of stealing?

309
00:37:57,681 --> 00:38:00,047
That does it!

310
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:01,942
First time l said something
nice to someone...

311
00:38:02,018 --> 00:38:03,645
... and he got angry.

312
00:38:03,754 --> 00:38:07,155
Go to hell, l care a damn.

313
00:38:21,705 --> 00:38:26,074
''You a well-built man,
aren't you ashamed of stealing?''

314
00:38:41,725 --> 00:38:44,091
Leave me.

315
00:38:46,129 --> 00:38:48,689
Leave me.

316
00:38:52,135 --> 00:38:57,505
First time l'm running away from
stealing and you're stopping me.

317
00:39:00,744 --> 00:39:02,746
Who is there?

318
00:39:02,746 --> 00:39:05,715
Who is it, Moti?
Who is it?!

319
00:39:09,753 --> 00:39:13,519
Why don't you speak?
l'll shoot you.

320
00:39:13,757 --> 00:39:16,521
Speak up!

321
00:39:17,761 --> 00:39:20,059
Where is my rifle?

322
00:39:20,764 --> 00:39:25,133
My rifle.

323
00:39:25,769 --> 00:39:27,464
Hey, mister!

324
00:39:27,771 --> 00:39:29,739
Who are you?

325
00:39:31,174 --> 00:39:32,732
Where is my rifle?

326
00:39:33,777 --> 00:39:36,405
Hey mister, who are you?

327
00:39:37,781 --> 00:39:39,146
l...

328
00:39:39,282 --> 00:39:41,750
- l came today itself.
- From where?

329
00:39:44,788 --> 00:39:48,246
- From the city.
- From Jalandhar? - Yes, Sir.

330
00:39:48,792 --> 00:39:53,559
- Are you my son Shravan's
friend, Ramu? - Pardon?

331
00:39:53,864 --> 00:39:56,094
Yes...Yes...l'm Ramu.

332
00:39:56,867 --> 00:39:59,392
Then son come in.

333
00:39:59,803 --> 00:40:02,205
Your dog is very faithful.

334
00:40:02,205 --> 00:40:04,105
Yes, but he cannot
recognise his own people.

335
00:40:04,441 --> 00:40:08,275
Son, tell me something,
why didn't you reply?

336
00:40:09,212 --> 00:40:12,773
Well...seeing the rifle in
your hand l had got scared.

337
00:40:13,016 --> 00:40:16,820
l thought it was a thief hence
l picked up my rifle.

338
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:21,780
Besides, Moti was also barking as
though a thief had sneaked in.

339
00:40:24,227 --> 00:40:28,129
Look, our son's friend
Ramu, is here.

340
00:40:28,465 --> 00:40:30,797
And l mistook
him to be a thief.

341
00:40:31,835 --> 00:40:34,170
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

342
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:36,297
- You think everyone is a thief.
- Now you tell me son...

343
00:40:36,506 --> 00:40:39,805
... is the character of a
person written on his face?

344
00:40:41,845 --> 00:40:44,143
Even if it is,
what difference will that make?

345
00:40:44,848 --> 00:40:46,816
Can those blind, read it?

346
00:40:49,052 --> 00:40:52,215
- You too?
- Yes, son.

347
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:59,262
First eat, then rest.

348
00:40:59,262 --> 00:41:01,364
You must be tried.

349
00:41:01,364 --> 00:41:05,323
No, mother.
You eat, l've already eaten.

350
00:41:05,502 --> 00:41:07,163
How can this be?

351
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:09,329
You have to eat two morsels
with us. Come on.

352
00:41:11,274 --> 00:41:14,175
lf you insist.

353
00:41:24,888 --> 00:41:26,515
Sir, this card.

354
00:41:40,904 --> 00:41:43,202
Mangal's finger prints match with
those of Shravan's murder case.

355
00:41:44,908 --> 00:41:46,876
Keep it in Mangal's file.

356
00:41:47,911 --> 00:41:51,278
This means Mangal is still alive!

357
00:41:52,215 --> 00:41:55,378
Re-arresting Mangal
is your responsibility.

358
00:42:01,324 --> 00:42:03,593
This is my Shravan's room.

359
00:42:03,593 --> 00:42:05,891
You rest here.

360
00:42:28,952 --> 00:42:30,920
Paul Shankar, attend to sir.

361
00:42:31,955 --> 00:42:35,413
- Salutations, Sir.
- Have you seen this man here?

362
00:42:37,961 --> 00:42:40,429
- Yes.
- Where?

363
00:42:41,598 --> 00:42:42,929
Come with me.

364
00:42:44,968 --> 00:42:46,970
- Where is Mangal?
- Who Mangal?

365
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:50,929
The one who is staying here, is a
a fugitive and not Shravan's friend.

366
00:42:57,981 --> 00:42:59,949
Don't try to run.

367
00:43:31,014 --> 00:43:32,379
You!

368
00:43:32,649 --> 00:43:35,418
Mister, is this your
father's inn...

369
00:43:35,418 --> 00:43:37,420
... that you were snorting
away to glory?

370
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:39,581
You didn't find anything in my
motel, so you sneaked in here!

371
00:43:39,689 --> 00:43:43,693
To fool the blind parents
whose son is not here, right?

372
00:43:43,693 --> 00:43:46,662
- You are getting me wrong.
- l know everything.

373
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:48,998
- What did you steal?
- Steal?

374
00:43:49,099 --> 00:43:53,001
Speak up! Otherwise l'll pluck
your eyes and give it in your hand.

375
00:43:53,436 --> 00:43:57,540
Hey girl! l'm not in the
habit of listening to threats.

376
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:01,670
Talk politely or l'll
disfigure your face understood.

377
00:44:02,445 --> 00:44:06,006
Get lost!
l have dealt with the likes of you.

378
00:44:06,116 --> 00:44:10,348
- What happened, dear?
- A thief has sneaked in. - Thief!

379
00:44:10,453 --> 00:44:14,014
- Where is he?
- This one.

380
00:44:14,124 --> 00:44:15,614
Mother, she thinks l'm a thief.

381
00:44:15,692 --> 00:44:18,228
Dear, learn to keep cool.

382
00:44:18,228 --> 00:44:21,026
You always picks up fights
with someone or the other.

383
00:44:21,131 --> 00:44:24,134
He is not a thief but
Shravan's friend, Ramu.

384
00:44:24,134 --> 00:44:27,831
What nonsense? lf someone says that
he is Shravan's friend...

385
00:44:28,071 --> 00:44:31,574
... will you let him in?
Don't blame me if anything happens.

386
00:44:31,574 --> 00:44:33,701
Then don't say
l didn't warn you.

387
00:44:35,078 --> 00:44:40,038
Son, don't mind her words
she is very talkative.

388
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:43,051
Get an extra meal from today.

389
00:44:43,153 --> 00:44:47,590
As soon as Shravan comes,
l'll clear your debts.

390
00:44:47,590 --> 00:44:52,050
Have l ever asked for money?
That you... Tell me...

391
00:44:52,162 --> 00:44:54,062
... what do l get for dinner?

392
00:44:55,498 --> 00:44:57,466
Landlord!

393
00:44:58,101 --> 00:45:01,070
- ls anyone home?
- You devil...

394
00:45:01,504 --> 00:45:03,734
... you are back?

395
00:45:04,107 --> 00:45:07,110
You shut up!
Listen blind fellow...

396
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:11,570
l've received the plan for the hotel,
vacate this house.

397
00:45:12,515 --> 00:45:16,519
Sir, l've told you many times
l don't want to sell this house.

398
00:45:16,519 --> 00:45:19,886
Then why do you trouble
us time and again?

399
00:45:21,124 --> 00:45:23,626
A hotel will
surely come up here.

400
00:45:23,626 --> 00:45:26,094
Otherwise mind you,
l'll throw you out. Come on sign!

401
00:45:26,196 --> 00:45:30,633
lf you do as l say, you'll
get the money for your house.

402
00:45:30,633 --> 00:45:32,828
Otherwise mind you,
l'll throw you out. Come on sign!

403
00:45:33,136 --> 00:45:34,637
No, Sir.

404
00:45:34,637 --> 00:45:36,139
l came here in a litter as a bride.

405
00:45:36,139 --> 00:45:39,108
Let me leave this house on a bier.

406
00:45:39,209 --> 00:45:44,147
lf your dying is a must for building
a hotel, l'll make the arrangement.

407
00:45:44,147 --> 00:45:47,116
Before making arrangements
for other people's bier...

408
00:45:47,217 --> 00:45:48,775
... make arrangements
for your bier, oldie!

409
00:45:49,152 --> 00:45:54,824
No son-of-gun has the guts
to harm those living here!

410
00:45:54,824 --> 00:45:57,292
- Who are you?
- l have many names.

411
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:01,929
Poor parents call me their son
and helpless sisters, their brother.

412
00:46:02,165 --> 00:46:05,464
A friend, of those orphan and
homeless and foe of the tryannt!

413
00:46:05,568 --> 00:46:08,128
Whom do you want to meet?

414
00:46:08,571 --> 00:46:10,129
You talk a lot.

415
00:46:21,184 --> 00:46:23,152
Uncle and aunty come in.

416
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:41,900
Rascals! Had l got
you here to get beaten?

417
00:46:53,216 --> 00:46:55,844
Bijli, get water.

418
00:46:56,219 --> 00:46:58,187
- Tell your dogs to stay put.
- Dogs...

419
00:46:58,521 --> 00:47:00,853
-... stay put!
- Bravo.

420
00:47:01,291 --> 00:47:03,191
- Give it to him.
- Hold it.

421
00:47:06,229 --> 00:47:08,993
Now stuff the paper in his mouth.

422
00:47:13,236 --> 00:47:16,205
- Open your mouth.
- No. - Open!

423
00:47:18,641 --> 00:47:20,199
Drink!

424
00:47:30,253 --> 00:47:32,721
lf you find this
paper anywhere...

425
00:47:32,922 --> 00:47:35,720
... don't get it here or
l'll stuff it again in your mouth.

426
00:47:36,259 --> 00:47:38,227
l'll get even with you.

427
00:47:40,663 --> 00:47:45,032
He must have been our son in
our previous birth.

428
00:47:45,268 --> 00:47:47,736
He doesn't know who l am,
that chit of a boy!

429
00:47:48,271 --> 00:47:50,239
Enough, landlord.

430
00:47:51,341 --> 00:47:54,742
You've come to respectable people's
house, hence l'm letting you go.

431
00:47:55,011 --> 00:47:57,241
- Otherwise...
- You talk a lot.

432
00:47:57,347 --> 00:48:00,283
Don't you wish to see
the sunrise tomorrow?

433
00:48:00,283 --> 00:48:04,242
l accept everyday
as a challenge!

434
00:48:04,354 --> 00:48:07,585
Besides, tomorrow is not Tuesday.

435
00:48:08,358 --> 00:48:11,759
But it is Sunday
l'll have your bags packed.

436
00:48:12,028 --> 00:48:15,759
- This is the last warning. Get
lost you rascal. - Shut up!

437
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:21,259
Don't you dare step into
this house again.

438
00:48:21,704 --> 00:48:24,264
Son, l'll definitely step in...

439
00:48:24,707 --> 00:48:26,436
... but some other time.
Come on.

440
00:48:26,709 --> 00:48:29,439
He made me chew paper,
l'll make him chew grass.

441
00:48:30,313 --> 00:48:33,316
Oh my hot chilly!

442
00:48:33,316 --> 00:48:37,082
l feel like garnishing my
beans curry with you!

443
00:48:37,387 --> 00:48:39,480
You spoke like a real man.

444
00:48:39,722 --> 00:48:41,690
But hope you don't run away
when time comes?

445
00:48:43,326 --> 00:48:45,794
lt is written in my destiny to run.

446
00:48:46,329 --> 00:48:49,298
But friend, when l stop...

447
00:48:50,333 --> 00:48:53,962
- ... such rascals stop breathing.
- That's more like it.

448
00:48:54,337 --> 00:48:57,306
Here, have a smoke.

449
00:48:58,341 --> 00:48:59,706
Here.

450
00:49:00,343 --> 00:49:02,641
Aren't you ashamed of
smoking being a woman?

451
00:49:03,346 --> 00:49:05,974
And aren't you ashamed of
not smoking, being a man?

452
00:49:07,350 --> 00:49:10,114
l do, but for a second.

453
00:49:12,355 --> 00:49:13,720
Fool.

454
00:49:14,357 --> 00:49:17,724
This is your daughter who had
got lost in a fair, years ago.

455
00:49:20,763 --> 00:49:23,129
Look at this mark.

456
00:49:23,366 --> 00:49:25,732
Yes.

457
00:49:27,370 --> 00:49:28,837
- Dear!
- Mother! - My dear.

458
00:49:29,105 --> 00:49:32,836
- Where had you left me?
- Move! Move.

459
00:49:41,384 --> 00:49:43,750
You cheat!

460
00:49:44,387 --> 00:49:46,753
Take them both and push them out!

461
00:49:49,792 --> 00:49:52,352
Wonder how long will
these thugs...

462
00:49:52,795 --> 00:49:55,355
... keep fooling me?

463
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:01,404
Till you continue
inflicting atrocities on the poor.

464
00:50:01,404 --> 00:50:05,704
And till l don't find my lost
daughter, l'll continue doing it.

465
00:50:05,808 --> 00:50:09,039
When l am not at peace,
l won't let anyone live in peace.

466
00:50:10,413 --> 00:50:14,179
Listen, how are we going
to remain alive?

467
00:50:14,417 --> 00:50:18,376
Let us abandon everything
and take god's refuge.

468
00:50:18,921 --> 00:50:21,591
Someday He will pity us.

469
00:50:21,591 --> 00:50:26,051
God's refuge!
We have tried doing that.

470
00:50:26,429 --> 00:50:30,058
For months together we
visited several temples.

471
00:50:30,166 --> 00:50:33,897
Made promises,
and announced huge rewards.

472
00:50:34,737 --> 00:50:39,037
We had taken our daughter
to lord Kumbh's fair for blessings.

473
00:50:39,108 --> 00:50:41,576
This is the blessing he gave us?

474
00:50:42,445 --> 00:50:45,414
Wonder how and where
will my daughter be?

475
00:50:54,457 --> 00:50:57,085
Who, Mr.Suraj?
Yes, partner.

476
00:50:57,460 --> 00:50:59,862
l'll become your partner
the day you...

477
00:50:59,862 --> 00:51:02,160
... get the papers signed and
get the hotel work started.

478
00:51:03,466 --> 00:51:09,098
Look, don't worry; very soon
l'll give you a good news.

479
00:51:09,272 --> 00:51:11,274
And if you don't,
then mind you...

480
00:51:11,274 --> 00:51:14,143
... l'll break your house
and build a hotel.

481
00:51:14,143 --> 00:51:16,441
And make you perform
the first caberat.

482
00:51:19,482 --> 00:51:22,042
Rascals! What are watching?

483
00:51:22,151 --> 00:51:24,987
Go and bash that Shravan's
friend in such a way...

484
00:51:24,987 --> 00:51:27,182
... that he shouldn't even dream
of coming to Pahalgaon.

485
00:51:49,512 --> 00:51:52,481
- Greetings, sir.
- Greetings. - ls this Shravan's house?

486
00:51:52,582 --> 00:51:54,140
- Yes.
- Ah! Ah!

487
00:51:55,518 --> 00:52:00,022
- Who are you?
- l'm Shravan's best friend.

488
00:52:00,022 --> 00:52:01,524
- Professor Ramu.
- Ramu!

489
00:52:01,524 --> 00:52:02,889
Where is he?

490
00:52:03,192 --> 00:52:06,161
He...He has gone to city.

491
00:52:06,529 --> 00:52:10,032
He didn't reach here as well?
Strange man.

492
00:52:10,032 --> 00:52:12,830
He said he'd pick me
up from Jalandhar.

493
00:52:12,935 --> 00:52:15,495
Neither did he come
here nor there.

494
00:52:15,605 --> 00:52:17,505
l had to come alone from Jalandhar
Where is he?

495
00:52:18,541 --> 00:52:21,009
Where are his parents?

496
00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:24,509
- They have gone to the temple.
- Good! Very good.

497
00:52:24,614 --> 00:52:28,573
Look mister, l've come to
Kashmir to improve my health.

498
00:52:28,951 --> 00:52:31,554
- Where is my room?
- Feel at home.

499
00:52:31,554 --> 00:52:32,919
Thank you.

500
00:52:33,055 --> 00:52:37,014
Oh God, what an
absent minded professor l am.

501
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:39,319
l forgot to ask your name.
Who are you?

502
00:52:39,629 --> 00:52:41,897
l... l am also Shravan's friend.

503
00:52:41,897 --> 00:52:44,567
But l know all of his friends.

504
00:52:44,567 --> 00:52:46,569
l never heard about you.

505
00:52:46,569 --> 00:52:49,739
l am not so famous that
you'll hear about me.

506
00:52:49,739 --> 00:52:52,537
- Even Shravan doesn't know me.
- Pardon?!

507
00:52:52,642 --> 00:52:55,543
l mean we got separated in
childhood, and still haven't met.

508
00:52:55,645 --> 00:52:57,203
Oh, l see!

509
00:52:57,313 --> 00:53:00,043
This appears to be like the
film 'Ram Aur Shyam'.

510
00:53:00,583 --> 00:53:04,041
Yes sir.
Think that way.

511
00:53:04,253 --> 00:53:07,089
Now you are here.
l'll go.

512
00:53:07,089 --> 00:53:08,886
Won't you meet Shravan?

513
00:53:09,659 --> 00:53:13,891
When Ram is here,
what will Shyam do?

514
00:53:16,599 --> 00:53:18,066
Strange friend.

515
00:53:19,602 --> 00:53:20,967
Father!

516
00:53:22,605 --> 00:53:25,233
Greetings!
Who are you?

517
00:53:25,608 --> 00:53:29,374
- Are you Shravan's friend?
- Best friend! What is your problem?

518
00:53:29,612 --> 00:53:30,909
You'll be in problem now.

519
00:53:36,619 --> 00:53:38,587
What is this?
What is the matter?

520
00:53:39,622 --> 00:53:43,080
Which school are you from?

521
00:53:52,635 --> 00:53:56,093
Listen to me.
l'll get angry.

522
00:54:01,644 --> 00:54:05,102
l don't understand
what my fault is.

523
00:54:05,715 --> 00:54:09,276
Eat this.
Don't beat.

524
00:54:26,669 --> 00:54:29,433
Now l'm getting angry.
l'll kill everyone.

525
00:54:34,677 --> 00:54:37,043
l didn't do anything, mister.

526
00:54:37,179 --> 00:54:39,147
He deserved it.
l didn't do anything.

527
00:54:39,682 --> 00:54:41,149
Why this rolling-pin?

528
00:54:41,684 --> 00:54:43,652
No!

529
00:54:47,723 --> 00:54:51,318
lf you find this rolling-pin,
don't get it back.

530
00:54:51,494 --> 00:54:53,462
Or l'll shove it again in
your mouth. Understood!

531
00:54:57,700 --> 00:54:59,668
Thank you.

532
00:55:00,703 --> 00:55:03,672
- Which school are you from?
- Shut up!

533
00:55:06,709 --> 00:55:09,177
You will never pass.

534
00:55:11,714 --> 00:55:14,683
- You beat me?
- Yes. What will you do?

535
00:55:24,727 --> 00:55:26,695
Stop! Stop!

536
00:55:29,732 --> 00:55:32,200
Some goons are after me,
drive fast.

537
00:55:32,735 --> 00:55:36,694
Driver, drive fast.

538
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:38,707
You!

539
00:55:39,141 --> 00:55:42,372
You! After you left
some goons came.

540
00:55:42,545 --> 00:55:45,378
They asked me whether
l was Shravan's friend, Ramu.

541
00:55:45,548 --> 00:55:47,709
l said yes and they
pounced on me.

542
00:55:47,817 --> 00:55:52,755
They beat me like a washerman
beats his clothes on the stone.

543
00:55:52,755 --> 00:55:56,122
l thought l'd eat apples in Kashmir,
they fed me a rolling-pin.

544
00:55:56,258 --> 00:55:59,386
- His parents?
- They didn't meet me.

545
00:55:59,495 --> 00:56:02,055
- Won't you go back?
- Back?

546
00:56:02,164 --> 00:56:03,722
Have l gone crazy?

547
00:56:04,166 --> 00:56:08,068
lf ever l come across the
name of this town in any book...

548
00:56:08,170 --> 00:56:10,195
... l'll tear that page.
Hurry up, driver.

549
00:56:10,272 --> 00:56:14,732
- Where are you going?
- Back, l forgot something. - What?

550
00:56:16,178 --> 00:56:18,738
- Duty.
- Oh! - See you soon.

551
00:56:18,848 --> 00:56:21,749
- l won't see you. Drive fast.
- Stop the bus.

552
00:56:34,797 --> 00:56:38,927
Rice bags here and
wheat here, good keep it.

553
00:56:39,134 --> 00:56:41,804
Arrange them, you too.

554
00:56:41,804 --> 00:56:45,433
Arrange them peacefully
my brave boys.

555
00:56:52,214 --> 00:56:55,775
Get the last one too.

556
00:56:57,219 --> 00:57:01,280
Keep it here, my brother.
Grass.

557
00:57:02,224 --> 00:57:03,782
Grains are gold, my friend.

558
00:57:03,893 --> 00:57:05,793
Bravo! Bravo!
Our work is done.

559
00:57:07,229 --> 00:57:11,290
The police won't even know there
are grains beneath the grass.

560
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:22,344
How do l explain to you
that the grains are out of stock.

561
00:57:22,344 --> 00:57:25,802
Look, there was no rainfall last
year hence no harvest.

562
00:57:25,915 --> 00:57:29,852
This year there was such a heavy
rainfall that the crops got destroyed.

563
00:57:29,852 --> 00:57:32,354
Just think, when there has been
no harvest from the past two years...

564
00:57:32,354 --> 00:57:33,616
-... where do l get it from?
- Hey you...

565
00:57:33,856 --> 00:57:36,859
When you knew there has been
no harvest from 2 years...

566
00:57:36,859 --> 00:57:38,827
... then why did you
take the advance?

567
00:57:39,862 --> 00:57:41,830
Answer us?

568
00:57:41,897 --> 00:57:44,991
l thought this year America
would supply us with some.

569
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:47,870
lf not the Americans then there
are our Russian brothers.

570
00:57:47,870 --> 00:57:50,839
None of them
sent it, what do l do?

571
00:57:50,906 --> 00:57:53,170
Take back your advance.

572
00:57:53,275 --> 00:57:55,210
Beware! Don't listen to him.

573
00:57:55,210 --> 00:57:59,306
lf the grains come in a day or two,
he'll sell it to us double the price.

574
00:57:59,882 --> 00:58:03,340
Only if l get will l sell it
to you. Now get going!

575
00:58:03,886 --> 00:58:05,911
My friend!

576
00:58:07,890 --> 00:58:10,859
Dogs! How did he get here?

577
00:58:11,293 --> 00:58:13,591
When one is hungry...

578
00:58:13,896 --> 00:58:16,660
... one is even ready to eat grass.

579
00:58:16,899 --> 00:58:19,868
Then feed them grass
and spare me.

580
00:58:19,969 --> 00:58:22,028
l won't spare you, landlord!

581
00:58:22,304 --> 00:58:25,407
Friends, listen to me and
take back your advance.

582
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:27,671
Grass contains lots of vitamins.

583
00:58:27,977 --> 00:58:31,080
Talk sense. Are we animals
to eat grass?

584
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:35,881
Listen to me, today l'll
feed you a special kind of grass.

585
00:59:03,879 --> 00:59:06,848
''This is the public''

586
00:59:07,049 --> 00:59:09,847
''This is the public,
it knows everything''

587
00:59:17,893 --> 00:59:19,861
''What is there inside''

588
00:59:20,896 --> 00:59:22,864
''What is there outside''

589
00:59:23,899 --> 00:59:29,860
''lnside, outside,
it recognises everything''

590
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:27,963
''When it wants, it can adore you''

591
01:00:27,963 --> 01:00:30,727
''Or it can also throw you down''

592
01:00:35,971 --> 01:00:38,974
''First they run behind you...''

593
01:00:38,974 --> 01:00:41,977
''... then you have to
run behind them''

594
01:00:41,977 --> 01:00:46,744
''lf thier heart breaks or
they get angry...''

595
01:00:49,985 --> 01:00:53,284
''... then they never reconcile''

596
01:01:30,025 --> 01:01:35,486
''lf an actor or a politician
try to decieve the public''

597
01:01:41,036 --> 01:01:46,338
''All his fame flies off
like a gust of wind''

598
01:01:47,042 --> 01:01:49,545
''Don't use force''

599
01:01:49,545 --> 01:01:51,513
''Don't make noises''

600
01:01:55,050 --> 01:01:58,019
''Ours is a peaceful city''

601
01:02:35,090 --> 01:02:40,551
''You hid jewels but we did
not say anything''

602
01:02:46,101 --> 01:02:51,403
'' But when you hid food grains,
the hungry mouths are speaking''

603
01:02:52,107 --> 01:02:56,567
''We are not begging or
asking for loans''

604
01:03:00,115 --> 01:03:03,573
''They are just asking
for thier rights''

605
01:03:37,152 --> 01:03:39,620
''Mister, this is
the public, Mister''

606
01:04:15,190 --> 01:04:18,193
Aunty, today l have cooked
such a scrumptious food...

607
01:04:18,193 --> 01:04:20,696
... that along with it you'll
start chewing your fingers too.

608
01:04:20,696 --> 01:04:24,154
This contains roti, potatoes,
cauliflower, sweet dish.

609
01:04:27,202 --> 01:04:27,964
Hey, what is wrong with you?

610
01:04:32,207 --> 01:04:34,835
The school's head master
has sent a message...

611
01:04:35,210 --> 01:04:37,678
... that they can't
wait for Shravan any longer.

612
01:04:39,214 --> 01:04:42,217
lf he doesn't come soon,
they will appoint someone else.

613
01:04:42,217 --> 01:04:45,516
Oh God!
That is too bad.

614
01:04:50,225 --> 01:04:53,729
Don't you worry, aunty.
Till Shravan doesn't come...

615
01:04:53,729 --> 01:04:56,357
... our Ramu will teach them.

616
01:04:57,232 --> 01:04:59,234
Me!

617
01:04:59,234 --> 01:05:02,237
Have you gone mad?
How will l teach them?

618
01:05:02,237 --> 01:05:05,536
Why? Even you are a teacher,
what's the harm in teaching?

619
01:05:05,741 --> 01:05:09,541
lnstead of lazing around,
if you work what is the harm?

620
01:05:09,745 --> 01:05:11,872
- Bijli, l can't teach children.
- And why?

621
01:05:12,047 --> 01:05:15,016
l'm a very learned man, l can teach
elders but not younger ones.

622
01:05:15,250 --> 01:05:17,878
Then teach them what you
know. lt's only a matter of 2 days.

623
01:05:18,253 --> 01:05:20,881
She is right, son.

624
01:05:22,257 --> 01:05:23,884
Your time will pass.

625
01:05:24,259 --> 01:05:26,261
And Shravan's job
will be secured.

626
01:05:26,261 --> 01:05:30,766
Son, if he loses this job
we will be in a fix.

627
01:05:30,766 --> 01:05:32,934
- Say yes, son.
- l...

628
01:05:32,934 --> 01:05:36,271
- Should l butter you?
- You don't seem to understand!

629
01:05:36,271 --> 01:05:39,240
- No buts, get going.
- Don't push.

630
01:06:04,299 --> 01:06:08,258
l didn't go to school in childhood,
hence l'm getting scared.

631
01:06:09,304 --> 01:06:10,305
What?

632
01:06:10,305 --> 01:06:12,808
l mean, no one took me to school
like this in childhood.

633
01:06:12,808 --> 01:06:14,935
Hence l'm getting scared.

634
01:06:15,310 --> 01:06:18,768
ls this a prison,
that you are getting scared?

635
01:06:20,315 --> 01:06:22,317
l can escape from a prison,
but how do l escape from here?

636
01:06:22,317 --> 01:06:23,614
Who will catch you here?

637
01:06:23,819 --> 01:06:26,287
No one, but l'll get caught.

638
01:06:27,322 --> 01:06:29,950
l mean, l'll get to
learn something.

639
01:06:30,325 --> 01:06:32,953
You have come to teach
and not to learn.

640
01:06:33,328 --> 01:06:34,955
Your talks are beyond me.

641
01:06:36,331 --> 01:06:38,299
Go.

642
01:06:39,334 --> 01:06:41,461
- Okay.
- Get going.

643
01:06:44,339 --> 01:06:45,806
Hey!

644
01:06:47,342 --> 01:06:50,311
After school, meet me
under that tree.

645
01:06:58,353 --> 01:07:00,355
l've come.

646
01:07:00,355 --> 01:07:02,323
Are you the head master?

647
01:07:03,358 --> 01:07:05,826
Do l look like a peon to you?

648
01:07:06,361 --> 01:07:08,329
l've come in place of Shravan.

649
01:07:10,365 --> 01:07:12,701
Hurry up, the new teacher
is coming.

650
01:07:12,701 --> 01:07:15,670
- The bell is about to ring.
- l've finished.

651
01:07:18,373 --> 01:07:23,378
l've straightened all
the devils in my class.

652
01:07:23,378 --> 01:07:25,881
- Here.
- Keep it with you.

653
01:07:25,881 --> 01:07:27,849
l'll send for it if need be.

654
01:07:28,049 --> 01:07:32,721
That's fine. Do you know what
your subject is? History.

655
01:07:32,721 --> 01:07:35,557
Principal, l'll teach them
history in such a way...

656
01:07:35,557 --> 01:07:37,354
... that the history
of this school will change.

657
01:07:43,398 --> 01:07:45,866
What are you doing?

658
01:07:47,402 --> 01:07:48,904
Listen!

659
01:07:48,904 --> 01:07:51,031
That is the way we
greet our elders.

660
01:07:51,406 --> 01:07:55,911
When a new teacher comes
we welcome him by bursting these.

661
01:07:55,911 --> 01:07:57,879
- Right!
- Yes!

662
01:07:58,413 --> 01:08:00,881
Are you through?
Now to your seats.

663
01:08:11,426 --> 01:08:15,192
Sir, till you don't sit,
how can we?

664
01:08:21,436 --> 01:08:24,405
The carpenters here are bad, sir.
They use spit instead of glue.

665
01:08:24,606 --> 01:08:27,074
- Should l get another chair?
- No.

666
01:08:33,448 --> 01:08:37,908
Look children, my
style of teaching is different.

667
01:08:38,119 --> 01:08:41,088
So is our style
of learning, sir!

668
01:08:41,456 --> 01:08:43,458
Before starting the lesson...

669
01:08:43,458 --> 01:08:46,127
... l would like to you
to introduce yourselves to me.

670
01:08:46,127 --> 01:08:49,464
Hence, first tell me your names.

671
01:08:49,464 --> 01:08:52,433
Sir, tell us your name first.

672
01:08:53,468 --> 01:08:55,936
My name ... is Ramkumar.

673
01:08:56,137 --> 01:08:59,106
- Mine is Monday.
- Mine is Tuesday.

674
01:08:59,274 --> 01:09:02,477
- Mine is Wednesday.
- Mine is Sunday.

675
01:09:02,477 --> 01:09:04,145
Shut up!

676
01:09:04,145 --> 01:09:06,982
l want to know your real names.

677
01:09:06,982 --> 01:09:09,109
Nowadays nothing is real, sir!

678
01:09:09,284 --> 01:09:13,243
Milk, ghee, oil, curd
everything is fake.

679
01:09:13,488 --> 01:09:16,116
Are you also fake, sir?

680
01:09:17,492 --> 01:09:18,959
No!

681
01:09:19,494 --> 01:09:23,453
- This won't do! Tell me do you
want to study or no? - No!

682
01:09:24,499 --> 01:09:27,957
That's more like it. l don't want
to teach either, sit and relax.

683
01:09:31,506 --> 01:09:33,474
Present, sir!

684
01:09:35,510 --> 01:09:38,968
l just got a message that
Mangal is hiding in this area.

685
01:09:39,514 --> 01:09:42,017
Hence keep a strict vigil
on every new comer.

686
01:09:42,017 --> 01:09:45,520
Sir, if you order, l'll
put every new comer in the lock up.

687
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:50,480
No, tonight Mangal's
posters will be coming.

688
01:09:51,026 --> 01:09:52,527
Hmm... posters!

689
01:09:52,527 --> 01:09:56,657
When an ants death is
near, his posters get printed.

690
01:09:56,865 --> 01:09:58,298
Fate!

691
01:09:58,533 --> 01:10:02,492
You saved me from the gallows and
trapped me here as a teacher!

692
01:10:10,545 --> 01:10:12,012
Hey!

693
01:10:12,547 --> 01:10:15,175
Look, how l have bedecked.

694
01:10:17,552 --> 01:10:20,180
Hey!
No reply?

695
01:10:21,556 --> 01:10:24,059
What happened?
Got angry?

696
01:10:24,059 --> 01:10:28,189
l got delayed
hence you got angry?

697
01:10:31,566 --> 01:10:33,234
Look, l got my name engraved.

698
01:10:33,234 --> 01:10:35,702
l was going to
your name engraved too.

699
01:10:36,237 --> 01:10:40,575
Then l thought if you write
it on your own it'll be fun!

700
01:10:40,575 --> 01:10:42,543
Here, l've got the fountain pen.

701
01:10:43,078 --> 01:10:44,545
Here, write it.

702
01:10:48,583 --> 01:10:49,550
Write!

703
01:10:51,586 --> 01:10:55,215
Aren't you ashamed of
making love talks to me?

704
01:10:55,590 --> 01:10:57,558
Lo!

705
01:10:58,593 --> 01:11:02,051
Aren't you ashamed that being
a woman l'm telling you all this?

706
01:11:03,598 --> 01:11:05,225
Bijli, l'm a fire.

707
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:07,898
Don't play with me or
you'll get burnt.

708
01:11:08,603 --> 01:11:11,367
lf you are fire,
then l'm lightning.

709
01:11:11,606 --> 01:11:14,575
What a lovely duo we will make!

710
01:11:16,611 --> 01:11:21,378
Don't talk nonsense with me.
l'm very angry today.

711
01:11:33,628 --> 01:11:35,255
Hey! What impudence is this?

712
01:11:35,630 --> 01:11:39,088
Hey girl, you shut up!
l'm a stiff man.

713
01:11:39,634 --> 01:11:42,102
Hey you coward!
Come out!

714
01:11:42,637 --> 01:11:44,104
Come out!

715
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:49,098
Look, don't act smart.
Raise your hands!!

716
01:11:49,644 --> 01:11:51,271
Raise your hands.

717
01:11:52,647 --> 01:11:53,982
Quick.

718
01:11:53,982 --> 01:12:00,114
Come here.
Not there come here!

719
01:12:02,657 --> 01:12:06,661
Mangal Singh,
have you come to fight me?

720
01:12:06,661 --> 01:12:08,629
l'll bash you!

721
01:12:12,667 --> 01:12:16,626
l scared the daylights out of you!

722
01:12:16,838 --> 01:12:20,675
The day l catch Mangal, he'll
get scared exactly the same way.

723
01:12:20,675 --> 01:12:25,305
- l'll give him a run for his life.
- Run for his life! My foot!

724
01:12:26,681 --> 01:12:29,445
Constable, Mangal is a
very clever man.

725
01:12:29,684 --> 01:12:32,687
Possibly he must have come before
you and escaped stealthily?

726
01:12:32,687 --> 01:12:35,315
That's impossible!

727
01:12:35,690 --> 01:12:38,158
l'm a very stiff man!

728
01:12:38,693 --> 01:12:41,161
- Shut up!
- Constable...

729
01:12:41,696 --> 01:12:44,199
... when you don't recognise
Mangal how will you catch him?

730
01:12:44,199 --> 01:12:47,327
By tomorrow every child of
this village will recognise him.

731
01:12:47,502 --> 01:12:50,335
- How come?
- Tonight in the police jeep...

732
01:12:50,505 --> 01:12:54,168
... his posters will be
coming in the village .

733
01:12:54,375 --> 01:12:58,213
l have also given my
picture to the press.

734
01:12:58,213 --> 01:13:00,715
To publish my picture
with that of Mangal's...

735
01:13:00,715 --> 01:13:04,173
... the day l arrest him.

736
01:13:22,737 --> 01:13:26,195
Let us see whose
poster is pasted tomorrow.

737
01:13:27,742 --> 01:13:34,705
- The road is blocked.
- Let us remove it.

738
01:14:29,804 --> 01:14:33,608
''One who arrests Mangal will
be given a reward of Rs. 25000.''

739
01:14:33,608 --> 01:14:35,576
There he is!

740
01:15:27,862 --> 01:15:30,626
- Salutations, constable.
- Same to you.

741
01:15:31,866 --> 01:15:33,868
Why are people running
away on seeing you?

742
01:15:33,868 --> 01:15:37,872
They get scared of me.
They know l'm a strict man!

743
01:15:37,872 --> 01:15:40,875
But till yesterday people didn't
fear you so much?

744
01:15:40,875 --> 01:15:45,835
They will fear me more, the day
l arrest that murderer Mangal.

745
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:48,845
Then they won't even
peep out of their beds.

746
01:15:49,884 --> 01:15:52,887
After that.
l'll get a promotion.

747
01:15:52,887 --> 01:15:55,890
Okay l'll leave, l think
your promotion is near.

748
01:15:55,890 --> 01:15:57,653
That will come!

749
01:15:59,894 --> 01:16:01,896
- Salute me.
- Hands up.

750
01:16:01,896 --> 01:16:04,899
- Whom are you telling?
- You! Arrest Mangal.

751
01:16:04,899 --> 01:16:08,903
Mangal must be in the jungle
l'm constable Kadaksingh.

752
01:16:08,903 --> 01:16:10,905
l'll shoot everyone.

753
01:16:10,905 --> 01:16:12,407
Shut up! You are dacoit Mangal...

754
01:16:12,407 --> 01:16:15,535
...disguised as a police.
You can't cheat us.

755
01:16:15,910 --> 01:16:18,538
- Take him.
- What nonsense!

756
01:16:18,913 --> 01:16:21,882
l'm Kadaksingh.

757
01:16:34,929 --> 01:16:38,933
That stupid teacher
is not going to come today.

758
01:16:38,933 --> 01:16:41,936
How do you know that
he won't come?

759
01:16:41,936 --> 01:16:44,105
Friend, l've not spared anybody.

760
01:16:44,105 --> 01:16:47,942
After what happened yesterday
even his father won't step here.

761
01:16:47,942 --> 01:16:51,946
- ls that so?
- Yes. - Then lay a bet.

762
01:16:51,946 --> 01:16:53,914
Five to one.
Anyone there.

763
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:09,964
Yesterday you gave me
salutation of ten cannons.

764
01:17:09,964 --> 01:17:11,431
lsn't it?

765
01:17:11,966 --> 01:17:16,266
Today it's my turn.
Greetings. Come on.

766
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,969
l returned you what
you gave me yesterday.

767
01:17:50,004 --> 01:17:52,973
Does that settle the score?

768
01:17:54,008 --> 01:17:55,976
Don't look over there!

769
01:17:57,011 --> 01:18:00,970
Hats off to both of us. Neither
did you win, nor did l lose.

770
01:18:06,020 --> 01:18:10,358
- What is it? - Out with
the money! He won't come, eh?

771
01:18:10,358 --> 01:18:13,027
He turned out to be your father.

772
01:18:13,027 --> 01:18:14,790
- Out with it.
- Giving.

773
01:18:15,029 --> 01:18:16,997
This new teacher spoilt my mood.

774
01:18:36,050 --> 01:18:38,052
May l ask why is money
being distributed...

775
01:18:38,052 --> 01:18:39,519
... so mercilessly in this
poor nation? Answer me.

776
01:18:41,055 --> 01:18:43,558
- Yesterday l had laid a bet.
- What bet?

777
01:18:43,558 --> 01:18:47,061
- That... that.
- Answer!

778
01:18:47,061 --> 01:18:48,563
... that you'd run away.

779
01:18:48,563 --> 01:18:50,064
Yes, l did run.

780
01:18:50,064 --> 01:18:53,067
But instead of going
out l came in.

781
01:18:53,067 --> 01:18:56,036
Get sweets from this money and
distribute it in Karan's name.

782
01:18:59,073 --> 01:19:00,540
Okay, teacher!

783
01:19:01,075 --> 01:19:03,839
So children, now we shall
learn history.

784
01:19:04,078 --> 01:19:07,377
Tell me, who was Akbar?

785
01:19:07,582 --> 01:19:10,084
- Shall l say?
- Shall l say!

786
01:19:10,084 --> 01:19:11,551
- Humayun's son.
- Wrong.

787
01:19:12,086 --> 01:19:14,054
- You.
- Barbar's grandson.

788
01:19:14,422 --> 01:19:16,049
Wrong again.

789
01:19:17,091 --> 01:19:19,719
- Akbar was Salim's father.
- Wrong!

790
01:19:21,095 --> 01:19:25,555
- Then who was Akbar?
- Prithviraj Kapoor was Akbar.

791
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:29,558
- History does not say this.
- Forgot Mughal-e-Azam?

792
01:19:34,108 --> 01:19:36,076
Now tell me, who was Salim?

793
01:19:38,112 --> 01:19:40,114
Bravo boys!

794
01:19:40,114 --> 01:19:43,117
How many sons did Akbar have?

795
01:19:43,117 --> 01:19:45,415
One was prince Salim.

796
01:19:46,120 --> 01:19:50,124
- Wrong.
- Sir, Salim was Akbar's son.

797
01:19:50,124 --> 01:19:53,127
- Akbar had three sons.
- Three!

798
01:19:53,127 --> 01:19:55,095

799
01:19:56,130 --> 01:19:57,597
Three.

800
01:20:06,140 --> 01:20:09,598
- Bloody, our kind of teacher.
- Abusing me! You.

801
01:20:10,144 --> 01:20:11,907
Stand here.

802
01:20:12,146 --> 01:20:15,445
Hey teacher! Should l
come in or will you come here?

803
01:20:17,151 --> 01:20:18,152
Yes?

804
01:20:18,152 --> 01:20:23,157
- This rascal is a dog!
- Quiet! This is a school!

805
01:20:23,157 --> 01:20:25,159
Throw the cigarette. What effect
will it have on children?!

806
01:20:25,159 --> 01:20:29,118

They smoke in discreet.

807
01:20:30,164 --> 01:20:32,333
He is my aunt's son.
Teach him.

808
01:20:32,333 --> 01:20:35,169
He is very mischievous.
lf he acts smart while studying...

809
01:20:35,169 --> 01:20:37,933
... give him one bash and
smash him to pulp.

810
01:20:38,172 --> 01:20:40,140
Okay you go.

811
01:20:40,508 --> 01:20:44,137
- What's your name?
- Hey listen!

812
01:20:45,179 --> 01:20:47,807
- Now what?
- What will you eat for dinner!

813
01:20:47,982 --> 01:20:49,517
- Turkey.
- Shut up!

814
01:20:49,517 --> 01:20:53,187
l'll eat what you cook.
Now don't eat my brains.

815
01:20:53,187 --> 01:20:54,689
Let me teach the
children, get lost!

816
01:20:54,689 --> 01:20:57,525
Now that he has become a
teacher, he is acting smart.

817
01:20:57,525 --> 01:21:00,153
Okay children remove
your history book.

818
01:21:01,195 --> 01:21:03,663
You read the lesson.

819
01:21:49,276 --> 01:21:50,778
My friend.

820
01:21:50,778 --> 01:21:54,782
- Where did you find this bangle?
- This is not a bangle...

821
01:21:54,782 --> 01:21:56,750
... but a handcuff.

822
01:21:57,284 --> 01:21:58,911
Where did you find it?

823
01:21:59,286 --> 01:22:03,290
Teacher, looks like you've
forgotten me, but l haven't.

824
01:22:03,290 --> 01:22:04,917

825
01:22:07,294 --> 01:22:09,421
- You didn't tell anybody,
did you? - Not yet.

826
01:22:11,298 --> 01:22:14,062
You are a very nice boy.
Don't ever tell anyone, okay!

827
01:22:14,301 --> 01:22:16,064
There is no guarantee of that.

828
01:22:17,304 --> 01:22:20,474
Give me my cuff.

829
01:22:20,474 --> 01:22:22,442
Not cuff but handcuffs.

830
01:22:22,643 --> 01:22:25,312
- But not like this.
- Then how will you give it?

831

- You won't beat me.
- l won't. - You'll pass me.

836
01:22:39,660 --> 01:22:41,787
- Yes.
- You won't tell my aunt? - No.

837
01:22:42,329 --> 01:22:44,331
Hey, even you shouldn't
tell anybody.

838
01:22:44,331 --> 01:22:47,334
- lf l wanted to, l would've
said long back. - Smart boy.

839
01:22:47,334 --> 01:22:48,801
Give me the other one.

- You are a big scoundrel.
- Yes, but not as big as you.

843
01:23:01,348 --> 01:23:05,808
No doubt.But you turned
out to be my father.

844
01:23:11,358 --> 01:23:12,985
Hey wait.

845
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:15,362

Hey sage!

852
01:23:33,881 --> 01:23:36,349
l've also played this drama.

853
01:23:36,550 --> 01:23:40,145
l'm well-versed in all this.
Don't act smart.

854
01:23:40,387 --> 01:23:44,391
Cruel fellow. Your heart is not
as beautiful as your face.

855
01:23:44,391 --> 01:23:47,360
- Sit.
- Okay! Okay! Don't shout.

856
01:23:48,395 --> 01:23:50,363
- Stretch your hand.
- Eh?

857
01:23:55,402 --> 01:23:58,860
Read my leg too if you wish,
but you won't get anything.

858
01:23:59,406 --> 01:24:04,366
Parents gave birth to
me but forgot to write my fate.

859
01:24:05,412 --> 01:24:08,415
- Excellent!
- Don't bluff! - Really.

860
01:24:08,415 --> 01:24:11,418
Pluto is going towards Uranus.

861
01:24:11,418 --> 01:24:16,549
You will become rich now,
very soon you'll go up!

862
01:24:17,424 --> 01:24:19,892
The authorities are
trying to send me up...

863
01:24:20,094 --> 01:24:23,430
... but l think
l still have time.

864
01:24:23,430 --> 01:24:25,432
But there is absolute
darkness in one house.

865
01:24:25,432 --> 01:24:27,434
lt can be evaded.

866
01:24:27,434 --> 01:24:32,064
When lightning strikes, your
life will get illuminated.

867
01:24:34,441 --> 01:24:37,410
lt already has!

868
01:24:37,611 --> 01:24:40,580
l've begun to see everything.

869
01:24:41,448 --> 01:24:43,450
- Listen.
- There is a girl. - ls it.

870
01:24:43,450 --> 01:24:46,453
Very beautiful.
Very talkative but naive at heart.

871
01:24:46,453 --> 01:24:50,412
She doesn't love you. But woo her
and fortune will favour you.

872
01:24:51,458 --> 01:24:52,960
Her name?

873
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:55,462
Riding on the chariot of clouds
she thundered in the sky...

874
01:24:55,462 --> 01:24:57,965
... and struck on earth,
her name is Bijli.

875
01:24:57,965 --> 01:24:59,967
Bijli? Disgusting!
Who will marry her?

876
01:24:59,967 --> 01:25:02,469
Black as charcoal with long
teeth what will l do with her?

877
01:25:02,469 --> 01:25:04,471
- What?
- Yes sage.

878
01:25:04,471 --> 01:25:07,474
Short, dark, snubbed nose
small eyes, dwarf.

879
01:25:07,474 --> 01:25:11,478
- Do l want to die marrying her?
- Am l dark, do l have long teeth?

880
01:25:11,478 --> 01:25:13,480
What else?

881
01:25:13,480 --> 01:25:15,482
What do l lack, tell me?

882
01:25:15,482 --> 01:25:18,246
Thank your stars
that l selected you.

883
01:25:18,485 --> 01:25:21,488
lf you find anyone like me
in the neighbouring villages...

884
01:25:21,488 --> 01:25:24,252
... then l'll be enslaved to you.

885
01:25:24,491 --> 01:25:27,255
- Get lost.
- Did you see this fair skin?

886
01:25:27,494 --> 01:25:29,496
Even if you scrub yourself
for ten years day and night...

887
01:25:29,496 --> 01:25:31,794
... yet you won't get
this colour, understood?

888
01:25:37,504 --> 01:25:41,463
''Don't have pride on
your fair complexion''

889
01:25:43,510 --> 01:25:47,469
''lt will fade off in two days''

890
01:25:59,526 --> 01:26:03,485
''l am the flame and
you are the moth''

891
01:26:09,536 --> 01:26:12,505
''You will burn before me''

892
01:26:37,564 --> 01:26:40,567
'' Beauty fades away...

893
01:26:40,567 --> 01:26:45,027
''... but this love does
not fade my dear''

894
01:26:45,572 --> 01:26:48,575
''Just by one flower fading...''

895
01:26:48,575 --> 01:26:52,875
''... the garden does not end''

896
01:26:59,586 --> 01:27:04,546
''You have said a
very great thing''

897
01:27:10,597 --> 01:27:14,556
''lt will create excitement
in this unfaithful heart''

898
01:27:51,638 --> 01:27:58,601
''lf you don't want it,
than leave this love right now''

899
01:27:59,646 --> 01:28:05,607
''This is the weather of love,
leave all the fights aside''

900
01:28:13,660 --> 01:28:18,620
''Give your hand in mine''

901
01:28:24,671 --> 01:28:28,630
''All the time will pass in talks''

902
01:29:02,709 --> 01:29:09,672
''Will you agree if l
intoxicate you in my love''

903
01:29:10,717 --> 01:29:17,179
''Proud lady, will you agree
if l go away from you''

904
01:29:25,732 --> 01:29:29,190
''No matter how hard you try
to go away from me''

905
01:29:35,742 --> 01:29:40,202
''The magic of this beauty
will affect you''

906
01:30:00,767 --> 01:30:02,769
Have you seen this man?

907
01:30:02,769 --> 01:30:06,940
l think l've seen him, sir
but l don't know where.

908
01:30:06,940 --> 01:30:09,738
Okay, next time you see him
inform at the police station.

909
01:30:14,781 --> 01:30:16,783
lt was here.
Where is it?

910
01:30:16,783 --> 01:30:20,412
- You must've kept it elsewhere
Try to remember. - No,one minute.

911
01:30:21,788 --> 01:30:23,790
Did anyone see you hiding it?

912
01:30:23,790 --> 01:30:26,258
- No, sir.
- Then where is it? - Here!

913
01:30:27,794 --> 01:30:30,422
You are looking for
this, aren't you?

914
01:30:31,798 --> 01:30:34,096
But aunt, where did
you get this from?

915
01:30:34,801 --> 01:30:37,099
lt flew to me. Now get going.

916
01:30:39,806 --> 01:30:41,308
What will you do with this?

917
01:30:41,308 --> 01:30:44,811
What will l do? l thought this
ornament is adorned by thieves...

918
01:30:44,811 --> 01:30:46,779
... it's better if kids
stay away from it.

919
01:30:46,980 --> 01:30:50,575
- Will you wear this ornament?
- Who me?

920
01:30:50,817 --> 01:30:53,786
What nonsense! Do respectable
people wear handcuffs?

921
01:30:55,822 --> 01:30:57,790
Why are you staring at me?

922
01:30:59,826 --> 01:31:01,828
Are you Mangal?

923
01:31:01,828 --> 01:31:04,296
Who Mangal?
l don't know any Mangal!

924
01:31:04,831 --> 01:31:06,628
Tell me the truth or
l'll call the police now.

925
01:31:07,167 --> 01:31:10,337
l'll gather the entire village,
then you won't be able to run.

926
01:31:10,337 --> 01:31:12,339
Aren't you that murderer Mangal...

927
01:31:12,339 --> 01:31:14,637
... after whom the
entire police force is?

928
01:31:25,185 --> 01:31:27,153
Yes, l'm that Mangal.

929
01:31:30,190 --> 01:31:32,658
Today lightning has
struck Bijli (lightning)!

930
01:31:35,195 --> 01:31:37,197
Go away! Get lost.

931
01:31:37,197 --> 01:31:41,201
Don't ever come back
l say, get lost!

932
01:31:41,201 --> 01:31:44,705
- But Bijli.
- Don't take my name!

933
01:31:44,705 --> 01:31:46,172
Don't chide me so much.

934
01:31:47,207 --> 01:31:50,210
No doubt l'm a criminal,
a murderer...

935
01:31:50,210 --> 01:31:52,212
... but l've never hurt you.

936
01:31:52,212 --> 01:31:53,679
That is what you think, Mangal!

937
01:31:54,214 --> 01:31:58,173
A man dies only once
if pierced with a dagger.

938
01:31:59,219 --> 01:32:01,187
But when someone's
heart breaks...

939
01:32:02,222 --> 01:32:05,988
... he dies everyday,
every minute!

940
01:32:06,226 --> 01:32:10,230
When you've committed so
many crimes, commit one more...

941
01:32:10,230 --> 01:32:12,198
Pierce a dagger in my heart.

942
01:32:13,233 --> 01:32:15,235
Remember l had told you...

943
01:32:15,235 --> 01:32:21,196
... l'm fire don't play with
me or you'll get burnt.

944
01:32:21,575 --> 01:32:26,246
How many times l wanted
to tell you about myself.

945
01:32:26,246 --> 01:32:29,249
My present and my future...

946
01:32:29,249 --> 01:32:32,548
... wanted to hide
my criminal past.

947
01:32:33,253 --> 01:32:39,214
l know, every new day
brings a message of death for me.

948
01:32:40,260 --> 01:32:41,727
Any moment...

949
01:32:41,928 --> 01:32:46,266
... any moment a bullet
from the rifle...

950
01:32:46,266 --> 01:32:49,770
... will be pumped in my chest...

951
01:32:49,770 --> 01:32:54,400
... and get me rid of this sinful
and disgusting life for good.

952
01:32:56,276 --> 01:33:00,235
Wonder which was that accursed
day when God wrote my fate?

953
01:33:02,282 --> 01:33:05,740
Those who were my own, death
snatched them away from me.

954
01:33:06,286 --> 01:33:11,291
First time l wanted to hold
someones hand and make him mine.

955
01:33:11,291 --> 01:33:13,919
But law had already held him.

956
01:33:15,295 --> 01:33:19,595
Good...
that l learnt it before hand.

957
01:33:21,301 --> 01:33:22,768
Otherwise after marriage...

958
01:33:22,969 --> 01:33:25,267
... instead of embellishing
my brow with vermilion...

959
01:33:25,472 --> 01:33:29,067
... you would've embellished
it with someone's blood.

960
01:33:29,309 --> 01:33:31,937
Man is not a criminal by birth.

961
01:33:32,312 --> 01:33:35,281
Time and circumstances
compel him to become one.

962
01:33:35,482 --> 01:33:38,940
The other day you
called me an angel.

963
01:33:39,319 --> 01:33:43,278
But today time took a turn and l
appear worse than a devil to you.

964
01:33:44,324 --> 01:33:46,326
Man is always the same...

965
01:33:46,326 --> 01:33:48,294
... but time changes
his identity.

966
01:33:49,329 --> 01:33:53,322
You don't appear to be
a murderer in anyway.

967
01:33:53,834 --> 01:33:57,337
- Then you...?
- Had there been no stomach...

968
01:33:57,337 --> 01:34:00,636
... then l would not feel hungry
nor anyone try stealing my food.

969
01:34:05,345 --> 01:34:08,803
This is my story.

970
01:34:09,349 --> 01:34:12,318
lf you wish, then get me arrested.

971
01:34:16,356 --> 01:34:18,324
l'll set you free.

972
01:34:19,359 --> 01:34:22,328
But how can this
blessed heart set you free?

973
01:35:06,406 --> 01:35:08,374
Officer, what is the matter?

974
01:35:08,909 --> 01:35:14,040
l'm sorry to inform you.

975
01:35:14,748 --> 01:35:17,046
Your son Shravan...

976
01:35:17,417 --> 01:35:20,875
-... is no more.
- No!

977
01:35:21,922 --> 01:35:24,424
You are lying!
The landlord has sent you.

978
01:35:24,424 --> 01:35:28,053
So that we vacate this house
out of fear, isn't it?

979
01:35:28,428 --> 01:35:33,388
Brother, let alone this house,
we'll leave this village.

980
01:35:33,767 --> 01:35:36,436
But tell me once
that all this is a lie!

981
01:35:36,436 --> 01:35:39,064
Wish this was a lie, uncle.

982
01:35:39,439 --> 01:35:41,566
But what harm had my
son done to anyone?

983
01:35:42,442 --> 01:35:44,778
- That they killed him.
- Mr. lnspector...

984
01:35:44,778 --> 01:35:46,405
How did this happen?

985
01:35:47,447 --> 01:35:51,076
The compartment your
son was travelling in...

986
01:35:52,452 --> 01:35:55,080
... Mangal the fugitive was also
travelling in the same.

987
01:35:55,455 --> 01:35:58,458
lt appears they had
a tussel on something.

988
01:35:58,458 --> 01:36:03,088
And Mangal threw
him out of the train.

989
01:36:06,466 --> 01:36:07,968
Uncle.

990
01:36:07,968 --> 01:36:10,436
Can you tell me
something about your son?

991
01:36:12,472 --> 01:36:14,440
We can't say anything.

992
01:36:16,476 --> 01:36:19,104
Yes, one of his friend is here.

993
01:36:19,479 --> 01:36:21,447
Perhaps he can say something.

994
01:36:22,482 --> 01:36:23,949
Don't you worry.

995
01:36:25,485 --> 01:36:28,943
Once l get that scoundrel
Mangal in my clutches.

996
01:36:29,489 --> 01:36:32,117
l'll have him sent to
the gallows!

997
01:36:47,507 --> 01:36:50,135
Birbal and Jayraj,
the two of you...

998
01:36:50,310 --> 01:36:53,279
... will get Bhagat Singh,
Sukhdev, Rajguru to the platform.

999
01:36:53,513 --> 01:36:56,971
Salim, you will ask
them their last wish.

1000
01:36:57,183 --> 01:36:59,651
Sir, if they don't wish
to be hanged?

1001
01:36:59,853 --> 01:37:02,822
Hey boy... Bhagat is not
a thief like me...

1002
01:37:03,523 --> 01:37:06,981
Bhagat Singh was not a thief that
he would get scared of death.

1003
01:37:07,527 --> 01:37:09,995
Till the last breath he happily
put the noose around him.

1004
01:37:10,196 --> 01:37:12,532
Sir, when Bhagat Singh
was so brave...

1005
01:37:12,532 --> 01:37:14,159
... then why didn't he
escape from the prison?

1006
01:37:14,534 --> 01:37:17,992
Has anyone been able to
escape the gallows till date?

1007
01:37:22,542 --> 01:37:24,510
Some even succeed.

1008
01:37:25,545 --> 01:37:29,504
But for how long
even they don't know.

1009
01:37:30,550 --> 01:37:34,008
Now show me how you will
walk upto to the platform?

1010
01:37:36,556 --> 01:37:38,023
Bad!

1011
01:37:38,224 --> 01:37:41,561
ls this the way freedom fighters
walk upto the platform?

1012
01:37:41,561 --> 01:37:43,529
- Then you show us.
- Okay.

1013
01:37:48,568 --> 01:37:52,572
Teacher, the police is
here to meet you.

1014
01:37:52,572 --> 01:37:55,575
Come on and please show us...

1015
01:37:55,575 --> 01:38:00,035
... how the police hang criminals?

1016
01:38:00,580 --> 01:38:04,584
Our teacher is a simpleton,
he doesn't about all this.

1017
01:38:04,584 --> 01:38:07,553
He'll know only if he
has experienced it.

1018
01:38:14,594 --> 01:38:17,597
Fools, won't you give
up your mischief?

1019
01:38:17,597 --> 01:38:19,599
Did you see how
mischievous they are?

1020
01:38:19,599 --> 01:38:23,103
l say, even teachers must
be given police training.

1021
01:38:23,103 --> 01:38:24,900
So that they can set them right.

1022
01:38:25,105 --> 01:38:29,235
lnspector, the platform is ready
and you are also present here.

1023
01:38:29,409 --> 01:38:31,240
l say hang them!

1024
01:38:31,611 --> 01:38:33,613
Headmaster, children are
bound to play mischief.

1025
01:38:33,613 --> 01:38:35,115
Call the teacher.

1026
01:38:35,115 --> 01:38:39,745
- Will you go from here or the
other way? - The other way.

1027
01:38:48,628 --> 01:38:52,587
Come. Drama's were good
in our times.

1028
01:38:53,633 --> 01:38:56,602
Once a wrestler banged
me on the ground.

1029
01:38:56,803 --> 01:38:59,973
After that no more plays.

1030
01:38:59,973 --> 01:39:01,770
Let us see how our teacher is.

1031
01:39:01,975 --> 01:39:04,944
Teacher, are you okay?

1032
01:39:05,645 --> 01:39:09,604
Come out, the police wants to
talk to you about Shravan Kumar.

1033
01:39:11,651 --> 01:39:14,654
Don't delay, straighten
your back afterwards...

1034
01:39:14,654 --> 01:39:17,623
... or the police will
straighten you.

1035
01:39:20,660 --> 01:39:22,628
Have you locked
the door from outside?

1036
01:39:22,829 --> 01:39:26,287
No. But isn't it
open from inside?

1037
01:39:26,666 --> 01:39:29,635
lt is, just push hard.

1038
01:39:30,670 --> 01:39:33,639
- Why? - This door is
not opening. - Okay.

1039
01:39:41,681 --> 01:39:43,683
What is this?

1040
01:39:43,683 --> 01:39:48,450
l'm the jailor in the play, so l
thought l'd change since l'm down.

1041
01:39:50,690 --> 01:39:52,453
- Are you the teacher?
- Yes.

1042
01:39:52,692 --> 01:39:54,159
l want to ask you about
Shravan Kumar.

1043
01:39:54,694 --> 01:39:58,698
l was about to ask you, where
is he? Why hasn't he come as yet?

1044
01:39:58,698 --> 01:40:01,701
His parents and l are
anxiously waiting for him.

1045
01:40:01,701 --> 01:40:07,003
He was not in the compartment
of the train he was travelling in.

1046
01:40:07,707 --> 01:40:09,470
Blood stains were found
in the compartment.

1047
01:40:09,709 --> 01:40:11,677
And from the finger prints
it is quite obvious...

1048
01:40:12,045 --> 01:40:15,173
...that Shravan Kumar had a
fight with Mangal Singh...

1049
01:40:15,715 --> 01:40:17,683
-... who escaped from
the gallows. - No! No!

1050
01:40:18,051 --> 01:40:20,386
Possibly Shravan Kumar
must have recognised Mangal.

1051
01:40:20,386 --> 01:40:22,479
He must have tried
to catch him...

1052
01:40:22,722 --> 01:40:26,681
... and in the bargain
lost his life.

1053
01:40:27,727 --> 01:40:31,026
After killing him, Mangal
pushed him in the river.

1054
01:40:31,231 --> 01:40:34,200
His body must've been eaten
up by turtles and crabs.

1055
01:40:34,400 --> 01:40:36,368
Because we haven't
found his body as yet.

1056
01:40:37,737 --> 01:40:40,205
Can you tell me something
about Shravan Kumar!

1057
01:40:42,742 --> 01:40:44,209
When did you last meet him?

1058
01:40:44,744 --> 01:40:47,372
For god sake inspector
no more questions.

1059
01:40:47,747 --> 01:40:50,250
Don't you see what's
happened to him...

1060
01:40:50,250 --> 01:40:52,718
... on hearing his
friend's death news?

1061
01:40:53,086 --> 01:40:55,384
Fine.

1062
01:40:55,755 --> 01:40:59,759
But till our investigation is
on, don't leave this village.

1063
01:40:59,759 --> 01:41:02,728
Perhaps l'll need your help.

1064
01:41:03,763 --> 01:41:05,060
Come on.

1065
01:41:23,783 --> 01:41:26,251
l'm responsible for
Shravan's death.

1066
01:41:26,452 --> 01:41:29,421
l'm responsible for his death!

1067
01:41:30,790 --> 01:41:33,759
l... l will have to atone.

1068
01:41:34,794 --> 01:41:36,762
l will have to atone for it.

1069
01:42:27,847 --> 01:42:31,851
l will have to do it.

1070
01:42:31,851 --> 01:42:33,353
- Where are you going?
- To do the work...

1071
01:42:33,353 --> 01:42:36,618
... which l should've done earlier.

1072
01:42:37,857 --> 01:42:39,324
Aunt, what happened?

1073
01:42:39,859 --> 01:42:42,953
Looks like he has
been very badly wounded.

1074
01:42:43,863 --> 01:42:45,831
Definitely the landlords
men must have beaten him.

1075
01:42:46,366 --> 01:42:49,494
Sit here, l'll get turmeric.

1076
01:42:53,873 --> 01:42:58,833
What happened?
How did it happen?

1077
01:43:02,882 --> 01:43:05,350
The venom of sin had
entered in every vein of mine.

1078
01:43:06,886 --> 01:43:10,515
l'm letting it flow out
through this wound.

1079
01:43:11,891 --> 01:43:14,018
l'm that man...

1080
01:43:15,895 --> 01:43:18,864
... who snatched the support
of these blind parents.

1081
01:43:20,900 --> 01:43:23,368
You!

1082
01:43:26,906 --> 01:43:28,874
Yes, Bijli.

1083
01:43:29,242 --> 01:43:31,369
l did.

1084
01:43:35,915 --> 01:43:37,382
Bravo!

1085
01:43:37,917 --> 01:43:41,921
That's more sensible.
Here is Rs. then thousand.

1086
01:43:41,921 --> 01:43:46,381
Had you done this earlier you
wouldn't have to face so much.

1087
01:43:46,926 --> 01:43:49,394
Difficulties have
become our destiny, landlord.

1088
01:43:49,595 --> 01:43:53,224
And our destiny has
been written in tears.

1089
01:43:55,935 --> 01:44:00,895
Pack your bags we'll
leave this house tomorrow itself.

1090
01:44:01,441 --> 01:44:03,568
- Father.
- Hey.

1091
01:44:03,943 --> 01:44:06,571
You came to your senses, son?

1092
01:44:07,947 --> 01:44:10,916
Yes, father.
At the right moment.

1093
01:44:11,284 --> 01:44:13,252
But why...

1094
01:44:14,454 --> 01:44:16,922
... why are you leaving
this house, father?

1095
01:44:17,290 --> 01:44:19,588
Where did you get the
money from?

1096
01:44:19,759 --> 01:44:25,254
- l sold the house to
that landlord. - No!

1097
01:44:25,465 --> 01:44:28,434
No, father. This house
won't be sold at any cost.

1098
01:44:28,968 --> 01:44:30,970
l won't let a hotel come up here.

1099
01:44:30,970 --> 01:44:34,929
Let it be son.
We can't endure our own sorrows.

1100
01:44:35,975 --> 01:44:37,602
How long will we endure
his atrocities?

1101
01:44:38,644 --> 01:44:41,981
Look son, the money that l got...

1102
01:44:41,981 --> 01:44:44,984
... with it, the two of us
will go on a pilgrimage.

1103
01:44:44,984 --> 01:44:46,952
My Shravan always desired...

1104
01:44:47,987 --> 01:44:50,956
... to send us on a pilgrimage.

1105
01:44:51,991 --> 01:44:53,959
But instead of sending us...

1106
01:44:54,327 --> 01:44:57,763
... he himself left us.

1107
01:44:57,997 --> 01:45:00,500
Once that rascal
Mangal comes before...

1108
01:45:00,500 --> 01:45:02,627
l'll these bullets in his chest!

1109
01:45:23,022 --> 01:45:23,989
Father.

1110
01:45:24,190 --> 01:45:31,323
Here is the rifle. Shoot...
your son's murderer is before you.

1111
01:45:33,032 --> 01:45:35,000
Where is he?

1112
01:45:38,037 --> 01:45:40,005
- Before you.
- You?

1113
01:45:43,042 --> 01:45:45,340
Yes, shoot.

1114
01:45:46,379 --> 01:45:48,677
Your heart will be at peace...

1115
01:45:48,848 --> 01:45:51,009
... and this way even l can die.

1116
01:45:54,053 --> 01:45:56,681
l know why you are saying this?

1117
01:45:56,856 --> 01:46:00,348
You can't endure
your friends separation.

1118
01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:02,824
Hence you want to go to him.

1119
01:46:03,062 --> 01:46:05,030
No! No!

1120
01:46:06,065 --> 01:46:09,364
God stole one son
and gave us another.

1121
01:46:09,569 --> 01:46:12,367
He also wants to leave us now.

1122
01:46:20,079 --> 01:46:21,046
Father.

1123
01:46:22,081 --> 01:46:24,549
l'm your son, am l not?

1124
01:46:26,085 --> 01:46:29,384
- You consider me to be
your son, don't you? - Yes.

1125
01:46:29,589 --> 01:46:32,217
Go and return this
money to that landlord!

1126
01:46:32,758 --> 01:46:35,094
This house will not be sold!
l'll send you on a pilgrimage!

1127
01:46:35,094 --> 01:46:37,430
Where will you get
the money from?

1128
01:46:37,430 --> 01:46:40,399
Even if l have to
toil l'll do it.

1129
01:46:42,101 --> 01:46:44,103
l'll do it.

1130
01:46:44,103 --> 01:46:46,401
With my money.

1131
01:46:46,772 --> 01:46:48,740
My money.

1132
01:46:50,109 --> 01:46:53,567
- Will you dance or no?
- No! - No?!

1133
01:46:56,115 --> 01:47:01,075
- You'll have to.
- No!

1134
01:47:01,454 --> 01:47:03,623
l won't! Even if you
take my life!

1135
01:47:03,623 --> 01:47:07,753
Once l've left that dirty
work, l won't do it again.

1136
01:47:08,127 --> 01:47:10,129
Rascal.

1137
01:47:10,129 --> 01:47:13,132
lf she didn't want to do it
you should've got someone else.

1138
01:47:13,132 --> 01:47:17,091
Will your father dance
tonight before Mr. Suraj?

1139
01:47:18,137 --> 01:47:20,139
Go get someone else!

1140
01:47:20,139 --> 01:47:23,643
Boss, we'll have to go
very far. lt'll take 2 days.

1141
01:47:23,643 --> 01:47:26,271
Fool! Couldn't you
think of this before?

1142
01:47:26,479 --> 01:47:29,148
Now you tell me? Get lost!

1143
01:47:29,148 --> 01:47:31,116
l'll set this girl right.

1144
01:47:32,151 --> 01:47:34,153
Look girl, listen to me...

1145
01:47:34,153 --> 01:47:37,782
... we'll make you happy
and pay you double the price.

1146
01:47:40,159 --> 01:47:41,661
Landlord.

1147
01:47:41,661 --> 01:47:44,163
Had your daughter
been in my place...

1148
01:47:44,163 --> 01:47:48,834
... would you compel her to
tread on that dirty path?

1149
01:47:48,834 --> 01:47:50,131
My daughter?

1150
01:47:51,170 --> 01:47:55,800
lf l don't do this, Mr. Suraj
will send me to the crematorium.

1151
01:47:56,175 --> 01:47:57,642
Hey, my friend!

1152
01:47:58,177 --> 01:48:00,645
One day everyone has to go there.

1153
01:48:00,846 --> 01:48:04,805
The only difference is, some people
shed tears when someone dies.

1154
01:48:04,984 --> 01:48:07,282
Where as some rejoice.

1155
01:48:07,520 --> 01:48:10,148
How dare you come here?

1156
01:48:12,191 --> 01:48:13,658
l have plenty of guts, landlord!

1157
01:48:14,193 --> 01:48:17,162
So much that no one can
stop me from going anywhere.

1158
01:48:17,363 --> 01:48:22,665
But today l've not come to
display my guts, but to beg you.

1159
01:48:24,203 --> 01:48:27,206
Take this money and
return the house document.

1160
01:48:27,206 --> 01:48:29,970
Don't render those
blind people homeless.

1161
01:48:30,209 --> 01:48:32,211
Stop talking nonsense!

1162
01:48:32,211 --> 01:48:34,547
That blind fellow sold the
house on his own will.

1163
01:48:34,547 --> 01:48:39,218
l didn't force him.
Go help them pack their bags.

1164
01:48:39,218 --> 01:48:43,348
And remember, vacate that
house before dawn, got it!

1165
01:48:45,224 --> 01:48:47,522
So much pride is not
good, landlord.

1166
01:48:48,227 --> 01:48:52,231
l'm an atheist. l've
never bowed before the lord...

1167
01:48:52,231 --> 01:48:55,200
... the first time
l'm bowing before you.

1168
01:48:56,235 --> 01:48:58,203
No, brother!

1169
01:49:00,239 --> 01:49:01,206
You!

1170
01:49:01,741 --> 01:49:03,242
What are you doing here?

1171
01:49:03,242 --> 01:49:07,008
The anklets that you had
removed from my leg...

1172
01:49:07,913 --> 01:49:10,711
... these sadists are forcing
me to wear them again.

1173
01:49:11,250 --> 01:49:14,708
Landlord, give him what he wants.

1174
01:49:16,255 --> 01:49:18,883
- l'm ready to dance.
- No!

1175
01:49:19,258 --> 01:49:22,386
- You won't do this dirty work.
- Don't stop me, brother.

1176
01:49:23,262 --> 01:49:27,221
One day you protected me from
these villagers.

1177
01:49:27,600 --> 01:49:29,268
l can't endure...

1178
01:49:29,268 --> 01:49:33,398
... my brother's head
being hung in shame today.

1179
01:49:33,606 --> 01:49:35,233
She is right.

1180
01:49:35,441 --> 01:49:38,277
You'll get the papers
only on one condition.

1181
01:49:38,277 --> 01:49:40,245
Let her dance tonight...

1182
01:49:40,946 --> 01:49:43,282
... tomorrow l'll send
the papers across.

1183
01:49:43,282 --> 01:49:45,250
Say yes, brother say yes.

1184
01:49:52,291 --> 01:49:54,627
Hey girl, here are the anklets.

1185
01:49:54,627 --> 01:49:57,596
Get ready soon.
My partner is waiting.

1186
01:49:57,963 --> 01:49:59,760
- Okay.
- Hurry up.

1187
01:50:04,303 --> 01:50:07,761
- Who are you? - Did you not
recognise? Your brother.

1188
01:50:07,973 --> 01:50:09,941
- But all this?
- Listen.

1189
01:50:10,109 --> 01:50:12,771
lf a sister can stake her
chastity for her brother.

1190
01:50:12,978 --> 01:50:14,605
Doesn't a brother has any duty?

1191
01:50:14,814 --> 01:50:18,651
These betel leaves have sleeping
doses,they'll sleep till dawn.

1192
01:50:18,651 --> 01:50:21,320
- And do as l say.
- But the one who have come with me?

01:50:22,822 --> 01:50:25,324
How long will you make me wait?

1195
01:50:25,324 --> 01:50:29,624
Call the girl soon.

01:50:43,342 --> 01:50:45,640
Who are you old man?

dust of your feet.

01:51:11,036 --> 01:51:13,372
l'll play in such a way...

1210
01:51:13,372 --> 01:51:18,377
... that you'll remember
it all your life.

1211
01:51:18,377 --> 01:51:20,675
Let the girl do something too.

1212
01:51:21,380 --> 01:51:24,717
Sir, what are these wrestlers
doing in your gathering?

1213
01:51:24,717 --> 01:51:27,386
Get rid of them so
that l can start my show.

1214
01:51:27,386 --> 01:51:29,354
Okay, disperse everyone.

''Where else will we get
an appraiser like this''

1223
01:52:32,451 --> 01:52:36,956
''Tie him to your feet
like anklets''

1224
01:52:36,956 --> 01:52:40,915
''Where else will we get
an appraiser like this''

01:53:10,489 --> 01:53:13,458
''The environment is intoxicating''

1226
01:53:14,493 --> 01:53:17,792
''Your appraier is generous''

1227
01:53:22,501 --> 01:53:25,959
''Then do whatever you want''

1228
01:53:26,505 --> 01:53:30,464
''This is a good chance''

1229
01:53:31,510 --> 01:53:36,971
''Where else will we get a
naive person like this''

1230
01:54:20,559 --> 01:54:24,017
''This wealthy man...''

1231
01:54:24,563 --> 01:54:28,192
''... is so thirsty''

1232
01:54:31,570 --> 01:54:35,529
''Then you make him drink...''

1233
01:54:35,908 --> 01:54:40,208
''... a drink full of fun''

1234
01:54:41,580 --> 01:54:45,539
''Where will we get a
ignorant man like him''

1235
01:55:26,625 --> 01:55:30,254
''My desires...''

1236
01:55:30,629 --> 01:55:33,598
''My desires are very few...''

1237
01:55:33,966 --> 01:55:37,094
''Just food and clothing''

1238
01:55:40,639 --> 01:55:44,598
''Where else will we find
a house like this''

1239
01:56:06,665 --> 01:56:10,123
- This mark.
- ls by birth.

1240
01:56:10,669 --> 01:56:13,297
- Exactly the same mark

1241
01:56:14,673 --> 01:56:19,303
- She has finished dancing,
so let go. - Wait.

1242
01:56:20,679 --> 01:56:22,681
Don't try to play any tricks.

1243
01:56:22,681 --> 01:56:25,684
This is no trick, my
heart says she is the one.

1244
01:56:25,684 --> 01:56:27,982
l'll call my wife.
Please wait here.

1245
01:56:29,688 --> 01:56:32,316
- What is it, brother?
- He must've gone to call his men.

1246
01:56:34,693 --> 01:56:37,321
Wait! Wait!
Listen.

1247
01:56:40,699 --> 01:56:42,667
Dear, where are you going?

1248
01:56:43,702 --> 01:56:45,169
Wife, look at this mark.

1249
01:56:45,370 --> 01:56:48,168
- ls this the one?
- Yes, it is! Yes!

1250
01:56:49,708 --> 01:56:51,471
Dear, who are you?

1251
01:56:51,710 --> 01:56:53,512
l am an orphan, mother.

1252
01:56:53,512 --> 01:56:59,007
At the age of 4, l got separated
from my parents in the Kumbh fair.

1253
01:56:59,218 --> 01:57:02,721
We are that ill-fated
parents, who had lost you.

1254
01:57:02,721 --> 01:57:03,688
What?

1255
01:57:06,725 --> 01:57:08,693
Yes, dear.

1256
01:57:11,730 --> 01:57:15,689
- You are my parents!
- Yes, dear.

1257
01:57:16,735 --> 01:57:18,498
- My dear.
- Mother!

1258
01:57:21,740 --> 01:57:24,208
Brother, where are you going?

1259
01:57:24,409 --> 01:57:26,745
l'm going.
l had come to steal the papers.

1260
01:57:26,745 --> 01:57:30,203
This turned out to be
my sister's house.

1261
01:57:30,749 --> 01:57:32,717
And brothers don't steal
in sisters house.

1262
01:57:39,758 --> 01:57:41,055
Wait!

1263
01:57:41,260 --> 01:57:44,263
Aren't these the papers
that you were here for?

1264
01:57:44,263 --> 01:57:46,265
The separation of my daughter
had turned me into a devil.

1265
01:57:46,265 --> 01:57:50,895
Today that devil will get
burned along with these papers.

1266
01:57:51,770 --> 01:57:55,729
You saved me from
committing a sin.

1267
01:57:56,108 --> 01:57:58,777
Son, today you have
transformed me into a man.

1268
01:57:58,777 --> 01:58:02,736
Go, go and tell them their
house won't be demolished.

1269
01:58:02,948 --> 01:58:04,745
No hotel will come up there.

1270
01:58:07,786 --> 01:58:10,254
Give them this token.

1271
01:58:10,789 --> 01:58:13,758
Even if l get life in alms
l won't take, this is just money.

1272
01:58:13,959 --> 01:58:18,760
This is not alms.
You found our lost daughter.

1273
01:58:18,964 --> 01:58:20,431
Take it!

1274
01:58:20,799 --> 01:58:23,768
One doesn't take money
for reaching his sister home.

1275
01:58:26,805 --> 01:58:28,807
Brother, take it.

1276
01:58:28,807 --> 01:58:31,275
Send your blind parents
on a pilgrimage with this money.

1277
01:58:31,476 --> 01:58:34,445
This way even our
sins will be washed away.

1278
01:58:55,801 --> 01:58:56,768
Stop.

1279
01:58:57,803 --> 01:58:59,896
Greetings, sir.

1280
01:59:00,072 --> 01:59:02,040
- lt is enroute.

01:59:06,211 --> 01:59:07,178
Drive.

1282
01:59:10,215 --> 01:59:12,775
Listen, have you seen
this man around?

1283
01:59:13,819 --> 01:59:15,446
This! This is our teacher.

1284
01:59:15,821 --> 01:59:19,450
- Teacher? Will he be at school
now? - No, he left the school.

1285
01:59:20,225 --> 01:59:22,591
- Where does he stay?
- Why? What is the matter, sir?

1286
01:59:22,828 --> 01:59:25,388
- He is wanted.
- We don't know where he stays.

1287
01:59:34,840 --> 01:59:36,068
There he is!

1288
01:59:37,843 --> 01:59:40,812
- Police is looking for our
teacher. - For our teacher?

1289
01:59:41,179 --> 01:59:42,612
- Why?
- l know.

1290
01:59:42,848 --> 01:59:45,817
- They are here to arrest him.
Let us go and tell him.- Come on.

1291
01:59:47,853 --> 01:59:51,619
- Salutations, sir. - Any news
about Mangal the fugitive?

1292
01:59:51,857 --> 01:59:54,621
We have already held him.

1293
01:59:55,260 --> 01:59:56,625
Yes, come in.

1294
01:59:56,862 --> 01:59:59,422
Sir, now will l be promoted?

1295
01:59:59,865 --> 02:00:01,332
- Where is he?
- There.

1296
02:00:02,267 --> 02:00:04,167
l told you l'm not Mangal.

1297
02:00:05,937 --> 02:00:07,768
- ls this Mangal?
- Yes, sir.

1298
02:00:08,940 --> 02:00:11,670
l told you so many times
that l'm not Mangal.

1299
02:00:11,810 --> 02:00:13,175
l'm constable Kadak Singh.

1300
02:00:13,245 --> 02:00:16,112
But they refused to
listen. Fools! lunatics.

1301
02:00:16,214 --> 02:00:19,115
Put him in and get me out.
Where are the keys?

1302
02:00:19,551 --> 02:00:21,109
How can this be, sir?

1303
02:00:21,219 --> 02:00:24,120
The posters you sent
had his picture on it.

1304
02:00:24,222 --> 02:00:25,689
- Where is that?
- Look there.

1305
02:00:32,831 --> 02:00:35,322
- lt is the handiwork of that
rascal Mangal Singh. - Yes.

1306
02:00:35,567 --> 02:00:38,536
- Should we release him?
- Yes. - No let him be here.

1307
02:00:38,837 --> 02:00:42,534
- Why sir?
- Because he is mad and wanted.

1308
02:00:43,575 --> 02:00:46,203
- He considers himself
to be a police. - Yes!

1309
02:00:46,311 --> 02:00:49,803
And somehow managed to escape
from the asylum in this uniform.

1310
02:00:49,981 --> 02:00:54,145
- He belongs to a good family.
- Yes!! - Come with me.

1311
02:00:56,988 --> 02:01:00,947
When an ants death is
near, his posters get printed.

1312
02:01:01,059 --> 02:01:05,962
Even mine have got published,
look!

1313
02:01:07,599 --> 02:01:08,964
Father, here.

1314
02:01:10,602 --> 02:01:13,070
Son, have you loaded the
bedding and suitcase?

1315
02:01:13,605 --> 02:01:16,836
- Yes father, on the roof.
- Okay.

1316
02:01:17,609 --> 02:01:20,237
- And the tiffin box?
- Tiffin box?

1317
02:01:21,012 --> 02:01:23,845
That... that l forgot
in the house, mother.

1318
02:01:24,616 --> 02:01:26,174
l'll fetch it right away.

1319
02:01:30,188 --> 02:01:33,248
- Hey Bijli! Where
are you going? - With you.

1320
02:01:33,625 --> 02:01:35,183
l'm taking them on a pilgrimage.

1321
02:01:35,293 --> 02:01:38,387
l'll also come along. This way
my sins will get washed atleast.

1322
02:01:39,030 --> 02:01:40,861
What sin have you committed?

1323
02:01:41,032 --> 02:01:43,330
Supporting a sinner is also a sin.

1324
02:01:46,638 --> 02:01:48,936
Hey! Are you running away?

1325
02:01:49,241 --> 02:01:51,402
- Going to fetch the tiffin.
- Come soon.

1326
02:01:52,644 --> 02:01:55,010
Hurry up.
The bus is about to leave.

1327
02:01:55,647 --> 02:01:58,411
Hey conductor! Wait our
teacher will be back soon.

1328
02:01:59,651 --> 02:02:02,415
Girl, be it anyone it is
time for the bus to leave.

1329
02:02:02,654 --> 02:02:05,020
lt can't wait. Get going.

1330
02:03:39,751 --> 02:03:41,116
How come you got in?

1331
02:03:42,153 --> 02:03:44,986
- l'm here!
- l thought you vanished.

1332
02:03:54,165 --> 02:03:56,133
'RAMESHWARAM'.

1333
02:03:57,369 --> 02:04:00,998
You take them in.
l'll wait outside.

1334
02:04:01,172 --> 02:04:03,333
Won't you come in, son?

1335
02:04:03,441 --> 02:04:05,341
No, mother.
l don't believe in God.

1336
02:04:05,443 --> 02:04:07,001
Don't say that, son.

1337
02:04:07,379 --> 02:04:12,009
Had God existed, your
son would've been alive today.

1338
02:04:28,800 --> 02:04:30,165
After that.

1339
02:04:30,802 --> 02:04:33,032
G...Ghost!

1340
02:04:34,406 --> 02:04:38,365
Not ghost! Call me Shravan.
l'm back!

1341
02:04:38,810 --> 02:04:40,573
Oh yes, that's him!

1342
02:04:41,813 --> 02:04:43,576
But where had you been
all these days, teacher?

1343
02:04:43,815 --> 02:04:45,942
With the fishermen, who saved me.

1344
02:04:46,818 --> 02:04:51,118
l gained consciousness after
many days, only then l realised.

1345
02:04:51,823 --> 02:04:55,953
And when l started walking,
l came here.

1346
02:04:56,428 --> 02:05:00,296
Tell me, are my parents fine?

1347
02:05:16,247 --> 02:05:17,612
Boss has called you.

1348
02:05:19,250 --> 02:05:21,081
Mangal is dead for you.

1349
02:05:21,252 --> 02:05:25,621
Not yet, but if you
refuse you will surely die.

1350
02:05:28,860 --> 02:05:31,090
Welcome, dance master.

1351
02:05:31,463 --> 02:05:32,623
Will you have betel leaf?

1352
02:05:33,264 --> 02:05:37,223
You are very good at making
betel leaves, here have some.

1353
02:05:38,870 --> 02:05:40,838
Sir, l didn't know
he was your partner.

1354
02:05:42,273 --> 02:05:45,834
Really?
Cheating me?

1355
02:05:46,277 --> 02:05:48,643
l feel like chopping you
to pieces.

1356
02:05:48,880 --> 02:05:50,848
But wonder what attachment
l have towards you?

1357
02:05:51,149 --> 02:05:53,640
- Come with us now.
- No, sir.

1358
02:05:54,886 --> 02:05:57,855
l told you the other day that
l want to leave this profession.

1359
02:05:58,156 --> 02:06:02,855
Hence you came here
to atone for your sins?

1360
02:06:04,295 --> 02:06:06,263
And l'm such a fool.

1361
02:06:06,898 --> 02:06:11,858
l thought my Mangal would be
wandering, thirsty and hungry.

1362
02:06:12,303 --> 02:06:14,134
Hence look, l brought
'rotis' for you.

1363
02:06:14,305 --> 02:06:15,670
Do you recognise it?
Eat them.

1364
02:06:16,307 --> 02:06:17,274
No.

1365
02:06:17,909 --> 02:06:21,208
These have been prepared at
the cost of poor peoples lives.

1366
02:06:21,312 --> 02:06:22,609
l don't want it.

1367
02:06:22,914 --> 02:06:24,142
'Roti' is a 'roti' after all!

1368
02:06:24,249 --> 02:06:26,046
There is a difference
in it, my friend.

1369
02:06:26,518 --> 02:06:28,319
One that is snatched
and eaten...

1370
02:06:28,319 --> 02:06:30,048
... smells of peoples blood.

1371
02:06:30,321 --> 02:06:33,290
l don't want that 'roti'

1372
02:06:33,391 --> 02:06:35,052
But l want one which l have
sweated my blood for it.

1373
02:06:35,193 --> 02:06:37,491
l don't like hearing
sermons, Mangal; come!

1374
02:06:37,595 --> 02:06:40,359
Let those blind parents
complete their pilgrimage.

1375
02:06:40,532 --> 02:06:43,899
l don't know whether they'll
complete this pilgrimage.

1376
02:06:44,135 --> 02:06:46,938
But if you refuse
to come with us...

1377
02:06:46,938 --> 02:06:50,305
... l'll send you on the
journey of death. - But sir.

1378
02:06:50,942 --> 02:06:52,170
Beat him!

1379
02:07:28,980 --> 02:07:29,947
Listen.

1380
02:07:30,582 --> 02:07:33,949
lf you exist, then
show your miracle.

1381
02:07:34,385 --> 02:07:36,353
Save me from these devils.

1382
02:07:36,988 --> 02:07:40,658
Let me help those blind parents
complete their pilgrimage...

1383
02:07:40,658 --> 02:07:42,558
... then take my life if you wish.

1384
02:08:54,065 --> 02:08:55,828
'DWARKA'

1385
02:09:06,477 --> 02:09:13,041
'J AGANATHPURl'

1386
02:09:26,097 --> 02:09:31,865
'BADRlNATH'

1387
02:09:36,274 --> 02:09:37,866
Thank you a million times, lord.

1388
02:09:38,443 --> 02:09:40,877
Now our life
has become complete.

1389
02:09:42,113 --> 02:09:43,615
Not we, but our son Ramu...

1390
02:09:43,615 --> 02:09:47,073
... should get the fruit
of this pilgrimage.

1391
02:09:48,119 --> 02:09:51,088
Yes, lord.
May he have a long life.

1392
02:09:51,522 --> 02:09:53,615
Call us to you soon.

1393
02:09:54,125 --> 02:09:56,423
So that we can meet our Shravan.

1394
02:09:56,527 --> 02:09:58,893
No, father. No!

1395
02:10:00,131 --> 02:10:01,689
Father! Father!

1396
02:10:04,135 --> 02:10:07,502
- You take them to the ashram
l'll fetch the doctor. - Okay.

1397
02:10:24,155 --> 02:10:25,520
Your wound has
healed completely.

1398
02:10:26,157 --> 02:10:27,852
This wound has healed, doctor.

1399
02:10:28,159 --> 02:10:32,163
But the real wound will heal
only after l re-arrest Mangal.

1400
02:10:32,163 --> 02:10:33,653
And send him to the gallows!

1401
02:10:33,765 --> 02:10:35,733
How do you know
that he'll come here?

1402
02:10:36,567 --> 02:10:38,125
He'll surely come here.

1403
02:10:46,577 --> 02:10:49,546
Doctor, please hurry up?
My father is unable to breath.

1404
02:10:49,647 --> 02:10:53,743
Don't worry.Often old people get
asthma attacks on such heights.

1405
02:10:54,185 --> 02:10:55,948
l'll give you the
medicine, he'll find relief.

1406
02:11:17,208 --> 02:11:18,175
Coat!

1407
02:11:55,246 --> 02:11:56,213
Here.

1408
02:11:56,748 --> 02:11:59,012
This is Mangal's picture.

1409
02:11:59,250 --> 02:12:01,548
lf you see him inform
the police station here.

1410
02:12:02,253 --> 02:12:04,221
- This is Mangal?
- Yes.

1411
02:12:06,657 --> 02:12:09,023
- He just left from here.
- What? - Yes.

1412
02:12:12,263 --> 02:12:13,230
Father, medicine.

1413
02:12:17,268 --> 02:12:18,496
Look, son.

1414
02:12:18,603 --> 02:12:22,232
Finally God pitied us.

1415
02:12:22,540 --> 02:12:24,508
He answered our prayers.

1416
02:12:24,876 --> 02:12:28,243
And sent Shravan to
us safe and sound.

1417
02:12:28,679 --> 02:12:31,842
Yes, son.
The credit goes to you.

1418
02:12:32,784 --> 02:12:35,286
Had you not got us here
with so much difficulty...

1419
02:12:35,286 --> 02:12:37,652
... how would we get our son?

1420
02:12:38,689 --> 02:12:40,020
May you be happy!

1421
02:12:40,691 --> 02:12:44,058
May you live a long life.

1422
02:12:47,698 --> 02:12:50,064
Son, why don't you speak?

1423
02:12:50,635 --> 02:12:52,637
- Why are you quiet?
- Father...

1424
02:12:52,637 --> 02:12:56,664
... perhaps he thought
l would never return.

1425
02:12:57,708 --> 02:13:02,941
Seeing me alive, he is unable
to say anything out of joy.

1426
02:13:04,315 --> 02:13:07,614
l've been waiting for
you here from the past 15 days.

1427
02:13:08,886 --> 02:13:14,085
Badrinath's journey is the
last journey, my friend.

1428
02:13:15,726 --> 02:13:18,889
Perhaps you won't believe me.

1429
02:13:19,330 --> 02:13:21,332
But honestly my friend...

1430
02:13:21,332 --> 02:13:26,292
... seeing you alive today,
my burden has reduced.

1431
02:13:26,737 --> 02:13:29,103
That l don't know.

1432
02:13:29,740 --> 02:13:32,470
But the burden of my body
has definitely reduced.

1433
02:13:36,747 --> 02:13:39,307
The killer had tried
his level best...

1434
02:13:39,750 --> 02:13:42,310
... but perhaps death
was not written in my fate.

1435
02:13:42,753 --> 02:13:44,653
Hence the fishermen saved me.

1436
02:13:44,956 --> 02:13:46,787
Forget the past, Shravan.

1437
02:13:47,358 --> 02:13:50,327
lsn't it enough that God
saved you from death?

1438
02:13:50,628 --> 02:13:53,529
Think that He gave
you another life.

1439
02:13:56,367 --> 02:13:59,370
God gave me another life
only to...

1440
02:13:59,370 --> 02:14:03,374
... repay the favours
of my friend...

1441
02:14:03,374 --> 02:14:06,343
... under which l am burdened.

1442
02:14:07,778 --> 02:14:11,737
Come my friend, l need
to talk to you in private.

1443
02:14:11,983 --> 02:14:13,143
Shravan, even l...

1444
02:14:14,385 --> 02:14:16,148
You! No.

1445
02:14:16,787 --> 02:14:18,152
Only the two of us.

1446
02:14:19,390 --> 02:14:20,357
Come.

1447
02:14:21,392 --> 02:14:24,156
Son, have food and go.

1448
02:14:24,395 --> 02:14:25,760
No, mother not now.

1449
02:14:25,997 --> 02:14:28,022
We have met after a long time.

1450
02:14:28,799 --> 02:14:31,402
Unless we don't embrace each
other and speak our hearts out...

1451
02:14:31,402 --> 02:14:34,371
... neither he nor
will l feel hungry.

1452
02:14:34,805 --> 02:14:36,705
So friend, shall we go?

1453
02:14:38,809 --> 02:14:39,776
Son...

1454
02:14:41,412 --> 02:14:42,606
Come soon.

1455
02:15:06,103 --> 02:15:10,665
l won't beg you to spare me. You
have a right to seek vengeance.

1456
02:15:10,841 --> 02:15:14,845
But Shravan, when you wanted
to pull the chain, l felt...

1457
02:15:14,845 --> 02:15:18,449
... that you are trying to
send me to the gallows...

1458
02:15:18,449 --> 02:15:21,612
... from which l had escaped,
so l couldn't control myself.

1459
02:15:22,086 --> 02:15:25,456
l... l didn't know that you
were the support of parents...

1460
02:15:25,456 --> 02:15:28,914
... who are blind and helpless
and who have no one except you.

1461
02:15:30,461 --> 02:15:31,428
Lift!

1462
02:15:32,463 --> 02:15:35,132
Shravan, lift this rifle
and pump the bullets in me...

1463
02:15:35,132 --> 02:15:37,157
... so that l attain
salvation by your hands.

1464
02:15:42,473 --> 02:15:44,031
Do you see that mountain?

1465
02:15:46,477 --> 02:15:48,240
Across that mountain
is the border.

1466
02:15:48,879 --> 02:15:53,942
Cross the border, the police
will never be able to get you.

1467
02:15:54,885 --> 02:15:55,886
You...

1468
02:15:55,886 --> 02:15:57,717
... you are leaving me?

1469
02:15:59,890 --> 02:16:02,450
- Don't you want to kill me?
- No.

1470
02:16:03,160 --> 02:16:06,061
l came to the village
with some other intention.

1471
02:16:06,497 --> 02:16:10,501
But when l learnt how
you served my parents...

1472
02:16:10,501 --> 02:16:13,265
... and how on different
occasions saved their lives.

1473
02:16:13,504 --> 02:16:17,508
ln lieu of that, even if
l had lost both my legs...

1474
02:16:17,508 --> 02:16:18,975
... l would have forgiven you.

1475
02:16:20,511 --> 02:16:22,069
The police is very close.

1476
02:16:22,913 --> 02:16:25,473
Before they arrest you
run away from here.

1477
02:16:26,117 --> 02:16:30,213
And if they get here, l'll
stop them with this rifle.

1478
02:16:31,522 --> 02:16:34,525
No, my friend one
bullet against the law...

1479
02:16:34,525 --> 02:16:37,153
... can give rise to
another Mangal like me.

1480
02:16:38,129 --> 02:16:41,758
All my life l fought my
own battle so will l, today.

1481
02:16:44,535 --> 02:16:45,502
Listen.

1482
02:16:46,537 --> 02:16:48,505
You'll need this. Take.

1483
02:16:58,549 --> 02:17:02,508
Don't tell your parents
about my reality.

1484
02:17:02,953 --> 02:17:05,786
Otherwise their love for
me might turn to hatred.

1485
02:17:05,956 --> 02:17:08,117
They know everything, Mangal.

1486
02:17:10,561 --> 02:17:13,928
They still love you very much.

1487
02:17:14,965 --> 02:17:18,264
You are so lucky to have
been born to such parents.

1488
02:17:19,570 --> 02:17:22,198
lf l'm alive tell them...

1489
02:17:23,574 --> 02:17:26,134
-... see you soon.
- Sure.

1490
02:17:33,584 --> 02:17:35,552
Hey, cheater!

1491
02:17:35,986 --> 02:17:40,047
You promised to be together
and now you are running away?

1492
02:17:40,191 --> 02:17:42,159
Bijli, you go away!

1493
02:17:42,593 --> 02:17:45,357
Where to?
l'll also come with you.

1494
02:17:45,596 --> 02:17:48,360
But l'm going in
the jaws of death.

1495
02:17:50,601 --> 02:17:53,297
Fool! You took Bijli
to be a coward?

1496
02:17:54,205 --> 02:17:57,608
l'm not your shadow to
be with you in times of joy...

1497
02:17:57,608 --> 02:17:59,576
... and disappear
in times of distress.

1498
02:18:00,211 --> 02:18:05,239
When you won't be there
what will l do? Come.

1499
02:19:28,098 --> 02:19:30,293
Look we are here to get you.

1500
02:19:30,701 --> 02:19:32,703
- Who are they?
- They are the ones...

1501
02:19:32,703 --> 02:19:35,331
... who mould small
criminals into big ones.

1502
02:19:35,706 --> 02:19:40,666
Thousands of Mangal like
me work under them. Come!

1503
02:20:11,141 --> 02:20:14,304
No! No!
What has happened?

1504
02:20:16,347 --> 02:20:18,212
Coward! You were running
away with a woman!

1505
02:20:18,749 --> 02:20:20,512
You are not brave, either!

1506
02:20:20,751 --> 02:20:22,981
Being a man you shoot a woman?

1507
02:20:23,153 --> 02:20:25,356
We knew it Mangal.

1508
02:20:25,356 --> 02:20:29,053
... that till this girl is with
you, you won't come to us!

1509
02:20:30,761 --> 02:20:33,127
l'm not in a position
to run with you.

1510
02:20:35,165 --> 02:20:36,723
Give me this rifle.

1511
02:20:37,368 --> 02:20:39,734
l... l will stop these scoundrels.

1512
02:20:40,371 --> 02:20:43,738
But... but you cross the border.

1513
02:20:44,108 --> 02:20:46,076
No Bijli, no!

1514
02:20:46,777 --> 02:20:48,335
We'll cross together.

1515
02:20:49,046 --> 02:20:52,209
Whether it is this border,
or that one.

1516
02:20:52,449 --> 02:20:57,352
Don't think, Mangal!
Throw that gun! And come to us!

1517
02:20:58,789 --> 02:21:03,556
lt seems a sound of bullet
can cause an avalanche.

1518
02:21:03,794 --> 02:21:06,558
- This is my last
warning, Mangal. - Wait!

1519
02:21:08,198 --> 02:21:09,563
What's the hurry?

1520
02:21:10,401 --> 02:21:14,167
l'll die my friend!
And so will you!

1521
02:23:09,319 --> 02:23:10,286
Mangal, you run away.

1522
02:23:19,930 --> 02:23:21,295
Mangal, you run away.

1523
02:23:23,934 --> 02:23:26,698
Wait! No one will
shoot unless l order.

1524
02:25:40,671 --> 02:25:42,161
Mangal stop!

1525
02:25:42,339 --> 02:25:43,829
Or l'll shoot!

1526
02:25:49,079 --> 02:25:53,516
- l'm feeling suffocated!
- No!

1527
02:25:54,084 --> 02:25:56,848
No, Bijli. Don't hurry up.

1528
02:25:58,088 --> 02:25:59,055
Don't!

1529
02:26:00,090 --> 02:26:01,455
We'll go together.

1530
02:26:09,099 --> 02:26:10,794
What day is it today?!

1531
02:26:11,101 --> 02:26:14,332
Mangal, today is Tuesday!!

1532
02:26:16,106 --> 02:26:21,476
- Then today Mangal
will embrace death. - No!

1533
02:26:41,531 --> 02:26:43,133
You had said...

1534
02:26:43,133 --> 02:26:48,366
... that l'd embellish your
parting with someone's blood.

1535
02:26:49,139 --> 02:26:51,107
Not someone else's blood...

1536
02:26:52,142 --> 02:26:54,906
... l've embellished your
parting with my blood!

1537
02:26:56,546 --> 02:26:57,513
Yes, Bijli.

1538
02:26:58,548 --> 02:26:59,515
Yes.

1539
02:27:03,553 --> 02:27:04,713
No!!

1540
02:27:08,158 --> 02:27:09,523
You left me, didn't you?

1541
02:27:12,162 --> 02:27:13,720
You went alone!

1542
02:27:16,767 --> 02:27:17,791
Went?

1543
02:27:22,172 --> 02:27:24,174
Didn't l tell you, inspector...

1544
02:27:24,174 --> 02:27:28,133
... that no noose in the world
can fit around Mangal's neck!

1545
02:27:29,179 --> 02:27:30,146
Empty.

1546
02:27:31,181 --> 02:27:32,739
lnspector!

1547
02:27:34,584 --> 02:27:36,142
Here are, the bullets!

1548
02:27:38,188 --> 02:27:41,419
So you aimed
an empty rifle at me!

1549
02:27:41,525 --> 02:27:43,823
lf l wanted, even
l could've fired.

1550
02:27:44,795 --> 02:27:47,864
But the burden of my sins
is so much...

1551
02:27:47,864 --> 02:27:49,832
... that in the long journey...

1552
02:27:52,202 --> 02:27:54,170
...l will be unable to carry it.

1553
02:27:58,542 --> 02:28:01,978
Don't go Bijli
even l'm coming.

1554
02:28:03,213 --> 02:28:09,584
- Where are you?
- Where are you?

1555
02:28:15,826 --> 02:28:16,793
No!

1556
02:28:17,227 --> 02:28:19,991
Mother...

1557
02:28:20,230 --> 02:28:22,698
... have you got food
for my journey?

1558
02:28:24,634 --> 02:28:26,602
All my life l've
been running after it.

1559
02:28:27,237 --> 02:28:28,704
Wonder whether l'll
get it there or no.

1560
02:28:30,240 --> 02:28:32,003
- Don't say that.
- Father.

1561
02:28:33,243 --> 02:28:36,872
l'll go there.
But l won't find Him.

1562
02:28:37,247 --> 02:28:40,250
Yet l'll find Him somehow
and tell Him, look...

1563
02:28:40,250 --> 02:28:44,710
... give heart, mind and
soul to human beings...

1564
02:28:44,855 --> 02:28:47,016
... but not this blessed stomach.

1565
02:28:47,657 --> 02:28:50,217
lf He gives a stomach
then don't give them hunger.

1566
02:28:50,761 --> 02:28:54,390
And if He gives them hunger
then arrange for their meals!

1567
02:28:54,598 --> 02:28:57,499
Otherwise you have no
right to create man!

1568
02:29:21,291 --> 02:29:26,524
See you soon!
