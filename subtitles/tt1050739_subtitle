51
00:04:36,122 --> 00:04:37,384

63

91
00:06:39,646 --> 00:06:42,843

Think about it!

187
00:11:16,856 --> 00:11:18,323
If we start a business..

There are no decent foIk Ieft

343
00:23:20,212 --> 00:23:23,511
Stop it you guys, the show's over,

How do you think I paid to make
these pipes Iook this snazzy?

355
00:23:56,148 --> 00:23:57,547
Think about it..

356
00:23:57,616 --> 00:24:01,746
With the bones we earned
from our business!

357
00:24:04,957 --> 00:24:06,822
You mean we don't have

C'mon guys..

360
00:24:10,095 --> 00:24:13,895
Those bones were not earned for us

Hmmm! Wokay!! Wokay..

686
00:47:53,584 --> 00:47:56,246
If LaiIa is mine..

692
00:48:11,268 --> 00:48:12,326

it's impossibIe to be convincing
LaiIa to be giriIfriend of Anna..

697
00:48:44,368 --> 00:48:45,426
Now Iisten up

920
01:02:29,125 --> 01:02:30,524
Anna.. Stop..

01:02:31,327 --> 01:02:32,919
CHEATER!

922
01:02:33,463 --> 01:02:34,862

01:02:34,931 --> 01:02:36,922
that LaiIa wouId be my girIfriend.

924
01:02:39,069 --> 01:02:40,536

926
01:02:44,140 --> 01:02:45,198

927
01:02:45,275 --> 01:02:48,267
But LaiIa's agreed to one more date!

928
01:02:48,344 --> 01:02:50,938
YangeIs! PAUSE!

929
01:02:54,017 --> 01:02:57,009
What did you just say?

930
01:02:57,487 --> 01:02:58,545
Repeat.

931
01:02:58,621 --> 01:02:59,883
Yes Anna!

932
01:02:59,956 --> 01:03:02,550
LaiIa's agreed to meet
you one more time!

933
01:03:02,625 --> 01:03:04,889
The next fuII moon night..

934
01:03:04,961 --> 01:03:06,019
on that shingIed roof..

935
01:03:06,096 --> 01:03:07,893
where she rehearses her dance..!

936
01:03:09,632 --> 01:03:10,894
Destiny!

937
01:03:15,505 --> 01:03:16,904

Anna! PIease! No!

942
01:03:29,986 --> 01:03:31,112
She won't do any such thing.

943
01:03:32,989 --> 01:03:34,047
Look,

944
01:03:34,124 --> 01:03:36,058
I admit the first date
was a disaster

945
01:03:36,126 --> 01:03:38,526
but she did agree to give
you a second chance!

946
01:03:39,662 --> 01:03:40,993
There must be something to it!

947
01:03:41,064 --> 01:03:42,395
The job's as good as done no Anna?

948
01:03:42,465 --> 01:03:44,933
It just needs a finaI push.

949
01:03:45,535 --> 01:03:48,060
You'II have to impress

950
