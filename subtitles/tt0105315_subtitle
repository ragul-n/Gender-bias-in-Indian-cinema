1
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:45,738
Thanks for what?

2
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:45,738
Thanks for what?

3
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:49,079
A great man like you travelled
with us in the second class!

4
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:51,741
- When do we meet now?
- Whenever you wish.

5
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:55,085
<i>I'll</i> be there.
But first let me get settled.

6
00:00:55,188 --> 00:01:00,183
Easy for you to flash your degree
and start a construction company.

7
00:01:00,693 --> 00:01:02,684
People like us need to settle.

8
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:05,197
No, my family is disciplined."

9
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:10,029
They would want me to prove myself
before they set up a company for me.

10
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:14,436
I too would want that. No point
firing the gun from their shoulders.

11
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:19,702
"That's my style. My gun,
my power and my target."

12
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:22,438
Hey, there's my car."

13
00:01:25,718 --> 00:01:28,449
It's imported. We have 4 like these.

14
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:31,713
Our servants use Fiats and Marutis.

15
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:35,053
- You've come.
- Live long son.

16
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:40,457
What are you staring at?
I grew up in his arms.

17
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:43,730
It's my duty to respect him
and ask for his blessings.

18
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,463
- Let's go. It's getting late.
- Must make a move.

19
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:56,075
What a car!

20
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,411
Your son is home.

21
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,507
- Where is he?
- He's coming.

22
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,178
- Mother!
- Stop right there.

23
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,184
Live long my son.

24
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,434
How are you? I've
been dying to see you.

25
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,441
Fine. Hale and hearty.

26
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:32,440
- God bless you.
- Finished?

27
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,037
- We'll talk leisurely.
- Have a sweet.

28
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:38,048
- No time now.
- You're always in a rush.

29
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:42,451
Our son has returned after <i>5</i> years!
Can't you spend <i>5</i> minutes with him?

30
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:45,217
You know how particular
my boss is about time.

31
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:48,223
He was good enough to give
his car to bring Deepak home.

32
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:50,452
<i>I'll</i> be late if I gossip!

33
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:53,055
Talking to your son is gossip?

34
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:58,461
Your boss knows he's come after
<i>5</i> years! A minute won't matter!

35
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:02,675
He too has a family.
I've seen him when they arrive.

36
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:05,671
"He's so excited when they come from
America, stops working and you...!"

37
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,173
I'm late for my duty!

38
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:11,673
Call your mother away
so that she spares me!

39
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:16,178
"Happiness, sorrow... nothing
stands in the way of his duty!"

40
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:20,188
He should have been in the army.
Duty plus service of the country!

41
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:23,191
- And he'd be called a soldier!
- I'm no less now.

42
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:25,520
I'm sir's driver!

43
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:32,198
I know you'll give cash.

44
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:36,202
"I've put up a board,
Cash today, credit tomorrow."

45
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:41,710
There's a ceiling and signing
a new film is very difficult.

46
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:45,211
I swear I'm adjusting you.

47
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:49,046
So you must make adjustments for me.

48
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:52,457
Simple, give and take."

49
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:59,455
Did you get it?
Great! You're so sensible!

50
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:05,161
Terrific! A few such
sensible producers...

51
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:10,172
And I can build my own house
in front of this one!

52
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:20,676
- Whose house?
- My own.

53
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,422
I mean yours.. on Madh island..

54
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:30,027
"You can do anything for yourself.
Hack my hand, throw me in a well."

55
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:34,696
The cat shuts its eyes
when it drinks milk.

56
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:38,431
And thinks nobody has seen it.
Similarly you think I know nothing.

57
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:42,198
I never said that.
I mean you know nothing.

58
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:44,706
- Since when are you with me?
- For years.

59
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:47,712
- But you've learnt nothing.
- I have.

60
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:50,709
It was something else
Turned into something else..

61
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:54,216
The producers have
been calling incessantly.

62
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:56,548
You should have said
<i>I'll</i> be there in time.

63
00:05:56,723 --> 00:06:01,661
I did say that but producers
are an impatient tribe.

64
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:05,160
Yet I said you're ready and you are.

65
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:08,493
But the driver hasn't come
and you won't leave without him.

66
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:11,660
- You know where he is?
- Yes.

67
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:14,666
He's gone to the station to
get Deepak. Must be on his way.

68
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:18,667
"His timing is perfect. Soon as
the hands reach 12, he'll be here."

69
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:21,176
There he is.

70
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:25,180
- You too should become straight
- Or we'll be late for shooting.

71
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:34,421
- Kept the bags?
- Yes.

72
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:37,019
"- Can't you say, sir?
- Yes sir."

73
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:45,433
- Morning sir.
- Deepak home? - Yes.

74
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:47,696
- Is he fine?
- Must be.

75
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,699
What? Didn't you meet him?

76
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,702
- I did.
- Didn't you ask how he is?

77
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:56,208
I'd have gotten late then.

78
00:06:56,315 --> 00:07:00,149
I was concerned about you
getting late for the shooting.

79
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:03,651
He's returned after so long
and you didn't talk to him?

80
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:07,153
<i>"L'll</i> talk to him leisurely.
Now let's go, it's late."

81
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,651
As you command sir.

82
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,664
Mother this is for you.

83
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:19,399
And this shawl is for Dad.

84
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:22,403
Did you go there to study or earn?

85
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:24,666
Where did you get so much money?

86
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:30,177
I saved the money that
Dad would send every month.

87
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:33,181
Love you son, you've grown big!"

88
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:37,014
Now quickly become a big man and
get me a sweet daughter-in-law.

89
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:40,017
Mother, your daughter-in-law..."

90
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:43,423
"Who knows where she's hiding
right now, mother."

91
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:14,655
The climes tell me...

92
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:18,659
"the clouds are moving in
somewhere"""

93
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:33,003
Birds are singing...

94
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,013
<i>I'll</i> ask them where I belong

95
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:55,430
"It blows my tresses across...
the breeze is mad"""

96
00:08:57,203 --> 00:09:05,133
"My dreams of my beloved
now tell me something"""

97
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:09,638
The climes tell me...

98
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,984
"that the clouds are
moving in somewhere"""

99
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:33,404
- What's wrong? Puncture!
- Move <i>I'll</i> check.

100
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,400
- What's the matter?
- Puncture.

101
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:42,003
Great! Fix it, we'll be back."

102
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:18,040
"The bees come singing...
and the flowers are young at heart"""

103
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:22,712
"We're young and the
times are beautiful"""

104
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:37,067
"At times like this,
I feel like going berserk"""

105
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:42,463
<i>"I'll</i> take him for my own,
whenever I meet him"""

106
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:47,229
"Who am I crazy about...?
How can I tell you right now?"""

107
00:11:57,249 --> 00:12:01,413
<i>"I'll</i> surely find him
sooner or later"""

108
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:12,173
See you, Jyoti."

109
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:15,683
Which college are you joining?

110
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:21,024
- Haven't decided.
- Let us know so we can join it.

111
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,026
- Got my phone number?
- Yes.

112
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,421
- What are you looking for?
- My mother.

113
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:31,432
- God knows if she got my letter.
- Why are you depressed about it?

114
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,699
You're no baby. Can't
you go home by yourself?

115
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,032
- Shut up!
- Is this your bag?

116
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,036
We'll get you a cab.

117
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:53,221
Why are you so late?

118
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:58,056
The traffic was bad.
How was your journey?

119
00:14:58,163 --> 00:15:01,155
How did you fare in the
exams? And how are you?

120
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:07,669
So many questions? If I answer
you now what will we talk of at home?

121
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:15,006
"We'll talk in detail later.
And the last one, see for yourself."

122
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:32,196
"- Naughty girl!
- Not naughty, mummy."

123
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:35,696
Who can argue with you!
See who has come to receive you.

124
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:42,435
"- The owl!
- Yes, Gulu."

125
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:45,204
Flowers are blooming.

126
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:49,441
Why did you get this fool?

127
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:53,708
She looks just as I'd visualised.

128
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:56,044
Fair and beautiful.

129
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,984
I couldn't refuse when he came.

130
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:04,385
Come on.

131
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:17,999
Are you hurt?

132
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:22,003
Waste of an expensive bouquet.

133
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:27,415
- Give us something!
- Take this!

134
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:37,195
Uncle!

135
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:43,027
She's hugging that old man!
But she didn't hug me!

136
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:45,126
I even bought her a bouquet!

137
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:58,439
"You've turned the house
into a tailoring shop, mummy!"

138
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:01,986
A dress designer's house
will be a tailoring shop!

139
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:04,379
Clothes all over the place!

140
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:08,483
<i>I'll</i> set everything right.
What will you drink?

141
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:11,386
Something cold.

142
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:23,165
- Dolly hasn't forgotten me.
- Neither have I.

143
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:26,410
There's a difference
between a dog and an ass.

144
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:06,644
- What happened?
- This!

145
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:14,388
Today you step into a new life.

146
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:17,385
The path of the world is
fraught with difficulties.

147
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:20,397
But don't lose hope
or be disheartened.

148
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:24,158
The fruit of success only
grows on the tree of effort.

149
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:27,395
May God grant you success.

150
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:34,673
Mother, I'm leaving."

151
00:18:35,013 --> 00:18:37,675
Eat this in the afternoon.

152
00:18:38,016 --> 00:18:40,178
<i>I'll</i> be going to posh
offices and this...

153
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:44,017
Keep it. Hotel food
will ruin your health.

154
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:48,422
- Where will you go today?
- Look at this.

155
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:53,430
- All these addresses.
- You'll go to so many places?

156
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:57,032
"- <i>I'll</i> have to mother.
- Yes, you'll have to."

157
00:18:57,302 --> 00:19:00,363
But walk in the shade.
It's terribly hot at noon.

158
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:04,132
"For me, your blessings are
the shade in the heat of life."

159
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:09,638
So why should I worry?
But I must find ajob by evening.

160
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:11,739
May that be true.

161
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,675
What's your name?

162
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,180
"- What's the scene?
- Here, read this."

163
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,687
"In the scene before this,
the heroine's Dad took her away."

164
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:03,195
He sent hoods to thrash you
But you thrashed them instead.

165
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,539
- Is the continuity fine?
- Yes.

166
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:13,701
But for a gold chain
that you'd taken home.

167
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,704
What's the name?

168
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,707
- Get the chain.
- Sure.

169
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,457
- Yes sir?
- The gold chain..

170
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,726
He's Jackie's driver.

171
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,063
What happened?

172
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,234
You carry on with the shooting.
<i>I'll</i> take him to a doctor.

173
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:49,476
Pack up the shooting.
<i>I'll</i> pay the damages.

174
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:52,473
<i>I'll</i> take him myself. Get the car.

175
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,243
Give me a hand.

176
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,532
- What happened?
- Nothing son.

177
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:22,704
- But all of you...?
- Your Dad had a shock.

178
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:25,710
But he's fine. No need to worry.

179
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:36,456
- How is Dad?
- God has been very kind or...

180
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:43,064
- But how did this happen?
- I don't know anything.

181
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:47,795
- Sir has sent this.
- What is it?

182
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:52,472
He suffered the shock
because his shoe was torn.

183
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:55,239
So sir has sent new shoes.

184
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:51,058
Who is it?

185
00:22:58,076 --> 00:23:01,011
- Has Deepak returned?
- Yes.

186
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:05,173
- Dads
- Silly boy

187
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:10,679
Why are you crying like a woman?
Life has given many such jolts.

188
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:13,180
This ordinary shock won't harm me.

189
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:17,686
Now you won't work.
I will work instead.

190
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:20,020
And you will relax.

191
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:26,035
"I won't. When such a situation
arises, you'll take charge."

192
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:33,201
But who will drive sir's
car till I get well?

193
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:36,704
- Anybody.
- No son.

194
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:41,212
Anybody won't do.

195
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:45,719
You have a driving license.

196
00:23:46,391 --> 00:23:48,223
What do you mean to say?

197
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:54,229
"Till I get better,
you will drive his car."

198
00:23:57,068 --> 00:24:02,006
' Me?
' Why?

199
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:06,508
But I'm an architect Dad.

200
00:24:07,412 --> 00:24:10,006
It won't dishonour you.

201
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:17,183
"The degree that you have,
calling yourself an architect."

202
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:20,424
This is thanks to him.

203
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:25,687
An ordinary driver like me couldn't
dream of making you an architect.

204
00:24:27,432 --> 00:24:30,197
I'm grateful to him.

205
00:24:31,536 --> 00:24:34,028
Know the difference between
being and knowing it.

206
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:37,699
You should be grateful for life.

207
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:44,444
God has given you a small
chance to repay him today.

208
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:48,213
But after studying so much..

209
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,451
- What will people say?
- You're worried about people!

210
00:24:51,723 --> 00:24:53,213
You'll be working not begging!

211
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:56,727
How can I explain to you.. Mom..

212
00:24:57,229 --> 00:24:59,721
He's right. Think about it..

213
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:02,397
I know everything.
No need for you to explain.

214
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:07,404
"Till I get well,
you have to drive his car!"

215
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:11,169
Understand this clearly.
Othenlvise do as you please.

216
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:14,401
But not in this house.

217
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:22,176
Calm down. <i>I'll</i> talk to him.

218
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:26,021
You know I hate being turned down.

219
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:29,422
He won't refuse. He's our
own blood. He will agree.

220
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:32,186
You be calm.

221
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:46,036
I've selected some drivers
as uncle won't be coming.

222
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:48,703
Each better than the other.
This is Ramprasad Yadav.

223
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:51,209
Ex-army. Strong and sturdy.

224
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:55,214
20 years of experience.
If a mob gathers at a signal..

225
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,449
One punch left and one right
and the crowd will vanish.

226
00:25:59,457 --> 00:26:01,391
He's from the military.

227
00:26:04,996 --> 00:26:09,160
This is Gulzar. Like his
name he's always smiling.

228
00:26:10,168 --> 00:26:13,502
He has 10 years experience.
Knows every corner of Bombay.

229
00:26:13,672 --> 00:26:17,006
Give him any address and
he'll get you its' history.

230
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:20,000
By God, you may leave."

231
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:26,680
You wanted the military driver
so he could also be my body guard?

232
00:26:27,018 --> 00:26:29,009
- And keep the public away?
- Absolutely right sir.

233
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:33,685
Remember the love of
public brought me here.

234
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:37,691
Should I reciprocate their
love by beating them up?

235
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,429
And what was that Gulzar?

236
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:44,196
- He's always smiling.
- Do you see someone crying here?

237
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:49,033
- Nobody sir. - And who knows
the history of Bombay better than me?

238
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:51,198
- Yes sir...
- Then...?

239
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:54,444
There's no need for you to make
decisions about my personal life!

240
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:59,040
- It was only about the driver..
- He too is a part of my life.

241
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:01,647
You'll drive the car
till he gets better.

242
00:27:02,153 --> 00:27:04,144
"' Me?
- Yes, you!"

243
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:09,150
- You...?
- Yes. I'm Deepak.

244
00:27:10,161 --> 00:27:13,392
I'll drive your car
till Dad gets better.

245
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,991
Did your Dad order or request you?

246
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:20,399
"Neither, he made me
realise my responsibility."

247
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:24,165
You're an architect.
Why did he have to make you realize?

248
00:27:24,676 --> 00:27:31,673
You know Dad. He hates any
interference in his emotions.

249
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:36,177
His emotions end with you.

250
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:38,685
That's why I'm his fan.

251
00:27:40,191 --> 00:27:41,681
Give me the keys.
This is not yourjob.

252
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:48,426
"If you let me serve you for
a while, Dad and I would be happy."

253
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,692
- For Dad's happiness..
- You'll do anything.

254
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:56,201
- It's good to obey elders but..
- I have a driving license.

255
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:58,699
You can't refuse me.

256
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:02,981
Your companions and destinations
will remain a secret in my heart.

257
00:28:03,648 --> 00:28:05,639
Uncle has prepared you well.

258
00:28:06,985 --> 00:28:08,976
<i>I'll</i> wait for you at the porch.

259
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,651
I'll sit up front with you.

260
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:19,987
You sit behind.

261
00:28:34,412 --> 00:28:37,677
- Has sir gone?
- Yes.

262
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:43,682
- Did Deepak open the door for him?
- Yes but he sat in front.

263
00:28:46,191 --> 00:28:52,426
He knows when an educated boy
is being a driver for his Dad..

264
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:55,022
How he should be respected.

265
00:28:56,434 --> 00:28:58,698
It's because of this
that I'm his slave.

266
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:03,372
I hope Deepak is successful
in this new test of his.

267
00:29:04,976 --> 00:29:07,138
Congratulations for the first division.

268
00:29:07,645 --> 00:29:12,139
I was excited about it but
uncle's accident ruined all.

269
00:29:12,984 --> 00:29:15,385
I'd planned a big
party for your success..

270
00:29:15,987 --> 00:29:18,979
I swear sir had such plans...

271
00:29:19,657 --> 00:29:21,648
I don't think I
discussed them with you.

272
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:25,152
So don't just speak up.

273
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:29,389
What are you future plans?

274
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:32,402
If I find ajob, fine."

275
00:29:33,004 --> 00:29:34,995
One should have some money.

276
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:38,404
Then <i>I'll</i> start a
construction company.

277
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:43,413
I also plan to do
something out of Bombay.

278
00:29:45,683 --> 00:29:47,674
You drive very fast.

279
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:57,424
That's fine but you must
concentrate on gear control.

280
00:29:58,196 --> 00:30:00,187
You must be in charge of
yourself and the vehicle.

281
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:08,196
I think the time is right
for you to get settled.

282
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:12,199
I mean of getting a doll.

283
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:18,206
- Doll?
- I mean a bride.

284
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:26,055
Can't say where she must be.

285
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:30,052
"- Tell me one thing.
- Yes, dear?"

286
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:34,460
"If you want to make me
a heroine, let me tell you.."

287
00:30:34,732 --> 00:30:40,068
- I'm not interested.
- I don't want you to earn.

288
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:43,063
Then where are we going?

289
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:45,472
- A party.
- What party?

290
00:30:48,746 --> 00:30:53,240
The Hong Kong stuff
that I gave you is pure.

291
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:57,483
Bangkok and Singapore
custom are corrupt.

292
00:30:57,755 --> 00:31:00,417
Do you know there was a
scam about 1.50 crores?

293
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:03,684
But I called up Bhai. The goods
will be released in 2 days.

294
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:09,023
"If we supply in time,
our name is not tarnished."

295
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,191
- What is it?
Jyoti has come.

296
00:31:11,302 --> 00:31:15,034
- What do I do with her?
- Shalini's daughter.

297
00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:19,440
- Our to be daughter-in-law!
- I thought something else.

298
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:22,203
<i>- I'll</i> get back to talk
of Hong Kong. - Come on.

299
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:29,210
Wait. Why are you offering
whisky to everybody frequently?

300
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:30,444
It's my duty.

301
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:36,718
You want me to suffer losses?
Teetotalers will start drinking!

302
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:39,219
"If they drink too much,
they will pass out."

303
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:43,458
<i>I'll</i> have to drop them home.
Spend on petrol.

304
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:48,069
So fill the glass and
stand in the dark.

305
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:53,075
You're dark so nobody can see you
Everybody will search in the dark.

306
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:58,242
- Cut out the jokes!
- My wife doesn't like jokes.

307
00:31:58,483 --> 00:32:02,010
Last time I joked our son was born!

308
00:32:08,693 --> 00:32:13,187
- Who is this?
- Don't you recognise her? My child.

309
00:32:14,198 --> 00:32:16,189
She's grown so big!

310
00:32:16,534 --> 00:32:22,200
The material of your dress
will sell well in Hong Kong.

311
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,431
Where is Gulu?

312
00:32:33,051 --> 00:32:37,716
That's my darling.
In the silver dress.

313
00:32:42,226 --> 00:32:44,718
This party is for her.

314
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:52,731
Why kiss from far? Your darling
is just here. Go and kiss her.

315
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:02,004
What are you doing? Let go!

316
00:33:02,113 --> 00:33:05,014
- I'm your Romeo.
- Ever seen yourself?

317
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:08,181
No jokes. I'm your Romeo.

318
00:33:08,686 --> 00:33:11,178
- Wash your face!
- No jokes.

319
00:33:11,689 --> 00:33:15,421
"You're my fiancee.
Come, meet my friends"

320
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:22,031
My house, cars, everything is yours."

321
00:33:22,433 --> 00:33:24,424
We'll have fun.

322
00:33:24,702 --> 00:33:27,433
My foot will marry you!

323
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:43,453
Why did you leave?
- I had no other option.

324
00:33:44,455 --> 00:33:47,720
Do you know how humiliated
Gulu and his family felt?

325
00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:51,218
Only the honourable
feel humiliation.

326
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:55,731
You call these superficial
wealthy people honourable?

327
00:33:56,234 --> 00:34:00,171
Their eyes fall on unknown
women like starving foxes!

328
00:34:00,405 --> 00:34:03,170
Whether they be their own
sisters or their mothers!

329
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:10,414
I'm not a toy or doll that
you can sell in the market!

330
00:34:10,515 --> 00:34:14,008
Now you are insulting me too!

331
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:19,016
Save yourself before
somebody insults you.

332
00:34:19,524 --> 00:34:22,016
You've started talking too much!

333
00:34:22,527 --> 00:34:27,192
The truthful person has
a sharp not long tongue.

334
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:30,697
The truth pierces the
heart like an arrow.

335
00:34:31,202 --> 00:34:35,196
Look at yourself before
preaching about truth.

336
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,202
Man creates his own name.

337
00:34:38,709 --> 00:34:43,704
"If money creates the name
you desire, I don't want it."

338
00:34:44,048 --> 00:34:49,043
What difference does it make?
Live in a cottage or a chawl.

339
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:54,722
At least your honourable folk
won't dare paw and leach at you!

340
00:34:55,726 --> 00:34:57,717
What do you want to say?

341
00:34:58,062 --> 00:35:01,657
Don't ever take me to Gulu's house.

342
00:35:01,999 --> 00:35:05,663
Why not? He's my friend's son.
They have always helped me.

343
00:35:06,003 --> 00:35:09,405
Then you be nice to
them. Why should I?

344
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:12,006
Because I want you to like him.

345
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:15,672
Gulu! It's a question of my life.

346
00:35:16,013 --> 00:35:19,005
I've given it enough thought.

347
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:23,684
They are so wealthy that
you will live well.

348
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:29,422
"If this is good life,
I'd rather do without it."

349
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:34,029
Make me a courtesan if
that's what you want.

350
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:40,427
What are you doing?

351
00:35:41,038 --> 00:35:45,032
This is what I get for
my life's efforts!

352
00:35:46,043 --> 00:35:49,206
You've seen howl brought her up!

353
00:35:49,447 --> 00:35:51,438
And she...!

354
00:35:51,716 --> 00:35:55,448
I considered her my life's support.

355
00:35:56,053 --> 00:35:59,717
"Held her and lived my life,
ruined my youth!"

356
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:05,653
Slogged day and night only for her!

357
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,396
And she...!

358
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:14,666
If you are worried about me, forget it"

359
00:36:15,406 --> 00:36:18,398
<i>- I'll</i> look after myself.
- What will you do?

360
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:23,404
<i>I'll</i> find myself a boy more
handsome and rich than Gulu.

361
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:27,413
Who will be really
respectable and honest.

362
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:31,019
There's a world of difference
between reality and dreams!

363
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:36,025
You've just seen the world.
Nobody will even look at you!

364
00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:37,526
You don't have wealth!

365
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:45,433
Your mother is right. The truth
behind your dreams is terrible.

366
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:50,031
You are young so you want to
trap the world in your fist.

367
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:53,700
But when you open our fist
the dreams would have gone.

368
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,203
And your fist will be empty.

369
00:36:56,447 --> 00:36:59,212
There's a lot of difference
between the truth and reality.

370
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:05,387
And decent girls don't talk
to their mother so loudly.

371
00:37:05,656 --> 00:37:08,387
Apologise to her now.

372
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:14,393
I'm willing to apologise
if I've committed a crime.

373
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:18,397
But I will try..

374
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:25,399
"Only if I'm not successful,
I'll marry where she wants me to."

375
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:33,179
You must give in to your
child's innocent wish.

376
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:37,684
"Fine, let her find her
honourable wealthy man."

377
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:41,187
<i>Wealth</i> will <i>come
tomorrow if not today.</i>

378
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:44,421
The seed you planted
is about to fructify.

379
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:46,686
Relax in its' shade.

380
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:51,425
I relax with you sir.
I have no other dreams.

381
00:37:51,702 --> 00:37:54,034
Quietly leave this world...

382
00:37:54,138 --> 00:37:57,199
Only cowards talk of leaving.
You must talk of living.

383
00:37:57,708 --> 00:38:00,143
- How are you feeling?
- Fine sir.

384
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:03,143
- Except for weakness.
- That's natural.

385
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:07,375
At least you could withstand it
Somebody like me would have...

386
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:15,149
"If you know somebody will take
care of you, all jolts are harmless."

387
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:19,392
I escaped thanks to you.
Or I'd have been cremated by now!

388
00:38:20,398 --> 00:38:22,992
- Have some tea sir.
- All fine?

389
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:24,994
- Need anything?
- No.

390
00:38:25,169 --> 00:38:28,161
- But I wish to say something.
- Command not ask.

391
00:38:28,406 --> 00:38:33,401
"Our son is naive, inexperienced
so forgive him if he errs."

392
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:37,003
"If you support him,
someday he'll make it big."

393
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:40,407
That he will. He's very
hardworking and sensible.

394
00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:42,676
I don't have to tell him
a thing. Thank God!

395
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:46,413
- The car is ready.
- Where are we going?

396
00:38:46,691 --> 00:38:49,023
Lawrence D'souza's shooting.

397
00:38:50,027 --> 00:38:53,691
Before that you've called the
lady journalist for an interview.

398
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:59,029
I'll join you. What did I say
He's my mobile diary.

399
00:38:59,704 --> 00:39:01,638
<i>I'll</i> take leave. See you.

400
00:39:02,373 --> 00:39:04,364
Let me know, if you need anything."

401
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:21,989
It's the climate that.

402
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,652
- Is that a star?
- She wouldn't sit here.

403
00:39:26,997 --> 00:39:29,159
Lehren!
Good one! <i>I'll</i> set the shot.

404
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:33,393
Turn the pages of
your diary of love...

405
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:37,665
"Diary, pages... Why should
one who loved just once.."

406
00:39:38,008 --> 00:39:39,999
...maintain a diary?

407
00:39:40,411 --> 00:39:45,008
- But people say..
- They do and others listen.

408
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:50,018
"If you talk openly,
it's called an affair."

409
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:52,417
Not my fault.

410
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:56,024
I was always like this. My style
hasn't changed. Nor will it change.

411
00:39:56,694 --> 00:40:01,689
"- What do you mean by style?
- When I was broke, stone broke.."

412
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:04,429
I was just like this.
Today also I am the same.

413
00:40:05,035 --> 00:40:07,436
I spoke confidently then.
I still do.

414
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:12,706
"As for girls, they don't
care how much money a man has."

415
00:40:13,444 --> 00:40:15,435
They care for his heart.

416
00:40:16,046 --> 00:40:18,538
"They want to know how he is,
what nature he possesses."

417
00:40:20,217 --> 00:40:22,049
Money is not everything.

418
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:25,712
- You are very frank.
- Man should be frank.

419
00:40:26,724 --> 00:40:31,218
Today you may feel hurt but
the truth can hurt even more.

420
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:34,460
Why should I give up
my style for anybody?

421
00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:38,458
- Shot is ready sir.
- Anything else?

422
00:41:33,724 --> 00:41:38,719
In love with me...

423
00:41:41,465 --> 00:41:44,457
waiting for me...

424
00:41:45,402 --> 00:41:49,066
"tell me the truth...
what did you really do?"""

425
00:41:50,741 --> 00:41:53,472
"I got over you sometimes,
and sometimes missed you"""

426
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:57,470
I missed you...

427
00:41:58,482 --> 00:42:01,417
I missed you

428
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:14,021
In love with me...

429
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:19,697
waiting for me...

430
00:42:20,437 --> 00:42:23,702
"tell me the truth...
what did your heart do?"""

431
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:29,035
It missed you

432
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:32,705
It missed you

433
00:43:16,193 --> 00:43:22,189
"Place your hand on my head...
and tell me once"""

434
00:43:24,034 --> 00:43:30,440
"How did you spend your days?
How did you spend your nights?"""

435
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:34,542
"I was on fire...
so was my heart"""

436
00:43:35,045 --> 00:43:38,709
"On myself,
I had no control"""

437
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:43,042
"What else will I tell you,
my love...?"""

438
00:43:43,721 --> 00:43:46,452
how I suffered at heart?

439
00:43:47,558 --> 00:43:50,220
"Every moment,
I wept for you"""

440
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:56,063
I missed you

441
00:43:56,734 --> 00:43:59,726
I missed you

442
00:44:54,458 --> 00:45:00,989
"Away from you...
I don't want to live anymore"""

443
00:45:01,999 --> 00:45:04,991
I want to forget everything...

444
00:45:06,003 --> 00:45:08,665
in love with you

445
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:13,003
You are my life...

446
00:45:13,177 --> 00:45:17,011
"you are my restlessness,
you are the one I desire"""

447
00:45:18,182 --> 00:45:20,412
Listen, my love..."

448
00:45:21,685 --> 00:45:24,177
to what my heart says

449
00:45:25,689 --> 00:45:28,681
"Don't ever be parted
from me again"""

450
00:45:31,428 --> 00:45:36,423
In love with me...

451
00:45:39,436 --> 00:45:42,701
In love with my love...

452
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:46,704
"tell me the truth...
what did your heart do?"""

453
00:45:48,779 --> 00:45:51,714
I missed you

454
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:55,441
I missed you

455
00:45:56,453 --> 00:45:59,718
I missed you

456
00:46:24,681 --> 00:46:29,175
This was my style when I was broke.
Today too it's the same.

457
00:46:29,419 --> 00:46:32,013
I spoke with confidence then.
I still do.

458
00:46:32,689 --> 00:46:37,183
"As regards girls, they don't
care how much money you have."

459
00:46:38,028 --> 00:46:43,194
They see his heart.
- He's standing in such a pose.

460
00:46:43,433 --> 00:46:46,425
Must have come to become an
actor but settled for a driver!

461
00:46:57,047 --> 00:47:00,642
- Good day.
- Good day. Yes?

462
00:47:01,585 --> 00:47:07,149
The lines on your forehead
prove you are sure to succeed.

463
00:47:07,391 --> 00:47:10,986
Fortune stands knocking at your door.

464
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:13,653
I haven't understood.

465
00:47:14,398 --> 00:47:16,389
Show me your palm.

466
00:47:17,734 --> 00:47:22,171
Wow! What lines!

467
00:47:22,406 --> 00:47:29,005
Crystal clear. Money will flow
like water gushing from a stream.

468
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:33,173
- When sire?
- Patience son.

469
00:47:33,417 --> 00:47:36,409
Patience will take you
to the heights of success.

470
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:40,183
And then only wealth!

471
00:47:43,427 --> 00:47:46,192
Hope you're not talking of
some underhand business.

472
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:52,697
"No, you're not that sort of
a boy. You are very decent."

473
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:55,198
Only you are caught
in the web of time.

474
00:47:55,439 --> 00:48:00,639
Someday a girl will
take you out of it.

475
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:03,972
<i>- Girl?
- Yes.</i>

476
00:48:04,147 --> 00:48:08,380
And you'll meet her in a
place frequented by the rich.

477
00:48:09,152 --> 00:48:12,144
But how can I go there?

478
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:16,656
Of course you can.
And maintain contact with her.

479
00:48:16,994 --> 00:48:20,658
She will drive your ill fortune away.

480
00:48:20,998 --> 00:48:25,401
Then you must marry her
And progress is yours.

481
00:48:25,669 --> 00:48:29,003
But then don't forget me.

482
00:48:29,673 --> 00:48:31,664
It's pack up time. Hurry.

483
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:36,004
Hello. I'm in a rush.
Have to take sir to the airport.

484
00:48:36,179 --> 00:48:38,671
Have to ask you something.
Meet you in a day or two.

485
00:48:38,782 --> 00:48:41,183
- But...
- It will be done.

486
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:50,417
Are you getting this dress
made for a special party?

487
00:48:52,029 --> 00:48:55,431
The Navy Ball is being
held at Centaur Hotel.

488
00:48:55,699 --> 00:49:01,138
The most handsome eligible
bachelors attend the party.

489
00:49:01,638 --> 00:49:06,633
People come there to
select their life partners.

490
00:49:07,978 --> 00:49:10,140
I always attend it.

491
00:49:10,647 --> 00:49:16,643
I am confident that my Lord
will surely stitch my torn fate.

492
00:49:17,154 --> 00:49:19,145
Isn't it?

493
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:22,984
"- Won't He?
- Yes, He will."

494
00:49:23,393 --> 00:49:25,384
Stitch it.

495
00:49:26,496 --> 00:49:30,399
Is there a pass for it?

496
00:49:33,403 --> 00:49:35,997
Is it possible that there's
no pass? Look at this invitation.

497
00:49:36,506 --> 00:49:38,668
I paid 2000 bucks for it.

498
00:49:42,412 --> 00:49:47,179
"The most handsome, eligible
bachelors attend this party!"

499
00:49:47,684 --> 00:49:52,679
Everybody goes there to
find their life partners.

500
00:49:53,423 --> 00:49:57,018
- What else is to be done?
- Take the length.

501
00:49:57,194 --> 00:49:59,185
Turn around.

502
00:50:11,441 --> 00:50:15,036
Take these. May I leave?

503
00:50:15,212 --> 00:50:18,045
- Where are you going?
- Home. - Sit down pal.

504
00:50:18,215 --> 00:50:20,047
We'll go through the mail.

505
00:50:20,217 --> 00:50:24,711
"You are strange.
So young, yet so cold."

506
00:50:25,455 --> 00:50:30,450
I don't enjoy this job.
I'm just doing my duty.

507
00:50:30,727 --> 00:50:33,059
You must be happy in every state.

508
00:50:34,464 --> 00:50:36,455
It's only when you enjoy
your work that you are happy.

509
00:50:37,467 --> 00:50:40,732
"If I'm fated to be a driver,
that's what I'm doing."

510
00:50:41,238 --> 00:50:45,072
"That reminds me, what did
tat priest say to you?"

511
00:50:45,475 --> 00:50:49,241
He was talking of things that
have no relation to reality.

512
00:50:49,746 --> 00:50:55,480
"No, he's right. Everything
he said about me has come true."

513
00:50:55,585 --> 00:50:59,488
The film industry consults him for
everything from start to release.

514
00:50:59,756 --> 00:51:01,690
What did he tell you?

515
00:51:02,692 --> 00:51:06,026
He said I'd meet a girl in a place..

516
00:51:06,696 --> 00:51:08,687
...frequented by wealthy people.

517
00:51:09,433 --> 00:51:11,424
She will change my life.

518
00:51:12,202 --> 00:51:14,193
Then <i>I'll</i> prosper.

519
00:51:14,438 --> 00:51:17,032
Catch hold of a girl and marry her.

520
00:51:17,207 --> 00:51:22,202
She will be found in some posh
place. How can I go there?

521
00:51:24,314 --> 00:51:27,215
You've got it made! By God!

522
00:51:27,551 --> 00:51:31,044
Here's the Navy Charity
Ball program. Go on.

523
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:33,048
- But..
- No buts.

524
00:51:33,223 --> 00:51:37,456
God desires it. That is why
the card is here and sir outdoor.

525
00:51:41,731 --> 00:51:45,224
You look as if I'm talking to myself.

526
00:51:46,069 --> 00:51:48,060
What's the use?

527
00:51:49,072 --> 00:51:52,736
I don't have the clothes
to go to such places.

528
00:51:53,076 --> 00:51:57,240
Is that a problem? Come with me.

529
00:52:02,686 --> 00:52:04,176
Come in.

530
00:52:07,424 --> 00:52:09,017
Come on.

531
00:52:12,195 --> 00:52:16,029
These are of Ram Lakhan...
These of Hero..

532
00:52:18,034 --> 00:52:20,196
Select any fabulous suit.

533
00:52:20,437 --> 00:52:24,431
But these belong to sir.

534
00:52:25,041 --> 00:52:27,032
<i>- So?
- No.</i>

535
00:52:27,444 --> 00:52:31,438
- I can't do this. - You look
as if you've witnessed a murder!

536
00:52:31,715 --> 00:52:34,446
- I
- No point being afraid.

537
00:52:34,718 --> 00:52:37,050
These are shooting clothes.

538
00:52:37,454 --> 00:52:42,051
This is an emperor's cupboard.
And sir is an emperor.

539
00:52:42,225 --> 00:52:45,217
"Once he wears and discards
a dress, it's discarded."

540
00:52:45,462 --> 00:52:47,226
Does he remember his clothes?

541
00:52:47,564 --> 00:52:49,726
- But...
- No buts.

542
00:52:50,066 --> 00:52:53,229
I too wear his clothes.
Alter them and they fit.

543
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:55,461
Has he ever found out? No.

544
00:52:55,739 --> 00:53:00,176
I'm always flitting in
front of his eyes.

545
00:53:00,277 --> 00:53:03,008
But he hasn't noticed.
Don't worry. Take this.

546
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:07,014
You won't get this chance again.

547
00:53:07,417 --> 00:53:11,012
I've got the clothes and the card.

548
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:14,680
But what about cash?
- That too will be organised.

549
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:21,021
Flash it at any <i>5</i> star hotel.
It will be accepted.

550
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:23,428
And you have sir's imported car.

551
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:28,536
Go like a prince and return
like a king with his queen.

552
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:37,045
Listen... if your fate smiles
employ me as a part time secretary.

553
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:40,710
<i>I'll</i> be with sir in the day
and you during the evening.

554
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:44,711
You'll roll in gold and I in silver!

555
00:54:19,689 --> 00:54:22,181
- She's beautiful.
- He's handsome.

556
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:25,194
The car must cost at least 500000.

557
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:28,424
The car is grand. Must be rich.

558
00:54:29,032 --> 00:54:31,694
The queen of my dreams
should be like her.

559
00:54:32,702 --> 00:54:35,194
He's more handsome than Gulu.

560
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:40,442
"If I get her, nobody can
stop me from succeeding."

561
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:44,436
Madam please remove your car.

562
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:47,041
Take it.

563
00:54:53,056 --> 00:54:55,457
We won't let anyone in
without seeing the card.

564
00:54:55,725 --> 00:55:00,993
I kept the card in this!
I paid 2000 for it!

565
00:55:01,097 --> 00:55:05,159
Stand aside and look for your card.

566
00:55:05,402 --> 00:55:09,396
Don't you recognise me?
I'm Piloo Wadia.

567
00:55:12,509 --> 00:55:15,001
Everybody knows me.

568
00:55:22,419 --> 00:55:26,686
I've seen you earlier.
- Possible.

569
00:55:27,691 --> 00:55:30,683
- Who are you?
- I...

570
00:55:31,428 --> 00:55:34,420
I'm from the family of
King Ranjit Singh of Jaipur.

571
00:55:35,031 --> 00:55:38,433
"She's a princess.
Be careful, Deepak."

572
00:55:39,035 --> 00:55:41,026
This opportunity won't come again

573
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:46,205
Then I must have positively
seen you somewhere.

574
00:55:46,443 --> 00:55:48,537
Why are you bothering us madam?

575
00:55:48,712 --> 00:55:52,444
Let me go in or <i>I'll</i> remain
a spinster all my life!

576
00:56:02,992 --> 00:56:07,156
She's alone. Join her
before somebody else does.

577
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:27,674
What a co-incidence.
My name is Deepak and your's Jyoti.

578
00:56:29,686 --> 00:56:31,677
- May I sit here?
- Pardon?

579
00:56:41,197 --> 00:56:45,031
- Do you live in Bombay?
- Yes.. - Where?

580
00:56:46,035 --> 00:56:50,199
Actually I keep coming
here to a friend's house.

581
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:52,701
My permanent address...

582
00:56:56,446 --> 00:57:00,144
- How did you know?
- You said so outside.

583
00:57:00,483 --> 00:57:02,975
You belong to the family of
Kind Ranjit Singh of Jaipur.

584
00:57:03,153 --> 00:57:06,987
- Yes and you...?
- I? I'm from Bombay.

585
00:57:07,657 --> 00:57:13,994
"But business has grown so much that
I'm in London, Japan, or America."

586
00:57:14,397 --> 00:57:16,991
My business is spread
all over the world.

587
00:57:25,175 --> 00:57:27,667
Do you measure your words?

588
00:57:28,178 --> 00:57:33,673
- Why? - Because only
I'm speaking. You only agree.

589
00:57:36,019 --> 00:57:39,683
That's because it's our first meeting.

590
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:44,184
I open up very gradually.

591
00:57:44,527 --> 00:57:50,432
"To tell the truth, after
seeing you I feel as if.."

592
00:57:51,434 --> 00:57:53,425
I know you well.

593
00:57:54,204 --> 00:57:56,696
- You seem familiar.
- And...?

594
00:57:57,707 --> 00:58:00,142
I too feel I know you.

595
00:58:05,181 --> 00:58:07,980
Watch what fate has in store for you.

596
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:11,647
Watch what fate has in store for you.

597
00:58:12,388 --> 00:58:15,153
She sits before me
with desire in her eyes.

598
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:19,652
This beautiful evening
of the Navy Charity Ball...

599
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:23,398
...is adorned by two
famous loved artists.

600
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:30,163
And we hope and are confident
that the magic in their voice..

601
00:58:30,273 --> 00:58:32,674
...will have you tapping
your feet in no time.

602
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:40,177
Hold on to your hearts because
they will present a lovely duet.

603
00:58:40,416 --> 00:58:45,411
These famous artists are
Kumar Sanu and Alka Yagnik.

604
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:50,683
And this beautiful song has been
set to music by Nadeem-Shravan.

605
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:44,412
Just one prayer I have of God...

606
00:59:44,681 --> 00:59:48,174
"from among the love every
man offers you..."""

607
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:52,685
"may you take a liking
to my love"""

608
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:58,190
"May you take a liking
to my love"""

609
01:00:23,052 --> 01:00:26,454
I have just one prayer of God...

610
01:00:26,723 --> 01:00:30,455
"from among the friendship
of all friends..."""

611
01:00:30,727 --> 01:00:34,459
"you take my friendship
to be the best"""

612
01:00:36,566 --> 01:00:40,230
"May you take my friendship
to be the best"""

613
01:01:07,196 --> 01:01:13,533
"You are like a poem,
coloured in beauty"""

614
01:01:22,712 --> 01:01:29,049
"You are the Lotus that blossoms
in the Ocean of Love"""

615
01:01:30,553 --> 01:01:33,545
"Just one prayer I have
of God...

616
01:01:34,057 --> 01:01:37,550
Among all poets...

617
01:01:38,061 --> 01:01:42,464
may my couplets appeal to you

618
01:01:52,075 --> 01:01:55,238
Just this prayer of God...

619
01:02:22,705 --> 01:02:28,701
"In my heart,
is a picture of yours"""

620
01:02:38,054 --> 01:02:44,050
You have now come to be my life

621
01:02:46,062 --> 01:02:48,724
Just this prayer of God...

622
01:02:49,465 --> 01:02:52,730
in everything simple...

623
01:02:53,469 --> 01:02:57,463
"may my simplicity appeal
to you the most"""

624
01:03:41,717 --> 01:03:48,054
"Ever since I looked into your eyes,
I'm on a high"""

625
01:03:56,799 --> 01:04:03,171
"Day and night,
I pine for you"""

626
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:07,999
I pray to God...

627
01:04:08,411 --> 01:04:11,676
among the craziest of them all...

628
01:04:12,181 --> 01:04:16,175
"may you find me to be
the craziest"""

629
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:29,188
Just one prayer I have of God...

630
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:33,192
"from among the love every
man offers you..."""

631
01:04:33,436 --> 01:04:37,430
"may you take a liking
to my love"""

632
01:04:39,442 --> 01:04:43,208
"May you take a liking
to my love"""

633
01:04:47,049 --> 01:04:51,213
May you like my couplets

634
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:58,718
May you like my friendship

635
01:05:00,663 --> 01:05:03,394
Okay, I must leave now."

636
01:05:03,666 --> 01:05:05,657
Leaving so early?

637
01:05:06,669 --> 01:05:09,161
I am not permitted
to stay out so late.

638
01:05:09,672 --> 01:05:12,164
And I'm alone tonight.
What about you?

639
01:05:13,009 --> 01:05:15,671
This function holds no interest
for me once you leave.

640
01:05:17,013 --> 01:05:21,177
And I get plenty of out
of India calls at night.

641
01:05:21,684 --> 01:05:23,675
Because it's day there
when it's night here.

642
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:28,186
And work before pleasure.

643
01:05:30,192 --> 01:05:32,183
Would you like to be friends with me?

644
01:05:33,195 --> 01:05:36,187
Why not? If you would like it.

645
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:41,029
I would love to.
So when do we meet?

646
01:05:42,204 --> 01:05:44,036
Whenever you are free.

647
01:05:44,206 --> 01:05:47,198
- Give me your telephone number.
- Sure.

648
01:05:53,449 --> 01:05:55,440
I've fixed it in the
computer of my heart.

649
01:05:55,718 --> 01:06:00,053
- And your number?
- What's the use?

650
01:06:00,489 --> 01:06:02,480
I can be contacted only
if I remain in one spot.

651
01:06:02,658 --> 01:06:05,389
Your fingers would ache dialing.

652
01:06:05,995 --> 01:06:10,990
I don't know where <i>I'll</i> be
but I know where you'll be.

653
01:06:11,667 --> 01:06:14,159
- Isn't that true?
- True.

654
01:06:16,005 --> 01:06:18,406
See you. We'll keep meeting.

655
01:07:18,334 --> 01:07:20,393
I had a picture in my heart...

656
01:07:21,170 --> 01:07:23,161
you are what I always desired

657
01:07:24,173 --> 01:07:28,667
Will you be my friend?

658
01:07:42,525 --> 01:07:46,428
"I had a picture in my heart...
you are what I always desired"""

659
01:07:46,695 --> 01:07:51,189
Will you be my friend?

660
01:08:29,171 --> 01:08:31,663
"You are the one
my heart desires..."""

661
01:08:33,008 --> 01:08:36,000
"I don't know what has
gotten into me"""

662
01:08:49,024 --> 01:08:56,192
"Without you, I won't be able
to live; that's what I now think"""

663
01:08:57,199 --> 01:09:01,136
"I'm crazy at heart...
you are now my goal"""

664
01:09:01,370 --> 01:09:05,637
Cast a loving glance at me

665
01:09:34,336 --> 01:09:36,998
She fooled me and took my car!

666
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:40,006
What? What is he saying?

667
01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:43,009
He's lying. I didn't.

668
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:47,673
"In fact, he stopped his car
near another and said he's coming."

669
01:09:48,184 --> 01:09:53,179
I thought he's gone to get
ice cream but he just vanished.

670
01:09:53,689 --> 01:09:57,023
- I waited for an hour. Uncle..
- Yes?

671
01:09:57,626 --> 01:10:02,427
You know how people stare
at a girl sitting all alone.

672
01:10:02,698 --> 01:10:05,190
Like this... And hoods.

673
01:10:07,770 --> 01:10:10,705
"- This is a lie..
- Mummy, he's lying."

674
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:14,199
I left after an hour.
What could I do?

675
01:10:14,443 --> 01:10:16,434
Why didn't you tell me?

676
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:22,450
"You like him. Had I told you,
you would have been hurt."

677
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:26,211
This is very wrong.
You shouldn't have done that.

678
01:10:26,455 --> 01:10:29,720
I didn't. She is lying.

679
01:10:30,059 --> 01:10:34,553
He doesn't remember anything.
Forgets in just a minute!

680
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:37,222
What did I just tell mummy?

681
01:10:37,733 --> 01:10:41,465
"You <i>---</i> Gulu. Had I told
you, you would have been --."

682
01:10:41,737 --> 01:10:43,728
Fill in the blanks.

683
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:46,731
You <i>---</i> Gulu.

684
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:49,234
"Had I told you,
you would be --."

685
01:10:56,085 --> 01:11:00,079
"Gulu likes you. Had I told you,
you would think it's a lie."

686
01:11:00,189 --> 01:11:02,180
Wrong! Absent minded man!

687
01:11:02,691 --> 01:11:08,186
"I said, you like Gulu. Had I told
you, you would have been hurt."

688
01:11:09,031 --> 01:11:12,023
If this is true, I'm sorry."

689
01:11:12,434 --> 01:11:17,031
<i>- I'll</i> treat you to natural
ice cream. - What did you say?

690
01:11:17,206 --> 01:11:22,440
It's a shop. And I promise
not to alight from the car.

691
01:11:22,711 --> 01:11:26,443
- I don't want your ice cream.
- The past is forgotten.

692
01:11:26,715 --> 01:11:29,446
I've apologised so the fight ends.

693
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:34,451
Nothing is over. I won't go with you

694
01:11:34,723 --> 01:11:36,714
I love my self respect.

695
01:11:37,059 --> 01:11:40,051
She is angry for no reason.

696
01:11:45,067 --> 01:11:48,731
This is Deepak.
- How are you?

697
01:11:50,072 --> 01:11:53,064
What? I'm Deepak.

698
01:11:54,076 --> 01:11:57,478
- I know.
- Got it. Somebody around?

699
01:11:57,813 --> 01:12:01,408
- Yes.
- Then <i>I'll</i> call later.

700
01:12:01,684 --> 01:12:03,675
No. You can talk.

701
01:12:04,019 --> 01:12:07,011
- I want to meet you.
- When?

702
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:09,687
- Now.
- Where are you calling from?

703
01:12:10,192 --> 01:12:13,423
>From Hotel Taj Mahal.

704
01:12:15,431 --> 01:12:18,025
- Do you know Natural Ice Cream?
- Yes.

705
01:12:19,034 --> 01:12:21,696
But it will take me
half an hour to reach.

706
01:12:22,237 --> 01:12:24,228
<i>I'll</i> meet you there.

707
01:12:29,545 --> 01:12:32,446
I'm ready for that ice cream.

708
01:12:34,717 --> 01:12:39,450
Because I don't want mummy
to be hurt by my refusal.

709
01:12:39,722 --> 01:12:42,054
<i>I'll</i> go and change.

710
01:12:43,726 --> 01:12:45,455
<i>I'll</i> be in the car.

711
01:13:07,416 --> 01:13:09,680
Go and get the ice cream.

712
01:13:11,420 --> 01:13:14,412
- You get it.
- Won't you feel ashamed?

713
01:13:15,023 --> 01:13:22,020
- Why should I?
- The girl buys while the boys sits?

714
01:13:24,199 --> 01:13:27,692
I promised aunt I wouldn't
alight from the car.

715
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:34,205
- Don't abuse me.
- Then get the ice cream.

716
01:13:35,444 --> 01:13:38,038
<i>I'll</i> get it if you say.

717
01:13:38,714 --> 01:13:42,048
But don't tell aunt
I got out of the car.

718
01:13:42,551 --> 01:13:44,713
Okay. Now go.

719
01:13:46,221 --> 01:13:48,212
Which one should I get?

720
01:13:51,059 --> 01:13:54,051
The one you like.
- The one I like!

721
01:14:07,009 --> 01:14:09,000
Move on!

722
01:14:09,111 --> 01:14:13,673
- But who is that monkey?
- He... he's my body guard.

723
01:14:15,417 --> 01:14:20,412
That's because many people
chase you for your wealth.

724
01:14:20,689 --> 01:14:22,680
So Mummy sent him along.

725
01:14:23,425 --> 01:14:28,192
I see. But if I grab your wealth?

726
01:14:29,031 --> 01:14:31,193
I'll grab yours!

727
01:14:32,434 --> 01:14:34,425
Let's go before he comes.

728
01:14:39,441 --> 01:14:41,432
They've taken the car and Jyoti!

729
01:14:45,447 --> 01:14:47,438
Stop! My Jyoti is inside!

730
01:14:50,219 --> 01:14:52,210
My ice cream too is gone!

731
01:15:21,016 --> 01:15:26,182
In love with me...

732
01:15:29,024 --> 01:15:32,016
in love with me...

733
01:15:33,028 --> 01:15:36,191
"tell me the truth...
what did you do?"""

734
01:15:38,033 --> 01:15:41,025
I missed you

735
01:15:42,037 --> 01:15:45,029
I missed you

736
01:15:46,041 --> 01:15:49,033
I missed you

737
01:15:56,218 --> 01:16:01,156
In love with me...

738
01:16:03,992 --> 01:16:06,984
waiting for me...

739
01:16:07,663 --> 01:16:11,395
"tell me the truth...
what did your heart do?"""

740
01:16:13,402 --> 01:16:16,394
I missed you

741
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:20,398
I missed you

742
01:17:03,151 --> 01:17:09,648
"Place a hand on my head...
and tell me"""

743
01:17:11,493 --> 01:17:17,660
"How did you spend your days?
How did you spend your nights?"""

744
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:26,169
"I was on fire, so was my heart.
I had no control over myself"""

745
01:17:27,175 --> 01:17:33,410
"What else I will tell you
how I suffered at heart, my love"""

746
01:17:35,017 --> 01:17:37,679
Every moment, I wept for you"

747
01:17:41,023 --> 01:17:46,018
To meet me...

748
01:17:49,031 --> 01:17:51,693
in love with me, my love..."

749
01:17:52,701 --> 01:17:56,194
"tell me the truth...
what did you do?"""

750
01:17:58,206 --> 01:18:01,141
I missed you

751
01:18:01,977 --> 01:18:05,140
I missed you

752
01:18:59,434 --> 01:19:05,965
"I don't want to live
away from you anymore"""

753
01:19:07,142 --> 01:19:13,639
"I want to forget everything
in love with you"""

754
01:19:14,382 --> 01:19:17,977
You are my life

755
01:19:18,487 --> 01:19:21,923
"You are my desire;
you cause me restlessness"""

756
01:19:21,990 --> 01:19:29,397
"Listen what my heart
says to you, my love"""

757
01:19:30,999 --> 01:19:33,991
Don't ever part from me again

758
01:19:36,671 --> 01:19:41,404
In love with me...

759
01:19:44,412 --> 01:19:47,404
In love with me, my love..."

760
01:19:48,416 --> 01:19:51,681
what did you do?

761
01:19:54,189 --> 01:19:57,022
I missed you

762
01:19:57,692 --> 01:20:01,026
I missed you

763
01:20:35,730 --> 01:20:37,459
- Stop!
- Why?

764
01:20:37,799 --> 01:20:44,068
Because I won't be allowed out
if I'm seen with a strange boy.

765
01:20:44,739 --> 01:20:48,733
And I don't know what a scene
the body guard would have created.

766
01:20:51,813 --> 01:20:54,077
- When can we meet next?
- Whenever you wish.

767
01:20:54,749 --> 01:20:57,741
Wait for my call.

768
01:20:58,086 --> 01:21:00,521
I have no job but
to wait for your call.

769
01:21:08,430 --> 01:21:13,197
"- Now you must go.
- No, first enter the gate."

770
01:21:14,035 --> 01:21:16,026
Then <i>I'll</i> leave.

771
01:21:20,709 --> 01:21:22,700
- Stand up.
- What's wrong?

772
01:21:24,045 --> 01:21:25,535
- Take this.
- What's this?

773
01:21:25,647 --> 01:21:27,638
Salute me.

774
01:21:33,054 --> 01:21:34,385
- Open the gate.
- But...

775
01:21:34,556 --> 01:21:36,547
Is it less? Here's more.

776
01:21:37,225 --> 01:21:40,718
Got it. Please come in.

777
01:21:54,242 --> 01:21:55,732
Stop.

778
01:21:57,746 --> 01:21:59,737
7 Bungalows. Fast.

779
01:22:02,350 --> 01:22:05,411
I bow in your presence.

780
01:22:06,421 --> 01:22:10,187
Your support helps me.

781
01:22:10,425 --> 01:22:14,692
You are the beacon of light
that guides the lost.

782
01:22:17,432 --> 01:22:18,695
Who is lost?

783
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:22,202
- Sir...?
- Me?

784
01:22:23,038 --> 01:22:28,204
- No sir.
- Then who are you talking about?

785
01:22:28,443 --> 01:22:30,434
Nobody in particular.

786
01:22:30,712 --> 01:22:33,704
I was lost in the
path of my arrogance.

787
01:22:34,215 --> 01:22:37,207
But your love showed me
the way to live.

788
01:22:37,719 --> 01:22:43,214
Everybody can guide but
the right man says the truth.

789
01:22:43,725 --> 01:22:48,458
That's what I mean. Your
style and advice is effective.

790
01:22:48,797 --> 01:22:51,232
So that's what you were
telling my photograph?

791
01:22:51,566 --> 01:22:55,059
No sir. I mean I can't
say it to your face.

792
01:22:55,470 --> 01:23:00,408
You assume wrong. A man who
speaks behind one's back..

793
01:23:01,009 --> 01:23:03,000
He is a traitor.

794
01:23:04,012 --> 01:23:06,504
- I hope you are..
- I'm not among them.

795
01:23:07,682 --> 01:23:11,676
Good you didn't praise me to
my face. I don't like such men.

796
01:23:12,020 --> 01:23:15,183
Our industry has one word for them.

797
01:23:16,024 --> 01:23:20,018
I prefer eating with my hands.
Spoons go into all mouths. Right?

798
01:23:21,029 --> 01:23:25,023
Your style of dressing
isjust like mine.

799
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:27,428
Obviously.

800
01:23:30,772 --> 01:23:34,709
Inspiration is fine.
But man should have his own style.

801
01:23:35,210 --> 01:23:38,202
"If he copies others,
it has no importance."

802
01:23:39,047 --> 01:23:41,209
I forgot to tell you...

803
01:23:42,050 --> 01:23:44,041
You look like a hero in these.

804
01:23:46,721 --> 01:23:51,716
Listen. I've worn
this suit in some film.

805
01:23:52,227 --> 01:23:54,719
I might need it. Bring it back.

806
01:23:57,065 --> 01:24:00,660
- I'm very happy today.
- There must be a reason.

807
01:24:03,004 --> 01:24:05,166
Yes, there is a reason."

808
01:24:06,007 --> 01:24:10,001
"- Then tell me about it.
- If I do, you'll claim credit."

809
01:24:10,412 --> 01:24:13,507
- Is it about our son?
- Yes.

810
01:24:14,182 --> 01:24:16,674
I'm proud of my son.

811
01:24:17,185 --> 01:24:23,522
A qualified architect is
fulfilling his father's duties.

812
01:24:24,426 --> 01:24:27,191
But I feel sorry to see him drive.

813
01:24:27,429 --> 01:24:31,423
No point. Today he understands
the reality of life.

814
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:35,693
He is not ashamed to
be a driver today.

815
01:24:37,205 --> 01:24:39,196
He won't be dependent on anyone.

816
01:24:39,441 --> 01:24:44,709
He stands on his own feet.
He can face anyone.

817
01:24:47,215 --> 01:24:52,051
Are you going for a
fancy dress competition?

818
01:24:52,454 --> 01:24:57,051
Mummy would have stitched you a
monkey suit or a clown's dress.

819
01:24:57,459 --> 01:25:00,986
I'm going to dance.

820
01:25:01,396 --> 01:25:05,162
I have two passes. For you and me.

821
01:25:07,001 --> 01:25:08,992
I go with you?

822
01:25:12,006 --> 01:25:17,410
I don't want to make a
spectacle of myself with him.

823
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:21,071
No, my stomach has a headache."

824
01:25:24,185 --> 01:25:26,677
I'm going bonkers with you!

825
01:25:27,422 --> 01:25:29,413
What I mean to say and what I say!

826
01:25:29,624 --> 01:25:31,615
I won't go with you!

827
01:25:32,026 --> 01:25:34,017
Please tell her.

828
01:25:41,202 --> 01:25:43,193
It's me. What are you doing?

829
01:25:43,438 --> 01:25:45,031
- Nothing.
- Coming to the dance?

830
01:25:45,373 --> 01:25:49,207
- If you are with me.
- Meet me at Sarvodaya.

831
01:25:49,544 --> 01:25:52,707
<i>I'll</i> wait at the gate.

832
01:25:58,052 --> 01:26:04,150
I can't refuse you when you request.

833
01:26:04,993 --> 01:26:10,659
- What?
<i>- I'll</i> come if you insist.

834
01:26:12,167 --> 01:26:15,398
Behave yourself. <i>I'll</i> change.

835
01:26:19,407 --> 01:26:22,172
- I'm in the car!
- He's crazy.

836
01:26:43,431 --> 01:26:45,422
Go and park the car.

837
01:26:46,434 --> 01:26:49,199
Wait here. <i>I'll</i> quickly park the car.

838
01:27:00,982 --> 01:27:02,973
Has the fool gone?

839
01:27:05,653 --> 01:27:08,645
- Your pass?
- It's with her.

840
01:27:08,990 --> 01:27:12,392
- Get lost.
- I have to go in.

841
01:27:17,398 --> 01:27:19,662
What are you doing?
My darling is in.

842
01:27:51,432 --> 01:27:55,027
"My heart is crazy.
It won't relent"""

843
01:27:55,536 --> 01:27:59,200
"Nobody realises how
restless I feel"""

844
01:28:08,483 --> 01:28:14,388
"It has robbed my eyes
of all my sleep"""

845
01:28:21,663 --> 01:28:26,999
"It has made my life difficult...
my dream of my beloved"""

846
01:28:43,418 --> 01:28:47,184
All night, they make me suffer"

847
01:28:47,689 --> 01:28:51,182
They make me pine

848
01:29:00,468 --> 01:29:06,635
It has taken away my peace...

849
01:29:13,648 --> 01:29:18,984
"They've made life difficult...
dreams of my beloved"""

850
01:29:50,418 --> 01:29:52,409
You are standing here!
I've been at the gate...!

851
01:30:13,207 --> 01:30:17,041
"With a red scan'
covering her head..."""

852
01:30:21,449 --> 01:30:25,215
<i>"I'll</i> bring her home,
as my bride"""

853
01:30:29,791 --> 01:30:33,455
She lingers in my breath...

854
01:30:33,728 --> 01:30:37,221
her picture, I hold in my eyes"

855
01:30:37,565 --> 01:30:41,229
In my eyes...

856
01:30:46,808 --> 01:30:51,746
"Our bridal bed will one day
be becked up with flowes"""

857
01:30:58,753 --> 01:31:04,021
"They bring the fragrant Spring...
my dreams of my beloved"""

858
01:31:50,071 --> 01:31:55,475
"Dreams of my beloved
have made life difficult for me"""

859
01:32:19,367 --> 01:32:24,430
"Dreams of my beloved
have made life difficult for me"""

860
01:32:34,048 --> 01:32:36,210
Dreams of the beloved

861
01:32:53,601 --> 01:32:58,095
The delicate hands of
girls can hit so hard!

862
01:32:58,339 --> 01:33:00,330
Why don't you tell me
where you're hurt?

863
01:33:00,942 --> 01:33:04,105
I can't tell you.

864
01:33:10,351 --> 01:33:13,946
- Look at him!
- You wore a suit in the morning.

865
01:33:14,355 --> 01:33:18,121
Yes. My friend, Lobo is my size."

866
01:33:18,359 --> 01:33:21,124
He liked my suit. I told
him it's from Hong Kong.

867
01:33:22,630 --> 01:33:24,621
- So you gave it to him?
- Not for free.

868
01:33:25,132 --> 01:33:28,966
I bought it for 3500
and sold it for 7500.

869
01:33:29,136 --> 01:33:31,127
Made a profit of 4000.

870
01:33:31,472 --> 01:33:33,634
And came home like this!
Weren't you ashamed?

871
01:33:34,141 --> 01:33:39,978
"What for? You can't see the
bottom in a car, just the top."

872
01:33:40,147 --> 01:33:43,139
people must have thought
Jackie Shroff is driving by.

873
01:33:48,155 --> 01:33:51,591
- Have you seen your face?
<i>- I'll</i> see that later.

874
01:33:51,926 --> 01:33:54,088
First tell me what
happened to his face?

875
01:33:54,328 --> 01:33:56,319
- He got beaten.
- Beaten?

876
01:33:56,430 --> 01:33:59,593
It hurts a lot!

877
01:33:59,934 --> 01:34:04,098
Stop your colourful program
and tell me who beat you.

878
01:34:04,338 --> 01:34:08,104
<i>I'll</i> call up some hoods.
This is the only piece I have.

879
01:34:08,342 --> 01:34:10,333
And the public turned him
into a department store!

880
01:34:11,112 --> 01:34:13,342
Who spoilt his face?

881
01:34:13,948 --> 01:34:17,111
- Jyoti got him bashed.
- No.

882
01:34:17,618 --> 01:34:22,351
- Then? - I touched a
girl thinking it was Jyoti.

883
01:34:22,623 --> 01:34:26,355
You will get bashed if
you dial a wrong number.

884
01:34:27,628 --> 01:34:29,619
Cut out the joke!

885
01:34:30,965 --> 01:34:32,956
Was Jyoti with you?

886
01:34:33,634 --> 01:34:37,468
"Yes, she was roaming
with along haired man."

887
01:34:37,638 --> 01:34:40,369
Get his head checked.
He's out of his senses!

888
01:34:40,641 --> 01:34:44,475
- Or <i>I'll</i> take him to Hong Kong.
- No!

889
01:34:44,979 --> 01:34:46,970
<i>I'll</i> stay here because
my Jyoti is here!

890
01:34:49,650 --> 01:34:51,584
Now you are an architect.

891
01:34:52,319 --> 01:34:55,084
I've registered my name in the
Architects Association of India.

892
01:34:55,322 --> 01:34:57,313
Soon <i>I'll</i> get a license.

893
01:34:58,092 --> 01:35:00,083
- Do you know my bunglow at Madh?
- Yes.

894
01:35:00,928 --> 01:35:03,090
Get a new design made there.

895
01:35:03,931 --> 01:35:08,266
- Yes. - Start your work
soon as uncle rejoins duty.

896
01:35:10,938 --> 01:35:12,929
- Do you know Rajhans?
- Yes.

897
01:35:13,607 --> 01:35:15,939
- He'll be at the bungalow.
- Sir.

898
01:35:16,343 --> 01:35:19,335
I've spoken to him about you.
He'll extend every help possible.

899
01:35:21,115 --> 01:35:23,345
Will you just say sir
or something else too?

900
01:35:24,118 --> 01:35:25,608
- Sir.
- Again?

901
01:35:25,720 --> 01:35:27,950
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

902
01:35:28,122 --> 01:35:31,114
- Why are you looking
at your watch? - Nothing.

903
01:35:31,459 --> 01:35:34,952
- Want to go some place?
- Yes.

904
01:35:36,363 --> 01:35:38,627
- Where?
- To the garage.

905
01:35:38,966 --> 01:35:42,129
- Why?
- To tune the car.

906
01:35:42,369 --> 01:35:44,360
It's just come from the garage.

907
01:35:44,638 --> 01:35:50,372
We leave the car there but
they work by their time.

908
01:35:50,644 --> 01:35:54,581
But I have to drive it so
I want to get it done myself.

909
01:35:56,417 --> 01:35:59,079
Try and get back soon. I have
to go out with Lawrence.

910
01:35:59,587 --> 01:36:03,319
I can't say how long
it will take there.

911
01:36:11,332 --> 01:36:12,925
- What are these?
- Income tax papers.

912
01:36:13,100 --> 01:36:15,330
Electricity, telephone.."

913
01:36:15,603 --> 01:36:18,095
Such a huge garage bill?

914
01:36:18,939 --> 01:36:21,101
We get just one garage bill.

915
01:36:21,342 --> 01:36:27,611
These guys have made so much cash
by repairing your cars that...

916
01:36:27,715 --> 01:36:28,944
They must have bought property.

917
01:36:29,116 --> 01:36:34,111
"If I had started a garage,
I'd own millions by now."

918
01:36:34,622 --> 01:36:38,354
Why don't you?
When will you resign as secretary?

919
01:36:38,626 --> 01:36:41,118
I won't quit that!

920
01:36:41,362 --> 01:36:43,956
- Why? Lots of cash in it?
- You embarrass me.

921
01:36:46,367 --> 01:36:49,359
- What are these?
- Hotel bills.

922
01:36:49,970 --> 01:36:52,564
- So much?
- Don't know sir...

923
01:36:53,307 --> 01:36:55,298
I was outdoor for 20 days last month.

924
01:36:56,076 --> 01:36:57,305
Did you...?

925
01:36:57,578 --> 01:37:01,572
I don't eat in hotels.
Only at the producer's cost.

926
01:37:03,417 --> 01:37:05,408
Somebody else is having
a ball at my expense.

927
01:37:11,926 --> 01:37:13,325
So much?

928
01:37:13,427 --> 01:37:18,092
Just take a bite from each
and <i>I'll</i> get my money's worth.

929
01:37:18,599 --> 01:37:23,594
- But this is wastage.
- That's my style.

930
01:37:24,271 --> 01:37:27,605
This means nothing to me.

931
01:37:28,342 --> 01:37:31,334
If you wish <i>I'll</i> buy you this hotel.

932
01:37:42,623 --> 01:37:47,356
Who has come in the grey Honda?
- A couple. They're in the restaurant

933
01:37:49,129 --> 01:37:51,564
Sit down. <i>I'll</i> get back.

934
01:37:55,069 --> 01:37:57,060
I'm on business terms with Jackie.

935
01:37:57,404 --> 01:38:00,567
I finance his cars and his business.

936
01:38:01,575 --> 01:38:04,169
That is how he has a new
imported car every month..

937
01:38:04,311 --> 01:38:06,302
You too have many good cars.

938
01:38:06,914 --> 01:38:08,905
- Thanks to him.
- Meaning?

939
01:38:09,583 --> 01:38:12,314
I stole my friend's hobby.

940
01:38:12,586 --> 01:38:14,577
Jackie is my friend.

941
01:38:15,422 --> 01:38:19,325
My relatives from Bangkok are here.

942
01:38:19,927 --> 01:38:23,591
"They're his fans, would love to
see him. Arrange something."

943
01:38:24,098 --> 01:38:26,089
That's no big deal.

944
01:38:26,333 --> 01:38:29,928
I have to snap my fingers
and Jackie will be there.

945
01:38:57,564 --> 01:39:01,057
Ingratiate! Wretch!
This is how you pay my debt!

946
01:39:01,302 --> 01:39:04,067
- But...
- What are you?

947
01:39:04,405 --> 01:39:07,397
You used my car to bring this
girl here to have a good time!

948
01:39:07,574 --> 01:39:09,565
- With my money!
- What?

949
01:39:09,910 --> 01:39:14,313
"The man who has no clothes,
uses my clothes to cover himself."

950
01:39:14,915 --> 01:39:18,579
Uses my credit card!
Such a man should be punished!

951
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:22,082
I respected you as the
son of a decent driver.

952
01:39:22,323 --> 01:39:26,590
And what did you do?
Tried to trap an innocent girl!

953
01:39:28,095 --> 01:39:30,587
- A driver's son?
- Yes.

954
01:39:30,931 --> 01:39:32,922
They live in the servant's
quarter behind my house.

955
01:39:36,603 --> 01:39:41,097
I respect his father so
I employed him as my driver.

956
01:39:41,608 --> 01:39:43,599
Liar! Cheat!

957
01:39:44,111 --> 01:39:46,603
You lied to me that you
are a multi-millionaire!

958
01:39:47,114 --> 01:39:49,105
You tried to buy me off!

959
01:39:51,051 --> 01:39:53,042
What's the matter?

960
01:39:54,288 --> 01:39:56,279
Nothing.

961
01:40:03,297 --> 01:40:05,288
No formality between friends.

962
01:40:07,568 --> 01:40:09,559
We have the same tastes.

963
01:40:12,906 --> 01:40:16,570
- You have along life.
- Whether life belong or short..

964
01:40:16,910 --> 01:40:18,901
You should live with pride.

965
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:23,311
Why are you breaking into sweat?
Maybe you ate something hot.

966
01:40:24,318 --> 01:40:26,309
How did you have spare time today?

967
01:40:26,420 --> 01:40:31,586
He found time for me
othenlvise he's always abroad.

968
01:40:31,925 --> 01:40:33,916
Indoor and outdoor.

969
01:40:34,328 --> 01:40:36,319
In this office or that.

970
01:40:36,597 --> 01:40:38,429
In this studio or that.

971
01:40:38,599 --> 01:40:40,590
That's why he hasn't
given me his phone number.

972
01:40:40,934 --> 01:40:42,925
Why didn't you use mine?

973
01:40:44,938 --> 01:40:46,929
I mean we are so similar.

974
01:40:47,341 --> 01:40:51,539
"Yes, that's why you
do business together."

975
01:40:51,879 --> 01:40:55,281
- He finances you.
- I owe all to him.

976
01:40:55,382 --> 01:40:57,373
Or I'd have been ruined.

977
01:40:58,552 --> 01:41:02,284
- You embarrass me.
- You've embarrassed me.

978
01:41:08,062 --> 01:41:10,053
What's your name?

979
01:41:12,900 --> 01:41:16,302
Would you like to marry him?

980
01:41:18,072 --> 01:41:22,066
No point in being afraid.
Tell me so I can talk to his family.

981
01:41:22,176 --> 01:41:24,577
- Yes or no?
- Yes.

982
01:41:28,082 --> 01:41:30,574
Call up when you have the time.
Anyway <i>I'll</i> be calling.

983
01:41:32,920 --> 01:41:34,911
Put their bill in my account.

984
01:41:36,090 --> 01:41:38,081
Anyway it would have
gone to my account.

985
01:41:45,599 --> 01:41:47,431
Don't you want to go to work?

986
01:41:47,601 --> 01:41:52,038
Get up. What's wrong?
Feeling all right?

987
01:41:53,273 --> 01:41:54,866
- Yes mother.
- Then get up.

988
01:41:55,042 --> 01:41:57,033
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

989
01:41:57,544 --> 01:42:01,879
- Get dressed fast.
- Sir will get late.

990
01:42:02,282 --> 01:42:05,547
- Get dressed soon.
- Yes father.

991
01:42:06,887 --> 01:42:10,551
Funny boy. Why laze around
when you have to go?

992
01:42:12,559 --> 01:42:14,550
- Where are you?
- Come in.

993
01:42:14,895 --> 01:42:17,057
- All fine?
- So far.

994
01:42:17,297 --> 01:42:20,062
"But if Deepak is late,
nothing will be fine."

995
01:42:20,901 --> 01:42:25,304
Hurry up. Sir has to
go to the golf club.

996
01:42:26,907 --> 01:42:29,399
"- Let's go sir.
- No, you look after the house."

997
01:42:29,576 --> 01:42:31,567
- But...
- Do as you're told.

998
01:43:20,360 --> 01:43:22,351
Do you know why I brought you here?

999
01:43:23,630 --> 01:43:25,621
To tell you the reality of life.

1000
01:43:27,367 --> 01:43:31,634
To teach you to earn your bread
the hard way not others' cash.

1001
01:43:33,373 --> 01:43:36,638
Get the ball.

1002
01:44:03,103 --> 01:44:09,099
You used my soft heartedness
for showing off false pride.

1003
01:44:10,611 --> 01:44:15,105
I am hurt that you
let my trust down.

1004
01:44:20,621 --> 01:44:22,612
Get the ball.

1005
01:45:00,427 --> 01:45:03,590
You behaved so badly despite
being an educated graduate.

1006
01:45:04,931 --> 01:45:08,595
You have fallen in my eyes.
Why did you do this?

1007
01:45:09,603 --> 01:45:11,594
- Because of you.
- Me?

1008
01:45:12,606 --> 01:45:19,103
"In the interview you said, this
was your style when you had no cash."

1009
01:45:20,113 --> 01:45:22,104
You spoke with confidence.

1010
01:45:22,349 --> 01:45:26,616
To everybody. The girls
of today only want style.

1011
01:45:27,354 --> 01:45:30,949
They don't care for money.
So I thought.

1012
01:45:31,358 --> 01:45:33,622
You would copy my style.
I can see the rest.

1013
01:45:34,361 --> 01:45:37,956
But have you heard of me
breaking somebody's heart?

1014
01:45:38,065 --> 01:45:40,966
Or that I lied?
Do you have any proof?

1015
01:45:42,369 --> 01:45:46,636
But you are hanging the picture
of your love on a shaky wall.

1016
01:45:47,641 --> 01:45:52,078
Remember never lie to the
person you love dearly.

1017
01:45:53,313 --> 01:45:55,304
- What do I do now?
- What's to be done?

1018
01:45:56,083 --> 01:45:58,074
Go and tell her the truth.

1019
01:45:58,585 --> 01:46:00,576
Tell her who you are
and what you do.

1020
01:46:01,588 --> 01:46:06,924
She will find out the truth someday.

1021
01:46:08,595 --> 01:46:11,087
Hiding the truth is cowardice.

1022
01:46:12,099 --> 01:46:14,090
And I don't consider
cowards my friends.

1023
01:46:26,947 --> 01:46:28,346
Take it.

1024
01:46:31,618 --> 01:46:34,610
Where are you?
- I want to meet you.

1025
01:46:35,222 --> 01:46:37,350
- Now?
- Yes. It's urgent.

1026
01:46:38,125 --> 01:46:43,120
Please come if you can.
<i>- I'll</i> have to come if you ask me to.

1027
01:46:43,964 --> 01:46:48,959
"Okay, outside Palm Grove hotel.
Bring your car."

1028
01:46:49,136 --> 01:46:51,070
- My car?
- What's wrong?

1029
01:46:51,905 --> 01:46:53,236
Nothing.

1030
01:46:54,574 --> 01:46:55,905
I don't have a car.

1031
01:47:18,932 --> 01:47:21,333
Car. . . Car!

1032
01:47:22,602 --> 01:47:24,593
Where can I get a car?

1033
01:47:25,105 --> 01:47:28,336
Something terrible is going to happen!

1034
01:47:30,444 --> 01:47:32,606
I fooled him for so many days.

1035
01:47:49,362 --> 01:47:53,560
- Jyoti here.
- How are you dear?

1036
01:47:54,067 --> 01:47:56,900
- You haven't come here for long.
- I will come.

1037
01:47:57,237 --> 01:48:00,298
Come soon. The house
seems lonely without you.

1038
01:48:01,908 --> 01:48:03,899
Yes. Is Gulu at home?

1039
01:48:04,177 --> 01:48:06,908
- Yes.
- Then call him.

1040
01:48:07,414 --> 01:48:09,405
- Sure.
- Who is it?

1041
01:48:10,317 --> 01:48:12,581
- Ask her if she'll eat a papad.
- Quiet!

1042
01:48:12,919 --> 01:48:16,082
- She wants to meet Gulu.
- Then <i>I'll</i> talk to her.

1043
01:48:16,323 --> 01:48:20,419
"- The match is fixed.
- Yes, but don't touch the phone."

1044
01:48:21,661 --> 01:48:24,596
I won't! Martial law is
imposed in this house!

1045
01:48:25,098 --> 01:48:28,329
I have no value here.
<i>I'll</i> go away to Hong Kong.

1046
01:48:28,435 --> 01:48:30,426
Who cares? You can go.

1047
01:48:34,341 --> 01:48:35,934
I have had it!

1048
01:48:36,109 --> 01:48:38,441
- What do I do?
- What's the matter?

1049
01:48:39,012 --> 01:48:43,108
- Nothing. Yes?
- I want to meet you.

1050
01:48:43,450 --> 01:48:45,942
Want to meet me? How? When?

1051
01:48:46,286 --> 01:48:49,950
- Get your car and come home.
- Good you specified the car.

1052
01:48:50,123 --> 01:48:52,057
Or I'd have come running.

1053
01:48:52,425 --> 01:48:55,292
- Get the car!
- Yes I will.

1054
01:49:06,573 --> 01:49:08,564
- Stop!
- Why?

1055
01:49:10,310 --> 01:49:13,905
Today I will neither go to buy
ice cream nor change my clothes.

1056
01:49:14,014 --> 01:49:16,312
<i>- I'll</i> just sit here.
- Don't go.

1057
01:49:16,583 --> 01:49:19,075
- At least fill fuel.
- What?

1058
01:49:19,319 --> 01:49:22,914
- There's enough.
- Fill the tank.

1059
01:49:23,089 --> 01:49:26,081
Why?
- We're going on along drive.

1060
01:49:26,593 --> 01:49:28,584
If we run out of petrol...?

1061
01:49:29,329 --> 01:49:33,926
Long drive? Running out
of fuel will be a problem.

1062
01:49:34,100 --> 01:49:36,091
That is why I told you.

1063
01:49:57,223 --> 01:50:01,285
You'rejust like my mummy.
- What? I'm your mummy!

1064
01:50:01,895 --> 01:50:06,059
I mean she orders my
Daddyjust like you did.

1065
01:50:06,566 --> 01:50:09,558
I love it when you
order me around.

1066
01:50:10,303 --> 01:50:13,568
"Okay, give me your purse
and go call my mummy."

1067
01:50:14,908 --> 01:50:16,569
Why call mummy?

1068
01:50:17,310 --> 01:50:22,578
We're going on along drive.
She'll worry if we're late.

1069
01:50:38,932 --> 01:50:40,923
Give me the keys.

1070
01:50:52,879 --> 01:50:56,042
- Where's the car?
- Madam took it.

1071
01:50:56,282 --> 01:51:02,051
- She didn't even pay for the fuel.
- What!

1072
01:51:05,158 --> 01:51:07,286
Long drive? How do you know?

1073
01:51:08,895 --> 01:51:12,058
She called up and told me
we'll go on a long drive.

1074
01:51:12,565 --> 01:51:14,556
What is long drive?

1075
01:51:15,902 --> 01:51:20,567
He doesn't know what it means!
Long drive is along road.

1076
01:51:20,907 --> 01:51:26,402
This long road must be
ending at her friend's house.

1077
01:51:26,579 --> 01:51:28,570
No, she is not at any friend's place."

1078
01:51:29,315 --> 01:51:32,250
- How do you know?
- I called them up.

1079
01:51:32,352 --> 01:51:33,911
She is not there.

1080
01:51:34,087 --> 01:51:39,321
Sometimes I feel she is
involved in something.

1081
01:51:41,327 --> 01:51:43,921
- Maybe a boy friend..
- Shut up!

1082
01:51:44,330 --> 01:51:47,322
Aren't you ashamed to
use such language for her?

1083
01:51:47,434 --> 01:51:50,096
I am ashamed that is why
I did not go to my Daddy.

1084
01:51:50,336 --> 01:51:52,031
Came to tell you right away.

1085
01:51:52,272 --> 01:51:57,540
- You mustn't tell your Dad.
- I won't if you wish.

1086
01:51:58,044 --> 01:52:02,038
- But sometimes a boy...
- Stop it now!

1087
01:52:02,615 --> 01:52:07,280
It's best if you leave now.
- How? My car is with Jyoti.

1088
01:52:17,897 --> 01:52:21,060
Go and sit in the car.

1089
01:52:21,568 --> 01:52:25,061
- You too are getting wet.
- You'll fall sick.

1090
01:52:25,572 --> 01:52:27,301
So could you.

1091
01:52:27,574 --> 01:52:30,407
The car won't be fixed
if you get wet

1092
01:52:31,077 --> 01:52:33,068
Go in and sit.

1093
01:52:34,314 --> 01:52:38,308
- Why are you staring at me?
- You look cute when you scold me.

1094
01:52:39,085 --> 01:52:43,318
- Go and sit.
- Is this an order or a request?

1095
01:52:43,923 --> 01:52:48,087
- Order.
- Then <i>I'll</i> have to go.

1096
01:52:48,928 --> 01:52:52,091
And my order is that
you repair the car soon.

1097
01:52:52,332 --> 01:52:54,323
Now go on!

1098
01:53:31,971 --> 01:53:36,135
It's fun being in your arms

1099
01:53:37,977 --> 01:53:43,973
"Intoxication takes
over my eyes"""

1100
01:53:46,319 --> 01:53:52,315
"You are my desire,
you are my life..."""

1101
01:53:52,425 --> 01:53:59,422
"My love...
Listen to what my heart says"""

1102
01:54:03,102 --> 01:54:09,098
It's fun being in your arms

1103
01:54:11,010 --> 01:54:17,108
"The intoxication is
going to my eyes"""

1104
01:54:19,352 --> 01:54:25,348
"You are my desire,
you are my life..."""

1105
01:54:25,458 --> 01:54:32,364
"My love...
Listen to what my heart says"""

1106
01:55:18,511 --> 01:55:21,947
"It's here sometimes,
there sometimes..."""

1107
01:55:22,115 --> 01:55:25,608
I can't tell you where it hurts

1108
01:55:38,131 --> 01:55:45,128
"These fires, this pining...
they won't be put out"""

1109
01:55:46,139 --> 01:55:52,078
"Come closer, it'll
give me some peace"""

1110
01:57:20,500 --> 01:57:27,600
"Young and beautiful are these times...
I don't know how thirst I feel"""

1111
01:57:40,286 --> 01:57:47,124
"What pining, my restlessness is
this... it sets my body on fire"""

1112
01:57:48,127 --> 01:57:54,066
"How much will love
make us pine?"""

1113
01:59:22,321 --> 01:59:24,312
Where had you gone?

1114
01:59:25,424 --> 01:59:28,086
Why don't you answer?
Where were you?

1115
01:59:28,261 --> 01:59:30,593
- Where had you gone?
- What are you doing?

1116
01:59:30,997 --> 01:59:34,331
<i>I'll</i> kill her! Has she any shame?

1117
01:59:34,600 --> 01:59:37,092
Does any decent girl
stay out all night?

1118
01:59:37,603 --> 01:59:40,937
"If anyone finds out,
how will I face the world?"

1119
01:59:43,109 --> 01:59:45,100
Does she think <i>I'll</i> spare her?

1120
01:59:45,344 --> 01:59:47,335
I'll kill her!

1121
01:59:50,116 --> 01:59:53,279
- Don't interfere!
- No point screaming.

1122
01:59:54,387 --> 01:59:59,291
The child has just returned.
Calmly ask her where she was.

1123
01:59:59,392 --> 02:00:05,559
How can I be calm?
Do young girls behave so?

1124
02:00:05,898 --> 02:00:07,889
Decent girls behave?

1125
02:00:08,901 --> 02:00:12,303
I've slogged all life.

1126
02:00:13,072 --> 02:00:15,564
I've met people's eyes.

1127
02:00:15,908 --> 02:00:18,900
- And you ruined my image!
- What are you doing?

1128
02:00:19,078 --> 02:00:23,572
Stop it. Nobody will malign you.

1129
02:00:24,650 --> 02:00:28,587
Stand here quietly. <i>I'll</i> ask her.

1130
02:00:32,925 --> 02:00:35,917
What happened child?

1131
02:00:37,930 --> 02:00:43,926
- The car stalled.
- Why did you take his car?

1132
02:00:44,103 --> 02:00:47,095
If you want to show off, marry him."

1133
02:00:47,206 --> 02:00:50,335
Then go in his car.
I won't be burdened!

1134
02:00:50,443 --> 02:00:56,280
- If the girl says...
- Couldn't she have called?

1135
02:00:56,549 --> 02:00:59,541
- She must have forgotten in fear
- Stop it.

1136
02:01:00,553 --> 02:01:04,888
I've seen the result of giving
her freedom. Thought she'd reform.

1137
02:01:05,057 --> 02:01:06,889
But she's dancing on my head!

1138
02:01:07,059 --> 02:01:12,054
Get up! Don't you dare
step out of the house!

1139
02:01:12,398 --> 02:01:16,562
"If you allow her to go out,
<i>I'll</i> even

1140
02:01:25,077 --> 02:01:27,068
Welcome, my prince."

1141
02:01:27,313 --> 02:01:29,577
- Where were you lost?
- Now stop it.

1142
02:01:30,149 --> 02:01:32,140
Why should I?

1143
02:01:32,318 --> 02:01:36,915
This is no hotel that you can
stay in and leave as you feel.

1144
02:01:37,089 --> 02:01:40,081
I have some rights. I'm your
father not a hotel owner!

1145
02:01:40,326 --> 02:01:46,095
- What are you saying?
- He should know his limitations.

1146
02:01:46,599 --> 02:01:49,091
Nobody becomes great
by getting big degrees!

1147
02:01:49,335 --> 02:01:52,270
He should have manners.
Know how to live decently.

1148
02:01:52,371 --> 02:01:56,035
- Forget it. - How can I?
I've been worried about him!

1149
02:01:56,609 --> 02:01:58,873
Lamps of love burn in
the hearts of the poor.

1150
02:01:59,378 --> 02:02:01,369
We live and breath in its' light.

1151
02:02:01,547 --> 02:02:03,538
That is why nobody slept
all night. Take a look!

1152
02:02:04,550 --> 02:02:09,886
We are waiting for him and it
won't do if he spreads darkness.

1153
02:02:11,290 --> 02:02:14,055
He was enjoying with his friends!

1154
02:02:14,293 --> 02:02:17,058
Look outside!
Such a great man!

1155
02:02:17,563 --> 02:02:23,400
He loves us so much. All night
his light was lit. He didn't sleep.

1156
02:02:24,303 --> 02:02:27,068
He too has sympathy for us.
And you...!

1157
02:02:27,306 --> 02:02:29,297
Why don't you answer? Where were you?

1158
02:02:30,076 --> 02:02:32,408
- What are you doing?
- Why don't you ask him?

1159
02:02:33,079 --> 02:02:36,913
- Where were you all night?
- The car broke down.

1160
02:02:37,316 --> 02:02:40,081
He had gone with friends.
And the car broke down.

1161
02:02:42,088 --> 02:02:44,580
Go and rest for awhile.

1162
02:02:48,094 --> 02:02:50,927
Is this the way to
talk to your young son?

1163
02:02:51,030 --> 02:02:54,933
What do I do?
I was upset all night.

1164
02:02:55,101 --> 02:02:58,935
You know how bad times are.
What if something happened to him?

1165
02:02:59,105 --> 02:03:02,939
Nothing will happen to our son.
God is with us.

1166
02:03:05,945 --> 02:03:07,936
Why are you crying?

1167
02:03:09,115 --> 02:03:11,345
Tears just sprung up.

1168
02:03:11,617 --> 02:03:13,949
Been controlling them for long.

1169
02:03:14,353 --> 02:03:18,119
I know but what can we do?

1170
02:03:18,457 --> 02:03:20,448
He will learn when
he has his own children.

1171
02:03:20,626 --> 02:03:23,618
He is very sensible.
That is why he is quiet.

1172
02:03:23,963 --> 02:03:27,365
He realises his error.
Now he won't repeat it.

1173
02:04:17,116 --> 02:04:22,953
"Even if I express my grouse

You are the one I love

You are the one I love

1187
02:07:30,109 --> 02:07:35,104
I can keep my promises too

1188
02:07:35,948 --> 02:07:40,943
For you, <i>I'll</i> forsake the world"

You are the one I really love

02:09:07,506 --> 02:09:12,068
You are the one I love

1199
02:09:27,426 --> 02:09:31,329
What can I tell you sir?
Deepak is very quiet these days.

1200
02:09:31,930 --> 02:09:34,592
He neither eats nor sleeps.

1201
02:09:36,602 --> 02:09:39,094
Didn't you ask him what's wrong?

1202
02:09:39,338 --> 02:09:42,603
I did but he doesn't answer.

1203
02:09:43,342 --> 02:09:45,106
I don't understand what's wrong.

1204
02:09:45,344 --> 02:09:48,109
One can't be firm with a youngster.

1205
02:09:48,947 --> 02:09:50,938
We have to act our age.

1206
02:09:52,050 --> 02:09:56,886
He's closer to your age.
And quite informal with you.

1207
02:09:57,389 --> 02:10:00,552
Talk to him once.
He may open up to you.

1208
02:10:01,894 --> 02:10:04,295
All right. Send him in the morning.

1209
02:10:05,297 --> 02:10:07,288
<i>Iwill sir.</i>

1210
02:10:13,572 --> 02:10:15,904
Is what you're doing right?

1211
02:10:16,575 --> 02:10:18,907
- But sir...
- No buts!

1212
02:10:19,077 --> 02:10:21,910
Do you know what your parents
undergo due to your silence?

1213
02:10:22,581 --> 02:10:26,074
Your joys are their life.
And your silence their death.

1214
02:10:27,085 --> 02:10:32,319
- I know. -You know it so being
morose won't solve the problem.

1215
02:10:32,925 --> 02:10:38,329
"I've already told you to tell the
girl the truth, what's in your heart."

1216
02:10:38,597 --> 02:10:41,089
"If she really loves you,
she will accept you anyway."

1217
02:10:41,600 --> 02:10:44,592
I can't confront her.

1218
02:10:44,937 --> 02:10:49,932
I'm ashamed of you!
Your Dad gave me 15 years!

1219
02:10:50,609 --> 02:10:53,044
I can't bear to see him
helpless and worried.

1220
02:10:53,545 --> 02:10:56,276
"If you don't have the guts,
<i>I'll</i> call up and tell her."

1221
02:10:56,548 --> 02:10:59,279
<i>I'll</i> tell her myself.

1222
02:11:15,067 --> 02:11:21,905
Lord! Give me the strength to
tell Jyoti the complete truth.

1223
02:11:23,909 --> 02:11:26,310
Give me the strength.

1224
02:11:46,932 --> 02:11:50,926
I've called you here because
I want to talk to you frankly.

1225
02:11:52,271 --> 02:11:54,535
I too was dying to meet you.

1226
02:11:55,274 --> 02:11:59,541
I too have a lot to tell you.

1227
02:12:00,279 --> 02:12:07,276
If I am not wealthy...?

1228
02:12:07,886 --> 02:12:15,885
And if I'm not wealthy...?

1229
02:12:17,296 --> 02:12:25,296
I'm a driver's son.

1230
02:12:30,909 --> 02:12:34,311
I'm a dress designer's daughter.

1231
02:12:35,314 --> 02:12:42,084
All those imported cars
belong to Jackie sir.

1232
02:12:43,088 --> 02:12:46,922
My car too is Gulu's not mine.

1233
02:12:48,093 --> 02:12:51,085
All my clothes are actually his.

1234
02:12:51,930 --> 02:12:54,092
I too wore clothes of heroines.

1235
02:12:56,601 --> 02:12:58,592
I lied to you.

1236
02:13:00,605 --> 02:13:02,596
Even I never spoke the truth.

1237
02:13:59,598 --> 02:14:03,592
I gave up the earth
in order to fly high.

1238
02:14:05,604 --> 02:14:08,596
One lie gave birth to many sins.

1239
02:14:10,342 --> 02:14:14,336
I became incomplete with every lie.

1240
02:14:15,614 --> 02:14:21,951
I had no courage to meet anyone's
eyes as I had given up the truth.

1241
02:14:23,622 --> 02:14:26,114
I lost my identity in
this world of lies.

1242
02:14:27,626 --> 02:14:31,620
But today I feel much lighter.

1243
02:14:34,366 --> 02:14:38,633
Yes, I feel a new strength in me."

1244
02:14:40,972 --> 02:14:45,136
This is the truth.
I'm an architect

1245
02:14:47,646 --> 02:14:49,637
I am unemployed as of now.

1246
02:14:50,382 --> 02:14:56,321
"But in the days to come, I can
provide you with shelter and bread."

1247
02:14:57,589 --> 02:15:00,081
Really? That's what I want.

1248
02:15:01,426 --> 02:15:04,589
I hope you won't leave me again?

1249
02:15:07,332 --> 02:15:09,926
Only death can drive us apart.

1250
02:15:10,936 --> 02:15:13,598
- Honest?
- Yes.

1251
02:15:40,465 --> 02:15:43,366
The first time I saw you...

1252
02:15:44,369 --> 02:15:47,634
I lost my heart to you

1253
02:16:00,585 --> 02:16:03,316
I told you so many lies...

1254
02:16:04,322 --> 02:16:07,587
"because I wanted to be able
to have you"""

1255
02:16:08,326 --> 02:16:12,320
"In your arms now,
I must live and die..."""

1256
02:16:12,430 --> 02:16:17,095
"every happiness of mine
flows from you, my love"""

1257
02:16:20,338 --> 02:16:24,332
"You are just the girl
I always wanted..."""

1258
02:16:24,609 --> 02:16:29,103
will you be friends with me?

1259
02:16:54,573 --> 02:16:57,304
I'm a poor man...

1260
02:16:58,577 --> 02:17:01,911
I don't live in palaces

1261
02:17:14,926 --> 02:17:17,588
It was only a joke...

1262
02:17:19,097 --> 02:17:22,089
but I'm not lying now

1263
02:17:23,101 --> 02:17:31,101
"I have no bungalows, nor cars...
but I have no dearth of love"""

1264
02:17:34,946 --> 02:17:38,940
"You are just the man
I always wanted"""

1265
02:17:39,117 --> 02:17:43,611
Will you be friends with me?

1266
02:17:47,292 --> 02:17:50,956
"You're just the girl
I always wanted"""

1267
02:17:51,062 --> 02:17:55,556
Will you be my love?

1268
02:18:07,579 --> 02:18:10,913
- Let go!
- My dog barking at me?

1269
02:18:11,082 --> 02:18:13,073
What were you doing with him?

1270
02:18:58,897 --> 02:19:01,298
Don't beat him! I beg you.

1271
02:19:01,399 --> 02:19:04,300
That you must do after
we're married. Beat him up!

1272
02:19:15,313 --> 02:19:17,577
Throw him near his hut.

1273
02:19:21,086 --> 02:19:24,920
Thank God I reached in time
or they would have eloped.

1274
02:19:25,323 --> 02:19:28,918
The whole world would
spit on you thanks to her.

1275
02:19:29,094 --> 02:19:31,324
"- He is lying!
- Shut up, shameless woman!"

1276
02:19:31,596 --> 02:19:34,088
You dare to argue after all this!

1277
02:19:34,332 --> 02:19:37,927
You wanted to marry a rich man.

1278
02:19:38,103 --> 02:19:40,333
Is this your wealthy man?
The son of a driver?

1279
02:19:40,605 --> 02:19:43,336
Whatever he is, I love him!"

1280
02:19:43,942 --> 02:19:46,343
I give two hoots to your love!

1281
02:19:46,611 --> 02:19:50,445
You'll do as I wish.
Bring your parents tomorrow.

1282
02:19:50,949 --> 02:19:52,883
I want to get you married right away.

1283
02:19:53,051 --> 02:19:57,045
I'll return with the procession.

1284
02:20:09,567 --> 02:20:13,060
Hurry up child.
The devil may land up.

1285
02:20:13,571 --> 02:20:17,906
- Almost done.
- Call me on reaching.

1286
02:20:18,576 --> 02:20:20,567
Also tell me about
Deepak's well being.

1287
02:20:24,082 --> 02:20:27,916
Be happy. May God bless you.

1288
02:20:30,588 --> 02:20:34,582
This is what I feared.

1289
02:20:34,926 --> 02:20:36,917
What do we do?

1290
02:20:40,598 --> 02:20:43,090
Take this.

1291
02:20:43,435 --> 02:20:47,269
- What do I do with these?
- Hold them.

1292
02:20:47,605 --> 02:20:50,097
And walk out. Fast.

1293
02:20:50,608 --> 02:20:52,042
Go to R.K.Studios.

1294
02:20:52,277 --> 02:20:55,042
Fix everything mummy.

1295
02:20:57,549 --> 02:21:01,543
She's feeling shy listening
to our marriage talk.

1296
02:21:01,886 --> 02:21:03,877
You'll get the rest of
the clothes by evening.

1297
02:21:04,889 --> 02:21:07,051
- Errand boy.
- Is it a man or Jyoti?

1298
02:21:07,392 --> 02:21:10,885
Don't you know the difference
between a man and a woman?

1299
02:21:11,062 --> 02:21:14,555
He can only see Jyoti all around.

1300
02:21:14,899 --> 02:21:21,896
Good we are hurrying up or
he would cling to every girl.

1301
02:21:22,907 --> 02:21:24,568
Quiet. No jokes.

1302
02:21:24,676 --> 02:21:28,078
- You'll soon be a father-in-law.
- And you a mother-in-law.

1303
02:21:28,313 --> 02:21:30,304
But is laughing not allowed?

1304
02:21:30,915 --> 02:21:33,407
- Quiet! Come in.
- As you order.

1305
02:21:36,588 --> 02:21:38,920
Must be dressing the girl.

1306
02:21:40,592 --> 02:21:43,425
Good material. Must
supply to Hong Kong.

1307
02:21:43,928 --> 02:21:46,329
Sort out marriage expenses.

1308
02:21:47,332 --> 02:21:51,860
- Sit down.
- How are you?

1309
02:21:55,874 --> 02:21:58,536
You've surpassed Hong Kong.

1310
02:21:58,877 --> 02:22:02,370
Quick marriage, quick baby.."

1311
02:22:02,547 --> 02:22:06,541
- What speed..
- No jokes!

1312
02:22:08,286 --> 02:22:11,381
- I want the marriage soon...
- No need for explanations.

1313
02:22:11,556 --> 02:22:16,551
Gulu told us everything. Give us
our bride. <i>I'll</i> do the needful.

1314
02:22:17,061 --> 02:22:19,052
- Where is she?
- In the <i>room.</i>

1315
02:22:21,299 --> 02:22:25,566
- Why is she locked in?
- The golden goose is always locked.

1316
02:22:26,070 --> 02:22:28,061
Othenlvise she flies away.

1317
02:22:33,411 --> 02:22:35,402
Where is she?

1318
02:22:36,314 --> 02:22:38,305
- Isn't she here?
- No.

1319
02:22:44,088 --> 02:22:48,082
- Where is she?
- Where she should be.

1320
02:22:55,433 --> 02:22:57,094
Whom do you want?

1321
02:22:58,603 --> 02:23:01,937
- Are you Deepak's friend?
- Yes.

1322
02:23:02,106 --> 02:23:04,939
Do you know some hoods
beat him up yesterday?

1323
02:23:05,610 --> 02:23:07,942
He is quite hurt. See.

1324
02:23:11,616 --> 02:23:13,607
What has happened?

1325
02:23:19,624 --> 02:23:24,118
- This is Jyoti.
- So you are Jyoti.

1326
02:23:25,630 --> 02:23:27,962
Why have you come here? Go away!

1327
02:23:28,132 --> 02:23:30,965
See how your men beat up my child!

1328
02:23:31,369 --> 02:23:33,963
Yes, we don't want your wealth!"

1329
02:23:34,238 --> 02:23:36,366
We are happy with our dry bread.

1330
02:23:36,641 --> 02:23:40,976
We maybe poor but our
respect means a lot to us.

1331
02:23:41,145 --> 02:23:45,981
- She is like us.
- Meaning?

1332
02:23:46,384 --> 02:23:49,376
She is poor. Gulu beat me up.

1333
02:23:51,122 --> 02:23:55,320
- Who is he?
- He wants to marry her.

1334
02:23:56,594 --> 02:24:00,087
I've given up everything
and come to you.

1335
02:24:01,099 --> 02:24:04,592
I've also been beaten up.

1336
02:24:08,940 --> 02:24:10,931
Very cruel.

1337
02:24:11,109 --> 02:24:14,101
I can't live without him.

1338
02:24:15,346 --> 02:24:20,113
"If you turn me away,
where will I go?"

1339
02:24:20,351 --> 02:24:24,117
Even I can't live without her.

1340
02:24:25,623 --> 02:24:28,354
- Did you hear?
- Yes.

1341
02:24:30,962 --> 02:24:33,624
Have you told your family?

1342
02:24:34,132 --> 02:24:37,124
What are you saying?
Can't you see they've beaten her?

1343
02:24:37,235 --> 02:24:39,966
She's disguised like a boy.
Would she have informed them?

1344
02:24:40,138 --> 02:24:43,369
That's what I want to hear.
- What do we do now?

1345
02:24:44,976 --> 02:24:48,378
Take her to sir's Madh island house.

1346
02:24:48,980 --> 02:24:51,574
Sir will find a solution.

1347
02:24:52,583 --> 02:24:54,574
Hurry up. Don't waste time.

1348
02:24:54,919 --> 02:24:56,910
- Be careful.
- Live long.

1349
02:25:06,330 --> 02:25:08,924
You go with Munna to bring her.

1350
02:25:16,107 --> 02:25:18,098
- Where is Jyoti?
- Are you related to her?

1351
02:25:18,342 --> 02:25:20,606
- She is my daughter.
- Our daughter-in-law.

1352
02:25:21,112 --> 02:25:25,447
"Your daughter-in-law without
any ceremony, band, rituals?"

1353
02:25:25,950 --> 02:25:27,941
Quickly tell us where she is!

1354
02:25:28,052 --> 02:25:30,043
Othenlvise you'll regret it!

1355
02:25:31,456 --> 02:25:34,357
- Leave him alone.
- This will happen!

1356
02:25:36,461 --> 02:25:39,624
Don't beat him. <i>I'll</i> tell you.

1357
02:25:39,964 --> 02:25:42,456
Jyoti has gone to sir's
Madh house with Deepak.

1358
02:25:42,633 --> 02:25:45,364
- Who is sir?
- Sir...

1359
02:25:47,371 --> 02:25:49,362
- Come on!
- No!

1360
02:25:52,910 --> 02:25:55,072
He'll show us the way
to Jackie's house.

1361
02:26:17,935 --> 02:26:20,336
- Sir!
- Uncle?

1362
02:26:20,938 --> 02:26:23,930
- Quiet!
- Now you'll see how he beats!

1363
02:26:24,609 --> 02:26:29,103
Are we clothes?
And is he a washerman?

1364
02:26:50,134 --> 02:26:51,568
He is following us.

1365
02:27:04,582 --> 02:27:07,313
He is chasing us!

1366
02:27:11,422 --> 02:27:13,584
Let's do one thing.

1367
02:27:14,592 --> 02:27:17,084
Become the villain of his path.

1368
02:27:17,595 --> 02:27:20,087
Stop him.

1369
02:28:20,091 --> 02:28:22,924
Now you can relax.

1370
02:28:23,594 --> 02:28:27,326
How can I relax?
Gulu can land anytime.

1371
02:28:27,598 --> 02:28:30,329
They will come only when
they know we are here.

1372
02:28:31,335 --> 02:28:33,326
Yet I am afraid.

1373
02:28:34,338 --> 02:28:37,603
I thought you were very brave.

1374
02:28:38,109 --> 02:28:42,945
- But you're a coward.
- It's not that.

1375
02:28:44,615 --> 02:28:47,346
"For the first time,
I've opposed my mummy."

1376
02:28:48,953 --> 02:28:51,047
I don't know what she's feeling.

1377
02:28:51,555 --> 02:28:53,546
She'll never forgive me.

1378
02:28:55,293 --> 02:28:59,287
She will forgive you.
When we go to her after marriage...

1379
02:29:00,064 --> 02:29:02,055
She will have to bless us.

1380
02:29:20,318 --> 02:29:22,309
How did you land here?

1381
02:29:22,586 --> 02:29:24,577
There's no difference
between me and lightning.

1382
02:29:24,922 --> 02:29:27,323
You see it up there
but it strikes down here.

1383
02:29:32,596 --> 02:29:34,928
Hero! Don't act smart.

1384
02:29:36,934 --> 02:29:39,926
I've just become a hero.
But I've always been smart.

1385
02:29:46,110 --> 02:29:48,101
Nab the long haired man.

1386
02:30:09,300 --> 02:30:11,564
He fights in films and real life too!

1387
02:30:39,930 --> 02:30:41,921
I say, come on."

1388
02:30:42,266 --> 02:30:45,327
Jyoti is mine.
Kill him.

1389
02:30:46,937 --> 02:30:49,599
You are mine. We are
going to get married.

1390
02:30:49,707 --> 02:30:52,039
They will kill the
long haired man!

1391
02:31:03,554 --> 02:31:04,885
Long haired man!

1392
02:32:05,049 --> 02:32:07,279
Jackie beats me.
Then the long haired guy hits!

1393
02:32:44,088 --> 02:32:46,580
These are the hoods.
- Don't let them escape.

1394
02:32:49,593 --> 02:32:51,925
Jackie really beats...

1395
02:32:52,930 --> 02:32:58,334
But the police... Run.
But Jyoti belongs to me.

1396
02:32:59,937 --> 02:33:01,928
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

1397
02:33:03,941 --> 02:33:05,431
Are you hurt?

1398
02:33:05,543 --> 02:33:10,105
After years got a chance to fight
He spoilt it by calling the police.

1399
02:33:10,347 --> 02:33:12,338
Or I'd made mince meat by now.

1400
02:33:13,350 --> 02:33:15,614
- Who is that woman?
- Jyoti's mother.

1401
02:33:19,356 --> 02:33:21,620
You're getting your daughter
married to such a fool.

1402
02:33:22,960 --> 02:33:26,624
He needs hoods to possess her.
He can't look after her all life.

1403
02:33:27,464 --> 02:33:30,365
"And if the fool has the guts,
let him fight Deepak."

1404
02:33:30,968 --> 02:33:33,630
"What does he lack?
He's educated, handsome."

1405
02:33:33,971 --> 02:33:36,372
He'll get ajob soon.
He'll be a great architect.

1406
02:33:36,974 --> 02:33:40,638
"And if she desires him,
who can stop her?"

1407
02:33:41,645 --> 02:33:44,137
"Yet if you want to
take her away, please do."

1408
02:33:44,648 --> 02:33:48,983
- I won't go.
- Go Jyoti.

1409
02:33:49,153 --> 02:33:51,087
How long do you want to keep her?

1410
02:33:51,322 --> 02:33:53,313
I don't want to.

1411
02:33:54,091 --> 02:33:58,085
"Once the daughter steps out,
she is a stranger to us."

1412
02:33:58,929 --> 02:34:02,593
"And if you're in a hurry,
quickly get the bridal procession."

1413
02:34:04,335 --> 02:34:06,326
I don't like waiting.

1414
02:34:09,340 --> 02:34:11,331
- Is it fine uncle?
- Yes sir.

1415
02:34:11,609 --> 02:34:14,943
Then bless them.

1416
02:34:15,946 --> 02:34:17,937
Live long children.

1417
02:34:19,617 --> 02:34:23,611
For my 6 month old kid, not me."

1418
02:34:23,954 --> 02:34:25,945
He's a great fan of yours.

1419
02:34:27,958 --> 02:34:30,450
- He sees all your films.
- Really? Six month
