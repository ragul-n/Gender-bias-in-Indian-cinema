00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:36,353
Your food, sir.

174
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:42,275
Maggie, I ordered this for you.
Especially, for your eyes

175
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:46,237
Your eyes are perfect.
Eat what I ordered for you

176
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:49,908
It's good for your heart and mind.
- You need brains, you eat

177
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:52,035
I have brains.
- So why don't you bring it?

178
00:15:52,077 --> 00:15:54,120
Shut up!
- Cool

179
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,831
don't fight. I'll
eat both. Let's eat...

180
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:59,334
I'm very hungry.
- OKay, darling

181
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:02,462
do it fast. Don't waste
your time on one table

182
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:08,718
Eat this, good for
you thighs... eyes

00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:14,474
I said, I'll pay.

00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:17,268
I pay!
- Not fair. It's my party

185
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:20,355
I'll pay for myself and Maggie.
- It's not tip, it's a bill

186
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:22,565
You carry on... eat my share too.

187
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:26,736
This dinner's on me. Nobody pays.

188
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:31,658
Forget it, Sam. Next time.
Let him pay this time

189
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:35,161
If you say so. But I
don't taKe favours

190
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:38,998
come on Sam, don't
fight now. Cool down

191
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,375
Let me have something.

192
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:47,674
Where's my wallet?

193
00:16:57,142 --> 00:16:58,810
Where are you looKing?

194
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:04,357
Stupid!

195
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:13,408
Shut up, you...

196
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:22,292
come with me

197
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:27,172
The stupid is disturbing. Where

198
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:30,467
Friend...

199
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:34,804
I'm sorry, I broKe your heart

200
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,641
I shouldn't be doing this.
Foot the bill, please

201
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:41,895
There you are! Now you
Know that Maggie is with me

206
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:53,323
Are you going to eat those cherries?

207
00:17:57,786 --> 00:18:00,914
No. Do you want it?
- I liKe cherries very much.

208
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:05,126
You mind it, don't you?

215
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:41,121
They left. They said, you will pay.

216
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:54,843
Greetings, sir.
- Yes, son? Can I help you?

217
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:58,847
Perhaps you have no idea,
I'm a great fan of yours

218
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:04,144
I want a photograph from you that
has never been published or seen

219
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:10,316
And... the negative too.
It's for my personal collection

220
00:19:10,734 --> 00:19:13,445
I'm willing to pay any price, sir

221
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:17,615

Fine?

00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:39,554
Your father fixed your wedding,
with the consent of the two of you

225
00:19:39,763 --> 00:19:44,976
But ever since you were engaged,
I've only seen you brawling

226
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:50,398
Your fathers were childhood
Friends, they were thicK friends

227
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:54,569
They came here and together
they joined the Indian Embassy

228
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:59,741
Give him water. They retired
together and went bacK to India

229
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:03,828
don't fight and
breaK their friendship

230
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:06,915
If you don't want to marry,
decide it right now

231
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:09,250
I never said I don't want to marry

232
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:16,091

I'll send the two of you to India

239
00:20:44,619 --> 00:20:46,329

what crap! How can he get an award?

255
00:21:57,525 --> 00:22:00,653
Sir, you Know that he's a
bad shot, but you guys...

256
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:04,616
He holds a camera liKe
he's holding a coconut

257
00:22:04,908 --> 00:22:08,870
I Know you guys well. The two
of you hardly Know photography

258
00:22:09,162 --> 00:22:12,999
But he gets an award!
- Sir, he's a fraud! A cheat

259
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:16,336
He steals
photographs for competitions

260
00:22:16,461 --> 00:22:19,589
I Know where he stole
those photographs from

261
00:22:19,756 --> 00:22:23,635
But he's made our
magazine Garam Masala famous

262
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:26,554
Sir, I will fight. I
will not leave this

263
00:22:26,721 --> 00:22:28,723
This war has to be...
- Shut up!

264
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:31,017
Silence, idiot

265
00:22:31,101 --> 00:22:34,020
This hunger has
heated up your brains

266
00:22:34,229 --> 00:22:38,191
Attend tonight's party and stuff
yourself. It will cool your brains

267
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:41,152
But I will fight

268
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:43,238
Out you go!

269
00:22:45,073 --> 00:22:46,366
I will fight.

270
00:23:06,553 --> 00:23:09,347
He stole my heart on the sly

271
00:23:09,431 --> 00:23:11,850
Lord, he tooK my heart away

272
00:23:11,975 --> 00:23:15,687
He made me belong to him,
showed me beautiful dreams...

273
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:17,230
...and tooK my heart away

274
00:23:17,856 --> 00:23:19,941
On the sly...

275
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:22,402
...he stole my heart

276
00:23:23,278 --> 00:23:27,490
On the sly... he stole my heart

277
00:23:59,022 --> 00:24:02,859
My love, you are handsome

278
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:05,695
You fascinate me

279
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:07,947
You are mine

280
00:24:10,241 --> 00:24:13,203
My love, you are handsome

281
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:15,789
You fascinate me

282
00:24:16,414 --> 00:24:18,500
You are mine

283
00:24:20,669 --> 00:24:23,463
You have set my heart racing

284
00:24:23,546 --> 00:24:25,965
You have robbed me of my peace

285
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:30,929
At the very first sight,
my heart writhed in agony

286
00:24:31,054 --> 00:24:34,182
On the sly...

287
00:24:34,224 --> 00:24:36,309
you stole my heart

288
00:24:36,518 --> 00:24:39,104
On the sly...

289
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:41,731
you stole my heart

290
00:25:12,929 --> 00:25:16,975
My love, the
fragrance of your breath...

291
00:25:17,017 --> 00:25:19,185
and the magic in your words...

292
00:25:19,811 --> 00:25:22,063
maKe me lose my composure

293
00:25:23,523 --> 00:25:27,110
My love, the
fragrance of your breath...

294
00:25:27,527 --> 00:25:29,821
and the magic in your words...

295
00:25:30,447 --> 00:25:34,993
maKe me lose my composure

296
00:25:35,076 --> 00:25:37,829
I don't Know when I fell in love

297
00:25:37,912 --> 00:25:39,664
I don't Know when I gave in

298
00:25:39,914 --> 00:25:42,792
You looKed into my eyes...

299
00:25:42,834 --> 00:25:45,086
and said a thousand things

300
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:48,006
On the sly...

301
00:25:48,089 --> 00:25:50,342
you stole my heart

302
00:25:50,508 --> 00:25:53,219
On the sly...

303
00:25:53,303 --> 00:25:55,472
you stole my heart

304
00:25:55,722 --> 00:25:58,600
You stole my heart on the sly

305
00:25:58,808 --> 00:26:01,061
Lord, she tooK my heart away

306
00:26:06,775 --> 00:26:08,860
On the sly...

307
00:26:08,943 --> 00:26:11,363
you stole my heart

308
00:26:11,488 --> 00:26:16,618
On the sly you stole my heart

309
00:26:29,047 --> 00:26:34,094
Ladies and gentlemen, we
dedicate this evening to Shyam

310
00:26:35,512 --> 00:26:39,140
Friends, I'm happy that...

311
00:26:39,307 --> 00:26:45,897
Shyam has brought glory to
our magazine Garam Masala

312
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:51,152
Glory that maKes it
hotter and spicier

313
00:26:51,861 --> 00:26:55,990
On behalf of the company,
we congratulate Shyam

314
00:26:56,199 --> 00:26:59,994
we also pray for the
success of his American trip

315
00:27:00,078 --> 00:27:04,874
So Shyam's here's to you...
a Bon Voyage.

316
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:07,502
ThanK you, sir.

317
00:27:08,712 --> 00:27:11,798
Bon voyage, my foot!
Bloody freeloader

318
00:27:12,841 --> 00:27:16,094
A free trip to America for
stealing photographs. Moron

319
00:27:16,177 --> 00:27:19,848
don't you guys have self-respect?
Why are you clapping? Are you crazy?

320
00:27:42,871 --> 00:27:45,957
This friendship...

321
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:50,462
...we shall never breaK

322
00:27:52,547 --> 00:27:55,342
Stop singing, will you? Stop it

323
00:27:55,508 --> 00:27:58,470
don't sing on friendship,
please! Stop it

324
00:27:58,636 --> 00:28:00,722
Sing something else.
- Sing what?

325
00:28:01,765 --> 00:28:02,974
I'll sing

326
00:28:04,934 --> 00:28:09,230
You are made neither for
the earth nor for the sKy

327
00:28:09,314 --> 00:28:14,402
what maKes you sing melancholy?
- Your identity is...

328
00:28:16,488 --> 00:28:19,324
why picK a rotten song?

329
00:28:20,742 --> 00:28:23,495
Forget your friend.
He stole pictures...

330
00:28:23,578 --> 00:28:26,706
...won an award and
flew off, didn't he?

331
00:28:27,207 --> 00:28:32,504
So hear me. If you play the music
of honesty, you will go deaf someday

332
00:28:34,381 --> 00:28:40,220
Someone rightly said. Behind every
bit of lucK there's a horrible crime

333
00:28:40,762 --> 00:28:44,391
whose line was it?
- Not mine. Carry on

334
00:28:44,474 --> 00:28:47,185
whoever said that, he was right

335
00:28:47,811 --> 00:28:54,401
Money is truth. If you have money,
you have everything. Else, nothing

336
00:28:55,026 --> 00:28:59,197
You lost your house, your motorbiKe,
your girl... they belong to him now

337
00:28:59,364 --> 00:29:02,659
Moreover, he is your boss now.
Don't you want to defeat him?

338
00:29:03,451 --> 00:29:05,245
If I have my way...

339
00:29:05,328 --> 00:29:09,624
...l'll build a villa opposite
the house he snatched from me

340
00:29:09,874 --> 00:29:15,088
I'll have three imported cars
for the motorbiKe he tooK away

341
00:29:15,296 --> 00:29:19,884
I'll snatch all his girlfriends
away for taKing my girlfriend Maggie

342
00:29:21,219 --> 00:29:27,183
But how's that possible? The
girls we liKe, never liKe us

343
00:29:27,475 --> 00:29:30,478
And the girls who liKe us,
who cares about them?

344
00:29:30,687 --> 00:29:34,482
Don't worry about girls, moron.
I'll introduce you to beauties

345
00:29:34,691 --> 00:29:37,777
But wait, I'm not
running a home of charity

346
00:29:37,986 --> 00:29:40,739
My help doesn't come for free

347
00:29:40,822 --> 00:29:43,199
I Know, freeloader

348
00:29:44,075 --> 00:29:47,203
How wide does your mouth open?
- The size of your pocKet

349
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:52,250
But looK, today's girls don't
care for looKs but for banK balance

350
00:29:52,292 --> 00:29:56,671
They looK at the house, the car
and the credit cards you possess

351
00:29:56,755 --> 00:29:58,840
You dig, Romeo?

352
00:30:03,887 --> 00:30:05,805
Hi.
- Please sit

353
00:30:07,974 --> 00:30:13,104
He's the one who waits outside the
airport for you. Been a year now

354
00:30:13,188 --> 00:30:16,649
just to meet you, just to say hello

355
00:30:16,816 --> 00:30:21,613
This is pooja.
Airhostess. She worKs for Fast Air

356
00:30:21,821 --> 00:30:23,531
Hi. I'm MaKrand

357
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:26,868
Hi. I'm Sweety from HiFi Airways

358
00:30:27,118 --> 00:30:31,915
You can call me Mac.
- I'm deepti, from jet Speed Airways

359
00:30:36,086 --> 00:30:38,838
God spins the wheels
of fortune really well

360
00:30:39,214 --> 00:30:42,509
He turns a King into a
pauper and a pauper into a King

361
00:30:42,676 --> 00:30:46,513
It's not God who spun
the wheels. It's the fatso

362
00:30:46,596 --> 00:30:49,849
The chief editor. He helped me

363
00:30:49,933 --> 00:30:53,812
whatever. When Shyam returns,
he will boss you around

364
00:30:53,895 --> 00:30:57,565
And you'll have to obey him
quietly. - That's not worrying me

365
00:30:57,982 --> 00:31:02,362
But, Maggie Kissed him before me!
Well, I got three chicKs now

366
00:31:02,529 --> 00:31:05,573
Maggie looKs liKe a noodle before
them. - Where did you find them?

367
00:31:06,533 --> 00:31:10,537
Why do you worry about that? You
were supposed to show me a house

368
00:31:10,578 --> 00:31:12,872
Yes, the house...

369
00:31:12,956 --> 00:31:16,292
Stop droning. Tell me where it is.
- There is one

370
00:31:16,376 --> 00:31:19,087
where?
- You'll have to cheat

371
00:31:19,129 --> 00:31:22,215
I don't want to be jailed. Don't
get me into wrong things. Tell me...

372
00:31:22,298 --> 00:31:24,426
where do I find a house?
- There's no risK

373
00:31:24,634 --> 00:31:29,639
My ex-boss' flat's always empty.
He had bought it for his daughter

374
00:31:29,848 --> 00:31:33,476
She now lives in America.
The babe's real hot!

375
00:31:33,852 --> 00:31:39,399
But she is not straight, you Know.
She lives with a blacK guy...

376
00:31:39,733 --> 00:31:43,278
hasn't married yet. And her
father doesn't even Know about it

377
00:31:44,404 --> 00:31:47,407
Let me tell you the biggest risK

378
00:31:48,283 --> 00:31:49,492
Forget it.
- Tell me

379
00:31:49,659 --> 00:31:53,788
I won't tell anyone, I swear.
- I mustn't talK about the girl...

380
00:31:53,872 --> 00:31:57,125
Not the girl! About the house!
- The flat is always empty

381
00:31:57,208 --> 00:31:59,085
He is looKing for a caretaKer.

382
00:31:59,169 --> 00:32:01,671
If you can turn him
around and get the job...

383
00:32:01,755 --> 00:32:04,299
the flat will be yours.
- So taKe me to him

384
00:32:04,382 --> 00:32:10,055
If you taKe me, you'll never get
the flat. Rather you'll be thrashed

385
00:32:10,305 --> 00:32:14,392
why will he hit me?
- The man is ruthless, I say

386
00:32:14,517 --> 00:32:18,688
I had run up a debt at a liquor bar,
so I sold the tyres of his Mercedes

387
00:32:18,897 --> 00:32:22,692
I thought I'll put the tyres
bacK when I have the money

388
00:32:22,901 --> 00:32:26,696
He fired me over such a minor
thing. The bloody sonofagun!

389
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:29,366
All right, listen to me

390
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:34,496
I'll fix the old man. But I
need a car for those beauties

391
00:32:34,579 --> 00:32:37,374
don't worry about the car.
I'll give you a car...

392
00:32:37,415 --> 00:32:39,417
prettier than the girls.

393
00:32:39,584 --> 00:32:41,878
But you won't get the same
car daily. No guarantees

394
00:32:41,961 --> 00:32:45,006
Never mind. - Tell your
girls you got several cars

395
00:32:46,007 --> 00:32:48,134
Listen...
- Yes?

396
00:32:48,218 --> 00:32:53,890
No liquor, no cars.
Just steering wheels

397
00:32:53,973 --> 00:32:57,060
You are crazy!

398
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:02,190
Name?
- MaKrand Godbole. They call me Mac

399
00:33:02,565 --> 00:33:07,612
what worK do you do?
- I'm looKing for a job

400
00:33:08,738 --> 00:33:11,991
But I want to tell you
a sad story about me

401
00:33:13,076 --> 00:33:17,914
So you are a writer?
- No, sir

402
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:23,253
parents, siblings, uncle and aunts...
they are all I have in this world

403
00:33:25,505 --> 00:33:27,257
I'm their only support

404
00:33:28,299 --> 00:33:29,551
So what can I do?

405
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:33,179
What can you do? Give me worK, sir

406
00:33:34,889 --> 00:33:38,935
know how to drive?
- I Know. But I don't drive

407
00:33:39,144 --> 00:33:42,897
My horoscope predicts a major
accident if I drive for someone

408
00:33:45,358 --> 00:33:50,488
do you cooK? - I do, but I
always add too much salt

409
00:33:51,448 --> 00:33:52,657
what can you do then?

410
00:33:53,783 --> 00:33:59,080
Can you taKe care of a house?
- That I can do very well

411
00:34:00,999 --> 00:34:04,294
I don't normally trust strangers

412
00:34:06,212 --> 00:34:07,964
But you seem to be
from a good family

413
00:34:08,506 --> 00:34:11,092
I'm always out of the country

414
00:34:11,426 --> 00:34:15,263
I got a flat at port Louis.
Collect the Key from me tomorrow

415
00:34:20,852 --> 00:34:22,771
who?
- Open up

416
00:34:24,939 --> 00:34:26,024
who's that?

417
00:34:28,193 --> 00:34:30,153
I told you about him

418
00:34:35,533 --> 00:34:40,955
didn't I tell you? He's Mambo

419
00:34:42,457 --> 00:34:43,667
call him here

420
00:34:43,708 --> 00:34:49,714
Uncle, he is Mr.
MaKrand. People call him Mac

421
00:34:50,048 --> 00:34:53,009
Hello.
- Attitude problem

422
00:34:53,259 --> 00:34:55,470
did you tell him?
- Explained him everything

423
00:34:55,553 --> 00:34:57,514
Told him about me?
- Clearly

424
00:34:57,555 --> 00:35:00,141
I want a mixer, I
don't maKe chutney...

425
00:35:00,225 --> 00:35:03,436
...I want a grinder, I
can't Knead dough...

426
00:35:03,645 --> 00:35:05,772
I want a gas stove,
no outdated stoves.

427
00:35:05,855 --> 00:35:07,607
Washing machine.
Doesn't wash clothes

428
00:35:07,857 --> 00:35:09,109
He wants a dishwasher...

429
00:35:09,192 --> 00:35:12,028
...and a huge fridge,
because he can't cooK everyday

430
00:35:12,862 --> 00:35:16,282
Television. - If cricKet
is on, he'll cooK at night

431
00:35:16,366 --> 00:35:18,576
If it's a day-night match,
you will order something

432
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:23,665
I will go to the marKet, and
nobody questions me about accounts

433
00:35:24,499 --> 00:35:26,918
Sure. Anything else? That's all?

434
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:29,379
Can I talK now?
- Sure

435
00:35:29,713 --> 00:35:33,133
Actually... we are young people

436
00:35:36,136 --> 00:35:40,015
we play around and have fun. So...

437
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:44,394
I don't want any interference.
- I don't care. Do as you liKe

438
00:35:44,519 --> 00:35:47,647
My demands have to be met and I
must get my pay checK on the 1 st

439
00:35:49,399 --> 00:35:50,775
Fine. You are appointed

440
00:36:06,249 --> 00:36:12,172
when we first met, I was
wondering where I've seen you before

441
00:36:12,339 --> 00:36:14,883
Then I remembered where

442
00:36:15,633 --> 00:36:17,719
You are the girl I dreamt about

443
00:36:18,928 --> 00:36:21,014
know what this is?
- What?

444
00:36:22,766 --> 00:36:24,684
A ring. A ring that passed down...

445
00:36:24,768 --> 00:36:28,021
...from my great
grandmother to my grandmother

446
00:36:28,104 --> 00:36:31,983
From my grandmother to
my mother and then to me

447
00:36:32,192 --> 00:36:38,823
I was told to give it to my
life partner whenever I meet her

448
00:36:39,741 --> 00:36:44,996
And guess what? God heard my
prayers and He gave me a life partner

449
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,164
Really?

450
00:36:46,956 --> 00:36:49,125
What are you doing?
Why did you taKe it off?

451
00:36:52,295 --> 00:36:57,050
You are my fiancee now. I'll
give it to you the day we marry

452
00:36:57,217 --> 00:37:00,679
After that, this ring will
always shine on your finger

453
00:37:01,304 --> 00:37:02,472
So sweet

454
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,686
chhagan!

455
00:37:07,769 --> 00:37:08,937
Drive

456
00:37:09,854 --> 00:37:11,022
Babban!

457
00:37:14,859 --> 00:37:16,361
Stop

458
00:37:20,198 --> 00:37:21,408
come on

459
00:37:24,619 --> 00:37:27,372
know what this is?
- A ring

460
00:37:27,747 --> 00:37:29,916
But it's a very special ring

461
00:37:30,792 --> 00:37:33,003
A ring that was passed down from my
great grandmother to my grandmother

462
00:37:33,169 --> 00:37:36,715
From my grandmother to
my mother and then to me

463
00:37:37,007 --> 00:37:42,178
I was told to give it to my
life partner whenever I meet her

464
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:44,180
That's what I'm doing now

465
00:37:50,437 --> 00:37:52,355
what are you doing?

466
00:37:56,943 --> 00:38:02,365
Now that you are my fiancee,
I'll give it to you the day we marry

467
00:38:04,284 --> 00:38:07,495
After that, this ring will
always shine on your finger

468
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:09,497
I love you. Mac.
- Control... c'mon!

469
00:38:22,969 --> 00:38:24,721
Your fingers looKs so bare

470
00:38:26,056 --> 00:38:28,892
know what? This ring passed down...

471
00:38:28,975 --> 00:38:30,977
...from my great
grandmother to my grandmother

472
00:38:31,144 --> 00:38:34,814
From my grandmother to
my mother and then to me

473
00:38:35,523 --> 00:38:41,488
I was told to give it to my
life partner whenever I meet her

474
00:38:41,905 --> 00:38:44,949
And I found you. I'm so happy

475
00:38:47,077 --> 00:38:48,703
No... not now...

476
00:38:50,246 --> 00:38:53,416
why?
- You are my fiancÃ©e now

477
00:38:54,376 --> 00:38:56,586
I'll give it to you the day we marry

478
00:38:57,629 --> 00:39:00,465
Let me go.
- Feeling shy, eh?

479
00:39:00,715 --> 00:39:02,801
Indian girls are great

480
00:39:14,145 --> 00:39:17,065
I see the sKy...

481
00:39:18,316 --> 00:39:21,486
I see the earth...

482
00:39:22,487 --> 00:39:25,782
wherever I see...

483
00:39:26,574 --> 00:39:29,077
I find you

484
00:39:37,085 --> 00:39:39,879
I see the sKy...

485
00:39:40,046 --> 00:39:43,216
I see the earth...

486
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:48,221
wherever I see...

487
00:39:48,304 --> 00:39:50,849
I find you

488
00:39:52,726 --> 00:39:58,648
In every spectacle, I see you

489
00:40:00,275 --> 00:40:03,862
There's no place...

490
00:40:03,945 --> 00:40:06,990
where I don't find you

491
00:40:26,301 --> 00:40:29,971
who lent elegance...

492
00:40:30,055 --> 00:40:33,516
...to this marblesque body...?

493
00:40:34,225 --> 00:40:38,313
To these dreamy eyes...?

494
00:40:38,396 --> 00:40:41,441
To this beautiful face?

495
00:40:43,068 --> 00:40:45,779
You are my destination

496
00:40:45,987 --> 00:40:49,240
You are my desire

497
00:40:50,241 --> 00:40:53,953
The Spring...

498
00:40:54,162 --> 00:40:57,624
the marvels...

499
00:40:58,375 --> 00:41:02,379
and the stars, without you...

500
00:41:02,462 --> 00:41:05,048
I have never seen them

501
00:41:06,716 --> 00:41:09,844
I see the sKy...

502
00:41:10,178 --> 00:41:13,306
I see the earth...

503
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:18,144
wherever I see...

504
00:41:18,269 --> 00:41:21,272
I find you

505
00:41:23,983 --> 00:41:27,362
You're mine... and only you...

506
00:41:27,862 --> 00:41:31,032
You maKe my dreams come true...

507
00:41:32,033 --> 00:41:35,203
I want only you... girl, only you...

508
00:41:35,328 --> 00:41:39,958
I love you... Iove you...
Iove you... only you...

509
00:41:48,591 --> 00:41:51,928
From your eyes flows...

510
00:41:52,012 --> 00:41:55,557
a strange intoxication

511
00:41:56,099 --> 00:41:59,728
dazes one and all

512
00:41:59,894 --> 00:42:03,898
It's an incredible moment

513
00:42:04,274 --> 00:42:08,278
Your radiance captivates me

514
00:42:08,361 --> 00:42:11,614
You are my only obsession

515
00:42:12,615 --> 00:42:15,785
My love...

516
00:42:16,619 --> 00:42:19,914

00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:23,043

518
00:42:23,126 --> 00:42:26,880
a beauty liKe you

519
00:42:28,465 --> 00:42:32,093
I see the sKy...

520
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:35,722
I see the earth...

521
00:42:36,598 --> 00:42:40,435
wherever I see...

522
00:42:40,518 --> 00:42:43,063
I find you

523
00:43:04,501 --> 00:43:07,587
pooja...
- Honey, I'm here

524
00:43:07,629 --> 00:43:10,423
There! Hurry up, or we'll be late

525
00:43:12,592 --> 00:43:14,969
I'm sorry, I started without you.
- Never mind. No formalities.

00:43:16,012 --> 00:43:20,642
ThanK you. When are you coming

527
00:43:20,684 --> 00:43:25,772

00:43:25,855 --> 00:43:28,441

530
00:43:31,945 --> 00:43:34,698
Next day. OKay

00:43:35,115 --> 00:43:38,868
Tell me something, honey.
What do you Keep writing?

532
00:43:38,952 --> 00:43:42,455
Do you thinK you are a pilot? You
Keep tracK of every minute of mine

533
00:43:42,497 --> 00:43:46,167
Business is stressing, and I'm
busy. I have to sort things out

534
00:43:46,251 --> 00:43:50,797
So that when you come home,
I can spend time with you

535
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,133
we can be together. Water please

536
00:43:56,970 --> 00:43:58,096
Mambo!

537
00:43:58,221 --> 00:44:02,559
MaKe two cups of tea!
- MaKing tea is not that easy

538
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:06,563
It's a tough job. LooK at me!
You got to light the gas stove...

539
00:44:06,604 --> 00:44:11,609
boil water, put tea-leaves,
add sugar and milK to maKe tea

540
00:44:11,651 --> 00:44:14,779
prayers don't grant you tea!
- Mambo!

541
00:44:14,863 --> 00:44:17,866
Don't you talK about prayers!
Go and get some tea

542
00:44:17,907 --> 00:44:19,951
don't you scream at me! I'm not deaf

543
00:44:21,870 --> 00:44:25,915
Hear that? He has scissors for a
tongue. I told you to fire him

544
00:44:25,999 --> 00:44:29,044
why don't you KicK him out?
- It's no good

545
00:44:29,127 --> 00:44:35,592
The poor man is ficKle-minded.
Just yesterday he was praising you

546
00:44:35,675 --> 00:44:37,761
Lies! He never praises me

547
00:44:37,844 --> 00:44:40,805
when I first came here,
he treated me liKe a guest

548
00:44:40,889 --> 00:44:42,974
But now he acts as if
he's doing me a favour

549
00:44:43,058 --> 00:44:45,769
Listen, you are mistaKen

550
00:44:45,852 --> 00:44:50,190
He is liKe an old man
fed up of his children

551
00:44:50,273 --> 00:44:55,487
You get me? He's liKe your father.
His heart's full of love

552
00:44:55,570 --> 00:45:00,658
So why does he hide it? Why
can't he be liKe us, honey?

553
00:45:00,742 --> 00:45:04,120
How can he be liKe us?
He's an old man...

554
00:45:04,204 --> 00:45:08,667
about to hit the grave.
To hell with the old man

555
00:45:08,708 --> 00:45:12,837
who is an old man? Did
you call me an old man?

556
00:45:12,879 --> 00:45:18,385
Who called you old man? - I'm
not deaf. You called me old man

557
00:45:19,177 --> 00:45:23,306
Yes, he said that. So what are you
going to do? Will he call you a Kid?

558
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:26,393
Damn you! Your father
might be an old man!

559
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:30,647
She's going to down a plane
someday. Calls me an old man!

560
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:32,982
Airplane, my foot! She
can't even ride a bicycle

561
00:45:33,858 --> 00:45:38,238
I have told you!
Shut your ears. Please

562
00:45:38,279 --> 00:45:42,242
Say you will.
- Eyes shut, ears shut!

563
00:45:42,283 --> 00:45:46,663
Go and get the lady's bag.
- My eyes are shut

564
00:45:46,746 --> 00:45:49,791
Open your eyes for five seconds.
- If I find her bag in time, fine

565
00:45:49,833 --> 00:45:52,669
Or she leaves without her bag.
- Don't talK bacK

566
00:45:52,752 --> 00:45:57,757
I warned him. See, he
quietly went to get your bag

567
00:45:57,841 --> 00:45:59,092
Mambo, quicK

568
00:46:09,352 --> 00:46:11,604
Honey, I'll miss you a lot.
- Even I'll miss you

569
00:46:11,688 --> 00:46:15,442
I don't feel liKe going.
- Go on, you need to worK

570
00:46:15,525 --> 00:46:19,779
Go now, come on. Don't Keep
standing for too long. Bye

571
00:46:19,863 --> 00:46:21,698
where's she now?

572
00:46:34,586 --> 00:46:38,590
Did I Keep you waiting?
- No. I came only a minute ago

573
00:46:38,673 --> 00:46:41,217
But that one minute
felt liKe a hundred years

574
00:46:41,259 --> 00:46:43,303
come, let's go.
- My bag

575
00:46:43,345 --> 00:46:45,388
OKay lets go.
- Come.

576
00:47:03,114 --> 00:47:07,786
One leaves, another comes.
BangKoK departure, Singapore arrival

577
00:47:16,044 --> 00:47:19,464
Every time I come here, I see
that man in the same position

578
00:47:19,547 --> 00:47:23,343
don't you Keep him busy? You
are too lenient towards him

579
00:47:25,470 --> 00:47:28,098
what are you hiding?
- Nothing

580
00:47:28,181 --> 00:47:33,395
Then why are your hands behind you?
- It's his style. Never mind

581
00:47:33,436 --> 00:47:35,522
why doesn't he show it?
I want to see it

582
00:47:35,605 --> 00:47:39,275
I can't show it.
- I want to see. - TaKe her away

583
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:42,696
No whispering! I don't want
to see it. Keep it with you

584
00:47:42,779 --> 00:47:46,950
Let's go to our room and chat.
Get into a nightgown...

585
00:47:47,033 --> 00:47:50,787
No! I'm not leaving until
he shows what he is hiding

586
00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:54,332
If I show you, there'll be a storm!

587
00:47:54,416 --> 00:47:56,418
Come what may, I'm going to see it

588
00:47:56,501 --> 00:47:57,919
You want to see it?
- Yes

589
00:47:58,003 --> 00:48:00,255
You want to see it? I'll show it.
- Show

590
00:48:00,296 --> 00:48:04,175
My pants are torn, and
I'm not wearing underwear

591
00:48:04,259 --> 00:48:07,470
don't tell me I didn't
warn you. Want to see it?

592
00:48:07,554 --> 00:48:10,348
Want to see it?
- Damn

593
00:48:14,519 --> 00:48:15,895
Hold it

594
00:48:15,979 --> 00:48:18,773
I guess I deserve a raise

595
00:48:18,857 --> 00:48:20,692
In trying to save you...

596
00:48:20,775 --> 00:48:22,944
...my pants are really
going to be ripped off someday

597
00:48:36,541 --> 00:48:40,879
what are you cooKing? I don't
want sandwiches. MaKe malai-Kofta

598
00:48:46,092 --> 00:48:50,096
what's this?
- Call it anything you wish

599
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:53,767
we call it mutton cutlet.
- What? For whom?

600
00:48:53,808 --> 00:48:57,228
Mac only eats what I eat.
- AsK him

601
00:48:58,355 --> 00:49:03,693
Yes, honey?
- Whom is the mutton cutlet for?

602
00:49:03,777 --> 00:49:09,324
Mutton cutlet - why did he maKe it?
I thinK he has his way around here

603
00:49:09,407 --> 00:49:11,910
How can you stand it?
- You are right

604
00:49:15,330 --> 00:49:17,582
why did you maKe the mutton cutlet?

605
00:49:19,209 --> 00:49:22,337
Who did you asK before maKing it?

606
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:26,466
You don't Know who ate it?
- Do you eat mutton, Mac?

607
00:49:26,549 --> 00:49:29,052
When did I eat mutton?
- Did I say you ate?

608
00:49:29,135 --> 00:49:32,222
Then who ate it?
- Someone

609
00:49:32,263 --> 00:49:36,017
who?
- Want me to remind you who did?

610
00:49:36,101 --> 00:49:40,188
Tell me.
- The one who had omelette...

611
00:49:40,271 --> 00:49:44,609
Hang on! I remember. Just
tell me if I am right or not

612
00:49:45,318 --> 00:49:48,738
It was my friend Shyam.
- Shyam, who?

613
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:52,534
Shyam, who? He's my friend. He
came from America last night

614
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:55,412
when did he come? This morning

615
00:49:55,495 --> 00:49:59,207
Oh yes, this morning.
The cutlet was made for him

616
00:49:59,290 --> 00:50:03,628
I swear. You don't believe me?

617
00:50:06,172 --> 00:50:08,383
ThanK God you remembered

618
00:50:09,426 --> 00:50:11,678
Mac, there's an email for you

619
00:50:11,761 --> 00:50:14,180
From?
- Shyam

620
00:50:14,264 --> 00:50:17,767
He's coming from America tomorrow.
- Shyam's coming from America?

621
00:50:17,851 --> 00:50:20,812
You just said he had breaKfast.
- Who told you?

622
00:50:20,895 --> 00:50:25,066
Yes, I told you. But
this Shyam is not that one

623
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:27,527
who ate the mutton cutlet?
- That one's different

624
00:50:27,610 --> 00:50:31,322
The Shyam who's coming is my
friend. - Then who is this Shyam?

625
00:50:31,406 --> 00:50:35,410
Don't you Know? You brought the
email! - Who is that Shyam then?

626
00:50:35,493 --> 00:50:38,496
I have five friends named Shyam.
Do you Know all of them?

627
00:50:38,538 --> 00:50:43,084
I have five Shyams as friends,
and he Knows just one.

628
00:50:43,126 --> 00:50:46,212
He's crazy. He's very weird.

629
00:50:52,135 --> 00:50:55,180
SnaKe in the grass! You
Know when to grab a bite

630
00:50:55,263 --> 00:50:58,308
I didn't get this email, you dig? I
don't want to talK to that ingrate

631
00:50:58,391 --> 00:51:01,102
He wants you to
receive him at the airport

632
00:51:01,144 --> 00:51:04,647
My dog will receive him!
- When did you get a dog?

633
00:51:04,731 --> 00:51:09,110
Is that a joKe?
- LooK, he is your boss. You must go

634
00:51:09,152 --> 00:51:13,073
can't you tell a
lie for your brother?

635
00:51:13,156 --> 00:51:17,077
For a brother, yes. Of course,
with an open heart

636
00:51:19,537 --> 00:51:20,872
Happily

637
00:51:21,915 --> 00:51:25,877
Enough. I can't stand more happiness

638
00:51:29,673 --> 00:51:32,050
My flight timings
are going to change.

639
00:51:32,133 --> 00:51:34,844
We'll be flying only during daytime

640
00:51:34,928 --> 00:51:37,555
what time is the arrival?
- I'll get to Know today

641
00:51:38,306 --> 00:51:41,434
I'm dead. Got to
reworK the adjustments

642
00:51:41,518 --> 00:51:45,271
what adjustments?
- No... my worK schedule

643
00:51:45,355 --> 00:51:50,902
I'll have to adjust my schedule
according to your flight timings

644
00:51:50,985 --> 00:51:52,570
You taKe a bath

645
00:51:55,031 --> 00:51:56,116
Nageshwar!

646
00:51:57,867 --> 00:52:00,036
Yes? Tell me.
- Where's Mac?

647
00:52:00,995 --> 00:52:04,416
I don't Know. He's not
coming to the office either

648
00:52:04,499 --> 00:52:07,752
I've been looKing for him.
He doesn't even call me

649
00:52:07,836 --> 00:52:09,629
I left three
messages at his office...

650
00:52:09,713 --> 00:52:11,423
...but he didn't call me.
Please tell me

651
00:52:11,506 --> 00:52:16,594
I got to attend an
urgent meeting. Bye

652
00:52:16,678 --> 00:52:19,764
where are you going? One second

653
00:52:20,056 --> 00:52:22,225
Listen to me...

654
00:52:22,934 --> 00:52:27,731
You must tell me. Where's Mac?
- How can I tell you? I don't Know

655
00:52:27,814 --> 00:52:30,567
You are lying. I
Know you can tell me

656
00:52:31,276 --> 00:52:33,653
Say, how much is it worth?

657
00:52:36,072 --> 00:52:38,867
So you'd care to grease the palm?

658
00:53:01,806 --> 00:53:08,063
The worK I do here... don't tell me
what people call this profession

659
00:53:08,146 --> 00:53:11,566
But if I have to continue this,
you will have to double my salary

660
00:53:11,649 --> 00:53:14,319
can we sit and discuss it?
- Mac!

661
00:53:17,822 --> 00:53:19,199
What happened?

662
00:53:19,616 --> 00:53:24,412
Anjali is coming.
- What...? Who the hell told...?

663
00:53:24,496 --> 00:53:27,290
Who the hell told
her about this place?

664
00:53:27,374 --> 00:53:29,709
- I don't Know. I
saw her coming here

665
00:53:32,837 --> 00:53:37,425
You were supposed to taKe me out for
a movie and dinner, what happened?

666
00:53:37,467 --> 00:53:40,261
And now you have moved in here!
You didn't even care to call me

667
00:53:40,345 --> 00:53:42,263
If you don't liKe me,
tell me MaKrand!

668
00:53:42,305 --> 00:53:44,599
- Don't call me MaKrand. Call me Mac

669
00:53:44,683 --> 00:53:47,894
And stop screaming. I
command some respect here

670
00:53:47,977 --> 00:53:50,855
This house is not mine.
Belongs to my friend

671
00:53:50,939 --> 00:53:54,359
My office snatched away my house.
After I find a new house...

672
00:53:54,442 --> 00:53:58,154
I'll taKe you anywhere you want.
Restaurants, movies, anywhere

673
00:53:58,947 --> 00:54:00,073
Galan...

674
00:54:00,281 --> 00:54:02,659
what happened?
- Babban

675
00:54:02,742 --> 00:54:04,619
Babban, see the lady off

676
00:54:05,203 --> 00:54:09,374
But...
- Go on Hurry up

677
00:54:26,099 --> 00:54:28,435
Hello? Mac here.
- Pooja here

678
00:54:28,518 --> 00:54:30,520
why are you puffing?
- I was running

679
00:54:30,603 --> 00:54:34,733
Running? What for?
- I mean, on the treadmill

680
00:54:34,774 --> 00:54:38,737
There's a problem here. My
flight is delayed. I'm coming over

681
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:41,656
don't come here!
- Why are you yelling?

682
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:44,284
I thought we'd spend some
time together, but you...!

683
00:54:44,367 --> 00:54:47,954
Try to understand. Why bother?
I'll come to the airport

684
00:54:47,996 --> 00:54:52,125
No need. I've hired a cab already.
- To hell with the cab!

685
00:54:52,167 --> 00:54:53,668
I'm coming to the airport, pooja...

686
00:54:53,752 --> 00:54:57,505
Hello, Mac, hello!
- Bye.

687
00:54:57,589 --> 00:54:58,882
Who was it?

688
00:55:00,550 --> 00:55:01,926
A... relative

689
00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:03,595
Relative? Who?

690
00:55:03,678 --> 00:55:05,680
Close relative

691
00:55:05,764 --> 00:55:10,268
close relative, who?
- He's liKe half-father to me

692
00:55:10,352 --> 00:55:12,687
what...?
- He is my uncle

693
00:55:12,771 --> 00:55:15,231
But you yelled pooja!
- I did

694
00:55:15,315 --> 00:55:17,484
who was she?
- It was a male

695
00:55:17,567 --> 00:55:20,737
How can a man's name be pooja?
- Why not?

696
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:25,867
He's my uncle pooja. Get that?
His name is poojari

697
00:55:25,909 --> 00:55:32,123
kids used to tease him, so
he changed his name to pooja

698
00:55:32,207 --> 00:55:35,543
That's uncle pooja!
- The biggest lie ever

699
00:55:37,045 --> 00:55:40,173
why do you call him? He's
always busy in the Kitchen

700
00:55:40,256 --> 00:55:43,259
don't you trust me?
- No!

701
00:55:43,343 --> 00:55:45,512
I swear by my father

702
00:55:45,595 --> 00:55:47,514
Is he your father?
- Yes

703
00:55:47,555 --> 00:55:50,892
You never told me. - You
never had interest in my family

704
00:55:50,975 --> 00:55:54,896
This is when he was young...
with my mother

705
00:55:54,979 --> 00:55:57,357
That's the naughty me.
- How sweet!

706
00:55:57,399 --> 00:55:59,275
He even creates parents

707
00:55:59,317 --> 00:56:03,071
Uncle pooja is coming,
I'm going to the airport

708
00:56:03,154 --> 00:56:06,991
I got to talK business with him.
He'll be leaving by the next flight

709
00:56:07,033 --> 00:56:08,827
I'll be bacK. Get dressed
or you will catch a cold

710
00:56:08,910 --> 00:56:11,454
I'll be bacK

711
00:56:32,392 --> 00:56:35,145
Listen carefully. The
Mumbai flight is delayed

712
00:56:35,228 --> 00:56:38,773
If it lands here by chance,
don't let it meet the BangKoK flight

713
00:56:38,857 --> 00:56:41,276
I don't want them both to collide

714
00:56:41,359 --> 00:56:46,031
Because if they crash,
I'll die. Help me please

715
00:56:49,409 --> 00:56:54,456
Mumbai flight hasn't taKen off,
BangKoK flight is at home

716
00:56:54,497 --> 00:57:01,880
If the Mumbai flight lands,
the BangKoK flight will...

717
00:57:02,922 --> 00:57:04,132
damn!

718
00:57:08,928 --> 00:57:10,388
Where's she?

719
00:57:33,203 --> 00:57:35,121
Damn! I'm dead

720
00:57:58,061 --> 00:58:01,773
Mac? You are here?
- Where were you going?

721
00:58:01,856 --> 00:58:06,403
I was going to the taxi stand.
I'm famished, let's go home

722
00:58:06,486 --> 00:58:09,364
Mambo has taKen the day off.
Let's go to the airport canteen...

723
00:58:09,447 --> 00:58:12,659
we'll have chicKen breasts. Come on

724
00:58:24,170 --> 00:58:25,672
Hello?

725
00:58:25,714 --> 00:58:29,718
Is it early? All right,
I'll get to the airport

726
00:58:29,801 --> 00:58:32,887
Mambo, don't cooK
for me. I'm leaving

727
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:04,002
May I say something?
- Tell me

728
00:59:04,878 --> 00:59:09,049
I thinK I must've done some
good deeds in my previous birth

729
00:59:10,008 --> 00:59:13,386
That's why I get opportunities
to spend quality time with you

730
00:59:14,179 --> 00:59:18,600
Honey, you really flatter me.
- That's the problem

731
00:59:18,683 --> 00:59:23,063
If only I could rent my heart!
But you'll still thinK I'm lying

732
00:59:23,146 --> 00:59:25,106
Hi Mac!

733
00:59:25,190 --> 00:59:29,402
I've been looKing for you. I
thought you came to receive me

734
00:59:30,862 --> 00:59:31,988
Give me a hug

735
00:59:32,072 --> 00:59:34,616
Go and sit there, we are busy.
- Hi

736
00:59:34,699 --> 00:59:37,702
Hi. I'm pooja.
- We are best friends

737
00:59:37,786 --> 00:59:40,538
we can even give up
our lives for each other

738
00:59:40,622 --> 00:59:43,541
Not that best friends, oKay!
Go and sit there

739
00:59:43,583 --> 00:59:45,627
How can you say that?
- Join us

740
00:59:46,503 --> 00:59:48,088
Hi

741
00:59:52,092 --> 00:59:57,055
we used to worK together. I got
the International photography award

742
00:59:57,138 --> 01:00:00,183
Then I went to America...
- She is my fiancÃ©e

743
01:00:00,266 --> 01:00:02,102
FiancÃ©e?
- Yes

744
01:00:02,185 --> 01:00:05,397
If you don't mind, we want
to discuss something private

745
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:07,857
Find another table, please.
- Carry on

746
01:00:07,899 --> 01:00:11,486
You and I have no secrets
between us. She won't mind it

747
01:00:11,569 --> 01:00:18,284
She Knows the friendship we share.
- Such a pile on, you Know

748
01:00:22,122 --> 01:00:24,457
I have to report to my office.
- OKay

749
01:00:24,499 --> 01:00:27,377
Because, I told them I'm
going home. - OKay, darling. Bye

750
01:00:28,378 --> 01:00:34,801
where did you find that bombshell?
- Got to be handsome for that. You...

751
01:00:35,844 --> 01:00:36,970
what happened?

752
01:00:37,053 --> 01:00:39,055
What happened, Mac?

753
01:00:39,139 --> 01:00:42,809
What are you doing down there?

754
01:00:42,892 --> 01:00:45,103
I had lost my ring

755
01:00:45,228 --> 01:00:49,232
How come you arrived early?
- I told you about change in timings

756
01:00:49,315 --> 01:00:52,861
They called me suddenly. Departure
is rescheduled three hours earlier

757
01:00:52,944 --> 01:00:57,574
Hi! I am Shyam from America.
- Hi! I am Sweaty.

758
01:00:57,657 --> 01:00:59,701
This is my...
- FiancÃ©e?

759
01:00:59,743 --> 01:01:02,120
Yes.
- How do you Know?

760
01:01:02,203 --> 01:01:06,458
We've been friends since childhood.
We Know each other's choices

761
01:01:06,541 --> 01:01:08,918
why don't you sit?
- Move it

762
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:12,547
Here... here, darling.
- OKay

763
01:01:13,131 --> 01:01:14,632
Easy

764
01:01:15,508 --> 01:01:18,636
Is he the Shyam for whom
you made the breaKfast...?

765
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:21,765
Yes... the breaKfast... it's him

766
01:01:21,848 --> 01:01:23,850
when are you coming bacK?
- Don't Know

767
01:01:23,933 --> 01:01:27,187
New schedule, new timings.
I'll Know only after I return

768
01:01:27,771 --> 01:01:30,190
I'm getting late, I got to go

769
01:01:32,275 --> 01:01:38,531
Bye, Mac.
- Bye, taKe care.

770
01:01:38,615 --> 01:01:42,452
You are indeed lucKy. I
have seen fate looK up

771
01:01:42,535 --> 01:01:45,789
But this is incredible!
You are very lucKy

772
01:01:45,872 --> 01:01:48,792
Trust me...
- Mac, I got to leave

773
01:01:48,833 --> 01:01:52,253
It's time for my flight.
Love you, honey

774
01:01:52,921 --> 01:01:57,467
OK. Bye. Bye. _ TaKe care.
- TaKe care.

775
01:02:00,136 --> 01:02:03,348
Where do you thinK you are going?
- Incredible setup

776
01:02:03,723 --> 01:02:06,309
I can add spice to this setup

777
01:02:06,851 --> 01:02:09,604
There's my stuff. Let's
taKe that to your house

778
01:02:10,647 --> 01:02:14,818
Then we'll fix half a dozen girls.
We're brothers, after all

779
01:02:14,943 --> 01:02:18,822
Get lost. Don't touch me.
- Well?

780
01:02:18,905 --> 01:02:20,073
One cold coffee

781
01:02:21,199 --> 01:02:27,163
Swine! You cheated for that award.
And then you forgot me

782
01:02:28,498 --> 01:02:32,419
Then you got promoted and
flew off to America, all alone

783
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:37,632
You went blind, didn't you? I
decided then, to end our friendship

784
01:02:37,799 --> 01:02:39,300
You go your way, I go mine

785
01:02:40,051 --> 01:02:42,012
Excuse me! My bill. Coffee, separate

786
01:02:46,307 --> 01:02:48,268
Listen... listen...

787
01:02:49,102 --> 01:02:50,353
Friend...

788
01:02:50,645 --> 01:02:51,730
damn you!

789
01:03:15,462 --> 01:03:16,880
When did you come?

790
01:03:16,921 --> 01:03:21,468
I'll explain later.
First tell me where Mac is

791
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:25,889
His life's totally changed.
He's a high-flying guy nowadays!

792
01:03:26,056 --> 01:03:29,809
He has a posh flat,
exquisite, expensive furniture...

793
01:03:29,893 --> 01:03:33,646
three hot babes at his
becK and call. What a blast!

794
01:03:33,730 --> 01:03:36,566
How times have changed for him!
- LucKy dog!

795
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:39,402
So taKe me to him. Why don't you?

796
01:03:39,611 --> 01:03:41,821
Haven't you met him yet?
- How could I?

797
01:03:41,905 --> 01:03:44,783
I don't even Know where he lives.
- WalK into his office and meet him

798
01:03:44,824 --> 01:03:46,493
But how can I go to
his office in this state?

799
01:03:46,576 --> 01:03:47,744
I've just arrived from America

800
01:03:47,994 --> 01:03:50,872
LooK, Babban. Mac is
a close buddy of mine

801
01:03:51,122 --> 01:03:53,792
Even if I'm his senior today,
he used to be my senior once!

802
01:03:54,167 --> 01:03:56,461
LooK, I've got such a lot of
stuff for him from America

803
01:03:56,544 --> 01:03:59,255
I can't sleep in the night,
wondering how he could be managing

804
01:03:59,297 --> 01:04:03,426
Stop worrying about him! He's
doing just fine wherever he is

805
01:04:03,510 --> 01:04:06,680
come with me, Babban. I've
got some stuff for you too

806
01:04:06,846 --> 01:04:09,474
No, you must be lying.
- Lying?

807
01:04:09,641 --> 01:04:11,643
I've brought three
bottles of English liquor!

808
01:04:12,811 --> 01:04:15,188
What'll I do with empty bottles?
It should have booze!

809
01:04:15,271 --> 01:04:17,816
Empty bottles? They're
sealed bottles... full of liquor!

810
01:04:17,899 --> 01:04:19,275
Really? Let me see!

811
01:04:21,236 --> 01:04:22,320
Actually, it's under
all the stuff there.

812
01:04:22,404 --> 01:04:24,656
I'll give it to you at Mac's place

813
01:04:24,698 --> 01:04:27,826
You mean it?
- Oh yes. And some dough, too

814
01:04:29,661 --> 01:04:31,454
All right, let's go.
- OKay

815
01:04:40,005 --> 01:04:41,131
SpeaK up!

816
01:04:48,263 --> 01:04:50,432
Who's this mad dog?

817
01:04:50,515 --> 01:04:53,309
Uncle Mambo...
- That's my name! What's his?

818
01:04:53,393 --> 01:04:55,812
Who on earth is he?
- Uncle Mambo!

819
01:04:55,937 --> 01:04:57,897
The master Key to this house!

820
01:04:58,690 --> 01:05:01,985
So you're Uncle Mambo...?

821
01:05:03,903 --> 01:05:06,865
You're just liKe he described you
in his mail. You haven't changed

822
01:05:07,073 --> 01:05:10,201
The same nose,
eyes, vest and undies!

823
01:05:10,285 --> 01:05:12,495
I change my undies everyday!
Who the devil is he?

824
01:05:12,620 --> 01:05:16,249
Uncle, this is Shyam.
Everybody calls him Sam

825
01:05:16,458 --> 01:05:18,376
Mac's friend. He has
just arrived from America

826
01:05:18,543 --> 01:05:21,671
But why've you come with bag and
baggage? - Hasn't he told you?

827
01:05:21,838 --> 01:05:25,091
Who?
- My chum. I'm going to stay here

828
01:05:25,842 --> 01:05:28,428
No way... no! My sofa...!

829
01:05:28,887 --> 01:05:33,308
He forgot to
receive me at the airport

830
01:05:33,391 --> 01:05:38,730
I was so angry... sorry!
- Are you blind?

831
01:05:38,813 --> 01:05:41,399
Can't you see anything?
- He can, it's just a mistaKe

832
01:05:41,524 --> 01:05:45,695
I was actually so angry, I thought
I wouldn't set foot in this house

833
01:05:45,904 --> 01:05:48,073
You haven't unpacKed yet.
Better you get going!

834
01:05:48,156 --> 01:05:50,867
If I go away, he'll be
bacK to his old dramatics

835
01:05:51,117 --> 01:05:55,246
He'll fall at my feet,
cry... The forgetful idiot!

836
01:05:55,330 --> 01:05:58,208
Wrong! He never forgets!

837
01:05:58,375 --> 01:06:00,585
By the way, which room
did he asK you to taKe?

838
01:06:03,713 --> 01:06:08,468
But you haven't even met him yet.
- Oh yes, I haven't met him

839
01:06:08,635 --> 01:06:11,596
know what? Just give me a nice room

840
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:13,682
Nice room? You want to buy it?

841
01:06:13,765 --> 01:06:17,143
Are you married?
- No. Not right yet

842
01:06:18,269 --> 01:06:21,314
But I'm looKing out.
- What could be worse than this?

843
01:06:24,401 --> 01:06:27,237
No, not that one. That's
the bedroom he worKs in

844
01:06:27,445 --> 01:06:30,031
And that is a
bedroom he does not worK in

845
01:06:30,573 --> 01:06:33,785
He only sleeps in that bedroom.
Simply relaxes

846
01:06:33,868 --> 01:06:35,578
So many rooms! Is
this a house or a hotel?

847
01:06:35,662 --> 01:06:38,164
Even these rooms aren't enough for
him. - So where am I going to stay?

848
01:06:38,248 --> 01:06:41,292
There is a room for you...
butt's a bit too large

849
01:06:41,376 --> 01:06:43,336
That's oKay. It'll do.
- Will do?

850
01:06:43,420 --> 01:06:45,338
No problem!
- Follow me then

851
01:06:52,721 --> 01:06:54,931
Go on... beat it now.
- What? Empty-handed?

852
01:06:55,849 --> 01:06:58,059
TaKe all there is in
this pocKet of mine

853
01:07:02,022 --> 01:07:05,859
Only 2 rupees...?
- Why? Is that too much?

854
01:07:06,026 --> 01:07:09,154
Never mind. Keep it.
- Filthy miser!

855
01:07:09,404 --> 01:07:14,743
Here, Keep the 2 bucKs.
I'll give you 50 paise more!

856
01:07:15,326 --> 01:07:18,413
OKay? And you said you got
something for me from America!

857
01:07:18,455 --> 01:07:20,915
It's there for you. But I'm
not giving it to you right now

858
01:07:20,957 --> 01:07:23,793
I'll give it at an
appropriate time. - Really?

859
01:07:24,169 --> 01:07:28,256
If that appropriate time does not
arrive, I'll tell Mac everything...

860
01:07:28,340 --> 01:07:30,925
and your bad times will begin.
Just you remember that!

861
01:07:31,092 --> 01:07:33,553
And listen! If I can fix a
car that has broKen down...

862
01:07:33,636 --> 01:07:35,764
I can also wrecK a proper car!

863
01:08:08,672 --> 01:08:10,090
ThanK you.

864
01:08:10,215 --> 01:08:11,883
Hello?
- Deepti

865
01:08:11,966 --> 01:08:15,095
deepti, listen... I can't
go to the airport. I'm busy

866
01:08:15,887 --> 01:08:18,431
Go straight home, I'll be there

867
01:08:20,141 --> 01:08:21,434
I love you. Bye

868
01:08:48,420 --> 01:08:51,464
who are you? How dare you Kiss me?

869
01:08:51,715 --> 01:08:55,468
That could've been my question.
But I'm not heartless liKe you

870
01:08:55,677 --> 01:08:57,971
I hate debts. I repay every bit

871
01:08:58,096 --> 01:09:00,682
Shut up! Who are you? And
what are you doing in my house?

872
01:09:00,765 --> 01:09:03,101
That's my question.
- This is my house!

873
01:09:03,184 --> 01:09:06,396
This is my best friend's house.
- Who?

874
01:09:06,438 --> 01:09:09,024
MaKrand deendayal chatpatiya.
- Are you MaKrand's friend?

875
01:09:09,190 --> 01:09:11,818
Yes. Now tell me,
how's this your house?

876
01:09:12,235 --> 01:09:14,404
I'm Mac's FiancÃ©e

877
01:09:15,572 --> 01:09:19,117
I see. So you are the girl
who's going to marry Mac

878
01:09:19,659 --> 01:09:22,579
Aren't you ashamed
to Kiss a stranger?

879
01:09:22,662 --> 01:09:25,790
I thought it was Mac. But you
Knew it! Then why did you do it?

880
01:09:25,999 --> 01:09:28,877
Aren't you ashamed to Kiss
a girl you don't even Know?

881
01:09:31,212 --> 01:09:33,590
I thought it was Mac.
- And when I was screaming...?

882
01:09:33,673 --> 01:09:38,428
Can't you recognize a girl's voice?
- I thought it was Mac laughing

883
01:09:39,471 --> 01:09:43,475
All right, just forget it

884
01:09:43,558 --> 01:09:46,061
It was a mistaKe. Now that we
Know each other, why don't we do it?

885
01:09:46,102 --> 01:09:47,228
What...?

886
01:09:47,979 --> 01:09:51,816
Two negatives add up to a positive

887
01:09:53,151 --> 01:09:58,073
As a poet said, yesterday's
mistaKe is today's culture...

888
01:09:58,156 --> 01:10:02,452
and tomorrow's law.
- Did you really thinK I was Mac?

889
01:10:02,744 --> 01:10:04,621
If it's true, I'll forgive you

890
01:10:12,337 --> 01:10:16,883
Even if you forgive me,
I can't forget your touch

891
01:10:19,302 --> 01:10:21,596
I'm a rich bachelor

892
01:10:23,556 --> 01:10:26,685
But I have never
consciously looKed at a girl

893
01:10:26,810 --> 01:10:28,978
So?
- I love you

894
01:10:30,980 --> 01:10:33,566
I'm engaged. You dig?

895
01:10:35,819 --> 01:10:37,028
My feelings...

896
01:10:45,245 --> 01:10:49,624
I was just telling her
how much Mac loved her

897
01:10:51,501 --> 01:10:56,798
You tell her you love her, and she'll
Know how much Mac loves her. Right

898
01:10:58,008 --> 01:11:02,804
I mean, Mac told me to tell her...

899
01:11:02,887 --> 01:11:09,477
how much he loves her...
- Enough. Don't try hard

900
01:11:09,561 --> 01:11:10,645
Uncle...

901
01:11:10,729 --> 01:11:13,523
I'm not anybody's uncle!
- Ass!

902
01:11:13,648 --> 01:11:16,359
What...?
- One who calls you uncle is an ass

903
01:11:16,526 --> 01:11:19,487
what style, what personality...
what must be your age?

904
01:11:19,696 --> 01:11:21,781
Thirty-five? Thirty...?

905
01:11:23,950 --> 01:11:25,744
A bit older

906
01:11:27,078 --> 01:11:31,624
But if you discount all the
holidays, it comes to that much

907
01:11:33,251 --> 01:11:35,170
You are young

908
01:11:35,587 --> 01:11:39,507
You don't need to tell Mac
about what you just saw and heard

909
01:11:39,758 --> 01:11:42,469
Forget Mac, I don't
even tell myself...

910
01:11:42,552 --> 01:11:44,888
...about what goes on
around here. So relax

911
01:11:45,055 --> 01:11:48,183
ThanK you, uncle.
- Ass! You are an ass

912
01:11:48,224 --> 01:11:49,768
You called me uncle

913
01:11:50,977 --> 01:11:52,187
donKey

914
01:11:53,188 --> 01:11:56,733
Intruder!
- Here you are, my friend!

915
01:11:57,359 --> 01:12:00,195
Where were you? You Kept me waiting

916
01:12:00,362 --> 01:12:03,948
Hands off! Are you crazy?
- Tell me, please

917
01:12:04,032 --> 01:12:05,700
Tell what? Hands off!

918
01:12:06,743 --> 01:12:09,954
See his style? He loves me so much

919
01:12:10,663 --> 01:12:15,251
what love? Have you done
anything worthwhile for me?

920
01:12:15,293 --> 01:12:18,004
Why must you hide it from uncle?
He Knows everything

921
01:12:18,213 --> 01:12:21,716
Even I Know you in
and out! I hate you

922
01:12:21,758 --> 01:12:23,510
Hands off! Get out of here

923
01:12:23,593 --> 01:12:26,763
Get out of here! Out

924
01:12:26,846 --> 01:12:31,685
No matter what you say, but
my love for you is growing

925
01:12:31,851 --> 01:12:35,689
It's growing here too.
Not love but the itch

926
01:12:35,772 --> 01:12:38,817
Get out of here, or...
- Or what?

927
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:41,111
Let go of my hand or
I'll breaK your teeth

928
01:12:41,444 --> 01:12:44,406
what's that?
- My cheeKs

929
01:12:44,572 --> 01:12:46,116
what's on your cheeKs?

930
01:12:49,703 --> 01:12:51,955
Blood.
- How come?

931
01:12:52,956 --> 01:12:57,585
I had a shave this morning,
nicKed myself and it bled

932
01:12:57,669 --> 01:13:00,046
In the morning! And
it's grown already?

933
01:13:00,130 --> 01:13:02,048
Did you use a tonic for a cream?

934
01:13:02,132 --> 01:13:06,386
What the hell is that? - I
stopped shaving after I got the cut

935
01:13:06,511 --> 01:13:11,599
How come your blood is scented?
- Few good people have scented blood

936
01:13:11,725 --> 01:13:13,810
cut the crap! Get lost

937
01:13:14,644 --> 01:13:15,854
where's the phone?

938
01:13:21,776 --> 01:13:22,986
Was deepti here?

939
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:28,908
Where's the phone?

940
01:13:33,538 --> 01:13:37,459
Has deepti come yet?

941
01:13:40,587 --> 01:13:42,672
Anjali here.
- Anjali, who?

942
01:13:42,756 --> 01:13:43,965
What...?

943
01:13:44,049 --> 01:13:48,762
How are you?
- You've forgotten me

944
01:13:49,054 --> 01:13:52,515
I'm not a fool to forget you. -
Then tell me, what day is it today?

945
01:13:53,099 --> 01:13:55,018
Today? Today...?

946
01:13:56,227 --> 01:13:58,563
It's Sunday.
- Did I asK you, swine?

947
01:13:59,356 --> 01:14:01,274
It's Sunday!

948
01:14:01,358 --> 01:14:04,402
I Know it's Sunday.
But what's special today?

949
01:14:04,569 --> 01:14:06,780
What's special... today...?

950
01:14:06,905 --> 01:14:13,036
Is it Gandhi's birthday?
- No! It's my birthday

951
01:14:13,203 --> 01:14:17,123
And you forget that! You
never remember my birthday, Mac

952
01:14:17,207 --> 01:14:21,670
don't cry. I Knew it!
Happy birthday to you

953
01:14:23,421 --> 01:14:27,384
Then why didn't you come to
meet me? - You see, I got busy

954
01:14:27,717 --> 01:14:32,764
So I couldn't come. You Know,
I had been to the airport

955
01:14:32,931 --> 01:14:36,768
Airport? Why did you go to the
airport? Isn't it Sunday today?

956
01:14:36,935 --> 01:14:39,896
Yes, today is Sunday
and your birthday too

957
01:14:40,063 --> 01:14:43,525
All the shops are closed, only the
duty free shop at the airport is open

958
01:14:43,608 --> 01:14:46,695
I went there to buy a beautiful,
strong and reliable gift for you

959
01:14:47,612 --> 01:14:50,907
I got... damn!
- What happened?

960
01:14:50,949 --> 01:14:54,869
I'll call bacK later! - What
happened, Mac? You're coughing

961
01:14:58,081 --> 01:15:00,750
who was it?
- It was...

962
01:15:02,002 --> 01:15:04,963
what happened to your voice?
- Sore throat

963
01:15:05,213 --> 01:15:07,382
Anyway, there's good news for you.
- What?

964
01:15:07,549 --> 01:15:10,176
My flight timings are changing.
- When?

965
01:15:10,510 --> 01:15:14,764
You had a sore throat!
- It's fine now. When?

966
01:15:15,473 --> 01:15:16,850
It will land at 7:30 from tomorrow.

967
01:15:16,975 --> 01:15:18,685
You mean you'll
come 3 hours earlier?

968
01:15:18,852 --> 01:15:21,104
I mean, we'll get 3 more hours

969
01:15:23,231 --> 01:15:27,027
Tell me something. Only your
airlines have changed timings? Or all?

970
01:15:27,277 --> 01:15:30,613
All the airlines.
- ThanK God, I'm saved

971
01:15:32,282 --> 01:15:34,159
Saved? From what?

972
01:15:34,451 --> 01:15:36,828
What?
- You said, you are saved

973
01:15:36,870 --> 01:15:38,913
when did I say that?
- You just did

974
01:15:39,581 --> 01:15:43,084
No darling, I didn't say that. -
You said! You said it! You did too!

975
01:15:43,168 --> 01:15:46,212
Why'd I say that I'm saved?
- You did say that. I heard it too

976
01:15:46,296 --> 01:15:48,798
Hear that?
- Are you crazy?

977
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:52,260
I swear, I didn't say that.
This guy is crazy

978
01:15:52,344 --> 01:15:56,097
when did I say it? I don't
liKe your face! I'll Kill you

979
01:15:56,181 --> 01:15:57,349
I'll shave your head!

980
01:15:58,350 --> 01:15:59,476
Who is Sweety?

981
01:15:59,559 --> 01:16:03,480
Sweety? Who? Wherefrom? Which one?

982
01:16:05,857 --> 01:16:07,859
Sweety Nair! This
letter is addressed to her

983
01:16:07,942 --> 01:16:11,237
I want to Know who she is.
- Mailed to my address?

984
01:16:11,321 --> 01:16:15,575
Yes, your address.
- You are not Sweety Nair?

985
01:16:16,201 --> 01:16:18,703
How come someone else's
letter is dropped here?

986
01:16:18,787 --> 01:16:21,289
LooK here! What?
- Nothing

987
01:16:21,373 --> 01:16:24,459
It's your address. Sweety Nair,
13th floor, flat no.1...

988
01:16:24,626 --> 01:16:27,629
Balla Vista, port Louis, Mauritius.
- I don't Know who she is

989
01:16:27,837 --> 01:16:31,591
I forgot to tell you about it.
- Who is Sweety Nair?

990
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:35,929
Wrong address. It came earlier too.
It's for a guy downstairs

991
01:16:36,096 --> 01:16:39,933
Urmila's younger sister koKila...

992
01:16:40,016 --> 01:16:44,229
her son is BaKul. BaKul's uncle...

993
01:16:44,312 --> 01:16:52,445
was married to Rasila... it's
their daughter-in-law's daughter

994
01:16:52,529 --> 01:16:58,702
The postman said no one
was answering the door

995
01:16:58,910 --> 01:17:02,497
I gave him a glass of water, he
told me to give them the letter

996
01:17:02,539 --> 01:17:07,252
I said, I will. So you see,
this is his daughter... Sweety

997
01:17:23,768 --> 01:17:25,020
damn this day

998
01:17:26,187 --> 01:17:30,191
It's so embarrassing. My
own FiancÃ©e suspects me

999
01:17:32,485 --> 01:17:35,238
Sweety Nair! Know
who Sweety Nair is?

1000
01:17:35,530 --> 01:17:41,911
A 12-year old girl.
She's played in my lap

1001
01:17:42,037 --> 01:17:43,788
I'm so sorry...

1002
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:47,083
come here.
- Don't do it again.

1003
01:17:49,002 --> 01:17:52,130
I'm so happy we're bacK.

1004
01:17:56,176 --> 01:17:58,219
The old fossil ruined it

1005
01:18:14,444 --> 01:18:16,988
what's your intention?
Had you been a Muslim...

1006
01:18:17,072 --> 01:18:19,616
I would read that
you can have four wives

1007
01:18:20,325 --> 01:18:23,328
But which law offers
this facility for Hindus?

1008
01:18:23,745 --> 01:18:26,373
Not wives. FiancÃ©es

1009
01:18:27,707 --> 01:18:29,793
do you Know about
this FiancÃ©e thing?

1010
01:18:30,919 --> 01:18:36,841
FiancÃ©e is a facility that provides
everything that a wife provides

1011
01:18:36,883 --> 01:18:42,222
Except the nightmares

1012
01:18:43,515 --> 01:18:48,311
TaKe good care of women, and
you'll get the greatest intoxication

1013
01:18:50,563 --> 01:18:51,773
what are you doing here?

1014
01:18:52,857 --> 01:18:55,902
Didn't I asK you to leave? You
are guzzling my liquor, freeloader

1015
01:18:56,027 --> 01:18:59,781
Get out of here.
- How will you manage three women?

1016
01:19:00,156 --> 01:19:02,909
How can I leave you alone
in this mess, my friend?

1017
01:19:03,118 --> 01:19:06,621
You don't need to worry. I've
been doing it since my childhood

1018
01:19:06,705 --> 01:19:09,374
I'm really worried for you.
- Hands off!

1019
01:19:09,624 --> 01:19:14,421
You are not worried! You are jealous

1020
01:19:14,587 --> 01:19:16,506
Get out of here! Out!
- Where do I go?

1021
01:19:16,756 --> 01:19:20,176
Where you KicKed me out from!
- There's no tap in the bathroom

1022
01:19:20,260 --> 01:19:23,013
The roof is broKen, no pipes.
It's being fixed

1023
01:19:23,096 --> 01:19:26,599
I'll go there as soon as
it is fixed. Promise. Please

1024
01:19:29,185 --> 01:19:31,104
promise?
- Promise

1025
01:19:36,609 --> 01:19:37,777
what happened?

1026
01:19:41,740 --> 01:19:44,659
You consider me a stranger,
it hurts, friend

1027
01:19:46,286 --> 01:19:50,165
But buddy, you will
never find a friend liKe me

1028
01:19:53,293 --> 01:19:54,377
ShaKe hands on that
