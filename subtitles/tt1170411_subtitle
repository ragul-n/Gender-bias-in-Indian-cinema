1
00:02:13,499 --> 00:02:17,993
"As the ball travels
towards the bat..."

2
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:24,533
"...hearts skip a beat,
sighs are heard."

3
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:31,673
"Everything can change in moments."

4
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:35,283
"Anything is possible
in this unique game."

5
00:02:35,354 --> 00:02:38,755
"Cricket is our life, says India."

6
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:42,688
"Cricket is our life, says India."

7
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:46,294
"We love Cricket, we love the game."

8
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,467
"Cricket is our life,
it's our fame."

9
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:53,527
"Cricket is our life, says India."

10
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:57,632
"Cricket is our life, says India."

11
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:04,040
"Come on and play."

12
00:03:04,116 --> 00:03:05,174
"Come on and play."

13
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:11,314
"Come on and play."

14
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:12,448
"Play."

15
00:03:19,398 --> 00:03:21,332
"There's cricket here,
there's cricket there."

16
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,731
"Cricket is everywhere."

17
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:28,540
"Cricket in the sunny days,
or in the winter."

18
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:30,269
"Cricket, even during the monsoon."

19
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:35,740
"Cricket in the villages,
cricket in the cities."

20
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:37,482
"Cricket on the fields..."

21
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:41,145
"If there are no fields,
then play cricket on the roofs."

22
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,621
"Cricket is our life, says India."

23
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:48,558
"Cricket is our life, says India."

24
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:52,086
"We love cricket, we love the game."

25
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:55,664
"Cricket is our life,
it's our fame."

26
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:59,260
"Cricket is our life, says India."

27
00:03:59,338 --> 00:04:03,138
"Cricket is our life, says India."

28
00:04:11,183 --> 00:04:14,311
There is chaos on all the streets.
- Vijay Shekhawat is a thief!

29
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:17,049
There is chaos on all the streets.
- Vijay Shekhawat is a thief!

30
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:20,183
Down with!
- Vijay Shekhawat!

31
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:23,717
Down with!
- Vijay Shekhawat!

32
00:04:23,996 --> 00:04:27,397
Down with!
- Vijay Shekhawat!

33
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:30,995
Yes, it's the same cricketer,
Vijay Shekhawat...

34
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:34,029
...whom we used to
worship until yesterday.

35
00:04:34,106 --> 00:04:37,405
But he has let his fans down.

36
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,010
As you can see, an
angry mob has gathered in...

37
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:42,411
...front of his house in Jaisalmer.

38
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:44,673
This is Sanjay Sharma,
reporting from Jaisalmer.

39
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,012
Down with!
- Vijay Shekhawat!

40
00:05:15,047 --> 00:05:18,983
The Vijay Merchant trophy for the
best batsman is being awarded to...

41
00:05:19,051 --> 00:05:22,646
...Vijay Shekhawat of SVP Vidyalaya
(school) Jaisalmer, Rajasthan.

42
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:23,984
Yes! Thank you!

43
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:25,715
That's my son.

44
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:30,520
Father!

45
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:32,257
He made two centuries
and three half centuries.

46
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:35,030
Father! This is for you.

47
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:04,162
Down with!
- Vijay Shekhawat!

48
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,130
Down with!
- Vijay Shekhawat!

49
00:06:06,198 --> 00:06:10,294
'Father, one day, I'll be
the best batsman in the world.'

50
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:11,661
'I'm sure you will be.'

51
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,507
Stop all this. What's going on?

52
00:06:19,578 --> 00:06:22,570
What's going on here?

53
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,640
He is not in a state to talk to us.

54
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:26,980
And seeing the countrymen's fury...

55
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,111
...they will throw
him out of the city.

56
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:44,032
Ram Singh!

57
00:06:45,504 --> 00:06:47,301
Uncle!

58
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:49,000
Ram Singh! Ram Singh! We
can't trust the crowd!

59
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,133
They won't spare you!

60
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:51,540
Let's go from here!

61
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:53,407
The house is on fire.

62
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:55,003
Come on, let's go!

63
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,412
Hurry up! Let's go.

64
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:02,279
Move back! Come on!

65
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:04,149
Move back!

66
00:07:05,257 --> 00:07:06,690
Move back! Come on!

67
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,017
Hey, old man!

68
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,618
Where have you hidden him?

69
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:11,026
Get him out!

70
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:15,591
No, Uncle!

71
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:16,963
Don't go, please.

72
00:07:17,002 --> 00:07:18,560
Get lost from here! Get going!

73
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:21,367
Move back!

74
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,472
Move back!

75
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,447
Call the fire brigade!
- Yes.

76
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:31,376
The idiots have set it ablaze.

77
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:33,711
Why are you abusing them?

78
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:37,985
I would have done the same thing...

79
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:40,525
...had I been in their place.

80
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:10,154
Your son is like a
lion on the pitch.

81
00:08:10,489 --> 00:08:12,150
What have you fed him?

82
00:08:12,224 --> 00:08:14,454
Vedpal, your
coaching has borne fruits.

83
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:19,963
Hey, Ajit!
Complete your 50 at least!

84
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:21,294
I have played 102 balls.

85
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:23,198
I'm giving you the stand.
What else do you expect?

86
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:24,963
That's what you've
been doing all the time.

87
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,063
After all, I'm not Vijay Shekhawat.

88
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,299
God gifted player.

89
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:29,432
You are a politician's son!

90
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:31,107
You will talk diplomatically.

91
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:52,455
One day, your son will
take India by surprise.

92
00:08:52,531 --> 00:08:53,589
Take it from me.

93
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:58,299
Let's see, how the Ranji trophy
cricket selectors ignore Vijay now.

94
00:08:58,637 --> 00:09:00,298
Why do you look so upset?

95
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:03,000
I have to go to the toilet urgently.

96
00:09:03,742 --> 00:09:05,004
You are smiling.

97
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:06,135
We still need 40 runs to win.

98
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,679
And this guard is putting
pressure down my pelvis.

99
00:09:07,746 --> 00:09:09,338
Play without the guard.

100
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,210
Once you hit the ball, you can
relieve yourself on the pitch.

101
00:09:12,284 --> 00:09:14,013
Quiet! You think it's a joke.

102
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:21,617
Once more.

103
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:26,489
Six.

104
00:09:40,045 --> 00:09:41,103
Yes.

105
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,306
Seven six!

106
00:09:44,783 --> 00:09:48,446
I had to smash the bowler so that
you can run to the toilet. Go, run!

107
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,578
You are God!

108
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:51,054
When you die, I will erect
an altar in your memory...

109
00:09:51,123 --> 00:09:52,590
...right outside my bathroom.

110
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:06,394
Well played, Viju.

111
00:10:06,438 --> 00:10:08,736
After this innings, your
selection is guaranteed.

112
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:10,737
That's what you say each time.

113
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:12,136
Forget the past.

114
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:14,509
This time my heart says that you will
surely play for the Ranji Trophy.

115
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,638
You surely will.

116
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:43,564
Viju! Hey!

117
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:48,111
How are you?
- Fine.

118
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,704
Hello, Aunt.
- Bless you, Son.

119
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:51,044
Here, take the offerings.

120
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:54,246
Sweets!
- I'll have that.

121
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,212
He can have that.

122
00:10:56,288 --> 00:10:58,449
Vijay, I heard you
were very good yesterday.

123
00:10:58,590 --> 00:10:59,716
It was sheer luck.

124
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:01,054
Well done.

125
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,322
Can I take Nandu along?

126
00:11:04,396 --> 00:11:06,591
But come back before dusk.

127
00:11:06,665 --> 00:11:07,723
Yes.

128
00:11:08,033 --> 00:11:09,523
Madam, I too have to
leave for the office.

129
00:11:09,601 --> 00:11:10,625
Come on.

130
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:12,695
Nandu, this is my temple.

131
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:17,004
I need just one chance. Just one...

132
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:19,670
...to prove myself to the world.

133
00:11:20,245 --> 00:11:22,736
I'll break all the batting records,
one after the other.

134
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:28,349
I'll be counted amongst
batting giants like...

135
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,354
...Sachin, Gavaskar and Dravid.

136
00:11:31,256 --> 00:11:33,156
I'll live life king-size,
just like them.

137
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:34,692
Have millions of fans.

138
00:11:36,428 --> 00:11:39,022
When I enter the
stadium to play for India...

139
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:41,362
...everyone will scream out my name.

140
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:46,164
Viju! Viju!

141
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:52,535
Come here.

142
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:53,669
Come here and stand with me.

143
00:11:55,647 --> 00:11:57,774
Close your eyes and
listen to their cries.

144
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:07,049
Viju! Viju!

145
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:15,193
How much would that be, Nandu?

146
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:29,011
Viju! What happened?

147
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:32,407
Nandu, I don't think my
dream will ever come true.

148
00:12:34,219 --> 00:12:35,743
I can't even qualify for the Ranji.

149
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,480
Come on.

150
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:39,285
You'll surely be selected this time.

151
00:12:39,691 --> 00:12:42,421
Uncle was saying that the
selectors were very impressed.

152
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:44,688
I have been impressing
them for the past seven years.

153
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,027
But at the time of selection,
they seem more impressed...

154
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,464
...by the contacts of rich dads.

155
00:12:53,138 --> 00:12:56,699
They don't understand my pain.

156
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:01,040
Viju, don't say that.

157
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:06,375
If I don't get selected this time,
I don't know what I'll do.

158
00:13:09,721 --> 00:13:11,313
Don't sound so hopeless.

159
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:13,648
If they don't select you this time...

160
00:13:13,725 --> 00:13:15,386
...then I will personally
beat them black and blue.

161
00:13:16,995 --> 00:13:18,121
You are sure to be selected.

162
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:26,528
Mr. Ram Singh!

163
00:13:28,273 --> 00:13:29,740
You've come so late today.

164
00:13:31,543 --> 00:13:34,011
Hey Viju. Listen...
- Ajit!

165
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:47,589
Viju!

166
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:50,518
Did you read the newspaper?
- No.

167
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,030
I was selected.

168
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:54,156
They rejected you.

169
00:13:55,667 --> 00:13:56,759
I can't believe it.

170
00:13:58,237 --> 00:13:59,465
Congratulations.
- Thank you.

171
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:04,637
Viju, I'm sorry.

172
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,331
Why are you doing this?

173
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,532
What are you punishing my son for?

174
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:39,005
Who are you talking to?

175
00:14:39,077 --> 00:14:40,135
He is deaf!

176
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:45,614
Viju. Listen...

177
00:14:46,251 --> 00:14:48,014
Viju, what are you doing?

178
00:14:48,086 --> 00:14:50,680
Throw them in the dustbin, Father.

179
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:52,018
Don't be discouraged.
You have a lot of talent.

180
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:53,352
Of what use is that, dad?

181
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:55,090
How can this talent ever benefit me?

182
00:14:55,627 --> 00:14:57,026
Ajit has been selected...

183
00:14:57,095 --> 00:14:59,529
...just because he is
a politician's son.

184
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:02,366
I can't take it anymore.

185
00:15:07,005 --> 00:15:08,165
I am giving up Cricket, Dad.

186
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:10,100
What are you saying?

187
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,975
You are just 24...

188
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:14,308
...and you're
accepting defeat so soon.

189
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:16,977
There are so many players who
started their international careers...

190
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:19,574
...at much later
stages of their lives.

191
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:21,509
Take Mike Hussey or
Shaun Udal for instance.

192
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:22,645
Had they given up like you...

193
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:24,245
...they could've never
played for their country.

194
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:25,381
What do you want me to do?

195
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:28,391
Keep playing and fall
on my face each time?

196
00:15:29,294 --> 00:15:30,352
For how long?

197
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:32,390
Until they don't
break me completely.

198
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:34,391
Or I don't commit suicide.

199
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:37,197
No, I didn't mean that.

200
00:15:38,036 --> 00:15:40,004
I don't want you to
lose hope so soon.

201
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:42,173
Hope, Dad?

202
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:44,732
This is Jaisalmer.

203
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:47,007
A small city cut off
from the real world.

204
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:48,410
Even hope takes time to reach here.

205
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:53,609
Viju!

206
00:15:54,052 --> 00:15:55,110
Viju!

207
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:27,985
Ram Singh!

208
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,378
Here.

209
00:16:31,456 --> 00:16:33,048
Why are you so upset?

210
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:35,655
I have great news for you.
You'll be so happy.

211
00:16:35,727 --> 00:16:37,524
Come on.

212
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:42,625
Team India has reached Jaipur...

213
00:16:42,734 --> 00:16:44,326
...to prepare for their
forthcoming Australia tour.

214
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:46,000
The three day long
conditioning camp...

215
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:48,268
...has already started in
Jaipur's Sawai stadium.

216
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,001
And as you can see,
the people of Jaipur...

217
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:52,737
...are very eager to see their
players in action. - Viju! Viju!

218
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:55,277
Vedpal has come up
with such a great idea.

219
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,746
Tell him.
- Sit.

220
00:16:57,316 --> 00:16:58,374
Tell him about it.

221
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:03,410
Look, son, the Indian team needs
some local batsmen for net practice.

222
00:17:04,222 --> 00:17:05,951
The team coach will be present too.

223
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:09,452
If you are able to impress him,
then anything is possible.

224
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:11,485
Just come prepared tomorrow morning.

225
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:12,959
Isn't that a spectacular idea?

226
00:17:13,031 --> 00:17:14,396
No, I won't play cricket.

227
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,964
Have you gone crazy?

228
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,461
Players like you
are one in a million.

229
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:22,640
That's what dad and you think.

230
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,175
That's what we all think.

231
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,238
What will you do if
you don't play cricket?

232
00:17:30,982 --> 00:17:32,108
Anything, Nandu.

233
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:33,981
I'll manage the shop, find a job...

234
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:35,984
But I won't play cricket.

235
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:38,986
Does the entire
world thrive on cricket?

236
00:17:39,057 --> 00:17:40,581
Don't talk like a loser, Viju.

237
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,657
Cricket is your life.

238
00:17:43,161 --> 00:17:44,389
Can you live without it?

239
00:17:45,263 --> 00:17:46,594
What makes you think
I'm living, Nandu?

240
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:49,227
I'm dying for cricket.

241
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:42,585
I'd always thought that if I have
a son, I'll make him a cricketer.

242
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:52,323
When you were born, I felt
my dreams being fulfilled.

243
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:04,003
You were just five...

244
00:19:04,075 --> 00:19:08,671
...when I bought you
your first cricket bat.

245
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:12,016
You wouldn't go to bed without it.

246
00:19:17,088 --> 00:19:19,750
Dad, go and sleep.

247
00:19:24,629 --> 00:19:29,032
Viju, forgive me...

248
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:35,199
...if I've imposed my dream upon you.

249
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:01,531
Dad!
- Viju...

250
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,313
But Dad, this will
be my last effort.

251
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:36,258
Coach.

252
00:20:36,334 --> 00:20:37,631
You! You, come on.

253
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:39,068
Akhil sir.

254
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:43,064
This boy has come from Jaisalmer.

255
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:45,371
Give him one chance to play.

256
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,239
He's a fantastic player.
- Yes.

257
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:49,106
Look, this is not a selection.

258
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,238
It's just a practice.

259
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:51,680
Yes, but sir...

260
00:20:53,718 --> 00:20:55,515
Please!
- Sir...

261
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:56,645
Please!

262
00:20:56,721 --> 00:20:58,712
Please stop this nonsense.

263
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:01,258
We have come here to
practice and not to give interviews.

264
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:02,384
Please leave the ground.

265
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,518
Sir, please...
- Please show them out.

266
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:06,189
No, I am sorry. I am sorry.
- Viju.

267
00:21:06,264 --> 00:21:08,391
No, I am sorry. No interviews.

268
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:09,525
Please.

269
00:21:10,635 --> 00:21:13,035
Coach!
- What?

270
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:16,271
I am sorry, sir. I've seen
a lot of your interviews.

271
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,008
And you've always stated that...

272
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:19,338
...every able player
can play for India.

273
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:22,539
And the Indian team needs players
who have spirit and determination.

274
00:21:23,014 --> 00:21:24,572
I have both, coach.

275
00:21:25,016 --> 00:21:26,142
All I need is one chance.

276
00:21:26,217 --> 00:21:27,479
Just one chance.

277
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:30,077
Please move aside.
- Who is he? - One minute.

278
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:31,747
He's my son, Vijay Shekhawat.

279
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:33,689
Sir, he's a very good player.

280
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:36,759
Just give him one chance.

281
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:38,153
I'm pleading you.
- Please!

282
00:21:38,229 --> 00:21:40,424
Who are you pleading to,
Dad? Who are you begging to?

283
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:41,623
They can only give idealistic
statements in the interviews.

284
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:43,759
Shut up.

285
00:21:44,035 --> 00:21:46,026
Your politics
discourages many youngsters...

286
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:48,505
...who in-turn either commit
suicide or give up the sport.

287
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:50,370
Just like I am going to. Come, dad.

288
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:51,500
Please don't mind.
- Excuse me.

289
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,368
Excuse me, come here.

290
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:58,444
Every cricketer thinks
that he can play for India.

291
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:01,051
But to play for India,
you need to display...

292
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:04,987
If you have the courage,
then pick up the bat...

293
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:06,717
...or else, leave the ground.

294
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,234
You know why I named
you Vijay (Victory).

295
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:21,437
Go and smash the ball to pieces.

296
00:23:15,326 --> 00:23:16,384
Yes!

297
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:48,187
Sixer!

298
00:23:50,328 --> 00:23:51,386
That's all.

299
00:23:56,367 --> 00:23:57,425
See.

300
00:23:58,636 --> 00:24:00,160
That's an amazing bat.

301
00:24:00,338 --> 00:24:02,033
Is it made of wood or iron?

302
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:04,132
You should also
breathe in between the shots.

303
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:06,501
It was fun watching you bat.

304
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:08,409
All the very best.
- Thank you!

305
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,238
Best of luck.
- Thank you!

306
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:12,374
Are you the selector of Rajasthan?
- Yes.

307
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:15,176
And you don't find this
boy worthy of your team?

308
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,047
My son.

309
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,453
When is your next match?

310
00:24:18,523 --> 00:24:19,581
Tomorrow, with Mumbai.

311
00:24:19,657 --> 00:24:21,648
I want to see this boy
in tomorrow's match.

312
00:24:21,726 --> 00:24:23,990
Do you understand? - But sir,
the team has been selected...

313
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:25,393
Do you understand?

314
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,024
Vijay, just a moment.

315
00:24:34,038 --> 00:24:36,563
You are playing the Ranji
match tomorrow, against Mumbai.

316
00:24:39,077 --> 00:24:40,135
All the best.

317
00:24:40,211 --> 00:24:41,337
Thank you, Coach.

318
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:43,071
Yes.

319
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,547
Dad!

320
00:24:44,682 --> 00:24:47,276
Bye.
- Nandini! Nandini!

321
00:24:49,087 --> 00:24:51,487
Viju will first play for the Ranji,
and then the Indian team.

322
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:55,082
May you live long.

323
00:24:56,027 --> 00:24:59,019
Forget about me and listen.
So, quickly get married to Viju...

324
00:24:59,097 --> 00:25:01,258
...or else some actress
will entice him away.

325
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:02,691
Marriage.

326
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:05,263
You think the same way
as the rest of the world.

327
00:25:06,971 --> 00:25:09,030
Viju only
considers me as his friend.

328
00:25:09,974 --> 00:25:11,441
Is it? Then?

329
00:25:14,045 --> 00:25:15,103
Gone.

330
00:25:47,345 --> 00:25:52,078
Viju!

331
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:59,516
Viju! Viju! Viju! Viju!

332
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:01,422
Ten sixes and eighteen fours!

333
00:26:01,492 --> 00:26:04,359
I haven't seen a
better batsman than him.

334
00:26:05,029 --> 00:26:06,223
What do you have to say, Mr. Sidhu?

335
00:26:07,298 --> 00:26:08,356
Mr. Sidhu!

336
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:12,002
I am spellbound! Awestruck!

337
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,970
The runs were flowing in...

338
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:16,132
...like a gushing river-current.

339
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:18,437
This boy Shekhawat isn't
just knocking on the doors of...

340
00:26:18,509 --> 00:26:20,443
...the Indian team.

341
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,239
He is bringing them down.

342
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:26,575
The team must have
been announced by now.

343
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:29,985
Viju!
- Yes!

344
00:26:30,054 --> 00:26:31,715
The team must have
been announced by now.

345
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,282
Yes, it must have been.

346
00:26:35,526 --> 00:26:39,121
Are you nervous?
- Why should I be?

347
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,123
You are looking nervous.

348
00:26:42,333 --> 00:26:43,391
What rubbish!

349
00:26:43,434 --> 00:26:44,492
I'm not nervous...

350
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:48,602
...because I know, this
time you will be selected.

351
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,038
Really! You feel so.

352
00:26:52,543 --> 00:26:54,602
I know that. You wait and watch.

353
00:26:55,346 --> 00:26:59,476
If I get selected, it
will be really unbelievable.

354
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:02,449
Viju!
- Viju!

355
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:08,481
Viju.
- What happened?

356
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:09,617
Viju!
- Viju.

357
00:27:10,361 --> 00:27:11,419
What happened?

358
00:27:11,496 --> 00:27:12,554
Viju!
- Viju!

359
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:13,688
Viju!
- Viju!

360
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:15,357
Yes! Say it.

361
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,958
How do I tell you this news?

362
00:27:17,001 --> 00:27:18,298
To hell with cricket!

363
00:27:18,369 --> 00:27:21,133
God is very rude. He's never fair.

364
00:27:21,205 --> 00:27:22,433
Come on, tell me what has happened?

365
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:25,305
What to say, the
committee has decided.

366
00:27:25,376 --> 00:27:28,504
In the end, everything was fine.
Viju is surely in the team.

367
00:27:33,518 --> 00:27:34,576
Yes!

368
00:27:35,053 --> 00:27:38,716
Viju! You're selected.

369
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,596
Viju, where are you going?

370
00:27:49,634 --> 00:27:51,124
To tell father.

371
00:27:59,644 --> 00:28:01,168
Viju!
- Dad...

372
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:07,442
You're going to
play for your country.

373
00:28:09,153 --> 00:28:10,415
Keep it close to your heart.

374
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:54,292
'You're going to
play for your country.'

375
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:56,330
'Keep it close to your heart.'

376
00:28:58,436 --> 00:29:01,269
There are more than 100
million Indians. - Sir.

377
00:29:02,206 --> 00:29:08,076
And every Indian dreams
to play for team India.

378
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:12,276
We are a cricket-crazy country.

379
00:29:14,552 --> 00:29:18,750
But only 11 fortunate
ones get this chance.

380
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:23,260
Sir. - Sit down. - Yes.
- Please, sit down.

381
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:29,032
Vijay, their dreams, happiness and...

382
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:33,527
...pride rest in the
hands of these 11 players.

383
00:29:36,307 --> 00:29:37,501
And you are one of them.

384
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:43,642
Because now, they'll live
their dream through you.

385
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:55,183
You are next.

386
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,118
All the best.

387
00:29:57,195 --> 00:29:58,253
Thank you, Coach.

388
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:00,355
Coach!

389
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,698
Bless you.

390
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:13,009
Goddess Kali...
India's score is 58/3.

391
00:30:13,077 --> 00:30:14,135
Protect Viju.
- Bret Lee is on a hat trick.

392
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:17,010
Vijay Shekhawat is the next batsman
who is coming to bat for India.

393
00:30:17,081 --> 00:30:18,139
He's a new player.

394
00:30:18,216 --> 00:30:19,274
Mani, what do you know about him?

395
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:21,341
I know as much as you do.

396
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:23,148
But I do know that he
has played only one match.

397
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:25,348
He scored a double
century in his debut match.

398
00:30:25,423 --> 00:30:27,516
And that's why he was given a direct
entry into international cricket.

399
00:30:28,092 --> 00:30:31,220
The coach, Dilip Malhotra,
has full faith in him.

400
00:30:31,295 --> 00:30:32,353
He thinks very highly of him.

401
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:33,488
Viju is next.

402
00:30:33,564 --> 00:30:35,031
We've noticed many a times...

403
00:30:35,066 --> 00:30:36,158
...that if Imran Khan liked anyone,
or felt that he's a match-winner...

404
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:37,360
...he would give him a direct
entry into international cricket.

405
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:40,160
Don't be tense, Viju. Play well.

406
00:30:41,105 --> 00:30:42,163
All the best.
- Okay.

407
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:47,569
Brett.

408
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:49,506
He's your third target.

409
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:52,708
The players will surely put some
psychological pressure on him.

410
00:30:54,118 --> 00:30:55,176
Vijay, play your game.

411
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:57,118
Talking nonsense is their habit.

412
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:59,088
There had arguments
with Alan Border too.

413
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:01,057
The Australians are famous for it.

414
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:07,391
Brett Lee is ready
to bowl his hat trick.

415
00:31:07,465 --> 00:31:08,989
Vijay Shekhawat is ready to face it.

416
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:11,024
Brett Lee bowls... And
that was a close call.

417
00:31:11,102 --> 00:31:13,696
He was lucky that the ball didn't
hit the outside edge of the bat.

418
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:15,130
Considering the kind
of shot that he played...

419
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:16,264
...he'll have to be very careful.
- Careful, Vijay.

420
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:18,740
International
cricket is not that easy.

421
00:31:20,077 --> 00:31:22,204
He has played only one
first-class match. - Careful.

422
00:31:26,083 --> 00:31:28,017
The fastest bowler in
the world, Brett Lee...

423
00:31:28,085 --> 00:31:30,610
...can bowl at a speed
of more than 150 km/hr.

424
00:31:31,355 --> 00:31:32,652
Second ball on the helmet.

425
00:31:33,457 --> 00:31:36,051
And it will be a very big
test for Vijay Shekhawat.

426
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:49,096
This is no tennis ball.
This can crack skulls.

427
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:53,669
Are you okay?
- It's okay. Good.

428
00:31:55,112 --> 00:32:01,142
To hell with them.
- He shouldn't lose his control.

429
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:02,447
Take a single and
give me the strike.

430
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,317
I'll teach him a lesson.
- Okay.

431
00:32:20,037 --> 00:32:23,495
The ball passed right
through Brett Lee's head.

432
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:28,272
Very good!

433
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:33,215
What a ball-killer of a shot! It just
whisked and passed near Brett Lee.

434
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:39,420
Yes, what happened?
- Sixer.

435
00:32:45,096 --> 00:32:48,259
You were right, fool.
This ball can crack skulls.

436
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:10,712
Vijay!

437
00:33:26,304 --> 00:33:27,396
Come on!

438
00:34:15,319 --> 00:34:16,581
Just six runs needed to complete
a century in his first match.

439
00:34:16,654 --> 00:34:17,985
Atul, from whatever
little I know of him...

440
00:34:18,055 --> 00:34:20,387
...I know he'll try to hit a six.

441
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:22,323
So that he can score a
century in his first match.

442
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:23,985
And if you take a look
at his wagon-wheel...

443
00:34:24,061 --> 00:34:26,222
...he has played
shots all over the field.

444
00:34:26,297 --> 00:34:28,322
Vijay Shekhawat has
emerged as a complete player.

445
00:34:31,602 --> 00:34:35,060
Very few players get the chance to
score a century in their first match.

446
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:37,164
Stuart Clarke is
going for his run-up.

447
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:39,675
Stuart Clarke is ready
to bowl his next ball.

448
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,008
Vijay Shekhawat seems absolutely
prepared. - What's he going to bowl?

449
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:47,610
Again a short-pitched ball.

450
00:34:47,685 --> 00:34:48,743
And a pull shot.

451
00:34:49,186 --> 00:34:50,414
The ball is
travelling outside the ground.

452
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:53,082
No one seems to have a chance.

453
00:34:53,157 --> 00:34:54,215
And that's six runs.

454
00:34:54,291 --> 00:34:57,089
Vijay Shekhawat has scored a
century in his first match.

455
00:35:22,219 --> 00:35:24,380
The man of the match award
goes to Vijay Shekhawat.

456
00:35:28,325 --> 00:35:31,317
Congratulations!
- Great!

457
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:33,628
Well, Vijay, congratulations!

458
00:35:34,064 --> 00:35:35,122
How do you feel?

459
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:36,223
It feels... good!

460
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:38,025
Very good.

461
00:35:38,102 --> 00:35:41,230
As I've fulfilled my
father's dreams today.

462
00:35:43,607 --> 00:35:47,008
Father, I owe every run
scored from my bat and...

463
00:35:47,077 --> 00:35:50,274
...every moment spent
on the pitch, to you.

464
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:52,676
Congratulations, Ram Singh.
Your dreams have been fulfilled.

465
00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:56,082
How will you celebrate this century?

466
00:35:56,353 --> 00:35:57,684
By scoring another
century in the next match.

467
00:35:57,755 --> 00:35:59,689
Well done!
- Thank you.

468
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:02,957
The brilliant
performance of Vijay Shekhawat...

469
00:36:03,027 --> 00:36:06,019
...has added another chapter in
the history of Indian cricket.

470
00:36:06,096 --> 00:36:07,961
It seems as though
Rajasthan just sent...

471
00:36:07,998 --> 00:36:10,364
...a Vivian Richards
for the Indian team.

472
00:36:27,051 --> 00:36:33,980
Five runs to win.

473
00:36:34,058 --> 00:36:36,185
That was superb.

474
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:47,696
It's incredible century,
the way he promised.

475
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:58,071
He needs one more run to
win this game for India.

476
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:08,688
Yes!

477
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:11,687
Wow!

478
00:37:15,165 --> 00:37:16,189
Yes!

479
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:24,605
By four wickets...

480
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:28,073
Second consecutive
century by Vijay Shekhawat.

481
00:37:37,121 --> 00:37:38,213
I love you.

482
00:37:40,257 --> 00:37:42,452
You must be proud of your son.

483
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:45,290
Of course. So must be all of you.

484
00:37:45,996 --> 00:37:48,430
Viju is representing
the entire nation.

485
00:38:09,253 --> 00:38:14,953
Manika and Navjyot Singh Sidhu say
this at the top of their voices...

486
00:38:15,025 --> 00:38:20,395
...that this boy Shekhawat,
will make history in cricket.

487
00:38:34,712 --> 00:38:36,976
It's now time to
announce the man of the match...

488
00:38:37,047 --> 00:38:39,311
...and it's this man over
here, Vijay Shekhawat!

489
00:38:39,383 --> 00:38:42,045
Yes!

490
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:43,416
Congratulations.
- Thank you. - Well done.

491
00:38:44,154 --> 00:38:45,212
Yes!

492
00:38:48,726 --> 00:38:52,321
Don't you go anywhere now, because
you're also the man of the series!

493
00:38:52,529 --> 00:38:53,587
Uncle.

494
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:57,291
Congratulations again.

495
00:39:02,206 --> 00:39:03,264
Yes!

496
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:14,508
Hi!

497
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,679
The chief minister sir has called.

498
00:39:18,756 --> 00:39:20,280
The CM.
- Who is it?

499
00:39:20,357 --> 00:39:21,415
The Chief Minister.
- Hello.

500
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:24,756
Chief Minister.
- Yes.

501
00:39:26,196 --> 00:39:27,254
Thank you.

502
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:35,205
Welcome! Congratulations Vijay.

503
00:39:35,272 --> 00:39:36,466
Welcome!

504
00:39:57,127 --> 00:40:01,325
These days, all the girls from my
class are asking for your number.

505
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:03,123
Shall I give them?

506
00:40:05,502 --> 00:40:10,098
Viju, what's wrong?

507
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,538
Nandu, pinch me.

508
00:40:13,177 --> 00:40:14,576
What?
- Pinch me.

509
00:40:16,613 --> 00:40:18,103
Not so hard.

510
00:40:18,282 --> 00:40:19,442
You told me to.

511
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:23,345
I wanted to know if
this was all a dream.

512
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:29,654
It's not. Everything is real.

513
00:40:32,029 --> 00:40:33,360
Shall I pinch you again?
- Really, Nandu?

514
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:35,125
My life is on track now.

515
00:40:35,165 --> 00:40:37,224
I'm so happy, Nandu.

516
00:40:39,169 --> 00:40:41,364
My life is on track now.

517
00:40:41,438 --> 00:40:42,496
Viju!

518
00:40:47,211 --> 00:40:50,703
Andy Singh, India's
biggest celebrity manager.

519
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:52,214
He has called Viju, Uncle.

520
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:56,642
That means, we'll now see Viju on
TV doing really cheap commercials.

521
00:40:57,221 --> 00:40:59,121
Lux underwear and...
- No way!

522
00:41:00,157 --> 00:41:01,283
I won't do any cheap
commercials, Father.

523
00:41:01,725 --> 00:41:04,694
I'll model for cars,
mobile phones, suiting...

524
00:41:04,995 --> 00:41:08,123
That means, from a batsman,
you'll become a salesman.

525
00:41:08,432 --> 00:41:10,127
Check the tie.

526
00:41:13,337 --> 00:41:14,668
Is that fine, Dad?
- Yes.

527
00:41:15,606 --> 00:41:18,131
So, Nandu. How am I looking?

528
00:41:20,077 --> 00:41:25,242
Uncle, doesn't he look like one of
those guys that sell pills?

529
00:41:25,616 --> 00:41:27,345
Father!
- What are you saying?

530
00:41:27,417 --> 00:41:30,147
You don't sell
ordinary pills in a suit.

531
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,710
You sell imported ones.

532
00:41:32,556 --> 00:41:34,251
For indigestion.
- Hawker!

533
00:41:36,326 --> 00:41:38,089
Hawker! - Laugh as much
as you want. I am leaving.

534
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:39,254
Wear the coat.

535
00:41:48,105 --> 00:41:49,163
Sure, sir.

536
00:41:49,239 --> 00:41:51,434
I'll send you all the contracts,
and you may sign on them.

537
00:41:51,508 --> 00:41:54,272
If you have any queries,
you can call me.

538
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:55,536
Hi, Vijay.

539
00:41:55,612 --> 00:41:56,670
Hi.
- Welcome.

540
00:41:56,747 --> 00:41:58,305
I suppose, you both know each other.

541
00:41:58,448 --> 00:42:00,382
Mr. Jayasuriya and Mr. Mendes.
- Hi, Vijay Shekhawat.

542
00:42:00,784 --> 00:42:02,149
You know this guy.

543
00:42:02,452 --> 00:42:05,216
Hi, Vijay Shekhawat. - He's
the guy who destroyed Brett Lee.

544
00:42:05,989 --> 00:42:08,253
Hi.
- Nice meeting you all.

545
00:42:08,325 --> 00:42:13,126
Okay, bye. Let's go.

546
00:42:14,231 --> 00:42:15,698
Are they Andy's clients?
- Yes!

547
00:42:18,502 --> 00:42:20,094
Mr. Singh will join you soon.

548
00:42:20,304 --> 00:42:21,396
It's okay.

549
00:42:31,748 --> 00:42:35,081
All right, let's do this.

550
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:40,151
Okay.
- This is one of my favorite.

551
00:42:55,272 --> 00:43:02,405
Yes Yuvi, we'll finalise the
watch endorsement contract.

552
00:43:03,313 --> 00:43:05,508
Fine, let's have lunch tomorrow.

553
00:43:06,049 --> 00:43:07,482
Okay, bye.
- Sir.

554
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:12,654
I'm a straightforward man.
I don't talk in riddles.

555
00:43:14,424 --> 00:43:16,324
Do you like money?
- What?

556
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:20,128
Good, bad, ugly.

557
00:43:22,332 --> 00:43:23,390
Good.

558
00:43:23,433 --> 00:43:27,392
Good, I'll make you
the most successful...

559
00:43:27,504 --> 00:43:29,438
...and the richest sports star.

560
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:35,110
Let our company manage all
your business and marketing.

561
00:43:36,413 --> 00:43:38,347
Here is a small advance.

562
00:43:44,388 --> 00:43:46,413
Four million rupees.
- Forty million.

563
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:52,018
I will help you rake
in so much money...

564
00:43:52,095 --> 00:43:55,326
...you must've not seen in
the wildest of your dreams.

565
00:43:55,465 --> 00:43:56,523
So, it's a deal.

566
00:43:58,168 --> 00:43:59,226
Yes.

567
00:43:59,336 --> 00:44:01,964
Prince of Jaisalmer,
let's celebrate.

568
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:03,097
What will you have?

569
00:44:03,173 --> 00:44:04,231
I don't drink and...

570
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:08,605
None of the sportsmen
drink at the outset.

571
00:44:11,481 --> 00:44:13,449
Forty. Wow!

572
00:44:13,517 --> 00:44:16,543
How wonderful,
Viju! Look, Ram Singh.

573
00:44:17,287 --> 00:44:19,118
40 million.
- A cheque for 40 million.

574
00:44:19,189 --> 00:44:20,247
For 40 million.

575
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:22,121
Nice. Now, quickly keep it
next to the temple, Son.

576
00:44:22,192 --> 00:44:23,591
Your heart must be
thumping with joy. - Father!

577
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:25,651
But you're still asking him to
keep the cheque in the temple.

578
00:44:25,729 --> 00:44:26,991
Viju has made you a millionaire!

579
00:44:27,064 --> 00:44:28,622
A millionaire, Ram Singh.

580
00:44:28,732 --> 00:44:30,324
Father, lets buy a new house.

581
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:31,624
This house is very old.

582
00:44:31,702 --> 00:44:34,227
No! Your grandfather
had made this house.

583
00:44:34,304 --> 00:44:35,464
I'll stay in this house.

584
00:44:36,273 --> 00:44:38,332
In that case, let's buy a big car.

585
00:44:38,408 --> 00:44:39,466
Mercedes.

586
00:44:39,543 --> 00:44:40,601
Hey, Mercedes? What will I do...

587
00:44:40,677 --> 00:44:42,076
Then why don't you
go on a world tour?

588
00:44:42,145 --> 00:44:45,114
Yes, Ram Singh.
Visit London and Tokyo.

589
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:47,673
We'll come along. Right, Chander?
- Yes!

590
00:44:47,751 --> 00:44:49,412
Fools, what are you all saying?

591
00:44:49,486 --> 00:44:50,544
Son, do one thing.

592
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:52,144
Deposit this cheque in the bank.

593
00:44:52,222 --> 00:44:53,348
They'll get good interest.

594
00:44:53,423 --> 00:44:56,483
Interest! Father, I
want to see you happy.

595
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,118
You are playing for our country.

596
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:00,254
What can make me happier than that?

597
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:01,297
What is he saying?

598
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:03,461
Father, I can never understand you.

599
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:05,258
But I...
- I will show this cheque to Nandu.

600
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:06,393
At least, she will be happy.

601
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:09,405
I'm happy too, Son. Don't get upset.

602
00:45:09,539 --> 00:45:12,303
Nandu, watch carefully.
It's a cheque of 40 million.

603
00:45:12,709 --> 00:45:14,370
Father didn't even
give it a second look.

604
00:45:14,978 --> 00:45:16,411
But I am.

605
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,675
All he said was to go
deposit it in the bank.

606
00:45:18,982 --> 00:45:20,040
And that I'll get interest for it.

607
00:45:20,117 --> 00:45:21,379
He shouldn't have said that.

608
00:45:21,451 --> 00:45:23,476
Exactly. He spoilt my mood.

609
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,551
I had thought of such
amazing things for him.

610
00:45:25,622 --> 00:45:26,987
That I'll buy a bungalow...

611
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:29,048
...a few cars for him, provide
him with a lavish lifestyle.

612
00:45:29,192 --> 00:45:32,218
Lavish lifestyle... - You
want to give him a lavish life.

613
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:38,295
How? Okay, go tell
him to have fun. Sorry.

614
00:45:39,002 --> 00:45:40,492
Viju, you look so cute.

615
00:45:40,537 --> 00:45:41,731
Nandu, return me my cheque.

616
00:45:42,339 --> 00:45:44,102
Everyone in Jaisalmer is the same.

617
00:45:44,174 --> 00:45:45,505
You don't know how much
the world respects me.

618
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:48,169
Andy Singh calls me
the Prince of Jaisalmer.

619
00:45:50,013 --> 00:45:54,677
Prince... Prince...
Forgive my impudence.

620
00:45:55,218 --> 00:45:57,618
Nandu, I want to
give father everything.

621
00:45:58,088 --> 00:45:59,146
You tell dad.

622
00:45:59,756 --> 00:46:02,452
Simple. You are a prince.

623
00:46:02,692 --> 00:46:06,184
Issue an order that, father, go
and have a good time right now.

624
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,455
Uncle won't have the
courage to refuse a prince.

625
00:46:09,066 --> 00:46:10,966
Nandu...

626
00:46:11,001 --> 00:46:12,366
Wait, I will show you.

627
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:15,062
Viju.

628
00:46:22,312 --> 00:46:25,645
India, there's all sorts
of trouble here 160/5...

629
00:46:25,715 --> 00:46:28,479
...and this boy walks to
the crease, Vijay Shekhawat.

630
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:31,378
Beautiful shot.

631
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:34,322
A magnificent shot and the
ball has left the field!

632
00:46:34,391 --> 00:46:36,552
And that's a six!

633
00:46:38,328 --> 00:46:40,455
"Vijay, we want victory."

634
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:44,191
"Listen to the heart,
it wants victory."

635
00:46:45,602 --> 00:46:47,297
"We want to wear the
crown of victory."

636
00:46:47,404 --> 00:46:49,235
"Victory! Victory!"

637
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:51,137
"India wants victory!"

638
00:46:51,208 --> 00:46:56,441
"Victory! Victory!"

639
00:47:07,357 --> 00:47:08,483
"Vijay, we want victory."

640
00:47:08,558 --> 00:47:10,116
"Listen to the heart,
it wants victory."

641
00:47:10,193 --> 00:47:11,387
"We want to wear the
crown of victory."

642
00:47:11,461 --> 00:47:14,487
"India wants victory!"

643
00:47:18,268 --> 00:47:19,997
"Pick up the bat."

644
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:21,560
"Hit a six."

645
00:47:21,972 --> 00:47:23,303
"Swing the bat."

646
00:47:23,373 --> 00:47:25,967
With the help of Vijay
Shekhawat's century...

647
00:47:26,042 --> 00:47:28,340
...team India defeats South Africa.

648
00:47:28,411 --> 00:47:30,311
And wins the series 2-0.

649
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:32,605
"Make India win!"

650
00:47:32,682 --> 00:47:34,115
"Swing the bat."

651
00:47:34,417 --> 00:47:35,714
"Hit a six."

652
00:47:36,286 --> 00:47:37,583
"Swing the bat."

653
00:47:38,155 --> 00:47:39,315
"Hit a six."

654
00:47:39,689 --> 00:47:41,520
"Pump up the adrenaline."

655
00:47:41,591 --> 00:47:43,491
"Shock them out of their wits."

656
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:46,324
"Grab victory for India."

657
00:47:46,396 --> 00:47:48,296
Hey, prince, you have to
attend a marriage tomorrow night.

658
00:47:48,331 --> 00:47:49,423
They are willing
to pay five million.

659
00:47:49,499 --> 00:47:50,523
You have to be there
for only ten minutes.

660
00:47:51,101 --> 00:47:54,434
Andy, I am a cricketer.
Not a buffoon.

661
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:57,701
"Swing the bat. Hit a six."

662
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:04,070
There's been a prince in cricket.

663
00:48:04,414 --> 00:48:05,676
There's been a king in cricket.

664
00:48:06,082 --> 00:48:08,050
Now, there's an emperor in cricket.

665
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:13,447
Vijay!

666
00:48:14,291 --> 00:48:15,349
Vijay!

667
00:48:16,026 --> 00:48:17,118
Vijay!

668
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:19,085
Vijay!

669
00:48:19,162 --> 00:48:20,959
"Show them your skill,
show them your style."

670
00:48:20,997 --> 00:48:22,362
"Show them your game."

671
00:48:22,499 --> 00:48:26,162
"Crush the opponents."

672
00:48:26,269 --> 00:48:28,237
"You are the strength of India."

673
00:48:28,305 --> 00:48:29,966
"Vijay! Vijay!"

674
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,632
"You are India's pride!"

675
00:48:31,708 --> 00:48:33,573
"Vijay! Vijay!"

676
00:48:33,977 --> 00:48:37,469
"No one can stop you."

677
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:39,139
"Swing the bat."

678
00:48:39,316 --> 00:48:41,079
Hit a six.

679
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:42,445
"Swing the bat."

680
00:48:42,686 --> 00:48:44,415
Thankfully, I am retired now.

681
00:48:44,487 --> 00:48:46,614
At least, I don't have to
bowl to Vijay Shekhawat.

682
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:51,087
Hi.
- Dinner.

683
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:53,320
Ponting...

684
00:48:54,064 --> 00:48:56,624
Vijay Shekhawat, caught behind.

685
00:49:00,503 --> 00:49:01,595
How was it?

686
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:03,499
You look like a hero.

687
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:18,076
Vijay!

688
00:49:18,154 --> 00:49:19,212
Fool...

689
00:49:21,091 --> 00:49:23,457
Viju is only mine.

690
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:26,686
Autograph, please.
- Move back.

691
00:49:26,763 --> 00:49:28,355
Gentlemen, to the deal.

692
00:49:28,431 --> 00:49:29,455
Vijay Shekhawat.

693
00:49:32,435 --> 00:49:35,495
Vijay!

694
00:49:36,206 --> 00:49:39,198
Vijay!

695
00:49:39,276 --> 00:49:41,107
"The bowler and the
fielder seem distressed."

696
00:49:41,177 --> 00:49:46,376
"Everyone is thinking
how to stop this storm."

697
00:49:46,449 --> 00:49:50,112
"Everyone wants Vijay!"

698
00:49:50,186 --> 00:49:52,120
"Like the crack of the whip."

699
00:49:52,188 --> 00:49:53,655
"Vijay! Vijay!"

700
00:49:54,124 --> 00:49:57,719
"The tricolour soars high again."

701
00:49:57,794 --> 00:50:05,291
East or west, Vijay
Shekhawat is the best.'

702
00:50:05,402 --> 00:50:10,135
Any batsman who can break my fastest
50 record, it is Vijay Shekhawat.

703
00:50:11,741 --> 00:50:13,538
"He is the pride and the joy."

704
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:15,305
"Vijay! Vijay!"

705
00:50:15,378 --> 00:50:17,175
"He is our symbol."

706
00:50:17,247 --> 00:50:19,078
"Vijay! Vijay!"

707
00:50:19,149 --> 00:50:21,014
"He is the glory."

708
00:50:21,084 --> 00:50:22,517
"Vijay! Vijay!"

709
00:50:22,585 --> 00:50:24,075
"The pride of India."

710
00:50:24,154 --> 00:50:28,352
The winner of the ICC one day
international player of the year is...

711
00:50:30,226 --> 00:50:33,491
...Vijay Shekhawat.
He is just fabulous.

712
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:35,255
"Swing the bat."

713
00:50:35,465 --> 00:50:37,057
"Hit another six."

714
00:50:37,167 --> 00:50:39,067
"Swing the bat."

715
00:50:39,135 --> 00:50:40,432
"Hit another six."

716
00:50:41,104 --> 00:50:44,369
Thank you everyone.
Thank you for this.

717
00:50:45,041 --> 00:50:50,035
I am pleased to announce,
the ICC batsman of the year...

718
00:50:50,113 --> 00:50:53,048
...Mr. Vijay Shekhawat...

719
00:50:53,116 --> 00:50:58,383
...has decided to extend our
relations for another three years.

720
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:00,621
Ladies and gentlemen...

721
00:51:00,790 --> 00:51:04,521
I am proud to announce the
biggest sports deal ever in India.

722
00:51:05,095 --> 00:51:09,623
A deal for one hundred
crore for three years.

723
00:51:15,538 --> 00:51:16,596
Andy...

724
00:51:16,673 --> 00:51:19,164
A hundred crore is nothing when
compared to your talent, my friend.

725
00:51:19,442 --> 00:51:20,500
Fantastic.

726
00:51:22,278 --> 00:51:28,114
I now request Mr. Shekhawat to
accept an advance of 100 million.

727
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:41,052
And ladies and gentlemen, I
present Mr. Vijay Shekhawat to you.

728
00:51:41,164 --> 00:51:42,563
All yours.
- Thank you.

729
00:51:46,536 --> 00:51:48,629
One billion is not much.

730
00:51:48,705 --> 00:51:49,763
How do you feel, Mr. Shekhawat?

731
00:51:50,039 --> 00:51:51,506
A deal for one billion.
It feels very nice.

732
00:51:52,242 --> 00:51:55,211
I have brought myself a
hen that lays golden eggs.

733
00:51:55,378 --> 00:51:58,472
Vijay Shekhawat will earn me one
billion back through commission.

734
00:51:58,548 --> 00:52:01,517
What if someday he stops
laying the golden eggs?

735
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:06,253
This hen is addicted to success.
It will only lay golden eggs.

736
00:52:06,389 --> 00:52:11,190
Andy Singh... he is
like a brother to me.

737
00:52:13,496 --> 00:52:15,430
Love you, my friend. Love you!

738
00:52:18,701 --> 00:52:21,727
Son, why did you call me to Mumbai
instead of coming to Jaisalmer?

739
00:52:22,005 --> 00:52:25,532
Dad, there's a surprise for you.

740
00:52:26,276 --> 00:52:28,744
We should go back soon.
It's the tourist season.

741
00:52:33,416 --> 00:52:37,216
Dad, come.

742
00:52:42,025 --> 00:52:44,425
Dad.
- Greetings. - Here.

743
00:52:48,031 --> 00:52:50,329
Hello.
- Come.

744
00:52:50,533 --> 00:52:53,127
Ask them to sit in
the boardroom. Hold on.

745
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:55,668
Greetings.
- He is Andy.

746
00:52:55,772 --> 00:52:58,172
It's hello, Andy.
- Hello.

747
00:52:59,375 --> 00:53:00,535
Is this his house?

748
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:03,403
Take a look around, Father.
- Come.

749
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:05,981
Please, go on, take a look.

750
00:53:13,423 --> 00:53:14,481
This is the gym.

751
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:18,650
There's a cinema
hall inside the house?

752
00:53:18,728 --> 00:53:22,027
Cinema! It's a big
screen television, Dad.

753
00:53:22,131 --> 00:53:23,223
Television.

754
00:53:24,133 --> 00:53:25,191
That's the bedroom.

755
00:53:25,301 --> 00:53:27,132
And you have the
full view of the sea.

756
00:53:28,004 --> 00:53:29,562
Amazing! But whose house is it?

757
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:31,738
I'll tell that later to you.
- Come on.

758
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:35,068
This way, Dad.

759
00:53:36,012 --> 00:53:37,309
Up ahead, there's a...

760
00:53:39,015 --> 00:53:41,279
What's wrong, Dad?
- It's a glass bridge.

761
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:44,319
It's absolutely fine, Dad.

762
00:53:45,355 --> 00:53:46,413
Come on.

763
00:53:49,025 --> 00:53:50,083
What are you doing?

764
00:53:53,062 --> 00:53:54,120
Keep your eyes closed.

765
00:53:54,364 --> 00:53:56,127
What are you doing?
- Careful, Dad.

766
00:53:58,268 --> 00:54:02,534
I want to show you something
you have never seen before.

767
00:54:03,506 --> 00:54:05,474
You can see the whole of Mumbai.

768
00:54:06,309 --> 00:54:09,369
But tell me, whose house is this?

769
00:54:10,246 --> 00:54:12,578
Father, this house
belongs to your son.

770
00:54:12,649 --> 00:54:15,618
Me.
- How much rent do you pay?

771
00:54:15,718 --> 00:54:18,278
Rent?! Dad, I have
bought this place.

772
00:54:18,988 --> 00:54:20,046
You!

773
00:54:22,525 --> 00:54:23,583
My son!

774
00:54:23,693 --> 00:54:26,161
How did you like
your son's new house?

775
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:29,999
Just a minute. That means,
you will stay in Mumbai now.

776
00:54:30,533 --> 00:54:33,001
Dad, Andy feels that I
should stay in Mumbai.

777
00:54:33,336 --> 00:54:34,428
Actually, Uncle...

778
00:54:35,204 --> 00:54:37,195
Sorry, can I call you uncle?

779
00:54:37,473 --> 00:54:39,998
Actually, Uncle, Viju is hot
property for the sponsors.

780
00:54:40,176 --> 00:54:42,644
Shootings, meetings,
participating in events...

781
00:54:42,745 --> 00:54:44,303
And then, cricket practice.

782
00:54:44,414 --> 00:54:46,382
This way, commuting
will be very difficult.

783
00:54:46,549 --> 00:54:47,607
What's so difficult?

784
00:54:47,684 --> 00:54:49,584
All he has to do is catch a flight.

785
00:54:49,686 --> 00:54:51,244
Dad, he'll be tired.

786
00:54:51,354 --> 00:54:52,412
And it will affect the game.

787
00:54:57,126 --> 00:55:01,358
Dad, I was thinking... - I know you
both have a lot of catching up to do.

788
00:55:01,397 --> 00:55:03,194
I'll take your leave.
See you, Uncle.

789
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:05,992
See you, Andy.

790
00:55:08,304 --> 00:55:10,602
Dad, don't go back to Jaisalmer.

791
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:13,032
I'll get your luggage.

792
00:55:16,112 --> 00:55:18,239
What's wrong, Dad?
What are you thinking?

793
00:55:18,381 --> 00:55:24,286
Son, Andy doesn't look me
in the eye while talking.

794
00:55:25,054 --> 00:55:26,112
Is he a good man?

795
00:55:26,589 --> 00:55:29,717
Father, look where
Andy has brought me today.

796
00:55:30,093 --> 00:55:31,390
He's a fantastic businessman.

797
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:35,119
And he treats me just
like a younger brother.

798
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:37,432
Don't get so tense.

799
00:55:38,201 --> 00:55:39,600
I've grown old.

800
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:44,997
And often, people like
us from small towns...

801
00:55:45,074 --> 00:55:50,444
...go astray amidst the glitz
and glamour of big cities.

802
00:55:53,182 --> 00:55:56,117
Dad, I'll never go astray.

803
00:55:57,053 --> 00:56:00,750
And if I do, I know
you'll pull me back.

804
00:56:01,491 --> 00:56:03,118
Look, you have grown old.

805
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:05,092
What nonsense!

806
00:56:05,294 --> 00:56:06,488
Sir, the food has been laid.

807
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:09,096
Someone has sent
something very special for you.

808
00:56:09,165 --> 00:56:10,359
Really! Come on.

809
00:56:12,201 --> 00:56:14,169
Here's red meat.
- Nandini has sent it.

810
00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:15,328
She has made it herself.

811
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,132
Nandu...

812
00:56:18,341 --> 00:56:19,535
That's very delicious.

813
00:56:20,977 --> 00:56:22,035
Nandu...

814
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:29,047
What happened?
- Dad, it's so spicy.

815
00:56:29,585 --> 00:56:30,643
Nandu, I will...

816
00:56:34,524 --> 00:56:38,016
So, your son's tongue was on fire.

817
00:56:38,327 --> 00:56:39,419
You are mad.

818
00:56:39,529 --> 00:56:41,497
So, what was Viju's surprise?

819
00:56:42,598 --> 00:56:43,997
He has bought a huge house.

820
00:56:45,134 --> 00:56:46,294
Worth 250 million.

821
00:56:46,602 --> 00:56:47,626
Why?

822
00:56:48,004 --> 00:56:49,062
Will he rent it out?

823
00:56:50,006 --> 00:56:51,064
No, dear.

824
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:57,643
He will stay in Mumbai now.

825
00:56:58,081 --> 00:57:00,106
He says that he finds
travelling very hectic.

826
00:57:00,216 --> 00:57:01,205
Hello, Father.

827
00:57:01,317 --> 00:57:02,545
Here, talk to him.

828
00:57:02,618 --> 00:57:03,676
Here.
- Nandu.

829
00:57:04,153 --> 00:57:05,552
Hello, Nandu.

830
00:57:06,622 --> 00:57:08,180
I bet I took dad by surprise.

831
00:57:08,958 --> 00:57:10,016
Yes, me too.

832
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:14,088
Congratulations for the
new house, Viju. - Thank you.

833
00:57:14,197 --> 00:57:16,188
I'm getting late. Got to go.

834
00:57:16,299 --> 00:57:17,391
Fine, bye.

835
00:57:18,401 --> 00:57:20,062
Nandu was completely shocked.

836
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:22,594
She would always tease me
calling me the Prince of Jaisalmer.

837
00:57:22,705 --> 00:57:24,366
Prince of Mumbai!

838
00:57:24,507 --> 00:57:27,203
She must be shocked to hear
that the house costs 250 million.

839
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:29,141
By now, she must have told everyone.

840
00:57:29,212 --> 00:57:31,180
Jaisalmer, uncle Laraine...

841
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:36,343
'That day I felt my son had
really become the king of the world.'

842
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:38,580
'But I was scared too.'

843
00:57:39,722 --> 00:57:45,092
'Leaving Viju alone with Andy
in Mumbai was a big mistake.'

844
00:57:45,495 --> 00:57:47,360
Yes, confirmed, Vijay
Shekhawat will be there.

845
00:57:47,497 --> 00:57:48,521
Viju.
- Yes.

846
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:49,723
I've booked a show for tomorrow.

847
00:57:50,032 --> 00:57:51,090
Tomorrow
- Yes.

848
00:57:51,334 --> 00:57:53,029
But my conditioning camps
are starting from tomorrow.

849
00:57:53,336 --> 00:57:54,394
Yes, so don't go.

850
00:57:55,338 --> 00:57:57,636
That's impossible, Andy.
- What?

851
00:57:58,007 --> 00:57:59,065
Impossible.

852
00:58:00,009 --> 00:58:00,998
Do one thing.

853
00:58:01,110 --> 00:58:02,270
Just continue playing cricket.

854
00:58:02,378 --> 00:58:04,972
And just forget about
becoming the richest sportsman.

855
00:58:05,314 --> 00:58:06,941
There's a very subtle difference
between a sport and a game...

856
00:58:07,016 --> 00:58:09,109
...which you will never understand.

857
00:58:09,685 --> 00:58:11,676
Jenny, cancel the lousy show.

858
00:58:15,391 --> 00:58:17,689
Hey, can you send us
some drinks please?

859
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:21,191
Stop!

860
00:58:21,497 --> 00:58:24,955
Andy, they are using makeup
and clips on me. I am not a girl.

861
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:26,059
I am a cricketer.

862
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:28,628
Stop.

863
00:58:29,338 --> 00:58:30,396
Come on, Vijay.

864
00:58:30,506 --> 00:58:31,564
They are paying you 10 million.

865
00:58:31,641 --> 00:58:34,007
For 10 million, I
can do a striptease.

866
00:58:34,110 --> 00:58:36,237
Oh, Sweetheart!

867
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:39,072
Vijay!

868
00:58:58,501 --> 00:59:01,265
"Money! Money!"

869
00:59:01,337 --> 00:59:03,100
Your match is about to start!

870
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:04,264
Very sorry, sir!

871
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:06,501
"Money! Money!"

872
00:59:06,609 --> 00:59:10,238
"Show me the money
and take the honey."

873
00:59:10,379 --> 00:59:14,008
"Show me the money
and take the honey."

874
00:59:14,083 --> 00:59:15,311
"Money! Money!"

875
00:59:15,418 --> 00:59:16,510
There's an ad-film shoot tomorrow.

876
00:59:17,019 --> 00:59:18,646
Tomorrow!
- Yes. - Tomorrow is my match.

877
00:59:19,021 --> 00:59:20,386
This is my year, remember.

878
00:59:20,456 --> 00:59:22,014
"Money. Money."

879
00:59:24,293 --> 00:59:25,658
They're all good. Pack all five.

880
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:27,188
Are you mad, Andy?
- Come on.

881
00:59:28,764 --> 00:59:30,129
"The one that lives life."

882
00:59:30,666 --> 00:59:32,133
"The one that can live with ease."

883
00:59:32,635 --> 00:59:36,036
"That can cash-in in the world."

884
00:59:36,539 --> 00:59:38,302
"Don't be shy."

885
00:59:38,441 --> 00:59:40,204
"You can commit any sin..."

886
00:59:40,409 --> 00:59:42,036
"...whether there's
a tomorrow or not."

887
00:59:42,111 --> 00:59:43,772
"Do as you please."

888
00:59:44,313 --> 00:59:46,338
"Pick up the glass,
bring it near your lips."

889
00:59:46,449 --> 00:59:48,246
"Indulge yourself in everything."

890
00:59:48,417 --> 00:59:52,319
"It will change... Your
fate has to change."

891
00:59:55,558 --> 00:59:59,426
"Heaven! Heaven!"

892
00:59:59,495 --> 01:00:01,224
"Come, let me show you heaven!"

893
01:00:01,330 --> 01:00:04,993
"Heaven! Heaven!"

894
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:08,229
"Money! Money!"

895
01:00:08,304 --> 01:00:11,273
"Money! Money!"

896
01:00:26,355 --> 01:00:31,019
"Money! Money!"

897
01:00:31,093 --> 01:00:34,187
"Money! Money!"

898
01:00:34,297 --> 01:00:38,256
When success and stardom comes
with ease, it messes up the mind.

899
01:00:38,534 --> 01:00:43,562
So, this is our cricket star
Vijay Shekhawat and his lifestyle.

900
01:00:44,774 --> 01:00:47,368
Hello, Father. - Son, what
is this that I am watching?

901
01:00:47,443 --> 01:00:48,774
I'll call you later.
I am sleeping now.

902
01:00:49,445 --> 01:00:50,503
Hello.

903
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:53,248
"Life is like a poison."

904
01:00:53,382 --> 01:00:55,179
"Life is like a dream."

905
01:00:55,284 --> 01:00:57,047
"Live your life as you please."

906
01:00:57,119 --> 01:00:58,609
"Heaven."

907
01:00:58,721 --> 01:01:00,712
"Life is lust and life is special."

908
01:01:00,790 --> 01:01:02,621
"Life is beautiful,
have temptation!"

909
01:01:02,692 --> 01:01:05,422
"Life is full of sensation."

910
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:08,327
"Why live a simple life?"

911
01:01:08,431 --> 01:01:10,296
"Live life on the edge."

912
01:01:10,399 --> 01:01:12,128
"Let the drinks flow."

913
01:01:12,234 --> 01:01:13,701
"Heaven."

914
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:17,530
"It will change... Your
fate has to change."

915
01:01:21,444 --> 01:01:25,005
"Heaven! Heaven!"

916
01:01:25,114 --> 01:01:26,638
Vijay Shekhawat
scores another century.

917
01:01:26,716 --> 01:01:28,581
The man of the match award
goes to Vijay Shekhawat.

918
01:01:28,684 --> 01:01:30,743
There are many cricketers.
- But there's only one star.

919
01:01:31,053 --> 01:01:33,283
Vijay.
- Andy. Deal! 10 crore!

920
01:01:33,389 --> 01:01:37,018
Go, Vijay go!

921
01:02:04,253 --> 01:02:05,720
"The one that lives life."

922
01:02:06,022 --> 01:02:07,512
"The one who can live with ease."

923
01:02:07,723 --> 01:02:11,181
"Who can cash-in in the world."

924
01:02:11,293 --> 01:02:13,090
"I own the world."

925
01:02:13,295 --> 01:02:14,626
"I have the right to fame."

926
01:02:14,730 --> 01:02:18,530
"I live as I please."

927
01:02:18,634 --> 01:02:20,295
"Go out there."

928
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:22,268
"Show it to the world
what you are made of."

929
01:02:22,371 --> 01:02:25,340
"Yes, that's your heaven."

930
01:02:25,408 --> 01:02:26,466
Vijay, have you seen the time?

931
01:02:26,575 --> 01:02:27,633
I'll have to report you.

932
01:02:27,743 --> 01:02:31,372
Write this in your report. The
world salutes Vijay Shekhawat.

933
01:02:31,447 --> 01:02:34,041
"Heaven! Heaven!"

934
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:35,412
No one has begun in the game, Vijay.

935
01:02:35,484 --> 01:02:38,009
"Heaven! Heaven!"

936
01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:42,114
"Come, let me show heaven to you."

937
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:46,126
Vijay Shekhawat, he
lived life king-size.

938
01:02:46,629 --> 01:02:52,534
"Heaven! Heaven!"

939
01:02:53,536 --> 01:02:54,594
"Heaven!"

940
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:00,500
Go! Go.

941
01:03:00,643 --> 01:03:03,578
Stop!

942
01:03:03,646 --> 01:03:05,136
Come on out.

943
01:03:05,981 --> 01:03:07,039
Come out, Viju.

944
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:13,647
Come.
- Viju.

945
01:03:13,989 --> 01:03:16,480
I said that I'll make you a star.

946
01:03:16,592 --> 01:03:19,220
Star!
- Prince!

947
01:03:19,328 --> 01:03:20,488
Here's your kingdom.

948
01:03:20,996 --> 01:03:22,520
Look!

949
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:25,699
You are everywhere.

950
01:03:26,001 --> 01:03:27,025
Just you!

951
01:03:27,103 --> 01:03:28,195
Just you, my friend.

952
01:03:30,673 --> 01:03:33,733
Andy! I love you, Andy.
- Vijay Shekhawat, big star.

953
01:03:34,009 --> 01:03:35,533
Yes.

954
01:03:45,020 --> 01:03:47,750
Yes, Viju.
- Nandu, were you sleeping?

955
01:03:48,357 --> 01:03:49,551
Yes.
- Then get up.

956
01:03:50,126 --> 01:03:54,028
You always said that
God is everywhere.

957
01:03:54,763 --> 01:04:01,032
But from the place where I'm
standing, all I can see is me.

958
01:04:02,571 --> 01:04:04,471
God is nowhere to be seen.

959
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:06,541
Viju, are you drunk?

960
01:04:06,642 --> 01:04:10,203
Yes!
- God Vijay Shekhawat!

961
01:04:10,412 --> 01:04:11,470
Look, Nandu!

962
01:04:11,547 --> 01:04:12,605
Look what Andy is saying.

963
01:04:13,249 --> 01:04:15,342
He's saying, "God Vijay Shekhawat."

964
01:04:15,718 --> 01:04:17,310
God Vijay Shekhawat.

965
01:04:17,386 --> 01:04:18,546
I am God!

966
01:04:18,621 --> 01:04:20,213
Vijay Shekhawat is God.

967
01:04:20,322 --> 01:04:22,290
I am God! Finish!

968
01:04:33,202 --> 01:04:35,261
Vijay Shekhawat is ready.
Fernando bowls...

969
01:04:36,672 --> 01:04:38,105
Clean bowled.

970
01:04:39,108 --> 01:04:41,008
For the first time in his career...

971
01:04:41,076 --> 01:04:42,270
...Vijay has been
clean bowled for a duck.

972
01:04:42,444 --> 01:04:45,311
No one can believe it.

973
01:04:45,414 --> 01:04:47,405
Vijay Shekhawat is
looking towards the stump.

974
01:04:47,483 --> 01:04:49,110
He can't believe it either.

975
01:04:49,251 --> 01:04:52,015
Atul, it was apparent
from his lifestyle...

976
01:04:52,087 --> 01:04:56,490
...that for the past many months,
he's not concentrating on his game.

977
01:04:59,094 --> 01:05:01,358
You're here.

978
01:05:01,397 --> 01:05:02,489
Where are you going?

979
01:05:02,598 --> 01:05:05,499
I am going to the nets.
- Why? Don't go to the nets.

980
01:05:05,601 --> 01:05:08,001
No! - Hello... - Come on.
Please. - Andy! - Come on.

981
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:10,061
Andy, I have to practice.
- Come on, baby.

982
01:05:13,475 --> 01:05:14,965
Chaminda Vaas to Shekhawat.

983
01:05:27,056 --> 01:05:29,718
Prince, don't you
want to play the match?

984
01:05:32,127 --> 01:05:34,118
I can play the match blindfolded.

985
01:05:40,202 --> 01:05:43,330
It is turning to be a
nightmare of a series for Shekhawat.

986
01:05:43,672 --> 01:05:45,663
What's happening to Vijay Shekhawat?

987
01:05:45,741 --> 01:05:49,336
Relax, madam. Even the
moon changes its shape.

988
01:05:49,411 --> 01:05:51,572
Even the sun gets eclipsed.

989
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:54,342
But it doesn't stay for long.

990
01:05:54,450 --> 01:05:57,010
He missed it completely.
And that's a stump-out.

991
01:05:58,020 --> 01:05:59,749
He's caught.

992
01:06:06,695 --> 01:06:07,957
Hello, Dad.

993
01:06:07,997 --> 01:06:10,158
Son, you got out for a zero again.

994
01:06:10,499 --> 01:06:11,557
Weren't you playing with interest?

995
01:06:12,968 --> 01:06:13,992
Excuse me.

996
01:06:15,070 --> 01:06:17,004
Father, you forget.

997
01:06:17,339 --> 01:06:18,499
I play for team India.

998
01:06:18,607 --> 01:06:19,699
And not for the local club.

999
01:06:20,042 --> 01:06:21,407
I know when to give my best.

1000
01:06:21,577 --> 01:06:23,977
Now... Dad, Andy is
trying to call me.

1001
01:06:24,046 --> 01:06:25,104
I'll call you later.

1002
01:06:38,327 --> 01:06:41,490
Once more!
- Hey, Take a walk, man.

1003
01:06:43,132 --> 01:06:44,224
One good game!

1004
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:47,325
One good game! And Vijay
will be back with a bang.

1005
01:06:54,576 --> 01:06:55,736
Clean bowled!

1006
01:06:57,212 --> 01:06:58,577
Bowled.

1007
01:06:58,681 --> 01:07:01,980
Oh, this is sad.

1008
01:07:02,551 --> 01:07:03,609
I'm not hungry.

1009
01:07:05,954 --> 01:07:07,012
Uncle...

1010
01:07:09,291 --> 01:07:11,953
Our question was, did Vijay
Shekhawat's leisurely lifestyle...

1011
01:07:12,027 --> 01:07:14,188
...have any affect on his game?

1012
01:07:14,363 --> 01:07:17,491
3.5% audiences say yes.

1013
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:20,500
So Mr. Vijay Shekhawat...
you take care...

1014
01:07:21,136 --> 01:07:22,296
Why are you
listening to their nonsense?

1015
01:07:23,272 --> 01:07:24,330
They can't do
anything on their own...

1016
01:07:24,406 --> 01:07:25,464
...and are always jealous of others.

1017
01:07:26,241 --> 01:07:27,708
They say that your
career is on a downfall.

1018
01:07:27,976 --> 01:07:29,034
How can that be?

1019
01:07:29,645 --> 01:07:32,546
We have signed
contracts worth 200 million.

1020
01:07:33,315 --> 01:07:34,373
Wow!

1021
01:07:36,218 --> 01:07:38,311
Father.
- Hello, Dad. - Hello.

1022
01:07:39,321 --> 01:07:41,255
So, that's what you
have been teaching my son.

1023
01:07:42,524 --> 01:07:44,048
Get out of here.
- Now.

1024
01:07:44,126 --> 01:07:46,219
Get out of here right now.
- What do you mean?

1025
01:07:46,328 --> 01:07:48,296
What?
- Father, what's wrong with you?

1026
01:07:48,397 --> 01:07:49,421
What's wrong with you?

1027
01:07:50,032 --> 01:07:53,593
Don't you see that he's ruining
your game for the sake of money?

1028
01:07:54,103 --> 01:07:55,730
You are talking just like
those people on television.

1029
01:07:57,039 --> 01:07:59,007
Just because I faired
badly in a few games...

1030
01:07:59,074 --> 01:08:00,735
...everyone has been
labeling me as a failure.

1031
01:08:01,610 --> 01:08:05,944
Father, those who still trust me
are ready to invest millions in me.

1032
01:08:06,048 --> 01:08:07,106
You are saying this.

1033
01:08:08,016 --> 01:08:09,984
Ever since childhood,
you've had only one dream.

1034
01:08:10,285 --> 01:08:11,582
That is, to play for India.

1035
01:08:12,020 --> 01:08:13,954
Was it only to make money?

1036
01:08:14,022 --> 01:08:15,455
Why do you hate money, Father?

1037
01:08:15,591 --> 01:08:18,219
Because money has
ruined my son's life.

1038
01:08:18,694 --> 01:08:20,559
Pack your bags and
come with me to Jaisalmer.

1039
01:08:20,629 --> 01:08:21,687
Jaisalmer.

1040
01:08:22,164 --> 01:08:25,463
You want to take me back to
the desert that I left behind.

1041
01:08:25,601 --> 01:08:27,091
I have everything over here.

1042
01:08:27,202 --> 01:08:28,294
What's there in Jaisalmer?

1043
01:08:28,504 --> 01:08:31,701
This is not you. These
are Andy's thoughts.

1044
01:08:31,974 --> 01:08:33,532
What do you have against Andy?

1045
01:08:34,042 --> 01:08:36,135
Andy has fulfilled all my dreams.

1046
01:08:36,645 --> 01:08:40,706
Today, I have enough money
to buy anything that I desire.

1047
01:08:41,650 --> 01:08:42,981
If you can give me
all these things...

1048
01:08:43,051 --> 01:08:44,985
...then I'm ready to come
to Jaisalmer with you.

1049
01:08:47,523 --> 01:08:54,725
No, Son. Your poor father
can't give you what Andy Singh did.

1050
01:08:58,600 --> 01:08:59,624
Where are you going?

1051
01:09:01,003 --> 01:09:02,163
Where are you going, Father?

1052
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:07,665
You are very rich. Isn't it, Son?

1053
01:09:09,344 --> 01:09:13,542
Find yourself a new
father with that money.

1054
01:09:20,689 --> 01:09:21,747
Dad!

1055
01:09:22,758 --> 01:09:28,458
Dad! Leave.

1056
01:09:28,564 --> 01:09:31,556
Leave! Everyone just leave!

1057
01:09:55,724 --> 01:09:57,453
'I have everything
over here, Father.'

1058
01:09:57,559 --> 01:09:59,049
'What's there in Jaisalmer? '

1059
01:09:59,394 --> 01:10:04,195
'Today, I have enough money to
buy anything that I desire.'

1060
01:10:05,701 --> 01:10:06,998
'If you can give me
all these things... '

1061
01:10:07,035 --> 01:10:10,095
...then I'm ready to come
to Jaisalmer with you.'

1062
01:10:10,205 --> 01:10:12,139
'What's there in Jaisalmer? '

1063
01:10:19,214 --> 01:10:20,306
Yes, Nandu.

1064
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:21,609
Uncle, how are you?

1065
01:10:21,683 --> 01:10:22,741
Where are you?

1066
01:10:24,353 --> 01:10:25,411
I don't know.

1067
01:10:26,688 --> 01:10:29,122
You don't know?
- Are you crying, Uncle?

1068
01:10:42,638 --> 01:10:43,696
Yes, Nandu.

1069
01:10:43,772 --> 01:10:45,763
I've never come across a
selfish person such as you.

1070
01:10:46,275 --> 01:10:49,506
You know, uncle is
wandering on the streets, crying.

1071
01:10:50,245 --> 01:10:52,338
You should be ashamed of yourself.

1072
01:10:52,514 --> 01:10:53,572
Nandu, don't talk nonsense.

1073
01:10:53,649 --> 01:10:54,707
You don't know anything.

1074
01:10:54,783 --> 01:10:57,513
I didn't start it.
- Keep quiet, Viju.

1075
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:01,052
I'm ashamed to call you my friend.

1076
01:11:20,208 --> 01:11:21,300
Go to hell, all of you!

1077
01:11:25,641 --> 01:11:27,302
Vijay Shekhawat has faded away.

1078
01:11:29,178 --> 01:11:31,646
Vijay Shekhawat
will never fade away.

1079
01:11:35,251 --> 01:11:36,650
What's the speed?
- 100!

1080
01:11:36,719 --> 01:11:39,711
Increase it to 120! - But sir,
you haven't worn the pads.

1081
01:11:40,256 --> 01:11:41,382
130!
- But sir...

1082
01:11:43,192 --> 01:11:44,250
140!

1083
01:11:55,237 --> 01:11:57,933
Sir, what's wrong?
Sir! Are you all right?

1084
01:12:06,215 --> 01:12:07,477
Vijay.
- Yes.

1085
01:12:08,484 --> 01:12:11,885
You have what we call a
herniated disc between L4 and L5.

1086
01:12:12,354 --> 01:12:14,413
Can you please say
that in simple terms?

1087
01:12:15,624 --> 01:12:18,218
I mean, you had an
old spine injury...

1088
01:12:18,294 --> 01:12:19,955
...that got aggravated today.

1089
01:12:21,630 --> 01:12:24,895
So, is it serious?
- Well, nothing to worry about.

1090
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:26,394
So, I can play cricket.

1091
01:12:26,502 --> 01:12:29,403
No cricket for four-five months.

1092
01:12:30,639 --> 01:12:31,765
And complete bed rest.

1093
01:12:32,574 --> 01:12:34,303
I'll prescribe you
some pain killers.

1094
01:12:34,777 --> 01:12:35,835
That should help.

1095
01:12:42,384 --> 01:12:45,444
Andy, inform my
coach about the injury.

1096
01:12:45,587 --> 01:12:47,248
And then, they'll
throw you out of the team.

1097
01:12:48,524 --> 01:12:50,924
Your performance has been
poor in the last two series.

1098
01:12:51,193 --> 01:12:53,320
All they need is a chance to
throw you out of the team.

1099
01:12:53,395 --> 01:12:54,589
Andy, you are over-reacting.

1100
01:12:54,930 --> 01:12:56,261
I've been asked to take rest.

1101
01:12:56,332 --> 01:12:57,390
It's just a question of few weeks.

1102
01:12:57,433 --> 01:12:58,525
Few weeks.

1103
01:12:58,834 --> 01:13:01,598
In cricket, a few weeks
can change everything.

1104
01:13:01,804 --> 01:13:04,466
The board will get
another player in your place.

1105
01:13:04,606 --> 01:13:06,198
And if that player plays well...

1106
01:13:06,275 --> 01:13:08,937
...you will lose you
position in the team.

1107
01:13:09,278 --> 01:13:10,939
And then you may go
back to Jaisalmer.

1108
01:13:11,213 --> 01:13:13,807
You are talking nonsense, Andy.
- Nonsense!

1109
01:13:14,483 --> 01:13:16,747
How many years did it take you
to get into the Indian team?

1110
01:13:16,819 --> 01:13:17,877
Seven years.

1111
01:13:18,287 --> 01:13:22,223
And now, wait for another
seven to get back into the team.

1112
01:13:23,225 --> 01:13:25,750
You'll lose the house,
the car, everything.

1113
01:13:25,828 --> 01:13:26,886
Everything.

1114
01:13:26,962 --> 01:13:28,156
All the contracts
will be cancelled...

1115
01:13:28,230 --> 01:13:30,289
...and the sponsors
will ask for their money.

1116
01:13:30,399 --> 01:13:32,162
Because every contract states that...

1117
01:13:32,201 --> 01:13:37,503
...it's valid until Vijay
Shekhawat plays for team India.

1118
01:13:37,573 --> 01:13:39,700
Now, the decision is in your hands.

1119
01:13:40,576 --> 01:13:43,636
This is going to be
one of the tough series.

1120
01:13:43,712 --> 01:13:45,441
It is not the game
that happened last time.

1121
01:13:47,783 --> 01:13:51,651
But remember, Dino, last time Vijay
Shekhawat was really in a good form.

1122
01:13:51,787 --> 01:13:53,254
Sure, he was, but at the moment,
he is failing.

1123
01:13:53,322 --> 01:13:55,256
He's failed against England...

1124
01:13:55,391 --> 01:13:57,586
...he's failed against the Australians
and against the Sri Lankan's.

1125
01:13:57,726 --> 01:14:00,320
Now, he has to put up and perform.

1126
01:14:13,208 --> 01:14:15,733
A big shot, it is in the air
and the player catches it.

1127
01:14:18,414 --> 01:14:20,541
Vijay, what are you doing?

1128
01:14:21,750 --> 01:14:22,808
Are you okay?

1129
01:14:23,285 --> 01:14:24,547
I'm absolutely fine, Coach.

1130
01:14:24,686 --> 01:14:28,679
I felt you were a bit
uncomfortable in yesterday's match.

1131
01:14:28,757 --> 01:14:30,224
I hope you are okay.

1132
01:14:31,226 --> 01:14:33,421
It was just a slight muscle strain.

1133
01:14:33,495 --> 01:14:34,553
I'm absolutely fine.

1134
01:14:56,585 --> 01:14:58,712
Cannot believe it.
Cannot believe it.

1135
01:15:00,189 --> 01:15:02,851
Vijay Shekhawat has been failing
for the last 20 consecutive matches.

1136
01:15:03,258 --> 01:15:04,850
Do you still believe in him?

1137
01:15:05,594 --> 01:15:06,652
Of course.

1138
01:15:06,728 --> 01:15:07,786
Absolutely.

1139
01:15:07,863 --> 01:15:09,854
As you know, form is temporary.

1140
01:15:10,199 --> 01:15:11,723
But class is permanent.

1141
01:15:12,401 --> 01:15:16,895
And I believe that Vijay
Shekhawat will come back with a bang.

1142
01:15:41,697 --> 01:15:42,755
Hello.

1143
01:15:42,831 --> 01:15:43,889
Dad.

1144
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:51,430
I wanted to hear your voice. - I'm
sorry. You dialled the wrong number.

1145
01:15:52,441 --> 01:15:56,172
This is not Andy Singh's number.

1146
01:16:01,917 --> 01:16:03,179
Dad...

1147
01:16:09,658 --> 01:16:12,923
His injury has worsened.

1148
01:16:13,729 --> 01:16:16,789
I guess, we'll have
to perform a surgery.

1149
01:16:16,832 --> 01:16:18,322
Little complicated but...

1150
01:16:19,735 --> 01:16:24,468
Nirav, don't tell
Vijay about the surgery.

1151
01:16:24,673 --> 01:16:26,197
I'll have to tell him sometime.

1152
01:16:26,275 --> 01:16:27,333
Let me take care of this.

1153
01:16:29,211 --> 01:16:30,735
Nothing to worry, Prince.

1154
01:16:30,879 --> 01:16:33,404
Nirav will show you how
to inject the pain killer.

1155
01:16:33,682 --> 01:16:34,740
You'll manage.

1156
01:16:35,551 --> 01:16:38,884
Andy, it's very easy
for you to say that.

1157
01:16:41,290 --> 01:16:42,484
I am the one enduring the pain.

1158
01:16:44,293 --> 01:16:45,419
I am lying to the coach.

1159
01:16:45,494 --> 01:16:47,894
Come on, Prince. It's just a
matter of one more series.

1160
01:16:48,430 --> 01:16:51,593
You have endured so much.
Then why not some more?

1161
01:16:52,568 --> 01:16:55,401
And soon, you will be rocking.

1162
01:16:55,571 --> 01:16:56,731
You are my tiger.

1163
01:16:56,805 --> 01:16:58,705
The match between India-Pakistan
is a four match series.

1164
01:16:58,774 --> 01:17:01,174
All eyes on Vijay Shekhawat
who has been unable to perform...

1165
01:17:01,243 --> 01:17:02,505
...for the last three series.

1166
01:17:02,711 --> 01:17:04,702
Will he perform a
miracle in this series?

1167
01:17:04,913 --> 01:17:06,380
There's a lot of pressure building.

1168
01:17:06,515 --> 01:17:08,574
Sohail bowls. An appeal for LBW.

1169
01:17:08,650 --> 01:17:10,515
And Vijay Shekhawat is out.

1170
01:17:11,587 --> 01:17:17,389
Oh, no! Oh, no!

1171
01:17:17,659 --> 01:17:20,184
Second match,
Shoaib Malik is bowling.

1172
01:17:20,329 --> 01:17:22,729
That's a bad shot.

1173
01:17:22,864 --> 01:17:24,559
How is he playing?

1174
01:17:24,666 --> 01:17:26,566
And he has been stumped.
- Throw him out of the team!

1175
01:17:27,436 --> 01:17:29,131
Rao Iftekar is ready to bowl.

1176
01:17:29,171 --> 01:17:30,263
And that's clean bowled!

1177
01:17:30,339 --> 01:17:31,397
Vijay Shekhawat fails again.

1178
01:17:31,473 --> 01:17:33,407
Has Vijay Shekhawat lost his game?

1179
01:17:33,475 --> 01:17:35,409
Has his career reached a dead end?

1180
01:17:35,544 --> 01:17:37,671
There are many such questions
that don't have any answers.

1181
01:17:37,746 --> 01:17:39,611
The question is, is
Vijay Shekhawat's bad...

1182
01:17:39,681 --> 01:17:41,672
...form temporary or is it permanent?

1183
01:17:42,351 --> 01:17:44,546
Viju...
- Coach.

1184
01:17:44,686 --> 01:17:46,153
Tomorrow's match is
a do or die match.

1185
01:17:46,221 --> 01:17:48,815
If we lose this one,
we lose the series.

1186
01:17:50,292 --> 01:17:53,227
I'm being pressurised to
replace you with someone else.

1187
01:17:53,295 --> 01:17:56,423
But I'm supporting you completely.

1188
01:17:56,765 --> 01:17:57,891
Because I trust you.

1189
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:00,161
The last match of this series.

1190
01:18:00,202 --> 01:18:02,864
And every Indian wants
India to win this match.

1191
01:18:03,171 --> 01:18:06,231
As you all know, India is
trailing behind by 2-1 in this series.

1192
01:18:06,308 --> 01:18:09,709
But the good news for the fans is
that Vijay Shekhawat is back in form.

1193
01:18:09,778 --> 01:18:11,439
Vijay seems to be on
fire with the bat.

1194
01:18:11,780 --> 01:18:13,907
And another splendid six!

1195
01:18:14,182 --> 01:18:15,513
He has hit that on square-leg.

1196
01:18:15,584 --> 01:18:20,248
And his body language
shows that he is back in form.

1197
01:18:20,656 --> 01:18:23,181
And he has found a small
gap in between the fielders.

1198
01:18:25,193 --> 01:18:27,718
But we can see that
Vijay is getting a bit tired.

1199
01:18:27,796 --> 01:18:29,127
Vijay! Vijay!

1200
01:18:29,197 --> 01:18:31,256
That's wonderful footwork.

1201
01:18:31,333 --> 01:18:33,426
That's a brilliant six!
Exactly at the centre of the bat.

1202
01:18:33,535 --> 01:18:35,162
Shoaib Malik is an
experienced bowler.

1203
01:18:35,237 --> 01:18:38,673
But he seems completely helpless
in front of Vijay's form today.

1204
01:18:39,808 --> 01:18:41,673
And he has found room
between the off stump!

1205
01:18:42,144 --> 01:18:45,204
And he has lifted
it for another six.

1206
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:47,145
There! He has hit it again.

1207
01:18:47,215 --> 01:18:49,206
Viju! Viju!

1208
01:18:54,222 --> 01:18:56,417
He has picked it up
again at the long-off.

1209
01:18:57,426 --> 01:18:58,757
He has been
whacking all the bowlers.

1210
01:18:58,827 --> 01:19:01,159
And looking at the way
he's batting today...

1211
01:19:01,229 --> 01:19:03,697
...I have a feeling, he'll
get India back into the series.

1212
01:19:03,765 --> 01:19:05,164
Absolutely, he hasn't given any
fielder a chance to do anything...

1213
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:06,394
...whenever he's played a shot.

1214
01:19:06,501 --> 01:19:08,162
But if you look at the way...

1215
01:19:08,203 --> 01:19:10,171
...he's stretching himself...

1216
01:19:10,238 --> 01:19:11,364
...he seems to be having
some kind of a back problem.

1217
01:19:14,509 --> 01:19:16,170
He has played the ball towards
the square-leg...

1218
01:19:16,244 --> 01:19:18,178
...with the help of his wrist.

1219
01:19:18,246 --> 01:19:23,183
He has completed the first run
quickly. Wants to take another one.

1220
01:19:24,319 --> 01:19:26,514
This can prove dangerous for him.

1221
01:19:26,588 --> 01:19:27,646
From the way he's running...

1222
01:19:27,723 --> 01:19:29,122
...he seems to be facing
some kind of physical problem.

1223
01:19:29,191 --> 01:19:31,125
He's not putting in any effort.

1224
01:19:31,193 --> 01:19:34,128
He could have been safe,
had he dived for it.

1225
01:19:34,196 --> 01:19:36,664
He could have reached the crease.

1226
01:19:36,732 --> 01:19:38,131
And that's a very
big setback for India...

1227
01:19:38,166 --> 01:19:42,125
...because if you notice the
Pakistani players' body language...

1228
01:19:42,170 --> 01:19:46,129
...it seems as though they have
taken the most important wicket...

1229
01:19:46,208 --> 01:19:49,735
...and have won the match.

1230
01:19:49,878 --> 01:19:52,142
Absolutely, the body language
of the Pakistanis show that...

1231
01:19:52,214 --> 01:19:55,149
...the match is
completely under their control.

1232
01:19:55,217 --> 01:19:57,151
Vijay Shekhawat has
disappointed his team...

1233
01:19:57,219 --> 01:19:59,346
...his supporters and
his fans once again.

1234
01:19:59,421 --> 01:20:01,355
He was run out by just six inches.

1235
01:20:09,297 --> 01:20:11,162
Atul, the way he's
holding his back...

1236
01:20:11,199 --> 01:20:13,258
...it clearly indicates that he's
experiencing some fitness problem.

1237
01:20:13,368 --> 01:20:15,165
India has lost this
series to Pakistan...

1238
01:20:15,203 --> 01:20:18,366
...due to Vijay
Shekhawat's careless innings.

1239
01:20:18,774 --> 01:20:20,503
There's no place for
Vijay in this team.

1240
01:20:21,376 --> 01:20:23,844
No more Vijay Shekhawat.

1241
01:20:24,179 --> 01:20:27,239
You have broken India's heart.

1242
01:20:27,582 --> 01:20:30,380
The Lord speaks through the masses.

1243
01:20:30,452 --> 01:20:36,584
And that voice is saying,
Vijay Shekhawat, you have to go.

1244
01:20:38,393 --> 01:20:39,451
You tell them to wait.

1245
01:20:39,528 --> 01:20:40,586
I'll be there soon.

1246
01:20:40,662 --> 01:20:41,720
What's the matter, Vijay?

1247
01:20:41,797 --> 01:20:42,855
Why did you call
me here so urgently?

1248
01:20:43,865 --> 01:20:45,162
This is a holy place for me.

1249
01:20:46,168 --> 01:20:47,726
And I have sinned here.

1250
01:20:48,437 --> 01:20:49,768
So, why are you so upset?

1251
01:20:50,205 --> 01:20:51,331
The season is over.

1252
01:20:51,406 --> 01:20:52,805
Let's get the treatment done.

1253
01:20:53,608 --> 01:20:55,132
Whenever I close my eyes...

1254
01:20:55,210 --> 01:20:58,202
...I can see the faces of
those to whom I have lied.

1255
01:20:59,548 --> 01:21:00,606
I cannot sleep.

1256
01:21:01,550 --> 01:21:03,541
Take some sleeping pills.

1257
01:21:03,685 --> 01:21:04,743
Come on.

1258
01:21:05,554 --> 01:21:06,680
I'm going to tell the coach.

1259
01:21:07,823 --> 01:21:09,552
Have you gone mad?

1260
01:21:09,758 --> 01:21:10,884
Andy, I have made a mistake.

1261
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:13,425
And I will have to make up for it.

1262
01:21:13,562 --> 01:21:15,553
You... Make up...

1263
01:21:15,697 --> 01:21:18,165
You will be ruined
and take me with you.

1264
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:20,595
I have invested a
lot of money in you.

1265
01:21:20,669 --> 01:21:22,261
I can't let you throw
away all that money.

1266
01:21:22,370 --> 01:21:23,632
Stop it, Andy.

1267
01:21:24,239 --> 01:21:28,835
I have betrayed my team, my
country and my father for this money.

1268
01:21:29,177 --> 01:21:31,771
To hell with your team,
your country and your father!

1269
01:21:31,847 --> 01:21:33,712
To hell with you, Andy!

1270
01:21:35,517 --> 01:21:37,246
Prince, listen to me.

1271
01:21:37,319 --> 01:21:38,377
Don't go.

1272
01:21:47,262 --> 01:21:49,321
Coach, did you get my message?

1273
01:21:53,835 --> 01:21:54,893
Coach, I...

1274
01:21:55,437 --> 01:21:58,201
I'm ashamed to say
that I'm the manager...

1275
01:21:58,273 --> 01:22:00,605
...of a treacherous
player like Vijay Shekhawat.

1276
01:22:02,677 --> 01:22:07,205
Three months ago, Dr. Nirav
Shah advised Vijay Shekhawat...

1277
01:22:07,282 --> 01:22:09,546
...to get his back operated.

1278
01:22:12,287 --> 01:22:13,345
Here.

1279
01:22:13,421 --> 01:22:14,479
Coach, I was about to tell you...

1280
01:22:15,557 --> 01:22:20,221
But Vijay Shekhawat hid this truth
from the cricket board, his coach...

1281
01:22:20,295 --> 01:22:21,489
...and kept playing cricket.

1282
01:22:21,963 --> 01:22:25,558
He hid this truth from
me too. From his manager.

1283
01:22:26,601 --> 01:22:31,629
Due to his injury, our team had
to face defeat in many matches.

1284
01:22:32,307 --> 01:22:35,765
He betrayed everyone
for the sake of money.

1285
01:22:37,312 --> 01:22:42,181
As an Indian, it's my duty to let
everyone know about this truth...

1286
01:22:42,250 --> 01:22:47,187
...so that strict action is
taken against disloyal players...

1287
01:22:47,255 --> 01:22:49,189
...like Vijay Shekhawat.

1288
01:22:49,257 --> 01:22:50,781
You should trash this idiot!

1289
01:22:51,326 --> 01:22:55,194
Coach, I wanted to...
- Quiet.

1290
01:23:00,802 --> 01:23:01,826
Uncle!

1291
01:23:03,338 --> 01:23:04,396
Uncle!

1292
01:23:17,686 --> 01:23:18,744
Ram Singh is completely shocked.

1293
01:23:18,820 --> 01:23:20,811
'Viju has killed my soul.'

1294
01:23:20,889 --> 01:23:21,947
Vedpal!

1295
01:23:22,357 --> 01:23:25,155
'The crowd just lit the pyre... '

1296
01:23:25,226 --> 01:23:28,161
'... of my dreams, of my pride... '

1297
01:23:28,229 --> 01:23:36,193
'... and everything that I
earned honestly in my life.'

1298
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:37,156
'Father, I give you the credit
for every run off my bat and... '

1299
01:24:37,198 --> 01:24:39,496
'... every moment spent on the pitch.'

1300
01:24:44,839 --> 01:24:49,173
Uncle! Uncle! Uncle!

1301
01:24:49,778 --> 01:24:51,712
Father! Father!

1302
01:24:52,313 --> 01:24:53,371
Mr. Shekhawat!

1303
01:24:53,581 --> 01:24:55,242
Mr. Shekhawat, open the door.

1304
01:24:55,383 --> 01:24:57,248
There's news for you from Jaisalmer.

1305
01:24:57,318 --> 01:24:58,512
It's about your father.

1306
01:24:58,787 --> 01:24:59,845
Mr. Shekhawat!

1307
01:25:07,529 --> 01:25:15,197
Sir, one question, please!
- Sir, please, sir.

1308
01:25:15,303 --> 01:25:16,827
Doctor said he needs
these medicines right now.

1309
01:25:16,905 --> 01:25:19,931
Uncle, how did this happen?

1310
01:25:20,341 --> 01:25:21,535
It's all because of you,
so why do you ask?

1311
01:25:21,609 --> 01:25:22,667
Let's go, Shakuntala. Aunt.
- Uncle.

1312
01:25:22,744 --> 01:25:24,473
Please Shakuntala, let's go.

1313
01:25:26,681 --> 01:25:28,410
Hello, Mr. Vijay.
- Yes, Sir.

1314
01:25:28,483 --> 01:25:29,814
I am Dr. Vikas Agarwal. - Yes.

1315
01:25:29,884 --> 01:25:31,215
Please come.

1316
01:25:31,886 --> 01:25:34,286
It's better to stay
childless than have such a son.

1317
01:25:34,355 --> 01:25:36,687
He has defamed Jaisalmer.

1318
01:25:36,758 --> 01:25:39,158
Mr. Ram has suffered
a brain hemorrhage...

1319
01:25:39,227 --> 01:25:41,161
...due to which his left side
has been completely paralysed.

1320
01:25:41,229 --> 01:25:43,163
Doctor, will he be fine again?

1321
01:25:43,765 --> 01:25:45,756
Judging by his age,
I can't say anything.

1322
01:25:46,201 --> 01:25:47,259
But one thing's certain.

1323
01:25:47,802 --> 01:25:49,770
Your father is a strong man.

1324
01:25:49,804 --> 01:25:53,171
Usually after such attacks,
a person slips into coma or...

1325
01:25:53,241 --> 01:25:58,770
Doctor, can I see my father please?
- Yes. - Thank you.

1326
01:26:06,721 --> 01:26:08,313
Come on. Vijay. Come in.

1327
01:26:11,593 --> 01:26:13,254
Have you checked the
temperature. -Ram Singh...

1328
01:26:13,328 --> 01:26:14,795
...look who has come to meet you.

1329
01:26:18,833 --> 01:26:19,891
Go away!

1330
01:26:21,436 --> 01:26:22,630
Go away!
- Ram Singh.

1331
01:26:22,704 --> 01:26:25,138
Father, please forgive me.
- Ram Singh, don't move.

1332
01:26:25,206 --> 01:26:27,401
Forgive me.
- Take him away. - Uncle.

1333
01:26:27,609 --> 01:26:28,667
Viju, leave!

1334
01:26:28,743 --> 01:26:29,801
Father, please.

1335
01:26:29,878 --> 01:26:31,402
Viju, leave from here.
- What happened to you, father!

1336
01:26:31,546 --> 01:26:34,538
Father! - Leave from here, or
else uncle's condition will worsen.

1337
01:26:34,616 --> 01:26:36,208
Nandu, what happened to father?
- Just go!

1338
01:26:37,752 --> 01:26:40,687
Doctor! Nurse! Please.

1339
01:26:40,755 --> 01:26:43,349
Collect the MRI report
from the first floor.

1340
01:26:43,424 --> 01:26:47,417
You'll get all three
reports from the ground floor.

1341
01:26:47,495 --> 01:26:51,158
Get the X-ray report from there too.

1342
01:26:51,199 --> 01:26:52,291
Coach!

1343
01:26:54,602 --> 01:26:55,660
Coach!

1344
01:26:55,770 --> 01:26:56,794
You...

1345
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:01,299
Go!

1346
01:27:12,787 --> 01:27:16,780
Mr. Shekhawat, how is
your father's condition now?

1347
01:27:16,858 --> 01:27:22,319
Mr. Shekhawat, answer us.

1348
01:27:25,166 --> 01:27:28,135
Shame on him! He had gone
to play for his country...

1349
01:27:28,169 --> 01:27:29,363
...but sold his conscience instead.

1350
01:27:29,537 --> 01:27:31,596
He's responsible for
his father's ruin!

1351
01:27:46,754 --> 01:27:51,623
"This is not what I'd imagined."

1352
01:27:52,293 --> 01:27:57,492
"How could this happen?"

1353
01:27:57,899 --> 01:28:03,166
"What have I done?"

1354
01:28:03,571 --> 01:28:08,634
"What have I done?"

1355
01:28:09,244 --> 01:28:12,179
"There's darkness everywhere."

1356
01:28:12,247 --> 01:28:18,379
"I can't see a single ray of light."

1357
01:28:20,388 --> 01:28:25,655
"I am lost."

1358
01:28:26,194 --> 01:28:30,722
"I had never imagined this."
- Excuse me.

1359
01:28:30,765 --> 01:28:36,226
"My hopes have been shattered."

1360
01:28:36,371 --> 01:28:44,210
"I never thought this would happen."

1361
01:28:44,545 --> 01:28:46,274
Uncle!

1362
01:28:46,547 --> 01:28:49,414
Doctor! Nurse!

1363
01:28:49,484 --> 01:28:50,542
Come quickly.

1364
01:28:50,618 --> 01:28:51,676
Uncle!

1365
01:29:28,790 --> 01:29:34,387
"My life, my world..."

1366
01:29:34,529 --> 01:29:40,229
"...is a gift from you!"

1367
01:29:40,335 --> 01:29:51,337
"Whenever I staggered,
you held me too."

1368
01:29:51,412 --> 01:29:56,816
"My life, my world..."

1369
01:29:56,884 --> 01:30:02,618
"...is a gift from you!"

1370
01:30:02,690 --> 01:30:14,568
"But I proved to be a curse to you."

1371
01:30:14,669 --> 01:30:16,159
Due to Vijay Shekhawat's scandal...

1372
01:30:16,204 --> 01:30:20,368
...our company and sponsors have
suffered losses worth millions.

1373
01:30:21,242 --> 01:30:23,642
That's why we are
suing him for 500 million.

1374
01:30:23,711 --> 01:30:28,705
"This is not what I'd imagined."

1375
01:30:29,317 --> 01:30:34,516
"How could this happen?"

1376
01:30:34,856 --> 01:30:40,192
"What have I done?"

1377
01:30:40,528 --> 01:30:45,522
"What have I done?"

1378
01:30:55,877 --> 01:30:59,142
The cricket board has
decided to suspend...

1379
01:30:59,213 --> 01:31:00,874
...Vijay Shekhawat from team India...

1380
01:31:01,482 --> 01:31:06,351
...and ban him from
international cricket for six months.

1381
01:31:13,161 --> 01:31:14,753
We have to return in a
week for a check-up.

1382
01:31:16,364 --> 01:31:17,388
Uncle, come.

1383
01:31:42,190 --> 01:31:43,248
Father...

1384
01:31:56,904 --> 01:31:59,532
Vijay, this is a civil case.

1385
01:32:00,274 --> 01:32:02,469
It can go on for 10-12 years.

1386
01:32:02,944 --> 01:32:04,605
And then, that fraud Andy Singh...

1387
01:32:04,745 --> 01:32:05,871
He will go for a settlement.

1388
01:32:05,947 --> 01:32:07,346
I don't want any settlement.

1389
01:32:08,282 --> 01:32:09,806
Give Andy Singh whatever he wants.

1390
01:32:10,952 --> 01:32:12,476
Stop being emotional, Vijay.

1391
01:32:12,954 --> 01:32:14,353
You'll go bankrupt.

1392
01:32:14,489 --> 01:32:15,956
You won't be left
with a single penny.

1393
01:32:17,291 --> 01:32:19,225
I don't want their money.

1394
01:32:25,366 --> 01:32:26,390
Nandu.

1395
01:32:29,203 --> 01:32:30,295
I feel completely alone, Nandu.

1396
01:32:31,506 --> 01:32:32,700
At least, you don't ignore me.

1397
01:32:35,776 --> 01:32:37,175
Nandu, please forgive me.

1398
01:32:37,445 --> 01:32:38,503
Leave me.

1399
01:32:52,460 --> 01:32:55,224
How long will you hide
in the dark like a coward?

1400
01:32:58,799 --> 01:33:01,199
If you want me to forgive you,
your father to forgive you...

1401
01:33:01,235 --> 01:33:03,203
...your team and your
fans to forgive you...

1402
01:33:03,271 --> 01:33:05,603
...then stop
apologising and do something.

1403
01:33:08,342 --> 01:33:12,210
Prove it. You made a mistake
as you were greedy for money...

1404
01:33:12,280 --> 01:33:15,477
...and now you are
ready to make up for it!

1405
01:33:17,818 --> 01:33:18,944
Pick up the bat and play.

1406
01:33:19,820 --> 01:33:22,948
Nandu, I can't play again.

1407
01:33:28,763 --> 01:33:29,889
I completely forgot.

1408
01:33:30,798 --> 01:33:33,562
Vijay Shekhawat only
plays for the money.

1409
01:33:35,803 --> 01:33:36,861
Stop it, Nandu.

1410
01:33:39,707 --> 01:33:41,368
I can't play even if I want to.

1411
01:33:43,711 --> 01:33:44,905
I have a serious back problem.

1412
01:33:46,781 --> 01:33:47,907
I need to undergo surgery.

1413
01:33:50,251 --> 01:33:52,515
And I don't have the money.

1414
01:34:11,339 --> 01:34:13,671
If a man realises his mistake...

1415
01:34:15,543 --> 01:34:17,477
...should he get
another chance, Father?

1416
01:34:19,614 --> 01:34:23,607
Only if he realises his mistake.

1417
01:34:30,157 --> 01:34:31,419
Please help Viju, Father.

1418
01:34:45,640 --> 01:34:50,168
Uncle, I'm taking
Viju to Australia...

1419
01:34:50,244 --> 01:34:53,907
...to get his back operated.

1420
01:34:56,717 --> 01:34:58,446
Viju wants to play cricket again.

1421
01:35:00,655 --> 01:35:01,713
Uncle!

1422
01:35:02,723 --> 01:35:04,452
Uncle, can you once...

1423
01:35:21,742 --> 01:35:23,209
Nandu, let's go.

1424
01:35:23,277 --> 01:35:24,335
It's time for the flight to arrive.

1425
01:35:24,612 --> 01:35:25,670
Yes.

1426
01:35:39,894 --> 01:35:42,192
There's nothing to worry
about the surgery, Vijay.

1427
01:35:42,296 --> 01:35:43,593
You will be home in two weeks.

1428
01:35:44,165 --> 01:35:46,599
Good luck, Vijay. You
are in very good hands.

1429
01:35:46,667 --> 01:35:47,759
Thank you, Dr. Smith.

1430
01:35:47,868 --> 01:35:49,165
Anything for you, Brett.

1431
01:35:49,570 --> 01:35:50,628
Thank you!

1432
01:35:50,705 --> 01:35:51,763
Thank you so much, Brett.

1433
01:35:52,506 --> 01:35:53,768
Do you think I'm doing this for you?

1434
01:35:54,241 --> 01:35:56,573
I'm just helping you become fit so
that I can mess you up on the ground.

1435
01:35:59,580 --> 01:36:00,638
Thank you.
- Welcome.

1436
01:36:00,715 --> 01:36:01,773
Thank you.
- Welcome.

1437
01:36:03,651 --> 01:36:04,777
Don't worry, Viju.

1438
01:36:05,186 --> 01:36:06,244
Just relax.

1439
01:36:06,387 --> 01:36:07,445
Everything will be fine.

1440
01:36:18,599 --> 01:36:20,590
'Another house
unlawfully acquired... '

1441
01:36:20,701 --> 01:36:23,329
Hello!
- Yes, dear.

1442
01:36:23,471 --> 01:36:25,336
Mother, the
operation was successful.

1443
01:36:25,406 --> 01:36:26,600
And Viju has
regained consciousness too.

1444
01:36:27,208 --> 01:36:28,539
Thank God.

1445
01:36:28,809 --> 01:36:32,745
Mother, let uncle know about it.
- Yes, right away.

1446
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:34,677
Mother, I'll call you later.

1447
01:36:37,818 --> 01:36:38,876
Thank God.

1448
01:36:39,620 --> 01:36:41,747
Listen, Nandu had called.

1449
01:36:42,156 --> 01:36:43,214
Is everything fine?

1450
01:36:44,225 --> 01:36:48,355
Nandu was saying that
Viju's operation was successful.

1451
01:36:48,562 --> 01:36:50,894
Congratulations, Ram Singh.
Viju is well again.

1452
01:36:51,599 --> 01:36:52,691
It's fine.

1453
01:36:59,373 --> 01:37:01,204
No discomfort.
- No, better.

1454
01:37:01,575 --> 01:37:02,633
Good.

1455
01:37:04,712 --> 01:37:06,907
Sorry, Vijay, but I'm
breaking our hospital rules.

1456
01:37:07,248 --> 01:37:08,909
But can you do me a favour?
- Yes!

1457
01:37:09,250 --> 01:37:13,448
My son John is an ardent fan of
yours and he wanted to meet you.

1458
01:37:13,521 --> 01:37:14,579
Yes, sure.

1459
01:37:18,659 --> 01:37:19,717
Come in.

1460
01:37:22,263 --> 01:37:24,857
Wow, Vijay, I really
love your hook shot.

1461
01:37:25,766 --> 01:37:27,529
Can I please have your autograph?

1462
01:37:27,768 --> 01:37:28,826
Of course, you can.

1463
01:37:32,606 --> 01:37:35,666
Vijay Shekhawat.
- Wow.

1464
01:37:37,144 --> 01:37:38,202
Here you go.

1465
01:37:38,279 --> 01:37:39,337
Thank you.
- Welcome.

1466
01:37:39,413 --> 01:37:40,539
Can I shake your hands too?

1467
01:37:43,217 --> 01:37:44,275
Here we go, Doctor.

1468
01:37:44,418 --> 01:37:45,885
Thanks Vijay. Have a good day.

1469
01:37:46,420 --> 01:37:48,285
Bye, Maria.
- Bye, Doctor.

1470
01:37:48,689 --> 01:37:50,350
Medicine.
- Come on!

1471
01:37:51,759 --> 01:37:52,885
Do you know where Nandu is?

1472
01:37:53,294 --> 01:37:54,352
She went to get a coffee.

1473
01:37:54,562 --> 01:37:57,156
You know, this is the first
time she has left your side...

1474
01:37:57,198 --> 01:37:58,893
...since you went in for surgery.

1475
01:37:59,767 --> 01:38:02,600
The poor girl hardly slept a
wink in the last 48 hours.

1476
01:38:04,305 --> 01:38:07,763
You're a very lucky man
to have a wife like her...

1477
01:38:07,842 --> 01:38:09,901
Maria, she is not my wife.
- Hey, Viju.

1478
01:38:10,644 --> 01:38:12,305
Hi Maria.
- Hey, Nandini.

1479
01:38:13,380 --> 01:38:16,372
Are you fine?
- Yes.

1480
01:38:21,188 --> 01:38:22,917
Bye, Nandini.
- Bye.

1481
01:38:23,724 --> 01:38:26,716
"I always knew you."

1482
01:38:27,194 --> 01:38:30,527
"But I could never recognise you."

1483
01:38:30,564 --> 01:38:37,663
"I never understood
the heart felt this way."

1484
01:38:37,805 --> 01:38:42,401
"What has happened in just a few
moments?" - What happened? - Nothing.

1485
01:38:44,879 --> 01:38:51,216
"I can see only you, only you."

1486
01:38:51,752 --> 01:38:57,884
"I can see only you, only you."

1487
01:39:04,598 --> 01:39:07,761
Try to walk by yourself.

1488
01:39:08,469 --> 01:39:09,595
Come on, walk.

1489
01:39:12,239 --> 01:39:13,365
That's right.

1490
01:39:13,574 --> 01:39:15,439
See, you can walk.

1491
01:39:21,782 --> 01:39:27,652
"My love was
always in front of me..."

1492
01:39:28,589 --> 01:39:34,391
"...but I kept looking for it."

1493
01:39:35,462 --> 01:39:47,465
"I'd reached my destination
but I was hardly aware of it."

1494
01:39:48,409 --> 01:39:55,406
"I never understood
the heart felt this way."

1495
01:39:56,216 --> 01:40:00,277
"What has happened in
just a few moments?"

1496
01:40:02,623 --> 01:40:08,892
"I can see only you, only you."

1497
01:40:09,563 --> 01:40:15,866
"I can see only you, only you."

1498
01:40:17,237 --> 01:40:18,295
Okay?

1499
01:40:18,839 --> 01:40:19,897
You are doing fine, Vijay.

1500
01:40:20,374 --> 01:40:21,898
I think you can
leave the hospital now.

1501
01:40:22,643 --> 01:40:24,838
You mean, we can go
back to India now?

1502
01:40:25,245 --> 01:40:26,644
Not so soon, Nandini.

1503
01:40:26,714 --> 01:40:28,841
I need to see him after a week
for a final check-up. - Sure.

1504
01:40:38,859 --> 01:40:41,657
There's only one bed here.

1505
01:40:42,663 --> 01:40:43,721
Your bags.

1506
01:40:44,531 --> 01:40:45,555
Excuse me.
- Yes.

1507
01:40:45,666 --> 01:40:47,361
Do you have any room
with two single beds?

1508
01:40:47,534 --> 01:40:48,831
Sorry sir, we have only doubles.

1509
01:40:49,169 --> 01:40:50,261
Good day.

1510
01:41:03,417 --> 01:41:15,887
"How can I live apart with you?"

1511
01:41:16,764 --> 01:41:29,370
"Sweetheart, I cannot
endure our separation."

1512
01:41:30,244 --> 01:41:32,576
"So many desires in the heart."

1513
01:41:33,247 --> 01:41:34,305
Pyaar (Love)!

1514
01:41:34,648 --> 01:41:36,513
Viju, that's not English!

1515
01:41:37,251 --> 01:41:38,309
It's the same in every language.

1516
01:41:38,519 --> 01:41:41,920
"What has happened in
just a few moments?"

1517
01:41:44,191 --> 01:41:45,658
Hey, Vijay.
- Can we have a picture? - Sure.

1518
01:41:45,726 --> 01:41:46,784
Thank you.

1519
01:41:49,863 --> 01:41:50,921
Smile.

1520
01:41:51,398 --> 01:41:56,893
"I can see only you, only you."

1521
01:41:57,471 --> 01:42:00,338
"I always knew you."

1522
01:42:00,674 --> 01:42:03,939
"But I could never recognise you."

1523
01:42:04,211 --> 01:42:10,946
"I never understood
the heart felt this way."

1524
01:42:11,618 --> 01:42:15,952
"What has happened in
just a few moments?"

1525
01:42:18,492 --> 01:42:24,692
"I can see only you, only you."

1526
01:42:25,299 --> 01:42:31,431
"I can see only you, only you."

1527
01:42:39,179 --> 01:42:40,578
There's nothing to worry about.

1528
01:42:40,647 --> 01:42:43,582
Just continue with your
physiotherapy and you will be fine.

1529
01:42:44,251 --> 01:42:46,378
Does that mean, I can
start playing cricket soon?

1530
01:42:46,720 --> 01:42:47,778
Sure you can.

1531
01:42:47,921 --> 01:42:49,320
See you on the pitch soon.

1532
01:42:49,456 --> 01:42:50,514
Thank you so much, Doctor.

1533
01:42:50,591 --> 01:42:52,252
Thank you for everything.
- Pleasure.

1534
01:42:52,326 --> 01:42:53,384
Bye, Doctor.
- Bye, Nandini.

1535
01:43:04,338 --> 01:43:05,737
Son, how is your back now?

1536
01:43:07,207 --> 01:43:08,265
It's better.

1537
01:43:08,742 --> 01:43:10,403
Ram Singh, look who has come.

1538
01:43:10,611 --> 01:43:11,737
Viju!

1539
01:43:14,214 --> 01:43:15,272
Hello.

1540
01:43:17,417 --> 01:43:18,475
Father...

1541
01:43:19,353 --> 01:43:20,820
I'm going to start life afresh.

1542
01:43:22,556 --> 01:43:23,887
I know you won't talk to me.

1543
01:43:26,226 --> 01:43:27,557
At least you can bless me.

1544
01:44:04,231 --> 01:44:05,789
"The journey is not easy."

1545
01:44:06,633 --> 01:44:08,294
"There are many hurdles."

1546
01:44:09,236 --> 01:44:10,794
"Many dangers lurk ahead."

1547
01:44:11,672 --> 01:44:13,469
"Learn from your mistakes."

1548
01:44:13,941 --> 01:44:20,938
"The journey is not easy."

1549
01:44:22,816 --> 01:44:30,222
"There are many hurdles."

1550
01:44:31,558 --> 01:44:39,863
"Many dangers lurk ahead."

1551
01:44:41,768 --> 01:44:50,233
"Learn from your mistakes."

1552
01:44:51,245 --> 01:44:54,442
"Don't be scared."

1553
01:44:54,581 --> 01:44:57,914
"It's your test."

1554
01:44:58,185 --> 01:45:02,645
"You will achieve victory."

1555
01:45:02,723 --> 01:45:07,456
"Victory! Victory!"

1556
01:45:09,730 --> 01:45:10,788
'My house! '
- 'Uncle.'

1557
01:45:14,835 --> 01:45:17,463
'To hell with you.'

1558
01:45:29,483 --> 01:45:32,350
'Find yourself a new father.'

1559
01:45:32,819 --> 01:45:36,687
"Another dawn, a new path."

1560
01:45:37,424 --> 01:45:41,690
"Find one for yourself."

1561
01:45:41,828 --> 01:45:42,886
Come on, Viju!

1562
01:45:45,599 --> 01:45:52,300
"Another dawn, a new path."
- Focus on the ball.

1563
01:45:52,372 --> 01:45:58,902
"Find one for yourself."

1564
01:45:59,446 --> 01:46:05,646
"That will take you
to your destination."

1565
01:46:06,253 --> 01:46:10,713
"That will help
you achieve victory."

1566
01:46:10,791 --> 01:46:16,787
"Victory! Victory!"

1567
01:46:37,284 --> 01:46:38,342
All the best.

1568
01:46:38,418 --> 01:46:40,215
V for Viju!

1569
01:47:21,395 --> 01:47:24,660
The six month ban on Vijay
Shekhawat is to end soon.

1570
01:47:25,165 --> 01:47:27,531
And his Ranji average is 6.

1571
01:47:27,768 --> 01:47:31,169
He's in top form right
before Airtel Champions trophy.

1572
01:47:31,538 --> 01:47:33,870
Can he make it to team India again?

1573
01:47:34,141 --> 01:47:35,733
Let's ask Mr. Sidhu.

1574
01:47:36,276 --> 01:47:40,736
Madam, mistakes can destroy you.

1575
01:47:40,881 --> 01:47:44,749
And mistakes can also be the
stepping stone to success.

1576
01:47:44,885 --> 01:47:47,877
What a dramatic
comeback in the man's life!

1577
01:47:48,155 --> 01:47:51,556
Remarkable! Absolutely outstanding!

1578
01:47:55,362 --> 01:47:57,887
Coach!
- What is it?

1579
01:47:58,765 --> 01:48:01,165
Coach... - If you have come here
to talk about your selection...

1580
01:48:01,201 --> 01:48:02,361
...you can just forget it.

1581
01:48:05,305 --> 01:48:06,363
I am sorry, Coach.

1582
01:48:07,441 --> 01:48:08,567
That's all I want to say.

1583
01:48:17,517 --> 01:48:19,712
Hey Prince, superb shot!

1584
01:48:23,657 --> 01:48:26,649
Wow, that's a lovely shot!

1585
01:48:28,595 --> 01:48:30,859
Hey Prince, let's forget the past.

1586
01:48:31,331 --> 01:48:32,855
And start afresh.

1587
01:48:33,733 --> 01:48:34,825
Once again!

1588
01:48:35,235 --> 01:48:36,634
Andy and Viju together.

1589
01:48:38,338 --> 01:48:39,396
Prince.

1590
01:48:40,407 --> 01:48:43,672
Look, Vijay, it's very difficult for
you to make it to the Indian team.

1591
01:48:44,211 --> 01:48:46,406
But your friend Andy
can ensure that you do.

1592
01:48:47,280 --> 01:48:48,542
You are getting emotional again.

1593
01:48:48,748 --> 01:48:51,342
You still seem to be under
your father's influence.

1594
01:48:51,551 --> 01:48:53,416
Last time, your father...

1595
01:48:56,423 --> 01:48:58,357
Don't you dare say
anything against my father!

1596
01:48:58,892 --> 01:49:01,417
Andy, you are responsible
for my father's condition.

1597
01:49:02,629 --> 01:49:04,290
You ruined my life.

1598
01:49:11,505 --> 01:49:12,563
Sir, will Vijay
Shekhawat get back in the team.

1599
01:49:12,639 --> 01:49:14,504
Excuse me.
- Sorry, no comments.

1600
01:49:14,574 --> 01:49:16,565
No comments.
- What will the management decide?

1601
01:49:16,776 --> 01:49:19,643
Will he get back in the team?

1602
01:49:19,779 --> 01:49:22,179
Team India's coach Dilip
Malhotra has arrived...

1603
01:49:22,249 --> 01:49:24,843
...at the Intercontinental,
the Grand.

1604
01:49:25,185 --> 01:49:27,119
The selection committee
members are going to announce...

1605
01:49:27,187 --> 01:49:29,655
...the Indian Team
for the Airtel Trophy.

1606
01:49:30,190 --> 01:49:31,384
Cricket lovers all over
the country have only...

1607
01:49:31,458 --> 01:49:32,652
...one question in their mind.

1608
01:49:32,859 --> 01:49:36,192
Will Vijay Shekhawat get a
chance to play in team India again?

1609
01:49:36,329 --> 01:49:39,127
Yusuf Pathan! Rohit Sharma!
Robin Uthappa!

1610
01:49:39,166 --> 01:49:41,327
Gautam Gambhir! Suresh Raina!

1611
01:49:41,635 --> 01:49:48,336
Murli Kartik! Ishant Sharma!
Praveen Kumar! Munaf Patel!

1612
01:49:49,209 --> 01:49:50,403
And what about Vijay Shekhawat, sir?

1613
01:49:50,677 --> 01:49:51,871
Why aren't we talking about him?

1614
01:49:52,212 --> 01:49:53,873
You want Vijay Shekhawat to play?

1615
01:49:54,281 --> 01:49:56,408
Gentlemen, how can you trust him?

1616
01:49:56,683 --> 01:49:58,150
But going by his current form...

1617
01:49:58,218 --> 01:49:59,617
...team India needs him.
- Exactly.

1618
01:49:59,686 --> 01:50:00,744
His average is 0!

1619
01:50:00,820 --> 01:50:02,412
Then why not bring all
the goons in the team?

1620
01:50:02,622 --> 01:50:04,886
Sorry, Chairman, these
are personal attacks.

1621
01:50:05,158 --> 01:50:07,888
No... - No, these are not
personal attacks. - Please!

1622
01:50:08,295 --> 01:50:10,388
Gentlemen, let's take a vote.

1623
01:50:11,498 --> 01:50:14,160
All those in favour
of Vijay Shekhawat...

1624
01:50:14,201 --> 01:50:15,862
...please raise your hands.

1625
01:50:20,774 --> 01:50:24,107
The Indian team for
Airtel Champions trophy is...

1626
01:50:25,712 --> 01:50:28,112
Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir,

1627
01:50:28,181 --> 01:50:30,115
Dinesh Kartik, Suresh Raina.

1628
01:50:30,183 --> 01:50:32,845
Rohit Sharma, Harbajhan Singh,

1629
01:50:33,186 --> 01:50:34,847
Viju! Viju!
- Yes!

1630
01:50:35,322 --> 01:50:36,846
Viju, dear, no more tears.

1631
01:50:37,324 --> 01:50:39,155
You have cleared the selections.

1632
01:50:39,259 --> 01:50:40,658
The Lord has blessed you.

1633
01:50:40,860 --> 01:50:42,851
You will play in
the Champions trophy!

1634
01:50:43,463 --> 01:50:45,158
You will play in the
Champions trophy! - Viju!

1635
01:50:48,768 --> 01:50:49,826
See.

1636
01:51:09,422 --> 01:51:10,480
Father!

1637
01:51:13,426 --> 01:51:15,223
I am going to play for
the Champions trophy.

1638
01:51:18,398 --> 01:51:20,161
I know you won't
give me your blessings.

1639
01:51:25,305 --> 01:51:30,174
But I promise you,
your son will return.

1640
01:51:41,454 --> 01:51:42,512
Viju.

1641
01:51:44,457 --> 01:51:45,515
All the best.

1642
01:51:48,194 --> 01:51:49,252
Thank you.

1643
01:51:52,432 --> 01:51:56,562
Uncle, you always said
that a man leads two lives.

1644
01:51:57,203 --> 01:51:58,465
One, when he learns to live.

1645
01:51:58,538 --> 01:52:00,335
And second, when he
lives what he has learnt.

1646
01:52:02,208 --> 01:52:05,200
Viju is going to live his
second life, just for you.

1647
01:52:07,347 --> 01:52:09,474
How can you be so cold-hearted,
Uncle?

1648
01:52:15,689 --> 01:52:17,281
Wonderful fireworks!

1649
01:52:17,357 --> 01:52:19,757
An explosive beginning of
Airtel's Champions Trophy.

1650
01:52:19,893 --> 01:52:21,827
Wonderful atmosphere!
What a beautiful scene!

1651
01:52:22,629 --> 01:52:25,598
Eight teams of the world will battle
it out for this beautiful trophy.

1652
01:52:26,166 --> 01:52:28,191
These teams have been
divided into two teams.

1653
01:52:28,368 --> 01:52:31,826
Group A includes India, Sri Lanka,
South Africa and England.

1654
01:52:31,905 --> 01:52:33,839
And group B will include Australia...

1655
01:52:34,174 --> 01:52:36,369
...New Zealand,
Pakistan, and West Indies.

1656
01:52:36,443 --> 01:52:37,774
And the first match
will be played tomorrow.

1657
01:52:37,844 --> 01:52:39,243
Between India and Sri Lanka.

1658
01:52:39,312 --> 01:52:40,370
Two good teams.

1659
01:52:40,447 --> 01:52:42,176
We hope to see a good competition.

1660
01:52:42,515 --> 01:52:45,177
And you can see the
Airtel Championship's Trophy...

1661
01:52:45,251 --> 01:52:47,776
...live on Neo Cricket.

1662
01:52:49,389 --> 01:52:50,583
Mother, hurry up. The
match is about to begin.

1663
01:52:50,657 --> 01:52:54,184
Robin Utthappa, R.P. Singh,
Yusuf Pathan...

1664
01:52:54,260 --> 01:52:57,195
And the 12th man in this
match will be Vijay Shekhawat.

1665
01:52:59,833 --> 01:53:01,892
Vijay will surely
play in the next match.

1666
01:53:02,202 --> 01:53:03,863
I am sure.

1667
01:53:07,207 --> 01:53:09,266
Chaminda Vaas, left
arm over, ready to bowl.

1668
01:53:09,342 --> 01:53:10,468
He has again bowled a good length.

1669
01:53:10,543 --> 01:53:13,205
And the batsman
played defensive again.

1670
01:53:18,218 --> 01:53:22,552
Rohit Sharma's wonderful innings
led team India to a spectacular win.

1671
01:53:23,223 --> 01:53:25,885
Viju, you always knew
that the path was not easy.

1672
01:53:27,293 --> 01:53:30,285
Please don't lose hope.

1673
01:53:31,164 --> 01:53:33,189
Everything will be fine soon.

1674
01:53:33,400 --> 01:53:34,458
Bye.

1675
01:53:47,180 --> 01:53:49,171
With Rohit Sharma's
spectacular century...

1676
01:53:49,249 --> 01:53:51,774
...team India defeated South Africa.

1677
01:53:51,851 --> 01:53:53,910
Dimitri
Mascarenhas is ready to bowl.

1678
01:53:54,187 --> 01:53:55,245
Short pitched ball.

1679
01:53:55,321 --> 01:53:57,186
And Rohit Sharma has
pulled it easily for a four!

1680
01:53:57,257 --> 01:54:00,454
And with this, he
completes his century.

1681
01:54:04,197 --> 01:54:07,189
India beats
England by five wickets...

1682
01:54:07,233 --> 01:54:09,292
...with Rohit
Sharma's unmatched 108 runs.

1683
01:54:11,204 --> 01:54:13,866
Team India's spectacular win
over England in the quarterfinals.

1684
01:54:14,808 --> 01:54:18,266
Now, India will face
Pakistan for the semi-finals.

1685
01:54:18,812 --> 01:54:20,211
Whenever India and
Pakistan face off in the fields...

1686
01:54:20,280 --> 01:54:22,680
...the result has always
been a gruelling match.

1687
01:54:22,749 --> 01:54:25,411
And something similar is
being expected even today.

1688
01:54:25,552 --> 01:54:27,884
Vijay Shekhawat will be the
12th man in this match too.

1689
01:54:28,421 --> 01:54:30,150
Since the team is
displaying such brilliant efforts...

1690
01:54:30,223 --> 01:54:32,418
...he can't seem to make a
place for himself in the top 11.

1691
01:54:34,160 --> 01:54:35,821
It was a challenging match
between India and Pakistan.

1692
01:54:35,895 --> 01:54:39,160
But India defeated Pakistan by
two wickets and entered the finals.

1693
01:55:00,386 --> 01:55:02,854
Rohit! Are you okay?

1694
01:55:03,790 --> 01:55:05,849
Bad news for an Indian cricket fan.

1695
01:55:06,192 --> 01:55:08,183
Indian team member Rohit Sharma...

1696
01:55:08,261 --> 01:55:11,719
...won't be able to play in the
finals due to a foot injury.

1697
01:55:11,931 --> 01:55:13,626
So, Mr. Sidhu, what do you feel?

1698
01:55:13,700 --> 01:55:15,190
Who will replace Rohit Sharma?

1699
01:55:15,435 --> 01:55:18,404
One and only, Vijay Shekhawat.

1700
01:55:25,478 --> 01:55:26,536
Hello.

1701
01:55:26,746 --> 01:55:29,340
Sir... everyone is
waiting for the announcement.

1702
01:55:29,749 --> 01:55:31,478
I know.

1703
01:55:46,165 --> 01:55:47,189
Coach!

1704
01:55:49,769 --> 01:55:52,169
Some years ago, a
boy approached you.

1705
01:55:53,773 --> 01:55:58,176
And you gave him a
chance to play for team India.

1706
01:56:00,780 --> 01:56:02,179
But that boy strayed from his path...

1707
01:56:03,516 --> 01:56:05,780
...and made the biggest
mistake of his life.

1708
01:56:07,787 --> 01:56:09,186
He broke your trust.

1709
01:56:14,460 --> 01:56:15,722
Although I don't have the right...

1710
01:56:17,430 --> 01:56:19,398
...that boy is asking
you for another chance...

1711
01:56:21,401 --> 01:56:22,425
...to play for team India.

1712
01:56:24,137 --> 01:56:28,335
And he promises to never
break your trust again.

1713
01:56:31,678 --> 01:56:36,138
Give me another chance,
coach. Just one.

1714
01:56:53,800 --> 01:56:55,768
Sir, everyone is
waiting for the announcement.

1715
01:56:58,171 --> 01:56:59,229
Excuse me.

1716
01:57:00,173 --> 01:57:03,438
Ladies and gentlemen,
tomorrow's finals...

1717
01:57:06,179 --> 01:57:07,510
...will be played by Vijay Shekhawat.

1718
01:57:08,581 --> 01:57:09,775
Thank you.

1719
01:57:14,587 --> 01:57:15,645
Yes, Viju.

1720
01:57:15,722 --> 01:57:18,782
Nandu, I'm playing
the finals tomorrow.

1721
01:57:19,392 --> 01:57:21,451
What?
- Yes.

1722
01:57:23,763 --> 01:57:26,323
All the best, Viju.
- Thanks, Nandu.

1723
01:57:27,567 --> 01:57:30,468
Uncle, Viju is playing
the finals tomorrow.

1724
01:57:35,475 --> 01:57:37,136
'You will be playing
for your country.'

1725
01:57:37,810 --> 01:57:39,402
'Keep it close to your heart.'

1726
01:57:41,748 --> 01:57:44,148
Robin Utthappa and
Dinesh Kartik's partnership...

1727
01:57:44,217 --> 01:57:45,343
...has brought the match alive.

1728
01:57:45,418 --> 01:57:47,352
They have caused a
frenzy amongst the fans.

1729
01:57:47,420 --> 01:57:51,754
Against the mammoth score
of 38, India is on 150/4!

1730
01:57:52,225 --> 01:57:53,624
He has played it with
the twist of his wrist.

1731
01:57:53,693 --> 01:57:55,160
Beautiful glance.

1732
01:57:55,228 --> 01:57:57,287
Another boundary for Robin Utthappa!

1733
01:57:57,497 --> 01:57:59,158
Maninder, it's very
important for the Indians...

1734
01:57:59,198 --> 01:58:00,358
...to continue this partnership.

1735
01:58:01,367 --> 01:58:02,857
The Indian score is at 160/4...

1736
01:58:03,169 --> 01:58:04,693
...and Simon Katich is
ready to bowl his next.

1737
01:58:05,638 --> 01:58:06,696
He has pulled that away.

1738
01:58:07,240 --> 01:58:10,175
Above the ropes. That's six runs!

1739
01:58:10,376 --> 01:58:13,504
It's praiseworthy the way
Kartik has supported Utthappa.

1740
01:58:13,579 --> 01:58:16,912
And a lot depends on this partnership
if India wants to win the match.

1741
01:58:17,183 --> 01:58:20,175
Because the next
batsman is Vijay Shekhawat.

1742
01:58:23,389 --> 01:58:24,788
Brett Lee's next ball
and outside the off stump.

1743
01:58:24,857 --> 01:58:28,725
He tried to flick that. And a very
big setback for the Indian team.

1744
01:58:28,795 --> 01:58:30,524
Robin Utthappa scored 5 runs.

1745
01:58:30,563 --> 01:58:34,363
And India has lost its
fifth wicket at 10.

1746
01:58:34,434 --> 01:58:36,698
India still needs 218 runs.

1747
01:58:36,769 --> 01:58:38,794
They need a run rate of 9.0!

1748
01:58:38,871 --> 01:58:40,395
India in trouble again.

1749
01:58:40,740 --> 01:58:42,799
And now, Vijay
Shekhawat will bat next.

1750
01:58:43,142 --> 01:58:47,135
This is his first chance
to play after six months.

1751
01:58:47,213 --> 01:58:48,271
That's our boy.

1752
01:58:48,347 --> 01:58:49,405
Now, it will be fun.

1753
01:58:49,482 --> 01:58:50,540
Viju!

1754
01:58:51,150 --> 01:58:54,142
Chasing such a run rate is not
easy under so much pressure.

1755
01:58:54,220 --> 01:58:56,154
And especially for a
player who hasn't played...

1756
01:58:56,222 --> 01:58:58,417
...international cricket
for the last six months.

1757
01:58:58,558 --> 01:58:59,616
There's tension in the crowd.

1758
01:58:59,692 --> 01:59:01,353
Vijay will face Brett's first ball.

1759
01:59:01,427 --> 01:59:02,485
Brett Lee is ready to bowl.

1760
01:59:04,564 --> 01:59:06,156
Vijay's first ball after six months.

1761
01:59:06,199 --> 01:59:08,167
It seems like Brett Lee
knows that he is playing...

1762
01:59:08,201 --> 01:59:10,692
...international
cricket after a long time.

1763
01:59:10,770 --> 01:59:12,294
He must be under a lot of pressure.

1764
01:59:13,506 --> 01:59:14,700
He will fix his eyes
on the ball first.

1765
01:59:16,509 --> 01:59:18,306
And that's a spectacular six!

1766
01:59:18,377 --> 01:59:22,438
It seems like Vijay is
very comfortable on the pitch.

1767
01:59:22,515 --> 01:59:26,178
Because hitting such a big shot on
Bret Lee's ball is not that easy.

1768
01:59:26,252 --> 01:59:29,312
And if India wants to win,
then he'll have to bat like this.

1769
01:59:32,525 --> 01:59:33,583
Another spectacular shot!

1770
01:59:33,659 --> 01:59:35,524
This time, over the cover fielder.

1771
01:59:36,129 --> 01:59:37,323
Another boundary.

1772
01:59:38,765 --> 01:59:40,130
And with that, he
has hit another four.

1773
01:59:40,166 --> 01:59:41,224
He has played it between the gaps.

1774
01:59:41,334 --> 01:59:42,767
Andrew Symonds has no chance.

1775
01:59:43,669 --> 01:59:47,264
And a spectacular pull
shot by Dinesh Kartik!

1776
01:59:47,340 --> 01:59:48,398
Another six!

1777
01:59:50,743 --> 01:59:53,268
Another boundary
for Vijay Shekhawat.

1778
01:59:56,549 --> 01:59:58,414
Dinesh Kartik has played the spin.

1779
01:59:58,484 --> 02:00:01,351
And with this shot, Dinesh
Kartik completes his 50 runs!

1780
02:00:01,420 --> 02:00:05,356
And with Kartik's half century,
India's score is 211/5!

1781
02:00:06,759 --> 02:00:08,420
Dinesh Kartik has
played a very mature over.

1782
02:00:08,494 --> 02:00:11,156
But India still
needs a run rate of 9.0!

1783
02:00:11,697 --> 02:00:13,358
That's a unique shot
on the off square.

1784
02:00:13,399 --> 02:00:14,457
Another boundary.

1785
02:00:17,703 --> 02:00:19,637
Another pull shot. He could be out.

1786
02:00:19,705 --> 02:00:20,899
But no. Six runs.

1787
02:00:21,174 --> 02:00:22,436
The fielder stepped over.

1788
02:00:22,575 --> 02:00:23,701
India is 232/5!

1789
02:00:23,776 --> 02:00:25,767
They still need 156
runs off 104 balls.

1790
02:00:28,114 --> 02:00:29,172
That's another six!

1791
02:00:35,721 --> 02:00:38,781
And with that, Vijay
Shekhawat has completed 44 runs.

1792
02:00:39,125 --> 02:00:40,183
He's just one shot away to break...

1793
02:00:40,259 --> 02:00:42,727
...Sanath Jayasuriya's
record for the fastest 50!

1794
02:00:42,795 --> 02:00:44,126
Stuart Clarke's next ball.

1795
02:00:44,463 --> 02:00:47,227
And Vijay Shekhwat has
played it. Six runs!

1796
02:00:47,333 --> 02:00:49,426
And with that, he has become
the world record holder...

1797
02:00:49,535 --> 02:00:51,469
...for the fastest 50!

1798
02:00:55,141 --> 02:00:57,609
Vijay Shekhawat has hit four sixes
and four boundaries in this innings.

1799
02:00:57,677 --> 02:01:00,475
And anyone who has seen
this innings is very lucky.

1800
02:01:03,149 --> 02:01:04,207
Wonderful!

1801
02:01:04,283 --> 02:01:07,150
I think that this
innings will reassure India...

1802
02:01:07,220 --> 02:01:09,814
...that they can still win the match.

1803
02:01:10,356 --> 02:01:13,154
Because maintaining a run
rate of 9.0 is not an easy task.

1804
02:01:13,226 --> 02:01:15,353
And Vijay Shekhawat has
played a very mature game.

1805
02:01:15,428 --> 02:01:16,690
And with that, a wonderful single.

1806
02:01:17,163 --> 02:01:18,391
He has hit boundaries.

1807
02:01:18,497 --> 02:01:21,364
But Vijay hasn't
missed the singles either.

1808
02:01:26,706 --> 02:01:27,764
Yes.

1809
02:01:28,174 --> 02:01:29,232
Viju!

1810
02:01:29,308 --> 02:01:30,707
Kartik has scored 64 runs.

1811
02:01:31,177 --> 02:01:34,169
And gradually, this
partnership is becoming dangerous.

1812
02:01:36,849 --> 02:01:40,182
Absolutely. I have no words
left to praise this partnership.

1813
02:01:40,253 --> 02:01:44,519
Because a partnership of
116 runs... And that's out.

1814
02:01:47,193 --> 02:01:48,524
It's a very important
wicket for Australia.

1815
02:01:48,594 --> 02:01:50,391
Kartik has scored 64 runs.

1816
02:01:50,429 --> 02:01:53,489
And India has lost its
sixth wicket at 286!

1817
02:01:53,699 --> 02:01:56,759
India still needs
102 runs off 62 balls.

1818
02:01:56,836 --> 02:01:58,736
The required run rate
is ten runs per over.

1819
02:01:58,804 --> 02:02:00,328
And four wickets are remaining.

1820
02:02:01,340 --> 02:02:03,808
The next batsman on the
pitch is Yusuf Pathan.

1821
02:02:04,210 --> 02:02:05,541
Maninder, he is
considered to be a fine bowler.

1822
02:02:05,611 --> 02:02:07,875
But he is said to be
a good batsman too.

1823
02:02:07,947 --> 02:02:09,812
According to me, he
is a good all rounder.

1824
02:02:09,882 --> 02:02:11,213
But what I want to see is...

1825
02:02:11,284 --> 02:02:15,414
...whether he'll perform
under pressure or not.

1826
02:02:15,554 --> 02:02:17,681
He'll face Brad Hogg's first ball.

1827
02:02:20,426 --> 02:02:21,484
And out!

1828
02:02:21,827 --> 02:02:24,694
He is clean bold in the first ball.

1829
02:02:25,164 --> 02:02:26,392
Yusuf Pathan.

1830
02:02:29,602 --> 02:02:32,162
With that, Brad Hogg has a
chance to take a hat-trick.

1831
02:02:32,238 --> 02:02:36,698
The fans are hugely disappointed.

1832
02:02:37,176 --> 02:02:38,575
That's the specialty
of the Australian team.

1833
02:02:38,644 --> 02:02:41,169
Even though they are losing,
they come back with a bang...

1834
02:02:41,247 --> 02:02:44,444
...and take the
opponent team by surprise.

1835
02:02:48,187 --> 02:02:52,180
Praveen Kumar has to
avert this hat-trick.

1836
02:02:52,458 --> 02:02:53,857
They are in need of a partnership.

1837
02:02:53,926 --> 02:02:56,520
To support Vijay
Shekhawat on the crease...

1838
02:02:57,730 --> 02:02:58,788
...he will have to show some skill.

1839
02:02:58,831 --> 02:03:00,492
Brad Hogg's next ball.
Hat trick ball.

1840
02:03:00,633 --> 02:03:03,193
On the back foot and
that won't be a hat trick.

1841
02:03:03,269 --> 02:03:05,601
He showed maturity by
not hooking the shot.

1842
02:03:05,671 --> 02:03:07,798
The score is still 286/.

1843
02:03:07,873 --> 02:03:09,807
If you watch the score, Maninder,
they are going head to head.

1844
02:03:09,875 --> 02:03:13,470
Except that India has
lost two extra wickets.

1845
02:03:13,546 --> 02:03:15,207
That's where the
equation went wrong...

1846
02:03:15,281 --> 02:03:16,475
...Atul, because they
have lost two extra wickets.

1847
02:03:16,549 --> 02:03:19,211
Because now the entire responsibility
rests on Vijay Shekhawat.

1848
02:03:19,285 --> 02:03:20,411
Let's watch how he performs.

1849
02:03:22,755 --> 02:03:23,744
Another spectacular shot!

1850
02:03:51,851 --> 02:03:52,909
Yes!

1851
02:04:11,537 --> 02:04:12,595
And that's a bouncer!

1852
02:04:12,671 --> 02:04:16,664
The ball has hit him on
the head through the helmet.

1853
02:04:16,809 --> 02:04:18,868
Vijay Shekhawat is down.

1854
02:04:19,345 --> 02:04:21,210
Brett Lee has come running to him.

1855
02:04:21,280 --> 02:04:23,680
Seems like he is hurt badly.

1856
02:04:23,816 --> 02:04:26,216
And this can be a
very big setback for...

1857
02:04:26,285 --> 02:04:29,152
...Team India in
Airtel Champion Trophy.

1858
02:04:29,221 --> 02:04:31,485
He is bleeding.

1859
02:04:32,558 --> 02:04:34,219
Brett Lee seems quite worried too.

1860
02:04:34,293 --> 02:04:37,160
Maninder, it has
happened many times...

1861
02:04:37,196 --> 02:04:40,859
...that the ball slips through
the gap of the peak and the visor.

1862
02:04:41,167 --> 02:04:42,191
Dangerous injury.

1863
02:04:42,268 --> 02:04:47,171
And other than the bleeding,
we also have to see whether...

1864
02:04:47,239 --> 02:04:51,175
...his area of injury has
caused him any more problems.

1865
02:04:51,444 --> 02:04:54,174
Absolutely. And when you
get hit on the temple...

1866
02:04:54,246 --> 02:04:56,180
...it's quite difficult to focus too.

1867
02:04:56,248 --> 02:04:59,376
He can come back and bat again.

1868
02:04:59,452 --> 02:05:03,183
So, we have to see
whether he'll be...

1869
02:05:03,255 --> 02:05:06,247
...able to bat again
in the match or not.

1870
02:05:06,325 --> 02:05:07,792
And if he can't bat again...

1871
02:05:08,194 --> 02:05:11,220
...we can say that
India has lost this game.

1872
02:05:11,430 --> 02:05:13,625
And now, Pankaj
Singh has come to bat.

1873
02:05:13,699 --> 02:05:16,190
India still needs 5
runs off 4 balls.

1874
02:05:16,235 --> 02:05:17,600
Put him on the table. Spread it out.

1875
02:05:17,670 --> 02:05:19,194
And it seems impossible to win
this match with the tail enders.

1876
02:05:19,271 --> 02:05:20,397
Easy... careful... slowly.

1877
02:05:24,677 --> 02:05:28,135
India is all ready, Pankaj
Singh to face Brett Lee's ball.

1878
02:05:29,148 --> 02:05:31,343
Straight ball and
Pankaj Singh saved himself.

1879
02:05:31,750 --> 02:05:32,808
Maninder, it's impossible for the...

1880
02:05:32,885 --> 02:05:34,546
...tail-enders to face a
bowler like Brett Lee.

1881
02:05:34,620 --> 02:05:35,678
He has lost consciousness.

1882
02:05:35,754 --> 02:05:37,278
Let's take him to the hospital.

1883
02:05:37,356 --> 02:05:38,414
Alok.
- Yes, sir.

1884
02:05:38,491 --> 02:05:40,152
Get an ambulance immediately.

1885
02:05:40,826 --> 02:05:44,193
Praveen Kumar and Pankaj
Singh are trying their best.

1886
02:05:44,396 --> 02:05:46,159
Though it's difficult
to expect an average...

1887
02:05:46,198 --> 02:05:48,666
...of 12.0 per over
from the tail-enders.

1888
02:05:48,767 --> 02:05:50,166
It's absolutely impossible.

1889
02:05:50,236 --> 02:05:51,294
Sir, someone wants to talk to you.

1890
02:05:51,370 --> 02:05:52,632
No interviews.
- Okay.

1891
02:05:53,439 --> 02:05:54,497
Hello!

1892
02:05:54,573 --> 02:05:57,167
This is Vijay's friend
speaking. How is he?

1893
02:05:57,376 --> 02:05:58,843
Ma'am, we cannot say anything now.

1894
02:05:58,911 --> 02:06:00,173
We are taking him
to the hospital now.

1895
02:06:00,246 --> 02:06:01,440
Please call later.

1896
02:06:01,714 --> 02:06:03,181
I... Hello...

1897
02:06:09,455 --> 02:06:11,184
The body language of the
Australians shows that...

1898
02:06:11,257 --> 02:06:13,851
...they have become
extremely relaxed.

1899
02:06:13,926 --> 02:06:15,393
Because they see no danger
after getting...

1900
02:06:15,461 --> 02:06:17,395
...Vijay Shekhawat off the pitch.

1901
02:06:20,432 --> 02:06:21,831
Vijay!
- Vijay!

1902
02:06:22,201 --> 02:06:23,668
Take it easy.

1903
02:06:25,137 --> 02:06:26,661
Lay down, Vijay.
- What's the score?

1904
02:06:26,805 --> 02:06:28,602
Don't worry about the score.

1905
02:06:28,674 --> 02:06:29,868
We are taking you to the hospital.

1906
02:06:31,544 --> 02:06:33,273
What are you doing?

1907
02:06:34,613 --> 02:06:36,274
Symonds, where is the ambulance?

1908
02:06:36,348 --> 02:06:37,406
I will check.

1909
02:06:38,751 --> 02:06:40,343
Vijay.
- Okay.

1910
02:06:49,428 --> 02:06:51,896
This match only seems
like a formality now.

1911
02:07:08,647 --> 02:07:10,842
Brett Lee is ready.
He will bowl to Praveen Kumar.

1912
02:07:12,585 --> 02:07:14,314
That's a loose shot. And a single.

1913
02:07:14,386 --> 02:07:17,184
So, it's clear that the Indian
team is not going for the big shots.

1914
02:07:17,256 --> 02:07:18,314
And that was a close one.

1915
02:07:27,132 --> 02:07:29,430
Vijay! Vijay!

1916
02:07:37,142 --> 02:07:38,200
Vijay!

1917
02:07:39,478 --> 02:07:40,536
What's wrong?

1918
02:07:40,613 --> 02:07:41,671
Are you fine?

1919
02:07:42,348 --> 02:07:45,146
Doctor, let me play another game.

1920
02:07:45,217 --> 02:07:46,741
Nothing doing, we are
taking you to the hospital.

1921
02:07:48,153 --> 02:07:49,211
Hospital!

1922
02:07:49,421 --> 02:07:50,479
I won't go to the hospital.

1923
02:07:52,291 --> 02:07:53,349
I am going out to play!

1924
02:07:53,425 --> 02:07:54,483
Vijay, listen...

1925
02:07:55,628 --> 02:07:57,357
The required run rate is
increasing to over 11.0 per over.

1926
02:07:57,396 --> 02:07:59,557
And without Vijay Shekhawat,
it seems impossible.

1927
02:07:59,598 --> 02:08:02,192
The news is that maybe he's
being taken to the hospital.

1928
02:08:02,268 --> 02:08:04,168
That was a bad ball,
outside the leg stump.

1929
02:08:05,371 --> 02:08:06,702
You are being foolish, Vijay.

1930
02:08:07,172 --> 02:08:08,230
Don't be emotional.

1931
02:08:08,641 --> 02:08:09,699
What's the problem, Doctor?

1932
02:08:09,775 --> 02:08:10,833
Sir, he doesn't listen to us.

1933
02:08:10,909 --> 02:08:12,376
Sir, why don't you listen to me?

1934
02:08:13,779 --> 02:08:16,373
I'm absolutely fine. I
want to continue playing.

1935
02:08:16,849 --> 02:08:18,441
You are not fine, Vijay.

1936
02:08:18,784 --> 02:08:22,720
He could have suffered an
internal injury or internal bleeding.

1937
02:08:22,855 --> 02:08:24,379
His life can be in danger, sir.

1938
02:08:24,456 --> 02:08:26,151
There is no such thing.

1939
02:08:26,792 --> 02:08:28,191
Coach, let me play.

1940
02:08:28,260 --> 02:08:30,660
Please, I cannot allow this.

1941
02:08:30,729 --> 02:08:32,128
Sir, that's my decision.

1942
02:08:32,364 --> 02:08:34,355
No, that's my decision.

1943
02:08:34,767 --> 02:08:36,632
I am responsible
for the entire team.

1944
02:08:37,469 --> 02:08:39,334
And my final decision
is that you can't play.

1945
02:08:39,405 --> 02:08:41,669
Please, Coach.
- That's it, Vijay.

1946
02:08:41,740 --> 02:08:42,798
Coach.

1947
02:08:42,875 --> 02:08:44,137
Take him to the hospital.

1948
02:08:45,344 --> 02:08:46,538
India trailing behind.

1949
02:08:46,612 --> 02:08:48,204
With 324/!

1950
02:08:48,280 --> 02:08:49,338
That's clean bowled.

1951
02:08:49,548 --> 02:08:52,676
Pankaj Singh couldn't
play Stuart Clarke's ball.

1952
02:08:52,751 --> 02:08:55,549
And now, the match has completely
slipped into Australia's hands.

1953
02:08:55,621 --> 02:08:58,146
Now, the Indian team has no way
to achieve the target...

1954
02:08:58,223 --> 02:09:00,157
...as they have to chase
the score of 38 runs...

1955
02:09:00,225 --> 02:09:02,750
...with only two
more wickets in hand.

1956
02:09:02,895 --> 02:09:06,194
Vijay Shekhawat has
returned retired hurt.

1957
02:09:06,865 --> 02:09:09,459
I have a strong feeling that
this trophy will go to Australia.

1958
02:09:10,235 --> 02:09:13,363
So, the required run
rate now is 12.0 per over.

1959
02:09:13,439 --> 02:09:16,237
And the Indian supporters
have already accepted defeat.

1960
02:09:16,308 --> 02:09:18,833
They are slowly leaving the stadium.

1961
02:09:19,211 --> 02:09:20,701
And Stuart Clarke is
to bowl his last ball.

1962
02:09:21,847 --> 02:09:22,905
And, no runs.

1963
02:09:28,120 --> 02:09:30,384
Pravin Kumar will face
Brad Hogg's last ball.

1964
02:09:30,723 --> 02:09:31,781
And no runs off this ball.

1965
02:09:31,857 --> 02:09:34,451
The required run rate is
crossing 12 runs per over.

1966
02:09:34,526 --> 02:09:36,323
Disappointment
lurking in the Indian camp.

1967
02:09:42,568 --> 02:09:46,664
52 runs off 19 balls and
just two wickets in hand.

1968
02:09:46,872 --> 02:09:48,863
R. P Singh will face Katich.

1969
02:09:51,210 --> 02:09:52,268
That was an easy single.

1970
02:09:52,344 --> 02:09:55,404
But singles will not
make any difference here.

1971
02:10:03,455 --> 02:10:04,547
It's a very
difficult task for India.

1972
02:10:04,623 --> 02:10:06,147
They still need 50 runs.

1973
02:10:06,225 --> 02:10:08,557
And there's only Praveen Kumar
and R. P Singh at the crease.

1974
02:10:14,867 --> 02:10:17,301
Brad Hogg with his
last ball of the over.

1975
02:10:19,505 --> 02:10:20,836
He flipped it. An
effort to take a single.

1976
02:10:20,906 --> 02:10:22,498
Wonderful fielding
on his own bowling.

1977
02:10:22,574 --> 02:10:23,563
That's a direct hit!

1978
02:10:23,642 --> 02:10:25,109
And here's a chance
for the Australians...

1979
02:10:25,177 --> 02:10:27,839
...to win the
Airtel Champions trophy.

1980
02:10:28,313 --> 02:10:31,146
The ground umpire has asked
for the third umpire's decision.

1981
02:10:31,216 --> 02:10:34,583
And the replay clearly shows
that Praveen Kumar is out.

1982
02:10:34,653 --> 02:10:36,450
And that's the
decision of the third umpire.

1983
02:10:36,522 --> 02:10:39,184
Praveen Kumar has
been declared run out.

1984
02:10:40,259 --> 02:10:43,660
And the Australians seem to be sure
of winning the Champions' trophy.

1985
02:10:47,533 --> 02:10:50,730
It's impossible for Vijay
Shekhawat to come out on the field.

1986
02:10:50,803 --> 02:10:53,533
The doctors have said he won't be
able to play because of his injuries.

1987
02:10:58,510 --> 02:11:02,469
Coach. You told me.

1988
02:11:04,149 --> 02:11:09,451
A billion Indians live their
dreams through the 11 of us.

1989
02:11:11,690 --> 02:11:13,214
Don't ever shatter their dreams.

1990
02:11:15,761 --> 02:11:19,857
Coach, I have shattered
their dreams many a times.

1991
02:11:22,868 --> 02:11:27,237
This time, I have a
chance to fulfill their dream.

1992
02:11:29,842 --> 02:11:31,503
I won't shatter
their dream this time.

1993
02:11:34,313 --> 02:11:35,371
Vijay...

1994
02:11:49,661 --> 02:11:52,186
The Australian team is
conversing with the umpire.

1995
02:11:52,231 --> 02:11:53,289
Asking, what next?

1996
02:11:53,398 --> 02:11:55,593
The audience is leaving too.

1997
02:11:55,634 --> 02:11:57,602
Everyone is disappointed.

1998
02:11:57,669 --> 02:12:00,194
The Australians will surely
win the Airtel Champions trophy.

1999
02:12:00,272 --> 02:12:01,364
The Indian dressing
room is very disappointed.

2000
02:12:02,508 --> 02:12:03,566
Atul, what's that?

2001
02:12:03,876 --> 02:12:07,403
"Even if it bleeds, it will stop..."

2002
02:12:08,614 --> 02:12:12,607
"...but if this moment passes,
it won't come back."

2003
02:12:13,418 --> 02:12:16,353
I have rarely witnessed such
valiant acts on the cricket field.

2004
02:12:16,421 --> 02:12:18,218
Maybe that memory of Kumble during
his match against the West Indies...

2005
02:12:18,290 --> 02:12:19,348
...Viju is back...

2006
02:12:19,424 --> 02:12:21,756
...who even after a jaw injury
continued playing, is coming back.

2007
02:12:21,827 --> 02:12:24,159
The Indian supporters
cannot believe this too.

2008
02:12:24,196 --> 02:12:25,754
They seem to be very happy.

2009
02:12:26,665 --> 02:12:29,156
Atul, I remember
when Mohinder Amarnath...

2010
02:12:29,201 --> 02:12:33,160
...got 2-28 stitches on his face
but he still came back on the field...

2011
02:12:33,238 --> 02:12:35,172
...to play the next day...

2012
02:12:35,240 --> 02:12:37,834
...as that day's game was over.

2013
02:12:37,910 --> 02:12:44,372
So, we have to see if Vijay Shekhawat
can score 50 runs off 12 balls.

2014
02:12:44,583 --> 02:12:45,641
Stuart Clarke ready to bowl.

2015
02:12:45,918 --> 02:12:47,180
And that has been awarded a no-ball.

2016
02:12:47,252 --> 02:12:49,777
And that's a long six!

2017
02:12:49,855 --> 02:12:53,382
With that, Vijay
Shekhawat completes his century!

2018
02:12:53,458 --> 02:12:57,189
The Australian is surprised...

2019
02:12:57,229 --> 02:13:02,394
...to see the player hit a big six
after being injured on the head.

2020
02:13:02,601 --> 02:13:05,934
And now, India needs
43 runs off 12 balls.

2021
02:13:06,471 --> 02:13:08,405
The dressing room
atmosphere seems joyous again.

2022
02:13:08,473 --> 02:13:09,735
The hope has returned.

2023
02:13:09,808 --> 02:13:11,332
He has shown through this shot.

2024
02:13:11,410 --> 02:13:12,468
Viju! Viju!

2025
02:13:12,544 --> 02:13:15,877
There seems slight disappointment
in the Australian camp.

2026
02:13:15,948 --> 02:13:17,210
But by their body language,
it seems they know...

2027
02:13:17,282 --> 02:13:18,340
...that it's impossible for
the Indians to make it...

2028
02:13:18,417 --> 02:13:20,214
...and also from the way Brett
Lee talked to Stuart Clarke...

2029
02:13:20,285 --> 02:13:22,480
...and the next ball.

2030
02:13:24,156 --> 02:13:26,351
Free hit ball,
Stuart Clarke is ready.

2031
02:13:27,326 --> 02:13:28,554
Again a short pitched ball.

2032
02:13:28,627 --> 02:13:29,889
And Vijay Shekhawat
has hooked it again.

2033
02:13:30,162 --> 02:13:31,186
Another six!

2034
02:13:31,296 --> 02:13:33,196
A six on the free hit ball.

2035
02:13:33,265 --> 02:13:36,359
Come on, Viju!
- That's a splendid shot!

2036
02:13:36,401 --> 02:13:38,266
Stuart Clarke seems worried.

2037
02:13:38,337 --> 02:13:39,827
Brett Lee encourages him again.

2038
02:13:39,905 --> 02:13:41,839
The match is undergoing
some significant change.

2039
02:13:44,509 --> 02:13:45,908
The crowd seems
happy with that change.

2040
02:13:47,713 --> 02:13:49,180
This time, he has
played a spectacular shot.

2041
02:13:49,247 --> 02:13:50,373
He was in a very good position.

2042
02:13:50,782 --> 02:13:53,250
Over the long off.

2043
02:13:53,852 --> 02:13:55,183
The Australians must
be really worried...

2044
02:13:55,253 --> 02:13:57,847
...with the way Vijay
Shekhawat is batting.

2045
02:13:58,357 --> 02:14:00,450
Six!

2046
02:14:00,726 --> 02:14:02,853
And now, the match is turning
slightly in favour of India.

2047
02:14:02,928 --> 02:14:05,590
India's score 35/9!

2048
02:14:05,631 --> 02:14:07,690
And now they need 31
runs off 10 balls.

2049
02:14:07,799 --> 02:14:09,630
Vijay Shekhawat has
already hit three sixes.

2050
02:14:09,701 --> 02:14:11,191
Let's see what he does next.

2051
02:14:12,604 --> 02:14:14,367
He has played the
Virendra Sehwag shot.

2052
02:14:14,439 --> 02:14:15,497
Tried to bounce it.

2053
02:14:15,941 --> 02:14:17,806
Over the fence.

2054
02:14:17,876 --> 02:14:18,934
Another six!

2055
02:14:19,811 --> 02:14:21,870
Michael Clarke is tired.

2056
02:14:22,280 --> 02:14:26,307
India has come close
to winning this match.

2057
02:14:26,385 --> 02:14:27,875
Four sixes have been hit.

2058
02:14:28,353 --> 02:14:31,151
There have been only four batsmen
in the world to hit six sixes...

2059
02:14:31,223 --> 02:14:35,751
...they are Gary Sobers,
Ravi Shastri...

2060
02:14:35,827 --> 02:14:37,590
And that's the fifth six!

2061
02:14:38,163 --> 02:14:39,187
What timing!

2062
02:14:39,498 --> 02:14:41,159
Now everyone's waiting to know...

2063
02:14:41,199 --> 02:14:44,168
...if Vijay Shekhawat can
make another world record...

2064
02:14:44,236 --> 02:14:46,830
...by hitting another six.

2065
02:14:47,372 --> 02:14:50,705
It seems possible here.

2066
02:14:55,380 --> 02:14:56,506
This time, he was in
a wonderful position.

2067
02:14:56,581 --> 02:14:57,912
He tried to bounce it.

2068
02:14:58,450 --> 02:15:01,180
Over the square leg, the sixth six!

2069
02:15:01,687 --> 02:15:07,250
And that's the third Indian
to make a record in cricket.

2070
02:15:07,325 --> 02:15:09,452
Yuvraj Singh hit six
sixes in the 20-20 matches.

2071
02:15:09,528 --> 02:15:11,189
Herschelle Gibbs, in the World Cup...

2072
02:15:11,229 --> 02:15:12,321
...against Ireland.

2073
02:15:12,397 --> 02:15:14,194
And now, Vijay
Shekhawat has hit six sixes...

2074
02:15:14,232 --> 02:15:16,826
...in a single over
against Australia.

2075
02:15:16,902 --> 02:15:20,394
It seems like Vijay Shekhawat has
returned to achieve the impossible.

2076
02:15:20,539 --> 02:15:23,337
Because only 13 runs
are required in balls.

2077
02:15:23,408 --> 02:15:26,673
But it's important for
Vijay to stay on strike.

2078
02:15:26,745 --> 02:15:27,803
That's what the
Australian captain has done.

2079
02:15:27,879 --> 02:15:30,143
He has brought everyone
inside to stop the single.

2080
02:15:30,215 --> 02:15:33,207
We have to see what
Vijay plans to do.

2081
02:15:33,485 --> 02:15:36,283
Will he take the singles
or go for the shots again?

2082
02:15:36,421 --> 02:15:38,355
He played that well.

2083
02:15:38,423 --> 02:15:41,256
He did slip, but
managed to take the single.

2084
02:15:41,326 --> 02:15:42,418
Intelligent Cricket.

2085
02:15:43,895 --> 02:15:45,157
Looking at Vijay Shekhawat's form...

2086
02:15:45,197 --> 02:15:47,757
...it looks like he
will steal the match...

2087
02:15:49,868 --> 02:15:53,235
The last over and
India needs 12 runs to win.

2088
02:15:53,572 --> 02:15:54,903
Because Brett Lee
will bowl the last over.

2089
02:16:10,689 --> 02:16:11,747
Another six!

2090
02:16:14,860 --> 02:16:19,593
V for Viju! V for Viju!

2091
02:16:19,631 --> 02:16:21,189
And with that astounding six...

2092
02:16:21,233 --> 02:16:23,326
...he has brought the
Indian team so close to victory.

2093
02:16:23,735 --> 02:16:27,728
Just one six required from
Vijay to win this match.

2094
02:16:27,806 --> 02:16:29,398
Brett Lee is ready
to bowl the next ball.

2095
02:16:29,474 --> 02:16:30,805
And he has placed it.

2096
02:16:30,876 --> 02:16:33,140
He wants two runs off it.
That should come easy.

2097
02:16:33,211 --> 02:16:35,202
But no, R. P Singh has slipped.
- Come on. Come on.

2098
02:16:35,280 --> 02:16:36,679
Vijay Shekhawat wants to return.

2099
02:16:37,349 --> 02:16:38,407
But it's possible.

2100
02:16:38,817 --> 02:16:40,682
And he has lost the strike.

2101
02:16:45,557 --> 02:16:46,683
We have to take a
single at any cost.

2102
02:16:47,425 --> 02:16:50,292
The Australians have
a fabulous chance.

2103
02:16:50,395 --> 02:16:52,488
They know that only
one wicket remains.

2104
02:16:52,564 --> 02:16:54,759
And Brett Lee is looking for a
chance to throw in a yorker.

2105
02:16:55,200 --> 02:16:58,431
And now R. P. has only one
option to take a single.

2106
02:17:00,372 --> 02:17:01,839
R. P. Singh has
already made one mistake.

2107
02:17:07,579 --> 02:17:10,241
How's that?

2108
02:17:10,849 --> 02:17:12,441
Vijay Shekhawat is down.

2109
02:17:12,517 --> 02:17:16,385
It seems like he has
injured his head again.

2110
02:17:16,454 --> 02:17:17,785
He's looking very nervous.

2111
02:17:18,390 --> 02:17:21,188
It's now the turn of
the third umpire to say...

2112
02:17:21,259 --> 02:17:23,750
...whether India has
lost the match or not.

2113
02:17:23,862 --> 02:17:28,822
But what's tense is that Vijay
Shekhawat who is holding his head.

2114
02:17:31,469 --> 02:17:33,460
Viju, are you all right?
Shall I call the physio?

2115
02:17:35,807 --> 02:17:38,139
He has called for
the physiotherapist...

2116
02:17:38,210 --> 02:17:40,303
...to see his condition.

2117
02:17:40,378 --> 02:17:44,144
And if we see the replay, it
has been a powerful collision.

2118
02:17:44,216 --> 02:17:46,776
And it could be a run out too.

2119
02:17:47,152 --> 02:17:49,211
It's a difficult decision
for the third umpire too.

2120
02:17:49,287 --> 02:17:51,812
And India is tense.

2121
02:17:55,227 --> 02:17:57,752
We are still waiting for
the third umpire's decision.

2122
02:18:00,866 --> 02:18:02,766
The Australians think
they have won the match.

2123
02:18:02,801 --> 02:18:03,893
But it's not out.

2124
02:18:09,174 --> 02:18:10,698
Viju, come on, on
your feet immediately.

2125
02:18:14,446 --> 02:18:18,246
Now, only four runs
required off three balls.

2126
02:18:19,851 --> 02:18:22,581
The match has reached
a very thrilling point.

2127
02:18:25,790 --> 02:18:28,190
And Vijay Shekhawat
will take the strike.

2128
02:18:28,260 --> 02:18:30,160
Vijay! Vijay!

2129
02:18:30,262 --> 02:18:31,559
He is hurt.

2130
02:18:36,501 --> 02:18:40,801
But it seems like he
can't see properly.

2131
02:18:41,539 --> 02:18:46,135
Absolutely Maninder, whenever you
sustain injury on the forehead...

2132
02:18:46,211 --> 02:18:50,409
...you often lose focus on the ball.

2133
02:18:50,482 --> 02:18:52,143
And the way he's shaking his head...

2134
02:18:52,217 --> 02:18:54,811
...there surely seems
to be some problem.

2135
02:18:55,220 --> 02:18:56,744
Four runs required in three balls.

2136
02:18:56,821 --> 02:18:58,152
So, Brett Lee is ready to bowl...

2137
02:18:58,223 --> 02:18:59,485
...to Vijay Shekhawat.

2138
02:18:59,557 --> 02:19:02,492
He tried to play a swap shot.

2139
02:19:02,560 --> 02:19:04,687
But was fortunate as it didn't
hit the outside edge of his bat.

2140
02:19:05,163 --> 02:19:06,187
No runs.

2141
02:19:06,298 --> 02:19:07,560
And he's angry with himself.

2142
02:19:07,599 --> 02:19:09,794
Seems like he couldn't see the ball.

2143
02:19:09,868 --> 02:19:12,234
And Mike Hussey noticed that too.

2144
02:19:12,570 --> 02:19:16,597
R. P Singh has returned, ask him,
whether he is fine or not.

2145
02:19:19,844 --> 02:19:21,709
Brett, I don't think
he can see properly.

2146
02:19:21,913 --> 02:19:23,608
Something wrong with
his vision. Fix it up.

2147
02:19:24,783 --> 02:19:28,184
Indian team needs
four runs off two balls.

2148
02:19:28,620 --> 02:19:33,114
And I know, that
every Indian is praying...

2149
02:19:33,191 --> 02:19:36,251
...that Vijay
Shekhawat makes India win.

2150
02:19:36,761 --> 02:19:38,752
Fifth ball of Brett Lee's over.

2151
02:19:40,265 --> 02:19:41,425
And he missed it again.

2152
02:19:42,534 --> 02:19:44,399
I think he cannot get
in the line of the ball.

2153
02:19:44,469 --> 02:19:46,130
The way he hit sixes before...

2154
02:19:46,204 --> 02:19:49,571
...his body language clearly shows
that he can't see the ball clearly.

2155
02:19:49,641 --> 02:19:51,768
Micheal Hussey is a
very smart player.

2156
02:19:51,843 --> 02:19:54,311
He's surely spoken
to Bret Lee about it.

2157
02:19:54,813 --> 02:19:56,542
Hey Brett, I'm sure he can't see.

2158
02:19:57,148 --> 02:19:58,206
Go for it. Okay!

2159
02:19:58,283 --> 02:19:59,341
Let's go.

2160
02:19:59,417 --> 02:20:04,684
Viju, last one. The last ball, Viju.
What are you thinking?

2161
02:20:05,657 --> 02:20:06,715
Go, good luck.

2162
02:20:12,897 --> 02:20:19,234
V for Viju! V for Victory!

2163
02:20:23,174 --> 02:20:25,369
'You know why I named you Vijay.

2164
02:20:27,445 --> 02:20:30,312
Last ball. It's an
extremely tense situation.

2165
02:20:30,582 --> 02:20:33,176
India needs four
runs to win this match.

2166
02:21:08,420 --> 02:21:09,478
That's a six!

2167
02:21:09,554 --> 02:21:12,216
And India wins the
Airtel Champions Trophy.

2168
02:21:12,290 --> 02:21:15,487
We won!

2169
02:21:15,894 --> 02:21:19,796
Uncle, Viju has made us victorious.

2170
02:22:01,806 --> 02:22:04,206
Hi, today morning someone
told me Vijay means Victory...

2171
02:22:04,275 --> 02:22:07,608
...in hindi, keep
it up, see you soon.

2172
02:22:12,684 --> 02:22:13,742
Uncle!

2173
02:22:15,553 --> 02:22:17,953
Uncle, we have won
the Champions trophy!

2174
02:22:19,757 --> 02:22:20,815
Where are you going, Uncle?

2175
02:22:36,841 --> 02:22:41,778
Long live Vijay Shekhawat!

2176
02:22:41,846 --> 02:22:43,245
Long live Vijay Shekhawat!

2177
02:22:44,849 --> 02:22:46,646
Long live.

2178
02:23:08,273 --> 02:23:10,468
Father...

2179
02:23:17,549 --> 02:23:18,709
Forgive me now.

2180
02:24:15,206 --> 02:24:16,264
Father...

2181
02:24:16,341 --> 02:24:18,707
My son has returned to me.

2182
02:24:23,314 --> 02:24:25,305
My son, Viju!

2183
02:24:44,469 --> 02:24:45,527
Father!

2184
02:24:47,572 --> 02:24:48,630
Father!

2185
02:24:53,911 --> 02:25:04,583
Father!

2186
02:25:07,725 --> 02:25:10,523
'Maybe, dad's redemption
was in my redemption.'

2187
02:25:41,326 --> 02:25:45,160
'Father, I give you the credit
for every run scored off my bat... '

2188
02:25:45,196 --> 02:25:48,188
'... and every moment
spent on the pitch.'

2189
02:25:49,200 --> 02:25:53,660
"Festivals come..."

2190
02:25:54,238 --> 02:25:57,833
"...once in a year."

2191
02:25:58,643 --> 02:26:02,909
"When the festival
of cricket comes..."

2192
02:26:03,381 --> 02:26:09,843
"...it doesn't go away."

2193
02:26:11,189 --> 02:26:14,716
"Break free! India
wants to break free!"

2194
02:26:17,729 --> 02:26:21,221
"Pick the bat and hit a six."

2195
02:26:21,399 --> 02:26:25,392
"Pick the bat and hit a six."

2196
02:26:25,603 --> 02:26:32,873
"Pump up the adrenaline."

2197
02:26:33,211 --> 02:26:39,810
"Pick the bat and hit a six."

2198
02:26:39,884 --> 02:26:43,411
"Cricket is our life, says India."

2199
02:26:43,488 --> 02:26:47,288
"Cricket is our life, says India."

2200
02:26:47,558 --> 02:26:50,891
"We love cricket. We love the game."

2201
02:26:51,195 --> 02:26:54,653
"Cricket is our life,
it's our fame."

2202
02:26:54,699 --> 02:26:58,226
"Cricket is our life, says India."

2203
02:26:58,302 --> 02:27:02,295
"Cricket is our life, says India."

2204
02:27:02,373 --> 02:27:05,638
"We love cricket. We love the game."

2205
02:27:05,843 --> 02:27:09,301
"Cricket is our life,
it's our fame."

2206
02:27:09,380 --> 02:27:16,843
"Cricket is our life, says India."

2207
02:27:22,393 --> 02:27:25,157
"Come on and play."

2208
02:27:29,534 --> 02:27:32,469
"Come on and play."

2209
02:27:38,810 --> 02:27:40,209
"There's cricket here, there's
cricket there.

2210
02:27:40,278 --> 02:27:42,212
Cricket is everywhere."

2211
02:27:46,217 --> 02:27:48,151
"Cricket in the sunny days,
or in the winter."

2212
02:27:48,219 --> 02:27:49,481
"Cricket even during the monsoon."

2213
02:27:53,491 --> 02:27:55,152
"Cricket in the villages...
Cricket in the cities."

2214
02:27:55,226 --> 02:27:56,750
"Cricket on the fields."

2215
02:27:56,794 --> 02:28:00,355
"If there are no fields,
then play cricket on the roofs."

2216
02:28:00,398 --> 02:28:03,834
"Cricket is our life, says India."

2217
02:28:03,901 --> 02:28:07,701
"Cricket is our life, says India."

2218
02:28:08,172 --> 02:28:11,505
"We love cricket. We love the game."

2219
02:28:11,776 --> 02:28:18,648
"Cricket is our life,
it's our fame."

02:28:18,716 --> 02:28:22,345
"Cricket is our life, says India."

02:28:22,720 --> 02:28:25,780
"We love cricket. We love the game."

"Cricket is our life,
it's our fame."

"Cricket is our life,
it's our fame."

2224
02:28:42,740 --> 02:28:45,538
"Come on and play."

2225
02:28:50,147 --> 02:28:52,741
"Come on and play."

02:28:57,421 --> 02:29:00,322
"Come on and play."
