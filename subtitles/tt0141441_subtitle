3
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:24,220
Raise your veil (illusion),
you'll find your beloved

4
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:54,320
The Lord resides
in every living creature

5
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:06,269
Don't speak ill of anyone,
you'll find your beloved

6
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:13,680
Raise your veil,
you'll find your beloved

7
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,820
Flaunt not this wealth and your youth

8
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:47,770
All this is worthless,
you'll find your beloved

9
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:55,060
Raise your veil,
you'll find your beloved

10
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:17,200
In the silent temple...

11
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:21,959
When lighting a lamp
in the silent temple...

12
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:31,040
don't think of anything else

13
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:34,130
You'll find your beloved

14
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:41,240
Raise your veil,
you'll find your beloved

15
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:52,490
When my footsteps never hesitated
to enter a courtesan's house...

16
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,260
why do they halt
when I enter a temple?

17
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,470
Anyone who sees me
will definitely wonder...

18
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,980
what an atheist is doing here.

19
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:42,630
Who? Mr. Vijay?
Why are you here?

20
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,620
I just came.

21
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:43,200
Oh, soul, you're an atheist,
but such a sinner.

22
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:47,940
People feel spiritual on
hearing her devotional songs...

23
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:51,730
but you look at her
with lustful eyes.

24
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:25,670
Aunt! Aunt, did you
say something? Aunt!

25
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,680
Vijay, what I was saying was...

26
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:50,630
this small house is the legacy
of our forefathers.

27
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:54,200
How much money will you
get by selling this?

28
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,969
And if you don't sell this,
then perhaps you'll...

29
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:04,750
have an excuse to
visit once in a while.

30
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:08,580
Okay, Aunt. If you're upset,
then I'll not sell it.

31
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,400
Tomorrow or the day after,
I'll return to Bombay.

32
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:21,180
Aunt, take the milk.

33
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:24,810
Mangu, bring it inside.

34
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,580
Bring it inside.

35
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,400
Give it to me.

36
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:47,980
Look here, Mangu. Bring the
milk earlier from tomorrow.

37
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,550
Vijay asks for tea as
soon as he wakes up. Okay?

38
00:08:55,430 --> 00:09:00,170
Aunt, what can I do?
I have to do so many things.

39
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:04,610
Early morning I've to warm the
milk for the female mendicant.

40
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,690
That's why I get delayed.

41
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,600
No, Mangu. You must not
trouble yourself so much.

42
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,089
Look here. From tomorrow,
I'll wake up late...

43
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:15,110
and have my tea late, too. Okay?

44
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,980
So should I sit at
home for you all day?

45
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:21,970
Shouldn't I go to the temple?

46
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,859
Aunt, the Gods and Goddesses...

47
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,500
wait for their devotees all day.

48
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,100
Those poor souls don't even sleep.

49
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,089
Look here, sir. Don't make
fun of the Gods and Goddesses.

50
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:35,290
Hey!

51
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,119
Okay, Aunt, I'm going.

52
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:44,930
He's an atheist.
He'd understand only if he'd...

53
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:46,930
have attended some
religious discourses.

54
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,250
Oh, the one with the flute...

55
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:00,230
Viju, look here.
Come home in time for your lunch.

56
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:05,150
Aunt, are you going to
arrange someone's alliance?

57
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:08,199
No, I've stopped doing all this.

58
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,740
I'll go to the temple to
hear the religious discourse.

59
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,240
Does the mendicant
really narrate well?

60
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:19,189
I told you. As it is
you're an atheist.

61
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:21,530
How are you concerned
about the religious discourses?

62
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,690
Aunt, I'm not as staunch
an atheist as you think.

63
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:32,520
If I come across a real sage,
I'll definitely change.

64
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:37,040
Really? Then, tonight,
do come and...

65
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,670
listen to Meera Devi's
devotional song.

66
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,760
And from childhood...

67
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,670
Meera considered Giridhar
Gopal her husband...

68
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:50,180
and always sang:

69
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:02,390
I want to go to Giridhar's house

70
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,650
Giridhar is my only beloved

71
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:15,800
His beauty is enchanting

72
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,920
I want to go to Giridhar's house

73
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:39,560
Our love is eternal

74
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:43,270
I can't stay without him

75
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:53,570
Whatever he gives me,
that attire I wear

76
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:01,260
Whatever he gives me, I eat

77
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,580
I want to go to Giridhar's house

78
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:37,230
I'll sit wherever he seats me

79
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,060
I leave myself to his will

80
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:50,960
Giridhar is Meera's Lord

81
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:57,460
I can bestow my life on him

82
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,840
I'll go to Giridhar's house

83
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,650
Gangu's mother, please wait.

84
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:42,670
- Mangu!
- Coming!

85
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,400
Mother!

86
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:58,370
- Devi!
- You seem to be a stranger.

87
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:02,380
No. I was born in this village.

88
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,970
No man is allowed to come
for the afternoon discourse.

89
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:08,610
I didn't know that.

90
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:11,320
Then why have you come?
To listen to the discourse?

91
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:15,290
No. To talk to you.

92
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:18,880
I don't talk to men.

93
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:24,590
It's possible, but...

94
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,400
What do you wish to know?

95
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,079
The reason you became a
mendicant at this age?

96
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:37,670
Reason? I found
the world too simple.

97
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:43,310
Forgive me, but I can't
believe that you left...

98
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:46,610
worldly pleasures
on the sages' advice.

99
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:48,730
Why don't you believe it?

100
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:51,970
The pain that's hidden in your eyes.

101
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:58,400
Devi! Devi, forgive me that I've...

102
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,810
Today, you've committed a mistake.
Don't do it again.

103
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:41,880
Mangu! Man...

104
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,800
- Will you do one thing?
- Sure.

105
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:56,590
Go and call the guard.

106
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,016
Order me, I'll myself...

107
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,120
I want to call the guard
to throw you out.

108
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:03,750
What's my mistake?

109
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,700
You're violating the rules here.

110
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,900
Is it a crime to sit under a tree?

111
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:18,860
Why do you... why do you...

112
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:24,490
I'll be obliged if
you leave here.

113
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,460
I'll play the ball
with Kanha, with Krishna

114
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:51,000
With Yashoda's dark son

115
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:17,420
My mother shouts
if I play in the courtyard

116
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:26,810
My brother pouts
if I play in the alleys

117
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:30,909
On Jamuna's banks,
Kanhaiya will steal this

118
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,990
Who will I play ball with, tell me?

119
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:42,860
Ah, I'll play with Radha

120
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:00,629
Uncle, you and here?

121
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:05,409
Mangu, when I was small
I used to play here, too.

122
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:07,130
- Really?
- Yes. - Then play.

123
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,526
Mangu, you wear those
saffron clothes, too.

124
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:29,350
Do you wish to
become a mendicant, too?

125
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:32,320
No. These clothes are Meera Devi's.

126
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,620
Uncle, have you heard Devi's songs?

127
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,899
She sings well, very sweet.

128
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,660
If you wish,
I'll hear her sometime.

129
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:43,840
Why sometime? Come today. Today.

130
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:47,300
- Okay.
- Okay.

131
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:49,710
Uncle, give me back my doll!

132
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:51,959
Here.

133
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:10,260
I'm crazy in love.
No one knows my pain

134
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:36,280
I sleep on a bed of thorns

135
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:45,350
I've sleepless nights

136
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:54,820
My beloved dwells in the sky

137
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:03,600
How can we unite?

138
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:06,450
No one knows my pain

139
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:14,460
I'm crazy in love.
No one knows my pain

140
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:40,110
Only one who's
wounded can know the pain

141
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:49,010
No one else can understand it

142
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:58,750
Meera's pain will ebb
when she unites with her Lord

143
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:10,510
No one knows my pain

144
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:18,420
I'm crazy in love.
No one knows my pain

145
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,980
I would be obliged if
you stop coming here.

146
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:01,610
The entire village comes to
hear your devotional songs.

147
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:06,129
But I get disturbed
on seeing you here.

148
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:11,370
Today, for the first time,
I looked up while singing.

149
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:22,840
If my coming here
troubles you, then I won't come.

150
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:25,270
How many days will you
stay in the village?

151
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,600
I was to return in a day or two.

152
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:34,030
But after I saw you...

153
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:39,186
After listening to
your devotional songs...

154
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:41,120
I decided to stay
on a few more days.

155
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:43,240
Then why don't you sit
with all the others?

156
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,700
Why do you hide?

157
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:48,620
The entire village
knows that I'm an atheist.

158
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,200
Then you come
here to listen to music?

159
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:54,850
No. To see you.

160
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,320
Don't come from tomorrow.

161
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,700
Is this your order?

162
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:08,100
No. Just a request.

163
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,560
Can't you see? At every step
you're breaking my rules.

164
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,940
The rule of not talking to men.

165
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:31,280
I didn't mean to break your
rules or shatter your peace.

166
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:36,110
Will you mind if I do something
for my peace of mind...

167
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:39,690
- without coming before you?
- No!

168
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,540
You cannot have
forgotten Anjani.

169
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:09,676
Or that evening when I...

170
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,700
took you to her house for the first time.

171
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:16,080
Hesitantly, the way
you entered her house...

172
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:35,710
Why do you lock eyes with me?

173
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:44,386
Oh, stranger, oh, beloved...

174
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:47,600
why do you lock eyes with me?

175
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:10,070
Our eyes met and
my heart was wounded

176
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:18,470
Who was the culprit
and who was slain?

177
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:26,830
The ones who loved you
were in a terrible state

178
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:34,919
Living wasn't easy
but death was difficult, too

179
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:39,346
Oh, stranger, oh, beloved

180
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:42,669
Why do you lock eyes with me?

181
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:08,920
I have fallen prey to your charm

182
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:16,790
Calming my heart though I'm restless

183
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:23,900
Eyes cast down, I wait expectantly

184
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:31,730
Helpless, I sit before you

185
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,826
Oh, stranger, oh, beloved

186
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:39,149
Why do you lock eyes with me?

187
00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:05,710
If you've resided in my heart,
then be my love

188
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:14,000
Like eternal spring in a garden

189
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:22,090
Be my peace and my happiness

190
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:30,540
Be a beautiful
remembrance of our love

191
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:34,856
Oh, stranger, oh, beloved

192
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,020
Why do you lock eyes with me?

193
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,800
Lovely!

194
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,159
Come on, get up, my dear.

195
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:47,990
Why did I have to cage a free bird?

196
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:53,220
- Raj, that's not it.
- Then what is it?

197
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:56,220
Anjani has stopped
festivities at night...

198
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,430
and you, you mope every night.

199
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,560
Look here, Raj.
A man and woman...

200
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:06,920
don't always have the relationship
that people assume.

201
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,000
Sometimes, it's just a
lingering attraction.

202
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:13,770
Whatever you say, my friend...

203
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,626
But when Anjani sings...

204
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:20,440
she's restless at night,
then she means what we're thinking.

205
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:45,666
What does he know...

206
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:50,490
of the plight of one
who has lost her sleep?

207
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:07,326
Why there are always tears in my eyes?

208
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:12,490
Why is my life so disturbed?

209
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:31,580
Why are my quivering lips silent?

210
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,470
Why is my heart's
desire so suppressed?

211
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:53,960
He always comes and troubles me

212
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:03,419
What does he know
of the state of my heart?

213
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:24,320
What does he know
of the plight of the one...

214
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:29,550
who has lost her sleep?

215
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:44,790
Those whose days
pass peacefully...

216
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,560
and can sleep peacefully at night

217
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:11,909
A heart wounded by love...

218
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:20,130
What does he know
of the plight of a wounded heart?

219
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:42,290
What does he know
of the plight of the one...

220
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:47,409
who has lost her sleep?

221
00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:00,480
Great! Everything
happens in reverse here.

222
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:03,300
Vijay should be offering
flowers at your feet.

223
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,520
He is my lord.

224
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:08,259
I am his devotee.

225
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:12,069
Great! Nicely said.

226
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:15,859
So the lord comes to
your house to be worshipped?

227
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:25,139
And that too in such a place
where great sages have failed.

228
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,500
Greetings, Gurudev!

229
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,060
Greetings, Maharaj!

230
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:31,710
Mr. Vijay, won't you greet him?

231
00:34:32,449 --> 00:34:34,719
The Lord never bows before anyone.

232
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,299
Hello, Lord.

233
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:41,260
Forgive me, sage,
but people call me an atheist.

234
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,760
So, then I, too, am
an atheist like you.

235
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,800
I, too, am in search of the Lord.

236
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:47,929
In the hearts of the poor...

237
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:49,610
in the huts of the hopeless...

238
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:51,810
and in the hearts of
such helpless women.

239
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:56,310
So, now we know the
reason for you coming here.

240
00:34:56,510 --> 00:35:02,050
My son, some come here
attracted by desire and lust.

241
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:04,520
He comes, he degrades himself...

242
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:06,220
and becomes worse than a devil.

243
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:10,720
But some come here
and become God...

244
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:12,550
and are worshipped.

245
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,280
Are you mocking me too?

246
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,520
No, great one.

247
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:20,529
Look here, sage;
I am neither a great man nor God.

248
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:25,020
Our Vijay is an aesthete.

249
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:28,330
Mr. Vijay, you are a great soul.

250
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:31,610
You have thought
that God does not exist.

251
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,800
But what is God?

252
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:35,510
Truth, mind and happiness.

253
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,839
This is how you identify God.

254
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:40,710
You see God everywhere
and in every form.

255
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,900
You don't even visit the temple...

256
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:45,799
yet you come here to my mother
to see the Lord

257
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:50,960
Gurudev, you taught me
to not be a prostitute.

258
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:55,980
But when my mother forced
me, I was quite fortunate...

259
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:59,160
that Mr. Vijay
stopped me from doing that.

260
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:03,230
Oh, noble man; your soul
is in search of someone.

261
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:05,690
You say that you're an atheist...

262
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,259
but one day you'll be
the one who will find God.

263
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:12,100
One day the Lord will
reside in your heart.

264
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:13,850
Greetings, Gurudev!

265
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:15,819
Hail, Satchitanand!

266
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:34,500
Om, Lord, give me peace.

267
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:55,830
- Sir!
- Mangu...

268
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,566
you've come so early
in the morning to wash clothes?

269
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:00,840
Yes, they'd piled up
for the last two days.

270
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,520
So, I'm washing them today.

271
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:04,020
Meera Devi is sick.

272
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:07,570
Meera Devi is sick?

273
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:12,650
That's why I haven't
seen her for two days.

274
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:14,340
Yes. She's down with a fever.

275
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:20,549
Mangu...

276
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,839
how do you look after her?

277
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,640
What can I do?

278
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:27,710
As she's sick, I wash her clothes.

279
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:30,506
I warm her milk.
I listen to her speak...

280
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:32,130
and keep looking at her face.

281
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:34,240
What does she talk to you about?

282
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:38,216
She says, Mangu,
do not ever dream.

283
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,689
I ask her why?

284
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,910
So, she says dreams are fake.

285
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:44,710
People who dream
are often disappointed.

286
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:48,169
And sir?

287
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:50,730
I see dreams everyday.
What should I do?

288
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,756
- Give, I'll wring it out for you.
No, sir!

289
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,670
You cannot touch
a mendicant's clothes.

290
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:32,310
The doors to
my heart have opened

291
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:45,140
But my beloved has
still not arrived

292
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:53,130
Has still not arrived

293
00:42:58,430 --> 00:43:01,509
Aunt, is there any doctor
or physician in the village?

294
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:04,680
Viju, what happened?
Do you have a headache?

295
00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:07,279
Do you have a stomach ache?
A fever?

296
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,500
Yes, I have a fever.

297
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:13,460
Viju, all night you
were wandering outside.

298
00:43:13,770 --> 00:43:16,350
Sleep on the bed. I'll
immediately call the doctor.

299
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:17,569
Okay?

300
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:20,850
- Aunt, I don't have a fever.
- Then?

301
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:24,490
- Meera Devi has a fever!
- That mendicant?

302
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:26,770
I'll immediately go
and call the physician.

303
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:33,110
But Viju, how did you come to know?

304
00:43:34,990 --> 00:43:36,390
Mangu was telling me.

305
00:43:57,790 --> 00:44:00,840
Devi, now I have become
very sensible.

306
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:03,500
Father has told me clearly.

307
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:09,660
Oh, Lord Krishna,
please come to our country.

308
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:16,710
Devi, this morning when I went to
wash your clothes, I met sir there.

309
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,520
I told him that Devi has a high fever.

310
00:44:19,730 --> 00:44:22,430
He asked me who looks after you.

311
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,460
I told him I look after you.
Me!

312
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:25,800
Who else will?

313
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:30,069
I warm her clothes.
No, no, I wash her clothes.

314
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:31,540
I warm the milk.

315
00:44:31,850 --> 00:44:33,690
I listen to her speak and...

316
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:36,770
- Devi, are you listening to me?
- Yes.

317
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:45,290
Oh, Lord Krishna,
please come to our country.

318
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:50,160
Devi, you never
listen to me. I'm going.

319
00:45:03,130 --> 00:45:06,100
Father, Devi still has a fever...

320
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,100
and doesn't take her medicine.

321
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:09,819
Then how will her fever ebb?

322
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,560
Now who will make her understand?

323
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:15,700
I keep telling all the
children that I look after Devi.

324
00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:17,790
Father, you, too, are very stubborn.

325
00:45:18,130 --> 00:45:20,500
Many times I have
forbidden you, but whenever I look...

326
00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:22,609
you're smoking this hookah.

327
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:05,350
How did she know I was here?

328
00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:20,740
You? At this time?

329
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:27,620
I always come here at night...

330
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:31,180
to listen to your devotional songs.

331
00:46:38,950 --> 00:46:41,040
Why do you put these flowers
on my doorstep?

332
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:45,899
Why are you carrying them with you?

333
00:46:50,330 --> 00:46:52,330
I've brought them
to immerse in the river.

334
00:46:58,270 --> 00:47:01,100
What if someone sees these
rose petals on my doorstep?

335
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:09,520
Not you perhaps, but your
flowers will disturb my peace.

336
00:47:11,430 --> 00:47:13,990
Is that why you keep chanting
the mantra, for your peace of mind?

337
00:47:16,350 --> 00:47:21,910
When, despite years of austerity,
my mind is disturbed...

338
00:47:23,730 --> 00:47:28,590
I chant the peace mantra.

339
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:35,620
Devi...

340
00:47:41,990 --> 00:47:44,029
can you forget everything
just by meditating?

341
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:48,460
Everything. Even God.

342
00:47:50,390 --> 00:47:51,990
But only if you do penance...

343
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:54,480
with great concentration
of the mind and the heart...

344
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,160
You have really controlled
your heart.

345
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:06,260
You didn't come before me
for three days.

346
00:48:09,330 --> 00:48:10,830
Wasn't that what you wished?

347
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:15,360
If you wish, you can
come to the temple.

348
00:48:17,390 --> 00:48:18,890
May I ask you something?

349
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:22,930
I'm talking to you like
this and at this hour.

350
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:25,820
What if someone sees us?

351
00:48:26,350 --> 00:48:27,850
Are you scared of people?

352
00:48:33,030 --> 00:48:36,580
Not of people, but of you.

353
00:48:40,490 --> 00:48:43,399
I don't know why, but I feel like
talking to you again and again.

354
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:47,259
I lose my peace of mind.

355
00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:50,000
Is it a sin if two people talk?

356
00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:52,990
Our conversations aren't related
to the religious scriptures.

357
00:48:56,370 --> 00:48:59,130
Doesn't humanity allow
sympathizing with anyone?

358
00:49:06,870 --> 00:49:08,730
The one who renounces
the world doesn't need...

359
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:11,930
compassion or sympathy.

360
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:16,140
Joys and sorrow depend on our Karma.

361
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:19,070
You cannot escape them.

362
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:24,660
I want to know
why you renounced the world.

363
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:27,819
Why did you become an ascetic?

364
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:30,460
What will you gain
by knowing the reason?

365
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:33,270
My mind will be at peace.

366
00:49:35,470 --> 00:49:38,520
Day and night this
thought keeps tormenting me.

367
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:42,669
Then listen.

368
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:46,600
I was the daughter of a landlord.

369
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:50,850
Father would always be
worried about the debts.

370
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:53,790
Brother would always be drunk.

371
00:49:55,390 --> 00:49:59,029
And I, I would dream
of a fantasy world.

372
00:50:00,110 --> 00:50:07,070
I would sing, dance and play
with complete abandon.

373
00:50:09,170 --> 00:50:13,480
Music and poetry were my passion.

374
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:40,410
The moon plays hide and
seek with the clouds...

375
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:43,029
on the banks of the river

376
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:48,140
The bride plays Holi
in the month of Phagun

377
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:55,990
Oh, beloved, don't mock me

378
00:51:03,990 --> 00:51:06,569
The moon plays hide and seek

379
00:51:14,410 --> 00:51:16,920
The beautiful fair maiden...

380
00:51:17,010 --> 00:51:20,900
The beautiful fair
maiden said to her beloved

381
00:51:26,110 --> 00:51:27,410
See, my beloved

382
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,290
The moon plays hide and
seek with the clouds...

383
00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:46,839
on the banks of the river

384
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:08,720
The stars were dancing

385
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:19,310
The clouds sulkily went away

386
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,210
See, my beloved

387
00:52:42,590 --> 00:52:45,110
The moon plays hide and
seek with the clouds...

388
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:47,730
on the banks of the river

389
00:53:01,090 --> 00:53:03,090
See my beloved. See my beloved

390
00:53:03,130 --> 00:53:04,630
Surabhi, you keep saying this.

391
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:07,730
But do you know
what a beloved means?

392
00:53:08,290 --> 00:53:11,270
Yes. I know very well.

393
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:19,780
A very big beard.
A Long tail. Long ears.

394
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:23,020
And small horns on the head.

395
00:53:24,790 --> 00:53:28,730
Listen, Surabhi. You always
make fun about your beloved.

396
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:31,970
So many good
proposals were shown to you.

397
00:53:33,070 --> 00:53:34,770
But you didn't like any of them.

398
00:53:35,650 --> 00:53:37,050
Look, I'm telling you...

399
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,610
you'll never get the man
of your dreams.

400
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:41,320
If this continues...

401
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:43,279
you'll remain a spinster all your life.

402
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:45,860
Did you hear what I said?

403
00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:47,046
Yes.

404
00:53:47,070 --> 00:53:49,650
My dear poetess, will you
always play with the stars...

405
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:52,220
Be happy with the moon
and fly in the sky?

406
00:53:52,570 --> 00:53:54,570
Or will you at times
listen to us as well?

407
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:56,970
I will hear. I will hear.

408
00:54:01,910 --> 00:54:04,180
Surabhi! Surabhi!
Are you listening?

409
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:08,830
The wedding procession has arrived
and the groom is waiting.

410
00:54:09,370 --> 00:54:10,470
Groom?

411
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,520
Yes, there is a wedding.

412
00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:19,246
Whose?

413
00:54:19,270 --> 00:54:22,160
Neither mine nor yours.
But Pushpa's doll is getting married.

414
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,750
This is the groom?
An animal with a beard and a tail?

415
00:54:44,590 --> 00:54:46,090
And he'll marry Pushpa's doll?

416
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:47,540
Throw him away.

417
00:54:48,110 --> 00:54:49,810
Then will my doll remain a spinster?

418
00:54:49,930 --> 00:54:51,500
Yes, she will remain. Till...

419
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:03,410
Just look at our beautiful bride.

420
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:06,260
Our dear daughter is
like a deer in a forest,

421
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:07,886
the cuckoo in the garden,

422
00:55:07,910 --> 00:55:09,710
As graceful as a swan on the lake.

423
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:11,730
The groom who weds her...

424
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:14,919
will be a swan himself;

425
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:22,610
handsome as the moon,
a poet weaving dreams, or a painter.

426
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:26,860
Is a groom being selected
for this doll or for you?

427
00:55:28,350 --> 00:55:30,990
Listen, Surabhi.
Dreams always shatter.

428
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,990
People who weave dreams
are often disappointed.

429
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:36,700
You search for the
man of your dreams...

430
00:55:36,730 --> 00:55:38,960
but you aren't interested
in getting married.

431
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:54,080
The doors of my heart are open

432
00:55:59,350 --> 00:56:07,350
My beloved didn't come

433
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:16,279
Didn't come

434
00:56:16,930 --> 00:56:22,310
Oh friend, my beloved didn't come

435
00:56:52,870 --> 00:56:58,236
Clouds thundered but still...

436
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:06,260
Clouds thundered but still
the peacock didn't come to dance

437
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:11,860
Oh friend, my beloved didn't come

438
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:37,259
Oh, bee look,
the orchards are blooming

439
00:57:42,590 --> 00:57:47,480
You keep searching
for nectar far and wide

440
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:52,500
What mistake have I made?

441
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:58,470
Why don't you come towards me?

442
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:03,140
Oh friend, my beloved didn't come

443
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:30,680
Why're you laughing?

444
00:58:31,350 --> 00:58:34,220
This painting hasn't been
completed for months.

445
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:38,520
A brush in place of a sword,
a flower instead of a shield...

446
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:42,089
and look at his face! '?'

447
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:46,170
- What's the meaning of '?'
- You won't understand.

448
00:58:48,310 --> 00:58:49,940
His looks must be unique...

449
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:52,200
And...

450
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:54,400
And are you leaving or not?

451
00:58:54,490 --> 00:58:55,790
I'm going, ma'am!

452
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:11,980
Sir, Holi is approaching.
Shouldn't we celebrate?

453
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:14,120
I know, Raghu.

454
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:21,029
- Why ask me?
- Sir, you are our master.

455
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:25,180
Ask junior master,
he takes care of business.

456
00:59:26,570 --> 00:59:29,030
The festival of Holi has come.
We'll celebrate.

457
00:59:29,110 --> 00:59:30,710
This time we'll do Holi justice.

458
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:33,340
But, junior master, I'm asking
for the expenses.

459
00:59:33,890 --> 00:59:36,490
- How will it happen and from where?
- From where?

460
00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:38,710
Is that my job? Come on, go.

461
00:59:40,330 --> 00:59:45,750
I just know that this time
Holi will be nice, very nice.

462
00:59:47,010 --> 00:59:49,220
But the only worry is for money.

463
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:53,030
Sir, the money can be easily arranged...

464
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:55,060
- if you listen to me.
- Speak.

465
00:59:55,410 --> 00:59:59,009
- Agree to Thakur Padam Singh's proposal.
- Then?

466
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:01,940
Then an amount of Rs. 500,000
is in our hands.

467
01:00:04,070 --> 01:00:08,250
- It's a little less.
- Make senior master agree to this alliance...

468
01:00:08,870 --> 01:00:10,370
and the amount will increase.

469
01:00:36,890 --> 01:00:41,230
Play with colors,
play with colors, dear

470
01:00:41,730 --> 01:00:46,210
Festive days have come

471
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:10,670
Fill up with color,
oh new player

472
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:18,520
Shoot the water gun
and drench the sari

473
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:26,370
The whole body is colored

474
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:34,170
The whole body is colored,
playful days have come

475
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:38,990
Play with colors,
play with colors, dear

476
01:01:39,310 --> 01:01:43,850
Festive days are here

477
01:02:04,810 --> 01:02:07,980
The bride is shy behind her veil

478
01:02:09,670 --> 01:02:15,760
The bride is shy behind her veil.
Her sweetheart resides in her eyes

479
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:23,920
The koel coos and says...

480
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:31,730
the days of our youth are here

481
01:02:32,050 --> 01:02:36,600
Play with colors,
play with colors, dear

482
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:41,340
Festive days are here

483
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:04,080
The beloved has lost body and heart

484
01:03:08,780 --> 01:03:11,960
The lake of beauty is overflowing

485
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:19,540
Thirsting eyes say...

486
01:03:23,030 --> 01:03:27,470
the robbing days have come

487
01:03:27,730 --> 01:03:32,310
Play with colors,
play with colors, dear

488
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:36,940
Festive days have come

489
01:04:00,220 --> 01:04:03,330
- Who, who are you?
- Thakur Padam Singh.

490
01:04:09,940 --> 01:04:13,910
- She's a fairy.
- Let's go, junior master is waiting for you.

491
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:28,580
- Hey, what happened?
- Saw him?

492
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:31,730
- Who?
- The man who came to marry Pushpa's doll.

493
01:04:31,770 --> 01:04:33,340
- Really?
- Yes!

494
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:40,070
A long beard, long ears...
I threw color on that monkey.

495
01:04:52,710 --> 01:04:55,160
Thakur, you've been enjoying.

496
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:57,670
You celebrated Holi?
Where? With whom?

497
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:03,310
I was coming. On the way...

498
01:05:04,130 --> 01:05:05,300
Welcome, welcome.

499
01:05:11,990 --> 01:05:13,910
So, what did you think
about this matter, Father?

500
01:05:14,260 --> 01:05:18,450
What can I say?
We should ask Surabhi about this.

501
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:21,439
Surabhi? When did Surabhi
ever like anyone?

502
01:05:21,860 --> 01:05:23,560
Whenever she was asked she said no.

503
01:05:23,860 --> 01:05:26,790
She won't say yes even
when she turns sixty.

504
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:30,560
Then why are you asking me?
Do what you think is right.

505
01:05:48,580 --> 01:05:50,170
Do understand...

506
01:05:54,530 --> 01:06:00,370
Do understand, oh monsoon

507
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:06,410
Let my beloved come,
let him come

508
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:16,280
Let my angry darling
settle matters for me

509
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:23,290
Do understand...

510
01:06:35,170 --> 01:06:40,940
I will adorn my
veil with lightning

511
01:06:48,220 --> 01:06:53,569
I will use black clouds
to make collyrium

512
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:09,480
The thundering of the clouds
will become...

513
01:07:16,610 --> 01:07:24,610
the beating of my heart

514
01:07:27,230 --> 01:07:35,230
I will weave your small droplets

515
01:07:41,070 --> 01:07:49,070
into a garland

516
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:54,970
To entice my sweetheart...

517
01:07:55,070 --> 01:08:02,940
To entice my sweetheart
let me weave dreams

518
01:08:03,130 --> 01:08:09,010
Do understand, oh monsoon

519
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:13,090
Let my beloved come

520
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:21,420
Do understand...

521
01:08:27,450 --> 01:08:30,920
You understand, Bimla?
Let my beloved come.

522
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:34,990
Hey, hey, look, look.

523
01:08:43,450 --> 01:08:45,955
This is the same monkey,
on whom I put color that day.

524
01:08:45,979 --> 01:08:49,899
- No, Surabhi. You shouldn't speak like that of him.
- Why?

525
01:08:50,439 --> 01:08:53,129
Because your brother has
fixed your alliance with him.

526
01:08:55,149 --> 01:08:57,279
- My brother has fixed my alliance with him?
- Yes.

527
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:10,279
Brother, have you made the deal?

528
01:09:11,010 --> 01:09:13,810
Surabhi, whatever I did
was for your well being.

529
01:09:13,930 --> 01:09:15,540
This is for my well being?

530
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:18,240
Father and I are able to
think about my well being.

531
01:09:19,069 --> 01:09:20,566
How will you understand, you drunkard!

532
01:09:20,590 --> 01:09:22,860
Surabhi, this marriage
will surely take place.

533
01:09:23,319 --> 01:09:25,450
It might have,
with some poor timid girl.

534
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:28,279
But I am Thakur Sher Singh's daughter.

535
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:31,160
So, then go to him.
Why are you irritating me?

536
01:09:42,770 --> 01:09:43,870
Father!

537
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:50,750
Dear, I know. But I'm helpless.

538
01:09:57,140 --> 01:10:02,560
Then, who else will help me?

539
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:05,990
And I can't even wipe your tears.

540
01:10:07,860 --> 01:10:11,960
God, you should have ended
my life before this day.

541
01:10:26,300 --> 01:10:29,160
Hunter

542
01:10:44,150 --> 01:10:48,650
Everyone is a hunter of beauty

543
01:10:53,460 --> 01:10:57,540
No one is a worshipper

544
01:11:08,380 --> 01:11:16,300
A beautiful woman
is stuck among palaces

545
01:11:17,110 --> 01:11:21,009
Through deceit, by force...

546
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:29,500
Through deceit, by force,
the hunter robs body, mind, and youth

547
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:34,420
Everyone is a hunter of beauty

548
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:49,130
Buds bloomed in the orchard,
and the hunter arrived

549
01:11:49,970 --> 01:11:54,770
He wasn't satisfied only by seeing...

550
01:11:56,840 --> 01:12:00,790
so he plucked all the buds

551
01:12:01,220 --> 01:12:05,260
Everyone is a hunter of beauty

552
01:12:11,980 --> 01:12:19,980
The beautiful deer was tired
of running in the woods

553
01:12:20,890 --> 01:12:28,890
On seeing her golden beauty,
the hunter gave chase

554
01:12:29,710 --> 01:12:33,860
Everyone is a hunter of beauty

555
01:12:49,180 --> 01:12:53,590
- Give me the fawn.
- Why did you shoot it?

556
01:12:53,620 --> 01:12:56,220
- I'm a hunter.
- You have no right to kill anything...

557
01:12:56,620 --> 01:12:58,490
or to snatch anyone's freedom.

558
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:00,420
Whether I have the right or not,
it's mine.

559
01:13:00,450 --> 01:13:03,790
- I won't give it. It has sought my protection.
- What's the dispute?

560
01:13:03,910 --> 01:13:05,820
- It's my prey.
- I saved it.

561
01:13:06,010 --> 01:13:08,220
The saviour has more
right than the killer.

562
01:13:15,090 --> 01:13:16,740
So, what have you decided?

563
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:22,770
- I won't go back.
- Then what will you do?

564
01:13:23,210 --> 01:13:29,390
The earth is huge. I'll find
a place somewhere or other.

565
01:13:30,860 --> 01:13:32,559
If you wish to stay here then...

566
01:13:33,180 --> 01:13:35,160
I find a lot of mental peace here.

567
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:40,430
- I wish to stay here forever.
- What do you mean?

568
01:13:41,650 --> 01:13:42,849
Initiate me.

569
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:46,940
I'll stay with junior mother.

570
01:13:47,530 --> 01:13:51,500
When the heart is wounded,
then the world seems worthless.

571
01:13:52,240 --> 01:13:53,639
But you are young.

572
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:57,260
Unfulfilled hopes,
suppressed desires...

573
01:13:57,970 --> 01:14:01,480
will trouble you,
make you restless.

574
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:03,480
I have no hopes...

575
01:14:04,820 --> 01:14:06,420
nor any desires in my heart.

576
01:14:07,300 --> 01:14:10,770
- You'll have to kill the heart.
- It has already died.

577
01:14:12,660 --> 01:14:16,389
Kindly allow me to devote
myself to God here.

578
01:14:17,130 --> 01:14:21,170
Then do this: you'll be given an
initiation for twelve months...

579
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:23,990
If you control over your heart...

580
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:26,580
if no worldly
illusions shake your faith...

581
01:14:27,370 --> 01:14:30,620
then after a year,
you'll be given the real initiation.

582
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,160
For a few days I stayed in
senior mother's monastery.

583
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:46,680
I found mental peace
with her advice.

584
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:51,380
The world seemed worthless
and I took up asceticism.

585
01:14:53,450 --> 01:14:56,059
Since then I keep
wandering in small villages...

586
01:14:56,090 --> 01:14:57,790
and unknown places
away from the city.

587
01:14:58,900 --> 01:15:00,500
I sing religious stories to people.

588
01:15:03,050 --> 01:15:05,440
And I devote my heart
to the service of God.

589
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:08,820
Now I understand.

590
01:15:10,110 --> 01:15:12,730
This pain in your eyes,
the deep melancholy...

591
01:15:14,110 --> 01:15:15,710
is a memorial of sweet dreams.

592
01:15:17,230 --> 01:15:18,629
It's a suppressed plea.

593
01:15:20,090 --> 01:15:22,400
You're able to read
me like an open book.

594
01:15:25,890 --> 01:15:27,880
I don't want to remember the past.

595
01:15:29,860 --> 01:15:31,360
And what's the use?

596
01:15:32,070 --> 01:15:35,120
Sharing your troubles
will relieve your mind.

597
01:15:36,660 --> 01:15:39,090
Before meeting you
I was at peace.

598
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:44,540
Only on the surface. lnside,
the embers were smothered by ash.

599
01:15:45,930 --> 01:15:47,430
But the fire blazed.

600
01:15:48,700 --> 01:15:51,710
I saw that fire in the
pain refllected in your eyes.

601
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:52,960
Stop it.

602
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:40,430
Viju, please come and
sit here. I sneezed.

603
01:16:40,630 --> 01:16:41,730
Aunt.

604
01:16:44,530 --> 01:16:48,110
Aunt, when you sneeze will
you fall asleep?

605
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:54,210
You're an atheist. You only know
how to talk but not work.

606
01:16:57,010 --> 01:16:58,610
What shall I do? The dishes?

607
01:16:59,370 --> 01:17:02,019
Shall I grind flour?
Light the stove?

608
01:17:03,150 --> 01:17:04,750
Tell me, what shall I do?

609
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:07,430
Viju, you're going to
the market, aren't you?

610
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:12,660
No. No, not to market.

611
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:17,470
- I'm going to Neelam Bagh.
- You'll have to walk a little.

612
01:17:19,670 --> 01:17:20,970
Not now, Aunt.

613
01:17:21,580 --> 01:17:24,170
Then should I go and bring
medicine for Meera Devi?

614
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:34,840
Why didn't you tell me earlier
that I've to go to the doctor?

615
01:17:35,340 --> 01:17:37,621
- Oh, if only you'd listen!
- Oh, Aunt, if only you'd say.

616
01:17:37,790 --> 01:17:40,050
Look, dear,
get the medicine from the doctor...

617
01:17:40,390 --> 01:17:41,990
and give it to the gatekeeper.

618
01:17:42,220 --> 01:17:45,100
After that you go wherever
you wish, okay?

619
01:17:56,500 --> 01:17:58,220
- Mangu?
- Who is it?

620
01:18:00,090 --> 01:18:02,590
- Where's your father, Mangu?
- He went to the river to bathe.

621
01:18:03,550 --> 01:18:09,070
Look, aunt gave this
medicine for Meera Devi. Deliver it.

622
01:18:09,430 --> 01:18:11,710
Give me, sir. But, sir my hands.

623
01:18:12,310 --> 01:18:15,410
Sir, you kindly go and deliver.
She'll be in the old ruins.

624
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:24,269
Lord, bless me peace.

625
01:18:43,110 --> 01:18:47,179
- Lord, bless me peace.
- Devi.

626
01:18:56,900 --> 01:18:58,400
I brought medicine for you.

627
01:19:10,090 --> 01:19:12,106
The doctor prescribed
two pills in the morning...

628
01:19:12,130 --> 01:19:13,830
and two in
the evening with water.

629
01:19:18,380 --> 01:19:23,970
- Your eyes are red. Do you have a fever?
- No.

630
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:30,980
- It seems you've cried a lot.
- You can leave if you wish.

631
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:37,540
- And if I wish to sit?
- You can sit. But why?

632
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:42,080
If you wish to talk, I will talk.

633
01:19:44,010 --> 01:19:45,940
If you like silence
I will keep quiet.

634
01:19:53,730 --> 01:19:58,059
My eyes are closed
and your eyes are staring at me.

635
01:19:58,950 --> 01:20:00,450
It's to your advantage.

636
01:20:01,350 --> 01:20:04,260
A heart's desires and the churning
of the mind can be read in the eyes.

637
01:20:07,190 --> 01:20:10,030
- The things that my eyes want to tell you...
- I don't want to know.

638
01:20:10,270 --> 01:20:14,670
And what I want to read in your eyes,
you're hiding from me.

639
01:20:16,130 --> 01:20:20,080
Gaining control over every weakness
is my duty.

640
01:20:24,410 --> 01:20:25,710
One more thing.

641
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:33,360
By suppressing developing feelings,
won't they become stronger?

642
01:20:35,830 --> 01:20:37,130
That's your misconception.

643
01:20:39,950 --> 01:20:43,730
I quell them, crush them underfoot.

644
01:20:45,700 --> 01:20:47,656
It seems senior
mother gave you a lot of...

645
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:49,280
knowledge in a very few days.

646
01:20:51,370 --> 01:20:54,030
A woman is born with
forbearance and rules,

647
01:20:56,470 --> 01:20:58,950
the same way passion
makes a man weak.

648
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:06,370
Will you be my guru?
Will you initiate me?

649
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:10,520
- You find the world worthless?
- No.

650
01:21:12,580 --> 01:21:14,530
I want to gain your company.

651
01:21:16,010 --> 01:21:18,010
Wearing ascetic
clothes cannot help it.

652
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:23,830
This requires a very big sacrifice.

653
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:31,160
I'm ready.

654
01:21:34,990 --> 01:21:36,290
Then forget despair...

655
01:21:37,430 --> 01:21:38,730
and erase hope.

656
01:21:43,220 --> 01:21:47,290
- Then what will be left in life?
- Ultimate peace.

657
01:21:49,670 --> 01:21:51,270
Won't unfulfilled wishes cause distress?

658
01:21:55,620 --> 01:21:58,450
In such a condition we need
to practice more self denial.

659
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:01,760
This is the duty of ascetics.

660
01:22:03,350 --> 01:22:04,950
What should a worldly person do?

661
01:22:07,390 --> 01:22:08,790
Stay away from weakness.

662
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:13,990
Otherwise one falls,
pitfalls happen.

663
01:22:16,280 --> 01:22:18,040
Aren't some pitfalls welcome?

664
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,480
For each minor pitfall...

665
01:22:22,820 --> 01:22:24,790
we have to practice
intense austerity.

666
01:22:32,740 --> 01:22:36,599
- Once you used to write poems.
- Now I compose devotional songs.

667
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:40,140
I'm talking about your life
before renouncing the world.

668
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:46,920
- I used to write.
- Do you have those poems?

669
01:22:48,460 --> 01:22:50,970
- I do.
- Will you give them to me to read?

670
01:22:53,100 --> 01:22:56,070
Not now. You may go now.

671
01:23:46,330 --> 01:23:51,269
The boat is rocking...

672
01:23:51,690 --> 01:23:56,570
Cross safely,
and I'll concede your skill, boatman

673
01:24:11,740 --> 01:24:16,860
Desires have
surrounded my restless heart

674
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:26,410
Pitdalls lie ahead at every step

675
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:36,860
Save my honor,
oh protector of honor

676
01:24:36,910 --> 01:24:41,730
Cross safely,
and I'll concede your skilll, boatman

677
01:24:41,830 --> 01:24:46,870
The boat is rocking

678
01:24:46,930 --> 01:24:51,840
Cross safely and
I'll concede your skill, boatman

679
01:24:59,470 --> 01:25:04,540
Darkness has spread everywhere

680
01:25:09,570 --> 01:25:14,150
I have no support apart from you

681
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:24,560
Hold my hand, Krishna

682
01:25:24,690 --> 01:25:29,379
Cross safely,
and I'll concede your skill, boatman

683
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:34,389
The boat is trembling,
if you row it across...

684
01:25:34,430 --> 01:25:39,280
Cross safely,
and I'll concede your skill, boatman

685
01:25:46,450 --> 01:25:51,500
Devotees pleased you
with devotional songs

686
01:25:56,530 --> 01:26:01,240
I entice you with
my shedding of tears

687
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:11,390
Help raise the one who is
falling down, Kanhaiya

688
01:26:11,470 --> 01:26:15,940
Cross safely,
and I'll concede your skill, boatman

689
01:26:18,180 --> 01:26:20,550
Father, why is the Devi going away?

690
01:26:21,090 --> 01:26:25,520
Dear, they are saints.
They don't have a permanent home.

691
01:26:26,220 --> 01:26:28,820
Today she's here, tomorrow
I wonder where she'll be.

692
01:26:30,110 --> 01:26:34,130
We may have affection for her.
But she is an ascetic.

693
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:54,330
Viju, I am going.
I made tea for you.

694
01:26:55,050 --> 01:26:56,746
Where are you going so early, aunt?

695
01:26:56,770 --> 01:26:59,306
The whole village is going to bid
farewell to the religious woman.

696
01:26:59,330 --> 01:27:00,730
I, too, will go.

697
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:09,889
- Will you come?
- You know I'm an atheist.

698
01:27:11,410 --> 01:27:13,730
You're not so fortunate
as to see such saints.

699
01:28:04,630 --> 01:28:06,430
When will I get to see you again?

700
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:12,070
Take me along, Mother. Who will
look after you if I'm not there?

701
01:28:13,540 --> 01:28:18,830
Do you see
how painful affection is?

702
01:28:22,530 --> 01:28:24,519
If you have this much
affection for God...

703
01:28:27,030 --> 01:28:28,530
your life will be successful.

704
01:28:40,770 --> 01:28:42,170
Take these prayer beads.

705
01:28:43,900 --> 01:28:45,400
When your heart gets restless...

706
01:28:46,290 --> 01:28:48,090
then chant the mantra,
Lord bless me peace.

707
01:29:39,180 --> 01:29:40,880
You suddenly decided
to leave the village?

708
01:29:42,940 --> 01:29:44,040
Why?

709
01:29:46,370 --> 01:29:48,620
My peace is disturbed at every turn.

710
01:29:52,350 --> 01:29:53,450
Why?

711
01:29:55,340 --> 01:29:56,880
When I begin to desire something...

712
01:29:58,280 --> 01:29:59,920
then leaving it is my duty.

713
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:04,400
Will feelings change
by a change of place?

714
01:30:09,230 --> 01:30:13,259
When the heart becomes restless,
the mind gets confused.

715
01:30:15,140 --> 01:30:16,896
Then, to bring it under control,

716
01:30:16,920 --> 01:30:18,320
it's necessary to atone.

717
01:30:21,300 --> 01:30:23,230
So you gain control over
the mind by atoning.

718
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:25,679
Then what?

719
01:30:29,500 --> 01:30:34,630
After that, stay away
forever from the object, the place...

720
01:30:35,540 --> 01:30:40,600
and the thoughts
that breach mental peace.

721
01:30:41,300 --> 01:30:42,400
Forever?

722
01:30:44,380 --> 01:30:46,880
- Won't I ever see you again?
- Never.

723
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:53,250
If you want me to be at peace...

724
01:30:57,220 --> 01:30:59,220
then don't take a step beyond this tree.

725
01:31:01,960 --> 01:31:06,350
Consider this the final boundary.
The final boundary.

726
01:31:14,730 --> 01:31:18,309
The ascetic has left (the world)

727
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:27,690
No one visits the pyre

728
01:31:28,110 --> 01:31:30,059
The ascetic has left

729
01:31:43,480 --> 01:31:47,469
The traveller has departed on his way

730
01:31:55,180 --> 01:31:58,540
The site is piled with ashes

731
01:32:04,420 --> 01:32:08,530
No companion, or beloved,
no one to call one's own

732
01:32:16,620 --> 01:32:19,756
Only the angel of Death

733
01:32:19,780 --> 01:32:25,250
Meera's Lord, this false relationship...

734
01:32:31,670 --> 01:32:34,950
has broken like a weak thread

735
01:32:37,720 --> 01:32:41,970
The ascetic is leaving

736
01:32:59,050 --> 01:33:02,510
Viju, aren't you feeling well, son?

737
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:05,200
Why don't you go to Bombay?

738
01:33:08,330 --> 01:33:10,330
Aunt, didn't you say,
not to sell this house?

739
01:33:11,630 --> 01:33:13,330
You'll keep returning
here time and again.

740
01:33:15,300 --> 01:33:17,000
And now you're ousting me from home?

741
01:33:17,540 --> 01:33:19,900
No, dear, it's not that.

742
01:33:21,630 --> 01:33:25,770
You keep quiet.
It worries me.

743
01:33:32,860 --> 01:33:34,200
You're worried.

744
01:33:35,380 --> 01:33:38,960
You go to Bombay,
your restlessness will end.

745
01:33:42,450 --> 01:33:45,150
This restlessness won't end
by going anywhere, Aunt.

746
01:33:49,850 --> 01:33:52,160
The faithful are so fortunate, Aunt.

747
01:33:55,080 --> 01:34:00,920
Go to the temple, plead to
the idol and get what you want.

748
01:34:05,730 --> 01:34:08,000
But where should
an atheist go to plead?

749
01:34:12,010 --> 01:34:13,710
Who can I ask for peace, Aunt?

750
01:34:22,240 --> 01:34:25,090
You left the village, that's good.

751
01:34:27,340 --> 01:34:28,940
What are my orders now?

752
01:34:29,330 --> 01:34:31,540
Chant the mantra of the Lord,
let me find peace.

753
01:34:32,390 --> 01:34:34,190
And devote yourself
to the service of God.

754
01:34:48,410 --> 01:34:52,940
A wounded man understands
the condition of the wounded

755
01:34:57,450 --> 01:35:00,650
No one else would know

756
01:35:06,380 --> 01:35:10,960
I'll be relieved of my pain...

757
01:35:15,500 --> 01:35:22,390
only when my beloved treats me.
No one could know the pain

758
01:35:22,670 --> 01:35:27,010
I'm crazy in love.
No one knows my pain

759
01:35:27,780 --> 01:35:30,400
No one could know the pain

760
01:35:46,380 --> 01:35:48,140
Mother, I've brought fruit.

761
01:35:53,940 --> 01:35:57,040
Senior mother has said
not to fast today.

762
01:35:57,580 --> 01:35:59,840
Make sure to drink
a little milk or eat fruits.

763
01:36:03,710 --> 01:36:08,090
Senior mother knows well
that I want to practice self denial.

764
01:36:10,070 --> 01:36:15,259
- Bindu, go and tell her.
- Is this self denial or atonement?

765
01:36:16,220 --> 01:36:19,060
You eat after three days.
And fast for three days.

766
01:36:20,330 --> 01:36:23,300
- My mind finds peace.
- And the body remains hungry.

767
01:36:23,930 --> 01:36:26,070
- For what sin is senior mother punishing...?
- Bindu.

768
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:31,040
You love me very much, right?

769
01:36:33,330 --> 01:36:35,000
What worldly people call 'love'...

770
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:38,480
ascetics like us call desire.

771
01:36:41,250 --> 01:36:46,050
Desire is a bondage.
It's our obligation to break it.

772
01:36:48,350 --> 01:36:51,060
Renouncing the world doesn't
turn an ascetic's heart into stone.

773
01:37:41,160 --> 01:37:43,309
Mr. Vijay. Mr. Vijay.

774
01:37:46,110 --> 01:37:47,410
How are you?

775
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:52,400
Oh, you still have a fever.
And you're roaming outside?

776
01:37:55,050 --> 01:37:56,350
What to do?

777
01:38:00,160 --> 01:38:01,760
I can't feel at ease anywhere.

778
01:38:08,620 --> 01:38:10,290
I find peace on coming here.

779
01:38:18,760 --> 01:38:22,620
It's raining. You won't
be able to reach home.

780
01:38:36,900 --> 01:38:38,400
Lie down in the room.

781
01:39:06,590 --> 01:39:07,790
Come in.

782
01:39:34,420 --> 01:39:35,770
Come, relax.

783
01:40:36,020 --> 01:40:38,520
Senior mother, what's
wrong with Bhagvati?

784
01:40:39,030 --> 01:40:42,300
Day and night she practices very
strict self denial round the clock.

785
01:40:43,200 --> 01:40:48,250
- I'm afraid that...
- Don't worry. This gives her mental peace.

786
01:41:04,120 --> 01:41:07,070
Lord, bless me peace.

787
01:41:29,940 --> 01:41:32,460
- Lord, bless me peace.
- Mangu.

788
01:41:33,120 --> 01:41:36,410
- Lord, bless me peace.
- Hey, Mangu.

789
01:41:39,250 --> 01:41:40,960
- Did you also become an ascetic?
- Yes.

790
01:41:41,380 --> 01:41:43,280
Devi gave me these prayer beads.

791
01:41:43,510 --> 01:41:47,540
And she said, when the heart
gets restless then hold...

792
01:41:47,820 --> 01:41:51,090
these beads and chant the
mantra 'Lord, bless me peace'.

793
01:41:52,460 --> 01:41:54,160
Why is your heart
getting restless, Mangu?

794
01:41:54,440 --> 01:41:57,040
I am not at ease
since Devi left.

795
01:41:58,840 --> 01:42:00,640
Are you gaining peace
on chanting the mantra?

796
01:42:01,280 --> 01:42:05,660
Yes, sir. You also
seem lost and restless.

797
01:42:05,940 --> 01:42:07,339
Take these prayer beads.

798
01:42:12,010 --> 01:42:13,880
Restlessness is my peace, Mangu.

799
01:42:16,680 --> 01:42:22,230
If my disquiet goes away,
then what will be left in life?

800
01:43:05,220 --> 01:43:07,180
Arrange the articles
for the worship.

801
01:43:09,860 --> 01:43:14,980
And ask senior mother,
to kindly let me meet her.

802
01:43:17,400 --> 01:43:20,099
Mother, why do
you talk like this...

803
01:43:21,090 --> 01:43:23,360
as if you want to
bid farewell to us?

804
01:43:25,850 --> 01:43:30,670
Crazy girl, everybody has to bid
farewell one day or another.

805
01:43:37,070 --> 01:43:40,969
And if it's so,
then do something for me.

806
01:43:43,380 --> 01:43:44,680
Won't you, please?

807
01:43:48,920 --> 01:43:50,320
Look at that book.

808
01:43:59,220 --> 01:44:01,250
Take it to Kalinagar.

809
01:44:04,710 --> 01:44:07,120
There is a large tree
on the boundary of the village.

810
01:44:09,800 --> 01:44:14,530
You'll find someone
sitting there. Give it to him.

811
01:44:15,420 --> 01:44:16,620
His name?

812
01:44:19,070 --> 01:44:20,170
Name?

813
01:44:22,340 --> 01:44:23,940
Even I don't know his name.

814
01:44:31,240 --> 01:44:35,730
This is the last boundary.
Never step past this.

815
01:44:39,770 --> 01:44:47,770
Don't go, I plead at your feet

816
01:44:52,550 --> 01:45:00,550
Don't go, don't go, don't go,
yogi, I plead at your feet

817
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:30,830
The path of devotional love is unique

818
01:45:36,090 --> 01:45:39,320
Guide me that way on it

819
01:45:46,390 --> 01:45:51,310
I will assemble a pyre of sandalwood

820
01:45:56,610 --> 01:46:00,500
Burn it with your hands

821
01:46:00,710 --> 01:46:08,710
Don't go, don't go, don't go,
yogi, I plead at your feet

822
01:46:37,240 --> 01:46:41,800
I am burned into a pile of ashes

823
01:46:47,200 --> 01:46:51,920
Apply me on your body, yogi

824
01:46:57,150 --> 01:47:01,960
Meera's Lord is
Giridhar Nagar (Krishna)

825
01:47:07,160 --> 01:47:11,066
Unite the flame with flame

826
01:47:11,090 --> 01:47:19,090
Don't go, don't go, don't go,
yogi, I plead at your feet

827
01:47:36,570 --> 01:47:39,280
Om...

828
01:47:43,940 --> 01:47:46,940
Senior Mother, what's
wrong with Bhagwati?

829
01:47:57,470 --> 01:48:00,060
Lord, at your feet...

830
01:48:32,510 --> 01:48:35,180
Sir, this book is for you.

831
01:48:41,140 --> 01:48:42,340
For me?

832
01:49:05,770 --> 01:49:08,330
Devi ordered me to give it to you.

833
01:49:15,850 --> 01:49:17,550
What else did Devi order for me?

834
01:49:18,020 --> 01:49:20,700
May I go and see her? Where is she?

835
01:49:35,770 --> 01:49:37,560
Lord grant peace.

836
01:49:40,520 --> 01:49:44,210
- Now you can see only her memorial.
- What?

837
01:49:56,760 --> 01:50:00,800
The ascetic has left (the world)

838
01:50:05,310 --> 01:50:10,050
No one visits the pyre

839
01:50:10,330 --> 01:50:14,380
The ascetic has left

840
01:50:25,560 --> 01:50:29,310
The traveller has departed on his way

841
01:50:37,500 --> 01:50:41,290
The site is piled with ashes

842
01:50:46,570 --> 01:50:51,570
No companion,
no one to call one's own

843
01:50:58,470 --> 01:51:01,200
Only the angel of Death

844
01:51:01,550 --> 01:51:07,440
O Meera's Lord, this false relationship...

845
01:51:13,630 --> 01:51:16,840
broke like a weak thread

846
01:51:19,690 --> 01:51:24,980
The ascetic has left
