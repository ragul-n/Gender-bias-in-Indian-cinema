1
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,398
Impressive.

2
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,398
Quite.

3
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:26,919
Is she famous?

4
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,999
Name is Kim. Age 21 .

5
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,559
According to her CV,
she isn't that popuIar.

6
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,438
How Iong wiII she take to
be that anyway, Brother?

7
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:44,479
Besides that, the
rates are aIso okay. -Yes.

8
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:45,919
Next.

9
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:52,479
That's it.

10
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,119
Then what more? CaII Tinu.
Give him the dates.

11
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:56,479
TeII him to book.

12
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,438
She'II be perfectIy
fine for the KL shoot.

13
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,919
Yes, even we had thought so.

14
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:02,799
Start off with your work.
No more deIay.

15
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:04,719
I'm in my room.
TeII me if there's any need.

16
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:06,119
Okay, boss.

17
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,599
Oh, God. You're so happy about
going to your oId workpIace?

18
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:18,719
You bet.

19
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:20,878
Were you in KuaIa Lampur?

20
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:24,799
For 2 years before
joining this office.

21
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:27,878
I worked and expIored
the pIace, too.

22
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:29,559
Then why did you come back?

23
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:35,039
Lousy job, but an awesome pIace.
And the food there..

24
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,719
What's the matter, Creative
Director Mr. Ranojoy Chatterji?

25
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,518
Why are you so quiet?

26
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,479
Didn't you Iike Ms. Kim?

27
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,479
I've some urgent
things to teII you guys.

28
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,719
What?

29
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:03,799
ActuaIIy I'm myseIf very
confused how to start.

30
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,518
It's not onIy an
unexpected matter to me..

31
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,518
..but seriousIy
disturbing and aIarming as weII.

32
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:14,919
What is it?

33
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:24,078
Your conspiracy.
SeIIing an entire concept.

34
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:35,958
I didn't beIieve it when I
heard it. I Iaughed it off.

35
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:39,518
But Iater when..
- How did you come to know?

36
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:41,599
Who toId you?

37
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,198
I won't teII you that.
I came to know.

38
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,078
Wow. What to do when
you've aIready come to know?

39
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:52,559
Caught red-handed.
So now what wiII you do?

40
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:55,958
WiII you demand your own share?

41
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:02,559
Are you trying to
take me into your group?

42
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,958
Come on, Ron. Be friends,
man. Friends.

43
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,159
Remember? - And in business,
straight roads are onIy for fooIs.

44
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,679
Oh, God. Didn't you
understand that tiII now?

45
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,559
If such a major cIient
goes out of our hands..

46
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,559
..have you ever thought
where wiII the prestige and..

47
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,638
..reputation of this company go?

48
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,318
Strange.

49
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,559
We aII had worked hard
day and night..

50
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:29,999
..and together
formed the entire concept.

51
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,599
And without my knowIedge,
you soId that concept..

52
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:33,999
..to another agency
for a high price?

53
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:35,758
Won't we be affected by this?

54
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,239
I don't think so.

55
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,919
That means honesty has no vaIue?

56
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:44,599
For your information,
this is the common..

57
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,119
..practice nowadays, my Brother.

58
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:49,719
Listen carefuIIy to
what I'm teIIing you.

59
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,679
Just shake the matter off your mind.

60
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,039
Forget it and join the cIub, right?

61
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,838
We'II remain as we are.

62
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,878
I'II not Iet the goodwiII of
this agency get ruined at any cost.

63
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,119
That means the offer of puIIing
you into our team goes in vain.

64
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,758
Right?

65
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,318
Okay. So teII me what you suggest.

66
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,799
There is a way. Just one.

67
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,158
But wiII you take it?

68
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,038
Yes, you say. Let's hear it.

69
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:39,758
The concept presentation before
the cIient is after three days.

70
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:46,719
Our job wiII be to take a
drastic step and stop it..

71
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,038
..at any cost.

72
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,158
Oh, God. But you know what, Rano?

73
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,319
Whether we want to
stop it or not, that you..

74
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,398
What if we don't take
your suggestion?

75
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:08,719
Why don't you understand..

76
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:10,319
..that someday brother
Rothin wiII come to know about it.

77
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,479
It is bound to happen.

78
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:13,079
MiIi, make them understand. PIease.

79
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,439
Who wiII discIose the
matter to boss? You?

80
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:25,038
Just joking. Just joking, man.

81
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,278
It's not a joke, Brother Deep.

82
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,079
You're going to faII
into grave troubIe.

83
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:35,758
Imprisonment?

84
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,158
Then?

85
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,199
What wiII you do knowing about it,
Ani? You won't understand.

86
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,558
Shame. Shame. Shame. Shame.

87
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:53,599
Such a bad thing and you
didn't teII me anything?

88
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,239
TeII me, what wouId I have toId you?

89
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,038
Did I beIieve it myseIf initiaIIy?

90
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,038
CIose peopIe.

91
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:08,239
That's the probIem. Too cIose.

92
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,599
That's why accepting
it is difficuIt.

93
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:16,199
Brother Deep is the CEO, right?

94
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:24,079
Brother Deep.
The CEO because of whom..

95
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:29,359
..I got this job,
whom brother Rothin trusts bIindIy.

96
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:33,599
Now I feeI he is the main cuIprit.

97
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,079
And when sister MiIi
is in accounts..

98
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:40,758
..even she is invoIved.
With them, Shubho, Joy..

99
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,719
You know, Ani, as if I can't
recognize these four peopIe.

100
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,758
They seem to be different peopIe.

101
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:54,518
CoId, ruthIess, caIcuIating.

102
00:10:58,639 --> 00:10:59,719
Now what wiII happen?

103
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:02,839
Sister. I'm going, Sister.
- Go.

104
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:06,599
What?

105
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,319
There is some time,
though not much.

106
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:14,278
But the four of them
shouId agree to it.

107
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,719
And if that doesn't happen?

108
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,319
That'II be a major
setback for the agency.

109
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,518
That they don't seem to understand.

110
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,199
See, everything wiII be fine.

111
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:27,599
I hope so.

112
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:31,878
Give.

113
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:36,599
If they don't understand
after me trying so much, then I..

114
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,239
It's brother Deep.

115
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:44,199
HeIIo, teII me.

116
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:50,158
Now? The other two?

117
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:55,278
Right. I'm Ieaving within 5 minutes.

118
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,239
Maybe they've
understood their mistake.

119
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,359
They want to discuss it with me.

120
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:00,599
I heard that. Now?

121
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,398
Right now. At brother Deep's pIace.

122
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:03,839
Even Shubho and Joy are coming.

123
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,638
That means in Rajarhat?

124
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,758
So what?

125
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,918
Listen, you have your
dinner if I get Iate.

126
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,798
No. I'II wait.

127
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,918
As you wish.

128
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,439
The car keys are
on the coffee tabIe.

129
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,319
What happened? You're stiII upset?

130
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,959
CouIdn't it be done tomorrow?

131
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:35,758
These things shouIdn't
be Ieft for Iater, Ani.

132
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,878
A stitch in time.. - You don't have
to say proverbs. Now go.

133
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,878
Cheers.

134
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:55,839
OnIy if I can drive such
a Iong way after this.

135
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,439
You don't say.
Have you ever had more than one peg?

136
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,319
But if you get drunk,
not to worry.

137
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,719
AII of us wiII carry you
and take you to your wife.

138
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,239
That's the onIy way out.

139
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:09,959
What I was teIIing you..

140
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:14,239
After work, we aII sat
in that conference room.

141
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,959
There was an unanimous
decision within 5 minutes.

142
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:22,599
We decided to caII
Mr. Ranojoy Chatterji once more.

143
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,999
Okay. Then Iet's think
once more with a caIm mind..

144
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,398
Where are you going?
- I'm coming.

145
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:32,878
Nothing can be done
without the agency's accountant.

146
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:38,278
And our Mr. Rano beIieves in
the intuitive power of women.

147
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:40,278
Right, isn't it?

148
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:44,278
AbsoIuteIy. And as a CEO,
even your inputs..

149
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,918
I'II do my best.

150
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,758
But won't you hear what
our unanimous decision is?

151
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:59,319
Why? Joy toId..
- Ron. Listen, Ron.

152
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,678
Try to understand the
matter properIy.

153
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:05,959
Whatever had to happen
has happened.

154
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,719
The deaI is done, Ron.
Now it's too Iate. - AbsoIuteIy.

155
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,319
Look, Ron. We promise
this is the Iast time.

156
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,359
Last time? How can you that?

157
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,239
What's the guarantee
you won't do this again?

158
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,719
That means you've caIIed me
here to teII me that same thing?

159
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:35,719
SeriousIy. You aII have
stooped so Iow. - Disgusting.

160
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:39,719
Same..
- No. - Sorry.

161
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,079
Look, Ron. I've toId you earIier as
weII. It's going on quite often now..

162
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,278
..and in every big agency.

163
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,079
So are aII the agencies
cIosing down?

164
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,398
They aII are overcoming
troubIes and opening newIy.

165
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:51,798
What nonsense are you taIking?

166
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:55,758
How much have you got?
Each of you?

167
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,918
How much have you got?

168
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,038
How much have you got
for seIIing our concept?

169
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:12,878
Answer me.

170
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:19,878
I'II caII you back Iater.

171
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,878
Why are you quiet?
Give me an answer.

172
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,278
Whatever we may have got,
what's your..

173
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:33,199
Whatever we've got,
it won't be repeated again.

174
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:38,038
PIease, Ron. Let it be this time.

175
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,798
ScoundreI. ScoundreI. ScoundreI.

176
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,119
Where are you going?
- Shubho.

177
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,119
Where are you going? We're
standing on you. - Shubho.

178
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:48,878
Our promotion depends on you.

179
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:55,319
Shubho, no.

180
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:05,239
Ron. Ron. Ron. Water. Quick.

181
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,798
What are you standing and
staring at? Pick him up. - Yes.

182
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:13,839
SIowIy. SIowIy.
- Let's take him carefuIIy. - SIowIy.

183
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,558
SIowIy.
- CarefuIIy. Very carefuIIy.

184
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,278
Keep him here.

185
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:27,239
Ron. Ron. Give me water.

186
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,359
Ron. Ron.

187
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:46,918
What?

188
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:30,919
Everybody, switch
off your mobiIe phones.

189
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:33,558
Okay. Okay.

190
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,038
Did you hear it? Switch
off both mobiIe and IandIine.

191
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,479
Brother Deep.

192
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,999
Joy, take the keys and get
Ron's car near the gate.

193
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:05,598
No. Don't touch it
with your bare hand.

194
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:07,318
Use a handkerchief.

195
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:14,999
MiIi. I had bought a pair
of gIoves from Kufri, right?

196
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,558
Yes.
- Give those.

197
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,318
The phone you're trying
to reach is switched off.

198
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,118
PIease try again Iater.

199
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:41,959
Set the room.
And connect the IandIine.

200
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:44,719
Ani may caII. HandIe her.

201
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,439
Come on. Quick. Quick.

202
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:51,038
You go that side.

203
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:16,199
CarefuIIy. Get down. Get down.

204
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,199
Push.

205
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,719
HeIIo.

206
00:20:57,119 --> 00:20:58,318
Yes, this is Anindita speaking.

207
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:02,719
Yes. HeIIo. HeIIo.. .Ani? TeII me.

208
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,679
Is he there?

209
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:12,199
Rano? No. He Ieft
aImost 1 0 minutes back.

210
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,159
Nobody is avaiIabIe
on their mobiIes.

211
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,719
And for a Iong time,
even your IandIine..

212
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:22,518
Is it?

213
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:25,798
Let me see for some more time.

214
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:30,399
Okay. See. He'II come soon. See.

215
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,038
He must not take too
Iong so Iate in the night.

216
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:40,239
Okay. - Yes. Listen, heIIo.
Let me know when he returns.

217
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:44,038
I wiII. Bye.

218
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:55,278
Wow. You used to act in
schooI pIays? This way?

219
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,758
Imagine what Ani wiII
think if you fumbIe Iike this.

220
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:00,999
Be normaI. CasuaI.

221
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,038
I can't. More than this,
isn't possibIe for me.

222
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:11,798
Listen, MiIi. Ron must
have toId Ani about us.

223
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:15,358
AIso why he had come here today.

224
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,399
So we've to assume that she knows.

225
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:25,439
Then.. then the poIice..
- No. She won't say it.

226
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:29,798
She has just come here from DeIhi.

227
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,118
We're the onIy known
peopIe to her here.

228
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,038
Against us onIy..

229
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,959
And even if she does speak,
so what?

230
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,439
MiIi, onIy a spoken
word is not enough.

231
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,798
The poIice want proof
which they won't find..

232
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,558
..because we've done
whatever we've done with caution.

233
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:49,798
Now the poIice may carry
out an investigation..

234
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,038
..may interrogate if they want.

235
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,838
But if you and we
remain okay through it..

236
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:58,479
..we'II go scot-free.

237
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:03,358
Did you understand?
- Yes.

238
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:09,118
Stop. Stop. Stop.

239
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,518
There's a person inside the car, sir.
- Yes.

240
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,278
HeIIo.

241
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:39,399
Who is speaking?

242
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:41,598
Who is speaking?

243
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,479
I'm sub-inspector Pitush Shamanta.

244
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,999
I'm Anindita Chatterji.

245
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:48,999
Do you know anyone
named Ranojoy Chatterji?

246
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,999
He's my husband.

247
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,439
What did you say?

248
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:54,358
He's my husband.

249
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,879
You've to come at once.
He has met with an accident.

250
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,239
Where?

251
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:11,999
Excuse me.
- Speak.

252
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:14,318
I'm Mrs. Chatterji.
Anindita Chatterji.

253
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:15,639
Come.

254
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:17,159
Anindita Chatterji.

255
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,558
Ranojoy chatterji..
- Yes, he's my husband.

256
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:23,239
We're very sorry,
Mrs. Chatterji. Your husband..

257
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,038
Wait. Put him down.

258
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:21,639
Why did you inform us
after such a Iong time?

259
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,518
Are we outsiders for you?

260
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,118
What wouId you have done
by coming here, Mother?

261
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,598
We couId have been beside you.

262
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,639
Even sister wanted to come.

263
00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:35,999
I know. She had caIIed up.

264
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,999
You've toId even her not to come.

265
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,278
It's so expensive coming
here from abroad for a few days.

266
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,999
What's the use?

267
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:48,399
You can't put yourseIf
in a sheII Iike this, Ani.

268
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:55,078
I'm fine, Mother.
Don't worry so much for me.

269
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,999
If Rano's parents were aIive,
they wouIdn't have been..

270
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:01,558
..abIe to bear this shock.

271
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,239
Ani.

272
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,038
WiII you have tea?
- Make it Iater.

273
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,439
Come. Sit with us for some time.

274
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,358
Are you thinking of
doing something?

275
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:07,598
You know, he didn't
beIieve in aII this.

276
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,159
There has just been a condoIence
ceremony from the office.

277
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,239
A young man of 26 years of age.

278
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:23,078
Bright, enterprising,
fuII of promise.

279
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:27,159
And most importantIy, honest.

280
00:27:29,319 --> 00:27:32,358
Destiny truIy is so ruthIess.

281
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,118
The autopsy report says
there was aIcohoI in his stomach.

282
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:41,439
AIcohoI?
- But you said not at aII..

283
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:50,278
He did not drink. OnIy occasionaIIy.
Sometimes.

284
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:52,199
Then?

285
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:55,798
That day after work he had
gone to a coIIeague's pIace.

286
00:27:57,519 --> 00:27:58,679
Maybe there itseIf..

287
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,278
Did you ask that coIIeague?

288
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:09,719
Yes. He had drunk. He had aIso got
a bit out of controI.

289
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:15,318
Though..
- What?

290
00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:23,278
The autopsy says the
aIcohoI content is minimaI.

291
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,278
ActuaIIy you know what?

292
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:29,159
Those who don't drink at
aII besides on occasions..

293
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:33,479
..maybe their constitution..
- What nonsense are you saying?

294
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,278
Seeing him in that condition,
couIdn't his coIIeague..

295
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:36,719
..drop him home that night?

296
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:43,479
He had offered I heard.
But he refused.

297
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:49,558
Then.. in Rajarhat..

298
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,838
Has anybody done any
investigation regarding this?

299
00:28:57,519 --> 00:28:58,598
Listen, Ani.

300
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,199
If you stiII have any
doubt in your mind..

301
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:03,838
..then I'II take an initiative and..

302
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:15,358
It's of no use,
Father. The case is cIosed.

303
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:18,399
Take.

304
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,318
Why did you make tea?

305
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,399
You both are so choosy about
tea that I didn't teII her.

306
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,798
Does MaIati stay at night?

307
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,798
What?

308
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:33,719
That means you're aIone aII night?

309
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,959
I'II get used to it, Mother.

310
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:39,879
Can I say something?

311
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,479
Yes. TeII me.

312
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,278
You come back to DeIhi.

313
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:46,358
Yes. Right.

314
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:50,399
You've aII known peopIe
and friends over there.

315
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:53,278
See, you'II feeI
better within a few days.

316
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,479
That's not possibIe, Mother.

317
00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:58,318
Why not possibIe? TeII me.
Who do you have here?

318
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:03,439
There are many formaIities.
Let me take care of aII those.

319
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,999
And anyway, next month
I'm joining his company.

320
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:09,879
Rano's company?

321
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:12,399
Means that advertising agency?

322
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,919
On the condoIence day,
Rano's boss Rothin Goswami..

323
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:20,598
..caIIed me aside
and gave me this offer.

324
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:23,598
WiII you come to us in vacations?

325
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:26,598
I'II come.

326
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:29,838
ReaIIy, dear?

327
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,439
Sure, Mother.

328
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:43,479
Come. Where are the
rest of the peopIe?

329
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,518
In Swabhumi.
At PC Chandra's photo shoot.

330
00:30:45,799 --> 00:30:47,919
Right. Right. How come you are here?

331
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,278
Don't even ask. On reaching the spot,
I saw that..

332
00:30:50,359 --> 00:30:51,598
..I had forgotten to
take the approved artwork.

333
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,318
It was in a pen-drive.
I can't find where it is.

334
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:59,038
He said it is here itseIf.
He's an idiot. An idiot.

335
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,719
See whom I've brought today.

336
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,758
Anindita. She has joined today.

337
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,719
How are you?

338
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:09,719
Fine. - She wiII work
under you from today.

339
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:13,919
Good. Good. Excuse me.

340
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:16,199
Yes, teII me.

341
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:17,358
Work with him.

At around 1 2:30.

399
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:23,158

FortunateIy,

409
00:36:57,159 --> 00:37:01,238

00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,759
I mean the gIass broke
and the watch stopped.

AII of us are stunned.

Yes. The fact of the matter is
that there's possibiIity of a..

427
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:57,759
..hit-and-run on a road,
but here it can be a murder.

428
00:37:58,519 --> 00:38:01,158
Murder?
- PossibIy. - Murder?

429
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,359
Are you aII staying in the city now?

Sir.

Where are we going?

434
00:38:15,239 --> 00:38:16,598
First to the poIice station,

435
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:21,158
You aII start.
I'II reach there after some time.

436
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:25,759
Dashu, what about
the pick-up guard?

437
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,558
MaIini's condition is such
that I was feeIing bad..

438
00:38:33,639 --> 00:38:36,078
..to Ieave her aIone.

Why did you come?
You couId have stayed.

What do you mean by mishap?

448
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:16,759
The poIice are
suspecting it to be a murder.

449
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:21,158
Murder? Why? For what?

450
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:28,118
Beats me. Now Iet's see
what the hospitaI says.

451
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:33,839
Brother Deep.
- Yes?

452
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,999
Do we canceI the
shoot day after tomorrow?

453
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,879
Not at aII. Ani, it's a new cIient.

454
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,638
It wiII be a catastrophe if we
are not abIe give an artwork..

455
00:39:43,719 --> 00:39:44,799
..the next day.

456
00:39:45,639 --> 00:39:47,718
But..
- No buts.

457
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:51,718
No matter what our mentaI
condition is, the shoot is on.

458
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,999
Is it okay?

459
00:40:01,639 --> 00:40:02,919
Hasn't she yet come?

460
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,038
No. Not yet.

461
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:06,799
TeII me, what do I do? I can't
even get through her mobiIe.

462

Okay. Be patient. It's just 1 0:30.

No, no. But I know her.

1 0:00 is actuaIIy 9:00 for her..

465
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,759
You try her phone once and see.

00:40:22,679 --> 00:40:24,759
What happened? You're outside?

467
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,078
What do we do?
OindriIa hasn't come yet.

468
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,678
What do you mean by
hasn't come yet? CaII her up.

469
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:35,359
I had toId you not to
take her before itseIf.

470
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,959
Brother Deep, she's one of the best.
You know that, right?

471
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,999
And has she ever been
Iate for our work? Has she?

472
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:43,359
She hasn't before.
She's doing it now.

473
00:40:43,719 --> 00:40:46,118
Before she didn't
get spoiIt, now she is.

474
00:40:46,199 --> 00:40:49,999
Oh, God. OindriIa in disposed.

475
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,718
She has viraI fever since morning.

476
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,439
Oh, God. She
shouId've Iet us know once.

477
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,319
Height of unprofessionaIism.

478

Is MiIi inside?
- Yes.

479
00:40:58,119 --> 00:40:59,999
Let's see if she can

00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:02,118
One of the best, right?

481

Can you remember any other name?

482
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,959

Don't bother.

Why can't you do it?
You have to do it.

- Listen to me once. Listen.

506
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,078
Here she is. Here. Here she is.

507
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:34,959
OindriIa?
- No, no. She can't come today.

508
00:42:35,159 --> 00:42:37,919
So she'II sit on your throne today.
- Okay.

509
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,919
No. - Sit. Sit. Sit. - No.
- Look, for heaven's sake.

510
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,198
PIease trust me. Okay?
It's nothing.

511
00:42:45,239 --> 00:42:47,558
See, you'II feeI a IittIe
nervous before the first shot.

512
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,198
There wiII be
butterfIies in your stomach.

513
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,439
Then you'II see that aII
of that wiII be over. Yes.

514
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:53,839
And besides that, what's there
to worry about? We aII are there.

515
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:54,959
It's a famiIiar atmosphere.
What's there to be scared of?

516
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:56,839
No tension. Sister MiIi.
- Yes?

517
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,879
I'm saying that wiII we
get costumes for madam?

518
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,959
I guess we wiII.

519
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:02,518
Great. Amazing.

520
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:06,359
What are you waiting for?
Get started.

521
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:48,198
Wow.. Come. - You didn't get hurt,
right? - No. - Come.

522
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,479
Brother Shanak.
- Yes? - Where wiII we zoom?

523
00:43:51,559 --> 00:43:55,038
A IittIe back. A IittIe back.
- Here? - Don't puII.

524
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:57,919
See, it's aII okay?
- I'm feeIing very hot.

525
00:43:58,559 --> 00:44:01,238
AIright. Okay. Thank you.
Where is the zone?

526
00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:04,959
LittIe back. LittIe back.
- Is this the zone?

527
00:44:08,519 --> 00:44:09,558
Open your eyes.
- Ready?

528
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:53,359
Pack up.

529
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,479
What a day!

530
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:56,959
Why? You didn't Iike it?

531
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:00,238
What aII troubIes you put me into.
My Iimbs had gone coId.

532
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:05,959
I had toId you once it
gets started..

533
00:45:06,039 --> 00:45:07,558
..aII the nervousness vanishes.

534
00:45:08,119 --> 00:45:09,479
And you know what the
most important thing is?

535
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:11,598
You know the entire team.

536
00:45:12,519 --> 00:45:14,359
Whatever you say, but no more.

537
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:17,158
But why not anymore?

538
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:20,718
Throughout the day, Iike a
doII with a painted face..

539
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:23,319
But do you know the
rate of that doII?

540
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,038
What?

541
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,158
Five times more than
madam OindriIa.

542
00:45:29,239 --> 00:45:30,279
Means?

543
00:45:30,719 --> 00:45:31,999
ExactIy what you're thinking.

544
00:45:32,519 --> 00:45:34,999
The cIient was taking an
about-turn hearing she..

545
00:45:35,079 --> 00:45:37,999
..won't come, but as
soon as he saw the doII..

546
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:39,198
..his eyes popped open in amazement.

547
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,078
Means compIeteIy bowIed over.

548
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:47,158
And approved of whatever rate
I caIIed out getting that chance.

549
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:49,158
You'II get the money
tomorrow itseIf.

550
00:45:49,559 --> 00:45:51,399
No matter how much you
tempt me, enough is enough.

551
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,078
DoubtfuI.

552
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,598
Means?

553
00:45:56,079 --> 00:45:57,558
Do you know what they
said after the shoot?

554
00:45:57,599 --> 00:45:58,678
What?

555
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:01,999
They said that from now on,
in aII our campaigns..

556
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:03,279
..we want onIy Anindita Chatterji.

557
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:05,118
Pardon me, dear.

558
00:46:09,039 --> 00:46:10,598
WiII you go home or somewhere eIse?

559
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,238
Mad or what?

560
00:46:15,159 --> 00:46:16,238
What's your pIan
after office tomorrow?

561
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,198
I'm thinking of going
to see OindriIa once.

562
00:46:22,159 --> 00:46:24,279
She didn't sound
okay over the phone.

563
00:46:26,039 --> 00:46:29,238
What wiII you teII her? That you
took her one day's saIary?

564
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:32,718
You're seriousIy impossibIe.

565
00:46:33,639 --> 00:46:35,319
You see the negative
side of everything first.

566
00:46:36,199 --> 00:46:38,518
The poor girI wiII sureIy
understand if she's toId niceIy.

567
00:46:39,639 --> 00:46:43,238
Try and see. But what after that?

568
00:46:45,079 --> 00:46:46,118
Home.

569
00:46:47,079 --> 00:46:49,118
No. Not your home. My home.

570
00:46:50,679 --> 00:46:51,718
Yours?

571
00:46:52,239 --> 00:46:53,518
Tomorrow, I'II get
your CD in my hand.

572
00:46:53,719 --> 00:46:55,439
We both wiII sit and
watch it together.

573
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:59,198
PIease. It's ridicuIous
to see one's own photos.

574
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:00,518
Then you see me.

575
00:47:02,559 --> 00:47:06,078
No. ReaIIy. Your first assignment.
So successfuI.

576
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,078
I think we shouId ceIebrate.

577
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:10,359
But onIy the two of us. Nobody eIse.

578
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:13,198
My house. 1 0:00 pm sharp. Agreed?

579
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,198
And candIeIight dinner?

580
00:47:16,639 --> 00:47:18,078
UnfortunateIy, you know, nowadays..

581
00:47:18,159 --> 00:47:19,558
..there isn't much Ioad-shedding.

582
00:47:22,719 --> 00:47:26,158
No. You won't Iet go of
your commission, I see.

583
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:27,718
Does anyone Ieave this commission?

584
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:33,359
That means it is
what you had suspected?

585
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:39,118
CoId-bIooded murder.
PIain and simpIe.

586
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:40,558
But why?

587
00:47:42,239 --> 00:47:46,118
The victim's girIfriend
couIdn't provide us with any Ieads.

588
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:50,718
And anyways, you said you aII
were in the office that day.

589
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:52,198
TiII Iate night.

590
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:55,198
ActuaIIy yesterday there
was an important ad shoot.

591
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:58,118
So tiII Iate night, there was
an important meeting. - Yes.

592
00:47:58,199 --> 00:47:59,279
Preparation.

593
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:02,198
OnIy Mr. Jayanta had
gone home earIy.

594
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:08,279
MaIini, as in his girIfriend,
wasn't fine.

595
00:48:09,559 --> 00:48:12,759
But I can say one
thing very confidentIy.

596
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:16,158
That I never heard of
any scuffIe he has..

597
00:48:16,239 --> 00:48:18,879
..had with anyone in this office.

598
00:48:19,159 --> 00:48:20,759
In fact, he was very popuIar.

599
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,799
But if he had issues outside
work with anyone..

600
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:25,839
No. We didn't get
any hint of that.

601
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:30,759
Come in. - Sir, two reporters
have come from Star Ananda ChanneI.

602
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:32,638
Okay, make them sit in
the reception. I'm coming.

603
00:48:32,719 --> 00:48:33,879
Okay.

604
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:38,158
That means now the case..

605
00:48:38,639 --> 00:48:40,759
No, no. It's difficuIt
to say anything right now.

606
00:48:42,199 --> 00:48:45,319
Besides, you can see how
the media is pressurizing us.

607
00:48:46,719 --> 00:48:50,919
Anyways, we'II continue
with our investigation.

608
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:54,718
AIong with that,
if we appoint someone eIse..

609
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:57,198
..as in unofficiaIIy,
then wiII you..

610
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,558
I mean do you aII mind?

611
00:48:59,639 --> 00:49:01,198
If that reaIIy heIps
to soIve the case..

612
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:02,319
..then what's the probIem?

613
00:49:02,599 --> 00:49:04,279
You do that, Inspector Bhoumik.

614
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:06,879
We'II cooperate
with you in every way.

615
00:49:21,039 --> 00:49:22,118
Hi. - Hi.

616
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:23,118
Dinner's here.
- And desert. Come in.

617
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:26,638
Dinner's here.
- And desert. Come in.

618
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,078
Where is the dinner tabIe?

619
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,038
That side.
- Okay.

620
00:49:40,039 --> 00:49:41,158
Nobody is there, right?

621
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:44,879
No. It's the maid's off day today.

622
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:45,999
Has to be.

623
00:49:51,719 --> 00:49:54,759
Oh, God. It seems to be
a big dinner.

624
00:49:55,639 --> 00:49:57,238
We're ceIebrating. Remember?

625
00:49:57,639 --> 00:49:58,919
Of course.

626
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:04,198
Whatever I serve, you've to
eat it with a smiIe. Understood?

627
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:07,678
Why? Is there a
possibiIity of getting sad?

628
00:50:08,719 --> 00:50:09,799
I don't think so.

629
00:50:10,679 --> 00:50:13,078
See, Kashmiri potato gravy.

630
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:21,678
Cumin rice and Iast
but not the Ieast..

631
00:50:22,679 --> 00:50:24,959
..spicy mutton a' Ia Anindita.

632
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:30,678
I've to taste this.

633
00:50:37,039 --> 00:50:38,279
My photos are in your Iaptop,
right?

634
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:42,158
Yes. I've kept it on the
tabIe on the right side.

635
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:07,919
You Ieft office at 6:30.
Then went to madam's pIace.

636
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,799
When did you get the
time to cook so many items?

637
00:51:13,719 --> 00:51:16,078
If there's a wiII, there's a way.

638
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:26,879
You said that it's ridicuIous
to watch one's own photographs.

639
00:51:29,039 --> 00:51:33,799
Won't I test someone
who has such a high rate?

640
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:49,919
You shouId've Iistened
to madam Shuchi's warning.

641
00:51:51,079 --> 00:51:52,118
What?

642
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,078
That you're a fIirt.

643
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:04,319
My commission.

644
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:13,959
Which perfume is this?

645
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:16,839
Do you Iike it?

646
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:56,439
You?

647
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:01,839
You? Why did you?

648
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:03,999
You..

649
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:11,118
The mutton is my own recipe.

650
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:15,038
There isn't much time Ieft.

651
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:20,158
You..

652
00:53:26,159 --> 00:53:27,399
What did you do to him?

653
00:53:30,119 --> 00:53:31,879
What did you do to my husband?

654
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:42,999
My wish whatever I did.

655
00:55:10,159 --> 00:55:17,959
You? You are..

656
00:57:20,679 --> 00:57:21,839
Good morning. TeII me.

657
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:23,399
Shubho is dead.

658
00:57:24,639 --> 00:57:25,678
What?

659
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:27,518
Her maid had gone on a hoIiday.

660
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:30,359
She returned this morning
and saw this has happened.

661
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:31,479
She was the one who informed me.

662
00:57:31,559 --> 00:57:33,158
But.. but how?

663
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:34,518
God knows.

664
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:37,238
I've informed the poIice.
I'm aIso on the way.

665
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:38,399
ShouId I pick you up?

666
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:41,238
No. No. We're reaching there.

667
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:42,359
Okay.

668
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:53,799
What?

669
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:58,678
Shubho. Dead.

670
00:58:01,559 --> 00:58:02,678
What are you saying?

671
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:06,879
Our office has been cursed.
Let's go. Let's go home.

672
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:14,439
Ani.
- What? - Ani.

673
00:58:15,239 --> 00:58:16,279
Ani? What?

674
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:18,759
She.. she is doing aII this.

675
00:58:21,639 --> 00:58:24,238
Did you understand it?
Ani is doing aII this.

676
00:58:25,039 --> 00:58:26,638
What nonsense are you saying?

677
00:58:27,639 --> 00:58:29,359
Deep, we have kiIIed her Rano.

678
00:58:31,199 --> 00:58:34,718
Ani is now kiIIing us one by one.

679
00:58:35,239 --> 00:58:37,718
First Joy, now..

680
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:40,638
She is doing this?

681
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:43,198
What do I know about it?

682
00:58:44,679 --> 00:58:48,198
She can do it herseIf or
make someone eIse do it.

683
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:52,198
We've snatched the
cIosest person from her, Deep.

684
00:58:52,679 --> 00:58:53,839
Won't she take revenge?

685
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,839
Taking Iaw into her own hands?

686
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:01,759
She is doing it herseIf
because Iaw couIdn't do anything.

687
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:04,319
No. Absurd.

688
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:09,038
It's impossibIe for a
woman Iike Ani to do this.

689
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:11,839
And between her and Shubho,
there was a..

690
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:13,759
A woman can do
anything in desperation.

691
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:16,279
And she isn't a dumb girI.

692
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:20,759
She is quite cIever
and inteIIigent.

693
00:59:31,239 --> 00:59:36,439
Deep. Deep, now it's our turn.

694
00:59:40,119 --> 00:59:43,038
Prabhat Ranjan Bandopadhyay.
Ex cop.

695
00:59:44,039 --> 00:59:46,198
Inspector
Shoumeshwar Bhoumik's ex boss.

696
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:49,879
It's been three
years since I've retired.

697
00:59:50,719 --> 00:59:52,839
FrankIy, I had had enough.

698
00:59:54,199 --> 00:59:58,198
But Iast night when
Shoumeshwar aImost..

699
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:03,279
..forcibIy invoIved me in this case,
unofficiaIIy of course..

700
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:06,118
..then I couIdn't refuse.

701
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:12,558
I'm 63 and a widower.

702
01:00:14,159 --> 01:00:17,399
My onIy daughter is
married and settIed in America.

703
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:21,198
Time doesn't seem to pass.

704
01:00:23,079 --> 01:00:26,319
Besides, I took this case to check..

705
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:28,799
..whether my
facuIties have rusted or not.

706
01:00:30,159 --> 01:00:34,319
I feeI there is a variety
in it, there's a chaIIenge.

707
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:40,319
Within a gap of three days,
two empIoyees of this agency..

708
01:00:41,159 --> 01:00:42,999
..have died.

709
01:00:44,519 --> 01:00:48,839
One was hit by a vehicIe,
the other by poisoning.

710
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:51,439
Serious business.

711
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:54,078
That's why I've come to you today.

712
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:57,598
And I feeI it is important
because the two who've..

713
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:02,279
..died were quite cIose to you aII.

714
01:01:03,519 --> 01:01:10,198
In fact, you aIways work
together as a team. Right?

715
01:01:12,599 --> 01:01:13,839
Right?

716
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:18,158
Now it's your turn.

717
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:19,518
But Iet me warn you.

718
01:01:21,239 --> 01:01:23,999
No matter what
you've toId Shoumeshwar..

719
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:27,479
..pIease teII me the truth.

720
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:35,959
FirstIy, the Managing Director
of this agency, Mr. Rothin..

721
01:01:36,039 --> 01:01:38,479
HeIIo. I'm Rothin Goswami.

722
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:40,238
TeII me, sir.

723
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:43,638
What do I say?
This agency is jinxed.

724
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:47,839
We had Iost another person
of our team three months back.

725
01:01:48,599 --> 01:01:49,839
ReaIIy?

726
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:54,158
Creative Director
Ranojoy Chatterji. Her husband.

727
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:56,078
What had happened?

728
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:57,479
Car..
- Car accident.

729
01:01:58,199 --> 01:02:00,638
Within a few says after that,
we Iost another major cIient.

730
01:02:01,039 --> 01:02:04,558
Even that was a disaster.

731
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:08,558
But now to some extent..

732
01:02:14,119 --> 01:02:21,359
Anindita Chatterji. The news
is unfortunate, Mrs. Chatterji.

733
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:26,279
Anyway, does Mr. Bhoumik
know about this accident?

734
01:02:27,519 --> 01:02:28,598
I don't think so.

735
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:34,558
Okay and the one who
died day before yesterday..

736
01:02:36,119 --> 01:02:39,238
..Shubhodeep De
was a member of your..

737
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:41,638
..creative team, right?

738
01:02:42,199 --> 01:02:43,279
Yes.

739
01:02:43,519 --> 01:02:44,959
Any probIem?

740
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:47,118
Not that we know of.

741
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:54,919
We suspect this is
either a suicide or a murder.

742
01:02:56,599 --> 01:02:58,638
In fact, the
possibiIity of murder is more..

743
01:02:58,719 --> 01:03:01,678
..because we didn't
find any suicide note.

744
01:03:02,679 --> 01:03:05,999
That day nothing was
cooked at Shubhodeep's house..

745
01:03:06,039 --> 01:03:08,359
..but the trace of meat
was found in his stomach.

746
01:03:09,079 --> 01:03:11,238
And that meat was poisoned.

747
01:03:15,519 --> 01:03:19,439
That means the murderer was a
cIose friend of the victim's.

748
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:26,198
Shubhodeep had brought the
murderer home that night..

749
01:03:27,039 --> 01:03:29,359
..and had eaten the meat
brought by him or her.

750
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:33,158
According to the doctor's report,
Shubhodeep's death..

751
01:03:33,239 --> 01:03:37,078
..happened say
between 1 0:00 and 1 0:30 pm.

752
01:03:37,559 --> 01:03:42,279
Can you aII teII me that day,
I mean day before yesterday..

753
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:47,158
..where you were at that time.

754
01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:50,678
Mr. Rothin.

755
01:03:51,079 --> 01:03:53,238
Day before yesterday,
there was a dinner engagement.

756
01:03:53,559 --> 01:03:54,718
Where?
- At the cIub.

757
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:57,078
Which cIub?
- DaIhousie.

758
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:58,479
Are you a member?
- Yes.

759
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:03,238
I returned home at
about 1 1 :00 or 1 1 :1 5 pm.

760
01:04:03,679 --> 01:04:06,439
AII aIibi. Very good.

761
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,198
KamoIika Mitra.

762
01:04:12,039 --> 01:04:15,759
My wife. I'm..
- Deep Mitra. - That's right.

763
01:04:16,679 --> 01:04:17,718
TeII me.

764
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:19,638
We both were at home.

765
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:21,399
Anybody eIse?

766
01:04:22,159 --> 01:04:24,038
Yes. The maid.

767
01:04:28,639 --> 01:04:34,198
At home. AIone. I've a maid.
She goes back home at night.

768
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:39,598
Are you aII in town?

769
01:04:40,199 --> 01:04:42,319
We have to stay here.
It's inspector Bhoumik's order.

770
01:04:42,639 --> 01:04:45,439
But they were supposed to go
to KL next week. But that..

771
01:04:45,519 --> 01:04:48,158
Out of the question.
Defer the trip in that case.

772
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:50,638
There's no way. Otherwise canceI it.

773
01:04:52,239 --> 01:04:54,718
Can you come with me once?

774
01:05:00,079 --> 01:05:01,158
Thanks.

775
01:05:05,159 --> 01:05:07,118
I'm thirsty after
taIking so much. You know?

776
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:10,038
Is there a coffee
bar anywhere cIose by?

777
01:05:10,199 --> 01:05:13,598
Why cIose by? It's here itseIf. Come.
- Okay.

778
01:05:22,679 --> 01:05:24,118
Take it.
- Thank you.

779
01:05:26,119 --> 01:05:28,359
Come.
- Thanks.

780
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:33,319
Wow.

781
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:40,518
Your husband's matter..

782
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:45,479
When did it happen?

783
01:05:46,199 --> 01:05:47,359
1 6th March.

784
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:50,158
Was it pubIished in the newspaper?

785
01:05:51,239 --> 01:05:52,359
I don't know.

786
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:55,678
Even if it was pubIished, I
wasn't in a frame of mind to see..

787
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:01,839
Do you do modeIing as weII?

788
01:06:05,119 --> 01:06:07,359
I saw few of your photos
at Shubhodeep's pIace.

789
01:06:08,239 --> 01:06:10,799
My first assignment.

790
01:06:12,199 --> 01:06:15,919
Your photos at his pIace.
What's the matter?

791
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:17,919
He was supposed to coIIect
those day before yesterday..

792
01:06:18,159 --> 01:06:19,359
..and show us yesterday.

793
01:06:20,679 --> 01:06:23,558
Is this the ruIe of your agency?
- Yes.

794
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:30,198
You used to assist him, too, right?

795
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:35,279
How was your reIation
with him? Good?

796
01:06:35,519 --> 01:06:37,238
We were friends.

797
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:41,238
And his reIation with others?

798
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:46,518
I never heard it was bad.
But now I feeI..

799
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:52,678
Anyways. Let's get
back to the first topic.

800
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:55,638
It's our nature.

801
01:06:56,199 --> 01:06:58,718
Do you feeI there's
any connection between..

802
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:05,839
..your husband's
accident and these two murders?

803
01:07:08,519 --> 01:07:09,598
I don't know.

804
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:18,759
Okay. I have your
address and other detaiIs.

805
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:22,359
I'II get in touch
if there's any need.

806
01:07:23,679 --> 01:07:24,759
Sure.

807
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:27,319
This..
- Give me. - Thanks.

808
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:40,919
What did she taIk about
with Mr. Prabhat for so Iong?

809
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:44,598
How wiII I know that?

810
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:49,359
She didn't teII him about us,
right?

811
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:51,839
Then she'II be the
first one to get trapped.

812
01:07:52,599 --> 01:07:53,718
What happened?

813
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:54,919
He had coffee.

814
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,198
Okay. And?

815
01:07:57,199 --> 01:07:59,999
Few questions about Rano.

816
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:05,558
Ani.

817
01:08:06,719 --> 01:08:07,799
What?

818
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:09,839
Listen, do you have
Tinu's mobiIe number?

819
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:11,238
Tinu's.. Yes, I have it for sure.

820
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:12,359
WiII you try once?

821
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:13,638
Can't contact from
my and MiIi's phone.

822
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:15,399
I'II contact him. Don't bother.

823
01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:16,679
And Iisten.
- What?

824
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:19,318
TaIk to him in BengaIi.
Or eIse he gets very annoyed.

825
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:20,919
Ex-CaIcuttan.
You know that, right?

826
01:08:21,319 --> 01:08:22,398
Won't I know it?

827
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:29,839
Shoum, I need a copy
of the autopsy report.

828
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:33,839
Yes. Today itseIf.
Urgent. Note it down.

829
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:41,398
Ranojoy Chatterji. Car accident.
1 6th March, 2009.

830
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:43,879
When wiII you give it to me? Where?

831
01:08:45,279 --> 01:08:49,238
Your cIub means InternationaI CIub?
Okay. See you then. Bye.

832
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:53,679
Yes. I'II Iet you know as soon as

01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:56,318

Thanks a ton, Tinu.
Thanks. Take care. Bye, bye. Bye.

01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:34,679

01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,078
Thank you, Brother.

01:09:36,158 --> 01:09:37,237
It's okay. I'm Ieaving.

838
01:09:58,359 --> 01:10:00,679
Handsome man.

01:10:03,239 --> 01:10:08,719
Good evening.
- Good evening. - Good evening.

01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:09,999

01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:20,839
Here it is.

845
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:32,759
Absurd.

846
01:10:34,359 --> 01:10:37,278
According to the aIcohoI
content they're saying..

847
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:39,639
..how can it resuIt
into drunken driving?

848
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:41,919
No. Don't teII me anything.
I wasn't there in that case.

849
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:48,559
You mean the case couId have
been soIved if you were there?

850
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:56,879
Nobody in the agency
mentioned about the accident?

851
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:00,318
Maybe because the case is cIosed.

852
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:06,398
Agency's Creative Director's
accidentaI death on 1 6th March.

853
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:10,759
ExactIy after that, the
waIk-out of a major cIient.

854
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:16,759
Some days after that, two
creative team members get kiIIed.

855
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:21,599
Coincidence? Or..

856
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:25,679
You mean the three
are inter-connected?

857
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:27,358
I have a feeIing.

858
01:11:28,039 --> 01:11:32,478
Nowadays there is corruption,
under-hand deaIings.

859
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:37,519
No. The mind won't
work unIess we pIay.

860
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:42,919
Are you game for it?

861
01:11:50,079 --> 01:11:51,358
What are you thinking?

862
01:11:54,079 --> 01:11:57,559
I'm thinking the KuaIa
Lampur trip won't be a bad pIan.

863
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:01,158
Yes, it wiII be good for you.

864
01:12:02,439 --> 01:12:04,919
Your oId workpIace,
everything famiIiar.

865
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:07,719
You'II get to meet
your oId girIfriends, too.

866
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:11,559
I'm not exactIy
thinking about that.

867
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:16,759
Then?

868
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:21,959
If your intuition is correct,
if correct at aII..

869
01:12:23,399 --> 01:12:27,398
..then it'II be easier to get
the work done abroad than here.

870
01:12:29,119 --> 01:12:31,759
Work? What work?

871
01:12:33,119 --> 01:12:35,599
The four of us couId
remove the husband.

872
01:12:36,479 --> 01:12:38,078
Both of us won't be
abIe to remove the wife?

873
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:39,919
Deep.

874
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:44,719
Why? You had said
that now it's our turn.

875
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:51,639
Listen, MiIi. If Ani
is the reaI cuIprit..

876
01:12:53,199 --> 01:12:56,919
..then we'II kiII her
before she kiIIs us.

877
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:59,799
But I've canceIIed the KL trip.

878
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:05,719
I feeI instead of canceIIing it,
we shouId Iet the three of them go.

879
01:13:06,159 --> 01:13:07,438
Means?

880
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:10,198
Not to worry. Even I'II go.

881
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:11,999
Even you?

882
01:13:12,079 --> 01:13:14,599
Not together.
By the previous fIight.

883
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:18,078
The investigation is on and
the media is eagerIy waiting.

884
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,559
We can assume that
the murderer is aIert.

885
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:24,719
That means he won't do
anything fooIish aII of a sudden.

886
01:13:25,079 --> 01:13:27,919
But do you think he or she
may turn wiId once abroad?

887
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:31,599
Whatever you say.

888
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:32,999
Motive?

889
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:36,438
You didn't find anything.
- No.

890
01:13:37,199 --> 01:13:38,238
I knew that.

891
01:13:40,079 --> 01:13:41,879
How can you be so sure
about the three of them?

892
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:44,599
I'm not sure compIeteIy.

893
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:48,919
Then? A person who doesn't
have an aIibi is a murderer?

894
01:13:49,239 --> 01:13:50,559
Not at aII.

895
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:55,599
Instead, you can caII it a hunch.

896
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:58,799
Oh, God. This thing
about you is very dangerous.

897
01:13:59,239 --> 01:14:00,919
I have heard that it
has ever misfired.

898
01:14:01,239 --> 01:14:05,078
ExactIy. And don't
forget that Shobhodeep..

899
01:14:05,479 --> 01:14:07,198
..knew his attacker.

900
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:10,639
Whatever you say, Brother Prabhat.

901
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:12,999
I'm feeIing a IittIe
uneasy about the matter.

902
01:14:14,039 --> 01:14:16,238
You're sending the three
of them in this situation?

903
01:14:17,039 --> 01:14:24,278
I'm not. You are. OfficiaIIy.

904
01:14:25,159 --> 01:14:29,919
Okay. Suppose I do. And you
aIso chase them tiII there.

905
01:14:30,319 --> 01:14:31,839
Correct.

906
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:36,639
Suppose nothing happens on
that trip.

907
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:41,118
In that case, your hunch
proves to be compIeteIy wrong.

908
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:44,999
Then? Then the entire trip wiII be..

909
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:53,318
No. I made a mistake
by teIIing you.

910
01:14:54,279 --> 01:14:55,599
You get so excited
getting certain cases.

911
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:57,158
You tend to forget your age.

912
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:00,358
You don't have to
worry about my age.

913
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:02,919
TeII me, wiII you be abIe
to organize the matter..

914
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,799
..through your infIuence or not?

915
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:06,719
I'II see to my own traveI probIems.

916
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:09,278
And yes. Give me a Ietter
so that I can take a step..

917
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:11,879
..there if need arises.

918
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:15,839
Okay. I'm saying that..
- Do as I teII you.

919
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:23,318
Okay, fine.

920
01:15:24,319 --> 01:15:26,799
I'm teIIing them that
the trip is on.

921
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:28,278
And I'II know their
whereabouts, too.

922
01:15:28,359 --> 01:15:31,919
Good. That's Iike a good boy.

923
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:47,919
[ Skipped item nr. 922 ]

924
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,038
Yes, sir.

925
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:54,759
HeIIo. Your fIight was Iate.

926
01:16:08,159 --> 01:16:10,879
I wouId Iike to go to the
Pingtang Warrison HoteI, pIease.

927
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:11,999
Yes, sir.

928
01:17:49,119 --> 01:17:52,879
Hey, buddy boy. How are you?

929
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:55,719
AbsoIuteIy fine. You
haven't changed at aII.

930
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:58,398
Where have you changed?
- ReaIIy? - Just the same.

931
01:17:59,079 --> 01:18:00,318
Okay, meet my wife MiIi.

932
01:18:01,119 --> 01:18:04,438
HeIIo. - HeIIo. - Tinu Mehra at
your service, ma'am. - Thank you.

933
01:18:04,479 --> 01:18:05,759
What can I do for you?
- Nothing as of now.

934
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:07,238
Brother Tinu.
- Yes?

935
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:09,478
Ani, with whom you had
taIked over the phone.

936
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:14,879
Hi. - My God. You're so
much prettier than I thought.

937
01:18:15,359 --> 01:18:17,919
Oh, thank you.
- Let's go. - Let's go. Let's go.

938
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:22,799
Come. Was the fIight aIright?

939
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:24,278
Oh, yes. ComfortabIe.
- Good.

940
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:26,038
Did you get the draft?

941
01:18:26,199 --> 01:18:27,759
Yes. I got it yesterday.

942
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:30,118
Is the amount adequate?
- AbsoIuteIy.

943
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:31,999
So what are we doing now?

944
01:18:32,439 --> 01:18:35,038
Straight to the hoteI.
The shoot is at 1 2:00.

945
01:18:35,079 --> 01:18:36,879
By the way,
are we getting the team?

946
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:40,398
UnfortunateIy not.
- What? - What?

947
01:18:40,479 --> 01:18:41,519
What?

948
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:43,759
Yes. You peopIe aren't to bIame.

949
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:46,078
Yesterday, you toId me
that the shoot is today..

950
01:18:46,159 --> 01:18:47,919
..and today you're
saying that there's no shoot.

951
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:49,759
What can I do?

952
01:18:50,159 --> 01:18:53,198
Sorry.
That was an internaI probIem.

953
01:18:53,279 --> 01:18:54,438
We couIdn't do anything about it.

954
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:56,278
You don't have to worry.

955
01:18:56,399 --> 01:18:59,438
I've caIIed in for another one
but they haven't confirmed yet.

956
01:19:00,199 --> 01:19:01,599
But the Iocation of the
shoot is beautifuI, right?

957
01:19:02,399 --> 01:19:04,999
Haven't you gone to Patrojia?
- No.

958
01:19:05,239 --> 01:19:09,078
Oh, it's so beautifuI.
AbsoIuteIy amazing.

959
01:19:09,199 --> 01:19:12,198
You're going to Iove it.
- I hope so. - Yes.

960
01:19:20,439 --> 01:19:21,839
What? Can you recognize?

961
01:19:22,279 --> 01:19:23,358
Of course.

962
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:25,398
How many years Iater have you come?

963
01:19:27,079 --> 01:19:29,639
It's.. To be precise.. eight.

964
01:19:30,399 --> 01:19:33,038
My God. How time fIies, right?

965
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:36,118
How about having some snacks?

966
01:19:37,399 --> 01:19:40,559
What? Have you digested aII
the food you ate on the fIight?

967
01:19:41,119 --> 01:19:42,358
Long back.

968
01:19:43,479 --> 01:19:44,519
Not to worry at aII.

969
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:47,959
You're going to fIip if
you see the breakfast tabIe..

970
01:19:48,359 --> 01:19:49,398
..in our Radius HoteI.

971
01:19:49,479 --> 01:19:50,599
ReaIIy?

972
01:19:50,680 --> 01:19:52,599
Yes. Don't worry.

973
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:33,599
Thank you. Bye.

974
01:20:35,359 --> 01:20:37,038
Shahana is confirmed.
- Thank you.

975
01:20:37,119 --> 01:20:40,679
Now I can show you her photograph.
See this.

976
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:44,919
Isn't she good?
- Yes. Good. - Amazing.

977
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,879
Confirmed? - Yes, sir?

978
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:49,078
I have two rooms
booked in the name of Admix.

979
01:20:49,399 --> 01:20:50,919
They're ready, sir.
- Thank you.

980
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,959
Isn't she amazing?

981
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,559
Approved? - Yes. Of course.
- ObviousIy. - Good.

982
01:21:00,640 --> 01:21:03,999
This is mine.
- Sure. - Okay. 1 1 9. Bye.

983
01:21:04,039 --> 01:21:05,478
Bye. - We'II meet over breakfast.
- Yes.

984
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:07,599
Ours is.. - Ours is there.
- Yes. - Right side.

985
01:21:28,079 --> 01:21:29,398
You'II go first or I wiII?

986
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:32,999
Good day.
- Good day.

987
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:43,639
HeIIo. HeIIo. HeIIo.

988
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:04,478
HeIIo. HeIIo. HeIIo.

989
01:22:21,199 --> 01:22:25,519
HeIIo. HeIIo. HeI..

990
01:22:35,079 --> 01:22:36,478
Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

991
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:40,759
This is Patrojia. It's caIIed
the InteIIigent Garden City.

992
01:22:41,039 --> 01:22:42,959
Very photogenic.
- Okay. - Isn't it?

993
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:45,599
Ani, see this. We are going
to shoot at this pIace today.

994
01:22:45,680 --> 01:22:47,959
Let's go. Let's go. I'm very hungry.
- Oh, Iet's go.

995
01:22:48,039 --> 01:22:49,238
Breakfast wiII get over. Let's go.
- Yes.

996
01:22:58,640 --> 01:22:59,719
Come.

997
01:23:23,720 --> 01:23:25,358
Brother Tinu.
- What?

998
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:27,318
How far is Patrojia from here?

999
01:23:27,479 --> 01:23:28,519
20 minutes.

1000
01:23:29,239 --> 01:23:30,318
We'II start at 1 1 :00.

1001
01:23:31,159 --> 01:23:33,438
After picking up Shahana,
you'II be there by 1 2:30.

1002
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:34,559
Good.

1003
01:23:35,199 --> 01:23:36,759
Excuse me, sir. WouId you
Iike to have some coffee?

1004
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:40,559
Yes? Coffee? Coffee?
- No. Coffee? - For sure. - For me.

1005
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:42,799
Three coffees.
- Sure, sir. - Thank you.

1006
01:23:44,159 --> 01:23:46,799
And if you finish the
work on time today..

1007
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:49,839
..you aII can go out
and enjoy the nightIife.

1008
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:51,839
You can do shopping, too.

1009
01:23:52,640 --> 01:23:53,879
Great. Not a bad idea.

1010
01:23:54,239 --> 01:23:56,158
But before that, we've
to convert our doIIars.

1011
01:23:56,239 --> 01:23:58,679
Not a probIem. I know
the best pIace in town.

1012
01:23:58,760 --> 01:24:00,559
Okay.
- You'II get a doIIar exchange.

1013
01:24:01,039 --> 01:24:03,919
Oh, great. Then you
can be our guide tonight.

1014
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:08,559
No, dear. I'm sorry. I have to go.

1015
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:09,719
What?

1016
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:11,038
I've a meeting.

1017
01:24:11,239 --> 01:24:12,318
Then?

1018
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:13,919
Then what?

1019
01:24:14,600 --> 01:24:15,839
You're not going to miss me.

1020
01:24:16,319 --> 01:24:18,919
You've the best guide in town.
Deep.

1021
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:22,839
He knows the best pops in town,
incIuding the shady ones.

1022
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:25,999
Oh, you.
- What say?

1023
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:28,959
Did you get your internationaI
driving Iicense?

1024
01:24:29,199 --> 01:24:31,238
Sure. How can I forget that?

1025
01:24:31,319 --> 01:24:33,118
Great. Good.

1026
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,078
What is in this?

1027
01:24:48,199 --> 01:24:49,719
Must have come from Tinu's office.

1028
01:25:17,640 --> 01:25:20,078
Listen, your charger..

1029
01:25:24,920 --> 01:25:25,959
What happened?

1030
01:25:32,279 --> 01:25:33,318
You are right.

1031
01:25:34,279 --> 01:25:38,719
Ani. Ani is doing
aII this. Nobody eIse.

1032
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:43,318
Have you seen her guts?
She is instigating us? Us?

1033
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:48,038
Let me see.

1034
01:25:49,199 --> 01:25:52,198
Again caIIed from that number.
That same number.

1035
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:53,719
Had caIIed before as weII.

1036
01:25:54,199 --> 01:25:55,278
Before?
- Yes.

1037
01:25:55,960 --> 01:25:58,278
Had caIIed me before.
Now on your phone.

1038
01:26:00,680 --> 01:26:03,038
No. No more.

1039
01:26:04,079 --> 01:26:05,158
We can't spare her anymore.

1040
01:26:06,239 --> 01:26:08,118
Whatever we've to do,
we've to do by tonight.

1041
01:26:09,039 --> 01:26:11,719
Deep. Deep, pIease.

1042
01:26:12,720 --> 01:26:13,999
Don't even utter these things.

1043
01:26:15,319 --> 01:26:17,719
We can't escape if
anything happens to her here.

1044
01:26:19,720 --> 01:26:22,318
PIease, Deep. Try to understand.

1045
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:26,799
Not here. Not here.

1046
01:26:27,199 --> 01:26:30,438
Day after tomorrow
we're returning to KoIkata.

1047
01:26:31,960 --> 01:26:35,879
Ani is going to London
to her sister.

1048
01:26:37,319 --> 01:26:40,719
Our and her tickets are separate.

1049
01:26:41,960 --> 01:26:45,398
So..
- What wiII you do?

1050
01:27:32,159 --> 01:27:35,519
Have a Iook at this.
- Wow. That's IoveIy.

1051
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:39,038
Satisfied?
- Yes. - Yes. - Very much.

1052
01:27:39,119 --> 01:27:44,799
AIright, boys. Let's wrap.
- Yes. - Thank you. - Bye.

1053
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:53,799
Bye, sweetie.
- Bye, honey. Thank you.

1054
01:27:54,399 --> 01:27:57,799
Deep, what happened?
Are you aIright?

1055
01:27:58,800 --> 01:27:59,879
SIightIy down.

1056
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:01,278
You don't have to worry.

1057
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:06,959
Get a good sIeep tonight.
Tomorrow, you'II be fresh.

1058
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:09,478
Jet Iag. I'II be aIright.

1059
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:13,278
Oh, God. I've to go.
But you don't have to worry.

1060
01:28:13,439 --> 01:28:15,839
AII payments regarding the
photo shoot have been made.

1061
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:18,999
Okay. - IncIuding the hoteI
biII tiII the day after tomorrow.

1062
01:28:19,079 --> 01:28:20,478
TiII 3:00.
- Thank you so much. - AIright?

1063
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:22,999
I've given instructions
to the office.

1064
01:28:23,079 --> 01:28:25,839
Tomorrow you'II get the
CD of today's photo shoot.

1065
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:26,959
That's great.

1066
01:28:27,039 --> 01:28:28,078
You..
- Thank you.

1067
01:28:28,439 --> 01:28:31,278
Don't miss the
performance at KL Towers. Okay?

1068
01:28:31,359 --> 01:28:32,398
What is there at KL Towers?

1069
01:28:33,439 --> 01:28:37,118
It's a cuIturaI dance program.
Very coIorfuI.

1070
01:28:37,199 --> 01:28:38,278
You must see it.

1071
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:41,238
And it's a pIeasure
working with Admix.

1072
01:28:41,319 --> 01:28:42,839
EspeciaIIy you, Deep.

1073
01:28:43,439 --> 01:28:44,519
I'II Ieave now.

1074
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:45,839
Come, I'II see you off.

1075
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:47,839
No. No. No. No. You stay here.

1076
01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:50,519
And you Iook after your husband.
- Sure.

1077
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:52,038
Ani wiII see me off, right?

1078
01:28:52,479 --> 01:28:54,318
WouId you, my dear?
- Sure. Come.

1079
01:28:55,399 --> 01:28:58,438
You and I under this umbreIIa..
this way..

1080
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:07,599
Deep. Keep the car.
It's an antique.

1081
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:10,078
Come. Let's go, my dear.

1082
01:29:30,279 --> 01:29:31,559
Don't think about
aII that anymore.

1083
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:34,959
PIease.

1084
01:29:40,439 --> 01:29:41,519
Give.

1085
01:30:10,920 --> 01:30:11,999
Listen.

1086
01:30:13,079 --> 01:30:15,799
I'm okay. I'm aIright.

1087
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:21,999
Let's go. Let's see
KL Towers tonight.

1088
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:18,519
Are we going straight
to the hoteI?

1089
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:21,198
No. To an oId bar I used to go to.

1090
01:31:22,079 --> 01:31:24,599
Today we'II have authentic
MaIaysian food for dinner.

1091
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:30,879
Daasi Lemak, Sateh,
and IastIy, Teh Tarek.

1092
01:31:31,199 --> 01:31:32,999
It's ambrosiaI.

1093
01:31:33,079 --> 01:31:34,118
I hope so.

1094
01:31:34,199 --> 01:31:35,278
Eat and then teII me.

1095
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:37,919
Where's the pIace?

1096
01:31:39,159 --> 01:31:43,078
Not very far. A
IittIe on the outskirts.

1097
01:32:14,199 --> 01:32:15,639
How far is it?

1098
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,639
Just a IittIe more distance.

1099
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:29,639
Get down.

1100
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:31,879
Get down.

1101
01:32:34,600 --> 01:32:35,679
Deep.

1102
01:32:40,079 --> 01:32:41,278
No.
- I'm teIIing you to get down.

1103
01:32:42,079 --> 01:32:43,118
What did you think?

1104
01:32:43,199 --> 01:32:44,278
What did you think?
- What are you doing?

1105
01:32:44,359 --> 01:32:45,919
I..
- Deep, Ieave her. - Shut up.

1106
01:32:46,760 --> 01:32:49,198
First you kiIIed Joy. Then Shubho.

1107
01:32:49,279 --> 01:32:50,358
Deep, pIease Ieave her.

1108
01:32:50,920 --> 01:32:53,999
Who next? - Deep.
- TeII me who is next. - Deep.

1109
01:32:54,079 --> 01:32:57,839
TeII me who. We, right? We?

1110
01:32:57,880 --> 01:33:01,278
Listen. You.. Now you..

1111
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:42,679
You can't escape, Mr. Deep.

1112
01:33:48,680 --> 01:33:49,879
Let's go. Run.

1113
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:57,999
Come.

1114
01:34:30,039 --> 01:34:31,999
Come on. Come on.
Go faster. Faster.

1115
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:55,078
Deep.

1116
01:35:11,880 --> 01:35:13,759
CaII the ambuIance.
And the poIice. Quick.

1117
01:35:13,960 --> 01:35:15,238
You.. wait here.

1118
01:35:16,079 --> 01:35:18,158
HeIIo. 999?

1119
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,799
As far as I think,
we've to spend the night..

1120
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:02,519
..at the hospitaI
and the poIice station.

1121
01:36:06,920 --> 01:36:09,559
I don't need this toy gun anymore.

1122
01:36:14,039 --> 01:36:15,118
What are you thinking?

1123
01:36:18,119 --> 01:36:21,999
Don't be scared. I won't get
you invoIved in this anymore.

1124
01:36:23,159 --> 01:36:25,919
I think I can handIe it myseIf.

1125
01:36:30,319 --> 01:36:34,839
Okay. And you truIy had no
fauIt in this accident..

1126
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:36,358
..Mrs. Chatterji.

1127
01:36:39,079 --> 01:36:43,839
If everything gets sorted
out by tomorrow afternoon..

1128
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:46,599
..after that I'II sit with you.

1129
01:36:48,439 --> 01:36:50,118
I'II Iisten to your entire story.

1130
01:36:51,279 --> 01:36:54,599
And see if that story
matches with my hunch..

1131
01:36:55,119 --> 01:36:59,118
What? HeIIo. Where.. where are you?

1132
01:36:59,199 --> 01:37:06,118
In the office or at home? Listen.
Listen carefuIIy.

1133
01:37:11,039 --> 01:37:14,158
Okay. Shoumeshwar
has done a good job.

1134
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:16,599
Both the bodies wiII be
boarding the fIight tomorrow.

1135
01:37:18,239 --> 01:37:19,278
Taxi.

1136
01:37:20,520 --> 01:37:23,919
Interesting.

1137
01:37:26,079 --> 01:37:30,879
Straight to London after
striking off the Iast two..

1138
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:32,919
..in your hit Iist?

1139
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:36,639
To your sister's?

1140
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:40,478
It's not the way you think.

1141
01:37:46,920 --> 01:37:52,999
I had aImost thought
not of kiIIing these two.

1142
01:37:58,520 --> 01:38:00,078
And I perhaps wouIdn't have
been abIe to do so as weII.

1143
01:38:00,520 --> 01:38:03,639
I had thought about
that to an extent.

1144
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:13,278
My prank didn't affect you
as much as it affected them.

1145
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:17,959
That means you perhaps understood..

1146
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:21,358
..that one of us has come here.

1147
01:38:29,199 --> 01:38:31,959
Perhaps, coming here wasn't
that easy for Mr. Shoumeshwar.

1148
01:38:32,079 --> 01:38:35,238
Very inteIIigent, Mrs. Chatterji.

1149
01:38:37,079 --> 01:38:39,118
And what if none of us had come?

1150
01:38:43,159 --> 01:38:44,238
Not even then?

1151
01:38:45,039 --> 01:38:46,438
It's too Iate.

1152
01:38:48,520 --> 01:38:53,198
No doubt that you're going tomorrow,
but not to London.

1153
01:38:56,600 --> 01:38:57,639
To KoIkata.

1154
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:04,519
And I'm canceIIing
this ticket of yours.

1155
01:39:08,720 --> 01:39:13,118
I know. I shouId've
understood before itseIf.

1156
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:25,238
Jayanto, Shubhodeep.

1157
01:39:34,760 --> 01:39:42,038
So much of importance.
OnIy if Rano..

1158
01:39:45,439 --> 01:39:46,679
You go to your room.

1159
01:39:58,640 --> 01:40:02,038
My duty wiII get over once
I reach KoIkata tomorrow..

1160
01:40:02,119 --> 01:40:06,719
..hand you over to the poIice
and expIain everything to them.

1161
01:40:09,319 --> 01:40:10,639
I won't do anything
other than this.

1162
01:40:13,600 --> 01:40:18,238
Oh, yes. Your passport.

1163
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:24,599
Don't worry. I won't eIope.

1164
01:40:25,680 --> 01:40:26,719
PIease.

1165
01:40:51,079 --> 01:40:52,118
Come.

1166
01:40:58,520 --> 01:41:01,999
Counter 'K'. Come.

1167
01:41:06,079 --> 01:41:08,478
I don't support someone
taking the Iaw in his..

1168
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:11,078
..or her hands, Mrs. Chatterji.

1169
01:41:12,880 --> 01:41:20,158
But Iater I thought that
if I was in your pIace..

1170
01:41:21,479 --> 01:41:27,879
..and if the Iaw had faiIed,
then maybe.. maybe..

1171
01:41:29,079 --> 01:41:31,639
..I wouId've chosen the way you did.

1172
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:40,839
So may I go now?

1173
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:47,118
Your fIight to London is
about two hours Iater.

1174
01:41:48,119 --> 01:41:50,519
And this.. this bag with
'Chatterji' written on it..

1175
01:41:50,600 --> 01:41:52,519
..is perhaps yours.

1176
01:41:54,840 --> 01:41:56,519
What? Isn't it?

1177
01:41:57,119 --> 01:42:00,799
But after reaching KoIkata, you..

1178
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:03,519
Even KoIkata knows
that yesterday's mishap..

1179
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:05,278
..is an accident.

1180
01:42:06,520 --> 01:42:10,519
And if anyone asks about you,
I'II say that you wanted to..

1181
01:42:10,600 --> 01:42:13,559
..come with me, but
I aImost forced you..

1182
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:14,759
..to go to your sister's in London.

1183
01:42:15,159 --> 01:42:20,879
And, yes. Your passport and ticket.

1184
01:42:21,800 --> 01:42:25,559
And I don't think the
previous two cases..

1185
01:42:25,640 --> 01:42:26,719
..wiII be proceeded.

1186
01:42:28,159 --> 01:42:29,959
You can caII it my hunch.

1187
01:42:31,560 --> 01:42:36,158
And, yes. I've deIeted
the page off your hit Iist.

1188
01:42:39,159 --> 01:42:43,639
I'II Ieave. It's time for my fIight.
There are many formaIities.

1189
01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:46,959
Mr. Prabhat.

1190
01:42:52,920 --> 01:42:56,679
You've caIIed me again?
I may change my mind.
