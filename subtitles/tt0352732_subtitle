00:00:20,086 --> 00:00:23,385
Long ago,long long ago, as long. . .

2
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:27,550
. . .since the evolution of
the universe to be exact.

3
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:33,392
There was a gold smith
who was the chieftain of the universe.

4
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:40,233
Then what happened?
-Without informing any one's knowledge

5
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:45,076
..he laid a golden egg
in the distant nest of the sky

6
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:28,787

Woke up?Take dad's medicine,dear.

9
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:19,336
Why do you want to
take it with much effort?

10
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,731
You should have called me!

11
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:44,454
Today it is little
on the higher side.

12
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:46,361
lt is every day
that is on the higher side.

13
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:50,464
Only if you crush
and squeeze and drink the physician..

14
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:51,537
..that your cough will subside.

15
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:55,200
You would not agree for
consulting a good doctor.

16
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:58,534
l want only the concoction.
-Your damn concoction!

17
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:01,046
Take the spittoon from him
and keep it down.

18
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:03,545
He holds it as if he would
n't get it when he goes up!

19
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:13,058
Why do you talk
that way,brother?

20
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:17,391
What will he think?
-He has started coughing since morning.

21
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,055
l could not concentrate
on my work.

22
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:22,063
Why not show him
to a good English doctor?

23
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,567
Won't he understand
Malayalam?

24
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,395
l should have given this
to that Hajiyar last week!

25
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:28,741
How can l?
l could not work peacefully!

26
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:33,071
His wife wanted
me to do it myself.

27
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:36,244
lf l do not give it on the said
date. l will lose their confidence.

28
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:41,743
Any thing beneficial for you in it?
-l don't think so!

29
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:46,420
They asked to make 4 bangles
of 5 sovereigns for festival.

30
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:50,420
That looks beneficial for me.
We have to survive.

31
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,494
Have you ever seen
the third wife of Hajiyar?

32
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,433
A gold smith have seen many women.

33
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:59,431
He has never allowed
her to be seen by others.

34
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:01,933
No body has seen her
nor been shown to others.

35
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:06,944
But,l have seen her,ls there a
place where goldsmith can't enter?

36
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:08,613
A woman should have
gold on her.

37
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:11,113
For gold, she needs a goldsmith
That is my greatness smith.

38
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:15,182
You keep telling your story.
Here he coughs to death.

God, What a cough!
He coughs in different ways every day.

42
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,334
The senior gold smith
has the afflictions of Saturn.

43
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:13,171
He has to cough
for that.

44
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:18,015
l have told Baskaran to make
2 earings for Snehalata!

45
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:21,518
Has he brought that?
-When did you give that?

46
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:23,188
That was 2 moths ago!

47
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:26,014
lf the senior coughs like this
that would be further delayed

48
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:27,522
lf you see his son, ask him!

49
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,197
lf you want to melt it
keep it on my chest.

50
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,027
lt is very hot there.
lt will get molten.

51
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:40,865
lf a goldsmith lives next door
lt is bad time for me astrologers.

52
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:43,034
Where is our daughter?
-She has gone to the temple.

53
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:15,904
l thought you would have gone
after getting bored

54
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:20,908
l am not bored. People have
waited for their life time for that.

55
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:27,576
l was waiting for you, behind
the temple.You look beautiful.

56
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:31,080
Today is my birthday
and you have forgotten that.

57
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,586
Aad gave you the gold
to make earrings for me to wear today.

58
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:36,756
You have not yet given them to me.

59
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:41,428
A birthday is a great event.

60
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:45,261
Had your mom give birth
to you a day earlier or later..

61
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:47,098
..could we meet here today?

62

That is as per your dad.
This is now 1 and 3/4 sovereigns.

65
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:08,118
Who has added the 1/4 sovereign?
l added it.

66
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:11,454
Who for?For Snehalata!

67
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:18,698
ls it not a fortune to get gold

68
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:20,362
..on her birthday?

69
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:22,974
lt is a fortune alright.
But no none shall know that.

70
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,475
Give it to my dad. He
will doubt otherwise.

71
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:08,350
lt should not be left as such.

72
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:13,852
Teacher!Will you stop
your dancing for God's sake.

73
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,291
Will you just come

00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:17,692
Nothing is left unbroken!Teacher!

75
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:23,535
Will you explain me what has to be done?

76
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:26,864

Let her live Abubaker!
Aon't get the wrath of a woman.

There is no woman in
this world powerful enough to curse!

84
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:55,734
This building is gifted to Hassan Haji..

85

00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:01,168
lf some teacher jump and play..

00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:03,071
..all Hajis will fall down like debris.

88
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,571
Bhaskaran!l will be flat
under the debris.

89
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:13,908
Come dear! He will
look after it with care.

90
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:22,924

Mother likes it.
You will get what you have wished.

100
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,644
Will that be enough?
That is enough.

101
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:29,824
Where are you going Aevayani?

102
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,327
To your mother's paramour

Bow my dear to the deity.

Why do you resell it Papi?

109
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:47,338
You can bring it up,drink milk
and try to improve your health.

110
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:49,004
Aon't talk nonsense.

111
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:52,343
My father,grand father and
great grand father don't drink milk.

112
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:53,679
We will just buy
the cows and sell them.

113
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:56,118
Why should l bring
disgrace to that tradition?

114
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:57,280
lf you have prayed,
let us make a move.

115
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,187
We will have to hear
nonsense if we stay here.

124
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:49,072
The sponsor has gone
Why should l perform the offering?

125
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,407
My goddess !

126
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:57,582

00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:13,929
My dear !

00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:20,094
-Aarling
-Aad!

131
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:26,270
Brother !

132
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:30,274
Our dad has gone ,brother!

133
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:37,118
Oh God!

134
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:39,791
Aon't crowd around.
Give some relief to the dead man.

135
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:41,452
Give him some fresh air.

136
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:44,455
Panicker!Put him on the floor.

137
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,459
Aon't lay him on the bed for long!

138
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:00,304
Ask every one to go out!

139
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,809
Will you stop yelling?
Yell only when he is dead!

140
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:13,484
There is nothing to get panic.

141
00:13:13,692 --> 00:13:14,989
He was only having a nap.

142
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:19,496
l knew it at the temple.
l did not tell any one.Oh,Goddess!

143
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:23,064
My heart has burned!
Aon't shout like this for your age.

144
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,434
Why laugh like this?
ls it the time for that?

145
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:28,006
Nothing has happened to my dad.

146
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:30,337
Aon't kill my dad
by your hue and cry!

147
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:32,840
He knows when it is time to die!

148
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:36,512
Leave it.He has come back to life
when we thought he is dead.

149
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:39,176
lt is a good fortune!
Good fortune!

150
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,843
He might have gone
by the way you rushed in to see him!

151
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,181
Please move!

152
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:53,031
-Panicker!l am going!
-Why do you go now?

153
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,860
You came here in the
middle of your offering.

154
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:56,868
You do the rest of your offering here!

155
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:59,529
The oracle will determine
where to do the offering.

156
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:03,196
Aon't insult me.
Even the goddess will come running..

157
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:04,276
..if she hears one is
dead. Let alone the oracle!

158
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,868
My cow!

159
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,044
Am l done with?St.Antony?

160
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:17,049
My cow!

161
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:21,226
My cow with 1 1/2 horns!

162
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:27,994
What is it?
-My cow bought for 3000 Rs is gone!

163
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,727
Aidn't you tie the cow beforehand?

164
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:30,995
No, the cow asked me to go.

165
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:33,401
One is dead
and you want him to tie his cow?

166
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:37,736
You offer a vow to the goddess.
Your cow will come back.

167
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,175
The cow which is gone
will be back as it is.

168
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:41,405
That is right
lt will come in the reverse.

169
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:44,575
Let me lose another Rs 10

Aamn your concoction.
This has made your life bitter.

176
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:10,268
The cows and dogs are of the same kind.

177
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:11,770
Both won't stop !

178
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:13,771
Both don't know where they have born.

179
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:15,606
lt will be in the Hajiyar's stable.

180
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:19,443
l should have tied it before l went.
l should not have let it loose.

181
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:21,779
Gone is gone!
You have let it loose.

182
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,946
What is the use lamenting now?

183
00:15:31,897 --> 00:15:33,956
You didn't listen to what l have said.

184
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,966
What to listen?
Except that you want to go out..

185
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:39,133
..l will listen to whatever you say.

186
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:42,474
Why don't we go to my uncle's house?

187
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:43,801
Today there is the offering.

How beautiful it is
to see from the hill top!

189
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:50,313
lf it is before the rain
you could watch the rain bow!

190
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:53,977
What are you deprived of here?

191
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:56,981
Am l not looking after you well?
Are you not fed well?

192
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,487

00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:20,668
Atlast both have eloped
with some sons of dogs!

198
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:22,346
Aon't you have belief in me?

199
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:27,011
Allah!My dear pearl!

200
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,188

times more than you expect.

201
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:33,187
Yet l have some fear in me!

So l would not take you any where!

203
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:40,031
l will not allow any damn fellows
of this place to see you.

204
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:44,361
lf you want to see
the rainbow
there is a way.

205
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:51,875
Like this.Take some water
into your mouth and spit.

206
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:55,706
You can see the rainbow in it.
ln seven colors!

207
00:16:55,914 --> 00:16:57,211
But there should be sun!

208
00:16:58,751 --> 00:16:59,718
l can hear his wife laughing!

209
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:06,382
lf he knows we have seen her
he will kill us.

210
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:08,551
Let him kill!l want my cow back.

211
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:11,888
Let us do a thing!
lnstead of seeing Hajiyar..

212
00:17:11,997 --> 00:17:13,328
..let's go to the stable and see there.

213
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:15,900
Forget him!l want only my cow!

214
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:25,503
lt is not here!
-You can't trust him.

215
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:26,908
He will tie the cow out side.

216
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:30,846
lt may be on the otherside.
Climb up!

217
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:32,416
l will watch if hajiyar comes!

218
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:40,584
Oh,gosh!lt is a pit of cowdung!
Aon't jump in.

219
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,759
Some body has entered our cow shed !.

220
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:46,431
Have thieves entered
our place in this daylight?

221
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:48,930
Go in.They should not see you!

222
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:54,204
Who is it that entered
into our garden?

223
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:55,773
Aon't you know that
there is a woman living here?

224
00:17:56,408 --> 00:18:00,868
Who are those devils?
Allah!

225
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:02,674
Hajiyar!lt's only us!

226
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:06,785
l have lost my 3000Rs!

227
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,353
That cow has gone!
-lt is not in the cowdung pit.

228
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:12,447
Just have a look around!
lt will be here, some where.

229
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,784
On hearing the father
of Baskaran has died l ran to them.

230
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:19,363
l ignored every thing
At least my fate was like this

231
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:20,795
A time to die for him!

232
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,126
ls he dead?

233
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,972
l got the news from Abubaker!

234
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:38,809
Man can't stop it if God decides it.

235
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,984
Your people have not
started to come, is it not?

236
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:00,498
How nice was this man!

237
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:14,678
This article is good!
But the labour charge is much!

238
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:21,622
187Rs!-lf you insist,
l will reduce 1 Rupee.

239
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,853
Just because you are forcing to do.

240
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,525
ln a way, your profession is better.

241
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:28,199
Gold is an auspicious metal!

242
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:34,702
Ao you like it?
-Yes!-lt is 187 Rs.worth!

243
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:37,874
lt is nice ofcourse!
Yet,there is a design lately introduced..

244
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:39,375
..than this.That would have sufficient.

245
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:42,379
-What design?
-Like this!

246
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:45,884
Like this!

247
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,713
This is almost of that pattern!

248
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:53,546
Then there is another design
round and with spots on it.

249
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:56,227
That is what l have made on its side.

250
00:19:57,262 --> 00:20:02,063
Then there is a design like this.

251
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:05,393
lt is the design in the Tamil nadu
lt has not come here yet.

252
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:08,305
l can make similar to that!
lt is a matter of 5 days only!

253
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,739
Enough of that! You don't have
to make it round or lengthy.

254
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,743
This will do!lt is a very nice earrings!
Baskaran can go!

255
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:15,073
l will send the money to your house!

256
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:19,742
Have your tea and go!
-He has no time to have his tea!

257
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:22,916
lt is sack ful of gold
he has to melt and bend!

258
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:26,090
ls it not Baskaran?
-lt is not like that!

259
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,020
Are the earrings ready ?
lt is ready!-Let me see!

260
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:33,930
l want my chain to melt and remodel it!

261
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:36,263
Not now.l will tell
when it is time to do that.

262
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:38,426
lt is better to make a new one,
than melt it and remake it.

263
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:39,600
The quality will get dim.

264
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:41,932
What he says is right
Let not the quality be bad !

265
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:52,447
Baskaran!you do not know them!
They are mad after gold!

266
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,944
They want gold on hands, legs,
noses, and even in their mouths.

267
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:58,782
At this rate,they will melt me and sell.

268
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:02,956
You can go.

269
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,977
What have you done dad?

270
00:21:20,178 --> 00:21:22,476
You should not have told mom
before Baskarettan all that!

271
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:26,811
He is a gold smith.
You are of an astrologer!

272
00:21:27,352 --> 00:21:29,149
The astroleger is your dad!

273
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:32,486
l can understand
what you are imagining!

274
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,821
Arawing on the palm like this..

275
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,823
..would not have done,in front of me!

276
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:40,157
Wash it away
if you have any thing in your mind!

277
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:41,898
lf not,it will become stain in your mind!

278
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:46,163
Aren't you ashamed
to tell all this to your kid?

279
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:49,331
lf l kick. You mom and
daughter will be on the ground!

280
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:50,736
What has happened here
to kick us?

281
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,674
l kick you, just to
avoid any thing happen!

282
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:58,574
What has happened dear?

283
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:02,179
l talked with Baskarettan!

284
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:04,351
Only that is all happened?

285
00:22:05,223 --> 00:22:08,351
You can talk!
lf you talk with your neighbors..

286
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,525
..the sky will not fall down!

287
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:16,857
lt suits you well!
A swing should also be made.

288
00:23:57,836 --> 00:24:00,703
lf you go in this night to
your home somebody may watch!

289
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:04,635
lf someone watch
that will make things easy.

290
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:06,040
Our marriage will take place soon!

291
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:07,908
My dad has started suspecting us.

292
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:11,141
One day l will hit your father.

293
00:24:58,563 --> 00:25:02,021
What is it dad?

294
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:08,969
Will you smoke beedi?-Beedi?No!

295
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:11,542
Exhale!Ao it!

296
00:25:15,747 --> 00:25:17,214
-A little?-No.

297
00:25:20,585 --> 00:25:22,553
What is the problem here?

298
00:25:22,754 --> 00:25:27,487
Aad asks me if l smoke beedi.
-lt is not her,it is me.

Not yet over? Washing clothes
can be later! You come fast!

302
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:53,247
The boy is from Thripunithura!

303
00:25:53,952 --> 00:25:57,752
He maintains the gold business
of his forefathers even now.

304
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:01,259
He is also educated.
Where is she?

305
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,087
Put those washed clothes
on the line.

306
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,770
Whoever sees her will like her!
we will have some way out!

307
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:20,777
You have to look into his matter too!

308
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,842
l have enough girls for him in this!

309
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:25,940
Let us find out!
-No.l know to find out my girl!

310
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:28,776
As a sample, you look
for the man of Thripunithura!

311
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:37,460
l saw him coming!
ls anything fixed?-Are you mad?

312
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,859
He will bring some bogus man's details..

313
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:43,458
..get a few rupees,and go away as usual.
That is all.

314
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:48,462
He was asking mom
if there can't be a mutual exchange

315
00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:51,804
The mutual exchange will not work out.

316
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:55,138
What l called you
was not for this!

317
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:56,644
Ao you have some coconut oil to give me?

318
00:26:56,848 --> 00:27:00,477
Nothing left. l used it up
to prepare Pappadam.

319
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:01,850
Will kerosene do?

320
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:10,987
You have to make
the handle covered with gold.

321
00:27:11,696 --> 00:27:14,665
From that, golden bells
has to be hung up! That is all!

322
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:17,835
l will need at least
1 sovereign for that.

323
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:20,336
My goddess!One sovereign!

324
00:27:20,705 --> 00:27:23,003
All l want is that the sword
should like made of gold.

325
00:27:23,274 --> 00:27:24,502
lt is the goddess's sword!

326
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,675
Why do the goddess need
a gold covered sword?

327
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:30,514
You oracle has,to hold it
with pride,is it not?

328
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:34,516
Oracle,do one thing!

329
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,848
Ask Panicker to do it as an offering.

330
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:41,021
lt is not a big thing for him.
-That is okay!

331
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:45,523
When it is an offering
will it be easy to perform?

332
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:50,864
Panicker is very stingy!
But he believes you, that l know.

333
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:54,698
Let us give a try ,is it not?
-Let us try.

334
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:17,225
lt is not that l have the gold!
All l have is a daughter!

335
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:21,725
l can give 9 sovereigns
for her to have God's blessings!

336
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:26,400
l said 9 sovereigns was an
out of excitement! Aon't take it!

337
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:32,240
A gold covering and
some bells. That will be taken care of!

338
00:28:32,944 --> 00:28:34,070
l have only one request.

339
00:28:34,612 --> 00:28:37,581
Oracle should do the prance
and say to the goddess..

340
00:28:39,617 --> 00:28:43,576
..that her marriage should
be a great pomp and at the earliest.

341
00:28:43,688 --> 00:28:47,749
The natives should envy seeing that

342
00:28:50,962 --> 00:28:54,261
ls it not greed?
Marriage should be performed isn't it?

343
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,424
Not enough !

344
00:28:56,634 --> 00:29:01,037
l am greedy! l am stingy, lousy
guy and would not spend

345
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:05,269
These are the words of some big
bosses and some neighbors

346
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,878
They want to witness that,
and that is essential for me.

347
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:11,771
All will happen! Panicker
can pray now - My goddess!

348
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:24,895
Madhavan Nair! See in
the tamil news paper..

349
00:29:24,996 --> 00:29:26,463
..about the cattle market
in the Pollachi side!

350
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:29,800
l used to read that once!
When the business was dull l stopped

351
00:29:30,835 --> 00:29:32,564
Not in Pollachi side.There is in
Thakala nad Thenga pattanam

352
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:33,637
Ao you want that to be read?

353
00:29:33,738 --> 00:29:37,799
No.No.No.Those
cows there are like the oxen!

354
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,643
Shall l give you a few Vadas(Eats)?

355
00:29:39,844 --> 00:29:42,642
What for ? to play with them?
My stomache is full.

356
00:29:42,747 --> 00:29:45,409
l had the offerings and fruits
from Panicker's place.

357
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:47,815
There was a worship
in Panicker's house.

358
00:29:48,086 --> 00:29:50,816
The oracle preformed well.
His prance was superb!

359
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:55,989
No body has born in this earth
to outsmart, oracle in his prance.

360
00:30:05,036 --> 00:30:06,094
Lousy women!

361
00:30:06,204 --> 00:30:09,173
Curse of this land is
the women with loose morals ..

362
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:13,176
and the men who are
after them smiling at them like you!

363
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:17,441
Auring the next committee
These should be driven out..

364
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:18,675
..and springle cow dung
to do the purification.

365
00:30:31,062 --> 00:30:34,691
The goddess will be watching
my evil deeds!

366
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:40,197
At the end,she will
settle the scores with me

367
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:43,373
That would be a
real bad day for me !

368
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:46,703
Tell me the truth!
Aid you pray for that Snehalatha today?

369
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:51,037
Not only for her
if l pray for one who do not have love..

370
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:54,050
..there is no use.
This is the iron age.

371
00:30:57,822 --> 00:31:03,727
Baskaran has some love for her.
They are in love.

372
00:31:04,495 --> 00:31:07,225
Just to avoid that
Panicker has played this game.

373
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,462
Should l be an accomplice for that?

374
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:13,060
l am the only one
who hasn't done any sin in this world.

375
00:31:13,171 --> 00:31:15,332
Why did you then prance
and jump into the pond?

376
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,240
l could not put the brakes
while prancing! That is it.

377
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:34,247
-Madavanchettan? What is this in hand
-A few vadas for you.

378
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:35,920
l am in a little hurry!

379
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:41,593
When l heard the knock
l knew it was somebody with urgency

380
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,865
To tell the truth, l
came to see you, oracle!

381
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:47,767
What is that for?
-lt was regarding a prayer!

382
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:49,370
l will tell you tomorrow!

383
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:51,704
Having come so far hiding
Why do you postpone it ?

384
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:53,106
Come and sit inside,nair.

385
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:55,270
There are rain bearing clouds.
We will have it tomorrow.

386
00:32:57,041 --> 00:33:02,001
There are only 3 good astrologers
l am very busy

387
00:33:02,113 --> 00:33:07,517
But since you have come and called me . . .

388
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:30,536
Sneha latha!-What do you want Baskaran?

389
00:33:31,576 --> 00:33:36,036
l wanted some husk!
-ls that all?

390
00:33:36,247 --> 00:33:41,048
Sneha Latha!Get some husk for him.

391
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:47,555
You have a lot of burnt husk
in your house .

392
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:08,312
We had a sackful of husk.
Why did you go nad ask them?

393
00:34:09,013 --> 00:34:10,571
Aon't interfere in things
which does not concern you!

394
00:34:10,948 --> 00:34:13,746
l need raw husk
to melt 16 carat gold!You know that?

395
00:34:16,954 --> 00:34:18,854
Oracle!-My god!

396
00:34:18,956 --> 00:34:20,253
Oracle! Stop there!

397
00:34:22,527 --> 00:34:25,257
l have given the hint to you
to make the gold for the sword.

398
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,928
But you have got it done with
some one else. What is your idea?

399
00:34:28,299 --> 00:34:29,596
Ao not be indecent.

400
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:33,601
l wanted to get it done by you.
Panicker told me no.

401
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:37,101
The offering was
for his daughter to get her married.

402
00:34:37,475 --> 00:34:41,104
l prayed for that too.
lt will happen if l prayed.

403
00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:45,779
At this juncture,
l do not think,you will get her.

404
00:34:46,651 --> 00:34:49,779
He has some other plans in his mind!

405
00:34:49,987 --> 00:34:52,785
Some proposals are in the air
to my knowledge.

406
00:34:54,158 --> 00:34:56,126
They wouldn't have fixed
any one for her. Aid they?

407
00:34:56,494 --> 00:34:57,961
Why to wait for the decision?

408
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:00,127
These are not things to be prolonged!

409
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:02,798
lf you love each other
ask her to come with you!

410
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:05,800
We are there for you in this place.

411
00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:08,563
But,she should come with you when called.

412
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:09,970
Or else,the matter will stink!

413
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:30,153
Why are you annoyed with
me that an oracle has pranced?

414
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:32,989
l will tell you what l have in my mind.

415
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:36,661
l can't stand if some body marry you!

416
00:35:36,868 --> 00:35:39,393
l am ready to come
with you anywhere you wish.

417
00:35:39,537 --> 00:35:41,505
But not before Savitri's marriage.

418
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:44,842
lt is wrong, if l come with you
before your sister's marriage.

419
00:35:47,211 --> 00:35:49,577
ln any case, our marriage
will not take place decently.

420
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:52,514
l am sure of that!
-What will we do then?

421
00:35:55,887 --> 00:35:58,947
There is a short cut for that.
-What is that?

422
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,182
That is a little improper way.

423
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:03,858
lf we show some respect to it
we will be saved.

424
00:36:04,061 --> 00:36:05,688
lf not,Baskarettan will have its shame!

425
00:36:12,904 --> 00:36:15,464
You tell the fact.
-lf you are bold enough..

426
00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:18,872
..tie the sacred thread
No one will take me away then.

427
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:22,038
Are you telling me the truth?

428
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:24,371
Make a nice chain and put it on my neck!

429
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:26,709
My parents should
be astonished seeing that!

430
00:36:27,151 --> 00:36:31,554
At first,there will some tussle!
l will endure that!Enough?

431
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:36,219
l did not know that
you will so bold enough! Sneha Latha!

432
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:38,721
The obstinacy of my parents will..

433
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:41,059
..vanish away when they see the gold
They won't oppose then!

434
00:36:41,332 --> 00:36:42,890
You have to make
such a chain for me.

435
00:36:45,937 --> 00:36:49,065
1 sovereign of gold is enough
for a chain! l will give that!

436
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:51,465
Enough l sovereign is enough !

437
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:55,236
lf l take it to them, my dad
can melt it just by looking at it!

438
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:58,572
lf our matter has to be settled
you will have to spend more

439
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,916
10 sovereigns of gold
has to be spend on that,at least!

440
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:05,748
10 sovereigns! Ao you know
how much will it cost for that?

441
00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:08,585
Then we will lament
about our poverty!

442
00:37:13,631 --> 00:37:15,030
This is not going to happen!

443
00:37:15,132 --> 00:37:16,759
We are not going to get married.

444
00:37:17,468 --> 00:37:21,427
l wanted to make you
a big man before my dad1

445
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:24,437
After the marriage,
the gold will come back to you!What then?

446
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:30,107
You said it right! lt is
not that l can't make it.

447
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:32,609
lt is only a matter of some time.

448
00:37:33,517 --> 00:37:35,451
lf the matters are like this..

449
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:37,448
..what is the assurance
that the marriage will happen?

450
00:37:37,655 --> 00:37:40,556
Assurance?lf they ask me,
l will tell them,that the chain..

451
00:37:40,658 --> 00:37:41,955
..was given by Baskarettan!That is all.

452
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:47,461
Forget that!Never mind!

453
00:37:47,832 --> 00:37:50,460
Why do we ponder over
the matter which is not to happen?

454
00:37:50,668 --> 00:37:53,296
l have told nothing to you
nor you heard anything from me.

455
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:57,298
You have told me
and l have heard it.

456
00:37:58,843 --> 00:38:01,471
Only 10 sovereigns!
l will try.

457
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:02,972
lf l try ,l will make it.

458
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:07,545
You are dearer to me
than the 10 sovereigns!

459
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:44,112
To melt the gold sovereign in fire ..

460
00:38:44,221 --> 00:38:46,519
To melt the gold sovereign in fire ..

461
00:38:46,624 --> 00:38:48,854
To make an exquisite chain ...

The smith reared it feeding provender

470
00:39:56,293 --> 00:39:57,590
The goldsmith ..

00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:01,930
l have a lazy duck called desire in mind!

472
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:05,695
The smith reared it feeding provender

473
00:40:05,803 --> 00:40:07,100
The goldsmith

474
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:12,107
Gave it lotus, millets and sesame

475
00:40:12,476 --> 00:40:15,877
Gave it lotus, millets and sesame

476
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:21,282
The egg laid for the
maiden young one is golden

477
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:25,119
That was a golden egg

478
00:40:29,827 --> 00:40:34,560
To melt the gold sovereign in fire ..

479
00:40:34,665 --> 00:40:37,065
To melt the gold sovereign in fire ..

480
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:39,398

The loving jasmine in mind
had a gem studded wick

484
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:25,610
The flower in that was plucked by a girl

485
00:41:25,716 --> 00:41:27,013
By a girl ...

486
00:41:27,384 --> 00:41:31,514
The loving jasmine in mind
had a gem studded wick

487
00:41:31,622 --> 00:41:35,285
The flower in that was plucked by a girl

488
00:41:35,392 --> 00:41:36,518
By a girl ...

00:41:36,727 --> 00:41:41,528
The ruby fingers clapped
The ring fingers dashed!

490
00:41:41,732 --> 00:41:45,293
The ruby fingers clapped
The ring fingers dashed!

491
00:41:45,402 --> 00:41:54,868
Before l could wink

You put out the torch!

502
00:43:00,311 --> 00:43:03,109
Why don't you come
to see the dance of tigers?

503
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:08,281
The tiger in this is mightier than those.
-What is this?-A chain!

504
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:11,786
This is worth 10 sovereigns!
When l finish this..

505
00:43:11,889 --> 00:43:13,447
..there will be a earth quake here.

506
00:43:13,991 --> 00:43:17,620
Every body will have
a real jolt then!

507
00:43:17,861 --> 00:43:20,853
Will you be also get the jolt?
l am the who jolts it!

508
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:40,480
Things are going to be serious!

509
00:43:40,851 --> 00:43:42,478
l will ask Sneha latha to come with me!

510
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:44,988
Will you back me up in that?

511
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:53,491
Will she come with you?
Sure,her dad will bring her before me..

512
00:43:53,697 --> 00:43:54,823
..and plead me to take care of her!

513
00:43:55,366 --> 00:43:57,334
Once,l asked my girl
to come with me.

514
00:43:57,868 --> 00:44:00,996
She did not come with me. That
is why l became an oracle.

515
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:02,670
You should not have
the same fate as mine.

516
00:44:03,707 --> 00:44:07,234
l have found a way for that.

517
00:44:07,544 --> 00:44:09,842
l am also a man.

518
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:15,680
No.No.No.That is bad.

519
00:44:18,222 --> 00:44:19,018
Aid you marry her?

520
00:44:19,923 --> 00:44:22,255
lt is in the process!
Will you be with me?

521
00:44:22,393 --> 00:44:25,851
l am ready!
Should l prance now?

522
00:44:30,234 --> 00:44:34,364
lt is worth 10 sovereigns!
Nothing more or nothing less.

523
00:44:38,909 --> 00:44:42,538
l tell you now to you!
l have used the gold meant for Savitri..

524
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:43,874
..and made this chain for you!

525
00:44:44,915 --> 00:44:46,712
lt is just for you and me.

526
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:52,279
Savitri will be the happiest of all
when you become my wife.

527
00:44:53,924 --> 00:44:59,726
Shall l put it on you?
l shouldn't have asked

528
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:00,887
Yes it is because of you!

529
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:04,891
lf you were not there,
who should have l loved?

530
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:23,580
Your husband will get cured soon.
-ls n't it enough!

531
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:25,578
Aeath will occur now and then.

532
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:27,584
lt will go off without doing any harm.

533
00:45:28,292 --> 00:45:30,760
Yet,l can see danger
lurking somewhere.

534
00:45:31,295 --> 00:45:34,264
You should have a
watchful eye on your son.

535
00:45:34,364 --> 00:45:39,427
Oh,Goddess!
-Fear not!l am with you!Enough?-Yes.

536
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:42,763
Keep the gift for me here.
Place a good note.

537
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:44,771
l have only a 10Rs note.
-That is good enough.

538
00:46:08,999 --> 00:46:11,297
You do not hurt her asking questions.

539
00:46:11,401 --> 00:46:16,134
She has told me everything!
God Mahadeva!Narayana!

540
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:25,307
This is not a very big thing.

541
00:46:26,183 --> 00:46:28,310
He has only given her a present

542
00:46:28,752 --> 00:46:30,982
When he offered it to her
how could she deny it?

543
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:37,484
Aoes any body know or seen you?
-No mom.-That will do.

544
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:44,497
l know, about him,
he is a nice fellow.

545
00:46:45,035 --> 00:46:49,495
See the virtue of his quality!
l was stunned, when he said 10

546
00:46:49,606 --> 00:46:55,340
l got it from him boldly!
l was not in a normal mood then.-ls it?

547
00:46:56,246 --> 00:46:59,511
You just consider this
as a brotherly affection.

548
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:07,013
A brother need not be born
from the same womb.ls it?-Why?

549
00:47:09,226 --> 00:47:11,524
There are exactly 10 sovereigns!

550
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:19,034
He is a gold smith with brotherly love
and magnanimous too.

551
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:23,028
Aictum says what one hand gives
and the other hand recieves

552
00:47:23,407 --> 00:47:26,376
So,Even she do not know
that she has got it.

553
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:32,539
l do not know if you remember?

554
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:36,548
l was only 18 then.

555
00:47:37,421 --> 00:47:42,222
l had the same brotherly love
with the Variath Soudamini..

556
00:47:42,759 --> 00:47:46,718
..and l gave her a present
based on the love.

557
00:47:47,264 --> 00:47:48,993
People have said what not!

558
00:47:49,099 --> 00:47:51,897
Only we know,
that it was a brotherly affection.

559
00:47:52,436 --> 00:47:57,396
Aon't laugh! lf you
attempt to ogle with him..

560
00:47:58,108 --> 00:47:59,405
..since he have given this
l will chop you off, and throw you

561
00:48:01,345 --> 00:48:06,248
lt is a good fortune for them
to have a gold smith as neighbor.

562
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:26,434
What a tread,god?
l can't find a way to tread back.

563
00:48:32,643 --> 00:48:38,445
Come ,sit here
-Give me a tea and a couple of bananas.

564
00:48:41,551 --> 00:48:43,451
Abu baker! Aance is
at full swing, upstairs!

565
00:48:43,553 --> 00:48:45,612
After a while,
every thing will fall completely down.

566
00:48:45,822 --> 00:48:48,620
Let it get damaged.
lt is a great feeling knowing..

567
00:48:48,825 --> 00:48:49,792
..that it is all because of a girl.

568
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:53,790
Panicker seems
to be in a good mood today.

569
00:48:54,064 --> 00:48:55,793
How can l be not happy?

570
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:59,963
ln my life,l had only two wishes.

571
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:06,632
First,To see my daughter
gets married to a man from the gulf.

572
00:49:06,843 --> 00:49:08,640
That is in the process.

573
00:49:10,347 --> 00:49:15,307
Next one a chain for her
no matter how much l suffer

574
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:18,478
l managed to get it done also

575
00:49:22,693 --> 00:49:25,321
How is this?
-Looks nice!-lt is 10 sovereigns!

576
00:49:26,196 --> 00:49:31,156
True?Let me see!
lt weighs at least 15 sovereigns!

577
00:49:31,368 --> 00:49:32,835
-ls it?
-Give here

578
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:36,999
lt is long time, she tells
that she wants to have a chain of gold.

579
00:49:37,374 --> 00:49:41,174
lt is her wish, afterall.
Panicker has made it!

580
00:49:41,545 --> 00:49:46,505
You are the real affectionate father!

581
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:48,515
Good work!l agree.

582
00:49:56,226 --> 00:49:58,251
l wanted to get it done by you!

583
00:49:58,562 --> 00:50:01,690
Then Bageerathi's relative
came to my house.

584
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:05,029
She told there is a nice gold smith
in their neighborhood

585
00:50:05,402 --> 00:50:07,267
Sneha Latha told,it can be him
to make that chain.

586
00:50:10,741 --> 00:50:14,040
A proposal has come for her.
l am busy with that.

587
00:50:16,913 --> 00:50:22,545
You come with me.
l have some thing to say. Get up!

588
00:50:27,157 --> 00:50:32,561
lt is gulf matter. Let's hope
it will happen!lt's her wish too.

589
00:50:32,929 --> 00:50:35,056
They will come here
to see her in a couple of days!

590
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:37,461
You have to do one thing.

591
00:50:37,934 --> 00:50:39,561
On the day they come
you have to lend us..

592
00:50:39,669 --> 00:50:42,900
..two brass vessels,a brass goblet
and two chairs from house.

593
00:50:43,106 --> 00:50:45,074
We should have something
to show them as ours.

594
00:50:45,275 --> 00:50:48,244
Showing a chain of 10 sovereigns
to him is not a big thing

595
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:51,404
You should be my cat's paw.
He is from the gulf.

596
00:50:51,782 --> 00:50:53,750
There is enough demand
for gold smiths there.

597
00:50:54,117 --> 00:50:56,244
She will take care of you.
That l can manage.

598
00:51:18,642 --> 00:51:23,944
What happened?
What is it Bhaskaran?

599
00:51:26,817 --> 00:51:30,947
lt is epilepsy, no doubt
-What happened?

600
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:32,783
Nothing to worry.
lt is a light giddiness.

601
00:51:32,989 --> 00:51:34,786
Teacher can go and dance.
We will take care of it.

602
00:51:46,236 --> 00:51:47,567
You lie down.You will fall if you get up.

603
00:51:47,671 --> 00:51:49,798
No.Let him get up and sit.
Let him get some breeze.

604
00:51:50,674 --> 00:51:53,370
-Will this happen quite often?
-l am seeing this for the first time.

605
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:56,138
Panicker told him some thing
and he fell down that l saw.

606
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:57,576
Ao you feel giddy now?

607
00:51:57,681 --> 00:52:01,139
lf he is giddy he
can't sit like this. He will fall down.

608
00:52:21,705 --> 00:52:26,005
He has jumped in.Just now.

609
00:52:43,894 --> 00:52:46,362
Sneha Latha!Sneha Latha!

610
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:56,038
What dad?
-He has jumped in.

611
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:57,863
What?- He has jumped in. Come

612
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:15,382
We have to catch him
red handed and call the public

613
00:53:16,092 --> 00:53:20,552
We will show the coconut bunches
and say he is a coconut thief

614
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:25,067
Who is it?

615
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:32,067
-No body is here.
-Pestle

616
00:53:32,442 --> 00:53:35,002
You might have dreamt that
you have jumped the fence .

617
00:53:35,111 --> 00:53:36,237
That is what you
were telling in the sleep.

618
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:38,472
l have heard him
jumping that l know.

619
00:53:44,187 --> 00:53:46,917
At this midnight,you are troubling tohers
You are mad

620
00:53:47,624 --> 00:53:50,252
-Come dear.
-Stop!l am coming.

621
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:55,588
You shut the door and go to sleep!

622
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:59,930
Aon't open it if you
hear any sound.Shut it.

623
00:54:02,305 --> 00:54:05,103
When he jumped in,
has he caught in the fence?

624
00:54:05,308 --> 00:54:07,606
Let him be caught!
You come and sleep!

625
00:54:08,144 --> 00:54:09,111
What a man?

626
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:40,141
Has your parents
changed seeing the gold ?

627
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:43,636
lf your dad is poison,
l am more poisonous than him.

628
00:54:43,847 --> 00:54:45,474
Baskarettan,me!
-Aon't talk.

629
00:54:46,516 --> 00:54:50,145
lf l wanted l could
kill you or destroy you.

630
00:54:51,187 --> 00:54:53,985
But l happened to like you.

631
00:54:56,693 --> 00:54:58,820
l will give you another chance.

632
00:54:59,362 --> 00:55:02,661
Tomorrow,l will come
and call you before others!

633
00:55:03,033 --> 00:55:06,332
You should come
with me as my wife then.

634
00:55:09,205 --> 00:55:11,173
l will come.-You have to.

635
00:55:13,543 --> 00:55:15,568
My God!What am l hearing?

636
00:55:16,212 --> 00:55:18,680
No body here will object
if you marry any girl.

637
00:55:18,882 --> 00:55:20,179
Tell me who she is?

638
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:24,578
lt is you oracle,
that making my son
to act as you like.

639
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:26,519
Me?My goddess.

640
00:55:27,123 --> 00:55:29,853
You could have kept it a secret.
Why do you gather people ?

641
00:55:30,226 --> 00:55:32,694
You lie simply
as if dead for the whole day.

642
00:55:32,962 --> 00:55:36,022
Our son Baskaran is going
to bring a girl into our house.

643
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:40,369
You could have told
me atleast. Who is she?

644
00:55:42,572 --> 00:55:44,631
lf l tell you that,
you will get annoyed at me!

645
00:55:44,741 --> 00:55:47,767
l will not be annoyed at you.
ls it Sneha Latha chechi?

646
00:55:52,916 --> 00:55:56,545
All we have is our son.
He is going to do this atrocious act.

647
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:59,548
You all kill me!
That will be better.

648
00:56:00,757 --> 00:56:01,724
You go!

649
00:56:06,262 --> 00:56:07,058
What?

650
00:56:09,766 --> 00:56:13,065
Aad have to forgive me.
You have to bless me then.

651
00:56:16,439 --> 00:56:17,667
This is a matter
of my prestige also.

652
00:56:19,609 --> 00:56:21,736
You have come
to my court yard for you to play.

653
00:56:22,946 --> 00:56:25,073
We have been living here, with prestige.

654
00:56:25,448 --> 00:56:27,075
We are not like you
cheating the people..

655
00:56:27,283 --> 00:56:28,750
..and stealing others' gold.

656
00:56:28,852 --> 00:56:29,841
You have to be careful,when you talk.

657
00:56:29,953 --> 00:56:31,250
We gold smiths are truthful.

658
00:56:31,354 --> 00:56:33,015
l,gold smith Gopalan's son
have never lived otherwise.

659
00:56:33,123 --> 00:56:35,489
lt is not right
if you behave like mangoose and snake.

660
00:56:35,558 --> 00:56:38,356
You call your daughter and ask her
We will know the fact then.

661
00:56:38,461 --> 00:56:40,019
Why do you come here and prance?

662
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:42,257
This is my family problem.
l will take care of it.

663
00:56:42,365 --> 00:56:44,595
l can not be without prancing
l am the oracle of this place.

664
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:46,759
You come here brother.
Ao not quarrel.

665
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:48,767
Aad and daughter, don't try to fool me.

666
00:56:49,005 --> 00:56:53,271
Ask her to honour
her word or return my chain.

667
00:56:58,882 --> 00:57:02,283
Chain?What chain?
-The 10 sovereigns chain what l gave !

668
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:05,388
She asked for it,and for her
l spent every thing..

669
00:57:05,488 --> 00:57:06,682
what l have earned and made the chain.

670
00:57:13,163 --> 00:57:15,222
lf you are a real man
get that chain and come!

671
00:57:15,331 --> 00:57:18,528
Chain!He gave my daughter pestle

672
00:57:20,236 --> 00:57:21,669
She has born from my womb!

673
00:57:21,771 --> 00:57:24,638
-Your womb is very vast and large!

674
00:57:38,855 --> 00:57:39,651
Son of a bitch !

675
00:58:30,406 --> 00:58:34,365
What is it Gopalettan?-My God!

676
00:58:36,246 --> 00:58:37,713
What is all this, Panicker?

677
00:58:37,914 --> 00:58:39,472
People are watching!

678
00:58:39,582 --> 00:58:41,550
lf you were in my place
a murder would have happened here.

679
00:58:41,918 --> 00:58:46,378
-lf they are in love,call her and ask.
We will know - Call her!

680
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:48,991
Let her tell at my face
that l have not given any chain to her.

681
00:58:49,092 --> 00:58:51,390
We do not have to convince any body.-No.

682
00:58:51,594 --> 00:58:54,222
What if you tell that?
We have been compelled to call her.

683
00:58:54,597 --> 00:58:56,462
Why are you getting upset?
Call her here.

684
00:58:56,833 --> 00:58:59,233
A major girl's words have
enough value.

685
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:01,226
This won't end up here
without calling her.

686
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:02,565
You need not have to shout like this.

687
00:59:08,444 --> 00:59:09,911
Tell us what is the truth.

688
00:59:10,113 --> 00:59:12,138
We only believe your words.

689
00:59:12,282 --> 00:59:13,909
No body has gifted anything to me.

690
00:59:14,284 --> 00:59:15,911
On that pretext,
no body has to come here.

691
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:23,416
Move away.
-Are you satisfied now?

692
00:59:23,793 --> 00:59:25,693
We are also humans.
Let us live.

693
00:59:28,298 --> 00:59:30,926
You liar girl!
You have stabbed me, in my chest.

694
00:59:31,301 --> 00:59:33,098
10 sovereigns are peanuts to me!

695
00:59:33,369 --> 00:59:36,429
l don't want your girl,
you craze after gold!

696
00:59:36,973 --> 00:59:40,602
Mind you,there is one
up there,who is watching every thing.

697
00:59:56,159 --> 01:00:01,961
You drink it, son!
Forget what has happened!

698
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:03,956
Wipe away, every thing from your mind.

699
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:08,799
You have escaped,from those
canny people.

700
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:13,206
God will punish them for that.

701
01:00:14,344 --> 01:00:17,313
lf you are at loss
take all my gold and sell.

702
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:18,641
You do not mind it

703
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:30,153
Aon't play foul games !

704
01:00:32,362 --> 01:00:33,488
Will you give a chain?

705
01:00:35,098 --> 01:00:36,998
He would not give us. He
will give only to girls.

706
01:01:51,441 --> 01:01:53,909
He is from the gulf
who came in the tourist car.

707
01:01:55,445 --> 01:01:59,575
lf he likes her, the marriage
will take place this month itself.

708
01:02:01,451 --> 01:02:04,420
Forget every thing!
lf you have lost 10 sovereigns..

709
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:06,681
..you can make 15 sovereigns again.

710
01:02:06,789 --> 01:02:11,419
lt is not that oracle! You watch it,
when it reaches the climax..

711
01:02:11,627 --> 01:02:12,821
..the gold smith will show
his real power.

712
01:02:12,895 --> 01:02:15,762
Aon't hit or knock any more.
lt is stupidity.

713
01:02:15,965 --> 01:02:19,093
Your way was bit crooked.
What you have done is non sense.

714
01:02:19,302 --> 01:02:21,429
lf you do non sense,
any girl can fool you.

715
01:02:23,706 --> 01:02:26,937
Call him here.
They may have things to talk.

716
01:02:27,043 --> 01:02:29,102
Time has changed.
-l will do that.

717
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:34,512
Just imagine these
are all a good fortune.

718
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:37,610
Please come here for a moment.
-l will be back in a moment.

719
01:02:39,155 --> 01:02:41,123
You stay here,let me tell him something
