Listen,

64
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,591
first tip for picking up a new lingo

65
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:40,534
ln conversations,
begin with pretending...

66
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:43,071
that you're understanding
every word

67
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:47,639
lf you're asjed, what is this ?
you say, This

68
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:52,444
Pick up the last word and nod

69
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:53,548
This !

70
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:57,853
slowly, you begin to grasp words,
then one learns quickly

71
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:01,060
are you really grasping it
or, just nodding it away ?

72
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:36,152
so these two oldies
are also itching for a honeymoon

73
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:37,192
shut up, eat

74
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,898
Lunch is served already ?
- Long enough to have turned cold

75
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:43,333
where have you been ?
- Telephone booth. no networj signal

76
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:47,564
got through ?
- ls she ever at home... spoon, man ?

77
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:51,707
water therapy is so good, so good,
you jnow...it's my speciality

78
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:55,774
before our wedding,
vicky had a rash of pimples

79
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:59,710
vicky, why are you mauling my hand,
you distracted my conversation

80
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:05,580
l forced vicky to drinj so much water,
l finished off all the pimples

81
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:09,988
now looj, he has
a really nice, smooth face, no ?

82
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:14,695
your wife isn't eating ?
- no, she isn't hungry

83
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:18,296
yours was... a love marriage ?
- no, arranged marriage

84
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:20,469
ours was a love-cum-arranged marriage

85
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:22,830
we met in college

86
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:26,135
lt was her first year,
l was in third year

87
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:31,147
l went to a girls' college,
so we could not meet

88
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:50,300
what are they doing ?

89
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:55,073
you thinj they practise ?
- l don't jnow

90
00:07:56,642 --> 00:08:00,442
l still can't believe that you havent told
your parents, we've got married

91
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:02,473
l want to surprise them

92
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:05,643
you assume they will be
surprised, pleasantly ?

93
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:07,581
l hope so

94
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:10,446
lt'd be tragicif they died
of shock instead

95
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,124
so bad

96
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:13,255
hold this

97
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:28,671
can somebody please
call the police ?

98
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:35,110
what happened ?
- The drugs these foreigners use

99
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:37,047
That woman says,

100
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:43,386
she went loojing for a cafe.
There, two boys attacked her

101
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:47,021

-They tried to push her into the loo

102
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:51,889
Then a lady in a cape dropped out of
the sjy... lije a superhero character

103
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:55,925

l bring to you,
'' Moments of Love ''

149
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:09,454
Today's letter is about a couple
who were made for each other

150
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,962
soulmates, as they say in english

151
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:15,995
Dadar, Parsi colony.
The year is 1986

152
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:18,326
aspi, come on darling,
you're getting late again

153
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:22,404
aspi, it's a new act with you everyday

154
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:28,742
come out. you thinj if you hide
you won't have to go to school ?

155
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:29,914
stand straight

156
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:32,879
l don't want to go...
- what do you mean !

157
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:33,914
l just don't want to

158
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:39,084
aspi's morning raga was all about
finding excuses for playing truant,

159
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:44,123
sometimes here, sometimes there,
he'd looj for new places to hide,

160
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:48,594
he was as scared of school as a
rabid dog of water

161
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:52,295
but why was he so scared ?

162
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:58,276
he wasn't a failure at school,
neither was he popular

163
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:02,880
friendless, he found sympathy nowhere
and was nicknamed ''spectacular'',

164
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:05,616
his life, spent hiding behind
his thick eyeglasses was wasting away,

165
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:10,450
Days went by but aspi jnew
things would never change

166
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:13,951
as his loneliness pursued him
as relentlessly as his shadow

167
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,387
The rest was routine

168
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:28,600
Lyrics by gulzar,

00:13:57,136 --> 00:13:57,727
aspi

174
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:01,600
lt was the day when halley's comet
streajed through earth's sjies

175
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:04,634
what happened next,
may have been the comet's effect

176
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:26,558
Their eyesight improved drastically.
The spectacles were not required anymore

177
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,160
and when their eyes met,

178
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:31,992
the gaze held...

179
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:34,102
in a realisation...

180
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,365
this was something special

181
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:37,906
after that everything changed

182
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:42,278
since that day, aspi and zara
have been together, till this day

183
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:49,187

00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:50,645

The sea is so vast and
l'm having a huge amount of fun.

187
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:23,216
vicky is treating me lije a princess.

188
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:28,216

Let's exchange notes when we return.

189
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:30,322

190
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:31,385
writing something ?

191
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:37,162
apostcard to shalini, to tell her
how much we're enjoying ourselves

192
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:39,363
but we've only arrived...

193
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:43,775

194
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:49,410

we'll be back in Delhi before the mail

195
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:54,753

l had a dream

196
00:15:56,922 --> 00:16:00,050

Then we come upon each other...

201
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:15,267
Then we're in bliss,

00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:35,886
Tears well up in my eyes

00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:40,121
Tears well up in my eyes

212
00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:57,839
Mujar'rar

213
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,410
not Mujar'rar... gahlib

214
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,773
Mujar'rar means encore,
once again, please. once more

215
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:09,315
and it isn't gahlib, he was ghalib

216
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:12,955

217
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:14,923

218
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:17,417

219
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:19,091

236
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:49,050
My uncle told me that
lndian girls are shy and coy

237
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:50,545
really ?

238
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:51,919

239
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:55,158
My back...
Must've been the bus ride

240
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:59,629

That feels so good

246
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:26,121
you are a talented woman

247
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,539
so, how many women
have you slept with ?

248
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,041

249
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,305
bunty...?

250
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:53,880
Thanjs !

251
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:57,418

253
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:04,752
Lizard

254
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:13,697
not fair, you're cheating.
- everything is fair in love and war

255
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:19,206
Tickling won't worj anymore

256
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:23,612
now try me

257
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:28,280
Today's story is about the
eternal battle of the sexes

258
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:32,423
now, Partho and Milly are embroiled
in this age-old battle

259
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,782
The beginning of their romance
was enchanting

260
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:38,219
They loved each other dearly,
then marriage was proposed...

261
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:41,625
and everything changed.
you are listening to radio Mirchi 98.3 fM

262
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,032
son...

263
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:47,061
so she decides
when you'll get to marry ?

264
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:52,637
once married, they all change.
so, you use fear to rein the man in

265
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:57,245
give your woman as much as an inch...
- he'll taje yards, mind you

266
00:21:57,449 --> 00:22:00,111
having sown seeds, the mothers
stood aside to let the bitterness harvest

267
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:01,681
The contest continued

268
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:18,633
comes a moment when she loojs
into his eyes, feels pity for him...

269
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:20,529
gives up the fight

270
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:30,304
what is love ?
freedom or bondage ? beware...

271
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:33,916
sometimes love is about
sacrificing one's identity, surrendering...

272
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:39,083
to be moulded by your lover.
from the film 'Maine Pyar kiya'...

273
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:43,791
scored by raam Laxman.
s.P. balasubramaniam sang this song

274
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:48,423
what are you doing ?
a good wife follows her husband

275
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:32,933
Morning

276
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:30,727
no more of all this, shilpa.
l won't tolerate this any longer

277
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:34,132
whatever happened before our wedding,
l don't care

278
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:38,137
but now you're my wife and
you will behave accordingly

279
00:24:39,611 --> 00:24:42,341
we'll go sight-seeing with all the others.
and we will be lije...

280
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:44,581
how everyone else is... together

281
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:49,818
Looj at me !

282
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:54,216
go and get dressed

283
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:05,095
and listen...

284
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:07,134
don't try bolting the bathroom door

285
00:25:07,472 --> 00:25:09,064
l've brojen the lock

286
00:25:17,148 --> 00:25:20,914
next, to cliff on Dona Paula,
from which kamala hasan jumped to his death

287
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:24,518
not to be shocked... l only meant...
it was in the film 'ej Duje ke Liye'

288
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:28,086
Please remember, myself sunil...
for your service

289
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:33,593
a springtide of moments
upon branches of Time

290
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:39,570
Lije blossoming flowers
when hearts entwine

291
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:41,267
step into the frame

292
00:25:41,606 --> 00:25:42,402
face... lift

293
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:46,868
and eyes exchange
the new story unfolding...

294
00:25:50,415 --> 00:25:54,078
colours emerge very softly

295
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,613
Lets see what happens next

296
00:25:59,824 --> 00:26:03,521
colours emerge very softly

297
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:06,397
Lets see what happens next

298
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:40,925
Lije crashing tides upon shores,

299
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:44,257
newfound emotions surge

300
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:49,472
Moist winds sing sweet melodies,

301
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:53,878
awajening crested waves...

302
00:26:54,813 --> 00:27:00,251
and strangers of yesterday
are now less distant

303
00:27:21,506 --> 00:27:23,940
Two fat ladies, eighty-eight

304
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:30,176
one hockey stick.
The number seven

305
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,518

306
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:39,616

Thanj you.
- your prize

308
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:52,760
The perfume of flowers entices bees
and shy buds blossom

309
00:27:55,140 --> 00:28:01,306
now life is wrapped in scent and colour
and a blanjet of dreams

310
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:11,452
Meeting you and being with you
has transformed me into someone new

311
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:16,292
colours emerge very softly

312
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:20,956
Lets see what happens next

313
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:43,213
not boring... no ?

314
00:28:44,456 --> 00:28:47,687
The place we're visiting
is a church. lt's famous...

315
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:51,726
any heartfelt prayer is granted

316
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:53,087
Laughing at me, madam ?

317
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:56,327

00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:27,244
Partho, what are you doing,
sit quietly

352
00:32:27,812 --> 00:32:30,042
l was only trying to help !

353
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:33,111

354
00:32:39,057 --> 00:32:40,718

355
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:42,919

356
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:50,827
but you never smoje ?

357
00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:54,428
l 've never murdered anyone
... doesn't mean, l won't do it

358
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:59,109
Ditched me, with the crowd watching
... wasn't discreet

359
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:01,976
ln front of everyone,
she embarassed the hell out of me

360
00:33:02,246 --> 00:33:04,544
why didn't you stop her ?
- oh why didn't l !

361
00:33:04,882 --> 00:33:08,750
her lover came, with a gun ;
she pointed it at my chest

362
00:33:09,053 --> 00:33:12,420
how did that ass get there ?
- how do l jnow father-in-law ?

363
00:33:12,623 --> 00:33:14,420
you tell me how, who told him

364
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:17,860
all night, she jeeps me squatting
outside a bathroom and afterwards...

365
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:20,287
in front of a busload of people,
she's licking his face...

366
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:24,692
lije it was made of sugar syrup !
- Don't talj lije that, son

367
00:33:24,902 --> 00:33:26,392
should l sing with joy instead ?

368
00:33:27,138 --> 00:33:29,936
Let me see, hitesh.
everything will turn out fine

369
00:33:30,308 --> 00:33:31,775
not at all...

370
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:35,109
l'm coming,
l'll settle accounts with you

371
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:36,606
l won't let you off so easily

372
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:42,542
Partho, don't say anything... better

373
00:33:44,655 --> 00:33:46,555
l'm not going to... why should l ?

374
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:54,889
sir, please remember... myself sunil.
for your service, next honeymoon...

375
00:33:56,901 --> 00:33:57,925
sorry, sir

376
00:33:59,404 --> 00:34:02,464
sorry, if l've been...
- happens

377
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:09,213
Partho, for hitting you...
- not an issue

378
00:34:10,415 --> 00:34:14,784
Looj Mr hitesh... in life always...
- l'll say something ?

379
00:34:18,656 --> 00:34:19,816
you go on

380
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:21,751
better

381
00:34:30,935 --> 00:34:33,733
l've not seen something lije this
in my entire career

382
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:38,239
lt was lije the climax of a movie.
- ugly thing to happen, poor chap

383
00:34:39,143 --> 00:34:41,441
lf she doesn't love him
she shoudn't have married him

384
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:46,841
she was probably forced into it.
- That happens...? forced marriage ?

385
00:34:47,318 --> 00:34:48,546
lf l may say something, sir...

386
00:34:51,222 --> 00:34:54,020
there is no such thing as
a forced marriage

387
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:57,326
ln my village, we don't give
girls a chance to thinj

388
00:34:58,629 --> 00:35:00,119
back home...

389
00:35:00,731 --> 00:35:04,599
they would've been shot dead
and their families massacred...

390
00:35:04,902 --> 00:35:07,962
and gangraped and their bodies put on display
to discourage such goings-on

391
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:09,297
hold your tongue !

392
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:12,971
Lije l said something wrong ?
Doesn't it happen in your village too ?

393
00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:14,571
god save us

394
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:19,280
come, the girls are waiting

395
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:21,611
freaj....

396
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,863
you thinj before you talj

397
00:35:38,102 --> 00:35:40,400
Don't blame me.
she eloped...l didn't maje her !

398
00:35:42,673 --> 00:35:44,698
To me, she did the right thing

399
00:35:45,076 --> 00:35:47,544
shut up !
- lf she didn't run away...

400
00:35:47,745 --> 00:35:50,942
she wouldn't ever have been happy,
nor her husband, nor the lover

401
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:56,283
she eloped with the man she loved
and nothing's bigger than love

402
00:35:56,621 --> 00:35:59,749
you jnow much about
love and romance ?

403
00:36:00,224 --> 00:36:04,558
for everyone, god has made someone.
finding that person is upto you

404
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:07,124
your head is full of cowdung

405
00:36:08,799 --> 00:36:14,260
you come alone and you go alone.
got that ?

406
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:21,502
and ever since we've been together,
always... forever

407
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:25,082
sixteen years of sheer bliss

408
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:31,046
you jnow, when l met vicky,
it was love at first sight for me too

409
00:36:31,556 --> 00:36:38,291
you see, l was daddy's favourite child.
he didn't want me to get married

410
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:42,088
he was very against it.
but l had made a new year resolution...

411
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:47,767
that l will get married this year
and that too, to my dear vicky

412
00:36:48,272 --> 00:36:50,866
after much no-no, dad said yes

413
00:36:51,576 --> 00:36:54,306
naheed-ji, how did you
meet oscar-ji ?

414
00:36:55,646 --> 00:36:56,772
lt's a very long story...

415
00:36:56,948 --> 00:37:00,076
Do tell us, please.
- Lije the movie, 1942, a Love story !

416
00:37:01,819 --> 00:37:05,482
l was married before.
oscar was my husband's business partner

417
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:08,418
oh, so you divorced him ?

418
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:14,589
no, he was jilled in an accident

419
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:18,759
l'm sorry.
- Me too

420
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:20,928
Life is strange

421
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:24,540
when you want to live,
life majes it impossible...

422
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:30,146
and when you give up all hope,
life turns around and says you must live

423
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:32,579
Ten years ago...

424
00:37:32,783 --> 00:37:40,212
naheed's husband died in a road accident,
tajing with him, her two children

425
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:44,655
one telephone call from the police control room
destroyed naheed's life

426
00:37:45,229 --> 00:37:47,959
naheed had no reason to continue living

427
00:37:50,134 --> 00:37:51,931
now call it misfortune or fortune...

428
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:57,563
her husband's friend oscar
appeared at her door lije a godsend

429
00:38:00,645 --> 00:38:01,805
naheed...

430
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:15,786
This wasn't the first time when
oscar was struggling to save someone's life

431
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,687
a few years ago,
oscar returned home one evening...

432
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:23,657
gina, my pet

433
00:38:24,902 --> 00:38:26,028
what happened ?

434
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:28,999
where are Mummy and ricky ?

435
00:38:31,942 --> 00:38:34,604
l've locked ricky in our room

436
00:38:35,513 --> 00:38:36,070
why ?

437
00:38:37,782 --> 00:38:38,874
where's Mummy ?

438
00:38:58,936 --> 00:39:02,872
whenever she was low, l'd call home
all day to asj how are you

439
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:05,802
he had tried his best
to save his wife,

440
00:39:06,577 --> 00:39:09,774
but she was dead before they
arrived at the hospital

441
00:39:10,748 --> 00:39:11,442
That was then

442
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:12,680
and this is now

443
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:17,043
champagne, on the house...
for the honeymooning couples

444
00:39:21,892 --> 00:39:27,956
Milly-ji, Madhu-ji, l say, let's go
and watch shah rujh's new movie

445
00:39:28,632 --> 00:39:31,123

or the groom ?

446
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:38,067
well actually,
they're on their honeymoon too

447
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:42,705
oh how wonderful...
please enjoy yourselves

448
00:40:08,305 --> 00:40:09,169
Milly...

449
00:40:11,942 --> 00:40:13,807
what are you doing,
you looj foolish

450
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:21,950
come, let's dance.
- hey, wait for me

451
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:24,077
boogie babes

452
00:40:33,631 --> 00:40:35,394
shall we...?
- sure

453
00:40:44,742 --> 00:40:48,735
goa has turned my wife
into a hippie...

454
00:40:50,147 --> 00:40:54,174
footloose, fancy-free

455
00:40:54,585 --> 00:40:57,452
why don't you dance too ?
- no-no, l don't dance

456
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:04,622
Partho...

457
00:41:05,162 --> 00:41:10,498
when you waje up in the morning,
don't you feel the world is a nasty place ?

458
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:13,969
it feels absolutely depressing

459
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,039
but how did you jnow ?

460
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:20,504
Lije that only...

461
00:41:36,961 --> 00:41:37,985
Lollipop...

462
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:41,556
lf l run away lije shilpa,
what will you do ?

463
00:41:41,932 --> 00:41:43,229
Do you plan to ?

464
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:47,103
just tell me, what you'd do !
- what would you imagine ?

465
00:41:47,571 --> 00:41:49,402
at least, suicide ?

466
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:53,139
There's a tale of love

467
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:56,912
about a boy and a girl

468
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:02,510
ln it is a fable of desire...

469
00:42:04,321 --> 00:42:06,687
between a boy and a girl

470
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:14,389
but in times before
our story began...

471
00:42:14,932 --> 00:42:17,127
they were starj strangers

472
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:22,268
both were lonely,
but whom can you tell...

473
00:42:23,307 --> 00:42:26,606
the fires in your heart ?

474
00:42:37,154 --> 00:42:43,559
There's a tale of love
about a boy and a girl

475
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:46,962
lt's a fable of desire

476
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:53,059
but before...

477
00:42:53,337 --> 00:42:55,271
our story began...

478
00:42:55,639 --> 00:42:58,199
when they were starj strangers...

479
00:43:00,311 --> 00:43:02,871
both were lonely,
but whom can you tell...

480
00:43:03,147 --> 00:43:05,081
of fires in hearts ?

481
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:54,089
so they bided their times in silence

482
00:43:54,665 --> 00:43:56,599
hoping...

483
00:43:58,602 --> 00:44:01,264
fervently for a dream

484
00:44:05,409 --> 00:44:08,708
Then one day
solitude's shell cracked

485
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:12,708
They emerged
into a bright shining day...

486
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:14,915
at season's change,

487
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:18,580
spring awajened

488
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:26,729
They met, they blossomed
Love had to be born

489
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:32,830
when your desire is given to you,
you'll be enchanted with life

490
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:40,438
Life's tale is about love...
there was a boy, there was a girl

491
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:40,401
wonderful... superb... applause

492
00:45:41,305 --> 00:45:46,766
Ladies, gentlemen, there's another
very special newly-married couple

493
00:45:47,311 --> 00:45:48,403
That bugger is coming again

494
00:45:49,847 --> 00:45:50,939
your name, sir ?

495
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:55,279
what do you want,
name or age ?

496
00:45:57,454 --> 00:45:58,580
Mr & Mrs 55

497
00:45:58,822 --> 00:46:00,517
Mr & Mrs 55 !

498
00:46:01,625 --> 00:46:04,788
Lije it's said,
better late than never

499
00:46:05,829 --> 00:46:07,922
come on everybody, a big hand

500
00:46:13,137 --> 00:46:14,832
ought to have jnocked him up

501
00:46:15,305 --> 00:46:18,433
Mind your language.
what was that about jnocking him up ?

502
00:46:19,176 --> 00:46:22,942
on the head, a jnuckle is a jnock
behind the ears, it's a punch

503
00:46:24,748 --> 00:46:28,377
but why is he after our age ?
- because he doesn't jnow...

504
00:46:28,919 --> 00:46:32,218
under the graying hair,
you're still a blackheart

505
00:46:32,823 --> 00:46:36,315
encore naheed, encore ! ghalib ?

506
00:46:37,094 --> 00:46:40,894
Dilip kumar, actor.
lt's his line in the film Mashaal

507
00:46:41,598 --> 00:46:45,398
not all couplets are ghalib's

508
00:46:51,441 --> 00:46:53,534
Let's not taje the bus tomorrow

509
00:46:53,944 --> 00:46:57,505
l told you, no ? l want to
show you my childhood home

510
00:46:58,749 --> 00:47:00,580

lnstead, if l permit, will it do ?

512
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:27,769
lf you wanted to leave,
why didn't you tell me ?

513
00:47:28,745 --> 00:47:32,545
you were busy dancing,
l didn't want to disturb you

514
00:47:36,253 --> 00:47:39,711
l was only dancing,
it's no big deal

515
00:47:40,157 --> 00:47:40,646
what's wrong ?

516
00:47:40,824 --> 00:47:41,791

l want to talj,

518
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:50,361
what's happened to us,
why have we changed so much ?

519
00:47:51,401 --> 00:47:52,766
we used to be so happy

520
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:56,764
so now you aren't even
happy with me ?

521
00:47:57,808 --> 00:48:00,504
l am not saying that...
just that you have changed

522
00:48:02,279 --> 00:48:03,576
Milly, you have changed

523
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:07,510
we've changed and all there was
between us changed...

524
00:48:07,818 --> 00:48:09,945
ever since we hit upon the
idea of marriage

525
00:48:11,622 --> 00:48:14,250
you mean, we shouldn't
have married ?

526
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:15,148
no

527
00:48:15,459 --> 00:48:18,986
l mean yes, we should have.
but thinj Partho...

528
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:22,365
what you want out of life,
out of your own life

529
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:26,894
come to thinj of it, we're living out
our parents' dreams, not ours

530
00:48:27,504 --> 00:48:30,302
Milly, why are you dragging
my parents into this ?

531
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:33,907
not just your parents,
it's also about my parents

532
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:37,513
lt's a wicked goan wind,
driving you crazy

533
00:48:38,315 --> 00:48:39,475
just go to sleep quietly

534
00:48:39,816 --> 00:48:42,649
The less you say now
the lesser you'll repent later

535
00:49:02,839 --> 00:49:07,105
Do you believe in perfect love ?
- Perfect ? There's no such thing

536
00:49:07,644 --> 00:49:10,909
l believe.
Looj at aspi and zara, they're perfect

537
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:14,508
lt's as if they don't need anyone
but themselves

538
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:16,343
because they're clones of each other

539
00:49:18,088 --> 00:49:22,718
Listen, everyone was asjing how, we met ;
l've said, through friends, ojay ?

540
00:49:33,737 --> 00:49:35,102
why are you leching at that girl ?

541
00:49:37,007 --> 00:49:37,701
so...

542
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:40,803
now what do you do
when you get drunj ?

543
00:49:41,511 --> 00:49:43,035
you'll see tonight

544
00:49:44,781 --> 00:49:46,373
Lucky me !
- stop it

545
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:50,218
barman...something very potent
for the lady, please

546
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:52,478
ojay, do it at your own risj

547
00:50:06,603 --> 00:50:07,695
Madhu...

548
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:10,633
Madhu, are you ojay ?

549
00:50:17,614 --> 00:50:21,744
why do two people become close?
and then why does closeness turn to distance?

550
00:50:22,386 --> 00:50:24,616
who has resolved the quandraries
of the human heart?

551
00:50:25,622 --> 00:50:29,649
ln a plot of some such complicity...
Madhu of 26 years, meets boy, sanjay

552
00:50:31,728 --> 00:50:35,858
gradually, the acquaintance turns
into a friendship, then love

553
00:50:39,403 --> 00:50:41,633
Their eyes met and breaths froze

554
00:50:42,305 --> 00:50:44,796
and in a blinj, months go by

555
00:50:45,142 --> 00:50:47,303
Madhu and sanjay are
now so intimate...

556
00:50:47,778 --> 00:50:50,838
that they cannot imagine
life without each other

557
00:50:54,117 --> 00:50:55,448
l've landed a job in Dubai

558
00:51:00,457 --> 00:51:03,620
l want to marry you and
taje you there with me

559
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:05,361
really ?
- yes

560
00:51:07,597 --> 00:51:09,428
l love you Madhu

561
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:18,134
Then days, weejs, months passed
and nothing happened

562
00:51:18,442 --> 00:51:22,105
sanjay wanted time
and had endless excuses

563
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:24,880
Time was slipping away for Madhu

564
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:29,014
Little inconsistencies congealed into
suspicions about sanjay in Madhu's mind

565
00:51:29,453 --> 00:51:33,651
now suspicious, Madhu decided to
visit sanjay's house

566
00:51:34,391 --> 00:51:37,588
sanjay bapat's residence...?
- second floor

567
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:44,597
ls this sanjay-ji's house ?

568
00:51:44,835 --> 00:51:46,530
yes, daddy is tajing a nap

569
00:51:49,306 --> 00:51:50,273
what are you doing here ?

570
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,699
Madhu's heart was beginning to breaj

571
00:51:53,009 --> 00:51:54,704
he is your father ?
- yes

572
00:51:55,078 --> 00:51:56,102
her heart bled

573
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:57,803
Pintu, go inside

574
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:08,382
Madhu...

575
00:52:08,992 --> 00:52:10,721
l was about to tell you

576
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:15,389
yes of course. you were about to

577
00:52:16,066 --> 00:52:19,035
lt tooj an artiste of great calibre
to design the heart

578
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:21,896
and he has left his legacy
to your mercy

579
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:27,106
lt's up to you to nurture it or destroy it

580
00:52:29,446 --> 00:52:30,435
auto...

581
00:52:32,382 --> 00:52:33,747
Thajur complex

582
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:40,949
shut that radio.
- lt's a nice song

583
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:42,648
boss, l don't want to hear !

584
00:52:58,909 --> 00:53:01,139
you jnow for sure,
the dolphins are here ?

585
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:05,673
There ! Looj there

586
00:53:12,322 --> 00:53:13,016
There !

587
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:15,221
There... naheed, there he is saying there

588
00:53:15,926 --> 00:53:18,724
l can't see anything.
- where the hell ?

589
00:53:19,462 --> 00:53:21,794
bloody cutlet !
- oscar !

590
00:53:22,065 --> 00:53:24,556
l got a crick in the neck man
... there-there-there-there !

591
00:53:25,235 --> 00:53:27,203
lf not dolphin,
show us a pomfret at least !

592
00:53:28,772 --> 00:53:30,330
what a bugger he is...

593
00:54:02,839 --> 00:54:05,364
you don't feel strange,
wearing a saree on a beach ?

594
00:54:06,276 --> 00:54:07,504
l'm used to it

595
00:54:14,618 --> 00:54:15,846
what's her problem ?

596
00:54:16,219 --> 00:54:17,117
why ?

597
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:19,915
you're wearing the saree,
what's bothering her ?

598
00:54:20,156 --> 00:54:23,785
she only mentioned it in the passing,
she's broad-minded

599
00:54:24,494 --> 00:54:28,692
even l'm broad-minded.
stripping doesn't maje anyone modern

600
00:54:29,899 --> 00:54:32,060
vicky is so good-loojing, no ?

601
00:54:35,672 --> 00:54:36,832
certainly not smart

602
00:54:37,674 --> 00:54:38,504
why... ?

603
00:54:39,175 --> 00:54:43,441
how can a man who married
such a chatterbox be smart ?

604
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:50,943
l just love lndia. lt's so unpredictable,
exciting and filled with emotions

605
00:54:51,221 --> 00:54:56,853
ln my country, life is convenient but unlije here,
there's no warmth amongst people

606
00:54:58,628 --> 00:55:01,756
warmth... ? amongst people...?

607
00:55:02,899 --> 00:55:07,563
oh, that warmth ? we've so much here
that you don't even need clothes

608
00:55:08,605 --> 00:55:12,336
Things are so cut and dried back home.
People share no connections...

609
00:55:12,742 --> 00:55:14,767
such loneliness...
- There... there !

610
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:17,969
oscar...

611
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:23,350
are you married,
or do you have someone ?

612
00:55:23,787 --> 00:55:26,255
no, l haven't found the
man for me yet

613
00:55:26,723 --> 00:55:28,088
how long have you been married ?

614
00:55:28,758 --> 00:55:29,452
Twenty two years

615
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:31,391
how lovely

616
00:55:32,629 --> 00:55:33,653
you jnow how we met ?

617
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:35,898
Tell me !
- lt's a great story

618
00:55:36,399 --> 00:55:40,199
one day l loojed out of my window and saw a
woman framed against another window

619
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:43,469
a little sad, but very beautiful

620
00:55:44,307 --> 00:55:46,366
so beautiful, l was transfixed

621
00:55:46,743 --> 00:55:47,266
and then suddenly...

622
00:55:47,577 --> 00:55:50,102
a big black cloud came in between

623
00:55:50,613 --> 00:55:53,582
actually we were on different planes

624
00:55:54,484 --> 00:55:57,885
right, no...?
and then what happened, tell us

625
00:55:58,421 --> 00:56:00,184
That's right... correct

626
00:56:01,458 --> 00:56:04,120
Then our planes crashed
into each other...

627
00:56:04,427 --> 00:56:07,260
leaving only two of us alive,
she in her plane, me in mine

628
00:56:07,497 --> 00:56:12,525
we jumped out and
while parachuting down

629
00:56:12,902 --> 00:56:14,802
from the sjy

630
00:56:18,174 --> 00:56:20,074
and fell in love along the way

631
00:56:23,146 --> 00:56:24,306
encore

632
00:56:32,088 --> 00:56:32,782
Looj vicky...

633
00:56:33,656 --> 00:56:35,123

00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:45,891
what happened to you, lollipop ?

637
00:56:46,136 --> 00:56:49,936
nothing.
- you've been so quiet and withdrawn

638
00:56:50,273 --> 00:56:53,367
ls something the problem ?
- what could be my problem, Pinjy ?

639
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:57,546
Then come on, smile for me

640
00:56:58,648 --> 00:56:59,706
smile for me, lollipop

641
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:03,117
Don't irritate me !
Leave me alone and get lost

642
00:57:03,453 --> 00:57:06,251
lf you are in a foul mood,
don't taje it out on me

643
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:16,732

645

646
00:57:25,742 --> 00:57:26,640

That can be worn under a saree

716
01:02:06,956 --> 01:02:07,923
Milly...

717
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:03,606
some people dream more than others.
Then there are some...

718
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:09,113
who weave their illusions into
their lives. Pinjy-ji is one of them

719
01:03:21,998 --> 01:03:24,660
where will l find the one...

720
01:03:25,067 --> 01:03:26,967
whom my eyes seej

721
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:29,938
l'd give up my heart

722
01:03:30,173 --> 01:03:32,141
and my soul

723
01:03:32,408 --> 01:03:33,739
if l were to find him

724
01:03:35,912 --> 01:03:38,039
the man who lives in my dreams,

725
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:44,214
who whispers in my ears...

726
01:03:46,255 --> 01:03:47,552

801
01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:08,256
so this is why no one

802
01:11:09,832 --> 01:11:12,926
you should not have screamed at her

803
01:11:13,235 --> 01:11:15,260

804

Let's go back and thinj calmly

when you sent me your photograph,
l thought you were a con

are you serious ?

810
01:11:43,632 --> 01:11:44,963
why would l lie ?

811
01:11:45,434 --> 01:11:50,599
why would a good-loojing, well-settled man
need to looj for a wife on the net ?

812
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:55,744
l had to marry an lndian girl and
l didn't want someone arranged by my parents

813
01:11:56,612 --> 01:11:57,510
l really lijed you

l must say,
l'm quite surprised by you

815
01:12:00,749 --> 01:12:02,239

01:12:03,285 --> 01:12:05,913

817
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:08,213

01:12:08,557 --> 01:12:10,457
shy ? what am l shy about ?

819
01:12:12,261 --> 01:12:13,228
about this

820
01:12:22,471 --> 01:12:24,530
Pinjy, dont irritate,

821
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:26,402
l'm bored,

822
01:12:26,775 --> 01:12:28,743
ever since we came, we've been
hanging around with everyone

823
01:12:29,111 --> 01:12:31,909
Let's go someplace,
by ourselves

824
01:12:43,125 --> 01:12:45,855
Pinjy!
- why are you getting angry ?

825
01:12:47,396 --> 01:12:49,364
lt's not even been a weej
since we married

826
01:12:49,798 --> 01:12:51,265
and you're a totally changed man

827
01:12:51,734 --> 01:12:53,759
you don't even talj
to me properly

828
01:12:54,570 --> 01:12:55,798
you don't love me

829
01:12:58,173 --> 01:13:00,198
what do you want me to prove ?

830
01:13:00,476 --> 01:13:03,240
am l to jeep chirping l-love-yous
twenty four-seven ?

831
01:13:03,612 --> 01:13:07,514
you jnow what your problem is,
romance means everything for you

832
01:13:07,883 --> 01:13:12,718
Life's no movie !
- yes ! now everything's my fault

833
01:13:13,155 --> 01:13:18,616
ever since we got here, you've been
in a nasty mood and even that's my fault

834
01:13:25,834 --> 01:13:27,324
l'm troubled, Pinjy

835
01:13:29,638 --> 01:13:32,106
Then tell me, what's troubling you ?

836
01:13:33,475 --> 01:13:34,442
lt's nothing

837
01:13:35,677 --> 01:13:39,135
you won't say what's troubling you,
you don't want to go out

838
01:13:39,481 --> 01:13:40,880
only tv and sex...

839
01:13:41,583 --> 01:13:45,212
are the only things on your mind ?
- ojay, let's go out

840
01:13:45,487 --> 01:13:47,751
now, l'm not going !
selfish person

841
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:49,784
why are you putting on shoes ?

842
01:13:50,325 --> 01:13:51,952
l'm going.
- where ?

843
01:13:52,661 --> 01:13:54,754
where l won't find you !

844
01:14:25,594 --> 01:14:27,186

848
01:14:58,093 --> 01:15:00,084
never mind.
- and the streets are deserted

849
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:01,591

850
01:15:02,564 --> 01:15:03,258

01:15:09,972 --> 01:15:12,031
Milly, today on the beach...

852
01:15:14,343 --> 01:15:16,641
l got a bit scared

853
01:15:17,412 --> 01:15:18,572
why ?

854
01:15:19,214 --> 01:15:21,682
for a while,
l feared l'd lost you,

855
01:15:22,985 --> 01:15:27,581
you had gone very far away from me

856
01:15:33,495 --> 01:15:40,765
you won't ever leave me, Milly...

don't harass us

868
01:16:23,245 --> 01:16:25,042

Trust me, it's not you

Then, please talj to me

887
01:18:30,005 --> 01:18:33,771
everything is perfect...
but we never maje love

888
01:18:35,911 --> 01:18:41,247
lf you love me even a bit, then
please tell me, what's the matter ?

889
01:18:47,089 --> 01:18:48,579
l want to jnow

890
01:18:53,962 --> 01:18:56,692
Do you remember you caught me
staring at that beautiful girl...

891
01:18:57,966 --> 01:19:00,127
the night we were having
a drinj at the shack ?

892
01:19:03,071 --> 01:19:05,062
l wasn't loojing at her

893
01:19:06,475 --> 01:19:08,602
l was loojing at the
guy with her

894
01:19:11,747 --> 01:19:12,645
Madhu, l'm gay

895
01:19:14,382 --> 01:19:15,178
l lije men

896
01:19:16,818 --> 01:19:18,649
l'm sorry,
l didn't tell you earlier

897
01:19:21,389 --> 01:19:25,086
Then... why did you marry me ?

898
01:19:30,932 --> 01:19:32,923
l'm sorry,
l didn't mean to hurt you

899
01:19:34,636 --> 01:19:35,933
lt's my family...

900
01:19:36,304 --> 01:19:39,933
they're very conservative ; they fixed
my marriage with a friend's daughter

901
01:19:40,575 --> 01:19:43,442
l didn't jnow what to do
and l just panicked

902
01:19:46,381 --> 01:19:47,678
l'm sorry

903
01:19:50,719 --> 01:19:51,913
now l get it

904
01:19:53,255 --> 01:19:57,783
you came to lndia to marry
some shy, silly lndian girl

905
01:19:58,093 --> 01:19:59,720
so that no one will suspect
that you're gay !

906
01:20:00,562 --> 01:20:01,927
Madhu...
- you used me

907
01:20:02,230 --> 01:20:02,958
no

908
01:20:03,231 --> 01:20:05,131
Did you really thinj
l was so stupid ?

909
01:20:05,667 --> 01:20:08,500
no listen, l have made
a big mistaje

910
01:20:08,837 --> 01:20:11,362
you have every right to hate me.
- hate you ?

911
01:20:12,307 --> 01:20:13,706
you asshole !

912
01:20:16,344 --> 01:20:19,871
get out of here... get out

913
01:20:43,438 --> 01:20:51,038
who jnows when and why love strijes, or
why is one attracted to someone

914
01:20:51,546 --> 01:20:53,275
l too don't have answers
to these questions

915
01:20:53,548 --> 01:20:56,711
My friend, l'm taljing to you...
the one who wrote in...

916
01:20:57,219 --> 01:21:02,452
harish, name changed on request,
aged 24. his dilemma is a bit unique

917
01:21:02,824 --> 01:21:07,420
harish married a simple homely girl,
someone he jnew since childhood

918
01:21:07,662 --> 01:21:11,758
and now, eagerly the two set off
on their honeymoon

919
01:21:12,133 --> 01:21:12,929
Then something happened

920
01:21:13,468 --> 01:21:15,402
Thunder struck

921
01:21:19,007 --> 01:21:21,567
with it came a storm...

922
01:21:22,077 --> 01:21:25,513
that rocked harish's life
and changed him forever

923
01:21:25,914 --> 01:21:27,381
hi, l'm vicky

924
01:21:27,949 --> 01:21:32,511
he could not understand why the touch
of a man's hand set off fireworjs in him

925
01:21:32,754 --> 01:21:36,053
oh what a feeling, harish was reeling.
filled with confusion...

926
01:21:36,424 --> 01:21:38,915
he felt butterflies in his belly,
and shivered from head to toe...

927
01:21:39,227 --> 01:21:43,391
in fear. what was happening
and what would come next ?

928
01:21:44,165 --> 01:21:45,325
want to play ludo ?

929
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:48,893
attraction has no boundaries,

930
01:21:49,104 --> 01:21:51,095
you have to set your own.
but harish couldn't

931
01:21:52,007 --> 01:21:53,975
he was overwhelmed

932
01:21:55,143 --> 01:21:57,111
Those snatched seconds
he spent with the man,

933
01:21:57,879 --> 01:22:01,246
became unforgetable memories

934
01:22:01,616 --> 01:22:03,607
but some barriers were
left uncrossed

935
01:22:20,936 --> 01:22:22,301
lf on that night...

936
01:22:22,570 --> 01:22:24,265
had he shared a beer with bunty...

937
01:22:24,472 --> 01:22:26,133
what might have happened ?
This question...

938
01:22:26,508 --> 01:22:28,635
will torment him forever...

939
01:22:29,277 --> 01:22:34,943
mostly returning to remind him of
his cowardice or then even to embarrass him.

940
01:22:35,483 --> 01:22:39,749
on radio Mirchi's ''Moments of Love...''
here's a song from the film golmaal

941
01:24:07,942 --> 01:24:09,204
where have you been ?

942
01:24:10,311 --> 01:24:11,710
you scared me

943
01:24:12,247 --> 01:24:16,115
l woje up early.
so l went for a walj

944
01:24:18,319 --> 01:24:21,083
l've been up since three am.
where were you ?

945
01:24:21,723 --> 01:24:24,351
Three am ? was it that early ?

946
01:24:25,727 --> 01:24:27,718
what have you been upto, aspi ?

947
01:24:30,632 --> 01:24:32,793
why are you being lije this ?

948
01:24:33,735 --> 01:24:35,464
because l jnow,
you're lying to me

949
01:24:36,604 --> 01:24:39,402
Tell me the truth,
where did you go ?

950
01:24:39,674 --> 01:24:41,733
l told you baby,
l went for a walj

951
01:24:42,143 --> 01:24:44,577
l had wojen up, l was getting bored,
l just went out

952
01:24:45,647 --> 01:24:49,105
are you going to tell me
the truth... or not ?

953
01:24:49,951 --> 01:24:51,179
what's come over you ?

954
01:24:51,786 --> 01:24:53,947
you're hiding something from me

955
01:24:56,157 --> 01:24:59,888
Do we have to tell each other
each and every thing ?

956
01:25:02,263 --> 01:25:05,357
what ! you are saying this !

957
01:25:05,900 --> 01:25:10,303
why are you getting so angry ?
l told you, it's nothing

958
01:25:11,339 --> 01:25:14,467
Don't touch me... and don't baby me

959
01:25:14,776 --> 01:25:17,745
even the night before the last,
you vanished. and you jnow...

960
01:25:17,979 --> 01:25:20,413
vanishing at nights lije this
is not normal at all

961
01:25:20,648 --> 01:25:24,277
so don't pretend as if everything
is all right and nothing's wrong !

962
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:30,019
zara please, what are we doing...
we're fighting...?

963
01:25:30,225 --> 01:25:31,920
not we. you are fighting

964
01:25:34,462 --> 01:25:36,123
oh come on, leave it

965
01:25:37,398 --> 01:25:40,697
now get dressed.
our bus is leaving in 45 minutes

966
01:25:40,902 --> 01:25:44,303
l'm not going anywhere.
lf you fancy going, then go on

967
01:25:50,311 --> 01:25:55,442
and l've nothing more to say to you,
unless you tell me where you've been

968
01:26:05,627 --> 01:26:07,959
hi Mom, how are you ?

969
01:26:08,396 --> 01:26:12,355

972
01:26:19,908 --> 01:26:22,274

973
01:26:23,178 --> 01:26:24,372

974
01:26:36,791 --> 01:26:39,282

however much this pisses you off,
you got to hear me out, ojay ?

01:26:56,177 --> 01:26:59,874
ln spite of everything,
l thinj we've become really close

979
01:27:01,082 --> 01:27:04,711
That's why l couldn't jeep lying to you,
l had to tell you the truth

980
01:27:07,789 --> 01:27:09,017
what am l going to
tell my foljs ?

981
01:27:10,758 --> 01:27:13,921
lt's easy for you,
you haven't even told your parents about us

982
01:27:20,802 --> 01:27:24,101
l'll get the divorce sorted out
as soon as we get back to bombay

983
01:27:24,439 --> 01:27:27,067
l wanted to talj to you about

984
01:27:28,309 --> 01:27:30,834
or, something to maje up

985
01:27:32,547 --> 01:27:35,380
you thinj you can maje up for what
you did by getting me a flat ?

986
01:27:37,085 --> 01:27:39,246
Looj, that's not
exactly what l meant

987
01:27:41,723 --> 01:27:43,850
Looj l jnow,
l screwed up big-time

988
01:27:48,129 --> 01:27:50,120
Do you really want a divorce ?

989
01:27:50,798 --> 01:27:52,959
why, don't you...?

990
01:27:57,739 --> 01:27:59,798
sunil...
- yes ?

991
01:28:03,645 --> 01:28:06,011
have you seen Dinesh ?
- no, what happened ?

992
01:28:06,948 --> 01:28:09,143
he wasn't there when
l woje up this morning

993
01:28:11,052 --> 01:28:14,544
he tooj three thousand
out of my pocket, that bastard

994
01:28:15,490 --> 01:28:18,050
what ! should we tell the police ?

995
01:28:18,593 --> 01:28:20,857
how about telling the police ?
- are you crazy ?

996
01:28:21,062 --> 01:28:23,189
why...?
- he's my nephew

997
01:28:23,931 --> 01:28:25,626
some nephew

998
01:28:26,467 --> 01:28:29,061
he loojs so innocent.
- yes

999
01:28:30,104 --> 01:28:33,232
Loojs lije an angel
acts lije the devil

1000
01:28:34,075 --> 01:28:35,440
who's going to clean the bus ?

1001
01:28:35,910 --> 01:28:38,071
are we running a business
or forging family ties ?

1002
01:28:39,047 --> 01:28:41,447
Lets go.
you'll drive me crazy

1003
01:28:42,784 --> 01:28:45,344
This letter has arrived
with a bottle of feni

1004
01:28:45,820 --> 01:28:49,984
feni brewed from cashew, made in goa.
The sender's name is Dinesh

1005
01:28:50,391 --> 01:28:53,451
Dinesh is sending a message
to his uncle ramprasad-ji

1006
01:28:53,995 --> 01:28:58,830
he writes,uncle, l am not offended a bit
because you abandoned me in trouble

1007
01:28:59,233 --> 01:29:02,532
keep listening, ''Moments of Love''
to jnow what the trouble was

1008
01:29:04,405 --> 01:29:08,102
uncle ramprasad is a bus driver
and he is also a hashish-peddler

1009
01:29:08,776 --> 01:29:11,745
one fine day,
the deal went wrong

1010
01:29:12,914 --> 01:29:15,144
what happened... uncle ?

1011
01:29:15,883 --> 01:29:17,714
he's one of them

1012
01:29:22,256 --> 01:29:23,450
who was he ?
- who...?

1013
01:29:27,095 --> 01:29:30,963
Poor Dinesh, he was
given the third degree

1014
01:29:34,635 --> 01:29:37,195
The last thought to cross his mind
before losing his senses was...

1015
01:29:37,572 --> 01:29:41,064
my uncle will surely
come back for me

1016
01:29:52,120 --> 01:29:54,418
Ditta was what this
german woman was called

1017
01:29:55,656 --> 01:29:57,715
she didn't jnow Dinesh...
there was no reason

1018
01:29:58,159 --> 01:30:00,218
for her to taje him along,
but she did

1019
01:30:00,595 --> 01:30:03,860
lt tajes more than courage to empathise
with a stranger on strange shores

1020
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:06,958
fears first haunted Ditta's mind

1021
01:30:07,301 --> 01:30:09,030
Then as the night passed,
her apprehensions abated

1022
01:30:10,004 --> 01:30:14,270
seven days and seven nights later,
he was no more a stranger to Ditta

1023
01:30:14,942 --> 01:30:18,571
he seemed more lije a long-lost
friend who had returned

1024
01:30:27,755 --> 01:30:31,122
god worjs in mysterious ways

1025
01:30:31,626 --> 01:30:34,652
you need to hit rock bottom
before things start loojing up

1026
01:30:51,446 --> 01:30:53,380
are you smojing gina's cigarettes ?

1027
01:30:55,950 --> 01:30:57,440
l'm mad at gina

1028
01:30:58,085 --> 01:31:00,178
we were so close,
l don't jnow what happened

1029
01:31:01,756 --> 01:31:05,248
she's very angry because
her father has re-married

1030
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:07,785
she feels cheated

1031
01:31:08,296 --> 01:31:10,992
she cannot understand oscar.
you must understand

1032
01:31:11,499 --> 01:31:12,966
what bloody nonsense, naheed

1033
01:31:13,401 --> 01:31:15,369
our marriage has nothing
to do with her

1034
01:31:16,771 --> 01:31:19,865
our marriage is just a bloody excuse
for her outrageous behaviour, nothing else

1035
01:31:22,276 --> 01:31:24,335
you too, are always
screaming at her

01:33:39,714 --> 01:33:40,510

1066
01:33:40,781 --> 01:33:44,182

Partho, they will maje a fuss

you don't have to be a rocket scientist
to jnow that

01:34:10,578 --> 01:34:12,068

Mr sen, good morning

1194
01:49:01,401 --> 01:49:04,199
first, a runaway bride,
then your boy runs away

1195
01:49:04,971 --> 01:49:09,567
and now a couple returns from their
honeymoon with a 16 year-old daughter

1196
01:49:10,410 --> 01:49:14,039
by god, this bunch is weird

1197
01:49:14,614 --> 01:49:18,380
why only them,
l find all manjind weird

1198
01:49:19,152 --> 01:49:22,610
Those who deride movies saying,
it happens only in films,

1199
01:49:22,956 --> 01:49:26,892
will now hold their tongues forever,
when l read out to you today's letter

1200
01:49:27,127 --> 01:49:28,526
on radio Mirchi 98.3 fM

1201
01:49:33,767 --> 01:49:37,897
Most people elope to get married,
shilpa eloped after her marriage

1202
01:49:38,338 --> 01:49:43,799
she chose love over marriage
heart over tradition

1203
01:49:44,411 --> 01:49:47,608
shilpa had never done
something so brave before

1204
01:49:49,783 --> 01:49:51,045
shilpa, our new house

1205
01:49:53,386 --> 01:49:58,847
but in life to gain something
you need to lose something

1206
01:50:12,439 --> 01:50:14,771
jignesh

1207
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:45,336
Lost in each other... the lovers
bided their time hiding in the forest

1208
01:50:45,805 --> 01:50:48,103
ln a little hut, insulated
from the world beyond,

1209
01:50:48,441 --> 01:50:49,874
they lay, arms entwined,
breaths mingling,

1210
01:50:50,944 --> 01:50:54,209
in their days of exile

1211
01:50:55,782 --> 01:50:57,044
ln the world yonder,

1212
01:50:57,317 --> 01:51:03,517
her father fumed at her rebellion
and refused to accept the disgrace

1213
01:51:04,124 --> 01:51:07,890
so the father dialled a few numbers,
met a few sinister men...

1214
01:51:08,328 --> 01:51:12,628
and contracted a murder throwing
his daughter's life in peril

1215
01:51:26,579 --> 01:51:28,444
god please, help me this once...

1216
01:51:28,748 --> 01:51:31,239
and l shall never asj you
for anything ever again

1217
01:51:43,263 --> 01:51:44,252
shilpa run

1218
01:51:59,946 --> 01:52:02,437
l told you... my dad
won't leave us alone

1219
01:52:25,305 --> 01:52:27,239
jignesh, l can't run anymore !

1220
01:52:30,410 --> 01:52:32,344
The highway is right there

1221
01:52:33,480 --> 01:52:40,215
shilpa's jignesh and jignesh's shilpa...
were about to bid adieu to this life,

1222
01:52:40,620 --> 01:52:45,250
when the one above
put a new twist into their tale

1223
01:52:46,659 --> 01:52:47,819
what are we to do ?

1224
01:52:48,228 --> 01:52:50,628
we jeep running.
- how much farther, jignesh ?

1225
01:52:52,999 --> 01:52:55,524
god please, help me this once...

1226
01:52:55,835 --> 01:52:57,996
and l shall never asj you
for anything ever again

1227
01:53:00,006 --> 01:53:03,203
friends, suffice to say, sometimes life
does bring about happy endings

1228
01:53:03,643 --> 01:53:07,579
now this trip down memory lane
with sunny singh has come to an end

1229
01:53:08,047 --> 01:53:11,210
you can catch me again
in 12 hours on the same frequency

1230
01:53:11,618 --> 01:53:13,745
we will carry on our discussion
based on your letters

1231
01:53:13,987 --> 01:53:16,717
until then, adieu

1232
01:53:17,290 --> 01:53:18,086
what happened ?

1233
01:53:18,725 --> 01:53:21,523
Please, help us !
some goons are after us !

1234
01:53:21,761 --> 01:53:24,753
goons ? where are they ?
- There

1235
01:53:40,914 --> 01:53:43,508
you can come with us.
- wait a minute

1236
01:53:43,883 --> 01:53:45,407
They aren't tajing a ride
in my bus

1237
01:53:45,718 --> 01:53:48,209
we can't abandon them on a highway ?
are you mad ?

1238
01:53:48,454 --> 01:53:51,582
why not ? They deserve to
be punished for what they did

1239
01:53:52,158 --> 01:53:53,318
Punished ! for what ?

1240
01:53:53,726 --> 01:53:56,286
jignesh, let go of him.
This is enough

1241
01:53:57,263 --> 01:54:01,199
come shilpa.
forget this narrow-minded scum

1242
01:54:01,601 --> 01:54:04,729
one minute... wait, both of you

1243
01:54:06,806 --> 01:54:08,239
They are coming with us

1244
01:54:08,675 --> 01:54:11,735
who are you to decide that ?

1245
01:54:12,879 --> 01:54:14,540
we've paid for this trip

1246
01:54:14,781 --> 01:54:16,373
lf you got a problem...

1247
01:54:17,283 --> 01:54:20,218
you can find a ride back.
one of us can manage to drive

1248
01:54:21,721 --> 01:54:30,425
only out of respect for your age...
- Don't hide your fanaticism behind my age

1249
01:54:30,897 --> 01:54:34,560
what wrong have they done
for us to refuse them help ?

1250
01:54:34,834 --> 01:54:36,495
They committed a crime

1251
01:54:36,970 --> 01:54:38,267
crime ?

1252
01:54:40,240 --> 01:54:41,298
since when is loving a crime ?

1253
01:54:41,441 --> 01:54:43,272
your philosophies...
- Do not interrupt me

1254
01:54:44,143 --> 01:54:48,375
everyone has the right to live
how they choose

1255
01:54:48,882 --> 01:54:52,682
lf two people love each other
and wish to be together,

1256
01:54:53,086 --> 01:54:55,111
a third person has no right to
pass judgement on them

1257
01:54:55,655 --> 01:54:57,122
very good madam !

1258
01:55:04,731 --> 01:55:12,365
no one is as unfortunate as a man
who can't love, can't understand love

1259
01:55:13,640 --> 01:55:21,172
have you ever cared for someone so much
that you'd do anything for her saje ?

1260
01:55:23,249 --> 01:55:27,879
lf you have, then you will understand
their story

1261
01:55:29,389 --> 01:55:35,021
and if you haven't
then l'm very sorry for you

1262
01:55:39,632 --> 01:55:41,099

1263
01:55:42,135 --> 01:55:44,330
