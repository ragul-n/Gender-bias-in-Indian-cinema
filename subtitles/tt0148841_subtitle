1
00:02:57,649 --> 00:02:59,116
Please save...

2
00:03:05,957 --> 00:03:06,582
Sir, Chameli!

3
00:03:06,992 --> 00:03:09,222
What happened to Chameli?
-Tiger took Chameli & ran away

4
00:03:09,294 --> 00:03:10,556
Where?
- That side

5
00:04:37,149 --> 00:04:39,014
Did you kill the tiger? - Yes
It is lying that side.

6
00:04:39,084 --> 00:04:40,517
Go and bring it.

7
00:04:43,421 --> 00:04:44,115
Take this.

8
00:05:09,181 --> 00:05:11,877
John, keep the revolver and other
things in my jeep.

9
00:05:16,922 --> 00:05:19,220
Where is Veera?
- In your room, boss

10
00:05:25,096 --> 00:05:26,620
What are you doing here?
- Cleaning, boss

11
00:05:28,066 --> 00:05:29,055
Sit down, Ajay...

12
00:05:31,236 --> 00:05:34,637
I think that we should start
cutting wood from the other...

13
00:05:34,873 --> 00:05:36,431
...side of the forest too
-Why?

14
00:05:37,008 --> 00:05:38,305
The danger of wild animals
won't be there then.

15
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:42,569
Are only the men in danger from
wild animals. What about animals?

16
00:05:49,621 --> 00:05:53,250
Maybe you are right.
-I think that it will be...

17
00:05:53,325 --> 00:05:56,419
...better not to touch that
part of the jungle.

18
00:05:57,229 --> 00:05:58,457
We also get good income
by our hunting at that part.

19
00:05:59,064 --> 00:06:03,524
That is also right. - You will be
surprised to know that...

20
00:06:04,236 --> 00:06:08,935
...I have made my will today
-Will and at this age?

21
00:06:09,374 --> 00:06:13,276
There is no guarantee of life
amongst these wild animals.

22
00:06:14,512 --> 00:06:18,380
You know that I used to live in
Africa before coming to lndia.

23
00:06:19,117 --> 00:06:22,951
My aunt lives there, Mrs. Seeta
Mathur. She will become the...

24
00:06:23,021 --> 00:06:25,182
...owner of Timli Forest Estate
after me.

25
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,524
You have made an old woman
as your heir.

26
00:06:28,093 --> 00:06:33,963
She loves me a lot. I have no
other relations except her.

27
00:06:35,367 --> 00:06:40,361
According to the will, you will
always be the Estate Manager.

28
00:06:40,872 --> 00:06:42,100
Why are you talking
like this today?

29
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,013
Ok, Naresh, we will meet
tomorrow

30
00:06:51,216 --> 00:06:56,483
Boss, am I relieved now.
- Yes - I also thought so.

31
00:06:57,255 --> 00:07:01,817
What do you mean? -lt is five
and I will get the city bus.

32
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:05,787
Are you coming, Neena?- No,
I've to get some papers signed

33
00:07:06,364 --> 00:07:07,524
I will leave by the 6 O'clock
bus.

34
00:07:21,346 --> 00:07:24,247
Greetings, Madam, do you need
anything - Nothing, do your work

35
00:10:37,342 --> 00:10:42,507
No! - Don't be scared, I will
just call the doctor.

36
00:11:10,508 --> 00:11:15,104
Sir...-Teju, one girl is lying
unconscious in my room.

37
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,875
Till I come back, you take care
of her.

38
00:11:20,885 --> 00:11:27,188
A girl in his room and
unconscious at midnight.

39
00:13:48,599 --> 00:13:53,935
There are one lady's footsteps
and a man's footsteps.

40
00:13:55,573 --> 00:14:01,170
The lady must be fashionable
who wore high-heeled shoes.

41
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,511
The marks are going outside,
that means they have...

42
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:10,611
...not come inside this way...
-Take the photo...

43
00:14:16,828 --> 00:14:20,025
The bullet has struck here
and then come out

44
00:14:20,832 --> 00:14:25,428
Are you sure the pistol you saw
yesterday night was Naresh's?

45
00:14:26,137 --> 00:14:30,267
I felt like that only. It was.32
model & Naresh had two like that

46
00:14:31,542 --> 00:14:34,340
Sir, I searched the whole house
& there is no pistol at all

47
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:49,319
Both the pistols have vanished
& bullet is also.32... A rose...

48
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:55,124
Was their statement correct?
-Yes sir, the tribals confirmed..

49
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,929
...that they were in that
celebration yesterday evening.

50
00:14:58,503 --> 00:15:01,495
They were drinking the whole
night - Put bucket full of water

51
00:15:03,508 --> 00:15:07,968
Sir, I got this hankie from
under the jeep's tyres.

52
00:15:09,981 --> 00:15:17,911
Ladies' hankie and fancy ones.
Can you recogniZe this? -No

53
00:15:22,894 --> 00:15:26,330
I forgot in this commotion,
lnspector. Yesterday night...

54
00:15:26,397 --> 00:15:28,228
...when it was raining, a jeep
went by very fast this side...

55
00:15:28,299 --> 00:15:31,029
...and overturned near my house.
There was a girl in that jeep.

56
00:15:31,502 --> 00:15:34,096
Girl! - Yes, that girl fainted
after the accident.

57
00:15:35,173 --> 00:15:37,334
She is in my house. I was going
to fetch the doctor when...

58
00:15:37,408 --> 00:15:40,206
...I saw Naresh's jeep outside
and the bridge was broken.

59
00:15:40,578 --> 00:15:42,603
When I came inside and saw,
I saw fresh blood in Naresh's...

60
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:45,645
...body. -ls that girl still there?
-Yes

61
00:15:57,662 --> 00:16:01,393
What happened? -The jeep
has vanished - What?

62
00:16:02,099 --> 00:16:04,192
The accident occurred here.
-Here...

63
00:16:07,305 --> 00:16:09,000
The accident must have occurred
somewhere else

64
00:16:09,841 --> 00:16:12,366
I saw with my own eyes that the
jeep crashed here and overturned.

65
00:16:14,245 --> 00:16:16,805
It had crashed after midnight and
vanished in the morning.

66
00:16:17,381 --> 00:16:19,008
Somebody has surely taken
the jeep from here at night.

67
00:16:19,584 --> 00:16:23,076
It was a jeep and not a doll.
If the accident had occurred...

68
00:16:23,154 --> 00:16:24,314
...here, some marks should
be here.

69
00:16:26,624 --> 00:16:28,956
But the girl who had that
accident is in my house.

70
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:29,889
Come, you can meet her.

71
00:16:47,144 --> 00:16:48,611
That girl has also vanished.

72
00:16:57,922 --> 00:17:02,484
Teju, where has he gone.

73
00:17:04,795 --> 00:17:08,526
I am not out of my senses. I had
put her on this bed myself.

74
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:15,334
Just at this same place - lt
happens, you were awake the...

75
00:17:15,406 --> 00:17:17,431
...whole night. Now take
a little rest.

76
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:24,009
And if you bring any other
evidence for murder, it should...

77
00:17:24,081 --> 00:17:27,949
...not be imaginative - It will
be strong evidence, lnspector.

78
00:17:34,191 --> 00:17:35,453
Cigar's ashes...

79
00:17:50,107 --> 00:17:51,506
Stop...
Where are you running?

80
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,516
He stole all the fruits. He should
be hit by the trunk he stole...

81
00:17:59,584 --> 00:18:03,020
...Iike the washerman washes
clothes. I've worked there too

82
00:18:03,554 --> 00:18:06,455
Tej Bahadur, take your milk.

83
00:18:12,797 --> 00:18:19,396
Oh God! -What happened to you?
-Today I am not well.

84
00:18:20,237 --> 00:18:24,173
Then ask me for treatment. I've
worked for a compounder too

85
00:18:24,542 --> 00:18:28,137
What is the problem? - I don't
get sleep the whole night.

86
00:18:28,546 --> 00:18:39,252
But why? You get headache,
stomach ache...-No aches..

87
00:18:40,858 --> 00:18:43,884
My body is restless and l
don't get sleep.

88
00:18:44,462 --> 00:18:48,865
This seems like a new disease.
I will just think deeply.

89
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:53,268
What is there to think? Just
give me some treatment.

90
00:18:55,039 --> 00:19:01,911
First tell me how you sleep, on
the back or front? -How?

91
00:19:09,987 --> 00:19:12,888
Like this...
-Lie properly.

92
00:19:13,557 --> 00:19:17,493
Is this right?-Yes, but what is
the use if you don't get sleep.

93
00:19:19,563 --> 00:19:23,329
How is this? -Not correct
-Then how should I lie?

94
00:19:24,168 --> 00:19:29,470
Turn this side.- I don't
understand, you only do it

95
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:34,239
Fool, you roam with such a big
pot of milk on your head but...

96
00:19:34,311 --> 00:19:35,471
...can't you turn while lying
down. Move a little.

97
00:19:38,883 --> 00:19:40,111
See properly with attention.

98
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:59,296
What is this?-I was teaching
Mowa how to sleep nicely.

99
00:20:00,071 --> 00:20:02,596
I feel like putting you to sleep
permanently.

100
00:20:03,207 --> 00:20:05,232
How did this girl vanish from
the house?

101
00:20:05,843 --> 00:20:11,145
Did'nt you see how she went?
- Fool, not Mowa. I am asking...

102
00:20:11,215 --> 00:20:13,843
...about the girl last night.
-I don't know.

103
00:20:14,085 --> 00:20:16,019
Why not? Did'nt I tell you
to watch over her.

104
00:20:16,087 --> 00:20:19,648
I was watching with both the
eyes but her saree was...

105
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:21,482
...exposing her legs while she
turned and I felt...

106
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:27,930
So you came outside and slept
off- I made a mistake.

107
00:20:28,432 --> 00:20:32,266
I have done lots of work but
have never been a watchman.

108
00:20:32,503 --> 00:20:34,232
Do I have to fulfil that
lacking of yours now?

109
00:20:52,156 --> 00:20:55,990
Then you take 31 0 rupees.
-Excuse me

110
00:20:56,060 --> 00:21:01,327
You come and you go...Will you
come tomorrow? - Yes.

111
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:06,827
It is two weeks and till now
Naresh's murderer is not found

112
00:21:07,438 --> 00:21:16,039
Police always delay arresting.
After that he gets hanged fast.

113
00:21:16,914 --> 00:21:17,903
Please sit.

114
00:21:23,954 --> 00:21:28,152
Today Ranbirsingh and his
friends came...

115
00:21:28,225 --> 00:21:33,094
First you spit your betel leaf
-Ok, Ranbirsingh and his...

116
00:21:33,164 --> 00:21:37,931
...friends want to stay in the
jungle for one month to hunt.

117
00:21:38,269 --> 00:21:42,569
They will give in cash. I have
said yes on your behalf.

118
00:21:43,073 --> 00:21:45,132
Was I right? - Very right!

119
00:21:47,077 --> 00:21:54,245
Has Naresh left any will with U
-Yes, but Court's approval...

120
00:21:54,318 --> 00:21:59,312
...is required, I will get that too.
But the Court needs to see...

121
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:03,622
...the murderer - When you
present that will in the Court...

122
00:22:03,861 --> 00:22:09,595
...please inform me. I will just
leave-Wait, come with me today

123
00:22:10,167 --> 00:22:15,833
Where?- See jungle's colours during
the day, tiger's colours at night.

124
00:22:16,106 --> 00:22:19,041
The curtain will rise and
we will see.

125
00:23:16,033 --> 00:23:20,493
Let me remain behind the curtain
and don't lift it.

126
00:23:26,243 --> 00:23:31,306
If the curtain is lifted,
the secret will be open

127
00:23:31,949 --> 00:23:33,974
Oh, my God!

128
00:24:32,543 --> 00:24:36,070
There are lot of sights
in my curtain.

129
00:24:36,146 --> 00:24:40,913
How will you meet
my eyes?

130
00:24:42,186 --> 00:24:45,451
Whenever I lift my veil
a little...

131
00:24:49,893 --> 00:24:56,025
...remember that you will
burn.

132
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:50,108
When the beauty is exposed...

133
00:25:51,288 --> 00:25:55,054
...that moment is unique.

134
00:25:56,593 --> 00:25:59,960
when one loses his senses...

135
00:26:04,201 --> 00:26:10,231
...one who is awake also
loses his senses.

136
00:27:05,295 --> 00:27:08,264
One who has made me...

137
00:27:10,501 --> 00:27:13,800
...also has not understood me.

138
00:27:15,139 --> 00:27:19,007
I have been made
beautiful...

139
00:27:22,946 --> 00:27:28,942
...and even the angels
have bowed before me.

140
00:27:33,223 --> 00:27:38,092
Let me remain behind the curtain
and don't lift it.

141
00:27:43,901 --> 00:27:48,031
If the curtain is lifted,
the secret will be open

142
00:27:48,639 --> 00:27:50,971
Oh, my God!

143
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:17,126
Wake up, sir. The dance
is over.

144
00:28:17,201 --> 00:28:19,465
Do you know this girl? -She is
the daughter of retired...

145
00:28:19,536 --> 00:28:22,835
...police commissioner, Mr.
Sharma - Mr Sharma's daughter

146
00:28:23,407 --> 00:28:28,037
She only dances in the charity
shows to help the orphans

147
00:28:53,937 --> 00:28:58,897
Please listen! -Yes, whom have
you come to meet?

148
00:28:59,343 --> 00:29:02,870
You! I have been searching for
you for a long time.

149
00:29:03,313 --> 00:29:06,544
You were searching me. What do
you mean to say?

150
00:29:07,117 --> 00:29:11,349
Don't you recogniZe me? That
night, you ran away from a house...

151
00:29:11,421 --> 00:29:12,820
...after the jeep accident,
That was my house only.

152
00:29:13,457 --> 00:29:19,555
Are you mad? What type of
accident- I took u in these arms

153
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:22,964
But when I left the house, you
were unconscious in my house

154
00:29:23,033 --> 00:29:28,494
How can you come to a girl's
house and talk nonsense like this

155
00:29:28,572 --> 00:29:32,440
Are'nt you scared of the police?
-I have no fear but you...

156
00:29:32,509 --> 00:29:34,909
...certainly fear and that is why
you want to hide the truth.

157
00:29:35,479 --> 00:29:39,381
Maybe you are also involved
in Naresh's murder - Me...

158
00:29:39,916 --> 00:29:43,477
Yes, when my friend Naresh was
killed on 13th October,...

159
00:29:43,553 --> 00:29:47,614
...where were you at that time?
-What nonsense?

160
00:29:48,258 --> 00:29:50,226
No one has dared to come till
today to my house and ask...

161
00:29:50,294 --> 00:29:52,262
...insolent questions to my
daughter.

162
00:29:52,529 --> 00:29:56,966
Since it is a matter of your
friend's murder, I'll answer you.

163
00:29:58,468 --> 00:30:00,959
My daughter was very much with
me on 13th October.

164
00:30:03,173 --> 00:30:05,607
But commissioner, my eyes can't
be cheated.

165
00:30:06,276 --> 00:30:09,302
That day the girl who had the
jeep accident was your daughter.

166
00:30:11,381 --> 00:30:15,340
After retirement, I have no other
work except taking care of my..

167
00:30:15,419 --> 00:30:18,911
...daughter. Do you think, I'll
allow her to roam in the jungle...

168
00:30:18,989 --> 00:30:21,924
...at midnight. That must be some
other girl- What do you mean?

169
00:30:22,292 --> 00:30:26,558
Is there any other girl with the
same looks? -lt is possible.

170
00:30:27,264 --> 00:30:31,064
How is it possible? -Dad, twin
sisters can only have same faces...

171
00:30:31,134 --> 00:30:37,198
... but not strangers. He is lying
-No, daughter. His friend has...

172
00:30:37,274 --> 00:30:43,179
...been murdered and people don't
lie on such serious matters.

173
00:30:44,247 --> 00:30:49,048
Do you have to ask anything else?
- Nothing else is there to ask.

174
00:30:49,886 --> 00:30:53,287
I am sorry, I had to
trouble you.

175
00:31:01,565 --> 00:31:04,261
Mulshi, has the ballistic
report on 302 come.

176
00:31:09,573 --> 00:31:11,040
Hello Ajay, come?

177
00:31:15,645 --> 00:31:23,984
Naresh's pistol was 0.32 and the
bullet taken out from his body...

178
00:31:24,054 --> 00:31:30,152
...was also the same. Maybe, he
got killed with his own pistol

179
00:31:30,927 --> 00:31:37,526
Could you find that pistol?
-Not until now. U got anything

180
00:31:38,168 --> 00:31:41,331
I got to know something else.
I doubt Police commissioner...

181
00:31:41,405 --> 00:31:48,174
...Sharma's daughter. -What?
-I saw her only today.

182
00:31:48,645 --> 00:31:52,376
Her face resembles the girl who
came to my house on the day...

183
00:31:52,449 --> 00:31:56,613
...of murder....
-Look at this too

184
00:32:05,362 --> 00:32:09,594
On the day of murder, Kiran was
there in our Police club dance.

185
00:32:10,167 --> 00:32:16,037
This photo was taken there.
If you had not dreamt in the...

186
00:32:16,106 --> 00:32:18,040
...jungle that day, you saw
another girl.

187
00:32:19,509 --> 00:32:23,343
Surprising, two girls with the
same face.

188
00:32:24,948 --> 00:32:31,319
Can I take this photo?
-Do you want to frame it...

189
00:32:31,388 --> 00:32:36,291
...and put it near the pillow?
-Not such colourful ideas.

190
00:32:37,294 --> 00:32:38,318
My intentions are quite decent.

191
00:32:48,305 --> 00:32:49,499
Madam, today's letters.

192
00:33:14,064 --> 00:33:18,364
Don't be surprised? This is not
your photo as the colour...

193
00:33:18,435 --> 00:33:21,927
...of the hair is different.
If you want to know who...

194
00:33:22,005 --> 00:33:27,500
...this girl is, meet me at this
address, Ajay Singh, Manager...

195
00:33:28,278 --> 00:33:29,609
...Timli Forest Estate.

196
00:33:48,965 --> 00:33:51,297
You are here. - But what are
you doing here?

197
00:33:52,102 --> 00:33:55,629
I am not what you think I am.
I am Mr. Sharma's daughter.

198
00:33:56,239 --> 00:34:00,938
I know you are Kiran and hence l
am surprised to see you here.

199
00:34:02,078 --> 00:34:05,946
And this is the same place, where
the jeep accident took place.

200
00:34:07,551 --> 00:34:12,318
Today also you think I am that
Jeep girl. But I've no complaints...

201
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:14,914
...against you. How could U know
that there are two girls with...

202
00:34:14,991 --> 00:34:21,453
...the same face but there are
surely two girls -ls that so?

203
00:34:22,365 --> 00:34:26,165
Who is the second? - Wait, let
Mr. Ajay Singh returns home.

204
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:29,505
He'll tell everything. I'm very
anxious to know the 2nd girl

205
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:36,070
Even Mr. Ajay Singh has not
found that there is a 2nd one

206
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:40,538
Mr. Ajay has learnt that & he
has himself written to me.

207
00:34:42,319 --> 00:34:45,482
That was to just learn whether
you are the murderer or not.

208
00:34:46,022 --> 00:34:50,322
What do you mean? - Yes, if
you were involved, you would...

209
00:34:50,393 --> 00:34:52,156
...never have come to this
estate during the day.

210
00:34:52,495 --> 00:34:56,022
So Mr. Ajay Singh believes now
that you are innocent.

211
00:34:56,466 --> 00:34:59,162
When did he see me?
I have not met him yet.

212
00:34:59,402 --> 00:35:03,361
You have met him and you
are talking with him now- What?

213
00:35:04,274 --> 00:35:05,070
Yes, I am only Ajay Singh.

214
00:35:06,376 --> 00:35:08,241
That means, you called me
home by fraud.

215
00:35:08,812 --> 00:35:14,011
Yes, problem was I saw someone
like you then & see you now.

216
00:35:14,351 --> 00:35:18,151
My house is not special but
allow me to serve you.

217
00:35:18,355 --> 00:35:20,949
Never. - Please accept
my invitation, madam

218
00:35:21,958 --> 00:35:25,485
When I found you innocent
I seem to have got lot of things

219
00:35:26,563 --> 00:35:30,397
Now I can't bear your anger.
Please forgive me now.

220
00:35:31,001 --> 00:35:35,938
I don't know what to tell you.
-Till now you called me...

221
00:35:36,006 --> 00:35:39,407
...Mr. Ajay Singh. Call me
Ajay now.

222
00:35:39,976 --> 00:35:46,040
One use for coming here is that
U don't consider me a killer now

223
00:35:46,483 --> 00:35:49,509
Do you really care about
what I think about you?

224
00:35:50,153 --> 00:35:55,455
It is a beautiful place and hence l
could not wait in your house...

225
00:35:55,525 --> 00:35:57,857
...and came walking here.
-This is nothing

226
00:35:58,428 --> 00:36:00,191
There are more beautiful places
in the jungle.

227
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:03,594
Let me take you for a drive.
Please come.

228
00:36:55,485 --> 00:36:58,454
The sparrow's children
-They're so beautiful

229
00:36:59,322 --> 00:37:00,914
Give me one or two children
for nurturing them.

230
00:37:01,224 --> 00:37:08,790
What? -I meant the sparrow's
children- I will just bring them

231
00:37:34,524 --> 00:37:36,458
Kiran, you start the jeep
and run away

232
00:37:47,036 --> 00:37:56,502
Ajay...
-Kiran, come towards me.

233
00:39:06,382 --> 00:39:11,285
How is my hair twisting on its
own? Is there any miracle in rice

234
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:15,987
There is surely some problem.

235
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:24,930
How do I look like?
-Like hot spices in style...

236
00:39:25,468 --> 00:39:28,164
...cheeks are like tomato and
lips are like carrot

237
00:39:28,605 --> 00:39:31,904
All these things are inside this.
This is a magical purse.

238
00:39:32,508 --> 00:39:33,805
Let me also see.

239
00:39:37,947 --> 00:39:42,077
Letter in rose. Is it in my name?
-Read and see.

240
00:39:44,053 --> 00:39:54,395
Na ra... Naresh
tu ma... Tum - Read it fast

241
00:39:55,131 --> 00:40:00,501
I've read it. The name of one
who writes letters is down.

242
00:40:02,472 --> 00:40:11,176
va.. ra.. Veera. This is our office
madam's name.

243
00:40:11,915 --> 00:40:15,351
Did you steal her purse?
-No, this is mine.

244
00:40:16,185 --> 00:40:19,484
But her name is written here
-Do you doubt me?

245
00:40:20,089 --> 00:40:22,455
Did'nt I tell you that it is mine?
-But name is different

246
00:40:23,159 --> 00:40:26,356
This is a strange puZZle
-Then solve it. - Shall l?

247
00:40:26,963 --> 00:40:31,161
Veer means bahadur (bravery)
and Veera is feminine of that

248
00:40:31,901 --> 00:40:37,237
I understood. I am Tejbahadur
and you are my brave girl.

249
00:40:37,874 --> 00:40:42,038
You have united our names in
this puZZle - Manager sir!

250
00:40:51,054 --> 00:40:55,218
I came without telling father.
It is very late, I'll leave now.

251
00:41:04,634 --> 00:41:08,126
This time, your photo became the
reason for our meeting.

252
00:41:08,905 --> 00:41:12,397
We need some reasons for
meeting again- Not necessary

253
00:41:19,515 --> 00:41:23,281
She came on her own and went.
Is she not unconscious today?

254
00:41:23,353 --> 00:41:28,950
Is she the same or another?
-I will find out as I have...

255
00:41:29,025 --> 00:41:31,653
...worked under a ClD also.
Let me think deeply

256
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:37,864
Leave your hair and heat some
water for fermentation as...

257
00:41:37,934 --> 00:41:41,062
...I have too much pain.- I will
massage now & you'll be ok.

258
00:41:43,006 --> 00:41:46,442
Neena has left and her
resignation has come in the post

259
00:41:48,211 --> 00:41:52,272
Where has she gone?- Surely
not where Naresh has gone.

260
00:41:52,915 --> 00:41:58,683
But I don't know why
Neena has left.

261
00:41:59,355 --> 00:42:04,156
There must be some danger.
-You mean from the police..

262
00:42:05,561 --> 00:42:10,055
No! Maybe from you. I heard
that girls are found unconscious...

263
00:42:10,133 --> 00:42:13,125
...in your house at midnight.
-Do you have any objections?

264
00:42:14,971 --> 00:42:19,533
I am jealous. I like to play with
danger, give me also a chance

265
00:42:19,976 --> 00:42:22,206
Veera, what is wrong with you?
U never behaved like this before

266
00:42:22,845 --> 00:42:24,938
You also never used to play such
dangerous games before

267
00:42:25,381 --> 00:42:30,444
Tell me, how was that jeep girl?
- I don't know

268
00:42:31,087 --> 00:42:34,079
It would have been easy to find
You could've looked in her...

269
00:42:34,157 --> 00:42:39,595
...handbag. You might have got
her visiting card & found address

270
00:42:40,029 --> 00:42:42,463
But why are you interested in
her handbag?

271
00:42:43,132 --> 00:42:52,040
I'm interested in U. I wanted to
know how far you went with her

272
00:42:52,875 --> 00:42:56,402
Do I still stand a chance?
-Sit here and work.

273
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:04,349
Whom do you want to meet?
-The Estate Manager but...

274
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:08,322
...I could not take away my
eyes from her first.

275
00:43:08,825 --> 00:43:10,349
Maybe you are the manager.
-Yes

276
00:43:10,993 --> 00:43:13,894
My full name is Ranbir Singh and
half name is Robby.

277
00:43:14,397 --> 00:43:17,127
That is why the lawyer
took only half your name.

278
00:43:18,067 --> 00:43:19,625
Veera, take out the contract
papers.

279
00:43:20,403 --> 00:43:23,372
He is Ranvir Singh and he will
stay with his party in the...

280
00:43:23,439 --> 00:43:25,339
...forest for a month. He has
come for hunting.

281
00:43:29,112 --> 00:43:29,407
Please sign the papers.

282
00:43:36,853 --> 00:43:40,914
Now you can't get rid of me. Got
a way to meet you by becoming...

283
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:44,016
...a stranger. - For your own
good, you remain as a stranger

284
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:47,327
Don't worry, I understand
everything.

285
00:44:12,488 --> 00:44:16,584
Ajay had only signed two papers.
How did this 3rd paper come?

286
00:44:17,093 --> 00:44:19,960
Are'nt the three signs alike?
- Absolutely alike.

287
00:44:20,396 --> 00:44:24,127
That is my great talent. There
must be some old papers here.

288
00:44:24,567 --> 00:44:28,833
Just show me, how Naresh's
signature is like. -Why?

289
00:44:29,205 --> 00:44:32,402
I will make his will and make
you the heir of all his wealth.

290
00:44:32,875 --> 00:44:35,844
Then, both of us will enjoy.
- In the jail...

291
00:44:36,279 --> 00:44:40,841
When did you have the brains
to think of Ur good and bad?

292
00:44:41,117 --> 00:44:42,277
That is why you were
thrown away.

293
00:44:43,085 --> 00:44:45,178
Quickly give me a sample
of Naresh's signature.

294
00:44:45,988 --> 00:44:52,894
You will never get it. - I will get
it & you know, you can't stop me

295
00:44:59,869 --> 00:45:07,173
That rose can be anybody's but l
might get a clue from hankie

296
00:45:08,945 --> 00:45:14,440
Ram Lakhan, bring water in a
plate. - For what, sir?

297
00:45:44,013 --> 00:45:46,880
This hankie is our evidence and
we can't tamper with it.

298
00:45:47,316 --> 00:45:50,513
We got it with dirt & we have
to present it in Court like that.

299
00:45:52,455 --> 00:45:57,017
If we don't catch the killer, dirt
will be thrown on our face in....

300
00:45:57,093 --> 00:45:58,583
...the Court. Understood!

301
00:46:00,062 --> 00:46:01,427
Let us present the dirt.

302
00:46:14,176 --> 00:46:19,239
V- means Veera.

303
00:46:25,621 --> 00:46:31,082
All my clothes are being
searched. Then will I also...

304
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:37,861
...be searched, lnspector -No, we
are searching for a small cloth

305
00:46:38,634 --> 00:46:45,403
Another hankie just like this.
-Your search can be completed.

306
00:46:52,248 --> 00:46:57,345
Where have you kept hankies?
-ln the shop and not here.

307
00:47:00,056 --> 00:47:04,789
By earning just 500 rupees, how
do you live in this grand house?

308
00:47:05,127 --> 00:47:11,862
How? Now I live only alone
that too in the nights

309
00:47:12,835 --> 00:47:15,599
What are your intentions?
-The present intention is...

310
00:47:15,838 --> 00:47:21,401
...that you stay somewhere else,
in the jail in the days & also nights

311
00:47:21,944 --> 00:47:29,248
No hankies were found -Now
also will U fulfil ur intentions

312
00:47:29,318 --> 00:47:35,951
Yes, my intentions are strong.
This hankie can be killer's...

313
00:47:36,025 --> 00:47:43,022
...and also can be yours.
V- means Veera. Come...

314
00:47:54,610 --> 00:47:58,512
Bombay High on 5th October,
what did the hotel manager...

315
00:47:58,581 --> 00:48:01,243
...say over the phone?
-8th October

316
00:48:03,285 --> 00:48:05,116
That means five days before
the murder.

317
00:48:06,288 --> 00:48:10,782
Come, we were just going
to call you, Ajay - Why?

318
00:48:11,427 --> 00:48:13,156
Do you want to arrest me along
with Veera?

319
00:48:13,562 --> 00:48:15,962
Relax, come with me.

320
00:48:18,367 --> 00:48:22,804
The culprit has surrendered
herself. A lone woman who...

321
00:48:22,872 --> 00:48:27,036
...Iived in Africa for 21 yrs and
returned to lndia 5 days...

322
00:48:27,109 --> 00:48:28,804
...before the murder. -But what
is her enemity with Naresh?

323
00:48:29,178 --> 00:48:32,045
Says that Naresh spoiled her
niece's life who is dear to...

324
00:48:32,114 --> 00:48:35,481
...her like a daughter and hence
she murdered her.

325
00:48:36,185 --> 00:48:41,384
That is the problem. She neither
reveals her niece's name...

326
00:48:41,457 --> 00:48:43,425
...nor her address.

327
00:48:45,194 --> 00:48:45,558
She is that old lady.

328
00:48:53,869 --> 00:48:57,361
Do you recogniZe her?
-Have you ever seen her...

329
00:48:57,506 --> 00:49:05,572
...near Naresh or near your
estate? - I've never seen her

330
00:49:08,951 --> 00:49:11,010
Sentry, bring her to my room

331
00:49:11,887 --> 00:49:13,912
She does not look from her
face that she is a killer.

332
00:49:14,290 --> 00:49:17,316
Has Naresh ever mentioned about
some Vimala Devi to you?

333
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:20,929
No, but he had mentioned about
his Aunt who is in Africa.

334
00:49:23,566 --> 00:49:28,868
Ajay, how is the jungle? Is it
still green or has dried as...

335
00:49:29,004 --> 00:49:33,964
...soon as I was caught -Since
the culprit has confessed...

336
00:49:34,109 --> 00:49:39,376
...can I take Veera with me
-No, I still have to investigate.

337
00:49:58,534 --> 00:50:04,564
Veera, do you know her
-Yes, she is a woman.

338
00:50:06,442 --> 00:50:13,905
Do you know this problematic
girl, Vimaladevi? - No

339
00:50:18,554 --> 00:50:23,890
Again I would ask you about
your niece. What is her name?

340
00:50:24,026 --> 00:50:28,895
I can't tell you as her repute is
under stake. - How is it?

341
00:50:29,498 --> 00:50:33,662
If it is known that Naresh had
spoiled her life and I have...

342
00:50:33,969 --> 00:50:36,631
...murdered him, then who
will marry her.

343
00:50:37,339 --> 00:50:41,935
Sir, we have got Vimala devi's
luggage from the hotel.

344
00:50:42,645 --> 00:50:52,486
We got some slippers also
and hankies.

345
00:51:03,065 --> 00:51:06,967
The same type of hankies
with the same letter.

346
00:51:08,170 --> 00:51:14,234
V- for Vimala. I told you before
only that the hankie is mine.

347
00:51:16,312 --> 00:51:17,836
Please sit down.

348
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:25,016
On the day of the murder, was
your niece also with you.

349
00:51:25,554 --> 00:51:29,251
I can't tell you as it is
a matter of her repute.

350
00:51:33,329 --> 00:51:37,925
Did you wear high-heeled
slippers when you went to...

351
00:51:38,067 --> 00:51:40,194
...Naresh's house on that night.
-Yes - How was that?

352
00:51:41,136 --> 00:51:43,366
You have the habit of wearing
normal slippers which were...

353
00:51:43,505 --> 00:51:48,272
...only found in your room. - l
am wearing that slippers now.

354
00:51:48,410 --> 00:51:54,576
Are these slippers yours or have
you taken your niece's slippers...

355
00:51:54,883 --> 00:51:57,613
...after the murder to take her
blame on your name.

356
00:51:58,354 --> 00:52:03,121
One idea. You make her run a lot
with these slippers. If she slips...

357
00:52:07,029 --> 00:52:09,395
Where is the pistol with which
you committed the murder?

358
00:52:10,366 --> 00:52:14,826
When you have surrendered, why
do you want to hide the pistol?

359
00:52:15,504 --> 00:52:20,339
I can't tell you as my niece's
repute...-... is at stake

360
00:52:21,176 --> 00:52:26,079
She is repeating the same like a
parrot. -Will you be quiet?

361
00:52:35,024 --> 00:52:39,290
What are you seeing? - You!
-What did you see in me?

362
00:52:40,162 --> 00:52:44,656
Innocence - Is it? That day l
looked like a killer to you.

363
00:52:46,435 --> 00:52:50,895
You are still the killer of my
heart. - Let us go

364
00:52:51,573 --> 00:52:55,634
What happened? -My eyes...
-Shall I see?

365
00:53:00,215 --> 00:53:04,982
There is nothing...You were
acting and made me a fool

366
00:53:05,454 --> 00:53:08,981
The hunter has himself become
the hunt in your beauty

367
00:53:22,304 --> 00:53:29,176
I have become restless
in your love.

368
00:53:30,913 --> 00:53:37,375
I came to hunt but got
hunted instead.

369
00:54:10,085 --> 00:54:17,514
When I saw you nearby,
I lost my heart.

370
00:54:17,826 --> 00:54:25,255
Your style has completely
hit me.

371
00:54:27,302 --> 00:54:33,400
I am attracted by each
style of yours.

372
00:54:43,051 --> 00:54:49,479
I came to hunt but got
hunted instead.

373
00:55:06,575 --> 00:55:13,208
Your eyes are telling
about love

374
00:55:13,348 --> 00:55:21,187
You are surely searching
for someone

375
00:55:30,432 --> 00:55:37,361
I have found this secret and
became close to you

376
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:44,911
I came to hunt but got
hunted instead.

377
00:56:01,997 --> 00:56:09,403
I lost my senses and
don't know where I am?

378
00:56:10,305 --> 00:56:17,108
This is called love,
my dear

379
00:56:26,221 --> 00:56:33,059
I have been struck
by your love

380
00:56:34,096 --> 00:56:41,901
I came to hunt but got
hunted instead.

381
00:57:00,555 --> 00:57:04,286
Greetings, Manager sir
-Are you hurt? - No, sir

382
00:57:04,927 --> 00:57:11,093
We just came out to roam
-Yes, sir - Come, Kiran.

383
00:57:13,035 --> 00:57:18,803
I am in a dilemma for a long
time. Shall I tell or not?

384
00:57:19,374 --> 00:57:25,210
What are you doing here?-Dad..
-I told you never to come...

385
00:57:25,347 --> 00:57:27,144
...this side, come home

386
00:57:41,863 --> 00:57:48,325
Inspector Rai here -Rai, I am
Sharma - How are you?

387
00:57:49,004 --> 00:57:54,499
I heard that a woman has
surrendered for Naresh's murder

388
00:57:55,143 --> 00:57:59,580
Who is that? - She has come
from Africa and does not...

389
00:57:59,848 --> 00:58:02,510
...reveal anything about herself.
- Why not?

390
00:58:03,251 --> 00:58:06,015
I doubt that she is taking her
niece's blame on her head.

391
00:58:06,488 --> 00:58:11,391
If we can find her niece,
the whole case will be solved.

392
00:58:16,231 --> 00:58:18,995
How are you interested in this
case suddenly?

393
00:58:21,536 --> 00:58:25,336
As I am an old policeman...
Very few murderers surrender...

394
00:58:25,474 --> 00:58:28,841
...themselves to the police.
This is an interesting case.

395
00:59:00,409 --> 00:59:01,899
The signatures are here.

396
00:59:06,281 --> 00:59:09,011
Robby, what did you take
out from that cabinet?

397
00:59:09,818 --> 00:59:15,814
Keys to our dream through which
the whole property will be ours.

398
00:59:16,324 --> 00:59:20,260
Fool, do you want the
police to doubt me again.

399
00:59:20,862 --> 00:59:24,798
How is that? -Police are still
searching for a reason for...

400
00:59:24,933 --> 00:59:28,869
...Naresh's murder. If you make a
will, police will think that...

401
00:59:29,004 --> 00:59:31,404
...I have only killed him
for the sake of property.

402
00:59:31,907 --> 00:59:35,843
Don't worry, since the old woman
has taken the blame on her head...

403
00:59:36,378 --> 00:59:39,506
...she'll have to hang now-When
did U become so stone-hearted

404
00:59:40,148 --> 00:59:43,208
From the time I hoped to become
a millionaire- Give that paper

405
00:59:43,819 --> 00:59:49,451
It will go here. -Never, Robby
-Don't fight unnecessarily.

406
00:59:53,161 --> 00:59:57,257
Robby...-What is wrong with
you? Are you more powerful?

407
00:59:59,835 --> 01:00:04,636
How is this power?
-Less than me

408
01:00:15,484 --> 01:00:18,419
No, Ajay, forgive him for my
sake

409
01:00:19,087 --> 01:00:23,888
Now only you were abusing him.
Then why this sympathy?

410
01:00:24,292 --> 01:00:32,097
Are you jealous? -Robby, go
away from here. - Ok

411
01:00:37,906 --> 01:00:42,570
Tell the truth about your relation
with him -I'm connected to you.

412
01:00:43,178 --> 01:00:46,511
I did not want you to murder
because of me.

413
01:00:55,557 --> 01:01:00,051
What is this, Ranbir Singh? is
this Naresh's signature? - 100%

414
01:01:00,829 --> 01:01:03,093
He has written all the property
in Veera's name.

415
01:01:07,202 --> 01:01:10,865
Read properly. Why are you
acting like a chameleon?

416
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:16,907
You call me a Nag as I will
protect Naresh's property like...

417
01:01:17,045 --> 01:01:21,914
...a snake. - Then Nagraj, get
that property for Veera soon.

418
01:01:22,551 --> 01:01:27,045
Why are you hurrying so much?
Have you got Veera in Ur hands?

419
01:01:27,656 --> 01:01:30,352
I will fill your hands also with
money, if you so wish.

420
01:01:30,492 --> 01:01:33,484
Shall we go? We will present
this will in Court today.

421
01:01:34,262 --> 01:01:37,425
Definitely. Immediately I will
call the police - Why?

422
01:01:38,133 --> 01:01:42,627
Police will take you to the jail
with this false will.

423
01:01:43,371 --> 01:01:48,035
How can you call this a false
will? Do you have eyes or not?

424
01:01:48,176 --> 01:01:49,507
Can't you recogniZe Naresh's
signature?

425
01:01:50,011 --> 01:01:53,970
I recogniZe it, but you don't
recogniZe me.

426
01:01:54,449 --> 01:01:59,386
Go and see the board outside.
Satyamurthy stands for truth.

427
01:02:00,055 --> 01:02:04,082
I will present the real will and
not the false will.

428
01:02:05,026 --> 01:02:12,296
Which true will? -Naresh's real
will is locked inside that alimirah

429
01:02:14,069 --> 01:02:16,902
If Naresh had made any other
will, news would have spread.

430
01:02:17,405 --> 01:02:21,307
Where was the time to spread
it? He wrote the will in the...

431
01:02:21,443 --> 01:02:27,871
...morning and got killed in the
night. - Then this will...

432
01:02:28,416 --> 01:02:33,911
This is false and you are a
fraud and talked of bribing me.

433
01:02:34,556 --> 01:02:38,925
I am sorry to have made that
mistake- Don't repeat this.

434
01:02:40,128 --> 01:02:41,595
You will fill only my hands.

435
01:02:46,501 --> 01:02:53,373
Talk about filling the locker.
-That means you're my partner

436
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:14,954
You delayed so long in coming
-Why did you call me?

437
01:03:17,999 --> 01:03:22,436
Is it necessary to tell?
-No, I will go away.

438
01:03:23,171 --> 01:03:28,199
Why, have you lost the interest
in the murder now?

439
01:03:29,110 --> 01:03:31,340
Did you find anything about
the murderer? - Yes

440
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:47,460
Who is the murderer?
- Present in this same house.

441
01:03:50,865 --> 01:03:53,356
I am ready to give my life
for such a long time, but...

442
01:03:53,501 --> 01:03:56,231
...the fellow is not coming
near at all.

443
01:04:26,968 --> 01:04:31,337
Please come near me.
Where are your thoughts?

444
01:04:32,173 --> 01:04:40,444
Meet my eyes with your eyes.
Where are your thoughts?

445
01:05:19,587 --> 01:05:24,490
See this side also,
my dear love

446
01:05:26,895 --> 01:05:30,991
This time won't come often,
where are you lost, dear?

447
01:06:13,241 --> 01:06:17,837
I am lying on your way.
Take as much as you wish.

448
01:06:20,114 --> 01:06:24,448
Your troubles are also sweet.
Trouble me as much as you wish

449
01:07:06,361 --> 01:07:11,196
My innocent heart is yearning.
Will be difficult if u don't agree?

450
01:07:13,301 --> 01:07:18,102
How much can I explain to you?
Become mine, my killer

451
01:07:26,247 --> 01:07:30,377
Please come near me.
Where are your thoughts?

452
01:07:35,156 --> 01:07:40,025
Meet my eyes with your eyes.
Where are your thoughts?

453
01:08:04,319 --> 01:08:13,159
Naresh Mathur, 12th October.
That means this envelope..

454
01:08:13,294 --> 01:08:17,128
...was sent to Naresh one day
before the murder.

455
01:08:19,467 --> 01:08:24,564
Where are your thoughts?
Life is behind you or in front

456
01:08:25,340 --> 01:08:29,003
Why do you worry about the
dead? Leave it

457
01:08:30,011 --> 01:08:35,313
Leave this acting. You called me
here to give this envelope.

458
01:08:35,984 --> 01:08:41,422
I got that book from Naresh's
library only yesterday.

459
01:08:42,123 --> 01:08:46,253
I did'nt know that this envelope
was inside that book.-Don't act.

460
01:08:47,462 --> 01:08:50,397
Where is the letter inside
this envelope? -Not with me

461
01:08:51,165 --> 01:08:57,126
You can search if you wish.
-My constables do that work.

462
01:08:57,972 --> 01:09:03,000
You are fully ice. I will get some
hot thing to melt you.

463
01:09:12,020 --> 01:09:16,787
The same handwriting, sir. -That
means our old commissioner...

464
01:09:16,924 --> 01:09:18,824
...wrote this letter to Naresh.

465
01:09:22,130 --> 01:09:23,290
And these shoe marks of
a man...

466
01:09:32,106 --> 01:09:39,911
No, I want to speak with
Mr.Bose, Fingerprint expert.

467
01:09:44,318 --> 01:09:47,344
I am Sharma. What happened to
your report?

468
01:09:48,256 --> 01:09:51,225
It is so long since I sent you the
sample of the finger-print.

469
01:09:52,060 --> 01:09:55,621
The same finger-prints are there
on the pistol.

470
01:09:57,498 --> 01:10:01,525
No, don't send it by parcel.
I am immediately coming to Delhi

471
01:10:03,404 --> 01:10:07,204
Why are you going to Delhi?
-Some work has come about.

472
01:10:08,076 --> 01:10:15,573
To bring something- Till I come
back, you don't go out of house.

473
01:10:16,284 --> 01:10:19,219
Why not? -You ask too many
questions.

474
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:41,133
Come, Madam. Sir has ordered
to release you.

475
01:10:51,986 --> 01:10:54,284
Sir, will it be proper to
release that woman?

476
01:10:54,989 --> 01:10:57,514
Till now, we have not found any
other killer.

477
01:10:58,359 --> 01:11:03,092
To find the killer, we have
to find her niece.

478
01:11:03,998 --> 01:11:07,195
The niece and aunt can't enquire
about each other in the jail.

479
01:11:08,102 --> 01:11:10,593
You feel that the real murderer
is her niece.

480
01:11:11,439 --> 01:11:13,066
Don't give the passport to
Vimaladevi now.

481
01:11:13,875 --> 01:11:15,934
Keep a watch over where she
goes and whom she meets...

482
01:11:16,077 --> 01:11:17,942
...for all 24 hours.

483
01:11:21,082 --> 01:11:25,041
Are you still there? come up.
Nobody can see us here.

484
01:11:25,853 --> 01:11:27,844
If I come up, who will look
after your cows

485
01:11:28,422 --> 01:11:30,083
They won't go anywhere
You come up.

486
01:11:42,003 --> 01:11:45,439
Why is the pistol here?-Again
you stopped. come fast..

487
01:11:46,574 --> 01:11:48,974
See the sweet grapes I got for
you. Eat it.

488
01:11:49,110 --> 01:11:52,944
This is not the time to eat
but the time to think.

489
01:11:55,349 --> 01:11:59,115
Fruits and flowers are only
found on trees.

490
01:11:59,253 --> 01:12:04,156
How did this pistol come here?
Are there more?

491
01:12:06,127 --> 01:12:09,096
Why are you feeding with your
hands? Am I a kid?

492
01:12:10,364 --> 01:12:11,831
God, which fool have I got
stuck with?

493
01:12:12,567 --> 01:12:15,001
He neither knows to love
nor wants to learn.

494
01:12:15,636 --> 01:12:18,503
Till when do I break my head?
-Don't break your head

495
01:12:19,173 --> 01:12:21,573
I know everything about love.
I worked under Majnu also

496
01:12:23,044 --> 01:12:26,036
Who is that? - He is the
master of love

497
01:12:26,614 --> 01:12:32,075
Then you should know everything
about love, romance, union etc.

498
01:12:33,421 --> 01:12:39,087
I know only about mango juice
Have had it also many times?

499
01:12:39,627 --> 01:12:43,290
Fool, there is great fun in
the union of two.

500
01:12:47,869 --> 01:12:51,635
Father... -Rogue, get down.
-Why?

501
01:12:52,173 --> 01:12:54,971
Get down.
-Don't try to order, fatso

502
01:12:56,244 --> 01:12:58,439
Why has your dad gone to Delhi?
-I don't know.

503
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:01,544
When I asked, he changed the
topic. Maybe some secret matter.

504
01:13:02,383 --> 01:13:04,476
Great! These old men never
reveal their secrets but...

505
01:13:04,619 --> 01:13:06,348
...are always anxious to know
the secrets of the youth.

506
01:13:06,487 --> 01:13:10,321
That day he came till the jungle.
-Yes, he was very angry...

507
01:13:10,458 --> 01:13:15,225
...after reaching home-Why?
-He fears that we will...

508
01:13:16,464 --> 01:13:21,265
We will...
-This is what he fears.

509
01:13:22,136 --> 01:13:25,299
He has banned me from meeting
you.-But you did'nt listen to him

510
01:13:26,107 --> 01:13:27,870
I have listened to him always,
but..-The heart does'nt listen.

511
01:13:28,376 --> 01:13:36,078
Yes, that is the difficulty - Dad
only orders once in a while.

512
01:13:36,884 --> 01:13:39,910
But this heart compels me every
moment. How long we can avoid?

513
01:13:40,488 --> 01:13:45,084
You should not avoid it and
should listen to your heart.

514
01:14:02,443 --> 01:14:05,105
Kiran, you stay here.
I will just come.

515
01:14:31,172 --> 01:14:33,640
Where were you till now?
-What are you doing here?

516
01:14:34,976 --> 01:14:38,275
Waiting for you. -Were you
searching for me in the almirah

517
01:14:39,080 --> 01:14:42,345
I was searching for the bottle,
dear. Came with a romantic...

518
01:14:42,483 --> 01:14:45,919
...mood from the house, but the
intoxication was lost in waiting.

519
01:14:46,487 --> 01:14:49,354
Where have you hidden the
bottles?- In your thoughts...

520
01:14:50,624 --> 01:14:54,390
Get up... - So much strength
in your arms.

521
01:14:55,262 --> 01:15:00,564
Lifted me like a flower which I'm
-You look like a snake to me.

522
01:15:01,469 --> 01:15:02,993
Tell me truly, what you had
come to search for here?

523
01:15:03,838 --> 01:15:08,901
Only you, dear. You're such a
romantic hunter, who would...

524
01:15:09,043 --> 01:15:12,137
...not wish to like hunted.
-Shall I take out the revolver?

525
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:17,817
Take me into my arms. I am in
intoxication. Please hold me.

526
01:15:18,452 --> 01:15:20,249
Keep on holding each other.
I am leaving.

527
01:15:20,988 --> 01:15:26,392
Listen to me, Kiran. -When did
the hunter get hunted?

528
01:15:27,161 --> 01:15:30,562
How many people have you
caught in your net? See you!

529
01:15:34,368 --> 01:15:39,328
Kiran, listen to me. - Leave my
hand. You left me outside...

530
01:15:39,473 --> 01:15:42,340
...so that you can get a chance
with her -You are mistaken.

531
01:15:43,177 --> 01:15:44,838
Her name is Veera and she
works in our office.

532
01:15:45,413 --> 01:15:48,439
I have no other relation with her
-Then, why was she in Ur arms.

533
01:15:49,183 --> 01:15:54,086
Go and pacify your lover -
Enough! You are a fool.

534
01:15:54,855 --> 01:15:56,083
If she had come to romance with
me, she would not have...

535
01:15:56,223 --> 01:15:58,248
...been searching and scattering
the things of my house.

536
01:16:20,214 --> 01:16:21,977
Oh! The petrol has got over.

537
01:16:23,984 --> 01:16:30,947
My queen, have you seen
the effect of my call?

538
01:16:31,859 --> 01:16:34,293
Yes, I have seen the effect.

539
01:16:46,340 --> 01:16:53,269
You had to stop... Did you see
the effect of my loyalty?

540
01:16:54,014 --> 01:16:56,505
Yes, I have seen the effect.

541
01:16:58,619 --> 01:17:01,417
Listen to me, Kiran
-Go and tell your lover

542
01:17:01,989 --> 01:17:04,082
What relation do you have with
me? Go to her.

543
01:17:05,459 --> 01:17:08,860
Leave my hand... I am telling you
to leave my hand or else...

544
01:17:12,833 --> 01:17:19,136
If the love is true, even
the time stops!

545
01:17:19,974 --> 01:17:21,942
The time may stop, but l
will not stop.

546
01:17:22,610 --> 01:17:28,549
Even if the sky is very high,
it will bow down.

547
01:17:29,383 --> 01:17:36,312
Did you see the effect of
the blessings of the heart?

548
01:17:36,457 --> 01:17:39,449
Yes, I have seen the effect.

549
01:17:52,306 --> 01:17:54,331
Have heard that the anger of a
beauty can make one lose his...

550
01:17:54,475 --> 01:17:57,035
...senses. Today, the petrol of
your jeep evoporated in ur anger

551
01:17:59,046 --> 01:18:00,308
Don't go that side. It is very
dangerous there.

552
01:18:00,915 --> 01:18:01,904
There are many wild
animals there

553
01:18:02,383 --> 01:18:05,045
Maybe, but not more dangerous
than you.

554
01:18:07,154 --> 01:18:13,821
The clouds have come down
to your feet.

555
01:18:13,961 --> 01:18:23,029
Don't try to fool me
-lt has become your cover

556
01:18:23,904 --> 01:18:30,275
Have you seen the effect of
the call of a sad lover?

557
01:18:30,544 --> 01:18:33,980
Yes, I have seen the effect.

558
01:19:01,575 --> 01:19:08,139
A smile has come in your
flower-like face, which...

559
01:19:08,282 --> 01:19:17,520
...brought about happiness
in thousand colours

560
01:19:17,825 --> 01:19:24,389
You have seen the effect
of the path of love.

561
01:19:24,531 --> 01:19:28,467
Yes, I have seen the effect.

562
01:19:29,403 --> 01:19:36,206
My queen, have you seen
the effect of my call?

563
01:19:36,610 --> 01:19:40,102
Yes, I have seen the effect.

564
01:19:42,383 --> 01:19:44,078
How do I go to the city
which is 20 miles from here?

565
01:19:44,451 --> 01:19:47,852
Now there is no chance. Whoever
goes to the city to get petrol...

566
01:19:47,988 --> 01:19:51,583
...will only get the morning bus.
-What? That means the night..

567
01:19:52,259 --> 01:19:53,851
You will spend the whole
night in this poor man's house

568
01:19:55,129 --> 01:19:57,495
If dad comes to know...- He
would'nt come to know.

569
01:19:58,265 --> 01:20:02,292
I will leave you in the morning.
Come now- No... - Come

570
01:20:19,286 --> 01:20:21,379
Why are you sharpening
that weapon, brother?

571
01:20:31,031 --> 01:20:38,369
Drink this. - I understood, U're
giving me water before killing me

572
01:20:38,505 --> 01:20:42,498
This is not water but liquor
-Then I won't drink.

573
01:20:43,344 --> 01:20:47,337
Before taking one into our caste,
we make him drink liquor.

574
01:20:48,182 --> 01:20:50,480
But I am Kshatriya and can't
mix with your caste.

575
01:20:51,251 --> 01:20:53,014
Won't you mix...Sharpen the
weapon.

576
01:20:54,054 --> 01:20:56,045
What is this you are doing,
brother?

577
01:20:56,190 --> 01:21:00,923
Am I your brother? I am Mowa's
father. -Why are you torturing...

578
01:21:01,061 --> 01:21:05,521
...me like this? My young age is
not meant to get burnt to ashes.

579
01:21:06,133 --> 01:21:10,331
I accept to convert to your caste.
Give me that drink. -Ok, drink.

580
01:21:12,439 --> 01:21:19,845
So bad! - Drink it...
-So bitter...

581
01:21:20,447 --> 01:21:23,041
Do you know why we have taken
you in our caste?

582
01:21:25,386 --> 01:21:26,512
All of you are wild...

583
01:21:27,988 --> 01:21:32,254
I did'nt mean to say that noone
has brains in your caste.

584
01:21:32,393 --> 01:21:35,954
Tejbahadur's brain is famous
throughout the world.

585
01:21:36,864 --> 01:21:39,458
Is this why, you are taking me
in your caste? - Fool...

586
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:43,229
If a girl from our group loves a
man from another caste...

587
01:21:43,370 --> 01:21:48,103
...we cut the necks of both of
them -Why're you after my neck?

588
01:21:48,675 --> 01:21:52,543
Which fool loves your daughter?
-What are you saying?

589
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:56,977
I am telling the truth. You are
forcibly cutting my neck.

590
01:21:57,484 --> 01:22:00,885
Sharpen the weapon more.
-Atleast listen to me properly.

591
01:22:01,588 --> 01:22:05,024
Tell clearly, did you not love
Mowa?

592
01:22:10,130 --> 01:22:12,462
Why are you nodding your
head from behind?

593
01:22:12,599 --> 01:22:15,591
You may not care for your neck,
but I care.

594
01:22:16,403 --> 01:22:20,237
Tell fast, whether you love
Mowa or not?

595
01:22:22,109 --> 01:22:24,976
What is that? -Don't you know?
You are lying

596
01:22:25,646 --> 01:22:30,242
I've never lied. I have worked
under King Harishchandra also.

597
01:22:31,051 --> 01:22:33,451
Now your brain will be set
alright under this sword.

598
01:22:34,221 --> 01:22:35,153
Open him...
Fast...

599
01:22:38,192 --> 01:22:42,856
By leaving me, you have all
called your death.

600
01:22:44,064 --> 01:22:49,866
I am the strong Bajrangbali...
-Cut his neck...

601
01:22:51,472 --> 01:22:54,930
No, father. I beg at your feet.
-Don't do any drama.

602
01:22:55,609 --> 01:22:58,510
I have also worked under
a wrestler.

603
01:23:07,521 --> 01:23:10,285
Now tell me, did U see the
speed, Sasur (Father-in-law)?

604
01:23:10,924 --> 01:23:14,360
What did you say now... Sasur?
-Yes, I said it.

605
01:23:15,128 --> 01:23:20,088
Till I was mild, you were roaring
like a lion. Again I'll say Sasura.

606
01:23:20,234 --> 01:23:25,137
I wanted to hear this only.
Come and embrace me - Sure!

607
01:23:52,399 --> 01:23:54,458
No... No...

608
01:24:03,110 --> 01:24:05,601
Don't come ahead...
Don't come near.

609
01:24:19,593 --> 01:24:23,290
Kiran, did you get scared
of me? - No...

610
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:30,131
Then, who was there in your
heart? - I don't remember

611
01:24:31,638 --> 01:24:34,368
Then, you go to sleep.

612
01:24:53,093 --> 01:24:56,961
What happened, Kiran? -Be near
me -I'm near you only.

613
01:24:57,097 --> 01:25:04,230
I am scared. Stay near me.
Very much near me.

614
01:25:21,121 --> 01:25:23,248
When will we meet again?
-Whenever we get a chance..

615
01:25:24,424 --> 01:25:25,857
When will we get that?
-Ask the God above.

616
01:25:25,993 --> 01:25:34,196
God... Your dad is there
-Wait... Come inside.

617
01:25:42,175 --> 01:25:45,008
I see that your relationship with
Kiran has come to a dangerous...

618
01:25:45,145 --> 01:25:47,511
...situation. Tell me clearly about
your intentions.

619
01:25:49,082 --> 01:25:54,019
Intentions are correct. But seeing
this cigar, I remember that...

620
01:25:54,154 --> 01:26:00,150
...when the girl vanished from my
house on that night, a man...

621
01:26:00,293 --> 01:26:01,021
...who smokes cigar had also
come to my house....

622
01:26:02,195 --> 01:26:06,222
...maybe to take that girl back.
-I have no relation with that girl

623
01:26:06,967 --> 01:26:09,128
I am only talking about my
daughter, Kiran.

624
01:26:09,836 --> 01:26:13,795
I am also talking about her and
you know this very well.

625
01:26:14,441 --> 01:26:18,935
I only know that when you came
to see Kiran for the first time...

626
01:26:19,079 --> 01:26:22,571
...you were searching for the
murderer - I'm still searching.

627
01:26:23,483 --> 01:26:28,284
There have been many suspects,
but I can't come to a conclusion.

628
01:26:30,357 --> 01:26:33,087
But my heart surely says that
Kiran is innocent.

629
01:26:33,593 --> 01:26:37,620
She might be deceived by you.
I won't be deceived.

630
01:26:38,365 --> 01:26:40,560
Do you want to entangle her
in problems?

631
01:26:42,335 --> 01:26:44,895
I want to keep her away from
even the shadow of problems.

632
01:26:45,972 --> 01:26:49,567
Trust me, I will always trust my
heart regarding Kiran.

633
01:26:55,482 --> 01:26:59,646
You know that Kiran is my only
daughter. If you deceive her...

634
01:26:59,886 --> 01:27:05,916
...I won't leave you alive.
- I accept the challenge.

635
01:27:07,027 --> 01:27:10,827
The day I deceive her, you can
punish me in a way you wish.

636
01:27:17,404 --> 01:27:22,501
I sometimes smoke cigar
whenever I am upset.

637
01:27:23,343 --> 01:27:28,610
Come and eat with us. -I have
some important work today

638
01:27:28,915 --> 01:27:30,109
I will come some other day.

639
01:27:31,585 --> 01:27:35,453
How are you here?-Had to
consult with you regarding...

640
01:27:35,589 --> 01:27:40,356
...Naresh's murder. It's a strange
coincidence that Ajay is here.

641
01:27:41,294 --> 01:27:46,129
Why is it strange? -Ajay had
said some days before that...

642
01:27:46,266 --> 01:27:51,101
...Kiran was the girl who was in
his house on the day of murder.

643
01:27:51,505 --> 01:27:56,408
So, you have come to consult.
Go ahead and do it.

644
01:27:58,945 --> 01:28:04,815
Sit down. Tell me what
you want to ask.

645
01:28:07,788 --> 01:28:11,224
The day Naresh was murdered,
he had received a letter...

646
01:28:11,358 --> 01:28:15,226
...which was inside this envelope.

647
01:28:24,805 --> 01:28:27,137
Only the envelope, where is
the letter?

648
01:28:28,008 --> 01:28:31,944
If I had got it, I would not have
disturbed you, sir

649
01:28:33,346 --> 01:28:36,110
I feel that through this hand-
writing, we can find who has...

650
01:28:36,249 --> 01:28:39,946
...written the letter first.
What do you advise?

651
01:28:40,453 --> 01:28:45,914
Stop acting, Rai. You know, this
is my writing. I wrote the letter.

652
01:28:46,626 --> 01:28:48,093
Do you want to ask anything
else?

653
01:28:49,529 --> 01:28:52,498
What did you write in that
letter?

654
01:28:54,267 --> 01:28:59,933
I had invited him to come
to the Police Club Dance.

655
01:29:00,907 --> 01:29:03,569
It is obvious that you did not
have any deep friendship with...

656
01:29:03,877 --> 01:29:09,838
...him, or we would've known.
- Just a small acquaintance.

657
01:29:10,483 --> 01:29:15,352
Then it is surprising that you
invited him. Heard that he was...

658
01:29:15,488 --> 01:29:20,551
...a very romantic man. Did he
have any relation with Kiran?

659
01:29:21,127 --> 01:29:25,257
I am not interested in answering
such insolent questions.

660
01:29:27,300 --> 01:29:33,239
I'm sorry, but that day on the
phone, you did not even mention...

661
01:29:33,373 --> 01:29:37,275
...that you knew Naresh - I did
not say it as you did not ask.

662
01:29:38,111 --> 01:29:40,204
I had asked you about your
interest in the murder and you...

663
01:29:40,347 --> 01:29:44,147
...said it was due to your old
days..- As an old police officer...

664
01:29:47,320 --> 01:29:48,947
Or as a brother-in-law or
as a father.

665
01:29:51,124 --> 01:29:57,620
Ask clearly whatever you want
to...-That old woman only...

666
01:29:57,931 --> 01:30:01,526
...repeats continuously that
Naresh spoiled her niece's life...

667
01:30:01,835 --> 01:30:06,135
...and so she killed her. This is
strange, as the girl who has...

668
01:30:06,273 --> 01:30:10,004
...been effected should have
killed but the aunt came here.

669
01:30:11,011 --> 01:30:14,071
Don't get distracted. If you think
that the old woman is Kiran's...

670
01:30:14,214 --> 01:30:18,548
...aunt, you are wrong - But the
shoe marks can't be wrong.

671
01:30:19,419 --> 01:30:25,415
At the place of murder, marks
of a lady's slipper and also...

672
01:30:25,558 --> 01:30:29,119
...a man's shoes were found.
I doubt three women who...

673
01:30:29,262 --> 01:30:32,959
...wear high-heeled shoes. But
two of them have no close...

674
01:30:33,099 --> 01:30:36,967
...relations with any man.
-And the third girl...

675
01:30:39,239 --> 01:30:47,112
She is your daughter. The siZe of
shoemarks found is No. 8

676
01:30:47,948 --> 01:30:50,644
I think that you also wear
shoes of siZe 8.

677
01:30:53,019 --> 01:30:57,080
You had come for my advice.
I advise U to go from here now

678
01:30:57,691 --> 01:31:02,355
If you want to enter my house
again, come with a warrant.

679
01:31:06,232 --> 01:31:12,831
I am sorry. I have learnt to be
duty bound only from you.

680
01:31:13,907 --> 01:31:17,274
I'll feel very sad if I am required
to bring a warrant to your house

681
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:30,021
What did you say? Will the
property go to Veera?

682
01:31:30,857 --> 01:31:33,621
But Naresh's will had not
even mentioned Veera's name.

683
01:31:33,960 --> 01:31:39,762
What do U know? Naresh wrote
the will & died the same night

684
01:31:40,567 --> 01:31:42,125
Naresh himself told me before
his death that his property...

685
01:31:42,202 --> 01:31:47,504
...will go to his Aunty
-What? - I will send you to jail

686
01:31:48,074 --> 01:31:52,738
You are all frauds & want to
snatch the rights of old woman

687
01:31:53,179 --> 01:31:56,012
I am not a fraud. Go and see the
board again.

688
01:31:56,750 --> 01:31:59,116
Satyamurthy & Satykirthy that
is the double Satya (Truth)

689
01:31:59,185 --> 01:32:03,747
I will double your face also.
Tell the truth. Where is the...

690
01:32:03,823 --> 01:32:05,688
....real will? -I told you that l
have given it in the Court.

691
01:32:06,659 --> 01:32:09,719
Don't lie. I will break your bones.
-Why are you wresting with...

692
01:32:09,796 --> 01:32:14,631
...a man who fights cases.
-Tell the truth...

693
01:32:15,001 --> 01:32:18,596
Who came to you with the
false will? - Ranvir...

694
01:32:22,976 --> 01:32:25,945
So Veera and Ranvir Singh are
in a combined conspiracy.

695
01:32:26,546 --> 01:32:28,810
That day Veera had come
to my house. For what!

696
01:32:36,756 --> 01:32:39,554
As soon as Veera gets the
property, we are rich...

697
01:32:39,626 --> 01:32:41,617
Why should it come to me?
-My great talents...

698
01:32:42,062 --> 01:32:45,759
That will has reached the Court.
- I had objected to it, then...

699
01:32:45,832 --> 01:32:47,527
...why did you make that
false will.

700
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:51,058
I knew that you will not go
against me.

701
01:32:51,704 --> 01:32:54,935
You will have to be with me
-You scoundrel...

702
01:32:55,508 --> 01:32:57,476
You want to misuse my
compulsions.

703
01:32:58,111 --> 01:33:00,909
Robby, see there.

704
01:33:06,886 --> 01:33:11,255
What happened, Teju?
-Very bad custom, brother

705
01:33:12,025 --> 01:33:15,756
They first told me to elope with
the girl and then they are...

706
01:33:15,829 --> 01:33:20,198
...fighting with me.- Till you
elope, how can you get married?

707
01:33:20,266 --> 01:33:24,032
After eloping with the girl, what
is the need for marriage.

708
01:33:26,172 --> 01:33:30,768
That is our tradition -But why
are you entangling me in that?

709
01:33:31,911 --> 01:33:35,677
This bag is very beautiful.
Let me see it - No

710
01:33:36,216 --> 01:33:40,915
I'm refusing now. Is this any
marriage? This is a fight.

711
01:33:40,987 --> 01:33:45,515
I won't run now- What happens in
marriages in your caste then?

712
01:33:45,692 --> 01:33:51,460
In our caste... -Let us show
them - It will be helpful.

713
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:04,068
I am a beauty who shows love
and takes away the heart.

714
01:35:05,104 --> 01:35:09,234
My one glance can
make any man flat.

715
01:35:56,756 --> 01:36:00,817
Beware of me, one with hearts,
as I am a danger.

716
01:36:00,893 --> 01:36:05,057
With a smile, I can snatch away
anything with my style.

717
01:36:21,881 --> 01:36:25,578
I can have anyone in
a moment.

718
01:36:25,652 --> 01:36:30,021
With one glance, l
can make any man flat.

719
01:37:18,104 --> 01:37:22,097
I am brighter than the moon...
I am like the fire.

720
01:37:22,175 --> 01:37:24,973
Play with my heart considering
me as a flower...

721
01:37:25,044 --> 01:37:26,705
..but I am a romantic
butterfly.

722
01:37:42,762 --> 01:37:46,926
This assembly has become
colourful due to me.

723
01:37:47,700 --> 01:37:51,796
My one glance,
can make any man flat

724
01:39:17,824 --> 01:39:22,591
So only you people have come. Is
Veera ashamed to come in front.

725
01:39:23,196 --> 01:39:26,723
Return the purse.
-Put the guns down.

726
01:39:48,788 --> 01:39:49,846
That letter is not in this bag.

727
01:39:50,456 --> 01:39:56,827
Hey girl! - Leave it, that bag is
not of any use to us now.

728
01:40:01,567 --> 01:40:04,661
Chauhan..-Yes...- All these
photographs have been taken...

729
01:40:04,737 --> 01:40:07,137
...from front. Which photographer
was called for police club dance?

730
01:40:07,740 --> 01:40:11,870
Puri Studio...- Tell him to send
all the photos of Kiran tomorrow

731
01:40:12,745 --> 01:40:14,474
Particularly the profile and the
back poses which can help us...

732
01:40:14,547 --> 01:40:16,481
... to find the truth about her
hair-style.

733
01:40:22,655 --> 01:40:27,354
Master, I can't bear to see
Mowa's admiration for you.

734
01:40:27,960 --> 01:40:32,397
What are you blabbering? - That
day you killed the tiger.

735
01:40:32,632 --> 01:40:35,829
From now on I will hunt it.
Just give me some bullets.

736
01:40:36,002 --> 01:40:39,096
How will you use the bullets?
-I have a pistol.

737
01:40:39,639 --> 01:40:40,628
What is this?

738
01:40:43,743 --> 01:40:48,043
This is one of Naresh's pistol.
Where did you get it?

739
01:40:48,748 --> 01:40:51,114
Tell me where you got it?
-I got it in a tree

740
01:40:51,918 --> 01:40:53,078
Tell the truth fast or I will
break your face

741
01:40:53,586 --> 01:40:56,419
There is a jungle nearby, and a
tree there which has a hole...

742
01:40:56,489 --> 01:40:58,719
...in which I found this pistol.
Have'nt I told you fast?

743
01:40:59,158 --> 01:41:00,489
Ok, come and show the tree.

744
01:41:02,762 --> 01:41:08,997
So the commissioner has taken
away all his daughter's photos

745
01:41:09,902 --> 01:41:11,870
He gave a big amount and also
took the negatives - Is it?

746
01:41:12,605 --> 01:41:17,599
Why not? He has been our
teacher.

747
01:41:19,779 --> 01:41:23,647
Listen, find out about the man
who was dancing with Kiran...

748
01:41:23,716 --> 01:41:25,445
...on that night.
-Ok.

749
01:41:28,421 --> 01:41:32,118
This is wonderful. This proves
that Veera only killed Naresh.

750
01:41:32,758 --> 01:41:36,694
The whole doubt is on her now.
This should go to lnspector Rai.

751
01:41:37,597 --> 01:41:40,464
Please send this bag also
to lnspector Rai as this...

752
01:41:40,533 --> 01:41:42,899
...Ietter was inside this bag.

753
01:41:45,004 --> 01:41:48,838
Do you recogniZe this bag?
-No...

754
01:41:49,942 --> 01:41:53,139
This bag was found by a
tribal girl near my house...

755
01:41:53,212 --> 01:41:57,205
...where the jeep accident took
place. That day, Veera must...

756
01:41:57,450 --> 01:42:00,010
...have searched my house
for this bag only so that...

757
01:42:00,086 --> 01:42:02,452
...she will get this letter
-lt is possible.

758
01:42:03,155 --> 01:42:07,455
Veera is very clever. I doubt that
she only gave your letter to Rai.

759
01:42:09,729 --> 01:42:14,132
Did she give it. Was'nt the envelope
found when Naresh's house was..

760
01:42:14,200 --> 01:42:18,899
...searched.- No, I was present
then and no envelope was found

761
01:42:19,772 --> 01:42:22,832
Except Veera, noone is there,
who could give this to lnspector.

762
01:42:24,577 --> 01:42:30,538
I understood. She wanted to
divert the doubts towards us.

763
01:42:31,083 --> 01:42:34,951
Now there will be more doubts,
when Veera will tell the...

764
01:42:35,021 --> 01:42:37,717
...truth about whose purse
this is.

765
01:42:43,129 --> 01:42:45,063
You are smoking cigars again
in your worry.

766
01:42:45,831 --> 01:42:49,790
You know very well that this
bag belongs to Kiran.

767
01:42:50,503 --> 01:42:55,736
Trust me. I've told you before
also that I will save Kiran...

768
01:42:55,808 --> 01:42:58,606
...from every difficulty. Tell me
the truth about that night.

769
01:43:04,450 --> 01:43:05,610
Then listen...

770
01:43:06,585 --> 01:43:12,114
Ms. Kiran danced with me only
once. I can never forget it in life

771
01:43:18,631 --> 01:43:24,069
Was there a red rose in her
hair? - That is a minor matter

772
01:43:24,704 --> 01:43:32,634
Ask me something else.
Ask for her lipstick shade or...

773
01:43:32,712 --> 01:43:37,809
...her perfume which is still
lingering in my breath.

774
01:43:38,851 --> 01:43:44,756
I can even tell her body
temperature...98.4

775
01:43:46,592 --> 01:43:50,619
Was there a red rose in her
hair or not? - Yes...

776
01:43:55,634 --> 01:43:59,798
This is the matter. If lnspector
Rai comes to know of this...

777
01:43:59,872 --> 01:44:02,773
...he will immediately come with
a warrant- That is my fear.

778
01:44:03,576 --> 01:44:06,568
Rai doubts that Kiran is
Vimala's niece.

779
01:44:09,115 --> 01:44:12,482
Rai may find some other
evidence. We have to find...

780
01:44:12,551 --> 01:44:13,210
...the real killer as soon as
possible.

781
01:44:14,253 --> 01:44:20,249
Are you sure that Kiran is
not guilty? - I am sure.

782
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:25,021
Kiran will give proof of her
innocence today only

783
01:44:25,898 --> 01:44:27,126
I have told the plan to the
tribals.

784
01:44:32,404 --> 01:44:34,201
You stopped talking as soon as
you saw me.

785
01:44:35,007 --> 01:44:40,070
Is this something, I should not
know. - Nothing like that, Kiran

786
01:44:40,846 --> 01:44:43,041
There is something which
is being hidden.

787
01:44:44,683 --> 01:44:45,980
I was abusing you.

788
01:44:47,620 --> 01:44:50,851
I have to go a long way for
reaching my goal and hence...

789
01:44:50,923 --> 01:44:55,553
...there may be a delay in
bringing Kiran- That is ok.

790
01:44:56,495 --> 01:44:58,463
Go, daughter
-Thank you, sir

791
01:45:32,898 --> 01:45:37,460
Nagraj, get the wealth fast as
there is itching in my hands.

792
01:45:38,137 --> 01:45:43,598
Is'nt your neck itching? U won't
get wealth but handcuffs soon.

793
01:45:44,043 --> 01:45:50,471
Why? Was there any problem?
-lt will occur, as a religious...

794
01:45:50,549 --> 01:45:53,109
...man like me also drowns with
you. What'll the people say...

795
01:45:53,185 --> 01:45:56,518
...about my name Satyamurthy
and Satyakirthy?

796
01:45:57,156 --> 01:46:01,024
Say clearly, old man. What
happened? - Go away

797
01:46:01,827 --> 01:46:05,194
I have also got stuck by giving
your forged will in the Court

798
01:46:06,065 --> 01:46:11,697
I can't even take it back. Ajay
knows that it was a false will

799
01:46:12,471 --> 01:46:16,737
He said, he will take care
of me in the big Court.

800
01:46:17,209 --> 01:46:21,043
Don't fear. We won't lose
the game we are winning.

801
01:46:23,916 --> 01:46:26,646
Before he takes you on,
I will kill him.

802
01:47:21,206 --> 01:47:24,733
From the time, I met
you...

803
01:47:24,810 --> 01:47:28,803
...there is current in
every nerve of mine.

804
01:47:29,648 --> 01:47:32,811
Come on, my dear...

805
01:47:32,885 --> 01:47:35,820
...as I can't control my
youth.

806
01:48:44,823 --> 01:48:48,486
Both my eyes have
become like roses...

807
01:48:48,560 --> 01:48:52,496
...and I walk as if
I am a drunkard.

808
01:49:01,073 --> 01:49:04,702
How do I reveal the
secrets of my heart?

809
01:49:08,814 --> 01:49:12,215
Read my face like
a book.

810
01:50:00,899 --> 01:50:04,960
I have mingled in
your colours.

811
01:50:05,037 --> 01:50:08,666
I have understood the
words of love.

812
01:50:17,449 --> 01:50:20,907
You also understand,
my love

813
01:50:25,124 --> 01:50:28,958
Why I have dressed up
so well today?

814
01:51:16,475 --> 01:51:20,707
The path is new and
I am scared

815
01:51:20,779 --> 01:51:24,806
Come in front
and hold my hands.

816
01:51:33,225 --> 01:51:37,059
I should not lose myself
in your search.

817
01:51:40,966 --> 01:51:44,993
If I get you, my destiny
will awaken.

818
01:52:38,190 --> 01:52:39,782
What happened? Why
did she faint?

819
01:52:40,592 --> 01:52:42,025
Get water fast.
- I have understood.

820
01:52:46,598 --> 01:52:49,192
Take these shoes, Master.
-Shall I hit your head with them

821
01:52:49,701 --> 01:52:50,190
No, make her smell it. She will
immediately come to her senses

822
01:52:50,769 --> 01:52:52,134
You just get lost from here.

823
01:52:56,108 --> 01:53:00,704
Kiran, what happened?
How are you?

824
01:53:02,614 --> 01:53:05,708
I fell as if in my brains...
-As if...

825
01:53:06,184 --> 01:53:09,984
Some things are coming to my
mind but stopping somehow.

826
01:53:11,223 --> 01:53:12,190
Come with me.

827
01:53:16,628 --> 01:53:18,027
You go and change clothes
in the hut.

828
01:53:21,900 --> 01:53:25,165
You continue your work,
after I go. Understood..-Yes

829
01:53:27,706 --> 01:53:28,434
What is the work?

830
01:54:00,439 --> 01:54:04,068
Where did you bring me?
-This is Timli Estate's house

831
01:54:05,077 --> 01:54:06,669
You rest for sometime here.
I will just bring the jeep - No...

832
01:54:07,512 --> 01:54:12,779
I am feeling scared. - But there
is no danger here.

833
01:54:13,151 --> 01:54:14,709
I will be back in
10-15 minutes.

834
01:55:38,503 --> 01:55:43,668
No...Don't come near me, Naresh
-lt is me, Kiran

835
01:55:44,543 --> 01:55:47,876
Leave me, I won't marry you.
-What happened, Kiran?

836
01:55:53,118 --> 01:55:55,643
Come to your senses.

837
01:55:56,221 --> 01:55:59,679
I had to do this deliberately to
bring back your memory.

838
01:55:59,758 --> 01:56:03,854
Your father told me only today
that you have lapses in memory

839
01:56:04,529 --> 01:56:07,157
Sometimes, such dangerous
mishaps occur in a man's life...

840
01:56:07,232 --> 01:56:13,501
...that he forgets that mishap &
also the people connected to it.

841
01:56:14,940 --> 01:56:17,568
Please try to remember what
happened before jeep accident...

842
01:56:17,642 --> 01:56:20,611
...that night. Tell me...
Just now you took Naresh's name

843
01:56:21,246 --> 01:56:25,910
You definitely knew Naresh.
Your father thinks that you...

844
01:56:25,984 --> 01:56:31,752
...can live peacefully only if you
forget Naresh's mishap.

845
01:56:32,524 --> 01:56:37,655
That is why he never mentioned
this to you and kept saving you

846
01:56:42,634 --> 01:56:46,798
Now your dad also can't save
you. Police doubt that you only...

847
01:56:46,872 --> 01:56:52,777
...killed Naresh. - Me...
-To prove yourself innocent...

848
01:56:52,844 --> 01:56:55,677
...you have to remember that
mishap. Put some pressure on...

849
01:56:55,747 --> 01:57:01,743
...your brain and try to remember
it. What happened that night?

850
01:57:59,044 --> 01:58:00,409
Naresh has not come yet

851
01:58:01,012 --> 01:58:03,139
He would not have got leisure
from his pleasures.

852
01:58:05,884 --> 01:58:09,843
You should not blame anyone
unnecessarily.

853
01:58:10,722 --> 01:58:13,953
You have just met him
before some weeks.

854
01:58:14,826 --> 01:58:17,226
What do you know about him?
-He is absolutely characterless.

855
01:58:17,963 --> 01:58:22,491
Only today one girl called up and
told me-Must've said in jealousy

856
01:58:23,535 --> 01:58:26,902
Naresh is a very rich man. Many
girls want to marry him

857
01:58:28,640 --> 01:58:32,736
When some girl must have come
to know that he is becoming...

858
01:58:32,811 --> 01:58:38,875
...my son-in-law...- What?
-Yes daughter, yesterday l...

859
01:58:38,950 --> 01:58:40,781
...have promised to him.
-Without asking me...

860
01:58:41,686 --> 01:58:44,154
I will surely find out the truth
about him today & right now.

861
01:59:26,898 --> 01:59:29,833
Naresh, you had promised that
you will marry me.

862
01:59:30,568 --> 01:59:32,968
Now I understand that those
promises were for fulfilling...

863
01:59:33,038 --> 01:59:35,472
...your lust. I have read
Commissioner Sharma's letter.

864
01:59:36,141 --> 01:59:39,702
You are becoming his son-in-law
& going to the Police party today

865
01:59:40,478 --> 01:59:44,676
I will also come there to take
revenge for your cheating.

866
02:00:18,450 --> 02:00:24,980
Kiran, you here...
...at such late night.

867
02:00:25,990 --> 02:00:30,893
Who was that girl?
-I don't know her well myself

868
02:00:31,463 --> 02:00:34,489
I met her in the party. She said
that she is staying in the...

869
02:00:34,566 --> 02:00:37,763
...nearby estate for some days.
I took lift from her.

870
02:00:38,570 --> 02:00:41,471
She also gave her hankie to you
for wiping her lipstick in Ur face

871
02:00:42,107 --> 02:00:45,838
You doubt unnecessarily, Kiran.
I love only you.

872
02:00:46,978 --> 02:00:49,469
Your dad has also accepted
for our marriage.

873
02:00:50,081 --> 02:00:53,141
That is why I came here. If he
also sees proof of your...

874
02:00:53,384 --> 02:00:54,851
...Ioose character, it will be
good. - What proof?

875
02:00:55,587 --> 02:00:57,714
The letter in your bedroom.
I will take it with me.

876
02:01:07,899 --> 02:01:13,735
Tonight, you take a sweet
experience with you.

877
02:01:14,539 --> 02:01:17,838
Such an experience, which will
compel you to marry only me.

878
02:01:18,977 --> 02:01:22,538
Don't come ahead -Let me see,
how you refuse to marry me...

879
02:01:22,614 --> 02:01:23,512
...after that experience.
-No, Naresh...

880
02:01:28,119 --> 02:01:32,988
Whichever girl I have desired for
till today, I have surely got her.

881
02:01:36,761 --> 02:01:41,198
This much anger... I have been
searching for a girl like you...

882
02:01:41,432 --> 02:01:43,866
...for ages. Now I will surely
marry you.

883
02:01:44,502 --> 02:01:46,163
Leave me. I will never
marry you...

884
02:01:46,638 --> 02:01:53,635
Leave me, I say
-I am your lover.

885
02:02:01,186 --> 02:02:02,813
Don't come ahead or else
I will shoot you.

886
02:02:03,254 --> 02:02:05,119
Your hands are shivering and
you can't shoot.

887
02:02:07,892 --> 02:02:09,587
If you are more stubborn, you
will lose your life.

888
02:02:28,646 --> 02:02:36,143
I was under compulsion and l
shot Naresh & he got killed

889
02:02:36,955 --> 02:02:43,451
I never thought that these hands
will be filled with blood.

890
02:02:43,928 --> 02:02:47,796
What are you saying, Kiran?
I thought that when your...

891
02:02:47,866 --> 02:02:51,802
...memory comes back, I will find
proof of your innocence.

892
02:02:52,570 --> 02:02:58,839
But something else has happened.
-I just wish that you should...

893
02:02:58,910 --> 02:03:05,145
...not hate me. God knows what
law will decide for me.

894
02:03:06,150 --> 02:03:11,213
But if I have your support, I will
hang also with a smile.

895
02:03:11,723 --> 02:03:15,887
Kiran, I am with you and will
save you from every difficulty.

896
02:04:30,768 --> 02:04:33,862
Where have these two vanished?
Search the whole jungle.

897
02:04:40,545 --> 02:04:43,639
What happened? - It is me...
I heard gunshots and...

898
02:04:43,715 --> 02:04:46,149
...told Mowa that we will go
and investigate.

899
02:04:47,051 --> 02:04:49,781
Kiran, write a letter fast.

900
02:05:05,903 --> 02:05:07,928
Robby, I think that those two
have gone somewhere else.

901
02:05:08,873 --> 02:05:11,706
Both of you go to the roads
fast. He might go to the city...

902
02:05:11,776 --> 02:05:15,576
...by jeep. He should not escape
alive. You two come with me.

903
02:05:16,180 --> 02:05:17,044
We will see in his house.

904
02:05:20,118 --> 02:05:22,882
Did you understand, Mowa.
Nobody should come to know.

905
02:05:22,954 --> 02:05:27,448
Or else my whole plan will be
spoiled and send a trusted...

906
02:05:27,525 --> 02:05:30,983
...man to call the police.
Reach this letter to Veera...

907
02:05:31,062 --> 02:05:33,553
...tonight only. - I can go to
the city somehow in a horse

908
02:05:33,631 --> 02:05:36,862
But how will I know madam's
house. -Teju is there to help you

909
02:05:36,934 --> 02:05:41,030
No, she will help me. I will ride
the horse as I am the man

910
02:05:42,106 --> 02:05:44,404
If all work is left to you, there
will be confusions

911
02:05:44,976 --> 02:05:46,944
Come and meet me at the 4th
block, understand...

912
02:05:47,678 --> 02:05:49,407
Yes, the one next to 3rd.
-Yes... Come

913
02:06:19,110 --> 02:06:22,477
Veera, the letter you wrote to
Naresh is with me. From that...

914
02:06:22,547 --> 02:06:27,450
...you can also be a suspect for
murder. Police suspect me also

915
02:06:28,052 --> 02:06:30,452
We must support each other
in such a situation.

916
02:06:31,055 --> 02:06:35,515
Meet me in the 4th block at
12:30 today noon near the river

917
02:06:42,100 --> 02:06:43,795
The bullets in the pistol are
over.

918
02:06:44,602 --> 02:06:47,435
Still you want to spend the night
in the jungle.

919
02:06:48,106 --> 02:06:52,008
Your life is in danger here. Why
can't we go to the Police Station?

920
02:06:52,643 --> 02:06:56,477
You don't know that they have
blocked all roads to the city...

921
02:06:56,547 --> 02:06:59,038
...and also my house. - Then let
us go to Mowa's place.

922
02:06:59,750 --> 02:07:01,809
I have taken as much help as l
could from the Tribals.

923
02:07:01,886 --> 02:07:04,548
I don't want the secrets to be
spread to many as my plan may...

924
02:07:04,622 --> 02:07:10,754
...not succeed then. -For my sake,
you are playing with your life

925
02:07:11,429 --> 02:07:16,833
You can't save me. Trust me.
I am the killer, Ajay

926
02:07:17,568 --> 02:07:22,972
You are innocent. Just think, why
was Robby shooting at us.

927
02:07:23,608 --> 02:07:27,135
He knows that I got some proof.
Either Robby is the killer...

928
02:07:27,378 --> 02:07:28,777
...or he is with the killer.

929
02:07:29,981 --> 02:07:32,745
Listen, I have come to take
my passport.

930
02:07:33,417 --> 02:07:34,941
I can't give it without the
lnspector's consent.

931
02:07:35,686 --> 02:07:38,951
Can I meet him?- He has gone to
Timli forest estate and...

932
02:07:39,023 --> 02:07:42,720
...he will come late.
-Why has he gone there?

933
02:07:43,461 --> 02:07:45,929
Not for roaming. He is a police
man and has gone for arresting.

934
02:08:38,115 --> 02:08:38,740
Throw the stone.

935
02:08:44,488 --> 02:08:47,514
If you value your life, tell these
people to put down their guns

936
02:08:48,125 --> 02:08:50,025
Tell them...
-Throw the guns

937
02:09:05,810 --> 02:09:08,142
Take the revolver with you
as it is empty.

938
02:09:08,212 --> 02:09:13,514
He has taken my revolver which
is also empty-Pounce on him.

939
02:12:49,233 --> 02:12:52,225
I am sorry, I have brought
warrant to arrest Ms. Kiran

940
02:13:25,135 --> 02:13:27,467
Tiger is nearby. How are you
here?

941
02:13:27,571 --> 02:13:28,697
Kiran had written a letter
and called me at this place.

942
02:13:29,139 --> 02:13:33,769
Police have arrested her.
Let us run away from here

943
02:13:36,413 --> 02:13:38,904
Did you have to come at this
moment only? Let us go back.

944
02:13:41,585 --> 02:13:45,749
Tiger is here only - What should
we do now? -There it is

945
02:13:47,892 --> 02:13:49,223
I don't even have a revolver with
me now.

946
02:13:49,927 --> 02:13:53,454
That day I hid the revolver here
only - Where?

947
02:13:54,098 --> 02:13:55,497
Maybe in that tree...
Come...

948
02:14:08,846 --> 02:14:12,247
Sir, he has got a pistol.
He should not shoot really.

949
02:14:12,917 --> 02:14:17,013
Save me. I am a man and not a
tiger.-Come my tiger.

950
02:14:24,929 --> 02:14:28,194
Inspector, this is Naresh's pistol
which was hidden here after...

951
02:14:28,432 --> 02:14:32,528
...the murder. The ones who hid
it, have taken it out today.

952
02:14:33,203 --> 02:14:36,661
Veera, I have to arrest all three
of you for investigation.

953
02:14:37,575 --> 02:14:40,772
Why me? Ask both of them.
I had no hand in the murder.

954
02:14:41,579 --> 02:14:45,743
You had shot me with these
hands and made a false will.

955
02:14:46,650 --> 02:14:46,945
Put the handcuffs on him.

956
02:14:51,956 --> 02:14:55,756
Move away. Ajay, you have
spoiled all my plans.

957
02:14:56,594 --> 02:14:57,891
I won't leave you alive.

958
02:14:58,562 --> 02:15:07,197
Don't kill him. He is my son.
-Your son..

959
02:15:07,871 --> 02:15:14,970
And Veera is my niece.-Please
take her to the hospital

960
02:15:15,045 --> 02:15:18,503
No, let me give my evidence
first.

961
02:15:21,151 --> 02:15:24,746
Inspector, Veera is the niece
whom I have brought up like...

962
02:15:24,822 --> 02:15:27,620
....my daughter from childhood.

963
02:15:31,428 --> 02:15:36,422
When Naresh came back to lndia,
she also came behind him.

964
02:15:37,901 --> 02:15:42,167
I learnt before some months that
he was playing with her life.

965
02:15:44,642 --> 02:15:45,040
Then what happened?

966
02:15:47,911 --> 02:15:51,108
When I called her at her house
on the evening of the murder...

967
02:15:51,181 --> 02:15:54,981
...she told me that Naresh was
coming to her house and...

968
02:15:55,052 --> 02:16:00,422
...said she will settle matters
with him on that night.

969
02:16:01,191 --> 02:16:06,458
When I reached her flat, she
had already left with Naresh.

970
02:16:09,833 --> 02:16:13,963
I went to Naresh's house
in a taxi. Nobody was there.

971
02:16:15,939 --> 02:16:23,607
I waited for him in a chair
in the balcony & doZed off

972
02:16:31,655 --> 02:16:35,716
Today not me, but you will
lose your life.

973
02:16:54,978 --> 02:16:59,847
Aunty, what have you done?
-ln the darkness, I thought..

974
02:16:59,917 --> 02:17:02,681
...that he was playing with your
life. Who was that girl?

975
02:17:03,787 --> 02:17:05,812
Whoever it was, give the pistol
and go out now.

976
02:17:06,724 --> 02:17:08,988
We will meet outside after some
time. Now you go.

977
02:17:14,131 --> 02:17:23,733
Veera, you shot at me. You won't
escape now.

978
02:17:25,109 --> 02:17:33,710
Kiran has taken your letter in
her bag. Police will suspect you.

979
02:17:38,021 --> 02:17:43,482
I told you so many times that
I only killed him but nobody...

980
02:17:43,560 --> 02:17:54,698
...believed me. Veera lied only to
save me. She is innocent.

981
02:18:07,017 --> 02:18:11,716
Law might forgive but
Lord... - Aunty...

982
02:18:23,200 --> 02:18:27,694
If God had to prove me innocent,
why did he take her life.

983
02:18:36,613 --> 02:18:39,707
Rai, this is the second pistol
which I had taken after murder

984
02:18:41,885 --> 02:18:46,948
In 35 years service, I have seen
for the first time that the...

985
02:18:47,024 --> 02:18:51,688
...murderer surrendered and
nobody believed her.

986
02:18:54,164 --> 02:19:01,798
I am becoming restless
in your love

987
02:19:02,673 --> 02:19:09,044
I went to hunt but
got hunted instead.
