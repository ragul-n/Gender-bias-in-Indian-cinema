1
00:02:32,804 --> 00:02:35,773
Buddy, take this milk. And
drink it in one breath.

2
00:02:36,241 --> 00:02:38,937
What? - Take it. First drink
it then we'll talk.

3
00:02:39,244 --> 00:02:43,271
If you don't have the strength
then how will you talk? Drink!

4
00:02:49,854 --> 00:02:52,880
Good boy! You seem to be belonging
to a rich family.

5
00:02:53,591 --> 00:02:57,220
How did I come to know? You
are starving to death.

6
00:02:57,795 --> 00:02:58,887
But your style of drinking
milk is like those...

7
00:02:58,997 --> 00:03:00,225
...of rich people didn't change.

8
00:03:00,732 --> 00:03:04,566
Actually... - Yes, say, say.
How educated are you?

9
00:03:05,937 --> 00:03:08,735
MSc first class.
- MSc. Where have you come from?

10
00:03:10,642 --> 00:03:12,576
Punjab. - Thank God you
didn't say that you...

11
00:03:12,677 --> 00:03:14,838
...have fallen from the sky.

12
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,478
I can read from your face that
you have come from Punjab.

13
00:03:19,284 --> 00:03:23,584
I am not asking your caste. Tell
me where have you come from?

14
00:03:24,355 --> 00:03:26,380
Which city or village do you belong?

15
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:33,257
Village? - Ok. Don't tell
if you don't want to.

16
00:03:34,365 --> 00:03:36,265
But at least let me know
why have you come here?

17
00:03:37,302 --> 00:03:42,604
To die. - To die. Here. Ok,
that means your soul...

18
00:03:42,707 --> 00:03:47,269
...had already told you that
it won't leave your body.

19
00:03:47,378 --> 00:03:50,279
Until you have traveled miles. No.

20
00:03:52,016 --> 00:03:54,746
I came here to die so that no
body could identify my body.

21
00:03:56,554 --> 00:04:00,888
But when I came here I saw
new faces, new places.

22
00:04:02,026 --> 00:04:06,292
Though the city is new to
me I felt familiar to it.

23
00:04:07,332 --> 00:04:08,356
So I thought that I'll live
for some more days.

24
00:04:10,535 --> 00:04:11,559
Therefore I want to
search for a job.

25
00:04:12,937 --> 00:04:13,961
And ultimately I spent
all my money doing so.

26
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:18,935
And started starving to death.
Thus facing death again.

27
00:04:20,645 --> 00:04:24,308
Listen, if you want to die then
have a glass of milk first.

28
00:04:26,451 --> 00:04:29,909
This is just not your sad story
but everyone has the same story.

29
00:04:30,621 --> 00:04:33,385
Look at me. I too am educated
and hold a degree too.

30
00:04:33,591 --> 00:04:36,321
But could not find a job.
I ran after the job.

31
00:04:36,694 --> 00:04:40,061
And poverty ran after me.
And I landed up here.

32
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:45,726
At last fortunately
I found a great job.

33
00:04:47,105 --> 00:04:53,066
A peon's job. So I took it. And
since I am health conscious.

34
00:04:53,578 --> 00:04:57,070
So I eat only once a day.
And that also not 'ldli'.

35
00:04:57,715 --> 00:05:00,411
I eat according to my size that
is bread. Only if I get it.

36
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:04,852
See my physique. Don't
I look like a wrestler?

37
00:05:10,528 --> 00:05:12,621
Ok, I'll take a leave.
- But where will you go?

38
00:05:14,599 --> 00:05:20,037
Do you have any place to live? - 
No, but I don't want to be a burden.

39
00:05:20,638 --> 00:05:24,438
Burden! Yes, some people
are burden on others.

40
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:27,373
But my biggest burden
is my loneliness.

41
00:05:29,781 --> 00:05:31,840
Why don't you stay
with me my friend?

42
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:36,712
But as it is you are struggling
to survive yourself.

43
00:05:37,522 --> 00:05:38,716
So we shall together
struggle to survive.

44
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:46,530
But you often stay hungry.
- So you share my hunger.

45
00:05:51,936 --> 00:05:56,464
Ok. - Ok. I have to go to the
office I'll see you in the evening.

46
00:06:00,445 --> 00:06:04,142
But don't go anywhere. You have
given death one chance.

47
00:06:04,849 --> 00:06:06,407
Now give life one chance.

48
00:06:16,461 --> 00:06:20,090
Ram, keep this file on boss's desk.
- On bosses desk.

49
00:06:23,134 --> 00:06:25,568
Good morning Sir.
- How are you Ram? - Fine.

50
00:06:36,581 --> 00:06:37,843
You seem to be happy today
Ram. What's the matter?

51
00:06:38,616 --> 00:06:41,141
Sir, I have found a friend
in this foreign city.

52
00:06:42,086 --> 00:06:48,958
That's good. - Sir, just a minute
I want to talk to you.

53
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:55,192
Yes, say. - You guys have no
other work besides playing?

54
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:08,736
You thought I've left? - No, I thought
that I'll be lonely once again.

55
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,980
I had just gone for a walk.
- Come let's go in.

56
00:07:14,151 --> 00:07:16,483
Is this your name?
- Yes, it is. Why?

57
00:07:16,854 --> 00:07:18,481
Nothing, my name is also the same.
- What?

58
00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:21,188
My name is Ram Chandra.
- My name is Ravi Chandra.

59
00:07:21,993 --> 00:07:23,858
Oh yes! Let's shake hands
on this occasion.

60
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:30,497
Oh! This...

61
00:07:57,562 --> 00:08:01,521
What's the matter?
- Nothing it's my father's letter.

62
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:04,527
He writes that my mother
is ill and needs...

63
00:08:04,635 --> 00:08:07,263
...to be admitted in hospital. And
therefore he needs 1000 rupees.

64
00:08:08,573 --> 00:08:12,532
1000 rupees! Where will
it come from? - Nowhere.

65
00:08:13,878 --> 00:08:16,608
What will you do?
- I did what I could do.

66
00:08:17,582 --> 00:08:21,746
I can't send the money. Tears
were falling from my eyes.

67
00:08:23,254 --> 00:08:24,278
So I let it fall silently.

68
00:08:27,925 --> 00:08:30,553
Greetings! - Greetings!
- Greetings! - Greetings!

69
00:08:31,796 --> 00:08:39,567
Thank you for your favor.
- Meet him he is Nagapa.

70
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:42,571
He is a clerk in our office.
And a very useful man.

71
00:08:42,673 --> 00:08:43,697
He also speaks a little bit Hindi.

72
00:08:44,108 --> 00:08:46,576
So Nagapa, how come you are here?

73
00:08:46,677 --> 00:08:49,578
Big people don't visit the poor
people without a reason.

74
00:08:50,047 --> 00:08:53,915
I have an urgent work.
- Yes, say. - It's private.

75
00:08:55,786 --> 00:09:00,917
See Nagapa, none of my secrets
are hidden from this friend.

76
00:09:01,826 --> 00:09:07,594
Great! Great! See Ram
you had sent 2...

77
00:09:07,698 --> 00:09:13,603
...applications for a job with 2
different name. - Yes, very correct.

78
00:09:14,271 --> 00:09:18,935
So Ravi, the second
application for the...

79
00:09:19,043 --> 00:09:24,276
...manager's post has been
approved by bigger manager.

80
00:09:24,649 --> 00:09:25,946
And today he told me
to post it to you.

81
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:29,952
So I thought what to post I'll
hand it to you personally.

82
00:09:30,187 --> 00:09:31,211
Give me, give me.

83
00:09:36,661 --> 00:09:40,620
What type writing?

84
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:47,338
Each alphabet shines like your
teeth. - Thank you, thank you.

85
00:09:47,672 --> 00:09:51,108
But your first job is as the peon.

86
00:09:52,376 --> 00:09:55,368
So what do you think
about the second job?

87
00:09:56,781 --> 00:09:58,271
So what do you think
about the second job?

88
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:02,184
That is what I have come here for.
- I didn't understand.

89
00:10:03,087 --> 00:10:07,023
See my son is BA passed.
But unemployed.

90
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:09,993
Ok so to be unemployed one
should be BA passed?

91
00:10:10,094 --> 00:10:14,997
So if in any condition he
gets this job then. - Then!

92
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,267
We'll give you 3000 rupees from.

93
00:10:22,206 --> 00:10:24,140
You mean bribe.
- Nagapa you sit we'll just come.

94
00:10:27,912 --> 00:10:30,073
Ram brother you should agree
to Nagapa's proposal.

95
00:10:30,715 --> 00:10:32,808
Why? Because he is offering
3000 rupees. - Yes.

96
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:34,913
And for that 3000 rupees I
should sell my home? - Yes.

97
00:10:35,152 --> 00:10:37,746
Have you gone mad? What do you
know the value of my home?

98
00:10:45,196 --> 00:10:47,164
Your name is Ravi right?
- Yes, Ravi Chandra.

99
00:10:47,965 --> 00:10:53,961
Then this job is yours from
tomorrow. - How come mine?

100
00:10:54,805 --> 00:10:57,865
R. Chandra. That can be Rvai
Chandra also. - But...

101
00:10:58,075 --> 00:11:04,947
Shut up this is life.
- Ram, what have you decided?

102
00:11:05,983 --> 00:11:08,918
Nagapa I'll tell
you in a day or 2.

103
00:11:11,222 --> 00:11:17,218
Ravi 2 days are too long.
What if something goes wrong?

104
00:11:18,229 --> 00:11:20,390
Nagapa, I told you that I'll
tell you in one or two, right?

105
00:11:20,498 --> 00:11:27,427
Now go. - Greetings! - Greetings!
Ravi, - Go.

106
00:11:28,405 --> 00:11:29,963
Ram brother, I am telling
you once again.

107
00:11:30,307 --> 00:11:31,365
Agree with what Nagapa proposes.

108
00:11:32,076 --> 00:11:33,407
That take the money from Nagapa
and send the money to your home.

109
00:11:33,778 --> 00:11:36,406
Why are you upsetting me?
You don't know my father.

110
00:11:37,214 --> 00:11:40,342
You can never say whether
he is saying truth or lies.

111
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:46,078
See we have a property which
our relative stole from us.

112
00:11:47,024 --> 00:11:48,116
So we filed a case against them.

113
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:49,983
And that case is still going on.

114
00:11:51,362 --> 00:11:54,229
Now what ever money he receives
from truth or lies.

115
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:56,762
He spends it on the case.

116
00:12:05,543 --> 00:12:09,138
"My mother I have not
eaten the butter.

117
00:12:10,948 --> 00:12:15,078
My mother I have not
eaten the butter."

118
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,781
Lawyer Greetings! This
time I have written...

119
00:12:17,888 --> 00:12:19,788
...such a letter to my son.

120
00:12:20,057 --> 00:12:22,525
That he'll send the money
as soon as he reads it.

121
00:12:23,828 --> 00:12:25,796
And after that I'll pay
your complete fees.

122
00:12:28,566 --> 00:12:29,931
But when did I ask for money?

123
00:12:30,901 --> 00:12:34,337
Your son has just got a job. Where
will he get the money from?

124
00:12:35,172 --> 00:12:37,800
That's alright lawyer. But... but
tomorrow is the hearing, right?

125
00:12:38,175 --> 00:12:40,939
Yes.
- So we will win the case, right?

126
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,809
See Bolaki, our duty is to try.

127
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:48,885
Now victory or lost
lies in God's hands.

128
00:12:52,423 --> 00:12:59,829
Hello! Yes, Madhav say. What?
Ok, I am coming.

129
00:13:01,332 --> 00:13:07,134
"Hey beautiful girl, you
have stolen my heart."

130
00:13:07,872 --> 00:13:10,841
"Beautiful girl, amazing
things has happened.

131
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:14,837
"On the streets Bakke
has lost his heart."

132
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:22,451
"Hey beautiful girl, you
have stolen my heart."

133
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:26,018
"Beautiful girl, amazing
things has happened."

134
00:13:26,891 --> 00:13:29,860
"On the streets Bakke
has lost his heart."

135
00:13:51,482 --> 00:14:00,880
"I pick-pocketed someone
and got arrested."

136
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:05,892
"Abracadabra. I have been arrested."

137
00:14:06,563 --> 00:14:09,896
"But nobody asks her
who stole my heart...

138
00:14:10,134 --> 00:14:13,535
...and peace after she met me."

139
00:14:13,938 --> 00:14:17,032
"The beautiful girl stole my heart."

140
00:14:17,942 --> 00:14:23,471
"Hey beautiful girl, you
have stolen my heart."

141
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:27,250
"Beautiful girl, amazing
things has happened."

142
00:14:28,018 --> 00:14:30,919
"On the streets Bakke
has lost his heart."

143
00:14:44,501 --> 00:14:49,461
"She does the same work that we do."

144
00:14:50,274 --> 00:14:54,938
"If we are called thieves
then she too is a thief."

145
00:14:59,616 --> 00:15:02,949
"We steal money and
she steals heart."

146
00:15:03,053 --> 00:15:06,489
"If the beautiful girl agrees
then we shall steal together."

147
00:15:06,991 --> 00:15:10,085
"We both will make a great pair."

148
00:15:10,594 --> 00:15:16,464
"Hey beautiful girl, you
have stolen my heart."

149
00:15:17,101 --> 00:15:20,127
"Beautiful girl, amazing
things has happened.

150
00:15:21,071 --> 00:15:26,168
"On the streets Bakke has lost his
heart. Lost it. Lost it. Lost it."

151
00:15:27,011 --> 00:15:29,206
"Beautiful girl you have
stolen my heart."

152
00:15:34,752 --> 00:15:35,980
What a great song I have heard.

153
00:15:36,086 --> 00:15:39,522
It's the voice of the people.
What a melodious song?

154
00:15:39,623 --> 00:15:43,992
Shut up! - What happen?
- These jerks play this...

155
00:15:44,094 --> 00:15:48,588
...cacophonous orchestra and
you are praising them?

156
00:15:50,034 --> 00:15:54,061
Then what should be done? - I want
you to file a case against them.

157
00:15:54,605 --> 00:15:57,005
Yes, but on what matter?
- You talk as if...

158
00:15:57,107 --> 00:16:00,235
...you don't know anything.
- I know, I know.

159
00:16:00,778 --> 00:16:02,336
But do you have any evidence
against Bakke.

160
00:16:02,446 --> 00:16:04,539
Which I can produce in the court?

161
00:16:05,049 --> 00:16:07,677
You are the lawyer. It is your
job to find the evidence.

162
00:16:08,452 --> 00:16:10,477
Yes, I am the lawyer I'll have
to find the evidence myself.

163
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:17,022
Mahadev Prasad-ji, do you
have any of Bakke's...

164
00:16:17,127 --> 00:16:20,119
...love letter? - No. - Any foul
publicity in the papers?

165
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:22,698
No. - Any picture of him and
your daughter together?

166
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,429
What crap are you speaking?
I am not speaking any crap.

167
00:16:27,171 --> 00:16:30,265
What if the judge asks me
the same question tomorrow?

168
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:35,367
What will I answer him?
What will I answer him?

169
00:16:35,479 --> 00:16:38,243
Shut up Narian Prasad-ji,
I am upset over here.

170
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:40,383
And you are singing. Isn't
there any way by which...

171
00:16:40,484 --> 00:16:43,453
...this Bakke can be forced
to admit the truth?

172
00:16:44,154 --> 00:16:47,715
Yes, I can. But in the court I'll
have to question your daughter.

173
00:16:48,392 --> 00:16:52,158
That does she have a legal or
illegal relations with Bakke.

174
00:16:54,231 --> 00:16:57,064
Mahadev-ji, how can I
ask such questions...

175
00:16:57,167 --> 00:17:00,068
...to your daughter with whom I
have played in her childhood?

176
00:17:00,237 --> 00:17:04,731
Then I'll have to sit helpless
what else? Have faith in God.

177
00:17:06,343 --> 00:17:09,073
And tell your daughter not
to talk to strangers.

178
00:17:10,514 --> 00:17:11,538
If she doesn't understand
with harsh behaviour.

179
00:17:11,648 --> 00:17:13,741
Then try to explain to her with
love. She is still a kid.

180
00:17:13,851 --> 00:17:17,309
Yes, she is immature and so are you.

181
00:17:18,122 --> 00:17:22,582
And that jerk can go scoot
free who humiliates us.

182
00:17:24,128 --> 00:17:29,430
Great! Great! What have...

183
00:17:29,533 --> 00:17:35,699
...you brought this dude?

184
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,102
Sir, I thought it must
be gold so I stole it.

185
00:17:39,276 --> 00:17:41,301
I thought you would reward
me 2-4 rupees in turn.

186
00:17:41,411 --> 00:17:44,778
Ok then you keep it now get lost.

187
00:17:49,219 --> 00:17:51,585
Has everybody kept out
what they had stolen?

188
00:17:51,688 --> 00:17:54,122
Or should I check you all
individually? - No! - No! - No!

189
00:18:02,633 --> 00:18:04,328
Hey! Why are you shrugging
your shoulders?

190
00:18:05,269 --> 00:18:07,829
Master, actually I was beaten
up yesterday so it's paining.

191
00:18:08,372 --> 00:18:11,535
Oh yes! Let's see. What is this?

192
00:18:13,544 --> 00:18:17,776
Master I thought I will go
to Munni darling's dance.

193
00:18:18,182 --> 00:18:22,551
And gift her this wallet instead
of money. Shut up!

194
00:18:24,254 --> 00:18:30,489
Buddy, enjoy for the entire
month, enjoy, enjoy.

195
00:18:31,261 --> 00:18:35,664
Now let me ask the news
from my best friends.

196
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:40,296
Say, sir any achievements?
Any news about my Kusum?

197
00:18:41,205 --> 00:18:44,504
Yes master, a boy from Delhi
came to see your Kusum.

198
00:18:45,309 --> 00:18:46,640
Did you let him see?
- No, master.

199
00:18:46,877 --> 00:18:48,902
We didn't let him succeed.
- And how is that?

200
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:53,676
First we found out his name
and address. - Then?

201
00:18:54,351 --> 00:18:57,184
Then we wrote few letters to
his father. - What letters?

202
00:18:57,688 --> 00:18:59,656
That send him to see the girl.
- Jerk!

203
00:18:59,756 --> 00:19:04,523
And we wrote in the letter that
the girl is of a bad character.

204
00:19:05,362 --> 00:19:09,924
Great! Great! Who says that our
country needs educated man?

205
00:19:10,467 --> 00:19:12,332
Sir, we have sent a copy of
that letter to the boy also.

206
00:19:12,536 --> 00:19:15,869
Carbon copy.
- Sir, here you are. - Read.

207
00:19:19,243 --> 00:19:23,202
Dear brother greetings! There
are dozens of bachelor...

208
00:19:23,313 --> 00:19:27,374
...girls waiting to marry you.
Bachelor, beautiful and rich.

209
00:19:27,918 --> 00:19:30,944
Dude I feel like kissing
your pen. Read further.

210
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:34,216
So why are you coming
to see only one girl...

211
00:19:34,324 --> 00:19:36,622
...who is a bachelor
only for name sake?

212
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:39,886
Great! You have killed me.
Say one thing buddy.

213
00:19:40,264 --> 00:19:42,562
Were you a member of a
political party before?

214
00:19:42,933 --> 00:19:44,867
See hear what I have written
further. - Yes, read.

215
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:48,230
That girl is already having
an affair with someone.

216
00:19:48,739 --> 00:19:54,371
Who is handsome and young.
- You have killed me. Read further.

217
00:19:55,345 --> 00:19:59,247
Now you only decide since
you are educated.

218
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:05,378
Am I educated?
- Not you sir, that guy. - Oh!

219
00:20:05,522 --> 00:20:07,990
Let him be where he is and let
me be where I am. Read on.

220
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:10,927
Now you believe it or not
it's your wish. - Great!

221
00:20:11,361 --> 00:20:13,591
You see the difference
between you guys...

222
00:20:13,697 --> 00:20:15,756
...and these degree holders?
- What is the difference sir?

223
00:20:16,366 --> 00:20:20,598
If they are king of
pen then we too are...

224
00:20:20,704 --> 00:20:25,505
...kings in pick-pocketing. We
steal, we loot, we pick-pocket.

225
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:28,471
We get beaten. We go to the jail.

226
00:20:28,912 --> 00:20:32,541
But the pulp is yours and the skin
is ours... - Shut up! You imbecile!

227
00:20:33,317 --> 00:20:35,285
Do you whom you call a leader?

228
00:20:35,385 --> 00:20:38,286
Yes, one who takes all
the cream for himself.

229
00:20:38,388 --> 00:20:40,447
But how? Like a crow
by snatching it?

230
00:20:40,857 --> 00:20:44,691
No but with my intelligence
and cleverness.

231
00:20:45,529 --> 00:20:51,832
Now look at me. How I have
publicized my and Kusum's affair?

232
00:20:52,903 --> 00:20:58,705
We are as if like a... like a
pair of needle and thread.

233
00:21:00,077 --> 00:21:02,307
That means sir this all is not true?

234
00:21:02,412 --> 00:21:06,314
No but you all felt it was, this
is the leadership quality.

235
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:09,317
Which you'll get in my group.

236
00:21:10,454 --> 00:21:19,487
But she doesn't even
spit on my face.

237
00:21:23,533 --> 00:21:30,063
Oh! Come in. You all came together?
What's there to laugh?

238
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:31,731
Come in sit, sit.

239
00:21:32,376 --> 00:21:37,678
It feels so good we have met
after such a long time. Sit. Sit.

240
00:21:42,052 --> 00:21:44,020
Now say what you'll have?
- Nothing - Nothing.

241
00:21:44,121 --> 00:21:46,681
We have already eaten.
- No, you all will...

242
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:49,816
...have to eat something. Shagun!
- Yes, sister.

243
00:21:50,761 --> 00:21:56,597
Come in front. These are my college
friends they won't eat you.

244
00:22:00,404 --> 00:22:01,837
Ok, go and bring some
fruits for them.

245
00:22:04,608 --> 00:22:06,371
Do you guys know who she is?
She is my younger sister.

246
00:22:06,743 --> 00:22:08,438
Shakuntala.
- We know. - We know.

247
00:22:08,912 --> 00:22:11,710
Now say what's the matter?
- There is an annual function...

248
00:22:11,815 --> 00:22:15,376
...in the college. Of the
Scout Boys Association.

249
00:22:15,485 --> 00:22:17,385
And this time we'll celebrate
with great pomp.

250
00:22:17,487 --> 00:22:19,387
On a grand scale.
- Very good! You should celebrate.

251
00:22:19,489 --> 00:22:22,390
But when you say grand
then how grand is it?

252
00:22:22,492 --> 00:22:24,653
We have thought to invite
the collector's wife. - Ok.

253
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:27,525
Since you want the government
to grant.

254
00:22:27,631 --> 00:22:29,599
Therefore you are inviting
the collector's wife.

255
00:22:29,699 --> 00:22:31,394
That means the collector
will be on our side.

256
00:22:31,501 --> 00:22:34,402
And our grant will be finalised.
Wonderful!

257
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:37,797
Ok. - But it cannot be
possible without you.

258
00:22:37,908 --> 00:22:40,604
Really, it won't be
possible without me?

259
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:43,941
Because some people here
think that I am a fool.

260
00:22:44,514 --> 00:22:47,415
What are you saying?
Lts in your hand to...

261
00:22:47,517 --> 00:22:49,542
...make this annual function
a successful one.

262
00:22:49,653 --> 00:22:54,647
You have cut your fingers?
- No, it's ok. - What ok?

263
00:22:54,758 --> 00:22:56,953
You must be bleeding?
- No, I am not.

264
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:59,585
No, why isn't there
blood in your body?

265
00:23:02,532 --> 00:23:05,126
No please don't.
- What please don't?

266
00:23:05,235 --> 00:23:07,430
Your finger is cut and
bleeding and you are...

267
00:23:07,537 --> 00:23:10,665
...saying please don't. Now directly
visit the doctor from here.

268
00:23:10,774 --> 00:23:13,766
That's ok but the money?
- Doctor's fees?

269
00:23:13,877 --> 00:23:16,437
No for the annual function.
- But of course.

270
00:23:16,546 --> 00:23:20,482
I'll give that.
- But when? - Whenever you say.

271
00:23:20,584 --> 00:23:22,449
To decide that we have called
a meeting at the...

272
00:23:22,552 --> 00:23:25,487
...college at 5:00 o' clock.
- Ok then I'll be there at 4:30.

273
00:23:25,589 --> 00:23:33,553
Bye. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye.
- Bye. - See you soon.

274
00:23:35,098 --> 00:23:38,465
Sister, will you really
attend the meeting?

275
00:23:38,568 --> 00:23:40,866
Why should I tell you?
Are you my grandmother?

276
00:23:40,971 --> 00:23:43,963
You always keep asking where I
am going. For what am I going?

277
00:23:44,074 --> 00:23:46,804
When I'll return? Why do
you bother me like this?

278
00:23:47,544 --> 00:23:50,980
Because I feel hurt.
Hurt about what?

279
00:23:51,081 --> 00:23:53,106
We eat good food, we
wear good clothes.

280
00:23:53,216 --> 00:23:55,480
We have a house to live.
What more do we want?

281
00:23:55,585 --> 00:23:59,487
Our lost respect?
- Means? - There was a time when...

282
00:23:59,589 --> 00:24:02,490
...people were afraid
of facing our dad.

283
00:24:02,592 --> 00:24:05,959
But now he is not able to
see anyone in their eyes.

284
00:24:06,062 --> 00:24:09,498
Why? I have not stopped
him to do so.

285
00:24:10,534 --> 00:24:13,503
Why don't you try to understand?
He has...

286
00:24:13,603 --> 00:24:17,767
...helped so many girls financially
to get married.

287
00:24:18,542 --> 00:24:25,505
But now see he always keeps crying.
- Why? - Because of you.

288
00:24:25,615 --> 00:24:29,779
Get lost! I'll give you
a slap. You blame me?

289
00:24:29,886 --> 00:24:34,516
Sister! - Now what? - You never
try to understand any thing.

290
00:24:34,691 --> 00:24:38,957
Ok I'll tell you one thing.
Those boys who came here.

291
00:24:39,596 --> 00:24:43,657
The one who cut his finger.
- Yes, poor guy. - Poor guy.

292
00:24:43,767 --> 00:24:48,534
There were many girls around
why didn't they...

293
00:24:48,638 --> 00:24:53,974
...hold his hand? - Oh my God!
That man cut his finger.

294
00:24:54,077 --> 00:24:56,705
He was bleeding I just tied
a cloth on his finger.

295
00:24:56,813 --> 00:25:00,544
Is this a sin? How mean this
world is...

296
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:03,551
And when you behave like a
child in this cruel world...

297
00:25:03,653 --> 00:25:07,180
...then it gives that goon Bake
a chance to slander our image.

298
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:08,985
Beware if you took that goon's name!

299
00:25:09,092 --> 00:25:10,559
He only says this!

300
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:15,222
Let him do it! What do I care!
He only is spoiling his name!

301
00:25:15,332 --> 00:25:17,266
But we are humiliated.

302
00:25:17,734 --> 00:25:24,572
I implore you. Get a grip
over yourself. - How?

303
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:33,647
She can't tell me and she acts
as if she knows everything!

304
00:25:34,951 --> 00:25:40,116
"Fair damsel! You stole my heart!"

305
00:25:42,626 --> 00:25:45,618
What are you writing!
Didn't you read?

306
00:25:45,729 --> 00:25:49,256
Yes, I did read it. Stick no bills.
- Then why do you write?

307
00:25:49,366 --> 00:25:51,596
I don't know English!

308
00:25:52,636 --> 00:25:55,161
I ask you what do you write
and why do you write it!

309
00:25:55,338 --> 00:25:58,933
Soap to make you go bald,
Badshah soap!

310
00:25:59,042 --> 00:26:01,602
Shut up! Vagabonds!

311
00:26:02,712 --> 00:26:05,738
You don't have any work! You
only roam around the city!

312
00:26:05,849 --> 00:26:09,842
Go away! Go away! Otherwise
I will send you to prison!

313
00:26:12,022 --> 00:26:15,685
First tie your daughter's
legs with chains!

314
00:26:15,792 --> 00:26:20,923
The whole world knows who
is flirting with her!

315
00:26:21,031 --> 00:26:22,828
While she dances!

316
00:26:22,932 --> 00:26:26,060
"Fair damsel! You stole my heart!"

317
00:26:34,944 --> 00:26:37,640
Sister, I am tired of
explaining to you.

318
00:26:37,747 --> 00:26:40,011
But you don't understand.
You have got ready to go.

319
00:26:40,116 --> 00:26:41,344
Who is going?

320
00:26:41,451 --> 00:26:44,249
I am going to tell them that
I won't be able to come.

321
00:26:44,354 --> 00:26:48,085
Sister, what tragedy will happen
if you don't go today?

322
00:26:48,191 --> 00:26:50,716
Remember, if you go out today then...

323
00:26:50,827 --> 00:26:56,265
Shakuntala, let her go...
where she wants to go.

324
00:26:56,399 --> 00:27:02,304
Daddy is so nice! Daddy, now tell
me. Which car should I take?

325
00:27:02,405 --> 00:27:04,930
The luxury car or the small one?
- As you wish.

326
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:06,269
Thank you, daddy.

327
00:27:27,397 --> 00:27:30,298
Daddy... how did this mirror break?

328
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:35,133
You see the broken mirror.
But you don't see my heart.

329
00:27:35,271 --> 00:27:38,263
It will break very soon like this.

330
00:27:38,374 --> 00:27:41,707
Oh no, daddy! Come with
me to the doctor! - No.

331
00:27:41,811 --> 00:27:43,711
Why? If something happened to you...

332
00:27:43,813 --> 00:27:45,974
...then what will happen to us?

333
00:27:46,082 --> 00:27:51,748
Dear, no doctor has the cure of
the ailment that is plaguing me.

334
00:27:51,855 --> 00:27:53,720
Only you have it.

335
00:27:53,857 --> 00:27:58,385
You have a grip on yourself,
I will get well on my own.

336
00:27:58,495 --> 00:28:01,726
Daddy, even you are
talking like Shagun.

337
00:28:01,931 --> 00:28:03,728
Can I ask you something?

338
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,835
You also think that I am a vagabond?

339
00:28:06,936 --> 00:28:09,769
If you really become a vagabond...

340
00:28:09,873 --> 00:28:12,103
...then I can die peacefully.

341
00:28:12,208 --> 00:28:16,235
But no. You are so naiee.

342
00:28:16,346 --> 00:28:19,747
You don't even know
what a vagabond is.

343
00:28:19,849 --> 00:28:23,148
I can't even die, leaving
you in this state.

344
00:28:23,787 --> 00:28:28,747
Kusum dear, so many
guys came to see you.

345
00:28:29,826 --> 00:28:32,989
They talked about marriage
and they immediately left.

346
00:28:33,096 --> 00:28:37,430
Why? Try to understand something.

347
00:28:37,934 --> 00:28:43,201
Maybe because I am not
very pretty, daddy.

348
00:28:43,306 --> 00:28:45,797
Who says that you are not pretty?

349
00:28:45,909 --> 00:28:49,003
The root cause of the problem
is that you are pretty.

350
00:28:49,112 --> 00:28:50,773
Thank you, daddy.

351
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,781
How do I explain to you? Forget it.

352
00:28:54,083 --> 00:28:57,780
You will stay at home for 2-4
days. Don't venture out.

353
00:28:57,887 --> 00:29:00,048
Why!
- Some people are coming to see you!

354
00:29:00,156 --> 00:29:03,125
Really! When?
- Anytime.

355
00:29:03,226 --> 00:29:07,788
Daddy, if I knew for sure, then I
would have tied some loose ends.

356
00:29:07,897 --> 00:29:10,195
You won't even try to understand.

357
00:29:40,997 --> 00:29:44,558
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning. You?

358
00:29:44,667 --> 00:29:45,827
Yes, me.

359
00:29:45,935 --> 00:29:48,529
First sign on this. This is urgent.

360
00:29:48,638 --> 00:29:49,935
You can do the other work later.

361
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:51,472
There is enough time for that.

362
00:29:59,115 --> 00:30:00,412
Good morning, sir.

363
00:30:08,958 --> 00:30:10,858
What have you typed?

364
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,860
I had said that our
manager is leaving.

365
00:30:12,962 --> 00:30:14,088
And you have typed loving.

366
00:30:14,197 --> 00:30:16,859
Sorry, sir. My mistake.

367
00:30:16,966 --> 00:30:18,593
This is your first mistake,
isn't it? - Yes, sir.

368
00:30:18,701 --> 00:30:21,864
Then MD should not come to know
about this. - Yes, sir.

369
00:30:21,971 --> 00:30:25,372
It is better if this remains
between us. - Thank you, sir.

370
00:30:25,475 --> 00:30:27,238
Type it again.
- Yes, sir.

371
00:30:27,343 --> 00:30:28,867
Listen!
- Sir.

372
00:30:29,245 --> 00:30:32,112
This time type love letter,
not leave letter.

373
00:30:32,949 --> 00:30:35,213
Leave letter, not love letter, sir.

374
00:30:38,321 --> 00:30:41,552
Sir.
- Nagapa, tell him.

375
00:30:43,326 --> 00:30:47,990
Whatever you want to ask Ram,
ask him in front of me.

376
00:30:48,097 --> 00:30:49,325
Yes, sir.

377
00:30:49,432 --> 00:30:56,895
Ram... you had submitted 2
applications in this office. - Yes.

378
00:30:57,006 --> 00:31:00,203
One was in the name of Ram for
the post of a peon. - Yes.

379
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:01,902
And the other was in the name of...

380
00:31:02,011 --> 00:31:04,571
...R. Chandra for the post
of an assistant manager.

381
00:31:04,681 --> 00:31:09,914
Yes. - It could be Ram Chandra
or Ravi Chandra. - Yes.

382
00:31:10,019 --> 00:31:12,920
What is the name of our
assistant manager?

383
00:31:13,022 --> 00:31:15,286
It is Ravi Chandra, not
Ram Chandra. - Yes.

384
00:31:15,959 --> 00:31:19,918
He is your friend.
- Yes. My best friend.

385
00:31:20,029 --> 00:31:23,192
Sir, please ask him to sit.
I am leaving. Greetings.

386
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:26,268
Wait! Now I want to
ask you something.

387
00:31:26,369 --> 00:31:28,929
When did you come to know
that Ravi Chandra...

388
00:31:29,038 --> 00:31:31,939
...is going to be appointed for the
post of an assistant manager?

389
00:31:32,041 --> 00:31:36,307
That day... when you signed
on the appointment letter.

390
00:31:36,412 --> 00:31:39,245
It implies before he got the job?
- Yes, sir.

391
00:31:39,349 --> 00:31:42,944
Why didn't you tell me before!
This is fraud!

392
00:31:43,052 --> 00:31:46,044
Sir... he...

393
00:31:47,023 --> 00:31:49,457
Sorry, sir. Sir, I
forgot to tell you.

394
00:31:50,026 --> 00:31:51,960
The other appointment letter
in the name of R. Chandra...

395
00:31:52,061 --> 00:31:54,291
...I did not receive it through post.

396
00:31:54,397 --> 00:31:57,332
Then? - He delivered it
to my place. - What!

397
00:31:57,433 --> 00:32:00,960
Sir, then he started saying
if I give him that letter...

398
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:05,006
...for his relative, then he
will give me 3000 rupees.

399
00:32:05,108 --> 00:32:08,976
Then? - Then sir, today
Ravi got his salary.

400
00:32:09,078 --> 00:32:10,978
And he threatened
us that we should...

401
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,138
...give him some money otherwise...

402
00:32:12,281 --> 00:32:16,581
Nagapa, is this true?
- Sorry, sir.

403
00:32:18,054 --> 00:32:25,017
Nagapa, I am not a fool. I gave
such a high post to Ravi.

404
00:32:25,128 --> 00:32:26,618
Then I must have thought
about it well.

405
00:32:26,729 --> 00:32:29,596
If Ram wanted, then he could
have had this post.

406
00:32:29,699 --> 00:32:33,362
But Ram told me to give
this post to Ravi.

407
00:32:33,469 --> 00:32:35,334
Because it will give Ravi
a new life. Understood?

408
00:32:35,438 --> 00:32:39,397
Yes, sir. Punjabi's friend
is a Punjabi. - Nagapa!

409
00:32:41,177 --> 00:32:43,008
I gave Ravi this job because
of his intellect...

410
00:32:43,112 --> 00:32:45,637
...not because of his caste.

411
00:32:46,182 --> 00:32:52,018
Nagapa, I dismiss you. For
taking and giving bribe.

412
00:32:52,121 --> 00:32:55,488
People are spreading hatred
in our country.

413
00:32:55,591 --> 00:32:58,424
And people like you are spreading
it, not people like Ram.

414
00:32:58,528 --> 00:32:59,654
Get out!

415
00:33:02,131 --> 00:33:03,621
Sir...
- Get out!

416
00:33:13,543 --> 00:33:15,033
Sir.

417
00:33:17,213 --> 00:33:20,740
I? Sir? What's the matter, ma'am?

418
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:25,052
Greetings, sir. - Greetings?
Why are you greeting me?

419
00:33:25,254 --> 00:33:29,247
Hitherto I used to think
of you as a peon.

420
00:33:29,358 --> 00:33:32,589
An ordinary peon. But now...
- Now?

421
00:33:33,262 --> 00:33:35,059
Greetings, sir.

422
00:33:44,373 --> 00:33:47,399
This is our new budget.
Listen to it.

423
00:33:48,444 --> 00:33:53,074
The rent of new house, 150 rupees.
- Why new house?

424
00:33:53,182 --> 00:33:55,082
Are we going to live
in this ramshackle...

425
00:33:55,184 --> 00:33:56,208
...house for the rest of our lives?

426
00:33:56,319 --> 00:33:57,411
Listen further.

427
00:33:58,187 --> 00:34:02,283
Grocery expenses and the salary
of the chef, 150 rupees.

428
00:34:02,391 --> 00:34:06,225
Why? - You don't interfere
in matter of food.

429
00:34:06,329 --> 00:34:08,320
I will die eating
this 'ldli Sambar'.

430
00:34:08,431 --> 00:34:10,126
Let me eat bread too.

431
00:34:13,202 --> 00:34:15,102
Suit and shoes expenses, now that
you have become an officer...

432
00:34:15,204 --> 00:34:17,832
...and laundry expense
will be 200 rupees.

433
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,840
Unnecessary expenses!

434
00:34:19,942 --> 00:34:21,102
What do you mean!

435
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:23,110
Doesn't our combined salary
amount to 500 rupees?

436
00:34:23,212 --> 00:34:24,804
Yes. - Then why shouldn't
we live royally?

437
00:34:24,914 --> 00:34:27,109
Look, you can do whatever
you want with your salary.

438
00:34:27,216 --> 00:34:29,184
But forget my salary.
- What!

439
00:34:29,552 --> 00:34:33,852
I am an officer, not a peon. I
have some personal expense too.

440
00:34:33,956 --> 00:34:36,151
I see! So this is the matter!

441
00:34:36,359 --> 00:34:38,486
I won't even spit on your salary!
- Post!

442
00:34:38,594 --> 00:34:39,618
Coming!

443
00:34:46,335 --> 00:34:50,135
How many letters have you brought,
postman? A bagful?

444
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:54,175
Why not? After all, a Prince
resides in this palace.

445
00:34:54,277 --> 00:34:58,839
1 letter? Then it must be
mine. An ordinary peon.

446
00:35:16,365 --> 00:35:18,390
Hey, affluent man! Come here!

447
00:35:18,601 --> 00:35:21,365
What happened? Is it
letter from home?

448
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:23,267
Is everything fine?
- Yes.

449
00:35:23,472 --> 00:35:29,240
Father writes... Ram son, my
lawyer's fees were due.

450
00:35:29,345 --> 00:35:31,176
So I had lied in the
last letter that...

451
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,339
...your mother needs to be
admitted in the hospital.

452
00:35:33,449 --> 00:35:36,247
I got the 1000 rupees
that you had sent.

453
00:35:38,254 --> 00:35:41,712
Did you send those 1000
rupees? Answer me!

454
00:35:41,824 --> 00:35:43,189
So what if I sent it?

455
00:35:43,292 --> 00:35:45,192
But from where did you
get so much money?

456
00:35:45,394 --> 00:35:48,192
I took a loan. On interest.

457
00:35:48,297 --> 00:35:52,233
Loan? Interest?

458
00:35:52,335 --> 00:35:55,566
I am an officer. Can't I get a loan?

459
00:35:55,671 --> 00:35:57,298
I will repay it in 3 installments.

460
00:35:58,374 --> 00:36:04,802
You are crying? Did I commit a
mistake? Are you angry with me?

461
00:36:04,914 --> 00:36:08,577
You! Beware if you continued
to act so formally!

462
00:36:08,751 --> 00:36:11,219
If you really consider
me as your brother...

463
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,914
...then address me informally.

464
00:36:14,023 --> 00:36:16,685
Why are you being so formal!
- Ram.

465
00:36:18,327 --> 00:36:23,264
Buddy, people say that a brother's
love is the highest.

466
00:36:23,399 --> 00:36:27,961
Yes, it is. Because it
is a blood relation.

467
00:36:28,337 --> 00:36:30,430
But I don't agree with it.

468
00:36:30,673 --> 00:36:33,699
There is another relation
greater than this.

469
00:36:34,343 --> 00:36:37,312
That of friendship.
- Yes.

470
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:41,780
You are the live example
of that, Ram. - 

471
00:36:53,963 --> 00:36:54,987
No!

472
00:37:08,644 --> 00:37:09,872
Wow!

473
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:12,677
Wow!

474
00:37:16,385 --> 00:37:18,285
Wow! Wow!

475
00:37:22,058 --> 00:37:24,288
Wow!
- What is going on?

476
00:37:24,393 --> 00:37:26,486
The aroma of Punjab.

477
00:37:29,365 --> 00:37:32,596
The calling of paratha.
- Hey!

478
00:37:32,702 --> 00:37:34,431
Sorry, sir. Ravi!

479
00:37:35,371 --> 00:37:36,929
Let's go to have lunch.

480
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:41,635
In the canteen! 'ldli'.
No! You only go!

481
00:37:43,379 --> 00:37:44,368
Yes, sir.

482
00:37:45,481 --> 00:37:46,505
Lata.

483
00:37:48,384 --> 00:37:49,442
Thank you, sir.

484
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:53,752
Lata.
- Yes, sir.

485
00:37:56,359 --> 00:38:00,318
I have an urgent work. Don't think
anything else. - No, sir.

486
00:38:01,497 --> 00:38:08,733
Today after office hours... don't
think anything else. - No, sir.

487
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:17,067
The park besides the school...
only for 5 minutes alone.

488
00:38:17,179 --> 00:38:20,080
Don't think anything else.
- No, sir.

489
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:23,351
Fine?
- Fine, sir.

490
00:38:33,662 --> 00:38:35,857
Greetings, sir.
- Greetings.

491
00:38:41,437 --> 00:38:43,371
Lata.
- Yes, sir.

492
00:38:43,606 --> 00:38:45,540
I have an urgent work.

493
00:38:45,641 --> 00:38:48,633
Tell me, sir. I will do it. Even
if I have to work overtime.

494
00:38:48,744 --> 00:38:51,008
It is not related to office that
you will have to do overtime.

495
00:38:51,113 --> 00:38:53,411
No?
- It is my personal work.

496
00:38:53,516 --> 00:38:54,813
I will do that too, sir.

497
00:38:56,452 --> 00:38:58,784
Don't think anything else.
- No, sir. Promise.

498
00:38:58,888 --> 00:39:01,049
I will understand what
you will explain.

499
00:39:01,157 --> 00:39:03,523
Then let's sit.
- Oh yes! Yes!

500
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:17,405
Lata... it is a secret.
- Yes, sir.

501
00:39:17,606 --> 00:39:23,010
And that is, in our office,
don't think anything else.

502
00:39:23,512 --> 00:39:29,041
There is a Punjabi girl.
- Kammo!

503
00:39:29,151 --> 00:39:33,144
Yes. Don't think anything else.
- No, sir.

504
00:39:33,522 --> 00:39:36,753
As soon as possible, find out
whether she is married or not.

505
00:39:36,859 --> 00:39:39,794
If she is unmarried, then
is she ready to marry?

506
00:39:40,529 --> 00:39:43,987
Marriage?
- Yes. - Such a trivial matter?

507
00:39:44,166 --> 00:39:49,433
But this is an important work.
My friend, Ram... - That peon!

508
00:39:49,538 --> 00:39:52,132
Peon? Maybe you don't know.

509
00:39:52,241 --> 00:39:54,436
If he wanted, then he could have
been the assistant manager.

510
00:39:54,543 --> 00:39:56,943
I know. He is a nice man.

511
00:39:57,046 --> 00:39:59,742
Then we should do something
for such a nice man.

512
00:39:59,915 --> 00:40:05,876
I mean both of us together.
- Together? Yes, together.

513
00:40:05,988 --> 00:40:08,115
What is the most important
thing to live?

514
00:40:09,625 --> 00:40:13,186
Love. - More important
than that? - Marriage.

515
00:40:14,497 --> 00:40:17,955
The most important thing to
live is food. - Yes, food.

516
00:40:18,634 --> 00:40:20,602
Do you know what Punjabis eat?

517
00:40:20,703 --> 00:40:22,864
Yes, 'Chole Bature', vegetables,
bread.

518
00:40:22,972 --> 00:40:25,668
That poor man should at least
get decent meals, twice a day.

519
00:40:25,841 --> 00:40:31,143
That is what he doesn't get.
I can eat anything.

520
00:40:31,247 --> 00:40:34,011
'Ldli Sambar, Dosa'.
But he often starves.

521
00:40:34,116 --> 00:40:35,811
Poor man!

522
00:40:36,051 --> 00:40:41,216
That's why this is a secret.
- I understood!

523
00:40:41,323 --> 00:40:44,121
Ask cunningly.
- Yes.

524
00:40:44,226 --> 00:40:46,490
Your greatest advantage
is that you are a girl.

525
00:40:46,595 --> 00:40:49,063
Then tomorrow.
- Same time.

526
00:40:49,164 --> 00:40:52,497
Look, don't think anything else.

527
00:40:52,601 --> 00:40:56,628
The story doesn't end here.
- It shouldn't end, sir.

528
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,747
Why are you all laughing!

529
00:41:06,582 --> 00:41:08,516
First tell me, then laugh.

530
00:41:08,617 --> 00:41:10,244
We are talking about
the wedding night.

531
00:41:10,352 --> 00:41:12,183
You won't understand.
- Why?

532
00:41:12,288 --> 00:41:16,816
You are just a kid.
- Do tell me!

533
00:41:16,926 --> 00:41:18,257
Go away!

534
00:41:38,814 --> 00:41:44,218
"I am 17 years old.
My braid is so long."

535
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:50,252
"Look, my eyes are like
colourful marbles."

536
00:41:50,593 --> 00:41:56,031
"I am 17 years old.
My braid is so long."

537
00:41:56,165 --> 00:42:01,728
"Look, my eyes are like
colourful marbles."

538
00:42:01,837 --> 00:42:05,034
"Baby, you are a kid."

539
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:08,109
"Baby, you are a kid."

540
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:11,008
"Baby, you are a kid."

541
00:42:11,113 --> 00:42:14,048
"Baby, you are a kid."

542
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:46,612
"What do you all talk secretly?"

543
00:42:46,715 --> 00:42:52,620
"Tell me. Why are you
all afraid of me?"

544
00:42:52,721 --> 00:42:58,353
"Don't think that you
are very smart."

545
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:04,365
"Don't think that I am a fool."

546
00:43:04,466 --> 00:43:10,371
"Really? Tell me, what love is?"

547
00:43:10,706 --> 00:43:13,834
"Baby, you are a kid."

548
00:43:13,942 --> 00:43:16,672
"Baby, you are a kid."

549
00:43:16,779 --> 00:43:19,714
"Baby, you are a kid."

550
00:43:19,815 --> 00:43:22,682
"Baby, you are a kid."

551
00:43:22,785 --> 00:43:28,246
"I am 17 years old.
My braid is so long."

552
00:43:28,357 --> 00:43:34,353
"Look, my eyes are like
colourful marbles."

553
00:43:55,384 --> 00:44:00,981
"Why does the bee kiss the flower?"

554
00:44:01,323 --> 00:44:07,193
"Why does cloud sway
over the mountain? '

555
00:44:07,296 --> 00:44:08,695
"Tell me."

556
00:44:08,797 --> 00:44:10,128
"How?"

557
00:44:12,067 --> 00:44:13,432
"What do I know?"

558
00:44:13,535 --> 00:44:18,768
"One day youth will befall on you."

559
00:44:18,874 --> 00:44:24,779
"Then you will understand
this story."

560
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:30,841
"Why does pain awakens when
the world is asleep? '

561
00:44:30,953 --> 00:44:34,116
"Baby, you are a kid."

562
00:44:34,223 --> 00:44:37,158
"Baby, you are a kid."

563
00:44:37,259 --> 00:44:40,023
"Baby, you are a kid."

564
00:44:40,129 --> 00:44:43,030
"Baby, you are a kid."

565
00:44:43,132 --> 00:44:45,896
"Baby, you are a kid."

566
00:44:46,001 --> 00:44:48,799
"Baby, you are a kid."

567
00:44:49,838 --> 00:44:51,271
You?

568
00:44:52,775 --> 00:44:55,437
It's good that I met you. Otherwise
I would have come.

569
00:44:55,544 --> 00:44:56,738
You would have come to meet me?
- Yes.

570
00:44:56,845 --> 00:45:01,748
Great! How can I serve you?
- Shall I tell you? - Yes.

571
00:45:02,818 --> 00:45:06,481
Whenever father sees me, he starts
crying. Because of you!

572
00:45:06,588 --> 00:45:10,752
Because of me? Why?
- As if you don't know.

573
00:45:10,859 --> 00:45:13,089
You only tell everybody that
I have become vagabond.

574
00:45:13,195 --> 00:45:16,289
I say this. I am bound to say this.

575
00:45:16,398 --> 00:45:18,059
After all you are
such a girl, Kusum.

576
00:45:18,167 --> 00:45:20,795
But this is lie! Am I right?
- Yes.

577
00:45:21,203 --> 00:45:26,800
But I say it in such a manner
that this lie seems true.

578
00:45:26,909 --> 00:45:29,776
A beautiful truth!
- How?

579
00:45:29,878 --> 00:45:32,813
I will show you. Look, you didn't
do anything, did you?

580
00:45:32,915 --> 00:45:36,476
No.
- But your image is slandered.

581
00:45:36,585 --> 00:45:40,043
Because of you.
- Do me one more favour.

582
00:45:40,155 --> 00:45:42,385
The scores will be settled.
- How?

583
00:45:42,491 --> 00:45:46,086
Just once a bit...
- What?

584
00:45:46,195 --> 00:45:48,163
Become wayward.

585
00:45:54,903 --> 00:45:56,996
You are so cunning.
- Yes.

586
00:45:57,105 --> 00:45:59,005
Cunning and ruffian!

587
00:45:59,107 --> 00:46:01,337
How can I become good
if I become wayward?

588
00:46:01,443 --> 00:46:03,104
Leave that on me.

589
00:46:03,212 --> 00:46:05,146
Hitherto I have lied.

590
00:46:05,247 --> 00:46:07,010
From tomorrow, I will start
speaking the truth.

591
00:46:07,115 --> 00:46:09,811
But the same condition. Quick
engagement quick marriage!

592
00:46:09,918 --> 00:46:11,852
Keep quiet! Otherwise I will
give you a tight slap!

593
00:46:11,954 --> 00:46:13,444
What is good, that will remain good.

594
00:46:13,555 --> 00:46:16,854
And those who wish others ill,
they can never be happy.

595
00:46:16,959 --> 00:46:19,894
And yes, you will be ruined!

596
00:46:21,930 --> 00:46:24,831
And you... till the time you
don't become wayward...

597
00:46:24,933 --> 00:46:28,391
...your image will remain slandered.

598
00:46:28,637 --> 00:46:33,074
Wayward and vagabond. Greetings.

599
00:46:35,510 --> 00:46:38,877
Yes. Hitherto we had
only heard about it.

600
00:46:38,981 --> 00:46:41,541
Today we saw it with our own eyes.

601
00:46:41,950 --> 00:46:47,013
We don't like to twist words.
We said what we saw.

602
00:46:48,891 --> 00:46:49,915
What did you see?

603
00:46:50,025 --> 00:46:54,860
Your sister Kusum was talking to
that goon Bankelal in the park.

604
00:46:54,963 --> 00:46:57,124
Not only this, they
were laughing too.

605
00:46:57,966 --> 00:47:00,867
Look, go away from here!

606
00:47:00,969 --> 00:47:05,201
Great! Younger sister is not any
less than the elder sister.

607
00:47:05,307 --> 00:47:09,038
These people don't even understand...

608
00:47:09,144 --> 00:47:11,442
...that even we have unmarried
daughters in our house.

609
00:47:11,546 --> 00:47:12,877
And because of his daughter,
they are facing...

610
00:47:12,981 --> 00:47:14,915
...problems in their marriage.

611
00:47:15,017 --> 00:47:16,211
Listen, Lala.

612
00:47:16,318 --> 00:47:18,183
If my daughter had been such...

613
00:47:18,287 --> 00:47:20,414
...then by now I would
have killed her!

614
00:47:34,937 --> 00:47:36,564
No, daddy! No!
- Leave me!

615
00:47:56,024 --> 00:47:58,424
Daddy, when did you buy this pistol?

616
00:47:58,527 --> 00:47:59,653
It has bullets, doesn't it?

617
00:48:02,030 --> 00:48:03,930
It is good that you got this.

618
00:48:04,032 --> 00:48:05,932
Now no robber will
dare to come here!

619
00:48:06,034 --> 00:48:08,400
And if he comes then...

620
00:48:25,387 --> 00:48:32,953
Daddy... you are crying. Daddy,
why are you crying?

621
00:48:34,363 --> 00:48:38,231
First tell me, then you can cry.
- Leave me alone.

622
00:48:41,269 --> 00:48:44,500
I don't understand.
Why you are crying?

623
00:48:44,606 --> 00:48:47,973
Daddy, you are crying because...

624
00:48:48,076 --> 00:48:50,567
...you couldn't kill Kusum
sister, aren't you?

625
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:53,980
Just think, daddy.

626
00:48:54,216 --> 00:48:55,979
Since the time brother
left, people...

627
00:48:56,084 --> 00:48:59,485
...have been talking
rubbish about sister.

628
00:49:00,088 --> 00:49:02,989
If you had done something, then
it would have confirmed...

629
00:49:03,091 --> 00:49:07,391
...people's doubt that something
is surely fishy. - Shakuntala!

630
00:49:08,063 --> 00:49:11,658
Daddy, if you want to kill her,
then why this pistol!

631
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:15,001
Go and stand in the middle
of the street...

632
00:49:15,103 --> 00:49:19,005
...and say that my daughter
is a vagabond.

633
00:49:19,107 --> 00:49:22,133
She will die. She will die.

634
00:49:24,112 --> 00:49:27,479
For God's sake, keep quiet!
For God's sake.

635
00:49:30,185 --> 00:49:33,552
Tell me, did you meet
that ruffian today?

636
00:49:33,655 --> 00:49:35,213
Yes, daddy. I spoke to him too.

637
00:49:36,091 --> 00:49:37,183
You spoke to him? What
did you speak to him?

638
00:49:37,292 --> 00:49:38,589
You know what he said, daddy?

639
00:49:38,693 --> 00:49:41,184
He said that you did
not do anything.

640
00:49:41,296 --> 00:49:43,730
Still your image is slandered.
Because of me.

641
00:49:44,132 --> 00:49:48,034
Now do one favour on me. Become
a bit more wayward.

642
00:49:48,136 --> 00:49:50,036
And I will tell everybody
that you are a nice girl.

643
00:49:50,138 --> 00:49:54,040
Ruffian! - You know what I
told him, daddy? - What?

644
00:49:54,142 --> 00:49:57,077
I told him, what is good that
will always remain good.

645
00:49:57,179 --> 00:50:00,706
And those who wish others ill,
they can never be happy!

646
00:50:00,816 --> 00:50:04,547
And you will be ruined! I back
answered him in such a way!

647
00:50:04,653 --> 00:50:07,588
In anger. Did I do the
right thing, daddy?

648
00:50:08,123 --> 00:50:13,220
Yes, dear. Daddy!
- Yes.

649
00:50:13,328 --> 00:50:17,059
You were saying that some guy
is coming to see me. - Yes.

650
00:50:17,165 --> 00:50:19,065
When will he come?
- He will come.

651
00:50:19,167 --> 00:50:23,103
But when?
- When you are destined for it.

652
00:50:31,913 --> 00:50:33,437
Greetings.
- Greetings.

653
00:50:33,548 --> 00:50:35,072
What happened?

654
00:50:35,183 --> 00:50:37,276
I went there early in the morning,
sir. - You found her?

655
00:50:37,385 --> 00:50:39,376
Yes, sir.
- You spoke to her?

656
00:50:39,488 --> 00:50:43,254
How could I do that, sir!
I could not speak. - What!

657
00:50:43,358 --> 00:50:46,088
Yes, sir. Actually when
I reached there...

658
00:50:46,194 --> 00:50:48,287
...Kammo was going out with 2 kids.

659
00:50:48,396 --> 00:50:49,624
2 kids?
- Yes, sir.

660
00:50:49,731 --> 00:50:52,666
And 2 kids were in
her husband's lap.

661
00:50:52,767 --> 00:50:55,463
What! 4 children!
- Yes.

662
00:50:56,204 --> 00:50:59,662
I hope that you didn't tell her
that I have sent you, did you?

663
00:50:59,774 --> 00:51:01,765
I told her, sir.
- What!

664
00:51:01,877 --> 00:51:06,314
I just couldn't speak! - Now it
is better if you don't speak!

665
00:51:06,414 --> 00:51:08,507
No, sir. Don't talk like this.

666
00:51:08,683 --> 00:51:12,175
Can I tell you something so
that your work will be done?

667
00:51:12,287 --> 00:51:16,155
Tell me. - Your friend, don't
think anything else.

668
00:51:16,258 --> 00:51:19,625
Tell me.
- Instead of that girl, I.

669
00:51:19,728 --> 00:51:21,127
You?
- Yes.

670
00:51:21,229 --> 00:51:23,823
Look, I will quickly learn
how to cook Punjabi food.

671
00:51:23,932 --> 00:51:26,264
I have learnt typing. And
my speed is also not bad.

672
00:51:26,368 --> 00:51:28,131
I know that.
- Am I right?

673
00:51:28,236 --> 00:51:30,136
I found out that day when
you typed leaving...

674
00:51:30,238 --> 00:51:32,502
...I mean loving instead of leaving.

675
00:51:32,607 --> 00:51:35,735
But sir, I will never make
this mistake again.

676
00:51:35,844 --> 00:51:36,868
Is it acceptable to you?

677
00:51:36,978 --> 00:51:40,607
Look, you very well know that only
2 types of girls cook at home.

678
00:51:40,715 --> 00:51:43,149
One is servant and
the other is wife.

679
00:51:43,251 --> 00:51:46,243
Then it is fine, sir.
- What! As a servant?

680
00:51:46,354 --> 00:51:48,652
No, sir. As a wife.

681
00:51:49,257 --> 00:51:52,420
But Ram has never thought about you.

682
00:51:53,195 --> 00:51:54,355
Even I have never thought about him!

683
00:51:54,529 --> 00:51:59,228
Whom do you think about?
- I...

684
00:51:59,334 --> 00:52:01,461
Tell me!
- Oh God!

685
00:52:12,214 --> 00:52:13,238
What is going on?

686
00:52:15,283 --> 00:52:18,252
It is not my fault.
- Sir. - Keep quiet!

687
00:52:18,353 --> 00:52:19,820
You too keep quiet!

688
00:52:22,257 --> 00:52:25,420
Your mother and father.
- I don't have mother.

689
00:52:25,527 --> 00:52:29,623
I understood. Any siblings?
- No.

690
00:52:29,731 --> 00:52:31,790
Then you are the sole supporter
of your father?

691
00:52:33,602 --> 00:52:36,196
That's why you work.
- Yes.

692
00:52:36,304 --> 00:52:39,705
That's why this affair.
- No, Ram! She is a nice girl.

693
00:52:39,808 --> 00:52:42,709
She is very straightforward.
- Ravi!

694
00:52:42,811 --> 00:52:43,835
I am sorry.

695
00:52:44,379 --> 00:52:45,710
Come with me.

696
00:52:49,284 --> 00:52:51,946
You stare at this girl.
- I...

697
00:52:52,053 --> 00:52:55,284
Do you stare at her! When she comes
to your cabin with the file!

698
00:52:55,390 --> 00:52:58,723
Tell me! It implies that
you like the girl.

699
00:52:59,327 --> 00:53:02,626
Come with me. Hey, girl!

700
00:53:04,332 --> 00:53:07,859
Tell your father that I will
come to meet him. - When?

701
00:53:09,304 --> 00:53:11,238
Day after tomorrow.
- Why not tomorrow?

702
00:53:16,611 --> 00:53:20,240
What do you want to do, Ram?
- What you want.

703
00:53:20,348 --> 00:53:22,543
But your parents, your
family members.

704
00:53:22,651 --> 00:53:26,246
They are there.
- But where?

705
00:53:26,354 --> 00:53:29,255
Here. In your form.

706
00:53:41,469 --> 00:53:44,461
Lata dear, go and see who has come.

707
00:53:51,646 --> 00:53:55,275
Hey, girl!
- Greetings. Greetings.

708
00:53:56,318 --> 00:53:59,378
Greetings. You told father
everything, didn't you?

709
00:54:02,457 --> 00:54:03,856
Is it acceptable to him?

710
00:54:07,662 --> 00:54:08,890
What happened?

711
00:54:09,964 --> 00:54:13,297
Father! Father! They have come.
- Come.

712
00:54:13,468 --> 00:54:15,595
Greetings.
- Greetings.

713
00:54:17,505 --> 00:54:18,938
Have a seat.

714
00:54:21,509 --> 00:54:23,875
Lata has told me everything.

715
00:54:23,978 --> 00:54:27,937
What kind of friend you are.
And what virtues you have.

716
00:54:28,049 --> 00:54:29,482
She didn't tell you
anything about him?

717
00:54:29,584 --> 00:54:33,384
I can very well see what kind
of a guy he is. - What!

718
00:54:34,489 --> 00:54:36,684
Saw his nervousness!

719
00:54:36,891 --> 00:54:38,859
Yes, today he is very nervous.

720
00:54:40,028 --> 00:54:41,325
So what have you thought?

721
00:54:41,429 --> 00:54:44,592
It is better if I tell
something about myself.

722
00:54:46,501 --> 00:54:50,335
No need for that.
- I think there is.

723
00:54:50,438 --> 00:54:53,339
I belong to Punjab.

724
00:54:54,509 --> 00:54:56,841
But my father came here
to do business.

725
00:54:57,846 --> 00:54:59,336
I grew up here only.

726
00:54:59,447 --> 00:55:04,077
And then one day I fell in love,
not with a Punjabi girl.

727
00:55:04,452 --> 00:55:06,579
She belongs to this place only.

728
00:55:07,422 --> 00:55:11,358
Then what was to happen? Our
communities protested it.

729
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:14,488
Lata's mother showed courage
and she stood by my side.

730
00:55:15,530 --> 00:55:18,522
While dying, she took my oath.

731
00:55:19,467 --> 00:55:23,597
That I get Lata married to
the guy whom she loves.

732
00:55:25,473 --> 00:55:27,373
So I clearly want to tell you.

733
00:55:28,576 --> 00:55:32,068
Lata is neither Punjabi nor
she belongs to this place.

734
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:35,381
Look, for us it is sufficient that...

735
00:55:35,483 --> 00:55:37,917
...the girl is good and
she is an Indian.

736
00:55:40,088 --> 00:55:42,056
Lata, do you like the guy?

737
00:55:43,425 --> 00:55:45,393
Ravi, do you like the girl?

738
00:55:46,428 --> 00:55:49,397
Now what is your decision?
- Same as theirs.

739
00:55:50,498 --> 00:55:52,125
But...
- But what?

740
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:56,129
We don't have anything else.
We have only this house.

741
00:55:56,504 --> 00:55:58,972
I know. Otherwise why would
Lata need to work?

742
00:55:59,073 --> 00:56:01,405
One more thing.
- What?

743
00:56:01,509 --> 00:56:03,636
After marriage, you both will
have to come here to live.

744
00:56:03,812 --> 00:56:06,872
Why?
- Because I had taken an oath.

745
00:56:06,981 --> 00:56:08,414
After Lata's marriage, I will
go for a pilgrimage...

746
00:56:08,516 --> 00:56:11,076
...to all the 4 sacred places.

747
00:56:11,886 --> 00:56:17,654
And look, Lata is my only daughter.
She has no siblings.

748
00:56:17,759 --> 00:56:19,954
Look, you can talk like
this only after my death.

749
00:56:21,496 --> 00:56:25,956
I will be with them for the rest
of my life... as a shadow.

750
00:56:26,601 --> 00:56:28,432
And I will do all those
things for your Lata...

751
00:56:28,536 --> 00:56:30,436
...that only a brother can do.

752
00:56:30,638 --> 00:56:34,438
God bless you, dear. God bless you.

753
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:00,966
Why are you touching my feet!
I have not grown old.

754
00:57:01,069 --> 00:57:03,469
Touch your father-in-law's feet.
- God bless you, dear.

755
00:57:07,575 --> 00:57:09,475
Ram.
- Yes.

756
00:57:10,712 --> 00:57:12,475
Dear, now I can peacefully
complete...

757
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:13,945
...the pilgrimage of all
the 4 sacred places.

758
00:57:14,048 --> 00:57:16,983
Yes. Don't worry about anything.

759
00:57:17,085 --> 00:57:19,485
What worries will I have,
when you are there?

760
00:57:19,687 --> 00:57:21,814
Bless me.
- God bless you.

761
00:57:33,067 --> 00:57:37,504
Wake up! Come on, quickly wake up.

762
00:57:41,676 --> 00:57:44,611
Get up.
- What's the hurry?

763
00:57:46,614 --> 00:57:48,514
Even the sun is my enemy.

764
00:57:48,616 --> 00:57:50,811
Come on, you have to go office too.

765
00:57:55,557 --> 00:57:58,048
You woke me up. But what
about your elder brother?

766
00:57:58,159 --> 00:57:59,558
I will wake him up too.

767
00:58:03,364 --> 00:58:04,661
Brother, get up.

768
00:58:08,903 --> 00:58:13,533
Cauliflower's parathas.

769
00:58:13,641 --> 00:58:17,600
Brother... take this coffee.

770
00:58:31,392 --> 00:58:34,919
Ravi! Ravi! Come here!

771
00:58:38,633 --> 00:58:40,692
What happened, Ram brother?
- Saw that, Ravi?

772
00:58:40,802 --> 00:58:43,566
What happened? - This is known
as the Goddess of the house.

773
00:58:43,671 --> 00:58:45,571
The house that has such a woman...

774
00:58:45,673 --> 00:58:47,231
...that house becomes a temple.

775
00:58:47,609 --> 00:58:51,739
Enough! Enough praise for today.
Have this coffee.

776
00:58:51,846 --> 00:58:53,245
Don't you want to go to the office?

777
00:58:53,348 --> 00:58:54,576
And listen, after drinking coffee...

778
00:58:54,682 --> 00:58:55,910
...go to the bathroom directly.

779
00:58:56,017 --> 00:58:57,279
Warm water is waiting for you.

780
00:58:57,385 --> 00:58:59,580
And breakfast?
- Even that is ready.

781
00:58:59,687 --> 00:59:01,154
Even we both are ready.
Simultaneously.

782
00:59:01,689 --> 00:59:04,624
No. Not like this. First me!

783
00:59:13,034 --> 00:59:14,092
Wow!

784
00:59:15,637 --> 00:59:17,332
First time lunch cooked at home.

785
00:59:17,438 --> 00:59:20,669
Call this breakfast. Lunch
is in the canteen.

786
00:59:20,775 --> 00:59:24,609
Come, ma'am. Feed me with your
hands. It will be great.

787
00:59:24,712 --> 00:59:29,046
Not ma'am, call her
the provider of food!

788
00:59:32,654 --> 00:59:33,848
What happened?

789
00:59:35,657 --> 00:59:39,650
Oh God! You are great!
You starved me!

790
00:59:39,761 --> 00:59:41,160
I got him married!

791
00:59:41,262 --> 00:59:44,629
But still the same 'ldli
Sambar' in my fate.

792
00:59:44,732 --> 00:59:47,758
What do I do, brother? I only
know how to cook this.

793
00:59:48,069 --> 00:59:50,902
I will not spare you!

794
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:56,742
I ask you! Yesterday I had bought
flat plate and rolling pin!

795
00:59:56,844 --> 00:59:58,641
Why did I get it? To cook you!

796
00:59:58,813 --> 01:00:02,681
Ravi, I need a leave of 4 days.
- You want to go home?

797
01:00:02,784 --> 01:00:06,083
No, I will teach this girl
how to cook Punjabi food.

798
01:00:06,187 --> 01:00:08,280
Then your leave is sanctioned.
- Thank you, sir.

799
01:00:08,389 --> 01:00:11,256
But afternoon lunch will be
here only. Come with me.

800
01:00:19,734 --> 01:00:21,702
What are you doing? Why are
you putting salt in this?

801
01:00:21,803 --> 01:00:23,828
This is sweet dish.
- Sweet dish?

802
01:00:23,938 --> 01:00:25,872
Yes, this is a sweet dish,
not some savoury.

803
01:00:27,709 --> 01:00:29,734
Great Punjabi food!

804
01:00:30,712 --> 01:00:33,374
I feel like I have come in some inn.

805
01:00:33,481 --> 01:00:35,676
This is not an inn. It is a house.

806
01:00:35,783 --> 01:00:36,841
And this is food cooked at home.

807
01:00:42,757 --> 01:00:44,019
He calls it an inn!

808
01:00:46,728 --> 01:00:52,860
It is Punjabi too! But...
- What?

809
01:00:52,967 --> 01:00:54,696
Shall I tell you?
- Yes.

810
01:00:54,802 --> 01:00:56,963
Shall I tell you the truth?
- Yes.

811
01:00:57,071 --> 01:01:00,404
It smells just like 'ldli Sambar'.

812
01:01:01,776 --> 01:01:03,710
Again you reminded me!

813
01:01:03,811 --> 01:01:07,110
I am saying the truth! Something
is surely lacking.

814
01:01:07,215 --> 01:01:10,207
What?
- I will tell you. Let me think.

815
01:01:13,888 --> 01:01:15,947
I understood.
- What?

816
01:01:16,057 --> 01:01:19,424
Lata... come with me.

817
01:01:19,761 --> 01:01:20,921
What happened to him?

818
01:01:21,028 --> 01:01:25,965
Till the time we don't return,
don't even sniff the food.

819
01:01:40,815 --> 01:01:41,975
Ram brother.

820
01:01:42,917 --> 01:01:46,114
Come. What are you looking at?
- What happened?

821
01:01:46,854 --> 01:01:49,948
Come! Why are you feeling shy?

822
01:01:57,932 --> 01:02:00,230
Wow! Wow!

823
01:02:00,334 --> 01:02:02,427
Now it is perfect.

824
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:14,147
Look at the guy!

825
01:02:14,248 --> 01:02:16,910
He has grown his side
hairs like grass!

826
01:02:17,018 --> 01:02:20,044
I don't like it.
- Keep quiet.

827
01:02:20,154 --> 01:02:22,315
Why are you telling
me to keep quiet!

828
01:02:31,432 --> 01:02:32,660
Father.

829
01:02:34,035 --> 01:02:37,664
Go in.
- But why? Is the show over?

830
01:02:41,008 --> 01:02:46,412
Do you like her? - I like her!
I like her! The younger sister!

831
01:02:47,849 --> 01:02:52,843
Keep quiet! If you marry here,
then you will get enough dowry!

832
01:02:54,121 --> 01:02:57,716
Look, my son likes the girl.

833
01:02:57,825 --> 01:03:00,760
I have found her. Why
will he not like her?

834
01:03:01,762 --> 01:03:03,696
I have some conditions.

835
01:03:03,798 --> 01:03:06,096
If that is fulfilled, then
the alliance will be fixed.

836
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:08,327
Tell me. What are the conditions?

837
01:03:10,805 --> 01:03:14,707
Look, the jewellery should
weigh 500 Tolas.

838
01:03:14,809 --> 01:03:17,403
And it should be heavy.
- I accept it.

839
01:03:17,511 --> 01:03:21,777
Necklace, bangles, earrings,
everything...

840
01:03:21,883 --> 01:03:23,282
...should be made from pure gold.

841
01:03:23,384 --> 01:03:24,408
I accept it.

842
01:03:24,518 --> 01:03:25,712
Lala-ji, along with these dowries...

843
01:03:25,820 --> 01:03:29,119
...we should get some cash too.

844
01:03:29,290 --> 01:03:35,786
Not much, only 1 lakh. And... even
your bungalow is very nice.

845
01:03:35,897 --> 01:03:37,194
Am I right, Purohit-ji?

846
01:03:37,365 --> 01:03:40,198
It is futile to twist words.

847
01:03:40,301 --> 01:03:43,759
Tell him to sell the clothes
on his body too.

848
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:45,805
And after shaving his head,
leave this house.

849
01:03:45,907 --> 01:03:49,741
Look, if I had only 1 daughter...

850
01:03:49,844 --> 01:03:52,142
...then I would have
accepted that too.

851
01:03:52,246 --> 01:03:57,377
But I have 1 more daughter. I
have to get her married too.

852
01:03:57,485 --> 01:04:00,215
Lala-ji, why are you
so worried about her?

853
01:04:00,321 --> 01:04:01,413
What do you mean?

854
01:04:01,522 --> 01:04:06,152
I mean if the stuff is good, then
the deal can be easily made.

855
01:04:06,260 --> 01:04:08,091
You mean to say that
my elder daughter...

856
01:04:08,195 --> 01:04:11,255
Don't be angry, Lala! Purohit
told us everything.

857
01:04:11,365 --> 01:04:12,798
What did you tell him?

858
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:17,394
I told him what the goons
in the whole city say.

859
01:04:17,805 --> 01:04:21,002
So you think those goons
are saying the truth?

860
01:04:21,108 --> 01:04:24,339
Daddy... come here for a moment.

861
01:04:24,445 --> 01:04:28,108
I am coming.
- No, first come here.

862
01:04:34,121 --> 01:04:35,520
What is this, daddy?

863
01:04:35,823 --> 01:04:38,291
You are saying yes for
all his conditions.

864
01:04:38,392 --> 01:04:43,955
Sister won't be happy in such
greedy people's house.

865
01:04:44,065 --> 01:04:46,863
I don't like this alliance.

866
01:04:47,234 --> 01:04:52,297
Go and refuse them.
- If they too go away...

867
01:04:52,406 --> 01:04:57,309
Remain seated! Please, sit.
Daddy will be here soon.

868
01:04:57,411 --> 01:04:59,242
She even laughs.

869
01:05:01,916 --> 01:05:04,350
What are you thinking, daddy! Go!

870
01:05:06,220 --> 01:05:09,383
No, dear. You only go and tell them.

871
01:05:15,129 --> 01:05:16,926
My sister has prepared this sweet.

872
01:05:17,031 --> 01:05:19,864
I only know how to eat,
like you guys.

873
01:05:21,202 --> 01:05:22,999
Sister, go inside.

874
01:05:23,104 --> 01:05:25,834
Why? Didn't you make this sweet?

875
01:05:25,940 --> 01:05:30,036
I said go in! - Fine, I am going.
Why are you scolding me!

876
01:05:33,948 --> 01:05:38,385
Listen, father says that we
don't like this alliance.

877
01:05:38,486 --> 01:05:40,283
You guys can leave.

878
01:05:40,888 --> 01:05:46,849
Dear, listen. Tell, Lala
that we can bargain.

879
01:05:46,961 --> 01:05:49,862
Purohit, take them away!

880
01:05:51,932 --> 01:05:52,956
Come.

881
01:06:12,953 --> 01:06:16,184
What is this! Again
the same behaviour!

882
01:06:16,957 --> 01:06:18,481
At least look at the time.

883
01:06:18,959 --> 01:06:22,326
The time is perfect. It is midnight.

884
01:06:22,430 --> 01:06:25,957
The time of love. But why
is your mood spoilt?

885
01:06:26,067 --> 01:06:27,159
What's the matter?

886
01:06:28,002 --> 01:06:32,200
Ram brother.
- Ram brother! What happened?

887
01:06:32,406 --> 01:06:34,067
You are asking, what happened?

888
01:06:34,175 --> 01:06:36,939
It is midnight and he has
still not come home.

889
01:06:37,044 --> 01:06:38,602
Even his food is lying untouched.

890
01:06:39,113 --> 01:06:41,513
And this is not happening
for the first time.

891
01:06:41,949 --> 01:06:43,416
This has been going
on since many days.

892
01:06:50,958 --> 01:06:56,225
I think he deliberately
comes home late. - Why?

893
01:06:56,330 --> 01:06:58,628
Because we are newly married couple.

894
01:07:00,101 --> 01:07:04,936
Sometimes I feel like I have made
a mistake by marrying you.

895
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:07,200
Mistake?
- Yes, Lata.

896
01:07:07,441 --> 01:07:09,932
Since the time we have got married...

897
01:07:10,044 --> 01:07:11,944
...he is going away from me.

898
01:07:12,346 --> 01:07:15,975
If I had to marry, then I shouldn't
have done it alone.

899
01:07:16,083 --> 01:07:18,074
We should have got married
at the same time.

900
01:07:19,019 --> 01:07:20,953
For the sake of husband
and wife's love...

901
01:07:21,055 --> 01:07:23,649
...he is sacrificing
love of friendship.

902
01:07:24,125 --> 01:07:26,958
Your brother is so big-hearted.

903
01:07:27,394 --> 01:07:31,057
Not only that. He has
the heart of a child.

904
01:07:31,999 --> 01:07:35,457
Now look at me. I have recently
entered in his life.

905
01:07:36,137 --> 01:07:38,970
But he loves me so much...
not even my...

906
01:07:39,073 --> 01:07:41,098
...real brother will love me so much.

907
01:07:41,342 --> 01:07:46,279
When I see him worried,
I become tense.

908
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:50,007
The person who meets him once,
he wins his heart.

909
01:07:50,351 --> 01:07:52,717
Then let us do one thing.
- What?

910
01:07:52,820 --> 01:07:55,380
Why don't we get Ram brother
married immediately?

911
01:07:55,489 --> 01:07:57,480
I will search for a
girl tomorrow only.

912
01:07:57,591 --> 01:07:59,422
She should be so pretty, so pretty...

913
01:07:59,527 --> 01:08:00,619
Shall I tell you?

914
01:08:00,728 --> 01:08:05,028
She is so pretty like Ram brother.

915
01:08:19,780 --> 01:08:24,046
God... let them always remain happy!

916
01:08:24,218 --> 01:08:27,210
The same laughter, the same love.

917
01:11:12,219 --> 01:11:14,881
"Let me tell you an
imperative thing."

918
01:11:14,988 --> 01:11:17,354
"Listen to me, comrade."

919
01:11:20,394 --> 01:11:23,192
"Let me tell you an
imperative thing."

920
01:11:23,297 --> 01:11:25,629
"Listen to me, comrade."

921
01:11:25,733 --> 01:11:30,830
"The best and the loveliest
is the language of love."

922
01:11:30,938 --> 01:11:33,805
"Let me tell you an
imperative thing."

923
01:11:33,907 --> 01:11:36,341
"Listen to me, comrade."

924
01:11:36,443 --> 01:11:41,574
"The best and the loveliest
is the language of love."

925
01:12:09,009 --> 01:12:13,742
"This life is not a battle,
it is a game."

926
01:12:13,847 --> 01:12:19,251
"Don't talk bitterly. Talk sweetly."

927
01:12:19,353 --> 01:12:24,518
"This life is not a battle,
it is a game."

928
01:12:24,625 --> 01:12:29,824
"Don't talk bitterly. Talk sweetly."

929
01:12:29,997 --> 01:12:34,593
"Bitter talks..."

930
01:12:35,369 --> 01:12:40,705
"Bitter talks strike the
heart like bullets."

931
01:12:40,908 --> 01:12:46,278
"The best and the loveliest
is the language of love."

932
01:12:46,380 --> 01:12:48,940
"Let me tell you an
imperative thing."

933
01:12:49,049 --> 01:12:51,415
"Listen to me, comrade."

934
01:12:51,518 --> 01:12:56,888
"The best and the loveliest
is the language of love."

935
01:13:21,415 --> 01:13:23,781
"What is east and west?"

936
01:13:23,884 --> 01:13:26,318
"What is north and south?"

937
01:13:32,092 --> 01:13:34,686
"What is east and west?"

938
01:13:34,795 --> 01:13:36,786
"What is north and south?"

939
01:13:36,897 --> 01:13:40,333
"We all are birds belonging
to the same garden."

940
01:13:40,434 --> 01:13:42,425
"We are from the same garden."

941
01:13:42,636 --> 01:13:47,972
"We all are one..."

942
01:13:48,175 --> 01:13:53,340
"We all are one. Then why
to make separate troupe?"

943
01:13:53,447 --> 01:13:58,680
"The best and the loveliest
is the language of love."

944
01:13:58,785 --> 01:14:01,583
"Let me tell you an
imperative thing."

945
01:14:01,688 --> 01:14:04,020
"Listen to me, comrade."

946
01:14:04,191 --> 01:14:09,458
"The best and the loveliest
is the language of love."

947
01:14:42,496 --> 01:14:47,399
Yes, hello. Who is this?
Ravi... tell me.

948
01:14:48,468 --> 01:14:54,134
What? You will be late?
Movie with Lata?

949
01:14:54,474 --> 01:14:55,907
No, we all will go tomorrow.

950
01:14:57,511 --> 01:14:59,445
She has already bought the ticket?

951
01:15:00,514 --> 01:15:04,416
Fine. Then I will have
to go with her. Okay.

952
01:15:06,553 --> 01:15:11,149
"Don't ever break this bond."

953
01:15:11,258 --> 01:15:16,457
"So what if you forsake
the whole world."

954
01:15:16,563 --> 01:15:18,827
"My brother..."

955
01:15:18,932 --> 01:15:23,869
"My brother, fulfil the
relation of a brother."

956
01:15:23,971 --> 01:15:29,136
"My brother, don't forget
your younger sister."

957
01:15:29,242 --> 01:15:30,937
"My brother..."

958
01:15:35,549 --> 01:15:40,452
'Take this. Now go and tie Rakhi
to your Shekhar brother too.'

959
01:15:47,594 --> 01:15:50,461
'What happened?
- I have come to tie Rakhi.'

960
01:15:50,564 --> 01:15:52,589
'I don't have time for useless
things. I am leaving.'

961
01:15:52,699 --> 01:15:55,691
'No, brother. This is the
prayers of a sister.'

962
01:15:55,802 --> 01:15:57,463
'Lf the brother doesn't tie Rakhi,
though he has a sister...

963
01:15:57,571 --> 01:16:00,199
...then it is considered
inauspicious.'

964
01:16:00,307 --> 01:16:01,501
'Let it be! '

965
01:16:09,583 --> 01:16:11,483
Did you like the movie?

966
01:16:11,585 --> 01:16:12,643
Tears brimmed in my eyes,
seeing the love...

967
01:16:12,753 --> 01:16:14,152
...between a brother and a sister.

968
01:16:14,688 --> 01:16:17,486
Do you know who the director
is? Prasad from Madras.

969
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:20,624
If the feeling is true, then no
matter where the director is from...

970
01:16:20,727 --> 01:16:22,490
...it has the same effect.

971
01:16:22,929 --> 01:16:25,022
Will you have something to drink?
- No.

972
01:16:25,132 --> 01:16:26,497
I will just come.

973
01:16:38,612 --> 01:16:39,636
What did I tell you?

974
01:16:39,746 --> 01:16:43,045
Now you saw both of them.
Sitting besides each other.

975
01:16:43,150 --> 01:16:44,174
This is the limit!

976
01:16:44,284 --> 01:16:47,549
An ordinary peon with
his superior's wife!

977
01:16:47,654 --> 01:16:49,781
That too in a theatre...
where there is no light.

978
01:16:49,890 --> 01:16:51,983
Not only this. I have seen
them at many places.

979
01:16:52,092 --> 01:16:53,525
Both of them making love.

980
01:16:53,627 --> 01:16:56,755
That manager is a strange
guy! Is he blind?

981
01:16:57,631 --> 01:17:00,065
Maybe both of them are fooling him.

982
01:17:00,167 --> 01:17:01,828
One of them, by his charade
of friendship.

983
01:17:01,935 --> 01:17:02,959
And the other, by charade of love.

984
01:17:10,644 --> 01:17:15,104
"I am your old lover."

985
01:17:15,215 --> 01:17:17,740
The girl is so sly.

986
01:17:17,851 --> 01:17:19,876
The girl is not sly. You are a fool.

987
01:17:19,986 --> 01:17:21,248
What did you say? I am a fool?

988
01:17:21,354 --> 01:17:25,586
Yes. Is this the way to love?
Openly? - I don't understand.

989
01:17:25,692 --> 01:17:30,595
Listen, learn it from the
peon of our office, Ram.

990
01:17:30,697 --> 01:17:32,096
Why? What has he done?

991
01:17:32,265 --> 01:17:34,563
He aided his friend to secure the
post of an assistant manager.

992
01:17:34,668 --> 01:17:36,568
Then he got him married to Lata.

993
01:17:36,670 --> 01:17:43,633
And now... now he is flirting
with his friend's wife.

994
01:17:43,744 --> 01:17:47,578
Oh God! But who told you this?

995
01:17:47,681 --> 01:17:50,309
Shankar... his friends.
- Really?

996
01:17:50,417 --> 01:17:53,648
Yes. We saw both of them
together in the theatre.

997
01:17:53,754 --> 01:17:56,279
What was going on in the theatre!

998
01:17:56,389 --> 01:17:58,584
Both were embracing each other.

999
01:18:03,663 --> 01:18:04,925
You!

1000
01:18:06,233 --> 01:18:08,929
Tell me! Tell me!

1001
01:18:09,035 --> 01:18:10,593
You dare to talk like this!

1002
01:18:16,676 --> 01:18:18,610
You talk like this about
a decent girl!

1003
01:18:20,814 --> 01:18:21,838
You!

1004
01:18:23,717 --> 01:18:27,619
Ram, enough!
- Leave me! Leave me!

1005
01:18:27,721 --> 01:18:30,121
Ram! Ram!
- Leave me! Leave me!

1006
01:18:30,223 --> 01:18:31,918
Ram, enough!

1007
01:18:32,025 --> 01:18:33,822
Uncle, you heard what nonsense
he was uttering!

1008
01:18:33,927 --> 01:18:36,657
Everybody heard it. - Why is he
talking like this about a decent girl!

1009
01:18:36,763 --> 01:18:40,221
He was inviting his troubles! - But
Ram, whose mouth will you shut?

1010
01:18:44,738 --> 01:18:46,638
Everybody talks like this.

1011
01:18:46,740 --> 01:18:49,106
The world is such!

1012
01:18:49,209 --> 01:18:54,237
People will blame you, even
if it is not your fault.

1013
01:18:54,681 --> 01:18:57,912
So I say, why to give
them the chance?

1014
01:19:12,433 --> 01:19:14,697
Brother, how come you have
come so early today?

1015
01:19:14,802 --> 01:19:15,826
To leave.

1016
01:19:27,882 --> 01:19:31,750
Brother! What is going on?
- Our happiness lies in this!

1017
01:19:31,853 --> 01:19:35,380
No, no. I won't let you go.
- Lata, go away from here.

1018
01:19:35,490 --> 01:19:36,980
No, brother. - Didn't you hear!
Go away from here!

1019
01:19:42,163 --> 01:19:43,721
Lata, what happened to your brother?

1020
01:19:43,831 --> 01:19:44,889
Why is he yelling so much?

1021
01:19:44,999 --> 01:19:47,297
I don't know. He is throwing
his clothes in the suitcase.

1022
01:19:47,402 --> 01:19:48,892
When I asked him, he yelled at me.

1023
01:19:49,003 --> 01:19:50,231
He yelled at you?

1024
01:19:59,847 --> 01:20:03,783
Ravi... I am going.
- Where?

1025
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:07,246
I had planned to leave
without informing you.

1026
01:20:07,522 --> 01:20:11,458
But my heart didn't permit me.
Now don't try to stop me.

1027
01:20:11,559 --> 01:20:12,992
Just tell me, where are you going?

1028
01:20:13,094 --> 01:20:17,861
Nowhere! Nowhere! I will
be in this city itself.

1029
01:20:18,833 --> 01:20:22,064
If I want to meet you, then
I will come to the office.

1030
01:20:23,838 --> 01:20:26,773
If I want to meet Lata,
then I will meet her...

1031
01:20:26,874 --> 01:20:29,138
...when she goes out with you.

1032
01:20:30,979 --> 01:20:36,508
Ram... why are you
hurting us so much?

1033
01:20:37,151 --> 01:20:39,779
For what crime are you punishing us?

1034
01:20:39,887 --> 01:20:41,149
What do I tell you?

1035
01:20:41,255 --> 01:20:44,315
Hitherto they used to
say that they doubt it.

1036
01:20:44,425 --> 01:20:47,792
But today... today they
said before everybody.

1037
01:20:47,895 --> 01:20:50,022
That this is not a doubt,
it is the truth.

1038
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:55,260
Why are you talking like a kid,
though you are so sensible?

1039
01:20:55,370 --> 01:20:57,895
Somebody talked rubbish
and you started crying.

1040
01:20:58,006 --> 01:20:59,439
You are talking rubbish, fool!

1041
01:20:59,974 --> 01:21:01,805
If you had been in my
place, then you...

1042
01:21:01,909 --> 01:21:02,967
...would have committed suicide!

1043
01:21:03,077 --> 01:21:04,169
Do you know what they say?

1044
01:21:04,912 --> 01:21:07,813
They say that I aided you to secure
the post of a manager...

1045
01:21:07,915 --> 01:21:11,510
...so that Lata and I... Lata and I...

1046
01:21:17,892 --> 01:21:19,951
Ram! Get up! Get up!

1047
01:21:20,061 --> 01:21:22,825
Who will not feel infuriated
to hear such things! - Then?

1048
01:21:22,930 --> 01:21:26,957
Ram, remember. When you had first
mentioned about the job...

1049
01:21:27,068 --> 01:21:28,933
...I knew nothing about it.

1050
01:21:29,037 --> 01:21:30,834
I did not even know that there
is a female named Lata...

1051
01:21:30,938 --> 01:21:32,838
...working in your office, whether
fair or dark skinned.

1052
01:21:32,940 --> 01:21:36,273
Let them talk rubbish! We
know the truth, don't we?

1053
01:21:36,377 --> 01:21:37,571
There is a different place for
the truth and the world.

1054
01:21:37,678 --> 01:21:40,238
What are you trying to say? - We
have to live in this world! - So?

1055
01:21:40,348 --> 01:21:41,508
Then we have to fear it.

1056
01:21:42,917 --> 01:21:46,182
Then the whole fault lies in
this beautiful world. - Yes.

1057
01:21:46,387 --> 01:21:48,855
Then you can't fight
this cruel world?

1058
01:21:49,891 --> 01:21:50,915
Fine!

1059
01:21:51,959 --> 01:21:56,862
Take this and go away! Go away!

1060
01:21:56,964 --> 01:21:59,865
What! You yourself are telling
brother to leave this place!

1061
01:21:59,967 --> 01:22:01,594
Lata, he can't stay here
even for a moment.

1062
01:22:01,702 --> 01:22:04,000
Why are you standing here! Go away!

1063
01:22:04,105 --> 01:22:06,869
No, no! I won't let you go!
Don't go, brother.

1064
01:22:06,974 --> 01:22:08,407
For my sake, don't go!

1065
01:22:08,509 --> 01:22:10,875
No, Lata! You don't understand!

1066
01:22:10,978 --> 01:22:13,879
It is better if I go away
from here! I will go away!

1067
01:22:13,981 --> 01:22:16,916
Forgot what you told father?

1068
01:22:17,018 --> 01:22:21,182
That you will stay with me for the
rest of your life... as a shadow.

1069
01:22:21,289 --> 01:22:25,919
As my brother. And today you are
leaving your younger sister!

1070
01:22:26,027 --> 01:22:30,896
Lata! Don't stop him! Let
him go! Go away from here!

1071
01:22:30,998 --> 01:22:33,899
No, no! He says that he
is afraid of the world.

1072
01:22:34,001 --> 01:22:36,333
And you want to push him in
the same world all alone!

1073
01:22:36,437 --> 01:22:37,631
He is talking rubbish!

1074
01:22:38,005 --> 01:22:39,905
Once upon a time when I
was afraid of the world...

1075
01:22:40,007 --> 01:22:42,271
...he had supported me.

1076
01:22:42,443 --> 01:22:46,174
And today... today he is showing
the fear of the same world.

1077
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:48,510
But the truth is something
else, Lata!

1078
01:22:48,616 --> 01:22:51,517
He is not afraid of the world,
he is afraid of himself!

1079
01:22:51,619 --> 01:22:57,080
What! - Yes, you are afraid that
if you stay in this house...

1080
01:22:57,191 --> 01:23:01,651
...then you might do what the
world accuses you of! - Ravi!

1081
01:23:04,999 --> 01:23:07,365
What did you say! You were
talking about whom!

1082
01:23:07,468 --> 01:23:09,333
Do you know in front of
whom you are talking!

1083
01:23:10,138 --> 01:23:12,936
If you say that you will
go away from here...

1084
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:14,940
...then I will continue to say...

1085
01:23:15,042 --> 01:23:18,205
Try to say it!
- You are leaving because...

1086
01:23:20,047 --> 01:23:22,982
Speak up! Speak up! Say this again!

1087
01:23:23,084 --> 01:23:24,984
First you say that you
won't leave this house!

1088
01:23:25,086 --> 01:23:27,987
Ravi, I will kill you!
I will kill you!

1089
01:23:28,089 --> 01:23:31,388
If you don't stop being
stubborn then I will...

1090
01:23:31,492 --> 01:23:36,657
Brother! Brother! Brother!
Tell him that you won't go!

1091
01:23:37,064 --> 01:23:39,430
No! I will surely go!
I will surely go!

1092
01:23:39,534 --> 01:23:42,970
And I will shout and say! I will
tell to the whole world...

1093
01:23:43,070 --> 01:23:46,005
No, Ravi! Keep quiet! Keep quiet!

1094
01:23:50,411 --> 01:23:51,503
Brother!

1095
01:23:51,612 --> 01:23:55,013
No, I won't go! I will
not go anywhere!

1096
01:23:56,083 --> 01:23:59,541
If death comes, still I won't
go! I will not go anywhere!

1097
01:23:59,654 --> 01:24:04,387
I will not leave you and my younger
sister! I will not go!

1098
01:24:04,492 --> 01:24:07,052
I will not go! I will not go!

1099
01:24:09,697 --> 01:24:10,721
Ram!

1100
01:24:13,100 --> 01:24:16,126
"One day, hearing this, Radha
came running..." - Greetings.

1101
01:24:16,370 --> 01:24:21,535
Lawyer! Lawyer! - What is
all this! What is all this!

1102
01:24:21,642 --> 01:24:25,339
Lawyer, you aided us during
our difficult times.

1103
01:24:25,446 --> 01:24:28,006
You fought our case and thus
we got our wealth back.

1104
01:24:28,115 --> 01:24:30,208
We are forever indebted to you.

1105
01:24:31,719 --> 01:24:34,017
You should not praise
a person so much.

1106
01:24:34,121 --> 01:24:38,057
I had told him before only
to leave everything on God.

1107
01:24:38,159 --> 01:24:41,287
Saw the greatness of
my God! Have a seat!

1108
01:24:42,797 --> 01:24:45,288
Lawyer, now our days have improved.

1109
01:24:45,399 --> 01:24:49,495
We want to call back our son.
- And get him married soon.

1110
01:24:49,604 --> 01:24:53,040
Yes. - It is great! Have
you searched for a girl?

1111
01:24:56,510 --> 01:24:59,206
Hello. Shakuntala dear.

1112
01:25:00,214 --> 01:25:05,151
What! Your father has fainted!
I will just come!

1113
01:25:06,120 --> 01:25:08,714
I am in hurry. We will meet later.

1114
01:25:08,823 --> 01:25:10,051
Greetings.
- Greetings.

1115
01:25:13,628 --> 01:25:16,529
What happened? What happened?

1116
01:25:17,164 --> 01:25:22,158
What is this? Dear, on the phone
you said that he has fainted.

1117
01:25:22,270 --> 01:25:25,296
But he is royally
sitting on his bed.

1118
01:25:25,406 --> 01:25:28,534
He is better because of the
injection that the doctor gave him.

1119
01:25:28,643 --> 01:25:30,736
Doctor, what is plaguing him?

1120
01:25:30,845 --> 01:25:32,506
More than ailment, it is the worry.

1121
01:25:32,613 --> 01:25:35,343
Doctor, why don't you understand?

1122
01:25:35,483 --> 01:25:40,386
I can't sleep at night.
- For that I gave you the pills.

1123
01:25:40,488 --> 01:25:46,484
Still I can't sleep well. - Is that
so? I will give another pill.

1124
01:25:49,130 --> 01:25:50,427
Dear, come here.

1125
01:25:55,303 --> 01:26:01,105
Take this. Give this only when
he can't sleep. Just 1 pill.

1126
01:26:01,208 --> 01:26:03,733
What will happen if he
has 2? Will he vomit?

1127
01:26:03,844 --> 01:26:05,835
No, his life will be in danger.

1128
01:26:05,946 --> 01:26:08,540
Oh God! Heard that, Shagun.
Keep it carefully.

1129
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:14,447
Lala-ji, greetings.
- Greetings.

1130
01:26:14,555 --> 01:26:16,113
Take this.
- Thank you.

1131
01:26:16,223 --> 01:26:21,855
Mahadev... what is the worry,
that is plaguing you?

1132
01:26:22,196 --> 01:26:24,255
That there are hurdles
in Kusum's marriage?

1133
01:26:24,365 --> 01:26:26,128
Is this any less.

1134
01:26:27,301 --> 01:26:31,169
Great, uncle! I am not getting
married and he is worried!

1135
01:26:31,272 --> 01:26:33,638
Look at me! I have no worries!

1136
01:26:33,741 --> 01:26:35,333
You are right, dear. You are right.

1137
01:26:35,443 --> 01:26:37,308
Sister, you go in.

1138
01:26:38,346 --> 01:26:40,837
You always say sister, quiet!
Sister, go in! I am leaving.

1139
01:26:41,349 --> 01:26:46,150
Oh God! What should
I do with this girl!

1140
01:26:46,253 --> 01:26:48,221
She doesn't understand anything!

1141
01:26:49,223 --> 01:26:56,152
God, if all girls are immature like
Kusum, then it will be so good.

1142
01:26:58,199 --> 01:27:00,531
I want to tell you one thing.
- What?

1143
01:27:00,634 --> 01:27:05,264
I have a client. Today I won
his case that was very weak.

1144
01:27:05,373 --> 01:27:09,366
It is a good family. They have
a son too. He is educated.

1145
01:27:09,477 --> 01:27:12,640
If you say then I will talk
to them about Kusum.

1146
01:27:12,747 --> 01:27:16,205
They are willing to do
anything that I say.

1147
01:27:16,317 --> 01:27:18,182
They will give their consent.

1148
01:27:18,285 --> 01:27:21,721
But I... am wondering
about Kusum's fate.

1149
01:27:22,223 --> 01:27:25,624
Daddy, you are rejecting
a nice proposal.

1150
01:27:25,726 --> 01:27:28,194
Uncle.
- Yes. - You go ahead.

1151
01:27:28,295 --> 01:27:35,861
I don't mind, but Mahadev...
- Do as you wish.

1152
01:27:44,311 --> 01:27:45,335
Post!

1153
01:27:55,256 --> 01:27:59,215
Brother! Brother!

1154
01:28:00,261 --> 01:28:03,697
What happened? - What happened?
- What happened? - What happened?

1155
01:28:03,798 --> 01:28:06,562
Nothing. There is a
letter for brother.

1156
01:28:06,667 --> 01:28:08,498
It has saffron too.

1157
01:28:08,602 --> 01:28:11,867
Saffron? It implies good news.
Marriage or engagement.

1158
01:28:11,972 --> 01:28:13,234
I will open it!

1159
01:28:14,308 --> 01:28:18,369
No! I will read it!
- Fine, you read it!

1160
01:28:32,293 --> 01:28:33,317
Lata.

1161
01:29:14,335 --> 01:29:18,601
"News has arrived. Listen,
news has arrived."

1162
01:29:18,706 --> 01:29:23,040
"News has arrived. Listen,
news has arrived."

1163
01:29:23,344 --> 01:29:27,508
"Ram is going to get engaged."

1164
01:29:27,615 --> 01:29:31,881
"Ram is going to get engaged."

1165
01:29:32,052 --> 01:29:36,386
"News has arrived. Listen,
news has arrived."

1166
01:29:36,490 --> 01:29:40,824
"News has arrived. Listen,
news has arrived."

1167
01:30:03,050 --> 01:30:07,646
"Fair face. Eyes are gorgeous."

1168
01:30:07,755 --> 01:30:12,089
"Such will be, such will be,
my bhabhi, brother."

1169
01:30:12,192 --> 01:30:14,353
"Short.
- Fat."

1170
01:30:14,461 --> 01:30:16,395
"No, slim."

1171
01:30:16,497 --> 01:30:21,059
"Fair face. Eyes are gorgeous."

1172
01:30:21,168 --> 01:30:25,502
"Such will be, such will be,
my bhabhi, brother."

1173
01:30:25,606 --> 01:30:29,770
"I am sing and dance."

1174
01:30:29,877 --> 01:30:34,371
"I am sing and dance. And
the clarinet will play."

1175
01:30:34,481 --> 01:30:38,611
"News has arrived. Listen,
news has arrived."

1176
01:30:38,719 --> 01:30:43,088
"News has arrived. Listen,
news has arrived."

1177
01:30:43,190 --> 01:30:47,524
"Ram is going to get engaged."

1178
01:30:47,628 --> 01:30:51,997
"Ram is going to get engaged."

1179
01:30:52,099 --> 01:30:56,399
"News has arrived. Listen,
news has arrived."

1180
01:31:23,464 --> 01:31:27,628
"Don't become so crazy
about your wife."

1181
01:31:27,735 --> 01:31:32,104
"Don't let new relations
break the old ones."

1182
01:31:36,877 --> 01:31:40,836
"Don't become so crazy
about your wife."

1183
01:31:40,948 --> 01:31:45,180
"Don't let new relations
break the old ones."

1184
01:31:45,285 --> 01:31:49,619
"Don't forget us. Keep visiting us."

1185
01:31:49,723 --> 01:31:54,092
"Don't give us long separation."

1186
01:31:54,194 --> 01:31:58,460
"News has arrived. Listen,
news has arrived."

1187
01:31:58,565 --> 01:32:02,831
"News has arrived. Listen,
news has arrived."

1188
01:32:02,936 --> 01:32:07,134
"Ram is going to get engaged."

1189
01:32:07,307 --> 01:32:11,539
"Ram is going to get engaged."

1190
01:32:11,645 --> 01:32:15,979
"News has arrived. Listen,
news has arrived."

1191
01:32:33,634 --> 01:32:38,071
"Quickly give us the
result of marriage."

1192
01:32:38,172 --> 01:32:42,541
"My nephew will play
in my lonely house."

1193
01:32:42,643 --> 01:32:45,009
"My sweet one. Dear one."

1194
01:32:45,112 --> 01:32:46,773
"Little one. Sweet child."

1195
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:51,249
"Quickly give us the
result of marriage."

1196
01:32:51,351 --> 01:32:55,720
"My nephew will play
in my lonely house."

1197
01:32:55,823 --> 01:33:00,157
"You will get angry and
the child will wake up."

1198
01:33:00,260 --> 01:33:02,558
"The child will neither
sleep nor play."

1199
01:33:02,663 --> 01:33:04,597
"The child will just
ask for sweets."

1200
01:33:04,698 --> 01:33:08,828
"News has arrived. Listen,
news has arrived."

1201
01:33:08,936 --> 01:33:13,168
"News has arrived. Listen,
news has arrived."

1202
01:33:13,273 --> 01:33:17,573
"Ram is going to get engaged."

1203
01:33:17,678 --> 01:33:21,808
"Ram is going to get engaged."

1204
01:33:21,915 --> 01:33:26,147
"News has arrived. Listen,
news has arrived."

1205
01:33:26,253 --> 01:33:30,553
"News has arrived. Listen,
news has arrived."

1206
01:33:47,975 --> 01:33:50,136
They have just called
me to see the girl.

1207
01:33:50,244 --> 01:33:52,735
And you both have made me a
father and an old man too.

1208
01:33:52,846 --> 01:33:55,644
We did the right thing.
- Yes, brother. Go there.

1209
01:33:55,749 --> 01:33:57,979
No, no. Change your clothes
and go there immediately.

1210
01:33:58,085 --> 01:33:59,575
No, no. I won't go there alone.

1211
01:33:59,686 --> 01:34:00,710
You both will have to come with me.

1212
01:34:00,821 --> 01:34:02,584
It is your task to select the girl.

1213
01:34:02,689 --> 01:34:04,589
My task is just to make
her wear 'Mangalsutra'...

1214
01:34:04,691 --> 01:34:05,715
...that too with closed eyes.

1215
01:34:05,826 --> 01:34:07,293
Ram, I would have surely
gone with you.

1216
01:34:07,394 --> 01:34:10,124
But you know that the general
manager is not here.

1217
01:34:11,365 --> 01:34:14,857
If I too went with you,
then won't they complain?

1218
01:34:14,968 --> 01:34:16,196
You are right.

1219
01:34:17,771 --> 01:34:20,672
Fine, will you do one thing?
- What?

1220
01:34:20,774 --> 01:34:24,801
I will send you a snap of the
girl whom I will see there.

1221
01:34:24,912 --> 01:34:27,608
If you like her, then
write me a letter.

1222
01:34:27,714 --> 01:34:30,274
Your choice and my marriage.
- I accept it.

1223
01:34:30,384 --> 01:34:32,750
Okay. Is it fine, Lata?
- Yes.

1224
01:34:40,994 --> 01:34:43,656
Girl! Girl! Girl! I am tired
of listening to it!

1225
01:34:44,731 --> 01:34:46,028
Listen to one thing carefully!

1226
01:34:46,133 --> 01:34:49,967
The final decision will not be
mine, yours or the lawyer's.

1227
01:34:50,070 --> 01:34:51,128
Then?

1228
01:34:51,238 --> 01:34:53,729
The final decision will be
taken by my friend, Ravi.

1229
01:34:53,841 --> 01:34:56,776
If it is acceptable to you, then
I will go to see the girl.

1230
01:34:56,877 --> 01:34:58,640
Otherwise I will return
to Bangalore.

1231
01:34:58,745 --> 01:35:00,178
Do you hear what he is saying!

1232
01:35:00,280 --> 01:35:03,716
Ram, what rubbish are you talking!
- Father...

1233
01:35:04,751 --> 01:35:08,016
What is your problem if
Ravi takes the decision?

1234
01:35:08,121 --> 01:35:09,645
What if Ravi says something else?

1235
01:35:09,756 --> 01:35:12,156
Possible.
- Father.

1236
01:35:14,094 --> 01:35:18,053
Ravi is his friend. And friends
have same choices.

1237
01:35:18,165 --> 01:35:19,689
Yes! Heard that, mother!

1238
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:24,669
You have gone mad!
- You don't worry.

1239
01:35:27,741 --> 01:35:28,799
Where are you going, son?

1240
01:35:28,909 --> 01:35:30,171
You stopped him while
he was leaving.

1241
01:35:30,277 --> 01:35:32,006
Son, wait for a while.

1242
01:35:32,112 --> 01:35:37,982
"Don't hit me with a marigold
flower, my heart gets wounded..."

1243
01:35:38,085 --> 01:35:40,417
Ram son, come here.

1244
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:41,680
He is my son, Ram.

1245
01:35:41,788 --> 01:35:42,846
Greetings.
- God bless you.

1246
01:35:42,956 --> 01:35:45,686
Son, he is our lawyer,
Narayan Prasad.

1247
01:35:45,792 --> 01:35:46,850
Tomorrow he will show you the girl.

1248
01:35:47,194 --> 01:35:51,153
Look dear, I have surely
won your case.

1249
01:35:51,265 --> 01:35:53,426
But there is no pressure on you.

1250
01:35:53,901 --> 01:35:57,837
Tomorrow you see the girl. If you
like her, then she is yours.

1251
01:35:57,938 --> 01:35:59,906
Otherwise she belongs to her father.

1252
01:36:00,007 --> 01:36:02,066
Fine, I will leave. Greetings.
- God bless you.

1253
01:36:02,743 --> 01:36:06,440
Come here.
- Yes. Have a seat.

1254
01:36:06,780 --> 01:36:08,441
Actually...

1255
01:36:25,933 --> 01:36:28,731
What happened?
- Let me check. Are you in hurry?

1256
01:36:28,835 --> 01:36:31,269
Why would I have taken a cab,
if I was not in hurry?

1257
01:36:36,944 --> 01:36:38,275
What happened!

1258
01:36:39,846 --> 01:36:43,373
The petrol is overflowing!
Now this car won't start!

1259
01:36:43,483 --> 01:36:44,745
But I am in hurry.

1260
01:36:44,851 --> 01:36:48,309
If you are in hurry, then
I will escort you. Come.

1261
01:36:48,422 --> 01:36:51,220
But I and you...
- What are you thinking! Come!

1262
01:36:51,325 --> 01:36:54,817
Think about it, ma'am.
- What is there to think?

1263
01:36:54,928 --> 01:36:56,225
You are alone and he...

1264
01:36:56,330 --> 01:36:58,764
I am alone, he is alone,
you are alone.

1265
01:36:58,865 --> 01:37:00,765
It implies 3 people
alone and this car.

1266
01:37:00,867 --> 01:37:03,802
It implies nobody is alone.
Let's sit! Come on!

1267
01:37:03,904 --> 01:37:07,772
Driver, take this.
- Greetings, sir.

1268
01:37:19,987 --> 01:37:22,785
"The wedding procession will come."

1269
01:37:22,889 --> 01:37:24,948
"The twilight is lovely."

1270
01:37:25,058 --> 01:37:28,289
"I will dance wholeheartedly."

1271
01:37:28,462 --> 01:37:32,398
"I will dance wholeheartedly."

1272
01:37:44,177 --> 01:37:46,338
What happened, driver? Puncture?

1273
01:37:46,446 --> 01:37:49,904
No, the tire has burst.
- Now what? - I will get another.

1274
01:37:50,984 --> 01:37:54,010
Wow! What fate you have!

1275
01:37:54,121 --> 01:37:55,145
You got out of one
tricky situation...

1276
01:37:55,255 --> 01:37:56,244
...and got stuck in another one.

1277
01:37:56,356 --> 01:37:59,325
It happens. But why?

1278
01:37:59,426 --> 01:38:00,984
Ma'am, there is no air
in this one too.

1279
01:38:01,094 --> 01:38:02,118
Now what will you do?

1280
01:38:02,229 --> 01:38:04,823
I will get it filled from the
petrol pump. - Fine. Go.

1281
01:38:04,931 --> 01:38:06,831
But...
- Now what?

1282
01:38:06,933 --> 01:38:08,264
This new stranger...

1283
01:38:08,902 --> 01:38:13,464
Now he is not new, he is old.
Go! What do you think!

1284
01:38:13,573 --> 01:38:14,562
Go away!

1285
01:38:18,912 --> 01:38:21,847
It is too hot! Don't you feel hot?
- Yes. It is so hot.

1286
01:38:22,949 --> 01:38:25,975
Look, there is shade. Let
us go to sit there. Come.

1287
01:38:32,926 --> 01:38:34,860
It feels as if we have
reached Kashmir.

1288
01:38:34,961 --> 01:38:37,862
That is fine. But...
- What do you mean?

1289
01:38:37,964 --> 01:38:40,956
If somebody sees us then
as your driver said...

1290
01:38:41,068 --> 01:38:44,868
You are just like the driver.
- What!

1291
01:38:44,971 --> 01:38:48,099
Why this driver thinks like this?
- What do I know?

1292
01:38:48,208 --> 01:38:50,904
You don't know, do you?
Sit. I will tell you.

1293
01:38:51,978 --> 01:38:57,211
Look, a person resides here. His
name is Bakke. He is a ruffian!

1294
01:38:57,317 --> 01:39:00,582
Why? What did he do?
- He didn't do anything.

1295
01:39:00,687 --> 01:39:01,881
But he declares in the whole city...

1296
01:39:01,988 --> 01:39:03,615
...that he has done something.

1297
01:39:03,723 --> 01:39:07,887
Let him talk.
- But everybody believes him.

1298
01:39:07,994 --> 01:39:10,360
So what! What do you care?

1299
01:39:10,464 --> 01:39:14,298
Wow! You are great! You don't
understand anything.

1300
01:39:14,401 --> 01:39:17,928
What do you know? Now nobody
is willing to marry me.

1301
01:39:18,105 --> 01:39:20,039
Really?
- Yes.

1302
01:39:20,140 --> 01:39:22,904
The guys who come to see
me, they say that...

1303
01:39:23,009 --> 01:39:25,603
...Kusum is so pretty,
I will marry her only.

1304
01:39:25,712 --> 01:39:29,375
And the next day he says,
I will not marry Kusum.

1305
01:39:29,483 --> 01:39:31,246
She is a vagabond and
a characterless person.

1306
01:39:31,351 --> 01:39:33,216
Do you know the reason for this?

1307
01:39:33,453 --> 01:39:36,945
Letters are sent in my
name from this place.

1308
01:39:37,057 --> 01:39:38,183
Is that so?
- Yes.

1309
01:39:38,291 --> 01:39:40,953
That's why daddy cries
when he sees me.

1310
01:39:41,328 --> 01:39:44,627
And that Shagun, she
always scolds me.

1311
01:39:44,965 --> 01:39:47,263
Who is Shagun?
- My younger sister.

1312
01:39:47,367 --> 01:39:49,392
Younger sister?
- Yes.

1313
01:39:49,503 --> 01:39:50,970
Why does she scold you?

1314
01:39:51,071 --> 01:39:55,132
She says that sister, you
openly talk to people.

1315
01:39:55,242 --> 01:39:56,539
That's why your reputation is bad.

1316
01:39:56,643 --> 01:39:58,235
Now you only tell me.

1317
01:39:58,345 --> 01:40:02,179
Is it wrong to openly talk
with everybody? - No.

1318
01:40:02,282 --> 01:40:05,581
Look, I have been talking
to you since a long time.

1319
01:40:05,685 --> 01:40:07,949
Do you think that I am a vagabond?
- No.

1320
01:40:08,054 --> 01:40:11,387
No, am I right? Then why do
people talk rubbish about me?

1321
01:40:13,160 --> 01:40:16,186
Let them talk. What do I care?

1322
01:40:16,296 --> 01:40:18,025
They only are spoiling their name.

1323
01:40:18,265 --> 01:40:24,431
But yes, there is one who
loves me immensely. - Who?

1324
01:40:24,538 --> 01:40:28,304
Moti. - Good! There is someone
who understands you.

1325
01:40:28,408 --> 01:40:30,467
Maybe he will marry you.

1326
01:40:34,681 --> 01:40:37,445
Moti is my dog. What will
he understand these things.

1327
01:40:37,651 --> 01:40:40,211
You are right. He won't
understand these things.

1328
01:40:41,087 --> 01:40:44,318
But why does this Bakke
bad mouth you?

1329
01:40:44,558 --> 01:40:46,992
What do I know? He only
knows the reason.

1330
01:40:47,093 --> 01:40:52,030
But yes, once when we had
gone for picnic then...

1331
01:40:52,132 --> 01:40:57,365
Ma'am! Ma'am! A man is trying
to commit suicide!

1332
01:40:57,470 --> 01:41:01,099
What! - Yes, ma'am! Hurry up!
Otherwise the poor guy will die.

1333
01:41:01,208 --> 01:41:04,302
Did you hear that, Shanti?
Come on, let all of go.

1334
01:41:04,411 --> 01:41:07,005
Have you gone mad! Look, don't go!

1335
01:41:07,113 --> 01:41:08,546
Unnecessarily you will
get into trouble!

1336
01:41:08,648 --> 01:41:12,277
A man is dying and you are saying
I will get into trouble!

1337
01:41:12,385 --> 01:41:13,545
Leave me!

1338
01:41:13,653 --> 01:41:15,553
Stop, Kusum!
- Let's go!

1339
01:41:15,655 --> 01:41:18,021
Look, ma'am. He is hanging himself!

1340
01:41:18,124 --> 01:41:21,025
Hey! What are you doing!
What are you doing!

1341
01:41:22,195 --> 01:41:24,686
What happened? Why
do you want to die?

1342
01:41:26,366 --> 01:41:31,030
Being a grown up man, you
are crying like a child.

1343
01:41:31,137 --> 01:41:34,265
Why will I not cry! Who
told you to save me!

1344
01:41:34,374 --> 01:41:38,174
I wanted to get rid of this
hell by hanging myself!

1345
01:41:38,278 --> 01:41:40,246
Hell? Why? Why?

1346
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:43,608
Don't you see! I belong
to a royal family!

1347
01:41:43,717 --> 01:41:46,208
My father had aided loads of people!

1348
01:41:46,319 --> 01:41:49,049
First he used his own money that
people did not care to return.

1349
01:41:49,155 --> 01:41:51,248
Then he took loan that
he couldn't return.

1350
01:41:51,358 --> 01:41:54,794
One day the government denied
him the title of a King.

1351
01:41:54,894 --> 01:41:58,660
Then what! His image was
slandered and he died!

1352
01:42:00,533 --> 01:42:01,693
Poor fellow!

1353
01:42:02,168 --> 01:42:08,198
Then I also took a loan. 500
rupees. For his funeral.

1354
01:42:08,308 --> 01:42:10,139
Now I can't repay it.

1355
01:42:10,243 --> 01:42:17,672
Debtors are after me. But
my heart doesn't fail.

1356
01:42:17,784 --> 01:42:20,309
That's why I am trying
to commit suicide.

1357
01:42:20,420 --> 01:42:24,083
Hey! You are weird! You are
dying just for 500 rupees.

1358
01:42:24,190 --> 01:42:28,092
Yes! - Listen! What if
you get 500 rupees?

1359
01:42:28,194 --> 01:42:29,786
Then I will be able
to repay my loan.

1360
01:42:29,896 --> 01:42:34,094
Fine! You will get 500 rupees.
- But when?

1361
01:42:34,301 --> 01:42:39,739
You wait here, I will just get
it. Fine? - If you say so.

1362
01:42:40,240 --> 01:42:42,538
And yes, don't die.

1363
01:42:46,146 --> 01:42:48,114
Look, I have come so soon.
Take 500 rupees.

1364
01:42:48,214 --> 01:42:50,114
It is a sin to touch this.

1365
01:42:50,216 --> 01:42:52,116
You give it to him with
your own hands.

1366
01:42:52,218 --> 01:42:53,742
Fine, take this.

1367
01:42:53,853 --> 01:42:56,447
If henceforth you harassed him,
then I will give you a tight slap!

1368
01:42:57,223 --> 01:43:00,124
Sparrow! There!
- Where?

1369
01:43:00,327 --> 01:43:03,728
Wow!
- There is no sparrow there!

1370
01:43:03,830 --> 01:43:09,166
It fluttered away! Thanks
a lot. You aided me.

1371
01:43:09,269 --> 01:43:12,397
Now, I can die peacefully!
- No!

1372
01:43:12,505 --> 01:43:16,134
What is this! You only had said!

1373
01:43:16,242 --> 01:43:18,210
You will not die, if
the loan is repaid.

1374
01:43:18,311 --> 01:43:19,676
So what if the loan is repaid?

1375
01:43:19,779 --> 01:43:23,180
Where will I get money to
feed myself? - By working.

1376
01:43:23,283 --> 01:43:26,150
Oh no! Till the time I
don't get any work...

1377
01:43:26,252 --> 01:43:28,516
...suitable for a royal member,
how will I work?

1378
01:43:28,621 --> 01:43:31,146
Fine, you want money to feed
yourselves, don't you?

1379
01:43:31,257 --> 01:43:33,623
Till the time you don't find work,
I will give you money.

1380
01:43:33,727 --> 01:43:36,161
Then he started coming
everyday to my college.

1381
01:43:36,262 --> 01:43:37,661
To take money from me.

1382
01:43:37,764 --> 01:43:39,891
And do you know what he did one day?

1383
01:43:40,266 --> 01:43:42,700
Take this.
- Kusum!

1384
01:43:43,269 --> 01:43:48,764
You have satiated my hunger.
Now I am thirsty.

1385
01:43:48,875 --> 01:43:51,207
Then drink water.
- No, Kusum.

1386
01:43:51,378 --> 01:43:55,178
This thirst won't quench by this.
- Then?

1387
01:43:55,281 --> 01:43:59,240
It can be quenched by
only one thing. - What?

1388
01:43:59,352 --> 01:44:02,913
By the meeting of lips.

1389
01:44:03,022 --> 01:44:06,185
Go away! I will give
you a tight slap!

1390
01:44:06,292 --> 01:44:07,884
Hey! The consequence
will be very bad!

1391
01:44:07,994 --> 01:44:12,363
I will also say what the
people say. - My foot!

1392
01:44:12,465 --> 01:44:15,764
Hey! Think about it! Later
on don't complain!

1393
01:44:15,869 --> 01:44:19,202
I will talk such things about you...

1394
01:44:19,305 --> 01:44:23,207
...that you will remain unmarried.

1395
01:44:23,410 --> 01:44:25,207
Since then it has been going on.

1396
01:44:25,311 --> 01:44:29,907
He has told so many lies that
nobody is willing to marry me now.

1397
01:44:31,384 --> 01:44:35,616
Can I ask you one thing? Why does
he talk like this about me?

1398
01:44:35,722 --> 01:44:37,747
Not about you.
- Then?

1399
01:44:37,857 --> 01:44:40,223
He knows that you are very naiee.

1400
01:44:40,326 --> 01:44:42,226
That's why he is taking
advantage of that.

1401
01:44:42,328 --> 01:44:46,788
And our mad world believes him.

1402
01:44:49,302 --> 01:44:51,236
Come on! The car has arrived!

1403
01:44:51,337 --> 01:44:53,965
No. You go. I will go on my own.

1404
01:44:54,274 --> 01:44:57,766
You are so weird! There you were
saying that you are in hurry!

1405
01:45:00,280 --> 01:45:01,679
I understood!

1406
01:45:01,781 --> 01:45:03,248
You think that even your reputation
will become bad...

1407
01:45:03,349 --> 01:45:05,977
...if you come with me.

1408
01:45:06,085 --> 01:45:09,248
No, no. This is not so. I
can never think like this.

1409
01:45:09,756 --> 01:45:13,715
Then it is fine. Can I leave?
- Thank you. - Bye!

1410
01:45:23,369 --> 01:45:26,566
Greetings. We are fortunate
that you have come.

1411
01:45:26,673 --> 01:45:28,265
Daddy will be here soon.

1412
01:45:28,374 --> 01:45:31,309
No problem. Let him take his own
time. We are not in hurry.

1413
01:45:35,482 --> 01:45:40,510
Laxmi, lawyer was saying that the
girl has a younger sister too.

1414
01:45:40,620 --> 01:45:41,814
She must be the one.

1415
01:45:42,455 --> 01:45:46,323
Yes, she is so young but
so sensible. - Really.

1416
01:46:02,509 --> 01:46:03,703
I am sorry.

1417
01:46:05,345 --> 01:46:06,972
The tea spilled.

1418
01:46:07,080 --> 01:46:09,446
It is only tea. So
what if it spilled.

1419
01:46:10,483 --> 01:46:12,348
It slipped from my hand.

1420
01:46:13,353 --> 01:46:15,321
If it had not slipped, then
how would it have spilled?

1421
01:46:15,421 --> 01:46:17,821
You are right.
- That is what I am saying.

1422
01:46:23,863 --> 01:46:27,560
What drama is this! Again
you are sleeping!

1423
01:46:27,667 --> 01:46:28,895
Come downstairs.

1424
01:46:29,002 --> 01:46:31,368
What will I do downstairs?
- Do come!

1425
01:46:32,438 --> 01:46:34,929
You only go and talk to her!

1426
01:46:35,041 --> 01:46:38,408
Daddy! Daddy, what do I
tell you about the guy!

1427
01:46:38,511 --> 01:46:42,345
So nice! Just don't ask!

1428
01:46:42,448 --> 01:46:46,612
The tea spilled from my hand
and fell on his clothes!

1429
01:46:46,719 --> 01:46:53,352
What? - But he was not worried.
He said so what if it fell?

1430
01:46:53,459 --> 01:46:58,396
It is only tea. He spoke
so decently and politely.

1431
01:46:58,498 --> 01:47:02,400
As if he is already married.
- This is the sad thing, dear.

1432
01:47:02,502 --> 01:47:05,403
The matter that is almost fixed,
in the end it gets ruined.

1433
01:47:06,472 --> 01:47:08,633
This is your problem!

1434
01:47:08,908 --> 01:47:13,538
Dear, you go and bring sister. I
will just bring your daddy. Go.

1435
01:47:14,614 --> 01:47:18,482
Look, you have to act
courageously. Come.

1436
01:47:20,453 --> 01:47:21,511
I don't feel up to it.

1437
01:47:22,488 --> 01:47:27,858
At least go downstairs once.
Get up. Come on.

1438
01:47:27,961 --> 01:47:31,692
But... but one thing.

1439
01:47:32,565 --> 01:47:39,698
If this time too the same thing
happens... then I will kill myself.

1440
01:47:58,791 --> 01:47:59,849
Mahadev!

1441
01:47:59,959 --> 01:48:02,427
Mahadev! He is the guy's father.

1442
01:48:02,528 --> 01:48:05,429
Greetings.
- She is the guy's mother.

1443
01:48:05,531 --> 01:48:09,433
Greetings.
- And he is the guy, Ram Chandra.

1444
01:48:09,535 --> 01:48:12,595
Greetings.
- Greetings.

1445
01:48:12,705 --> 01:48:16,607
And he is the girl's father.
Mahadev Prasad.

1446
01:48:16,709 --> 01:48:18,574
Sit.
- Have a seat.

1447
01:48:21,481 --> 01:48:22,675
One moment.

1448
01:48:23,516 --> 01:48:26,713
Forgive me.
- We will just come.

1449
01:48:30,556 --> 01:48:33,821
Mahadev! Now what?
- The guy is very nice.

1450
01:48:34,527 --> 01:48:37,587
It seems maybe Shakuntala
was right after all.

1451
01:48:38,498 --> 01:48:42,161
Why this maybe!

1452
01:48:44,637 --> 01:48:50,473
Mahadev, don't worry. Leave
everything on God.

1453
01:48:50,576 --> 01:48:52,476
He will make everything fine.

1454
01:48:52,578 --> 01:48:53,909
I will just come.

1455
01:48:55,515 --> 01:48:57,483
Shakuntala.
- Yes.

1456
01:48:57,583 --> 01:49:00,746
You are ready?
- Yes. Shall I bring sister?

1457
01:49:00,853 --> 01:49:06,223
Not now. Kusum, the
guy is very nice.

1458
01:49:07,593 --> 01:49:11,495
He is educated and very polite.
I like him a lot.

1459
01:49:12,565 --> 01:49:16,524
Dear, go there gracefully.

1460
01:49:16,636 --> 01:49:19,833
And as soon as you go there,
greet the guy.

1461
01:49:19,939 --> 01:49:24,501
And then come back. Understood.
- Yes, daddy.

1462
01:49:24,744 --> 01:49:28,510
Shakuntala, stay with your sister.
- Yes.

1463
01:49:31,617 --> 01:49:35,519
Sister... heard what daddy said.
- Yes.

1464
01:49:35,621 --> 01:49:39,523
If this time too you jump like
a monkey, then remember.

1465
01:49:39,625 --> 01:49:42,185
Then you only go. I don't
want to get married.

1466
01:49:43,629 --> 01:49:47,121
Sister. My sweet sister.

1467
01:49:48,634 --> 01:49:51,000
Remember, what daddy said?
- Yes.

1468
01:49:51,104 --> 01:49:53,004
Then let's go.
- Come.

1469
01:49:55,641 --> 01:49:58,735
Leave my hand! Am I a sparrow
that I will flutter away!

1470
01:49:58,845 --> 01:50:03,612
And you don't follow me.
- Fine.

1471
01:50:05,918 --> 01:50:11,083
Now what? - Cover your head
with the veil. And look down.

1472
01:50:13,593 --> 01:50:15,561
Eyes down. More.

1473
01:50:29,609 --> 01:50:31,270
Wow! You!

1474
01:50:33,679 --> 01:50:36,773
How did you go to meet your friend?
- Walking.

1475
01:50:36,883 --> 01:50:38,817
Why didn't you tell me that
you are coming here?

1476
01:50:38,918 --> 01:50:40,613
What did I know that
I am coming here?

1477
01:50:41,621 --> 01:50:43,646
Are these your parents?
- Yes.

1478
01:50:43,756 --> 01:50:46,156
They are very nice. Greetings.

1479
01:50:46,259 --> 01:50:50,195
Father, have you chosen this girl?
- Yes, son.

1480
01:50:50,630 --> 01:50:52,120
Come with me for a moment.

1481
01:51:00,706 --> 01:51:03,641
Mahadev! Mahadev, listen to me!

1482
01:51:06,712 --> 01:51:09,010
Sister!
- What!

1483
01:51:09,115 --> 01:51:12,016
I have told you so many times!
- What?

1484
01:51:12,118 --> 01:51:15,019
You have ruined everything.

1485
01:51:15,121 --> 01:51:17,214
You started chattering, though
you don't know him.

1486
01:51:17,323 --> 01:51:20,349
Shagun, you have met him today.

1487
01:51:20,459 --> 01:51:22,290
We know each other since yesterday.

1488
01:51:22,395 --> 01:51:25,057
First he was in his cab,
then in my car.

1489
01:51:25,164 --> 01:51:27,632
And then there, where
there was nobody.

1490
01:51:27,733 --> 01:51:29,860
I told him everything.
- Everything?

1491
01:51:29,969 --> 01:51:32,767
Yes. Why? - Then this marriage
will happen with great pomp!

1492
01:51:32,872 --> 01:51:35,306
Really!
- My foot!

1493
01:51:35,708 --> 01:51:37,642
Maybe you took birth in this house...

1494
01:51:37,743 --> 01:51:39,643
...so that you could ruin this house!

1495
01:51:39,745 --> 01:51:43,237
This is the problem! I
was born before you!

1496
01:51:43,349 --> 01:51:45,909
Get up! Will you get up or...

1497
01:51:47,854 --> 01:51:51,881
Have patience. They have
still not decided.

1498
01:51:51,991 --> 01:51:53,652
I know what their decision will be!

1499
01:51:53,759 --> 01:51:56,057
Didn't you see how they get
up! What was the hurry!

1500
01:51:56,162 --> 01:51:59,256
Lawyer.
- Look, they have come.

1501
01:52:02,869 --> 01:52:06,737
Tell me, did you like the girl?
What does your son say?

1502
01:52:07,106 --> 01:52:10,234
Lawyer, my son has taken the oath.

1503
01:52:10,343 --> 01:52:16,680
If he will marry any girl... then
it will be this girl only.

1504
01:52:17,783 --> 01:52:19,080
Heard that, Mahadev!

1505
01:52:26,225 --> 01:52:32,824
Mahadev, you heard that.
- I don't believe it.

1506
01:52:32,932 --> 01:52:36,163
Forget it! The alliance
is fixed! Come!

1507
01:52:37,803 --> 01:52:40,203
Narayan.
- Now what?

1508
01:52:40,806 --> 01:52:44,037
Look...
- Do say something.

1509
01:52:44,143 --> 01:52:47,977
Actually the thing is that
these people are so nice.

1510
01:52:48,748 --> 01:52:51,046
We should not hide
anything from them.

1511
01:52:51,150 --> 01:52:52,981
We should tell them.

1512
01:52:53,085 --> 01:52:56,748
As to what the people think
and say about my daughter.

1513
01:52:56,856 --> 01:53:01,418
Objection sustained! We will
tell them right now. Come.

1514
01:53:02,828 --> 01:53:04,728
Remain seated.

1515
01:53:06,832 --> 01:53:10,734
Look... you all are good people.

1516
01:53:11,971 --> 01:53:16,908
Maybe you don't know what people
say about my daughter.

1517
01:53:17,009 --> 01:53:20,103
I know. Your daughter
told me everything.

1518
01:53:20,212 --> 01:53:25,445
But these are just rumors.
- Yes. I know how the world is.

1519
01:53:25,952 --> 01:53:30,753
I have a friend. I myself
got him married.

1520
01:53:30,957 --> 01:53:35,189
His wife is like my younger sister.
But these people...

1521
01:53:38,864 --> 01:53:43,130
Forget about these things. Look,
you are Kusum's father.

1522
01:53:43,235 --> 01:53:46,432
You know how much false
humiliation hurts.

1523
01:53:46,806 --> 01:53:48,330
So know this.

1524
01:53:48,441 --> 01:53:51,774
If some day, due to some reason,
you bad mouth your...

1525
01:53:51,877 --> 01:53:57,315
...daughter then forgive me, I
will say that you talk rubbish!

1526
01:54:00,853 --> 01:54:03,788
But I have one condition.
- Not 1, 2 conditions.

1527
01:54:03,990 --> 01:54:07,289
I have a friend.
- You should have one.

1528
01:54:07,393 --> 01:54:09,384
He always takes my permission
before doing anything.

1529
01:54:09,495 --> 01:54:10,826
It is the symbol of friendship.

1530
01:54:11,030 --> 01:54:13,794
So lawyer, give me a
snap of the girl...

1531
01:54:13,899 --> 01:54:16,800
...so that I can send
it to my friend.

1532
01:54:17,303 --> 01:54:21,967
I had promised him that I will see
the girl and he will choose her.

1533
01:54:22,908 --> 01:54:26,139
Don't worry. He will
like what I choose.

1534
01:54:26,245 --> 01:54:28,805
Why not! Why not! Mahadev!

1535
01:54:29,882 --> 01:54:30,871
Shakuntala!

1536
01:54:38,924 --> 01:54:40,118
Have something.

1537
01:54:42,928 --> 01:54:44,020
Take this, dear.

1538
01:54:44,930 --> 01:54:47,194
Any other condition?
- No.

1539
01:54:47,900 --> 01:54:51,028
Why are you quiet? You
too say something.

1540
01:54:51,137 --> 01:54:54,834
Yes, we both accept
our son's decision.

1541
01:54:54,940 --> 01:54:56,339
Thanks, thanks.

1542
01:54:56,909 --> 01:54:59,207
We take your leave.
- Greetings.

1543
01:54:59,311 --> 01:55:01,836
Ram, write a letter.
- Surely.

1544
01:55:05,885 --> 01:55:06,909
Mahadev.

1545
01:55:11,057 --> 01:55:12,115
Uncle.

1546
01:55:14,560 --> 01:55:21,466
"How many times should I tell
you? How many times..."

1547
01:55:40,986 --> 01:55:43,318
What is written in this letter
that you are smiling?

1548
01:55:43,422 --> 01:55:45,890
It is brother's letter.
- Brother's letter!

1549
01:55:45,991 --> 01:55:48,050
What has he written? Did
he see the girl? - Yes.

1550
01:55:48,160 --> 01:55:49,889
How is she? Did brother like her?

1551
01:55:49,995 --> 01:55:52,054
I will tell you, I will tell you.
I have only partly read it.

1552
01:55:52,164 --> 01:55:53,893
Recite it to me too.
- Hear it.

1553
01:55:53,999 --> 01:55:56,900
The next day my parents took
me to the girl's house...

1554
01:55:57,002 --> 01:56:00,267
...that his lawyer had chosen.

1555
01:56:00,372 --> 01:56:01,999
The girl belongs to
an affluent family.

1556
01:56:02,108 --> 01:56:05,202
But I think that more than wealth,
they prefer virtues.

1557
01:56:05,444 --> 01:56:06,911
Ravi, because you are the
only closest friend...

1558
01:56:07,012 --> 01:56:09,412
...that I have in this world...

1559
01:56:11,083 --> 01:56:12,243
Read further.

1560
01:56:13,018 --> 01:56:16,112
Yes. That's why I am sending
you that girl's snap.

1561
01:56:16,222 --> 01:56:19,589
Snap! I will see it!
- Give it to me! I will see it!

1562
01:56:19,692 --> 01:56:21,956
First I will see it!
- First me! - Give it to me!

1563
01:56:36,375 --> 01:56:38,468
What happened to you?

1564
01:56:40,346 --> 01:56:41,938
Tell me. What's the matter?

1565
01:56:42,047 --> 01:56:44,242
I felt dizzy. I will be fine.

1566
01:56:46,051 --> 01:56:51,614
Wow! She is so nice! So
pretty, so innocent.

1567
01:56:51,724 --> 01:56:54,989
Write a letter to my brother and
tell him to marry him only.

1568
01:56:55,094 --> 01:56:56,118
Will you write it?

1569
01:56:56,462 --> 01:56:58,191
You won't write it?

1570
01:56:59,765 --> 01:57:02,393
Why are you nodding your head!
Tell me, what will you write?

1571
01:57:02,501 --> 01:57:03,559
Whatever I want!

1572
01:57:08,040 --> 01:57:10,133
Fine, you only write it.

1573
01:57:50,549 --> 01:57:56,488
"Is there any other damsel
lovelier than you?"

1574
01:57:56,589 --> 01:58:03,051
"No, no, no. There isn't one."

1575
01:58:03,162 --> 01:58:09,123
"Is there any other damsel
lovelier than you?"

1576
01:58:09,235 --> 01:58:14,673
"No, no, no. There isn't one."

1577
01:58:14,773 --> 01:58:21,042
"Are there such graces,
such eyes like you?"

1578
01:58:21,146 --> 01:58:26,482
"No, no, no. There isn't one."

1579
01:58:51,610 --> 01:58:57,071
"If the world bad mouths you."

1580
01:58:57,182 --> 01:59:02,745
"If somebody says false tales."

1581
01:59:09,194 --> 01:59:15,099
"If the world bad mouths you."

1582
01:59:15,200 --> 01:59:20,502
"If somebody says false tales."

1583
01:59:20,606 --> 01:59:26,408
"Even if they swear."

1584
01:59:26,512 --> 01:59:32,212
"But how can your beloved
believe them?"

1585
01:59:32,418 --> 01:59:38,618
"Can you trust this world?"

1586
01:59:38,724 --> 01:59:44,390
"No, no, no. You can't."

1587
01:59:44,630 --> 01:59:50,591
"Is there any other damsel
lovelier than you?"

1588
01:59:50,703 --> 01:59:56,198
"No, no, no. There isn't one."

1589
02:00:24,203 --> 02:00:29,607
"Your story is different
from the rest."

1590
02:00:29,708 --> 02:00:35,442
"Do me a favor and come near me."

1591
02:00:42,020 --> 02:00:47,390
"Your story is different
from the rest."

1592
02:00:47,493 --> 02:00:53,227
"Do me a favor and come near me."

1593
02:00:53,332 --> 02:00:59,293
"The moon looks at you from
behind the clouds."

1594
02:00:59,405 --> 02:01:05,207
"Even moonlight is crazy about you."

1595
02:01:05,411 --> 02:01:11,281
"Is any other person's name
is lovelier than you?"

1596
02:01:11,583 --> 02:01:17,215
"No, no, no. There isn't one."

1597
02:01:17,322 --> 02:01:23,318
"Is there any other damsel
lovelier than you?"

1598
02:01:23,429 --> 02:01:28,833
"No, no, no. There isn't one."

1599
02:01:29,334 --> 02:01:35,239
"Are there such graces,
such eyes like you?"

1600
02:01:35,340 --> 02:01:40,903
"No, no, no. There isn't one."

1601
02:01:46,351 --> 02:01:49,411
We saw the girl. But
he gives no reply.

1602
02:01:49,521 --> 02:01:51,352
What will they think?
- Who?

1603
02:01:51,457 --> 02:01:53,322
The girl's family. I saw...

1604
02:01:53,425 --> 02:01:57,725
You keep quiet! So son.
- Yes, father.

1605
02:01:57,830 --> 02:01:59,388
What answer should we give
to the girl's family?

1606
02:01:59,498 --> 02:02:01,728
I have sent the snap. I will
receive his answer soon.

1607
02:02:03,702 --> 02:02:04,760
Ram!

1608
02:02:07,339 --> 02:02:10,433
What if he refuses?
- So?

1609
02:02:11,443 --> 02:02:14,276
Mother, you are my sweet mother.
- Yes.

1610
02:02:14,379 --> 02:02:16,711
But he understands
me better than you.

1611
02:02:16,815 --> 02:02:18,749
Post!
- Saw that, mother.

1612
02:02:18,851 --> 02:02:20,978
What did I say! His
reply has arrived!

1613
02:02:21,320 --> 02:02:23,345
First go and take the letter.
- Yes.

1614
02:02:30,395 --> 02:02:33,296
Mother! It is his letter!

1615
02:02:43,408 --> 02:02:47,367
My dear Ram.
- Read further.

1616
02:02:47,613 --> 02:02:51,447
I received your letter. I read it.
I saw the girl's snap too.

1617
02:02:51,550 --> 02:02:54,519
I was delighted. Saw that, mother.
- Hurry up!

1618
02:02:54,620 --> 02:02:58,317
I thought that you will
send me 2-3 girls' snaps.

1619
02:02:58,423 --> 02:03:01,324
What could I do, Ravi? They
showed me only 1 girl.

1620
02:03:01,426 --> 02:03:03,018
Read further.
- Yes, mother.

1621
02:03:03,428 --> 02:03:06,329
But you sent only one girl's letter.

1622
02:03:06,431 --> 02:03:11,767
It implies you like only this girl.
Wow! This is called friendship!

1623
02:03:12,437 --> 02:03:15,338
Miles apart. But hearts
are still connected.

1624
02:03:15,440 --> 02:03:17,374
Fine. Read what he has written.

1625
02:03:17,643 --> 02:03:21,773
Ram, life doesn't end at marriage.

1626
02:03:22,381 --> 02:03:25,612
Wise people have said that
it begins from there.

1627
02:03:26,451 --> 02:03:29,716
I have been pondering over this
truth since the past 2 days.

1628
02:03:30,556 --> 02:03:33,354
And the snap too,
that you have send.

1629
02:03:33,458 --> 02:03:36,359
After thinking a lot and
seeing this girl's snap...

1630
02:03:36,461 --> 02:03:39,362
...I have reached the
conclusion that...

1631
02:03:39,464 --> 02:03:41,932
...this girl is not suitable for you.

1632
02:03:50,576 --> 02:03:52,373
What has he written, Ram?

1633
02:03:58,450 --> 02:03:59,644
Now tell me, son.

1634
02:04:07,759 --> 02:04:09,454
This girl is not suitable for you.

1635
02:04:13,498 --> 02:04:15,398
This girl is not suitable for you.

1636
02:04:15,500 --> 02:04:17,593
'Look, I have been talking
to you since a long time.'

1637
02:04:17,703 --> 02:04:19,671
'Do you think that I am a vagabond?
- No.'

1638
02:04:22,774 --> 02:04:25,038
'Moti is my dog.'

1639
02:04:26,511 --> 02:04:28,877
Now tell us, what answer
should we give to them?

1640
02:04:49,468 --> 02:04:53,370
This one is very good dad.
- Yes, it is but look further.

1641
02:04:54,439 --> 02:04:56,464
This one with orchestra is
very good dad, isn't it?

1642
02:04:56,575 --> 02:05:01,672
Yes, but look further. - Oh! Dad,
look at this one with heart.

1643
02:05:01,780 --> 02:05:04,681
Yes, but it has flowers on it look
further. There are many more.

1644
02:05:07,586 --> 02:05:10,783
Daddy! Dad, this one with
photo is the best one.

1645
02:05:10,889 --> 02:05:13,756
There can be no other card
better than this. Right?

1646
02:05:13,859 --> 02:05:17,022
Weird girl.
- Why? - What's going on?

1647
02:05:17,129 --> 02:05:19,393
I had brought some wedding
cards to be selected.

1648
02:05:19,498 --> 02:05:21,398
You too have a look at it.
- Look at this Shakuntala.

1649
02:05:21,500 --> 02:05:22,899
This one with photos is
really good, right?

1650
02:05:23,001 --> 02:05:25,469
My photo will come here and
his photo here. What say?

1651
02:05:25,570 --> 02:05:28,471
Is this a card?
- Why? - Really awful.

1652
02:05:28,573 --> 02:05:31,406
Then why don't you select
a card yourself?

1653
02:05:33,578 --> 02:05:36,411
Until the cards are published
and till the palanquin...

1654
02:05:36,515 --> 02:05:39,951
...is lifted I'll celebrate this
marriage with such a pomp.

1655
02:05:40,052 --> 02:05:42,919
My daughters, world will
remember this wedding.

1656
02:05:43,021 --> 02:05:47,424
Yes, daddy. - No, daddy. I don't
like any of these cards.

1657
02:05:47,526 --> 02:05:50,427
I liked the card which came
day before the yesterday...

1658
02:05:50,529 --> 02:05:53,555
...From the ministers house.
- So you keep it for your wedding.

1659
02:05:53,965 --> 02:05:57,526
What's the harm in having
a look? - Yes I'll bring it.

1660
02:05:57,636 --> 02:06:00,070
Go bring it.
- Come back soon!

1661
02:06:00,672 --> 02:06:04,130
Daddy, you always listen to her.

1662
02:06:04,242 --> 02:06:08,042
So what after all she
is your younger sister.

1663
02:06:08,146 --> 02:06:13,982
But it's my wedding Daddy.
- Oh! A new issue.

1664
02:06:27,566 --> 02:06:28,590
You?

1665
02:06:34,172 --> 02:06:40,475
Come sit. You have come
on such a good occasion.

1666
02:06:40,579 --> 02:06:49,817
Come sit, sit. Daddy and I were
selecting the wedding cards.

1667
02:06:50,789 --> 02:06:52,848
Which design out of these is good?

1668
02:06:53,592 --> 02:06:58,894
Every moment dad is busy thinking
about the marriage.

1669
02:07:01,767 --> 02:07:04,099
He says that he'll celebrate
it with pomp.

1670
02:07:04,603 --> 02:07:09,040
He says that Shakuntala your
sister is very fortunate.

1671
02:07:09,141 --> 02:07:11,234
To have such a good bridegroom.

1672
02:07:11,676 --> 02:07:15,510
Now what should I say to you?
He has completely changed.

1673
02:07:15,614 --> 02:07:21,519
There was a day when he
was not keeping well.

1674
02:07:22,587 --> 02:07:25,522
And now see he is rejuvenated.

1675
02:07:25,957 --> 02:07:29,654
And this is all because of you.
Just because of you.

1676
02:07:32,697 --> 02:07:38,226
Ok you sit, I'll call my dad.
- Listen!

1677
02:07:55,320 --> 02:07:57,550
Did you write the letter
to your friend?

1678
02:07:58,657 --> 02:08:03,651
Did he reply? What has he written?

1679
02:08:37,963 --> 02:08:45,199
Ravi! Why are you upset?

1680
02:08:47,005 --> 02:08:50,202
Destiny can't be changed by tears.

1681
02:08:51,676 --> 02:08:53,803
Maybe this is the destiny
of my sister.

1682
02:08:55,680 --> 02:09:00,617
Very kind of you to break
this news to us.

1683
02:09:01,653 --> 02:09:07,683
Do one more favor on us. - But.
- You can only save my father.

1684
02:09:08,059 --> 02:09:12,689
But this letter? My friend...
- I don't mean to say that.

1685
02:09:13,732 --> 02:09:19,967
You marry my sister. Yes,
if she would get married.

1686
02:09:20,739 --> 02:09:23,867
Then at least one of us
would get a new life.

1687
02:09:25,810 --> 02:09:29,143
If you want all three
of us to be alive then.

1688
02:09:29,848 --> 02:09:32,908
Don't break the news to
my father. For few days.

1689
02:09:34,719 --> 02:09:37,279
He won't be able to bear the trauma.

1690
02:09:37,689 --> 02:09:44,720
No, no. Ok, now I'll leave.

1691
02:09:50,702 --> 02:09:53,933
If possible then forgive me.

1692
02:10:03,715 --> 02:10:09,051
Brother what have you done?
What have you done?

1693
02:10:11,756 --> 02:10:14,816
Daddy, what is she doing?
Why hasn't she returned?

1694
02:10:14,926 --> 02:10:17,360
She must be on her way. She
is searching the card.

1695
02:10:17,462 --> 02:10:19,987
Here she comes. Dear, have
you brought the card?

1696
02:10:22,801 --> 02:10:26,100
Card? Oh yes, I'll just get it.

1697
02:10:28,907 --> 02:10:31,705
See dad, she is pretending
as if the whole...

1698
02:10:31,810 --> 02:10:35,007
...wedding burden is solely
on her shoulders.

1699
02:11:17,789 --> 02:11:20,758
Brother! You? You returned soon.

1700
02:11:20,992 --> 02:11:23,927
How is the girl? Is
the marriage fixed?

1701
02:11:30,035 --> 02:11:32,401
Why are you silent? Tell me.

1702
02:11:32,504 --> 02:11:34,836
What had written to you
about the girl's photo?

1703
02:11:34,939 --> 02:11:38,773
He didn't tell you?
- No, he didn't.

1704
02:11:38,877 --> 02:11:42,074
But when he saw the
photo he turned pale.

1705
02:11:42,180 --> 02:11:46,048
And since then he is disturbed.
I don't know what's wrong?

1706
02:11:48,553 --> 02:11:52,785
Let him come we'll ask.
- Ok, brother I'll be back.

1707
02:11:58,897 --> 02:12:00,421
'No, he didn't.'

1708
02:12:00,532 --> 02:12:03,797
' But when he saw the photo
he turned pale.'

1709
02:12:03,902 --> 02:12:07,861
'And since then he is disturbed.
I don't know what's wrong? '

1710
02:12:07,972 --> 02:12:09,803
Post!

1711
02:12:37,001 --> 02:12:43,873
- Ram, you? I thought you would
return 2-3 days later?

1712
02:12:43,975 --> 02:12:45,909
The work got over
soon so I returned.

1713
02:12:48,947 --> 02:12:49,971
How is everybody in the house?

1714
02:12:50,081 --> 02:12:51,241
Everybody is first class.

1715
02:12:53,485 --> 02:12:58,013
The girl's photo that you had sent
me, I didn't like her much.

1716
02:12:58,957 --> 02:13:01,118
So what? You told me your decision
and I agreed to it.

1717
02:13:01,226 --> 02:13:06,027
Now to hell with the girl. But Ravi.

1718
02:13:07,065 --> 02:13:11,001
Tell me one thing. When we
met for the first time.

1719
02:13:11,102 --> 02:13:15,971
Why did you say that you came
here to commit suicide, then?

1720
02:13:16,107 --> 02:13:24,606
What was the matter? Tell
why are you silent?

1721
02:13:24,916 --> 02:13:28,943
Forget it Ram, it's an old topic.
- Yes, but I want to know.

1722
02:13:29,053 --> 02:13:34,116
This happens in every home.
- Yes, quarrels, fights, tears etc.

1723
02:13:34,225 --> 02:13:36,921
But what was the matter that
made you adamant for suicide.

1724
02:13:37,028 --> 02:13:41,055
Don't ask Ram, don't ask. I
won't be able to answer it.

1725
02:13:41,166 --> 02:13:48,902
I'll tell the truth. The girl
whose photo you sent me...

1726
02:13:49,007 --> 02:13:51,100
You loved that girl.
- Ram!

1727
02:13:51,209 --> 02:13:54,940
And then you raped her.
- Shut the crap.

1728
02:13:55,046 --> 02:13:57,981
And when you were afraid of being
exposed then you came here.

1729
02:13:58,082 --> 02:14:03,042
For God's sake stop it Ram!
That girl is my sister.

1730
02:14:03,154 --> 02:14:07,955
That girl is my sister.
- Yes! Now you came on the track.

1731
02:14:08,059 --> 02:14:09,924
You now spoke the truth
when I forced you to.

1732
02:14:10,962 --> 02:14:12,930
Read this letter now,
in front of me.

1733
02:14:18,436 --> 02:14:22,998
Ravi brother. - This is your
sister's letter, right? - Yes. - Read!

1734
02:14:23,107 --> 02:14:28,943
When you wrote about your friend,
we were relieved.

1735
02:14:29,047 --> 02:14:32,949
But when I read those words
of yours I was taken aback...

1736
02:14:33,051 --> 02:14:37,147
...You wrote that the girl
is not good enough for you.

1737
02:14:37,255 --> 02:14:42,591
Brother, I swear to God
that our Kusum is pure.

1738
02:14:42,694 --> 02:14:46,960
But when you ran away in spite
of being her brother.

1739
02:14:47,065 --> 02:14:49,590
Then society's misconception
turned into truth.

1740
02:14:50,235 --> 02:14:53,966
Father tried a lot to get his
humiliated daughter married.

1741
02:14:54,072 --> 02:14:57,974
But those who came to
see her, rejected.

1742
02:14:58,576 --> 02:15:02,478
Dad started feeling suffocated
about this fact.

1743
02:15:03,248 --> 02:15:07,446
But one day God himself came to us.

1744
02:15:08,152 --> 02:15:12,987
In your friend Ram's disguise.
And he said that.

1745
02:15:13,558 --> 02:15:17,585
My friend shall select the
bride and I shall marry.

1746
02:15:18,029 --> 02:15:27,233
But... but... - My friend shall
select the bride and I shall marry.

1747
02:15:27,338 --> 02:15:31,035
But the marriage did not take
place. Because of you.

1748
02:15:31,142 --> 02:15:35,135
There are some weddings where
the outsiders intervene.

1749
02:15:35,246 --> 02:15:37,612
But this must have happened
for the first time that...

1750
02:15:37,715 --> 02:15:40,548
...a brother did not let his
sister's marriage take place.

1751
02:15:40,652 --> 02:15:45,487
And only you can be held
responsible for that.

1752
02:15:45,590 --> 02:15:52,621
Only you. Wait! Where are you going?

1753
02:15:59,070 --> 02:16:01,732
You think you are educated?
Well cultured.

1754
02:16:01,839 --> 02:16:06,401
Brother of two sisters?
- Coward! You call yourself human?

1755
02:16:06,511 --> 02:16:09,105
Ram!
- Forget Ram.

1756
02:16:09,213 --> 02:16:11,738
Tell me why did you run
away from your house?

1757
02:16:11,849 --> 02:16:16,650
People there used to tease me.
- Tease you what?

1758
02:16:16,754 --> 02:16:19,052
That my sister's character
is not good.

1759
02:16:19,590 --> 02:16:22,388
More the issue is hyped.
- We had spoken about your wife.

1760
02:16:22,493 --> 02:16:24,358
Here in this city then why
didn't you believe me then?

1761
02:16:24,462 --> 02:16:27,397
That was a different thing and
this is different thing.

1762
02:16:27,498 --> 02:16:29,056
How come? That was
also humiliation...

1763
02:16:29,167 --> 02:16:30,191
...and this is also humiliation.

1764
02:16:30,301 --> 02:16:32,326
If you didn't believe that then
why did you believe this?

1765
02:16:32,437 --> 02:16:37,067
No, Ram, no. - You are an orthodox.
You have no will of yours

1766
02:16:37,175 --> 02:16:39,075
Some jerk said something
about your...

1767
02:16:39,177 --> 02:16:41,372
...sister and you came here,
considering it to be true.

1768
02:16:41,479 --> 02:16:43,310
What would have you done if
you were to be in my place?

1769
02:16:43,414 --> 02:16:46,508
I would have left no stone unturned.

1770
02:16:46,617 --> 02:16:50,610
And if I found any truth in this
case I would kill the girl.

1771
02:16:50,722 --> 02:16:56,422
And if not then I would kill the
jerk and his family members.

1772
02:16:57,195 --> 02:17:01,632
And after that I would let
the law hang me till death.

1773
02:17:02,367 --> 02:17:08,431
But you are a coward who
ran here. Shameless.

1774
02:17:08,539 --> 02:17:14,102
May the worse happen to you. I feel
humiliated to call you my friend.

1775
02:17:20,551 --> 02:17:26,717
Ram call me coward, shameless
or whatever.

1776
02:17:27,291 --> 02:17:30,124
But don't abuse the relation
that I have...

1777
02:17:30,228 --> 02:17:34,494
...considered to be bigger than
my mother, father and sisters.

1778
02:17:35,299 --> 02:17:42,603
And that is friendship. - What
do you know what friendship is?

1779
02:17:43,207 --> 02:17:47,143
If you were to be my true friend,
and if this case...

1780
02:17:47,245 --> 02:17:51,375
...was true then you would
drag your sister to me.

1781
02:17:51,516 --> 02:17:55,748
And say Ram, my sister's
character is bad.

1782
02:17:55,853 --> 02:17:57,878
Give her a new life. Marry her.

1783
02:17:58,256 --> 02:18:00,315
And then I would understand that
you know what friendship is.

1784
02:18:00,425 --> 02:18:06,295
But no, first you hid the
matter from your friend.

1785
02:18:07,198 --> 02:18:10,326
And then you ruined
your sister's life.

1786
02:18:10,435 --> 02:18:14,599
No Ram, no. I have kept
no secret in friendship.

1787
02:18:15,473 --> 02:18:19,170
But whatever I have done try to
see it with my point of view.

1788
02:18:19,477 --> 02:18:22,173
I didn't let my sister marry
you considering that...

1789
02:18:22,280 --> 02:18:25,181
...she might be a girl
of bad character.

1790
02:18:25,283 --> 02:18:28,275
And that she would
ruin your life too.

1791
02:18:28,619 --> 02:18:31,452
At that moment of time I didn't
knew what was in my hand.

1792
02:18:31,556 --> 02:18:33,183
That I am holding poison or nectar?

1793
02:18:33,591 --> 02:18:37,186
And if the world would have said
that it's nectar and not poison.

1794
02:18:37,295 --> 02:18:40,696
But if I doubted it then I
wouldn't let you have it.

1795
02:18:40,798 --> 02:18:44,791
My friend I wouldn't
have let you have it.

1796
02:18:45,570 --> 02:18:49,370
I did the same. Now you can
think whatever you want to.

1797
02:19:13,598 --> 02:19:19,662
Hey! I am sorry. I tried to
haste in understanding you.

1798
02:19:19,770 --> 02:19:21,670
Made a mistake to understand
your friendship.

1799
02:19:22,440 --> 02:19:25,876
Who can understand friendship
better than you?

1800
02:19:30,848 --> 02:19:33,510
You have honestly fulfilled
the duties of friendship.

1801
02:19:34,352 --> 02:19:38,254
Now let me think about my duties.

1802
02:19:52,436 --> 02:19:57,305
Shree Chand, come, come.
Greetings! - Greetings!

1803
02:19:59,310 --> 02:20:04,475
See, how much shopping I have done.

1804
02:20:04,582 --> 02:20:07,676
Yes it's all because of your money.
- No its all because of my deeds.

1805
02:20:07,785 --> 02:20:09,275
Otherwise some people
used to say that...

1806
02:20:09,387 --> 02:20:11,685
...my daughter Kusum would
never get married.

1807
02:20:11,789 --> 02:20:14,019
Now see what I'll do.
- What will you do?

1808
02:20:14,325 --> 02:20:20,992
I'll shut your mouth by celebrating
the wedding with pomp.

1809
02:20:21,365 --> 02:20:24,459
And you know who the bridegroom is?
- Must be someone.

1810
02:20:24,569 --> 02:20:26,594
He is not someone some
where but he is here.

1811
02:20:26,704 --> 02:20:30,504
He is Ram. And he is B.A. Graduated.

1812
02:20:30,608 --> 02:20:35,011
A gem of a person.
- Yes, very good! Congratulations.

1813
02:20:35,479 --> 02:20:41,315
Listen, what about your daughter?

1814
02:20:41,419 --> 02:20:45,549
Who eloped with someone? Did
you get any news about her?

1815
02:20:45,723 --> 02:20:52,526
No. Then do one thing cut her
neck as soon as she is back.

1816
02:20:52,630 --> 02:20:55,394
I'll send the knife.
- Enough! Madhav.

1817
02:20:55,499 --> 02:21:01,369
Yes, Shreechand you had
given me the same advice.

1818
02:21:04,542 --> 02:21:06,840
What are you saying? Kusum's
marriage is fixed?

1819
02:21:06,944 --> 02:21:11,040
Who said?
- I have heard it by my own ears.

1820
02:21:11,449 --> 02:21:17,081
No, Kusum can't get married
until Bakke is alive.

1821
02:21:17,388 --> 02:21:20,016
Kusum can't get married.

1822
02:21:21,892 --> 02:21:25,350
Are you father of Ram?
- Yes, do you have any doubt?

1823
02:21:25,463 --> 02:21:27,693
Is he really your son or have
you brought him from garbage?

1824
02:21:27,798 --> 02:21:29,356
What crap are you saying?
- Is your Ram...

1825
02:21:29,467 --> 02:21:33,096
...lame, deaf or blind? Or
does he have any disease?

1826
02:21:33,204 --> 02:21:36,105
Shut up. Listen, by God's grace
my son is very healthy.

1827
02:21:36,207 --> 02:21:37,731
Then why are you making
him a scapegoat?

1828
02:21:37,842 --> 02:21:40,402
Just for money? Just for money?
- What do you mean?

1829
02:21:40,511 --> 02:21:43,969
You won't understand.
Mother you are a woman.

1830
02:21:44,081 --> 02:21:45,639
And a mother also so you'll
understand better.

1831
02:21:45,750 --> 02:21:48,378
Just think. Just think that
if your daughter-in-law...

1832
02:21:48,486 --> 02:21:51,387
...is of a bad character. Then what
kind of children will she bore?

1833
02:21:51,489 --> 02:21:55,391
Listen. - The world is greedy
for money. - Listen.

1834
02:21:55,493 --> 02:21:59,395
I will not listen at all.
I am a respectful man.

1835
02:21:59,497 --> 02:22:01,692
Whenever I see something wrong.

1836
02:22:01,799 --> 02:22:04,563
Or injustice I go and inform
others so I informed you.

1837
02:22:04,669 --> 02:22:08,435
You didn't think about your
son, your grand children

1838
02:22:08,539 --> 02:22:14,409
Ram, dear you're back?
- Oh! So he is Ram.

1839
02:22:14,512 --> 02:22:20,644
Who are you?
- King of truth. - What's your name?

1840
02:22:20,751 --> 02:22:22,981
I am famous for my work.

1841
02:22:23,087 --> 02:22:25,419
Anyway if you want to know
my name then whole...

1842
02:22:25,523 --> 02:22:29,550
...world knows me by the
name of M. A Bankelal.

1843
02:22:33,631 --> 02:22:40,434
Blood! He killed me! He
killed me! He killed me!

1844
02:22:43,507 --> 02:22:46,442
Master is killed! Master is
killed! Master is killed!

1845
02:22:46,544 --> 02:22:49,445
Save her! Save him! He killed me!

1846
02:22:49,547 --> 02:22:53,813
Catch the killer! He has killed me!

1847
02:22:56,887 --> 02:22:59,447
Jerk, scoundrel. You talk foul
about a well cultured girl.

1848
02:22:59,557 --> 02:23:05,689
See with your own eyes.
- See a good man getting beaten up.

1849
02:23:05,796 --> 02:23:08,788
I just told him that don't
marry a bad girl.

1850
02:23:08,899 --> 02:23:09,957
And see what he did to me.
- Jerk, again!

1851
02:23:10,067 --> 02:23:16,973
Tell the truth, tell the truth.
- Yes, first move this, move this.

1852
02:23:17,074 --> 02:23:18,564
My life is precious to me.

1853
02:23:18,676 --> 02:23:26,776
I have spread rumors about the
innocent and pure Kusum.

1854
02:23:26,984 --> 02:23:28,474
Thinking that the world
will consider her as...

1855
02:23:28,586 --> 02:23:30,178
...a girl with a poor character.

1856
02:23:30,287 --> 02:23:33,552
And then her father will be
forced to marry Kusum to me.

1857
02:23:33,657 --> 02:23:37,821
And then I'll enjoy my life with
her father's enormous wealth.

1858
02:23:37,928 --> 02:23:42,524
But the world is such a big fool.
They believed a lie.

1859
02:23:42,633 --> 02:23:45,659
He is abusing us take him
to the police station.

1860
02:23:51,542 --> 02:23:54,170
Dad, come with me.
- Where?

1861
02:23:54,278 --> 02:23:56,007
- To the temple. I want
to marry Kusum today itself.

1862
02:23:56,113 --> 02:23:58,513
Son, may Kusum be pure
but world will...

1863
02:23:58,616 --> 02:24:01,585
...always look at her
with insulting eyes.

1864
02:24:01,685 --> 02:24:04,586
Mother, Kusum is pure,
pure like a holy water.

1865
02:24:04,688 --> 02:24:07,521
What is the proof of that?
- What is the proof...

1866
02:24:07,625 --> 02:24:09,991
...that you only are my mother?

1867
02:24:12,563 --> 02:24:15,999
The purity can't be proven
it can only be felt.

1868
02:24:21,572 --> 02:24:26,600
My decision is firm, whether
you come or don't.

1869
02:24:44,962 --> 02:24:48,557
Dear, I had order 8
of these bangles...

1870
02:24:48,666 --> 02:24:52,864
...but only 4 has been
sent? (10:20:03:02)

1871
02:24:52,970 --> 02:24:58,875
I had given you the bill right?
- No, dad you hadn't.

1872
02:25:02,646 --> 02:25:06,082
Then I must have kept it some where.

1873
02:25:33,043 --> 02:25:41,280
Letter. Whose letter is it?

1874
02:25:41,852 --> 02:25:44,719
Dearest Ram...
Yes writing is known.

1875
02:25:45,689 --> 02:25:51,059
Who is Ram? That means
it's friend of Ram?

1876
02:26:00,838 --> 02:26:12,045
Not worth you! Not worth
you. Not worth you.

1877
02:26:21,191 --> 02:26:30,657
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!
You read this letter?

1878
02:26:30,768 --> 02:26:35,671
I always hid it from you. Thinking
that you won't bear it.

1879
02:26:40,377 --> 02:26:45,906
Yes I read the letter
of your brother.

1880
02:26:46,016 --> 02:26:48,951
Ravi brother's letter. Where is he?

1881
02:26:49,053 --> 02:26:55,185
Write him a letter and call him
here or else I won't marry.

1882
02:27:02,533 --> 02:27:07,869
Dad, what's wrong with you?
- I should write a letter?

1883
02:27:08,072 --> 02:27:11,701
Whom should I write letter?
To your brother?

1884
02:27:11,809 --> 02:27:17,975
Who stopped your wedding.
- Is this true Shaku?

1885
02:27:25,756 --> 02:27:28,452
But why did he do like this? Why?

1886
02:27:28,759 --> 02:27:31,728
Because he must have
also come to know...

1887
02:27:31,829 --> 02:27:35,094
...that you are a girl of a bad
character. Every body says that.

1888
02:27:35,199 --> 02:27:37,724
But I never said you
have a bad character.

1889
02:27:37,835 --> 02:27:41,999
But today I too will say that your
character is poor. Poor! Poor!

1890
02:27:42,106 --> 02:27:46,065
No, dad! Don't say like this.
Don't say like this.

1891
02:27:46,176 --> 02:27:49,737
Why shouldn't I? When every body
says then I too will say.

1892
02:27:49,847 --> 02:27:54,978
Your character is poor.
Let everyone else say.

1893
02:27:55,085 --> 02:27:57,849
Let brother also say,
let Shakku also say.

1894
02:27:57,955 --> 02:28:01,391
But you don't say.
- Why shouldn't I?

1895
02:28:01,492 --> 02:28:03,255
When everyone says that
your character is poor.

1896
02:28:03,360 --> 02:28:07,763
Get lost from my house before I...
- Yes, kill me.

1897
02:28:07,865 --> 02:28:15,237
I'll kill you today.
- Dad, what are you doing?

1898
02:28:15,339 --> 02:28:19,105
Go, from here. - Shakku, listen
to what father is saying?

1899
02:28:21,812 --> 02:28:26,249
Yes, poor character.
- Kusum you too go.

1900
02:28:26,350 --> 02:28:33,518
Please, dad go.
- Daddy! Daddy!

1901
02:28:35,993 --> 02:28:37,119
My character is not poor.
My character is not poor.

1902
02:28:37,227 --> 02:28:41,857
Till today, I haven't said
this. But today, I will.

1903
02:28:48,839 --> 02:28:55,472
Poor character! Poor character!
Poor character!

1904
02:29:04,154 --> 02:29:13,290
Oh! You? You have come.
Why have you come here?

1905
02:29:13,397 --> 02:29:16,833
Where a girl with a poor
character resides?

1906
02:29:16,934 --> 02:29:19,869
What are you saying?
- Yes, I am saying the truth.

1907
02:29:19,970 --> 02:29:22,029
This is a humiliated family.

1908
02:29:22,139 --> 02:29:27,202
Where a brother says that his
sister's character is poor.

1909
02:29:27,311 --> 02:29:35,116
Means... - Dad has read
the letter. - So what?

1910
02:29:35,285 --> 02:29:38,880
Because of him you rejected
my daughter, right?

1911
02:29:41,225 --> 02:29:46,857
Let him say anything. I promise
that I'll marry your daughter.

1912
02:29:46,964 --> 02:29:50,331
Now I can trust nobody. Nobody.

1913
02:29:50,434 --> 02:29:54,234
But I am ready to go
against the world.

1914
02:29:54,338 --> 02:30:00,868
No, please go. I beg
of you please go, go!

1915
02:30:01,945 --> 02:30:10,216
Ok, I'll go but not alone. But only
after marrying your daughter.

1916
02:30:10,320 --> 02:30:14,086
Shakuntala! Shakuntala go
call your sister right now.

1917
02:30:14,191 --> 02:30:15,886
I want to wait for any
auspicious time.

1918
02:30:15,993 --> 02:30:18,894
I want to marry her right
now. Go call her!

1919
02:30:21,732 --> 02:30:27,534
Sister, sister. Get up.
Iook, who has come!

1920
02:30:27,638 --> 02:30:30,402
Ram! He has told Daddy that...

1921
02:30:30,507 --> 02:30:35,240
He wants to marry you right now.
Come on, get up, get up.

1922
02:30:58,035 --> 02:31:05,669
Sister! Daddy! Sister has swallowed
all the sleeping pills.

1923
02:31:07,110 --> 02:31:10,944
Sister! Sister!

1924
02:31:20,123 --> 02:31:24,560
- Kusum! Kusum! Open your eyes.

1925
02:31:24,661 --> 02:31:29,155
Look at me. I know that
world has humiliated you.

1926
02:31:29,333 --> 02:31:32,200
But I have never bothered
about that.

1927
02:31:32,302 --> 02:31:36,966
In fact I am here to marry you.
Kusum! Kusum! Kusum!

1928
02:31:37,074 --> 02:31:39,565
Open your eyes Kusum.
Open your eyes.

1929
02:31:40,143 --> 02:31:45,979
Hello! Doctor uncle.

1930
02:32:06,036 --> 02:32:16,742
Everyone says that I am
of a poor character.

1931
02:32:16,847 --> 02:32:23,685
I didn't say that, dear.
I didn't mean that.

1932
02:32:30,394 --> 02:32:34,524
No, no, Kusum! I won't let you go!

1933
02:32:34,631 --> 02:32:39,364
You will go as a married
woman. As my wife.

1934
02:32:57,354 --> 02:33:03,554
Kusum? Look, Kusum. Look Kusum!

1935
02:33:12,903 --> 02:33:17,237
No... Kusum No!

1936
02:33:31,121 --> 02:33:36,081
- Ram. - Ravi, come, come.

1937
02:33:36,460 --> 02:33:41,329
You are a little late. You
missed the auspicious time.

1938
02:33:41,431 --> 02:33:46,095
Look at your sister,
look at her eyes...

1939
02:33:46,203 --> 02:33:50,139
...lnnocent as it were before dying.

1940
02:33:51,408 --> 02:33:55,105
Why are you sitting Ravi?
Go at least...

1941
02:33:55,212 --> 02:33:58,773
...give her a good see off.
Go bring a palanquin.

1942
02:34:00,150 --> 02:34:05,110
So that the world comes
to know that until...

1943
02:34:05,222 --> 02:34:10,125
...an innocent girl is
humiliated like this.

1944
02:34:10,227 --> 02:34:12,855
Their procession will
also come like this.

1945
02:34:13,163 --> 02:34:15,757
Her palanquin will be
lifted like this.

1946
02:34:16,233 --> 02:34:19,225
Go Ravi bring a palanquin. Go, Go.

1947
02:34:19,336 --> 02:34:26,139
This is the last moment of journey.
The very last moment.

1948
02:34:26,243 --> 02:34:27,471
The very last moment.

1949
02:34:40,190 --> 02:34:41,623
How long has it been since she
has swallowed the pills?

1950
02:34:41,725 --> 02:34:46,856
1 hour doctor. - Ok, take her
in the room immediately.

1951
02:35:01,278 --> 02:35:02,472
You sit outside.

1952
02:35:25,302 --> 02:35:30,467
- 'God, why do you always give
troubles to your true followers? '

1953
02:35:31,308 --> 02:35:37,679
'Lf something happens to her
then I won't forgive you.

1954
02:35:37,781 --> 02:35:39,578
I won't forgive you.'

1955
02:35:41,418 --> 02:35:46,219
'God if I am to be held responsible
for my sister's...

1956
02:35:46,323 --> 02:35:52,228
...condition then punish me, take
my life. But save my sister.'

1957
02:35:55,332 --> 02:35:59,234
'God save my daughter.'

1958
02:36:00,270 --> 02:36:05,298
I knew she was pure
like sacred water.

1959
02:36:06,276 --> 02:36:13,273
But then too I doubted her.
Save her God, save her.'

1960
02:36:23,460 --> 02:36:26,725
Madhav-ji, your daughter's
life is saved.

1961
02:36:28,298 --> 02:36:29,765
Can we go in?
- Yes.

1962
02:36:44,381 --> 02:36:49,478
Sister. - Shaku, now I am
not going to hear you, ok?
