1
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,420
Is it ready?

2
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,170
When did I ask for it?

3
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:07,420
Almost done.

4
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,420
Come back.

5
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,170
Get back here right now.

6
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:13,550
I'll slog all day
and you'll have fun.

7
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:15,880
What is it?

8
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:21,380
I asked for some chips.
Why can't you get it?

9
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:25,920
Why can't you answer?

10
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,800
You slut! I'll bring home the money
and you'll enjoy it.

11
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:35,010
Are you tired of me?

12
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:37,840
Say it... Say it...

13
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,670
Let Mom go.

14
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,550
Dad, let go of Mom.

15
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,090
Bloody hell! All I wanted was some chips.

16
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:48,300
Leave Mom alone.

17
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:51,170
I'm beating my wife.
What's your problem?

18
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:52,970
Go study.

19
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:57,470
I've been trying to concentrate
for a long time but I can't.

20
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:59,010
This has been happening
for a long time.

21
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:01,880
- Please stop. Will you stop now, please?
- Get out.

22
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,550
Go to your room.
Nothing is going on here.

23
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:07,090
Your dad will cool down in some time.

24
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:10,380
- Then the three of us...
- Will go out for dinner.

25
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,970
It's your birthday at midnight.

26
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:17,510
Listen to your mother for once.
Go to your room.

27
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:25,260
Finish your homework.
I'll finish... Anyway...

28
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:28,720
Did you give birth to this thing?
This bastard?

29
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,800
He can't be mine.

30
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,800
He's so disobedient.

31
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,920
He can't be my son.

32
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,090
- Who else did you sleep with?
- Let Mom go.

33
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,670
Let Mom go, you rascal!

34
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:56,550
Did you not hear me, idiot?
Let Mom go.

35
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:04,800
Say it again.

36
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,300
Let Mom go, rascal.

37
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:12,090
- Say it again.
- Let Mom go, rascal.

38
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:19,340
- Say it again.
- Let Mom go, rascal.

39
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,130
- Say it again.
- Let Mom go, rascal.

40
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,510
I'll beat you to a pulp.

41
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:35,010
Get lost.

42
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:38,130
Don't forget that I'm the one who pays
for stuff around here.

43
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:41,630
You've taught him to misbehave like this.

44
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:47,090
Who else did you sleep with?
Is he my son? Tell me.

45
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:49,380
I'll kill you.

46
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,630
Answer me.

47
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:55,920
Or I'll thrash answers out of you.

48
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:34,510
Hello, Bhowanipore Police Station?

49
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,510
There has been a murder.

50
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,050
I've murdered my father
just moments back.

51
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:47,880
The address is
105, Harish Mukherjee Road.

52
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:52,510
Once you cross the park,
it's the third house on the right.

53
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:58,760
Yes... Please come fast.
Okay.

54
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:50,380
Happy birthday to me.

55
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:00,260
This is my father,
Debiprasad Bhowmik.

56
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:04,010
And this little boy is me.

57
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,090
I'll give you a brief introduction.

58
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:08,470
Then I'll be able to tell you
the actual story properly.

59
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:12,300
Otherwise, we'll spend
all our time... Anyway.

60
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:16,170
My father was a serious makeup artist.

61
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:18,510
It was a form of worship for him.

62
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,800
He didn't care about anyone.

63
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,590
Once he scolded an actor for chatting
in the middle of the makeup session.

64
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:30,340
After that everyone fell in line.

65
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:32,470
Anyway...

66
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,090
My mother left us when I was very young.

67
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,880
My father meant the world to me.

68
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:40,550
I followed in his footstep
and started a career in makeup.

69
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:43,090
I started studying it.

70
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,880
Father taught me as well.

71
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,800
I started learning with all my heart.

72
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,510
I started going to the neighbourhood library.

73
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:55,800
I began devouring all the books on makeup
I could get my hands on.

74
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,380
Then with the access to the internet,
I was unstoppable.

75
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:05,720
Not just makeup, I started delving into
prosthetics, special effects...

76
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:11,840
plastic surgery, colours, drawing, art etc.

77
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,630
National and international artistes...
Oh, yeah...

78
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:17,550
I completely forgot to tell you...
That's where I got my name...

79
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,880
Van Gogh is the real deal, bro.
He is a true artiste.

80
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,760
He was never appreciated
during his life.

81
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,170
He never sold a painting in his lifetime.

82
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:29,880
But now the entire world
is crazy about his work.

83
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,800
Actually, he was much ahead
of his time.

84
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,800
Genius!

85
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,090
- He had enough support.
- What do you mean?

86
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:40,880
He was nothing without the support
of his brother Theo and friend Ganguin.

87
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,050
- What are you saying?
- Basically, he was mad.

88
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:45,260
Just because he cut off his ear
doesn't make him a genius.

89
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:50,510
You can call Picasso or Dali genius.

90
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:53,300
- They brought in a newness in their art.
- That Van Gogh did too.

91
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,670
Please, no point saying that, buddy.

92
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:59,010
You can say Van Gogh's strokes
had newness in them.

93
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:00,920
Otherwise, it's all Monet and Manet.

94
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,340
They're all amateurs.

95
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,970
- What?
- Excuse me.

96
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:10,720
Everyone is an amateur
compared to Leonardo.

97
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:13,920
The names you just mentioned
were just painters.

98
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:18,170
But if there is true genius
then it has to be Leonardo da Vinci.

99
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:20,760
He wasn't only an artiste
but a scientist too.

100
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,510
According to you, Van Gogh, Picasso,
Rembrandt, Dali are all amateurs.

101
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,130
- Absolutely!
- Are you kidding me?

102
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:29,470
Why would I?

103
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:31,630
If you want to argue,
you must study about it.

104
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:38,300
The only artiste who might come close
is probably Michelangelo.

105
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,420
But Leo is Leo.

106
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:42,920
- Have you been smoking up?
- Tell us how?

107
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:44,510
- How?
- Yes.

108
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:46,510
I'll explain it to you.

109
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:49,130
One must do some research
into the subject.

110
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,090
Watch your mouth.

111
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:56,800
Da Vinci was the first to prove to the world
that art is science and science is art.

112
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,010
Forget the paintings.

113
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:03,340
The sculptures, the designs for helicopters
and other machines...

114
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:08,420
Blueprints of different weapons, the hydraulics,
the pulley and so many other works.

115
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:12,340
Tell me who else has been able to do it.

116
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:15,510
Has anyone come close to his achievements?

117
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,300
Give me one name.

118
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:21,880
He is a Da Vinci fanboy.

119
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:28,260
So what's your name?
Da Vinci's fan, Vinci Da?

120
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:33,880
Whatever my name was...

121
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:40,220
but the name given by those two intellectuals
that day became popular.

122
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,760
That name stuck with me.

123
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,800
Yes, I'm Vinci Da.

124
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:46,760
And this is my story.

125
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,510
I am happy to announce
that the honourable court...

126
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:55,380
has been pleased to rule in favour of my client
Mr. Shyamsundar Jaiswal.

127
00:09:55,510 --> 00:10:00,010
He has been awarded unconditional acquittal
with all damages included.

128
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:02,880
Due to lack of any substantial evidence
against him.

129
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,340
Mr. Jaiswal, your reaction on your release?

130
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,840
I am very happy.

131
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,130
I've been acquitted.
I knew I was innocent.

132
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:11,590
And the court said the same thing today.

133
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:14,920
So, are you saying the Rs. 2500 crore scam
didn't happen?

134
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,010
Please don't harass my client. Enough.

135
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:19,090
- No more questions.
- Let me take this.

136
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,260
See, the scam did happen.

137
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,760
And someone has done it.

138
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:26,510
But High Court just said
that that person is not me.

139
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:28,630
Mr. Jaiswal, one last question.

140
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:31,170
The company, the hotel,
the resort is all yours.

141
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:32,380
Then, who did the scam?

142
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:37,130
Just blame it
on the legendary criminal Nando Ghosh.

143
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:43,420
Hail Lord Vishnu!

144
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:46,470
Hail Lord Vishnu!

145
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:51,300
Put this on his head, heart and feet.

146
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:54,510
The person whose shadow
I've been under...

147
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:56,800
The person I learnt my craft from...

148
00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:00,260
The person who never let me feel
the absence of a mother...

149
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,840
That person left me alone one day.

150
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:06,550
I wanted to remember
his living, smiling face.

151
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,590
Not the stone cold dead face.

152
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,510
I avoided looking at his face
while performing the last rites.

153
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,590
But finally when I saw his face...

154
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:20,470
I couldn't bear
looking at it.

155
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,670
Sir, where are you going?

156
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:40,510
- He's gone crazy.
- He just lost his dad.

157
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:46,170
He used to love his father a lot.

158
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:57,130
What are you doing?

159
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,880
Have you lost your mind?

160
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:03,010
Can't you see his face
is looking so lifeless?

161
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,170
My father was an artiste.

162
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:09,340
He should look good for his farewell.

163
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,380
Just these flowers won't do justice.

164
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,220
What is he talking about?

165
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,340
He's gone bonkers.

166
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,130
Makeup was done.

167
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,510
My father entered the set.

168
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:31,760
And we waited quietly
for the shot to be over.

169
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:36,670
I met one of Father's friends
from the film industry.

170
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,920
He said time for experimenting
and studying is over.

171
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:42,380
I must earn a living now.

172
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:46,470
I'll never be famous
if I don't get my act together.

173
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,260
He gave me the contact
of a famous director.

174
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,840
He asked me to meet for work.

175
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:02,670
I forgot to tell you about Jaya.

176
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,220
She is very sweet girl
from my neighbourhood.

177
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:10,760
I used to like her a lot.

178
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:14,760
I was very serious about her, I swear.

179
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:16,920
You can call it love.

180
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:20,220
She was by my side through the ups
and downs, even from a distance.

181
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:23,720
She was my inspiration
to do great work.

182
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:27,170
It was my plan to do something great
for her.

183
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,920
But it was difficult to meet her
or talk to her.

184
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,590
Her father was very strict.

185
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:34,550
And what did you do after that?

186
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:37,010
I drove the car back, sir.

187
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:41,170
But the accused left the hotel lobby
with his girlfriend, Ms. Gupta.

188
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:42,800
Where did you join them?

189
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,880
Boss had called me.

190
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,840
So, I met them on the way.

191
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,090
And I took the keys.

192
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:52,220
So, were you driving the car
when the accident happened?

193
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,050
Yes, sir.

194
00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:03,010
And your boss's girlfriend
was sitting with you instead of him?

195
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,170
Yes, sir.

196
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:05,590
Sure?

197
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,010
Yes, sir.

198
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:10,970
So, when the car hit the divider,
killing Ms. Gupta on the spot...

199
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:13,470
you were driving the car,
not your boss?

200
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,920
Yes, sir.

201
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:21,970
And before the crash, the car ran over
five people sleeping on the pavement...

202
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:23,920
you were driving the car,
not your boss?

203
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:29,470
They constantly want fresh blood.
Is this a blood bank?

204
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:31,090
Sir, Debiprasad's son is here.

205
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:33,880
Send him here.

206
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,970
- Here he comes.
- Who?

207
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:36,880
Come here.

208
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,760
Are you talking about Debi Bhowmik?

209
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:41,760
Isn't he from the Ice Ages?

210
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,970
He passed away recently.

211
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:49,630
A common friend asked me to meet his son
to give him work.

212
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,220
Hello, sir.

213
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:55,920
Abhijeet told me about you.

214
00:14:56,130 --> 00:15:00,590
Do you have any skills
or are you using your father's name to get work?

215
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,630
I am good at what I do.

216
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:04,800
Great.

217
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:09,130
Why did you leave Sujit's shoot?

218
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:10,420
What?

219
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:13,130
I felt insulted that's why.

220
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:14,590
Why?

221
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:21,670
He told me before the shoot started
that we have to compete with Bombay.

222
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,760
I was doing the prosthetic makeup.

223
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,050
A man who had been in a blast.

224
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:30,670
I had spent four and a half hours
to get the actor ready.

225
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:34,260
Sujit said it was excellent work.

226
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,670
But then he said...

227
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:41,420
The prosthetic makeup was so realistic,
the blood, the skin...

228
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:45,590
that the Censor Board
would chop that scene off.

229
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,300
If that was the case,
why did he push me so hard?

230
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,090
That's why I quit.

231
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:55,720
You want to surpass
the Bombay film industry, right?

232
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:57,720
I don't want to.
I can.

233
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:02,130
And I can do it in half the budget.

234
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:04,220
Got it.

235
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,800
Hey, come here.

236
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:12,220
Call Vikram and push the call time
by an hour.

237
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:12,800
Okay.

238
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,670
Take him to the actress
and explain the character to him.

239
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:16,090
Okay.

240
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:17,380
Go with him.

241
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,130
- Go ahead.
- Thank you, sir.

242
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:23,010
I want to see your work.

243
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:26,130
Fresh blood.

244
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:31,130
- You are unneccesarily tensed.
- It's not about that.

245
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:33,800
- It's nothing. Nothing will happen.
- Things are getting worse.

246
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,010
It's not about confidence. It's okay.
Nothing to worry about.

247
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:38,630
These people again.

248
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,920
No comments. No comments.

249
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,220
You'll get to know anyway.
Please move out of the way.

250
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,090
- Please give way.
- Excuse me. Excuse us.

251
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:47,510
Please... No comments...

252
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:53,970
He got the acquittal after all.

253
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:55,720
He was supposed to get it anyway.

254
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,260
The last judge got transferred.

255
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:59,630
The one before him died mysteriously.

256
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:02,130
Who will take this kind of pressure?

257
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:04,010
What happened to the girl?

258
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:05,130
What else?

259
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:07,170
If she has money, she'll appeal again.

260
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:08,470
Next, it'll go to the Supreme Court.

261
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:11,920
The person who was raped
will have to prove that she was raped yet again.

262
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,470
Ridiculous!

263
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:15,630
He is very perverted.

264
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,510
He has a distorted mind.

265
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:19,470
He is very experimental.

266
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,340
And he films himself in the act.

267
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,970
Hey!

268
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:24,880
What have you done?

269
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,130
Didn't my assistant brief you?

270
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,300
He just told me about the character.

271
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:33,050
I found out about the entire story
and today's scene.

272
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:36,760
I did this makeup after I figured out
the flow of the scene.

273
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:42,380
After so much effort, you came up
with this ugly, realistic makeup?

274
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:45,340
Don't you understand gloss at all?

275
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,380
What is the problem with beauty?

276
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,340
Sir, the character is starving
for 10 days.

277
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,260
She's struggling.

278
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:55,220
If she looks like a glamourous model,
will we be doing justice to the audience?

279
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,260
This is an urban mainstream film.

280
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:01,010
People will be watching the heroine
and her acting not your makeup.

281
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:02,340
Makeup is a part of acting.

282
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,380
So is the camera's angle.

283
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:06,840
The writer's dialogue is as much
a part of the acting as is the production design.

284
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,550
We don't need you right now.

285
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:12,670
If there's something in the future projects,
we'll call you. Good bye.

286
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,470
What is so funny?

287
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:22,630
Sir, you asked me if I was using
my father's name to get work.

288
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:26,340
Sir, I'm not doing it but...

289
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:31,170
I can see you're using your late uncle's legacy
to get work in the industry.

290
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,510
The first film was good.
But I couldn't sit through the next four.

291
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:36,720
Horrible makeup, horrible costume.

292
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,840
The most horrible thing was the art.

293
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,720
Absolutely no research on props, right?

294
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,090
Who the hell do you think you are?

295
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,800
Nobody.

296
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:51,800
I'm one of the technicians who you haven't paid
despite having a lot of black money.

297
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,670
Hey.

298
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:58,470
You will not get a job here
or anywhere else in the country.

299
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,880
I know.

300
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:03,720
That's why I want to tell you something
before I leave.

301
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:10,720
It's just your luck that even after
being such a bad actor, you're still a super star.

302
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,050
And you know that very well.

303
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:14,300
So don't show your expertise
about makeup.

304
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,090
Makeup is an art.

305
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:18,050
Your thick brain can't handle it.

306
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,090
Bloody swine!

307
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,090
You didn't get the job?

308
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,090
Nope.

309
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,130
They abused me and threw me out,
bloody idiots.

310
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:53,550
Forget about them.

311
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:57,420
You'll find another job.

312
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:58,590
Like hell, I will.

313
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,720
They're very powerful people.

314
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:05,130
They'll not let me work
in the film industry anymore.

315
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:09,380
That's okay.

316
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:12,630
You can...find some other work...

317
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,510
You have time.

318
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:26,470
Because I stammer...

319
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:30,590
they can't find a groom for me...

320
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:39,380
We'll get married, right?

321
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:46,220
During the rituals,
you'll have to chant Sanskrit words...

322
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,840
How will you utter those?

323
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:52,670
I've thought about it.

324
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,880
I'm quite stressed about it.

325
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:05,970
- The priest from the neighbourhood...
- Bonomali...

326
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:09,720
I've learnt the important part.

327
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:11,840
I'll just say that.

328
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:15,130
Repeatedly...
What will you say?

329
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,090
You know...

330
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:22,090
"May my heart be yours.

331
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:28,760
- May your heart...
- May your heart...

332
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:38,090
Catch that man!
Pickpocket!

333
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,590
Thank you, brother.

334
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,550
Thank you.

335
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,970
So, where are you going right now?

336
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:09,050
We have to go to the police station.

337
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:10,130
What?

338
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:11,840
Yeah, you broke the law.

339
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,300
Now we have to put it back together.

340
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,380
- What do you mean?
- You'll see.

341
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:37,760
I lied a little while ago.

342
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:42,880
This is the first time in my boring life
I've got a chance to be the hero.

343
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,800
That's why I couldn't help myself.

344
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:47,920
This is not just my story.

345
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:49,510
It's his story too.

346
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:53,010
He was a little screwed up since he was a kid.

347
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:56,130
He has a sharp mind.
He's very well read.

348
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:59,130
And he's crazy about Law.

349
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:02,670
He wanted to be a criminal lawyer.

350
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:04,760
He loved his mother.

351
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:07,760
His father was a drunk scum.

352
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:10,300
And that's where the trouble started.

353
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:14,260
He killed his father exactly half an hour
before he turned 18...

354
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,590
and escaped the death penalty.

355
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:18,720
Oh, you're here?

356
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:21,130
I'm ready to go.

357
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:24,260
Let's go.

358
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,470
Do you want some chips?

359
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:32,720
He freed his mother from that horrible life.

360
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,920
But strangely, his mother got scared.

361
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:39,130
She thought he was crazy
and left him alone.

362
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:42,050
He killed his father.
His mother left him.

363
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:45,470
For the lack of opportunity,
situation, time and money...

364
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:47,510
He couldn't become a criminal lawyer.

365
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:51,300
Instead, he got a criminal record.

366
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,630
But he was not one to give up.

367
00:23:55,800 --> 00:24:00,090
He continued studying Law
even inside the asylum.

368
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:06,130
He would feel very unsettled
if he was not close to the Law.

369
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:10,970
So, he started going to the court
after being released from the asylum.

370
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:14,010
He started taking notes on the difficult cases.

371
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:17,720
Then he set up his own office
outside the courtroom.

372
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:22,340
Experienced lawyers would drop by
to take his advice on cases.

373
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,590
He earned a lot of money.

374
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:30,090
But by that time, Adi Bose
had completely lost his mind.

375
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:37,800
Mukherjee, of all the police stations
under me...

376
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:41,300
yours is the most efficient.

377
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,420
So, see to it,
this doesn't happen again.

378
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:44,550
It won't, sir.

379
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:46,670
If we get a high profile case.

380
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:48,510
Involving ministers, businessmen etc...

381
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:50,510
- Then we'll need your help.
- Of course, I'll look into it.

382
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,920
- You can't go in.
- It's urgent.

383
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,670
Sorry, sir.
He just barged in.

384
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:57,010
Wait. Yes, tell me.

385
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:59,590
There's a pickpocket in my car.

386
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:02,170
He was beaten very badly by a mob.
He's dying.

387
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:04,300
Please look into it.

388
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,550
Take a look.
Give him the keys.

389
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,050
The car is not locked.

390
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:12,470
Where did you find him?

391
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:13,840
I was on my way to the court.

392
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,840
Saw him... Brought him here.

393
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:17,470
I'm a lawyer, sir.

394
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,340
Where do you practice?
Alipore Court?

395
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:23,220
No... Actually, I don't...

396
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:25,420
I haven't started yet.
About to start my practice.

397
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:28,630
- Civil?
- No.

398
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:30,380
Criminal.

399
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,300
Sir?

400
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:34,380
He is in a very bad state.

401
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:36,170
We've to take him to the hospital right now.

402
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:38,880
Then, take him.

403
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:43,050
Why didn't you take him to the hospital?
What if he died?

404
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:44,260
But, sir, the Law?

405
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,470
Law comes before everything else.

406
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,880
Life and death are secondary.

407
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:48,720
Okay.

408
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:54,130
Actually, the Law is our living, Mr...

409
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:56,170
- Adi Bose.
- Adi Bose.

410
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,720
The thing is, if the criminal dies...

411
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:04,590
we can't follow him into the pyre to cuff him.

412
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:07,920
But Law's hands are not that long.

413
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:10,010
That's why you need a hook like me.

414
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:13,380
Like picking a fruit from the tree.

415
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:15,300
Sir, what sections will you
book him under?

416
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:24,920
Normal ones...
Whatever is applicable for pickpocketing.

417
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,800
There are no provisions for pickpocketing
in the Indian Penal Code.

418
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,050
You'll have to book him under theft.

419
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,840
378 and 379.

420
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,760
And there's mental trauma caused
to the person he stole from.

421
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:36,300
That amounts to voluntary harassment,
so you can charge him under Section 323, as well.

422
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:39,170
Good bye.

423
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:44,630
What was his name?

424
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,010
Are you done?

425
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:32,340
How much longer?

426
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:36,050
You have to wait.
You're too restless.

427
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:40,300
Sit quietly. Don't move.
And don't blink at all.

428
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:45,720
Irritating me all the time.

429
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:13,050
Hey, what's the matter with you?

430
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:18,800
- Do you want some tea, Uncle?
- Yeah.

431
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:22,670
I left town for a few days...

432
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:25,300
and you've screwed things up
in the meantime.

433
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,220
Got it.

434
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:33,840
What have I done wrong this time?

435
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,670
What? Don't you want to work
in the industry anymore?

436
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:40,920
You've picked a fight again in the studio.

437
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:44,090
They've complained to you, right?

438
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:48,300
They were saying a lot of mean things to me.
I kept quiet.

439
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:51,090
They said whatever they felt like.

440
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:55,220
I'm a self-respecting artiste.
How can I tolerate such nonsense?

441
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:58,720
Apparently, I use my dad's name to get work
and I don't have any makeup skills.

442
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,050
Those bloody idiots.

443
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:03,970
I work from the heart.

444
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:08,050
And the director criticising my work
just runs an assembly line factory.

445
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:10,840
All he wants is to earn money.
He is not interested in films at all.

446
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,800
- I'm the only one who says...
- Why don't you adjust a bit.

447
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,880
Absolutely not.

448
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,420
Am I a newbie that I'll keep my head down?

449
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:21,050
I'm poor but I'm proud of my work.
I am happy.

450
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:24,760
I heard you're doing makeup for the kids' plays
and brides to earn money.

451
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:30,420
- An artiste like you...
- An artiste doesn't differentiate...

452
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:36,470
The ordinary girl I dress up
on her wedding day...

453
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,380
the happiness on her face
is nothing less than the National Award.

454
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:41,970
It's difficult work.

455
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:46,340
And you were talking about the kids' play?
Damn right, I do them.

456
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:48,010
They are more honest
than the film people.

457
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:50,880
The honesty with which they perform...

458
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,760
the big directors and so called actors
from the industry will soil their pants.

459
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,260
They'll feel ashamed.

460
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:58,800
So you will not change, right?

461
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,380
Will you have some biscuits?

462
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:28,920
I delve into your mind
but find only masks

463
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:36,510
Like a hunter waiting to kill
You hide

464
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:45,220
I look into your eyes
I'm lost in your train of thoughts

465
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:52,720
The sore wounds don't stop bleeding

466
00:30:53,670 --> 00:31:00,420
The one you see, the one you feel
Is not real

467
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:04,170
He lives in a lonely corner

468
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:07,970
He hears the dead scream

469
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:11,920
He lives in a lonely corner

470
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:15,970
He hears the dead scream

471
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:18,300
Every day

472
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:32,550
The stench of burning flesh
Comes from your room

473
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:40,720
Darkness grabs me

474
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:49,130
Your heart cages the gods

475
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:56,670
Mankind creeps towards extinction

476
00:31:57,510 --> 00:32:04,420
The one you see, the one you feel
Is not real

477
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:08,130
He lives in a lonely corner

478
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:12,090
He hears the dead scream

479
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:15,970
He lives in a lonely corner

480
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:20,510
He hears the dead scream

481
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:28,010
Does Mr. Vinci live here?

482
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:29,800
Da... It's Vinci Da.

483
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,670
Tell me.

484
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,760
I wanted to talk to you about a film.

485
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:36,380
Film...

486
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:38,510
Please take a seat.
Please sit.

487
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,840
Give me a minute.

488
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,050
Sorry... The house is a mess...

489
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:51,130
- Would you like some tea?
- No, thank you.

490
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,630
- There's a film being made.
- Oh, okay.

491
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:58,880
Shyamsundar Jaiswal, the businessman.

492
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:03,670
- Shyamsundar was in...
- Jail but not anymore.

493
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,550
It's based on his life.
He's had a very interesting life.

494
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:10,970
Biopic... Bumba, the superstar
will play his character.

495
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:12,050
Okay.

496
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:14,340
We were trying out prosthetic makeup.

497
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,630
We spoke to some people in Bombay.

498
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,050
Dates are clashing.

499
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:19,720
And the cost is very high.

500
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,300
Really high.

501
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,300
That's why we decided to get someone
from Kolkata.

502
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:27,800
Everyone in the industry vouched for you.

503
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,840
Are you interested?

504
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:33,260
What?

505
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:40,170
It's a huge offer.

506
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:42,670
Such a great opportunity.

507
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:46,050
Actually, I've been doing it for a long time.

508
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:49,630
I've been doing research
for the last 10 years.

509
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:53,420
But there's not much prosthetic work...

510
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,050
I know.

511
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:54,970
Yeah...

512
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:58,050
But I've been carrying on with my work.

513
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,170
So, I can do it.

514
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:03,590
But prosthetics are expensive.

515
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:04,720
That's alright.

516
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,760
But how would it be?

517
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,510
Will it be like a mask?

518
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:13,260
It'll be very real.
You won't be able to tell the difference.

519
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,300
- You get it?
- I get it?

520
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,380
The person whose face we'll be copying...

521
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:21,090
the colour of his skin,
each wrinkle...

522
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:22,340
the colour of his eyes...

523
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:23,260
- Will it match?
- Absolutely...

524
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:25,340
You won't be able to tell them apart.

525
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:27,260
- I'll match it exactly.
- That's exactly what I want.

526
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:32,090
For a perfect fit,
I'll have to measure Bumba's face.

527
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:35,550
The mask has to be fixed
on his face.

528
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:37,340
- You get it?
- You'll have to make a sample first.

529
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:40,050
Make one according to my face.

530
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:41,300
Let me show it to them.

531
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:43,260
Let them see it.

532
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:47,920
If it's approved you can go
and take Bumba's measurement.

533
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:49,880
We're in a hurry.

534
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,720
It'll be done on time.

535
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:56,970
I'll have to buy the chemicals
and materials.

536
00:34:57,170 --> 00:35:00,550
- So, if you can give some advance...
- Of course... Here you go.

537
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:01,340
What's this?

538
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:06,800
This has Jaiswal's photos and videos
for your reference.

539
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:10,340
There's a difference in their heights
and body structures...

540
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,720
- There won't be an issue...
- Are you sure?

541
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:15,420
I can make him fatter with a body suit.

542
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,630
- I can make him wear heels...
- Won't be too different, right?

543
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:20,800
It would be exact.
No one will be able to tell.

544
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:23,260
Great! You get to work.
When should I come?

545
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:28,050
Some events alter our lives
so much that...

546
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:30,170
you think while drinking...

547
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,840
What would my life be
if that event didn't happen?

548
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:36,760
What would happen to me?

549
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,920
Would I then...

550
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:44,090
Yes, meeting Adi Bose
was that life altering event for me.

551
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:49,880
It was very difficult to ignore
the part of my brain that he had tickled.

552
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,170
Art, my friend, art.

553
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:58,220
Asking me to do a complicated
and difficult makeup was like...

554
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:04,010
asking a starving tiger to taste a deer.

555
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:06,470
And you know what?

556
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:11,050
The relationship between an artiste
and the blank canvas is like...

557
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:14,380
lovers' naked bodies.

558
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,420
Do you remember the feeling
of touching your lover for the first time?

559
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:21,420
I felt the same way.

560
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:25,300
I felt a spark
when I touched his face for the first time.

561
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:28,800
This canvas will make me paint a masterpiece.

562
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:30,970
And that's what happened.

563
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,550
Standing in front of the mirror...

564
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:35,760
the duet between my hand and his face...

565
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,420
had resulted in something like
a Vitruvian Man.

566
00:36:54,550 --> 00:37:02,300
I delve into your mind
but find only masks

567
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:09,880
Like a hunter waiting to kill
You hide

568
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:18,590
I look into your eyes
I'm lost in your train of thoughts

569
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:25,630
The sore wounds don't stop bleeding

570
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:33,840
The one you see, the one you feel
Is not real

571
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:37,590
He lives in a lonely corner

572
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:41,380
He hears the dead scream

573
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:45,720
He lives in a lonely corner

574
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:49,630
He hears the dead scream

575
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:53,420
Every day

576
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:06,010
The stench of burning flesh
Comes from your room

577
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:12,420
Darkness grabs me

578
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:22,590
Your heart cages the gods

579
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:29,800
Mankind creeps towards extinction

580
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:37,800
The one you see, the one you feel
Is not real

581
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:41,550
He lives in a lonely corner

582
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:45,340
He hears the dead scream

583
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:49,300
He lives in a lonely corner

584
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:53,470
He hears the dead scream

585
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:56,170
Every day

586
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:33,090
What's burning in that head of yours?

587
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:40,340
Let it burn
But the beehive doesn't break

588
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:49,590
You have the fever
without a cure

589
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:57,840
This everlasting fear doesn't let go

590
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:04,840
The one you see, the one you feel
Is not real

591
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:08,800
He lives in a lonely corner

592
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,670
He hears the dead scream

593
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:17,050
He lives in a lonely corner

594
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:21,550
This bank has been robbed in broad daylight.

595
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:26,260
The person behind this crime
is famous businessman, Shyamshundar Jaiswal.

596
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:32,010
He can be clearly spotted on
the bank's CCTV footage and phone videos.

597
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:48,010
He pointed his gun at us and took all the money.

598
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:51,090
There was a scuffle with the security guard.

599
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:52,760
Then he shot the man.

600
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:57,010
I still have shivers down my spine.

601
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:03,090
I have seen with my own eyes
that it was Shyamsundar Jaiswal.

602
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:05,590
The guy who was involved
in the scam.

603
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:08,010
He came in
and threatened everyone.

604
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:12,170
He pointed his gun at everyone
and took all the money.

605
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:14,340
He even got into a scuffle
with the security guard.

606
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:16,340
He shot the security guard.

607
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:19,970
He's missing since morning.
Police are looking into it.

608
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:21,720
We've started the investigation.

609
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:23,840
The area has been cordoned off.

610
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:28,010
You'll get to know if we discover
any new information.

611
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:29,840
Till then please wait outside.
Thank you.

612
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,420
No one is being allowed inside the bank.

613
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:36,720
Even DCDD Bijoy Poddar
has no further comments.

614
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:41,590
Hello, Rajdeep.

615
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:43,340
Yes, I had kept my phone switched off.

616
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:45,880
You know that I have my appointment
with Pinky.

617
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,130
What should I do now?

618
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:49,300
What the heck is this?
I don't understand.

619
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,550
The media will say anything, Rajdeep.

620
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:52,260
Bail?

621
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:55,170
What do you think?
I'll murder someone for petty cash?

622
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:57,760
Okay, I'm canceling everything
and heading to the farmhouse.

623
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,800
But for how many days?

624
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:00,760
Any other number? SMS?

625
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,010
Take me to the farmhouse.

626
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:19,090
We're standing in front
of Shyamsundar Jaiswal's house.

627
00:42:19,090 --> 00:42:22,760
He's missing since the bank robbery
in the morning.

628
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:26,380
We've been trying to reach him
since morning but he remains at large.

629
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:30,220
But according to his office colleagues
he is out of the city.

630
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:34,760
He's the same guy involved
in the scam.

631
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,380
I saw him with my own eyes.

632
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:39,880
His lawyer just told us he is not in the city.

633
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:43,630
My client had mentioned
that he'll be going out of Kolkata today.

634
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:45,170
And I know it's true.

635
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:46,880
I'm sure my client is innocent.

636
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,170
Then who robbed the bank?

637
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:51,550
I really don't know where he is.

638
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:54,420
He never tells me anything.

639
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:56,380
I can understand but...

640
00:42:57,130 --> 00:42:57,970
you must know something.

641
00:42:57,970 --> 00:43:01,920
I've already told you that he had gone
towards Singur to look at some land.

642
00:43:02,170 --> 00:43:03,800
He even called me.

643
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:06,340
Since then, I don't know his whereabouts.

644
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,470
His phone is switched off too.

645
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:12,880
Sorry but I must say this.

646
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:16,050
There's the CCTV footage
from the bank.

647
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:19,760
Plus some phone videos of the robbery
and the murder.

648
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:21,260
And then, there's you.

649
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:24,050
And you are Jaiswal's right hand man.

650
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:27,920
A phone call that you received
that no one else heard.

651
00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:31,090
Do you really consider it an alibi?

652
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:33,010
Please check my call list.

653
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:35,170
I don't doubt that he called you.

654
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:38,760
He could have called you after the robbery
from highway while he was fleeing.

655
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:40,760
I don't know what you spoke about.

656
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:44,170
Why are you harassing us, sir?

657
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,090
Why would he do it?

658
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:51,550
If he wants he can buy
six of those banks...

659
00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:52,920
The thing is...

660
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:55,590
There's a difference between six banks
and one police station.

661
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:59,670
The man who has died was newly wed
and his father is unwell.

662
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:02,340
One more word from you
and I'll slap you hard...

663
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:04,720
And my alibi will be I was with your mother.

664
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:06,380
Bloody idiot!

665
00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:07,720
What's the number?

666
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:09,130
Whose?

667
00:44:09,130 --> 00:44:10,510
Not your mother's.

668
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:13,970
- Shyamsundar's...
- 9830033344.

669
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:15,760
Do I look like a rookie?

670
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:17,380
I have this number.

671
00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:22,090
Give me his driver's number.
We'll use it for geotracking.

672
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:24,220
Who did this?

673
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:27,260
Who said it?

674
00:44:29,970 --> 00:44:32,630
I want an answer now.

675
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:35,220
Rohit started it, sir.

676
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:38,050
Is that true, Rohit?

677
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:39,590
It was all over the internet, sir.

678
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:43,050
- It's true. Disha's dad has killed someone.
- Shut up!

679
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:44,920
Just shut up.

680
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:50,340
Three of you go back to your classes.
Three of you stay back.

681
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,880
And Disha, I think,
you should be going home.

682
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:07,010
Move... Move... Quick.
This way.

683
00:45:07,090 --> 00:45:08,920
- Sir...
- Follow me.

684
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:11,880
Follow me.

685
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:13,170
Go to the first floor. Quick.

686
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:14,630
You go to the bedroom.

687
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:17,420
- Come with me.
- What are you doing here?

688
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:18,970
- Cover it from all sides.
- From the front...

689
00:45:18,970 --> 00:45:21,090
- I'm approaching the back.
- There he is...

690
00:45:21,090 --> 00:45:22,800
- Bapi, this way...
- Sir, he has a gun.

691
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,220
Cover me, I'm going in.

692
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:25,510
- Kick the door open.
- Watch the left side.

693
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:26,720
Break the door.
Kick it in.

694
00:45:28,470 --> 00:45:30,130
Who are you people?

695
00:45:31,050 --> 00:45:34,970
- What are you doing?
- Put him in the van...

696
00:45:35,090 --> 00:45:36,720
- Why are doing this?
- Shut up.

697
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:39,050
- Bapi, hurry up...
- Let me go.

698
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:40,800
Come on... Let's go...

699
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,590
Let me talk to my lawyer.

700
00:45:42,590 --> 00:45:45,300
Do you know who I am?

701
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:48,420
Robbing a bank, killing a security guard....

702
00:45:48,590 --> 00:45:51,090
Carrying a gun without license,
shooting a cop...

703
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:53,470
Of course, I know who you are.

704
00:45:53,470 --> 00:45:54,760
Get in the car.

705
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:57,590
- Let's go.
- Believe me, I haven't done anything.

706
00:45:57,590 --> 00:46:00,630
Get in. Let's go.

707
00:46:01,010 --> 00:46:05,260
- I haven't done anything...
- Shut up.

708
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:09,760
Shyamsundar Jaiswal is being presented
in court today.

709
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,050
DCDD Poddar is also present.

710
00:46:12,050 --> 00:46:16,670
The police said he was arrested
from his farmhouse last night.

711
00:46:16,670 --> 00:46:21,630
Along with the robbery, he is also accused
of murdering a security guard.

712
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:31,970
His 10-year-old daughter
tried to commit suicide.

713
00:46:31,970 --> 00:46:34,300
His lawyer still insists he's innocent.

714
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:36,470
And that he was out of the city
at the time of the crime.

715
00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:38,970
The police has arrested him
from his farmhouse, right?

716
00:46:38,970 --> 00:46:43,670
How can one man be in two places
at the same time?

717
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,170
And we'll prove that in court.

718
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:47,170
My client is innocent.

719
00:46:47,170 --> 00:46:48,010
Watching the news?

720
00:46:48,010 --> 00:46:50,220
He's being framed.
There's a conspiracy...

721
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:51,800
What's all this?

722
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:52,760
Please, wait...

723
00:46:54,010 --> 00:46:55,260
Isn't it great?

724
00:46:55,590 --> 00:46:57,050
Why are you laughing?

725
00:46:57,670 --> 00:46:59,010
What is so funny?

726
00:46:59,010 --> 00:47:03,130
What are they showing on TV?
You told me it's for a film.

727
00:47:03,130 --> 00:47:06,090
Bumba the superstar...

728
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:08,340
- Shyamsundar in my prosthetic...
- I'll tell you everything.

729
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:09,880
I did my job.

730
00:47:10,510 --> 00:47:13,090
But they're saying the same person
is in both places.

731
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:15,970
- Yeah...
- Tell me something...

732
00:47:15,970 --> 00:47:18,130
I've seen that face on TV.

733
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:20,470
That prosthetic, that makeup...

734
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:22,050
Did I do it?

735
00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:23,880
- And that man?
- That's me.

736
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:25,220
You couldn't tell?

737
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,470
What can I say?

738
00:47:30,170 --> 00:47:32,010
- You robbed a bank?
- Yes.

739
00:47:34,470 --> 00:47:36,720
- You killed the guard?
- Yeah...

740
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:40,760
- You shot the cop?
- That I didn't...

741
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,420
I didn't shoot the cop.

742
00:47:42,510 --> 00:47:47,010
Shyamsundar had a panic attack
and shot him.

743
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:49,260
But I did everything in the bank.

744
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:54,010
But why?

745
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:56,260
I'll tell you
but first some tea.

746
00:47:57,170 --> 00:48:00,170
Please make some strong tea
with ginger.

747
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:02,130
I'll tell you everything.

748
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:25,420
Thank you.

749
00:48:28,550 --> 00:48:33,420
You see Vinci Da,
I'm a serial lawyer.

750
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:35,800
What do you mean?

751
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:43,300
According to normal definitions,
I'm a serial killer.

752
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:48,550
Apparently, I'm mentally disturbed.

753
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:52,720
I choose my victims according to a pattern
stuck in my mind.

754
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:55,630
Victim's pattern?

755
00:48:55,630 --> 00:48:57,550
Yeah, that's it.

756
00:48:57,550 --> 00:49:00,590
Say Shyamsundar,
my so-called victim.

757
00:49:00,590 --> 00:49:02,470
Am I killing him?

758
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:05,170
Am I killing him?

759
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:08,510
No, I'm not.

760
00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:10,380
He's the killer.

761
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:14,840
He's swindled so much money.

762
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:18,970
He's stealing poor people's savings.

763
00:49:18,970 --> 00:49:23,090
So many people are suffering,
committing suicide.

764
00:49:23,090 --> 00:49:26,010
It was a Rs. 2500 crore scam.
Didn't you read in the papers?

765
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:30,300
But he got away with it
because he is powerful.

766
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:35,170
I committed a crime like him
and gave him up to the law.

767
00:49:38,670 --> 00:49:41,010
Crime like him?

768
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:44,920
Crime... If you think of it as crime.

769
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:48,420
Then you're a criminal.
I'm a criminal.

770
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:50,300
We're partners in crime.

771
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:52,590
- Right?
- What?

772
00:49:54,050 --> 00:49:58,420
You might think like that.
But I think you are an artiste.

773
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:01,800
He's robbed the common man
and I've robbed the bank.

774
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:04,720
It's the same thing.
Isn't it?

775
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:07,470
Bank robberies are a thing of the past now.

776
00:50:08,590 --> 00:50:12,340
Next time, we should do something smart.

777
00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:15,970
The crime and the criminal
should be at par.

778
00:50:16,510 --> 00:50:18,130
Have to match it.

779
00:50:18,130 --> 00:50:22,090
- Next time?
- Of course...

780
00:50:22,090 --> 00:50:24,340
Otherwise, what's the point of the word serial?

781
00:50:25,050 --> 00:50:29,630
Serial lawyer.
Not serial killer though.

782
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:34,260
Are you... Are you really a lawyer?

783
00:50:38,970 --> 00:50:43,090
I really wanted to be a lawyer
but it didn't work out.

784
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:50,170
I have loved the Law
since I was a kid.

785
00:50:50,170 --> 00:50:52,510
I've been reading law books as a boy.

786
00:50:52,510 --> 00:50:57,130
While listening to his life story,
I realised that the man was absolutely crazy.

787
00:50:57,130 --> 00:51:02,090
And I've unknowingly involved myself
in a crime with a criminal.

788
00:51:02,090 --> 00:51:04,970
Because no matter how much he argued
in defense of his mission...

789
00:51:04,970 --> 00:51:09,340
or he tried to prove what monsters
his chosen victims were...

790
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:12,970
I couldn't forget,
even if I took everything else away...

791
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:16,260
the innocent security guard.

792
00:51:17,630 --> 00:51:19,970
Anyway, that's my story.

793
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:22,510
No, I get it.

794
00:51:24,010 --> 00:51:28,840
But a lot of innocent people are affected
because of what you're doing.

795
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:31,800
- It's not their fault...
- That's collateral damage.

796
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,630
There's some in every war.

797
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:38,840
In any big war...
If you want to achieve something big...

798
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:43,170
Happens all the time.

799
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:45,800
It's an unrelated accident.

800
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:51,130
Believe me, the guard,
the daughter's attempted suicide...

801
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:55,090
These were absolutely unplanned surprises.

802
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:59,840
But Shyamsundar is in jail.

803
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:04,170
He's been destroying so many lives...

804
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,720
Now, he can't anymore.

805
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:08,090
Clear?

806
00:52:11,470 --> 00:52:12,800
Got it.

807
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:15,510
But I don't know.

808
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:18,260
I'm just an ordinary artiste.

809
00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:22,800
- I don't want to play God...
- You don't need to be God to punish Evil.

810
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:26,010
You need Ubermenschen.

811
00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:31,090
When God is dead,
they fix things.

812
00:52:31,130 --> 00:52:33,630
What's right,
what's wrong?

813
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:36,510
What's just, what's unjust?

814
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:40,010
Have you heard of Nietzsche?

815
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,630
Is he an international lawyer?

816
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:44,550
Neither a lawyer nor an artiste.

817
00:52:45,050 --> 00:52:46,420
A philosopher.

818
00:52:47,050 --> 00:52:50,760
He came up with the term "Ubermensch".

819
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:58,920
It means a powerful, talented,
sharp Superman...

820
00:53:00,630 --> 00:53:03,340
Man-made laws, rules, society...

821
00:53:04,470 --> 00:53:06,380
He's above it all.

822
00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:09,720
He decides he wants to commit a crime.

823
00:53:11,630 --> 00:53:12,880
No one will be able to catch him.

824
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,010
He's so sharp.

825
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:17,470
Just like me.

826
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:24,550
You can do it too.

827
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:31,220
But you'll have to perform your duties
as a talented artiste and a responsible citizen.

828
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:32,590
Let's see who's next?

829
00:53:34,090 --> 00:53:36,470
Manas Saha, minister's son.

830
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,720
He's killed people while driving drunk.

831
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,380
Who's going to match it?

832
00:53:41,010 --> 00:53:42,920
The artiste will match it.

833
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,550
This is going to be Vinci Da's "Mona Lisa".

834
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:49,170
Ready?

835
00:54:12,670 --> 00:54:14,630
But I'm an artiste.

836
00:54:14,670 --> 00:54:17,760
If my work benefits someone, great.

837
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:19,800
But why should it harm someone?

838
00:54:26,050 --> 00:54:28,630
The Nobel Prize for peace...

839
00:54:30,170 --> 00:54:34,010
Do you know where Alfred Nobel
got that money from?

840
00:54:35,130 --> 00:54:39,800
By selling dynamite. Bombs. Explosive.

841
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:43,670
What does that have to do with the artiste?

842
00:54:44,050 --> 00:54:46,840
Let's start with your idol.

843
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:53,170
Have you seen Leonardo's
designs of weapons?

844
00:54:53,510 --> 00:54:57,800
Those designs can annihilate millions
of people in seconds.

845
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:00,380
Isn't that art?

846
00:55:01,090 --> 00:55:02,670
Isn't that science?

847
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:07,630
At least, the work you're doing
is helping a lot of people.

848
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:11,420
It's hurting a few.

849
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:47,800
Darling, what's wrong?

850
00:55:52,470 --> 00:55:55,590
What are you worried about?

851
00:55:55,590 --> 00:55:59,170
I think I'm trapped, Jaya.

852
00:55:59,170 --> 00:56:09,260
I don't know what I should do.
I've no idea.

853
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:11,260
What happened?

854
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,470
Tell me.

855
00:56:19,550 --> 00:56:27,010
I know that as a person you'll do the right thing
even if it's difficult.

856
00:56:27,010 --> 00:56:29,840
And as an artiste?

857
00:56:30,630 --> 00:56:42,010
- I don't get it. How is it different?
- It is different. Completely different.

858
00:56:44,050 --> 00:56:51,550
The rules of morality are not applicable
on artistes.

859
00:56:51,550 --> 00:56:56,220
Some famous artistes, writers, singers...

860
00:56:56,220 --> 00:57:00,220
Whatever their personal life might be...

861
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:02,010
that's not people's concern.

862
00:57:02,010 --> 00:57:04,300
Ultimately, it's their work
that people remember.

863
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:06,720
That's what remains, Jaya.
Isn't it?

864
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:08,840
Which singer is a wife-beater?

865
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:11,380
Which bloody cricketer has taken bribes?

866
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:13,300
Which actor is a womaniser?

867
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:15,760
No one remembers.

868
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:20,380
No one wants to remember.

869
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:22,590
What's the point?

870
00:57:22,590 --> 00:57:26,050
What are you talking about?

871
00:57:26,050 --> 00:57:28,050
I can't understand anything.

872
00:57:28,050 --> 00:57:33,880
Before this, no one else
had given me such a huge opportunity.

873
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:35,340
You know.

874
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:40,090
It's not just the money
but the work is challenging.

875
00:57:40,090 --> 00:57:45,590
He's challenged the artiste within me.
No one has done that before.

876
00:57:45,590 --> 00:57:48,800
This man gave me the opportunity
that the entire film industry couldn't.

877
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:54,880
My makeup, my prosthetics, Jaya...

878
00:57:55,170 --> 00:57:57,880
How can I let that go?

879
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:05,170
He didn't do it on purpose.

880
00:58:05,170 --> 00:58:09,420
Actually, he was in such a rush...

881
00:58:09,670 --> 00:58:14,420
Even we make mistakes in a hurry.

882
00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:19,970
Maybe, he pulled the trigger by mistake.

883
00:58:20,590 --> 00:58:23,050
And the man just got in the way.

884
00:58:24,090 --> 00:58:32,260
Yeah, got it?
He didn't do it on purpose.

885
00:58:52,510 --> 00:59:03,050
I'll be with you,
no matter what you do.

886
00:59:17,090 --> 00:59:25,760
I'm very worried about something.

887
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:28,670
What do you have to worry about?

888
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:38,760
- If one of the parents...
- Stammer.

889
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:43,920
- Will the child...
- Stammer too?

890
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:50,010
What?

891
00:59:52,760 --> 01:00:05,510
- I... Love... You...
- I love...

892
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:10,760
Me too.

893
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:29,010
The gas balloons have floated away
The blue salons look away

894
01:00:29,170 --> 01:00:34,340
Tell me where should I go

895
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:44,050
I have lost my sleep
Maybe I should take some pills

896
01:00:44,170 --> 01:00:49,340
Tell me what should I do

897
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:59,380
Hug my craziness
Adorn the tramlines with poetry

898
01:00:59,380 --> 01:01:08,550
My blunt sword lies in the pocket
Or empty it out at the next sale

899
01:01:09,010 --> 01:01:16,130
Every time I am in your neighbourhood

900
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:22,760
I gulp my discomfort down my throat

901
01:01:23,970 --> 01:01:31,170
As I walk down the steps of your dreams

902
01:01:31,510 --> 01:01:37,590
That short, stout man stands in my way

903
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:43,470
You are chasing a dream.
There's no one like that.

904
01:01:44,130 --> 01:01:45,630
You've met all the girls.

905
01:01:47,130 --> 01:01:49,050
I'm the only one left.

906
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:51,470
You can look me up too.

907
01:01:53,670 --> 01:01:54,970
It's not a dream, it's reality.

908
01:02:28,510 --> 01:02:36,010
Candle lit dinners celebrating power cuts

909
01:02:36,130 --> 01:02:41,420
Tell me should I come back for more

910
01:02:43,670 --> 01:02:51,130
The food is burning on the stove
Our drinks are fizzling out

911
01:02:51,130 --> 01:02:56,880
Tell me which one we should save first

912
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:06,300
Hug my craziness
Adorn the tramlines with poetry

913
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:13,920
My blunt sword lies in the pocket
Or empty it out at the next sale

914
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:21,050
Every time I am in your neighbourhood

915
01:03:23,050 --> 01:03:29,670
I gulp my discomfort down my throat

916
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:38,090
As I walk down the steps of your dreams

917
01:03:38,420 --> 01:03:44,510
That short, stout man stands in my way

918
01:03:47,170 --> 01:03:54,470
The gas balloons have floated away
The blue salons look away

919
01:03:54,630 --> 01:04:04,840
Tell me where should I go

920
01:04:07,220 --> 01:04:10,170
- Where's your driver, bro?
- I didn't call him.

921
01:04:10,170 --> 01:04:11,720
Hey, wait, wait, wait...

922
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:14,970
You said you're calling your driver.
Why did you cancel?

923
01:04:14,970 --> 01:04:17,550
- Please don't drive.
- Nothing is going to happen to me.

924
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:22,340
I can drive with one hand...

925
01:04:22,510 --> 01:04:24,550
In fact, I drive better when I'm drunk.

926
01:04:24,550 --> 01:04:27,050
- Bro, it's already happened once...
- Get out of my way.

927
01:04:27,220 --> 01:04:31,050
Why are you looking for trouble, bro?

928
01:04:31,220 --> 01:04:32,300
What did you just say?

929
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:35,760
Nothing... Why don't you give me the keys?

930
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:37,420
I'll drop you home.

931
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:39,590
Why are you doing this?

932
01:04:40,010 --> 01:04:43,970
Have you forgotten my name and my surname?

933
01:04:44,970 --> 01:04:46,800
Nothing ever happens to me.

934
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:48,260
What does that mean?

935
01:04:48,340 --> 01:04:50,010
Nothing can happen to me.

936
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:52,470
Bro, I have the best intentions in mind.

937
01:04:52,470 --> 01:04:55,470
Those girls are waiting for you.
Go ahead.

938
01:04:55,470 --> 01:04:59,130
Drive carefully, bro.

939
01:04:59,420 --> 01:05:01,920
- I'll drop you.
- Just shut up.

940
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:04,550
Bro...

941
01:05:05,380 --> 01:05:07,380
Bro, be careful...

942
01:05:15,220 --> 01:05:16,340
What the...

943
01:05:55,380 --> 01:05:57,840
Hello, sir!
Sir?

944
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:01,470
- Sir?
- Yeah.

945
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:03,050
Do you need some help?

946
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:06,630
Yeah... Please come here.

947
01:06:07,170 --> 01:06:08,380
Please, please...

948
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:12,470
Thank you...
Bloody irresponsible people...

949
01:06:12,470 --> 01:06:14,590
- Wonder who does these...
- Very irresponsible...

950
01:06:38,470 --> 01:06:40,380
The party is not over yet.

951
01:06:41,260 --> 01:06:44,590
The party has just started...

952
01:06:53,130 --> 01:06:58,220
It's the time to disco...

953
01:09:09,550 --> 01:09:10,760
Were you sleeping?

954
01:09:20,090 --> 01:09:20,720
How did it go?

955
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:23,090
It went according to the plan.

956
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:25,720
It was a good thing
you did the makeup on hands.

957
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:27,880
He was wearing a half sleeves shirt.

958
01:09:29,510 --> 01:09:31,670
This prosthetic thing...

959
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:33,970
Even I don't know what happens to me.

960
01:09:34,050 --> 01:09:36,170
I become a different person.

961
01:09:36,220 --> 01:09:38,380
Your work is something else!

962
01:09:39,090 --> 01:09:41,170
Everything else was fine.

963
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:43,550
Absolutely perfect.

964
01:09:43,670 --> 01:09:46,090
It's a such huge job,
there will be some hiccups.

965
01:09:46,170 --> 01:09:49,260
There could have been a big accident
while I was trying to drive into the divider.

966
01:09:49,260 --> 01:09:50,670
I could have died.

967
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:52,420
I just drove over...

968
01:09:53,510 --> 01:09:54,470
He is a big guy.

969
01:09:54,470 --> 01:09:58,170
I hurt my back, lifting him up.

970
01:09:58,260 --> 01:09:59,510
But that's okay.

971
01:09:59,670 --> 01:10:01,590
I had to block the road with bricks.

972
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:03,300
It was a lot of hard work.

973
01:10:03,340 --> 01:10:07,010
The weight made it difficult.
I have a bad back.

974
01:10:07,010 --> 01:10:08,630
Otherwise, everything else was fine.

975
01:10:08,630 --> 01:10:10,420
Wiping off the finger print
is a very tedious task.

976
01:10:11,380 --> 01:10:13,010
I did that properly.

977
01:10:13,220 --> 01:10:19,090
The handles, the seats,
the steering wheel, the entire car...

978
01:10:19,550 --> 01:10:21,550
I wiped everything down carefully.

979
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:24,880
No one wears gloves while driving.

980
01:10:25,630 --> 01:10:28,510
And the gloves will be visible on the CCTV too.

981
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:30,380
It would have been a disaster.

982
01:10:30,630 --> 01:10:32,510
A complete disaster.

983
01:10:38,130 --> 01:10:40,090
Here's your advance for the next job.

984
01:10:40,130 --> 01:10:41,470
Buy the materials you need.

985
01:10:41,550 --> 01:10:44,010
I'll brief you in some time about the next job.

986
01:10:44,090 --> 01:10:46,920
Hope the net wasn't visible.

987
01:10:47,090 --> 01:10:49,090
After all you've been through...

988
01:10:49,090 --> 01:10:51,090
Hopefully, the blending didn't come off.

989
01:10:51,090 --> 01:10:52,550
I used very good adhesive.

990
01:10:52,550 --> 01:10:53,760
That I don't know.

991
01:10:54,130 --> 01:10:57,300
We'll get to know when the police watch
the CCTV footage on the big screen.

992
01:10:57,800 --> 01:11:00,840
I just concentrated on the acting.

993
01:11:03,340 --> 01:11:06,720
Hope no one was harmed this time.

994
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:10,840
Only one person was harmed.

995
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:18,420
- Manas...
- Who's asking?

996
01:11:18,420 --> 01:11:19,920
- Manas.
- Yeah.

997
01:11:22,090 --> 01:11:24,510
You have to wake up now, Manas.

998
01:11:24,510 --> 01:11:25,970
Who are you?

999
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:31,090
I'm Poddar.

1000
01:11:31,630 --> 01:11:33,090
DCDD Poddar.

1001
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:38,670
Sorry... Sorry, Inspector.

1002
01:11:45,170 --> 01:11:46,380
Why am I here?

1003
01:11:47,130 --> 01:11:48,590
How did I get here?

1004
01:11:51,220 --> 01:11:55,720
You have run over five people
while driving under the influence of alcohol.

1005
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:58,170
Then you passed out
after hitting a divider.

1006
01:11:58,340 --> 01:12:01,670
Then some responsible citizens
dropped you off here.

1007
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:03,800
Actually, they didn't want to.

1008
01:12:03,970 --> 01:12:05,840
They wanted to lynch you to death.

1009
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:08,010
My men rescued you.

1010
01:12:08,170 --> 01:12:09,920
What the hell are you saying?

1011
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:13,550
I couldn't have driven the car.
I was unconscious.

1012
01:12:13,670 --> 01:12:19,760
A man... put a cloth on my mouth...

1013
01:12:23,550 --> 01:12:27,090
Believe me, I had to get off the car once.

1014
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:33,170
How do you surround yourself
with criminals all the time?

1015
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:39,510
Last time, apparently your driver
ran over those people.

1016
01:12:40,590 --> 01:12:45,090
This time some stranger had put you out...
You're really something!

1017
01:12:46,260 --> 01:12:48,130
You don't believe me.

1018
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:54,300
I need a lawyer
and I need him right now.

1019
01:12:54,380 --> 01:12:55,880
Of course.

1020
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:57,670
We will call the lawyer once you're conscious.

1021
01:12:57,670 --> 01:12:59,420
But I'm already in my senses.

1022
01:12:59,420 --> 01:13:01,880
You're conscious now
but won't be 15 minutes later.

1023
01:13:02,510 --> 01:13:04,170
Absolutely perfect.

1024
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:07,470
The way you got away with it last time...

1025
01:13:07,470 --> 01:13:11,670
there's no guarantee that you won't get away again,
thanks to money and power.

1026
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:14,380
But this time the evidence against you
is strong.

1027
01:13:14,670 --> 01:13:16,920
There was a camera at the traffic signal.

1028
01:13:17,300 --> 01:13:18,300
Camera?

1029
01:13:18,550 --> 01:13:19,550
Yes.

1030
01:13:21,010 --> 01:13:26,800
It might take time in court
to prove that the footage is not fake.

1031
01:13:27,260 --> 01:13:29,720
That's why we're taking care of you now.

1032
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:32,090
You can't do this.

1033
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:34,130
You cannot...

1034
01:13:34,630 --> 01:13:35,630
Hey!

1035
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:38,170
Sit down!

1036
01:13:41,170 --> 01:13:43,130
You are...

1037
01:13:48,420 --> 01:13:50,670
Have you read Aesop's Fables?

1038
01:13:51,590 --> 01:13:53,760
Or have you only watched porn?

1039
01:13:54,340 --> 01:13:57,920
Remember the boy who cried wolf?

1040
01:13:58,340 --> 01:14:01,840
The shepherd...
who bluffed over and over again.

1041
01:14:03,050 --> 01:14:04,260
Remember the end?

1042
01:14:08,670 --> 01:14:10,590
This is the scene of a gruesome accident.

1043
01:14:10,590 --> 01:14:13,880
Five people sleeping on the pavement
have been run over.

1044
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:15,800
Police have cordorned off this area.

1045
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:17,970
The bodies have been removed.

1046
01:14:17,970 --> 01:14:20,090
An in depth investigation
is going on.

1047
01:14:20,090 --> 01:14:24,970
The CCTV footage from the traffic camera
is also being looked at.

1048
01:14:24,970 --> 01:14:29,050
This is the CCTV footage
where Manas Saha can be clearly seen.

1049
01:14:29,050 --> 01:14:33,420
Common people have taken to the streets
in protest against this heinous incident.

1050
01:14:33,510 --> 01:14:35,050
He can't do whatever he wants
just because he's a politician's son.

1051
01:14:35,050 --> 01:14:36,050
We demand justice!

1052
01:14:36,050 --> 01:14:37,720
This man should rot in jail.

1053
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:40,300
He got away with it last time.

1054
01:14:40,300 --> 01:14:41,800
He should be punished.

1055
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:44,470
Down with Manas Saha!
We want justice!

1056
01:14:44,670 --> 01:14:47,470
MLA Mrinmoy Saha insists
his son is innocent.

1057
01:14:47,470 --> 01:14:49,090
Here's what he had to say.

1058
01:14:49,420 --> 01:14:51,970
- Your son has been accused before?
- He was proven innocent.

1059
01:14:51,970 --> 01:14:53,130
He'll be proved innocent again.

1060
01:14:53,130 --> 01:14:55,720
We have CCTV footage
that shows he is guilty.

1061
01:14:55,720 --> 01:14:56,550
It's fake.

1062
01:14:56,550 --> 01:15:01,010
Even though, MLA Saha disagrees,
his son can be seen on the CCTV footage.

1063
01:15:01,010 --> 01:15:05,300
Manas Saha got away last time
for the lack of evidence.

1064
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:07,880
We have very strong evidence this time.

1065
01:15:08,010 --> 01:15:10,170
That's why it'll be difficult for him.

1066
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:11,670
Easily IPC Section...

1067
01:15:11,670 --> 01:15:13,380
304A...

1068
01:15:13,380 --> 01:15:15,260
279...

1069
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:16,760
337...

1070
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:18,340
338...

1071
01:15:18,340 --> 01:15:23,760
427 and read with 181, 185
of motor vehicles act of 1980...

1072
01:15:24,090 --> 01:15:26,920
We're charging him
under all these sections.

1073
01:15:27,550 --> 01:15:29,050
Good.

1074
01:15:34,590 --> 01:15:40,010
Manas Saha is involved in a hit and run case
that killed five people.

1075
01:15:41,010 --> 01:15:45,260
He even tried to destroy the traffic camera.

1076
01:15:45,510 --> 01:15:50,380
Common people are protesting
the deaths of the poor people.

1077
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:53,010
The police have blocked the area.

1078
01:15:53,010 --> 01:15:58,510
The cyber forensic team is verifying
the authenticity of the CCTV footage.

1079
01:15:58,510 --> 01:16:02,880
This is the second time Manas Saha
is involved in a hit and run case.

1080
01:16:04,470 --> 01:16:07,510
Manas Saha has been arrested.

1081
01:16:07,590 --> 01:16:10,380
He's being held for questioning
for the last 24 hours.

1082
01:16:10,380 --> 01:16:15,170
DCDD Poddar was unavailable
for comments.

1083
01:16:46,630 --> 01:16:50,760
Sir, please buy some incense sticks.

1084
01:16:51,300 --> 01:16:53,380
Please, sir.

1085
01:16:53,590 --> 01:16:54,970
I don't want.

1086
01:16:54,970 --> 01:16:58,260
This is not a market.
This is an accident site.

1087
01:16:58,380 --> 01:17:00,800
It's very cheap.
Please buy one.

1088
01:17:03,010 --> 01:17:05,840
- How much is it for?
- Rs. 10.

1089
01:17:16,550 --> 01:17:17,670
Take it.

1090
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:31,260
I bought your incense stick.
Why are you crying?

1091
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:39,550
Someone drove a car over my father.

1092
01:17:39,550 --> 01:17:43,970
It was really hot.
So, he had come to sleep here.

1093
01:17:51,170 --> 01:17:53,800
Hey, wait.

1094
01:18:00,380 --> 01:18:01,760
Keep this.

1095
01:18:03,220 --> 01:18:05,880
Take this money.

1096
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:09,800
- Please take it.
- I don't want it. I don't need it.

1097
01:18:11,260 --> 01:18:11,970
Where do you live?

1098
01:18:21,220 --> 01:18:25,630
Mom, this gentleman wanted to meet you.

1099
01:18:30,340 --> 01:18:31,720
I...

1100
01:18:33,470 --> 01:18:36,470
Wanted to give him...

1101
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:38,800
some money...

1102
01:18:40,590 --> 01:18:43,720
But he didn't want to take it.

1103
01:18:45,340 --> 01:18:50,090
I wanted to give it to you...

1104
01:18:50,090 --> 01:18:51,220
Why?

1105
01:18:51,340 --> 01:18:58,220
Because of the accident...

1106
01:18:58,220 --> 01:19:01,050
I wanted to help...

1107
01:19:01,630 --> 01:19:03,840
We don't need your money.

1108
01:19:04,170 --> 01:19:06,420
Please take some incense sticks
if you want.

1109
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:33,260
You can't say no.

1110
01:19:34,550 --> 01:19:36,130
This is the last one.

1111
01:19:36,340 --> 01:19:38,050
We'll be done after that.

1112
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:42,380
You have to work really hard
on this Saturday's makeup.

1113
01:19:43,050 --> 01:19:48,090
- No.
- Look at you being all pricey.

1114
01:19:48,380 --> 01:19:50,550
I know you're a great artiste.

1115
01:19:51,090 --> 01:19:52,760
What do you want?

1116
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:53,970
More money.

1117
01:19:54,130 --> 01:19:58,720
I don't want any money.
I'm not an artiste. I want nothing!

1118
01:20:00,470 --> 01:20:04,840
How strange! The great Vinci Da is saying
he's not an artiste.

1119
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:06,840
What's wrong with you?

1120
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:11,630
I can't kill any more.

1121
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:19,090
Why are you so stressed out?

1122
01:20:19,420 --> 01:20:21,470
You're not the one kiling them.

1123
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:23,920
I'm killing them.

1124
01:20:24,970 --> 01:20:28,880
Do you have a problem when an animal
is sacrificed at the altar of God?

1125
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:33,300
That's what this is.

1126
01:20:33,670 --> 01:20:35,420
This is sacrifice.

1127
01:20:35,670 --> 01:20:40,170
How will we pacify the God of Law
without sacrifice?

1128
01:20:45,170 --> 01:20:47,300
You are crazy.

1129
01:20:48,090 --> 01:20:49,090
You are sick.

1130
01:20:49,090 --> 01:20:51,300
You are mad!

1131
01:20:52,420 --> 01:20:56,380
Yes but there's a method
to the madness.

1132
01:20:56,380 --> 01:20:59,470
If you continue your drama...

1133
01:20:59,470 --> 01:21:03,760
I'll tell the cops that you're the mastermind
behind these crimes.

1134
01:21:04,470 --> 01:21:06,380
It's a high profile case.

1135
01:21:06,380 --> 01:21:09,800
My victims will be more than happy
to get a witness.

1136
01:21:10,130 --> 01:21:13,970
There are no videos of me wearing
or taking off the masks.

1137
01:21:13,970 --> 01:21:18,130
But you're in videos making Shyamsundar
and Manas' masks.

1138
01:21:18,170 --> 01:21:21,050
I have lots of videos.

1139
01:21:27,380 --> 01:21:31,340
What's my fault?
Please let me go.

1140
01:21:31,340 --> 01:21:33,220
Please let me go.

1141
01:21:33,220 --> 01:21:39,090
I haven't harmed you.
Why are you doing this to me?

1142
01:21:41,170 --> 01:21:43,380
This is the last case.

1143
01:21:44,170 --> 01:21:46,010
That's it.

1144
01:21:47,300 --> 01:21:51,760
Time for "The Last Supper".

1145
01:21:56,470 --> 01:22:00,340
Please don't betray me
at the last moment like Judas.

1146
01:22:00,590 --> 01:22:02,340
Please...

1147
01:22:02,590 --> 01:22:05,630
After the job is done
I'll give you the videos.

1148
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:08,880
You can watch it on your day off.

1149
01:22:14,170 --> 01:22:15,470
Reference.

1150
01:22:15,510 --> 01:22:19,010
Sunny Sen, page three celebrity, known rapist.

1151
01:22:26,470 --> 01:22:31,170
Have you ever seen the eyes
of a listless, trapped mouse?

1152
01:22:31,170 --> 01:22:40,010
It knows the moment the mouse trap
is opened like a reverse guillotine...

1153
01:22:40,010 --> 01:22:47,300
Hundreds of crows will swoop in and relish
it's entrails like cheap roadside snack.

1154
01:22:48,130 --> 01:22:50,380
That's how I felt.

1155
01:22:50,760 --> 01:22:53,090
There was nowhere to run.

1156
01:22:53,340 --> 01:22:57,920
Either the cops will get me
or the crazy Adi Bose will kill me.

1157
01:22:58,380 --> 01:23:04,300
Or I'll kill myself, guilty of having
innocent blood on my hands.

1158
01:23:04,630 --> 01:23:06,340
But still...

1159
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:10,340
Even though I'm telling the story
in this deep, sombre voice...

1160
01:23:10,630 --> 01:23:14,090
the story was being written by someone else.

1161
01:23:14,630 --> 01:23:16,510
The one who writes all the stories.

1162
01:23:16,970 --> 01:23:19,380
The person sitting up above.

1163
01:24:21,670 --> 01:24:22,800
Who are you?

1164
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:25,670
Go away... Go away!

1165
01:24:26,010 --> 01:24:28,010
Leave me alone...
I haven't done anything.

1166
01:24:28,010 --> 01:24:30,550
Get out of here.

1167
01:24:30,550 --> 01:24:32,340
I haven't killed anyone.
Why is there so much blood?

1168
01:24:32,340 --> 01:24:36,470
Go away...
Get out!!!

1169
01:24:36,670 --> 01:24:38,800
I haven't killed anyone.

1170
01:25:04,300 --> 01:25:05,880
How long has it been circulating?

1171
01:25:06,170 --> 01:25:07,510
Since yesterday.

1172
01:25:07,510 --> 01:25:09,130
Have you searched Sunny Sen's home?

1173
01:25:09,130 --> 01:25:10,300
Yes, sir.

1174
01:25:10,420 --> 01:25:12,420
We've found a lot of discriminating videos.

1175
01:25:12,630 --> 01:25:16,840
He has filmed himself too.

1176
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:19,260
The man is mentally disturbed.
He's psychotic.

1177
01:25:19,260 --> 01:25:20,970
He's disgusting.

1178
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:24,340
Bring it to me on a pen drive.

1179
01:25:27,050 --> 01:25:28,470
Go on.

1180
01:25:29,130 --> 01:25:32,550
Sir... I have it.

1181
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:36,550
Someone forwarded it.
Would you like to take a look?

1182
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:53,420
Who sent it to you?

1183
01:25:54,800 --> 01:26:00,920
One of my college friends...

1184
01:26:06,420 --> 01:26:08,340
Ask the bugger to come here.

1185
01:26:09,470 --> 01:26:12,090
Let me introduce him to the Cyber cell.

1186
01:26:13,220 --> 01:26:16,760
And please don't call disgusting people
like these your friends.

1187
01:26:17,670 --> 01:26:21,010
Otherwise, you'll be in trouble too.
Understood?

1188
01:26:21,970 --> 01:26:23,340
Understood?

1189
01:26:23,340 --> 01:26:26,800
- Yes, sir.
- Get out. Get out!

1190
01:26:31,260 --> 01:26:32,970
And delete that video!

1191
01:26:32,970 --> 01:26:36,510
I heard Sunny Sen got very badly beaten up
in the lock up.

1192
01:26:36,510 --> 01:26:41,720
Apparently, some of his nerves
were permanently damaged.

1193
01:26:42,550 --> 01:26:45,970
But he got out on bail.
Thanks to his contacts.

1194
01:26:46,300 --> 01:26:50,550
Although, by then his personal life
was already falling apart.

1195
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:53,880
Sunny's father-in-law
was a very influential man.

1196
01:26:53,920 --> 01:27:00,010
Sunny's wife filed for divorce
and took full custody of his children.

1197
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:02,970
This case was pending already.

1198
01:27:03,340 --> 01:27:07,800
Although, his lawyer tried to prove
that the videos were fake...

1199
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:09,720
forensics found no proof
in support of the claim.

1200
01:27:09,720 --> 01:27:13,920
Adi Bose destroyed Sunny Sen's life.

1201
01:27:14,470 --> 01:27:19,970
Unknowingly, he had destroyed another life.

1202
01:27:21,050 --> 01:27:22,470
Mine.

1203
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:29,470
I'm so happy that you've finally come home.

1204
01:27:31,670 --> 01:27:34,760
You don't look like someone
who parties a lot.

1205
01:27:35,380 --> 01:27:38,630
An occasional drink for the artiste.
That's it.

1206
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:43,130
I don't go out much.

1207
01:27:43,130 --> 01:27:44,720
Work keeps me busy.

1208
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:47,220
But it's a special occasion.

1209
01:27:47,470 --> 01:27:49,630
- And your list...
- No formalities, please...

1210
01:27:50,170 --> 01:27:53,880
Right... Your list is done.

1211
01:27:54,510 --> 01:27:56,300
And I'm done too.

1212
01:27:56,510 --> 01:27:59,630
It's over...
All the work.

1213
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:03,050
So, I was saying...

1214
01:28:03,260 --> 01:28:05,510
- So?
- That...

1215
01:28:05,970 --> 01:28:09,970
If I can get the videos and photos...

1216
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:12,920
I mean...

1217
01:28:14,170 --> 01:28:17,760
You know I thought about it a lot.

1218
01:28:19,380 --> 01:28:20,800
It's safe with me.

1219
01:28:23,970 --> 01:28:28,380
I'll keep it like a memento.

1220
01:28:33,420 --> 01:28:36,670
Only the prosthetic list is over.

1221
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:39,550
But the list of criminals is long.

1222
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:41,470
There's so much more to do.

1223
01:28:41,470 --> 01:28:43,800
You're done but I'm not.

1224
01:28:43,800 --> 01:28:45,970
There's so much more to do.

1225
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:49,340
The laws...

1226
01:28:51,090 --> 01:28:55,670
So many people are breaking the law
and getting away with it.

1227
01:28:56,010 --> 01:28:58,510
Let's say you suddenly get mad at me.

1228
01:28:58,510 --> 01:29:01,260
And you take a trip to the police station.

1229
01:29:03,420 --> 01:29:08,260
And one story might lead to another...

1230
01:29:10,420 --> 01:29:14,050
Then, my "Clean Society Mission"
will be in danger.

1231
01:29:14,300 --> 01:29:15,630
So, let it be with me.

1232
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:19,050
What's this?

1233
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:26,630
Like you said...

1234
01:29:26,920 --> 01:29:28,300
Memento.

1235
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:36,010
I bought it from a little boy
on the streets.

1236
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:38,720
You burn incense while drinking?

1237
01:29:38,720 --> 01:29:42,090
Is that some strange artiste's ritual?

1238
01:29:47,970 --> 01:29:52,920
That girl who...

1239
01:29:53,050 --> 01:29:54,590
Did you know her?

1240
01:29:54,590 --> 01:29:57,920
No, random.
I picked up the first girl I saw.

1241
01:29:59,010 --> 01:30:01,470
Not someone I knew.

1242
01:30:08,220 --> 01:30:09,920
Collateral damage...
I told you.

1243
01:30:09,970 --> 01:30:13,720
- Collateral...
- Yeah, collateral damage.

1244
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:18,670
What about Sunny Sen's lawyer?

1245
01:30:18,760 --> 01:30:23,920
What if he orders for medical tests?

1246
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:27,050
The marks are still there.

1247
01:30:27,260 --> 01:30:31,260
He can prove that it wasn't Sunny Sen.

1248
01:30:31,260 --> 01:30:32,050
What happens then?

1249
01:30:32,050 --> 01:30:35,220
There'll be a lot of trouble.

1250
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:42,050
I use gloves when I murder someone.

1251
01:30:42,970 --> 01:30:45,800
I used a condom when I raped the girl.

1252
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:47,510
Condom?

1253
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:52,470
What's wrong with you?

1254
01:30:53,130 --> 01:30:54,470
Are you okay?

1255
01:30:55,630 --> 01:30:56,920
Okay?

1256
01:30:58,840 --> 01:31:03,220
My drink is a little too stiff.
Can I get some water?

1257
01:31:03,220 --> 01:31:06,300
- Water?
- It's over.

1258
01:31:07,010 --> 01:31:08,470
I'll get it right away.

1259
01:31:19,630 --> 01:31:22,090
Why did you ask me to meet here?

1260
01:31:23,260 --> 01:31:25,170
What are you doing?

1261
01:31:28,010 --> 01:31:29,300
What's that?

1262
01:31:30,420 --> 01:31:33,470
Have you lost your mind?

1263
01:31:33,970 --> 01:31:37,670
What do you want me to see?

1264
01:31:38,010 --> 01:31:39,550
What do you have on your mobile...

1265
01:32:03,380 --> 01:32:06,300
This is an accident.

1266
01:32:06,670 --> 01:32:10,090
How is it your fault?

1267
01:32:10,090 --> 01:32:13,300
Accidents happen.

1268
01:32:16,720 --> 01:32:20,300
Jaya, this is not your fault.

1269
01:32:20,300 --> 01:32:23,550
This video is an accident, Jaya.

1270
01:32:24,090 --> 01:32:27,590
This is an accident!

1271
01:32:27,590 --> 01:32:35,130
Then why are people blaming me?
Everyone...

1272
01:32:37,260 --> 01:32:38,970
What am I going to do now?

1273
01:32:38,970 --> 01:32:40,260
Why are you giving them importance?

1274
01:32:40,550 --> 01:32:46,050
You don't have to pay attention
to what people say.

1275
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:49,920
They're idiots
if they think it's your fault.

1276
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:54,970
If anyone looks at you,
I'll blind them.

1277
01:32:55,130 --> 01:32:56,920
Please calm down.

1278
01:32:56,920 --> 01:33:00,380
Where are you going?

1279
01:33:00,970 --> 01:33:02,260
I'm asking you to stop.

1280
01:33:02,260 --> 01:33:05,220
Stop! What are you doing?

1281
01:33:05,800 --> 01:33:08,800
Have you gone mad?
What are you doing?

1282
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:10,380
What was in your hand?

1283
01:33:11,010 --> 01:33:12,970
Jaya!

1284
01:33:14,090 --> 01:33:18,920
I don't want to live anymore.

1285
01:33:19,420 --> 01:33:22,510
I want to die...

1286
01:33:22,510 --> 01:33:26,260
Have you gone mad?
Why do you want to die?

1287
01:33:26,720 --> 01:33:29,590
People don't remember these things.
They forget.

1288
01:33:30,300 --> 01:33:34,260
It's just going to be you and me.
Just us.

1289
01:33:34,760 --> 01:33:40,050
We'll live with our heads held high, Jaya.

1290
01:33:40,260 --> 01:33:45,420
I will always respect you.

1291
01:33:45,420 --> 01:33:50,880
Your body has nothing to do with your honour.

1292
01:33:51,090 --> 01:33:54,670
We'll go somewhere far away.

1293
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:59,380
Why should you cry?
Why should you be ashamed?

1294
01:33:59,380 --> 01:34:02,630
Why should you pay for the crime
you didn't commit?

1295
01:34:02,630 --> 01:34:08,010
The criminal will be punished.

1296
01:35:36,420 --> 01:35:39,090
Sir, this is an open and shut case.

1297
01:35:39,300 --> 01:35:41,470
That's what the video evidence is saying.

1298
01:35:41,470 --> 01:35:44,720
- He had a criminal record, right?
- Yes, sir.

1299
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:50,300
He was psychologically damaged.
Murdered his father as a boy.

1300
01:35:50,670 --> 01:35:56,920
There are fingerprints on the glass.
His laptop is at the cyber forensic cell.

1301
01:35:59,800 --> 01:36:04,720
- Everything is okay but...
- But what, sir?

1302
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:08,220
I've seen this man before.

1303
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:10,470
He looks familiar.

1304
01:36:10,760 --> 01:36:12,340
- Where?
- At the police station.

1305
01:36:12,340 --> 01:36:14,170
At the police station?

1306
01:36:16,590 --> 01:36:20,970
Oh! I remember now!

1307
01:36:20,970 --> 01:36:25,630
I met him at your station.

1308
01:36:27,050 --> 01:36:29,220
- Bapi, you were there too.
- Yes, sir.

1309
01:36:29,220 --> 01:36:34,670
That... Pickpocket...
Beaten up by the mob...

1310
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:35,720
Remember, Bapi?

1311
01:36:35,720 --> 01:36:36,840
Yes, sir.

1312
01:36:36,840 --> 01:36:38,510
Right, sir. He was there.

1313
01:36:38,970 --> 01:36:45,420
He went on about Law
like a mad man.

1314
01:36:45,970 --> 01:36:47,630
Mad man.

1315
01:36:48,380 --> 01:36:50,920
But Law comes before everyone, sir.

1316
01:36:51,050 --> 01:36:52,760
Life and death are secondary.

1317
01:36:53,130 --> 01:36:56,800
The confession confirms the mental illness.

1318
01:36:58,970 --> 01:37:01,300
Something isn't adding up.

1319
01:37:02,760 --> 01:37:05,470
Something is out of place.

1320
01:37:11,220 --> 01:37:12,670
What's wrong with you?

1321
01:37:12,670 --> 01:37:14,130
Is everything okay?

1322
01:37:15,130 --> 01:37:16,590
Okay?

1323
01:37:18,550 --> 01:37:22,760
My drink is a little too stiff.
Can I get some water?

1324
01:37:22,760 --> 01:37:25,670
- Water?
- Yeah, it's over.

1325
01:37:26,380 --> 01:37:28,050
I'll get it right away.

1326
01:38:03,420 --> 01:38:09,760
Vinci Da, don't know what I would do
without you.

1327
01:38:10,630 --> 01:38:13,420
I wouldn't be able to become
a successful lawyer.

1328
01:38:15,220 --> 01:38:19,260
- Lawyer?
- Yes, lawyer.

1329
01:38:19,260 --> 01:38:21,050
What do lawyers do?

1330
01:38:22,170 --> 01:38:27,420
Lawyers bring criminals to justice.

1331
01:38:28,260 --> 01:38:30,170
That's what I do.

1332
01:38:31,630 --> 01:38:35,380
My friends used to play cops and crooks.

1333
01:38:35,800 --> 01:38:38,050
I went a step further.

1334
01:38:38,590 --> 01:38:43,670
Crooks... Cops...
Lawyer.

1335
01:38:45,260 --> 01:38:48,550
Needless to say,
I would play the lawyer.

1336
01:38:49,380 --> 01:38:52,380
Everything must be taken to court.

1337
01:38:52,380 --> 01:38:54,050
We used to play a game too.

1338
01:38:54,260 --> 01:38:55,670
Crooks and cops?

1339
01:38:57,760 --> 01:38:59,590
A little more than that.

1340
01:39:01,380 --> 01:39:03,220
Crooks, cops and lawyer?

1341
01:39:04,340 --> 01:39:08,670
Ubermenschen think alike.

1342
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:10,920
A little more.

1343
01:39:16,220 --> 01:39:17,670
What's that?

1344
01:39:18,840 --> 01:39:21,760
Crooks, cops, lawyer...

1345
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:24,550
Judge and Executioner.

1346
01:39:28,470 --> 01:39:31,590
- Which character did you play?
- Double role.

1347
01:39:32,300 --> 01:39:35,090
Judge and Executioner.

1348
01:40:50,420 --> 01:40:52,380
I am Adi Bose.

1349
01:40:54,380 --> 01:40:56,590
In sound mind...

1350
01:40:57,340 --> 01:40:59,590
Without any provocation from anyone...

1351
01:41:01,130 --> 01:41:03,470
is committing suicide.

1352
01:41:06,630 --> 01:41:12,470
The only one responsible
for my death is me...

1353
01:41:13,880 --> 01:41:16,510
and my guilt.

1354
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:24,550
I've always been unhappy.

1355
01:41:25,510 --> 01:41:30,550
That's why I wanted everyone else
to be unhappy too.

1356
01:41:32,420 --> 01:41:34,920
I've killed many people.

1357
01:41:36,470 --> 01:41:38,340
I've tortured many more.

1358
01:41:38,970 --> 01:41:40,880
I didn't even spare my father.

1359
01:41:43,670 --> 01:41:48,170
I'm mentally ill.

1360
01:41:50,670 --> 01:41:53,380
I'm a threat to the society.

1361
01:41:55,590 --> 01:41:57,470
That's why...

1362
01:41:59,220 --> 01:42:01,300
I'll get going now.

1363
01:44:09,800 --> 01:44:13,010
Coming to you live today
like I did yesterday.

1364
01:44:13,340 --> 01:44:17,130
Wasting time with nonsense.

1365
01:44:17,130 --> 01:44:20,630
But there's a difference.

1366
01:44:20,920 --> 01:44:22,130
I'm Adi Bose.

1367
01:44:22,130 --> 01:44:22,720
Adi Bose.

1368
01:44:22,720 --> 01:44:26,170
There's a difference between us.

1369
01:44:26,170 --> 01:44:27,170
The voice.

1370
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:31,300
- It's the voice... The voice...
- What, sir?

1371
01:44:33,170 --> 01:44:34,300
- Bapi?
- Yes, sir?

1372
01:44:34,300 --> 01:44:37,670
- Have you scanned the victim's laptop?
- In process.

1373
01:44:39,420 --> 01:44:41,380
Turn the car around!

1374
01:44:41,380 --> 01:44:43,920
- Hurry up.
- Now!

1375
01:44:46,470 --> 01:44:51,050
Hello, have you traced the chip?

1376
01:44:51,050 --> 01:44:53,670
I need the IP address.

1377
01:44:53,670 --> 01:44:58,970
Yes, the mobile's IP address.
Keep me updated.

1378
01:45:10,130 --> 01:45:13,170
- Bapi, take a print of this.
- Yes, sir.

1379
01:45:13,170 --> 01:45:14,630
Make a poster
and put it up all across the city.

1380
01:45:14,630 --> 01:45:17,630
- Get it done now!
- Okay, sir.

1381
01:45:30,970 --> 01:45:32,470
Can I see your ticket?

1382
01:45:38,720 --> 01:45:39,920
Tickets?

1383
01:45:42,010 --> 01:45:44,340
Ma'am, show me your ticket.

1384
01:45:52,840 --> 01:45:54,670
Where are you going?

1385
01:45:58,090 --> 01:46:00,510
Jabbalpur.

1386
01:46:01,470 --> 01:46:07,970
Stop fidgeting and look at me

1387
01:46:08,300 --> 01:46:13,420
What do you feel like doing?
What do you want?

1388
01:46:15,130 --> 01:46:21,720
Tell me about your experiences

1389
01:46:22,050 --> 01:46:28,420
What has life taught you?

1390
01:46:28,420 --> 01:46:35,380
The colours of the grass is bursting
The smell of the wet earth is calling

1391
01:46:35,720 --> 01:46:43,840
Close your eyes and breathe it all in

1392
01:46:44,670 --> 01:47:00,300
Calm down, calm down, calm down

1393
01:47:27,590 --> 01:47:34,130
Stand under the piercing sunlight

1394
01:47:34,420 --> 01:47:40,670
Only silence all around

1395
01:47:41,260 --> 01:47:47,340
Your identity melts away in thin air

1396
01:47:47,760 --> 01:47:54,550
But don't lose your self

1397
01:47:55,050 --> 01:48:01,380
People who have written your epitaph

1398
01:48:01,800 --> 01:48:08,220
They don't know the whole story

1399
01:48:08,630 --> 01:48:14,760
When you hear the call of the skies

1400
01:48:15,220 --> 01:48:25,010
Don't give it all away

1401
01:48:25,800 --> 01:48:42,340
Calm down, calm down, calm down

1402
01:49:08,300 --> 01:49:14,800
Stop fidgeting and look at me

1403
01:49:15,130 --> 01:49:21,760
What do you feel like doing?
What do you want?

1404
01:49:22,010 --> 01:49:28,970
The colours of the grass is bursting
The smell of the wet earth is calling

1405
01:49:28,970 --> 01:49:37,420
Close your eyes and breathe it all in

1406
01:49:37,800 --> 01:50:09,300
Calm down, calm down, calm down
