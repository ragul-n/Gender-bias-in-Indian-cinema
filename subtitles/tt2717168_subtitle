{ Rockers }

2
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,005
Who?

3
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:57,182
My name is J C Daniel.

4
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,076
OK.

5
00:06:58,284 --> 00:07:02,812
l'd written a letter to Mr Phalke
and l got a reply from him.

6
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:07,549
Can l meet Mr Phalke?

7
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,927
Please come in.

HORIZON

9
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:52,732
Yes? l am Phalke.

10
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:56,471
lt's a great
privilege to meet you, sir,

11
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:58,271
the pioneer of lndian cinema.

12
00:07:58,845 --> 00:07:59,777
Please be seated.

13
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:02,178
Come, sit.
- Thank you, sir.

14
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:08,313
l am J C Daniel. l've
come from Travancore,

15
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:09,680
the southern part of lndia

16
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:11,120
OK.

17
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:13,319
How can l help you?

18
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:17,191
Sir, l want to make a motion picture.

19
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:20,594
How much do you know
about motion pictures?

20
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,233
Not much, sir, but for
the past two years...

21
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:25,735
l've only been dreaming of cinema.

22
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:27,929
l've gone through books, articles...

23
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:31,142
l really want to know
more about this art, sir.

24
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:33,267
lt's not easy.

25
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,113
l understand, sir.
But can you help me?

26
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:41,076
Sorry, Mr Daniel, right now
l'm busy with my shooting.

27
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,155
You can contact
me some other time.

28
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:48,359
Sir, if it's not too much trouble,
can l watch your shooting now?

29
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:53,189
Usually, we do not allow
anybody to enter the shooting place.

30
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:56,167
But you've come a long way.

31
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,061
Come.

32
00:08:58,804 --> 00:08:59,771
Thank you, sir.

33
00:10:40,539 --> 00:11:32,751
HORIZON

34
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:36,089
Mother.

35
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:47,764
This is film.

36
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:51,905
The white man calls it 'celluloid.'

37
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:57,680
Rememberthe day you took me
to 'Capitol' to see the movie...?

38
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:00,283
l asked you how the people moved?

39
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,211
That's the technique of movies.

40
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:07,258
When the Lumiere Brothers first
screened their cinema in Paris...

41
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:11,853
people ran for their lives,
thinking the moving train was real.

42
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:16,832
Janet, cinema is a wonder.

43
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:19,328
That's what we're going to make.

44
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:23,875
Somehow, l don't feel confident.
Have you really studied it?

45
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:25,635
Yeah, l have been studying it.

46
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,410
Thirty years have passed
since films were shot in...

47
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:29,708
- Europe and America.

48
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:31,274
Fifteen years back,

49
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,975
Dundiraj Govind Phalke
made a movie in Bombay.

50
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:37,316
ln Madras, Nataraj Muthaliyar and
others have made films in Tamil.

51
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:42,050
To this day, no one in Travancore
and Cochin has been able to do it.

52
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:45,323
That is what this J C
Daniel is going to make.

53
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:47,724
You wait and see.

54
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:51,801
Your J C Daniel will become
Malayalam's first film maker.

55
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:53,800
May God help you.

56
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:57,367
But then, won't you
need lots of cash?

57
00:12:57,743 --> 00:12:58,539
Certainly.

58
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:05,408
Have to buy a camera and other
equipment, hire actors and crew.

59
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:09,015
Will require about a lakh.

60
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:13,851
Then you can just lie on
your back looking at the sky...

61
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:16,189
and hope angels rain you with cash.

62
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:22,966
l'm going to sell our property
at Neyyattinkara and ...

63
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:23,864
-Agastheeshwaram.

64
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:27,028
Didn't you sell part of it
for your timber business?

65
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:29,169
Mother won't allow it again.

66
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:31,466
lt's Papa's share of
ancestral property.

67
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:34,008
Your brothers also will not allow.

68
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:37,778
Whoever agrees or
disagrees... l have already decided.

69
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:43,946
Won't you agree?
This is my great dream.

70
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:48,020
lt's when we dream a lot
that one of them comes true.

71
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:11,007
l am willing to
sacrifice my life for you, Lord.

72
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,608
No, Peter.

73
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:18,112
l am telling the truth to
you and to your friends.

74
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:21,987
Surely, this night before
the rooster crows, ...

75
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:22,821
- you will deny me thrice.

76
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:24,724
No, Lord, l will never deny you.

77
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:30,829
lf l have to die with you,
l will not deny you.

78
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,571
lt's a play for the church feast,
'The Life of Christ.'

79
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:37,264
lt's a long time
since l saw you, Daniel.

80
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:38,941
l was on tour.

81
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:42,877
This is Sundara Rajan, my relative,
Dr Mathias' nephew.

82
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,379
Owns three four shops in the Chala.

83
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:45,813
l am Johnson. Have we met before?

84
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:48,519
Your face looks familiar.

85
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:51,985
You had a play at Chala last April.

86
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:54,952
Didn't you keep
your props in my shop?

87
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:58,024
l had told you then that you
excelled as John the Baptist.

88
00:14:58,163 --> 00:15:00,757
That's it. Now l remember.

89
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,164
So, Daniel, how are things?

90
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:04,700
Hurry with your rehearsal.

91
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,267
l have a certain matter with you.

92
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:08,303
My God, make a film!

93
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:10,031
Only Englishmen know it.

94
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:11,506
ls it a job meant for us?

95
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:13,201
Why can't we?

96
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:16,878
l've come from Bombay and Madras
after seeing and understanding it.

97
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:19,846
lt is not like staging a play.

98
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:22,413
lt uses camera
and other equipments.

99
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:23,847
What do you say about it?

100
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:26,591
l too had doubts when
l first heard about it.

101
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,121
But then Daniel convinced
me that if the Hindi people

102
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,923
and Tamil people can
do it, why not us?

103
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:33,265
We can, Johnson.

104
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:35,956
Both of you should be with me.

105
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,799
Think it through. lt's
an expensive affair.

106
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:42,696
Not like staging the 'Life of Christ.'

107
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:46,134
Once l decide,
there's no going back.

108
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:47,642
You know how l am.

109
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:49,942
What Papa got as his share,

110
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:53,607
and what's in Janet's
name will exceed 100 acres...

111
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:54,411
- of palm groves,
homesteads and fields.

112
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:58,187
lf it's 1000 British
'Chakras' for an acre,

113
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:00,324
l will get a minimum of one lakh.

114
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:03,821
As soon as the cash comes in,
l will start, my dear Johnson...

115
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:06,629
Travancore's first motion picture.

116
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:24,648
{ Rockers }

117
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:28,887
Someone has come to
see you from Travancore.

118
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:30,186
Who?

119
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:32,621
Don't know. But he's been
waiting for quite a while.

120
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:34,589
Tell him there's no role right now.

121
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:37,487
lt's not that. lt's about
some production matters.

122
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:39,892
What production-criduction?

123
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:44,259
Hello sir.

124
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:49,032
Where did you get that Krishna?
Good-for-nothing!

125
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:49,799
Hello sir.

126
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:54,444
Hey director, who is Krishnan,
who is Kuchelan?

127
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:58,810
The person acting God
must have the looks.

128
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,175
He greets me even as he acts.

129
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:02,342
How can the film be good?

130
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,419
Take one more.
- Ok.

131
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:05,855
What shall l tell that person?

132
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:07,719
Ask him to come.
- Ok.

133
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,227
Good morning sir.
Okay.

134
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:30,108
Do you know Tamil?
Yes.

135
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:31,875
Then speak in Tamil.

136
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:35,918
l had come here a few days back,
but couldn't meet you, sir.

137
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:40,188
Come to the subject.
l am coming from Travancore.

138
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:43,359
l have hopes about cinema.
l want to make a movie.

139
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:46,587
What should l do? What
equipment should l buy?

140
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:48,027
What will be the budget?

141
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,633
l have come in orderto
know all about it from you.

142
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:54,271
Do you have the money? You
will have to spend a lot.

143
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:56,570
Yes sir. l have enough money.

144
00:17:57,476 --> 00:18:01,173
Cinema is not vegetable business.

145
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:03,680
lt is for those who know about it.

146
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,907
l know a little.

147
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:09,312
Perumal, take this
person to the manager.

148
00:18:09,521 --> 00:18:11,182
Tell him to give the
information he needs.

149
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:12,221
ls it okay?
- Thank you sir.

150
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:15,552
Sir, can l also talk to your
cinematographer Mr. William Derek?

151
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:18,325
When you talk about an Engishman,
you can't talk in Tamil?

152
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:21,258
You can talk to him
during the lunch break.

153
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:27,298
Come on, have some.
Thank you.

154
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,298
Here and in Bombay
we use Debri cameras.

155
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:32,103
ln Hollywood...
they have introduced

156
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:33,838
- an advanced
version of this Debri...

157
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:35,376
but it is not available here.

158
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,677
So, where can l get a camera from?

159
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:42,376
You can get it directly from London,
or you may go to Calcutta.

160
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:47,221
There is my colleague Mr Samuel
John who has a photography shop.

161
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:51,461
He can help you get the camera
and the accessories as well.

162
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:54,092
l have a request.

163
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,267
Could you wield the
camera for my film?

164
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:57,229
Oh sorry.

165
00:18:57,569 --> 00:19:00,231
l am going back to London
after finishing this film.

166
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:04,432
Mr Samuel John will help you
find some other cinematographer.

167
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:07,446
All right. Thank you, sir.

168
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:38,040
{ Rockers }

169
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:41,710
ls it true that you are going
to make a movie, Daniel sir?.

170
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,782
True. lsn't it why l
became your disciple?

171
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:47,715
l just know how to run this film,

172
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,014
but l have no idea about the
technique behind making one.

173
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:51,019
When are you starting?

174
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:53,584
The camera and the
film have all been booked.

175
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:55,291
Will start as soon as they arrive.

176
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:58,055
Make a movie like this, Daniel sir.

177
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,664
Fed up with the Raman
andHanuman movies ...

178
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:01,663
- from Bombay and Madras

179
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:05,231
True... No mythology.

180
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:09,301
l must make my own story...
a social drama like this.

181
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:11,969
When l went to Bombay,

182
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:14,405
l saw this movie at
the Coronation theatre

183
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,939
l saw it here on the
release day as well.

184
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,510
Can't see enough of it, right?

185
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:20,276
Yes... Yes.

186
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:30,659
His name is Charlie Chaplin.

187
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:34,729
ln America, he draws more
crowds than the President.

188
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:36,525
He has such a fan-base.
- Really?

189
00:20:36,935 --> 00:21:11,125
{ Rockers }

190
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:14,035
This is the machine
used to make movies.

191
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:19,743
What's in this box?

192
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,004
Don't open it now. That is film.

193
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:25,976
When we make the movie we
load it into the camera.

194
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:28,481
Haven't you seen photos
being taken? lt's just like that.

195
00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:29,812
When do we start?

196
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:32,517
A lot of things need to be
done before that, Sundara.

197
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:35,751
First, l need to make a screen story.

198
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:39,261
lt's written in the
book called 'Photo Play.'

199
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:41,562
lt's called scenario.

200
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:47,396
The people from Bombay and
Madras mainly make mythologies.

201
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:50,503
We don't want that. First l thought...

202
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:52,870
it should be about the history of
our martial art form 'chilambattom.'

203
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:55,803
Malabar's 'kalarippayattu'
is well-known even in England.

204
00:21:55,947 --> 00:21:57,710
lsn't our
'chilambattom' quite as good?

205
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:01,716
Yet who otherthan the folks of
South Travancore know about it?

206
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:04,215
lf we make a movie on it
we can show it to all.

207
00:22:04,923 --> 00:22:07,824
But now l think we don't want that.

208
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:08,482
Why?

209
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,228
We'll make a social drama.

210
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:12,057
What?

211
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:14,596
Didn't you see Charlie
Chaplin's 'The Kid' the other day?

212
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:15,829
Like that.

213
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,796
Yeah, that will be great, Daniel.
What a fine movie!

214
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:19,732
We'll make one like it.

215
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:23,830
lsn't it a white man's story?
People here won't like that.

216
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:26,339
Can't we take a story from our Bible?

217
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:29,079
Can't we take the 'Life of Christ'?

218
00:22:29,214 --> 00:22:31,705
That's also a story from the
white man's land, Johnson.

219
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,114
We'll choose a story from
our land... a social story.

220
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:38,284
We also need a studio like
Phalke's and Muthaliar's.

221
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:42,021
lf we buy one, a lot of
cash will go that way.

222
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:43,055
Can we rent one?

223
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:47,197
l know about a
vacant building in Pattom.

224
00:22:47,432 --> 00:22:50,731
The drama company from
Madras that performed during...

225
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,860
...the last Konjiravela
festival rented that building:

226
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:55,039
Saradavilasam.
We will try that.

227
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:59,738
So, like in plays, won't
you need actors in this.

228
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:00,603
Sure.

229
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:03,112
So, l can act, can't l?

230
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:05,307
Notjust you, but l also will.

231
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:11,217
Really?
Our son Sundaram also.

232
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:19,028
You have a look.

233
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:24,828
Look.
What's this?

234
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,603
Our son is standing upside down.

235
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,234
lt must be in this. Let me see.

236
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:41,886
{ Rockers }

237
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:44,681
Don't we need a name
forthe movie, Daniel?

238
00:23:44,956 --> 00:23:46,082
Sure, we do.

239
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:48,920
lsn't our story about
a child getting lost?

240
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:53,827
Shall we name it 'The Lost Child'?
What do you say about it?

241
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:57,327
An English name? When we
Malayalis make a movie...

242
00:23:57,502 --> 00:23:58,628
it should be a Malayalam name.

243
00:23:58,804 --> 00:24:01,568
What if we call it 'Vigathakumaran'?

244
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,401
'Vigathakumaran'? What's that?

245
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:06,066
Does it have any meaning?

246
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:07,644
Yeah, 'The Lost Child.'

247
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:11,271
Really? So it means l
don't know Malayalam as well.

248
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,885
Our boy Sundaram himself will
be the lost child, won't he?

249
00:24:15,153 --> 00:24:15,619
Yes.

250
00:24:15,854 --> 00:24:19,119
He won't stay put in one place,
Daniel, then how can he?

251
00:24:19,324 --> 00:24:21,588
Any child will be a
little mischievous.

252
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,122
So our son will be
enough for the role.

253
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:25,159
He will grow up into Chandrakumar,
right?

254
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:26,531
Who will do that role?

255
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:27,927
Daniel will be doing that.

256
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:28,555
No.

257
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:33,001
l am doing Jayachandran's
role... Chandrakumar's friend.

258
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,897
ls Johnson doing
Chandrakumar's role?

259
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,600
No, we will have to look for
someone else to play the part.

260
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:40,711
He is Bhoothanathan, the
villain who kidnaps the child.

261
00:24:40,846 --> 00:24:44,714
That's fine for me.
l've played Judas before.

262
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:45,874
l'm happy playing the villain.

263
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:48,519
What about the heroine, Sarojini?

264
00:24:48,854 --> 00:24:52,688
Must find a good actress.

265
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:55,660
Won't Janet act?

266
00:24:56,194 --> 00:25:00,221
Act? Not me. People
will kill me in the end.

267
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:04,268
That's the problem. Here,
which girl would you get...

268
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:07,130
- to act in plays, let alone movies?

269
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:08,671
That's true.

270
00:25:09,307 --> 00:25:11,832
You won't get girls
from good families.

271
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:14,002
lt's loose women
who act, people say.

272
00:25:14,312 --> 00:25:18,772
Phalke even went to
brothels looking for women to act...

273
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:20,077
- in 'Raja Harischandra.'

274
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:21,751
But they chased him away.

275
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,245
Finally, a man did the female role.

276
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:29,216
We can't do that. We need
a woman to play Sarojini.

277
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:30,416
What will we do about that?

278
00:25:30,662 --> 00:25:33,062
Things have changed in Bombay.

279
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:36,793
When l visited Phalke's studio,
l saw a woman acting.

280
00:25:37,068 --> 00:25:40,003
What if we advertise
in the newspapers there?

281
00:25:41,673 --> 00:25:45,006
l met a Nathuram in Bombay.

282
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:48,370
He told me he arranges
actors and actresses.

283
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:50,037
l have his address.

284
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,477
l will write to him.

285
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:56,387
l must bring an
actress from somewhere.

286
00:25:56,955 --> 00:25:57,055
Ms Lana is a very good actress.

287
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:58,989
Ms Lana is a very good actress.

288
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:02,293
She has done three pictures in
Hindi,two pictures in Madras.

289
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:06,328
ln herfirst picture she did Draupadi,
afterthat Damayanti, Shakuntala...

290
00:26:06,431 --> 00:26:08,661
and in Dada Phalke's new
picture she plays Urmila.

291
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:09,891
Come, sir.

292
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:11,933
Mother.

293
00:26:13,204 --> 00:26:16,401
Her mother is Anglo-lndian,
father Parsi...he passed away.

294
00:26:20,946 --> 00:26:22,675
Hello.
- Hello.

295
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,213
Hadn't l told you before?
A film-maker from Malabar.

296
00:26:26,451 --> 00:26:27,315
Please come in.

297
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:29,682
Lana, darling, please come here.

298
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:30,749
Coming, Ma.

299
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:35,357
This is my daughter Lana.

300
00:26:35,493 --> 00:26:36,016
Hello.

301
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:38,952
This man is a film
producer from Travancore.

302
00:26:39,297 --> 00:26:41,197
He is on the lookout for a heroine...

303
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:43,926
...to act in the first film of
his state which he is making.

304
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:45,933
He wants you to act in it.

305
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:46,833
What is my role?

306
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:50,701
Sarojini, that's the
name of the character.

307
00:26:50,842 --> 00:26:52,707
ls she a princess or goddess?

308
00:26:53,044 --> 00:26:54,011
Princess...

309
00:26:54,145 --> 00:26:56,943
No, no, she's a Malayali Nair lady.

310
00:26:57,182 --> 00:26:58,615
What? Nair lady?

311
00:26:58,817 --> 00:27:01,411
Yes, an ordinary Nair lady.

312
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:04,647
Ordinary lady? l will act
as a princess or goddess.

313
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:09,225
This is not a mythological
story like Ramayana ,,,

314
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:10,089
- or Mahabharata.

315
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:11,659
This is a social drama.

316
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,693
What? Social drama?

317
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:16,261
l am sorry. l am not interested.

318
00:27:18,503 --> 00:27:22,371
l will explain to them.
Madam, please come inside.

319
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:33,715
{ Rockers }

320
00:27:34,252 --> 00:27:36,686
They are playing hard to get.
The Mother is a greedy person.

321
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:38,680
She will come if you pay well.

322
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:40,588
They have agreed.

323
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:44,553
But you have to pay them
100 British rupees per day.

324
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:48,129
100 British rupees?

325
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:52,201
lt's too much. l
really can't afford it.

326
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:53,962
Then she won't come.

327
00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:57,534
What shall l do? l
can't afford so much.

328
00:27:58,076 --> 00:28:00,567
Can we get some
other actress here?

329
00:28:00,912 --> 00:28:02,174
lt is very difficult, sir.

330
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:04,006
There are only three or
four like her in Bombay.

331
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:06,782
But they are all of a higher grade.

332
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:09,054
Ask if they will settle for 50 bucks.

333
00:28:09,054 --> 00:28:10,954
l will give 500 bucks
in advance for ten days.

334
00:28:12,824 --> 00:28:13,916
l will try.

335
00:28:14,492 --> 00:28:16,585
Nathuramji, one minute.
You too please come.

336
00:28:24,502 --> 00:28:25,560
They have agreed for 500.

337
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:28,204
But it will take eight days from
here to Thiruvanantapuram ..

338
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:28,964
- and back.

339
00:28:29,274 --> 00:28:30,571
They need extra money for that.

340
00:28:31,142 --> 00:28:33,633
Then to and fro first class
tickets for three persons.

341
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:34,844
First class?

342
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:37,545
Jesus! Won't it be a big amount?

343
00:28:37,782 --> 00:28:40,012
Ask them to travel third class.

344
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:43,780
The expense to buy first
class tickets is very high.

345
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:45,420
He can't afford it.

346
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:46,579
So we won't come.

347
00:28:47,525 --> 00:28:49,152
He is making a
picture forthe first time.

348
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:51,262
So what can we do?
We won't come.

349
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:55,057
They refuse to budge.
People like the royal family...

350
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:58,134
...and the East lndia Company
officials travel first class.

351
00:28:58,303 --> 00:29:00,066
Even Mahatma Gandhi
travels third class.

352
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:01,133
What did he say?

353
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:03,270
Even Gandhiji travels third class.

354
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:05,601
So what? He is not a film actor.

355
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:08,645
My daughter is an
actress, understand?

356
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:10,712
l will give you second class ticket.

357
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:13,010
No, if you want me
to act in your film...

358
00:29:13,118 --> 00:29:14,312
...you must get us
first class tickets.

359
00:29:14,652 --> 00:29:29,022
{ Rockers }

360
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:31,465
l doubted if you got my telegram.

361
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:32,365
Got it day before yesterday.

362
00:29:34,506 --> 00:29:35,996
Are they Hindi folks, or English?

363
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:38,142
They speak both. Ma'am, please...

364
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:41,405
Sorry, l am an actress. l
cannot travel by a horse cart.

365
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:43,311
What do you mean?

366
00:29:43,715 --> 00:29:46,513
ln Bombay we usually
travel in a motor car, you know?

367
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:49,112
Motor car?.
Yes, motor car.

368
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:52,282
But Ms Lana, l don't
have a motor car.

369
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:53,852
Then you arrange one.

370
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:57,420
Jesus Christ! Motor cars
are very rare in Travancore.

371
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:58,960
Then l am sorry. We are leaving.

372
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:01,760
Are you joking?

373
00:30:01,933 --> 00:30:03,161
l am notjoking, Mr Daniel.

374
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:05,928
lf you don't arrange for a motor car,
we will go back in the next train.

375
00:30:06,404 --> 00:30:08,463
You heard that?
- Yeah.

376
00:30:08,706 --> 00:30:10,970
The next train to
Bombay is only on Monday.

377
00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:12,734
They will have to stay at
the railway station till then.

378
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:14,740
lt's the height of arrogance.

379
00:30:15,046 --> 00:30:17,241
Paid through my nose to bring them.

380
00:30:17,515 --> 00:30:19,380
Three first class tickets in addition.

381
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:20,482
Now they are asking for a motor car.

382
00:30:20,618 --> 00:30:21,915
Where can we get a carfrom?

383
00:30:22,453 --> 00:30:24,819
l have seen it only at the
palace and with the Diwan.

384
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:27,317
There may be three or four others
in the whole of Thiruvananthapuram.

385
00:30:28,293 --> 00:30:31,023
You see, it is very
difficult to get a motor car here.

386
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:32,527
Please try to understand.

387
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,529
Sorry, Mr Daniel. Now
you are insulting me.

388
00:30:37,535 --> 00:30:40,470
lf this is your film-making,
you will suffer a lot.

389
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,970
What will we do? lt's
hard to get another actress.

390
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:46,839
Your uncle, Dr Mathaeus,
has a car, doesn't he?

391
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:49,947
But only Uncle travels in it.

392
00:30:50,114 --> 00:30:52,105
Don't know if he will
allow these lot to get in it.

393
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,284
lt is the veranda of a Nair house,
right Thankappan Anna?

394
00:30:58,456 --> 00:30:59,980
Why? Doesn't it look like that?

395
00:31:00,325 --> 00:31:03,158
l have done it exactly as Daniel
Sir instructed me before he left.

396
00:31:04,262 --> 00:31:05,729
Must finish it by evening.

397
00:31:05,897 --> 00:31:07,626
Shooting starts when
Daniel comes tomorrow.

398
00:31:13,671 --> 00:31:16,697
Didn't the telegram say that the
train will arrive this morning?

399
00:31:17,075 --> 00:31:19,600
Now it is past noon, yet
there is no sign of Daniel.

400
00:31:20,845 --> 00:31:23,211
This is the dresses l bought for
the heroine to wear in the movie.

401
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,206
You must take measurements and
stitch as soon as she comes.

402
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:28,917
Those who come from Bombay
won't have our rowka and mundu.

403
00:31:29,153 --> 00:31:33,385
Pachu Anna, did you buy lunch
for the cameraman and his crew?

404
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:37,085
Selvarajan took them to Velappa
Anna's tea-shop to buy them lunch.

405
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:50,097
What happened?
Was the train late?

406
00:31:50,475 --> 00:31:52,875
lt wasn't the train that
was late. Waited three hours...

407
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:56,105
at the railway station till
Sundaran brought the motor car.

408
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:56,838
What for?

409
00:31:57,382 --> 00:31:59,942
Our heroine is the
Maharani of Bombay!

410
00:32:02,453 --> 00:32:03,215
Hello.

411
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:07,518
Daniel, why do they
continue to sit in the car?.

412
00:32:07,792 --> 00:32:09,783
Theirface looks like they
have been stung by a hornet.

413
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:10,859
What happened?

414
00:32:12,563 --> 00:32:13,427
Please get down.

415
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:14,893
What's happening here?

416
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,934
This is my studio. You
will be staying here.

417
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:19,403
Here?

418
00:32:19,904 --> 00:32:22,532
Janet, have you arranged
the room upstairs forthem?

419
00:32:22,707 --> 00:32:25,574
Yes. Johnson has brought cot
and mattress for that room.

420
00:32:25,877 --> 00:32:28,675
Mr Daniel, very sorry,
we cannot stay here.

421
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,681
Why?
- She is an actress.

422
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:33,577
How can we stay in a studio?

423
00:32:33,818 --> 00:32:36,184
Tell them to go see the room.
lt has all the facilities.

424
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:37,685
You please come and see the room.

425
00:32:37,922 --> 00:32:39,389
No, we will not stay here.

426
00:32:39,524 --> 00:32:41,219
But what is wrong here?

427
00:32:41,392 --> 00:32:43,121
We saw a beautiful
palace on the way.

428
00:32:43,227 --> 00:32:44,319
We would like to stay there.

429
00:32:44,495 --> 00:32:45,052
What?

430
00:32:45,997 --> 00:32:46,929
The palace?

431
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:49,693
lt looks amazing.
Get us a room there.

432
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:51,363
That's the Kowdiar
Palace they are talking of.

433
00:32:51,502 --> 00:32:52,867
On the way they
asked me what it was.

434
00:32:53,204 --> 00:32:55,035
So that's the story.

435
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:58,836
The princess wants the
Maharaja's palace itself to sleep.

436
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:01,373
lt doesn't look it's
going to go smooth, Daniel

437
00:33:01,546 --> 00:33:04,606
Ms Lana, that is the
Maharaja's Palace.

438
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:06,011
We can't even go in there.

439
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:07,615
Find us some other palace.

440
00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:10,084
We have heard that there are
so many palaces in Travancore.

441
00:33:11,222 --> 00:33:13,884
ln Bombay, the mother and
daughter stays in a shabby building.

442
00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:16,026
And they come here and
want to stay in a palace.

443
00:33:16,227 --> 00:33:17,751
Johnson, what should we do?

444
00:33:18,796 --> 00:33:20,320
l am itching to give
them one on theirfaces.

445
00:33:20,565 --> 00:33:23,659
l also feel the same.

446
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,496
But if they go, where will
we get another actress from?

447
00:33:25,636 --> 00:33:27,331
Such impossible women!

448
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:30,531
Besides it doesn't seem like
she will be good as Sarojini.

449
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,404
Hey, Mr Daniel. What is this?

450
00:33:32,543 --> 00:33:33,737
We have been
waiting for a long time.

451
00:33:33,878 --> 00:33:36,244
They waited three hours
for the motor car to come...

452
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:38,941
when it would have
taken just half an hour...

453
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:40,778
..in a horse-carriage to reach here.

454
00:33:42,253 --> 00:33:44,016
This will become
a headache, Daniel.

455
00:33:44,455 --> 00:33:45,581
Send them off.

456
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:48,623
That will be the best thing, Daniel.

457
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:50,852
We will get a girl from
our native place itself.

458
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:52,324
Let me look for one.

459
00:33:55,733 --> 00:34:15,518
{ Rockers }

460
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:17,621
That is the Rosamma
l told you about.

461
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:23,557
Will Christians act
on the dalits' stage?

462
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:26,093
They are dalits who
converted to Christianity.

463
00:34:26,664 --> 00:34:30,623
This girl's father is the cook
of the white missionary priest...

464
00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:31,734
- of L M S Church.

465
00:34:32,036 --> 00:34:34,937
lt is Fr Xavier of that
church who told me about her...

466
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:37,564
- that the cook's daughter is
acting in a kakkarashi play.

467
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:38,868
Go and have a look.

468
00:34:51,789 --> 00:34:53,450
She looks smart, isn't she, Sundara?

469
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:55,151
She performs quite well.

470
00:34:58,863 --> 00:35:01,058
Our Sarojini is a
Nair character,isn't she?

471
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:02,427
Will this dalit girl be suitable?

472
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,827
Do we have to look at the
caste and creed of an actress?

473
00:35:05,169 --> 00:35:06,830
Once she is cast in a
role she must look like it.

474
00:35:07,305 --> 00:35:08,738
Johnson, please talk to them.

475
00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:27,723
ln the last two shows,

476
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:31,023
Rosamma forgot her
steps three, four times.

477
00:35:31,395 --> 00:35:32,726
But today...

478
00:35:32,897 --> 00:35:36,663
thank God, she was perfect
throughout, wasn't she, Paulose?

479
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:37,358
True.

480
00:35:37,835 --> 00:35:40,201
Didn't Asan tell me to pray
each time l get on the stage?

481
00:35:40,371 --> 00:35:46,367
Now, since our God is Jesus,
can l pray to the Dalit god?

482
00:35:46,544 --> 00:35:48,739
l make the sign of the
cross as l get on the stage.

483
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,574
So from fear of erring l err.

484
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:54,909
Today l boldly
prayed to the Dalit god...

485
00:35:55,019 --> 00:35:56,008
...and also made the
sign of the cross.

486
00:35:56,721 --> 00:35:58,586
All gods are the same, my child.

487
00:35:59,123 --> 00:36:01,591
What is important is
the strength of our mind.

488
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:15,635
{ Rockers }

489
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,840
Who obeys if l say 'Don't go for
acting,don't go for acting.'?

490
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:22,605
Shouldn't there be obedience?
Look at the time she gets up.

491
00:36:23,047 --> 00:36:25,914
Can't step out
because of the gossip.

492
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:28,712
And a fatherto dance to hertune!

493
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:32,455
Mala came to know why
you weren't going for work.

494
00:36:32,957 --> 00:36:35,255
lf this is how it is going to be,
it will affect our livelihood.

495
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:45,499
Paulose, you know this Johnson?

496
00:36:46,504 --> 00:36:47,766
He's in the drama field.

497
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:50,437
You must have seen him
when he came to act...

498
00:36:50,608 --> 00:36:51,768
- in your white sahib's church.

499
00:36:51,909 --> 00:36:55,970
He acts as St John the
Baptist,Judas and all.

500
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,679
ls that so? Please come.

501
00:36:58,082 --> 00:36:59,242
No cookery today?

502
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:00,941
No. The white
sahib's gone to Kochi.

503
00:37:01,118 --> 00:37:05,054
Him and his friend saw
the kakkarishi play yesterday.

504
00:37:05,256 --> 00:37:08,054
His friend is making a movie.

505
00:37:08,593 --> 00:37:11,756
They need a girl to act in that.

506
00:37:12,296 --> 00:37:15,527
They came to me to ask you
if you will let her do it.

507
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:17,063
My lord! Cilima?

508
00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:20,030
lt's something we have
neither heard or seen.

509
00:37:20,204 --> 00:37:21,637
We have no peace of
mind since she started ..

510
00:37:21,806 --> 00:37:22,534
- acting in kakkarishi plays.

511
00:37:22,873 --> 00:37:25,842
lt's Asan who made the girl
who used to go for work regularly...

512
00:37:25,943 --> 00:37:26,637
to sing and dance.

513
00:37:26,944 --> 00:37:30,209
Now if she acts in the cinema,
won't the people pourfire...

514
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:30,905
-...over our heads?

515
00:37:31,048 --> 00:37:33,915
Folks will only continue
to say what they say now.

516
00:37:34,118 --> 00:37:36,586
Acting in cinema is not like acting
in kakkarishi plays.

517
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:39,719
She will get fame and glory.
They will give plenty of money too.

518
00:37:39,857 --> 00:37:40,619
That's right.

519
00:37:41,492 --> 00:37:44,256
The Rosamma then won't
be like the Rosamma now.

520
00:37:44,495 --> 00:37:46,429
Rosamma is a lucky girl.

521
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:50,462
Paulose, you can live
honourably and wealthily.

522
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:53,069
Still, Asan, a girl among us, acting...

523
00:37:53,237 --> 00:37:54,966
What has Ayyankali said?

524
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:58,733
This earth is not just forthe Nairs
and the Nampoothiris.

525
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:00,910
lt's also our own.

526
00:38:01,245 --> 00:38:02,712
What does it mean?

527
00:38:03,147 --> 00:38:07,914
lt means that we also have
the right to live as we please.

528
00:38:08,552 --> 00:38:10,349
Let me ask her opinion.

529
00:38:11,255 --> 00:38:15,021
Rosamma, did you
hear what we said?

530
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:17,689
l did.

531
00:38:18,262 --> 00:38:21,060
What is in your mind?

532
00:38:21,899 --> 00:38:23,093
l don't know.

533
00:38:23,567 --> 00:38:25,262
Girl, do you want to go?

534
00:38:31,542 --> 00:38:33,305
Have you seen this cinema picture?

535
00:38:33,544 --> 00:38:35,910
l have seen the cinema-house.
There people see movies...

536
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:40,414
paying three chakras to sit in
the ground and seven to sit in chairs.

537
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:43,179
They play the stories of Gods

538
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:45,914
The white people's movies
are also sometimes shown.

539
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:48,124
Why don't we ask my father
and go see a movie?

540
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:50,725
Will they allow members of
our caste inside?

541
00:38:52,229 --> 00:38:53,856
But you are going to act in a movie.

542
00:38:54,031 --> 00:38:54,827
They might let you in.

543
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,794
How do they shoot these movies?

544
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,661
l pondered over it yesterday night.

545
00:39:02,606 --> 00:39:05,939
lt might be just like acting
in kakkarishi plays, won't it?

546
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:08,843
They say crowds gather to see
the people who act in movies.

547
00:39:09,213 --> 00:39:12,979
Would l also have to wait to see you
just as people wait...

548
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:15,118
...by the roadside...
to see the Maharani?

549
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:20,254
lt's your luck, Rosamma.Only you
have that chance from among us.

550
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:25,822
They are making a movie in this
Malayalam land for the first time.

551
00:39:26,731 --> 00:39:29,632
And this Rosamma is its actress.

552
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:34,565
lsn't it said that a cinema actress
has to be very good-looking...

553
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:37,930
Malu, am l that beautiful?

''Hard to say why...''

Here's where they shoot the movie.
Didn't l tell you about Daniel?

593
00:43:44,388 --> 00:43:47,516
He is the one who is making this movie
and spending all the money...

594
00:43:47,758 --> 00:43:51,057
which means he is the producer,
director and everything.

595
00:43:52,663 --> 00:43:54,290
You didn't get it, did you my child?

596
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:56,194
ln other words,
he is the overlord of this movie...

597
00:43:56,367 --> 00:43:59,632
The cinema was invented
by the white man.

598
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:00,527
Get down.

599
00:44:02,906 --> 00:44:05,238
Wait here. l will tell Daniel.

600
00:44:05,943 --> 00:44:17,320
{ Rockers }

601
00:44:18,022 --> 00:44:19,080
Pillai, what are you doing?

602
00:44:19,223 --> 00:44:21,691
l am trying to figure out
how l am going to hold my face...

603
00:44:21,859 --> 00:44:24,123
before the camera.lt's not the
accustomed performance.

604
00:44:24,461 --> 00:44:27,624
This is not kathakali, Pillai.
Just hold yourface straight.

605
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:28,730
Rosamma has come.

606
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:40,071
Come in.

607
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:50,718
Come.

608
00:44:50,921 --> 00:44:53,389
There is no cast divide
and untouchability in cinema.

609
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:59,060
Mr Daniel, the film is loaded.
We are ready.

610
00:44:59,296 --> 00:45:02,493
All right, Mr Lala.
This is our actress Rosamma.

611
00:45:02,666 --> 00:45:03,792
This is the cameraman.

612
00:45:04,068 --> 00:45:05,092
This is the camera.

613
00:45:05,269 --> 00:45:07,567
The movie is shot with this.
Did you understand?

614
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:09,738
You didn't understand anything,
Rosamma, did you?

615
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:13,109
Everyone here is like Rosamma,
isn't it, Pillai?

616
00:45:14,678 --> 00:45:15,372
How is she?

617
00:45:16,413 --> 00:45:19,678
A black girl?Will she be
suitable for your character?

618
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:21,578
Does she look like
an upper caste girl?

619
00:45:23,187 --> 00:45:25,781
Well, at least in cinema...

620
00:45:25,923 --> 00:45:28,118
...we should not be thinking
of caste and color.

621
00:45:28,358 --> 00:45:29,325
l will join you shortly, Mr Lala.

622
00:45:31,161 --> 00:45:31,889
Come.

623
00:45:33,831 --> 00:45:34,820
Rosamma, please sit down.

624
00:45:36,633 --> 00:45:38,624
Don't fear, do sit down.

625
00:45:39,937 --> 00:45:41,564
This is my wife, Janet.

626
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:42,766
Sit down.

627
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:44,734
Please sit down, Rosamma.

628
00:45:52,316 --> 00:45:55,581
Rosamma has acted as Parvathy
in the kakkarashi play, right?

629
00:45:55,853 --> 00:46:00,313
You don't act from start to end
in cinema, unlike in plays.

630
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:02,991
Certain parts will be taken
from time to time.

631
00:46:03,193 --> 00:46:05,423
You must act as l tell you.

632
00:46:06,463 --> 00:46:07,157
ls that so?

633
00:46:07,364 --> 00:46:09,423
Daniel, that's what
l can't understand,

634
00:46:09,533 --> 00:46:10,727
no matter how many
times you tell me.

635
00:46:11,135 --> 00:46:12,693
How will the expressions
come to my face...

636
00:46:12,836 --> 00:46:15,134
if l act without continuity,
disregarding beginning and end?

637
00:46:15,572 --> 00:46:19,064
Even if Pillai doesn't understand,
Rosamma does, right, Rosamma?

638
00:46:22,346 --> 00:46:24,507
One or two scenes each day,

639
00:46:24,915 --> 00:46:28,908
so, your portions
will be shot in 10 or 12 days.

640
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,450
You will be paid wages of Rs5 daily.

641
00:46:30,687 --> 00:46:34,851
lf you act well and Daniel likes it...
you will be given a hike.

642
00:46:36,493 --> 00:46:40,691
Rosamma, you are a Nair girl
in this story: Sarojini.

643
00:46:42,065 --> 00:46:43,555
Sarojini has a brother.

644
00:46:43,867 --> 00:46:46,267
They are children
when the movie begins.

645
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:49,906
A man named Bhoothanathan, ...
a plantation supervisor in Colombo...

646
00:46:50,073 --> 00:46:54,066
...happens to see her brother playing
in her courtyard one day.

647
00:46:54,344 --> 00:46:56,335
He must have been barely
five years old then.

648
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:59,208
The fiendish
Bhoothanathan kidnaps

649
00:46:59,349 --> 00:47:00,646
- the child and takes
him to Colombo.

650
00:47:01,018 --> 00:47:02,986
Our Johnson is playing Bhoothanathan.

651
00:47:06,256 --> 00:47:09,987
ln Colombo, Bhoothanathan puts
the child through severe hardship...

652
00:47:10,127 --> 00:47:11,890
forcing him to work
in the plantations.

653
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:13,622
Many years pass by.

654
00:47:14,464 --> 00:47:17,490
Sarojini is now a young woman.

655
00:47:17,768 --> 00:47:20,202
That's where your
part begin, Rosamma.

656
00:47:20,971 --> 00:47:25,067
A young man, Vishwamohan Thampi,
is courting Sarojini.

657
00:47:25,309 --> 00:47:26,503
That part is enacted by Pillai.

658
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:31,374
lt is then that
a person called Jayachandran...

659
00:47:31,448 --> 00:47:32,710
comes to live in the neighborhood.

660
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:35,817
Jayachandran and Sarojini see
each otherfrequently.

661
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:37,677
They fall in love.

662
00:47:37,821 --> 00:47:40,016
lt is Daniel
who will act as Jayachandran.

663
00:47:41,325 --> 00:47:41,791
True.

664
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:43,754
lt is then that
Jayachandran has to go...

665
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:46,022
- to England for professional matters

666
00:47:46,263 --> 00:47:47,958
He goes to England via Colombo...

667
00:47:48,165 --> 00:47:50,497
where he is looted
by Bhoothanathan and his gang.

668
00:47:50,634 --> 00:47:51,965
Unable to proceed,
and forced to stay in Colombo...

669
00:47:52,402 --> 00:47:54,768
he gets acquainted
with Chandrakumar...

670
00:47:54,938 --> 00:47:58,635
as he was looking for a job.

671
00:47:58,909 --> 00:48:00,604
Chandrakumar is a young man now.

672
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:04,070
One day, having escaped from
the hands of Bhoothanathan...

673
00:48:04,248 --> 00:48:06,409
- Chandrakumar and
Jayachandran return home.

674
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:08,575
Bhoothanathan comes
searching for them.

675
00:48:08,752 --> 00:48:11,585
They fight with each
other on the way.

676
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:15,752
Jayachandran reaches
Sarojini's neighborhood.

677
00:48:16,026 --> 00:48:18,017
Sarojini sees Chandrakumar.

678
00:48:18,295 --> 00:48:22,959
Accidentally, seeing the black mole
on Chandrakumar's back...

679
00:48:23,133 --> 00:48:26,625
Sarojini recognizes him
as her long-lost brother.

680
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:32,436
Jayachandran marries Sarojini.
Everyone lives happily ever after.

681
00:48:33,644 --> 00:48:35,271
Rosamma, did you like the story?

682
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:39,442
We will start taking
Rosamma's parts today itself.

683
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:42,517
First, you will have
to change your costume.

684
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:44,948
The mundu and rowka
you are wearing now is...

685
00:48:45,122 --> 00:48:46,282
...not appropriate for Sarojini.

686
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:47,320
l will give you the costumes.

687
00:48:49,493 --> 00:48:51,188
Here's the mundu
and jumper.Don't know

688
00:48:51,328 --> 00:48:52,317
- if the measurement is right.

689
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:55,125
Pachu Annan here, who is our tailor,
stitched them based on speculation.

690
00:48:55,465 --> 00:48:56,989
Do you know how to
wear it, Rosamma?

691
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,226
lsn't it in the style of
upper caste ladies?

692
00:48:58,402 --> 00:48:59,334
l have seen it.

693
00:48:59,503 --> 00:49:02,336
Wear it on your neck and ears.
These are my ornaments.

694
00:49:02,539 --> 00:49:05,940
How can you wear the
ornaments after l wearthem?

695
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:07,838
Aren't we of a lower caste?

696
00:49:08,245 --> 00:49:11,009
lt doesn't matter.
These are not worn by Rosamma,

697
00:49:11,214 --> 00:49:14,183
but by Sarojini,
who belongs to a rich Nair family.

698
00:49:14,651 --> 00:49:41,639
{ Rockers }

699
00:49:48,352 --> 00:49:51,549
Next change your hair style and add
a little bit of color on your face...

700
00:49:51,722 --> 00:49:52,654
and you will be Sarojini herself.

701
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:55,155
What do you say, BhaskarAnna?
- Sure.

702
00:49:55,726 --> 00:49:57,250
So hurry up.
- Sit here, child.

703
00:49:59,529 --> 00:50:00,860
Sit down, Rosamma.

704
00:50:01,732 --> 00:50:05,031
l will stand here.
Sit here, child.

705
00:50:06,303 --> 00:50:41,699
{ Rockers }

706
00:50:42,639 --> 00:50:45,199
Now, Rosamma
has become Sarojini.

707
00:50:48,512 --> 00:50:49,740
So, shall we start?

708
00:50:50,514 --> 00:50:53,881
This is Sarojini's house...
see, the front side...

709
00:50:54,151 --> 00:50:57,416
Rosamma should come now,
from inside, with a lit lamp...

710
00:50:57,554 --> 00:50:59,988
and keep it here in the veranda.

711
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:04,717
Then, Jayachandran,
that is myself, will come...

712
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:08,626
Rosamma should then look at me,
wondering who l could be?

713
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:10,560
Did you understand, Rosamma?

714
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:12,960
l have a doubt.

715
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:16,134
The lamp is usually lit in the evening.
Now, it's only noon.

716
00:51:16,673 --> 00:51:19,437
Night and day appears
the same in a movie Pillai.

717
00:51:19,643 --> 00:51:21,304
Cinema can be shot only in sunlight.

718
00:51:21,445 --> 00:51:22,605
Yea... yea

719
00:51:24,448 --> 00:51:26,416
So, shall we start, Mr Lala?
- Yes, please.

720
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:27,475
Come, Rosamma.

721
00:51:29,152 --> 00:51:30,619
Let us start.
Go and stand near the door.

722
00:51:30,821 --> 00:51:33,255
You have to come from there.

723
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:36,718
Selvarajan, give
that lamp to Rosamma.

724
00:51:49,973 --> 00:51:51,133
When l get on the
kakkarashi stage...

725
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:53,333
Asan would ask me
to pray to the Dalit God.

726
00:51:53,577 --> 00:51:55,568
But l always involuntarily make
the sign of the cross...

727
00:51:55,679 --> 00:51:56,737
...and pray to Christ.

728
00:51:57,013 --> 00:51:58,207
lsn't this a movie?

729
00:51:58,381 --> 00:52:01,009
And wasn't the movie first
invented by Christians?

730
00:52:01,251 --> 00:52:02,548
So isn't it enough
if l made the sign of the cross?

731
00:52:02,752 --> 00:52:06,779
Rosamma,
you pray whichever way you want.

732
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:09,455
What is the matter?

733
00:52:09,759 --> 00:52:11,454
She asked me permission to pray.

734
00:52:12,562 --> 00:52:14,223
Shall we start, Rosamma?

735
00:52:14,431 --> 00:52:16,922
When l say, 'Action,'
you should come from there.

736
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,760
When l say what? Action.

737
00:52:20,036 --> 00:52:21,867
Have you understood? Then move.

738
00:52:29,412 --> 00:52:30,470
Have you finished praying?

739
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:34,010
lf so, take the lamp
and stand nearthe door.

740
00:52:38,421 --> 00:52:39,115
Go.

741
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,194
Clap.

742
00:52:54,137 --> 00:52:55,434
What is that thing?

743
00:52:56,206 --> 00:52:57,867
Have you understood
everything else?

744
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:00,241
ln cinema, there are lots of things
that are hard to understand.

745
00:53:00,443 --> 00:53:01,273
Yea yea...

746
00:53:05,448 --> 00:53:06,312
Action.

747
00:53:12,756 --> 00:53:14,121
Come.
Action.

748
00:53:14,891 --> 00:53:37,077
{ Rockers }

749
00:53:37,814 --> 00:53:38,473
Cut.

750
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:40,679
How was it, Mr Lala?
- Fine.

751
00:53:42,352 --> 00:53:44,411
Rosamma, you acted well.

752
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:52,550
Where is Rosamma?

753
00:53:52,696 --> 00:53:53,720
Didn't you call herfor lunch?

754
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:55,625
Let me look for her.

755
00:54:01,104 --> 00:54:03,129
Bhaskara Anna,
where is Rosamma?

756
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:04,204
She is over there.

757
00:54:18,521 --> 00:54:19,488
Are you sitting here?

758
00:54:19,823 --> 00:54:20,881
Come inside and eat.

759
00:54:21,224 --> 00:54:22,885
l will sit here.

760
00:54:24,861 --> 00:54:26,954
Are you having just rice gruel?
There is rice inside.

761
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:28,822
Gruel is enough for me.

762
00:54:29,966 --> 00:55:04,156
{ Rockers }

763
00:55:04,768 --> 00:55:07,328
Rosamma, what are you doing?

764
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:10,606
Don't do that.
Your dress will get dirty.

765
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:11,599
Get up.

766
00:55:14,944 --> 00:55:18,903
You are not the old Rosamma.
You are the heroine of our movie.

767
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:26,919
Rosamma, from now on, till the
end of the movie, you are not

768
00:55:27,123 --> 00:55:29,489
Rosamma nor are you
of lower caste.

769
00:55:29,726 --> 00:55:31,751
You are a Nair girl.
Don't forget that.

770
00:55:34,097 --> 00:55:35,121
What do you say, Janet?

771
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:37,596
Rosamma is now one among us.

772
00:55:37,901 --> 00:55:39,664
lsn't it why we have
named her Rosamma now?

773
00:55:40,537 --> 00:55:43,335
What if we modify
Rosamma's name?

774
00:55:43,973 --> 00:55:46,669
Sunder Rajan's brother-in-law's
wife's name is Rosy, isn't it?

775
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:47,242
Right.

776
00:55:47,377 --> 00:55:50,141
So, why don't we turn
Rosamma into Rosy?

777
00:55:50,313 --> 00:55:53,680
lt is good to call
and good to hear:Rosy.

778
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:55,308
What do you say, Rosamma?

779
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:58,309
What is your opinion, Johnson?

780
00:55:58,521 --> 00:56:01,581
Very good, Rosamma has
become totally fashionable.

781
00:56:03,326 --> 00:56:04,418
So shall we start?

782
00:56:04,994 --> 00:56:07,428
As Sarojini stands
in front of her house,

783
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:09,188
Vishwamohan Thampi...
comes that way.

784
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:12,592
He is a person who
is trying to court her.

785
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:14,427
Sarojini doesn't like him.

786
00:56:14,671 --> 00:56:16,366
When Vishwamohan
comes behind you,

787
00:56:16,573 --> 00:56:17,938
Rosamma you should show anger.

788
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:19,201
lt is Rosy now, not Rosamma.

789
00:56:19,776 --> 00:56:21,073
Yeah, Rosy.

790
00:56:21,244 --> 00:56:23,508
Seeing this,
Jayachandran comes that way.

791
00:56:23,913 --> 00:56:25,403
Vishwamohan does not like...

792
00:56:25,515 --> 00:56:26,174
Jayachandran's arrival.

793
00:56:26,349 --> 00:56:28,579
A quarrel ensues
between the two.Understood?

794
00:56:29,252 --> 00:56:31,413
This is the scene that
we are going to take now.

795
00:56:31,821 --> 00:56:33,516
Our Pillai is Vishwamohan.

796
00:56:34,524 --> 00:56:35,183
Where is Pillai?

797
00:56:35,425 --> 00:56:38,451
He was standing somewhere
around here, clueless.

798
00:56:39,129 --> 00:56:41,029
What are you
doing there,Pillai, come.

799
00:56:41,197 --> 00:56:42,926
Pillai, are you ready to act?
- Yea

800
00:56:43,466 --> 00:56:44,956
Like l told you, Pillai,

801
00:56:45,268 --> 00:56:47,828
when you see Sarojini, you must smile at
her showing sringara rasa.

802
00:56:48,104 --> 00:56:50,004
Acting sringara to
women is a little tough.

803
00:56:50,206 --> 00:56:52,265
l am used to doing feminine
roles in kathakali.

804
00:56:52,509 --> 00:56:54,807
lf it is the sringara of
women it is a whole lot easier.

805
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:00,941
But here, it is not a female role.
Vishwamohan is a man, isn't he?

806
00:57:01,151 --> 00:57:02,345
Yea yea... l know

807
00:57:02,519 --> 00:57:04,009
So the sringara expression
of man has to come, isn't it?

808
00:57:05,021 --> 00:57:06,215
When should the sringara come?

809
00:57:06,556 --> 00:57:09,855
When the camera starts,
l will say action. Then.

810
00:57:10,026 --> 00:57:11,050
You will say that thing, won't you?

811
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:13,896
You should look at Sarojini,
smile...

812
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:15,155
...then move up to
her and talk to her.

813
00:57:15,331 --> 00:57:17,492
l should talk to her.
What should l talk to her?

814
00:57:18,501 --> 00:57:22,335
She looks very beautiful,you wish
to have a relationship with her...

815
00:57:22,539 --> 00:57:23,665
something like that...

816
00:57:24,374 --> 00:57:27,138
when we see a movie,
we won't hear any dialogues.

817
00:57:27,377 --> 00:57:28,469
lt is not like the drama.

818
00:57:28,711 --> 00:57:29,700
Cinema does not have sound.

819
00:57:29,913 --> 00:57:32,677
Yet we must act as
though we are talking.

820
00:57:33,249 --> 00:57:36,514
lt is said that, in America,
they have invented talking cinema.

821
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:38,084
But it has not reached our land.

822
00:57:38,421 --> 00:57:41,913
One doubt. lf we cannot hear
the dialogues why do we speak?

823
00:57:42,192 --> 00:57:44,456
lsn't it enough that
l show mudras as in kathakali?

824
00:57:44,694 --> 00:57:46,889
Pillai, have you come to
act or to play the kathakali?

825
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:49,690
l'll act, but when
we do unaccustomed

826
00:57:49,899 --> 00:57:51,025
...things, won't we have doubts?

827
00:57:51,801 --> 00:57:53,928
So, should l show love
after l reach there,

828
00:57:54,103 --> 00:57:55,570
or should l start from here?

829
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:58,273
After you reach there.
- Right.

830
00:58:07,450 --> 00:58:10,317
Rosy, your acting was good.
Everyone liked it.

831
00:58:10,553 --> 00:58:12,748
Sundaran is giving wages.
Go, get it.

832
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:28,933
Rosy, don't stand
at the back. Come.

833
00:58:29,606 --> 00:59:01,395
{ Rockers }

834
00:59:02,338 --> 00:59:04,397
See Mr Daniel, it is perfect.

835
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:15,815
{ Rockers }

836
00:59:16,419 --> 00:59:17,579
The girl looks good.

837
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:24,883
This girl came and
called me when l was in

838
00:59:25,028 --> 00:59:26,154
- the Chala market selling fish.

839
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:28,659
Said there was some 'cilima'
shooting taking place...

840
00:59:28,831 --> 00:59:29,354
...and asked me to come along.

841
00:59:29,632 --> 00:59:31,429
When l heard money
was being given,

842
00:59:31,601 --> 00:59:33,398
l came without bothering
about anything else.

843
00:59:33,636 --> 00:59:36,104
So? See now, how a fisherwoman
became a Nair woman!

844
00:59:36,172 --> 00:59:39,005
See how pretty you
look in your attire.

845
00:59:39,108 --> 00:59:40,905
Aren't you a fisherwoman yourself?.

846
00:59:41,144 --> 00:59:42,475
And see what you are wearing.

847
00:59:43,446 --> 00:59:44,777
My husband is dead.

848
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:47,383
But isn't your husband
out fishing in the sea?

849
00:59:47,650 --> 00:59:48,309
lf he comes to know about this,

850
00:59:48,451 --> 00:59:50,442
he will chop you to
pieces like he chops fish.

851
00:59:51,321 --> 00:59:54,620
ls this a job meant
for women like us?

852
00:59:55,391 --> 00:59:57,222
lsn't it loose women who do this?

853
00:59:57,627 --> 00:59:58,958
Have you come here after
getting the permission

854
00:59:59,128 --> 01:00:00,390
of your father and mother?.
- Yes.

855
01:00:00,663 --> 01:00:03,632
Are you acting as my daughter?.
- Yes.

856
01:00:04,233 --> 01:00:06,531
And you?
-As her friend.

857
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:08,464
Johnson, does that old hag

858
01:00:08,571 --> 01:00:11,267
- and that girl know anything?
They look odd.

859
01:00:11,474 --> 01:00:12,532
What can we do?

860
01:00:12,742 --> 01:00:15,210
Had to search the whole
land to get these two.

861
01:00:15,311 --> 01:00:16,539
lf they don't fit, change the story.

862
01:00:16,679 --> 01:00:17,839
Make Sarojini's mother a fisherwoman.

863
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:20,112
Rosy, come.

864
01:00:20,917 --> 01:00:22,043
You also come.

865
01:00:23,052 --> 01:00:24,610
Have you seen the veena before?

866
01:00:25,321 --> 01:00:28,222
Sarojini is playing the
veena in the veranda of the house.

867
01:00:28,491 --> 01:00:31,016
Your mother and friend is
sitting nearby listening to it.

868
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:32,591
Now Jayachandran comes.

869
01:00:32,829 --> 01:00:34,854
That is the scene
we are going to take now.

870
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:35,756
Come, Rosy.

871
01:00:37,433 --> 01:00:38,798
Don't spit there, old woman.

872
01:00:39,736 --> 01:00:42,136
You sit here.
You sit on the floor.

873
01:00:43,039 --> 01:00:45,633
Show Rosamma how to hold it

874
01:00:45,942 --> 01:00:52,506
{ Rockers }

875
01:00:52,715 --> 01:00:55,479
We had one lower
caste woman first,

876
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:57,119
now we have two more.

877
01:00:57,220 --> 01:00:59,085
Did you only get
these people to act in...

878
01:00:59,255 --> 01:00:59,983
...a story about upper caste people?

879
01:01:00,156 --> 01:01:03,614
Aren't l of the upper caste?
My blood is boiling.

880
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:04,417
Look here, Pillai...

881
01:01:04,694 --> 01:01:05,922
ln Cinema, we can also
change an upper

882
01:01:06,095 --> 01:01:07,221
caste person into a
lower caste person.

883
01:01:07,397 --> 01:01:08,591
Just like we can change
a lower caste person...

884
01:01:08,731 --> 01:01:09,959
...into an upper caste person

885
01:01:11,434 --> 01:01:12,492
Pillai, go and sit
in a corner. Ready?

886
01:01:15,071 --> 01:01:15,765
Action.

887
01:01:16,472 --> 01:01:17,336
Look in the other direction

888
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:19,403
Play the veena.

889
01:01:19,575 --> 01:01:31,544
{ Rockers }

890
01:01:31,721 --> 01:01:32,688
What is it, old woman

891
01:01:33,956 --> 01:01:35,218
Do l know how to play the veena?

892
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:38,092
Daniel Sir said it was
enough if l pretend to play it.

893
01:01:38,461 --> 01:01:40,190
Finally l managed to do something.

894
01:01:40,329 --> 01:01:43,492
How lucky you are!You can at
least act like a highborn lady.

895
01:01:44,067 --> 01:01:46,695
True. l was allowed to wear
the brocaded mundu and rowka...

896
01:01:46,969 --> 01:01:49,267
and the ornaments
of Daniel Sir's wife.

897
01:01:50,306 --> 01:01:53,537
Will we get a chance
to wear these in our lifetime?

898
01:01:53,943 --> 01:01:58,346
But Daniel sir utters some
strange thing now and then:

899
01:01:59,482 --> 01:02:00,278
'Acashin'.

900
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:02,950
Then we are supposed
to act all of a sudden.

901
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:04,186
That's the problem.

902
01:02:04,387 --> 01:02:05,820
When will it be screened?

903
01:02:05,955 --> 01:02:06,580
That l don't know.

904
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:10,057
After my portion is over,
the shooting will be in Colombo.

905
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:15,057
Afterthat, it will be shown in the cinema
near the Huzur Kachery.

906
01:02:15,331 --> 01:02:17,196
ls there the converted dalit inside?

907
01:02:19,669 --> 01:02:22,069
Seeing that your girl hadn't
come to cut grass in...

908
01:02:22,205 --> 01:02:24,537
Thampi boss' household,
we enquired.

909
01:02:24,907 --> 01:02:28,604
lt is then that we came to know
she is acting in a 'cinema'.

910
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:30,276
You have become arrogant
after conversion,

911
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:31,573
...having escaped
untouchability and caste.

912
01:02:31,814 --> 01:02:33,406
And what's more you
have set her loose...

913
01:02:33,549 --> 01:02:35,278
...to act in dramas and flirt about.

914
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:38,819
You are my tenant, Kolappan.
Don't forget that.

915
01:02:39,055 --> 01:02:41,717
My name is not Kolappan now.
l am Paulose now.

916
01:02:41,891 --> 01:02:44,826
Does this land belong
to the East lndia Company

917
01:02:44,961 --> 01:02:46,553
that the Christian may do
anything he likes? No!

918
01:02:46,963 --> 01:02:49,090
This land belongs to the Maharaja.

919
01:02:49,232 --> 01:02:52,292
Tell her that if she flirts about
in the name of drama and cinema...

920
01:02:52,401 --> 01:02:54,096
and come to work in my house,

921
01:02:54,303 --> 01:02:58,205
l will chop off her
hands and legs like grass.

922
01:02:58,674 --> 01:03:01,643
{ Rockers }

923
01:03:02,111 --> 01:03:03,271
Move the vehicle.

924
01:03:03,479 --> 01:03:11,888
{ Rockers }

925
01:03:11,888 --> 01:03:16,052
{ Rockers }

926
01:03:16,359 --> 01:03:18,259
The shooting at Sarada
Vilasom will be over...

927
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:20,326
...when Rosy's portions are over.

928
01:03:20,997 --> 01:03:22,624
Then l will have to go to Colombo.

929
01:03:23,266 --> 01:03:25,860
All the crew,
equipments, traveling on the ship...

930
01:03:26,035 --> 01:03:27,866
...l will need a lot of money.

931
01:03:28,037 --> 01:03:30,301
Do you have to go to Colombo?
Can't we shoot it here?

932
01:03:30,606 --> 01:03:33,939
lsn't the boy kidnapped
to Colombo in the story?

933
01:03:34,277 --> 01:03:35,301
So it has to be shot there.

934
01:03:36,412 --> 01:03:37,674
How do we come
up with the money?

935
01:03:38,881 --> 01:03:41,406
We will sell off our
palmgroves and homestead...

936
01:03:41,551 --> 01:03:43,041
- at Agastheeshwaram.

937
01:03:43,719 --> 01:03:47,553
Then, l have told some
rich folks in Thiruvananthapuram.

938
01:03:48,357 --> 01:03:50,951
lf the Travancore National
Pictures is made a limited company...

939
01:03:51,127 --> 01:03:54,290
l can ask them to take shares.

940
01:03:54,564 --> 01:03:56,691
How will we get
back what we invest?

941
01:03:56,899 --> 01:03:58,890
Folks will come to watch the film.

942
01:03:59,068 --> 01:04:00,535
Will so many people come?

943
01:04:00,770 --> 01:04:04,035
lt will be shown not just in Capitol,
but in the cinemas in Nagercoil...

944
01:04:04,173 --> 01:04:07,301
Alleppey, Thrissur and so on.

945
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:10,377
lt will also be shown in the cinemas
of Madras, Madurai and so forth.

946
01:04:12,448 --> 01:04:15,975
Janet, didn't Phalke
become rich making films?

947
01:04:16,252 --> 01:04:18,379
And Nataraja Muthaliyar in Madras?

948
01:04:18,821 --> 01:04:24,623
Wait and watch, it will be
this J. C Daniel here in Travancore.

949
01:04:25,761 --> 01:05:13,172
{ Rockers }

950
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:18,138
Jayachandran comes with
Chandrakumarto Sarojini's house.

951
01:05:18,714 --> 01:05:20,648
Sarojini meets Chandrakumar.

952
01:05:23,819 --> 01:05:28,051
She accidentally sees the black
mole on Chandrakumar's back...

953
01:05:28,391 --> 01:05:31,554
and realizes that he
is her long lost brother.

954
01:05:31,827 --> 01:05:45,002
{ Rockers }

955
01:05:45,274 --> 01:05:46,332

{ Rockers }

957
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:55,179
The shooting at Sarada
Vilasom is over.

958
01:05:56,118 --> 01:05:59,610

{ Rockers }

960
01:07:01,150 --> 01:07:05,484
Daniel has asked me to give
you three days' extra wages.

961
01:07:05,721 --> 01:07:06,210
Take.

962
01:07:11,894 --> 01:07:16,160
Rosy acted fabulously.
All of us liked it very much.

963
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:20,330
We will inform you when the
movie is screened at 'Capitol.'

964
01:07:20,636 --> 01:07:21,534
You must come.

965
01:07:26,308 --> 01:07:29,175
This is the mundu and jumper
that you wore in the movie.

966
01:07:29,478 --> 01:07:30,570
lt is yours now.

967

You may go now, Rosie.

968

01:09:08,077 --> 01:09:10,102
He produced some film a long
while back, and became a pauper.

981

Sold away all his ancestral property.

982
01:09:12,448 --> 01:09:14,473
He now lives somewhere in
Tamil Nadu.

983
01:09:15,050 --> 01:09:17,177
He comes to this shop whenever
he visits Thiruvananthapuram.

984
01:09:17,419 --> 01:09:19,717
When my father is here he
comes here and tells old stories.

985
01:09:19,922 --> 01:09:21,048
Which movie did he make?

986
01:09:21,257 --> 01:09:25,455
Some movie of yesteryears.
Some silent movie.

987
01:09:25,828 --> 01:09:26,852
What is his name?

988
01:09:27,096 --> 01:09:29,894

{ Rockers }

991
01:10:27,022 --> 01:10:29,786
What are you searching?

992
01:10:32,061 --> 01:10:33,688
Aren't you having lunch?

993
01:10:33,862 --> 01:10:34,658
You carry on...

994
01:10:35,130 --> 01:11:05,121
{ Rockers }

995
01:11:06,195 --> 01:11:07,423
l remember.

996
01:11:07,830 --> 01:11:11,129
This film was released at
the Capitol cinema of those days.

997
01:11:12,234 --> 01:11:14,964
lt was screened only
three or four times.

998
01:11:15,237 --> 01:11:19,799
l saw it one ortwo
days following the release.

999
01:11:20,042 --> 01:11:21,976
Aftertwo orthree reels...

1000
01:11:22,144 --> 01:11:24,612
...some landlords sprang
up from their seats...

1001
01:11:25,214 --> 01:11:27,409
...and started shouting and booing.

1002
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:29,508
They destroyed furniture...

1003
01:11:29,752 --> 01:11:31,379
...and hurled slippers
and stones on to the screen.

1004
01:11:31,553 --> 01:11:32,747
The projection had to be stopped.

1005
01:11:33,622 --> 01:11:37,991
l remember seeing the scared
Daniel in the projection room.

1006
01:11:38,861 --> 01:11:41,625
l have seen him
only on that occasion.

1007
01:11:41,830 --> 01:11:42,819
The screening of that
film ended that day in

1008
01:11:42,965 --> 01:11:43,556
- Thiruvananthapuram.

1009
01:11:43,766 --> 01:11:46,326
Vigathakumaran is the
first film in Malayalam.

1010
01:11:46,568 --> 01:11:49,560
The man who made it lives
somewhere in this land.

1011
01:11:49,972 --> 01:11:52,065
ls it right that
we don't know about it?

1012
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:55,277
How does it become
the first Malayalam movie?

1013
01:11:55,411 --> 01:11:57,743
lsn't T R Sundaram's Balan
the first Malayalam movie?

1014
01:11:57,880 --> 01:12:02,214
That was the first sound movie.
lt was released in1938.

1015
01:12:02,484 --> 01:12:05,578
J C Daniel made this
movie ten years before that.

1016
01:12:05,854 --> 01:12:08,687
How can a silent movie
be called a Malayalam movie?

1017
01:12:08,957 --> 01:12:10,288
lt has no language.

1018
01:12:10,559 --> 01:12:13,892
lf so, how can you call
Charlie Chaplin's film English.

1019
01:12:14,063 --> 01:12:15,257
lsn't that a silent movie too?

1020
01:12:17,733 --> 01:12:20,293
Before Balan there
was another film too:

1021
01:12:20,469 --> 01:12:21,834
C V Raman Pillai's Marthandavarma.

1022
01:12:21,970 --> 01:12:23,995
lt was produced by
one Sunder Rajan of Chala.

1023
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:25,435
He too has become a pauper.

1024
01:12:25,641 --> 01:12:26,573
Boss, shot is ready.

1025
01:12:28,444 --> 01:12:29,411
Please go, Chelangadan.

1026
01:12:29,611 --> 01:12:31,203
Which movie is this?
- Kattumallika

1027
01:12:34,116 --> 01:12:36,710
Do you know where this
Daniel is at present?

1028
01:12:36,952 --> 01:12:38,112
No.

1029
01:12:38,620 --> 01:12:40,986
Ready. We can see once.

1030
01:12:42,458 --> 01:13:13,052

1031

Aghastheeswaram.
Come, get down.

1032
01:13:25,667 --> 01:13:26,429
Get in.

1033

Do you know where
J C Daniel lives?

1034
01:13:36,912 --> 01:13:38,675
He made a film long ago.

1035
01:13:38,914 --> 01:13:40,074
Don't know.

1036
01:13:43,185 --> 01:13:46,552
Do you know a J C Daniel?

1037
01:13:46,688 --> 01:13:49,987
Yea, he is the dentist.

1038
01:13:52,594 --> 01:13:55,654
We don't know that he made a film.

1039
01:13:56,098 --> 01:13:59,192
lt has been thirty years
since he first came here.

1040
01:13:59,535 --> 01:14:03,767
He was a good dentist.
Not now, but a long time back.

1041
01:14:04,006 --> 01:14:07,203
See. He took all my teeth.

1042
01:14:10,612 --> 01:14:11,579
Where is his house?

1043
01:14:12,047 --> 01:14:15,414
Go straight from
here for about a mile.

1044
01:14:15,751 --> 01:14:18,811
There is a Christian church nearby.
His house is in the next street.

1045
01:14:19,755 --> 01:14:40,735
{ Rockers }

1046
01:14:41,643 --> 01:14:44,612

Who are you?

1049

Daniel sir?

1050
01:14:56,492 --> 01:14:58,585
ls there nobody in the house?
lt is locked.

1051
01:14:58,827 --> 01:14:59,953
He is inside.

1052
01:15:00,662 --> 01:15:02,721
Daniel sir.

1053
01:15:03,098 --> 01:15:05,328
He is recuperating
after an eye operation.

1054
01:15:06,001 --> 01:15:07,366
Daniel sir...

1055
01:15:07,736 --> 01:15:08,498
Who?

1056
01:15:09,771 --> 01:15:11,295
This is me, Chellakannu.

1057
01:15:11,874 --> 01:15:12,932
The door is locked from the outside.

1058
01:15:13,108 --> 01:15:14,700
There is somebody here to see you.

1059
01:15:15,077 --> 01:15:16,169
Ask who it is.

1060
01:15:17,513 --> 01:15:21,540
Daniel Sir,
l am Chelangad Gopala Krishnan.

1061
01:15:21,817 --> 01:15:24,479
l am coming from Cherthala.

1062
01:15:25,587 --> 01:15:26,679
What do you want?

1063
01:15:28,090 --> 01:15:29,921
l want to see you.

1064
01:15:30,959 --> 01:15:34,053
l am bedridden following
an eye operation.

1065
01:15:34,763 --> 01:15:39,166
She has gone to Nagercoil
to get me medicines.

1066
01:15:40,168 --> 01:15:42,762
l can't see because of my ailment.

1067
01:15:43,539 --> 01:15:46,633
That is why she locked the door.

1068
01:15:47,442 --> 01:15:48,431
What do you want?

1069
01:15:49,578 --> 01:15:51,671
l will wait. Let your wife come.

1070
01:15:53,949 --> 01:15:57,578
She has to go for everything.
lt will be dusk when she returns.

1071
01:15:57,753 --> 01:15:58,515
Never mind. l will wait.

1072
01:15:59,121 --> 01:16:01,851
He was in such an esteemed position.
Now everything has gone.

1073
01:16:02,124 --> 01:16:04,024
This is his brother's house.

1074
01:16:04,226 --> 01:16:06,057
Their family is in Madras.

1075
01:16:06,728 --> 01:16:07,922
They have given half of this house...

1076
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:09,894
...for Daniel sir
and his wife to stay.

1077
01:16:10,933 --> 01:16:11,957
His children?

1078
01:16:12,267 --> 01:16:16,101
Two boys, three girls.
One is in abroad, another in Salem...

1079
01:16:16,271 --> 01:16:19,365
then Madurai,Thiruvananthapuram...
all live in different places.

1080
01:16:19,741 --> 01:16:22,209
No one comes here to visit them.

1081
01:16:22,444 --> 01:16:25,379
The youngest boy sometimes
sends him money orders from Salem.

1082
01:16:25,514 --> 01:16:28,415
That is how they manage to live on.

1083
01:16:28,650 --> 01:16:30,618
You didn't say who you are?

1084
01:16:31,286 --> 01:16:35,814
l am a journalist.
l write about film personalities.

1085
01:16:36,391 --> 01:16:38,985
l am not a film personality.

1086
01:16:40,028 --> 01:16:48,595
You were, long time ago, weren't you?
l have come to talk about it.

1087
01:16:49,338 --> 01:16:51,272
l do not remember anything.
lt happened long time ago.

1088
01:16:51,807 --> 01:16:55,243
What good is it to
rememberthat now?

1089
01:16:57,980 --> 01:17:01,211
3rd May 1966.

1090
01:17:01,950 --> 01:17:04,612
l saw J C Daniel today.

1091
01:17:05,053 --> 01:17:09,581
After a long day's
wait in a dark room...

1092
01:17:09,791 --> 01:17:13,522
in an old dilapidated house
in Agastheeshwaram in Tamil Nadu.

1093
01:17:14,096 --> 01:17:21,332
The pioneer of Malayalam cinema
lay paralyzed with sightless eyes.

1094
01:17:29,144 --> 01:17:34,309
Daniel, Daniel... Are you sleeping?

1095
01:17:35,350 --> 01:17:36,578
Have you come?

1096
01:17:37,019 --> 01:17:38,486
A man has come to see you.

1097
01:17:38,854 --> 01:17:41,152
He has been waiting
outside a long time.

1098
01:17:41,323 --> 01:17:47,751
Didn't l say
l don't want to see anyone...

1099
01:17:48,764 --> 01:17:51,255
...and no one need see me?

1100
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:54,528
Daniel did not relent
to seeing me at first.

1101
01:17:54,803 --> 01:17:57,033
lt was as though
he had no interest...

1102
01:17:57,205 --> 01:18:00,402
to reminisce about the past,
and his memories.

1103
01:18:00,642 --> 01:18:04,510
No one had come looking
for me all this while.

1104
01:18:05,247 --> 01:18:06,908
Why, now?

1105
01:18:07,349 --> 01:18:09,817
Shouldn't the world know
that such a person is living here?

1106
01:18:10,352 --> 01:18:16,257
No. Who is J. C Daniel
forthe world to know about?

1107
01:18:17,959 --> 01:18:22,953
Janet, give him tea
and ask him to leave.

1108
01:18:37,079 --> 01:18:38,842
He is like this nowadays.

1109
01:18:38,980 --> 01:18:41,915
He is angry with everything,
and everyone

1110
01:18:43,118 --> 01:18:45,712
Please leave now and
come back some othertime.

1111
01:18:52,427 --> 01:18:56,158
Weren't you with him,
when he made the movie madam?

1112
01:18:56,465 --> 01:18:58,695
Can you tell me some of
the things that you remember?

1113
01:19:01,636 --> 01:19:03,627
Wasn't the picture completed then?

1114
01:19:03,939 --> 01:19:05,600
And it was screened
at Capitol cinema hall too.

1115
01:19:05,907 --> 01:19:08,205
What, then happened
to Vigathakumaran?

1116
01:19:09,878 --> 01:19:12,870
Even though she was reluctant
first,she talked to me later.

1117
01:19:14,349 --> 01:19:17,216
Even though
shooting started in 1928,

1118
01:19:17,853 --> 01:19:21,220
it was only on 23 October 1930...

1119
01:19:21,456 --> 01:19:25,756
after two years, that Vigathakumaran

1120
01:19:25,927 --> 01:19:27,292
- was screened at Capitol cinema.

1121
01:19:32,834 --> 01:19:35,564
Advocate Mulloor will come
to inaugurate the first show.

1122
01:19:35,737 --> 01:19:37,830
Then invitations have
been sent out to the Palace...

1123
01:19:37,939 --> 01:19:39,236
...and to other dignitaries here.

1124
01:19:39,374 --> 01:19:42,002
We must advertise in newspapers.
Only then will people know.

1125
01:19:42,144 --> 01:19:44,476
Yes. Notices are also being printed.

1126
01:19:44,813 --> 01:19:45,973
Ponnappan will do the announcements.

1127
01:19:46,348 --> 01:19:50,842
You should announce
even in small by-lanes.

1128
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:52,211
Only then will we get a crowd.

1129
01:19:52,420 --> 01:19:55,287
You don't have to tell me that.
That is my job.

1130
01:19:55,490 --> 01:19:58,220
Daniel, we got the
notice printed.

1131
01:20:01,396 --> 01:20:02,658

Do dignitaries have

Put all those chairs in front.

1164

All right.

Hey, what is this? lnauspicious!

1171
01:22:43,692 --> 01:22:46,252
Do we see the cinema-show
seated with such untouchables?

1172
01:22:46,428 --> 01:22:47,827
Stand aside!

1173
01:22:48,196 --> 01:22:50,994
Can we consider such
things in the cinema-hall?

1174
01:22:51,166 --> 01:22:53,657
Be it the cinema-hall
or any other goddamned place...

1175
01:22:53,902 --> 01:22:54,800
the upper caste is upper caste...

1176
01:22:54,936 --> 01:22:56,130
...and the lower caste
remains lower caste.

1177
01:22:56,338 --> 01:22:57,236
Do you doubt it?

1178
01:23:00,809 --> 01:23:02,106
Mulloor, let us go.

1179
01:23:02,243 --> 01:23:03,710
Let him show it to the dalits
and all the lower caste.

1180
01:23:03,845 --> 01:23:05,472
lt is bad to insult us
this way after inviting us.

1181
01:23:05,613 --> 01:23:08,104
Sir, please don't go.lt is you
who has to inaugurate the show.

1182

dividend untouchability.

1184

01:25:05,967 --> 01:25:07,730
This is not a story from
the Mahabharata, ...

1201
01:25:07,902 --> 01:25:09,335
northe Ramayana...

1202
01:25:09,471 --> 01:25:10,699
This is a social story.

1203
01:25:11,306 --> 01:25:13,171
Those who have acted
in this story are...

1204
01:25:13,241 --> 01:25:14,572
J C Daniel

1205
01:25:14,776 --> 01:25:16,209
Mullakkal Johnson,

1206
01:25:16,411 --> 01:25:18,402
child artist Sundaram Daniel.

1207
01:25:18,713 --> 01:25:21,773
Damodaran Pillai and P K Rosy.

1208
01:25:22,817 --> 01:26:15,632
{ Rockers }

1209
01:26:16,771 --> 01:26:18,705
You have seen the child,
Chandrakumar,

1210
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:21,308
kidnapped by Bhoodhanathan,
has grown up.

1211
01:26:23,845 --> 01:26:25,813
Moorthy Anna, how are things?

1212
01:26:30,718 --> 01:26:34,711
Now the heroine of
the movie is entering...

1213
01:26:40,195 --> 01:26:42,720
Now the hero of the story,
Jayachandran enters...

1214
01:26:47,168 --> 01:26:48,533
Now you are seeing
the scene in which...

1215
01:26:48,703 --> 01:26:50,500
...Jayachandran introduces himself...

1216
01:26:50,605 --> 01:26:51,629
to his neighbors.

1217
01:26:53,608 --> 01:26:56,634
Jayachandran falls in love
with the beautiful Sarojini...

1218
01:26:59,881 --> 01:27:01,678
Stop! Stop!
This show must not continue.

1219
01:27:01,816 --> 01:27:02,874
lt's not enough that
a dalit girl has acted...

1220
01:27:03,017 --> 01:27:03,984
...but she has acted as a Nair girl.

1221
01:27:06,020 --> 01:27:06,850
What is this?

1222
01:27:07,155 --> 01:27:09,089
We will not allow this.
Stop. l say stop.

1223
01:27:09,324 --> 01:27:10,586
Enough... enough.
Stop it.

1224
01:27:17,065 --> 01:27:18,532
Stop this filthy show.

1225
01:27:18,666 --> 01:27:19,690
Let's go.

1226
01:27:36,217 --> 01:27:37,377
There's the whore!

1227
01:27:39,654 --> 01:27:41,349
This vile girl insulted
us all by acting in this movie.

1228
01:27:41,522 --> 01:27:42,887
What should we do Mallur?

1229
01:27:43,124 --> 01:27:44,421
Don't let her go.

1230
01:27:45,159 --> 01:28:08,540
{ Rockers }

1231
01:28:09,050 --> 01:28:12,850
Thus the first show of
Daniel's movie was spoiled.

1232
01:28:13,855 --> 01:28:15,652
Malayalam's first movie...

1233
01:28:15,923 --> 01:28:20,121
became a victim of bad customs
and the caste system.

1234
01:28:20,528 --> 01:28:24,464
They branded Malayalam's
first heroine as a whore...

1235
01:28:24,766 --> 01:28:27,234
...and chased her
off from the cinema.

1236
01:28:27,935 --> 01:28:30,301
Rosy fled for her life that night...

1237
01:28:30,471 --> 01:28:33,133
not having the good
fortune to ever see...

1238
01:28:33,374 --> 01:28:36,639
...her face on the silver screen.

1239
01:28:37,679 --> 01:28:42,878
Rosy became the tragic
heroine of Malayalam Cinema.

1240
01:28:45,987 --> 01:28:51,015
The landlord Thambi and other
caste-blind lords and dignitaries...

1241
01:28:51,259 --> 01:28:53,853
...hunted Rosy continually...

1242
01:28:54,062 --> 01:28:57,122
...isolating herself
and family from social life.

1243
01:28:57,832 --> 01:29:36,835
{ Rockers }

1244
01:29:37,605 --> 01:29:41,006
Having somehow escaped
from the attack of the landlords...

1245
01:29:41,142 --> 01:29:42,905
Rosy fled under
cover of darkness...

1246
01:29:43,010 --> 01:29:45,570
Rosy fled under
cover of darkness...

1247
01:29:45,947 --> 01:29:49,610
What happened to her since,
is unknown.

1248
01:30:00,628 --> 01:30:03,153
Yet anotherjourney
to Agastheeshwaram...

1249
01:30:05,533 --> 01:30:09,333
This journey became necessary
because J C Daniel wrote a letter...

1250
01:30:09,504 --> 01:30:10,994
expressing his desire
to see me personally.

1251
01:30:20,081 --> 01:30:20,740
Come.

1252
01:30:21,115 --> 01:30:22,173
Daniel is inside.

1253
01:30:22,517 --> 01:30:45,898
{ Rockers }

1254
01:30:46,174 --> 01:30:51,111
When you came that day,
l felt like talking to you that way...

1255
01:30:53,047 --> 01:30:56,312
l feel a sense of aversion
towards everything...

1256
01:30:56,851 --> 01:30:58,182
How are your eyes?

1257
01:30:58,953 --> 01:31:03,583
Can see vaguely.
Still there is a blur.

1258
01:31:04,125 --> 01:31:04,887
Do sit down.

1259
01:31:07,228 --> 01:31:11,130
She read out to me the
article in the magazine you sent...

1260
01:31:12,133 --> 01:31:15,830
When l realized that there was
somebody to remind me of...

1261
01:31:16,003 --> 01:31:17,493
those days...

1262
01:31:17,638 --> 01:31:20,266
and come looking for me,l felt
bad about the way l treated you.

1263
01:31:20,541 --> 01:31:23,101
That's why l wrote
asking to see you.

1264
01:31:23,344 --> 01:31:25,369
l would have come regardless.

1265
01:31:26,047 --> 01:31:30,006
Madam told me only up to
the point where the first screening...

1266
01:31:30,218 --> 01:31:31,185
of Vigathakumaran was marred.

1267
01:31:31,419 --> 01:31:34,115
l need to know the
rest of your story as well

1268
01:31:36,657 --> 01:31:39,524
We read about Sathyan
in that magazine.

1269
01:31:39,961 --> 01:31:41,553
He also belongs to our community...

1270
01:31:41,796 --> 01:31:42,455
Nadar.

1271
01:31:42,864 --> 01:31:46,732
l have met him once or twice,
before he came into movie,

1272
01:31:46,868 --> 01:31:48,062
when he was in
the police department.

1273
01:31:48,302 --> 01:31:51,430
He had asked me about
Vigathakumaran then.

1274
01:31:52,373 --> 01:31:53,897
When 'Neelakkuyil' was playing...

1275
01:31:54,075 --> 01:31:55,804
l told Daniel that

1276
01:31:56,077 --> 01:31:58,671
we should go see it
in Thiruvananthapuram.

1277
01:31:59,180 --> 01:32:00,169
He did not agree.

1278
01:32:00,848 --> 01:32:03,214
There are many
movies playing now,isn't it?

1279
01:32:03,484 --> 01:32:07,250
Yes, Chemmeen has been
running for more than 100 days...

1280
01:32:07,421 --> 01:32:09,013
and it has been winning awards.

1281
01:32:10,558 --> 01:32:12,355
l have heard my children
speak about Sheela,

1282
01:32:12,527 --> 01:32:13,824
who acted as the heroine in it.

1283
01:32:14,495 --> 01:32:15,928
The old days are over now.

1284
01:32:16,564 --> 01:32:18,759
Now irrespective of whether
one is Nair or a Christian...

1285
01:32:18,933 --> 01:32:21,060
there are a lot of
actresses in cinema.

1286
01:32:22,336 --> 01:32:26,830
Do you know where the heroine
of your movie, Rosy is now?

1287
01:32:29,777 --> 01:32:32,974
Caste fanatics chased
the poor girl off.

1288
01:32:34,015 --> 01:32:38,008
She did not even have the luck
to see herself act on the screen.

1289
01:32:39,854 --> 01:32:43,017
l heard a rumor that as
she fled from the landlords...

1290
01:32:43,391 --> 01:32:47,293
she fell in front of a
goods truck heading to Nagercoil...

1291
01:32:47,528 --> 01:32:52,727
...and was saved by the driver,
a certain Kesava Pillai.

1292
01:32:53,234 --> 01:32:56,101
Johnson told me
that she married him...

1293
01:32:56,237 --> 01:33:01,903
...and lives there under
the name of Rajammal.

1294
01:33:04,111 --> 01:33:06,204
That was many years back.

1295
01:33:06,447 --> 01:33:11,976
Now it is not known
if she is dead or alive...

1296
01:33:13,754 --> 01:33:16,348
What happened to
Vigathakumaran after that?

1297
01:33:17,491 --> 01:33:19,959
Why didn't you make
a film after that?

1298
01:33:24,765 --> 01:33:28,724
Janet, give him something to drink.
- Not now, please.

1299
01:33:28,869 --> 01:33:32,635
Then let us walk to thejunction.

1300
01:33:36,010 --> 01:33:38,570
So, the show at
Capitol was stopped.

1301
01:33:41,048 --> 01:33:42,640
Then it was screened...

1302
01:33:42,817 --> 01:33:44,808
for one ortwo days each

1303
01:33:44,986 --> 01:33:46,578
at Kattookkaran's
cinema in Thrissur...

1304
01:33:46,754 --> 01:33:48,881
then Alleppey and Thalashery.

1305
01:33:50,057 --> 01:33:52,355
Not many people came.

1306
01:33:53,127 --> 01:33:56,324
There were also problems there...

1307
01:33:57,498 --> 01:34:00,126
the same kind of problems
as in Thiruvananthapuram.

1308
01:34:01,168 --> 01:34:03,261
The film had to be canned.

1309
01:34:04,605 --> 01:34:13,809
The studio had to be closed
because of financial problems.

1310
01:34:14,048 --> 01:34:19,384
Sold the house at
Agastheeshwaram and came here.

1311
01:34:25,159 --> 01:34:43,135
{ Rockers }

1312
01:34:43,511 --> 01:34:54,752
''O wind, O wind, have you come
to the non-blooming tree with ahum?

1313
01:34:55,122 --> 01:35:06,158
'' Have the sweet plantains
been filled with nectar?''

1314
01:35:06,467 --> 01:35:13,532
''Has the non-visible
tree borne flower and fruit?''

1315
01:35:13,974 --> 01:35:17,535
'' Has the sweltering
Meenam heat been...

1316
01:35:17,712 --> 01:35:24,049
- breezed by your cooling feathers?''

1317
01:35:26,187 --> 01:35:30,317
lsolated from Mother and siblings,
Janet and l began a new life...

1318
01:35:30,491 --> 01:35:35,087
in that small house
at Agastheshwaram...

1319
01:35:36,931 --> 01:35:44,337
'' Yesterday it faded away,
today a dream came with me...''

1320
01:35:44,538 --> 01:35:47,996
'' From burnt and
charred branches...''

1321
01:35:48,242 --> 01:35:51,871
'' ...red tender shoots
have raised their heads...''

1322
01:35:52,146 --> 01:35:58,915
'' Waving your infant-tender hands,
run to me, golden dawn...''

1323
01:35:59,220 --> 01:36:06,592
'' Rock the pearly floral
cradle to pet and fondle...''

1324
01:36:06,994 --> 01:36:10,623
'' Can you voice honeyed
words in my ear?''

1325
01:36:10,765 --> 01:36:14,166
'' O wind, O wind...''

1326
01:36:14,335 --> 01:36:21,400
' O wind, O wind, have you come
to the non-blooming tree with ahum?

1327
01:36:21,542 --> 01:36:32,350
'' Have the sweet plantains
been filled with nectar?''

1329

'' The storm-clouds
in the sky has gone...''

1330

'' ...the silver moonbeam
chariots have come.''

1331
01:36:56,477 --> 01:37:03,645
'' The rice-fields are in full bloom,
the sad night storm has passed...''

1332
01:37:03,818 --> 01:37:11,054
'' Little flowers,
like buds, await the eye to bloom...''

1333
01:37:13,327 --> 01:37:16,524
Meanwhile,
l had the desire to learn dentistry.

1334
01:37:18,032 --> 01:37:21,024
Went to Madras to learn dentistry...

1335
01:37:24,104 --> 01:37:26,095
Became a dental surgeon...

1336
01:37:27,007 --> 01:37:31,910
Ran dental clinics
in Pudukotai and Madurai...

1337
01:37:33,447 --> 01:37:35,381
Life improved once again...

1338
01:37:35,749 --> 01:37:38,616
Janet gave birth
to two more children.

1339
01:37:39,220 --> 01:37:45,648
So happy times with
Janet and five children...

1340
01:37:46,360 --> 01:38:18,149
{ Rockers }

1341
01:38:19,026 --> 01:38:20,152
Johnson!

1342
01:38:20,561 --> 01:38:21,721
One minute...

1343
01:38:25,266 --> 01:38:26,528
l had received news about you.

1344
01:38:26,934 --> 01:38:28,663
Been meaning to come
see you for a long time.

1345
01:38:28,869 --> 01:38:31,064
Daniel, you could have
written to me once in a while.

1346
01:38:32,139 --> 01:38:34,004
l was running away from everything.

1347
01:38:34,441 --> 01:38:36,432
l forgot you too amidst all that...

1348
01:38:36,677 --> 01:38:39,145
Doesn't matter. You are doing fine.

1349
01:38:41,315 --> 01:38:44,716
At least you have a 'Dr'
in front of you like your father:

1350
01:38:44,885 --> 01:38:46,182
DrJ C Daniel.

1351
01:38:48,289 --> 01:38:49,381
Come. Sit.

1352
01:38:50,157 --> 01:38:51,681
The patients...
- lt doesn't matter.

1353
01:38:51,992 --> 01:38:54,688
What are you doing now?

1354
01:38:54,962 --> 01:38:56,361
Stopped acting in dramas long ago.

1355
01:38:56,597 --> 01:38:58,997
l am into coconut business now.
Going on.

1356
01:38:59,500 --> 01:39:01,661
Did you hear about Sunder Rajan?

1357
01:39:03,904 --> 01:39:06,634
Heard that he made a movie...

1358
01:39:06,840 --> 01:39:10,674
Yea. When you left cinema,
he became obsessed with it.

1359
01:39:11,011 --> 01:39:15,607
He made C. V. Raman Pillai's novel,
Marthanda Varma into a movie.

1360
01:39:15,749 --> 01:39:17,808
He sold his ancestral property,
just like you.

1361
01:39:18,118 --> 01:39:21,212
Heard he also got some
help from the Palace.

1362
01:39:21,956 --> 01:39:25,414
The director was a certain P V Rao,
from Madras...

1363
01:39:25,592 --> 01:39:28,891
On the day of release,
the publishers sued Sundera Rajan...

1364
01:39:29,096 --> 01:39:37,765
for copyright violation.
Mulloor was their advocate.

1365
01:39:37,938 --> 01:39:39,599
The court confiscated the film.

1366
01:39:41,709 --> 01:39:43,404
Afterthat Sundera Rajan's
condition became worse...

1367
01:39:43,544 --> 01:39:44,909
...than that of you, Daniel.

1368
01:39:45,045 --> 01:39:48,173
He is struggling
with all his debts now.

1369
01:39:54,254 --> 01:39:55,482
Janet, how are you?

1370
01:39:55,622 --> 01:39:58,090
Fine. How are Mariamma and kids?

1371
01:39:58,225 --> 01:39:58,782
They are OK.

1372
01:39:58,993 --> 01:40:01,018
Where are the elder ones?

1373
01:40:01,495 --> 01:40:03,622
Went to school. He is
the youngest:Harris.

1374
01:40:04,598 --> 01:40:05,565
l will bring coffee.

1375
01:40:07,234 --> 01:40:09,225
A sound movie has
released in Malayalam.

1376
01:40:09,470 --> 01:40:11,335
lt is called Balan.

1377
01:40:11,705 --> 01:40:48,307
{ Rockers }

1378
01:40:49,076 --> 01:40:50,304
Vanakkam, Doctor Sir.

1379
01:40:52,446 --> 01:40:54,311
Do you know who that is?

1380
01:40:54,415 --> 01:40:56,280
Famous actor, P. U Chinnappa

1381
01:40:56,417 --> 01:40:57,884
Yes, l know him very well.

1382
01:40:59,720 --> 01:41:02,587
He was acting in a play
in his village last night.

1383
01:41:02,790 --> 01:41:04,690
He started having a terrible
toothache right afterthe show.

1384
01:41:07,961 --> 01:41:08,723
Open your mouth, sir.

1385
01:41:15,636 --> 01:41:18,571
Two teeth have gone bad.
That is the reason for the pain

1386
01:41:18,672 --> 01:41:19,832
What should be done now?

1387
01:41:20,641 --> 01:41:22,302
Must take out both the teeth.

1388
01:41:22,409 --> 01:41:23,808
Oh! lt will hurt.

1389
01:41:24,411 --> 01:41:26,072
lf we don't remove them,
the pain won't stop.

1390
01:41:27,247 --> 01:41:28,475
All right, get it done with.

1391
01:41:33,720 --> 01:41:34,482
Open your mouth.

1392
01:41:38,659 --> 01:41:39,626
Spit.

1393
01:41:42,296 --> 01:41:43,092
Have you taken them out?

1394
01:41:43,230 --> 01:41:44,197
Not yet.

1395
01:41:44,798 --> 01:41:57,370
{ Rockers }

1396
01:41:57,978 --> 01:41:59,309
The pain has subsided.

1397
01:42:02,916 --> 01:42:04,907
lt is as though l have got back life.

1398
01:42:05,853 --> 01:42:08,515
l am a famous actor
in both drama and cinema.

1399
01:42:08,856 --> 01:42:10,983
Have you seen my latest film?

1400
01:42:14,561 --> 01:42:17,394
Have you seen my latest film?
- No.

1401
01:42:17,631 --> 01:42:20,930
l am a super-hero in it,
who holds a sword...

1402
01:42:21,034 --> 01:42:23,832
...in one hand and cuts down ...

1403
01:42:24,004 --> 01:42:25,596
hundreds of opponents.

1404
01:42:26,240 --> 01:42:29,038
But this super-hero
had to admit defeat...

1405
01:42:29,109 --> 01:42:30,599
...while facing this
small toothache, sir.

1406
01:42:33,347 --> 01:42:34,780
lndeed, you are
a very skilled doctor.

1407
01:42:36,917 --> 01:42:38,316
He is notjust a doctor, boss.

1408
01:42:38,752 --> 01:42:43,212
He is a film maker who has
made the first movie in Malayalam.

1409
01:42:43,724 --> 01:42:45,783
ls that so? Vanakkam, boss.

1410
01:42:45,893 --> 01:42:47,155
Let me touch your
feet and pay obeisance.

1411
01:42:47,261 --> 01:42:48,819
Oh, it's nothing.

1412
01:42:48,962 --> 01:42:51,453
l just made a movie out of desire then.
l stopped all that now.

1413
01:42:51,598 --> 01:42:55,500
Why did you stop?

1414
01:42:55,602 --> 01:42:57,934
Can't you make a movie,
while continuing your practice?

1415
01:43:00,707 --> 01:43:01,901
No, it won't be right again.

1416
01:43:02,009 --> 01:43:04,000
Why? Why won't it be all right?

1417
01:43:05,012 --> 01:43:07,412
Your mind is still in movies,
isn't it?

1418
01:43:07,948 --> 01:43:11,111
lt is not like that.

1419
01:43:11,485 --> 01:43:15,216
lf you say it is not like that,
it means, it is.

1420
01:43:16,156 --> 01:43:19,216
lsn't it? lt is.

1421
01:43:20,260 --> 01:43:24,253
lf you have art in your mind,
it refuses to go away.

1422
01:43:24,498 --> 01:43:25,863
lf you have desire, take...

1423
01:43:26,867 --> 01:43:30,963
Come to Madras.
Take a Tamil film. l will act.

1424
01:43:33,407 --> 01:43:37,468
A great star of those
days like P U Chinnappan.

1425
01:43:38,212 --> 01:43:40,180
l fell for his flattery.

1426
01:43:41,048 --> 01:43:45,712
The zeal for cinema in my
subconscious mind came out again.

1427
01:43:46,820 --> 01:43:49,755
Janet warned me against
it several times.

1428
01:43:50,824 --> 01:43:52,018
l did not heed her.

1429
01:43:53,026 --> 01:43:57,588
l went to Madras with everything
l had earned till then.

1430
01:43:58,265 --> 01:43:59,630
To see Chinnappa...

1431
01:43:59,833 --> 01:44:04,167
To make a Tamil film.
But when l reached Madras...

1432
01:44:04,371 --> 01:44:06,168
Chinnappa's attitude changed.

1433
01:44:07,274 --> 01:44:10,607
He and his followers
really cheated me.

1434
01:44:12,012 --> 01:44:15,106
Life became wayward
when l joined their company.

1435
01:44:16,049 --> 01:44:18,279
All the money l had
brought was spent.

1436
01:44:19,853 --> 01:44:21,684
l became totally crestfallen.

1437
01:44:23,824 --> 01:44:26,816
l did not come home
for about two years.

1438
01:44:27,928 --> 01:44:30,123
l did not contact
Janet and my children.

1439
01:44:31,999 --> 01:44:35,093
l never considered how they lived.

1440
01:44:36,003 --> 01:44:38,437
With this,
Daniel ceased to be Daniel.

1441
01:44:39,239 --> 01:44:41,298
l came to detest cinema.

1442
01:44:41,942 --> 01:44:44,001
Even though l returned
to Agastheeshwaram...

1443
01:44:44,111 --> 01:44:47,512
and started the clinic,
life didn't flourish.

1444
01:44:48,649 --> 01:44:51,618
Patients ceased to come
when my hands started shivering...

1445
01:44:51,752 --> 01:44:53,310
while extracting teeth.

1446
01:44:54,388 --> 01:44:57,755
Thus J C Daniel ceased
to be a dentist...

1447
01:44:58,692 --> 01:45:00,717
...as he ceased to be a film-maker.

1448
01:45:07,067 --> 01:45:09,365
Meanwhile, l did not give proper...

1449
01:45:09,603 --> 01:45:11,969
...care of my children
who were growing up.

1450
01:45:12,906 --> 01:45:17,605
So it is not fairto
expect anything from them.

1451
01:45:20,280 --> 01:45:21,804
They went their separate ways.

1452
01:45:24,051 --> 01:45:27,214
Only she stayed with me,
sharing love...

1453
01:45:27,387 --> 01:45:33,724
...hatred, sorrow and starvation.

1454
01:45:38,832 --> 01:45:40,766
l read in a newspaper
the other day...

1455
01:45:41,535 --> 01:45:46,199
D W Griffith, the master film-maker
of silent movies wandered about...

1456
01:45:46,573 --> 01:45:49,303
the streets of Hollywood,

1457
01:45:49,576 --> 01:45:53,808
like an unwanted beggar,
in his last days.

1458
01:45:56,116 --> 01:46:00,018
lf that is so,
like l tell her it is little wonder...

1459
01:46:00,220 --> 01:46:04,714
...that a nobody like
J C Daniel is steeped in poverty.

1460
01:46:14,234 --> 01:46:19,365
Balan is the first movie for
the historians of Malayalam cinema.

1461
01:46:19,740 --> 01:46:21,901
They do not know you.

1462
01:46:22,743 --> 01:46:24,404
They do not know
Vigathakumaran either.

1463
01:46:26,246 --> 01:46:29,773
Shall l make an attempt?

1464
01:46:30,283 --> 01:46:34,242
Shouldn't the world know that
there was such a film before Balan?

1465
01:46:36,189 --> 01:46:39,317
Where is Vigathakumaran's
reels now?

1466
01:46:43,130 --> 01:46:47,760
What is the value of the film reels
of a movie which nobody wants?

1467
01:46:48,468 --> 01:46:50,902
lt has all been destroyed.

1468
01:47:11,324 --> 01:47:17,729
This is all
l have of Vigathakumaran.

1469
01:47:18,131 --> 01:47:42,115
{ Rockers }

1470
01:47:51,198 --> 01:47:55,066
What you say may be true.
He may even have made this movie.

1471
01:47:56,336 --> 01:47:58,429
l have also heard
of Mathanda Varma.

1472
01:47:58,705 --> 01:48:02,072
But... in government records,
Balan is the first Malayalam movie.

1473
01:48:02,843 --> 01:48:04,708
We can recognize a film
as belonging to a language...

1474
01:48:04,845 --> 01:48:06,176
only if it is a talkies.

1475
01:48:06,346 --> 01:48:08,507
What are you saying l must do...

1476
01:48:08,648 --> 01:48:10,513
- because someone has made
half a movie or a piece of it?

1477
01:48:11,084 --> 01:48:12,312
You must add the name of

1478
01:48:12,486 --> 01:48:14,454
- Vigathakumaran...
in government records.

1479
01:48:14,788 --> 01:48:18,224
The world must know that
this is Malayalam's first movie.

1480
01:48:18,692 --> 01:48:20,319
Sir, you must take the initiative
to tell the Chief Minister...

1481
01:48:20,460 --> 01:48:21,757
and put the records straight.

1482
01:48:22,896 --> 01:48:23,760
lt is difficult.

1483
01:48:24,231 --> 01:48:27,064
He doesn't have the print
of the movie, does he?

1484
01:48:27,634 --> 01:48:30,831
Who will believe you
if you show this photo and notice...

1485
01:48:31,037 --> 01:48:32,163
and say there was such a movie?

1486
01:48:32,339 --> 01:48:34,330
Sir, he is still alive.
So what?

1487
01:48:34,875 --> 01:48:37,810
The camera and
print of the film made by...

1488
01:48:37,978 --> 01:48:39,468
Lumiere Brothers are
still carefully kept.

1489
01:48:39,779 --> 01:48:41,576
People still see that film.

1490
01:48:42,115 --> 01:48:44,913
Phalke's Raja Harischandra is
also in the the Pune Film Archives.

1491
01:48:45,118 --> 01:48:47,848
Ask him to bring me such proof.
Then we will see.

1492
01:48:48,355 --> 01:48:50,915
Sir, why are you talking
with such lack of interest?

1493
01:48:51,191 --> 01:48:53,557
lsn't it a film made by a Malayali?

1494
01:48:54,227 --> 01:48:58,527
Why are you so interested
in this film made by a Nadar?

1495
01:48:59,366 --> 01:49:02,995
Sir, l have now understood
what your interests are...

1496
01:49:03,336 --> 01:49:06,328
Balan happens to be a film
made by a Brahmin, T R Sundaram.

1497
01:49:07,207 --> 01:49:10,870
l didn't figure you were
thinking on the lines of caste.

1498
01:49:24,357 --> 01:49:27,622
What did Daniel say?

1499
01:49:32,165 --> 01:49:33,564
lt is the same condition there...

1500
01:49:40,807 --> 01:49:42,001
Do not cry.

1501
01:49:43,810 --> 01:49:46,711
We had lived like kings.

1502
01:49:49,649 --> 01:49:53,551
The only thing that we did
wrong was that we made cinema.

1503
01:49:54,287 --> 01:50:12,263
{ Rockers }

1504
01:50:12,839 --> 01:50:15,603
Father, now weeps at
the slightest provocation.

1505
01:50:16,176 --> 01:50:18,474
He started a ration shop
when the film flopped...

1506
01:50:18,678 --> 01:50:20,009
...and there was no other way.

1507
01:50:20,347 --> 01:50:23,248
Father looked
after it till he became ill.

1508
01:50:23,950 --> 01:50:25,417
Now l have taken over.

1509
01:50:27,687 --> 01:50:29,678
C K Soman here says that
the old film trunk is in...

1510
01:50:29,923 --> 01:50:32,619
- ...the godown of
Kamalalayam Book Depot.

1511
01:50:32,959 --> 01:50:34,221
We will go there and see.

1512
01:50:34,761 --> 01:50:36,251
Father has no rights to that now.

1513
01:50:36,563 --> 01:50:37,928
lt belongs to them.

1514
01:50:38,598 --> 01:50:39,724
When the book depot shut down...

1515
01:50:39,899 --> 01:50:42,163
my father kept the film
trunk in the store of this lodge.

1516
01:50:42,435 --> 01:50:45,632
from time to time,
saying that the print should...

1517
01:50:45,805 --> 01:50:48,137
...be sent to Madras for cleaning.

1518
01:50:48,541 --> 01:50:50,975
Father sent it for cleaning
once ortwice, at his expense.

1519
01:50:51,144 --> 01:50:52,873
Now, no one looks after it.

1520
01:51:00,020 --> 01:51:04,320
Soman had written to P K Nair of
the Poona Film Archives...

1521
01:51:04,624 --> 01:51:08,219
lf you put a price and sell it,
the Archives would buy it.

1522
01:51:08,595 --> 01:51:11,063
lsn't that better than
it being destroyed here?

1523
01:51:13,633 --> 01:51:14,861
This is history.

1524
01:51:15,168 --> 01:51:18,399
Only time will prove its worth.

1525
01:51:18,705 --> 01:51:21,572
The print is
in the Poona Film Archives.

1526
01:51:22,242 --> 01:51:25,700
But for a slight damage to
one ortwo reels, the rest is OK...

1527
01:51:26,546 --> 01:51:29,174
Good.

1528
01:51:30,383 --> 01:51:34,786
Like me, Sundera Rajan also made
that movie suffering much hardship.

1529
01:51:35,822 --> 01:51:39,451
At least his suffering
has not been in vain.

1530
01:51:40,994 --> 01:51:44,953
Vigathakumaran did not have that luck,
isn't it, Daniel Sir?

1531
01:51:48,334 --> 01:51:50,461
Never mind.

1532
01:51:50,937 --> 01:51:54,998
l don't have any complaints.

1533
01:51:56,076 --> 01:51:58,442
lt's my own fault.

1534
01:52:01,848 --> 01:52:08,583
l never thought it should
be preserved carefully.

1535
01:52:16,696 --> 01:52:18,254
ls Vayalar Ramavarma in?

1536
01:52:18,364 --> 01:52:20,730
Yes...in 101 ...he's writing...

1537
01:52:20,867 --> 01:52:22,391
l know. l have told
him l would be coming...

1538
01:52:28,842 --> 01:52:29,570
Come in.

1539
01:52:32,612 --> 01:52:34,011
Hi, Chelangadan!

1540
01:52:38,017 --> 01:52:40,178
What's the latest cinema news?

1541
01:52:40,453 --> 01:52:42,478
Will tell you.
Are you in the writing mood?

1542
01:52:42,622 --> 01:52:45,022
Never mind. Lyrics
will come, anyway.

1543
01:52:45,391 --> 01:52:47,723
Chelangadan will make
his visits in between.

1544
01:52:48,394 --> 01:52:50,123
lt isn't a new occurrence now, is it?

1545
01:52:50,530 --> 01:52:52,896
Didn't l tell you about J C Daniel?

1546
01:52:53,099 --> 01:52:57,092
Yes, the neglected
father of Malayalam cinema.

1547
01:52:58,671 --> 01:53:00,366
That is the bad fortune of an artist.

1548
01:53:01,007 --> 01:53:03,202
l will also come with
you if l get the time.

1549
01:53:03,443 --> 01:53:05,308
l would also like to see him.

1550
01:53:06,045 --> 01:53:09,606
He had a stroke meanwhile.
Now he is bedridden.

1551
01:53:11,251 --> 01:53:14,186
This is the letter sent by his wife.
Please read this.

1552
01:53:18,825 --> 01:53:20,383
Dear Mr Gopalakrishnan...

1553
01:53:21,127 --> 01:53:24,893
l got the copy of the book
The History of Cinema. l am glad.

1554
01:53:25,165 --> 01:53:30,034
l read it out to my husband,
who is blind now.

1555
01:53:30,403 --> 01:53:33,736
He is now in a critical condition.

1556
01:53:34,040 --> 01:53:38,443
He cannot do things by himself.

1557
01:53:38,912 --> 01:53:41,244
We are living in extreme poverty.

1558
01:53:42,048 --> 01:53:47,884
We are hoping that you
will help us... in some way.

1559
01:53:48,154 --> 01:53:50,645
Praying to God with tears.

1560
01:53:51,191 --> 01:53:52,681
What can we do?

1561
01:53:53,193 --> 01:53:56,856
l met both that
reactionary secretary and...

1562
01:53:57,030 --> 01:53:58,725
...the Chief Minister
to talk about...Vigathakumaran.

1563
01:53:59,065 --> 01:54:00,054
But they drove me out.

1564
01:54:00,667 --> 01:54:03,295
They talked as if l had something
to gain out of this.

1565
01:54:03,870 --> 01:54:05,997
He is a great man of letters...
...and a lover of art.

1566
01:54:06,139 --> 01:54:08,004
But he is not humane.

1567
01:54:08,408 --> 01:54:11,866
He could have easily
helped if he had wanted to.

1568
01:54:12,712 --> 01:54:15,203
That Cultural Secretary
is your close friend, isn't he?

1569
01:54:15,348 --> 01:54:18,374
lf you call him, l will go
once again and lick his boots.

1570
01:54:19,419 --> 01:54:21,011
He is good for everything else.

1571
01:54:21,387 --> 01:54:25,949
But he has the dirty outlook
of the upper classes sometimes.

1572
01:54:33,666 --> 01:54:36,829
Yes, l am Vayalar... need an urgent
trunk call to Thiruvananthapuram...

1573
01:54:37,537 --> 01:54:39,300
Number 2134.

1574
01:54:45,745 --> 01:54:48,213
That's a song in Sethu's new film,
Achanum Bappayum...

1575
01:54:48,948 --> 01:54:51,109
Devarajan is waiting
with the harmonium...

1576
01:54:51,818 --> 01:54:54,286
Have to go to Madras today.
Have a look.

1577
01:54:55,788 --> 01:55:02,990
''Man created creeds.''

1578
01:55:03,296 --> 01:55:10,793
''Creeds created Gods.''

1579
01:55:11,137 --> 01:55:20,944
''Man and creeds and Gods
together shared the land...''

1580
01:55:21,314 --> 01:55:25,250
'' shared the mind...''

1581
01:55:26,953 --> 01:55:28,318
Why don't you say something, sir?

1582
01:55:29,355 --> 01:55:33,348
You made Rama Varma call me
because you felt l would yield?

1583
01:55:33,593 --> 01:55:34,821
What else can l do?

1584
01:55:35,061 --> 01:55:36,585
You didn't listen to me
when l told you that day.

1585
01:55:36,763 --> 01:55:40,426
l agree with what you say.
He is bedridden following a stroke...

1586
01:55:40,633 --> 01:55:41,793
He is suffering
hardships and poverty.

1587
01:55:41,968 --> 01:55:44,835
But on what grounds can the Kerala
Government give him pension?

1588
01:55:44,938 --> 01:55:46,371
How can we give him financial aid?

1589
01:55:46,472 --> 01:55:50,238
lsn't he a Tamilian living
in Tamil Nadu, in Agastheeswaram.

1590
01:55:51,010 --> 01:55:52,978
Tell him to apply to
the Tamil Nadu Government...

1591
01:55:53,146 --> 01:55:55,614
He was born and brought
up at the Travancore of yore.

1592
01:55:55,848 --> 01:55:58,316
Didn't Kerala extend upto
Kanyakumari in those days?

1593
01:55:58,918 --> 01:56:01,944
He studied and made the
movie in Thiruvanthapuram.

1594
01:56:02,255 --> 01:56:04,815
Didn't he make the
movie in Malayalam?

1595
01:56:05,158 --> 01:56:07,319
Why should the Tamil Nadu
Government give him pension...

1596
01:56:07,527 --> 01:56:08,425
for making a picture in Malayalam?

1597
01:56:09,662 --> 01:56:11,857
You come with a print of the movie...

1598
01:56:11,998 --> 01:56:13,625
just like you found a print
of Mathanda Varma.

1599
01:56:13,766 --> 01:56:14,164
Then we will see.

1600
01:56:14,300 --> 01:56:15,892
Sir, l have already
told you it doesn't exist.

1601
01:56:16,102 --> 01:56:16,693
Then what can l do?

1602
01:56:16,970 --> 01:56:18,699
Even if l send it to
the Chief Minister's office...

1603
01:56:18,805 --> 01:56:20,295
it will be returned unsigned.

1604
01:56:20,540 --> 01:56:23,703
Sir, are you making lame excuses
in order to deny him his due?

1605
01:56:24,510 --> 01:56:25,306
Get out!

1606
01:56:28,448 --> 01:56:31,315
We will recognize
him after he is dead.

1607
01:56:31,551 --> 01:56:33,610
lsn't that our usual practice?

1608
01:56:34,287 --> 01:56:46,256
{ Rockers }

1609
01:56:47,200 --> 01:56:51,330
As you lie in this condition,none
of our children is here, Daniel...

1610
01:57:00,179 --> 01:57:05,640
lt's not that they don't have love.
They don't have the time

1611
01:57:09,455 --> 01:57:10,217
Don't worry.

1612
01:57:11,591 --> 01:57:14,822
Even if no one is here,
aren't l by your side?

1613
01:57:27,273 --> 01:57:28,934
Do you see, Janet?

1614
01:57:31,811 --> 01:57:34,109
lsn't it the Capitol hall?

1615
01:57:41,621 --> 01:57:44,021
Do you see what is being
written on the screen?

1616
01:57:50,496 --> 01:57:51,793
Vigathakumaran.

1617
01:58:00,540 --> 01:58:02,098
Can you see Janet?

1618
01:58:02,575 --> 01:58:49,422
{ Rockers }

1619
01:58:49,422 --> 01:59:45,241
{ Rockers }

1620
01:59:46,045 --> 01:59:51,483
J C Daniel suffered the same fate
shared by many talented geniuses.

1621
01:59:52,151 --> 01:59:55,917
His is the same old
story of being ignored...

1622
01:59:56,055 --> 01:59:59,115
...and rejected in his lifetime.

1623
02:00:00,760 --> 02:00:08,030
lt is with the hope that his work
will be recognized one day

1624
02:00:08,234 --> 02:00:09,826
that l went on with my
mission even after his death.

1625
02:00:10,570 --> 02:00:11,229
ln the end,

1626
02:00:11,537 --> 02:00:15,029
it is with the formation
of the Kerala State

1627
02:00:15,208 --> 02:00:16,539
Film Development Corporation

1628
02:00:17,009 --> 02:00:22,208
that the Kerala Government
recognized J C Daniel

1629
02:00:22,381 --> 02:00:24,713
as the father of
Malayalam cinema,

1630
02:00:24,850 --> 02:00:25,817
and Vigathakumaran as
the first film in Malayalam.

1631
02:00:26,052 --> 02:00:28,782
Even when hundreds of
films were produced each year

1632
02:00:29,155 --> 02:00:31,646
and Malayalam cinema
was recognized by the world...

1633
02:00:32,058 --> 02:00:35,858
winning several national
and international awards...

1634
02:00:35,995 --> 02:00:41,934
we failed to realize that
the father of Malayalam cinema...

1635
02:00:42,068 --> 02:00:46,129
and its first heroine lived
somewhere among us in anonymity.

1636
02:00:46,939 --> 02:00:51,706
On this occasion,
when the documentary directed by

1637
02:00:51,844 --> 02:00:58,272
Sri R Gopalakrishnan
is to be screened,

1638
02:00:58,618 --> 02:01:01,712
l would like to introduce you...
to a special individual,

1639
02:01:01,954 --> 02:01:05,219
who has come on the invitation
of Sri Gopalakrishnan...

1640
02:01:05,558 --> 02:01:10,291
- the youngest son of J C
Daniel,Sri Harris Daniel.

1641
02:01:11,163 --> 02:01:35,147
{ Rockers }

1642
02:01:35,755 --> 02:01:39,885
l invite Harris Daniel to talk to us.

1643
02:01:50,236 --> 02:01:53,831
When you applaud
me in the name of my Papa

1644
02:01:53,973 --> 02:01:55,201
l do not know what to say.

1645
02:01:58,344 --> 02:02:01,142
l am J C Daniel's youngest son.

1646
02:02:01,847 --> 02:02:05,544
l hadn't been born when
Papa made Vigathakumaran.

1647
02:02:07,219 --> 02:02:09,244
l only rememberthe J C
Daniel who brooded in a corner...

1648
02:02:09,422 --> 02:02:13,256
having lost everything,
aftertrying to make a film in Madras,

1649
02:02:13,426 --> 02:02:18,489
- and after giving up dentistry.

1650
02:02:19,899 --> 02:02:28,773
l don't know why, but l always
preferred to stay aloof from Papa.

1651
02:02:31,344 --> 02:02:36,179
l have never tried
to understand Papa.

1652
02:02:36,916 --> 02:02:42,616
As Chelangad Sir said, had a piece
of the film Papa made remained...

1653
02:02:42,855 --> 02:02:47,656
he would have been
recognized in his own lifetime.

1654
02:02:49,495 --> 02:02:52,293
lf that had been so,
l too would have known...

1655
02:02:52,398 --> 02:02:56,357
...his greatness while he lived.

1656
02:02:57,303 --> 02:03:03,674
ln my childhood, l failed to recognize
the greatness of that movie...

1657
02:03:04,944 --> 02:03:08,607
That is why it has
happened this way.

1658
02:03:09,148 --> 02:03:11,639
The ignorance of a six-year-old.

1659
02:03:12,752 --> 02:03:17,121
The person responsible for the
non-existence of a single piece...

1660
02:03:17,356 --> 02:03:21,884
- of that movie is not
Papa... not anyone else...

1661
02:03:23,796 --> 02:03:26,128
l am responsible for it.

1662
02:03:27,500 --> 02:04:22,113
{ Rockers }

1663
02:04:23,022 --> 02:04:26,719
lt was l who burnt those reels.

1664
02:04:30,796 --> 02:04:33,629
l did not know then that the childhood
mischief of a six-year-old...

1665
02:04:34,800 --> 02:04:39,328
- would turn out to be
such a cruel entertainment.

1666
02:04:42,708 --> 02:04:46,200
lt may have been the aversion
Papa felt towards the world...

1667
02:04:46,445 --> 02:04:48,913
- and towards cinema
that made him gaze

1668
02:04:49,048 --> 02:04:50,879
- at my mischief like a bystander.

1669
02:04:53,052 --> 02:05:05,260
l apologize to Papa...

1670
02:05:05,397 --> 02:05:11,267
- and to Malayalam cinema...
for my childhood mischief.
