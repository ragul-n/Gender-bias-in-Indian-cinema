00:00:04,933 --> 00:00:06,974

00:00:09,831 --> 00:00:12,121
(babies crying)

19

Oh, dang it.

20
00:01:21,027 --> 00:01:23,106
Eat this.

21
00:01:23,107 --> 00:01:24,106
I'm not hungry.

22
00:01:24,107 --> 00:01:25,460
Fascinating. Eat this.

23
00:01:25,461 --> 00:01:27,481
And drink this.

24
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:30,048
You two are terrifying
when you're in agreement.

25
00:01:30,049 --> 00:01:31,789
- Get used to it.
- ELIZABETH: You don't have to know

26
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:33,838
all that stuff by heart, you know.

27
00:01:33,839 --> 00:01:35,338
I want to be prepared.

28
00:01:35,339 --> 00:01:38,023
Classified briefs?
The CIA doesn't even read those.

29
00:01:38,024 --> 00:01:39,707
If you look too smart
on the first day of school,

30
00:01:39,708 --> 00:01:40,747
the other kids won't like you.

31
00:01:40,748 --> 00:01:42,287
(laughs)

32
00:01:42,288 --> 00:01:43,787
Hey, Dad.

33
00:01:43,788 --> 00:01:44,583
Hey.

34
00:01:44,584 --> 00:01:45,377
You look terrible.

35
00:01:45,378 --> 00:01:46,333
Thanks, honey.

36
00:01:46,334 --> 00:01:47,768
Crazy for you

37
00:01:47,769 --> 00:01:48,818
to be starting a new job.

38
00:01:48,819 --> 00:01:50,818
I mean, you just got
out of the hospital.

39
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,818
It's not a new job;
it's more like an aspect

40
00:01:52,819 --> 00:01:55,108
of what I'm doing at the War
College, only less teaching.

41
00:01:55,109 --> 00:01:56,608
So what is it, exactly?

42
00:01:56,609 --> 00:01:58,268
Consulting.

43
00:01:58,269 --> 00:02:00,728
Everybody knows what
that's code for, Dad.

44
00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:02,212
It's intelligence work.

45
00:02:02,213 --> 00:02:03,672
Jace, I'm employed by
the Defense Department.

46
00:02:03,674 --> 00:02:05,173
You're not blowing the
lid off of anything

47
00:02:05,174 --> 00:02:06,333
with that observation.

48
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:07,503
It just seems so soon.

49
00:02:07,504 --> 00:02:08,395
I'm fine, Noodle, really.

50
00:02:08,396 --> 00:02:09,635
Look, eating eggs, drinking juice.

51
00:02:09,636 --> 00:02:12,446
Reading some counter-terrorism...
breakfast of champions.

52
00:02:15,217 --> 00:02:16,491
How are you guys doing?

53
00:02:16,492 --> 00:02:17,387
ELIZABETH: You know you guys can

54
00:02:17,388 --> 00:02:18,803
talk to us about anything.

55
00:02:18,804 --> 00:02:20,263
You went through a lot.

56
00:02:20,264 --> 00:02:22,464
- That goes for adult children, too.
- STEVIE: I know.

57
00:02:22,467 --> 00:02:23,883
I'm fine.

58
00:02:23,884 --> 00:02:26,633
Pre-law is a very
overwhelming distraction.

59
00:02:26,634 --> 00:02:28,343
ELIZABETH: What about
that guy you were seeing,

60
00:02:28,344 --> 00:02:29,673
the one with the cute butt?

61
00:02:29,674 --> 00:02:30,633
Mom!

62
00:02:30,634 --> 00:02:32,093
Well, uh, <i>you </i>said it.

63
00:02:32,094 --> 00:02:32,929
Garrett, was it?

64
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:33,763
Jareth.

65
00:02:33,764 --> 00:02:35,803
David Bowie's character
in the <i>Labyrinth?</i>

66
00:02:35,804 --> 00:02:37,263
You're dating the Goblin King?

67
00:02:37,264 --> 00:02:39,633
God, you guys, he's never
heard that one before.

68
00:02:39,634 --> 00:02:40,843
So how is he?

69
00:02:40,844 --> 00:02:42,554
He's fine.

70
00:02:43,594 --> 00:02:44,803
We've been busy.

71
00:02:44,804 --> 00:02:46,448
I... (sighs) This conversation

72
00:02:46,449 --> 00:02:48,302
is far more stressful
than the dirty bomb, okay?

73
00:02:48,303 --> 00:02:50,004
That's gallows humor;
it's a coping method.

74
00:02:50,029 --> 00:02:50,647
(mock gasp)

75
00:02:51,575 --> 00:02:52,825
- We want to meet him.
- Bye.

76
00:02:52,827 --> 00:02:55,074
- I won't say the David Bowie thing.
- (chuckles)

77
00:02:55,077 --> 00:02:57,363
(phone vibrates)

78
00:02:57,364 --> 00:02:58,449
(sighs)

79
00:02:58,450 --> 00:02:59,533
White House or State?

80
00:02:59,534 --> 00:03:00,613
White House.

81
00:03:00,614 --> 00:03:02,273
But it's just a text from Blake,

82
00:03:02,274 --> 00:03:05,403
so likely three rungs
down from imminent doom.

83
00:03:05,404 --> 00:03:06,654
(chuckles softly)

84
00:03:11,484 --> 00:03:13,533
(sighs)

85
00:03:13,534 --> 00:03:15,653
ELIZABETH: Make sure your father

86
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:17,654
finishes his breakfast.

87
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:20,587
REEVES: <i>Just after 0400 hours,</i>

88
00:03:20,588 --> 00:03:23,126
a ship carrying Libyan
refugees to Italy

89
00:03:23,128 --> 00:03:25,207
sent out a distress call
during a heavy storm.

90
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:28,903
At great risk, an Italian
Navy warship answered,

91
00:03:28,904 --> 00:03:29,518
managed to save

92
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,714
all 243 souls aboard,

93
00:03:31,715 --> 00:03:35,344
including a man who claims to
have seen Jibral Disah in Libya

94
00:03:35,345 --> 00:03:36,741
<i>since </i>the attack.

95
00:03:36,742 --> 00:03:38,451
JACKSON: We only have
20 minutes to decide

96
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:39,741
whether to question him.

97
00:03:39,742 --> 00:03:41,951
Or, in keeping with their policy,

98
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:44,661
the Italians will return
the refugees to Libya.

99
00:03:44,662 --> 00:03:48,624
Which is... now overrun
by Hizb Al-Shahid,

100
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:49,661
so we'd probably lose

101
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:52,876
whatever potential Intel
this man has forever.

102
00:03:52,877 --> 00:03:54,235
BECKER: Or he may not
have even seen Disah.

103
00:03:54,236 --> 00:03:56,347
Just looking to get off a sinking boat.

104
00:03:56,348 --> 00:03:58,194
But what do we know, Ephraim?

105
00:03:58,195 --> 00:03:59,799
Moussa Al-Mukhtar is

106
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,469
a Libyan mechanic
from the HS stronghold

107
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,679
of Ajdabiya who claims

108
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,379
that he was conscripted
to fix their vehicles.

109
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,589
He says HS threatened his family

110
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,259
if he didn't pledge loyalty.

111
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:14,009
So they left ASAP for Italy.

112
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:16,009
General Reeves,
how soon can we pick him up?

113
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:17,549
ELIZABETH: Sir, I would advise

114
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,339
against bringing him onto our ship.

115
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:20,589
If news that the U.S.

116
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:23,339
is taking custody of
this refugee gets out,

117
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,788
it could telegraph our
lead to the enemy.

118
00:04:25,789 --> 00:04:26,687
BECKER: Mr. President,

119
00:04:26,688 --> 00:04:29,346
it doesn't matter where
we debrief this man.

120
00:04:29,347 --> 00:04:31,516
The fact is,
we're grasping at straws here.

121
00:04:31,517 --> 00:04:33,346
JACKSON: I'm no military man,

122
00:04:33,347 --> 00:04:36,136
but I'm pretty good with facts,
and the fact is,

123
00:04:36,137 --> 00:04:39,396
Hizb Al-Shahid set off
a radiological weapon

124
00:04:39,397 --> 00:04:40,976
in the United States.

125
00:04:40,977 --> 00:04:42,896
They still have enough
lethal nuclear material

126
00:04:42,897 --> 00:04:44,596
for three more bombs,
which Jibral Disah

127
00:04:44,597 --> 00:04:47,896
won't hesitate to use against us.

128
00:04:47,897 --> 00:04:51,476
And as to his-his location,
we know precisely...

129
00:04:51,477 --> 00:04:53,936
and again, I don't know the
military parlance here...

130
00:04:53,937 --> 00:04:55,596
jack diddly squat.

131
00:04:55,597 --> 00:04:58,016
So even if this mechanic is a straw,

132
00:04:58,017 --> 00:05:00,186
I propose we grasp it
with both damn hands

133
00:05:00,187 --> 00:05:02,436
before a bomb goes off in Times Square.

134
00:05:02,437 --> 00:05:04,726
Is it still our sacred duty

135
00:05:04,727 --> 00:05:06,306
to protect the American way of life,

136
00:05:06,307 --> 00:05:08,517
or am I missing something here?

137
00:05:11,847 --> 00:05:14,016
Excuse me, sir.

138
00:05:14,017 --> 00:05:17,016
Well, I guess that answers that.

139
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:18,976
Keep the operation light.

140
00:05:18,977 --> 00:05:22,136
Tell the Italians that CIA
interrogators are on the way.

141
00:05:22,137 --> 00:05:24,976
This could be the break
we've been looking for.

142
00:05:24,977 --> 00:05:27,267
Yes, sir.

143
00:05:28,307 --> 00:05:30,727
Well, that was thorough.

144
00:05:32,267 --> 00:05:34,806
Are they gonna make you
sign me in every day?

145
00:05:34,807 --> 00:05:36,476
Security's extra spooked.

146
00:05:36,477 --> 00:05:39,596
And only top levels are aware
of Hizb Al-Shahid Issue Station.

147
00:05:39,597 --> 00:05:41,807
- Tell me there's a code name.
- Murphy Station.

148
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:43,596
For the soap... it's a cleanup mission.

149
00:05:43,597 --> 00:05:45,846
So code names not your gift?

150
00:05:45,847 --> 00:05:48,766
I was in a hurry.
And we need to catch you up.

151
00:05:48,767 --> 00:05:51,396
Welcome to Murphy Station.

152
00:05:51,397 --> 00:05:54,846
As everybody knows,
this is the front line

153
00:05:54,847 --> 00:05:57,636
for our single most important
national security priority:

154
00:05:57,637 --> 00:06:00,896
to disrupt and dismantle
Hizb Al-Shahid.

155
00:06:00,897 --> 00:06:02,516
Meet your fellow team members.

156
00:06:02,517 --> 00:06:03,896
Mimi Jacobs,

157
00:06:03,897 --> 00:06:06,846
ex-FBI counter-terrorism
turned CIA analyst,

158
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:08,636
with expertise in interrogations.

159
00:06:08,637 --> 00:06:11,846
Masterminds of the U.S.S. <i>Cole
</i>and Riyadh compound attacks.

160
00:06:11,847 --> 00:06:13,806
It was all her.

161
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:16,726
It's possible I had some help.
It's good to meet you.

162
00:06:16,727 --> 00:06:17,936
Henry McCord.

163
00:06:17,937 --> 00:06:19,976
This is Jose Campos, ex-Special Forces,

164
00:06:19,977 --> 00:06:23,936
senior Intel CIA operative
with tours in Pakistan,

165
00:06:23,937 --> 00:06:25,516
Afghanistan and Iraq.

166
00:06:25,517 --> 00:06:27,976
If you're glad the Taliban
government fell, thank him.

167
00:06:27,977 --> 00:06:29,476
All in a day's work, huh?

168
00:06:29,477 --> 00:06:30,636
And you know Jane Fellows,

169
00:06:30,637 --> 00:06:32,266
Army captain, long stint at SOCOM,

170
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:34,056
currently head of HUMINT at DIA.

171
00:06:34,057 --> 00:06:36,136
She's a lauded tactician
who's run enough

172
00:06:36,137 --> 00:06:38,976
covert ops to keep conspiracy
theorists awake at night.

173
00:06:38,977 --> 00:06:40,056
And apparently modest, too.

174
00:06:40,057 --> 00:06:41,726
I didn't know about half that stuff.

175
00:06:41,727 --> 00:06:43,846
(chuckles) Welcome back.
Can't keep a good man down.

176
00:06:43,847 --> 00:06:45,275
Well, when I heard I
didn't have to take orders

177
00:06:45,276 --> 00:06:46,806
from you anymore, they
couldn't keep me away.

178
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:49,766
Henry here is a decorated Marine pilot

179
00:06:49,767 --> 00:06:53,016
whose recent DIA work
in Russia is the reason

180
00:06:53,017 --> 00:06:55,636
we aren't all bundled
up for nuclear winter.

181
00:06:55,637 --> 00:06:58,136
He's also a highly regarded theologian

182
00:06:58,137 --> 00:06:59,726
with expertise in Islam.

183
00:06:59,727 --> 00:07:01,306
We're fighting a radical ideology

184
00:07:01,307 --> 00:07:02,850
as much as any man.

185
00:07:02,851 --> 00:07:06,476
Look, we can talk religion till
the sacred cows come home,

186
00:07:06,477 --> 00:07:07,945
but at the end of the day,

187
00:07:07,946 --> 00:07:09,957
we're a hunter-killer team.

188
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:13,936
We do our job right, and a whole
bunch of men are gonna die.

189
00:07:13,937 --> 00:07:16,016
I hope you're on board
with that, Professor.

190
00:07:16,017 --> 00:07:17,694
All in a day's work, right?

191
00:07:17,695 --> 00:07:18,990
JACKSON: Let's get started.

192
00:07:18,991 --> 00:07:20,320
President's first goal is

193
00:07:20,321 --> 00:07:23,660
the killing or capture of Jibral Disah

194
00:07:23,661 --> 00:07:25,370
before he strikes again.

195
00:07:25,371 --> 00:07:27,200
Now, as we know,

196
00:07:27,201 --> 00:07:29,120
he's been in the wind after escaping

197
00:07:29,121 --> 00:07:31,120
our drone attacks on his safe house.

198
00:07:31,121 --> 00:07:33,626
Leads are scarce;
they're growing scarcer

199
00:07:33,627 --> 00:07:35,580
since several prominent warlords in Libya

200
00:07:35,581 --> 00:07:37,490
declared their loyalty to him.

201
00:07:37,491 --> 00:07:39,990
Tripling HS's territory and fighters.

202
00:07:39,991 --> 00:07:42,080
JACKSON: Idris Al Bouri,
Umar Maziq, Hamza Kubar

203
00:07:42,081 --> 00:07:44,160
have all taken HS's lead

204
00:07:44,161 --> 00:07:47,762
and are engaged in ruthless
campaigns on dissenters.

205
00:07:47,763 --> 00:07:49,490
HENRY: Classic totalitarian tactic.

206
00:07:49,491 --> 00:07:51,854
Subdue the populace
quickly and brutally,

207
00:07:51,855 --> 00:07:54,003
- and no one dares speak up.
- JACKSON: Well, you better find

208
00:07:54,044 --> 00:07:56,173
someone who will, and fast.

209
00:07:56,174 --> 00:07:59,253
The entire Defense and
IC is working this.

210
00:07:59,254 --> 00:08:02,923
POTUS is even quarterbacking
a prospective lead as we speak.

211
00:08:02,924 --> 00:08:04,923
Everything deemed at all credible

212
00:08:04,924 --> 00:08:06,753
will be funneled to this room.

213
00:08:06,754 --> 00:08:09,133
You're the tip of the spear.

214
00:08:09,134 --> 00:08:11,343
The work that happens in this room

215
00:08:11,344 --> 00:08:14,213
could stop the next attack.

216
00:08:14,214 --> 00:08:15,754
Or not.

217
00:08:22,004 --> 00:08:23,804
(phone chimes)

218
00:08:25,835 --> 00:08:27,133
_

219
00:08:29,964 --> 00:08:33,343
So you didn't lose your
phone or let it die.

220
00:08:33,344 --> 00:08:36,003
I, uh... I'll cross those
off the list, then.

221
00:08:36,004 --> 00:08:37,883
Jareth. Hi.

222
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:40,253
Sorry. Um, I was
about to text you back,

223
00:08:40,254 --> 00:08:41,754
but I'm late for class.

224
00:08:43,044 --> 00:08:45,753
Oh. The brotherly hug.

225
00:08:45,754 --> 00:08:47,803
Have I been put in the friend
zone without my knowledge?

226
00:08:47,804 --> 00:08:49,504
- What are you talking about?
- Let's see.

227
00:08:49,507 --> 00:08:51,543
Unanswered calls and texts,

228
00:08:51,544 --> 00:08:53,884
- except for the odd cryptic emoji...
- Sorry. I've been

229
00:08:53,887 --> 00:08:56,004
- so crazy...
- Saying things like "I have been so crazy."

230
00:08:56,007 --> 00:08:58,924
- I'll call you later?
- Saying things like "I'll call you later."

231
00:08:58,927 --> 00:09:00,803
I really will.

232
00:09:00,804 --> 00:09:03,593
I thought we liked each other.

233
00:09:03,594 --> 00:09:06,753
Even talked about me meeting
your family, if I recall.

234
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:08,753
We do like each other.

235
00:09:08,754 --> 00:09:11,044
Honestly, I just... I have to go.

236
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:14,673
Right, well, I'll, uh...

237
00:09:14,674 --> 00:09:16,924
let you get on with it, then.

238
00:09:18,924 --> 00:09:20,303
Bloody hell.

239
00:09:20,304 --> 00:09:21,593
No, I won't, will I?

240
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:23,633
Um, look,

241
00:09:23,634 --> 00:09:26,713
this isn't my first rodeo... cowgirl.

242
00:09:26,714 --> 00:09:30,343
Uh... I know what the
brush-off feels like.

243
00:09:30,344 --> 00:09:33,133
I just thought that you'd be
someone to do it to my face.

244
00:09:33,134 --> 00:09:36,133
Please just do that.

245
00:09:36,134 --> 00:09:37,133
I can't.

246
00:09:37,134 --> 00:09:38,343
Why not?

247
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:39,754
Because it wouldn't be true.

248
00:09:41,964 --> 00:09:44,463
I still really want to see you.

249
00:09:44,464 --> 00:09:46,804
I'm just really late for class.

250
00:09:53,544 --> 00:09:55,044
I'll call you.

251
00:10:01,924 --> 00:10:03,133
(quietly): Hey.

252
00:10:03,134 --> 00:10:04,303
I'm sorry to interrupt.

253
00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:07,383
I just wanted to apologize for Jose.

254
00:10:07,384 --> 00:10:08,843
HENRY: No need. I've met a hundred guys

255
00:10:08,844 --> 00:10:10,543
like him in the Marines.

256
00:10:10,544 --> 00:10:11,883
He's an ops guy.

257
00:10:11,884 --> 00:10:14,843
He spent a little too much
time outside the wire.

258
00:10:14,844 --> 00:10:16,923
And he's naturally suspicious
of analysts like me,

259
00:10:16,924 --> 00:10:18,803
who sit indoors with highlighters,

260
00:10:18,804 --> 00:10:20,923
looking for odd
discrepancies and patterns.

261
00:10:20,924 --> 00:10:23,343
Or professors who spend their day

262
00:10:23,344 --> 00:10:25,593
doing close readings of obscure texts.

263
00:10:25,594 --> 00:10:26,923
(chuckles)

264
00:10:26,924 --> 00:10:29,303
So you're an interrogator, too, yeah?

265
00:10:29,304 --> 00:10:31,463
Yeah, it's not as edgy as it sounds.

266
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,213
You just get them in a room

267
00:10:33,214 --> 00:10:35,883
and establish a rapport
and talk and talk and talk

268
00:10:35,884 --> 00:10:39,543
until some little detail
reveals what's really going on.

269
00:10:39,544 --> 00:10:41,093
Sounds like raising a teenager.

270
00:10:41,094 --> 00:10:43,343
Where do you think I got my skills?

271
00:10:43,344 --> 00:10:44,843
Look alive, people.

272
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:45,883
We have visitors.

273
00:10:45,884 --> 00:10:46,753
Hello, everyone.

274
00:10:46,754 --> 00:10:48,503
Sorry to barge in.

275
00:10:48,504 --> 00:10:50,463
This isn't what I had in
mind for our first meeting,

276
00:10:50,464 --> 00:10:52,043
but right now we're
on a tight deadline.

277
00:10:52,044 --> 00:10:54,383
Everybody know
Secretary of State McCord?

278
00:10:54,384 --> 00:10:55,713
You can all say your hellos later.

279
00:10:55,714 --> 00:10:57,843
CI interrogators are
about to interview a man

280
00:10:57,844 --> 00:11:00,503
who claims to have seen
Jibral Disah since the attack.

281
00:11:00,504 --> 00:11:04,133
This is a live, secure feed
from the Italian naval ship

282
00:11:04,134 --> 00:11:05,148
that plucked him

283
00:11:05,149 --> 00:11:07,198
and 42 other Libyan civilians

284
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:08,818
from a sinking refugee boat last night.

285
00:11:08,819 --> 00:11:13,488
You've got two hours to figure
out if this guy's for real.

286
00:11:13,489 --> 00:11:15,358
After that, the Italians
want their ship back.

287
00:11:15,359 --> 00:11:17,318
Stop for clarifications,

288
00:11:17,319 --> 00:11:18,988
feed the interrogators questions.

289
00:11:18,989 --> 00:11:20,778
That's his file.

290
00:11:20,779 --> 00:11:22,489
Clock's ticking.

291
00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:28,908
HENRY: Other than those two occasions,

292
00:11:28,909 --> 00:11:32,148
were there any other times
he personally saw Jibral Disah?

293
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:36,488
Moussa, did you see Jibral
Disah any other times?

294
00:11:36,489 --> 00:11:38,528
(translating in Arabic)

295
00:11:38,529 --> 00:11:39,529
(speaking Arabic)

296
00:11:46,989 --> 00:11:49,318
Yes. Once they blindfolded me

297
00:11:49,319 --> 00:11:51,948
and took me to the desert
to work on a truck.

298
00:11:51,949 --> 00:11:54,148
That's when I saw
the emir and his wife.

299
00:11:54,149 --> 00:11:56,358
Wait a minute.
He went out to the desert

300
00:11:56,359 --> 00:11:58,528
and saw Jibral Disah
and one of his wives?

301
00:11:58,529 --> 00:12:01,028
Or he's spinning tales to get a visa.

302
00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:03,738
Did they blindfold him
or put a hood on him?

303
00:12:03,739 --> 00:12:05,408
Did they blindfold you

304
00:12:05,409 --> 00:12:06,864
or put a hood on you?

305
00:12:06,865 --> 00:12:08,318
(translates in Arabic)

306
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,149
- (speaks Arabic)
- TRANSLATOR: It was a hood.

307
00:12:10,152 --> 00:12:12,778
What was wrong with the truck?

308
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:14,239
- What was wrong with the truck?
- (translates)

309
00:12:14,242 --> 00:12:16,569
(speaking Arabic)

310
00:12:17,609 --> 00:12:19,608
TRANSLATOR: I worked on the engine.

311
00:12:19,609 --> 00:12:22,358
They overheated it trying
to get out of a ditch.

312
00:12:22,359 --> 00:12:25,148
Did they ask him to do
anything else to the truck?

313
00:12:25,149 --> 00:12:27,278
Was that the only service
you performed?

314
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,358
(translates)

315
00:12:29,359 --> 00:12:31,149
(speaking Arabic)

316
00:12:35,649 --> 00:12:37,778
TRANSLATOR:
I got the clay out of the tires.

317
00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:39,318
They were caked in this red clay.

318
00:12:39,319 --> 00:12:41,278
I had to dig it out for traction.

319
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,278
Look, the other two times
he saw Jibral Disah,

320
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:44,608
it was at a distance.

321
00:12:44,609 --> 00:12:47,908
So question is: how did he
know it was Jibral Disah?

322
00:12:47,909 --> 00:12:49,648
How did you know it was Disah?

323
00:12:49,649 --> 00:12:51,028
(translates)

324
00:12:51,029 --> 00:12:52,448
(speaking Arabic)

325
00:12:52,449 --> 00:12:54,358
TRANSLATOR: His picture was
on the television every day.

326
00:12:54,359 --> 00:12:56,358
It was four days after
the bombing in America.

327
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:58,238
I'm sure it was him.

328
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:02,318
How did he know the woman
with Jibral Disah was his wife?

329
00:13:02,319 --> 00:13:04,537
- How did you know he was with his wife?
- (translates)

330
00:13:04,538 --> 00:13:06,068
(speaking Arabic)

331
00:13:06,069 --> 00:13:07,528
TRANSLATOR: She was wearing a ring.

332
00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:09,108
And he called her "wife."

333
00:13:09,109 --> 00:13:10,948
And I noticed that her hands were red

334
00:13:10,949 --> 00:13:12,528
from the red clay, I think.

335
00:13:12,529 --> 00:13:14,148
She was wearing a niqab, of course,

336
00:13:14,149 --> 00:13:16,529
- so I didn't see her face.
- FELLOWS: CIA's had eyes on both

337
00:13:16,532 --> 00:13:19,408
of Jibral Disah's wives in
Saudi Arabia since the attack.

338
00:13:19,409 --> 00:13:20,698
They haven't left the country.

339
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:22,148
They know we're watching.

340
00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:24,148
They don't want them to lead us to him.

341
00:13:24,149 --> 00:13:26,526
The question is: who is this woman?

342
00:13:26,527 --> 00:13:28,362
You mean the one in the
head-to-toe garbage bag

343
00:13:28,363 --> 00:13:29,945
with a hidden face we can't I.D.?

344
00:13:29,946 --> 00:13:30,698
Guess what,

345
00:13:30,699 --> 00:13:31,818
she's nobody.

346
00:13:31,819 --> 00:13:33,198
Without corroborating evidence,

347
00:13:33,199 --> 00:13:35,908
all we have is Moussa's
word on any of this.

348
00:13:35,909 --> 00:13:37,318
So...

349
00:13:37,319 --> 00:13:39,068
do we think we have anything here?

350
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:42,488
The president needs our answer.

351
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:43,949
You know mine.

352
00:13:52,949 --> 00:13:54,988
So you recommend cutting him loose.

353
00:13:54,989 --> 00:13:56,408
Murphy Station deems his claims,

354
00:13:56,409 --> 00:13:59,006
including that Disah was
traveling with a wife,

355
00:13:59,007 --> 00:14:00,108
not credible.

356
00:14:00,109 --> 00:14:01,778
I'm sorry, sir.

357
00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:04,698
I hoped this would pan out.

358
00:14:04,699 --> 00:14:07,738
So I guess I bawled you
out for nothing, Gordon.

359
00:14:07,739 --> 00:14:09,028
Bess, thank the Italians.

360
00:14:09,029 --> 00:14:10,319
They can take him from here.

361
00:14:12,359 --> 00:14:16,574
You mean ship him and the rest
of the refugees back to Libya?

362
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:19,927
They are Libyan citizens
on an Italian ship.

363
00:14:19,928 --> 00:14:21,068
Sir, are we really

364
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:23,278
going to send them back
to the terrorist haven

365
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,608
they risked their lives to escape?

366
00:14:24,609 --> 00:14:26,778
This is the U.S., not the U.N.

367
00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:29,960
Well, then let's find a UNHCR
camp that'll take them.

368
00:14:29,961 --> 00:14:31,278
Much as I would love to help,

369
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:34,149
these refugees do not fall
under our jurisdiction.

370
00:14:34,989 --> 00:14:36,698
Understood.

371
00:14:36,699 --> 00:14:38,779
I'll make the call, sir.

372
00:14:52,699 --> 00:14:55,698
Jane, when does the Italian
ship dock in Tripoli?

373
00:14:55,699 --> 00:14:57,198
Uh...

374
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:58,608
2200. Why?

375
00:14:58,609 --> 00:15:01,448
Have you read the CIA interview
with this guy Ramzi Shamekh?

376
00:15:01,449 --> 00:15:03,488
Just the highlights, yeah.
He's an old CIA source

377
00:15:03,489 --> 00:15:06,488
who they interviewed post-attack
'cause he's got a cousin in HS.

378
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:08,108
Wasn't much else there though, right?

379
00:15:08,109 --> 00:15:10,028
He says Disah used to
make frequent visits

380
00:15:10,029 --> 00:15:12,778
to the Al Wahat District
before and after the attacks.

381
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:14,970
Well, that's near
our mechanic's village.

382
00:15:14,971 --> 00:15:16,139
- So...
- So look at the map.

383
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:18,988
It's famous for its red clay flats.

384
00:15:18,989 --> 00:15:20,608
There's your corroboration.

385
00:15:20,609 --> 00:15:22,908
Two sources that put Disah in the area

386
00:15:22,909 --> 00:15:24,488
in the days after the bombing.

387
00:15:24,489 --> 00:15:26,318
And one of them's
about to step off a boat

388
00:15:26,319 --> 00:15:27,488
and straight into the enemy's hands.

389
00:15:27,489 --> 00:15:28,818
We have to tell Russell.

390
00:15:28,819 --> 00:15:31,908
We don't have time.
Now, just back me up here.

391
00:15:31,909 --> 00:15:33,189
I'm going straight to Elizabeth.

392
00:15:33,859 --> 00:15:35,859
We've got to stop that ship.

393
00:15:38,552 --> 00:15:45,542
Subtitle sync and corrections by
<b>awaqeded</b> for <b>www.addic7ed.com.</b>

394
00:15:51,636 --> 00:15:53,178
ELIZABETH: <i>The Italians aren't happy,</i>

395
00:15:53,179 --> 00:15:55,841
- but they didn't dock in Tripoli.
- Good.

396
00:15:55,842 --> 00:15:59,257
CIA's reaching out to their
source, this Shamekh guy.

397
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:01,427
We can check his Intel
against Moussa's interview,

398
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:02,587
and that'll be that.

399
00:16:02,588 --> 00:16:04,612
Not quite.

400
00:16:04,806 --> 00:16:06,401
The Italians have a price.

401
00:16:06,402 --> 00:16:07,691
Oh, here we go.

402
00:16:07,692 --> 00:16:09,388
The Libyan refugees.

403
00:16:09,389 --> 00:16:12,731
If we want Moussa, they insist

404
00:16:12,732 --> 00:16:15,311
we take responsibility
for all 243 aboard.

405
00:16:15,312 --> 00:16:18,901
Whoa. Take in refugees from
the country that-that harbored

406
00:16:18,902 --> 00:16:21,561
the mastermind of a
week-old dirty bomb attack?

407
00:16:21,562 --> 00:16:23,652
- Yeah, we're not doing that.
- Why?

408
00:16:23,655 --> 00:16:25,981
POTUS already announced

409
00:16:25,982 --> 00:16:29,269
the U.S. would resettle
20,000 Libyans this year.

410
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:31,651
That was before the bombing,
which is bad enough.

411
00:16:31,652 --> 00:16:33,231
Now the president will be labeled

412
00:16:33,232 --> 00:16:34,691
Aider and Comforter in Chief.

413
00:16:34,692 --> 00:16:35,731
Pitch me something else.

414
00:16:35,732 --> 00:16:38,481
Listen, even if we strike
intelligence gold,

415
00:16:38,482 --> 00:16:41,731
what good will it do if we
return these folks to Tripoli

416
00:16:41,732 --> 00:16:43,561
and they broadcast what they've seen?

417
00:16:43,562 --> 00:16:45,771
We need to keep them under wraps.

418
00:16:45,772 --> 00:16:47,691
So for a few days of quiet,
we buy ourselves

419
00:16:47,692 --> 00:16:49,561
a political problem
that'll dog us all the way

420
00:16:49,562 --> 00:16:50,941
through the election? No, thanks.

421
00:16:50,942 --> 00:16:53,561
What happened to protecting
our way of life, Russell?

422
00:16:53,562 --> 00:16:54,651
What happened to your argument about

423
00:16:54,652 --> 00:16:55,851
losing our strategic advantage?

424
00:16:55,852 --> 00:16:57,089
I mean, how do you propose

425
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:59,609
to just keep the transfer of 243 people

426
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:03,151
from an Italian naval vessel to
an American one out of the news?

427
00:17:03,152 --> 00:17:07,352
Oh, Russell, don't you know me by now?

428
00:17:13,062 --> 00:17:15,151
Joint naval exercises?

429
00:17:15,152 --> 00:17:18,611
Well, you're not really
selling it, but yeah.

430
00:17:18,612 --> 00:17:19,941
If the media asks

431
00:17:19,942 --> 00:17:21,611
why an American cruiser

432
00:17:21,612 --> 00:17:23,811
is docked to an Italian warship,
we say....

433
00:17:23,812 --> 00:17:25,231
"Joint naval exercises."

434
00:17:25,232 --> 00:17:26,771
Better. Matt.

435
00:17:26,772 --> 00:17:27,831
Hmm?

436
00:17:27,832 --> 00:17:30,192
Help the Pentagon craft a
carefully-worded statement

437
00:17:30,193 --> 00:17:32,441
to that effect which
actually reveals nothing.

438
00:17:32,442 --> 00:17:33,412
That's the only kind they write.

439
00:17:33,413 --> 00:17:35,611
Three cheers for the bland
Soviet-style pronouncements,

440
00:17:35,612 --> 00:17:37,061
because I want the media to walk

441
00:17:37,062 --> 00:17:38,580
- right past this, got it?
- Got it.

442
00:17:38,581 --> 00:17:40,351
Okay. And, Nadine, we need to loop in

443
00:17:40,352 --> 00:17:41,881
a tight circle on the Hill.

444
00:17:41,882 --> 00:17:43,271
- Gang of Eight.
- No one else.

445
00:17:43,272 --> 00:17:45,351
And Jay and Blake can
help you with that, okay?

446
00:17:45,352 --> 00:17:46,651
JAY: Wait, what do we tell them,

447
00:17:46,652 --> 00:17:48,691
that State is secretly
doing intake interviews

448
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:49,981
with Libyan refugees
in the Mediterranean?

449
00:17:49,982 --> 00:17:51,771
In order to keep information

450
00:17:51,772 --> 00:17:54,731
out of the hands of terrorists, yes.

451
00:17:54,732 --> 00:17:56,561
And if the senators raise
certain concerns?

452
00:17:56,562 --> 00:17:58,191
About finding Jibral Disah?

453
00:17:58,192 --> 00:18:00,021
NADINE: I believe what
Blake is referring to

454
00:18:00,022 --> 00:18:02,851
is transferring Libyans
to a border camp so soon

455
00:18:02,852 --> 00:18:04,191
after the attack.

456
00:18:04,192 --> 00:18:05,771
Okay, so remind them

457
00:18:05,772 --> 00:18:07,691
that the asylum vetting process

458
00:18:07,692 --> 00:18:10,611
is so thorough that it takes
a minimum of two years.

459
00:18:10,612 --> 00:18:11,901
Hell, remind them

460
00:18:11,903 --> 00:18:13,481
what the plaque on the
Statue of Liberty says.

461
00:18:13,482 --> 00:18:16,061
But only if they get
shirty with you, okay?

462
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:16,897
Yes, ma'am.

463
00:18:16,898 --> 00:18:18,859
All right. I want this
sewn up by end of day.

464
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,941
And if anyone comes sniffing around,

465
00:18:20,942 --> 00:18:22,561
asking what we're up to, we say...

466
00:18:22,562 --> 00:18:25,562
- ALL: "Joint naval exercises."
- There we go.

467
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:28,100
Hey.

468
00:18:28,562 --> 00:18:31,271
The CIA's informant, Shamekh,

469
00:18:31,272 --> 00:18:33,691
says he's got significant
Intel on Jibral Disah

470
00:18:33,692 --> 00:18:35,311
that we're gonna want to hear.

471
00:18:35,312 --> 00:18:37,191
And how much will that cost us?

472
00:18:37,192 --> 00:18:38,981
Five million. Cash.

473
00:18:38,982 --> 00:18:41,191
And he won't talk without
a face-to-face handoff

474
00:18:41,192 --> 00:18:43,061
at a secured location in Libya.

475
00:18:43,062 --> 00:18:44,851
How do we know he's not
working for the bad guys?

476
00:18:44,852 --> 00:18:46,111
Could be a setup.

477
00:18:46,112 --> 00:18:47,441
That's your call.

478
00:18:47,442 --> 00:18:50,652
One of you would do the
interrogation, in Libya.

479
00:18:51,942 --> 00:18:53,561
Shamekh wants to meet tomorrow,

480
00:18:53,562 --> 00:18:55,112
so you don't have much time to decide.

481
00:18:59,563 --> 00:19:02,151
Shamekh gets his info from
his radical terrorist cousin.

482
00:19:02,152 --> 00:19:05,111
My guess is, blood ain't
the only thing they share.

483
00:19:05,112 --> 00:19:07,521
He does describe himself
as a true believer.

484
00:19:07,522 --> 00:19:08,941
I have analyzed his interviews

485
00:19:08,942 --> 00:19:10,611
with the CIA closely,

486
00:19:10,612 --> 00:19:12,901
and he reads the Qur'an metaphorically.

487
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:15,401
He views the Hadiths in context.

488
00:19:15,402 --> 00:19:17,061
Yeah, he's devout,

489
00:19:17,062 --> 00:19:20,151
but I don't get
Salifist jihadist from him.

490
00:19:20,152 --> 00:19:21,771
Well, I'm sold.

491
00:19:21,772 --> 00:19:23,231
He's practically Episcopalian.

492
00:19:23,232 --> 00:19:24,611
Let's cut the check.

493
00:19:24,612 --> 00:19:26,521
A true fundamentalist wouldn't
even hint at such beliefs.

494
00:19:26,522 --> 00:19:27,691
He'd be an apostate.

495
00:19:27,692 --> 00:19:28,981
Maybe he's playing us for the money.

496
00:19:28,982 --> 00:19:30,731
I mean, this whole thing
could be a shakedown.

497
00:19:30,732 --> 00:19:32,401
Whatever it is, it stinks
and the timeline's too short,

498
00:19:32,402 --> 00:19:33,401
and we should keep walking.

499
00:19:33,402 --> 00:19:35,191
I need a decision.

500
00:19:35,192 --> 00:19:36,561
I guess the question is:

501
00:19:36,562 --> 00:19:38,562
is how confident are you
in your assessment, Henry?

502
00:19:42,942 --> 00:19:45,981
Look, I can't predict
what this guy's gonna do,

503
00:19:45,982 --> 00:19:48,561
but from where I sit...

504
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,612
he's a survivor, he's not a radical.

505
00:19:51,772 --> 00:19:52,772
I agree.

506
00:19:55,902 --> 00:19:58,441
Yeah. Me, too.

507
00:19:58,442 --> 00:20:00,111
Okay, then. Let's go for it.

508
00:20:00,112 --> 00:20:01,941
I'll take it to POTUS.

509
00:20:01,942 --> 00:20:05,231
In the meantime, Mimi, you're up.

510
00:20:05,233 --> 00:20:07,693
Let's put those famous
interrogation skills to work.

511
00:20:09,522 --> 00:20:11,692
I guess I got some packing to do.

512
00:20:14,482 --> 00:20:16,652
(quietly): You better hope
you're right, Professor.

513
00:20:22,902 --> 00:20:24,901
So the kids got the PG version...

514
00:20:24,902 --> 00:20:26,231
(sniffs)

515
00:20:26,232 --> 00:20:28,351
...of dad's first day.

516
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,352
What's really up?

517
00:20:34,562 --> 00:20:36,941
We can actually talk now.

518
00:20:36,942 --> 00:20:39,691
I know that Conrad approved

519
00:20:39,692 --> 00:20:41,691
the meet with Shamekh for tomorrow.

520
00:20:41,692 --> 00:20:44,231
The CIA's improvising a safe house

521
00:20:44,232 --> 00:20:46,191
in a country overrun by terrorists.

522
00:20:46,192 --> 00:20:48,151
Mimi's on a plane as we speak.

523
00:20:48,152 --> 00:20:50,441
It spooks me how quickly we're moving.

524
00:20:50,442 --> 00:20:53,901
Hey, the government could take
months to send a tax refund;

525
00:20:53,902 --> 00:20:57,691
when it comes to spy stuff,
we move fast.

526
00:20:57,692 --> 00:20:58,691
(chuckles)

527
00:20:58,692 --> 00:21:01,272
STEVIE: Okay. I will see you there.

528
00:21:03,352 --> 00:21:07,021
Okay. So, just to put your mind
at ease about my social life,

529
00:21:07,023 --> 00:21:08,691
guess who's coming to dinner tomorrow?

530
00:21:08,692 --> 00:21:09,651
Jared?

531
00:21:09,652 --> 00:21:11,651
<i>Jareth.</i> Like the David Bowie movie.

532
00:21:11,652 --> 00:21:12,811
You guys, you have to get

533
00:21:12,812 --> 00:21:14,691
all this stuff out of your system now.

534
00:21:14,692 --> 00:21:16,271
You can't embarrass me with him.

535
00:21:16,272 --> 00:21:17,441
Oh, I think we can.

536
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:18,982
- Like falling off a log.
- Seriously.

537
00:21:18,985 --> 00:21:20,061
I like him.

538
00:21:20,062 --> 00:21:21,561
Plus, he's British,

539
00:21:21,562 --> 00:21:23,651
so he might not even get
your sense of humor.

540
00:21:23,652 --> 00:21:25,481
I heard we're huge in the U.K.

541
00:21:25,482 --> 00:21:27,651
(British accent):
We will be proper citizens.

542
00:21:27,652 --> 00:21:28,652
- (chuckles)
- Oh, my...

543
00:21:28,655 --> 00:21:29,382
Should I cook?

544
00:21:29,383 --> 00:21:30,111
Um...

545
00:21:30,112 --> 00:21:31,441
Of course not. What should we order?

546
00:21:31,442 --> 00:21:33,901
I'll cook.
You just show up and be cool.

547
00:21:33,902 --> 00:21:35,441
We can do that, I swear.

548
00:21:35,442 --> 00:21:37,442
Okay. Good night.

549
00:21:39,482 --> 00:21:41,981
God, it'll be nice to
do something normal.

550
00:21:41,982 --> 00:21:43,981
I wonder how old he is.

551
00:21:43,982 --> 00:21:45,311
We like him.

552
00:21:45,312 --> 00:21:47,312
Got it.

553
00:21:50,522 --> 00:21:52,611
(elevator bell dings)

554
00:21:52,612 --> 00:21:53,771
Uh-oh.

555
00:21:53,772 --> 00:21:55,351
Anxious Daisy face.

556
00:21:55,352 --> 00:21:57,271
So, I swatted back most reporters,

557
00:21:57,272 --> 00:21:59,191
but one called his senator for comment.

558
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:02,271
That senator would be
Carlos Morejon from Arizona.

559
00:22:02,273 --> 00:22:03,731
It's not a good thing.

560
00:22:03,732 --> 00:22:06,811
He ran on a strict
anti-immigration platform.

561
00:22:06,812 --> 00:22:08,151
His slogan was...

562
00:22:08,152 --> 00:22:10,561
Yes, yes, I remember.

563
00:22:10,562 --> 00:22:14,651
"Keep Arizona secure
for the Arizonans."

564
00:22:14,652 --> 00:22:15,851
That's it.

565
00:22:15,852 --> 00:22:18,151
Really just rolls right off your tongue.

566
00:22:18,152 --> 00:22:20,151
Well, he sniffed around,

567
00:22:20,152 --> 00:22:22,311
found out about the Libyan refugees.

568
00:22:22,312 --> 00:22:24,611
He's holding a press conference
to denounce the plan tonight.

569
00:22:24,612 --> 00:22:26,431
Right before the Shamekh meet.

570
00:22:26,432 --> 00:22:27,334
He's gonna blow it up.

571
00:22:27,335 --> 00:22:29,561
And risk the lives of
ten intelligence agents

572
00:22:29,562 --> 00:22:30,981
in the process.

573
00:22:30,983 --> 00:22:33,853
Nadine, will you get me Senator
Morejon right away, please.

574
00:22:42,696 --> 00:22:43,616
(door opens, closes)

575
00:22:43,617 --> 00:22:45,451
Senator Morejon.

576
00:22:45,452 --> 00:22:46,242
Welcome.

577
00:22:46,243 --> 00:22:47,030
The inner sanctum.

578
00:22:47,031 --> 00:22:48,780
(chuckles) Please, have a seat.

579
00:22:49,575 --> 00:22:51,981
Oh, you know, I've tried
to get meetings before,

580
00:22:51,982 --> 00:22:53,561
but you're always booked.

581
00:22:53,562 --> 00:22:55,811
But it looks like I have
your attention now.

582
00:22:55,812 --> 00:22:57,181
Unfortunately, it has to be short.

583
00:22:57,182 --> 00:22:58,260
I have a press conference.

584
00:22:58,261 --> 00:22:59,639
Call it off, Senator.

585
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:03,311
It's a matter of national security.

586
00:23:03,312 --> 00:23:04,394
And the matter is?

587
00:23:04,395 --> 00:23:05,382
Classified.

588
00:23:05,383 --> 00:23:07,999
But American lives are at stake.

589
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,038
Oh, yes, because of this
reckless and secretive plan

590
00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:11,781
that you've cooked up
to bring a boatload

591
00:23:11,782 --> 00:23:13,431
of potential terrorists to our shores.

592
00:23:13,432 --> 00:23:16,596
Senator, you know as well as I

593
00:23:16,597 --> 00:23:18,795
that only a fraction of the one percent

594
00:23:18,796 --> 00:23:22,005
of the nearly one million
refugees admitted to the U.S.

595
00:23:22,007 --> 00:23:26,386
since 9/11 have ever been
arrested on terrorism charges.

596
00:23:26,387 --> 00:23:28,556
It only takes one.

597
00:23:28,557 --> 00:23:29,966
Look at the dirty bomb.

598
00:23:29,967 --> 00:23:33,386
Which was perpetrated by
a native-born American citizen.

599
00:23:33,387 --> 00:23:35,506
Good folks in my state
know the difference

600
00:23:35,507 --> 00:23:38,466
between native-born and real,
and I'm wondering

601
00:23:38,467 --> 00:23:39,847
if you do.

602
00:23:41,847 --> 00:23:44,926
Morejon... that's a Cuban name, right?

603
00:23:44,927 --> 00:23:47,096
When did your parents
arrive in the U.S.?

604
00:23:47,097 --> 00:23:49,096
I'm guessing that you
know the answer to that.

605
00:23:49,097 --> 00:23:51,556
Of course I do;
I'm the Secretary of State.

606
00:23:51,557 --> 00:23:54,556
They were Marielitos,
part of the boatlift of 1980.

607
00:23:54,557 --> 00:23:56,556
They were fleeing a repressive regime.

608
00:23:56,557 --> 00:23:59,636
Which is why the good folks in
these parts gave them visas...

609
00:23:59,637 --> 00:24:01,596
That you and your president
have cravenly cozied up to.

610
00:24:01,597 --> 00:24:03,676
...instead of smearing
them as potential

611
00:24:03,677 --> 00:24:07,557
Communist sleeper agents
sent to destroy our way of life.

612
00:24:08,637 --> 00:24:11,676
But, hell, your boat made it here...

613
00:24:11,677 --> 00:24:13,257
what do you care, right?

614
00:24:15,507 --> 00:24:17,756
You should watch my press conference.

615
00:24:17,757 --> 00:24:19,466
I have a lot to say about you.

616
00:24:19,467 --> 00:24:21,136
You have a good day, Madam Secretary.

617
00:24:21,137 --> 00:24:23,466
My children were at that blast,
and my husband

618
00:24:23,467 --> 00:24:25,256
suffered radiation poisoning.

619
00:24:25,257 --> 00:24:27,596
Where were you that day?

620
00:24:27,597 --> 00:24:30,636
At a fund-raiser in Phoenix.

621
00:24:30,637 --> 00:24:33,387
So cut the bluster and sit down.
I'm gonna read you in.

622
00:24:38,597 --> 00:24:40,466
One second.

623
00:24:40,467 --> 00:24:43,216
TECHOPS is having trouble with the line.

624
00:24:43,217 --> 00:24:45,006
<i>Marhaba!</i>

625
00:24:45,007 --> 00:24:46,506
Greetings from Libya.

626
00:24:46,507 --> 00:24:47,926
Mimi, good to see you.

627
00:24:47,927 --> 00:24:49,296
How are things looking over there?

628
00:24:49,297 --> 00:24:50,716
Our perimeter is secure.

629
00:24:50,717 --> 00:24:53,096
ISR drones on all roads in and out.

630
00:24:53,097 --> 00:24:55,176
Our side of the equation's tight.

631
00:24:55,177 --> 00:24:56,466
Any word from Shamekh?

632
00:24:56,467 --> 00:24:57,796
He's en route.

633
00:24:57,797 --> 00:24:59,886
We just have to cool our
heels till he gets here.

634
00:24:59,887 --> 00:25:01,676
Russell,

635
00:25:01,677 --> 00:25:03,596
I got to say...

636
00:25:03,597 --> 00:25:06,426
your ability to gather
five million in 24 hours...

637
00:25:06,427 --> 00:25:08,596
remember that when I ask for a raise.

638
00:25:08,597 --> 00:25:10,506
(chuckles)
After this, you'll deserve one.

639
00:25:10,507 --> 00:25:12,096
We'll see you in a bit.

640
00:25:12,097 --> 00:25:13,097
Yep.

641
00:25:21,507 --> 00:25:23,636
Well, it's press conference o'clock.

642
00:25:23,637 --> 00:25:26,096
Daisy says Morejon's
office is quiet for now.

643
00:25:26,097 --> 00:25:28,297
- Keep her on him through the whole meet.
- (phone vibrating)

644
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:31,136
If he goes near a camera, she's
ordered to pull a fire alarm.

645
00:25:31,137 --> 00:25:33,056
It's Stevie.

646
00:25:33,057 --> 00:25:35,136
Hey, honey, what's up?
I'm just rushing into a meeting.

647
00:25:35,137 --> 00:25:37,097
Now? Jareth's arriving any minute.

648
00:25:38,507 --> 00:25:40,346
That was tonight?

649
00:25:40,347 --> 00:25:41,596
You forgot?

650
00:25:41,597 --> 00:25:43,256
(sighs) I was preoccupied with work

651
00:25:43,257 --> 00:25:44,676
and I forget to tell Blake.

652
00:25:44,677 --> 00:25:46,096
Forget to tell Blake what?

653
00:25:46,097 --> 00:25:47,926
Seriously, you're not coming?

654
00:25:47,927 --> 00:25:50,556
There is a lot going on
here today. Baby, I'm sorry.

655
00:25:50,557 --> 00:25:51,717
What about Dad?

656
00:25:53,097 --> 00:25:54,966
He's working, too.

657
00:25:54,967 --> 00:25:56,596
It's special circumstances.

658
00:25:56,597 --> 00:25:57,636
I'm so sorry.

659
00:25:57,637 --> 00:25:59,676
It's okay. I'm sure it's important.

660
00:25:59,677 --> 00:26:00,676
Let's reschedule.

661
00:26:00,677 --> 00:26:02,346
I really want to meet him.

662
00:26:02,347 --> 00:26:03,926
I promise I'll be cool.

663
00:26:03,927 --> 00:26:05,676
And show up?

664
00:26:05,677 --> 00:26:06,966
Okay, you get to have that.

665
00:26:06,967 --> 00:26:07,966
(doorbell rings)

666
00:26:07,967 --> 00:26:09,466
That's him. I got to go.

667
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:11,467
Okay, have fun. I love you.

668
00:26:20,717 --> 00:26:22,506
Now, don't get too excited.

669
00:26:22,507 --> 00:26:23,926
These are for your mum.

670
00:26:23,927 --> 00:26:26,556
Oh, very strategic.

671
00:26:26,557 --> 00:26:29,136
I hail from the land of common sense.

672
00:26:29,137 --> 00:26:31,596
(chuckles)

673
00:26:31,597 --> 00:26:32,676
Right.

674
00:26:32,677 --> 00:26:34,796
So, slight change of plan.

675
00:26:34,797 --> 00:26:36,757
Um, as it turns out...

676
00:26:38,677 --> 00:26:39,756
Mr. President.

677
00:26:39,757 --> 00:26:41,557
Bess.

678
00:26:44,057 --> 00:26:47,056
(quietly): Did you remember
the Jareth dinner tonight?

679
00:26:47,057 --> 00:26:48,716
That was tonight?

680
00:26:48,717 --> 00:26:49,697
That's what I said.

681
00:26:49,698 --> 00:26:50,676
(sighs)

682
00:26:50,677 --> 00:26:53,256
Director Ware, we have eyes
on a vehicle approaching.

683
00:26:53,257 --> 00:26:54,756
Copy, Babylon.

684
00:26:54,757 --> 00:26:56,596
Can you get a positive I.D.?

685
00:26:56,597 --> 00:26:58,006
Copy.

686
00:26:58,007 --> 00:26:59,387
Confirming.

687
00:27:06,757 --> 00:27:08,596
It's Shamekh's jeep,

688
00:27:08,597 --> 00:27:11,096
approaching from the north as planned.

689
00:27:11,097 --> 00:27:12,346
Are we sure Shamekh's driving?

690
00:27:12,347 --> 00:27:14,216
Not yet. We'll confirm
at the checkpoint.

691
00:27:14,217 --> 00:27:16,506
What happens after
the initial approach?

692
00:27:16,507 --> 00:27:18,886
Once we I.D. Shamekh,
one of our guys will direct him

693
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,796
to a designated parking area.

694
00:27:20,797 --> 00:27:24,637
Then Agent Jacobs escorts him in
and begins the interrogation.

695
00:27:30,467 --> 00:27:32,466
I.D. confirmed.

696
00:27:32,467 --> 00:27:33,677
It's Shamekh.

697
00:27:34,847 --> 00:27:36,846
We've told him to park at the wall,

698
00:27:36,847 --> 00:27:38,597
a safe distance from the house.

699
00:27:43,467 --> 00:27:46,507
♪ ♪

700
00:28:12,347 --> 00:28:14,506
Slowly.

701
00:28:14,507 --> 00:28:16,507
(speaking Arabic)

702
00:28:23,967 --> 00:28:25,427
- (men shouting)
- Get him out of there.

703
00:28:25,428 --> 00:28:26,136
Quick Reaction Force, engage.

704
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:28,177
(shouts in Arabic)

705
00:28:29,217 --> 00:28:30,796
EXFIL operators.

706
00:28:31,696 --> 00:28:33,257
Babylon, talk to me.

707
00:28:33,783 --> 00:28:36,097
Babylon, are you hit?

708
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:39,257
(all murmuring)

709
00:29:02,007 --> 00:29:03,587
(sighs)

710
00:29:13,304 --> 00:29:14,614
What went wrong?

711
00:29:15,424 --> 00:29:18,132
Nothing about Shamekh
presents as Jihadi.

712
00:29:18,264 --> 00:29:20,423
Somehow they played us.

713
00:29:20,424 --> 00:29:23,173
Because that's what they do.

714
00:29:23,174 --> 00:29:26,513
They sit around and think about
how to kill people all day long.

715
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:28,302
Something happened, I'm telling you.

716
00:29:28,303 --> 00:29:30,343
The guy is not a martyr.
He's in it for the money.

717
00:29:30,344 --> 00:29:35,343
CIA and DNI will comb the scene,
evaluate security breaches.

718
00:29:35,344 --> 00:29:38,939
Forensics will gather any
bomb fragments for analysis.

719
00:29:39,175 --> 00:29:41,133
It wasn't your fault, babe.

720
00:29:41,134 --> 00:29:44,963
She had kids, you know... Mimi.

721
00:29:44,964 --> 00:29:46,964
I know.

722
00:29:51,924 --> 00:29:53,049
AUTOMATED VOICE: Well done!

723
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:54,174
(lasers firing)

724
00:30:01,344 --> 00:30:02,513
(chuckles softly)

725
00:30:02,514 --> 00:30:03,723
Oh.

726
00:30:03,724 --> 00:30:05,673
Alison just texted.

727
00:30:05,674 --> 00:30:08,013
She is stuck

728
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:10,223
at a friend's house
studying for midterms,

729
00:30:10,224 --> 00:30:12,223
so more for us.

730
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:14,383
I actually prefer eating in bulk.

731
00:30:14,384 --> 00:30:15,513
Makes me feel American.

732
00:30:15,514 --> 00:30:16,383
What is that?

733
00:30:16,384 --> 00:30:18,133
Caramelized onion risotto.

734
00:30:18,134 --> 00:30:19,724
- Looks like hospital food.
- JARETH: As it turns out,

735
00:30:19,727 --> 00:30:21,723
I love hospital food.

736
00:30:21,724 --> 00:30:23,423
If it looks like that,
which it doesn't.

737
00:30:23,424 --> 00:30:25,423
I might've overcooked it.

738
00:30:25,424 --> 00:30:27,803
Seriously, stuff they gave Dad...
exact same color.

739
00:30:27,804 --> 00:30:29,207
Your dad was in hospital?

740
00:30:29,208 --> 00:30:30,223
Not really.

741
00:30:30,224 --> 00:30:31,199
Last week.

742
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,173
He was in and out.

743
00:30:32,174 --> 00:30:35,173
I hope you like garlic,
because this is loaded.

744
00:30:35,174 --> 00:30:37,361
"In and out"?
He was in critical condition.

745
00:30:37,362 --> 00:30:39,203
Jason, if you're just
gonna make fun of my food,

746
00:30:39,204 --> 00:30:40,187
you can leave the table.

747
00:30:40,188 --> 00:30:42,303
I'm not talking about your food
anymore; I'm talking about Dad.

748
00:30:42,304 --> 00:30:44,264
- Know what? That's it. You're done.
- What?

749
00:30:44,267 --> 00:30:45,553
What's your problem?!

750
00:30:45,554 --> 00:30:47,173
Nothing!

751
00:30:47,174 --> 00:30:48,923
(dishes clattering)

752
00:30:48,924 --> 00:30:50,554
Get out while you can, dude.

753
00:31:04,304 --> 00:31:05,553
Okay.

754
00:31:05,554 --> 00:31:08,013
What's going on?

755
00:31:08,014 --> 00:31:11,133
(sniffles) I just really
wanted tonight to be nice.

756
00:31:11,134 --> 00:31:14,133
And my parents couldn't be here.

757
00:31:14,134 --> 00:31:15,223
Which is understandable.

758
00:31:15,224 --> 00:31:16,463
My brother's being a jerk.

759
00:31:16,464 --> 00:31:17,843
He's being fine.

760
00:31:17,844 --> 00:31:20,053
And I messed up the risotto.

761
00:31:20,054 --> 00:31:22,263
Yeah, that's true, but...

762
00:31:22,264 --> 00:31:24,264
that doesn't explain it.

763
00:31:26,764 --> 00:31:28,384
Tell me.

764
00:31:36,634 --> 00:31:39,423
Your dad... he's sick?

765
00:31:39,424 --> 00:31:41,424
Is that it?

766
00:31:43,424 --> 00:31:45,344
Uh, no, he's fine now.

767
00:31:50,764 --> 00:31:53,674
He had, um... he had
radiation poisoning.

768
00:31:55,304 --> 00:31:57,264
He was at the bomb blast?

769
00:31:58,724 --> 00:32:00,383
Yeah.

770
00:32:00,384 --> 00:32:03,883
So was Jason and Alison.

771
00:32:03,884 --> 00:32:06,464
So was I.

772
00:32:08,304 --> 00:32:09,844
Why didn't you tell me?

773
00:32:12,514 --> 00:32:16,423
The truth is, I...

774
00:32:16,424 --> 00:32:17,883
I don't know.

775
00:32:17,884 --> 00:32:21,093
As long as I was worrying about
how everyone else was feeling,

776
00:32:21,094 --> 00:32:23,963
I didn't... I didn't have to
think about how I was feeling.

777
00:32:23,964 --> 00:32:25,964
And it's just hitting me all at once.

778
00:32:27,764 --> 00:32:30,633
And part of me...

779
00:32:30,634 --> 00:32:32,513
thinks if I don't talk about it,

780
00:32:32,514 --> 00:32:34,883
then I don't have to deal with it.

781
00:32:34,884 --> 00:32:38,553
Which I've had enough
psychology to know isn't true.

782
00:32:38,554 --> 00:32:40,303
I'll probably just develop, uh,

783
00:32:40,304 --> 00:32:42,303
a tic or a skin condition or something.

784
00:32:42,304 --> 00:32:44,593
Serious drug habit.

785
00:32:44,594 --> 00:32:46,383
Can't rule out kleptomania.

786
00:32:46,384 --> 00:32:47,763
(laughs)

787
00:32:47,764 --> 00:32:49,883
Ah, see.

788
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:51,513
That is the problem.

789
00:32:51,514 --> 00:32:53,923
You're fun.

790
00:32:53,924 --> 00:32:55,513
We're fun and...

791
00:32:55,514 --> 00:32:57,134
Yeah.

792
00:32:59,964 --> 00:33:03,161
This thing that happened
to me is just so not fun.

793
00:33:05,724 --> 00:33:08,263
It's just, all of a
sudden, everything is...

794
00:33:08,264 --> 00:33:10,133
it's dark and serious because of me.

795
00:33:10,134 --> 00:33:13,133
No. No.

796
00:33:13,134 --> 00:33:15,263
Because of some lunatic with a bomb.

797
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:17,514
Will be fun again, I promise.

798
00:33:19,924 --> 00:33:23,093
I mean, maybe not with me,
but someone will come along.

799
00:33:23,094 --> 00:33:25,263
(laughs)

800
00:33:25,264 --> 00:33:27,963
DAISY: This girl was forced
to marry an HS fighter

801
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:29,673
who raped her every
night until she escaped

802
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,013
with her newborn daughter.

803
00:33:31,014 --> 00:33:32,723
BLAKE: Then she handed
over all her money

804
00:33:32,724 --> 00:33:36,633
and climbed onto some criminal's
leaky boat with her child.

805
00:33:36,634 --> 00:33:37,803
Just to get away.

806
00:33:37,804 --> 00:33:39,553
Each one of these files is a life.

807
00:33:39,554 --> 00:33:41,355
And this is just one boat.

808
00:33:41,356 --> 00:33:43,553
And yet, almost every one of them says

809
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:46,223
that if it were possible,
they'd stay in Libya.

810
00:33:46,224 --> 00:33:47,134
It's home.

811
00:33:48,384 --> 00:33:49,673
(Elizabeth sighs)

812
00:33:49,674 --> 00:33:50,803
Sit. Sit.

813
00:33:50,804 --> 00:33:53,093
We were sorry to hear about

814
00:33:53,094 --> 00:33:54,223
the op in Libya.

815
00:33:54,224 --> 00:33:55,633
You have our condolences.

816
00:33:55,634 --> 00:33:59,383
It wasn't the outcome
anyone had hoped for.

817
00:33:59,384 --> 00:34:01,263
But we still have work.

818
00:34:01,264 --> 00:34:04,263
Now we can transfer the
refugees off our ship

819
00:34:04,264 --> 00:34:06,843
into Camp Blickstein in New
Mexico for processing.

820
00:34:06,844 --> 00:34:08,263
(sighs)

821
00:34:08,264 --> 00:34:09,463
After everything they've been through,

822
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:11,843
these people deserve some stability.

823
00:34:11,844 --> 00:34:14,723
Unfortunately, starting
interdepartmental vetting

824
00:34:14,724 --> 00:34:16,593
opens them to scrutiny.

825
00:34:16,594 --> 00:34:18,303
JAY: And you can believe Senator Morejon

826
00:34:18,304 --> 00:34:19,287
will stoke the flames.

827
00:34:19,288 --> 00:34:21,423
Well, even if he passed
a bill to block them,

828
00:34:21,424 --> 00:34:22,423
Dalton would veto it.

829
00:34:22,424 --> 00:34:23,963
So we are full steam ahead.

830
00:34:23,964 --> 00:34:25,263
Nadine, make this a priority.

831
00:34:25,264 --> 00:34:26,815
- Yeah.
- These people matter,

832
00:34:26,816 --> 00:34:29,304
and they're not going back.

833
00:34:34,764 --> 00:34:37,303
(shouting, explosion over computer)

834
00:34:37,304 --> 00:34:38,963
Hey.

835
00:34:38,964 --> 00:34:41,343
Hey.

836
00:34:41,344 --> 00:34:43,093
(shouting, explosion
over computer repeats)

837
00:34:43,094 --> 00:34:45,133
Everybody's asleep.

838
00:34:45,134 --> 00:34:47,303
Any word on the Jareth dinner?

839
00:34:47,304 --> 00:34:48,303
No.

840
00:34:48,304 --> 00:34:50,343
How about you?

841
00:34:50,344 --> 00:34:51,763
I'm not tired.

842
00:34:51,764 --> 00:34:54,343
Henry, you're obsessing.

843
00:34:54,344 --> 00:34:55,963
You got to put it down

844
00:34:55,964 --> 00:34:57,263
for the night.

845
00:34:57,264 --> 00:34:59,923
(sighs)

846
00:34:59,924 --> 00:35:01,883
I've gone over Shamekh's files.

847
00:35:01,884 --> 00:35:06,593
I've thought about
this from every angle.

848
00:35:06,594 --> 00:35:09,463
And still, given everything,
I would make the same call.

849
00:35:09,464 --> 00:35:11,094
So what are you doing?

850
00:35:13,224 --> 00:35:15,383
Looking.

851
00:35:15,384 --> 00:35:17,133
For what we missed, I guess.

852
00:35:17,134 --> 00:35:19,633
(phone ringing)

853
00:35:19,634 --> 00:35:20,633
Hi, Russell.

854
00:35:20,634 --> 00:35:21,633
Any news?

855
00:35:21,634 --> 00:35:22,723
Are you with Elizabeth?

856
00:35:22,724 --> 00:35:23,739
Yeah, she's right here.

857
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:24,633
Good.

858
00:35:24,634 --> 00:35:26,513
She'll want to hear this.

859
00:35:26,514 --> 00:35:28,343
Got something.

860
00:35:28,344 --> 00:35:29,052
(phone beeps)

861
00:35:29,053 --> 00:35:32,343
Forensics pieced
together Shamekh's vest.

862
00:35:32,344 --> 00:35:33,963
It was remotely detonated.

863
00:35:33,964 --> 00:35:37,133
Looks like they didn't trust him
to go through with the bombing.

864
00:35:37,134 --> 00:35:39,303
So he wasn't radicalized,
he was coerced.

865
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:41,423
HS must have made him.

866
00:35:41,424 --> 00:35:43,463
They're still examining
the various recordings,

867
00:35:43,464 --> 00:35:45,223
trying to get a fuller picture,

868
00:35:45,224 --> 00:35:48,343
but I wanted you to know.

869
00:35:48,344 --> 00:35:50,303
Okay, thanks. I'll see you tomorrow.

870
00:35:50,304 --> 00:35:51,383
(phone beeps)

871
00:35:51,384 --> 00:35:53,673
They must have threatened his family.

872
00:35:53,674 --> 00:35:55,957
It was his only way out.

873
00:35:57,514 --> 00:35:58,853
(sighs)

874
00:36:00,304 --> 00:36:02,038
You heard him, babe.

875
00:36:03,134 --> 00:36:04,898
It's not on you.

876
00:36:05,924 --> 00:36:07,303
Yeah.

877
00:36:07,304 --> 00:36:08,513
Come on.

878
00:36:08,514 --> 00:36:10,779
Let's go to bed, okay?

879
00:36:11,804 --> 00:36:12,883
(groans)

880
00:36:12,884 --> 00:36:15,464
Uh... I'll be right up.

881
00:36:22,264 --> 00:36:24,264
(shouting, explosion
over computer repeats)

882
00:36:29,054 --> 00:36:31,054
(shouting, explosion
over computer repeats)

883
00:36:38,824 --> 00:36:40,703
Morning, everybody.

884
00:36:40,704 --> 00:36:42,533
How's it going?

885
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:44,323
Chemistry midterm?

886
00:36:44,324 --> 00:36:46,572
Ugh, my brain is turning to mush.

887
00:36:46,573 --> 00:36:47,363
(chuckles)

888
00:36:47,364 --> 00:36:50,212
I believe the term is
"catalytic conversion."

889
00:36:50,213 --> 00:36:51,882
Not for her. It's called stasis.

890
00:36:51,883 --> 00:36:54,284
And look at that.
Everything's back to normal.

891
00:36:54,285 --> 00:36:56,454
These two are bickering,
this one's not speaking to us.

892
00:36:56,455 --> 00:36:58,034
Well, she has a point.

893
00:36:58,035 --> 00:36:59,374
No, I'm not mad at you guys.

894
00:36:59,375 --> 00:37:00,790
I'm too busy beating myself up.

895
00:37:00,791 --> 00:37:02,204
For what?

896
00:37:02,205 --> 00:37:03,863
Cooking a bowl of slop
and acting like a freak?

897
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:04,415
Jason.

898
00:37:04,418 --> 00:37:05,375
He's right.

899
00:37:05,376 --> 00:37:06,335
I'm sure you didn't.

900
00:37:09,835 --> 00:37:12,834
You know what, tell him it was
our fault and invite him back,

901
00:37:12,835 --> 00:37:13,954
and we'll order in.

902
00:37:13,955 --> 00:37:15,284
Everybody wins.

903
00:37:15,285 --> 00:37:17,414
I don't think we have to
worry about that happening.

904
00:37:17,415 --> 00:37:19,283
If he's smart, he's long gone.

905
00:37:19,284 --> 00:37:20,653
Dad, can you drive me to school?

906
00:37:20,654 --> 00:37:22,205
- I need to study in the car.
- Sure.

907
00:37:22,208 --> 00:37:23,874
(phone ringing)

908
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:26,374
Hello.

909
00:37:26,375 --> 00:37:27,534
Okay.

910
00:37:27,535 --> 00:37:30,034
Yeah, send him in.
I think he knows the way.

911
00:37:30,035 --> 00:37:31,414
Well, he can't be that smart.

912
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:32,414
(mouthing)

913
00:37:32,415 --> 00:37:34,415
What?

914
00:37:37,555 --> 00:37:38,753
Good morning.

915
00:37:39,202 --> 00:37:41,874
I come bearing delicacies
of my homeland.

916
00:37:41,875 --> 00:37:43,704
Oh, God, I hope you mean scones.

917
00:37:43,705 --> 00:37:45,244
Well, it's not bangers and mash.

918
00:37:45,245 --> 00:37:46,244
(laughs)

919
00:37:46,245 --> 00:37:48,124
Madam Secretary, hi.

920
00:37:48,125 --> 00:37:49,704
Dr. McCord, pleasure.

921
00:37:49,705 --> 00:37:51,284
I'm Jareth, like the David Bowie movie.

922
00:37:51,285 --> 00:37:52,744
Nice.

923
00:37:52,745 --> 00:37:54,074
Very nice to meet you.

924
00:37:54,075 --> 00:37:55,124
Welcome back.

925
00:37:55,125 --> 00:37:56,994
Uh, Jason I've met.

926
00:37:56,995 --> 00:37:57,994
You must be Alison.

927
00:37:57,995 --> 00:37:58,725
Hi.

928
00:37:58,726 --> 00:37:59,454
Hi.

929
00:37:59,455 --> 00:38:00,450
You must be hungry.

930
00:38:00,451 --> 00:38:01,507
(chuckles) Why?

931
00:38:01,508 --> 00:38:03,244
Because I cooked an inedible meal?

932
00:38:03,245 --> 00:38:06,061
Because it's the morning and
you cooked an inedible meal.

933
00:38:06,062 --> 00:38:07,625
- (laughs)
- Dad, we actually really have to go.

934
00:38:07,628 --> 00:38:09,149
- HENRY: Okay.
- Sorry, Jareth.

935
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:10,954
Not at all. One for the road, please.

936
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:11,975
(phone vibrating)

937
00:38:11,976 --> 00:38:12,994
Excuse me a minute.

938
00:38:12,995 --> 00:38:14,319
Hey, Nadine.

939
00:38:15,168 --> 00:38:17,559
Morejon wants to do what?

940
00:38:17,575 --> 00:38:19,443
(talking quietly)

941
00:38:19,444 --> 00:38:20,549
How much time?

942
00:38:21,922 --> 00:38:25,445
Um, tell the White House
I'm-I'm leaving now.

943
00:38:25,535 --> 00:38:28,744
Jareth, um, I really do look forward

944
00:38:28,745 --> 00:38:30,374
to getting to know you better.

945
00:38:30,375 --> 00:38:31,494
We have time.

946
00:38:31,495 --> 00:38:33,495
(mouthing)

947
00:38:35,285 --> 00:38:37,050
JACKSON: <i>Where does a junior senator</i>

948
00:38:37,051 --> 00:38:39,089
get the stones to sue the president?

949
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:40,589
In a democracy, there is indeed

950
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:43,020
a thing called checks and balances.

951
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:46,339
The Justice Department tried to
have the injunction dismissed,

952
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:49,929
but the presiding judge is dyed-
in-the-wool anti-immigration.

953
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:51,429
And once Morejon files it,

954
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:55,339
the refugee vetting process
will drag on even longer.

955
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:58,509
And I hate to say it,
but a highly public court case

956
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:01,089
would make holding onto
200 Libyan refugees

957
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:02,469
politically untenable for you, sir.

958
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:05,259
I didn't intend to take
responsibility for these people,

959
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,629
but now that we have, I'm not
going to just send them back.

960
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:08,629
Well, you're the president.

961
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:10,630
Accepting refugees is your prerogative.

962
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,049
ELIZABETH: Well, maybe we just

963
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:18,049
have to remind the senator
from Arizona of that.

964
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:19,070
(crowd cheering)

965
00:39:19,071 --> 00:39:20,089
Good morning, everybody!

966
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:23,090
Yeah. Here it is.

967
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,719
We're gonna do it.

968
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:32,339
We're here to show you
that we mean business.

969
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:34,340
(cameras clicking)

970
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:39,838
Senator Morejon.

971
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:43,389
I'm... whew... so glad I caught you.

972
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:45,719
You won't silence me again.

973
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,389
What I'm doing is legal.

974
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:48,390
So is this.

975
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:55,219
U.S. Refugee Act of 1980?

976
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:56,509
Section 207.

977
00:39:56,510 --> 00:40:00,839
It gives the president authority
to admit refugees to the U.S.

978
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:03,009
in emergency situations.

979
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:04,389
Doesn't apply.

980
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:06,760
My injunction is about
his executive order.

981
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:10,049
True.

982
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:14,009
You can still ban these

983
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:17,470
243 refugees, specifically.

984
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:24,089
But when the president pledged
to accept 20,000 Libyans,

985
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:26,299
he also will have the authority

986
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:30,259
to place them in any state he sees fit.

987
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:33,549
For instance, they might
feel right at home

988
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:36,799
in the dry desert climate
of your great state.

989
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,930
- (sighs)
- And they'll have you to thank.

990
00:40:38,933 --> 00:40:42,629
Well, some of your constituents
might not see it that way.

991
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:45,509
But then again,

992
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:49,389
one of those young
refugees could grow up

993
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:52,009
to become a United States senator.

994
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:55,130
And isn't that what
America's all about?

995
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:00,219
You have a great day...

996
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:02,219
Senator.

997
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:04,220
(cameras clicking, reporters murmuring)

998
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:11,339
Oh, babe.

999
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:13,429
Just bear with me, okay?

1000
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:15,509
I went back and looked
at the recordings

1001
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:16,929
that Russell mentioned, but this time,

1002
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:18,339
I knew that Shamekh was coerced.

1003
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:19,469
I think I found something.

1004
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:22,259
Here.

1005
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:25,259
In this, Shamekh is
running towards camera,

1006
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,509
so the audio's better.

1007
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:28,509
You speak Arabic,

1008
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:30,889
so listen to this and
tell me if I'm crazy

1009
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:33,889
or is this guy using his
last moment on Earth

1010
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:35,129
to tell us something.

1011
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:36,130
(taps keyboard)

1012
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,160
(shouting, explosion over headphones)

1013
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:45,219
ELIZABETH: <i>He says "Hijriyyah."
It's a woman's name.</i>

1014
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:47,622
- So he called for his mommy. How
does that help us? - ELIZABETH: No.

1015
00:41:47,623 --> 00:41:50,389
No one in Shamekh's family
or affiliates has that name.

1016
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:51,929
Fine then, it's his favorite sled.

1017
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:53,629
It means something.

1018
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:57,129
It is a very specific,
highly unusual name in Arabic.

1019
00:41:57,130 --> 00:41:57,839
He's right.

1020
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:58,799
In fact,

1021
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,390
I came across it last night.

1022
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:05,629
Idris Al Bouri...

1023
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:08,339
the warlord.

1024
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:11,339
And his daughter...

1025
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:12,390
Hijriyyah.

1026
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:15,469
Al Bouri announced his allegiance

1027
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:17,969
the day before our mechanic
says he saw Jibral Disah.

1028
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:19,389
And his wife. But he only got

1029
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:21,078
a glimpse of her hand, red with clay.

1030
00:42:21,079 --> 00:42:24,273
Or-or henna, a traditional
Muslim bridal ritual.

1031
00:42:24,274 --> 00:42:25,889
She wasn't one of Jibral Disah's

1032
00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:27,333
existing wives.

1033
00:42:27,334 --> 00:42:28,882
She was his new bride.

1034
00:42:28,883 --> 00:42:31,469
So Al Bouri gives her
up to Jibral Disah?

1035
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:33,089
Not gives, betroths.

1036
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:35,219
An insurance policy by allying himself

1037
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,299
with Disah through blood.

1038
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,339
Well, why didn't we know about it?

1039
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:38,299
Why the big secret?

1040
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:39,929
Okay, you're the most
wanted man in the world.

1041
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:41,429
You're hunted down like an animal,

1042
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:43,759
yet you take on a new
young bride anyway?

1043
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,509
But you keep it a secret...

1044
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:48,470
Because she is actually
important to him.

1045
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:52,846
That's a weakness we can exploit.

1046
00:42:54,090 --> 00:42:57,759
So we find the third wife,
and sooner or later...

1047
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:01,339
...we find the enemy.

1048
