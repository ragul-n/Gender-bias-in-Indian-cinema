1
00:03:24,951 --> 00:03:26,942
What's going on?

2
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,111
''- Examinations, sir.
- Or cheating?''

3
00:03:29,289 --> 00:03:31,280
''Who is cheating, sir ?''

4
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:35,784
''Would you want Rajesh Narain,
the best poet of the college...''

5
00:03:35,896 --> 00:03:40,629
caught cheating?
- No sir. You are mistaken.

6
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,791
Then what are you hiding?

7
00:03:43,803 --> 00:03:46,465
- Nothing sir.
- Let me take a look.

8
00:03:46,573 --> 00:03:49,303
- Show it to me.
- Forget it sir.

9
00:03:54,814 --> 00:03:59,649
A couple of pictures
of pretty girls...

10
00:03:59,753 --> 00:04:02,916
that's what was found in his
house while writing the test.

11
00:04:03,924 --> 00:04:05,915
Silence!

12
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,091
What does one make
of this picture?

13
00:04:08,762 --> 00:04:13,927
lt's thanks to this picture that
l'm successful in the test of love.

14
00:04:14,601 --> 00:04:20,267
But l don't want you to fail your grades
in M.A. because of this picture.

15
00:04:21,441 --> 00:04:24,103
''- Sir, my picture..?
- You have the negative, don't you?''

16
00:04:24,277 --> 00:04:26,268
You can have another made.

17
00:04:33,787 --> 00:04:36,449
Good heavens! Run!
The poet is on his way.

18
00:04:36,623 --> 00:04:39,956
He reads his lousy poems
and murders our mood!

19
00:04:40,126 --> 00:04:43,459
- What's going on?
- We've been waiting for you!

20
00:04:44,631 --> 00:04:46,622
l heard you wrote a
deadly poem last night.

21
00:04:46,733 --> 00:04:51,136
- l wrote a great one today.
- Good grief!

22
00:04:51,805 --> 00:04:54,467
Why are you dying? Hear this couplet
to revive your souls.

23
00:04:54,574 --> 00:04:56,974
- Encore..
- What he means is...

24
00:04:57,043 --> 00:05:00,137
l hope l don't miss my train
listening to your couplet.

25
00:05:00,747 --> 00:05:03,739
Shut up. Go ahead.
Take your time.

26
00:05:04,084 --> 00:05:05,574
Here goes.

27
00:05:05,752 --> 00:05:12,419
''Time fell against the stony floor
of fate and broke like a glass vessel''

28
00:05:12,525 --> 00:05:14,083
- Good Lord!
- Listen...

29
00:05:14,194 --> 00:05:19,097
- We're so sorry.
- Lousy appreciation.

30
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,190
But l'll still recite the poem.

31
00:05:22,102 --> 00:05:25,594
''Revolution will rise
soaked in blood''

32
00:05:25,939 --> 00:05:29,102
''The bugle of the war for
freedom cries out to us''

33
00:05:29,442 --> 00:05:32,775
''This murder and mayhem
actually ruins the nation''

34
00:05:32,946 --> 00:05:35,779
Ruin is preferable to slavery

35
00:05:36,116 --> 00:05:39,608
Always remember.
The noose is better than slavery.

36
00:05:39,853 --> 00:05:42,788
You hang by the noose.
Stop boring us.

37
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:46,781
The entire nation is
fighting the British.

38
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,123
But you can clap and listen
to Raju's songs.

39
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:55,793
''ln 1942, falling in love and writing
love songs is akin to betrayal.''

40
00:05:55,969 --> 00:06:03,239
l agree. My only crime is that
l love the rising and setting sun.

41
00:06:03,743 --> 00:06:06,234
l am a lover of moonlit nights.

42
00:06:06,746 --> 00:06:09,078
l'm crazy about the blooming buds.

43
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:11,577
When are you going to Agra?

44
00:06:13,353 --> 00:06:17,585
The British empire that you fight
is much smaller than Shakespeare.

45
00:06:17,757 --> 00:06:20,920
Poets like you will die
with their poems.

46
00:06:21,094 --> 00:06:25,258
''But Soor, Tulsi, Ghalib, Mir...
they will remain immortal.''

47
00:06:25,765 --> 00:06:27,756
Talk of lovers and beloveds...

48
00:06:27,934 --> 00:06:34,772
The last day of the University is
getting wasted. Sing something good.

49
00:06:35,942 --> 00:06:38,604
- Do l have your permission?
- By all means.

50
00:06:38,712 --> 00:06:41,112
''lf you wish, l can arrange
for the musical accompaniments?''

51
00:06:41,781 --> 00:06:47,276
ln the journey of my heart...

52
00:06:47,787 --> 00:06:52,281
l have come across many lovers

53
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:59,455
''l don't know what
attracts me to you..''

54
00:07:00,133 --> 00:07:04,229
''the sight of you makes
me love you even more''

55
00:07:04,404 --> 00:07:08,738
- Terrific!
- The outcome of a weak vision!

56
00:07:10,076 --> 00:07:14,570
l too can get up...

57
00:07:15,081 --> 00:07:20,075
and walk away from you

58
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:26,753
But l will surely miss...

59
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:32,095
the walls of your house

60
00:07:35,268 --> 00:07:40,262
Don't believe those eyes...

61
00:07:41,107 --> 00:07:45,771
they are not to be trusted

62
00:07:47,113 --> 00:07:52,107
''You're a commodity on sale.
What's your hurry?''

63
00:07:52,619 --> 00:07:57,613
''There are other marketplaces
for you''

64
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:00,725
That was truly terrific!

65
00:08:03,062 --> 00:08:05,053
A telegram for you.

66
00:08:15,742 --> 00:08:17,733
''Guard, how long will
this train halt here?''

67
00:08:17,844 --> 00:08:18,833
Only 5 minutes.

68
00:08:35,428 --> 00:08:37,760
You look terrific in this uniform!

69
00:08:39,766 --> 00:08:41,597
How's your romance going?

70
00:08:41,768 --> 00:08:44,760
l've taken the first vow.
The other 6 will be done soon.

71
00:08:45,271 --> 00:08:48,263
- Marriage arranged?
- Dimwit!

72
00:08:48,441 --> 00:08:51,774
''Now that you're here, you can
choose the girl and l'll marry her.''

73
00:08:52,111 --> 00:08:54,443
Are you getting married or me?

74
00:08:54,614 --> 00:08:58,448
''This time it's me. But when you
get married, l'll choose the bride.''

75
00:08:58,785 --> 00:09:01,720
But l'm on my way to
Ghazipur to join duty.

76
00:09:01,888 --> 00:09:04,721
- How can l choose her?
- Then l'm not getting married!

77
00:09:05,058 --> 00:09:07,549
Show me the picture.
l'll decide right now.

78
00:09:07,827 --> 00:09:11,228
The tragedy is the
examiner confiscated it.

79
00:09:14,567 --> 00:09:17,058
- When are you coming to Ghazipur?
- l'm going to Jaunpur tomorrow.

80
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:19,900
''l'll meet brother, his wife and
daughter and come in a day or two.''

81
00:09:21,741 --> 00:09:23,732
What are you doing?
l'm the one leaving!

82
00:09:25,745 --> 00:09:27,736
''Run, you'll miss the train!''

83
00:09:41,261 --> 00:09:44,094
lsn't the train arriving at 2.30?

84
00:09:46,599 --> 00:09:48,590
lt must have come already.

85
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:52,432
God knows. The war is on.

86
00:09:52,538 --> 00:09:54,597
Today's train might
even come tomorrow.

87
00:09:54,774 --> 00:09:58,767
The train doesn't know
you are waiting for it.

88
00:09:59,612 --> 00:10:04,948
- Little brother must be waiting.
- Who must be waiting?

89
00:10:05,118 --> 00:10:10,112
- l'll give you a slap!
- Don't mess with me.

90
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:14,784
Or l'll tell my uncle
not to marry you!

91
00:10:14,894 --> 00:10:18,625
You and your uncle!
You'll get a spanking!

92
00:10:18,798 --> 00:10:21,460
- Take uncle's bags in.
- Uncle has come!

93
00:10:23,469 --> 00:10:27,633
Why are you so anxious?
He'll come in his own time.

94
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:35,474
Sit patiently and wait.
The train and uncle have come.

95
00:10:35,815 --> 00:10:38,978
But l told uncle not to see you!

96
00:10:39,152 --> 00:10:41,313
Now fight with me!

97
00:10:42,488 --> 00:10:44,479
Silly girl!

98
00:10:45,491 --> 00:10:53,159
''You haven't changed, brother.
Running a paper, spinning cloth...''

99
00:10:53,266 --> 00:10:55,166
it won't get you freedom.

100
00:10:55,335 --> 00:11:00,773
Do you know the fate of the
struggle spun by this yarn?

101
00:11:01,607 --> 00:11:05,270
You need yarn even for the shroud.

102
00:11:05,778 --> 00:11:10,272
We are spinning yarn for the
shroud of the British rule.

103
00:11:12,618 --> 00:11:15,280
Then it will take centuries
to weave it.

104
00:11:15,788 --> 00:11:19,121
Time moves much faster
than the spinning wheel.

105
00:11:20,026 --> 00:11:22,290
She too is very fast!

106
00:11:26,299 --> 00:11:29,132
lt's so very hot!

107
00:11:29,469 --> 00:11:34,805
- What are you sewing in this heat?
- A dress for Prarthana's wedding.

108
00:11:34,974 --> 00:11:38,466
Brijesh has gone mad.

109
00:11:38,811 --> 00:11:43,976
He publishes a Hindi newspaper
and dreams of freeing lndia.

110
00:11:51,991 --> 00:11:55,984
''- Hello uncle, aunt.
- Forget these old lndian customs.''

111
00:11:59,332 --> 00:12:02,096
- When did you arrive?
- A little while ago.

112
00:12:03,936 --> 00:12:05,927
Where did you get this tailor from?

113
00:12:07,106 --> 00:12:09,267
''No tailor, it's a seamstress.''

114
00:12:10,109 --> 00:12:12,600
l think l'll get
some shirts stitched too.

115
00:12:16,783 --> 00:12:21,277
Why don't you talk to your brother?

116
00:12:21,454 --> 00:12:25,288
The British government won't
be cowed by that naked fakir.

117
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:27,949
These newspapers will die away.

118
00:12:28,294 --> 00:12:31,127
One shouldn't fight
the sharks in the sea.

119
00:12:31,564 --> 00:12:36,627
l'm not interested in politics.
But if one must have an enemy...

120
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,633
then why not oppose the shark?

121
00:12:42,575 --> 00:12:45,806
Forget that. You've
completed your education.

122
00:12:46,145 --> 00:12:47,635
''lf you wish, l can get you a job.''

123
00:12:49,148 --> 00:12:51,981
l want to finish my MA and
teach Literature in a University.

124
00:12:55,655 --> 00:12:59,318
What salary does a Professor get?
- About 3 to 400.

125
00:12:59,826 --> 00:13:02,761
That's what the Governor's cook gets.

126
00:13:03,096 --> 00:13:05,929
That's all right. l too will
become the cook of a Lord.

127
00:13:07,433 --> 00:13:09,765
lt still won't help!

128
00:13:11,437 --> 00:13:14,600
''Uncle, l must make a move
or l'll get thrashed.''

129
00:13:14,941 --> 00:13:16,932
Munni is waiting for me.

130
00:13:19,779 --> 00:13:21,770
Something is fishy.

131
00:13:30,123 --> 00:13:33,456
''She won't be able
to stretch her arms''

132
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:37,452
The sight of me made her
throw up her arms!

133
00:13:38,798 --> 00:13:42,791
l'm not scared of you that
l won't stretch in front of you.

134
00:13:45,238 --> 00:13:49,140
Enough! Stay like that.

135
00:13:51,144 --> 00:13:53,977
Don't stretch in front of me...

136
00:13:54,814 --> 00:13:58,306
your body is made of glass.
lt might just crack.

137
00:13:59,152 --> 00:14:02,087
Recite poems and waste your life.

138
00:14:02,255 --> 00:14:04,416
- Fool!
- Why?

139
00:14:06,092 --> 00:14:10,256
l'll spend my life
looking into these eyes.

140
00:14:11,764 --> 00:14:13,755
Touching these lips.

141
00:14:14,767 --> 00:14:16,758
Playing with these locks.

142
00:14:17,103 --> 00:14:19,264
Entangled in these arms.

143
00:14:19,772 --> 00:14:22,104
l don't like this kind of love.

144
00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:29,942
My heart too has been
wounded by our separation.

145
00:14:30,616 --> 00:14:33,449
l'd have died had it
not been for your love!

146
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,281
- Dead!
- Actually dead.

147
00:14:36,389 --> 00:14:39,290
- Let go!
- Listen...

148
00:14:40,793 --> 00:14:42,784
What do you want
from Kamini's room?

149
00:14:42,895 --> 00:14:47,457
- l'm looking for a book.
- Not there! Hide there.

150
00:14:48,801 --> 00:14:50,792
Your head can be seen. Lower!

151
00:14:52,305 --> 00:14:55,138
You don't understand.
Something is fishy.

152
00:14:58,144 --> 00:15:00,135
''Daddy, what are you looking for?''

153
00:15:01,747 --> 00:15:04,580
What am l looking for?
Why have l come here?

154
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,742
You're looking
for some silly book!

155
00:15:10,256 --> 00:15:12,918
Where is that..?
Where could he be?

156
00:15:13,092 --> 00:15:15,253
''l am right here, but l won't tell.''

157
00:15:15,928 --> 00:15:18,590
- My article?
- ln the library.

158
00:15:20,766 --> 00:15:23,257
The library isn't there.
lt's that way.

159
00:15:28,774 --> 00:15:31,607
- The library is over there?
- Yes.

160
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:50,119
''There can't be a love story
without hide and seek, right?''

161
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:56,124
Let me tell you a story

162
00:15:57,803 --> 00:16:00,897
With youth comes...

163
00:16:01,073 --> 00:16:06,909
a love story

164
00:16:07,413 --> 00:16:09,745
ln a love story...

165
00:16:10,082 --> 00:16:12,573
there's a boy...

166
00:16:13,085 --> 00:16:15,747
and there's a girl

167
00:16:16,088 --> 00:16:21,754
''They laugh,
they cry''

168
00:16:22,428 --> 00:16:24,760
ln a love story...

169
00:16:25,264 --> 00:16:27,755
there's a boy...

170
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,762
and there's a girl

171
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:36,765
''They laugh,
they cry''

172
00:16:37,843 --> 00:16:40,277
ln a love story...

173
00:16:40,446 --> 00:16:42,937
there's a boy...

174
00:16:43,449 --> 00:16:45,940
and there's a girl

175
00:16:46,619 --> 00:16:52,114
They laugh and cry together

176
00:17:15,247 --> 00:17:20,913
lt's always a small spark...

177
00:17:27,193 --> 00:17:32,597
''that burns and blows
the world asunder''

178
00:17:32,932 --> 00:17:38,268
''On moonlit nights...
there is a lamp...''

179
00:17:38,771 --> 00:17:41,262
which has a wick...

180
00:17:41,874 --> 00:17:47,278
''They burn and are
extinguished together''

181
00:17:48,114 --> 00:17:50,446
ln a love story...

182
00:17:50,783 --> 00:17:53,274
there's a boy...

183
00:17:53,786 --> 00:17:56,277
and there's a girl

184
00:17:56,789 --> 00:18:02,728
''They laugh,
they cry''

185
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:29,915
''From over the mountains
when the rains arrive...''

186
00:18:42,201 --> 00:18:47,434
''it drives the lovers mad, my love''

187
00:18:48,107 --> 00:18:50,268
ln the rains...

188
00:18:50,776 --> 00:18:53,267
there are clouds...

189
00:18:53,779 --> 00:18:56,270
and there is lightning...

190
00:18:56,782 --> 00:19:02,379
''they long...
and it pours''

191
00:19:03,222 --> 00:19:05,383
ln a love story...

192
00:19:05,724 --> 00:19:08,215
there's a boy...

193
00:19:08,727 --> 00:19:11,218
and there's a girl

194
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:16,724
''They laugh,
they cry''

195
00:19:39,091 --> 00:19:44,757
With union there is separation

196
00:19:50,503 --> 00:19:56,271
''Life is like a joke,
a play''

197
00:19:56,609 --> 00:19:58,770
ln a play like this...

198
00:19:59,111 --> 00:20:01,272
there's a King

199
00:20:02,114 --> 00:20:04,605
There's a Queen

200
00:20:05,117 --> 00:20:07,779
They meet...

201
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,611
they are separated

202
00:20:11,557 --> 00:20:13,787
ln a love story...

203
00:20:14,126 --> 00:20:16,617
there's a boy...

204
00:20:16,962 --> 00:20:19,453
and there's a girl

205
00:20:19,798 --> 00:20:25,293
''They laugh,
they cry''

206
00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:49,150
This is how the curtain is.

207
00:20:50,663 --> 00:20:55,999
Neither is she fully in the open
nor completely hidden.

208
00:20:58,003 --> 00:21:02,269
What would you do if Ghalib
hadn't left the wall behind?

209
00:21:03,609 --> 00:21:05,600
Romance.

210
00:21:12,117 --> 00:21:14,449
Fisticuffs and fights?

211
00:21:14,787 --> 00:21:18,279
Fights with the lovely one
aren't her fault at all.

212
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:21,450
l was the one who fell
in love with her.

213
00:21:21,627 --> 00:21:24,460
- With whom?
- Come here and l'll tell you.

214
00:21:24,797 --> 00:21:28,460
Why should l always come there?
Do you have henna on your feet?

215
00:21:29,301 --> 00:21:33,135
Someday l'll get your hands
and feet colored with henna.

216
00:21:33,238 --> 00:21:35,229
With grandeur. Shall l come?

217
00:21:35,975 --> 00:21:39,308
- How would l know?
- But l do.

218
00:21:39,812 --> 00:21:43,145
- What do you know?
- You light lamps and dream of me.

219
00:21:43,315 --> 00:21:46,807
What hopes!

220
00:21:47,987 --> 00:21:50,820
l have a poetry exam tomorrow.
l'm trying to memorize it.

221
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:52,981
Let's see what you're learning...

222
00:21:53,826 --> 00:21:58,320
What is Ras Khan? Reading
Rajesh Khan is better.

223
00:21:58,831 --> 00:22:03,768
Anwar will have fun over there.
And l'll be getting bored.

224
00:22:04,103 --> 00:22:07,436
- Then what should we do?
- Have a rehearsal of marriage.

225
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,931
Stay away!
Somebody might see us.

226
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:15,103
- You should be serious.
- Marriage makes everyone serious.

227
00:22:17,783 --> 00:22:20,115
The fun of meeting like this
will be lost.

228
00:22:20,285 --> 00:22:23,277
You'll walk right
into the bedroom.

229
00:22:23,455 --> 00:22:25,446
lt will ruin the romance.

230
00:22:27,626 --> 00:22:29,958
- Then don't get married.
- Why not?

231
00:22:30,129 --> 00:22:32,120
''lf l won't marry you,
somebody else will.''

232
00:22:32,231 --> 00:22:34,961
''All my life, l'll imagine things
and envy him...''

233
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:39,794
that he must be playing
with your locks...

234
00:22:43,809 --> 00:22:45,800
looking deep into these eyes.

235
00:22:48,814 --> 00:22:50,805
Locking his lips with these.

236
00:22:53,819 --> 00:22:55,980
l...l'm going.

237
00:23:03,762 --> 00:23:05,753
Go on.

238
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:13,761
''l've gone, too.''

239
00:23:41,133 --> 00:23:46,799
''Girls, keep quiet. The priest
is coming. For God's sake!''

240
00:23:55,814 --> 00:24:00,148
''Fatima Bibi, daughter of
the late Syedali Amjad.''

241
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:05,755
Do you accept marriage to
Anwar son of Baqar Hussein Zaidi..

242
00:24:05,858 --> 00:24:11,922
..for a dowry of 14000
sovereigns and 5 dinars?

243
00:24:13,265 --> 00:24:15,256
Do you accept?

244
00:24:18,437 --> 00:24:22,271
l will ask you when your turn comes.

245
00:24:24,009 --> 00:24:28,275
Son of Baqar Hussein Zaidi...

246
00:24:28,614 --> 00:24:33,779
''Do you agree to marry Fatima,
daughter of Syed Ali Amjad...''

247
00:24:33,886 --> 00:24:38,789
for a dowry of 14000
sovereigns and 5 dinars?

248
00:24:38,957 --> 00:24:40,288
Yes.

249
00:24:40,459 --> 00:24:42,620
Good gracious! You too!

250
00:24:43,128 --> 00:24:47,292
We'll ask you when your turn comes.

251
00:24:47,466 --> 00:24:51,300
- Do you accept?
- Yes.

252
00:24:51,637 --> 00:24:54,629
Now both of us have accepted.

253
00:25:04,416 --> 00:25:08,910
''Kamini, daughter of Shrikant Sinha...''

254
00:25:10,856 --> 00:25:18,262
do you agree to marry Rajesh
Narain for 14000 kisses a year?

255
00:25:18,363 --> 00:25:20,593
And 2 poems every week?

256
00:25:23,602 --> 00:25:25,593
l accept.

257
00:25:30,108 --> 00:25:33,271
''Rajesh Narain, son of
Kamlesh Narain...''

258
00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:39,775
do you agree to accept 14000
abuses from your wife every year...

259
00:25:39,885 --> 00:25:42,786
and 2 fights per week.
Would you like to marry her?

260
00:25:43,789 --> 00:25:45,450
- No.
- Why?

261
00:25:45,791 --> 00:25:48,783
- l'll have to love you!
- So what?

262
00:25:49,127 --> 00:25:53,962
''lf l fall in love with you,
l will miss you''

263
00:25:55,801 --> 00:26:00,238
''When l miss you,
you and l will meet''

264
00:26:08,413 --> 00:26:10,404
When you and l meet...

265
00:26:11,416 --> 00:26:14,249
''When you and l meet,
people will watch us...''

266
00:26:14,353 --> 00:26:19,256
they will watch us and...

267
00:26:20,092 --> 00:26:25,758
let's not be seen by anyone

268
00:26:26,265 --> 00:26:30,929
Let's drown in the sea

269
00:26:37,109 --> 00:26:41,773
Let's not be seen by anyone;...

270
00:26:42,514 --> 00:26:46,610
let's drown in the sea

271
00:26:52,958 --> 00:26:57,793
Let's not be seen by anyone;...

272
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:02,726
let's drown in the sea

273
00:27:35,434 --> 00:27:39,928
''You have applied
kohl in your eyes...''

274
00:27:40,772 --> 00:27:44,765
''why haven't you worn
flowers in your hair?''

275
00:27:55,787 --> 00:27:58,620
''When you toss your hair,
it'll bring about a cloud''

276
00:27:59,791 --> 00:28:02,726
The clouds will pour

277
00:28:09,067 --> 00:28:11,900
''When it pours,
it'll make me pine''

278
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:14,903
And when l pine...

279
00:28:15,407 --> 00:28:20,242
why must l make myself pine?

280
00:28:21,079 --> 00:28:25,573
Let's drown in the sea

281
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:36,084
Let's not be seen by anyone

282
00:28:36,762 --> 00:28:41,096
Let's drown in the sea

283
00:28:57,949 --> 00:29:02,386
There's so much more to talk about

284
00:29:03,055 --> 00:29:07,219
''So why are you
looking away from me?''

285
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:20,732
''When our eyes meet,
it'll set our hearts beating''

286
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,731
''Our pounding hearts
will set off a fire''

287
00:29:31,249 --> 00:29:36,243
The flames will leap and...

288
00:29:36,588 --> 00:29:42,584
''let's put out the fires
in our heart...''

289
00:29:42,928 --> 00:29:47,092
Let's drown in the sea

290
00:29:53,271 --> 00:29:58,265
Let's not anyone see us...

291
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:06,774
let's drown in the sea

292
00:30:26,471 --> 00:30:29,133
Look at this carefully. He's
going to be your son-in-law.

293
00:30:31,143 --> 00:30:33,805
But think of Baby...

294
00:30:33,979 --> 00:30:35,810
l've chosen him with her in mind.

295
00:30:35,914 --> 00:30:38,314
''The son of a judge,
he's in the lndian Police Service.''

296
00:30:38,416 --> 00:30:40,475
And he's the DSP at the age of 25.

297
00:30:40,819 --> 00:30:44,482
Hail the Revolution!

298
00:30:44,823 --> 00:30:48,315
Our slogan is:
lndia belongs to us!

299
00:30:50,662 --> 00:30:52,653
ls father going back to jail?

300
00:30:53,165 --> 00:30:55,156
Why don't you go to jail?

301
00:30:55,333 --> 00:30:58,825
''lf l go to jail, who will
get a groom for your doll?''

302
00:30:59,171 --> 00:31:02,766
- When will he return?
- When the government frees him.

303
00:31:02,941 --> 00:31:05,774
Why does father always go to jail?

304
00:31:05,944 --> 00:31:09,607
Maybe he loves us less.
What do you think?

305
00:31:09,781 --> 00:31:11,271
l feel the same too.

306
00:31:11,783 --> 00:31:13,774
What are uncle and niece up to?

307
00:31:13,952 --> 00:31:17,444
Munni wants to know why
you keep going to prison.

308
00:31:17,789 --> 00:31:23,955
''When you can't understand why
l go to jail, how will she?''

309
00:31:24,129 --> 00:31:28,122
l can't understand how we can gain
independence by spinning yarn.

310
00:31:28,466 --> 00:31:32,300
How can you defeat the empire on
which the sun never sets ...

311
00:31:32,404 --> 00:31:35,134
''...with one spinning wheel,
one flag and one slogan?''

312
00:31:35,307 --> 00:31:41,974
''You are wrong. For the soldier of
the country, the flag is a weapon.''

313
00:31:42,147 --> 00:31:45,480
The spinning wheel and the
slogan too are weapons.

314
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:49,643
So fight with these weapons. But if
the English are here on your return..

315
00:31:49,821 --> 00:31:54,815
- will you concede defeat?
- You are the poet.

316
00:31:54,993 --> 00:31:58,986
But listen to this couplet.
Our courage is not broken.

317
00:31:59,164 --> 00:32:01,098
l am still inspired.

318
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:06,264
Victory and defeat mean nothing to me.
lt's my war and l fought it.

319
00:32:06,605 --> 00:32:11,269
Hail the revolution!

320
00:33:47,806 --> 00:33:49,967
Call out to your father....

321
00:33:50,809 --> 00:33:54,301
He will return if you do.

322
00:33:55,814 --> 00:33:57,805
Call out to him!

323
00:34:06,758 --> 00:34:12,594
''Be brave. lf you burst into
tears, how will we manage?''

324
00:34:13,765 --> 00:34:15,756
You're going to manage this house.

325
00:34:16,935 --> 00:34:20,769
Think of me and this little child.

326
00:34:21,773 --> 00:34:25,766
''lt will be terrible,
if she goes into a shock.''

327
00:34:27,612 --> 00:34:30,775
Wipe your tears.

328
00:34:32,117 --> 00:34:35,780
My brother always wiped my tears.

329
00:34:36,788 --> 00:34:38,779
l don't know how to wipe my tears.

330
00:34:40,291 --> 00:34:42,282
And he isn't getting up
to wipe my tears.

331
00:34:42,627 --> 00:34:44,618
l'll wipe them for you.

332
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:51,797
''Don't cry. lf you cry, l too will
turn into a statue like father.''

333
00:34:57,976 --> 00:35:02,072
''Don't cry. l say, don't cry.''

334
00:35:04,582 --> 00:35:06,573
l had said...

335
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,752
''his love for the family
has diminished, hadn't l?''

336
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:20,755
Don't insult the sacrifice
he has made.

337
00:35:21,099 --> 00:35:26,435
''The one who gives up his life
for the country, never dies.''

338
00:35:27,272 --> 00:35:32,107
This house is blessed
with the mark of his blood.

339
00:35:33,778 --> 00:35:36,110
The bangles in my hand are broken.

340
00:35:37,615 --> 00:35:39,606
The vermilion on my forehead
is no more.

341
00:35:40,618 --> 00:35:43,781
But l'm not crying.

342
00:35:45,123 --> 00:35:50,117
lt's a matter of pride
to be the widow of a martyr.

343
00:36:00,572 --> 00:36:04,906
Our decision is not to
take you in the party.

344
00:36:05,076 --> 00:36:06,737
Why not?
- Because one sacrifice...

345
00:36:06,811 --> 00:36:08,745
is enough for a family.

346
00:36:08,913 --> 00:36:13,748
Sacrifices are not counted.
Munni asks me everyday...

347
00:36:13,818 --> 00:36:15,080
where is her father?
And when he will return.

348
00:36:15,353 --> 00:36:19,255
Do you want to join the party
to avenge your brother's death?

349
00:36:19,524 --> 00:36:23,426
l don't have to come to you
to avenge his death.

350
00:36:24,095 --> 00:36:27,758
- Then?
- His brother's death has affected him

351
00:36:28,099 --> 00:36:30,260
''Like us, he too wants to
die for independence.''

352
00:36:30,602 --> 00:36:33,435
No! l don't want to live
in slavery.

353
00:36:34,772 --> 00:36:36,763
The English didn't kill him.

354
00:36:36,875 --> 00:36:38,934
lt's the slavery of our nation
that has killed him!

355
00:36:39,611 --> 00:36:44,605
''When he died, the entire city
stood by, watching like cowards.''

356
00:36:45,283 --> 00:36:50,778
l don't want to insult my brother
by living with these cowards!

357
00:36:50,955 --> 00:36:55,790
''lf you don't want to live like
a slave, learn to be a martyr.''

358
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,622
l haven't come to you
to learn how to die!

359
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:02,222
l want to die after killing some
Englishmen. Teach that to me!

360
00:37:02,567 --> 00:37:04,558
What happens to Munni
and her mother then?

361
00:37:06,571 --> 00:37:09,233
Who is Munni or her mother?

362
00:37:11,075 --> 00:37:13,066
l have no relations
with anyone anymore.

363
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:19,243
- You can never marry Rajesh.
- Why not?

364
00:37:21,686 --> 00:37:26,419
lf you won't marry me off
to Rajesh...

365
00:37:27,091 --> 00:37:29,753
l will marry him myself!

366
00:37:30,094 --> 00:37:31,755
''Do you hear, wife?''

367
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:35,422
she wants to marry the man whose
brother was a broke Congressman.

368
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:42,767
The man you poke fun at today
will be worshipped tomorrow.

369
00:37:43,775 --> 00:37:47,939
And nobody will even mention
names of men like you!

370
00:37:51,115 --> 00:37:54,278
Tell her to take her
proposal to Rajesh herself.

371
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:12,233
- Where's sister-in-law?
- She's away gone to the temple.

372
00:38:13,237 --> 00:38:15,228
- Listen...
- You listen.

373
00:38:15,406 --> 00:38:17,897
l wrote a poem last night.
Like to hear it?

374
00:38:18,076 --> 00:38:19,566
Sure.

375
00:38:20,078 --> 00:38:22,740
A song in the morning and
one in the evening...

376
00:38:22,914 --> 00:38:24,905
but only after we're married.

377
00:38:25,083 --> 00:38:28,746
- Marriage?
- l've brought my own proposal.

378
00:38:30,088 --> 00:38:33,751
- With whom?
- You.

379
00:38:35,093 --> 00:38:39,587
Who else?
- With me...?

380
00:38:40,264 --> 00:38:42,255
Daddy is not in favor
of our marriage.

381
00:38:42,367 --> 00:38:46,770
''l insisted, so Daddy asked me
to carry my own proposal.''

382
00:38:47,105 --> 00:38:51,269
Strange! This is the first time
l find a girl proposing marriage.

383
00:38:51,609 --> 00:38:55,602
- Skip the jokes.
- l can't quit jokes and romance.

384
00:38:55,713 --> 00:38:57,772
That can be done after marriage.

385
00:38:57,882 --> 00:38:59,873
Everything fades away
after marriage.

386
00:38:59,951 --> 00:39:03,045
Forget about marriage.
And just keep romancing me.

387
00:39:03,154 --> 00:39:05,213
''l'll be happy, so will you.''

388
00:39:10,395 --> 00:39:13,558
''Look, l'm a poet.''

389
00:39:14,065 --> 00:39:17,728
l can't tie the noose of
your arms around my neck.

390
00:39:18,569 --> 00:39:22,403
''For me, you were the blank sheet
of paper on which l wrote my poems.''

391
00:39:23,074 --> 00:39:28,910
''Remember, l told you the other night,
Marriage ruins all the romance''

392
00:39:29,247 --> 00:39:34,082
That night you also said you'd
color my hands and feet with henna.

393
00:39:34,752 --> 00:39:37,414
l did. l said that.

394
00:39:41,092 --> 00:39:46,428
''You forget those were
promises of love, not marriage.''

395
00:39:48,766 --> 00:39:53,260
Very well. l haven't
come here to beg you..

396
00:39:53,771 --> 00:39:55,762
...to marry me.

397
00:39:56,107 --> 00:40:00,271
Nor have l come to say
that l'll commit suicide!

398
00:40:00,778 --> 00:40:06,614
''Do you think l'll remain unwed
for life, if you don't marry me?''

399
00:40:07,285 --> 00:40:11,449
l will get married and
to a decent man too!

400
00:40:11,789 --> 00:40:15,452
And you'll regret it all your life!

401
00:40:22,633 --> 00:40:26,797
l'm amazed that l couldn't see
through you in all these years.

402
00:40:28,139 --> 00:40:31,802
''Still, thank you very much.''

403
00:40:34,145 --> 00:40:38,980
''ln good time, you have told me
what a despicable man you are!''

404
00:41:00,772 --> 00:41:05,607
''This is one way of initiating
a sacrifice too, brother.''

405
00:41:09,781 --> 00:41:15,117
''Mom, Daddy was right. l don't want
to marry that broke freedom fighter.''

406
00:41:17,121 --> 00:41:21,956
Have you had a fight with Rajesh?
- No. l'm rid of him.

407
00:41:22,126 --> 00:41:24,617
l don't want to be the noose
around a poet's neck.

408
00:41:24,962 --> 00:41:28,454
''Tell Daddy, he can marry me
to whomsoever he wishes.''

409
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:37,304
Your father has chosen a boy for you.
Should l show you the picture?

410
00:41:37,809 --> 00:41:40,300
l had chosen a live man.

411
00:41:41,145 --> 00:41:44,808
And l couldn't understand him.
So what will l do with a picture?

412
00:41:45,483 --> 00:41:48,816
''lf Daddy has chosen him,
he must be good too.''

413
00:41:49,821 --> 00:41:51,982
l don't trust my own eyes anymore.

414
00:42:12,777 --> 00:42:14,768
What do you want?

415
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:20,444
l want to bury you
in the land you rule!

416
00:42:27,291 --> 00:42:31,125
Did he show any mercy when he ordered
his men to shoot my brother?

417
00:42:31,462 --> 00:42:34,795
''Did he think that my sister-in-law
would be widowed, and Munni orphaned!''

418
00:42:35,132 --> 00:42:37,965
''lf you're man enough,
give me a revolver.''

419
00:42:38,803 --> 00:42:45,140
''When you ordered your men to open fire,
did you give the lndians any weapons?''

420
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:53,814
''Before you die, say
Long live the revolution''

421
00:42:55,553 --> 00:42:57,145
Long live the revolution!

422
00:42:58,689 --> 00:43:00,418
Long live the revolution!

423
00:43:25,449 --> 00:43:28,111
Who is this Rajesh?
Why hasn't he been arrested?

424
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:08,087
''Sir, we always try to arrest him.
Our bad luck, he escapes.''

425
00:44:09,427 --> 00:44:11,759
This is uncle's picture.

426
00:44:12,263 --> 00:44:15,255
A reward of 25000!

427
00:44:15,433 --> 00:44:17,765
What is uncle being rewarded for?

428
00:44:17,935 --> 00:44:21,928
- For fighting for the country.
- l too will fight for the nation.

429
00:44:22,106 --> 00:44:24,768
- But l won't talk to uncle.
- Why not?

430
00:44:24,942 --> 00:44:29,276
He hasn't come to see me for months!
l won't talk to him anymore!

431
00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:36,113
- How are you?
- You were mad at him.

432
00:44:36,454 --> 00:44:38,786
''And the moment he comes,
you climb into his lap!''

433
00:44:38,956 --> 00:44:45,623
- Where had you gone away?
- To look for a groom for you.

434
00:44:45,963 --> 00:44:47,954
Did you find one?

435
00:44:49,967 --> 00:44:51,958
How's everything?

436
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:56,964
What shall l say?
Kamini no longer comes here.

437
00:44:57,141 --> 00:44:59,974
She's getting married.
With great pomp.

438
00:45:48,793 --> 00:45:50,784
Leave my uncle alone!

439
00:47:01,065 --> 00:47:03,556
Munni! No!

440
00:47:03,901 --> 00:47:05,869
My child...!

441
00:47:06,737 --> 00:47:08,728
What's happened to Munni?

442
00:47:32,429 --> 00:47:34,920
There was no other way.

443
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:38,933
When the police advanced
with their guns...

444
00:47:39,770 --> 00:47:44,434
l was afraid she'd
scream in horror.

445
00:47:45,442 --> 00:47:48,605
She tried to get out of my hands.

446
00:47:49,446 --> 00:47:53,780
But l wouldn't take off
my hand from her mouth.

447
00:47:55,786 --> 00:48:00,223
''Had she spoken up, the
police would've caught you!''

448
00:48:10,234 --> 00:48:14,227
''Nobody knows your name, Munni.''

449
00:48:15,573 --> 00:48:20,909
But after the English are
thrown out of lndia...

450
00:48:21,078 --> 00:48:23,069
the first rose that blossoms...

451
00:48:23,747 --> 00:48:27,581
will bear the color of your blood
and the fragrance of your childhood.

452
00:48:40,598 --> 00:48:43,431
- Hold his hand.
- lt's okay.

453
00:48:43,767 --> 00:48:46,258
''You don't know how painful
it can be, Rajesh.''

454
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,733
The cops are out in the lanes.
They've probably got to know about us.

455
00:49:24,575 --> 00:49:27,237
Give me a revolver.

456
00:49:29,413 --> 00:49:34,077
- What do you mean?
- Carry me to the statue.

457
00:49:36,086 --> 00:49:37,576
And you guys make a getaway.

458
00:49:37,688 --> 00:49:41,249
''- Don't be crazy, Rajesh.
- Don't be stubborn, Khalid.''

459
00:49:42,092 --> 00:49:46,586
''lf you leave right away, l might
be able to hold the cops for a while.''

460
00:49:47,097 --> 00:49:50,760
''lf you act stubborn,
we aren't going away either.''

461
00:49:51,168 --> 00:49:56,936
But where will you
take me in this state?

462
00:49:57,941 --> 00:50:01,104
ls there anyone in this city
who will give me shelter?

463
00:50:02,613 --> 00:50:06,447
Not here. But there is
someone in Ghazipur.

464
00:50:11,288 --> 00:50:15,281
You mean Dheeraj?

465
00:50:15,626 --> 00:50:18,789
Yes.
- But he's Superintendent of Police.

466
00:50:21,131 --> 00:50:25,124
So what? Much before
he became a cop...

467
00:50:26,470 --> 00:50:28,461
he has been my friend1

468
00:50:28,806 --> 00:50:30,137
You trust him so much?

469
00:50:31,308 --> 00:50:38,146
l don't trust myself as much
as l trust him!

470
00:50:38,816 --> 00:50:40,807
l'll get the truck out.

471
00:50:52,830 --> 00:50:59,326
''- Good day, Sher Khan.
- Good day to you too, Khalid.''

472
00:51:00,270 --> 00:51:04,764
''- What brings you here?
- l have a problem, Sher Khan.''

473
00:51:11,782 --> 00:51:14,273
''lf it concerns goods,
l can provide that.''

474
00:51:14,451 --> 00:51:16,942
''lf it concerns life,
my head is at your service.''

475
00:51:17,054 --> 00:51:19,955
You're always talking
about killing and dying.

476
00:51:20,124 --> 00:51:23,116
lt has nothing to do with that.
l need some help.

477
00:51:23,293 --> 00:51:26,956
- Command me.
- A friend of mine is wounded.

478
00:51:27,131 --> 00:51:31,124
- He has to be taken to Ghazipur.
- ls that all? l'll take him there.

479
00:51:32,970 --> 00:51:37,805
But why don't you take him
to the hospital if he's wounded?

480
00:51:39,476 --> 00:51:43,310
''He's a revolutionary,
a soldier of freedom.''

481
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:45,141
They've issued a warrant
for his arrest.

482
00:51:45,249 --> 00:51:47,809
l can't trust anybody but you
to do this job.

483
00:51:48,485 --> 00:51:51,147
''Trust, you must place only in God.''

484
00:51:52,156 --> 00:51:54,147
Where have l to take him
in Ghazipur?

485
00:51:58,162 --> 00:51:59,652
To the Superintendent
Dheeraj Kumar's house.

486
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:06,592
''With friends like you,
who needs enemies?''

487
00:52:08,439 --> 00:52:10,600
How many years is it since
you've had a watermelon?

488
00:52:12,443 --> 00:52:15,606
Answer me! You're out of your mind.

489
00:52:15,946 --> 00:52:20,781
You just said there's a warrant in
his name. And l take him to SP's house?

490
00:52:21,785 --> 00:52:25,118
''He's a police officer,
but he's Rajesh's friend.''

491
00:52:26,290 --> 00:52:28,622
l see.

492
00:52:30,127 --> 00:52:34,791
''l get it! Very well, l'll take
a friend to his friend.''

493
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:39,132
This is a dangerous job.

494
00:52:41,305 --> 00:52:46,971
The word danger does not exist
in a Pathan's vocabulary.

495
00:52:47,144 --> 00:52:49,135
Go and fetch him.

496
00:52:49,813 --> 00:52:55,479
''ln the meantime, l'll fix
my dear Gulnar. Come on, baby!''

497
00:52:56,153 --> 00:52:58,144
Get started!

498
00:53:32,122 --> 00:53:34,613
My Gulnar sure jumps a lot.

499
00:53:35,292 --> 00:53:37,283
Does she bother you?

500
00:53:40,130 --> 00:53:42,121
Lie down on the sacks.

501
00:53:49,973 --> 00:53:52,806
Why must you endanger your life
for me?

502
00:53:53,477 --> 00:53:57,470
''Brother, what use is a life
that's of no use to another?''

503
00:53:58,148 --> 00:54:00,582
''But you don't even
know me, Sher Khan.''

504
00:54:01,084 --> 00:54:05,248
l don't know you but
l sure do know independence.

505
00:54:05,756 --> 00:54:07,747
l know what it means
to breathe freely.

506
00:54:08,258 --> 00:54:11,750
My truck is indeed blessed.

507
00:54:12,262 --> 00:54:16,096
There are many trucks in lndia
carrying bricks and stones.

508
00:54:16,767 --> 00:54:21,101
But only Sher Khan's lorry
carries freedom!

509
00:54:25,442 --> 00:54:28,775
My dear Motherland...

510
00:54:28,946 --> 00:54:32,109
''the garden l have
been separated from....''

511
00:54:32,282 --> 00:54:34,273
''for you, l will sacrifice myself''

512
00:54:35,619 --> 00:54:43,958
''You are my desire, my honor,
you are my life itself''

513
00:54:45,862 --> 00:54:51,801
''Like an affectionate mother,
you have embraced me''

514
00:54:52,336 --> 00:54:58,468
''l miss you, as l would
miss my little daughter''

515
00:54:58,909 --> 00:55:04,905
''As much as l miss you,
l am tormented...''

516
00:55:11,755 --> 00:55:13,746
''for you, l would sacrifice myself''

517
00:55:28,105 --> 00:55:29,595
Brother...

518
00:55:37,447 --> 00:55:41,110
Let me get off here.

519
00:55:42,953 --> 00:55:47,447
''Sher Khan unloads his goods only
at its destination, not on its way!''

520
00:55:48,125 --> 00:55:51,288
Why must you risk your life
in a fight for my country?

521
00:55:51,795 --> 00:55:55,128
Sher Khan has breathed
the air of this nation.

522
00:55:55,298 --> 00:55:59,792
l have drunk the water of its rivers
and fed on its foodgrains.

523
00:56:00,737 --> 00:56:04,901
This country doesn't become yours
only because you were born here!

524
00:56:07,611 --> 00:56:11,741
Sit back and relax. These few cops
can't stop Sher Khan's lorry!

525
00:56:14,251 --> 00:56:16,242
Allah be praised!

526
00:57:31,094 --> 00:57:35,758
''Good work, Gulnar! Let's take
another road to Ghazipur.''

527
00:57:52,949 --> 00:57:57,443
''Brother, your friend's house
is lit up all the way.''

528
00:58:05,061 --> 00:58:07,052
Take care.

529
00:58:11,067 --> 00:58:14,230
l've got you dinner.
Eat it up quietly.

530
00:58:15,071 --> 00:58:19,735
Why not? Don't feel shy.
l'm just an old woman.

531
00:58:22,913 --> 00:58:25,245
Where are you going?
Wait here for sometime.

532
00:58:25,415 --> 00:58:29,078
Are you mad? Go on.

533
00:59:03,553 --> 00:59:08,547
l have no experience
of nuptial nights.

534
00:59:08,892 --> 00:59:10,883
''lt's my first marriage, you see.''

535
00:59:15,899 --> 00:59:17,890
How could l forget?

536
00:59:18,068 --> 00:59:20,730
''How will l ask you to show me
your face, without giving you a gift?''

537
00:59:24,741 --> 00:59:26,732
You might laugh at me...

538
00:59:26,910 --> 00:59:32,746
but l'd like you to meet
my friend before meeting me.

539
00:59:34,584 --> 00:59:36,575
These are his works.

540
00:59:44,094 --> 00:59:48,758
''My life is pledged to him.
But my heart, l give to you.''

541
00:59:51,768 --> 00:59:56,762
One never knows whom one will meet
and under what circumstances.

542
00:59:58,108 --> 01:00:00,099
Maybe not ever.

543
01:00:00,777 --> 01:00:08,775
''But if we do meet, l'll marry
you in his presence again!''

544
01:00:20,797 --> 01:00:22,788
Who is it?

545
01:00:23,133 --> 01:00:25,124
Congratulations on your wedding!

546
01:00:25,969 --> 01:00:28,130
''Easy, my friend.''

547
01:00:29,806 --> 01:00:34,140
- You're wounded...
- Forget it...

548
01:00:40,150 --> 01:00:41,981
Won't you introduce us?

549
01:00:44,154 --> 01:00:45,644
Come on!

550
01:00:47,490 --> 01:00:52,325
l don't need your support
to meet her.

551
01:01:04,774 --> 01:01:07,265
l'm the dearest friend
your husband has.

552
01:01:09,879 --> 01:01:11,437
Won't you show me your face?

553
01:01:46,816 --> 01:01:49,808
Stop! Stop the truck!

554
01:01:50,820 --> 01:01:53,152
''What's the matter, constable?''

555
01:01:53,490 --> 01:01:55,151
Where are you coming from?

556
01:01:56,693 --> 01:01:58,160
Come to the police station.

557
01:02:01,431 --> 01:02:03,092
He's mad.

558
01:02:03,266 --> 01:02:06,758
Such a great poet and he's
on the run from the cops.

559
01:02:07,771 --> 01:02:10,262
Do you know him?
He's from Jaunpur too.

560
01:02:10,774 --> 01:02:12,765
l know his whole story.

561
01:02:13,777 --> 01:02:15,768
He was my neighbor.

562
01:02:18,281 --> 01:02:20,613
So you know him pretty well?

563
01:02:21,117 --> 01:02:24,951
''l do know him, but not very well.''

564
01:02:26,456 --> 01:02:30,119
My father works for the government
and this man works for Gandhi.

565
01:02:30,293 --> 01:02:32,784
So we couldn't meet often.

566
01:02:34,631 --> 01:02:41,469
''That's very nice. When l go on
duty, you can look after him.''

567
01:02:42,972 --> 01:02:46,806
lt's imperative he remains hidden
till he gets well.

568
01:02:47,811 --> 01:02:50,803
''No servant, nurse or doctor
must enter this room.''

569
01:02:51,815 --> 01:02:54,147
We'll have to be his nurse and doctor.

570
01:03:00,156 --> 01:03:02,090
How are you feeling now?

571
01:03:06,930 --> 01:03:08,921
How are you feeling now?

572
01:03:09,099 --> 01:03:11,260
l've always been fine.

573
01:03:11,434 --> 01:03:14,096
Why are you getting up?
Relax.

574
01:03:17,774 --> 01:03:22,108
''- No, l must leave.
- Have you gone out of your mind?''

575
01:03:22,212 --> 01:03:26,273
''How will you go? You'll stay
here, till you get better.''

576
01:03:27,450 --> 01:03:32,786
''You're too much. l was passing by,
and saw you were getting married.''

577
01:03:33,456 --> 01:03:36,448
l thought l'd wish you. And l did.

578
01:03:39,129 --> 01:03:43,623
Today is your nuptial night.
l don't want to disturb you.

579
01:03:45,135 --> 01:03:48,798
You're a real ass!

580
01:03:49,806 --> 01:03:52,969
ls the nuptial night more
important than our friendship?

581
01:03:56,646 --> 01:04:00,582
''Mr Superintendent,
you are a fool too.''

582
01:04:01,251 --> 01:04:03,242
Don't you know the cops
are on my trail?

583
01:04:03,586 --> 01:04:07,420
What? The cops are looking for you?

584
01:04:08,091 --> 01:04:11,583
How would l know?
l'm just an SP.

585
01:04:12,428 --> 01:04:16,262
Will my police come to my house
looking for you?

586
01:04:16,599 --> 01:04:18,590
''Whatever it is, l won't stay...''

587
01:04:22,272 --> 01:04:24,263
l won't stay here.

588
01:04:24,607 --> 01:04:27,098
Will you please reason
with this stubborn ass?

589
01:04:27,777 --> 01:04:32,111
''When he won't listen to you,
why will he listen to me?''

590
01:04:33,783 --> 01:04:35,774
Try telling him and see.

591
01:04:39,122 --> 01:04:43,286
''When my husband is insisting
so much, why don't you stay?''

592
01:04:44,961 --> 01:04:48,624
Try and refuse now!
Quietly go to sleep!

593
01:04:53,636 --> 01:04:57,629
- Where do l sleep?
- Right here. On this bed.

594
01:04:57,807 --> 01:05:00,742
- Have you gone mad?
- What's wrong with that?

595
01:05:01,244 --> 01:05:04,736
And... where will you go?

596
01:05:05,415 --> 01:05:10,250
We... we'll seek refuge
in each others' heart.

597
01:05:11,421 --> 01:05:17,417
Can you make some place for me
to live in your heart?

598
01:05:21,764 --> 01:05:25,097
Don't force me. l must leave.

599
01:05:25,201 --> 01:05:27,192
- What for?
- l can't tell.

600
01:05:27,270 --> 01:05:32,105
Then lie down quietly!
- My friends must be waiting for me!

601
01:05:32,775 --> 01:05:36,768
l am no enemy too.
- You won't understand.

602
01:05:38,781 --> 01:05:43,775
A friend's love can be more
disastrous than an enemy's wrath.

603
01:05:52,462 --> 01:05:55,795
Don't you cops
ever get tired?

604
01:05:56,132 --> 01:05:58,623
lt's midnight and you're
stuck on the same question!

605
01:05:59,135 --> 01:06:01,069
Give us the right answer and
the questions will end.

606
01:06:01,237 --> 01:06:03,728
''Where are your brains, l say?''

607
01:06:03,906 --> 01:06:06,568
''When l speak the truth,
you say l am lying!''

608
01:06:06,676 --> 01:06:09,406
And when l'm saying the right
thing you still think l'm lying!

609
01:06:10,413 --> 01:06:18,081
''Tell me, how will you know
when l'm lying and when l'm not.''

610
01:06:18,421 --> 01:06:20,753
''For God's sake, get lost!
And spare me!''

611
01:06:21,090 --> 01:06:23,752
Thank you sir.
We're rid of each other...

612
01:06:23,926 --> 01:06:25,917
One moment.

613
01:06:28,931 --> 01:06:32,594
''This is my prey, Constable.
What's your name?''

614
01:06:32,702 --> 01:06:35,262
- Who's he?
- What's your name?

615
01:06:35,938 --> 01:06:38,429
- My name will scare you.
- What is your name!!

616
01:06:39,776 --> 01:06:42,267
''Sher Khan, son of Jabbar Khan!''

617
01:06:42,612 --> 01:06:44,603
- Son of Babbar Khan!
- Shut up!

618
01:06:44,947 --> 01:06:47,609
Why did you speed away in the
lorry when l asked you to stop?

619
01:06:47,950 --> 01:06:51,113
Heavens! Was that you?

620
01:06:51,454 --> 01:06:54,116
''My truck sped away, not me!''

621
01:06:54,223 --> 01:06:57,784
My foot fell on the accelerator
instead of the brakes!

622
01:06:57,960 --> 01:07:01,555
Racing along brought back
memories of my childhood!

623
01:07:01,731 --> 01:07:05,724
''l said to myself, Sher Khan
will play with the police!''

624
01:07:05,835 --> 01:07:10,238
We have information that you
brought Rajesh in your truck!

625
01:07:10,340 --> 01:07:15,243
Where is he?
- Rajesh...? Rajesh who?

626
01:07:15,511 --> 01:07:20,244
The government has announced
a reward of 25000 for his arrest.

627
01:07:21,084 --> 01:07:23,746
That's a hell of a lot of money!
Will l get it?

628
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:25,251
Shut up!

629
01:07:25,421 --> 01:07:27,753
''Sir, he seems to be as crooked
as they come.''

630
01:07:28,091 --> 01:07:34,087
''Come back in the morning. By then,
he'll surely tell us where Rajesh is!''

631
01:07:34,597 --> 01:07:36,588
Constable! Take him away!

632
01:07:46,609 --> 01:07:48,099
Greetings.

633
01:07:48,211 --> 01:07:51,112
- Are you all Gandhi's men?
- Yes.

634
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:54,113
''By the grace of Allah,
you will all be freed.''

635
01:08:21,577 --> 01:08:24,740
Miyan must have brought the tea.
l'll open the door.

636
01:08:29,585 --> 01:08:31,576
Somebody is coming.
Cover yourself up.

637
01:08:34,424 --> 01:08:38,417
''Master...
Master, tea''

638
01:08:42,265 --> 01:08:44,426
''Good morning, lady.''

639
01:08:44,934 --> 01:08:47,926
- May l...?
- He's still asleep.

640
01:08:48,704 --> 01:08:50,695
No problem at all.

641
01:09:03,553 --> 01:09:05,544
Give it to me.

642
01:09:19,902 --> 01:09:21,893
Would you like some tea?

643
01:09:24,407 --> 01:09:26,398
Will you make some for me?

644
01:09:38,087 --> 01:09:44,253
A treat for you! The first cup
of tea made by my wife for you!

645
01:09:49,098 --> 01:09:52,932
''You must admit, l've sure pinched a
great piece from your neighborhood.''

646
01:09:55,605 --> 01:09:58,438
You're a poet.
Recite something for the moment.

647
01:10:04,614 --> 01:10:06,946
She is your partner in joy.

648
01:10:08,117 --> 01:10:10,278
She is your partner in sorrow.

649
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:15,284
God has willed it
that you have a bride.

650
01:10:19,462 --> 01:10:24,798
''These medicines are for major injuries,
not minor wounds.''

651
01:10:25,134 --> 01:10:27,796
Wounds of knife stabs or gunshots.

652
01:10:27,970 --> 01:10:31,804
There are riots in every city.

653
01:10:32,141 --> 01:10:34,473
The police are often the
victim of such riots.

654
01:10:34,810 --> 01:10:36,801
l'm taking these as a
precautionary measure.

655
01:10:44,153 --> 01:10:46,815
Take care of Rajesh.

656
01:10:47,490 --> 01:10:51,824
- Nobody must get anywhere close to him.
- l'll stop the other servants.

657
01:10:51,994 --> 01:10:53,985
How do l put Aunt Leela off?

658
01:10:54,830 --> 01:10:56,821
''Be firm, if you have to.''

659
01:10:57,166 --> 01:11:01,432
''lf possible, clean the room yourself.''

660
01:11:01,604 --> 01:11:04,767
But what will the servants think?

661
01:11:05,107 --> 01:11:10,443
Let them think what they will.
But we must save Rajesh.

662
01:11:10,780 --> 01:11:13,442
Why don't you send him
to a safer place?

663
01:11:14,450 --> 01:11:19,114
''Actually, no place is safer for him
than this house.''

664
01:11:20,790 --> 01:11:27,286
''Remember, if Rajesh is caught
on account of a mistake we make...''

665
01:11:28,464 --> 01:11:31,126
he will surely be hanged.

666
01:11:46,148 --> 01:11:48,139
Good news before you go in.

667
01:11:49,251 --> 01:11:53,813
''The truck driver who brought Rajesh,
the revolutionary here, is arrested!''

668
01:11:54,824 --> 01:11:59,318
We are sure he will soon
tell us where Rajesh is.

669
01:12:01,764 --> 01:12:05,757
Then l'll become an
inspector from a constable.

670
01:12:09,171 --> 01:12:11,935
You guys are funny!

671
01:12:12,108 --> 01:12:18,274
''l don't know any Rajesh, l say!
l sell almonds, pistachios!''

672
01:12:18,381 --> 01:12:20,440
And asafoetida and nuts.

673
01:12:20,616 --> 01:12:24,609
Have you eaten nuts?
lt would set your brains right!

674
01:12:25,121 --> 01:12:29,455
A friend told me to sell opium.
l'd make more money.

675
01:12:29,625 --> 01:12:31,616
l tried that and got caught!

676
01:12:32,795 --> 01:12:35,286
The jail in Lahore was better
than this one.

677
01:12:35,464 --> 01:12:38,956
lt was airy.
Not as hot as it is here!

678
01:12:39,635 --> 01:12:41,626
Now is when you're going
to feel the real heat.

679
01:12:41,971 --> 01:12:46,135
- Where is Rajesh?
- There you go again!

680
01:12:46,475 --> 01:12:49,967
Atleast describe him to me.
Who is Rajesh?

681
01:12:50,146 --> 01:12:55,812
''Now look, Sher Khan.
Our SP is a merciful man.''

682
01:12:55,985 --> 01:12:58,818
''So you are the SP, are you?''

683
01:13:01,757 --> 01:13:05,420
You are the SP who will
bless me with a reward?

684
01:13:13,602 --> 01:13:20,770
''My elder brother's name was
Nihaluddin, the loyal too.''

685
01:13:32,788 --> 01:13:36,451
This guy appears to be a nut.
He can't be our man.

686
01:13:36,625 --> 01:13:39,116
''He's a tough nut, sir.''

687
01:13:40,129 --> 01:13:45,123
A little bit of kneading and
he'll sing like a bird.

688
01:13:49,138 --> 01:13:51,800
Do you recall where Rajesh is?

689
01:13:56,145 --> 01:14:00,411
''Constable, l'm a Pathan.''

690
01:14:01,083 --> 01:14:05,918
''See that, sir? One kick,
and he speaks clearly.''

691
01:14:10,092 --> 01:14:14,256
Untie my hands for a minute.

692
01:14:15,097 --> 01:14:20,763
''l swear it on Allah, l'll teach you
many languages in just one kick.''

693
01:14:22,271 --> 01:14:24,262
Where is Rajesh?

694
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:30,606
l'm a Pathan! lf l once said
l don't know where Rajesh is...

695
01:14:30,780 --> 01:14:33,112
''l swear it on God, l don't know!''

696
01:14:39,288 --> 01:14:43,281
''Sir, may l start skinning him alive?''

697
01:14:44,126 --> 01:14:46,959
No... No.

698
01:14:48,798 --> 01:14:52,290
Lock him up for the time being.

699
01:15:08,417 --> 01:15:13,252
l'd never have come here if l knew
you were Dheeraj's wife.

700
01:15:15,758 --> 01:15:19,250
- But you know now.
- But what will l tell Dheeraj?

701
01:15:20,095 --> 01:15:22,086
He won't settle for anything
but the truth.

702
01:15:22,431 --> 01:15:25,764
And l can't tell him the truth.

703
01:15:29,271 --> 01:15:31,262
But you needn't worry.

704
01:15:33,108 --> 01:15:35,770
l'll find a way to
get out of here.

705
01:15:37,112 --> 01:15:42,106
Why must you leave? lt's your
friend's house. So stay on.

706
01:15:42,785 --> 01:15:46,619
How will l?
lt bothers you.

707
01:15:47,790 --> 01:15:51,282
Since when have you started
worrying about others?

708
01:15:53,796 --> 01:15:58,290
''Look mister, you are
my husband's friend.''

709
01:15:59,134 --> 01:16:03,070
And l am your friend's wife.

710
01:16:05,074 --> 01:16:07,736
That's the only relation we share.

711
01:16:09,245 --> 01:16:14,740
''You are welcome to stay here,
but the day l suspect...''

712
01:16:15,751 --> 01:16:17,912
that you are a risk to him...

713
01:16:18,921 --> 01:16:22,413
l will hand you over
to the police on my own.

714
01:16:42,841 --> 01:16:46,675
This silence is killing
with a poet around.

715
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:50,840
Recite something.

716
01:17:05,864 --> 01:17:07,024
What are you doing?

717
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:09,861
Darkness.
- What for?

718
01:17:11,703 --> 01:17:13,864
To make the setting perfect
for poetry.

719
01:17:21,379 --> 01:17:25,372
''l wandered in darkness,
all my life...''

720
01:17:27,552 --> 01:17:31,989
''where did the Moon show up from,
showing me its light?''

721
01:17:36,995 --> 01:17:38,986
The moon has risen now.

722
01:17:39,664 --> 01:17:41,825
''Recite something now, my friend.''

723
01:17:43,668 --> 01:17:46,660
What can l say?
l've forgotten all my couplets.

724
01:17:47,672 --> 01:17:49,663
''ln that case, recite something
on forgetting.''

725
01:17:51,510 --> 01:17:54,343
Wow! What a beautiful request!

726
01:17:56,348 --> 01:18:00,341
The flame and the firefly are here.

727
01:18:01,019 --> 01:18:03,180
And there is my bride's request.

728
01:18:05,690 --> 01:18:09,683
''The firefly burnt to ashes
in a flash''

729
01:18:10,028 --> 01:18:13,691
''The flame has to but
burn all night''

730
01:18:13,965 --> 01:18:20,529
''Wonderful! You must admit,
poets do have a way with words.''

731
01:18:22,374 --> 01:18:25,036
That's it. They can only talk.

732
01:18:27,879 --> 01:18:30,973
Did you hear that?
She hurt you all right.

733
01:18:31,249 --> 01:18:34,810
lt has nothing to do with hurting.
What does writing involve anyway?

734
01:18:35,654 --> 01:18:38,487
Pull out a plain paper
and write something.

735
01:18:40,425 --> 01:18:41,824
But what did he write?

736
01:18:42,093 --> 01:18:45,153
That which is hidden
in the poet's heart.

737
01:18:47,332 --> 01:18:50,165
And what's hidden in your heart?
Tonight you must open up.

738
01:18:52,337 --> 01:18:54,999
''l asked to be punished
with separation''

739
01:18:55,340 --> 01:18:58,332
''That's about the only bad thing
l did''

740
01:18:58,677 --> 01:19:03,512
''You tell me tales of loyalty.
l've been unfaithful anyway''

741
01:19:04,349 --> 01:19:08,683
Wonderful! A hundred
loyalties for your poem!

742
01:19:09,020 --> 01:19:12,353
For the first time l hear cruelty
being praised.

743
01:19:13,358 --> 01:19:17,522
''He praises cruelty,
appreciates disloyalty''

744
01:19:18,029 --> 01:19:22,363
''What people are these who
appreciate the disloyal!''

745
01:19:25,370 --> 01:19:27,361
That's something!
What do you say?

746
01:19:28,373 --> 01:19:31,968
''Those who are not loyal,
appreciate loyalty''

747
01:19:32,477 --> 01:19:36,311
''lt's those who do not believe,
that truly appreciate God''

748
01:19:37,315 --> 01:19:41,809
''All creation sheds tears.
Don't even talk about Him''

749
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:46,484
''Take my life if you will,
but do not talk about loyalty ever''

750
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:50,990
My wife is like a sharp-edged sword.

751
01:19:52,664 --> 01:19:54,655
You're in trouble today!

752
01:19:56,501 --> 01:19:58,492
l think you must accept defeat.

753
01:19:59,004 --> 01:20:03,338
Poetry begins only
after you accept defeat.

754
01:20:03,675 --> 01:20:07,839
''lf you look at it carefully,
loyalty is wrongly defined.''

755
01:20:08,346 --> 01:20:13,511
''Like love, loyalty is not
forced, it just happens.''

756
01:20:16,021 --> 01:20:19,855
Why must one shed tears
in the name of loyalty?

757
01:20:20,358 --> 01:20:24,692
Ask those who swallow their tears
what loyalty really is!

758
01:20:25,530 --> 01:20:30,524
''Well said! Bride dear,
do you have an answer to that?''

759
01:20:30,802 --> 01:20:35,296
''There is loyalty on his lips,
and disloyalty in his heart.''

760
01:20:35,807 --> 01:20:39,971
''But the one whose world you
destroyed, still blesses you.''

761
01:20:40,645 --> 01:20:47,642
What you say is perhaps right

762
01:20:49,154 --> 01:20:55,821
''l am indeed
insensitive and unfaithful''

763
01:20:57,329 --> 01:21:02,665
Do leave me and go away

764
01:21:03,335 --> 01:21:08,170
When you pluck the rose...

765
01:21:10,342 --> 01:21:13,505
pluck it with care

766
01:21:16,848 --> 01:21:19,681
Gently pluck the rose...

767
01:21:20,685 --> 01:21:25,179
for roses are delicate

768
01:21:35,633 --> 01:21:41,469
''ln any case, they are unfortunate
to blossom among thorns''

769
01:21:41,639 --> 01:21:43,971
Gently pluck...

770
01:21:44,743 --> 01:21:47,974
Gently pluck the rose...

771
01:21:48,646 --> 01:21:53,310
for roses are delicate

772
01:22:20,678 --> 01:22:25,843
You do have a lovely little grouse

773
01:22:31,956 --> 01:22:37,451
But isn't it unjustified too?

774
01:22:37,796 --> 01:22:42,961
Those who always hurt people...

775
01:22:43,501 --> 01:22:48,632
''say this when they are
themselves hurt...''

776
01:22:49,307 --> 01:22:51,298
they say...

777
01:22:51,810 --> 01:22:53,971
Gently...

778
01:22:55,980 --> 01:23:03,318
''gently pluck the rose,
for it's very delicate''

779
01:23:04,656 --> 01:23:10,322
''The ones who make people weep
eventually cry one day''

780
01:23:10,662 --> 01:23:13,825
''The rose...
- ''pluck it gently...''

781
01:23:14,666 --> 01:23:19,000
for roses are delicate

782
01:23:20,505 --> 01:23:26,341
''They hurt not, they are
the ones that are hurt''

783
01:23:26,444 --> 01:23:29,504
Pluck the rose gently

784
01:23:47,298 --> 01:23:52,463
''You do have sympathies
for the beauty of the rose''

785
01:23:58,743 --> 01:24:04,147
''And why not?
You're a man too''

786
01:24:04,549 --> 01:24:09,486
''One answer for a
thousand questions...''

787
01:24:09,988 --> 01:24:14,823
let not the eyes deceive you

788
01:24:18,329 --> 01:24:20,320
Pluck the rose gently

789
01:24:25,336 --> 01:24:27,327
Wonderful!

790
01:24:33,778 --> 01:24:38,272
You are a servant of
the British government.

791
01:24:39,117 --> 01:24:44,453
Just do your duty without
caring about SP's or DlG's.

792
01:24:47,625 --> 01:24:49,616
What are you thinking about?

793
01:24:51,629 --> 01:24:53,790
l'm a terrible man.

794
01:24:54,465 --> 01:24:59,459
There was this man who broke police
barricades to bring me here...

795
01:24:59,637 --> 01:25:01,628
and l didn't even
ask anything about him.

796
01:25:01,806 --> 01:25:04,297
And the ass who can tell me
is sitting in front of me.

797
01:25:04,642 --> 01:25:08,134
Has a man called
Sher Khan been arrested?

798
01:25:14,319 --> 01:25:18,653
l am the SP here.

799
01:25:18,823 --> 01:25:21,314
''lf he was arrested,
l'd be the first to know.''

800
01:25:23,828 --> 01:25:26,820
Just don't worry.
He must have gotten home by now.

801
01:25:27,999 --> 01:25:31,093
''ln your lifetime, you've done
just one sensible thing.''

802
01:25:32,270 --> 01:25:34,932
- What is that?
- Joining the police.

803
01:25:45,617 --> 01:25:48,780
Hold it.
Where did you leave Rajesh?

804
01:25:52,290 --> 01:25:54,281
''Rajesh, who?''

805
01:26:12,310 --> 01:26:14,301
Since when has this
been going on?

806
01:26:15,647 --> 01:26:20,812
lt's been about 45 minutes.

807
01:26:29,661 --> 01:26:31,993
He would've told us long ago
if he knew.

808
01:26:32,830 --> 01:26:35,321
''After such a thrashing,
no man can keep quiet.''

809
01:26:38,670 --> 01:26:43,835
''Constable, l hope you're not
under some misunderstanding.''

810
01:26:44,342 --> 01:26:46,833
''He knows everything, sir.''

811
01:26:47,178 --> 01:26:49,339
And he will tell all!

812
01:26:52,350 --> 01:26:54,841
lt doesn't appear as if
the thrashing will help.

813
01:26:56,354 --> 01:27:01,348
- Give him some time to think.
- Think about what? He'll talk now.

814
01:27:01,693 --> 01:27:04,025
Get the salt.

815
01:27:17,709 --> 01:27:21,042
My plight reminds me of a couplet.

816
01:27:23,214 --> 01:27:25,205
Would you like to hear it?

817
01:27:27,719 --> 01:27:32,816
''With a pinch of salt,
and a dagger in hand..''

818
01:27:33,658 --> 01:27:38,994
he wishes that l'd hand him
my wounded heart!

819
01:27:42,333 --> 01:27:44,324
Don't you understand... ?

820
01:27:46,337 --> 01:27:49,329
- You don't.
- l'll explain right now.

821
01:28:00,685 --> 01:28:05,850
''Remember, it's important for him
to live in order to speak.''

822
01:28:06,090 --> 01:28:11,357
''Don't worry, sir. He will
live and he will speak.''

823
01:28:41,325 --> 01:28:43,316
''- Who is it?
- Madam, it's me.''

824
01:28:43,661 --> 01:28:45,652
Come in.

825
01:28:54,172 --> 01:28:56,663
- What are you doing there?
- Drawing the curtains.

826
01:28:56,774 --> 01:28:59,004
Stop it!
Shut it.

827
01:29:01,179 --> 01:29:03,170
Take the plates and leave.

828
01:29:20,198 --> 01:29:24,692
My stay here is probably
dangerous for Dheeraj.

829
01:29:24,802 --> 01:29:26,793
So go away.

830
01:29:28,539 --> 01:29:30,530
- l will leave.
- When?

831
01:29:30,975 --> 01:29:34,308
After slipping the
noose round his neck?

832
01:29:34,979 --> 01:29:37,311
After destroying my home?

833
01:29:37,648 --> 01:29:39,639
Or before that?

834
01:29:41,319 --> 01:29:44,482
You broke my heart.
And l didn't say a word.

835
01:29:44,822 --> 01:29:47,313
But l won't let you break my home.

836
01:29:47,658 --> 01:29:52,322
Nobody could be a worse enemy
than the friend you are!

837
01:30:07,178 --> 01:30:11,512
''After the 1857 revolt, it's the same
situation in Ghazipur all over again.''

838
01:30:11,849 --> 01:30:15,250
''With your permission,
l'll impose restrictions...''

839
01:30:15,353 --> 01:30:17,344
impose curfew or order firing..?

840
01:30:17,521 --> 01:30:20,183
Sing for them. What's the harm?

841
01:30:28,866 --> 01:30:32,131
l feel shy...

842
01:30:33,304 --> 01:30:37,968
to say it

843
01:30:39,644 --> 01:30:46,482
''lt's a new house
for the bride''

844
01:30:50,655 --> 01:30:58,494
lt's a riddle...

845
01:31:00,331 --> 01:31:06,327
let it remain a mystery

846
01:31:07,672 --> 01:31:13,008
''This is what my love story
is all about...''

847
01:31:13,344 --> 01:31:18,680
''like water being drawn away
from the river''

848
01:31:19,350 --> 01:31:24,344
''like water being
separated from the river''

849
01:32:02,660 --> 01:32:08,656
''The bride must leave
her parents' house...''

850
01:32:08,766 --> 01:32:13,328
marriage takes her far away

851
01:32:13,671 --> 01:32:18,836
When roses blossom...

852
01:32:19,343 --> 01:32:24,178
they are plucked by people

853
01:32:25,016 --> 01:32:30,511
''A King brought me here
as his Queen''

854
01:32:30,788 --> 01:32:36,283
''Like water being separated
from the river''

855
01:32:59,517 --> 01:33:04,978
''Winding its way through
so many lanes...''

856
01:33:05,322 --> 01:33:10,157
''my husband arrived
in a bridal procession''

857
01:33:10,661 --> 01:33:15,655
My friends were all separated...

858
01:33:16,333 --> 01:33:21,168
''l only carried their memories
with me''

859
01:33:21,839 --> 01:33:27,334
''The tears that flow are
in their remembrance...''

860
01:33:27,678 --> 01:33:32,945
''it's like water being
separated from the river''

861
01:34:00,978 --> 01:34:06,644
''The songs l sang
in my mother's house...''

862
01:34:06,750 --> 01:34:11,312
l now remember

863
01:34:11,989 --> 01:34:16,653
''Just as l remember
my foes...''

864
01:34:17,328 --> 01:34:22,163
l miss those l loved

865
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:28,336
''Whenever will these memories
be erased...''

866
01:34:28,506 --> 01:34:33,773
''it's like water being
drawn away from the river''

867
01:34:39,950 --> 01:34:44,284
''This is just what my love story
is all about''

868
01:34:44,955 --> 01:34:50,450
''lt's like water being
drawn away from the river''

869
01:35:09,313 --> 01:35:11,304
l'm beginning to fall
in love with you.

870
01:35:55,292 --> 01:35:57,283
Where could the rascal have gone?

871
01:35:58,128 --> 01:36:03,794
''lf you can risk your life for him,
can't he go away for your sake?''

872
01:36:04,802 --> 01:36:07,635
That was one way of being a friend.

873
01:36:08,305 --> 01:36:12,799
And what he did is another.

874
01:36:13,811 --> 01:36:16,302
Let him repay his dues
as a friend.

875
01:36:21,318 --> 01:36:24,310
Nobody can ever repay
dues as a friend.

876
01:36:49,013 --> 01:36:51,004
''Stop there, Rajesh!''

877
01:37:01,191 --> 01:37:04,024
What are you looking at?
Let's go home.

878
01:37:04,128 --> 01:37:06,119
''You don't understand, Dheeraj.
lt's best that l leave.''

879
01:37:06,196 --> 01:37:08,858
l don't want to place you at risk!
- Don't be stupid!

880
01:37:08,966 --> 01:37:11,025
Why did you come to my house
if you didn't want me put at risk?

881
01:37:11,702 --> 01:37:13,693
You act like a revolutionary!

882
01:37:13,804 --> 01:37:16,364
As if the parcel of independence
will come only to your address!

883
01:37:16,707 --> 01:37:19,540
Quietly sit in the car or
you can't get out of here.

884
01:37:19,710 --> 01:37:21,701
l'm not going.

885
01:37:23,714 --> 01:37:27,548
All right. l'll come with you.

886
01:37:27,718 --> 01:37:29,709
''- Are you mad?
- Yes, l am!''

887
01:37:29,887 --> 01:37:32,822
Either you come with me
or l'll come with you.

888
01:37:44,668 --> 01:37:47,000
''- Sir... ?
- Yes, constable.''

889
01:37:47,104 --> 01:37:49,834
- What are you doing here?
- l have a problem with the light

890
01:37:50,007 --> 01:37:51,998
l came to take a look
at your arrangements.

891
01:37:52,176 --> 01:37:55,168
''Any news of Rajesh?
- He is in this very city, sir.''

892
01:37:55,346 --> 01:37:58,179
So why aren't you arresting him?
The police are getting a bad name.

893
01:38:02,353 --> 01:38:04,344
Good night constable.

894
01:38:13,364 --> 01:38:17,198
Moron! How did you suddenly
think of leaving?

895
01:38:23,374 --> 01:38:27,037
You want me to tell you the truth?
- Yes.

896
01:38:29,713 --> 01:38:31,977
l didn't want to be a spoilsport.

897
01:38:33,650 --> 01:38:35,811
And l'm fed up of life anyway.

898
01:38:37,321 --> 01:38:42,816
l fell into deep contemplation
on seeing your loving lives.

899
01:38:43,660 --> 01:38:45,651
What is the point of my life?

900
01:38:47,498 --> 01:38:49,489
Maybe there's no meaning at all.

901
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:56,166
A life full of love
can't be meaningless.

902
01:38:56,840 --> 01:38:59,331
''But that story ended
long ago, my friend.''

903
01:39:04,681 --> 01:39:07,844
Why? Did the girl ditch you?

904
01:39:12,689 --> 01:39:14,680
l cheated her.

905
01:39:17,361 --> 01:39:19,352
You...?

906
01:39:24,034 --> 01:39:28,368
Here's your neighbor. Today
he escaped being bashed up by me.

907
01:39:29,706 --> 01:39:32,971
''You're smiling? You pig,
twerp, scoundrel!''

908
01:39:33,076 --> 01:39:35,306
You louse! Do you hear his praise?

909
01:39:35,479 --> 01:39:38,642
Cast a curtain on the friendship.
His vices too will be under wraps.

910
01:39:40,083 --> 01:39:45,316
- You mete out justice now.
- Why involve her?

911
01:39:45,489 --> 01:39:47,980
Why not? She has to play the judge.

912
01:39:48,325 --> 01:39:50,316
And l'll be the lawyer.

913
01:39:50,661 --> 01:39:53,152
The case is of the girl you cheated.

914
01:39:56,667 --> 01:40:00,330
And you will have to
accept her decision!

915
01:40:01,672 --> 01:40:03,663
Excuse me.

916
01:40:04,007 --> 01:40:05,998
l don't want to interfere
between friends.

917
01:40:06,176 --> 01:40:10,340
Don't you sympathize with
the girl he ditched?

918
01:40:12,850 --> 01:40:15,512
l can't be the judge because
l am sympathetic to her.

919
01:40:16,687 --> 01:40:20,179
''lf l am not fair,
you will complain.''

920
01:40:21,358 --> 01:40:23,349
l have full confidence in you.

921
01:40:32,302 --> 01:40:34,964
Sit here and listen carefully.

922
01:40:36,473 --> 01:40:39,306
Maybe you will hear the sound
of the girl's heart breaking.

923
01:40:40,310 --> 01:40:44,804
''Honorable Judge, he is
accused of loving a girl.''

924
01:40:45,148 --> 01:40:47,309
But he was not true to her.

925
01:40:49,653 --> 01:40:53,316
The path to my nation
is as important as hers...

926
01:40:53,657 --> 01:40:56,990
''When it came to a matter of choice,
l turned that way.''

927
01:41:02,666 --> 01:41:08,332
Does serving the nation mean
a man must betray his love?

928
01:41:08,672 --> 01:41:11,835
Did she ever tell you not to
participate in the freedom struggle?

929
01:41:12,342 --> 01:41:16,676
Don't fool yourself in the belief that
you made a sacrifice for your nation!

930
01:41:16,847 --> 01:41:18,838
You have not made any sacrifice!

931
01:41:18,949 --> 01:41:21,179
''ln plain words, you have cheated her!''

932
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:25,511
What happened to the girl?

933
01:41:28,258 --> 01:41:30,522
What happened to the girl?

934
01:41:34,464 --> 01:41:38,127
She... got married.

935
01:41:39,303 --> 01:41:41,794
ls she happy with the marriage?

936
01:41:46,977 --> 01:41:48,308
l don't know.

937
01:41:48,645 --> 01:41:50,636
There's no question
of her being happy.

938
01:41:51,748 --> 01:41:55,309
''When an lndian girl falls in love,
she's faithful all her life!''

939
01:41:55,652 --> 01:42:00,817
''No, sir. When an lndian
girl gets married...''

940
01:42:01,325 --> 01:42:03,657
it is for keeps.

941
01:42:10,667 --> 01:42:14,330
- This is no decision.
- The decision is clear.

942
01:42:15,505 --> 01:42:19,498
You should have been
honest with her.

943
01:42:20,344 --> 01:42:23,836
''Possibly, she might have
preferred to be your widow...''

944
01:42:24,348 --> 01:42:27,340
rather than somebody's wife.

945
01:42:39,129 --> 01:42:43,623
''l said nothing,
and still expressed so much''

946
01:42:43,800 --> 01:42:48,635
l couldn't speak a word

947
01:42:53,977 --> 01:42:58,641
That which l couldn't talk about...

948
01:42:58,982 --> 01:43:03,316
my eyes expressed

949
01:44:06,650 --> 01:44:09,312
lt's raining cats and dogs!

950
01:44:10,654 --> 01:44:12,986
How did you get drenched?

951
01:44:13,323 --> 01:44:16,156
At the window. You're back early.

952
01:44:16,827 --> 01:44:23,665
ls this the season to be with
thieves or drink tea with you?

953
01:44:23,834 --> 01:44:25,665
And chat up with Rajesh.

954
01:44:26,336 --> 01:44:28,668
''lt's stuffy in here,
l'll open the window.''

955
01:44:29,673 --> 01:44:32,437
''Of course, you'll feel stuffy.
You've been in this room for so long.''

956
01:44:33,276 --> 01:44:36,768
And this lovely weather!
Let's do one thing.

957
01:44:37,781 --> 01:44:41,444
Go for a long drive with Rajesh.

958
01:44:42,786 --> 01:44:45,448
- What do you say?
- You are out of your mind.

959
01:44:45,622 --> 01:44:49,285
The cops are looking for me
and you're planning drives!

960
01:44:49,626 --> 01:44:52,618
l'm a cop.
l think before speaking.

961
01:44:53,463 --> 01:44:55,454
l'll send you in a camouflage.

962
01:44:55,632 --> 01:44:59,625
Wear this and come on.

963
01:45:01,304 --> 01:45:03,636
Doesn't he look like me?

964
01:45:07,310 --> 01:45:09,471
''Whether l look like you or not,
l'm not going.''

965
01:45:10,647 --> 01:45:12,808
Make this nincompoop see reason!

966
01:45:12,983 --> 01:45:14,974
Please don't drag me in your fights.

967
01:45:21,158 --> 01:45:24,321
Why don't you come when
he is insisting so much?

968
01:45:24,828 --> 01:45:27,160
Hear that? That's the spirit!

969
01:45:27,664 --> 01:45:29,655
There's nobody to compare with her!

970
01:45:29,833 --> 01:45:34,099
''After you, if there is anyone
l have loved, it is her.''

971
01:45:34,604 --> 01:45:38,597
You come along too. lt's been
ages since we went out together.

972
01:45:38,775 --> 01:45:42,609
You must talk like a fool!
l can go whenever l wish.

973
01:45:42,779 --> 01:45:44,610
And you can only go today.

974
01:45:44,781 --> 01:45:47,272
''Hidden under this raincoat,
in this weather...''

975
01:45:47,617 --> 01:45:52,782
''when you go out, people will think
Dheeraj and his wife are out.''

976
01:45:52,956 --> 01:45:56,289
Hurry. You can't go
if it stops raining.

977
01:45:56,626 --> 01:45:58,958
Such opportunities don't come often.

978
01:46:05,302 --> 01:46:08,294
Don't think. Just march out.

979
01:46:12,475 --> 01:46:15,808
''lf you walk a mile away, the servants
will be the first to suspect.''

980
01:46:16,146 --> 01:46:18,137
Walk like this.

981
01:46:18,982 --> 01:46:20,973
As if it is my wife and me.

982
01:46:30,260 --> 01:46:34,321
''Constable, are you buying these
medicines for fear of rioting?''

983
01:46:35,832 --> 01:46:39,825
Your SP too bought them
sometime back.

984
01:46:40,170 --> 01:46:42,161
The SP took these?

985
01:46:42,339 --> 01:46:45,672
But why would he need them?

986
01:46:46,009 --> 01:46:48,170
The civil surgeon
has asked for them.

987
01:46:48,278 --> 01:46:50,838
The wound of a prisoner
is infected by a bullet.

988
01:46:50,947 --> 01:46:53,347
- To treat him.
- Maybe.

989
01:47:42,432 --> 01:47:48,337
lt's always a small spark...

990
01:47:54,678 --> 01:48:00,173
''that burns and blows
the world asunder''

991
01:48:00,550 --> 01:48:02,848
ln the rains...

992
01:48:03,019 --> 01:48:05,852
there are clouds...

993
01:48:06,022 --> 01:48:08,684
and there is lightning...

994
01:48:09,025 --> 01:48:14,361
They long... and it pours

995
01:48:15,565 --> 01:48:17,692
ln a love story...

996
01:48:18,034 --> 01:48:20,366
there's a boy...

997
01:48:20,870 --> 01:48:23,361
and there's a girl

998
01:48:23,873 --> 01:48:29,539
''They laugh,
they cry''

999
01:48:57,073 --> 01:49:02,670
''- Shall l get some tea for you?
- No, don't bother.''

1000
01:49:11,688 --> 01:49:13,679
That reminds me...

1001
01:49:13,857 --> 01:49:18,351
who's injured that the officer
bought medicines at the chemist shop?

1002
01:49:18,695 --> 01:49:22,358
Nobody's injured.

1003
01:49:27,370 --> 01:49:28,701
l think my master is here.

1004
01:49:38,815 --> 01:49:41,147
You are wet. Change your clothes.

1005
01:49:44,654 --> 01:49:51,321
''The day l took over, l made it clear
l hate people coming over to my house.''

1006
01:49:51,494 --> 01:49:54,486
''Sorry, but the Collector has ordered..''

1007
01:49:54,664 --> 01:49:57,326
His Lordship is coming for
the war front celebrations.

1008
01:49:57,434 --> 01:50:00,665
lt is important that Rajesh
be arrested before that.

1009
01:50:02,338 --> 01:50:09,176
Since when has the Collector started
issuing orders to my subordinates?

1010
01:50:10,680 --> 01:50:13,342
lt's no joke to arrest Rajesh!

1011
01:50:14,517 --> 01:50:18,180
- Any orders for me?
- Wait right here.

1012
01:50:35,638 --> 01:50:39,802
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. Just dizzy.

1013
01:50:42,145 --> 01:50:44,978
- What's wrong?
- Felt dizzy.

1014
01:50:46,149 --> 01:50:52,315
Has the constable left?
- He won't budge.

1015
01:50:52,655 --> 01:50:54,646
l'll get rid of him.

1016
01:50:58,995 --> 01:51:03,830
We can't fix a date
for Rajesh's arrest.

1017
01:51:04,667 --> 01:51:09,331
And l think he must have
left town by now.

1018
01:51:09,439 --> 01:51:12,340
''No, he's very much here.''

1019
01:51:14,344 --> 01:51:17,507
- So why can't he be found?
- He'll soon be.

1020
01:51:17,680 --> 01:51:20,513
''Take a seat, sir. l'll explain.''

1021
01:51:22,685 --> 01:51:25,347
The entire city has been sealed.

1022
01:51:25,522 --> 01:51:27,854
From Cotton Market
to Nawapura Ghat.

1023
01:51:27,957 --> 01:51:30,517
And the Mishra Bazaar.
The entire area has been combed.

1024
01:51:30,793 --> 01:51:35,287
Only this area remains.

1025
01:51:35,398 --> 01:51:38,299
These are the civil lines.
The Government officials live here.

1026
01:51:38,635 --> 01:51:42,799
Are you implying that a civil
official has given him refuge?

1027
01:51:44,307 --> 01:51:46,468
Anything is possible nowadays.

1028
01:51:50,313 --> 01:51:54,306
All lndian officers are not
strong allies of the British.

1029
01:51:58,321 --> 01:52:02,985
lf we start searching the
homes of lndian officials...

1030
01:52:03,326 --> 01:52:05,317
matters will get worse.

1031
01:52:05,495 --> 01:52:08,658
When their loyalties
are being questioned...

1032
01:52:08,765 --> 01:52:11,825
it'll lead to a feeling of resentment.

1033
01:52:22,512 --> 01:52:24,503
We'll do as you wish.

1034
01:52:24,847 --> 01:52:27,338
Let's begin searching
official bungalows.

1035
01:52:27,684 --> 01:52:29,675
Starting with mine.

1036
01:52:30,687 --> 01:52:32,621
Then yours.

1037
01:52:32,722 --> 01:52:36,954
''Next their quarters. lt's okay if
Rajesh is found. Else, l'll resign.''

1038
01:52:43,633 --> 01:52:45,624
Don't go to such extremes.

1039
01:52:45,969 --> 01:52:49,962
Sher Khan is about to confess.

1040
01:52:50,306 --> 01:52:54,800
lf he tells us where Rajesh is...

1041
01:52:54,911 --> 01:52:58,312
all our worries will end.

1042
01:53:30,680 --> 01:53:34,776
Why have l been called here?
- l think he's about to confess.

1043
01:53:50,300 --> 01:53:58,298
''Sir, l would confess
if l were dead.''

1044
01:53:59,475 --> 01:54:01,807
But l am still alive.

1045
01:54:02,645 --> 01:54:05,478
My conscience lives.

1046
01:54:07,817 --> 01:54:10,980
l haven't spoken. Nor will l ever.

1047
01:54:14,157 --> 01:54:21,325
''Look, till you talk...
nobody's going to let you go.''

1048
01:54:22,665 --> 01:54:25,998
Don't forget that these orders
have come from above.

1049
01:54:28,171 --> 01:54:30,765
l too have got orders from above.

1050
01:54:31,941 --> 01:54:35,604
l have been asked to remain silent.

1051
01:54:44,620 --> 01:54:47,111
Rajesh will be arrested
sooner or later.

1052
01:54:50,960 --> 01:54:53,622
What is the point of
bearing such pain?

1053
01:54:57,734 --> 01:54:59,793
l'm no shopkeeper.

1054
01:55:00,803 --> 01:55:02,464
l can't think in terms
of profit and loss.

1055
01:55:02,739 --> 01:55:04,969
Why do you want to give up
your life for Rajesh?

1056
01:55:05,308 --> 01:55:07,299
What's so special about that?

1057
01:55:11,647 --> 01:55:16,141
This is what my life lies in.

1058
01:55:16,486 --> 01:55:19,819
''Moron, why did you ask for the SP
when you weren't going to talk?''

1059
01:55:23,326 --> 01:55:28,821
Thank the Lord
l don't have a sister.

1060
01:55:29,665 --> 01:55:33,260
Or l'd have killed you
even in this state!

1061
01:55:35,772 --> 01:55:37,933
Send this dog away!

1062
01:55:38,441 --> 01:55:40,432
Then l will talk to you.

1063
01:55:41,944 --> 01:55:43,935
''Go away, everybody.''

1064
01:55:54,624 --> 01:56:01,462
l have called you because..

1065
01:56:03,299 --> 01:56:08,635
...now l can't keep quiet.

1066
01:56:11,641 --> 01:56:15,304
Send Rajesh away from your house.

1067
01:56:16,813 --> 01:56:18,804
And then kill me.

1068
01:56:25,488 --> 01:56:27,479
l can understand your agony.

1069
01:56:29,325 --> 01:56:33,819
Every time l come here
and see you in this state...

1070
01:56:35,164 --> 01:56:37,155
l fall in my own esteem.

1071
01:56:40,503 --> 01:56:42,835
Falling in one's own esteem
really hurts.

1072
01:56:48,344 --> 01:56:55,682
l can't ask you to
bear pain for a man...

1073
01:56:55,785 --> 01:56:58,345
who is neither
friend nor relative

1074
01:56:59,856 --> 01:57:03,019
That's for you to decide.

1075
01:57:05,361 --> 01:57:08,353
''lf you can't keep quiet,
then speak out.''

1076
01:57:09,365 --> 01:57:11,356
Do speak out.

1077
01:57:13,703 --> 01:57:16,866
But l'm not throwing
Rajesh out of my house!

1078
01:57:18,708 --> 01:57:21,871
Because Rajesh is my friend.

1079
01:57:23,546 --> 01:57:24,877
A friend.

1080
01:57:28,584 --> 01:57:31,644
Who can appreciate friendship
more than a Pathan?

1081
01:58:10,026 --> 01:58:15,862
''What l want to say is that Sher Khan
might die, if we torture him anymore.''

1082
01:58:16,198 --> 01:58:19,690
''Let him die.
lf he doesn't speak, he must die!''

1083
01:58:21,704 --> 01:58:24,537
''But sir, this is a political issue.''

1084
01:58:25,541 --> 01:58:28,874
His death might cause riots.

1085
01:58:29,378 --> 01:58:31,312
That's all right.

1086
01:58:34,650 --> 01:58:40,816
''But sir, so much of bloodshed
to arrest one revolutionary...?''

1087
01:58:42,658 --> 01:58:45,149
Rajesh is a murderer
not a revolutionary!

1088
01:58:45,261 --> 01:58:47,661
He has killed many British officers!

1089
01:58:47,830 --> 01:58:54,668
The government can take the lives of
400 million lndians for each officer!

1090
01:59:09,185 --> 01:59:11,176
Constable...

1091
01:59:12,021 --> 01:59:15,013
may l have some water?

1092
01:59:15,524 --> 01:59:21,190
Why not? l'll give you
water a hundred times.

1093
01:59:21,530 --> 01:59:24,021
Man gives water even to animals.

1094
01:59:24,533 --> 01:59:29,197
This constable is a bastard.
He's always treating you cruelly.

1095
01:59:41,984 --> 01:59:44,646
Constable!

1096
01:59:48,658 --> 01:59:50,649
Lord Almighty...

1097
01:59:51,494 --> 01:59:54,657
This is no mean death.

1098
01:59:55,665 --> 02:00:01,001
Consider this to be my last prayer.

1099
02:00:06,342 --> 02:00:07,673
Fetch a doctor!

1100
02:00:07,843 --> 02:00:10,676
- Where is Rajesh?
- Go and get a doctor!

1101
02:00:12,348 --> 02:00:14,339
Go on!

1102
02:00:15,017 --> 02:00:17,349
What have you done?

1103
02:00:23,025 --> 02:00:25,016
What else could l do?

1104
02:00:26,862 --> 02:00:30,195
You are a good friend.

1105
02:00:31,467 --> 02:00:35,801
And l gave my life
for your friendship.

1106
02:00:43,379 --> 02:00:46,974
You are holding the Holy Koran!

1107
02:00:47,983 --> 02:00:50,144
A Muslim never lies
on his death bed.

1108
02:01:10,673 --> 02:01:12,664
Rajesh...

1109
02:01:16,345 --> 02:01:19,337
is in my heart.

1110
02:01:26,021 --> 02:01:28,012
ln my heart.

1111
02:01:44,140 --> 02:01:46,131
Hats off to you.

1112
02:01:53,983 --> 02:01:55,974
What are you thinking of?

1113
02:01:58,654 --> 02:02:02,818
l don't want to lie to Dheeraj.

1114
02:02:03,659 --> 02:02:07,993
And l can't speak the truth.
- Friends don't lie.

1115
02:02:08,664 --> 02:02:12,498
''lf you consider him a friend,
tell him the truth.''

1116
02:02:14,336 --> 02:02:16,668
Certain truths can't be spoken.

1117
02:02:17,840 --> 02:02:20,001
He must not find out
about our love.

1118
02:02:21,343 --> 02:02:23,675
You don't understand.
He's a friend!

1119
02:02:23,846 --> 02:02:26,838
''He will give up his life,
but won't stand in my way!''

1120
02:02:28,684 --> 02:02:32,120
Under no circumstances
can l tell him this!

1121
02:02:32,621 --> 02:02:36,614
What if he finds out through
some other means?

1122
02:02:38,460 --> 02:02:40,451
lt will be disastrous!

1123
02:02:46,468 --> 02:02:48,459
This file on Rajesh
has arrived from Jaunpur.

1124
02:02:48,637 --> 02:02:51,970
Everything right from his birth
to date is mentioned in this.

1125
02:03:10,993 --> 02:03:14,656
lt has been found that
the accused Rajesh and ....

1126
02:03:14,763 --> 02:03:19,496
''Judge Shrikant's daughter,
Kamini are deeply in love.''

1127
02:03:22,171 --> 02:03:26,505
Kamini and Rajesh
loved each other...?

1128
02:03:28,177 --> 02:03:31,271
Why did they keep it
hidden from me?

1129
02:03:32,615 --> 02:03:37,780
They kept it from me because
they still love each other...

1130
02:03:39,121 --> 02:03:42,113
which means Rajesh
has deceived me!

1131
02:04:07,650 --> 02:04:08,981
Who is winning?

1132
02:04:09,151 --> 02:04:12,314
''With a partner like mine,
how can l win... ?''

1133
02:04:12,488 --> 02:04:16,652
- But you're a good player.
- What can a player do...

1134
02:04:16,759 --> 02:04:18,750
When the queen deceives him?

1135
02:04:18,994 --> 02:04:21,827
l thought my partner had the queen.

1136
02:04:21,997 --> 02:04:25,160
Kamini and Rajesh in love... ?

1137
02:04:25,668 --> 02:04:27,659
From the beginning...?

1138
02:04:28,337 --> 02:04:31,272
Why did they hide it
from me? Why... ?

1139
02:04:32,608 --> 02:04:37,602
They kept it because
they are still in love.

1140
02:04:41,684 --> 02:04:44,619
This means Rajesh has cheated me!

1141
02:04:46,689 --> 02:04:48,782
l know all about him.

1142
02:04:49,625 --> 02:04:51,286
He has been my neighbor.

1143
02:04:57,733 --> 02:05:01,635
You should have been
honest with the girl.

1144
02:05:02,304 --> 02:05:05,296
lt's possible rather than
live as somebody's wife...

1145
02:05:05,641 --> 02:05:08,804
she'd prefer to be your widow.

1146
02:05:14,650 --> 02:05:16,811
This is the file of Rajesh Narain.

1147
02:05:17,319 --> 02:05:21,653
All that was written in the margin
on your order has been scratched out.

1148
02:05:22,658 --> 02:05:25,821
You can imagine who scratched it.

1149
02:05:30,933 --> 02:05:34,096
Who is it? Who is it?

1150
02:05:38,273 --> 02:05:40,264
''Scared you by knocking, did l?''

1151
02:05:44,113 --> 02:05:47,276
But why do you have to knock?

1152
02:05:50,786 --> 02:05:54,278
One mustn't enter anyone's
bedroom without permission.

1153
02:05:55,290 --> 02:05:57,281
Not even your own?

1154
02:05:57,793 --> 02:06:01,126
Mine...? Oh yes!
This is my bedroom!

1155
02:06:01,630 --> 02:06:03,791
l think l'm high...

1156
02:06:08,303 --> 02:06:11,295
No glass or stone...

1157
02:06:12,307 --> 02:06:16,300
Not a mirror. This is my heart...

1158
02:06:17,312 --> 02:06:20,304
which my friend broke.

1159
02:06:22,651 --> 02:06:28,988
''This friend of mine,
and your neighbor...''

1160
02:06:29,658 --> 02:06:31,819
he's a wonderful poet!

1161
02:06:32,828 --> 02:06:36,320
''Rajesh, you are incomparable!''

1162
02:06:36,999 --> 02:06:39,331
''Nobody comes close, my friend!''

1163
02:06:40,669 --> 02:06:46,835
You are my life. Hear a
poem of yours on my life.

1164
02:06:49,678 --> 02:06:53,170
l address you as
nothing else but my life.

1165
02:06:54,349 --> 02:06:58,012
''Like life, l can't trust you.''

1166
02:07:00,689 --> 02:07:02,680
Can't trust you either.

1167
02:07:07,029 --> 02:07:09,361
l'll get you some tea.

1168
02:07:09,531 --> 02:07:12,864
Forget the tea.

1169
02:07:13,702 --> 02:07:18,366
Today l'll give him some news
that will make him dance with joy!

1170
02:07:20,876 --> 02:07:27,873
The truck driver Sher Khan finally
died at the hands of the police.

1171
02:07:31,653 --> 02:07:36,317
He's dead...? When was he caught?

1172
02:07:40,162 --> 02:07:42,653
l want to know when he was arrested!

1173
02:07:42,998 --> 02:07:44,989
l don't want to recall that day.

1174
02:07:46,668 --> 02:07:49,831
But what a man he was!

1175
02:07:52,341 --> 02:07:54,332
''Before he died, he said...''

1176
02:07:56,345 --> 02:07:58,336
Rajesh lives in my heart.

1177
02:07:59,681 --> 02:08:01,672
ln how many hearts do you live?

1178
02:08:02,351 --> 02:08:08,187
You're in my heart. ln the heart
of the girl you deceived.

1179
02:08:11,026 --> 02:08:13,017
You were firmly planted
in Sher Khan's heart too.

1180
02:08:14,696 --> 02:08:18,359
Make up your mind. ln whose heart
do you really want to live?

1181
02:08:20,869 --> 02:08:25,533
You should not have kept the news
about Sher Khan hidden from me.

1182
02:08:29,044 --> 02:08:33,140
You too have kept things from me.

1183
02:08:34,149 --> 02:08:38,813
And she too has kept things
hidden from me.

1184
02:08:40,489 --> 02:08:46,485
''But my love, we get to know.''

1185
02:08:48,997 --> 02:08:53,991
l look in the depths...

1186
02:08:56,672 --> 02:08:59,835
of my heart

1187
02:09:02,344 --> 02:09:05,177
''Like an arrow,...''

1188
02:09:05,280 --> 02:09:11,685
it pierces my heart

1189
02:09:12,020 --> 02:09:18,516
''There are things that
happen between friends...''

1190
02:09:25,300 --> 02:09:31,296
it turns friends into foes

1191
02:09:31,640 --> 02:09:37,806
''There are things that
happen between friends''

1192
02:10:03,839 --> 02:10:09,835
''To what end will l suppress
the secrets of my heart?''

1193
02:10:16,685 --> 02:10:22,681
''What point anymore
in quenching the fires?''

1194
02:10:26,028 --> 02:10:32,297
''The fires are put out,
razing everything to ashes...''

1195
02:10:38,807 --> 02:10:44,643
turning friends into foes

1196
02:10:44,980 --> 02:10:50,976
''That which happens
between friends...''

1197
02:11:16,578 --> 02:11:22,676
''What's wrong if l give you
an opportunity to complain?''

1198
02:11:29,191 --> 02:11:35,130
You have deceived me too

1199
02:11:38,967 --> 02:11:44,803
Life somehow comes around...

1200
02:11:51,313 --> 02:11:57,309
but friends turn into foes

1201
02:11:57,652 --> 02:12:03,818
''There are things that
happen between friends...''

1202
02:12:12,667 --> 02:12:19,163
Ask him if l have endangered
my life for him or not.

1203
02:12:19,341 --> 02:12:25,177
Ask him if l have ever refused
to give him anything he wanted!

1204
02:12:25,347 --> 02:12:27,679
So why does he hesitate today?

1205
02:12:28,183 --> 02:12:33,120
''My friend, why don't you say
that you love my wife?''

1206
02:12:34,289 --> 02:12:36,280
''You are drunk, Dheeraj!''

1207
02:12:36,458 --> 02:12:43,796
''Yes, and a drunken man
does not lie like his friend!''

1208
02:12:45,967 --> 02:12:48,299
lt's a matter of shame for me...

1209
02:12:49,304 --> 02:12:54,799
...to find out about your
love story from the police files!

1210
02:12:57,813 --> 02:13:01,806
Neither my friend
nor my wife told me!

1211
02:13:04,319 --> 02:13:06,310
This is why l didn't want
to stay here.

1212
02:13:07,656 --> 02:13:11,820
''For this very reason.
l loved Kamini, no doubt.''

1213
02:13:12,661 --> 02:13:15,323
But then she wasn't married to you.

1214
02:13:17,833 --> 02:13:19,824
Not married... ?

1215
02:13:22,504 --> 02:13:30,001
When she'd rather have been
your widow than my wife...

1216
02:13:30,345 --> 02:13:32,609
why did she marry me?

1217
02:13:32,781 --> 02:13:34,772
Why..?

1218
02:13:35,784 --> 02:13:38,116
Today l want to ask both of you...

1219
02:13:38,286 --> 02:13:40,447
what is my fault?

1220
02:13:41,289 --> 02:13:44,622
For what crime am l being punished?

1221
02:13:44,726 --> 02:13:50,460
What have my friend and wife
been doing in my own house?

1222
02:13:52,634 --> 02:13:54,795
That's enough!
You're talking nonsense!

1223
02:14:04,312 --> 02:14:06,303
lnsolent man...

1224
02:14:09,317 --> 02:14:12,809
shameless creature...

1225
02:14:24,332 --> 02:14:27,165
''Who is it?
- The police are here, sir.''

1226
02:14:32,774 --> 02:14:34,765
''Don't you worry, my friend.''

1227
02:14:37,279 --> 02:14:40,271
Nobody can arrest my friend as yet.

1228
02:14:41,449 --> 02:14:43,781
l still have to prove my friendship.

1229
02:14:55,463 --> 02:14:58,796
l have orders to search your house.

1230
02:15:06,308 --> 02:15:10,802
First tell the lG to fire me!

1231
02:15:10,979 --> 02:15:14,471
l have a search warrant.

1232
02:15:15,317 --> 02:15:19,310
You're making a big mistake.

1233
02:15:21,489 --> 02:15:23,480
''The fact is, you made a mistake..''

1234
02:15:23,592 --> 02:15:29,155
...by erasing the line about
your wife in Rajesh's file.

1235
02:15:29,664 --> 02:15:32,258
That noting was made by me.

1236
02:15:32,434 --> 02:15:34,595
Under orders from the Collector.

1237
02:15:35,604 --> 02:15:39,438
lt would be best if you
hand Rajesh over to us.

1238
02:15:39,608 --> 02:15:42,771
You seem to have forgotten
that l am still the SP!

1239
02:15:43,278 --> 02:15:47,942
lf each one of you doesn't
get out in 2 minutes...

1240
02:15:48,049 --> 02:15:49,778
l will open fire!

1241
02:15:49,884 --> 02:15:52,444
What's the matter?
What is going on here?

1242
02:15:53,622 --> 02:15:56,284
They think we've hidden Rajesh.

1243
02:15:56,625 --> 02:16:01,961
- Who... ?
- Your neighbor in Jaunpur.

1244
02:16:02,297 --> 02:16:06,131
''You mean, your constable
will search your own house?''

1245
02:16:06,635 --> 02:16:10,969
Yes. My constable is a loyal man.

1246
02:16:11,306 --> 02:16:13,297
He's even brought a search warrant!

1247
02:16:13,475 --> 02:16:16,638
So let them in.
How does it matter?

1248
02:17:34,656 --> 02:17:36,647
Constable!

1249
02:17:39,494 --> 02:17:41,325
- Have you completed the search?
- Yes.

1250
02:17:41,429 --> 02:17:46,662
You've been quite impertinent!
Get out!

1251
02:18:00,348 --> 02:18:03,511
So you somehow managed
to throw Rajesh out.

1252
02:18:06,187 --> 02:18:09,520
l'm glad. The poor guy's
life got spared.

1253
02:18:09,858 --> 02:18:14,693
You said nobody could arrest
your friend in your house.

1254
02:18:17,365 --> 02:18:20,198
You do know how to take
advantage of my words.

1255
02:18:20,869 --> 02:18:23,201
You haven't saved my Rajesh.

1256
02:18:23,538 --> 02:18:25,529
You've saved your Rajesh!

1257
02:18:28,877 --> 02:18:33,314
Then why didn't you
get my Rajesh arrested?

1258
02:18:35,150 --> 02:18:39,314
This is a way of being a friend...
And you won't understand it.

1259
02:18:47,162 --> 02:18:49,824
The lG is coming for the celebration.
l've explained the plan to you.

1260
02:18:49,931 --> 02:18:54,334
So what are you thinking?
- Your plan is 100%%% right.

1261
02:18:54,836 --> 02:18:59,671
''But seeing the police arrangements,
we wonder how you will return.''

1262
02:19:00,341 --> 02:19:03,674
This job is like committing suicide.

1263
02:19:04,179 --> 02:19:07,512
l know it. l really do.

1264
02:19:08,349 --> 02:19:14,345
But the joy you get by dying can't
be had by living for a 1000 years!

1265
02:19:20,028 --> 02:19:24,863
l give you trouble to
come here today...

1266
02:19:25,366 --> 02:19:28,529
because a very reliable source
has informed us that...

1267
02:19:28,870 --> 02:19:35,969
Terrorists are going to create
problems in the celebrations tonight.

1268
02:19:37,145 --> 02:19:42,640
Rest assured sir.
There will be no problem.

1269
02:19:47,322 --> 02:19:49,313
Am l hearing this from you?

1270
02:19:50,658 --> 02:19:53,149
''You just heard that, sir.''

1271
02:19:54,829 --> 02:19:58,162
Tomorrow you'll see Rajesh hang!

1272
02:20:05,340 --> 02:20:07,331
- Take a seat.
- Thank you.

1273
02:20:07,442 --> 02:20:08,670
Rajesh will surely be caught now.

1274
02:20:08,776 --> 02:20:13,338
This is the wonder of the
note written on Rajesh's file.

1275
02:20:16,517 --> 02:20:22,854
A heart set aflame by a jealousy
can only be extinguished by blood.

1276
02:20:24,859 --> 02:20:27,692
Whom are you planning to kill?

1277
02:20:28,363 --> 02:20:30,957
Can't cops think of
anything but murder?

1278
02:20:32,634 --> 02:20:35,967
Of course. They do.

1279
02:20:37,639 --> 02:20:40,972
They also think of
what friendship means.

1280
02:20:42,310 --> 02:20:46,303
They also think of the duty
of a husband and a wife.

1281
02:20:47,315 --> 02:20:51,149
They think of the love that
still exists for a friend.

1282
02:20:52,654 --> 02:20:55,987
They also think of the
trust they had in their wives!

1283
02:20:57,825 --> 02:21:00,487
- Had... ?
- Yes.

1284
02:21:01,829 --> 02:21:03,820
You probably think about it too.

1285
02:21:04,065 --> 02:21:05,657
Sure.

1286
02:21:07,001 --> 02:21:10,994
This is a man's world.
Man makes all the rules!

1287
02:21:13,508 --> 02:21:18,343
''Had women made the rules,
how would you punish yourself?''

1288
02:21:18,680 --> 02:21:23,014
l'll answer this question on
returning from the celebrations.

1289
02:21:24,185 --> 02:21:26,176
You are not going there.

1290
02:21:27,355 --> 02:21:29,346
We fear there might be
bloodshed there.

1291
02:21:30,024 --> 02:21:35,621
We've heard a revolutionary named
Rajesh is going to attack the lG.

1292
02:21:36,297 --> 02:21:41,792
He will try to kill him
but l won't let him!

1293
02:24:46,787 --> 02:24:48,778
Ladies and gentlemen...

1294
02:24:48,956 --> 02:24:53,620
''the trick that l'll now demonstrate,
will stun the entire nation.''

1295
02:24:55,963 --> 02:24:57,624
Stop there!

1296
02:25:37,772 --> 02:25:42,106
''lf Rajesh escapes, l'll strip you
of your skin and rank!''

1297
02:25:46,948 --> 02:25:48,939
- Anybody on the roof?
- No.

1298
02:25:49,116 --> 02:25:51,107
Then go where Rajesh is!

1299
02:26:03,631 --> 02:26:06,623
This could only have
been done by Rajesh.

1300
02:26:08,302 --> 02:26:13,467
Where the hell were you
when Rajesh tied the real joker?

1301
02:26:18,479 --> 02:26:21,642
Here is your lover!
And here is my bed!

1302
02:26:24,151 --> 02:26:25,982
Why do you feel shy before me?

1303
02:26:26,153 --> 02:26:28,314
l am family.
Enjoy yourself in my presence!

1304
02:26:31,826 --> 02:26:33,316
''The truth is bitter, isn't it?''

1305
02:26:33,494 --> 02:26:35,826
''When it's not the truth,
how can it be bitter?''

1306
02:26:36,497 --> 02:26:39,489
Don't tell lies!

1307
02:26:42,003 --> 02:26:43,994
You are not in your senses.

1308
02:26:44,505 --> 02:26:48,339
''When you come to your senses,
you will regret this.''

1309
02:26:48,843 --> 02:26:52,506
''You'll search for me to apologize,
but you won't ever find me!''

1310
02:26:52,847 --> 02:26:57,181
Why won't l find you?
Where can you go away?

1311
02:26:57,685 --> 02:27:02,349
You have the friend's house.
And his wife.

1312
02:27:02,690 --> 02:27:05,853
You needn't fear the police.
They won't come here again.

1313
02:27:06,360 --> 02:27:09,693
l didn't risk my life
to get you here.

1314
02:27:09,797 --> 02:27:13,198
To break your lover's heart
and leave!

1315
02:27:24,879 --> 02:27:28,872
Sorry for what? For slapping me?

1316
02:27:29,383 --> 02:27:33,319
''Or for romancing with my wife?
- lf you want an answer, hear this!''

1317
02:27:35,656 --> 02:27:39,319
l sure did love Kamini. l still
love her and will always do!

1318
02:27:47,335 --> 02:27:50,168
The heart doesn't work
on electrical wires.

1319
02:27:50,671 --> 02:27:53,504
You can't switch it off
to stop the flow of love.

1320
02:27:54,742 --> 02:27:57,006
Let my friend speak.

1321
02:27:57,678 --> 02:28:03,344
Let me hear what my wife's
lover wants to tell me.

1322
02:28:06,354 --> 02:28:09,346
Your wife's lover wants to tell you...

1323
02:28:09,457 --> 02:28:11,516
''you are an obstacle, not a friend.''

1324
02:28:12,526 --> 02:28:16,189
Right on.
Smart right from your birth!

1325
02:28:16,697 --> 02:28:19,359
''lf l am an obstacle,
do away with me.''

1326
02:28:20,034 --> 02:28:24,368
The nuptial night that remained
incomplete by your arrival...

1327
02:28:24,472 --> 02:28:26,531
will be fulfilled tonight.

1328
02:28:26,774 --> 02:28:29,709
Tonight will be your last night...

1329
02:28:29,810 --> 02:28:32,643
''Because l'll fill Kamini's hair
with your blood, not vermilion!''

1330
02:28:32,813 --> 02:28:35,475
''- Are you mad?
- Yes, l'm mad!''

1331
02:28:35,816 --> 02:28:38,478
''l am mad! Stark, raving mad!''

1332
02:28:38,652 --> 02:28:41,644
l'm going mad seeing my
lover on my friend's bed!

1333
02:28:42,323 --> 02:28:45,486
''You belong to me, Kamini!
Even after becoming his wife!''

1334
02:28:46,660 --> 02:28:52,997
Tell him what happens in the privacy
of this room when he goes to work!

1335
02:28:53,834 --> 02:28:58,669
Right here... your tresses
complained to my shoulder...

1336
02:29:00,674 --> 02:29:03,165
how your lips quenched
the thirst of my lips!

1337
02:29:09,517 --> 02:29:11,508
Get up!

1338
02:29:17,691 --> 02:29:21,183
l'm in no mood to die now.

1339
02:29:22,530 --> 02:29:24,691
You married my beloved.

1340
02:29:25,533 --> 02:29:29,526
Now l'll marry your widow
and level the scores.

1341
02:29:33,808 --> 02:29:39,144
l don't want to live after the
betrayal of my friend and wife.

1342
02:29:39,380 --> 02:29:42,645
''Hear that, Kamini?
He's giving us a speech.''

1343
02:29:42,817 --> 02:29:47,311
''So die then. lf you can't,
l'll shoot you.''

1344
02:29:48,823 --> 02:29:54,819
What's the point in proving
your loyalty to this man?

1345
02:29:55,663 --> 02:29:59,827
The days of pretending are gone.
Now he is going to die.

1346
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:02,992
What can l expect from a friend?

1347
02:30:04,338 --> 02:30:06,829
The heart is not fully broken yet.

1348
02:30:07,675 --> 02:30:11,338
l want a friend's mercy.
- Don't call me a friend!

1349
02:30:14,348 --> 02:30:16,509
''Yesterday, we were friends.''

1350
02:30:16,851 --> 02:30:18,842
''Today, we are foes.''

1351
02:30:19,186 --> 02:30:21,848
And there's just one cure for them.

1352
02:30:23,357 --> 02:30:26,520
l'll miss you after you're dead.

1353
02:30:26,694 --> 02:30:30,790
Throw away the revolver!
Or l'll shoot!

1354
02:30:33,300 --> 02:30:35,791
Just listen to this girl.

1355
02:30:36,470 --> 02:30:38,631
''She'll shoot me, she says!''

1356
02:30:39,640 --> 02:30:46,307
''Remember you said when an lndian
girl falls in love, it's forever.''

1357
02:30:46,647 --> 02:30:48,638
''He said that, not me.''

1358
02:30:48,983 --> 02:30:55,650
''l had said when an lndian girl
gets married, it's for keeps!''

1359
02:31:00,661 --> 02:31:02,822
That's what you should say
in front of the husband.

1360
02:31:03,330 --> 02:31:05,491
But what's the point in lying now?

1361
02:31:05,833 --> 02:31:07,824
He's going to die.

1362
02:31:08,869 --> 02:31:13,329
l know you are dying
to end Dheeraj's story...

1363
02:31:13,440 --> 02:31:16,000
and we can begin anew!
- l will shoot you!

1364
02:31:16,176 --> 02:31:20,340
You can't shoot your lover
to save your husband!

1365
02:31:42,469 --> 02:31:47,304
Your wife has really
shot your friend.

1366
02:32:06,660 --> 02:32:08,992
''At least now, embrace me... my friend.''

1367
02:32:18,672 --> 02:32:21,334
lt's my good fortune...

1368
02:32:22,009 --> 02:32:24,170
...that Kamini shot me.

1369
02:32:24,678 --> 02:32:28,170
This was the only way
to remove your doubt.

1370
02:32:29,850 --> 02:32:36,449
Do you still doubt my friendship
and Kamini's loyalty?

1371
02:32:39,627 --> 02:32:44,291
''You fool, if you can risk
your life to clear my doubts...''

1372
02:32:44,398 --> 02:32:46,457
how can l have any doubts?

1373
02:32:46,800 --> 02:32:49,792
l am sorry that l lost.

1374
02:32:59,480 --> 02:33:05,817
Your husband is a very stupid man.

1375
02:33:11,158 --> 02:33:15,492
This love story could've had
no end other than with my death.

1376
02:33:21,835 --> 02:33:24,167
My death won't change anything.

1377
02:33:24,271 --> 02:33:27,672
But your death would
have made Kamini a widow.

1378
02:33:32,279 --> 02:33:35,612
l can't see anything!

1379
02:33:38,619 --> 02:33:40,610
Where's your hand?

1380
02:33:47,294 --> 02:33:49,626
Kamini loves to laugh.

1381
02:33:51,632 --> 02:33:53,793
Keep her happy.

1382
02:33:57,638 --> 02:34:00,971
Silly girl. Why are you crying?

1383
02:34:03,143 --> 02:34:05,134
You didn't kill me.

1384
02:34:06,647 --> 02:34:10,640
l first died with my brother.

1385
02:34:10,751 --> 02:34:16,155
Then with Munni. Finally l
died completely with Sher Khan.

1386
02:34:17,658 --> 02:34:20,650
l...l...

1387
02:34:23,330 --> 02:34:25,662
l've enough practice of dying.

1388
02:34:31,438 --> 02:34:35,272
l feel... l wish...

1389
02:34:36,276 --> 02:34:39,939
l want to always see both of you.

1390
02:34:41,615 --> 02:34:45,278
But my eyes can't remain open.

1391
02:34:47,621 --> 02:34:53,287
He'll listen to you.
Tell him to stay alive!

1392
02:34:53,794 --> 02:34:58,629
Open your eyes!

1393
02:35:00,300 --> 02:35:03,792
The friend asks me to open my eyes.

1394
02:35:07,141 --> 02:35:10,633
And death asks me to go to sleep.
