1
00:00:29,157 --> 00:00:32,422
What is going on in this land
of river Ganga nowadays?

2
00:00:33,161 --> 00:00:34,594
Every one knows that.

3
00:00:35,163 --> 00:00:38,394
What should happen? Every
one knows that, too.

4
00:00:39,501 --> 00:00:44,234
But no one knows how and in
what way it should happen.

5
00:00:44,339 --> 00:00:46,398
Yes, no one knows that.

6
00:01:09,531 --> 00:01:12,591
''Look, my heart is crying.''

7
00:01:13,201 --> 00:01:16,261
''What never happens
has happened now.''

8
00:01:16,371 --> 00:01:19,465
''Look, my heart is crying.''

9
00:01:20,575 --> 00:01:23,271
''What never happens
has happened now.''

10
00:01:23,378 --> 00:01:25,471
''There's corruption all around.''

11
00:01:27,582 --> 00:01:29,277
''There's bullying all around.''

12
00:01:30,385 --> 00:01:32,114
''There's corruption all around.''

13
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,619
''There's bullying all around.''

14
00:01:34,322 --> 00:01:37,291
''We wish there was a brave man
who'd be good at heart.''

15
00:01:37,392 --> 00:01:40,293
''He'd stake his life, and would
give his life for honor.''

16
00:01:40,395 --> 00:01:43,125
''This bloodshed, corruption,
rapes, harassment..''

17
00:01:43,231 --> 00:01:48,294
''..he'd vanquish it all.''

18
00:01:49,237 --> 00:01:52,297
''Who'd sacrifice for all that?''

19
00:01:52,407 --> 00:01:55,865
''One whose tales would
be written in history.''

20
00:01:56,544 --> 00:02:02,540
''Who'd sacrifice? Who'd sacrifice?''

21
00:02:24,672 --> 00:02:27,163
''lf the poor ones don't
get justice..''

22
00:02:27,275 --> 00:02:30,540
''..what use is such
government and law?''

23
00:02:33,581 --> 00:02:39,542
''Why do we need such leaders
who can't provide us jobs?''

24
00:02:41,656 --> 00:02:47,925
''A leader should be bold enough
to change the blind law.''

25
00:02:48,596 --> 00:02:51,565
''He'd end harassment in
this selfish society.''

26
00:02:52,667 --> 00:02:55,363
''He'd end harassment.''

27
00:03:00,475 --> 00:03:07,711
''We wish there was a brave man
who'd be good at heart.''

28
00:03:08,616 --> 00:03:11,380
''He'd stake his life, and would
give his life for honor.''

29
00:03:11,486 --> 00:03:16,219
''This bloodshed, corruption,
rapes, harassment..''

30
00:03:16,324 --> 00:03:19,384
''..he'd vanquish it all.''

31
00:03:19,494 --> 00:03:22,395
''Who'd sacrifice for all that?''

32
00:03:23,498 --> 00:03:26,592
''One whose tales would
be written in history.''

33
00:03:26,701 --> 00:03:33,402
''Who'd sacrifice? Who'd sacrifice?''

34
00:03:54,896 --> 00:04:01,426
''A wife is raped before
the eyes of her husband.''

35
00:04:03,538 --> 00:04:10,000
''The guardians keep watching
while their fate is robbed.''

36
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:18,641
''No one is safe here; the
fire of hatred is burning.''

37
00:04:19,687 --> 00:04:24,283
''A girl is afraid to even
go to the police station..''

38
00:04:24,392 --> 00:04:25,791
''..to register a complaint.''

39
00:04:25,894 --> 00:04:29,022
''A girl is afraid to even go.''

40
00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:38,036
''We wish there was a brave man
who'd be good at heart.''

41
00:04:38,706 --> 00:04:41,675

''One whose tales would
be written in history.''

46
00:04:57,592 --> 00:05:03,690
''Who'd sacrifice? Who'd sacrifice?''

47
00:05:04,799 --> 00:05:10,704
''Who'd sacrifice? Who'd sacrifice?''

48
00:05:43,838 --> 00:05:45,703
Sir, why are you snapping
your fingers?

49
00:05:46,808 --> 00:05:53,111
l find my girl even more
beautiful in my dreams.

50
00:05:58,486 --> 00:06:01,546
The fish will be hooked.

51
00:06:09,664 --> 00:06:10,790
Alright, sir.

52
00:06:41,529 --> 00:06:43,588
Where are you taking her?
- Let go of me!

53
00:06:50,705 --> 00:06:51,831
Come in.

54
00:06:56,944 --> 00:06:58,605
Who are you? Let go of me!

55
00:06:59,714 --> 00:07:00,806
Let go!

56
00:07:14,562 --> 00:07:17,622
Don't you dare touch me! Let me go!

57
00:07:17,732 --> 00:07:19,825
Listen, darling. Don't scream.

58
00:07:20,568 --> 00:07:24,834
When someone screams,
it hurts my heart.

59
00:07:26,941 --> 00:07:30,843
And when my heart is hurt,
l feel very angry.

60
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,840
And when l get angry, l cruelly..
you know what?

61
00:07:38,953 --> 00:07:42,855
l love with much cruelty. Just
as l will love you now.

62
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:45,220
No!
- Yes.

63
00:07:45,593 --> 00:07:47,220
No!
- Yes.

64
00:07:47,595 --> 00:07:49,222
No!
- Yes.

65
00:07:49,597 --> 00:07:51,861
No! No!

66
00:08:26,801 --> 00:08:30,897
Go; now it's your turn.

67
00:09:09,043 --> 00:09:10,101
Oh damn it! Damn it!

68
00:09:20,221 --> 00:09:22,314
What the hell are you doing?
What are you all doing?

69
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:24,749
What a wicked man he is!

70
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,590
A woman is satisfying the
hunger of her child..

71
00:09:28,696 --> 00:09:30,960
..while this man thinks
only of his hunger.

72
00:09:31,699 --> 00:09:33,326
Bloody bastard!

73
00:09:33,701 --> 00:09:36,329
What did you say? Said
that in English, eh?

74
00:09:37,705 --> 00:09:38,933
The child is really lovely.

75
00:09:41,709 --> 00:09:42,937
No!

76
00:09:44,045 --> 00:09:45,342
l want him dead or alive.

77
00:09:51,018 --> 00:09:53,350
This is really embarrassing
for the police department.

78
00:09:53,721 --> 00:09:55,621
A small gang kidnaps women..

79
00:09:55,723 --> 00:10:00,660
..any time from anywhere it wishes.

80
00:10:01,762 --> 00:10:04,629
They rape them ruthlessly..

81
00:10:04,732 --> 00:10:06,791
..and then throw the dead bodies
on the road, so that..

82
00:10:06,901 --> 00:10:09,369
..we'd have to fulfill the duty
of taking it to their parents.

83
00:10:10,037 --> 00:10:14,997
ls that what we are here for?
- We are helpless, sir.

84
00:10:15,743 --> 00:10:18,803
No one in the city is ready to give
any statement against this gang.

85
00:10:18,913 --> 00:10:21,643
The common man can be helpless..

86
00:10:21,749 --> 00:10:24,809
..he doesn't have the strength
to fight criminals.

87
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,823
But we haven't moved beyond defeat
despite having the power.

88
00:10:30,925 --> 00:10:33,655
Sir! - Yes? - When we
tried to move ahead..

89
00:10:33,761 --> 00:10:37,026
..they shot 4 of our brave officers.

90
00:10:40,067 --> 00:10:41,659
l am proud of those officers..

91
00:10:41,769 --> 00:10:45,034
..who gave away their
lives for their duties.

92
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:50,042
But what have you done to
fulfill your duty? Nothing.

93
00:10:51,078 --> 00:10:53,410
There's uproar in
the entire country.

94
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:59,052
l've heard that a special officer
is arriving here from Delhi.

95
00:10:59,153 --> 00:11:01,849
l was sure you'd act stubborn.

96
00:11:01,956 --> 00:11:03,685
You got the order for
moving to Mumbai..

97
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:06,021
..even when l refused, right?

98
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:10,859
How can you be scared despite
being a policeman's wife?

99
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,064
Every moment of my life is a test.

100
00:11:16,804 --> 00:11:19,864
Throw out this thing called
fear from your life.

101
00:11:19,974 --> 00:11:24,434
l am not scared for you or me. l
am scared for our little child.

102
00:11:25,112 --> 00:11:26,704
l've heard that that
goon kills anyone..

103
00:11:26,814 --> 00:11:29,078
..who even speaks against him,
let alone facing him.

104
00:11:35,189 --> 00:11:37,885
Have you forgotten what
happened to my sister?

105
00:11:37,992 --> 00:11:40,085
What happened to her?

106
00:11:41,195 --> 00:11:42,890
What? They kidnapped Bindu?

107
00:11:43,831 --> 00:11:46,459
Where? l'll reach there.

108
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:04,112
Bindu!

109
00:12:05,219 --> 00:12:06,914
Mind you! Don't come closer!
- Bindu!

110
00:12:08,022 --> 00:12:12,482
No! Don't come closer! Don't move.

111
00:12:15,863 --> 00:12:17,490
l am inspector Arjun Singh's sister.

112
00:12:18,866 --> 00:12:22,131
Bindu, l am your brother.. Arjun.
- No.

113
00:12:24,238 --> 00:12:26,103
Don't you recognize me,
dear? lt's me, dear.

114
00:12:28,209 --> 00:12:29,506
Bindu! Bindu!

115
00:12:30,878 --> 00:12:32,505
Bindu! Bindu!

116
00:12:35,883 --> 00:12:37,111
Brother!

117
00:12:38,219 --> 00:12:41,154
What happened? Tell
me what happened.

118
00:12:45,259 --> 00:12:46,920
Brother.. that scoundrel..

119
00:12:48,029 --> 00:12:55,162
Revenge on him for me.
- Bindu!

120
00:12:57,271 --> 00:12:59,171
Bindu! My sister!

121
00:13:01,275 --> 00:13:02,333
Bindu! Have you left me?

122
00:13:05,446 --> 00:13:09,815
l couldn't maintain the honor
of this Rakhi (sacred thread)..

123
00:13:09,917 --> 00:13:15,981
..but l swear on you today
that l won't let him live.

124
00:13:17,925 --> 00:13:19,984
lf you remain alive that is.

125
00:13:23,931 --> 00:13:26,195
Bastard! Scoundrel!

126
00:13:37,311 --> 00:13:39,836
Now the aim of my life is
to revenge on that demon..

127
00:13:39,947 --> 00:13:45,214
..to kill that bastard.

128
00:13:47,321 --> 00:13:49,016
Don't get me wrong, dear.

129
00:13:50,124 --> 00:13:53,218
lf you're going to jump into fire,
consider me with you.

130
00:13:54,328 --> 00:13:58,594
l only pray to God to protect you.

131
00:13:59,967 --> 00:14:04,028
That my husband would
always be safe.

132
00:14:05,406 --> 00:14:07,237
That all troubles coming your
way would come to me.

133
00:14:08,275 --> 00:14:13,235
Anita! You are my strength.

134
00:14:14,348 --> 00:14:17,249
l will win this battle with
the support of this strength.

135
00:14:18,352 --> 00:14:20,047
l will win, Anita.
- Arjun!

136
00:14:21,155 --> 00:14:22,884
Here. - Have you informed
your brother-in-law..

137
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:27,256
..at Bombay that we are coming?
- l've telegrammed him.

138
00:14:29,296 --> 00:14:33,062
Does he really study or does
he keep fooling around?

139
00:14:34,168 --> 00:14:35,260
He is your brother after all.

140
00:14:35,369 --> 00:14:40,068
And these are his days to enjoy.
- That's right.

141
00:14:42,443 --> 00:14:46,072
''l saw Rakhee, l saw Rekha,

142
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:49,638

'' But your style has
stolen my heart.''

144
00:14:53,187 --> 00:14:57,248
''My heart has vowed not
to live without you.''

145
00:14:57,358 --> 00:14:59,292
''That's why l say..

146
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:07,091
''You are my Laila.

''Why would l be scared

''Why wouldn't l love you

''Why wouldn't l love you without
hesitation, darling?''

176
00:17:51,498 --> 00:17:53,466
''Why would l be scared
of the public?''

177
00:17:55,502 --> 00:17:57,493
''Why would l be scared
of the public?''

178
00:18:14,621 --> 00:18:17,283
''For roaming out..
- What?''

179
00:18:17,391 --> 00:18:21,293
''For enjoying ourselves.

180
00:18:21,395 --> 00:18:28,858
''Where will you take me for
roaming and enjoying?''

181
00:18:29,236 --> 00:18:32,296
''Tell me, where will you take me?''

182
00:18:33,407 --> 00:18:36,308
Bori Bunder. Porbander.

183
00:18:37,411 --> 00:18:40,869
'' Bori Bunder. Porbander.
Ajanta and the 7 seas.''

184
00:18:41,548 --> 00:18:44,517
''Your overjoyed lover will show

185
00:18:44,618 --> 00:18:47,519
''l will show you everything.''

186
00:18:52,626 --> 00:19:02,524
''Your crazy lover.. your crazy
lover can't live alone without you.''

187
00:19:15,649 --> 00:19:18,914
''You are my Laila.
- Me? - Yes.''

188
00:19:19,586 --> 00:19:22,555
''You are my Laila. l

189
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:30,560
''Love me without hesitation.
Love me without hesitation.''

190
00:19:31,665 --> 00:19:37,570

''Why wouldn't l love you

195
00:19:53,487 --> 00:19:58,390
''Why wouldn't l love you without
hesitation, darling?''

196
00:19:58,492 --> 00:20:00,722
''Why would l be scared
of the public?''

197
00:20:02,329 --> 00:20:04,593
''Why would l be scared
of the public?''

198
00:20:23,717 --> 00:20:24,775
He ran away!

199
00:20:27,354 --> 00:20:29,413
The rascal is a big flirt!

200
00:20:32,526 --> 00:20:34,255
lf life is saved, one
can earn million bucks.

201
00:20:34,361 --> 00:20:35,623
One should return home..

202
00:20:35,729 --> 00:20:39,631
So, Majnu's successor!
l will slap you.

203
00:20:40,367 --> 00:20:41,629
Aren't you ashamed?
- l am.

204
00:20:41,735 --> 00:20:43,635
That's why l was hiding behind
the bushes. - Liar!

205
00:20:43,737 --> 00:20:44,761
l am saying the truth.

206
00:20:44,872 --> 00:20:47,636
l swear on your eyes,
your cheeks, your hair.

207
00:20:49,743 --> 00:20:51,768
My intentions are virtuous
and holy. l am innocent.

208
00:20:52,379 --> 00:20:54,438
So, shall we go? Girls
are waiting.. - No!

209
00:20:54,548 --> 00:20:55,606
You see, my brother
and sister-in-law..

210
00:20:55,716 --> 00:20:56,774
..are coming from Delhi today.

211
00:20:56,884 --> 00:20:58,442
l must go to receive them.

212
00:20:58,552 --> 00:21:00,645
Let me go. Let me go. Let me go.

213
00:21:01,755 --> 00:21:05,657
Alright, go!
- Thanks a lot.

214
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:10,662
Any day you say, my sweetie pie.

215
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:29,476
The fish will get
trapped in the net.

216
00:21:30,584 --> 00:21:35,487
Boss, it will be good if you leave
this fish for Ranga to trap.

217
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:39,684
Why?
- Because he's taken too much drugs.

218
00:21:40,794 --> 00:21:44,696
lf the police..
- Alright. Alright.

219
00:21:50,804 --> 00:21:51,862
Ok.

220
00:21:56,443 --> 00:21:57,705
Run! Run more!

221
00:21:59,813 --> 00:22:03,510
No one has escaped Ranga's
hands, and no one can.

222
00:22:03,617 --> 00:22:04,845
Run!

223
00:22:09,957 --> 00:22:12,721
O people! Please, save my daughter.

224
00:22:13,827 --> 00:22:18,526
Please, listen to a mother's
plea. Save my daughter.

225
00:22:19,633 --> 00:22:22,534
No one can save your daughter today.

226
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:24,698
No!

227
00:22:25,472 --> 00:22:27,531
Let go of me! Let go!

228
00:22:30,644 --> 00:22:34,546
No! Let go of me!
- l said let go of her!

229
00:22:43,657 --> 00:22:45,557
Brother, please save
me from these men.

230
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,389
lf Ranga unclothes someone..

231
00:22:48,495 --> 00:22:53,558
..there no one who can cover him.

232
00:22:53,667 --> 00:22:56,568
Bring her to me.
- Wait!

233
00:22:57,671 --> 00:22:59,536
Didn't you hear what she called me?

234
00:23:00,641 --> 00:23:01,733
She called me brother.

235
00:23:02,843 --> 00:23:04,777
And a brother's duty is
to save his sister.

236
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:14,578
Go home, sister.

237
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:18,658
Mother! Mother!

238
00:23:26,767 --> 00:23:32,603
l've got to face a brave man
today after a long time.

239
00:23:32,706 --> 00:23:35,800
And l've got to face a
pig after a long time.

240
00:23:56,563 --> 00:23:59,191
My three teeth!

241
00:24:10,877 --> 00:24:12,640
Faster!
- l am tired! - Faster!

242
00:24:14,748 --> 00:24:16,841
You've grown up, but you still
make me play a horse.

243
00:24:17,584 --> 00:24:19,643
Munna! Ajit! The meal is ready.

244
00:24:19,753 --> 00:24:21,846
Coming, Bhabhi. Come.
- Come.

245
00:24:24,958 --> 00:24:28,655
Welcome, bro.
- Wow! Wow, Bhabhi! This is good.

246
00:24:29,763 --> 00:24:31,492
Parathas, Sabzi, pickles, Rabdi..

247
00:24:31,598 --> 00:24:33,657
..everything is of my choice.

248
00:24:33,767 --> 00:24:36,668
And she's cooked this banana, too.
- Don't joke, brother.

249
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:38,499
You are liking it..

250
00:24:38,605 --> 00:24:40,869
..as you're eating food cooked
by her after a long time.

251
00:24:40,974 --> 00:24:43,499
After a few days you'll tell me..

252
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:47,671
..brother, l am tired of this
food; take me to a restaurant.

253
00:24:49,783 --> 00:24:53,879
No, bro. Can l ever
say that, Bhabhi?

254
00:24:54,988 --> 00:24:58,253
My Ajit is not so bad.
- Yes, it's me who is bad.

255
00:24:58,625 --> 00:25:01,890
l keep eating half cooked
food day after day.

256
00:25:03,997 --> 00:25:08,900
lf he likes this food so much, then
find a similar wife for him.

257
00:25:09,636 --> 00:25:11,900
So that he gets used to
such half cooked food.

258
00:25:12,005 --> 00:25:14,906
So? Do you want such a wife?

259
00:25:16,009 --> 00:25:17,533
Listen; there's a
dance competition..

260
00:25:17,644 --> 00:25:18,872
..at Ajit's college tomorrow.

261
00:25:18,979 --> 00:25:21,277
Please, come with
us; it will be fun.

262
00:25:21,648 --> 00:25:25,277
What? Dance competition?

263
00:25:26,653 --> 00:25:30,714
So my brother will dance
at the college? Shucks!

264
00:25:30,824 --> 00:25:31,882
Why shucks, papa?

265
00:25:31,992 --> 00:25:35,928
Amitabh Bachchan dances, too.
So does Vinod Khanna.

266
00:25:36,029 --> 00:25:38,930
You keep quiet! You have
also sided with him.

267
00:25:42,035 --> 00:25:46,938
Look, Ajit, l don't want you to
be a dancer, but a policeman.

268
00:25:48,041 --> 00:25:53,308
Such a strong officer who'd scare
all criminals wherever he goes.

269
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,942
Got it?

270
00:26:03,056 --> 00:26:06,321
Don't worry, Ajit. l know
your brother well.

271
00:26:06,993 --> 00:26:08,585
The day you'll win the
dance competition..

272
00:26:08,695 --> 00:26:10,959
..he will be the first
one to hug you.

273
00:26:12,065 --> 00:26:13,965
Because he likes only
success in life.

274
00:26:18,071 --> 00:26:21,768
What did you say? Ranga came
back defeated? - Yes, sir.

275
00:26:22,709 --> 00:26:23,971
This is surprising.

276
00:26:25,078 --> 00:26:27,603
Arjun, l am much happier
for your success..

277
00:26:27,714 --> 00:26:31,980
..than l was sad for the
defeat of my department.

278
00:26:32,719 --> 00:26:35,347
l congratulate you. - Thank you.
Thank you very much, sir.

279
00:26:36,022 --> 00:26:38,786
l am going abroad for 15 days.

280
00:26:39,893 --> 00:26:43,795
Find out that man who took away
my bite in the meantime.

281
00:26:44,898 --> 00:26:45,956
Yes, sir.

282
00:28:56,196 --> 00:28:58,756
The prize for the
dance competition..

283
00:28:58,865 --> 00:29:00,924
..arranged by Marlex Pressur
Cooker will be conferred..

284
00:29:01,034 --> 00:29:02,092
..by its owner, Mr. Laxmichand.

285
00:29:02,202 --> 00:29:06,935
The winner amongst the boys is..
- O God! O my God!

286
00:29:08,041 --> 00:29:09,133
Ajit!

287
00:29:10,243 --> 00:29:11,301
Mummy, uncle won!

288
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:26,151
Hey! What are you doing?
What have you done?

289
00:29:26,259 --> 00:29:28,159
What mischief you keep playing!

290
00:29:31,898 --> 00:29:33,126
Sir! Thank you.

291
00:29:37,237 --> 00:29:39,171
The winner amongst
the girls is Sonia!

292
00:29:46,279 --> 00:29:47,303
Here.
- Thank you.

293
00:29:47,414 --> 00:29:48,813
There's a saying in
English which goes..

294
00:29:48,915 --> 00:29:52,180
..the way to a man's heart
is through his stomach.

295
00:29:53,286 --> 00:29:54,810
Madam, cook the food in the
Marlex Pressur Cooker..

296
00:29:54,921 --> 00:29:58,982
..for your beloved, he will
love you all his life.

297
00:30:01,094 --> 00:30:02,152
Cutie pie!

298
00:30:08,268 --> 00:30:10,202
Sonia and Ajit will
make a nice couple.

299
00:30:16,309 --> 00:30:19,210
''My dream girl! When will you come?''

300
00:30:19,312 --> 00:30:21,007
Mummy, dab some powder on dad.

301
00:30:21,114 --> 00:30:23,014
Powder? Your mom only butters me up.

302
00:30:24,117 --> 00:30:27,018
lt's men who butter up, not women.

303
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,021
lf Munna insists, l'll
dab some powder on you.

304
00:30:30,123 --> 00:30:32,023
And kohl, too.
- No, Munna.

305
00:30:32,125 --> 00:30:35,583
Your papa's eyes can see everything
clear without kohl, too.

306
00:30:35,962 --> 00:30:37,224
Far and near, too.

307
00:30:37,964 --> 00:30:41,593
Papa, it's said in the comic that
kohl helps improve sight.

308
00:30:41,968 --> 00:30:43,026
Will you keep reading
comics all day..

309
00:30:43,136 --> 00:30:44,262
..or will you get ready
to go to school?

310
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:45,359
Get going!

311
00:30:45,972 --> 00:30:47,200
Naughty boy!

312
00:30:49,309 --> 00:30:51,243
Look, don't irritate me
so early in the morning.

313
00:30:51,344 --> 00:30:54,609
Go for your duty straight away.
- l am doing my duty.

314
00:30:54,981 --> 00:30:58,041
No! - Don't be stubborn,
darling. - Let go!

315
00:31:16,002 --> 00:31:18,061
Ajit! Ajit!

316
00:31:21,174 --> 00:31:24,075
Bhabhi?
- Do you remember any other tune?

317
00:31:24,177 --> 00:31:25,644
You keep playing this
one all the time.

318
00:31:28,314 --> 00:31:34,082
No, Bhabhi, this is the only tune
that makes my heart beat.

319
00:31:35,188 --> 00:31:37,418
l see; so this tune is
related to your heart.

320
00:31:38,525 --> 00:31:42,086
Let me know the name of the girl
who has made my Ajit go crazy.

321
00:31:43,196 --> 00:31:46,290
l don't know her real name.

322
00:31:48,401 --> 00:31:49,925
But l used to call her Guddi..

323
00:31:50,036 --> 00:31:53,096
..and she called me Munna
when we were kids.

324
00:31:54,207 --> 00:31:57,108
We used to play together in
our village 15 years back.

325
00:31:59,045 --> 00:32:00,444
One day..

326
00:32:02,549 --> 00:32:03,948
Munna, we will be leaving
the village..

327
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:05,278
..and going to the
city in a few days.

328
00:32:06,386 --> 00:32:10,117
lf you go away, Guddi, what will
l do? Who will l play with?

329
00:32:11,224 --> 00:32:13,317
Wherever l go, l will keep visiting
this village often.

330
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:17,120
We will meet here every time.
- Promise? - God promise.

331
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:19,095
l hope you won't forget
me when you go away.

332
00:32:19,199 --> 00:32:22,327
Never. l also have a photo of yours.

333
00:32:23,436 --> 00:32:26,337
Will you always love me this much?
- Yes, l will.

334
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,704
You are lying; you will forget me.

335
00:32:30,076 --> 00:32:31,703
You don't even have my photo.

336
00:32:32,378 --> 00:32:38,339
''My love will never lessen.''

337
00:32:41,454 --> 00:32:45,481
''My love will never lessen.''

338
00:32:46,392 --> 00:32:50,158
''No matter where you stay
or where l stay.''

339
00:32:50,263 --> 00:32:55,166
''l will always love you.''

340
00:32:57,270 --> 00:33:00,728
''l will always remember you.''

341
00:33:02,408 --> 00:33:06,174
''l will always love you.''

342
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,748
''l will always remember you.''

343
00:33:11,417 --> 00:33:15,547
''My love will never lessen.''

344
00:33:16,656 --> 00:33:18,385
''My love will never lessen.''

345
00:33:21,494 --> 00:33:24,019
One day l returned home
from a school picnic..

346
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:26,155
..and found that Guddi
had left for the city.

347
00:33:27,267 --> 00:33:33,399
l ran after the bus.. and when
l saw Guddi.. l yelled.

348
00:33:35,441 --> 00:33:37,170
Guddi! Guddi!

349
00:33:37,277 --> 00:33:39,404
Munna, we will meet
at the same place.

350
00:33:40,513 --> 00:33:44,540
Guddi said only that, and
disappeared from my sight.

351
00:33:47,153 --> 00:33:48,780
lt's been 15 years now.

352
00:33:50,456 --> 00:33:55,052
Many girls passed my sight
in these 15 years..

353
00:33:55,161 --> 00:33:57,425
..but l never found my Guddi.

354
00:33:59,532 --> 00:34:01,056
Do you keep sitting here
and missing her..

355
00:34:01,167 --> 00:34:02,429
..or have you tried to look for her?

356
00:34:04,537 --> 00:34:05,799
l tried a lot, Bhabhi.

357
00:34:07,473 --> 00:34:10,067
l went to that place many a times..

358
00:34:10,176 --> 00:34:14,237
..but always returned disappointed.

359
00:34:14,347 --> 00:34:16,440
Ajit, this is an affection
of childhood.

360
00:34:16,549 --> 00:34:20,246
lt's possible Guddi might
have forgotten you by now.

361
00:34:21,354 --> 00:34:25,450
lf she had forgotten me, my
heart would have broken.

362
00:34:27,193 --> 00:34:29,320
l wouldn't remain so restless.

363
00:34:31,431 --> 00:34:35,834
l am sure l will find
Guddi some day.

364
00:34:48,214 --> 00:34:50,273
C'mon, baby.

365
00:35:03,763 --> 00:35:06,288
Wow! You've become a
perfect fighter now.

366
00:35:06,399 --> 00:35:09,493
No one can beat you.
- C'mon, brother!

367
00:35:09,602 --> 00:35:13,868
You're getting habituated
to being defeated by girls.

368
00:35:15,241 --> 00:35:20,304
You mean? - Take my word, bro,
and knock out this girl.

369
00:35:20,413 --> 00:35:22,506
Really, it will be fun.

370
00:35:23,616 --> 00:35:26,517
l won't befriend any girl
till l get you married.

371
00:35:26,619 --> 00:35:31,318
Will you keep imagining her
as your bride till then?

372
00:35:32,425 --> 00:35:36,657
Do this; confess your
love to Priti soon.

373
00:35:38,264 --> 00:35:41,529
Or she might marry someone
else and fly away.

374
00:35:42,635 --> 00:35:47,538
Let her go away; l don't want
any joy before your happiness.

375
00:35:49,642 --> 00:35:51,166
Brother, whether you
marry first or l..

376
00:35:51,277 --> 00:35:56,340
..will that lessen our
love for each other?

377
00:35:56,449 --> 00:35:59,350
No, dear, it's not that.

378
00:35:59,452 --> 00:36:02,353
Ajit is going to look for
Guddi once again today.

379
00:36:02,455 --> 00:36:05,549
Bless me, Bhabhi, that
l find her this time.

380
00:36:06,659 --> 00:36:07,921
May you find Guddi this time!

381
00:36:08,594 --> 00:36:11,188
But remember this; if you
don't find your Guddi..

382
00:36:11,297 --> 00:36:14,357
..you will have to marry the
girl l choose for you.

383
00:36:14,467 --> 00:36:16,367
How long will you keep
living on dreams?

384
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:21,372
You are going, but remember,
this is your last chance.

385
00:36:21,474 --> 00:36:24,568
After that it will be my choice
and your acceptance, ok?

386
00:36:25,311 --> 00:36:26,539
Wish me luck, Bhabhi.

387
00:36:26,646 --> 00:36:27,704
All the best.

388
00:36:35,822 --> 00:36:37,380
Ticket! Your ticket?

389
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:39,219
Nazo, the bus will leave now..

390
00:36:39,325 --> 00:36:42,954
..but the seat beside
mine is still empty.

391
00:36:43,329 --> 00:36:44,728
Come here; it will be fun.

392
00:36:45,331 --> 00:36:47,390
What if the person who has
booked the seat comes up?

393
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:50,401
He won't come now. - Yes, you
are right. He won't come now.

394
00:36:50,503 --> 00:36:52,596
lt will be really fun. Move.
- C'mon.

395
00:37:02,715 --> 00:37:04,615
God, don't make me return
empty handed this time.

396
00:37:05,351 --> 00:37:07,410
Please, help me find my lost love.

397
00:37:11,524 --> 00:37:12,650
Oh, this is a problem.

398
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:18,423
How much? Here.

399
00:37:18,531 --> 00:37:21,625
Excuse me, brother! Does the
bus to lgatpuri stand here?

400
00:37:21,734 --> 00:37:22,996
Yes, it left just now.

401
00:37:26,372 --> 00:37:31,435
'You are going, but remember,
this is your last chance.'

402
00:37:31,544 --> 00:37:34,638
'After that it will be my choice
and your acceptance, ok?'

403
00:39:04,837 --> 00:39:06,532
Thief! Thief!
- Don't be afraid; l am not a thief.

404
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:08,106
He is right; he's not a thief.
- Shut up!

405
00:39:08,474 --> 00:39:11,534
Are you my friend or his?
- l am your friend, but he is right.

406
00:39:11,644 --> 00:39:13,111
Thank you.
- Welcome. - Shut up!

407
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,540
Stop the bus! l'll die; stop
the bus. - Yes, stop the bus.

408
00:39:18,484 --> 00:39:19,712
Thank you.

409
00:39:22,822 --> 00:39:24,756
Thank you. Thank you.

410
00:39:25,491 --> 00:39:27,755
How were you left outside, brother?

411
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:30,761
l was left behind. - Behind? But
where are you coming from?

412
00:39:30,863 --> 00:39:32,763
l've come from above.
- From above directly?

413
00:39:32,865 --> 00:39:37,768
Conducter, ask this thief whether
he has a ticket for this bus.

414
00:39:38,871 --> 00:39:41,567
Do you have the ticket for this
bus, brother? - Yes, l do.

415
00:39:42,675 --> 00:39:45,143
Do they give tickets up, too?
- Yes, they do.

416
00:39:45,511 --> 00:39:47,775
lf you have, show me.
- l will.

417
00:39:53,886 --> 00:39:55,581
l recall now.

418
00:39:58,691 --> 00:40:00,784
lt's safe. Here.

419
00:40:01,894 --> 00:40:04,590
Hey, it's real. Seat no. 16.

420
00:40:06,699 --> 00:40:07,791
Driver, drive the bus.

421
00:40:11,904 --> 00:40:13,599
Where is my seat?
- Beside that madam.

422
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:15,837
Will you move?

423
00:40:16,542 --> 00:40:17,770
Thank you.

424
00:40:21,881 --> 00:40:24,611
Excuse me, Ms. Sweet Sixteen.
- Shut up!

425
00:40:24,717 --> 00:40:26,810
l am not talking about you;
l am talking about my seat.

426
00:40:27,553 --> 00:40:29,817
l am not going to move from here.
Sit wherever you want.

427
00:40:30,556 --> 00:40:32,820
l'm sorry, but l will sit just here.

428
00:40:33,559 --> 00:40:36,187
He is right; you will have
to stand up. - Shut up!

429
00:40:36,562 --> 00:40:39,827
Are you my friend or his?
- l am your friend, but he is right.

430
00:40:39,932 --> 00:40:43,197
Thank you. Arrogant lady!
Am l the thief or you?

431
00:40:43,569 --> 00:40:45,833
C'mon, this is too much. lt's
three much, it's four much.

432
00:40:45,938 --> 00:40:46,996
C'mon.

433
00:40:50,576 --> 00:40:51,873

''My love will never lessen.''

479
00:47:03,115 --> 00:47:04,844
Arjun, ever since you've
arrived here..

480
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:07,214
..there's peace in the city.

481
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:11,016
We haven't found any dead
body of any girl for long.

482
00:47:12,124 --> 00:47:14,024
Looks like your arrival
has scared the murderers.

483
00:47:14,126 --> 00:47:16,094
l am really pleased with your work.

484
00:47:17,196 --> 00:47:18,857
l will be happy the
day the dead body..

485
00:47:18,964 --> 00:47:23,230
..of that demon will be
sent for the post mortem.

486
00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:26,198
You are right, Arjun.

487
00:47:27,306 --> 00:47:32,243
And when you are here, that day
won't be far from us. l'm sure.

488
00:47:33,278 --> 00:47:34,870
Priti, if you become
anyone's partner..

489
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:38,245
..he can never lose the
dance competition.

490
00:47:40,285 --> 00:47:42,253
So l wish you'd become my
dance partner this time.

491
00:47:42,988 --> 00:47:46,617
l'm extremely sorry, Deepak.
l can't be your partner.

492
00:47:46,992 --> 00:47:51,622
Why, Priti? Do you want me to
lose the competition again?

493
00:47:51,997 --> 00:47:56,058
lt's not about your winning or
losing. lt's about a promise.

494
00:47:56,168 --> 00:47:59,069
l have promised a friend of
mine before talking to you.

495
00:47:59,171 --> 00:48:01,639
She must be coming with that guy.

496
00:48:02,007 --> 00:48:05,067
Ok. My bad luck.
- l'm sorry, Deepak.

497
00:48:09,014 --> 00:48:10,641
Yes, she's fine. Move!

498
00:48:14,987 --> 00:48:18,081
Who is that fatso bringing? Shucks!

499
00:48:21,026 --> 00:48:23,290
Priti, look! l've got a
dance partner for you.

500
00:48:36,408 --> 00:48:38,103
Will l be dancing with him?

501
00:48:44,216 --> 00:48:47,674
Hey ma'am, who do you think you are?

502
00:48:50,055 --> 00:48:51,283
Are you the only good dancer here?

503
00:48:51,390 --> 00:48:52,948
Thousands of girls will
stand in queue..

504
00:48:53,058 --> 00:48:56,323
..to dance with me if l signal once.

505
00:48:56,428 --> 00:48:58,328
Priti, he is right.
- Right what?

506
00:48:58,430 --> 00:49:00,330
Rascal! Fatso!

507
00:49:00,432 --> 00:49:07,133
Are you my friend or his?
- l am your friend, but he is right.

508
00:49:08,073 --> 00:49:09,301
Shut up!

509
00:49:10,409 --> 00:49:11,967
Take my word and participate..

510
00:49:12,077 --> 00:49:15,342
..in a Kabaddi game rather
than the dance competition.

511
00:49:16,448 --> 00:49:20,350
An irritable girl like you can't
win a dance competition.

512
00:49:20,452 --> 00:49:23,353
l will win the dance competition
and prove to you.

513
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:28,358
Got it?
- This girl has gone mad.

514
00:49:29,461 --> 00:49:34,364
Deepak! You wanted me to be your
dance partner, right? - Yes.

515
00:49:34,466 --> 00:49:37,731
l am ready.
- Really? Thanks.

516
00:49:41,406 --> 00:49:42,998
Now we will show this arrogant guy..

517
00:49:43,108 --> 00:49:47,169
..how a dance competition is won.

518
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:51,374
Dance competition..
- Will be won by you.

519
00:49:51,483 --> 00:49:54,384
Because Ajit..
- Doesn't know of defeat.

520
00:49:54,486 --> 00:49:56,010
By the way, fat body,
tell this fat brain..

521
00:49:56,121 --> 00:50:02,185
..that zero plus zero
does not add up to one.

522
00:50:03,295 --> 00:50:04,523
lt doesn't.

523
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:09,396
Zero and zero.. it can't be.

524
00:50:09,501 --> 00:50:13,403
Priti! Priti, he is right.

525
00:50:13,505 --> 00:50:14,529
You cheat!

526
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:21,409
Are you my friend or his?
- l am your friend, but he is right.

527
00:50:33,525 --> 00:50:36,790
What's the matter? You look
sad today. - What do l do?

528
00:50:37,462 --> 00:50:40,795
l haven't found a girl who
can be my dance partner.

529
00:50:42,167 --> 00:50:44,226
Looks like l'll lose
this competition.

530
00:50:44,336 --> 00:50:45,803
Don't you talk of losing!

531
00:50:46,171 --> 00:50:48,230
l hate defeat and so
does your brother.

532
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:52,242
l hate it, too. But.. l should
at least find a good girl.

533
00:50:52,344 --> 00:50:56,440
l will find the girl for you.
- You? - Yes.

534
00:50:56,548 --> 00:50:59,244
Sonia!
- Yes, Bhabhi?

535
00:51:03,355 --> 00:51:05,255
You two know each other well.

536
00:51:05,357 --> 00:51:08,087
l wish her to become your
partner in the dance..

537
00:51:08,193 --> 00:51:12,823
..and after the competition,
your life partner.

538
00:51:13,198 --> 00:51:14,495
But..

539
00:51:19,204 --> 00:51:20,466
What are you saying, Sonia?

540
00:51:20,572 --> 00:51:22,267
You want to marry Ajit..

541
00:51:22,374 --> 00:51:25,468
..the one who's never done
anything except flirting?

542
00:51:25,577 --> 00:51:27,477
He used to flirt with girl, bro.

543
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:32,482
But now he will marry only me.

544
00:51:33,585 --> 00:51:36,486
Even his Bhabhi approves
of this relationship.

545
00:51:37,522 --> 00:51:40,286
Think over again; it's a question
of your whole life.

546
00:51:40,392 --> 00:51:43,122
Brother, a sister who has
always followed the path..

547
00:51:43,228 --> 00:51:52,500
..set by a brother like you, can
she ever go wrong? - Never.

548
00:51:53,605 --> 00:51:56,130
Brother, Ajit's family wishes
that we get married..

549
00:51:56,241 --> 00:52:00,302
..after the inter-college
dance competition.

550
00:52:01,413 --> 00:52:03,313
lf that's what you wish, fine.

551
00:52:22,434 --> 00:52:25,335
''Love. Love.''

552
00:52:27,439 --> 00:52:30,533
''Love. Love.''

553

''When we looked in

560
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:17,220
''When we looked in each
other's eyes..''

561
00:53:17,322 --> 00:53:20,382
''..my heart got stunned.''

562
00:53:20,492 --> 00:53:24,588
''Our hearts promised each
other at first sight.''

563
00:53:25,697 --> 00:53:28,393

''The day l don't see your
face, l feel restless.''

572
00:54:34,399 --> 00:54:37,664
''l feel restless.''

573
00:54:38,770 --> 00:54:40,670
''Everyone stopped
me and advised me.''

574
00:54:40,772 --> 00:54:42,467
'' But l listened to my heart.''

575
00:54:42,574 --> 00:54:47,034
''l listened to my heart.
l listened to my heart.''

576
00:54:47,712 --> 00:54:51,671
''l acted foolish and gave away
my heart to a stranger.''

00:54:52,717 --> 00:54:56,483
''l acted foolish. How
foolish l acted!''

578

''You walk with a swagger.''

585
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:57,547
''Your gait is naughty.''

586
00:55:57,649 --> 00:56:00,117

Look, Sonia, l..

Ajit, everyone knows what
a big flirt you are.

661
01:03:35,106 --> 01:03:41,204
But, Priti, l never imagined you
could be so wicked and low.

662
01:03:41,312 --> 01:03:46,215
Sonia! You are saying too much
without knowing the truth.

663
01:03:46,317 --> 01:03:48,012
Mind your language.

664
01:03:48,119 --> 01:03:49,848
A girl who takes away
some one's love..

665
01:03:49,954 --> 01:03:53,014
..what else she would be if not low?

666

Sonia! Watch your words!
- Shut up!

667
01:03:56,994 --> 01:03:59,690
l will say it a thousand times.

Priti is low! She is a scoundrel!

669
01:04:24,655 --> 01:04:25,883
What have you done, Ajit?

670
01:04:25,990 --> 01:04:32,725
Priti, l can't bear anyone
saying rubbish to you.

671
01:04:35,833 --> 01:04:37,733
Yet, l'll ask her pardon.

672
01:04:37,835 --> 01:04:41,737
What did you say? Ajit beat you?

673
01:04:41,839 --> 01:04:44,307
l will kill him.
- No, brother!

674
01:04:44,675 --> 01:04:49,908
Why not? l had told you
that Ajit is a big flirt.

675
01:04:51,015 --> 01:04:52,915
But you didn't believe me.

676
01:04:53,017 --> 01:04:56,578
Now you have spoilt
your happy life..

677
01:04:56,687 --> 01:04:58,951
..by trusting an unfamiliar guy.

678
01:04:59,690 --> 01:05:05,754
lf l have spoilt my life, brother,
l will correct it.

679
01:05:11,702 --> 01:05:13,932
Hello.
- Hello. lt's Sonia speaking.

680
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:18,338
Sonia? l was just going to call you.

681
01:05:19,710 --> 01:05:20,768
l wanted to tell you that..

682
01:05:20,878 --> 01:05:24,780
..whatever you saw and
guessed was all wrong.

683
01:05:24,882 --> 01:05:27,350
Look, l don't want to hear
any thing over the phone.

684
01:05:27,718 --> 01:05:30,983
l want to meet you.
- Where?

685
01:05:32,089 --> 01:05:34,785
At Madh lsland, at 5 o'clock
in the evening.

686
01:05:35,893 --> 01:05:38,794
Sorry; l told you a love
story in between.

687
01:05:38,896 --> 01:05:40,625
That's because our wicked man..

688
01:05:40,731 --> 01:05:43,791
..had gone out of town
for a few days.

689
01:05:43,901 --> 01:05:47,962
Now he's back. That means
our old story continues.

690
01:05:49,073 --> 01:05:50,802
The fireworks start again.

691
01:05:52,910 --> 01:05:54,707
What did you say? l
said it in English.

692
01:05:54,812 --> 01:06:00,011
Sir, your going abroad felt like
all the fun had gone away from here.

693
01:06:01,052 --> 01:06:02,644
The police also calmed down..

694
01:06:02,753 --> 01:06:04,380
..when they didn't find
any girl's dead body.

695
01:06:04,755 --> 01:06:07,019
Let's ruin their peace right now.

696
01:06:50,801 --> 01:06:52,029
Wow!

697
01:07:03,147 --> 01:07:04,444
Wow!

698
01:07:06,817 --> 01:07:13,086
What a fish! This fish will
get trapped in the net.

699
01:08:22,259 --> 01:08:23,783
Looks like this is the same gang..

700
01:08:23,894 --> 01:08:25,521
..which kidnaps girls
in broad day light.

701
01:08:25,896 --> 01:08:29,161
Beware! Don't you move forward!

702
01:08:29,266 --> 01:08:32,963
l am not a girl you can
kidnap from here alive.

703
01:08:34,071 --> 01:08:36,164
No, no fights.

704
01:08:36,273 --> 01:08:40,175
Girls like you are not made
for fights, but for loving.

705
01:08:41,278 --> 01:08:42,802
And bad people like you..

706
01:08:42,913 --> 01:08:46,178
..are not worth talking to,
but rather getting kicked.

707
01:08:57,294 --> 01:09:00,991
Hello. - Hello. lt's inspector
Mishra speaking. - Yes, tell me.

708
01:09:01,098 --> 01:09:02,827
The murderous gang..

709
01:09:02,933 --> 01:09:04,560
..has attacked a girl
here on Madh lsland.

710
01:09:04,935 --> 01:09:07,199
l am going to help her; please,
come immediately. Over.

711
01:09:07,304 --> 01:09:08,362
l'm just reaching.

712
01:10:05,996 --> 01:10:07,258
Let go of me!

713
01:10:19,310 --> 01:10:20,436
Let go!

714
01:10:25,549 --> 01:10:27,278
Let go of me! Let go!

715
01:10:29,019 --> 01:10:30,316
Let go of me!

716
01:10:50,441 --> 01:10:54,104
Brother Arjun?
- The rascals ran away! - Thank you.

717
01:10:54,211 --> 01:10:56,941
Thank you very much. lf you
hadn't arrived on time..

718
01:10:57,047 --> 01:10:58,674
..don't know what could've happened.

719
01:11:00,050 --> 01:11:01,677
What would happen if
l hadn't arrived?

720
01:11:02,052 --> 01:11:05,681
Had you come here to practice judo?
- l had come to meet Ajit.

721
01:11:06,056 --> 01:11:08,115
And that idiot hasn't arrived?
- No.

722
01:11:08,225 --> 01:11:10,125
You know this is a dangerous area.

723
01:11:11,228 --> 01:11:14,129
You shouldn't have come here alone.
- Yes.

724
01:11:14,231 --> 01:11:16,131
Come, l'll drop you home.

725
01:11:22,239 --> 01:11:25,140
l'll get you two married soon, so
that you don't have to roam alone.

726
01:11:26,076 --> 01:11:27,304
No!

727
01:11:34,084 --> 01:11:36,348
Sonia, are you ok?
- Yes. - Are you sure?

728
01:11:36,453 --> 01:11:39,354
l'm ok; don't worry about
me. Follow that man.

729
01:11:39,456 --> 01:11:40,480
Please, go.

730
01:12:14,124 --> 01:12:15,421
Sonia?!

731
01:12:15,526 --> 01:12:18,393
Sonia! Who fired at you, Sonia?

732
01:12:19,129 --> 01:12:21,188
l am running out of time.

733
01:12:21,298 --> 01:12:27,396
Just tell me this. Why
did you cheat me?

734
01:12:28,505 --> 01:12:31,201
No, Sonia, l haven't cheated you.
You misunderstood me.

735
01:12:31,308 --> 01:12:33,208
Whatever you saw and
understood was wrong.

736
01:12:33,310 --> 01:12:35,210
Priti is my lost love
of my childhood.

737
01:12:36,313 --> 01:12:40,545
l swear on you; neither Priti is of
bad character nor am l a cheat.

738
01:12:42,152 --> 01:12:46,782
lt's my life that has deceived
me; it isn't supporting me.

739
01:12:48,158 --> 01:12:51,423
l have no grudges against you now.

740
01:12:52,529 --> 01:12:57,228
As it is.. what use is
this life without you?

741
01:13:00,337 --> 01:13:07,800
May God keep you and Priti together
till the end of your lives!

742
01:13:08,178 --> 01:13:12,239
Your.. elder brother..

743
01:13:15,463 --> 01:13:17,556
Sonia! Sonia!

744
01:13:47,328 --> 01:13:48,955
What's the matter, doctor?
You look tensed.

745
01:13:49,630 --> 01:13:55,967
l am not tensed; l am rather
surprised. - Surprised? - Yes.

746
01:13:56,637 --> 01:14:00,573
A very fine particle of a bullet
is stuck in your brother's brain.

747
01:14:01,342 --> 01:14:02,969
A particle of a bullet?

748
01:14:03,344 --> 01:14:06,404
And that's the cause of your
brother's passing out.

749
01:14:13,521 --> 01:14:16,615
Anita, l was lucky that..
- Brother! This..

750
01:14:17,358 --> 01:14:18,586
l know what you want to ask.

751
01:14:19,694 --> 01:14:21,992
ls this true?
- Yes, it is.

752
01:14:22,663 --> 01:14:24,631
A scoundrel had fired
many bullets on me.

753
01:14:24,732 --> 01:14:26,632
You can say your brother
was saved with luck.

754
01:14:32,740 --> 01:14:35,436
That means our sister..
- Didn't die due to a disease.

755
01:14:42,383 --> 01:14:44,283
After our sister died
and l got injured..

756
01:14:44,385 --> 01:14:47,650
..that masked man went
away from Delhi.

757
01:14:49,757 --> 01:14:52,282
Such a big incident happened
in our family..

758
01:14:52,393 --> 01:14:54,452
..but you didn't even let
me know. Why, brother?

759
01:14:54,562 --> 01:14:56,655
Because you were busy with
your study at that time.

760
01:14:57,398 --> 01:15:00,458
My study was not more important
than my brother and sister.

761
01:15:01,569 --> 01:15:04,663
Excuse me, please. Visiting
time is over. - Ok.

762
01:15:09,777 --> 01:15:12,302
And l vowed that very day that..

763
01:15:12,413 --> 01:15:14,677
..l'd remove the bullet particles
from my brain later.

764
01:15:16,784 --> 01:15:18,684
First l'll kill that bastard.

765
01:15:18,853 --> 01:15:23,483
Brother, you aren't alone in this
war to terminate this gang.

766
01:15:25,426 --> 01:15:26,688
l am also with you.

767
01:15:26,794 --> 01:15:29,319
Sir, the one responsible for
our successive failures..

768
01:15:29,430 --> 01:15:32,695
..is called lnspector Arjun Singh.

769
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:37,703
Arjun Singh! The same one
whom we blasted in Delhi?

770
01:15:38,806 --> 01:15:48,704
Yes. - Oh! So he escaped. But
now his escape is impossible.

771
01:15:52,820 --> 01:15:54,685
Constable, take off the sheet.

772
01:16:01,796 --> 01:16:06,096
ls she? - Yes lnspector.
This is my sister Sonia.

773
01:16:06,767 --> 01:16:09,531
Could you tell me why she
went to Mudh lsland?

774
01:16:10,638 --> 01:16:16,099
To meet Ajeet.
- To meet Ajeet! Oh, l see.

775
01:16:16,477 --> 01:16:19,105
Why did you react when l mentioned
Ajeet, lnspector?

776
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:21,380
The pistol we found next
to your sister's body..

777
01:16:21,482 --> 01:16:23,541
..has Ajeet's fingerprints on it.

778
01:16:24,652 --> 01:16:28,383
Ajeet, you have snatched
my sister away from me..

779
01:16:28,489 --> 01:16:31,754
..l shall snatch your life from you.

780
01:16:32,860 --> 01:16:37,559
Ajeet! Ajeet! Where are you?
Come forward, Ajeet!

781
01:16:37,665 --> 01:16:41,567
Ajeet!
- What's the matter, Hemant?

782
01:16:43,671 --> 01:16:46,765
You. You have snatched
my sister from me.

783
01:16:47,875 --> 01:16:51,572
Today l shall snatch your
life from you, scoundrel.

784
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:55,774
What rubbish is this? l have
committed Sonia's murder?!

785
01:16:56,517 --> 01:16:58,576
Then did she die on her own accord?

786
01:16:58,686 --> 01:17:00,551
What had she ever done to you?

787
01:17:02,656 --> 01:17:05,750
You considered her a pebble on
the road and got rid of her.

788
01:17:05,860 --> 01:17:06,918
Tell me.

789
01:17:09,830 --> 01:17:11,764
This is the last time l
am telling you, Hemant.

790
01:17:12,867 --> 01:17:16,166
l didn't murder Sonia. ln fact a
gang of assassins has done it.

791
01:17:16,837 --> 01:17:22,798
Don't teach me how girls die at
the hands of assassins. Get it?

792
01:17:27,548 --> 01:17:30,449
Hemant, l still tell you
to stop your hands..

793
01:17:30,551 --> 01:17:32,610
..or l haven't worn bangles
in my hands either.

794
01:17:33,721 --> 01:17:35,814
lf you haven't worn bangles
then raise your hands!

795
01:17:35,923 --> 01:17:37,823
Raise your hands! Raise them!

796
01:18:26,974 --> 01:18:28,874
What's happening here?

797
01:18:29,610 --> 01:18:32,670
He has murdered my sister.
l won't let him live.

798
01:18:33,781 --> 01:18:38,684
You are mistaken. l was present
when Sonia was shot.

799
01:18:39,620 --> 01:18:40,848
Ajeet wasn't even there.

800
01:18:40,955 --> 01:18:42,889
Then how did his fingerprints
get on the pistol?

801
01:18:43,991 --> 01:18:46,892
Ajeet came there later and
accidentally picked up the pistol.

802
01:18:47,995 --> 01:18:51,260
Trust me. l shall arrest Sonia's
murderer in a few days.

803
01:18:52,633 --> 01:18:55,261
All right. l respect you.

804
01:18:55,936 --> 01:18:58,530
But if you don't present
the real murderer to me..

805
01:18:58,639 --> 01:19:01,904
..in two weeks, l will take it
that Ajeet is the murderer.

806
01:19:03,010 --> 01:19:05,706
Then your entire police force
won't be able to harm me.

807
01:19:10,818 --> 01:19:12,911
Okay. See you.
- May l come in, sir?

808
01:19:14,021 --> 01:19:16,717
Hey Arjun. Welcome!
Welcome! Welcome!

809
01:19:16,824 --> 01:19:18,291
Many happy returns of the day.
- Thank you.

810
01:19:18,659 --> 01:19:19,921
Thank you very much,
Arjun. Thank you.

811
01:19:20,027 --> 01:19:21,927
Oh Arjun, we've received a gift.

812
01:19:22,029 --> 01:19:24,725
And the sender left instructions
to open it in your presence.

813
01:19:24,832 --> 01:19:26,299
Only then it will be enjoyable.

814
01:19:26,667 --> 01:19:28,726
lf it is enjoyable only that
way then let's open it.

815
01:19:28,836 --> 01:19:30,736
Yes. Let's have a look.

816
01:19:31,672 --> 01:19:32,934
Yes sir.
- Hey, please open that gift.

817
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:34,098
Sure sir.

818
01:20:01,702 --> 01:20:05,604
Commissioner, please accept
this gift on your birthday..

819
01:20:05,706 --> 01:20:10,769
..and remember, the girl whom
we eye doesn't remain alive..

820
01:20:10,878 --> 01:20:14,780
..on this earth for too many days.

821
01:20:14,882 --> 01:20:18,613
And Arjun Singh, l'd gone
out for a few days..

822
01:20:18,719 --> 01:20:24,351
..stop me if you can.

823
01:20:30,731 --> 01:20:33,996
l'll stop you! l will
surely stop you!

824
01:20:37,738 --> 01:20:39,035
Let go off me, scoundrel.

825
01:20:43,143 --> 01:20:45,008
l'm sorry. l can't say
anything at this time.

826
01:20:46,113 --> 01:20:49,014
Tomorrow l'll give my statement
to the press. Okay.

827
01:20:51,752 --> 01:20:53,151
No!

828
01:20:58,759 --> 01:21:01,387
What? lnspector Ram Singh
has been killed?!

829
01:21:02,763 --> 01:21:04,060
No!

830
01:21:05,766 --> 01:21:07,165
Oh Damn it!

831
01:21:13,273 --> 01:21:16,834
The fish will be trapped in the net.

832
01:21:30,791 --> 01:21:32,088
Leave me.

833
01:21:46,206 --> 01:21:48,868
You want to tie my hands and
have all the fun on your own?

834
01:21:49,977 --> 01:21:53,071
lt appears as if you are used
to clapping with only one hand.

835
01:21:53,814 --> 01:21:55,042
What do you mean?

836
01:21:56,150 --> 01:22:03,079
l mean when one claps with
both hands it's more fun.

837
01:22:04,191 --> 01:22:07,217
Great! You are the first girl
l know who talks this way.

838
01:22:08,328 --> 01:22:12,094
l think it will be great
fun to make love to you.

839
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:15,725
You will enjoy so much..

840
01:22:15,836 --> 01:22:19,897
..this will become a memorable
moment to you.

841
01:22:21,008 --> 01:22:25,104
Even if you wish to forget me
all your life you couldn't.

842
01:22:26,213 --> 01:22:29,478
You will always remember each
and every move l make.

843
01:22:30,851 --> 01:22:32,478
You are extremely hot.

844
01:22:32,853 --> 01:22:41,124
Hot! First untie my hands
then watch my heat.

845
01:22:43,864 --> 01:22:45,126
Come.

846
01:23:08,255 --> 01:23:14,160
Now where will you escape?
- l say stop. Or. Or l shall jump.

847
01:23:15,262 --> 01:23:16,786
Don't be stupid, girl.
lf you jump from here..

848
01:23:16,897 --> 01:23:19,525
..you're bones will be smashed.

849
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:24,159
Let them. But l won't allow a
devil like you to victimize me.

850
01:23:26,273 --> 01:23:29,174
That is exactly what
drives me crazy.

851
01:23:29,910 --> 01:23:32,174
Let me go. Let me go, you scoundrel!

852
01:24:38,979 --> 01:24:40,276
Who are you?

853
01:24:44,985 --> 01:24:46,612
l asked you. Who are you?

854
01:24:47,287 --> 01:24:51,246
lnspector Arjun Singh.
- Oh! Come in. Come in.

855
01:24:54,361 --> 01:24:56,226
Tell me, what brings you here?

856
01:24:58,332 --> 01:25:02,268
l was chasing an assassin
but l found you.

857
01:25:05,372 --> 01:25:08,273
Since l've found you l shall
find the assassin too.

858
01:25:09,376 --> 01:25:12,277
What are trying to say?
What do you mean?

859
01:25:16,383 --> 01:25:20,911
l mean that you have worn
a mask of respectability..

860
01:25:21,021 --> 01:25:27,290
..but you were unable to
wipe the smudges of muck.

861
01:25:28,395 --> 01:25:30,920
One who has a habit of
walking in the garden..

862
01:25:31,031 --> 01:25:33,090
..is bound to have smudges of muck.

863
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:35,930
A person's habits can lead him
from being behind bars..

864
01:25:36,036 --> 01:25:38,300
..right up to heaven.

865
01:25:40,407 --> 01:25:42,932
The man whom l followed
and arrived here..

866
01:25:43,043 --> 01:25:49,312
..is the gruesome criminal
hood man. And he..

867
01:25:49,416 --> 01:25:52,317
And l am that hood man. ls that
what you wish to state?

868
01:25:53,420 --> 01:25:54,944
On seeing the muck on the shoes..

869
01:25:55,055 --> 01:25:57,319
..you made a mountain
of a mole hill.

870
01:25:57,424 --> 01:26:00,120
And you come to our
house and insult us.

871
01:26:02,229 --> 01:26:04,322
Who is he?
- He is our daddy.

872
01:26:06,066 --> 01:26:08,330
Oh, so he is your daddy.

873
01:26:09,069 --> 01:26:10,331
My girl.
- Yes.

874
01:26:10,437 --> 01:26:12,337
You shouldn't mind
what the cops say.

875
01:26:12,439 --> 01:26:14,339
lt is their habit to be suspicious.

876
01:26:15,375 --> 01:26:20,142
But lnspector, suspecting
me is going over the limit.

877
01:26:23,250 --> 01:26:29,348
All right. Today l shall leave but
protect your self from muck.

878
01:26:35,462 --> 01:26:37,362
Keep a sharp eye on this house.
- Yes sir.

879
01:26:42,102 --> 01:26:43,330
Papa.

880
01:26:43,437 --> 01:26:45,371
Have you ever seen Mr. Bear?

881
01:26:46,473 --> 01:26:48,168
Mr. Bear. Do you mean
the one at the zoo?

882
01:26:49,276 --> 01:26:53,372
Not that, papa. This Mr. Bear
is half human and half bear.

883
01:26:53,480 --> 01:26:56,176
He is very dangerous. He
doesn't lose to anyone.

884
01:26:56,283 --> 01:26:59,013
ls that so? - Yes papa, and
it says in the comics..

885
01:26:59,119 --> 01:27:02,179
..no one can kill him, not
even with a sword or a gun.

886
01:27:02,289 --> 01:27:06,749
Munna, a comic is a comic, get it.
lt's not the truth. Forget it.

887
01:27:08,128 --> 01:27:10,528
Papa, please ask me how
does the Mr. Bear die.

888
01:27:11,631 --> 01:27:17,399
Well then tell me, Munna, how does
Mr. Bear die in your comic?

889
01:27:18,138 --> 01:27:21,437
Tell me.
- By attacking his eyes.

890
01:27:21,541 --> 01:27:23,406
Because his life is in his eyes.

891
01:27:24,444 --> 01:27:26,378
ls that so?
- Yes papa.

892
01:27:28,148 --> 01:27:30,207
What are the father
and son discussing?

893
01:27:31,318 --> 01:27:33,286
Shall l tell your mummy?
- No papa.

894
01:27:33,386 --> 01:27:37,220
What won't you tell? - That Mr.
Bear's life is in his eyes.

895
01:27:37,324 --> 01:27:39,053
You are discussing comics
again. Go to bed.

896
01:27:39,159 --> 01:27:40,387
You have school tomorrow morning.

897
01:27:40,494 --> 01:27:42,428
Good night papa.
- Come on. Come on. Hurry.

898
01:27:45,165 --> 01:27:47,429
Good night mummy.
- Good night.

899
01:28:11,558 --> 01:28:12,616
Who's calling so late at night?

900
01:28:13,193 --> 01:28:15,423
Hello. Arjun speaking.

901
01:28:16,530 --> 01:28:19,260
What? l'll come there just now.

902
01:28:39,386 --> 01:28:42,844
Where is her family?
- Her father is standing there.

903
01:28:53,533 --> 01:28:58,300
Sir.
- lnspector, what's happening?

904
01:28:58,405 --> 01:29:00,498
What are the Bombay police doing?

905
01:29:00,607 --> 01:29:02,507
We are making the best
effort on our part.

906
01:29:02,609 --> 01:29:04,873
You are making efforts but
what is the outcome?

907
01:29:05,245 --> 01:29:08,510
That scoundrel victimizes
innocent girls everyday.

908
01:29:08,615 --> 01:29:13,314
And the police.. - That fiend
won't escape from the police.

909
01:29:15,422 --> 01:29:19,882
The hands of the law are very long.
Please be patient, sir.

910
01:29:21,261 --> 01:29:23,525
lt's easy to console another.

911
01:29:23,630 --> 01:29:26,155
lf this had happened to
your sister or daughter..

912
01:29:26,266 --> 01:29:29,895
..you'd comprehend the fire
burning in my chest.

913
01:29:31,271 --> 01:29:34,536
Such a fire has been burning
in my chest for years.

914
01:29:35,642 --> 01:29:39,908
Your fire and mine will
be doused together now.

915
01:29:41,581 --> 01:29:44,175
Whether that scoundrel is in
the sky or the nether world..

916
01:29:44,284 --> 01:29:45,683
..l shall find him.

917
01:29:46,786 --> 01:29:48,549
Don't worry about the expenses,
lnspector.

918
01:29:48,655 --> 01:29:52,352
No matter what it costs to nab
that fiend, l shall bear it.

919
01:29:55,462 --> 01:29:58,192
Sir, there's an article
in this morning's paper..

920
01:29:58,298 --> 01:30:00,357
..Mr. Laxmichand of this
city has proclaimed..

921
01:30:00,467 --> 01:30:03,368
..anyone who nabs you shall
receive a reward from him..

922
01:30:03,470 --> 01:30:05,563
..of one and a half million in cash.

923
01:31:07,367 --> 01:31:08,664
lndeed!

924
01:31:08,768 --> 01:31:10,633
The fish shall be
trapped in the net.

925
01:31:36,763 --> 01:31:41,462
You got scared?
- Ajeet, don't ever do that again.

926
01:31:41,568 --> 01:31:42,796
l won't, my dear.

927
01:31:44,404 --> 01:31:45,701
Ajeet.
- What's the matter?

928
01:31:45,805 --> 01:31:47,670
What are you up to, Ajeet?

929
01:31:49,776 --> 01:31:54,042
For whom are these beautiful eyes?
- For you.

930
01:32:00,420 --> 01:32:03,651
And these pink lips? -
For you.

931
01:32:07,761 --> 01:32:11,492
And this glowing face?
- This is also for you.

932
01:32:15,602 --> 01:32:18,503
And this lovely body?

933
01:32:19,606 --> 01:32:22,666
Ajeet, you are in a very
romantic mood today.

934
01:32:22,776 --> 01:32:25,711
Today you're intentions don't
appear to be very good.

935
01:32:26,813 --> 01:32:31,716
Come close and l'll tell you
what my intentions are. - No.

936
01:32:37,657 --> 01:32:38,749
''Well then come close.''

937
01:32:38,858 --> 01:32:39,847
''Come.''

938
01:32:44,664 --> 01:32:52,696
''Come on. Come close.''

939
01:33:03,750 --> 01:33:06,981
''How will we make love
at this distance?''

940
01:33:08,087 --> 01:33:11,648
''How will we make love
at this distance?''

941
01:33:13,026 --> 01:33:16,120
''O Lord, now l cannot
wait any longer.''

942
01:33:17,230 --> 01:33:19,391
''When everything l have
belongs to you.''

943
01:33:19,499 --> 01:33:22,400
''And everything you
have belongs to me.''

944
01:33:22,502 --> 01:33:25,596
''Then why are you afraid? Why
do you say, no, no, no?''

945
01:33:26,940 --> 01:33:34,608
''My dear how will this do? My
dear how will this do at all?''

946
01:33:36,182 --> 01:33:39,413
''How can the heart talk
to the heart this way?''

947
01:33:40,520 --> 01:33:44,422
''Tell me. How can the heart
talk to the heart this way?''

948
01:33:45,525 --> 01:33:48,619
''lt will rain when the
season arrives.''

949
01:33:49,996 --> 01:33:54,433
''The heart is insane.
Explain to the heart.''

950
01:33:54,534 --> 01:33:58,436
''Anything can happen
in love. No. No. No.''

951
01:33:59,539 --> 01:34:07,105
''My dear how will this do? My
dear how will this do at all?''

952
01:34:36,242 --> 01:34:40,474
''Your childhood is gone. Your
childishness isn't gone.''

953
01:34:40,580 --> 01:34:45,483
''You don't know what is youth.''

954
01:34:45,585 --> 01:34:49,715
''You don't know what is youth.''

955
01:34:49,822 --> 01:34:53,952
''You need not tell me.
l know everything.''

956
01:34:54,060 --> 01:34:57,962
'' But l don't want to be
sweet talked by you.''

957
01:34:58,064 --> 01:35:01,158
''No. No. No. No. No.''

958
01:35:03,937 --> 01:35:07,964
''l can't control my heart no
matter what?'' - ''Really?''

959
01:35:09,208 --> 01:35:12,507
''l can't control my heart
no matter what?''

960
01:35:12,612 --> 01:35:15,979
''Suppress the desire of your
heart in your heart.''

961
01:35:18,551 --> 01:35:21,520
''When everything l have
belongs to you.''

962
01:35:21,621 --> 01:35:24,522
''And everything you
have belongs to me.''

963
01:35:24,624 --> 01:35:26,524
''Then why are you afraid? Why
do you say, no, no, no?''

964
01:35:27,627 --> 01:35:35,727
''My dear how will this do? My
dear how will this do at all?''

965
01:35:57,323 --> 01:36:06,027
''l'm surprised the flames of love
that are here aren't there.''

966
01:36:06,132 --> 01:36:10,762
''Those that are here aren't there.''

967
01:36:10,870 --> 01:36:15,239
''Even if the heart wishes
it how can we meet?''

968
01:36:15,341 --> 01:36:22,975
''This world won't permit us as yet.
Won't permit us as yet.''

969
01:36:25,018 --> 01:36:28,749
''When will this sanctuary
of embarrassment break?''

970
01:36:28,855 --> 01:36:33,087
''When will this sanctuary
of embarrassment break?''

971
01:36:34,293 --> 01:36:37,785
''When you wear ceremonial dress.''

972
01:36:39,232 --> 01:36:40,597
''When everything l have
belongs to you.''

973
01:36:40,700 --> 01:36:43,601
''And everything you
have belongs to me.''

974
01:36:43,703 --> 01:36:46,263
''Then why are you afraid? Why
do you say, no, no, no?''

975
01:36:48,641 --> 01:36:52,600
''My dear how will this do? My
dear how will this do at all?''

976
01:36:52,712 --> 01:36:56,307
''My dear how will this do? My
dear how will this do at all?''

977
01:37:17,870 --> 01:37:19,929
What's the matter? Why are
you walking with us?

978
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:23,304
This is a public beach, sir.
And we are the public.

979
01:37:24,410 --> 01:37:26,640
May l ask you something?
You won't mind, will you?

980
01:37:26,746 --> 01:37:29,340
Do you love your life?
- What do you mean?

981
01:37:30,683 --> 01:37:34,813
Look sir, we have orders from
the top to bring in this girl.

982
01:37:36,923 --> 01:37:39,653
Now you will lose control of your
senses due to your youth.

983
01:37:39,759 --> 01:37:42,193
That would mean danger
to your life, get it.

984
01:37:53,706 --> 01:37:54,730
Get lost!

985
01:38:00,780 --> 01:38:02,873
Preeti, go and inform
the police. Go!

986
01:39:44,150 --> 01:39:45,845
What happened to him?
What happened?

987
01:39:45,952 --> 01:39:47,442
ls this the reason we came here?

988
01:39:47,553 --> 01:39:49,783
We've already lost Bindu. Now if
anything happens to my Ajeet..

989
01:39:49,889 --> 01:39:52,380
..l will never forgive
you all my life.

990
01:39:52,491 --> 01:39:53,788
Be brave. Nothing will happen.
Take him away quickly.

991
01:39:53,893 --> 01:39:55,383
Nurse, hurry up.

992
01:39:55,828 --> 01:39:57,295
How did this happen?

993
01:39:58,231 --> 01:40:00,927
Sir, the gang that snatches the
girls is responsible for this.

994
01:40:01,033 --> 01:40:04,833
Thanks to Ajeet, we now have
a living member of that gang.

995
01:40:06,138 --> 01:40:07,503
l don't know, sir. l don't know.

996
01:40:08,608 --> 01:40:09,802
Sir, l don't know. Sir.

997
01:40:09,909 --> 01:40:11,809
This is the last time
l am asking you..

998
01:40:11,911 --> 01:40:12,935
..tell me where is hood
man's hideaway? Tell me.

999
01:40:13,045 --> 01:40:14,307
Sir. Sir, no one knows
hood man's hideaway.

1000
01:40:15,181 --> 01:40:16,808
l know the man who works
under him, sir.

1001
01:40:17,583 --> 01:40:19,813
Who is it?
- Sir. Sir. l'll tell you, sir.

1002
01:40:29,195 --> 01:40:31,356
Welcome lnspector. Welcome.

1003
01:40:32,932 --> 01:40:34,832
l was certain you would
definitely come here.

1004
01:40:35,935 --> 01:40:39,837
You have reached here
but to get to me..

1005
01:40:39,939 --> 01:40:43,966
..you will need to break
a very strong wall. This.

1006
01:40:49,081 --> 01:40:52,847
For your actions towards
my brother..

1007
01:40:52,952 --> 01:40:56,183
..you and your goons will
surely be punished.

1008
01:41:51,544 --> 01:41:56,914
lnspector, those in possession
of death don't die. Get it?

1009
01:42:40,259 --> 01:42:41,283
He is unconscious. Rascal.

1010
01:42:44,463 --> 01:42:46,954
What did you say? Tej Singh
has been arrested.

1011
01:42:48,067 --> 01:42:50,297
Yes sir, and the cops have taken
charge of the hideaway.

1012
01:42:52,071 --> 01:42:55,097
Arjun Singh, you must be happy
about nabbing my men..

1013
01:42:55,207 --> 01:42:58,108
..but now l shall toy with your
joys in such a manner..

1014
01:42:58,210 --> 01:43:01,976
..that you won't even
get a chance to cry.

1015
01:43:05,084 --> 01:43:06,244
Doctor, how is Ajeet?

1016
01:43:07,086 --> 01:43:08,110
He is out of danger..

1017
01:43:08,220 --> 01:43:10,984
..but l had to amputate his
left arm to save his life.

1018
01:43:11,624 --> 01:43:12,989
Oh no! Oh!

1019
01:44:07,146 --> 01:44:11,048
Hey brother, it's you.
- How are you? How are you feeling?

1020
01:44:11,684 --> 01:44:15,051
Perfectly all right. But what's
this? Tears in your eyes?

1021
01:44:16,155 --> 01:44:18,646
Tears. No. No.

1022
01:44:20,159 --> 01:44:22,457
Brother, l know why you
have tears in your eyes.

1023
01:44:23,696 --> 01:44:26,062
Because one of my arms has
been amputated, isn't it?

1024
01:44:28,167 --> 01:44:29,191
But if your are with me..

1025
01:44:29,301 --> 01:44:31,599
..what difference does it make
if one arm is amputated?

1026
01:44:32,705 --> 01:44:36,072
Ajeet, one brother is the
hand on another brother.

1027
01:44:38,511 --> 01:44:41,605
Still, never lose courage
in your life.

1028
01:44:43,449 --> 01:44:46,077
No strength in the world
is mightier than courage.

1029
01:44:47,186 --> 01:44:50,087
Brother, as long as your
hand is on my head..

1030
01:44:50,189 --> 01:44:52,089
..how can l lose courage?

1031
01:44:55,728 --> 01:44:58,424
What? He is still unconscious.
What nonsense?

1032
01:45:00,199 --> 01:45:02,224
Tell the doctors to
somehow revive him.

1033
01:45:03,469 --> 01:45:04,493
You can go now.
- Yes sir.

1034
01:45:28,561 --> 01:45:32,122
No Preeti. Now this hand
isn't worthy of you.

1035
01:45:36,769 --> 01:45:42,401
Oh! So you wish to test me. lf
that is the case, then listen..

1036
01:45:42,508 --> 01:45:47,138
..l love you hundreds and thousands
of times what l did.

1037
01:45:47,246 --> 01:45:51,148
You sacrificed your arm
to protect my honor.

1038
01:45:52,585 --> 01:45:54,610
l am proud that you are so brave.

1039
01:45:55,788 --> 01:45:57,278
l'm so proud of you.
- But..

1040
01:45:58,457 --> 01:46:02,291
Enough. Don't say anything more.
l love you. Understand.

1041
01:46:03,262 --> 01:46:05,162
Don't you understand l love you?

1042
01:46:07,600 --> 01:46:09,158
l love you, Preeti. l love you.
- Ajeet.

1043
01:46:12,605 --> 01:46:14,163
Anita, l am going.

1044
01:46:15,274 --> 01:46:16,434
Listen, you haven't
that list, have you?

1045
01:46:17,276 --> 01:46:19,369
How can l forget that list?

1046
01:46:21,280 --> 01:46:24,181
And you know this is Munna's
first birthday in Mumbai.

1047
01:46:25,284 --> 01:46:27,445
lsn't that right, Munna?
- Yes papa. But what about uncle?

1048
01:46:28,287 --> 01:46:30,187
After the guests have left we
shall go and visit your uncle.

1049
01:46:31,290 --> 01:46:32,314
What do you say?
- Yes Munna.

1050
01:46:33,559 --> 01:46:35,789
Yes papa. Don't forget to
get the latest comics..

1051
01:46:35,894 --> 01:46:37,191
..or l shan't speak with you.

1052
01:46:37,630 --> 01:46:39,530
Don't say these things today, Munna.

1053
01:46:40,833 --> 01:46:42,198
On this day you must
talk of good things.

1054
01:46:42,835 --> 01:46:45,326
l'll bring you lots of comics.
l'm leaving. Okay.

1055
01:47:42,494 --> 01:47:46,260
Let go off me, scoundrel. Let go
off me. l'll drink your blood.

1056
01:47:48,367 --> 01:47:54,533
First let me drink in your youth.
Then you may have my blood.

1057
01:47:55,574 --> 01:47:57,269
Don't you know l am lnspector
Arjun Singh's wife?

1058
01:47:57,910 --> 01:48:02,677
The woman whom l touch
becomes my wife.

1059
01:48:03,916 --> 01:48:06,282
l say, don't move forward.
- l shall.

1060
01:48:06,719 --> 01:48:07,743
l say, don't come forward.

1061
01:48:09,922 --> 01:48:13,414
Every woman that falls into
my arms yells just like you.

1062
01:48:14,393 --> 01:48:16,293
She suffers just like you.

1063
01:48:17,730 --> 01:48:22,963
And l enjoy her yelling
and her suffering.

1064
01:48:29,408 --> 01:48:31,308
Let me go. l say, let me go.

1065
01:48:32,945 --> 01:48:34,310
Scoundrel, let me go.

1066
01:48:34,747 --> 01:48:35,839
How can l let you go, my love.

1067
01:48:36,682 --> 01:48:38,309
Scoundrel, let me go. Let go off me.

1068
01:48:38,417 --> 01:48:39,441
Let go off me.

1069
01:48:42,621 --> 01:48:44,316
Let go off me. Scoundrel,
let go off me.

1070
01:48:57,436 --> 01:48:58,460
Where will you run off?

1071
01:49:02,040 --> 01:49:04,668
Leave my mother or l shall shoot.

1072
01:49:05,444 --> 01:49:08,345
Munna. Shoot him, son.
Shoot him, son.

1073
01:49:09,848 --> 01:49:12,339
lf you shoot l shall
kill your mother.

1074
01:49:13,986 --> 01:49:18,616
Munna, shoot. Munna shoot.
Shoot him, son.

1075
01:49:19,458 --> 01:49:20,482
Munna, shoot.

1076
01:49:23,662 --> 01:49:24,686
Let me go.

1077
01:49:28,600 --> 01:49:29,624
Let go off my son.

1078
01:49:44,483 --> 01:49:45,507
Munna!

1079
01:50:01,500 --> 01:50:02,524
Munna!

1080
01:50:07,039 --> 01:50:08,404
The rascal died.

1081
01:50:15,047 --> 01:50:16,071
Scoundrel!

1082
01:51:10,102 --> 01:51:12,468
Anita. Look, l've
brought you a sari.

1083
01:51:13,572 --> 01:51:15,870
Such a beautiful sari? l'll
wear this at Munna's wedding.

1084
01:51:16,909 --> 01:51:19,469
l'll get you a better sari than
this for Munna's wedding.

1085
01:51:27,586 --> 01:51:28,610
Papa, it says in the comic..

1086
01:51:28,720 --> 01:51:31,484
..applying kohl makes
the eyes sharper.

1087
01:51:32,591 --> 01:51:33,888
Will you read comics all day or
will you prepare to go to school?

1088
01:51:33,992 --> 01:51:35,084
Go on. Run.

1089
01:52:11,029 --> 01:52:14,521
What's happening? What is happening?

1090
01:52:38,924 --> 01:52:41,552
That's nothing. After that
from morning to evening..

1091
01:52:44,930 --> 01:52:46,693
What's the matter, brother?
You've come alone.

1092
01:52:47,666 --> 01:52:48,690
Today is Munna's birthday, isn't it?

1093
01:52:49,668 --> 01:52:51,568
Neither do you have cake nor
Munna and sister-in-law?

1094
01:52:56,875 --> 01:52:59,105
What's the matter?
Why are you silent?

1095
01:53:00,679 --> 01:53:01,839
Are Munna and sister-in-law
annoyed with me?

1096
01:53:02,948 --> 01:53:04,848
Silly, how is that possible?
Can your sister-in-law..

1097
01:53:04,950 --> 01:53:08,579
..and Munna ever get
annoyed with you?

1098
01:53:10,689 --> 01:53:11,713
Something has definitely happened?

1099
01:53:13,892 --> 01:53:17,589
Else you wouldn't have tears
on such a joyous day.

1100
01:53:17,696 --> 01:53:20,597
Thinking about how much
you love Munna..

1101
01:53:20,699 --> 01:53:24,863
..and your sister-in-law
brings tears to my eyes.

1102
01:53:24,970 --> 01:53:27,666
No brother, it's something else.

1103
01:53:28,640 --> 01:53:32,337
l'm feeling afraid, brother.
Take me to them.

1104
01:53:32,444 --> 01:53:37,609
No. No. Don't say that.
You can't go to them.

1105
01:53:37,716 --> 01:53:41,117
Why can't l go? Why can't l go?

1106
01:53:42,721 --> 01:53:44,882
You want to go leaving me alone.

1107
01:53:45,123 --> 01:53:47,648
You too want to go away like
them leaving me alone.

1108
01:53:49,194 --> 01:53:50,218
Brother!

1109
01:53:51,463 --> 01:53:53,624
Ajeet, your Munna and
your sister-in-law..

1110
01:53:53,732 --> 01:53:59,193
..have left both of us behind
in this world and departed.

1111
01:53:59,671 --> 01:54:01,764
They departed leaving both
of us by ourselves.

1112
01:54:02,340 --> 01:54:09,644
No brother. This is impossible.
This is impossible.

1113
01:54:09,748 --> 01:54:15,345
Hey silly, l lit their pyres and
l'm standing here in front of you.

1114
01:54:16,688 --> 01:54:21,648
Brother, l won't stay here.
l won't stay here.

1115
01:54:22,761 --> 01:54:25,662
Have you gone mad? lf your
stitches come undone..

1116
01:54:25,764 --> 01:54:27,857
..several things could go wrong.

1117
01:54:27,966 --> 01:54:31,663
Hey brother, when the stitches
of life are broken..

1118
01:54:31,770 --> 01:54:34,170
..what's the point of taking care
of these stitches, brother.?

1119
01:54:36,041 --> 01:54:39,738
Ajeet! Ajeet!

1120
01:55:23,021 --> 01:55:24,249
Did you unearth anything?

1121
01:55:36,268 --> 01:55:41,035
Brother, do you think sister-in-law
isn't watching your condition?

1122
01:55:42,174 --> 01:55:43,732
Won't Munna's soul be uneasy..

1123
01:55:43,842 --> 01:55:46,743
..on seeing that his father's
is hungry since three days?

1124
01:55:49,781 --> 01:55:54,878
The one who destroyed our joys
and our lives is still alive.

1125
01:55:55,787 --> 01:55:58,756
To finish him off it is important
that we remain alive.

1126
01:56:00,025 --> 01:56:01,822
Eat your food, brother.

1127
01:56:11,803 --> 01:56:13,771
Brother, even he hasn't
eaten anything.

1128
01:56:27,085 --> 01:56:32,921
God, my brother is in this
condition. l never complained.

1129
01:56:34,125 --> 01:56:38,789
With these very hands l lit..

1130
01:56:38,897 --> 01:56:43,800
..the pyres of my wife and son.

1131
01:56:44,169 --> 01:56:46,899
lf you want my life as
well, then kill me.

1132
01:56:48,873 --> 01:56:51,239
Only give me a little
more time, God.

1133
01:56:51,977 --> 01:56:54,411
l am burning up in the
flames of vengeance.

1134
01:56:55,914 --> 01:57:00,248
God, let me confront that
monster just once.

1135
01:57:01,253 --> 01:57:06,418
And give me enough strength to
wipe his name of this earth.

1136
01:57:06,524 --> 01:57:09,357
Let me finish him, God.
Give me strength.

1137
01:57:09,928 --> 01:57:12,988
Give me strength, Lord.
Give me strength.

1138
01:57:14,966 --> 01:57:16,831
When my own people don't
know who l am..

1139
01:57:16,935 --> 01:57:19,130
..how will Arjun Singh
know who l am?

1140
01:57:19,337 --> 01:57:20,827
You are right, boss.

1141
01:57:20,939 --> 01:57:28,004
Anyway, the girl that escaped,
when can l bed her?

1142
01:57:28,213 --> 01:57:30,841
Boss, that girl is in
Arjun Singh's custody..

1143
01:57:30,949 --> 01:57:33,383
..and she lives in his house.

1144
01:57:34,219 --> 01:57:38,315
This means our men are afraid
of Arjun Singh and the cops.

1145
01:57:38,890 --> 01:57:41,051
l want that girl within
twenty-four hours.

1146
01:57:41,159 --> 01:57:45,858
l know of a man through whom
we can get the job done..

1147
01:57:45,964 --> 01:57:50,025
..without any repercussions.

1148
01:57:50,902 --> 01:57:53,462
l don't understand what
you're saying, Mr. Sinha.

1149
01:57:53,905 --> 01:57:57,534
What's there to understand?
l have explained to you..

1150
01:57:57,642 --> 01:58:00,975
..several times that the key to
your sister's death is with Preeti.

1151
01:58:01,079 --> 01:58:03,240
Bring her to the address
l gave you..

1152
01:58:03,348 --> 01:58:06,340
..and there you'll have your
evidence and your lost love too.

1153
01:58:06,918 --> 01:58:09,182
But could this be a con
job on your behalf?

1154
01:58:09,387 --> 01:58:13,016
What is the con? You too
will accompany Preeti.

1155
01:58:13,258 --> 01:58:16,591
Don't you believe in
your own strength?

1156
01:58:19,497 --> 01:58:21,397
All right, Mr. Sinha.

1157
01:58:22,267 --> 01:58:26,897
Mr. Sinha, l'll bring Preeti
to the address you gave me..

1158
01:58:27,005 --> 01:58:30,907
..somehow or the other. But
remember when l get there..

1159
01:58:31,009 --> 01:58:35,207
..if you don't give me the evidence
of my sister's murder..

1160
01:58:35,313 --> 01:58:37,543
..or if your intentions
are improper..

1161
01:58:37,649 --> 01:58:40,209
..l shall beat you
up so mercilessly..

1162
01:58:40,318 --> 01:58:44,277
..your family won't recognize
your dead body.

1163
01:58:44,389 --> 01:58:48,416
Now that's more like
a man. Take this.

1164
01:58:51,996 --> 01:58:55,955
Ring?! - An individual named
Richa shall be with you.

1165
01:58:56,067 --> 01:59:00,163
He is a slave to this ring. He has
the strength of an elephant..

1166
01:59:00,271 --> 01:59:02,535
..but his brain is smaller
than an ant's.

1167
01:59:02,640 --> 01:59:05,939
But why would l need
Richa's assistance?

1168
01:59:06,044 --> 01:59:07,534
You never know.

1169
01:59:11,783 --> 01:59:15,048
l'm sorry Hemant. Without
Arjun Singh's permission..

1170
01:59:15,153 --> 01:59:17,519
..l cannot take a step
out of this house.

1171
01:59:19,124 --> 01:59:21,957
This means even you don't
want me to find out..

1172
01:59:22,060 --> 01:59:24,961
..the mystery surrounding
my sister's death.

1173
01:59:25,063 --> 01:59:27,964
That's not true Hemant. You
are simply misconstruing..

1174
01:59:28,066 --> 01:59:30,967
..that Ajeet is your
sister's murderer.

1175
01:59:31,069 --> 01:59:34,971
No matter what, Preeti,
you should accompany me.

1176
01:59:35,073 --> 01:59:39,510
l told you l couldn't leave the
house without Arjun's permission.

1177
01:59:39,611 --> 01:59:45,481
What's the matter, Hemant? Preeti,
where are you going?

1178
01:59:48,019 --> 01:59:51,614
l am taking Preeti with me. l'll
bring her back in a short while.

1179
01:59:51,723 --> 01:59:56,717
Preeti won't go with you. Preeti,
go upstairs. Go upstairs.

1180
01:59:59,097 --> 02:00:04,296
Preeti will go with me. lf you
don't permit her to go..

1181
02:00:04,402 --> 02:00:06,996
..l shall take her against her will.

1182
02:01:35,126 --> 02:01:36,616
Richa, come quick.

1183
02:01:38,663 --> 02:01:41,564
Have faith in me. Nothing
will happen to you.

1184
02:02:08,860 --> 02:02:11,488
Hemant.
- Don't be afraid. Come.

1185
02:02:16,267 --> 02:02:19,395
Welcome. Welcome, Mr.
Hemant. Welcome.

1186
02:02:19,604 --> 02:02:21,834
We were awaiting you.

1187
02:02:21,940 --> 02:02:25,137
Well, l've fulfilled my promise.

1188
02:02:25,243 --> 02:02:27,837
Now tell me who is my
sister's assassin.

1189
02:02:28,046 --> 02:02:30,879
You'll know right now who
is your sister's assassin.

1190
02:02:30,982 --> 02:02:32,006
Hood man.

1191
02:02:34,686 --> 02:02:38,087
l see. So this is my
sister's assassin.

1192
02:02:38,189 --> 02:02:41,852
Not me. But your sister's
assassin is one of my men.

1193
02:02:41,960 --> 02:02:43,860
His name is Tej Singh.

1194
02:02:43,962 --> 02:02:47,261
Where is that scoundrel?
l shall kill him.

1195
02:02:47,365 --> 02:02:52,598
Be patient! Be patient! l
couldn't have your sister.

1196
02:02:52,904 --> 02:02:57,238
But today l will certainly have her.

1197
02:02:57,342 --> 02:02:59,867
Don't be afraid, Preeti.
As long as l am here..

1198
02:02:59,978 --> 02:03:03,209
..nothing will happen to you.
-Only time will tell.

1199
02:03:03,314 --> 02:03:05,942
Hemant. - Go and take her
to my room downstairs.

1200
02:03:06,918 --> 02:03:10,581
Bathe her and dress her
up and present her to me.

1201
02:03:10,688 --> 02:03:12,952
Hemant.
- Bastard, l'll kill you.

1202
02:03:13,057 --> 02:03:14,285
No! Hemant!

1203
02:03:14,392 --> 02:03:17,190
Tie her up. - Hemant, save me.
- So she can't escape.

1204
02:03:17,929 --> 02:03:21,228
Let go. Let go off me. Help.

1205
02:03:21,933 --> 02:03:25,926
Brother. What happened, brother?

1206
02:03:28,539 --> 02:03:33,101
A bear like man threatened
me and abducted Preeti.

1207
02:03:33,211 --> 02:03:34,371
Preeti. Where?

1208
02:03:38,049 --> 02:03:40,916
Look, Tommy is hinting at something.

1209
02:03:48,226 --> 02:03:49,454
Leave me!

1210
02:04:01,773 --> 02:04:02,933
You may go.

1211
02:04:09,380 --> 02:04:13,942
You made me wait a long time.
You wouldn't get trapped.

1212
02:04:14,152 --> 02:04:16,450
No. Don't come forward.

1213
02:04:16,988 --> 02:04:23,359
lf l don't come forward, how
will we consummate today?

1214
02:04:23,628 --> 02:04:26,563
l'm telling you for the last time,
don't come close to me.

1215
02:04:34,806 --> 02:04:39,209
Let go! Let go! Let
go off me! Let go!

1216
02:04:40,211 --> 02:04:42,702
Scoundrel, let me go.

1217
02:04:45,016 --> 02:04:46,313
That sounds like Preeti yelling.

1218
02:04:46,417 --> 02:04:48,248
Go and look for Preeti and
l'll handle these people.

1219
02:04:56,027 --> 02:04:57,358
Let go!

1220
02:05:01,165 --> 02:05:02,189
Ajeet!

1221
02:05:04,435 --> 02:05:07,029
Who are you?
- Your father.

1222
02:05:24,122 --> 02:05:26,056
He'll kill me!

1223
02:05:51,549 --> 02:05:53,039
So these scoundrels trapped
you, didn't they?

1224
02:05:53,151 --> 02:05:55,142
Forgive me, brother.
l made a mistake.

1225
02:05:55,253 --> 02:05:56,777
Where is Preeti?
- Hood man took her downstairs.

1226
02:06:07,165 --> 02:06:08,655
No! Ajeet!

1227
02:06:47,471 --> 02:06:50,099
Ajeet, finish this scoundrel.

1228
02:07:20,638 --> 02:07:22,731
Stop Richa. l said stop!

1229
02:07:30,181 --> 02:07:33,150
Richa, finish all of them.

1230
02:07:33,317 --> 02:07:34,750
Dog!

1231
02:08:04,215 --> 02:08:05,239
Ajeet!

1232
02:08:08,719 --> 02:08:11,483
C'mon.
- Let go off me! Let go!

1233
02:08:21,565 --> 02:08:22,589
Let go off me!

1234
02:08:26,570 --> 02:08:30,199
Stop! Stop Richa too!

1235
02:08:30,308 --> 02:08:34,574
Richa! Stop! l say stop, Richa!

1236
02:08:37,048 --> 02:08:38,811
And return my ring to me.

1237
02:08:40,651 --> 02:08:43,211
Hurry up or l shall shoot.

1238
02:09:00,338 --> 02:09:02,397
Richa, finish both of them.

1239
02:10:10,341 --> 02:10:14,835
Today l want to see the face of
the devil hidden behind the mask.

1240
02:10:16,447 --> 02:10:18,312
That you can never see.

1241
02:10:20,684 --> 02:10:22,709
Very good, Tej Singh. Very good.

1242
02:10:22,820 --> 02:10:24,048
Tej Singh!

1243
02:10:24,355 --> 02:10:27,552
Arjun Singh, you could
never see my face.

1244
02:10:27,658 --> 02:10:30,889
But today l wish to show you
my face on my own accord..

1245
02:10:30,995 --> 02:10:34,431
..so this wish of yours can
be fulfilled before you die.

1246
02:10:36,367 --> 02:10:37,391
Look!

1247
02:10:39,937 --> 02:10:42,337
Sir Laxmichand! You!

1248
02:10:42,440 --> 02:10:43,498
Yes! Me!

1249
02:10:44,375 --> 02:10:47,867
Shame on you!

1250
02:10:47,978 --> 02:10:51,914
You molested your own daughter
and had her killed.

1251
02:10:52,016 --> 02:10:54,416
Whose daughter? Which daughter?

1252
02:10:54,518 --> 02:10:57,351
These are my partner's children..

1253
02:10:57,455 --> 02:11:00,549
..whom l killed and made
away with his wealth.

1254
02:11:01,392 --> 02:11:06,091
Scoundrel! This means you killed
my father and my sister.

1255
02:12:09,093 --> 02:12:13,154
Bastard! Dog!

1256
02:12:14,965 --> 02:12:20,062
You killed my sister, scoundrel.
l won't let you live.

1257
02:12:20,171 --> 02:12:21,661
No!

1258
02:12:39,089 --> 02:12:42,889
Brother, he still has strength
left in him. How will he die?

1259
02:12:45,496 --> 02:12:50,866
How does Mr. Bear die
in your comic? Tell me.

1260
02:12:50,968 --> 02:12:54,961
By attacking him in his eyes.
His life is in his eyes.

1261
02:12:55,072 --> 02:12:56,539
lndeed!

1262
02:12:58,642 --> 02:13:00,132
Let go off me!

1263
02:13:22,866 --> 02:13:24,595
Ajeet, don't let him go scot-free.

1264
02:13:29,273 --> 02:13:30,968
Hemant, give me the spear.

1265
02:13:38,916 --> 02:13:40,144
Brother.

1266
02:13:44,555 --> 02:13:46,955
No! Ajeet!

1267
02:14:32,336 --> 02:14:39,674
Hemant! Hemant! Hemant!

1268
02:14:40,778 --> 02:14:46,978
Preeti, bringing you here was a
great mistake on my part. - No!

1269
02:14:47,618 --> 02:14:54,786
Hemant! - lf possible. lf
possible please forgive me.

1270
02:15:00,631 --> 02:15:02,326
No! Hemant!

1271
02:15:18,649 --> 02:15:24,178
Hit me. Hit me more. Smash
these bones to smithereens.

1272
02:15:24,288 --> 02:15:28,622
My lust has led me to
many sins. Hit me!

1273
02:15:33,664 --> 02:15:34,722
Hemant!

1274
02:15:46,076 --> 02:15:47,134
Brother!

1275
02:16:29,052 --> 02:16:30,110
No!

1276
02:16:32,222 --> 02:16:33,280
Brother!

1277
02:16:33,791 --> 02:16:35,224
O my God!

1278
02:16:47,871 --> 02:16:49,771
Brother!
