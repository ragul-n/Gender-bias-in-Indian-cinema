1
00:00:44,344 --> 00:00:48,280
''Listen to me for a minute, Begum
Please come here.''

2
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:52,375
What is this? - This is your
gift for ld.

3
00:00:56,322 --> 00:00:59,485
By God! You are looking like
a new bride.

4
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:06,432
''Let it be -Let it be, Mother. As
l was not born l could not see...''

5
00:01:06,499 --> 00:01:10,401
...you in the form of a bride.
Let me have a look at you now.

6
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:15,340
Why are you raising your hand
on my nephew?. He is right.

7
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,473
''You are really looking very
beautiful, my sister.''

8
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:31,321
Now my son has got all the
beauty of my wife.

9
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:36,326
He has got my colour
only in his sole.

10
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:47,473
A black mark in the feet is
always auspicious.

11
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:50,499
Huh! That's why he is making
me roam everywhere.

12
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:58,382
You still remember this day?
- How can l forget this day?

13
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:00,442
''Are you in Bombay these
days, brother Maruti?''

14
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:04,446
''l have great power in Bombay.
Until l reach, train doesn't leave''

15
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:14,265
lt's time for my office.
- l'll also go with you

16
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:23,500
Let us leave too. - So early?

17
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:27,405
She has to leave for Kolhapur &
l have to go to Bombay-Let's go

18
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:45,297
Congratulations for coming out
of jail after 10 years.

19
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:50,302
Where is the other garland?
- Which garland?

20
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:53,396
The same one which l wanted to
give to Salma as my wife

21
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:58,467
What happened? - lt's late Sir

22
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:03,338
Salma got married after you
went to jail.

23
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:12,323
That's never possible. l have
never learnt to be refused.

24
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:23,335
''Jafar, you? - So you thought that
l'll never come back & marry...''

25
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:28,363
...your daughter to somebody
else-Your reality was revealed...

26
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:32,435
...while you were sent for jail.
You've murdered lots of people.

27
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:35,276
And confiscated lakhs of rupees.

28
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:37,306
l was collecting the money for
your daughter only

29
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:44,483
But you married her off to a
Fakir. Get her divorced now

30
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:56,428
''l can hand over my daughter to
death, but at no cost to you.''

31
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:05,310
Alright then. l'll kill your
son-in-law & take Salma.

32
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,347
''No, l won't allow you to do this.
- Don't come in my way''

33
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:20,322
Atleast fear God -l'm my own
God. l need not fear anyone.

34
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:09,434
''Allarakha, you are with me for
years. Now the fate of our...''

35
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:17,439
...family is in your hands. Go &
give this letter to Salma.

36
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,368
Why have you come here?

37
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:50,314
''l have come here to take you, as
my marriage was fixed with you...''

38
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,513
''...10 years ago-Shameless, don't
you know that l'm married?''

39
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:58,348
l don't have any value for any
rituals. People know that...

40
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:01,383
''...l take whatever l want,
even by using force.''

41
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:04,362
Because stubbornness is plying
in Jafar's blood.

42
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:14,331
How many doors will you close
for me-Have some fear for God

43
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:19,469
''l don't fear God or his
punishment. lnstead, l give...''

44
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:22,379
''...punishment to people, who
don't listen to me.''

45
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:35,460
''Beware! lf you come forward, l'll
put this flame on you''

46
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:39,354
Don't be a fool. Have a look at
the hut & your condition.

47
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,391
''Come with me, l'll keep you
immersed in wealth''

48
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:47,463
The husband is the most precious
jewellery for an lndian wife.

49
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:53,371
And the dress given by him is
superior to the costliest dresses

50
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:59,351
l can throw the dust of my
husband's feet to your wealth

51
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:06,348
What if l kill your husband?
- Then there will be two burials

52
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:09,418
One will be him and the other
mine. Go away from here

53
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:15,264
Otherwise l'll call out everybody
& they will beat you up.

54
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:23,239
''Alright then. Although l'm leaving
now, l'll leave this city...''

55
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:25,402
...only when Salma will
be with me.

56
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:38,389
''What is it, Allarakha?''

57
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:58,494
Father!

58
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:55,258
Allah!
- Mother!

59
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:31,330
Please don't take her.

60
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:28,285
Why have you stopped the cart?
- How can l go in this flood?

61
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:39,355
''Take this 20 rupees & let it go,
else her bus will leave.''

62
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:28,313
My son!

63
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:55,270
l have become an orphan. l don't
have anyone in this world now.

64
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:07,282
''Despite your presence, l have
lost my parents, Allah''

65
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:16,454
Uncle! - l have also lost
everyone.

66
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,421
Now you are only everything for
me. l'll take care of you.

67
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:26,429
This accident has caused her a
great shock. She has lost...

68
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:31,273
...the ability to speak. Did she
have a son? - Yes

69
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,336
His presence is very essential
now. Otherwise we can't...

70
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:36,472
...give her any treatment.
- But where will l find him?

71
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:40,315
''l'm sorry. lf you care for her
life, then bring the child.''

72
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:46,518
What is there to worry so
much? We will find a child.

73
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:54,296
Hot news for today. America has
built the hydrogen bomb.

74
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:07,369
''Uncle, are you going to
Ajmer Sharif -No, my son''

75
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:17,412
''Paper please -Sir, are you going
to Ajmer Sharif? - No''

76
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:22,494
Please have a seat in the bogie.
l'll come with the change.

77
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:30,325
''Bob, l have opened an office
for you here also.''

78
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:34,328
''But be careful, my name should
not appear in any context.''

79
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:44,414
Sir! Sir!

80
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:54,487
''Madam, if you are going to
Ajmer Sharif, please offer...''

81
00:14:54,526 --> 00:15:00,328
...100 rupees to Lord on my
behalf and pray so that...

82
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:01,492
''...l get back my mother,
whom l have lost.''

83
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:07,428
Mother! Where did you go away?

84
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:12,274
She is my mother. - Get
away from here

85
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:18,380
''Nurse, bring the child.''

86
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:29,350
What's the matter? - Good that
Salma lost her memory

87
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:32,262
Otherwise her real son would
have taken her away today

88
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:33,423
Should l finish him
- Kill him

89
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:58,423
''Mother, please don't go away.
Don't leave your son like this.''

90
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,465
''Why don't you speak, mother?''

91
00:17:57,342 --> 00:17:59,367
''Don't be worried, Uncle. From
today, l will serve as your...''

92
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:02,278
...right hand and carry the load
of the world together.

93
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:09,378
''Allarakha, from today, it's
the responsibility of both of us...''

94
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:11,286
...to protect the porters.

95
00:18:58,403 --> 00:18:59,392
Walk fast

96
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:07,412
You dropped my dog.

97
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,258
''Sir, why did you beat that
porter (coolie)?''

98
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:27,423
His mouth is bleeding.

99
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:45,316
''Don't come forward, else you'll
have to face the consequences''

100
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:48,410
l am a member of the Railway
Advisory Board.

101
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:55,256
''He has beaten our man -Halt,
otherwise, l'll kill you all.''

102
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:14,434
''What's the matter, Allarakha?''

103
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:21,286
ls it so? Let's see

104
00:20:56,321 --> 00:21:03,386
Who are you?
- First open your window.

105
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:08,297
My introduction is lengthy. l
always have Allah's blessings...

106
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,426
''...on me from childhood, and
Allarakha is with me.''

107
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:15,439
''My label is 786, l work as
a coolie and my name is...''

108
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:17,339
lqbal

109
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,472
What do you want? - The labour
should get his fees before...

110
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:33,322
...his sweat dries up. lt'll be
good if you ask for forgivance

111
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:43,460
No? Think well. lf the load that
a porter carries is put on your...

112
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:47,302
''...head, you will go under
the earth.''

113
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,299
lt seems you will leave after
being beten up.

114
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:58,305
''l'm not going to leave, as this is
our home. You are only the guest''

115
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:02,309
So the residents will feed you
and you will eat.

116
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:10,486
''Now see the fun, Allarakha.''

117
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:22,390
''Arrest him -Arrest the other,
Sir -No''

118
00:23:27,472 --> 00:23:30,441
''What have l done, Sir?
- You have created all the chaos''

119
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:33,307
Me? l'll see.

120
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:46,288
''Sir, we don't create the chaos.
There will be chaos...''

121
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:50,283
...if we are not here. l'll
show you how.

122
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:09,309
STRlKE!!

123
00:26:40,298 --> 00:26:44,428
''Why have you stopped the train?
- To make you listen to us, Sir''

124
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:49,372
Meaning? - The son of Railway
chairman hit a porter badly.

125
00:26:49,407 --> 00:26:52,376
''And when a fight followed,
police arrested our...''

126
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:59,339
...leader lqbal. -
OK. P.A. - Yes Sir

127
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:01,409
Call for a railway board meeting.
And their leader should also...

128
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:05,253
''...take part in the meeting
- Ok, Sir''

129
00:27:05,323 --> 00:27:07,348
We will investigate the
matter fully

130
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,292
''How will you investigate, when
your board member raises...''

131
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:10,453
...his hands on one of
the porters.

132
00:27:10,495 --> 00:27:16,229
Please have some time to look
at how poor men live someday

133
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,292
How we live by drinking tears
instead of water?

134
00:27:18,336 --> 00:27:23,467
There is noone to listen to them
as they are treated like dogs.

135
00:27:23,508 --> 00:27:28,343
''But there is no bandage,
medicine, hospital or...''

136
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,473
...providend fund for us. We
carry the load of the world.

137
00:27:30,515 --> 00:27:35,384
But is there someone who will
carry our burdens?

138
00:27:41,292 --> 00:27:44,386
''After listening to both of you,
we have come to the conclusion...''

139
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:47,262
...that the fault was Mr. Puri's.
Ask him to ask for forgivance.

140
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:50,267
You want me to ask for
forgivance from him. Never!

141
00:27:50,301 --> 00:27:51,495
''OK, then submit your resignation.''

142
00:27:57,475 --> 00:28:02,276
''Sir, he is a heart patient. - Huh,
when he doesn't have a heart...''

143
00:28:02,313 --> 00:28:05,282
...how can he have a heart
disease? l think it is...

144
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:08,376
...fits. Make him smell some
leather -Shut up!

145
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:10,443
Have you all seen the drama?

146
00:28:15,393 --> 00:28:18,362
lt's better to resign then to ask
for excuse from him

147
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:26,368
''Mr. Puri has resigned. Now put
an end to your strike -OK, Sir''

148
00:29:13,485 --> 00:29:17,251
We carry the load of the world

149
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:36,304
People come & go

150
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:40,435
But we stay back here

151
00:30:23,421 --> 00:30:27,482
''ldiot -Not idiot, my name is
lqbal. lt seems the angels...''

152
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:31,292
...have taken one month off to
make you as per Allah's order.

153
00:30:31,362 --> 00:30:38,461
''Rascal, you spoilt my dress
- But your face became beautiful.''

154
00:30:49,447 --> 00:30:53,281
''This is the joy of four men,
but pay for just one''

155
00:30:58,456 --> 00:31:01,482
Don't soak the poor's blood
Please pay the fare

156
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:06,486
''By God, one rupee is very less''

157
00:31:07,298 --> 00:31:11,428
We earn our bread the hard way.

158
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:55,437
Drank some water and
remembered the God

159
00:31:55,480 --> 00:32:01,248
''Our hunger & thirst,
both are satisfied this way''

160
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:14,320
''We work every day, and only
scarcely get praised.''

161
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:06,314
lt's very hard to live.
We also have a heart in us.

162
00:33:06,351 --> 00:33:14,315
''And there are expectations in the
heart, as we are also human.''

163
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:38,372
''When we are grief-stricken,
we go to celebrate''

164
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:48,451
We lit Beedi and
have Betal leaves

165
00:35:06,304 --> 00:35:09,398
''See mother, this is my last
job-application. lf l don't get...''

166
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:13,433
''...a job in the newspaper office,
l'll start selling newspapers.''

167
00:35:13,511 --> 00:35:17,311
Mr. Lyenger is calling you

168
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:22,317
l got the job. Please take
care of my luggage.

169
00:35:47,378 --> 00:35:49,346
l have completed my journalism
course in London

170
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,473
And l am also the son of a
very wealthy person.

171
00:35:54,285 --> 00:35:57,413
''lf my father wants, he can buy
such small presses any time.''

172
00:35:57,455 --> 00:36:06,261
''Then buy this. - No, l want to
stand on my own foot.''

173
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:12,361
''Where are you standing now?.
See, although we publish the...''

174
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:23,279
''...newspaper, they don't have
much readers. Bring such news...''

175
00:36:23,314 --> 00:36:28,411
...for our front page that all
the papers are sold...

176
00:36:28,452 --> 00:36:31,444
...even before being published.
- l'll do that.

177
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:47,430
''Savitri, tomorrow they are
coming to see daughter Deepa.''

178
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:55,344
So l have brought a Saree.
- But will she wear it?

179
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:44,292
''You'll get some news, but give
me the commission first''

180
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:53,429
Speak in Hindi -A lady gave
birth to 7 children yesterday.

181
00:37:57,508 --> 00:37:59,442
''The eighth one is expected,
please call the doctor.''

182
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:48,349
''This is our daughter, Deepa''

183
00:38:58,302 --> 00:39:01,271
''Please arrange for their
marriage, l'll publish their...''

184
00:39:01,305 --> 00:39:04,274
...photograph on the front page
of my newspaper

185
00:39:12,383 --> 00:39:16,444
Don't be shocked. l'll not take
any charge for that.

186
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:26,456
ls she your daughter?
- Then is it my neighbour's?

187
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:31,264
And whose children are
these seven?

188
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:38,274
''The girl is mine, but not the
other seven children.''

189
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,377
''Deepa, why are you crying?
- Why didn't you tell me...''

190
00:40:13,377 --> 00:40:16,346
...earlier that you are
leaving this school?

191
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:19,474
We are going to London for
my mother's treatment

192
00:40:20,284 --> 00:40:22,275
And Daddy told me that we
will stay there itself.

193
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:24,412
My parents also wanted to send
me to a different school...

194
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:29,358
...but l didn't go because of you.
And now you are going to London

195
00:40:29,393 --> 00:40:34,456
l'll come back after completion
of my studies. Do write to me.

196
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:44,464
''You keep my photograph, and
l'll keep yours.''

197
00:40:58,489 --> 00:41:05,395
Why did you leave me? l was
not able to forget you.

198
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:19,402
''l knew that you will be mad
with happiness, and it happened''

199
00:41:19,443 --> 00:41:23,470
''You know, l did the composing &
printing for this front page...''

200
00:41:23,514 --> 00:41:30,352
...myself the entire night. l didn't
even shave & eat anything.

201
00:41:32,356 --> 00:41:36,349
You haven't eaten food -Yes
- Will you eat? - Sure

202
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:47,304
Are all the papers sold out
- Some are left

203
00:41:50,307 --> 00:41:53,401
Whose photo did you publish in
the paper? - That girl's...

204
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:57,278
And the father's
- l couldn't find him

205
00:41:57,314 --> 00:42:00,374
Then publish my photograph.
l am her father.

206
00:42:00,451 --> 00:42:04,444
So you are the grandfather of
seven children. Congratulations!

207
00:42:06,423 --> 00:42:15,297
That girl is unmarried. You ruined
her life. Now eat this paper.

208
00:42:19,403 --> 00:42:26,332
How will l eat that? - Put some
spice -& this curry

209
00:42:26,343 --> 00:42:30,279
Let me wash my hands first.
- Eat now

210
00:43:08,485 --> 00:43:10,476
''Bhima, kick him out of the room.''

211
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:28,269
''Lqbal, see the moon of
ld has appeared.''

212
00:43:45,522 --> 00:43:48,320
''Congratulations on ld-moon,
mother''

213
00:43:48,392 --> 00:43:52,522
People say that one should see
an auspicious face after...

214
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:56,460
...seeing the ld-moon &.
Then his wishes are fulfilled.

215
00:43:56,500 --> 00:44:04,339
''For me, you are the most
auspicious after God''

216
00:44:10,347 --> 00:44:14,443
''Although l see your face, you
haven't fulfilled any of my wish''

217
00:44:17,421 --> 00:44:24,293
''Mothers take great care of their
children, but you you never...''

218
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:29,356
...even come to bless me
for a long life.

219
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:49,384
''Still, may Lord keep you always
happy, wherever you are.''

220
00:45:13,277 --> 00:45:16,474
When did you give her the shock
last time -Almost 15 days ago

221
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:22,477
''Bastard, didn't l ask you give
her shock every day?''

222
00:45:23,287 --> 00:45:26,415
''lf she gets back her memory,
then l'll kill you all.''

223
00:45:26,457 --> 00:45:29,449
l want her to lose her
memory fo ever

224
00:45:31,295 --> 00:45:34,389
''From the time, you have brought
her, she is like a dead body.''

225
00:45:34,465 --> 00:45:41,428
''She is of no use. Why
don't you kill her, sir?''

226
00:45:41,472 --> 00:45:48,378
No. She is the sign of my
victory. l have kept her as...

227
00:45:48,378 --> 00:45:52,474
''...decoration in my house, as
people keep their hunts.''

228
00:45:52,516 --> 00:45:54,416
This is her punishment.

229
00:46:10,334 --> 00:46:13,360
The doctors have said that you
should not think much.

230
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:18,331
And there is your letter from
your son from lndia.

231
00:46:20,477 --> 00:46:23,310
He has written that he will get
a job in a newspaper office

232
00:46:23,347 --> 00:46:27,249
And has also written that he
has left drinking for ever.

233
00:46:41,331 --> 00:46:46,359
l don't have any addiction
for drinking

234
00:46:46,403 --> 00:46:49,372
l only drink to forget
my sorrows

235
00:47:03,387 --> 00:47:06,379
To remove your memories

236
00:47:12,396 --> 00:47:17,265
''And l drink
to forget my sorrows,''

237
00:47:18,368 --> 00:47:22,361
l don't have addiction to drink

238
00:47:22,406 --> 00:47:26,399
l only drink to forget
my sorrows

239
00:47:35,419 --> 00:47:38,354
And to forget your friendship

240
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:56,390
This book is about my heart

241
00:48:56,433 --> 00:49:01,393
And the story of my heart

242
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:17,352
l have one part with me

243
00:49:17,354 --> 00:49:22,314
And the other part with you.

244
00:49:24,361 --> 00:49:28,229
How will l complete the
story now?.

245
00:50:09,373 --> 00:50:13,332
lf we meet her now

246
00:50:13,377 --> 00:50:18,405
lt'll cause even water
to catch fire

247
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:34,453
The same friendship
of the childhood

248
00:50:34,498 --> 00:50:39,333
Would have started again
in this youth?

249
00:50:41,505 --> 00:50:47,466
l would have changed this
friendship to love

250
00:51:29,453 --> 00:51:31,318
My high feeling is gone after
seeing the police

251
00:51:36,359 --> 00:51:38,384
''See, police is after me. Please
hide me somewhere.''

252
00:51:40,397 --> 00:51:43,298
Your father expelled me from the
job yesterday because of you

253
00:51:43,333 --> 00:51:46,393
''And if police come to know of
this, they will put me in jail''

254
00:51:49,339 --> 00:51:52,308
You lost your job because of me
only! Then look at this

255
00:51:58,348 --> 00:52:01,408
''Send me home, you'll have 5,000
rupees. Half yours & half mine''

256
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:06,320
Then l'll run away again. Then
again that 'half yours' deal

257
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:17,457
Take your reward. - You caught
me. l'll see you!

258
00:52:29,446 --> 00:52:37,444
''This lyenger family's girl is
missing, her height is 5 feet''

259
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:42,382
She is dark complexioned
And her name is Deepa

260
00:52:46,429 --> 00:52:49,421
Why are you delaying? - Haven't
you read in the papers?

261
00:52:49,466 --> 00:52:52,458
''lf some Tamilian catches you this
time, he will get special reward.''

262
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:57,371
''Although it's easy to become a
Gujrati, Punjabi or so,''

263
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,431
...it takes time
to become a Tamilian

264
00:53:35,412 --> 00:53:37,346
Hi Lamboo
- Hello Tingu

265
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:40,440
Where are you taking her?
- To take the reward from...

266
00:53:40,450 --> 00:53:43,476
''...her father. - But l am supposed
to take her, as l called him up''

267
00:53:45,388 --> 00:53:48,289
Then tell him now that this
Lamboo will take her this time

268
00:53:54,464 --> 00:53:58,400
''Lambooji -Yes, Tinguji''

269
00:54:05,275 --> 00:54:07,505
Don't come in my way

270
00:54:13,483 --> 00:54:17,476
Don't touch this girl

271
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:25,451
''Tinguji -Yes, Lambooji''

272
00:54:32,369 --> 00:54:35,338
Don't come in my way

273
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:44,402
Don't touch this girl

274
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:31,426
l have seen her before you

275
00:55:31,461 --> 00:55:35,488
But l searched for her
earlier than you

276
00:55:46,443 --> 00:55:50,402
She is taking my name

277
00:55:50,447 --> 00:55:54,315
But she is my reward

278
00:56:03,426 --> 00:56:06,395
Don't wake up my anger by
touching the girl

279
00:57:01,384 --> 00:57:04,410
l have come from Madras
to Bombay

280
00:57:04,454 --> 00:57:09,323
And how tall you have become
on the way itself

281
00:57:14,464 --> 00:57:17,433
There is no tall or short
in this game

282
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:26,359
l have brought her back

283
00:58:26,402 --> 00:58:30,361
This will be decided
by her father

284
00:58:41,384 --> 00:58:43,443
Make this deal equal

285
00:58:43,486 --> 00:58:48,253
You mean both our
calculations should be equal

286
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:53,520
Our special reward -This girl
always runs away from home.

287
00:58:54,297 --> 00:58:57,494
And after finding her back
we became bankrupt in...

288
00:58:58,268 --> 00:59:01,294
...giving rewards. - So marry her.
This is the special reward.

289
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:06,501
''Lambooji -Yes, Tinguji''

290
00:59:07,277 --> 00:59:11,304
This girl is not a treasure

291
00:59:53,489 --> 00:59:55,423
ls Mr. Chopra there?

292
00:59:55,458 --> 00:59:59,417
He doesn't come here anymore.
The owner is different now.

293
00:59:59,462 --> 01:00:05,264
''But he had promised to give
rooms to us today -OK, go''

294
01:00:18,247 --> 01:00:19,509
You? -How come you are here?

295
01:00:19,549 --> 01:00:25,385
We have our small rooms in the
place you have in your front.

296
01:00:25,421 --> 01:00:28,515
Please take the rest of the
money and give us the rooms

297
01:00:29,258 --> 01:00:32,421
''Did you pay any money earlier
- Yes, this is the reciept.''

298
01:00:35,498 --> 01:00:38,524
''And the rest of the amount?
- Here are 4,000 rupees''

299
01:00:42,271 --> 01:00:43,431
How can you a get rooms
in that rate?

300
01:00:50,246 --> 01:00:52,407
''Where are the contracts, Vicky?
Read it to him''

301
01:00:55,351 --> 01:00:59,378
''1,000 rupees advance & before
taking the room, 49,000 has...''

302
01:00:59,455 --> 01:01:04,324
''...to be paid. - 49,000?
- Yes. Read this.''

303
01:01:09,465 --> 01:01:15,495
''No, this is false. You have
cheated us. We were promised...''

304
01:01:15,538 --> 01:01:17,506
''...that rooms will be allotted in
5,000 rupees. You have now...''

305
01:01:18,241 --> 01:01:19,367
''...made it to 50,000!''

306
01:01:19,409 --> 01:01:24,346
Don't dare talk like this. First
get the money & then talk.

307
01:01:31,254 --> 01:01:33,415
''l'm telling you, you'll have to pay
the price for this.''

308
01:01:44,333 --> 01:01:47,359
lt was good that we captured
this business.

309
01:01:47,403 --> 01:01:53,467
Now only Juli's wealth is left.
Did you speak to her about...

310
01:01:53,509 --> 01:01:58,378
''...both of your marriage?
- Yes, but she refused''

311
01:02:09,292 --> 01:02:12,489
We'll have to make her agree.
We want half share in this...

312
01:02:12,528 --> 01:02:15,326
...business & our right on her
property -How?.

313
01:02:21,471 --> 01:02:25,407
What happened? - He had
a heart attack

314
01:02:25,441 --> 01:02:27,409
''Please take care of him, l'll
call a doctor''

315
01:02:36,519 --> 01:02:43,425
Good that you came. Will you
fulfil your father's wish...

316
01:02:43,493 --> 01:02:47,327
...which he declared before
dying-Yes

317
01:02:48,531 --> 01:02:52,365
Then get married to Vicky
- This is impossible

318
01:02:55,271 --> 01:02:59,469
l have to take revenge for my
father's death first

319
01:02:59,509 --> 01:03:06,381
That is your wish. And your
father's wish was that...

320
01:03:06,415 --> 01:03:09,441
...you should be married to Vicky.

321
01:03:12,355 --> 01:03:16,416
Why don't you try to understand?
l can't agree to this marriage

322
01:03:20,496 --> 01:03:24,523
''Please agree, so that l'll have
some peace before my death''

323
01:03:25,268 --> 01:03:28,465
l have brought you up from the
age of 5 as my daughter

324
01:03:28,504 --> 01:03:32,406
Please don't refuse this.

325
01:03:37,446 --> 01:03:43,385
OK -That's great. Now l'll die
after you settle down

326
01:03:44,387 --> 01:03:47,481
''Daddy, doctor is here. - Send him
back, l am alright now...''

327
01:03:47,523 --> 01:03:50,492
...as Julie has agreed for
the engagement.

328
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:58,433
Go & order for the cards to
invite the rich people in city

329
01:03:58,501 --> 01:04:01,493
l have fixed your engagement on
the 2nd of next month

330
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:08,240
''Friend, where is the department
to order for cards?''

331
01:04:22,491 --> 01:04:26,484
So you have come here to take
reward. - lt's a different matter

332
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:32,399
What? - Are Vicky's engagement
cards being printed here

333
01:04:32,435 --> 01:04:41,503
''Yes, there they are -What is
the date there? - 2nd''

334
01:04:44,447 --> 01:04:47,473
Then take this and fix the deal
- What deal?

335
01:04:54,390 --> 01:05:03,389
''Who are you? - l am the famous
journalist, Sony''

336
01:05:07,336 --> 01:05:11,432
l want to take your photograph
and show it to all in the country

337
01:05:14,443 --> 01:05:20,404
You have done a great job by
inviting the porters...

338
01:05:23,519 --> 01:05:27,455
...instead of the wealthy & rich
people for the engagement.

339
01:06:01,524 --> 01:06:03,515
Will you please tell me your
opinion on the fun they're having

340
01:06:18,441 --> 01:06:20,534
Who let you come inside?

341
01:06:22,511 --> 01:06:26,447
How can you say that after
inviting us? Your coridial...

342
01:06:26,515 --> 01:06:31,452
...invitation for your engagement
brought us here. See this card

343
01:06:31,454 --> 01:06:35,447
''What audacity is this? Get out
of here. Michal,''

344
01:06:35,491 --> 01:06:37,482
''See, your Michael is there.''

345
01:06:42,465 --> 01:06:45,457
How can you ask your guests to
go out after inviting them?

346
01:06:45,501 --> 01:06:48,368
This will cause bad
publicity for you.

347
01:06:50,539 --> 01:06:53,406
''Vicky, go & find out why the
guests haven't come yet''

348
01:07:11,427 --> 01:07:17,229
''Uncle it's Vicky -Yes, we
got your card''

349
01:07:17,266 --> 01:07:19,325
Then why didn't you come for
the engagement?

350
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:27,204
But the date is 20th.
- How this 2 became 20?

351
01:07:27,276 --> 01:07:29,471
''The same way as 5,000
became 50,000.''

352
01:07:32,481 --> 01:07:35,348
''You only taught us this tactics,
now we are giving it back to you''

353
01:07:35,384 --> 01:07:42,381
''So this is all your play
- Yes, it is!''

354
01:07:45,428 --> 01:07:50,331
''And until you give us our house,
we will live in your father's...''

355
01:07:50,366 --> 01:07:58,466
...house. - Would you spread some
light on the term 'father's house'

356
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:02,309
So you have applied this
method to claim your house

357
01:08:02,344 --> 01:08:06,474
''Yes, you showed us your way,
now we are showing you ours''

358
01:08:09,251 --> 01:08:11,412
So you want the house
- Yes -That you will get

359
01:08:19,261 --> 01:08:21,422
Your complexion has changed
after they have promised...

360
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:24,399
...to give the house. What is
your opinion in this regard?

361
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:29,393
''l feel the house which they
should get, will anyway...''

362
01:08:29,472 --> 01:08:30,496
...be given to them.

363
01:08:47,356 --> 01:08:49,483
So you want the house
Take this then.

364
01:08:54,463 --> 01:08:57,227
Why? ls it small?

365
01:09:01,303 --> 01:09:04,238
''No, it is much bigger as
compared to your heart''

366
01:09:06,342 --> 01:09:12,372
But now we will fit luxorious
items in this house from here

367
01:09:21,423 --> 01:09:24,392
What have you done? - l was
trying to bring this to the...

368
01:09:24,426 --> 01:09:28,453
''...size of our house. Otherwise,
how will we take them inside?''

369
01:09:31,267 --> 01:09:33,462
Will you spread some light on
this item being taken to...

370
01:09:33,502 --> 01:09:38,462
...your house? - l'll spread many
things now. Just wait & see.

371
01:09:38,507 --> 01:09:40,532
Do you know how costly
this light (Zhumar) was?

372
01:09:41,277 --> 01:09:44,337
Will you comment on its
broken pieces?

373
01:09:46,448 --> 01:09:49,474
''Lqbal, l had to use the
dishes to see my face''

374
01:09:49,518 --> 01:09:52,510
So you need a mirror -Yes
- You'll get it.

375
01:10:06,268 --> 01:10:07,462
Are you able to see your
eace now?. -Yes -Take it

376
01:10:11,473 --> 01:10:13,498
The breaking of glass is
regarded as inauspicious...

377
01:10:14,276 --> 01:10:16,403
...during the time of engagement
& marriage. Will you comment?

378
01:10:19,281 --> 01:10:21,249
We will also need the
watch to see the time.

379
01:10:32,461 --> 01:10:36,329
Take your parts from this watch

380
01:10:39,368 --> 01:10:42,428
l'll see you -This time
keeps moving

381
01:10:45,541 --> 01:10:48,510
''Yesterday it was yours,
today it is mine''

382
01:10:48,510 --> 01:10:53,311
Would you like to
comment on that?

383
01:10:53,382 --> 01:10:54,314
''Call the police, Vicky''

384
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:32,448
What are all these? So you
have reached here too.

385
01:11:32,488 --> 01:11:34,513
We have been invited.

386
01:11:37,359 --> 01:11:39,327
''Uncle, have you got everything
for your house''

387
01:11:39,361 --> 01:11:43,320
Only a wife is lacking
- Then take her

388
01:11:46,368 --> 01:11:50,327
But have a look at yourself.
ls she suitable?

389
01:11:52,341 --> 01:11:55,208
l will keep her for myself

390
01:11:55,277 --> 01:11:57,438
''He is holding my hands in front
of so many people, and you...''

391
01:11:57,479 --> 01:12:02,348
''...are sitting silently? - Had he
come alone, l would have...''

392
01:12:02,384 --> 01:12:06,343
...taught him a great lesson
- Then consider me as alone

393
01:12:09,458 --> 01:12:13,224
''Anyway, l've some pending issues
with you. Should l fix the deal?''

394
01:12:13,262 --> 01:12:15,355
''Yes -OK, leave him.''

395
01:13:11,487 --> 01:13:14,354
Now this iron will pass
through your body

396
01:13:14,423 --> 01:13:22,228
This iron is our weapon. This
can feed us and when necessary...

397
01:13:22,264 --> 01:13:23,458
...can take lives of
people like you

398
01:14:57,459 --> 01:14:59,450
''Uncle, please call the police.''

399
01:15:02,397 --> 01:15:05,389
''Until you give us our house,
these goods will be with us''

400
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:16,501
What do you want to say about
these behaviour of the porters?

401
01:15:19,348 --> 01:15:20,474
Shut up -You shut up now.

402
01:15:40,469 --> 01:15:43,461
''Please let me go, else l'll put
handcuffs in your hands''

403
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:48,400
Before that l'll keep you in
handcuffs. And l'll hand over...

404
01:15:48,443 --> 01:15:53,403
''...your lover to the police.
- Leave me, l say''

405
01:15:53,482 --> 01:15:59,352
''lf you make any noise, l'll break
your body into pieces.''

406
01:16:04,426 --> 01:16:08,328
''Will you have some food -No. -
Not food, l'm asking you to sing''

407
01:16:19,241 --> 01:16:24,372
''Water? See Madam, you get your
water from the tap...''

408
01:16:24,446 --> 01:16:26,471
...here we have our water
from the roof

409
01:16:30,452 --> 01:16:36,448
This is Vividh Bharati. Now
Swami Sewananda will speak...

410
01:16:36,491 --> 01:16:39,483
''...about various techniques of
Yoga exercises.''

411
01:16:42,264 --> 01:16:46,496
Somebody was about to tell
instructions to make omlettes

412
01:16:52,441 --> 01:16:55,501
Today Latif Bhai & Hanif Bhai
will tell you how to prepare...

413
01:16:56,244 --> 01:17:01,409
...French omletes. Are you
prepared with the ingredients?

414
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:07,411
Yes -Now pour one spoonful of
ghee in the frying pan

415
01:17:18,533 --> 01:17:29,376
Now take the egg in your hands
- And jump with one foot

416
01:17:34,449 --> 01:17:40,410
Halt now. - Now put the egg on
the floor and sit on it...

417
01:17:40,489 --> 01:17:42,354
...in the way of Padmasana.

418
01:17:57,372 --> 01:17:59,363
Now let it fry in mild flame

419
01:18:13,388 --> 01:18:18,451
''Now take a green chilly, open
your mouth...''

420
01:18:20,395 --> 01:18:22,295
...& put the chilly on your tongue

421
01:18:36,411 --> 01:18:41,405
Now lie down on the floor
slowly and raise your left leg

422
01:18:43,485 --> 01:18:47,387
Then your right leg -And take an
onion with both your legs

423
01:18:55,397 --> 01:18:57,422
Put it on the floor and thump it

424
01:19:00,435 --> 01:19:07,500
Then put the onion on the frying
pan & wait till it becomes red

425
01:19:10,479 --> 01:19:19,512
''Now stand up, put your hands on
the knee & take a deep breath''

426
01:19:32,501 --> 01:19:41,409
Now take another egg -And
stand on your head

427
01:19:53,421 --> 01:19:58,358
Now have a look at the omlette
- How can l see it now?.

428
01:20:00,228 --> 01:20:06,428
''Madam, how is the omlette
- First class''

429
01:20:13,475 --> 01:20:19,277
Bring your legs down and
stand up slowly

430
01:20:22,484 --> 01:20:30,323
Sit on the floor and put your
left leg on your neck

431
01:20:47,409 --> 01:20:49,468
lt's locked now

432
01:21:03,391 --> 01:21:04,517
''Madam, please release my lock''

433
01:21:11,533 --> 01:21:19,406
So what is your comment on this
condition of yours -Not good

434
01:21:34,489 --> 01:21:39,449
''Don't try to run away, else this
bird will take out both your eyes''

435
01:22:00,382 --> 01:22:06,343
Now listen about the other
instructions -Shut up

436
01:22:09,391 --> 01:22:15,227
Take this pan. l am going out
now and by the time l return...

437
01:22:15,263 --> 01:22:20,360
...the omlette should be ready.

438
01:22:25,273 --> 01:22:30,438
''Allarakha, keep a watch on this
girl, she is very clever.''

439
01:22:56,404 --> 01:22:59,430
''Don't be scared, daughter. This
is a poor man's house...''

440
01:22:59,474 --> 01:23:04,502
...so it shakes even when a train
passes by. l just returned from...

441
01:23:05,246 --> 01:23:09,478
...Sirdhi. l heard that lqbal
brought you here forcefully

442
01:23:09,551 --> 01:23:14,386
How can one reach at a solution
using force? Go home now

443
01:23:17,525 --> 01:23:19,356
Shut up.

444
01:23:34,409 --> 01:23:38,470
You have tortured me a lot. Now
l'll not leave you alive.

445
01:23:47,355 --> 01:23:52,418
''Why are you killing the one who
is already dead? That day, being''

446
01:23:52,460 --> 01:23:57,397
''...desirous of eating omlette from
your hands, when lqbal was on...''

447
01:23:57,399 --> 01:24:02,359
''...his way to the station, he
came under a train''

448
01:24:02,404 --> 01:24:05,464
''And his body was cut into
pieces, & every pieces was...''

449
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:07,405
...taking your name only.

450
01:24:14,382 --> 01:24:16,475
But today's newspaper carried
no news on this

451
01:24:16,518 --> 01:24:21,455
Who will publish the death of
such a poor man?

452
01:24:21,489 --> 01:24:27,359
''Had it been someone like your
Uncle, it would have been...''

453
01:24:27,395 --> 01:24:30,455
''...published. lf you don't believe
me, check for yourself...''

454
01:24:30,498 --> 01:24:33,365
...the porters have erected his
statue in the Rani Garden.

455
01:24:36,438 --> 01:24:42,399
''Please go there and speak out
your heart, at least the soul...''

456
01:24:42,444 --> 01:24:49,509
...of that statue will rest in
piece. l bacome so grief-stricken

457
01:24:50,251 --> 01:24:55,348
''...at the thought of his death,
with so much love in his heart.''

458
01:25:06,468 --> 01:25:07,492
Will you please come there?

459
01:25:12,373 --> 01:25:15,342
What are you thinking? lf you
have anything for him in your...

460
01:25:15,376 --> 01:25:17,435
''...heart, then you should go,
otherwise no need to go.''

461
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:21,381
How long will l stay here with
the umbrella in my hands?

462
01:25:21,449 --> 01:25:24,384
''Until the girl comes here,
stand like this.''

463
01:25:30,492 --> 01:25:32,357
There she comes. Jump now

464
01:25:53,481 --> 01:26:00,387
She is carrying two candles in
her hands-Why-She only knows

465
01:26:22,410 --> 01:26:25,345
''What a life-like statue is built
by the sculptor, as if it'll...''

466
01:26:25,380 --> 01:26:28,349
...speak now itself. - He
can't speak now

467
01:26:35,523 --> 01:26:40,460
lf you didn't hurry that much for
your death & stayed for some...

468
01:26:40,495 --> 01:26:44,488
''...more days, we would have
understood each other better''

469
01:26:50,338 --> 01:26:53,398
When l saw you in the railway
station for the first time...

470
01:26:53,441 --> 01:26:55,409
...l felt something in my heart
- What did you feel?

471
01:26:58,446 --> 01:27:01,381
''Please speak out, why are you
feeling shy in front of a statue?''

472
01:27:01,382 --> 01:27:08,311
''l thought, you will come to my
residence -l didn't know your...''

473
01:27:08,389 --> 01:27:11,381
...address-What? - He didn't
have your address with him

474
01:27:13,261 --> 01:27:17,357
You lifted me in front of
everyone like a luggage.

475
01:27:19,334 --> 01:27:24,465
Actually l liked that manliness on
your part -You should have told...

476
01:27:24,539 --> 01:27:28,373
...that earlier itself. - Had you
told it earlier he need not have...

477
01:27:28,409 --> 01:27:30,377
...to become a statue today
- Why do you speak in between?

478
01:27:31,412 --> 01:27:34,347
''After seeing your photo in the
paper, l cried so much.''

479
01:27:34,382 --> 01:27:37,351
''l don't know, whether that was
my sympathy or love''

480
01:27:37,385 --> 01:27:43,415
People say that loves can even
bring life to a dead again

481
01:27:43,458 --> 01:27:48,486
''lf l also had such strength in my
love, you would be alive''

482
01:27:58,539 --> 01:28:05,445
You are alive! So all this was
a drama-Not this was all love

483
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:08,449
Who told you that l love you?
- Bah! When l was a statue...

484
01:28:08,449 --> 01:28:11,418
...you were showing too much
sympathy. Should l again become...

485
01:28:11,452 --> 01:28:17,448
...a statue? - Do whatever you
want. You are just a 3rd class.

486
01:28:22,230 --> 01:28:31,195
She left! Where have you left me
in the middle of all these chaos?

487
01:28:54,495 --> 01:28:59,455
You? - Come down

488
01:29:09,377 --> 01:29:13,473
What are you doing here? - l am
throwing out the water

489
01:29:13,548 --> 01:29:16,483
''Otherwise, how will l prepare
that special omlette for you?''

490
01:29:16,517 --> 01:29:23,514
But -l have come here on my
own will. And l'll stay here...

491
01:29:24,258 --> 01:29:29,355
...till the porters get
their houses.

492
01:29:34,369 --> 01:29:42,299
Have you really come here
amidst this rain to give...

493
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:58,453
''...house to the porters -No, l've
come here to settle down.''

494
01:30:03,364 --> 01:30:06,231
Allarakha!

495
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:50,468
Both of us are lost in
the love of youth

496
01:30:50,511 --> 01:30:54,413
''And that is neither your
fault, nor mine''

497
01:30:54,449 --> 01:30:58,351
''Neither you saw the signal, nor l''

498
01:30:58,386 --> 01:31:01,446
That is how the accident
took place

499
01:31:09,530 --> 01:31:12,499
Both of us are lost in
the love of youth

500
01:31:12,533 --> 01:31:16,367
''And that is neither your
fault, nor mine''

501
01:31:16,404 --> 01:31:19,464
''Neither you saw the signal, nor l''

502
01:31:19,507 --> 01:31:22,476
That is how the accident
took place

503
01:31:56,511 --> 01:31:58,376
We both are homeless

504
01:31:58,446 --> 01:32:01,472
Neither we could see what is
ahead nor what is behind

505
01:32:01,516 --> 01:32:06,351
We just put our vehicle of the
heart on the tracks

506
01:32:22,370 --> 01:32:25,362
''Neither you saw the track, nor
l saw the flag''

507
01:32:25,406 --> 01:32:28,341
That is how the accident
took place

508
01:32:32,380 --> 01:32:35,440
And also the agreement took
place & it became permanent.

509
01:32:46,360 --> 01:32:47,520
Allarakha

510
01:33:09,417 --> 01:33:16,346
The paths were different and
you were not calculative

511
01:33:16,390 --> 01:33:20,417
You also didn't have a veil
on your face

512
01:33:25,232 --> 01:33:28,360
The attitude of the weather
was also not good

513
01:33:32,473 --> 01:33:35,340
''Neither you saw the danger,
nor l saw''

514
01:33:35,409 --> 01:33:39,436
That is how the accident
took place

515
01:34:16,350 --> 01:34:20,377
Now if there is any loss we will
have to compensate it

516
01:34:20,421 --> 01:34:24,414
And we will have to fall in love

517
01:34:41,375 --> 01:34:43,502
''Neither you blew the
whistle, nor l blew''

518
01:34:44,278 --> 01:34:47,406
That is how the accident
took place

519
01:35:20,481 --> 01:35:23,211
Allarakha

520
01:35:47,341 --> 01:35:49,400
''What are you saying? How can
we allot them the house in 5,000''

521
01:35:49,410 --> 01:35:52,311
''lf they don't get the house, l'll
not get married''

522
01:35:52,346 --> 01:35:54,337
But why are showing that much
sympathy to them?

523
01:35:54,415 --> 01:35:58,249
''After seeing their condition, l
even feel that they should be...''

524
01:35:58,319 --> 01:35:59,479
...given their houses for free.

525
01:36:01,255 --> 01:36:07,216
Will you get married if we
give them the houses

526
01:36:07,328 --> 01:36:13,267
''Yes, but l'll get married only
after the porters get houses.''

527
01:36:16,370 --> 01:36:19,430
''Brothers, there is a good news.
Keep your money ready...''

528
01:36:19,507 --> 01:36:21,407
...we are going to get our
houses soon

529
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:29,381
Let's go and take out the money
from our deposits

530
01:36:36,357 --> 01:36:38,484
Welcome Mr. Goga -Our Madras
office has been raided by police

531
01:36:38,526 --> 01:36:43,361
''Mr. Jafar said that before police
reaches here, run away with...''

532
01:36:43,397 --> 01:36:44,455
...whatever money we have here.

533
01:36:56,510 --> 01:36:59,343
We should be able to run away
before the police arrives here

534
01:37:18,432 --> 01:37:20,491
You came to spy on us?
Come with me

535
01:37:22,536 --> 01:37:25,232
''Sony, you? - Get ready to
go to the jail.''

536
01:37:28,509 --> 01:37:32,309
Take him upstairs and tie him up
Mr. Jafar will decide about him.

537
01:37:34,381 --> 01:37:38,249
l was noticing your activities for
a long time. Now everything is...

538
01:37:38,352 --> 01:37:41,480
...revealed. l'll publish your deeds
in the front page.

539
01:37:57,338 --> 01:38:01,297
The luggage is heavy. Don't you
want porters to lift them?

540
01:38:01,342 --> 01:38:05,301
''You will lift the luggage?
- Yes, because they are ours''

541
01:38:15,489 --> 01:38:18,356
There is no chance to escape.
The building has been...

542
01:38:18,392 --> 01:38:19,416
...surrounded by our men.

543
01:39:12,379 --> 01:39:14,404
''You can't run away, as l have
great strength in this hand.''

544
01:39:16,450 --> 01:39:20,318
You luckily got saved that day.
l will cut your other hand today.

545
01:41:39,493 --> 01:41:43,361
''See, my mother saved
my life today.''

546
01:41:43,397 --> 01:41:46,389
''Therefore, l always carry my
mother's photograph with me.''

547
01:41:52,339 --> 01:41:56,241
Even l also have my mother's
photograph at home

548
01:41:56,276 --> 01:41:59,336
''When l am sad, l always cry in
front of her photograph''

549
01:41:59,379 --> 01:42:03,338
''And when l am happy, then also
l share my happiness with her''

550
01:42:04,518 --> 01:42:08,454
''You are fortunate that you have
your mother also, besides her...''

551
01:42:08,489 --> 01:42:13,222
...photograph. l only have her
photograph with me

552
01:42:15,429 --> 01:42:17,260
Why? What happened to
your mother?

553
01:42:18,465 --> 01:42:21,366
She got separated from me.
- How?.

554
01:42:23,537 --> 01:42:28,338
lt happened long ago. When l
was eight years old.

555
01:42:32,346 --> 01:42:36,476
''There was a flood in our village,
and all the village was floating''

556
01:42:39,419 --> 01:42:44,356
Both my parents were carried
away in that flood

557
01:42:50,264 --> 01:42:53,427
''After few months, l saw her in
the railway platform''

558
01:42:56,370 --> 01:43:05,472
l introduced myself to her. But
she looked at me with a lost...

559
01:43:06,246 --> 01:43:11,513
...look. As if she doesn't
recognise me.

560
01:43:13,487 --> 01:43:15,387
You could have told me about
her. l would publish her...

561
01:43:15,422 --> 01:43:17,515
''...photo in the newspaper and
wherever she is, we'll find her.''

562
01:43:18,258 --> 01:43:19,418
What was her name?

563
01:43:24,531 --> 01:43:26,499
Salma -Salma?

564
01:43:28,502 --> 01:43:32,233
My mother's name is also Salma.
Do you know her whereabouts?

565
01:43:32,272 --> 01:43:34,240
l heard that she was in abroad.

566
01:44:09,509 --> 01:44:10,498
Mother!

567
01:44:15,515 --> 01:44:20,475
''l am your son, lqbal. l have
come to take you with me.''

568
01:44:25,259 --> 01:44:33,223
Try to remember how happy we
were. The flood destroyed all.

569
01:44:35,502 --> 01:44:41,407
''Please embrace me as your son,
otherwise l'll give up my...''

570
01:44:41,475 --> 01:44:51,476
''...life crying in your lap. Since
childhood, there was not...''

571
01:44:51,518 --> 01:44:56,512
...a day on which l didn't
remember when l was alone.

572
01:45:02,529 --> 01:45:07,466
''Years after, my annoyed fate is
having it's mercy on me...''

573
01:45:07,501 --> 01:45:11,460
...and l finally found you again.

574
01:45:11,538 --> 01:45:20,537
''The aim of my life is fulfilled.
Come with me, mother.''

575
01:45:30,424 --> 01:45:34,451
Halt. We have come to arrest
you -For which crime?

576
01:45:34,528 --> 01:45:38,464
For trying to abduct her.
- She is my mother

577
01:45:38,498 --> 01:45:45,404
He is telling a lie. She is not his
mother. Ask her the truth.

578
01:45:46,540 --> 01:45:52,240
ls he your son? -She can't speak
& she has lost her memory

579
01:45:54,348 --> 01:45:55,508
What proof do you have that
she is your mother?

580
01:45:56,249 --> 01:45:59,377
''Tear off my heart & see, you
will find her picture in it.''

581
01:45:59,419 --> 01:46:01,387
Law doesn't accept such
arguments

582
01:46:01,421 --> 01:46:04,356
''lf your law doesn't accept it, l
am also not going to obey it''

583
01:46:07,227 --> 01:46:12,460
l'll take my mother with me
anyway. Let's see who stops me.

584
01:46:48,368 --> 01:46:50,359
Mother!

585
01:47:19,433 --> 01:47:20,491
Beat him

586
01:47:37,484 --> 01:47:40,453
Don't talk rubbish. He is not
Salma's son. He came to rob...

587
01:47:40,454 --> 01:47:46,290
''...some money. - You have robbed
him of his greatest wealth,''

588
01:47:46,326 --> 01:47:49,386
His mother. And it is not a crime
to steal from a thief's house

589
01:47:49,429 --> 01:47:53,365
Sony -Don't shout. l know very
well about your business

590
01:47:53,400 --> 01:47:57,461
And how you have looted the
portars of their money...

591
01:47:58,238 --> 01:48:04,473
...through your Bob Chit Funds.
All the details are recorded here.

592
01:48:09,249 --> 01:48:15,347
''lf you don't return my brother's
right to him, l'll publish...''

593
01:48:15,388 --> 01:48:18,414
...all your secrets in the
newspaper tomorrow.

594
01:48:21,328 --> 01:48:25,458
''And if l agree to you, then?
- Then l'll not publish it''

595
01:48:28,268 --> 01:48:29,326
''Wait here, l'll just bring
the cheque''

596
01:48:31,505 --> 01:48:33,302
Mother!

597
01:48:33,340 --> 01:48:35,205
l will surely bring your
son to you.

598
01:48:37,511 --> 01:48:38,443
Take the cheque.

599
01:48:45,519 --> 01:48:47,316
This is Jafar here. - Yes Sir

600
01:48:47,354 --> 01:48:52,485
''Sony knows a lot about us
already, Finish him.''

601
01:49:50,517 --> 01:49:53,452
There have been lots of enemies
in our business

602
01:49:53,486 --> 01:49:56,353
They must have tried to take
our son's life

603
01:50:06,266 --> 01:50:12,330
l'll take you to Dargah Sharif
today. You can pray there...

604
01:50:12,372 --> 01:50:17,275
...and thank Lord for saving
our son's life.

605
01:50:17,344 --> 01:50:20,438
l'll come back after signing
some documents.

606
01:50:27,354 --> 01:50:29,515
''He is coming out from the jail
after 14 years, and you want...''

607
01:50:30,256 --> 01:50:32,486
...to take her to the Dargah!
- Where is the Dargah?

608
01:50:32,525 --> 01:50:40,455
''ln front of the jail -As soon as
he comes out of the jail...''

609
01:50:45,338 --> 01:50:47,363
''Her son's life was saved, so she
has come here to spread a sheet''

610
01:50:47,407 --> 01:50:53,471
May Lord always keep you
happy with your husband

611
01:51:20,273 --> 01:51:28,476
Where will you go now?. -l will
ask Lord out there about it

612
01:51:28,515 --> 01:51:31,484
And pray to him to return me
whatever l have already lost

613
01:52:16,496 --> 01:52:19,488
Do you recognise this tomb?
- This is my master's tomb

614
01:52:19,532 --> 01:52:23,468
You are only responsible to
make him reach here.

615
01:52:25,371 --> 01:52:33,278
''Me? But who are you?
- l am his daughter, Julie''

616
01:52:37,517 --> 01:52:40,486
''l was waiting for this day for
14 years, when you will come...''

617
01:52:40,520 --> 01:52:44,479
...out of the jail after serving
life-time imprisonment.

618
01:52:44,524 --> 01:52:50,429
l take oath that l haven't
murdered him

619
01:52:50,463 --> 01:52:52,454
That'll will be
proved right now

620
01:53:00,507 --> 01:53:06,343
''lf my end has really come
closer, let me thank Lord''

621
01:53:20,426 --> 01:53:24,385
l gave you five chances to prove
your innocence. lt seems you are...

622
01:53:24,464 --> 01:53:31,233
...not guilty. - l told the same
thing in the court many times

623
01:53:35,475 --> 01:53:39,411
But this poor man's voice was
suppressed by power of wealth

624
01:53:39,445 --> 01:53:43,245
Then who killed my father?

625
01:53:47,387 --> 01:53:53,485
''When l was drowning, a person
came to my rescue as an angel''

626
01:53:56,462 --> 01:54:02,264
And that was your father. l had
already lost my wife & son

627
01:54:02,335 --> 01:54:05,395
''Had l not received the help of
your father, l would be dead''

628
01:54:07,273 --> 01:54:12,506
He gave me a job in his factory.
Once he issued bonus for the...

629
01:54:13,246 --> 01:54:17,307
...employees for 6 months. But
his partner made us sign for...

630
01:54:17,350 --> 01:54:20,342
''...receiving 6 months bonus,
though he gave us just 1 month's''

631
01:54:20,386 --> 01:54:24,413
''When he came to know about
this, he called his partner.''

632
01:54:27,493 --> 01:54:31,395
Although his partner tried to
prove his innocence at first...

633
01:54:31,431 --> 01:54:35,367
...he asked him to do whatever
he can. As your father was...

634
01:54:35,435 --> 01:54:39,371
''...about to call the police, he
take out his pistol and...''

635
01:54:39,405 --> 01:54:41,464
''...before l could do anything,
he killed him.''

636
01:54:41,541 --> 01:54:45,500
''By seeing me, he threw the
pistol towards me and as l...''

637
01:54:46,279 --> 01:54:50,477
''...tried to run away, two of his
servants caught me and...''

638
01:54:50,483 --> 01:54:56,422
...began to tell me that l am the
killer. You also came to your...

639
01:54:56,489 --> 01:55:00,425
...father by that time and found
your father dead...

640
01:55:02,495 --> 01:55:06,488
''...and when you came out, he
showed me to you as the...''

641
01:55:06,532 --> 01:55:14,405
...killer and you also considered
me as the same only.

642
01:55:16,509 --> 01:55:20,468
What's the name of that
partner? - Jafar

643
01:55:26,452 --> 01:55:29,421
How did you like the idea?
- Let's not mix friendship...

644
01:55:29,455 --> 01:55:33,482
...with business. We will have to
spend about 50/60 lakhs...

645
01:55:33,526 --> 01:55:36,359
...in supporting you in the
election. What will be our profit

646
01:55:36,396 --> 01:55:41,231
Earlier also you have shared in
my losses. Let's try this too

647
01:55:41,334 --> 01:55:45,293
''lf l win the election, whatever
tender has to be passed...''

648
01:55:45,371 --> 01:55:47,430
...all will be passed in your
name. What do you feel?

649
01:55:50,343 --> 01:55:54,507
''But who will vote for you?
- He is right, Jafar''

650
01:55:55,448 --> 01:55:59,475
''That's why l told you, if you
allot the houses to the porters...''

651
01:55:59,519 --> 01:56:01,316
...they will be useful in
the time of election.

652
01:56:04,424 --> 01:56:06,289
Take these documents for
your new house.

653
01:56:08,328 --> 01:56:12,458
''And tell that guy, what is his
name -lqbal''

654
01:56:15,301 --> 01:56:18,270
That l have kept my promise

655
01:56:21,407 --> 01:56:26,242
Are you happy now?. - Yes.
- l have done all these...

656
01:56:26,312 --> 01:56:28,473
''...for your happiness only. Now l
have kept my promise, it's now...''

657
01:56:29,248 --> 01:56:31,443
...your turn to keep the promise
- What promise?

658
01:56:31,517 --> 01:56:33,485
To marry me

659
01:56:35,388 --> 01:56:43,295
''l'll definitely marry, but not you,
l'll marry lqbal''

660
01:56:45,264 --> 01:56:47,494
What? Julie said this
to you? - Yes

661
01:56:49,469 --> 01:56:57,308
''Son, follow my principle.
Whatever you want get it...''

662
01:56:57,377 --> 01:56:59,436
''...and if you can't get it,
finish it''

663
01:57:01,481 --> 01:57:08,284
''No, l'll not finish Julie
but that porter lqbal!''

664
01:58:04,277 --> 01:58:08,236
''l have fallen in love, friends''

665
01:58:08,281 --> 01:58:10,442
Ask about my condition

666
01:58:20,326 --> 01:58:25,457
She stole my eyes in the
midst of the market

667
01:58:35,475 --> 01:58:41,311
My eyes are also stolen
in this age

668
01:58:49,388 --> 01:58:53,381
l have fallen in love

669
01:59:24,390 --> 01:59:27,257
Love makes the
youth meet

670
01:59:27,293 --> 01:59:30,421
And it creates the story

671
01:59:32,365 --> 01:59:35,266
When the clouds come
down from the mountains

672
01:59:35,268 --> 01:59:38,328
lts causes the shower
of water everywhere

673
01:59:47,380 --> 01:59:52,408
This time the thunder of
Spring also fell on me

674
01:59:54,453 --> 01:59:57,422
l have fallen in love

675
02:00:01,427 --> 02:00:05,227
Ask about my condition

676
02:00:30,256 --> 02:00:35,455
''Don't delay now, and make me
the bride-groom''

677
02:00:44,403 --> 02:00:48,237
You males can't be trusted easily

678
02:00:48,307 --> 02:00:51,299
Ask for the pen & paper

679
02:00:59,418 --> 02:01:05,220
l have written whole my
life in your name

680
02:01:09,428 --> 02:01:11,396
l have fallen in love

681
02:01:47,466 --> 02:01:49,297
Mother!

682
02:02:08,287 --> 02:02:10,255
Although we have taken out the
bullet from the body...

683
02:02:10,289 --> 02:02:13,258
...but the gun-powder have
spread over the whole body.

684
02:02:13,292 --> 02:02:15,226
Her condition is very
unpredictable now

685
02:02:18,297 --> 02:02:19,264
How is her condition now?.

686
02:02:27,239 --> 02:02:33,337
''Please save my mother's life,
brother. l promise...''

687
02:02:33,379 --> 02:02:39,284
''...if you save her this time,
l'll never drink again.''

688
02:02:45,458 --> 02:02:56,335
Don't be worried. Lord is very
kind hearted. He listens to all.

689
02:03:03,442 --> 02:03:04,409
What's the matter?

690
02:03:22,294 --> 02:03:28,233
l understood. You are asking me
to go to the Haj.

691
02:03:30,469 --> 02:03:37,238
Now l'll go for Haj with your
inspiration.

692
02:03:41,447 --> 02:03:46,350
''On behalf of the Haj Committee,
l welcome all the Haj pilgrims...''

693
02:03:46,419 --> 02:03:52,449
...and request them to keep all
their documents ready to...

694
02:03:52,458 --> 02:03:56,417
...show at the gate.

695
02:04:01,333 --> 02:04:03,494
You are having high fever. Go
for the medical check up.

696
02:04:09,341 --> 02:04:12,435
''You are really sick -Don't worry
about my sickness, let me go''

697
02:04:12,478 --> 02:04:17,347
''No, it'll be against the law. Until
the nature of your disease is...''

698
02:04:17,416 --> 02:04:21,284
''...found, you will not be
allowed to leave.''

699
02:04:22,421 --> 02:04:25,219
l am going to the holiest place.
By Lord's mercy even the most...

700
02:04:25,257 --> 02:04:27,350
...uncurable diseases will also
get cured there

701
02:04:27,426 --> 02:04:31,226
''You are right. But l am helpless,
as l'll have to abide by the...''

702
02:04:31,263 --> 02:04:34,232
...rules & regulations between
both the countries.

703
02:04:51,450 --> 02:04:54,283
''Maula Sahab, please ask them to
permit me to go for Haj.''

704
02:04:57,356 --> 02:05:00,450
''My mother is seriously ill, and
there is little chance of...''

705
02:05:00,493 --> 02:05:05,453
...her being saved. l have come
with a great hope. l'll pray for...

706
02:05:09,535 --> 02:05:18,341
''...her life in Madina. - See, this
is Allaha's wish.''

707
02:05:18,377 --> 02:05:26,284
''Until one gets the call from Him,
he can't make it to that place''

708
02:05:28,387 --> 02:05:33,347
Look at this person. He is lying
here for 15 days without food

709
02:05:33,425 --> 02:05:39,364
''He says if he can't go on Haj,
he'll give up his life here''

710
02:05:41,433 --> 02:05:44,334
''All his documents are ready, but
he doesn't have the money...''

711
02:05:44,336 --> 02:05:48,432
''...for the ticket. You have the
ticket, but you can't go.''

712
02:05:52,444 --> 02:05:54,275
Why don't you do one help?

713
02:05:54,313 --> 02:05:59,341
What is that? - Send him in your
place. He will pray on your...

714
02:05:59,385 --> 02:06:03,287
...behalf and your mother's life
will get a new life.

715
02:06:28,314 --> 02:06:30,373
''Uncle, do you want
to go for Haj?''

716
02:06:33,419 --> 02:06:38,413
''Yes, all through life He takes
one's test. Today, l'm taking his...''

717
02:06:38,457 --> 02:06:44,487
...test. l want to see whether His
mercy fall on some poor also...

718
02:06:45,264 --> 02:06:48,495
...or not. Whether he calls me or
not -He has called you

719
02:06:54,506 --> 02:07:02,345
Me? - Yes. You will go to Haj in
my place. But you will have to...

720
02:07:02,381 --> 02:07:08,342
...beg for His mercy to save my
mother's life on my behalf

721
02:07:10,456 --> 02:07:14,290
Please save her life.

722
02:07:26,305 --> 02:07:30,332
''Years ago, my son had promised
me that he will send me for Haj''

723
02:07:30,376 --> 02:07:37,282
...one day. Now it feels as if my
lost son is fulfilling his promise

724
02:07:52,398 --> 02:07:53,422
Haj Mubarak!

725
02:07:53,465 --> 02:07:56,366
May Lord keep you & your
mother in good health

726
02:08:29,468 --> 02:08:33,302
Haj Mubarak to all of you

727
02:08:39,411 --> 02:08:43,245
lt's was not in my fate to
go for Madina

728
02:08:43,315 --> 02:08:50,244
Please convey my salutations to
Lord of Madina

729
02:10:07,432 --> 02:10:11,266
Nobody is great or humble there

730
02:10:11,303 --> 02:10:15,433
All are equal in front of Him

731
02:11:53,405 --> 02:12:01,471
l am quite far away
from your abode.

732
02:12:01,513 --> 02:12:06,382
Please accept my presence
from here itself

733
02:12:06,418 --> 02:12:10,377
And have your mercy on me

734
02:12:27,306 --> 02:12:28,466
You know everything

735
02:12:28,507 --> 02:12:31,305
What is there for me to tell you

736
02:12:31,343 --> 02:12:35,302
lf you just give an indication
everything will be fine

737
02:12:46,425 --> 02:12:50,293
Please don't separate a
mother from her son

738
02:12:53,498 --> 02:12:57,332
lf mother's death
is written in fate...

739
02:13:00,339 --> 02:13:03,365
...please change it and
save her life

740
02:13:10,349 --> 02:13:14,308
Lord of Madina

741
02:13:52,290 --> 02:13:53,416
''Brother, mother has got
back her senses''

742
02:13:56,461 --> 02:14:00,261
Your mother is alright now. But
don't talk to her for long.

743
02:14:41,273 --> 02:14:45,300
Both his kidneys have failed
due to too much drinking

744
02:14:45,343 --> 02:14:46,435
''Anyway, one kidney is
enough for one to survive...''

745
02:14:46,478 --> 02:14:50,244
...but his kidney has to be
replaced with the one from...

746
02:14:50,282 --> 02:14:55,310
''...a living person. As his father,
you can donate your kidney''

747
02:14:57,456 --> 02:15:04,328
Don't speak about this to my son
or my wife regarding this

748
02:15:04,362 --> 02:15:09,390
''Even if he was my own son, l
wouldn't have given my kidney''

749
02:15:09,434 --> 02:15:15,270
''Then isn't he your own son?
- No, once when my wife was...''

750
02:15:15,340 --> 02:15:20,300
''...seriously ill, the doctor treating
her advised me to bring a child...''

751
02:15:20,345 --> 02:15:27,342
''...for her, so l brought him
from an orphanage.''

752
02:16:03,421 --> 02:16:10,224
''Why are you doing this, Sony?
- Who are you to question me?''

753
02:16:10,262 --> 02:16:15,290
''l am your elder brother.
- Listen to him, friends''

754
02:16:18,403 --> 02:16:21,304
''When l don't even have my
parents, how can l have a...''

755
02:16:21,339 --> 02:16:31,408
...brother? - Don't say like this
- Fate of both of us has been...

756
02:16:33,351 --> 02:16:38,482
...written with an evil pen. You
had to keep away from your...

757
02:16:39,257 --> 02:16:43,421
''...mother you had, and she
got separated from me...''

758
02:16:43,461 --> 02:16:45,224
...though she was with me.

759
02:16:49,367 --> 02:16:52,336
And the relation between us is...

760
02:16:52,370 --> 02:16:57,307
...also finished today. l'm just an
orphan from Kanpur.

761
02:17:30,442 --> 02:17:35,311
''Uncle, call for a taxi. My doubt
was right. He was drinking here.''

762
02:17:35,347 --> 02:17:38,407
Now we will have to take him
to the hospital immediately.

763
02:17:44,389 --> 02:17:47,256
Why does he drink so much?
- Since he came to know...

764
02:17:47,292 --> 02:17:50,352
...that Mr. Jafar has brought him
from an orphanage in Kanpur...

765
02:17:50,395 --> 02:17:51,362
...he is just going on drinking.

766
02:18:03,241 --> 02:18:05,402
My son! He is my lost son. l
recognised him...

767
02:18:05,477 --> 02:18:10,380
...by the mark in his foot.
- Take him to the hospital...

768
02:18:10,415 --> 02:18:13,441
...immediately. His kidneys are
not in good health

769
02:18:14,252 --> 02:18:15,310
l'll give my kydney to
save his life

770
02:18:42,514 --> 02:18:47,315
You can't carry any picture to
the operation theatre

771
02:18:49,254 --> 02:18:54,317
''What happened? - Lqbal brother,
this is my beloved's photograph...''

772
02:18:54,359 --> 02:19:00,264
...who got separated from me in
childhood. lf something happens...

773
02:19:00,298 --> 02:19:05,235
...to me -You are always upto
delivering dialogues

774
02:19:07,405 --> 02:19:09,373
You will be alright in
few moments.

775
02:19:21,386 --> 02:19:25,254
Where is Sony? -He's been
taken to the operation theatre

776
02:19:28,493 --> 02:19:32,429
''He is mad. He was telling me
that if anything happens to him...''

777
02:19:37,435 --> 02:19:38,424
Nothing will happen to him.

778
02:19:47,312 --> 02:19:52,272
This is my picture. - What
are you saying?

779
02:19:54,386 --> 02:19:57,321
We were studying in the same
school in childhood.

780
02:20:01,459 --> 02:20:03,393
Then we both got separated
from each other

781
02:20:10,368 --> 02:20:12,336
Congratulations! The operation
was successful

782
02:20:25,283 --> 02:20:27,376
We have organised a function to
welcome the minister today

783
02:20:27,452 --> 02:20:30,421
lt'll be good if our wedding is
also performed in this ceremony...

784
02:20:30,455 --> 02:20:37,293
''...itself. - Before getting married,
l have to recover some debts.''

785
02:20:38,496 --> 02:20:43,263
The whole life is left for that.
But Lord has given just four...

786
02:20:43,301 --> 02:20:48,238
''...days for the youth. lf those
days are gone...''

787
02:20:50,275 --> 02:20:55,235
''...the signal will be down, and
the train will leave.''

788
02:21:23,308 --> 02:21:27,335
The train of the youth should
not be missed

789
02:21:31,416 --> 02:21:35,318
Our hearts should not be broken
in the game of love

790
02:21:35,353 --> 02:21:39,289
Nobody should steal
both our tickets

791
02:21:44,295 --> 02:21:47,321
Nobody should hide after
robbing both of us

792
02:22:43,388 --> 02:22:46,380
l am your engine & you
are my bogie

793
02:22:51,429 --> 02:22:55,365
The bogie starts moving after
being connected to the engine.

794
02:23:00,471 --> 02:23:05,431
Our connections
should not be separated

795
02:23:36,374 --> 02:23:39,309
The well is so deep

796
02:23:44,315 --> 02:23:48,274
That my hip is now paining
after filling water

797
02:24:26,391 --> 02:24:29,383
Come to the terrace secretly

798
02:24:34,465 --> 02:24:38,299
Remove the latch and
open the door

799
02:24:41,305 --> 02:24:45,241
This youthful night should
not go away

800
02:24:45,276 --> 02:24:52,444
Nobody should rob tickets
from both of us.

801
02:25:19,377 --> 02:25:27,341
''Bless your son, Parvati.
Had you been alive today...''

802
02:25:29,287 --> 02:25:32,415
''Don't be sad, father. l am with
you. You have given me a new...''

803
02:25:32,457 --> 02:25:35,392
...life by giving a part of you to
me. Now l'll not allow you...

804
02:25:35,426 --> 02:25:38,224
''...to work anymore. From today,
l'll carry luggages''

805
02:25:39,330 --> 02:25:43,232
''No, Lord has made you a
journalist. You should publish...''

806
02:25:43,267 --> 02:25:48,432
...the tortures on the poor &
make our voice reach the govt.

807
02:25:53,478 --> 02:25:55,446
Why are you taking my
photograph?

808
02:25:55,480 --> 02:26:00,440
''Otherwise, how will we make
your poster, as you are...''

809
02:26:09,427 --> 02:26:13,363
Have you gone mad? One should
be educated to be a leader.

810
02:26:13,397 --> 02:26:17,333
And l am not educated. - Do you
think that all our ministers...

811
02:26:17,368 --> 02:26:20,462
''...are educated? Once you are in
the chair, you get all the wisdom''

812
02:26:25,376 --> 02:26:29,472
''Only a poor can understand
about poverty, and one in need...''

813
02:26:30,281 --> 02:26:34,445
...knows what is needed. Only
you will be able to understand...

814
02:26:34,485 --> 02:26:38,353
''...the plight of a porter, because
you yourself are one.''

815
02:26:38,389 --> 02:26:41,381
But l don't know how
to give lectures

816
02:26:43,294 --> 02:26:44,454
Then how do you keep on talking
like a radio the whole day

817
02:26:47,365 --> 02:26:49,299
But money is also needed to
fight in the election

818
02:26:50,501 --> 02:26:53,231
''That is not called election,
when the votes are bought''

819
02:26:53,271 --> 02:26:55,262
All the labourers
will support you.

820
02:27:00,344 --> 02:27:04,337
''What do you say, Allarakha?
You will be the party's symbol.''

821
02:27:07,251 --> 02:27:10,448
We will have to defeat that
Jafar who buys vote with money.

822
02:27:15,326 --> 02:27:17,385
Remove poverty and put your
stamp on the flame.

823
02:27:17,395 --> 02:27:21,354
''lf you want your prosperity,
vote for the flame.''

824
02:27:21,432 --> 02:27:24,367
This flame will bring light
to your life

825
02:27:32,476 --> 02:27:36,412
So cast your vote in favour of
famous Jafar Khan.

826
02:27:47,458 --> 02:27:55,365
''Jafar -Aha, Aslam Bhai''

827
02:28:00,371 --> 02:28:03,431
''Since you have come out of the
jail, l'm looking for you only''

828
02:28:04,275 --> 02:28:06,402
To ask forgivance for my crimes

829
02:28:06,410 --> 02:28:10,403
l have good news for you.
Both your wife & son are alive

830
02:28:10,448 --> 02:28:14,441
They are alive! Where are they?

831
02:28:14,485 --> 02:28:17,249
They are with me. Please come.
l will take you to them.

832
02:29:41,339 --> 02:29:42,363
Lqbal!

833
02:30:07,365 --> 02:30:12,268
''Jafar, l'll not let you reach
the election platform''

834
02:31:17,368 --> 02:31:20,360
Long Live lqbal!

835
02:31:34,318 --> 02:31:37,344
''Thank you all. Actually you all
should live long, as you...''

836
02:31:37,388 --> 02:31:41,415
...have brought me from an
railway platform to contest...

837
02:31:41,459 --> 02:31:44,394
...an election and answer
boldly to the rich people.

838
02:31:48,365 --> 02:31:52,324
Please ask me whatever
questions you have for me.

839
02:31:54,338 --> 02:31:57,239
You are an uneducated man. How
will you be able to fulfil...

840
02:31:57,308 --> 02:31:59,435
...the demands of lakhs of
people. Will you be able to...

841
02:31:59,477 --> 02:32:02,412
...provide them their daily bread?

842
02:32:04,281 --> 02:32:06,442
''No mortal can provide anyone
bread, as Lord only provides...''

843
02:32:06,484 --> 02:32:10,420
...bread to everyone. He gives
everyone two hands...

844
02:32:10,454 --> 02:32:14,390
...and asks him to get his share
of the bread from the earth

845
02:32:17,228 --> 02:32:20,391
But you rich people even snatch
away the poor man's share...

846
02:32:20,464 --> 02:32:25,265
...of breads. You take away our
blood. And if you can...

847
02:32:25,302 --> 02:32:27,327
...you will even sell our souls.

848
02:32:32,443 --> 02:32:35,412
Do you think that the world runs
because you carry the weight?

849
02:32:35,412 --> 02:32:39,212
''To look after crores of
labourers, a rich man is very...''

850
02:32:39,283 --> 02:32:44,380
...necessary. The world will not
run without the rich

851
02:32:44,421 --> 02:32:49,358
How can you say that? Have you
ever heard of a rich man...

852
02:32:49,393 --> 02:32:53,329
''...being shot dead on the road?
You won't listen, because it is...''

853
02:32:53,364 --> 02:32:56,424
...always the poor who are made
to receive the shot on behalf...

854
02:32:56,467 --> 02:33:03,339
...of the rich. This world is run
by the poor. Because right from...

855
02:33:03,374 --> 02:33:06,502
''...Tajmahal to every construction
around, all are being built with...''

856
02:33:07,244 --> 02:33:10,441
...the help of the poor who carry
the bricks on their shoulders.

857
02:33:13,484 --> 02:33:17,215
Whatever the rich people build
are due to their bribes.

858
02:33:17,254 --> 02:33:21,384
''Somebody buys a vote
for 10 rupees...''

859
02:33:21,458 --> 02:33:25,360
''...applications are cleared by
paying 100 rupees, one passes...''

860
02:33:25,396 --> 02:33:29,264
''...exams by paying 1000, and
passes a tender by paying 1 lakh''

861
02:33:29,300 --> 02:33:31,427
''l feel, we should first fail
these corrupt rich people of...''

862
02:33:31,468 --> 02:33:34,335
''...the world, then only our
country will pass.''

863
02:33:37,408 --> 02:33:41,367
''Son, halt his tongue, else, l'll
again have a heart attack''

864
02:33:41,412 --> 02:33:43,277
Will l have to answer this
myself?

865
02:33:46,317 --> 02:33:48,444
''Wait, l'll give you the
answer for this''

866
02:33:57,294 --> 02:34:05,360
''Brothers, he didn't want me to
reach you, so he tried to...''

867
02:34:05,402 --> 02:34:11,307
...kill me through his beloved.
- This is not true

868
02:34:13,444 --> 02:34:18,279
''This is true. But, though he
tried to shower bullets on...''

869
02:34:18,349 --> 02:34:20,374
''...me, l'll only shower flowers
on him.''

870
02:34:28,425 --> 02:34:31,258
Don't turn before you
listen to me.

871
02:34:34,265 --> 02:34:37,257
''Your father Aslam is alive, and
he is in my custody now.''

872
02:34:42,239 --> 02:34:45,208
Look at the old man in the
front platform

873
02:34:57,421 --> 02:35:00,481
His life is in my hands now. lf
you want to see him alive...

874
02:35:01,258 --> 02:35:03,283
...take back your candidature

875
02:35:14,338 --> 02:35:19,366
''Uncle, is that old man my
father?''

876
02:35:28,452 --> 02:35:31,216
''Aslam bhai! Yes, he is your
father.''

877
02:35:41,432 --> 02:35:45,459
''Brothers, while putting the
garland around my neck...''

878
02:35:46,236 --> 02:35:50,263
...Mr. Jafar has made a promise
to do such a great work that...

879
02:35:50,307 --> 02:35:55,438
...l can't contest against him any
more. My best wishes are...

880
02:35:55,479 --> 02:36:06,413
...now for him. And l'm taking
back my candidature.

881
02:36:30,447 --> 02:36:34,349
''Brothers, the reason behind
lqbal's taking back the...''

882
02:36:34,385 --> 02:36:38,481
...candidature must be that Mr.
Jafar has compelled him for...

883
02:36:39,256 --> 02:36:44,216
...this. Listen to this lady
to know the real character...

884
02:36:44,294 --> 02:36:45,420
...of Mr. Jafar.

885
02:36:59,410 --> 02:37:04,370
Aslam Aleiqum to my husband
& lqbal's father

886
02:37:08,419 --> 02:37:13,379
''How is she able to speak?
- Mother, father's life...''

887
02:37:13,457 --> 02:37:18,485
...is in danger. So don't speak
anything against Jafar now

888
02:37:19,263 --> 02:37:22,357
''The Lord who made me meet my
lost son, will surely...''

889
02:37:22,366 --> 02:37:24,334
...protect my husband.

890
02:37:28,272 --> 02:37:32,299
''You must be astonished to see
me speaking, isn't it Mr. Jafar?''

891
02:37:32,376 --> 02:37:37,404
lt's the grace of Lord that He
gave my voice & memory on time.

892
02:37:37,414 --> 02:37:40,247
Cut the connection of
that microphone.

893
02:37:41,452 --> 02:37:48,415
This Jafar is in reality is a
fraud and sinner. He has ruined...

894
02:37:48,425 --> 02:37:50,290
...many families.

895
02:37:56,500 --> 02:37:59,469
You can't stop my voice today by
disconnecting the mike.

896
02:38:00,270 --> 02:38:03,433
Today l'll make my voice reach
to everyone at any cost.

897
02:38:03,474 --> 02:38:05,442
He killed my father.

898
02:38:08,479 --> 02:38:11,312
''And for twenty years, he was
giving me electric shocks...''

899
02:38:11,348 --> 02:38:15,444
...so that l would forget about
my husband & my son.

900
02:38:20,424 --> 02:38:23,416
l was giving her electric shocks
because her doctor had advised...

901
02:38:23,460 --> 02:38:27,362
...me to do so to prevent her
from being mad.

902
02:38:29,466 --> 02:38:32,230
''lf you don't believe me, ask him.''

903
02:38:33,437 --> 02:38:39,273
''Friends, Mr. Jafar has spent his
whole life searching for Aslam''

904
02:38:39,309 --> 02:38:43,302
''And when he finally found him,
he brought him here so that...''

905
02:38:43,380 --> 02:38:49,410
...the husband can meet his lost
wife & son in front of every one.

906
02:38:51,455 --> 02:38:55,391
To speak against such an angel
is to speak against humanity.

907
02:38:58,362 --> 02:39:00,330
''Please go forward and meet your
family, Aslam''

908
02:39:07,404 --> 02:39:12,307
What are you doing? - l am doing
the right thing. l have invested...

909
02:39:12,376 --> 02:39:15,368
''...lots of money in this election.
lf we lose the election, all the...''

910
02:39:15,445 --> 02:39:17,345
...money will go waste. And if
the crowd is agitated...

911
02:39:17,381 --> 02:39:19,349
...they will tear us into pieces.
- l don't care about your money...

912
02:39:19,416 --> 02:39:22,283
...or the election. l have never
learnt to accept defeat.

913
02:39:24,254 --> 02:39:25,414
''lf Salma can't be mine in this
life, l'll not let her...''

914
02:39:25,455 --> 02:39:27,218
...become anyone's too.

915
02:39:39,369 --> 02:39:41,337
''Let's run away from this place,
as there'll be a chaos here now.''

916
02:39:50,380 --> 02:39:51,404
Father!

917
02:39:58,355 --> 02:40:00,380
''Now l am going, as
l have got the signal''

918
02:40:04,361 --> 02:40:07,421
''Son, lqbal
He is the one...''

919
02:40:56,380 --> 02:40:58,439
''Vicky, we have to break
this and go.''

920
02:41:22,305 --> 02:41:23,294
Move away or l will
shoot you

921
02:41:27,310 --> 02:41:28,277
Leave me

922
02:42:57,300 --> 02:42:59,291
Leave me- You can't go inside
the holy place of Haji Ali

923
02:43:01,304 --> 02:43:03,272
No one can stop me.

924
02:43:10,313 --> 02:43:12,440
Leave me.

925
02:43:25,328 --> 02:43:27,319
Please show your miracle.

926
02:43:37,307 --> 02:43:39,332
How long will you survive?
Three bullets are still there.

927
02:43:40,310 --> 02:43:44,303
Shoot at me. lf you have the
weapon of death in your hand...

928
02:43:44,347 --> 02:43:48,340
...then l also have God's
name in my chest.

929
02:43:49,386 --> 02:43:55,325
Let's see whether this sheet
can protect me or not.

930
02:46:05,255 --> 02:46:07,348
My son!

931
02:46:15,298 --> 02:46:17,323
l am just alive to listen to
your calling me as son.

932
02:46:20,270 --> 02:46:22,295
Please call me as son again

933
02:46:27,277 --> 02:46:32,476
l have met you after so long.
Don't leave me alone now.

934
02:46:40,323 --> 02:46:43,349
Our arrival & departures
are dependant on His will.

935
02:47:58,334 --> 02:48:00,461
Congratulations! Your son's
life is now out of danger.

936
02:48:04,340 --> 02:48:07,309
''Thank you so much, Lord!''

937
02:48:13,383 --> 02:48:16,375
Long Live lqbal Bhai!

938
02:48:24,494 --> 02:48:27,486
...brought me back to life again.
