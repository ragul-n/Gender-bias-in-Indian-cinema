1
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:44,759
Ram, today is your father's
15th death anniversary.

2
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:53,336
Ever since he died, I have
been managing his businesses.

3
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:56,411
Some opportunistic mill workers
are trying to use...

4
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:59,309
The opportunity of your father's
death anniversary...

5
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,051
To raise afresh demands which
I have already rejected.

6
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:04,845
They wish to make a presentation
before you.

7
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,818
They don't believe that
you are a retard...

8
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:14,064
That you can neither think
nor decide for yourself.

9
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:17,559
These morons think that you
can solve their problems.

10
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,503
That's why they have invited you
to the party this evening.

11
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:27,974
But you won't attend the party.
You won't step out of the house.

12
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:29,145
Understand?

13
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:35,009
Get me clear. It won't be good
if Ram steps out of the house.

14
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:41,347
Why won't we go?
Of course we will!

15
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:45,458
The accountant said his daughter
is going to dance at the party.

16
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:50,859
You'll take me, won't you?
- Your father will get angry!

17
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:54,661
Right, sister?
- Your Uncle is right.

18
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:59,274
We won't make it public.
We'll go there on the sly.

19
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:33,997
"Strange are the customs here..."

20
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:57,133
"For the honest, life is difficult"

21
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:02,931
"The dishonest thrive"

22
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:10,878
"Hush! Someone might hear"

23
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:23,892
"Hush! Someone might hear"

24
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,027
"if you are heard..."

25
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,131
"the soldiers will tie you up..."

26
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:37,706
"and they will take me away, my love"

27
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:45,380
"Hush! Someone might hear"

28
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:47,414
"Hush!"

29
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:21,581
"Alas, I must tell you of life here"

30
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:26,289
"Right is might, in every lane.
And downright thievery"

31
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:29,092
" Downright thievery"

32
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:34,263
"But for love's sake,
I'll protect you"

33
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:38,993
"Don't go around alone,
take my hand"

34
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:44,366
"Come on lass, take my hand"

35
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:52,145
"Why are you so eager?"

36
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:58,049
"There's trouble on the streets"

37
00:07:58,344 --> 00:08:00,915
"if a thief gets to hear..."

38
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:06,720
"he'll snatch your ring
from my fingers"

39
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:11,934
"My love"

40
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:17,608
"Hush!"

41
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:22,140
"Someone might hear"

42
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:24,177
"Hush!"

43
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:53,071
"The rich of this world
are so deceitful"

44
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:55,744
"So deceitful"

45
00:08:56,035 --> 00:09:02,953
"They will make you suffer,
they will rob you"

46
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:08,450
"What they say is true..."

47
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:13,163
"You got to bribe your way through"

48
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:18,358
"Got to bribe your way through"

49
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:23,632
"if you think that's amusing..."

50
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,876
"You think that's amusing?"

51
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:31,807
"I'm scared"

52
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,108
"if someone hears you..."

53
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:40,483
"you will be fined"

54
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:45,559
"My love..."

55
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:55,236
"hush! Someone might hear"

56
00:10:36,835 --> 00:10:38,178
Please come on the stage.

57
00:10:44,676 --> 00:10:50,786
Friends, today we are gathered
on the occasion of...

58
00:10:51,082 --> 00:10:53,528
The 15th death anniversary
of Raja Yeshwantrao Rane.

59
00:10:53,885 --> 00:11:02,100
We wanted to felicitate his son
Ramchandra, the owner of the mill.

60
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:07,671
But we have been told that
he is unwell. In his stead...

61
00:11:07,999 --> 00:11:13,381
I pray to Gajendra Babu
on behalf of the workers...

62
00:11:13,705 --> 00:11:19,747
To pay heed to our woes and
to help us in times of distress.

63
00:11:20,111 --> 00:11:22,785
On behalf of the workers,
I give him this petition.

64
00:11:23,014 --> 00:11:29,021
I ask him to say
a few words of assurance.

65
00:11:44,869 --> 00:11:49,614
Let's go now!
- Wait! Let's see what happens!

66
00:11:49,941 --> 00:11:52,649
That's the owner!

67
00:11:53,011 --> 00:11:54,888
He's here!

68
00:12:04,155 --> 00:12:09,503
Thank you for coming here, sir!
Please accept this garland.

69
00:12:11,763 --> 00:12:19,511
Long live Ramchandra!

70
00:12:19,737 --> 00:12:22,137
Down with Gajendra Patil!

71
00:12:44,862 --> 00:12:47,103
Sister! Hide me somewhere!
I've made a serious mistake!

72
00:12:47,365 --> 00:12:48,139
What happened?

73
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:09,497
What has happened?
- That which shouldn't have!

74
00:13:10,088 --> 00:13:16,403
Ramchandra insulted Gajendra Babu.
Gajendra Babu is very angry now!

75
00:13:16,794 --> 00:13:23,973
All you do is add fuel to fire!
- May my tongue rot if I'm lying!

76
00:13:24,302 --> 00:13:29,183
The laborers were screaming:
"Down with Gajendra Patil"

77
00:13:56,634 --> 00:14:00,047
No! Don't hit him!
- Out of my way!

78
00:14:03,675 --> 00:14:07,987
How dare he disobey me?!
I'll flay him alive!

79
00:14:08,379 --> 00:14:14,125
Daddy! Please don't beat him!
I asked him to take me there.

80
00:14:16,487 --> 00:14:22,096
Don't beat my brother any more!
He just took her along.

81
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,034
He won't do it again.
Forgive him, please.

82
00:14:25,897 --> 00:14:27,467
He deserves it!

83
00:14:27,632 --> 00:14:33,605
Step out of this house without
my permission, and you're dead!

84
00:15:32,997 --> 00:15:42,577
Mummy... Daddy, I can't bear this
misery, this insult any longer!

85
00:15:44,709 --> 00:15:52,287
I don't want a life like this!
I'm coming to you!

86
00:16:13,137 --> 00:16:15,549
Leave me alone!

87
00:16:15,873 --> 00:16:19,753
What are you up to?!
- I'm an idiot!

88
00:16:20,011 --> 00:16:24,687
I've no right to live!
I'd rather be dead than...

89
00:16:24,949 --> 00:16:32,163
Be flogged like an animal!
- It was all because of me!

90
00:16:35,193 --> 00:16:40,871
If you leave us,
we'll kill ourselves!

91
00:16:41,065 --> 00:16:45,810
For heaven's sake! Don't say that!
- Without you, we'll die!

92
00:16:46,103 --> 00:16:48,276
Don't say that, dear!
- Then swear by her...

93
00:16:48,539 --> 00:16:50,917
Swear it by me, swear it
on our dead parents...

94
00:16:51,175 --> 00:16:53,883
That you will never
think of suicide!

95
00:16:56,581 --> 00:17:06,400
Say it! Say it, Uncle!
- Your Uncle doesn't love us!

96
00:17:06,624 --> 00:17:12,575
We'd rather kill ourselves!
- Don't say that. I swear it!

97
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:16,039
No matter how much
I am brutalized...

98
00:17:16,334 --> 00:17:17,904
I shall bear it
in silence!

99
00:17:24,475 --> 00:17:31,518
God! Is there no one who will
come to our rescue?

100
00:17:43,227 --> 00:17:45,833
Hey you, Shania... out!

101
00:17:50,134 --> 00:17:52,740
Just you wait. I'm coming.

102
00:18:06,751 --> 00:18:09,151
Go to hell!
May your tractor burn down!

103
00:19:09,747 --> 00:19:12,387
You dare throw stones at me?

104
00:19:12,783 --> 00:19:17,994
Don't you act smart.
You trampled upon my nursery!

105
00:19:18,255 --> 00:19:23,466
As if you planted gold!
- Shut up!

106
00:19:23,761 --> 00:19:26,708
One of these days, I'll get
you married to some old leper.

107
00:19:26,998 --> 00:19:30,377
Find yourself an old leper.
lt'd make a nice match.

108
00:19:30,635 --> 00:19:32,342
What did you say?

109
00:19:32,603 --> 00:19:34,082
Uncle!

110
00:19:34,338 --> 00:19:36,511
Go on! Scream some more!

111
00:19:41,545 --> 00:19:42,649
What's it?

112
00:19:42,947 --> 00:19:44,949
Hey Mr. Shyam!

113
00:19:45,182 --> 00:19:49,756
Why are you screaming?
- Your wife just eloped!

114
00:19:50,788 --> 00:19:52,699
You witch!

115
00:19:56,427 --> 00:20:00,204
You're always pulling her leg.
- One of these days...

116
00:20:00,498 --> 00:20:02,239
I'll cut off her head and
I'll bury her in the field.

117
00:20:02,433 --> 00:20:07,507
Later. As of now, there's
a film heroine waiting for you!

118
00:20:07,772 --> 00:20:12,448
What film heroine?
- The heroine of a film...

119
00:20:13,377 --> 00:20:15,186
Here...?!
- Yes!

120
00:20:15,479 --> 00:20:19,928
And I talked the director
into giving you a role.

121
00:20:20,484 --> 00:20:25,263
Their hero is absconding.
They don't have a hero now.

122
00:20:25,523 --> 00:20:28,299
So you dress up in his clothes,
you fight the goons...

123
00:20:28,592 --> 00:20:32,665
And in the end,
you get to save the heroine!

124
00:20:34,765 --> 00:20:36,870
Where's the shooting?
- Beside the pond.

125
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:46,019
Go on, hero!

126
00:21:32,223 --> 00:21:34,567
He's beating them up in right earnest!
- Let him do it!

127
00:21:34,892 --> 00:21:36,462
He's actually bashing them up!

128
00:21:46,403 --> 00:21:47,973
Bash them up!

129
00:22:10,528 --> 00:22:15,341
Oh it's you, director sahib!
Sorry, I didn't notice.

130
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:16,873
Did you like my job?

131
00:22:20,538 --> 00:22:27,080
Who told you to bash them up?
You've ruined my shooting!

132
00:22:30,848 --> 00:22:33,954
Hey, he's the director!
Why are you beating him?

133
00:22:34,285 --> 00:22:38,927
He has no right to scream at me!
- You expect him to worship you?

134
00:22:39,423 --> 00:22:42,768
You left your brains at home?
What do you think this is?

135
00:22:43,027 --> 00:22:45,667
A film? Or a wrestling match?
- He told me to bash them up!

136
00:22:45,863 --> 00:22:50,073
The dress, please.
- Why is this fellow screaming?

137
00:22:50,467 --> 00:22:53,778
Who wants your clothes?

138
00:22:56,073 --> 00:22:57,347
Look...

139
00:22:58,876 --> 00:23:00,981
You're a misfit for films.

140
00:23:06,116 --> 00:23:08,995
Who told you to start
fighting for real?

141
00:23:10,788 --> 00:23:18,502
Who knew they'd fall like ninepins?
- In films, it's shadowboxing.

142
00:23:19,697 --> 00:23:22,007
Mummy is here.
- Let her come!

143
00:23:25,236 --> 00:23:27,716
Good you came, Aunt.

144
00:23:29,673 --> 00:23:32,483
We were just talking about you.
- Sure.

145
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:38,351
Hovv's the pain in your knee?
I bought some tiger fat for you.

146
00:23:38,682 --> 00:23:41,060
Tiger fat? For my knee?

147
00:23:44,188 --> 00:23:49,035
And the cow dung for your face?
- Sorry, forgot it.

148
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:56,200
You'll make your father proud!
You'll make a clown out of my son!

149
00:24:00,204 --> 00:24:02,810
Give him a hiding!
- You...?

150
00:24:03,073 --> 00:24:05,212
You know what he tells me?
- What?

151
00:24:05,476 --> 00:24:09,185
He says, forget
plowing fields.

152
00:24:09,513 --> 00:24:11,720
Says, there's a film heroine
waiting for you!

153
00:24:12,016 --> 00:24:14,121
Afilm heroine!
- No!

154
00:24:14,385 --> 00:24:15,864
Did you say it, or didn't you?
-I did...?

155
00:24:27,498 --> 00:24:33,449
Why don't you ask him?
Is he a suckling baby?

156
00:24:33,737 --> 00:24:36,980
Why did he go along?
- I'm going to thrash you!

157
00:24:37,374 --> 00:24:44,053
Don't you touch her!
- She's always poking her nose...

158
00:24:45,849 --> 00:24:50,594
She's a lady! You're a Ioafer!
- She's a witch!

159
00:25:10,774 --> 00:25:13,084
You're always after me!
- You go in there!

160
00:25:13,377 --> 00:25:16,153
If you step out of here,
I'll break your leg!

161
00:25:16,747 --> 00:25:18,988
Scoundrel!

162
00:25:21,051 --> 00:25:25,591
I'll make sure you get over
this obsession with cinema!

163
00:25:26,023 --> 00:25:32,872
Ever seen the Meena-Kumari-act?
- Enjoy yourself!

164
00:25:33,197 --> 00:25:37,339
How are you, my love?
The lion has been caged!

165
00:25:39,403 --> 00:25:45,115
Still have it in you?
Scoundrel, take this!

166
00:25:48,846 --> 00:25:53,955
Go on. Shout yourself hoarse.
Bring the skies down.

167
00:26:02,726 --> 00:26:04,899
Shut up!

168
00:26:05,195 --> 00:26:07,641
Enough is enough, Mummy.
Open the door.

169
00:26:08,232 --> 00:26:14,911
I was to go to town to buy seeds.
My tractor is out of order.

170
00:26:23,113 --> 00:26:26,993
Mummy! Snake!

171
00:26:27,351 --> 00:26:29,388
Help! Snake!

172
00:26:32,089 --> 00:26:33,329
Help!

173
00:26:33,624 --> 00:26:35,365
Help!

174
00:26:37,494 --> 00:26:39,633
Where's the snake?!

175
00:26:42,533 --> 00:26:43,910
Scoundrel!

176
00:27:07,091 --> 00:27:13,337
I'm your doctor. I want to help.
All of us want to help.

177
00:27:13,464 --> 00:27:16,104
We want you to recover.
Your fears are baseless.

178
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,779
The fear was rooted in your mind
when you were a child.

179
00:27:20,204 --> 00:27:27,645
Try to recall. How did you begin
fearing your brother-in-law?

180
00:27:28,245 --> 00:27:31,886
If I say anything about him,
he will get angry...

181
00:27:32,149 --> 00:27:35,528
And he'll beat me up again.
- He won't tell you anything.

182
00:27:35,819 --> 00:27:40,859
Feel free to talk. Go on.

183
00:27:44,495 --> 00:27:47,806
It happened when I was a kid.

184
00:27:49,333 --> 00:27:56,581
Gajendra used to visit us
with his father.

185
00:27:56,907 --> 00:28:00,480
We were flying kites one day,
and Gajendra lost his kite.

186
00:28:00,811 --> 00:28:07,854
I started clapping and shouting
"Gajendra lost his kite"

187
00:28:08,018 --> 00:28:11,830
The servants joined in too.
And Gajendra went berserk.

188
00:28:12,356 --> 00:28:16,236
He picked up a stick,
and he began beating me.

189
00:28:16,493 --> 00:28:21,169
When he hit me I screamed,
but he hit me again and again.

190
00:28:21,398 --> 00:28:25,039
He drove me to the staircase,
and then he pushed me. I fell.

191
00:28:25,402 --> 00:28:28,349
I stayed unconscious
for several days.

192
00:28:33,577 --> 00:28:35,079
Ever since then...

193
00:28:35,579 --> 00:28:41,029
Whenever he looks at me
with anger in his eyes...

194
00:28:41,285 --> 00:28:45,700
Something comes over me.
I am petrified!

195
00:28:45,923 --> 00:28:49,598
I can do nothing,
I can say nothing...

196
00:28:49,826 --> 00:28:52,136
Oh I hate myself!

197
00:28:52,329 --> 00:28:54,570
I do nothing, I say nothing!

198
00:28:54,865 --> 00:29:00,838
I don't know what happens to me.
I didn't know...

199
00:29:05,842 --> 00:29:08,242
He's obsessed with fear.
it's the impact of brutality.

200
00:29:16,353 --> 00:29:20,893
Any cures?
- Take my advice.

201
00:29:21,124 --> 00:29:22,967
Get him married.
To a good girl.

202
00:29:25,062 --> 00:29:28,669
Given love and care,
he'll recover.

203
00:29:29,366 --> 00:29:36,284
Oh how I wish my brother would
get married and have children.

204
00:29:36,807 --> 00:29:40,812
But my husband might never
let him marry.

205
00:29:42,012 --> 00:29:44,856
Do you think your husband
is your brother's enemy?

206
00:29:45,182 --> 00:29:48,857
Why did you bring in the doctor
on the sly?

207
00:29:49,152 --> 00:29:52,565
I am concerned for Ramchandra.
I have chosen a girl for him.

208
00:29:52,856 --> 00:29:55,666
From a family of aristocrats.
And she's very beautiful.

209
00:29:55,959 --> 00:30:03,468
She brings a dowry of millions.
- Who are you talking about?

210
00:30:03,767 --> 00:30:08,682
Her father and yours were friends.
Gangadhar Rao's daughter, Anjana.

211
00:30:26,456 --> 00:30:29,562
Coming, Daddy.

212
00:30:30,827 --> 00:30:34,206
Look at you! You look shabby.

213
00:30:34,531 --> 00:30:36,943
Mr. Gajendra is coming
to see you.

214
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,975
Go on. Get dressed.

215
00:30:39,336 --> 00:30:43,614
You're presenting me to suitors
almost every day.

216
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:48,355
At this rate, my life is going to
become one endless fashion parade.

217
00:30:49,813 --> 00:30:54,558
Why aren't you wearing
any jewelry?

218
00:30:54,851 --> 00:30:57,331
Do I look ugly?

219
00:30:58,689 --> 00:31:01,829
To me, you are the prettiest.

220
00:31:02,626 --> 00:31:07,234
How I wish your mother was alive.

221
00:31:08,598 --> 00:31:15,208
Bless your daughter.
She's getting married.

222
00:31:16,606 --> 00:31:17,846
Must be them.

223
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:24,822
Welcome, Gajendra.

224
00:31:25,482 --> 00:31:30,261
Thakur Gajendra, the late
Yeshwantrads son-in-law.

225
00:31:30,554 --> 00:31:33,364
And he might be your
brother-in-law-to-be.

226
00:31:34,991 --> 00:31:37,301
You must've seen Anju
when she was a child.

227
00:31:37,794 --> 00:31:42,243
It's different now. Words aren't
enough to praise her beauty.

228
00:31:42,766 --> 00:31:45,440
Superb! Now be seated.

229
00:31:45,702 --> 00:31:48,876
How about a snack?

230
00:31:49,206 --> 00:31:52,744
Why take the trouble?
- But I have to.

231
00:31:53,143 --> 00:31:55,282
I am the girl's father.

232
00:31:55,979 --> 00:32:00,519
Marriages are best discussed
over a course of sweets.

233
00:32:00,851 --> 00:32:02,125
Let's sit down.

234
00:32:04,855 --> 00:32:10,771
Anju is my only child.
All my worries will be over...

235
00:32:11,128 --> 00:32:16,009
If I can find a good boy for her.
- Ram is no less worthy.

236
00:32:16,333 --> 00:32:19,212
Very polite, well-mannered
and of excellent character.

237
00:32:19,503 --> 00:32:21,574
Here's the photograph.

238
00:32:23,006 --> 00:32:25,043
Handsome.

239
00:32:25,742 --> 00:32:27,050
Would you like to see, Ms Anjana?

240
00:32:27,511 --> 00:32:32,256
Think it over before you decide.
We don't want fireworks later.

241
00:32:32,916 --> 00:32:41,392
Can you tell a man's nature from
a photograph? Why didn't he come?

242
00:32:41,625 --> 00:32:46,131
She has a point. Answer, please.
Why hasn't he come?

243
00:32:46,463 --> 00:32:50,138
Wasn't necessary. Ram can never
object to what I decide.

244
00:32:51,368 --> 00:32:55,839
He seems to be obedient?
- Might be.

245
00:32:56,306 --> 00:33:02,882
But Daddy, wouldn't it be better
if we met each other?

246
00:33:05,081 --> 00:33:13,501
Better let boy and girl assess
each other before they decide.

247
00:33:13,824 --> 00:33:18,637
I assure you, Ram will never
give you a chance to complain.

248
00:33:18,929 --> 00:33:23,400
He's very cool-headed.
- The question doesn't arise.

249
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:28,911
That means we have your consent?
- Now I didn't say that.

250
00:33:31,875 --> 00:33:37,723
My daughter prefers plain speak.
And she makes her point.

251
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:41,222
Gajendra, you and I
have no more say.

252
00:33:41,718 --> 00:33:45,222
We' re going to our farmhouse
on Sunday, aren't we?

253
00:33:45,589 --> 00:33:50,095
If you say so, we could drop by.
Let boy and girl meet.

254
00:33:53,563 --> 00:33:58,205
No problem. But before that,
the dowry and settlements...

255
00:33:58,468 --> 00:34:02,814
Must be sorted out.
- Whatever I have is hers.

256
00:34:03,106 --> 00:34:07,714
But her choice that comes first.
Anything else, I'm game.

257
00:34:08,712 --> 00:34:14,025
From what you say, she seems
to be a spirited one.

258
00:34:14,351 --> 00:34:22,361
Yes. But she's very beautiful.
And worth millions in dowry.

259
00:34:22,959 --> 00:34:27,533
Don't you worry, Mummy.
You son thinks before he acts.

260
00:34:27,864 --> 00:34:30,242
Mr. Rao and his daughter
have arrived.

261
00:34:30,867 --> 00:34:34,872
Get Ram dressed, and
bring him downstairs.

262
00:34:36,439 --> 00:34:38,885
Welcome, Mr. Rao.

263
00:34:40,944 --> 00:34:43,948
We' re fortunate to have you
as a guest in our house.

264
00:34:44,247 --> 00:34:46,557
House? This is a palace!

265
00:34:47,517 --> 00:34:51,260
This is Mr. Gangadhar.
And his daughter.

266
00:34:51,655 --> 00:34:53,362
And she is...?
- My mother.

267
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:54,794
Your mother?

268
00:34:56,726 --> 00:34:58,603
Greetings!

269
00:34:59,863 --> 00:35:05,313
You were the son-in-law who
moved in with his father-in-law.

270
00:35:05,602 --> 00:35:09,914
But I didn't know...
your mother has moved in too?

271
00:35:12,275 --> 00:35:14,084
Is that so amusing?

272
00:35:17,714 --> 00:35:20,854
No offence meant...

273
00:35:21,184 --> 00:35:24,028
To daughters-in-law who move in
with their mothers-in-law...

274
00:35:24,354 --> 00:35:27,130
Or vice versa...?

275
00:35:29,159 --> 00:35:32,470
I'm not going downstairs!
They'll make fun of me.

276
00:35:32,796 --> 00:35:35,299
They dare not!

277
00:35:36,066 --> 00:35:41,778
God willing, she might
take a liking for you.

278
00:35:42,138 --> 00:35:50,284
No one will like me! I know it!
I can't even talk properly.

279
00:35:50,547 --> 00:35:53,551
And she's educated.
- So what?

280
00:35:59,823 --> 00:36:08,971
Here comes the feast.
Anjana, you're being feted.

281
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:15,982
After the wedding, she'll become
the toast of the household!

282
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:18,685
Who asked you to speak?

283
00:36:18,942 --> 00:36:21,286
Forgive me.

284
00:36:21,845 --> 00:36:26,316
Why do you insist on seeing Ram
before the wedding?

285
00:36:26,983 --> 00:36:31,955
Why not? This concerns my life.
I won't take a blind decision.

286
00:36:32,288 --> 00:36:34,894
Quite contrary to tradition.

287
00:36:35,225 --> 00:36:38,968
You think we'd hitch you
to a cripple or something?

288
00:36:39,295 --> 00:36:42,970
Could be a possibility too.
Rather than repent later...

289
00:36:43,333 --> 00:36:47,440
It's better to get to know
each other. Right, Daddy?

290
00:36:49,506 --> 00:36:55,923
Gone are the days when girls
were given away into slavery.

291
00:36:56,212 --> 00:37:01,389
This is the new age.
Getting cross won't help.

292
00:37:03,787 --> 00:37:07,963
Your tea is getting cold.
- I'd rather wait for Ram.

293
00:37:08,358 --> 00:37:09,632
Here he is.

294
00:37:09,926 --> 00:37:11,166
Come on, Ram.
- Come, Uncle.

295
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:22,443
Come here, Ram.

296
00:37:37,387 --> 00:37:42,632
He's so simple, so docile...
not like the boys these days.

297
00:37:48,231 --> 00:37:50,040
Be seated, sir.

298
00:37:50,633 --> 00:37:52,169
Sit down, Ram.

299
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:28,480
Why, they are so silent.
Why don't you talk?

300
00:38:30,673 --> 00:38:34,587
How far have you studied?

301
00:38:36,513 --> 00:38:40,188
What need education for
ones who are wealthy?

302
00:38:40,416 --> 00:38:43,556
Mr. Ram isn't about to go
asking for a job, is he?

303
00:38:44,754 --> 00:38:49,066
Your tea is getting cold.
- Yes, let's have tea.

304
00:38:51,327 --> 00:38:54,706
How much sugar?

305
00:38:56,866 --> 00:38:59,938
Uncle doesn't drink tea.
He drinks milk.

306
00:39:03,573 --> 00:39:08,784
Such a simpleton...
give him a cup of milk.

307
00:39:38,208 --> 00:39:39,152
Drink it up, Ram.

308
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:08,271
Don't go away like this!
You don't know my brother yet.

309
00:40:08,605 --> 00:40:11,677
He's a beautiful person.
If he marries someone like you...

310
00:40:11,975 --> 00:40:15,548
He will change. For the better.
- As of now, I must leave.

311
00:40:15,979 --> 00:40:21,861
If he gets someone like you,
his life will be changed.

312
00:40:22,218 --> 00:40:26,223
We'll give you everything...
the house, all this wealth...

313
00:40:26,589 --> 00:40:30,332
And we'll go away from here.
- What do you mean?

314
00:40:30,693 --> 00:40:37,167
Ram is going to inherit
all this wealth.

315
00:40:37,634 --> 00:40:44,210
Say yes, please!
- Please do not embarrass me.

316
00:40:44,574 --> 00:40:47,453
I cannot say anything now.
Shall we, Daddy?

317
00:40:49,412 --> 00:40:55,385
Anjana is just a bit nervous.
But we'll be back again.

318
00:40:55,718 --> 00:40:57,994
Come dear.

319
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:09,433
The sister loves her brother!
She gives up everything!

320
00:41:10,033 --> 00:41:12,070
Once I'm gone,
will he be able...

321
00:41:12,235 --> 00:41:13,771
To manage this business
for even a day?

322
00:41:18,308 --> 00:41:20,618
Accepted that he has
a good character...

323
00:41:20,877 --> 00:41:22,117
Accepted that he comes
from a good family.

324
00:41:22,378 --> 00:41:26,758
But if you ask me to marry him,
I'll say no thank you!

325
00:41:27,583 --> 00:41:32,999
The way he stared at me!
I became apprehensive.

326
00:41:33,389 --> 00:41:34,959
I felt pity for him.
- The straight types...

327
00:41:35,191 --> 00:41:36,795
Lose their nerves when
it comes to this.

328
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:40,371
But you didn't notice something.
- For someone...

329
00:41:40,697 --> 00:41:42,734
Who is a sole heir
to such a large fortune...

330
00:41:42,999 --> 00:41:48,881
The boy is very timid.
- Is being timid a plus point?

331
00:41:49,172 --> 00:41:54,087
He would do whatever you tell him.
Tell him sit, and he will sit;

332
00:41:54,344 --> 00:41:55,914
say stand up, and he'll stand up.
- That's what we'd end up doing...

333
00:41:56,145 --> 00:41:57,954
For the rest of our lives
 sit-downs and stand-ups!

334
00:41:59,682 --> 00:42:02,390
For a marriage to work,
a boy and a girl should have...

335
00:42:02,585 --> 00:42:04,360
At least something in common.
- True...

336
00:42:05,188 --> 00:42:09,500
He is a nerd! I wonder what
kind of conversation we'd make.

337
00:42:09,792 --> 00:42:13,467
Conversation could be a problem!
But there's no hurry.

338
00:42:13,796 --> 00:42:16,538
Think it over.
-I have thought it over.

339
00:42:23,873 --> 00:42:29,380
About the late Yeshwantrads will
 when does my authority...

340
00:42:29,645 --> 00:42:31,022
Over the businesses
and the estates end?

341
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,887
31 st March next. All properties
will be handed over to Ram.

342
00:42:36,819 --> 00:42:40,062
Get the lawyers to draft
a document...

343
00:42:40,356 --> 00:42:44,065
To ensure that all control over
Ram's businesses and estates...

344
00:42:44,427 --> 00:42:47,431
Is ceded to me till perpetuity.
- Will Ram sign such a document?

345
00:42:48,097 --> 00:42:50,839
His sister, you know...
- Neither brother nor sister...

346
00:42:51,134 --> 00:42:57,949
Never had the guts to oppose me.
If Ram resists, I'll use a whip.

347
00:43:00,443 --> 00:43:01,888
You may leave.

348
00:43:06,849 --> 00:43:10,524
If he gets wind of this,
he might become stubborn.

349
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:17,701
Why doesn't he just drop dead?
- He'll die. Of course he will.

350
00:43:18,094 --> 00:43:25,842
After he has signed the papers.
He's a thorn in my side!

351
00:43:26,402 --> 00:43:29,440
After I've had him
to sign the papers...

352
00:43:29,672 --> 00:43:31,083
I'll eliminate him.

353
00:43:31,407 --> 00:43:33,807
He'll die. Of course he will.

354
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:53,466
After I've had him
to sign the papers.

355
00:43:53,563 --> 00:43:55,406
He'll die. Of course he will.

356
00:43:55,698 --> 00:43:58,406
After I've had him
to sign the papers.

357
00:43:59,368 --> 00:44:04,579
Sit down! Here's the pen. Sign!

358
00:44:05,174 --> 00:44:11,090
Afterwards, you'll kill me...?
- Sign it! Now!

359
00:45:19,415 --> 00:45:23,488
What's on the menu?
- Mutton and chicken...

360
00:45:23,686 --> 00:45:27,361
Curried, roasted,
chops, and in biryani.

361
00:45:27,490 --> 00:45:29,163
And eggs, curried and in masala.
What will it be, sir?

362
00:45:29,425 --> 00:45:32,702
2 plates each.
- 2 plates sir? Of each?

363
00:45:33,196 --> 00:45:35,198
Mutton and chicken curried
roasted, chops, and in biryani...

364
00:45:35,398 --> 00:45:37,639
And eggs curried and
also in masala?!

365
00:45:37,867 --> 00:45:40,108
2 of each.
- Hey Abdul!

366
00:45:41,270 --> 00:45:44,114
And the goat's...
- Brains...?

367
00:45:44,507 --> 00:45:47,113
2 of that too?
Hey Abdul!

368
00:46:10,499 --> 00:46:15,812
Anything else, sir?
- Let me finish this first.

369
00:46:16,038 --> 00:46:17,813
Then we'll see.
- Then...?! Hey Abdul!

370
00:46:29,485 --> 00:46:31,021
Your check, sir?

371
00:46:33,456 --> 00:46:37,404
Anything else?
- Nothing. The kitchen is empty.

372
00:46:37,994 --> 00:46:41,965
Two mouth-fresheners, please.
- Available outside, please.

373
00:46:42,231 --> 00:46:45,872
Hey Abdul, the check.

374
00:47:18,534 --> 00:47:20,241
Your check. The money, please.

375
00:47:21,537 --> 00:47:21,878
What are you staring at?

376
00:47:22,138 --> 00:47:23,310
Out with the money.

377
00:47:24,206 --> 00:47:28,382
I'll pay, after I eat something.
- Haven't you had your fill?!

378
00:47:28,678 --> 00:47:31,750
What more do you want?!
- I haven't eaten yet.

379
00:47:32,114 --> 00:47:35,152
May I get some rice and dal?
I'm hungry.

380
00:47:35,484 --> 00:47:37,862
You've emptied the bloody kitchen!
And you still want dal and rice?

381
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:40,623
Wait! Let me put some
salt and pepper on me...

382
00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:44,394
And then you can eat me!
- Not you?

383
00:47:44,694 --> 00:47:49,541
All right, may I have some tea?
- How many dozen cups?

384
00:47:50,032 --> 00:47:52,774
Only one cup.
- Just one? Thank you.

385
00:47:53,069 --> 00:47:54,810
Tea over here.

386
00:47:55,304 --> 00:47:58,444
Here you are... now out with
the money.

387
00:47:59,442 --> 00:48:01,615
24.75

388
00:48:03,979 --> 00:48:08,325
The money!
- So much for one cup of tea?

389
00:48:08,584 --> 00:48:14,899
Who pays for what you ate?
-I didn't eat all this...

390
00:48:15,157 --> 00:48:17,228
I can swear it by my mother!
- No, you don't...?

391
00:48:17,493 --> 00:48:20,736
You are a conman!
-I haven't eaten!

392
00:48:20,996 --> 00:48:22,805
Hey Abdul! Hey manager!
Come over here.

393
00:48:22,998 --> 00:48:26,377
He ate all that, and now he says
he hasn't eaten anything!

394
00:48:26,602 --> 00:48:28,604
Frisk him.
-I haven't eaten!

395
00:48:28,871 --> 00:48:31,010
He polished off all this!
Now he says he hasn't eaten!

396
00:48:31,307 --> 00:48:35,517
The money! Or the police?
- Search his wallet.

397
00:48:35,878 --> 00:48:42,454
No! I didn't eat that!
- Only 20. 4.75 short!

398
00:48:42,852 --> 00:48:46,231
Who pays the rest?
- Forgive me, may I have my tea?

399
00:48:46,555 --> 00:48:49,798
Forgive you? After all you ate?
- Take his jacket, and throw him out!

400
00:48:50,292 --> 00:48:54,206
Take that off!
- But my tea...

401
00:48:54,497 --> 00:48:57,671
May I have my tea?
- Get out!

402
00:49:08,577 --> 00:49:10,420
What do you want?
Get out of my way.

403
00:49:13,082 --> 00:49:15,585
My purse! Thief!

404
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:40,020
Hey Shyam...
- You? Here?

405
00:50:04,166 --> 00:50:05,509
Cut the hysterics.

406
00:50:05,901 --> 00:50:08,040
Where's your car? Over there?

407
00:50:08,971 --> 00:50:09,847
Listen...

408
00:50:19,648 --> 00:50:22,288
Come in, come in please.

409
00:50:26,722 --> 00:50:28,099
Please take the stuff
from the gentleman.

410
00:50:31,327 --> 00:50:33,432
Is Daddy's luggage packed?
- Yes.

411
00:50:33,696 --> 00:50:35,039
Where is he?
- Upstairs.

412
00:50:35,831 --> 00:50:37,708
Please be seated.
I'll join you in a moment.

413
00:50:53,415 --> 00:50:56,919
What is it?
- What are you doing in my room?

414
00:50:57,186 --> 00:51:03,569
Caught you. My book is here.
- Forget it. Guess what happened?

415
00:51:03,759 --> 00:51:08,902
What happened?
- Ram turns out to be Tarzan!

416
00:51:09,131 --> 00:51:11,873
And I thought he's an idiot.
He had us fooled!

417
00:51:12,134 --> 00:51:16,879
How come?
- Some Ioafers accosted me.

418
00:51:17,106 --> 00:51:20,246
One even snatched my purse.
- Really?

419
00:51:20,409 --> 00:51:27,122
Yes! And here comes Ramchandra,
and he bashes them up!

420
00:51:27,383 --> 00:51:35,461
He fixed them up proper!
They scrambled!

421
00:51:35,891 --> 00:51:40,931
Remember, I said he's a nice boy?
He was just nervous the other day.

422
00:51:42,264 --> 00:51:44,437
Come, you must meet him.
- He's here?

423
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:47,647
Yes. I brought him along.
- Before that...

424
00:51:47,937 --> 00:51:50,383
We must come to an understanding.
- Understanding?

425
00:51:50,573 --> 00:51:55,181
Yes. You like the boy?
- Of course, he's a nice fellow.

426
00:51:55,444 --> 00:51:59,085
Will you marry him?
- What do you mean?

427
00:51:59,381 --> 00:52:02,385
If you like him, you marry him.
Makes sense for me to meet him.

428
00:52:02,685 --> 00:52:05,757
I haven't the time for
every tom and dick.

429
00:52:10,626 --> 00:52:14,073
That won't work.
I want a straight answer.

430
00:52:19,301 --> 00:52:20,575
Yes or no?

431
00:52:22,938 --> 00:52:29,321
Yes, but you won't tell him
what I said about him, please?

432
00:52:29,612 --> 00:52:32,024
Okay, I won't. Come on.

433
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:00,587
Here you are in town,
and we don't even know!

434
00:53:00,876 --> 00:53:03,254
At least you could've telephoned.
- Telephoned...?

435
00:53:35,344 --> 00:53:35,685
The other day at tea...
that was a neat act.

436
00:53:35,978 --> 00:53:37,685
When was this?
- The other day!

437
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:41,860
Oh, the other day at tea?
An act is an act after all.

438
00:53:42,151 --> 00:53:49,330
Today was dramatic too.
- You do put in a good act.

439
00:53:49,591 --> 00:53:52,595
I have the flair for it.
Drama, tragedy, comedy.

440
00:53:52,928 --> 00:53:55,738
How I wish I could play
around these roles.

441
00:53:56,031 --> 00:53:58,375
But there's no one
to give me a chance.

442
00:54:00,202 --> 00:54:05,550
Don't I say that things
isn't what they seem?

443
00:54:05,774 --> 00:54:09,415
So the most unseeingly of them
must be true!

444
00:54:09,712 --> 00:54:14,161
Point! Kabir the seer,
said that too.

445
00:54:14,550 --> 00:54:20,262
"Black is colored, and
White is called pale"

446
00:54:20,789 --> 00:54:22,393
There was something else
in the verse... I forget.

447
00:54:22,658 --> 00:54:24,501
Then its:
"That's why Kabir weeps"

448
00:54:25,194 --> 00:54:28,437
Hear that? Sparkling conversation!

449
00:54:28,797 --> 00:54:33,974
And you wondered what kind
of conversation you'd have.

450
00:54:34,236 --> 00:54:36,614
Brilliant sense of humor!

451
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:41,185
You're here in the nick of time.
We' re taking the evening flight...

452
00:54:41,443 --> 00:54:45,152
To Kodaikanal. You're coming.
- How could I come...?

453
00:54:45,414 --> 00:54:49,385
The way you came here.
- What'd folks at home say?

454
00:54:49,651 --> 00:54:51,562
Besides, I haven't spare clothes.
- You will be taken care of.

455
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:53,993
No buts.
Say what, dear?

456
00:54:54,223 --> 00:54:55,964
Right. Now go and take a bath.

457
00:54:56,892 --> 00:54:59,771
What?
- Take a bath. Hurry up.

458
00:55:00,629 --> 00:55:07,478
Is that necessary?
- That's strange of you!

459
00:55:07,803 --> 00:55:11,751
If a lady told me that,
I'd throw myself into a well!

460
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:14,179
If she wants you to take a bath,
you take a bath.

461
00:55:14,510 --> 00:55:16,683
What's this discussion all about?
- I'll take the bath.

462
00:55:18,213 --> 00:55:23,424
Whimpering gets you nowhere.
All you want are bonuses, loans!

463
00:55:23,752 --> 00:55:26,232
Someone's mother dies!
Someone's sister falls sick!

464
00:55:26,588 --> 00:55:28,864
What do you think I am?
A financier for your woes?!

465
00:55:29,124 --> 00:55:31,070
No one gets anything!
Get out of here!

466
00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:38,907
You did the right thing
telling them off.

467
00:55:39,201 --> 00:55:43,343
There's no sign of Mr. Ram yet,
and these people...

468
00:55:43,739 --> 00:55:45,616
Any news from the people
who are looking for Ram?

469
00:55:45,908 --> 00:55:49,515
They have combed the whole city.
But there's no news of Mr. Ram.

470
00:55:50,179 --> 00:55:54,855
He might have had enough
of getting whipped.

471
00:55:55,150 --> 00:55:58,597
I fear he might've decided
to drown himself.

472
00:56:00,055 --> 00:56:02,797
Not dead yet.

473
00:56:03,125 --> 00:56:04,399
Mr. Rao's writes.
The moron is visiting his girl!

474
00:56:04,793 --> 00:56:07,967
He has taken that idiot away
to some hill station.

475
00:56:09,598 --> 00:56:18,348
"I'm doomed to die for love"

476
00:56:18,607 --> 00:56:21,986
"No one can help me now"

477
00:56:42,764 --> 00:56:46,268
Stop it!

478
00:56:54,610 --> 00:57:01,289
You've drenched me!
- Forgive me, I didn't notice.

479
00:57:07,489 --> 00:57:12,461
What are you doing out
in the morning chill?

480
00:57:13,262 --> 00:57:18,302
You're lucky I took this walk.
Wait, I'll show you.

481
00:57:20,903 --> 00:57:24,680
Your trees are infested
with worms.

482
00:57:25,374 --> 00:57:28,014
Worms?
- Look at these white mounds.

483
00:57:32,347 --> 00:57:37,626
Had I not sprayed the insecticide,
your garden would be destroyed.

484
00:57:38,620 --> 00:57:42,124
So you also know
everything about gardening?

485
00:57:42,391 --> 00:57:44,837
Only about gardening.

486
00:57:46,929 --> 00:57:50,274
That reminds me of something.
- What?

487
00:57:52,734 --> 00:57:55,476
In the beginning, I thought
this is some big joke.

488
00:57:55,904 --> 00:57:59,317
But this is becoming serious.
- What do you mean to say?

489
00:57:59,708 --> 00:58:05,624
Suppose you were told that
I'm a cheapskate...

490
00:58:05,847 --> 00:58:08,555
That I don't own those factories
and mills and all that wealth?

491
00:58:11,219 --> 00:58:15,827
What if you were to come to know
that I'm not what you think I am?

492
00:58:16,224 --> 00:58:21,003
Oh I know all that. You aren't
what I presumed you to be.

493
00:58:22,965 --> 00:58:26,037
The one who was trembling
the other day...

494
00:58:26,635 --> 00:58:30,412
Turns out to be the one
who bashed up those guys.

495
00:58:30,639 --> 00:58:35,987
Look, I think some stories
are getting mixed up.

496
00:58:36,244 --> 00:58:41,922
If this is getting mixed-up,
then I like the mess.

497
00:58:44,853 --> 00:58:47,129
Breakfast ready!

498
00:58:47,889 --> 00:58:54,773
A cup of tea?
- No. This is trouble.

499
00:58:55,097 --> 00:58:59,807
Trouble? What?
- You won't believe this.

500
00:59:00,469 --> 00:59:03,780
Tea intoxicates me.

501
00:59:04,639 --> 00:59:08,109
I feel tipsy.
- Tipsy?

502
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:15,624
Tea isn't an intoxicant.
- It makes me tipsy.

503
00:59:15,884 --> 00:59:18,694
No more acting. And remember
what Daddy said.

504
00:59:19,087 --> 00:59:21,033
When a girl tells you
to have tea...

505
00:59:21,289 --> 00:59:23,667
You have the tea,
come what may.

506
00:59:23,992 --> 00:59:27,098
Have it.
- You're forcing me.

507
00:59:27,362 --> 00:59:29,569
I won't be held responsible
for this.

508
00:59:39,408 --> 00:59:40,512
Please, may I have some more?

509
00:59:40,909 --> 00:59:41,910
Some more?

510
00:59:42,177 --> 00:59:44,054
Sure.

511
01:00:22,784 --> 01:00:28,325
"I'm your muse,
you're a drunk"

512
01:00:28,390 --> 01:00:33,703
"I'm your muse,
you're a drunk"

513
01:00:33,995 --> 01:00:38,944
"Am I drunken in the ecstasy in your
eyes? Or are you entreating me?"

514
01:00:39,367 --> 01:00:47,047
"My heart blossoms"

515
01:00:47,342 --> 01:00:52,758
"I'm your muse,
you're a drunk"

516
01:00:53,014 --> 01:00:58,225
"I'm your muse,
you're a drunk"

517
01:01:14,636 --> 01:01:20,109
"Careful, lest your cup brimmeth over"

518
01:01:20,275 --> 01:01:28,558
"In your wayward eyes,
is there a dream for tomorrow?"

519
01:01:33,788 --> 01:01:39,170
"I'm drawn to you
in drunken ecstasy"

520
01:01:39,427 --> 01:01:47,573
"l wish I live the rest
of my life in ecstasy"

521
01:01:50,071 --> 01:01:58,149
"if love is what you seek..."

522
01:01:58,413 --> 01:02:03,726
"all I can give you is my youth"

523
01:02:03,985 --> 01:02:08,991
"You are my muse,
and I'm drunk"

524
01:02:09,291 --> 01:02:14,639
"You are my muse,
and I'm drunk"

525
01:02:33,648 --> 01:02:39,121
"l came into your world,
and I forgot myself"

526
01:02:39,421 --> 01:02:43,335
"l don't care for consequences"

527
01:02:43,592 --> 01:02:46,801
"I've lost my senses"

528
01:02:47,362 --> 01:02:52,869
"Is this song of love
to be sung forever?"

529
01:02:53,068 --> 01:02:59,781
"Will love blossom?
Our times are come"

530
01:03:00,809 --> 01:03:03,209
"You say you want to have fun?
No, don't corrupt me"

531
01:03:14,589 --> 01:03:19,902
"I'm your muse,
you're my drunk"

532
01:03:20,161 --> 01:03:24,940
"Am I drunken in the ecstasy in your
eyes? Or are you entreating me?"

533
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:33,119
"My heart blossoms"

534
01:03:33,308 --> 01:03:38,417
"I'm your muse,
you're my drunk"

535
01:03:38,546 --> 01:03:44,087
"I'm your muse,
you're my drunk"

536
01:04:26,124 --> 01:04:31,267
My respects to a man of religion.
- May fortune be yours.

537
01:04:39,270 --> 01:04:42,911
Is this out of some film
you've just seen?

538
01:04:43,408 --> 01:04:45,808
This scripture was written
by Tulsidas, the poet.

539
01:04:48,746 --> 01:04:49,656
Go on, please.

540
01:04:50,014 --> 01:04:51,459
Go on.

541
01:04:55,453 --> 01:04:59,094
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
Your mother is dying to see you!

542
01:04:59,390 --> 01:05:03,770
Been years since my mother died!
- How could you say that?!

543
01:05:04,095 --> 01:05:08,407
Hey folks! Come over here!
Look what Shyam is up to!

544
01:05:10,001 --> 01:05:12,481
Hurry up! Come here!

545
01:05:15,607 --> 01:05:17,211
He's running away!

546
01:05:31,456 --> 01:05:34,699
Get him!
- Catch him!

547
01:05:36,828 --> 01:05:38,432
No! Please! Don't do this!
Leave me!

548
01:05:39,230 --> 01:05:42,700
Don't you try to run away again!
- I won't! Ever!

549
01:05:42,934 --> 01:05:47,349
I'll inform his mother.
- No! Let me go!

550
01:05:47,972 --> 01:05:52,352
But I'm not Shyam!

551
01:05:56,281 --> 01:05:57,624
What happened, Shanta?

552
01:05:57,849 --> 01:06:00,193
Come and see, your Shyam is back.

553
01:06:01,119 --> 01:06:02,655
Shyam? Back?

554
01:06:02,887 --> 01:06:05,731
Hurry up.
- I'm coming!

555
01:06:15,233 --> 01:06:19,807
Shyam! My darling!
You left me all alone!

556
01:06:20,571 --> 01:06:27,181
What kind of a dress is this?
- I've joined a monastic order.

557
01:06:27,412 --> 01:06:34,193
We were on our way on pilgrimage.
Your men abducted me!

558
01:06:34,452 --> 01:06:39,458
Please! Let me go!
- Darling! What's it with you?

559
01:06:39,590 --> 01:06:41,900
You're my Shyam aren't you?
- No!

560
01:06:42,694 --> 01:06:47,973
He's putting on! One tight slap
will bring him around.

561
01:06:50,234 --> 01:06:53,807
Why should I put up any act?

562
01:06:54,339 --> 01:06:59,516
Son, am I not your mother?
- No! I have no mother!

563
01:07:01,579 --> 01:07:05,493
My mother is dead!
I have no mother!

564
01:07:05,783 --> 01:07:08,559
What's come over you,
my darling?

565
01:07:09,087 --> 01:07:12,330
Look at me, darling.
I'm your mother, am I not?

566
01:07:12,590 --> 01:07:15,503
No!
- Oh my God!

567
01:07:15,693 --> 01:07:19,664
My mother is dead.
- You want your mother dead?!

568
01:07:21,966 --> 01:07:26,437
No, don't scold my baby!
He must be under an evil spell!

569
01:07:26,804 --> 01:07:30,616
Don't you worry!
I'll call the witch doctor!

570
01:07:30,908 --> 01:07:35,653
He will exorcise the ghost!
- No! Don't do that!

571
01:07:36,147 --> 01:07:39,720
No! Not the witch doctor!

572
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:45,460
Look at me! I'm your mother!
- No!

573
01:07:47,024 --> 01:07:54,408
Goddess of Spirits!
Drive the ghost out!

574
01:07:54,632 --> 01:07:58,546
Cure Ganga's son!

575
01:07:59,504 --> 01:08:02,542
Speak up!
Who are you?

576
01:08:02,807 --> 01:08:07,415
A novice. In a monastic order.
- Not again!

577
01:08:08,379 --> 01:08:09,983
You're Shyam! Say it!

578
01:08:11,749 --> 01:08:14,753
That is your mother!
- No! She isn't!

579
01:08:16,053 --> 01:08:20,900
Arise, Goddess of Spirits!

580
01:08:27,398 --> 01:08:29,708
Evil spirit! If you do not
let go of Shyam...

581
01:08:29,967 --> 01:08:33,779
I'll drink your blood!
I'll hack you to pieces!

582
01:08:33,971 --> 01:08:36,975
Say it! Is she your mother?

583
01:08:39,744 --> 01:08:41,382
Stop hitting me!

584
01:08:42,313 --> 01:08:43,553
Why don't you believe me?!

585
01:08:44,248 --> 01:08:45,727
No! Please! Spare me!

586
01:08:46,150 --> 01:08:48,426
Say it!
- No!

587
01:08:48,686 --> 01:08:51,257
Say it!
- Yes!

588
01:08:51,656 --> 01:08:52,760
Yes!

589
01:08:52,924 --> 01:08:54,460
Are you Shyam?
- Yes!

590
01:08:55,526 --> 01:08:57,164
Is she your mother?
- Yes!

591
01:08:57,395 --> 01:09:00,239
Please! Don't do this!
You're right!

592
01:09:00,498 --> 01:09:03,308
Hail The Goddess of Spirits!

593
01:09:03,634 --> 01:09:12,110
By the grace of the Goddess,
he is exorcised!

594
01:09:12,443 --> 01:09:15,788
Sure! Gone! For good!

595
01:09:16,214 --> 01:09:20,720
Let him rest now.
He's going to be all right.

596
01:09:30,261 --> 01:09:34,073
What are you doing?
- Returning the jacket.

597
01:09:34,398 --> 01:09:39,108
Keep it. It looks great on you.
- But it belongs to your father.

598
01:09:39,370 --> 01:09:44,376
He might say I stole his jacket.
- You've already stolen...

599
01:09:44,609 --> 01:09:48,250
The one thing he values most.
This, you can keep.

600
01:09:48,846 --> 01:09:50,883
If you insist.

601
01:09:52,750 --> 01:09:53,888
What's going on over there?

602
01:10:00,591 --> 01:10:02,298
Packing. To leave.

603
01:10:04,428 --> 01:10:06,772
Good times seem to fly.

604
01:10:11,168 --> 01:10:16,277
These few days with you were
the happiest days of my life.

605
01:10:16,908 --> 01:10:24,190
Never have I been so happy.
-I am very apprehensive.

606
01:10:24,515 --> 01:10:28,292
Hope you aren't sorry afterwards.
- That will never happen.

607
01:10:28,553 --> 01:10:31,966
I wish to tell you something.
- Say it.

608
01:10:32,223 --> 01:10:35,170
Tell me a thousand things,
a million things.

609
01:10:35,459 --> 01:10:37,666
I could listen to you
all my life!

610
01:10:37,929 --> 01:10:39,670
And you wouldn't have
said enough!

611
01:10:39,864 --> 01:10:45,940
I didn't expect to fall for you.

612
01:10:46,604 --> 01:10:50,882
You don't know what
I'm going through.

613
01:10:51,208 --> 01:10:56,715
All I think of is you.
-I am fortunate.

614
01:10:57,548 --> 01:11:01,997
I have found the greatest gift.
I am so lucky!

615
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:06,566
When I think of it,
oh I could cry!

616
01:11:13,931 --> 01:11:16,172
If you're through
with your meeting...

617
01:11:16,434 --> 01:11:19,176
Do step inside.
We'll miss the train.

618
01:11:50,801 --> 01:11:53,611
Slow down, Ram.
Take it easy.

619
01:11:53,871 --> 01:11:55,544
Let a hungry man
eat his fill.

620
01:11:55,740 --> 01:11:57,219
He'll bless you
with all his heart.

621
01:11:59,810 --> 01:12:05,226
Not a bit shy when it comes to
having his fill. I like that.

622
01:12:05,449 --> 01:12:09,158
Breakfast, lunch and dinner
he has it all in every go!

623
01:12:10,021 --> 01:12:13,559
Mr. Gajendra is here.
- I'm coming.

624
01:12:14,025 --> 01:12:17,905
Here comes your man.
- Well, let him come.

625
01:12:18,829 --> 01:12:22,868
Now which is this one?
- Your brother-in-law.

626
01:12:23,367 --> 01:12:27,076
My brother-in-law? Which one?
- Forgotten him already?

627
01:12:27,338 --> 01:12:31,377
Yes! Brother-in-law!
Arrived, has he?

628
01:12:31,842 --> 01:12:35,289
Don't mind my saying this,
but I don't like him a bit.

629
01:12:36,047 --> 01:12:41,429
I don't like him a bit either.
- Why are you so scared of him?

630
01:12:42,153 --> 01:12:48,001
Even his father couldn't scare me!
- You were trembling the other day.

631
01:12:48,225 --> 01:12:50,501
Which other day?
- The day we went over for tea.

632
01:12:50,695 --> 01:12:53,141
Oh, that day?!

633
01:12:53,597 --> 01:12:59,878
Gone are those days.
Just let him come. You'll see.

634
01:13:02,973 --> 01:13:07,683
He's here to take you home.
Be seated Gajendra.

635
01:13:07,945 --> 01:13:09,982
Have breakfast.
- No, thank you.

636
01:13:41,345 --> 01:13:43,916
Relationships between
brothers-in-law...

637
01:13:44,148 --> 01:13:44,956
Have always been edgy.

638
01:13:45,249 --> 01:13:50,597
Not to be cross. So what if Ram
has spent a few days with us?

639
01:13:50,821 --> 01:13:54,064
Yes, no harm done?
- You wouldn't know...

640
01:13:54,358 --> 01:13:58,170
What his sister and his niece have
been through after he went missing.

641
01:13:58,529 --> 01:14:00,133
Your niece has taken ill.

642
01:14:03,334 --> 01:14:06,747
What I don't understand is how
you dared to leave home like this?

643
01:14:07,805 --> 01:14:11,651
It isn't fair of you to scold him
for every other thing.

644
01:14:14,845 --> 01:14:17,018
Ready to go home now?

645
01:14:19,950 --> 01:14:23,898
Ready and willing. To go anywhere.
- Come along then!

646
01:14:24,121 --> 01:14:26,965
You first.
- Sharp words?

647
01:14:27,324 --> 01:14:30,828
We'll hear more once we' re home.
- Sure you will!

648
01:14:31,362 --> 01:14:34,309
Come on Gajendra,
sit down for breakfast.

649
01:14:34,465 --> 01:14:37,912
Eggs for the gentleman, please.

650
01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:56,729
The all-important question...
when is the engagement?

651
01:14:56,821 --> 01:15:00,792
Anytime you're ready.
- I'm ever ready.

652
01:15:00,991 --> 01:15:05,064
Isn't someone supposed to ask
what we have in mind?

653
01:15:05,329 --> 01:15:08,003
Who asked you to interfere?
You've had had a nice time.

654
01:15:08,132 --> 01:15:09,702
Don't you think you should be
going home quietly?

655
01:15:10,301 --> 01:15:12,713
Excuse me, may I have
a word with her?

656
01:15:13,037 --> 01:15:15,517
I didn't finish what
I was about to tell you.

657
01:15:15,739 --> 01:15:18,447
Enough time for that later.
Now you're coming home.

658
01:15:35,359 --> 01:15:41,037
Sudakshina! Come down!
Ram is home!

659
01:15:41,632 --> 01:15:48,413
Back home victorious?
Time to celebrate?

660
01:15:57,681 --> 01:16:01,959
What an outfit!

661
01:16:02,419 --> 01:16:06,265
You should've heard the way
he was talking to me!

662
01:16:06,724 --> 01:16:11,036
Two days with his in-laws,
and he puts on airs!

663
01:16:12,930 --> 01:16:18,778
Why am I being pushed around?
- You expect to be feted?

664
01:16:19,036 --> 01:16:21,448
Give him a whipping!

665
01:16:21,972 --> 01:16:23,417
Why did you run away?

666
01:16:23,841 --> 01:16:25,912
I asked why did you run away?

667
01:16:27,344 --> 01:16:28,516
Well, you see...

668
01:16:28,779 --> 01:16:30,850
Brother and sister
are in it together.

669
01:16:31,148 --> 01:16:34,595
They must've come to know
that he has to sign the papers.

670
01:16:35,019 --> 01:16:36,896
Sign, what?

671
01:16:37,187 --> 01:16:37,790
As if you don't know!

672
01:16:43,761 --> 01:16:50,371
My darling brother!
Where had you been?

673
01:16:50,601 --> 01:16:52,877
You left your helpless sister
all alone!

674
01:16:53,103 --> 01:17:00,180
Why, you didn't even tell me!
- Enough of your dramatics!

675
01:17:03,814 --> 01:17:05,816
After I'm through
with this scoundrel...

676
01:17:06,016 --> 01:17:07,324
He won't recognize himself!

677
01:17:07,785 --> 01:17:10,493
For heaven's sake!
Don't beat my brother!

678
01:17:10,788 --> 01:17:14,167
Forgive him! Please!

679
01:17:14,458 --> 01:17:19,339
He's my father's only son!
Take all his money, his wealth.

680
01:17:19,630 --> 01:17:25,273
But don't beat him
like an animal!

681
01:17:26,437 --> 01:17:34,049
Tell your darling brother that
he'd better sign the papers.

682
01:17:34,278 --> 01:17:39,159
Else, I won't spare him!
- You have my word!

683
01:17:40,851 --> 01:17:47,291
My brother will do whatever
you tell him to do.

684
01:17:55,799 --> 01:17:56,937
Uncle!

685
01:17:57,768 --> 01:17:59,611
Uncle, you' re back!

686
01:18:01,505 --> 01:18:05,043
You left me all alone!

687
01:18:15,753 --> 01:18:18,893
She has fainted.
- Let's take her upstairs.

688
01:18:32,703 --> 01:18:40,451
Kuku, open your eyes!
Look, your Uncle is here.

689
01:18:40,644 --> 01:18:43,784
Open your eyes, Kuku.
- What's wrong with her?

690
01:18:44,782 --> 01:18:50,494
She cried and cried for you.
Ever since you left...

691
01:18:50,988 --> 01:18:54,492
She hasn't been eating
or drinking.

692
01:18:54,792 --> 01:19:00,242
She wakes up in fits and starts
and she asks, where's my Uncle?

693
01:19:02,166 --> 01:19:06,581
Oh I can't bear to see
this happening to her!

694
01:19:07,237 --> 01:19:15,554
Talk to her. Give her hope, Ram.
Else, she'll die! Please!

695
01:19:19,750 --> 01:19:22,856
Kuku, open your eyes.

696
01:19:23,153 --> 01:19:30,162
Open your eyes, Kuku.

697
01:19:31,028 --> 01:19:32,974
Uncle...!

698
01:19:39,670 --> 01:19:44,585
You left us because my father
used to whip you?

699
01:19:44,908 --> 01:19:49,687
Because my father whipped you?
Is that why you left me?

700
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:54,319
Look how badly my mother got
beaten up after you went away!

701
01:19:54,818 --> 01:19:58,197
Look at that!
- Don't say that, Kuku.

702
01:19:58,489 --> 01:20:01,663
It's none of his fault.
We' re destined to suffer!

703
01:20:01,925 --> 01:20:05,805
We can't live in peace!
We can't even die in peace!

704
01:20:09,633 --> 01:20:14,582
I hate to see what you have to
put up with.

705
01:20:14,838 --> 01:20:23,258
We'll share our sorrows.
But give me your word...

706
01:20:23,914 --> 01:20:29,125
You'll never leave this house!
- If you go away ever again...

707
01:20:29,386 --> 01:20:31,662
My father will become angry,
and he'll beat us all up!

708
01:20:31,922 --> 01:20:34,664
Give us your word, Ram.
- Say you won't, Uncle!

709
01:20:34,892 --> 01:20:38,965
Give me your word!
I beg of you!

710
01:20:39,163 --> 01:20:44,841
No! Don't do that!
- Don't ever leave us, Uncle!

711
01:20:45,936 --> 01:20:52,217
Say it Uncle, say you won't
ever leave us!

712
01:20:52,643 --> 01:20:55,021
Don't cry, my child.

713
01:20:56,713 --> 01:21:00,661
Till such time that
you weep tears...

714
01:21:00,884 --> 01:21:03,626
Till such time that
you live in terror...

715
01:21:04,021 --> 01:21:10,438
I shall never leave you.
This injustice, this brutality...

716
01:21:10,661 --> 01:21:14,609
I shall put an end to.
This I swear.

717
01:21:31,014 --> 01:21:38,660
Why are we in this temple, Shanta?
- To pray, what else?

718
01:21:38,922 --> 01:21:44,565
Why, don't you like it?
-I like everything you say.

719
01:21:45,128 --> 01:21:49,804
You've changed so much.
You used to hate the sight of me.

720
01:21:50,100 --> 01:21:54,549
You were always bashing me up.
Now you've become so nice.

721
01:21:54,905 --> 01:21:58,352
You hear me out so patiently.

722
01:21:59,710 --> 01:22:04,125
How about sentences?
No more monologues.

723
01:22:04,648 --> 01:22:13,261
I'm afraid Shanta, I might
lose you if I open my mouth.

724
01:22:14,391 --> 01:22:18,032
You don't speak such vile thoughts
before the Gods!

725
01:22:19,896 --> 01:22:26,336
To God I pray that I may
have you with me always.

726
01:22:26,703 --> 01:22:32,278
God never refuses anyone
who prays fervently.

727
01:22:34,011 --> 01:22:37,652
Eat the offering I made to God.

728
01:22:44,187 --> 01:22:47,999
Doing it on the sly?
- Forgotten your friends?

729
01:23:42,893 --> 01:23:50,436
"My lover is coming home to me"

730
01:23:51,202 --> 01:24:01,089
"I'm fretting,
my heart is joyous"

731
01:24:01,478 --> 01:24:09,590
"My lover is coming home to me"

732
01:24:10,120 --> 01:24:19,939
"I'm fretting,
my heart is joyous"

733
01:24:35,145 --> 01:24:40,117
"The wet-wet season of greens
pales without my lover"

734
01:24:42,419 --> 01:24:48,597
"Ever since my lover has come,
I'm discovering myself anew"

735
01:24:49,627 --> 01:24:55,441
"In the time of love,
I have lost my heart"

736
01:24:55,733 --> 01:24:59,340
"I'm dancing like a gypsy"

737
01:25:03,641 --> 01:25:11,423
"All night, I can't sleep"

738
01:25:11,915 --> 01:25:15,920
"I'm fretting"

739
01:25:16,353 --> 01:25:22,031
"I'm fretting,
my heart is joyous"

740
01:25:43,747 --> 01:25:48,628
"The sharp look in his eyes
has killed me"

741
01:25:50,921 --> 01:25:57,930
"Day or night, he doesn't care.
He wants me always"

742
01:25:58,128 --> 01:26:04,044
"I've lost my heart,
oh what's come over me?"

743
01:26:04,234 --> 01:26:08,080
"I'm like an urn"

744
01:26:12,276 --> 01:26:19,990
"My heart hums a lovely song"

745
01:26:20,484 --> 01:26:24,557
"I'm fretting"

746
01:26:25,055 --> 01:26:30,596
"I'm fretting,
my heart is joyous"

747
01:26:31,128 --> 01:26:38,603
"My lover is coming home to me"

748
01:26:39,136 --> 01:26:43,141
"I'm fretting"

749
01:26:43,674 --> 01:26:49,022
"I'm fretting,
my heart is joyous"

750
01:26:50,547 --> 01:26:52,390
One more cup of tea?

751
01:26:53,951 --> 01:26:56,591
A cigarette?
- Don't disturb me!

752
01:26:58,489 --> 01:27:00,332
A beedi, perhaps?
- Stop pestering me!

753
01:27:00,491 --> 01:27:02,801
I said no!
- Sorry!

754
01:27:03,026 --> 01:27:07,338
He's going on and on!
- Don't disturb him. Let him read.

755
01:27:13,570 --> 01:27:17,643
Are the papers ready?
- The registrar has the papers.

756
01:27:17,941 --> 01:27:23,118
Ask the signatory to sign.
I'm getting late for court.

757
01:27:24,515 --> 01:27:29,123
Bring Ram down. Right now.
- Right away!

758
01:27:31,622 --> 01:27:37,834
Remember what I told you? Just sign
whatever he tells you to sign.

759
01:27:38,362 --> 01:27:41,275
Understand?
- Yes.

760
01:27:43,233 --> 01:27:45,235
I'm beginning to understand
everything.

761
01:27:46,703 --> 01:27:49,684
But not to worry. Everything
is going to be all right.

762
01:27:52,976 --> 01:27:54,580
What the hell is it?

763
01:27:55,946 --> 01:27:58,586
Gajendra Babu is calling you.
Hurry up.

764
01:28:11,295 --> 01:28:12,706
10:30 already!

765
01:28:14,832 --> 01:28:18,006
Another five minutes, please.
- Been over an hour now!

766
01:28:47,564 --> 01:28:49,737
So what can I do for you?

767
01:28:50,033 --> 01:28:52,172
Don't you know you're supposed
to sign the papers today?

768
01:28:52,803 --> 01:28:58,412
Please take his signatures.
- Johnny-come-lately. Sign up.

769
01:28:58,942 --> 01:29:01,616
May I go through the papers?
- Please make it fast.

770
01:29:33,310 --> 01:29:37,190
So you don't intend to sign?
- Just because you told me to...

771
01:29:37,481 --> 01:29:42,260
You expect me to jump off a cliff,
or hang myself from a tree?

772
01:29:42,953 --> 01:29:46,992
What do you take me for?
A moron?

773
01:29:47,858 --> 01:29:50,862
But they told me
you'd simply sign it.

774
01:29:51,228 --> 01:29:54,368
What?
- They said you would!

775
01:29:54,665 --> 01:29:56,906
Who told you that?
- They said that!

776
01:29:57,134 --> 01:29:59,808
Said what?
- That you'll come and sign it.

777
01:30:00,103 --> 01:30:03,607
I've come, but I won't sign.
- You won't sign it?

778
01:30:06,243 --> 01:30:10,350
In that case, you may leave.
- You may leave too.

779
01:31:12,442 --> 01:31:19,587
Is this some miracle?!
Gajendra ran away!

780
01:31:20,951 --> 01:31:26,458
Justice, delayed sometimes.
Never denied.

781
01:31:26,957 --> 01:31:33,306
Do these scoundrels think that
they can get away with anything?

782
01:31:34,598 --> 01:31:39,274
God created Ram
to destroy the evil...

783
01:31:39,569 --> 01:31:43,176
And to protect the virtuous.
He sends me here, duly modified.

784
01:32:32,155 --> 01:32:37,161
Ram! What are you doing?! Stop it!

785
01:32:37,294 --> 01:32:40,241
Get out of my way!
I'm going to flay him alive!

786
01:32:40,731 --> 01:32:42,972
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?!

787
01:33:02,953 --> 01:33:04,261
Did you ask for me, sir?

788
01:33:07,724 --> 01:33:09,897
I have considered
the Union's demands.

789
01:33:10,427 --> 01:33:14,341
Why not give the workers
a share of the profits?

790
01:33:15,432 --> 01:33:19,847
I have decided to award
a 3-month bonus.

791
01:33:22,572 --> 01:33:26,281
What are you up to?!
- Why, what happened?

792
01:33:26,543 --> 01:33:29,922
Accede to one demand, and they
will come up with a dozen!

793
01:33:30,213 --> 01:33:33,387
Before wasting so much money,
you should've at least...

794
01:33:33,650 --> 01:33:37,257
Consulted Gajendra Babu.
- What is his locus stand?

795
01:33:37,921 --> 01:33:39,958
And who are you?
- No one at all!

796
01:33:40,157 --> 01:33:43,070
The money is neither his,
nor yours, nor mine.

797
01:33:43,860 --> 01:33:52,541
You don't know these workers!
- But I know you inside out.

798
01:33:52,736 --> 01:33:55,615
Sir...?
- I've been auditing these books.

799
01:33:55,939 --> 01:34:01,446
These books are fake.
The entries are wrong.

800
01:34:01,678 --> 01:34:04,352
The expenses are not
supported by vouchers.

801
01:34:04,681 --> 01:34:08,857
Give me one good reason
why you shouldn't be fired.

802
01:34:09,085 --> 01:34:14,865
I'm very poor, sir!
I've served you for 20 years!

803
01:34:15,058 --> 01:34:19,473
You've been ripping me off
for 20 years!

804
01:34:19,763 --> 01:34:26,442
I want every penny accounted!
Else, I'll skin you alive!

805
01:34:26,670 --> 01:34:32,552
Absolutely right. And justified.

806
01:34:32,843 --> 01:34:35,653
I used to be an accountant
in a bank.

807
01:34:35,979 --> 01:34:39,119
Made a few slip ups,
here and there.

808
01:34:39,382 --> 01:34:41,157
And the bank collapsed!

809
01:34:41,918 --> 01:34:44,558
Who might you be?
And what brings you here?

810
01:34:44,788 --> 01:34:49,669
I expected that question.
Ever heard of Kajalgaon?

811
01:34:50,193 --> 01:34:56,144
Kajalgaon... good old Kajalgaon.
The village elders in Kajalgaon...

812
01:34:56,433 --> 01:34:58,470
Advised me to ask you for a job.
- What...?!

813
01:34:58,668 --> 01:35:03,208
I can take care of
whatever he used to!

814
01:35:03,473 --> 01:35:05,680
You may leave.
Go on, get going.

815
01:35:05,976 --> 01:35:09,617
You're trying to snatch my job
of 20 years from under my nose!

816
01:35:09,913 --> 01:35:14,225
You've siphoned off your gratuity
for 20 years!

817
01:35:14,684 --> 01:35:17,756
Who the hell let you in here?
Get out of here!

818
01:35:18,021 --> 01:35:21,594
Sir! Tell him to get out!
- Go on, sir. Tell him.

819
01:35:21,858 --> 01:35:23,804
Is he in a position to ask
me to get out?

820
01:35:24,094 --> 01:35:27,337
Who gets out, he or I?
You get to decide, boss.

821
01:35:27,764 --> 01:35:32,804
Considering the situation,
it'd be better if you left.

822
01:35:32,936 --> 01:35:34,643
Sir...?
- You had better leave.

823
01:35:34,905 --> 01:35:39,877
He will scrutinize your accounts.
- What are you saying, sir?!

824
01:35:40,143 --> 01:35:43,215
He's just a little boy!
He gets to scrutinize me?!

825
01:35:43,680 --> 01:35:46,957
Any objections?
- None at all, sir!

826
01:35:47,183 --> 01:35:48,560
Then please leave.

827
01:35:50,620 --> 01:35:53,533
If you can beat the daylights
out of Gajendra Babu...

828
01:35:53,823 --> 01:35:57,635
I guess I'm small fry.
- Get lost.

829
01:36:00,163 --> 01:36:05,203
Found you, my Lord!
At long last!

830
01:36:05,502 --> 01:36:07,106
Are you joking?

831
01:36:07,370 --> 01:36:10,408
Do you know what insurmountable
difficulties I face?

832
01:36:10,974 --> 01:36:16,856
Whatever the difficulties,
I'm willing to help, Shyam!

833
01:36:17,113 --> 01:36:18,820
Not Shyam!

834
01:36:19,149 --> 01:36:21,686
I'm Ramchandra.

835
01:36:44,240 --> 01:36:45,275
Silence!

836
01:36:47,377 --> 01:36:48,788
Stop screaming!

837
01:36:51,581 --> 01:36:53,322
What is this chaos?

838
01:36:56,186 --> 01:37:00,635
This is my birthday cake.
You'll take a bite, won't you?

839
01:37:00,857 --> 01:37:02,803
I don't eat these
disgusting things!

840
01:37:25,815 --> 01:37:27,385
Open your mouth.

841
01:37:28,985 --> 01:37:30,794
Open your mouth, Gajendra Babu.

842
01:37:33,990 --> 01:37:37,164
I told you to open your mouth!

843
01:37:43,666 --> 01:37:48,206
Misbehaving your daughter's
birthday? Aren't you ashamed?

844
01:37:49,439 --> 01:37:52,420
Don't you ever behave
like this here.

845
01:37:53,710 --> 01:37:55,348
Now leave.

846
01:38:07,123 --> 01:38:09,831
Hold it right there!

847
01:38:11,127 --> 01:38:19,046
Look! A pearl just dropped out
of her eye! See how it shines!

848
01:38:19,369 --> 01:38:22,578
Just like the rays of the sun!

849
01:38:23,406 --> 01:38:27,047
A priceless pearl! it's mine!

850
01:38:27,410 --> 01:38:30,414
I'm not about to give it
to Kuku!

851
01:38:30,713 --> 01:38:35,526
Now she's going to smile!

852
01:39:06,950 --> 01:39:10,227
"Happy times are here,
this is the end of our woes"

853
01:39:10,453 --> 01:39:15,903
"Here's the season of love
end of the gloom"

854
01:39:16,759 --> 01:39:20,366
"Ram has worked a miracle"

855
01:39:20,897 --> 01:39:24,640
"Shyam has cast a magic spell"

856
01:39:25,502 --> 01:39:29,507
"Happy times are here,
this is the end of our woes"

857
01:39:29,939 --> 01:39:34,149
"Here's the season of love
end of the gloom"

858
01:39:34,911 --> 01:39:38,552
"Ram has worked a miracle"

859
01:39:39,182 --> 01:39:42,891
"Shyam has cast a magic spell"

860
01:39:53,396 --> 01:40:01,406
"In bright sunlight,
the darkness is dispelled"

861
01:40:06,509 --> 01:40:14,655
"Every new day brings
a new hope"

862
01:40:19,689 --> 01:40:22,295
"You must sing"

863
01:40:23,960 --> 01:40:26,668
"You must play the drums"

864
01:40:33,002 --> 01:40:37,417
"Our Munni will break into a jig"

865
01:40:37,740 --> 01:40:41,847
"Happy times are here,
this is the end of our woes"

866
01:40:42,212 --> 01:40:46,319
"Here's the season of love
end of the gloom"

867
01:40:46,916 --> 01:40:51,092
"Ram has worked a miracle"

868
01:40:51,487 --> 01:40:55,128
"Shyam has cast a magic spell"

869
01:41:04,667 --> 01:41:13,883
"No more stories of helplessness
in our home"

870
01:41:18,581 --> 01:41:26,398
"Let love bring us all together"

871
01:41:31,461 --> 01:41:34,067
"Our days are changed..."

872
01:41:35,898 --> 01:41:38,504
"we will reach our goal"

873
01:41:44,841 --> 01:41:49,085
"Let's sing the song of life always"

874
01:41:49,445 --> 01:41:53,484
"Happy times are here,
this is the end of our woes"

875
01:41:53,883 --> 01:41:58,025
"Here's the season of love
end of the gloom"

876
01:41:58,588 --> 01:42:02,400
"Ram has worked a miracle"

877
01:42:03,059 --> 01:42:06,506
"Shyam has cast a magic spell"

878
01:42:19,242 --> 01:42:23,657
"No one will go hungry"

879
01:42:23,846 --> 01:42:27,623
"No one will go thirsty"

880
01:42:32,388 --> 01:42:40,534
"No more servants,
no more masters"

881
01:42:45,168 --> 01:42:47,671
"In your home, you are King..."

882
01:42:49,472 --> 01:42:51,884
"free to sing your song"

883
01:42:58,481 --> 01:43:02,224
"Sing, and you'll find yourself
singing the song of life"

884
01:43:02,685 --> 01:43:06,963
"Happy times are here,
this is the end of our woes"

885
01:43:07,290 --> 01:43:11,329
"Here's the season of love
end of the gloom"

886
01:43:11,861 --> 01:43:15,536
"Ram has worked a miracle"

887
01:43:16,332 --> 01:43:20,109
"Shyam has cast a magic spell"

888
01:43:41,572 --> 01:43:46,282
You're wearing an old dress.
Why not the new one I gave you?

889
01:43:46,577 --> 01:43:49,353
Don't get worked up, Mummy.
Uncle is getting engaged.

890
01:43:49,613 --> 01:43:53,584
Not I.
- Just go and wear it.

891
01:43:55,419 --> 01:43:59,128
Where do I put this?
-Why did you bring this here already?

892
01:43:59,457 --> 01:44:01,266
This will go with the girl
tomorrow.

893
01:44:01,425 --> 01:44:02,733
Go put it inside.

894
01:44:03,527 --> 01:44:07,134
It's time for everyone to come and
no one is in sight.

895
01:44:07,465 --> 01:44:10,605
Hello, Ms Sudakshina!

896
01:44:11,469 --> 01:44:13,608
So here we are.

897
01:44:17,108 --> 01:44:21,318
You are looking so pretty.
May you be happy always.

898
01:44:22,313 --> 01:44:24,122
Welcome.

899
01:44:28,519 --> 01:44:34,435
Stuck to the chair or something?
They've been calling and calling.

900
01:44:34,658 --> 01:44:38,606
The party is on, and everyone
is waiting for you.

901
01:44:39,430 --> 01:44:41,501
I can't do this!

902
01:44:42,066 --> 01:44:44,945
Anjana thinks I am Ram!

903
01:44:47,438 --> 01:44:51,443
How am I going to face her when
she comes to know the truth?

904
01:44:53,210 --> 01:44:58,990
If you're such an angel,
why did you have the affair?

905
01:44:59,350 --> 01:45:04,823
You should've told her clearly.
- I tried to. I wanted to.

906
01:45:05,056 --> 01:45:07,935
I tried to screw up the courage
to tell her. But not one chance.

907
01:45:08,192 --> 01:45:10,433
No one would hear me out!
And now...

908
01:45:19,537 --> 01:45:23,007
Okay, if the office is closed,
where is he?

909
01:45:24,175 --> 01:45:27,520
Send him home directly
when he arrives.

910
01:45:27,745 --> 01:45:29,349
Everyone is waiting for him.

911
01:45:32,716 --> 01:45:36,289
I apologize for the trouble
we are causing you.

912
01:45:38,022 --> 01:45:42,129
Sudakshina, take Anjana upstairs.
Let her rest till Ram arrives.

913
01:45:43,794 --> 01:45:45,102
Come, dear.

914
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:55,712
Napoleon paced up and down
while his armies waited.

915
01:45:55,906 --> 01:45:57,749
Any decision yet?

916
01:46:01,912 --> 01:46:06,486
It's eleven in the night.
No point waiting any longer.

917
01:46:07,218 --> 01:46:12,361
Please send Anjana down.
We would like to leave.

918
01:46:15,693 --> 01:46:18,765
For God's sake, please wait
a little while.

919
01:46:19,230 --> 01:46:24,407
Ram will surely come.
- This is intolerable!

920
01:46:24,702 --> 01:46:29,742
We have been ridiculed in public!
- Forgive us.

921
01:46:34,278 --> 01:46:38,158
Ram is here!
My brother has come!

922
01:46:47,124 --> 01:46:49,730
My uncle has come!

923
01:46:50,594 --> 01:46:52,540
Has he come?
- Yes!

924
01:46:53,297 --> 01:46:56,904
He's here now.
Why are you crying?

925
01:46:58,969 --> 01:47:01,108
Because he is late?

926
01:47:01,472 --> 01:47:06,785
Come on downstairs,
we'll tell him off!

927
01:47:14,952 --> 01:47:19,458
What is the matter?
Why are you crying?

928
01:47:19,690 --> 01:47:23,365
Mummy, what happened?
- Is Ram all right?

929
01:47:23,961 --> 01:47:28,000
Mummy! Say nothing
has happened to him!

930
01:47:28,399 --> 01:47:30,799
I nearly fainted when
I saw Sudakshina!

931
01:47:53,023 --> 01:47:56,800
She was in tears...
I thought of the worst!

932
01:48:06,804 --> 01:48:09,045
What happened?

933
01:48:11,075 --> 01:48:12,713
Why is everyone silent?

934
01:48:16,480 --> 01:48:18,050
What is the matter, Daddy?

935
01:48:18,749 --> 01:48:21,457
Let him own up.

936
01:48:23,921 --> 01:48:28,768
What happened Ram?
Why are you silent?

937
01:48:32,229 --> 01:48:37,907
Forgive me. I will not enter
into an engagement with you.

938
01:48:39,069 --> 01:48:45,042
I will not marry you like this.
I cannot cheat my conscience.

939
01:48:45,509 --> 01:48:53,724
I know I'm hurting you.
Forgive me, if you can.

940
01:49:17,041 --> 01:49:23,219
Take me away from here. At once!

941
01:49:23,781 --> 01:49:25,385
Yes my dear.

942
01:49:29,420 --> 01:49:32,264
Let us leave.

943
01:50:10,828 --> 01:50:17,074
"Darling, in the cold fires
of your love..."

944
01:50:17,234 --> 01:50:22,308
"Darling, in the cold fires
of your love..."

945
01:50:22,573 --> 01:50:28,114
"I'm lost"

946
01:50:28,379 --> 01:50:33,260
"Oh I' m lost"

947
01:50:33,717 --> 01:50:39,030
"You stole my heart somewhere
along the way..."

948
01:50:39,323 --> 01:50:44,204
"You stole my heart somewhere
along the way..."

949
01:50:44,428 --> 01:50:49,468
"with that look in your eyes"

950
01:50:49,767 --> 01:50:55,012
"Oh that look in your eyes"

951
01:51:16,360 --> 01:51:19,466
"I'm crazy..."

952
01:51:19,763 --> 01:51:22,300
" I' m your lover"

953
01:51:22,966 --> 01:51:24,639
"I'm crazy..."

954
01:51:24,902 --> 01:51:27,382
" I' m your lover"

955
01:51:27,604 --> 01:51:30,847
"Don't desert my heart"

956
01:51:35,946 --> 01:51:44,957
"Just like today, come to see me
again tomorrow, all alone"

957
01:51:50,227 --> 01:51:55,939
"Like the sun and the moon,
I've risen, set, waxed and waned"

958
01:51:56,166 --> 01:52:00,615
"But now I'm lost"

959
01:52:00,871 --> 01:52:06,082
"Oh that look in your eyes"

960
01:52:06,443 --> 01:52:12,291
"Darling, in the cold fires
of your love..."

961
01:52:12,549 --> 01:52:16,929
"You stole my heart somewhere
along the way..."

962
01:52:17,187 --> 01:52:22,364
"with that look in your eyes"

963
01:52:38,342 --> 01:52:40,742
"You cast a spell on me
with your beauty..."

964
01:52:49,453 --> 01:52:53,230
"and you stole my heart"

965
01:52:57,561 --> 01:53:06,640
"Darling, touch my heartstrings,
you've awakened me to love"

966
01:53:11,775 --> 01:53:16,622
"You've made me fall for
that loving look in your eyes"

967
01:53:16,947 --> 01:53:21,794
"Oh that look in your eyes"

968
01:53:22,085 --> 01:53:27,467
"Oh I' m lost"

969
01:53:27,824 --> 01:53:33,001
"You stole my heart somewhere
along the way..."

970
01:53:33,263 --> 01:53:38,042
"Darling, in the cold fires
of your love..."

971
01:53:38,302 --> 01:53:43,183
"I'm lost"

972
01:55:08,190 --> 01:55:09,692
Are you hurt?

973
01:55:10,793 --> 01:55:13,774
What happened?
- I fainted.

974
01:55:15,164 --> 01:55:18,737
What's your name?
- Shanta.

975
01:55:19,301 --> 01:55:24,011
Who was that with you?
- He's my fiance.

976
01:55:24,573 --> 01:55:28,851
You're bleeding.
Are you all right?

977
01:55:30,779 --> 01:55:33,123
I don't think I'm in
a condition to drive.

978
01:55:33,382 --> 01:55:35,828
Will you go to drop me off at
home?

979
01:55:36,085 --> 01:55:39,760
Yes but let me tell me mom and
I'll bring a car also.

980
01:55:56,839 --> 01:55:58,113
What is the matter, son?

981
01:56:01,744 --> 01:56:07,023
This must be a plot! Ram even
used to be scared of my shadow!

982
01:56:07,216 --> 01:56:09,025
He would tremble when
he spoke to me!

983
01:56:09,285 --> 01:56:12,266
And now he could kill me
with that look in his eyes!

984
01:56:12,588 --> 01:56:19,699
Mr. Rao must be behind all this.
- Nonsense. Had he been...

985
01:56:19,895 --> 01:56:24,674
Ram wouldn't have refused Anjana.
There's must be a secret!

986
01:56:24,967 --> 01:56:30,918
Our lives are tied to the secret.
I must get to the bottom of this!

987
01:56:32,975 --> 01:56:39,688
Never in my life have I seen
such a scoundrel!

988
01:56:40,516 --> 01:56:46,228
You're still in love with him?
You must be out of your mind.

989
01:56:47,356 --> 01:56:55,241
He has a place in my heart.
I cannot pull him down.

990
01:56:56,098 --> 01:57:02,515
I hate to hear such lowly things
spoken about him.

991
01:57:02,805 --> 01:57:06,446
There must be some reason
compelling enough.

992
01:57:06,809 --> 01:57:10,347
He's a fraud!

993
01:57:10,646 --> 01:57:14,184
Ram has cheated us!

994
01:57:14,483 --> 01:57:20,832
I saw him flirting openly with
the girl sitting downstairs!

995
01:57:21,156 --> 01:57:25,195
You might have been mistaken.
- If you don't believe me...

996
01:57:25,494 --> 01:57:28,998
You can ask her. This is just
why I brought her along.

997
01:57:36,639 --> 01:57:39,916
Is your father all right?

998
01:57:41,176 --> 01:57:44,817
He's better, thank you.
It was very kind of you...

999
01:57:45,114 --> 01:57:49,756
To come all the way to drop him.
- He's old enough to be my father.

1000
01:57:50,019 --> 01:57:53,694
He was bleeding.
I felt sorry for him.

1001
01:57:53,956 --> 01:57:57,028
He asked me to accompany him.
So I came along.

1002
01:57:57,326 --> 01:58:01,741
Now I'd like to go home.
I'm afraid, it's getting late.

1003
01:58:02,331 --> 01:58:09,772
You're Shania, aren't you?
- Yes, why?

1004
01:58:10,472 --> 01:58:13,316
Do you know Ramchandra?

1005
01:58:13,776 --> 01:58:19,556
Now who doesn't know Ramchandra?
He's a God.

1006
01:58:19,782 --> 01:58:23,195
The whole world worships him.
I worship him too.

1007
01:58:23,452 --> 01:58:29,334
Not Lord Ramchandra. I'm talking
about the late Yeshwantrads son.

1008
01:58:29,591 --> 01:58:34,233
He's rich, owns mills, factories.
- If he's really that rich...

1009
01:58:34,496 --> 01:58:38,069
I'm afraid I wouldn't know him.
- Then who was the man with you?

1010
01:58:38,300 --> 01:58:40,940
He ran when he saw my father.

1011
01:58:41,704 --> 01:58:43,115
He...?

1012
01:58:48,644 --> 01:58:54,788
Who is he? How is he related to you?
- This is embarrassing...

1013
01:58:55,784 --> 01:59:01,257
He isn't Ramchandra, is he?
- No. He's Aunt Ganga's son.

1014
01:59:01,557 --> 01:59:04,868
He has a big farm.
- How long have you known him?

1015
01:59:05,227 --> 01:59:10,734
We grew up together.
He used to be so rash!

1016
01:59:11,066 --> 01:59:16,846
But he's improving.
We call him Shyam.

1017
01:59:19,808 --> 01:59:25,622
I knew it! It could never happen!
My father has made a big mistake!

1018
01:59:26,315 --> 01:59:30,388
What mistake?
- it's nothing.

1019
01:59:30,719 --> 01:59:32,198
You're so nice!

1020
01:59:35,958 --> 01:59:38,939
There's the car. You must be
getting late. Now go home.

1021
01:59:39,261 --> 01:59:41,468
Remember to invite us
for the wedding.

1022
01:59:55,244 --> 01:59:57,417
How did Shyam's photo
land up here?

1023
01:59:57,913 --> 02:00:00,257
This is Ram. Not Shyam.

1024
02:00:00,949 --> 02:00:04,055
You must be mistaken.
-I don't live in sin!

1025
02:00:04,386 --> 02:00:06,024
I'd never stake claim to
someone else's man.

1026
02:00:06,355 --> 02:00:10,098
But this is my Shyam! I could
tell him with my eyes closed.

1027
02:00:10,425 --> 02:00:15,738
No! This is Ramchandra.
I'm supposed to marry him.

1028
02:00:16,031 --> 02:00:20,138
This is a fantastic story!
You're telling a lie!

1029
02:00:20,369 --> 02:00:21,507
Get out of here!
- All right, I'll go away.

1030
02:00:21,804 --> 02:00:25,081
Give me Shyam's photograph.
You have no right to keep this.

1031
02:00:25,340 --> 02:00:27,047
Give it to me!
- Leave it!

1032
02:00:27,309 --> 02:00:29,482
Let go, I say!
And get out!

1033
02:00:32,848 --> 02:00:37,627
This girl is not to blame!

1034
02:00:38,086 --> 02:00:44,367
The scoundrel changed his name!
He took advantage of both of you!

1035
02:00:49,998 --> 02:00:54,344
You did us a great favor
by coming here.

1036
02:00:54,636 --> 02:00:57,742
Take my advice. Stay away
from this impostor.

1037
02:01:05,180 --> 02:01:07,888
I'm very sorry about
Ram's behavior.

1038
02:01:08,350 --> 02:01:13,800
But now I have discovered
his Janus face.

1039
02:01:14,323 --> 02:01:18,169
Everything is going to be
all right. I assure you.

1040
02:01:23,966 --> 02:01:29,143
You scoundrel! You acted like
a simpleton, and you fooled me!

1041
02:01:29,404 --> 02:01:32,214
Then you turn city-slicker,
and you trap Anjana.

1042
02:01:32,507 --> 02:01:38,253
I'm going to talk to your mother!

1043
02:01:38,614 --> 02:01:43,120
You're mistaken, I tell you!
- Mistaken?

1044
02:01:43,385 --> 02:01:48,892
You think I'm blind? I saw
your photograph in her house!

1045
02:01:49,224 --> 02:01:53,070
If you're innocent, why did you
run when you saw the old man?

1046
02:01:53,362 --> 02:01:57,504
Because he wanted me
to marry his daughter.

1047
02:01:57,766 --> 02:02:01,304
What?!
- If you scream so much...

1048
02:02:01,603 --> 02:02:03,514
How can anyone have
a conversation with you?

1049
02:02:03,805 --> 02:02:08,777
Your trick isn't working, Shyam!
- My name isn't Shyam!

1050
02:02:08,877 --> 02:02:10,879
My name isn't Sham.

1051
02:02:11,179 --> 02:02:16,253
Then who are you?
I'll hit you if you lie to me!

1052
02:02:16,518 --> 02:02:22,833
This is the truth. When I was
screaming to tell you the truth...

1053
02:02:23,091 --> 02:02:30,066
You people beat me to pulp!
I clammed up. What could I do?

1054
02:02:32,234 --> 02:02:36,114
You don't know this. I ran away
from home to save my life!

1055
02:02:39,074 --> 02:02:43,682
He wanted me to sign a paper,
and then he'd kill me!

1056
02:02:43,979 --> 02:02:46,960
He's a devil!
- Devil? Who...?

1057
02:02:47,215 --> 02:02:53,188
My brother-in-law.
- He's referring to me.

1058
02:02:56,992 --> 02:03:03,068
So here is Mr. Ramchandra.
In hiding with your beau?

1059
02:03:03,298 --> 02:03:04,641
Get him.

1060
02:03:06,268 --> 02:03:08,407
Don't you dare!

1061
02:03:10,272 --> 02:03:16,223
Fool, the one you're risking
your life for, isn't Shyam.

1062
02:03:16,445 --> 02:03:18,789
This one is Ram.
He's a retard.

1063
02:03:22,250 --> 02:03:28,826
Whoever he is, he's mine.
Anyone who touches him is dead!

1064
02:03:29,424 --> 02:03:30,835
Bring her along too.

1065
02:03:48,543 --> 02:03:51,149
My suspicions turned out
to be true.

1066
02:03:51,480 --> 02:03:57,658
Ram isn't who we thought he was.
He's a impostor. He's dangerous.

1067
02:03:58,053 --> 02:04:02,502
I have substantial proof
against him.

1068
02:04:02,791 --> 02:04:05,567
Have you informed the police?
- Yes.

1069
02:04:05,894 --> 02:04:09,103
The police will be there at
Anjana's birthday party.

1070
02:04:09,731 --> 02:04:15,704
Have you sent him an invitation?
- He'll receive it this evening.

1071
02:04:23,912 --> 02:04:29,021
You have tried your best.
But there's no way out now.

1072
02:04:29,684 --> 02:04:31,857
How are you going to respond
to this invitation?

1073
02:04:33,255 --> 02:04:41,675
Why did he invite us after
all that has happened?

1074
02:04:42,297 --> 02:04:48,475
He has forgiven us.
He's magnanimous.

1075
02:04:49,037 --> 02:04:55,977
No better a chance for us
to make amends, Ram.

1076
02:04:56,044 --> 02:05:00,424
We must attend.
- You'll go won't you?

1077
02:05:04,686 --> 02:05:06,165
I surely will.

1078
02:05:27,476 --> 02:05:33,893
How come he's here?
- You will know, soon.

1079
02:05:53,034 --> 02:05:57,881
No one would've guessed that a man
who looks so straight and simple...

1080
02:05:58,106 --> 02:06:00,518
Could be so crooked.

1081
02:06:01,443 --> 02:06:03,354
Happy birthday, Anjana.

1082
02:06:04,546 --> 02:06:10,053
I have written a letter to you.
I'd be grateful if you read it.

1083
02:06:13,421 --> 02:06:19,428
I know I have fallen from grace.
But may I have a word with you?

1084
02:06:19,694 --> 02:06:21,833
That won't be necessary.

1085
02:06:23,031 --> 02:06:28,174
Now for the curtain call.
- Go ahead.

1086
02:06:32,741 --> 02:06:36,587
Attention, ladies and gentlemen.

1087
02:06:38,713 --> 02:06:41,113
On this happy occasion,
Ramchandra will sing a song.

1088
02:06:50,225 --> 02:06:53,798
I hope he won't refuse me.

1089
02:06:57,032 --> 02:07:00,013
What are you doing?
- This is your chance...

1090
02:07:00,302 --> 02:07:02,942
To speak out in public.
Go on.

1091
02:07:03,205 --> 02:07:05,845
Put this chance to good use.

1092
02:07:06,208 --> 02:07:10,088
No, don't be shy.
You sang so well the other day.

1093
02:07:10,478 --> 02:07:13,823
Go on, sing.
Anjana will be happy.

1094
02:07:44,446 --> 02:07:46,846
"Let lamps light up the night
as pretty as a bride"

1095
02:08:04,833 --> 02:08:07,233
"Let my grieving heart burn,
to light up the night"

1096
02:08:30,158 --> 02:08:33,901
"Tonight..."

1097
02:08:34,229 --> 02:08:38,200
"accept my heartfelt love"

1098
02:08:38,400 --> 02:08:42,075
"accept my heartfelt love"

1099
02:08:42,337 --> 02:08:49,755
"Tomorrow...
I will be gone from your life"

1100
02:08:50,078 --> 02:08:57,087
"The lamp will still burn,
the firefly will be gone"

1101
02:08:57,385 --> 02:08:59,785
"Tonight...
accept my heartfelt love"

1102
02:09:20,508 --> 02:09:28,393
"l wish you a happy joyous life"

1103
02:09:28,683 --> 02:09:35,794
"l still haven't refused your love"

1104
02:09:36,224 --> 02:09:43,699
"l wish you always remain
as beautiful, my love"

1105
02:09:43,965 --> 02:09:51,076
"Oh, just smile at me
for once and see..."

1106
02:09:51,439 --> 02:09:59,085
"then your lover will be gone
forever"

1107
02:09:59,280 --> 02:10:01,851
"Tomorrow..."

1108
02:10:02,117 --> 02:10:06,759
"l will be gone from your life"

1109
02:10:07,055 --> 02:10:14,166
"The lamp will still burn,
the firefly will be gone"

1110
02:10:14,429 --> 02:10:16,829
"Tonight...
accept my heartfelt love"

1111
02:10:37,118 --> 02:10:44,866
"l wanted to tell you the truth
about myself"

1112
02:10:45,193 --> 02:10:52,202
"But you never understood
the secret of my love"

1113
02:10:52,567 --> 02:10:59,917
"Today I stand on the brink..."

1114
02:11:00,275 --> 02:11:07,591
"for you read my love as hatred"

1115
02:11:07,949 --> 02:11:15,868
"This stranger won't stand
in your way anymore"

1116
02:11:16,124 --> 02:11:22,973
"Tomorrow...
I will be gone from your life"

1117
02:11:23,264 --> 02:11:30,307
"The lamp will still burn,
the firefly will be gone"

1118
02:11:30,605 --> 02:11:33,005
"Tonight...
accept my heartfelt love"

1119
02:11:54,896 --> 02:12:02,371
"Even if you won't love me..."

1120
02:12:02,770 --> 02:12:09,688
"l shall still turn back"

1121
02:12:10,078 --> 02:12:17,496
"The Moon and the stars
will kiss your feet"

1122
02:12:17,652 --> 02:12:24,797
"But I'll be lost forever like
a speck of dust on your path"

1123
02:12:25,126 --> 02:12:32,510
"With me, my tale
will be lost forever"

1124
02:12:32,767 --> 02:12:40,117
"Tomorrow...
I will be gone from your life"

1125
02:12:40,408 --> 02:12:47,417
"The lamp will still burn,
the firefly will be gone"

1126
02:12:47,682 --> 02:12:50,082
"Tonight...
accept my heartfelt love"

1127
02:13:24,850 --> 02:13:30,459
Ask me why I slapped you!
Ask me!

1128
02:13:34,759 --> 02:13:41,176
I do not wish to ask anything.
- If you hate us so much...

1129
02:13:41,500 --> 02:13:47,075
Why did you invite us?
You misbehaved with my brother!

1130
02:13:47,372 --> 02:13:51,115
The right and the wrong of it,
you will soon know.

1131
02:13:51,643 --> 02:13:57,457
He insulted us in public.

1132
02:13:57,716 --> 02:14:05,464
Now he pays for his deceit.

1133
02:14:05,857 --> 02:14:10,363
The son of Raja Yeshwantrao
stands in silence?

1134
02:14:10,529 --> 02:14:12,975
Why, what has happened
to our brave Ram?

1135
02:14:13,265 --> 02:14:17,577
Speak, speak in your defense!
- How will he defend himself?

1136
02:14:17,969 --> 02:14:22,714
This man whom you take for
your sibling...

1137
02:14:23,208 --> 02:14:31,423
Is a lowly impostor.
He isn't your brother.

1138
02:14:33,118 --> 02:14:41,003
He's right. He's not your brother.
He's not part of our family.

1139
02:14:41,359 --> 02:14:48,777
He isn't one of us because
you can't flog him like a beast!

1140
02:14:49,100 --> 02:14:55,608
He isn't one of us because
he stands upright before you!

1141
02:14:55,874 --> 02:14:58,878
Because he can challenge you!
That's why you say all this!

1142
02:14:59,144 --> 02:15:03,456
He isn't your brother because
he isn't your sibling.

1143
02:15:03,748 --> 02:15:07,389
This man who poses as Ram
isn't Ram at all.

1144
02:15:07,686 --> 02:15:12,294
He's just a peasant from
nearby Kajalgaon.

1145
02:15:16,795 --> 02:15:22,006
Call his mother. Let everyone
see who he is.

1146
02:15:31,643 --> 02:15:36,649
Shyam, my boy!

1147
02:15:38,383 --> 02:15:42,058
You ran away from home again!
What's wrong with you?

1148
02:15:42,721 --> 02:15:48,034
Who are these people?
Why have I been brought here?

1149
02:15:48,360 --> 02:15:54,709
You're lying! He isn't your son.
He's my brother, Ram.

1150
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:59,346
Ram, tell her that she
isn't your mother!

1151
02:15:59,838 --> 02:16:05,811
You expect my son to disown
his own mother?

1152
02:16:06,111 --> 02:16:09,251
Will you say that
I'm not your mother?

1153
02:16:10,548 --> 02:16:15,896
Look at me, son!
Will you say that?

1154
02:16:16,121 --> 02:16:19,967
Will you say such a thing?!

1155
02:16:23,461 --> 02:16:29,241
Don't be afraid of the truth.
Tell her you don't even know...

1156
02:16:29,567 --> 02:16:34,641
Who she is or where she is from!
Say it! Why don't you say it?

1157
02:16:35,106 --> 02:16:40,784
Will you say that, son?

1158
02:16:41,079 --> 02:16:43,059
Have I not brought you up?

1159
02:16:43,248 --> 02:16:48,823
Have I not been a good mother?

1160
02:16:49,054 --> 02:16:52,365
Will you ditch your poor mother
for the sake of the rich?

1161
02:16:52,724 --> 02:16:55,068
Will you wrong me?

1162
02:16:55,960 --> 02:16:59,931
Say it, son!

1163
02:17:00,098 --> 02:17:03,102
Am I not your mother?
- No! Don't cry, Mummy.

1164
02:17:07,839 --> 02:17:10,945
Don't cry, Mummy.

1165
02:17:19,351 --> 02:17:24,801
If this is Shyam, where is my Ram?
Where is my Ram?

1166
02:17:25,090 --> 02:17:28,902
Brace yourself for the bad news.

1167
02:17:29,194 --> 02:17:31,674
What...?

1168
02:17:32,497 --> 02:17:35,774
Your brother is dead.

1169
02:17:39,037 --> 02:17:44,316
Shyam took advantage of his
physical similarity with Ram.

1170
02:17:44,509 --> 02:17:48,924
He abducted Ram, and killed him
to get his hands on Ram's wealth.

1171
02:17:49,447 --> 02:17:52,360
Then he walked into our house
posing as Ram.

1172
02:17:52,717 --> 02:17:57,393
This man you think is your brother
is the man who killed your brother.

1173
02:17:58,590 --> 02:18:02,037
Ram's blood-stained clothes
were found in his house.

1174
02:18:02,327 --> 02:18:04,432
This is a lie!

1175
02:18:04,863 --> 02:18:08,436
Then let the truth out.

1176
02:18:14,305 --> 02:18:17,479
Please identify these objects.

1177
02:18:18,042 --> 02:18:21,580
Does this locket belong to
your brother Ramchandra?

1178
02:18:23,348 --> 02:18:27,319
These clothes... think
before you answer.

1179
02:18:31,356 --> 02:18:34,303
These clothes belong
to my brother!

1180
02:18:46,438 --> 02:18:53,356
What did my brother do
to harm you?

1181
02:18:54,345 --> 02:18:55,847
I did not kill him.

1182
02:18:56,147 --> 02:19:02,257
Why did you kill my brother?

1183
02:19:14,232 --> 02:19:16,632
You are under arrest for
impersonation and murder.

1184
02:19:25,977 --> 02:19:33,020
No! None of this is true!
This is a conspiracy! His!

1185
02:19:33,251 --> 02:19:34,730
I have killed no one!

1186
02:19:34,986 --> 02:19:36,693
I haven't killed anyone!

1187
02:19:57,876 --> 02:20:04,350
He's the one
who is after the money.

1188
02:20:13,491 --> 02:20:20,431
Please! Spare him!
Don't hit him!

1189
02:20:21,966 --> 02:20:23,309
Stop it!

1190
02:20:26,204 --> 02:20:30,175
No one touches this poor fellow.
Come down, Ram.

1191
02:20:33,311 --> 02:20:36,884
Why have you locked that girl up?
Bring her over here.

1192
02:20:39,250 --> 02:20:43,494
You ran away, all because
of a simple signature?

1193
02:20:43,922 --> 02:20:45,424
You've landed yourself
in trouble...

1194
02:20:45,623 --> 02:20:46,897
You've put her in trouble too.

1195
02:20:47,158 --> 02:20:50,435
Sudakshina and Kuku have cried
themselves sick for your sake.

1196
02:20:50,595 --> 02:20:52,006
Don't you care for them either?

1197
02:20:53,331 --> 02:20:55,641
Go on, sign the papers.

1198
02:20:56,067 --> 02:20:59,310
Then we'll go home.
With Shania.

1199
02:20:59,604 --> 02:21:02,915
Your sister and Kuku are waiting
eagerly for the two of you.

1200
02:21:03,207 --> 02:21:05,551
Now don't be afraid.

1201
02:21:12,417 --> 02:21:14,693
Ram! Don't sign the papers.

1202
02:21:25,897 --> 02:21:32,473
Don't! He wants to kill you!
You told me that, remember?

1203
02:21:32,704 --> 02:21:35,116
Don't worry Ram,
I'm here with you!

1204
02:21:35,306 --> 02:21:37,912
We'll die together
if we have to.

1205
02:21:38,242 --> 02:21:40,449
We won't let his wish come true!

1206
02:21:40,745 --> 02:21:45,854
Shut up! Don't interfere.
This is family business.

1207
02:21:46,217 --> 02:21:48,527
Ram is my wife's brother,
you know?

1208
02:21:48,820 --> 02:21:51,596
I know just how much
you love him!

1209
02:21:51,923 --> 02:21:55,063
Besides, if you did love him,
why did you drag us here?

1210
02:21:55,360 --> 02:22:00,673
Why did you lock us up in here?
Ram, don't sign it.

1211
02:22:01,165 --> 02:22:04,374
Will you listen to this idiot
 or will you listen to me?

1212
02:22:04,636 --> 02:22:07,583
Will you sign it, or won't you?
- I'm telling you! He won't!

1213
02:22:09,941 --> 02:22:14,253
I'm asking you! Answer me!
Will you sign? Won't you?

1214
02:22:14,512 --> 02:22:16,856
Ram won't even spit at
your papers! - Shut up!

1215
02:22:18,416 --> 02:22:22,364
Ram, are you blinded by love?
Do you challenge me?

1216
02:22:22,654 --> 02:22:25,533
Speak up! Will you sign?

1217
02:22:28,026 --> 02:22:32,133
Do what you will,
I won't sign.

1218
02:22:37,969 --> 02:22:41,314
The Inspector of Police is here.
He wants to see you.

1219
02:22:43,307 --> 02:22:44,877
Lock them up.

1220
02:23:03,428 --> 02:23:09,845
Why didn't you read this before?
- Because I was angry at him.

1221
02:23:13,705 --> 02:23:18,017
If this is true, we've joined
hands with an arch villain...

1222
02:23:18,276 --> 02:23:21,348
To send an innocent man
to the gallows!

1223
02:23:25,249 --> 02:23:29,857
If anything happens to him,
I'm going to die!

1224
02:23:32,156 --> 02:23:35,729
How long will you go on asking
the same question?

1225
02:23:36,694 --> 02:23:41,643
Until you own up.
- Then keep asking.

1226
02:23:42,100 --> 02:23:49,279
Keep me awake until I drop dead;
starve me for years...

1227
02:23:52,610 --> 02:23:57,787
Yet I'll proclaim my innocence.

1228
02:23:57,982 --> 02:24:01,794
I am being framed.
By Gajendra!

1229
02:24:03,287 --> 02:24:08,202
I'll prove my innocence!

1230
02:24:14,365 --> 02:24:18,939
Thanks. By the way, you aren't
going out, are you?

1231
02:24:19,170 --> 02:24:20,774
No.

1232
02:24:21,038 --> 02:24:23,985
If something crops up,
I might have to contact you.

1233
02:24:24,475 --> 02:24:28,446
He told you everything he knows.
What else is left to say?

1234
02:24:28,813 --> 02:24:33,023
This is a murder case.
You never know what comes up.

1235
02:25:06,050 --> 02:25:07,688
How do you do, Shyam?

1236
02:25:08,519 --> 02:25:12,228
You don't see the condition
he's in?

1237
02:27:54,518 --> 02:27:56,156
Shyam has escaped!

1238
02:28:00,124 --> 02:28:06,734
Proves that he's a criminal
on the run from the law!

1239
02:28:07,031 --> 02:28:14,882
What if he drops in on us?
What do we do then?

1240
02:28:15,139 --> 02:28:22,079
He has never succeeded against me.
He tried to, but he lost.

1241
02:28:22,279 --> 02:28:28,093
Shyam is at large, and Ram hasn't
signed the papers yet.

1242
02:28:28,419 --> 02:28:33,061
If the police get to know that
Ram is alive...

1243
02:28:33,324 --> 02:28:36,828
And that he and Shania are
being held in the outhouse...

1244
02:28:37,128 --> 02:28:43,511
And you abducted them...
and the fact that...

1245
02:28:43,734 --> 02:28:47,910
All the allegations are false
we could end up behind the bars.

1246
02:28:48,272 --> 02:28:50,343
The police will get to know
nothing!

1247
02:28:53,544 --> 02:28:56,320
Tonight, success will be ours!

1248
02:28:56,881 --> 02:29:03,264
Ram will grovel in front of me
for saving his beloved.

1249
02:29:03,988 --> 02:29:07,959
He will beg to sign the papers.
And before daybreak tomorrow...

1250
02:29:08,259 --> 02:29:11,502
Ram and Shanta's corpses will
be buried in Shyam's fields.

1251
02:29:12,696 --> 02:29:18,374
All this happened because
Ram and Shyam look so similar.

1252
02:29:18,969 --> 02:29:24,043
But identical looks are found
only in twins.

1253
02:29:24,308 --> 02:29:26,686
What are you trying to tell me?

1254
02:29:27,044 --> 02:29:32,323
Don't mind my asking this,
but is Shyam really your son?

1255
02:29:32,716 --> 02:29:40,032
Didn't you hear him calling me
"mother" in front of everyone?

1256
02:29:43,828 --> 02:29:47,708
Shyam might even be sent
to the gallows.

1257
02:29:47,998 --> 02:29:54,347
If his mother hides the truth,
the innocent boy might die!

1258
02:29:54,505 --> 02:30:01,923
No! Don't wish my son ill!
May he live a hundred years!

1259
02:30:04,648 --> 02:30:07,048
I'm not his natural mother.
But I brought him up as my own.

1260
02:30:18,662 --> 02:30:21,871
How did you find Shyam?

1261
02:30:23,501 --> 02:30:33,081
25 years ago, I traveled on
a pilgrimage with my husband.

1262
02:30:34,178 --> 02:30:40,823
One night, when we were out
visiting relatives...

1263
02:30:41,252 --> 02:30:47,225
We heard a baby crying. We found
a beautiful little baby abandoned.

1264
02:30:47,625 --> 02:30:55,009
He was wailing. But he was
dressed in fine fabrics.

1265
02:30:55,299 --> 02:30:59,611
Robbers had snatched his ornaments
and his earrings...

1266
02:30:59,970 --> 02:31:04,942
And they had left him all alone
in the jungle. I couldn't bear...

1267
02:31:05,242 --> 02:31:10,715
To see the baby crying.
I picked up the baby.

1268
02:31:12,783 --> 02:31:21,999
Soon afterwards, my husband
died of a heart attack.

1269
02:31:22,293 --> 02:31:24,693
There I was, all alone.
Without husband, without a child.

1270
02:31:36,140 --> 02:31:42,523
How could I have lived?
This child was a gift from God.

1271
02:31:42,780 --> 02:31:45,761
I came back to the village.
With the baby.

1272
02:31:46,083 --> 02:31:51,260
I brought him up as my own.

1273
02:31:51,555 --> 02:31:56,903
There was some talk about one
Raja Yeshwantrads twins...

1274
02:31:57,428 --> 02:31:59,840
A baby had been lost.

1275
02:32:00,164 --> 02:32:06,604
By then, I had begun to love
Shyam. I was attached to him.

1276
02:32:06,870 --> 02:32:14,789
The thought of losing him was
disturbing! So I just kept mum.

1277
02:32:15,112 --> 02:32:16,921
That's my crime.

1278
02:32:17,915 --> 02:32:22,295
So my guess is correct.
Ram and Shyam are twins.

1279
02:32:24,455 --> 02:32:32,169
Please! I beg of you!
Don't take my son away from me!

1280
02:32:32,463 --> 02:32:37,105
Lt'd kill me!

1281
02:32:37,401 --> 02:32:40,041
Nothing in the world
can separate us.

1282
02:32:41,805 --> 02:32:47,653
I may have been born of another.
But you gave me a mother's love.

1283
02:32:54,818 --> 02:33:00,461
Mother, I came to tell you that
I haven't cheated anyone.

1284
02:33:00,724 --> 02:33:02,226
I haven't killed anyone.

1285
02:33:02,559 --> 02:33:05,233
A helpless woman took me
for her brother.

1286
02:33:05,529 --> 02:33:12,174
An innocent girl stirred me.
I vowed I'd see them happy.

1287
02:33:12,469 --> 02:33:16,713
I have no love for money,
or wealth.

1288
02:33:17,041 --> 02:33:21,046
What I can earn with my two hands
is enough for me.

1289
02:33:21,312 --> 02:33:28,958
I'd rather die than do anything
that will give you a bad name.

1290
02:33:29,186 --> 02:33:33,157
Bless me, Mummy.

1291
02:33:33,490 --> 02:33:40,305
Till I have erased
the blot on my name...

1292
02:33:40,564 --> 02:33:43,170
Till I've done my duty as a son,
as a brother, as a human being...

1293
02:33:43,467 --> 02:33:46,107
Till I've avenged
my brother's death...

1294
02:33:46,537 --> 02:33:49,643
Till I've brought his assassin
to justice...

1295
02:33:49,940 --> 02:33:55,151
I'll parade him in public!

1296
02:33:55,546 --> 02:33:57,423
See you, Mother.

1297
02:34:00,551 --> 02:34:05,261
Won't you forgive me for what
I have done unknowingly?

1298
02:34:05,656 --> 02:34:11,766
Not your fault. I shouldn't
have concealed the truth.

1299
02:34:14,298 --> 02:34:19,372
I don't want to stay away
from you. Take me along.

1300
02:34:20,604 --> 02:34:26,486
I know your love is true.

1301
02:34:27,010 --> 02:34:35,430
I promise I will return to you.

1302
02:34:42,526 --> 02:34:46,269
Thank god I found you on time.
I have to tell you something.

1303
02:34:48,565 --> 02:34:51,045
Ram is alive!

1304
02:34:55,105 --> 02:34:58,917
My brother? Alive?
- What brother?

1305
02:34:59,176 --> 02:35:08,893
Later. Where is Ram?
- Gajendra is holding Ram.

1306
02:35:09,153 --> 02:35:13,329
And Shania.
They are locked up.

1307
02:35:13,524 --> 02:35:17,939
Gajendra wants to kill
them tonight.

1308
02:35:18,295 --> 02:35:24,371
Over my dead body!
Thanks for the news.

1309
02:35:26,236 --> 02:35:29,149
The police have cordoned off
the entire village.

1310
02:35:29,706 --> 02:35:31,947
They are crawling
all over the village.

1311
02:35:32,209 --> 02:35:35,782
Nothing on earth can stop me
from finding my brother.

1312
02:36:58,795 --> 02:37:02,504
I am not afraid of anyone!
I am not afraid of Gajendra!

1313
02:37:03,300 --> 02:37:07,942
I am not afraid of his whip!
I am not afraid of death!

1314
02:37:08,205 --> 02:37:11,015
In your love I have found
the strength to defy.

1315
02:37:11,475 --> 02:37:13,875
What have I given you in return?
I nearly killed you!

1316
02:37:17,147 --> 02:37:19,547
You mustn't say that.
I am fortunate...

1317
02:37:20,584 --> 02:37:30,028
My misfortune! That's what it is.
I'll do whatever Gajendra wants.

1318
02:37:30,327 --> 02:37:35,743
I'm ready to sign the papers.
Let him kill me. But not you.

1319
02:37:35,866 --> 02:37:37,846
You've done him no harm.

1320
02:37:38,168 --> 02:37:44,084
Do not worry, Ram. As long as
I'm alive, no one can touch you.

1321
02:37:55,285 --> 02:37:56,992
Shyam? You... here?

1322
02:37:58,922 --> 02:38:01,801
Thank God the two of you
are alive.

1323
02:38:02,125 --> 02:38:04,731
But they want to kill us.

1324
02:38:06,129 --> 02:38:08,529
We are brothers.
We were separated at birth.

1325
02:38:21,178 --> 02:38:27,060
God has brought us together
to vanquish the evil.

1326
02:38:42,966 --> 02:38:46,038
The devil is here. Now what do
we do?

1327
02:38:46,303 --> 02:38:51,719
Don't worry. Ram, you going to
have to do what I say.

1328
02:38:57,047 --> 02:39:00,290
What are you guys doing? Go bring
them down.

1329
02:39:00,584 --> 02:39:02,393
The decision is going to be made
today.

1330
02:40:07,117 --> 02:40:10,894
For the last time,
what do you want?

1331
02:40:11,088 --> 02:40:14,399
Say yes, and you live.
Say no and you die.

1332
02:40:16,560 --> 02:40:21,168
What can I say? You're holding
such a big revolver!

1333
02:40:21,531 --> 02:40:26,480
I guess I have to save my life.
- Then you will sign.

1334
02:40:27,404 --> 02:40:29,475
Write.

1335
02:40:31,675 --> 02:40:33,416
Whose name, sir?

1336
02:40:33,677 --> 02:40:37,022
Your name. Fast.
Or you're dead.

1337
02:40:38,682 --> 02:40:43,722
Please remove that. it's scary!
Look, I'm shivering.

1338
02:40:44,654 --> 02:40:46,156
Cowa rd

1339
02:41:07,944 --> 02:41:09,287
What have you written?

1340
02:41:10,247 --> 02:41:11,658
I wrote my name.

1341
02:41:12,549 --> 02:41:16,053
Are you joking? What's
your name, you moron?

1342
02:41:17,020 --> 02:41:20,433
My name is Shyam, and
you are the moron.

1343
02:41:20,690 --> 02:41:22,931
Look, there's Ram up there.

1344
02:41:51,688 --> 02:41:56,501
Don't fire at Shyam.
He's my twin!

1345
02:41:57,160 --> 02:42:00,607
Get him! Don't let him escape!

1346
02:42:06,336 --> 02:42:09,840
How long will you hide
in the shadows?

1347
02:42:10,340 --> 02:42:12,411
Are you coming out?
Or do I go in?

1348
02:42:30,493 --> 02:42:34,498
You killed my brother!

1349
02:42:34,764 --> 02:42:39,076
You want to join him?
I'll dispatch you!

1350
02:43:00,056 --> 02:43:04,129
Your time is up!

1351
02:43:07,430 --> 02:43:13,039
Has a rat ever killed a lion?

1352
02:44:15,565 --> 02:44:16,635
Great show!

1353
02:44:27,010 --> 02:44:33,518
I'm not afraid anymore!
Look who God has sent to help me.

1354
02:44:33,817 --> 02:44:36,627
My long-lost brother!
- Sent to me!

1355
02:44:36,886 --> 02:44:43,326
I'll get rid of the two of you!

1356
02:45:43,653 --> 02:45:51,037
Caught in your own web!
Only death can redeem you now.

1357
02:45:52,529 --> 02:45:56,341
They have all run away.
Let him go. Don't kill him.

1358
02:45:56,633 --> 02:46:04,552
He doesn't deserve mercy.
Your time is up. Start praying.

1359
02:46:04,841 --> 02:46:11,190
No! For heaven's sake!
Don't make your sister a widow!

1360
02:46:11,481 --> 02:46:15,793
Please! Let him go.
Forgive him!

1361
02:46:16,052 --> 02:46:23,698
Hear? The one you brutalized all
your life, is trying to save you.

1362
02:46:25,495 --> 02:46:31,639
We give a new life.
For the sake of our sister.

1363
02:46:50,687 --> 02:46:54,897
Look, how pretty
the brides are looking!

1364
02:46:58,194 --> 02:47:04,406
The brides have come.
Ram and Shyam will be here too.

1365
02:47:04,601 --> 02:47:06,512
I've lost face!

1366
02:47:06,836 --> 02:47:08,873
I'm fine where I am.

1367
02:47:09,205 --> 02:47:13,153
You should join in
the celebrations.

1368
02:47:19,015 --> 02:47:22,986
Here's my gift for them.

1369
02:47:32,328 --> 02:47:37,539
Congratulations, Mr. Rao.
- Congratulations, to you too.

1370
02:47:37,800 --> 02:47:40,371
Both your brothers
are getting married.

1371
02:47:42,472 --> 02:47:44,145
Where are the garlands?

1372
02:47:44,541 --> 02:47:50,822
First, where are the bridegrooms?

1373
02:48:04,928 --> 02:48:07,238
The garlands.

1374
02:48:14,037 --> 02:48:15,072
This one for Shyam.

1375
02:48:16,639 --> 02:48:18,414
This one for Ram.

1376
02:48:19,909 --> 02:48:24,915
But which is which?

1377
02:48:38,027 --> 02:48:43,409
Which one is Ram?
And... Shyam?

1378
02:48:43,600 --> 02:48:45,079
Which one are you?

1379
02:48:45,268 --> 02:48:46,542
And which one are you?

1380
02:48:47,971 --> 02:48:52,477
One of the two is yours.
The other one is yours.

1381
02:48:52,709 --> 02:48:57,658
So just go ahead and
take your pick.

1382
02:50:08,384 --> 02:50:11,763
Caught him!

1383
02:50:23,666 --> 02:50:25,577
Garlands for the brides too.

1384
02:50:44,954 --> 02:50:50,905
Go on, Shyam.
