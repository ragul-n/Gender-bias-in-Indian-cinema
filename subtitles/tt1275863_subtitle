62
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:59,811
The Heer Ranjha, LaiIa majnu and

63
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,213
They are onIy in stories

00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:06,315
They Iive separate in other worId

65
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:08,520
And then they find each other in
this worId

66
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:15,227
What the heII is this?
These things aIways confuse normaI peopIe

67
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,461

And your whoIe generation
couId'nt understand this..

239
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,365
Because you ve'nt heart..
aII God gave you brain..

00:33:39,484 --> 00:33:41,315
We had one dish in our menu card..

249
00:33:41,986 --> 00:33:43,248
Today there is so
many kinds for things..

250
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:46,287
So what's the probIem?
its good that we have options..

251
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:49,850
May be we were not habituaI of options..

252
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:52,521
In our time there was onIy a destitute..

253
00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:56,699
I had'nt any option that
I do Iove with her or not..

254
00:33:57,268 --> 00:33:58,758
ShouId I stop her or Iet her go..

255
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:02,329

now you are thinking to decide?

583
01:36:37,391 --> 01:36:39,757
2 years ago you had a break up

584
01:36:40,361 --> 01:36:43,194
then 1 year we Iive together
then we marry each other

585
01:36:43,564 --> 01:36:45,589
and the next day you are again
taIking about Jay

586
01:36:47,334 --> 01:36:48,323
it cant be good

587
01:36:48,969 --> 01:36:51,335
there is something wrong
that i have to correct

588
01:36:51,906 --> 01:36:54,704
there is something between me
and Jay

589
01:36:58,379 --> 01:37:00,247
there is something that stiII not went

590
01:37:00,247 --> 01:37:02,647

591
01:37:03,584 --> 01:37:05,449
by taIking if it becomes more
stronger than?

592
01:37:06,187 --> 01:37:07,677
then how can i Iive with you?

593
01:37:08,455 --> 01:37:09,888
then i have to Ieave

594
01:37:10,724 --> 01:37:12,248
What is this Meera?

595
01:37:12,660 --> 01:37:13,922
why are you doing this?

596
01:37:15,563 --> 01:37:19,329
I know i'm doing wrong with you.
I wiII say sorry to you

597
01:37:20,234 --> 01:37:23,533

601
01:37:43,591 --> 01:37:46,185
first I have to teII Meera

602
01:37:46,594 --> 01:37:48,357
she can understand what
is happenning with me?

603
01:37:51,232 --> 01:37:52,631
and you caII her

604
01:38:54,261 --> 01:38:55,751
you were aIways sure Meera

605
01:38:56,697 --> 01:39:00,189
I was thinking that if Meera is
saying than there is some chance

606
01:39:02,870 --> 01:39:06,306
Meera if you were not then
I give up

607
01:39:07,574 --> 01:39:11,840

who can aII things that
are best

614
01:45:47,908 --> 01:45:49,569

615
01:45:49,643 --> 01:45:54,239
Iots of professionaIs come from US
to discuss this probIem

616
