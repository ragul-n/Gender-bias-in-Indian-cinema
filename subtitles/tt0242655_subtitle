1
00:02:27,561 --> 00:02:29,529
Help! Help!

2
00:02:31,565 --> 00:02:33,590
Help! Help!

3
00:02:46,513 --> 00:02:47,571
Help!

4
00:03:51,912 --> 00:03:53,812
You saved me from death!

5
00:03:55,749 --> 00:03:56,807
Thank you very much for that!

6
00:03:59,452 --> 00:04:00,441
Thank God instead!

7
00:04:02,556 --> 00:04:04,285
Even you have become God for me.

8
00:04:04,824 --> 00:04:06,416
I have become... this
is a different thing.

9
00:04:07,427 --> 00:04:08,792
By the way I am a hunter.

10
00:04:10,664 --> 00:04:12,825
And... I am a Princess!

11
00:04:13,733 --> 00:04:14,791
Of which place?

12
00:04:15,135 --> 00:04:19,469
Err... of this side. And you?

13
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:23,607
Err... of this side!
- Oh!

14
00:04:23,677 --> 00:04:26,544
I see! So you had come here
for hunting. - Yeah!

15
00:04:26,613 --> 00:04:27,671
So... did you kill anything?

16
00:04:29,849 --> 00:04:31,146
What the hell did I kill?

17
00:04:32,152 --> 00:04:33,210
I was about to die.

18
00:04:33,787 --> 00:04:37,154
But someone was fortunate...
he was spared alive.

19
00:04:37,557 --> 00:04:38,615
What do you mean?

20
00:04:39,292 --> 00:04:41,590
Nothing! Your good name?

21
00:04:41,695 --> 00:04:45,563
Err... we don't have the
custom of keeping names.

22
00:04:47,167 --> 00:04:48,293
Well... you must be having a name?

23
00:04:48,802 --> 00:04:51,862
I do! But we don't have the
custom of telling our name.

24
00:04:52,205 --> 00:04:57,165
Oh! Err... but... how will I go now?

25
00:04:57,243 --> 00:04:58,301
Oh! So how you'll go?

26
00:04:59,579 --> 00:05:00,568
Saran!

27
00:05:05,485 --> 00:05:06,543
Please climb!

28
00:05:13,393 --> 00:05:14,451
Please come!

29
00:05:24,738 --> 00:05:26,137
'What a strange Princess! '

30
00:05:36,149 --> 00:05:37,616
Greetings, O King Bansidhar.

31
00:05:38,885 --> 00:05:40,477
Oh! Uddhav-ji!

32
00:05:40,854 --> 00:05:43,516
With the excuse of bringing the
gift of a devotee of Lord.

33
00:05:44,424 --> 00:05:45,891
I have come to pay homage to you.

34
00:05:46,793 --> 00:05:48,158
I didn't understand anything.

35
00:05:48,528 --> 00:05:51,588
At your majesty's service... Mr.
Vidhur has sent offering.

36
00:05:52,298 --> 00:05:55,563
Mr. Vidhur's offering taste
like Sudama's rice.

37
00:05:55,635 --> 00:05:58,433
Your majesty has immense
love for his devotees.

38
00:05:59,239 --> 00:06:00,228
Greetings, your majesty!

39
00:06:14,621 --> 00:06:15,679
Wait, my Lord!

40
00:06:16,489 --> 00:06:18,218
Do you want to eat it alone?

41
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:20,119
You have arrived at
good time, Rukmani.

42
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,718
Here! Taste it.

43
00:06:22,128 --> 00:06:23,823
Taste Mr. Vidhur's offering.

44
00:06:27,867 --> 00:06:29,664
Yummy! It's so delicious!

45
00:06:31,371 --> 00:06:34,738
Brother-in-law, offering
is shared and eaten.

46
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:38,336
Sister-in-law, only the lucky
ones get this offering.

47
00:06:38,812 --> 00:06:40,404
Yeah! Here! Take this! Take this!

48
00:06:42,148 --> 00:06:44,173
Delectable! It's very sweet!

49
00:06:44,751 --> 00:06:47,185
Uncle! Huh!

50
00:06:47,687 --> 00:06:49,154
You didn't wait for me at all?

51
00:06:49,322 --> 00:06:53,281
I see! Surekha, even you have
arrived at right time.

52
00:06:53,593 --> 00:06:54,753
Here! Take the offering.

53
00:06:57,297 --> 00:07:00,164
Ahaa! I never ate such sweet
offering before. Give me.

54
00:07:02,535 --> 00:07:04,264
Here! Take! Take! Eat more.

55
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:07,238
Yeah! I am very fortunate.

56
00:07:07,307 --> 00:07:10,105
I am spared alive to
eat this offering.

57
00:07:10,343 --> 00:07:11,401
Otherwise what would have happened?

58
00:07:11,778 --> 00:07:14,303
Otherwise? Otherwise
along with the chariot.

59
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,109
Even I would have fallen
in deep valley.

60
00:07:16,182 --> 00:07:17,547
And shattered to nothing!

61
00:07:18,651 --> 00:07:21,347
Luckily one youth saved me.

62
00:07:21,488 --> 00:07:22,580
Who was that young man?

63
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:25,485
Might be in his Kingdom...

64
00:07:27,427 --> 00:07:29,418
There prevails a custom of
not telling one's name.

65
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:31,825
Then that Kingdom must be very good!

66
00:07:32,665 --> 00:07:34,292
Even he was very good, uncle.

67
00:07:35,869 --> 00:07:38,337
Many such people arrive
in life, Surekha.

68
00:07:38,872 --> 00:07:42,171
By doing a favour they leave
their impact on our heart.

69
00:07:42,242 --> 00:07:43,300
Wait, Kanhaiyya!

70
00:07:43,676 --> 00:07:45,769
You want to gobble up your
brother's share too?

71
00:07:45,845 --> 00:07:48,245
Say that you reached on right time.

72
00:07:49,449 --> 00:07:50,848
Here. Take Mr. Vidhur's offering.

73
00:07:51,885 --> 00:07:53,819
Yes father, it's very luscious!

74
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,478
It is very delicious!

75
00:07:56,389 --> 00:07:57,447
What is this, brother?

76
00:07:57,657 --> 00:07:59,147
It is the invitation of
the fire veneration...

77
00:07:59,225 --> 00:08:00,214
...of the Pandava Kingdom.

78
00:08:00,393 --> 00:08:02,327
We both brothers are invited
to Indraprasth.

79
00:08:03,329 --> 00:08:04,421
I will surely go.

80
00:08:05,398 --> 00:08:06,729
No one has invited you.

81
00:08:07,834 --> 00:08:09,665
They must have forgotten
my name in a hurry.

82
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:12,099
To improve the mistake
of the Pandavas.

83
00:08:12,205 --> 00:08:14,196
I will have to go to Indraprasth.

84
00:08:14,374 --> 00:08:15,432
We will not take you along.

85
00:08:17,443 --> 00:08:19,104
Oh uncle! Uh-huh!

86
00:08:20,847 --> 00:08:22,508
Take her along, brother.

87
00:08:22,582 --> 00:08:24,641
It's not right to pamper
a girl, Kanhaiyya.

88
00:08:24,784 --> 00:08:26,217
She has to go to her in-laws
house in future.

89
00:08:26,386 --> 00:08:27,648
You are thinking about tomorrow?

90
00:08:27,854 --> 00:08:30,288
She wants to go to her in-laws
today itself! - Oh, oh!

91
00:08:31,825 --> 00:08:34,589
'Om, Swastihi.'

92
00:08:34,794 --> 00:08:38,286
'Om, Swastihi.'

93
00:08:38,431 --> 00:08:40,661
'Om, Swastihi.'
- Be alert!

94
00:08:40,867 --> 00:08:45,361
Son of Kauravas, King Duryodhan,
Uncle Shakuni.

95
00:08:45,438 --> 00:08:49,306
And King Shishupal are
presenting themselves!

96
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:53,145
What a pleasure! Welcome,
uncle Shakuni.

97
00:08:53,246 --> 00:08:54,338
Welcome, Duryodhan!

98
00:08:54,681 --> 00:08:56,148
Welcome, Mr. Shishupal!

99
00:08:56,316 --> 00:08:57,374
Please come!

100
00:09:00,386 --> 00:09:03,116
Please come, uncle. Please come.

101
00:09:03,756 --> 00:09:06,486
So everything is fine, Dusshashan!

102
00:09:07,727 --> 00:09:08,785
Have a seat, King.

103
00:09:11,331 --> 00:09:12,389
Have a seat, Duryodhan.

104
00:09:13,132 --> 00:09:14,463
Have a seat, uncle! Please sit.

105
00:09:15,101 --> 00:09:18,161
Dharam Raj, the Om veneration
is over now.

106
00:09:18,805 --> 00:09:20,102
For the main veneration.

107
00:09:20,506 --> 00:09:22,406
Chose some capable person.

108
00:09:23,343 --> 00:09:26,710
Yudhisthir-ji, Dwaarkadhish-ji
didn't come yet.

109
00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:29,213
Lord Kanhaiyya!
- Live long!

110
00:09:33,853 --> 00:09:35,115
I am so fortunate!

111
00:09:35,255 --> 00:09:38,656
Today I am very glad to
see my brothers here.

112
00:09:39,459 --> 00:09:41,120
Where is Dharam Raj, Subhadra?

113
00:09:41,461 --> 00:09:43,190
He is waiting for you, brother.

114
00:09:46,599 --> 00:09:48,123
Surekha, please come.

115
00:09:56,876 --> 00:09:58,309
Here is your reward.

116
00:09:58,811 --> 00:10:01,143
Feed liquor to the elephant
and let it go mad!

117
00:10:01,614 --> 00:10:03,241
You don't worry at all.

118
00:10:05,251 --> 00:10:09,153
Tonight there will be a dance
ceremony at Pandava palace.

119
00:10:09,289 --> 00:10:11,154
And even Krishna will
be present in it.

120
00:10:11,424 --> 00:10:15,155
So along with the dance; even
Krishna should be finished!

121
00:10:18,831 --> 00:10:19,889
Tell me, Dharam Raj.

122
00:10:20,433 --> 00:10:21,764
All the five Pandavas
are happy. Right?

123
00:10:22,268 --> 00:10:23,826
More than paying homage to Keshav.

124
00:10:24,203 --> 00:10:26,501
What else can be a bigger
happiness for Pandavas?

125
00:10:26,873 --> 00:10:28,170
Please come!

126
00:10:41,321 --> 00:10:44,313
Please have a seat, Balrama-ji.
Please sit.

127
00:10:46,492 --> 00:10:47,686
Not here, Lord Keshav.

128
00:10:47,827 --> 00:10:50,295
Your place is there. Please come.

129
00:11:00,206 --> 00:11:03,471
We have decided to offer the
main veneration by you.

130
00:11:03,543 --> 00:11:06,307
Not a decision, you
have done injustice!

131
00:11:06,479 --> 00:11:07,537
What do you mean?

132
00:11:07,613 --> 00:11:09,342
Change your decision, Yudhisthir.

133
00:11:09,482 --> 00:11:11,746
This decision will not
change, Shishupal!

134
00:11:12,151 --> 00:11:14,847
Then we'll be forced to
take some other decision.

135
00:11:15,254 --> 00:11:17,688
None of your decisions will
have any effect on Pandavas.

136
00:11:18,224 --> 00:11:20,283
If the veneration will be
offered by Shree Krishna.

137
00:11:21,828 --> 00:11:24,194
You should be a devotee
of Krishna, Arjun.

138
00:11:24,664 --> 00:11:26,222
Hiding from Baldev after all.

139
00:11:26,299 --> 00:11:29,427
He made his sister Subhadra
elope with you.

140
00:11:29,502 --> 00:11:30,696
Shishupal!
- Huh!

141
00:11:31,604 --> 00:11:34,767
Scholar like Drone, valour
like uncle Shakuni.

142
00:11:35,341 --> 00:11:39,437
And in the presence of royal
King like Lord Duryodhan.

143
00:11:40,179 --> 00:11:42,875
You have given the honour of
veneration to this shepherd!?

144
00:11:43,349 --> 00:11:44,782
I can never bear this.

145
00:11:45,184 --> 00:11:46,708
Shishupal is right!

146
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,720
Yes! I am not a shepherd like you.

147
00:11:50,189 --> 00:11:52,180
I am from a royal origin.
From a respectable family!

148
00:11:52,492 --> 00:11:54,653
But you are bad at heart!

149
00:11:54,727 --> 00:11:55,785
Shut up!

150
00:11:55,862 --> 00:11:58,353
You are a sinful man who
dances among young girls.

151
00:11:58,765 --> 00:12:01,598
Dance and song doesn't exist
in the life of animals.

152
00:12:01,734 --> 00:12:02,826
What did you call me? A beast!?

153
00:12:03,569 --> 00:12:05,799
Krishna, I will drink your blood!

154
00:12:06,139 --> 00:12:09,131
Now there is no doubt
that you are a beast!

155
00:12:09,342 --> 00:12:11,742
Today I'll definitely behave
like a beast with you.

156
00:12:12,812 --> 00:12:16,680
Royal gathering has already got
the proof of your wildness.

157
00:12:16,749 --> 00:12:19,547
Keshav, more silence
becomes cowardice!

158
00:12:20,153 --> 00:12:23,418
Before the arrival of storm;
the breeze calm down, Arjun.

159
00:12:24,157 --> 00:12:27,149
I have promised my aunt, that
is Shishupal's mother.

160
00:12:27,226 --> 00:12:30,161
That I will forgive his 100 crimes.

161
00:12:30,229 --> 00:12:31,287
You are hiding your cowardliness...

162
00:12:31,364 --> 00:12:32,422
...with the excuse of the promise.

163
00:12:33,199 --> 00:12:37,226
I am counting the words
said by you as crimes.

164
00:12:38,237 --> 00:12:39,329
That too from that time.

165
00:12:39,772 --> 00:12:42,798
In my absence when you
set fire in Dwaarka.

166
00:12:43,543 --> 00:12:46,171
You cheating killed poor Bhojraj
at Renve mountain...

167
00:12:46,245 --> 00:12:47,769
...While he was observing austerity.

168
00:12:48,548 --> 00:12:50,539
My horse of Ashwamedh veneration.

169
00:12:50,616 --> 00:12:52,584
You stole it before
the fire veneration.

170
00:12:53,219 --> 00:12:56,313
You forcefully kidnap priest
Pakdun's wife on the way.

171
00:12:56,689 --> 00:12:59,590
You deceitfully made Vishali Raj's
daughter elope with you.

172
00:12:59,792 --> 00:13:01,760
Today I'll thrash you and make
you also run from here!

173
00:13:02,128 --> 00:13:04,323
You yourself think
to run, Shishupal.

174
00:13:04,797 --> 00:13:08,426
From your 100 crimes; only
10 crimes are left.

175
00:13:08,835 --> 00:13:10,132
You are purposely hindering...

176
00:13:10,203 --> 00:13:12,262
...The auspicious work of Pandavas,
Shishupal.

177
00:13:12,572 --> 00:13:15,803
Grandfather, in the greed
of delicacies of Pandavas.

178
00:13:16,242 --> 00:13:17,834
Even your mouth has
started watering?

179
00:13:18,478 --> 00:13:21,345
And flowers are shedding
from Shishupal's mouth.

180
00:13:21,581 --> 00:13:23,811
Fire balls emerge from the mouth
of brave ones, coward!

181
00:13:24,617 --> 00:13:27,484
So this means a funeral
is burning in your heart?

182
00:13:27,687 --> 00:13:30,417
It will cool down only after
burning and killing you!

183
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:35,827
Now only 5 crimes of yours
are left over, Shishupal.

184
00:13:36,329 --> 00:13:38,456
What are you counting on
your finger tips, coward?

185
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:40,392
If you are a male then confront me!

186
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:44,158
Barking dogs seldom bite!

187
00:13:44,537 --> 00:13:46,869
And when they do; they
strike a terror!

188
00:13:47,373 --> 00:13:48,431
See its result!

189
00:13:51,844 --> 00:13:53,277
Abhimanyu!
- Abhimanyu!

190
00:13:53,646 --> 00:13:56,809
Shishupal, don't forget that
Shree Krishna is my uncle.

191
00:13:58,184 --> 00:14:02,644
Oh! Abhimanyu's intervening
like this... it's not good!

192
00:14:03,389 --> 00:14:05,448
You are right, uncle Shakuni.

193
00:14:06,626 --> 00:14:08,560
Abhimanyu, sit down.

194
00:14:09,495 --> 00:14:11,759
Shishupal is going to
die with my hands.

195
00:14:12,832 --> 00:14:14,231
Coward! Deceit fellow!

196
00:14:15,134 --> 00:14:17,364
Forget your fake pride and
take a sword in your hand.

197
00:14:17,803 --> 00:14:19,634
If you are Yashoda's
son then confront me!

198
00:14:21,307 --> 00:14:22,535
What are you waiting for, Kanhaiyya?

199
00:14:23,409 --> 00:14:25,843
His 3 crimes are still
remaining, brother.

200
00:14:27,146 --> 00:14:29,376
Shishupal, control yourself yet.

201
00:14:29,448 --> 00:14:30,676
You control yourself!

202
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,344
Coward! Deceit! Shameless!

203
00:14:32,485 --> 00:14:36,216
Shishupal! Your 3 crimes
are completed.

204
00:14:36,489 --> 00:14:37,786
I am free from the promise.

205
00:14:38,624 --> 00:14:41,593
Beware! Now there is no one
to save you in the 3 worlds!

206
00:14:56,509 --> 00:14:57,806
Omigosh! No! Hey please save me!

207
00:15:10,223 --> 00:15:13,750
Help! Help! Help! Help!

208
00:15:15,261 --> 00:15:19,254
Help!
- Help!!! Aaah!!

209
00:15:19,498 --> 00:15:22,399
Shree Krishna Chandra!
- Live long!

210
00:15:22,735 --> 00:15:25,602
Shree Krishna Chandra!
- Live long!

211
00:15:25,671 --> 00:15:28,299
Shree Krishna Chandra!
- Live long!

212
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:51,594
Go, go, O deceiver, Kanhaiyaa!

213
00:15:51,664 --> 00:15:54,531
Go, go, O deceiver!

214
00:15:55,434 --> 00:15:57,425
What magic have you done?

215
00:15:57,503 --> 00:15:59,471
You won over my heart.

216
00:15:59,605 --> 00:16:03,701
You played such flute.

217
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:08,744
Go, go, O deceiver, Kanhaiyaa!

218
00:16:08,814 --> 00:16:11,783
Go, go, O deceiver!

219
00:16:24,263 --> 00:16:28,222
There was darkness and high tide.

220
00:16:30,503 --> 00:16:34,405
There was darkness and high tide.

221
00:16:34,607 --> 00:16:37,770
It was difficult to move ahead.

222
00:16:38,844 --> 00:16:42,803
Clouds thundered; Yamuna
raged with tide.

223
00:16:42,882 --> 00:16:46,147
Father really panicked.

224
00:16:51,424 --> 00:16:55,417
Feet touched and showed a way.

225
00:17:08,107 --> 00:17:11,770
Feet touched and showed a way.

226
00:17:11,844 --> 00:17:15,473
How is this miracle?

227
00:17:16,182 --> 00:17:20,414
Go, go, O deceiver, Kanhaiyaa!

228
00:17:20,486 --> 00:17:23,421
Go, go, O deceiver!

229
00:17:23,856 --> 00:17:25,847
What magic have you done?

230
00:17:26,192 --> 00:17:28,126
You won over my heart.

231
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:32,253
You played such flute.

232
00:17:32,765 --> 00:17:37,134
Go, go, O deceiver, Kanhaiyaa!

233
00:17:37,203 --> 00:17:40,263
Go, go, O deceiver!

234
00:17:45,811 --> 00:17:49,747
Snatching the child;
that proud man.

235
00:17:49,815 --> 00:17:53,148
He tried to kill him on the spot.

236
00:17:58,224 --> 00:18:02,183
Listening to the voice
of fire Goddess.

237
00:18:02,361 --> 00:18:05,762
Kans got scared hearing it.

238
00:18:14,807 --> 00:18:19,176
No one knows the game
of Nach Nagar.

239
00:18:19,245 --> 00:18:22,806
No one knows the game
of Nach Nagar.

240
00:18:22,882 --> 00:18:26,511
The world is really foolish.

241
00:18:27,186 --> 00:18:31,316
Go, go, O deceiver, Kanhaiyaa!

242
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:34,518
Go, go, O deceiver!

243
00:18:44,136 --> 00:18:51,133
The day you ate mud; you
showed a new miracle.

244
00:18:52,378 --> 00:18:59,477
The day you ate mud; you
showed a new miracle.

245
00:19:03,823 --> 00:19:07,725
Seeing the 3 worlds in it.

246
00:19:08,093 --> 00:19:11,085
Mother Yashoda was shocked.

247
00:19:12,264 --> 00:19:16,291
Your childhood is enchanting.

248
00:19:16,368 --> 00:19:20,168
Your childhood is enchanting.

249
00:19:20,239 --> 00:19:23,606
Your face is dark complexioned.

250
00:19:24,243 --> 00:19:28,441
Go, go, O deceiver, Kanhaiyaa!

251
00:19:28,514 --> 00:19:31,347
Go, go, O deceiver!

252
00:19:41,427 --> 00:19:48,356
The folks of Gokul were
harassed by snakes.

253
00:19:51,403 --> 00:19:55,362
Nag Nath jumped in the sea.

254
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:58,768
Child Krishna Murari.

255
00:20:23,402 --> 00:20:27,270
In the protection of his devotees.

256
00:20:27,506 --> 00:20:31,272
In the protection of his devotees.

257
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:34,777
Your form was incomparable.

258
00:20:35,447 --> 00:20:39,611
Go, go, O deceiver, Kanhaiyaa!

259
00:20:39,685 --> 00:20:42,449
Go, go, O deceiver!

260
00:20:44,189 --> 00:20:51,493
Mohan went and challenged
unjust Kans.

261
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:14,776
By finishing off the
sin of this world.

262
00:21:14,853 --> 00:21:17,879
Lord Krishna got
rid of the burden.

263
00:21:18,691 --> 00:21:21,558
Go, go, O deceiver!

264
00:22:20,486 --> 00:22:23,512
Stop, elephant! Calm down!

265
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:25,850
Elephant, calm down!

266
00:22:34,533 --> 00:22:36,626
Shri Abhimanyu!
- Live long!

267
00:22:36,702 --> 00:22:38,693
Shri Abhimanyu!
- Live long!

268
00:22:38,771 --> 00:22:40,705
Shri Abhimanyu!
- Live long!

269
00:22:40,773 --> 00:22:42,400
Shri Abhimanyu!
- Live long!

270
00:23:04,863 --> 00:23:07,730
You!? Hunter?

271
00:23:09,201 --> 00:23:10,259
Princess!

272
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:13,262
Today I have come to know your name.

273
00:23:13,739 --> 00:23:14,797
Really?

274
00:23:14,873 --> 00:23:17,398
Do they speak lie also
at your Kingdom?

275
00:23:17,643 --> 00:23:20,134
Lies? Sometimes!

276
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:21,337
Surekha!

277
00:23:22,581 --> 00:23:24,481
Aunt is arriving. I am going.

278
00:23:25,684 --> 00:23:28,152
Might be there is a custom of
telling lies at your place too.

279
00:23:28,487 --> 00:23:29,545
Sometimes!

280
00:23:47,773 --> 00:23:51,368
Dharam Raj, now we want
to return to Hastinapur.

281
00:23:51,443 --> 00:23:52,910
What's the great hurry, Duryodhan?

282
00:23:53,278 --> 00:23:55,178
You have just arrived and
you want to go so soon?

283
00:23:55,547 --> 00:23:56,605
Inspite of being a family member.

284
00:23:56,682 --> 00:23:58,240
You behave like guests?

285
00:23:58,517 --> 00:24:01,577
Father, the Maya palace is ready.

286
00:24:01,653 --> 00:24:05,214
It is ready? Then show that palace
to your uncle too, dear.

287
00:24:05,758 --> 00:24:08,226
Come, uncle! Please come, uncle.

288
00:24:16,435 --> 00:24:19,199
Uncle, this is that Maya Palace.

289
00:24:19,738 --> 00:24:22,605
Fantastic! It's such
a beautiful palace!

290
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:24,732
I am taken over by this sight.

291
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:29,144
Excellent! The one who got it
made and one who made it.

292
00:24:29,214 --> 00:24:30,841
Both are worthy of praise.

293
00:24:32,684 --> 00:24:34,208
Please come.
- Oh yes, yes!

294
00:24:52,171 --> 00:24:53,229
What's the matter, uncle?

295
00:24:53,438 --> 00:24:54,700
Just see... the water is pouring!

296
00:24:55,908 --> 00:24:57,170
This is not water.

297
00:24:57,442 --> 00:24:58,807
This is Maya's miracle!

298
00:24:59,378 --> 00:25:00,367
Just look!

299
00:25:17,129 --> 00:25:18,255
Uncle!
- Yes?

300
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:19,456
Your clothes are not drenched?

301
00:25:19,865 --> 00:25:22,390
Even your clothes are
not drenched, nephew!

302
00:25:23,402 --> 00:25:24,562
What a strange downpour!
- What a strange downpour!

303
00:25:28,373 --> 00:25:32,173
Huh? Hey? Uncle, the
downpour has stopped!

304
00:25:33,545 --> 00:25:35,513
What have you seen yet?

305
00:25:35,781 --> 00:25:36,839
Come here!

306
00:25:46,758 --> 00:25:47,816
Now see this.

307
00:26:40,412 --> 00:26:45,440
The more you praise this
Maya palace. It's less.

308
00:26:45,517 --> 00:26:46,609
Why, Suyodhan?

309
00:26:47,286 --> 00:26:48,685
You are right, uncle.

310
00:26:56,328 --> 00:26:58,228
Now walk carefully, uncle.

311
00:26:58,497 --> 00:26:59,691
I won't tell anything.

312
00:26:59,765 --> 00:27:01,562
What's the need to tell, nephew?

313
00:27:01,633 --> 00:27:03,100
I have understood everything.

314
00:27:03,402 --> 00:27:04,630
I won't be deceived now.

315
00:27:05,103 --> 00:27:06,161
Okay fine. Come on.

316
00:27:12,511 --> 00:27:13,569
Come on. Please come.

317
00:27:19,284 --> 00:27:21,275
Why did you stop, uncle?
- What if we burn?

318
00:27:21,753 --> 00:27:23,220
Why, uncle? Just look!

319
00:27:25,457 --> 00:27:29,723
Don't worry! Even this is the
miracle of Maya. Nothing else!

320
00:27:30,529 --> 00:27:31,587
Look at this!

321
00:27:34,266 --> 00:27:35,858
At least now you don't have
the fear of getting burned.

322
00:27:36,735 --> 00:27:37,793
Please come.

323
00:28:17,642 --> 00:28:20,110
Brother-in-law, so did you
see the Maya Palace?

324
00:28:20,579 --> 00:28:24,515
I am doubtful. Are you
all magical too?

325
00:28:26,651 --> 00:28:28,642
Your guess is not wrong,
brother-in-law.

326
00:28:29,221 --> 00:28:30,552
A female is the form
of Maya in this.

327
00:28:31,123 --> 00:28:32,215
Look carefully!

328
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:33,814
Getting entrapped by a female.

329
00:28:34,292 --> 00:28:36,419
A man can't even see Inspite
of having eyesight, bhabi.

330
00:28:44,236 --> 00:28:45,794
Sons of blind are blind themselves.

331
00:28:46,471 --> 00:28:47,529
Panchali!!!

332
00:28:50,475 --> 00:28:53,467
Laughter becomes a mourn after
it goes beyond limit.

333
00:28:53,612 --> 00:28:54,806
Did you feel bad, Duryodhan?

334
00:28:55,414 --> 00:28:56,745
I was just joking.

335
00:28:57,516 --> 00:28:59,416
It has hurt my feelings, Panchali!

336
00:28:59,751 --> 00:29:02,618
Remember this! Sons of a
blind man are not blind!

337
00:29:03,088 --> 00:29:04,453
You'll believe this thing.

338
00:29:04,823 --> 00:29:06,688
When I'll take the revenge
of my insult.

339
00:29:07,192 --> 00:29:09,387
And inspite of being
in front of you.

340
00:29:09,461 --> 00:29:10,723
The ones with eyes will be blind!

341
00:29:11,263 --> 00:29:14,699
Being your sister-in-law,
I uttered this thing.

342
00:29:15,133 --> 00:29:18,694
This is called to slap and then
to be affectionate, Duryodhan.

343
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:20,101
Uncle, why are you arousing enmity...

344
00:29:20,172 --> 00:29:23,539
...between brother-in-law
and sister-in-law?

345
00:29:23,608 --> 00:29:27,271
Huh! There is no need for me
to arouse enmity, Panchali.

346
00:29:27,446 --> 00:29:31,109
Here Suyodhan is insulted; not me.

347
00:29:31,416 --> 00:29:32,474
Why, Suyodhan?

348
00:29:32,784 --> 00:29:34,115
You are right, uncle!

349
00:29:34,653 --> 00:29:36,382
Now between Kauravs and Pandavas.

350
00:29:36,455 --> 00:29:37,820
There will be only
a relation of war!

351
00:29:41,393 --> 00:29:43,486
Duryodhan! Listen to me, Duryodhan!

352
00:29:44,296 --> 00:29:45,354
Duryodhan!!!

353
00:30:07,619 --> 00:30:09,143
Excellent!
- Superb! - Perfect aim!

354
00:30:09,221 --> 00:30:10,347
Mind blowing!
- Fantastic! - Well aimed!

355
00:30:10,422 --> 00:30:11,514
Superb!
- Excellent!

356
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:13,248
But the arrow is in your hand?

357
00:30:13,558 --> 00:30:15,253
Then who shot the fruit?
- I!

358
00:30:17,295 --> 00:30:18,694
Goodness me! Prince Abhimanyu!

359
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:19,888
Come on. Let's go.

360
00:30:20,832 --> 00:30:21,890
You!?

361
00:30:22,767 --> 00:30:24,496
But... why have you come here?

362
00:30:27,239 --> 00:30:28,638
If I had not arrived here.

363
00:30:29,241 --> 00:30:32,642
You must have killed that
maid in one shot.

364
00:30:32,711 --> 00:30:35,179
I never miss my aim.

365
00:30:35,914 --> 00:30:37,245
I have experienced it.

366
00:30:37,315 --> 00:30:38,407
How?

367
00:30:38,683 --> 00:30:41,174
That day the garland you threw.

368
00:30:41,553 --> 00:30:43,384
It had landed exactly
around my neck.

369
00:30:43,855 --> 00:30:47,347
That... that had slipped
from my hands suddenly.

370
00:30:47,859 --> 00:30:48,917
How suddenly?

371
00:30:49,728 --> 00:30:51,787
Just like we met suddenly
in the forest.

372
00:30:52,264 --> 00:30:54,255
And you had run away with my horse.

373
00:30:54,332 --> 00:30:57,529
Hey no, no, no! In fact
the horse fled with me.

374
00:30:57,602 --> 00:31:00,196
How?
- Like this!

375
00:31:12,784 --> 00:31:16,242
You reside in my eyes.

376
00:31:16,488 --> 00:31:19,150
Don't steal my heart.

377
00:31:19,224 --> 00:31:22,625
This is the theft of love.

378
00:31:22,694 --> 00:31:25,219
Hide me in your heart.

379
00:31:25,297 --> 00:31:28,698
You reside in my eyes.

380
00:31:28,767 --> 00:31:31,327
Don't steal my heart.

381
00:31:31,403 --> 00:31:34,895
This is the theft of love.

382
00:31:34,973 --> 00:31:37,703
Hide me in your heart.

383
00:31:50,889 --> 00:31:54,689
Neither I know the thieves.

384
00:31:54,926 --> 00:31:58,692
Nor I ever recognised any thief.

385
00:32:03,235 --> 00:32:06,796
Neither I know the thieves.

386
00:32:07,272 --> 00:32:10,730
Nor I ever recognised any thief.

387
00:32:11,376 --> 00:32:15,142
When the strangers meet.

388
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:18,816
They become dear ones.

389
00:32:18,883 --> 00:32:22,842
Beloved, they become dear ones.

390
00:32:23,488 --> 00:32:26,685
The relation that is bonded today.

391
00:32:27,158 --> 00:32:29,626
Don't forget it tomorrow.

392
00:32:29,694 --> 00:32:33,255
You reside in my eyes.

393
00:32:33,331 --> 00:32:35,765
Don't steal my heart.

394
00:32:35,834 --> 00:32:39,361
This is the theft of love.

395
00:32:39,437 --> 00:32:42,167
Hide me in your heart.

396
00:32:55,253 --> 00:32:58,916
From the time these
eyes became shy.

397
00:32:59,424 --> 00:33:03,121
Heart is swaying with happiness.

398
00:33:07,432 --> 00:33:11,129
From the time these
eyes became shy.

399
00:33:11,469 --> 00:33:14,836
Heart is swaying with happiness.

400
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,240
You have settled in my eyes.

401
00:33:19,544 --> 00:33:22,775
My love is blossoming with smile.

402
00:33:22,847 --> 00:33:26,806
Beloved, my love is blossoming
with smile.

403
00:33:27,419 --> 00:33:29,512
With a smile.

404
00:33:29,587 --> 00:33:33,546
Take over my heart.

405
00:33:33,625 --> 00:33:37,152
You reside in my eyes.

406
00:33:37,228 --> 00:33:39,594
Don't steal my heart.

407
00:33:39,664 --> 00:33:43,191
This is the theft of love.

408
00:33:43,268 --> 00:33:45,759
Hide me in your heart.

409
00:33:58,883 --> 00:34:00,748
From the time you met me.

410
00:34:00,819 --> 00:34:02,582
My heart is desperate.

411
00:34:02,787 --> 00:34:06,587
There is uneasiness
in heart and body.

412
00:34:10,862 --> 00:34:12,796
From the time you met me.

413
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:14,559
My heart is desperate.

414
00:34:14,799 --> 00:34:18,394
There is uneasiness
in heart and body.

415
00:34:18,803 --> 00:34:22,637
You are desperate and
I am desperate.

416
00:34:22,874 --> 00:34:26,366
The breeze says;
come on let's fly.

417
00:34:26,444 --> 00:34:30,608
Beloved, the breeze says;
come on let's fly.

418
00:34:30,849 --> 00:34:34,444
If you are willing
to come with me.

419
00:34:34,519 --> 00:34:36,851
Beloved, be loyal.

420
00:34:36,921 --> 00:34:40,448
You reside in my eyes.

421
00:34:40,525 --> 00:34:43,153
Don't steal my heart.

422
00:34:43,228 --> 00:34:46,425
This is the theft of love.

423
00:34:46,498 --> 00:34:49,399
Hide me in your heart.

424
00:35:01,346 --> 00:35:02,404
Duryodhan's unhappiness.

425
00:35:03,848 --> 00:35:05,406
It is a sad thing for us.

426
00:35:06,184 --> 00:35:07,708
Staying along with uncle Shakuni.

427
00:35:07,786 --> 00:35:09,219
And getting angry over
every small matter.

428
00:35:09,287 --> 00:35:10,811
It is but natural for Duryodhan,
Dharam Raj.

429
00:35:11,356 --> 00:35:12,414
Brother!

430
00:35:15,326 --> 00:35:16,384
What's the matter, Subhadra?

431
00:35:18,463 --> 00:35:19,521
Are you aware?

432
00:35:19,798 --> 00:35:21,595
Surekha has reached
her age of marriage.

433
00:35:21,666 --> 00:35:23,566
Have you searched any groom for her?

434
00:35:23,635 --> 00:35:24,693
Yes, brother.

435
00:35:25,236 --> 00:35:28,603
Surekha and Abhimanyu have
become much attached.

436
00:35:29,541 --> 00:35:31,236
The pair will be perfect!

437
00:35:31,376 --> 00:35:33,571
Keshav said what I wanted to say.

438
00:35:34,279 --> 00:35:35,644
What is your wish, Parth?

439
00:35:37,148 --> 00:35:39,673
Keshav is always the well
wisher of Pandavas.

440
00:35:41,152 --> 00:35:42,449
What is your wish, brother?

441
00:35:42,821 --> 00:35:44,152
Whatever you wish!

442
00:35:44,222 --> 00:35:46,156
Then the engagement should
take place immediately!

443
00:35:46,224 --> 00:35:49,387
Yes, Keshav! The auspicious
thing shouldn't be delayed.

444
00:35:49,694 --> 00:35:52,458
We should distribute sweet balls
for this good news too!

445
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:54,760
You are always greedy to eat.

446
00:35:58,503 --> 00:35:59,629
Be alert!

447
00:35:59,704 --> 00:36:03,105
Eldest of the Pandavas,
Dharam Raj Yudhisthir.

448
00:36:03,441 --> 00:36:07,639
From the family of Indraprasth
is presenting himself!

449
00:36:18,656 --> 00:36:19,714
Welcome, respective King!

450
00:36:19,791 --> 00:36:23,318
Duryodhan, you must be surprised
to see us here.

451
00:36:23,495 --> 00:36:24,757
In fact I am very happy.

452
00:36:25,763 --> 00:36:28,129
Since you became angry
and came here.

453
00:36:28,633 --> 00:36:31,568
Panchali insisted on
coming here daily.

454
00:36:31,636 --> 00:36:34,127
This means my anger
became my good luck!

455
00:36:35,273 --> 00:36:36,331
Did you hear, Panchali?

456
00:36:36,741 --> 00:36:39,141
For how long is brother-in-law
and bhabi's quarrel?

457
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:40,536
You are right.

458
00:36:40,879 --> 00:36:42,141
Please come.

459
00:36:42,213 --> 00:36:43,510
Come, Panchali! Come!

460
00:36:59,163 --> 00:37:00,152
Greetings, uncle!

461
00:37:00,431 --> 00:37:01,489
Live long!

462
00:37:08,773 --> 00:37:13,107
Hey fantastic! My best
friend is present here.

463
00:37:13,177 --> 00:37:15,270
Why, uncle?
- I understood! I understood!

464
00:37:15,513 --> 00:37:18,107
First rest awhile, Dharam Raj.

465
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:21,314
To take rest only we have
come to Hastinapur, uncle.

466
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:25,250
We have made full arrangement
for your rest.

467
00:37:25,657 --> 00:37:26,715
Why, Dusshasan?

468
00:37:26,791 --> 00:37:27,815
It is absolutely right, brother.

469
00:37:28,126 --> 00:37:30,185
First have some breakfast.

470
00:37:30,428 --> 00:37:31,827
Talk about family matters.

471
00:37:31,896 --> 00:37:33,124
Then we'll play tomorrow.

472
00:37:33,197 --> 00:37:35,757
All right. Fine. Tomorrow's fine!

473
00:37:38,169 --> 00:37:41,138
By the way even I am
an expert player.

474
00:37:43,308 --> 00:37:44,366
Here, I have defeated you.

475
00:37:44,442 --> 00:37:45,602
Bravo, uncle! Excellent!

476
00:37:47,812 --> 00:37:49,439
I had forbidden before itself.

477
00:37:49,681 --> 00:37:50,773
But you didn't agree after all.

478
00:37:51,449 --> 00:37:52,507
Tell me, Dharam Raj.

479
00:37:53,217 --> 00:37:54,616
What do you bet now?

480
00:37:55,153 --> 00:37:58,145
I have lost my Kingdom, crown,
wealth and treasure! Everything!

481
00:37:58,323 --> 00:37:59,381
What should I bet now?

482
00:38:00,725 --> 00:38:03,626
He is called a player
who bets on himself!

483
00:38:04,362 --> 00:38:06,455
Even I bet on myself!

484
00:38:07,198 --> 00:38:10,258
And... these 4 brothers?

485
00:38:12,837 --> 00:38:15,362
I bet them along with me.

486
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,205
Throw the dice, uncle!

487
00:38:20,845 --> 00:38:24,576
That's it! 3! One, two, three!

488
00:38:27,752 --> 00:38:29,481
We have won this game too!

489
00:38:29,787 --> 00:38:31,721
Uncle Shakuni!
- Live long!

490
00:38:31,789 --> 00:38:33,780
Uncle Shakuni!
- Live long!

491
00:38:35,259 --> 00:38:36,317
Surrender yourself!

492
00:38:37,261 --> 00:38:39,126
Remove your royal crown, Dharam Raj.

493
00:38:45,803 --> 00:38:48,363
Tell me, Yudhisthir.
What do you bet now?

494
00:38:48,673 --> 00:38:50,573
Now what is left out with us!?

495
00:38:53,711 --> 00:38:56,475
Uncle... Panchali!

496
00:38:58,383 --> 00:39:02,376
Err... Draupadi is still
left, Dharam Raj!

497
00:39:02,553 --> 00:39:03,611
Shut up!!!

498
00:39:04,088 --> 00:39:05,555
If you'll take Draupadi's name.

499
00:39:05,823 --> 00:39:07,586
I'll strangle your neck!

500
00:39:07,725 --> 00:39:10,285
Bhim! You are a slave
of Kauravas from today.

501
00:39:11,095 --> 00:39:12,494
Duryodhan is right, Bhim.

502
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:14,359
Believe me, Dharam Raj.

503
00:39:14,832 --> 00:39:16,390
The one who loses first.

504
00:39:16,801 --> 00:39:18,530
He is the winner in the end.

505
00:39:19,404 --> 00:39:24,103
By betting on Draupadi, you
can win back your everything.

506
00:39:24,242 --> 00:39:26,107
This is not gambling;
but a terrible thing!

507
00:39:26,444 --> 00:39:28,309
This is a game of
defeat and victory.

508
00:39:28,546 --> 00:39:29,638
Err... why, Yudhisthir?

509
00:39:30,281 --> 00:39:31,407
Throw the dice!

510
00:39:35,553 --> 00:39:36,713
That's it! We won!

511
00:39:37,121 --> 00:39:39,487
Uncle Shakuni!
- Live long!

512
00:39:39,557 --> 00:39:41,525
Uncle Shakuni!
- Live long!

513
00:39:43,461 --> 00:39:46,624
Dusshasan, take full revenge
of your insult.

514
00:39:47,365 --> 00:39:49,856
Drag that haughty Panchali here!

515
00:39:50,368 --> 00:39:53,394
Dusshasan, if you'll dare
to touch Panchali.

516
00:39:53,705 --> 00:39:55,195
I'll break your hands.

517
00:39:55,273 --> 00:39:57,207
Calm down, Bhim. Calm down!
- Huh!

518
00:40:00,578 --> 00:40:02,808
It is a grave sin to humiliate
a lady, Duryodhan.

519
00:40:04,148 --> 00:40:06,480
Father, after surviving
on the King's mercy.

520
00:40:06,551 --> 00:40:09,247
To say something against his
wishes is a greater sin!

521
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,378
Leave me!

522
00:40:11,489 --> 00:40:12,547
Leave me!

523
00:40:12,824 --> 00:40:13,882
Please leave me!

524
00:40:19,764 --> 00:40:20,822
Leave me!

525
00:40:24,235 --> 00:40:25,634
Leave me! Leave me!

526
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:27,228
Leave me!

527
00:40:27,739 --> 00:40:30,173
Draupadi, look at your Pandavas!

528
00:40:33,911 --> 00:40:37,403
Panchali, inspite the ones with
eyes being in front of you.

529
00:40:37,648 --> 00:40:38,808
They are blind for you!

530
00:40:39,484 --> 00:40:41,850
From today you are not
the queen of Pandavas.

531
00:40:42,353 --> 00:40:43,411
You are the maid of Kauravas!

532
00:40:43,488 --> 00:40:44,546
Duryodhan!!!

533
00:40:45,923 --> 00:40:48,687
Not once! Thousand times
you are a slave.

534
00:40:49,794 --> 00:40:51,659
Dharam Raj along with his brothers.

535
00:40:51,829 --> 00:40:53,558
He has lost you also gambling.

536
00:40:54,332 --> 00:40:56,357
Dusshashan, what are you staring at?

537
00:40:56,534 --> 00:40:57,592
Pull her sari!

538
00:40:58,369 --> 00:40:59,427
Wait!

539
00:41:00,238 --> 00:41:03,435
Suyodhan, the revenge for
insult is not injustice.

540
00:41:03,574 --> 00:41:06,737
Uncle Vidhur, we don't want
to hear your lecture.

541
00:41:07,512 --> 00:41:09,412
If you can't see then
shut your eyes.

542
00:41:09,647 --> 00:41:11,444
If you can't hear then
shut your ears.

543
00:41:11,616 --> 00:41:12,674
Understood?

544
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:14,511
Dusshashan!
- Dusshashan!?

545
00:41:18,723 --> 00:41:20,213
Move back! I said move back!

546
00:41:20,491 --> 00:41:21,549
You sinner!

547
00:41:21,626 --> 00:41:23,457
Bhim! Arjun!

548
00:41:24,462 --> 00:41:27,693
Sahadev, Nakul! Help me!

549
00:41:28,166 --> 00:41:29,258
Protect me!

550
00:41:29,333 --> 00:41:31,324
Protect me. Help me!

551
00:41:31,669 --> 00:41:32,727
Defend me!

552
00:41:32,837 --> 00:41:33,895
Yell more!

553
00:41:33,971 --> 00:41:36,565
They have become deaf for you!

554
00:41:36,641 --> 00:41:38,268
Shame on this male species!

555
00:41:39,177 --> 00:41:41,771
Today a helpless lady is disgraced
in a crowded court!

556
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:45,174
Today the brave men who
fought for the respect...

557
00:41:45,249 --> 00:41:46,546
...of daughter-in-laws and daughters.

558
00:41:47,418 --> 00:41:49,386
They are sitting idle
and watching the drama.

559
00:41:49,887 --> 00:41:51,479
On your helplessness...

560
00:41:51,556 --> 00:41:53,615
The future generation will disgrace
you again and again.

561
00:41:53,691 --> 00:41:55,784
Draupadi!!!
- What are you thinking, Dusshashan?

562
00:41:55,927 --> 00:41:57,189
Pull off her sari!

563
00:41:57,261 --> 00:41:59,252
And show her that sons of
a blind man are not blind!

564
00:42:04,535 --> 00:42:08,130
Help me! Brother... Krishna...
Kanhaiyya!

565
00:42:08,873 --> 00:42:10,135
Kanhaiyya!

566
00:42:13,744 --> 00:42:14,802
Kanhaiyya!

567
00:42:15,413 --> 00:42:16,471
Kanhaiyya!

568
00:42:21,152 --> 00:42:22,210
Kanhaiyya!

569
00:43:33,357 --> 00:43:35,518
Why did you call me suddenly, uncle?

570
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,788
One intention and two
work, Balram-ji.

571
00:43:39,463 --> 00:43:44,332
I want your relation to
strengthen with Kauravas.

572
00:43:44,568 --> 00:43:45,626
What do you mean?

573
00:43:45,703 --> 00:43:51,539
I mean your daughter Surekha
must be ready for marriage.

574
00:43:51,609 --> 00:43:55,477
Yes! Yes! She will get married
to Arjun's son Abhimanyu.

575
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,511
You'll commit a big mistake,
Balram-ji.

576
00:43:58,182 --> 00:44:01,117
Pandavas have lost everything to us.

577
00:44:01,652 --> 00:44:04,143
And gone to the jungle
on exile for 13 years.

578
00:44:04,221 --> 00:44:05,279
What did you say!?

579
00:44:05,356 --> 00:44:07,517
Definitely you all must
have cheated them.

580
00:44:07,591 --> 00:44:08,819
We are innocent, My lord.

581
00:44:09,427 --> 00:44:11,759
Dharam Raj himself forced
us to play gambling.

582
00:44:12,863 --> 00:44:15,388
If Dharam Raj didn't had
the habit of gambling.

583
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:19,797
He must not have been
a human but God.

584
00:44:20,438 --> 00:44:21,735
You are right.

585
00:44:22,873 --> 00:44:26,741
Except God; every human
has some fault.

586
00:44:27,678 --> 00:44:32,138
Great warrior, Balram-ji! The
worst definitely takes place!

587
00:44:33,451 --> 00:44:37,148
By the way Duryodhan's son Laxman...

588
00:44:37,221 --> 00:44:39,451
...is better looking than Abhimanyu.

589
00:44:39,757 --> 00:44:40,883
He is more talented.

590
00:44:41,392 --> 00:44:42,450
He is brave.

591
00:44:42,526 --> 00:44:44,858
Yes! I have not seen him yet.

592
00:44:45,696 --> 00:44:46,754
Where is Laxman?

593
00:45:01,479 --> 00:45:02,605
What happened?
- He is dead!

594
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:03,738
Huh? He's dead!?

595
00:45:03,814 --> 00:45:06,214
Oh my child! My dear
child! My child!

596
00:45:06,851 --> 00:45:08,819
My support of old age is no more?

597
00:45:09,186 --> 00:45:11,450
King, my support of
old age is no more.

598
00:45:11,822 --> 00:45:14,313
Your majesty, what will
I do now, King?

599
00:45:14,692 --> 00:45:17,126
Father, I am alive.

600
00:45:17,194 --> 00:45:18,252
Shut up!

601
00:45:18,329 --> 00:45:20,354
Are you intelligent or our doctor?

602
00:45:20,564 --> 00:45:22,794
He said once that you are dead!

603
00:45:23,334 --> 00:45:24,562
That means you are dead!

604
00:45:24,635 --> 00:45:26,125
Come on. Die now! Die!
- Hey no!

605
00:45:26,203 --> 00:45:27,261
Prince!

606
00:45:28,205 --> 00:45:30,366
Who else has died?
- You are called.

607
00:45:30,441 --> 00:45:32,841
Where? Hey I am going
to the graveyard.

608
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:34,844
Shall I send uncle Shakuni
to graveyard too?

609
00:45:34,912 --> 00:45:36,777
What did you say? Uncle
Shakuni has called me?

610
00:45:36,881 --> 00:45:38,439
Hey, why didn't you say before?

611
00:45:38,749 --> 00:45:39,807
You fool!

612
00:45:40,785 --> 00:45:41,843
Greetings, elders!

613
00:45:45,156 --> 00:45:46,521
Come dear Laxman, come.

614
00:45:54,498 --> 00:45:56,659
Take the blessings of respective
Baldev-ji, dear.

615
00:46:00,271 --> 00:46:01,329
Live long, dear!

616
00:46:07,845 --> 00:46:09,210
Leave my feet, dear.

617
00:46:09,513 --> 00:46:10,571
Leave my feet.

618
00:46:12,716 --> 00:46:14,809
He is a very respectable boy.

619
00:46:15,219 --> 00:46:18,120
Laxman, why don't you
leave his feet, dear?

620
00:46:18,456 --> 00:46:19,616
For one thing.

621
00:46:19,857 --> 00:46:21,722
Until elder uncle doesn't
promises me for one thing.

622
00:46:21,792 --> 00:46:23,487
I won't leave his feet. Yeah!

623
00:46:25,663 --> 00:46:27,528
Child is stubborn, Baldev-ji.

624
00:46:30,601 --> 00:46:32,466
Leave it, dear.
- Hey no!

625
00:46:33,304 --> 00:46:34,737
First you promise me.

626
00:46:35,339 --> 00:46:37,136
All right dear, I promise you.

627
00:46:37,308 --> 00:46:38,366
At least leave them now.

628
00:46:43,414 --> 00:46:44,745
You have promised me. Right?

629
00:46:45,149 --> 00:46:47,617
Yes! Yes! Tell me.
What's the matter?

630
00:46:48,886 --> 00:46:53,414
Then... get me married to Surekha!

631
00:46:54,291 --> 00:46:55,519
All right, tell me.

632
00:46:55,826 --> 00:46:57,384
Do you know politics?

633
00:46:57,461 --> 00:47:00,157
No! I like gilli-danda
(game of sticks.'

634
00:47:00,364 --> 00:47:02,093
Click! Ton!

635
00:47:02,566 --> 00:47:03,828
Click!? Ton!?

636
00:47:06,203 --> 00:47:08,194
It is a matter to understand,
Baldev-ji.

637
00:47:08,706 --> 00:47:11,641
You hit hard on the point
of the dice. It jumps.

638
00:47:12,176 --> 00:47:14,508
You hit it hard with the stick.
It goes and falls far off.

639
00:47:14,845 --> 00:47:17,405
These are the tactics of politics.

640
00:47:17,648 --> 00:47:21,209
And this is what our
Laxman means to say.

641
00:47:23,587 --> 00:47:25,248
Do you know archery?

642
00:47:25,589 --> 00:47:28,285
I like to sing and dance.

643
00:47:28,359 --> 00:47:31,294
Tak-dhin! Tak-dhin! Tak-dhin!
Tak-dhin!

644
00:47:31,362 --> 00:47:33,728
Tak-dhin! Tak-dhin! Tak-dhin!

645
00:47:35,299 --> 00:47:36,357
What does he mean?

646
00:47:36,433 --> 00:47:37,866
Inspite of being brave.

647
00:47:37,935 --> 00:47:41,530
Our Laxman is an expert
in dance and singing.

648
00:47:41,605 --> 00:47:44,301
Excellent! He is really
very talented.

649
00:47:45,376 --> 00:47:46,741
Definitely he will be!

650
00:47:47,178 --> 00:47:49,612
Because I have trained
him after all!

651
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:54,140
And Balram-ji... anyway
I am an expert player!

652
00:48:08,098 --> 00:48:10,328
Kauravs have given so many gifts.

653
00:48:11,168 --> 00:48:12,829
This gift is not for me.

654
00:48:13,637 --> 00:48:16,162
Its for Duryodhan's future
daughter-in-law Surekha.

655
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:17,498
Mother!

656
00:48:28,719 --> 00:48:32,655
You had fixed Surekha alliance
with Abhimanyu.

657
00:48:32,723 --> 00:48:34,190
Now I have changed my mind!

658
00:48:34,558 --> 00:48:35,820
Now Pandavs have become beggars.

659
00:48:36,594 --> 00:48:37,856
They lost everything in gambling.

660
00:48:38,362 --> 00:48:39,829
And they have gone to live
in the jungle for 13 years!

661
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:41,188
What!

662
00:48:41,265 --> 00:48:42,527
Pandavs have lost their wealth.

663
00:48:42,766 --> 00:48:43,858
But not their religion, brother.

664
00:48:44,134 --> 00:48:46,295
Religion and wisdom doesn't last
for long with poor people!

665
00:48:46,737 --> 00:48:49,137
Poor people protect
wisdom and religion!

666
00:48:49,206 --> 00:48:50,264
And it will be so in the future too.

667
00:48:50,341 --> 00:48:51,399
No matter what, Kanhaiya!

668
00:48:51,642 --> 00:48:53,337
I have given my oath to Kauravs!

669
00:48:54,545 --> 00:48:59,141
Kauravs' gems and wealth have
not just blinded your eyes...

670
00:48:59,216 --> 00:49:00,740
...but your senses too.

671
00:49:00,818 --> 00:49:02,080
Keep quiet, Kanhaiya!

672
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:04,617
I won't listen to you in the
matter of this marriage!

673
00:49:06,090 --> 00:49:07,387
As you wish!

674
00:49:08,125 --> 00:49:15,429
Come, beloved.

675
00:49:17,167 --> 00:49:26,769
My love is calling you. Do come.

676
00:49:40,591 --> 00:49:45,426
Stars, you all are smiling

677
00:49:46,463 --> 00:49:50,194
Stars, you all are smiling

678
00:49:50,567 --> 00:49:55,129
Somebody's love is crying.

679
00:49:55,439 --> 00:50:00,274
My world is crying.

680
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:06,879
Stars, you all are smiling

681
00:50:07,484 --> 00:50:11,682
Somebody's love is crying.

682
00:50:12,222 --> 00:50:16,852
My world is crying.

683
00:50:32,176 --> 00:50:39,810
If I have to part from you,
then how will I live?

684
00:50:41,418 --> 00:50:48,824
If I have to part from you,
then how will I live?

685
00:50:50,494 --> 00:50:54,362
Tears are not less than poison.

686
00:50:54,898 --> 00:50:58,197
How will I endure it?

687
00:50:58,502 --> 00:51:02,336
How will I endure it?

688
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:06,839
The one whose heart is hurt.

689
00:51:07,311 --> 00:51:11,372
That person cries many times.

690
00:51:11,782 --> 00:51:16,151
My world is crying.

691
00:51:17,254 --> 00:51:20,451
Stars, you all are smiling

692
00:51:20,791 --> 00:51:24,887
Somebody's love is crying.

693
00:51:25,362 --> 00:51:30,163
My world is crying.

694
00:51:44,615 --> 00:51:52,386
The twilight is adorned
with moon and stars.

695
00:51:53,524 --> 00:52:01,363
The twilight is adorned
with moon and stars.

696
00:52:02,466 --> 00:52:09,838
Fate has filled my
life with thorns.

697
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:14,140
With thorns.

698
00:52:15,345 --> 00:52:18,405
The moon is smiling.

699
00:52:18,782 --> 00:52:22,843
My adornment is crying.

700
00:52:23,387 --> 00:52:27,551
My world is crying.

701
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:31,756
Stars, you all are smiling

702
00:52:32,229 --> 00:52:36,222
Somebody's love is crying.

703
00:52:36,567 --> 00:52:42,767
My world is crying.

704
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:44,834
'My dear sister Subadra.'

705
00:52:45,576 --> 00:52:47,168
'Pandavs have lost everything
in gambling...

706
00:52:47,244 --> 00:52:48,506
...and they have gone to
live in the forest.'

707
00:52:49,379 --> 00:52:53,179
'So brother has fixed
Surekha's alliance...

708
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:54,615
...with Duryodhan's son Laxman.'

709
00:52:59,690 --> 00:53:01,123
Such insult of the Pandavs!

710
00:53:02,226 --> 00:53:03,716
Lts all circumstance's fault, son!

711
00:53:04,161 --> 00:53:06,288
Lts greedy Balram's fault!

712
00:53:06,797 --> 00:53:08,560
I swear on your nursing, mother!

713
00:53:09,433 --> 00:53:13,130
If I didn't abduct Surekha from
the Yadavs and Kauravs...

714
00:53:13,203 --> 00:53:14,397
...then I too am not Abhimanyu!

715
00:53:15,239 --> 00:53:16,297
Abhimanyu!

716
00:53:20,811 --> 00:53:21,869
Son!

717
00:53:26,583 --> 00:53:27,641
Mother!

718
00:53:56,747 --> 00:53:59,910
Abhimanyu! I am very thirsty!

719
00:54:00,484 --> 00:54:02,179
Even I am thirsty!

720
00:54:02,553 --> 00:54:04,111
But from where will we get water...

721
00:54:04,187 --> 00:54:07,122
...in this wild jungle
in the night, son?

722
00:54:07,190 --> 00:54:08,452
You don't worry, mother.

723
00:54:11,328 --> 00:54:12,386
I will just get it!

724
00:54:12,796 --> 00:54:14,320
Abhimanyu!
- Mother!

725
00:54:14,765 --> 00:54:16,357
Son, be careful!

726
00:54:16,433 --> 00:54:17,525
You don't worry!

727
00:55:26,503 --> 00:55:27,561
Water!

728
00:56:12,849 --> 00:56:15,647
I think this is an enchanted jungle!

729
00:57:00,697 --> 00:57:02,358
Who is it? Come in front of me!

730
00:57:02,699 --> 00:57:04,633
Otherwise I will set the
entire jungle ablaze!

731
00:57:45,675 --> 00:57:49,736
Abhimanyu! Abhimanyu!

732
00:58:26,783 --> 00:58:28,774
Abhimanyu! Abhimanyu!

733
00:59:14,197 --> 00:59:16,825
Cruel! Now let me
see how you escape!

734
00:59:25,542 --> 00:59:27,806
You seem to be a brave
warrior's son!

735
00:59:29,112 --> 00:59:30,511
I am your death, coward!

736
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:33,715
Now you can't escape from
my arrow! Beware!

737
00:59:38,255 --> 00:59:42,658
Wow! I think a girl
caught you archery!

738
00:59:45,462 --> 00:59:48,124
If you are a true man then
forgo this deceit...

739
00:59:48,198 --> 00:59:49,825
...and confront me!

740
00:59:50,267 --> 00:59:51,461
Confront you! Here!

741
00:59:55,405 --> 00:59:56,463
Abhimanyu!

742
01:00:00,877 --> 01:00:02,845
Abhimanyu! Abhimanyu!

743
01:00:04,447 --> 01:00:06,779
My son! My son! Abhimanyu!

744
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:10,686
My son! Who hit my son?

745
01:00:11,354 --> 01:00:15,620
Abhimanyu! Tell me, son!
Abhimanyu! My son!

746
01:00:17,661 --> 01:00:21,392
Who is it? Come in front of me!

747
01:00:22,699 --> 01:00:24,826
Otherwise I swear on my husband.

748
01:00:27,270 --> 01:00:28,328
I will curse you!

749
01:00:34,678 --> 01:00:37,738
Cruel! You were not ashamed to
raise your hands on a child?

750
01:00:39,582 --> 01:00:40,640
Remember!

751
01:00:40,784 --> 01:00:42,684
You have killed that Arjun's son...

752
01:00:43,219 --> 01:00:45,744
...who can split the earth and
spring forth the holy water.

753
01:00:46,189 --> 01:00:48,248
You have killed that mighty
Bheem's nephew...

754
01:00:48,825 --> 01:00:51,623
...whose club is enough
to frighten everybody.

755
01:00:52,195 --> 01:00:53,924
You have killed Pandavs' dear one...

756
01:00:54,297 --> 01:00:56,197
...whose name is enough to
scare the entire universe!

757
01:00:56,466 --> 01:00:58,195
Now see my power!

758
01:00:58,268 --> 01:00:59,701
Mother! Son!

759
01:01:01,638 --> 01:01:05,699
Aren't you ashamed to first kill
my son and then call me mother?

760
01:01:06,209 --> 01:01:07,676
I will never forgive you!

761
01:01:09,446 --> 01:01:10,504
Son!

762
01:01:14,617 --> 01:01:16,209
What crime has my son committed?

763
01:01:16,353 --> 01:01:17,411
Mother!

764
01:01:22,158 --> 01:01:24,490
Mother! Forgive me, mother!

765
01:01:24,894 --> 01:01:26,657
By mistake I killed my own brother!

766
01:01:26,763 --> 01:01:28,663
Brother? Who is your brother?

767
01:01:34,270 --> 01:01:37,706
My son! My son! Abhimanyu!

768
01:01:39,843 --> 01:01:40,901
Who are you, sister?

769
01:01:42,746 --> 01:01:44,179
She is aunt Subadra.

770
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:45,770
And he is my brother Abhimanyu!

771
01:01:45,849 --> 01:01:47,180
Uncle Arjun's son!

772
01:01:47,450 --> 01:01:49,179
Now what will happen to my son?

773
01:01:49,285 --> 01:01:50,445
Sister, you don't worry.

774
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:53,320
Bring nectar from hell, Gatotkutch.

775
01:01:53,390 --> 01:01:55,654
Okay, mother. You take him
home. I will just come.

776
01:01:56,793 --> 01:01:57,851
Mother!

777
01:02:00,630 --> 01:02:03,155
Here, mother. Give it to brother.

778
01:02:03,666 --> 01:02:04,758
He will regain consciousness.

779
01:02:05,335 --> 01:02:07,132
Here, sister. You give it to him.

780
01:02:37,767 --> 01:02:38,825
Mother!

781
01:02:39,836 --> 01:02:43,363
Cruel! You and here? Where
is my bow and arrow?

782
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:45,670
No, son. He is your brother.

783
01:02:46,876 --> 01:02:48,673
My brother?
- Yes, son.

784
01:02:49,179 --> 01:02:52,910
He is your mighty uncle
Bheem's son Gatotkutch.

785
01:02:55,919 --> 01:02:57,352
Brother! Brother!

786
01:03:00,190 --> 01:03:04,126
But such a lovely palace
in this dangerous jungle?

787
01:03:04,594 --> 01:03:06,619
This is Gatotkutch's
magic, Abhimanyu.

788
01:03:06,696 --> 01:03:10,530
This is nothing, brother. You have
still not seen magic. Is that so?

789
01:03:17,340 --> 01:03:22,869
Brother, can your magic
help me see the person...

790
01:03:23,146 --> 01:03:24,204
...whom I want to see?

791
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:25,542
Whom do you want to see?

792
01:03:27,717 --> 01:03:30,880
How do I tell you...
whom I want to see?

793
01:03:31,387 --> 01:03:34,254
I see! So this is the matter! Sit!

794
01:03:38,862 --> 01:03:42,389
You will see the person whom
you want to see! Look!

795
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:13,517
Fair, rosy cheeks.

796
01:05:13,590 --> 01:05:16,616
Red with embarrassment.

797
01:05:16,693 --> 01:05:22,791
Beloved, don't look
at me like this.

798
01:05:22,865 --> 01:05:26,198
Your fair cheeks.

799
01:05:26,269 --> 01:05:29,329
It will always turn red.

800
01:05:29,405 --> 01:05:32,738
Damsel, when eyes lock, I
lose control over myself.

801
01:05:32,809 --> 01:05:35,539
My heart changes.

802
01:05:35,612 --> 01:05:38,740
Fair, rosy cheeks.

803
01:05:51,594 --> 01:05:53,289
Gait is crazy.

804
01:05:53,496 --> 01:05:58,229
This is the result of youth.

805
01:06:01,170 --> 01:06:02,694
Gait is crazy.

806
01:06:02,772 --> 01:06:07,334
This is the result of youth.

807
01:06:07,410 --> 01:06:10,538
Damsel, you agreed.

808
01:06:10,613 --> 01:06:13,309
But the story is something else.

809
01:06:13,650 --> 01:06:16,483
Damsel, your and my pair
has been formed just now.

810
01:06:16,552 --> 01:06:19,783
Now unite the tinkling
of the anklet too.

811
01:06:19,856 --> 01:06:22,620
Fair, rosy cheeks.

812
01:06:22,692 --> 01:06:25,684
Red with embarrassment.

813
01:06:25,762 --> 01:06:31,462
Beloved, don't look
at me like this.

814
01:06:31,801 --> 01:06:34,861
Fair, rosy cheeks.

815
01:07:30,860 --> 01:07:37,163
Heart leaps here
and there in love.

816
01:07:40,269 --> 01:07:46,208
Heart leaps here
and there in love.

817
01:07:46,542 --> 01:07:52,538
At first sight eyes steal
solace and heart.

818
01:07:52,615 --> 01:07:55,584
Sweet talks and meeting secretly.

819
01:07:55,651 --> 01:07:58,779
This is the magic of love.

820
01:07:58,855 --> 01:08:01,653
Fair, rosy cheeks.

821
01:08:01,724 --> 01:08:04,557
Red with embarrassment.

822
01:08:04,627 --> 01:08:08,085
Damsel, when eyes lock, I
lose control over myself.

823
01:08:08,164 --> 01:08:10,758
My heart changes.

824
01:08:10,833 --> 01:08:13,825
Fair, rosy cheeks.

825
01:09:38,788 --> 01:09:45,125
If you want to feel coy then
stop dwelling in heart.

826
01:09:48,231 --> 01:09:54,329
If you want to feel coy then
stop dwelling in heart.

827
01:09:54,403 --> 01:09:57,531
I will listen to you.

828
01:09:57,607 --> 01:10:00,542
But you lock eyes with me.

829
01:10:00,610 --> 01:10:03,408
Damsel, your and my pair
has been formed just now.

830
01:10:03,479 --> 01:10:06,414
Now unite the tinkling
of the anklet too.

831
01:10:06,482 --> 01:10:09,417
Fair, rosy cheeks.

832
01:10:09,485 --> 01:10:12,454
Red with embarrassment.

833
01:10:12,522 --> 01:10:15,821
Damsel, when eyes lock, I
lose control over myself.

834
01:10:15,892 --> 01:10:18,156
My heart changes.

835
01:10:18,494 --> 01:10:21,657
Fair, rosy cheeks.

836
01:10:29,739 --> 01:10:31,604
Fair, rosy cheeks.

837
01:10:31,674 --> 01:10:33,733
Red with embarrassment.

838
01:10:33,809 --> 01:10:35,743
Your fair cheeks.

839
01:10:35,811 --> 01:10:37,836
It will always turn red.

840
01:10:37,914 --> 01:10:40,178
Fair, rosy cheeks.

841
01:10:40,249 --> 01:10:42,240
Red with embarrassment.

842
01:10:42,318 --> 01:10:44,252
Your fair cheeks.

843
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:46,345
It will always turn red.

844
01:10:46,422 --> 01:10:48,481
Fair, rosy cheeks.

845
01:10:48,558 --> 01:10:50,617
It will always turn red.

846
01:10:50,693 --> 01:10:52,661
Fair, rosy cheeks.

847
01:10:52,728 --> 01:10:54,753
It will always turn red.

848
01:10:54,830 --> 01:10:56,821
Fair, rosy cheeks.

849
01:10:56,899 --> 01:10:58,764
Fair, rosy cheeks.

850
01:11:03,472 --> 01:11:05,372
You didn't like the dance?

851
01:11:05,875 --> 01:11:11,245
I won't like anything until I take
revenge for Pandavs' insult!

852
01:11:14,483 --> 01:11:15,541
Abhimanyu!

853
01:11:16,385 --> 01:11:18,785
Don't stigmatise your
father Arjun's bravery.

854
01:11:19,689 --> 01:11:22,157
If you want to take revenge
for the humiliation...

855
01:11:22,224 --> 01:11:26,160
...then challenge and
then abduct Surekha.

856
01:11:26,596 --> 01:11:27,756
This is what will happen, mother!

857
01:11:28,798 --> 01:11:32,632
Gatotkutch! Look after my Abhimanyu!

858
01:11:32,702 --> 01:11:33,862
Have faith in me, aunt.

859
01:11:34,370 --> 01:11:35,803
In sorrow I will be in
front of Abhimanyu!

860
01:11:36,172 --> 01:11:38,333
And in joy behind him!
- Brother!

861
01:11:42,578 --> 01:11:43,636
Come on, brother!

862
01:11:47,750 --> 01:11:49,342
Son, be careful.

863
01:11:49,652 --> 01:11:53,452
Mother, don't worry. Brother,
sit carefully.

864
01:12:09,605 --> 01:12:12,199
I don't know what poor Surekha
is going through.

865
01:12:12,408 --> 01:12:15,400
I don't know about that.
But your plight is bad.

866
01:12:29,392 --> 01:12:30,825
Brother, look!

867
01:12:32,228 --> 01:12:33,889
This is Dwarika which
is like a maze.

868
01:12:34,497 --> 01:12:36,658
Here we will have to
be really careful.

869
01:12:36,832 --> 01:12:38,459
Is that so? Yes!

870
01:12:38,901 --> 01:12:41,165
My uncle Krishna
has magical powers!

871
01:12:41,237 --> 01:12:42,465
I too am not less than him!

872
01:12:42,638 --> 01:12:44,731
Someday uncle and nephew
will lock horns!

873
01:12:44,874 --> 01:12:47,240
It's not beneficial for us
to lock horns with him.

874
01:12:47,376 --> 01:12:51,437
You are right. You will
abduct his niece Surekha.

875
01:12:51,847 --> 01:12:55,613
And he will play the flute.

876
01:12:57,386 --> 01:13:00,753
I don't know. As such
he loves me a lot.

877
01:13:01,123 --> 01:13:03,182
Don't fall in his love.

878
01:13:03,592 --> 01:13:09,428
Does Surekha, whom you love,
also love you?

879
01:13:09,598 --> 01:13:11,862
She loves me a lot.

880
01:13:12,134 --> 01:13:14,193
Then I will abduct her in a jiffy.

881
01:13:18,207 --> 01:13:20,266
But how will you recognise her?

882
01:13:20,543 --> 01:13:23,341
Yes! I forgot the main thing!

883
01:13:24,647 --> 01:13:27,138
Tell me. How does she look like?

884
01:13:27,650 --> 01:13:32,280
Doe eyes. Lovely eyebrows.
- Wow!

885
01:13:32,888 --> 01:13:34,685
Parrot like nose.
- Wow!

886
01:13:36,325 --> 01:13:38,418
Pearly white teeth.
- Wow!

887
01:13:38,661 --> 01:13:40,686
She has neck like a pigeon.
- Wow!

888
01:13:41,630 --> 01:13:43,393
Lovely face.

889
01:13:43,733 --> 01:13:44,791
Enough! Enough! Enough!

890
01:13:45,501 --> 01:13:48,493
If you told me so many things
then I will forget everything.

891
01:13:48,771 --> 01:13:50,796
Tell me some unique mark.

892
01:13:51,340 --> 01:13:54,605
Big eyes. Lovely face.

893
01:13:55,277 --> 01:13:57,438
And a black mole beneath her lips.

894
01:13:57,713 --> 01:13:59,874
Enough! Enough! Enough!
I understood everything!

895
01:14:00,216 --> 01:14:01,274
Now you rest!

896
01:14:06,722 --> 01:14:07,780
Surekha!

897
01:14:09,592 --> 01:14:10,650
Mother!

898
01:14:16,132 --> 01:14:17,827
Mother! Mother!

899
01:14:18,868 --> 01:14:20,130
What's the matter, dear?

900
01:14:20,236 --> 01:14:24,730
Mother! I won't marry Laxman,
mother! Never, mother!

901
01:14:25,174 --> 01:14:29,577
You will marry Laxman!
I have promised him!

902
01:14:30,713 --> 01:14:35,241
Father, you will fulfil your oath
by sacrificing my desires?

903
01:14:35,684 --> 01:14:37,311
Laxman is very handsome.

904
01:14:37,887 --> 01:14:39,184
Must be for you!

905
01:14:39,455 --> 01:14:41,252
He is wealthy too, dear.

906
01:14:41,590 --> 01:14:45,720
Father, in your greed you
want to sell me to Kauravs.

907
01:14:45,828 --> 01:14:46,886
Surekha!

908
01:14:47,463 --> 01:14:49,328
I won't marry Laxman!

909
01:14:49,398 --> 01:14:50,763
You will marry him!

910
01:14:51,167 --> 01:14:53,761
You are my father. But you
can't decide my fate.

911
01:14:53,836 --> 01:14:54,894
Shut up!

912
01:14:55,504 --> 01:14:56,596
Mother! My lord!

913
01:14:56,705 --> 01:14:58,195
Everybody leave the room!

914
01:14:58,474 --> 01:15:01,102
Until she doesn't agree
to marry Laxman...

915
01:15:01,243 --> 01:15:02,505
...she won't be given
any food or water!

916
01:15:02,745 --> 01:15:04,440
Guards carrying swords will
be guarding her room!

917
01:15:04,647 --> 01:15:06,410
Let's go! Come on!
- Dear!

918
01:15:07,216 --> 01:15:08,274
Come on!

919
01:15:12,488 --> 01:15:14,353
Open! Open the door!

920
01:15:14,490 --> 01:15:16,549
Open! I say open the door!

921
01:15:16,625 --> 01:15:17,853
King doesn't permit this!

922
01:15:39,348 --> 01:15:42,181
Oh! So you are Kanhaiya!

923
01:16:01,570 --> 01:16:04,095
Now snore peacefully, uncle.

924
01:16:17,853 --> 01:16:20,686
Is Laxman less handsome
than Abhimanyu?

925
01:16:21,123 --> 01:16:22,181
What are you saying?

926
01:16:22,391 --> 01:16:25,189
Laxman can't be compared
to Abhimanyu!

927
01:17:33,195 --> 01:17:36,289
Lovely face!

928
01:17:39,335 --> 01:17:43,328
Mole beneath the lips. Yes.

929
01:17:47,676 --> 01:17:48,734
Another mole.

930
01:17:51,146 --> 01:17:52,204
Two moles.

931
01:19:50,699 --> 01:19:58,128
Why are you so proud...

932
01:19:58,207 --> 01:20:03,338
...of your strength?

933
01:20:04,179 --> 01:20:16,819
I have seen countless mighty
people like you.

934
01:20:22,364 --> 01:20:27,563
You are worth nothing.
Don't be so proud.

935
01:20:28,170 --> 01:20:31,765
You are a toy made of dust.

936
01:20:32,241 --> 01:20:37,178
You are worth nothing.
Don't be so proud.

937
01:20:37,379 --> 01:20:41,315
You are a toy made of dust.

938
01:20:41,416 --> 01:20:45,284
You are worth nothing.

939
01:21:04,806 --> 01:21:09,209
It's showering and lightening.

940
01:21:09,578 --> 01:21:14,242
Why are you being stubborn?

941
01:21:14,316 --> 01:21:18,377
It's showering and lightening.

942
01:21:18,820 --> 01:21:23,223
Why are you being stubborn?

943
01:21:23,525 --> 01:21:27,655
Why is the cloud mad?

944
01:21:28,163 --> 01:21:32,395
The storm will blow you away.

945
01:21:32,668 --> 01:21:37,162
Why is the cloud mad?

946
01:21:37,372 --> 01:21:41,399
The storm will blow you away.

947
01:21:41,843 --> 01:21:44,573
Smart people get smarter people.

948
01:21:44,746 --> 01:21:46,873
Don't delay.

949
01:21:47,349 --> 01:21:51,217
You are a toy made of dust.

950
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:56,189
You are worth nothing.
Don't be so proud.

951
01:21:56,425 --> 01:22:00,191
You are a toy made of dust.

952
01:22:00,329 --> 01:22:04,322
You are worth nothing.

953
01:22:23,252 --> 01:22:27,518
Why do you act so smugly?

954
01:22:27,823 --> 01:22:32,487
When fate laughs at you.

955
01:22:32,561 --> 01:22:36,657
Why do you act so smugly?

956
01:22:37,232 --> 01:22:41,430
When fate laughs at you.

957
01:22:41,903 --> 01:22:46,203
You are a small lamp.

958
01:22:46,408 --> 01:22:50,606
Did you ever see the sun?

959
01:22:51,179 --> 01:22:55,343
You are a small lamp.

960
01:22:55,584 --> 01:22:59,645
Did you ever see the sun?

961
01:23:00,188 --> 01:23:02,622
You are in a trance
of false delusion.

962
01:23:02,858 --> 01:23:05,122
This ego will break.

963
01:23:05,294 --> 01:23:09,230
You are a toy made of dust.

964
01:23:09,298 --> 01:23:14,133
You are worth nothing.
Don't be so proud.

965
01:23:14,336 --> 01:23:18,170
You are a toy made of dust.

966
01:23:18,307 --> 01:23:22,243
You are worth nothing.

967
01:23:22,311 --> 01:23:24,142
Hey, old man! Stop singing!

968
01:23:24,546 --> 01:23:26,673
Why? Do you have hearing problem?

969
01:23:26,815 --> 01:23:28,783
No! I am burning with rage!

970
01:23:29,217 --> 01:23:30,741
You might really burn.

971
01:23:30,819 --> 01:23:32,377
Old man, stop this nonsense!

972
01:23:32,888 --> 01:23:35,755
Nobody likes the truth, dear.

973
01:23:35,891 --> 01:23:37,620
Stop this nonsense! Otherwise...

974
01:23:37,693 --> 01:23:39,320
Otherwise what will you do, dear?

975
01:23:39,461 --> 01:23:40,826
I will kill you!

976
01:23:41,196 --> 01:23:46,259
Thanks! I really desire
to die! Kill me, dear!

977
01:23:46,335 --> 01:23:48,166
Foolish old man! Wait!

978
01:23:55,711 --> 01:23:58,771
Dear, use both your hands.
After all I am old.

979
01:23:58,847 --> 01:23:59,905
Fine!

980
01:24:02,250 --> 01:24:03,376
I should use both my hands!

981
01:24:22,204 --> 01:24:23,728
Dear, wipe your sweat.

982
01:24:33,148 --> 01:24:35,412
Don't lose hope. Try again.

983
01:24:35,684 --> 01:24:39,450
Am I your servant? Try again!
Don't lose hope!

984
01:24:49,297 --> 01:24:51,857
Uncle's nephew, great!

985
01:24:55,637 --> 01:24:57,901
Brother! You have returned!
- Yes!

986
01:24:58,540 --> 01:25:00,735
Where is Surekha?
- Where she was earlier!

987
01:25:01,276 --> 01:25:03,107
Then why did you go there?

988
01:25:03,345 --> 01:25:06,109
Why didn't you tell
me that Surekha...

989
01:25:06,181 --> 01:25:08,115
...has six sisters who look like her?

990
01:25:10,352 --> 01:25:11,410
What do you mean?

991
01:25:11,486 --> 01:25:13,113
There was Surekha all around!

992
01:25:13,221 --> 01:25:15,212
So I lost my mind!

993
01:25:15,290 --> 01:25:17,121
Brother, your senses
will ruin everything!

994
01:25:17,459 --> 01:25:19,359
You should use your brains
for difficult tasks.

995
01:25:19,428 --> 01:25:22,795
Brother, my brain is like my body!

996
01:25:22,864 --> 01:25:25,458
You are right. Brother,
now you rest.

997
01:25:25,634 --> 01:25:27,158
And I will go to meet Surekha.

998
01:25:27,335 --> 01:25:28,393
Fine! Go!

999
01:25:28,470 --> 01:25:32,201
And if you meet her,
then give her a ring!

1000
01:25:32,374 --> 01:25:34,205
So that next time there is no
mistake in recognising her.

1001
01:25:34,309 --> 01:25:35,469
You don't worry.

1002
01:25:37,646 --> 01:25:44,575
Come, beloved.

1003
01:25:45,253 --> 01:25:53,285
Eyes are open. Do come.

1004
01:26:13,148 --> 01:26:16,117
You don't worry. I will
find a solution.

1005
01:26:39,708 --> 01:26:40,766
Now come down.

1006
01:27:27,322 --> 01:27:29,847
There is merriment
in every flower.

1007
01:27:30,392 --> 01:27:32,792
The weather is lovely.

1008
01:27:33,328 --> 01:27:38,527
My heart is dancing in your love.

1009
01:27:39,267 --> 01:27:41,861
There is merriment
in every flower.

1010
01:27:42,237 --> 01:27:44,705
The weather is lovely.

1011
01:27:45,206 --> 01:27:50,576
My heart is dancing in your love.

1012
01:27:51,212 --> 01:27:54,773
There is merriment
in every flower.

1013
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:11,630
Today the weather is
showering flowers.

1014
01:28:11,700 --> 01:28:17,570
Seeing the bee, the butterfly
is applauding.

1015
01:28:20,508 --> 01:28:26,310
Today the weather is
showering flowers.

1016
01:28:26,381 --> 01:28:32,183
Seeing the bee, the butterfly
is applauding.

1017
01:28:32,253 --> 01:28:34,778
Everything is tinkling.

1018
01:28:35,190 --> 01:28:37,852
Every word is melodious.

1019
01:28:38,193 --> 01:28:43,358
My heart is dancing in your love.

1020
01:28:43,865 --> 01:28:46,629
There is merriment
in every flower.

1021
01:28:46,835 --> 01:28:49,360
The weather is lovely.

1022
01:28:49,704 --> 01:28:54,869
My heart is dancing in your love.

1023
01:28:55,543 --> 01:28:58,603
There is merriment
in every flower.

1024
01:29:21,603 --> 01:29:27,508
Life sings as song of love.

1025
01:29:27,575 --> 01:29:33,309
The moonlight walks with the moon.

1026
01:29:36,184 --> 01:29:42,123
Life sings as song of love.

1027
01:29:42,190 --> 01:29:47,594
The moonlight walks with the moon.

1028
01:29:47,729 --> 01:29:53,429
Love dances in the eyes.

1029
01:29:53,568 --> 01:29:58,801
My heart is dancing in your love.

1030
01:29:59,441 --> 01:30:02,205
There is merriment
in every flower.

1031
01:30:02,377 --> 01:30:04,868
The weather is lovely.

1032
01:30:05,246 --> 01:30:10,411
My heart is dancing in your love.

1033
01:30:10,885 --> 01:30:15,379
There is merriment
in every flower.

1034
01:30:15,123 --> 01:30:17,489
I saw it with my own eyes!
- You are lying!

1035
01:30:18,226 --> 01:30:19,284
I am telling the truth!

1036
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:22,523
I saw Princess with that
boy for the first time.

1037
01:30:22,597 --> 01:30:24,224
I don't believe this!

1038
01:30:25,033 --> 01:30:28,332
If this turned out to be a lie,
then I will strangulate you!

1039
01:30:28,603 --> 01:30:30,468
You can see it for yourself.
- Come on!

1040
01:30:33,007 --> 01:30:35,737
Abhimanyu! Surekha! Quickly
bring the boat to the shore!

1041
01:30:37,178 --> 01:30:38,577
Uncle!
- Uncle!

1042
01:30:38,646 --> 01:30:41,240
Hurry up, nephew! Otherwise
you will be in trouble!

1043
01:30:44,119 --> 01:30:46,019
Surekha! You both hide somewhere!

1044
01:30:46,087 --> 01:30:47,145
Brother is coming here!

1045
01:30:53,161 --> 01:30:55,686
There is merriment
in every flower.

1046
01:30:56,164 --> 01:30:58,598
The weather is lovely.

1047
01:30:59,100 --> 01:31:04,128
My heart is dancing in your love.

1048
01:31:05,039 --> 01:31:07,564
There is merriment
in every flower.

1049
01:31:08,042 --> 01:31:10,567
The weather is lovely.

1050
01:31:10,645 --> 01:31:15,981
My heart is dancing in your love.

1051
01:31:19,020 --> 01:31:20,715
Naughty one!
- Brother!

1052
01:31:21,256 --> 01:31:23,724
So late in the night you
are having a boat ride!

1053
01:31:24,359 --> 01:31:26,088
Brother, the night is really lovely!

1054
01:31:26,161 --> 01:31:28,026
But how come you are here
so late in the night?

1055
01:31:29,731 --> 01:31:33,360
Fool! Is this Surekha
or Rukmani's boat?

1056
01:31:34,102 --> 01:31:36,468
King, I couldn't have
made a mistake.

1057
01:31:36,538 --> 01:31:39,234
Go to Princess' chamber
and check out.

1058
01:31:39,307 --> 01:31:40,706
Fine! Let's go!

1059
01:32:07,435 --> 01:32:10,563
Brother, wait! Why
are you waking her?

1060
01:32:11,139 --> 01:32:12,333
With great difficulty
she fell asleep...

1061
01:32:12,407 --> 01:32:13,772
...a short while ago after
crying inconsolably!

1062
01:32:14,042 --> 01:32:15,202
She fell asleep a short while ago?

1063
01:32:16,978 --> 01:32:18,104
I won't wake her up!

1064
01:32:18,646 --> 01:32:22,241
King, believe me!
I saw Princess there!

1065
01:32:22,317 --> 01:32:24,512
Where? She is sleeping here!

1066
01:32:25,353 --> 01:32:28,151
Still we should know what is
true and what is not true!

1067
01:32:29,190 --> 01:32:30,248
You people leave!

1068
01:32:40,335 --> 01:32:45,739
Brother... you shouldn't
believe them!

1069
01:32:47,575 --> 01:32:49,509
Kanhaiya, I will ask Surekha!

1070
01:32:49,577 --> 01:32:51,408
But brother...
- What?

1071
01:32:51,479 --> 01:32:53,037
What will you ask Surekha?

1072
01:32:53,114 --> 01:32:56,277
Your dear Surekha wants
to tarnish Yadavs' image!

1073
01:32:56,751 --> 01:33:00,653
If Yadavs are careful then who
can tarnish their image?

1074
01:33:00,722 --> 01:33:02,212
This is what even I am saying!

1075
01:33:02,290 --> 01:33:03,450
You will surely say!

1076
01:33:04,125 --> 01:33:07,492
If that is the case then
you clear your delusion.

1077
01:33:07,562 --> 01:33:10,531
No, no, Kanhaiya! I won't
spoil her slumber.

1078
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:14,693
No, brother! You come and check out!

1079
01:33:14,769 --> 01:33:16,293
Otherwise in the future
you will blame me.

1080
01:33:16,371 --> 01:33:18,134
Who would want to be accused?

1081
01:33:18,206 --> 01:33:19,264
I don't want it!

1082
01:33:24,212 --> 01:33:25,338
Look!

1083
01:33:26,414 --> 01:33:27,472
Now are you assured?

1084
01:33:28,249 --> 01:33:30,376
That cruel man slandered
my daughter!

1085
01:33:30,985 --> 01:33:33,476
Why do you believe
somebody so easily?

1086
01:33:33,554 --> 01:33:34,612
I am a fool!

1087
01:33:34,689 --> 01:33:36,714
Softly. Surekha is sleeping,
brother.

1088
01:33:36,991 --> 01:33:39,482
You are right. Come on. Let's go.

1089
01:33:48,002 --> 01:33:49,731
Brother! Brother!
- What happened?

1090
01:33:50,271 --> 01:33:52,569
Now what will happen?
- What should happen!

1091
01:33:53,308 --> 01:33:55,105
You never let me finish
what I am saying!

1092
01:33:55,176 --> 01:33:57,474
Because I understand before
you could finish speaking.

1093
01:33:57,679 --> 01:33:59,203
What did you understand?

1094
01:33:59,280 --> 01:34:03,740
That you are craving
to meet Surekha.

1095
01:34:05,019 --> 01:34:06,418
The matter is something
else, brother.

1096
01:34:07,055 --> 01:34:09,023
Today Kauravs are coming with
the wedding procession...

1097
01:34:09,090 --> 01:34:10,216
...to marry Surekha.

1098
01:34:11,025 --> 01:34:12,652
They will return humiliated.

1099
01:34:12,727 --> 01:34:15,252
How?
- Come. I will show you.

1100
01:34:17,532 --> 01:34:19,625
Kanhaiya! Kanhaiya!

1101
01:34:20,401 --> 01:34:23,234
Gopal! Gopal!

1102
01:34:23,304 --> 01:34:24,999
What happened, brother?
- Where are you?

1103
01:34:25,073 --> 01:34:26,506
Kauravs' wedding procession
is about to arrive!

1104
01:34:26,574 --> 01:34:27,632
You don't worry.

1105
01:34:27,709 --> 01:34:30,371
All the arrangement has been
made to welcome the guests.

1106
01:34:31,980 --> 01:34:33,538
Hear that! The wedding
procession is here!

1107
01:34:33,614 --> 01:34:34,672
Come on!

1108
01:34:57,005 --> 01:34:58,199
Brother!
- What happened?

1109
01:34:58,272 --> 01:35:01,241
If we went in this attire
then we will be recognised.

1110
01:35:01,309 --> 01:35:03,368
Is that so? Close your eyes!

1111
01:35:04,579 --> 01:35:05,637
Fine!

1112
01:35:17,058 --> 01:35:18,992
We have changed completely.
- Yes, brother.

1113
01:35:20,495 --> 01:35:21,553
Come on!
- Yes!

1114
01:35:44,252 --> 01:35:46,345
Whether one is fair or blackish.

1115
01:35:46,421 --> 01:35:48,355
The lover is always crazy.

1116
01:35:48,423 --> 01:35:50,983
It's your choice whether you
want to take someone's heart.

1117
01:35:51,059 --> 01:35:53,027
Or to give away your heart.

1118
01:35:53,094 --> 01:35:55,085
Whether one is fair or blackish.

1119
01:35:55,163 --> 01:35:57,131
The lover is always crazy.

1120
01:35:57,198 --> 01:35:59,996
It's your choice whether you
want to take someone's heart.

1121
01:36:00,068 --> 01:36:02,002
Or to give away your heart.

1122
01:36:02,070 --> 01:36:05,039
Whether one is fair or blackish.

1123
01:36:19,120 --> 01:36:20,951
Someone would look at looks.

1124
01:36:21,022 --> 01:36:23,047
And someone looks at personality.

1125
01:36:23,324 --> 01:36:27,260
Everyone looks differently.

1126
01:36:27,628 --> 01:36:28,959
Someone would look at looks.

1127
01:36:29,030 --> 01:36:31,464
And someone looks at personality.

1128
01:36:31,966 --> 01:36:35,697
Everyone looks differently.

1129
01:36:36,070 --> 01:36:38,004
Everyone looks differently.

1130
01:36:38,072 --> 01:36:39,972
Everyone looks differently.

1131
01:36:40,208 --> 01:36:43,234
Whether innocent or smart.

1132
01:36:44,412 --> 01:36:46,403
Whether innocent or smart.

1133
01:36:46,481 --> 01:36:48,506
The lover is always crazy.

1134
01:36:48,583 --> 01:36:50,983
It's your choice whether you
want to take someone's heart.

1135
01:36:51,052 --> 01:36:53,043
Or to give away your heart.

1136
01:36:53,121 --> 01:36:56,090
Whether one is fair or blackish.

1137
01:37:14,742 --> 01:37:18,542
Pinkish lips or reddish cheeks.

1138
01:37:19,080 --> 01:37:22,982
One's eyes meet secretly
and the face reddens.

1139
01:37:23,317 --> 01:37:27,219
Pinkish lips or reddish cheeks.

1140
01:37:27,555 --> 01:37:31,252
One's eyes meet secretly
and the cheeks redden.

1141
01:37:31,559 --> 01:37:35,461
One's eyes meet secretly
and the cheeks redden.

1142
01:37:35,696 --> 01:37:39,132
Whether shy or bold.

1143
01:37:40,101 --> 01:37:42,069
Whether shy or bold.

1144
01:37:42,136 --> 01:37:44,104
The lover is always crazy.

1145
01:37:44,172 --> 01:37:46,640
It's your choice whether you
want to take someone's heart.

1146
01:37:46,707 --> 01:37:48,470
Or to give away your heart.

1147
01:37:48,543 --> 01:37:51,671
Whether one is fair or blackish.

1148
01:38:05,726 --> 01:38:07,091
There are thousands of buyers.

1149
01:38:07,161 --> 01:38:09,721
In the market of beauty.

1150
01:38:10,064 --> 01:38:11,998
One who is bold.

1151
01:38:12,066 --> 01:38:14,000
Finds the love he wants.

1152
01:38:14,068 --> 01:38:16,036
There are thousands of buyers.

1153
01:38:16,103 --> 01:38:18,196
In the market of beauty.

1154
01:38:18,272 --> 01:38:19,933
One who is bold.

1155
01:38:20,007 --> 01:38:22,168
Finds the love he wants.

1156
01:38:22,376 --> 01:38:24,435
Finds the love he wants.

1157
01:38:24,512 --> 01:38:26,275
Finds the love he wants.

1158
01:38:26,447 --> 01:38:29,507
One, who is unique.

1159
01:38:30,618 --> 01:38:32,518
One, who is unique.

1160
01:38:32,587 --> 01:38:34,555
The lover is always crazy.

1161
01:38:34,622 --> 01:38:36,954
It's your choice whether you
want to take someone's heart.

1162
01:38:37,024 --> 01:38:39,185
Or to give away your heart.

1163
01:38:39,260 --> 01:38:41,125
Whether one is fair or blackish.

1164
01:38:41,195 --> 01:38:43,129
The lover is always crazy.

1165
01:38:43,197 --> 01:38:45,631
It's your choice whether you
want to take someone's heart.

1166
01:38:45,700 --> 01:38:47,634
Or to give away your heart.

1167
01:38:47,702 --> 01:38:50,637
Whether one is fair or blackish.

1168
01:38:52,506 --> 01:38:53,700
Very good! Very good!

1169
01:38:53,975 --> 01:38:56,637
If the dancer here is
so good looking...

1170
01:38:56,711 --> 01:38:58,440
...the princess will be even more so.

1171
01:38:58,512 --> 01:38:59,570
Yes.

1172
01:38:59,647 --> 01:39:01,046
The moment you see her,
you'll be floored.

1173
01:39:01,115 --> 01:39:03,447
Really? Can you arrange
for me to see her?

1174
01:39:05,286 --> 01:39:07,447
If you're bold enough, I can
even show you the heaven.

1175
01:39:08,356 --> 01:39:09,653
You're so nice, brother.

1176
01:39:11,592 --> 01:39:13,560
You've met a great person.
- Huh?

1177
01:39:13,628 --> 01:39:14,720
Oh! Oh!

1178
01:39:28,509 --> 01:39:32,206
Let him come! I'll make
his life miserable.

1179
01:39:32,513 --> 01:39:34,504
How? How?! Huh!

1180
01:39:47,228 --> 01:39:49,423
Like this! Is that right?

1181
01:39:49,563 --> 01:39:52,555
Oh! You must change your voice.

1182
01:39:52,633 --> 01:39:54,965
My voice hasn't changed? I'll
change it right away.

1183
01:39:55,102 --> 01:39:57,969
Here! Darling!

1184
01:39:58,372 --> 01:39:59,430
That's perfect.

1185
01:40:00,641 --> 01:40:01,699
Look there!

1186
01:40:07,114 --> 01:40:10,049
Look, please hide behind that tree.

1187
01:40:10,217 --> 01:40:11,479
I'll welcome him.

1188
01:40:11,552 --> 01:40:12,712
You got it wrong again.

1189
01:40:13,387 --> 01:40:15,355
Not like that. Keep in
mind you're a woman.

1190
01:40:15,423 --> 01:40:16,720
Yes, I'll. I'll.

1191
01:40:38,679 --> 01:40:39,737
Excuse me!

1192
01:40:40,214 --> 01:40:41,476
Please listen!

1193
01:40:42,016 --> 01:40:43,415
Yes, tell me!

1194
01:40:45,319 --> 01:40:46,411
Who is she?

1195
01:40:46,587 --> 01:40:50,421
She? Yes.
- Princess Surekha.

1196
01:40:50,491 --> 01:40:51,753
Oh! Surekha.

1197
01:40:56,030 --> 01:40:57,554
Darling! Oh! Oh!

1198
01:41:01,235 --> 01:41:03,567
Darling! I'm prince Laxman.

1199
01:41:04,205 --> 01:41:05,536
Yours soon to be husband.

1200
01:41:06,207 --> 01:41:07,265
Sweetheart!

1201
01:41:20,054 --> 01:41:23,990
Oh! My back is gone!

1202
01:41:24,592 --> 01:41:27,561
Oh, you're very delicate, my dear.

1203
01:41:28,229 --> 01:41:30,663
But why do you taste the soil?

1204
01:41:31,132 --> 01:41:36,092
I'm not aware if I taste the
soil or the stones of love.

1205
01:41:37,004 --> 01:41:42,465
My heart is dancing with the joy
because soon you'll be my wife.

1206
01:41:44,011 --> 01:41:45,603
Can you dance, sweetheart?

1207
01:41:46,580 --> 01:41:51,074
I can dance as well as
I can make one dance.

1208
01:41:52,153 --> 01:41:56,749
Then you must congratulate yourself
for getting a husband like me.

1209
01:41:57,191 --> 01:41:59,751
Because I know music and dance.

1210
01:42:00,027 --> 01:42:03,019
And I can play the
music instruments.

1211
01:42:06,033 --> 01:42:08,092
Water! Water!

1212
01:42:09,637 --> 01:42:11,036
Are you floored, dear?

1213
01:42:12,139 --> 01:42:15,575
Where... where am I, darling?

1214
01:42:16,210 --> 01:42:20,078
Back to earth from the heavens.

1215
01:42:21,649 --> 01:42:25,085
Shall I go now, o beauty? Shall I?

1216
01:42:26,720 --> 01:42:32,659
Please stay for a while. You'll be
sent on the shoulders of 4 men.

1217
01:42:35,196 --> 01:42:37,494
I don't have time, dear.

1218
01:42:38,199 --> 01:42:41,999
My uncle must be waiting
for me with cereal food.

1219
01:42:42,336 --> 01:42:44,736
Please wait, dear.
- Yes.

1220
01:42:45,272 --> 01:42:47,672
At least, let me be at your feet.

1221
01:42:48,642 --> 01:42:50,576
You'll live a happy married life.

1222
01:42:50,644 --> 01:42:51,736
Ouch!

1223
01:43:02,056 --> 01:43:03,114
Oh!

1224
01:43:47,001 --> 01:43:48,059
Brother!

1225
01:43:49,670 --> 01:43:51,661
Brother, did you see the
condition of the groom?

1226
01:43:52,206 --> 01:43:54,003
But what do we stand to
gain from it, brother?

1227
01:43:54,074 --> 01:43:57,305
Oh, when the groom runs away,
you'll get the bride, brother.

1228
01:43:57,745 --> 01:44:00,009
The sweet dreams do not get
you anywhere, brother.

1229
01:44:00,080 --> 01:44:03,243
The sweets? That's a good
thing to talk about.

1230
01:44:03,317 --> 01:44:07,185
Please go to your place now. I'll
come after eating something.

1231
01:44:07,254 --> 01:44:10,451
But brother, do you want
me to stay hungry?

1232
01:44:11,225 --> 01:44:13,318
Brother, you'll also get something.

1233
01:44:13,394 --> 01:44:14,452
How?

1234
01:44:14,528 --> 01:44:16,587
How?! You'll see now. Don't worry.

1235
01:44:25,072 --> 01:44:26,562
Ah! Ah!

1236
01:44:26,640 --> 01:44:27,698
Who are you?

1237
01:44:27,975 --> 01:44:29,033
Are you all blind people?

1238
01:44:30,477 --> 01:44:33,605
Can't you see such a big person?

1239
01:44:35,015 --> 01:44:36,073
Fools?

1240
01:44:36,150 --> 01:44:37,208
What did you say? Fools?

1241
01:48:07,528 --> 01:48:09,655
Oh! The food has vanished, the
dishes and utensils too.

1242
01:48:09,730 --> 01:48:10,992
Everything has vanished.

1243
01:48:11,064 --> 01:48:12,156
Let's go to inform the king.

1244
01:48:51,505 --> 01:48:52,563
Oh!

1245
01:48:54,541 --> 01:48:56,600
Oh! All the clothes
have vanished away?

1246
01:48:57,144 --> 01:48:58,202
Let's inform the king.

1247
01:50:19,459 --> 01:50:21,984
Whether this marriage
takes place or not...

1248
01:50:22,062 --> 01:50:24,121
...I can never tolerate
myself to be insulted.

1249
01:50:24,564 --> 01:50:26,225
Who has insulted you?

1250
01:50:26,300 --> 01:50:27,528
The residents of Dwarka.

1251
01:50:28,168 --> 01:50:30,329
In spite of the fact that there
was so much security...

1252
01:50:30,404 --> 01:50:32,668
...they stole the clothing
and jewellery from there.

1253
01:50:33,206 --> 01:50:36,198
Really? Then it is
a shameful matter.

1254
01:50:36,276 --> 01:50:38,005
A few of the thieves from Dwarka...

1255
01:50:38,078 --> 01:50:43,141
...stole away everything
from the kaurava's?

1256
01:50:43,216 --> 01:50:48,210
Don't worry, Krinshna. We'll buy
new clothing and jewellery.

1257
01:50:48,522 --> 01:50:50,353
If you don't have any money,
I'll give it to you.

1258
01:50:50,424 --> 01:50:53,757
Krishna! We're not beggars. We have
come to get our son married.

1259
01:50:54,394 --> 01:50:56,760
I wish you all the best,
king of Kuru.

1260
01:50:59,299 --> 01:51:01,767
Brother, why are you making
me hot with jealousy?

1261
01:51:03,236 --> 01:51:06,171
Drink some cold water. Your
heart will get cool.

1262
01:51:06,239 --> 01:51:09,504
I like neither your kidding nor
any other work that you do.

1263
01:51:10,177 --> 01:51:14,045
Oh, listen! Today I've done
something so that there...

1264
01:51:14,114 --> 01:51:17,481
...surely will be a fight between
the Kaurava's and the Yadava's.

1265
01:51:18,418 --> 01:51:20,386
What such magic have you done?

1266
01:51:20,454 --> 01:51:22,183
I've done a great favour to you.

1267
01:51:22,255 --> 01:51:26,715
I've misplaced the clothing and
jewellery of the Kaurava's.

1268
01:51:26,994 --> 01:51:28,291
They'll buy new ones.

1269
01:51:28,362 --> 01:51:29,420
That's what I want.

1270
01:51:42,009 --> 01:51:43,067
Why have you stopped, brother?

1271
01:51:43,143 --> 01:51:45,008
Let's change our appearance first.

1272
01:51:45,078 --> 01:51:46,136
Why?

1273
01:51:46,213 --> 01:51:47,271
I'll tell you later.

1274
01:51:54,755 --> 01:51:57,747
Brother, we're looking like traders.

1275
01:51:58,125 --> 01:51:59,183
Yes, brother.

1276
01:52:00,027 --> 01:52:01,085
Now look here.

1277
01:52:20,981 --> 01:52:22,107
What is this, brother?

1278
01:52:23,150 --> 01:52:24,412
This is the magic market.

1279
01:52:24,484 --> 01:52:26,076
Magic market?
- Yes.

1280
01:52:26,453 --> 01:52:28,284
But all the shops are empty?

1281
01:52:28,355 --> 01:52:30,380
Oh, really? I'll fill
them right away.

1282
01:52:41,001 --> 01:52:42,491
And the rest of the shops?

1283
01:52:42,569 --> 01:52:44,730
Just see! I'll furnish
them right away.

1284
01:53:25,245 --> 01:53:27,645
Brother, you've filled
the shops very well.

1285
01:53:28,215 --> 01:53:30,615
But who will manage these shops?

1286
01:53:31,985 --> 01:53:33,043
Shop-owners!

1287
01:53:33,653 --> 01:53:34,711
Where will they come from?

1288
01:53:35,021 --> 01:53:36,420
I'll arrange for them.

1289
01:53:36,490 --> 01:53:37,548
Really?

1290
01:53:37,624 --> 01:53:39,489
Yes, brother. Now go to
the kaurava's place.

1291
01:53:39,559 --> 01:53:40,617
Bring them here with you.

1292
01:53:41,495 --> 01:53:43,986
Be careful. No one should
recognise you.

1293
01:53:44,064 --> 01:53:47,158
Don't worry, brother. I'll
bring them right away.

1294
01:53:47,234 --> 01:53:48,292
Okay.

1295
01:53:58,278 --> 01:53:59,472
You go to the jewellery shop.

1296
01:54:02,749 --> 01:54:05,013
And you go to the of weaponry shop.

1297
01:54:20,167 --> 01:54:21,634
You go to the textile shop.

1298
01:54:25,705 --> 01:54:28,037
And you go to the utensil's shop.

1299
01:54:34,414 --> 01:54:36,006
You go to the shoe shop.

1300
01:54:38,185 --> 01:54:40,244
And you go to the fruit shop.

1301
01:54:49,329 --> 01:54:51,388
You go to the sweet seller's shop.

1302
01:54:54,434 --> 01:54:56,561
And you go to the florist shop.

1303
01:54:58,738 --> 01:55:01,332
Look, this is the market.
It's a lovely market.

1304
01:55:01,408 --> 01:55:02,466
Yes, yes.

1305
01:55:02,542 --> 01:55:03,600
This is the fruit shop.

1306
01:55:05,011 --> 01:55:06,672
Welcome, uncle, welcome.

1307
01:55:06,746 --> 01:55:08,509
We're lucky to get an opportunity
to serve you.

1308
01:55:08,582 --> 01:55:11,642
Oh, but how do you know me, trader?

1309
01:55:12,118 --> 01:55:14,643
Uncle, along with the Kaurava's,
I've heard about you too.

1310
01:55:14,721 --> 01:55:17,554
Oh! So you've put up
such a big market?

1311
01:55:17,624 --> 01:55:22,061
I'll call it a market from where
the Pandava's have brought things.

1312
01:55:22,429 --> 01:55:24,260
We're not any less
than the Pandava's.

1313
01:55:24,331 --> 01:55:26,959
Yes, you're right, Duryodhana,
announce that everyone...

1314
01:55:27,033 --> 01:55:29,695
...should buy anything that he likes.

1315
01:55:29,970 --> 01:55:32,131
And our fathers will foot the bill.

1316
01:55:32,205 --> 01:55:34,571
Not our fathers, dear.
Say my father.

1317
01:55:35,408 --> 01:55:37,638
If he doesn't, his father
will pay for it.

1318
01:55:37,711 --> 01:55:38,973
Shut up!

1319
01:55:39,045 --> 01:55:40,103
Did you say something to me, father?

1320
01:55:40,180 --> 01:55:41,374
Shut up! Keep quiet.

1321
01:55:41,448 --> 01:55:42,506
Yes.

1322
01:55:42,582 --> 01:55:46,245
I order you to take
whatever you like.

1323
01:55:46,319 --> 01:55:47,411
I'll pay for it.

1324
01:55:48,521 --> 01:55:49,579
Go.

1325
01:55:56,129 --> 01:55:57,391
This necklace looks so beautiful.

1326
01:55:57,464 --> 01:56:00,490
If you see it in mirror,
you'll dance with joy.

1327
01:56:00,567 --> 01:56:02,000
Please give it to me.

1328
01:56:02,068 --> 01:56:03,126
Take it.

1329
01:56:43,510 --> 01:56:45,239
Here, take it.

1330
01:56:45,312 --> 01:56:46,370
Take it.

1331
01:56:46,446 --> 01:56:47,572
The watermelon!

1332
01:56:48,048 --> 01:56:49,106
Stay here!

1333
01:56:54,721 --> 01:56:58,157
Take your payment. It's surely a
lot more than what Pandava's paid.

1334
01:56:58,224 --> 01:56:59,589
Not any less. Count if you want.

1335
01:56:59,659 --> 01:57:03,288
No! There's no need. I've
full faith in you.

1336
01:57:03,997 --> 01:57:05,658
Take this for you, trader.

1337
01:57:06,599 --> 01:57:07,998
When you remember about
our generosity...

1338
01:57:08,068 --> 01:57:10,662
...you'll bow your head
with reverence to us.

1339
01:57:10,737 --> 01:57:13,069
Uncle, you too will
remember us a lot.

1340
01:57:13,506 --> 01:57:15,497
Anyways, we're very good traders.

1341
01:57:15,575 --> 01:57:17,167
Yes, why not? Why not?

1342
01:57:19,179 --> 01:57:21,477
Uncle! They'll not prosper in trade.

1343
01:57:21,548 --> 01:57:23,106
Why?
- Because they don't count.

1344
01:57:36,963 --> 01:57:38,021
All of them have gone.

1345
01:57:39,499 --> 01:57:42,468
That's okay, but what happens next?

1346
01:57:42,535 --> 01:57:45,561
What happens? They will be ruined?

1347
01:57:45,638 --> 01:57:47,128
All of them will be ruined?

1348
01:57:47,207 --> 01:57:48,970
Yes. All of them. Let's go.

1349
01:58:18,938 --> 01:58:20,530
Whether you agree with me or not...

1350
01:58:20,607 --> 01:58:22,131
...l'm sure, something
is wrong inside.

1351
01:58:22,208 --> 01:58:23,607
Is that so? Come on,
let's go and see.

1352
01:58:29,616 --> 01:58:31,243
Oh? Where are the utensils?

1353
01:58:33,019 --> 01:58:34,077
Nothing is here, too!

1354
01:58:34,154 --> 01:58:36,054
Not here! Not here!

1355
01:58:37,056 --> 01:58:38,114
Did someone come from the window?

1356
01:58:38,458 --> 01:58:39,516
It's a miracle that has happened.

1357
01:58:39,592 --> 01:58:40,991
Come on, let's inform them.

1358
01:59:05,518 --> 01:59:07,213
Huh! Now where will it go?

1359
01:59:17,397 --> 01:59:20,264
Ah! What's this? It has ran away?

1360
01:59:41,554 --> 01:59:44,148
Look! I brought such a lovely
necklace for you.

1361
01:59:53,967 --> 01:59:55,025
Ouch!

1362
01:59:55,101 --> 01:59:56,159
Oh!

1363
02:00:08,481 --> 02:00:10,506
Ouch! Oh!

1364
02:00:14,153 --> 02:00:15,211
Ah! Ah!!

1365
02:00:15,288 --> 02:00:17,153
Lovely! Very lovely!

1366
02:00:17,724 --> 02:00:22,661
What a pair. My father would never
have got such lovely pair.

1367
02:00:23,096 --> 02:00:26,224
I'll wear it, and I'll
go to the bride.

1368
02:00:30,036 --> 02:00:31,094
Ah!?

1369
02:00:31,170 --> 02:00:34,401
Who can't wait to meet the bride?
It's you or it's me?

1370
02:00:34,474 --> 02:00:37,204
Eh! All right. Let's go together.

1371
02:00:38,211 --> 02:00:40,611
Oh! So both of us are longing to go.

1372
02:00:40,680 --> 02:00:42,011
Doesn't matter. Let's go.

1373
02:00:42,749 --> 02:00:45,081
Eh! Why are you running away?

1374
02:00:45,151 --> 02:00:46,243
Wait, wait for me.

1375
02:00:50,590 --> 02:00:55,254
All right! Now I know what to do.

1376
02:00:57,330 --> 02:00:59,457
Where will you run away now?

1377
02:01:00,033 --> 02:01:03,025
What do you think
of me? Am I a fool?

1378
02:01:03,102 --> 02:01:05,570
You're trying to harass me?

1379
02:01:06,639 --> 02:01:07,697
Oh!

1380
02:01:07,774 --> 02:01:09,036
Oh!

1381
02:01:10,443 --> 02:01:12,308
These are very strange
slippery shoes.

1382
02:01:34,734 --> 02:01:35,996
Ouch!

1383
02:01:36,569 --> 02:01:37,627
So finally you're tired?

1384
02:01:39,572 --> 02:01:41,540
What's this? Now you've
begun your drama?

1385
02:01:41,608 --> 02:01:43,542
Wait, I'll put you right.

1386
02:01:48,181 --> 02:01:52,140
Ah? So now you came this way?

1387
02:01:52,218 --> 02:01:53,276
Wait!

1388
02:01:57,090 --> 02:01:58,148
Oh, you both!

1389
02:01:58,224 --> 02:02:02,752
I say, get lost. And now you.

1390
02:02:08,334 --> 02:02:10,029
Now I'll take some rest.

1391
02:02:31,290 --> 02:02:33,656
Friends, they may perhaps
think of us as groom...

1392
02:02:33,726 --> 02:02:35,455
...as we've put on these clothes.

1393
02:02:35,728 --> 02:02:39,357
Don't talk nonsense.
Come on, let's play.

1394
02:02:42,235 --> 02:02:43,293
The necklace!

1395
02:02:46,606 --> 02:02:48,267
Oh! The jewellery and clothes...
all have vanished.

1396
02:02:49,542 --> 02:02:50,600
Very astounding!

1397
02:02:50,677 --> 02:02:52,201
Let's go and inform the king.

1398
02:02:52,278 --> 02:02:53,336
Come on.

1399
02:02:54,514 --> 02:02:57,244
Krishna! I'll create
havoc in Dwarka.

1400
02:02:57,684 --> 02:03:00,346
Kuru King, why do you have
to take the trouble?

1401
02:03:00,420 --> 02:03:02,285
Because of your deceit.

1402
02:03:03,122 --> 02:03:07,491
Look in the mirror and repeat
these words, uncle.

1403
02:03:07,560 --> 02:03:11,428
We have taken a decision after
thinking a lot about it.

1404
02:03:12,031 --> 02:03:14,761
Do you want our relationship
with Balarama to suffer?

1405
02:03:15,702 --> 02:03:16,964
What proof do you have?

1406
02:03:17,036 --> 02:03:19,027
What is the need for proof?

1407
02:03:19,105 --> 02:03:20,163
Duryodhan!

1408
02:03:20,707 --> 02:03:21,969
Master!

1409
02:03:22,408 --> 02:03:25,036
Do you want to create a rift
between Krishna and Balarama?

1410
02:03:25,978 --> 02:03:27,969
Don't you forget that though
we've two bodies...

1411
02:03:28,047 --> 02:03:29,537
...we have a single soul.

1412
02:03:29,615 --> 02:03:30,673
Master!

1413
02:03:31,718 --> 02:03:33,083
Now this marriage is cancelled.

1414
02:03:33,152 --> 02:03:34,642
Go back with your people.

1415
02:03:36,656 --> 02:03:39,989
Great warrior, Balarama, to break
such a long time close...

1416
02:03:40,059 --> 02:03:44,086
...relationship for such
a small matter...

1417
02:03:45,598 --> 02:03:47,725
It will not do any
good to your image.

1418
02:03:48,301 --> 02:03:52,499
Though it is selfish talk, what
uncle is saying is such a sweet talk.

1419
02:03:54,507 --> 02:03:57,533
I, too, am a good player, Krishna.

1420
02:03:59,278 --> 02:04:02,008
Yes, brother Balarama, we
are so close friends.

1421
02:04:02,081 --> 02:04:05,050
The wedding should be performed
as soon as possible.

1422
02:04:05,518 --> 02:04:07,748
What uncle says is perfectly
right, brother.

1423
02:04:10,189 --> 02:04:12,054
Your magic was useless, brother.

1424
02:04:12,125 --> 02:04:14,593
Don't lose your heart. You'll
soon see what I'll do.

1425
02:04:14,660 --> 02:04:17,595
You'll just give talks and
the bride will get married.

1426
02:04:17,663 --> 02:04:19,688
The bride won't get married.
She will be kidnapped.

1427
02:04:20,299 --> 02:04:21,459
You'll have to do this job.

1428
02:04:22,068 --> 02:04:23,126
How can I?

1429
02:04:23,202 --> 02:04:24,260
Come with me.

1430
02:04:25,705 --> 02:04:26,967
Why have you come here?

1431
02:04:27,039 --> 02:04:28,506
For bridal make up.

1432
02:04:28,574 --> 02:04:30,508
For bridal make-up?
Get lost at once.

1433
02:04:35,381 --> 02:04:37,713
Haven't you heard me?
Get out! Run away!

1434
02:04:42,722 --> 02:04:47,056
Surekha is lucky to get a good
family and a good groom.

1435
02:04:47,126 --> 02:04:48,184
What do you say, Revati?

1436
02:04:48,261 --> 02:04:49,387
Yes.

1437
02:05:07,113 --> 02:05:08,171
Mother!

1438
02:05:11,384 --> 02:05:12,442
Surekha!

1439
02:05:15,121 --> 02:05:16,679
Father! Mother!

1440
02:05:19,692 --> 02:05:22,126
How are you so energetic,
today, all of a sudden?

1441
02:05:22,195 --> 02:05:23,685
Mother, today I'm very happy.

1442
02:05:24,263 --> 02:05:26,254
I've given up thinking
about Abhimanyu.

1443
02:05:26,332 --> 02:05:29,028
That's good, dear.
Now get ready soon.

1444
02:05:29,101 --> 02:05:30,398
Come on; let's go to
the wedding pavilion.

1445
02:05:36,609 --> 02:05:37,667
Why are you roaming here and there?

1446
02:05:38,077 --> 02:05:39,374
Go and prepare Surekha for wedding.

1447
02:05:41,147 --> 02:05:42,205
What are you looking at?

1448
02:05:42,281 --> 02:05:46,081
Princess! She is here and there too!

1449
02:05:46,586 --> 02:05:47,644
What do you mean?

1450
02:05:48,354 --> 02:05:50,117
We just came from Princess's room.

1451
02:05:50,423 --> 02:05:51,651
Have you gone mad?

1452
02:05:51,724 --> 02:05:54,124
Surekha is one, not two.

1453
02:05:54,193 --> 02:05:56,991
Go and get her ready for wedding.

1454
02:05:58,664 --> 02:05:59,722
Go!

1455
02:06:02,435 --> 02:06:03,732
All of them are stupid.

1456
02:06:05,104 --> 02:06:07,402
Surekha is there. How
can she be here?

1457
02:06:08,407 --> 02:06:09,465
Let's go.

1458
02:06:20,186 --> 02:06:22,381
I said no once, but still
you've come back?

1459
02:06:22,955 --> 02:06:24,013
Get lost!

1460
02:06:24,523 --> 02:06:28,425
Oh! Prince!

1461
02:06:32,031 --> 02:06:33,089
I never imagined.

1462
02:06:33,165 --> 02:06:37,534
Surekha, I'm so smitten by you that
I can't stay away from you.

1463
02:06:38,337 --> 02:06:42,501
What will happen now? Father
is marrying me off forcibly.

1464
02:06:43,075 --> 02:06:46,169
Don't worry, Surekha. Let's
run away from here.

1465
02:06:47,480 --> 02:06:48,538
Come with me, Surekha.

1466
02:07:10,736 --> 02:07:13,534
How can I go alone?

1467
02:07:13,606 --> 02:07:16,541
I'm so shy a girl.

1468
02:07:17,176 --> 02:07:19,576
How can I go alone?

1469
02:07:19,645 --> 02:07:22,580
I'm so shy a girl.

1470
02:07:23,316 --> 02:07:27,116
I'm so delicate.

1471
02:07:27,553 --> 02:07:31,455
I am so afraid to walk.

1472
02:07:31,691 --> 02:07:37,095
Don't let go of my hand,
I'm so shy.

1473
02:07:38,064 --> 02:07:40,464
How can I go alone?

1474
02:07:40,700 --> 02:07:43,601
I'm so shy a girl.

1475
02:08:00,686 --> 02:08:02,654
The weather is so lovely.

1476
02:08:02,722 --> 02:08:04,622
The wedding music has begun.

1477
02:08:05,024 --> 02:08:08,721
Why have I grown up so soon?

1478
02:08:13,165 --> 02:08:15,190
The weather is so lovely.

1479
02:08:15,267 --> 02:08:17,132
The wedding music has begun.

1480
02:08:17,203 --> 02:08:21,071
Why have I grown up so soon?

1481
02:08:21,474 --> 02:08:23,408
My eyes are wandering.

1482
02:08:23,476 --> 02:08:25,376
I've begun singing tunes.

1483
02:08:25,444 --> 02:08:29,175
When I look in a mirror,
I feel shy.

1484
02:08:29,949 --> 02:08:33,680
I won't remove my veil.

1485
02:08:33,986 --> 02:08:36,477
I'm a mystery to myself.

1486
02:08:36,555 --> 02:08:39,353
I'm so shy a girl.

1487
02:08:40,159 --> 02:08:42,684
I'm a mystery to myself.

1488
02:08:42,962 --> 02:08:45,453
I'm so shy a girl.

1489
02:08:46,399 --> 02:08:48,959
How can I go alone?

1490
02:08:49,035 --> 02:08:52,027
I'm so shy a girl.

1491
02:09:09,321 --> 02:09:11,152
My lips are pink.

1492
02:09:11,223 --> 02:09:13,248
My eyes are sheepish.

1493
02:09:13,325 --> 02:09:17,591
And I wear silk clothing.

1494
02:09:21,934 --> 02:09:23,561
My lips are pink.

1495
02:09:23,636 --> 02:09:25,536
My eyes are sheepish.

1496
02:09:25,938 --> 02:09:29,601
And I wear silk clothing.

1497
02:09:30,109 --> 02:09:32,009
I'm feeling dreamy.

1498
02:09:32,078 --> 02:09:34,012
I call you out in dreams.

1499
02:09:34,080 --> 02:09:37,982
Let me keep on dreaming.

1500
02:09:38,050 --> 02:09:40,450
'I'll put on anklets.

1501
02:09:40,519 --> 02:09:42,384
I'll wait for my sweetheart.

1502
02:09:42,455 --> 02:09:45,219
I'll become a bride.

1503
02:09:45,291 --> 02:09:47,953
I'm so shy a girl.

1504
02:09:48,627 --> 02:09:51,255
I'll become a bride.

1505
02:09:51,330 --> 02:09:54,128
I'm so shy a girl.

1506
02:09:55,034 --> 02:09:57,502
How can I go alone?

1507
02:09:57,570 --> 02:10:00,698
I'm so shy a girl.

1508
02:10:11,550 --> 02:10:12,608
Oh! Ouch!

1509
02:10:15,221 --> 02:10:18,349
Princess, how have you
become so heavy?

1510
02:10:18,424 --> 02:10:20,187
Is it because you're so happy
to meet your beloved?

1511
02:10:20,259 --> 02:10:21,988
When one wants to meet
her beloved the mind...

1512
02:10:22,061 --> 02:10:24,495
...is dancing and the
body becomes light.

1513
02:10:25,564 --> 02:10:28,556
Ganga! Jamuna! Sita!

1514
02:10:30,436 --> 02:10:32,495
Oh, what happened to my daughter?

1515
02:10:33,639 --> 02:10:34,697
Nothing, mother!

1516
02:10:35,341 --> 02:10:36,638
What are you doing until now?

1517
02:10:36,709 --> 02:10:38,677
We're getting the princess
ready, queen!

1518
02:10:38,744 --> 02:10:42,236
Okay. Dear Surekha, please
get ready soon.

1519
02:10:42,314 --> 02:10:43,372
Yes.

1520
02:10:52,224 --> 02:10:53,282
Uncle!

1521
02:10:53,359 --> 02:10:57,318
Where are you running away,
hiding from me, nephew!

1522
02:10:59,165 --> 02:11:01,190
Oh, no, uncle.

1523
02:11:01,534 --> 02:11:03,525
Are you trying to hoodwink me, too?

1524
02:11:04,336 --> 02:11:06,361
No, uncle. The matter is...

1525
02:11:06,438 --> 02:11:07,598
Never mind. I know it all.

1526
02:11:08,474 --> 02:11:11,272
You cannot take Surekha away
before you marry her.

1527
02:11:11,343 --> 02:11:12,401
Uncle!

1528
02:11:12,478 --> 02:11:14,105
Both of you go to my room.

1529
02:11:14,180 --> 02:11:15,374
I'll come very soon.

1530
02:11:33,232 --> 02:11:36,724
I'll take care of the job over
here. You take care there.

1531
02:11:38,671 --> 02:11:39,729
Surekha!

1532
02:11:40,005 --> 02:11:42,337
Rukmini, you had gone to
meet Kanhaiyya, right?

1533
02:11:42,408 --> 02:11:45,002
No. I had gone to bring these maids.

1534
02:11:45,077 --> 02:11:47,307
Oh, so where is Krishna?

1535
02:11:47,379 --> 02:11:48,744
I'm here, sister-in-law.

1536
02:11:49,081 --> 02:11:53,450
I've a single life, but I've to look
after things here and there too.

1537
02:11:53,519 --> 02:11:55,009
What work do you have there?

1538
02:11:55,087 --> 02:11:57,555
I mean, inside house
and outside house.

1539
02:11:58,057 --> 02:11:59,285
Who else will do it?

1540
02:12:00,359 --> 02:12:02,759
After all, your dear niece
is getting married.

1541
02:12:03,128 --> 02:12:04,686
Yes, come soon. We are getting late.

1542
02:12:07,132 --> 02:12:08,565
Your happiness is our happiness.

1543
02:12:10,302 --> 02:12:13,032
You must follow the values of
Yadav Dynasty faithfully...

1544
02:12:13,105 --> 02:12:15,972
Do your duty faithfully,
and live like a good...

1545
02:12:16,041 --> 02:12:19,306
...daughter-in-law and keep
the honour of your parents.

1546
02:12:19,979 --> 02:12:22,971
I'll follow your order faithfully.

1547
02:12:24,717 --> 02:12:28,084
It's good for you and for everyone.

1548
02:12:29,154 --> 02:12:35,992
I hope that you'll serve faithfully
uncle Shakuni, King...

1549
02:12:36,061 --> 02:12:42,261
...Duryodhan and all elders
in your in-laws family.

1550
02:12:43,002 --> 02:12:44,993
My blessings will always
remain with you.

1551
02:13:10,763 --> 02:13:13,254
Ah! Ah!

1552
02:13:24,710 --> 02:13:28,544
Father, she is not Surekha,
she is some Demon.

1553
02:13:28,614 --> 02:13:31,708
Laxmana, you must
get married to her.

1554
02:13:32,985 --> 02:13:34,179
But if something happens...

1555
02:13:34,453 --> 02:13:36,444
Everything will be
all right, Laxmana.

1556
02:13:37,423 --> 02:13:38,481
Then it's okay.

1557
02:13:38,991 --> 02:13:40,458
Please go dear.

1558
02:13:41,026 --> 02:13:42,550
I'll go.
- Yes, please go.

1559
02:14:16,295 --> 02:14:17,353
O God!

1560
02:14:17,429 --> 02:14:19,522
Uncle! Please save me!

1561
02:14:19,598 --> 02:14:21,031
Laxmana! What has happened now?

1562
02:14:21,100 --> 02:14:23,625
She is not Surekha.
She is an old woman.

1563
02:14:24,636 --> 02:14:25,694
Huh!

1564
02:14:30,042 --> 02:14:32,237
Laxmana! Please don't
act like a kid.

1565
02:14:32,644 --> 02:14:34,111
You must get married to her.

1566
02:14:34,179 --> 02:14:35,976
There are other girls, too, father!

1567
02:14:36,482 --> 02:14:37,540
Shameless!

1568
02:14:37,616 --> 02:14:38,674
I'm one since a long time.

1569
02:14:38,984 --> 02:14:41,009
Dear, please go and sit there.

1570
02:14:41,086 --> 02:14:42,986
Why won't you go and
sit there, uncle?

1571
02:14:43,055 --> 02:14:44,113
Stop your nonsense!

1572
02:14:44,189 --> 02:14:45,247
Laxmana! Go!

1573
02:15:10,315 --> 02:15:12,146
Ouch! Uncle, please save me!

1574
02:15:12,217 --> 02:15:13,616
Save me! Save me!

1575
02:15:15,120 --> 02:15:17,111
Uncle, she is a tigress.

1576
02:15:19,291 --> 02:15:21,418
This stupid boy is slandering
my daughter.

1577
02:15:21,693 --> 02:15:24,025
Duryodhan, take the marriage
procession back.

1578
02:15:24,096 --> 02:15:25,256
This wedding is cancelled.

1579
02:15:26,698 --> 02:15:29,360
You must not take a child
seriously, Balarama.

1580
02:15:29,435 --> 02:15:31,699
I've tolerated this
quite a lot, uncle!

1581
02:15:32,204 --> 02:15:33,967
I know it, Balarama.

1582
02:15:35,174 --> 02:15:38,371
Son, please go soon. One shouldn't
be afraid on such occasions.

1583
02:15:38,710 --> 02:15:39,972
Go.

1584
02:15:40,045 --> 02:15:41,103
Okay.

1585
02:15:44,049 --> 02:15:45,107
Priest!

1586
02:15:56,228 --> 02:15:57,286
Bless you!

1587
02:15:59,998 --> 02:16:03,456
ShriKrishana, you too bless
the couple, please.

1588
02:16:04,169 --> 02:16:09,505
I can bless the groom, but
how can I bless the bride?

1589
02:16:10,576 --> 02:16:13,409
Why? Isn't Surekha your niece?

1590
02:16:13,479 --> 02:16:16,971
Surekha is my niece, but
he is not Surekha.

1591
02:16:18,050 --> 02:16:19,108
What are you talking about?

1592
02:16:19,585 --> 02:16:20,677
She is not Surekha?

1593
02:16:20,953 --> 02:16:23,217
No! Surekha is here.

1594
02:16:23,589 --> 02:16:25,682
If you dare, you can fight me.

1595
02:16:30,062 --> 02:16:31,120
So, who are you?

1596
02:16:31,196 --> 02:16:32,254
I?

1597
02:16:54,086 --> 02:16:57,419
Dushshasan, follow him; I'll
take care of this demon.

1598
02:17:09,301 --> 02:17:10,427
What is going on here?

1599
02:17:10,502 --> 02:17:12,732
Everything is all right, brother.
I'll explain everything to you.

1600
02:17:32,224 --> 02:17:33,691
Ouch!

1601
02:17:34,126 --> 02:17:35,218
Where are you running away?

1602
02:17:35,294 --> 02:17:36,352
Catch him!

1603
02:18:11,196 --> 02:18:12,356
Brother!!

1604
02:19:17,529 --> 02:19:18,587
Brother!

1605
02:19:19,331 --> 02:19:21,663
Hey, don't worry. Come up!

1606
02:19:46,591 --> 02:19:48,616
Sister, my dear son is coming.

1607
02:19:52,197 --> 02:19:55,530
Abhimanyu! Surekha is
with him, sister!

1608
02:19:58,537 --> 02:19:59,595
Mother!

1609
02:20:10,215 --> 02:20:11,273
Greetings, mother.

1610
02:20:11,349 --> 02:20:12,407
Bless you, son!

1611
02:20:12,484 --> 02:20:13,974
Greetings, aunt!
- Bless you, son!

1612
02:20:14,052 --> 02:20:16,077
Mother!
- Surekha! My dear!

1613
02:20:17,389 --> 02:20:18,447
Ghatotkach!

1614
02:20:26,298 --> 02:20:27,356
Mother!

1615
02:20:28,600 --> 02:20:30,397
Greeting, mother.
- Bless you, son.

1616
02:20:30,469 --> 02:20:31,993
I had told you, aunt, when we
went that, though now only...

1617
02:20:32,070 --> 02:20:34,368
...two of us are going, and
three of us will come back.

1618
02:20:34,439 --> 02:20:38,307
Mother, if brother hadn't come,
I'd have been in trouble.

1619
02:20:38,376 --> 02:20:41,243
If something had to happen, I'd
have destroyed the Kaurava's.

1620
02:20:41,613 --> 02:20:45,014
And yes, mother, brother,
made the life of...

1621
02:20:45,083 --> 02:20:48,450
...that groom very miserable.

1622
02:20:49,387 --> 02:20:52,015
If we had no relationship
with them, aunt...

1623
02:20:52,090 --> 02:20:54,149
...then I'd have destroyed
the Dwarka completely.

1624
02:20:56,762 --> 02:20:58,662
Oh, who is he?

1625
02:21:00,031 --> 02:21:01,328
Soon you'll know it.

1626
02:21:01,399 --> 02:21:05,028
Hey Ghatotkach, you couldn't
even lift my hand there...

1627
02:21:05,103 --> 02:21:07,663
...but you're boasting so much here?

1628
02:21:07,739 --> 02:21:10,572
I didn't know that you'd
come here, too, uncle!

1629
02:21:10,642 --> 02:21:13,270
You must understand it, my nephew!

1630
02:21:13,345 --> 02:21:16,075
Ghatotkach, from where have
you brought a brother for me?

1631
02:21:16,148 --> 02:21:17,979
You must try to understand, aunt!

1632
02:21:18,049 --> 02:21:19,414
But... who is he?

1633
02:21:19,484 --> 02:21:22,282
He is a great magician.
He has many names.

1634
02:21:22,354 --> 02:21:23,582
He has many aliases.

1635
02:21:24,156 --> 02:21:25,589
People call him a naughty boy.

1636
02:21:26,158 --> 02:21:27,216
Naughty boy?

1637
02:21:27,292 --> 02:21:28,350
Yes.

1638
02:21:28,426 --> 02:21:29,484
Kanhaiyya (Krishna)?

1639
02:21:38,570 --> 02:21:42,097
Uncle! I didn't recognise
you at all in this alias.

1640
02:21:42,507 --> 02:21:46,273
How can you, daughter?
But whatever...

1641
02:21:46,344 --> 02:21:48,471
you wanted has happened. Right?

1642
02:21:48,547 --> 02:21:50,481
Uncle, you're so naughty!

1643
02:21:51,082 --> 02:21:55,542
Really, brother, it's difficult
to know anything about you.

1644
02:21:55,620 --> 02:21:57,417
What is your real identity, uncle?

1645
02:21:59,324 --> 02:22:03,021
My real identity? Look here.

1646
02:22:08,600 --> 02:22:17,008
'Whenever the religion
is in trouble.

1647
02:22:17,075 --> 02:22:26,177
I take birth and
look after the world.
