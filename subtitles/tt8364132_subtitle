00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:59,935
I'm on the way Mom.
Just 5 minutes away from home.

20
00:04:00,685 --> 00:04:04,102
I'm almost there,
but it's raining

21
00:04:04,102 --> 00:04:07,268
There was lot of
work.That's why the delay

OK Mom

35
00:04:47,768 --> 00:04:50,185
Mom did you take your pills?

36
00:04:59,852 --> 00:05:02,393
You Bloody...
Are you blind?

37
00:05:02,393 --> 00:05:03,977
Bike's wasted

38
00:05:30,893 --> 00:05:33,352
Sir, I work in the bar nearby..

39
00:05:33,352 --> 00:05:35,102
I was going home
after work

40
00:05:35,102 --> 00:05:37,310
A bike came opposite me
and I skidded and fell down.

41
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,310
Note it down

42
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,060
Then when I looked here he
was murdered in the car

43
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:43,310
He fell from there Sir.
I was shocked and called you Sir

44
00:05:46,227 --> 00:05:47,477
Hello Sir

45
00:05:47,643 --> 00:05:50,227
Did you Inform us about the incident?
- Yes Sir

46
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,560
Murthy...
- Sir.

47
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:53,268
Are there any cases on him?

48
00:05:53,268 --> 00:05:54,810
Nothing of that sort sir

49
00:05:54,852 --> 00:05:56,810
Just minor incidents
in the Bar,that's it.

50
00:05:56,852 --> 00:05:57,935
OK

51
00:06:06,977 --> 00:06:08,810
What were you doing
here, so late?

52
00:06:08,852 --> 00:06:11,102
I was going home, after
work in the bar

53
00:06:11,102 --> 00:06:12,810
Then all this happened Sir..

54
00:06:25,352 --> 00:06:26,393
Sir

55
00:06:28,685 --> 00:06:30,768
After hearing all the arguments

56
00:06:30,768 --> 00:06:33,768
and inspecting
all the evidence

57
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:40,268
It is proven that Accused
Vishnu of CC Number 139/2010

58
00:06:40,268 --> 00:06:47,227
has killed Ram Das inhumanly
near Maruthi Circle

59
00:06:47,227 --> 00:06:52,602
According to Sec 302 the court orders
life term sentence to the accused

60
00:09:40,768 --> 00:09:44,310
Accused Vishnu of Cab Driver
Murder Case

61
00:09:44,352 --> 00:09:46,435
is getting parole

62
00:09:46,518 --> 00:09:49,227
Tomorrow there's an interview
for hiring lawyers in your firm

63
00:09:49,227 --> 00:09:52,477
Whoever is appointed
will get that case.

64
00:09:52,477 --> 00:09:54,185
You know that right?

65
00:09:54,268 --> 00:09:56,852
First, let's see who
gets appointed

66
00:09:57,018 --> 00:09:59,518
Then we'll decide,
OK?

67
00:10:05,352 --> 00:10:07,310
Good Morning everyone,

68
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:09,935
Welcome to Hegde Associates

69
00:10:10,352 --> 00:10:14,102
All of you are here to
join our legal firm.

70
00:10:16,018 --> 00:10:20,018
but there's good news
and bad news

71
00:10:21,018 --> 00:10:22,768
The good news is

72
00:10:22,768 --> 00:10:26,602
one of you will
surely get the Job

73
00:10:27,143 --> 00:10:29,227
And the bad news is

74
00:10:29,227 --> 00:10:32,060
only one individual
will get that job

75
00:10:34,227 --> 00:10:37,727
I have an orange in my hand,
I'll give this to you

76
00:10:37,977 --> 00:10:40,227
You should pass it to the
person sitting next to you

77
00:10:40,227 --> 00:10:41,185
But

78
00:10:41,227 --> 00:10:45,018
I want to see, how you
pass it as a lawyer

79
00:10:46,227 --> 00:10:49,060
Let me see how you'll
give it as a lawyer

80
00:10:50,393 --> 00:10:55,102
I'm passing this fruit
which is in my control to you.

81
00:10:55,143 --> 00:10:56,727
According to me

82
00:10:56,768 --> 00:10:57,352
Sorry.

83
00:10:57,352 --> 00:10:59,393
You shouldn't brag about giving

84
00:10:59,393 --> 00:11:00,685
I have already passed it sir

85
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:02,977
I need

86
00:11:03,018 --> 00:11:05,352
Basic advantage is that
it's good for the skin.

87
00:11:05,435 --> 00:11:07,518
I have a lot of problems
at home

88
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,685
Before passing it to the next
person, I'll take a photo of it

89
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:13,560
Bigger advantage is that it
is good for cancer treatment

90
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,977
Give me 2 minutes

91
00:11:15,018 --> 00:11:17,727
I'll think and give you
a perfect answer

92
00:11:19,143 --> 00:11:21,810
You can prepare juice with
it and cook a dish with the peel

93
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:24,435
According to IPC Sec 171E

94
00:11:24,477 --> 00:11:27,352
Give me 5 minutes sir.
I'll answer

95
00:11:27,352 --> 00:11:29,393
My Mom is admitted
in hospital Sir

96
00:11:29,393 --> 00:11:31,352
If someone gives me something

97
00:11:31,352 --> 00:11:33,352
without any reason,
I'll prove it to be a bribe

98
00:11:34,643 --> 00:11:38,018
First, I want a declaration why
you gave this fruit to me

99
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:40,727
This orange, Your co-workers...

100
00:11:40,768 --> 00:11:42,852
Then I'll pass it to next person

101
00:11:42,893 --> 00:11:45,102
after I get a
declaration from them

102
00:11:45,143 --> 00:11:48,185
I want a Bond paper and...

103
00:11:57,018 --> 00:12:01,768
What I intend to notify the
people present here is...

104
00:12:01,768 --> 00:12:05,518
This fruit is my interest and property

105
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,727
Me having the complete rights
of its peel, pulp, juice, seed

106
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:11,810
to drink, eat or use it as I wish.

107
00:12:11,893 --> 00:12:15,393
Would like to pass this fruit with or
without the Peel, pulp, juice, seed

108
00:12:15,393 --> 00:12:19,893
To the person sitting next
to me, to use it anytime

109
00:12:19,893 --> 00:12:25,060
anywhere, for any need with
my complete permission

110
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:37,435
Ok, lets move to
the second round

111
00:12:37,435 --> 00:12:41,727
An MLA takes funds from the Govt
stating he'll construct 10 Buildings

112
00:12:41,768 --> 00:12:44,060
Later he constructs only 1 Building

113
00:12:44,102 --> 00:12:47,310
Then he blackmails the site
engineer who visited the location

114
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:50,393
And gets the NOC, stating 10
buildings are constructed

115
00:12:50,435 --> 00:12:54,477
But, there is no proof that he
has blackmailed the site engineer.

116
00:12:54,477 --> 00:12:55,977
After 5 Years

117
00:12:56,018 --> 00:12:58,935
A PIL is registered against
the site engineer

118
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:01,935
Now that site
engineer is my client

119
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,435
what sort of
case can we register

120
00:13:05,435 --> 00:13:07,893
So that the MLA is punished

121
00:13:07,935 --> 00:13:10,268
and the site engineer
is not punished

122
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:11,435
Very simple Sir

123
00:13:11,477 --> 00:13:14,102
We should file a case asking
him to show the 10 Buildings

124
00:13:14,143 --> 00:13:17,268
We should treat the construction
workers as evidence

125
00:13:17,268 --> 00:13:21,227
We should contact the
cement and sand suppliers

126
00:13:21,227 --> 00:13:25,018
Sir we request for raw material
bills and send it for audit

127
00:13:25,227 --> 00:13:28,935
Sir let's calculate the time necessary
for construction of 10 Buildings

128
00:13:28,935 --> 00:13:32,102
and compare it with the time they took
for construction and then prove it

129
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:34,685
Sir, we can treat the
neighbours as witnesses

130
00:13:34,727 --> 00:13:36,893
If we do this,

131
00:13:36,935 --> 00:13:39,685
our client
will also be punished.

132
00:13:39,727 --> 00:13:42,268
He threatened me
to sign the NOC

133
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:45,560
What if we make the site
engineer to speak the truth?

134
00:13:45,602 --> 00:13:48,435
Sir, with all the call records
of MLA & site engineer

135
00:13:48,477 --> 00:13:51,185
we can prove that he has
threatened our client

136
00:13:51,893 --> 00:13:55,143
Sir let's file a case stating MLA
had constructed all 10 Buildings

137
00:13:55,185 --> 00:13:56,102
But..

138
00:13:56,102 --> 00:13:58,935
Within 3 Months of construction,
due to poor quality

139
00:13:58,977 --> 00:14:01,227
the buildings have collapsed.

140
00:14:01,393 --> 00:14:02,643
Why?

141
00:14:02,685 --> 00:14:03,560
Now

142
00:14:03,602 --> 00:14:05,643
The MLA has to give the money

143
00:14:05,685 --> 00:14:07,602
even if he
agrees or disagrees

144
00:14:07,602 --> 00:14:11,018
for the construction
of the building

145
00:14:11,102 --> 00:14:12,560
What's your name?

146
00:14:14,727 --> 00:14:17,227
Sir actually,
he's my fiancÃ©

147
00:14:17,227 --> 00:14:19,227
Really!?
You never told me!

148
00:14:19,268 --> 00:14:21,643
You better take care.He's too good.

149
00:14:21,685 --> 00:14:24,310
Now Both of you work,
in the same office

150
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:28,060
Sir, he is intelligent
but not mature enough

151
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:33,518
Boys & wine
take time to mature.

152
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,560
Hello Sir

153
00:14:35,685 --> 00:14:39,102
Mister?
- Mahesh Das

154
00:14:39,102 --> 00:14:41,852
Your way of thinking was too good.
- Thank you so much

155
00:14:41,893 --> 00:14:43,685
I'm quite impressed
- Thank you Sir..

156
00:14:43,893 --> 00:14:46,893
Actually, We have thought of
giving him a new case right?

157
00:14:46,893 --> 00:14:51,393
Our firm is thinking of
starting a free legal service

158
00:14:51,393 --> 00:14:52,185
OK..

159
00:14:52,185 --> 00:14:56,268
So that it helps the poor
and backward class people

160
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,227
I'll give you the details
of it, Shastri..

161
00:14:59,893 --> 00:15:01,185
Shastri..

162
00:15:02,352 --> 00:15:03,727
Yes Sir

163
00:15:04,893 --> 00:15:06,685
What is it sir ?

164
00:15:06,768 --> 00:15:08,727
Shastri, He is Mahesh

165
00:15:09,435 --> 00:15:11,143
Give him the details of..

166
00:15:11,185 --> 00:15:13,393
That family Case sir?
- Yes.

167
00:15:13,477 --> 00:15:16,435
Let him study and go through it..

168
00:15:16,477 --> 00:15:19,268
You take that file &
meet the family tomorrow

169
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:21,768
Sure sir..
- Then you let me know.

170
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:22,560
Sure

171
00:15:22,602 --> 00:15:25,143
Welcome to Hegde &

00:15:25,185 --> 00:15:26,852

00:15:34,727 --> 00:15:38,393
Office! - You said that you'll
talk to your Dad, if I get the case

175
00:15:38,435 --> 00:15:41,352
Now that I got the case

176
00:15:41,393 --> 00:15:43,810
After you get a big case

177
00:15:52,477 --> 00:15:54,935
What is happening here?
- what is it Sir?

178
00:15:54,977 --> 00:15:57,435
I am asking about the thing
that happened here now.

179
00:15:58,102 --> 00:16:00,393
How can you lie so easily
- Lie!

180
00:16:00,435 --> 00:16:02,477
Is this an office?
- Yes Sir!

181
00:16:02,477 --> 00:16:05,310
Oh Shit.
Is this a park?

182
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:07,268
No sir,
- this is an office !

183
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:09,518
I won't tolerate it, if I
see such behaviour. Ok?

184
00:16:09,518 --> 00:16:10,768
OK Sir..

185
00:16:10,768 --> 00:16:13,477
I don't like it.
I'm very strict.

186
00:16:13,477 --> 00:16:15,643
Take the file.
- Thank you Sir

187
00:16:15,685 --> 00:16:18,060
Don't make me angry.
Follow me.

188
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,768
He's confusing me

189
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:24,102
Shastri, after the build up
you gave me yesterday

190
00:16:24,102 --> 00:16:26,852
I thought you were my senior. Now
I know that you are my junior.

191
00:16:26,893 --> 00:16:28,268
How was my build up Sir?

192
00:16:28,268 --> 00:16:31,685
Stop. this is the
place, that's the home

193
00:16:35,602 --> 00:16:37,727
Oh shit!

194
00:16:39,727 --> 00:16:42,518
Sir, my mobile screen is shattered
- Shattered?

195
00:16:42,852 --> 00:16:44,685
Its a bad omen,

196
00:16:44,727 --> 00:16:46,727
We'll surely lose the case..

197
00:16:46,768 --> 00:16:50,852
Sir, do you believe
in such things?

198
00:16:50,935 --> 00:16:53,435
Sir, I'm here for your luck

199
00:16:53,477 --> 00:16:56,435
Shastri, you don't
know about my luck yet.

200
00:16:56,435 --> 00:16:59,435
I'm a very lucky guy in
unlucky circumstances

201
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,435
Sir...

202
00:17:01,518 --> 00:17:04,393
if it's lucky to see a fox's face,
does anybody pet a fox?

203
00:17:04,393 --> 00:17:06,602
No, but they pet a cat right?
What do you say Madam?

204
00:17:06,602 --> 00:17:08,060
Shastri..

205
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:11,185
to better my luck,
if I pet a Fox.

206
00:17:11,185 --> 00:17:13,685
At the end it say meow Like a cat

207
00:17:13,685 --> 00:17:15,393
Madam, he's very funny

208
00:17:15,393 --> 00:17:17,435
Have you finished?

209
00:17:17,435 --> 00:17:19,185
Can we meet the
client now please?

210
00:17:19,227 --> 00:17:21,352
Why are you wasting time? Go check

211
00:17:21,352 --> 00:17:23,977
OK Sir, order me on
everything

212
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:26,518
Who is it?
- Madam Sumithramma

213
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,810
I am Sumithramma,
Who are you guys?

214
00:17:28,852 --> 00:17:33,602
They said it's for sale,
How much for an acre?

215
00:17:34,268 --> 00:17:36,977
Madam, We are lawyers.
From Bengaluru.

216
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:39,893
Oh, I was the one who
wrote the letter

217
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:42,727
Welcome. Come inside.

218
00:17:43,227 --> 00:17:44,268
Idiot.

219
00:17:45,393 --> 00:17:47,352
Please come and sit down

220
00:17:50,185 --> 00:17:52,602
Sir the house looks good.

221
00:17:53,352 --> 00:17:55,852
If it's cheap make a deal.

222
00:17:55,852 --> 00:17:57,518
Don't talk, keep quiet!

223
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,893
House is filled with stars

224
00:18:00,893 --> 00:18:03,727
Take it
- Drawings are so nice

225
00:18:03,768 --> 00:18:06,685
My son drew them.
Sit down.

226
00:18:06,685 --> 00:18:10,310
Will you guys drink
coffee or tea?

227
00:18:10,602 --> 00:18:12,310
Anything Madam

228
00:18:12,352 --> 00:18:13,935
Ok, I'll bring Coffee

229
00:18:17,477 --> 00:18:19,060
What are you doing?

230
00:18:19,268 --> 00:18:21,685
She asked me
and I said anything is OK

231
00:18:21,727 --> 00:18:23,102
For that...

232
00:18:36,143 --> 00:18:37,477
What do you want?

233
00:18:38,268 --> 00:18:40,893
We are lawyers
from Bengaluru

234
00:18:40,893 --> 00:18:42,185
about the court case...

235
00:18:42,185 --> 00:18:44,435
There is no case here,
you guys can go..

236
00:18:49,685 --> 00:18:52,060
Sir, please listen to
what he has to say

237
00:18:52,102 --> 00:18:53,435
You don't have to say anything

238
00:18:53,477 --> 00:18:55,352
Didn't I say go out!

239
00:18:55,352 --> 00:18:57,935
Sir, Sumithramma...
- I'm saying get out

240
00:18:58,227 --> 00:19:00,685
We don't want your help,
please go..

241
00:19:00,685 --> 00:19:01,935
Vishnu, stop it..

242
00:19:01,977 --> 00:19:03,893
How can you say..
- will you guys go or not?

243
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:06,435
Vishnu,
what is wrong with you?

244
00:19:06,435 --> 00:19:07,810
Sir, one minute..

245
00:19:07,935 --> 00:19:09,810
Mom, be quiet.
you don't understand

246
00:19:09,893 --> 00:19:12,435
You are wasting money, paying
such people again and again

247
00:19:12,435 --> 00:19:14,560
Why are you looking
at my face? Get out!

248
00:19:14,602 --> 00:19:16,685
Vishnu shut up,
where are your manners?

249
00:19:16,685 --> 00:19:18,227
enough of this
Vishnu, go out now

250
00:19:18,393 --> 00:19:19,518
Go now!

251
00:19:19,518 --> 00:19:20,977
Do as you wish

252
00:19:21,143 --> 00:19:22,227
Vishnu,go

253
00:19:23,352 --> 00:19:24,810
Please sit down.

254
00:19:25,185 --> 00:19:26,143
Sorry.

255
00:19:26,185 --> 00:19:28,102
Please don't feel bad.

256
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:33,602
My son is a very good kid.

257
00:19:33,602 --> 00:19:35,185
He was not like this earlier.

258
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:40,102
Many lawyers have cheated us after
taking money for this case

259
00:19:40,268 --> 00:19:41,268
That's the reason.

260
00:19:41,393 --> 00:19:44,935
He neither believes nor respects
any lawyers.

261
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,768
It's ok Madam..

262
00:19:48,102 --> 00:19:50,477
For a guy who's seen
only bad things in life

263
00:19:50,602 --> 00:19:53,352
Sees bad in good things

264
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:56,852
If you don't mind

265
00:19:58,602 --> 00:20:02,477
can you please explain
this case to me?

266
00:20:24,852 --> 00:20:27,143
Can I talk to him once?
- Yes

267
00:20:44,935 --> 00:20:45,977
Look

268
00:20:46,602 --> 00:20:49,560
Every person we meet in our life

269
00:20:49,727 --> 00:20:51,727
would have loved some things

270
00:20:51,768 --> 00:20:53,727
lost some things

271
00:20:53,768 --> 00:20:56,435
and feared some things

272
00:20:57,227 --> 00:21:00,143
If you want a wound to heal

273
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,227
first, you should stop
touching it

274
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:05,393
anyways

275
00:21:05,435 --> 00:21:06,935
I'll come to the point

276
00:21:06,977 --> 00:21:08,518
about this case

277
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:12,352
This is a "Right to Indemnity case"

278
00:21:12,393 --> 00:21:14,268
In simple terms,

279
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:16,143
"Compensation case"

280
00:21:16,185 --> 00:21:18,560
You should give

281
00:21:18,727 --> 00:21:20,810
7 Lakh to the cab
driver's family.

282
00:21:21,268 --> 00:21:24,310
We can get you more time stating

283
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:27,477
Your financial status
is poor.

284
00:21:28,185 --> 00:21:30,560
If you don't
give that money..

285
00:21:31,643 --> 00:21:33,268
Your term in jail

286
00:21:33,435 --> 00:21:34,560
might increase

287
00:21:34,935 --> 00:21:37,185
Anyways, I'll try my level best.

288
00:21:37,268 --> 00:21:38,268
But...

289
00:21:40,477 --> 00:21:42,310
Being just 20 years old

290
00:21:44,227 --> 00:21:46,727
What was the reason to
kill that cab driver?

291
00:21:50,727 --> 00:21:53,643
It's OK, if you don't
like to talk about it

292
00:21:53,768 --> 00:21:56,893
I was just enquiring, so
it might help me with the case

293
00:21:57,102 --> 00:21:58,102
anyways

294
00:21:59,268 --> 00:22:00,477
Don't lose hope.

295
00:22:00,727 --> 00:22:03,685
I'm here for you,
I'll do my level best.

296
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:10,185
Good things happen
to good people

297
00:22:10,518 --> 00:22:12,560
Bad things happen
to bad people

298
00:22:12,852 --> 00:22:14,893
If I ever meet the guy
who said these words

299
00:22:14,893 --> 00:22:16,852
I'll kick the hell out of him

300
00:22:17,935 --> 00:22:21,018
Everything,
I said till now was the truth

301
00:22:22,393 --> 00:22:24,893
But no one believed it

302
00:22:25,893 --> 00:22:28,477
But if you believe it...

303
00:22:30,852 --> 00:22:32,393
That is the truth.

304
00:22:42,185 --> 00:22:45,227
Mom, there was lot of work,
That's why the delay

305
00:22:45,268 --> 00:22:47,810
You Don't worry,
I'll reach home now.

306
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,393
Go to sleep Mom..

307
00:22:49,435 --> 00:22:51,685
Mom I'll reach home soon.

308
00:22:51,727 --> 00:22:53,018
The work load was high.

309
00:22:53,352 --> 00:22:55,768
Mom did you take your pills?

310
00:23:16,477 --> 00:23:19,018
Sir I work in a Bar nearby

311
00:23:19,018 --> 00:23:21,018
While I was going home

312
00:23:21,018 --> 00:23:23,435
A bike came opposite me,
I Skidded and fell down

313
00:23:23,477 --> 00:23:25,393
Sir, thephone is switched off

314
00:23:29,477 --> 00:23:31,518
Sir, What do we do now?

315
00:23:34,852 --> 00:23:36,268
Let's see..

316
00:23:37,143 --> 00:23:38,935
Come with me.
- Yes Sir.

317
00:23:42,727 --> 00:23:43,935
Hello Sir.

318
00:23:44,435 --> 00:23:46,143
Did you inform us
about the incident?

319
00:23:46,143 --> 00:23:47,852
Yes Sir.

320
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,477
What were you doing
here, so late?

321
00:23:53,518 --> 00:23:55,768
I was going home after
work in the bar.

322
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:57,518
Then all this happened Sir.

323
00:24:12,685 --> 00:24:14,185
Come on speak.

324
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,185
Tell me.

325
00:24:16,227 --> 00:24:18,685
You said someone
passed this way on a bike

326
00:24:20,935 --> 00:24:21,935
Who is he?

327
00:24:21,977 --> 00:24:23,227
How does he look?

328
00:24:24,518 --> 00:24:26,893
He was wearing a helmet sir.

329
00:24:26,977 --> 00:24:29,352
Tell me the truth.

330
00:24:29,393 --> 00:24:31,935
Was he wearing a helmet?

331
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:34,310
His face was not visible sir.

332
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,685
How could you not see him.

333
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,352
Guru..

334
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:39,768
Sir..

335
00:24:40,935 --> 00:24:42,352
Murthy?
- Sir.

336
00:24:42,477 --> 00:24:45,560
Did he say anything?
- He's repeating the same thing Sir.

337
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:48,518
Once he says, I saw the face..

338
00:24:48,518 --> 00:24:50,935
Now he says he
was wearing a helmet

339
00:25:00,768 --> 00:25:02,935
Listen to me..

340
00:25:03,018 --> 00:25:04,518
Firstly,

341
00:25:04,518 --> 00:25:06,477
Tell us a lie
that's believable

342
00:25:06,518 --> 00:25:07,310
else...

343
00:25:07,352 --> 00:25:10,477
Accept the truth & confess
that you are the culprit.

344
00:25:10,977 --> 00:25:12,685
You failed in both of them.

345
00:25:12,893 --> 00:25:15,518
Murthy, note this down.

346
00:25:17,185 --> 00:25:20,060
Accused Vishnu

347
00:25:21,227 --> 00:25:24,143
Approximately between
12 to 12:15 AM.

348
00:25:24,935 --> 00:25:27,602
while driving too fast

349
00:25:27,643 --> 00:25:32,268
crashed into to a cab after
losing control of the bike

350
00:25:32,602 --> 00:25:35,768
later following the cab

351
00:25:36,227 --> 00:25:40,352
He stopped the cab near
Maruthi circle signal..

352
00:25:41,143 --> 00:25:42,143
Sir..

353
00:25:42,185 --> 00:25:45,643
Then an argument took place
Between the cab driver & Vishnu

354
00:25:45,768 --> 00:25:47,602
After a heated argument

355
00:25:47,643 --> 00:25:49,810
Vishnu killed the cab driver

356
00:25:49,852 --> 00:25:52,143
with the Knife,
which was in his bike.

357
00:25:52,185 --> 00:25:54,685
Sir, this is perfect.
- Sir...

358
00:25:54,727 --> 00:25:57,060
Sir Please Sir, I'm
not the culprit Sir.

359
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:59,435
Sir I'm innocent,
please let me go.

360
00:25:59,477 --> 00:26:00,352
Sir..

361
00:26:00,393 --> 00:26:02,768
Is everything ok Murthy?
- Sir everything's alright.

362
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:04,977
But, there's a minor problem..

363
00:26:05,018 --> 00:26:07,852
I feel the knife we
seized is a bit small.

364
00:26:08,185 --> 00:26:09,227
OK.

365
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:11,560
The cuts on the
body were a bit wide

366
00:26:11,893 --> 00:26:15,018
I'm thinking whether this
knife matches with that?

367
00:26:17,518 --> 00:26:18,518
Sir..

368
00:26:18,893 --> 00:26:20,227
We found the murder weapon..

369
00:26:20,643 --> 00:26:22,352
It was in the bar,
where he works.

370
00:26:22,352 --> 00:26:23,893
Both have the same fingerprints

371
00:26:32,185 --> 00:26:33,310
Murthy?

372
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:36,518
Ok, Perfect Sir..

373
00:26:38,727 --> 00:26:40,935
What do you have to say now?
- Sir!

374
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:44,602
Sir please let me go sir,
My life will be ruined

375
00:26:44,643 --> 00:26:46,768
Please let me go Sir...

376
00:26:46,852 --> 00:26:49,018
Sir, do you think
he'll confess?

377
00:26:49,018 --> 00:26:50,477
Murthy..

378
00:26:51,102 --> 00:26:53,435
Few people agree for words

379
00:26:54,102 --> 00:26:55,727
But wounds..

380
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:58,310
Wounds make everyone agree

381
00:27:09,602 --> 00:27:11,268
So, after all this.

382
00:27:11,393 --> 00:27:13,143
They produced Vishnu in the court

383
00:27:13,477 --> 00:27:14,560
Famous lawyer..

384
00:27:14,685 --> 00:27:16,435
And your ex-boss

385
00:27:16,477 --> 00:27:17,893
Parthasarathy

386
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:20,393
is a close friend of
the Inspector

387
00:27:20,727 --> 00:27:22,435
He handled the case

388
00:27:22,643 --> 00:27:23,602
and

389
00:27:23,643 --> 00:27:26,477
he Proves in the court that
Vishnu is the Murderer

390
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:29,435
So according to the court

391
00:27:29,643 --> 00:27:31,393
Under Sec 302.

392
00:27:31,435 --> 00:27:35,102
Culprit Vishnu is sentenced
for life term in jail.

393
00:27:36,518 --> 00:27:37,727
So this is the matter.

394
00:27:37,768 --> 00:27:40,268
Shastri, keep the files aside.

395
00:27:40,477 --> 00:27:42,102
As we did not eat
anything since morning.

396
00:27:42,143 --> 00:27:43,477
I'm very hungry

397
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,977
Tell me, what will you eat?

398
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:47,852
Sir, Veg Biryani
with ample Vegetables

399
00:27:47,935 --> 00:27:50,227
And to digest that,
I'll have one Coke.

400
00:27:50,268 --> 00:27:51,977
That's it
- Ok, what about you?

401
00:27:51,977 --> 00:27:54,435
You always keep
thinking about eating

402
00:27:54,768 --> 00:27:56,227
What about diet, gym?

403
00:27:56,477 --> 00:27:57,768
and weight loss?

404
00:27:57,768 --> 00:27:59,018
Nothing about it...

405
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:00,268
Actually..

406
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:02,727
Even I'm thinking about
losing weight Jaanu

407
00:28:02,768 --> 00:28:06,102
But, as you already know.
I hate losing

408
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:08,560
Be it court case or body weight?

409
00:28:08,643 --> 00:28:10,685
Dude! what a dialogue..

410
00:28:10,727 --> 00:28:13,518
You speak very good dialogues
- Thank you Shastri..

411
00:28:14,518 --> 00:28:16,352
Dude!?

412
00:28:21,685 --> 00:28:22,935
Yes, Dude..

413
00:28:24,602 --> 00:28:28,685
Oh, I think Madam doesnâ€™t
know why I say Dude?

414
00:28:28,727 --> 00:28:30,227
It's ok, I'll explain.

415
00:28:31,393 --> 00:28:32,602
Close friends...

416
00:28:33,352 --> 00:28:34,685
They meet every morning...

417
00:28:34,893 --> 00:28:38,268
Do you say, Hey buddy,
Had Your breakfast?

418
00:28:38,435 --> 00:28:39,685
No.

419
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:44,643
Words like Dude, Nigga,
Arsehole comes very easily

420
00:28:44,768 --> 00:28:47,060
Because that's friendship.

421
00:28:47,102 --> 00:28:49,268
And friendship is great
- Yes, Yes..

422
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,602
Sir
- Yes...

423
00:28:50,602 --> 00:28:51,977
This is the last time.

424
00:28:52,018 --> 00:28:54,435
From tomorrow, I'll
call you Dude.

425
00:28:54,477 --> 00:28:57,268
Do you have any objection?
- No objections Shastri..

426
00:28:57,268 --> 00:28:59,018
Not Shastri..

427
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,893
Dude, Dude..

428
00:29:00,893 --> 00:29:02,685
Have you finished?
Very funny.

429
00:29:02,685 --> 00:29:05,602
If you have anything
else, please continue..

430
00:29:05,768 --> 00:29:07,560
Do you have anything to add?

431
00:29:07,643 --> 00:29:09,018
Nothing else Madam

432
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:11,060
So now can we talk
about this case?

433
00:29:11,143 --> 00:29:12,060
Thank you.

434
00:29:12,102 --> 00:29:14,643
What did that guy say,
when you talked to him?

435
00:29:14,643 --> 00:29:16,268
Can we take this case?

436
00:29:16,393 --> 00:29:17,685
Yes, I talked to him.

437
00:29:17,727 --> 00:29:20,518
I think he was framed,
and I feel he's innocent

438
00:29:20,727 --> 00:29:23,935
Actually he was saying, he
did not kill the cab driver

439
00:29:23,977 --> 00:29:25,893
But the guy was punished.

440
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:28,643
Yes, and now
he's out on parole

441
00:29:28,977 --> 00:29:32,060
Sir, I think if we fight for the
guy who's already sentenced

442
00:29:32,102 --> 00:29:33,685
its pointless, there's no use.

443
00:29:33,685 --> 00:29:35,310
Shastri, the thing is...

444
00:29:35,352 --> 00:29:38,518
Now if we take this
Right to Indemnity case

445
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,018
What can we do?

446
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:42,518
We can't make the court waive
off the compensation amount

447
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:45,852
The max we can do is, get him
more time to pay the money

448
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:49,352
Now, he has already finished
his term in the jail.

449
00:29:49,602 --> 00:29:51,227
Though he has not
committed the murder

450
00:29:51,268 --> 00:29:53,227
And now paying the compensation

451
00:29:53,227 --> 00:29:55,602
is not the right thing
- Yes sir..

452
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:58,227
Boss is enquiring repeatedly

453
00:29:58,227 --> 00:30:00,060
for the updates on the case

454
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:02,643
Yeah, I was thinking
about that in the car..

455
00:30:02,685 --> 00:30:04,685
We'll plan that tomorrow...

456
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:06,602
Sir any information about that?
- your orders

457
00:30:06,643 --> 00:30:08,435
Keep it here.

458
00:30:13,268 --> 00:30:15,268
Anything else
- Do you want anything?

459
00:30:15,268 --> 00:30:17,518
No, What about you?

460
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:19,477
Idiot!!

461
00:30:19,518 --> 00:30:21,560
You ruined my pant!

462
00:30:22,143 --> 00:30:23,852
Sorry sir,
I'll bring a new one.

463
00:30:23,893 --> 00:30:25,643
Hey wait..

464
00:30:25,643 --> 00:30:27,310
Repeat what you said..

465
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:28,977
You idiot..
- Not you.

466
00:30:29,185 --> 00:30:31,560
What did you say?
- I said, I'll bring a new one

467
00:30:31,852 --> 00:30:32,893
New one!?

468
00:30:39,852 --> 00:30:41,143
So on that day,

469
00:30:41,185 --> 00:30:44,435
Our guy was riding, while talking
to his mother on the phone

470
00:30:44,435 --> 00:30:46,227
A bike comes opposite him

471
00:30:46,227 --> 00:30:47,768
He skidded and fell down

472
00:30:47,852 --> 00:30:48,852
Later

473
00:30:48,893 --> 00:30:51,310
He himself informs the
police about the murder.

474
00:30:51,352 --> 00:30:52,227
But..

475
00:30:52,227 --> 00:30:54,060
The police who came
to investigate,

476
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:56,435
frames him as the murderer

477
00:30:56,685 --> 00:30:58,060
Ok but..

478
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:00,143
Why would the police frame him

479
00:31:00,185 --> 00:31:02,602
As the murderer, in a normal
cab driver murder case?

480
00:31:02,685 --> 00:31:03,977
Point lies there.

481
00:31:04,018 --> 00:31:06,477
That cab driver was not
just a normal cab driver

482
00:31:06,477 --> 00:31:08,477
He was also a police informer

483
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,727
So that's the reason, I=='m telling you.

484
00:31:11,727 --> 00:31:14,102
The boy has been framed

485
00:31:14,227 --> 00:31:16,393
Sir, how about this?

486
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:19,143
What if he's the culprit?

487
00:31:19,268 --> 00:31:21,352
To avoid paying
the compensation.

488
00:31:21,393 --> 00:31:22,852
he might have made a plan

489
00:31:22,893 --> 00:31:25,352
of re-opening the case
so that it is re-investigated

490
00:31:25,393 --> 00:31:27,268
My point is,
it might be planned

491
00:31:27,268 --> 00:31:29,560
Sir, He's just a bar Supplier.

492
00:31:29,602 --> 00:31:32,268
Not a criminal
Lawyer like you

493
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:33,935
So...

494
00:31:34,477 --> 00:31:36,143
What should we do?

495
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:38,185
Sir, according to me

496
00:31:38,185 --> 00:31:41,185
rather than fighting
this compensation case

497
00:31:41,477 --> 00:31:43,060
let's open the real case.

498
00:31:43,102 --> 00:31:45,602
Stating that the guy did
not kill the driver.

499
00:31:45,727 --> 00:31:48,810
Then this compensation
case will be nullified

500
00:31:49,227 --> 00:31:50,227
Look..

501
00:31:51,602 --> 00:31:53,643
the court has to accept this

502
00:31:54,852 --> 00:31:57,893
All the proof and evidence
should be re-examined

503
00:31:57,977 --> 00:31:59,518
and reinvestigated.

504
00:31:59,518 --> 00:32:02,310
More than that there will
be lot of expenses

505
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,727
and that's how the court works

506
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:09,518
As it is an old case, it
involves lot of money

507
00:32:10,102 --> 00:32:11,477
We have to juggle a lot

508
00:32:12,018 --> 00:32:13,435
and its not a joke.

509
00:32:13,768 --> 00:32:16,060
Think about it.
- Sir, if you don't mind.

510
00:32:16,102 --> 00:32:18,477
Why did you start this
free legal service?

511
00:32:18,518 --> 00:32:20,852
To help honest people

512
00:32:20,893 --> 00:32:21,727
Sir...

513
00:32:21,727 --> 00:32:25,602
We are in a time where people stamp their
names on a fan donated to a temple.

514
00:32:25,643 --> 00:32:27,768
Nobody does anything for free

515
00:32:27,768 --> 00:32:30,018
Let's accept it.
It's for branding.

516
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:32,018
If our company fights such
cases,

517
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,310
people will trust us.

518
00:32:33,352 --> 00:32:35,852
Thus an increase in the
client base.

519
00:32:35,935 --> 00:32:37,768
Sir, think about this
for a minute.

520
00:32:37,768 --> 00:32:39,185
If we take up this case

521
00:32:39,185 --> 00:32:41,393
Questioning the sentence
of an innocent guy...

522
00:32:41,393 --> 00:32:45,102
The amount of media attention
and publicity we will get.

523
00:32:48,185 --> 00:32:49,893
After all this...

524
00:32:51,143 --> 00:32:52,810
What if he's the murderer

525
00:32:52,852 --> 00:32:54,435
Sir, it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t make
any difference

526
00:32:54,435 --> 00:32:57,393
Because he has already
finished his jail term.

527
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:06,310
OK.

528
00:33:06,768 --> 00:33:08,435
Let's fight this case.

529
00:33:08,518 --> 00:33:10,185
Thanks a lot Sir.

530
00:33:21,643 --> 00:33:23,352
Call your Dad...

531
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:47,977
What's your problem?

532
00:33:48,018 --> 00:33:49,768
You guys are like
North and South pole

533
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:52,185
How did love bloom?

534
00:33:52,227 --> 00:33:54,560
Come, I'll explain it to you.

535
00:34:00,268 --> 00:34:01,935
Fantastic dude

536
00:34:01,977 --> 00:34:04,810
Tell us how your
love story started

537
00:34:05,352 --> 00:34:07,352
Even I'm thinking about it.

538
00:34:07,768 --> 00:34:10,560
I was slowly going
behind Ragini Madam

539
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,185
enquiring about a doubt

540
00:34:13,227 --> 00:34:16,018
It was like winning a lottery

541
00:34:16,018 --> 00:34:18,477
As she called me,
to the staff room.

542
00:34:18,477 --> 00:34:20,477
In the midst of this

543
00:34:20,477 --> 00:34:22,893
I saw a drama scene from Ramayana

544
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:25,518
I went in slow motion,

545
00:34:25,518 --> 00:34:29,185
Just when, Sita made her entry.

546
00:34:29,185 --> 00:34:32,977
She is my Nominee Janavi

547
00:34:32,977 --> 00:34:37,227
Day and night,
she haunts me like a fairy.

548
00:34:40,018 --> 00:34:44,060
She is my Nominee Janavi

549
00:34:44,102 --> 00:34:50,018
Day and night,
she haunts me like a fairy.

550
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:53,102
Give me way...

551
00:34:53,143 --> 00:34:56,060
They are chasing Me!...

552
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:58,268
Who is she Dude?

553
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:01,018
Get details about them

554
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:05,310
Put it in the notice board
that she's my love

555
00:35:06,268 --> 00:35:09,393
What will I do, if she
already has a boyfriend?

556
00:35:09,393 --> 00:35:11,268
Don't say such
inauspicious things

557
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:14,143
What if she has Kuja Dosha?

558
00:35:14,185 --> 00:35:16,810
I'll arrange some Homas & Havanas

559
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:19,643
What if her dad is a Don?

560
00:35:19,643 --> 00:35:22,060
I will study law,
and get bail for him.

561
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:24,685
What if he is an encounter specialist?

562
00:35:24,727 --> 00:35:28,310
I'll become the CM at
once and transfer him.

563
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:32,435
In detail say what
happened next, don't pause

564
00:35:32,477 --> 00:35:34,227
In the next scene...

565
00:35:34,268 --> 00:35:39,102
I found a diary,
And I opened it fast.

566
00:35:55,185 --> 00:35:56,727
How is it?

567
00:35:56,727 --> 00:35:58,602
Super.

568
00:36:07,143 --> 00:36:09,602
Who's that?
- Even her name is Janavi

569
00:36:09,643 --> 00:36:12,060
Oh Shit!!

570
00:36:15,477 --> 00:36:18,852
No conversations...

571
00:36:18,893 --> 00:36:21,393
Just observation.

572
00:36:21,435 --> 00:36:24,810
I knew she had
feelings for me...

573
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:28,852
I hid from her..

574
00:36:28,852 --> 00:36:31,602
She thought I was absent.

575
00:36:31,893 --> 00:36:34,768
And she was missing me.

576
00:36:36,852 --> 00:36:40,768
She is my Nominee Janavi...

577
00:36:41,143 --> 00:36:44,060
Day and night,
she haunts me like a fairy.

578
00:36:48,268 --> 00:36:51,518
I want to ask her.
Will you marry me?

579
00:36:51,893 --> 00:36:54,685
If you have any ideas.

580
00:36:54,727 --> 00:36:57,852
please give it to me

581
00:36:58,227 --> 00:37:00,935
Take her to Paris and
gift her a ring

582
00:37:00,977 --> 00:37:03,602
Dude, I don't have a
passport as yet,

583
00:37:03,643 --> 00:37:06,227
Why don't you see
videos on YouTube?

584
00:37:06,268 --> 00:37:08,810
I might get rejected
for being a copycat

585
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:11,685
Propose to her by giving an iPhone

586
00:37:11,727 --> 00:37:14,227
For the money,
give me your kidney

587
00:37:14,268 --> 00:37:16,977
Why don't you go
directly to her home?

588
00:37:17,018 --> 00:37:19,727
My in-law might have
a licensed gun.

589
00:37:42,393 --> 00:37:44,560
Hello...

590
00:37:44,685 --> 00:37:46,893
Is this Vishnu?

591
00:37:47,643 --> 00:37:49,393
Who are you?

592
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,935
What I'm going to say now,

593
00:37:51,935 --> 00:37:54,435
is more important
than who I am.

594
00:37:55,477 --> 00:37:58,102
Do you know why your lawyer

595
00:37:58,768 --> 00:38:02,018
is defending your case?

596
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:05,643
You have already finished
your term in the jail

597
00:38:05,643 --> 00:38:08,268
He can't get that back

598
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:10,602
If this case is re-opened,

599
00:38:10,643 --> 00:38:12,768
police investigation
will be started

600
00:38:12,852 --> 00:38:14,893
It does not affect him.

601
00:38:14,893 --> 00:38:17,685
But, do you want to go
through all that again?

602
00:38:21,685 --> 00:38:22,768
Even you know,

603
00:38:22,768 --> 00:38:26,352
Nobody helps the poor
without any intension.

604
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,977
While two royal
families wage war

605
00:38:30,018 --> 00:38:33,310
only poor solders die.

606
00:38:33,685 --> 00:38:36,102
Remember it...

607
00:38:37,268 --> 00:38:41,518
Where is he?
- on his way

608
00:38:42,352 --> 00:38:43,477
Oh! He's here..

609
00:38:43,518 --> 00:38:45,977
Come sit, we were
waiting for you

610
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:53,602
Anything for You?
- No..

611
00:38:55,268 --> 00:38:56,935
All the case details are ready.

612
00:38:56,935 --> 00:38:58,518
Have brought everything?
- Yes.

613
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,310
OK.

614
00:38:59,352 --> 00:39:01,477
We'd been to the
that cab company

615
00:39:01,477 --> 00:39:03,477
This is their company details

616
00:39:03,643 --> 00:39:06,685
And this is your
call record details

617
00:39:06,727 --> 00:39:08,893
Police never submitted
this in court

618
00:39:08,977 --> 00:39:11,227
This is the post-mortem report

619
00:39:11,268 --> 00:39:13,602
None of these were
tampered. And...

620
00:39:13,643 --> 00:39:15,435
Does this new trail,

621
00:39:15,477 --> 00:39:17,768
case re-investigation work?

622
00:39:18,102 --> 00:39:19,852
It will work for sure.

623
00:39:19,893 --> 00:39:22,143
We Lawyers are here for that.

624
00:39:22,185 --> 00:39:24,227
Though I don't have the
money to pay you guys

625
00:39:24,268 --> 00:39:26,810
Why are you re-opening the case?
- Look

626
00:39:27,102 --> 00:39:28,643
An innocent has been punished

627
00:39:28,685 --> 00:39:30,727
If we get him justice, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll
get a good reputation

628
00:39:30,768 --> 00:39:32,018
You'll get the justice.

629
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:33,727
What is it called?
- Barter deal

630
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:36,102
Same as give and take policy

631
00:39:36,143 --> 00:39:38,435
So, I have served 8 years in jail.

632
00:39:38,477 --> 00:39:40,727
Will your Dad get that back?

633
00:39:43,852 --> 00:39:47,685
Case, trial, re-opening..

634
00:39:47,685 --> 00:39:50,643
I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want your
case or your trial.

635
00:39:51,102 --> 00:39:52,602
Hello, excuse me

636
00:39:56,935 --> 00:39:59,685
Do you guys know who
this fellow here is?

637
00:40:00,977 --> 00:40:02,352
8 Years ago

638
00:40:02,393 --> 00:40:05,310
A cab driver was murdered
in Maruthi Circle

639
00:40:05,643 --> 00:40:08,143
That murder was committed

640
00:40:10,643 --> 00:40:11,643
by him.

641
00:40:19,352 --> 00:40:22,643
Do you know what all these people
are thinking right now?

642
00:40:22,643 --> 00:40:24,893
Why did they let him
out of jail

643
00:40:24,935 --> 00:40:26,768
rather than hanging him to death.

644
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:29,435
And how many murders
will he commit again

645
00:40:29,477 --> 00:40:31,643
while he is outside.

646
00:40:31,768 --> 00:40:33,852
In this society, not just you,

647
00:40:33,893 --> 00:40:36,560
Your mother is a murderer's mom,

648
00:40:36,602 --> 00:40:40,102
And your future child is
also a murdererÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s child

649
00:40:40,143 --> 00:40:41,352
So,

650
00:40:41,352 --> 00:40:44,935
You are a murderer
today, tomorrow

651
00:40:44,977 --> 00:40:48,518
and you are a murderer
till you die

652
00:40:49,268 --> 00:40:53,060
So, if you want to lose
the title of murderer

653
00:40:58,310 --> 00:41:00,685
you should fight this case.

654
00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:02,060
Lets go.

655
00:41:17,435 --> 00:41:19,477
I feel, I made a huge
mistake taking this case

656
00:41:19,518 --> 00:41:21,935
Why do you get tense?
- Dude, stop it..

657
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,893
Sir...

658
00:41:26,018 --> 00:41:28,393
Sir, please stop.
I'm very sorry.

659
00:41:28,435 --> 00:41:30,643
Please forgive me..
- Just get lost.

660
00:41:30,685 --> 00:41:34,102
Sorry Sir, I misunderstood
you listening to others

661
00:41:34,102 --> 00:41:36,393
Just get lost,
I'm not in the mood for this.

662
00:41:36,393 --> 00:41:38,518
Get lost - Listen to
what he has to say

663
00:41:38,518 --> 00:41:41,560
Sir, I'm poor. I believe
anything people say.

664
00:41:41,602 --> 00:41:42,893
Please forgive me,

665
00:41:42,893 --> 00:41:45,102
Sir let's fight this case again.

666
00:41:45,143 --> 00:41:46,435
Sir I'll do as you say.

667
00:41:46,435 --> 00:41:49,518
Let's re-open, re-investigate,
and do anything that's necessary

668
00:41:49,518 --> 00:41:52,310
I'm sorry Sir

669
00:41:53,102 --> 00:41:54,560
OK.

670
00:41:55,810 --> 00:41:58,893
Never do this again.
- No sir.

671
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:08,977
According to police F.I.R,
our guy crashed into the car.

672
00:42:09,018 --> 00:42:12,560
After having an argument he
followed and stopped the cab

673
00:42:12,852 --> 00:42:14,518
After a heated argument

674
00:42:14,518 --> 00:42:18,602
he murdered the cab driver with
the knife in his bike

675
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:21,643
But, according to call records

676
00:42:21,685 --> 00:42:24,352
our guy was talking
to his mom on the phone

677
00:42:24,352 --> 00:42:27,935
After ending the call within 90
seconds he informed the police

678
00:42:27,977 --> 00:42:30,935
So is there a possibility

679
00:42:30,977 --> 00:42:33,560
of all this happening
in 90 seconds?

680
00:42:50,643 --> 00:42:54,102
Are you ready?

681
00:43:00,102 --> 00:43:02,060
Move

682
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:08,143
You Idiot, do you know how to drive?
- go away

683
00:43:08,185 --> 00:43:10,893
What do you think of
yourself stop the car..

684
00:43:10,935 --> 00:43:13,685
I'll kick you, what do
you think of yourself?

685
00:43:13,727 --> 00:43:15,685
Come outside,

686
00:43:15,685 --> 00:43:17,810
How dare you scold me..
- what can you do?

687
00:43:17,852 --> 00:43:20,143
I'll kill you,
- first come outside.

688
00:43:20,185 --> 00:43:22,018
You bloody son of a b**ch

689
00:43:22,018 --> 00:43:23,977
How dare you talk about
my mom. I'll kill you

690
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:26,268
Let's see who dies first

691
00:43:26,268 --> 00:43:28,810
What do you think of yourself?
You don't know about me?

692
00:43:28,852 --> 00:43:30,727
Come outside,
lets see who dies first

693
00:43:30,768 --> 00:43:35,393
I will kill you now -
how dare you... get down

694
00:43:52,685 --> 00:43:53,685
Sir..

695
00:43:54,768 --> 00:43:56,685
How long is it?

696
00:44:13,352 --> 00:44:14,435
Yes.

697
00:44:18,352 --> 00:44:20,477
This has the cab company details

698
00:44:20,810 --> 00:44:26,227
This includes the data of the
cab's whereabouts

699
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:27,393
OK..

700
00:44:27,435 --> 00:44:29,602
And this is

701
00:44:29,727 --> 00:44:31,602
call record details of our client.

702
00:44:31,893 --> 00:44:34,143
Police never submitted
this to the court.

703
00:44:34,185 --> 00:44:35,977
And this is a major evidence.

704
00:44:36,018 --> 00:44:38,477
This has the details of
him talking to his mother

705
00:44:38,477 --> 00:44:41,352
And our client was taking to
his mom for 150 seconds

706
00:44:41,393 --> 00:44:42,685
After he ended the call

707
00:44:42,727 --> 00:44:45,602
exactly after 90 seconds, he
himself informed the police.

708
00:44:45,602 --> 00:44:47,102
Now the question is?

709
00:44:47,102 --> 00:44:50,393
is it possible to commit
that murder in 90 seconds.

710
00:44:50,435 --> 00:44:52,935
Sir we can compare both
the call records

711
00:44:52,977 --> 00:44:55,018
And prove that
our client was innocent.

712
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:56,977
The thing is...

713
00:44:57,393 --> 00:45:00,352
if we submit all these
details to the court

714
00:45:00,810 --> 00:45:03,227
we can say that,

715
00:45:03,852 --> 00:45:07,518
the police did not
investigate properly.

716
00:45:08,810 --> 00:45:09,727
But...

717
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:12,518
It's hard to say that our client
did not commit the murder.

718
00:45:12,768 --> 00:45:14,143
Sir, more than that

719
00:45:14,143 --> 00:45:16,435
there are fingerprints
on the weapon.

720
00:45:16,477 --> 00:45:18,852
What do we say about that?

721
00:45:18,893 --> 00:45:21,268
and how can we prove that
it's not his fingerprints

722
00:45:21,727 --> 00:45:22,768
So...

723
00:45:22,810 --> 00:45:24,018
I feel

724
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:26,518
what we need for this
case is a proper witness

725
00:45:26,977 --> 00:45:29,643
She's right because
when the murder occurred

726
00:45:29,935 --> 00:45:32,518
there should have been an eye
witness to the Murder

727
00:45:32,852 --> 00:45:35,602
or we need someone who says

728
00:45:35,602 --> 00:45:38,685
our client was not
present at the crime scene

729
00:45:39,435 --> 00:45:42,810
So now we need
one proper witness

730
00:45:43,352 --> 00:45:45,685
to prove that
our client is innocent

731
00:45:59,727 --> 00:46:01,518
Open the door.

732
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,227
Open it.
- Sir..

733
00:46:03,268 --> 00:46:06,185
Come on. Open it.
- Sir, please Sir..

734
00:46:06,393 --> 00:46:08,810
Sir, please let me go...
I'm not what you think

735
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:11,935
Do you think I'll let you go?

736
00:46:12,018 --> 00:46:13,852
Open the door

737
00:46:13,852 --> 00:46:15,227
Sir, please...
[crying]

738
00:46:15,268 --> 00:46:17,602
Open the door.

739
00:46:19,435 --> 00:46:21,727
Sir please Sir, don't..

740
00:46:21,768 --> 00:46:23,185
Don't.

741
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:28,227
Oh, a knife..

742
00:46:28,352 --> 00:46:30,227
Please don't come near
- Will you stab?

743
00:46:30,227 --> 00:46:32,060
Please Sir don't.

744
00:46:32,477 --> 00:46:34,352
Please let me go Sir..

745
00:46:34,435 --> 00:46:37,227
Throw that.
Look nothing will happen.

746
00:46:37,268 --> 00:46:38,935
Just 2 minutes,
- Please Sir, don't

747
00:46:38,977 --> 00:46:40,518
Everything will be finished.

748
00:46:40,518 --> 00:46:43,268
Sir, please don't...
- Come don't waste any time.

749
00:46:43,268 --> 00:46:45,310
Sir please stop it..

750
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:49,643
What are you doing!?
Are you going to kill him?

751
00:46:49,685 --> 00:46:51,602
Come out of here.

752
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:55,268
Though you know about these
places, you comeback

753
00:46:55,310 --> 00:46:57,102
and then you say about
being independent

754
00:46:57,143 --> 00:46:59,560
You can be independent
only if you are alive

755
00:46:59,935 --> 00:47:02,602
Why are you still holding it?
Can't you understand?

756
00:47:03,018 --> 00:47:04,102
Give it..

757
00:47:07,143 --> 00:47:09,643
First, I'll leave you to the bus stop.
You go to your native place

758
00:47:09,685 --> 00:47:11,352
Call your friends.
-I don't have any.

759
00:47:11,393 --> 00:47:12,685
Sit down.

760
00:47:12,685 --> 00:47:15,018
This place is very
bad. Its risky.

761
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:18,185
They will surely comeback
looking for you

762
00:47:18,227 --> 00:47:19,852
First, you should
leave this city.

763
00:47:19,893 --> 00:47:22,227
Do you have any friends
or family in any other city?

764
00:47:22,227 --> 00:47:24,685
Call them.
I'll send you there

765
00:47:59,893 --> 00:48:01,310
So that's the reason

766
00:48:01,310 --> 00:48:04,518
that bar owner did not become
a witness in this case

767
00:48:05,102 --> 00:48:06,560
And now I know

768
00:48:06,893 --> 00:48:12,227
How the police got the knife
with your fingerprints

769
00:48:12,727 --> 00:48:15,685
So now we just have
to find that girl

770
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:19,310
We'll find answers
to all these questions

771
00:48:19,602 --> 00:48:21,560
But how do we find her?

772
00:48:25,477 --> 00:48:28,643
These sketches are very beautiful
- My son drew them

773
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:32,977
You know sketching faces right?

774
00:48:33,018 --> 00:48:34,060
Yes.

775
00:48:48,185 --> 00:48:49,768
Sir
- yes

776
00:48:49,810 --> 00:48:51,643
Isn't the lady very beautiful?

777
00:48:51,685 --> 00:48:53,060
As soon as we find her

778
00:48:53,102 --> 00:48:55,352
we should enquire
whether she's married.

779
00:48:56,185 --> 00:48:58,768
Think about
how to find the girl

780
00:48:58,893 --> 00:49:01,560
Sir, you don't worry about that.

781
00:49:01,602 --> 00:49:02,352
Why!?

782
00:49:02,393 --> 00:49:04,893
We'll find her using technology

783
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:06,435
I have a friend.

784
00:49:06,477 --> 00:49:07,893
I once gave him my ex-lovers pic

785
00:49:08,185 --> 00:49:10,768
requesting him
to search for her online

786
00:49:10,810 --> 00:49:12,935
He found her in just a week.

787
00:49:14,643 --> 00:49:18,018
Sir, which idiot told you, that
we can find people like this

788
00:49:19,643 --> 00:49:21,727
Did he say that?

789
00:49:21,727 --> 00:49:24,935
Last time when I asked
you to find my GF

790
00:49:24,935 --> 00:49:27,643
Didn't you find her in
Facebook using the pic

791
00:49:27,643 --> 00:49:29,310
you basXXXX..
- Don't scold

792
00:49:29,602 --> 00:49:31,435
I wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t

793
00:49:31,685 --> 00:49:33,310
I found her
profile easily because

794
00:49:33,310 --> 00:49:35,518
the photo you gave and her
FB profile pic were same

795
00:49:35,935 --> 00:49:37,185
If we search using this Sketch

796
00:49:37,227 --> 00:49:39,643
we'll just find similar sketches

797
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:40,727
If it was so easy,

798
00:49:40,768 --> 00:49:43,727
wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the police upload all
criminals sketches and catch them.

799
00:49:43,768 --> 00:49:45,268
You are right?
- OK

800
00:49:45,685 --> 00:49:48,060
Now, what other options do we have?

801
00:49:48,602 --> 00:49:49,893
Sir, give me one Photo?

802
00:49:49,935 --> 00:49:52,393
Why just one,
I'll give you ten

803
00:49:52,393 --> 00:49:54,477
Don't say that...

804
00:49:54,643 --> 00:49:57,977
I was saying,
donate your eyes

805
00:49:57,977 --> 00:50:00,560
He asked for that
girls Photo not yours.

806
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:01,560
Nonsense

807
00:50:02,810 --> 00:50:04,227
Can you find her
if you get a photo?

808
00:50:04,268 --> 00:50:06,060
Yes Sir.

809
00:50:52,185 --> 00:50:53,768
Good morning Sir
- Good morning

810
00:50:53,810 --> 00:50:55,893
Did you enquire about that
girl in the hotel?

811
00:50:55,893 --> 00:50:58,852
I enquired Sir.
That girl is on leave now.

812
00:50:58,893 --> 00:51:00,185
I gave them my number

813
00:51:00,185 --> 00:51:02,477
and requested them
to contact me ASAP

814
00:51:02,602 --> 00:51:04,935
Did you get any other
info about that girl?

815
00:51:04,977 --> 00:51:06,268
Nothing much Sir..

816
00:51:06,310 --> 00:51:07,893
Excuse me Sir,
Boss is calling you.

817
00:51:07,893 --> 00:51:08,893
Ok, I'll come in a minute.

818
00:51:08,935 --> 00:51:10,643
He wants you there,
right now.

819
00:51:10,685 --> 00:51:11,685
Why?

820
00:51:11,768 --> 00:51:13,352
Somebody's here
to meet you.

821
00:51:13,393 --> 00:51:14,393
OK.

822
00:51:33,268 --> 00:51:34,602
Excuse me Sir.

823
00:51:34,643 --> 00:51:36,685
You called me?
- yes

824
00:51:37,352 --> 00:51:41,060
Public prosecutor
Parthasarathy is here.

825
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:43,643
To talk about Vishnu's case

826
00:51:43,727 --> 00:51:47,268
Because he was the one who
handled that case 8 years ago.

827
00:51:47,977 --> 00:51:49,893
So before we talk to him

828
00:51:49,893 --> 00:51:52,310
understand basic things
like ABC

829
00:51:53,102 --> 00:51:54,268
What's ABC

830
00:51:54,352 --> 00:51:56,352
Always Be Careful

831
00:51:57,602 --> 00:51:58,602
Oh!

832
00:52:02,310 --> 00:52:04,518
Hello, How are you?

833
00:52:04,852 --> 00:52:05,893
First class Sir

834
00:52:05,935 --> 00:52:07,310
How are you?
- Fine

835
00:52:07,352 --> 00:52:08,893
Please sit down.
- Thank you

836
00:52:11,643 --> 00:52:13,352
Good morning Sir.

837
00:52:13,643 --> 00:52:15,227
Good morning Mahesh

838
00:52:15,352 --> 00:52:17,393
How are you?
- Fine sir

839
00:52:18,352 --> 00:52:19,727
What's the matter?

840
00:52:19,893 --> 00:52:22,060
Nothing much,
Just a casual visit

841
00:52:23,102 --> 00:52:26,727
Sir,lawyers,doctors and police

842
00:52:27,018 --> 00:52:29,852
don't meet anyone
without any reason.

843
00:52:30,477 --> 00:52:31,643
It's ok,
What's the matter

844
00:52:31,643 --> 00:52:32,935
Mahesh
- Sir..

845
00:52:33,352 --> 00:52:34,352
Sorry Sir.

846
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:36,727
I studied that case in detail.

847
00:52:37,977 --> 00:52:40,643
He sent an innocent to jail

848
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:42,185
Unfairly.

849
00:52:42,227 --> 00:52:43,685
Sir it's OK.

850
00:52:43,977 --> 00:52:45,935
I'm not here to fight about it.

851
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:47,727
A philosopher once said

852
00:52:48,018 --> 00:52:50,185
knowledge is like a river

853
00:52:50,477 --> 00:52:52,685
On the top the river's noise is high.

854
00:52:53,352 --> 00:52:55,893
As we go deeper the
noise Decreases

855
00:52:56,977 --> 00:52:59,227
I got info that
you need a job

856
00:53:00,018 --> 00:53:02,768
and also that you are
working here on temporary basis.

857
00:53:06,310 --> 00:53:09,185
Sir, if you don't mind
I have an offer for him.

858
00:53:09,435 --> 00:53:10,435
OK.

859
00:53:10,935 --> 00:53:13,643
Life gives just one
opportunity to everyone.

860
00:53:13,810 --> 00:53:14,852
But...

861
00:53:15,393 --> 00:53:17,477
I'm giving you a second chance.

862
00:53:19,685 --> 00:53:22,143
I'm starting
a construction company

863
00:53:22,435 --> 00:53:24,060
you can join it.

864
00:53:24,810 --> 00:53:26,935
Keep winning the race with me aside

865
00:53:27,102 --> 00:53:28,852
just to see how far I have run.

866
00:53:28,893 --> 00:53:31,060
You have to run a long way.

867
00:53:34,477 --> 00:53:35,477
Sir

868
00:53:36,935 --> 00:53:38,560
It doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t matter who's ahead

869
00:53:38,602 --> 00:53:40,602
in the beginning of the race.

870
00:53:40,727 --> 00:53:42,393
What matters is

871
00:53:42,393 --> 00:53:45,602
who is ahead while the
race is being finished.

872
00:53:46,143 --> 00:53:47,893
You have learnt to speak well.

873
00:53:48,268 --> 00:53:49,352
Sir

874
00:53:49,393 --> 00:53:51,143
Sun gives us light

875
00:53:51,393 --> 00:53:53,143
And even the tube-light
gives us light

876
00:53:53,435 --> 00:53:55,060
We worship the Sun

877
00:53:55,685 --> 00:53:57,185
But not the tube-light.

878
00:53:58,310 --> 00:53:59,768
If a guy questions it

879
00:53:59,810 --> 00:54:01,602
we don't call him intelligent

880
00:54:03,310 --> 00:54:05,018
We call him an idiot.

881
00:54:06,185 --> 00:54:08,435
The more you try to
prove your intellect

882
00:54:08,477 --> 00:54:09,977
you become a gander.

883
00:54:11,227 --> 00:54:13,810
You can't win a case
just with enthusiasm.

884
00:54:14,518 --> 00:54:16,852
You need a lot of homework.

885
00:54:18,518 --> 00:54:19,518
Good luck.

886
00:54:19,643 --> 00:54:20,643
See you Sir.

887
00:54:26,435 --> 00:54:29,810
Firstly, I would like to ask
forgiveness for all my mistakes

888
00:54:29,852 --> 00:54:33,518
As you said, jail environment
has made me humane.

889
00:54:33,602 --> 00:54:35,518
Without being hot-headed...

890
00:54:35,518 --> 00:54:38,685
I wish to live as a good
civilian in society.

891
00:54:38,768 --> 00:54:42,352
And as I have to look after
my mother in her old age

892
00:54:42,435 --> 00:54:44,102
please consider my age

893
00:54:44,102 --> 00:54:47,185
as the murder committed
was not intentional.

894
00:54:47,185 --> 00:54:49,727
I kindly request you to
please give me another chance

895
00:54:49,768 --> 00:54:51,727
and allow me to lead
life in a righteous way.

896
00:54:51,768 --> 00:54:53,518
Yours faithfully, Vishnu.

897
00:54:59,685 --> 00:55:01,602
Hello sir.
- Where are you?

898
00:55:01,602 --> 00:55:04,393
I am picking up my
cousin from bus stop

899
00:55:04,435 --> 00:55:06,435
Did you sign any
letter to the judge?

900
00:55:06,435 --> 00:55:08,227
Which letter are you
talking about Sir?

901
00:55:08,268 --> 00:55:09,435
Confession letter.

902
00:55:09,435 --> 00:55:12,060
Did you sign a letter to the judge?
Stating you committed the murder?

903
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:14,935
Sir the situation was such.
That's the reason I did that.

904
00:55:14,977 --> 00:55:16,268
What! Did you sign?

905
00:55:16,518 --> 00:55:19,685
F*** the situation,
Why didn't you say this to me?

906
00:55:19,685 --> 00:55:22,143
Are you kidding with me?

907
00:55:22,227 --> 00:55:25,018
On one end, you say
I never murdered.

908
00:55:25,018 --> 00:55:27,102
On the other end you
gave a letter to the Judge.

909
00:55:27,143 --> 00:55:28,977
Stating I committed the murder

910
00:55:29,018 --> 00:55:30,852
Are you guys playing...

911
00:55:30,852 --> 00:55:32,685
Sir I don't care whether
you believe me or not

912
00:55:32,727 --> 00:55:34,560
I did not commit the
murder. And you know that.

913
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:36,477
Yes, Now I'm getting it.

914
00:55:36,518 --> 00:55:38,310
You gave this
confession letter..

915
00:55:38,310 --> 00:55:39,352
Oh!

916
00:55:39,643 --> 00:55:40,935
Hello Sir..

917
00:55:41,310 --> 00:55:42,685
Hello Sir..

918
00:55:43,268 --> 00:55:44,602
Sir..

919
00:56:08,643 --> 00:56:10,102
What are you doing?

920
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:13,810
Dude
- Hi

921
00:56:14,685 --> 00:56:16,518
How are you?
- better

922
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:17,810
I have some pain.

923
00:56:17,852 --> 00:56:19,352
Pain! Doctor he's having pain

924
00:56:19,393 --> 00:56:21,560
Shhh. Why did you
bring him here?

925
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:23,018
Always over reacts

926
00:56:23,143 --> 00:56:24,185
How are you?

927
00:56:26,477 --> 00:56:27,768
Feeling better now

928
00:56:27,935 --> 00:56:30,435
Look what you have done
for yourself idiot.

929
00:56:32,227 --> 00:56:33,102
Look.

930
00:56:33,102 --> 00:56:35,310
I don't think this
was an accident.

931
00:56:35,518 --> 00:56:36,893
I think it was plotted.

932
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:38,518
What do you think Shastri?

933
00:56:38,727 --> 00:56:40,227
Even I feel the same.

934
00:56:40,268 --> 00:56:41,727
Your madam started it again.

935
00:56:41,768 --> 00:56:43,518
Your life is in danger.

936
00:56:43,518 --> 00:56:45,768
Now, Do you want
this case?

937
00:56:47,393 --> 00:56:48,768
Look

938
00:56:51,102 --> 00:56:52,935
As it is tough to make children

939
00:56:52,935 --> 00:56:55,060
You shouldnâ€™t marry
a pregnant woman

940
00:56:55,102 --> 00:56:57,352
What timing!
Even when you are hurt.

941
00:56:57,352 --> 00:56:58,935
Please don't do it
madam, it's painful.

942
00:56:58,977 --> 00:57:00,893
Can you guys get serious?

943
00:57:00,977 --> 00:57:02,768
Get serious man.

944
00:57:03,477 --> 00:57:05,352
Sir, What she's
saying is right.

945
00:57:07,310 --> 00:57:09,268
Sir they fear punishment

946
00:57:09,685 --> 00:57:11,227
but not the law.

947
00:57:11,518 --> 00:57:13,102
Think of it seriously

948
00:57:16,685 --> 00:57:17,977
Ah!

949
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:20,685
Do you guys
have any shame?

950
00:57:21,310 --> 00:57:22,727
We are lawyers

951
00:57:23,227 --> 00:57:24,977
How can you guys
talk like this.

952
00:57:25,227 --> 00:57:27,102
This is common
in our profession

953
00:57:27,185 --> 00:57:29,602
And firstly I'm
not sad about this.

954
00:57:30,393 --> 00:57:32,185
Sad thing is...

955
00:57:32,852 --> 00:57:35,102
I believed that guy

956
00:57:36,143 --> 00:57:38,143
but he lied to me.

957
00:57:38,310 --> 00:57:39,310
That thing

958
00:57:39,477 --> 00:57:42,102
Even though he knew about
the confession letter

959
00:57:42,143 --> 00:57:43,852
He kept it a secret from me.

960
00:57:43,893 --> 00:57:44,893
That's hurting me.

961
00:57:45,393 --> 00:57:46,768
Vishnu

962
00:57:46,768 --> 00:57:48,810
Every evidence is against us

963
00:57:48,810 --> 00:57:51,685
There is only one way
to get you out of here

964
00:57:51,810 --> 00:57:53,518
Confession letter.

965
00:57:53,518 --> 00:57:55,893
Give us a letter saying
that you are the murderer

966
00:57:55,893 --> 00:57:57,893
Saying this was not a
motivational murder

967
00:57:57,893 --> 00:57:59,268
but an accidental death.

968
00:57:59,268 --> 00:58:01,560
It means, it was
not pre-planned

969
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:04,727
but an accident. Lets
submit this to the court

970
00:58:04,768 --> 00:58:06,227
Then your term will be decreased

971
00:58:06,227 --> 00:58:07,727
And your financial status is weak

972
00:58:07,768 --> 00:58:09,352
Your mother's health is weak

973
00:58:09,393 --> 00:58:11,518
But Sir, if he signs that

974
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:13,977
He's accepting that he
committed the murder

975
00:58:13,977 --> 00:58:16,310
Sir he did not commit the murder.

976
00:58:16,352 --> 00:58:17,727
Don't sign it.

977
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:19,393
I will get you out.

978
00:58:19,477 --> 00:58:20,477
Son believe me

979
00:58:20,518 --> 00:58:22,477
If you don't Sign, You'll
rot to death in jail

980
00:58:22,518 --> 00:58:23,977
Then who'll take
care of your mother?

981
00:58:24,018 --> 00:58:25,227
Think carefully

982
00:58:25,227 --> 00:58:27,977
That knife has your finger prints
- Sir why are you doing this.

983
00:58:28,018 --> 00:58:30,018
They have the evidence
- Sir, you said you'll help!

984
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:32,018
Any lawyer can prove
you are the murderer

985
00:58:32,018 --> 00:58:33,935
Sir, if he signs it
he'll be convicted

986
00:58:33,935 --> 00:58:34,977
Mom, he's saying
I can come out.

987
00:58:35,018 --> 00:58:36,143
But you are asking me
not to sign.

988
00:58:36,143 --> 00:58:37,435
I can't stay
here anymore

989
00:58:37,435 --> 00:58:39,227
I want to come outside
at any cost.

990
00:58:39,268 --> 00:58:41,560
I can't bear to see you like this

991
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:43,477
Mom, please understand.
I want to be with you.

992
00:58:43,518 --> 00:58:45,143
I want to help you

993
00:58:45,185 --> 00:58:46,893
He's helping me
get out of here

994
00:58:46,935 --> 00:58:48,852
He's giving me a life

995
00:58:48,893 --> 00:58:51,185
If I sign this letter,
I can come out mom.

996
00:58:51,185 --> 00:58:54,352
I will fight for you, at any
cost, but don't sign it.

997
00:59:05,143 --> 00:59:06,185
Hey...

998
00:59:06,227 --> 00:59:07,352
Hey Vishnu...

999
00:59:07,393 --> 00:59:08,893
Come here, listen to me.

1000
00:59:08,935 --> 00:59:10,685
Shastri, go get him.

1001
00:59:14,727 --> 00:59:16,102
Vishnu listen to me

1002
00:59:16,143 --> 00:59:17,352
Sir, please go away.

1003
00:59:17,393 --> 00:59:18,893
Vishnu listen to what
I have to say.

1004
00:59:18,893 --> 00:59:20,227
I don't want to.

1005
00:59:20,893 --> 00:59:22,310
Your friend Sheela
is on the call

1006
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:23,977
From Mysore.
Please talk

1007
00:59:27,143 --> 00:59:27,935
Hello

1008
01:00:12,977 --> 01:00:15,018
Please don't mistake me

1009
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:16,643
For asking this.

1010
01:00:17,435 --> 01:00:20,060
My case has been re-opened

1011
01:00:21,977 --> 01:00:24,768
Can you be my witness in the court?

1012
01:00:25,893 --> 01:00:27,727
Stating I was with
you that night?

1013
01:00:33,352 --> 01:00:34,477
The thing is...

1014
01:00:34,518 --> 01:00:36,268
If you become my witness

1015
01:00:36,643 --> 01:00:38,518
it will help me a lot

1016
01:00:39,977 --> 01:00:41,018
Please.

1017
01:00:49,518 --> 01:00:51,393
This life is like...

1018
01:00:53,352 --> 01:00:55,893
It says there's a
thorn with the rose

1019
01:00:57,518 --> 01:00:59,060
Be happy

1020
01:01:00,935 --> 01:01:02,852
Same way it says..

1021
01:01:03,977 --> 01:01:06,602
there's a rose with the thorn

1022
01:01:07,185 --> 01:01:08,935
Be sad

1023
01:01:12,143 --> 01:01:13,685
I'm like that rose

1024
01:01:16,935 --> 01:01:18,018
Now...

1025
01:01:19,810 --> 01:01:21,560
I come to work at 9AM

1026
01:01:23,060 --> 01:01:24,768
And go back home at 6PM.

1027
01:01:27,893 --> 01:01:29,227
Now I have a loving husband,

1028
01:01:31,352 --> 01:01:33,185
My own family...

1029
01:01:35,685 --> 01:01:37,602
In this situation...

1030
01:01:40,935 --> 01:01:42,852
Earlier...

1031
01:01:44,685 --> 01:01:46,893
I used to
work in a pub.

1032
01:01:50,227 --> 01:01:51,810
Now, if I say...

1033
01:01:54,852 --> 01:01:57,435
rape was attempted on me

1034
01:02:01,810 --> 01:02:03,685
my life loses its meaning

1035
01:02:06,227 --> 01:02:08,685
You helped me a lot that day.

1036
01:02:10,518 --> 01:02:13,060
I Got a new life because of you.

1037
01:02:19,185 --> 01:02:20,768
But...

1038
01:02:23,852 --> 01:02:25,810
Today...

1039
01:02:29,435 --> 01:02:30,685
I'm Sorry.

1040
01:03:09,102 --> 01:03:11,352
Hello.
- Where are you now?

1041
01:03:11,393 --> 01:03:14,185
In the bus stop
- I forgot to tell you something

1042
01:03:14,185 --> 01:03:15,727
9 months after you
went to jail,

1043
01:03:15,768 --> 01:03:17,185
there was an article
in the paper

1044
01:03:17,227 --> 01:03:19,560
about that murder,
I have that paper.

1045
01:03:19,602 --> 01:03:21,643
I think,
it will help you

1046
01:03:21,685 --> 01:03:24,185
Can you come to the hotel fast?
- Yeah, I'm coming

1047
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:41,102
Ok, this evidence is sufficient.

1048
01:05:41,143 --> 01:05:41,935
OK.

1049
01:05:41,977 --> 01:05:44,435
But why did you guys put
a pen camera on him?

1050
01:05:44,477 --> 01:05:47,018
Sir actually that guy
is out on parole now.

1051
01:05:47,060 --> 01:05:50,185
So we did that as a
safety precaution.

1052
01:05:51,977 --> 01:05:53,810
Can I get a
copy of the parole

1053
01:05:53,852 --> 01:05:55,018
Sure Sir...

1054
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:56,727
Here it is Sir.

1055
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:00,602
Sir, I have a doubt

1056
01:06:01,102 --> 01:06:03,477
Sir how did you know,
someone was murdered there?

1057
01:06:03,477 --> 01:06:06,810
We got an anonymous call,
and we followed the lead.

1058
01:06:10,893 --> 01:06:13,060
So Sir can we take that
guy with us?

1059
01:06:13,102 --> 01:06:14,018
Sure.

1060
01:06:14,060 --> 01:06:16,560
But, let me have
a copy of this.

1061
01:06:17,060 --> 01:06:19,143
If necessary, you might
have to bring him back

1062
01:06:19,143 --> 01:06:20,352
Yeah, sure sir.

1063
01:06:20,435 --> 01:06:21,643
Nayak take this.

1064
01:06:21,643 --> 01:06:23,435
Make a copy of this.

1065
01:06:24,102 --> 01:06:25,352
Release that guy.
- Thank you Sir.

1066
01:06:25,393 --> 01:06:28,352
Thank You Sir.

1067
01:06:32,060 --> 01:06:35,060
Sir he escaped because
of this camera pen

1068
01:06:35,102 --> 01:06:37,643
Else he would
have rotted in jail

1069
01:06:37,685 --> 01:06:38,935
Shut up.

1070
01:06:39,268 --> 01:06:40,685
Keep it.

1071
01:06:42,935 --> 01:06:45,227
So, there was an
article in the paper

1072
01:06:45,435 --> 01:06:46,935
But...

1073
01:06:47,018 --> 01:06:50,768
Not much news
came out about it

1074
01:06:51,518 --> 01:06:54,310
Shastri call Prakash and enquire

1075
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:57,018
If he knows anything about
this case or the article.

1076
01:06:57,060 --> 01:06:58,935
Good Idea Sir.
- take this.

1077
01:07:10,685 --> 01:07:13,143
It's true about the article.

1078
01:07:13,185 --> 01:07:15,268
But as Inspector
Raghavan was on leave

1079
01:07:15,310 --> 01:07:17,185
someone else
handled that case

1080
01:07:17,227 --> 01:07:18,727
But now he is retired.

1081
01:07:18,727 --> 01:07:21,477
So Prakash said if we enquire with
him we'll get more details

1082
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:23,727
What's his name?

1083
01:07:26,227 --> 01:07:27,768
Pass..

1084
01:07:28,477 --> 01:07:30,143
Pass it that side.

1085
01:07:32,643 --> 01:07:34,435
Don't stand pass it.

1086
01:07:34,435 --> 01:07:36,935
Yeah that was good,
pass it.

1087
01:07:57,060 --> 01:07:59,060
Sir, Do you recognise me?

1088
01:08:01,393 --> 01:08:03,018
How can I forget you?

1089
01:08:04,268 --> 01:08:06,477
Your case was the last
one in my service

1090
01:08:08,893 --> 01:08:10,393
Sir that day...

1091
01:08:10,977 --> 01:08:12,768
After I went to jail

1092
01:08:13,352 --> 01:08:16,143
I got information that
something happened

1093
01:08:19,143 --> 01:08:20,435
What happened Sir?

1094
01:08:28,935 --> 01:08:31,643
9 Months after you went to jail.

1095
01:08:32,685 --> 01:08:35,435
We received a call at our station

1096
01:08:40,227 --> 01:08:42,227
Raghavan was not
present at the station

1097
01:08:42,310 --> 01:08:44,935
So I attended that call.

1098
01:08:44,977 --> 01:08:46,393
Hello...

1099
01:08:46,477 --> 01:08:49,102
Sir, nine months ago

1100
01:08:49,143 --> 01:08:52,143
a taxi driver was murdered
in Maruthi circle

1101
01:08:52,185 --> 01:08:54,643
Sir I know who that murderer is

1102
01:08:54,685 --> 01:08:56,727
It's not the guy you arrested

1103
01:08:56,768 --> 01:08:59,768
I know exactly
what happened there

1104
01:08:59,852 --> 01:09:01,518
I will tell you everything.

1105
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:03,268
Sir, Just tell me when
I should come.

1106
01:09:03,268 --> 01:09:04,560
I'll explain everything to you

1107
01:09:04,602 --> 01:09:06,143
Who are you?

1108
01:09:08,727 --> 01:09:11,477
So Sir, did you find
that Killer?

1109
01:09:19,685 --> 01:09:21,018
This is the place.

1110
01:09:21,018 --> 01:09:23,810
Where I'm planning to
start our new law firm.

1111
01:09:23,852 --> 01:09:25,685
How is it?
- Superb.

1112
01:09:25,977 --> 01:09:27,768
It's right next to a main road.

1113
01:09:27,810 --> 01:09:29,685
It must be very expensive?

1114
01:09:29,685 --> 01:09:31,227
Four lakhs per month.

1115
01:09:31,268 --> 01:09:32,977
Oh God!
- Shastri..

1116
01:09:33,268 --> 01:09:36,185
Four lakhs rent for a
single floor each month?

1117
01:09:36,227 --> 01:09:38,727
Shastri, it is for the
whole building

1118
01:09:38,893 --> 01:09:41,060
Sir, you were saying
my in-law is very stingy

1119
01:09:41,060 --> 01:09:43,060
Gives missed call
even in this Jio Sim era?

1120
01:09:43,102 --> 01:09:45,102
Then how did he arrange
such a huge property?

1121
01:09:45,143 --> 01:09:46,227
Shastri,
What are you saying?

1122
01:09:46,227 --> 01:09:47,685
Have I ever said
anything like that?

1123
01:09:47,685 --> 01:09:48,935
Sir, you said it yourself

1124
01:09:48,977 --> 01:09:50,977
You keep plotting fights
between us

1125
01:09:50,977 --> 01:09:52,268
What I told you was

1126
01:09:52,310 --> 01:09:54,310
my in-Law is a very
generous person

1127
01:09:54,310 --> 01:09:56,435
Not just getting me a Loan

1128
01:09:56,435 --> 01:09:58,435
he even Pays the EMIs.

1129
01:09:58,435 --> 01:10:00,060
He's a Godly human

1130
01:10:00,143 --> 01:10:01,435
No. Golden hearted.

1131
01:10:01,477 --> 01:10:03,102
Can you guys shut up.

1132
01:10:04,893 --> 01:10:08,352
Why do you bring this
monkey everywhere you go?

1133
01:10:08,393 --> 01:10:09,477
Sir, I heard it.

1134
01:10:09,477 --> 01:10:12,018
I heard everything.
- It's not for you Shastri..

1135
01:10:12,060 --> 01:10:14,143
In this era

1136
01:10:14,143 --> 01:10:17,143
When A boy and a girl,
In their prime

1137
01:10:17,185 --> 01:10:19,435
are alone in an under
construction building

1138
01:10:19,435 --> 01:10:22,518
what will people think of it?

1139
01:10:22,518 --> 01:10:25,227
Madam.. Sir, You don't say anything

1140
01:10:25,268 --> 01:10:28,560
I'm thinking about your
well being and you are...

1141
01:10:28,602 --> 01:10:31,810
Who is it calling at this time?
- Who is that?

1142
01:10:31,810 --> 01:10:33,310
Is that our client?

1143
01:10:33,518 --> 01:10:35,227
Reject the call right now.

1144
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:41,060
How long will you keep
fighting such small cases?

1145
01:10:41,393 --> 01:10:42,268
Actually..

1146
01:10:42,310 --> 01:10:43,977
To match your intelligence

1147
01:10:43,977 --> 01:10:45,935
You shouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be doing that.

1148
01:10:45,935 --> 01:10:48,643
You should be doing this.

1149
01:10:49,143 --> 01:10:50,477
OK.

1150
01:10:50,477 --> 01:10:53,227
But for such a huge place
we need lot of investment.

1151
01:10:53,268 --> 01:10:55,185
Then, even after
getting the investment

1152
01:10:55,227 --> 01:10:57,852
Maintaining it at four
lakhs per month

1153
01:10:57,977 --> 01:10:59,643
Is very important.

1154
01:10:59,727 --> 01:11:00,935
Everything is possible.

1155
01:11:00,935 --> 01:11:02,852
We just have to decide.

1156
01:11:03,018 --> 01:11:04,227
What's your problem?

1157
01:11:04,268 --> 01:11:07,393
I'll get all the cases
and investments.

1158
01:11:07,393 --> 01:11:09,810
You just fight the cases.

1159
01:11:09,810 --> 01:11:10,643
Simple.

1160
01:11:10,685 --> 01:11:12,102
But still...

1161
01:11:12,143 --> 01:11:12,977
Look...

1162
01:11:13,018 --> 01:11:14,852
We should run with the times

1163
01:11:14,852 --> 01:11:15,893
or else..

1164
01:11:15,935 --> 01:11:18,393
It will go far ahead of us.

1165
01:11:18,393 --> 01:11:19,643
Think about it.

1166
01:11:19,643 --> 01:11:23,102
Who is it calling again?
- Is that him again?

1167
01:11:23,852 --> 01:11:25,102
Look

1168
01:11:25,143 --> 01:11:28,977
I don't mind taking small
steps towards my goal.

1169
01:11:29,185 --> 01:11:31,810
But I'll never run
towards what I don't like.

1170
01:11:32,018 --> 01:11:34,227
Excuse me,
I'll come back

1171
01:11:35,768 --> 01:11:37,018
Hello, what is it?

1172
01:11:47,685 --> 01:11:50,018
He found the killer.

1173
01:11:56,393 --> 01:11:58,477
Hello Sir, nice meeting you.

1174
01:11:58,518 --> 01:12:00,227
Thank you for
choosing our company

1175
01:12:00,227 --> 01:12:03,477
This is the car you are looking for,
Volkswagen Vento Red

1176
01:12:03,477 --> 01:12:05,310
We ordered it just for you.

1177
01:12:05,310 --> 01:12:07,310
It has crossed just
55000 KM

1178
01:12:07,310 --> 01:12:09,393
And costs 5 Lakhs
- OK

1179
01:12:09,435 --> 01:12:10,893
It has not had any accident

1180
01:12:10,893 --> 01:12:12,352
And the insurance was not
claimed even once.

1181
01:12:12,393 --> 01:12:14,893
It was under a single owner

1182
01:12:14,977 --> 01:12:17,143
and it is a fully loaded model.

1183
01:12:17,268 --> 01:12:18,435
Owned by a doctor.

1184
01:12:18,435 --> 01:12:21,143
He's selling it,
as he is going abroad.

1185
01:12:21,852 --> 01:12:23,477
Is it a petrol or diesel Car?

1186
01:12:23,518 --> 01:12:24,727
It's a Petrol Car..

1187
01:12:24,768 --> 01:12:26,310
With 1.2 litre engine capacity

1188
01:12:27,352 --> 01:12:29,477
Even the exterior
looks very good

1189
01:12:29,477 --> 01:12:31,852
Yes sir. He wasn't
using the car much.

1190
01:12:31,852 --> 01:12:33,393
Just house to car and back.

1191
01:12:33,393 --> 01:12:35,060
Other than that nothing much

1192
01:12:35,060 --> 01:12:37,602
You can talk to the owner about
the price. He's on the way.

1193
01:12:37,602 --> 01:12:38,477
Excuse me for a minute Sir.

1194
01:12:38,518 --> 01:12:40,727
Hello sir,
how can I help you?

1195
01:12:50,643 --> 01:12:52,935
Give me Ten minutes,
we'll talk

1196
01:12:52,935 --> 01:12:54,935
You've got the right job
for yourself.

1197
01:12:54,935 --> 01:12:57,935
Selling someone's car
to the other

1198
01:12:58,727 --> 01:13:02,393
Framing a murder committed
by someone on others

1199
01:13:02,727 --> 01:13:03,935
Am I right?

1200
01:14:00,518 --> 01:14:01,935
Hello Sir
- Where are you?

1201
01:14:01,977 --> 01:14:04,685
Sir, I'm in the parking lot.
- I'm coming

1202
01:14:07,185 --> 01:14:09,810
Hello...

1203
01:14:11,268 --> 01:14:12,727
Vishnu!

1204
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:14,685
Vishnu!

1205
01:14:14,852 --> 01:14:16,477
Vishnu!

1206
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:19,185
Vishnu!

1207
01:14:22,810 --> 01:14:24,477
Sir, Please help me

1208
01:14:24,852 --> 01:14:26,185
Sir, He's a murderer

1209
01:14:26,185 --> 01:14:27,810
Why is he trying to kill you?

1210
01:14:27,810 --> 01:14:29,643
Sir, it's a long story.

1211
01:14:29,685 --> 01:14:31,810
Sir, I'll explain it to you
later. Please save me.

1212
01:14:31,810 --> 01:14:32,935
Please Sir..

1213
01:14:32,935 --> 01:14:35,935
I'm here to listen to
that long story.

1214
01:14:39,143 --> 01:14:40,268
Come this side

1215
01:14:40,310 --> 01:14:41,685
Come, come here...

1216
01:15:17,102 --> 01:15:19,352
Properly, say who you are.

1217
01:15:19,352 --> 01:15:22,352
And what happened that night.

1218
01:15:23,102 --> 01:15:25,185
Else I'll...

1219
01:15:28,185 --> 01:15:29,352
I will tell you Sir..

1220
01:15:30,185 --> 01:15:31,227
Sir...

1221
01:15:31,268 --> 01:15:34,060
I'm a petty thief

1222
01:15:36,602 --> 01:15:38,018
chain snatching

1223
01:15:38,102 --> 01:15:40,685
robbery and small stuff

1224
01:15:42,477 --> 01:15:44,685
When not many cases get
registered in the station

1225
01:15:44,727 --> 01:15:47,018
Raghavan would let us out

1226
01:15:47,018 --> 01:15:48,977
to do some robbery

1227
01:15:53,018 --> 01:15:56,352
Even that day we went
out to do a robbery

1228
01:15:58,102 --> 01:16:01,560
Taxi service was just
getting started in Bangalore

1229
01:16:01,727 --> 01:16:05,602
It was too easy to rob
those taxi drivers

1230
01:16:05,810 --> 01:16:09,393
So, that day,
I booked a taxi.

1231
01:16:09,435 --> 01:16:10,518
But...

1232
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:13,393
That taxi driver was adamant

1233
01:16:13,727 --> 01:16:16,643
I was drunk and high.

1234
01:16:16,810 --> 01:16:20,227
I stabbed him as I was tense
and took everything he had.

1235
01:16:20,268 --> 01:16:21,727
and ran from there

1236
01:16:21,727 --> 01:16:22,810
Then...

1237
01:16:23,435 --> 01:16:25,685
Oh! I asked him to rob

1238
01:16:26,018 --> 01:16:27,560
And he committed murder!

1239
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:29,685
How do I deal with it?

1240
01:16:31,768 --> 01:16:33,602
Where did he go?

1241
01:16:33,768 --> 01:16:34,977
Murthy
- Sir..

1242
01:16:35,018 --> 01:16:37,727
Are you trying?
- Yes Sir..

1243
01:16:40,602 --> 01:16:42,518
It's the bloody police.

1244
01:16:43,893 --> 01:16:46,185
I will switch off my phone.

1245
01:16:46,352 --> 01:16:48,727
Let me see what they can do.

1246
01:16:49,435 --> 01:16:51,435
Sir his phone is switched off.

1247
01:16:52,435 --> 01:16:55,352
Sir, a cab
driver is dead

1248
01:16:55,685 --> 01:16:58,477
If the cab driver's
union gets this news

1249
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:00,018
it will be a huge controversy

1250
01:17:00,143 --> 01:17:02,435
We should catch him fast

1251
01:17:03,768 --> 01:17:05,435
You have murdered a guy

1252
01:17:05,727 --> 01:17:08,393
If police finds out
they will not let you go

1253
01:17:09,185 --> 01:17:11,060
If they touch me

1254
01:17:11,393 --> 01:17:13,727
I will reveal their secret

1255
01:17:13,768 --> 01:17:14,768
Sir...

1256
01:17:15,852 --> 01:17:18,102
What if he came
outside and said...

1257
01:17:18,143 --> 01:17:20,560
police themselves led the thieves

1258
01:17:20,602 --> 01:17:23,435
to rob people as there were
not many cases registered

1259
01:17:24,477 --> 01:17:26,852
This will become an
huge news in the media

1260
01:17:28,352 --> 01:17:30,727
Sir then all of us will be seized..

1261
01:17:31,268 --> 01:17:32,393
OK

1262
01:17:32,435 --> 01:17:34,393
Give that knife phone

1263
01:17:34,435 --> 01:17:36,518
and the items you robbed.

1264
01:17:37,602 --> 01:17:39,893
First remove that
shirt and go shower

1265
01:17:40,518 --> 01:17:43,643
I will think of a plan.

1266
01:17:44,018 --> 01:17:45,643
This is a lot of headache...

1267
01:17:46,060 --> 01:17:47,018
But...

1268
01:17:47,143 --> 01:17:49,393
Nine months after that

1269
01:17:49,852 --> 01:17:51,435
Just because

1270
01:17:51,477 --> 01:17:55,185
my friend's sister loved me

1271
01:17:55,810 --> 01:17:59,435
he called the police station.

1272
01:18:00,643 --> 01:18:02,810
while Raghavan was not
in the police station

1273
01:18:02,852 --> 01:18:05,477
and informed them
about the murder.

1274
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:07,060
Then...

1275
01:18:10,102 --> 01:18:12,893
Where are the robbed items?

1276
01:18:13,227 --> 01:18:15,727
Phone, chain and the purse
- Sir that..

1277
01:18:16,268 --> 01:18:19,477
Sir, as we were afraid,
I burnt everything.

1278
01:18:21,143 --> 01:18:24,018
Then what is the proof
that he is the killer?

1279
01:18:24,185 --> 01:18:26,435
After committing the murder
he directly came to my room

1280
01:18:26,435 --> 01:18:29,518
I myself disposed the
knife he used for the murder.

1281
01:18:29,518 --> 01:18:31,435
I will become a
witness for this case

1282
01:18:31,477 --> 01:18:32,685
You M****r f****r..

1283
01:18:32,727 --> 01:18:34,852
Playing dirty tricks with me..

1284
01:18:35,018 --> 01:18:38,018
Giving shelter to a
killer is not a crime

1285
01:18:38,227 --> 01:18:40,268
But letting your sister
marry him is a crime

1286
01:18:40,268 --> 01:18:41,477
Am I right?

1287
01:18:41,643 --> 01:18:44,602
Giving him shelter was a crime.

1288
01:18:45,310 --> 01:18:48,060
Do you know what punishment
you'll get for that?

1289
01:18:48,102 --> 01:18:51,727
Sir, if you want to
end someone's life

1290
01:18:52,310 --> 01:18:54,810
you have to sacrifice a lot.

1291
01:18:55,352 --> 01:18:56,352
Rajesh

1292
01:18:57,018 --> 01:18:59,018
record his statement

1293
01:18:59,268 --> 01:19:00,727
and file an FIR

1294
01:19:01,018 --> 01:19:02,810
After all this

1295
01:19:03,310 --> 01:19:05,852
That case was re-opened.

1296
01:19:06,185 --> 01:19:10,060
An article was also
published in the papers

1297
01:19:10,477 --> 01:19:13,810
Officer Raghavan
came back on duty

1298
01:19:13,935 --> 01:19:17,185
and met Public
prosecutor Parthasarathy.

1299
01:19:17,352 --> 01:19:20,102
Then they planned something

1300
01:19:20,143 --> 01:19:22,685
and got us bail.

1301
01:19:23,393 --> 01:19:25,310
As we were out on bail

1302
01:19:25,310 --> 01:19:26,727
They feared

1303
01:19:26,768 --> 01:19:29,060
this case would become
huge if they kill us...

1304
01:19:29,143 --> 01:19:31,893
So Raghavan made a plan

1305
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:34,268
Come here...

1306
01:19:35,310 --> 01:19:36,685
Come fast...

1307
01:19:38,435 --> 01:19:40,143
Will you guys go out
on a 3 month vacation

1308
01:19:40,185 --> 01:19:41,602
without falling on
anybody's eyes?

1309
01:19:41,643 --> 01:19:42,810
Sir please let us go.

1310
01:19:42,852 --> 01:19:45,393
Not just three, we'll
go for six Months

1311
01:19:45,727 --> 01:19:47,185
Murthy
- Sir..

1312
01:19:47,685 --> 01:19:50,643
Get them treated in
Nimhans for six months

1313
01:19:50,643 --> 01:19:52,893
Sir, What are you saying?

1314
01:19:54,185 --> 01:19:56,810
Stay in Nimhans
hospital for six months.

1315
01:19:57,310 --> 01:19:59,227
Doctor will give a
certificate stating

1316
01:19:59,268 --> 01:20:00,768
you were Mentally unstable,

1317
01:20:00,810 --> 01:20:02,310
and now fit.

1318
01:20:02,352 --> 01:20:04,810
Then this case will be closed.

1319
01:20:04,935 --> 01:20:05,935
Look..

1320
01:20:06,893 --> 01:20:10,143
Killing you is not the
best option I have.

1321
01:20:12,435 --> 01:20:13,643
But...

1322
01:20:17,310 --> 01:20:19,643
that is one of the options.

1323
01:20:20,602 --> 01:20:22,768
But Sir,
I'm sure about this

1324
01:20:22,768 --> 01:20:25,935
I did not stab that
cab driver to death

1325
01:20:27,060 --> 01:20:28,727
I can assure you that.

1326
01:20:31,893 --> 01:20:34,352
You said you had a friend.

1327
01:20:35,018 --> 01:20:36,143
What happened to him?

1328
01:20:36,643 --> 01:20:38,185
Sir he...

1329
01:20:38,310 --> 01:20:41,060
Sir he went into depression
in the mental Hospital

1330
01:20:41,393 --> 01:20:44,018
He couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t bear the
shock treatment.

1331
01:20:44,018 --> 01:20:46,643
He died in the hospital.
- Shit..

1332
01:20:49,310 --> 01:20:51,560
Sir, what if we
make him surrender?

1333
01:20:51,602 --> 01:20:54,477
He himself is accepting it,
and the case will be solved.

1334
01:20:54,810 --> 01:20:55,935
No, it's not possible.

1335
01:20:56,018 --> 01:20:58,310
A certificate has
been issued stating

1336
01:20:58,352 --> 01:21:00,227
that he is mentally ill.

1337
01:21:00,643 --> 01:21:03,310
Now if we submit him to court

1338
01:21:03,768 --> 01:21:05,977
his statement will not work

1339
01:21:06,143 --> 01:21:09,518
It will be proven that
he is mentally unstable.

1340
01:21:10,060 --> 01:21:12,727
Sir, I will kill him.
- let him go.

1341
01:21:13,810 --> 01:21:16,143
What are you doing?

1342
01:21:16,685 --> 01:21:19,810
A criminal's punishment
might get delayed

1343
01:21:19,893 --> 01:21:22,060
but he will
surely be punished.

1344
01:21:23,727 --> 01:21:24,727
Shastri..

1345
01:21:25,060 --> 01:21:26,602
Sir, I'll look after it.

1346
01:21:34,352 --> 01:21:35,852
So now...

1347
01:21:35,852 --> 01:21:37,727
The real game begins.

1348
01:21:38,268 --> 01:21:42,602
If Surya did not stab
that cab driver so hard...

1349
01:21:43,393 --> 01:21:46,393
It means he was still alive.

1350
01:21:47,685 --> 01:21:49,518
Then how did he die?

1351
01:21:49,768 --> 01:21:52,102
Did someone else
come there after that?

1352
01:21:52,477 --> 01:21:54,727
How come
nobody saw this murder...

1353
01:21:55,310 --> 01:21:57,477
I need just one clue

1354
01:21:57,685 --> 01:21:59,477
to solve this case

1355
01:21:59,852 --> 01:22:01,643
How do I find that clue?

1356
01:22:02,227 --> 01:22:03,393
How

1357
01:22:04,435 --> 01:22:05,810
Shastri...

1358
01:22:05,935 --> 01:22:07,518
It is such a huge main road

1359
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:10,310
How come not even a single
guy saw that murder

1360
01:22:10,352 --> 01:22:12,102
Sir, why are you
scolding me for that?

1361
01:22:12,143 --> 01:22:14,477
Sir it is an 8 year old case

1362
01:22:14,477 --> 01:22:16,018
Many would have vacated their houses.

1363
01:22:16,060 --> 01:22:18,435
Some would have demolished
and a few would have constructed

1364
01:22:18,435 --> 01:22:19,560
or renovated their house

1365
01:22:19,602 --> 01:22:21,393
How can we go to
each house and ask?

1366
01:22:21,435 --> 01:22:24,393
Madam 8 years ago a
murder occurred here

1367
01:22:24,435 --> 01:22:26,727
Did you see the killer?

1368
01:22:26,727 --> 01:22:28,060
Exactly...

1369
01:22:28,102 --> 01:22:29,810
Even if someone saw
it while passing there

1370
01:22:29,852 --> 01:22:31,060
how do can we
know who that is?

1371
01:22:31,102 --> 01:22:32,685
Give me a five.

1372
01:22:32,727 --> 01:22:34,143
You constructed a house

1373
01:22:34,185 --> 01:22:35,935
Why didn't you
construct it there

1374
01:22:35,977 --> 01:22:37,685
It would have helped the case.
- God!.

1375
01:22:38,018 --> 01:22:39,310
What timing Sir!

1376
01:22:39,352 --> 01:22:41,643
My Mom is calling me,
Let me ask her.

1377
01:22:41,810 --> 01:22:43,060
Hello..

1378
01:22:44,268 --> 01:22:45,852
Did you call me for that?

1379
01:22:45,935 --> 01:22:47,935
Don't disturb me
while I'm at work

1380
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:49,768
Mom, I'm in a meeting.

1381
01:22:49,810 --> 01:22:51,185
Please end the call.

1382
01:22:51,227 --> 01:22:53,018
I'll call you later.

1383
01:22:54,477 --> 01:22:56,727
Sorry sir,
my Mom...

1384
01:22:56,727 --> 01:22:58,852
She was enquiring about

1385
01:22:58,935 --> 01:23:01,602
selling the old paper online

1386
01:23:01,643 --> 01:23:03,768
So she was asking
what was the Price

1387
01:23:04,518 --> 01:23:06,477
So silly you see...

1388
01:23:07,227 --> 01:23:09,643
Selling old paper online...

1389
01:23:28,393 --> 01:23:30,810
Sir, I brought all the paper
clippings you asked for.

1390
01:23:30,852 --> 01:23:33,227
Important events that
occurred in that vicinity

1391
01:23:33,268 --> 01:23:35,102
on March 10th and 11th are...

1392
01:23:35,185 --> 01:23:37,268
Sir there are 6 major events

1393
01:23:37,393 --> 01:23:38,310
First point

1394
01:23:38,352 --> 01:23:41,352
That day Bangalore saw
untimely record-breaking rain

1395
01:23:41,393 --> 01:23:43,643
And Maruthi circle
was drenched heavily

1396
01:23:43,685 --> 01:23:44,727
Ok.
- Point-2

1397
01:23:44,768 --> 01:23:47,352
In the vicinity an RTO
officer's house was raided

1398
01:23:47,393 --> 01:23:47,852
OK.

1399
01:23:47,893 --> 01:23:49,727
Point-3, In Vidya Nagar...

1400
01:23:49,768 --> 01:23:52,768
Shivanna, inaugurated a store
named Raghavendra Garments

1401
01:23:52,768 --> 01:23:53,810
In Vidya Nagar
- Yes

1402
01:23:53,810 --> 01:23:54,227
Ok

1403
01:23:54,268 --> 01:23:55,393
Point 4

1404
01:23:55,435 --> 01:23:58,435
In Maruthi circle 8th
cross, a tree fell

1405
01:23:58,435 --> 01:23:59,643
and 2 people
died on the spot

1406
01:23:59,685 --> 01:24:00,435
Note that down.

1407
01:24:00,477 --> 01:24:01,185
Point 5

1408
01:24:01,227 --> 01:24:03,810
In the same area
a bookie's house was robbed.

1409
01:24:03,810 --> 01:24:04,977
OK.

1410
01:24:05,018 --> 01:24:05,977
Point 6

1411
01:24:06,018 --> 01:24:08,393
Midnight a truck had an
Accident in M.R. layout

1412
01:24:08,435 --> 01:24:10,727
And that driver lost his leg

1413
01:24:11,602 --> 01:24:14,185
At midnight in
M.R.Layout - Yes

1414
01:24:14,727 --> 01:24:16,310
But...

1415
01:24:16,310 --> 01:24:17,727
The taxi driver was murdered

1416
01:24:17,727 --> 01:24:19,268
in Maruthi circle right?

1417
01:24:19,477 --> 01:24:20,560
What's the connection?

1418
01:24:20,602 --> 01:24:21,685
Sir there's a connection

1419
01:24:21,727 --> 01:24:22,768
as I told you earlier

1420
01:24:22,810 --> 01:24:24,643
Shivanna inaugurated
a garments shop.

1421
01:24:24,685 --> 01:24:26,060
In vidya Nagar
- Correct

1422
01:24:26,060 --> 01:24:28,768
It was this truck, returning
after unloading the shipment.

1423
01:24:28,768 --> 01:24:30,060
it's brake failed here.

1424
01:24:30,060 --> 01:24:31,768
Had an accident in M.R.Layout

1425
01:24:31,810 --> 01:24:33,643
And the driver lost his leg

1426
01:24:33,643 --> 01:24:36,102
OK, so the accident
occurred in M.R.Nagar

1427
01:24:36,102 --> 01:24:38,935
after unloading the
shipment in Vidya Nagar

1428
01:24:40,018 --> 01:24:41,393
So... you mean...

1429
01:24:43,102 --> 01:24:45,310
it was supposed to go
through that road

1430
01:24:45,310 --> 01:24:46,643
so, it has to cross

1431
01:24:46,685 --> 01:24:48,268
Maruthi circle
- 100%

1432
01:24:48,477 --> 01:24:49,602
So...

1433
01:24:49,643 --> 01:24:51,268
When did the accident occur?

1434
01:24:51,268 --> 01:24:52,643
Sir at 12:40.

1435
01:24:52,685 --> 01:24:53,727
12:40

1436
01:24:53,768 --> 01:24:55,643
Ok Janu...

1437
01:24:55,810 --> 01:24:59,310
When did Vishnu
call the police?

1438
01:24:59,477 --> 01:25:02,893
12:31:20 seconds

1439
01:25:02,935 --> 01:25:04,352
Shastri...

1440
01:25:04,352 --> 01:25:06,977
How much time does
the truck need

1441
01:25:06,977 --> 01:25:09,685
to travel from Vidya Nagar
to M.R. Layout?

1442
01:25:10,018 --> 01:25:11,643
Sir maximum,
20 Minutes

1443
01:25:11,810 --> 01:25:12,893
20 minutes.

1444
01:25:13,060 --> 01:25:14,018
OK.

1445
01:25:14,060 --> 01:25:16,977
Janu From Vidya Nagar
to Maruthi Circle

1446
01:25:17,018 --> 01:25:19,143
how long does it take
in a truck

1447
01:25:19,477 --> 01:25:20,852
10 minutes max

1448
01:25:20,852 --> 01:25:21,852
10 minutes.

1449
01:25:21,977 --> 01:25:25,685
So if the accident
occurred at 12:40

1450
01:25:25,685 --> 01:25:27,560
he would have
left Vidya Nagar

1451
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:29,018
20 minutes ago.

1452
01:25:29,227 --> 01:25:32,018
So he left Vidya Nagar
at 12:20pm

1453
01:25:32,435 --> 01:25:33,935
If it takes 10 minutes

1454
01:25:33,977 --> 01:25:35,435
he would have crossed

1455
01:25:35,477 --> 01:25:36,727
Maruthi circle at 12:30

1456
01:25:36,727 --> 01:25:39,060
And Vishnu called the police

1457
01:25:39,102 --> 01:25:40,602
at 12:31

1458
01:25:40,852 --> 01:25:43,018
So that truck driver was
there

1459
01:25:43,018 --> 01:25:44,602
when the murder...

1460
01:25:44,810 --> 01:25:45,935
I got it Sir..

1461
01:25:46,185 --> 01:25:48,310
Is that truck driver
dead or alive.

1462
01:25:48,352 --> 01:25:49,935
If dead
I'll get the info about

1463
01:25:49,977 --> 01:25:52,143
what dish was served in
his death ceremony

1464
01:25:52,143 --> 01:25:53,560
Thanks Shastri..
- Ok Sir.

1465
01:25:53,643 --> 01:25:55,435
But I have doubt
- What is it?

1466
01:25:55,477 --> 01:25:57,602
When it comes to
taking decisions

1467
01:25:57,602 --> 01:25:59,393
You ask Janu..

1468
01:25:59,393 --> 01:26:00,685
But when it comes to
collecting

1469
01:26:00,727 --> 01:26:01,768
evidence and witness

1470
01:26:01,810 --> 01:26:04,602
why do you send me
all the time?

1471
01:26:04,727 --> 01:26:06,602
It's not like that Shastri..

1472
01:26:06,602 --> 01:26:08,060
The thing is..

1473
01:26:08,102 --> 01:26:10,310
some people are in the
game but not counted

1474
01:26:10,310 --> 01:26:12,393
You are counted

1475
01:26:12,518 --> 01:26:14,143
but not in the game.

1476
01:26:14,768 --> 01:26:16,977
Sir, Madam is on my side.

1477
01:26:17,018 --> 01:26:18,643
Yes Shastri..

1478
01:26:21,768 --> 01:26:23,560
Sir go back..

1479
01:26:23,852 --> 01:26:25,977
Madam did you just applaud me

1480
01:26:26,018 --> 01:26:27,310
or was it criticism?

1481
01:26:27,352 --> 01:26:28,602
Shastri, it's getting late.

1482
01:26:28,602 --> 01:26:30,143
Go, you have a lot to do.

1483
01:26:31,102 --> 01:26:33,018
I feel, she criticised me.

1484
01:26:35,352 --> 01:26:38,393
Sir I don't know anything
about the taxi driver's murder

1485
01:26:40,352 --> 01:26:42,268
It was raining heavily

1486
01:26:43,018 --> 01:26:46,018
After unloading the shipment,
I was heading home

1487
01:26:46,935 --> 01:26:48,685
Then a guy..

1488
01:26:48,768 --> 01:26:49,935
Sir...

1489
01:26:49,935 --> 01:26:51,685
Sir please stop the truck.

1490
01:26:51,768 --> 01:26:52,810
Sir...

1491
01:26:53,018 --> 01:26:54,018
What happened?

1492
01:26:54,060 --> 01:26:55,893
Sir please drop me
to the next circle

1493
01:26:55,935 --> 01:26:57,560
What happened?
OK hop on.

1494
01:26:57,643 --> 01:26:59,643
Thanks a lot sir.

1495
01:27:00,227 --> 01:27:01,768
Dude, Where are you?

1496
01:27:01,810 --> 01:27:03,602
Did you come to the circle?

1497
01:27:04,352 --> 01:27:06,518
Dude I think I
witnessed a murder

1498
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:08,643
You come fast.
I'll explain everything

1499
01:27:08,643 --> 01:27:10,560
Please come there fast.

1500
01:27:10,602 --> 01:27:12,018
What happened?

1501
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:13,935
Why are you tense?

1502
01:27:13,977 --> 01:27:15,935
Sir, Did you see that
cab parked there?- Yes

1503
01:27:15,935 --> 01:27:18,143
I think someone
was murdered there

1504
01:27:18,143 --> 01:27:20,352
Sir that Killer saw me

1505
01:27:20,435 --> 01:27:22,310
Sir please drop me
bit further

1506
01:27:22,352 --> 01:27:23,310
Please sir...

1507
01:27:23,352 --> 01:27:24,643
Is it...

1508
01:27:24,768 --> 01:27:27,560
Then go lodge a complaint
in the police station

1509
01:27:27,602 --> 01:27:28,893
Yes, I will.

1510
01:27:28,935 --> 01:27:30,227
My friend is on the way

1511
01:27:30,268 --> 01:27:31,768
Just drop me bit further

1512
01:27:31,810 --> 01:27:33,143
Please sir...

1513
01:27:33,143 --> 01:27:34,643
OK. Don't worry.

1514
01:27:34,643 --> 01:27:35,643
I will drop you

1515
01:27:35,643 --> 01:27:37,518
Thanks a lot Sir.

1516
01:27:38,060 --> 01:27:39,643
Can you remember
any other detail?

1517
01:27:39,643 --> 01:27:41,102
Like his name?

1518
01:27:41,143 --> 01:27:43,227
Or whom he was talking to?

1519
01:27:43,268 --> 01:27:45,352
His friend,
his name, anything?

1520
01:27:45,393 --> 01:27:46,268
Try to remember

1521
01:27:46,268 --> 01:27:47,477
Did he say anything

1522
01:27:47,518 --> 01:27:49,060
about his friend?
- No Sir.

1523
01:27:50,102 --> 01:27:52,352
8 years have passed
after that incident

1524
01:27:52,685 --> 01:27:53,768
More than that

1525
01:27:53,810 --> 01:27:56,935
I was unconscious for 3 days
after the accident.

1526
01:27:58,435 --> 01:28:01,518
as I was working under my
employer for many years

1527
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:04,102
Now he has given me a small
job in his outlet

1528
01:28:04,435 --> 01:28:05,143
Oh!

1529
01:28:06,185 --> 01:28:07,102
OK...

1530
01:28:07,935 --> 01:28:09,143
Fine.

1531
01:28:09,310 --> 01:28:10,893
Ok, Thank you Sir.

1532
01:28:11,852 --> 01:28:13,810
Thanks a lot.
- Ok Sir

1533
01:28:18,102 --> 01:28:20,727
Hot tea..
- Thanks Shastri.

1534
01:28:21,060 --> 01:28:22,143
Dude...

1535
01:28:22,227 --> 01:28:24,935
Why did you bring
madam at this time?

1536
01:28:24,977 --> 01:28:27,185
We got an important clue

1537
01:28:27,227 --> 01:28:28,352
That's the reason

1538
01:28:28,352 --> 01:28:30,060
Ok now,
what's the clue?

1539
01:28:30,185 --> 01:28:31,393
Now...

1540
01:28:31,393 --> 01:28:33,643
A guy has witnessed
that murder.

1541
01:28:33,810 --> 01:28:35,560
He has also informed it
to his brother

1542
01:28:35,727 --> 01:28:38,143
Where did he
come from and why?

1543
01:28:38,185 --> 01:28:40,102
Where did he go?
Where is he now?

1544
01:28:40,143 --> 01:28:41,477
We don't know anything

1545
01:28:41,560 --> 01:28:43,185
Now, we have to find him.

1546
01:28:43,268 --> 01:28:45,685
How to find him is the thing.

1547
01:28:45,977 --> 01:28:47,352
God!

1548
01:28:47,393 --> 01:28:49,018
Our situation so bad that

1549
01:28:49,060 --> 01:28:50,393
even if we play Candy Crush,

1550
01:28:50,435 --> 01:28:51,685
we might get Diabetes.

1551
01:28:51,768 --> 01:28:54,143
If we collect info about the
colleges in the vicinity

1552
01:28:54,143 --> 01:28:55,893
We might get some clues?

1553
01:28:56,435 --> 01:28:57,477
Impossible.

1554
01:28:57,643 --> 01:28:59,643
There will be more than
5 thousand students.

1555
01:28:59,685 --> 01:29:02,685
It's impossible to
back track them all

1556
01:29:02,852 --> 01:29:04,893
No way
- I have an idea.

1557
01:29:05,977 --> 01:29:08,560
There is a program in TV
about past life.

1558
01:29:08,602 --> 01:29:10,393
How about we go to killer's

1559
01:29:10,435 --> 01:29:11,685
past life and ask him

1560
01:29:11,727 --> 01:29:12,977
about the murder?

1561
01:29:13,018 --> 01:29:15,268
How about me throwing
this tea on you now?

1562
01:29:15,602 --> 01:29:17,768
My head is like a tower.

1563
01:29:17,810 --> 01:29:19,268
I keep letting out signals

1564
01:29:19,310 --> 01:29:20,893
You just have to catch it.
- What did you say!?

1565
01:29:21,602 --> 01:29:24,393
My head is like a tower
I keep letting signals.

1566
01:29:24,435 --> 01:29:26,518
You just have catch the signal,
that's it.

1567
01:29:27,518 --> 01:29:30,102
Are you thinking about the
same thing that I'm thinking?

1568
01:29:30,102 --> 01:29:32,685
That guys was talking with his
friend on the phone right?

1569
01:29:32,685 --> 01:29:34,685
So, those call records

1570
01:29:34,727 --> 01:29:36,643
will be recorded in
that area tower.

1571
01:29:37,227 --> 01:29:38,727
Shastri..

1572
01:29:39,227 --> 01:29:41,018
I will find the details.

1573
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:45,602
All these are the number
active in those 4 towers

1574
01:29:45,643 --> 01:29:48,185
between 12 to 1PM that night.

1575
01:29:48,935 --> 01:29:49,935
Totally

1576
01:29:50,518 --> 01:29:52,227
518 Numbers

1577
01:29:52,227 --> 01:29:53,852
How do we find it in this?

1578
01:29:53,893 --> 01:29:57,393
What if that guy had the
SIM with a fake ID?

1579
01:29:57,435 --> 01:29:58,393
No way.

1580
01:29:58,435 --> 01:30:01,518
Only a determined killer

1581
01:30:02,018 --> 01:30:04,268
Will get a SIM with a fake ID

1582
01:30:04,310 --> 01:30:06,518
What does a common
man like us do?

1583
01:30:06,518 --> 01:30:08,435
We would have submitted

1584
01:30:08,435 --> 01:30:09,768
our DL or voter ID for the SIM

1585
01:30:09,810 --> 01:30:10,810
So...

1586
01:30:10,810 --> 01:30:13,310
He was just present there

1587
01:30:13,352 --> 01:30:14,727
When the murder occurred

1588
01:30:14,768 --> 01:30:16,143
Then he's a guy.

1589
01:30:16,143 --> 01:30:17,977
Remove all the girls numbers

1590
01:30:18,268 --> 01:30:19,977
Ok 448

1591
01:30:20,268 --> 01:30:21,393
What next?

1592
01:30:21,477 --> 01:30:25,143
How long do you think he
conversed on the phone?

1593
01:30:25,685 --> 01:30:27,893
Between 90-180 seconds

1594
01:30:28,185 --> 01:30:29,810
So let's remove

1595
01:30:29,810 --> 01:30:32,643
All the call records with
more than 180 Seconds

1596
01:30:32,810 --> 01:30:34,518
Now its 298.

1597
01:30:34,727 --> 01:30:36,060
Next?

1598
01:30:36,435 --> 01:30:37,768
You were saying he's a guy.

1599
01:30:37,852 --> 01:30:40,268
Why do you need elders ?

1600
01:30:42,185 --> 01:30:44,643
Ok, How many active numbers?

1601
01:30:44,643 --> 01:30:45,727
16 Numbers

1602
01:30:45,727 --> 01:30:47,310
I phoned all of them,

1603
01:30:47,352 --> 01:30:49,018
nobody knew about the murder.

1604
01:30:49,185 --> 01:30:51,435
Still we have 196 numbers

1605
01:30:51,977 --> 01:30:53,560
While travelling

1606
01:30:53,560 --> 01:30:55,602
It would have passed 2-3 towers

1607
01:30:55,643 --> 01:30:58,852
So lets remove all the
multi tower numbers.

1608
01:30:58,977 --> 01:31:01,185
Still we have 106 numbers

1609
01:31:01,643 --> 01:31:04,685
They will be in nooks and
corners of Karnataka

1610
01:31:04,893 --> 01:31:06,602
Some might have left the city.

1611
01:31:06,727 --> 01:31:08,685
Few would have left the country.

1612
01:31:08,685 --> 01:31:11,393
And some would
have passed away

1613
01:31:11,852 --> 01:31:14,185
We need minimum 3 Months

1614
01:31:14,185 --> 01:31:16,143
to back track them all.

1615
01:31:16,393 --> 01:31:18,060
How do we do that?

1616
01:31:18,102 --> 01:31:20,518
Vishnu had called the police

1617
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:22,102
so remove that.

1618
01:31:22,102 --> 01:31:24,185
Oh! it was too helpful

1619
01:31:24,185 --> 01:31:25,810
still we have 105.

1620
01:31:42,060 --> 01:31:43,018
Sir...

1621
01:31:43,102 --> 01:31:45,893
I heard you guys talking.

1622
01:31:45,893 --> 01:31:48,185
We're talking about
A guy and a murder.

1623
01:31:48,227 --> 01:31:49,518
It's very easy sir.

1624
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:51,143
Next day after the murder

1625
01:31:51,185 --> 01:31:52,935
a number that's switched off

1626
01:31:52,935 --> 01:31:54,268
that's your guy.

1627
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:05,310
Wait a minute,
someone's here

1628
01:32:05,477 --> 01:32:08,268
Sir, are you Amoghavarsha?
- Yes

1629
01:32:08,268 --> 01:32:10,477
I found him,
I'll call you back.

1630
01:32:11,268 --> 01:32:14,268
I want to talk with you.

1631
01:32:18,768 --> 01:32:21,727
Sir, it was around
Midnight 12 - 12:15

1632
01:32:21,977 --> 01:32:23,435
and it was raining heavily..

1633
01:32:23,560 --> 01:32:25,727
I was coming back
after watching a movie

1634
01:32:25,852 --> 01:32:27,935
I thought of buying
liquor before going home

1635
01:32:27,977 --> 01:32:31,560
So I went to the
wine store nearby.

1636
01:32:35,143 --> 01:32:36,893
The wine shop guy

1637
01:32:36,893 --> 01:32:38,393
Was not receiving the call.

1638
01:32:38,727 --> 01:32:41,352
I was just about to leave

1639
01:32:41,393 --> 01:32:42,685
Then...

1640
01:32:42,935 --> 01:32:46,102
I saw a cab
shaking in the road.

1641
01:32:49,018 --> 01:32:51,602
As the road was empty

1642
01:32:51,852 --> 01:32:55,018
I thought a couple was
inside the car.

1643
01:32:55,893 --> 01:32:59,643
So thought of making a video

1644
01:33:00,893 --> 01:33:02,227
Then...

1645
01:33:36,185 --> 01:33:38,102
Hey! Who are you?

1646
01:33:38,435 --> 01:33:39,727
Stop right there

1647
01:34:33,852 --> 01:34:35,893
So, this is the matter

1648
01:34:36,435 --> 01:34:39,518
Now we are getting
clarity about everything

1649
01:34:39,602 --> 01:34:40,560
This is enough

1650
01:34:40,602 --> 01:34:42,268
to prove that guy is innocent

1651
01:34:42,393 --> 01:34:43,435
Sir...

1652
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:44,810
Please...

1653
01:34:44,977 --> 01:34:47,768
Can you repeat everything you
said to me, in the court?

1654
01:34:47,810 --> 01:34:49,893
Sir, why should I fear
to Speak the truth

1655
01:34:49,893 --> 01:34:51,602
Sir, I will say
everything in court.

1656
01:34:51,643 --> 01:34:52,977
Yes!
- Thank you Sir.

1657
01:34:53,227 --> 01:34:55,643
Dude, I'll inform
Jaanu about this

1658
01:34:55,643 --> 01:34:57,227
OK, do it.

1659
01:35:04,185 --> 01:35:06,185
I have a doubt?

1660
01:35:07,227 --> 01:35:10,977
Why did you still keep
that video in your phone?

1661
01:35:12,102 --> 01:35:13,060
Sir..

1662
01:35:13,102 --> 01:35:15,477
I did not keep it
intentionally

1663
01:35:15,768 --> 01:35:17,227
In that phone...

1664
01:35:17,477 --> 01:35:20,602
I had many memories
I couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t erase

1665
01:35:21,227 --> 01:35:23,393
With those pics and videos

1666
01:35:23,518 --> 01:35:25,018
I found this also

1667
01:35:25,018 --> 01:35:26,268
It was your luck.

1668
01:35:50,227 --> 01:35:51,685
Amogha?

1669
01:35:52,643 --> 01:35:53,852
He is..
- it's me.

1670
01:35:55,518 --> 01:35:56,893
A warrant has been
issued on you

1671
01:35:56,935 --> 01:35:58,018
Come, let's go

1672
01:35:58,060 --> 01:35:59,477
Sir..

1673
01:35:59,560 --> 01:36:01,935
Can I know the reason
for his arrest?

1674
01:36:03,560 --> 01:36:05,935
He has cheated
a girl named Deepa

1675
01:36:06,310 --> 01:36:08,018
after promising to marry her

1676
01:36:08,602 --> 01:36:10,018
and he's harassed her too.

1677
01:36:10,227 --> 01:36:12,852
So, I'm taking him to
the station for enquiry

1678
01:36:14,102 --> 01:36:15,310
Sir...

1679
01:36:15,352 --> 01:36:18,352
We had a break-up a year ago

1680
01:36:19,393 --> 01:36:20,977
That was just Break up.

1681
01:36:22,727 --> 01:36:24,393
Complaint was registered now.

1682
01:36:24,435 --> 01:36:25,643
Sir...

1683
01:36:25,727 --> 01:36:28,268
Sir. you are re-opening
a year-old case

1684
01:36:28,268 --> 01:36:30,435
And creating a dispute...

1685
01:36:31,393 --> 01:36:32,727
This is not fair...

1686
01:36:38,227 --> 01:36:41,102
You can open an
eight year old case..

1687
01:36:42,977 --> 01:36:46,810
but shouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t I open
a year old case?

1688
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:49,768
Look.

1689
01:36:50,685 --> 01:36:53,893
Don't think only lawyers
trace the evidence

1690
01:36:55,852 --> 01:36:57,227
Police...

1691
01:36:58,060 --> 01:37:00,643
Even police look for the evidence

1692
01:37:04,393 --> 01:37:05,643
Arrest him.

1693
01:37:05,768 --> 01:37:07,893
Sir I'm not guilty of anything.

1694
01:37:07,893 --> 01:37:09,518
Sir please let me go..

1695
01:37:09,560 --> 01:37:11,393
How did Raghavan get
information about him?

1696
01:37:11,435 --> 01:37:13,393
Sir, I'm innocent
please let me go.

1697
01:37:13,602 --> 01:37:16,185
Sir, I'm innocent.

1698
01:37:16,393 --> 01:37:18,393
He's arresting him now,

1699
01:37:18,435 --> 01:37:20,727
knowing court
hearing is tomorrow.

1700
01:37:20,768 --> 01:37:23,602
Sir, let me go..
Mahesh sir, Help me

1701
01:37:23,602 --> 01:37:24,393
Sir...

1702
01:37:24,477 --> 01:37:27,352
So, he has a
spy on our side.

1703
01:37:28,685 --> 01:37:30,268
Who is it?

1704
01:37:46,852 --> 01:37:48,185
I want to tell you something.

1705
01:37:48,185 --> 01:37:49,518
Hi Mahesh..

1706
01:37:49,643 --> 01:37:51,393
Hello sir..
- Sit down

1707
01:37:52,268 --> 01:37:53,477
How are you?

1708
01:37:54,018 --> 01:37:55,810
Good Sir..

1709
01:37:56,768 --> 01:37:58,768
What were you
thinking about?

1710
01:37:59,185 --> 01:38:00,727
Nothing much.

1711
01:38:02,060 --> 01:38:03,893
I was just thinking
about the case.

1712
01:38:05,893 --> 01:38:08,060
We had just one witness.

1713
01:38:08,685 --> 01:38:11,018
We tracked it with such hardship.

1714
01:38:11,602 --> 01:38:14,810
I can't understand how
police got info about it

1715
01:38:15,643 --> 01:38:17,768
If we had that witness today

1716
01:38:17,768 --> 01:38:20,268
we could have proved
that Vishnu was innocent

1717
01:38:21,018 --> 01:38:22,560
Nowadays..

1718
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:24,560
I feel law and justice

1719
01:38:26,310 --> 01:38:28,143
are two different words.

1720
01:38:31,060 --> 01:38:32,393
With my experience

1721
01:38:34,185 --> 01:38:36,852
as a clue to your case

1722
01:38:37,018 --> 01:38:39,352
so that it might help your case.

1723
01:38:39,852 --> 01:38:40,935
That is

1724
01:38:42,185 --> 01:38:44,018
people close to you..

1725
01:38:44,018 --> 01:38:46,310
will not always stay with you.

1726
01:38:47,018 --> 01:38:48,018
Understood?

1727
01:38:48,310 --> 01:38:49,477
Keep this in mind.

1728
01:38:51,185 --> 01:38:52,602
Good night.

1729
01:39:45,268 --> 01:39:46,518
What is this?

1730
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:47,393
What?

1731
01:39:47,435 --> 01:39:49,727
Don't repeat,
I'm asking, what is this?

1732
01:39:49,727 --> 01:39:51,310
Listen to me.

1733
01:39:51,352 --> 01:39:52,685
What is left to listen?

1734
01:39:52,685 --> 01:39:55,477
I'm struggling day and
night to resolve that case

1735
01:39:55,518 --> 01:39:57,727
How can you even
think of doing this?

1736
01:39:57,768 --> 01:39:58,810
Mahesh Calm down,

1737
01:39:58,810 --> 01:40:00,685
I did this for
our future's sake

1738
01:40:00,727 --> 01:40:01,810
Our sake?

1739
01:40:01,852 --> 01:40:03,435
Ms. Janavi can
you please explain

1740
01:40:03,477 --> 01:40:05,227
What good does it do for us?

1741
01:40:05,268 --> 01:40:07,435
Listen to me completely.

1742
01:40:07,477 --> 01:40:08,643
OK...

1743
01:40:08,768 --> 01:40:10,602
Sit down.

1744
01:40:11,727 --> 01:40:12,810
Tell me.

1745
01:40:12,810 --> 01:40:16,393
He is ready to
fund our new law firm

1746
01:40:16,435 --> 01:40:17,768
only on one condition

1747
01:40:17,810 --> 01:40:19,727
And that is, we have
to drop this case.

1748
01:40:20,060 --> 01:40:21,560
Seriously?

1749
01:40:21,893 --> 01:40:23,643
You did this for that?

1750
01:40:23,727 --> 01:40:25,060
I'm like seriously...

1751
01:40:25,352 --> 01:40:27,602
How can you be so selfish?

1752
01:40:27,643 --> 01:40:28,727
Yes.

1753
01:40:28,727 --> 01:40:30,143
I am selfish.

1754
01:40:30,310 --> 01:40:32,060
Aren't you selfish

1755
01:40:33,185 --> 01:40:34,810
If you win this case,

1756
01:40:34,852 --> 01:40:36,352
you might get famous

1757
01:40:36,435 --> 01:40:37,643
and become a hero,

1758
01:40:37,685 --> 01:40:39,227
Isn't that the reason

1759
01:40:40,018 --> 01:40:41,643
even you are selfish?

1760
01:40:41,810 --> 01:40:43,643
But you don't say it aloud

1761
01:40:44,518 --> 01:40:45,893
Just once.

1762
01:40:46,102 --> 01:40:48,102
Go see your
face in the mirror.

1763
01:40:48,352 --> 01:40:50,893
You'll understand, how
much you have changed.

1764
01:40:52,227 --> 01:40:53,560
It's OK

1765
01:40:53,602 --> 01:40:56,102
Change is inevitable.

1766
01:40:56,435 --> 01:40:58,185
There is nothing
wrong in changing

1767
01:40:58,227 --> 01:41:00,310
when the whole
world is changing.

1768
01:41:00,393 --> 01:41:03,310
What do you get
if you win this case?

1769
01:41:03,310 --> 01:41:04,352
Money?

1770
01:41:05,352 --> 01:41:06,310
No.

1771
01:41:06,310 --> 01:41:07,977
When my father questions

1772
01:41:07,977 --> 01:41:09,893
how will you take
care of my daughter?

1773
01:41:09,935 --> 01:41:11,227
What will you say?

1774
01:41:11,227 --> 01:41:14,018
Will you say
"Uncle we'll manage"

1775
01:41:14,227 --> 01:41:16,477
Ok, I am selfish.

1776
01:41:16,727 --> 01:41:19,685
But, I have thought about
that guy's future also.

1777
01:41:19,685 --> 01:41:21,518
They are also ready to
give him money.

1778
01:41:21,560 --> 01:41:24,643
He can start some
business with that money

1779
01:41:24,685 --> 01:41:28,185
A good lawyer always thinks
about his client first.

1780
01:41:28,227 --> 01:41:29,518
I did the same thing.

1781
01:41:29,518 --> 01:41:31,477
You are thinking too emotionally.

1782
01:41:31,518 --> 01:41:33,518
Think of it practically

1783
01:41:33,685 --> 01:41:34,810
Firstly...

1784
01:41:34,852 --> 01:41:37,060
Who told you that guy
needed financial aid

1785
01:41:37,102 --> 01:41:39,852
Did that guy ever come
to you requesting Money?

1786
01:41:40,185 --> 01:41:42,643
How did you decide
that guy needed money?

1787
01:41:42,685 --> 01:41:45,310
So, according to you...

1788
01:41:45,352 --> 01:41:47,643
money is the solution for everything
- Yes.

1789
01:41:47,685 --> 01:41:50,310
Not just me,
You ask anybody.

1790
01:41:50,352 --> 01:41:51,852
They give you the same answer.

1791
01:41:51,852 --> 01:41:53,727
Now, think that you are
going to a hospital.

1792
01:41:53,768 --> 01:41:54,810
Even there

1793
01:41:54,810 --> 01:41:56,518
only when you
have the money

1794
01:41:56,560 --> 01:41:58,602
doctors treat you.

1795
01:41:58,768 --> 01:41:59,852
If not

1796
01:41:59,852 --> 01:42:01,393
they will ask you to pray to god

1797
01:42:06,643 --> 01:42:08,268
After all this.

1798
01:42:08,768 --> 01:42:11,518
Didn't you ever
feel like asking sorry?

1799
01:42:12,602 --> 01:42:13,685
Actually

1800
01:42:13,685 --> 01:42:15,143
I thought about it.

1801
01:42:15,310 --> 01:42:17,102
But as you said once

1802
01:42:17,185 --> 01:42:20,018
lawyers should never
ask for forgiveness.

1803
01:42:22,185 --> 01:42:23,143
Now

1804
01:42:23,143 --> 01:42:25,685
think of it calmly.

1805
01:42:25,768 --> 01:42:28,518
You'll understand,
why I did this.

1806
01:43:03,560 --> 01:43:04,768
Your honour...

1807
01:43:05,102 --> 01:43:07,727
Before I submit
all the evidence

1808
01:43:07,727 --> 01:43:09,643
I request you to call

1809
01:43:09,685 --> 01:43:12,852
investigating Officer of this
case, Raghavan to the box.

1810
01:43:12,893 --> 01:43:14,352
OK.

1811
01:43:20,352 --> 01:43:23,143
Raghavan, how long have you
worked in the department?

1812
01:43:23,185 --> 01:43:25,435
25 years.

1813
01:43:25,518 --> 01:43:27,143
So can you please explain

1814
01:43:27,143 --> 01:43:29,352
what happened on the
day of murder?

1815
01:43:31,143 --> 01:43:32,393
That day

1816
01:43:32,852 --> 01:43:35,518
around 12:30, we got a call
at the police station

1817
01:43:36,143 --> 01:43:38,602
stating that a murder has been
committed at M.R. circle

1818
01:43:38,602 --> 01:43:39,602
OK.

1819
01:43:39,643 --> 01:43:41,435
When we came to the spot

1820
01:43:41,477 --> 01:43:43,227
a cab driver was murdered

1821
01:43:44,227 --> 01:43:48,268
When we started the
primary investigation

1822
01:43:48,893 --> 01:43:50,518
we suspected him.

1823
01:43:50,518 --> 01:43:52,352
After investigation

1824
01:43:52,477 --> 01:43:55,018
after his bike crashed into the cab

1825
01:43:55,060 --> 01:43:57,768
he had an argument
with the cab driver

1826
01:43:57,768 --> 01:43:59,102
After an heated argument

1827
01:43:59,143 --> 01:44:00,310
he lost his temper.

1828
01:44:00,310 --> 01:44:02,185
Took a knife from his bike

1829
01:44:02,185 --> 01:44:03,935
and stabbed the cab driver.

1830
01:44:03,977 --> 01:44:05,477
Then...

1831
01:44:05,518 --> 01:44:07,602
to stop police from
suspecting him

1832
01:44:07,768 --> 01:44:10,477
he informed about the murder
to the police station

1833
01:44:12,602 --> 01:44:13,643
Raghavan.

1834
01:44:13,852 --> 01:44:16,018
Didn't you find it surprising

1835
01:44:16,018 --> 01:44:19,435
that he committed murder just
because of a small accident?

1836
01:44:21,893 --> 01:44:23,018
Sir

1837
01:44:23,352 --> 01:44:26,185
When a murder is committed

1838
01:44:26,518 --> 01:44:29,560
it is more important to find the
truth than be surprised.

1839
01:44:29,560 --> 01:44:30,768
You are right.

1840
01:44:30,768 --> 01:44:34,018
Finding the truth
is very important

1841
01:44:34,310 --> 01:44:35,477
On the day of the murder

1842
01:44:35,518 --> 01:44:39,393
Vishnu ended the call
with his mother at 12:30

1843
01:44:39,810 --> 01:44:42,518
At 12:31:33

1844
01:44:42,518 --> 01:44:45,685
he called the police to
inform about the murder.

1845
01:44:45,893 --> 01:44:48,227
Your honour my question is

1846
01:44:48,227 --> 01:44:49,560
how can he stop his bike,

1847
01:44:49,560 --> 01:44:51,102
have an argument with driver,

1848
01:44:51,102 --> 01:44:52,685
take the knife from the bike

1849
01:44:52,727 --> 01:44:54,268
and kill the driver
within 90 seconds?

1850
01:44:54,310 --> 01:44:56,185
I object your honour.

1851
01:44:56,185 --> 01:44:57,852
Mr. Mahesh Das

1852
01:44:57,852 --> 01:45:00,727
Is it impossible to kill,
while talking on the phone?

1853
01:45:01,435 --> 01:45:02,935
Call might have not ended.

1854
01:45:02,977 --> 01:45:04,393
Could've placed the call on hold.

1855
01:45:04,435 --> 01:45:06,143
He might be wearing a earphone

1856
01:45:06,185 --> 01:45:10,060
or his mother would've given
instructions to commit murder.

1857
01:45:10,060 --> 01:45:12,143
Anything is possible

1858
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:13,477
your honour.

1859
01:45:13,518 --> 01:45:15,602
How can a normal
primary school teacher

1860
01:45:15,602 --> 01:45:17,768
instruct her son to
commit murder?

1861
01:45:18,518 --> 01:45:22,435
As the law is increasing,
justice is decreasing.

1862
01:45:23,268 --> 01:45:24,143
Your honour,

1863
01:45:24,185 --> 01:45:27,143
I think the young lawyer here
watches a lot of movies.

1864
01:45:27,268 --> 01:45:29,352
That's the reason, he's
Mixing Navarasas

1865
01:45:29,393 --> 01:45:30,893
And getting emotional.

1866
01:45:31,268 --> 01:45:33,518
To re-open any old case

1867
01:45:33,560 --> 01:45:35,727
you need strong evidence

1868
01:45:35,977 --> 01:45:39,185
Just a Phone call not getting
discounted does not become an evidence.

1869
01:45:39,227 --> 01:45:40,977
Even they do not accept it.

1870
01:45:41,018 --> 01:45:43,477
Yes, Mahesh.
He's right.

1871
01:45:43,768 --> 01:45:46,143
Don't you have any
other evidence?

1872
01:45:46,185 --> 01:45:47,352
Answer...

1873
01:45:47,393 --> 01:45:49,602
Madam is asking for the
evidence, do you have any?

1874
01:45:49,602 --> 01:45:50,893
Or will you say,

1875
01:45:50,893 --> 01:45:53,685
I had one and the
cops kidnapped him.

1876
01:45:55,018 --> 01:45:56,560
Your honour,
There is evidence

1877
01:45:56,560 --> 01:45:57,852
But I request the court

1878
01:45:57,893 --> 01:46:00,643
to grant me some
time to present it.

1879
01:46:00,852 --> 01:46:02,477
Mahesh Das

1880
01:46:02,477 --> 01:46:04,893
do you think this is a
village Panchayat?

1881
01:46:05,018 --> 01:46:07,685
to request time as you wish?

1882
01:46:07,727 --> 01:46:08,977
Your honour

1883
01:46:09,018 --> 01:46:11,393
Firstly, this case was not
investigated properly.

1884
01:46:11,435 --> 01:46:13,977
As a result an
innocent was punished.

1885
01:46:14,935 --> 01:46:17,518
And the investigating officer

1886
01:46:17,560 --> 01:46:19,602
has destroyed evidences.

1887
01:46:19,602 --> 01:46:20,560
So...

1888
01:46:20,602 --> 01:46:22,185
if you grant me a chance

1889
01:46:22,227 --> 01:46:23,977
I will prove it to the court.

1890
01:46:28,643 --> 01:46:29,810
Ok. Take your seats

1891
01:46:31,310 --> 01:46:32,477
Yes your honour.

1892
01:46:39,893 --> 01:46:42,518
After inspecting
the evidences

1893
01:46:42,518 --> 01:46:45,185
as this case
has many flaws

1894
01:46:45,185 --> 01:46:50,727
I feel the investigation was
not done in a proper way.

1895
01:46:51,560 --> 01:46:52,685
So

1896
01:46:52,727 --> 01:46:56,227
the court orders for
the suspension of

1897
01:46:56,268 --> 01:46:59,477
investigating officer Raghavan
till the next hearing.

1898
01:46:59,643 --> 01:47:03,018
and to provide proper
evidences to the court.

1899
01:47:03,060 --> 01:47:07,352
Time till the 10th of
next month is granted

1900
01:47:08,518 --> 01:47:11,393
Manjula note it down
- Ok Madam.

1901
01:47:26,643 --> 01:47:28,560
Young boy...

1902
01:47:28,685 --> 01:47:30,518
You are dressed well?

1903
01:47:32,352 --> 01:47:34,685
I am a very good man.

1904
01:47:36,227 --> 01:47:41,310
But I don't know why, you
always awaken my bad side.

1905
01:47:42,643 --> 01:47:44,560
You have an elderly mother.

1906
01:47:45,352 --> 01:47:47,810
Stay with them
in their last days

1907
01:47:48,935 --> 01:47:50,393
not in her memory.

1908
01:47:50,393 --> 01:47:53,018
Madam, talk some sense to him.

1909
01:47:54,185 --> 01:47:56,643
You lost this case
long back.

1910
01:47:57,227 --> 01:48:01,477
Don't dare to make it a mess.

1911
01:48:02,227 --> 01:48:03,768
Listen

1912
01:48:04,602 --> 01:48:08,352
You are safe only till
you are out on parole.

1913
01:48:09,643 --> 01:48:12,393
Once you enter jail...

1914
01:48:13,685 --> 01:48:15,352
Mr. Raghavan

1915
01:48:15,393 --> 01:48:17,518
My dad used to say..

1916
01:48:17,518 --> 01:48:18,643
Son..

1917
01:48:18,727 --> 01:48:21,560
You can change a bad person

1918
01:48:21,727 --> 01:48:25,893
but you can never
change a bad thing.

1919
01:48:26,685 --> 01:48:28,935
Today you lost
just your power.

1920
01:48:28,977 --> 01:48:32,518
You still have a lot to lose.

1921
01:48:32,977 --> 01:48:36,685
Pray to god for blessings

1922
01:48:36,727 --> 01:48:38,352
because

1923
01:48:38,352 --> 01:48:40,185
I will not spare you.

1924
01:48:40,227 --> 01:48:42,810
Sir yesterday you
taught him a lesson

1925
01:48:42,852 --> 01:48:44,893
He somehow missed it

1926
01:48:47,685 --> 01:48:48,893
Look

1927
01:48:48,935 --> 01:48:51,477
If a teacher, police
or a thief hits you

1928
01:48:51,477 --> 01:48:53,185
you can hear a sound.

1929
01:48:53,185 --> 01:48:56,352
If a lawyer or god hits you

1930
01:48:56,393 --> 01:48:57,935
you can't hear anything.

1931
01:48:57,935 --> 01:49:00,268
But you cannot bear that pain

1932
01:49:00,310 --> 01:49:02,227
Your Boss knows
pretty well about it.

1933
01:49:02,227 --> 01:49:04,768
As time passes even
you will understand

1934
01:49:04,768 --> 01:49:06,018
What did you say?

1935
01:49:06,018 --> 01:49:09,352
Police traces the evidence

1936
01:49:09,435 --> 01:49:13,102
Lawyer I trace opportunity

1937
01:49:14,060 --> 01:49:15,852
Let's go.

1938
01:50:43,852 --> 01:50:46,643
Suri booked a cab

1939
01:50:46,852 --> 01:50:51,102
Then he stabbed the cab
driver robbed him

1940
01:50:51,143 --> 01:50:52,477
and ran away

1941
01:50:55,102 --> 01:50:59,518
Amogha, records a video
of it in his mobile

1942
01:50:59,768 --> 01:51:02,893
Suri catches Amogha
recording the video.

1943
01:51:07,477 --> 01:51:11,102
Then Suri chases Amogha.

1944
01:51:14,518 --> 01:51:17,185
Amogha takes a ride

1945
01:51:17,227 --> 01:51:19,143
from a truck passing by.

1946
01:51:19,310 --> 01:51:21,393
When Suri was returning

1947
01:51:21,435 --> 01:51:23,643
Vishnu's bike comes
opposite to him.

1948
01:51:23,643 --> 01:51:25,518
Vishnu falls down.

1949
01:51:25,518 --> 01:51:28,227
But Suri escapes from there.

1950
01:51:29,435 --> 01:51:31,560
Oh! Something is missing

1951
01:51:32,768 --> 01:51:35,977
Dude, I heard you had an
argument in the office

1952
01:51:36,018 --> 01:51:38,768
Why did you call?

1953
01:51:39,102 --> 01:51:40,935
I knew this would happen.

1954
01:51:40,977 --> 01:51:42,560
That's why I did not
give you the video

1955
01:51:42,560 --> 01:51:43,310
Which video?

1956
01:51:43,352 --> 01:51:44,935
Amogha's mobile recording

1957
01:51:44,935 --> 01:51:49,435
I had a copy of the
video he recorded

1958
01:51:49,435 --> 01:51:51,310
I have mailed it to you

1959
01:51:51,352 --> 01:51:53,018
If you had given it to me before

1960
01:51:53,060 --> 01:51:54,602
we would have submitted
it as evidence.

1961
01:51:54,643 --> 01:51:57,935
Oh! So that your love
gives it to Parthasarathy?

1962
01:51:57,977 --> 01:52:00,227
I knew what was happening

1963
01:52:00,227 --> 01:52:01,643
I kept a copy for
safekeeping

1964
01:52:01,685 --> 01:52:03,102
Watch it - OK

1965
01:52:03,143 --> 01:52:04,685
Wait, I will check.

1966
01:52:24,810 --> 01:52:27,893
Suri is not in the video?

1967
01:52:28,352 --> 01:52:29,893
Someone else is here.

1968
01:52:31,060 --> 01:52:34,893
I stabbed him
while I was high

1969
01:52:35,393 --> 01:52:37,185
and ran from there

1970
01:52:37,352 --> 01:52:41,060
So after Suri stabbed him and ran away

1971
01:52:41,560 --> 01:52:44,060
someone else came in a bike.

1972
01:52:44,810 --> 01:52:46,768
Sir, I'm sure about one thing.

1973
01:52:46,810 --> 01:52:51,018
I did not stab that cab
driver to death.

1974
01:52:51,310 --> 01:52:55,518
So it was not Suri, who
stabbed the cab driver.

1975
01:52:55,560 --> 01:52:57,268
It was the guy on the bike.

1976
01:52:57,310 --> 01:52:58,935
Who was that guy on the bike?

1977
01:53:03,518 --> 01:53:06,143
He was the one who chased Amogha.

1978
01:53:06,185 --> 01:53:09,310
and also the guy Vishnu saw.

1979
01:53:16,852 --> 01:53:17,935
So...

1980
01:53:18,143 --> 01:53:21,768
Suri stabbed
the cab driver

1981
01:53:22,185 --> 01:53:24,810
robbed him and ran away.

1982
01:53:24,977 --> 01:53:27,810
Then another guy came there

1983
01:53:28,060 --> 01:53:30,185
Amoghavarsha saw that guy

1984
01:53:30,977 --> 01:53:33,893
He chased Amoghavarsha but...

1985
01:53:33,893 --> 01:53:36,060
Amoghavarsha escaped.

1986
01:53:36,102 --> 01:53:39,977
Took a ride in a
truck and escaped.

1987
01:53:40,893 --> 01:53:43,602
While he was coming back

1988
01:53:43,643 --> 01:53:47,060
Vishnu's bike came there
and Vishnu fell down.

1989
01:53:48,852 --> 01:53:51,560
Who could that bike owner be?

1990
01:53:51,602 --> 01:53:53,018
Sir.. he
- Done

1991
01:53:53,018 --> 01:53:54,518
Did you find the bike details?

1992
01:53:54,560 --> 01:53:57,602
I showed this video
to all my co-workers

1993
01:53:57,602 --> 01:53:58,977
number plate is not visible,

1994
01:53:58,977 --> 01:54:00,435
else I would have
given all the details

1995
01:54:00,477 --> 01:54:02,143
Thanks a lot sir, we'll...

1996
01:54:02,143 --> 01:54:05,518
Why are you repeating the
things we already knew

1997
01:54:05,810 --> 01:54:08,977
Why would I come here
if we knew the number.

1998
01:54:09,227 --> 01:54:11,185
Any other detail?

1999
01:54:11,602 --> 01:54:13,060
Thing is...

2000
01:54:13,435 --> 01:54:16,310
This is a Machismo model

2001
01:54:16,310 --> 01:54:19,727
Only 150 bikes were
sold in this edition.

2002
01:54:20,477 --> 01:54:23,143
This is part of it.
- Thanks a lot.

2003
01:54:23,185 --> 01:54:27,227
What do I do with the details of
the bike being limited edition?

2004
01:54:27,268 --> 01:54:29,310
Say something that
is very important

2005
01:54:29,310 --> 01:54:31,810
Ok, so it's a limited edition bike

2006
01:54:34,977 --> 01:54:38,060
Can you get the details
of the bike's owner?

2007
01:54:42,352 --> 01:54:44,018
We can do one thing.

2008
01:54:44,018 --> 01:54:46,810
Now, We know only
150 bikes were sold - Yes

2009
01:54:46,852 --> 01:54:49,227
And this is a limited edition bike

2010
01:54:52,185 --> 01:54:54,477
What I will do is...

2011
01:54:54,477 --> 01:54:56,227
I will take the risk and

2012
01:54:56,518 --> 01:54:59,560
send you the details
of all those 150 bike owners

2013
01:54:59,602 --> 01:55:01,560
if you can do something

2014
01:55:01,602 --> 01:55:03,977
it's a very long process

2015
01:55:03,977 --> 01:55:05,893
to find that guy with it

2016
01:55:06,060 --> 01:55:08,393
It's impossible,
- Sir...

2017
01:55:08,935 --> 01:55:11,518
Sir it's very easy to find
- I will find the guy

2018
01:55:11,560 --> 01:55:13,185
How?
-Sir...

2019
01:55:13,435 --> 01:55:15,477
518
- Mobiles

2020
01:55:15,518 --> 01:55:17,477
Towers
- Call list.

2021
01:55:18,935 --> 01:55:20,352
Sir see clearly

2022
01:55:20,352 --> 01:55:23,018
As he is coming out of the car

2023
01:55:23,227 --> 01:55:25,560
He is talking to
someone on the mobile

2024
01:55:25,727 --> 01:55:27,852
If we tally that details

2025
01:55:27,852 --> 01:55:30,685
with the address he gives us

2026
01:55:32,060 --> 01:55:34,393
If it matches

2027
01:55:35,518 --> 01:55:37,560
he is the bike owner

2028
01:55:37,602 --> 01:55:38,852
Get me an orange juice

2029
01:55:38,893 --> 01:55:42,060
This time around even
I have solved it

2030
01:55:42,268 --> 01:55:43,893
Dude, You have a bright future.

2031
01:55:43,893 --> 01:55:45,893
How much does that bike cost?

2032
01:55:47,685 --> 01:55:49,352
We wanted to meet
Narayanappa.

2033
01:55:49,352 --> 01:55:51,685
My dad is Narayanappa.

2034
01:55:51,727 --> 01:55:53,643
Yeah, we came here
to meet him.

2035
01:55:54,393 --> 01:55:56,477
It's been 2 months
since he died.

2036
01:55:56,477 --> 01:55:57,852
Careful

2037
01:55:58,727 --> 01:56:00,810
Sir, How did he die?

2038
01:56:00,852 --> 01:56:02,685
Heart attack sir

2039
01:56:02,893 --> 01:56:05,852
Is he Narayanappa?

2040
01:56:05,893 --> 01:56:07,977
Yes sir, that is
my father's Photo.

2041
01:56:07,977 --> 01:56:10,102
Dude, Police...
- How can I help you?

2042
01:56:10,268 --> 01:56:12,268
Sir, actually
We are from LIC

2043
01:56:12,310 --> 01:56:14,227
A policy in his name
has matured

2044
01:56:14,352 --> 01:56:15,852
Can you please confirm

2045
01:56:15,893 --> 01:56:17,393
his mobile number

2046
01:56:17,435 --> 01:56:18,435
Sure.

2047
01:56:18,435 --> 01:56:20,477
9845161213

2048
01:56:20,518 --> 01:56:22,685
No sir, my dad's number was...

2049
01:56:22,727 --> 01:56:25,018
9739121490

2050
01:56:25,268 --> 01:56:27,143
490...

2051
01:56:28,143 --> 01:56:32,018
Then i am very sorry sir,
We are in the wrong address.

2052
01:56:32,060 --> 01:56:34,643
Does any other Narayanappa
reside in the neighbourhood?

2053
01:56:34,685 --> 01:56:36,227
None that I know of.

2054
01:56:36,268 --> 01:56:37,727
Nobody
- No sir...

2055
01:56:37,768 --> 01:56:40,185
Actually the Narayanappa
we are searching

2056
01:56:40,227 --> 01:56:41,393
is still alive.

2057
01:56:41,393 --> 01:56:43,227
Oh!
- And he's a...

2058
01:56:43,227 --> 01:56:44,727
civil contractor

2059
01:56:44,727 --> 01:56:47,852
Sorry for the disturbing you
- No worries

2060
01:56:47,852 --> 01:56:49,768
Thank you so much Sir.

2061
01:56:49,810 --> 01:56:51,018
Ok..

2062
01:57:04,435 --> 01:57:05,310
Dude...

2063
01:57:05,352 --> 01:57:08,935
I found all the details you
asked me on the number

2064
01:57:09,143 --> 01:57:10,768
March 10, 2010.

2065
01:57:10,768 --> 01:57:13,018
Between 12-12:30 AM

2066
01:57:13,060 --> 01:57:14,727
This number has

2067
01:57:14,768 --> 01:57:17,435
3 incoming and 3 outgoing
calls, to the same number.

2068
01:57:17,977 --> 01:57:19,477
Did you find the number details?

2069
01:57:19,477 --> 01:57:21,352
I found the number but,
could not find details

2070
01:57:21,393 --> 01:57:23,560
Access is denied
- Why!?

2071
01:57:23,685 --> 01:57:24,768
Access Denied?

2072
01:57:24,810 --> 01:57:27,768
According to me,
it is some VIP's number

2073
01:57:28,143 --> 01:57:29,852
VIP number...

2074
01:57:30,685 --> 01:57:31,935
Give me that number..

2075
01:57:31,977 --> 01:57:34,602
It has all the details,
see if it helps you

2076
01:57:38,477 --> 01:57:39,727
Hello..

2077
01:57:40,518 --> 01:57:41,685
What!....

2078
01:57:42,518 --> 01:57:43,977
Vishnu...

2079
01:57:50,893 --> 01:57:53,435
Sir, Please let me go.

2080
01:57:53,560 --> 01:57:55,935
I haven't done anything.

2081
01:57:55,977 --> 01:57:59,435
No Sir, I did not
do anything wrong.

2082
01:58:00,893 --> 01:58:03,102
Just say the truth...

2083
01:58:20,018 --> 01:58:21,977
I told him everything...

2084
01:59:09,227 --> 01:59:10,935
Guru, Go check what it is.

2085
01:59:11,060 --> 01:59:12,185
Yes Sir.

2086
01:59:23,143 --> 01:59:25,185
How dare you hit us..

2087
01:59:27,310 --> 01:59:28,352
Police...

2088
01:59:38,810 --> 01:59:40,560
Sir, Where is he?

2089
01:59:40,768 --> 01:59:41,977
Inside.

2090
01:59:42,852 --> 01:59:44,352
Sir, go fast.

2091
02:00:06,310 --> 02:00:08,477
My fault was letting you alive

2092
02:00:08,643 --> 02:00:09,685
Get up...

2093
02:00:17,060 --> 02:00:18,102
What are you doing?

2094
02:00:18,143 --> 02:00:20,518
in here sir...

2095
02:00:21,227 --> 02:00:23,310
Sir, Please don't stop me.
I will kill him.

2096
02:00:23,352 --> 02:00:25,060
Leave me
- Why..

2097
02:00:26,393 --> 02:00:28,518
Why, kill him?

2098
02:00:28,768 --> 02:00:30,643
Before you kill him

2099
02:00:30,685 --> 02:00:32,143
Kill Me

2100
02:00:33,102 --> 02:00:34,935
You should kill me

2101
02:00:35,518 --> 02:00:36,977
Do You know why?

2102
02:00:37,477 --> 02:00:41,268
Because I brought an innocent
guy to this situation

2103
02:00:42,352 --> 02:00:44,268
For making an innocent guy

2104
02:00:44,268 --> 02:00:46,185
ready to murder someone

2105
02:00:46,477 --> 02:00:47,685
For that...

2106
02:00:47,977 --> 02:00:49,435
Before you kill him...

2107
02:00:49,477 --> 02:00:51,435
Kill me,
Come on, stab...

2108
02:00:53,768 --> 02:00:55,185
You can't, right?

2109
02:00:56,268 --> 02:00:57,893
You can't stab,
right.

2110
02:00:59,143 --> 02:01:00,393
Do You know why?

2111
02:01:02,435 --> 02:01:03,727
Because..

2112
02:01:04,643 --> 02:01:07,060
You are not a murderer.

2113
02:01:09,352 --> 02:01:11,227
You are exonerated.

2114
02:02:01,143 --> 02:02:02,560
What is the matter?

2115
02:02:09,102 --> 02:02:11,352
I thought about it a lot.

2116
02:02:12,602 --> 02:02:14,435
After you left.

2117
02:02:14,477 --> 02:02:17,102
Did I do the
right thing or

2118
02:02:17,185 --> 02:02:19,393
what you did was right.

2119
02:02:20,477 --> 02:02:24,768
I couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t find any answer

2120
02:02:25,977 --> 02:02:27,602
I had a dream

2121
02:02:27,727 --> 02:02:31,435
to own a bungalow, car

2122
02:02:31,477 --> 02:02:34,518
and lot of money to
travel the world

2123
02:02:34,977 --> 02:02:37,143
There is nothing wrong in it right?

2124
02:02:39,602 --> 02:02:43,227
You were so submerged
in courts and cases

2125
02:02:45,643 --> 02:02:47,560
You never remembered me.

2126
02:02:48,435 --> 02:02:51,935
I was so busy chasing
status and money.

2127
02:02:54,643 --> 02:02:56,727
but I could not forget you.

2128
02:03:00,935 --> 02:03:03,060
I'm sorry.

2129
02:03:24,352 --> 02:03:26,810
I knew you'd come back.

2130
02:03:26,893 --> 02:03:28,018
How?

2131
02:03:28,518 --> 02:03:30,143
How?...

2132
02:03:30,185 --> 02:03:32,185
According to Article 26

2133
02:03:32,227 --> 02:03:35,768
leaking an evidence
to the third party...

2134
02:03:36,435 --> 02:03:39,143
Please.. do you want
to do this now?

2135
02:03:39,685 --> 02:03:42,560
Yes, now I want you
to be with me.

2136
02:03:44,352 --> 02:03:46,560
It's OK. It happens.

2137
02:03:47,143 --> 02:03:48,727
Come let's go.

2138
02:03:55,393 --> 02:03:58,477
Now we have that murderer's number.

2139
02:03:58,518 --> 02:04:00,143
When he receives the call

2140
02:04:00,143 --> 02:04:02,185
say what we taught you.

2141
02:04:02,268 --> 02:04:03,977
Hello...

2142
02:04:03,977 --> 02:04:05,810

2143
02:04:05,977 --> 02:04:07,977
Midnight 12:30

2144
02:04:08,685 --> 02:04:11,102
Cab driver's murder.

2145
02:04:11,268 --> 02:04:13,143
Constable Narayanappa

2146
02:04:13,268 --> 02:04:16,518
The evidence you need is with me.

2147
02:04:17,935 --> 02:04:19,227
Tomorrow

2148
02:04:19,227 --> 02:04:22,685

02:04:27,143 --> 02:04:28,893
Or else...

2151
02:04:29,102 --> 02:04:31,435
Sorry wrong number.

2152
02:04:31,477 --> 02:04:33,643
Hello, Hello

2153
02:04:33,685 --> 02:04:36,185
He said wrong number
and ended the call!

2154
02:04:36,852 --> 02:04:38,727
What do we do now?

2155
02:04:39,935 --> 02:04:42,185
Jaanu
- Confirm, he's the guy

2156
02:04:42,477 --> 02:04:43,602
Do you think he'll come?

2157
02:04:43,643 --> 02:04:44,935
He will come for sure.

2158
02:04:44,977 --> 02:04:48,143
But Sir, he said
it's the wrong number.

2159
02:04:48,560 --> 02:04:51,060
What if he's not the guy?

2160
02:04:51,060 --> 02:04:54,768
He ended the call only after
getting the necessary info.

2161
02:04:54,935 --> 02:04:57,352
Yes, or else...

2162
02:04:58,602 --> 02:05:01,393
He should have ended the call

2163
02:05:01,435 --> 02:05:03,477
as soon as he received it.

2164
02:05:03,477 --> 02:05:04,685
Exactly.

2165
02:05:04,810 --> 02:05:06,893
Sir but...

2166
02:05:06,893 --> 02:05:08,518
What if instead of him,

2167
02:05:08,518 --> 02:05:10,352
someone else comes there?

2168
02:05:10,352 --> 02:05:13,060
When he can arrange one
crore in a single day

2169
02:05:13,102 --> 02:05:14,852
what if he sends ten people?

2170
02:05:14,893 --> 02:05:16,602
What can we possibly do?

2171
02:05:16,643 --> 02:05:19,310
What he's saying is right.

2172
02:05:20,102 --> 02:05:24,393
Look, all these days you
were thinking like a lawyer

2173
02:05:24,518 --> 02:05:29,268
This time think like a criminal.

2174
02:05:39,435 --> 02:05:41,560
OK guys..

2175
02:05:41,602 --> 02:05:45,018
Today I've talked to the police
commissioner about this case.

2176
02:05:45,060 --> 02:05:48,977
Since Raghavan and his team is
directly involved in this case

2177
02:05:49,018 --> 02:05:51,727
commissioner has sent a
team to help us.

2178
02:05:51,727 --> 02:05:54,435
The plan is...

2179
02:07:31,102 --> 02:07:32,977
Memory card?

2180
02:07:37,685 --> 02:07:38,977
Cash.

2181
02:09:19,768 --> 02:09:21,643
Oh shit...

2182
02:09:24,977 --> 02:09:28,685
You take him,
to a safer place

2183
02:09:28,852 --> 02:09:30,727
C'mon guys..

2184
02:09:31,852 --> 02:09:35,143
Activate the GPS tracker in
the box and check where it is...

2185
02:09:35,185 --> 02:09:37,102
Sir, it's outside the bus stop.

2186
02:09:37,143 --> 02:09:39,893
Team one, come out of
the Majestic bus stop.

2187
02:09:39,935 --> 02:09:41,810
Sir, now its in
Gandhinagar 1st main

2188
02:09:41,810 --> 02:09:43,810
Its near Gandhinagar 1st main

2189
02:09:43,810 --> 02:09:45,560
Team 1 shift there.

2190
02:09:45,602 --> 02:09:47,393
Make it fast.
- Sir we have a movement

2191
02:09:47,435 --> 02:09:49,977
Don't stop tracking
- He's heading towards 2nd main

2192
02:09:50,018 --> 02:09:52,518
Team two,
go to 2nd main

2193
02:10:07,602 --> 02:10:09,435
Sir, I have collected it.

2194
02:10:50,935 --> 02:10:53,143
Don't move.

2195
02:10:56,852 --> 02:10:57,935
One minute..

2196
02:10:58,268 --> 02:10:59,935
Where is the suitcase?

2197
02:11:06,393 --> 02:11:07,435
Sir...

2198
02:11:08,268 --> 02:11:09,852
Look there...

2199
02:12:30,643 --> 02:12:32,893
Sir, We lost the signal...

2200
02:12:33,102 --> 02:12:34,935
Shit!

2201
02:12:35,977 --> 02:12:37,768
What do we do now?

2202
02:12:43,268 --> 02:12:46,435
If a tiger takes 2 steps back

2203
02:12:46,435 --> 02:12:49,477
It means, it is ready to hunt.

2204
02:12:49,477 --> 02:12:51,435
He might be good

2205
02:12:51,435 --> 02:12:54,518
but not the best.

2206
02:13:39,685 --> 02:13:42,102
Welcome Mahesh..

2207
02:13:42,352 --> 02:13:46,102
Your smile is says everything

2208
02:13:46,143 --> 02:13:49,935
about you winning this case already.

2209
02:13:50,143 --> 02:13:51,935
Do you know something?

2210
02:13:52,268 --> 02:13:56,352
You should never step out

2211
02:13:56,727 --> 02:14:00,185
to cut a huge tree
with a small knife

2212
02:14:00,643 --> 02:14:04,018
You still a chance,
think about it.

2213
02:14:04,185 --> 02:14:07,393
Will you die like
a king waging war?

2214
02:14:07,393 --> 02:14:08,810
Or

2215
02:14:08,852 --> 02:14:11,018
will you compromise with me

2216
02:14:11,060 --> 02:14:13,143
and lead a happy life.

2217
02:14:13,143 --> 02:14:14,435
The decision is yours

2218
02:14:15,102 --> 02:14:16,102
Sir.

2219
02:14:16,143 --> 02:14:20,060
Waging war at a time when striking a
compromise is a better option.

2220
02:14:20,102 --> 02:14:24,602
Its as bad as compromising in a situation
where a war needs to be declared.

2221
02:14:24,852 --> 02:14:27,352
Just asking for the
sake of curiosity

2222
02:14:27,352 --> 02:14:29,935
just with a single photo

2223
02:14:29,977 --> 02:14:34,102
how will you prove that
I was behind all this?

2224
02:14:35,185 --> 02:14:37,310
Not just the Photo.

2225
02:14:37,352 --> 02:14:39,143
I have other evidence.

2226
02:14:42,102 --> 02:14:45,893
The Memory card you were searching.

2227
02:14:48,727 --> 02:14:50,685
Are you ready?

2228
02:14:50,852 --> 02:14:53,310
What are you thinking about?

2229
02:14:56,435 --> 02:15:00,185
I never thought this day
Would come in my life.

2230
02:15:02,518 --> 02:15:04,518
Sir, we'll win this right?

2231
02:15:05,893 --> 02:15:08,352
I'm not sure
whether we'll win this.

2232
02:15:08,352 --> 02:15:10,602
but we'll not lose it for sure.

2233
02:15:10,852 --> 02:15:12,060
Don't worry.

2234
02:15:12,060 --> 02:15:14,727
Sir, you had to face so many
hardships because of me.

2235
02:15:15,643 --> 02:15:17,060
I am sorry Sir.

2236
02:15:17,810 --> 02:15:19,310
Look...

2237
02:15:19,602 --> 02:15:22,810
A fight never arises between
good and bad people.

2238
02:15:22,935 --> 02:15:26,227
Fights arise between good and evil.

2239
02:15:29,185 --> 02:15:31,185
Sir, I have a
request and a doubt

2240
02:15:31,227 --> 02:15:32,810
Tell me
- Request is...

2241
02:15:32,852 --> 02:15:34,060
After this case is finished

2242
02:15:34,102 --> 02:15:36,060
I want to meet the
cab drivers family.

2243
02:15:36,102 --> 02:15:38,143
They think I am the murderer.

2244
02:15:38,143 --> 02:15:40,352
I want to tell them the truth.

2245
02:15:40,352 --> 02:15:42,060
And your doubt is?

2246
02:15:47,018 --> 02:15:49,935
How did you find
that Memory card?

2247
02:15:50,727 --> 02:15:51,852
You see...

2248
02:15:52,602 --> 02:15:56,268
You can't find answers to
some questions in life

2249
02:15:56,352 --> 02:15:57,643
but...

2250
02:15:58,102 --> 02:16:01,477
the answer to both
your questions is

2251
02:16:22,643 --> 02:16:25,935
Hello, Dad, what's happening...

2252
02:16:25,935 --> 02:16:28,560
Hello, Please Dad...

2253
02:16:28,602 --> 02:16:31,018
Dad please talk to me

2254
02:16:31,018 --> 02:16:33,977
Hello, Dad...

2255
02:16:34,018 --> 02:16:37,143
Hello dad, where are you?
Please talk to me..

2256
02:16:37,143 --> 02:16:39,685
Hello Dad...

2257
02:16:39,810 --> 02:16:41,727
I knew from the beginning

2258
02:16:41,852 --> 02:16:44,935
You did not kill my Dad.

2259
02:16:45,143 --> 02:16:46,268
But...

2260
02:16:46,310 --> 02:16:48,893
I was not in a situation
to doing anything.

2261
02:16:49,393 --> 02:16:51,060
I had to wait for 8 long years.

2262
02:16:51,102 --> 02:16:53,060
8 long years.

2263
02:16:53,310 --> 02:16:54,977
Then...

2264
02:16:54,977 --> 02:16:57,977
Me and my friend
made a plan.

2265
02:16:58,227 --> 02:17:01,602
Why shouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t we reopen
this case ourselves?

2266
02:17:01,643 --> 02:17:03,185
Impossible
- Why?

2267
02:17:03,227 --> 02:17:05,102
It's an 8 year old case.

2268
02:17:05,143 --> 02:17:07,893
We need money and manpower.

2269
02:17:09,018 --> 02:17:11,518
I have a plan for that.

2270
02:17:11,852 --> 02:17:13,727
What is it?

2271
02:17:13,977 --> 02:17:15,435
Hegde Associates.

2272
02:17:15,477 --> 02:17:18,352
Tomorrow there's an
interview in your firm.

2273
02:17:18,393 --> 02:17:21,102
First let's see who'll get selected.

2274
02:17:21,102 --> 02:17:22,435
Then we'll decide.

2275
02:17:22,435 --> 02:17:23,685
Mahesh Das.

2276
02:17:23,727 --> 02:17:26,477
He is Shastri, case in charge.

2277
02:17:26,477 --> 02:17:29,977
They are planning to
start a free legal service.

2278
02:17:30,435 --> 02:17:34,560
Our firm is planning to
start a free legal service.

2279
02:17:34,560 --> 02:17:37,810
To re-open any old case

2280
02:17:38,893 --> 02:17:41,227
we have to file a new case

2281
02:17:41,268 --> 02:17:44,143
To state it simply,
'Compensation Case'

2282
02:17:44,185 --> 02:17:45,727
What do you think we should do?

2283
02:17:45,727 --> 02:17:48,977
Rather than fighting
this compensation case,

2284
02:17:49,018 --> 02:17:50,602
lets re-open the original case.

2285
02:17:50,643 --> 02:17:53,268
Stating our client did
not commit the murder.

2286
02:17:53,268 --> 02:17:56,435
Then this compensation
case will be nullified.

2287
02:17:56,477 --> 02:17:57,935
But unfortunately,

2288
02:17:57,977 --> 02:18:00,852
I had no information about
that memory card.

2289
02:18:00,893 --> 02:18:04,518
But he let the secret
out in Majestic

2290
02:18:04,560 --> 02:18:05,935
Memory card?

2291
02:18:06,560 --> 02:18:09,393
Then I remembered the
words my Dad said.

2292
02:18:09,393 --> 02:18:12,352
I am not saying
this as a father.

2293
02:18:12,518 --> 02:18:14,352
Being police informer,

2294
02:18:14,393 --> 02:18:17,018
I'm saying this to a
lawyer aspirant

2295
02:18:17,060 --> 02:18:20,602
We should always keep
our secret stuff

2296
02:18:21,102 --> 02:18:24,060
as close as possible to us

2297
02:18:31,227 --> 02:18:34,852
Law says It's OK even if 100
criminals don't get punished.

2298
02:18:34,893 --> 02:18:38,143
But not a single
innocent should be punished.

2299
02:18:38,185 --> 02:18:42,727
But no there is no info on what to
do when an innocent is punished.

2300
02:18:42,768 --> 02:18:46,518
With the curiosity
of what the law does

2301
02:18:46,518 --> 02:18:50,352
I bring you the first
convict of this case.

2302
02:18:50,560 --> 02:18:52,935
Retired police officer

2303
02:18:52,977 --> 02:18:55,143
Vajramuni.

2304
02:18:57,102 --> 02:19:00,268
All his illegal activities

2305
02:19:00,310 --> 02:19:02,060
were recorded in a video.

2306
02:19:02,060 --> 02:19:04,060
Nobody should get the info...

2307
02:19:04,102 --> 02:19:06,143
This body was encountered.

2308
02:19:06,393 --> 02:19:08,060
If you burn it normally

2309
02:19:08,060 --> 02:19:10,727
it will become a political issue.
and create public nuisance.

2310
02:19:10,727 --> 02:19:13,643
Nobody will know if it's
here in the cemetery.

2311
02:19:14,227 --> 02:19:15,727
Burn it.

2312
02:19:15,727 --> 02:19:18,518
Sir, How can I burn it?

2313
02:19:22,018 --> 02:19:23,768
What if Sir finds out?

2314
02:19:23,810 --> 02:19:25,268
He himself ordered this.

2315
02:19:25,268 --> 02:19:26,852
He's inside.

2316
02:19:26,893 --> 02:19:28,518
Sir, I'm scared.

2317
02:19:28,560 --> 02:19:30,310
What if I'm blamed for it.

2318
02:19:30,310 --> 02:19:32,185
We'll take care.

2319
02:19:32,185 --> 02:19:34,393
You finish your job.

2320
02:19:35,727 --> 02:19:38,935
After taking bribes from
politicians and businessmen

2321
02:19:38,977 --> 02:19:42,018
killing their enemies in
the name of encounters.

2322
02:19:42,060 --> 02:19:44,810
And then burning the body
in the cemeteries.

2323
02:19:44,852 --> 02:19:48,018
To the outside world,
you projected them as missing.

2324
02:19:48,060 --> 02:19:51,977
That cemetery guy made a
video about this scam.

2325
02:19:52,018 --> 02:19:55,310
And informed police informer,
and also my Dad Ram Das.

2326
02:19:55,352 --> 02:19:59,102
Constable Narayanappa
followed my Dad.

2327
02:19:59,268 --> 02:20:03,643
But by then, Suri Stabs my Dad,
and runs away after robbing him.

2328
02:20:03,685 --> 02:20:06,727
Just because he saw the video

2329
02:20:06,768 --> 02:20:10,268
on your orders,
constable Narayanappa

2330
02:20:10,310 --> 02:20:13,435
killed My Dad,
who was still alive.

2331
02:20:13,935 --> 02:20:15,852
But after 9 Months,

2332
02:20:15,893 --> 02:20:18,852
a call is made to the
station regarding the case.

2333
02:20:19,060 --> 02:20:23,310
Just because you were worried
about that memory card

2334
02:20:23,310 --> 02:20:26,643
with special interest
you re-opened the case.

2335
02:20:26,643 --> 02:20:28,435
To divert us.

2336
02:20:28,435 --> 02:20:31,935
You gave information
about Suri to Vishnu.

2337
02:20:32,518 --> 02:20:35,768
But the wrong thing
you did was...

2338
02:20:35,810 --> 02:20:39,477
Believing we had the memory card.

2339
02:20:41,393 --> 02:20:44,227
My Dad used to say

2340
02:20:44,602 --> 02:20:48,435
a Mighty guy wins
only till he's strong.

2341
02:20:48,477 --> 02:20:52,060
But an intelligent can always win.

2342
02:20:52,602 --> 02:20:55,852
That's the reason,
He named me Mahesh Das.

2343
02:20:55,893 --> 02:20:59,143
Because many years ago

2344
02:20:59,185 --> 02:21:02,602
A Man called Mahesh Das
believed in these words.

2345
02:21:02,643 --> 02:21:06,977
With love People called
Mahesh Das as...

2346
02:21:07,185 --> 02:21:09,352
BIRBAL.
