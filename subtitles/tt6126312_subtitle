1
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:49,950
Yes!

2
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,800
You want to be the head.

3
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,000
And so does your brother.

4
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,460
One of you has to go.
Hmmm confusing.

5
00:03:25,304 --> 00:03:27,144
If it's heads then your brother dies.

6
00:03:27,417 --> 00:03:30,214
If it's tails then it's you.

7
00:03:31,491 --> 00:03:33,011
Look at that! It's heads.

8
00:03:33,036 --> 00:03:34,280
Cheliyan...

9
00:03:38,454 --> 00:03:40,174
I plead you.

10
00:03:41,728 --> 00:03:42,923
Look at that.

11
00:03:42,948 --> 00:03:44,188
He is pleading.

12
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,370
I've issues everywhere.

13
00:03:47,309 --> 00:03:49,829
Behind every issue is an enemy.

14
00:03:49,892 --> 00:03:50,612
But...

15
00:03:50,805 --> 00:03:52,885
you are my most wanted enemy.

16
00:03:54,175 --> 00:03:55,095
My men say...

17
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:58,930
that I've life threats from
many others out there.

18
00:03:59,852 --> 00:04:02,532
The minute I heard David is
on his way to finish me,

19
00:04:02,557 --> 00:04:05,357
it got me excited.

20
00:04:06,027 --> 00:04:09,167
For the past five years
you and your brother

21
00:04:09,192 --> 00:04:12,331
have been trying again
and again to kill me.

22
00:04:14,309 --> 00:04:18,149
So far the issue between us
is due to the properties.

23
00:04:18,944 --> 00:04:20,387
Well, that's business.

24
00:04:20,412 --> 00:04:22,572
If I finish off your brother...

25
00:04:23,014 --> 00:04:24,254
then that becomes personal.

26
00:04:24,471 --> 00:04:26,471
Won't you then try
to finish me off?

27
00:04:26,496 --> 00:04:27,016
You will!

28
00:04:27,209 --> 00:04:28,409
- You will!.
- Please Cheliyan.

29
00:04:28,566 --> 00:04:29,166
My bro...

30
00:04:29,452 --> 00:04:31,412
Please don't hurt my brother.

31
00:04:31,559 --> 00:04:32,519
What if I do so?

32
00:04:32,968 --> 00:04:34,088
What will you do?

33
00:04:34,113 --> 00:04:37,153
Are you going to bust us all
up and save your brother?

34
00:04:39,124 --> 00:04:41,884
You and your brother
are 1.5 kms away.

35
00:04:42,151 --> 00:04:45,711
But the knife that is pointed at your
brother's throat is just 1.5 inches away.

36
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:49,434
People kill each other
for petty wealth issues.

37
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,180
This issue is worth 6 billion!

38
00:04:51,608 --> 00:04:52,768
What did you expect?

39
00:04:53,146 --> 00:04:55,066
Obviously someone
will be finished.

40
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,767
The moment your brother
is finished off...

41
00:04:58,792 --> 00:05:00,152
you will go crazy.

42
00:05:00,427 --> 00:05:03,027
And out of that craziness won't
you come back for revenge?

43
00:05:03,555 --> 00:05:04,595
This is an great offer!

44
00:05:04,698 --> 00:05:05,418
Use it.

45
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:06,580
Because...

46
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:07,940
more than a friend...

47
00:05:08,238 --> 00:05:09,238
only an enemy,

48
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:12,926
I mean a enemy of your class...

49
00:05:12,954 --> 00:05:15,034
will allow a person like
me to live and prosper.

50
00:05:36,665 --> 00:05:38,005
Bro! Bro!

51
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,070
Where are you?

52
00:05:39,581 --> 00:05:41,141
Please come immediately.

53
00:05:41,752 --> 00:05:42,592
I'm scared.

54
00:05:42,746 --> 00:05:44,826
Please come and save me.

55
00:05:45,668 --> 00:05:47,068
Bro! Bro!

56
00:05:48,858 --> 00:05:50,663
Please tell me, where are you?

57
00:05:50,688 --> 00:05:51,848
Finish him off!

58
00:05:53,748 --> 00:05:55,791
Bro you there?

59
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,600
They are going to finish me!

60
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:01,131
I'm panicking.

61
00:06:01,156 --> 00:06:02,951
Please come fast.

62
00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:04,189
Bro!

63
00:07:25,834 --> 00:07:26,674
Moorthy...

64
00:07:27,893 --> 00:07:30,573
Go tell him that the
girl doesn't like him.

65
00:07:30,657 --> 00:07:33,057
Ask him not to waste
time and leave.

66
00:07:34,622 --> 00:07:36,302
Look at his face!
Who will like it?

67
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:40,105
Listen, our boy is not
like what you think...

68
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:41,690
I'm not here to create an issue.

69
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:44,549
Nor I'm in a mood
to create an issue.

70
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:46,078
Ask him to come here.

71
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:48,119
I just want to see him once.

72
00:07:54,556 --> 00:07:56,236
He doesn't seem to leave.

73
00:07:56,369 --> 00:07:58,195
He says he'll leave after
seeing Shiva once.

74
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,940
Why is he so stubborn like a kid
wanting to go to Disneyland?

75
00:08:01,929 --> 00:08:03,593
If he lays his eyes on Shiva...

76
00:08:03,618 --> 00:08:05,538
then he'll definitely
target him.

77
00:08:29,152 --> 00:08:29,752
Check!

78
00:08:42,031 --> 00:08:42,631
Here.

79
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:43,920
Thank you.

80
00:08:46,913 --> 00:08:47,593
See that dad?

81
00:08:47,618 --> 00:08:50,391
Look at him playing and sitting worry
free about what's happening outside.

82
00:08:50,899 --> 00:08:52,366
I won bro! I won!

83
00:08:52,391 --> 00:08:53,366
No you did not.

84
00:08:53,391 --> 00:08:54,471
It's our brother who won.

85
00:08:54,675 --> 00:08:55,155
Dear...

86
00:08:55,454 --> 00:08:56,694
Dad, are you done talking to him?

87
00:08:56,987 --> 00:08:57,987
We tried talking.

88
00:08:58,208 --> 00:08:59,085
He doesn't seem to leave.

89
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,390
He says, he wants to see you.

90
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,135
Fine.

91
00:09:01,492 --> 00:09:02,892
You don't have to meet him.

92
00:09:03,233 --> 00:09:04,421
You've already made
your decision.

93
00:09:04,446 --> 00:09:05,046
Shut up.

94
00:09:05,071 --> 00:09:07,751
You know what you have done and
it's not so easy to let it go.

95
00:09:07,776 --> 00:09:08,316
Dear...

96
00:09:08,341 --> 00:09:09,541
Please go talk to him.

97
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:10,370
- Fine.
- Bro!

98
00:09:10,738 --> 00:09:12,178
Wait, I'll go talk to him.

99
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:14,910
He keeps creating issues
every time he comes here.

100
00:09:14,935 --> 00:09:15,775
I pity Rathnam.

101
00:09:16,737 --> 00:09:18,337
David is a murderer.

102
00:09:18,841 --> 00:09:21,241
He has abducted the girl
David was about to marry.

103
00:09:21,266 --> 00:09:24,626
He'll know the pain only if something
that sorts happens to his family.

104
00:09:29,531 --> 00:09:30,171
Dear...

105
00:09:30,701 --> 00:09:31,221
Yes dad...

106
00:09:31,246 --> 00:09:32,166
Be patient.

107
00:09:32,595 --> 00:09:33,355
Fine.

108
00:09:34,362 --> 00:09:35,042
There he comes.

109
00:09:35,112 --> 00:09:37,112
Let me not talk to him
and get insulted.

110
00:09:37,268 --> 00:09:37,988
Greetings uncle.

111
00:09:38,013 --> 00:09:39,253
Let me maintain the silence.

112
00:09:40,239 --> 00:09:40,919
Uncle...

113
00:09:41,366 --> 00:09:43,406
I heard Radhika is going
to get married. Is it?

114
00:09:44,396 --> 00:09:45,986
I also heard that she
likes someone else?

115
00:09:46,011 --> 00:09:46,571
Is it true?

116
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:50,169
Uncle!

117
00:09:50,426 --> 00:09:51,786
Life is like a boat...

118
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:55,553
and we must let the
expert handle it.

119
00:09:55,578 --> 00:09:56,366
Understand?

120
00:09:56,391 --> 00:09:57,391
Stop pulling my leg.

121
00:09:57,725 --> 00:10:00,054
There is someone already
waiting to pull your leg. Now go.

122
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:00,959
- Go!
- Ok.

123
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,171
Easy! Calm down.

124
00:10:02,321 --> 00:10:03,053
Ok?

125
00:10:03,664 --> 00:10:04,424
Shiva...

126
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:07,330
don't you deliver punch dialogues
to him like you do with me.

127
00:10:07,821 --> 00:10:08,693
Now stop right there!

128
00:10:08,718 --> 00:10:09,798
Tell me what is it?

129
00:10:09,823 --> 00:10:10,967
My ears are working fine.

130
00:10:10,992 --> 00:10:11,752
Uncle...

131
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:13,091
punch dialogue?

132
00:10:13,174 --> 00:10:13,734
And me?

133
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:16,268
I'll talk soft.

134
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:49,901
Leave.

135
00:10:52,867 --> 00:10:54,027
I just wanted to see you.

136
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:55,051
You may leave.

137
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:55,981
David sir.

138
00:10:56,341 --> 00:10:57,421
I am here to talk.

139
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,739
I inquired about you
around your place.

140
00:11:00,764 --> 00:11:02,641
Then I realised that there
is no use talking to you.

141
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:03,986
That's why I abducted her.

142
00:11:04,182 --> 00:11:05,422
I'm sorry if it was a mistake.

143
00:11:07,176 --> 00:11:08,930
If you had abducted her
without knowing about me,

144
00:11:08,955 --> 00:11:11,200
I would have shown you who
I am, right here right now.

145
00:11:11,556 --> 00:11:12,967
You did it after
knowing about me.

146
00:11:12,992 --> 00:11:15,072
I'll wait for the right time.

147
00:11:15,663 --> 00:11:17,021
Be careful.

148
00:11:17,515 --> 00:11:18,826
Excuse me hero...

149
00:11:19,064 --> 00:11:19,664
Hero? Who?

150
00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:20,669
Of course you.

151
00:11:21,001 --> 00:11:24,637
You are leaving without the girl you were
about to marry. That makes you the hero.

152
00:11:35,921 --> 00:11:37,321
You must have done something.

153
00:11:38,066 --> 00:11:39,762
Why did you let him go?

154
00:11:40,758 --> 00:11:43,358
Just because it's tough to hunt
the lion in it's territory,

155
00:11:44,112 --> 00:11:46,112
killing a cat won't
make it up for it.

156
00:11:48,557 --> 00:11:49,237
He is a cat.

157
00:11:50,815 --> 00:11:52,615
Someday he'll come get
stuck in our trap.

158
00:11:52,816 --> 00:11:54,216
Then we can take care of him.

159
00:12:10,435 --> 00:12:11,155
Just like that!

160
00:12:15,225 --> 00:12:15,905
Just like that!

161
00:12:20,377 --> 00:12:22,857
The candies in the candy shop...

162
00:12:22,912 --> 00:12:25,335
And the girls in the temple...

163
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,760
They are just awesome!

164
00:12:26,785 --> 00:12:29,225
Oh yeah! They are just awesome!

165
00:12:29,812 --> 00:12:32,292
They beauty of this sight...

166
00:12:32,317 --> 00:12:34,677
And the nostalgia that it brings...

167
00:12:34,702 --> 00:12:36,102
That's life!

168
00:12:36,275 --> 00:12:38,595
That's THE life!

169
00:12:39,348 --> 00:12:41,748
Oh their smile; and
their dimple cheeks...

170
00:12:41,773 --> 00:12:44,053
takes me places.

171
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:46,598
There is a lot to say, but
then it's not so easy...

172
00:12:46,623 --> 00:12:48,783
and that makes love exciting.

173
00:12:48,808 --> 00:12:52,875
This is the love that was
preached by the great poets.

174
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:57,780
Be brave and fall in love.

175
00:12:57,805 --> 00:13:02,312
Be bold and take all the
risks for your love.

176
00:13:02,337 --> 00:13:07,177
Be brave and fall in love.

177
00:13:07,202 --> 00:13:12,202
Be bold and take all the
risks for your love.

178
00:13:12,227 --> 00:13:14,667
The candies in the candy shop...

179
00:13:14,692 --> 00:13:17,021
And the girls in the temple...

180
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,554
They are just awesome!

181
00:13:18,579 --> 00:13:20,859
Oh yeah! They are just awesome!

182
00:13:21,637 --> 00:13:24,077
They beauty of this sight...

183
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:26,550
And the nostalgia
that it brings...

184
00:13:26,575 --> 00:13:27,895
That's life!

185
00:13:28,025 --> 00:13:30,105
That's THE life!

186
00:14:09,115 --> 00:14:13,995
Love takes you to the extremes
you have never been to.

187
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,289
Love is a swing ride...

188
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:18,234
where you fall right at
the feet of an angel.

189
00:14:18,557 --> 00:14:20,953
The language of their eyes...

190
00:14:20,978 --> 00:14:23,378
showers rainfall on us.

191
00:14:23,403 --> 00:14:25,443
Love is a song...

192
00:14:25,563 --> 00:14:27,563
so listen to it and
live it dear Romeo.

193
00:14:27,588 --> 00:14:32,285
Love makes us do crazy things...

194
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:36,950
It makes you feel like
the king of the world.

195
00:14:36,975 --> 00:14:41,484
So jump into the sea of love.

196
00:14:41,509 --> 00:14:47,999
Ans swim against the tides and fight for
your love. Fight for it! Fight for it!

197
00:14:48,024 --> 00:14:52,742
Be brave and fall in love.

198
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:57,767
Be bold and take all the
risks for your love.

199
00:14:57,935 --> 00:15:00,295
The candies in the candy shop...

200
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,821
And the girls in the temple...

201
00:15:02,846 --> 00:15:04,526
They are just awesome!

202
00:15:04,551 --> 00:15:07,351
Oh yeah! They are just awesome!

203
00:15:07,431 --> 00:15:09,863
They beauty of this sight...

204
00:15:09,888 --> 00:15:12,245
And the nostalgia that it brings...

205
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,910
That's life!

206
00:15:13,935 --> 00:15:16,615
That's THE life!

207
00:15:16,725 --> 00:15:18,912
Oh their smile; and
their dimple cheeks...

208
00:15:18,937 --> 00:15:21,652
takes me places.

209
00:15:21,677 --> 00:15:23,943
There is a lot to say, but
then it's not so easy...

210
00:15:23,968 --> 00:15:26,248
and that makes love exciting.

211
00:15:26,319 --> 00:15:30,365
This is the love that was
preached by the great poets.

212
00:15:30,473 --> 00:15:35,068
Be brave and fall in love.

213
00:15:35,093 --> 00:15:39,844
Be bold and take all the
risks for your love.

214
00:15:39,869 --> 00:15:44,485
Be brave and fall in love.

215
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:50,070
Be bold and take all the
risks for your love.

216
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:23,779
Shiva.

217
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:25,837
Why did you do it?

218
00:16:26,614 --> 00:16:27,454
Mala?

219
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,270
Mala!

220
00:16:40,381 --> 00:16:41,541
Don't leave Mala.

221
00:16:43,144 --> 00:16:43,664
Mala...

222
00:16:44,123 --> 00:16:45,260
I'll talk to Selvam.

223
00:16:45,285 --> 00:16:46,018
Please don't leave.

224
00:16:46,043 --> 00:16:47,838
Please. Sorry. I'm sorry.

225
00:16:48,104 --> 00:16:49,184
I'll talk to Selvam.

226
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:51,130
Dear!

227
00:16:51,736 --> 00:16:54,024
- Oh no! Not again!
- Hey listen. Go stop him.

228
00:16:54,094 --> 00:16:54,734
Dear.

229
00:16:57,096 --> 00:16:58,296
I wonder how he handles him?

230
00:16:58,351 --> 00:16:59,551
Listen, dear.

231
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:00,950
It's nothing.

232
00:17:01,147 --> 00:17:03,038
- Bring him here.
- It's fine. Everything's alright.

233
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:03,575
Come on.

234
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,535
But Mala?

235
00:17:04,755 --> 00:17:05,435
Poor Mala.

236
00:17:06,698 --> 00:17:07,618
Slowly.

237
00:17:08,112 --> 00:17:08,992
Take it from him.

238
00:17:11,725 --> 00:17:13,605
- Go back to sleep.
- Yes, go back to bed.

239
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:14,390
You too.

240
00:17:14,415 --> 00:17:15,415
Go to bed dear.

241
00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:18,572
I wonder how long will he
keep pondering about Mala?

242
00:17:18,597 --> 00:17:19,277
Now sleep.

243
00:17:19,827 --> 00:17:21,707
We must take him to our deity's temple.

244
00:17:21,962 --> 00:17:23,682
Betrothal announcement.

245
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:28,120
The girl is grand daughter of Mr. Venkatachalam
and Mrs. Shenbagavalli of Kumbakonam...

246
00:17:28,269 --> 00:17:31,332
and daughter of Mr. Rathnasamy
and Ms. Ranjini...

247
00:17:31,409 --> 00:17:32,666
Ms. Kavitha.

248
00:17:32,691 --> 00:17:36,474
The boy is grandson of
Mr. Muthusmay and Ms. Ambujam...

249
00:17:36,499 --> 00:17:39,259
and son of Mr. Sakthivel
and Ms. Saraswati...

250
00:17:39,467 --> 00:17:41,224
Mr. Rajesh.

251
00:17:41,249 --> 00:17:44,733
They marriage is been fixed
by the elders to take place

252
00:17:44,758 --> 00:17:47,993
during the first auspicious
day of the Avini month.

253
00:17:51,584 --> 00:17:52,784
- Shiva...
- Yes dad...

254
00:17:52,809 --> 00:17:54,609
How is Srinivasan with you?

255
00:17:55,009 --> 00:17:55,969
Srinivasan who?

256
00:17:56,251 --> 00:17:59,301
Our lawyer, whom you are
serving as a junior.

257
00:17:59,326 --> 00:18:01,246
He is your friend. He
takes good care of me.

258
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:03,782
Today he might be a
famous criminal lawyer...

259
00:18:03,807 --> 00:18:05,847
but back then he was
a criminal himself.

260
00:18:06,326 --> 00:18:10,366
We friends helped him to elope with
his girlfriend and get married.

261
00:18:10,517 --> 00:18:12,517
After starting a family
he has changed for good.

262
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:15,789
You are helping lot of your friends
get married to their girlfriends.

263
00:18:15,814 --> 00:18:18,054
Why haven't you fallen in
love with someone yet?

264
00:18:18,276 --> 00:18:21,235
Feeling shy is it?

265
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,171
Well if you are planning
to fall in love...

266
00:18:22,203 --> 00:18:26,819
then ensure it is with a very beautiful
fair girl hailing from north.

267
00:18:26,844 --> 00:18:27,524
North?

268
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,598
That won't suit us.

269
00:18:29,623 --> 00:18:30,223
Why?

270
00:18:30,824 --> 00:18:32,346
When there are so many beautiful
girls from our place...

271
00:18:32,371 --> 00:18:34,371
What beauty are you
talking about?

272
00:18:34,726 --> 00:18:37,046
You should have seen the
girls during my youth.

273
00:18:37,071 --> 00:18:37,987
Hi.

274
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:38,346
Dad?

275
00:18:38,371 --> 00:18:39,851
I meant they have
turned old now.

276
00:18:40,045 --> 00:18:40,525
What?

277
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:41,470
Well...

278
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:42,356
what I am saying is.

279
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,291
If you marry a girl
from Madras...

280
00:18:44,316 --> 00:18:45,307
she can easily handle your mom.

281
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:47,947
Girls from our place aren't
so smart and clever.

282
00:18:47,972 --> 00:18:51,812
All those curses you hear around,
everything is your mother's invention.

283
00:18:51,837 --> 00:18:52,477
Damn it.

284
00:18:52,661 --> 00:18:54,107
Mr. Rathnam.

285
00:18:54,132 --> 00:18:55,372
You are talking too much.

286
00:18:55,397 --> 00:18:56,797
No, Mr. Shiva.

287
00:18:57,101 --> 00:18:58,803
My argument was...

288
00:18:58,828 --> 00:19:03,499
that let all the talks between us stay
between us and that's best for our family.

289
00:19:03,524 --> 00:19:04,913
Isn't it your honor?

290
00:19:04,938 --> 00:19:07,138
Yes your honor. You are too
good at making things up.

291
00:19:07,815 --> 00:19:09,735
Forget that.

292
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,111
Remember you are getting aged. So keep
that in mind and also what I said.

293
00:19:13,215 --> 00:19:13,735
Ok dad.

294
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,564
As soon as your sister gets
married, I want you to get married.

295
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:17,149
Ok dad.

296
00:19:17,626 --> 00:19:18,952
- Look here Shiva...
- Yes dad.

297
00:19:19,071 --> 00:19:21,111
- We must always be friends, like this.
- Ok dad.

298
00:19:21,136 --> 00:19:23,256
But in front of others we
should turn dad and son.

299
00:19:23,361 --> 00:19:24,358
Else they'll get jealous.

300
00:19:24,383 --> 00:19:26,631
- Ok dad.
- Within home we shall party as always.

301
00:19:27,665 --> 00:19:28,516
Ok dad.

302
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:31,501
Fine, I'll take Saminathan along
and go order the invitations.

303
00:19:31,526 --> 00:19:32,766
Saminathan is looking at us.

304
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:33,631
Is it?

305
00:19:34,415 --> 00:19:36,970
Head back to home. Understand!

306
00:19:36,995 --> 00:19:38,795
If I hear that you were
wandering around...

307
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,060
I'll bust you up.

308
00:19:40,085 --> 00:19:40,881
- Ok dad.
- Got it?

309
00:19:40,906 --> 00:19:41,946
- Yes dad.
- Now leave.

310
00:19:41,971 --> 00:19:42,552
Ok dad.

311
00:19:43,772 --> 00:19:45,372
Stop that wicked
smile and leave!

312
00:19:46,362 --> 00:19:48,522
Rathnam, why are you so
strict with your son?

313
00:19:48,547 --> 00:19:49,867
You must be friendly.

314
00:19:49,892 --> 00:19:51,492
Why do you keep yelling at him?

315
00:19:51,517 --> 00:19:52,437
Take me for example.

316
00:19:52,462 --> 00:19:54,507
Myself and my son
are good friends.

317
00:19:54,532 --> 00:19:56,412
Yes, I have heard about
your friendship.

318
00:19:56,437 --> 00:19:59,797
It is said that you guys drink together
and throw tantrums at each other. Is it?

319
00:19:59,956 --> 00:20:01,150
I don't need a son
who is a friend.

320
00:20:01,175 --> 00:20:03,175
I'll be happy if my son
is a good child to me.

321
00:20:02,423 --> 00:20:04,383
- Get out!
- Won't you give me a cup of tea?

322
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:05,696
I said get out!

323
00:20:05,696 --> 00:20:07,896
- Give me the tea.
- I'll break your head!

324
00:20:07,955 --> 00:20:09,715
- Get lost!
- Get lost!

325
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,626
Give me a cup of tea.

326
00:20:10,651 --> 00:20:12,131
Get lost! Take your
bag and leave.

327
00:20:13,019 --> 00:20:13,939
Why can't you give?

328
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:15,239
How dare you?

329
00:20:15,264 --> 00:20:16,295
You must be chased out of town!

330
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,357
Selvam!

331
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:18,990
Why are you insulting him?

332
00:20:19,339 --> 00:20:20,699
- What is it?
- Check this out Shiva.

333
00:20:20,724 --> 00:20:22,084
He is spoiling my business.

334
00:20:22,148 --> 00:20:23,388
I am not such a bad person.

335
00:20:23,413 --> 00:20:24,213
Look here Shiva.

336
00:20:24,238 --> 00:20:24,838
Look.

337
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:26,740
Look at that.

338
00:20:26,765 --> 00:20:29,125
He dragged this dog's corpse and
put it in front of the shop.

339
00:20:30,592 --> 00:20:31,752
Now, what is this?

340
00:20:31,777 --> 00:20:33,177
He refuses to serve
tea every time I ask.

341
00:20:33,202 --> 00:20:33,704
Wait I'll...

342
00:20:33,729 --> 00:20:35,188
I belong here. Isn't it?

343
00:20:35,213 --> 00:20:36,853
Fine. First, go dispose it off.

344
00:20:37,257 --> 00:20:37,777
Go.

345
00:20:38,539 --> 00:20:39,139
Come on now.

346
00:20:40,014 --> 00:20:41,254
Wait, let him go.

347
00:20:45,266 --> 00:20:45,866
Poor fellow!

348
00:20:45,901 --> 00:20:48,261
A guy who was supposed to be
a doctor, now look at him.

349
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,080
I returned ten days ago.

350
00:20:52,776 --> 00:20:53,169
I was looking for you...

351
00:20:53,194 --> 00:20:54,714
Hey! One more tea.

352
00:20:54,739 --> 00:20:55,939
Bro! Bro!

353
00:20:56,407 --> 00:20:57,127
One more tea.

354
00:20:57,342 --> 00:20:57,902
Ok Shiva.

355
00:20:59,052 --> 00:21:01,211
I looked for you everywhere.
Where were you?

356
00:21:01,477 --> 00:21:03,437
There was a coolie job vacancy.

357
00:21:03,793 --> 00:21:05,353
But they were ill
treating the workers.

358
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:07,659
They refused to pay the wages.

359
00:21:08,508 --> 00:21:10,628
They even refused
to pay us for food.

360
00:21:11,076 --> 00:21:12,116
Look what they did.

361
00:21:13,336 --> 00:21:15,096
- Oh my!
- I don't have money to treat it.

362
00:21:15,682 --> 00:21:17,608
I just applied little gum that
is used to stick posters.

363
00:21:17,633 --> 00:21:18,593
- It'll dry up.
- You!

364
00:21:18,618 --> 00:21:20,381
- Come let's go to the hospital.
- No Shiva.

365
00:21:20,406 --> 00:21:21,966
- I said come.
- Leave me Shiva.

366
00:21:22,282 --> 00:21:23,042
Give me money.

367
00:21:23,941 --> 00:21:24,821
I'm myself a doctor.

368
00:21:24,846 --> 00:21:25,566
Forgot that?

369
00:21:25,704 --> 00:21:27,064
Give me money. I'll take care.

370
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:28,250
Give me some money.

371
00:21:32,622 --> 00:21:33,342
Here.

372
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:35,022
Enough?

373
00:21:36,944 --> 00:21:37,544
I'll take care.

374
00:21:38,445 --> 00:21:39,765
Wait brother.

375
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:40,790
Sit down.

376
00:21:41,639 --> 00:21:43,264
First, go to the hospital.

377
00:21:43,289 --> 00:21:43,809
Ok?

378
00:21:44,255 --> 00:21:46,335
Then head to the saloon
and get a good haircut.

379
00:21:46,715 --> 00:21:47,995
My sister's marriage is fixed.

380
00:21:48,075 --> 00:21:48,857
Sister's marriage?

381
00:21:48,882 --> 00:21:49,794
Yes.

382
00:21:49,819 --> 00:21:50,619
Sister's marriage?

383
00:21:50,742 --> 00:21:52,108
Yes indeed.

384
00:21:52,133 --> 00:21:53,413
I've got new set of
clothes for you too.

385
00:21:53,488 --> 00:21:56,008
So come to home from the saloon.

386
00:21:56,084 --> 00:21:56,524
Ok?

387
00:21:57,008 --> 00:21:57,608
Now go.

388
00:21:58,471 --> 00:21:59,511
First to the hospital.

389
00:21:59,739 --> 00:22:00,262
- Ok.
- Ok?

390
00:22:00,287 --> 00:22:01,007
Ok. I'll go.

391
00:22:48,879 --> 00:22:49,759
Shiva!

392
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,360
Shiva.

393
00:22:56,426 --> 00:22:56,986
Come here.

394
00:22:58,373 --> 00:22:59,293
I'll cane you!

395
00:23:00,709 --> 00:23:01,509
Come here now.

396
00:23:02,901 --> 00:23:03,381
Uncle...

397
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:09,710
Yes, tell me.

398
00:23:09,926 --> 00:23:12,206
Uncle, can you do me a favour?

399
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,520
What favour do you want?

400
00:23:13,545 --> 00:23:14,345
Uncle...

401
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:16,737
aren't you the one who helps everyone
get married to their lovers?

402
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:18,442
Please help me too.

403
00:23:18,774 --> 00:23:19,894
What do you mean?

404
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,000
You mean get you married?

405
00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:32,232
Please uncle.

406
00:23:32,257 --> 00:23:33,017
Fine. Ok.

407
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:34,830
Don't cry.

408
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:35,519
Don't cry.

409
00:23:35,801 --> 00:23:37,641
Tomorrow morning the
event will take place.

410
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:38,607
- Ok uncle.
- Ok?

411
00:23:38,632 --> 00:23:39,912
Tell your mother not to worry.

412
00:23:39,969 --> 00:23:40,649
Now leave.

413
00:23:44,624 --> 00:23:46,812
Off late you don't even tell
whom we are going to help.

414
00:23:46,837 --> 00:23:48,849
Look at this.

415
00:23:48,989 --> 00:23:51,201
Even the village heads are
now given a car with siren.

416
00:23:51,473 --> 00:23:52,993
Look at the registration number.

417
00:23:53,018 --> 00:23:54,378
TN 59, it's from Madurai.

418
00:23:54,675 --> 00:23:56,075
Looks like some politician.

419
00:23:56,824 --> 00:23:57,544
Are you afraid?

420
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,510
What do you mean?

421
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:00,656
Please lead.

422
00:24:17,592 --> 00:24:18,192
Seeta.

423
00:24:18,389 --> 00:24:19,309
So many Seetas?

424
00:24:20,443 --> 00:24:21,163
Who are you?

425
00:24:21,211 --> 00:24:22,331
Now who is that?

426
00:24:22,356 --> 00:24:23,436
Who are you guys?

427
00:24:26,017 --> 00:24:27,137
What are you doing?

428
00:24:37,171 --> 00:24:38,091
Where are you?

429
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:40,799
Someone just entered our house
and abducted all our girls.

430
00:24:43,561 --> 00:24:44,394
May you live long.

431
00:24:44,434 --> 00:24:45,074
Indeed.

432
00:24:45,099 --> 00:24:46,139
- Thank you very much.
- It's ok.

433
00:24:46,164 --> 00:24:48,564
Stop thanking us and bless us.

434
00:24:48,589 --> 00:24:49,429
May god bless you.

435
00:24:50,196 --> 00:24:51,276
Congrats grandma.

436
00:24:51,418 --> 00:24:52,621
So what next? Honeymoon in Goa?

437
00:24:52,646 --> 00:24:53,238
It's a party land.

438
00:24:53,263 --> 00:24:54,503
Now stop it. Shut up.

439
00:24:56,339 --> 00:24:57,379
I am so happy now.

440
00:24:57,404 --> 00:25:00,434
I came here long back. Now thanks
to you I visited this temple again.

441
00:25:00,459 --> 00:25:01,309
Are you happy?

442
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:02,134
Indeed.

443
00:25:03,094 --> 00:25:04,174
It was him.

444
00:25:04,489 --> 00:25:06,089
Dad, this lady abuses a lot!

445
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:07,770
Don't you have manners?

446
00:25:07,795 --> 00:25:08,667
There you go!

447
00:25:09,082 --> 00:25:10,562
Gone are those days.

448
00:25:10,999 --> 00:25:13,999
Now a days everyone takes care
of their in laws very well.

449
00:25:14,231 --> 00:25:15,151
And you...

450
00:25:15,778 --> 00:25:17,848
80th anniversary is
an auspicious event.

451
00:25:17,873 --> 00:25:21,313
It is considered to be one of the most
prestigious function in a family.

452
00:25:21,795 --> 00:25:22,995
How dare you talk like that?

453
00:25:23,554 --> 00:25:24,354
Come again.

454
00:25:24,843 --> 00:25:26,083
What can you do about it?

455
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:27,708
You'll put us behind the bars?

456
00:25:27,902 --> 00:25:29,342
Or will you set your
henchmen to thrash us?

457
00:25:29,367 --> 00:25:30,407
That is all you know.

458
00:25:30,432 --> 00:25:31,832
I know about people like you.

459
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:34,757
You'll salute those who throw
rubbish on the streets.

460
00:25:34,782 --> 00:25:37,062
And insult the ones who cleans it.

461
00:25:37,258 --> 00:25:39,578
Now why are you getting
furious over my son?

462
00:25:40,426 --> 00:25:41,026
Look here...

463
00:25:41,261 --> 00:25:44,149
the marriage conducted by parents
for their children is an event.

464
00:25:44,174 --> 00:25:45,414
That is usual.

465
00:25:45,561 --> 00:25:48,561
But the 80th anniversary function of
parents is a blessing to be witnessed.

466
00:25:48,688 --> 00:25:50,528
And conducting it for
them is a god's gift.

467
00:25:50,553 --> 00:25:53,226
You are not lucky to
have it but my son is.

468
00:25:53,251 --> 00:25:56,251
Now go. Go inside and get their
blessing if you want some.

469
00:25:56,276 --> 00:25:56,836
Move.

470
00:25:57,271 --> 00:25:58,711
Make it fast.

471
00:25:58,736 --> 00:26:00,096
Before they are off
to their honeymoon.

472
00:26:00,121 --> 00:26:00,847
Shiva...

473
00:26:00,872 --> 00:26:03,064
you have helped many people
unite with their lovers.

474
00:26:03,089 --> 00:26:04,529
And there were many problems.

475
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:05,836
I had wondered then...

476
00:26:05,861 --> 00:26:07,421
that you might be
doing a mistake.

477
00:26:07,633 --> 00:26:09,073
But not anymore.

478
00:26:09,098 --> 00:26:11,058
You keep doing this service.
I am with you.

479
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:12,363
- Is it?
- Indeed.

480
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,965
Call me if you need any help.

481
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:15,470
I'll too join you.
I'm really quick.

482
00:26:15,495 --> 00:26:16,113
Ok dad.

483
00:26:16,138 --> 00:26:18,231
Do you doubt me? Why
don't you tell him?

484
00:26:18,256 --> 00:26:20,816
Yep indeed, you must watch him
take off when mom is upset!

485
00:26:20,841 --> 00:26:22,801
Mind your tongue or
else I'll curse you.

486
00:26:22,826 --> 00:26:23,266
Uncle.

487
00:26:26,628 --> 00:26:27,388
Come here.

488
00:26:28,983 --> 00:26:29,703
Had your food?

489
00:26:31,697 --> 00:26:32,858
What else?

490
00:26:33,206 --> 00:26:34,006
Are you happy?

491
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:34,942
Yes.

492
00:26:34,967 --> 00:26:36,287
Are you indeed happy?

493
00:26:36,437 --> 00:26:37,077
Indeed happy!

494
00:26:37,826 --> 00:26:39,934
My mom is depressed and
won't stop crying.

495
00:26:39,959 --> 00:26:41,439
Further she is refusing to eat food.

496
00:26:41,684 --> 00:26:45,308
They say that grandpa is
weak and will die soon.

497
00:26:45,333 --> 00:26:49,458
My mom wanted to celebrate the
60th anniversary of grandpa.

498
00:26:49,512 --> 00:26:50,476
But it didn't happen.

499
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:52,996
Now he is 80 years old.

500
00:26:53,036 --> 00:26:57,196
And my mom is depressed as she is unable
to celebrate the 80th anniversary...

501
00:26:57,221 --> 00:27:01,781
because her brother and his wife have
house arrested grandma at their place.

502
00:27:01,806 --> 00:27:05,246
I request you to please bring our
grandma out from there. Please uncle.

503
00:27:05,271 --> 00:27:05,831
Ok?

504
00:27:06,903 --> 00:27:08,143
Here, hold your daughter.

505
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:10,375
Always stay happy.

506
00:27:10,805 --> 00:27:11,685
Bye dear.
[Hasan MRp @ Alpha13 MediaWorks]

507
00:27:17,644 --> 00:27:18,484
Give it to me.

508
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,840
- Dear...
- Yes dad.

509
00:27:21,865 --> 00:27:22,785
I forgot something.

510
00:27:22,935 --> 00:27:25,895
Here, go pay this money for
the shelf in Chandru's shop.

511
00:27:25,989 --> 00:27:28,309
I'll go upstairs
and buy a new tv.

512
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:31,214
We'll also have to go the utensils shop.
So make it fast.

513
00:27:32,786 --> 00:27:33,506
Finish him!

514
00:27:35,812 --> 00:27:36,452
Finish him!

515
00:27:38,774 --> 00:27:41,690
Should I deliver the cot and shelf
at home or the marriage hall?

516
00:27:41,715 --> 00:27:43,339
Deliver it at home.

517
00:27:43,364 --> 00:27:44,684
Fine it'll be delivered
by tomorrow evening.

518
00:27:45,016 --> 00:27:46,016
- Ok thanks.
- Thank you.

519
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:56,265
Finish him now!

520
00:27:57,112 --> 00:27:57,872
Brother...

521
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:32,387
Leave him.

522
00:28:32,413 --> 00:28:33,333
Go die now!

523
00:29:46,136 --> 00:29:47,376
Dad I shall go check...

524
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:53,350
Listen...

525
00:29:53,742 --> 00:29:54,302
Dad?

526
00:29:54,327 --> 00:29:55,702
Where did you say you are going?

527
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:56,772
I said I'll go check
the tv delivery.

528
00:30:00,203 --> 00:30:01,643
Ok. Be careful.

529
00:30:03,721 --> 00:30:04,161
Ok dad.

530
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:14,890
The other day when he came here...

531
00:30:14,915 --> 00:30:17,955
if he had behaved violently
thing would've been normal.

532
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:20,119
But he didn't create any issue.

533
00:30:20,417 --> 00:30:22,737
He just wanted to
have a look at Shiva.

534
00:30:22,939 --> 00:30:24,299
He left after he saw Shiva.

535
00:30:25,077 --> 00:30:26,957
That's what is worrying me.

536
00:30:26,982 --> 00:30:28,822
He finished off a man in broad daylight....

537
00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:31,554
you should have seen
the look in his face.

538
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:33,519
I saw a rage in his eyes.

539
00:30:34,109 --> 00:30:35,164
The same rage...

540
00:30:35,537 --> 00:30:38,884
is what I saw in his eyes when left the other
day after taking a good look at our son.

541
00:30:38,909 --> 00:30:40,349
I am not afraid.

542
00:30:41,189 --> 00:30:43,069
But you know how
strong my dad is.

543
00:30:44,337 --> 00:30:45,617
I don't know if he saw it too.

544
00:30:46,554 --> 00:30:48,699
But I could see him worry
that it could happen to me.

545
00:30:48,724 --> 00:30:50,044
Nothing that sorts will happen.

546
00:30:50,069 --> 00:30:52,029
Let's go visit our
deity's temple.

547
00:30:52,054 --> 00:30:54,294
We'll offer our
prayers and return.

548
00:30:54,802 --> 00:30:55,965
God will take care of the rest.

549
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:57,310
Stop thinking unnecessary things.

550
00:30:59,873 --> 00:31:00,473
Keera...

551
00:31:01,666 --> 00:31:04,506
it is said that we recollect all ours
mistakes when fear approaches us.

552
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:08,701
Imagine how many lovers we would have
united and earned their parent's curse?

553
00:31:08,974 --> 00:31:09,894
Same parents...

554
00:31:09,959 --> 00:31:12,336
have come visited you
and thanked you later.

555
00:31:12,376 --> 00:31:14,176
I know the mistakes
that I am committing.

556
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:16,506
But a dad who believes his
son has never wronged...

557
00:31:16,531 --> 00:31:18,803
A mom that believes her son
only does the correct thing...

558
00:31:18,828 --> 00:31:20,228
Do you what's our wish?

559
00:31:20,486 --> 00:31:22,126
My sister Kavitha's marriage.

560
00:31:22,897 --> 00:31:26,076
I am worried that I shouldn't invite
any troubles during her marriage.

561
00:31:26,101 --> 00:31:28,644
Nothing of that sorts will happen.
Don't worry.

562
00:31:31,304 --> 00:31:32,784
Please do come for the marriage.

563
00:31:32,947 --> 00:31:35,947
You have become very busy since
the marriage works are on.

564
00:31:36,113 --> 00:31:37,953
Why don't you call me if you need any help?

565
00:31:37,978 --> 00:31:40,887
I help everyone around when
there is a marriage function.

566
00:31:40,912 --> 00:31:43,792
This is my daughter's marriage and
that too the first one in my family.

567
00:31:43,817 --> 00:31:45,577
I will myself do everything
that is required.

568
00:31:45,617 --> 00:31:48,257
You come for the wedding
and bless the couples.

569
00:31:48,282 --> 00:31:49,722
Please bring your family along.

570
00:31:49,747 --> 00:31:50,787
Definitely.

571
00:31:51,336 --> 00:31:51,816
See you.

572
00:31:51,841 --> 00:31:52,881
Please do come.

573
00:31:52,906 --> 00:31:54,626
Please bring your family along.

574
00:31:54,651 --> 00:31:55,851
Definitely.

575
00:32:17,781 --> 00:32:20,032
Stop looking around and sprinkle
the rose water at the guests.

576
00:32:20,057 --> 00:32:21,857
Please don't attend this wedding.

577
00:32:22,512 --> 00:32:23,977
Greetings. Welcome.

578
00:32:24,002 --> 00:32:24,722
It was not for you.

579
00:32:24,747 --> 00:32:25,985
Mani! Come in.

580
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:28,010
No, I won't!

581
00:32:28,035 --> 00:32:28,635
Welcome.

582
00:32:28,887 --> 00:32:30,767
I said don't go in!

583
00:32:31,041 --> 00:32:32,241
Please do have food
before leaving.

584
00:32:32,266 --> 00:32:34,026
Yes leave immediately
after eating food.

585
00:32:34,257 --> 00:32:35,217
Mani!

586
00:32:35,383 --> 00:32:36,783
I said get inside or
else I'll thrash you.

587
00:32:36,808 --> 00:32:37,809
Then return to you home.

588
00:32:37,834 --> 00:32:40,278
I don't have any respect there either.
Then why go there?

589
00:32:40,303 --> 00:32:41,023
Then go die!

590
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:42,215
You'll at least get
the final respect.

591
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,145
Stop it now!

592
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:44,410
What else do you expect?

593
00:32:44,435 --> 00:32:45,075
What is it dad?

594
00:32:45,294 --> 00:32:48,414
Your cousin is drunk. He is
creating unwanted issues. Go check.

595
00:32:48,777 --> 00:32:50,825
Shiva, you tell me, why
does no one respect me?

596
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:52,089
Now who invited him?

597
00:32:52,413 --> 00:32:54,801
You are the right person
present at the right time.

598
00:32:54,826 --> 00:32:55,746
Now come on.

599
00:32:55,771 --> 00:32:57,011
Yes, move left.

600
00:32:57,095 --> 00:32:57,649
I said left.

601
00:32:57,674 --> 00:32:58,954
There's your respect!

602
00:32:59,373 --> 00:33:00,413
Listen...

603
00:33:00,835 --> 00:33:01,330
What is it?

604
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:01,970
Listen.

605
00:33:01,995 --> 00:33:03,321
Is our daughter missing?

606
00:33:03,346 --> 00:33:04,466
And you ask me to shut up!

607
00:33:04,582 --> 00:33:05,876
It's because of your company.

608
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:06,981
Shut up! Now listen...

609
00:33:07,006 --> 00:33:08,406
come and unlock the jewels.

610
00:33:08,431 --> 00:33:10,071
You have the keys to the locker.

611
00:33:10,096 --> 00:33:10,616
Is it?

612
00:33:11,256 --> 00:33:12,256
Oh yes. Indeed.

613
00:33:12,623 --> 00:33:13,191
- Now go.
- Ok.

614
00:33:13,417 --> 00:33:14,826
Are the sweets here yet?

615
00:33:14,851 --> 00:33:16,434
Hey Keera...

616
00:33:16,459 --> 00:33:18,696
it's marriage time and all
your friends must be here.

617
00:33:18,751 --> 00:33:20,012
No plans?

618
00:33:20,037 --> 00:33:21,576
Indeed. Waiting for
you to sponsor.

619
00:33:21,639 --> 00:33:22,159
Here.

620
00:33:22,267 --> 00:33:22,896
2 beers!

621
00:33:22,896 --> 00:33:23,416
4 beers!

622
00:33:23,441 --> 00:33:24,799
2 double larges. 4 double larges.
8 double larges.

623
00:33:24,824 --> 00:33:26,664
- Chicken side dish and for smokes.
- There enough for everything.

624
00:33:26,689 --> 00:33:27,529
Still not enough.

625
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:30,909
Don't go overboard. You have to attend the
marriage at early morning. Now leave.

626
00:33:31,591 --> 00:33:32,551
Anything for you?

627
00:33:32,576 --> 00:33:34,476
Don't you know about my wife?

628
00:33:34,501 --> 00:33:36,101
Does she drink too?
So anything for her?

629
00:33:36,126 --> 00:33:37,126
She'll thrash!

630
00:33:37,438 --> 00:33:38,558
You? Already you look so.

631
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:39,503
I meant you.

632
00:33:39,567 --> 00:33:40,858
What are you doing there?

633
00:33:40,883 --> 00:33:42,983
I was telling him to buy juice.
Wait I'm coming.

634
00:33:43,368 --> 00:33:43,808
Now...

635
00:33:44,851 --> 00:33:45,931
you trimmed your hair.

636
00:33:46,803 --> 00:33:48,238
You could also have
trimmed your beard.

637
00:33:51,698 --> 00:33:52,769
Shiva...

638
00:33:52,794 --> 00:33:54,114
when are you getting married?

639
00:33:54,774 --> 00:33:55,654
Myself?

640
00:33:56,049 --> 00:33:58,089
I have a brother called Selvam.

641
00:33:58,664 --> 00:34:00,424
First he has to get married.

642
00:34:00,472 --> 00:34:02,328
Then I, Shiva will get married.

643
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:03,030
Ok?

644
00:34:04,085 --> 00:34:05,445
Bring Mala and I'll get married.

645
00:34:06,055 --> 00:34:06,935
I'll get married.

646
00:34:08,717 --> 00:34:10,237
Muruga! Muruga!

647
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:11,599
Wait I'll join you.

648
00:34:12,947 --> 00:34:14,304
Come here.

649
00:34:16,553 --> 00:34:17,473
Don't fight over it.

650
00:34:18,359 --> 00:34:19,839
That's for the side dish.

651
00:34:20,274 --> 00:34:20,834
Don't shout.

652
00:34:21,051 --> 00:34:23,171
Guys take enough chocolates
for your girlfriends.

653
00:34:28,131 --> 00:34:29,051
Why so late?

654
00:34:29,076 --> 00:34:30,476
Why? What's the hurry?

655
00:34:30,633 --> 00:34:31,953
Hurry up. It's already late.

656
00:34:31,978 --> 00:34:33,938
Fine. Come on, it's time for a treat.

657
00:34:42,176 --> 00:34:43,902
I'm here at the Koot road wine shop.
Make it fast.

658
00:34:43,927 --> 00:34:44,939
He just broke it!

659
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:46,246
Why did you break it?

660
00:34:46,458 --> 00:34:47,298
Don't you like it?

661
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,400
Take the money.

662
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,400
You can stare at me later.
Just take money.

663
00:34:52,351 --> 00:34:54,631
Put in my pocket. My hands are full.

664
00:34:55,829 --> 00:34:57,106
Why is your hair so rough?

665
00:34:57,138 --> 00:34:58,498
You get oil sachets for a buck.

666
00:34:58,921 --> 00:35:02,721
Nothing buddy. Just a small kid. He was
staring at me and it looked so funny.

667
00:35:07,259 --> 00:35:09,420
Now what is this?
It's not enough.

668
00:35:09,445 --> 00:35:10,605
I got two bottles.

669
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,818
One fellow dashed me and
broke one of the bottles.

670
00:35:12,843 --> 00:35:14,166
Who is it?

671
00:35:14,986 --> 00:35:17,106
That fellow with the
blue striped shirt.

672
00:35:18,792 --> 00:35:20,832
He didn't even apologize!

673
00:35:27,654 --> 00:35:30,814
What kind of a bar is this? The drinks
are warm and the food has gone cold!

674
00:35:32,416 --> 00:35:34,816
Are you here to collect empty bottles?
I'll let you know.

675
00:35:34,816 --> 00:35:36,576
Empty bottles can earn him few bucks.

676
00:35:37,131 --> 00:35:39,740
How dare you break our bottle
and don't even give an apology?

677
00:35:39,765 --> 00:35:40,525
Boss! Hold on.

678
00:35:40,625 --> 00:35:42,025
Boss. Sorry boss. Sorry.

679
00:35:42,225 --> 00:35:42,826
Sorry boss.

680
00:35:42,851 --> 00:35:44,714
Didn't I ask you to booze
at the hall itself?

681
00:35:45,148 --> 00:35:45,828
Idiots.

682
00:35:46,373 --> 00:35:47,093
Boss...

683
00:35:47,284 --> 00:35:48,844
let that be.

684
00:35:48,869 --> 00:35:51,066
He broke our bottle and over
that he didn't apologize.

685
00:35:51,091 --> 00:35:51,691
Boss!

686
00:35:51,716 --> 00:35:52,356
Sorry boss!

687
00:35:52,381 --> 00:35:54,496
Tell me the brand and the drink.
I'll buy you.

688
00:35:54,521 --> 00:35:56,201
Or tell me and I
shall apologize.

689
00:35:56,531 --> 00:35:57,439
I'll apologize.

690
00:35:57,464 --> 00:35:58,276
Shut up.

691
00:35:59,337 --> 00:36:00,782
Inviting troubles!

692
00:36:00,807 --> 00:36:01,527
Idiots.

693
00:36:02,284 --> 00:36:02,884
Tell me boss.

694
00:36:05,471 --> 00:36:06,231
Boss...

695
00:36:06,671 --> 00:36:08,231
you can talk later. Come here.

696
00:36:08,314 --> 00:36:09,794
There is no issues here.
Come on.

697
00:36:09,819 --> 00:36:10,819
Ask him to come.

698
00:36:10,844 --> 00:36:13,564
Come on. Tell me what do
you guys want to drink?

699
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,807
Looks like the brand we
drink isn't available here.

700
00:36:20,725 --> 00:36:23,244
Looks like it is available in the
shop by the market. Come on.

701
00:36:31,483 --> 00:36:33,660
You guys head to the marriage hall.

702
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:50,100
Buddy, this is
David's warehouse.

703
00:37:05,572 --> 00:37:06,332
Keera...

704
00:37:06,478 --> 00:37:08,878
no matter what, he shouldn't
know about the marriage. Ok?

705
00:37:09,997 --> 00:37:12,557
Is the liquor shop at
your place shutdown?

706
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,480
A small function...

707
00:37:15,505 --> 00:37:16,065
hence...

708
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:16,890
Is it a wedding?

709
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:17,630
Yes.

710
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:19,737
Friend's wedding?

711
00:37:19,762 --> 00:37:20,482
Yes.

712
00:37:20,666 --> 00:37:22,586
You would interfere in
others wedding and...

713
00:37:22,611 --> 00:37:24,931
expect your friend's marriage
to take place in harmony.

714
00:37:25,229 --> 00:37:28,349
Both of them love each other and their families
agreed to it. Hence they are getting married.

715
00:37:28,374 --> 00:37:31,254
We just planned to gift them
and then go ahead and booze.

716
00:37:31,279 --> 00:37:34,559
He broke our bottle and over
that he didn't even apologize.

717
00:37:34,807 --> 00:37:35,582
Too much attitude!

718
00:37:35,607 --> 00:37:36,887
I'll buy them the liquor.

719
00:37:54,553 --> 00:37:56,273
So you don't look who it is...

720
00:38:02,747 --> 00:38:04,307
You'll show your attitude to all.

721
00:38:06,679 --> 00:38:11,239
"Our friend Shiva's
sister's marriage."

722
00:38:12,996 --> 00:38:14,156
A marriage in your family?

723
00:38:14,438 --> 00:38:14,958
No.

724
00:38:15,183 --> 00:38:15,703
Yours?

725
00:38:16,631 --> 00:38:18,671
Why? Can't have I friend
by the name Shiva?

726
00:38:18,901 --> 00:38:20,424
We have another
friend called Shiva.

727
00:38:20,449 --> 00:38:23,089
It's a marriage in his family
and that's the invitation.

728
00:38:23,207 --> 00:38:26,346
Where were they boozing?

729
00:38:26,371 --> 00:38:27,411
Near the Koot road.

730
00:38:27,436 --> 00:38:28,956
Send our men to
this marriage hall.

731
00:38:30,207 --> 00:38:32,047
I would like to know
whose marriage it is.

732
00:38:57,215 --> 00:38:58,095
It's in Thiruvayar.

733
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:58,920
Thiruvayar?

734
00:38:59,251 --> 00:39:00,571
It's indeed his
sister's wedding.

735
00:39:00,702 --> 00:39:01,382
At Padithorai.

736
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:02,140
Padithorai?

737
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,140
Yes.

738
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:05,660
Is it your sister's marriage?

739
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:06,882
David...

740
00:39:06,907 --> 00:39:08,070
please don't create any issue.

741
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:08,695
Keera stop it.

742
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,440
Please let's not
invite any trouble.

743
00:39:10,465 --> 00:39:11,305
Keep quite.

744
00:39:11,936 --> 00:39:13,456
I didn't think of it so far.

745
00:39:13,903 --> 00:39:15,303
But just now when you said...

746
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:16,847
I think it's a good idea.

747
00:39:16,872 --> 00:39:17,432
Buddy!

748
00:39:17,738 --> 00:39:18,378
Wait.

749
00:39:19,151 --> 00:39:19,711
Mani.

750
00:39:20,085 --> 00:39:22,565
Attack any four of them
standing by the marriage hall.

751
00:39:25,997 --> 00:39:28,133
- I should hear their screams here! Attack!
- David please.

752
00:39:28,158 --> 00:39:28,678
Attack!

753
00:39:28,703 --> 00:39:30,623
Let's talk. David
please let's talk.

754
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:31,850
David give me a minute.

755
00:39:31,875 --> 00:39:33,235
Please listen to me.

756
00:39:33,467 --> 00:39:35,027
Welcome. Are you all
Shiva's friends?

757
00:39:35,052 --> 00:39:36,452
Please come in and have a seat.

758
00:39:36,477 --> 00:39:37,077
Come in.

759
00:39:38,289 --> 00:39:39,089
Come on now.

760
00:39:39,114 --> 00:39:40,394
Please get inside and be seated.

761
00:39:41,204 --> 00:39:41,990
Come on.

762
00:39:42,014 --> 00:39:42,534
Get in.

763
00:39:43,293 --> 00:39:44,632
David, I did interfere
in your marriage.

764
00:39:45,094 --> 00:39:45,974
So interfere in mine.

765
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:48,110
You have got nothing
against my family.

766
00:39:48,258 --> 00:39:49,938
But I do have a
vengeance against you.

767
00:39:50,284 --> 00:39:51,004
That is enough.

768
00:39:51,029 --> 00:39:51,909
It was my mistake.

769
00:39:52,271 --> 00:39:53,591
Tell me and I shall do anything.

770
00:39:53,616 --> 00:39:54,893
But please don't create
issues at the hall.

771
00:39:54,918 --> 00:39:55,718
Hurt me instead.

772
00:39:55,929 --> 00:39:57,129
Anything you want.

773
00:39:57,154 --> 00:39:58,074
Are you a slut?

774
00:39:58,355 --> 00:39:59,715
You sound like one.

775
00:40:01,768 --> 00:40:02,968
Order me David.

776
00:40:03,298 --> 00:40:04,618
I want to get married.

777
00:40:04,643 --> 00:40:05,963
And what should I do about it?

778
00:40:05,988 --> 00:40:07,108
Take the groom with you.

779
00:40:07,206 --> 00:40:08,726
And get him married.

780
00:40:08,982 --> 00:40:11,782
If possible, wait and see
them off to their honey moon.

781
00:40:14,525 --> 00:40:16,605
I'm ready to help you; and
that's for my family.

782
00:40:16,988 --> 00:40:18,948
I'll can also bash you for the same.

783
00:40:20,226 --> 00:40:20,706
Tell me!

784
00:40:21,622 --> 00:40:23,182
I'm saying it with
a smiling face.

785
00:40:23,207 --> 00:40:24,567
But I'll seriously act upon it.

786
00:40:25,083 --> 00:40:26,549
What will you do?

787
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:28,900
Tell me!

788
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,510
I'll do anything for you David.

789
00:40:30,535 --> 00:40:32,255
So you tell me. What
do you want me to do?

790
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,280
You interfered and
stopped my marriage.

791
00:40:34,683 --> 00:40:35,989
I want to get married
immediately.

792
00:40:36,014 --> 00:40:37,214
Get me a bride and...

793
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:38,639
leave.

794
00:40:39,696 --> 00:40:40,739
Fine David.

795
00:40:40,764 --> 00:40:42,764
Tell me who is the bride?
I'll bring her for you.

796
00:40:53,426 --> 00:40:54,598
This is the girl.

797
00:40:54,623 --> 00:40:56,663
She is going to get
married in two months.

798
00:40:56,938 --> 00:40:58,138
But we love each other.

799
00:40:58,570 --> 00:41:00,090
Now go. Go bring her.

800
00:41:02,739 --> 00:41:04,223
You should have
told this earlier.

801
00:41:04,248 --> 00:41:04,848
Wait.

802
00:41:05,376 --> 00:41:06,650
I'll kidnap her and
give you a call.

803
00:41:06,675 --> 00:41:07,961
Where should I bring her?

804
00:41:08,136 --> 00:41:10,064
First go abduct her.

805
00:41:10,854 --> 00:41:13,541
If you succeed, then
take her anywhere.

806
00:41:13,566 --> 00:41:14,806
I've men everywhere.

807
00:41:15,841 --> 00:41:16,961
OK David. Fine.

808
00:41:16,986 --> 00:41:19,246
After nodding,

809
00:41:19,271 --> 00:41:23,871
if you head to your sister's
wedding and cheat us, then...

810
00:41:24,603 --> 00:41:27,563
no one will be alive at
your sister's marriage.

811
00:41:30,184 --> 00:41:31,265
Listen boss.

812
00:41:31,522 --> 00:41:33,242
Do you think only
heroes can thrash?

813
00:41:34,573 --> 00:41:36,613
What about the common man?
Won't they thrash?

814
00:41:36,723 --> 00:41:38,243
Now leave! Go!

815
00:41:38,641 --> 00:41:40,201
Let's see if you
can make it back.

816
00:41:40,802 --> 00:41:42,536
Do you know who she is?

817
00:41:42,726 --> 00:41:44,486
She Madurai
Manivasagam's daughter.

818
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,560
That is a very violent
place by default.

819
00:41:47,298 --> 00:41:49,658
Talk anything against him and
they'll cut your tongue off.

820
00:41:50,261 --> 00:41:50,781
Now leave!

821
00:41:51,368 --> 00:41:53,448
Fine, I'll call you after
I get the girl. Come on.

822
00:41:56,882 --> 00:41:57,962
Take care of my parents.

823
00:41:59,906 --> 00:42:01,585
They'll start looking for
me at early morning 3.

824
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:02,460
Manage them.

825
00:42:02,485 --> 00:42:04,885
Keep me informed about every
details in the marriage hall.

826
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:06,238
Do you really have to do this?

827
00:42:06,263 --> 00:42:07,463
Do you really have to go?

828
00:42:07,582 --> 00:42:08,942
Can't we handle these rogues?

829
00:42:09,382 --> 00:42:11,422
Whatever I am doing is
to keep things smooth.

830
00:42:11,447 --> 00:42:12,857
Only a fool would
fight at this hour.

831
00:42:12,882 --> 00:42:14,552
Just do what I say.

832
00:42:15,136 --> 00:42:15,736
Get lost!

833
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:17,510
Excuse me!

834
00:42:18,378 --> 00:42:20,298
What time does the bus
to Madurai start?

835
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:22,618
Today is an auspicious day.

836
00:42:22,643 --> 00:42:24,483
There goes the last bus.
Go board it.

837
00:42:24,894 --> 00:42:25,614
Here, hold it.

838
00:42:26,026 --> 00:42:27,066
- See you.
- Be careful.

839
00:42:28,415 --> 00:42:31,735
Thanjavur, Trichy, Madurai!

840
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,720
Stop the bus!

841
00:42:33,797 --> 00:42:34,437
Where to?

842
00:42:34,928 --> 00:42:35,848
One ticket to Trichy.

843
00:42:35,873 --> 00:42:36,553
Give it.

844
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,040
Please give me change.

845
00:42:38,065 --> 00:42:38,945
Here.

846
00:42:39,299 --> 00:42:40,939
Are you going to Madurai?

847
00:42:41,167 --> 00:42:42,487
- Yes.
- Where in Madurai?

848
00:42:43,132 --> 00:42:43,932
Near Madurai bus stand.

849
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,560
Look at him and his witty joke!

850
00:42:46,117 --> 00:42:46,677
Boss...

851
00:42:47,614 --> 00:42:48,746
what is Madurai famous for?

852
00:42:48,771 --> 00:42:50,171
Madurai itself is very famous.

853
00:42:50,333 --> 00:42:51,253
I know that.

854
00:42:51,787 --> 00:42:53,395
What else is Madurai famous for?

855
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:54,860
Madurai Meenakshi Amman temple.

856
00:42:54,885 --> 00:42:56,405
Jigarthanda.

857
00:42:56,435 --> 00:42:57,795
Jasmine flowers.

858
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:59,444
Bull taming sport.

859
00:42:59,469 --> 00:43:02,959
Our chief Manivasagam too
is famous in Madurai.

860
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:05,120
Greetings brother.

861
00:43:05,145 --> 00:43:06,905
Do you have a seat
free next to you?

862
00:43:18,964 --> 00:43:21,084
How are you buddy?

863
00:43:21,224 --> 00:43:22,003
I'm fine. How are you?

864
00:43:22,028 --> 00:43:23,028
I'm also fine.

865
00:43:23,315 --> 00:43:25,997
There is a function in my family hence
couldn't make it to your sister's marriage.

866
00:43:26,022 --> 00:43:26,671
So what?

867
00:43:26,696 --> 00:43:29,256
I'll invite your sister and her
husband here and arrange a feast.

868
00:43:30,332 --> 00:43:31,412
Please don't be furious.

869
00:43:32,031 --> 00:43:32,871
No problem.

870
00:43:33,407 --> 00:43:34,727
I'm at Madurai. Where are you?

871
00:43:34,784 --> 00:43:35,864
What?!

872
00:43:35,889 --> 00:43:37,809
What are you doing here?

873
00:43:56,394 --> 00:43:58,133
Buddy, where are you now?

874
00:43:58,855 --> 00:43:59,812
At Maatudhavani bus stand.

875
00:43:59,837 --> 00:44:01,477
Look around you.

876
00:44:01,502 --> 00:44:05,025
All the banners with huge
writings that you see...

877
00:44:05,050 --> 00:44:06,690
it's all about him.

878
00:44:09,435 --> 00:44:10,955
He is a big shot.

879
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:14,190
It's impossible to even steal
a pen from his house.

880
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:15,812
I understand that.

881
00:44:16,356 --> 00:44:17,996
Try to understand
my situation too.

882
00:44:18,021 --> 00:44:19,661
In four hours my sister
is going to get married.

883
00:44:20,578 --> 00:44:21,578
Buddy!

884
00:44:21,603 --> 00:44:23,403
More than missing my
sister's marriage...

885
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:26,400
it's important that there shouldn't
be any problems at her wedding.

886
00:44:26,425 --> 00:44:27,585
Just do me a favour.

887
00:44:28,356 --> 00:44:29,756
I want to meet that girl in person.

888
00:44:29,781 --> 00:44:31,181
And just take a
picture with her.

889
00:44:31,528 --> 00:44:32,408
Rest I'll handle.

890
00:44:32,433 --> 00:44:33,993
All you need is a
picture with her?

891
00:44:35,268 --> 00:44:36,148
Ok buddy.

892
00:44:36,375 --> 00:44:39,255
My friend works as a
driver at her house.

893
00:44:39,545 --> 00:44:42,745
Let me talk to him
and get back to you.

894
00:44:42,770 --> 00:44:43,650
Make it quick.

895
00:44:48,611 --> 00:44:50,040
That is yesterday's newspaper.

896
00:44:50,065 --> 00:44:51,545
Today's paper is yet to arrive.

897
00:44:51,702 --> 00:44:52,782
I know today's headlines.

898
00:44:53,198 --> 00:44:54,678
I need yesterday's newspaper.

899
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:17,335
Hey Keera.

900
00:45:17,875 --> 00:45:18,867
Where is Shiva?

901
00:45:18,892 --> 00:45:20,212
Why isn't he attending my call?

902
00:45:20,528 --> 00:45:22,703
He was there in the kitchen. I
guess he must be serving food now.

903
00:45:22,728 --> 00:45:25,288
I’m going to slap you Keera. Weren't you
suppose to take care of the catering?

904
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:26,613
Then what is he doing there?
Call him.

905
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:27,260
I shall.

906
00:45:27,408 --> 00:45:29,075
Idiot, drinks too much
and delays everything.

907
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:29,940
Wait, I'll be back.

908
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:32,260
Welcome.

909
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:33,505
- Listen.
- Tell me.

910
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:34,290
Where is our son?

911
00:45:34,702 --> 00:45:35,880
He is missing since night.

912
00:45:35,905 --> 00:45:37,294
Why are you so tensed?

913
00:45:37,319 --> 00:45:39,239
His friends are here. He
must be welcoming them.

914
00:45:39,264 --> 00:45:40,384
He'll come. You carry on.

915
00:45:40,823 --> 00:45:42,343
The priest is calling. Now go.

916
00:45:42,581 --> 00:45:43,301
I am coming.

917
00:45:46,556 --> 00:45:48,356
Buddy, I spoke to my friend.

918
00:45:48,381 --> 00:45:51,261
Looks like Bharathi is at
some function in her college.

919
00:45:51,326 --> 00:45:53,966
If you go there, you can meet her
and take a picture with her.

920
00:46:38,823 --> 00:46:39,543
Hi friends.

921
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:42,030
Today, our very own,

922
00:46:42,055 --> 00:46:44,792
the daughter of well
known Mr. Manivasagam...

923
00:46:44,817 --> 00:46:45,909
Ms. Bharathi Manivasagam...

924
00:46:45,934 --> 00:46:47,854
is going to recite
a poem for us all.

925
00:46:50,004 --> 00:46:50,804
Are you ready?

926
00:46:51,149 --> 00:46:52,549
- Yes! We are!
- Indeed!

927
00:47:27,882 --> 00:47:29,202
Come on. Go ahead.

928
00:47:31,413 --> 00:47:32,853
With the turban on your head...

929
00:47:32,878 --> 00:47:34,318
- What the...
- Time to wind up!

930
00:47:34,343 --> 00:47:35,103
Who was that?

931
00:47:42,345 --> 00:47:44,185
With the turban on your head...

932
00:47:44,509 --> 00:47:45,869
What's with the turban?

933
00:47:46,426 --> 00:47:47,066
Who is that?

934
00:47:47,772 --> 00:47:48,772
Come on talk now!

935
00:47:55,666 --> 00:47:58,546
Ok that is enough.
Get down from there.

936
00:47:58,571 --> 00:48:00,691
Don't screw it up further.
Just get out from the dias.

937
00:48:01,033 --> 00:48:02,833
Bharathi, come on. Get down.

938
00:48:02,858 --> 00:48:04,858
Bharathi! Come on.

939
00:48:04,883 --> 00:48:06,443
- Enough!
- I swear you guys...

940
00:48:08,246 --> 00:48:11,412
I told you, reciting a poem on the
dias is not so easy.

941
00:48:11,437 --> 00:48:13,157
She thought it was a walk in the park.

942
00:48:13,410 --> 00:48:14,451
You need guts to do that.

943
00:48:14,476 --> 00:48:17,556
If you had been here in a politician makeover
like your dad, then it might have worked.

944
00:48:17,581 --> 00:48:20,061
Looks like the microphone is
only made for the politicians.

945
00:48:20,324 --> 00:48:21,564
It let's us down every time.

946
00:48:21,589 --> 00:48:24,989
Next performance by Selva and team
from Madurai American college.

947
00:48:28,568 --> 00:48:29,488
Wait. Hold on.

948
00:48:33,058 --> 00:48:33,778
Come on now...

949
00:48:34,203 --> 00:48:35,435
how can you not recite
a poem after carrying

950
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:36,663
the name of Bharathi
(a famous Tamil Poet)?

951
00:48:40,039 --> 00:48:42,214
It is not an insult to you but
to the great poet Bharathi.

952
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:42,959
Now come on.

953
00:48:58,296 --> 00:48:59,016
Hi friends.

954
00:48:59,563 --> 00:49:01,963
You just enjoyed a
western song and dance.

955
00:49:02,223 --> 00:49:04,115
You not only cheered them
up but also raised hell.

956
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:05,100
Excellent! Awesome!

957
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:07,820
But this here, is a
girl from our native.

958
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:09,286
That too a Madurai girl.

959
00:49:09,311 --> 00:49:10,911
Bharathi, same name
as the famous poet.

960
00:49:10,936 --> 00:49:14,923
She is going to recite a beautiful poem about our poet
Bharathiayar in our own beautiful Tamil language.

961
00:49:14,948 --> 00:49:16,345
So how about it?

962
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:17,250
Are you ready?

963
00:49:17,408 --> 00:49:18,928
We are read if she can
properly recite it.

964
00:49:18,953 --> 00:49:20,393
She will boss. So are you ready?

965
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:21,420
So friends?

966
00:49:21,598 --> 00:49:23,078
- How about it?
- Hell yeah!

967
00:49:23,103 --> 00:49:23,783
Get set go!

968
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:24,850
Start.

969
00:49:27,732 --> 00:49:28,412
Come on start.

970
00:49:28,776 --> 00:49:30,016
Shall I give you the push?

971
00:49:30,534 --> 00:49:33,454
With the turban on your head;
my dear brave poet Bharathi...

972
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:41,069
Just give me a sign...

973
00:49:41,308 --> 00:49:44,588
and I shall follow
you like a shadow.

974
00:49:45,309 --> 00:49:47,869
Just tell me what do you wish for...

975
00:49:48,077 --> 00:49:51,397
and I'll make it my order.

976
00:49:52,437 --> 00:49:56,317
You are a brave man; the one who
doesn't hold back your love...

977
00:49:56,342 --> 00:49:59,062
and so I am attracted to you.

978
00:49:59,522 --> 00:50:03,242
Nothing to be said or done...

979
00:50:03,267 --> 00:50:06,547
I feel you are the one for me.

980
00:50:06,643 --> 00:50:12,043
You stole my heart away and
replaced it with loads of love.

981
00:50:16,074 --> 00:50:17,194
Wow! You just sung it.

982
00:50:18,907 --> 00:50:20,067
Is it Bharathiyar's song?

983
00:50:23,373 --> 00:50:24,173
Bharathi's song.

984
00:50:26,716 --> 00:50:27,744
Fine. Proceed.

985
00:50:32,025 --> 00:50:34,825
Just give me a sign...

986
00:50:35,031 --> 00:50:38,718
and I shall follow
you like a shadow.

987
00:50:38,743 --> 00:50:42,063
Just tell me what
do you wish for...

988
00:50:42,204 --> 00:50:45,604
and I'll make it my order.

989
00:50:46,071 --> 00:50:49,871
You are a brave man; the one who
doesn't hold back your love...

990
00:50:49,896 --> 00:50:52,816
and so I am attracted to you.

991
00:50:53,215 --> 00:50:56,775
Nothing to be said or done...

992
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:00,400
I feel you are the one for me.

993
00:51:00,425 --> 00:51:07,505
You stole my heart away and
replaced it with loads of love.

994
00:51:21,582 --> 00:51:25,782
Thoughts about you keep flowing
in my mind all the time...

995
00:51:25,807 --> 00:51:28,847
The love keeps
blooming day by day.

996
00:51:28,872 --> 00:51:32,681
Every time I think about
your sweet smile...

997
00:51:32,706 --> 00:51:35,666
it drives me crazy.

998
00:51:35,691 --> 00:51:39,171
The way you impress me
with your talks...

999
00:51:39,196 --> 00:51:43,036
leaves me awestruck.

1000
00:51:43,061 --> 00:51:46,421
I don't care about time anymore.
[Hasan MRp @ Alpha13 MediaWorks]

1001
00:51:46,453 --> 00:51:49,387
Call me and I shall
come running to you.

1002
00:51:49,412 --> 00:51:53,410
You made me fall for
you in a jiffy....

1003
00:51:53,435 --> 00:51:57,155
It felt like the sweet sun light falling
upon me during the cold winter.

1004
00:51:57,180 --> 00:52:04,140
I am flying high and
it feels so blissful!

1005
00:52:04,165 --> 00:52:07,138
Just give me a sign...

1006
00:52:07,163 --> 00:52:10,325
and I shall follow
you like a shadow.

1007
00:52:10,350 --> 00:52:14,349
Just tell me what
do you wish for...

1008
00:52:14,374 --> 00:52:18,414
and I'll make it my order.

1009
00:52:38,759 --> 00:52:42,825
You are so tall,
dark and handsome...

1010
00:52:42,904 --> 00:52:45,864
and it mesmerizes me.

1011
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:50,927
Your smartness has won my heart...

1012
00:52:50,952 --> 00:52:53,832
it has left me wondering.

1013
00:52:53,857 --> 00:53:00,902
Even the smallest of distance
between us hurts me.

1014
00:53:00,927 --> 00:53:07,386
The love in your eyes
has left me sleepless.

1015
00:53:07,411 --> 00:53:11,491
My heart went bezerk the
moment I laid eyes on you.

1016
00:53:11,516 --> 00:53:15,092
It's magic and I
cannot explain it.

1017
00:53:15,117 --> 00:53:22,117
I will treasure you
in my heart forever.

1018
00:53:24,061 --> 00:53:27,021
Just give me a sign...

1019
00:53:27,046 --> 00:53:31,126
and I shall follow
you like a shadow.

1020
00:53:31,151 --> 00:53:34,271
Just tell me what
do you wish for...

1021
00:53:34,296 --> 00:53:40,056
and I'll make it my order.

1022
00:53:48,933 --> 00:53:49,973
Where did he go?

1023
00:53:49,998 --> 00:53:51,264
He went out attending
to someone's call.

1024
00:53:51,289 --> 00:53:54,009
I've heard such claps
only during my birthdays.

1025
00:53:54,611 --> 00:53:55,411
Hey Keera...

1026
00:53:56,085 --> 00:53:57,675
I hope everything is alright.

1027
00:54:00,061 --> 00:54:03,061
Ok, manage things over there. I've seen the
girl. I'll take a picture with her and return.

1028
00:54:03,141 --> 00:54:04,610
- Ok buddy.
- Give me the phone Keera.

1029
00:54:04,901 --> 00:54:05,581
Hello.

1030
00:54:05,719 --> 00:54:06,319
Bro!

1031
00:54:08,470 --> 00:54:09,110
Kavi...

1032
00:54:09,914 --> 00:54:11,274
How are you Ms. Bride?

1033
00:54:11,579 --> 00:54:12,179
Forget that.

1034
00:54:12,414 --> 00:54:13,174
Where are you?

1035
00:54:13,647 --> 00:54:14,687
Is there any problem?

1036
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:15,680
Nothing.

1037
00:54:16,518 --> 00:54:17,318
Nothing like that.

1038
00:54:17,722 --> 00:54:21,602
Who was he? He dragged you to
the stage and you too obliged.

1039
00:54:21,969 --> 00:54:22,820
He is my boyfriend.

1040
00:54:22,845 --> 00:54:23,565
Boyfriend?

1041
00:54:24,238 --> 00:54:25,782
The guy with the dimple cheeks?

1042
00:54:25,807 --> 00:54:27,287
Exactly!

1043
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:29,220
You are missing since the night.

1044
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:30,120
Where are you?

1045
00:54:31,072 --> 00:54:32,992
If you don't reach now,
I'll halt the marriage.

1046
00:54:33,017 --> 00:54:33,718
I'm telling you!

1047
00:54:33,743 --> 00:54:35,903
I'm on my way. So be ready Ms.
Bride.

1048
00:54:36,528 --> 00:54:37,109
Make it fast.

1049
00:54:37,134 --> 00:54:39,214
I'll be there when the groom
ties the knot to you.

1050
00:54:39,239 --> 00:54:40,023
I promise.

1051
00:54:40,048 --> 00:54:41,408
Do you know what
is he up to now?

1052
00:54:41,433 --> 00:54:42,033
What?

1053
00:54:42,187 --> 00:54:43,187
He is drafting a plan.

1054
00:54:43,761 --> 00:54:44,321
A plan?

1055
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:45,307
Obviously.

1056
00:54:45,332 --> 00:54:48,012
It's not so easy to elope with
Madurai Manivasagam's daughter.

1057
00:54:48,188 --> 00:54:50,471
I guess he is calling all his
friends and alerting them.

1058
00:54:50,496 --> 00:54:52,336
You mean like the Mask of Zorro?

1059
00:54:52,361 --> 00:54:54,121
Better than that!

1060
00:54:56,049 --> 00:54:57,653
Do you know why he looks upset?

1061
00:54:57,703 --> 00:54:58,183
Why?

1062
00:54:58,208 --> 00:55:00,246
He found out that I'm getting
married in two months.

1063
00:55:00,552 --> 00:55:01,512
- That is why.
- Ok

1064
00:55:05,009 --> 00:55:05,849
Now wait and watch...

1065
00:55:06,317 --> 00:55:09,677
He will call me
aside and propose.

1066
00:55:10,818 --> 00:55:11,736
Excuse me.

1067
00:55:11,761 --> 00:55:12,481
See I told you.

1068
00:55:12,506 --> 00:55:13,866
What are you going
to do about it?

1069
00:55:13,891 --> 00:55:14,731
I'm going to elope.

1070
00:55:14,756 --> 00:55:15,396
When?

1071
00:55:15,619 --> 00:55:16,499
Not right away.

1072
00:55:17,409 --> 00:55:19,849
He made me wait desperately
for two months.

1073
00:55:20,497 --> 00:55:21,817
Let him wait for half an hour.

1074
00:55:23,096 --> 00:55:23,896
How about a selfie?

1075
00:55:23,921 --> 00:55:24,601
Come on now...

1076
00:55:24,708 --> 00:55:28,508
let's all leave. If we are seen along with
her then people will think we are crazy too!

1077
00:55:28,791 --> 00:55:29,391
Yes. Come on.

1078
00:55:29,416 --> 00:55:30,016
Let's leave.

1079
00:55:30,742 --> 00:55:31,342
Come on.

1080
00:56:22,513 --> 00:56:23,233
What is it?

1081
00:56:23,621 --> 00:56:26,415
Are you afraid of me;
the minister's wife?

1082
00:56:26,447 --> 00:56:27,160
Yes mam.

1083
00:56:27,185 --> 00:56:27,790
Don't be.

1084
00:56:27,815 --> 00:56:28,972
Be cool.

1085
00:56:29,686 --> 00:56:30,526
What about you?

1086
00:56:30,551 --> 00:56:31,265
No. I'm not afraid of you.

1087
00:56:31,290 --> 00:56:32,010
Oh my god!

1088
00:56:32,211 --> 00:56:34,531
You must be! After all
I'm minister's wife.

1089
00:56:34,608 --> 00:56:35,608
But not now.

1090
00:56:35,633 --> 00:56:36,593
Because I said so.

1091
00:56:36,618 --> 00:56:37,538
Be brave and cool.

1092
00:56:37,563 --> 00:56:38,163
Ok mam.

1093
00:56:38,886 --> 00:56:41,385
Looks like they are getting nervous.
After all I'm minister's wife.

1094
00:56:41,410 --> 00:56:42,213
You leave. I'll take care.

1095
00:56:42,238 --> 00:56:42,767
Ok madam.

1096
00:56:43,935 --> 00:56:44,627
Does it look good?

1097
00:56:44,652 --> 00:56:45,292
Come on tell me.

1098
00:56:45,457 --> 00:56:46,177
It is good.

1099
00:56:49,059 --> 00:56:49,619
Bharathi.

1100
00:56:50,854 --> 00:56:51,892
My daughter will be
here any minute.

1101
00:56:51,917 --> 00:56:53,237
Bharathi, just a minute.

1102
00:56:53,262 --> 00:56:55,306
- Bharathi!
- I would prefer it with more diamond stones.

1103
00:56:55,331 --> 00:56:55,771
Mom!

1104
00:56:55,796 --> 00:56:57,316
Hey Bharathi.

1105
00:56:57,874 --> 00:57:00,474
The designs here are really awesome.
Lot of new collections.

1106
00:57:01,622 --> 00:57:03,502
Show me that one.

1107
00:57:03,527 --> 00:57:04,487
What do you want sir?

1108
00:57:04,859 --> 00:57:05,659
Water

1109
00:57:06,019 --> 00:57:07,019
Ok sir. Please have it.

1110
00:57:07,317 --> 00:57:09,653
Everyone here are afraid of us.

1111
00:57:09,678 --> 00:57:10,838
After all we are
minister's family.

1112
00:57:10,863 --> 00:57:11,903
It's so much fun though.

1113
00:57:20,074 --> 00:57:21,114
One minute.

1114
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:24,500
Just a picture.

1115
00:57:40,006 --> 00:57:40,646
Come here.

1116
00:57:41,024 --> 00:57:41,624
A little more.

1117
00:57:42,618 --> 00:57:43,218
Some water?

1118
00:57:43,485 --> 00:57:44,285
No thanks.

1119
00:57:44,572 --> 00:57:45,492
Fine. Leave it.

1120
00:57:45,991 --> 00:57:46,551
Tell me.

1121
00:57:46,727 --> 00:57:48,367
How did you turn so brave now?

1122
00:57:49,505 --> 00:57:50,465
Nothing like that.

1123
00:57:50,871 --> 00:57:52,111
I'm still having fear inside.

1124
00:57:52,692 --> 00:57:55,212
But then your eyes and
lips are expressing it.

1125
00:57:55,355 --> 00:57:56,515
So go ahead. Let me hear it.

1126
00:57:57,652 --> 00:57:58,492
Well, I want to...

1127
00:57:58,566 --> 00:57:59,166
You want to...

1128
00:57:59,961 --> 00:58:00,841
I want to...

1129
00:58:01,175 --> 00:58:02,344
You want to...?

1130
00:58:03,162 --> 00:58:04,766
When you sang that
song it the college...

1131
00:58:04,791 --> 00:58:05,991
you were just awesome.

1132
00:58:07,053 --> 00:58:09,213
I've become your fan. Can I
take a picture with you?

1133
00:58:12,021 --> 00:58:14,178
A picture? Is that all you need?

1134
00:58:14,866 --> 00:58:17,106
Will you live your whole
life with that memory?

1135
00:58:17,131 --> 00:58:18,931
So how about 4 - 5 pictures.
That'll do.

1136
00:58:18,956 --> 00:58:20,185
Come on, let's take a selfie.

1137
00:58:20,210 --> 00:58:21,050
No way.

1138
00:58:21,835 --> 00:58:24,235
We'll make an whole
picture album of ours.

1139
00:58:24,730 --> 00:58:25,290
Take it.

1140
00:58:27,625 --> 00:58:28,265
Take it?

1141
00:58:28,593 --> 00:58:29,513
What does she mean?

1142
00:58:29,538 --> 00:58:31,258
Now stop answering
like a delivery boy.

1143
00:58:31,283 --> 00:58:32,243
Where is she?

1144
00:58:32,561 --> 00:58:34,081
She just went to
inform her mother.

1145
00:58:34,295 --> 00:58:35,682
What? She is ready to
elope with permission?

1146
00:58:35,707 --> 00:58:36,867
Sounds crazy!

1147
00:58:37,401 --> 00:58:38,041
Mom!

1148
00:58:38,285 --> 00:58:40,165
Remember the guy I
fell in love with?

1149
00:58:40,190 --> 00:58:41,894
He is here. I'm
eloping with him.

1150
00:58:41,919 --> 00:58:42,519
Who is he?

1151
00:58:42,704 --> 00:58:44,864
You mean the guy with
the dimple cheeks?

1152
00:58:44,889 --> 00:58:45,449
Where is he?

1153
00:58:45,532 --> 00:58:46,052
There.

1154
00:58:46,885 --> 00:58:47,765
He looks smart.

1155
00:58:48,089 --> 00:58:48,769
Hi.

1156
00:58:49,462 --> 00:58:50,102
All the best.

1157
00:58:50,127 --> 00:58:50,767
Hi.

1158
00:58:52,595 --> 00:58:55,561
Well fine. Before eloping don't forget
to bid good bye to your grandma.

1159
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:58,999
Excuse me, where is the jewelry
I asked you to show me.

1160
00:59:07,587 --> 00:59:08,347
It's nice.

1161
00:59:09,368 --> 00:59:10,168
I mean the tea.

1162
00:59:11,532 --> 00:59:13,932
Our chief is out of town. His
mom his here though. Come in.

1163
00:59:15,032 --> 00:59:15,752
Greetings.

1164
00:59:15,777 --> 00:59:17,217
It's my daughter's marriage.

1165
00:59:17,532 --> 00:59:19,132
So I'm here to invite.

1166
00:59:19,751 --> 00:59:20,711
Is it?

1167
00:59:20,885 --> 00:59:21,705
Please do come.

1168
00:59:21,871 --> 00:59:23,351
So you are here to invite?

1169
00:59:23,611 --> 00:59:26,891
I thought you all came here finding out
that my grand daughter is about to elope.

1170
00:59:27,008 --> 00:59:28,568
This is the guy she
is eloping with.

1171
00:59:28,593 --> 00:59:30,033
She is just kidding. Don't mind.

1172
00:59:38,423 --> 00:59:39,103
Well it's...

1173
00:59:39,128 --> 00:59:40,088
I'm ready. Let's leave.

1174
00:59:40,717 --> 00:59:41,437
We shall leave.

1175
00:59:43,418 --> 00:59:44,658
Come on. Let's leave.

1176
00:59:46,487 --> 00:59:48,367
I hope every one at
your home are normal.

1177
00:59:48,622 --> 00:59:49,422
Yes they are.

1178
00:59:51,018 --> 00:59:53,018
The old lady keeps pestering us.
Where were you?

1179
00:59:53,043 --> 00:59:54,480
Everyone in the town is attending
the speech conference.

1180
00:59:54,505 --> 00:59:55,825
Did he get in knowing that?

1181
00:59:55,850 --> 00:59:57,090
Go and do something about it.

1182
00:59:57,115 --> 00:59:57,915
Give me that.

1183
00:59:57,940 --> 00:59:59,500
How dare he?

1184
00:59:59,588 --> 01:00:00,788
We must not spare him!

1185
01:00:01,401 --> 01:00:03,681
Where is the guy who wants to
take away our chief's daughter?

1186
01:00:03,706 --> 01:00:04,386
Hold on.

1187
01:00:04,411 --> 01:00:06,348
I thought the old
lady was blabbering.

1188
01:00:06,373 --> 01:00:07,973
But her grand daughter
came down all set.

1189
01:00:07,998 --> 01:00:09,528
Let's go finish him.

1190
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:10,197
Not here.

1191
01:00:10,222 --> 01:00:12,876
Let him step out and we
shall finish him off there.

1192
01:00:12,901 --> 01:00:16,056
No. Don't try to stop me.
I'll finish him off!

1193
01:00:16,081 --> 01:00:18,564
- Come on. Let's leave.
- Bharathi...

1194
01:00:19,063 --> 01:00:19,703
One minute.

1195
01:00:21,106 --> 01:00:22,642
Granny...

1196
01:00:22,667 --> 01:00:23,987
can you hand me that pen?

1197
01:00:24,461 --> 01:00:26,061
When I can hand her
over to you...

1198
01:00:26,196 --> 01:00:27,636
won't I hand this pen to you?

1199
01:00:30,127 --> 01:00:31,088
That was a good one.

1200
01:00:31,175 --> 01:00:31,978
Come on.

1201
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:33,319
Let's leave.

1202
01:00:34,031 --> 01:00:34,671
Bharathi...

1203
01:00:36,771 --> 01:00:39,211
can he even cross our
street along with you?

1204
01:00:39,746 --> 01:00:42,226
If it was impossible he
wouldn't have come here.

1205
01:00:42,556 --> 01:00:43,076
Bye.

1206
01:00:43,174 --> 01:00:43,774
Take care.

1207
01:00:54,790 --> 01:00:55,830
What happened?

1208
01:00:56,064 --> 01:00:57,064
Come on let's leave.

1209
01:00:58,941 --> 01:00:59,701
Let's leave!

1210
01:01:09,375 --> 01:01:10,255
What happened?

1211
01:01:10,442 --> 01:01:11,162
We'll elope...

1212
01:01:11,428 --> 01:01:13,348
- but before that, how about a selfie?
- Sure!

1213
01:01:19,010 --> 01:01:21,490
Now what are they doing
taking pictures?

1214
01:01:25,582 --> 01:01:26,422
- Buddy.
- Tell me.

1215
01:01:26,751 --> 01:01:28,511
David's men have started
creating ruckus.

1216
01:01:28,536 --> 01:01:30,216
Two of their men came
into the hall drunk...

1217
01:01:30,241 --> 01:01:33,001
and when Selva confronted
them, they thrashed him.

1218
01:01:33,026 --> 01:01:34,056
Look at him.

1219
01:01:34,963 --> 01:01:36,479
One min. Wait here.

1220
01:01:36,504 --> 01:01:37,464
Ok.

1221
01:01:37,859 --> 01:01:38,779
What happened?

1222
01:01:38,804 --> 01:01:39,884
I hope everything
is moving smooth.

1223
01:01:39,909 --> 01:01:40,885
Everything is running
smooth but...

1224
01:01:40,910 --> 01:01:43,159
dad has sensed out the issue.

1225
01:01:43,184 --> 01:01:45,704
There is no use trying to hide it from him.
You talk to him.

1226
01:01:45,729 --> 01:01:46,457
Hey Keera!

1227
01:01:46,482 --> 01:01:49,442
I'll come soon. Don't hand it over to dad.
Listen to me.

1228
01:01:49,467 --> 01:01:51,097
I'm fine. Please have your food.

1229
01:01:51,122 --> 01:01:52,242
It's Shiva...

1230
01:01:52,812 --> 01:01:53,543
Look here...

1231
01:01:53,583 --> 01:01:56,903
my son keeps me informed
if there is anything.

1232
01:01:57,022 --> 01:01:58,814
But this time he has
failed to do so...

1233
01:01:58,839 --> 01:02:01,279
that too at this very important
hour of his sister's marriage.

1234
01:02:01,379 --> 01:02:03,979
That means someone who has
trusted him is in deep trouble.

1235
01:02:04,203 --> 01:02:04,883
Look here...

1236
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:07,040
We should never let down
the ones who trusts us.

1237
01:02:07,667 --> 01:02:10,347
Ask him to finish of his
work to perfection and...

1238
01:02:10,494 --> 01:02:12,734
then call me to my
mobile and I shall talk.

1239
01:03:26,936 --> 01:03:27,656
Come on!

1240
01:03:41,357 --> 01:03:42,877
If still anyone is
brave enough...

1241
01:03:43,644 --> 01:03:44,484
come, let's fight!

1242
01:04:59,820 --> 01:05:01,380
Who is he? Where is he from?

1243
01:05:01,699 --> 01:05:03,764
Just knock him down!

1244
01:05:03,789 --> 01:05:05,029
Now stop it!

1245
01:05:05,054 --> 01:05:06,734
He is busting up
all our men here!

1246
01:05:10,813 --> 01:05:11,733
What!?

1247
01:05:12,460 --> 01:05:13,580
Wait I'm on my way.

1248
01:05:13,605 --> 01:05:14,485
I'll be there soon.

1249
01:05:23,134 --> 01:05:24,334
Where are you?

1250
01:05:24,451 --> 01:05:26,091
I'm on my way with my men.

1251
01:05:26,291 --> 01:05:27,611
Forget it.

1252
01:05:27,639 --> 01:05:30,359
He knows where we all are.
So he is on his way!

1253
01:05:30,947 --> 01:05:32,867
Tell me where is he now?

1254
01:05:41,692 --> 01:05:43,198
- Brother!
- Was it him?

1255
01:05:43,223 --> 01:05:43,776
Greetings.

1256
01:05:43,801 --> 01:05:47,241
Our chief Manivasagam too
is famous in Madurai.

1257
01:05:47,266 --> 01:05:48,186
Greetings!

1258
01:06:00,566 --> 01:06:03,314
If they find out that I had explained him
everything about us, I'll be finished!

1259
01:06:03,339 --> 01:06:04,322
Come on now!

1260
01:06:04,347 --> 01:06:05,667
Come on everybody.

1261
01:06:23,020 --> 01:06:24,396
Let go of her!

1262
01:06:26,719 --> 01:06:28,239
Hey! Why did you do that?

1263
01:06:28,264 --> 01:06:28,984
What's the time?

1264
01:06:29,925 --> 01:06:30,405
10 a.m.

1265
01:06:30,657 --> 01:06:31,617
Tell me the exact time.

1266
01:06:33,184 --> 01:06:34,184
9:58 a.m

1267
01:06:34,928 --> 01:06:36,448
Come on now! Come on every body!

1268
01:06:48,856 --> 01:06:50,421
What will be the
reaction to this?

1269
01:06:50,446 --> 01:06:54,686
The news will spread that you came to Madurai
and took away Manivasagam's daughter with you.

1270
01:06:59,309 --> 01:06:59,869
Now?

1271
01:07:00,895 --> 01:07:04,442
The news will spread that you came to Madurai
and eloped with Manivasagam's daughter.

1272
01:07:16,344 --> 01:07:17,504
You must be a foodie!

1273
01:07:17,835 --> 01:07:19,081
You said the stagnant
water is electrocuted?

1274
01:07:19,106 --> 01:07:20,666
But look at him walk through it!

1275
01:07:38,907 --> 01:07:39,547
Buddy!

1276
01:07:39,923 --> 01:07:42,723
It was in the news that there will
be power outage from 9 to 10 a.m.

1277
01:07:43,886 --> 01:07:45,641
Stop wondering and
go catch them!

1278
01:07:54,878 --> 01:07:55,558
Awesome!

1279
01:07:55,645 --> 01:07:58,307
That is why he made
us roam around.

1280
01:07:58,445 --> 01:08:00,805
He is too clever
and quick witted!

1281
01:08:00,830 --> 01:08:01,470
Let's go?

1282
01:08:01,830 --> 01:08:03,630
How are we traveling?

1283
01:08:22,597 --> 01:08:25,790
He shouldn't cross the
limits of Madurai!

1284
01:08:46,008 --> 01:08:46,528
Chief!

1285
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:49,560
Check if it is
Manivasagam's daughter?

1286
01:08:54,096 --> 01:08:55,256
It's indeed her.

1287
01:08:55,641 --> 01:08:56,801
He did it!

1288
01:08:58,153 --> 01:08:59,673
Come on! Let's make a move!

1289
01:09:03,704 --> 01:09:04,304
Naga...

1290
01:09:05,214 --> 01:09:06,694
Naga, make a call to Madurai.

1291
01:09:06,967 --> 01:09:09,087
Call up and find out
what's happening there!

1292
01:09:23,527 --> 01:09:26,807
Our chief's daughter is abducted! It's
riot everywhere! So shut down the shop!

1293
01:09:36,850 --> 01:09:38,759
Don't spare any of the shops!

1294
01:09:38,784 --> 01:09:39,944
What's happening there?

1295
01:09:39,969 --> 01:09:41,209
Stop kidding!

1296
01:09:41,234 --> 01:09:43,194
Our chief's daughter has eloped!

1297
01:09:43,579 --> 01:09:44,613
Tell him she was abducted!

1298
01:09:44,638 --> 01:09:45,758
She was abducted.

1299
01:09:45,783 --> 01:09:48,943
We have set the whole
Madurai on fire!

1300
01:09:48,968 --> 01:09:51,448
We will burn it down into
ashes for our chief!

1301
01:09:51,473 --> 01:09:52,233
Set it on fire!

1302
01:09:54,873 --> 01:09:55,833
Call him up.

1303
01:09:56,273 --> 01:09:57,353
Call Shiva!

1304
01:09:57,956 --> 01:09:59,196
Put it on loudspeaker mode.

1305
01:10:04,354 --> 01:10:05,074
Where are you?

1306
01:10:05,371 --> 01:10:06,133
What's happening there?

1307
01:10:06,158 --> 01:10:07,040
What did you tell me David?

1308
01:10:07,065 --> 01:10:10,610
That this is a violent
place by default.

1309
01:10:11,416 --> 01:10:12,856
All that build up was a waste!

1310
01:10:13,267 --> 01:10:14,907
They are still living
in the past David.

1311
01:10:14,932 --> 01:10:17,732
They are still in the same old attire
and carrying the same old weapon...

1312
01:10:17,757 --> 01:10:20,277
and looking for me at the bus stand,
railway station and the freeway.

1313
01:10:20,302 --> 01:10:21,022
What can I do?

1314
01:10:21,047 --> 01:10:22,607
Don't they realize there
is an airport in Madurai?

1315
01:10:22,632 --> 01:10:23,432
Where is the girl?

1316
01:10:24,011 --> 01:10:25,971
She and my guts,
both are with me!

1317
01:10:26,425 --> 01:10:28,004
I'll call you in an hour,
after reaching there.

1318
01:10:28,029 --> 01:10:28,670
Take care.

1319
01:10:37,847 --> 01:10:39,456
Sorry. Sorry.

1320
01:10:39,834 --> 01:10:40,965
Sorry. Sorry.

1321
01:10:40,990 --> 01:10:41,790
No probs. No probs.

1322
01:10:48,370 --> 01:10:49,050
Now what?

1323
01:10:58,088 --> 01:10:58,648
Ok?

1324
01:11:02,066 --> 01:11:02,746
Awesome!

1325
01:11:04,189 --> 01:11:04,789
Let's go!

1326
01:11:47,434 --> 01:11:48,914
Where will you go now?

1327
01:11:50,274 --> 01:11:51,594
Sins committed by the parents...

1328
01:11:52,450 --> 01:11:53,610
affects their children.

1329
01:11:54,262 --> 01:11:55,406
So does the loans.

1330
01:11:56,032 --> 01:11:57,192
Is it 7 to 8 years now?

1331
01:11:57,938 --> 01:12:00,610
I remember when you and your dad
came to borrow money from my dad...

1332
01:12:00,635 --> 01:12:02,235
You looked so gorgeous.

1333
01:12:02,965 --> 01:12:04,485
Still, you look the same.

1334
01:12:04,510 --> 01:12:05,270
But now...

1335
01:12:05,857 --> 01:12:07,457
no one can question me.

1336
01:12:07,482 --> 01:12:11,507
She keeps escaping now and then.

1337
01:12:12,313 --> 01:12:13,873
Get up and get ready.

1338
01:12:17,176 --> 01:12:17,696
Dad...

1339
01:12:18,372 --> 01:12:18,972
tell me.

1340
01:12:20,290 --> 01:12:20,930
I'm still here.

1341
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:23,840
I'll check and call you back.

1342
01:12:25,787 --> 01:12:27,338
Isn't the registration
happening today?

1343
01:12:27,363 --> 01:12:29,163
You were busy and hence...

1344
01:12:44,093 --> 01:12:44,853
Tell me buddy.

1345
01:12:45,362 --> 01:12:46,442
Tell me. What's up?

1346
01:12:46,559 --> 01:12:47,669
Everything is fine here.

1347
01:12:47,694 --> 01:12:48,734
How's everything over there?

1348
01:12:48,759 --> 01:12:50,067
The rituals are done.

1349
01:12:50,092 --> 01:12:51,612
Other customs are in the procession..

1350
01:12:51,637 --> 01:12:54,130
Finally, everyone are
looking relieved.

1351
01:12:54,155 --> 01:12:55,583
The whole hall is
in a festive mood.

1352
01:12:56,248 --> 01:12:57,168
Come soon.

1353
01:12:57,330 --> 01:12:58,730
I hope there are
no other issues.

1354
01:12:58,755 --> 01:12:59,915
Nothing.

1355
01:13:00,155 --> 01:13:02,595
Senthil has taken Selva
to the hospital.

1356
01:13:03,836 --> 01:13:04,396
Kavitha?

1357
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:06,840
Dad?

1358
01:13:07,149 --> 01:13:09,229
Everyone are relieved and happy.

1359
01:13:09,825 --> 01:13:11,274
Most of them have left.

1360
01:13:11,299 --> 01:13:13,131
Only our and groom's
relatives are here.

1361
01:13:13,156 --> 01:13:13,821
Let them leave...

1362
01:13:14,172 --> 01:13:15,572
and then we'll take care of David.

1363
01:13:15,597 --> 01:13:16,145
Idiot!

1364
01:13:16,170 --> 01:13:16,810
Tell me.

1365
01:13:18,106 --> 01:13:19,946
Don't make any hasty decisions.

1366
01:13:20,246 --> 01:13:23,114
Everything is poised for a smooth
ending. I'll take care. You stay quite.

1367
01:13:23,229 --> 01:13:25,509
Listen! We shouldn't
spare them so easily.

1368
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:28,240
David is calling me. I'll call you back.

1369
01:13:32,689 --> 01:13:34,329
Why did you switch
off your mobile?

1370
01:13:34,354 --> 01:13:35,794
Guess you too are
living in the past.

1371
01:13:36,193 --> 01:13:38,961
We are suppose to switch off the
mobile in the plane. Don't you know?

1372
01:13:38,986 --> 01:13:39,906
Where are you now?

1373
01:13:40,346 --> 01:13:42,146
A small change in
the plan David.

1374
01:13:42,380 --> 01:13:43,780
As we stepped out of Madurai...

1375
01:13:43,805 --> 01:13:45,565
the immediate flight
was to Coimbatore.

1376
01:13:45,590 --> 01:13:47,230
We are now at Coimbatore.

1377
01:13:47,255 --> 01:13:49,895
So should we come to Kumbakonam
or wait here at Coimbatore?

1378
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:52,826
No one is so dedicated here.

1379
01:13:52,851 --> 01:13:53,651
But you...

1380
01:13:53,676 --> 01:13:56,316
you are doing what
I exactly want.

1381
01:13:56,889 --> 01:13:58,729
The real task for
you starts now.

1382
01:13:58,754 --> 01:13:59,691
So now take the girl...

1383
01:13:59,716 --> 01:14:00,276
David...

1384
01:14:01,128 --> 01:14:02,230
well now...

1385
01:14:02,255 --> 01:14:03,815
I messed up with you once.

1386
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:05,240
And now you messed up with me.

1387
01:14:05,362 --> 01:14:06,957
And I did what you
ordered me to do.

1388
01:14:06,982 --> 01:14:08,741
And that makes us even.

1389
01:14:08,766 --> 01:14:11,006
I won't dance to
your tunes anymore.

1390
01:14:11,246 --> 01:14:11,846
Got it?

1391
01:14:12,361 --> 01:14:15,238
Are you relieved that
the marriage is over?

1392
01:14:15,525 --> 01:14:17,840
If I had finished off someone at
the marriage hall yesterday...

1393
01:14:17,927 --> 01:14:21,207
it would have only been a small
hiccup in the proceedings.

1394
01:14:21,427 --> 01:14:23,507
But if I finish
someone off now...

1395
01:14:23,625 --> 01:14:25,625
it'll erupt as a volcano
in the whole family.

1396
01:14:25,967 --> 01:14:26,890
So don't you!

1397
01:14:26,915 --> 01:14:28,995
Don't let your sister's
happiest day turn into...

1398
01:14:30,074 --> 01:14:31,994
Don't make me complete
the sentence.

1399
01:14:33,488 --> 01:14:35,288
You are making the best
use of my situation.

1400
01:14:35,497 --> 01:14:36,097
Indeed!

1401
01:14:36,306 --> 01:14:37,386
What else did you think?

1402
01:14:37,430 --> 01:14:40,790
Such situations in your life is
a blessing for people like me.

1403
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:41,880
David...

1404
01:14:42,630 --> 01:14:45,069
when someone is looking to
settle things peacefully...

1405
01:14:45,094 --> 01:14:46,734
doesn't mean that
he can't battle.

1406
01:14:47,646 --> 01:14:49,966
It means that he is awaiting
a bigger battle to fight!

1407
01:14:50,608 --> 01:14:51,768
Tell me what to do now?

1408
01:14:51,793 --> 01:14:53,513
Wait for the big fight.

1409
01:14:54,573 --> 01:14:55,773
And one more thing...

1410
01:14:55,889 --> 01:14:58,609
You might have abducted the girl
from Madurai with your wits...

1411
01:14:58,634 --> 01:15:02,154
You have now arrived at her
fiance's destination.

1412
01:15:02,476 --> 01:15:03,996
Your wits won't work here.

1413
01:15:04,239 --> 01:15:08,399
He'll find and nab you
quicker than a CCTV footage.

1414
01:15:08,531 --> 01:15:09,365
David...

1415
01:15:09,389 --> 01:15:11,469
do you mind if I advise you?
It's for your benefit.

1416
01:15:11,494 --> 01:15:12,555
Shall I?

1417
01:15:13,432 --> 01:15:14,872
Stop boasting about others.

1418
01:15:14,897 --> 01:15:15,737
Come to the point.

1419
01:15:15,762 --> 01:15:17,162
Tell me what should I do now?

1420
01:15:21,982 --> 01:15:23,382
I'll call you in half an hour.

1421
01:15:23,502 --> 01:15:24,302
Hang up.

1422
01:15:29,832 --> 01:15:30,952
Are you done talking?

1423
01:15:33,872 --> 01:15:35,272
Do you know how I feel?

1424
01:15:35,297 --> 01:15:37,737
Just like a fish from an aquarium
has found it's way to the sea.

1425
01:15:37,762 --> 01:15:39,882
Just like a bird feels it's
wings for the first time.

1426
01:15:40,140 --> 01:15:41,140
I feel so great!

1427
01:15:41,165 --> 01:15:44,925
I feel like holding your
hands and running forever.

1428
01:15:45,127 --> 01:15:45,982
What do you say?

1429
01:15:46,007 --> 01:15:48,647
Hey crazy lover!

1430
01:15:48,672 --> 01:15:51,992
How did this ever happen?

1431
01:15:53,337 --> 01:15:56,137
No words exchanged....

1432
01:15:56,162 --> 01:15:59,442
yet my heart completely
understands you and only you.

1433
01:16:12,709 --> 01:16:14,909
Hey crazy lover!

1434
01:16:14,966 --> 01:16:17,486
How did this ever happen?

1435
01:16:18,259 --> 01:16:20,004
No words exchanged....

1436
01:16:20,029 --> 01:16:22,469
yet my heart completely
understands you and only you.

1437
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:26,793
Am I etched so deep in your heart?

1438
01:16:26,818 --> 01:16:29,498
Have you gone crazy in love?

1439
01:16:29,975 --> 01:16:32,895
Just like the opposite
poles of a magnet...

1440
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:35,379
why are we attracted
to each other?

1441
01:16:35,404 --> 01:16:38,316
Every time I hug you, my
heart jumps with joy.

1442
01:16:38,341 --> 01:16:42,016
We are meant to be each other's forever.

1443
01:16:46,747 --> 01:16:49,410
Hey crazy lover!

1444
01:16:49,435 --> 01:16:51,955
How did this ever happen?

1445
01:16:52,832 --> 01:16:55,232
No words exchanged....

1446
01:16:55,257 --> 01:16:58,177
yet my heart completely
understands you and only you.

1447
01:17:10,592 --> 01:17:16,403
Some kind of nostalgia is kicking in,
that I am unable to understand...

1448
01:17:16,428 --> 01:17:22,148
When you are not around, the
loneliness knocks me down.

1449
01:17:22,173 --> 01:17:28,093
I wish for a life
with you forever.

1450
01:17:28,118 --> 01:17:33,638
Every time I see you I go
speechless and breathless.

1451
01:17:33,663 --> 01:17:39,423
Every time you pass by, the whole
world starts rotating backwards.

1452
01:17:39,463 --> 01:17:47,512
I am all yours by
heart and by soul.

1453
01:17:47,666 --> 01:17:49,946
Yes I am!

1454
01:17:59,567 --> 01:18:05,297
Your love has filled me
up and made me strong.

1455
01:18:05,322 --> 01:18:11,282
Every time I try talking to you, my
shyness prevents me from doing so.

1456
01:18:11,307 --> 01:18:16,900
Love expresses more
through looks...

1457
01:18:16,925 --> 01:18:22,845
So let me give you the sign
that yearns for a kiss.

1458
01:18:22,870 --> 01:18:28,910
Love, it's a crazy feeling
and it's so exciting.

1459
01:18:28,935 --> 01:18:33,837
Love, it's an adrenaline
rush and it's so exciting.

1460
01:18:33,862 --> 01:18:36,742
So come to me, my love.

1461
01:18:36,767 --> 01:18:38,859
Hey crazy lover!

1462
01:18:38,884 --> 01:18:41,524
How did this ever happen?

1463
01:18:42,332 --> 01:18:44,692
No words exchanged....

1464
01:18:44,717 --> 01:18:47,157
yet my heart completely
understands you and only you.

1465
01:18:47,575 --> 01:18:50,495
Am I etched so deep in your heart?

1466
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:53,240
Have you gone crazy in love?

1467
01:18:54,012 --> 01:18:57,132
Just like the opposite
poles of a magnet...

1468
01:18:57,157 --> 01:18:59,383
why are we attracted
to each other?

1469
01:18:59,408 --> 01:19:02,248
Every time I hug you, my
heart jumps with joy.

1470
01:19:02,273 --> 01:19:09,593
We are meant to be
each other's forever.

1471
01:19:22,491 --> 01:19:25,211
We increased the treatment's
intensity based on your orders.

1472
01:19:25,533 --> 01:19:27,253
Maari died in the prison.

1473
01:19:27,786 --> 01:19:29,666
His brother in law will
be released tomorrow.

1474
01:19:29,691 --> 01:19:31,051
Why do you irritate me?

1475
01:19:32,291 --> 01:19:33,571
Stop explaining.

1476
01:19:33,596 --> 01:19:34,236
Get lost!

1477
01:20:36,985 --> 01:20:38,185
Did you say something?

1478
01:20:39,056 --> 01:20:39,576
Yes.

1479
01:20:40,055 --> 01:20:40,655
Tell me.

1480
01:20:42,277 --> 01:20:44,277
Can you buy me a dress?

1481
01:20:45,025 --> 01:20:45,785
Sure.

1482
01:21:03,473 --> 01:21:05,033
Call up that Kumbakonam fellow!

1483
01:21:05,738 --> 01:21:07,898
His tricks are very
worst off late!

1484
01:21:11,342 --> 01:21:13,640
Stop the car.

1485
01:21:15,429 --> 01:21:16,429
Brave little fellow!

1486
01:21:16,454 --> 01:21:18,707
I'm on my way.

1487
01:21:18,755 --> 01:21:21,555
Now come on. I have
been noticing....

1488
01:21:21,994 --> 01:21:23,914
you keep sending cowards at me.

1489
01:21:24,157 --> 01:21:25,677
I hope, nothing happened to you.

1490
01:21:25,702 --> 01:21:26,543
Oh my god.

1491
01:21:26,568 --> 01:21:28,408
I was worried that
something happened to you.

1492
01:21:28,433 --> 01:21:29,673
Be careful.

1493
01:21:30,220 --> 01:21:33,100
I'm steadily shaping up myself
to take revenge on you.

1494
01:21:33,990 --> 01:21:36,747
I will soon finish
you off and...

1495
01:21:36,772 --> 01:21:38,772
celebrate that in
a grand fashion.

1496
01:21:38,797 --> 01:21:42,157
I will drag your corpse
all over the place.

1497
01:21:42,202 --> 01:21:43,362
Now that sounds like a man!

1498
01:21:43,914 --> 01:21:45,019
Now this...

1499
01:21:45,044 --> 01:21:46,164
Now this is what I expect.

1500
01:21:46,189 --> 01:21:47,389
So come on brother!
[Hasan MRp @ Alpha13 MediaWorks]

1501
01:21:48,496 --> 01:21:50,816
The plot thickens now!

1502
01:21:50,841 --> 01:21:52,161
Indeed.

1503
01:21:52,290 --> 01:21:53,210
Indeed it thickens.

1504
01:21:53,675 --> 01:21:57,635
Your marriage is off because someone
has abducted your bride from Madurai.

1505
01:21:57,660 --> 01:21:59,015
He is now in your town!

1506
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:01,836
Aren't you well versed with every
nook and corner of Coimbatore?

1507
01:22:01,962 --> 01:22:02,602
Now go!

1508
01:22:03,268 --> 01:22:05,611
You fiance is with someone else.

1509
01:22:05,636 --> 01:22:07,716
They are all over the place.

1510
01:22:07,741 --> 01:22:08,821
Catch him if you can.

1511
01:22:10,404 --> 01:22:11,396
What is it?

1512
01:22:11,421 --> 01:22:13,301
Now how's that for a plot?

1513
01:22:34,417 --> 01:22:35,457
Where are you going?

1514
01:22:35,482 --> 01:22:36,282
To make a call.

1515
01:22:48,523 --> 01:22:50,083
Tell me. Has everyone left?

1516
01:22:50,343 --> 01:22:51,423
Yes.

1517
01:22:51,448 --> 01:22:53,578
But David's men
are still around.

1518
01:22:54,139 --> 01:22:54,619
Listen.

1519
01:22:54,976 --> 01:22:55,936
I'm sorry buddy.

1520
01:22:56,056 --> 01:22:57,256
All this is because of me.

1521
01:22:57,460 --> 01:22:59,900
Only if I hadn't been to
the bar last night...

1522
01:23:00,050 --> 01:23:02,490
you would have been here
for Kavitha's marriage.

1523
01:23:02,777 --> 01:23:04,257
So what? Aren't you there?

1524
01:23:05,915 --> 01:23:07,875
Kavitha might be furious.
I'll make it up to her.

1525
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:10,398
Few more hours.

1526
01:23:10,423 --> 01:23:12,023
I'll drop off the
girl and call you.

1527
01:23:12,167 --> 01:23:13,102
Ok?

1528
01:23:13,127 --> 01:23:14,386
Ok buddy.

1529
01:23:14,411 --> 01:23:15,336
Ok.

1530
01:23:19,461 --> 01:23:20,971
Hello brother.

1531
01:23:21,643 --> 01:23:24,123
Do you know if there is any
garments showroom nearby?

1532
01:23:28,678 --> 01:23:30,675
There is a mall over there.

1533
01:23:30,700 --> 01:23:31,540
You'll find it in there.

1534
01:23:31,943 --> 01:23:32,703
Thanks brother.

1535
01:23:32,728 --> 01:23:34,792
That mall belongs to me.

1536
01:23:47,470 --> 01:23:48,710
He is trying to back stab me!

1537
01:23:49,479 --> 01:23:50,479
Make a call to Madurai.

1538
01:23:59,145 --> 01:23:59,905
Tell me dear.

1539
01:23:59,930 --> 01:24:01,130
Uncle...Bharathi?

1540
01:24:01,394 --> 01:24:02,274
Yes I heard it too...

1541
01:24:03,047 --> 01:24:08,047
I had distributed the marriage invitation so
early to bring that fellow out of his hide out.

1542
01:24:08,072 --> 01:24:10,032
Must be some of
my rival's idea.

1543
01:24:10,462 --> 01:24:11,222
I'll take care.

1544
01:24:11,247 --> 01:24:12,327
Uncle, listen to me...

1545
01:24:12,352 --> 01:24:13,672
26th October...

1546
01:24:13,927 --> 01:24:15,527
morning 9 to 10:30...

1547
01:24:15,846 --> 01:24:17,269
the marriage will take
place at EVP hall.

1548
01:24:17,294 --> 01:24:18,014
I'll call you back.

1549
01:24:21,431 --> 01:24:22,591
Where is the groom from?

1550
01:24:22,632 --> 01:24:23,352
Coimbatore.

1551
01:24:24,010 --> 01:24:25,810
That is the place of
the groom I chose.

1552
01:24:25,835 --> 01:24:27,355
What about the one
my daughter chose?

1553
01:24:27,380 --> 01:24:28,060
Kumbakonam.

1554
01:24:37,424 --> 01:24:37,953
Tell me David.

1555
01:24:37,978 --> 01:24:39,547
Where are you?

1556
01:24:39,769 --> 01:24:40,640
At the brookefields mall.

1557
01:24:40,665 --> 01:24:42,345
I'm trying to play
a game here...

1558
01:24:44,929 --> 01:24:48,056
and I find you right at
the finish line already!

1559
01:24:49,154 --> 01:24:51,587
There is a coffee shop
at the second floor.

1560
01:24:51,612 --> 01:24:52,349
Wait there.

1561
01:24:52,374 --> 01:24:53,294
I'm on my way.

1562
01:24:53,319 --> 01:24:55,079
Once I reach, you can
hand her over to me.

1563
01:24:55,104 --> 01:24:55,984
Then you may leave.

1564
01:24:56,333 --> 01:24:57,173
Yeah. Do that.

1565
01:24:57,610 --> 01:24:59,425
I can't take it anymore.

1566
01:24:59,450 --> 01:25:00,410
How's this?

1567
01:25:03,698 --> 01:25:04,498
It's superb!

1568
01:25:06,315 --> 01:25:07,515
Fine. What next?

1569
01:25:09,077 --> 01:25:10,117
How about a coffee?

1570
01:25:18,818 --> 01:25:20,225
2 cappuccinos.

1571
01:25:30,563 --> 01:25:32,604
So finally you did it?

1572
01:25:32,983 --> 01:25:35,596
You finally, took me
out for a coffee.

1573
01:25:35,995 --> 01:25:36,646
Good.

1574
01:25:37,028 --> 01:25:37,988
So go ahead, tell me.

1575
01:25:39,081 --> 01:25:39,521
Well...

1576
01:25:40,604 --> 01:25:41,484
you must tell.

1577
01:25:41,829 --> 01:25:42,549
Should I?

1578
01:25:43,822 --> 01:25:45,142
What's there to know about me?

1579
01:25:45,616 --> 01:25:46,736
I an open book.

1580
01:25:46,922 --> 01:25:49,042
As easy as that.

1581
01:25:49,195 --> 01:25:52,715
But it's you, who is a closed
book and has lots to tell.

1582
01:25:53,006 --> 01:25:53,686
So tell me.

1583
01:25:55,587 --> 01:25:58,147
Otherwise why would you
risk so much for me?

1584
01:25:58,255 --> 01:25:59,290
Tell me.

1585
01:26:01,833 --> 01:26:03,153
Guess she won't let me in peace.

1586
01:26:07,077 --> 01:26:08,397
Am I your first love?

1587
01:26:08,422 --> 01:26:09,862
Have you ever fell
in love before?

1588
01:26:11,420 --> 01:26:12,324
Well, love...

1589
01:26:12,349 --> 01:26:13,269
I know.

1590
01:26:13,294 --> 01:26:14,669
You would have.

1591
01:26:15,039 --> 01:26:15,799
How many of them?

1592
01:26:15,933 --> 01:26:17,972
When did you fell
in love with me?

1593
01:26:18,912 --> 01:26:20,232
Wait. Just a moment.

1594
01:26:21,053 --> 01:26:22,053
I'm not worth that much.

1595
01:26:22,334 --> 01:26:23,134
Ok?

1596
01:26:24,471 --> 01:26:25,111
Forget that.

1597
01:26:25,490 --> 01:26:26,810
Did anyone ever propose you?

1598
01:26:27,366 --> 01:26:28,206
Proposals?

1599
01:26:28,231 --> 01:26:29,071
As usual.

1600
01:26:29,641 --> 01:26:31,201
Who has the guts to woo the
daughter of a big shot.

1601
01:26:31,641 --> 01:26:33,922
Couple of them tried proposing
me during 3rd year of college.

1602
01:26:34,302 --> 01:26:36,742
One guy, he never approached me.

1603
01:26:36,767 --> 01:26:38,847
The other guy didn't
have the guts.

1604
01:26:39,225 --> 01:26:41,025
No one was brave enough
to open their heart.

1605
01:26:41,221 --> 01:26:42,501
What's the use?

1606
01:26:42,526 --> 01:26:44,766
I wonder how such cowards
will ever get someone.

1607
01:26:45,460 --> 01:26:48,740
Actually, I am a show off.

1608
01:26:48,765 --> 01:26:50,245
I'm the best at it.

1609
01:26:51,114 --> 01:26:53,950
You must have noticed since morning.
Haven't you?

1610
01:26:53,975 --> 01:26:54,615
Indeed.

1611
01:26:54,827 --> 01:26:55,627
What a show off.

1612
01:26:56,482 --> 01:26:57,162
Mind blowing.

1613
01:26:57,663 --> 01:26:59,092
Awesome.

1614
01:26:59,117 --> 01:26:59,917
Now you tell me.

1615
01:27:02,054 --> 01:27:03,054
You shouldn't interrupt.

1616
01:27:03,610 --> 01:27:04,090
Ok.

1617
01:27:04,486 --> 01:27:05,347
During my childhood...

1618
01:27:06,164 --> 01:27:07,244
around 6th...

1619
01:27:07,269 --> 01:27:08,269
At an age of 6?

1620
01:27:10,134 --> 01:27:10,974
What did I just say?

1621
01:27:11,201 --> 01:27:11,681
Ok.

1622
01:27:13,666 --> 01:27:14,306
Shall I?

1623
01:27:14,331 --> 01:27:14,851
Yes.

1624
01:27:15,118 --> 01:27:15,638
Ready?

1625
01:27:16,329 --> 01:27:16,889
Ok.

1626
01:27:17,631 --> 01:27:18,671
When I was in the 6th...

1627
01:27:19,123 --> 01:27:19,603
I mean...

1628
01:27:19,628 --> 01:27:20,868
when I was in the 6th grade...

1629
01:27:22,525 --> 01:27:24,045
my whole town fell
in love with a girl.

1630
01:27:26,667 --> 01:27:27,987
I was one among them.

1631
01:27:31,583 --> 01:27:32,223
Mala.

1632
01:27:42,858 --> 01:27:46,058
Hey Shiva, looks like teacher
Paramshivan is quite serious.

1633
01:27:46,228 --> 01:27:48,308
If he dies then we'll have
four days of holidays.

1634
01:27:48,333 --> 01:27:49,733
What about Padma teacher?
When will she die?

1635
01:27:49,758 --> 01:27:53,235
These guys again! They are here
everyday after the school.

1636
01:27:53,260 --> 01:27:55,100
We must change our
route next time!

1637
01:27:59,956 --> 01:28:02,636
We appreciate your unity.

1638
01:28:02,661 --> 01:28:05,358
Buddy, please give me my share
from today's collection.

1639
01:28:05,383 --> 01:28:06,006
Fine.

1640
01:28:06,455 --> 01:28:06,895
Shiva...

1641
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:07,983
Shiva wait.

1642
01:28:08,008 --> 01:28:11,256
- Shiva wait.
- Oh no. Not him again! Troublesome fellow!

1643
01:28:11,281 --> 01:28:11,841
Come on now.

1644
01:28:11,866 --> 01:28:14,026
This greedy fellow won't
even give us money.

1645
01:28:14,231 --> 01:28:17,270
I guess the only way to avoid
him is leaving this place.

1646
01:28:17,295 --> 01:28:18,129
Here.

1647
01:28:18,224 --> 01:28:19,715
Pink color is it?

1648
01:28:20,074 --> 01:28:21,794
No one ever thought of this idea.

1649
01:28:21,917 --> 01:28:23,717
Everyone else are fools.

1650
01:28:23,795 --> 01:28:25,570
All the letters we got
where in a white sheet.

1651
01:28:25,595 --> 01:28:26,275
Except his.

1652
01:28:26,300 --> 01:28:28,340
Every letter he gets is different.

1653
01:28:29,025 --> 01:28:30,465
Love is colorful.

1654
01:28:30,503 --> 01:28:31,943
Hence the different
colored letters.

1655
01:28:31,968 --> 01:28:33,888
Ask her to read my
letter at least today.

1656
01:28:33,913 --> 01:28:36,023
Tell her I'll take
good care of her.

1657
01:28:36,048 --> 01:28:38,128
Leave that, go take care of
your personal hygiene first.

1658
01:28:38,153 --> 01:28:39,033
It stinks!

1659
01:28:39,649 --> 01:28:40,249
Sorry.

1660
01:28:40,274 --> 01:28:42,194
I was grazing the buffaloes.
I came in a rush.

1661
01:28:42,324 --> 01:28:45,724
If she reads your letter,
she'll chase us away!

1662
01:28:45,749 --> 01:28:46,309
Why so?

1663
01:28:46,506 --> 01:28:50,106
Your letter is full of spelling
and grammatical errors!

1664
01:28:50,382 --> 01:28:51,142
Is it?

1665
01:28:52,002 --> 01:28:52,739
I'll improve next time.

1666
01:28:52,772 --> 01:28:54,772
She is totally out
of his league.

1667
01:28:55,562 --> 01:28:56,642
My son is now a doctor.

1668
01:28:56,682 --> 01:28:57,162
Is it?

1669
01:28:57,482 --> 01:28:58,082
Happy to hear.

1670
01:28:58,082 --> 01:28:58,722
Indeed.

1671
01:28:58,747 --> 01:28:59,227
Here.

1672
01:28:59,804 --> 01:29:02,844
Pakkirisami, looks like you
are too generous today.

1673
01:29:02,869 --> 01:29:03,909
Oh come on now.

1674
01:29:04,099 --> 01:29:06,099
There is nothing left
with me anymore.

1675
01:29:06,515 --> 01:29:07,795
What about your family wealth?

1676
01:29:08,070 --> 01:29:09,230
Generations can live off it.

1677
01:29:09,504 --> 01:29:10,328
What do you say Selvam?

1678
01:29:10,353 --> 01:29:11,713
Everyone's house here...

1679
01:29:11,738 --> 01:29:13,498
will someday end up
being mortgaged.

1680
01:29:13,556 --> 01:29:15,396
We mortgaged the house
for his education.

1681
01:29:15,421 --> 01:29:16,843
By the time he finished
his education...

1682
01:29:16,868 --> 01:29:17,748
the house is gone.

1683
01:29:18,063 --> 01:29:19,223
Family's wealth...

1684
01:29:19,386 --> 01:29:21,266
has been completely used
up for his education.

1685
01:29:21,291 --> 01:29:23,414
It is said that "Save the land
by selling what it yields."

1686
01:29:23,439 --> 01:29:24,654
But you took it a step ahead.

1687
01:29:24,679 --> 01:29:27,199
My son has stood first in the state.

1688
01:29:27,598 --> 01:29:29,592
He is the first doctor
in our native.

1689
01:29:29,617 --> 01:29:31,537
It's a pride for me
and my whole family.

1690
01:29:31,562 --> 01:29:34,242
Wait and watch, he will be
the one to save your life.

1691
01:29:34,267 --> 01:29:35,027
See you.

1692
01:29:35,052 --> 01:29:36,212
Greetings Doctor.

1693
01:29:36,237 --> 01:29:36,997
See you uncle.

1694
01:29:40,433 --> 01:29:41,823
- My son has become a doctor.
- Congrats.

1695
01:29:41,848 --> 01:29:44,448
Ask your son to build a very
big hospital in our town.

1696
01:29:45,097 --> 01:29:45,817
You bet!

1697
01:29:45,842 --> 01:29:48,522
- What's the occasion?
- What about us?

1698
01:29:48,547 --> 01:29:50,387
Selvam is now a doctor.
So here take it.

1699
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:51,149
Have it.

1700
01:29:51,174 --> 01:29:53,094
Wow! Selvam has become a doctor!

1701
01:29:53,816 --> 01:29:56,774
Please don't inject us with
needles when we fall sick.

1702
01:29:56,799 --> 01:29:58,359
Cure us with pills.

1703
01:29:58,503 --> 01:29:59,383
Ok. Sure.

1704
01:29:59,631 --> 01:30:00,511
Where are you going?

1705
01:30:00,536 --> 01:30:01,816
Isn't your house that way?

1706
01:30:01,914 --> 01:30:03,074
We are on our way
for our tuition.

1707
01:30:03,099 --> 01:30:04,021
You mean to Mala's house?

1708
01:30:04,046 --> 01:30:04,566
Yes.

1709
01:30:07,742 --> 01:30:08,702
Here. Have some more.

1710
01:30:09,441 --> 01:30:10,561
Why are you bribing us?

1711
01:30:11,910 --> 01:30:12,470
Take it first.

1712
01:30:15,221 --> 01:30:16,861
Hand this over to Mala.

1713
01:30:17,176 --> 01:30:18,696
Not you!

1714
01:30:18,981 --> 01:30:21,046
We thought you are the only
disciplined man in our town.

1715
01:30:21,146 --> 01:30:22,226
- Well, now that has turned into a myth.
- Quite!

1716
01:30:22,329 --> 01:30:23,449
Pakkirisami...

1717
01:30:23,774 --> 01:30:24,294
look here.

1718
01:30:24,319 --> 01:30:25,759
- You fatso!
- See what your son is up to.

1719
01:30:25,784 --> 01:30:27,772
- Move!
- I hope he doesn't turn into love doctor.

1720
01:30:27,797 --> 01:30:30,357
- Alert everyone!
- I said move!

1721
01:30:30,382 --> 01:30:32,582
Pakkirisami, all your
dreams have gone in vain.

1722
01:30:32,696 --> 01:30:33,309
Shiva...

1723
01:30:33,335 --> 01:30:35,615
check what the doctor has
prescribed in his letter.

1724
01:30:41,158 --> 01:30:42,678
Looks like a poem.

1725
01:30:42,703 --> 01:30:44,103
- But I can't understand it.
- Get me some water.

1726
01:30:44,128 --> 01:30:46,688
Well, who understands
a doctor's writing?

1727
01:30:46,713 --> 01:30:47,273
Show it to me.

1728
01:30:47,870 --> 01:30:48,990
Excuse me...

1729
01:30:49,074 --> 01:30:51,914
this is waste paper.
Please use this.

1730
01:30:55,518 --> 01:30:58,158
It's not important that we
earn from these Romeos.

1731
01:30:58,183 --> 01:30:58,863
Got it?

1732
01:30:59,051 --> 01:30:59,851
But...

1733
01:30:59,940 --> 01:31:01,260
for a mere ten bucks...

1734
01:31:01,482 --> 01:31:03,602
Shiva sacrificed his love.

1735
01:31:03,627 --> 01:31:04,867
That is what everyone will say.

1736
01:31:05,154 --> 01:31:05,975
Forget them.

1737
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,680
It's the achievement
that is important.

1738
01:31:08,034 --> 01:31:10,674
No matter what happens. Today you
must confess your love to her.

1739
01:31:10,900 --> 01:31:15,300
I'll handle anybody and
everybody who interferes.

1740
01:31:15,325 --> 01:31:17,605
Immature people! You be brave.

1741
01:31:18,075 --> 01:31:20,555
I'll go home and get few things.

1742
01:31:20,580 --> 01:31:22,940
You must propose her today.
We'll meet at the tuition class.

1743
01:31:22,965 --> 01:31:23,605
Ok buddy?

1744
01:31:24,303 --> 01:31:25,343
I swear...

1745
01:31:25,368 --> 01:31:27,019
I'll look into her
eyes and propose her.

1746
01:31:27,044 --> 01:31:28,244
Well, that's your choice.

1747
01:31:28,269 --> 01:31:28,749
Come on.

1748
01:31:44,730 --> 01:31:50,330
Oh my dear! What a beauty.

1749
01:31:50,355 --> 01:31:56,115
It showers rain in my
heart, every time I see her.

1750
01:32:04,751 --> 01:32:07,311
Buddy, it's working. Look there.

1751
01:32:07,466 --> 01:32:08,826
Our tutor, Mala is
looking at you.

1752
01:32:09,848 --> 01:32:10,808
This is the right time.

1753
01:32:11,294 --> 01:32:12,494
Go tell her.

1754
01:32:12,745 --> 01:32:13,945
I'll take care of the rest.

1755
01:32:14,651 --> 01:32:15,251
Go. Go. Go.

1756
01:32:19,959 --> 01:32:20,817
Mala...

1757
01:32:21,275 --> 01:32:22,635
I want to say something.

1758
01:32:23,370 --> 01:32:25,050
What is it? What do
you want to say?

1759
01:32:25,075 --> 01:32:26,555
Mala, I love you.

1760
01:32:29,858 --> 01:32:30,778
What are you looking at?

1761
01:32:30,803 --> 01:32:31,443
Nothing.

1762
01:32:35,940 --> 01:32:38,068
Why are you laughing?

1763
01:32:38,877 --> 01:32:39,317
Dear...

1764
01:32:39,342 --> 01:32:40,382
say that once again.

1765
01:32:40,681 --> 01:32:41,321
Mala...

1766
01:32:41,895 --> 01:32:42,815
I love you.

1767
01:32:44,648 --> 01:32:46,528
Hey! One more please.

1768
01:32:46,553 --> 01:32:48,073
I said don't laugh.

1769
01:32:48,822 --> 01:32:50,982
Did anyone of you get this idea?

1770
01:32:53,204 --> 01:32:54,844
What is my little
brother saying?

1771
01:32:55,286 --> 01:32:56,526
When he said it...

1772
01:32:56,776 --> 01:32:57,576
he meant...

1773
01:32:57,857 --> 01:32:59,137
that he loves me as his sister.

1774
01:32:59,374 --> 01:33:00,174
My little brother...

1775
01:33:00,199 --> 01:33:02,799
loves me, his sister very much.

1776
01:33:03,196 --> 01:33:04,036
Isn't it dear?

1777
01:33:04,872 --> 01:33:05,672
Now come here.

1778
01:33:06,099 --> 01:33:08,052
Come on. Come here.

1779
01:33:08,077 --> 01:33:10,077
My little brother, come here.

1780
01:33:10,551 --> 01:33:11,791
Come to me.

1781
01:33:11,816 --> 01:33:12,496
No , I won't.

1782
01:33:12,521 --> 01:33:13,641
I'll cane you! Sit down.

1783
01:33:21,065 --> 01:33:21,999
So tell me...

1784
01:33:22,024 --> 01:33:24,975
why don't you punish me
like you punish others?

1785
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,080
Why don't you scold
me like you scold others?

1786
01:33:27,346 --> 01:33:30,866
You keep smiling at me always
and never give me home work too.

1787
01:33:31,106 --> 01:33:34,744
When all those useless men
in the town loves you...

1788
01:33:34,769 --> 01:33:35,809
why shouldn't I love you?

1789
01:33:37,262 --> 01:33:40,542
That's because you are the
only one I love in this town.

1790
01:33:41,403 --> 01:33:43,323
I love my brother very much.

1791
01:33:45,150 --> 01:33:50,950
It showers rain in my
heart, every time I see her.

1792
01:33:51,086 --> 01:33:56,526
Every time I think
about you, my dear...

1793
01:33:56,765 --> 01:34:02,002
My heart jumps with joy....

1794
01:34:02,027 --> 01:34:04,861
Oh my shining star...

1795
01:34:04,886 --> 01:34:08,246
Yes, that is what you are.

1796
01:34:08,271 --> 01:34:13,911
Oh my dear! What a beauty.

1797
01:34:13,936 --> 01:34:20,016
It showers rain in my
heart, every time I see her.

1798
01:34:43,168 --> 01:34:49,154
When you talk, it rains
flowers all around me.

1799
01:34:49,179 --> 01:34:54,365
When I am with you, even the
scorching sun feels like the winter.

1800
01:34:54,390 --> 01:35:00,115
Even the moon looks
dull in front of you.

1801
01:35:00,140 --> 01:35:05,860
Even the rainbow wishes
that it was you.

1802
01:35:05,885 --> 01:35:08,741
Oh my dear!

1803
01:35:08,766 --> 01:35:11,206
Oh my dear!

1804
01:35:11,231 --> 01:35:14,471
Take me along with you.

1805
01:35:14,496 --> 01:35:17,390
My heart yearns for you.

1806
01:35:17,415 --> 01:35:23,085
Oh my dear! What a beauty.

1807
01:35:23,110 --> 01:35:29,241
It showers rain in my
heart, every time I see her.

1808
01:35:30,424 --> 01:35:34,344
Excuse me, please let my dad know
that I am my cousin's place.

1809
01:35:43,930 --> 01:35:49,810
I only see you and nothing else.

1810
01:35:49,835 --> 01:35:54,849
Every step of yours towards
me brings happiness.

1811
01:35:54,874 --> 01:36:00,552
I now see a whole new meaning
to all those great poems.

1812
01:36:00,577 --> 01:36:06,337
Oh my dear, you are
an angel in disguise.

1813
01:36:06,362 --> 01:36:09,191
Oh my dear.

1814
01:36:09,216 --> 01:36:11,773
Oh my dear.

1815
01:36:11,798 --> 01:36:14,786
So what do you say?

1816
01:36:15,031 --> 01:36:17,953
My shyness conveys
my love for you.

1817
01:36:17,957 --> 01:36:23,477
Oh my dear! What a beauty.

1818
01:36:23,502 --> 01:36:29,462
It showers rain in my
heart, every time I see her.

1819
01:36:42,335 --> 01:36:44,335
There was a time
when you obeyed me.

1820
01:36:44,360 --> 01:36:47,280
But looks like you have grown up
enough to question me now. Isn't it?

1821
01:36:49,335 --> 01:36:50,915
How many more transfers?

1822
01:36:50,940 --> 01:36:52,780
This place was your fifth transfer.

1823
01:36:53,537 --> 01:36:56,877
Without knowing anything, I
just blindly followed you.

1824
01:36:56,917 --> 01:36:57,877
But now I know.

1825
01:36:58,340 --> 01:37:00,260
Looks like some issue.
Let's leave.

1826
01:37:00,393 --> 01:37:01,993
Hey! Get lost!

1827
01:37:02,388 --> 01:37:02,868
Get lost!

1828
01:37:02,893 --> 01:37:04,493
Come on. Let's leave.

1829
01:37:05,797 --> 01:37:06,437
Come on.

1830
01:37:06,462 --> 01:37:10,862
You open a chit fund system in all the
places you go and finally cheat everyone.

1831
01:37:11,663 --> 01:37:13,583
It's been 8 years
since we are here.

1832
01:37:14,304 --> 01:37:15,424
So I guess you are done.

1833
01:37:15,449 --> 01:37:19,449
Your drinking has destroyed all our wealth and
over that you had borrowed too many loans.

1834
01:37:21,063 --> 01:37:23,423
And now you are
going to give in.

1835
01:37:23,648 --> 01:37:24,208
Isn't it?

1836
01:37:27,948 --> 01:37:29,668
It was all for your marriage.

1837
01:37:30,071 --> 01:37:31,951
I don't need such a wedding dad.

1838
01:37:32,729 --> 01:37:34,209
I have no one but you.

1839
01:37:34,234 --> 01:37:35,954
You too have none but me.

1840
01:37:37,586 --> 01:37:39,226
Let's stay back here.

1841
01:37:40,538 --> 01:37:44,858
Look, I can't go
away from Shiva.

1842
01:37:46,014 --> 01:37:47,454
Is it Shiva or...

1843
01:37:48,015 --> 01:37:49,615
is it Selvam?

1844
01:37:52,039 --> 01:37:52,879
I know.

1845
01:37:53,976 --> 01:37:54,576
Look here.

1846
01:37:55,448 --> 01:37:56,768
There are only two ways out.

1847
01:37:57,097 --> 01:37:58,697
It's been four days since the auction.

1848
01:37:59,117 --> 01:38:01,237
I must pay car owner
the money by tomorrow.

1849
01:38:01,799 --> 01:38:03,039
Or else he'll finish me off.

1850
01:38:03,362 --> 01:38:04,522
Either let that happen...

1851
01:38:04,547 --> 01:38:06,107
or else let me commit suicide.

1852
01:38:17,506 --> 01:38:18,026
Listen...

1853
01:38:18,862 --> 01:38:20,062
Tell me why are you crying?

1854
01:38:20,453 --> 01:38:20,893
Shiva

1855
01:38:24,777 --> 01:38:25,384
Shiva...

1856
01:38:25,728 --> 01:38:27,168
pass this letter to Selvam.

1857
01:38:31,045 --> 01:38:32,645
So aren't you in love with me?

1858
01:38:33,872 --> 01:38:35,272
I don't know how to explain.

1859
01:38:37,251 --> 01:38:38,171
You are my brother.

1860
01:38:39,103 --> 01:38:40,383
I love you very much.

1861
01:38:46,415 --> 01:38:46,935
Fine.

1862
01:38:47,302 --> 01:38:47,862
Don't cry.

1863
01:38:47,887 --> 01:38:51,079
So you want this letter to be
delivered to Selvam? Don't worry.

1864
01:38:51,104 --> 01:38:51,744
I'll take care.

1865
01:38:56,941 --> 01:38:57,765
Looks like his marriage is over.
Lucky fellow!

1866
01:38:57,789 --> 01:38:59,335
There is Shiva. Let's
take him along with us.

1867
01:38:59,360 --> 01:39:00,280
Where are you going?

1868
01:39:00,305 --> 01:39:00,991
To Selvam's house.

1869
01:39:01,016 --> 01:39:05,525
Seems like they are playing the movie
'Captain Prabhakaran' at Palani's house.

1870
01:39:05,550 --> 01:39:08,110
- Come let's go join them and watch it.
- Yes. Come on.

1871
01:39:10,330 --> 01:39:12,170
Did you listen to
me when I told you?

1872
01:39:12,195 --> 01:39:13,795
Nothing is left.

1873
01:39:13,820 --> 01:39:15,620
Both, he and his
daughter have absconded.

1874
01:39:15,645 --> 01:39:16,925
You guys don't pay
heed to my words!

1875
01:39:16,950 --> 01:39:19,274
They have left nothing behind.
Destroy their house.

1876
01:39:19,299 --> 01:39:21,945
He played Judas with
the whole town!

1877
01:39:21,970 --> 01:39:23,890
- Where is Selvam?
- I don't know.

1878
01:39:24,424 --> 01:39:26,104
Looks like some
issue over there.

1879
01:39:26,306 --> 01:39:27,866
It's happening at Mala's house.

1880
01:39:27,891 --> 01:39:28,872
Come on, let's go check it out.

1881
01:39:30,263 --> 01:39:31,703
They seemed to be
really furious.

1882
01:39:34,188 --> 01:39:35,708
Look. There is Selvam.

1883
01:39:46,972 --> 01:39:49,092
Why are you all
thrashing my son?

1884
01:39:50,376 --> 01:39:51,416
Leave him.

1885
01:39:52,268 --> 01:39:53,988
Stop it. Please stop it.

1886
01:39:55,033 --> 01:39:55,790
He is a doctor.

1887
01:39:55,815 --> 01:39:56,655
Please stop it.

1888
01:39:56,680 --> 01:39:57,589
I said stop it.

1889
01:39:57,614 --> 01:39:59,174
Please, have some respect.
He is a doctor.

1890
01:39:59,313 --> 01:40:01,345
Listen, even I'm shocked.

1891
01:40:01,715 --> 01:40:02,675
I said leave me.

1892
01:40:02,700 --> 01:40:04,540
- Oh my god.
- Try to understand.

1893
01:40:07,831 --> 01:40:10,217
Stop blaming me unnecessarily.

1894
01:40:10,242 --> 01:40:11,042
I said stop.

1895
01:40:11,108 --> 01:40:12,228
Why are you thrashing him?

1896
01:40:12,842 --> 01:40:14,202
I said I don't know.

1897
01:40:14,402 --> 01:40:15,962
Leave me!

1898
01:40:16,042 --> 01:40:17,842
Can't you hear me? I said I don't know!

1899
01:40:21,996 --> 01:40:25,256
Stop it. Move! Stop
thrashing him you cowards!

1900
01:40:25,281 --> 01:40:26,521
- All our money is gone.
- Fool!

1901
01:40:26,546 --> 01:40:28,684
What brutality is this?

1902
01:40:29,161 --> 01:40:31,614
You guys need your money back.
Isn't it. I shall repay you.

1903
01:40:31,639 --> 01:40:32,319
Get up.

1904
01:40:32,840 --> 01:40:34,120
Somebody give a hand.

1905
01:40:35,724 --> 01:40:37,484
Aren't you supposed
to be at school?

1906
01:40:37,509 --> 01:40:38,549
Now leave. Go to school.

1907
01:40:38,987 --> 01:40:40,387
Come on. Let's leave.

1908
01:40:54,498 --> 01:40:56,338
Where is Selvam?

1909
01:40:56,839 --> 01:40:58,679
Our doctor has turned retard.

1910
01:40:58,937 --> 01:41:01,999
He doesn't realise that his dad passed
away. He is sitting by the fields.

1911
01:41:19,196 --> 01:41:20,436
Where might have she gone?

1912
01:41:20,461 --> 01:41:21,781
It's so strange that she left.

1913
01:41:27,774 --> 01:41:29,214
Shiva! Come here.

1914
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:30,652
Where is Mala?

1915
01:41:30,677 --> 01:41:31,237
No...

1916
01:41:31,262 --> 01:41:32,422
Did she tell you something?

1917
01:41:33,836 --> 01:41:34,516
Nothing?

1918
01:41:35,845 --> 01:41:37,433
Where did she go?

1919
01:41:37,567 --> 01:41:39,327
She should have informed me.
Isn't it?

1920
01:41:39,680 --> 01:41:41,539
Are you sure that she
didn't leave any message?

1921
01:41:41,564 --> 01:41:43,070
Where could have
she possibly gone?

1922
01:41:43,095 --> 01:41:45,775
If she had to elope, she should
have eloped with me. Right?

1923
01:41:47,631 --> 01:41:48,391
Now, where is she?

1924
01:41:49,213 --> 01:41:50,773
Everyone are thrashing me.

1925
01:41:51,205 --> 01:41:52,125
Where is she?

1926
01:41:53,095 --> 01:41:54,624
She didn't even leave a message.

1927
01:41:54,649 --> 01:41:56,529
Where is Mala? Did she
leave any message?

1928
01:41:56,720 --> 01:41:57,591
Do you have any idea?

1929
01:41:57,616 --> 01:41:58,296
Tell me.

1930
01:41:58,321 --> 01:41:59,841
Shiva, tell me.

1931
01:41:59,873 --> 01:42:02,713
Shiva, tell me. Shiva.

1932
01:42:39,961 --> 01:42:40,761
Damn it!

1933
01:42:41,570 --> 01:42:44,090
Is it why you help
many couples unite?

1934
01:42:44,411 --> 01:42:44,971
Well no...

1935
01:42:46,409 --> 01:42:46,889
Now...

1936
01:42:47,708 --> 01:42:50,077
Now, we are having
a conversation.

1937
01:42:50,645 --> 01:42:53,005
Say, suddenly a boy comes
by and says he is hungry...

1938
01:42:53,336 --> 01:42:55,096
we refuse and ask
him to move on.

1939
01:42:55,622 --> 01:42:57,982
Now he leaves, after sometime
he faints and passes away.

1940
01:42:58,188 --> 01:42:59,006
How guilty would that make us?

1941
01:42:59,031 --> 01:43:00,391
Won't we regret?

1942
01:43:00,437 --> 01:43:02,665
He would've been alive if we had helped.
Won't the guilt kill us?

1943
01:43:02,843 --> 01:43:04,083
Such a guilty feeling.

1944
01:43:06,096 --> 01:43:07,841
This is something similar.

1945
01:43:07,866 --> 01:43:10,161
Say, again we see
a boy starving...

1946
01:43:10,186 --> 01:43:10,841
what would we do?

1947
01:43:10,866 --> 01:43:12,626
We would give him
money for food.

1948
01:43:12,651 --> 01:43:14,825
In fact, we would give enough
money to have food for days.

1949
01:43:14,850 --> 01:43:16,290
Won't we try rectifying
our mistake?

1950
01:43:16,321 --> 01:43:17,499
The happiness we get from it...

1951
01:43:17,524 --> 01:43:18,684
The excitement it brings.

1952
01:43:20,383 --> 01:43:20,863
Well...

1953
01:43:21,407 --> 01:43:22,567
this is something similar.

1954
01:43:23,328 --> 01:43:23,768
Hence...

1955
01:43:24,335 --> 01:43:25,904
whenever a friend or
friends of friends...

1956
01:43:25,929 --> 01:43:28,449
come to me with a
problem in love...

1957
01:43:28,536 --> 01:43:29,896
No matter whoever it is...

1958
01:43:31,232 --> 01:43:31,952
I help them.

1959
01:43:35,477 --> 01:43:37,037
What I did to Mala and Selvam...

1960
01:43:37,062 --> 01:43:38,022
Fine, I get that...

1961
01:43:38,309 --> 01:43:40,229
I would love to see
that childhood Shiva.

1962
01:43:43,171 --> 01:43:46,144
Look. Over there.
Looks like Mala.

1963
01:43:47,622 --> 01:43:48,262
Look.

1964
01:43:57,122 --> 01:43:58,882
No Bharathi. That is not Mala.

1965
01:43:59,772 --> 01:44:00,972
That is someone else.

1966
01:44:21,066 --> 01:44:22,186
How do you know Mala?

1967
01:44:22,450 --> 01:44:23,330
Isn't it?

1968
01:44:23,443 --> 01:44:24,363
How do I know her?

1969
01:44:25,412 --> 01:44:27,212
But the moment I
took her name...

1970
01:44:27,495 --> 01:44:29,495
did you see how
spontaneous you were?

1971
01:44:30,476 --> 01:44:32,156
I saw that good old
childhood Shiva.

1972
01:44:34,419 --> 01:44:36,819
I know that you still
love her very much.

1973
01:44:37,585 --> 01:44:38,305
Dear Bharathi...

1974
01:44:39,421 --> 01:44:40,381
I meant, Bharathi...

1975
01:44:41,111 --> 01:44:42,391
She is like a sister.

1976
01:44:44,362 --> 01:44:44,842
Now...

1977
01:44:45,322 --> 01:44:46,562
this term 'I love you'...

1978
01:44:46,805 --> 01:44:51,805
can be used for mom, dad,
siblings and objects.

1979
01:44:52,001 --> 01:44:53,582
But down here...

1980
01:44:53,607 --> 01:44:55,887
we have stereotyped it, using
it only to propose a girl.

1981
01:44:58,318 --> 01:44:59,278
My love is...

1982
01:45:00,643 --> 01:45:01,563
nothing but...

1983
01:45:02,267 --> 01:45:04,507
the care that I had on
Mala during my childhood.

1984
01:45:05,886 --> 01:45:07,126
She believed too much in me.

1985
01:45:07,571 --> 01:45:08,451
And I betrayed her.

1986
01:45:08,476 --> 01:45:10,276
I hope you won't
do the same to me?

1987
01:45:30,374 --> 01:45:34,678
Every time I go against him,
I keep losing something.

1988
01:45:34,703 --> 01:45:37,263
But this time I will return only
after Cheilyan's death.

1989
01:45:39,185 --> 01:45:41,682
Just in case, if they
finish me off...

1990
01:45:41,718 --> 01:45:44,038
don't think too much.
Go back to your homes.

1991
01:45:45,327 --> 01:45:46,327
Understood?

1992
01:45:48,784 --> 01:45:52,024
You can judge me all you want
for eloping with you.

1993
01:45:52,846 --> 01:45:54,446
But don't think I'm retard.

1994
01:45:55,662 --> 01:45:56,996
I didn't come out
just like that.

1995
01:45:57,021 --> 01:45:58,781
It's the trust that
I have upon you.

1996
01:45:59,258 --> 01:46:02,218
Every girl has a
guy in her mind.

1997
01:46:02,752 --> 01:46:04,432
She yearns for him.

1998
01:46:05,801 --> 01:46:06,921
Just like you guys say...

1999
01:46:07,036 --> 01:46:09,556
love at first sight or love
after missing each other.

2000
01:46:09,581 --> 01:46:11,461
In this case, it's
love by imagination.

2001
01:46:12,048 --> 01:46:12,728
Well...
[Hasan MRp @ Alpha13 MediaWorks]

2002
01:46:13,546 --> 01:46:15,826
a girl must find out the guy
she had in her imagination.

2003
01:46:16,070 --> 01:46:17,070
As simple as that.

2004
01:46:17,926 --> 01:46:19,246
That is how I found you.

2005
01:46:19,705 --> 01:46:22,305
You came into my life
at the right time.

2006
01:46:22,330 --> 01:46:25,014
The 80th anniversary of that old
couple, that you organized;

2007
01:46:25,039 --> 01:46:29,959
what else will impress a girl more
that that and to get to know you?

2008
01:46:30,581 --> 01:46:31,842
What are you talking about?

2009
01:46:31,867 --> 01:46:34,707
Everyone in my circle knows about
this 80th anniversary couple's story.

2010
01:46:35,104 --> 01:46:36,744
I can narrate it
over and over again.

2011
01:46:36,769 --> 01:46:38,329
You must know it.
Shall I narrate?

2012
01:46:40,380 --> 01:46:41,020
Yes.

2013
01:46:41,716 --> 01:46:43,956
Since, I couldn't attend
my friends marriage...

2014
01:46:44,020 --> 01:46:48,140
I made a visit to her place in Kumbakonam.

2015
01:46:48,649 --> 01:46:49,821
That's when...

2016
01:46:49,846 --> 01:46:51,366
I saw you for the first time.

2017
01:47:44,090 --> 01:47:48,370
Parents have immense trust on their kids
but there is always a little doubt.

2018
01:47:48,395 --> 01:47:50,435
A doubt that their child
might get into trouble.

2019
01:47:50,460 --> 01:47:52,500
But your parent's don't
have that doubt.

2020
01:47:52,574 --> 01:47:54,134
You friends celebrate you.

2021
01:47:54,691 --> 01:47:56,891
What else do I have
to know about you?

2022
01:47:57,330 --> 01:47:58,170
I've no doubts.

2023
01:47:58,386 --> 01:47:59,906
That's why I came
along with you.

2024
01:48:00,301 --> 01:48:02,021
Didn't you already inform your friends?

2025
01:48:02,331 --> 01:48:03,371
Hope everything is set?

2026
01:48:03,862 --> 01:48:06,902
I always believed that something
special is about to happen.

2027
01:48:06,927 --> 01:48:08,247
And now it has happened.

2028
01:48:08,272 --> 01:48:09,032
I met you.

2029
01:48:10,601 --> 01:48:12,601
You keep coming back to me again and again.

2030
01:48:12,832 --> 01:48:13,934
The first time you
abducted me...

2031
01:48:13,959 --> 01:48:14,999
you left me stranded.

2032
01:48:15,476 --> 01:48:18,036
Second time, you left me
stranded in the stage.

2033
01:48:18,837 --> 01:48:20,997
This is the third time
and I am here with you.

2034
01:48:21,258 --> 01:48:23,138
This time, I won't leave you.

2035
01:48:23,163 --> 01:48:23,963
But...

2036
01:48:24,809 --> 01:48:26,329
you haven't said it yet.

2037
01:48:27,040 --> 01:48:27,680
I mean...

2038
01:48:31,274 --> 01:48:32,394
the words 'I Love you.'

2039
01:48:32,972 --> 01:48:34,732
I'm waiting to say
it after you do.

2040
01:48:42,021 --> 01:48:43,021
Your phone is ringing.

2041
01:48:46,639 --> 01:48:47,199
Shiva..

2042
01:48:47,224 --> 01:48:47,864
Just a moment.

2043
01:48:49,019 --> 01:48:50,104
I'll be back.

2044
01:48:53,434 --> 01:48:54,314
Tell me David.

2045
01:48:54,700 --> 01:48:55,980
You sound too brave.

2046
01:48:56,005 --> 01:48:56,845
Turn around.

2047
01:48:59,360 --> 01:49:01,520
Instead of chopping your hands off...

2048
01:49:01,928 --> 01:49:04,168
I'm letting you get away for
obeying my order.

2049
01:49:04,735 --> 01:49:05,335
Now leave.

2050
01:49:05,631 --> 01:49:07,231
You may now go back
to your family.

2051
01:49:09,824 --> 01:49:11,143
David, this girl
trusts me a lot.

2052
01:49:11,168 --> 01:49:12,448
So please David....

2053
01:49:13,041 --> 01:49:14,681
I won't repeat it again.

2054
01:49:14,706 --> 01:49:15,786
Now shut up and leave.

2055
01:49:15,956 --> 01:49:17,956
I'll order my men to
finish of your dad.

2056
01:49:17,981 --> 01:49:18,501
Now go!

2057
01:49:18,719 --> 01:49:20,439
David, please listen to me.

2058
01:49:31,776 --> 01:49:32,576
Tell me Keera.

2059
01:49:32,601 --> 01:49:34,921
Buddy, is something
serious over there?

2060
01:49:39,754 --> 01:49:41,384
Here is the balance for
the catering services..

2061
01:49:41,409 --> 01:49:43,489
David's men have
round up behind Dad.

2062
01:49:44,394 --> 01:49:45,314
I'm worried.

2063
01:49:46,915 --> 01:49:47,435
Move!

2064
01:49:47,927 --> 01:49:48,607
You there?

2065
01:49:50,021 --> 01:49:50,541
Buddy?

2066
01:49:51,011 --> 01:49:52,371
Tell me, what is the problem?

2067
01:49:53,401 --> 01:49:54,001
Buddy.

2068
01:50:01,408 --> 01:50:02,248
What happened?

2069
01:50:02,639 --> 01:50:03,519
Well...

2070
01:50:04,392 --> 01:50:05,072
Sit down.

2071
01:50:06,348 --> 01:50:08,388
Give me ten mins. I'll
just go to the restroom.

2072
01:50:08,413 --> 01:50:10,729
Why so much time?

2073
01:50:11,793 --> 01:50:12,553
Fine. Go.

2074
01:50:15,706 --> 01:50:16,226
Shiva.

2075
01:50:19,983 --> 01:50:20,788
Nothing. Go.

2076
01:51:43,204 --> 01:51:44,764
Are you all Shiva's friends?

2077
01:51:45,788 --> 01:51:47,537
Have a seat.

2078
01:51:51,163 --> 01:51:51,643
Keera.

2079
01:51:52,027 --> 01:51:52,787
Tell me.

2080
01:51:53,565 --> 01:51:55,205
I committed a
mistake once again.

2081
01:51:55,325 --> 01:51:56,948
What happened?

2082
01:51:56,973 --> 01:51:58,533
Why do you sound nervous?

2083
01:51:58,986 --> 01:52:00,226
For my own good...

2084
01:52:00,696 --> 01:52:02,656
I just betrayed a girl
who trusts me blindly.

2085
01:52:03,164 --> 01:52:04,084
What are you saying?

2086
01:52:06,675 --> 01:52:08,557
Is it destiny that
brought me to David?

2087
01:52:08,582 --> 01:52:12,102
Is it destiny that I had to go to Madurai
and abduct her and reach Coimbatore?

2088
01:52:14,369 --> 01:52:15,730
Why is she so crazy about me?

2089
01:52:15,755 --> 01:52:16,875
What? She loves you!

2090
01:52:17,941 --> 01:52:19,501
Why is all this happening to me?

2091
01:52:20,672 --> 01:52:22,672
Tell me Keera..Why is all
this happening to me?

2092
01:52:22,798 --> 01:52:24,398
Tell me!

2093
01:52:24,677 --> 01:52:25,917
What did I do to deserve this?

2094
01:52:25,942 --> 01:52:27,662
Tell me, why do I deserve this?

2095
01:52:53,573 --> 01:52:54,653
Stop!

2096
01:52:58,231 --> 01:52:58,911
Catch her!

2097
01:53:03,002 --> 01:53:03,842
Don't let her go!

2098
01:53:14,178 --> 01:53:15,218
Stop!

2099
01:53:16,675 --> 01:53:17,155
Catch her!

2100
01:53:17,405 --> 01:53:18,685
She is getting into the lift.

2101
01:53:18,853 --> 01:53:19,533
Catch her.

2102
01:53:28,825 --> 01:53:30,345
Open the lift!

2103
01:53:32,402 --> 01:53:34,225
It's going down.

2104
01:53:34,250 --> 01:53:35,570
Come on, let's go.

2105
01:53:37,818 --> 01:53:40,058
Sir, I'm in trouble.

2106
01:53:40,083 --> 01:53:43,763
Please help me reach the
nearest police station.

2107
01:53:43,788 --> 01:53:44,548
Please sir.

2108
01:53:46,794 --> 01:53:47,474
Please help me.

2109
01:53:47,644 --> 01:53:51,484
Please, I'm deep in trouble.
Please help me.

2110
01:53:54,217 --> 01:53:56,097
Please help me brother.

2111
01:54:17,047 --> 01:54:17,567
Shiva?

2112
01:54:28,234 --> 01:54:28,874
Shiva?

2113
01:54:31,829 --> 01:54:32,995
Shiva!

2114
01:54:48,787 --> 01:54:50,587
Where are you escaping?

2115
01:54:50,989 --> 01:54:52,029
Come now!

2116
01:55:52,204 --> 01:55:52,804
Come on.

2117
01:56:27,991 --> 01:56:29,482
Where are you going?

2118
01:56:34,156 --> 01:56:35,156
Come on. Let's go.

2119
01:56:35,411 --> 01:56:37,261
Who are you?

2120
01:56:38,240 --> 01:56:39,160
Leave my hands.

2121
01:56:39,823 --> 01:56:41,023
My boy friend is around.

2122
01:56:41,524 --> 01:56:44,124
If he sees this,
you'll be done for.

2123
01:56:45,304 --> 01:56:47,784
To abduct you from Madurai
and leave you here...

2124
01:56:48,148 --> 01:56:48,988
that was his task.

2125
01:56:49,071 --> 01:56:50,191
He has left now.

2126
01:56:50,699 --> 01:56:51,619
Come with me.

2127
01:56:52,117 --> 01:56:52,917
Let us wait.

2128
01:56:53,265 --> 01:56:54,389
He'll come.

2129
01:56:54,414 --> 01:56:55,534
He won't come.

2130
01:56:56,338 --> 01:56:57,098
What's the time?

2131
01:56:58,660 --> 01:56:59,300
3:10.

2132
01:56:59,479 --> 01:57:00,479
Tell me the exact time.

2133
01:57:00,504 --> 01:57:01,435
He won't come.

2134
01:57:04,972 --> 01:57:06,289
I said move.

2135
01:57:11,265 --> 01:57:12,345
Look at that.

2136
01:57:12,370 --> 01:57:13,679
Who is he?

2137
01:57:39,724 --> 01:57:41,204
Where were you all these years?

2138
01:57:42,104 --> 01:57:43,264
I looked for you everywhere.

2139
01:57:45,643 --> 01:57:46,723
What bought you here?

2140
01:57:49,382 --> 01:57:51,742
I'll don't think twice to help,
even if it's for a stranger.

2141
01:57:53,373 --> 01:57:54,420
What bought you to the mall?

2142
01:57:56,428 --> 01:57:58,068
What's is the issue
you are facing?

2143
01:57:58,168 --> 01:57:58,648
Selvam?

2144
01:58:00,199 --> 01:58:01,159
How is Selvam?

2145
01:58:02,841 --> 01:58:05,081
I've lost myself worrying
about you all these years.

2146
01:58:06,142 --> 01:58:08,422
Even now I was talking
about you to Bharathi.

2147
01:58:08,729 --> 01:58:09,929
As I keep talking about you...

2148
01:58:10,468 --> 01:58:12,428
she get more curious about you.

2149
01:58:15,809 --> 01:58:16,809
Who is Bharathi?

2150
01:58:20,337 --> 01:58:21,937
Stop repeating yourself.

2151
01:58:22,497 --> 01:58:23,257
He won't come.

2152
01:58:24,059 --> 01:58:25,619
But wait. Your fiance
will arrive now.

2153
01:59:09,749 --> 01:59:10,429
Welcome.

2154
01:59:11,270 --> 01:59:13,550
I thought you'll bring
more men along with you.

2155
01:59:16,956 --> 01:59:18,756
Look at that. A woman
alongside you!

2156
01:59:22,304 --> 01:59:24,144
So how's my future
father in law?

2157
01:59:24,353 --> 01:59:25,073
Don't worry baby.

2158
01:59:26,629 --> 01:59:27,749
I'll take care of you.

2159
01:59:28,758 --> 01:59:30,598
So looks like you are
missing your brother?

2160
01:59:31,225 --> 01:59:33,745
I wish I could reply
to all your questions.

2161
01:59:34,562 --> 01:59:35,480
But...

2162
01:59:35,505 --> 01:59:38,062
at the same time I wish you were dead.

2163
01:59:39,144 --> 01:59:40,310
Come on!

2164
02:00:01,445 --> 02:00:02,245
Hey you doofus!

2165
02:00:02,395 --> 02:00:04,395
Don't you know the drill?
Point the knife at my throat!

2166
02:00:04,420 --> 02:00:06,874
That will make him more
furious and powerful.

2167
02:00:06,899 --> 02:00:07,605
Do it.

2168
02:00:13,547 --> 02:00:14,791
I love you.

2169
02:00:19,456 --> 02:00:20,136
I love you.

2170
02:00:49,855 --> 02:00:51,768
Love you.

2171
02:00:59,543 --> 02:01:01,950
- What is it?
- Nothing.

2172
02:01:09,118 --> 02:01:10,158
I love you.

2173
02:01:47,245 --> 02:01:49,345
Doesn't even know to....

2174
02:01:49,370 --> 02:01:50,370
handle a knife!

2175
02:01:50,395 --> 02:01:51,195
Shall we leave?

2176
02:04:17,164 --> 02:04:17,884
Look at that.

2177
02:04:18,204 --> 02:04:20,324
You said he was merely a cat?

2178
02:04:21,622 --> 02:04:24,702
Cat and tiger belong to the same family.
From far they appear the same.

2179
02:04:24,979 --> 02:04:28,219
Only when it approaches, you
know what they really are.

2180
02:04:29,464 --> 02:04:30,464
If it is a cat...

2181
02:04:30,867 --> 02:04:31,787
or if it's a tiger.

2182
02:04:34,621 --> 02:04:35,621
Are you ok baby?

2183
02:04:36,152 --> 02:04:36,952
Yeah baby.

2184
02:04:41,316 --> 02:04:42,036
Shall we?

2185
02:04:42,421 --> 02:04:42,981
We shall.

2186
02:04:43,172 --> 02:04:43,892
Let's go.

2187
02:05:19,851 --> 02:05:20,411
Come.

2188
02:05:20,436 --> 02:05:22,196
No. I feel strange.

2189
02:05:23,334 --> 02:05:24,694
Don't you want to meet Selvam?

2190
02:05:25,465 --> 02:05:26,265
So get down.

2191
02:05:30,522 --> 02:05:31,122
- Wear it properly.
- Leave me.

2192
02:05:31,241 --> 02:05:32,448
Looks like you have a six pack.

2193
02:05:32,473 --> 02:05:34,873
These villagers treat me as retard.
Now why are you making me look so?

2194
02:05:34,986 --> 02:05:36,026
Why do you think so?

2195
02:05:36,051 --> 02:05:37,091
Don't you mock the politicians.

2196
02:05:37,116 --> 02:05:37,710
Is it my marriage?

2197
02:05:37,735 --> 02:05:38,895
It's Kavitha's wedding?

2198
02:05:38,920 --> 02:05:39,788
Wait and watch what
I'll do to you.

2199
02:05:39,813 --> 02:05:40,733
- What?
- Let Shiva arrive.

2200
02:05:40,758 --> 02:05:42,318
It was Shiva who asked
us to get you ready.

2201
02:05:42,343 --> 02:05:42,863
What?

2202
02:05:43,265 --> 02:05:43,905
Where is he?

2203
02:05:47,446 --> 02:05:48,086
Shiva!

2204
02:05:48,231 --> 02:05:49,711
Look at them. They are
get me all dressed up.

2205
02:05:49,736 --> 02:05:50,336
This fellow...

2206
02:06:13,781 --> 02:06:15,581
Where did you go off to?

2207
02:06:16,161 --> 02:06:18,121
Do you know, these
villagers thrashed me?

2208
02:06:18,674 --> 02:06:19,834
My dad passed away.

2209
02:06:20,488 --> 02:06:22,448
You could have left
me message at least.

2210
02:06:50,670 --> 02:06:52,723
How dare you miss my marriage?

2211
02:06:52,748 --> 02:06:54,309
- You betrayed me!
- Sorry.

2212
02:06:54,334 --> 02:06:55,974
- Do not talk to me.
- Sorry. She is my sister.

2213
02:06:55,999 --> 02:06:57,839
- I'm very sorry dear.
- Ok.

2214
02:06:57,864 --> 02:06:59,144
Are you happy Ms. Bride?

2215
02:06:59,169 --> 02:06:59,969
- Shiva?
- Dad...

2216
02:07:00,707 --> 02:07:01,227
Sorry dad.

2217
02:07:01,357 --> 02:07:01,957
For what?

2218
02:07:03,071 --> 02:07:03,831
Why are you hurt?

2219
02:07:03,951 --> 02:07:05,013
It's nothing.

2220
02:07:05,045 --> 02:07:06,765
- I hope everything is solved.
- Indeed.

2221
02:07:07,973 --> 02:07:08,613
Bro...

2222
02:07:08,975 --> 02:07:10,175
sorry I couldn't make it.

2223
02:07:10,200 --> 02:07:11,240
- Forgive me.
- It's ok.

2224
02:07:11,599 --> 02:07:12,919
Look. Mala.

2225
02:07:13,114 --> 02:07:15,594
It's ok dear brother in law.

2226
02:07:15,619 --> 02:07:16,159
Don't cry.

2227
02:07:16,184 --> 02:07:16,864
Mala.

2228
02:07:18,743 --> 02:07:19,823
How have you been?

2229
02:07:19,848 --> 02:07:20,648
Shiva...

2230
02:07:20,673 --> 02:07:21,193
Yes dad?

2231
02:07:21,218 --> 02:07:23,258
Are you finally relieved
of your haunting past?

2232
02:07:24,285 --> 02:07:24,965
Selvam...

2233
02:07:25,997 --> 02:07:27,397
Will you take Mala?

2234
02:07:28,258 --> 02:07:29,458
I mean will you marry her?

2235
02:07:29,878 --> 02:07:31,504
So was this all set up for me?

2236
02:07:31,529 --> 02:07:32,889
Indeed, it's for you.

2237
02:07:33,227 --> 02:07:34,307
He finally understood!

2238
02:07:35,419 --> 02:07:37,419
Sure. I'll marry her.

2239
02:08:10,210 --> 02:08:13,730
Did you notice that northern girl? He has got
a daughter in law for you to fight with.

2240
02:08:14,856 --> 02:08:16,576
She is taller than you.

2241
02:08:19,076 --> 02:08:20,396
Oh! Oh!

2242
02:08:20,631 --> 02:08:25,257
Even parents wouldn't have
cared for me so much.

2243
02:08:25,282 --> 02:08:25,962
Also...

2244
02:08:26,212 --> 02:08:30,092
it's siblings who are
there for us forever.

2245
02:08:31,454 --> 02:08:34,854
Will you be there for me always?

2246
02:08:35,864 --> 02:08:36,744
Mala...

2247
02:08:37,284 --> 02:08:39,804
don't question me the obvious.

2248
02:08:40,199 --> 02:08:40,759
Got it?

2249
02:08:42,017 --> 02:08:44,057
I only have one answer
for all your questions.

2250
02:08:44,818 --> 02:08:45,338
I...

2251
02:08:46,054 --> 02:08:46,974
always...

2252
02:08:47,790 --> 02:08:48,870
love my sister, Mala.

2253
02:08:49,188 --> 02:08:51,084
I love you Mala.

2254
02:08:53,286 --> 02:08:53,766
Don't cry.

2255
02:08:54,766 --> 02:08:55,646
Stop crying.

2256
02:08:56,352 --> 02:08:57,232
Stay happy always.

2257
02:08:57,825 --> 02:08:58,985
You will be happy always.

2258
02:09:06,548 --> 02:09:07,948
Now what are you up to?

2259
02:09:31,617 --> 02:09:32,817
Shiva! Shiva!

2260
02:09:32,973 --> 02:09:35,093
Did you elope with some big
shot's daughter from Madurai?

2261
02:09:35,118 --> 02:09:37,078
Thousands of his men are here.

2262
02:09:37,103 --> 02:09:37,823
Come fast.

2263
02:10:13,292 --> 02:10:13,932
Hi.

2264
02:10:14,494 --> 02:10:15,734
Did you forget to
inform your dad?

2265
02:10:15,759 --> 02:10:17,159
That is why is he is so upset.

2266
02:10:17,479 --> 02:10:20,039
Next time inform him
while eloping. Ok?

2267
02:10:21,855 --> 02:10:22,375
Bharathi...

2268
02:10:22,598 --> 02:10:23,638
is that your dad?

2269
02:10:24,224 --> 02:10:25,944
Ask him if we can sit and talk.
Please.

2270
02:10:26,939 --> 02:10:28,539
Stop kidding.

2271
02:10:28,724 --> 02:10:31,044
You risk your life to
unite couples elsewhere.

2272
02:10:31,222 --> 02:10:33,462
And you thought ours will
be a walk in the park?

2273
02:10:34,843 --> 02:10:35,723
Go! Bash them up!

2274
02:10:36,491 --> 02:10:37,491
This is our love story.

2275
02:10:37,861 --> 02:10:40,021
I want to see you bash
them up for our love.

2276
02:10:40,096 --> 02:10:40,816
Go!

2277
02:10:43,375 --> 02:10:45,215
He is the one who
abducted your daughter.

2278
02:10:45,316 --> 02:10:47,796
He took her away when
no one was around.

2279
02:10:48,432 --> 02:10:49,952
Go teach him a lesson.

2280
02:10:53,194 --> 02:10:54,794
I'll return it in two mins sir.
Please.
