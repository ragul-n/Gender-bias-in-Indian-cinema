2
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:42,208
Get me Needhi's case ﬁle.

3
00:02:53,556 --> 00:02:54,523
Sir.

4
00:03:11,174 --> 00:03:15,509
Sir, these pages will only
give you one side of the story.

5
00:03:16,312 --> 00:03:17,245
Really?

6
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:20,678
Then why don't you give
me the other side of this story.

7
00:03:23,987 --> 00:03:26,684
It's a very old story, sir.
Let me tell you.

8
00:04:02,692 --> 00:04:05,127
" I am the fragrance
lingering in the Wind"

9
00:04:05,228 --> 00:04:07,458
"  I ﬂow freewheelingly."

10
00:04:07,563 --> 00:04:10,055
"  I only listen to my heart."

11
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,396
"  I make my own path."

12
00:04:12,568 --> 00:04:15,003
"  I am the fragrance
lingering in the Wind"

13
00:04:15,104 --> 00:04:17,505
"  I ﬂow freewheelingly."

14
00:04:17,607 --> 00:04:19,974
"  I only listen to my heart."

15
00:04:20,076 --> 00:04:22,443
"  I make my own path."

16
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:49,596
"  Wherever I go, I seek happiness."

17
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:54,940
"  If I come across any,
I keep spreading it all around."

18
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:04,483
"  Wherever I go, I seek happiness."

19
00:05:04,587 --> 00:05:09,354
"  If I come across any,
I keep spreading it all around."

20
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:11,985
"  I cannot be stopped."

21
00:05:12,161 --> 00:05:14,493
"  I am wild river."

22
00:05:14,597 --> 00:05:16,929
"  I am the fragrance
lingering in the Wind"

23
00:05:17,033 --> 00:05:19,365
"  I ﬂow freewheelingly."

24
00:05:19,469 --> 00:05:21,665
"  I only listen to my heart."

25
00:05:21,971 --> 00:05:24,599
"  I make my own path."

26
00:05:44,327 --> 00:05:48,992
"  I won't and cannot live
worrying about the world."

27
00:05:49,165 --> 00:05:51,497
"  I make my own principles."

28
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:54,627
"  I don't fear anyone."

29
00:05:59,075 --> 00:06:03,911
"  I won't and cannot live
worrying about the world."

30
00:06:04,013 --> 00:06:06,414
"  I make my own principles."

31
00:06:06,516 --> 00:06:08,644
"  I don't fear anyone."

32
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:13,616
"  I go and pray to God every day."

33
00:06:14,023 --> 00:06:16,355
"  I am the fragrance
lingering in the Wind"

34
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,894
"  I ﬂow freewheelingly."

35
00:06:18,995 --> 00:06:21,293
"  I only listen to my heart."

36
00:06:21,397 --> 00:06:23,593
"  I make my own path."

37
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:26,259
"  I am the fragrance
lingering in the Wind"

38
00:06:26,369 --> 00:06:28,531
"  I ﬂow freewheelingly."

39
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:31,164
"  I only listen to my heart."

40
00:06:31,274 --> 00:06:34,209
"  I make my own path."

41
00:06:40,349 --> 00:06:41,510
Father!

42
00:06:44,253 --> 00:06:45,652
Father!

43
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:50,025
Coming, dear.

44
00:06:57,533 --> 00:07:00,195
I am once again late today.
What excuse do I make?

45
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,604
My child is ﬁnally here.

46
00:07:03,306 --> 00:07:06,435
I got a little late today.
Please forgive me.

47
00:07:06,542 --> 00:07:07,407
It's okay.

48
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:11,003
Judges are late sometimes.

49
00:07:11,614 --> 00:07:15,448
The judge orders you to
stop talking and stall eating.

50
00:07:15,551 --> 00:07:18,646
Dear, I feel sated
as soon as I see your face.

51
00:07:19,622 --> 00:07:22,319
Then from tomorrow,
you will only get my face.

52
00:07:22,658 --> 00:07:24,490
Okay, whatever my Needhi says.

53
00:07:25,995 --> 00:07:29,124
Father, why did you name me Needhi?

54
00:07:29,966 --> 00:07:32,401
Some villagers call me Needhi
and some call me Needhi.

55
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,397
Don't bother about the villagers.

56
00:07:34,637 --> 00:07:36,628
You are my precious daughter.

57
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,404
- What does Needhi mean?
- Treasure.

58
00:07:39,509 --> 00:07:43,173
- And you are my treasure.
- Yes, father!

59
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:45,543
You have given me a very nice name.

60
00:07:46,015 --> 00:07:47,278
Food is a little cold.

61
00:07:49,285 --> 00:07:50,309
Very tasty.

62
00:07:50,486 --> 00:07:53,456
Yes, I will tell mother.
She will be very happy.

63
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,657
I will eat it.

64
00:07:58,961 --> 00:08:00,622
Okay. You eat. I will be right back.

65
00:08:05,001 --> 00:08:09,268
Be careful, dear.
The ﬁrst gear gets struck.

66
00:08:09,505 --> 00:08:10,870
Don't worry, father.

67
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,497
I will go to third
on low and pull it up.

68
00:08:55,651 --> 00:08:57,676
Wonderful!

69
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,088
Today you started the
match without the captain?

70
00:09:00,489 --> 00:09:01,979
- Where did she come from?
- It's okay.

71
00:09:02,158 --> 00:09:03,182
Give me the bat.

72
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:04,885
At least let me play my mm.

73
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:06,625
Give me the bat.

74
00:09:07,096 --> 00:09:08,860
Go and ﬁeld.

75
00:09:09,265 --> 00:09:10,994
And don't you dare catch me out.

76
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,059
She thinks she is Sachin Tendulkar!

77
00:09:13,502 --> 00:09:15,197
She will hit sixers?

78
00:09:17,106 --> 00:09:17,971
Come on.

79
00:09:21,377 --> 00:09:23,368
No, it was a trial ball.

80
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:27,412
It was a trial ball.
Go and ball.

81
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,948
How can I be out just like that?

82
00:09:48,437 --> 00:09:50,906
Throw her a full toss ball.

83
00:10:06,989 --> 00:10:09,356
Sister, go and get the
ball from that crazy Woman.

84
00:10:14,463 --> 00:10:15,362
Hold this.

85
00:10:18,334 --> 00:10:21,167
- What do you think, will she get the ball?
- Yes.

86
00:10:22,004 --> 00:10:23,631
Aunt, please give me the ball.

87
00:10:23,739 --> 00:10:24,638
Why?

88
00:10:25,174 --> 00:10:27,165
What if it would've hit my head?

89
00:10:27,576 --> 00:10:31,479
She is of marriageable
age and yet she plays with kids.

90
00:10:32,315 --> 00:10:37,185
- Who will play with these kids if I get married?
- Yes.

91
00:10:37,286 --> 00:10:38,447
Right?

92
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:41,720
Stupid.

93
00:10:42,024 --> 00:10:44,618
<i>And aunt, ﬁn learn how to eat!</i>

94
00:10:45,027 --> 00:10:46,517
Ladoo, I got the ball.

95
00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:36,371
Don't try to get friendly with me.

96
00:11:36,979 --> 00:11:37,969
Understood?

97
00:11:45,154 --> 00:11:46,178
Mother!

98
00:11:46,522 --> 00:11:49,548
You are back! Come in.

99
00:11:49,658 --> 00:11:52,150
The kids stopped me.

100
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:55,726
They asked me to teach them cricket.
I said ﬁne.

101
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,156
Right?

102
00:11:57,266 --> 00:11:59,064
Let it be, dear. Let it be.

103
00:11:59,168 --> 00:12:01,262
What the priest predicted
upon your birth was right.

104
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:03,031
That you have itchy feet.

105
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:05,471
That's why you keep loitering
around in the village.

106
00:12:05,574 --> 00:12:07,406
Stay homes sometimes.

107
00:12:07,576 --> 00:12:08,475
Needhi!!

108
00:12:09,578 --> 00:12:11,103
What happened, aunt?

109
00:12:11,547 --> 00:12:14,573
Forget everything else.

110
00:12:14,717 --> 00:12:19,154
Shanno, ﬁrst tell me
where are you planning to go!

111
00:12:19,255 --> 00:12:20,484
You are all decked up.

112
00:12:20,589 --> 00:12:22,921
Today is the last day
of Ramleela in this village.

113
00:12:23,025 --> 00:12:24,254
I thought we should go and watch it.

114
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,521
Go and watch it.

115
00:12:25,628 --> 00:12:27,926
Take your army of monkeys with you.

116
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:29,495
They must have already
reached there, mother.

117
00:12:29,632 --> 00:12:31,293
- Let's go.
- Wait!

118
00:12:31,567 --> 00:12:32,659
First go and get ready.

119
00:12:32,968 --> 00:12:35,562
I fear that Ravana might
get scared after looking at you.

120
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:37,230
- Mother!
- Wear decent clothes. Go.

121
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:39,433
- Go my child. Go.
- Go.

122
00:12:40,309 --> 00:12:42,573
Shanno, from where
did you get this dress?!

123
00:12:42,745 --> 00:12:44,611
From the market, aunt.

124
00:12:49,385 --> 00:12:51,285
Hail Lord Rama!

125
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,654
Hail Lord Rama!

126
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:56,554
Hail Lord Rama!

127
00:12:56,659 --> 00:12:59,492
Hail Lord Rama!

128
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:08,136
Hail Lord Rama!

129
00:13:08,237 --> 00:13:10,228
Hail Lord Rama!

130
00:13:13,409 --> 00:13:14,968
Hail Lord Rama!

131
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:22,040
Your sins have crossed
all limits, Ravana.

132
00:13:22,184 --> 00:13:24,915
Today you will die ..

133
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:31,149
Hail Lord Rama! Lord Rama“?

134
00:13:32,328 --> 00:13:33,659
Shoot the arrow.

135
00:13:33,963 --> 00:13:34,930
Shoot the arrow!

136
00:13:35,197 --> 00:13:36,164
Hail Lord Rama!

137
00:13:36,265 --> 00:13:37,357
Shoot... Lord Rama!

138
00:13:40,703 --> 00:13:43,400
Lord Rama! Shoot the arrow!

139
00:13:43,506 --> 00:13:46,134
- Shoot!
- Bhola, shoot!

140
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,937
Hail Lord Rama!
- Shoot the arrow.

141
00:13:48,043 --> 00:13:50,512
Shoot! Shoot the arrow already!

142
00:13:50,613 --> 00:13:53,082
Hail Lord Rama!
- Shoot the arrow.

143
00:13:59,121 --> 00:14:00,213
Ravana didn't die!

144
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:05,120
Hail Lord Rama!

145
00:14:05,227 --> 00:14:07,025
Hail Lord Rama!

146
00:14:32,321 --> 00:14:33,152
Subh?!

147
00:14:43,065 --> 00:14:45,159
Subh, you are looking
very pretty today.

148
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,998
- I look pretty every day.
- You are light.

149
00:14:48,237 --> 00:14:49,636
I have not seen anyone
more beautiful..

150
00:14:49,738 --> 00:14:51,433
..and courageous than
you in this village.

151
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,304
Yes, of course. I am a Punjabi.

152
00:14:58,113 --> 00:14:59,171
She is right.

153
00:15:16,699 --> 00:15:19,396
Here's a ripe mango, brother.

154
00:15:20,035 --> 00:15:24,472
Forget the ripe mango,
raw mangoes taste better.

155
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:28,543
If you are tired then
let me drop you in the car.

156
00:15:29,244 --> 00:15:30,939
Nothing to say!
Gore, look at the speed.

157
00:15:31,046 --> 00:15:31,638
Yes, brother.

158
00:15:32,314 --> 00:15:34,942
- They put a bike to shame.
- You are right, brother.

159
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:36,540
Have some shame.

160
00:15:36,719 --> 00:15:39,381
Shame? You want me
to hide my face now?

161
00:15:41,991 --> 00:15:43,322
Why are you arguing with them!

162
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:44,959
Don't. Let's go.

163
00:15:47,162 --> 00:15:49,358
- Forget it, brother.
- Why bother!

164
00:15:49,465 --> 00:15:51,126
We need to go see the
land record keeper as well.

165
00:15:51,967 --> 00:15:54,265
Who will say that
he's the headman's son?

166
00:15:59,975 --> 00:16:03,570
Officer, I hope you know him.

167
00:16:04,013 --> 00:16:05,481
Brother Lali.

168
00:16:05,948 --> 00:16:07,609
Headman's younger brother.

169
00:16:10,252 --> 00:16:12,152
We will skip the
introductions for now.

170
00:16:13,122 --> 00:16:14,590
Coming to the point..

171
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:18,285
"  you know that someone
is ready to buy the common land.

172
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,256
Why are you being stubborn?

173
00:16:20,663 --> 00:16:22,290
Let the deal take place.

174
00:16:22,498 --> 00:16:27,459
The whole village will suffer
if the common land is sold.

175
00:16:28,137 --> 00:16:29,935
But I will beneﬁt from it.

176
00:16:31,006 --> 00:16:33,441
You take your commission and enjoy.

177
00:16:33,542 --> 00:16:36,102
What's the use of getting
into mess at this age?

178
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:39,046
Brother Lali, this is an official job.

179
00:16:40,983 --> 00:16:42,644
And it will take place
in an official manner.

180
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,253
All you need to do is say yes.

181
00:16:48,023 --> 00:16:50,390
[Will you say yes or
should I force you 10']

182
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:53,925
Brother Lali..

183
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,095
He is just like family.

184
00:16:56,565 --> 00:16:58,556
Let's give him a few days to think.

185
00:16:58,701 --> 00:17:00,567
Then we will see
what needs to be done.

186
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:02,867
Okay, let's see.

187
00:17:07,976 --> 00:17:09,171
You are good at talking
about these things.

188
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,609
You never pay attention
towards your studies.

189
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,046
I don't want to hear any
complaint about you next time.

190
00:17:13,382 --> 00:17:14,213
Do you understand me?

191
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:20,149
Father, who were they?

192
00:17:21,056 --> 00:17:23,320
No one, dear. Go inside.

193
00:17:23,692 --> 00:17:24,386
Yes.

194
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:35,529
Great! Great! I am a born DJ!

195
00:17:36,071 --> 00:17:37,061
Chotu!

196
00:17:37,172 --> 00:17:40,233
How many times have I told
you to dust the big speakers with car!

197
00:17:40,442 --> 00:17:43,139
I respect these speakers
more than I respect my real father.

198
00:17:43,245 --> 00:17:44,906
It is my business.

199
00:17:45,214 --> 00:17:47,114
Moniya! Take a DJ booking for tonight.

200
00:17:47,216 --> 00:17:48,581
What's the occasion?

201
00:17:48,684 --> 00:17:51,449
India winning the world cup.

202
00:17:51,954 --> 00:17:53,149
Don't make me laugh.

203
00:17:53,355 --> 00:17:56,450
They cannot even win the toss
how will they will the world cup?

204
00:17:56,558 --> 00:17:59,050
Sri Lanka's team is in full form.

205
00:17:59,261 --> 00:18:01,161
They keep hitting
boundaries and sixes.

206
00:18:01,396 --> 00:18:02,886
- She thinks India will win!
- Hello!

207
00:18:03,298 --> 00:18:05,960
You are Ravana only in the
Ramleela and not in real life.

208
00:18:06,135 --> 00:18:07,432
Stop taking Sri Lanka's side.

209
00:18:07,603 --> 00:18:09,537
India will win today.
I am ready to bet on it.

210
00:18:09,638 --> 00:18:11,163
- Then let's place a bet.
- No.

211
00:18:12,574 --> 00:18:13,473
How about this?

212
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:14,972
Let's place a bet.

213
00:18:15,077 --> 00:18:18,445
If India wins,
I will DJ at your house for free.

214
00:18:18,547 --> 00:18:19,480
- How about that?
- Promise?

215
00:18:19,581 --> 00:18:20,480
- Promise.
- Really?

216
00:18:20,582 --> 00:18:21,174
Really.

217
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,374
Then stall making preparations.

218
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:26,120
"  Start making preparations.
India will win!"

219
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,289
Go and dust that.

220
00:18:36,098 --> 00:18:37,065
Let's go!

221
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:38,633
No one will interrupt.

222
00:18:38,934 --> 00:18:41,562
Ladoo, hold my phone.
Give it to me only after India wins.

223
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:42,501
Sister, I need to pee.

224
00:18:42,604 --> 00:18:44,629
- Sit down, Bheema.
- Okay.

225
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:48,977
Oh no.

226
00:18:49,244 --> 00:18:51,042
What is he doing?

227
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,238
I really need to go.

228
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:53,576
Sit down, Bheema.

229
00:18:56,985 --> 00:18:58,919
Oh no, Sachin is out!

230
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,213
I had told you not to get up.

231
00:19:02,591 --> 00:19:03,922
Shanno, hold onto him.

232
00:19:04,026 --> 00:19:05,619
Don't you dare get up now.

233
00:19:10,265 --> 00:19:12,165
Look at your darling daughter.

234
00:19:12,334 --> 00:19:14,098
We are worried about her marriage..

235
00:19:14,203 --> 00:19:16,069
And she is worried
about Sachin Tedakooler.

236
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:20,634
Not Tedakooler, Tendulkar.

237
00:19:20,943 --> 00:19:21,569
Whatever.

238
00:19:21,677 --> 00:19:23,611
Why are you after her life?

239
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,604
<i>I am not after her life.</i>

240
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:28,178
Just tell her that a prospective..

241
00:19:28,283 --> 00:19:30,251
“groom's family is
coming to see her tomorrow.

242
00:19:30,352 --> 00:19:33,378
Forget about the groom's family,
India is winning.

243
00:19:33,655 --> 00:19:37,091
Oh no. Both of you are just the same.

244
00:19:37,192 --> 00:19:38,387
We will win for sure now.

245
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:41,119
Hit! Hit! Hit!

246
00:19:44,366 --> 00:19:46,357
Well done!
Go for it!

247
00:19:46,635 --> 00:19:47,625
That was great.

248
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:50,495
Ladoo, give me the phone.

249
00:19:57,079 --> 00:20:00,913
Moniya! You saw?
India won! I had told you so!

250
00:20:01,016 --> 00:20:02,211
Come here with your equipment.

251
00:20:02,317 --> 00:20:04,149
Needhi!, I will call you later.

252
00:20:04,386 --> 00:20:06,616
Not later. You forgot the bet?

253
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:10,414
I remember our bet but I
have to play at the headman's house.

254
00:20:10,659 --> 00:20:12,149
Now I will have to
be the DJ over here.

255
00:20:12,327 --> 00:20:13,192
Hang up now.

256
00:20:20,669 --> 00:20:23,138
Bhaja, try escaping now.

257
00:20:23,338 --> 00:20:25,363
Here comes my knight.

258
00:20:29,211 --> 00:20:31,043
I know it can only move
three spaces in L shape.

259
00:20:31,213 --> 00:20:33,238
But this is my knight-
I can make it move wherever I want.

260
00:20:35,751 --> 00:20:37,549
Damn you.

261
00:20:38,453 --> 00:20:40,353
Bhaja, this game
isn't your cup of tea.

262
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:41,714
What have you gotten yourself into?

263
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:45,025
Brother, you already have the ticket.

264
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,121
As soon as you become the MLA..

265
00:20:48,063 --> 00:20:51,055
We will make our knight move 10 steps.

266
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,525
Have you lost your mind!

267
00:20:53,769 --> 00:20:56,170
If l have to cheat people
after becoming the MLA..

268
00:20:56,538 --> 00:20:58,973
Then what is the difference
between others and me?

269
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:01,402
You and your principles.

270
00:21:02,277 --> 00:21:03,540
Okay, forget about everything.

271
00:21:03,712 --> 00:21:05,305
Let's go and dance.

272
00:21:05,414 --> 00:21:07,007
I have made all the
arrangements to celebrate.

273
00:21:07,582 --> 00:21:09,209
- Come.
- Coming.

274
00:21:09,584 --> 00:21:10,676
Coming.

275
00:21:12,721 --> 00:21:14,348
Let go. Let's go.

276
00:21:22,664 --> 00:21:25,258
Watch this drama unfold!
It will be fun.

277
00:21:26,735 --> 00:21:31,468
- He didn't show up yesterday.
- He deserves this punishment.

278
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,334
- Yes.
- Very good.

279
00:21:33,642 --> 00:21:34,632
Move your waist a little.

280
00:21:34,743 --> 00:21:36,643
More vigor.

281
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,044
With a veil!

282
00:21:46,755 --> 00:21:48,018
Stop it, sister.

283
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:50,386
I haven't made people
dance with my music"  .

284
00:21:50,492 --> 00:21:52,051
As much as you are
making me dance today.

285
00:21:52,294 --> 00:21:53,625
Then you should have
made us dance yesterday.

286
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:54,525
But you didn't show up.

287
00:21:54,629 --> 00:21:56,654
I am telling you why.

288
00:21:56,999 --> 00:21:59,331
Not like this, dance and tell me.

289
00:22:01,536 --> 00:22:02,230
Shut up.

290
00:22:02,671 --> 00:22:04,105
Let me tell the truth.

291
00:22:04,373 --> 00:22:08,606
I knew how serious Gambhir was when
he was hitting boundaries and sixes.

292
00:22:09,144 --> 00:22:11,135
I understood that I
was going to lose the bet.

293
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:14,610
I gathered all the equipment
and left for your house.

294
00:22:15,017 --> 00:22:17,639
But on the way,
headman's men took me to his house.

295
00:22:17,719 --> 00:22:18,686
I was helpless.

296
00:22:20,355 --> 00:22:22,323
He too couldn't enjoy the DJ.

297
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,319
You had removed the fuse?

298
00:22:29,031 --> 00:22:31,022
What order do you have for me now?

299
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:33,393
I will tell you.

300
00:22:34,736 --> 00:22:38,229
- Look, a marriage broker introduces two families to each other.
- Yes.

301
00:22:38,407 --> 00:22:39,568
They are the boy's parents.

302
00:22:40,642 --> 00:22:41,575
Hello.

303
00:22:41,676 --> 00:22:43,144
And he is the NRI boy.

304
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:44,310
Hello.

305
00:22:45,313 --> 00:22:48,613
Our daughter is well-educated.

306
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:50,585
She has a bachelor's degree in arts.

307
00:22:50,685 --> 00:22:52,517
Yes, she has a bachelor's
degree in arts.

308
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:55,352
Fine, but what can she do?

309
00:22:56,224 --> 00:22:58,955
- My son is a NRI.
- Yes.

310
00:22:59,061 --> 00:23:00,620
He is a NRI.

311
00:23:03,031 --> 00:23:06,001
She knows all the household work.

312
00:23:06,101 --> 00:23:08,502
Yes, she knows all the household work.

313
00:23:08,703 --> 00:23:11,570
Fine, but what can she do?

314
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:15,902
My son is a NRI.

315
00:23:16,111 --> 00:23:17,442
He is an NRI for sure.

316
00:23:17,946 --> 00:23:19,004
Have some.

317
00:23:19,414 --> 00:23:21,576
She is good at crochet.

318
00:23:21,683 --> 00:23:23,981
Yes, she is good at crochet.

319
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:27,087
Fine, but what can she do?

320
00:23:27,622 --> 00:23:29,112
My son is a NRI.

321
00:23:29,257 --> 00:23:32,625
She is right. He is an NRI for sure.

322
00:23:33,628 --> 00:23:35,357
I will be ﬁghtback.

323
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:43,667
Where did she go?

324
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:45,670
She will be ﬁghtback.

325
00:23:46,641 --> 00:23:48,541
Serve them some snacks.

326
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:51,304
- They didn't have any snacks.
- Here, enjoy some snacks.

327
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:59,951
"  A prospective groom's
family has come to meet me."

328
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:07,022
"  They are very happy
and well-dressed too."

329
00:24:10,265 --> 00:24:14,566
"  A prospective groom's
family has come to meet me."

330
00:24:14,669 --> 00:24:18,037
"  They are very happy
and well-dressed too."

331
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:20,629
"  As if they will take
me with them today itself."

332
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,939
"  If only I would agree that easily."

333
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:26,309
"  Then everyone would've
sent marriage proposals home."

334
00:24:26,414 --> 00:24:28,439
"  If only I would agree that easily."

335
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:31,918
"  Then the whole of Punjab would've
sent marriage proposals home."

336
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:35,513
"  If only I would agree that easily."

337
00:24:51,373 --> 00:24:55,003
"  I have my own ﬂair and style."

338
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:59,008
"  I live like a king."

339
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:06,212
"  I have my own ﬂair and style."

340
00:25:06,321 --> 00:25:09,621
"  I live like a king."

341
00:25:10,058 --> 00:25:12,390
"  I won't belong to just anyone."

342
00:25:12,527 --> 00:25:14,495
"  If only I would agree that easily."

343
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:18,032
"  Then the whole of Punjab would've
sent marriage proposals home."

344
00:25:18,133 --> 00:25:20,124
"  If only I would agree that easily."

345
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:23,465
"  Then the whole of Punjab would've
sent marriage proposals home."

346
00:25:23,572 --> 00:25:27,270
"  If only I would agree that easily."

347
00:25:39,321 --> 00:25:43,258
"  Hey boy, don't waste your time here."

348
00:25:43,391 --> 00:25:47,055
"  Go and show your
face to someone else."

349
00:25:50,198 --> 00:25:54,396
"  Hey boy, don't waste your time here."

350
00:25:54,502 --> 00:25:57,369
"  Go and show your
face to someone else."

351
00:25:57,472 --> 00:26:00,305
"  Go and Hap someone else."

352
00:26:00,408 --> 00:26:02,536
"  If only I would agree that easily."

353
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:06,046
"  Then the whole of Punjab would've
sent marriage proposals home."

354
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:08,172
"  If only I would agree that easily."

355
00:26:08,283 --> 00:26:11,548
"  Then the whole of Punjab would've
sent marriage proposals home."

356
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:15,214
"  If only I would agree that easily."

357
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:18,917
"  If only I would agree that easily."

358
00:26:19,027 --> 00:26:23,464
"  If only I would agree that easily."

359
00:26:28,136 --> 00:26:29,035
Nice photo.

360
00:26:29,137 --> 00:26:30,571
He has to look nice,
after all he is my brother.

361
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:39,511
So.- both of you
are busy chitchatting.

362
00:26:39,614 --> 00:26:41,139
Right. Look at this.

363
00:26:41,483 --> 00:26:42,637
We were talking about you.

364
00:26:42,717 --> 00:26:44,412
Wonderful.

365
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:45,676
Keep it aside.

366
00:26:46,087 --> 00:26:47,919
How are your preparations
of the election going one?

367
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:49,286
The preparations are
right in front of you.

368
00:26:49,457 --> 00:26:50,982
It is on in full swing.

369
00:26:51,092 --> 00:26:53,026
- Any competition?
- None what so ever.

370
00:26:53,295 --> 00:26:54,126
- For sure?
- For sure.

371
00:26:54,262 --> 00:26:55,229
Listen, come with me.

372
00:26:55,497 --> 00:26:56,157
Lali?

373
00:26:56,298 --> 00:26:57,697
I had ask you to submit the weapons.

374
00:26:58,133 --> 00:26:59,066
Why didn't you!

375
00:26:59,267 --> 00:27:00,291
What is the need, brother?

376
00:27:00,969 --> 00:27:04,200
Listen careful, you should
stay calm during election time.

377
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:06,363
The queen doesn't need
to everyone who it is.

378
00:27:06,608 --> 00:27:07,632
Its move says it all.

379
00:27:08,009 --> 00:27:09,977
Do one thing. Tomorrow
submit your weapons without fail.

380
00:27:10,078 --> 00:27:10,476
Sure.

381
00:27:10,578 --> 00:27:11,636
- Okay?
- Yes-For sure.

382
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:13,173
Hello, headman.

383
00:27:13,281 --> 00:27:15,443
Hello, head master.

384
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,450
What brings you to my humble abode?

385
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:19,944
I needed your advice.

386
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:21,079
Yes, tell me.

387
00:27:21,356 --> 00:27:26,556
If we open a primary school
in the common land in our village“.

388
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:29,128
Then we will have
a school in this village.

389
00:27:29,264 --> 00:27:31,130
And it will be easier for
the kids to commute as well.

390
00:27:32,634 --> 00:27:35,399
You spoke my thoughts out aloud.

391
00:27:35,937 --> 00:27:38,599
I Wanted to discuss this
matter with you instead.

392
00:27:38,707 --> 00:27:39,936
- Headmaster.
- Yes.

393
00:27:40,041 --> 00:27:42,476
Do one thing. Tell the land
record keeper about it. -Damn.

394
00:27:42,644 --> 00:27:43,372
- Okay, I will talk to him.
- Okay?!

395
00:27:43,478 --> 00:27:45,674
We will stall the work as
soon as the elections are over.

396
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:46,635
okay-
- Okay.?-

397
00:27:46,715 --> 00:27:47,341
Anything else?

398
00:27:47,449 --> 00:27:48,075
No, thank you.

399
00:27:48,183 --> 00:27:49,582
- Okay, then bye.
- Bye.

400
00:28:00,195 --> 00:28:01,629
- These ones?
- Yes.

401
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:06,393
Chotu, make two cups of tea.
- Give half a kilo of Ladoos (SWEETS).

402
00:28:07,635 --> 00:28:10,002
I need to get to work
after getting my daily ﬁx.

403
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:18,573
- Uncle, sell candles instead of Samosas.
- Forget it.

404
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,876
They sell like hot cakes these days.

405
00:28:21,483 --> 00:28:24,043
These girls"
- They are getting angry.

406
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:26,318
- Here.
- Here's the money.

407
00:28:26,488 --> 00:28:27,978
- Let's go.
- Bye.

408
00:28:31,493 --> 00:28:32,483
Can't you see where you are going?

409
00:28:32,594 --> 00:28:34,653
If I couldn't, would I bang into you!

410
00:28:36,664 --> 00:28:37,426
Hold this.

411
00:28:39,501 --> 00:28:40,366
What!

412
00:28:43,671 --> 00:28:45,036
Now watch where you go.

413
00:28:48,076 --> 00:28:51,307
Needhi, why did you
have to mess with them?

414
00:29:10,465 --> 00:29:13,628
Officer! Officer!

415
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:15,302
Are you at home?

416
00:29:15,603 --> 00:29:16,570
Who is it?

417
00:29:17,238 --> 00:29:18,933
Brother Lali!

418
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,174
Come in.
Come in, brother Lali.

419
00:29:21,276 --> 00:29:22,038
Have a seat.

420
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:23,539
Forget the formalities.

421
00:29:23,912 --> 00:29:24,970
What have you decided?

422
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:29,109
Now nothing is in my hands.

423
00:29:29,651 --> 00:29:33,645
Because your brother has
promised to give the common land..

424
00:29:33,955 --> 00:29:35,889
.to a primary school
after he wins the election.

425
00:29:40,462 --> 00:29:41,657
You are so naive.

426
00:29:43,164 --> 00:29:45,462
No schools are built on disputed land.

427
00:29:45,967 --> 00:29:48,629
But there is no dispute
on the common land.

428
00:29:50,672 --> 00:29:52,197
Then form a dispute.

429
00:29:53,675 --> 00:29:56,667
Show a dispute on paper
and keep the land on hold.

430
00:29:57,712 --> 00:30:01,512
This is a little difficult.

431
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:05,346
The small never need to be told twice.

432
00:30:06,254 --> 00:30:07,449
The rest is up to you.

433
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,169
How can I keep quiet when
something happens with you?

434
00:30:23,171 --> 00:30:24,605
The officer's daughter. Stop.

435
00:30:24,706 --> 00:30:25,537
Reverse a little.

436
00:30:26,608 --> 00:30:27,939
Oh my.

437
00:30:30,712 --> 00:30:32,180
Where to, beautiful?

438
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:33,278
Let go of her hand.

439
00:30:34,015 --> 00:30:35,039
Wonderful.

440
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:36,476
Strong friendship I must say.

441
00:30:36,651 --> 00:30:38,619
I held her hand and it is hurting you.

442
00:30:40,154 --> 00:30:41,383
I said, let go of her hand.

443
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:43,048
What will you do?

444
00:30:44,459 --> 00:30:45,324
What will you do?

445
00:30:50,632 --> 00:30:52,157
Go and talk to your father.

446
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:55,031
Yes, brother?

447
00:31:01,342 --> 00:31:02,901
Balwant. - Yes.

448
00:31:03,011 --> 00:31:04,342
Clean this one as well.

449
00:31:11,352 --> 00:31:14,617
Sir, what is this! It has gone rusty.

450
00:31:14,722 --> 00:31:17,214
You should keep it on the holder.

451
00:31:20,695 --> 00:31:23,027
Only the cowards keep it there,
constable.

452
00:31:24,098 --> 00:31:26,362
Headman has been
generous to the village.

453
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:31,701
- There has been no such incidence where I required this.
- Yes sir.

454
00:31:32,106 --> 00:31:35,269
Sir, outside two girls
are insisting on meeting you.

455
00:31:35,443 --> 00:31:37,275
- Send them in.
- Okay, sir.

456
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:50,715
- Hello.
- Hello.

457
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:53,256
Sit down.

458
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:02,565
Inspector,
we wanted to ﬁle a complaint.

459
00:32:02,704 --> 00:32:04,263
Whom do you wish to complain against?

460
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:07,941
Headman's younger brother, Lali.

461
00:32:09,944 --> 00:32:12,970
He misbehaved with
my friend Shanno today.

462
00:32:14,415 --> 00:32:16,110
We don't lodge such complaints.

463
00:32:17,151 --> 00:32:17,947
Sir.

464
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:22,312
If not a permanent one,
we can at least lodge a temporary one.

465
00:32:22,657 --> 00:32:25,388
- I am talking to them.
- Sir.

466
00:32:31,332 --> 00:32:33,494
Look madam,
there is nothing to worry about.

467
00:32:34,268 --> 00:32:36,430
I will give him a warning.
He won't do it again.

468
00:32:36,971 --> 00:32:37,529
Okay?

469
00:32:39,107 --> 00:32:40,006
You may leave now.

470
00:32:41,175 --> 00:32:43,439
But our complaint can be registered.

471
00:32:44,012 --> 00:32:44,501
Really?

472
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:47,340
Now will you teach me law?

473
00:32:51,152 --> 00:32:52,119
Leave.

474
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,416
Let's go.

475
00:32:57,725 --> 00:32:58,954
Let's go.

476
00:33:07,702 --> 00:33:08,669
Yes, go on.

477
00:33:09,037 --> 00:33:11,938
Two girls had come to
lodge a complaint against you.

478
00:33:13,608 --> 00:33:16,305
I sent them away. If you say.

479
00:33:16,477 --> 00:33:17,467
No, no, no.

480
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:19,308
You don't do anything.

481
00:33:20,281 --> 00:33:21,248
I will take care of it.

482
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:24,244
Okay, sir. As you say.

483
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:35,655
- Aunt! How are you?
- Fine.

484
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:37,695
- Did you eat anything?
- No.

485
00:33:38,299 --> 00:33:41,064
Oh no. Take this.
I have brought fruit for you.

486
00:33:41,169 --> 00:33:41,965
Eat them.

487
00:33:43,204 --> 00:33:44,330
Where are you coming from?

488
00:33:44,539 --> 00:33:47,509
I just gave lunch to my father.

489
00:33:53,347 --> 00:33:54,337
Shanno?

490
00:33:54,716 --> 00:33:56,548
- Yes, tell me.
- How are you?

491
00:33:57,085 --> 00:33:59,019
- Fine.
- What were you doing?

492
00:33:59,754 --> 00:34:02,314
- I was with aunt.
- Okay.

493
00:34:03,257 --> 00:34:04,088
When are you coming to meet me!

494
00:34:04,225 --> 00:34:05,386
I will come soon.

495
00:34:05,927 --> 00:34:07,417
And don't just keep
watching the television.

496
00:34:07,562 --> 00:34:08,529
You have your exams tomorrow.

497
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:09,323
I hope you remember.

498
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:11,262
Yes, okay.

499
00:34:12,066 --> 00:34:13,500
Okay, I heard.

500
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:14,658
Hold on for a minute.

501
00:34:14,936 --> 00:34:16,131
Someone is at the door.

502
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:16,964
Okay.

503
00:34:25,046 --> 00:34:25,979
Where is your father?

504
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,309
He has gone to work.

505
00:34:27,582 --> 00:34:29,573
I will take care of him later.

506
00:34:31,352 --> 00:34:33,013
First let me take care of you.

507
00:34:33,187 --> 00:34:33,983
What do you mean?

508
00:34:34,288 --> 00:34:34,914
Shanno?

509
00:34:35,022 --> 00:34:38,117
I mean, I had just held your hand..

510
00:34:38,292 --> 00:34:39,623
And you ﬁled a complaint
with the police?

511
00:34:39,727 --> 00:34:40,956
Don't come forward.

512
00:34:41,195 --> 00:34:42,390
How dare you!

513
00:34:46,734 --> 00:34:50,329
Inspector was right.
We will have to clip her wings.

514
00:34:50,438 --> 00:34:51,667
- “What are you saying?
- Shanno'?

515
00:35:08,089 --> 00:35:09,284
Shanno who is at the door?

516
00:35:13,127 --> 00:35:14,617
- Needhi!
- Shanno!

517
00:35:15,163 --> 00:35:16,892
- Back off!
- Hello?

518
00:35:20,601 --> 00:35:22,899
Back.. Don't come forward.

519
00:35:26,674 --> 00:35:28,233
I said don't come forward

520
00:35:33,114 --> 00:35:34,047
Needhi!

521
00:36:25,299 --> 00:36:27,063
No.. No..

522
00:36:40,548 --> 00:36:43,483
- No..
- Get her!

523
00:36:49,724 --> 00:36:53,456
No! Let me go! No!

524
00:37:39,941 --> 00:37:41,409
Needhi!!

525
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:46,503
Shanno!

526
00:37:46,948 --> 00:37:48,006
Shanno!

527
00:37:50,084 --> 00:37:50,949
Shanno!

528
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:53,085
Shanno!

529
00:38:00,561 --> 00:38:03,030
Shanno! Shanno!

530
00:38:03,631 --> 00:38:04,928
We have almost reached.

531
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:06,363
How did this happen? Shanno.

532
00:38:06,467 --> 00:38:07,957
Nothing will happen to my child.

533
00:38:09,403 --> 00:38:12,270
Shanno, we have reached.

534
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:15,167
Don't worry, Shanno.

535
00:38:17,078 --> 00:38:17,943
Shanno.

536
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:22,247
Doctor! Doctor!

537
00:38:24,518 --> 00:38:25,451
Hurry up.

538
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:44,370
Oh God, what has happened to her!

539
00:38:44,705 --> 00:38:45,934
Don't cry.

540
00:38:47,975 --> 00:38:49,966
Will she make it, my child?

541
00:38:50,177 --> 00:38:53,272
What harm did my
daughter cause to anyone?

542
00:38:53,447 --> 00:38:56,610
- Don't worry.
- She never wished ill about anyone.

543
00:38:56,717 --> 00:38:57,946
- Excuse me.
- Doctor..

544
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:00,410
I am sorry. She is no more.

545
00:39:00,554 --> 00:39:03,421
Oh God!

546
00:39:06,327 --> 00:39:08,591
My child..

547
00:39:09,363 --> 00:39:10,922
Calm down. Be brave.

548
00:39:40,661 --> 00:39:41,651
Shanno

549
00:39:44,398 --> 00:39:45,422
Shanno

550
00:39:48,402 --> 00:39:49,392
Shanno

551
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,105
Shanno.

552
00:39:55,276 --> 00:39:56,675
<i>Please forgive me, Shanno.</i>

553
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,309
Please forgive me.

554
00:40:01,348 --> 00:40:03,146
I couldn't save you.

555
00:40:03,684 --> 00:40:05,584
Please forgive me.

556
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:11,215
<i>Please forgive me, Shanno.</i>

557
00:40:13,961 --> 00:40:16,589
Shanno Shanno.

558
00:40:18,132 --> 00:40:19,361
Oh God!

559
00:40:22,036 --> 00:40:22,969
Shanno.

560
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:39,285
Doctor..

561
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:41,313
What is that girl doing?

562
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:43,513
Sorry, we couldn't save her.

563
00:40:43,991 --> 00:40:44,981
Oh.

564
00:40:51,465 --> 00:40:53,297
<i>Write down the report.</i>

565
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:56,564
The girl died because
of electric shock.

566
00:40:57,104 --> 00:40:57,969
Okay?

567
00:40:58,372 --> 00:41:01,364
Don't you feel any
shame lying like that?

568
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:04,578
Shanno was raped!

569
00:41:05,446 --> 00:41:08,211
I think she is in a shock
because her friend died.

570
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:09,573
You continue writing.

571
00:41:11,018 --> 00:41:14,181
Madam, let us do our job.

572
00:41:15,322 --> 00:41:16,255
Understood?

573
00:41:17,158 --> 00:41:20,059
You better understand
or I will make you understand.

574
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:43,239
Excuse me..

575
00:41:45,386 --> 00:41:46,547
Here's the report.

576
00:41:50,491 --> 00:41:51,390
Whose report, doctor?

577
00:41:51,492 --> 00:41:53,221
Shanno's report.

578
00:41:56,397 --> 00:41:59,332
No matter what report the
police makes after post mortem.

579
00:42:00,067 --> 00:42:03,367
But I know that she
died due to brutal rape.

580
00:42:05,639 --> 00:42:09,098
I know that after this
I will be transferred for sure.

581
00:42:10,311 --> 00:42:14,214
Being a woman,
that's the only help I can give you.

582
00:42:14,548 --> 00:42:17,210
I hope this report is helpful to you.

583
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:19,317
Thank you, doctor.

584
00:42:20,487 --> 00:42:21,454
Thank you so much.

585
00:42:28,529 --> 00:42:30,190
This is Shanno's real report.

586
00:42:31,332 --> 00:42:33,096
But this too is of no use.

587
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:35,493
That inspector is
hand in glove with Lali.

588
00:42:36,003 --> 00:42:36,970
He won't do anything.

589
00:42:39,006 --> 00:42:42,670
I don't understand
whom should we go to.

590
00:42:43,277 --> 00:42:48,613
Needhi, there is one
person who can get us justice.

591
00:43:00,261 --> 00:43:01,251
Headman!

592
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:04,028
Headman!

593
00:43:09,069 --> 00:43:10,036
Let's go.

594
00:43:11,138 --> 00:43:12,128
You come with me.

595
00:43:22,616 --> 00:43:25,347
- You talk to him.
- Don't worry.

596
00:43:39,133 --> 00:43:40,430
Let's talk to him.

597
00:43:40,601 --> 00:43:43,161
Headman, we have come to you.

598
00:43:43,304 --> 00:43:44,430
Injustice has taken place with us.

599
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:45,937
What happened, tell me.

600
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:50,040
Headman, his daughter Shanno
used to stay in this village.

601
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:51,637
She was raped.

602
00:43:52,112 --> 00:43:53,944
Rape? Who raped her?

603
00:43:54,114 --> 00:43:55,309
Your younger brother Lali.

604
00:43:55,516 --> 00:43:56,642
Lali raped her!

605
00:43:56,984 --> 00:43:58,213
Why should I believe
that Lali raped her?

606
00:43:58,319 --> 00:43:59,184
I saw him!

607
00:43:59,286 --> 00:44:00,344
He had three men with him.

608
00:44:00,454 --> 00:44:02,081
They have brutally killed her.

609
00:44:02,289 --> 00:44:04,087
She died in the hospital.

610
00:44:04,224 --> 00:44:05,453
We have lodged many complaints.

611
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:06,549
We even told him.

612
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:08,025
But he didn't do anything.

613
00:44:08,128 --> 00:44:10,187
No, sir.
She died due to electric shock.

614
00:44:10,297 --> 00:44:11,264
She is lying.

615
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:13,965
Headman.

616
00:44:14,501 --> 00:44:16,026
Here is the real report.

617
00:44:26,547 --> 00:44:27,571
Lali!

618
00:44:30,017 --> 00:44:31,178
Lali!

619
00:44:32,519 --> 00:44:33,953
What happened? What's wrong?

620
00:44:38,192 --> 00:44:38,624
Yes, brother?

621
00:44:40,361 --> 00:44:42,455
I feel ashamed to call you my brother.

622
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:45,962
This is how you have repaid my love?

623
00:44:47,067 --> 00:44:47,625
Take him away!

624
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:49,235
I don't want to see his face.

625
00:44:49,336 --> 00:44:50,667
What are you doing?

626
00:44:58,512 --> 00:44:59,946
Officer.

627
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:03,340
I am ashamed for what
my brother has done.

628
00:45:04,051 --> 00:45:06,520
I cannot bring back
Shanno even if I want to.

629
00:45:07,054 --> 00:45:07,577
But yes..

630
00:45:09,256 --> 00:45:13,250
I promise all of you that
I will surely get her justice.

631
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:15,988
Just wait for a few days.

632
00:45:17,164 --> 00:45:19,223
As soon as the elections are oven.

633
00:45:21,268 --> 00:45:22,394
Headman..

634
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:26,572
Don't forget your promise
after becoming the MLA.

635
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,974
After all Lali is
your younger brother.

636
00:45:30,244 --> 00:45:31,370
Your own ﬂesh and blood.

637
00:45:35,449 --> 00:45:36,211
Let's go.

638
00:45:43,957 --> 00:45:45,254
One more thing.

639
00:45:45,559 --> 00:45:48,529
Shanno was not only my friend,
but also my sister.

640
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:54,466
If she doesn't get justice
then I will drag you to court.

641
00:46:15,289 --> 00:46:17,257
Affectionate greetings to all of you.

642
00:46:17,958 --> 00:46:20,427
First of all,
I would like to thank all of you“.

643
00:46:21,128 --> 00:46:25,087
Since the last three terms, you have
been making me Bhagomanjre's headman.

644
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:31,934
Thinking that, I contested as an MLA.

645
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:36,165
Because I want to lead
my area towards progress.

646
00:46:37,578 --> 00:46:39,945
I want schools to be opened here"  .

647
00:46:41,315 --> 00:46:42,339
Hospitals too..

648
00:46:43,083 --> 00:46:45,142
So that people don't
have to wander here and there.

649
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:50,317
I want an agriculture center here.

650
00:46:51,959 --> 00:46:54,985
So that they can test
our land and take samples"  .

651
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:56,424
Tell us about fertilizers.

652
00:46:56,997 --> 00:47:00,058
So that the produce
of our farmers increases.

653
00:47:03,637 --> 00:47:05,435
All this is only possible.

654
00:47:06,139 --> 00:47:09,268
you give me your precious
votes and make me the MLA.

655
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:13,038
I will fold my hands and
once again request all of you"  .

656
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:16,236
Please stamp on my
election symbol chess.

657
00:47:16,316 --> 00:47:18,148
And give me a chance to serve you.

658
00:47:34,301 --> 00:47:36,269
Hello.

659
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:39,531
Hello.

660
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:42,575
Yes.. Give me my slip.

661
00:47:53,487 --> 00:47:55,956
What happened with Shanno was wrong.

662
00:47:56,990 --> 00:47:58,151
Mother, you will see..

663
00:47:59,192 --> 00:48:02,457
God won't forgive the
one who did this to Shanno.

664
00:48:04,331 --> 00:48:08,063
But my child,
you should now look after yourself.

665
00:48:09,336 --> 00:48:11,168
The situation is still tense.

666
00:48:11,572 --> 00:48:12,505
Yes, dear.

667
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:15,139
You are our only daughter.

668
00:48:16,043 --> 00:48:20,139
God forbid if anything
happens then where will we go!

669
00:48:20,914 --> 00:48:21,881
Mother..

670
00:48:23,050 --> 00:48:25,075
- I'll go.
- No, I'll answer it.

671
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:33,419
My child,
the situation is still quite tense.

672
00:48:34,127 --> 00:48:35,595
I feel scared.

673
00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:38,564
You should take care of yourself.

674
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:41,498
Don't worry, mother.
Nothing will happen to me.

675
00:48:42,035 --> 00:48:44,504
I only worry about you.

676
00:48:45,272 --> 00:48:47,172
May God look after you.

677
00:48:48,942 --> 00:48:49,966
Hello.

678
00:48:50,143 --> 00:48:51,269
Hello, headman.

679
00:48:51,645 --> 00:48:55,013
Not headman. It's MLA Durjan Singh.

680
00:48:55,649 --> 00:48:58,311
I had promised justice
to you the other day.

681
00:48:58,685 --> 00:49:00,210
That's why I am here today.

682
00:49:01,054 --> 00:49:01,875
Where is that report?

683
00:49:01,955 --> 00:49:03,184
Where is that report?

684
00:49:04,324 --> 00:49:06,554
Needhi!, get the report.

685
00:49:09,396 --> 00:49:12,161
MLA sir, why did you take the trouble?

686
00:49:12,265 --> 00:49:13,289
You should have called for me.

687
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:15,093
No, I was the one who
had made the promise.

688
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:16,192
That's why I have come.

689
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:17,269
It doesn't make a difference.

690
00:49:31,418 --> 00:49:33,182
You were right.

691
00:49:34,354 --> 00:49:36,914
After all, he is my ﬂesh and blood.

692
00:49:55,509 --> 00:49:56,635
Lali!

693
00:50:01,148 --> 00:50:02,343
Yes, brother?

694
00:50:02,949 --> 00:50:04,610
They want justice.

695
00:50:05,018 --> 00:50:06,486
Then I will give them justice.

696
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:09,154
What you are doing is not right,
headman.

697
00:50:09,389 --> 00:50:10,356
Shut up!

698
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:21,166
Go away from here. Get lost.

699
00:50:25,639 --> 00:50:28,631
- Go away, I say.
- Back off!

700
00:50:29,376 --> 00:50:29,963
Back off! Father!

701
00:50:30,043 --> 00:50:34,207
Back off! Father!

702
00:50:34,981 --> 00:50:38,110
- Come on!
- Back off! Go inside!

703
00:50:38,351 --> 00:50:40,046
Let him go!

704
00:50:41,254 --> 00:50:42,085
Back off!

705
00:50:44,224 --> 00:50:44,778
Let him go! Let my father go!

706
00:50:44,858 --> 00:50:47,293
Let him go! Let my father go!

707
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:50,192
Back off, you scoundrels!

708
00:50:52,432 --> 00:50:58,030
Father! Let go of my father!

709
00:50:58,405 --> 00:50:59,192
Let him go!

710
00:50:59,272 --> 00:51:02,139
Let him go!

711
00:51:07,247 --> 00:51:11,411
- Let him go! Stop it!
- Push!

712
00:51:15,222 --> 00:51:17,486
Mother! Come with me.

713
00:51:18,458 --> 00:51:20,153
You cannot escape us.

714
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:21,591
Mother!

715
00:51:22,262 --> 00:51:23,388
Go inside.

716
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:27,232
Open the door!

717
00:51:35,275 --> 00:51:37,039
Open the door!

718
00:51:38,011 --> 00:51:39,536
Open the door!

719
00:51:40,547 --> 00:51:41,446
Break the door!

720
00:51:45,285 --> 00:51:50,155
Father! Let him go!

721
00:51:50,257 --> 00:51:51,691
Don't hit him!

722
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:55,560
Father!

723
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:58,051
Come back, Needhi!

724
00:51:58,131 --> 00:51:58,597
Come back, Needhi!

725
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:00,561
Close the door! Let's go.

726
00:52:00,667 --> 00:52:04,433
- Mother!
- Hurry up. Close it.

727
00:52:09,309 --> 00:52:12,335
Let go!

728
00:52:24,324 --> 00:52:26,486
Please forgive us.

729
00:52:30,263 --> 00:52:32,129
Let go!

730
00:52:32,532 --> 00:52:37,402
Please let us go.
Let her go!

731
00:52:45,178 --> 00:52:47,203
Mother!

732
00:52:48,348 --> 00:52:52,012
Mother! Mother!

733
00:52:52,219 --> 00:52:53,653
Mother!

734
00:52:54,187 --> 00:52:56,910
- Mother! No!
- Come on!

735
00:52:56,990 --> 00:52:59,459
- Mother! No!
- Come on!

736
00:52:59,659 --> 00:53:02,356
Mother! Mother!

737
00:53:02,996 --> 00:53:07,957
Mother! No!

738
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:10,502
No! Mother!

739
00:53:11,471 --> 00:53:11,725
No!

740
00:53:11,805 --> 00:53:13,273
No!

741
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:16,575
Father!

742
00:53:17,210 --> 00:53:20,145
Father! Let him go!

743
00:53:20,247 --> 00:53:23,410
- Let go of my daughter.
- Let him go!

744
00:53:23,516 --> 00:53:25,416
For God's sake let her go.

745
00:53:25,518 --> 00:53:26,139
- Let her go.
- Father!

746
00:53:26,219 --> 00:53:29,314
- Let her go.
- Father!

747
00:53:29,422 --> 00:53:32,221
- Let her go.
- Father!

748
00:53:32,525 --> 00:53:34,550
- Let my daughter go!
- Father!

749
00:53:35,528 --> 00:53:38,964
Lali, let him go!

750
00:53:39,065 --> 00:53:40,954
- Let him go, Lali!
- Hold her!

751
00:53:41,034 --> 00:53:42,092
- Let him go, Lali!
- Hold her!

752
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:47,373
Father! Father!

753
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:50,500
Father!

754
00:53:50,710 --> 00:53:54,237
Let me go! Let go!

755
00:53:57,017 --> 00:54:00,009
Let me go!

756
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:01,144
Father!

757
00:54:02,355 --> 00:54:08,453
Let me go!

758
00:54:09,429 --> 00:54:10,183
Let me go! No!

759
00:54:10,263 --> 00:54:13,255
Let me go! No!

760
00:54:14,267 --> 00:54:17,999
Let me go! Let go!

761
00:55:54,734 --> 00:55:57,704
So this means that the story
started at the land record keeper"  .

762
00:55:58,071 --> 00:55:59,596
And ended at Needhi's house.

763
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:03,086
Lali!

764
00:58:59,519 --> 00:59:00,384
Father!

765
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:01,988
Father. -

Someone help us!

Father!

783
00:59:29,582 --> 00:59:30,413
Father!

784
00:59:31,451 --> 00:59:32,885
Father. Get up.

785
00:59:33,186 --> 00:59:33,506
Father.

786
00:59:33,586 --> 00:59:34,018
Father.

787
00:59:34,153 --> 00:59:37,088
Father. look what they did to mother!

Mother.

Get up, mother!

792
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:48,321
Look mother, I am here.

793
00:59:48,401 --> 00:59:50,028
Look mother, I am here.

794
00:59:50,169 --> 00:59:51,068
Mother.

795
00:59:51,337 --> 00:59:52,463
Open your eyes, mother.

796
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:53,996
Look, I am here.

797
00:59:54,107 --> 00:59:55,404
I killed everyone and came back.

798
00:59:56,175 --> 00:59:59,304
Father is not getting up.

799
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:00,544
Mother.

800
01:00:01,114 --> 01:00:01,979
Mother.

801
01:00:03,349 --> 01:00:04,145
Mother. .?

802
01:00:05,952 --> 01:00:06,646
Mother.

803
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:08,677
Get up, mother.

804
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:13,015
Please get up.

805
01:00:16,529 --> 01:00:17,550
Don't leave me alone, mother.

806
01:00:17,630 --> 01:00:19,064
Don't leave me alone, mother.

807
01:00:21,034 --> 01:00:23,469
Don't leave me alone, mother.

808
01:00:27,407 --> 01:00:29,967
Mother!

809
01:00:31,678 --> 01:00:32,365
Mother!

810
01:00:32,445 --> 01:00:32,638
Mother!

811
01:00:37,684 --> 01:00:38,446
Mother!

812
01:00:40,019 --> 01:00:40,679
Mother!

813
01:00:47,026 --> 01:00:47,180
Mother!

814
01:00:47,260 --> 01:00:48,091
Mother!

815
01:01:01,274 --> 01:01:01,594
Father.

816
01:01:01,674 --> 01:01:02,106
Father.

817
01:01:03,009 --> 01:01:04,067
Father.

818
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:06,174
Don't leave me alone, father.

819
01:01:08,581 --> 01:01:11,175
Don't leave me alone, father.

820
01:01:13,353 --> 01:01:14,377
Mother!

821
01:01:17,523 --> 01:01:21,482
Don't leave me alone, father.

822
01:01:22,995 --> 01:01:24,360
Don't leave me alone, father.

823
01:01:25,698 --> 01:01:28,463
Look, I am back.

824
01:01:29,335 --> 01:01:31,224
Look father, I am back.

825
01:01:31,304 --> 01:01:32,169
Look father, I am back.

826
01:01:34,574 --> 01:01:38,374
Don't leave me alone, father.

827
01:01:39,278 --> 01:01:42,612
I cannot live alone, father.

828
01:01:43,249 --> 01:01:45,411
I cannot live alone, father.

829
01:01:46,686 --> 01:01:49,246
Don't leave me alone, father.

830
01:01:50,723 --> 01:01:53,124
Father!

831
01:02:28,728 --> 01:02:30,924
This is bad, Sukhdev.

832
01:02:32,231 --> 01:02:33,528
<i>Write down the report.</i>

833
01:02:34,634 --> 01:02:40,038
Mentally sick Needhi
killed her own parents.

834
01:02:42,375 --> 01:02:43,672
- Okay?
- Yes.

835
01:02:43,976 --> 01:02:45,569
Send these dead bodies
for post mortem.

836
01:02:53,586 --> 01:02:54,485
Hello.

837
01:03:00,326 --> 01:03:02,624
Don't worry, sir.
I have taken care of everything.

838
01:03:04,397 --> 01:03:06,593
Villagers,
you saw how crazy this girl is?

839
01:03:06,699 --> 01:03:08,997
She killed her own parents.

840
01:03:11,070 --> 01:03:13,038
She even killed her friend.

841
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:20,274
Headmaster, this craziness also
made her accuse my brother of rape.

842
01:03:20,980 --> 01:03:23,005
Villagers, beware of her.

843
01:03:23,449 --> 01:03:25,110
She can kill anyone.

844
01:03:25,418 --> 01:03:27,182
Listen to me very carefully.

845
01:03:27,453 --> 01:03:29,547
Don't make the mistake
of giving refuge to Needhi.

846
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:32,282
Needhi is a criminal now.

847
01:03:32,658 --> 01:03:35,025
Do you understand me?

848
01:03:40,032 --> 01:03:41,261
- Good job.
- Sir.

849
01:03:42,034 --> 01:03:43,524
- Let's go, kiddo.
- Let's go, brother.

850
01:03:45,104 --> 01:03:46,970
Everyone, go back home.

851
01:04:52,605 --> 01:04:55,575
Brother, everyone knows that
the girl is telling the truth.

852
01:04:56,008 --> 01:04:57,442
It is all headman's doings.

853
01:04:57,610 --> 01:04:59,078
But no one speaks
against him out of fear.

854
01:04:59,312 --> 01:05:01,007
Times are bad.

855
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:05,945
Only God knows who is telling
the truth and who is lying.

856
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:08,447
Sister, he had power
when he was a headman.

857
01:05:08,554 --> 01:05:10,109
And now he has become a minister.

858
01:05:10,189 --> 01:05:12,214
He says that Needhi is crazy.

859
01:05:12,425 --> 01:05:16,589
Needhi is suffering for
that damned Lali's deeds.

860
01:05:16,996 --> 01:05:21,331
Who knows, headman might be right.

861
01:05:21,567 --> 01:05:24,123
She must have killed her own parents.

862
01:05:24,203 --> 01:05:26,968
They had given her a lot of freedom.

863
01:05:33,512 --> 01:05:35,173
No, Bhaja. I am not hungry.

864
01:05:35,681 --> 01:05:37,308
What's wrong?

865
01:05:37,950 --> 01:05:39,179
You are great, brother.

866
01:05:39,552 --> 01:05:42,317
You are not doing anything
as if everything is over.

867
01:05:44,323 --> 01:05:46,018
That girl is still alive.

868
01:05:46,392 --> 01:05:48,121
So why are you worried?

869
01:05:48,394 --> 01:05:50,294
Do defeated pawns ever come back?

870
01:05:50,463 --> 01:05:51,487
Let her stay hidden.

871
01:05:51,597 --> 01:05:52,530
She will die of starvation.

872
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:55,964
If her hunger leads her to
the village then we will kill her.

873
01:05:56,302 --> 01:05:57,098
Eat.

874
01:05:57,403 --> 01:05:59,701
You should celebrate.
Don't worry.

875
01:06:02,108 --> 01:06:02,904
Keep it here.

876
01:06:04,410 --> 01:06:05,343
Where's the meat?

877
01:06:05,578 --> 01:06:06,374
Get it.

878
01:06:08,447 --> 01:06:09,471
Eat.

879
01:07:02,635 --> 01:07:03,363
Here.

880
01:07:18,117 --> 01:07:19,607
At least learn how to eat.

881
01:07:23,322 --> 01:07:24,517
Eat, my child.

882
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:28,317
You will grow stronger
only if you eat.

883
01:07:28,427 --> 01:07:30,418
Only then,
will you be able to clear your name.

884
01:07:31,997 --> 01:07:32,589
Here.

885
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:35,294
Eat.

886
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:44,569
Otherwise,
you would end up being like me.

887
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:51,147
I too faced a similar situation.

888
01:07:52,651 --> 01:07:54,676
If would have been
courageous back then..

889
01:07:55,387 --> 01:07:59,517
Then I wouldn't have been addressed
as the witch who killed her own son.

890
01:08:03,295 --> 01:08:04,285
Aunt.

891
01:08:07,266 --> 01:08:08,131
Aunt.

892
01:08:10,302 --> 01:08:11,133
Aunt.

893
01:08:14,173 --> 01:08:14,969
Aunt!

894
01:08:23,182 --> 01:08:26,948
I know you aren't one
of those who give up easily.

895
01:08:43,702 --> 01:08:45,670
"  From her eyes.."

896
01:08:49,208 --> 01:08:52,473
"  From her eyes.."

897
01:08:52,978 --> 01:08:56,346
"  From her eyes whiskey wells oven."

898
01:08:56,448 --> 01:08:58,610
"  From her eyes whiskey wells oven."

899
01:08:58,717 --> 01:09:01,880
"  Which police station
should I lodge a complaint in?"

900
01:09:01,987 --> 01:09:04,076
"  From her eyes whiskey wells oven."

901
01:09:04,156 --> 01:09:07,285
"  Which police station
should I lodge a complaint in?"

902
01:09:07,393 --> 01:09:10,954
"  All the bars in the
city have closed down."

903
01:09:11,063 --> 01:09:13,395
"  All the bars in the
city have closed down."

904
01:09:13,499 --> 01:09:16,366
"  From where do I get liquor bottles?"

905
01:09:16,468 --> 01:09:18,562
"  From her eyes whiskey wells oven."

906
01:09:18,671 --> 01:09:21,936
"  Which police station
should I lodge a complaint in?"

907
01:09:22,041 --> 01:09:24,066
"  From her eyes whiskey wells oven."

908
01:09:24,176 --> 01:09:27,237
"  Which police station
should I lodge a complaint in?"

909
01:09:27,346 --> 01:09:30,077
"  From her eyes whiskey wells oven."

910
01:09:47,032 --> 01:09:50,491
"  There are so many cases
going on so many people.

911
01:09:50,603 --> 01:09:53,573
"  That's why no one gets caught."

912
01:09:54,206 --> 01:09:57,471
"  Let me get drunk today,
don't stop me."

913
01:09:57,576 --> 01:10:00,132
"  Just look into my eyes."

914
01:10:00,212 --> 01:10:06,117
"  Let me drink through your eyes,
oh dear."

915
01:10:06,218 --> 01:10:09,141
"  I will stop drinking
from anyone else."

916
01:10:09,221 --> 01:10:11,519
"  From her eyes whiskey wells oven."

917
01:10:11,624 --> 01:10:14,559
"  Which police station
should I lodge a complaint in?"

918
01:10:14,660 --> 01:10:17,061
"  From her eyes whiskey wells oven."

919
01:10:17,162 --> 01:10:20,132
"  Which police station
should I lodge a complaint in?"

920
01:10:20,232 --> 01:10:24,396
"  From her eyes whiskey wells oven."

921
01:12:11,477 --> 01:12:13,502
Villagers, that girl has gone crazy.

922
01:12:15,447 --> 01:12:17,176
She can kill anyone.

923
01:12:19,718 --> 01:12:21,117
Beware of her.

924
01:12:50,015 --> 01:12:50,982
Headman..

925
01:12:52,584 --> 01:12:53,710
- Brother Lali..
- Enough!

926
01:12:58,257 --> 01:13:00,021
I know that Lali is dead.

927
01:13:03,195 --> 01:13:05,163
I also know who killed him.

928
01:13:06,198 --> 01:13:08,963
I want Needhi at any cost.

929
01:13:09,935 --> 01:13:12,165
Get this straight.

930
01:13:13,138 --> 01:13:17,234
If you don't get her
before I gather Lali's ashes"  .

931
01:13:17,342 --> 01:13:19,367
Then you too will meet this same fate.

932
01:13:19,578 --> 01:13:21,171
This is what I will do to you.

933
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:22,611
Go and do your job.

934
01:13:23,015 --> 01:13:23,504
Go!

935
01:13:38,230 --> 01:13:40,028
Sir, what are you doing?

936
01:13:40,232 --> 01:13:41,666
Roasting corn!

937
01:13:42,167 --> 01:13:43,430
Can't you see I am loading bullets?

938
01:13:44,002 --> 01:13:45,470
But you have never done that before.

939
01:13:45,971 --> 01:13:49,066
Such an incident has never taken
place in this village before either.

940
01:13:49,241 --> 01:13:50,970
Better safe than sorry.

941
01:13:51,243 --> 01:13:52,142
Go mind your own business.

942
01:13:52,244 --> 01:13:53,109
Okay, sir.

943
01:14:04,456 --> 01:14:06,481
Aunt, any news about Needhi?

944
01:14:06,592 --> 01:14:07,923
I don't know anything.

945
01:14:09,027 --> 01:14:11,116
- Me neither.
- No.

946
01:14:11,196 --> 01:14:12,061
Let's go.

947
01:14:12,164 --> 01:14:13,598
Have you seen her!

948
01:14:16,101 --> 01:14:17,535
What is police doing here?

949
01:14:22,174 --> 01:14:23,608
Come here.

950
01:14:26,478 --> 01:14:27,570
Yes, sir?

951
01:14:28,413 --> 01:14:29,903
You have any news about Needhi?

952
01:14:30,549 --> 01:14:32,108
- No, sir, I don't.
- You don't?

953
01:14:37,055 --> 01:14:37,544
Let's go.

954
01:14:53,705 --> 01:14:54,501
Yes, tell me.

955
01:14:54,673 --> 01:14:55,697
MLA sir.

956
01:14:56,308 --> 01:14:58,606
I think everyone in this
village is supporting Needhi.

957
01:14:59,244 --> 01:15:00,871
I will have to kill a few people.

958
01:15:01,113 --> 01:15:03,411
I don't care whether
you kill one or twenty.

959
01:15:04,683 --> 01:15:06,617
I want Needhi.

960
01:15:07,452 --> 01:15:09,284
Dead or alive.

961
01:15:09,688 --> 01:15:10,621
Yes, sir.

962
01:15:13,325 --> 01:15:18,559
My dear, crime always pays.

963
01:15:18,664 --> 01:15:20,428
I have heard that a number of times.

964
01:15:21,066 --> 01:15:23,660
But today, I saw it.

965
01:15:25,170 --> 01:15:27,605
May God give you a long life, dear.

966
01:15:28,473 --> 01:15:30,908
By seeking revenge
for Shanno's death"  .

967
01:15:31,643 --> 01:15:34,613
You have saved me from mortiﬁcation.

968
01:15:35,447 --> 01:15:37,541
You have saved me
from mortification, dear.

969
01:15:38,050 --> 01:15:41,111
May God give you a long life, dear.

970
01:15:43,989 --> 01:15:47,425
I don't want a long life.
I want justice.

971
01:16:18,457 --> 01:16:20,050
I must say"  .

972
01:16:22,094 --> 01:16:24,153
You are indeed quite courageous.

973
01:16:25,097 --> 01:16:28,965
Good you came here on your own.

974
01:16:29,701 --> 01:16:31,328
Balwant!

975
01:16:33,105 --> 01:16:34,368
Balwant!

976
01:16:35,707 --> 01:16:37,106
Where is everyone!

977
01:16:39,044 --> 01:16:40,307
No one is going to come.

978
01:16:42,648 --> 01:16:44,616
Nor is anyone going to hear you.

979
01:16:45,484 --> 01:16:46,542
Really?

980
01:16:46,718 --> 01:16:49,585
Because not all inspectors
here are like you.

981
01:16:51,390 --> 01:16:53,688
There are some human beings
like constable Balwant Singh as well.

982
01:17:02,234 --> 01:17:03,201
You will shoot me!

983
01:17:04,169 --> 01:17:04,931
Go ahead.

984
01:17:17,349 --> 01:17:19,647
I will use my hands to kill you.

985
01:17:52,050 --> 01:17:54,382
You love to write reports, don't you?

986
01:17:57,723 --> 01:17:58,690
Write this report.

987
01:18:00,292 --> 01:18:01,555
No, Needhi.

988
01:18:04,529 --> 01:18:07,328
It was the Durjan's trick.

989
01:18:09,267 --> 01:18:10,928
It is not my fault.

990
01:18:12,404 --> 01:18:15,101
I was helpless.

991
01:18:15,607 --> 01:18:16,403
Needhi!

992
01:18:17,976 --> 01:18:18,636
Please.

993
01:18:22,180 --> 01:18:23,614
Please spare my life.

994
01:18:25,417 --> 01:18:26,578
Please Needhi.

995
01:19:15,333 --> 01:19:16,892
Needhi!

996
01:19:20,338 --> 01:19:21,965
It was not my fault.

997
01:19:23,608 --> 01:19:26,202
I was helpless.

998
01:19:26,411 --> 01:19:28,402
But ﬁre is never helpless.

999
01:19:31,183 --> 01:19:32,241
No..

1000
01:19:34,586 --> 01:19:35,985
No..

1001
01:19:37,689 --> 01:19:40,920
No Needhi..

1002
01:20:17,028 --> 01:20:21,158
"  Why did you hurt me?"

1003
01:20:21,433 --> 01:20:25,563
"  Why did you do this, oh God?"

1004
01:20:25,670 --> 01:20:29,971
"  Why did you snatch
away all the happiness?"

1005
01:20:30,075 --> 01:20:33,636
"  Why did you break me like this,
oh God?"

1006
01:20:34,379 --> 01:20:38,441
"  Why did you hurt me?"

1007
01:20:38,750 --> 01:20:42,983
"  Why did you do this, oh God?"

1008
01:20:43,188 --> 01:20:47,386
"  Why did you snatch
away all the happiness?"

1009
01:20:47,592 --> 01:20:51,187
"  Why did you break me like this,
oh God?"

1010
01:20:52,030 --> 01:20:56,024
"  Why did you break me like this,
oh God?"

1011
01:21:04,943 --> 01:21:09,141
"  Now my life is ﬁlled with sorrow."

1012
01:21:09,347 --> 01:21:13,147
"  I have befriended pain."

1013
01:21:13,585 --> 01:21:18,045
"  Now my life is ﬁlled with tears."

1014
01:21:18,156 --> 01:21:22,286
"  Happiness has ﬂown out of my life."

1015
01:21:22,394 --> 01:21:26,160
"  Why did you let them ﬂy away?"

1016
01:21:26,298 --> 01:21:31,031
"  Why didn't you let them stay,
oh God?"

1017
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:35,403
"  Why did you hurt me?"

1018
01:21:35,507 --> 01:21:39,171
"  Why did you do this, oh God?"

1019
01:21:39,744 --> 01:21:44,204
"  Why did you snatch
away all the happiness?"

1020
01:21:44,382 --> 01:21:48,114
"  Why did you break me like this,
oh God?"

1021
01:22:14,646 --> 01:22:23,316
"  Why did you ruin my life, Oh God?"

1022
01:22:23,488 --> 01:22:32,090
"  Why did you snatch
away all the happy moments?"

1023
01:22:32,197 --> 01:22:36,430
"  Why did you let fate defeat me?"

1024
01:22:36,601 --> 01:22:40,435
"  Why did you make me stray, Oh God?"

1025
01:22:40,739 --> 01:22:45,108
"  Why did you hurt me?"

1026
01:22:45,310 --> 01:22:49,440
"  Why did you do this, oh God?"

1027
01:22:49,614 --> 01:22:53,710
"  Why did you snatch
away all the happiness?"

1028
01:22:54,019 --> 01:22:58,047
"  Why did you break me like this,
oh God?"

1029
01:22:58,423 --> 01:23:02,519
"  I am the fragrance
lingering in the Wind"

1030
01:23:02,694 --> 01:23:06,494
"  I ﬂow freewheelingly."

1031
01:23:06,998 --> 01:23:11,026
"  I only listen to my heart."

1032
01:23:11,269 --> 01:23:15,433
"  I make my own path."

1033
01:23:15,607 --> 01:23:19,669
"  I am the fragrance
lingering in the Wind"

1034
01:23:20,045 --> 01:23:23,982
"  I ﬂow freewheelingly."

1035
01:23:24,416 --> 01:23:28,512
"  I only listen to my heart."

1036
01:23:29,154 --> 01:23:32,988
"  I make my own path."

1037
01:23:33,224 --> 01:23:38,958
"  I make my own path."

1038
01:23:50,241 --> 01:23:53,176
Then you must also
know where Needhi is.

1039
01:23:54,646 --> 01:23:55,704
Sir, but.

1040
01:23:58,983 --> 01:24:00,610
I want to meet Needhi.

1041
01:24:01,519 --> 01:24:03,487
Sir, I can make you meet her but.

1042
01:24:03,988 --> 01:24:07,288
I'll request you to not meet
her as a police officer.

1043
01:24:46,664 --> 01:24:48,428
Get this straight.

1044
01:24:48,733 --> 01:24:51,532
Durjan Singh isn't scared
of that worthless girl.

1045
01:25:05,183 --> 01:25:06,412
Get lost!

1046
01:25:41,219 --> 01:25:42,687
Needhi, my child"  .

1047
01:25:56,467 --> 01:26:00,199
Did the last one miss something
which he wishes to complete?

1048
01:26:00,605 --> 01:26:03,370
Look, I sympathize with you.

1049
01:26:04,142 --> 01:26:06,543
I know what happened with you.

1050
01:26:07,579 --> 01:26:11,015
But what you did is
a crime as per the law.

1051
01:26:11,249 --> 01:26:15,482
If you want,
I can help you get justice.

1052
01:26:17,155 --> 01:26:18,054
Justice?

1053
01:26:18,690 --> 01:26:21,159
Justice is now just a joke, inspector.

1054
01:26:22,527 --> 01:26:25,360
Now, I will get justice
only after I kill the headman.

1055
01:26:26,164 --> 01:26:28,656
Tell me, will you help me?

1056
01:26:31,035 --> 01:26:32,594
I cannot do that even if I want to.

1057
01:26:34,105 --> 01:26:37,405
Because I don't let my
emotions overpower my duty.

1058
01:26:37,709 --> 01:26:40,542
And my emotions have become my duty,
inspector.

1059
01:26:41,512 --> 01:26:47,042
Look Needhi, if you surrender,
I will help you reduce the term.

1060
01:26:47,685 --> 01:26:50,916
You too know that what you have done..

1061
01:26:51,322 --> 01:26:53,689
The punishment for that is death.

1062
01:26:56,027 --> 01:26:57,654
Death never scares the dead.

1063
01:27:00,298 --> 01:27:06,067
I died the day I held
my parents dead bodies.

1064
01:27:11,342 --> 01:27:12,639
I can understand your pain.

1065
01:27:14,646 --> 01:27:18,241
That's why today I have
come to you as a well-wisher.

1066
01:27:18,683 --> 01:27:23,052
But tomorrow, an inspector
will come to meet a criminal.

1067
01:27:25,056 --> 01:27:25,989
Wait.

1068
01:27:35,566 --> 01:27:37,967
Tell me, what is this?

1069
01:27:40,672 --> 01:27:41,503
Nine.

1070
01:27:42,006 --> 01:27:44,976
If you see it from where
I am standing, it is six.

1071
01:27:48,579 --> 01:27:51,071
Inspector,
it is just a different point of view.

1072
01:27:51,349 --> 01:27:55,684
You are right in your
place and I am right in mine.

1073
01:27:56,688 --> 01:27:57,587
Let's go.

1074
01:28:21,679 --> 01:28:26,480
What does she think
that she will defeat me..

1075
01:28:26,651 --> 01:28:28,085
..by killing my rook and my queen?

1076
01:28:28,286 --> 01:28:29,219
No!

1077
01:28:31,556 --> 01:28:33,923
I will make the last move.

1078
01:28:35,393 --> 01:28:37,418
Because the king still lives.

1079
01:28:37,929 --> 01:28:39,954
I will make the last move.

1080
01:29:46,197 --> 01:29:52,102
Oh Lord Almighty,
you have always been with me.

1081
01:29:53,604 --> 01:29:57,063
You have always blessed
me with your support.

1082
01:29:58,009 --> 01:30:01,377
Oh Lord Almighty,
just give me enough strength"  .

1083
01:30:03,047 --> 01:30:07,314
That I don't step
back while facing them.

1084
01:30:07,618 --> 01:30:09,643
Whether or not I die today.

1085
01:30:11,989 --> 01:30:15,948
I want to die only
after the headman is dead.

1086
01:31:07,378 --> 01:31:09,403
Sir, we found Needhi!

1087
01:31:48,085 --> 01:31:51,055
We won't let her escape today!
Let's go!

1088
01:31:51,155 --> 01:31:53,144
We will kill her today! Let's go!

1089
01:31:53,224 --> 01:31:55,090
She won't be spared today!

- Kill her!

You cannot escape us today!

1092
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:05,995
- Today you will meet your end!
- No one will be able to save you!

1093
01:32:10,141 --> 01:32:11,370
Sir, the case is still in the court.

1094
01:32:11,475 --> 01:32:13,000
Sir, there has been
a clash in the village.

1095
01:32:13,110 --> 01:32:14,339
Some of our men are also involved.

1096
01:34:03,187 --> 01:34:06,122
Find her! She cannot escape.

1097
01:34:06,624 --> 01:34:08,353
Find her quickly.

1098
01:34:13,264 --> 01:34:17,258
- She must be hiding here somewhere. Come on, follow me.
- Check there.

1099
01:34:22,406 --> 01:34:24,528
- Catch there!
- Come this way!

1100
01:34:24,608 --> 01:34:26,269
This way! Come on.

1101
01:34:27,511 --> 01:34:28,672
You go there.

1102
01:38:09,567 --> 01:38:10,932
What happened!

1103
01:38:11,402 --> 01:38:12,335
That's Needhi!

1104
01:38:12,436 --> 01:38:14,632
God's been cruel,
ﬁrst her parents now her..

1105
01:38:16,440 --> 01:38:23,176
Villagers, this is the Needhi
Singh who killed her parents.

1106
01:38:24,248 --> 01:38:27,183
This is the Needhi Singh who has
terrorized villagers and police alike.

1107
01:38:27,484 --> 01:38:28,576
A girl..

1108
01:38:29,019 --> 01:38:32,284
A girl had turned our
heaven like village into hell.

1109
01:38:33,157 --> 01:38:34,522
Look at fate.

1110
01:38:35,192 --> 01:38:36,216
Here she lies.

1111
01:38:37,361 --> 01:38:38,419
She is the same Needhi Singh.

1112
01:38:38,529 --> 01:38:40,327
"  who used to laugh and
play around in the village.

1113
01:38:42,566 --> 01:38:47,128
As they say,
slippers are meant to be on the feet.

1114
01:38:48,539 --> 01:38:51,406
I fulﬁlled by duty as an MLA.

1115
01:38:52,009 --> 01:38:54,103
Now whether you like it or not.

1116
01:38:54,612 --> 01:38:56,444
This is what her destiny
had stored for her.

1117
01:38:57,281 --> 01:38:59,340
She wanted to hunt me.

1118
01:39:00,017 --> 01:39:01,041
She ended up being hunted.

1119
01:39:26,677 --> 01:39:33,583
Khalsa belongs to Lord!
Victory belongs to Lord!

1120
01:39:53,537 --> 01:39:54,265
Let's go.

1121
01:40:04,948 --> 01:40:06,416
Sir, What should
I Write in the report?

1122
01:40:07,551 --> 01:40:09,451
What report will we write, Balwant?

1123
01:40:10,187 --> 01:40:12,155
She has written history today.
