1
00:02:32,118 --> 00:02:34,962
Just tell him as I told you.

2
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:36,832
Turn the vehicle near Kay Raj.

3
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:06,161
What's this Kay Raj?

4
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:07,896
Do you know the consequences
if Oil Raj comes to know it?

5
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:11,364
Tell Oil Raj, I don't want the
pittance he offers

6
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:15,165
I'm also contesting elections
my press is also running losses.

7
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:18,103
I'm taking over oil business.

8
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:20,676
Tell him, I think he won't do
anything as revenge

9
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,972
Even if he does,
it won't have any effect on me

10
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:28,084
My friend shouting on me

11
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:31,516
My cat meowing at me.

12
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:34,085
Kay Raj is going overboard.

13
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,454
He's abusing we police publicly.

14
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:40,096
He has taken over oil business too.

15
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,931
He's contesting elections,
if by chance he wins..

16
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:47,002
What's your future plan, Oil Raj?

17
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:49,730
I made 2 or 3 attempts, but he got saved.

18
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:53,843
Local Bangalore goons can't
go anywhere near him.

19
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:56,445
That's okay, what's your next plan?

20
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:24,073
What's the matter, Raj?

21
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:27,636
This is Kay Raj's house in VWIson Garden.

22
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:29,814
He leaves home at 6.30 am early morning,

23
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:33,746
viaAshoka pillar he goes to Jayanagar
Police Station to sign register,

24
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,613
He returns home using the same route.

25
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:36,513
Then...

26
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:04,562
Kranthiveera
Weekly Magazine - Bangalore

27
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,075
Okay, send it.

28
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,175
Please come in.

29
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:15,069
Do you know him?

30
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:18,738
She's Sasi, who is writing
an article about goon Om

31
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,281
Please sit down.
- Greetings.

32
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:21,243
Please sit down.

33
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,856
I've written this week about
underworld Don Kay Raj.

34
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:28,525
Please check it once, sir.

35
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:33,763
Look, when you write about goons,

36
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,728
instead of why they chose life of violence?

37
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:38,061
What's their wish or aim?
Forget all that

38
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:41,500
How do they kill people?
Write how they go about doing it.

39
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:43,901
People would be thrilled to read it.

40
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:49,106
Which goon are you meeting next week?

41
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,747
You, sir!

42
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:57,012
I interviewed many goons but missed
to interview the biggest goon in our office.

43
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,780
What are you saying?

44
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,754
They kill for money or for any other purpose

45
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:03,760
Worse than those goons,

46
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:10,231
aren't you the worse goon who uses
goons to improve your circulation, sir?

47
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:18,241
I'm not interviewing goons
to increase our circulation only,

48
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:21,742
we do have social responsibility
as press persons

49
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:24,346
why do young men take
to life of violence?

50
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:25,743
What's their future?

51
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:29,408
How society looks at them?
That is my aim, sir.

52
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:33,850
I was just testing you.

53
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:38,791
If my aim was only circulation,
I would've started a sex magazine

54
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:40,555
Well said, sir.

55
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:50,407
You wanted to meet Tanveer, Krishnappa,
'Bekkinkannu' Rajendra today, right?

56
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:52,405
You meet them.

57
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,818
What do you want, madam?

58
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:09,391
We're coming from Kranthiveera magazine
I want to meet Tanveer.

59
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:11,357
You want to meet Tanveer?
Why?

60
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,394
To interview him.

61
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:24,733
Some journalist is here to interview you.

62
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:26,774
Shut up! may;

63
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:29,071
I want your interview.
- No interview, go away.

64
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:32,272
Switch it off...switch it off...

65
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:39,180
He's here to film a goon.
- Not like than, bhai.

66
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:43,024
One second madam...

67
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:47,224
Tanveer is not in good mood today,
come another day to meet him

68
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:51,398
This is my card, call when he's fine.
- Okay, madam.

69
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:52,994
Do you know to speak Kannada?

70
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:55,297
We were born in Karnamaka,
how can we not speak in Kannada?

71
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:58,737
We learnt Kannada is school,
we do speak in Kannada only.

72
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:04,541
Read this and tell the story to Tanveer.

73
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,248
Is it novel?
-You read it once Youill know it.

74
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,111
Okay.

75
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,255
I told you not to meet the goons
you didn't listen to me.

76
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:18,725
If Right hand wasn't there,
Tanveer would've killed us

77
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:21,728
If you interview goons
you've to face such problems.

78
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:23,400
Why are you so scared?

79
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:27,503
Where have we come now?
- Come, I'll tell you.

80
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,831
Did you see SI?
-I met him.

81
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:46,288
Okay, I'll see to it.

82
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,015
Greeting; sir.
- Greetings.

83
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:49,591
Greeting; sir.

84
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:51,086
Please come and sit.

85
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,091
Please sit here

86
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:59,194
Are you the journalist writing about goons
in Kranthiveera magazine?

87
00:10:59,392 --> 00:10:59,995
Yes

88
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:01,603
Ask me, what do you want to know?

89
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:03,467
I want to interview you.
- Go ahead

90
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,074
He's 'Kurangu' Krishna
- Greetings.

91
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:07,437
Can I put few questions to you also?

92
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:08,737
Go ahead, no problem

93
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:11,437
Why did you choose this life of violence?

94
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:27,323
At 13 into the life of violence,
jail term killings!

95
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,464
Clashes!

96
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:32,227
When you look what do you think of your life?

97
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:34,063
I feel like throwing up!

98
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,901
I'm unable to anything about myself.

99
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:41,341
Why don't you try to give up
this life of violence?

100
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:45,911
If you want to turn a new leaf in life,
in our magazine"

101
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:48,676
Put headlines of Jedahalli Krishnappa
has become good man!

102
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,046
Would this society accept it?

103
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:51,084
They'll not believe it.

104
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:56,584
If we do give up violence,
we'll become toothless snakes

105
00:11:56,782 --> 00:11:58,659
Even little kids would start dominating us.

106
00:11:58,851 --> 00:11:59,955
It'll not happen, forget it.

107
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:01,324
Please give that book.

108
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:07,167
Take it...you too take it.

109
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:10,399
What is this?

110
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:13,736
A book I wrote about a goon.
Please read it once.

111
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:17,642
Are you trying to change a demon
with kid's bedtime story book?

112
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:22,181
Please read it once!
Shall we go?

113
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:34,724
Take it, Sasi.
I've written my full life story.

114
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,730
Can I trust whatever
you've written is true?

115
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:40,927
You've to trust,
how do you know about my life story?

116
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:44,006
If you don't trust me, I'll tear it.

117
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:45,266
No, nothing like that.

118
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:47,410
Please don't get angry.

119
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,241
Come...come...
- Leave me...leave me"

120
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,505
Wait a minute.

121
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:53,911
He's that girl's elder brother:

122
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:57,376
I told you not to go after the lovers,
why did you go?

123
00:12:57,576 --> 00:12:58,953
Don't you want to protect your limbs?

124
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:00,556
Please take care of him, boys.

125
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:06,892
Leave him, boys!

126
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:11,498
Don't go after those lovers,
if you do, I'll cut your limbs.

127
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:14,899
Do you know who am I?
Do you know my name?

128
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:16,095
I'm Rajendra

129
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,612
Wham would you like to have, madam?
Coffee or tea?

130
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,941
Don't you've any mercy?

131
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:28,346
Why did you hit him mercilessly?
- You didn't ask what did he do?

132
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,748
Wham did he do?
- One of my boys loved a girl.

133
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:32,286
She too loved him

134
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:36,016
He's against the girl loving him
That's why I hit him as warning.

135
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:38,991
I can't tolerate anyone
who is against lovers.

136
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:43,600
Is there place for love and affection
in your hardened heart?

137
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:45,097
Why do you ask like than, madam?

138
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:46,565
Are goons heart less people?

139
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:48,329
'Ne too have hearts, madam

140
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:50,973
If you want I'll tell you an example.

141
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,437
There's a famous goon in Chamarajpet,

142
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:54,907
he loved a girl,
that girl's name is Madhuri,

143
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,172
meet her, you'll know about
the heart of a goon

144
00:13:58,771 --> 00:13:59,647
Madhuri?

145
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:06,317
Ball has gone into Madhuri madam's house.

146
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:08,255
Who will bring it?

147
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:12,726
Go, nothing will happen.
- No way.

148
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:16,262
Where's Madhuri's house?
- That one, madam.

149
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:20,733
Madam, you'll find a ball there,
please get it for us.

150
00:14:20,926 --> 00:14:22,200
Why? Can't you get it yourself?

151
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:25,341
No boy can enter the place, sir.
- Why?

152
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:50,764
Come, let's see!

153
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:05,105
Wham happened? Who are those guys?

154
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:06,806
That girl's goons!

155
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:09,509
No young man can walk freely
in this street because of her.

156
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:12,621
Who is she?
- Who else? Madhuri in that house

157
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:16,420
What did she do?

158
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:18,094
What will she do? My foot!

159
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:21,561
The goon who is after her is doing all this.

160
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:25,964
Last night buses were off the road,
so the girl asked him to drop at home.

161
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:30,004
Since she lived in the opposite house,
he dropped her at home

162
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:31,799
Look, how the goons thrashed him.

163
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:34,136
Did they thrash him for
dropping her at home?

164
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,677
Drop? They'll thrash even
if you talk to her.

165
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:39,042
We too have fallen in love and
seen many lovers also.

166
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:42,310
But never seen anyone love like this.

167
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:47,088
Where can I find Madhuri now?

168
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:09,743
What's this?
What's wrong with you?

169
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:21,453
Did the goons came back to trouble you?

170
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,421
That's her college...come...

171
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:29,332
I'm not coming to meet her, you carry on.

172
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:34,428
It seems goons will follow her,
if they come, I'll send you message

173
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,406
A girl Madhuri...

174
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:49,318
The girl going in midi is Madhuri.

175
00:16:57,082 --> 00:16:58,220
Look at her figure!

176
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:01,489
What a figure! Looks great!

177
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:09,564
What a girl...fantastic!

178
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:29,691
Greetings sister!

179
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:34,729
Brother doesn't like you going
out in midi, sister.

180
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:38,064
Look sister, how those wastrels
were ogling at you.

181
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:41,500
Brother told you to wear only saris

182
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:45,205
I'll wear any dresses I like
Who the hell is he to stop me!

183
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:48,469
Sister, slap me also!

184
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:51,409
But please don't embarrass brother
wearing such dresses

185
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:52,741
He loves you so much

186
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:55,248
Love? I'll prefer death than love him

187
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:59,890
Tell that mad man, if it hurts him,
I'll wear such dresses only.

188
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:06,128
My name is Sasi.

189
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:07,922
Why these goons are after you?

190
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,929
How are you connected to this?

191
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:11,526
No...

192
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:21,301
All her clothes are getting burnt!

193
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:46,897
Madhuri, that goon sent saris and
burnt all your other clothes

194
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:03,912
Father, Kumar is coming from Bombay.

195
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:05,916
Really?
- Yes, look at this

196
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:09,425
Brother-in-law is coming...
he'll get you aero plane"

197
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:10,423
Shut up!

198
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:17,222
This time I must find an auspicious time
and fix your marriage.

199
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:19,231
My responsibility will be over.

200
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:23,431
But this goon is troubling me a lot!

201
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,767
You don't worry, father.

202
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:29,070
Let Kumar come here,
that goon will meet his end.

203
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:34,076
Sister, bus has arrived.

204
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:36,519
This is the bus from Bombay.

205
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:50,561
Are you fine, brother?
- I'm fine.

206
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:52,167
Did you've a safe journey?

207
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:55,731
Bus journey showed us
how good this place is!

208
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:02,002
Is it my birthday today?

209
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:05,175
Today is April 24, right?

210
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,243
A small gift from your fiancE.

211
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,753
They've been troubling me every day, Kumar.

212
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:17,791
Teach them a lesson.

213
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:19,485
Who are you guys?

214
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:27,497
Do you know what this is?

215
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:44,184
You look good!

216
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:46,754
We don't want you to become like that doll.

217
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:49,183
Forget her and go back to Bombay.

218
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,728
You stay here is not good.

219
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:53,888
Go back to Bombay.

220
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,627
You can stay here.

221
00:20:57,723 --> 00:21:00,397
Get in..get in..get in quickly...

222
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,833
Don't stop anywhere till Bombay...

223
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:07,976
Sister, brother wants to meet you,
please come with us.

224
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:12,176
If you refuse to come,
your younger brother will become like this

225
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:17,416
Why are you thinking, sister?
Please come, sister.

226
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,247
We're there with you, don't worry.
Car is ready.

227
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:20,184
Come, sister.

228
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:21,357
What's this atrocity, brother-in-law?

229
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,416
Let's go to police.

230
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:00,229
Come sister...come...

231
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:04,627
Come in, sister.

232
00:22:05,857 --> 00:22:06,494
Please come in.

233
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:11,634
Come

234
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:16,173
Brother, this is the gift given
by uncle's son for sister's birthday

235
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,642
Samhya alias Sathyamunhy

236
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:36,550
Take it.

237
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:38,587
Wear it.

238
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:44,834
Madhuri, don't make me angry.

239
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:48,428
You know very well
what would I do if I get angry!

240
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:49,832
Take it.

241
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:51,498
Wear it.

242
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:50,159
Do you know how beautiful
you're in this sari!

243
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:55,100
Golden doll...
you look like golden doll!

244
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:08,341
I told you that I hate you,
why are you still after me?

245
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,520
I'll not love you
even if my life is in danger.

246
00:25:12,777 --> 00:25:16,088
Why?...why?...
Why will you not love me?

247
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:17,055
What do I lack?

248
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:19,229
Look! Am I blind?
Am I old man?

249
00:25:19,417 --> 00:25:22,261
Look at me!
Look! Wham do I lack?

250
00:25:23,388 --> 00:25:26,835
Whether you love or not,
I will love you

251
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:29,665
Your eyes...you cheeks...
are very beautiful...

252
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:31,238
I want them.

253
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:33,272
I love every inch of your body.

254
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:35,001
Who the hell are you to stop me?

255
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:38,348
You don't have any right
to say I mustn't love you.

256
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:42,576
Not just you no one in this world has
any right to stop any man from loving a girl.

257
00:25:42,774 --> 00:25:46,153
Look, if a boy insists the girl
he loves must love hm

258
00:25:46,344 --> 00:25:47,414
That is selfish love.

259
00:25:47,612 --> 00:25:51,253
But l...l...whether you love me or not,
I love you.

260
00:25:51,449 --> 00:25:52,985
This is selfless love!

261
00:25:53,184 --> 00:25:56,563
Tell me...who loves anyone like this?

262
00:25:56,755 --> 00:25:59,565
Who loves anyone like this?
Tell me! Tell me!

263
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,864
Come...come...

264
00:26:09,534 --> 00:26:12,447
I offered prayers in temple for you.

265
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:13,215
Take it.

266
00:26:13,672 --> 00:26:14,844
Take the offering
- No.

267
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,781
Take it.
- No.

268
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,262
You know how beautiful you are!

269
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,832
Please for God's sake, leave me

270
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:40,175
What happiness will you get
by marrying me forcibly?

271
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:42,739
I can't accept your love

272
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,542
I can't!

273
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:50,419
Today is your birthday, Madhu.

274
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:53,586
I can't bear to see you in tears this day.

275
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:58,488
Look, I've specially ordered this for you

276
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:11,500
Why do you...

277
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:20,441
Blow the candle and cut the cake

278
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:21,982
No.
- Take it.

279
00:27:24,876 --> 00:27:25,411
Cut it.

280
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:30,715
Cut the cake, Madhu.

281
00:28:01,212 --> 00:28:04,625
How happily you used to celebrate
Holi festival every year!

282
00:28:05,283 --> 00:28:07,524
You used to put colours on
every resident in this street.

283
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:10,560
This year your life has become colourless.

284
00:28:10,755 --> 00:28:12,166
This year too it will be colourful, uncle.

285
00:28:17,295 --> 00:28:19,536
I'm here to put colour on my Madhu.

286
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:22,940
Please don't do it.
- Why? Why, uncle?

287
00:28:23,134 --> 00:28:26,411
Shouldn't I do it?
Come, Madhu.

288
00:28:26,604 --> 00:28:27,981
Let's play with colours outside

289
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:30,986
Come

290
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:34,357
If we play inside, house will get dirty.

291
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:35,923
Listen to me, please come out.

292
00:28:38,783 --> 00:28:39,853
Leave my hand.

293
00:28:40,251 --> 00:28:42,891
Father...
- Sathya, leave her...

294
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:45,159
Father, look at him...

295
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:00,182
Please don't...

296
00:30:07,205 --> 00:30:10,914
Father, let's go.
- Where?

297
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:12,247
To police station!

298
00:30:12,443 --> 00:30:14,753
No, he will...

299
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:16,789
Let him do anything he can

300
00:30:39,437 --> 00:30:40,745
Get down!

301
00:30:41,372 --> 00:30:45,514
Let's stay put here, father!
Let him do anything he wants!

302
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:54,849
You thought of going to police,

303
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:58,486
I got you both down from car
and burnt empty car.

304
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:02,427
If you go to police,

305
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:06,967
I'll get you alone from house and
burn down your house with family.

306
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:08,836
Be careful!

307
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,000
Come, boys!

308
00:32:21,172 --> 00:32:23,448
Madam! Where are the residents of this house?

309
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:24,415
I don't know.

310
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:28,318
They vacated the place overnight
unable to bear the torture of that goon.

311
00:32:31,482 --> 00:32:32,552
Vacated the house?

312
00:33:00,611 --> 00:33:04,718
I've cleaned the wardrobe,
keep your things there, father.

313
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:05,621
Okay.

314
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:14,394
You don't worry, everything will be fine.

315
00:33:14,592 --> 00:33:17,471
Let's ask Kumar to come here
in near future,

316
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,437
and get you both engaged secretly. Okay?

317
00:33:21,466 --> 00:33:25,278
Inform Kumar and tell him
to come here as soon as possible

318
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:26,744
We'll conduct their marriage.

319
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:30,147
What are you saying?
That goon is no ordinary guy.

320
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:33,015
If anything goes wrong...
- How can you talk like this?

321
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:36,090
Other than us who else is there
to take care of her?

322
00:33:36,547 --> 00:33:37,821
Okay, as you wish.

323
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:42,496
Samhya, calm down
- How can I be calm?

324
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,667
Don't you know how much I love her!

325
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,733
We know how much you love her, Samhya

326
00:33:46,924 --> 00:33:50,167
I'll get my boys to find her.
- How could she go away?

327
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:51,465
So many have passed since she left home.

328
00:33:51,662 --> 00:33:53,903
Where did she go away?
What happened to her?

329
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:59,572
No...no...Sathya...

330
00:34:10,581 --> 00:34:18,932
Second daughter of Bangalore
Guttahalli Narasimha, Miss Madhuri,

331
00:34:19,123 --> 00:34:24,123
marriage is fixed with Kumar,
son of Ramaraju of Bombay on 25.5.95.

332
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:36,844
At Guru Raja marriage hall.

333
00:34:37,608 --> 00:34:38,916
Put engage ring to her.

334
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:16,888
Leave me!

335
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:28,797
This is the last warning for you.

336
00:35:28,993 --> 00:35:31,337
If you try to go away from me

337
00:35:31,762 --> 00:35:33,537
I'll rip you apart!

338
00:35:34,098 --> 00:35:36,635
Others will marry only
if you're beautiful, right?

339
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:39,844
I'll throw acid on your face,
I don't care if you're ugly.

340
00:35:40,037 --> 00:35:40,913
I'll marry you.

341
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:42,812
Listen carefully!

342
00:35:43,007 --> 00:35:45,453
If anyone dares to see her,
I'll gouge out your eyes.

343
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:46,519
Be careful!

344
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,825
Is it him?
- Yes, sir.

345
00:35:53,017 --> 00:35:54,155
He's the man!

346
00:35:54,352 --> 00:35:55,660
Where can we find him, sir?

347
00:35:55,853 --> 00:35:57,662
Come, arrest him right now.

348
00:35:57,855 --> 00:36:00,335
He's torturing the girl.

349
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:01,799
I saw with my eyes, sir.

350
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:05,270
He brought her out from house forcibly
and tortured her, sir.

351
00:36:05,463 --> 00:36:08,171
When did you see the incident?

352
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:10,243
At about $30 am today morning.

353
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:12,675
What's the time now?
- 1.15 pm, sir.

354
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:16,909
The incident happened 5 hours ago,
did I get at least one complaint?

355
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:19,281
People shiver on seeing him

356
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:24,090
You've seen only his open activities
in day time.

357
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:29,157
His underground activities are
totally different at night.

358
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:04,057
Sathya, that's Rai!

359
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:20,348
Stop Sathya! I need to talk to you.

360
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:47,534
What?

361
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:50,405
Come, I need to talk to you, Samhya.

362
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:54,174
How much do you make in this oil business?

363
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:55,578
Why do you want to know?

364
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:59,683
If you tell me the truth,
I'll reveal a shocking truth to you.

365
00:37:59,877 --> 00:38:02,118
What's it?
- You tell me first.

366
00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:04,987
How much Oil Raj makes in this business?

367
00:38:05,182 --> 00:38:06,252
Rs.25 lakhs.

368
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:11,559
He has planned to kill you by paying
Rs.25 lakhs to Kutty of Srirajpura

369
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:14,694
What are you saying?

370
00:38:14,892 --> 00:38:16,894
Take this cassette, listen to it.

371
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:24,169
Sathya, I want your friendship.

372
00:38:24,368 --> 00:38:27,076
Let's share 50-50 the money
we make in this oil business.

373
00:38:27,271 --> 00:38:30,650
Make a quick plan to finish Kutty
and Oil Raj.

374
00:38:31,275 --> 00:38:32,276
Where can I find Kutty?

375
00:38:41,752 --> 00:38:43,823
Advance of Rs.25000.

376
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:47,901
Is it that easy to kill Sathya, Raju?

377
00:38:48,192 --> 00:38:51,605
If you pay Rs. 1 lakh as advance,
I'll do this job.

378
00:38:52,697 --> 00:38:56,873
But if you fail in this job,
I'll lose my head.

379
00:38:57,201 --> 00:39:00,182
He'll come to know that
I killed his boss Kay Raj.

380
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:01,645
Are you betraying me?

381
00:39:44,181 --> 00:39:45,819
No...no...Sathya_..no...

382
00:40:00,097 --> 00:40:01,576
Government Hospital

383
00:41:22,947 --> 00:41:26,087
Handle the case and take action.
- Sure, sir.

384
00:41:27,184 --> 00:41:28,891
Get the post monem report.

385
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:34,195
She is"
- Oil Raj's wife Maria

386
00:41:34,391 --> 00:41:36,393
Do you know who killed Oil Raj?

387
00:41:36,594 --> 00:41:39,165
She saw the killer who killed Oil Raj.

388
00:41:39,363 --> 00:41:41,741
Sathya killed him.
- Sathya?

389
00:41:41,932 --> 00:41:43,912
You mean...?
- Yes, the same Sathya.

390
00:41:44,101 --> 00:41:46,911
You've eye witness, right?
Can't you arrest him?

391
00:41:47,104 --> 00:41:49,414
I can arrest him but he's absconding

392
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:50,984
Our dept. is trying hard to arrest him.

393
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:53,678
Wherever he may go,
he'll surely come to Madhuri's house.

394
00:41:53,878 --> 00:41:55,084
You can arrest him there

395
00:41:57,081 --> 00:41:58,151
Madhuri's house!

396
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:20,073
Gita, I'm giving you 10 minutes time,
get Madhuri here, got it?- Listen to me.

397
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:24,083
I don't have time to talk.
If you don't do as I order...

398
00:42:24,275 --> 00:42:25,948
No...no...I'll go.

399
00:42:28,345 --> 00:42:32,555
Police in civil dress will be observing,
nobody must know anything.

400
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:33,524
Go.

401
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:37,196
No way! I'll not come.

402
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:39,231
Please don't say no, Madhu.

403
00:42:39,423 --> 00:42:42,893
If you don't come, he'll harm my parents

404
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:47,107
He'll never harm you,
you know that very well.

405
00:42:48,198 --> 00:42:51,736
He has sent me here hold
my parents at knife point.

406
00:42:52,036 --> 00:42:55,916
If we don't reach there in 10 minute;
he may kill my parents

407
00:42:56,106 --> 00:42:59,519
I beg you humbly.

408
00:42:59,777 --> 00:43:01,415
Please don't say no to me.

409
00:43:08,118 --> 00:43:09,290
Look there!

410
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:52,428
For your sake only! Even if entire earth
turns against me, I'll not leave you, Madhu.

411
00:44:52,623 --> 00:44:53,499
Don't cry, Madhu...

412
00:44:54,091 --> 00:44:55,069
Don't worry...

413
00:44:56,593 --> 00:44:58,539
Don't worry...

414
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:05,912
We can't live anymore, Madhu.

415
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:19,956
DF°P your guns!

416
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:21,525
If not I'll kill her.

417
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:26,827
Stay away!

418
00:45:36,934 --> 00:45:38,743
Don't follow us, Inspector:

419
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:41,272
Don't worry, Madhu

420
00:45:41,472 --> 00:45:42,109
Stop there!

421
00:45:43,774 --> 00:45:46,653
I'm there with you.

422
00:45:53,951 --> 00:46:00,391
You know he's a terrible goon,
why did you bring Madhuri to him?

423
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:01,899
How are you connected to him?

424
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:05,562
I don't have any connection with him

425
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:10,567
He threatened to kill my parents
if I don't bring Madhuri here.

426
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:14,739
That's why I...
- Okay, but why is he mad after you?

427
00:46:14,972 --> 00:46:18,181
Though she hates him,
he loves her madly

428
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:19,513
'NW?

429
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:21,846
Love is like that!

430
00:46:22,379 --> 00:46:24,723
It changes people beyond recognition.

431
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:29,758
Few years back, you won't believe me
if I tell how he was!

432
00:46:30,187 --> 00:46:31,393
How was he?

433
00:47:12,696 --> 00:47:18,510
Hey Sun...giver oflife...
come to earth...

434
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:26,512
Come to light up this earth...

435
00:47:28,712 --> 00:47:32,250
Remove ego from life...

436
00:47:33,917 --> 00:47:38,889
Fill hearts with holy mono syllable OM...

437
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:35,685
Good intentions are enough,
do I need day dreams?

438
00:48:35,879 --> 00:48:40,828
A home filled with love is enough,
do I need life of silver and gold?

439
00:48:41,018 --> 00:48:45,990
Parents are living Gods...
Guru is our life...

440
00:48:46,189 --> 00:48:51,537
Let this holy hymn fill my heart...

441
00:49:48,251 --> 00:49:53,132
Bless Kanndigas to be truthful
and honest...

442
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:58,568
Mercy and generosity
be prime duty of them...

443
00:49:58,762 --> 00:50:03,762
Bless us with compassionate heart
to help poor and destitute as our own...

444
00:51:31,221 --> 00:51:32,723
Dheena will be waiting for me

445
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:34,527
Lecturer is killing us here.

446
00:51:34,691 --> 00:51:35,863
Don't know when the bell will ring!

447
00:51:42,866 --> 00:51:43,867
Where did she go away?

448
00:51:57,247 --> 00:52:02,219
Every minute I wait for you
is like razor cutting me

449
00:52:02,419 --> 00:52:04,057
I too feel the same, Dheena

450
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:19,413
Is it him?

451
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:22,582
Where is she?
- Still hasn't come, boss

452
00:52:28,211 --> 00:52:30,282
Why? What happened to you?

453
00:52:31,181 --> 00:52:34,924
That dirty Dheena gave me lip to lip kiss,
he sucked my tongue into his mouth.

454
00:52:35,118 --> 00:52:36,392
Is it mouth? Dirty drain!

455
00:52:39,022 --> 00:52:41,093
Boss, look Madhu is there.

456
00:52:45,929 --> 00:52:48,876
Boss she really loves you.
- Yes.

457
00:52:49,699 --> 00:52:51,576
We must enjoy this
do you've a cigarette?

458
00:52:51,768 --> 00:52:52,769
Give.
- I've it.

459
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:07,289
Hey Shastry! Come here!

460
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:14,159
What?

461
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:15,961
Smoke a cigarette.

462
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:17,638
I don't have smoking habit.

463
00:53:18,428 --> 00:53:19,236
I said smoke cigarette

464
00:53:19,429 --> 00:53:21,272
Look, I don't...
- Take it.

465
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:23,439
\Mll you smoke or not?

466
00:53:24,434 --> 00:53:25,412
Please don't force it on me.

467
00:53:25,602 --> 00:53:29,106
If you don't smoke, I'll cut your face.

468
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:30,577
Take it.

469
00:53:48,592 --> 00:53:49,263
How is it?

470
00:53:51,928 --> 00:53:52,531
Keep quiet.

471
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,913
Do it first and then say sorry.

472
00:54:00,103 --> 00:54:01,480
Come, let's complain to principal.

473
00:54:01,671 --> 00:54:03,173
They're doing too much.

474
00:54:03,373 --> 00:54:06,149
We're unable to move freely
because of such rogues.

475
00:54:06,343 --> 00:54:08,880
Whatever may happen,
let's complain, come Sathya.

476
00:54:10,313 --> 00:54:12,987
They're worst guys our life will turn hard.

477
00:54:13,183 --> 00:54:16,221
Do you know what would happen
if we complain against them?

478
00:54:17,187 --> 00:54:19,565
My home is in the area of his brother:

479
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:23,102
You don't know about his background.

480
00:54:23,293 --> 00:54:25,569
MBS College
College Union Day

481
00:54:31,034 --> 00:54:33,275
How is my get up?
- Fantastic!

482
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:35,541
You'll surely get first prize

483
00:54:41,678 --> 00:54:43,783
This guy always throws up on seeing me.

484
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:45,051
Thrash him tomorrow.

485
00:54:51,221 --> 00:54:53,394
Why do you always throw up on seeing him?

486
00:54:56,726 --> 00:54:57,966
He threw up on me!

487
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:03,244
Not just on seeing you, he threw up
on me for mentioning your name, boss.

488
00:55:03,433 --> 00:55:04,434
Nasty smell!

489
00:55:09,439 --> 00:55:13,683
If we had Hanuman also...
- I'll get him now.

490
00:55:16,246 --> 00:55:19,159
Come..come fast...

491
00:55:20,216 --> 00:55:21,217
Come, I'll tell you.

492
00:55:21,418 --> 00:55:22,761
Come...come...

493
00:55:28,925 --> 00:55:37,401
How did you manage to come here,
tell me O monkey?

494
00:55:41,438 --> 00:55:45,250
Wham am I to tell, you devil?

495
00:55:45,442 --> 00:55:46,750
How dare you call me devil!

496
00:56:07,931 --> 00:56:10,639
Give me TC, sir.
I'll leave this college, sir.

497
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,072
Why? Just 3 months for exam,
you wan to leave college now?

498
00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:15,806
Please don't ask me the reason, sir.

499
00:56:16,005 --> 00:56:18,849
I know the reason, that Dheena..

500
00:56:28,852 --> 00:56:32,061
Is it principalis office or
wash basin for you?

501
00:56:33,590 --> 00:56:37,060
Boss, today is 'Rakhi' festival,
girls are coming to tie rakhis

502
00:56:41,131 --> 00:56:44,408
If we tie rakhi, today, we'll not have
any problem form tomorrow.

503
00:56:44,601 --> 00:56:46,638
All are in that class room.

504
00:56:49,272 --> 00:56:50,649
Look, Sathya is there!

505
00:56:50,874 --> 00:56:53,980
Samhya, come here for a minute.
- Why him?- Keep quiet.

506
00:56:57,113 --> 00:56:57,818
What?

507
00:56:58,515 --> 00:57:00,495
Than is"
-Want to tie rakhi?

508
00:57:00,784 --> 00:57:01,421
Not for that.

509
00:57:01,618 --> 00:57:04,189
Dheena is troubling you so much,
why don't you hit him back?

510
00:57:04,387 --> 00:57:05,798
I'm not coming to college for than.

511
00:57:05,989 --> 00:57:08,162
If not at least make him your friend.

512
00:57:08,358 --> 00:57:11,066
I can't bear to see you getting
tortured by him.

513
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:12,171
Isn't it?

514
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:18,371
These are sweets,
today is Dheena's birthday.

515
00:57:18,568 --> 00:57:19,911
He's in that class room

516
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:22,208
Give him this and become his friend

517
00:57:22,405 --> 00:57:24,407
Look, I don't want anyone's friendship

518
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:30,357
I don't like a brilliant student
like you getting ragged by him

519
00:57:30,547 --> 00:57:36,623
You've to befriend him, if not I'll complain
to police that he's ragging you

520
00:57:38,655 --> 00:57:43,070
Please give him this and become
his friend at least for my sake.

521
00:57:43,259 --> 00:57:47,173
Look, if this can make you happy;
I'll give it to him.

522
00:57:49,632 --> 00:57:50,633
Now watch the fun!

523
00:57:52,769 --> 00:57:54,112
Who is it?

524
00:57:55,271 --> 00:57:56,443
It's Shastry!

525
00:57:56,773 --> 00:57:57,751
Open the door!

526
00:58:00,677 --> 00:58:02,588
I got scared some girl was here
to tie rakhi.

527
00:58:02,779 --> 00:58:04,816
What's the matter, Shastry?

528
00:58:05,248 --> 00:58:07,626
Take sweets.
- Sweets? Why?

529
00:58:08,284 --> 00:58:10,389
It seems today is your birthday.
- Birthday?

530
00:58:10,854 --> 00:58:12,856
I don't know my birth dame also!

531
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:15,060
Are you all my friends?

532
00:58:16,025 --> 00:58:17,402
Learn from Shastry.

533
00:58:17,927 --> 00:58:19,167
Give me...give...

534
00:58:20,096 --> 00:58:21,302
You're very good boy.

535
00:58:21,631 --> 00:58:22,769
Go...go...

536
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:29,848
Wait...wait...
- For me, boss...

537
00:58:38,248 --> 00:58:42,958
Tie...tie...
Brother... Brother...

538
00:59:20,590 --> 00:59:23,070
How dare you made my lover
to tie rakhi to me!

539
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:24,898
Tie rakhi to me!

540
00:59:25,094 --> 00:59:26,402
\Mll you make her my sister?

541
00:59:28,364 --> 00:59:29,399
Kick him, boys!

542
00:59:38,274 --> 00:59:40,254
Are you humans or beasts?

543
00:59:40,443 --> 00:59:42,081
All of you've joined to hit him.

544
00:59:42,278 --> 00:59:45,054
Look at him, how dare!

545
00:59:45,348 --> 00:59:48,625
You tied rakhi to me without knowing
in the scene he created.

546
00:59:48,818 --> 00:59:50,923
I didn't do it unwittingly,
I did it wantonly.

547
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:51,723
'NW?

548
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:54,993
I gave him the box to get you out.

549
00:59:58,394 --> 01:00:00,169
For God's sake, no please..

550
01:00:06,836 --> 01:00:11,444
It means..don't you love me?
- What? Love you?

551
01:00:11,641 --> 01:00:13,314
Who said I love you?

552
01:00:13,509 --> 01:00:16,854
Just because I'm friendly,
will you mistake it as love?

553
01:00:22,285 --> 01:00:25,892
Are you human?
Do you've any humaneness?

554
01:00:26,089 --> 01:00:29,502
Why are you making him
a scapegoat in your game?

555
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:34,905
What did he do to you?
Do you know his family condition?

556
01:00:35,098 --> 01:00:39,240
You ruined the clothes his sister struggled
in tailoring shop to stitch it.

557
01:00:39,435 --> 01:00:42,416
You're ruining student's careers who come to
college under severe economical situation.

558
01:00:42,605 --> 01:00:45,381
I swear on God, none of you
will ever come good in life

559
01:00:45,575 --> 01:00:46,576
All of you would get ruined.

560
01:00:46,776 --> 01:00:47,686
Come on, boys

561
01:01:10,266 --> 01:01:11,574
Sathya, one minute"

562
01:01:11,768 --> 01:01:13,406
I know you're angry on me

563
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:19,510
I did for fun only, I didn't know that
rascal would take it so seriously.

564
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:26,150
I'm not angry on anyone, if you really
want to help me, leave me alone

565
01:01:38,561 --> 01:01:45,069
Sathya, you need at least 10 or 15 days
to copy this text book

566
01:01:45,435 --> 01:01:48,314
This is my brother's text book, use it.
Please take it.

567
01:01:48,504 --> 01:01:50,245
Do you think I'm not well enough
to buy text book also?

568
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:51,418
No, not like that.

569
01:01:51,607 --> 01:01:55,521
Instead of reading ten times,
writing once is better, so I'm copying it.

570
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:57,419
Please don't disturb me often.

571
01:02:12,762 --> 01:02:13,832
Calm down boys!

572
01:02:14,530 --> 01:02:16,601
Look, this is final warning

573
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:20,542
lfl see you with her again,
I'll disfigure your face.

574
01:02:21,471 --> 01:02:24,111
Why are you looking at her?
Get going!

575
01:02:28,211 --> 01:02:31,522
You know very well
how much I love you, Madhuri?

576
01:02:31,848 --> 01:02:35,887
If you move with him...
- What will you do man?

577
01:02:36,085 --> 01:02:38,929
I'll move with anyone I like in college,
are you the lord of this college?

578
01:02:39,122 --> 01:02:43,161
I don't mind getting abused by you,
abuse me but stay with me

579
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:46,636
If you go away from me,
I'll go mad, Madhuri.

580
01:02:46,829 --> 01:02:49,070
Go mad? You're mad always!

581
01:02:53,402 --> 01:02:55,404
Samhya, one minute please

582
01:02:58,107 --> 01:02:59,643
I need to talk to you

583
01:03:01,377 --> 01:03:02,412
Please stop for a minute.

584
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:03,951
I need to tell you something

585
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:09,389
You told me the matter,
why are you still after me?

586
01:03:11,721 --> 01:03:13,064
Do you know what this is?
Blade!

587
01:03:13,256 --> 01:03:15,099
Do you know what this is?
Blood!

588
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:18,170
If you don't talk to me,
I'll keep on cutting myself.

589
01:03:24,066 --> 01:03:25,409
Tell me, what's it?

01:03:40,449 --> 01:03:41,723
Wham happened to you?
Have you gone mad?

594
01:03:41,918 --> 01:03:44,421
Yes I've gone mad.
Won't you love me?

595
01:03:45,454 --> 01:03:46,489
Please listen to me

596
01:03:47,857 --> 01:03:49,837
Than is..
- What's this Madhuri?

597
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:51,331
Why are you interfering?

598
01:03:53,262 --> 01:03:57,870
Didn't I warn you today morning?

599
01:04:01,804 --> 01:04:05,183
I love him..l like him...

Poor boy...poor boy...

Ironing clothes"

609
01:05:48,311 --> 01:05:52,919
Urgency to reach love...

610

Heart is myth...

617

Magicm. illusion...fantasy...

618

Cheetah... deer...

620

Who are you?
At this late hour.

624

Who is he?

625
01:09:05,674 --> 01:09:08,917
Where are you going, Samhya?
- Father, go inside I'll come back now.

626
01:09:09,111 --> 01:09:10,886
Father, please go inside

Who are they?
- I don't know.

631
01:09:21,257 --> 01:09:22,099
Hubby"

632
01:09:23,092 --> 01:09:23,832
Bloody...

633
01:09:25,594 --> 01:09:29,508
Look, you know very well about me
and my business

634
01:09:29,698 --> 01:09:33,407
Since you're my area's priest's son,
I came here to advice you

635
01:09:33,602 --> 01:09:37,106
It seems my brother loves
a girl Madhuri in college.

636
01:09:37,306 --> 01:09:39,752
My family isn't a family to fall in love

637
01:09:39,942 --> 01:09:41,080
We belong to a family of rapists

638
01:09:41,277 --> 01:09:42,915
By mistake he has fallen in love with her.

639
01:09:43,145 --> 01:09:46,615
If my brother is out of mood, so do I!

640
01:09:46,815 --> 01:09:50,160
If I go out of mood,
so does this entire area!

641
01:09:50,586 --> 01:09:52,429
Got it? Go to bed.

642
01:09:52,755 --> 01:09:53,426
Bye.

643
01:09:57,259 --> 01:09:59,739
You're saying this after good
thought about it, right?- Yes.

644
01:09:59,929 --> 01:10:03,433
We mustn't meet in college,
we must meet without their knowledge.

645
01:10:03,632 --> 01:10:05,236
But still he may come to know.

646
01:10:05,434 --> 01:10:08,506
Leave it, forget me and be happy.

647
01:10:09,104 --> 01:10:10,082
Please don't say like that.

648
01:10:10,706 --> 01:10:12,083
Impossible to forget you in this life.

649
01:10:12,274 --> 01:10:14,652
Impossible for you stand up
to Dheena in this life

650
01:10:15,477 --> 01:10:21,484
If we get married and if anyone threatens
you to send your wife for a night, you...

651
01:10:21,684 --> 01:10:24,494
Why do you talk like this?

652
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:26,158
I'm telling truth

653
01:10:26,355 --> 01:10:29,495
I hate to call such a coward as my lover.

654
01:10:32,194 --> 01:10:32,763
Look there!

655
01:10:35,297 --> 01:10:37,743
Those bulls are soft animals!

656
01:10:38,167 --> 01:10:39,737
How hard they're working for men!

657
01:10:39,935 --> 01:10:40,970
But look there!

658
01:10:42,571 --> 01:10:45,450
How happily the honey bees
are living in its nest!

659
01:10:45,741 --> 01:10:48,585
People know those bulls will
not attack even if you hit them.

660
01:10:48,777 --> 01:10:50,552
But if you hit that honeycomb?

661
01:10:53,415 --> 01:10:57,886
Instead of dying a death every day
in cowardice, die once like a hero.

662
01:10:58,087 --> 01:11:01,330
Even if you live for 2 days only,
you've to live like Tiger!

663
01:11:01,523 --> 01:11:05,403
Look at your hand, it's like iron!
But no courage.

664
01:11:05,594 --> 01:11:08,734
If you hit him with this hand,
he'll get knocked-out in one punch.

665
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:12,079
Think over it, Sathyam.
think over it...

666
01:11:12,301 --> 01:11:14,178
What a lovely figure he has
managed to trap!

667
01:11:15,204 --> 01:11:16,080
He has come to park to love her!

668
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:17,910
Shastry is doing this!

669
01:11:20,376 --> 01:11:23,880
Sathya, just hit them!

670
01:11:27,683 --> 01:11:31,927
Hit them once, you'll know
what violence is!

671
01:11:32,121 --> 01:11:32,826
Go!

672
01:11:33,622 --> 01:11:34,828
Go...hit them!

673
01:11:35,424 --> 01:11:37,426
Please send him, baby!

674
01:11:37,626 --> 01:11:40,732
Here comes Shastry like a punter!

675
01:11:47,503 --> 01:11:48,777
Let him come, who cares!

676
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:51,611
If she tells, how dare you come here!

677
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:53,081
Get lost!

678
01:11:53,842 --> 01:11:56,516
Get lost form here, Shastry!

679
01:12:16,432 --> 01:12:19,242
That's this world is!
That's all life of violence is!

680
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:23,750
If you rise hand, they'll fall at your feet,
if not they'll hold your collar.

681
01:12:23,939 --> 01:12:26,476
He's a goon who hits anyone
without care or bother!

682
01:12:26,675 --> 01:12:27,517
He's a goon!

683
01:12:45,928 --> 01:12:46,736
Come here!

684
01:12:47,329 --> 01:12:49,331
Go...bash him!

685
01:12:49,531 --> 01:12:50,509
Don't think!

686
01:13:01,610 --> 01:13:02,554
Bloody...

687
01:13:39,915 --> 01:13:41,053
Get up, Sathya!

688
01:13:46,922 --> 01:13:50,267
Take this chain, hit them..
don't spare them!

689
01:15:23,919 --> 01:15:27,628
Samhya, take it!

690
01:16:09,765 --> 01:16:10,300
Run away!

691
01:16:31,453 --> 01:16:33,899
Inspector, Sathya hacked them!

692
01:17:26,975 --> 01:17:28,318
Kay Raj is here!

693
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:52,510
Aren't you ashamed?

694
01:17:52,701 --> 01:17:54,840
You got beaten by a Brahmin boy!

695
01:17:55,303 --> 01:17:56,338
That boy is...

696
01:18:01,109 --> 01:18:04,579
Hey loafer! You were sent to college to study,
getting involved in hooliganism.

697
01:18:04,780 --> 01:18:08,728
Get up, boy!
- Thrash him...get up I say!

698
01:18:09,418 --> 01:18:10,829
Won't you listen if sir says?

699
01:18:11,019 --> 01:18:11,759
Hooliganism?

700
01:18:12,587 --> 01:18:13,292
Hit him.

701
01:18:13,989 --> 01:18:16,833
He must get sense by morning with thrashing.

702
01:18:17,025 --> 01:18:19,403
Taking to violence...

703
01:18:22,097 --> 01:18:23,167
Are you a goon?

704
01:18:25,567 --> 01:18:26,875
Inspector is coming.

705
01:18:29,938 --> 01:18:33,579
He has lost out, wake him up and hit him.

706
01:18:34,976 --> 01:18:35,954
Bloody loafer!

707
01:18:36,144 --> 01:18:39,125
Instead of offering prayers like Brahmin,
he's picking weapon to become a goon.

708
01:18:39,314 --> 01:18:40,622
We must thrash such guys.

709
01:18:40,816 --> 01:18:44,059
If Brahmins too take to violence,
what will happen to this country, sir?

710
01:18:46,321 --> 01:18:47,959
Greetings
- Greetings Kay Raj.

711
01:18:48,156 --> 01:18:50,466
It seems you arrested a boy
from MBS college.

712
01:18:50,659 --> 01:18:53,572
That boy...he thrashed 7 people
and cut a man's hand.

713
01:18:53,762 --> 01:18:54,740
We've booked half murder case on him

714
01:18:54,930 --> 01:18:56,739
Take his bail.
0Release the boy.

715
01:18:59,601 --> 01:19:01,444
Why are you looking at my face?
Release him

716
01:19:01,670 --> 01:19:03,343
Simha, get him out.

717
01:19:11,113 --> 01:19:12,717
Are you humans or demons?

718
01:19:12,914 --> 01:19:14,723
Just because you got him,
you thrashed him like hell.

719
01:19:14,916 --> 01:19:15,758
Leave him!

720
01:19:16,918 --> 01:19:17,487
Come

721
01:19:19,755 --> 01:19:21,063
Keep it here

722
01:19:23,759 --> 01:19:25,329
Have it... eat well!

723
01:19:28,196 --> 01:19:29,573
You're a Brahmin, right?

724
01:19:30,899 --> 01:19:32,469
Till now you were a Brahmin.

725
01:19:32,667 --> 01:19:35,170
After picking up weapon,
you belong to warrior caste.

726
01:19:35,370 --> 01:19:37,350
You need strength eat well.

727
01:19:40,075 --> 01:19:41,850
Why did you bring me here?

728
01:19:42,377 --> 01:19:43,651
Tell me that!

729
01:19:44,412 --> 01:19:45,618
If you don't want, leave it.

730
01:19:46,548 --> 01:19:47,618
Wham did you say your name is?

731
01:19:47,883 --> 01:19:50,363
Samhya, right? You thrashed eight of my men.

732
01:19:50,552 --> 01:19:51,724
I need to appreciate your strength

733
01:19:52,487 --> 01:19:54,763
You join my gang.
I'll pay as much as you ask.

734
01:19:57,425 --> 01:20:00,895
I didn't hit them to become a goon.

735
01:20:01,797 --> 01:20:02,639
Please forgive me

736
01:20:03,365 --> 01:20:04,105
I'll go.

737
01:20:08,370 --> 01:20:10,441
Wait...wait...
- Let him go.

738
01:20:39,601 --> 01:20:41,581
Open the door, Madhu

739
01:20:42,204 --> 01:20:43,512
I need to talk to you

740
01:20:44,372 --> 01:20:48,081
I don't open my door to street goons

741
01:20:52,681 --> 01:20:52,954
What are you saying?

742
01:20:54,015 --> 01:20:57,485
You encouraged me to hit them!

743
01:20:57,786 --> 01:20:58,856
Why did you make me do it?

744
01:20:59,788 --> 01:21:03,065
For betrayal you did to me,
this punishment is too light.

745
01:21:03,258 --> 01:21:04,066
Betraya]?

746
01:21:05,026 --> 01:21:06,835
Wham did I do to you?

747
01:21:08,930 --> 01:21:10,409
Do you know whose photo that is?

748
01:21:16,304 --> 01:21:19,183
Harish!
- My elder who loved me so much.

749
01:21:45,233 --> 01:21:45,973
Brother!

750
01:21:46,434 --> 01:21:47,276
Mother!

751
01:21:47,535 --> 01:21:48,513
Wham happened to you, mother?

752
01:22:09,658 --> 01:22:10,398
Brother!

753
01:22:13,929 --> 01:22:18,400
Mothenmbrother...

754
01:22:19,501 --> 01:22:20,104
Brother!

755
01:22:23,104 --> 01:22:26,085
Brothen... brother...

756
01:22:34,749 --> 01:22:35,727
Accused hangs himself in lock up!

757
01:22:44,526 --> 01:22:46,062
Did brother do like this?

758
01:22:46,261 --> 01:22:48,741
No, father.
I didn't do it, father.

759
01:22:48,930 --> 01:22:50,341
I swear on you, father, I didn't do it.

760
01:22:50,532 --> 01:22:52,239
Then, who did it?

761
01:23:05,213 --> 01:23:06,749
Sathya, get the table.

762
01:23:09,451 --> 01:23:11,988
Come here
Send them out.

763
01:23:12,187 --> 01:23:12,858
Go...go...

764
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:33,981
Leave me..leave me...

765
01:23:34,476 --> 01:23:39,391
Leave me..leave me please..

766
01:23:41,282 --> 01:23:43,262
No...no...leave me...

767
01:23:45,253 --> 01:23:48,234
No...please listen to me"

768
01:23:49,090 --> 01:23:49,625
Hey you...

769
01:23:54,195 --> 01:23:55,071
Leave me!

770
01:23:57,932 --> 01:24:00,412
Leave me..leave me...

771
01:24:08,309 --> 01:24:11,085
The girl is troubling you, boss
- No more.- Why?

772
01:24:11,279 --> 01:24:12,053
Look there!

773
01:24:15,517 --> 01:24:16,723
You killed her.

774
01:24:16,918 --> 01:24:21,333
I raped many girls till now,
she troubled me a lot.

775
01:24:24,259 --> 01:24:25,897
Just do I tell you.

776
01:24:35,303 --> 01:24:38,841
That boy raped her and
this boy is eye witness

777
01:25:03,598 --> 01:25:06,841
Yes he committed the crime.

778
01:25:11,539 --> 01:25:17,615
Though Sathya knew truth,
he got scared of goon and lied in court.

779
01:25:18,279 --> 01:25:22,887
Had he told the truth,
our family wouldn't be in this condition.

780
01:25:26,855 --> 01:25:31,167
For what you did to my brother,
the punishment I gave you is too light.

781
01:25:32,894 --> 01:25:36,398
I decided that day itself.
Joined your college

782
01:25:37,365 --> 01:25:39,345
Hit two birds with one shot!

783
01:25:41,169 --> 01:25:44,013
One is that goon and another is you!

784
01:25:46,274 --> 01:25:49,653
Madhu, it wasn't my mistake.

785
01:25:50,845 --> 01:25:55,055
Your life must be fine,
you don't care about other's life, right?

786
01:25:57,552 --> 01:25:58,496
Selfish man!

787
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:00,593
Never again show your face to me.

788
01:26:07,862 --> 01:26:09,432
Try to understand me

789
01:26:09,631 --> 01:26:11,235
My situation was like that day!

790
01:26:11,666 --> 01:26:14,647
If I had told truth against them...
- Your family was at stake.

791
01:26:14,836 --> 01:26:16,247
They would've killed you, right?

792
01:26:16,905 --> 01:26:19,249
How did you get the courage now?

793
01:26:21,409 --> 01:26:23,355
Love...love!

794
01:26:23,545 --> 01:26:24,615
That too on me!

795
01:26:28,316 --> 01:26:31,229
You'll do anything to get a girl!

796
01:26:31,519 --> 01:26:33,499
But for a friend...yuck!

797
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:40,301
You've misunderstood me
I...

798
01:26:41,496 --> 01:26:43,737
Please listen to me, Madhu.

799
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:02,393
Please don't do, hubby...

800
01:27:02,584 --> 01:27:04,063
Father, please don't...

801
01:27:06,754 --> 01:27:07,323
Father!

802
01:27:08,923 --> 01:27:10,061
Go inside"
- Father...

803
01:27:10,258 --> 01:27:11,396
Please listen to me, father...

804
01:27:11,759 --> 01:27:13,898
Mother... mother... mother...

805
01:27:16,097 --> 01:27:17,542
Father...father...

806
01:27:18,499 --> 01:27:21,070
Mother...please listen to me.

807
01:27:24,172 --> 01:27:26,516
Why nobody understands me?

808
01:27:27,041 --> 01:27:28,418
Wham was my fault, tell me?

809
01:27:28,977 --> 01:27:31,890
Though goons troubled me a lot,
didn't I keep quiet?

810
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:32,888
Tell me, father!

811
01:27:33,414 --> 01:27:35,724
Fearing consequences...

812
01:27:35,917 --> 01:27:36,987
Didn't I undergo everything till now?

813
01:27:37,185 --> 01:27:39,722
I'm also normal human, right father?
Tell me, father.

814
01:27:41,155 --> 01:27:43,726
Mother, at least you tell father.

815
01:27:43,925 --> 01:27:45,563
Please open the door, mother.

816
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:50,231
Mothermfathermplease listen to me.
- VUill you please keep quiet?

817
01:27:51,733 --> 01:27:55,909
So much happened in your life,
didn't I endure it silently?

818
01:27:56,271 --> 01:27:57,648
Tell me, father...tell me...

819
01:27:58,006 --> 01:28:01,419
Man needs patience and dedication
till he achieves his aim.

820
01:28:01,809 --> 01:28:04,050
I thought my son would become
like Sage Vasishta

821
01:28:04,445 --> 01:28:09,827
But didn't expect him to become Sage Vishwamithra
who lost his power for some Menaka

822
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:15,226
You were patient for so many years,
you couldn't be patient for 3 more months.

823
01:28:15,423 --> 01:28:17,027
You ruined your life

824
01:28:17,225 --> 01:28:20,297
Is that girl more important to you
than your parents?

825
01:28:22,030 --> 01:28:23,805
Go...go to her...

826
01:28:23,998 --> 01:28:25,238
You don't have any place in this house

827
01:28:25,433 --> 01:28:26,343
Get out.

828
01:28:50,591 --> 01:28:52,195
I can understand your situation very well.

829
01:28:52,393 --> 01:28:54,202
All the doors are closed on you!

830
01:28:54,395 --> 01:28:56,272
Only one door is open for you.

831
01:28:58,433 --> 01:29:03,041
We got into this profession
for some reason just like you.

832
01:29:03,237 --> 01:29:09,051
In this open world, people cheat,
betray and ruin lives with lies.

833
01:29:09,243 --> 01:29:12,383
But in underworld life,
we use weapons.

834
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:15,422
Instead of that battle of nerves,
this battle of strength is better.

835
01:29:15,616 --> 01:29:16,822
Come, join me.

836
01:29:17,151 --> 01:29:19,893
The society will never consider you
as good man now.

837
01:29:20,088 --> 01:29:23,729
There's only one option for you
to achieve anything in life.

838
01:29:24,559 --> 01:29:25,629
Think over it.

839
01:29:26,094 --> 01:29:28,165
Come...come with me, Samhya.

840
01:29:31,766 --> 01:29:34,645
He boarded the car then and
never got down from it again.

841
01:29:35,036 --> 01:29:39,212
The weapon she gave him earlier,
today it is playing with her life

842
01:29:39,574 --> 01:29:46,389
Though he ruined his life for her love,
he still loves her madly

843
01:29:46,581 --> 01:29:49,494
Gita, I'm getting bail tomorrow.

844
01:29:50,017 --> 01:29:53,089
Tell Madhuri that I'll meet her
at 5 pm in hotel.

845
01:29:53,388 --> 01:29:56,858
If she refuses, give her this letter

846
01:29:58,760 --> 01:30:03,175
He's not in a mood to talk.

847
01:30:03,431 --> 01:30:06,435
You can meet him some other day
to talk to him

848
01:30:06,601 --> 01:30:07,636
You please sit down

849
01:30:08,202 --> 01:30:15,381
He was well educated and I still can't
believe he could change like this.

850
01:30:15,576 --> 01:30:20,753
She's taking revenge on him for
killing her brother and mother

851
01:30:20,948 --> 01:30:25,192
He lied in court to save his parents
and sisters' lives

852
01:30:25,386 --> 01:30:28,663
Can't judge who is right
and who is wrong!

853
01:30:28,856 --> 01:30:31,666
Both are not wrong.
It's the mistake of situation

854
01:30:31,859 --> 01:30:35,739
Why is he calling Madhuri to some place?

855
01:30:35,930 --> 01:30:37,068
To love!

856
01:30:38,099 --> 01:30:41,512
How lovers meet in parks and film theatres!

857
01:30:41,702 --> 01:30:44,774
He makes her do it by force!

858
01:30:45,873 --> 01:30:49,753
Though love for her has ruined his life,

859
01:30:49,911 --> 01:30:53,518
his love for her hasn't diminished
a bit till dame!

860
01:30:54,615 --> 01:30:58,893
He still loves madly!

861
01:30:59,086 --> 01:31:02,192
Koli Manja...
- Deal?

862
01:31:03,324 --> 01:31:06,965
Japan...
- Sketch?

863
01:31:07,562 --> 01:31:08,734
Enough!

864
01:31:23,911 --> 01:31:32,057
My love..my love"
Come, let's romance"

865
01:31:40,528 --> 01:31:45,568
Mini dress is plus to Miss...
Public bus...O my God...

866
01:31:47,335 --> 01:31:51,750
If you miss BTS bus...it's kiss...
Dazzling dress is rocking...

867
01:31:53,708 --> 01:31:58,157
Walking fast...peacock shape...
My hean breaks again and again...

868
01:31:59,914 --> 01:32:04,329
Ice cream by two...cycle site"
Yes, love fight, its right...

869
01:32:06,521 --> 01:32:10,230
You're a top...spinning top...
A spinning top on my heart...

870
01:32:27,642 --> 01:32:35,322
Jasmine grown on guns...
It adores your tresses in millions..

871
01:32:35,516 --> 01:32:39,328
I'm a ruthless goon...
I love you...

872
01:32:39,754 --> 01:32:48,071
Your teenage is little perplexed...
My love is perplexed with grudge...

873
01:32:56,304 --> 01:33:00,980
You're my Madhubala, I'm your boy...
I'm all smiles on seeing you...

874
01:33:02,843 --> 01:33:04,720
You're a single lady
and I'm your body...

875
01:33:04,912 --> 01:33:07,051
If you fall at my feet,
we'll make a great pair...

876
01:33:09,116 --> 01:33:13,223
I'm little wrong but very strong...
Entire week is fun and happy...

877
01:33:15,323 --> 01:33:19,567
You're proud and arrogant...
If we remove it, you're nothing...

878
01:33:21,696 --> 01:33:25,303
You're horse..I'm horse"
My heart's cloud is honey...

879
01:34:24,925 --> 01:34:31,001
I'm a courageous man
acclaimed by the world...

880
01:34:31,198 --> 01:34:32,734
I've lost my way...

881
01:34:32,933 --> 01:34:36,676
I'm a robber like goon Ranganna
and thief Chikkanna...

882
01:34:37,004 --> 01:34:40,508
You're my God, I'm your devotee"

883
01:34:40,975 --> 01:34:44,889
This tiger of mountain is
cobweb to you...

884
01:34:45,413 --> 01:34:49,054
Wham apain...

885
01:34:53,954 --> 01:34:58,733
I love hot dosa...
It is calling me...

886
01:35:00,261 --> 01:35:04,403
You're kite, I'm the thread...
My heart yearns for special Manja on thread...

887
01:35:06,567 --> 01:35:10,913
I bought ticket in black to watch
your film of love but no use...

888
01:35:12,773 --> 01:35:17,051
I bought lottery ticket to win the
bumper prize of your heart in lucky draw...

889
01:35:19,213 --> 01:35:22,717
You're my Laila..
May I hug you once"

890
01:36:00,821 --> 01:36:01,822
Wham can we do?

891
01:36:02,590 --> 01:36:03,432
Sathya!

892
01:36:05,092 --> 01:36:06,400
Wait, Inspector!

893
01:36:06,594 --> 01:36:08,232
Lawyer, give him bail papers.

894
01:36:16,237 --> 01:36:17,079
Bye, Inspector:

895
01:36:20,841 --> 01:36:22,286
Look, how our country's system is!

896
01:36:34,822 --> 01:36:35,562
Brother!

897
01:36:43,931 --> 01:36:44,966
Are you doing fine, brother?

898
01:36:47,201 --> 01:36:47,872
Come

899
01:36:49,236 --> 01:36:51,876
Didn't Gowri come with you?

900
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:55,416
Promised to come at 5.30 pm.

901
01:36:55,976 --> 01:36:56,977
How is mother?

902
01:36:57,912 --> 01:36:59,619
Her asthma is on raise.

903
01:37:00,514 --> 01:37:02,619
She's always worried about you.

904
01:37:09,590 --> 01:37:10,227
Take it.

905
01:37:10,925 --> 01:37:13,098
Take mother to some good doctor.

906
01:37:13,327 --> 01:37:19,039
I'm lying about bonus and
increment to take money home.

907
01:37:19,233 --> 01:37:20,576
Father may get suspicious.

908
01:37:20,968 --> 01:37:22,345
You don't worry about that

909
01:37:22,803 --> 01:37:24,976
I'll make sure nobody knows about it.

910
01:37:25,773 --> 01:37:27,116
Got anything else to tell me?

911
01:37:27,308 --> 01:37:29,914
They're looking out for grooms
for me and Sujamha

912
01:37:30,110 --> 01:37:33,717
They're planning to sell the house
to conduct our marriages

913
01:37:33,914 --> 01:37:35,894
Wham? Sell house?

914
01:37:36,083 --> 01:37:37,960
No, I'll not let it happen.

915
01:37:38,519 --> 01:37:42,092
Let dowry be anything,
I'll arrange everything for your marriage.

916
01:37:44,692 --> 01:37:46,899
Call this number
when father is not in home.

917
01:37:48,095 --> 01:37:49,597
I'm yearning to meet mother.

918
01:37:53,934 --> 01:37:54,674
Brother!

919
01:37:55,936 --> 01:37:56,744
Brother!

920
01:37:59,206 --> 01:37:59,843
Brother!

921
01:38:08,148 --> 01:38:09,718
Take it, dear.
- No, brother:

922
01:38:09,917 --> 01:38:10,895
No problem, take it.

923
01:38:11,685 --> 01:38:12,663
Don't worry.

924
01:38:13,420 --> 01:38:14,990
I'll give this to every worker
in this factory.

925
01:38:15,189 --> 01:38:15,860
Take it.

926
01:38:17,992 --> 01:38:18,766
Take it.

927
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:20,329
Brother!

928
01:38:22,596 --> 01:38:23,404
Brother!

929
01:38:43,117 --> 01:38:44,824
What's this? Where are you going?

930
01:38:45,419 --> 01:38:46,489
To Sathya's place

931
01:38:47,254 --> 01:38:49,495
What? To Sathya's place?

932
01:38:49,723 --> 01:38:50,633
Yes, father.

933
01:38:51,492 --> 01:38:53,438
I've take this decision after
giving it good thought.

934
01:38:53,894 --> 01:38:55,498
I don't want anyone in trouble
because of me.

935
01:38:55,763 --> 01:38:58,573
For good or bad, I'll live with him.

936
01:38:58,933 --> 01:39:00,412
What are you saying?

937
01:39:00,601 --> 01:39:04,845
Father, please don't stop me.
Wherever I may be, I'll be fine.

938
01:39:05,406 --> 01:39:06,180
Bye.

939
01:39:18,585 --> 01:39:20,155
Madhu...you...?

940
01:39:20,754 --> 01:39:26,067
I'll not trouble you anymore,
I'm here to give myself completely to you.

941
01:39:26,260 --> 01:39:28,831
Take it...hereafter this body belongs to you.

942
01:39:31,598 --> 01:39:32,508
Just body?

943
01:39:33,100 --> 01:39:33,669
Heart?

944
01:39:33,901 --> 01:39:35,437
My heart will never be yours.

945
01:39:35,736 --> 01:39:37,238
You don't need it anyway, right?

946
01:40:03,931 --> 01:40:08,744
If I wanted your body only,
I would've got it long back

947
01:40:08,936 --> 01:40:09,641
But...

948
01:40:10,337 --> 01:40:12,681
I want your love, Madhu.

949
01:40:13,374 --> 01:40:14,409
I want your heart.

950
01:40:16,677 --> 01:40:21,626
In college, thought I said no,
you forcibly loved me.

951
01:40:22,049 --> 01:40:29,160
Whatever your intention may to love me,
but I sincerely loved you.

952
01:40:30,024 --> 01:40:31,230
I sincerely loved you.

953
01:40:33,794 --> 01:40:36,832
My life went through dramatic changes

954
01:40:37,598 --> 01:40:40,306
The reason for that is my love for you

955
01:40:41,201 --> 01:40:44,580
I ruined my life for your love.

956
01:40:45,706 --> 01:40:48,915
If I don't get you, why should I live?

957
01:40:49,610 --> 01:40:52,318
Madhu, I want only your love.

958
01:40:53,013 --> 01:40:56,961
Just for once say I love you!

959
01:40:57,584 --> 01:40:58,892
Say I love you!

960
01:41:22,776 --> 01:41:23,652
Once more please!

961
01:42:09,022 --> 01:42:12,731
Wham happened?
- Take him to hospital quickly.

962
01:42:15,529 --> 01:42:17,907
Why are you running like this, Madhuri?
What happened?

963
01:42:18,098 --> 01:42:19,771
I killed Sathya!

964
01:42:22,936 --> 01:42:24,313
What are you saying?

965
01:42:24,571 --> 01:42:26,414
I'm telling you truth.

966
01:42:26,607 --> 01:42:30,714
Unable to bear his torture anymore,
I killed him

967
01:42:31,445 --> 01:42:33,550
I had no other choice

968
01:42:35,082 --> 01:42:37,494
Please take me to police station.

969
01:42:38,352 --> 01:42:40,059
I want to surrender.

970
01:42:42,422 --> 01:42:43,400
Come, sit.

971
01:42:58,772 --> 01:43:00,046
Why did you come to my house?

972
01:43:00,240 --> 01:43:01,344
Please get down.

973
01:43:01,542 --> 01:43:03,021
No, I want to go to police station.

974
01:43:03,210 --> 01:43:04,712
We can go later, please get down now.

975
01:43:04,912 --> 01:43:08,155
No, I must go to police station
-We'll go, please come.

976
01:43:12,986 --> 01:43:14,897
Never do anything in haste.

977
01:43:15,789 --> 01:43:18,497
Tell me now, what had happened there?

978
01:43:35,008 --> 01:43:37,887
Did you think I'm dead?

979
01:43:39,079 --> 01:43:40,786
I'll not die so easily, Madhu.

980
01:43:42,783 --> 01:43:47,493
Don't know why I'm losing today!

981
01:43:48,355 --> 01:43:49,993
The respect I've for you inside me,

982
01:43:50,591 --> 01:43:56,166
you missed the target
and hit me here.

983
01:43:56,463 --> 01:44:00,536
But I'll not miss my target today!

984
01:44:03,136 --> 01:44:07,107
I wanted to take your body
after getting your heart.

985
01:44:07,741 --> 01:44:12,053
No, let's see who wins this game of love?

986
01:44:13,680 --> 01:44:16,889
I'll enjoy with you today,
let me what you can do!

987
01:44:17,084 --> 01:44:19,894
Samhya, stop there!

988
01:44:20,087 --> 01:44:21,430
I'm warning you

989
01:44:21,622 --> 01:44:22,760
If you dare touch her...

990
01:44:22,956 --> 01:44:25,334
Who the hell are you to ask me?

991
01:44:25,525 --> 01:44:26,560
If I touch her, what will you do?

992
01:44:26,760 --> 01:44:29,604
Don't talk like a mad man in crazy mood.

993
01:44:29,796 --> 01:44:33,005
Please leave the place,
you don't know about me.

994
01:44:33,200 --> 01:44:34,873
Who cares who you are!

995
01:44:35,068 --> 01:44:36,103
Do you know who I am?

996
01:44:36,303 --> 01:44:41,218
I'm also warning you,
stay out of this issue between us,

997
01:44:41,408 --> 01:44:42,512
Don't unnecessarily ruin your life.

998
01:44:42,709 --> 01:44:45,622
It is you who is ruining life

999
01:44:45,812 --> 01:44:49,385
My life is already ruined.

1000
01:44:49,583 --> 01:44:52,655
Look, don't stretch the argument.
Move away.

1001
01:44:52,853 --> 01:44:54,526
I'll not move, what will you do?

1002
01:44:54,721 --> 01:44:57,895
Don't test my patience!

1003
01:44:58,091 --> 01:45:01,402
I'm ready to give my life
but I'll not let you touch her.

1004
01:45:01,595 --> 01:45:02,733
Wham the hell will you do, man?

1005
01:45:03,930 --> 01:45:04,533
Leave me"

1006
01:45:04,931 --> 01:45:05,500
Leave me"

1007
01:45:06,066 --> 01:45:06,669
Move"

1008
01:45:14,708 --> 01:45:15,982
How dare you slap me!

1009
01:45:16,209 --> 01:45:17,916
I'll slap you, what the hell will you do man?

1010
01:45:18,111 --> 01:45:20,785
Will you kill me? Come on, kill me.
Kill me!

1011
01:45:20,981 --> 01:45:22,255
I'll not kill you.

1012
01:45:24,785 --> 01:45:26,890
Leave me..leave me...

1013
01:45:27,587 --> 01:45:31,399
Leave me..leave me...

1014
01:45:34,094 --> 01:45:36,404
Leave me..leave me...

1015
01:45:38,932 --> 01:45:40,240
No Sathyam.

1016
01:46:09,463 --> 01:46:12,910
I took the anger on her
that I've on you.

1017
01:46:13,400 --> 01:46:16,074
You got it, right?
I'll do anything for you.

1018
01:46:16,269 --> 01:46:20,183
I'm giving you a day's time, be ready.

1019
01:46:20,640 --> 01:46:22,745
If not you too would meet the same end.

1020
01:46:25,545 --> 01:46:26,990
If you go to police...

1021
01:47:05,852 --> 01:47:09,527
There's no use in fearing him.

1022
01:47:10,490 --> 01:47:13,767
Come, let's meet Commissioner directly

1023
01:47:23,437 --> 01:47:25,917
Did Gopi come home, Madhu?
- No.

1024
01:47:26,106 --> 01:47:30,248
It seems few goons came to his school
and took him away in a car.

1025
01:47:35,115 --> 01:47:36,753
Famhemnothing has happened to you, right?

1026
01:47:36,950 --> 01:47:38,725
Why? What happened?

1027
01:47:38,919 --> 01:47:43,197
My husband got a call that you'd
an heart attack, he came here.

1028
01:47:43,390 --> 01:47:45,233
Didn't he come here, father?
- No, dear.

1029
01:47:45,425 --> 01:47:48,304
Oh my God!
My son is also missing.

1030
01:47:57,137 --> 01:47:59,413
Oh no, my hubby!

1031
01:48:03,443 --> 01:48:04,649
Please stop...

1032
01:48:27,567 --> 01:48:31,014
If you step out to lodge complaint,
you're in trouble.

1033
01:48:32,372 --> 01:48:35,842
If you enter police station,
you'll lose your sister's son.

1034
01:48:37,077 --> 01:48:39,717
When you lodge complain,
you'll lose your brother:

1035
01:48:39,913 --> 01:48:45,056
No...please forgive me, Sasi.

1036
01:48:45,418 --> 01:48:48,194
Your life got ruined in trying
to save my life

1037
01:48:48,388 --> 01:48:50,231
I will not come to police station.

1038
01:48:50,423 --> 01:48:51,401
I will not come

1039
01:48:58,431 --> 01:49:00,104
What are you saying?

1040
01:49:00,767 --> 01:49:05,409
Please forget everything that
happened here as bad dream.

1041
01:49:06,973 --> 01:49:08,145
Please forget it.

1042
01:49:08,341 --> 01:49:11,049
Are you a woman?

1043
01:49:11,244 --> 01:49:13,952
If you were in my place,
what would you've done?

1044
01:49:14,147 --> 01:49:17,651
Please try to understand my situation

1045
01:49:17,851 --> 01:49:22,960
If I try to help you now,
my entire family would get destroyed.

1046
01:49:32,933 --> 01:49:34,071
This is right way to say!

1047
01:49:34,935 --> 01:49:36,243
For your selfishness!

1048
01:49:36,670 --> 01:49:40,584
You don't care about other's life but you
and your family must be fine, right?

1049
01:49:44,144 --> 01:49:45,646
These are not my words.

1050
01:49:45,845 --> 01:49:47,415
I'm repeating what you told me that day!

1051
01:49:50,884 --> 01:49:54,730
When I gave witness against your brother,
I was in similar situation.

1052
01:49:55,322 --> 01:49:57,734
But I was coward from your side.

1053
01:49:58,224 --> 01:49:59,066
I was selfish.

1054
01:49:59,893 --> 01:50:01,304
But what about you now?

1055
01:50:04,631 --> 01:50:09,774
My parents and my sisters were
surrounded by 40 goons

1056
01:50:10,370 --> 01:50:13,442
A situation came to take weapons.

1057
01:50:14,074 --> 01:50:14,916
But my father...

1058
01:50:15,108 --> 01:50:16,416
Take it son...take it.

1059
01:50:16,610 --> 01:50:20,387
If you tell truth to save your friend,

1060
01:50:20,580 --> 01:50:24,118
those goons will ruin your sisters
and their lives.

1061
01:50:24,317 --> 01:50:27,230
Better to kill us all before that happens.

1062
01:50:28,288 --> 01:50:31,895
Entire family's future depends
on the decision you take today.

1063
01:50:32,092 --> 01:50:36,404
That day I was just another ordinary man.

1064
01:50:37,530 --> 01:50:40,636
I feared of everyone, I was too scared.

1065
01:50:41,267 --> 01:50:42,405
I had sentiments.

1066
01:50:42,936 --> 01:50:43,880
I made a mistake.

1067
01:50:44,604 --> 01:50:47,585
But you punished me with this!

1068
01:50:48,742 --> 01:50:51,518
Today, you've committed the same mistake.

1069
01:50:52,045 --> 01:50:54,423
Tell me, what punishment do you deserve?

1070
01:50:54,681 --> 01:50:55,523
What punishment should I give you?

1071
01:50:57,283 --> 01:51:00,628
Till now I chased you,
I threatened and forced you to love me.

1072
01:51:01,521 --> 01:51:03,057
To tell you this truth.

1073
01:51:05,125 --> 01:51:09,232
Till now you won and I lost.

1074
01:51:09,696 --> 01:51:14,543
But today you lost and
this victory is enough for me.

1075
01:51:16,803 --> 01:51:20,080
Hereafter I'll not trouble you anymore

1076
01:51:20,874 --> 01:51:22,444
I did all this to teach you a lesson.

1077
01:51:23,276 --> 01:51:24,380
Don't think I'm mad.

1078
01:51:25,111 --> 01:51:27,717
There's a son of happiness
in this madness

1079
01:51:28,848 --> 01:51:32,625
Hereafter we pan our ways!

1080
01:51:33,887 --> 01:51:35,889
I'll never show my face again to you.

1081
01:51:36,423 --> 01:51:37,834
You too don't show your face to me

1082
01:51:44,898 --> 01:51:46,502
Whatever he said is true, Madhuri.

1083
01:51:47,100 --> 01:51:50,775
Experiences change a man's opinion.

1084
01:51:51,337 --> 01:51:56,685
There will be a situation for anyone's
cowardice or terrorizing others.

1085
01:51:56,876 --> 01:52:00,380
People who fail to understand
the situation may feel it as injustice.

1086
01:52:03,183 --> 01:52:04,856
You're thinking about me.

1087
01:52:05,885 --> 01:52:09,389
What you imagine is not true, Madhuri.

1088
01:52:09,923 --> 01:52:12,733
What happened in that room
was something else..

1089
01:52:41,921 --> 01:52:43,229
What you thought was different...

1090
01:52:53,133 --> 01:52:56,410
He's not a bad man as you think

1091
01:52:56,770 --> 01:53:04,313
Nobody is born criminal,
situations turn a man into bad ways.

1092
01:53:04,511 --> 01:53:06,548
Hatred can't win over bad.

1093
01:53:06,946 --> 01:53:10,723
Forgiveness and love can win this world.

1094
01:53:11,184 --> 01:53:12,822
As a woman I'm telling you

1095
01:53:13,019 --> 01:53:16,523
A woman's important character
is forgivenessmlove.

1096
01:53:17,390 --> 01:53:20,234
Try to understand this Madhuri.

1097
01:53:20,426 --> 01:53:26,069
Go and see the condition of
his family for your acts.

1098
01:53:58,431 --> 01:54:01,742
O rose...

1099
01:54:09,475 --> 01:54:15,824
You oozed honey of love"

1100
01:54:16,015 --> 01:54:21,988
ls itjustice to ruin a life
with your thorns?

1101
01:55:01,127 --> 01:55:06,372
Vtflth hatred in heart,
you aimed the arrow of love...

1102
01:55:06,566 --> 01:55:11,538
For the song of vengeance"
for the sheer force of it...

1103
01:55:11,738 --> 01:55:16,915
In the guise of innocence
with poisonous thoughts...

1104
01:55:17,110 --> 01:55:22,560
ls a girl myth for the word beauty?

1105
01:55:22,749 --> 01:55:25,252
Where's the beauty in
the world with women?

1106
01:55:25,451 --> 01:55:27,727
What made you so nasty?

1107
01:55:27,921 --> 01:55:32,893
Forgive...forgive everything
that had happened...

1108
01:56:46,799 --> 01:56:52,112
For a hurt heart...
for broken dreams...

1109
01:56:52,305 --> 01:56:57,254
Show affection...
accept your love...

1110
01:56:57,443 --> 01:57:02,722
Accept your love for once"

1111
01:57:02,915 --> 01:57:08,365
If love forget you,
you're a lost woman...

1112
01:57:08,554 --> 01:57:13,902
What's in your heart?

1113
01:58:04,577 --> 01:58:06,989
Sathya, I want to talk to you.

1114
01:58:08,214 --> 01:58:10,421
I want to talk to you.

1115
01:58:26,032 --> 01:58:28,638
Look...look at this!

1116
01:58:29,135 --> 01:58:31,843
Have a good look!

1117
01:58:33,439 --> 01:58:38,047
Samhya killed Oil Raj believing
that dog's words.

1118
01:58:38,778 --> 01:58:40,655
He ripped out my stomach

1119
01:58:45,017 --> 01:58:47,156
I took it in my stride.

1120
01:58:48,221 --> 01:58:52,431
If I was not alert for a second,
Sathya would've killed me that day.

1121
01:58:53,126 --> 01:58:56,403
He's more my enemy than you.

1122
01:58:56,629 --> 01:58:58,768
Yes, you must finish him

1123
01:58:58,965 --> 01:59:03,345
We can't touch Sathya till he's with Rai.

1124
01:59:03,536 --> 01:59:05,880
Plan something and separate them.

1125
01:59:06,372 --> 01:59:07,009
How?

1126
01:59:17,150 --> 01:59:20,097
What? Is he betraying me?

1127
01:59:20,286 --> 01:59:22,732
Yes, whatever it may be
we goons of Bangalore are same

1128
01:59:22,922 --> 01:59:25,198
He's shelling out everything earned
in oil business on that girl.

1129
01:59:25,391 --> 01:59:29,237
He's itching to marry her.

1130
01:59:29,428 --> 01:59:31,499
He's planning to finish you
after uniting with her.

1131
01:59:31,697 --> 01:59:33,768
This is what Kutty had written to Sathya.

1132
01:59:37,370 --> 01:59:38,644
Do you believe me now?

1133
01:59:39,805 --> 01:59:41,182
Where can I find Sathya now?

1134
02:02:17,430 --> 02:02:19,740
Sathya...take it!

1135
02:03:11,417 --> 02:03:12,327
Come Sathya!

1136
02:03:23,529 --> 02:03:24,735
Who attacked them?

1137
02:03:24,930 --> 02:03:26,841
Chief priest's son Sathya.

1138
02:03:27,032 --> 02:03:29,512
Is that goon priest's son?

1139
02:03:30,569 --> 02:03:32,776
What a sin has been committed, God!

1140
02:03:32,972 --> 02:03:35,213
Wham a son you have, Shastry!

1141
02:03:35,408 --> 02:03:39,550
You offered vermilion and flowers to God
but you consecrated it with blood now.

1142
02:03:41,080 --> 02:03:44,653
Respect, honour, prestige
of this temple is ruined.

1143
02:03:45,451 --> 02:03:47,124
Who will visit this temple now?

1144
02:03:47,319 --> 02:03:50,425
Entire town knows your son is a goon.

1145
02:03:52,224 --> 02:03:53,828
Shastry, this is murder case.

1146
02:03:54,026 --> 02:03:56,563
Your son...
- He's not my son, sir.

1147
02:03:56,762 --> 02:03:57,763
He's not my son.

1148
02:03:57,963 --> 02:04:00,102
My son is dead longtime ago.

1149
02:04:00,299 --> 02:04:03,473
If you say your son is dead,
would this town accept this?

1150
02:04:04,103 --> 02:04:06,743
Yes, though he's bad man,
he's your son.

1151
02:04:07,339 --> 02:04:10,548
You're trying to get your daughter married
to my son with a son like him!

1152
02:04:10,743 --> 02:04:12,051
Aren't you ashamed of it?

1153
02:04:12,845 --> 02:04:14,722
If his son is such a goon,
how would his daughter be?

1154
02:04:14,914 --> 02:04:15,517
Come, let's go.

1155
02:04:15,915 --> 02:04:16,586
Enough of it, come

1156
02:04:16,782 --> 02:04:18,386
Enough of them,
no need of their proposal.

1157
02:04:26,759 --> 02:04:29,467
If I had such a son, I would've conducted
his obsequies while he's still alive

1158
02:04:55,087 --> 02:04:56,657
Father... no...

1159
02:04:57,089 --> 02:04:57,931
Don't do it, father...

1160
02:04:58,123 --> 02:04:59,033
Where are you going, Samhya?

1161
02:04:59,225 --> 02:05:01,068
Look...look there!

1162
02:05:01,327 --> 02:05:03,773
I'm alive and he's conducting my obsequies

1163
02:05:06,432 --> 02:05:09,470
Though I was not with them,
I was still their son.

1164
02:05:09,668 --> 02:05:11,875
Now they're removing me from their lives

1165
02:05:12,404 --> 02:05:14,577
How much they would've
got hurt because of me?

1166
02:05:14,773 --> 02:05:16,753
Leave me, I must fall at his feet
and seek his forgiveness.

1167
02:05:16,909 --> 02:05:18,149
Leave me.

1168
02:05:18,744 --> 02:05:21,384
Police are waiting to arrest you
- Leave me, let them arrest me.

1169
02:05:21,580 --> 02:05:22,752
Leave me..leave me...

1170
02:05:22,948 --> 02:05:25,258
Leave me.
- I can't leave you.

1171
02:05:26,252 --> 02:05:29,790
I'll kill you
- Kill me..kill me"

1172
02:05:29,989 --> 02:05:32,060
Kill me!

1173
02:05:32,258 --> 02:05:33,100
Kill me!

1174
02:05:33,292 --> 02:05:37,069
I'm sinner...kill me.

1175
02:05:37,530 --> 02:05:40,443
You're not a sinner, I'm sinner.

1176
02:05:40,766 --> 02:05:41,836
I'm sinner.

1177
02:05:42,801 --> 02:05:46,840
I sacrificed my life for love
and selfishness.

1178
02:05:47,306 --> 02:05:49,343
Am I son of that great man?

1179
02:05:50,109 --> 02:05:54,387
God...my sisters' lives are ruined
because of me.

1180
02:05:54,847 --> 02:05:56,258
My father lost his honour.

1181
02:05:57,550 --> 02:05:58,620
In that temple"

1182
02:06:02,922 --> 02:06:06,631
Had I not picked weapon that day,
I would've been dead by now.

1183
02:06:06,859 --> 02:06:08,395
I wouldn't be here to see this.

1184
02:06:09,495 --> 02:06:12,271
But today he's offering obsequies as I watch

1185
02:06:13,666 --> 02:06:16,078
Father...father...

1186
02:06:17,937 --> 02:06:21,851
How was l...what am I now...

1187
02:06:22,241 --> 02:06:23,515
How am I now...

1188
02:06:24,343 --> 02:06:28,223
No...no...there's no one for me
in this world.

1189
02:06:28,414 --> 02:06:29,893
No one!

1190
02:06:31,817 --> 02:06:33,160
I'm there for you.

1191
02:06:33,752 --> 02:06:38,758
I shattered your life with
the cyclone I creamed.

1192
02:06:38,958 --> 02:06:42,405
I was responsible for this.

1193
02:06:42,995 --> 02:06:46,169
Samhya, there's no one for me
other than you.

1194
02:06:46,365 --> 02:06:47,571
No one else.

1195
02:06:48,300 --> 02:06:52,077
I must see the old Sathya...
I want my old Sathya again.

1196
02:06:52,638 --> 02:06:56,450
Sathya, you must become your old self again.

1197
02:06:56,642 --> 02:06:57,916
You must get out of this rut.

1198
02:06:58,110 --> 02:06:59,145
You must come out.

1199
02:07:00,412 --> 02:07:03,757
The world will not spare
a good man like you.

1200
02:07:03,916 --> 02:07:08,160
The men with whom you were
working tried to kill you.

1201
02:07:08,354 --> 02:07:13,064
Rai, the man for whom you work
is behind this murderous attack.

1202
02:07:15,928 --> 02:07:23,574
When I went for you, I heard Rai and
Dheena's brother talking to each other

1203
02:07:26,872 --> 02:07:31,412
No need of friendship with these bad men.

1204
02:07:31,844 --> 02:07:36,054
Let's go far away from here...
live happily.

1205
02:07:36,582 --> 02:07:38,061
Let's work hard to make a living.

1206
02:07:46,859 --> 02:07:49,237
How many times I've to tell you
not to come after me?

1207
02:07:49,561 --> 02:07:51,939
How many times I've to tell you?
I don't love you.

1208
02:07:52,131 --> 02:07:54,907
Go, marry a good man and live happily.

1209
02:07:55,100 --> 02:07:56,841
If you come after me again...

1210
02:08:52,758 --> 02:08:56,069
No...Samhya_..no...

1211
02:08:57,930 --> 02:08:58,908
No Sathyam.

1212

02:09:39,438 --> 02:09:41,008
Why did you come here?
Do you've any sense?

1214
02:09:48,080 --> 02:09:49,718
Is it the situation to talk about that?

1215
02:10:13,205 --> 02:10:14,081
No, Sathya!

1216
02:10:22,247 --> 02:10:25,091
“My are you hesitating
hiding something in heart?

1217
02:10:25,617 --> 02:10:27,619
Why do you lie that you don't love me?

1218
02:10:29,054 --> 02:10:34,936
If you don't love me,
why do you get tensed if I get hurt?

1219
02:10:35,861 --> 02:10:37,602
This is not love but humanity.

1220
02:10:37,796 --> 02:10:38,968
Humanity!

1221
02:10:39,765 --> 02:10:43,178
Look at him!
How brutally you've hit him!

1222
02:10:44,169 --> 02:10:45,773
Didn't you feel that humanity on him?

1223
02:10:46,738 --> 02:10:49,776
Do you've to do that drama
to teach me a lesson?

1224
02:10:49,908 --> 02:10:53,185
No, you loved me earlier
and you still love me.

1225
02:10:53,712 --> 02:10:55,885
Tell me truth, don't you love me, Sathya?

1226
02:10:56,081 --> 02:10:56,957
Tell me the truth!

1227
02:11:09,161 --> 02:11:10,731
Where are you taking me?

1228
02:11:15,200 --> 02:11:16,406
Greetings brother:

1229
02:11:17,536 --> 02:11:19,413
Look at her carefully...

1230
02:11:19,872 --> 02:11:21,249
Do you want to be like her?

1231
02:11:28,614 --> 02:11:31,390
Do you know who she is?
\Mfe of a notorious goon.

1232
02:11:31,683 --> 02:11:36,063
He loved and married her.
I killed him with my hands.

1233
02:11:37,389 --> 02:11:38,732
Do you also wish to be like her?

1234
02:11:39,591 --> 02:11:40,194
Tell me

1235
02:11:40,759 --> 02:11:41,931
Do you also wish to be like her?

1236
02:11:42,127 --> 02:11:44,733
So, quit this life of violence
- Quit?

1237
02:11:44,930 --> 02:11:46,409
Wham am I to quit? My life?

1238
02:11:46,665 --> 02:11:50,408
Riding a tiger, for good or bad,
need to keep on riding it.

1239
02:11:50,602 --> 02:11:52,513
If I get down from it,
tiger may eat me.

1240
02:11:52,838 --> 02:11:55,910
You've seen everything,
picking a weapon has lead to this violence.

1241
02:11:56,108 --> 02:11:59,419
I'll be nothing if I give up weapon.

1242
02:12:03,882 --> 02:12:07,386
My love for you hasn't gone down a bit.

1243
02:12:10,856 --> 02:12:15,828
That's why I say marry someone else
and live happily.

1244
02:12:16,028 --> 02:12:18,736
I don't want you to end up like her.

1245
02:12:19,331 --> 02:12:22,904
Society will not accept Samhya
as good man again.

1246
02:12:23,101 --> 02:12:24,808
Don't want you to become
good man for society

1247
02:12:25,003 --> 02:12:26,038
Become good man for my sake

1248
02:12:26,238 --> 02:12:28,013
If not for your sake only!

1249
02:12:28,206 --> 02:12:29,310
It's easier said than done.

1250
02:12:29,508 --> 02:12:31,954
Please listen to me,
marry someone else...

1251
02:12:32,144 --> 02:12:34,715
Commissioner has ordered
to round up all goons,

1252
02:12:34,913 --> 02:12:36,551

1253
02:12:47,726 --> 02:12:49,672
Please come in,
you've come like an angel now.

1254
02:12:49,861 --> 02:12:50,839
What's the matter, sir?

1255
02:12:51,196 --> 02:12:53,073
Look, what she's up to!

1256
02:12:53,332 --> 02:12:55,573
She has stopped eating for 3 days now.

1257
02:12:55,767 --> 02:12:57,747
I'm forcing her to eat but
she's refusing to have anything

1258
02:12:57,936 --> 02:12:58,744
'NW?

1259
02:12:58,937 --> 02:13:00,211
She's fasting for Sathya refusing
to turn a new leaf for her.

1260
02:13:03,408 --> 02:13:05,285
Please advice her.

1261
02:13:17,756 --> 02:13:18,632
What's this?

1262
02:13:20,759 --> 02:13:25,401
Calm down..

1263
02:13:30,802 --> 02:13:32,076
Tell me, what's the matter?

1264
02:13:32,804 --> 02:13:37,719
I made a mistake and
his life got ruined, Sasi.

1265
02:13:38,076 --> 02:13:39,282
Let bygones be bygones,

1266
02:13:39,911 --> 02:13:42,824
would everything be fine if you fast?

1267
02:13:43,015 --> 02:13:45,552
I don't want everything to be fine.

1268
02:13:45,751 --> 02:13:47,856
Itis enough if he alone turns good.

1269
02:13:48,553 --> 02:13:53,901
How can I be happy when his life
is hanging between life and death?

1270
02:13:54,393 --> 02:13:59,069
I want the old Samhya..
I want him.

1271
02:13:59,431 --> 02:14:01,069
I must see that old Samhya.

1272
02:14:01,933 --> 02:14:03,776
What? Wham are you saying?

1273
02:14:03,969 --> 02:14:07,246
Either she must or I must die
to end this problem

1274
02:14:07,439 --> 02:14:10,886
Tell her that I don't care
even if she dies

1275
02:14:11,243 --> 02:14:13,382
Tell her I don't care.

1276
02:14:13,945 --> 02:14:18,291
You want me to say like that or
are you really careless about her?

1277
02:14:19,451 --> 02:14:20,930
Tell her I really don't care about her.

1278
02:14:21,086 --> 02:14:23,066
Sathya, Kutty is out ofjail.

1279
02:14:24,256 --> 02:14:26,395
Kutty has come out ofjail.

1280
02:14:28,660 --> 02:14:32,767
Dheena isn't just your brother,
he's my brother too.

1281
02:14:33,098 --> 02:14:36,079
Tell Ponnan that I've a plan ready
to eliminate Sathya.

1282
02:14:36,268 --> 02:14:37,975
Okay, brother:
- Bye, brother:

1283
02:14:40,105 --> 02:14:41,243
Market is yours.

02:14:41,440 --> 02:14:45,479
Kutty, you've to finish Sathya
as early as possible.

1285
02:15:07,265 --> 02:15:08,767
Where is she?
- In her room

1286
02:15:16,541 --> 02:15:20,751
Hey you! Are you playing fun with me?

1287
02:15:22,247 --> 02:15:25,660
You did everything to me,
are you planning to kill by blackmailing me?

1288
02:15:26,818 --> 02:15:29,298
This sentiment will not work on me.

1289
02:15:29,721 --> 02:15:30,825
I'll not fall for this.

1290
02:15:39,598 --> 02:15:41,839
Come on...eat...eat...

1291
02:15:42,033 --> 02:15:42,875

1294
02:15:46,404 --> 02:15:47,007
I said eat!

1295
02:15:47,539 --> 02:15:49,177
If you don't eat, I'll cut you.

1296
02:15:50,909 --> 02:16:00,660
You can win anything with it but not love!

1297
02:16:03,655 --> 02:16:06,761
Why don't you try to understand me?

1298
02:16:07,259 --> 02:16:09,865
It's over...please listen to me

1299
02:16:10,195 --> 02:16:11,003
Please eat.

1300
02:16:12,864 --> 02:16:14,172
VWII you give up violence?

1301
02:16:14,366 --> 02:16:16,812
Brother, Kutty has attacked us.

1302
02:16:19,671 --> 02:16:21,173
Look, how he has bashed him!

1303
02:16:25,076 --> 02:16:28,057
Samhya, listen to me...

1304
02:16:33,151 --> 02:16:33,993
Brother...

1305

Wham happened?

1306
02:16:53,438 --> 02:16:56,544
Kutty's men attacked me.

1307
02:16:56,775 --> 02:16:57,651
Don't spare him.

1308
02:16:58,176 --> 02:17:03,649
You've to take revenge,
do something, plan something.

1309
02:17:21,399 --> 02:17:23,106
Mum? Did they kill Kutty?

1310
02:17:23,301 --> 02:17:24,575
They killed him in bar, brother:

1311
02:17:24,769 --> 02:17:26,180
They shred him to pieces.

1312
02:17:30,075 --> 02:17:31,611
Did he kill Sathya?

1313
02:17:31,776 --> 02:17:34,552
He killed Kutty for asking extra
commission in oil business.

1314
02:17:34,746 --> 02:17:37,955
He wants to become king of underworld,
you're his next target.

1315
02:17:38,149 --> 02:17:40,493
He's enjoying with that girl.

1316
02:17:40,685 --> 02:17:42,255
If we catch her, we can get him.

1317
02:17:56,067 --> 02:17:59,981
Wham? ls Madhu in hospital?
-Yes no time to think.

Her life is in your hands.
Come, let's go to hospital immediately.

02:18:53,525 --> 02:18:57,268
Doctor said she's dehydrated completely

1320
02:18:57,462 --> 02:18:59,942
She's not agreeing to have
saline water too.

1321
02:19:00,131 --> 02:19:01,974
You've to do something.

1322
02:19:07,305 --> 02:19:10,411
Look, I'm Samhya here.

1323
02:19:10,742 --> 02:19:12,619
Look at me, Madhu.

1324
02:19:27,926 --> 02:19:30,634
Madhu, don't be adamant.

What's the climax, brother?

1332
02:21:18,837 --> 02:21:19,679
What's the ending of the story?

1333

Wham happened, brother?

1334
02:21:21,539 --> 02:21:23,177
The last pages are missing.

1335
02:21:23,374 --> 02:21:25,411
How can I tell without reading it?
Somebody has torn the pages

1336
02:21:25,610 --> 02:21:27,283
Come, let's ask that girl.

1337
02:21:27,479 --> 02:21:29,049
Come

There's no ending in this
Tell me what's the ending?

1349
02:21:56,674 --> 02:22:00,417
I tore off the last pages.
- Why?

1350
02:22:00,612 --> 02:22:03,957
It's not enough if you read
what had happened to Samhya!

You've to see that with your eyes

Give us poison, we'll have it.

1357

'NW?

1358
02:22:37,682 --> 02:22:40,356
Viflthout telling the climax of this story,
you're going on dragging it.

1359
02:22:40,552 --> 02:22:42,896
I'll tell you, that's why I brought you here.

1360
02:22:43,087 --> 02:22:44,225
Why did you bring us here?

1361
02:22:44,422 --> 02:22:45,594
I'll tell you that also.

1362
02:22:45,790 --> 02:22:46,860
Give me that book.

1365
02:23:48,252 --> 02:23:50,823
I promise on you,
I'm giving up life of violence.

1366
02:24:15,246 --> 02:24:16,884
Leave him..leave him...

1367
02:24:17,749 --> 02:24:21,253

1368
02:24:23,688 --> 02:24:25,497

Don't stop them...come...come..

1371

He says he's giving up life of violence.

1375
02:24:48,413 --> 02:24:49,391
Come, let's go.

1376
02:25:04,696 --> 02:25:07,905
That day love won over hatred

1377
02:25:08,099 --> 02:25:09,874
Peace won over violence.

1378
02:25:10,068 --> 02:25:14,915
Had he picked a weapon that day;
he didn't have a chance to live.

1379
02:25:15,406 --> 02:25:18,250
But he didn't do it.

1380
02:25:18,643 --> 02:25:21,624
Where is he now?

1381
02:25:23,081 --> 02:25:23,855
Look there!

1382
02:25:42,366 --> 02:25:43,970
How are you Samhya?
- Look at me!

1383
02:25:44,168 --> 02:25:46,307
I'm in seventh heaven with my angel!

1384
02:25:46,938 --> 02:25:47,746
Is it your kid?

1385
02:25:47,939 --> 02:25:49,850
Yes, not one kid only, he too!

1386
02:25:50,007 --> 02:25:51,987
Hey kiddo!

1387
02:25:52,677 --> 02:25:54,748
Are you fine, Sasi?
- I'm fine.

1388
02:25:54,946 --> 02:25:56,050
Are you fine?

1389
02:25:57,248 --> 02:25:59,489
Nasty food! Serve good food, man!

1390
02:26:00,752 --> 02:26:02,390
Please sit down...

1391
02:26:04,188 --> 02:26:05,166
I'll be back in a minute

1392
02:26:09,994 --> 02:26:10,734
What happened, sir?

1393
02:26:10,928 --> 02:26:14,637
Mother f..., the food is worth for dogs only,
I can't pay for it.

1394
02:26:15,199 --> 02:26:17,338
Look, you're here with hunger.

1395
02:26:17,535 --> 02:26:20,072
If you don't have money,
tell me openly, I'll offer you free food.

1396
02:26:20,271 --> 02:26:23,013
But you used a bad word mother f...

1397
02:26:23,207 --> 02:26:24,242
Look there!

1398
02:26:28,846 --> 02:26:29,824
She's my mother!

1399
02:26:31,682 --> 02:26:33,389
Your mother would look like her, right?

1400
02:26:33,751 --> 02:26:35,424
Now use that swearing word again

1401
02:26:39,690 --> 02:26:42,261
I made a mistake, brother:
Please forgive me

1402
02:26:42,426 --> 02:26:43,496
I'll never use such words again.

1403
02:26:44,262 --> 02:26:44,865
Serve him food.

1404
02:26:48,699 --> 02:26:51,612
Did you see? How he was and
what he has become!

1405
02:26:55,373 --> 02:26:58,877
He may have lost his leg
and become handicapped.

1406
02:26:59,243 --> 02:27:02,383
But he's very healthy mentally!

1407
02:27:08,286 --> 02:27:11,893
You may go around in cars!
You may have fame!

1408
02:27:12,290 --> 02:27:17,069
Tell me, how many hours
can you sleep peacefully?

1409
02:27:29,273 --> 02:27:31,651
Right, what you said is true, Sasi.

1410
02:27:32,610 --> 02:27:36,057
Instead of living with hundreds
of enemies without peace,

1411
02:27:36,981 --> 02:27:41,157
it's better to live at least for a day
with wife and kids happily!

1412
02:27:48,593 --> 02:27:52,973
Yes I'm fed up with this
13 years of violent life

1413
02:27:53,431 --> 02:27:55,843
Court, law, lawyer, police!

1414
02:27:56,033 --> 02:27:57,171
Fed up with it.

1415
02:27:57,368 --> 02:28:00,838
I'll live peacefully and happily
with my parents.

1416
02:28:06,310 --> 02:28:10,622
We'll never again touch this weapon again
