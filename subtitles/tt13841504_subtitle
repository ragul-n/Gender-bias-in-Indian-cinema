Sir, you are not allowed to enter inside.

00:02:54,497 --> 00:02:57,931
In a way how courageous we would be
when our loved ones are beside us,

4
00:02:59,056 --> 00:03:01,602
similarly, we'd be very
terrified when they are in danger.

00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:09,253
We'll remember our initial days only when
we are about to witness the final moments.

Have you arrived, sir?

00:04:42,232 --> 00:04:43,735
Are you having food? Be on it.

8
00:04:44,053 --> 00:04:46,445
After having food, just roam
around the town in a carefree manner.

9
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:49,086
I'll cook and keep the food ready.
Just come and have it again.

Have you ever looked at
your face in the mirror?

11

You seem like a murderer.

12
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:56,976
I've been eagerly
waiting that you'd reform.

13
00:04:57,256 --> 00:04:58,990
But you are just sinking low day by day.

14
00:04:59,413 --> 00:05:00,417
On one side, I've been scolding you.

15
00:05:00,683 --> 00:05:02,366
And how come you are still
able to eat food shamelessly?

left us is doing good in heaven.

seeking permission, I'll break your legs.

00:05:27,944 --> 00:05:30,997
Since he resembles you,
you have named him 'Rajkumar'.

23
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:33,660
But look at him,
he has turned out like a rowdy.

booze with a sweet song in the background?

Hey! Do you know the connection
between the old wine and Megastar's trend?

31
00:06:34,915 --> 00:06:36,210
Both are addictions!

00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,327
Anyhow, why should he be
tensed about the programme?

I doubt that he has passed out somewhere.

He's been not answering the calls as well.

00:06:44,398 --> 00:06:45,420
I wonder where he has
passed out in inebriation.

don't live on our terms.

Be it in the office or the

Nevertheless, I am an unmarried girl.

126

So I have to think to such an extent.

127

I know how much you are going through.

128
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:18,642
At the time when I told that I'd marry
you, my father was there for my family.

129

Now, I am there for them.

130
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:23,580
And the day when my family believes
that my little brother is there for them,

131
00:14:23,842 --> 00:14:24,930
I'll happily marry you and take you home.

132
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:26,549

forever for falling in love with you.

is in your room, where should I get ready?

sister was in her place,

174
00:19:13,773 --> 00:19:15,019
she'd complain about it to my mother,

175
00:19:15,858 --> 00:19:17,260
my mother would complain to me,

176
00:19:18,042 --> 00:19:20,136
and I would come for you.
To avoid that process,

177
00:19:21,777 --> 00:19:23,898
I came now to warn
you once and for all.

178
00:19:27,589 --> 00:19:28,493
Sorry, bro.

179
00:19:35,384 --> 00:19:39,345
-Bro... Well, who is your sister?
-Hey! You fool!

180
00:19:40,723 --> 00:19:42,874
Bro, we'll know about her
on our own. Please carry on.

181
00:19:43,507 --> 00:19:44,300
What's with you, idiot?

182
00:19:50,301 --> 00:19:52,602
I should somehow get the
work done with the help of Pune.

183
00:19:53,045 --> 00:19:54,032
Sir, I've been waiting for you.

184
00:19:54,385 --> 00:19:55,316
Well... What is your task?

185
00:19:55,603 --> 00:19:56,802
I need a death certificate.

186
00:19:57,173 --> 00:19:58,350
For your father or mother?

187
00:19:58,962 --> 00:20:01,362
I want it on my name
to claim the insurance.

188
00:20:02,491 --> 00:20:04,231
It costs around 50,000 rupees
as it is an expensive crime.

189
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:05,584
50,000 rupees?

190
00:20:06,129 --> 00:20:07,196
Won't there be any discount?

191
00:20:07,536 --> 00:20:09,193
Well, I'll issue the certificate to all
your family members at free of cost.

192
00:20:09,485 --> 00:20:10,269
But I'll put my name as the nominee

193
00:20:10,528 --> 00:20:11,768
and receive all the
amount. It'll be good riddance.

194
00:20:12,037 --> 00:20:13,134
-Please, look into this.
-Go away!

195
00:20:13,849 --> 00:20:14,777
Greetings, brother.

196
00:20:16,751 --> 00:20:17,824
-Sir, please.
-Hey... Just leave.

197
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,925
-Is my brother inside?
-Just a moment. I'll check and inform.

198
00:20:24,704 --> 00:20:26,107
-Make sure to finish it quickly.
-I'll handle it.

199
00:20:26,807 --> 00:20:27,350
-Sir.
-Okay.

200
00:20:27,614 --> 00:20:28,635
Your brother is downstairs.

201
00:20:29,427 --> 00:20:31,278
-I am busy. Tell him to wait.
-Okay, sir.

202
00:20:36,255 --> 00:20:38,125
He said he was busy
and asked you to wait.

203
00:20:38,567 --> 00:20:39,471
He told me to wait?

204
00:20:55,317 --> 00:20:57,630
He is still here! He
will bust me if he sees.

205
00:20:58,338 --> 00:20:59,099
[snaps]

206
00:21:00,478 --> 00:21:01,313
How much longer
should I have to wait?

207
00:21:01,548 --> 00:21:02,459
I'll inform him.

208
00:21:07,684 --> 00:21:09,647
Sir, your little brother is still
waiting over there. Should I send him in?

209
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:10,956
Tell him I'm busy.

210
00:21:11,259 --> 00:21:13,288
Look, he is playing on his
phone but cites being busy!

211
00:21:15,754 --> 00:21:18,093
Bro, he asked you to
wait for a little longer.

212
00:21:19,472 --> 00:21:20,551
Oh man!

213
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:22,290
Damn it!

214
00:21:42,943 --> 00:21:44,468
Bro, I'll inform him one more time.

215
00:21:45,494 --> 00:21:47,151
Not needed. Out of my way!

216
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,849
How dare you make me wait for
two hours despite being free?

217
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:00,730
Well... Did you get angry?

218
00:22:02,747 --> 00:22:04,630
I've been waiting for two
years for your reformation.

219
00:22:06,132 --> 00:22:07,051
Imagine how much angry should I get?

220
00:22:07,938 --> 00:22:08,911
Anyhow, why are you here?

221
00:22:09,404 --> 00:22:10,611
I need some money urgently.

222
00:22:12,815 --> 00:22:15,244
You might have a brother to ask
for money whenever you need.

223
00:22:16,239 --> 00:22:18,458
But I can't afford to
fulfil your every need.

224
00:22:20,389 --> 00:22:22,206
-Are you saying that you won't give money?
-I am saying that I don't have money.

225
00:22:23,244 --> 00:22:24,318
And even if I had money,
I won't give it to you.

226
00:22:33,257 --> 00:22:35,548
[glass shatters]

227
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,613
Look Ajay.

228
00:22:43,813 --> 00:22:45,643
Sometimes, we have to
take the responsibility

229
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:47,517
for the mistakes which we didn't do.

230
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:48,902
Sir, the thing is that...

231
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:53,536
The reason I called you is not about
punishing you or hearing your explanation.

232
00:22:53,981 --> 00:22:55,882
Chiding and punishing
won't bring any change in him.

233
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:58,723
When they realise their responsibility
on their own, then they would change.

234
00:22:59,021 --> 00:22:59,945
So, you do one thing.

235
00:23:00,461 --> 00:23:03,877
Tomorrow, take your little brother to this
place. Say my name and he will be hired.

236
00:23:04,177 --> 00:23:05,350
Let's see if there would be any
change in him at least after that.

237
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:06,797
Okay?

238
00:23:09,017 --> 00:23:09,762
Thank you, sir.

239
00:23:33,091 --> 00:23:34,509
-Wow!
-Superb, dude!

240
00:23:37,025 --> 00:23:40,428
Whichever tune you present at any
place, it would become a big hit.

241
00:23:42,247 --> 00:23:44,315
There is an unknown magic inside you.

242
00:23:46,984 --> 00:23:49,195
Instead of wasting your
time by spending with us...

243
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:52,489
I have a friend who works for
a music company in Mumbai.

244
00:23:52,964 --> 00:23:55,806
If you go and meet him,
your future would become very bright.

245
00:23:58,922 --> 00:23:59,691
Hey buddy...

246
00:24:00,403 --> 00:24:01,133
-Hey...
-Hey...

247
00:24:02,291 --> 00:24:05,151
You evade this kind of talks all
the time. What does that mean?

248
00:24:05,823 --> 00:24:07,324
This time you have to go there for sure.

249
00:24:07,583 --> 00:24:08,701
You go there if you like it.

250
00:24:09,901 --> 00:24:10,693
-Hey...
-Hey...

251
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:12,487
What's with him?

252
00:24:27,273 --> 00:24:29,278
Why do you get so angry? Hmm?

253
00:24:29,931 --> 00:24:31,596
Dhora was telling you for your well being.

254
00:24:32,436 --> 00:24:34,035
Just go there for one
time and give it a try.

255
00:24:34,822 --> 00:24:37,487
If that appeals to you,
you'll lead a happy life.

256
00:24:39,906 --> 00:24:44,102
If I go there by listening to you
guys, I might have a happy life.

257
00:24:45,424 --> 00:24:46,997
But I can't live on my own terms.

258
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:52,898
How can I be happy by staying away
from you guys who seek my well-being?

259
00:24:54,311 --> 00:24:59,213
Whatever it may be,
if Dhora is fine, I'll be fine.

260
00:25:00,088 --> 00:25:02,506
And I will be living in
the town wherever Dhora is.

261
00:25:06,815 --> 00:25:08,387
Don't you ever discuss
this topic with me again.

262
00:25:08,656 --> 00:25:10,298
Raj... Raj...

263
00:25:19,006 --> 00:25:21,091
[temple bell rings]

264
00:25:31,269 --> 00:25:32,028
-Hey...
-Yes.

265
00:25:32,311 --> 00:25:33,743
Instead of standing
outside the temple all the time,

266
00:25:33,984 --> 00:25:36,152
why don't you step inside once?

267
00:25:36,895 --> 00:25:38,835
It is not possible for me to
enter into a temple, in this birth.

268
00:25:39,564 --> 00:25:40,620
Let's think about it in my next life.

269
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:41,675
Alright. It is upto you.

270
00:25:54,673 --> 00:25:55,478
Sasi.

271
00:27:09,782 --> 00:27:12,070
Hey...

272
00:27:13,328 --> 00:27:14,847
Raju, what's the matter?

273
00:27:16,332 --> 00:27:17,894
Didn't you tell me that you wouldn't
enter any temple in this life?

274
00:27:19,211 --> 00:27:19,767
Huh?

275
00:27:21,292 --> 00:27:23,836
Why are you looking there while
the deity is on this side?

276
00:27:24,036 --> 00:27:26,343
Nothing. You carry on,
Dhora. I'll be right back.

277
00:27:28,106 --> 00:27:29,021
Hmm...

278
00:27:39,684 --> 00:27:40,541
Damn!

279
00:27:45,786 --> 00:27:49,298
Instead of having a sulky and pouty
expression on your face all the time,

280
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,059
why don't you talk to me with a smile?

281
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:56,692
Anyhow, that's not where you should be.

282
00:27:57,829 --> 00:27:58,579
Over there!

283
00:28:09,009 --> 00:28:10,057
Now, it is perfect.

284
00:28:14,102 --> 00:28:15,441
You have sent him with me to my
college despite my resistance.

285
00:28:16,666 --> 00:28:19,560
He has bashed some guy over there
and I've been suspended for 10 days.

286
00:28:20,545 --> 00:28:21,317
Calm down.

287
00:28:24,219 --> 00:28:25,573
Why are you dull? What happened?

288
00:28:25,773 --> 00:28:27,564
Moreover, the food on
your plate is unmoved.

289
00:28:28,364 --> 00:28:29,718
Raj came to my office
in the morning, mother.

290
00:28:32,081 --> 00:28:33,439
Ask him to be ready tomorrow morning.

291
00:28:34,307 --> 00:28:35,454
I am going to place in a job.

292
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:36,988
Why don't you tell him yourself?

293
00:28:40,975 --> 00:28:42,643
He is not in a position to listen to me.

294
00:28:44,051 --> 00:28:46,070
It's not that I am pained or
feeling him as a burden, mother.

295
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:48,190
It is all about making him
realise the responsibility.

296
00:28:48,713 --> 00:28:49,346
Tsk!

297
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,412
You tell him in the way
he understands, mother.

298
00:28:57,115 --> 00:28:59,333
Son, have at least some food.

299
00:29:20,581 --> 00:29:21,855
[door opens]

300
00:29:25,108 --> 00:29:27,808
Seems like it's been so late.
Haven't you gone to sleep yet?

301
00:29:29,399 --> 00:29:35,091
I don't fall asleep due to the trigger
of time or by tiredness of my body.

302
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,270
See, we have a heart...

303
00:29:41,225 --> 00:29:44,146
We'd be able to catch
sleep only when it is at peace.

304
00:29:44,505 --> 00:29:45,630
What happened now?

305
00:29:47,115 --> 00:29:50,045
Hey... Come here. Sit down.

306
00:29:54,768 --> 00:29:55,897
How you used to be?

307
00:29:57,142 --> 00:29:59,637
You used to look like a groomed prince.

308
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:03,889
See now. The sight of your
beard, your behaviour...

309
00:30:04,985 --> 00:30:09,780
It's been so many days that
I have seen you in a happy mood.

310
00:30:11,088 --> 00:30:13,817
I am unable to bear the
sight of you in this position.

311
00:30:15,852 --> 00:30:18,490
Your brother... Poor him!

312
00:30:18,945 --> 00:30:19,923
He is solely...

313
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,888
He is solely carrying the
responsibility of this entire family.

314
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:30,698
I feel very pity for him!

315
00:30:32,381 --> 00:30:32,965
Hey...

316
00:30:33,891 --> 00:30:38,323
I, you and your sister are
dependent on his sole salary.

317
00:30:38,817 --> 00:30:40,321
Did you ever realise it?

318
00:30:41,027 --> 00:30:43,049
He didn't even get married.

319
00:30:43,784 --> 00:30:45,128
Did you ever think about it?

320
00:30:46,259 --> 00:30:47,985
Do you even understand anything?

321
00:30:51,566 --> 00:30:57,398
Well, he said that he
has found a job for you.

322
00:30:59,302 --> 00:31:00,396
You are my loving son.

323
00:31:00,634 --> 00:31:04,427
Son, please wake up early
in the morning and be ready.

324
00:31:04,665 --> 00:31:06,146
He said he will drop you.

325
00:31:06,455 --> 00:31:08,634
Son, go and sleep early.

326
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,839
-Okay?
-Okay, mother.

327
00:31:14,138 --> 00:31:14,903
Okay...

335
00:31:41,862 --> 00:31:42,519
What?

336
00:31:42,986 --> 00:31:43,806
Are you still not ready?

337
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:45,234
Where to?

338
00:31:45,458 --> 00:31:47,928
What? Mother has informed you, right?

339
00:31:48,747 --> 00:31:49,593
About what?

340
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:52,531
I explained everything to you
last night, and you question about it?

341
00:31:53,835 --> 00:31:56,729
Tsk! I don't remember what you said
and have no energy now, to listen to you.

-Brother...

Hey... Hey... Listen to me.

00:32:06,628 --> 00:32:09,464
Everyone is watching us.

346
00:32:11,297 --> 00:32:12,626
Ajay, what is this?

347
00:32:12,826 --> 00:32:15,155
-Everyone is watching you.
-There is nothing new to witness!

348
00:32:15,463 --> 00:32:17,139
-He has already ransacked our reputation.
-Hey!

349
00:32:26,934 --> 00:32:28,488
Why are you staring like a
scarecrow? Shave his beard!

350
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:32,538
-[trimmer whirring]
-Hmph! Don't you understand my words!

351
00:32:32,811 --> 00:32:34,106
-Hey Raj...
-Ajay!

352
00:32:34,439 --> 00:32:35,318
I will change for no one.

353
00:32:35,917 --> 00:32:36,885
I'll be in my own terms.

354
00:32:37,085 --> 00:32:38,519
He's been telling you for
your well being, right?

355
00:32:39,632 --> 00:32:41,314
Why don't you get your beard shaved?

356
00:33:07,973 --> 00:33:08,721
Hey...

357
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:11,140
Hey, stop!

358
00:33:22,574 --> 00:33:23,100
Damn it!

359
00:33:25,377 --> 00:33:25,968
[carrom coins clatter]

360
00:33:26,948 --> 00:33:28,295
-Nice shot!
-Superb!

361
00:33:28,657 --> 00:33:29,707
I've been playing only because you have
placed a full bottle of booze as the bet.

362
00:33:29,982 --> 00:33:30,625
Don't cheat.

363
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:33,121
Who is cheating? Tell us, Dhora.

364
00:33:33,593 --> 00:33:34,862
-Just play your game.
-You'd support him...

365
00:33:35,144 --> 00:33:36,694
-...all the time deliberately.
-Just play your game, dude!

366
00:33:39,932 --> 00:33:41,009
Wait... There is excess powder.

367
00:33:48,176 --> 00:33:48,802
Your turn.

368
00:33:50,366 --> 00:33:52,106
Hey, give the striker to me.

369
00:33:56,518 --> 00:33:57,400
[groans]

370
00:33:57,748 --> 00:34:00,074
Oh no! Hey, what happened?

371
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,654
What are these bruises?

372
00:34:01,911 --> 00:34:03,210
-Bruises?
-There's blood.

373
00:34:04,211 --> 00:34:05,998
-Hey, get the first aid box.
-Hey, get the first aid box.

374
00:34:06,267 --> 00:34:06,902
What happened?

375
00:34:07,195 --> 00:34:08,103
It's just a bike skid.

376
00:34:20,723 --> 00:34:23,847
You claim it is nothing.
But see how big your injury is.

377
00:34:24,842 --> 00:34:26,772
Why don't you drive carefully?

378
00:34:29,424 --> 00:34:30,250
Hey!

379
00:34:31,076 --> 00:34:32,324
Why are you going overboard?

380
00:34:33,022 --> 00:34:35,718
-Don't you irritate me!
-Hey... Hey... Hey...

381
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:37,565
-Buddy...
-Hey, where are you going?

382
00:34:41,633 --> 00:34:42,954
Don't feel bad, dear.

383
00:34:43,432 --> 00:34:44,814
You know very well about
his anger, don't you?

384
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:48,160
I am feeling bad not
because he has scolded me.

385
00:34:49,029 --> 00:34:51,578
It is because of his injuries.

386
00:35:25,114 --> 00:35:27,470
Autorickshaw... Autorickshaw...

387
00:35:44,197 --> 00:35:45,532
-Hi, madam.
-[gasps]

388
00:35:49,214 --> 00:35:53,442
If she falls in love with me,
I will give her whatever she wants.

389
00:35:53,643 --> 00:35:54,975
There is no need of marriage too.

390
00:35:56,973 --> 00:35:57,491
Hey!

391
00:36:01,443 --> 00:36:03,100
You need not have to perform
with everyone at once.

392
00:36:03,374 --> 00:36:04,518
Love one by one.

393
00:36:04,814 --> 00:36:07,854
There wouldn't be a joy if the
occasion comes every day, right?

394
00:36:09,646 --> 00:36:11,306
-Hey! Why are you silent?
-Mwah!

395
00:36:11,527 --> 00:36:13,813
-Whom are you going to treat among us?
-Damn!

396
00:36:14,606 --> 00:36:15,958
Hey, wait!

397
00:36:16,226 --> 00:36:17,813
Hey, stop!

398
00:36:18,319 --> 00:36:21,377
[footsteps arriving]

399
00:36:57,376 --> 00:36:57,777
Hey!

00:36:58,245 --> 00:36:58,741
Hey!

401
00:37:09,494 --> 00:37:10,200
Hey!

00:37:11,438 --> 00:37:12,153
[groans]

403
00:38:12,911 --> 00:38:13,627
Sister-in-law.

404
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:20,782
Don't share this matter with brother.

405
00:38:33,622 --> 00:38:34,677
Stay happy.

406
00:38:42,918 --> 00:38:44,629
She will now take money from you.

407
00:38:48,619 --> 00:38:49,023
Is that okay?

408
00:38:49,302 --> 00:38:50,380
-Thanks, brother.
-Why did you give her so much?

409
00:38:51,946 --> 00:38:53,997
Poor guy! All the
responsibilities are on his shoulder.

410
00:38:54,328 --> 00:38:55,684
-Shall I take it?
-Yeah...

411
00:38:55,892 --> 00:38:56,836
Hey!
Hold on.

412
00:38:57,058 --> 00:38:58,343
See, he has come.
Tie it to him.

413
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,588
He is very busy that you can't
find him once he goes out.

414
00:39:00,877 --> 00:39:02,428
I don't have another Rakhi to tie him.

415
00:39:02,647 --> 00:39:04,717
What do you mean?
He is your brother, right?

416
00:39:04,995 --> 00:39:05,991
Didn't you bring one for him?

417
00:39:06,208 --> 00:39:08,337
A sister ties the Rakhi to her
brother so that he'll take care of her.

418
00:39:08,646 --> 00:39:10,926
It will be disgusting if
he becomes a problem.

419
00:39:11,221 --> 00:39:12,073
I will not tie to him.

420
00:39:12,427 --> 00:39:14,110
What did he do?
It's his problem...

421
00:39:19,736 --> 00:39:20,936
Dad,
I'm leaving to office.

422
00:39:21,617 --> 00:39:22,542
Wait a moment, dear.

423
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,710
You might have a great
heart being my daughter,

424
00:39:29,561 --> 00:39:33,014
to handle the responsibilities considering
love as marriage but,

425
00:39:33,973 --> 00:39:35,509
I'm very sad about not getting you married

426
00:39:36,003 --> 00:39:39,141
even so many years
after accepting your love.

427
00:39:40,177 --> 00:39:42,824
I'm getting late, dad. Bye.

428
00:39:49,535 --> 00:39:50,152
Hi.

429
00:39:51,037 --> 00:39:52,710
Hey!
How come you are here?

430
00:39:52,977 --> 00:39:53,953
Is Raj brother home?

431
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:54,782
Why?

432
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:56,557
To tie the Rakhi.

433
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:57,706
To him?

434
00:39:57,906 --> 00:39:59,414
Why are you shocked?

435
00:40:00,101 --> 00:40:03,956
[sighs] You are unaware because you
are staying at home out of suspension.

436
00:40:04,303 --> 00:40:06,469
You would have known your stature
if you had come to the college.

437
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:10,373
Everyone is scared to look
at girls in the college.

438
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:14,481
Do you know what happened
at the college on that day?

439
00:40:15,512 --> 00:40:17,268
-Hey girl!
-Hey, come here.

440
00:40:17,585 --> 00:40:19,818
Hey, you!
Come this way.

441
00:40:24,631 --> 00:40:26,694
Are you ****?

442
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:29,016
Yes, sir. I'm a first-year
student from the mechanical branch.

443
00:40:29,436 --> 00:40:33,281
I didn't ask your branch.

444
00:40:34,144 --> 00:40:37,291
I'm asking you whether
you are **** or not?

445
00:40:38,997 --> 00:40:43,062
Dude, she mightn't be aware
of the count as she is silent.

446
00:40:44,342 --> 00:40:45,184
Well said!

447
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,946
Hey!
Why are you leaving without answering?

448
00:40:52,702 --> 00:40:53,936
[no audio]

449
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:06,432
I know several brothers who would react
only after their sisters face a problem.

450
00:41:06,784 --> 00:41:12,429
But your brother is the only guy who
reacted anticipating his sister's problem.

451
00:41:13,004 --> 00:41:16,036
Which is why I came to tie
Rakhi to such a brother.

452
00:41:19,167 --> 00:41:23,448
[dialer tone]
The number you are trying...

453

[gate creaks]

454
00:41:32,931 --> 00:41:35,476
-Hey dude!
-Hey! For how long should I wait?

455
00:41:35,748 --> 00:41:36,765
Why are you disconnecting my call?

456
00:41:37,046 --> 00:41:38,347
This is the festival of Raksha Bandhan.

457
00:41:38,757 --> 00:41:40,116
It will come once in a year.

458
00:41:40,513 --> 00:41:44,516
And a brother's life is unworthy if he
doesn't make his sister tie him a Rakhi.

459
00:41:45,301 --> 00:41:47,647
-Here is the sweet.
-No thanks. Have it yourself.

460
00:41:48,085 --> 00:41:48,702
Come.

461
00:42:20,876 --> 00:42:22,799
Hey!
Why are you playing on the road?

462
00:42:23,522 --> 00:42:25,872
Come, dear. Sorry, dear.
Don't mind.

463
00:42:26,564 --> 00:42:27,356
Come.

the festival of my heart?"

you have offered to me"

wings and fell into the heart"

if you are unaware of it"

only after seeing you"

00:49:00,778 --> 00:49:02,862
Do you think we'll keep quiet
if you indulge in hooliganism?

520
00:49:03,099 --> 00:49:03,883
Come to the station.

521
00:49:04,136 --> 00:49:05,262
Sir, we didn't fight.

522
00:49:05,557 --> 00:49:07,682
My friend hit them as
they were teasing her.

523
00:49:08,144 --> 00:49:09,465
Is he saying the truth?

524
00:49:11,312 --> 00:49:12,092
I'm asking you.

525
00:49:12,854 --> 00:49:14,875
We are nowhere related to this brawl.

526
00:49:17,201 --> 00:49:17,876
Let's go, dear.

527
00:49:18,792 --> 00:49:20,068
Ah...
it's not that, sir...

528
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,424
Enough of your stories!
Come to the station.

529
00:49:23,915 --> 00:49:25,234
-Come.
-Why did they frame us, dude!

530
00:49:34,421 --> 00:49:36,177
This case might be involved with money.

531
00:49:36,669 --> 00:49:38,629
I want the complete
details before the evening.

532
00:49:39,224 --> 00:49:41,065
-Okay?
-You loved a great girl indeed!

533
00:49:41,742 --> 00:49:43,513
It's fine that she didn't care
you while you were following her.

534
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:45,811
But how come she got you in the
police station without the courtesy...

535
00:49:46,011 --> 00:49:48,017
...of fighting for her?
Damn!

536
00:49:48,627 --> 00:49:49,557
To hell with the love!

537
00:49:53,536 --> 00:49:54,076
Hey!

538
00:49:54,850 --> 00:49:55,888
Hey, S.I. is here.

539
00:49:57,211 --> 00:50:00,043
Does your father own the market
that you've damaged it so badly?

540
00:50:00,554 --> 00:50:02,724
-Sir, they were teasing a girl...
-Shut up!

541
00:50:03,643 --> 00:50:05,548
Do you guys even look like
those who rescue girls?

542
00:50:06,021 --> 00:50:07,004
-Hey 102!
-Sir.

543
00:50:07,313 --> 00:50:08,214
Lock them up and file the case.

544
00:50:08,504 --> 00:50:09,833
-Sir...
-Who are you?

545
00:50:10,092 --> 00:50:10,938
They are my boys.

546
00:50:11,642 --> 00:50:13,107
There might've been some mistake.

547
00:50:13,341 --> 00:50:14,375
They aren't such boys, sir.

548
00:50:14,607 --> 00:50:15,582
Kindly leave them.

549
00:50:18,815 --> 00:50:20,141
I'm leaving you as he is requesting.

550
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:23,611
If I ever see you involving in any brawl,
I'll imprison you.

551
00:50:23,870 --> 00:50:24,359
Thank you, sir.

552
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:25,279
-Hey 402!
-Sir.

553
00:50:25,568 --> 00:50:26,919
-Take their details and leave them.
-Okay, sir.

554
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:28,334
-Go!
-Thank you, sir.

555
00:50:30,895 --> 00:50:32,922
Hey...!
What's this?

556
00:50:33,198 --> 00:50:34,007
What's the brawl about?

557
00:50:34,313 --> 00:50:35,626
This is all because of that girl, Dhora.

558
00:50:35,842 --> 00:50:36,546
Which girl are you talking about?

559
00:50:37,829 --> 00:50:40,744
Hey!
Why is he leaving so angrily? Let's go.

560
00:51:12,756 --> 00:51:15,159
Who the hell are you to slap my daughter?

561
00:51:16,441 --> 00:51:18,134
Why?
Did it enrage you?

562
00:51:18,542 --> 00:51:20,383
I too got tenfold anger than this.

563
00:51:21,770 --> 00:51:24,162
As she's been not paying any heed to
me despite following her all these days.

564
00:51:26,192 --> 00:51:29,924
She is acting like a stranger
despite knowing me.

565
00:51:33,366 --> 00:51:35,812
I reacted as you were in problem.

566
00:51:36,030 --> 00:51:36,796
-Have you gone crazy...
-Hey!

567
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:37,633
...that you aren't reacting yet!

568
00:51:37,858 --> 00:51:40,180
I plead you to leave!
Can't you understand?

569
00:51:40,634 --> 00:51:41,650
Get out of here!

570
00:51:42,221 --> 00:51:43,746
Why should I...?
Huh?

571
00:51:44,021 --> 00:51:45,907
-I'm talking to her, right?
-Hey, wait.

572
00:51:46,216 --> 00:51:48,507
Instead of arguing amongst
yourselves blindly,

573
00:51:48,781 --> 00:51:50,666
why don't you ask you
daughter to know the truth?

574
00:51:50,959 --> 00:51:52,458
The girl is right here.
Ask her to explain.

575
00:51:52,705 --> 00:51:53,589
Hold on!

576
00:51:54,896 --> 00:51:57,113
We've been hiding our personal matter
amongst ourselves for all these days,

577
00:51:57,386 --> 00:51:59,107
but you made them public today.

578
00:52:00,926 --> 00:52:04,157
This is a society that talks ill
about a girl who is not beautiful.

579
00:52:04,632 --> 00:52:08,121
Imagine the reaction when
a girl has a defect!

580
00:52:11,765 --> 00:52:14,139
She might feel the pain of your slap,

581
00:52:15,177 --> 00:52:17,344
but she is in a position where
she couldn't understand...

582
00:52:17,589 --> 00:52:19,153
...why you slapped her
and why we are crying.

583
00:52:21,519 --> 00:52:23,964
Generally, parents wish to get
their young daughters married

584
00:52:24,690 --> 00:52:27,109
and happily send them
to their in-laws' house.

585
00:52:28,555 --> 00:52:30,613
But we'd have a feeling
of skipping a heartbeat,

586
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:32,288
when we don't see her
even for a minute.

587
00:52:37,025 --> 00:52:40,314
She doesn't know anything other
than asking for food when hungry

588
00:52:40,598 --> 00:52:41,861
and to laugh when she is happy.

589
00:52:44,723 --> 00:52:47,207
And you are thinking that she's
not saying a word after all this.

590
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:53,478
She is in a position where
she cannot say anything.

591
00:52:57,458 --> 00:53:00,871
Even kids get matured as they grew.

592
00:53:01,289 --> 00:53:02,459
And they will understand everything.

593
00:53:05,052 --> 00:53:09,815
But my daughter cannot understand
what's happening and never will.

594
00:53:15,986 --> 00:53:16,592
That's why,

595
00:53:18,416 --> 00:53:22,353
she is still a kid to us despite her age.

596
00:53:24,491 --> 00:53:26,607
I'm folding my hands
and pleading you...

597
00:53:27,715 --> 00:53:29,067
...kindly leave this place.

598
00:53:30,816 --> 00:53:35,639
Regardless of the reason, please forgive
us for the mistake that had happened.

599
00:53:39,041 --> 00:53:39,691
Let's go.

600
00:53:43,461 --> 00:53:49,410
[thundering]

601
00:54:07,538 --> 00:54:09,400
Hey!
Don't take it to heart.

602
00:54:11,269 --> 00:54:13,407
Generally one would think
how beautiful a girl is,

603
00:54:14,303 --> 00:54:16,155
rather than looking into her problems.

604
00:54:18,548 --> 00:54:21,232
You liked her without knowing
about her condition. Leave it.

605
00:54:21,488 --> 00:54:23,524
Falling in love with a girl for her beauty

606
00:54:24,071 --> 00:54:26,466
and abandoning her
after knowing her problems...

607
00:54:27,576 --> 00:54:29,247
How is it even regarded as love, Dhora?

608
00:54:29,644 --> 00:54:31,906
I was behind her not
because she is beautiful,

609
00:54:33,984 --> 00:54:36,463
but it was out of joy about
finding my life again.

610
00:54:38,998 --> 00:54:40,210
She is not a stranger, Dhora.

611
00:54:42,666 --> 00:54:44,919
She is the girl I have been in love with,
two years ago.

612
00:55:06,070 --> 00:55:07,352
What are you saying?

613
00:55:08,777 --> 00:55:10,348
Do you know her before?

614
00:55:13,696 --> 00:55:14,516
Tell us.

615
00:55:18,017 --> 00:55:18,855
Yes, Dhora.

616
00:55:20,036 --> 00:55:23,455
Not just me... Even Sasi
knows her very well.

617
00:55:23,705 --> 00:55:29,597
-Sasi too?
-In unison: Sasi...

618
00:55:33,319 --> 00:55:35,433
You should gulp down the entire
beer at once. Are you ready?

619
00:55:36,175 --> 00:55:38,738
One... Two... Three...

620
00:55:38,938 --> 00:55:44,812
[indistinct voices]

621
00:55:55,655 --> 00:55:57,942
Sasi...

622
00:56:00,359 --> 00:56:05,221
[chaos]

623
00:56:15,469 --> 00:56:16,181
Hey, Sasi!

624
00:56:18,630 --> 00:56:20,334
Hey, stop!

625
00:56:20,876 --> 00:56:21,550
Just stop!

626
00:56:21,970 --> 00:56:24,079
Let's go.
Move!

627
00:56:25,555 --> 00:56:26,397
Hey Sasi!

628
00:56:26,884 --> 00:56:28,738
Are you scared that you are running away?

629
00:56:31,636 --> 00:56:32,458
Hey...

630
00:56:56,256 --> 00:57:00,395
[whistling]
Run... Run...

631
00:57:04,730 --> 00:57:08,795
Sons, how dare you booze and
make a fuss in this sacred hostel!

632
00:57:09,061 --> 00:57:10,885
Sons? I am your only son, aren't I?

633
00:57:11,085 --> 00:57:11,620
Oh almighty!

634
00:57:11,886 --> 00:57:16,374
Why have you presented me with a profane
son while I've asked for a revered one?

635
00:57:16,574 --> 00:57:17,930
What can God do about
what you have done?

636
00:57:18,543 --> 00:57:19,799
Jesus!

637
00:57:20,330 --> 00:57:22,181
Well, why did you get into a quarrel?

638
00:57:22,417 --> 00:57:24,346
Sasi was the one who started it.

639
00:57:24,568 --> 00:57:25,449
Who the hell started it first?

640
00:57:25,724 --> 00:57:26,219
Hey!

641
00:57:26,453 --> 00:57:28,432
-How dare you push the blame on me!
-Let go of him!

642
00:57:28,647 --> 00:57:30,257
-Jesus!
-[indistinct voices]

643
00:57:30,579 --> 00:57:32,416
I am your warden standing here!

644
00:57:32,670 --> 00:57:35,833
Sasi, the entire college
knows that you'd booze.

645
00:57:36,724 --> 00:57:39,008
I even know that both of you would
become allies when something happens.

646
00:57:39,338 --> 00:57:41,257
This should see an end!

647
00:57:41,553 --> 00:57:42,624
Amen!

648
00:57:43,234 --> 00:57:45,096
Vacate the hostel!

649
00:58:05,079 --> 00:58:06,925
Why did you send them away when
these guys were the ones who boozed?

650
00:58:07,125 --> 00:58:07,976
Hey...

651
00:58:12,369 --> 00:58:13,805
The person who I asked to leave was Sasi.

652
00:58:15,547 --> 00:58:18,146
Didn't you say that both of us would join
become allies when something happens?

653
00:58:18,443 --> 00:58:19,158
Let's go.

654
00:58:19,719 --> 00:58:22,551
I know that you
wouldn't listen to me.

655
00:58:22,751 --> 00:58:23,692
So, I have summoned his father.

656
00:58:23,962 --> 00:58:25,736
Now, you will be having
the clobbering time.

657
00:58:25,942 --> 00:58:28,360
[imitating percussions]

658
00:58:35,267 --> 00:58:37,144
Hello, sir.
Good morning.

659
00:58:38,057 --> 00:58:40,354
At least now, you have accomplished the
thing which I couldn't do all these days.

660
00:58:40,744 --> 00:58:45,468
I have told them long ago to
vacate this hostel so that we can enjoy.

661
00:58:45,778 --> 00:58:47,120
But they have never listened to me, sir.

662
00:58:47,344 --> 00:58:49,903
I will take care of them, sir.

663
00:58:57,643 --> 00:58:59,267
[grunting]

664
00:58:59,769 --> 00:59:00,354
Satisfied!

665
00:59:01,956 --> 00:59:03,145
Cool! Cool!

666
00:59:13,495 --> 00:59:17,311
Hey, why are you wearing a mask as
if you are here to abduct? Remove it.

667
00:59:17,527 --> 00:59:18,148
Not at all!

668
00:59:18,426 --> 00:59:20,144
Removing it will hamper my
skin colour and glamour.

669
00:59:20,414 --> 00:59:21,828
-I won't remove it at all.
-Alright.

670
00:59:22,085 --> 00:59:23,520
-Please maintain a little distance from me
-Sure.

671
00:59:25,248 --> 00:59:26,634
Hi!
Hi... Hi.

672
00:59:27,875 --> 00:59:29,951
Something got stuck to your face?

673
00:59:30,768 --> 00:59:32,016
Is it the beauty that
has stuck to my face?

674
00:59:32,894 --> 00:59:35,125
Chubby cheeks, dimple chins!

675
00:59:35,325 --> 00:59:36,660
[phone ringing]

676
00:59:38,009 --> 00:59:40,273
Where the hell are you guys despite
being my friends? Today is my marriage.

677
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:43,096
Ah! Surprise gift?
[door knocking]

678
00:59:43,534 --> 00:59:44,339
You have sent it?

679
00:59:44,603 --> 00:59:47,429
Seems like it has arrived.
I will call you upon unwrapping the gift.

680
00:59:47,629 --> 00:59:49,681
[laughing enthusiastically]

681
00:59:52,599 --> 00:59:53,885
-Hi. Are you a courier girl?
-Hi.

682
00:59:54,085 --> 00:59:55,477
Wow!
Where is the gift?

683
00:59:55,687 --> 00:59:56,768
-I am the gift.
-[gasps]

684
00:59:57,891 --> 00:59:59,531
-You are my gift?
-Yes.

685
01:00:00,195 --> 01:00:02,172
My friends are too much crazy!

686
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:04,569
Madam, this is a wrong timing.

687
01:00:04,818 --> 01:00:05,830
-My body and heart
-Is it?

688
01:00:06,094 --> 01:00:07,340
are dedicated to my wife.

689
01:00:07,623 --> 01:00:09,381
Oh man!
Don't tempt me. Ah!

690
01:00:10,597 --> 01:00:11,678
Well, let's come to an agreement.

691
01:00:11,962 --> 01:00:13,358
-Only one kiss.
-Okay. Your wish.

692
01:00:13,788 --> 01:00:14,525
Okay.

693
01:00:20,857 --> 01:00:22,451
-How come he is so heavy?
-Why is he so heavy?

694
01:00:22,709 --> 01:00:24,044
-He is slipping! Bloody idiot!
-Hold him properly.

695
01:00:24,295 --> 01:00:25,713
-Come... Come...
-Someone might notice us.

696
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:27,355
-Sorry... Sorry...
-Wow! Burqas.

697
01:00:27,613 --> 01:00:28,554
Hold him properly. This way.

698
01:00:28,831 --> 01:00:30,024
Seems like this is a good concept.

699
01:00:30,399 --> 01:00:32,529
There would be a reduction in costume's
cost and it covers the entire body.

700
01:00:32,806 --> 01:00:33,639
My skin colour would be safe.

701
01:00:33,929 --> 01:00:35,422
Hello, excuse me. Hello...

702
01:00:35,630 --> 01:00:37,444
-Hello... Hello, ladies.
-Why is he following us?

703
01:00:37,997 --> 01:00:39,595
-Make him sit here. Let's take him later.
-You girls go.

704
01:00:40,194 --> 01:00:41,684
Make it fast. He might arrive.

705
01:00:49,463 --> 01:00:52,903
Hello, madam. I am very interested
in dresses similar to burqas.

706
01:00:53,130 --> 01:00:55,102
I am a bit more conscious
when it comes to tan.

707
01:00:55,566 --> 01:00:56,700
Actually, where did you...

708
01:00:59,481 --> 01:01:01,537
Am I so handsome that you fell
on me for merely scratching you?

709
01:01:01,773 --> 01:01:03,356
I wasted a lot of nails as
I didn't know this concept!

710
01:01:03,580 --> 01:01:05,632
But this is a wedding. It won't seem
good if someone sees us in this position.

711
01:01:11,350 --> 01:01:13,494
Come on, you are making
me uncomfortable. Mwah!

712
01:01:14,154 --> 01:01:15,315
You seem you won't be
leaving me unless I something.

713
01:01:15,515 --> 01:01:17,259
Okay. Let's start with a kiss.

714
01:01:18,052 --> 01:01:18,738
Slowly.

715
01:01:19,928 --> 01:01:20,984
[screams in shock]

716
01:01:22,343 --> 01:01:23,404
What the hell is wrong with you, sir?

717
01:01:24,738 --> 01:01:26,879
Sir... Sir...

718
01:01:27,291 --> 01:01:27,739
Ow!

719
01:01:28,566 --> 01:01:29,593
Come... Make it quickly.

720
01:01:30,869 --> 01:01:32,485
-What are you studying, son?
-Medicine, uncle.

721
01:01:32,726 --> 01:01:33,788
-Where are you studying?
-In America.

722
01:01:33,988 --> 01:01:35,408
-Oh, you studied medicine in America!
-Come.

723
01:01:35,705 --> 01:01:37,093
It is a great achievement.

724
01:01:37,380 --> 01:01:38,601
Oh! Who are you girls?

725
01:01:38,853 --> 01:01:39,678
-Greetings, uncle.
-Oh no!

726
01:01:39,911 --> 01:01:41,244
-Hold...
-What happened?

727
01:01:41,444 --> 01:01:42,310
She fainted and fell down.

728
01:01:42,539 --> 01:01:43,593
-We are taking her to the hospital.
-Hospital?

729
01:01:43,863 --> 01:01:45,237
-He is a doctor. He'll check her.
-Yes, I will.

730
01:01:45,506 --> 01:01:46,217
Go, check her.

731
01:01:46,634 --> 01:01:47,320
Come on.

732
01:01:48,553 --> 01:01:49,144
-Uncle
-Yes.

733
01:01:49,346 --> 01:01:50,167
She is pregnant.

734
01:01:50,372 --> 01:01:51,449
-You mean...
-Yes.

735
01:01:51,722 --> 01:01:53,228
She's been waiting for that
to happen for a long time.

736
01:01:53,510 --> 01:01:54,552
We'll take her to the hospital, uncle.

737
01:01:54,850 --> 01:01:56,385
-Take her carefully. Careful.
-Okay, uncle.

738
01:01:56,585 --> 01:01:58,370
-Go... Go...
-Come on, girls. Make it quick.

739
01:01:58,833 --> 01:01:59,842
-Hey
-Yes, uncle.

740
01:02:00,106 --> 01:02:03,542
You held her hand and told that she was
pregnant. You've become a fine doctor!

741
01:02:03,793 --> 01:02:04,370
-Yes.
-See you, sir.

742
01:02:19,834 --> 01:02:20,762
-Uncle
-Yes.

743
01:02:21,302 --> 01:02:23,031
-What is it?
-The groom is missing.

744
01:02:23,287 --> 01:02:24,097
Missing?

745
01:02:24,542 --> 01:02:26,291
Oh, they are taking away groom!

746
01:02:30,471 --> 01:02:32,515
-Hey, someone is following us. Look.
-What?

747
01:02:33,020 --> 01:02:34,957
-Hey...
-Oh no!

748
01:02:36,396 --> 01:02:38,946
Oh man, why is he
chasing us? Drive faster.

749
01:02:40,074 --> 01:02:40,733
Come on, faster.

750
01:02:41,022 --> 01:02:41,631
Idiot!

751
01:02:49,296 --> 01:02:50,958
Who are you? Why have you kidnapped me?

752
01:02:51,256 --> 01:02:52,328
My father has no money.

753
01:02:52,546 --> 01:02:54,435
-He is a poor artist.
-Hey, stop it!

754
01:02:55,181 --> 01:02:56,051
[whistling]

755
01:02:56,646 --> 01:02:58,243
Why have you whistled? Who is arriving?

756
01:02:58,493 --> 01:02:59,165
Look.

757
01:02:59,918 --> 01:03:03,131
Ah!
Fatima Bulbul, is this all your doing?

758
01:03:03,394 --> 01:03:05,484
That's not the point.
Why do you get so angry?

759
01:03:05,743 --> 01:03:07,930
I can't live without you.

760
01:03:08,138 --> 01:03:10,380
If I marry you, my life
will get ruined. Drat!

761
01:03:10,738 --> 01:03:12,974
My father threatened to
kill me if I marry you.

762
01:03:13,340 --> 01:03:16,812
I thought it is better to live than
die. So, I have sacrificed you.

763
01:03:17,063 --> 01:03:20,204
You too think broadly and
marry some Akbar or Azharuddin,

764
01:03:20,488 --> 01:03:23,092
have a cute kid with him
and name him after me.

765
01:03:23,339 --> 01:03:24,555
What more can I wish
for you other than this?

766
01:03:24,777 --> 01:03:27,057
-Listen to me once.
-I said no. Just no!

767
01:03:27,282 --> 01:03:29,474
Hey, what are you talking? Huh?

768
01:03:29,788 --> 01:03:31,663
You've been crying till now
because he was getting married.

769
01:03:31,870 --> 01:03:34,066
We took a big risk to bring him here.
And now, why are you requesting him?

770
01:03:34,424 --> 01:03:36,147
Like the spectator getting the
pain rather than the actual player,

771
01:03:36,431 --> 01:03:38,223
why the hell are you involving in this,
fair girl? Just mind your business.

772
01:03:38,673 --> 01:03:40,118
-Oh no! Dear...
-Get off, rascal!

773
01:03:40,401 --> 01:03:41,332
Of course, I would have the pain.

774
01:03:41,647 --> 01:03:44,169
Because only friends can
empathise the pain of the lovers.

775
01:03:44,931 --> 01:03:47,177
People like you chase after girls.

776
01:03:47,471 --> 01:03:48,891
And pamper them by giving
everything without even being asked.

777
01:03:49,194 --> 01:03:51,854
You'd behave as if the
girl is your only world.

778
01:03:52,132 --> 01:03:54,411
Imagine our state after you have abandoned
us while we have left our parents

779
01:03:54,685 --> 01:03:57,131
for the sake of love you
have showered upon us.

780
01:03:57,494 --> 01:03:59,165
What about her situation now?

781
01:03:59,506 --> 01:04:01,788
We don't want that to happen.
So we have brought you here.

782
01:04:02,049 --> 01:04:03,722
Come, go and tie the knot.

783
01:04:03,976 --> 01:04:06,661
No, I won't.
Do whatever the hell you want!

784
01:04:07,592 --> 01:04:08,832
-Give me that thing.
-Yeah, give that to her.

785
01:04:10,110 --> 01:04:10,521
-[gasps]
-Oh no!

786
01:04:10,806 --> 01:04:11,703
-Tell me now.
-Don't do that, Sasi!

787
01:04:11,903 --> 01:04:12,803
Come on, please accept me.

788
01:04:13,091 --> 01:04:15,089
Hey, what's with you.
You've come here to help, haven't you?

789
01:04:15,314 --> 01:04:16,320
Then, why are you staring
like that as if...

790
01:04:16,596 --> 01:04:18,516
you are staring at a heroine's poster
at the traffic signal? Come on, help me.

792
01:04:29,658 --> 01:04:30,718
Go and tie the knot.

793
01:04:32,295 --> 01:04:32,870
Take it.

794
01:04:33,089 --> 01:04:34,452
-Should I tie it so soon?
-Yes.

01:04:37,545 --> 01:04:40,643
My own people have looted me! [gibberish]

797
01:04:46,426 --> 01:04:47,200
And this one too!

798
01:04:48,016 --> 01:04:49,358
Shut it already. I meant smoke.

799
01:04:52,276 --> 01:04:53,566
I am crazy about you, Bulbul.

800
01:04:53,862 --> 01:04:55,772
Earlier, I've been out of my way because
of my father's madness about religion.

801
01:04:56,016 --> 01:04:58,865
Now that we are married,
let's live happily like Tom and Jerry.

802
01:04:59,687 --> 01:05:00,227
Father...

803
01:05:02,003 --> 01:05:03,676
If you had told me about
your love with this girl,

804
01:05:03,951 --> 01:05:05,818
I'd have got you married to her. Idiot!

805
01:05:07,467 --> 01:05:09,310
Please forgive me, father-in-law.

806
01:05:09,561 --> 01:05:10,831
Live long and prosper, dear.

807
01:05:11,492 --> 01:05:13,124
-Do you know Hindi too?
-I know Urdu as well.

808
01:05:30,531 --> 01:05:31,902
Go and check cupboard.

01:05:41,190 --> 01:05:43,654
So pretty! My God!

01:05:50,580 --> 01:05:51,756
Go to balcony.

01:06:05,232 --> 01:06:06,399
Very nice!

Hey... Lower the glass... Do it.

Are you blind?
How could you just crash into us?

819
01:06:26,725 --> 01:06:28,671
Oh no! I didn't notice, sir. I am sorry.

820
01:06:29,002 --> 01:06:30,688
Sorry, my foot!
Come out. Come on.

821
01:06:31,068 --> 01:06:32,840
-Just come out.
-I am very sorry, sir.

822
01:06:35,070 --> 01:06:36,993
Please try to understand me.

-I was in a hurry and I didn't notice.
-So what?

Hey... Hey... Hey... Poor girl!

825
01:06:41,377 --> 01:06:41,796
-She did even apologise to you.
-Please.

826
01:06:42,071 --> 01:06:43,725
Being a girl means she can drive
rashly and crash into vehicles?

827
01:06:43,998 --> 01:06:44,532
-It's okay.
-Go away!

828
01:06:44,788 --> 01:06:46,459
Just go and move the bike.

-See you.
-Get into the car, madam.

Actually, I have a speech
before I cut the cake.

841
01:07:34,889 --> 01:07:38,704
In this competitive world,
everyone is busy in their own works.

842
01:07:38,932 --> 01:07:43,659
Amidst those busy works, there would be
one person who would think only about us.

843
01:07:45,601 --> 01:07:47,430
There might be people who'd
give us only when we ask them.

844
01:07:48,945 --> 01:07:51,618
But these people
understand us and give everything.

845
01:07:52,188 --> 01:07:55,602
They'd be right behind us
and guide us to go forward.

That person is none
other than... my father.

Woohoo!

01:08:34,867 --> 01:08:37,311
Don't give me a dangerous
task. Go for easy ones,

855
01:08:37,613 --> 01:08:39,167
because I am a married person.

856
01:08:39,459 --> 01:08:40,890
On top of that, my husband will hit me.

857
01:08:41,183 --> 01:08:42,113
Don't cite these silly reasons.

858
01:08:42,372 --> 01:08:44,308
We are playing 'truth or dare' game.
We won't accept your excuses.

01:08:44,601 --> 01:08:45,149
Okay?

01:08:45,973 --> 01:08:49,530
Look at the guy over there
who is dancing in inebriation.

01:08:49,918 --> 01:08:52,363
-You have to drink from his shot.
-Come on, move.

01:09:01,973 --> 01:09:03,124
Happy birthday.

863
01:09:03,383 --> 01:09:04,160
Thank you.

864
01:09:15,547 --> 01:09:17,728
-Woohoo!
-You did it! Yeah!

865
01:09:19,328 --> 01:09:20,088
We will play.

866
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:23,156
Woohoo!

867
01:09:26,009 --> 01:09:26,866
-Come on.
-Sasi.

868
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:29,124
You have to kiss the next person
who enters from that door.

869
01:09:29,371 --> 01:09:30,345
-What?
-Yes.

870
01:09:30,988 --> 01:09:32,409
-Me?
-Yes.

871
01:09:33,388 --> 01:09:36,326
You have to do it!
You have to do it!

872
01:09:36,553 --> 01:09:38,329
-Sasi has to do it!
-Fine.

873
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:43,117
I will be dead now!

874
01:09:43,936 --> 01:09:44,701
What to do now?

875
01:09:45,361 --> 01:09:47,165
Hey, what's this?

876
01:09:50,446 --> 01:09:51,461
-[burps]
-Whoa!

877
01:09:51,808 --> 01:09:52,559
Alright, I will go.

878
01:09:57,374 --> 01:09:58,640
Oh my God! Thanks!

879
01:09:59,007 --> 01:10:00,563
Go... Go... Go, Sasi. Go.

880
01:10:00,808 --> 01:10:02,167
-All the best.
-All the best, Sasi.

881
01:10:02,557 --> 01:10:03,336
Yeah!

882
01:10:39,996 --> 01:10:40,835
Bye, dad.

883
01:10:41,225 --> 01:10:43,439
Shall I drop you at your college, dear?

884
01:10:43,651 --> 01:10:45,360
Why, dad? I'll go by myself.

885
01:10:46,904 --> 01:10:48,852
What happened, dad?
Why are you staring like that?

886
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:51,301
Nothing, dear.

887
01:10:51,593 --> 01:10:55,455
It used to be very painful when I have to
leave you after dropping you at the school

888
01:10:56,344 --> 01:11:00,271
And now when you are leaving me,
I am feeling the same pain.

889
01:11:01,688 --> 01:11:03,929
Tsk!
If you are getting so pained about this,

890
01:11:04,205 --> 01:11:05,001
how can you send her to her
in-laws' place after her wedding?

891
01:11:05,229 --> 01:11:08,250
I won't send her at all! I'd rather find
a matrilocal son-in-law. Any objections?

892
01:11:09,542 --> 01:11:10,988
-Alright, it is getting late for you.
-Bye, dad.

893
01:11:11,276 --> 01:11:12,004
-Bye.
-Bye.

894
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:16,291
Oh no!

895
01:11:16,491 --> 01:11:17,161
You go first.

896
01:11:17,587 --> 01:11:19,518
No... We are doomed today!

897
01:11:20,149 --> 01:11:21,047
[exclaims]

898
01:11:21,554 --> 01:11:22,630
Why have you stopped here?

899
01:11:22,900 --> 01:11:23,654
[in unison] Ragging!

900
01:11:24,869 --> 01:11:25,876
Ragging?

901
01:11:26,756 --> 01:11:27,351
So what?

902
01:11:28,088 --> 01:11:29,782
We and our gang have a certain rep, right?

903
01:11:30,207 --> 01:11:31,963
One has to get scared seeing us.

904
01:11:32,163 --> 01:11:34,185
-You are right.
-We fear no one when you are with us.

905
01:11:34,422 --> 01:11:35,056
Let's go.

906
01:11:35,256 --> 01:11:35,984
Let's go.

907
01:11:38,736 --> 01:11:41,462
You don't know bow table.
You know nothing.

908
01:11:41,856 --> 01:11:42,954
But all you know is just eating.

909
01:11:44,156 --> 01:11:45,645
Alright, leave. Go.

910
01:11:48,401 --> 01:11:50,417
Hello... Hello... Cuties! Come here.

911
01:11:51,439 --> 01:11:52,044
Come.

912
01:11:52,774 --> 01:11:55,084
While a glamourous guy is sitting
on a Pulsar bike under the sun

913
01:11:55,288 --> 01:11:57,463
and striving to rag, why
are you going away silently?

914
01:11:57,782 --> 01:11:59,980
You look like a collyrium.

915
01:12:00,203 --> 01:12:01,587
How come you claim yourself
to be a glamourous guy?

916
01:12:03,030 --> 01:12:05,232
She has struck me
exactly at the forbidden spot.

917
01:12:06,324 --> 01:12:07,563
Look, let me tell you something.

918
01:12:08,144 --> 01:12:10,470
When you go to a police station or
during the first day of your college

919
01:12:10,679 --> 01:12:12,131
you have be very diligent and mindful.

920
01:12:12,431 --> 01:12:12,968
You shouldn't
go overboard.

921
01:12:13,231 --> 01:12:14,659
When you go overboard,
it triggers the area of anger.

922
01:12:14,930 --> 01:12:16,036
Right now, I got triggered at that point.

923
01:12:16,236 --> 01:12:19,167
Hence, apply collyrium to your face
and come to college. Leave... Shoo!

924
01:12:19,541 --> 01:12:19,951
Hmph!

925
01:12:20,940 --> 01:12:23,226
Just go away, you bloody
double-decker box!

926
01:12:25,506 --> 01:12:27,593
Hey... Psst... Please come.

927
01:12:28,349 --> 01:12:30,249
-What's your name?
-Sasi, sir.

928
01:12:30,706 --> 01:12:32,820
Though you don't have great looks as mine.
It's okay that you are just average.

929
01:12:33,054 --> 01:12:35,161
But, what cosmetics do you use
to enhance your skin colour?

930
01:12:35,361 --> 01:12:36,759
[weeping]

931
01:12:39,838 --> 01:12:41,471
Why are you crying, dear?

932
01:12:41,738 --> 01:12:44,514
Generally, I am very scared
to talk to strangers, sir.

933
01:12:44,784 --> 01:12:47,436
But here, you are ragging.
It is making me shiver, sir.

934
01:12:47,692 --> 01:12:48,134
It is okay to be scared.

935
01:12:48,334 --> 01:12:50,156
But if someone sees you,
they would think that I've done something.

936
01:12:51,642 --> 01:12:54,297
Leave... Just leave.
Don't cry, just leave.

937
01:12:54,823 --> 01:12:56,698
-What about my friends?
-Send them away as well, guys.

938
01:12:57,641 --> 01:12:59,385
Hey... Hey... Let go of them.
Send them away.

939
01:12:59,632 --> 01:13:00,924
-Okay, bro...
-Let's go.

940
01:13:02,538 --> 01:13:06,104
You've hyped about our gang and behaved
like Chiranjeevi from Gangleader initially

941
01:13:06,616 --> 01:13:07,834
But how come you
behaved in this manner here?

942
01:13:09,271 --> 01:13:12,341
"One should sense the point of compromise
rather than the point of winning,"

943
01:13:12,602 --> 01:13:14,990
said Power Star Pavan Kalyan.

944
01:13:15,861 --> 01:13:16,503
Got it?

945
01:13:17,401 --> 01:13:22,101
[indistinct music playing]
[clapping]

946
01:13:34,879 --> 01:13:39,851
[music mutes voice]

947
01:14:02,503 --> 01:14:03,338
Actually...

948
01:14:04,489 --> 01:14:07,660
my friends threw me a challenge when
we were playing 'truth or dare' game.

949
01:14:07,916 --> 01:14:10,185
So, I have done that act. I am sorry, sir.

950
01:14:10,402 --> 01:14:13,186
Alright. Someday,
I too will play 'truth or dare' game.

951
01:14:13,929 --> 01:14:15,048
And I will get my turn.

952
01:14:15,475 --> 01:14:16,333
Then, I will take you to the task.

953
01:14:18,576 --> 01:14:19,277
Thank you.

954
01:14:29,629 --> 01:14:31,263
-How are you doing?
-I am doing well, brother.

955
01:14:31,521 --> 01:14:33,655
-How is Sasi doing?
-He too is doing well.

956
01:14:33,887 --> 01:14:35,135
Study well and don't waste your time.

957
01:14:35,397 --> 01:14:36,605
Just a moment, little sister
wants to speak to you.

958
01:14:37,870 --> 01:14:38,822
-Hello brother.
-Hi.

959
01:14:39,081 --> 01:14:39,698
-Shall I serve rice?
-When are you coming?

960
01:14:39,898 --> 01:14:40,441
No, mother.

961
01:14:40,685 --> 01:14:44,096
What is it about, me or the
gift that I am bringing?

962
01:14:44,437 --> 01:14:46,173
-Of course, it is about the gift.
-I'll bring it.

963
01:14:46,931 --> 01:14:48,588
-Walk carefully, son.
-Okay?

964
01:14:48,855 --> 01:14:49,991
Sorry, dad.

965
01:14:50,314 --> 01:14:51,963
I've got intoxicated a bit
excess out of the joy of your arrival.

966
01:14:52,228 --> 01:14:55,109
It's okay because it
happens once in a while.

967
01:14:57,370 --> 01:14:58,886
-Slowly...
-Be careful, dad.

968
01:15:00,299 --> 01:15:01,885
Sleep. Rise your head.

969
01:15:09,581 --> 01:15:11,859
I feel very surprised by you, Dhora.

970
01:15:12,454 --> 01:15:15,838
You won't question him at all for
boozing with you despite being your son.

971
01:15:16,255 --> 01:15:19,119
Son? I treat him as my friend.

972
01:15:20,743 --> 01:15:23,960
If I treat him as a son, I would be
compelled to put him under control.

973
01:15:24,934 --> 01:15:28,249
If I treat him as a friend,
I could share everything with him.

974
01:15:28,738 --> 01:15:30,348
That's the point! [sighs]

975
01:15:37,461 --> 01:15:39,850
I know nothing except music orchestra.

976
01:15:42,421 --> 01:15:44,635
Those were the days when
Jyothi came into my life.

977
01:15:45,517 --> 01:15:49,844
She lived up to her name by
filling my dark life with light.

978
01:15:51,341 --> 01:15:55,803
Though the orchestra had an
average run, we lived very happily.

979
01:15:57,453 --> 01:16:02,161
But at that time, she left this
world by pouring life into him.

980
01:16:03,486 --> 01:16:05,497
My life stopped all of a sudden.

981
01:16:07,497 --> 01:16:09,217
I became a loner again.

982
01:16:10,089 --> 01:16:11,415
I wanted to die.

983
01:16:13,859 --> 01:16:15,471
Then, he cried at that time.

984
01:16:17,537 --> 01:16:21,485
With his cry, he has saved my life.

985
01:16:22,190 --> 01:16:23,345
Then, I have fixed my mind,

986
01:16:24,697 --> 01:16:28,432
that he should never cry.

987
01:16:29,476 --> 01:16:32,833
I've left the loss-making
orchestra and been doing a job,

988
01:16:33,972 --> 01:16:36,817
and taking care of him happily.

989
01:16:38,990 --> 01:16:42,044
But there is a lot of
difference in doing what we like

990
01:16:43,582 --> 01:16:47,864
and doing out of necessity.

991
01:16:52,531 --> 01:16:53,286
Music...

992
01:16:55,096 --> 01:16:56,186
that's all together
a different thing.

993
01:17:16,278 --> 01:17:17,120
Well, tell me something.

994
01:17:17,397 --> 01:17:20,059
Is your abducted husband taking
good care of you or torturing?

995
01:17:20,259 --> 01:17:21,863
Look, my darling has arrived.

996
01:17:23,427 --> 01:17:24,909
Oh man! I am dead!

997
01:17:26,179 --> 01:17:27,145
Alright. Sit down.

998
01:17:29,445 --> 01:17:32,069
You'd nicely greet saying good morning
or good evening even when not asked.

999
01:17:32,281 --> 01:17:34,419
But you'd never answer my questions
no matter how much I ask you.

1000
01:17:34,724 --> 01:17:35,248
What kind of a twist is this!

1001
01:17:35,529 --> 01:17:38,090
I ain't such a kind of
lecturer who wastes time

1002
01:17:38,365 --> 01:17:41,056
seeking your
introduction and other details.

1003
01:17:41,399 --> 01:17:44,384
I am the most sincere... I'll smash
your head. Look at me when I am taking.

1004
01:17:44,884 --> 01:17:47,847
I am the most strict and
sincere professor of this college.

1005
01:17:48,456 --> 01:17:49,395
How come he has arrived here?

1006
01:17:49,688 --> 01:17:51,085
Why didn't you tell me
before, that he is a professor?

1007
01:17:51,478 --> 01:17:54,196
You asked his name but not what he does.

1008
01:17:54,494 --> 01:17:55,712
So, I didn't tell you.

1009
01:17:56,643 --> 01:17:58,598
How come you trapped us like this? ****

1010
01:17:58,915 --> 01:18:01,173
-Fatima...
-Seems like I've heard this voice before.

1011
01:18:03,203 --> 01:18:03,850
Excuse me.

1012
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:04,872
[gasps]

1013
01:18:05,285 --> 01:18:06,330
Excuse me, I am talking to you. Hello.

1014
01:18:08,327 --> 01:18:09,858
-Stand up
-Me?

1015
01:18:10,085 --> 01:18:10,859
Yes. Get up.

1016
01:18:13,935 --> 01:18:18,012
I've been waiting to seek revenge since
a long time and you've got caught nicely!

1017
01:18:19,652 --> 01:18:21,723
As if the robber hid in the police
station after committing robbery!

1018
01:18:21,946 --> 01:18:22,926
Don't chide her.

1019
01:18:23,204 --> 01:18:24,556
-She's my friend.
-Silence!

1020
01:18:25,829 --> 01:18:28,480
Relations can be tolerated in
real estate. But this is college.

1021
01:18:28,717 --> 01:18:32,721
I am the professor and
you are my... student.

1022
01:18:32,939 --> 01:18:33,903
Put that Mangalsutra (holy
wedding thread) inside.

1023
01:18:34,363 --> 01:18:35,324
That doesn't work.

1024
01:18:35,819 --> 01:18:36,792
Stand up on the bench.

1025
01:18:38,791 --> 01:18:40,001
I am coming to you.

1026
01:18:42,981 --> 01:18:45,338
Don't push yourself! The property
might get damaged. Sit down.

1027
01:18:48,511 --> 01:18:49,148
And you...

1028
01:18:52,117 --> 01:18:54,483
Do you know, you have hit me on
my nose and it is still painful?

1029
01:18:55,091 --> 01:18:57,752
Not one day or two days,
but you will be here for four years.

1030
01:18:58,554 --> 01:18:59,689
I'll show you hell.

1031
01:19:02,207 --> 01:19:02,836
[scoffs]

1032
01:19:07,003 --> 01:19:10,392
I heard somewhere that
music is supposed to happen.

1033
01:19:11,365 --> 01:19:12,405
But you've happened to me, Sasi.

1034
01:19:16,421 --> 01:19:18,184
All these days,
I thought music is my passion.

1035
01:19:19,042 --> 01:19:22,834
But I realised last night that it is an
emotion born along with me 25 years ago.

1036
01:19:25,543 --> 01:19:29,755
Yes. Compromising in
life is an adjustment.

1037
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:31,744
And if that compromise is about
life, then it is a punishment.

1038
01:19:33,332 --> 01:19:34,678
Dhora considers music as his life.

1039
01:19:35,681 --> 01:19:38,386
Regardless of the condition of how he
has left it, I am the reason behind it.

1040
01:19:40,644 --> 01:19:42,004
From now on, there will be no compromise.

1041
01:19:42,827 --> 01:19:44,121
I will bestow music to Dhora again.

1042
01:19:44,789 --> 01:19:45,696
Let's start a band.

1043
01:19:47,087 --> 01:19:47,753
Yeah!

1044
01:19:53,422 --> 01:19:57,891
If we have to achieve something, we
have to first overcome our weaknesses.

1045
01:19:58,618 --> 01:20:01,072
Loneliness can turn a
habit into addiction.

1046
01:20:01,385 --> 01:20:03,432
Are you feeling as a loner
even after having me with you?

1047
01:20:06,711 --> 01:20:08,626
Tsk! Why are you operating
the phone while eating?

1048
01:20:09,470 --> 01:20:10,563
My friend, mom.

1049
01:20:11,232 --> 01:20:13,673
She has messaged notifying me that
there is a fresher's day tomorrow.

1050
01:20:14,061 --> 01:20:18,320
[Telugu song playing]

1051
01:20:36,916 --> 01:20:38,713
Woohoo! Yeah!

1052
01:20:38,999 --> 01:20:39,600
Hey!

1053
01:20:40,739 --> 01:20:42,333
Hey, what's with your getup?

1054
01:20:42,534 --> 01:20:43,742
-It made you crazy, right?
-Yes.

1055
01:20:43,988 --> 01:20:45,196
Now, these girls will also turn crazy.

1056
01:20:45,572 --> 01:20:48,066
Fifty percent of the college has already
become awestruck by my glamour.

1057
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:49,398
And with the upcoming performance,

1058
01:20:49,684 --> 01:20:51,269
the rest of the 50% too would be awetruck.

1059
01:20:51,469 --> 01:20:56,801
[Telugu song playing]

1060
01:21:12,486 --> 01:21:13,155
Ah!

1061
01:21:13,355 --> 01:21:15,398
[laughing]

1062
01:21:17,694 --> 01:21:18,245
Go away!

1063
01:21:20,522 --> 01:21:21,545
Stop it!

1064
01:21:31,382 --> 01:21:32,553
Is it so funny?

1065
01:21:32,786 --> 01:21:33,922
You go and perform,
you'll understand the pain.

1066
01:21:35,654 --> 01:21:37,549
I won't simply spare you.
Give that to me.

1067
01:21:38,362 --> 01:21:39,822
Hey, just forget it.

1068
01:21:40,167 --> 01:21:42,374
Did Duryodhana spare Panchali on
compassionate grounds for laughing at him?

1069
01:21:42,576 --> 01:21:43,210
I too won't forget it.

1070
01:21:50,656 --> 01:21:52,316
-Me?
-Oh, you want me to play? Go!

1071
01:21:53,206 --> 01:21:53,858
Just go.

1072
01:21:54,395 --> 01:21:56,470
-Hey...
-You'd go overboard for everything.

1073
01:21:57,110 --> 01:21:58,980
She'll be doomed today!

1074
01:22:00,909 --> 01:22:02,133
Oh, she is seeking blessings!

1075
01:22:02,538 --> 01:22:08,194
[laughing]
Oh no!

1076
01:22:10,474 --> 01:22:12,925
You can't play violin!

1077
01:22:13,196 --> 01:22:14,915
-You've got no music sense!
-Stop it, dude!

1078
01:22:15,428 --> 01:22:16,329
Hey, just let go and sit down.

1079
01:22:38,875 --> 01:22:39,660
Just stop it!

1080
01:22:43,110 --> 01:22:44,731
You've played it very well!

1081
01:22:44,951 --> 01:22:46,853
Thank you!
But I am not as good as you, sir.

1082
01:22:47,432 --> 01:22:49,598
There are no standards for music. It
should appease people. That's it.

1083
01:22:50,703 --> 01:22:52,211
By the way, I am Sasi.

1084
01:22:52,502 --> 01:22:54,777
What a surprise!
Even my name is Sasi, sir.

1085
01:22:58,282 --> 01:23:00,820
Not just music, our names too got matched.

1086
01:23:01,717 --> 01:23:03,151
I'll leave. I'm getting late.

1087
01:23:03,410 --> 01:23:04,522
-Okay, bye.
-Bye.

1088
01:23:07,039 --> 01:23:08,198
Sir, how could you pass it in that manner?

1089
01:23:08,461 --> 01:23:09,348
Think about it.

1090
01:23:09,627 --> 01:23:11,322
What happens to me if something
bad happens in the future?

1091
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:13,597
Won't you take my reputation
into consideration at all?

1092
01:23:13,847 --> 01:23:14,693
-Mr Shastri
-Eh!

1093
01:23:17,002 --> 01:23:17,812
-Ah!
-What?

1094
01:23:20,244 --> 01:23:21,198
-Have you got any sense?
-Hey!

1095
01:23:21,433 --> 01:23:23,404
How can you pinch a girl
despite being a lecturer?

1096
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:24,846
Look, there are two things here.

1097
01:23:25,052 --> 01:23:27,199
I didn't know you were a
girl until you told me.

1098
01:23:28,100 --> 01:23:28,826
The second point is...

1099
01:23:29,186 --> 01:23:31,022
If I feel like pinching, I have my
wife at home and I'll do it to her.

1100
01:23:31,310 --> 01:23:32,768
But I have no patience to
invest on pinching her even.

1101
01:23:32,968 --> 01:23:34,042
I'll complain to my mom.

1102
01:23:34,577 --> 01:23:35,426
I'll complain to my father.

1103
01:23:36,622 --> 01:23:38,058
They've got hallucinations.

1104
01:23:41,222 --> 01:23:42,345
Oh! This is her act?

1105
01:23:42,985 --> 01:23:45,067
Oh fair girl, I'll take you to task!

1106
01:23:45,495 --> 01:23:46,763
Today, we had good thrill!

1107
01:23:47,060 --> 01:23:48,020
My dear husband...

1108
01:23:48,695 --> 01:23:49,988
Why are you going overboard?

1109
01:23:50,498 --> 01:23:51,798
Are you thinking that
I'd seek revenge either by

1110
01:23:52,069 --> 01:23:54,401
making you stand on the
bench or hit you with chalk?

1111
01:23:54,601 --> 01:23:57,491
You are just seeing my lecturer
angle only, but not my wicked side.

1112
01:23:57,765 --> 01:23:59,714
If I snap my fingers,
a gang of goons would arrive here.

1113
01:24:00,005 --> 01:24:01,276
-Oh!
-They'll take you down in seconds.

1114
01:24:01,513 --> 01:24:04,289
-Alright, snap your fingers.
-Oh! Are you having so much confidence?

1115
01:24:05,322 --> 01:24:06,064
Your ill-fate!

1116
01:24:12,915 --> 01:24:14,378
Where the hell are these guys?

1117
01:24:14,838 --> 01:24:17,480
Use the skin care products which I
have mentioned. Hey, not now. Just go.

1118
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:18,897
-It is me.
-Oh sir, it is you?

1119
01:24:19,111 --> 01:24:19,967
Why weren't you coming
when I was snapping?

1120
01:24:20,230 --> 01:24:21,768
Nowadays,
people are snapping for petty tasks.

1121
01:24:22,051 --> 01:24:23,410
The other day, a guy snapped
to get his zip closed.

1122
01:24:23,669 --> 01:24:26,222
-We could do that to you, but not him.
-I have a lace, not zip.

1123
01:24:26,509 --> 01:24:27,713
Hey, a girl is teasing me.

1124
01:24:28,469 --> 01:24:30,950
-Tell me who she is, I'll kill her today.
-[indistinct voice]

1125
01:24:31,503 --> 01:24:32,095
Yeah!

1126
01:24:32,629 --> 01:24:33,516
I think you might be that girl for sure.

1127
01:24:33,722 --> 01:24:35,916
-Come, let's go.
-Hey, she is my wife.

1128
01:24:36,858 --> 01:24:37,861
She is Fatima Bulbul!

1129
01:24:38,929 --> 01:24:40,862
-Why is your taste so terrible?
-Is it really necessary now?

1130
01:24:41,145 --> 01:24:42,005
Look into the task for
which you have come.

1131
01:24:42,213 --> 01:24:43,742
Of course, I am least bothered
about your family matters.

1132
01:24:43,995 --> 01:24:46,755
I was told that someone teased
the lecturer. Show up voluntarily--

1133
01:24:48,099 --> 01:24:48,739
Hi sister.

1134
01:24:49,011 --> 01:24:50,070
Oh, you are in the same class!

1135
01:24:50,631 --> 01:24:51,790
Sister, can you go out for five minutes?

1136
01:24:52,007 --> 01:24:53,102
-It is about to get violent here.
-Hey... Hey...

1137
01:24:53,302 --> 01:24:54,479
She is the one who you
are supposed to rag.

1138
01:24:54,749 --> 01:24:56,528
Stick to only ragging. Don't go for
murder or something of such kind.

1139
01:24:56,819 --> 01:24:57,962
Oh! Just ragging?

1140
01:24:58,162 --> 01:24:59,501
It would become a police case
and cause problems in my family.

1141
01:24:59,701 --> 01:25:00,176
It is true.

1142
01:25:02,079 --> 01:25:03,984
Sister, I don't know that
you are involved in this.

1143
01:25:04,244 --> 01:25:06,163
If I had known that,
I wouldn't have involved in this.

1144
01:25:06,455 --> 01:25:06,913
Oh!

1145
01:25:07,126 --> 01:25:08,734
You are intentionally acting innocent,
aren't you? Hide and attack?

1146
01:25:09,031 --> 01:25:09,628
Carry on. Carry on.

1147
01:25:09,860 --> 01:25:11,522
Sir, let me tell you
something for your well-being.

1148
01:25:13,967 --> 01:25:15,439
Oh, he is here?

1149
01:25:15,736 --> 01:25:17,013
-Why do you want to get involved in this?
-Put it here, dude.

1150
01:25:17,213 --> 01:25:18,601
-We're getting late for the lecture. Come.
-Hold it properly.

1151
01:25:18,900 --> 01:25:21,239
You go to the classroom.
I'll give him a small jolt.

1152
01:25:22,262 --> 01:25:23,895
-Keep going.
-Spin like a top.

1153
01:25:24,189 --> 01:25:25,237
-Good morning, sir.
-Hi.

1154
01:25:25,944 --> 01:25:27,767
I need to talk to you, sir.

1155
01:25:28,011 --> 01:25:28,644
What is it?

1156
01:25:28,860 --> 01:25:29,767
It is a personal matter, sir.

1157
01:25:30,059 --> 01:25:31,312
Wow! All the girls in the
college are chasing you!

1158
01:25:31,608 --> 01:25:33,117
I don't really understand
about how glamour works.

1159
01:25:33,373 --> 01:25:34,626
-Every girl wants me.
-Go.

1160
01:25:35,594 --> 01:25:38,650
Hey, she called me. It is my
personal matter. Stay here.

1161
01:25:43,958 --> 01:25:45,414
I grasped that you fell for me at the very
moment when you asked me to come aside.

1162
01:25:45,683 --> 01:25:47,138
What do you want, a hug or a kiss?

1163
01:25:49,404 --> 01:25:54,042
-If you ever rag any student...
-No, sister. I won't dare at all.

1164
01:25:55,085 --> 01:25:56,421
-What does it mean?
-Sister, if you get into any problem,

1165
01:25:56,689 --> 01:25:57,516
just snap your fingers and I'll be there.

1166
01:25:57,789 --> 01:25:58,638
I can't hear your snapping.

1167
01:25:58,896 --> 01:25:59,518
Hey... Hey...

1168
01:26:00,151 --> 01:26:00,713
Hmm?

1169
01:26:15,115 --> 01:26:16,763
[exclaims] Whoa!

1170
01:26:35,775 --> 01:26:36,735
[gasps]

1171
01:26:41,535 --> 01:26:45,974
Well, today I will play 'truth or dare'
game and get the 'dare' option.

1172
01:26:47,446 --> 01:26:49,139
Don't do that, sir. Please.

1173
01:26:49,981 --> 01:26:52,959
I'll lose if you say so.

1174
01:26:53,728 --> 01:26:56,584
The other day, I have made you win.
Now, it is your turn to return the favour.

1175
01:26:58,326 --> 01:26:59,864
Please, sir. Don't do this.

1176
01:27:00,073 --> 01:27:01,535
Everyone is watching.

1177
01:27:02,333 --> 01:27:05,087
All of you, close your eyes.
Just close your eyes!

1178
01:27:05,808 --> 01:27:07,863
Hey Bulbul, should I tell you
specially. Just close your eyes.

1179
01:27:10,031 --> 01:27:11,954
Not that way. Do it like this.
Come on, close!

1180
01:27:15,001 --> 01:27:17,900
Everyone has closed their
eyes. Now, it's just two of us.

1181
01:27:18,206 --> 01:27:18,785
Come closer.

1182
01:27:19,944 --> 01:27:20,596
Okay.

1183
01:27:21,109 --> 01:27:21,935
-I'll come closer.
-Hmm...

1184
01:27:46,199 --> 01:27:50,805
"This is love... Yes, this is love
whether you accept it or not"

1185
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:55,590
"This is love... Yes, this is
love and I am in your magic"

1186
01:27:55,964 --> 01:28:00,383
"This is love... Yes, this is love
whether anyone accepts it or not"

1187
01:28:00,863 --> 01:28:05,246
"This is love... Yes, this is
love and I am in your magic"

1188
01:28:06,275 --> 01:28:10,418
"Are you the one who is
filled in my thoughts?"

1189
01:28:10,933 --> 01:28:15,717
"Are you the oscillations of my heart?"

1190
01:28:16,004 --> 01:28:20,716
"Are you the warbling eyes?"

1191
01:28:21,046 --> 01:28:25,225
"Are are the playful sky?"

1192
01:29:04,942 --> 01:29:09,687
"There's been scintillation
all around the earth"

1193
01:29:09,905 --> 01:29:14,372
"because of you"

1194
01:29:14,735 --> 01:29:19,479
"The Milky way is formed because of me"

1195
01:29:19,679 --> 01:29:24,285
"But it has got a bright
smiling face because of you"

1196
01:29:24,586 --> 01:29:28,644
"Spread love...
or it will put you in coma"

1197
01:29:29,445 --> 01:29:34,002
"Regardless of the language,
the emotion is the same"

1198
01:29:34,499 --> 01:29:38,889
"Heighten the love
before it ditches the heart"

1199
01:29:39,152 --> 01:29:43,758
"No matter what comes
across, it becomes lively"

1200
01:29:46,341 --> 01:29:50,618
"This is love... Yes, this is love
whether anyone accepts it or not"

1201
01:29:51,106 --> 01:29:55,494
"This is love... Yes, this is
love and I am in your magic"

1202
01:29:56,043 --> 01:30:00,429
"This is love... Yes, this is love
whether anyone accepts it or not"

1203
01:30:00,849 --> 01:30:05,451
"This is love... Yes, this is
love and I am in your magic"

1204
01:30:06,281 --> 01:30:10,601
"Are you the slippery eyeshade?"

1205
01:30:11,060 --> 01:30:14,933
"Are you the celestial heaven?"

1206
01:30:15,915 --> 01:30:20,615
"Are you the nebula?"

1207
01:30:20,970 --> 01:30:24,554
"Are you my confinement?"

1208
01:30:25,536 --> 01:30:29,705
"This is love... Yes, this is love
whether anyone accepts it or not"

1209
01:30:30,323 --> 01:30:34,845
"This is love... Yes, this is
love and I am in your magic"

1210
01:30:35,725 --> 01:30:39,963
"Are you the one who is
outlying and my burden?"

1211
01:30:40,398 --> 01:30:44,250
"Are you the path and its divergence?"

1212
01:30:45,296 --> 01:30:50,028
"Are you alacrity and morality?"

1213
01:30:50,367 --> 01:30:54,900
"Are you the beginning and the ending?"

1214
01:31:35,938 --> 01:31:36,939
Hellos!

1215
01:31:37,172 --> 01:31:39,033
When I went to the classroom for Raj sir,

1216
01:31:39,235 --> 01:31:41,189
I was told that he'd found
wherever Sasi sir would be.

1217
01:31:41,389 --> 01:31:44,027
When I ask about Sasi sir, they'd
say that I'd find him with Raj sir.

1218
01:31:45,010 --> 01:31:48,369
Everyone is telling greatly
about your friendship, sir.

1219
01:31:50,864 --> 01:31:52,165
Since you too have become one of us,

1220
01:31:52,456 --> 01:31:54,618
when enquired about your
whereabouts they'd direct towards us.

1221
01:32:02,100 --> 01:32:02,742
[clears throat]

1222
01:32:03,736 --> 01:32:05,539
I'll wait at the music hall.
You guys carry on.

1223
01:32:05,819 --> 01:32:06,913
-Okay, bye.
-Okay, dude. Bye.

1224
01:32:07,335 --> 01:32:08,717
Guys, let's go.

1225
01:32:28,895 --> 01:32:32,101
My life is going well when
there is one Sasi in my life.

1226
01:32:33,165 --> 01:32:35,969
With your addition, it would become great.

1227
01:32:39,023 --> 01:32:39,982
Love you, Sasi.

1228
01:32:44,756 --> 01:32:46,143
Should I tell him or not?

1229
01:32:46,894 --> 01:32:48,519
Should I tell him or not?

1230
01:32:49,391 --> 01:32:53,023
I want to hear the love
that I see in your eyes.

1231
01:32:59,523 --> 01:33:00,536
Hi, sir!

1232
01:33:04,038 --> 01:33:04,893
Hi.

1233
01:33:09,545 --> 01:33:11,760
Okay, sir. It's getting late for my class.

1234
01:33:12,733 --> 01:33:13,505
You come with me.

1235
01:33:16,744 --> 01:33:19,466
Actually, I am too getting
late. I will see you later.

1236
01:33:20,931 --> 01:33:21,606
Bye.

1237
01:33:26,503 --> 01:33:27,233
Damn!

1238
01:33:37,766 --> 01:33:38,606
Hi, dad!

1239
01:33:41,203 --> 01:33:42,971
Why are you dull?
What happened?

1240
01:33:44,622 --> 01:33:45,663
Have water.

1241
01:33:49,648 --> 01:33:50,543
Well, the thing is that...

1242
01:33:51,851 --> 01:33:53,455
I got transferred to Vijayawada.

1243
01:33:54,068 --> 01:33:55,516
We have to go there within two days.

1244
01:33:56,841 --> 01:33:58,405
What is this transfer all of a sudden?

1245
01:33:58,605 --> 01:33:59,591
It didn't happen suddenly.

1246
01:33:59,883 --> 01:34:01,084
Its proposal has been on
the table for many days.

1247
01:34:01,304 --> 01:34:04,428
I've been stalling it all these days.
Now, I don't have any choice.

1248
01:34:04,909 --> 01:34:05,616
We have to go.

1249
01:34:06,222 --> 01:34:08,889
Well, I have even found a college for you.

1250
01:34:10,928 --> 01:34:14,090
A sudden change of college will
be so much inconvenient, dad.

1251
01:34:14,374 --> 01:34:16,728
Well, I will stay in a hostel
and finish this semester here.

1252
01:34:16,963 --> 01:34:19,715
I'd quit my job rather than to
choose to live away from you.

1253
01:34:20,379 --> 01:34:22,222
You know me, can I really live
happily by staying away from you?

1254
01:34:24,254 --> 01:34:26,795
Alright! I'll quit my job.

1255
01:34:27,119 --> 01:34:28,552
What are you even talking?

1256
01:34:29,297 --> 01:34:31,163
How come you want to quit
your job for this petty matter?

1257
01:34:32,386 --> 01:34:33,923
Anyhow, what's with staying
back and studying here?

1258
01:34:34,293 --> 01:34:36,415
-There are better colleges over there--
-Hey, just leave it.

1259
01:34:37,033 --> 01:34:38,036
Don't you talk in between.

1260
01:34:39,126 --> 01:34:41,698
Alright, dear! I'll quit my job.

1261
01:34:42,149 --> 01:34:44,203
No, dad. I'll go with you.

1262
01:34:47,905 --> 01:34:51,694
[humming]

1263
01:34:51,943 --> 01:34:52,600
Hi Sasi.

1264
01:35:03,645 --> 01:35:04,910
Why are you so happy?

1265
01:35:05,312 --> 01:35:05,923
Tsk!

1266
01:35:06,984 --> 01:35:08,370
We'd know your problem
only when you tell us.

1267
01:35:09,239 --> 01:35:12,389
Actually, my dad got
transfer orders to Vijaywada.

1268
01:35:13,285 --> 01:35:14,586
He has to leave tomorrow.

1269
01:35:16,064 --> 01:35:17,107
Why is it, all of a sudden?

1270
01:35:17,747 --> 01:35:20,873
I thought I found a good music
partner and you are leaving!

1271
01:35:22,925 --> 01:35:24,965
Well, did you tell this to Raju?

1272
01:35:25,256 --> 01:35:25,934
Uhuh!

1273
01:35:26,589 --> 01:35:27,203
Hmm?

1274
01:35:27,445 --> 01:35:30,863
I am very scared to even think about
not able to see Raju from tomorrow.

1275
01:35:31,287 --> 01:35:32,456
Are you in love with him?

1276
01:35:34,989 --> 01:35:36,843
You silence has answered me.

1277
01:35:37,724 --> 01:35:38,656
Did you tell him about this?

1278
01:35:39,375 --> 01:35:39,943
Uhuh!

1279
01:35:40,944 --> 01:35:42,611
Are you planning to tell
this after his marriage?

1280
01:35:43,430 --> 01:35:44,077
No.

1281
01:35:44,423 --> 01:35:47,507
Well, forget all this. Come to our
regular hangout place in the evening.

1282
01:35:47,793 --> 01:35:48,686
I'll bring him there.

1283
01:35:48,886 --> 01:35:52,255
By the way, you are going to
Vijayawada, not to America or Australia.

1284
01:35:53,650 --> 01:35:54,437
Well...

1285
01:35:56,033 --> 01:35:58,353
Sasi isn't mere two syllables
to him. It is you and I.

1286
01:35:58,850 --> 01:36:01,592
He cannot sustain without anyone of us.

1287
01:36:01,917 --> 01:36:04,312
Go home happily and
come early in the evening.

1288
01:36:11,950 --> 01:36:12,909
Raju, come with me.

1289
01:36:13,158 --> 01:36:13,723
Where to?

1290
01:36:13,941 --> 01:36:15,287
-Just come with me.
-Where are you taking me?

1291
01:36:21,595 --> 01:36:22,594
-Hey
-Yes.

1292
01:36:22,906 --> 01:36:24,027
Tell me where we are going.

1293
01:36:25,047 --> 01:36:26,654
There won't be any thrill
if I reveal it to you.

1294
01:36:26,941 --> 01:36:28,042
Enjoy when you reach there.

1295
01:36:28,670 --> 01:36:30,264
At least, give me directions.

1296
01:36:30,926 --> 01:36:31,843
Take a left from here.

1297
01:36:39,197 --> 01:36:39,645
Which way now?

1298
01:36:39,939 --> 01:36:40,839
Take a right from that last corner.

1299
01:36:41,049 --> 01:36:42,473
-Hello
-What's this suspense, dude?

1300
01:36:42,772 --> 01:36:44,575
-What are you doing?
-Hello dad, tell me.

1301
01:36:44,879 --> 01:36:46,627
-Hey... Hey...
-Hey... Hey... Hey...

1302
01:36:48,150 --> 01:36:51,528
[collides]
[groans]

1303
01:36:54,972 --> 01:36:55,732
Sasi!

1304
01:36:58,394 --> 01:36:59,965
Sasi... Hey Sasi...

1305
01:37:00,636 --> 01:37:01,361
Hey...

1306
01:37:02,916 --> 01:37:05,623
[grunts] Hey,
call the ambulance.

1307
01:37:05,897 --> 01:37:06,383
Hey, Sasi...

1308
01:37:06,620 --> 01:37:08,320
I've given up boozing
when you have asked me.

1309
01:37:08,541 --> 01:37:11,940
Hey, you will be alright.

1310
01:37:12,463 --> 01:37:15,096
Sasi... Sasi, you will be alright!

1311
01:37:15,433 --> 01:37:16,250
Hey, Sasi...

1312
01:37:16,450 --> 01:37:18,078
-Hey!
-Sasi is in love with you.

1313
01:37:19,733 --> 01:37:22,117
Sasi? Sasi?

1314
01:37:22,975 --> 01:37:23,662
Sasi...

1315
01:37:24,044 --> 01:37:24,934
Sasi...

1316
01:37:25,880 --> 01:37:27,222
Sasi!

1317
01:37:51,340 --> 01:37:56,207
"Your life has abandoned the destiny"

1318
01:37:56,715 --> 01:38:01,484
"And this silence has become disparate"

1319
01:38:01,844 --> 01:38:06,918
"Can your friendship still
continue going strong?"

1320
01:38:07,250 --> 01:38:12,147
"Can the time move
forward in your absence?"

1321
01:38:12,511 --> 01:38:17,176
"There is no one who responds to me"

1322
01:38:17,782 --> 01:38:22,756
"My lips have no control"

1323
01:38:22,984 --> 01:38:28,025
"They didn't seek for this non-existence"

1324
01:38:28,344 --> 01:38:33,468
"And this is not even a dream"

1325
01:39:40,666 --> 01:39:41,510
Come home.

1326
01:39:43,819 --> 01:39:44,734
Just come home!

1327
01:39:47,654 --> 01:39:49,531
Why are you forcibly taking him?

1328
01:39:49,785 --> 01:39:50,312
He will come later.

1329
01:39:50,544 --> 01:39:51,585
I should have taken him long ago.

1330
01:39:52,459 --> 01:39:54,068
I made late and ruined his life.

1331
01:39:54,535 --> 01:39:55,584
What happenned now?

1332
01:39:55,830 --> 01:39:56,536
What else can happen?

1333
01:39:57,501 --> 01:39:59,104
Today, he dented our family honour
by going to the police station.

1334
01:40:00,424 --> 01:40:00,824
I couldn't sleep at nights
out of fear of his future.

1335
01:40:02,671 --> 01:40:04,207
But he's been doing
things in his own terms.

1336
01:40:04,504 --> 01:40:06,012
Nothing would happen to his
life as long as I am there.

1337
01:40:06,291 --> 01:40:06,932
I beg you!

1338
01:40:08,813 --> 01:40:11,921
He boozes, roams around irresponsibly
and gets in brawl everywhere.

1339
01:40:12,625 --> 01:40:13,877
That's happening because of your support.

1340
01:40:15,205 --> 01:40:18,161
To be precise, your very existence is
the cause of his so-called behaviour.

1341
01:40:19,701 --> 01:40:22,066
Would you have done the same
if he is your son? Tell me.

1342
01:40:22,833 --> 01:40:23,783
Would you treat him
in the same manner?

1343
01:40:24,123 --> 01:40:26,904
Brother, let's leave. Come on.

1344
01:40:27,257 --> 01:40:29,374
How come you said such
a terrible thing to me?

1345
01:40:30,091 --> 01:40:32,840
I treated him and my son equally.

1346
01:40:33,146 --> 01:40:35,220
Of course, you have treated him very well.

1347
01:40:36,135 --> 01:40:37,767
But you've been just watching and
doing nothing though he's going wayward.

1348
01:40:39,363 --> 01:40:41,381
How shame of you to
sit with him and booze?

1349
01:40:42,715 --> 01:40:44,123
Anyhow, I didn't come
here to quarrel with you.

1350
01:40:44,772 --> 01:40:45,927
I am here to take my little brother home.

1351
01:40:46,147 --> 01:40:47,068
-Come.
-Hey...

1352
01:40:49,647 --> 01:40:50,522
Let go of me, brother.

1353
01:40:51,898 --> 01:40:55,008
As I didn't return home for one day,
you've come here searching for me.

1354
01:40:55,419 --> 01:40:57,165
You keep thinking about me.

1355
01:40:57,762 --> 01:41:00,171
But... Who does Dhora have?

1356
01:41:01,042 --> 01:41:01,758
Who would come for him?

1357
01:41:04,668 --> 01:41:07,862
After Sasi's death,
Dhora changed very drastically.

1358
01:41:08,470 --> 01:41:09,901
He became a slave of alcohol.

1359
01:41:13,141 --> 01:41:13,813
-Dhora...
-Hmm...

1360
01:41:14,084 --> 01:41:15,091
-Dhora...
-Hmm...

1361
01:41:15,351 --> 01:41:17,218
Dhora... get up.

1362
01:41:21,063 --> 01:41:22,549
I fear what will happen to you if
you get drunk in this manner, Dhora.

1363
01:41:23,154 --> 01:41:27,633
He cried during his infancy
and gave me hope on life.

1364
01:41:29,469 --> 01:41:31,466
And now, he has passed
away and killed that hope.

1365
01:41:32,375 --> 01:41:33,969
Anyway, who do I have?

1366
01:41:34,634 --> 01:41:35,706
I am there for you, Dhora.

1367
01:41:45,024 --> 01:41:46,729
It is not that Dhora is
treating me as his son.

1368
01:41:47,765 --> 01:41:49,489
I am indeed regarding him as a father.

1369
01:41:53,216 --> 01:41:54,682
Please, leave.

1370
01:42:31,989 --> 01:42:34,493
In spite of yesterday's mess,
how come you have come again?

1371
01:42:35,479 --> 01:42:38,323
If he arrives, there would
be a squabble. Kindly leave.

1372
01:42:38,955 --> 01:42:40,242
It's not about yesterday's incident

1373
01:42:40,815 --> 01:42:42,695
or to get into a quarrel with
you that I have come here.

1374
01:42:44,783 --> 01:42:49,604
The Sasi I am watching now and the
Sasi I knew two years ago are the same.

1375
01:42:51,472 --> 01:42:52,745
But not having the same nature.

1376
01:42:54,301 --> 01:42:56,243
Kindly tell me why she became like this.

1377
01:42:57,321 --> 01:42:57,871
Please.

1378
01:43:01,064 --> 01:43:03,574
Do you know our Sasi before?

1379
01:43:13,746 --> 01:43:14,799
I love you, Sasi.

1380
01:43:21,528 --> 01:43:24,431
In that manner, I unintentionally lost
one Sasi who I considered him as my world.

1381
01:43:25,540 --> 01:43:30,111
But I can't wittingly live away from
this Sasi who I have loved very dearly.

1382
01:43:32,542 --> 01:43:34,781
At least, tell me now about
what happened to Sasi.

1383
01:43:35,710 --> 01:43:36,679
On that day,

1384
01:43:37,720 --> 01:43:41,954
she left home very
happily citing an important task.

1385
01:43:43,535 --> 01:43:44,856
Oh no! [screams]
[collides]

1386
01:43:52,932 --> 01:43:55,844
Your daughter is affected
with traumatic brain injury.

1387
01:43:56,549 --> 01:44:00,057
Because of that, she got subjected to
borderline intellectual retardation.

1388
01:44:02,620 --> 01:44:03,731
What does that mean, doctor?

1389
01:44:03,931 --> 01:44:08,501
Generally, the average IQ level of a
human being would be around 90 to 110.

1390
01:44:08,930 --> 01:44:12,721
And the low IQ level
would be around 80 to 90.

1391
01:44:12,992 --> 01:44:15,795
But your daughter's IQ level is below 50.

1392
01:44:17,612 --> 01:44:20,050
Even though your daughter is 20 years old,

1393
01:44:20,250 --> 01:44:22,126
she's got the mental
state of a little kid.

1394
01:44:22,398 --> 01:44:24,173
You have to take care
of her very carefully.

1395
01:44:26,111 --> 01:44:31,226
Since then, we have met every
doctor and prayed to every God.

1396
01:44:32,962 --> 01:44:33,880
-But...
-Hi.

1397
01:44:34,172 --> 01:44:36,368
-Say hi.
-there's no change in her condition at all

1398
01:44:36,881 --> 01:44:40,219
I will take Sasi to any place in
this world and do anything for her.

1399
01:44:41,967 --> 01:44:44,209
I will make her normal again.

1400
01:44:45,825 --> 01:44:49,106
Please... Send Sasi with me.

1401
01:44:49,387 --> 01:44:50,719
What are you even talking, son?

1402
01:44:52,262 --> 01:44:53,791
Can any parent send their daughter...

1403
01:44:54,101 --> 01:44:55,315
-...with considering her condition?
-Will you greet?

1404
01:44:56,306 --> 01:44:58,492
Please... try to understand.

1405
01:44:59,213 --> 01:45:01,939
Since I have understood you,
I have explained what had happened.

1406
01:45:02,765 --> 01:45:04,875
My husband will be back. Don't push it.

1407
01:45:06,283 --> 01:45:08,888
At least from now,
kindly give up on Sasi.

1408
01:45:09,178 --> 01:45:09,797
Please.

1409
01:45:16,811 --> 01:45:18,726
You are telling me to give up
on her as I have loved her.

1410
01:45:20,027 --> 01:45:23,389
What if I've married her and she is in the
same situation? Will you tell the same?

1411
01:45:25,047 --> 01:45:25,800
Hi.

1412
01:45:34,048 --> 01:45:34,774
Don't leave it uneaten.

1413
01:45:56,134 --> 01:45:58,854
Why are you still standing and watching?
Get out!

1414
01:46:05,551 --> 01:46:06,932
Sasi, drink it.

1415
01:46:07,180 --> 01:46:07,933
Yeah.

1416
01:46:15,202 --> 01:46:18,023
Why have you come again
even after that aggression?

1417
01:46:18,920 --> 01:46:23,586
How can we leave our loved ones
citing someone's anger or abuse?

1418
01:46:25,624 --> 01:46:27,458
I know how much Sasi has loved me.

1419
01:46:28,734 --> 01:46:32,378
Let's see whether those memories
would bring any change in her.

1420
01:46:33,444 --> 01:46:34,115
Please.

1421
01:46:41,693 --> 01:46:42,598
Take her, son.

1422
01:46:48,388 --> 01:46:49,006
Son...

1423
01:46:51,345 --> 01:46:52,683
I will bring her back early.

1424
01:46:59,217 --> 01:47:01,526
"You are my only world"

1425
01:47:01,810 --> 01:47:04,085
"You are the beauty of my world"

1426
01:47:04,368 --> 01:47:06,761
"You are the heart of that very beauty"

1427
01:47:06,979 --> 01:47:08,518
"who I have attained"

1428
01:47:09,563 --> 01:47:11,886
"You are the abrupt anger"

1429
01:47:12,130 --> 01:47:14,434
"You are the beacon that
comes out from anger"

1430
01:47:14,709 --> 01:47:17,145
"And you are the beaconless illumination"

1431
01:47:17,345 --> 01:47:19,425
"who lit my life"

1432
01:47:19,665 --> 01:47:21,899
"Shall I love you as who you are?"

1433
01:47:22,180 --> 01:47:24,408
"Shall I offer myself to you as I am?"

1434
01:47:24,652 --> 01:47:27,033
"Shall I stand by you all the times"

1435
01:47:27,294 --> 01:47:29,957
"and become your
consort in all the births"

1436
01:47:35,404 --> 01:47:40,233
"Shall I embrace you
with my eyes eternally?"

1437
01:47:40,460 --> 01:47:45,464
"Shall I protect you all the time?"

1438
01:47:45,745 --> 01:47:50,556
"Shall I share the long
forgotten happiness with you?"

1439
01:47:50,759 --> 01:47:55,657
"Shall I drown you in the everlasting joy"

1440
01:47:55,904 --> 01:47:58,854
"and wear smiles on
you as jingling anklets?"

1441
01:48:29,611 --> 01:48:34,525
"My life would become relentless if
I don't see you even for a second"

1442
01:48:34,780 --> 01:48:39,650
"I can't be able to breathe as well
if you even go a step apart from me"

1443
01:48:39,857 --> 01:48:44,730
"When you experience hot sun,
I'll be the one who would sweat"

1444
01:48:44,951 --> 01:48:49,920
"When you experience cold,
I'll be the one who would shiver"

1445
01:48:50,215 --> 01:48:53,224
"It's your body but I am its soul"

1446
01:48:54,047 --> 01:48:56,360
"You are my only world"

1447
01:48:56,567 --> 01:48:58,854
"You are the beauty of my world"

1448
01:48:59,084 --> 01:49:01,524
"You are the heart of that very beauty"

1449
01:49:01,758 --> 01:49:03,389
"who I have attained"

1450
01:49:04,463 --> 01:49:06,627
"You are the abrupt anger"

1451
01:49:06,842 --> 01:49:09,243
"You are the beacon that
comes out from anger"

1452
01:49:09,448 --> 01:49:11,773
"And you are the beaconless illumination"

1453
01:49:12,053 --> 01:49:14,277
"who lit my life"

1454
01:49:14,506 --> 01:49:16,665
"Shall I love you as who you are?"

1455
01:49:16,927 --> 01:49:19,276
"Shall I offer myself to you as I am?"

1456
01:49:19,529 --> 01:49:21,773
"Shall I stand by you all the times"

1457
01:49:22,070 --> 01:49:24,750
"and become your
consort in all the births"

1458
01:49:25,011 --> 01:49:26,881
-[indistinct voice]
-He won't be going anywhere.

1459
01:49:27,156 --> 01:49:30,030
You won't understand anything
now. Someday, he will...

1460
01:49:30,230 --> 01:49:32,401
[music mutes voice]
Hey!

1461
01:49:35,185 --> 01:49:35,730
Puli...

1462
01:49:42,769 --> 01:49:44,795
Wow! [groans]

1463
01:49:46,854 --> 01:49:47,346
Hey!

1464
01:49:50,649 --> 01:49:51,056
Hey!

1465
01:49:54,137 --> 01:49:57,205
Hey... The other day, I
have just touched her.

1466
01:49:58,455 --> 01:50:01,641
-Now, I'll be using her full scale.
-Hey!

1467
01:50:06,103 --> 01:50:06,887
Sasi.

1468
01:50:07,649 --> 01:50:08,487
Hey!

1469
01:50:24,033 --> 01:50:24,568
Hey!

1470
01:50:28,958 --> 01:50:30,011
-Hey!
-Hey!

1471
01:50:32,506 --> 01:50:33,356
Hey!

1472
01:50:43,748 --> 01:50:45,536
-Come.
-Leave me.

1473
01:50:49,038 --> 01:50:50,946
[glass shattering]

1474
01:50:51,950 --> 01:50:53,111
-Come...
-Sasi.

1475
01:50:53,410 --> 01:50:54,746
We shouldn't spare this rogue this time.

1476
01:51:10,458 --> 01:51:11,395
[groans]

1477
01:51:11,885 --> 01:51:12,603
Hey!

1478
01:51:13,681 --> 01:51:14,862
Hey, bloody scoundrel!

1479
01:51:15,557 --> 01:51:16,237
Sasi.

1480
01:51:18,308 --> 01:51:19,908
Sasi...

1481
01:51:22,540 --> 01:51:24,266
Hey, bloody scoundrel!

1482
01:51:24,466 --> 01:51:27,505
[panting]

1483
01:51:28,276 --> 01:51:29,025
Take her quickly!

1484
01:51:29,701 --> 01:51:31,029
Sasi...

1485
01:51:33,149 --> 01:51:33,727
Fast!

1486
01:51:33,927 --> 01:51:35,288
Sir, you shouldn't come inside.

1487
01:51:48,008 --> 01:51:48,899
How is she now?

1488
01:51:50,726 --> 01:51:53,556
Damn! I have unnecessarily
taken her with me, brother.

1489
01:51:55,727 --> 01:51:57,696
She will be alright. Don't worry.

1490
01:51:59,254 --> 01:52:03,562
[device beeping]

1491
01:52:18,087 --> 01:52:19,083
I love you, Sasi.

1492
01:52:22,039 --> 01:52:23,206
[gasps]

1493
01:52:24,865 --> 01:52:26,696
Dear... Dear Sasi.

1494
01:52:27,477 --> 01:52:28,303
Dear...

1495
01:52:30,476 --> 01:52:31,183
Dear Sasi...

1496
01:52:40,662 --> 01:52:43,789
Doctor, she just got up
suddenly and passed out.

1497
01:52:44,080 --> 01:52:45,425
You people, please wait outside.

1498
01:52:46,171 --> 01:52:46,875
Let's go.

1499
01:52:59,018 --> 01:53:02,789
Hey! If something bad happens to my
daughter, I won't spare you at all.

1500
01:53:03,079 --> 01:53:05,530
Sir, please don't worry.
She will be alright.

1501
01:53:05,858 --> 01:53:06,568
Who the hell are you?

1502
01:53:07,570 --> 01:53:08,246
I am his brother.

1503
01:53:09,506 --> 01:53:10,189
Brother?

1504
01:53:10,884 --> 01:53:12,360
When he brought my daughter to your house,

1505
01:53:12,630 --> 01:53:14,784
didn't you feel like
telling him that it was wrong?

1506
01:53:15,979 --> 01:53:16,710
Oh!

1507
01:53:17,567 --> 01:53:20,822
He is a rogue. And since you are his
brother, you might be a bigger rogue.

1508
01:53:21,029 --> 01:53:22,846
Uncle! Your anger is about me.

1509
01:53:23,130 --> 01:53:26,785
Vent it on me.
But don't talk ill about my brother.

1510
01:53:27,223 --> 01:53:28,454
Why are you guys still standing here?

1511
01:53:28,835 --> 01:53:30,181
Excuse me, doctor.

1512
01:53:30,724 --> 01:53:32,503
Sir, what is the condition of my daughter?

1513
01:53:32,732 --> 01:53:34,308
Don't worry. Nothing serious.

1514
01:53:34,533 --> 01:53:35,753
She is alright now.

1515
01:53:36,167 --> 01:53:38,935
[sighs] Thank you, sir.
Thank you very much.

1516
01:53:39,764 --> 01:53:40,817
Can I see her now?

1517
01:53:41,042 --> 01:53:42,625
Yes. I gave her an injection.

1518
01:53:42,994 --> 01:53:44,043
She would be little drowsy.

1519
01:53:44,503 --> 01:53:46,153
You can take her home after two hours.

1520
01:53:46,656 --> 01:53:47,969
-Thank you, sir.
-It is okay.

1521
01:53:57,273 --> 01:53:58,609
Get inside and stay with her.

1522
01:53:58,954 --> 01:53:59,627
Okay.

1523
01:54:03,870 --> 01:54:06,541
Be gone before my
daughter gains her consciousness.

1524
01:54:06,843 --> 01:54:08,322
If I am a type of person
who gives up so easily,

1525
01:54:08,848 --> 01:54:11,249
I would have been gone when
you threw coffee at my face.

1526
01:54:12,318 --> 01:54:13,699
I have been in love with Sasi.

1527
01:54:14,483 --> 01:54:15,567
Try to understand it.

1528
01:54:16,225 --> 01:54:16,909
I know that.

1529
01:54:18,279 --> 01:54:20,468
As a matter of fact,
I know about this two years ago.

1530
01:54:30,452 --> 01:54:31,794
I didn't like you even at that time.

1531
01:54:32,838 --> 01:54:35,338
I didn't want to tell this
to my daughter and hurt her.

1532
01:54:36,293 --> 01:54:38,305
So, I opted for a
untimely transfer intentionally.

1533
01:54:39,476 --> 01:54:41,447
I thought she would forget
you if she goes away from you.

1534
01:54:43,895 --> 01:54:46,391
But I didn't expect that she'd go into
a state where she forgets everyone.

1535
01:54:49,013 --> 01:54:49,641
What?

1536
01:54:51,450 --> 01:54:52,431
Have you been loving her?

1537
01:54:53,763 --> 01:54:55,879
Then, what have we been
doing all these years?

1538
01:54:56,216 --> 01:55:00,093
Since her childhood, I've given
everything she wanted, beforehand.

1539
01:55:00,532 --> 01:55:03,552
But in that process, I didn't
give her worthless things.

1540
01:55:03,900 --> 01:55:05,328
I gave only the best.

1541
01:55:06,957 --> 01:55:10,090
The so-called youngster's love would
think about only getting happily married.

1542
01:55:11,658 --> 01:55:12,902
But a father's love like mine

1543
01:55:13,200 --> 01:55:15,609
constantly thinks about how to
keep her happy throughout her life.

1544
01:55:15,996 --> 01:55:19,879
In that process, I have found
Rahul for her, two years ago.

1545
01:55:20,691 --> 01:55:22,780
Since I really have love
and care for my daughter,

1546
01:55:22,998 --> 01:55:24,955
I've been thinking about
the well-being of her future.

1547
01:55:26,438 --> 01:55:28,706
If you have really loved her,
wish for well-being.

1548
01:55:31,606 --> 01:55:33,128
Manamma, my daughter has arrived.

1549
01:55:36,895 --> 01:55:41,731
Mom, did any guy named Rajkumar came
here looking for me in these two years?

1550
01:55:42,357 --> 01:55:43,822
No! No one came, dear.

1551
01:55:44,121 --> 01:55:46,231
Did someone come? No one came, right?

1552
01:55:46,470 --> 01:55:47,206
Uhuh.

1553
01:55:47,989 --> 01:55:50,113
Manamma, did you keep my
daughter's room ready?

1554
01:56:01,450 --> 01:56:02,177
Sasi...

1555
01:56:04,660 --> 01:56:05,723
Have this tablet.

1556
01:56:06,864 --> 01:56:11,434
We'd have lesser problems
if we are kids, right mom?

1557
01:56:11,750 --> 01:56:13,700
I understand why you are feeling sad.

1558
01:56:14,897 --> 01:56:16,795
It is about Raj, isn't it?

1559
01:56:17,705 --> 01:56:19,397
Your father has lied to you.

1560
01:56:20,966 --> 01:56:22,627
Raj came here looking for you.

1561
01:56:25,394 --> 01:56:27,616
I don't know what your father saw in him.

1562
01:56:28,863 --> 01:56:31,950
But I saw him having
immense love for you.

1563
01:56:33,723 --> 01:56:35,747
There won't be any man
who treats lover as a wife

1564
01:56:35,962 --> 01:56:39,313
and treat the same woman
as lover after marriage.

1565
01:56:39,682 --> 01:56:42,221
But Raj would take care
of you in that manner.

1566
01:57:01,821 --> 01:57:05,097
I didn't expect this kind of
distance to come between us,

1567
01:57:05,857 --> 01:57:08,059
in order to answer your proposal.

1568
01:57:10,463 --> 01:57:13,851
I could hardly stay normal for
two days without seeing you.

1569
01:57:14,921 --> 01:57:17,336
When that the case, how come you were
able to bear this for two years, sir?

1570
01:57:18,864 --> 01:57:21,865
Let's not be apart anymore.
Come, let's get married.

1571
01:57:27,944 --> 01:57:28,667
Marriage?

1572
01:57:30,294 --> 01:57:33,088
It's been only two days for you. That's
why you are reacting in this manner.

1573
01:57:33,964 --> 01:57:35,033
It's been two years for me.

1574
01:57:35,978 --> 01:57:37,464
And in the meantime,
a lot of things had happened.

1575
01:57:38,786 --> 01:57:39,732
And I too got changed with the time.

1576
01:57:40,826 --> 01:57:41,612
I won't believe you.

1577
01:57:44,005 --> 01:57:45,747
Belief and truth are like two eyes.

1578
01:57:46,693 --> 01:57:49,312
Though they are right beside each
other, they can never become one.

1579
01:57:49,696 --> 01:57:51,773
Love is not something which you have
to search for it in a non-existing place.

1580
01:57:52,848 --> 01:57:54,244
It is about upholding it in the
very place of its existence.

1581
01:57:54,919 --> 01:57:56,966
Actually, cite my father as the problem.

1582
01:58:00,218 --> 01:58:01,987
My father might not be accepting now.

1583
01:58:02,834 --> 01:58:05,624
If we get married,
he'd be reluctant initially

1584
01:58:05,915 --> 01:58:07,725
but end up accepting us gradually.

1585
01:58:11,225 --> 01:58:14,166
You are talking about your father's
feelings as if they are unimportant.

1586
01:58:14,864 --> 01:58:16,329
What do you know about your father?

1587
01:58:18,756 --> 01:58:21,564
I used to laugh when people
around used to say 'love is blind'.

1588
01:58:23,232 --> 01:58:25,631
But after seeing you,
I want to believe it.

1589
01:58:27,832 --> 01:58:29,432
Open your eyes and think,

1590
01:58:29,735 --> 01:58:32,171
Your father is the one
who cares for you the most.

1591
01:58:34,526 --> 01:58:39,454
He's been constantly trying to give
the best to you since your childhood.

1592
01:58:40,815 --> 01:58:41,832
And I am not one of them.

1593
01:58:44,375 --> 01:58:45,686
To be precise,

1594
01:58:46,675 --> 01:58:51,085
my two years of love for you is negligible
in front of 20 years of your father's.

1595
01:58:55,013 --> 01:58:56,560
But I can tell you something
very clearly, Sasi.

1596
01:58:58,032 --> 01:59:01,337
Our loved ones will never hurt us.

1597
01:59:02,242 --> 01:59:03,988
But you are doing that right now.

1598
01:59:12,965 --> 01:59:16,207
"Not everyone goes through this..."

1599
01:59:16,467 --> 01:59:19,953
"where life becomes so burden"

1600
01:59:20,613 --> 01:59:24,191
"This happens when one
has to choose between"

1601
01:59:24,401 --> 01:59:27,600
"the one who gave life
and the one who is life"

1602
01:59:28,266 --> 01:59:31,254
"My life has bowed to the one"

1603
01:59:31,463 --> 01:59:35,541
"who I owe my life"

1604
01:59:36,130 --> 01:59:39,060
"And ultimately deserted the one"

1605
01:59:39,270 --> 01:59:43,112
"who I regarded as my heart"

1606
01:59:44,026 --> 01:59:47,588
"Not everyone goes through this..."

1607
01:59:47,867 --> 01:59:50,911
"where life becomes so burden"

1608
01:59:51,722 --> 01:59:55,367
"This happens when one
has to choose between"

1609
01:59:55,583 --> 01:59:58,866
"the one who gave life
and the one who is life"

1610
02:00:26,759 --> 02:00:30,592
"After I upheld you for all these days"

1611
02:00:30,849 --> 02:00:34,332
"can I really give up on
you? Is it even possible?"

1612
02:00:34,617 --> 02:00:38,360
"After all these days where I
considered you as my eyes"

1613
02:00:38,574 --> 02:00:42,186
"can I really forget you?
Is it even possible?"

1614
02:00:42,455 --> 02:00:46,127
"But still, I am giving up on you now"

1615
02:00:46,377 --> 02:00:49,671
"by restraining my heart"

1616
02:00:50,287 --> 02:00:53,856
"And I am getting over
you for your well being"

1617
02:00:54,130 --> 02:00:57,586
"and seeking for another life"

1618
02:00:58,253 --> 02:01:01,710
"Not everyone goes through this..."

1619
02:01:01,994 --> 02:01:05,116
"where life becomes so burden"

1620
02:01:09,784 --> 02:01:13,442
Son, don't do this. Don't
go to Mumbai. Please listen to me.

1621
02:01:13,649 --> 02:01:15,470
You tell him at least.

1622
02:01:15,808 --> 02:01:17,534
You have earlier chided me for
not doing anything significant.

1623
02:01:18,699 --> 02:01:20,704
Why are you stopping me now when
I am actually on its pursuit, mom?

1624
02:01:22,551 --> 02:01:23,081
Hey...

1625
02:01:38,857 --> 02:01:39,702
Dear Sasi...

1626
02:01:40,726 --> 02:01:41,235
Here.

1627
02:01:53,186 --> 02:01:54,887
I feel like asking you for the first time.

1628
02:01:55,810 --> 02:01:56,680
Did you like it?

1629
02:01:59,596 --> 02:02:01,379
After expecting that the receiver
would like the gift which you give them,

1630
02:02:02,067 --> 02:02:03,738
you shouldn't ask for an opinion, dad.

1631
02:02:09,128 --> 02:02:09,857
[clears throat]

1632
02:02:11,718 --> 02:02:13,073
I will tell you something.
Will you listen to me?

1633
02:02:13,359 --> 02:02:17,275
Since the groom is of your
choice, she's not happy about it.

1634
02:02:17,788 --> 02:02:19,026
Moreover,
there is no buzz in this wedding.

1635
02:02:20,904 --> 02:02:23,982
Any daughter would become teary-eyed
when she departs to her in-law's house.

1636
02:02:25,044 --> 02:02:29,160
But if she gets married to the guy who
she loved, she'd happily go to his home.

1637
02:02:33,359 --> 02:02:35,362
[honking]

1638
02:02:39,710 --> 02:02:40,777
Where are you going?

1639
02:02:45,044 --> 02:02:45,996
How come you are here?

1640
02:02:46,842 --> 02:02:48,296
First, tell me where you are going.

1641
02:02:48,786 --> 02:02:51,230
"What are you doing?
How much are you earning?"

1642
02:02:51,556 --> 02:02:52,747
If someone like you poses
these questions to me,

1643
02:02:52,975 --> 02:02:53,916
I should have an answer, right?

1644
02:02:55,573 --> 02:02:57,703
So, I am leaving to Mumbai.

1645
02:03:00,274 --> 02:03:04,071
Well, you've got a wedding to preside.
What are you doing here?

1646
02:03:09,906 --> 02:03:11,945
My daughter too fell in
love like every girl.

1647
02:03:12,932 --> 02:03:14,270
I thought that getting
her married to a good guy

1648
02:03:14,542 --> 02:03:16,639
would make her forget
you and live happily.

1649
02:03:16,866 --> 02:03:20,697
But she's been not at all
happy from the time...

1650
02:03:22,893 --> 02:03:24,491
I have fixed her wedding.

1651
02:03:26,830 --> 02:03:29,187
She is my daughter where I've
raised her with utmost care.

1652
02:03:30,095 --> 02:03:32,322
If she continues to be unhappy
like this even after her marriage,

1653
02:03:33,770 --> 02:03:38,397
there would be a fire inside my heart
which can neither be doused by the tears

1654
02:03:39,463 --> 02:03:42,093
nor the flowing streams.

1655
02:03:44,286 --> 02:03:47,538
Well... You said you have
immensely loved Sasi.

1656
02:03:48,002 --> 02:03:49,941
But how come you are going away
so easily by giving up on her?

1657
02:03:56,085 --> 02:03:59,851
Upon seeing Sasi,
I thought my life was back.

1658
02:04:01,847 --> 02:04:03,819
When you have asked me to give up on Sasi,

1659
02:04:05,414 --> 02:04:09,492
I have given up on my life, but not her.

1660
02:04:14,864 --> 02:04:16,767
Since her childhood, I used
to give everything she liked

1661
02:04:17,469 --> 02:04:19,047
and I used to reap happiness out of it.

1662
02:04:20,338 --> 02:04:24,510
But now, I've been hurting her by
deliberately denying what she likes.

1663
02:04:25,882 --> 02:04:28,209
I thought that the guy who
Sasi marries should be

1664
02:04:28,420 --> 02:04:32,351
earning well, have a car
and an expensive house.

1665
02:04:34,238 --> 02:04:36,509
And I have insulted you
citing not having any of these.

1666
02:04:38,005 --> 02:04:40,707
You have changed your character for the
promise you have made to your friend.

1667
02:04:42,495 --> 02:04:45,991
You wanted to marry Sasi
despite knowing her condition.

1668
02:04:47,529 --> 02:04:50,219
And when I insulted you and
asked to give up on my daughter,

1669
02:04:50,677 --> 02:04:51,918
you've been going away by leaving her.

1670
02:04:54,338 --> 02:04:58,825
Hey... I can't get any great guy
for her who is better than you.

1671
02:05:02,727 --> 02:05:05,381
Please forgive me and marry Sasi.

1672
02:05:06,223 --> 02:05:09,317
No, uncle.
You shouldn't be apologising to me.

1673
02:05:11,694 --> 02:05:13,085
Let's go.

1674
02:05:19,499 --> 02:05:21,604
How come the water is in this colour?

1675
02:05:22,349 --> 02:05:25,410
I've mixed some alcohol in
water as I was feeling pained.

1676
02:05:27,758 --> 02:05:29,185
There won't be any pain
in your life anymore.

1677
02:05:29,954 --> 02:05:31,424
And this won't be of use as well.

1678
02:05:38,465 --> 02:05:39,186
Hey...

1679
02:05:40,149 --> 02:05:44,367
As if the moon arrives to fill darkness
with its light, Sasi is here for you.

1680
02:05:45,601 --> 02:05:46,350
Go.

1681
02:06:02,520 --> 02:06:06,116
Didn't I tell you that our
loved ones would never hurt us?

1682
02:06:08,947 --> 02:06:11,209
Then, why were you going away leaving me?

1683
02:06:11,843 --> 02:06:15,358
Well, I have played 'truth
or dare' game over there.

1684
02:06:17,064 --> 02:06:18,657
I chose dare and was told to kiss.

1685
02:06:19,008 --> 02:06:21,028
-That's why I have come back.
-"This is love... Yes, this is love"

1686
02:06:21,300 --> 02:06:23,411
"Whether you accept it or not"

1687
02:06:23,940 --> 02:06:28,346
"This is love... Yes, this is
love and I am in your magic"

1688
02:06:28,818 --> 02:06:33,189
"This is love... Yes, this is love
whether anyone accepts it or not"

1689
02:06:33,847 --> 02:06:38,030
"This is love... Yes, this is
love and I am in your magic"

1690
02:06:38,999 --> 02:06:43,456
"Are you the one who is
filled in my thoughts?"

1691
02:06:43,900 --> 02:06:48,362
"Are you the oscillations of my heart?"

1692
02:06:48,832 --> 02:06:53,086
"Are you the warbling eyes?"

1693
02:06:53,688 --> 02:06:56,854
"Are are the playful sky?"

1694
02:07:37,736 --> 02:07:42,458
"There's been scintillation
all around the earth"

1695
02:07:42,686 --> 02:07:46,994
"because of you"

1696
02:07:47,506 --> 02:07:52,188
"The Milky way is formed because of me"

1697
02:07:52,471 --> 02:07:56,561
"But it has got a bright
smiling face because of you"
