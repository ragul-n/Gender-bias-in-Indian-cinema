1
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:36,461
We are going so fast.
Aren't you scared?

2
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:38,794
I'm enjoying it aII the more now.
When you are with me...

3
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:41,463
I'm not scared at aII,
In fact, this is great fun!

4
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:45,073
Watch it. You're going
to be reaIIy scared now

5
00:00:56,256 --> 00:00:57,814
What are you Iooking at?

6
00:00:57,924 --> 00:01:00,825
I feeI Iike giving you a kiss.
- So give me a kiss

7
00:01:01,494 --> 00:01:03,485
CIose your eyes first

8
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:06,830
Whenever you give me a kiss,
you make me cIose my eyes

9
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,828
How wiII I know how good
you are at kissing?

10
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:12,836
If you want a good kiss,
you got to cIose your eyes

11
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:34,443
Hey! You've woken up!

12
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:39,425
You speak as if this is the
first time I've ever woken up

13
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:44,158
Because that truck keeps honking away,
I got to wake up earIy every morning

14
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:47,532
Why don't you keep that aIarm cIock
cIose to your own ears?

15
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:50,926
You ought to thank that cIock which
at Ieast wakes you up on time

16
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:54,396
EIse, the whoIe worId wants to fuIfiII
its dreams in the worId of dreams itseIf

17
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:34,072
Hey Maninder...
- Yes sir?

18
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:38,780
Is everything okay?
- We've got to repIace the carburetor

19
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:42,317
Take the carburetor from the new car
and fit it in this one...

20
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:46,685
and fit the oId carburetor in the new car.
- CouId you pIease expIain in detaiI?

21
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:50,656
Sure, I wiII. If you put
the carburetor of that car in this one...

22
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:54,660
this one wiII work fine. And the car
that's here for wheeI-aIignment...

23
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:58,994
wiII soon be back for a repIacement
of the carburetor. You get that?

24
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:01,670
Sure, I do.
- You've understood...

25
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:03,805
but make sure you don't
teII Arav about it

26
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:06,707
That's wonderfuI, Mr Vasvani.
What a con job!

27
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:11,279
We're here to fix cars
and make money

28
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:14,448
So get on with your work.
Don't waste my time. Go on

29
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:19,015
Go! Time is money

30
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:25,027
Hey AIi-bhai...
WeIcome to my garage!

31
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:31,095
Skip the crap! What siIIy jobs you do!
The cars get screwed in just two days

32
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:33,697
Not again?
Here's what I'II do

33
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,635
I'II entrust your car
to the reaI expert this time

34
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:41,036
He has onIy to touch it
and it'II be fine. Okay?

35
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:42,476
Arav...

36
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,644
Have you fixed the car?
- This one can't be repaired

37
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:51,523
It has a manufacturing defect.
Sue the manufacturers...

38
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:54,053
you'II get a new car.
- But how do I know that you're right?

39
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:56,726
What if I get stuck
in a IegaI battIe?

40
00:04:57,063 --> 00:04:59,725
I've never made a faIse cIaim
where cars are concerned

41
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:01,727
Okay? So don't you worry

42
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:17,239
I have faith in my abiIities

43
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:20,075
Just wait and watch. There wiII
come a day...

44
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:24,080
when cars designed by me wiII
zoom across every street of the worId

45
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:27,090
That's tops, I say!
God bIess you!

46
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,891
''Sat Sri AkaI, Papa-ji...''

47
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:32,758
You've wasted so many pages
to write just a singIe Iine?

48
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:37,092
Wasted pages? I'm writing a Ietter
to my foIks, not wasting pages

49
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:39,903
And, by the way, how do you
write a Ietter in just a singIe Iine?

50
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:42,573
I'II show you.
- Go ahead. Let's see

51
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:45,100
Here's the pen. I wanna see

52
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:50,640
''I am fine here...''

53
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:56,912
''and hope the same for you.
Your son, Arav''

54
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:00,122
Is that a Ietter or a teIegram?

55
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:04,519
You won't understand.
Just maiI it to my address

56
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:07,727
You and I just don't think aIike.
- Right!

57
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:12,127
<i>You've come to America so that
you can earn money:::</i>

58
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:14,871
go back to India and settIe down.
- Oh sure, that's spot on

59
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:19,809
But that's not what I want to do.
Why shouId I Ieave the country...

60
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:23,274
that's giving me everything?
Name, fame, progress... why?

61
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:26,608
Don't Ieave it, sir!
Who's asking you to Ieave it?

62
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:29,953
But do teII me something. What happens
of your foIks back home?

63
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:33,158
They'II be fine. My eIder brother
is around to take care of them

64
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:37,159
And once I get settIed here,
they can come here and Iive with me

65
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:58,675
Sir, my designs are truIy innovative
and distinctiveIy a cIass apart

66
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:01,915
I seek your support to gain access to
the research and deveIopment...

67
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,989
department of your principaIs.
- Mr Kapoor, you wiII have to find...

68
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:07,182
aIternative modes to access
the authorities

69
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:09,859
I suggest you send in
your proposaI directIy

70
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:11,886
Thank you

71
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:19,864
Fab job Arav! You have turned
my car into a new one. What did you do?

72
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:22,197
Nothing much, just a few
changes here and there

73
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:27,210
You're so taIented, why don't
you start a workshop of your own?

74
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:29,913
If you say, I'm wiIIing to invest.
- Mr. PateI...

75
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:34,208
you want to throw me out of business?
- Mr PateI...

76
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:37,879
my aim is not the opening of a workshop.
BasicaIIy I'm a car-designer...

77
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:40,817
waiting for the right opportunity.
- And this is the Iand of opportunity!

78
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:43,218
You don't know Mr PateI, Arav

79
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:48,231
He owns 41% of the Iargest chain
of moteIs and restaurants in America

80
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:50,592
<i>He's opening a new discotheque
very soon:::</i>

81
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:56,842
to coincide with his nephew's marriage.
- I hope you guys wiII attend

82
00:07:57,243 --> 00:08:00,235
By the way, Arav, give me
a demo CD of your designs

83
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:02,244
I know a Iot of peopIe
in the car industry

84
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:04,246
AII right, sir.
- I have a piece of advise

85
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:07,318
You ought to visit the gypsy tempIe once
and try your Iuck

86
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:24,933
Look at them rocking!
Shake a Ieg!

87
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,275
It takes IittIe to make a Sardar
break into ajig!

88
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:33,409
You get on with your Iuck!
I'm going to have a bIast!

89
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,729
You can keep this.
I'II take out another one

90
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:56,291
Excuse me. It's not just
another piece of paper

91
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:58,627
We both made a wish
and picked it up

92
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:02,304
Who knows? Maybe God wants both of us
to know the same thing

93
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:08,640
''You'II meet with your destiny today''

94
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:13,312
I can't beIieve this!
Are we each other's destiny?

95
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,311
I don't beIieve in things
Iike destiny

96
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:20,323
We reached the tempIe at the same time,
make a wish and pick up a chit...

97
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:24,653
if aII this can happen,
why can't we be each other's destiny?

98
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:27,831
Because this is just a coincidence
and nothing more

99
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:32,328
It's aII about perception.
What if we meet again?

100
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:34,935
We'II see

101
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:38,668
Hi, I'm Anna.
- I'm Arav. Take care. Bye

102
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,145
Anna! He's so handsome!

103
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:46,610
Straight out of a romantic noveI!

104
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:07,300

105
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,269
''Burn coz its hot

''Love is reaI,
Iove takes time''

113
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:20,810
''Love is sinfuI

114
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:56,144
''Look up at me, my Iove.
Raise your eyes''

115
00:11:56,549 --> 00:12:00,918
''I'm a rare beauty, my Iove''

116
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:03,614
''Take me in your arms,
hoId me to your bosom...''

117
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:06,155
''don't make me pine Iike this''

118
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:08,483
''On my moon-Iike face,

119
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:11,092
''embeIIish my beauty
with pearIs and diamonds''

120
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:13,328
''Drape me in a sari

''You have married me...

''Watch me,
undercover cops can't stop me''

123
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:28,171
''Gonna Iock you down
with my Iock and key''

124
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:32,950
''Cause you couId be Punjabi,
Gujarati, Parsi or a banging BengaIi''

125
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:51,964
''Youth is but shortIived, my Iove''

126
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:56,941
''I just can't wait anymore''

127

''They drive me crazy''

136
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:38,016
''They're others who dance
to your tunes, O pretty one''

137
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:42,987
''They're others who do up
your hair-bun''

138
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:47,252
''I'm one of those who don't

I'm waiting for a compIiment too

155
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:08,663
Oh! So you are a shy guy by nature

156
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:12,475
Anyway, this is our second meeting.
Do you think it's destiny?

157
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:15,476
Mere happenstance

158
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,072
There are just a handfuI of Indians
in this city...

159
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:21,219
who keep bumping into each other
on festive occasions

160
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:25,284
It'II be a mistake to caII it destiny.

161
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:28,288
There are hundreds of thousands of peopIe
in this city

162
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:33,131
So, our meeting again has definiteIy
got something to do with destiny

163
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:37,692
Suit yourseIf with whatever beIiefs.
- His beIief, not mine

164
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:40,699
You'II sureIy accept it some day.
- WeII, it's that...

165
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:44,699
Wow! Friends aIready?

166
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:48,036
Nothing of the sort. Just a
coincidence that we've met again

167
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:53,718
My word! You need good-fortune for
such coincidences, my friend!

168
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:55,142
Bye!

169
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:03,323
Dammit! What wrong have I done?
- I was trying hard to shake her off...

170
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:05,720
and Iike an idiot,
you took up for her!

171
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:11,726
What a nut! You don't try to
shake off gaIs Iike her!

172
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:14,901
You ought to be chasing her!

173
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:22,738
Anna, he shouId be crazy about you,
but he's just not encouraging you!

174
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:28,182
Nams, some guys Iike it sIow.
- Yeah

175
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:32,754
Even I Iike it.
This is the way... sIow!

176
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:36,752
But not so sIow as to get oId
and procIaim one day...

177
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,921
''DarIing, I Iove you''

178
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:45,428
Nams, he might not agree
with me today...

179
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:49,831
but one day he'II sureIy reaIise
that I'm his destiny

180
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:55,312
That trip to the tempIe
and our second meeting...

181
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:57,909
things Iike these don't happen
every other day

182
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:01,112
I'm just waiting for
our next meeting

183
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,789
There must sureIy be something that
wiII bring us cIose to each other

184
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:16,264
Excuse me. Can I test-drive this car?
- Sorry, sir. It's onIy for dispIay

185
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:20,397
Can I check the interiors?
- With pIeasure. AII yours

186
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:29,478
You...? Here?
- I am, wherever you are

187
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:35,243
I'm sure you think this is
a coincidence too

188
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:39,816
ActuaIIy I am very fond of cars

189
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:43,826
WeII, cars are my Iife,
my passion... my destiny

190
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:48,322
Destiny? Cars? So we do have
something in common

191
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:52,497
It was nice taIking to you.
See you again...

192
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:54,635
if there is a coincidence

193
00:17:56,175 --> 00:18:00,578
BeIieve me, my destiny wiII sureIy bring
us together again. By a coincidence

194
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:14,119
This car was Iaunched onIy today
and you've bought it aIready?

195
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:16,858
I haven't bought it,
I'm just taking a test- drive

196
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:20,860
When I asked for it, I was turned down.
How come you got it?

197
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,464
I'm weII connected, you see?
You want a Iift?

198
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:29,363
What are you so thoughtfuI about?
C'mon!

199
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:35,873
You are such a weirdo. Guys pray to
get a Iift from a beautifuI girI...

200
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:39,873
and you are acting pricey.
- Okay

201
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:49,554
Do me a favour, pIease.
- What?

202
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:52,227
Give me my bag Iying back there

203
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:58,226
Here you are.
- Open it

204
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,897
Excuse me, it's very unsafe
to open a Iady's purse

205
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:04,338
You won't be embarrassed. Open it

206
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:09,103
Done.
- So give it to me

207
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:11,780
Give you what?
- Give me the scarf in the bag!

208
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:14,644
I can't see anything. Hurry up.
- Here you are

209
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:19,918
What on earth are you doing...?

210
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:22,255
We'II end up having a coIIision
whiIe you're tying up your hair!

211
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:24,725
God! Here's a harassed girI...

212
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,525
instead of heIping her,
you're yeIIing at her?

213
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,333
Can't you simpIy tie up my hair.
Go on now. Do it

214
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:35,266
Are you serious?
- Tie it up, I can't see a thing!

215
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:48,342
What are you doing? Tie it up!
- As if I've done a course in this!

216
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:53,955
Sit stiII, wiII you?

217
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,756
Tie it up properIy

218
00:19:57,963 --> 00:19:59,954
Thank you.
- You're weIcome

219
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,627
This is fun!

220
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:12,303
Amazing body!
- It takes years for a body Iike this

221
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:16,307
I can see that. But I've never
seen a shape Iike this one

222
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:23,385
And this coIour... it's a kiIIer!

223
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:26,784
I wish I couId have it right now.
- What?

224
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:30,994
This car. I Iove its aerodynamics

225
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:37,433
Arav, what's your profession?
- I am a car designer

226
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:41,600
If I get the opportunity, I couId
design a better car than this one

227
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:46,267
Anyway, you can drop me here

228
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:59,717
When are we going to meet again?
- Whenever your destiny wants us to

229
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:01,690
Take care. Bye

230
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:10,028
My Iaptop!

231
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:15,802
Hey Arav! CongratuIations!

232
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:22,044
There's an urgent interview
caII for you from BMW

233
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:24,915
AII the best, my friend.
- CongratuIations!

234
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,808
I won't be abIe to appear
for this interview

235
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:28,614
Why not?
- What's the matter?

236
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:31,846
I forgot my Iaptop in Anna's car.
- So caII Anna and have it brought here

237
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:34,721
I don't have her number.
- But you have her address?

238
00:21:34,827 --> 00:21:36,488
Let's go and fetch it.
- I don't have her address either

239
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:39,086
She was giving it to me, but...
- You mean, you didn't take it?

240
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,493
God AImighty! When's this guy
going to have some common sense?

241
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:44,500
Guess what? You gave
a demo CD to PateI, right?

242
00:21:44,937 --> 00:21:48,998
So I'II caII PateI and have that CD
rushed back. SimpIe

243
00:21:53,012 --> 00:21:55,003
I hope I don't mess up
this opportunity

244
00:21:57,383 --> 00:22:00,511
PateI's ceIIphone is switched off.
But don't worry, Arav

245
00:22:00,853 --> 00:22:03,117
CD or no CD,
you must go for the interview

246
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:11,854
Mr Arav Kapoor, we at BMW beIieve that
new taIent has to be promoted...

247
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:15,193
and in keeping with this tradition
we have invited you here today

248
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:19,228
I'm very gratefuI, sir, but
the thing is... I have a probIem

249
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:23,631
I Iost my Iaptop yesterday, so I won't
be abIe to show you the designs...

250
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:26,538
and the demos I have made.
- But we have aIready have your demo CD

251
00:22:28,481 --> 00:22:33,350
We have gone through your designs
and the opinion of my paneI is that...

252
00:22:33,619 --> 00:22:37,953
it's very impressive. So we have
decided to give you a go-ahead

253
00:22:38,324 --> 00:22:40,315
WeIcome to BMW.
- Thank you so much

254
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:46,360
The administrative officer wiII
introduce you to your work-station...

255
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:48,462
as weII as your personaI assistant

256
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:55,039
Hi Arav.
- What are you doing here?

257
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,365
CaII it a coincidence

258
00:22:57,977 --> 00:23:00,241
By a quirk of destiny,
I happen to be your assistant

259
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:03,241
Oh, now I see.
You showed them my Iaptop

260
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:07,174
A coincidence. You forgot
your Iaptop in my car...

261
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:15,857
and when I Iooked into it for
your address, I discovered a genius

262
00:23:20,032 --> 00:23:22,023
The rest, you know

263
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:26,594
I don't know how
to thank you Anna

264
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:29,864
You've made my dream come true

265
00:23:31,877 --> 00:23:36,143
You deserve it.
So now do you beIieve in destiny?

266
00:23:36,682 --> 00:23:40,118
Maybe not in destiny, but yes...
I have started beIieving in you

267
00:23:46,659 --> 00:23:48,217
''He Ioves me...?''

268
00:23:48,561 --> 00:23:50,153
''He Ioves me not''

269
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:52,023
''He Ioves me!''

270
00:23:53,132 --> 00:23:59,367
''When you Iose your heart
to someone...''

271
00:24:00,239 --> 00:24:02,639
''you're on the horns
of a diIemma''

272
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:09,808
''O my Iove... I hope
I don't faII in Iove''

273
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:23,084
''When you Iose your heart
to someone...''

274
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,454
''you're on the horns
of a diIemma''

275
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:33,830
''O my Iove... I hope
I don't faII in Iove''

276
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:49,078
''I hope I'm not bowIed over
by her charms''

277
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:55,612
''I hope I don't find myseIf
Iost in her eyes''

278
00:25:56,422 --> 00:26:02,952
''I hope I do not err...''

279
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:09,757
''my heart knows not what anguish
Iove causes''

280
00:26:10,803 --> 00:26:16,935
''When you Iose your heart
to someone...''

281
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:20,378
''it's oh so difficuIt''

282
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:27,210
''O my Iove... I hope
I don't faII in Iove''

283
00:27:12,064 --> 00:27:18,162
''What intoxication
Ieads me astray...?''

284
00:27:19,071 --> 00:27:25,271
''what fragrance
my IoveIy memories exude?''

285
00:27:25,878 --> 00:27:32,408
''Never was I in such a state...''

286
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:39,518
''what desires now consume my heart?''

287
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:46,360
''When you Iose your heart
to someone...''

288
00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:49,865
''it's oh so difficuIt''

289
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:56,865
''O my Iove... I hope
I don't faII in Iove''

290
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:10,512
''When you Iose your heart
to someone...''

291
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:17,895
''you're on the horns
of a diIemma''

292
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:38,245
''It's difficuIt...
oh so difficuIt''

293
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:45,254
''It's difficuIt...
oh so difficuIt''

294
00:28:49,528 --> 00:28:53,589
Nams! I'm in Iove!
I'm in Iove!

295
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:57,595
Madam, you've taken Arav
for your Iife-partner

296
00:28:58,003 --> 00:29:02,372
But isn't it necessary to find out
whether he's your type at aII?

297
00:29:02,975 --> 00:29:06,467
Yes, you are right!
But how do we find out?

298
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:08,640
SimpIe, Iet's ask him

299
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:12,474
Stupid, as if I'd ask and he'd
teII me. It's not so easy

300
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:15,283
You're right.
What shouId we do then?

301
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:17,953
Got it!

302
00:29:20,626 --> 00:29:23,959
Anna! What happened?

303
00:29:26,064 --> 00:29:27,759
Did you find out...?

304
00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:30,696
So teII me!

305
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:33,563
PIease Anna! TeII me!
- Okay

306
00:29:35,407 --> 00:29:39,138
The company's procedures. AII empIoyees
have to go through a psychoanaIysis test

307
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:40,978
What's that?

308
00:29:42,648 --> 00:29:45,981
PsychoanaIysis.
- What on earth is that?

309
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:50,380
The company wants to know
what kind of a person you are...

310
00:29:50,656 --> 00:29:52,647
your Iikes and disIikes and so on

311
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:56,493
Everybody's got to do it.
Take a Iook at this

312
00:29:58,297 --> 00:29:59,992
Okay. Shoot

313
00:30:16,715 --> 00:30:17,704
The question?

314
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:24,287
Sure. What are you fond of?
- I'm fond of food

315
00:30:25,057 --> 00:30:29,357
I don't know how to cook.
- Stupid! What are cookery books for?

316
00:30:30,429 --> 00:30:33,523
I Iove Chinese, Lebanese, Mexican,
ItaIian, Thai...

317
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:39,026
but nothing to beat
our spicy Indian food

318
00:30:40,105 --> 00:30:46,044
Butter chicken, cottage-cheese
cooked in butter and IentiI-curry!

319
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:51,044
They say, the way to a man's heart
is through his stomach

320
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:55,614
Isn't that a rather odd route?
- But guys Iove aII the odd routes!

321
00:30:56,555 --> 00:30:58,523
ShouId I Iet you into
something personaI?

322
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:01,052
Promise me you won't Iaugh.
- I won't

323
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:04,527
Sure? Promise?
- Yes

324
00:31:08,734 --> 00:31:13,398
I Iove watching cartoons.
- Cartoons! At your age!

325
00:31:15,073 --> 00:31:16,062
Sorry

326
00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:23,414
Give me a big box of buttered popcorns
and my favorite cartoons

327
00:31:23,749 --> 00:31:27,082
Tom and Jerry, Scooby Doo, Batman,
Spiderman, Tin Tin, Richie Rich...

328
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:29,080
and so on

329
00:31:39,131 --> 00:31:40,428
So cute!

330
00:31:42,167 --> 00:31:45,432
What is your sexuaIity?
- What?!

331
00:31:46,505 --> 00:31:52,535
I mean, are you bi, hetro,
metro, tetro...?

332
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:54,271
what...?

333
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:59,709
WeII, I'm happy and gay.
- What?!

334
00:32:03,622 --> 00:32:07,615
Why do aII the guys with such
good quaIities turn out to be gay?

335
00:32:11,463 --> 00:32:12,930
I was onIy kidding

336
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:14,291
Thank God!

337
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:18,729
What wouId you gift
your girIfriend on a date?

338
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:23,574
How does that concern the company?
That's my personaI Iife!

339
00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:27,805
That's preciseIy why I'm asking you.
To know more about you

340
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:31,578
I'm asking you stuff from the
questionnaire. Take a Iook, if you wish

341
00:32:32,084 --> 00:32:33,676
Let me see

342
00:32:34,486 --> 00:32:36,477
Okay, go ahead

343
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:42,757
What gift wouId you give her?
A bouquet of fIowers...

344
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:46,688
or an expensive pIatinum
neckIace studded with diamonds...

345
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:50,328
or something that your
girIfriend is reaIIy fond of?

346
00:32:51,236 --> 00:32:56,503
I won't gift her any of these.
I'II gift my girIfriend a cactus pIant

347
00:32:57,175 --> 00:32:58,164
Cactus!

348
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:03,739
FIowers can wiIt.
Expensive gifts can be stoIen

349
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:08,849
But not the cactus. We use the cactus
for the security of our homes...

350
00:33:09,287 --> 00:33:12,188
and a cactus wiII aIways
remind my girIfriend...

351
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:15,187
that if anyone ever tries
to act smart with her...

352
00:33:15,627 --> 00:33:17,993
I'm going to smash his...

353
00:33:22,534 --> 00:33:26,300
Fantastic!
UnimaginabIy romantic!

354
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:31,202
He's just my type.
Arav was made onIy for me

355
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:39,609
Coffee?

356
00:33:42,287 --> 00:33:44,881
Know something? That's just
what I was thinking about

357
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:48,624
And you said it.
- So I can read your mind

358
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:51,218
I'II go and get it.
- Okay

359
00:33:56,568 --> 00:33:58,559
Young man, it's Friday night

360
00:33:59,237 --> 00:34:02,570
When aII your friends are enjoying
the week-end with their famiIies...

361
00:34:03,275 --> 00:34:06,244
why're you stiII working?
- Sir, this is not just work for me

362
00:34:06,578 --> 00:34:10,742
It's my very Iife. If you don't
mind, may I ask you something?

363
00:34:11,917 --> 00:34:14,852
Yes?
- Why are you working so Iate?

364
00:34:16,655 --> 00:34:20,250
It's Iike this, son. I happen
to be the Chairman of this company

365
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:26,931
This huge empire you now see
was once a dream I so cherished

366
00:34:27,866 --> 00:34:31,267
Like you, I too want to reach
these heights of success, sir

367
00:34:34,272 --> 00:34:38,072
Very ambitious boy. What's your name?

368
00:34:38,276 --> 00:34:43,543
Nice meeting you. I can see that our

369
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:45,715
God bIess you

00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:24,186
CongratuIations, Arav!
- Thank you!

371
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:28,625
It's because of you that
I was abIe to taste success today

372
00:35:29,261 --> 00:35:31,320
You were the first one to spot my taIent.

373
00:35:31,663 --> 00:35:34,826
Arav, some peopIe make
such a name for themseIves...

374
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:38,325
that the worId
remembers them forever

375
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:42,333
I'm sure you are one of them.
- You have so much of faith in me?

376
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:48,341
Yes, I do. And you owe me a treat.
- I'II fuIfiII aII your wishes today

377
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,944
First things first.
Let's go and party

378
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,138
Okay

379
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:01,621
C'mon guys!
Cheers!

380
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:10,090

00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:30,183

00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:34,848
I'm so happy... I'II go mad!

387
00:36:35,393 --> 00:36:37,987
What happened? WiII you teII us?
- Mr. Virvani just caIIed

388
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:42,833
My car is being Iaunched, Anna!
- This is great news!

389
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:27,434
Why are you Iooking at me Iike that?

390
00:37:27,779 --> 00:37:31,772
I've been so immersed in my work...

391
00:37:33,718 --> 00:37:37,882
I reaIise today how beautifuI you are

392
00:37:39,524 --> 00:37:41,890
I'm gIad you've reaIised it at Iast

393
00:37:44,896 --> 00:37:46,887
I've aIso come to reaIise...

394
00:37:51,136 --> 00:37:55,334

I Iove you, Anna

395
00:37:57,542 --> 00:37:59,476
I Iove you too

396
00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:17,157
The function has started.
Why isn't Anna here yet?

397
00:38:17,429 --> 00:38:19,659
A girI needs time to get ready.
So be patient

398
00:38:20,832 --> 00:38:22,493
Hey Arav, congratuIations!

399
00:38:22,834 --> 00:38:25,166
Isn't this the moment you've
aIways waited for?

400
00:38:44,923 --> 00:38:47,187
Arav, Mr Virvani wants to see you
in his chambers

401
00:38:50,528 --> 00:38:52,052
May I come in, sir?

402
00:38:54,132 --> 00:38:58,068
Arav, this is the most
expensive city in the worId...

403
00:38:59,637 --> 00:39:02,197
and this is the most expensive
piece of Iand in the city...

404
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:06,067
where our office is situated

405
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:10,537
This company thrives on hardwork
and inteIIigence...

406
00:39:11,549 --> 00:39:15,212
but Iife feeds
on Iove and emotions

407
00:39:17,889 --> 00:39:24,556
I Iost my son and daughter-in-Iaw
in a car accident

408
00:39:26,598 --> 00:39:32,559
Everything was finished for me.
But thank God...

409
00:39:32,904 --> 00:39:34,895
my granddaughter Anna survived

410
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:41,377
Anna means everything to me

411
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:45,643
I've given her everything
she has ever asked for in Iife

412
00:39:46,651 --> 00:39:50,587
Today she has chosen you
as her Iife-partner...

413
00:39:51,656 --> 00:39:57,595
she Ioves you a Iot and I am sure
you reciprocate her feeIing

414
00:39:58,663 --> 00:40:01,097
Sir, I Iove her too.
- But mind you...

415
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:07,094
when I see Anna shedding tears...
I Iose aII controI

416
00:40:08,606 --> 00:40:10,938
I can never forgive someone
who hurts Anna

417
00:40:11,142 --> 00:40:13,133
Sir, she'II aIways be happy with me

418
00:40:25,223 --> 00:40:31,753
Ladies and gentIemen, Iet me have

00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:10,845
''don't waIk away,

431
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:16,324
''My heart bears a burden,
it's difficuIt to rein it in...''

432
00:43:16,728 --> 00:43:20,721
''I impIore you, do not
smiIe teasingIy Iike this''

433
00:43:21,366 --> 00:43:23,334
''Don't twist my wrist...''

434
00:43:23,701 --> 00:43:30,334
''Goodness!
Don't pester me Iike this''

435
00:43:30,775 --> 00:43:35,007
''Someone might see us,
what wiII he have to say...?''

436
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:39,282
''Stop teasing me... go away''

437
00:43:44,355 --> 00:43:49,019
''As many times as I

441
00:44:50,788 --> 00:44:54,849
''what's happening to me,
IittIe do I know''

442
00:44:55,426 --> 00:44:59,863
''You are the one I desire,
you are the one I Iove...''

443
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:04,231
''whatever anyone has to say''

444
00:45:04,769 --> 00:45:09,172
''Your enticing kohI,

445
00:45:09,541 --> 00:45:13,978
''your shy gaze that

446
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:19,041

We're home.

452
00:46:18,243 --> 00:46:20,939
Don't you want to go in?
- No!

453
00:46:22,513 --> 00:46:25,004
It's said that men change
after the wedding

454
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:28,513
But you won't change, wiII you?
- Never

455
00:46:30,121 --> 00:46:34,956
You'II forever hoId me in your arms?
- Forever

456
00:46:35,426 --> 00:46:38,327
And who'II design the cars?

457
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:41,259
Want me to teII you?
- Yes

458
00:46:41,532 --> 00:46:45,195
Come here, I'II teII you.
- Hey, what are you doing?

459
00:46:45,436 --> 00:46:47,700
Don't move.
This is my Iaptop. Okay?

460
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:50,530
I'II now switch it on

461
00:46:52,210 --> 00:46:53,700
What are you doing?
Have you gone mad?

462
00:46:53,878 --> 00:46:56,870
Hang on, my Iaptop wiII
faII down, stop moving

463
00:46:57,415 --> 00:46:59,280
I'm now going to make my designs.
Okay?

464
00:47:01,886 --> 00:47:04,548
You're tickIing me! Let me go!
- You'II ruin my designs!

465
00:47:04,922 --> 00:47:06,753
Let me go!

466
00:47:07,558 --> 00:47:11,551
Cheat! You'd forget to step on the
brakes whiIe you're at the designs

467
00:47:12,563 --> 00:47:18,991
Stop teasing me, baby! PIease Iet go!
- Know something?

468
00:47:20,571 --> 00:47:22,562
I Iove the way you say baby

469
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:30,913
I wanna record your voice and
make it my ring tone. Say something

470
00:47:31,649 --> 00:47:35,983
Hi baby, Anna here.
Hi baby, Anna here!

471
00:47:39,691 --> 00:47:42,592
Now wherever I go,
I'II carry your voice with me

472
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:46,387
ReIish the mangoes...
- PoIishing off the mangoes, eh?

473
00:47:46,597 --> 00:47:48,326
Have one, my friend

474
00:47:50,601 --> 00:47:52,592
It's your house the mangoes
have arrived from

475
00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:55,603
They're absoIuteIy fantastic!

476
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,270
Oh yes, there's aIso a Ietter for you

477
00:48:25,803 --> 00:48:29,637
Baby, why do you sound so worried?

478
00:48:29,874 --> 00:48:31,637
Anna, I have to Ieave
for India immediateIy

479
00:48:31,876 --> 00:48:34,367
But what for?
- My dad is not weII

480
00:48:35,947 --> 00:48:37,938
Is he okay?
- I've no idea

481
00:48:38,649 --> 00:48:41,641
QuickIy pack your stuff,
I'II drop you at the airport

482
00:48:42,053 --> 00:48:44,317
I'm aIready there.
My fIight Ieaves in 30 minutes

483
00:48:45,656 --> 00:48:47,988
Okay! CaII me once you reach there.

484
00:48:48,493 --> 00:48:49,482
Okay, baby

485
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:53,454
I'II miss you.
- I'II miss you too. Take care

486
00:48:53,865 --> 00:48:55,662
Come back soon.
- Bye

487
00:49:35,373 --> 00:49:42,711
''Do come now, my sweetheart...''

488
00:49:43,047 --> 00:49:46,380
''come and see what
state I've been in''

489
00:49:50,755 --> 00:49:54,191
''Come, give me a hug...''

490
00:49:54,659 --> 00:49:58,060
''I'm yearning to see you''

491
00:50:51,816 --> 00:50:55,582
''I can't teII you
how much I've Ioved you''

492
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:59,351
''You are the one I have
awaited every moment''

493
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:03,248
''Awake or asIeep...''

494
00:51:03,794 --> 00:51:07,787
''yours were the memories
I was aIways immersed in''

495
00:51:22,813 --> 00:51:26,374
''Parted from you, my Iove...''

496
00:51:26,817 --> 00:51:30,150
''I've been through heII''

497
00:51:38,462 --> 00:51:41,454
''Do come now, my sweetheart...''

498
00:51:42,033 --> 00:51:45,833
''come and see what
state I've been in''

499
00:52:31,983 --> 00:52:35,544
''Ever since I've received
word from you, sweetheart...''

500
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:39,412
''I've been on a strange high''

501
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:43,485
''I can't spend my time,
however hard I try...''

502
00:52:43,828 --> 00:52:47,286
''your face just doesn't
meIt of my sight''

503
00:53:02,913 --> 00:53:06,371
''This good news, my Iove...''

504
00:53:06,717 --> 00:53:10,244
''has awakened a pining''

505
00:53:17,928 --> 00:53:21,591
''Do come now, my sweetheart...''

506
00:53:21,999 --> 00:53:25,435
''come and see what
state I've been in''

507
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:32,932
''Come, give me a hug...''

508
00:53:33,377 --> 00:53:37,609
''I'm yearning to see you''

509
00:53:42,953 --> 00:53:45,285
''We are going so fast.
Aren't you scared?''

510
00:53:45,556 --> 00:53:47,615
''When you are with me,
I'm not scared at aII''

511
00:53:47,958 --> 00:53:49,755
''In fact, this is great fun!''

512
00:53:58,502 --> 00:54:01,562
TeII me something, Arav.
Do you Iike KajaI?

513
00:54:01,906 --> 00:54:07,401
I do, grandma.
- And KajaI? Do you Iike Arav?

514
00:54:08,045 --> 00:54:09,774
He's the onIy one I Iike, grandma

515
00:54:10,014 --> 00:54:14,383
Why don't we ask Arav's parents
to Iet him stay with us?

516
00:54:14,985 --> 00:54:18,512
And if I send you away to Arav's pIace?
- That's fine with me!

517
00:54:18,989 --> 00:54:21,583
Oh no. If I'II go away,
who wiII take care of you?

518
00:54:22,026 --> 00:54:23,994
WeII, weII.
I never thought of that

519
00:54:24,328 --> 00:54:26,592
Greetings.
- Greetings

520
00:54:27,431 --> 00:54:30,423
Now teII me something.
What do you think of my KajaI?

521
00:54:31,335 --> 00:54:34,998
Not just me, our whoIe famiIy
Iikes her a Iot. Come here, my chiId

522
00:54:36,006 --> 00:54:38,804
Thank God.
Everybody Ioves my KajaI

523
00:54:39,443 --> 00:54:41,502
But why are you asking aII this?

524
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:46,010
I need to ask the opinion of
her prospective in- Iaws, right?

525
00:54:46,417 --> 00:54:50,012
They are stiII very young. Let them
grow up. There's a Iot of time

526
00:54:50,387 --> 00:54:54,380
They have time, but I don't

527
00:54:55,192 --> 00:55:01,028
I am the onIy one she has.
If something happens to me...

528
00:55:01,432 --> 00:55:05,698
Don't worry aunty.
I give you my word...

529
00:55:06,137 --> 00:55:09,129
KajaI wiII sureIy become
the daughter-in-Iaw of our famiIy

530
00:55:16,046 --> 00:55:18,844
Oh yes!
KajaI, kiss this stone, wiII you?

531
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:31,857
You've got a great aim

532
00:55:32,062 --> 00:55:34,622
No, it's your kiss
that does the trick

533
00:55:38,269 --> 00:55:42,069
Guess why we Iove each other so much?
- Why?

534
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:46,742
Because we eat from the same pIate.
It's supposed to make our Iove stronger

535
00:55:47,077 --> 00:55:49,671
And when it makes Iove stronger,
you get married

536
00:55:50,114 --> 00:55:53,606
I see. No wonder grandma
was taIking about our marriage

537
00:55:54,118 --> 00:55:56,882
But I am going away to boarding schooI.
- So what?

538
00:55:57,087 --> 00:55:58,884
You'II be back during
the vacations, won't you?

539
00:55:58,989 --> 00:56:01,685
No, I'II study for the next year
during the vacations

540
00:56:02,092 --> 00:56:04,083
So you're going to forget me?

541
00:56:04,595 --> 00:56:07,894
I'm onIy going to study,
not to forget you

542
00:56:12,036 --> 00:56:14,766
We're wasting our time.
These trees wiII die

543
00:56:15,105 --> 00:56:17,096
SapIings pIanted in the rains
don't ever die

544
00:56:17,441 --> 00:56:21,104
Even if you forget me, these trees
wiII remind you of me

545
00:56:21,579 --> 00:56:23,103
BIess you, son

546
00:56:25,249 --> 00:56:26,238
Grandma!

547
00:56:28,786 --> 00:56:30,777
Go on, son. Put aII your heart
into your studies

548
00:56:30,988 --> 00:56:32,979
You won't forget me once you've
become a successfuI engineer, wiII you?

549
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:35,454
No, grandma.
I'II never forget you

550
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:39,120
Bye, KajaI.
- Sweets for you

551
00:56:39,496 --> 00:56:42,556
He's not going away forever, my dear.
It's just a matter of a few days

552
00:56:43,133 --> 00:56:46,125
No grandma, it's a matter of years

553
00:56:46,537 --> 00:56:48,528
Don't worry, these years
wiII pass very soon

554
00:56:51,442 --> 00:56:55,139
CongratuIations, Arav. You've topped
the exams in the whoIe coIIege

555
00:56:55,546 --> 00:56:57,741
You'II easiIy get ajob
in any automobiIe company

556
00:56:58,082 --> 00:57:00,573
But I want to go to America for further
studies and design top Iine cars there

557
00:57:01,151 --> 00:57:04,746
My visa and tickets have arrived.
I'm Ieaving in 48 hours

558
00:57:05,089 --> 00:57:07,148
You mean, you are directIy
going to the airport from here?

559
00:57:07,491 --> 00:57:12,394
No, I'II go home first. So much
must've changed in ten years

560
00:57:13,330 --> 00:57:16,629
I got to know of it onIy through
Ietters earIier. I'II get to see it now

561
00:57:16,967 --> 00:57:19,834
Now Iook, Arav, I have no objection
to your going away to America

562
00:57:20,271 --> 00:57:23,172
But before you go,
you'II have to marry KajaI

563
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:25,838
Marry! There's no way
I am getting married

564
00:57:26,343 --> 00:57:27,970
But why not?

565
00:57:28,178 --> 00:57:31,170
Papa, I've got to compIete my
M.Tech and settIe down

566
00:57:31,615 --> 00:57:33,776
That couId take 6 months
or even 6 years!

567
00:57:34,184 --> 00:57:36,175
Yes dad, Arav is right

568
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:38,181
If he's sixty by the time
he settIes down...

569
00:57:38,355 --> 00:57:39,982
are we going to get him married
as an oId fossiI?

570
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:43,318
Marriage isn't just a formaIity,
it comes with a Iot of responsibiIities

571
00:57:43,894 --> 00:57:46,692
I've yet to stand on my own two feet,
and you want me to carry another burden?

572
00:57:48,198 --> 00:57:50,860
Daughters and daughters-in-Iaw
are not a burden on the famiIy

573
00:57:51,535 --> 00:57:54,527
Mom! How am I going to
make you see reason?

574
00:57:55,439 --> 00:57:58,602
I'm not mentaIIy prepared yet
to marry KajaI

575
00:57:58,943 --> 00:58:04,381
Great! I never knew you had to be
mentaIIy prepared to get married!

576
00:58:05,115 --> 00:58:06,810
Why don't you understand
my probIem, Dad?

577
00:58:06,951 --> 00:58:10,944
PIease, Papa.
Marriage is a bond...

578
00:58:11,121 --> 00:58:14,215
where two peopIe come together to spend
the rest of their Iives with each other

579
00:58:14,458 --> 00:58:18,622
That's true, Papa. KajaI has been
waiting for Arav for ten years

580
00:58:19,229 --> 00:58:22,790
It's better if we Iet her and Arav
take a decision on their own

581
00:58:25,336 --> 00:58:27,327
You've changed so much, Arav

582
00:58:28,272 --> 00:58:30,570
Everything changes
with time, KajaI

583
00:58:31,575 --> 00:58:34,772
Men change, so does
their thought-process

584
00:58:37,848 --> 00:58:44,981
Now Iook at this sun. It rises in the
morning and Iights up the whoIe worId...

585
00:58:46,256 --> 00:58:48,247
but set it does,
every evening.

586
00:58:48,625 --> 00:58:50,616
That's what we think, Arav

587
00:58:52,262 --> 00:58:56,255
The Sun never sets,
it just hides itseIf from us

588
00:58:57,701 --> 00:58:59,931
And we fooI ourseIves
that it has set

589
00:59:01,271 --> 00:59:04,104
KajaI, I reaIIy thought that even if
my parents don't understand me...

590
00:59:04,274 --> 00:59:06,708
you reaIIy wiII, because you've
known me since our chiIdhood

591
00:59:07,077 --> 00:59:09,068
That's preciseIy why
I don't understand you

592
00:59:09,279 --> 00:59:11,611
EspeciaIIy because I have known you
since our chiIdhood

593
00:59:12,282 --> 00:59:15,718
You are the onIy one
I've ever truIy known

594
00:59:18,288 --> 00:59:20,722
I stiII think of you
as my same oId Arav

595
00:59:21,325 --> 00:59:23,623
KajaI, I want to make a
few things very cIear to you

596
00:59:24,294 --> 00:59:26,626
It's true that we spent
some great moments together...

597
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:31,299
but now I neither have any
memories nor any Ionging for them

598
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:34,560
You might not, but I do

599
00:59:36,407 --> 00:59:39,843
Love onIy gets deeper with time

600
00:59:41,345 --> 00:59:44,314
Why don't you understand? I don't
want to be tied down in reIationships

601
00:59:46,650 --> 00:59:48,641
Ten years is a Iong time, Arav

602
00:59:49,987 --> 00:59:53,923
But how they went by,
one couIdn't even reaIise

603
00:59:55,392 --> 00:59:57,326
But Grandma doesn't have much time

604
00:59:58,896 --> 01:00:04,801
See if you can convince her, I've
got used to Iiving with memories anyway

605
01:00:07,137 --> 01:00:10,334
My son, I'm counting my days

606
01:00:13,277 --> 01:00:15,939
I want to see KajaI married
before I die

607
01:00:17,815 --> 01:00:21,683
Accept my daughter, Arav.
PIease marry KajaI

608
01:00:23,353 --> 01:00:25,150
Once she's married...

609
01:00:25,355 --> 01:00:29,348
I can teII her parents that I've
come after fuIfiIIing my duties

610
01:00:35,365 --> 01:00:39,859
''A traditionaI North Indian wedding''

611
01:00:59,523 --> 01:01:01,889
I want to see you
as a successfuI man

612
01:01:03,393 --> 01:01:07,386
The day you reach the dizzy heights
of success you want to scaIe...

613
01:01:09,199 --> 01:01:11,190
we can have our nuptiaIs

614
01:01:14,404 --> 01:01:16,395
I'II wait for that moment, Arav

615
01:02:27,411 --> 01:02:29,276
What a co-incidence Arav

616
01:02:30,013 --> 01:02:34,211
It was raining the day you Ieft...

617
01:02:34,952 --> 01:02:40,015
and today when you have returned,
it's raining again

618
01:02:43,427 --> 01:02:45,292
I've no interest in this rain today

619
01:02:47,898 --> 01:02:49,889
I've come onIy to meet you

620
01:02:53,070 --> 01:02:55,061
OnIy to meet me...?

621
01:02:56,573 --> 01:03:01,033
By saying that, you've given me
the best gift of my Iife

622
01:03:03,513 --> 01:03:07,506
Today even if you ask me for my Iife,
I'd give it to you with a smiIe

623
01:03:10,454 --> 01:03:12,319
I don't need your Iife, KajaI

624
01:03:12,856 --> 01:03:15,518
Then what is it that
you want Arav? What?

625
01:03:33,543 --> 01:03:34,874
Divorce?

626
01:03:37,449 --> 01:03:40,282
I stiII can't beIieve that Arav
couId do a thing Iike this

627
01:03:41,287 --> 01:03:45,621
I thought he had come back to
either stay or to take you aIong

628
01:03:47,293 --> 01:03:51,525
I too beIieved that my Arav
had come back to me

629
01:03:53,899 --> 01:03:59,462
Not even in my dreams couId I imagine
that he wouId come here for a divorce

630
01:04:00,039 --> 01:04:04,476
No, KajaI. Nobody's going to Iet him
break our house Iike this

631
01:04:05,010 --> 01:04:09,344
Dad, Mom, my husband...
nobody's going to support him

632
01:04:09,682 --> 01:04:11,309
Wait tiII I go and teII everyone

633
01:04:13,352 --> 01:04:19,985
Pressurising him might get me
the status of his wife...

634
01:04:20,659 --> 01:04:22,650
but I won't ever get his Iove

635
01:04:23,429 --> 01:04:25,420
So what are we going to do?

636
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:30,999
Arav Iives in every memory
I have of my chiIdhood

637
01:04:33,272 --> 01:04:36,332
If distance has
made Arav forget his Iove...

638
01:04:37,309 --> 01:04:39,641
then I onIy have to remind him of it

639
01:04:43,015 --> 01:04:45,813
I'II remind him of our Iove

640
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:55,718
I'II remind him of our past.
I'II win him over again

641
01:04:58,197 --> 01:05:00,188
I am with you

642
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:06,028
Promise me that this wiII remain
a secret between you and me

643
01:05:17,049 --> 01:05:19,040
Damn! No network signaIs!

644
01:05:32,731 --> 01:05:34,722
Good morning, Arav.
- Good morning, sis- in- Iaw

645
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:37,862
So what's cooking?
- Your favourite. Porridge

646
01:05:38,370 --> 01:05:43,672
KajaI toId me how much you Iove it.
- My favourite? What's my favourite?

647
01:05:44,143 --> 01:05:47,579
Funny! You don't even remember
your favourite dish?

648
01:05:48,347 --> 01:05:51,214
I hope your stay in America
hasn't changed your preferences

649
01:05:51,417 --> 01:05:52,679
Oh no

650
01:05:53,452 --> 01:05:55,750
That's okay. Ask KajaI.
She might remind you

651
01:05:56,088 --> 01:05:59,649
ShouId I?
- No, I remember now

652
01:06:00,192 --> 01:06:02,183
I want some tea.
Bring it to my room

653
01:06:02,695 --> 01:06:04,219
I'm giving sis-in-Iaw a hand

654
01:06:04,430 --> 01:06:08,594
Just go to your room,
I'II send it with Kaka, okay?

655
01:06:10,102 --> 01:06:12,900
I couIdn't find today's newspaper.
CouId you bring it for me?

656
01:06:13,105 --> 01:06:16,541
Brother's reading the newspaper.
Why don't you read it with him?

657
01:06:19,378 --> 01:06:21,642
I'm going to take a shower.
Get me a toweI

658
01:06:22,114 --> 01:06:26,380
Listen... the toweI's
aIready in the bathroom

659
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:29,451
Anything eIse?
- Nothing

660
01:06:30,122 --> 01:06:32,283
Listen...
- Now what?

661
01:06:33,125 --> 01:06:36,720
Dad has something important to discuss
with you. Have a word with him, wiII you?

662
01:06:37,129 --> 01:06:39,120
I'II bring your tea there. Okay?

663
01:06:45,571 --> 01:06:47,562
Come, son. Sit down

664
01:06:52,211 --> 01:06:58,150
Arav, why don't you work here in India,
instead of America?

665
01:06:59,151 --> 01:07:02,143
Daddy, I won't get that
kind of response in India...

666
01:07:02,421 --> 01:07:06,152
Why? Don't they make cars in India?
There are severaI big companies here, Arav

667
01:07:07,226 --> 01:07:12,163
Brother, the cars I have designed are
aII meant for the internationaI market

668
01:07:12,831 --> 01:07:14,822
Those cars are not meant
for Indian roads

669
01:07:15,234 --> 01:07:18,726
And now when I am getting
recognition in America...

670
01:07:19,104 --> 01:07:20,935
it's not wise to make a shift.
- Okay!

671
01:07:21,073 --> 01:07:22,597
But make sure you take
KajaI aIong this time

672
01:07:22,741 --> 01:07:24,834
That reminds me,
I have to book my ticket...

673
01:07:25,244 --> 01:07:31,513
and I can't find my passport anywhere.
- KajaI, have you seen his passport?

674
01:07:32,251 --> 01:07:34,242
No, he must've kept it somewhere

675
01:07:34,586 --> 01:07:37,180
I had kept it in my suitcase.
And now it's not there

676
01:07:37,656 --> 01:07:42,184
HeIp him find it. WiII you, dear?
- Sure, Dad

677
01:07:50,636 --> 01:07:55,198
You said it's not in the suitcase.
So what is this?

678
01:07:55,607 --> 01:08:00,203
I wanted some privacy with you.
- Oh!

679
01:08:02,214 --> 01:08:04,546
What? Why're you giving me
those Iooks?

680
01:08:05,217 --> 01:08:08,482
I see you're in a terribIy
romantic mood right now

681
01:08:09,688 --> 01:08:13,021
And as far as I remember, tiII Iast
night you wanted to divorce me

682
01:08:13,826 --> 01:08:16,226
And since this morning you have
been ordering me around Iike a husband

683
01:08:16,562 --> 01:08:21,022
Get me a cup of tea, get me the paper,
get me the toweI... come to my room

684
01:08:22,134 --> 01:08:27,231
So here I am!
TeII me... what can I do for you?

685
01:08:28,307 --> 01:08:31,765
HoId the tea-cup to your Iips?
Read out the paper to you?

686
01:08:33,512 --> 01:08:35,776
Or take you into the bathroom
and bathe you?

687
01:08:36,582 --> 01:08:38,914
Yeah, Iet's do that!
Take off your cIothes

688
01:08:40,285 --> 01:08:44,654
You are wasting my time
as weII as your own

689
01:08:45,591 --> 01:08:48,583
I asked you to sign those papers.
Why haven't you signed them yet?

690
01:08:49,294 --> 01:08:51,762
So time spent with me now
is time wasted?

691
01:08:54,132 --> 01:08:59,263
Then what about those past three years
that I have spent waiting for you?

692
01:09:02,274 --> 01:09:04,868
If you wanted a divorce, why didn't you
ask for it on the night of marriage?

693
01:09:05,611 --> 01:09:12,744
Why did you ruin my three years?
Can you return those three years to me?

694
01:09:14,353 --> 01:09:18,881
This is a pointIess argument, KajaI.
You'II have to sign those papers. Okay?

695
01:09:21,293 --> 01:09:23,625
It takes time to buiId
a reIationship...

696
01:09:24,796 --> 01:09:26,787
it aIso takes time to break it

697
01:09:28,467 --> 01:09:33,962
I won't sign those papers so easiIy,
I got to show these papers to my Iawyer

698
01:09:34,973 --> 01:09:37,464
What wiII you show your Iawyer?
What's he going to see?

699
01:09:37,876 --> 01:09:40,640
Who knows what you've
written in those papers?

700
01:09:41,213 --> 01:09:43,113
I'II have to consuIt a Iawyer, right?

701
01:09:44,650 --> 01:09:47,642
So now you trust your Iawyer
more than you trust me?

702
01:09:49,388 --> 01:09:51,652
You shouIdn't even
taIk about trust Arav

703
01:09:52,491 --> 01:09:59,488
My grandma and I trusted you.
EIse, why wouId I marry you?

704
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:05,393
By asking for a divorce,
you have broken everyone's trust

705
01:10:07,372 --> 01:10:10,864
Why shouId I trust you anymore?

706
01:10:12,678 --> 01:10:19,811
Okay, you may consuIt your Iawyer but
just teII me how much time it wiII take

707
01:10:20,352 --> 01:10:22,149
That I can't say!

708
01:10:22,521 --> 01:10:25,012
When you can't trust anyone
easiIy nowadays...

709
01:10:25,357 --> 01:10:27,689
I don't know when wiII I find
a Iawyer I can trust

710
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:33,959
TeII me something. I have heard that in
America when a man divorces his wife...

711
01:10:34,433 --> 01:10:37,027
he goes bankrupt.
Is it true?

712
01:10:37,569 --> 01:10:43,371
This is not America, this in India
and it doesn't happen in India

713
01:10:44,476 --> 01:10:51,882
True. It doesn't happen here because
a wife never divorces her husband

714
01:10:53,485 --> 01:10:56,921
But not to worry.
I'II think about it.

715
01:11:30,856 --> 01:11:32,847
Kaka! Fetch a bucket
of water. Quick!

716
01:11:33,091 --> 01:11:35,082
Go on...
- Where? No!

717
01:11:35,427 --> 01:11:37,622
Go inside, I say!

718
01:11:38,430 --> 01:11:40,421
Kaka, I'II give it to him

719
01:11:45,871 --> 01:11:48,601
Are you here, Kaka?
Hurry up and give me the water

720
01:11:55,480 --> 01:12:00,008
Kaka! Can't you see...?
Pour it on my hands! Hurry!

721
01:12:02,454 --> 01:12:06,948
Kaka! You've reaIIy gone bIind!
Pour it on my hands... my hands!

722
01:12:09,928 --> 01:12:11,793
What are you doing...?

723
01:12:13,665 --> 01:12:15,792
Give me the toweI.
Where's the toweI?

724
01:12:18,470 --> 01:12:19,459
You!

725
01:12:20,839 --> 01:12:22,067
What are you doing here?

726
01:12:22,808 --> 01:12:24,332
What noise is that in the bathroom?

727
01:12:24,476 --> 01:12:26,967
That's what happens when there are
two peopIe in the bathroom

728
01:12:27,479 --> 01:12:29,970
Two...? You mean, KajaI and Arav?

729
01:12:30,549 --> 01:12:32,278
Watch the fun!

730
01:12:35,921 --> 01:12:40,654
There's the water.
- You pIayed this prank, didn't you?

731
01:12:40,826 --> 01:12:42,157
No, no,

732
01:12:44,496 --> 01:12:47,829
It's hurting me...
but it's such a sweet pain

733
01:12:49,501 --> 01:12:51,298
The pain of Iove is aIways sweet

734
01:12:56,575 --> 01:12:59,510
Oh my God! What sound was that?
I think they've faIIen down.

735
01:12:59,811 --> 01:13:01,506
Happens. AII the time

736
01:13:18,697 --> 01:13:21,530
Aunty I'II aIso take a shower with you!
- Shut up!

737
01:13:25,604 --> 01:13:28,038
Learn! Learn something
from your brother!

738
01:13:28,540 --> 01:13:30,531
But in the bathroom...?

739
01:13:31,543 --> 01:13:34,979
In a tight hug, smooching away...
drenched in the water!

740
01:13:41,553 --> 01:13:43,987
Hi Anna!
- Hi Arav, how are you?

741
01:13:44,790 --> 01:13:45,779
I'm fine

742
01:13:45,924 --> 01:13:48,017
Don't pick up the phone, I was
trying your number and you caIIed

743
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:53,662
That's teIepathy for you. We both
miss each other at the same time

744
01:13:54,566 --> 01:13:58,024
We might be in far away Iands,
but our hearts are together

745
01:13:58,870 --> 01:14:02,567
Anyway, how's your dad?
- He's much better now

746
01:14:03,642 --> 01:14:07,169
So come back immediateIy.
I don't Iike it here without you

747
01:14:08,013 --> 01:14:12,245
Same here, but a property
Iitigation has cropped up...

748
01:14:12,684 --> 01:14:16,586
and I can't ignore that.
I want to get those papers signed...

749
01:14:17,155 --> 01:14:20,591
and return to you with
aII my issues resoIved

750
01:14:20,926 --> 01:14:22,917
Okay, baby, I Iove you

751
01:14:23,495 --> 01:14:25,588
I Iove you too

752
01:14:34,105 --> 01:14:35,766
How are you?

753
01:14:36,942 --> 01:14:39,274
You didn't even inform us that
you were coming to India!

754
01:14:39,611 --> 01:14:41,602
It wasn't pIanned,
it happened aII of a sudden

755
01:14:41,780 --> 01:14:43,680
Were you missing your wife?

756
01:14:43,982 --> 01:14:46,041
Forget about me.
TeII me what's up with you guys?

757
01:14:46,284 --> 01:14:50,653
Nothing much! Days of romance are past.
We're now sIaves to our wives

758
01:14:51,223 --> 01:14:53,885
Forget that. Let's do something.
- What?

759
01:14:54,293 --> 01:14:58,696
Let's pIay a game.
- Sure, but what game?

760
01:14:59,331 --> 01:15:01,322
Word power.
- Word power?

761
01:15:01,700 --> 01:15:03,691
What's that?
- I'II teII you

762
01:15:03,902 --> 01:15:08,635
There's aIways a word to expIain
anything in every Ianguage

763
01:15:09,241 --> 01:15:12,301
Like ''khushi'' is the Hindi word
used for happiness

764
01:15:12,644 --> 01:15:15,909
Correct. That's right.
- So I'II give a word in EngIish...

765
01:15:16,815 --> 01:15:21,309
and you must transIate it into Hindi.
- No probIem! SimpIe transIation!

766
01:15:21,954 --> 01:15:25,355
That's okay, but what wiII
the winner get?

767
01:15:25,657 --> 01:15:27,921
Yeah, what's the prize?
- Whatever the winner asks for

768
01:15:28,260 --> 01:15:31,923
Sounds great! So who's the first?
- Me

769
01:15:32,998 --> 01:15:36,263
TeII me what you caII
a button in Hindi?

770
01:15:36,602 --> 01:15:41,369
A button? I'II teII you! It's caIIed
''Ast vyast vastra niyantra gotika''

771
01:15:43,041 --> 01:15:44,804
When your cIothes faII off...

772
01:15:45,010 --> 01:15:49,379
then the baII used to bring
them together is caIIed a button

773
01:15:49,815 --> 01:15:51,749
Great! Mind-bIowing!

774
01:15:52,184 --> 01:15:54,618
MereIy saying mind-bIowing
is not enough

775
01:15:55,053 --> 01:15:57,613
How about my prize?
- Anything you want!

776
01:15:57,823 --> 01:16:01,350
God bIess my souI!
Give me a Punjabi kiss then!

777
01:16:03,962 --> 01:16:05,554
C'mon... Iet's do it!

778
01:16:07,232 --> 01:16:11,134
Enough, stop it!
It's my turn now

779
01:16:11,470 --> 01:16:15,702
One moment. If I answer your
question, what wiII you give me?

780
01:16:16,642 --> 01:16:18,542
Whatever you ask for.
- Yes!

781
01:16:18,744 --> 01:16:23,977
It's a promise in everybody's presence.
- Sure, aII right. But what if you Iose?

782
01:16:24,149 --> 01:16:28,552
Ask me the question first.
- What do you caII divorce in Hindi?

783
01:16:29,655 --> 01:16:33,557
Very simpIe... ''taIaak''.
- Yes! Bravo, Arav! You've won!

784
01:16:33,992 --> 01:16:39,396
No Arav, you have Iost. Because taIaak
is an Urdu word, not Hindi

785
01:16:42,701 --> 01:16:46,569
And however hard you try,
you won't find the answer...

786
01:16:47,439 --> 01:16:50,533
because in our cuIture, there's
no such thing as a divorce

787
01:16:51,009 --> 01:16:54,001
So how can there be any such word?
You've Iost, Arav

788
01:17:00,018 --> 01:17:06,014
Now that KajaI has won, here's her
opportunity to ask Arav for something

789
01:17:06,792 --> 01:17:09,352
What?
- Ask for whatever you wish

790
01:17:10,028 --> 01:17:12,019
Ask for something. Go on!

791
01:17:12,364 --> 01:17:15,356
Okay, I'II heIp you out.
Ask Arav for a kiss!

792
01:17:18,470 --> 01:17:20,768
He'd accept that punishment
with pIeasure!

793
01:17:26,044 --> 01:17:31,846
''He does not understand
what my eyes convey...''

794
01:17:32,451 --> 01:17:37,388
''my beIoved is so wicked''

795
01:17:37,789 --> 01:17:40,451
''Goodness me...''

796
01:17:41,059 --> 01:17:49,057
''every man and woman knows
what I'm taIking about''

797
01:18:10,088 --> 01:18:14,252
''SecretIy, siIentIy...''

798
01:18:20,566 --> 01:18:23,091
''secretIy, he Iooked
into her eyes''

799
01:18:30,208 --> 01:18:33,109
''I stoIe a Iook into his eyes...''

800
01:18:38,116 --> 01:18:43,110
''I steaIthiIy Iooked
into my sweetheart's eyes''

801
01:18:53,465 --> 01:18:57,925
''How my friends burn in envy''

802
01:19:08,413 --> 01:19:13,476
''When and how did you steaI a Iook
into your beIoved's eyes?''

803
01:19:18,156 --> 01:19:23,321
''I refuse to beIieve what you say''

804
01:19:23,762 --> 01:19:26,322
''I stoIe a Iook into his eyes...''

805
01:19:45,183 --> 01:19:53,181
''O Moon, your moonIight
stokes fires of passion''

806
01:19:54,192 --> 01:19:58,185
''My wicked sweetheart
does not understand...''

807
01:19:58,630 --> 01:20:03,192
''his eyes continue to rove''

808
01:20:04,202 --> 01:20:08,536
''SecretIy, steaIthiIy...''

809
01:20:26,258 --> 01:20:30,718
''My ankIets chime,
my dot shines...''

810
01:20:31,263 --> 01:20:35,461
''I can't go to sIeep,
oh what do I do''

811
01:20:36,535 --> 01:20:40,904
''A fire rages in my heart,
my heart is pounding...''

812
01:20:41,306 --> 01:20:45,572
''my scarf is sIipping away...
oh what do I do?''

813
01:20:47,245 --> 01:20:51,705
''Against my ornate bangIes,
my bangIes tinkIe...''

814
01:20:52,250 --> 01:20:57,244
''it's driving me out of my senses,
oh how it aII torments me''

815
01:21:07,766 --> 01:21:15,263
''I can't spend my nights
without you anymore''

816
01:21:18,076 --> 01:21:25,505
''SecretIy, I met my
beIoved's gaze''

817
01:21:37,395 --> 01:21:39,955
''ReIent now, buddy-boy,
she's your wife after aII''

818
01:21:40,298 --> 01:21:42,892
''Go for her quietIy,
she's your honey''

819
01:21:43,235 --> 01:21:45,100
''Be a man,
make her day sunny''

820
01:21:45,303 --> 01:21:48,295
''Give a kiss
and don't be funny''

821
01:22:02,654 --> 01:22:07,318
''The cIouds reach for my hand...''

822
01:22:07,592 --> 01:22:12,188
''they caII me their beIoved,
it scares me reaIIy''

823
01:22:12,664 --> 01:22:17,328
''They hover around me,
quietIy and secretIy...''

824
01:22:17,736 --> 01:22:22,469
''they tug at my hand...
it scares me so''

825
01:22:23,408 --> 01:22:28,004
''I'm a wanderer,
to move on is my Iot''

826
01:22:28,446 --> 01:22:33,349
''Like the burning embers,
I'm a wayward Iover''

827
01:22:44,296 --> 01:22:51,896
''Why do you try to
shackIe your beIoved?''

828
01:22:54,372 --> 01:23:02,370
''When and how did you
meet your sweetheart's gaze?''

829
01:23:04,616 --> 01:23:08,950
''I refuse to beIieve
what you say''

830
01:23:09,487 --> 01:23:16,552
''SecretIy, I met my
beIoved's gaze''

831
01:23:17,028 --> 01:23:21,055
''SecretIy, siIentIy...''

832
01:23:26,805 --> 01:23:31,401
''with the beIoved...''

833
01:23:32,410 --> 01:23:40,408
''my beIoved's gaze...''

834
01:23:42,787 --> 01:23:45,415
''I met secretIy''

835
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:12,441
KajaI... where did you
go and get drenched?

836
01:24:15,453 --> 01:24:17,717
She went away without
saying anything!

837
01:24:18,924 --> 01:24:22,917
This is amazing! KajaI was
drenched and so you are

838
01:24:23,461 --> 01:24:25,452
Where did you go and get drenched?

839
01:24:28,466 --> 01:24:30,991
Funny! This guys waIks away
without a word too

840
01:24:31,870 --> 01:24:34,464
What's up with them?
They get soaked in the bathroom...

841
01:24:34,806 --> 01:24:39,470
and go out to get drenched.
- It's time you Iearnt from your brother

842
01:24:39,978 --> 01:24:42,139
Why? Does something great happen
if you get wet?

843
01:24:42,514 --> 01:24:44,482
As if I need to expIain that!

844
01:24:46,484 --> 01:24:51,478
There! She hasn't said anything too.
Looks Iike I need to do something

845
01:24:56,828 --> 01:25:00,491
You want to taIk about something, bro?
- Nothing much...

846
01:25:01,166 --> 01:25:03,157
Finish what you're doing.
I'II catch up with you Iater

847
01:25:03,501 --> 01:25:06,959
What did you want to ask, brother?
- Nothing important...

848
01:25:07,305 --> 01:25:09,500
just for the heck of it.
- Okay

849
01:25:10,542 --> 01:25:13,170
Okay...? No, no!
It's not okay

850
01:25:14,579 --> 01:25:19,039
I do have something to ask you.
- So go ahead.

851
01:25:19,851 --> 01:25:25,312
WeII, what is that
getting wet aII about?

852
01:25:27,525 --> 01:25:31,120
What? Why have you stopped?
Ask the question

853
01:25:31,629 --> 01:25:36,191
Later.
- Why Iater? Ask him right now

854
01:25:36,868 --> 01:25:38,927
I might as weII be
enIightened too

855
01:25:39,471 --> 01:25:40,870
What?
- Oh yes

856
01:25:42,007 --> 01:25:45,534
It had something to do with getting
drenched, isn't it bro? So ask me

857
01:25:46,544 --> 01:25:49,980
Getting drenched...?
- That's right... getting drenched

858
01:25:50,882 --> 01:25:54,545
It's Iike this, dad. The car Arav
has designed does not have a roof...

859
01:25:55,053 --> 01:25:58,545
so won't peopIe get
soaked in the rains?

860
01:25:58,990 --> 01:26:02,687
Right. In the rains,
that car's going to be fIooded

861
01:26:03,094 --> 01:26:08,726
Dad, this is a romantic car.
A two- seater. OnIy for coupIes

862
01:26:09,968 --> 01:26:12,698
Apart from the joy of driving,
you can even enjoy getting drenched

863
01:26:12,937 --> 01:26:16,566
But what do you do after getting
drenched? I mean, don't you feeI coId?

864
01:26:17,609 --> 01:26:22,569
My son, when you have a girI with you,
you don't feeI the chiII

865
01:26:33,058 --> 01:26:36,118
KajaI, I'm sure this monsoon
is going to do something

866
01:26:37,095 --> 01:26:40,087
I can see its effect on Arav.
- No sister-in- Iaw

867
01:26:41,266 --> 01:26:45,600
This monsoon's having an effect
on everyone, accept Arav

868
01:26:48,106 --> 01:26:50,404
It was this very rain that
once brought us together...

869
01:26:51,409 --> 01:26:54,606
but I'm afraid, it might
separate us this time

870
01:26:57,615 --> 01:27:03,019
But I won't give up so easiIy.
As they say, pray sincereIy...

871
01:27:03,421 --> 01:27:05,412
and you wiII even find God

872
01:27:06,558 --> 01:27:09,686
And then, Arav is not just my Iove,
he's aIso my husband

873
01:27:11,029 --> 01:27:14,226
I can see onIy one way of getting
a divorce from her

874
01:27:14,632 --> 01:27:20,298
What's that?
- I'II produce a few witnesses in court

875
01:27:20,638 --> 01:27:25,974
What for?
- You've been in America for 3 years

876
01:27:26,644 --> 01:27:30,637
During this period, this girI has had
an iIIegitimate affair with two men

877
01:27:30,849 --> 01:27:32,043
Mr Lawyer!

878
01:27:35,687 --> 01:27:38,656
Now Iook, I don't wish to
make her Iife a butt ofjokes

879
01:27:41,326 --> 01:27:47,322
In that case, you'II have to
appIy for divorce by mutuaI consent

880
01:27:54,005 --> 01:27:56,667
Yes, I remember.
I'II be back home soon

881
01:27:57,675 --> 01:27:59,074
Okay? Bye

882
01:28:01,112 --> 01:28:05,014
That was my wife. She's fasting
for my Iong Iife today

883
01:28:06,684 --> 01:28:09,346
Very weII then. Have
those papers signed...

884
01:28:09,854 --> 01:28:12,186
and I'II handIe the rest
of the formaIities

885
01:28:25,770 --> 01:28:30,036
Aunty, are you not thirsty?
- No

886
01:28:30,708 --> 01:28:33,108
Aren't you hungry either?
- Not at aII

887
01:28:33,711 --> 01:28:35,702
But I can't remain hungry for Iong

888
01:28:36,781 --> 01:28:40,717
KajaI, Arav has gone to DeIhi.
He'II be Iate

889
01:28:41,719 --> 01:28:45,849
You haven't had anything since this
morning. So go and eat something

890
01:28:46,124 --> 01:28:48,319
No, Mom.
I'II wait for him

891
01:28:50,161 --> 01:28:51,992
AII these years when Arav
wasn't here...

892
01:28:52,130 --> 01:28:55,224
you ended your fast by Iooking
at his photograph, didn't you?

893
01:28:55,767 --> 01:29:00,727
That was different, sister-in-Iaw.
Today he is here with me...

894
01:29:01,072 --> 01:29:04,235
he shouId be coming any moment,
I'II wait for him

895
01:29:05,076 --> 01:29:07,408
The young master's back!
The young master has arrived

896
01:29:12,183 --> 01:29:15,482
Where were you aII this whiIe?
KajaI's been waiting for you

897
01:29:16,221 --> 01:29:19,748
You're just not bothered about her.
- What was so important...

898
01:29:20,258 --> 01:29:22,556
that you had to go away to DeIhi
on the day she fasts for you?

899
01:29:22,894 --> 01:29:25,362
You couId easiIy have gone tomorrow.
It's so irresponsibIe of you

900
01:29:25,830 --> 01:29:27,764
Go to your wife immediateIy

901
01:29:30,835 --> 01:29:34,771
What the heII, KajaI! You very weII
know that I want to divorce you...

902
01:29:35,173 --> 01:29:38,301
so what's this farce for?
- This is no farce, Arav

903
01:29:38,843 --> 01:29:42,108
It's our custom.
- I don't beIieve in such customs!

904
01:29:42,847 --> 01:29:45,111
There are so many things
you don't beIieve in, Arav

905
01:29:45,783 --> 01:29:51,119
But I do and so I observed
this fast for your happiness

906
01:29:51,422 --> 01:29:54,789
If you reaIIy want to see me happy,
then sign these papers

907
01:29:56,728 --> 01:29:59,788
What's wrong with me Arav?
Why don't you Iove me?

908
01:30:00,231 --> 01:30:02,131
Why do you want me to
sign these divorce papers?

909
01:30:02,300 --> 01:30:04,291
Because I don't Iove you!

910
01:30:04,802 --> 01:30:09,239
I'm in Iove with Anna and Anna
is waiting for me in America

911
01:30:10,141 --> 01:30:13,338
TiII you don't give me a divorce,
I can't marry Anna...

912
01:30:14,112 --> 01:30:16,342
so pIease set me free
from this reIationship

913
01:30:19,817 --> 01:30:21,808
Sign these papers!

914
01:30:39,404 --> 01:30:45,240
''I have Ioved you so much...''

915
01:30:46,311 --> 01:30:51,840
''but you do not Iove me anymore''

916
01:30:53,184 --> 01:30:58,850
''I've had so much
of faith in you...''

917
01:30:59,857 --> 01:31:06,194
''but no Ionger
do I trust you''

918
01:31:07,865 --> 01:31:11,665
Divorce! That's a word not seven
generations of our Iineage has even used!

919
01:31:12,170 --> 01:31:15,162
And you want to divorce KajaI
because you Iove another girI!

920
01:31:15,473 --> 01:31:16,872
You're out of your mind!

921
01:31:17,041 --> 01:31:19,032
I didn't want to marry her
in the first pIace

922
01:31:19,277 --> 01:31:21,268
You were the ones
who forced me into it

923
01:31:22,914 --> 01:31:25,678
My son, if you end
this reIationship...

924
01:31:26,150 --> 01:31:28,050
our whoIe famiIy wiII go to seed!

925
01:31:28,353 --> 01:31:33,290
Mom, KajaI is just a friend to me.
I'm not in Iove with her!

926
01:31:33,791 --> 01:31:36,282
Today you don't Iove KajaI,
tomorrow you won't Iove us!

927
01:31:36,694 --> 01:31:38,685
You wiII Ieave aII of us.
- Dad...

928
01:31:42,767 --> 01:31:50,401
pIease don't get worked up.
It's a mutuaI decision

929
01:31:50,775 --> 01:31:54,404
But what for?
- Because this reIation...

930
01:31:54,912 --> 01:31:58,507
has reached a point from where
it's going nowhere

931
01:32:01,919 --> 01:32:09,451
Even if you wish to see me happy,
how can I be ever happy with a man...

932
01:32:11,729 --> 01:32:13,720
who doesn't even Iove me?

933
01:32:16,968 --> 01:32:19,596
''You are unfaithfuI...''

934
01:32:20,371 --> 01:32:22,931
''I have Iearnt''

935
01:32:23,875 --> 01:32:26,537
''Where do you go away...''

936
01:32:27,044 --> 01:32:29,535
''your gaze Iowered?''

937
01:32:30,615 --> 01:32:33,550
''May you be bIessed...''

938
01:32:33,951 --> 01:32:36,943
''with the joys you seek''

939
01:32:37,755 --> 01:32:40,553
''LoneIiness...''

940
01:32:40,958 --> 01:32:43,358
''is aII I have''

941
01:32:44,429 --> 01:32:50,299
''Wait for you,
I aIways did''

942
01:32:51,235 --> 01:32:54,295
''Wait for you...''

943
01:32:54,972 --> 01:32:56,963
''I never wiII again''

944
01:32:58,042 --> 01:33:03,412
''I have Ioved you so much...''

945
01:33:04,482 --> 01:33:10,648
''I Iove you no more''

946
01:33:12,990 --> 01:33:17,518
Parents must never force
their decisions on their chiIdren

947
01:33:19,464 --> 01:33:22,991
One mistake of ours is responsibIe
for this situation

948
01:33:41,352 --> 01:33:49,350
PIease forgive us, my chiId.
Our mistake has ruined your Iife

949
01:33:49,727 --> 01:33:54,130
No dad, you did it
onIy for my weII- being

950
01:33:56,267 --> 01:33:58,428
Maybe it wasn't in my destiny

951
01:34:07,378 --> 01:34:08,640
My chiId!

952
01:34:21,058 --> 01:34:22,389
Good bye

953
01:34:52,757 --> 01:34:54,884
Aunty, are you Ieaving?

954
01:34:57,094 --> 01:35:01,360
You wiII come back, won't you?
At Ieast to meet me?

955
01:35:15,913 --> 01:35:19,110
''How I impIored you...''

956
01:35:19,450 --> 01:35:22,442
''to be IoyaI to me''

957
01:35:22,920 --> 01:35:25,787
''You are my own...''

958
01:35:26,223 --> 01:35:28,714
''do not ever betray me,
do not ever cheat on me''

959
01:35:37,201 --> 01:35:43,140
''For you, I couId
Iay down my Iife''

960
01:35:44,141 --> 01:35:49,602
''Lay down my Iife for you...
I never wiII anymore''

961
01:35:50,848 --> 01:35:56,582
''I trusted you impIicitIy...''

962
01:35:57,655 --> 01:36:03,491
''Trust you, I do not anymore''

963
01:36:40,265 --> 01:36:42,062
Isn't the Iawyer there?

964
01:36:42,234 --> 01:36:44,566
He's away for an important case
in AIIahabad

965
01:36:45,303 --> 01:36:46,565
Okay, the documents are signed

966
01:36:46,705 --> 01:36:48,570
Ask him to compIete the formaIities
as soon as possibIe

967
01:36:48,673 --> 01:36:50,106
Very weII, sir

968
01:36:51,076 --> 01:36:52,839
Hi babe, how've you been?

969
01:36:53,044 --> 01:36:55,137
Hi sweetheart!
I'm missing you so much

970
01:36:55,580 --> 01:36:57,047
I miss you too, baby

971
01:36:57,215 --> 01:37:00,378
When are you coming back?
It's been so Iong

972
01:37:00,786 --> 01:37:03,254
Is your work not over yet?
Did you get the papers signed?

973
01:37:03,455 --> 01:37:05,753
Yes, I've got them signed,
now there's no probIem

974
01:37:06,158 --> 01:37:08,149
I'II be right there after DiwaIi

975
01:37:08,493 --> 01:37:10,586
Now from where did this
DiwaIi spring between us?

976
01:37:11,296 --> 01:37:15,596
This is my Iast DiwaIi in India and then
I'II ceIebrate aII my DiwaIis with you

977
01:37:16,001 --> 01:37:19,937
AII right, but you're coming here
straight to me. Okay?

978
01:37:20,338 --> 01:37:22,033
Okay, I promise

979
01:37:23,475 --> 01:37:24,703
I Iove you

980
01:37:24,843 --> 01:37:27,937
I Iove you too, babes.
You take care. Bye

981
01:37:37,956 --> 01:37:42,154
Mom, dad, Iet's Iight some Iamps
and perform a prayer to the Goddess

982
01:37:43,094 --> 01:37:46,757
A Iamp won't bring any Iight with
our hearts so pIunged in darkness

983
01:37:47,732 --> 01:37:49,632
This was the Iast thing I expected

984
01:37:50,869 --> 01:37:55,238
I thought this DiwaIi, aII famiIy
members wouId perform the prayers

985
01:37:56,641 --> 01:38:00,702
But now I feeI as if the Goddess
of WeaIth is annoyed with us

986
01:38:00,979 --> 01:38:04,710
No daddy. The Goddess
can never be annoyed with us

987
01:38:04,983 --> 01:38:06,644
KajaI!
- Sister- in-Iaw

988
01:38:09,087 --> 01:38:11,851
How are you?
- I'm fine, how have you been?

989
01:38:12,657 --> 01:38:14,318
May you be happy, my chiId!

990
01:38:14,659 --> 01:38:16,320
KajaI?
- Brother

991
01:38:16,661 --> 01:38:18,322
How are you?
- Chintu!

992
01:38:24,069 --> 01:38:26,663
Aunt has arrived!
Aunt is here!

993
01:38:35,146 --> 01:38:37,671
It's DiwaIi night, so there
shouId be no darkness in the house

994
01:38:38,683 --> 01:38:40,480
Come, sister-in-Iaw.
Let's Iight some Iamps

995
01:38:58,703 --> 01:39:02,298
KajaI, you must have
Ieft this house...

996
01:39:03,141 --> 01:39:05,132
but not our hearts, my chiId

997
01:39:06,711 --> 01:39:08,201
Very true, my chiId

998
01:39:08,613 --> 01:39:11,377
You are no Ionger our daughter-in-Iaw.
You are now our daughter

999
01:39:38,743 --> 01:39:44,306
After ages I've seen smiIing faces.
Thank you very much. Happy DiwaIi

1000
01:39:57,329 --> 01:40:03,757
I've forwarded the case, but these
formaIities take time, KajaI

1001
01:40:04,936 --> 01:40:08,428
It's very important for me to get
this Ioan sanctioned as soon as possibIe

1002
01:40:09,140 --> 01:40:11,768
I can't promise you anything,
but I wiII definiteIy do my best

1003
01:40:12,110 --> 01:40:13,441
Thank you, sir

1004
01:40:17,115 --> 01:40:18,980
C'mon, KajaI. I'II drop you home

1005
01:40:19,250 --> 01:40:23,311
No, I'II wait for the bus.
- PIease KajaI, come on

1006
01:40:41,206 --> 01:40:43,538
KajaI, can I ask you
for something as a friend?

1007
01:40:45,343 --> 01:40:47,334
What eIse do you want now?

1008
01:40:49,247 --> 01:40:51,238
Your anger is justified

1009
01:40:51,916 --> 01:40:55,818
But under the circumstances,
I know I have hurt you

1010
01:40:58,289 --> 01:41:04,819
That wasn't a good thing I did.
PIease forgive me, if you can

1011
01:41:07,499 --> 01:41:13,335
When you Iook from a distance, the
two ends of a road appears to be one

1012
01:41:15,006 --> 01:41:18,999
But when the journey gets over,
you reaIize that they never ever met

1013
01:41:20,445 --> 01:41:23,243
Had we even Iived together,
we wouId have never been happy

1014
01:41:26,418 --> 01:41:30,548
Can't you find a nice man
and settIe down with him?

1015
01:41:32,991 --> 01:41:35,516
The end of a reIationship
is not end of the worId

1016
01:41:41,299 --> 01:41:45,531
But how about a girI for whom the whoIe
worId revoIved around one reIationship?

1017
01:41:48,540 --> 01:41:50,531
PIease stop the car.
I want to get down

1018
01:41:51,276 --> 01:41:54,268
No, I'II drop you home.
I need to taIk to grandma as weII

1019
01:41:55,880 --> 01:41:59,873
I haven't met her in a Iong time.
I don't know how I'II face her

1020
01:42:10,895 --> 01:42:13,329
Everything's just as it was earIier.
Nothing has changed...

1021
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:23,705
When did this happen?

1022
01:42:25,910 --> 01:42:27,901
Six months after you Ieft

1023
01:42:28,913 --> 01:42:31,643
Grandma passed away and
no one bothered to inform me?

1024
01:42:33,351 --> 01:42:35,342
Grandma toId us not to

1025
01:42:36,488 --> 01:42:39,924
She knew that if you got to know,
you wouId come back...

1026
01:42:41,926 --> 01:42:44,588
and she didn't want to be
an obstacIe in your success

1027
01:42:47,332 --> 01:42:54,534
And I... I was so obsessed with
achieving heights of success...

1028
01:42:56,274 --> 01:42:59,266
that I forgot my roots,
my identity

1029
01:43:04,949 --> 01:43:07,941
Grandma so badIy wanted
to see my success

1030
01:43:08,753 --> 01:43:13,213
And now when the time has come,
she is no Ionger with us to see it

1031
01:43:15,460 --> 01:43:23,458
You have shared your grief with me,
but have you ever wondered...

1032
01:43:26,471 --> 01:43:28,462
what I went through?

1033
01:43:30,975 --> 01:43:39,474
I had no shouIder to cry on,
I was aII aIone

1034
01:43:54,999 --> 01:43:58,526
Arav, got some work with me?

1035
01:43:59,671 --> 01:44:05,610
Yes, actuaIIy I wanted you to
give cheque of $10,000 to KajaI

1036
01:44:06,177 --> 01:44:10,011
She needs it.
- Why shouId I give it to her?

1037
01:44:11,115 --> 01:44:13,447
You want to give it to her,
so do it yourseIf

1038
01:44:26,097 --> 01:44:31,034
$10,000 is 450,000 rupees.

1039
01:44:33,037 --> 01:44:35,631
Be honest.
Is it your first earning?

1040
01:44:36,040 --> 01:44:38,372
No, KajaI, it's...
- I don't want it

1041
01:44:40,111 --> 01:44:44,571
KajaI, pIease accept it.
For the sake of our friendship

1042
01:44:45,416 --> 01:44:49,409
You'II need it. I'II send you more,
shouId you need it in the future

1043
01:44:50,054 --> 01:44:54,650
PIease keep this now.
- Okay, I'II keep it

1044
01:44:55,593 --> 01:44:59,051
But I wish to show you something
before I accept it. Come with me

1045
01:45:13,177 --> 01:45:18,774
Which of these must I dispatch?
- Drop this one. Send the other one

1046
01:45:19,484 --> 01:45:21,281
CaII for you, madam.
- Excuse me

1047
01:45:22,754 --> 01:45:24,654
Hi, Mr. WaIker. How are you?

1048
01:45:25,089 --> 01:45:27,080
Yes, your consignment
is aIready on its way

1049
01:45:27,692 --> 01:45:29,683
It shouId reach you
the day after tomorrow.

1050
01:45:30,028 --> 01:45:33,088
The new orders? I'II check
my e- maiI and get back to you

1051
01:45:33,898 --> 01:45:35,763
Thank you, sir. Okay

1052
01:45:36,301 --> 01:45:38,496
When did you Iearn to
speak such fIuent EngIish?

1053
01:45:39,137 --> 01:45:44,097
After you Ieft, I had
to Iearn to keep up with you

1054
01:45:46,110 --> 01:45:47,634
Do you work here?

1055
01:45:48,046 --> 01:45:52,540
No, this is my partnership firm.
A & K Exports

1056
01:45:53,151 --> 01:45:57,713
You have a partner?
- Yes, a sIeeping partner...

1057
01:45:58,489 --> 01:46:01,686
but despite repeated attempts,
he just doesn't sIeep with me

1058
01:46:05,129 --> 01:46:06,926
Kaju, when did this aII happen?

1059
01:46:07,231 --> 01:46:09,631
You've caIIed me by that name
after so many years

1060
01:46:10,034 --> 01:46:11,661
Sorry, it just sIipped out

1061
01:46:12,036 --> 01:46:14,129
After you Ieft,
I had nothing to do

1062
01:46:14,439 --> 01:46:18,136
So I got together a few girIs and
women and started this factory

1063
01:46:20,178 --> 01:46:23,477
Business fIourished and
I appIied for a bank Ioan

1064
01:46:24,215 --> 01:46:27,480
But grandma objected and
she gave me 500,000 rupees

1065
01:46:28,052 --> 01:46:29,952
Where did grandma get
so much of money from?

1066
01:46:30,154 --> 01:46:32,679
She had some fixed deposits
in the post office

1067
01:46:33,224 --> 01:46:35,692
Fifty thousand rupees
in ourjoint account

1068
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:39,323
And thus, it was A K Exports.
Arav and KajaI

1069
01:46:43,434 --> 01:46:46,665
Our Iast three years have generated
a profit of 570,000

1070
01:46:47,171 --> 01:46:51,164
Your share therefore works out
to 285,000 rupees

1071
01:46:51,609 --> 01:46:53,440
You want it in rupees or doIIars?

1072
01:46:53,611 --> 01:46:55,772
Then why did you go to the bank
for a Ioan?

1073
01:46:57,181 --> 01:47:00,776
I have got a big order from Europe.
To execute it, I need 25 miIIion

1074
01:47:01,052 --> 01:47:03,612
CouId you come here, pIease?
- Sure. Excuse me

1075
01:47:18,603 --> 01:47:21,367
How we've Iost track of time.
WiII you have something to eat?

1076
01:47:21,773 --> 01:47:25,732
There used to be an eatery around,
remember? Famous for its parathas?

1077
01:47:26,544 --> 01:47:27,806
Yes, it's stiII there.

1078
01:47:28,045 --> 01:47:31,537
Remember how we used to run away
from our homes and come here to pIay?

1079
01:47:32,316 --> 01:47:34,477
And I used to take you
for a ride on my bicycIe

1080
01:47:34,685 --> 01:47:37,882
And try to scare me as weII.
- But you never got scared

1081
01:47:38,289 --> 01:47:40,223
That's because you were with me

1082
01:47:42,560 --> 01:47:45,222
KajaI, isn't this the pIace where
we had faIIen from our bicycIe?

1083
01:47:46,230 --> 01:47:48,221
You do remember everything

1084
01:47:49,233 --> 01:47:51,224
I can never forget
those moments KajaI

1085
01:47:52,570 --> 01:47:57,769
Whenever it rains, I can
see us cycIing on these tracks

1086
01:47:59,577 --> 01:48:04,571
You onIy remember the ride.
- No, what happened after that too

1087
01:48:06,250 --> 01:48:08,241
When Iightening struck

1088
01:48:42,086 --> 01:48:44,884
We pIanted trees somewhere here, right?
- Yes

1089
01:48:46,023 --> 01:48:47,615
They must've withered away by now

1090
01:48:47,758 --> 01:48:49,885
Anything that's pIanted
in the rains never dies

1091
01:48:50,328 --> 01:48:52,296
There's your tree

1092
01:48:59,303 --> 01:49:01,771
I toId you Arav,
I wouId never Iet them wither away

1093
01:49:02,106 --> 01:49:06,304
So this is my tree? And that one's yours?
- Yes, mine

1094
01:49:07,545 --> 01:49:09,911
They have grown, haven't they?
- Yes

1095
01:49:10,314 --> 01:49:11,645
Come here

1096
01:49:15,753 --> 01:49:18,313
Don't they Iook beautifuI?
- Sure

1097
01:49:18,723 --> 01:49:20,588
Let's knock off some mangoes

1098
01:49:26,330 --> 01:49:28,127
Pass me a stone, wiII you?

1099
01:49:42,346 --> 01:49:44,337
You stiII have a good aim

1100
01:49:44,749 --> 01:49:47,013
KajaI, it's stiII
the magic of your kiss

1101
01:50:09,607 --> 01:50:11,939
Take off your sweater, you'II catch coId.

1102
01:50:18,382 --> 01:50:24,378
''Rainy days usher in...''

1103
01:50:24,855 --> 01:50:30,384
''days of reunion''

1104
01:50:39,070 --> 01:50:43,200
''The pitter-patter of raindrops
ignites fires of passion''

1105
01:50:43,674 --> 01:50:47,838
''How we have begun to faIter in
our stride, we're indeed in a daze''

1106
01:50:48,245 --> 01:50:52,944
''These days of rains...''

1107
01:50:53,417 --> 01:50:57,012
''bring with them
times of a reunion''

1108
01:50:57,989 --> 01:51:05,987
''The night I so Iooked forward to
is here at Iast''

1109
01:51:22,313 --> 01:51:26,443
''I burnt in the fIames of fantasy.
For years, I endured separation''

1110
01:51:26,984 --> 01:51:31,045
''But this magnificent cIoudburst
has rekindIed my passions''

1111
01:51:31,789 --> 01:51:35,953
''These days of rains...''

1112
01:51:36,460 --> 01:51:40,453
''bring with them
times of reunion''

1113
01:51:41,132 --> 01:51:45,466
''The night I

1114
01:51:45,903 --> 01:51:50,465
''is here at Iast''

1115
01:52:29,080 --> 01:52:33,847
''Neither are you in your senses,
nor am I in my senses''

1116
01:52:34,318 --> 01:52:38,652
''I might yet stray...
steady me, pIease''

1117
01:52:38,956 --> 01:52:43,325
''Those are just my desires,
that's just my pIea...''

1118
01:52:43,761 --> 01:52:48,198
''gather me in your arms tonight,
my Iove''

1119
01:52:50,601 --> 01:52:55,129
''Here are the days we
have feIt for...''

1120
01:52:55,539 --> 01:52:59,976
''here are the days
when we meet again''

1121
01:53:00,544 --> 01:53:04,878
''The night I so badIy
Iooked forward to...''

1122
01:53:05,349 --> 01:53:09,342
''is here at Iast''

1123
01:53:28,973 --> 01:53:33,137
''YouthfuIness... it's crazy''

1124
01:53:33,644 --> 01:53:37,580
''A storm rages in their breath''

1125
01:53:38,582 --> 01:53:42,575
''Crazy... crazy moments''

1126
01:53:43,120 --> 01:53:47,580
''How desires seek to deceive''

1127
01:53:53,397 --> 01:53:57,595
''From my body biIIows a smoke...''

1128
01:53:57,968 --> 01:54:02,598
''Iet the cIouds continue to pour''

1129
01:54:03,007 --> 01:54:07,171
''Pangs of separation,
I can take no Ionger...''

1130
01:54:07,611 --> 01:54:12,014
''how Iong am I to pine Iike this?''

1131
01:54:12,349 --> 01:54:17,013
''Days of Iove are here...''

1132
01:54:17,421 --> 01:54:21,619
''days of reunion are here''

1133
01:54:22,059 --> 01:54:26,291
''The night I so badIy
Iooked forward to...''

1134
01:54:26,697 --> 01:54:31,066
''is here at Iast''

1135
01:55:10,741 --> 01:55:13,232
Arav, I am so very happy today!

1136
01:55:13,577 --> 01:55:15,477
Grandpa has decided that
we are coming to India...

1137
01:55:15,679 --> 01:55:18,170
and that's where our
wedding wiII take pIace

1138
01:55:18,682 --> 01:55:19,944
Wedding?

1139
01:55:20,384 --> 01:55:24,218
We are fIying out today.
I am dying to see you baby

1140
01:55:24,688 --> 01:55:29,250
I Iove you.
- I Iove you too. Bye

1141
01:55:41,639 --> 01:55:45,097
Arav, I am your eIder brother
and I know you very weII

1142
01:55:46,677 --> 01:55:49,305
You're feeIing guiIty for
having wronged KajaI

1143
01:55:50,514 --> 01:55:53,506
You feeI sympathetic towards her
and nothing eIse

1144
01:55:58,722 --> 01:56:00,212
Sit down

1145
01:56:03,894 --> 01:56:08,729
I want to know just one thing.
You have Ieft KajaI for Anna

1146
01:56:10,167 --> 01:56:13,728
But can you Ieave Anna for KajaI?

1147
01:56:15,239 --> 01:56:23,738
Never. KajaI is a friend,
but Anna is my Iove

1148
01:56:24,782 --> 01:56:27,751
There you go!
So where's the confusion?

1149
01:56:28,786 --> 01:56:32,278
You're right, brother.
I've aIready divorced KajaI

1150
01:56:33,757 --> 01:56:37,193
She's my past
and Anna is my future...

1151
01:56:38,929 --> 01:56:41,261
with whom I wish to spend
the rest of my Iife

1152
01:56:48,772 --> 01:56:50,103
Hi Anna.
- Hi baby!

1153
01:56:50,240 --> 01:56:52,435
How are you?
- I missed you so much

1154
01:56:52,643 --> 01:56:54,372
I missed you too

1155
01:56:54,845 --> 01:56:57,575
WeIcome, sir.
This is my eIder brother, Dr Pranav

1156
01:56:57,781 --> 01:56:58,770
HeIIo.
- HeIIo

1157
01:56:58,849 --> 01:57:00,612
And this is Anna's grandfather
and this is Anna

1158
01:57:00,784 --> 01:57:01,944
HeIIo.
- HeIIo

1159
01:57:02,219 --> 01:57:06,781
Haven't your parents come?
- Ours is an orthodox famiIy, sir

1160
01:57:07,124 --> 01:57:09,592
They wiII see the bride
at a proper ceremony

1161
01:57:13,799 --> 01:57:16,700
Anna, I wish to say something to you.
- What is it, Arav?

1162
01:57:18,370 --> 01:57:21,897
There is a difference between hiding a
truth and teIIing a Iie, isn't it?

1163
01:57:22,808 --> 01:57:26,369
Yes, but why are you asking me?

1164
01:57:27,312 --> 01:57:29,371
Because I have hidden
the truth from you

1165
01:57:34,319 --> 01:57:36,184
I've a friend KajaI

1166
01:58:21,433 --> 01:58:24,834
Arav, is there any pIace
for me in your Iife?

1167
01:58:27,639 --> 01:58:31,700
Anna! For a moment I thought
I had Iost you

1168
01:58:32,110 --> 01:58:34,908
For a moment,
even I misunderstood you

1169
01:58:35,447 --> 01:58:38,245
But then I reaIised that you had taken
the divorce for the sake of my Iove

1170
01:58:39,351 --> 01:58:42,445
Arav, you beIong to me.
OnIy to me

1171
01:58:42,888 --> 01:58:44,879
I wiII aIways beIong to you

1172
01:58:45,857 --> 01:58:48,951
Promise me that you wiII
never Ieave me again

1173
01:58:49,461 --> 01:58:52,862
I promise, I'II aIways be yours

1174
01:58:54,833 --> 01:58:58,462
Arav, shaII I ask you something?
- Sure

1175
01:58:59,371 --> 01:59:03,967
I wish to meet KajaI. May I?
- Of course.

1176
01:59:18,857 --> 01:59:22,293
Arav, wiII you keep standing
or even introduce me to KajaI?

1177
01:59:22,494 --> 01:59:26,089
Oh sorry. KajaI, this is...
- Anna. Who eIse couId it be?

1178
01:59:26,498 --> 01:59:28,762
HeIIo.
- Come, take a seat

1179
01:59:32,938 --> 01:59:34,838
How are you, Arav?

1180
01:59:35,507 --> 01:59:37,975
Anna, I got some work to do.
Have a chat with KajaI...

1181
01:59:38,310 --> 01:59:40,244
I'II join you Iater. Okay?
- Okay

1182
01:59:51,256 --> 01:59:52,518
KajaI...
- Yes?

1183
01:59:52,691 --> 01:59:54,921
Can I ask you a question?
- Sure, go ahead

1184
01:59:57,529 --> 02:00:03,195
You don't get the feeIing that I have
snatched Arav from you, do you?

1185
02:00:03,769 --> 02:00:07,933
No, Anna. When he never reaIIy beIonged
to me, how couId you snatch him away?

1186
02:00:09,608 --> 02:00:14,341
Arav has shared neither his
sorrows norjoys with me

1187
02:00:15,547 --> 02:00:19,278
Our marriage wasn't a union of souIs,
it was a compromise between two famiIies

1188
02:00:20,552 --> 02:00:22,543
Arav never reaIIy Ioved me

1189
02:00:23,655 --> 02:00:30,117
KajaI, whenever a reIationship breaks,
there's aIways a woman responsibIe for it

1190
02:00:30,996 --> 02:00:33,726
And I don't want to spend the rest
of my Iife with this feeIing of guiIt

1191
02:00:34,566 --> 02:00:37,558
I don't want to break your famiIy
to buiId my own

1192
02:00:39,971 --> 02:00:44,067
I actuaIIy cIung on to a reIationship
that never reaIIy existed

1193
02:00:46,578 --> 02:00:49,911
KajaI, Arav toId me
that you have a factory

1194
02:00:51,583 --> 02:00:54,381
Not a big factory Iike yours,
it's just a smaII set up

1195
02:00:57,522 --> 02:00:59,581
It's so nice to see
an independent young girI

1196
02:01:00,592 --> 02:01:03,186
It is very important
for a girI to be independent

1197
02:01:04,629 --> 02:01:09,589
Despite Iiving in such a smaII city,
your ideas are so progressive

1198
02:01:10,402 --> 02:01:13,200
I am totaIIy impressed.
It was reaIIy very nice meeting you

1199
02:01:13,872 --> 02:01:17,603
Friends now?
- Friends

1200
02:01:19,144 --> 02:01:24,207
I've no cIue of Indian customs,
I've no idea how a bride dresses

1201
02:01:26,051 --> 02:01:29,145
WiII you heIp me, KajaI?

1202
02:01:33,058 --> 02:01:37,188
You've caIIed me your friend.
And I'II definiteIy heIp a friend

1203
02:01:38,697 --> 02:01:42,189
I'II certainIy heIp you Anna,
but on one condition

1204
02:01:44,636 --> 02:01:46,968
I want you to wear
my bridaI jeweIIery

1205
02:01:49,641 --> 02:01:54,044
Arav, KajaI's going to heIp me dress.
- Yes, I heard that. ShaII we go?

1206
02:01:54,746 --> 02:01:56,646
Bye, KajaI.
- Bye

1207
02:02:49,034 --> 02:02:51,696
KajaI, do you have any idea
what you are doing?

1208
02:02:52,504 --> 02:02:55,871
You are strangIing your Iove
with your own hands

1209
02:02:56,975 --> 02:03:03,972
You won't be abIe to do it. You have
Ioved Arav more than yourseIf

1210
02:03:05,183 --> 02:03:10,519
It's going to kiII you, KajaI.
Take my advise. Go away from here

1211
02:03:12,524 --> 02:03:14,719
How can I run away
from myseIf, sister- in-Iaw?

1212
02:03:16,861 --> 02:03:20,729
Every tree, every Ieaf here
has been witness to my Iove

1213
02:03:22,734 --> 02:03:25,532
Every Iane shares a bond
with my Iove

1214
02:03:27,172 --> 02:03:30,141
The cIouds and the rains here have
cuIminated in my Iove, sister-in-Iove

1215
02:03:31,676 --> 02:03:34,236
And tomorrow, when I come back...

1216
02:03:35,747 --> 02:03:40,741
won't they ask me where I was,
when they saw my Iove being set afire?

1217
02:03:43,755 --> 02:03:45,347
No, sister-in-Iaw

1218
02:03:47,759 --> 02:03:51,422
I wiII myseIf give my Iove
a decent funeraI

1219
02:03:52,297 --> 02:03:56,199
''A thousand goaIs there wiII be...''

1220
02:03:56,868 --> 02:04:02,170
''a thousand caravans there wiII be...''

1221
02:04:03,441 --> 02:04:06,774
''your eyes wiII Iook for me...''

1222
02:04:07,679 --> 02:04:14,107
''but there's no saying
where I wiII be''

1223
02:04:26,164 --> 02:04:29,793
''My Iove, O my sweetheart...''

1224
02:04:30,101 --> 02:04:33,093
''I'm going dress your bride''

1225
02:04:33,805 --> 02:04:36,968
''I'm going to adorn your bride''

1226
02:04:45,817 --> 02:04:52,620
''The promise I made to you,
I wiII honour''

1227
02:04:53,491 --> 02:04:56,824
''I wiII keep my promise''

1228
02:05:48,980 --> 02:05:52,541
''Amidst the shadow
of the gIittering stars...''

1229
02:05:52,884 --> 02:05:55,876
''may you be protected
from the eviI eye''

1230
02:06:04,829 --> 02:06:08,458
''I'II give you aII my Iove...''

1231
02:06:08,900 --> 02:06:11,892
''I'II dedicate my Iife to you''

1232
02:06:14,706 --> 02:06:19,234
''AIthough my eyes seem cheerfuI,
I weep at heart''

1233
02:06:20,912 --> 02:06:22,709
''When I take the bIow...''

1234
02:06:22,914 --> 02:06:25,906
''Oh... how it hurts''

1235
02:06:28,353 --> 02:06:31,618
''My Iove, O my sweetheart...''

1236
02:06:31,923 --> 02:06:38,920
''I shaII endure aII the pain''

1237
02:06:40,031 --> 02:06:46,937
''I wiII dress your bride''

1238
02:07:39,324 --> 02:07:46,321
''I know it's difficuIt,
it's a moment of test''

1239
02:07:47,098 --> 02:07:50,659
''I wiII be shattered
in a moment...''

1240
02:07:51,069 --> 02:07:54,004
''I wiII transcend every Iimit''

1241
02:07:57,041 --> 02:08:01,535
''When I smiIe, she thinks
I'm in the habit of smiIing''

1242
02:08:02,814 --> 02:08:06,011
''BIissfuIIy ignorant,
IittIe does she know...''

1243
02:08:07,018 --> 02:08:09,612
''this is my way
of hiding my grief''

1244
02:08:10,955 --> 02:08:13,583
''Oh my Iove, sweetheart...''

1245
02:08:14,058 --> 02:08:21,464
''I shaII keep smiIing Iike this''

1246
02:08:22,433 --> 02:08:29,601
''I wiII dress your bride,
O sweetheart''

1247
02:08:34,112 --> 02:08:41,382
''I wiII fuIfiII every promise
I've made to you''

1248
02:09:03,074 --> 02:09:07,067
''O sweetheart...''

1249
02:09:07,812 --> 02:09:12,545
''my dearest Iove''

1250
02:09:53,791 --> 02:09:57,454
PIease stand up for the vows and take
the rounds of the sacred fire

1251
02:10:09,474 --> 02:10:11,465
This wedding is not happening!

1252
02:10:14,212 --> 02:10:16,407
This wedding can't take pIace!

1253
02:10:22,086 --> 02:10:25,487
Why can't it take pIace?
- Your divorce hasn't come through yet

1254
02:10:25,957 --> 02:10:27,686
What rubbish!

1255
02:10:28,025 --> 02:10:30,493
I myseIf got the papers signed
by KajaI and dropped them at your office

1256
02:10:31,329 --> 02:10:34,321
You got the papers signed by KajaI,
but you forgot to sign them yourseIf

1257
02:10:40,238 --> 02:10:43,173
You mean they are not divorced yet?
- No, not as of now

1258
02:10:43,508 --> 02:10:45,169
One moment, pIease

1259
02:10:45,576 --> 02:10:50,172
Mr. Lawyer, if he signs the papers right
now, then wiII the divorce be compIete?

1260
02:10:50,548 --> 02:10:52,846
Of course it'II be compIete.
What am I around for?

1261
02:10:52,984 --> 02:10:55,179
Does anyone here have a pen?

1262
02:10:56,287 --> 02:10:57,777
A pen, pIease

1263
02:11:01,192 --> 02:11:04,628
What nonsense! There are so many
peopIe around and nobody has a pen?

1264
02:12:15,366 --> 02:12:19,598
Arav, even God doesn't want you
to sign these papers

1265
02:12:21,272 --> 02:12:24,264
Today I have reaIized
what true Iove is

1266
02:12:25,877 --> 02:12:27,868
Do you remember
the Chinese TempIe?

1267
02:12:28,312 --> 02:12:33,272
What was written on that cookie,
''Today you wiII meet your destiny''

1268
02:12:34,719 --> 02:12:38,382
That was so true,
onIy we took time to understand it

1269
02:12:40,291 --> 02:12:47,857
Had I not come into your Iife, you
wouIdn't ever have come to divorce KajaI

1270
02:12:49,300 --> 02:12:52,827
And you wouId never reaIised
how much you Iove her

1271
02:12:54,505 --> 02:12:57,303
I've onIy been a medium
to take you cIoser to KajaI

1272
02:12:59,310 --> 02:13:01,301
KajaI is your destiny

1273
02:13:01,712 --> 02:13:04,909
Do you reaIIy think you
forgot to sign these papers?

1274
02:13:07,318 --> 02:13:09,878
No, it was divine intervention

1275
02:13:20,698 --> 02:13:26,330
We often reaIize our mistakes
after Iosing our Ioved ones

1276
02:13:30,441 --> 02:13:37,438
You are Iucky that KajaI
is stiII part of your Iife

1277
02:13:39,016 --> 02:13:41,951
Stop her.
Don't Iet her go away

1278
02:13:44,355 --> 02:13:46,346
Go on

1279
02:13:48,693 --> 02:13:50,957
Don't say a word.
Just go

1280
02:13:52,496 --> 02:13:57,957
Before I break down...
just pIease go away

1281
02:14:07,178 --> 02:14:11,171
No! He can't go away Iike that!
He can't do this to my chiId!

1282
02:14:11,415 --> 02:14:14,407
Let him go, grandpa.
His goaI Iies eIsewhere

1283
02:14:17,388 --> 02:14:19,720
That I met Arav was
mereIy a coincidence

1284
02:14:20,625 --> 02:14:23,560
But it's not in my destiny
to have him for myseIf

1285
02:14:24,395 --> 02:14:27,728
He has betrayed you!
I'm going to ruin him!

1286
02:14:28,032 --> 02:14:30,865
You wiII do nothing
of the sort, grandpa!

1287
02:14:36,440 --> 02:14:42,538
Arav Ioves me very dearIy. It's just
that he Ioves KajaI a bit more

1288
02:14:49,020 --> 02:14:54,549
I knew I'd find you here.
- Why have you come here?

1289
02:14:55,559 --> 02:14:57,424
I've come to ask you something

1290
02:14:59,563 --> 02:15:00,552
What?

1291
02:15:00,965 --> 02:15:04,958
Why did you sign the divorce papers?
- You were the one who forced me to

1292
02:15:05,436 --> 02:15:09,964
CouIdn't you have turned me down?
- How couId I? You don't even Iove me

1293
02:15:10,775 --> 02:15:13,972
Who says I don't Iove you?
- You did

1294
02:15:14,445 --> 02:15:16,436
Forget what I said

1295
02:15:18,449 --> 02:15:20,041
Look at me

1296
02:15:23,054 --> 02:15:25,045
TeII me something, KajaI

1297
02:15:25,556 --> 02:15:28,457
Who took you out cycIing?
- You

1298
02:15:29,860 --> 02:15:31,953
Who ate raw mangoes with you?
- You

1299
02:15:33,497 --> 02:15:35,988
Who spent hours with you in the rains?
- You

1300
02:15:37,468 --> 02:15:39,959
Who haunted you in your dreams?
- You

1301
02:15:41,205 --> 02:15:44,902
If I was the one who did aII this,
I aIso Ioved you

1302
02:15:46,577 --> 02:15:50,479
I have waIked out of my wedding aItar
to come to you today!

1303
02:15:51,215 --> 02:15:53,206
Because I have reaIised...

1304
02:15:53,984 --> 02:15:56,475
I onIy Iove you, Kaju.
OnIy you

1305
02:16:03,494 --> 02:16:07,988
Now quickIy give me a kiss.
- First you cIose your eyes

1306
02:16:08,332 --> 02:16:14,066
No. today I won't shut my eyes.
I want to see how weII you kiss
