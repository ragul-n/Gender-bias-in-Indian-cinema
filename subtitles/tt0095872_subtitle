00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:20,794
Library

2
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:18,794
'The Birth'

3
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:14,794
-Marar, does the Library closed so early today?
-Wind makes the things there worse.
-Are you going to the other side?
I'm going to market.

4
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:23,794
-Why to the market?
-Bus may be late today.
-It'll arrive at sharp 7.10.

5
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:32,794
Today Raghu will come.
In his letter, it is said that
he'll come by today's last bus.

6
00:06:58,330 --> 00:06:59,794
Rain hasn't come.

7
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:02,794
It'll come late.

8
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:15,794
Father

9
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:20,794
Has Raghu come?

10
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:28,794
Not yet mother. He may be with father.

11
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:47,794
Isn't Raghu in the bus?

12
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:09,794
Today's newspaper. Give it to Marar sir.
He went to house so early because
of the fear of rain.

13
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:12,794
It's ok. I'll hand over it
to Raghu's father.

14
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:27,794
-What is this? Is there no rain here?
There was heavy rain before arriving here.
-Anyway, by driving bus in rain
and arriving a place that has no rain
is a relief.
-Yes, big relief!

15
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:39,794
Hari, didn't see him.
Hasn't Raghu come?

16
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:48,794
Maybe..
he didn't say anything to me.
Thought he is in this bus.

17
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:57,794
Has son not come?
I come back after taking
them on the other side.

18
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:02,794
Don't worry. He'll come tomorrow.

19
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:52,794
-Was Raghu come with that group?
-No, he hasn't come.

20
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:58,794
He also said nothing.

21
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:13,794
-Can you wait?,
i'll look there one more time.
-Isn't that boy said he didn't see
Raghu in the bus. Then why..?
You please come.

22
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:47,794
You don't need to fear about it.
There may be some reason for him
to not come today.

23
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:55,794
What reason he should have?
Doesn't he know 
this old man will get frightened?

24
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:03,794
Raghu will come.
There is bus on tomorrow and day after tomorrow.

25
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:10,794
If you paddle little more fast,
i can see Hari and ask him one more time.

26
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:56,794
It's too late. How can we ask him
at this time? I can't stand because
of the corn on the foot. Let's go back.

27
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:11,794
Shall i return? See you tomorrow.

28
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:44,794
-Has Raghu come?
-No. Waited for so long.
That Hari also hasn't said anything.
-Has Hari come?

29
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:54,794
He may have come. Doesn't he know
the thing about tomorrow?
Did you look there well?

30
00:15:56,330 --> 00:16:00,794
In this darkness, you too want
to go there and look for him?
Then look.

31
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:23,794
Father hasn't wash the legs.
Give me the shirt. Will bring
water for bathing.

32
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:26,794
Isn't today's date is 17th?

33
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:30,794
-Yes.
-So the date is also correct.

34
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:56,794
Only very much oil in the bottle.
Raghu will bring it when he comes.

35
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:33,794
Unni (nickname of Raghu), don't run like this
after applying oil.
Your sister can't run along with you.

36
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:51,794
You think you can run all the time?
I won't let you go anymore.

37
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:27,794
-Father, water is ready.
-You go and sleep kid.
Cold water is enough dear,
let everything get cool down.

38
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:32,794
Don't go for new habits.

39
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:59,794
Father, the heat of
water will lose.

40
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:12,794
Mother, with this disease,
if you don't eat tablets..

41
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:26,794
Very few of it is remaining.
Only get when Raghu comes. So i..

42
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:54,794
What is that sound?
Has he fallen down?

43
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:07,794
Lord..

44
00:22:42,330 --> 00:23:10,794
Kid, how many of it has you lightened? Three?
There is not much problem in my eye power.
Hasn't Unni said,
there is a date for my cataract surgery?
He'll take me only to a hospital
that don't hurt me.

45
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:39,794
She also has come early.
I told her about the Bride Seeing.

46
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:09,794
Go to uncle's house and tell him
to postpone the date. Raghu hasn't come.
Without Unni, nothing goes well.

47
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:15,794
-Why he hasn't come?
-You go there quickly.

48
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:22,794
I will fall down, after walking through
all these paddy fields and climbing hills.

49
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:38,794
That's not right. Let them come.
Malathi is saying..
He's not on the chair.
Where has he gone?

50
00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:04,794
What..?
Bus is only at evening.

51
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:59,794
What happened to him?
There is some problem..else
he was not like this.

52
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:17,794
-Give me a tea.
-Let the water boils.

53
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:42,794
Haven't i told you the bus
is not at this time.

54
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:57,794
No need to wait for him here everyday.
He'll come.

55
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:06,794
It's because of your compulsion,
i come with the canoe this early.

56
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:33,794
It's not right waiting for the bus here,
while people come to see Malathi.

57
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:38,794
Without my son's coming,
what is the use in coming of any others?

58
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:12,794
-The service of morning bus has stopped.
-You're the one who is showing quickness.

59
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:24,794
Being late one day is common.

60
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:33,794
I'm sure Raghu will come in the evening bus.

61
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:36,794
What's the time right now?

62
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:52,794
What the hell is this?
Telling them to come, then telling
not to come. How things will happen
if you behave like this?

63
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:29,794
How many of the same is happened up to now?
What if, they don't want to come
another day? The thing you did is rogueness.

64
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:42,794
Without Raghu how things will happen?
Along that, what if a fear also emerge?
Then i will be like a dead body.

65
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:53,794
What all things are these people saying?
Why you keep locking Raghu's room?
When he comes,
the room will be seen in a dirty state.

66
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:58,794
I think they will not come.
Do sister has nothing to say?

67
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:05,794
-Who is behind you, like a shade?
-That's me itself.

68
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:46,794
Sister, have you noticed the door you entered?
Opposite that, have you noticed the arch made
of laterite stone, and the beauty of
light falling on it?

69
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:59,794
Look through this window.
Look how the things outside,
the front yard, red soil path..are beautifully connected; same like the
relationship of us who live inside.

70
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:18,794
-What you mean?
-I'm trying to relate the old vastu shilpa
and new engineering. Sometimes i think,
the old ones are always strong.
-You're right. By standing from this ascension
you should find new sciences.

71
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:12,794
-Stop it you donkey.
Is this a fire service lorry?
-Many are catching frogs behind,
they should also hear it.

72
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:30,794
You said you are in a leave today.

73
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:32,794
No need for the leave.

74
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:38,794
Is a brother of teacher
studying for engineering?

75
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:44,794
-Yes.
-What is his name?
-Raghu.

76
00:32:51,330 --> 00:33:02,794
-What is the matter?
-I asked for no particular reason.
It's difficult to get
such a seat nowadays.

77
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:12,794
Teacher hasn't signed.

78
00:33:35,330 --> 00:34:00,794
I went to that Hari's house again.
The people there don't even think
a human was come to see them.
Since my Raghu is studying with their Hari,
to where i go to enquire about him first?

79
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:12,794
He'll come by this bus..sure.

80
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:45,794
-What is the balance?
-3 rupees 20 paise.
-Here it is the 3 rupees..everything right?

81
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:24,794
-Got anything?
-Why not? Am i the Conductor?!

82
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:46,794
Father, don't you want to bath?

83
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:17,794
Two Pushpanjali and one Mruthyanjaya homam.

84
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:42,794
Lord..

85
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:32,794
You hasn't said anything, though
father visited you many times.

86
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:54,794
Now i'm in a self purification mode.
And under a 'home jail' too.
These vazhipadu (offerings) are made
by my mother, for the escape of me
from bad friends.

87
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:09,794
Today is Raghu's birth star.
Where is he?
Tell me the truth.
Don't you know anything?

88
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:12,794
Something has written in newspaper.

89
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:17,794
Lord..my brother..

90
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:30,794
Before the exam ends,
police came and took Raghu.
They are from special branch.
Four men including Raghu was in the group.
How can i say these things to your father?

91
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:46,794
There is nothing in it.
That's in it.

92
00:43:34,330 --> 00:43:35,794
Why didn't you tell about it?

93
00:43:50,330 --> 00:44:08,794
I'm unable to tell it.
At least, for that much time
you two don't feel sad.

94
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:16,794
At least, we could do something.

95
00:44:19,330 --> 00:44:33,794
In newspaper, it is said that
they released him in the next day itself
from the custody. I thought
he may went back to college without
coming here.

96
00:44:35,330 --> 00:44:36,794
He was your only son.

97
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:07,794
I've heard everything.

98
00:45:41,330 --> 00:45:45,794
Never mind what it is written in newspaper.
Should search Raghu.
I'm going to Thiruvananthapuram.

99
00:49:20,330 --> 00:49:25,794
This is my leave letter.
Please tell it to the head master.
Don't forget.

100
00:50:50,330 --> 00:50:57,794
You should come early tomorrow.
I need to go to Thiruvananthapuram.
Take care.

101
00:51:18,330 --> 00:51:45,794
-Shankara, the heat of tea may have lost.
-With this feet i need an hour to walk a feet.
-Shankara, i need to say something to you.
The coins you give me to keep is filling the bag more and more. I fear to keep it here.
-Is your bag full?

102
00:51:57,330 --> 00:52:00,794
If you consider your daughter
as my daughter too, then problem
will be solved.

103
00:52:48,330 --> 00:52:57,794
Decided to go early morning, so that will not miss the bus.
Since i lost my sleep, i don't miss the time too.

104
00:54:05,330 --> 00:54:15,794
You're lucky. Here is the bus.
Without walking more, you can travel
effortlessly and bring Raghu back.
God is with you.

105
00:54:48,330 --> 00:55:07,794
Are you going to Thiruvananthapuram?
That Nambeeshan is the minister now.
Devaki Aunt's family helped him for studying.
Go and meet him, and tell about those.
He will help.

106
00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:35,794
Wake up.

107
00:56:20,330 --> 00:57:00,794
Shankara, my father is still thinking
i'm that small 'Unni'. He gets terrified
even if i'm late for a very few minutes.
I was born to him at his late age. May because
of that he's more affectionate.

108
00:57:01,330 --> 00:57:17,794
-How's your foot corn after applying
the medicine i gave?
-Feels better, but don't know what i do
after the medicine gets finished.
-Don't worry about it as long as i live.
I'll bring a new medicine for you next time.

109
00:58:23,330 --> 00:58:46,794
-Is the Swami of Ulsava Madom still the owner?
-Yes. But he is on his deathbed.
-I arrived here and met him,
when the king ordered me to come.
So many years have passed.
-Only this is left for him, everything
else is taken by the government.

110
00:59:20,330 --> 00:59:21,794
Bathroom is downstairs.

111
00:59:23,330 --> 00:59:38,794
Omanathinkal Kidavo..(a lullaby)

112
01:01:10,330 --> 01:01:46,794
[Memories about Raghu's childhood]

113
01:03:22,330 --> 01:03:37,794
Is it Kurup? They are ready to
give two cars. Bring your other 'party' too.
It is very cold in Thekkady. Should
take what all we need.

114
01:03:47,330 --> 01:03:50,794
Kerala Government

115
01:04:10,330 --> 01:04:20,794
Yes. This is Home Minister's house.
He went to a conference. Will return
after 2 O'clock.

116
01:04:30,330 --> 01:04:34,794
He went to a conference. Will return
after 2 O'clock.

117
01:04:46,330 --> 01:04:55,794
I've sent that file to office, Sir.
Secretary will reach at 7 O'clock.
I've collected all the files.

118
01:06:10,330 --> 01:06:26,794
Yes. I'm Nambeeshan. I'm going
to meet the Chief Minister afternoon.
Everything should happen.. will happen.

119
01:06:29,330 --> 01:06:30,794
Have you eaten lunch?

120
01:06:48,330 --> 01:06:53,794
I'm going to Delhi this evening.
Let's do one thing. I'll give a
letter to I. G. (Inspector General).
Just give it to him.

121
01:06:56,330 --> 01:06:57,794
Draft a letter to I. G.

122
01:07:28,330 --> 01:07:30,794
Don't allow anybody to come
inside for 5 minutes.

123
01:08:21,330 --> 01:08:23,794
-Give this to I. G.
-Where is he?

124
01:08:27,330 --> 01:08:28,794
Don't you know I. G.'s office?

125
01:09:05,330 --> 01:09:08,794
Show him the room of D. G. P. (Director General of Police).
Go with him.

126
01:09:13,330 --> 01:09:15,794
Sir, the man which is said by minister
is coming upstairs.

127
01:10:57,330 --> 01:11:00,794
The things are already finished.
He's not in our custody.

128
01:11:01,330 --> 01:11:02,794
The police here had taken him.

129
01:11:03,330 --> 01:11:20,794
Hey..they didn't take him like that.
May called him just to ask something.
But there is no records regarding it.
Don't worry, he will arrive there soon.

130
01:11:28,330 --> 01:11:29,794
Until now, he hasn't reached.

131
01:11:40,330 --> 01:11:41,794
He was the only one i have.

132
01:11:59,330 --> 01:12:06,794
Please give him back.
If need, i give another letter.

133
01:12:08,330 --> 01:12:12,794
He'll come back. I'll inquire.

134
01:12:23,330 --> 01:12:27,794
Bless you.
For this great heart,
God will give what you deserve.

135
01:12:36,330 --> 01:12:43,794
They are the ones who tell us to take
under custody and handle.
But when we handle, the story will end.
Since they knew it well, then why sending
these old men to here.

136
01:12:45,330 --> 01:12:49,794
-His family gave support for the studies
of the leader.
-Then why don't consider it as a payback?

137
01:13:51,330 --> 01:13:52,794
Is Raghu here?

138
01:14:01,330 --> 01:14:02,794
Who hold my hand?

139
01:15:13,330 --> 01:15:31,794
-Have you seen Raghu?
-He's not with them.
They already released him.
Nobody took him under custody.
-Who said all these things to you?
-I.G.
-What if that was a lie?
-Lie? For telling lie, are they
put uniform and sit there?
-What you inquire actually?

140
01:15:39,330 --> 01:15:42,794
They took our Raghu. That's the truth.

141
01:15:46,330 --> 01:15:48,794
But they told me, they released him.

142
01:16:00,330 --> 01:16:03,794
Then, where is he?
To whom you ask all these?

143
01:16:30,330 --> 01:16:32,794
Is it a lie they told?

144
01:16:36,330 --> 01:17:00,794
Do you remember that Nambeeshan
who tied a golden chain on Raghu's waist
on his birthday, when he was a child?
He is the minister now.
Did he knot it on my neck actually?

145
01:17:23,330 --> 01:17:35,794
Not enough sugar.
You should have told me when sugar is finished.
Instead of it, don't give sugarless tea.

146
01:17:53,330 --> 01:17:54,794
Is Aunt inside?

147
01:17:59,330 --> 01:18:01,794
Has Raghu arrived?

148
01:18:08,330 --> 01:18:22,794
I came here for a help.
Mother is seriously ill.
How can i go to school,
by leaving her alone in the home?

149
01:18:23,330 --> 01:18:25,794
-So what she is suppose to do?
-Don't get angry at her.

150
01:18:27,330 --> 01:18:40,794
-Where is Janu?
-What is the benefit in it?
She's not a relative. Can you sent
Savitri to there for help?

151
01:18:41,330 --> 01:18:55,794
No.
I'm not ready to sent my daughter
for such a help.
I already got ashamed from all these.
Enough?

152
01:19:31,330 --> 01:19:55,794
-Never mind the shouting of Uncle.
-I thought Aunt would sent Savitri.
-She'll sent her. Sure.

153
01:19:57,330 --> 01:20:14,794
-Father is very tired too. Hope
Raghu will not disppear from us.
I feel scared teacher.
-Don't worry. Nothing bad will happen.

154
01:20:18,330 --> 01:20:54,794
-I'm going to Thiruvananthapuram.
Need to find him.
-When?
-Father believed everything they told.
His pain may be a joke to them.
-You go and meet Raghu's friends there.
They won't tell lie to you.

155
01:21:28,330 --> 01:21:32,794
Hey, come and look.
A chick has come there.

156
01:21:40,330 --> 01:21:50,794
On college day, Raghu mock minister
through a song. That was the beginning.
Johnny is the last one who came out
from police custody. He said,
Raghu was in the lock up.

157
01:21:51,330 --> 01:21:53,794
I'm going to see a lawyer.
Can you help me?

158
01:21:54,330 --> 01:22:18,794
-But they told they didn't take him under custody?
-There may be witnesses.
-To whom these witnesses should tell the truth?
To police? They are the one who took Raghu.
-What should i do?
He's the only one who we had.
To whom i should ask about him?

159
01:22:22,330 --> 01:22:24,794
I need to see his room.

160
01:24:42,330 --> 01:24:58,794
Dear father, exam will end soon.
I've bought the medicine for mother.
Met the doctor for the surgery yesterday.
Tell mother, there will be no pain.
I'll come on 17th. No need to come and wait
for me in the market. I'll come by myself.
People who come to see sister..

161
01:25:04,330 --> 01:25:21,794

162
01:25:37,330 --> 01:25:47,794
There will be some way.
After college reopens students will arrive.
May i tell a doubt? But don't feel hurt.

163
01:26:38,330 --> 01:27:18,794
[Memories about Raghu's childhood]

164
01:29:27,330 --> 01:29:32,794
Did they tell you the same lies,
which they told me.

165
01:29:39,330 --> 01:29:42,794
Lord..i don't have the strength to reply.

166
01:29:46,330 --> 01:29:47,794
Yes.

167
01:29:55,330 --> 01:29:57,794
Only expect Raghu will come.

168
01:30:04,330 --> 01:30:06,794
Please don't wait for him all the time
like this.

169
01:30:08,330 --> 01:30:24,794
What? No need to wait?
Then why i'm his father?,
Why she is his mother? Why you are his sister?
And telling not to wait! Lord..

170
01:33:58,330 --> 01:34:00,794
Swelling in stomach.
Very much pain.

171
01:34:11,330 --> 01:34:15,794
Everything will be alright.
Don't fear.
Tell the kid not to cry.

172
01:35:19,330 --> 01:35:20,794
Bus will arrive soon.

173
01:37:53,330 --> 01:37:54,330
Teacher..

174
01:39:31,330 --> 01:39:48,794
Raghu..so you came at last.
Hold my hand strongly son,
so that your father won't fall down.

175
01:39:56,330 --> 01:40:00,794
Devaki, Unni has arrived.
Malathi, here is your brother.

176
01:40:03,330 --> 01:40:07,794
Come fast dear.
Sister is eagerly waiting for you.

177
01:40:13,330 --> 01:40:15,794
No need to wash legs, Unni.
You come inside.

178
01:40:26,330 --> 01:40:40,794
He only was in the bus.
There was no other passenger in it.
Are you happy now?

179
01:40:46,330 --> 01:41:01,794
You feel very sad
by waiting for so long, is it?
Raghu, seek the blessing
from your mother first.
Why are you silent?

180
01:41:09,330 --> 01:41:10,794
He seeked my blessings.

181
01:41:11,330 --> 01:41:28,794
Devaki, we don't sent him
anywhere anymore.
