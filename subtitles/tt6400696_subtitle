1
00:01:21,649 --> 00:01:25,065
"You ripped it apart."

2
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:31,132
"My love from your heart."

3
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:36,805
"Now two relationships
between us ain't pretty."

4
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:42,503
"It's love and enmity."

5
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,083
"It's love and enmity."

6
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:52,788
"I cried a lot reading your letters."

7
00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:55,556
"Now I just keep staring
at your memories."

8
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:58,063
"I just keep staring
at your memories."

9
00:01:58,151 --> 00:01:59,928
"In your heart."

10
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:03,528
"In your heart you
had so much hidden.."

11
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:06,129
"if knew I would've
never fallen in love with you."

12
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:08,573
"I would've never
fallen in love with you."

13
00:02:08,896 --> 00:02:11,401
"if knew I would've
never fallen in love with you."

14
00:02:11,532 --> 00:02:13,946
"I would've never
fallen in love with you."

15
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:16,774
"if knew I would've
never fallen in love with you."

16
00:02:16,904 --> 00:02:20,981
"I would've never
fallen in love with you."

17
00:02:28,516 --> 00:02:31,898
"You made me a million promises."

18
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,935
"Life is delicate,
our love couldn't survive

19
00:02:35,022 --> 00:02:37,095
"Our love couldn't survive"

20
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:38,964
"If it had been revealed.."

21
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:42,338
"If it had been revealed on time.."

22
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:47,110
"I would've never trusted you.
I would've never loved you."

23
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,554
"I would've never trusted you.
I would've never loved you."

24
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:59,690
"I would've never trusted you.
I would've never loved you."

25
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:17,878
"Don't ever do what you did to me."

26
00:03:17,965 --> 00:03:21,177
"I congratulate you
on your new state of being."

27
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:23,476
"On your new state of being."

28
00:03:23,571 --> 00:03:25,142
"Why did I.."

29
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:28,587
"Why did I surrender my heart to you?"

30
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:31,522
"if knew I would've
never fallen in love with you."

31
00:03:31,612 --> 00:03:33,594
"I would've never
fallen in love with you."

32
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:38,725
"I would've never trusted you.
I would've never loved you."

33
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:41,894
"if knew I would've
never fallen in love with you."

34
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:43,993
"I would've never
fallen in love with you."

35
00:03:44,124 --> 00:03:51,914
"I would've never trusted you.
I would've never loved you."

36
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,131
So, where were we?

37
00:05:23,524 --> 00:05:25,563
Yes. sir.

38
00:05:27,227 --> 00:05:29,710
Sir, tell me

39
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:32,744
Speak up.

40
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:36,540
Say something at least.

41
00:05:36,804 --> 00:05:38,341
What will he say, milord?

42
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:40,944
His snoring has ruined my life

43
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:44,915
I don'! remember when
I last slept peacefully.

44
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:47,417
I have tried stuffed
cotton in my ears tying them

45
00:05:47,715 --> 00:05:48,820
Everything has failed.

46
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:53,096
He's so loud that not even
the cattle in my house can sleep

47
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:54,660
It has crossed all limits

48
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:56,800
Please free me from him.

49
00:05:59,126 --> 00:06:00,573
Did you too have a problem?

50
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:02,503
Speak up. Why don't you say it?

51
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,342
You have rendered
me speechless, fatso.

52
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:06,546
I am in court because of you.

53
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,114
Milord, my problem
is greater than hers

54
00:06:10,337 --> 00:06:11,818
Let me explain.

55
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:14,986
She keeps passing gas all night long.

56
00:06:15,643 --> 00:06:18,923
I spray perfume worth
thousands on the bed..

57
00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:24,496
...and her self-made gas
over powers it. It is deadly.

58
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:27,998
Sir, I have a request to make

59
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:30,900
If she wishes to pass gas,
it should be LPG.

60
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:32,935
It will help me fill a few cylinders

61
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:36,068
Milord..

62
00:06:36,296 --> 00:06:38,209
Order. Order.

63
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:40,003
Now what do I tell you?

64
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:45,210
I feel as if I am sleeping
in a gutter and not at home

65
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:53,093
There's more.

66
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:57,797
I wake up and she farts

67
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:01,927
Now you tell me,
who is in a bad state, she or me

68
00:07:03,624 --> 00:07:06,266
Don't you have any shame? Is
this how one should address his wife?

69
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:08,133
I am in court because of you.

70
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:09,299
I am here because of you, fatso.

71
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,605
Because of you, let me tell you.
Stop your nonsense. - Shut up.

72
00:07:11,832 --> 00:07:13,107
<i>I'll</i> teach you a lesson. - Shut up.

73
00:07:13,534 --> 00:07:14,342
Keep quiet.

74
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:16,981
Milord, I have no control over my gas.

75
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:18,083
It comes out when it has to.

76
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:20,119
Then fatso, even snoring
isn't something that I can control.

77
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:23,517
Milord, after all they
at least don't hurt the nose

78
00:07:23,611 --> 00:07:25,353
'What kind of a joke is this?

79
00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:29,961
You came to court
for such a small issue?

80
00:07:30,551 --> 00:07:32,395
Learn to tolerate a little

81
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:36,161
Sir, I have a solution.

82
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,063
You should tie a
tape across your nose

83
00:07:39,593 --> 00:07:43,203
That will stop the snoring.
You can get the tape from the chemist.

84
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:45,478
100% result guaranteed

85
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,078
Okay? - Yes

86
00:07:48,602 --> 00:07:50,914
Milord, I shall tie
a tape on my nose..

87
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,514
But please find a solution
to control her gas too.

88
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:56,923
You are making fun of me?
Don't you have any shame?

89
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:05,390
Order. Order. Order Enough of this.

90
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,162
At least take your
age into consideration.

91
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,401
Why are you guys fighting like kids?

92
00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:17,602
I have given you a solution.
Now I don't want any arguments.

93
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:22,276
In the next hearing we will
see if we have resolved this case.

94
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,977
Give them the date
for their next hearing.

95
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:27,748
Your next hearing will
be on the 16th of the next month

96
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:28,319
Okay?

97
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:30,345
Next case?

98
00:08:31,545 --> 00:08:33,891
Gunjan Kaur versus Ranbir Singh.

99
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:38,755
Sit.

100
00:08:46,694 --> 00:08:49,803
Milord, I am Bhagwan Singh
He's my client, Mr. Ranbir Singh.

101
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:53,807
Sir, I am Ishwar.
And I am Gunjan Kaur's lawyer.

102
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:07,293
The court is adjourned for lunch

103
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,554
You both listen to me

104
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:10,323
This is a new case A new hearing

105
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:13,697
The next hearing will
take place after 20 days. Okay?

106
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:17,935
Another hearing date?
It keeps getting postponed!

107
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:21,104
I never got justice! All I
get is the date for the next hearing..

108
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:25,670
What's wrong with him?

109
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:30,112
Sir, he doesn't like
cheating hence Sunny Leone's.

110
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:32,483
Hence Sunny Deol's takes over him

111
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,015
But who got cheated here?

112
00:09:35,643 --> 00:09:38,353
Him, sir.
His hearing keeps getting postponed

113
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:40,417
But this is the court's
blessed offering.

114
00:09:40,514 --> 00:09:44,898
Sir, why make so much offering
that you give it at every hearing?

115
00:09:45,786 --> 00:09:48,736
Now Binnu Dillion has taken over him.

116
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:50,692
N o.

117
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:56,168
The hearing gets postponed
to give you time to think

118
00:09:56,564 --> 00:09:58,944
You still have time to get together.

119
00:09:59,767 --> 00:10:01,406
The court will separate you otherwise.

120
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:03,545
I apologise, sir.

121
00:10:03,637 --> 00:10:06,483
After due consideration thinking
and when things cross the limit..

122
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,922
People come to court
as the last resort.

123
00:10:09,176 --> 00:10:11,750
Now who has taken over him?
- Masculinity.

124
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,757
You mean he was feminine earlier?

125
00:10:17,518 --> 00:10:26,914
Son, behave like counselors otherwise
you will be debarred from the court.

126
00:10:27,695 --> 00:10:30,405
Milord, I was just trying
to cheer up everyone

127
00:10:30,698 --> 00:10:32,110
Wonderful.

128
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:34,507
Hats off to you, oh great artist.

129
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:38,217
The stage is set,
the audience is ready, right?

130
00:10:38,772 --> 00:10:44,420
No, sir. I was trying to
cleanse the atmosphere of the court.

131
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:45,487
Wonderful.

132
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:48,588
You have cleansed it well.

133
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:54,303
If you try to do it again,
I will fill your life with pollution.

134
00:10:54,555 --> 00:10:55,260
Got it?

135
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:20,685
Hello?

136
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:21,718
Here.

137
00:11:23,984 --> 00:11:24,793
Cheers.

138
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:28,867
Look Ranbir, my advice to
you is that you and your wife.

139
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:31,193
...should resolve this
with mutual understanding.

140
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:34,536
This is what happens
in most of the divorce cases.

141
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,935
You are spending money on me.

142
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,143
Your wife is spending money on him

143
00:11:40,601 --> 00:11:42,411
In the end you will
have to compromise.

144
00:11:43,737 --> 00:11:48,589
Otherwise, spend some more money
and get out of it once and for all.

145
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:50,216
It's not about the money, brother.

146
00:11:50,611 --> 00:11:51,613
I want to teach her a lesson.

147
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:53,583
How dare she file a case against me!

148
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:57,491
She thinks she is very clever.
Now I will teach her a lesson.

149
00:11:57,751 --> 00:11:58,890
You tell me what I need to do.

150
00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:01,331
You made a very big mistake

151
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:02,490
'What do you mean?

152
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:05,336
I mean you should have
taught her a lesson at home.

153
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:06,899
Why did you leave the house?

154
00:12:06,994 --> 00:12:08,737
It has been a week
since I left the house.

155
00:12:08,996 --> 00:12:10,340
How can I go back now?

156
00:12:10,631 --> 00:12:14,207
Look Ranbir,
till your divorce is not finalized..

157
00:12:14,768 --> 00:12:17,547
No one can stop you from going home.

158
00:12:17,905 --> 00:12:19,214
Do one thing.

159
00:12:20,207 --> 00:12:23,487
Go home and ruin
your wife's happiness.

160
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:34,128
"Your father is not Laden,
who will kill with a bomb."

161
00:12:34,221 --> 00:12:40,109
"Your brother is not a crane, who can
lift people standing at the square."

162
00:12:44,832 --> 00:12:46,471
"Your beloved.."

163
00:12:49,036 --> 00:12:50,574
"The one who will kill.."

164
00:12:50,704 --> 00:12:51,547
<i>I'll</i> be right back

165
00:12:51,939 --> 00:12:54,582
"The one who will
kill everyone at sight.."

166
00:12:57,745 --> 00:13:01,286
Yes? What? - Why? This is my house
I want to come inside.

167
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:05,528
No. Leave or I will call the cops

168
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:07,965
I am scared.

169
00:13:11,525 --> 00:13:16,171
"Your father is not Laden,
who will kill with a bomb."

170
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:17,002
Nothing.

171
00:13:17,364 --> 00:13:22,979
"Your brother is not a crane, who can
lift people standing at the square."

172
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:26,782
"Your beloved will keep visiting you."

173
00:13:27,575 --> 00:13:31,116
<i>"I'll</i> get rid of anyone
who tries to stop me."

174
00:13:31,745 --> 00:13:40,264
"Your father is not Laden,
who will kill with a bomb."

175
00:13:40,353 --> 00:13:45,968
"Your brother is not a crane, who can
lift people standing at the square."

176
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:50,472
"Your beloved will keep visiting you."

177
00:13:50,898 --> 00:13:54,782
<i>"I'll</i> get rid of anyone
who tries to stop me."

178
00:13:55,135 --> 00:14:01,183
"The one who will
kill everyone at sight.."

179
00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:04,287
"Your mother is not a chainsaw.."

180
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,395
They are my friends.

181
00:14:14,522 --> 00:14:17,403
This is my party. Please leave.

182
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:19,561
They are my enemy.

183
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:23,143
I am going through a divorce
Please leave.

184
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:28,341
You guys, stay.
Ranbir, you should leave

185
00:14:29,903 --> 00:14:30,814
I am not going anywhere.

186
00:14:31,138 --> 00:14:35,147
Tell these ladies that the
party is over. They should leave.

187
00:14:35,442 --> 00:14:38,689
No one will leave. You go.

188
00:14:38,946 --> 00:14:41,691
This is my house,
so my orders will be followed.

189
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:43,790
Are you guys leaving or do
I need to explain it in Punjabi style?

190
00:14:47,588 --> 00:14:50,002
You cannot win

191
00:14:50,758 --> 00:14:52,706
Now let's see who wins or losses

192
00:14:59,432 --> 00:15:00,468
Get out!

193
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:09,143
No one will leave

194
00:15:09,543 --> 00:15:11,547
I am not scared of your misdeeds.

195
00:15:44,612 --> 00:15:45,420
You missed.

196
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:51,593
It's okay. I was anyway thirsty
<i>I'll</i> use it to drink water.

197
00:17:02,556 --> 00:17:03,558
Mrs Gunjan..

198
00:17:03,891 --> 00:17:04,927
Mrs Gunjan..

199
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:06,201
What have you done!

200
00:17:06,994 --> 00:17:09,499
You have filed for
a divorce in the court.

201
00:17:09,563 --> 00:17:14,209
And you.. how do you girls
come up with such dangerous ideas?

202
00:17:16,403 --> 00:17:17,280
I am sorry.

203
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:22,719
He insulted me in front of friends,
in my own house

204
00:17:23,644 --> 00:17:24,783
I lost control.

205
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:30,524
Madam, if you keep losing
control you will soon lose the house.

206
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:37,340
You know, your husband hasn't
filed a complaint against you.

207
00:17:38,158 --> 00:17:41,735
He has testified that this
was an accident. Just an accident.

208
00:17:42,129 --> 00:17:43,200
Do you know what this means?

209
00:17:43,531 --> 00:17:44,533
What does this mean?

210
00:17:45,098 --> 00:17:50,713
That means he will
give you tit for tat.

211
00:17:53,774 --> 00:17:54,515
What do I do now?

212
00:17:56,209 --> 00:17:57,519
Sorry. Sorry. <i>SONY.</i>

213
00:17:57,745 --> 00:17:59,123
It's okay. Come in.

214
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:04,491
Mrs. Gunjan, my friend
Dilar. He's a billionaire

215
00:18:04,718 --> 00:18:07,930
He started his business
became a big shot.

216
00:18:08,021 --> 00:18:10,333
He made a lot of money.
He socializes with affluent people

217
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:14,808
He only socializes with big shots
but we daily have our lunch together.

218
00:18:15,028 --> 00:18:16,737
Please join us for lunch

219
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:19,371
Please join us. - No.

220
00:18:20,033 --> 00:18:20,569
Thanks.

221
00:18:20,968 --> 00:18:24,214
<i>I'll</i> get going
You just handle the case.

222
00:18:24,805 --> 00:18:26,183
It shouldn't take
a turn for the worse.

223
00:18:26,707 --> 00:18:28,552
No, no, no.
No worries No worries No worries.

224
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:29,748
You don't need to worry.

225
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,821
<i>I'll</i> handle him in the court, but..

226
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:35,228
You need to be careful
of him at home. Okay?

227
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:37,592
Take care Especially at night.

228
00:18:38,185 --> 00:18:40,532
Lock the door before sleeping. Okay?

229
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:42,161
Understood?

230
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:46,302
Okay? You can leave now. Bye.

231
00:18:46,827 --> 00:18:47,772
See you

232
00:18:48,228 --> 00:18:48,934
See you

233
00:18:56,336 --> 00:18:57,281
She is beautiful.

234
00:18:58,338 --> 00:19:00,149
She is also dangerous.

235
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:03,721
Cheers.

236
00:19:11,084 --> 00:19:14,535
Very interesting.
- Just like your new client.

237
00:19:15,388 --> 00:19:16,596
Gunjan had a love marriage

238
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:20,406
She was crazily in
love with her husband.

239
00:19:20,561 --> 00:19:21,597
Their hearts beat as one

240
00:19:21,829 --> 00:19:23,868
And now they hate
each other like anything.

241
00:19:23,964 --> 00:19:25,912
Just yesterday she
tried to burn her husband

242
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:27,812
Really? - Yes

243
00:19:28,201 --> 00:19:30,582
But she is very lovely.

244
00:19:30,704 --> 00:19:32,412
Lovely, beautiful.

245
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,181
Anyone can fall in love
with such a beautiful face

246
00:19:37,545 --> 00:19:39,184
But very dangerous

247
00:19:39,547 --> 00:19:40,788
She is very dangerous.

248
00:19:41,048 --> 00:19:42,723
This story seems interesting.

249
00:19:42,816 --> 00:19:45,196
Let's enjoy it over these drinks.

250
00:19:45,586 --> 00:19:47,932
Tell me, where did they meet and how?

251
00:19:48,121 --> 00:19:51,538
They met in such an interesting way
that when they met for the first time.

252
00:19:51,892 --> 00:19:54,306
There was a fight, an argument.

253
00:19:54,595 --> 00:19:57,909
I've told you a million times
I am not having an affair with anyone.

254
00:19:58,198 --> 00:20:00,875
You are defaming
me by spreading rumors.

255
00:20:01,301 --> 00:20:05,344
Your friends are responsible for
all this you hard-of-hearing girl.

256
00:20:05,973 --> 00:20:11,087
Hey, she might be hard-of-hearing
but you are characterless.

257
00:20:11,344 --> 00:20:13,520
Hey, the leader of crazy people

258
00:20:13,714 --> 00:20:15,194
Mind your language.

259
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:16,556
Who are you to give
a character certificate?

260
00:20:16,784 --> 00:20:17,661
Are you 31115997

261
00:20:17,985 --> 00:20:21,128
If I was a judge,
all men like him would be in prison.

262
00:20:21,522 --> 00:20:24,095
We'll decide on the
people like you right away.

263
00:20:24,592 --> 00:20:27,165
A few thrashing and you
will forget your attitude.

264
00:20:27,427 --> 00:20:28,931
I don't raise my hand on woman..

265
00:20:29,162 --> 00:20:31,166
...but I have no such restrictions
for animals like you.

266
00:20:31,364 --> 00:20:35,145
Don't act smart. There aren't many
hospitals in our city for animals

267
00:20:35,736 --> 00:20:37,718
Stop it, brother.
Why are you messing with them?

268
00:20:37,938 --> 00:20:40,181
Her friends are just like her.

269
00:20:40,774 --> 00:20:42,813
They should've given me a rope to
keep her in control as a wedding gift.

270
00:20:55,388 --> 00:20:56,596
You slapped my husband?

271
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:58,292
How dare you!

272
00:20:59,693 --> 00:21:03,405
Natasha, I am supporting you
He deserves it.

273
00:21:04,331 --> 00:21:07,509
I am his wife
I will decide on what he deserves

274
00:21:07,935 --> 00:21:10,509
Shibu, I got instigated

275
00:21:10,938 --> 00:21:15,186
They took advantage of our situation
and made us go against each other.

276
00:21:16,043 --> 00:21:18,788
They are not friends, they are devil.

277
00:21:19,913 --> 00:21:22,191
'What? I am a devil?

278
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:28,165
You were searching Google for new ways
to hit him since the past four days.

279
00:21:28,689 --> 00:21:29,862
And I am a devil.

280
00:21:31,324 --> 00:21:34,069
Both of you should be hanged

281
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:39,775
Don't ever meet me again
even by mistake, otherwise..

282
00:21:41,902 --> 00:21:42,403
Die!

283
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:44,406
Shibu..

284
00:21:50,343 --> 00:21:55,093
The story should end right there
if their first meeting was like that.

285
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:56,557
How did they meet again?

286
00:21:56,784 --> 00:21:58,891
Moreover, how did they become friends?

287
00:21:59,219 --> 00:22:00,859
Like their story
has got you interested..

288
00:22:00,954 --> 00:22:03,801
...I think even God took
interest in their story.

289
00:22:04,091 --> 00:22:06,540
Gunjan needed a room on rent.

290
00:22:06,627 --> 00:22:08,506
She saw an advertisement
in the newspaper..

291
00:22:08,562 --> 00:22:12,708
...that a theater artist
needs a room partner.

292
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,613
The rent will be shared.
Cool. Peaceful.

293
00:22:16,003 --> 00:22:19,112
Gunjan read that and went
there with her bags and baggage

294
00:22:19,206 --> 00:22:22,418
Happy, this cruel world
won't let us be together:

295
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:24,521
I love you a lot.

296
00:22:24,778 --> 00:22:26,782
No matter how much the
world tries to pressurize us..

297
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:30,591
If we won't unite here,
we shall be together up in heaven

298
00:22:31,218 --> 00:22:32,790
I am going. - No.

299
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,491
I am going. - No.

300
00:22:34,688 --> 00:22:35,895
<i>L</i> am going.

301
00:22:35,989 --> 00:22:37,401
No!

302
00:22:42,996 --> 00:22:45,570
I too don't wish to live without you!

303
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,024
Ruchi!

304
00:23:33,146 --> 00:23:34,023
Hi. - Hi.

305
00:23:34,314 --> 00:23:37,389
You didn't call me. I thought
you must've made some arrangement.

306
00:23:37,785 --> 00:23:39,528
I kept someone else yesterday.

307
00:23:40,554 --> 00:23:41,123
Yes

308
00:23:41,955 --> 00:23:43,492
Your number got deleted.

309
00:23:43,924 --> 00:23:46,338
I thought of taking
a chance by meeting you

310
00:23:47,427 --> 00:23:48,498
'What will you do now?

311
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:50,905
I don't know.

312
00:23:53,233 --> 00:23:57,709
I will find away.
- But how? It's not so easy.

313
00:23:57,938 --> 00:23:58,279
Yes, true.

314
00:23:58,371 --> 00:24:01,412
Do one thing, stay with my friend
- Your friend?

315
00:24:01,842 --> 00:24:02,913
He's like a brother to me.

316
00:24:04,645 --> 00:24:05,624
And he is a decent man

317
00:24:05,979 --> 00:24:08,325
He? Decent? -Yes. -Very.

318
00:24:08,916 --> 00:24:10,727
Yes, he has told me everything

319
00:24:11,084 --> 00:24:13,590
Such small things keep
having in big cities

320
00:24:14,187 --> 00:24:16,693
But Ruchi, how can I stay with him?

321
00:24:17,124 --> 00:24:19,971
Try to adjust for a few days.
Meanwhile <i>I'll</i> find away out.

322
00:24:21,929 --> 00:24:23,136
He won't say anything to you.

323
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:24,734
He'll keep sleeping in a corner.

324
00:25:30,564 --> 00:25:31,703
You didn't sleep?

325
00:25:34,168 --> 00:25:35,581
I too didn't sleep the whole night.

326
00:25:37,137 --> 00:25:38,584
You know what my friends say?

327
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,585
That I fall from
the bed at night. And..

328
00:25:43,911 --> 00:25:45,357
Sometimes I ride a cycle.

329
00:25:45,946 --> 00:25:46,925
Sometimes I start walking

330
00:25:47,915 --> 00:25:49,624
Now there should be a limit to lying.

331
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,064
You too didn't sleep

332
00:25:57,424 --> 00:26:02,812
I have heard that animals too can'! sleep
on the first day in their new house.

333
00:26:05,999 --> 00:26:06,569
Smile?

334
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:11,375
Are you scared of me?

335
00:26:14,542 --> 00:26:15,350
I am a very decent man.

336
00:26:16,977 --> 00:26:19,323
I go for a walk every morning.

337
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,622
In fresh air.

338
00:26:24,518 --> 00:26:25,360
'Will you come with me?

339
00:26:27,521 --> 00:26:30,299
Let's go.
It might help with your mood.

340
00:26:33,594 --> 00:26:35,131
It will wake me up as well.

341
00:26:37,631 --> 00:26:38,336
Shall we?

342
00:26:53,346 --> 00:26:54,793
I hope tomorrow you
don't come up and say..

343
00:26:55,348 --> 00:26:56,191
"How did this happen, Ranbir?

344
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:59,064
I am staying with you and
now I am pregnant with your child."

345
00:26:59,587 --> 00:27:02,799
"Either marry me or give me poison."

346
00:27:04,024 --> 00:27:06,769
That is not possible. - Why?

347
00:27:08,629 --> 00:27:11,271
I cannot be so wrong
in knowing a person

348
00:27:11,832 --> 00:27:12,504
'What do you mean?

349
00:27:13,366 --> 00:27:14,904
Either you cannot be like her?

350
00:27:16,203 --> 00:27:17,980
Or I cannot get you to that state?

351
00:27:18,706 --> 00:27:19,742
Shut up, Ranbir.

352
00:27:27,548 --> 00:27:31,363
It is fun to have tea with
a beautiful girl early in the morning

353
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:33,496
What do you mean, it is fun?

354
00:27:33,554 --> 00:27:35,398
I mean I have had tea with my friends.

355
00:27:35,923 --> 00:27:38,930
But I am enjoying
drinking tea with you.

356
00:27:40,695 --> 00:27:43,804
I am wondering how
you survived staying alone

357
00:27:44,397 --> 00:27:46,401
You love to talk

358
00:27:47,835 --> 00:27:49,338
What do you do?

359
00:27:50,571 --> 00:27:53,315
I work in an ad agency. A9-5job.

360
00:27:54,842 --> 00:27:57,792
And I work 5-11.
So we won't meet quite often.

361
00:28:00,214 --> 00:28:05,293
And you can enjoy having tea
here with a beautiful girl on Sundays

362
00:28:08,522 --> 00:28:10,002
Cheers.

363
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:16,545
So they had tea together. They went
for jogging and running in the garden

364
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:20,582
And slowly-slowly
they became good friends.

365
00:28:20,901 --> 00:28:22,974
'Will they keep running
or will they hit the brakes too?

366
00:28:23,103 --> 00:28:24,948
They did. They hit the brakes.

367
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:27,418
Gunjan was working.
She got a promotion.

368
00:28:27,541 --> 00:28:30,684
And she was asked to go
work out of town for a month.

369
00:28:30,944 --> 00:28:33,894
And Gunjan happily accepted it.

370
00:28:35,015 --> 00:28:36,758
Good. Good. Ambitious girl. -Yes.

371
00:28:36,851 --> 00:28:39,356
But what does that have
to do with the two of them?

372
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,993
Dilar, you are not at all romantic

373
00:28:43,123 --> 00:28:45,572
This is your only problem
This is your problem

374
00:28:45,826 --> 00:28:49,505
My brother, love is a strange thing

375
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:53,741
Distance makes the heart grow fonder.

376
00:28:54,167 --> 00:28:58,951
The situation had changed
with Gunjan returned.

377
00:28:59,339 --> 00:29:01,343
Ranbir, Gunjan is here.

378
00:29:02,042 --> 00:29:04,582
Gunjan! - Oh, she is back? -Yes.

379
00:29:04,812 --> 00:29:05,951
Go, run!
<i>- I'll</i> be right back, brother.

380
00:29:11,685 --> 00:29:14,065
You are back You didn't tell me

381
00:29:14,421 --> 00:29:15,766
I would've come to
receive you at the airport.

382
00:29:18,191 --> 00:29:19,934
You lost your keys, right?
You have come to take the keys?

383
00:29:20,761 --> 00:29:21,900
Where is your bag?

384
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,208
I am coming from home.

385
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:31,380
Why does one look so different?

386
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:33,987
I think destruction
is heading towards me.

387
00:29:34,307 --> 00:29:35,412
I am leaving the house

388
00:30:03,437 --> 00:30:04,143
Gunjan.

389
00:30:14,782 --> 00:30:16,160
You didn't pay the rent.

390
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:38,141
There is one way to save money.

391
00:30:40,107 --> 00:30:41,554
Get married to me.

392
00:31:01,595 --> 00:31:04,511
"It's the talk of the town."

393
00:31:04,565 --> 00:31:07,104
"There are pamphlets
being distributed."

394
00:31:07,535 --> 00:31:12,614
"Beautiful,
you made the boys spend more."

395
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,687
"It's the talk of the town."

396
00:31:14,775 --> 00:31:16,153
"There are pamphlets
being distributed."

397
00:31:16,243 --> 00:31:20,127
"Beautiful,
you made the boys spend more."

398
00:31:20,548 --> 00:31:25,730
"Even the mostly dangerous
wanted dacoits return empty-handed."

399
00:31:26,353 --> 00:31:31,502
"The ones mesmerized by your eyes
have stopped going to the fields"

400
00:31:32,192 --> 00:31:37,614
"The ones mesmerized by your eyes
have stopped going to the fields"

401
00:31:37,732 --> 00:31:41,012
"I keep my heart safe"

402
00:31:41,135 --> 00:31:43,378
"I don't look at anyone"

403
00:31:44,004 --> 00:31:46,749
"Have no illusion."

404
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:49,220
"I don't apply kohl."

405
00:31:49,543 --> 00:31:51,148
"I keep my heart safe"

406
00:31:51,244 --> 00:31:52,782
"I don't look at anyone"

407
00:31:52,913 --> 00:31:54,154
"Have no illusion."

408
00:31:54,247 --> 00:31:56,354
"I don't apply kohl."

409
00:31:56,817 --> 00:32:02,501
"If God has blessed me with beauty
then why shouldn't I be proud of it?"

410
00:32:02,723 --> 00:32:08,178
"if boys are fighting for me,
then tell me what my fault is?"

411
00:32:08,428 --> 00:32:14,613
"if boys are fighting for me,
then tell me what my fault is?"

412
00:32:26,446 --> 00:32:31,526
"They walk always armed with sticks."

413
00:32:32,152 --> 00:32:37,368
"They keep fighting every day."

414
00:32:38,158 --> 00:32:41,074
"They walk always armed with sticks."

415
00:32:41,161 --> 00:32:45,170
"They keep fighting every day."

416
00:32:45,566 --> 00:32:50,543
"Anyone who tried to dance
anywhere close by was taken care of."

417
00:32:51,038 --> 00:32:56,356
"The ones mesmerized by your eyes
have stopped going to the fields"

418
00:32:56,644 --> 00:33:02,429
"if boys are fighting for me,
then tell me what my fault is?"

419
00:33:03,017 --> 00:33:08,335
"The ones mesmerized by your eyes
have stopped going to the fields"

420
00:33:08,421 --> 00:33:14,902
"if boys are fighting for me,
then tell me what my fault is?"

421
00:33:18,833 --> 00:33:20,279
Are you alright?

422
00:33:21,368 --> 00:33:21,574
Yes?

423
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:25,717
Congratulations
You should offer me sweets.

424
00:33:25,806 --> 00:33:27,549
You are pregnant.

425
00:33:29,109 --> 00:33:29,918
<i>What happened'?</i>

426
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:33,793
I deserve some sweets
I won't let you go otherwise.

427
00:33:33,914 --> 00:33:36,898
I will do your delivery.

428
00:33:36,984 --> 00:33:38,863
'With my own hands.

429
00:33:39,152 --> 00:33:40,895
But we just got married yesterday.

430
00:33:42,089 --> 00:33:43,068
Am I that strong?

431
00:33:44,224 --> 00:33:44,965
Shut up

432
00:33:45,893 --> 00:33:47,066
That is not possible

433
00:33:47,562 --> 00:33:48,701
It's not physically possible.

434
00:33:48,996 --> 00:33:50,408
Oh no.

435
00:33:52,132 --> 00:33:54,307
These girls and boys, I tell you.

436
00:33:54,802 --> 00:33:56,077
They have no patience

437
00:33:56,637 --> 00:33:59,415
You should've at least
waited till you got married.

438
00:33:59,773 --> 00:34:01,618
What was the hurry?

439
00:34:04,211 --> 00:34:09,325
During my time,
we used to not even look for a week.

440
00:34:10,984 --> 00:34:12,396
I mean at each other.

441
00:34:14,387 --> 00:34:15,366
What did you think?

442
00:34:17,958 --> 00:34:20,099
Sorry, doctor.
Ma'am, you got the wrong report.

443
00:34:20,193 --> 00:34:21,503
This is her report.

444
00:34:21,729 --> 00:34:24,337
I got confused because both
the patients names were same

445
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:28,081
Stupid. - Sorry, ma'am.

446
00:34:31,371 --> 00:34:33,684
It happened accidentally.

447
00:34:35,042 --> 00:34:38,823
Don't worry.
You just have an upset stomach.

448
00:34:39,747 --> 00:34:42,320
It's okay. <i>I'll</i> prescribe
some medicines Have them

449
00:34:42,783 --> 00:34:49,001
And come to me for delivery. Okay?

450
00:34:49,824 --> 00:34:52,204
I too should get a
chance to serve you. Right?

451
00:34:54,161 --> 00:35:00,379
Now.. you are married,
so think about it.

452
00:35:01,536 --> 00:35:02,538
Naturally?

453
00:35:04,171 --> 00:35:10,128
Doctors and lawyers know everything
about their patients and clients.

454
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:13,126
When she came to my office
for the very first time, I told her:

455
00:35:13,213 --> 00:35:16,721
"Madam, sit down please.
And tell me your story in detail."

456
00:35:17,518 --> 00:35:20,695
And she just started
as soon as I said that.

457
00:35:20,788 --> 00:35:22,531
And she kept narrating
at a breakneck speed.

458
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:24,594
I got scared she might forget to breathe..

459
00:35:24,725 --> 00:35:27,333
...while narrating her story at such a speed.

460
00:35:27,427 --> 00:35:30,742
I said: "madam, slow down.
Slow down Breathe a little."

461
00:35:30,831 --> 00:35:32,506
"You have been talking
non-stop since half an hour."

462
00:35:32,567 --> 00:35:33,808
My time is up now.

463
00:35:33,934 --> 00:35:38,216
Now if you speak,
you will be charged for per minute

464
00:35:38,573 --> 00:35:41,887
I thought she will run away
after hearing that, but she didn't.

465
00:35:42,176 --> 00:35:43,281
She started once again.

466
00:35:44,311 --> 00:35:46,384
At full speed. At breakneck speed.

467
00:35:46,647 --> 00:35:50,325
And I heard the whole story
and made some money as well.

468
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:53,263
Okay. How much did
you bill her that day?

469
00:35:53,888 --> 00:35:57,533
I think that was 15000 only.

470
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:00,666
Hey, but they were living on rent.

471
00:36:01,095 --> 00:36:03,373
Then how did they
get such a big bungalow?

472
00:36:03,598 --> 00:36:10,614
My dear friend, there is
a very sad good news behind that.

473
00:36:21,248 --> 00:36:23,697
Your grandma is looking so good.

474
00:36:28,388 --> 00:36:30,769
She passed away at such a young age.

475
00:36:33,227 --> 00:36:34,731
She was only 91 years only.

476
00:36:41,702 --> 00:36:43,911
She was missing you in her dead bed.

477
00:36:44,905 --> 00:36:47,787
She said,
"Gunji, my child, where are you?"

478
00:36:53,046 --> 00:36:53,957
She loved you a lot.

479
00:36:54,548 --> 00:36:57,087
She left a property
worth <i>5</i> crores for you.

480
00:36:57,885 --> 00:36:59,696
She said to give it to Gunjan.

481
00:37:00,287 --> 00:37:01,666
Your grandma was very nice.

482
00:37:11,566 --> 00:37:13,707
Grandma!

483
00:37:13,801 --> 00:37:17,115
Grandma!
Why did you leave me? Grandma!

484
00:37:17,404 --> 00:37:19,580
You left me alone, grandma!

485
00:37:20,207 --> 00:37:21,882
This wasn't an age to die

486
00:37:22,142 --> 00:37:24,716
Oh grandma.

487
00:37:24,812 --> 00:37:25,757
Grandma.

488
00:37:26,346 --> 00:37:29,559
No, my child
Don't cry. Brace yourself.

489
00:37:31,218 --> 00:37:33,861
We don't want the money, grandma

490
00:37:33,954 --> 00:37:35,663
'What will we do with it?

491
00:37:36,356 --> 00:37:38,304
Just come back, grandma

492
00:37:38,392 --> 00:37:39,532
God, you are great.

493
00:37:39,894 --> 00:37:43,505
Grandma was right. She said
Gunjan doesn't need this money.

494
00:37:43,998 --> 00:37:47,575
Hence she transferred a
lot of the property to a trust.

495
00:37:50,337 --> 00:37:52,182
Grandma!

496
00:37:54,007 --> 00:37:55,545
How much?

497
00:37:56,577 --> 00:37:58,285
95% was transferred to the trust.

498
00:37:58,746 --> 00:38:01,319
And she has left
25 lakhs rupees for you.

499
00:38:05,352 --> 00:38:07,596
Grandma!

500
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,511
I would've filed a case against
the old woman had she been alive.

501
00:38:28,375 --> 00:38:29,549
We are not beggars.

502
00:38:31,211 --> 00:38:32,452
We too have some reputation.

503
00:38:37,518 --> 00:38:41,264
We will take whatever
she throws towards us?

504
00:38:41,889 --> 00:38:43,028
No ways.

505
00:38:55,536 --> 00:39:01,253
What if we talk to the
lawyer and change the will?

506
00:39:02,776 --> 00:39:06,454
'Will God punish us?

507
00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:10,955
Why don't you say something?

508
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,362
Hey!

509
00:39:29,903 --> 00:39:32,078
Money is a very dangerous thing.

510
00:39:32,172 --> 00:39:33,744
You get into trouble if you have it.

511
00:39:34,008 --> 00:39:35,853
You get into trouble
if you don'! have it.

512
00:39:35,943 --> 00:39:39,793
When God is being generous,
one feels on the top of the world.

513
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:41,791
Then no trouble can touch you.

514
00:39:42,016 --> 00:39:46,025
What happened was,
one dead woman gave them money..

515
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,361
And then also an alive one..

516
00:40:18,553 --> 00:40:19,658
Whose house is this?

517
00:40:22,657 --> 00:40:23,260
Ours.

518
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,231
'What do you mean?

519
00:40:29,162 --> 00:40:30,233
It belongs to my boss.

520
00:40:31,331 --> 00:40:32,835
It has not been used from many years

521
00:40:33,501 --> 00:40:38,454
You know, Manjeet madam also
started her life on a rented house.

522
00:40:39,373 --> 00:40:41,549
She knows the value
of having ones own house

523
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:49,791
That's why she wanted to tell this
house to someone who really wants it.

524
00:40:50,918 --> 00:40:52,627
Even if she gets paid
a little less for it.

525
00:40:54,388 --> 00:40:57,669
I think we are destined
to have this house.

526
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,972
But how much is this house worth?

527
00:41:01,529 --> 00:41:02,975
We will pay 25 lakh rupees now.

528
00:41:03,931 --> 00:41:04,933
And the rest in installments.

529
00:41:06,967 --> 00:41:07,673
But how?

530
00:41:10,771 --> 00:41:14,051
We will manage I am confident.

531
00:41:22,215 --> 00:41:28,832
"My love, come to me
Come to me. Come to me."

532
00:41:45,873 --> 00:41:48,516
"Say it with your eyes."

533
00:41:48,776 --> 00:41:51,258
"Whatever your heart hides"

534
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:54,127
"Whatever your heart hides"

535
00:41:54,481 --> 00:41:57,328
"Say it with your eyes."

536
00:41:57,885 --> 00:42:00,767
"Today, I don't know how.."

537
00:42:00,888 --> 00:42:03,531
"Today, I don't know how.."

538
00:42:03,857 --> 00:42:05,736
"Today, I don't know how.."

539
00:42:05,793 --> 00:42:09,574
"Today, I don't know
how I expressed it."

540
00:42:09,697 --> 00:42:12,305
"I am.. I

541
00:42:12,533 --> 00:42:15,448
"I am in love with you"

542
00:42:15,536 --> 00:42:18,109
"I am.. I

543
00:42:18,405 --> 00:42:21,252
"I am in love with you"

544
00:42:21,341 --> 00:42:23,790
"I am.. I

545
00:42:24,011 --> 00:42:26,323
"Say it with your eyes."

546
00:42:26,614 --> 00:42:29,119
"Whatever your heart hides"

547
00:42:29,684 --> 00:42:32,132
"Whatever your heart hides"

548
00:42:32,452 --> 00:42:35,299
"Say it with your eyes."

549
00:42:47,768 --> 00:42:53,451
"Now I keep dreaming about you"

550
00:42:53,541 --> 00:42:58,928
"I have severed all the
ties from this crazy world."

551
00:43:05,252 --> 00:43:10,936
"Now I keep dreaming about you"

552
00:43:11,191 --> 00:43:16,670
"I have severed all the
ties from this crazy world."

553
00:43:16,964 --> 00:43:22,750
"I have severed all the
ties from this crazy world."

554
00:43:22,903 --> 00:43:28,449
"Now all my paths lead to you"

555
00:43:28,676 --> 00:43:34,461
"I don't know why I feel so restless."

556
00:43:34,549 --> 00:43:37,054
"I am.. I

557
00:43:37,384 --> 00:43:40,300
"I am in love with you"

558
00:43:40,387 --> 00:43:43,064
"I am.. I

559
00:43:43,357 --> 00:43:46,068
"I am in love with you"

560
00:43:46,293 --> 00:43:48,674
"I am.. I

561
00:43:48,796 --> 00:43:51,074
"Say it with your eyes."

562
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:53,979
"Whatever your heart hides"

563
00:43:54,502 --> 00:43:56,882
"Whatever your heart hides"

564
00:43:57,304 --> 00:43:59,913
"Say it with your eyes."

565
00:44:11,885 --> 00:44:19,641
Dilar, I'm very happy when two people
in love get together and settle down

566
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:21,101
I am very happy'-

567
00:44:21,361 --> 00:44:23,036
Happy and you?

568
00:44:23,297 --> 00:44:25,108
That too when someone settles down?

569
00:44:25,365 --> 00:44:27,040
That's hard to digest.

570
00:44:27,134 --> 00:44:28,945
Forget it. Continue with the story.

571
00:44:29,069 --> 00:44:33,078
It's said that when God is generous
he's very generous

572
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:37,760
Ranbir, who was a theater artist,
got a job.

573
00:44:37,812 --> 00:44:39,315
In a very big company"Y-

574
00:44:39,547 --> 00:44:41,961
And Gunjan took care of the house.

575
00:44:42,082 --> 00:44:43,961
She started decorating the house

576
00:44:44,084 --> 00:44:45,155
She worked hard

577
00:44:45,285 --> 00:44:48,326
They both worked so hard
and repaid all the debts.

578
00:44:48,455 --> 00:44:51,496
Then the called an old acquaintance

579
00:44:51,592 --> 00:44:54,940
They changed the
interior of their house

580
00:44:55,062 --> 00:44:57,066
They got the interior designed.

581
00:44:57,164 --> 00:44:58,473
Such a beautiful home.

582
00:44:58,799 --> 00:45:01,908
Once a house was
now looking like a home.

583
00:45:02,002 --> 00:45:06,786
Once the house was ready,
they had to give a party, right?

584
00:45:07,875 --> 00:45:10,255
Love me, love me not.

585
00:45:10,945 --> 00:45:13,792
Love me, love me not.

586
00:45:14,615 --> 00:45:16,688
Saw? You once again lost.

587
00:45:17,184 --> 00:45:18,529
This is what you always do.

588
00:45:19,353 --> 00:45:23,499
Come on now, you need to
praise me a little because you lost.

589
00:45:23,891 --> 00:45:24,768
Just a little?

590
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:27,774
I have praised you all my life.

591
00:45:27,995 --> 00:45:29,134
You are my doll.

592
00:45:29,496 --> 00:45:31,136
You are the most beautiful
woman in the world for me.

593
00:45:31,532 --> 00:45:32,978
There is no one better
than you in this world.

594
00:45:33,267 --> 00:45:36,548
No one can give me the love and
happiness you have given me. - Here.

595
00:45:37,705 --> 00:45:38,980
Are you happy? - Huh?

596
00:45:39,106 --> 00:45:40,142
Or should I lie some more?

597
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:43,783
Cheers - Cheers

598
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:49,292
Love me, love me not.

599
00:45:50,117 --> 00:45:52,862
Love me, love me not.

600
00:45:56,891 --> 00:45:57,870
You lost.

601
00:45:58,793 --> 00:45:59,738
What will you do?

602
00:46:00,894 --> 00:46:03,639
Come on, sing a song for me

603
00:46:14,809 --> 00:46:17,986
"I will make you sleepless."

604
00:46:18,312 --> 00:46:21,489
"I will make you restless"

605
00:46:21,782 --> 00:46:28,103
"I will steal you away from
the world and make you mine."

606
00:46:28,388 --> 00:46:34,072
<i>"I'll</i> dwell in your heart in such
a way that I can never get out of it."

607
00:46:34,562 --> 00:46:37,637
"Once you are colored
in the hues of my..

608
00:46:37,765 --> 00:46:41,181
...love, all others
colours will look dull."

609
00:46:41,301 --> 00:46:44,444
"Once you are colored
in the hues of my..

610
00:46:44,539 --> 00:46:48,285
...love, all others
colours will look dull."

611
00:47:03,691 --> 00:47:04,727
Where did you get this piece from?

612
00:47:08,095 --> 00:47:08,904
London.

613
00:47:10,665 --> 00:47:12,578
Okay. It's very beautiful.

614
00:47:20,874 --> 00:47:26,488
"I heard she took a Lancer,
but refusing to eat once."

615
00:47:32,186 --> 00:47:35,329
"I had to beg to get a scooter."

616
00:47:35,455 --> 00:47:38,462
"I had to plead to my mother."

617
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:43,912
"I heard she took a Lancer,
but refusing to eat once."

618
00:47:43,998 --> 00:47:48,382
"God, why is there such
a big difference between us?"

619
00:47:50,104 --> 00:47:52,917
"She has fun on her father's money."

620
00:47:53,006 --> 00:47:55,922
"My father works on the field,
how can he get me a car?"

621
00:47:56,010 --> 00:47:58,755
"She has fun on her father's money."

622
00:47:58,813 --> 00:48:00,293
"My father works.."

623
00:48:02,349 --> 00:48:04,024
'What? 'What happened?

624
00:48:04,284 --> 00:48:05,560
When did you go to London?

625
00:48:08,155 --> 00:48:10,570
That's allowed.
What difference does it make?

626
00:48:10,691 --> 00:48:11,636
It makes a difference to me

627
00:48:11,892 --> 00:48:14,535
It makes a difference to
me when you lie to my boss's wife

628
00:48:14,895 --> 00:48:17,070
I have told you a million
times not to lie like that.

629
00:48:17,264 --> 00:48:18,643
Then? 'What should have I said?

630
00:48:19,133 --> 00:48:20,272
That I got it from a flee market?

631
00:48:20,668 --> 00:48:22,513
You embarrassed me
in front of everyone.

632
00:48:22,903 --> 00:48:23,678
Embarrassed?

633
00:48:24,371 --> 00:48:27,515
That Mrs. Agarwal.. she lies a lot.

634
00:48:27,708 --> 00:48:30,783
'What about her?
- She is rich She can lie.

635
00:48:31,111 --> 00:48:32,455
We cannot match up with them.

636
00:48:34,515 --> 00:48:37,863
No one will say anything
about me and my house.

637
00:48:40,954 --> 00:48:45,429
Gunjan was used hearing
praises about her house.

638
00:48:45,759 --> 00:48:47,467
You know ladies' habit.

639
00:48:48,929 --> 00:48:50,102
She is naive.

640
00:48:50,197 --> 00:48:53,671
Husband and wife keep
fighting over small things

641
00:48:53,767 --> 00:48:55,475
But how did they end
up filing for divorce?

642
00:48:55,570 --> 00:48:59,282
You'll be surprised to know
that out of all the divorce cases.

643
00:48:59,507 --> 00:49:02,980
...that I have fought
or heard of so far..

644
00:49:03,578 --> 00:49:10,503
...none of them had
a big reason for divorce.

645
00:49:10,551 --> 00:49:14,526
Small issues,
small misunderstandings.

646
00:49:14,789 --> 00:49:19,504
Many at times arguments and
tiffs begin but they don't end.

647
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,901
It ends in the court.

648
00:49:22,129 --> 00:49:26,047
And one day similarly Ranbir
and Gunjan fell into this trap.

649
00:49:29,604 --> 00:49:30,378
Gunjan.

650
00:49:31,806 --> 00:49:32,683
Gunjan!

651
00:49:34,274 --> 00:49:34,946
Gunjan!

652
00:49:37,612 --> 00:49:39,651
Yes? 'What happened?

653
00:49:40,014 --> 00:49:41,085
My boss just called.

654
00:49:41,481 --> 00:49:42,358
You spoke to him?

655
00:49:44,251 --> 00:49:44,753
Yes

656
00:49:45,352 --> 00:49:46,354
You sent him pickle?

657
00:49:47,454 --> 00:49:48,058
Yes

658
00:49:48,388 --> 00:49:48,867
Yes?

659
00:49:49,524 --> 00:49:52,063
You are starting a pickles'
business and you didn't even tell me?

660
00:49:52,292 --> 00:49:53,431
What kind of a stupidity is this?

661
00:49:54,595 --> 00:49:56,269
I was going to tell you

662
00:49:56,764 --> 00:49:59,337
I've been telling you since
morning that I need to speak to you.

663
00:49:59,466 --> 00:50:00,776
You say that everyday.

664
00:50:01,769 --> 00:50:03,374
Can I say something now?
- Yes, go ahead.

665
00:50:07,675 --> 00:50:08,518
Speak up.

666
00:50:10,410 --> 00:50:14,453
Two days ago, your boss's
wife had come home with her friends.

667
00:50:15,015 --> 00:50:16,963
We had a small kitty party.

668
00:50:18,185 --> 00:50:20,133
I fed them my homemade pickle.

669
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:22,559
They went mad.

670
00:50:23,557 --> 00:50:29,137
Then all of them forced
me to start a business.

671
00:50:30,598 --> 00:50:32,078
We should start a factory.

672
00:50:33,967 --> 00:50:35,345
You want to sell pickles?

673
00:50:36,804 --> 00:50:37,373
Yes

674
00:50:38,405 --> 00:50:39,146
<i>What happened'?</i>

675
00:50:39,907 --> 00:50:40,943
'What's wrong with that?

676
00:50:43,944 --> 00:50:45,584
But how did my boss find out about it?

677
00:50:46,914 --> 00:50:51,094
His wife asked me to give
her some pickle in a bottle

678
00:50:52,252 --> 00:50:53,733
She wanted her husband to taste it.

679
00:50:54,154 --> 00:50:58,334
He will become a partner
in our business if he likes it.

680
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:00,164
What? My boss?

681
00:51:00,528 --> 00:51:03,101
Who has property worth millions,
he has many business..

682
00:51:03,497 --> 00:51:05,308
He will start a pickles' factory?

683
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:06,339
Have you lost your mind?

684
00:51:07,067 --> 00:51:09,106
But Mrs. Agarwal told me.

685
00:51:09,336 --> 00:51:10,372
They are making a fool out of you..

686
00:51:10,771 --> 00:51:11,580
They are making fun of you..

687
00:51:11,706 --> 00:51:12,742
They are pulling your leg.

688
00:51:12,807 --> 00:51:14,880
This is the way these
rich people have fun.

689
00:51:25,352 --> 00:51:26,833
You are jealous of me?

690
00:51:29,289 --> 00:51:30,462
Have you lost your mind?

691
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:36,136
You cannot tolerate the fact
that I can start my own company.

692
00:51:37,131 --> 00:51:40,240
You won't be able to tolerate
my banners on the road.

693
00:51:40,701 --> 00:51:41,840
Gunjan Pickles

694
00:51:42,770 --> 00:51:44,513
Your name will be on the banners?

695
00:51:45,506 --> 00:51:45,984
Yes

696
00:51:47,207 --> 00:51:49,246
This pickle will
go to your office too.

697
00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:51,447
Everyone in the staff will eat it.

698
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:55,792
And.. why just my name,
<i>I'll</i> put my photo on it too.

699
00:52:00,287 --> 00:52:01,632
Gunjan Pickles

700
00:52:25,813 --> 00:52:26,758
AW-

701
00:52:27,548 --> 00:52:30,087
I have told you keep the house clean.

702
00:52:31,118 --> 00:52:32,427
You know how hard we
have worked to make it.

703
00:52:33,954 --> 00:52:36,459
I told you that you won't
do this business, so you won't do it.

704
00:52:36,757 --> 00:52:41,437
I am saying it in a very straightforward
way that you won't do this business.

705
00:52:41,929 --> 00:52:42,430
Okay?

706
00:52:43,597 --> 00:52:44,166
Yes

707
00:52:50,671 --> 00:52:51,878
I will do it.

708
00:52:53,774 --> 00:52:55,118
You won't do it.

709
00:52:58,913 --> 00:53:00,120
I will move forward.

710
00:53:01,348 --> 00:53:03,455
I will move forward at any cost.

711
00:53:09,189 --> 00:53:12,139
If you'll move forward then
I will throw you out of the house.

712
00:53:13,527 --> 00:53:16,670
<i>I'll</i> do it. -You'll still do it?

713
00:53:17,565 --> 00:53:19,273
I will throw you out of my life

714
00:53:23,203 --> 00:53:24,684
I will still do it.

715
00:53:28,142 --> 00:53:30,989
You want a divorce, right? A divorce?

716
00:53:31,812 --> 00:53:32,883
<i>I'll</i> file for one tomorrow itself.

717
00:53:43,190 --> 00:53:44,135
I will do it.

718
00:53:45,292 --> 00:53:47,274
I will do it.
I will do it. I will do it.

719
00:53:49,162 --> 00:53:52,339
'How dare he! How dare he say it!'

720
00:53:52,667 --> 00:53:55,549
'I left my world
behind to be with him'

721
00:53:55,936 --> 00:53:56,938
'And this is how he treats me?'

722
00:53:57,371 --> 00:54:00,048
'I would've tolerated if
he would've said anything else.'

723
00:54:00,473 --> 00:54:01,452
'But divorce?'

724
00:54:01,876 --> 00:54:05,760
"What did he think, he can
scare me with such a big threat?'

725
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:08,563
'Whatever he is today,
is because of our hard work.'

726
00:54:08,883 --> 00:54:12,129
'If he can leave me
then I too can leave him'

727
00:54:12,587 --> 00:54:15,764
'I will divorce him
before he divorces me.'

728
00:54:16,256 --> 00:54:18,067
<i>'I'll</i> have to teach him a lesson.'

729
00:54:18,993 --> 00:54:20,941
'What? They are getting
divorced because of pickles?

730
00:54:21,361 --> 00:54:23,571
They are making a mountain out of..
- Pickles.

731
00:54:24,999 --> 00:54:28,576
Dear Dilar, women can tolerate a lot.

732
00:54:28,869 --> 00:54:32,878
...but at times they cannot
tolerate small things.

733
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:37,490
So you should think twice
before speaking to a woman.

734
00:54:37,578 --> 00:54:43,329
Words once spoken
can never be taken back.

735
00:54:43,584 --> 00:54:46,066
And these words landed them in court.

736
00:54:46,286 --> 00:54:48,234
I too will go to court.

737
00:54:48,321 --> 00:54:49,961
I've heard enough of your commentary.

738
00:54:50,090 --> 00:54:51,867
Now I shall watch the live telecast.

739
00:54:51,959 --> 00:54:53,770
Sure Sure. Whenever you want.

740
00:54:53,894 --> 00:54:55,534
It's your own court.

741
00:54:56,363 --> 00:54:58,072
Let's go. - Sit down.

742
00:54:58,298 --> 00:55:00,075
Now tell me what will happen next.

743
00:55:01,669 --> 00:55:03,308
You are enjoying this.

744
00:55:03,771 --> 00:55:05,650
What will happen next? Boom!

745
00:55:06,273 --> 00:55:07,446
A blast.

746
00:55:07,808 --> 00:55:11,258
You remember the incident
involving an iron?

747
00:55:11,779 --> 00:55:15,993
The one she used on him?
It is still hot.

748
00:55:16,116 --> 00:55:17,357
The wound is fresh

749
00:55:17,518 --> 00:55:20,126
Ranbir hasn't filed
a complaint with the police.

750
00:55:20,254 --> 00:55:22,737
It means he will seek
revenge in his own way.

751
00:55:22,923 --> 00:55:26,430
He will get discharged
from the hospital today.

752
00:55:26,527 --> 00:55:28,736
He will go straight home.

753
00:55:29,597 --> 00:55:34,243
Tonight will be a
night of catastrophe.

754
00:58:00,714 --> 00:58:02,855
Look, this is the court. - Okay.

755
00:58:02,950 --> 00:58:04,556
You said you wanted to see the court.

756
00:58:04,852 --> 00:58:07,357
The parking is over here.
- Okay, this whole place is the court?

757
00:58:08,188 --> 00:58:09,794
Wait here, <i>I'll</i> be right back. - Okay.

758
00:58:12,226 --> 00:58:14,105
Hello, Mr. Bhagwan - Hi.

759
00:58:14,228 --> 00:58:15,207
I'm on time today.

760
00:58:15,663 --> 00:58:17,838
You are on time but who
have you brought with you?

761
00:58:18,398 --> 00:58:19,469
Who? She? -Yes.

762
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:21,582
She is my secretary. From my office.

763
00:58:21,669 --> 00:58:23,377
Is she just your secretary
or someone special?

764
00:58:24,104 --> 00:58:25,413
No, just my secretary.

765
00:58:26,541 --> 00:58:28,078
Watch out, don't mess up

766
00:58:28,876 --> 00:58:30,015
No, brother. You are my lawyer.

767
00:58:30,110 --> 00:58:31,055
I won't hide anything from you.

768
00:58:31,846 --> 00:58:33,850
I've heard that one shouldn't hide
anything from ones doctor or lawyer.

769
00:58:33,948 --> 00:58:35,428
Very good. - She is my friend

770
00:58:35,516 --> 00:58:36,689
Hi. - She wanted to see the court.

771
00:58:37,050 --> 00:58:38,690
It's okay, <i>I'll</i> put her under 26.

772
00:58:38,853 --> 00:58:39,422
'What do you mean?

773
00:58:40,187 --> 00:58:42,032
I am just kidding.

774
00:58:56,036 --> 00:58:57,915
Hello, sir. -Hello.

775
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:02,717
Congrats
Ours will be the first case today.

776
00:59:03,544 --> 00:59:06,026
Very good. I am very happy.

777
00:59:10,117 --> 00:59:14,001
You are happy, but I am sad.
I am very upset.

778
00:59:14,488 --> 00:59:19,442
Mrs Gunjan, according to the case
I have filed, you have been tortured

779
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:21,671
Your husband troubles you.

780
00:59:22,029 --> 00:59:24,068
Look at the way you have dressed.

781
00:59:24,298 --> 00:59:25,209
You have dressed up like a heroine.

782
00:59:26,501 --> 00:59:31,045
But Mr. Ishwar, my heart
and my mind has been tortured.

783
00:59:31,505 --> 00:59:33,417
What does my dress have to do with it?

784
00:59:33,741 --> 00:59:36,987
Madam keep your
heart and mind at home

785
00:59:37,077 --> 00:59:40,186
You shouldn't bring
it with you in the court.

786
00:59:40,447 --> 00:59:43,523
If you want to win the
case then learn to do drama

787
00:59:43,651 --> 00:59:44,562
Do a little drama

788
00:59:44,885 --> 00:59:47,390
You want a divorce
You don't want to get married.

789
00:59:47,622 --> 00:59:48,464
Understood?

790
00:59:49,089 --> 00:59:50,968
Okay, go inside and wait.
<i>I'll</i> just come

791
00:59:51,458 --> 00:59:53,566
I am coming, just coming. - Okay.

792
00:59:56,463 --> 00:59:57,842
What will happen?

793
00:59:58,498 --> 00:59:59,706
'What will happen in this case?

794
01:00:31,198 --> 01:00:31,677
Speak up.

795
01:00:35,435 --> 01:00:37,178
Say it. Go on.

796
01:00:37,538 --> 01:00:42,048
Milord, <i>I'll</i> present you
with my client Mr. Ranbir's case.

797
01:00:42,276 --> 01:00:44,189
I shall explain everything
mentioned in it.

798
01:00:44,411 --> 01:00:47,293
I have given all the
information in detail.

799
01:00:48,048 --> 01:00:48,857
Me too, sir.

800
01:00:49,149 --> 01:00:51,996
My client Mrs
Gunjan Kaur is innocent, sir.

801
01:00:52,086 --> 01:00:54,626
I want to put forth
the details before you

802
01:00:54,822 --> 01:00:57,430
So allow me to speak first.

803
01:00:57,692 --> 01:01:00,368
It's my turn to speak, sir.
He is unnecessary interfering

804
01:01:00,460 --> 01:01:02,841
Interfering? Look at his language.

805
01:01:03,063 --> 01:01:05,102
I am a respectable advocate.

806
01:01:05,232 --> 01:01:07,407
I too am an advocate I am not a peon.

807
01:01:07,502 --> 01:01:08,412
You should mind your manners.

808
01:01:08,503 --> 01:01:10,177
Our senior is with us.
The judge is present here.

809
01:01:10,270 --> 01:01:11,910
Milord, you decide -Yes, sir.

810
01:01:12,039 --> 01:01:13,714
Order. Order. Order

811
01:01:15,042 --> 01:01:16,682
I don't need any of you.

812
01:01:17,945 --> 01:01:19,858
I have everything here.
I have read everything.

813
01:01:20,748 --> 01:01:23,698
They yell and ruin the whole day.

814
01:01:23,918 --> 01:01:25,091
Their case is very simple.

815
01:01:25,853 --> 01:01:28,062
Let me talk to them

816
01:01:28,388 --> 01:01:30,427
I don't want to waste anyone's time

817
01:01:30,525 --> 01:01:34,841
Otherwise you will start saying
that I keep postponing the hearing.

818
01:01:35,095 --> 01:01:41,313
Hence, Mr. Bhagwan, Mr. Ishwar,
for God's sake, quietly stand here

819
01:01:41,702 --> 01:01:43,615
Okay? - Yes

820
01:01:44,138 --> 01:01:47,418
Bhagwan, summon your client.

821
01:01:49,209 --> 01:01:49,813
Go.

822
01:01:56,851 --> 01:01:57,887
Ranbir.

823
01:02:03,123 --> 01:02:04,502
What's the problem with the pickle?

824
01:02:05,726 --> 01:02:11,409
'What problem do you have
if your wife wishes to make pickles?

825
01:02:11,999 --> 01:02:13,070
What's your problem?

826
01:02:13,834 --> 01:02:14,836
Sir, I don't like it.

827
01:02:17,872 --> 01:02:22,986
Look sir, I.. I am a judge.
My wife wants to make popadums

828
01:02:23,210 --> 01:02:24,019
She makes them.

829
01:02:24,878 --> 01:02:25,983
I have no problem.

830
01:02:26,346 --> 01:02:27,691
I have no objection.

831
01:02:28,081 --> 01:02:30,792
That's your problem, not mine

832
01:02:31,986 --> 01:02:35,459
Then what is your problem?
Why do you want a divorce?

833
01:02:35,823 --> 01:02:37,064
Just because of the pickle?

834
01:02:37,825 --> 01:02:40,433
Sorry, sir. That's why
I gave you my case's details..

835
01:02:40,528 --> 01:02:41,404
Order. Order.

836
01:02:42,395 --> 01:02:43,374
Stand there quietly.

837
01:02:44,264 --> 01:02:45,300
Don't misguide the court.

838
01:02:46,701 --> 01:02:48,079
'What is the actual problem?

839
01:02:48,302 --> 01:02:51,047
I want to hear this
from the horse's mouth.

840
01:02:53,007 --> 01:02:55,421
So, where is your wife? Call her.

841
01:02:56,076 --> 01:02:57,488
'Where is her file?

842
01:02:58,679 --> 01:03:01,457
Sir.. right hand, sir.

843
01:03:04,118 --> 01:03:06,361
It's not here
- It's on the right, sir.

844
01:03:13,661 --> 01:03:17,271
It's not on the right.
- Sir, on my right. On your left.

845
01:03:17,932 --> 01:03:19,971
Don't you have any common sense?

846
01:03:20,467 --> 01:03:22,471
You should have said on my left.

847
01:03:22,703 --> 01:03:24,810
You also don't misguide the court.

848
01:03:25,072 --> 01:03:26,211
Unnecessarily..

849
01:03:31,211 --> 01:03:32,817
Gunjan Kaur..

850
01:03:50,598 --> 01:03:52,272
You are very beautiful.

851
01:03:56,837 --> 01:03:58,648
It's a compliment.

852
01:04:04,745 --> 01:04:12,000
After looking at you I
realise that Ranbir is right.

853
01:04:15,055 --> 01:04:17,037
You shouldn't make pickles

854
01:04:20,060 --> 01:04:21,803
It's a different case with my wife

855
01:04:33,473 --> 01:04:34,920
What's your problem?

856
01:04:42,016 --> 01:04:42,688
Say it.

857
01:04:44,018 --> 01:04:45,897
Don't be scared.
Say whatever you want to.

858
01:04:48,523 --> 01:04:51,996
Look, we are here to decide

859
01:04:52,459 --> 01:04:54,441
The law is above all.

860
01:04:54,862 --> 01:04:55,603
Speak up.

861
01:04:56,296 --> 01:04:57,207
Speak up, please.

862
01:04:59,433 --> 01:05:03,682
Daulat Singh will get you justice.

863
01:05:04,338 --> 01:05:06,320
You don't need to
feel scared of anyone

864
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:07,112
Speak up.

865
01:05:08,909 --> 01:05:13,225
Look Mrs. Gunjan, how will
we resolve this if you don't speak up?

866
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:14,050
Tell us.

867
01:05:14,682 --> 01:05:15,855
You will have to speak up.

868
01:05:16,149 --> 01:05:18,860
Express your emotions.

869
01:05:19,186 --> 01:05:22,261
Express your thoughts.

870
01:05:22,657 --> 01:05:24,661
Don't feel scared. Say whatever
you want to without hesitation

871
01:05:27,227 --> 01:05:28,867
Please speak up.

872
01:05:30,264 --> 01:05:32,007
Speak. Speak.

873
01:05:32,933 --> 01:05:34,277
Excuse me, sir. -Yes?

874
01:05:34,935 --> 01:05:37,851
My client is a little
scared and petrified.

875
01:05:39,339 --> 01:05:41,378
Like a person slowly
comes out of coma.

876
01:05:41,676 --> 01:05:43,919
Her condition is somewhat like that.

877
01:05:44,211 --> 01:05:47,685
If you scare her like
that then she will..

878
01:05:48,683 --> 01:05:52,395
Sir, I cannot see this delicate
woman stand at the witness stand.

879
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:55,225
So next time should we
have a hearing in a circus?

880
01:05:55,322 --> 01:05:57,201
L.. - Order. Order.

881
01:05:57,658 --> 01:05:59,036
Who is the judge? You or me?

882
01:05:59,527 --> 01:06:02,841
She is scared.
I am trying to handle her.

883
01:06:03,297 --> 01:06:04,903
You are troubling me.

884
01:06:05,032 --> 01:06:07,378
You are misguiding me.
You are misleading me

885
01:06:08,068 --> 01:06:10,517
Now don't say a word more. Got it?

886
01:06:10,638 --> 01:06:13,484
Not a single word.
- Don't even move your hand.

887
01:06:16,276 --> 01:06:18,121
I am the head of this place.
Don't feel scared.

888
01:06:18,412 --> 01:06:20,394
You don't need to fear
anyone as long as I am here.

889
01:06:20,681 --> 01:06:23,995
Who is scaring you? He or that guy?

890
01:06:24,652 --> 01:06:25,460
Tell me

891
01:06:27,522 --> 01:06:32,271
Look Mrs. Gunjan, I won't
let anyone leave until you speak up

892
01:06:32,593 --> 01:06:35,166
Neither will these
advocates leave nor will I.

893
01:06:35,462 --> 01:06:37,809
Everyone in the court
will stay here, today.

894
01:06:37,898 --> 01:06:39,971
You will have to speak up. Speak up.

895
01:06:40,835 --> 01:06:43,010
Speak up. Say something at least.

896
01:06:43,604 --> 01:06:45,847
Tell me what happened with you

897
01:06:48,308 --> 01:06:50,985
Oh come on. Speak up. Say something.

898
01:06:54,481 --> 01:06:56,862
Sir.. - Very good. Yes?

899
01:07:00,454 --> 01:07:01,160
Sir..

900
01:07:03,090 --> 01:07:05,835
Yes? Yes? Continue

901
01:07:09,263 --> 01:07:12,076
Sir.. I have done so much for him.

902
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:14,471
Yes? Yes? Yes?

903
01:07:14,602 --> 01:07:16,709
I changed myself completely.

904
01:07:18,138 --> 01:07:22,090
I don't mind selling pickles

905
01:07:25,479 --> 01:07:27,427
He says people will make fun of me

906
01:07:28,482 --> 01:07:31,022
It's okay. Let them laugh.

907
01:07:32,119 --> 01:07:34,830
It's their problem not mine.

908
01:07:38,025 --> 01:07:40,405
He is a stage artist.

909
01:07:41,028 --> 01:07:42,440
A lot of people laugh.

910
01:07:42,863 --> 01:07:44,503
I have never had any problem.

911
01:07:45,198 --> 01:07:46,473
I have no problem.

912
01:07:47,835 --> 01:07:50,717
He said that I cannot do business.

913
01:07:52,873 --> 01:07:54,684
Why can't I do business?

914
01:07:58,345 --> 01:07:59,416
Why, milord?

915
01:08:00,848 --> 01:08:03,091
A woman of this generation
can do anything

916
01:08:04,384 --> 01:08:06,560
Making pickle is a small task

917
01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:11,270
If he doesn't mend his ways then
<i>I'll</i> make a man out of him as well.

918
01:08:13,528 --> 01:08:17,069
And how can he say
that that house is his?

919
01:08:17,732 --> 01:08:22,185
If I hadn't come into his life he would
still be staying in a rented house

920
01:08:23,538 --> 01:08:26,180
This house was made
the sacrifices made by me

921
01:08:27,642 --> 01:08:30,420
I let go of my old life for him

922
01:08:31,411 --> 01:08:33,655
I left my job for a future with him

923
01:08:35,482 --> 01:08:39,619
We wives surrender our soul, our
hearts. everything, for our family.

924
01:08:39,620 --> 01:08:42,034
We wives surrender our soul, our
hearts. everything, for our family.

925
01:08:43,090 --> 01:08:46,438
They consider our decency
to be our weakness

926
01:08:47,427 --> 01:08:48,874
Why don't they listen to us?

927
01:08:49,630 --> 01:08:52,044
We are servants? What nonsense!

928
01:08:55,235 --> 01:08:59,187
If there are kids in the house
then we have to take care of them

929
01:09:00,074 --> 01:09:02,181
But being all alone at home,
what should I do?

930
01:09:02,877 --> 01:09:04,380
Should I polish his shoes?

931
01:09:05,045 --> 01:09:06,491
We are not doormats.

932
01:09:10,718 --> 01:09:17,802
He said something. It was small thing.
I will divorce you.

933
01:09:18,593 --> 01:09:19,698
He said that and he left.

934
01:09:21,529 --> 01:09:26,677
If saying it was a small thing then
filling a case is also a small thing.

935
01:09:27,868 --> 01:09:31,080
'What did he think?
That I will get scared of the threat?

936
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:33,915
I am not going to get scared.

937
01:09:34,542 --> 01:09:37,719
Now it's do or die.

938
01:09:39,446 --> 01:09:42,920
Either he will leave
the house or l will.

939
01:09:46,186 --> 01:09:48,225
He is a successful man today.

940
01:09:49,023 --> 01:09:53,602
But he doesn't realise
my input behind his success.

941
01:09:54,729 --> 01:09:57,109
You are what you are because of me

942
01:09:58,866 --> 01:10:00,369
I won't leave the house

943
01:10:01,035 --> 01:10:05,112
I will set it on fire but
I won't give the house to him

944
01:10:05,439 --> 01:10:08,082
That house is mine. He can go to hell.

945
01:10:08,509 --> 01:10:10,285
I will destroy everything.

946
01:10:11,245 --> 01:10:12,624
He thinks I am a fool.

947
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:14,224
Am I a fool?

948
01:10:14,715 --> 01:10:16,195
I will ruin you.

949
01:10:17,251 --> 01:10:18,424
Enough. Enough.

950
01:10:19,253 --> 01:10:20,392
Drink a little water.

951
01:10:21,856 --> 01:10:24,099
Calm down. - I cannot keep quiet.

952
01:10:25,727 --> 01:10:27,071
Now I won't keep quiet.

953
01:10:28,295 --> 01:10:32,076
Milord, I will tell you
everything from the beginning

954
01:10:33,100 --> 01:10:36,243
I will give details
about each day and moment.

955
01:10:36,336 --> 01:10:38,375
No, no. I understood.

956
01:10:38,472 --> 01:10:44,521
He met me for the first time on 15th
September 2013 outside this very court.

957
01:10:45,847 --> 01:10:46,986
It was a Monday.

958
01:10:47,247 --> 01:10:49,286
I had taken an off from the office

959
01:10:49,617 --> 01:10:52,156
It must be a Monday.
But you should keep quiet now.

960
01:10:52,253 --> 01:10:55,830
Today no one will leave
this court till I am done talking.

961
01:10:56,090 --> 01:10:57,901
No one will leave - Order. Order.

962
01:10:58,025 --> 01:10:59,437
No one will leave, milord.

963
01:11:00,060 --> 01:11:02,167
First he created a
scene outside the court.

964
01:11:02,730 --> 01:11:05,110
Now he is creating
a scene inside the court.

965
01:11:05,533 --> 01:11:07,309
I will not spare him. - Keep quiet.

966
01:11:07,434 --> 01:11:09,610
I will not spare him
I will not spare him, milord.

967
01:11:09,704 --> 01:11:12,517
I will ruin him. I will not spare him.
I will not spare him

968
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:13,915
Shut up!

969
01:11:14,441 --> 01:11:15,386
Shut up!

970
01:11:15,476 --> 01:11:18,392
Keep quiet.
Quiet. - I will not spare him

971
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:19,625
Keep quiet. Order. Order.

972
01:11:19,714 --> 01:11:20,215
Order.

973
01:11:20,681 --> 01:11:21,284
Quiet.

974
01:11:23,117 --> 01:11:25,065
For God's sake, quiet.

975
01:11:26,453 --> 01:11:27,627
Keep quiet.

976
01:11:35,630 --> 01:11:38,272
You saw that, sir?
This is how she speaks everyday.

977
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:40,904
Tell me how can I
stay in such a household?

978
01:11:41,301 --> 01:11:43,374
Tell me, can you stay at such a place?

979
01:11:44,271 --> 01:11:45,980
We will fix a meeting for Monday.

980
01:11:46,073 --> 01:11:46,848
Tea - okay?

981
01:11:47,441 --> 01:11:49,856
Wait. - It will get cold.

982
01:11:50,111 --> 01:11:52,491
It's okay. - It's not okay.

983
01:11:52,613 --> 01:11:54,652
I will have to reheat it.
- What was I saying?

984
01:11:55,149 --> 01:11:56,458
Then do it.

985
01:11:56,718 --> 01:11:57,697
Hear that! Do it?

986
01:11:57,985 --> 01:12:01,231
Then you will say that it is
dark and strong It has become stale

987
01:12:01,321 --> 01:12:05,000
You don't how to make it.
What has your mother taught you?

988
01:12:05,092 --> 01:12:08,008
I will talk to you later. -
You'll start talking about my family.

989
01:12:09,063 --> 01:12:12,047
You torture your wife
because of your social service.

990
01:12:12,132 --> 01:12:14,205
Shut up. Shut up.

991
01:12:14,535 --> 01:12:15,606
You just can't stop talking.

992
01:12:15,870 --> 01:12:19,082
<i>I'll</i> divorce you
if you say another word.

993
01:12:19,206 --> 01:12:20,881
You won't even have to go to court.

994
01:12:21,008 --> 01:12:22,887
<i>I'll</i> sign it and pass it.

995
01:12:23,010 --> 01:12:26,426
Then you can stand
on the road and sell tea

996
01:12:26,681 --> 01:12:28,457
"Have some tea Have some tea"

997
01:12:37,592 --> 01:12:39,505
Tell me, sir. Am I right?

998
01:12:40,394 --> 01:12:41,807
You are in such a state
just by thinking about it.

999
01:12:42,229 --> 01:12:43,402
I tolerate her every day.

1000
01:12:53,407 --> 01:12:54,649
Saved by the bell.

1001
01:12:55,610 --> 01:12:56,213
The bell.

1002
01:13:03,283 --> 01:13:05,664
She is printing
banners for her pickle

1003
01:13:07,822 --> 01:13:09,200
To add fuel to fire..

1004
01:13:09,290 --> 01:13:11,238
I have instilled fear I her.

1005
01:13:11,325 --> 01:13:15,072
I told her, "listen, don't
say a word when you go to court."

1006
01:13:15,195 --> 01:13:17,610
"I will increase my fees four times"

1007
01:13:17,698 --> 01:13:20,978
Now you will see she will go mum.
She won't say a word.

1008
01:13:25,506 --> 01:13:26,577
A banana - A banana

1009
01:13:26,674 --> 01:13:29,521
It's fun to eat a banana
Right? - Yes

1010
01:13:32,947 --> 01:13:34,427
'What is this, brother?

1011
01:13:34,882 --> 01:13:36,989
A guava Can't you see it's a banana?

1012
01:13:37,117 --> 01:13:39,964
You should be aware
of what you are selling.

1013
01:13:40,454 --> 01:13:41,867
Don't try to fool me with your talks

1014
01:13:41,989 --> 01:13:42,832
Pay UP-

1015
01:13:43,090 --> 01:13:47,065
If thugs keep stealing bananas
from me then I will go pauper.

1016
01:13:47,194 --> 01:13:48,265
Watch your language

1017
01:13:48,830 --> 01:13:50,469
I am being very mindful
of what I am saying.

1018
01:13:50,865 --> 01:13:55,181
I could've even yelled thief, thief
after you took a banana from my cart.

1019
01:13:55,469 --> 01:13:57,918
Thief! He's a thief! Catch him!

1020
01:13:58,039 --> 01:14:01,455
Try calling me a thief!
I will you into a puppet.

1021
01:14:02,109 --> 01:14:03,647
You will spend your
life going to court.

1022
01:14:03,745 --> 01:14:05,282
You don't know who we are. - Yes

1023
01:14:05,546 --> 01:14:07,117
We are lawyers.

1024
01:14:07,515 --> 01:14:10,590
That's why you like to eat
other people's hard earned money.

1025
01:14:13,187 --> 01:14:16,832
Stop your nonsense.
- I will. Just pay up.

1026
01:14:17,224 --> 01:14:19,969
If I want, I can buy your whole can.

1027
01:14:20,595 --> 01:14:23,305
You cannot buy a single banana, and
you say you will buy the whole can.

1028
01:14:25,032 --> 01:14:26,103
Tell me, how much is it worth?

1029
01:14:29,604 --> 01:14:30,583
Rs. 2000.

1030
01:14:31,138 --> 01:14:32,049
Free delivery.

1031
01:14:37,044 --> 01:14:38,422
Is anyone at home fasting?

1032
01:14:40,515 --> 01:14:41,323
Here, hold this.

1033
01:14:42,717 --> 01:14:43,457
Rs 2000?

1034
01:14:43,918 --> 01:14:44,487
Cash.

1035
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:46,391
Just a minute.

1036
01:14:46,487 --> 01:14:48,435
Here you go. And here's my card.

1037
01:14:48,523 --> 01:14:49,867
Send it home Okay?

1038
01:14:52,392 --> 01:14:53,098
Now do you believe me?

1039
01:14:59,033 --> 01:15:00,035
Your sister-in-law.

1040
01:15:01,836 --> 01:15:04,079
Hello? Yes?

1041
01:15:06,073 --> 01:15:06,609
What?

1042
01:15:07,708 --> 01:15:09,017
You want me to bring vegetables?

1043
01:15:10,277 --> 01:15:11,986
I just bought a can full of bananas.

1044
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:14,691
It's just bananas, not poison.

1045
01:15:15,517 --> 01:15:17,498
Listen.
You can make a dish out of it..

1046
01:15:17,618 --> 01:15:19,462
Or make milk shake or
distribute it to our neighbours

1047
01:15:19,654 --> 01:15:21,464
I don't know.
Just take care of the bananas

1048
01:15:21,856 --> 01:15:22,391
Okay.

1049
01:15:24,625 --> 01:15:25,798
'What is it with women?

1050
01:15:26,326 --> 01:15:29,504
They just can't stop talking
I wonder when they will stop talking

1051
01:15:29,631 --> 01:15:30,473
From tomorrow.

1052
01:15:30,698 --> 01:15:33,408
Gunjan will go mum
in the court tomorrow.

1053
01:15:33,668 --> 01:15:35,980
100% silence

1054
01:15:38,873 --> 01:15:41,652
This is what every man wants.
That I should keep quiet.

1055
01:15:43,277 --> 01:15:45,658
Is it really possible
that a woman can stop talking?

1056
01:15:46,847 --> 01:15:48,658
Every impossible thing
in the world is possible..

1057
01:15:48,850 --> 01:15:50,353
But this is impossible

1058
01:15:50,450 --> 01:15:51,795
We tell the truth.

1059
01:15:52,787 --> 01:15:54,324
And truth is always bitten

1060
01:15:54,689 --> 01:15:57,467
And you are used
to having sweet things.

1061
01:15:58,626 --> 01:16:02,042
Truth? That too from a woman? Come on!

1062
01:16:02,462 --> 01:16:05,469
In this world,
behind every truth lies a woman.

1063
01:16:05,700 --> 01:16:06,839
You are mistaken.

1064
01:16:07,267 --> 01:16:09,408
In this world,
behind every fight lies a woman.

1065
01:16:09,837 --> 01:16:11,750
History has borne
witness to this fact.

1066
01:16:12,372 --> 01:16:15,550
How much did you score in history?

1067
01:16:17,044 --> 01:16:18,080
100% percent.

1068
01:16:18,846 --> 01:16:20,349
Hear that.

1069
01:16:20,682 --> 01:16:23,255
Then I am sure someone else
must have given the test for you

1070
01:16:24,885 --> 01:16:27,960
Shit. If only I had
used this seem on you.

1071
01:16:28,288 --> 01:16:29,530
Perhaps I would've passed.

1072
01:16:30,491 --> 01:16:33,407
This isn't a village welfare center,
this is a courtroom.

1073
01:16:33,661 --> 01:16:35,870
You don't get porridges here
You get punished here.

1074
01:16:36,664 --> 01:16:40,376
I too know this is a courtroom and not
your kitchen even happiness gets burned.

1075
01:16:41,803 --> 01:16:43,044
May my enemies' burn to death.

1076
01:16:43,638 --> 01:16:44,674
Why should your enemies burn?

1077
01:16:44,806 --> 01:16:45,216
You should burn.

1078
01:16:45,305 --> 01:16:49,018
You know that..
a dog's tail can never change, right?

1079
01:16:49,109 --> 01:16:50,818
Men are surviving only
because we are clever..

1080
01:16:51,078 --> 01:16:52,251
Otherwise women like you
would've made us go extinct.

1081
01:16:52,379 --> 01:16:54,418
Stop your nonsense. - You stop it

1082
01:16:54,515 --> 01:16:55,961
Shut up. -You shut up

1083
01:16:56,050 --> 01:16:57,531
Shut up - Get lost.

1084
01:16:57,752 --> 01:16:58,925
You get lost.
- Mind your own business.

1085
01:16:59,286 --> 01:17:00,824
Stupid. -You stupid.

1086
01:17:00,955 --> 01:17:02,230
You are stupid. - Idiot.

1087
01:17:02,356 --> 01:17:04,133
Shut up - Let me alone

1088
01:17:04,225 --> 01:17:06,538
You will have to leave me alone.
- You have dishonored me.

1089
01:17:12,767 --> 01:17:15,249
Silence! Silence! Silence!

1090
01:17:19,507 --> 01:17:21,785
Even monkeys don't
fight like you two do.

1091
01:17:23,310 --> 01:17:25,451
This pickle is making
my life miserable

1092
01:17:25,580 --> 01:17:26,958
Where did this pickle come from?

1093
01:17:28,916 --> 01:17:30,522
Sir.. let me tell you.

1094
01:17:32,086 --> 01:17:36,163
A plane" a quarter plate, sir.
Or let's take a full plate

1095
01:17:36,423 --> 01:17:40,273
There will yogurt in it,
some mushroom and spring onions.

1096
01:17:40,628 --> 01:17:44,944
Fish curry,
okra, curry with dumplings and rice.

1097
01:17:45,165 --> 01:17:50,644
Next to that is chapatis, sir.
Right next to the salad is the pickle.

1098
01:17:52,239 --> 01:17:54,448
How is it? - It's tasty, sir.

1099
01:17:55,109 --> 01:17:57,956
Wow. You two have
given me a great example

1100
01:17:58,579 --> 01:18:00,184
Hats off to your imagination.

1101
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:07,599
If I continue to listen to both
of you then <i>I'll</i> soon lose my mind.

1102
01:18:07,855 --> 01:18:10,634
This judge is a fool.

1103
01:18:10,891 --> 01:18:16,848
If I could I would throw him
down from the Burj Khalifa in Dubai.

1104
01:18:18,365 --> 01:18:21,349
Don't worry.
He too will know better in a few days.

1105
01:18:21,769 --> 01:18:22,680
He's a little crazy.

1106
01:18:22,804 --> 01:18:24,808
Wait a minute.

1107
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:28,621
Hey, are you on fire?

1108
01:18:28,676 --> 01:18:30,213
WW don't you fly?

1109
01:18:30,310 --> 01:18:32,292
I will get you arrested.
You don't know who I am

1110
01:18:32,413 --> 01:18:34,623
Advocate Ishwar.

1111
01:18:35,983 --> 01:18:36,461
Yes?

1112
01:18:36,584 --> 01:18:37,620
Why are you getting angry?

1113
01:18:37,952 --> 01:18:40,025
I too am stuck in the
traffic just like you.

1114
01:18:40,354 --> 01:18:41,767
Calm down. Stay calm Just like me.

1115
01:18:45,292 --> 01:18:50,406
I think this judge will
end this case in a few hearings.

1116
01:18:50,497 --> 01:18:51,637
He will give his verdict.

1117
01:18:51,766 --> 01:18:53,645
He will either split
the property into half.

1118
01:18:53,768 --> 01:18:55,681
Or ask them to get back together.

1119
01:18:55,803 --> 01:18:57,682
We are done for.
This is no entertainment for us.

1120
01:18:57,805 --> 01:18:59,616
This isn't entertainment.

1121
01:18:59,874 --> 01:19:01,981
We won't get anything like this.

1122
01:19:02,076 --> 01:19:03,283
The case will end.

1123
01:19:03,410 --> 01:19:06,759
We need to stretch this case,
this issue.

1124
01:19:06,981 --> 01:19:10,626
Use your devilish brain, Bhagwan.

1125
01:19:11,819 --> 01:19:12,855
Okay, done.

1126
01:19:13,487 --> 01:19:14,991
Today Ranbir's secretary
had come with him

1127
01:19:15,089 --> 01:19:16,467
Let's drag her into this

1128
01:19:16,891 --> 01:19:18,736
She wanted to see the court.

1129
01:19:18,826 --> 01:19:22,038
Right. Right.
About what do we do about Gunjan?

1130
01:19:22,163 --> 01:19:24,338
Let's bring Shanty into the picture?

1131
01:19:24,431 --> 01:19:27,541
Who? The interior designer?
- Yes. Her college friend.

1132
01:19:27,868 --> 01:19:29,872
We can make him her old boyfriend.

1133
01:19:30,404 --> 01:19:31,817
Don't you think that will be too much?

1134
01:19:31,906 --> 01:19:35,482
Let us enjoy a little with her,
you naughty boy.

1135
01:19:36,477 --> 01:19:40,486
By the way, you are very naughty.

1136
01:19:42,449 --> 01:19:45,126
We just need to make sure
they don't get together. -Yes

1137
01:19:45,219 --> 01:19:48,636
It shouldn't be that we find out about
it after they fall in love all over again.

1138
01:19:53,861 --> 01:19:56,811
"She has the moon
imprinted on her veil."

1139
01:19:56,897 --> 01:19:59,436
"She has the moon
imprinted on her veil."

1140
01:19:59,567 --> 01:20:02,448
"She has the stars
twinkling on her dress"

1141
01:20:02,570 --> 01:20:05,075
"She has the stars
twinkling on her dress"

1142
01:20:05,205 --> 01:20:08,052
"She has the moon
imprinted on her veil."

1143
01:20:08,175 --> 01:20:10,418
"She has the stars
twinkling on her dress"

1144
01:20:10,511 --> 01:20:13,688
"Her picture got
imprinted on my heart."

1145
01:20:13,815 --> 01:20:15,956
"I need to be with her."

1146
01:20:16,283 --> 01:20:19,233
"She is giving me sleepless nights."

1147
01:20:19,353 --> 01:20:21,734
"Find out which village is she from."

1148
01:20:21,822 --> 01:20:24,863
"She is giving me sleepless nights."

1149
01:20:24,992 --> 01:20:27,270
"Find out which village is she from."

1150
01:20:27,394 --> 01:20:30,538
"She is giving me sleepless nights."

1151
01:20:30,631 --> 01:20:33,808
"Find out which village is she from."

1152
01:20:44,512 --> 01:20:47,553
"Her anklets tease me"

1153
01:20:47,682 --> 01:20:50,723
"Her moves make my intentions stray."

1154
01:20:53,220 --> 01:20:55,863
"Her anklets tease me"

1155
01:20:55,990 --> 01:20:58,370
"Her moves make my intentions stray."

1156
01:20:58,459 --> 01:20:59,336
"Her beauty.."

1157
01:20:59,894 --> 01:21:03,037
"Her beauty has killed me."

1158
01:21:03,164 --> 01:21:05,237
"She has stolen my heart away."

1159
01:21:05,566 --> 01:21:08,447
"She is giving me sleepless nights."

1160
01:21:08,569 --> 01:21:11,051
"Find out which village is she from."

1161
01:21:11,171 --> 01:21:14,280
"She is giving me sleepless nights."

1162
01:21:14,408 --> 01:21:16,687
"Find out which village is she from."

1163
01:21:16,811 --> 01:21:19,818
"She is giving me sleepless nights."

1164
01:21:19,914 --> 01:21:23,228
"Find out which village is she from."

1165
01:21:33,828 --> 01:21:36,812
"'Which area, which sector,
which road leads me to her."

1166
01:21:36,898 --> 01:21:39,643
"Find out the name,
I don't need anything else"

1167
01:21:39,767 --> 01:21:40,746
"I don't need anything else."

1168
01:21:41,002 --> 01:21:42,073
"I don't need anything else."

1169
01:21:42,302 --> 01:21:45,286
"'Which area, which sector,
which road leads me to her."

1170
01:21:45,405 --> 01:21:48,480
"Find out the name,
I don't need anything else"

1171
01:21:49,209 --> 01:21:54,665
"I have started sharing
my feelings with the stars."

1172
01:21:54,882 --> 01:21:57,764
"She is giving me sleepless nights."

1173
01:21:57,885 --> 01:22:00,333
"Find out which village is she from."

1174
01:22:00,421 --> 01:22:03,531
"She is giving me sleepless nights."

1175
01:22:03,658 --> 01:22:05,970
"Find out which village is she from."

1176
01:22:06,060 --> 01:22:08,873
"She is giving me sleepless nights."

1177
01:22:09,196 --> 01:22:12,271
"Find out which village is she from."

1178
01:22:12,399 --> 01:22:14,609
"Find out.. find out.. find out."

1179
01:23:33,781 --> 01:23:35,056
'What you did was not right.

1180
01:23:36,283 --> 01:23:38,128
You wish to defame me?

1181
01:23:40,555 --> 01:23:43,470
Oh really?
As if you haven't done anything.

1182
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:46,204
Fine.

1183
01:23:48,295 --> 01:23:49,867
Then see you in court.

1184
01:23:50,430 --> 01:23:52,936
Yes, I will see you there.

1185
01:24:01,776 --> 01:24:06,992
So Mr. Shanty,
any bitter-sweet memories?

1186
01:24:09,416 --> 01:24:10,726
What are you saying?

1187
01:24:11,385 --> 01:24:14,802
I never saw her in that manner.

1188
01:24:14,889 --> 01:24:16,335
Why? Did you remove your
glasses when you looked at her?

1189
01:24:18,492 --> 01:24:19,437
Silence.

1190
01:24:21,028 --> 01:24:21,632
Continue.

1191
01:24:22,196 --> 01:24:25,841
No. She is like a sister to me

1192
01:24:29,704 --> 01:24:31,549
A sister or like a sister?

1193
01:24:32,072 --> 01:24:33,279
Think over it and decide.

1194
01:24:33,975 --> 01:24:35,786
You have taken an
oath of Bhagavad-Gita.

1195
01:24:36,376 --> 01:24:39,053
You will be committing
a sin if you lie

1196
01:24:40,047 --> 01:24:43,726
Tell me the truth,
what did Gunjan ask you to say?

1197
01:24:46,020 --> 01:24:47,432
What did Gunjan teach you?

1198
01:24:48,656 --> 01:24:53,838
Gunjan said, "say I am your sister."

1199
01:24:57,497 --> 01:24:59,001
"Say I am like your sister."

1200
01:25:00,835 --> 01:25:02,144
Order. Order.

1201
01:25:02,837 --> 01:25:07,621
So Mr. Shanty,
what else did Gunjan teach you?

1202
01:25:10,011 --> 01:25:14,020
Gunjan told me not
to get scared in the court.

1203
01:25:15,049 --> 01:25:16,290
"Everyone is a fool."

1204
01:25:18,820 --> 01:25:21,599
Mr. Shanty, think about Gunjan.

1205
01:25:22,189 --> 01:25:24,798
What will happen to
her when she gets a divorce?

1206
01:25:25,059 --> 01:25:27,337
She will lose her
husband and her house

1207
01:25:27,628 --> 01:25:30,805
She will be left with nothing.
She will be on streets

1208
01:25:30,898 --> 01:25:33,141
She will have to
hitchhike with truckers.

1209
01:25:39,674 --> 01:25:40,619
Oh God.

1210
01:25:40,675 --> 01:25:41,654
N o.

1211
01:25:43,778 --> 01:25:45,817
Ranbir will divorce Gunjan?

1212
01:25:46,881 --> 01:25:48,225
He will make her live on the streets?

1213
01:25:48,683 --> 01:25:50,631
And I will keep quiet?

1214
01:25:51,619 --> 01:25:54,831
I will keep Gunjan close to my heart.

1215
01:25:56,957 --> 01:26:00,966
I will make a lavish house for Gunjan.

1216
01:26:04,398 --> 01:26:09,683
And when she gets a divorce
from this idiot, I will marry her.

1217
01:26:21,716 --> 01:26:27,764
Jaspreet, did you ever
share your lunch with Ranbir?

1218
01:26:28,656 --> 01:26:29,225
Yes sir.

1219
01:26:30,091 --> 01:26:31,036
Good, good, good.

1220
01:26:31,491 --> 01:26:36,606
And did Ranbir ever
share his lunch with you?

1221
01:26:37,799 --> 01:26:38,938
Of course

1222
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:43,742
The spiced prawn and kebabs
that he brings is superb.

1223
01:26:44,271 --> 01:26:46,253
I literally lick my fingers.

1224
01:26:46,907 --> 01:26:49,982
His wife makes excellent food.

1225
01:26:52,780 --> 01:26:58,737
Jaspreet. do you and Ranbir
share a hanky-panky type relationship?

1226
01:27:01,822 --> 01:27:04,327
No. He is my friend.

1227
01:27:04,992 --> 01:27:09,376
Ranbir is a very decent and nice man.

1228
01:27:10,698 --> 01:27:13,682
Friend. A decent man. - Yes

1229
01:27:14,101 --> 01:27:18,417
Jaspreet,
if this decent man loses the case.

1230
01:27:18,806 --> 01:27:20,810
Then he will be thrown
out of the house.

1231
01:27:21,041 --> 01:27:22,613
He will have to wander.

1232
01:27:22,777 --> 01:27:27,287
'What will you think,
what will you do, if all that happens?

1233
01:27:35,422 --> 01:27:37,530
First of all, I cannot
even think about such a thing.

1234
01:27:38,893 --> 01:27:41,968
I really want them to be together.

1235
01:27:43,097 --> 01:27:46,206
But they get divorced
then I will marry him

1236
01:27:50,237 --> 01:27:51,877
But only after they get divorced.

1237
01:27:52,439 --> 01:27:55,082
After that, I won't let him go.

1238
01:28:00,047 --> 01:28:01,687
Order. Order. Order

1239
01:28:03,450 --> 01:28:04,327
Silence.

1240
01:28:18,432 --> 01:28:19,879
Yes? What is it?

1241
01:28:21,702 --> 01:28:22,841
Why are you staring at me?

1242
01:28:25,206 --> 01:28:27,154
Can I say something, sir? -Yes Say.

1243
01:28:27,908 --> 01:28:31,381
You are here to speak.
After all you are a counselor.

1244
01:28:32,379 --> 01:28:35,090
No wedding is taking place
here that you have come for free food.

1245
01:28:35,683 --> 01:28:37,631
You are filling your
pockets with money.

1246
01:28:37,819 --> 01:28:39,458
'Will you say something now? Speak up.

1247
01:28:40,454 --> 01:28:41,833
Sir, see you at the next hearing.

1248
01:28:42,289 --> 01:28:46,765
Okay. Now you will make
a move to prolong this case

1249
01:28:47,161 --> 01:28:52,617
And behind my back you will say
that I keep postponing the hearings.

1250
01:28:53,033 --> 01:28:55,174
Today you are making
this accusation on me.

1251
01:28:55,269 --> 01:28:56,682
In future your son
will accuse me of the same

1252
01:28:56,804 --> 01:28:58,011
And he will ask..

1253
01:29:01,042 --> 01:29:05,655
All I get is a postponed
hearing, milord.

1254
01:29:06,013 --> 01:29:09,054
But I didn't get justice All I
got is the date for the next hearing

1255
01:29:09,717 --> 01:29:12,599
Daulat Singh,
if you drink tea in the court again..

1256
01:29:13,054 --> 01:29:14,797
You will continue to waste the time..

1257
01:29:14,889 --> 01:29:17,736
The bell will keep ringing,
papa will keep pleading..

1258
01:29:17,825 --> 01:29:21,641
And you will keep enjoying your tea

1259
01:29:22,029 --> 01:29:23,236
But we won't get justice, milord.

1260
01:29:23,363 --> 01:29:24,776
Stop this drama

1261
01:29:30,772 --> 01:29:33,756
The next hearing will take
place tomorrow and not after a month.

1262
01:29:34,008 --> 01:29:34,646
Tomorrow.

1263
01:29:39,179 --> 01:29:44,065
To be honest, I love both of you

1264
01:29:45,252 --> 01:29:46,858
I would love to see you every day.

1265
01:29:50,490 --> 01:29:53,964
Hocus-pocus abracadabra bow,
Ennie Minnie Miny Moe.

1266
01:29:54,061 --> 01:29:56,977
"Catch the tiger by the toe,
oh ghost he is my foe..

1267
01:29:57,064 --> 01:30:01,609
I wish to give him a blow,
now possess him and don't let him go.

1268
01:30:25,292 --> 01:30:26,534
What were you thinking about?

1269
01:30:28,362 --> 01:30:30,037
I know about your intentions

1270
01:30:31,198 --> 01:30:35,082
I have jumped passed many
like you to reach this seat.

1271
01:30:35,469 --> 01:30:36,677
A father shall always remain a father.

1272
01:30:36,804 --> 01:30:37,943
See you tomorrow.

1273
01:30:51,986 --> 01:30:53,398
'There is a wedding
in the neighbourhood.'

1274
01:30:53,754 --> 01:30:54,756
'We will have to go.'

1275
01:30:57,058 --> 01:30:58,630
'I cannot do drama'

1276
01:30:59,827 --> 01:31:02,777
'You'll have to stay in the same
neighbourhood if you get this house.'

1277
01:31:03,798 --> 01:31:05,244
'I won't go with you.'

1278
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:08,011
"Who said I am going with you?'

1279
01:31:08,235 --> 01:31:09,476
'I too have a standard.'

1280
01:31:09,704 --> 01:31:12,186
'I don't go with someone
who sells pickles'

1281
01:31:13,207 --> 01:31:13,982
<i>'Yum.</i>

1282
01:31:38,966 --> 01:31:42,611
'You.. you are like this top.'

1283
01:31:44,205 --> 01:31:45,652
'You will keep wandering.'

1284
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:48,483
'Oh really? - Yes'

1285
01:31:49,844 --> 01:31:52,486
'You are a hen. A hen'

1286
01:31:52,713 --> 01:31:53,818
"Who eats seeds.'

1287
01:32:13,100 --> 01:32:15,640
'I am ten steps ahead of you.'

1288
01:32:16,771 --> 01:32:18,251
ll Will Win.

1289
01:32:18,773 --> 01:32:20,686
'You will be left staring.'

1290
01:32:21,041 --> 01:32:24,549
'I won't just keep standing,
I am Bheem.'

1291
01:32:32,019 --> 01:32:33,762
'Listen to her talk.'

1292
01:32:38,259 --> 01:32:39,672
'You are a turncoat.'

1293
01:32:40,561 --> 01:32:42,166
'Look at this, you turncoat.'

1294
01:32:44,765 --> 01:32:48,045
'Look at this.
You are a wild cat. A cat.'

1295
01:34:05,646 --> 01:34:10,156
"You don't know who
you are messing with."

1296
01:36:31,492 --> 01:36:32,768
Order. Order.

1297
01:36:32,893 --> 01:36:33,838
Silence.

1298
01:36:37,097 --> 01:36:38,304
<i>What happened'?</i>

1299
01:36:38,566 --> 01:36:41,573
Milord, when you are
so surprised at his state..

1300
01:36:42,002 --> 01:36:46,318
...just imagine how harassed
my client must be feeling.

1301
01:36:46,674 --> 01:36:48,781
This poor guy is being
tortured while staying with her.

1302
01:36:49,276 --> 01:36:52,921
But why did his skin color change?

1303
01:36:53,014 --> 01:36:59,027
Milord, his wife tortures
him so much and in such a way..

1304
01:36:59,319 --> 01:37:02,770
...that my innocent client doesn't
even realise when he is in trouble.

1305
01:37:02,890 --> 01:37:04,336
Just a minute. Just a minute.

1306
01:37:04,458 --> 01:37:10,073
Either give us the facts, the evidence
or don't waste court's precious time.

1307
01:37:10,598 --> 01:37:13,707
Milord, I knew I would
have to give evidence

1308
01:37:13,801 --> 01:37:15,440
Hence today,
I have come well-prepared.

1309
01:37:15,736 --> 01:37:16,180
Just a minute.

1310
01:37:17,471 --> 01:37:19,511
Look at this, milord. 'What is this?

1311
01:37:20,975 --> 01:37:23,150
This is a prawn.

1312
01:37:23,377 --> 01:37:26,521
This isn't a prawn,
this is a time bomb.

1313
01:37:26,914 --> 01:37:30,228
One's body is bound to get affected
if one eats such things everyday.

1314
01:37:30,518 --> 01:37:32,557
He hasn't turned black by eating coal.

1315
01:37:38,526 --> 01:37:39,027
Okay. Okay.

1316
01:37:39,126 --> 01:37:41,130
Silence Silence. Silence.

1317
01:37:43,898 --> 01:37:49,650
Okay, do one thing,
from today, start eating vegetables

1318
01:37:50,004 --> 01:37:56,086
Like radishes, carrots
cauliflower, peas turnip, beet root.

1319
01:37:56,176 --> 01:37:59,992
Your complexion will get
better if you eat fresh vegetables

1320
01:38:00,281 --> 01:38:00,987
Yes

1321
01:38:01,215 --> 01:38:01,956
Got it?

1322
01:38:02,349 --> 01:38:02,987
Okay?

1323
01:38:03,383 --> 01:38:04,955
Go and rest now. Go on.

1324
01:38:05,085 --> 01:38:06,930
Excuse me, sir. Excuse me.

1325
01:38:07,254 --> 01:38:08,667
This isn't just.

1326
01:38:08,756 --> 01:38:10,704
If you are giving him,
his client some..

1327
01:38:10,792 --> 01:38:12,831
...time-off then my client
should also get some time-off.

1328
01:38:12,927 --> 01:38:15,375
The law is the same for everyone.

1329
01:38:15,897 --> 01:38:16,740
You too get some time-off.

1330
01:38:17,398 --> 01:38:18,309
Huh?

1331
01:38:19,767 --> 01:38:20,336
Strange

1332
01:38:20,768 --> 01:38:22,943
This generation is very fast.

1333
01:38:24,271 --> 01:38:29,487
Okay, now I will teach
you counselors a lesson.

1334
01:38:30,177 --> 01:38:31,988
You make a lot of files, don't you?

1335
01:38:32,980 --> 01:38:35,053
Now I will check your files.

1336
01:38:36,551 --> 01:38:38,624
Huh? What's written in this?

1337
01:38:39,053 --> 01:38:41,365
That Ranbir sometimes rapes?

1338
01:38:41,488 --> 01:38:44,666
Look at that, sir. Look at his habits.

1339
01:38:44,959 --> 01:38:50,073
Some people like to write,
some paint, some go trekking.

1340
01:38:50,164 --> 01:38:53,911
And he.. he sometimes rapes?

1341
01:38:54,001 --> 01:38:57,646
Oh my God.
The world doesn't deserve me, sir.

1342
01:38:58,573 --> 01:39:00,714
Milord, he has hidden
this fact from me as well.

1343
01:39:01,142 --> 01:39:01,985
Where is that written?

1344
01:39:02,409 --> 01:39:03,252
On which page?

1345
01:39:03,578 --> 01:39:04,318
Look for it yourself.

1346
01:39:04,879 --> 01:39:06,257
You are the one who prepared the file

1347
01:39:07,348 --> 01:39:10,856
Oh no, why are you accusing
my innocent client.

1348
01:39:11,552 --> 01:39:13,966
It's not rape, he sometimes rap. Rap.

1349
01:39:14,321 --> 01:39:15,460
R-A-R

1350
01:39:15,556 --> 01:39:16,695
Cancel the 'E'.

1351
01:39:17,592 --> 01:39:18,833
<i>When is amp';?</i>

1352
01:39:19,060 --> 01:39:20,062
'What are you saying, sir?

1353
01:39:20,327 --> 01:39:22,468
Nowadays every child knows to rap

1354
01:39:22,697 --> 01:39:26,649
Your children must be,
I never saw any child do it.

1355
01:39:29,537 --> 01:39:34,787
Daulat Singh, have you ever seen children
catching pigeons on the terrace?

1356
01:39:35,476 --> 01:39:38,859
There are some wall-less
terraces which make it very..

1357
01:39:38,946 --> 01:39:41,121
...easy for children to catch pigeons

1358
01:39:41,215 --> 01:39:43,698
It's a difference
issue that the problem..

1359
01:39:43,751 --> 01:39:48,033
...you have invited by
messing with papa's case.

1360
01:39:48,589 --> 01:39:50,297
...will make you forget how to move.

1361
01:39:50,390 --> 01:39:50,926
Hey..

1362
01:39:52,259 --> 01:39:53,501
What are you saying?

1363
01:39:54,461 --> 01:39:56,842
Do you know who are you talking to?

1364
01:39:57,097 --> 01:39:59,706
I will come down and slap you.

1365
01:39:59,800 --> 01:40:03,775
Don't yell or I will ruin your case.

1366
01:40:04,105 --> 01:40:06,053
There will be no
hearing or deliberation

1367
01:40:06,373 --> 01:40:08,321
There will be direct
judgment that too a quick one.

1368
01:40:11,612 --> 01:40:15,119
And when someone comes in
contact with this 2.5 grams hand.

1369
01:40:15,216 --> 01:40:17,859
...he doesn't go down, he goes up

1370
01:40:25,192 --> 01:40:25,728
Yes?

1371
01:40:26,093 --> 01:40:29,635
Milord, <i>I'll</i> present a rap to you.

1372
01:40:30,130 --> 01:40:31,702
Yo-yo.

1373

"ABCD, I am your daddy."

1374
01:40:34,468 --> 01:40:36,542
"If you mess with me,
I will be a baddy."

get myself a beautiful missy."

1377
01:40:41,542 --> 01:40:43,854

1380

Oh no.

1381
01:40:51,986 --> 01:40:53,330
Sir, this is called a rap.

1382
01:40:53,954 --> 01:40:55,697
This is worse than rape

1383
01:40:56,791 --> 01:40:57,930
You were bound to
find it offense, sir.

1384
01:40:58,459 --> 01:40:59,565
It is for the youth.

1385
01:40:59,860 --> 01:41:02,468
Listen, you can any
anything you want to me.

1386
01:41:02,997 --> 01:41:06,676
But don't make me
feel that I am not young.

1387
01:41:06,968 --> 01:41:09,975
Daulat Singh leaves
a young life, always

1388
01:41:11,138 --> 01:41:12,949
Even I can rap.

1389
01:41:13,974 --> 01:41:17,186
Sir, if you don'! mind,
I would like to say that..

1390
01:41:17,344 --> 01:41:21,262
...at this age you should take
God's name and improve your future.

1391
01:41:21,516 --> 01:41:23,258
Why are you getting into all this?

1392
01:41:23,918 --> 01:41:25,831
Rap is not your cup of tea.

1393
01:41:26,654 --> 01:41:27,963
Order. Order. Order

1394
01:41:28,188 --> 01:41:31,331
All you can do is say order.
You cannot sing rap.

1395
01:41:34,862 --> 01:41:36,741
I can give it in writing
You cannot do it.

1396
01:41:36,864 --> 01:41:38,709
I can give it in writing
You won't be able to do it, sir.

1397
01:41:39,867 --> 01:41:40,846
Rap!

1398
01:41:41,802 --> 01:41:44,444
Order! Order! Order!

1399
01:41:50,512 --> 01:41:54,931
"Johnny, Johnny, listen my boy."

1400
01:41:55,149 --> 01:41:59,067
"Today, <i>I will</i> turn you into a toy."

1401
01:41:59,386 --> 01:42:03,361
"Johnny, Johnny, listen my boy."

1402
01:42:03,725 --> 01:42:07,734
"Today, <i>I will</i> turn you into a toy."

1403
01:42:07,862 --> 01:42:12,509
"When I will attack, you will cry."

1404
01:42:12,600 --> 01:42:17,144
"Johnny, Johnny, listen my boy."

1405
01:42:17,672 --> 01:42:19,915
"You will go around in a diaper."

1406
01:42:20,007 --> 01:42:22,250
"I shall shoot you, I am a sniper."

1407
01:42:22,376 --> 01:42:26,796
"I shall clean your brain,
using a big wiper."

1408
01:42:26,914 --> 01:42:31,094
"Don't act smart,
<i>I'll</i> make you a

1409
01:42:31,185 --> 01:42:33,497
"Then I will stand and laugh.'

1410
01:42:33,588 --> 01:42:37,836
"Johnny, Johnny, listen my boy."

1411
01:42:38,258 --> 01:42:42,335
"Today, <i>I will</i> turn you into a toy."

1412
01:42:42,763 --> 01:42:46,977
"Johnny, Johnny, listen my boy."

1413
01:42:47,201 --> 01:42:49,650
"Yo-yo Daulat Singh."

1414
01:42:55,009 --> 01:42:57,252
So, how was it?

1415
01:43:01,115 --> 01:43:04,965
I have worked hard
to reach this position.

1416
01:43:06,655 --> 01:43:10,766
I have made decisions
of many difficult cases.

1417
01:43:11,458 --> 01:43:12,369
And I shall continue to do so.

1418
01:43:13,460 --> 01:43:22,116
But perhaps God alone shall decide on
this husband and wife's strange case.

1419
01:43:23,971 --> 01:43:26,249
Lord Almighty.

1420
01:43:46,694 --> 01:43:49,108
Hi. - Hi.

1421
01:43:51,566 --> 01:43:55,176
Survi.. - What happened?
Are you tired?

1422
01:43:56,003 --> 01:43:56,846
Why did you say hi to him?

1423
01:43:58,072 --> 01:44:00,350
You fought with him, I didn't.

1424
01:44:00,575 --> 01:44:02,146
He will always be my friend

1425
01:44:03,077 --> 01:44:05,526
How so? - What do
you mean by "how so"?

1426
01:44:07,381 --> 01:44:11,732
You are my friend
So how is he your friend?

1427
01:44:12,119 --> 01:44:15,536
Gunjan, we were friends
when you were together

1428
01:44:15,723 --> 01:44:19,037
Your relationship has changed,
mine hasn't.

1429
01:44:21,796 --> 01:44:24,369
You are saying that in
spite of seeing how I suffer?

1430
01:44:25,667 --> 01:44:27,375
I don't want your friendship.

1431
01:44:27,669 --> 01:44:29,240
Now many friendships will you break?

1432
01:44:31,772 --> 01:44:33,651
You are taking advantage
of the situation, aren't you?

1433
01:44:33,908 --> 01:44:35,947
I'm not taking advantage
I am talking some sense into you.

1434
01:44:36,177 --> 01:44:37,886
Stop it. It's enough.

1435
01:44:38,078 --> 01:44:40,151
You've dragged this way too far.

1436
01:44:40,481 --> 01:44:41,894
You make me laugh.

1437
01:44:42,617 --> 01:44:44,120
You got ruined for no reason at all.

1438
01:44:44,552 --> 01:44:47,934
Think after I leave
as to who is with you

1439
01:44:48,756 --> 01:44:51,295
And yes <i>I'll</i> give you an advice.

1440
01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:53,972
You should think when you are alone

1441
01:44:54,795 --> 01:44:56,366
It is healthy for you.

1442
01:45:08,075 --> 01:45:10,489
"Say it with your eyes."

1443
01:45:10,945 --> 01:45:13,554
"Whatever your heart hides"

1444
01:45:13,915 --> 01:45:16,558
"Whatever your heart hides"

1445
01:45:16,684 --> 01:45:19,223
"Say it with your eyes."

1446
01:45:20,120 --> 01:45:22,967
"Today, I don't know how.."

1447
01:45:23,190 --> 01:45:25,503
"Today, I don't know how.."

1448
01:45:25,960 --> 01:45:31,678
"Today, I don't know
how I expressed it."

1449
01:45:31,999 --> 01:45:34,505
"I am.. I

1450
01:45:34,736 --> 01:45:37,686
"I am in love with you"

1451
01:45:37,772 --> 01:45:40,311
"I am.. I

1452
01:45:40,575 --> 01:45:43,490

"I am.. I

"Say it with your eyes."

"Whatever your heart hides"

1456
01:45:51,919 --> 01:45:54,367
"Whatever your heart hides"

1457
01:45:54,689 --> 01:45:57,433
"Say it with your eyes."

1458
01:45:57,525 --> 01:46:02,502
"These eyes..
I am crying my heart out."

1459
01:46:02,597 --> 01:46:05,877
"Why am I at fault?"

1460
01:46:05,967 --> 01:46:09,440
"Why did I fall in love with you?"

1461
01:46:10,104 --> 01:46:15,651
"You looked into my eyes
and I made you dwell in my heart."

1462
01:46:15,876 --> 01:46:21,126
"I cannot bear being separated
from you even for a moment."

1463
01:46:27,522 --> 01:46:33,136
"You looked into my eyes
and I made you dwell in my heart."

1464
01:46:33,393 --> 01:46:38,974
"I cannot bear being separated
from you even for a moment."

1465
01:46:39,166 --> 01:46:44,645
"I cannot bear being separated
from you even for a moment."

1466
01:46:44,906 --> 01:46:47,788
"My life.."

1467
01:46:48,108 --> 01:46:50,386
"My only life."

1468
01:46:50,911 --> 01:46:56,697
"My life has become miserable."

1469
01:46:56,784 --> 01:46:59,357
"I am.. I

1470
01:46:59,654 --> 01:47:02,501
"I am in love with you"

01:47:02,590 --> 01:47:05,038
"I am.. I

01:47:05,125 --> 01:47:08,473
"I am in love with you"

"I am.. I

"Say it with your eyes."

1475
01:47:13,768 --> 01:47:16,182
"Whatever your heart hides"

1476
01:47:16,604 --> 01:47:19,246
"Whatever your heart hides"

1477
01:47:19,340 --> 01:47:22,051
"Say it with your eyes."

1478
01:47:40,728 --> 01:47:41,730
Where is she?

1479
01:47:42,697 --> 01:47:45,145
Mrs Gunjan,
you are standing over here?

1480
01:47:45,366 --> 01:47:47,075
I have been looking for you

1481
01:47:47,268 --> 01:47:48,373
Why do you look so sad?

1482
01:47:48,503 --> 01:47:49,881
You need not worry.

1483
01:47:50,104 --> 01:47:51,482
The case is in your favour.

1484
01:47:51,706 --> 01:47:54,052
He will be out of your
house and you will be free.

1485
01:47:54,341 --> 01:47:55,981
Then we will celebrate our victory.

1486
01:47:56,110 --> 01:47:58,525
We will have a party. Right?

1487
01:47:58,613 --> 01:47:59,991
Don't look so dejected.

1488
01:48:00,681 --> 01:48:02,560
Do you feel that
we will lose the case?

1489
01:48:02,984 --> 01:48:03,895
We will win.

1490
01:48:04,484 --> 01:48:05,088
You want to bet?

1491
01:48:05,486 --> 01:48:07,696
If I lose I will give you
back all the fees you paid me.

1492
01:48:07,888 --> 01:48:09,665
But if we win I will
charge you double

1493
01:48:12,527 --> 01:48:14,770
Mrs Gunjan, it will take some time.

1494
01:48:14,962 --> 01:48:17,571
I don't like that you
are waiting over here.

1495
01:48:17,865 --> 01:48:19,311
Do one thing,
go to the canteen and sit.

1496
01:48:19,534 --> 01:48:21,173
<i>I'll</i> come there and call you Okay?

1497
01:48:21,468 --> 01:48:23,074
I am going to the court.
<i>I'll</i> soon be back

1498
01:48:23,270 --> 01:48:24,181
I will call you.

1499
01:48:24,539 --> 01:48:27,351
Think that you are single
and climb the stairs quickly. Okay?

1500
01:48:27,474 --> 01:48:28,476
Okay, bye. - BYE-

1501
01:48:28,576 --> 01:48:31,081
See you. - See you. See you

1502
01:49:35,009 --> 01:49:35,647
Did you find them?

1503
01:49:36,010 --> 01:49:37,251
She isn't answering her phone

1504
01:49:38,779 --> 01:49:40,123
Did you take the money? - No.

1505
01:49:40,381 --> 01:49:40,883
You?

1506
01:49:43,117 --> 01:49:44,028
Call her up again

1507
01:49:47,755 --> 01:49:48,860
Where did they go?

1508
01:49:52,560 --> 01:49:53,767
I wonder where they went.

1509
01:51:05,900 --> 01:51:06,344
Careful.

1510
01:51:06,433 --> 01:51:07,344
'What are you doing?

1511
01:51:07,668 --> 01:51:09,376
You cannot get up. Please lie down.

1512
01:51:10,505 --> 01:51:11,347
Where is Gunjan?

1513
01:51:11,606 --> 01:51:13,314
She is fine. Lie down.

1514
01:51:13,741 --> 01:51:14,550
Where is my wife?

1515
01:51:14,676 --> 01:51:15,655
You cannot do this

1516
01:51:15,743 --> 01:51:16,586
I want to meet her.

1517
01:51:16,711 --> 01:51:17,690
Come on, calm down.

1518
01:51:18,212 --> 01:51:19,351
Please let me meet her.

1519
01:51:19,480 --> 01:51:21,257
Look, you are already very weak
- Where is Gunjan?

1520
01:51:21,348 --> 01:51:22,693
<i>I'll</i> have to give you an injection.

1521
01:51:23,083 --> 01:51:24,461
Please lie down.

1522
01:51:24,986 --> 01:51:25,658
Please.

1523
01:51:35,495 --> 01:51:36,236
You are leaving?

1524
01:51:36,463 --> 01:51:37,340
Yes. I am late.

1525
01:51:37,465 --> 01:51:37,739
Okay.

1526
01:51:37,865 --> 01:51:39,311
Hey, what happened to
that accident case patient?

1527
01:51:39,400 --> 01:51:42,145
They tried hard but
they couldn't save her.

1528
01:51:42,469 --> 01:51:45,112
It's sad. She had lost a lot of blood.

1529
01:51:45,472 --> 01:51:46,714
It was a very bad accident.

1530
01:51:46,808 --> 01:51:48,117
The chances of making
it through were difficult.

1531
01:51:48,375 --> 01:51:49,047
What about him?

1532
01:51:49,276 --> 01:51:51,885
His injuries are bad but
everything is in control now.

1533
01:51:52,012 --> 01:51:52,991
Okay. Bye.

1534
01:51:53,114 --> 01:51:53,991
See you tomorrow. - Okay. Bye.

1535
01:51:54,115 --> 01:51:54,719
Bye.

1536
01:54:19,393 --> 01:54:21,706
'Will you tell me where he is!

1537
01:54:23,664 --> 01:54:25,737
Don't you understand my problem?

1538
01:54:26,801 --> 01:54:28,578
I have been asking you from so long..

1539
01:54:31,471 --> 01:54:33,180
Why aren't you answering me?

1540
01:54:34,341 --> 01:54:38,293
You are ruthless.
You aren't telling me anything.

1541
01:54:42,950 --> 01:54:45,023
Why are you hiding it from me?

1542
01:54:45,920 --> 01:54:46,831
Please tell me

1543
01:54:47,354 --> 01:54:49,131
I am feeling very scared.

Please tell me what
happened to my husband.

You are a very stubborn patient.

1549

I don't want to listen
to your nonsense

1550
01:55:10,512 --> 01:55:13,290
Just tell me where my husband is.

1551
01:55:13,781 --> 01:55:15,785
You will die if you
continue to do this.

1552
01:55:16,417 --> 01:55:17,762
I don't care.

1553
01:55:19,587 --> 01:55:20,623
I don't care if I die.

You are not going to listen to me?

You are not going to
tell me where Ranbir is?

1556

Where is Ranbir?

1557
01:55:29,163 --> 01:55:30,769
Hello? Hello?

1558
01:55:31,365 --> 01:55:32,470
There is a patient
who is being stubborn.

1559
01:55:32,734 --> 01:55:35,547
She is creating a scene. Hurry up.

1560
01:56:38,332 --> 01:56:43,720
"These eyes..
I am crying my heart out."

1561
01:56:54,081 --> 01:56:57,156
"Why am I at fault?"

1562
01:56:57,284 --> 01:57:00,496
"Why did I fall in love with you?"

1563
01:57:48,936 --> 01:57:52,352
"These eyes.."

"If it had been revealed.."

1590
