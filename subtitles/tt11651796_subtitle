1
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,768
Could you let her through, please?

2
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:05,602
-Ma'am, cameras are not allowed.
-I'm with him. Anurag sir!

3
00:01:05,685 --> 00:01:07,602
Hey, brother, she's with me.

4
00:01:13,518 --> 00:01:14,518
Hey, Anurag!

5
00:01:18,643 --> 00:01:19,727
How are you, man?

6
00:01:21,477 --> 00:01:22,477
Nice going.

7
00:01:24,143 --> 00:01:25,977
You have your own paparazzi these days.

8
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,310
I should learn from you.

9
00:01:27,393 --> 00:01:28,852
Take a note of that, Jalal.

10
00:01:28,935 --> 00:01:32,060
Sir, a film school is making
a documentary, <i>Best Of Indian Cinema.</i>

11
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,477
The first episode is about me.

12
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,393
Mind blowing.

13
00:01:36,018 --> 00:01:38,560
I told them they won't
be able to top that.

14
00:01:38,643 --> 00:01:39,852
After me, everyone is shit.

15
00:01:40,477 --> 00:01:41,477
True.

16
00:01:45,268 --> 00:01:46,268
Hey, Anurag…

17
00:01:47,977 --> 00:01:49,518
Let's do a film together.

18
00:01:51,935 --> 00:01:53,810
I feel we should work together.

19
00:01:55,685 --> 00:01:58,977
This camera is shooting everything…

20
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,935
But, genuinely, let's do
a film together. I mean it, really.

21
00:02:02,018 --> 00:02:03,018
Seriously, man.

22
00:02:03,852 --> 00:02:06,643
Sir, it's been 17 years
since I offered you <i>Allwyn Kalicharan!</i>

23
00:02:07,602 --> 00:02:08,685
<i>Grant Hotel.</i>

24
00:02:10,685 --> 00:02:12,143
I've moved on.

25
00:02:12,852 --> 00:02:14,977
It was a different time.
I was a superstar.

26
00:02:15,727 --> 00:02:17,352
And actors at their peak are insecure.

27
00:02:17,435 --> 00:02:20,352
Your film wasn't going into production.
I couldn't take the risk.

28
00:02:21,727 --> 00:02:25,643
Can't do anything now.
You aren't hero material anymore

29
00:02:26,518 --> 00:02:27,852
I'm making films for Netflix,

30
00:02:27,935 --> 00:02:30,852
you're playing a grandfather
in <i>The Heart Searches.</i>

31
00:02:30,935 --> 00:02:33,143
It's <i>The Heart Beats.</i>

32
00:02:33,227 --> 00:02:34,768
Only a beating heart will search.

33
00:02:36,685 --> 00:02:38,185
Excuse me? Can you please stop this?

34
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,393
Hello? I'm speaking to you. Stop this.

35
00:02:44,518 --> 00:02:46,727
<i>So, Anil sir,</i>
<i>you've had such a long career.</i>

36
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:50,102
So many films, so many years,
thousands of interviews.

37
00:02:50,185 --> 00:02:53,227
You keep calling yourself
a "shameless actor."

38
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,018
What does that mean? Care to elaborate?

39
00:02:55,102 --> 00:02:56,352
Of course, I'm shameless!

40
00:02:57,102 --> 00:02:59,727
I've always been shameless.
Totally shameless!

41
00:03:00,393 --> 00:03:01,435
I remember <i>Mashaal.</i>

42
00:03:02,435 --> 00:03:03,268
<i>Mashaal, </i>Anurag.

43
00:03:03,852 --> 00:03:08,060
Dilip Kumar, Yash Chopra.
My first day, my first shot.

44
00:03:08,685 --> 00:03:10,227
Yusuf sir said his lines to me.

45
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,643
I was in character
so I didn't look at him.

46
00:03:12,727 --> 00:03:14,935
Three or four takes later,
he asked us to cut it.

47
00:03:15,018 --> 00:03:18,352
He told Yash <i>ji, </i>"Please, tell him
to look at me when I say my lines."

48
00:03:18,435 --> 00:03:20,310
Yash <i>ji</i> said, "Action."

49
00:03:20,393 --> 00:03:21,560
I didn't look at him again.

50
00:03:21,643 --> 00:03:24,685
I don't know what happened,
but he suddenly leapt at me.

51
00:03:25,268 --> 00:03:26,810
He held my face and said,

52
00:03:27,477 --> 00:03:29,852
"Kid, look at me."

53
00:03:29,935 --> 00:03:32,518
"Make eye contact with me
when I say my lines."

54
00:03:32,602 --> 00:03:33,560
But I refused.

55
00:03:34,227 --> 00:03:35,810
I refused because…

56
00:03:36,393 --> 00:03:37,727
Because I was in the character.

57
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,393
He was impressed!

58
00:03:39,477 --> 00:03:42,893
He told Yash <i>ji,</i> "Mark my words,
this boy is going to be a star!"

59
00:03:42,977 --> 00:03:49,268
And I won my first Filmfare Award
for the Best Supporting Actor for <i>Mashaal!</i>

60
00:03:52,143 --> 00:03:53,935
Today if I'm sitting here…

61
00:03:54,518 --> 00:03:56,102
in front of you all,

62
00:03:56,185 --> 00:03:59,268
it's because of my shamelessness.

63
00:04:00,227 --> 00:04:01,310
That's really sweet.

64
00:04:02,685 --> 00:04:04,768
I think we can open it up to the audience?

65
00:04:04,852 --> 00:04:06,727
-Yes, of course.
-Let's take some questions.

66
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:09,435
Okay, the gentleman
in the blue shirt at the back.

67
00:04:09,518 --> 00:04:10,643
Give him the mic, please.

68
00:04:10,727 --> 00:04:11,727
Yes, you have a question?

69
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,893
My question is for Anurag sir.

70
00:04:14,477 --> 00:04:18,102
Sir, what advice do you have
for young filmmakers like us?

71
00:04:18,185 --> 00:04:21,143
And how can we
make it big into the industry like you?

72
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:22,310
You can't.

73
00:04:22,393 --> 00:04:24,143
Anurag, that's not fair.

74
00:04:24,227 --> 00:04:25,268
Poor guy.

75
00:04:25,352 --> 00:04:27,018
Tell him something.

76
00:04:27,102 --> 00:04:28,685
What should I say? How old are you?

77
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,518
-Twenty-one.
-Twenty-one.

78
00:04:30,602 --> 00:04:32,393
These millennials, privileged kids,

79
00:04:32,977 --> 00:04:36,602
they come to their first film festival
and go, "Papa, I want to be a director."

80
00:04:37,185 --> 00:04:39,393
"Papa, that girl
isn't giving me any attention."

81
00:04:39,477 --> 00:04:42,727
Papa goes, "Here, take this camera,
go play filmmaking."

82
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:45,018
That's not how it works.
You don't succeed overnight.

83
00:04:45,102 --> 00:04:46,810
Until and unless your surname is Kapoor.

84
00:04:49,268 --> 00:04:51,143
Work hard.

85
00:04:51,643 --> 00:04:53,268
Struggle, like we did.

86
00:04:53,352 --> 00:04:58,268
In our industry, who is more important,
an actor or a director?

87
00:04:58,893 --> 00:05:03,393
That's a very interesting question.
I always wonder myself, also.

88
00:05:03,477 --> 00:05:04,685
-Anil sir?
-Story.

89
00:05:05,768 --> 00:05:06,602
Story.

90
00:05:07,268 --> 00:05:08,727
A film won't work without a story.

91
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:12,393
But to answer to your question,

92
00:05:12,477 --> 00:05:15,102
actor and director,
both are equally important.

93
00:05:15,185 --> 00:05:19,227
But I don't think
Anurag quite agrees with that, right?

94
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,893
I think he has something to say.

95
00:05:22,477 --> 00:05:24,602
What can I say to him?

96
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,935
When a film is made,
it's made through a camera.

97
00:05:29,852 --> 00:05:31,477
The camera has only one viewfinder.

98
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,768
-Yes, but--
-An actor's medium is the stage.

99
00:05:33,852 --> 00:05:40,060
But in my opinion, people come
to the theater to watch the actor.

100
00:05:40,143 --> 00:05:42,643
Your medium is the stage.
You can sing, dance, or do a cabaret.

101
00:05:42,727 --> 00:05:43,560
That, I agree.

102
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:46,685
The film is made by the director.
It is the director's vision--

103
00:05:46,768 --> 00:05:51,102
With the director's face on the poster,
the film won't run even for two days.

104
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:54,185
-That only happens in India.
-Really?

105
00:05:54,268 --> 00:05:56,560
People watch films
only for celebrities in India.

106
00:05:56,643 --> 00:05:58,477
There are film industries
outside India, too.

107
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,393
I agree.

108
00:05:59,477 --> 00:06:00,310
Really?

109
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:02,602
Go to Europe, Venice, Cannes, Berlin.

110
00:06:02,685 --> 00:06:05,810
People queue up for the director,
including the actors.

111
00:06:05,893 --> 00:06:07,143
Anurag, here is a suggestion.

112
00:06:07,227 --> 00:06:09,060
Why don't you settle down in Europe?

113
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,768
Go and show your skills there.

114
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,268
Who knows him?

115
00:06:16,018 --> 00:06:17,185
Who knows him?

116
00:06:17,768 --> 00:06:19,935
The box office
of all his films put together

117
00:06:20,018 --> 00:06:22,393
is less than the box office
of his brother's flop film.

118
00:06:22,477 --> 00:06:26,810
Sir, in 2020,
you've turned into Mr. India again.

119
00:06:26,893 --> 00:06:28,643
You've disappeared from the screens.

120
00:06:28,727 --> 00:06:30,060
Invisible and irrelevant.

121
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:31,602
And are you relevant?

122
00:06:32,143 --> 00:06:33,268
Were you ever relevant?

123
00:06:33,352 --> 00:06:37,518
Your shoes are
Karan Johar's second-hand shoes

124
00:06:37,602 --> 00:06:38,810
Got it?

125
00:06:38,893 --> 00:06:41,310
Everybody knows you, Anurag Kashyap.

126
00:06:41,393 --> 00:06:44,435
These are original Balenciagas.
I bought them. They aren't second-hand.

127
00:06:44,518 --> 00:06:45,560
Look at mine!

128
00:06:45,643 --> 00:06:47,393
-Guys…
-Result of my hard work.

129
00:06:47,477 --> 00:06:50,310
-Mine are more expensive.
-…move on. Gentlemen, I think--

130
00:06:50,393 --> 00:06:52,435
Who has seen his films?
He's a parody of himself.

131
00:06:52,518 --> 00:06:54,143
Biggest fraud in the industry.

132
00:06:54,227 --> 00:06:56,060
-Everyone watched them.
-No one has.

133
00:06:56,143 --> 00:06:57,810
<i>-Gangs of…</i>
<i>-Wasseypur!</i>

134
00:06:57,893 --> 00:06:58,727
Listen to that.

135
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:02,018
Have you watched porn?
Everyone watches porn! Right or wrong?

136
00:07:02,102 --> 00:07:04,060
Remove the cuss words from his films,

137
00:07:04,143 --> 00:07:06,268
and even the citizens of Wasseypur
won't watch them.

138
00:07:06,352 --> 00:07:07,602
Sir, what about you?

139
00:07:07,685 --> 00:07:11,310
He wants to be a hero at this age.

140
00:07:11,393 --> 00:07:13,685
"My Name Is Lakhan"
is a thing of the past.

141
00:07:13,768 --> 00:07:16,643
"My Name is Lakhan…"
Now you're Anil uncle.

142
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,435
-He's one to talk.
-Okay…

143
00:07:20,352 --> 00:07:22,227
He wants to be a hero
at this grand old age.

I just confirmed

180
00:08:55,018 --> 00:08:56,727
Let me talk to him.

Hello, Nawaz?

185
00:09:07,102 --> 00:09:08,977
-This is Anurag speaking.
<i>-Yes…</i>

186
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:13,852
Why am I getting messages from the media
that you've canceled our shoot dates?

187
00:09:13,935 --> 00:09:17,602
<i>Your producer was quoting peanuts</i>
<i>and I'm tired of doing dark films.</i>

188
00:09:17,685 --> 00:09:19,102
You should've told me!

189
00:09:19,852 --> 00:09:22,977
Why the fuck does the media
know about it? It's on the news!

190
00:09:23,518 --> 00:09:26,435
<i>-Anurag--</i>

00:09:42,268 --> 00:09:44,977
Fucking Nawazuddin Siddiqui
hung up on Anurag Kashyap?

199
00:09:48,435 --> 00:09:49,310
Sir?

200
00:09:54,643 --> 00:09:57,018
Sir, I think you should do something.

201
00:09:59,393 --> 00:10:00,685
I'm thinking about it.

202
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:04,477
I have an idea.

00:10:49,602 --> 00:10:51,310
DADASAHEB PHALKE CHITRANAGARI

204
00:11:20,768 --> 00:11:22,477
I'll FUCK YOU UP

205
00:11:29,727 --> 00:11:31,602
Sir, I'm a big fan of yours.

206
00:11:31,685 --> 00:11:34,102
-I'm a big fan of myself, too.
-Thank you, sir.

207
00:11:48,852 --> 00:11:50,268
And cut!

208
00:11:50,768 --> 00:11:52,810
Great shot, sir! Superb!

209
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:02,560
Anurag sir, I'm Rohini.

210
00:12:02,643 --> 00:12:04,852
-Hi. Anurag.
-Sorry. I'm the assistant director here.

211
00:12:04,935 --> 00:12:07,060
Why are you saying sorry?
It could be worse.

212
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,935
Yes, sir, but actually,
shooting is not allowed here.

213
00:12:10,018 --> 00:12:11,560
I can't shoot on a studio floor?

214
00:12:11,643 --> 00:12:13,018
Not on our set.

215
00:12:13,518 --> 00:12:15,227
I'm here to meet the birthday boy.

216
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:16,727
I'll let him know.

217
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:19,143
But while you wait,
please turn off the camera.

218
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,852
But isn't the shooting over?

219
00:12:21,935 --> 00:12:23,977
Sir, please understand, I'll tell him.

220
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,227
-Okay, tell him I'm waiting.
-Sure.

221
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:27,393
Camera off.

222
00:12:29,935 --> 00:12:32,518
He saw me. He'll come now. Let's go.

223
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:49,143
Sir, cake.

224
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:52,102
-Did he send it for me?
-No. It's leftover.

225
00:12:54,518 --> 00:12:55,768
-Thank you.
-Welcome.

226
00:13:08,185 --> 00:13:12,727
<i>O Anil Kapoor, come to see me</i>

227
00:13:13,727 --> 00:13:15,477
<i>I always…</i>

228
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,935
There he is.

229
00:13:17,018 --> 00:13:17,977
<i>…knew</i>

230
00:13:18,977 --> 00:13:20,518
Happy birthday, sir.

231
00:13:21,352 --> 00:13:22,852
Sorry, I came uninvited.

232
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:25,935
You've blocked me on your phone.

233
00:13:26,018 --> 00:13:27,852
I've something important to discuss.

234
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:31,643
Isn't your documentary over yet?

235
00:13:32,477 --> 00:13:36,227
Are you still his assistant
or have you graduated to girlfriend?

236
00:13:42,768 --> 00:13:44,352
He's Nostradamus now.

237
00:13:44,435 --> 00:13:45,435
Let's go.

238
00:14:03,768 --> 00:14:04,893
Hello, sir.

239
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:07,185
I need to speak with you in private.

240
00:14:11,227 --> 00:14:14,768
I want to narrate a script to you.

241
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:16,352
Hello, sir.

242
00:14:18,435 --> 00:14:20,518
It's a killer story. You'll love it.

243
00:14:29,852 --> 00:14:31,393
Should I be polite or brash?

244
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,727
Well, Jalal, it seems…

245
00:14:37,768 --> 00:14:39,560
people can see Mr. India again now.

246
00:14:41,477 --> 00:14:44,185
You must have seen
that I'm doing an Air Force film now.

247
00:14:44,768 --> 00:14:47,352
I'm doing Karan's <i>Takht </i>right after.

248
00:14:48,227 --> 00:14:50,435
And then I'm doing
a Hollywood film with Tom.

249
00:14:50,518 --> 00:14:51,602
Cruise?

250
00:14:51,685 --> 00:14:53,018
That's already done.

251
00:14:53,102 --> 00:14:54,060
Hanks?

252
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,352
That was Irrfan.

253
00:14:56,435 --> 00:14:58,852
-Then, which Tom?
-What's his name?

254
00:14:58,935 --> 00:15:01,435
-My buddy from UK… <i>Mad Max.</i>
-Hardy. Tom Hardy.

255
00:15:01,518 --> 00:15:03,102
Yes, Tom Hardy.

256
00:15:03,185 --> 00:15:05,310
I don't have dates for the next two years.

257
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:08,143
Sir, please, just hear it out.

258
00:15:08,227 --> 00:15:10,143
If you don't like it,
block me from the sets.

259
00:15:10,227 --> 00:15:14,727
If you want me to say, "Okay,
narrate the story, I'll consider it,"

260
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:17,602
I'll still say that I don't have the time.

261
00:15:18,893 --> 00:15:20,352
A week later, you'll WhatsApp me,

262
00:15:20,435 --> 00:15:23,560
though you know that I have blocked you.

263
00:15:24,602 --> 00:15:26,143
I have, haven't I?

264
00:15:26,227 --> 00:15:28,435
Did you try? You're blocked, aren't you?

265
00:15:29,435 --> 00:15:32,643
Then you'll come to my set
and wait around like a fucker.

266
00:15:32,727 --> 00:15:36,393
I'll still tell you the same thing,
I don't have the time. Okay?

267
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:37,768
Now, off you go.

268
00:15:37,852 --> 00:15:39,685
Sir, it is an insane story.

269
00:15:39,768 --> 00:15:42,227
Nobody has
ever written a story like this.

270
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:44,060
My kids are waiting for me.

271
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:46,102
Jalal, go and get the car ready.

272
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,560
Sorry.

273
00:15:59,768 --> 00:16:01,477
Sonam is also in the film.

274
00:16:02,518 --> 00:16:04,143
-Sonam?
-Yes.

275
00:16:04,227 --> 00:16:05,977
-In your film?
-Yes.

276
00:16:07,018 --> 00:16:08,685
And I'm playing her father, yeah?

277
00:16:08,768 --> 00:16:10,560
The story is about the father.

278
00:16:11,893 --> 00:16:13,227
A hostage thriller.

279
00:16:15,393 --> 00:16:17,143
There's an actor who is a celebrity.

280
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:20,268
He's done TV shows, Hollywood films.

281
00:16:20,352 --> 00:16:23,810
He has three kids, a wife, and a dog.

282
00:16:23,893 --> 00:16:27,268
His career is over, but he still thinks
he's at the top of his game.

283
00:16:32,352 --> 00:16:33,268
And?

284
00:16:33,852 --> 00:16:36,602
His daughter,
the only star in the family now,

285
00:16:36,685 --> 00:16:38,102
gets kidnapped one fine day.

286
00:16:38,185 --> 00:16:41,185
And a director,
this mad director who makes dark films,

287
00:16:41,268 --> 00:16:43,518
whose brother
is the only one with a hit film,

288
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:44,977
he kidnaps her.

289
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,310
-You?
-Correct.

290
00:16:46,935 --> 00:16:48,768
-And then?
-I don't know.

291
00:16:48,852 --> 00:16:51,518
-You don't know?
-That's what I am here to figure out.

292
00:16:51,602 --> 00:16:52,852
What do you mean?

293
00:16:52,935 --> 00:16:55,685
I mean, the film has started,

294
00:16:56,268 --> 00:16:57,810
the camera is on.

295
00:16:57,893 --> 00:17:01,310
The hero of the film,
the father, is you. I'm the villain.

296
00:17:01,393 --> 00:17:03,685
And can you guess who has been kidnapped?

297
00:17:03,768 --> 00:17:04,602
Sonam.

298
00:17:04,685 --> 00:17:06,810
That's the right answer, sir!

299
00:17:11,977 --> 00:17:14,310
You don't get to make movies,

300
00:17:14,393 --> 00:17:16,268
so you're making a reality show.

301
00:17:17,268 --> 00:17:20,060
You're trying to prank me
with a candid camera.

302
00:17:21,268 --> 00:17:23,810
This sounds like a stoner's idea.

303
00:17:25,518 --> 00:17:28,227
This is not a reality show.

304
00:17:30,227 --> 00:17:31,227
Look, Anurag,

305
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:35,185
I don't have time for your stupid ideas.

306
00:17:36,227 --> 00:17:40,352
I have a birthday dinner to go to.
My family is waiting for me.

307
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,143
Here's a suggestion.

308
00:17:43,977 --> 00:17:46,185
Take this shitty idea to, what's his name…

309
00:17:46,268 --> 00:17:47,602
Take it to Nawazuddin.

310
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:49,643
He'll do your film.

311
00:17:51,893 --> 00:17:53,852
Why don't you make a call?

312
00:17:54,768 --> 00:17:55,643
To whom?

313
00:17:55,727 --> 00:17:56,893
Sonam.

314
00:17:56,977 --> 00:17:58,560
You want me to call Sonam?

315
00:17:58,643 --> 00:18:00,893
For this shitty idea of yours?

316
00:18:01,518 --> 00:18:03,643
She's busier than I am.

317
00:18:05,393 --> 00:18:06,852
Try calling her once.

318
00:18:08,393 --> 00:18:10,393
I've already abused you.

319
00:18:10,477 --> 00:18:12,727
I can do it again
because you made <i>Wasseypur.</i>

320
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:14,810
You're not an ordinary fucker,

321
00:18:14,893 --> 00:18:17,602
you're the Chris Hemsworth of fuckers,
you are right at the top!

322
00:18:21,435 --> 00:18:23,310
Thinks he can make a film with Sonam.

323
00:18:54,185 --> 00:18:56,060
Why do you have Sonam's phone?

324
00:18:56,768 --> 00:18:57,727
Sir…

325
00:18:58,352 --> 00:19:00,768
You are not listening to me.

326
00:19:00,852 --> 00:19:02,560
I have Sonam, too.

327
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:05,227
Why would Sonam give you her phone?

328
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,185
Sonam didn't give me her phone, Papa.

329
00:19:07,268 --> 00:19:10,102
You don't listen, do you?
I took the phone from Sonam.

330
00:19:14,393 --> 00:19:16,935
What kind of nonsense is this?
What are you up to?

331
00:19:17,018 --> 00:19:19,018
Give me the phone.
Give me Sonam's phone.

332
00:19:19,102 --> 00:19:21,227
This is not nonsense, Papa.

333
00:19:23,935 --> 00:19:28,060
This is the most dangerous
hostage thriller in the world of cinema.

334
00:19:28,893 --> 00:19:31,060
It's happening and happening now.

335
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,893
You don't have to act at all.
Sonam Kapoor is missing.

336
00:19:34,977 --> 00:19:37,810
You have to find her before sunrise.

337
00:19:38,643 --> 00:19:40,435
Everything is real here.

338
00:19:40,518 --> 00:19:44,477
Your search for her is real.
You'll get hurt for real.

339
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,852
You'll bleed for real.

340
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:48,685
You will cry for real.

341
00:19:48,768 --> 00:19:50,602
You will laugh for…

342
00:19:51,435 --> 00:19:52,643
You won't laugh.

343
00:19:53,185 --> 00:19:54,935
You won't have any body doubles,

344
00:19:55,018 --> 00:19:58,393
no retakes, no mistakes.

345
00:19:58,477 --> 00:20:02,143
The first realistic film with a superstar,
not directed by Shyam Benegal.

346
00:20:03,185 --> 00:20:04,727
We're going to make this film.

347
00:20:05,435 --> 00:20:06,560
Are you in?

348
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,852
Don't put this in my face.
Just go and sit there!

349
00:20:10,935 --> 00:20:12,185
Sit there!

350
00:20:13,393 --> 00:20:15,893
Alisha, where is Sonam?

351
00:20:18,768 --> 00:20:20,435
What do you mean you don't know?

352
00:20:21,643 --> 00:20:23,268
Why didn't you go to work today?

353
00:20:25,935 --> 00:20:27,518
Yes, everything is fine.

354
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:29,810
No, I'll speak with her.

355
00:20:29,893 --> 00:20:31,435
You take care.

356
00:20:31,518 --> 00:20:33,185
I will speak to her. Bye.

357
00:20:33,268 --> 00:20:35,310
Sonam's manager
has an upset stomach, right?

358
00:20:35,393 --> 00:20:36,810
Food poisoning?

359
00:20:36,893 --> 00:20:38,185
All of a sudden?

360
00:20:38,685 --> 00:20:40,185
What the fuck, Anurag?

361
00:20:41,018 --> 00:20:42,393
How are you doing this?

362
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:45,685
How do you know about her upset stomach?

363
00:20:46,268 --> 00:20:48,435
There are three rules.

364
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:52,685
First rule,
you cannot call the police.

365
00:20:52,768 --> 00:20:55,060
Second rule,
you cannot involve any outsiders.

366
00:20:55,143 --> 00:20:55,977
Third rule,

367
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:59,310
this camera will continue shooting even if
the God of Death walks into the frame.

368
00:21:01,435 --> 00:21:03,685
Give me the phone.
Tell me where she is.

369
00:21:03,768 --> 00:21:06,102
Why don't you look for Sonam?

370
00:21:06,185 --> 00:21:08,893
You have ten hours. Only ten hours!

371
00:21:08,977 --> 00:21:11,727
The sun will rise by then,
and I'll have to go for a swim.

372
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:13,560
And the fourth rule.

373
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:17,227
All calls on speakerphone.

374
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:20,727
I need to hear who you're talking to.

375
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:22,893
A monologue
won't make sense to the audience.

376
00:21:22,977 --> 00:21:24,852
Hello? Sonam Kapoor's phone.

377
00:21:24,935 --> 00:21:26,810
<i>Hello? Hi, is Sonam there?</i>

378
00:21:26,893 --> 00:21:29,143
Sonam Kapoor is unavailable.

379
00:21:29,685 --> 00:21:32,310
<i>Is she on the way to the show?</i>
<i>We're waiting for her. It's urgent.</i>

380
00:21:32,393 --> 00:21:35,602
I'm sorry, Sonam Kapoor is not
going to be anywhere, anytime soon.

381
00:21:35,685 --> 00:21:37,018
I'm really sorry.

382
00:21:38,435 --> 00:21:40,352
Look, Anurag, I'm trying to be polite.

383
00:21:41,435 --> 00:21:43,310
Don't provoke the devil in me.

384
00:21:43,393 --> 00:21:46,060
It's the right time to bring him out.

385
00:21:46,143 --> 00:21:49,977
The Rakhwala, Lakhan, Munna, Nayak in you,

386
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,810
bring them all out.

387
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:53,935
You have only ten hours.

388
00:21:54,018 --> 00:21:55,518
Time is running out.

389
00:21:55,643 --> 00:21:57,768
Tik-tok, tik-tok…

390
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:03,685
You fuck-face, tell me where is she.

391
00:22:03,768 --> 00:22:07,018
Sir, the camera is on. We're live.

392
00:22:07,935 --> 00:22:11,227
If you hold my collar here,
someone will do it to Sonam there.

393
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:15,227
If you hit me, beat me,
kick me around, anything at all,

394
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:16,893
Sonam will go through the same.

395
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:20,435
Anything can happen to her.

396
00:22:20,518 --> 00:22:22,727
You are running out of time.
Just ten hours.

397
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:23,810
Go save her.

398
00:22:28,393 --> 00:22:29,393
Hey, Sabir!

399
00:22:30,018 --> 00:22:31,977
Who let him inside?

400
00:22:34,768 --> 00:22:36,143
Call the commissioner.

401
00:22:37,643 --> 00:22:40,893
Not the income tax commissioner,
call the police commissioner!

402
00:22:42,685 --> 00:22:43,935
That's a great idea.

403
00:22:44,643 --> 00:22:46,518
He's not answering the phone.

404
00:22:46,602 --> 00:22:47,935
You're doing his film, right?

405
00:22:48,018 --> 00:22:49,227
His film?

406
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:50,727
Yes, the kidnapping one.

407
00:22:52,018 --> 00:22:53,727
What the fuck are you saying, Jalal?

408
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:55,643
It's a superb idea.
Thrillers are his thing.

409
00:22:55,727 --> 00:22:58,102
-Next year, July?
-But he is busy for two years.

410
00:22:58,185 --> 00:22:59,643
I'll always be busy for you.

411
00:22:59,727 --> 00:23:01,977
Go home and handle Sunita.

412
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,310
I'll get rid of him.

413
00:23:04,018 --> 00:23:05,935
Sabir, are there any police stations here?

414
00:23:06,018 --> 00:23:07,852
-Dindoshi.
-Dindoshi.

415
00:23:11,935 --> 00:23:13,893
Get out of my way! Dindoshi!

416
00:23:31,852 --> 00:23:32,852
Anurag Basu!

417
00:23:47,352 --> 00:23:49,727
Who's the inspector? Its urgent.

418
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:52,518
One second, sir.
Go tell sir that Anil Kapoor has come.

419
00:23:52,602 --> 00:23:53,810
Sir, this way.

420
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:56,143
Please, come. Move aside.

421
00:23:56,227 --> 00:23:57,518
Move aside, everyone.

422
00:23:57,602 --> 00:24:01,018
Sir, can I please have a selfie?
It will be great.

423
00:24:01,102 --> 00:24:03,643
-Quickly.
-I watched <i>Woh 7 Din</i> seven times.

424
00:24:05,185 --> 00:24:07,060
Mr. Madhur Bhandarkar is also here!

425
00:24:07,143 --> 00:24:09,518
Please come, sir.

426
00:24:10,768 --> 00:24:11,685
Sir!

427
00:24:11,768 --> 00:24:13,727
Please go in. I'll get it.
Yogita, inside.

428
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:15,685
Hello, sir. Have a seat.

429
00:24:17,143 --> 00:24:19,102
Why don't you head to the waiting room?

430
00:24:19,185 --> 00:24:20,935
I'll join you there.

431
00:24:21,435 --> 00:24:23,185
Can we get a photo with him?

432
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:26,560
Please, if you don't mind,
this is my family.

433
00:24:26,643 --> 00:24:27,685
-Sure.
-Thank you.

434
00:24:29,602 --> 00:24:31,435
-Thank you very much.
-Can we get one more?

435
00:24:31,518 --> 00:24:32,768
Please, head. I'll join you.

436
00:24:32,852 --> 00:24:34,602
Please wait, I will call.

437
00:24:36,018 --> 00:24:37,810
Please, come. How can I help you?

438
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:39,685
Inspector.

439
00:24:41,268 --> 00:24:42,810
This man in the helmet,

440
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,643
his name is Anurag Kashyap.

441
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:48,893
He says that he has kidnapped my daughter.

442
00:24:48,977 --> 00:24:51,393
One minute. Your daughter, Sonam Kapoor?

443
00:24:51,477 --> 00:24:52,477
Yes.

444
00:24:53,268 --> 00:24:55,643
And that if I don't find her by morning,

445
00:24:55,727 --> 00:24:57,185
he might harm her.

446
00:24:58,393 --> 00:25:00,477
Did you kidnap his daughter?

447
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,893
-I'm talking to you.
-Yes, sir.

448
00:25:01,977 --> 00:25:03,560
Come and take a seat, please.

449
00:25:03,643 --> 00:25:04,768
We're making a film--

450
00:25:04,852 --> 00:25:06,018
Why is the camera here?

451
00:25:06,102 --> 00:25:08,560
-We are shooting for a film.
-No, we're not.

452
00:25:08,643 --> 00:25:10,935
We've been trying
to do this film since 2003.

453
00:25:11,018 --> 00:25:13,727
We finally got a chance to do it.
This is a rehearsal.

454
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:16,852
This is not a rehearsal.

455
00:25:16,935 --> 00:25:19,227
-Do you have any proof?
-Yes, I do.

456
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:22,310
He has my daughter's phone.
Ask him where he got it from.

457
00:25:22,393 --> 00:25:24,852
-Do you have the phone?
-Sonam Kapoor gave it to me--

458
00:25:24,935 --> 00:25:26,602
Why would Sonam give it to you?

459
00:25:26,685 --> 00:25:28,643
Why don't you ask Sonam about it?

460
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:30,810
How will I ask her if you have her phone?

461
00:25:30,893 --> 00:25:33,018
I narrated the scene to her.

462
00:25:33,102 --> 00:25:35,060
She gave me her phone for the rehearsal.

463
00:25:35,143 --> 00:25:37,268
-Phone? Why would she…
-Why don't you ask her?

464
00:25:37,352 --> 00:25:40,310
How can I, when the phone is with you?

465
00:25:41,935 --> 00:25:42,852
Inspector,

466
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,560
he barged into my vanity van,

467
00:25:46,143 --> 00:25:49,227
and threatened me
that if I don't do his shitty film,

468
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:51,185
he'll kill Sonam.

469
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:55,060
-Please, will you stop the camera?
-Move away.

470
00:25:55,143 --> 00:25:56,268
Just move from there.

471
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,810
Sir, what he is telling you
is actually the story of my film.

472
00:26:02,893 --> 00:26:05,310
Why are you telling them the story?

473
00:26:05,393 --> 00:26:07,268
I'm not doing your film!

474
00:26:07,768 --> 00:26:09,768
Why would I do this fucker's film?

475
00:26:10,435 --> 00:26:11,727
This is Anurag Kashyap!

476
00:26:12,685 --> 00:26:15,185
Not Anurag Basu or Madhur Bhandarkar!

477
00:26:15,268 --> 00:26:17,102
He isn't Vishal Bhardwaj either!

478
00:26:17,185 --> 00:26:18,560
No one knows this guy!

479
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:21,560
His face is in the newspapers

480
00:26:21,643 --> 00:26:23,852
only because he abuses everyone!

481
00:26:23,935 --> 00:26:27,060
Inspector, I want my wife
and her phone back.

482
00:26:27,143 --> 00:26:29,477
Wait a second. Is your wife missing, too?

483
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,477
My daughter.

484
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:33,143
-But you said your wife.
-Slip of the tongue, maybe!

485
00:26:33,893 --> 00:26:36,310
Arrest him and ask him
where my daughter is.

486
00:26:37,518 --> 00:26:39,810
My kids are waiting for me at home.

487
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:43,310
I'm begging you!

488
00:26:53,935 --> 00:26:55,310
Wow!

489
00:26:55,393 --> 00:26:56,643
Brilliant!

490
00:26:56,727 --> 00:26:59,310
-That was an amazing performance.
-Brilliant!

491
00:26:59,393 --> 00:27:01,227
Every actor on one side…

492
00:27:02,268 --> 00:27:03,602
and Anil sir on the other.

493
00:27:03,685 --> 00:27:04,977
It's a superhit.

494
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:07,852
Anurag sir, mark my words,
this film will be huge.

495
00:27:07,935 --> 00:27:09,477
-I know.
-What brilliant acting!

496
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,935
-This is not acting.
-You might need the riot police.

497
00:27:12,018 --> 00:27:14,685
Inspector, I'm not acting.

498
00:27:14,768 --> 00:27:15,935
-I told him.
-What?

499
00:27:16,018 --> 00:27:19,810
Anurag had told us
that you would come here to rehearse.

500
00:27:19,893 --> 00:27:21,643
He narrated the plot of the film.

501
00:27:21,727 --> 00:27:24,852
It's not a rehearsal. Inspector, listen,
this is not a rehearsal.

502
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:28,060
He really gets
into the skin of the character.

503
00:27:28,143 --> 00:27:30,352
-Acting?
-Even after the film is over.

504
00:27:30,435 --> 00:27:31,435
This is not acting!

505
00:27:31,518 --> 00:27:34,185
It really doesn't feel like acting,
from any angle.

506
00:27:34,268 --> 00:27:36,893
-This is what we call method acting.
-What?

507
00:27:36,977 --> 00:27:40,143
Someone named Stanislavski
from Russia invented method acting.

508
00:27:40,227 --> 00:27:42,060
Ask him. He's won four Filmfare Awards.

509
00:27:42,143 --> 00:27:43,977
-Move!
-He's still in character.

510
00:27:44,893 --> 00:27:46,227
Thank you so much.

511
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:47,810
Yes, what's up?

512
00:27:48,935 --> 00:27:50,352
What are you talking about?

513
00:27:50,435 --> 00:27:52,143
Why the fuck should I do his film?

514
00:27:52,227 --> 00:27:54,352
Did you wake up
on the wrong side of the bed?

515
00:27:54,435 --> 00:27:56,518
Get your house checked by a <i>Vaastu</i> expert.

516
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,102
Who said that?

517
00:27:59,893 --> 00:28:00,935
When?

518
00:28:04,227 --> 00:28:06,227
-You tweeted about the film?
-Yes.

519
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:07,352
Motherfucker!

520
00:28:08,685 --> 00:28:10,893
Who the fuck are you trying to fool?

521
00:28:10,977 --> 00:28:13,643
Who are you trying to fool?
Did you kidnap Sonam?

522
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:15,852
You aren't getting the point.

523
00:28:18,893 --> 00:28:20,893
I said no police, which means no police.

524
00:28:21,977 --> 00:28:24,477
Try it again and you'll see
what happens to Sonam.

525
00:28:25,393 --> 00:28:28,768
An eye for an eye,
a nose for a nose, blood for blood.

526
00:28:28,852 --> 00:28:30,060
Show me the proof!

527
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:40,518
So you want proof.

528
00:28:47,727 --> 00:28:48,852
Where is this place?

529
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:50,977
That's what you need to figure out.

530
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:55,102
How do I know this is happening now?

531
00:28:55,727 --> 00:28:57,727
This could be
from the sets of one of her films.

532
00:28:59,352 --> 00:29:01,393
I think you don't watch Sonam's films.

533
00:29:02,227 --> 00:29:04,352
Master, please show him what you can do.

534
00:29:21,102 --> 00:29:23,977
You are still here? All well?

535
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:25,935
All well. <i>Jhakaas.</i>

536
00:29:27,435 --> 00:29:28,810
What are you watching?

537
00:29:31,935 --> 00:29:34,018
Auditions for my daughter's role.

538
00:29:34,852 --> 00:29:37,643
Okay. No wonder she resembles Sonam.

539
00:29:41,935 --> 00:29:44,018
Okay, see you later then.

540
00:29:44,727 --> 00:29:45,727
Take care.

541
00:29:46,727 --> 00:29:48,518
-Good night.
-Good night.

542
00:29:54,727 --> 00:29:55,977
And cut.

543
00:30:06,602 --> 00:30:07,602
You're crazy.

544
00:30:11,102 --> 00:30:13,935
How would I have survived
the industry if I wasn't crazy?

545
00:30:17,477 --> 00:30:21,560
You haven't seen how crazy I can get.

546
00:30:23,352 --> 00:30:24,352
So tell me,

547
00:30:25,268 --> 00:30:26,977
are you doing the film or not?

548
00:30:32,435 --> 00:30:33,435
Yes.

549
00:30:34,185 --> 00:30:35,227
Sabir!

550
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:39,310
Yes, sir.

551
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:43,477
Michael and you can head home.

552
00:30:44,352 --> 00:30:46,685
Go celebrate my birthday with your family.

553
00:30:46,768 --> 00:30:48,768
Get a cake on the way, okay?

554
00:30:48,852 --> 00:30:50,352
I'll drive myself.

555
00:30:50,435 --> 00:30:52,310
-Happy birthday, sir.
-Thank you.

556
00:30:57,518 --> 00:30:59,185
I hope you remember the rules.

557
00:31:00,268 --> 00:31:04,602
The camera will be on at all times.
No police. No outsiders.

558
00:31:04,685 --> 00:31:07,727
And all calls on speakerphone.

559
00:31:14,185 --> 00:31:15,602
-Yeah, Harsh.
<i>-Where are you, AK?</i>

560
00:31:15,685 --> 00:31:16,893
Heading home, son.

561
00:31:17,518 --> 00:31:20,602
<i>Hurry up! Mom's getting</i>
<i>really pissed! We're all starving.</i>

562
00:31:20,685 --> 00:31:21,977
Stuck in traffic.

563
00:31:22,727 --> 00:31:24,518
<i>You were supposed to leave early.</i>

564
00:31:24,602 --> 00:31:27,352
I know, but… Listen,
do you know where Sonam is?

565
00:31:28,477 --> 00:31:29,518
<i>No clue.</i>

566
00:31:32,227 --> 00:31:34,768
Okay. Listen,
I forgot Sonam's driver's name.

567
00:31:34,852 --> 00:31:37,352
What is his name?

568
00:31:37,852 --> 00:31:39,643
<i>Kumar. Why?</i>

569
00:31:39,727 --> 00:31:41,852
Yeah. Can you send me his number, please?

570
00:31:42,768 --> 00:31:43,977
<i>Doesn't Michael have it?</i>

571
00:31:44,602 --> 00:31:48,602
Michael wasn't feeling well.
I sent him home.

572
00:31:49,518 --> 00:31:52,727
<i>-So you are driving yourself?</i>
-Yeah, I'm driving myself.

573
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:54,518
<i>AK, you suck at driving.</i>

574
00:31:55,810 --> 00:32:00,477
Yeah, I know. Just send me
Kumar's number, please.

575
00:32:01,185 --> 00:32:02,185
<i>But why?</i>

576
00:32:02,852 --> 00:32:05,352
Just send me or ask him to call me up.

577
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,602
<i>So ask Sonam for it.</i>

578
00:32:08,477 --> 00:32:10,602
Sonam is not picking up the phone.

579
00:32:11,977 --> 00:32:13,560
<i>But why do you want his number?</i>

580
00:32:13,643 --> 00:32:17,393
Because she's asked me
to go for a family event,

581
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:20,268
and I want to confirm the dates!

582
00:32:22,227 --> 00:32:25,727
<i>Okay. Sorry, calm down.</i>

583
00:32:26,227 --> 00:32:27,810
<i>Do you want him to call you?</i>

584
00:32:30,977 --> 00:32:32,518
Yes, Kumar?

585
00:32:32,602 --> 00:32:33,727
-Kumar…
<i>-Yes, sir.</i>

586
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:35,310
Where are you guys?

587
00:32:35,393 --> 00:32:36,893
<i>At Crescent Hotel.</i>

588
00:32:36,977 --> 00:32:38,393
What are you doing there?

589
00:32:38,477 --> 00:32:39,977
<i>I'm waiting for Sonam ma'am.</i>

590
00:32:40,768 --> 00:32:43,727
<i>She'd come here for an event.</i>
<i>She's still inside.</i>

591
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:45,060
Is she still inside?

592
00:32:45,143 --> 00:32:47,185
<i>-Yes, sir.</i>
-Okay.

593
00:32:47,268 --> 00:32:48,310
<i>Okay, sir.</i>

594
00:32:53,685 --> 00:32:55,060
Security check, please.

595
00:32:55,143 --> 00:32:56,185
Come on. Hurry up!

596
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:20,852
<i>Jhakaas!</i>

597
00:33:23,268 --> 00:33:25,268
-Hi!
-Hi!

598
00:33:25,352 --> 00:33:28,268
Has Sonam come on yet,
or is she backstage?

599
00:33:28,352 --> 00:33:30,018
I just wanted to give her a surprise.

600
00:33:30,102 --> 00:33:33,102
-She never showed up.
-What do you mean?

601
00:33:33,185 --> 00:33:35,435
-She never showed up, sir.
-She never showed up?

602
00:33:35,518 --> 00:33:37,768
No. She came,
did her rehearsal, and went back.

603
00:33:37,852 --> 00:33:39,768
She wasn't in for the show.
She checked out.

604
00:33:39,852 --> 00:33:41,143
She did her rehearsal, but…

605
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:43,977
Yeah. Some asshole picked up
her phone and said she's not there.

606
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,018
She's not coming.

607
00:33:45,102 --> 00:33:46,852
That's very much unlike her.

608
00:33:46,935 --> 00:33:48,935
If I can be of any help, you know?

609
00:33:50,352 --> 00:33:53,018
With all due respect, sir,
we wanted Sonam, not her father.

610
00:33:53,102 --> 00:33:55,352
Please, I'm really busy right now.

611
00:33:55,435 --> 00:33:57,435
Excuse me,
which event company do you work for?

612
00:33:57,518 --> 00:33:58,935
I really have to go. Excuse me.

613
00:33:59,018 --> 00:34:00,768
-Hello!
-Listen…

614
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:15,102
Good evening, sir.
Welcome to the Crescent.

615
00:34:15,185 --> 00:34:17,685
Good evening.
My daughter Sonam was here

616
00:34:17,768 --> 00:34:19,685
and she left some time back.

617
00:34:19,768 --> 00:34:22,018
Can I please check the CCTV footage?

618
00:34:22,102 --> 00:34:23,893
If you don't mind, can I have a look?

619
00:34:23,977 --> 00:34:27,018
I'm really sorry,
but without a police request, I can't…

620
00:34:27,102 --> 00:34:28,643
There's no need to involve the police.

621
00:34:28,727 --> 00:34:31,393
I'll just have a quick look.
I'll fast forward it.

622
00:34:31,477 --> 00:34:32,893
Sorry, but it isn't allowed.

623
00:34:32,977 --> 00:34:36,518
-And could you please request…
-It's okay. You're doing very well.

624
00:34:36,602 --> 00:34:38,310
Anurag, please.

625
00:34:39,643 --> 00:34:40,893
Sonam is my daughter.

626
00:34:40,977 --> 00:34:42,102
-Yes, sir.
-I'm her father.

627
00:34:42,185 --> 00:34:44,977
If you don't believe me,
you can ask anyone.

628
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:45,893
No, sir--

629
00:34:45,977 --> 00:34:48,560
I'll show you some Insta pictures
of me and Sonam.

630
00:34:48,643 --> 00:34:50,102
-Mr. Kapoor?
-Yeah.

631
00:34:50,185 --> 00:34:53,268
Hello. Welcome to the Crescent, Mumbai.
I'm the manager.

632
00:34:53,935 --> 00:34:55,060
How may I help you?

633
00:34:55,643 --> 00:34:56,810
Yes, please.

634
00:34:57,935 --> 00:34:59,018
Mathur? Where are you from?

635
00:34:59,102 --> 00:35:02,143
-Look, it's my birthday today.
-Happy birthday.

636
00:35:02,227 --> 00:35:04,185
-You know Sonam, don't you?
-Of course.

637
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:06,393
The thing is that we have a bet.

638
00:35:06,477 --> 00:35:07,477
Okay.

639
00:35:09,227 --> 00:35:10,477
For my birthday party…

640
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,602
-She reached late to my birthday party.
-Okay.

641
00:35:13,685 --> 00:35:17,227
I know she left late from here,
but I need the proof.

642
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:20,643
I need to check the CCTV footage
to know exactly when she left.

643
00:35:20,727 --> 00:35:24,227
I'm really sorry. We, at Crescent,
have a strict privacy policy…

644
00:35:24,977 --> 00:35:26,727
regarding the privacy of our guests.

645
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:27,852
But she's my daughter.

646
00:35:27,935 --> 00:35:32,018
Both of us know that,
but the camera doesn't.

647
00:35:32,102 --> 00:35:34,977
Forget the father,
we can't share it with anybody.

648
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,810
-It's my birthday--
-Happy birthday.

649
00:35:36,893 --> 00:35:38,727
How old are you now?

650
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:41,727
Shall I order a cake?
A drink or two?

651
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:43,477
But I can't share the CCTV footage.

652
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,393
-I'm sorry.
-What kind of manager are you?

653
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:46,602
Do something, please.

654
00:35:46,685 --> 00:35:49,185
There is a way.

655
00:35:49,268 --> 00:35:50,268
Okay, tell me.

656
00:35:50,352 --> 00:35:52,518
-But, sir--
-Don't worry, just tell me.

657
00:35:52,602 --> 00:35:53,643
Sir…

658
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,185
Say, <i>"Jhakaas!"</i>

659
00:36:01,685 --> 00:36:03,727
<i>Jhakaas!</i>

660
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:05,102
-Done?
-Yeah.

661
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:08,435
"The best place
for your Christmas dinner."

662
00:36:09,727 --> 00:36:12,977
"Great ambience, great staff,
super cocktails, great food."

663
00:36:14,352 --> 00:36:16,060
"Only at Crescent, Mumbai."

664
00:36:16,143 --> 00:36:18,643
"Hashtag, jhakaasXmas."

665
00:36:23,102 --> 00:36:24,393
Is there any other entrance?

666
00:36:24,477 --> 00:36:25,935
No, this is the only one.

667
00:36:26,977 --> 00:36:29,852
-Where do you guys enter and exit from?
-There's a staff exit.

668
00:36:29,935 --> 00:36:33,060
Then show me the staff exit's footage
for the last four hours.

669
00:36:42,102 --> 00:36:43,893
Slow.

670
00:36:44,643 --> 00:36:45,727
Rewind.

671
00:36:47,768 --> 00:36:48,768
Pause this.

672
00:36:50,227 --> 00:36:51,477
Now zoom in.

673
00:37:07,602 --> 00:37:08,560
Sir…

674
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,102
This is a kidnapping.

675
00:37:13,602 --> 00:37:14,977
Who are you calling?

676
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,977
I have to inform my manager.

677
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:20,310
What a shot. Anurag.

678
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:23,477
Isn't it amazing? Mind-blowing.

679
00:37:24,602 --> 00:37:27,727
-Doesn't this look like a real kidnapping?
-Yeah.

680
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:29,810
This is actually a rehearsal.

681
00:37:29,893 --> 00:37:32,185
This is a rehearsal
for the film we're making.

682
00:37:33,268 --> 00:37:36,893
Do you even watch movies
or just CCTV footage?

683
00:37:36,977 --> 00:37:40,310
The blood that you see here is fake.

684
00:37:41,143 --> 00:37:43,977
Look. This is fake, too.

685
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:48,518
Here, take your phone.

686
00:37:48,602 --> 00:37:51,310
I should call Sonam and tell her
she's done some amazing work.

687
00:37:51,393 --> 00:37:53,643
Sonam, I just saw the shot.

688
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,227
Yeah, terrific performance, Sonam.

689
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:58,852
No, genuinely. Terrific!

690
00:37:58,935 --> 00:38:01,810
Okay, taxi? Okay.

691
00:38:01,893 --> 00:38:03,393
Show me the taxi's shot.

692
00:38:04,768 --> 00:38:06,685
Show me the closeup of the taxi.

693
00:38:07,685 --> 00:38:09,727
Yes. Zoom in.

694
00:38:11,935 --> 00:38:13,393
Show me the driver.

695
00:38:14,185 --> 00:38:16,310
Get closer. Closer.

696
00:38:17,268 --> 00:38:18,435
Closer.

697
00:38:18,518 --> 00:38:21,018
Sonam, what a face!

698
00:38:21,102 --> 00:38:22,893
What casting Chhabra has done!

699
00:38:24,727 --> 00:38:26,518
Our film is a hit, boss.

700
00:38:27,477 --> 00:38:29,977
The driver's face is perfect, too.

701
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,977
We should cast him, shouldn't we?

702
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:33,352
Right?

703
00:38:33,893 --> 00:38:36,185
And don't tell anyone
about this rehearsal, okay?

704
00:38:36,268 --> 00:38:38,268
And keep this.

705
00:38:39,143 --> 00:38:41,435
-No, sir.
-Today is my birthday, I insist.

706
00:38:41,518 --> 00:38:42,435
Thank you.

707
00:38:42,518 --> 00:38:44,643
-Mathur, you're still here?
-Yes, sir.

708
00:38:44,727 --> 00:38:46,685
-Thank you for the help.
-You're welcome.

709
00:38:46,768 --> 00:38:48,018
-I'll never forget you.
-Yes.

710
00:38:48,102 --> 00:38:49,143
Mathur.

711
00:38:53,435 --> 00:38:54,393
Hello, baby.

712
00:38:54,477 --> 00:38:56,977
<i>Don't "Baby" me! Where the hell are you?</i>

713
00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:00,435
<i>We are celebrating your birthday,</i>
<i>and you are having dinner at the hotel!</i>

714
00:39:00,518 --> 00:39:04,310
<i>What is going on, Anil?</i>
<i>We've been waiting for hours!</i>

715
00:39:04,393 --> 00:39:09,352
<i>-And why are you doing a film…</i>
-Hello? Hello, baby?

716
00:39:09,435 --> 00:39:11,185
All calls on speakerphone.

717
00:39:11,268 --> 00:39:12,268
Okay, fine.

718
00:39:12,977 --> 00:39:14,602
Who is this taxi driver?

719
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:16,685
That's the film. Figure it out.

720
00:39:16,768 --> 00:39:20,560
Now, look, who's this?
Your son-in-law is calling.

721
00:39:20,643 --> 00:39:22,768
-Should I talk to him as Sonam?
-Fuck!

722
00:39:23,435 --> 00:39:24,602
I'll cut the call.

723
00:39:25,977 --> 00:39:28,185
Sorry, Boney, got late.

724
00:39:28,268 --> 00:39:29,560
I'm really sorry.

725
00:39:29,643 --> 00:39:31,435
You're always punctual.
What happened today?

726
00:39:31,518 --> 00:39:33,060
Sorry, I was at a rehearsal.

727
00:39:33,143 --> 00:39:34,935
I'm doing Anurag's film.

728
00:39:35,852 --> 00:39:38,143
Didn't do <i>Kalicharan</i>
and you're doing this.

729
00:39:38,227 --> 00:39:40,768
-Marc, have you met my brother?
-No, I haven't. Hello, Boney.

730
00:39:40,852 --> 00:39:42,685
-He's my trainer.
-Nice to meet you.

731
00:39:42,768 --> 00:39:43,893
His body is because of you?

732
00:39:43,977 --> 00:39:45,018
Where's everybody?

733
00:39:45,102 --> 00:39:47,810
How are you feeling
on a scale of one to ten for training?

734
00:39:47,893 --> 00:39:50,143
Zero. No training tonight. I'm tired.

735
00:39:50,227 --> 00:39:51,935
So where is everyone?

736
00:39:52,018 --> 00:39:53,727
Everybody was here.

737
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:56,602
There was Arjun, Karan,
Rhea, Janhvi, Khushi.

738
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:58,352
They waited for you to come.

739
00:39:58,435 --> 00:40:00,018
And finally they left.

740
00:40:00,102 --> 00:40:02,185
Now it's only Sonam,
I'm going to call her up.

741
00:40:02,268 --> 00:40:04,893
And Sonu is waiting for you upstairs.

742
00:40:04,977 --> 00:40:08,227
She is waiting for you
with a very special gift.

743
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:09,310
Please go up.

744
00:40:10,018 --> 00:40:11,102
Special gift.

745
00:40:11,685 --> 00:40:12,727
Go upstairs.

746
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:15,518
-We will take your leave now.
-No, sit.

747
00:40:15,602 --> 00:40:17,685
Have dinner and go. You are family.

748
00:40:23,268 --> 00:40:24,227
Babes.

749
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:26,560
Babes, I have come.

750
00:40:29,602 --> 00:40:30,643
I'm sorry.

751
00:40:32,227 --> 00:40:34,560
I'm sorry, babes. Now come out.

752
00:40:35,852 --> 00:40:39,518
Everybody's waiting, let's cut the cake.
Come fast.

753
00:40:39,602 --> 00:40:43,143
Hey, I'm seeing two AKs!

754
00:40:43,685 --> 00:40:45,060
Happy birthday, big boy.

755
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:49,435
The man I wanna see, Kashyap.

756
00:40:49,518 --> 00:40:51,560
How've you been, man?
It's good to see you.

757
00:40:52,393 --> 00:40:54,977
You know what?
I need to tell you something.

758
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:57,310
My family, they fucking hate you.

759
00:40:57,935 --> 00:40:59,560
But I fucking love you.

760
00:40:59,643 --> 00:41:02,060
Okay. You're the guy.

761
00:41:02,143 --> 00:41:03,477
Hi, I'm Harsh.

762
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:06,185
-Hi.
-My friends call me… Harsh.

763
00:41:07,393 --> 00:41:09,143
Come on, let's have dinner.

764
00:41:09,227 --> 00:41:12,768
Dad, this is a gift from me and the girls.

765
00:41:13,602 --> 00:41:17,852
It is a special edition Rolex,
and Sonam asked me to give it to you.

766
00:41:18,602 --> 00:41:20,810
Why do you keep on
getting me these expensive gifts?

767
00:41:20,893 --> 00:41:21,727
It's nothing.

768
00:41:22,435 --> 00:41:26,185
Thank you, son! Thanks so much.

769
00:41:26,268 --> 00:41:28,060
AK, I'm coming to you, man.

770
00:41:28,143 --> 00:41:29,602
You guys are making a movie?

771
00:41:29,685 --> 00:41:33,518
Listen, the point is that you and I
will make a great team.

772
00:41:33,602 --> 00:41:34,852
Out, out.

773
00:41:34,935 --> 00:41:37,227
-Boney, it's okay.
-No!

774
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:39,352
See, we are treating you as family.

775
00:41:39,435 --> 00:41:41,518
-I told you, he's going to get upset.
-Put it off!

776
00:41:41,602 --> 00:41:43,310
-He'll get angry.
-Put it off!

777
00:41:43,393 --> 00:41:45,977
-Put it off! Your film will be shelved.
-Sir?

778
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:47,643
Why are you asking him?

779
00:41:47,727 --> 00:41:49,810
He's not the boss. I'm the boss out here.

780
00:41:50,518 --> 00:41:51,518
Put it down.

781
00:41:52,018 --> 00:41:53,018
That's better.

782
00:41:53,102 --> 00:41:54,102
Sorry.

783
00:41:54,185 --> 00:41:57,518
Dad, let me know if you wanna
toss water on Anurag's face.

784
00:41:57,602 --> 00:41:58,643
My phone is ready.

785
00:41:58,727 --> 00:42:00,643
-What's wrong with you, Harsh?
-Sorry.

786
00:42:01,893 --> 00:42:04,727
What's happening, Anurag?
Jalal said you were making <i>Taken.</i>

787
00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:07,393
-No, I'm not making <i>Taken.</i>
-Then?

788
00:42:08,643 --> 00:42:10,977
It's about a film director.

789
00:42:11,893 --> 00:42:14,935
Like Guru Dutt? <i>Kaagaz Ke Phool?</i>

790
00:42:15,018 --> 00:42:17,768
Not like <i>Kaagaz Ke Phool</i>.
It's an original film.

791
00:42:17,852 --> 00:42:20,310
Like the film with
Angelina Jolie and Banderas?

792
00:42:20,393 --> 00:42:22,643
Not <i>Original Sin,</i> original film.
My own idea.

793
00:42:22,727 --> 00:42:24,435
Oh, wow, lovely.

794
00:42:24,518 --> 00:42:26,435
-How is everyone at home?
-All good.

795
00:42:26,518 --> 00:42:29,810
Aaliyah said your parents are in town
but that you never go home.

796
00:42:29,893 --> 00:42:31,518
Yeah, just busy with work.

797
00:42:31,602 --> 00:42:33,977
Dad, why are you texting me?
I'm right here.

798
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:36,060
What text did your dad send?

799
00:42:36,768 --> 00:42:38,185
"Help me find Sonam."

800
00:42:38,268 --> 00:42:39,768
What happened to Sonam?

801
00:42:39,852 --> 00:42:42,310
Nothing, we're just rehearsing.

802
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:44,560
I'm doing his arty film.

803
00:42:44,643 --> 00:42:47,768
So we have to rehearse all the time,
while sleeping, eating, drinking.

804
00:42:48,352 --> 00:42:49,685
Was this a rehearsal, too?

805
00:42:50,602 --> 00:42:52,435
-Show me.
-You punching him.

806
00:42:52,518 --> 00:42:53,518
Yes, it was a rehearsal.

807
00:42:53,602 --> 00:42:56,185
-At the police station?
-It was a police station setup.

808
00:42:56,268 --> 00:42:59,268
Yes, we were just rehearsing.
Can we rehearse now?

809
00:42:59,352 --> 00:43:01,643
-Sure, let's do it.
-We still have a couple of scenes.

810
00:43:01,727 --> 00:43:03,060
No need to rehearse so much.

811
00:43:03,143 --> 00:43:04,185
Let's go.

812
00:43:04,268 --> 00:43:07,602
All this rehearsing,
and you still don't have a hit, Anurag.

813
00:43:07,685 --> 00:43:08,560
Anil?

814
00:43:08,643 --> 00:43:10,477
We'll be back soon. You all finish.

815
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,018
We're here for your birthday.

816
00:43:12,768 --> 00:43:14,352
Why did you text Harsh?

817
00:43:15,143 --> 00:43:17,810
I am asking you a question.
Why did you text Harsh?

818
00:43:18,893 --> 00:43:20,560
You think I was kidding?

819
00:43:21,518 --> 00:43:24,352
When I said no outsiders,
I meant no outsiders.

820
00:43:27,018 --> 00:43:28,435
Now tell me, where is Sonam?

821
00:43:29,477 --> 00:43:30,643
Fucking asshole.

822
00:43:31,768 --> 00:43:34,685
You shouldn't be in this industry
but in a mental asylum.

823
00:43:34,768 --> 00:43:38,102
This industry is a mental asylum.

824
00:43:38,185 --> 00:43:40,977
-Shoot me.
-I will shoot, Anurag.

825
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:43,560
I won't hesitate to shoot.

826
00:43:43,643 --> 00:43:46,143
So shoot me.
You'll still have to find Sonam.

827
00:43:46,227 --> 00:43:48,143
Does this antique even work?

828
00:43:48,227 --> 00:43:50,977
Yes, it does, Anurag.
This antique does work.

829
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:53,102
Tell me, where is Sonam?

830
00:43:53,185 --> 00:43:55,643
Do I look like I give a fuck?

831
00:43:56,685 --> 00:43:59,477
Cinema is my only religion.
I will live and die for it.

832
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,602
Fuck you and your cinema!

833
00:44:01,685 --> 00:44:02,852
Just shoot me.

834
00:44:02,935 --> 00:44:05,935
This video will go viral
and make millions on YouTube.

835
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:09,185
Aaliyah will be taken care of forever,
and I will become a legend.

836
00:44:09,268 --> 00:44:11,352
So, shoot me. You still won't find Sonam.

837
00:44:13,393 --> 00:44:15,643
Dad! Let me in.

838
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:17,310
Let me in!

839
00:44:17,393 --> 00:44:18,518
Make him leave.

840
00:44:19,518 --> 00:44:21,310
We're just rehearsing.

841
00:44:21,393 --> 00:44:23,143
Just give us two minutes.

842
00:44:23,227 --> 00:44:25,560
I want to talk to Anurag
about the rehearsals.

843
00:44:25,643 --> 00:44:27,102
Just two minutes.

844
00:44:27,643 --> 00:44:30,310
Not two minutes. Make him leave.

845
00:44:30,393 --> 00:44:32,560
Or I'll call Sonam's hotline.

846
00:44:32,643 --> 00:44:35,060
I hope you remember Master

847
00:44:35,727 --> 00:44:37,602
and what he was holding.

848
00:44:43,393 --> 00:44:44,393
Look, Anurag,

849
00:44:45,727 --> 00:44:47,102
you don't know him.

850
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:50,018
He's like Sherlock Holmes.

851
00:44:50,102 --> 00:44:53,477
I don't care if he's Sherlock Holmes
or Byomkesh Bakshi.

852
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:56,435
You should. He can do anything.

853
00:44:56,518 --> 00:44:58,310
He is fucking mad.

854
00:44:58,393 --> 00:45:01,060
I can do anything, too. I am mad, too.

855
00:45:01,143 --> 00:45:02,685
He's my son. I know him.

856
00:45:02,768 --> 00:45:05,268
He better leave in two minutes.
The video is live.

857
00:45:05,352 --> 00:45:07,560
And Master has a weapon in his hand.

858
00:45:07,643 --> 00:45:10,393
Sonam will scream.
Choose between your son and daughter.

859
00:45:14,893 --> 00:45:17,393
There is no time.
The clock is ticking.

860
00:45:22,185 --> 00:45:23,102
Come in.

861
00:45:23,727 --> 00:45:26,435
-I just need to talk to Kashyap.
-Come, talk to him.

862
00:45:26,518 --> 00:45:29,643
Anurag! It's the man
I've been looking for.

863
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,852
I know what the two of you are doing.

864
00:45:31,935 --> 00:45:33,435
You're making a movie.

865
00:45:33,518 --> 00:45:35,143
Sonam has been kidnapped
in this movie,

866
00:45:35,227 --> 00:45:38,852
and you're thinking <i>I…</i>
can help you find her, right?

867
00:45:40,727 --> 00:45:43,268
You're abso-fucking-lutely right!

868
00:45:43,352 --> 00:45:45,102
I can be his assistant in this movie.

869
00:45:45,185 --> 00:45:46,935
The tech geek. Interior. Day. House.

870
00:45:47,018 --> 00:45:49,102
Harsh sits on his computer.
He's banging on keys.

871
00:45:49,185 --> 00:45:52,060
He's plotting locations.
He's going to take Anil to Sonam.

872
00:45:52,768 --> 00:45:54,352
What do you think? Ideas?

873
00:45:55,102 --> 00:45:56,393
You're running out of time.

874
00:45:56,477 --> 00:45:57,310
Fuck!

875
00:45:57,893 --> 00:45:59,935
Fantastic, Anurag! I love that!

876
00:46:00,018 --> 00:46:01,393
You should have done <i>Kalicharan!</i>

877
00:46:01,477 --> 00:46:04,060
This winter, think fucking neon!

878
00:46:04,143 --> 00:46:05,768
Anurag Kashyap's in the house!

879
00:46:05,852 --> 00:46:07,185
I love that added drama of time.

880
00:46:07,268 --> 00:46:09,018
Gets the viewers' hearts pumping.

881
00:46:09,102 --> 00:46:10,518
Like, "There's 60 seconds left."

882
00:46:10,602 --> 00:46:12,268
Electronic music picks up.

883
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:14,852
"If I don't help Dad
with the fucking coordinates,

884
00:46:14,935 --> 00:46:17,602
Sonam will… die."

885
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:22,685
Forty-five seconds left, man,
when the car we're travelling in

886
00:46:22,768 --> 00:46:24,810
-is hit by the bad guys, Kashyap.
-Fuck.

887
00:46:24,893 --> 00:46:29,268
It rolls over one, two, three, four
fucking times, it lands upside down!

888
00:46:30,268 --> 00:46:34,227
There's 30 seconds left.

889
00:46:34,310 --> 00:46:36,518
Everybody is fucking bugging out, man.

890
00:46:36,602 --> 00:46:39,560
The satellite
has locked on to the location.

891
00:46:39,643 --> 00:46:41,518
It's flashing on the computer screen.

892
00:46:41,602 --> 00:46:43,268
Good, Harsh.

893
00:46:43,352 --> 00:46:44,435
Good!

894
00:46:44,518 --> 00:46:46,143
All I need to do is press "enter."

895
00:46:46,768 --> 00:46:48,268
Harsh, you're doing well.

896
00:46:48,352 --> 00:46:50,518
But… there is a twist.

897
00:46:50,602 --> 00:46:54,102
Because Anurag-fucking-Kashyap
doesn't make straight fucking films, man!

898
00:46:54,185 --> 00:46:57,435
This is some gray fucking shit!
It's deep gray, man!

899
00:46:57,518 --> 00:47:00,768
The fucking computer
is stuck under the back seat!

900
00:47:00,852 --> 00:47:04,893
There's 20 seconds left, AK.
There's 20 seconds fucking left.

901
00:47:04,977 --> 00:47:08,560
Michael Bay meets Anurag-fucking-Kashyap,
Tony Montana. He's got a gun!

902
00:47:08,643 --> 00:47:11,727
There's a hundred of him, on cocaine!
He's firing fucking bullets.

903
00:47:11,810 --> 00:47:15,727
One shatters into my knee bone, man.
The fucking pain! Fuck!

904
00:47:15,810 --> 00:47:18,268
It races through my fucking body.
It's unbearable!

905
00:47:18,352 --> 00:47:20,560
But I'm a dedicated son and brother, man.

906
00:47:20,643 --> 00:47:23,685
So I fucking leap! Like a cheetah!

907
00:47:23,768 --> 00:47:27,102
I fucking get two hands
on the fucking screen, man.

908
00:47:27,185 --> 00:47:28,477
The fucking button is there.

909
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:31,227
It's begging to be fucking pressed.

910
00:47:32,935 --> 00:47:36,227
Will I press the fucking button, man?

911
00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:37,518
Do it.

912
00:47:37,602 --> 00:47:39,018
No!

913
00:47:39,768 --> 00:47:41,768
I mean, go, Harsh!

914
00:47:41,852 --> 00:47:44,852
-Motwane fucked me with <i>Bhavesh.</i>
-He will fucking…

915
00:47:44,935 --> 00:47:47,060
-Kashyap, you're gonna bring me back!
-Go!

916
00:47:47,143 --> 00:47:49,227
Redemption!

917
00:47:49,310 --> 00:47:51,518
<i>Bhavesh Joshi 2, </i>directed by
Anurag-fucking-Kashyap!

918
00:47:51,602 --> 00:47:52,935
We are working.

919
00:47:53,018 --> 00:47:54,602
Let us focus on our scene, Harsh.

920
00:47:54,685 --> 00:47:58,602
Sonam's finger is gone.

921
00:47:59,352 --> 00:48:00,393
Fucking asshole!

922
00:48:02,102 --> 00:48:04,018
What did you do?

923
00:48:04,102 --> 00:48:05,727
What the fuck did you do?

924
00:48:06,268 --> 00:48:09,310
Motherfucker, get up!

925
00:48:11,018 --> 00:48:12,060
Fuck.

926
00:48:20,768 --> 00:48:21,685
Motherfucker!

927
00:48:34,227 --> 00:48:35,060
Asshole!

928
00:48:56,935 --> 00:48:59,477
You call yourself a legend?

929
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:02,518
You think you're a legend?

930
00:49:06,893 --> 00:49:08,768
Sir, they're calling you for dinner.

931
00:49:14,102 --> 00:49:16,935
What are you looking at?
Go and get us two drinks!

932
00:49:28,810 --> 00:49:32,060
Tell me where Sonam is!

933
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:06,560
Get up!

934
00:50:18,768 --> 00:50:19,935
Why are you laughing?

935
00:50:28,268 --> 00:50:32,560
An iconic hero
can't find his own daughter.

936
00:50:33,435 --> 00:50:34,935
Your era is over.

937
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:37,185
You're no hero.

938
00:50:38,185 --> 00:50:39,560
What are you trying to say?

939
00:50:41,935 --> 00:50:43,310
That I'm a fool?

940
00:50:44,643 --> 00:50:46,768
And you're a great, genius filmmaker?

941
00:50:48,893 --> 00:50:50,060
Dumbfuck.

942
00:50:50,602 --> 00:50:54,310
You are not even good enough
to be Martin Scorsese's fucking toenail!

943
00:50:56,893 --> 00:50:59,102
What do you want? Consider it given.

944
00:51:00,435 --> 00:51:01,310
You win.

945
00:51:03,185 --> 00:51:04,060
Tell me.

946
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:05,935
Come on.

947
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:10,185
Talk, motherfucker, talk!

948
00:51:11,393 --> 00:51:12,685
-Yogita.
-Yeah?

949
00:51:12,768 --> 00:51:14,060
Yogita, come here.

950
00:51:14,935 --> 00:51:15,977
Sir…

951
00:51:16,935 --> 00:51:19,810
you have to talk.

952
00:51:21,893 --> 00:51:23,935
I'm just behind the camera.

953
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:26,935
You are the hero of the film.

954
00:51:27,518 --> 00:51:29,185
This is your big comeback.

955
00:51:29,977 --> 00:51:31,685
<i>The Hero Returns.</i>

956
00:51:32,602 --> 00:51:35,352
You have to prove to the world

957
00:51:35,435 --> 00:51:38,518
that "forever young"
Anil Kapoor still has his mojo

958
00:51:38,602 --> 00:51:43,143
and can find Sonam Kapoor before sunrise.

959
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:47,643
Come on, sir. Action.

960
00:51:49,185 --> 00:51:50,227
Get lost, motherfucker!

961
00:51:50,310 --> 00:51:54,685
<i>Happy birthday to you!</i>

962
00:51:56,268 --> 00:51:57,685
What happened to your face?

963
00:51:57,768 --> 00:51:59,810
-Did Boney leave?
-Yeah, he left.

964
00:52:02,143 --> 00:52:04,310
Dad, you don't wanna cut the cake?

965
00:52:04,393 --> 00:52:06,102
AK! Where you going?

966
00:52:06,185 --> 00:52:12,268
Just seven hours to go.
Once again, the hero is needed.

967
00:52:14,893 --> 00:52:17,560
Hey, man, do you know him?

968
00:52:19,768 --> 00:52:22,393
Yes, motherfucker,
it's my left testicle. I massage it daily.

969
00:52:22,477 --> 00:52:24,143
At least look at it!

970
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:31,268
Oh, sorry, sir.
I called him a motherfucker, not you.

971
00:52:32,977 --> 00:52:34,185
Who is he?

972
00:52:34,935 --> 00:52:36,560
A taxi driver, can't you see?

973
00:52:37,310 --> 00:52:40,310
Sir, there are 30,000 taxis in this city.

974
00:52:40,393 --> 00:52:42,518
And two drivers
alternating shifts for each.

975
00:52:42,602 --> 00:52:45,477
And Ola and Uber have
fucked us in the ass!

976
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:47,352
Just answer my questions, please!

977
00:52:47,435 --> 00:52:48,685
Do you know him?

978
00:52:49,685 --> 00:52:51,852
There are
millions of drivers in Mumbai.

979
00:52:51,935 --> 00:52:55,227
If I recognized every one of them,
I would be heading the taxi union.

980
00:52:55,310 --> 00:52:58,602
But, sir, my family didn't even have
a place to get a night's honest sleep.

981
00:52:58,685 --> 00:53:01,477
I'll give you Anees Bazmee's number.
Go recite your lines to him.

982
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:03,560
Just answer my question. Do you know him?

983
00:53:04,393 --> 00:53:07,060
I'm a huge fan of Anees Bazmee.

984
00:53:07,143 --> 00:53:10,060
Please, give me his number.
I'll try my luck in movies.

985
00:53:10,143 --> 00:53:13,227
I write in my spare time.
I can narrate my script to you.

986
00:53:13,310 --> 00:53:15,185
Sir!

987
00:53:15,268 --> 00:53:17,185
Do check out Bandra Talao.

988
00:53:17,268 --> 00:53:19,185
All the drivers there know each other.

989
00:53:19,268 --> 00:53:20,893
Bazmee's number, sir!

990
00:53:20,977 --> 00:53:23,893
<i>-Hello?</i>
-Yes, Anand, I was just going to call you.

991
00:53:23,977 --> 00:53:26,102
I'm sorry, I was going
to call you and your call came.

992
00:53:26,185 --> 00:53:28,352
<i>AK, Sonam's driver is saying</i>
<i>she's at the Crescent.</i>

993
00:53:28,435 --> 00:53:31,518
<i>The Crescent says she's not there.</i>
<i>I know you were there looking for her.</i>

994
00:53:31,602 --> 00:53:33,643
<i>Where is she? Something is really off!</i>

995
00:53:33,727 --> 00:53:37,185
Off is Sonam's phone. I'm on.

996
00:53:37,268 --> 00:53:38,643
I just spoke to her, son.

997
00:53:39,143 --> 00:53:40,060
<i>Is she okay?</i>

998
00:53:40,643 --> 00:53:42,852
She's absolutely fine, son.

999
00:53:43,768 --> 00:53:46,810
You know, her battery went dead, so…

1000
00:53:46,893 --> 00:53:48,852
You know, as usual,
she forgot her charger.

1001
00:53:48,935 --> 00:53:52,060
She called me up from
someone else's phone just now.

1002
00:53:52,143 --> 00:53:54,268
-She just called me.
<i>-From whose phone?</i>

1003
00:53:54,352 --> 00:53:55,768
That's not the point.

1004
00:53:55,852 --> 00:53:57,060
<i>Then what's the point?</i>

1005
00:53:58,768 --> 00:54:01,768
The point is that she's given
a surprise party for me.

1006
00:54:01,852 --> 00:54:03,060
So I'm just going there, son.

1007
00:54:03,685 --> 00:54:04,935
<i>But where are you going?</i>

1008
00:54:05,935 --> 00:54:09,143
It's a surprise, son.
How can I tell you? It's a top secret.

1009
00:54:09,227 --> 00:54:10,977
She told me not to tell you, son.

1010
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:13,435
<i>AK, if it's a secret,</i>
<i>how do you know where to go?</i>

1011
00:54:14,393 --> 00:54:17,518
<i>Nothing you're saying is making any sense.</i>
<i>I'm really worried.</i>

1012
00:54:17,602 --> 00:54:20,560
<i>Call me when you're with her.</i>
<i>Otherwise, I'm going to the cops.</i>

1013
00:54:22,435 --> 00:54:24,102
<i>Hello? AK?</i>

1014
00:54:25,310 --> 00:54:27,810
Fuck!

1015
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:32,893
Brother, do you know him?

1016
00:54:35,352 --> 00:54:37,477
Uncle, you?

1017
00:54:39,310 --> 00:54:40,143
No.

1018
00:54:40,227 --> 00:54:41,518
Do you recognize him?

1019
00:54:42,602 --> 00:54:43,685
Have you seen him?

1020
00:54:44,435 --> 00:54:45,518
Do you recognize him?

1021
00:54:46,268 --> 00:54:47,393
A selfie, please?

1022
00:54:48,310 --> 00:54:49,227
Do you know him?

1023
00:54:51,102 --> 00:54:53,727
Do you know him? Come, look here.

1024
00:54:53,810 --> 00:54:56,102
Come closer and look.
Can you even see from back there?

1025
00:54:56,185 --> 00:54:57,352
Come closer. Do you know him?

1026
00:55:04,018 --> 00:55:06,060
Brothers, do you recognize him?

1027
00:55:06,643 --> 00:55:08,602
Are there any other taxi stands here?

1028
00:55:08,685 --> 00:55:09,768
Any big taxi stand around?

1029
00:55:14,768 --> 00:55:15,727
Do you recognize him?

1030
00:55:16,727 --> 00:55:17,727
Do you know him?

1031
00:55:44,810 --> 00:55:47,977
-Anil sir, this guy…
-Yes.

1032
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:52,352
I have definitely seen him.

1033
00:55:52,435 --> 00:55:54,310
Believe me. I swear.

1034
00:55:54,393 --> 00:55:57,143
-These taxi drivers have a group.
-Okay.

1035
00:55:57,227 --> 00:56:01,893
I swear to God,
all these taxi drivers know each other.

1036
00:56:01,977 --> 00:56:04,477
-Okay. Thank you.
-What else is up, brother?

1037
00:57:15,185 --> 00:57:16,935
-Tell me, sir.
-Do you know him?

1038
00:57:22,810 --> 00:57:24,060
Have you seen him around?

1039
00:57:33,310 --> 00:57:34,310
Do you know him?

1040
00:57:39,268 --> 00:57:42,227
There's Uncle Rahim's taxi
down the road, he can tell you.

1041
00:57:42,310 --> 00:57:43,852
That's Uncle Rahim's taxi.

1042
00:57:48,977 --> 00:57:50,310
-Where?
-A little further!

1043
00:58:02,102 --> 00:58:04,727
Uncle Rahim?

1044
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:07,560
Do you know him?

1045
00:58:09,018 --> 00:58:10,477
-Do you know him?
-Yes.

1046
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:11,393
Who is he?

1047
00:58:12,227 --> 00:58:13,768
Can you take me to him? Please.

1048
00:58:14,685 --> 00:58:16,977
Where does he stay?
Please, take me… Uncle Rahim.

1049
00:58:18,685 --> 00:58:20,560
I'm ready to give you whatever you want.

1050
00:58:21,227 --> 00:58:22,185
Money?

1051
00:58:22,935 --> 00:58:24,060
You name it.

1052
00:58:38,227 --> 00:58:39,727
Do you want to meet Javed or not?

1053
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:51,935
Now please tell me where he lives.

1054
00:58:55,477 --> 00:58:56,810
What's happening here?

1055
00:58:56,893 --> 00:58:58,185
Christmas celebrations.

1056
00:58:59,393 --> 00:59:01,518
-Does Javed celebrate Christmas?
-Yes.

1057
00:59:02,268 --> 00:59:03,643
But how do I find him here?

1058
00:59:14,852 --> 00:59:15,977
Please, make way.

1059
01:00:27,310 --> 01:00:28,893
-Sir, I'm shooting.
-Give me the camera.

1060
01:00:29,393 --> 01:00:35,227
…the biggest superstar of India,
Anil Kapoor!

1061
01:00:35,935 --> 01:00:38,977
Let's hear it for him!

1062
01:00:44,977 --> 01:00:45,810
Javed!

1063
01:00:46,518 --> 01:00:47,352
Javed!

1064
01:00:47,852 --> 01:00:50,143
Yogita, take the camera. Take the camera.

1065
01:00:57,643 --> 01:00:59,102
Let us pass, please.

1066
01:01:00,727 --> 01:01:02,143
Anil sir!

1067
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:04,810
Merry Christmas!

1068
01:01:06,227 --> 01:01:07,560
Let me go! Move!

1069
01:01:10,352 --> 01:01:12,143
Move aside, please!

1070
01:01:12,227 --> 01:01:13,310
Give way!

1071
01:01:27,185 --> 01:01:28,018
Javed!

1072
01:01:29,935 --> 01:01:31,768
Javed, stop! Javed!

1073
01:01:34,602 --> 01:01:35,435
Javed!

1074
01:01:36,685 --> 01:01:37,518
Shit!

1075
01:01:40,185 --> 01:01:41,602
Javed, listen to me. Javed!

1076
01:01:45,185 --> 01:01:46,018
Stop, Javed!

1077
01:01:53,227 --> 01:01:54,060
Javed!

1078
01:01:55,185 --> 01:01:56,018
Javed!

1079
01:01:56,643 --> 01:01:58,810
Javed, listen to me. Javed! Stop, Javed!

1080
01:02:09,893 --> 01:02:10,893
Javed, stop!

1081
01:02:13,102 --> 01:02:13,935
Javed!

1082
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:30,977
Javed!

1083
01:02:32,185 --> 01:02:33,227
Listen to me, Javed!

1084
01:02:35,893 --> 01:02:36,727
Javed!

1085
01:02:44,268 --> 01:02:45,685
Javed! Where is my daughter?

1086
01:02:45,768 --> 01:02:46,893
I didn't do anything!

1087
01:02:51,518 --> 01:02:52,352
Javed!

1088
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:54,477
Don't hit me! I haven't done anything!

1089
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:56,227
Where is my daughter, Javed?

1090
01:02:56,310 --> 01:02:57,227
I don't know anything!

1091
01:03:01,018 --> 01:03:02,018
Javed, stop!

1092
01:03:03,727 --> 01:03:04,685
Anurag sir!

1093
01:03:05,810 --> 01:03:06,643
Javed!

1094
01:03:09,268 --> 01:03:10,102
Javed!

1095
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:13,393
Javed!

1096
01:03:15,393 --> 01:03:16,227
Javed, stop!

1097
01:03:17,268 --> 01:03:18,102
Shit!

1098
01:03:25,643 --> 01:03:26,477
Javed!

1099
01:03:27,935 --> 01:03:29,060
Javed, look, listen to me.

1100
01:03:29,685 --> 01:03:31,393
Why are you following me?

1101
01:03:31,477 --> 01:03:33,560
I'll get you a new taxi.

1102
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:35,643
Can you bring him closer to me, please?

1103
01:03:35,727 --> 01:03:37,935
-Bring him closer please.
-Don't you move!

1104
01:03:38,018 --> 01:03:39,393
This is not my fault.

1105
01:03:40,018 --> 01:03:41,685
-Sir!
-Javed.

1106
01:03:43,685 --> 01:03:44,560
Javed.

1107
01:03:46,518 --> 01:03:47,518
Get away from me!

1108
01:03:53,852 --> 01:03:54,685
Javed, stop!

1109
01:03:56,852 --> 01:03:58,643
Tell me!

1110
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:00,393
Where's Sonam?

1111
01:04:00,477 --> 01:04:01,310
Leave me!

1112
01:04:03,310 --> 01:04:04,435
Tell me where Sonam is.

1113
01:04:07,227 --> 01:04:08,393
Wait, Javed!

1114
01:04:10,602 --> 01:04:11,518
Javed, stop!

1115
01:04:12,768 --> 01:04:13,810
Javed, stop!

1116
01:04:14,435 --> 01:04:15,310
Oh, fuck!

1117
01:04:24,935 --> 01:04:25,768
Anil sir?

1118
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:28,602
Are you okay?

1119
01:04:31,727 --> 01:04:32,977
Are you all right?

1120
01:04:36,060 --> 01:04:36,893
Sir…

1121
01:04:38,185 --> 01:04:39,227
Are you okay?

1122
01:04:47,768 --> 01:04:49,143
Are you all right?

1123
01:04:54,352 --> 01:04:55,685
Are you all right?

1124
01:04:59,852 --> 01:05:01,143
Are you okay?

1125
01:05:02,435 --> 01:05:03,518
Are you okay?

1126
01:05:06,227 --> 01:05:07,935
Do I look okay to you?

1127
01:05:11,477 --> 01:05:14,477
Has staying with that asshole
turned you completely blind?

1128
01:05:17,643 --> 01:05:18,685
What's okay?

1129
01:05:23,685 --> 01:05:24,852
Is my face okay?

1130
01:05:27,185 --> 01:05:29,435
My arms, my legs…

1131
01:05:30,227 --> 01:05:32,352
Are my clothes okay?

1132
01:05:36,018 --> 01:05:37,060
Fucking Anil Kapoor…

1133
01:05:40,268 --> 01:05:44,102
is lying in the street
outside the Grant Road station.

1134
01:05:46,977 --> 01:05:49,560
Balls to Anil Kapoor! Motherfucker!

1135
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:54,602
Fucking failure.

1136
01:05:55,185 --> 01:05:56,227
I'm a failure.

1137
01:06:05,977 --> 01:06:11,727
You know, in 1986,
I gave 13 superhit films back-to-back.

1138
01:06:13,268 --> 01:06:14,435
Sonam was one year old.

1139
01:06:16,977 --> 01:06:17,893
Her birthday…

1140
01:06:20,185 --> 01:06:22,227
Do you know
what I was doing on her birthday?

1141
01:06:22,310 --> 01:06:23,227
I was shooting.

1142
01:06:24,060 --> 01:06:25,018
Double shift.

1143
01:06:26,143 --> 01:06:27,393
What kind of father does that?

1144
01:06:28,685 --> 01:06:31,685
And this director of yours, Anurag…

1145
01:06:33,435 --> 01:06:36,185
I was the one who took him
to Shankar, the director of <i>Nayak.</i>

1146
01:06:37,852 --> 01:06:40,977
I told him, "This boy is talented,
give him work, let him write dialogues."

1147
01:06:42,935 --> 01:06:45,227
I gave the first clap for his first film.

1148
01:06:45,893 --> 01:06:48,518
I gave him his first installment
for his first house.

1149
01:06:49,435 --> 01:06:51,352
And what does he do?

1150
01:06:52,185 --> 01:06:54,018
He kidnaps my daughter.

1151
01:06:55,977 --> 01:06:57,977
Shame on such a father…

1152
01:06:59,727 --> 01:07:02,560
because of whom
his daughter got kidnapped.

1153
01:07:07,768 --> 01:07:09,143
I miss her.

1154
01:07:12,393 --> 01:07:13,227
Listen.

1155
01:07:13,810 --> 01:07:16,352
Do you know where my Sonam is?

1156
01:07:18,310 --> 01:07:20,393
What do you want?
I'll give you whatever it is.

1157
01:07:20,477 --> 01:07:21,477
Do you want my car?

1158
01:07:23,060 --> 01:07:25,185
You want a house, right?
I'll give it to you.

1159
01:07:25,810 --> 01:07:27,227
Just tell me what you want.

1160
01:07:27,810 --> 01:07:29,227
Anil Kapoor will give it to you.

1161
01:07:29,310 --> 01:07:31,768
You want to be a filmmaker, right?

1162
01:07:31,852 --> 01:07:33,060
I'll produce your film.

1163
01:07:33,977 --> 01:07:37,935
Sonam will act in your film.
I'll play her father's role.

1164
01:07:38,435 --> 01:07:39,310
Promise.

1165
01:07:41,268 --> 01:07:46,685
But… please,
just tell me where my daughter is.

1166
01:07:47,852 --> 01:07:49,935
I beg you, tell me where my daughter is.

1167
01:07:51,393 --> 01:07:54,477
Please, tell me where my daughter…

1168
01:08:05,102 --> 01:08:06,143
What happened?

1169
01:08:07,268 --> 01:08:08,185
Sir, he--

1170
01:08:08,268 --> 01:08:10,268
-What happened?
-He got hit by a car.

1171
01:08:11,768 --> 01:08:13,268
Did you get the shot?

1172
01:08:13,352 --> 01:08:14,435
Yeah, it was superb.

1173
01:08:17,602 --> 01:08:19,060
This is so fucking real, man.

1174
01:08:19,768 --> 01:08:21,393
This is so real.

1175
01:08:22,685 --> 01:08:24,977
That's so Daniel Day-Lewis.

1176
01:08:25,060 --> 01:08:27,602
There <i>is</i> blood!

1177
01:08:29,102 --> 01:08:30,893
Oscar, sir! Come on, get up!

1178
01:08:31,935 --> 01:08:32,768
Yeah.

1179
01:08:35,227 --> 01:08:36,768
No violence.

1180
01:09:00,810 --> 01:09:01,810
Mic, mic.

1181
01:09:01,893 --> 01:09:03,060
<i>Jhakaas!</i>

1182
01:09:05,602 --> 01:09:06,685
<i>Jhakaas!</i>

1183
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:10,977
Absolutely <i>jhakaas!</i>

1184
01:09:12,768 --> 01:09:13,977
Applause for them!

1185
01:09:18,143 --> 01:09:21,018
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

1186
01:09:25,185 --> 01:09:26,143
Hello.

1187
01:09:29,185 --> 01:09:31,602
As an actor, I have entertained you.

1188
01:09:34,727 --> 01:09:37,852
I have danced, sung,
made you laugh, made you cry.

1189
01:09:41,143 --> 01:09:43,727
I don't know if you like my acting or not.

1190
01:09:46,685 --> 01:09:47,560
Love you!

1191
01:09:48,185 --> 01:09:49,602
Thank you.

1192
01:09:49,685 --> 01:09:51,935
Today, at least someone's
telling me that they love me.

1193
01:09:55,685 --> 01:09:58,560
Look, I'm sorry
for ruining your Christmas party.

1194
01:09:58,643 --> 01:09:59,852
It's a happy day for you all.

1195
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:03,102
But for me,
this is a very sad day of my life.

1196
01:10:07,685 --> 01:10:08,518
But…

1197
01:10:09,352 --> 01:10:11,727
no one can help me, except you.

1198
01:10:15,643 --> 01:10:16,810
Amongst you…

1199
01:10:18,727 --> 01:10:20,060
is a friend of yours…

1200
01:10:21,185 --> 01:10:22,685
who lives around here.

1201
01:10:22,768 --> 01:10:24,893
He's a taxi driver. His name is Javed.

1202
01:10:25,810 --> 01:10:27,935
If you can tell me where he is…

1203
01:10:28,435 --> 01:10:30,185
He lives around here.

1204
01:10:30,268 --> 01:10:33,518
If you could take me to his house,
I'll be forever grateful.

1205
01:10:33,602 --> 01:10:38,643
I beg of you,
please tell me where Javed is.

1206
01:10:38,727 --> 01:10:41,435
I beg of you,
please, tell me where Javed is.

1207
01:10:41,518 --> 01:10:42,643
Dance!

1208
01:10:42,727 --> 01:10:46,685
Dance!

1209
01:10:53,852 --> 01:10:57,227
Play a song! Play it.

1210
01:10:57,310 --> 01:10:58,143
Here.

1211
01:10:58,852 --> 01:10:59,685
Play it.

1212
01:12:29,893 --> 01:12:32,935
-This one?
-Yes.

1213
01:12:37,643 --> 01:12:38,935
-Javed?
-Yeah?

1214
01:12:40,227 --> 01:12:42,018
Have a long-distance customer for you.
Open!

1215
01:12:42,977 --> 01:12:44,518
Why are you calling me?

1216
01:12:44,602 --> 01:12:48,018
My taxi has broken down… Motherfucker!

1217
01:12:51,060 --> 01:12:52,560
Anil sir!

1218
01:12:53,518 --> 01:12:55,602
Tell me! Where is Sonam?

1219
01:12:56,227 --> 01:12:57,727
I'm sorry! I made a mistake!

1220
01:13:01,977 --> 01:13:05,018
-I'll tell you!
-Tell me!

1221
01:13:05,102 --> 01:13:07,643
I'll take you there, Anil sir.

1222
01:13:07,727 --> 01:13:10,268
I swear! I will take you there.

1223
01:13:11,352 --> 01:13:12,393
Let's go.

1224
01:13:13,852 --> 01:13:15,477
Move!

1225
01:13:17,435 --> 01:13:18,477
Move!

1226
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:20,185
And cut!

1227
01:13:22,268 --> 01:13:23,977
Why were you running?

1228
01:13:24,060 --> 01:13:25,893
This guy told me to run.

1229
01:13:25,977 --> 01:13:27,935
Who were the other men with you?

1230
01:13:28,018 --> 01:13:29,227
I don't know.

1231
01:13:29,310 --> 01:13:32,352
They said I'd get money.
I just did what they told me to.

1232
01:13:32,435 --> 01:13:36,477
They told me to look into the CCTV camera
and to drive them.

1233
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:37,977
And drop Sonam at someone's house.

1234
01:13:38,060 --> 01:13:39,185
Which house?

1235
01:13:39,268 --> 01:13:40,643
Right from here.

1236
01:13:40,727 --> 01:13:42,560
You're going the wrong way.

1237
01:13:42,643 --> 01:13:45,268
Who asked you to drop Sonam
at someone's house?

1238
01:13:45,352 --> 01:13:47,810
What do you mean, "wrong way"?
Where are we going?

1239
01:13:47,893 --> 01:13:49,768
-It's wrong--
-We're going to Versova.

1240
01:13:49,852 --> 01:13:52,310
Versova? Why are we going
to Versova, dumbfuck?

1241
01:13:52,393 --> 01:13:53,977
Who asked you to drop her at Versova?

1242
01:13:54,060 --> 01:13:56,685
-You told me to.
-When did I say that? Why are you lying?

1243
01:13:56,768 --> 01:13:58,435
I'm not lying. You asked me to do this

1244
01:13:58,518 --> 01:14:00,602
when I visited your office
asking for a role.

1245
01:14:00,685 --> 01:14:01,810
Are you an actor?

1246
01:14:01,893 --> 01:14:03,227
Yes, Anil sir, I'm an actor.

1247
01:14:03,310 --> 01:14:05,518
Do you think
you're the only actor in India?

1248
01:14:05,602 --> 01:14:07,602
Why the fuck are you laughing?

1249
01:14:08,143 --> 01:14:09,185
What the fuck is going on?

1250
01:14:09,268 --> 01:14:10,602
Why the fuck are you asking her?

1251
01:14:10,685 --> 01:14:13,268
Because she knows the plan,
she knows the script!

1252
01:14:14,352 --> 01:14:16,518
Who asked you to drop Sonam at Versova?

1253
01:14:16,602 --> 01:14:18,477
-You did. You have forgotten.
-Fuck that.

1254
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:19,477
Where is Sonam?

1255
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:22,018
I can't tell you where Sonam is,
but she is not in Versova.

1256
01:14:22,102 --> 01:14:23,393
I can tell you that much.

1257
01:14:23,477 --> 01:14:24,727
When did I tell you?

1258
01:14:24,810 --> 01:14:28,143
-Show me. Did you note down the address?
-I remember the address.

1259
01:14:29,185 --> 01:14:30,185
Why are you lying?

1260
01:14:30,268 --> 01:14:31,268
I am not lying.

1261
01:14:31,810 --> 01:14:34,768
I will fuck you up, do you understand?

1262
01:14:35,643 --> 01:14:37,560
Quiet.

1263
01:14:37,643 --> 01:14:38,977
Anand is calling.

1264
01:14:40,935 --> 01:14:42,018
Yeah, Anand, tell me.

1265
01:14:42,102 --> 01:14:44,560
-What's happening? Where are you?
<i>-Outside the police station.</i>

1266
01:14:44,643 --> 01:14:45,893
What? But why?

1267
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:49,310
Everything is okay,
I'm gonna meet her in ten minutes.

1268
01:14:49,393 --> 01:14:51,477
<i>Just tell me now,</i>
<i>where are you going to meet her?</i>

1269
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:54,227
<i>-I will also come there.</i>
-I'll meet her in ten minutes.

1270
01:14:54,310 --> 01:14:55,935
I'm just gonna meet her in ten minutes.

1271
01:14:56,018 --> 01:14:58,435
If you want,
I'll make her speak to you, okay?

1272
01:14:58,518 --> 01:15:00,435
<i>AK, what the fuck is going on?</i>

1273
01:15:00,518 --> 01:15:04,518
Fuck! Fuck knows
what the fuck is going on!

1274
01:15:04,602 --> 01:15:07,185
It's the wrong way.
You're wasting time. Sonam is not there.

1275
01:15:07,268 --> 01:15:09,185
Shut up!

1276
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:12,352
-Where do we go? Tell me.
-Versova.

1277
01:15:20,810 --> 01:15:22,435
We crossed Versova. Where is it?

1278
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:24,518
-Yari Road.
-Left?

1279
01:15:24,602 --> 01:15:27,352
Yari Road?
Yari Road was not in the script.

1280
01:15:27,435 --> 01:15:30,268
-It was not in the script.
-I am doing what you asked me.

1281
01:15:30,352 --> 01:15:33,018
When did I tell you this?
What did I tell you?

1282
01:15:33,102 --> 01:15:34,102
Sir…

1283
01:15:34,185 --> 01:15:35,810
-Where are you taking us?
-Don't hit me.

1284
01:15:35,893 --> 01:15:37,477
-I'll fuck you up!
-Please don't hit me.

1285
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:39,143
-Anil sir also hit me.
-Where now?

1286
01:15:39,227 --> 01:15:40,560
Keep going straight.

1287
01:15:40,643 --> 01:15:42,518
-It's the wrong way.
-I did what you told me.

1288
01:15:42,602 --> 01:15:44,560
I am telling you, Sonam is not here.

1289
01:15:44,643 --> 01:15:46,893
-Javed, which way?
-Keep going straight.

1290
01:15:46,977 --> 01:15:48,852
Left from the mutton shop.

1291
01:15:48,935 --> 01:15:51,435
-Fucker, what are you doing?
-Don't hit me.

1292
01:15:51,518 --> 01:15:53,477
-Should I turn left?
-Left, sir.

1293
01:15:54,185 --> 01:15:55,893
-This building.
-This is the wrong place.

1294
01:15:55,977 --> 01:15:57,685
This is wrong. It's not in the script.

1295
01:15:57,768 --> 01:16:00,018
It's not in the script.
Javed, what are you doing?

1296
01:16:00,102 --> 01:16:01,893
-Javed!
-Sir, fourth floor, 402.

1297
01:16:01,977 --> 01:16:03,143
He's fooling you, sir!

1298
01:16:03,227 --> 01:16:05,768
Where are you going?

1299
01:16:05,852 --> 01:16:08,143
This is not in the script.
This is not the right place.

1300
01:16:08,227 --> 01:16:09,893
It's your script. You must know!

1301
01:16:09,977 --> 01:16:12,727
Exactly! This is my house!
My parents live here!

1302
01:16:12,810 --> 01:16:15,227
They've already received threats.
Why would I bring you here?

1303
01:16:15,310 --> 01:16:18,518
-Get down.
-The film is about Anil Kapoor, not me.

1304
01:16:18,602 --> 01:16:19,852
Just get down!

1305
01:16:19,935 --> 01:16:21,060
But what is he doing?

1306
01:16:22,352 --> 01:16:23,352
Javed!

1307
01:16:35,727 --> 01:16:37,310
What are you doing with my bag?

1308
01:16:40,310 --> 01:16:41,727
FaceTime your guy.

1309
01:16:43,018 --> 01:16:44,268
I want to see Sonam.

1310
01:16:48,810 --> 01:16:50,518
Sonam is not here. I've told you already.

1311
01:16:57,060 --> 01:16:58,560
Pick up, Master!

1312
01:17:01,477 --> 01:17:03,810
If it's not your house,
is it a DVD rental place?

1313
01:17:03,893 --> 01:17:04,727
Come on.

1314
01:17:05,977 --> 01:17:07,810
I don't know what's going on.

1315
01:17:07,893 --> 01:17:09,602
-What's going on?
-I don't know.

1316
01:17:09,685 --> 01:17:12,768
-How's that possible? You know the script.
-Elevator's broken. Which floor?

1317
01:17:12,852 --> 01:17:14,018
-Fourth floor.
-Come on.

1318
01:17:14,602 --> 01:17:15,602
I don't know!

1319
01:17:15,685 --> 01:17:17,727
Why is the door open?

1320
01:17:19,977 --> 01:17:20,977
Shrilal?

1321
01:17:22,018 --> 01:17:23,018
Shrilal!

1322
01:17:24,977 --> 01:17:26,185
Why are you going upstairs?

1323
01:17:26,893 --> 01:17:28,477
That's where my DVD library is.

1324
01:17:40,477 --> 01:17:41,477
What's going on?

1325
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:43,560
Where is Sonam?

1326
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:45,602
I don't know.

1327
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:47,935
-What's going on?
-Where is Sonam?

1328
01:17:48,018 --> 01:17:49,768
-I don't know.
-I don't know where Sonam is.

1329
01:17:49,852 --> 01:17:51,102
What's going on?

1330
01:17:51,185 --> 01:17:53,018
We just saw her here on FaceTime!

1331
01:17:53,102 --> 01:17:55,185
But she's not here! What's going on?

1332
01:17:55,268 --> 01:17:57,352
-I don't know!
-Why are you asking her?

1333
01:17:57,435 --> 01:17:58,727
Did she write the script?

1334
01:17:58,810 --> 01:18:01,727
I wrote it, but she was with me.
She knew all about it.

1335
01:18:01,810 --> 01:18:03,768
Where is Sonam? Sonam…

1336
01:18:03,852 --> 01:18:05,560
My parents are sleeping there!

1337
01:18:13,143 --> 01:18:14,310
Where are your parents?

1338
01:18:15,518 --> 01:18:16,727
Where are your parents?

1339
01:18:17,268 --> 01:18:19,352
Where is Sonam?

1340
01:18:52,143 --> 01:18:54,977
Hello, Shrilal. Answer the phone, man.

1341
01:18:55,060 --> 01:18:56,477
Where are Mom and Dad?

1342
01:18:57,352 --> 01:18:59,352
Where are Mom and Dad?
They are not in their room.

1343
01:19:00,352 --> 01:19:02,185
Yes, I'm at home. Where are Mom and Dad?

1344
01:19:02,852 --> 01:19:04,893
Forget it, it's pointless.
I'll figure it out.

1345
01:19:05,727 --> 01:19:06,685
What's going on?

1346
01:19:06,768 --> 01:19:07,935
What the fuck is going on?

1347
01:19:10,310 --> 01:19:11,935
-Hey!
-What's going on?

1348
01:19:12,852 --> 01:19:14,560
-Sir!
-Where are Mom and Dad?

1349
01:19:14,643 --> 01:19:16,477
-I don't know!
-Where are they?

1350
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:19,227
-What the fuck is going--
-Please, I don't know!

1351
01:19:22,518 --> 01:19:25,977
Fucking Tarantino, enough with your movie!

1352
01:19:26,810 --> 01:19:29,393
Now tell me, where is Sonam?

1353
01:19:29,477 --> 01:19:33,143
Otherwise, I will put an end to you
before the end of the film!

1354
01:19:34,102 --> 01:19:36,227
I don't even know where my parents are!

1355
01:19:36,310 --> 01:19:37,602
Fuck your parents!

1356
01:19:38,143 --> 01:19:39,435
I just want my Sonam.

1357
01:19:42,768 --> 01:19:45,018
Tell me, where is Sonam?

1358
01:19:45,102 --> 01:19:49,185
Or I will fucking kill you!
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

1359
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:31,560
I really don't know.

1360
01:20:33,685 --> 01:20:36,810
I knew what was happening
till things were going as per my script.

1361
01:20:37,602 --> 01:20:39,352
But someone hijacked my script.

1362
01:20:39,435 --> 01:20:40,602
Cut the drama.

1363
01:20:40,685 --> 01:20:42,685
It's not drama.
Someone hijacked my script.

1364
01:20:42,768 --> 01:20:44,018
I don't know where Sonam is.

1365
01:20:44,102 --> 01:20:47,060
I don't know where my parents are.
They weren't even part of the script.

1366
01:20:53,102 --> 01:20:54,602
Who are you calling?

1367
01:20:54,685 --> 01:20:57,310
I will find Sonam. I will find everyone.

1368
01:21:02,227 --> 01:21:03,977
-Hello?
<i>-Hello, Versova Police Station.</i>

1369
01:21:04,060 --> 01:21:06,768
Versova Police Station,
I am calling from Yari Road.

1370
01:21:06,852 --> 01:21:08,685
<i>-Who's speaking?</i>
-My name is Anurag Kashyap.

1371
01:21:08,768 --> 01:21:10,018
I'm a filmmaker.

1372
01:21:10,102 --> 01:21:12,268
-I want to report a kidnapping.
<i>-Kashyap?</i>

1373
01:21:12,352 --> 01:21:14,185
<i>The one who made </i>Dabangg?

1374
01:21:14,268 --> 01:21:16,268
No, sir, my brother made that one.

1375
01:21:16,352 --> 01:21:18,310
His name is Abhinav Kashyap.
I'm Anurag Kashyap.

1376
01:21:19,268 --> 01:21:21,602
We are making a film right now and…

1377
01:21:21,685 --> 01:21:22,518
<i>Hello?</i>

1378
01:21:24,643 --> 01:21:25,893
<i>What's your complaint?</i>

1379
01:21:27,060 --> 01:21:28,310
<i>What do you want to report?</i>

1380
01:21:28,393 --> 01:21:30,143
Yes, hold on for a minute.

1381
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:46,477
<i>Hello?</i>

1382
01:21:49,935 --> 01:21:51,018
<i>Hello?</i>

1383
01:21:51,102 --> 01:21:52,143
<i>Mr. Kashyap?</i>

1384
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:57,727
Who are these two?

1385
01:21:59,060 --> 01:22:00,435
That's my mom and dad.

1386
01:22:33,393 --> 01:22:38,102
Where did Javed take Sonam
in your original script?

1387
01:22:38,977 --> 01:22:41,018
To Byculla.

1388
01:22:41,102 --> 01:22:43,685
-At United Mills.
-Byculla? Let's go.

1389
01:22:56,227 --> 01:22:57,935
We are in the wrong lane. It's a one-way.

1390
01:22:58,018 --> 01:22:59,393
I know that, dumbfuck!

1391
01:23:01,643 --> 01:23:03,393
-Move!
-Get out of my way!

1392
01:23:12,852 --> 01:23:13,893
Move!

1393
01:23:17,643 --> 01:23:19,518
Check Google Maps. What does it say?

1394
01:23:23,185 --> 01:23:24,477
Check faster!

1395
01:23:25,143 --> 01:23:27,352
One hour, seven minutes.
We won't reach on time.

1396
01:23:28,102 --> 01:23:29,727
Stop whining, asshole.

1397
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:32,602
This is all a part of your plan,

1398
01:23:32,685 --> 01:23:35,935
to purposely delay me
so that I lose my daughter.

1399
01:23:36,477 --> 01:23:40,768
Your ending was always decided.
Why do you want to make this film?

1400
01:23:40,852 --> 01:23:44,477
All you want to prove is that
you're a bigger AK than Anil Kapoor!

1401
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:45,935
This is fun to you, right?

1402
01:23:46,018 --> 01:23:47,685
You still think this is scripted?

1403
01:23:47,768 --> 01:23:49,060
Yes, I do!

1404
01:23:49,143 --> 01:23:50,602
Because I don't trust you!

1405
01:23:50,685 --> 01:23:53,227
You can fucking stoop
to any level, Anurag!

1406
01:23:59,393 --> 01:24:01,893
<i>AK, I'm sitting with the cops now.</i>
<i>I warned you.</i>

1407
01:24:02,602 --> 01:24:04,185
Do whatever you think is right.

1408
01:24:04,268 --> 01:24:05,352
You do what you want.

1409
01:24:14,018 --> 01:24:15,185
Take a left.

1410
01:24:33,143 --> 01:24:34,977
-Who is this?
-Who is this?

1411
01:24:37,852 --> 01:24:38,810
Who are you?

1412
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:42,102
I am asking you, who are you?

1413
01:24:42,893 --> 01:24:43,935
Who is this?

1414
01:24:45,518 --> 01:24:46,518
Come on.

1415
01:24:54,102 --> 01:24:55,268
There is no one here.

1416
01:24:55,352 --> 01:24:57,768
I can see that.
I'm not blind, motherfucker!

1417
01:24:59,060 --> 01:25:00,352
Where the fuck are they?

1418
01:25:02,310 --> 01:25:04,477
They were supposed to be here.
Who are you?

1419
01:25:05,102 --> 01:25:06,060
Who the fuck are you?

1420
01:25:07,060 --> 01:25:08,810
I want to talk to her. Where are they?

1421
01:25:08,893 --> 01:25:11,268
-Tell me, where the fuck are they?
-Sonam was right here.

1422
01:25:11,352 --> 01:25:14,143
-This is where Sonam was.
-It's your film, everything's yours!

1423
01:25:14,227 --> 01:25:16,143
Find her! FaceTime her!

1424
01:25:16,935 --> 01:25:18,185
I don't have my bag.

1425
01:25:19,060 --> 01:25:20,018
Where is the bag?

1426
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:24,643
What the fuck is going on? Who are you?

1427
01:25:24,727 --> 01:25:26,560
Who are you? Who sent you here?

1428
01:25:27,727 --> 01:25:28,768
Who the fuck is he?

1429
01:25:30,102 --> 01:25:32,727
Cut the camera and talk to me! Who is he?

1430
01:25:37,893 --> 01:25:39,143
What the fuck is going on?

1431
01:25:40,060 --> 01:25:41,060
What is it?

1432
01:25:41,143 --> 01:25:42,768
Camera keeps rolling. Rule number three.

1433
01:25:42,852 --> 01:25:44,893
Fuck the rule!
It's my rule. I can change it.

1434
01:25:44,977 --> 01:25:45,977
What's going on?

1435
01:25:46,060 --> 01:25:47,102
Who the fuck are you?

1436
01:25:56,352 --> 01:25:57,810
Fuck the rule, Yogita. Please.

1437
01:25:57,893 --> 01:25:59,602
If you know what's going on, please.

1438
01:25:59,685 --> 01:26:00,727
Where are my parents?

1439
01:26:00,810 --> 01:26:02,560
-Anurag!
-I know you've fucking done it.

1440
01:26:02,643 --> 01:26:04,393
I want to know where the fuck is everyone.

1441
01:26:04,477 --> 01:26:07,602
Just come here!
Anurag, don't waste time.

1442
01:26:08,518 --> 01:26:10,018
I know your fucking plan.

1443
01:26:18,185 --> 01:26:20,727
Check where Sonam is.

1444
01:26:28,643 --> 01:26:29,477
Fuck, man.

1445
01:26:39,060 --> 01:26:40,018
What is this?

1446
01:26:41,018 --> 01:26:42,143
What the fuck is this?

1447
01:26:45,852 --> 01:26:47,227
I'm not doing this.

1448
01:26:47,310 --> 01:26:49,185
-It's someone else.
-Try again.

1449
01:26:49,852 --> 01:26:51,268
Someone else is doing this.

1450
01:26:51,352 --> 01:26:52,935
-Just try again.
-Who is doing this?

1451
01:26:54,977 --> 01:26:56,602
{\an8}This was not in my script.

1452
01:26:57,810 --> 01:26:59,518
It wasn't supposed to be like this.

1453
01:27:12,893 --> 01:27:14,560
This was not in the script.

1454
01:27:15,393 --> 01:27:18,393
None of this was in the script.

1455
01:27:20,102 --> 01:27:22,977
I don't know what's happening.
Someone…

1456
01:27:23,060 --> 01:27:24,727
You can read the script.

1457
01:27:26,643 --> 01:27:28,560
This was the script. This was the plan.

1458
01:27:29,268 --> 01:27:30,518
You can read it for yourself.

1459
01:27:36,935 --> 01:27:38,643
I don't know what the fuck is going on.

1460
01:27:40,602 --> 01:27:42,018
Will you tell me what's going on?

1461
01:27:45,810 --> 01:27:47,227
Stop fucking shooting!

1462
01:28:00,435 --> 01:28:03,727
"Anurag forcefully enters
Anil Kapoor's makeup van."

1463
01:28:09,643 --> 01:28:11,893
"Anurag knows the story won't go anywhere

1464
01:28:11,977 --> 01:28:17,143
until Anil Kapoor believes
that Anurag has kidnapped Sonam."

1465
01:28:19,810 --> 01:28:25,518
"Anurag has to make sure
Anil Kapoor calls Sonam."

1466
01:28:25,602 --> 01:28:28,810
"And at one point,
he will have to cut Sonam's finger."

1467
01:28:29,393 --> 01:28:31,018
-What the fuck!
-It was not cut.

1468
01:28:31,102 --> 01:28:34,143
It's a film. We used prosthetic makeup.
Why would I cut her finger?

1469
01:28:38,352 --> 01:28:42,477
"Anurag keeps reminding
Anil of the time he has left."

1470
01:28:43,435 --> 01:28:46,477
"Anil Kapoor has to find Javed."

1471
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:48,060
You knew everything.

1472
01:28:48,727 --> 01:28:51,935
Bandra, taxi stand, Javed,
the house. You knew everything.

1473
01:28:52,018 --> 01:28:53,893
My house is not in the script.

1474
01:28:53,977 --> 01:28:56,810
-Please, keep reading.
-Everything is written here.

1475
01:28:56,893 --> 01:29:01,893
"Javed drops them outside
Anurag's house and runs away."

1476
01:29:02,768 --> 01:29:07,685
"And at home, Anurag is out of breath,
he collapses with an asthma attack."

1477
01:29:07,768 --> 01:29:09,060
-This is not--
-It's all there.

1478
01:29:09,143 --> 01:29:11,602
The script has been changed.
She changed it.

1479
01:29:11,685 --> 01:29:15,102
-This script was in your bag!
-Only she has access to my bag.

1480
01:29:15,977 --> 01:29:16,977
You're lying.

1481
01:29:17,060 --> 01:29:18,893
Why would I lie?

1482
01:29:18,977 --> 01:29:21,727
You made me run circles around the city,
all the way to Versova,

1483
01:29:21,810 --> 01:29:23,393
just so I don't reach here on time.

1484
01:29:23,477 --> 01:29:25,768
Versova was not in my plan.

1485
01:29:25,852 --> 01:29:27,935
My parents were not in my plan.

1486
01:29:28,018 --> 01:29:31,102
According to my script,
you should've found Sonam here.

1487
01:29:31,185 --> 01:29:34,102
We would reach here, and the climax
was supposed to be between us.

1488
01:29:35,102 --> 01:29:36,268
What's written in the climax?

1489
01:29:37,727 --> 01:29:39,310
Read it, asshole!

1490
01:29:42,102 --> 01:29:44,768
"Anurag takes
Anil Kapoor to United Mills."

1491
01:29:45,560 --> 01:29:47,643
"There, he finds a masked cameraman."

1492
01:29:50,685 --> 01:29:52,602
"Anurag asks him who he is."

1493
01:29:53,143 --> 01:29:54,852
"Then he sees another cameraman."

1494
01:29:55,643 --> 01:29:58,352
"Anurag claims
that someone has hijacked his script."

1495
01:30:00,477 --> 01:30:02,727
"Sonam is not there,
Anil Kapoor breaks down."

1496
01:30:02,810 --> 01:30:06,435
"He falls to his knees and begs
Anurag to return his daughter."

1497
01:30:07,185 --> 01:30:12,435
"Instead of returning Sonam,
Anurag takes a gun out of his bag…"

1498
01:30:37,685 --> 01:30:38,602
Read it.

1499
01:30:44,643 --> 01:30:47,977
"Anurag says to Anil,

1500
01:30:49,185 --> 01:30:52,102
'You're just an actor, Anil Kapoor.
Nothing more.'

1501
01:30:52,185 --> 01:30:56,643
'You've been
showing off your swag for 40 years.'

1502
01:30:56,727 --> 01:31:00,727
'Tonight, Anurag Kashyap
stripped you off of your fake acting.'

1503
01:31:01,352 --> 01:31:04,310
'Today, you've bled
real blood and cried real tears.'

1504
01:31:05,102 --> 01:31:08,768
'For the first time in your life, you
haven't acted but actually lived a role.'

1505
01:31:11,602 --> 01:31:14,393
'You… you should be thanking me.'

1506
01:31:14,477 --> 01:31:16,602
'My director's work here is done.'

1507
01:31:17,185 --> 01:31:21,018
'Now you'll always wonder
why you hadn't done <i>Allwyn Kalicharan.'</i>

1508
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:26,310
'If you had, you could have saved Sonam.'

1509
01:31:27,352 --> 01:31:29,435
'You have two choices now.'"

1510
01:31:38,352 --> 01:31:39,352
Keep reading.

1511
01:31:41,768 --> 01:31:46,268
"Either kill yourself,
because you couldn't save Sonam,

1512
01:31:48,268 --> 01:31:49,518
or shoot me."

1513
01:31:49,602 --> 01:31:51,518
Why would I write this rubbish?

1514
01:31:51,602 --> 01:31:54,602
Why would I provoke you to shoot me?

1515
01:31:55,810 --> 01:31:57,560
I have a daughter, too.

1516
01:31:57,643 --> 01:31:59,977
My parents were also kidnapped.
Why would I write this?

1517
01:32:00,060 --> 01:32:03,310
Well, you did say…
you can die for cinema.

1518
01:32:03,393 --> 01:32:05,518
-But it's all her doing.
-Sit.

1519
01:32:07,060 --> 01:32:09,060
Sit, motherfucker! Sit!

1520
01:32:13,727 --> 01:32:15,352
I haven't written this.

1521
01:32:15,435 --> 01:32:17,060
I beg of you.

1522
01:32:17,602 --> 01:32:19,393
I am 47 years old.

1523
01:32:19,977 --> 01:32:23,852
Everybody I love has left me.
None of my films work at the box office.

1524
01:32:23,935 --> 01:32:25,560
I'm dealing with a midlife crisis.

1525
01:32:25,643 --> 01:32:27,810
I just want to be
a good father, that's all.

1526
01:32:27,893 --> 01:32:29,060
Midlife crisis?

1527
01:32:30,352 --> 01:32:31,435
Have I not failed?

1528
01:32:32,393 --> 01:32:34,893
You think I haven't had a midlife crisis?

1529
01:32:35,768 --> 01:32:38,310
You have one daughter.
I have three children, Anurag.

1530
01:32:40,352 --> 01:32:42,643
I've been
running around like a dog all night.

1531
01:32:43,393 --> 01:32:47,435
I danced on stage like a monkey.

1532
01:32:49,060 --> 01:32:50,810
Can you dance for your daughter?

1533
01:32:52,768 --> 01:32:54,227
Dance, asshole!

1534
01:32:54,810 --> 01:32:56,393
Dance for your daughter today!

1535
01:32:59,268 --> 01:33:01,768
Just because I've been married
to one woman my whole life

1536
01:33:01,852 --> 01:33:04,227
I have to pay for your failed marriages?

1537
01:33:04,310 --> 01:33:06,477
Motherfucker! Tell me where Sonam is!

1538
01:33:06,560 --> 01:33:08,977
-I don't know.
-Tell me, Kashyap!

1539
01:33:09,060 --> 01:33:10,810
-I really don't know!
-Where is she?

1540
01:33:12,852 --> 01:33:13,852
Fuck.

1541
01:33:15,810 --> 01:33:16,810
Fuck!

1542
01:33:16,893 --> 01:33:17,977
Help me.

1543
01:33:19,185 --> 01:33:20,102
Help me!

1544
01:33:21,060 --> 01:33:21,893
Yeah.

{\an8}<i>to work in his next film.</i>

1555
01:34:11,477 --> 01:34:13,185
{\an8}-Sonam ma'am!
-Please, Sonam ma'am!

1556
01:34:13,268 --> 01:34:14,268
{\an8}Who is behind this?

1557
01:34:17,852 --> 01:34:18,852
{\an8}Sonam?

1558
01:34:20,935 --> 01:34:21,852
{\an8}Dad.

1559
01:34:38,893 --> 01:34:40,643
He planned everything.

1560
01:34:42,852 --> 01:34:46,393
He told us what to do, and when to do it.

1561
01:34:48,518 --> 01:34:50,768
He said this would be a cinema movement.

1562
01:34:52,393 --> 01:34:56,852
And after this, no one would forget us.
No one would forget this film.

1563
01:34:56,935 --> 01:34:58,852
We would go to Cannes.

1564
01:35:04,893 --> 01:35:06,352
I didn't know he was insane.

1565
01:35:45,685 --> 01:35:48,768
I love it when a plan comes together.

1566
01:35:51,560 --> 01:35:52,393
And cut!

1567
01:35:55,310 --> 01:35:58,352
<i>He wants to be a hero at this age.</i>

1568
01:35:58,435 --> 01:36:00,810
"My Name Is Lakhan"
is a thing of the past.

1569
01:36:00,893 --> 01:36:03,602
"My Name is Lakhan…"
Now you're Anil uncle.

1570
01:36:27,060 --> 01:36:28,393
Fuck!

1571
01:36:29,185 --> 01:36:31,185
<i>In 2020, you've</i>
<i>turned into Mr. India again.</i>

1572
01:36:31,268 --> 01:36:32,727
<i>You've disappeared from the screens.</i>

1573
01:36:32,810 --> 01:36:34,060
Invisible and irrelevant.

1574
01:36:41,268 --> 01:36:42,393
Who's there?

1575
01:36:44,060 --> 01:36:45,852
Who is it? Just come in!

1576
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:47,393
Sir…

1577
01:36:47,935 --> 01:36:50,060
Anurag sir left his phone here.

1578
01:36:50,143 --> 01:36:51,310
Can I please take it?

1579
01:36:54,185 --> 01:36:55,602
-Come in.
-Thank you, sir.

1580
01:37:04,768 --> 01:37:05,768
Listen, what's your name?

1581
01:37:06,477 --> 01:37:07,518
Yogita.

1582
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:14,018
Do you want to be Anurag's minion forever
or achieve something in life?

1583
01:37:20,352 --> 01:37:22,143
Do you want to become a director?

1584
01:37:28,268 --> 01:37:29,102
Sir.

1585
01:37:32,768 --> 01:37:35,602
Sir, I think you should do something.

1586
01:37:35,685 --> 01:37:36,852
I'm thinking about it.

1587
01:37:42,018 --> 01:37:43,602
I have an idea.

1588
01:38:13,560 --> 01:38:15,893
<i>You don't have to act at all.</i>
<i>Sonam Kapoor is missing.</i>

1589
01:38:15,977 --> 01:38:17,477
You have to find her before sunrise.

1590
01:38:17,560 --> 01:38:20,435
<i>I acted just like a character</i>
<i>from one of your films.</i>

1591
01:38:20,518 --> 01:38:24,143
<i>Nawazuddin Siddiqui</i>
<i>has never been this real.</i>

1592
01:38:24,727 --> 01:38:29,143
<i>I bled real blood,</i>
<i>performed for the real public.</i>

1593
01:38:29,227 --> 01:38:31,268
<i>The complete package of entertainment.</i>

1594
01:38:31,893 --> 01:38:35,393
<i>And since you see the world</i>
<i>only through your camera lens,</i>

1595
01:38:35,477 --> 01:38:41,060
<i>you couldn't see that</i>
<i>my entire family was my supporting cast.</i>

1596
01:38:44,393 --> 01:38:45,393
Sorry, Dad.

1597
01:38:47,018 --> 01:38:48,852
Justice!

1598
01:38:49,393 --> 01:38:50,435
Javed, stop!

1599
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:54,102
This is wrong. It's not in the script.

1600
01:38:54,185 --> 01:38:55,602
Javed, what are you doing? Javed!

1601
01:38:58,227 --> 01:38:59,143
It's open.

1602
01:38:59,227 --> 01:39:01,435
The film is about Anil Kapoor, not me.

1603
01:39:01,518 --> 01:39:02,893
Just get down!

1604
01:39:02,977 --> 01:39:04,310
But what is he doing?

1605
01:39:05,685 --> 01:39:06,810
Javed!

1606
01:39:16,768 --> 01:39:19,060
But she's not here! What's going on?

1607
01:39:19,143 --> 01:39:20,768
Why are you asking her?

1608
01:39:20,852 --> 01:39:23,310
The script has been changed.
She changed it.

1609
01:39:23,393 --> 01:39:24,768
This script was in your bag!

1610
01:39:24,852 --> 01:39:26,268
-Tell me, Kashyap!
-I don't know!

1611
01:39:26,352 --> 01:39:27,560
Where is she?

1612
01:39:33,185 --> 01:39:36,810
Anil Kapoor has been a star for 40 years.

1613
01:39:37,768 --> 01:39:39,602
And will remain one till his last breath.

1614
01:39:41,435 --> 01:39:42,685
And FYFI…

1615
01:39:43,393 --> 01:39:45,227
For your fucking information…

1616
01:39:46,060 --> 01:39:48,977
I have won six Filmfare Awards, not four.

1617
01:39:49,060 --> 01:39:51,810
<i>Off, off, off you go!</i>

1618
01:39:51,893 --> 01:39:54,810
<i>Off, off, take a hike!</i>

1619
01:39:54,893 --> 01:39:57,560
<i>Off, out, take a hike!</i>

1620
01:40:00,227 --> 01:40:02,352
<i>Off, off…</i>

1621
01:40:03,560 --> 01:40:05,227
<i>Off, off</i>

1622
01:40:06,435 --> 01:40:09,352
<i>Off, out, take a hike!</i>

1623
01:40:11,560 --> 01:40:14,310
<i>A gamechanger star</i>
<i>My swag is killer</i>

1627
01:40:23,310 --> 01:40:25,435
<i>Did you get what I said?</i>

1628
01:40:25,518 --> 01:40:28,143
<i>This star shines in the dark</i>

1629
01:40:28,227 --> 01:40:31,018
<i>The world is wondering</i>
<i>Why am I forever young?</i>

1630
01:40:31,102 --> 01:40:34,185
<i>Who is successful?</i>
<i>Who is living in hell?</i>

1631
01:40:34,268 --> 01:40:36,352
<i>Year was 1956</i>
<i>Day was December 24</i>

1632
01:40:36,435 --> 01:40:38,435
<i>My karma is my buddy</i>
<i>Since the day I was born</i>

1633
01:40:38,518 --> 01:40:41,352
<i>My pop said, fear not!</i>
<i>Everyone has to die one day…</i>

1634
01:40:41,435 --> 01:40:43,560
<i>Police investigation reveals the truth.</i>

1635
01:40:43,643 --> 01:40:47,352
<i>To save himself from Kashyap,</i>
<i>Anil Kapoor had to shoot him.</i>

1636
01:40:47,435 --> 01:40:49,227
<i>Kashyap has now been arrested.</i>

1637
01:40:49,310 --> 01:40:51,727
<i>He might be sentenced</i>
<i>for eight to fifteen years.</i>

1638
01:40:51,810 --> 01:40:53,268
<i>In every film</i>

1639
01:40:53,893 --> 01:40:55,310
<i>I said jhakaas!</i>

1640
01:40:55,393 --> 01:40:58,268
{\an8}<i>I tore my enemies apart</i>

1641
01:40:58,352 --> 01:41:01,560
{\an8}<i>Anil Kapoor's next film,</i>

<i>Take a chill pill</i>

1647
01:41:16,352 --> 01:41:19,685
{\an8}<i>Absolutely jhakaas!</i>

1648
01:41:26,477 --> 01:41:28,893
<i>Acting is a God's gift to me</i>

1649
01:41:28,977 --> 01:41:31,810
<i>One day's minister</i>
<i>Saved the nation</i>

Best Film Director for my first film!

Oh, my God!

1667
01:42:17,352 --> 01:42:18,352
<i>Anil sir!</i>

1668
01:42:18,435 --> 01:42:21,227

You saved Sonam. You saved me!

1670
01:42:24,685 --> 01:42:26,352
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1671
01:42:26,435 --> 01:42:29,977
<i>And the Best Actor, Male,</i>
<i>of the year goes to…</i>

1672
01:42:32,602 --> 01:42:33,643
They say…

1673
01:42:34,393 --> 01:42:37,685
when you act, you leave
a little bit of your soul behind.

1674
01:42:37,768 --> 01:42:40,977
But over here, I think it was a bit more.

1675
01:42:41,477 --> 01:42:44,268
You bled for real, you hurt for real.

1676
01:42:46,143 --> 01:42:47,560
And you cried for real.

1677
01:42:47,643 --> 01:42:49,727
Only you could have done this.
