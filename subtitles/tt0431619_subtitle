1
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:57,380
KANYAKUMARI

2
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,166
Love is...

3
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:17,103
a four letter epic poem...

4
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,239
a sea of 2 drops of tears...

5
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:23,579
Every living being
searches for love

6
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,411
Every living being
waits for love

7
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,978
It has no reason
for it's birth.

8
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,782
No one knows when
and how it starts.

9
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:36,190
It's a journey to eternity.

10
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,215
Where's Geethanjali?

11
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,418
I'm searching you...

12
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:09,751
I'm waiting for you...

13
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:12,017
To see you once,

14
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:18,361
I'm ready to die
a million deaths.

15
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:39,382
I wish may you get the girl
you are waiting for.

16
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:40,910
...from a girl

17
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,594
Wow! This is golden sunrise!

18
00:04:28,934 --> 00:04:30,424
I'm ready to die for that girl.

19
00:04:35,774 --> 00:04:37,435
You both back off, first I'll
give my life for her.

20
00:04:37,609 --> 00:04:40,373
First me! - No, me first!

21
00:04:41,446 --> 00:04:43,038
This is not a joke.
I'm serious now.

22
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:54,521
If you really love her,
no need to die for her.

23
00:04:54,626 --> 00:04:55,854
Get her anklets.

24
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:09,664
Again same dream?
Same Kanyakumari incident?

25
00:05:09,975 --> 00:05:13,138
Forget it. Don't get tensed thinking
about it again and again.

26
00:05:13,478 --> 00:05:16,072
You're feeling unnecessarily for
a man who died for an anklet.

27
00:05:16,315 --> 00:05:18,977
Did you ask him to die?
Life with you is very difficult.

28
00:05:19,151 --> 00:05:20,311
Any little incident you
take it to your heart.

29
00:05:20,485 --> 00:05:22,146
Watching T.V. till late night,
come on get up.

30
00:05:22,321 --> 00:05:23,754
You heard, didn't you?
Get up quickly & get ready.

31
00:05:25,657 --> 00:05:26,555
Coming...

32
00:05:27,993 --> 00:05:28,891
I'm going.

33
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:32,889
Don't think too much
and get confused, okay?

34
00:05:39,004 --> 00:05:41,336
Geetha, come quickly.
First class is by Veerappan.

35
00:05:41,673 --> 00:05:43,106
He's not a teacher,
but a dinosaur.

36
00:08:05,484 --> 00:08:06,314
Who's that girl?

37
00:08:06,485 --> 00:08:08,646
Name is Geetha.
Very strict girl.

38
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,310
Every member in our gang
has tried her.

39
00:08:10,489 --> 00:08:11,820
She didn't fall for anyone.

40
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:14,151
Mother promise.
You too will fail.

41
00:08:14,659 --> 00:08:16,149
You may also fail....

42
00:08:34,012 --> 00:08:36,412
Brother...dash.
Have books fallen down?

43
00:08:37,682 --> 00:08:40,674
Yes brother! - Are they collecting
each other's books?

44
00:08:43,188 --> 00:08:45,850
You are right brother!
- Are they saying sorry to each other?

45
00:08:48,026 --> 00:08:49,084
You are right again, brother!

46
00:08:50,862 --> 00:08:52,022
They are going away.

47
00:08:52,197 --> 00:08:55,189
No, they'll turn back to see each
other after few steps...watch.

48
00:09:00,872 --> 00:09:03,705
You're right again!
How could you guess it?

49
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:05,866
I've seen plenty of such
foolish love stories.

50
00:09:06,378 --> 00:09:07,436
He dashed against her today.

51
00:09:07,546 --> 00:09:09,707
Tomorrow, he'll beat anyone
passing comments on her.

52
00:09:09,881 --> 00:09:11,371
After that, he'll ask her to
come to a restaurant

53
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,381
And then a day after that
he'll threaten to die.- Why?

54
00:09:13,552 --> 00:09:14,712
To force her to say,
I love you.

55
00:09:14,886 --> 00:09:17,218
That girl will say it in a
confusion over his threat.

56
00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:20,051
Another love story begins...
...it's once again same routine...

57
00:09:20,225 --> 00:09:21,886
I'm bored seeing such boring
repetitive love stories.

58
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:22,719
You are correct.

59
00:09:22,894 --> 00:09:25,658
Brother...- Why there's
an audio break?

60
00:09:26,231 --> 00:09:29,132
Get up and see it
yourself, brother.

61
00:09:36,908 --> 00:09:38,671
Why did she gave a disgusting look?

62
00:09:40,078 --> 00:09:40,806
This is also routine...

63
00:09:40,912 --> 00:09:48,250
Who are you little girl?
You look gorgeous.

64
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:52,249
You cool down boy.

65
00:09:52,424 --> 00:09:54,255
He didn't know she was your friend.
Forgive him brother.

66
00:09:54,426 --> 00:09:57,020
I'll take care of him.
You wait man.

67
00:09:58,263 --> 00:09:59,594
Why are you getting tensed up?
Do you know who he is?

68
00:09:59,764 --> 00:10:02,255
He's M.P. Avataram's son.
His word is a rule in this college.

69
00:10:02,434 --> 00:10:04,493
If it is broken, people disappear.
Shut up.

70
00:10:07,271 --> 00:10:08,363
Why did you beat him?

71
00:10:08,939 --> 00:10:10,770
Why are you bothered if he
passes comments on me?

72
00:10:11,108 --> 00:10:14,168
Look, I know why you
are doing all this?

73
00:10:14,945 --> 00:10:16,970
Don't play such cheap
tricks on me.

74
00:10:17,448 --> 00:10:18,437
You dashed against
me yesterday.

75
00:10:18,616 --> 00:10:20,106
Today, you beat him for
passing comments on me.

76
00:10:20,284 --> 00:10:21,717
You'll invite me to a
restaurant today evening.

77
00:10:22,119 --> 00:10:24,451
You are coming to
Coffee Day today evening.

78
00:10:43,807 --> 00:10:45,001
Why didn't you come yesterday?

79
00:10:46,477 --> 00:10:47,307
I'm asking you.

80
00:10:48,312 --> 00:10:49,336
Why should I come?

81
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,344
I love you.

82
00:10:54,485 --> 00:10:56,749
If you don't say I love you
in 24 hours,

83
00:10:59,823 --> 00:11:01,313
I'll jump down from
the college rooftop.

84
00:11:05,663 --> 00:11:08,154
Will he jump down really?

85
00:11:08,332 --> 00:11:10,823
I don't know. He is a mad guy.
He may jump.

86
00:11:11,001 --> 00:11:12,434
I know him very well.

87
00:11:13,003 --> 00:11:15,836
Already you are feeling for a man
who died for your anklet.

88
00:11:16,006 --> 00:11:18,998
If this man too jumps down
to his death, you can't live peacefully.

89
00:11:19,343 --> 00:11:21,834
Listen to me. It's just words...
tell him, I love you.

90
00:11:22,012 --> 00:11:22,774
Let's take other things later.

91
00:11:23,013 --> 00:11:25,243
Do you want me to say? - Yes.

92
00:11:29,687 --> 00:11:32,850
Is this all love?
Isn't there anything else?

93
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:36,921
It'll be good if some
one picks up.

94
00:11:37,361 --> 00:11:39,352
Uncle, please help us.

95
00:12:00,217 --> 00:12:01,878
Pull him up.

96
00:12:58,909 --> 00:13:01,742
Hail boisterous youth!

97
00:13:05,749 --> 00:13:10,914
Hail singing and jet speed youth!

98
00:13:12,923 --> 00:13:16,916
Let anything happen,
let's do what we like to do.

99
00:13:17,094 --> 00:13:20,996
Even bitter will taste good
if you get used to it.

100
00:13:21,765 --> 00:13:23,926
Whether it's right or wrong.
Let's do it.

101
00:13:24,101 --> 00:13:26,001
Let's take the first step.

102
00:13:26,436 --> 00:13:29,928
Experience will make one wiser.

103
00:13:30,774 --> 00:13:35,336
If happiness is with you
the world is with you.

104
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,441
Let's sing...

105
00:13:41,284 --> 00:13:43,013
for enthusiasm!

106
00:13:45,956 --> 00:13:47,480
Let's live...

107
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,121
...for love!

108
00:14:50,854 --> 00:14:56,622
Drive away darkness and
defeat with a smile.

109
00:14:57,861 --> 00:14:59,761
Hail the patience!

110
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:05,764
Celebrations must hit like a
typhoon and flood our lives.

111
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,963
Hail the vigor!

112
00:15:09,372 --> 00:15:16,244
Let's run...till we succeed!

113
00:15:18,381 --> 00:15:22,875
There's no going back after
sighting the target.

114
00:16:29,285 --> 00:16:34,951
Your word must break silence
and stop a war!

115
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:38,051
Hail the mastery!

116
00:16:38,294 --> 00:16:44,130
Turn your foe into a friend
with your love.

117
00:16:44,967 --> 00:16:47,197
Hail the victory!

118
00:16:47,803 --> 00:16:54,675
Let's become one
sharing the love.

119
00:16:56,645 --> 00:17:01,639
You are a king if
you've a loving heart.

120
00:17:22,305 --> 00:17:24,466
You are going to join
a new college. Be careful.

121
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,801
Call us on phone if you
face any problem.

122
00:17:28,311 --> 00:17:34,807
No...no...come down!
...come down.

123
00:17:59,842 --> 00:18:01,332
Our man is living his role.

124
00:18:15,525 --> 00:18:16,685
Tell him.

125
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,850
Tell him, I love you.

126
00:18:19,028 --> 00:18:20,859
Tell him...he may jump.
- Come on tell him.

127
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:29,938
Say it quickly...
- Say, I love you.

128
00:18:35,044 --> 00:18:36,204
Say it loudly.

129
00:19:45,615 --> 00:19:51,281
I've found some one.
I've found a girl.

130
00:19:53,789 --> 00:19:55,689
A chocolate and three stones

131
00:19:58,127 --> 00:20:00,459
A friend I don't know.
What's your name?

132
00:20:03,466 --> 00:20:04,364
Where shall we meet again?

133
00:20:06,469 --> 00:20:07,367
I got it.

134
00:20:08,304 --> 00:20:10,363
This time also I'm sure to
win the track events.

135
00:20:10,806 --> 00:20:11,966
It seems you are going
to Delhi. - Yes.

136
00:20:12,808 --> 00:20:13,968
Sorry, I'm getting late
to the practical class.

137
00:20:14,143 --> 00:20:15,303
Or else I would've come to
see you off at airport.

138
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,242
What?

139
00:20:18,648 --> 00:20:20,138
I'm leaving to airport
in 10 minutes.

140
00:20:20,316 --> 00:20:21,977
Come to the airport with luggage.

141
00:20:22,485 --> 00:20:24,043
A party so early?
Useless fellow!

142
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:25,309
What?

143
00:20:40,503 --> 00:20:42,164
Do you know him?
That too he's saying in front of me.

144
00:20:42,338 --> 00:20:45,171
Stop man...I'll kill you.
Dares to say he loves you in front of me...

145
00:20:45,341 --> 00:20:47,502
Tell me, who is he?
- Boys...come here.

146
00:20:49,845 --> 00:20:50,334
What happened?

147
00:20:50,513 --> 00:20:52,003
That guy just said 'l love you'
to Geetha & left.

148
00:20:52,682 --> 00:20:53,512
I want his details.

149
00:20:53,683 --> 00:20:55,844
We'll find out. Get going, you're
getting late to your flight.

150
00:20:56,018 --> 00:20:56,507
I want immediately.

151
00:20:56,686 --> 00:20:59,348
You leave now.
- I'll take care...you go.

152
00:20:59,855 --> 00:21:00,844
Go...

153
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:05,850
Who is he? New Student?

154
00:21:07,196 --> 00:21:08,857
How dare he says I love you to...

155
00:21:28,216 --> 00:21:31,549
This flower has been blessed by
the touch of my lover's hand.

156
00:21:47,235 --> 00:21:49,726
Anyone of these 3 stones
falling into that cup...

157
00:21:49,904 --> 00:21:50,563
...my love will be a success.

158
00:21:52,073 --> 00:21:52,801
...or else...no!

159
00:22:24,773 --> 00:22:26,934
Oh no! This game is cancelled.
Let's play it again.

160
00:22:41,456 --> 00:22:43,515
Did he express his love
in Ajay's presence?

161
00:22:44,292 --> 00:22:46,283
Yes, do you know how
tensed I was?

162
00:22:46,461 --> 00:22:49,953
May be he doesn't know about you.
- No, he did it purposely.

163
00:22:52,634 --> 00:22:54,124
Why don't you introduce
him to me?

164
00:22:54,302 --> 00:22:56,065
I'm getting bored with life
without a boy friend.

165
00:22:56,638 --> 00:22:58,128
How does he look?
Is he handsome?

166
00:22:58,306 --> 00:23:00,797
What handsome?
If I see him again...

167
00:23:00,975 --> 00:23:01,805
I'm fine.

168
00:23:15,657 --> 00:23:16,885
Playing fun with me?

169
00:23:18,326 --> 00:23:20,317
The man with me
yesterday was Ajay...

170
00:23:20,495 --> 00:23:22,759
I know. You love him
and I love you.

171
00:23:22,997 --> 00:23:24,658
Are you doing this
knowing everything?

172
00:23:24,833 --> 00:23:26,664
If you love some one,
should I stop loving you?

173
00:23:26,835 --> 00:23:28,996
How can it be love if I give up
so easily? Isn't it?

174
00:23:29,337 --> 00:23:30,668
Why should you love me?

175
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:33,000
What's that question?
Love is life.

176
00:23:33,174 --> 00:23:36,007
A foolish man threatened to jump
and you said I love you.

177
00:23:36,177 --> 00:23:37,838
What other thing do I need to
fall in love with you?

178
00:23:38,012 --> 00:23:39,343
What do you want from me?

179
00:23:40,014 --> 00:23:44,508
You don't need to love me.
Just feel my love. That's it.

180
00:23:44,686 --> 00:23:47,780
I hate extroverts like you.

181
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:57,020
Why hasn't he come yet?

182
00:23:57,365 --> 00:24:00,198
Success!
My love is a grand success.

183
00:24:00,368 --> 00:24:04,202
Take chocolates

184
00:24:04,372 --> 00:24:06,363
Do you know what did
Geetha say to me?

185
00:24:06,541 --> 00:24:07,530
Did she say, I love you?

186
00:24:10,044 --> 00:24:11,477
What?

187
00:24:11,713 --> 00:24:15,410
Yes, Geetha said, 'l hate you'.
True.

188
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:18,814
Distributing chocolates for
saying, I hate you?

189
00:24:19,721 --> 00:24:21,279
Boy, tell him.

190
00:24:21,556 --> 00:24:23,717
Do you know the meaning
of 'l hate you'?

191
00:24:24,058 --> 00:24:25,719
She said she dislikes you.

192
00:24:30,565 --> 00:24:33,728
Something is better
than nothing, isn't it?

193
00:24:39,741 --> 00:24:41,902
Love or hatred is in heart.

194
00:24:42,744 --> 00:24:45,736
That means, I'm in Geetha's
heart, isn't it?

195
00:24:47,248 --> 00:24:49,239
I'm getting to understand
him clearly now.

196
00:24:49,417 --> 00:24:51,510
That's what we are also
not able to understand.

197
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:55,183
To my dearest Geethanjali
...3 dots!

198
00:24:55,423 --> 00:24:57,914
...yesterday you took
a flower from me...

199
00:25:02,263 --> 00:25:05,198
I'm in blue ink and
from red ink Arya.

200
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,591
Geetha is serious,
so we too are serious.

201
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:10,499
So tomorrow we're warning Arya

202
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:19,273
To my dearest Geethanjali,
...3 dots!

203
00:25:19,781 --> 00:25:23,012
Yesterday you took
a flower from me.

204
00:25:23,451 --> 00:25:26,477
Today you are making me
write a love letter! Full stop.

205
00:25:26,788 --> 00:25:30,451
It's question mark about
what's in store for the future?

206
00:25:30,792 --> 00:25:33,488
Just feel my love...
that's all...Underline.

207
00:25:33,795 --> 00:25:37,356
Don't bother about friends'
comments in brackets.

208
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:40,233
Bye in blue ink,
from Arya in red ink.

209
00:25:42,637 --> 00:25:43,626
Are you itching for trouble?
- No.

210
00:25:43,805 --> 00:25:46,467
Will you give a love letter
on seeing a girl? - Yes.

211
00:25:46,641 --> 00:25:48,802
What? Are you in love
with Geetha?

212
00:25:49,143 --> 00:25:50,906
But you don't want
Geetha to love you?

213
00:25:51,312 --> 00:25:52,973
That's it, Shanthi.
Give and take is business.

214
00:25:53,147 --> 00:25:55,138
If I insist Geetha should
love me as I love her...

215
00:25:55,316 --> 00:25:56,715
...will become business.
How can it be love?

216
00:25:57,151 --> 00:25:59,915
Well said!

217
00:26:01,656 --> 00:26:03,317
If your love for her is true...

218
00:26:03,825 --> 00:26:06,726
Love is truth; so asking about
true love is wrong question.

219
00:26:07,161 --> 00:26:08,150
You love her, that's okay.

220
00:26:08,329 --> 00:26:10,490
Can't you keep it within your heart?
Why are you expressing it openly?

221
00:26:17,005 --> 00:26:17,835
Caught on wrong foot.

222
00:26:18,506 --> 00:26:19,495
Come again.

223
00:26:19,674 --> 00:26:21,164
If you love her, why can't you
keep it to yourself?

224
00:26:21,342 --> 00:26:22,172
Why are you expressing it?

225
00:26:22,343 --> 00:26:24,675
No dear, if it's very
little I can hide it.

226
00:26:24,846 --> 00:26:26,336
How can I hide so much love?

227
00:26:26,514 --> 00:26:28,846
My love for her is so vast
that I can't hide it.

228
00:26:34,856 --> 00:26:35,515
I'm an extrovert.

229
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:37,521
Suppose if you laugh...
- If I laugh?

230
00:26:37,692 --> 00:26:38,624
You look terrible.

231
00:26:40,862 --> 00:26:44,025
Ajay already loves her.
Why do you want to love her again?

232
00:26:44,532 --> 00:26:46,193
Do you like Taj Mahal?
- I like.

233
00:26:46,367 --> 00:26:48,096
You? - I too like.

234
00:26:48,703 --> 00:26:50,102
That girl likes it,
so you stop hiking it.

235
00:26:55,209 --> 00:26:56,369
Stop! Did you ever fall
in love with anyone?

236
00:26:56,544 --> 00:26:57,203
No

237
00:26:57,378 --> 00:26:58,868
You are unqualified to put questions.
Sit down.

238
00:26:59,047 --> 00:26:59,638
Sit down.

239
00:27:04,217 --> 00:27:08,244
Dear girls! Stop asking
questions and start loving.

240
00:27:08,555 --> 00:27:09,886
You'll never get any doubts.

241
00:27:11,892 --> 00:27:12,790
Come girls, let's go.

242
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:25,595
He has given a letter to Shanthi.
- Love letter?

243
00:27:27,574 --> 00:27:31,010
To my dearest hating Shanthi.
I hate you.

244
00:27:31,244 --> 00:27:33,405
I started hating you ever since
I saw you first.

245
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,411
I can live happily without you.

246
00:27:35,582 --> 00:27:37,812
From, yours ever hating Arya.

247
00:27:38,418 --> 00:27:40,750
Note: Please don't come
to HUDA Park tomorrow.

248
00:27:56,603 --> 00:27:57,695
Any feelings?

249
00:28:06,446 --> 00:28:07,777
Did you feel my love?

250
00:28:10,951 --> 00:28:11,781
Didn't feel?

251
00:28:28,635 --> 00:28:30,125
What's your problem?
Come on tell me.

252
00:28:30,303 --> 00:28:32,533
I just want to know
if you'd felt my love or not.

253
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:34,801
Didn't feel anything?
- No.

254
00:28:34,975 --> 00:28:36,135
Not even a little?

255
00:28:36,476 --> 00:28:37,306
Didn't feel anything?

256
00:28:37,644 --> 00:28:40,135
Don't you've any responsibility
towards your lover?

257
00:28:40,313 --> 00:28:42,144
Is one-sided love
so cheap to you?

258
00:28:42,315 --> 00:28:43,475
Look...you are...
- Am I handsome?

259
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:44,480
...you are disturbing
me very much.

260
00:28:44,651 --> 00:28:46,141
When I think about you....
- Did you think about me?

261
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:49,311
I get irritated.
Are you mad? What feel...?

262
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,992
You reacted when I said cockroach.

263
00:28:56,163 --> 00:28:58,495
Why can't you react a little
for my love?

264
00:28:59,499 --> 00:29:01,694
I've only one feeling
for you...hatred.

265
00:29:02,669 --> 00:29:04,000
I hate you.

266
00:29:04,171 --> 00:29:06,833
You love to hate me, don't you?
- I love.

267
00:29:07,007 --> 00:29:09,999
Then, why do you say it
with a frowning face?

268
00:29:10,177 --> 00:29:11,838
Can't you say it with a smile?

269
00:29:23,857 --> 00:29:24,687
I'm fine.

270
00:29:25,192 --> 00:29:27,683
Your face shows you've
hated me today also.

271
00:29:28,028 --> 00:29:29,586
Okay, come let's go
and have a coffee.

272
00:29:30,363 --> 00:29:32,854
You can hate me over
a coffee also.

273
00:29:54,221 --> 00:29:55,711
Please don't disturb her,
she's hating me.

274
00:29:56,389 --> 00:29:57,947
You carry on please.

275
00:29:58,725 --> 00:30:01,558
Look...you smiled now.
- No, I didn't.

276
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:05,061
No, accept you smiled now.
You smiled and I saw it.

277
00:30:05,232 --> 00:30:06,563
Okay, I smiled. So what?

278
00:30:06,733 --> 00:30:08,223
That means you've started
feeling my love.

279
00:30:08,401 --> 00:30:10,892
What are you saying?
Don't you've any sense?

280
00:30:11,071 --> 00:30:12,902
It was my mistake to come
with you for a coffee.

281
00:30:13,073 --> 00:30:16,406
Why are you confused?
You don't love me. You hate me, okay?

282
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:18,567
Why can't you be sincere in that?
Why are you smiling at me?

283
00:30:18,745 --> 00:30:20,406
Okay, give him Rs.50.
He'll go away.

284
00:30:20,747 --> 00:30:22,977
Why am I putting up with you?

285
00:30:23,416 --> 00:30:26,749
There are so many girls
in this college.

286
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,753
Why should you love only
me and not others?

287
00:30:29,923 --> 00:30:32,414
Yes, why am I in love with
you and not others?

288
00:30:32,592 --> 00:30:33,422
Let me ask them.

289
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,923
Why am I in love with her & not you?
Any defect in you?

290
00:30:38,598 --> 00:30:40,589
Why am I in love with
her & not you?

291
00:30:40,767 --> 00:30:42,598
Any defect in you?
- Mad man.

292
00:30:43,436 --> 00:30:45,267
Why am I in love with her
and not you?

293
00:30:45,438 --> 00:30:46,530
Any defect in you?

294
00:30:48,608 --> 00:30:50,599
Sorry! I asked all the girls here
and there's no response.

295
00:30:50,777 --> 00:30:52,267
You've to feel my love.

296
00:30:52,445 --> 00:30:54,675
If you really feel my love,
I'll come in your dream.

297
00:32:11,824 --> 00:32:13,985
Feel my love with anger...

298
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,321
or with hatred...

299
00:32:16,496 --> 00:32:20,660
...or feel my love like
a curse, my love.

300
00:32:21,167 --> 00:32:23,601
Feel my love like a burden...

301
00:32:23,836 --> 00:32:25,997
or far away...

302
00:32:26,172 --> 00:32:30,165
...my love, feel it as a crime.

303
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:33,274
Feel my love silently...

304
00:32:33,346 --> 00:32:35,507
or as mean...

305
00:32:35,682 --> 00:32:40,414
Feel my love as void
or something as or not.

306
00:32:47,693 --> 00:32:52,357
Feel my love tearing all the
love letters I sent you.

307
00:33:52,591 --> 00:33:56,823
Feel my love throwing the
flowers I sent you.

308
00:33:57,596 --> 00:34:02,090
Feel my love booing the
love poems I recite.

309
00:34:02,267 --> 00:34:06,431
Feel my love if you are
disgusted with my mischief.

310
00:34:06,938 --> 00:34:09,429
Saying you don't like
my presence.

311
00:34:09,608 --> 00:34:11,769
...claiming you never
think about me,

312
00:34:11,943 --> 00:34:15,936
...that you hate me and
thoughts about me are bitter.

313
00:34:16,615 --> 00:34:21,450
...thinking you'll never become
life partner...feel my love.

314
00:35:21,513 --> 00:35:26,177
Feel my love turning your
eyes red with anger.

315
00:35:26,351 --> 00:35:30,788
Feel my love abusing me wildly.

316
00:35:31,356 --> 00:35:35,850
Feel my love wiping me
away like dust.

317
00:35:36,027 --> 00:35:40,521
Feel my love in the foot marks
left behind while leaving you.

318
00:35:40,866 --> 00:35:45,360
If legs get tired and
burden on hands increases.

319
00:35:45,704 --> 00:35:50,198
If eyes feel sleepy and
lips stop uttering words.

320
00:35:50,375 --> 00:35:55,142
Above all this if you've a heart,
feel my love.

321
00:36:35,853 --> 00:36:38,014
He's going over the board. - Yes.

322
00:38:38,141 --> 00:38:40,041
Tell him.
- He's over doing everything.

323
00:38:42,145 --> 00:38:43,976
Entire college is behind him.

324
00:38:44,147 --> 00:38:45,580
Even girls are supporting him.

325
00:38:46,316 --> 00:38:49,308
He's chasing Geetha.
She too is...

326
00:38:49,486 --> 00:38:52,319
No brother, he can make any girl
fall in love with him.

327
00:38:52,489 --> 00:38:53,649
He's extremely talented.

328
00:38:53,824 --> 00:38:56,156
He never beats us, but breaks
everything surrounding him.

329
00:38:56,326 --> 00:38:58,385
He'll kill us psychologically.

330
00:38:59,162 --> 00:39:02,825
You must do something
or else you'll lose Geetha.

331
00:39:11,007 --> 00:39:12,167
Where's Arya?
- I don't know.

332
00:39:14,678 --> 00:39:15,872
Where's Arya?

333
00:39:17,013 --> 00:39:18,002
Boy...here!

334
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:27,012
I saw you on my entry and
after a long time now.

335
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:35,691
Didn't I say he's powerful?

336
00:39:37,868 --> 00:39:39,699
What man?
It seems you love Geetha.

337
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:41,428
Don't you want to live?
Do you know who am l?

338
00:39:44,207 --> 00:39:45,697
Let's fight...Iet's fight
it out definitely.

339
00:39:45,876 --> 00:39:47,969
But, tell me one thing.
Do you love Geetha?

340
00:39:48,211 --> 00:39:50,873
He loves her. That's why,
we've come to stop you.

341
00:39:51,381 --> 00:39:52,541
Does Geetha love you?
- Hey, tell him.

342
00:39:52,716 --> 00:39:54,377
Are you mad?

343
00:39:54,551 --> 00:39:56,712
She said she loves him from roof top.
Didn't you hear it?

344
00:39:56,887 --> 00:39:59,549
Then, it's all over.

345
00:39:59,723 --> 00:40:01,384
Why are you all leaving?

346
00:40:03,059 --> 00:40:04,458
Why are you over doing things?
- Me?

347
00:40:04,895 --> 00:40:06,226
Don't unnecessarily incite me.

348
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:08,391
If you want to continue
in this college,

349
00:40:09,065 --> 00:40:13,468
Don't talk or see Geetha.
Got it?

350
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:15,231
Why are you getting
tensed if I love her?

351
00:40:15,405 --> 00:40:16,463
My love for her is
my personal thing

352
00:40:17,574 --> 00:40:18,905
Are you afraid she
might fall for me?

353
00:40:19,242 --> 00:40:20,903
Is your love so weak?

354
00:40:21,244 --> 00:40:22,734
Don't you've confidence
in your love?

355
00:40:22,913 --> 00:40:25,279
Tell me if you don't have,
I'll drop out.

356
00:40:25,582 --> 00:40:27,573
He has full confidence
in his love.

357
00:40:27,918 --> 00:40:29,749
Look, if it is really love
between you both,

358
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,081
1000 people like me also
can't separate you.

359
00:40:32,255 --> 00:40:33,415
If she falls for my love,

360
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:34,682
then, yours is not love.

361
00:40:35,258 --> 00:40:37,419
Calling love, what isn't really
love is meaningless.

362
00:40:37,594 --> 00:40:39,425
He's confusing me.
- Well said, didn't he?

363
00:40:41,431 --> 00:40:43,592
What's this carrying bats?

364
00:40:44,601 --> 00:40:46,364
To beat me?

365
00:40:46,603 --> 00:40:49,265
If you beat me once also,

366
00:40:50,273 --> 00:40:51,763
it means you don't have
confidence in your love.

367
00:40:51,942 --> 00:40:53,603
If you say no, I'll drop out.

368
00:40:53,777 --> 00:40:55,938
Why are you always saying
about dropping out?

369
00:40:56,112 --> 00:40:57,773
Impossible.
You must continue.

370
00:40:57,948 --> 00:41:01,281
Hey, you stop man!
He's confident about his love.

371
00:41:01,451 --> 00:41:02,440
If you are really confident...

372
00:41:02,619 --> 00:41:05,452
...accept with a smile whatever I do.
- He'll do it.

373
00:41:05,622 --> 00:41:07,112
Why are you afraid of him?

374
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:09,622
What's his range?
He's the king of this college.

375
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:14,795
His word is a promise.
Brother, come let's go.

376
00:41:14,965 --> 00:41:16,796
Why are you getting angry?
I'm here.

377
00:41:17,634 --> 00:41:20,125
Going to Library?
- Yes, so what?

378
00:41:20,303 --> 00:41:21,793
Tell Geetha, I'll meet
her in the evening.

379
00:41:22,138 --> 00:41:24,971
He'll tell...come
brother, let's go.

380
00:41:25,308 --> 00:41:29,335
I'm telling you once again,
he has confidence in his love.

381
00:41:29,646 --> 00:41:31,546
Go...go...I'll take care of him.

382
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:37,548
Mother!

383
00:41:38,989 --> 00:41:41,150
Tell me mother.
- How are you dear?

384
00:41:41,324 --> 00:41:44,316
Just light fever, that's all.
- Did you consult a doctor?

385
00:41:44,494 --> 00:41:45,654
I'm under treatment, mother.

386
00:41:45,829 --> 00:41:47,820
Take medicines properly.
- Okay?

387
00:41:47,998 --> 00:41:50,558
Can't you come home?
- No, exams are nearing.

388
00:41:51,167 --> 00:41:52,498
Aren't we here?
We'll take care of her, aunt.

389
00:41:52,669 --> 00:41:54,830
Take care of her.
- Okay...bye.

390
00:41:55,338 --> 00:41:56,236
Come.

391
00:42:01,011 --> 00:42:02,842
Is it to develop or shed?

392
00:42:06,683 --> 00:42:07,342
Like it man.

393
00:42:11,021 --> 00:42:11,680
All right

394
00:42:13,857 --> 00:42:16,451
It seems Geetha is having fever,
her friend called up.

395
00:42:17,027 --> 00:42:18,016
I'll go to her hostel.

396
00:42:29,539 --> 00:42:31,530
Going to hostel?
I'll also come along with you.

397
00:42:31,708 --> 00:42:32,868
It's 2 days since
I've seen Geetha.

398
00:42:33,043 --> 00:42:34,032
It seems Geetha is not
feeling well.

399
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:35,802
Come, let's go and inquire
about her welfare.

400
00:42:40,216 --> 00:42:43,083
Don't you've confidence?

401
00:42:43,386 --> 00:42:46,947
Brother, don't give in,
be confident.

402
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:56,631
I was thinking how to reach her.
Thank god, you gave me a lift.

403
00:43:01,404 --> 00:43:03,895
Why did you stop here?
To buy fruits?

404
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,901
Is it necessary now?

405
00:43:06,242 --> 00:43:09,075
Won't Geetha love you if
you don't take fruits?

406
00:43:09,245 --> 00:43:10,906
Okay, you've got your
own problems.

407
00:43:11,081 --> 00:43:14,073
Boy, pack 2 dozens of apples.
- No need.

408
00:43:16,086 --> 00:43:18,577
Geetha, your lovers have come.

409
00:43:34,771 --> 00:43:36,204
Okay, let's play again.

410
00:43:40,944 --> 00:43:42,605
Are you fine Geetha?
Has your fever come down?

411
00:43:42,779 --> 00:43:43,609
Did you take medicine properly?

412
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:45,270
Any way take 2 or 3
days of complete rest.

413
00:43:45,448 --> 00:43:46,779
Don't worry about
missing classes.

414
00:43:46,950 --> 00:43:47,939
I'll take down notes for you.

415
00:43:48,118 --> 00:43:50,143
Why are you still standing?
Come and sit.

416
00:43:52,455 --> 00:43:53,353
Am I talking too much?

417
00:43:57,793 --> 00:44:00,023
Good...very good!

418
00:44:01,463 --> 00:44:04,227
Great lovers!
Walked in empty handed.

419
00:44:04,466 --> 00:44:05,626
She's not feeling well.

420
00:44:05,801 --> 00:44:07,632
Don't you've common sense
to bring fruits for her?

421
00:44:07,803 --> 00:44:08,792
I've brought Shanthi.

422
00:44:28,824 --> 00:44:31,657
Will you cheat me?
- Cheated you?

423
00:44:31,827 --> 00:44:33,658
Bringing or not bringing
is your personal affair

424
00:44:33,829 --> 00:44:37,321
Will you stop if I say?
Do I've to tell you all this?

425
00:44:37,499 --> 00:44:40,832
Come on girls...Ieave them alone.
You both talk to each other.

426
00:44:41,003 --> 00:44:44,336
Ajay talk to Geetha.
Girls, let's go out and play.

427
00:44:45,841 --> 00:44:46,671
Where are you coming?

428
00:44:46,842 --> 00:44:48,935
Take the fruits make juice
and serve it to Geetha.

429
00:44:50,846 --> 00:44:52,006
It all happened because of you.

430
00:44:52,181 --> 00:44:54,342
You went out with
him and had coffee.

431
00:44:54,516 --> 00:44:56,177
If you'd stopped him then, situation
wouldn't have come to this.

432
00:44:56,852 --> 00:44:58,183
He came along with me now.

433
00:44:58,353 --> 00:44:59,513
If I warn, he asks if l
don't have confidence.

434
00:44:59,855 --> 00:45:00,685
I'm going mad.

435
00:45:00,856 --> 00:45:02,187
Why don't you try to
understand me?

436
00:45:02,357 --> 00:45:03,517
Why are you friendly with him?

437
00:45:06,862 --> 00:45:08,523
I'm getting fooled in front
of my friends too.

438
00:45:08,697 --> 00:45:10,358
It'll be difficult if this continues.
This shouldn't repeat again.

439
00:45:10,532 --> 00:45:12,090
Don't let it happen again
and embarrass me.

440
00:45:31,887 --> 00:45:33,047
This time I'm serious.

441
00:45:33,222 --> 00:45:35,213
Anyone of 3 stones falling into it.
My love will succeed.

442
00:45:35,390 --> 00:45:36,220
or else no!

443
00:45:37,559 --> 00:45:39,220
One minute! - What?

444
00:46:13,095 --> 00:46:14,756
One suggestion! - What?

445
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:15,919
Any way it's not
falling into it.

446
00:46:16,098 --> 00:46:17,759
If you say love will succeed
if you fail to put into it.

447
00:46:17,933 --> 00:46:19,264
This is good idea!

448
00:46:33,949 --> 00:46:40,377
Stop...

449
00:46:43,125 --> 00:46:47,118
It's difficult boss.
Every time the opposite happens.

450
00:46:47,296 --> 00:46:48,786
Your love will never succeed.

451
00:46:49,965 --> 00:46:51,455
You know one thing. - What?

452
00:46:51,633 --> 00:46:53,965
I never believe such things.
I'll believe if it falls.

453
00:46:54,303 --> 00:46:58,205
Oh Gods!

454
00:46:59,141 --> 00:47:00,472
We are not able to meet
because of Arya.

455
00:47:00,642 --> 00:47:02,803
You are also avoiding me
saying you've classes.

456
00:47:03,812 --> 00:47:04,801
That's why, I called you
to the park.

457
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:06,311
No one will disturb us here.

458
00:47:10,986 --> 00:47:13,147
Correct boss! No one will
disturb us here.

459
00:47:13,322 --> 00:47:14,152
Come on take this.

460
00:47:22,164 --> 00:47:24,826
Why are you disturbing us?
- Me?

461
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:25,830
Isn't this disturbance?

462
00:47:26,001 --> 00:47:28,162
Nobody can disturb
love or lovers.

463
00:47:28,337 --> 00:47:29,497
If they are disturbed
then it's not love at all.

464
00:47:29,671 --> 00:47:32,902
Love is a penance.
a penance by 2 people.

465
00:47:33,342 --> 00:47:35,333
Lovers must forget
their surroundings.

466
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:37,171
They must forget this world.

467
00:47:37,346 --> 00:47:39,177
You both still don't
know to love.

468
00:47:39,348 --> 00:47:41,908
Please come nearer.
Look into each other's eyes.

469
00:47:44,353 --> 00:47:46,685
World is slowly disappearing
from your eyes.

470
00:47:46,855 --> 00:47:49,517
You can't hear or see anything.

471
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:53,351
You are not hearing that
flight's noise also.

472
00:47:54,196 --> 00:47:55,925
Now you are looking into each other.

473
00:47:56,698 --> 00:47:58,188
For present, you both
are not here.

474
00:47:59,034 --> 00:48:00,592
Why did they go away?

475
00:48:02,371 --> 00:48:04,532
When Ajay is not here,
I'm the boss.

476
00:48:04,706 --> 00:48:05,866
Why are you leading?

477
00:48:12,714 --> 00:48:13,703
She's mine.

478
00:49:11,106 --> 00:49:13,336
Can't you see properly?
Bloody idiot.

479
00:49:27,956 --> 00:49:28,547
Get lost.

480
00:49:31,793 --> 00:49:34,625
If you say yes,
I'll fall for you easily.

481
00:49:34,795 --> 00:49:38,128
I want a girl friend...
Be careful.

482
00:49:38,299 --> 00:49:41,700
I want a girl friend.

483
00:49:41,969 --> 00:49:43,493
Please arrange one like
this for me too.

484
00:49:55,316 --> 00:49:55,975
What happened?

485
00:49:56,150 --> 00:49:57,913
He's here only.
He'll eat my brain.

486
00:49:58,152 --> 00:49:59,813
Why do you look at him
like an enemy?

487
00:49:59,987 --> 00:50:03,252
He's not such a bad guy.
He's little extrovert. That's it.

488
00:50:03,491 --> 00:50:06,927
He can be friendly with you and
create problems, can't he?

489
00:50:07,161 --> 00:50:09,152
There are many who behave
negatively for love.

490
00:50:09,330 --> 00:50:10,661
He wants to be friendly with you.

491
00:50:10,831 --> 00:50:11,490
What's wrong in it?

492
00:50:15,836 --> 00:50:16,666
I'm meeting you after
a long time.

493
00:50:16,837 --> 00:50:18,828
Didn't I say, I'll meet you
with my girl friend only?

494
00:50:21,509 --> 00:50:22,339
How is she?

495
00:50:22,510 --> 00:50:23,340
Why are you going away?

496
00:50:23,511 --> 00:50:25,001
That guy is here only.- Who?
That Arya.

497
00:50:25,179 --> 00:50:27,340
Oh! That one side lover, Arya!

498
00:50:27,515 --> 00:50:28,948
Are you afraid of him?
Come with me.

499
00:50:29,350 --> 00:50:30,009
He's a disturbance.

500
00:50:30,184 --> 00:50:34,177
We must disturb others.
Never allow others to disturb us.

501
00:50:35,189 --> 00:50:37,350
Do one thing,
you go & disturb him.

502
00:50:38,025 --> 00:50:40,016
What are you looking at?
I wasn't here all these days.

503
00:50:40,194 --> 00:50:42,185
Now that I'm here,
no one can disturb you.

504
00:50:42,363 --> 00:50:44,354
You go ahead.
I'll take care of him.

505
00:50:49,870 --> 00:50:51,770
You're saying hello to me!

506
00:50:53,207 --> 00:50:55,698
Did I disturb you?
- Disturbing me? No way.

507
00:50:55,876 --> 00:50:57,434
We must always be
like this only.

508
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:00,438
You brought Geetha here for me.

509
00:51:01,215 --> 00:51:02,204
Oh! I forgot to wish you...

510
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:08,051
They'll disturb here.

511
00:51:08,222 --> 00:51:10,315
Let's do one thing.
Let's run away from here.

512
00:51:10,558 --> 00:51:11,923
Let's love each other
doing nothing else.

513
00:51:13,894 --> 00:51:15,794
Do you know,
we have come together.

514
00:51:17,064 --> 00:51:18,725
Have a seat.
- Don't know.

515
00:51:25,739 --> 00:51:27,138
Ajay, come here for a minute.

516
00:51:35,749 --> 00:51:38,912
You sit next to her always.
I'll sit once.

517
00:51:43,424 --> 00:51:44,356
What happened?

518
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:47,352
Geetha, sit down.

519
00:51:52,433 --> 00:51:54,833
On this happy occasion, ice creams
for everyone from me.

520
00:51:59,607 --> 00:52:00,505
Me too strawberry!

521
00:52:07,114 --> 00:52:08,172
Then, chocolate for me too!

522
00:52:11,285 --> 00:52:13,116
Vanilla? You love
chocolate, don't you?

523
00:52:13,287 --> 00:52:15,118
I've changed my opinion.
- Just like this.

524
00:52:15,289 --> 00:52:17,621
You can change your opinion
about me, can't you?

525
00:52:22,129 --> 00:52:25,292
Okay, let him feel happy,
anyway he's a love failure.

526
00:52:25,466 --> 00:52:26,626
Did I give him a nasty punch?
- Yes.

527
00:52:26,967 --> 00:52:28,798
You don't get tensed up.

528
00:52:28,969 --> 00:52:30,197
Catch any one of
these two fingers.

529
00:52:31,805 --> 00:52:32,294
Stop!

530
00:52:40,648 --> 00:52:42,741
I like your frankness.
You must catch it.

531
00:52:43,984 --> 00:52:46,316
My love will be a success.

532
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:49,482
What great success?
Your love is born failure.

533
00:52:49,657 --> 00:52:50,988
You love a girl who
loves another man.

534
00:52:51,158 --> 00:52:53,149
How can your love be successful?
- Why not?

535
00:52:54,495 --> 00:52:56,326
They can split up, can't they?

536
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:01,491
Yes, so many lovers have split.

537
00:53:01,669 --> 00:53:02,658
This is Valentine's day.

538
00:53:02,836 --> 00:53:05,100
Look, how many couples
are celebrating here.

539
00:53:05,506 --> 00:53:08,998
There's no guarantee they'll be
here next year with same lover.

540
00:53:09,677 --> 00:53:11,167
For example, you came with
Rani last year.

541
00:53:11,345 --> 00:53:12,334
Now, you've came with
Rosy, haven't you?

542
00:53:13,013 --> 00:53:15,573
It's a lie.
Don't believe him.

543
00:53:16,684 --> 00:53:18,345
Where did he come from
to spoil my love?

544
00:53:18,519 --> 00:53:19,178
Ajay, beware of him.

545
00:53:19,353 --> 00:53:23,016
You supported him.
He's trying to split us.

546
00:53:24,024 --> 00:53:26,356
What's this?
Do you want them to split?

547
00:53:26,527 --> 00:53:27,516
Don't you've confidence in your lover?

548
00:53:27,695 --> 00:53:30,596
I've great confidence
in my love.

549
00:53:30,764 --> 00:53:31,526
Lovers will never split.

550
00:53:31,699 --> 00:53:34,532
But those who are infatuated
will split.

551
00:53:34,702 --> 00:53:36,363
May be they don't love
each other.

552
00:53:36,537 --> 00:53:37,868
May be it's just infatuation.

553
00:53:38,038 --> 00:53:41,701
Geetha would've told I love you to
any fool jumping from the roof.

554
00:53:43,043 --> 00:53:44,533
That's why, I said I didn't
want to speak to him.

555
00:53:45,379 --> 00:53:46,471
Talking to him is...

556
00:54:37,065 --> 00:54:39,056
...you know I'm mad
about you.

557
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:46,302
I can do anything for you.

558
00:54:47,575 --> 00:54:50,305
Come and watch.

559
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:54,446
What's destined to happen will
happen at any cost.

560
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:57,510
wake up...Iisten to me.

561
00:54:58,419 --> 00:55:01,786
Where there's a will
there are plenty of ways.

562
00:55:56,143 --> 00:55:59,476
Love is a sweet melody
striking your heart.

563
00:55:59,813 --> 00:56:06,651
Nobody can say when and how
love will spell it's magic.

564
00:56:07,154 --> 00:56:09,714
Dance and celebrate.

565
00:56:10,824 --> 00:56:13,987
If you fall in love, your heart
becomes mischievous.

566
00:56:14,161 --> 00:56:16,994
Oh my love realize!

567
00:56:17,998 --> 00:56:21,263
There's no greater power
on earth than love.

568
00:57:22,896 --> 00:57:26,059
Why do you ignore my
hand of friendship?

569
00:57:26,566 --> 00:57:27,726
with your presence...

570
00:57:28,402 --> 00:57:33,271
you've created a sensation
in my heart.

571
00:57:33,907 --> 00:57:36,569
whether you agree or disagree,

572
00:57:37,411 --> 00:57:40,608
you are in my heart.
That's true, my dear.

573
00:57:40,914 --> 00:57:43,747
In hot sun or
a heavy downpour...

574
00:57:44,584 --> 00:57:47,951
I'm always with you, my dear.

575
00:58:23,924 --> 00:58:25,915
Today is my Geethanjali's birthday.

576
00:58:26,259 --> 00:58:28,921
All of you please
wish her, from Arya

577
00:58:39,439 --> 00:58:42,101
What are you waiting for?
Cut the cake quickly.

578
00:58:42,275 --> 00:58:44,937
Taste may also change,
cut it quickly.

579
00:58:45,111 --> 00:58:47,443
Your next birthday may come
before you cut this cake.

580
00:58:47,614 --> 00:58:49,445
Will you cut or shall l?

581
00:58:49,616 --> 00:58:54,280
Come on, cut.

582
00:59:55,515 --> 00:59:57,506
Geetha, cut the cake.

583
01:00:21,541 --> 01:00:23,941
What man? Was Geetha's birthday
celebrated grandly?

584
01:00:26,379 --> 01:00:27,937
Geetha is coming.
Cool down brother.

585
01:00:29,716 --> 01:00:30,546
What happened?

586
01:00:32,719 --> 01:00:34,880
Why didn't you come to
my birthday celebration?

587
01:00:35,055 --> 01:00:36,420
I was waiting for you,
you know that?

588
01:00:36,890 --> 01:00:38,050
Why didn't you come?

589
01:00:38,391 --> 01:00:40,291
Did your celebration
stop without me?

590
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:41,549
People you love were there.

591
01:00:42,562 --> 01:00:45,622
Love? Oh you mean Arya?

592
01:00:47,233 --> 01:00:48,893
Do you know what was his gift?

593
01:00:54,073 --> 01:00:55,768
What's this he has
given you a shock?

594
01:00:56,241 --> 01:00:58,505
He presented your photo to
trap your girl friend.

595
01:00:58,744 --> 01:01:00,075
He's no ordinary man.

596
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:02,638
You didn't expect this, did you?

597
01:01:03,248 --> 01:01:07,981
If he really wanted us to split.
Why would he give this gift?

598
01:01:08,253 --> 01:01:10,653
You've mistaken Arya.

599
01:01:11,090 --> 01:01:13,991
He wants to be friendly with us.
That's all.

600
01:01:20,265 --> 01:01:24,599
What boss? How is my gift?
Is it good? Nothing...

601
01:01:24,770 --> 01:01:26,601
She'll feel happy for your photo,
so, I gave your photo.

602
01:01:26,772 --> 01:01:28,933
I'll give my photo if she'll be
happy with my photo.

603
01:01:29,108 --> 01:01:30,097
It's not about your
photo or mine.

604
01:01:30,275 --> 01:01:31,674
Our lover must be happy.
That's all!

605
01:01:32,444 --> 01:01:34,207
Well said, didn't he?
- I'll kill you.

606
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:37,772
Why do you smoke cigarettes?
You'll spoil your health.

607
01:01:37,950 --> 01:01:39,440
My lover loves you.

608
01:01:39,618 --> 01:01:41,449
Don't spoil your health by
smoking cigarettes.

609
01:01:41,620 --> 01:01:43,110
Do exercise and
take fruit juices.

610
01:01:43,455 --> 01:01:45,286
I love Geetha and
Geetha loves you.

611
01:01:45,457 --> 01:01:46,788
So, I too love you.

612
01:01:47,126 --> 01:01:49,890
We can't handle him.
Your dad is the right man.

613
01:01:50,629 --> 01:01:52,221
We must get that
tender this year too.

614
01:01:53,132 --> 01:01:54,463
No other person must bid for it.

615
01:01:55,134 --> 01:01:59,969
Ensure two of our people guard
the tender box. Got it?

616
01:02:01,306 --> 01:02:02,637
If anyone tries to
bid for the tender,

617
01:02:02,808 --> 01:02:04,708
Ask Subbu to kill him

618
01:02:20,492 --> 01:02:21,823
What's the meeting going on here?

619
01:02:24,163 --> 01:02:24,822
What happened?

620
01:02:25,497 --> 01:02:26,987
You want money? - No.

621
01:02:30,002 --> 01:02:30,991
Any problem in college?

622
01:02:31,837 --> 01:02:33,532
What's it boy?
- Yes uncle.

623
01:02:50,522 --> 01:02:54,014
Subbu, they need your help...
...help them.

624
01:02:56,528 --> 01:02:59,088
Take care of tender also.

625
01:03:30,729 --> 01:03:34,563
SlLENCE PLEASE.

626
01:03:47,246 --> 01:03:49,077
Geetha, Ajay wants you
to come immediately.

627
01:04:32,791 --> 01:04:34,622
Geetha hugged me.

628
01:04:34,793 --> 01:04:37,193
She also kissed me...Arya.

629
01:05:18,837 --> 01:05:20,828
Arya really weaved a magic to
make Geetha fall in love.

630
01:05:21,006 --> 01:05:21,836
He's Arya.

631
01:05:22,341 --> 01:05:23,899
Anyway Geetha has great foresight!

632
01:05:24,343 --> 01:05:27,176
If she has 2, one will be
there if she misses one.

633
01:05:27,346 --> 01:05:28,677
Super!

634
01:05:29,014 --> 01:05:30,845
Brother, you said it's
a routine love tale.

635
01:05:31,016 --> 01:05:32,005
But there's a lot of variety

636
01:05:32,184 --> 01:05:35,176
Correct! This is shuttle cock love.
- What's that?

637
01:05:35,354 --> 01:05:38,687
A cock and 2 rackets.
- Double game?

638
01:05:38,857 --> 01:05:40,518
Why are you passing comments?

639
01:05:40,692 --> 01:05:42,683
Don't you want to live?
Get lost guys.

640
01:05:47,866 --> 01:05:50,357
Geetha...how was the first touch?

641
01:05:52,704 --> 01:05:53,693
Was it thrilling?

642
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:24,562
Just because of you...

643
01:06:25,237 --> 01:06:28,569
Today, I've become a
characterless girl in this college.

644
01:06:29,073 --> 01:06:32,304
You've a put my life
on notice board.

645
01:06:33,411 --> 01:06:36,244
Everyone is looking at
me like a prostitute.

646
01:06:40,418 --> 01:06:41,407
You are a maniac!

647
01:06:41,919 --> 01:06:44,183
You want to achieve me
at any cost.

648
01:06:47,591 --> 01:06:49,320
That's why you are
behaving like this

649
01:06:49,927 --> 01:06:51,451
But it is impossible.

650
01:06:52,096 --> 01:06:53,757
I don't know what had
happened till now.

651
01:06:54,432 --> 01:06:55,763
But, I'm telling you now.

652
01:06:56,267 --> 01:06:59,759
I'll love only Ajay.
I'll marry only Ajay.

653
01:07:00,104 --> 01:07:01,935
I'll prove ours is true love.

654
01:07:04,775 --> 01:07:07,938
I don't have any problems.
You are my biggest problem.

655
01:07:08,446 --> 01:07:10,676
I'll be happy if
you're not there.

656
01:07:15,453 --> 01:07:16,442
I'm your problem, am I not?

657
01:07:17,455 --> 01:07:19,013
You'll be happy without
me, won't you?

658
01:07:21,459 --> 01:07:22,949
I'll never show up my face
again in your life.

659
01:10:07,458 --> 01:10:10,450
Looks like a mad man...
- Yes...may be love mad.

660
01:10:10,628 --> 01:10:11,458
May be.

661
01:10:12,630 --> 01:10:16,122
This hospital is curing
my love's sweet hurt.

662
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:20,202
So, I hate this hospital, Arya.

663
01:11:46,056 --> 01:11:47,216
What happened last night
in discotheque?

664
01:11:47,391 --> 01:11:49,052
If you kiss any girl as you find,
will she keep quiet?

665
01:11:49,226 --> 01:11:50,386
She's my lover.

666
01:11:50,561 --> 01:11:51,619
That's why, did she
push you down?

667
01:11:52,129 --> 01:11:53,289
What are you blabbering?

668
01:11:54,231 --> 01:11:56,062
I'll kill you.

669
01:11:57,234 --> 01:11:58,758
You've to hold many people's
shirt like this.

670
01:11:59,069 --> 01:12:02,630
Not only me, no one here feels
you are Geetha's lover.

671
01:12:11,914 --> 01:12:13,575
What he said is true?

672
01:12:14,083 --> 01:12:16,244
Every one is college is suspecting
me because of Arya.

673
01:12:16,919 --> 01:12:19,183
They feel I'm forcing
Geetha to love me.

674
01:12:19,756 --> 01:12:21,189
And she doesn't behave
like my lover.

675
01:12:21,758 --> 01:12:22,520
But she must.

676
01:12:23,926 --> 01:12:25,587
Entire college must
believe she loves me.

677
01:12:26,262 --> 01:12:27,524
We must do something
to make them believe.

678
01:12:27,764 --> 01:12:29,095
I know what is to be done.

679
01:12:30,767 --> 01:12:32,928
Boys! Plan a tour.
