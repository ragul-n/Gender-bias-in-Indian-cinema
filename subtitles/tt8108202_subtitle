00:07:03,778 --> 00:07:07,028
Uncle...you start this charade
in every festival, don't you?

28
00:07:08,444 --> 00:07:10,653
Vicky, there's still time.

29
00:07:11,028 --> 00:07:12,778
But, this is no ordinary ink.

30
00:07:12,903 --> 00:07:17,528
These are crushed bones of a bat
mixed with the pee of a white crow.

31
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:19,236
That's how this ink is prepared.

32
00:07:19,403 --> 00:07:23,736
Uncle, sell these stories to
those who like reading Aesop's fables.

33
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:25,611
We're the modern generation.

34
00:07:26,653 --> 00:07:28,361
The entire city believes
in this ignorance.

35
00:07:28,444 --> 00:07:32,444
Vicky, any house that has
this ink outside their house...

36
00:07:32,528 --> 00:07:34,944
...will always be safe from 'Stree'.

37
00:07:35,028 --> 00:07:35,903
I see...

38
00:07:36,153 --> 00:07:38,069
Have you ever heard that the
Ambani's daughter was possessed?

39
00:07:38,736 --> 00:07:40,361
Or the Tatas or Birla's were haunted.

40
00:07:40,611 --> 00:07:42,111
I know she will come.

41
00:07:42,694 --> 00:07:44,903
Loosen your pockets
and let me finish writing.

42
00:07:45,069 --> 00:07:47,903
Uncle, don't forget
to write on our wall too.

43
00:07:48,444 --> 00:07:51,319
And listen, write it in bold.

44
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:55,569
Otherwise, she might not
read it and come right in.

45
00:07:56,069 --> 00:07:57,653
Yes, I will.

46
00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:00,278
Your mouth will end
up like that aunty.

47
00:08:04,444 --> 00:08:06,069
Close the gate, mister.

48
00:08:07,194 --> 00:08:08,361
Or the cow will barge in.

49
00:08:08,611 --> 00:08:10,111
I am the watchman as well.

50
00:08:10,486 --> 00:08:11,781
So you finally found
time to come home.

51
00:08:11,861 --> 00:08:12,694
What's the matter?

52
00:08:12,778 --> 00:08:15,111
- You should also come with me from tomorrow.
- I don't need to.

53
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:16,694
The sewing machine gives
me all the exercise I need.

54
00:08:16,778 --> 00:08:18,444
And, you don't need this either.

55
00:08:18,611 --> 00:08:20,153
Or soon you'll be
hanging from a hanger.

56
00:08:20,529 --> 00:08:21,528
Was that a joke?

57
00:08:21,694 --> 00:08:22,986
And you're trying to be wise.

58
00:08:23,486 --> 00:08:25,194
I'm already observing a fast
for the next four days.

59
00:08:25,278 --> 00:08:26,569
And, you're making me waste my energy.

60
00:08:26,865 --> 00:08:29,403
- Another fast?
- Focus on your job.

61
00:08:29,486 --> 00:08:32,109
Soon the ladies will queue up.

62
00:08:32,361 --> 00:08:36,111
I've told you before
stop taking alteration work.

63
00:08:36,361 --> 00:08:38,486
"Loosen the petticoat,
tighten my blouse."

64
00:08:38,778 --> 00:08:40,986
We'll only accept orders
for stitching new clothes.

65
00:08:41,819 --> 00:08:43,236
Brand new clothes only.

66
00:08:43,569 --> 00:08:44,153
Only?

67
00:08:44,944 --> 00:08:46,861
And what will you do for
the rest of the year, son?

68
00:08:47,236 --> 00:08:48,486
Ring the bell.

69
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:50,861
Daddy, explaining you is impossible.

70
00:08:50,944 --> 00:08:51,611
Listen...

71
00:08:52,278 --> 00:08:53,903
Listen... Listen... Listen...

72
00:08:54,653 --> 00:09:00,319
You should spend some time
learning how to run the shop.

73
00:09:00,861 --> 00:09:04,028
Otherwise,
if someday your dad passes away...

74
00:09:04,444 --> 00:09:05,903
...you won't be able
to run the show alone.

75
00:09:05,986 --> 00:09:09,903
Even if Death comes himself
to collect your soul, you won't die.

76
00:09:10,444 --> 00:09:13,861
Even when your fingers will become frail,
you'll still be altering lady's dresses.

77
00:09:14,194 --> 00:09:16,944
Son, soon you'll be following
in my footsteps.

78
00:09:19,569 --> 00:09:22,694
Daddy, I wasn't born
to alter lady's dresses.

79
00:09:22,778 --> 00:09:24,569
Then what are you destined for, son?

80
00:09:25,361 --> 00:09:27,569
I don't know yet, dad.
But I will know pretty soon.

How are you, brother Vicky?

84
00:09:46,444 --> 00:09:48,028
Stitch a dress for me.

measurements.

93

No, not deep.

94
00:10:05,444 --> 00:10:06,153
Keep it medium.

95
00:10:06,236 --> 00:10:07,861
Deep's better, sister-in-law.
It's in fashion these days.

96
00:10:07,944 --> 00:10:09,153
You'll look nice.

97
00:10:09,236 --> 00:10:12,944
I am telling you, my son
is the tailor-incarnation of God.

98
00:10:13,028 --> 00:10:13,861
Do you want it tighter?

99
00:10:14,069 --> 00:10:15,361
The shoulder on this dress...

100
00:10:15,444 --> 00:10:18,694

I've stitched thousands of clothes.

104
00:10:38,611 --> 00:10:40,528
But the way his fingers
moves on the machine...

105
00:10:40,611 --> 00:10:43,236
...feels like God's fingers
moving on the machine.

106
00:10:43,903 --> 00:10:48,611
The way he handles the scissors sounds
like Goddess Saraswati's playing her Veena.

107
00:10:49,194 --> 00:10:54,069
When he puts a thread in the needle,
I can hear conches resonating in my ears.

108
00:10:54,944 --> 00:10:58,656
I am sure it's some
connection from his past life.

Saw?

She doesn't even look at you, and
you can already hear wedding bells.

she always looks at me.

- One with the long hair.
- Yeah...

00:15:37,178 --> 00:15:38,693
"Vicky, please!"

179
00:15:39,193 --> 00:15:40,484
Vicky, please!

180
00:15:41,943 --> 00:15:43,151
"Vicky, please!"

181
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:44,901
That's what I am saying,
Vicky, please.

182
00:15:44,984 --> 00:15:46,276
You have no emotions at all.

183
00:15:46,359 --> 00:15:46,943
Give me your hand.

184
00:15:49,193 --> 00:15:50,401
"Vicky, please!"

185
00:15:51,234 --> 00:15:52,318
Now that's emotion.

186
00:15:53,109 --> 00:15:54,359
But why you?

187
00:15:54,526 --> 00:15:55,443
She wants me to stitch a dress.

188
00:15:56,318 --> 00:15:57,151
Stitch a dress.

189
00:15:57,234 --> 00:15:58,943
I have a readymade dress shop.

190
00:15:59,234 --> 00:16:00,693
Who gets dresses stitched nowadays.

191
00:16:00,776 --> 00:16:03,526
You idiot, stitched dresses
have a different charisma.

192
00:16:04,234 --> 00:16:06,234
And love is never readymade.

193
00:16:06,609 --> 00:16:09,026
It's always tailor-made.

194
00:16:09,109 --> 00:16:10,443
Right.

195
00:16:11,151 --> 00:16:12,401
"Vicky, please!"

196
00:16:13,321 --> 00:16:14,651
Bro put it on my tab.

197
00:16:16,443 --> 00:16:18,234
Jealous.

198
00:16:18,984 --> 00:16:20,068
She held this hand.

199
00:16:20,484 --> 00:16:21,026
Smell it.

200
00:16:21,609 --> 00:16:22,818
Sunflower.

201
00:16:23,818 --> 00:16:25,818
I think you should start
planning your wedding.

202
00:16:26,401 --> 00:16:28,068
Even I can hear wedding bells, Jana.

203
00:16:28,234 --> 00:16:30,693
Hey, ...snap out of your dream world.

204
00:16:30,943 --> 00:16:32,734
Today is the first
day of the festival.

205
00:16:33,026 --> 00:16:36,234
Lokesh is throwing a
party at his uncle's home.

206
00:16:36,734 --> 00:16:39,026
So we're going to have
a ball for the next four nights.

207
00:16:39,193 --> 00:16:40,276
Nobody be late.

208
00:16:40,484 --> 00:16:42,318
Meaning party all night and,
in the morning...

209
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:43,026
Full tight.

210
00:16:43,318 --> 00:16:44,068
Right.

211
00:16:44,151 --> 00:16:45,151
But that's in the morning.

212
00:16:47,484 --> 00:16:51,359
<i>♪ Just tell me why
do you throw tantrums. ♪</i>

213
00:16:51,734 --> 00:16:55,651

223
00:17:53,276 --> 00:17:55,026
You guys go ahead,
I'll join you later.

224
00:17:55,109 --> 00:17:56,484
What are you planning to do out here?

225
00:17:56,984 --> 00:17:58,818
My heart's a little restless.

226
00:17:58,901 --> 00:17:59,943
I guess I'll just sit here and pray.

227
00:18:00,026 --> 00:18:01,943
What's wrong with you, Vicky? Why
are you feeling so religious today?

228
00:18:02,026 --> 00:18:03,151
That dancer from Bhopal
must have arrived too.

229
00:18:03,234 --> 00:18:04,068
I've been waiting
for a year to see her.

230
00:18:04,151 --> 00:18:06,193
- Let's go...
- Jana, you just go.

231
00:18:06,276 --> 00:18:07,901
- I'll come later...
- Hold on.

232
00:18:08,609 --> 00:18:10,318
He's going to see that girl.

233
00:18:10,401 --> 00:18:11,401
One who said ♪</i>Vicky Please".

234
00:18:11,484 --> 00:18:12,943
And he's making excuses to us.

235
00:18:13,151 --> 00:18:14,693
Is sister-in-law coming?

236
00:18:14,776 --> 00:18:15,693
Then we'll wait too.

237
00:18:15,776 --> 00:18:17,526
- What?
- No one's coming.

238
00:18:17,609 --> 00:18:19,359
- I'll get the offerings for you.
- What offerings.

239
00:18:19,443 --> 00:18:20,984
Stop making excuses, Vicky.

240
00:18:21,401 --> 00:18:22,873
Remember, females have been
the reason for the downfall of men.

241
00:18:22,953 --> 00:18:23,568
What?

242
00:18:23,648 --> 00:18:25,818
It was a female who disrupted
Vishwamitra's penance.

243
00:18:25,901 --> 00:18:27,318
And I am not Vishwamitra.

244
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:28,484
And I am not looking for a boon.

245
00:18:29,401 --> 00:18:31,859
I am not standing on one leg and waiting
for some Meneka to disrupt my penance.

246
00:18:32,026 --> 00:18:32,609
What do you think?

247
00:18:32,693 --> 00:18:33,526
You explain to him.

248
00:18:33,651 --> 00:18:34,401
He's talking nonsense.

249
00:18:34,776 --> 00:18:35,526
Take him with you, Jana.

250
00:18:35,609 --> 00:18:36,734
This is not about any girl.

251
00:18:37,151 --> 00:18:37,901
Let's go, Bittu.

252
00:18:38,901 --> 00:18:39,526
Go on.

253
00:18:39,609 --> 00:18:40,234
Come soon.

254
00:18:40,318 --> 00:18:41,276
You too.
- Come on.

255
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:41,734
I'm coming.

256
00:18:41,818 --> 00:18:42,359
Not you too.

257
00:18:42,776 --> 00:18:43,359
Jana.

258
00:18:43,812 --> 00:18:44,443
Go on.

259
00:18:44,526 --> 00:18:45,484
Why did you say yes?

260
00:19:27,276 --> 00:19:27,901
Hi.

261
00:19:28,484 --> 00:19:29,359
Hi.

262
00:19:30,609 --> 00:19:31,068
Hello.

263
00:19:31,151 --> 00:19:32,359
I thought you didn't understand.

264
00:19:32,568 --> 00:19:37,234
No, I understood,
but it takes me a little time to...

265
00:19:37,984 --> 00:19:39,901
I mean I've very
little experience in...

266
00:19:39,984 --> 00:19:41,484
I...I...

267
00:19:41,984 --> 00:19:45,609
- Do you have a problem in speaking?
- No. Why?

268
00:19:45,693 --> 00:19:47,359
Because if you do, it can be treated.

269
00:19:47,443 --> 00:19:50,068
No, no, I can speak pretty well.

270
00:19:54,859 --> 00:19:55,484
Peacock.

271
00:19:55,734 --> 00:19:56,776
Peacock is our National bird.

272
00:19:56,859 --> 00:19:58,026
Peacock has a long and sharp beak.

273
00:19:58,109 --> 00:19:59,234
The Peacock is around 1.5 feet tall.

274
00:19:59,318 --> 00:20:00,109
The Peacock is a beautiful bird.

275
00:20:00,193 --> 00:20:01,734
The Peacock's feather has many colors.

276
00:20:01,901 --> 00:20:03,693
Some people believe when the female
peacock drinks the male peacock's tear...

277
00:20:03,776 --> 00:20:04,821
...then a baby peacock is born.

278
00:20:04,901 --> 00:20:06,068
When the Peacock dances
during the monsoons...

279
00:20:06,151 --> 00:20:07,359
...people are enchanted
to see the sight.

280
00:20:07,443 --> 00:20:08,693
Just like I was
enchanted when I saw you...

281
00:20:12,609 --> 00:20:13,359
Sorry.

282
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:18,276
By the way,
you're looking really nice tonight.

283
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:20,901
Even you're looking...alright.

284
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:23,068
Thank you.

285
00:20:24,693 --> 00:20:27,863
- You're late. The veneration is over.
- Is it?

286
00:20:27,943 --> 00:20:28,859
Yes.

287
00:20:29,026 --> 00:20:30,234
I didn't realize I was late.

288
00:20:30,693 --> 00:20:32,943
It's the ambiance.

289
00:20:35,026 --> 00:20:37,109
But I will inform you before
the veneration starts tomorrow.

290
00:20:37,401 --> 00:20:38,026
I will call you.

291
00:20:38,267 --> 00:20:39,818
Store your number on this.

292
00:20:40,234 --> 00:20:41,359
I don't carry a mobile.

293
00:20:41,734 --> 00:20:42,443
You don't.

294
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:44,026
Okay.

295
00:20:46,484 --> 00:20:50,443
So if I...or anyone else wants
to talk to you, or call you...

296
00:20:50,526 --> 00:20:51,401
...then how to do that?

297
00:20:51,943 --> 00:20:53,276
I don't know about others, but...

298
00:20:54,651 --> 00:20:56,859
...if you want to talk, then...

299
00:20:58,276 --> 00:20:58,943
Then?

300
00:21:00,109 --> 00:21:03,568
Just think about me.
And I'll come over.

301
00:21:05,193 --> 00:21:06,651
Fine, I will do that.

302
00:21:10,359 --> 00:21:10,984
Letter.

303
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:13,026
 <i>♪ To Vicky. ♪</i>

304
00:21:13,276 --> 00:21:14,026

305
00:21:14,984 --> 00:21:15,526
No.

306
00:21:15,984 --> 00:21:17,484
Read it tomorrow morning,
after you've freshened up.

307
00:21:18,818 --> 00:21:19,651
After...

308
00:21:21,859 --> 00:21:22,568
Okay.

309
00:21:23,109 --> 00:21:23,818
Thank you.

310
00:21:28,484 --> 00:21:30,443
By the way, it's quite late, isn't it?

311
00:21:31,318 --> 00:21:32,693
It's dark everywhere.

312
00:21:33,401 --> 00:21:35,234
I wait for this darkness.

313
00:21:39,609 --> 00:21:40,693
Okay...

<font color="#FF0000">FIRST NIGHT</font>

315
00:21:49,193 --> 00:21:51,901
What's the point of owning
a bike if you can't afford fuel?

316
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:53,901
Do you have a problem with petrol?

317
00:21:54,109 --> 00:21:55,943
It's always getting over.

318
00:21:56,026 --> 00:21:56,901
Forget the petrol.

319
00:21:56,984 --> 00:21:58,068
Think about Vicky.

320
00:21:58,318 --> 00:21:59,901
Stop fighting, Bittu.

321
00:22:00,651 --> 00:22:02,609
It was his good luck,
that he found a girl.

322
00:22:02,734 --> 00:22:03,943
But he could've introduced us as well.

323
00:22:04,026 --> 00:22:04,776
Why isn't he introducing us to her?

324
00:22:05,068 --> 00:22:06,234
I think there is no
girl in the first place.

325
00:22:06,318 --> 00:22:07,693
And if there is one,
then there's something wrong with her.

326
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:08,984
What was that sound?

327
00:22:09,276 --> 00:22:11,151
What sound?
I've been speaking all this time?

328
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:12,484
What sound did you hear?

329
00:22:13,609 --> 00:22:14,401
There, I heard it again.

330
00:22:14,901 --> 00:22:15,609
What?

331
00:22:16,901 --> 00:22:18,776
- Brother Rudra.
- Hello.

332
00:22:18,859 --> 00:22:19,693
Hello, brother Rudra.

333
00:22:19,901 --> 00:22:21,943
- Are you two in your right mind?
- Yes, we are.

334
00:22:22,151 --> 00:22:24,276
- Where are you two going at this hour?
- Why?

335
00:22:24,484 --> 00:22:25,193
What happened?

336
00:22:25,484 --> 00:22:26,693
The festival has begun.

337
00:22:27,318 --> 00:22:29,484
She will be out
hunting for the next four days.

338
00:22:29,776 --> 00:22:30,484
Who?

339
00:22:32,526 --> 00:22:33,151
She.

340
00:22:36,026 --> 00:22:37,068
Stree.

341
00:22:37,859 --> 00:22:40,484
Stop scaring him, brother Rudra.

342
00:22:40,568 --> 00:22:42,484
I am not scaring him,
just warning you.

343
00:22:44,026 --> 00:22:47,818
Look, our city is the
only place in this world...

344
00:22:48,068 --> 00:22:52,818
...where no male steps out alone
during these days of the festival.

345
00:22:53,776 --> 00:22:57,568
She abducts male,
leaving only his clothes behind.

346
00:22:57,943 --> 00:22:58,734
Only his clothes.

347
00:23:00,026 --> 00:23:02,068
It's just that I like you two,
you two are like family...

348
00:23:02,151 --> 00:23:04,359
...that's why I was telling you,
otherwise...

349
00:23:04,443 --> 00:23:06,776
Brother Rudra, please tell us.

350
00:23:08,026 --> 00:23:08,984
Form a triangle. Form a triangle.

351
00:23:09,068 --> 00:23:09,609
Come here.

352
00:23:12,318 --> 00:23:13,026
What is that?

353
00:23:13,151 --> 00:23:13,943
Beer.

354
00:23:14,068 --> 00:23:15,401
All right. I have mine.

355
00:23:20,026 --> 00:23:20,734
Yes.

356
00:23:23,484 --> 00:23:27,193
There are certain rules
to escape the wrath of Stree.

357
00:23:28,568 --> 00:23:29,901
Rule no. 1.

358
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:36,276
Under no circumstances, and I mean
none... don't step out of the house alone.

359
00:23:37,526 --> 00:23:42,943
And only those men are safe, who have
written outside their home, O Stree...

360
00:23:43,109 --> 00:23:44,109
...Come tomorrow.

361
00:23:44,776 --> 00:23:46,026
Rule no. 2.

362
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:52,443
If in case you've to step out, then don't
try to be a lion, be a wolf instead.

363
00:23:52,526 --> 00:23:53,734
- Wolf?
- Why?

364
00:23:53,818 --> 00:23:57,109
- Travel in packs, not alone.
- I see.

365
00:23:57,318 --> 00:23:58,693
Rule no. 3.

366
00:23:59,484 --> 00:24:02,984
If you ever come across the Stree...

367
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:06,026
...then she will first
call out your name.

368
00:24:07,193 --> 00:24:08,776
Hello, Tom-Dick-Harry.

369
00:24:09,776 --> 00:24:10,901
What do you do?

370
00:24:11,818 --> 00:24:13,859
Take off your slippers,
hold it in your hand, and...

371
00:24:13,984 --> 00:24:15,068
- Run!
- No!

372
00:24:17,109 --> 00:24:18,443
No running.

373
00:24:19,693 --> 00:24:20,901
Keep walking.

374
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:22,151
Do what?

375
00:24:22,526 --> 00:24:23,901
Keep walking.

376
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:26,068
Then she will call out to you again.

377
00:24:26,484 --> 00:24:27,901
This time with more passion.

378
00:24:28,068 --> 00:24:29,568
And what do you do?

379
00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:30,776
Keep walking.

380
00:24:30,901 --> 00:24:32,276
Then she will call out to you again,
for the third time.

381
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:33,984
With an enchanting, alluring voice.

382
00:24:34,193 --> 00:24:35,359
Like an angel.

383
00:24:36,356 --> 00:24:42,901
<i>♪ Embrace me now... because this
night may not come again. ♪</i>

384
00:24:43,193 --> 00:24:45,109
That's the kind of
emotions you'll feel.

385
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:47,943
Your breathing will get faster,
your heart will start pounding.

386
00:24:48,026 --> 00:24:50,359
Bedroom. Bedroom. Bedroom
will be the only thing on your mind.

387
00:24:50,609 --> 00:24:51,943
And what do you do?

388
00:24:52,026 --> 00:24:53,818
- Keep walking.
- No.

389
00:24:56,109 --> 00:25:01,234
No man could ever resist the Stree
when she calls out for the third time.

390
00:25:02,276 --> 00:25:05,151
You will start losing
control over yourself.

391
00:25:05,776 --> 00:25:07,151
And as soon as you turn around...

392
00:25:09,484 --> 00:25:10,234
Gone!

393
00:25:13,318 --> 00:25:15,984
But brother Rudra,
there must be some way.

394
00:25:16,193 --> 00:25:16,943
Yes.

395
00:25:17,526 --> 00:25:19,234
Rule no. 4.

396
00:25:20,158 --> 00:25:23,818
And the most important thing to
remember if you want to escape the Stree.

397
00:25:24,276 --> 00:25:25,818
At any point...

398
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:29,193
Yes, Shama.

399
00:25:29,818 --> 00:25:30,651
What?

400
00:25:30,901 --> 00:25:32,609
You're coming into my life.

401
00:25:33,026 --> 00:25:34,318
I am coming right over.

402
00:25:34,801 --> 00:25:36,801
Brother Rudra.

403
00:25:36,885 --> 00:25:39,885
You didn't finish the 4th rule.

404
00:25:44,655 --> 00:25:49,571
Keep walking!
Keep walking! Keep walking!

405
00:25:49,821 --> 00:25:51,030
Don't make a noise.

406
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:57,738
Keep walking!
Keep walking! Keep walking!

407
00:26:01,071 --> 00:26:02,780
- Wait a minute.
- No!

408
00:26:02,863 --> 00:26:05,613
Keep walking!
Keep walking!

409
00:26:26,821 --> 00:26:27,571
Bittu.

410
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:30,946
Jana, look.

411
00:26:31,822 --> 00:26:32,238
What?

412
00:26:32,321 --> 00:26:32,988
Someone's out there.

413
00:26:48,738 --> 00:26:50,988
Bittu. Wait.

414
00:26:51,238 --> 00:26:52,196
Stop.

415
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:55,446
Bittu.

416
00:26:55,988 --> 00:26:57,405
Stop Bittu, for your mother's sake.

417
00:26:59,405 --> 00:27:01,655
- Why are you running?
- Because you're running.

418
00:27:02,905 --> 00:27:04,196
Come on.
- Come.

419
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:06,405
What was that?
- I haven't the slightest clue.

420
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:08,863
Don't tell Vicky anything.
or he'll make fun of us.

421
00:27:09,238 --> 00:27:10,863
Do you understand or not?

422
00:27:10,946 --> 00:27:12,196
Do you understand?

423
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:14,738

424
00:27:15,738 --> 00:27:16,571
What happened?

425
00:27:16,863 --> 00:27:17,780
- Huh!
- Nothing.

Let's ask one of the guys.

535
00:33:34,488 --> 00:33:38,113
Guys... is anyone carrying protection?

536
00:33:39,155 --> 00:33:40,530
Come on, quickly.

537
00:33:41,446 --> 00:33:42,030
Hurry up.

538
00:34:00,071 --> 00:34:02,780
Lights back. Lights back. Lights back.

539
00:34:02,863 --> 00:34:04,488
I got the stuff.

540
00:34:05,071 --> 00:34:06,738
Why have you turned off the lights?

541
00:34:06,863 --> 00:34:09,738
I like the lights on.
Because now I've protection.

542
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:12,904
This thing is older
than my grandfather.

543
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:14,863
Such a cheap quality.

544
00:34:16,155 --> 00:34:16,946
Yes.

545
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:18,071
Narender.

546
00:34:26,863 --> 00:34:28,155
- What happened?
- There...

547
00:34:28,238 --> 00:34:28,988
What?

548
00:34:29,071 --> 00:34:30,030
Outside the window.

549
00:34:30,113 --> 00:34:30,780
What?

550
00:34:30,863 --> 00:34:32,905
Someone dragged him out of the window.

551
00:34:32,988 --> 00:34:33,658
Narender.

552
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:37,821
I came into the room and
someone dragged him outside.

553
00:34:37,905 --> 00:34:38,571
Stay here.

554
00:34:38,655 --> 00:34:39,363
You go check.

555
00:34:39,696 --> 00:34:40,696
Narender.

556
00:34:40,946 --> 00:34:42,446
Narender.

557
00:34:45,988 --> 00:34:46,738
Clothes.

558
00:34:47,363 --> 00:34:48,196
Clothes?

559
00:34:49,071 --> 00:34:50,280
Narender's clothes.

560
00:34:51,863 --> 00:34:53,405
Narender's clothes.

561
00:34:53,488 --> 00:34:54,446
Only his clothes.

562
00:34:54,863 --> 00:34:55,821
Stree took him.

563
00:34:57,446 --> 00:34:58,738
This is Stree's doing.

564
00:34:59,488 --> 00:35:02,571
Whenever she takes any man with her,
she leaves his clothes behind.

565
00:35:09,071 --> 00:35:12,321
But I don't understand one thing?
How did Stree come inside?

566
00:35:12,405 --> 00:35:13,155
I don't know.

567
00:35:13,488 --> 00:35:15,655
I wrote ♪</i>O Stree come tomorrow"
on the wall...

568
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:16,988
...so that we can party peacefully.

569
00:35:19,113 --> 00:35:20,321
Someone erased it.

570
00:35:20,773 --> 00:35:24,821
I think that someone
intentionally erased it.

571
00:35:25,008 --> 00:35:26,530
Who peed on the wall?

572
00:35:27,076 --> 00:35:27,821
Who was it?

573
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,071
Who was it?

574
00:35:29,738 --> 00:35:30,780
Speak up now.

575
00:35:32,988 --> 00:35:35,613
- Vicky?
- You did it.

576
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:36,946
No, it wasn't me.

577
00:35:37,363 --> 00:35:39,571
Oh really? Then who did this?

578
00:35:39,738 --> 00:35:43,196
Right... you went out
in the middle of the dance.

579
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,780
You peed on the wall.

580
00:35:44,905 --> 00:35:46,196
Yes, I did.

581
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,488
It didn't say no peeing here.

582
00:35:47,571 --> 00:35:48,071
Get lost.

583
00:35:48,155 --> 00:35:50,696
Why did you have to pee
there of all the places?

584
00:35:51,238 --> 00:35:54,071
My pee, my will,
I can pee anywhere I want.

585
00:35:54,155 --> 00:35:56,488
We lost a friend because of you.

586
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:57,363
He's a junkie.

587
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:58,738
He must be high and wandering around.

588
00:35:58,821 --> 00:36:00,613
We won't hear anything
against our friend.

589
00:36:00,696 --> 00:36:03,280
- You made him disappear.
- I didn't do anything.

590
00:36:03,363 --> 00:36:06,196
You made him disappear.
You peed on the wall.

591
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,863
Just a second.

592
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:15,113
Stop! Stop! Stop, guys! Stop!

593
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:16,863
What's the point of beating up Jana?

594
00:36:16,988 --> 00:36:19,446
Your friend's missing,
go look for him.

595
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,071
Stop ranting Stree.

596
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:34,988
It's pretty late.

597
00:36:35,571 --> 00:36:37,488
Daddy must be waiting for me.

598
00:36:37,903 --> 00:36:39,738
Even I didn't tell my
mom that I'm coming here.

599
00:36:41,488 --> 00:36:43,988
Fine, let's come back tomorrow.

600
00:37:00,446 --> 00:37:01,780
Letter.

601
00:37:04,488 --> 00:37:05,591
Here's the letter.

602
00:37:13,821 --> 00:37:16,071
Brother, some madam's here to see you.

603
00:37:16,196 --> 00:37:16,571
Who is it?

604
00:37:16,655 --> 00:37:17,321
Tell her to come back later.

605
00:37:17,405 --> 00:37:18,363
It's her.

606
00:37:19,405 --> 00:37:20,613
Take a look for yourself.

607
00:37:24,849 --> 00:37:25,640
What the...

608
00:37:26,765 --> 00:37:28,765
- Did you tell her that I am at home?
- I did, brother?

609
00:37:33,182 --> 00:37:34,182
Come here.

610
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:35,682
What are you doing here?

611
00:37:36,807 --> 00:37:38,724
- I want my money.
- What money?

612
00:37:39,015 --> 00:37:40,807
Money for the 'friendship'.

613
00:37:41,648 --> 00:37:43,349
Your friend didn't pay
me for the 'friendship'.

614
00:37:43,647 --> 00:37:44,182
So?

615
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,182
So you're going to pay me.

616
00:37:45,265 --> 00:37:46,307
Why will I pay?

617
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:50,599
I see... you pee on the
wall and I won't get my money.

618
00:37:50,754 --> 00:37:52,640
Has the government
put a ban on my pee?

619
00:37:53,099 --> 00:37:54,849
I can pee anywhere I want.

620
00:37:55,015 --> 00:37:55,849
Pay up quietly.

621
00:37:56,807 --> 00:37:59,182
I heard that the
friendship never happen.

622
00:37:59,707 --> 00:38:01,682
We were halfway through...

623
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:04,765
Please sister,
I don't have that kind of money.

624
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:05,724
I don't have money...

625
00:38:05,807 --> 00:38:07,724
Look here, stop making excuses...

626
00:38:07,807 --> 00:38:10,432
...otherwise, I will come down
here with my friends and make a scene.

627
00:38:10,515 --> 00:38:11,640
Calm down.

628
00:38:12,099 --> 00:38:14,224
And, your father won't like it.

629
00:38:14,307 --> 00:38:15,390
I have heard a lot about him.

630
00:38:15,474 --> 00:38:17,224
How much do I pay, sister?

631
00:38:18,057 --> 00:38:20,182
She's collecting donation.

632
00:38:22,656 --> 00:38:24,057
I think 3000 will be fine.

633
00:38:25,724 --> 00:38:26,640
Take some lessons from him.

634
00:38:26,724 --> 00:38:27,432
Jai Mata Di.

635
00:38:34,265 --> 00:38:37,932
So mister, are you going to stand
around like this or put something on.

636
00:38:42,932 --> 00:38:44,807
Take care of your son.

637
00:38:45,515 --> 00:38:46,682
He's bustling with energy.

638
00:38:51,724 --> 00:38:56,765
Son, I'm going to share a
really important experience of life.

639
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:02,057
Youth... is a weird phase.

640
00:39:03,765 --> 00:39:06,890
The body bustles with vitality.

641
00:39:06,974 --> 00:39:08,849
A tank full of energy.

642
00:39:09,807 --> 00:39:15,099
And this energy... craves to come out.

643
00:39:15,307 --> 00:39:19,307
But this body... is puzzled
about what to do or not to do.

644
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:21,932
And this restlessness...

645
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:27,474
...provokes it to have
friendship with the opposite sex.

646
00:39:27,724 --> 00:39:29,932
Dad, I hope you know
what friendship means here.

647
00:39:30,849 --> 00:39:31,682
Friendship.

648
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:36,390
Son, I was born in
this town before you.

649
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:38,890
I've had a lot of friendship
back in my days.

650
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:41,599
- You had friendships.
- I did.

651
00:39:42,307 --> 00:39:46,932
Yes, but once I met your mother...

652
00:39:47,515 --> 00:39:50,140
...she completely changed
my point of view.

653
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:52,557
The union of a male and a female...

654
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,390
- Listen to me.
- Go on.

655
00:39:54,474 --> 00:39:58,224
The union of a male
and a female is pure.

656
00:39:58,307 --> 00:39:59,599
It's auspicious.

657
00:39:59,765 --> 00:40:02,515
Like the union of Heaven and Earth.

658
00:40:02,595 --> 00:40:05,599
The confluence of Shiv and Shakti.

659
00:40:05,682 --> 00:40:08,349
But why are you telling me all this?

660
00:40:08,807 --> 00:40:12,057
I telling you so that
you don't pay for friendship.

661
00:40:12,224 --> 00:40:13,890
When did I pay for friendship?

662
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:19,182
- And what about her...
- Dad, she wasn't here for me.

663
00:40:19,349 --> 00:40:20,224
I didn't pay for friendship.

664
00:40:20,307 --> 00:40:22,599
Listen to me first.

665
00:40:23,724 --> 00:40:28,224
My advice to you is that you must
wait for a companion...

666
00:40:28,682 --> 00:40:33,265
...with whom you can enjoy this
process for the rest of your life.

667
00:40:33,349 --> 00:40:37,974
And learn to control this energy
bustling in your body till then.

668
00:40:38,724 --> 00:40:42,932
And if you can't, then...

669
00:40:44,057 --> 00:40:44,849
Then what?

670
00:40:45,515 --> 00:40:46,890
Then be self-reliant.

671
00:40:48,349 --> 00:40:49,182
Cater to your needs.

672
00:40:49,265 --> 00:40:50,474
Meaning...

673
00:40:50,932 --> 00:40:53,515
Meaning... yourself.

674
00:40:53,849 --> 00:40:54,807
How, daddy?

675
00:40:55,015 --> 00:40:55,890
I mean...

676
00:40:57,474 --> 00:40:57,974
I mean...

677
00:40:58,057 --> 00:40:58,807
Loss of words?

678
00:40:59,099 --> 00:40:59,932
Come on. Go out.

679
00:41:00,015 --> 00:41:01,682
Listen...

680
00:41:01,765 --> 00:41:03,307
Come on. Go out.

681
00:41:07,807 --> 00:41:08,890
Energy.

682
00:41:12,932 --> 00:41:14,515
Where is my energy?

683
00:41:21,015 --> 00:41:21,932
My dear Vicky.

684
00:41:23,265 --> 00:41:27,140
If she's started with 'my dear'
then she will end it with 'with love'.

685
00:41:27,224 --> 00:41:27,807
Okay.

686
00:41:28,015 --> 00:41:29,349
My dear Vicky, how are you?

687
00:41:29,932 --> 00:41:31,057
What a stupid question?

688
00:41:31,557 --> 00:41:33,224
She just met yesterday and
today she wants to know how you are.

689
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:33,974
Keep reading.

690
00:41:34,307 --> 00:41:39,515
Honestly speaking I was
really happy to meet you.

691
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:47,682
After talking to you I felt like that
we've known each other for a long time.

692
00:41:49,265 --> 00:41:51,724
Since I retreated...

693
00:41:51,974 --> 00:41:52,724
Returned.

694
00:41:53,724 --> 00:41:54,890
Sorry, since I returned
after meeting you...

695
00:41:55,182 --> 00:41:57,015
...I want to meet you again.

696
00:41:57,390 --> 00:42:00,432
And this time when we meet,
my dear Vicky...

697
00:42:00,765 --> 00:42:04,015
...can you bring these things for me?

698
00:42:04,182 --> 00:42:05,057
PTO.

699
00:42:07,015 --> 00:42:08,265
A quarter brandy.

700
00:42:08,599 --> 00:42:09,849
Half a kilo of mutton.

701
00:42:10,349 --> 00:42:12,182
A kilo of charred glass.

702
00:42:12,765 --> 00:42:13,682
Thornapple flower.

703
00:42:13,765 --> 00:42:15,599
Hair of a cat.

704
00:42:15,807 --> 00:42:17,099
- And...
- And?

705
00:42:18,015 --> 00:42:19,807
The tail of a lizard!

706
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,932
Thanking you, with love.

707
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:23,349
With love. See...

708
00:42:23,724 --> 00:42:25,599
What is this stupid stuff?

709
00:42:26,307 --> 00:42:28,390
Who asks to get stuff like these?

710
00:42:28,766 --> 00:42:29,727
Plus she drinks.

711
00:42:29,807 --> 00:42:30,807
So what if she drinks?

712
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:31,974
Sister-in-law is cool.

713
00:42:32,182 --> 00:42:33,307
That's not the point.

714
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:36,057
She wants you to get
the tail of a lizard.

715
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:39,182
And you're a tailor,
not the ancestor of lizards.

716
00:42:39,442 --> 00:42:42,307
You're prepared to go on this impossible
mission because she told you.

717
00:42:42,474 --> 00:42:44,390
Jana has been telling
to you to stitch a shirt for him.

718
00:42:44,474 --> 00:42:45,057
But did you?

719
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:46,557
I have been telling
you to let's go to Goa.

720
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:47,349
But did you?

721
00:42:47,765 --> 00:42:49,390
Trying to be a hero for the girl.

722
00:42:51,557 --> 00:42:52,724
You say something.

723
00:42:53,557 --> 00:42:54,474
What now?

724
00:42:54,849 --> 00:42:56,890
- She's asked so politely...
- So?

725
00:42:57,349 --> 00:42:58,265
Then I must get it.

726
00:42:59,140 --> 00:42:59,932
What?

727
00:43:00,057 --> 00:43:01,057
It's very simple.

728
00:43:01,849 --> 00:43:03,849
Guys always do what
girls tell them to.

729
00:43:03,974 --> 00:43:04,474
That's it.

730
00:43:36,459 --> 00:43:38,390
Shahjahan built the
Taj Mahal for his love.

731
00:43:40,057 --> 00:43:41,765
And our brother
chasing cats and lizards.

732
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:45,432
Whoever imagined love would
fall to such levels in 500 years.

733
00:43:47,474 --> 00:43:49,765
Tell me something, don't
you think something is wrong?

734
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:53,182
Right and wrong is just
a point of view, Bittu.

735
00:43:53,265 --> 00:43:54,890
Don't try to be wise.

736
00:43:56,432 --> 00:43:59,640
I am telling you,
I have a bad feeling about this.

737
00:44:00,807 --> 00:44:01,890
Something is wrong about this girl?

738
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,557
Got it. Got it. Got it.

739
00:44:04,807 --> 00:44:06,099
Got it.

740
00:44:21,373 --> 00:44:22,623
Come on, now hurry up.

741
00:44:22,873 --> 00:44:24,332
That Stree already
took one male last night.

742
00:44:25,083 --> 00:44:27,123
We must return home before
she comes out to hunt.

743
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:28,790
I am going as fast as I can.

744
00:44:28,957 --> 00:44:30,082
Don't be scared.
I am with you.

745
00:44:30,165 --> 00:44:32,582
You can't handle one woman, and
now you're scared of another.

746
00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:03,957
Hello.

747
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:05,623
Jana, meet me right now.

748
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:17,373
Vicky!

749
00:45:19,623 --> 00:45:20,248
Vicky!

750
00:45:20,915 --> 00:45:21,332
Hi.

751
00:45:22,415 --> 00:45:22,873
Hello.

752
00:45:23,431 --> 00:45:26,998
Sorry, I was too engrossed
in listening to music.

753
00:45:27,649 --> 00:45:28,565
What do you listen to?

754
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:29,940
English.

755
00:45:30,565 --> 00:45:31,357
Wow!

756
00:45:32,107 --> 00:45:33,607
- Akon.
- Who?

757
00:45:34,315 --> 00:45:34,857
Akon.

758
00:45:36,815 --> 00:45:39,107
<i>♪ Wanna be my Chammak Challo. ♪</i>

759
00:45:40,119 --> 00:45:42,190
The guy's like Kumar
Sanu of his country.

760
00:45:42,482 --> 00:45:43,065
I see.

761
00:45:43,149 --> 00:45:44,565
- You don't know?
- No.

762
00:45:45,283 --> 00:45:45,899
I see.

763
00:45:47,357 --> 00:45:49,315
You missed the veneration again.

764
00:45:49,399 --> 00:45:51,482
I guess I don't get
along with God too well.

765
00:45:52,149 --> 00:45:53,357
Right. Right.

766
00:45:55,232 --> 00:45:56,232
I...

767
00:45:56,649 --> 00:45:58,399
I brought this offering for you.

768
00:45:59,315 --> 00:46:00,440
I'm fasting today.

769
00:46:01,732 --> 00:46:02,899
Even offerings are not allowed.

770
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:05,357
I see.

771
00:46:06,232 --> 00:46:06,690
Doesn't matter.

772
00:46:06,774 --> 00:46:08,024
Whether you eat it or me,
it's the same.

773
00:46:09,857 --> 00:46:11,274
By the way, we can go inside.

774
00:46:11,649 --> 00:46:12,982
I know the priest.

775
00:46:13,399 --> 00:46:15,524
I can arrange for a
special veneration for you.

776
00:46:16,212 --> 00:46:18,232
And even make a donation
of 11 rupees in your name.

777
00:46:19,399 --> 00:46:21,065
- Your name...
- Did you get the items on the list?

778
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:23,024
Yes.

779
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:25,524
I got everything you asked for.

780
00:46:25,899 --> 00:46:29,024
You didn't tell me which brand
of brandy, so I got every brand.

781
00:46:29,289 --> 00:46:32,857
But it's better this way.
You can try every brand, for variety.

782
00:46:33,065 --> 00:46:35,399
And, I couldn't find a
cat with completely white hair.

783
00:46:35,482 --> 00:46:36,982
She had mixed colors.

784
00:46:37,065 --> 00:46:38,940
But what will you
do with all these things?

785
00:46:41,649 --> 00:46:42,940
Are you going to ask
everything right now?

786
00:46:46,774 --> 00:46:47,899
Let's go someplace else.

787
00:46:49,707 --> 00:46:52,024
- At this hour?
- Yes.

788
00:46:53,524 --> 00:46:54,357
Okay.

789
00:46:55,149 --> 00:46:56,524
But where?

790
00:46:57,690 --> 00:46:59,815
Let's go. I know a spot.

791
00:47:13,024 --> 00:47:15,149
<i>♪ Fair...you're so fair. ♪</i>

792
00:47:15,482 --> 00:47:18,065

797

798
00:47:31,479 --> 00:47:35,149

805
00:48:14,732 --> 00:48:16,440
- Vicky's gone tonight.
- Where?

806
00:48:17,190 --> 00:48:19,149
Focus on my meaning.

807
00:48:20,065 --> 00:48:21,565
I pondered over this a lot.

808
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:24,982
And the verdict I've
reached is pretty dangerous.

809
00:48:25,482 --> 00:48:26,607
What is your verdict?

810
00:48:26,962 --> 00:48:31,482
You were a genius at school,
then how are you so slow in real life?

811
00:48:32,024 --> 00:48:34,774
I go to the depth of every
matter and weigh it properly.

812
00:48:35,357 --> 00:48:36,815
My dear Pacific Ocean.

813
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,899
Why aren't your depths
showing you what I can see?

814
00:48:42,482 --> 00:48:43,399
This girl...

815
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:46,940
...comes once in
a year like an endangered species.

816
00:48:47,815 --> 00:48:49,107
And always during the festival.

817
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:51,482
And do you know who else
shows up during the festival?

818
00:48:51,690 --> 00:48:52,315
Who?

819
00:48:53,774 --> 00:48:54,440
Stree!

820
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:01,274
Mister, open your mind

821
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,815
Has anyone else seen
her except for Vicky?

822
00:49:05,524 --> 00:49:06,190
No.

823
00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:09,815
And what does she ask him
to get in her first love letter?

824
00:49:11,482 --> 00:49:14,524
- Cat hair, lizard leg...
- Tail.

825
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:16,065
It's one and the same.

826
00:49:16,149 --> 00:49:17,357
Who asks to get stuff like this?

827
00:49:19,732 --> 00:49:20,440
He's not picking up.

828
00:49:20,524 --> 00:49:22,982
- Mister, turn off your phone.
- You shut your mouth.

829
00:49:23,065 --> 00:49:24,482
And fill fuel worth 50 rupees.

830
00:49:24,732 --> 00:49:25,399
50 again.

831
00:49:25,815 --> 00:49:27,190
Why don't you ever put more?

832
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:28,982
Why don't you try
telling my father that?

833
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:31,857
You try calling him.

834
00:49:34,232 --> 00:49:36,107
He's gone to meet her,
I am telling you.

835
00:49:36,722 --> 00:49:38,732
Our friend is in trouble, understand.

836
00:49:39,503 --> 00:49:40,815
Stree has laid a trap.

837
00:49:40,982 --> 00:49:44,357
And our love hungry friend,
is heading straight for it.

838
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:46,315
He is actually cutting the calls.

839
00:49:47,315 --> 00:49:49,190
Why do people become blind in love?

840
00:49:49,344 --> 00:49:50,399
How would I know?

841
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:54,607
You can be anyone you want,
but not a devotee.

842
00:49:54,815 --> 00:49:57,690
Where do you think the new couple would
have gone to spend some time alone?

843
00:49:57,774 --> 00:49:58,440
The lake.

844
00:50:01,190 --> 00:50:07,357
<font color="#FF0000">SECOND NIGHT</font>

845
00:50:11,732 --> 00:50:13,357
How do you know about this place?

846
00:50:17,065 --> 00:50:19,065
And why did we come here?

847
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:23,107
Because it's dark out here.
And no one comes here.

848
00:50:27,732 --> 00:50:28,565
Dark.

849
00:50:32,607 --> 00:50:33,857
He isn't here either.

850
00:50:34,524 --> 00:50:35,399
Where could he be?

851
00:50:35,607 --> 00:50:38,024
I am telling you,
we'll only find his clothes today.

852
00:50:41,259 --> 00:50:42,524
Your clothes are very nice.

853
00:50:44,815 --> 00:50:45,857
Where did you buy them?

854
00:50:46,357 --> 00:50:47,815
I designed them myself.

855
00:50:48,399 --> 00:50:50,357
People call me the Manish
Malhotra of Chanderi.

856
00:50:53,107 --> 00:50:54,357
Isn't it too tight?

857
00:50:54,565 --> 00:50:55,899
It's just my body...

858
00:50:55,982 --> 00:50:57,190
How do you open it?

859
00:51:00,857 --> 00:51:02,065
- Listen.
- Yeah...

860
00:51:02,145 --> 00:51:04,065
- Shall we leave?
- Why?

861
00:51:04,482 --> 00:51:06,690
- Are you scared too?
- No.

862
00:51:07,065 --> 00:51:08,524
I am not scared of
any ghosts or spirits.

863
00:51:08,815 --> 00:51:11,607
But how long are we going
to waste our time on a selfish guy?

864
00:51:11,899 --> 00:51:13,399
But he's our friend.

865
00:51:17,524 --> 00:51:18,315
Bittu.

866
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:19,524
Wait.

867
00:51:20,315 --> 00:51:22,357
So what else do you
stitch at your shop?

868
00:51:22,815 --> 00:51:25,274
Just skirts and long dresses,
or anything else?

869
00:51:25,815 --> 00:51:27,149
Actually, we make everything.

870
00:51:27,399 --> 00:51:28,399
Completely ladies fashion.

871
00:51:28,732 --> 00:51:31,982
Skirts, tops, traditional dresses,
tunics. Midis, minis.

872
00:51:32,065 --> 00:51:36,899
Short dresses, long dresses,
kaftans, fringe, party dresses.

873
00:51:37,149 --> 00:51:43,982
Mirror work,
stonework, designer panty, nightfall.

874
00:51:44,899 --> 00:51:46,190
Nighty fall.

875
00:51:46,690 --> 00:51:47,399
That's it.

876
00:51:49,774 --> 00:51:51,440
When will you give me my dress?

877
00:51:52,065 --> 00:51:55,107
It completely slipped off my mind.

878
00:51:58,024 --> 00:52:01,607
- I troubled you a lot, didn't I?
- Of course not.

879
00:52:02,015 --> 00:52:03,274
It was no trouble at all.

880
00:52:03,524 --> 00:52:06,399
And anything for you.

881
00:52:11,065 --> 00:52:13,440
I should have taken
your measurements that day.

882
00:52:14,815 --> 00:52:16,524
I thought you did.

883
00:52:17,315 --> 00:52:22,190
Normally I am good at this,
but in your case, I goofed up.

884
00:52:29,565 --> 00:52:30,482
So take it now.

885
00:52:31,482 --> 00:52:33,815
But I don't have my measuring tape.

886
00:52:34,190 --> 00:52:35,857
Can't you take my
measurement without it?

887
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:38,774
I can, but...

888
00:52:39,607 --> 00:52:40,524
Should I?

889
00:52:41,190 --> 00:52:41,732
Take it.

890
00:52:42,482 --> 00:52:43,190
Should I?

891
00:52:43,815 --> 00:52:44,774
Take it.

892
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:47,315
Okay, I will.

893
00:54:28,149 --> 00:54:28,982
Hello.

894
00:54:30,149 --> 00:54:30,982
Where are you?

895
00:54:31,065 --> 00:54:31,940
Hello.

896
00:54:40,774 --> 00:54:41,899
- Bittu.
- Yes.

897
00:54:41,982 --> 00:54:43,940
I am missing my mom.

898
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:47,149
Shall we go back?

899
00:54:48,149 --> 00:54:49,649
You're right.

900
00:54:50,607 --> 00:54:55,274
- Parents are more important than friends.
- You're right.

901
00:54:55,815 --> 00:54:57,107
Let's go back.

902
00:55:03,065 --> 00:55:03,815
What happened?

903
00:55:06,315 --> 00:55:07,482
Let me check.

904
00:55:15,732 --> 00:55:16,277
What?

905
00:55:16,357 --> 00:55:17,857
I think we're out of petrol.

906
00:55:18,274 --> 00:55:20,399
I told you, didn't I?

907
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:23,232
Tell me one thing...is
your father a menial labor?

908
00:55:24,274 --> 00:55:25,315
You own a big shop in the city.

909
00:55:25,524 --> 00:55:27,857
From Manish Malhotra to Manish Behl.

910
00:55:27,982 --> 00:55:28,607
What is this?

911
00:55:29,357 --> 00:55:32,065
Whether you fill 50 rupees
petrol at a time or fill your tank.

912
00:55:32,357 --> 00:55:33,440
It's still the same.

913
00:55:33,524 --> 00:55:35,232
The petrol pump is close-by. Push.

914
00:55:35,690 --> 00:55:37,190
It's your bike, isn't it?

915
00:55:37,315 --> 00:55:37,899
You push.

916
00:55:38,149 --> 00:55:39,024
Why should I?

917
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:40,607
I've been pushing
it since we were kids.

918
00:55:40,857 --> 00:55:41,774
What's wrong with you?

919
00:55:41,982 --> 00:55:43,274
That Stree is wandering
around the city.

920
00:55:43,524 --> 00:55:45,940
And we're stuck in
the middle of nowhere.

921
00:55:46,107 --> 00:55:47,399
And you want to know what's wrong?

922
00:55:47,857 --> 00:55:48,940
Mom clearly said that
I should come back soon.

923
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:53,107
If I don't hurry up,
she will lock the doors and sleep.

924
00:55:53,482 --> 00:55:53,982
What now?

925
00:55:54,732 --> 00:55:55,732
Push!

926
00:56:02,190 --> 00:56:03,024
Mummy!

927
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:08,774
Hello.

928
00:56:13,399 --> 00:56:14,440
Where are you?

929
00:56:16,274 --> 00:56:17,440
Madam.

930
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:42,857
Where are you going?

931
00:56:44,024 --> 00:56:45,649
I knew it, selfish rascal.

932
00:56:45,732 --> 00:56:46,899
What's wrong with you today?

933
00:56:46,982 --> 00:56:48,690
I am your friend, not your slave.

934
00:56:48,857 --> 00:56:51,399
First I go over to your house so that you
can tuck yourself neatly under the blanket.

935
00:56:51,649 --> 00:56:54,107
- And then I go home all alone.
- But we do that all the time.

936
00:56:54,190 --> 00:56:54,774
Not today.

937
00:56:54,857 --> 00:56:55,357
Fine, let it be.

938
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:56,440
I've been listening to
your nonsense for a long time.

939
00:56:56,524 --> 00:56:56,899
Go on.

940
00:56:56,982 --> 00:56:57,774
Fine, you don't have to.

941
00:56:57,982 --> 00:56:58,732
Get going.

942
00:56:58,982 --> 00:56:59,899
Weird guy.

943
00:57:00,774 --> 00:57:03,315
- I hope Stree abducts you.
- Same to you.

944
00:58:40,232 --> 00:58:40,982
Son!

945
00:58:41,357 --> 00:58:42,940
No...no...

946
00:59:02,399 --> 00:59:06,857
If you ever come across the Stree,
this is what you do.

947
00:59:14,024 --> 00:59:15,982
Jana

948
00:59:18,274 --> 00:59:19,190
No.

949
00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:21,524
Don't turn around.

950
00:59:22,232 --> 00:59:23,607
Keep walking.

951
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:31,649
Jana

952
00:59:43,024 --> 00:59:45,690
Jana

953
01:00:43,565 --> 01:00:46,690
No... No... No!

954
01:00:56,815 --> 01:00:59,065
Jana

955
01:01:00,114 --> 01:01:03,065
Jana. My Jana.

956
01:01:04,357 --> 01:01:06,065
Curse that Stree.

957
01:01:06,419 --> 01:01:09,815
My Jana never even touched any female.

958
01:01:10,357 --> 01:01:12,649
And now she must be
sitting on top on him.

959
01:01:13,386 --> 01:01:17,982
I told him a thousand times not to hang
around with these worthless friends.

960
01:01:18,651 --> 01:01:21,190
Jana could've had a good job.

961
01:01:21,815 --> 01:01:25,149
But these rascal friends spoiled him.

962
01:01:25,899 --> 01:01:28,274
Lord, give him strength.

963
01:01:28,815 --> 01:01:31,024
Give my son strength.

964
01:01:31,274 --> 01:01:32,899
I know you went to meet her.

965
01:01:34,607 --> 01:01:37,815
Stop getting jealous of my love life.
Think about Jana.

966
01:01:38,690 --> 01:01:40,399
Did anything weird happen?

967
01:01:41,190 --> 01:01:42,065
Weird how?

968
01:01:42,482 --> 01:01:45,315
Anything at all,
when you were with her?

969
01:01:45,774 --> 01:01:47,607
What did you two do?

970
01:01:48,649 --> 01:01:49,482
Why?

971
01:01:49,774 --> 01:01:50,815
Just tell me.

972
01:01:53,690 --> 01:01:54,899
We went to the temple.

973
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:56,982
Then to the river banks.

974
01:01:57,607 --> 01:02:00,274
We were just sitting and chatting,
and then she disappeared.

975
01:02:00,815 --> 01:02:01,899
And didn't return.

976
01:02:02,107 --> 01:02:02,940
I knew it.

977
01:02:04,774 --> 01:02:06,024
I knew it, Vicky.

978
01:02:06,232 --> 01:02:06,774
What?

979
01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:09,899
- That your girlfriend is a ghost.
- What do you mean ghost?

980
01:02:10,190 --> 01:02:11,899
Jana and I were coming to save you.

981
01:02:11,982 --> 01:02:14,649
- And she took Jana instead.
- What nonsense.

982
01:02:15,065 --> 01:02:17,940
Snap out of your dream world, Romeo.

983
01:02:18,357 --> 01:02:22,649
Why does your girlfriend show up only
during the festival, and then disappear?

984
01:02:24,190 --> 01:02:26,732
She asks you to get ingredients
for black magic in her love letter.

985
01:02:27,524 --> 01:02:28,774
Have you ever seen her feet?

986
01:02:29,024 --> 01:02:30,065
Are they straight or crooked?

987
01:02:30,357 --> 01:02:31,232
Did you ask her name?

988
01:02:31,315 --> 01:02:32,482
Do you know her phone number?

989
01:02:34,357 --> 01:02:37,274
Has anyone seen her except for you?
Because I haven't.

990
01:02:40,024 --> 01:02:40,982
But...

991
01:02:46,274 --> 01:02:47,149
OH F***

992
01:02:52,399 --> 01:02:54,815
I just don't understand one thing.

993
01:02:55,607 --> 01:02:57,232
How does she enter the temple?

994
01:02:57,774 --> 01:02:59,774
Are these ghosts atheists?

995
01:03:00,190 --> 01:03:01,732
Aren't they scared?

996
01:03:02,482 --> 01:03:05,982
She never enters the temple,
always stays out.

997
01:03:06,607 --> 01:03:08,732
She doesn't take the offerings either.

998
01:03:16,315 --> 01:03:19,857
Vicky, for the first time
I am feeling sad for you.

999
01:03:20,899 --> 01:03:24,232
Because of all the things in the
world... you fell in love with a witch.

1000
01:03:28,274 --> 01:03:32,274
Go and ask her,
your Stree, where she took Jana.

1001
01:03:33,607 --> 01:03:34,940
I miss him.

1002
01:03:37,857 --> 01:03:39,149
One more thing.

1003
01:03:41,190 --> 01:03:43,524
Don't tell her that
Bittu told you all this.

1004
01:03:44,482 --> 01:03:46,190
Otherwise, she might abduct me too.

1005
01:04:19,825 --> 01:04:22,992
Warning! Warning! Warning!

1006
01:04:23,450 --> 01:04:27,367
An important piece of warning
for all the males in the city.

1007
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:32,534
Stree is out hunting
and the males are in threat.

1008
01:04:32,825 --> 01:04:36,284
The method to save yourself
from Stree is written in this paper.

1009
01:04:36,367 --> 01:04:37,992
Remember it.

1010
01:04:38,617 --> 01:04:40,409
- Show me.
- No, it's not for you.

1011
01:04:40,492 --> 01:04:41,159
You're safe.

1012
01:04:41,242 --> 01:04:45,325
If you ever run into Stree...

1013
01:04:45,492 --> 01:04:47,992
...then there's just
one way to escape

1014
01:04:48,159 --> 01:04:50,575
Under no circumstance will you...

1015
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:51,200
Hello!

1016
01:04:51,409 --> 01:04:51,992
Hello!

1017
01:04:53,409 --> 01:04:55,454
How do you know so
much about the Stree?

1018
01:04:55,534 --> 01:04:56,950
I know everything.

1019
01:04:57,242 --> 01:05:01,242
Tripple BA, Double MA,
literarian, musician, teacher.

1020
01:05:01,325 --> 01:05:02,784
I have all these degrees.

1021
01:05:03,367 --> 01:05:05,412
I spent my childhood
amongst crocodiles.

1022
01:05:05,492 --> 01:05:06,659
Rudra Book Depot.

1023
01:05:06,742 --> 01:05:09,242
But why do we write
"O Stree Come tomorrow"?

1024
01:05:09,409 --> 01:05:10,617
We can write something else.

1025
01:05:10,742 --> 01:05:11,617
Like,
"Stree, never come back again".

1026
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:14,534
As long as it's working,
let it continue.

1027
01:05:14,617 --> 01:05:16,659
And by the way,
if we ever have an unwanted guest...

1028
01:05:16,742 --> 01:05:19,450
...we don't directly say
"Get lost and don't come back<i>♪ to him.

1029
01:05:19,617 --> 01:05:22,159
We politely say
"Come back tomorrow".

1030
01:05:22,242 --> 01:05:26,034
I've heard that the Stree first
s**** her prey before killing him.

1031
01:05:26,617 --> 01:05:28,700
That's the system with
female scorpions too.

1032
01:05:28,867 --> 01:05:31,575
She swallows the male
scorpion which she mates with.

1033
01:05:31,742 --> 01:05:35,075
Listen wise guy, please don't
share your knowledge with us.

1034
01:05:35,159 --> 01:05:36,534
Leave all that aside.

1035
01:05:36,617 --> 01:05:38,909
Tell us what's the solution to it.

1036
01:05:39,075 --> 01:05:41,200
My wife says that I should
wear a saree when I step out.

1037
01:05:41,367 --> 01:05:43,659
Please don't spread such rumors.

1038
01:05:43,909 --> 01:05:46,284
Or soon we'll see everyone
in our city draped in a saree.

1039
01:05:46,534 --> 01:05:48,409
<i>♪ My beloved's arrived <i>♪ type.

1040
01:05:48,492 --> 01:05:49,075
No, no.

1041
01:05:49,159 --> 01:05:51,117
How does she know everyone's name?

1042
01:05:51,284 --> 01:05:53,284
Because all our databases
are linked to her.

1043
01:05:53,367 --> 01:05:54,075
I see.

1044
01:05:54,159 --> 01:05:55,492
Shut up, idiot.

1045
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:58,534
You see, two youngsters
have already been abducted.

1046
01:05:58,617 --> 01:05:59,909
Be alert.

1047
01:05:59,992 --> 01:06:03,034
Poor guy was abducted from the town
square. He was such a healthy boy

1048
01:06:03,867 --> 01:06:05,159
Wasn't he your friend too, Vicky?

1049
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:07,950
But not anymore. Not anymore.

1050
01:06:11,992 --> 01:06:13,742
- Keep the glass down.
- What?

1051
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:17,909
Trying to be over smart. Huh!

1052
01:06:18,117 --> 01:06:18,617
Get lost.

1053
01:06:20,492 --> 01:06:21,867
He's still alive.
My friend isn't dead.

1054
01:06:54,034 --> 01:06:54,825
Brother.

1055
01:07:01,784 --> 01:07:03,450
Sir. Sir.

1056
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:04,755
See for yourself.

1057
01:07:27,450 --> 01:07:29,700
Brother Vicky, you are amazing.

1058
01:07:30,075 --> 01:07:31,742
You stitched this dress in 31 minutes.

1059
01:07:32,034 --> 01:07:32,825
Sir.

1060
01:07:58,492 --> 01:08:00,700
- What happened?
- No... it's nothing.

1061
01:08:23,867 --> 01:08:26,034
No, I haven't done anything.
I didn't do anything.

1062
01:08:26,117 --> 01:08:29,659
Don't kill me, Stree. Don't kill me.

1063
01:08:29,742 --> 01:08:30,367
What happened?

1064
01:08:30,450 --> 01:08:31,784
Don't kill me, Stree. Don't kill me.

1065
01:08:31,867 --> 01:08:33,450
Vicky, what's wrong?

1066
01:08:36,159 --> 01:08:36,867
What happened?

1067
01:08:41,742 --> 01:08:43,742
It's nothing.

1068
01:08:44,325 --> 01:08:46,367
You look like you saw a ghost.

1069
01:08:46,450 --> 01:08:47,075
Ghost.

1070
01:08:47,159 --> 01:08:48,534
No... no ghost.

1071
01:08:48,617 --> 01:08:49,367
It's nothing.

1072
01:08:49,450 --> 01:08:52,117
- You okay right, Vicky?
- Yes, I am okay.

1073
01:08:52,409 --> 01:08:53,075
I am all right.

1074
01:08:55,950 --> 01:08:58,325
- Is it ready?
- Yes, it is.

1075
01:09:00,492 --> 01:09:01,242
Thank you.

1076
01:09:01,617 --> 01:09:02,200
It's all right.

1077
01:09:05,909 --> 01:09:07,117
Shall we go out somewhere?

1078
01:09:07,992 --> 01:09:08,659
Out?

1079
01:09:09,159 --> 01:09:11,117
I'll take you to another
one of my favorite spots.

1080
01:09:11,825 --> 01:09:12,492
No!

1081
01:09:12,659 --> 01:09:14,034
This is my favorite place.

1082
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:16,659
- Let's sit here.
- Okay.

1083
01:09:18,742 --> 01:09:28,075
<font color="#FFFF00">(HANUMAN CHALISA)</font>

1084
01:09:29,075 --> 01:09:30,825
There's magic in your fingers.

1085
01:09:33,534 --> 01:09:35,409
And even in my feet.

1086
01:09:35,742 --> 01:09:38,367
I can turn it around like this.

1087
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:40,659
Can you turn your feet around too?

1088
01:09:41,450 --> 01:09:45,242
- Is there a problem?
- No. What problem?

1089
01:09:45,492 --> 01:09:46,450
There is no problem.

1090
01:09:48,825 --> 01:09:53,450
Can I ask you a question
for my personal knowledge?

1091
01:09:54,075 --> 01:09:56,492
Do you believe in ghosts and spirits?

1092
01:09:57,700 --> 01:10:02,117
I've heard that a woman
wanders in this city at night.

1093
01:10:02,325 --> 01:10:03,492
Called Stree.

1094
01:10:04,284 --> 01:10:05,367
She is a witch.

1095
01:10:05,575 --> 01:10:07,575
She abducts males.

1096
01:10:08,575 --> 01:10:09,659
Strips them.

1097
01:10:11,409 --> 01:10:13,909
I know she must have a good reason.

1098
01:10:14,325 --> 01:10:16,617
No one is born as a witch. Right.

1099
01:10:17,367 --> 01:10:18,742
I understand.

1100
01:10:20,367 --> 01:10:23,659
My friend Jana,
he's disappeared as well.

1101
01:10:23,950 --> 01:10:25,117
He's a very nice guy.

1102
01:10:26,159 --> 01:10:27,950
People say that Stree took him.

1103
01:10:30,700 --> 01:10:32,450
Have you seen Jana?

1104
01:10:38,784 --> 01:10:40,034
Can I ask you a question?

1105
01:10:41,742 --> 01:10:44,909
Its personal,
but don't take it personally.

1106
01:10:46,325 --> 01:10:48,534
Are you...

1107
01:10:49,284 --> 01:10:50,034
Are you...

1108
01:10:50,242 --> 01:10:51,867
I mean not intentionally.

1109
01:10:52,034 --> 01:10:54,617
Are you... Stree.

1110
01:10:55,909 --> 01:10:57,200
I just asked.

1111
01:10:57,284 --> 01:10:58,450
I don't have a problem.

1112
01:10:58,575 --> 01:10:59,784
I was just confirming.

1113
01:11:00,242 --> 01:11:01,742
If you're a ghost...

1114
01:11:01,909 --> 01:11:03,867
I mean you are what you are.

1115
01:11:04,242 --> 01:11:06,242
If it's anything like that,
please tell me now.

1116
01:11:06,450 --> 01:11:10,367
I'll just be prepared mentally.
That's all.

1117
01:11:16,242 --> 01:11:17,200
Uncle.

1118
01:11:17,450 --> 01:11:19,575
Do you see that girl standing there?

1119
01:11:22,534 --> 01:11:23,325
What girl?

1120
01:11:23,492 --> 01:11:24,825
That one...

1121
01:11:25,325 --> 01:11:26,075
That...

1123
01:11:39,534 --> 01:11:41,284
You should listen
to your friends as well.

1124
01:11:44,575 --> 01:11:47,534
But how can a beautiful
woman like her be Stree?

1125
01:11:48,325 --> 01:11:49,325
Was she beautiful?

1126
01:11:51,450 --> 01:11:52,200
Sorry.

1127
01:11:54,534 --> 01:11:55,867
Think about Jana.

1128
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:57,325
What condition will he be in?

1129
01:11:58,450 --> 01:12:00,117
Lying somewhere naked in this cold.

1130
01:12:02,992 --> 01:12:03,867
What now?

1131
01:12:07,159 --> 01:12:10,575
We'll have to find someone who's
an expert in such absurd folklores.

1132
01:12:20,867 --> 01:12:22,075
You came to the right place.

1133
01:12:22,159 --> 01:12:23,284
I know everything.

1134
01:12:23,909 --> 01:12:26,742
- Doesn't get me high.
- Then why do you drink?

1135
01:12:27,492 --> 01:12:29,159
In Shama's memory, that's why.

1136
01:12:29,242 --> 01:12:30,784
Leave Shama aside.

1137
01:12:30,950 --> 01:12:32,742
And tell us what you know about Stree.

1138
01:12:32,867 --> 01:12:34,992
I am doing research on Madam Stree.

1139
01:12:35,617 --> 01:12:37,700
And like they say, the fruits
of hard work is always sweet.

1140
01:12:37,784 --> 01:12:38,284
Yeah...

1141
01:12:38,367 --> 01:12:40,034
- And I got one too.
- Sweet fruit.

1142
01:12:40,117 --> 01:12:41,575
No. Book.

1143
01:12:42,242 --> 01:12:42,617
Book.

1144
01:12:42,950 --> 01:12:44,492
Just a minute. Just a minute.

1145
01:12:47,617 --> 01:12:48,367
Here you go.

1146
01:12:53,992 --> 01:12:54,742
Ohh...

1147
01:12:55,075 --> 01:12:56,159
KS.

1148
01:12:57,325 --> 01:12:58,409
Ka Su...

1149
01:12:58,534 --> 01:12:59,742
- Are you researching on this?
- Not that.

1150
01:12:59,825 --> 01:13:00,950
This one. This is it.

1151
01:13:01,034 --> 01:13:02,700
This is Chanderi Puran.

1152
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:04,659
Chanderi has its own manuscript.

1153
01:13:04,742 --> 01:13:08,242
Our city is older than you think.

1154
01:13:08,700 --> 01:13:10,242
The spot where you're sitting.

1155
01:13:10,492 --> 01:13:12,492
If we dig beneath it,
you'll find the Harappa Civilization.

1156
01:13:12,909 --> 01:13:13,412
Right here.

1157
01:13:13,492 --> 01:13:14,200
Harappa.

1158
01:13:14,367 --> 01:13:16,117
You don't say.
Exactly under this spot.

1159
01:13:16,409 --> 01:13:20,825
So look, Chanderi Puran
written by Shankar Shashtri.

1160
01:13:21,950 --> 01:13:23,075
Here we go.

1161
01:13:24,867 --> 01:13:26,659
Many years ago.

1162
01:13:28,825 --> 01:13:32,742
Many years ago there used to be
a beautiful and attractive courtesan.

1163
01:13:33,159 --> 01:13:35,700
Every male in the city
would dream about her.

1164
01:13:36,367 --> 01:13:41,117
Finally, she found a man
who loved soul and not her body.

1165
01:13:41,450 --> 01:13:42,409
True love.

1166
01:13:42,617 --> 01:13:44,242
And talk about your generation.

1167
01:13:44,409 --> 01:13:45,867
Love at first sight.

1168
01:13:45,950 --> 01:13:47,325
Then your place or mine.

1169
01:13:47,492 --> 01:13:49,034
What direction is this
generation heading in?

1170
01:13:49,117 --> 01:13:50,034
Brother Rudra.

1171
01:13:50,534 --> 01:13:51,200
Don't try to be a dad.

1172
01:13:51,284 --> 01:13:53,034
- Please read ahead.
- Yes.

1173
01:13:53,659 --> 01:13:55,659
They both decided to get married.

1174
01:13:56,284 --> 01:13:58,450
But the other males
couldn't tolerate their joy.

1175
01:13:58,534 --> 01:14:04,325
And before their wedding night, some
jealous people murdered both of them.

1176
01:14:06,034 --> 01:14:07,659
Since then she has been
wandering in this city.

1177
01:14:08,117 --> 01:14:12,367
Looking for her love,
and complete her wedding night.

1178
01:14:12,575 --> 01:14:16,617
And this can only happen when
she will find her lost love again.

1179
01:14:17,075 --> 01:14:18,742
Such insolent people.

1180
01:14:18,950 --> 01:14:21,242
They can't tolerate
someone's happiness.

1181
01:14:21,409 --> 01:14:23,284
Every female has the
right to find her true love.

1182
01:14:23,367 --> 01:14:24,784
Brother Rudra. Brother Rudra.

1183
01:14:24,867 --> 01:14:27,117
We can have this debate later.

1184
01:14:27,367 --> 01:14:29,950
First, tell us if there's
a method to stop Stree?

1185
01:14:30,909 --> 01:14:32,950
There I just one way
to get rid of Stree...

1186
01:14:33,034 --> 01:14:34,409
- Yeah
- Turn the page.

1187
01:14:35,284 --> 01:14:36,617
- Turn the page.
- Okay.

1188
01:14:39,784 --> 01:14:42,575
The city's main business was silk.

1189
01:14:42,742 --> 01:14:44,454
People had such high
Scarcity for education,

1190
01:14:44,534 --> 01:14:46,659
...that they actually believed
that the moon was their uncle.

1191
01:14:46,742 --> 01:14:47,867
The main...

1192
01:14:48,367 --> 01:14:51,034
How come Shastri turn
up in west from east.

1193
01:14:52,325 --> 01:14:54,117
After page 66 there is page 80.

1194
01:14:54,242 --> 01:14:55,034
Where are the rest of the pages?

1195
01:14:55,159 --> 01:14:57,784
This is why I don't let anyone in.

1196
01:14:58,034 --> 01:15:00,700
Children tear pages from
the book and make paper boats.

1197
01:15:00,784 --> 01:15:02,409
How will we save Jana now?

1198
01:15:02,492 --> 01:15:03,284
Just a minute.

1199
01:15:04,784 --> 01:15:06,034
I've seen this place.

1200
01:15:06,617 --> 01:15:07,575
- You have?
- Yes.

1201
01:15:08,700 --> 01:15:09,367
Where?

1202
01:15:09,742 --> 01:15:10,742
Above the hill.

1203
01:15:11,492 --> 01:15:13,325
- We should go there.
- Then let's go.

1204
01:15:13,409 --> 01:15:14,825
- We might find something here.
- Yes.

1205
01:15:14,909 --> 01:15:17,450
- Go. Go on you two.
- What ♪</i>go<i>♪ ?

1206
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:19,825
- You must come along too.
- Me?

1207
01:15:19,992 --> 01:15:22,909
- Brother Rudra, you have done research.
- Of course.

1208
01:15:22,992 --> 01:15:23,325
I see...

1209
01:15:23,409 --> 01:15:24,117
Wait a minute then.

1210
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:25,659
Let me take a sip. Take this along.

1211
01:15:27,617 --> 01:15:29,075
Shama, I am going.

1212
01:15:33,284 --> 01:15:36,409
<font color="#FF0000">THIRD NIGHT</font>
We'll run out of petrol.

1213
01:15:36,492 --> 01:15:38,159
How much further, Vicky?

1214
01:15:38,325 --> 01:15:39,409
Just a little further.

1215
01:15:42,950 --> 01:15:44,200
Stop!

1216
01:15:44,284 --> 01:15:44,950
Stop.

1217
01:15:55,492 --> 01:15:55,950
What?

1218
01:15:56,867 --> 01:15:58,284
I am allergic... to dust.

1219
01:15:58,367 --> 01:15:58,909
Come on.

1220
01:16:03,825 --> 01:16:04,992
It's so dark around here.

1221
01:16:06,617 --> 01:16:10,367
- What if she abducts me?
- She is a female, not a male.

1222
01:16:10,909 --> 01:16:13,409
She doesn't use force
against your will, like men.

1223
01:16:13,909 --> 01:16:15,700
She will first ask
for your permission.

1224
01:16:16,909 --> 01:16:18,284
Hello Mr. Tom-Dick-or-Harry.

1225
01:16:18,659 --> 01:16:19,700
And if you turn around.

1226
01:16:20,117 --> 01:16:21,492
Then she will think it's a yes.

1227
01:16:21,617 --> 01:16:23,242
Yes, means yes.

1228
01:16:23,659 --> 01:16:24,617
Then she will take you away.

1229
01:16:25,117 --> 01:16:27,534
So under no circumstance
will you turn around.

1230
01:16:27,825 --> 01:16:29,159
- No turning around.
- No.

1231
01:16:29,242 --> 01:16:29,867
Let's go.

1232
01:16:39,450 --> 01:16:40,534
Jana.

1233
01:16:41,534 --> 01:16:42,450
Jana.

1234
01:16:48,075 --> 01:16:48,950
Jana.

1235
01:16:56,117 --> 01:16:56,992
Jana.

1236
01:17:02,950 --> 01:17:04,242
Jana.

1237
01:17:08,159 --> 01:17:09,950
What are you doing?

1238
01:17:17,534 --> 01:17:19,242
Brother Rudra. Give me the alcohol.

1239
01:17:20,075 --> 01:17:20,825
Alcohol.

1240
01:17:22,284 --> 01:17:22,909
Why?

1241
01:17:24,575 --> 01:17:26,367
This is no time or a drink.

1242
01:17:27,450 --> 01:17:27,909
No.

1243
01:17:28,117 --> 01:17:28,700
Power.

1244
01:17:29,450 --> 01:17:30,450
No power.

1245
01:17:32,367 --> 01:17:33,117
Okay, give me.

1246
01:17:37,867 --> 01:17:39,409
Save some for me.

1247
01:17:40,492 --> 01:17:42,117
You're worried about the alcohol.

1248
01:17:42,242 --> 01:17:43,409
You go that way.

1249
01:17:43,575 --> 01:17:45,409
Brother Rudra, you search upstairs.

1250
01:17:45,492 --> 01:17:46,367
- Why?
- And I will look here.

1251
01:17:46,450 --> 01:17:47,284
Let's stay together.

1252
01:17:47,367 --> 01:17:48,325
We don't have time for that.

1253
01:18:43,034 --> 01:18:46,534
Hail Goddess! Hail Goddess!

1254
01:18:53,367 --> 01:18:56,867
Hail Goddess! Hail Goddess!

1255
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:02,200
Mom always said to learn
the Hanuman Chalisa.

1256
01:19:03,367 --> 01:19:04,742
Now see.

1257
01:19:06,117 --> 01:19:07,325
Sorry, mom.

1258
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:20,242
Snake! Snake! Snake! Snake!

1259
01:19:20,325 --> 01:19:22,034
Run.

1260
01:19:22,284 --> 01:19:22,909
Snake!

1261
01:19:41,909 --> 01:19:42,534
Mummy!

1262
01:19:48,284 --> 01:19:50,034
Brother Rudra! Brother Rudra!

1263
01:19:50,117 --> 01:19:50,825
Where are you going?

1264
01:19:51,034 --> 01:19:52,075
I was just warming up.

1265
01:19:52,742 --> 01:19:54,659
- I saw her.
- You did.

1266
01:19:56,950 --> 01:19:57,867
Brother Rudra!

1267
01:20:10,867 --> 01:20:12,242
Jana.

1268
01:20:48,867 --> 01:20:51,034
Vicky...

1269
01:20:56,450 --> 01:20:59,992
Stree... it's me. Vicky.

1270
01:21:00,867 --> 01:21:02,659
Remember I stitched your dress.

1271
01:21:04,034 --> 01:21:09,617
I am here for Jana,
he's a... very nice guy.

1272
01:21:09,886 --> 01:21:11,909
In fact, he calls you sister-in-law.

1273
01:21:11,992 --> 01:21:14,659
Vicky...

1274
01:21:15,992 --> 01:21:20,742
I stitched your dress in 35 minutes,
Stree, and you want to abduct me.

1275
01:21:21,575 --> 01:21:23,284
You hurt me.

1276
01:21:23,659 --> 01:21:25,492
I won't turn around.

1277
01:21:26,367 --> 01:21:27,909
- Vicky...
- I can't hear you at all.

1278
01:21:27,992 --> 01:21:30,125
Hello. Hello. Hello.

1279
01:21:53,242 --> 01:21:54,450
Daddy.

1280
01:21:55,867 --> 01:21:56,742
Daddy.

1281
01:22:57,367 --> 01:22:58,617
Vicky!

1282
01:23:08,284 --> 01:23:08,992
Are you okay?

1283
01:23:09,075 --> 01:23:12,159
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I am fine.

1284
01:23:12,617 --> 01:23:14,200
Is she gone?

1285
01:23:15,534 --> 01:23:16,409
Don't know.

1286
01:23:17,242 --> 01:23:18,242
Don't know?

1287
01:23:21,825 --> 01:23:23,659
But at least one good thing happened.

1288
01:23:24,409 --> 01:23:25,742
You're not Stree.

1289
01:23:26,825 --> 01:23:28,200
You know, like in the morning...

1290
01:23:30,367 --> 01:23:31,075
Sorry.

1291
01:23:31,703 --> 01:23:32,911
Shall we go back?

1292
01:23:33,161 --> 01:23:34,661
- But Vicky is still inside.
- Bittu.

1293
01:23:35,078 --> 01:23:37,994
Where were you?

1294
01:23:38,328 --> 01:23:39,119
Did you see Jana?

1295
01:23:40,994 --> 01:23:41,453
No!

1296
01:23:41,536 --> 01:23:43,619
Run brother Rudra.
He's fallen prey as well.

1297
01:23:43,911 --> 01:23:45,244
That's not her.

1298
01:23:45,328 --> 01:23:46,828
- She is not Stree.
- You are lying.

1299
01:23:47,078 --> 01:23:48,119
That's the girl.

1300
01:23:48,244 --> 01:23:49,328
The letter... Remember.

1301
01:23:49,494 --> 01:23:50,411
The dress.

1302
01:23:51,661 --> 01:23:52,703
"Vicky Please!"

1303
01:23:53,328 --> 01:23:54,244
That's her.

1304
01:23:54,911 --> 01:23:57,331
I swear she risked
her own life to save mine.

1305
01:23:57,411 --> 01:23:58,536
You two would've...

1306
01:23:59,369 --> 01:24:00,328
Been amazed.

1307
01:24:00,661 --> 01:24:02,286
She flung her dagger at the witch.

1308
01:24:02,453 --> 01:24:04,786
If we had posted her video on Youtube,
it would've been an instant hit.

1309
01:24:05,411 --> 01:24:06,661
#daggergirl.

1310
01:24:06,828 --> 01:24:09,578
But what is she doing here?
How does she know we're here?

1311
01:24:10,036 --> 01:24:11,953
Your friend is not
the only one missing.

1312
01:24:12,661 --> 01:24:14,369
Many people go missing every year.

1313
01:24:14,786 --> 01:24:17,078
I've been coming here for the
past three years during the festival.

1314
01:24:17,744 --> 01:24:20,203
So that I can get rid of her for good.

1315
01:24:24,453 --> 01:24:26,703
I know he will never come back.

1316
01:24:28,244 --> 01:24:29,078
But still...

1317
01:24:30,869 --> 01:24:33,244
You can share your sorrow with me.

1318
01:24:33,911 --> 01:24:35,244
It will lighten your burden.

1319
01:24:37,328 --> 01:24:37,911
No!

1320
01:24:38,494 --> 01:24:39,619
Okay.

1321
01:24:40,328 --> 01:24:42,328
By the way,
where did you learn this art?

1322
01:24:42,869 --> 01:24:44,036
I had to wander around for it.

1323
01:24:44,619 --> 01:24:48,203
I went to ascetics, and tantric.

1324
01:24:48,744 --> 01:24:52,078
Tantra, magic, hypnosis,
and spells from the red book.

1325
01:24:52,161 --> 01:24:53,203
I learned everything.

1326
01:24:53,786 --> 01:24:56,203
I've had only one mission
for the past three years.

1327
01:24:56,619 --> 01:24:57,828
Defeating Stree.

1328
01:24:59,869 --> 01:25:03,161
I tried everything I knew.

1329
01:25:03,911 --> 01:25:05,119
But it wasn't enough.

1330
01:25:05,536 --> 01:25:07,286
I thought I was ready.

1331
01:25:07,994 --> 01:25:09,994
I thought that I would
defeat her this time.

1332
01:25:11,078 --> 01:25:15,869
You see, ma'am. I've done
extensive research on this subject.

1333
01:25:15,953 --> 01:25:16,994
Research.

1334
01:25:17,078 --> 01:25:22,078
I have books on magic spells, hypnosis,
and other art forms in my library.

1335
01:25:22,286 --> 01:25:23,953
You can come over
if you need any help.

1336
01:25:24,203 --> 01:25:26,078
Even we have a shop
for lady's fashion.

1337
01:25:26,161 --> 01:25:26,953
Best in town.

1338
01:25:27,203 --> 01:25:29,453
If you need anything at any time,
just let me know.

1339
01:25:29,828 --> 01:25:32,953
And anyway... it's always
better than stitched clothes.

1340
01:25:33,369 --> 01:25:34,703
I don't like readymade.

1341
01:25:38,286 --> 01:25:38,869
Shall we?

1342
01:25:40,411 --> 01:25:41,286
Vicky.

1343
01:25:42,453 --> 01:25:43,244
What happened?

1344
01:25:56,536 --> 01:25:59,453
Jana. My Jana is back.

1345
01:25:59,536 --> 01:26:01,286
My son is back.

1346
01:26:02,119 --> 01:26:05,036
My son, where were you?

1347
01:26:05,411 --> 01:26:08,536
- Where were you...
- You'll tear his <font color="#FFFF00">(THE)</font> clothes.

1348
01:26:08,619 --> 01:26:10,036
He's lost so much weight.

1349
01:26:10,578 --> 01:26:12,744
Forgive me, son. Forgive me.

1350
01:26:12,994 --> 01:26:14,994
You really are his friend.

1351
01:26:15,078 --> 01:26:16,869
- I said such bad things.
- It's all right.

1352
01:26:16,953 --> 01:26:17,619
It's okay, aunty.

1353
01:26:17,703 --> 01:26:20,828
Jana, it's your mom, your mom.

1354
01:26:20,911 --> 01:26:22,161
I want to go sleep.

1355
01:26:23,286 --> 01:26:24,369
He wants to sleep.

1356
01:26:24,828 --> 01:26:26,328
- Yes son, let's go.
- Come on.

1357
01:26:26,453 --> 01:26:28,411
Please send my coat back.

1358
01:26:28,494 --> 01:26:29,161
Okay, aunty.

1359
01:26:30,411 --> 01:26:31,119
Bye, Jana.

1360
01:27:07,411 --> 01:27:10,036
Aunty. Aunty.

1361
01:27:10,119 --> 01:27:12,411
She took my husband.

1362
01:27:12,619 --> 01:27:16,703
She took my son too.

1363
01:27:16,786 --> 01:27:19,744
She took him too.

1364
01:27:21,119 --> 01:27:23,536
She took my husband.

1365
01:27:23,619 --> 01:27:26,286
My husband too.

1366
01:27:46,286 --> 01:27:48,703
But... how did so
many people disappear?

1367
01:27:50,453 --> 01:27:52,203
Someone erased the ink.

1368
01:27:58,828 --> 01:28:01,078
Jana, look what Stree did.

1369
01:28:01,411 --> 01:28:03,619
She abducted a dozen men.

1370
01:28:03,828 --> 01:28:05,744
And she's also erased the ink.

1371
01:28:05,828 --> 01:28:06,536
Jana.

1372
01:28:08,119 --> 01:28:08,619
You...

1373
01:28:14,036 --> 01:28:14,786
Jana.

1374
01:28:19,494 --> 01:28:20,494
Jana...

1375
01:28:22,619 --> 01:28:24,453
Why are you sitting like that, Jana?

1376
01:28:27,536 --> 01:28:28,619
And your palms...

1377
01:28:30,703 --> 01:28:31,661
Jana.

1378
01:28:39,203 --> 01:28:41,953
I am your mother.
Listen to your mom, son.

1379
01:28:42,578 --> 01:28:43,286
Jana.

1380
01:28:44,244 --> 01:28:45,953
Jana, spare your friends at least.

1381
01:28:46,411 --> 01:28:49,536
Listen to me,
I am already 70% damaged.

1382
01:28:53,994 --> 01:28:54,619
Jana.

1383
01:28:54,703 --> 01:28:57,661
We're humans, not kites.

1384
01:28:59,161 --> 01:28:59,869
Jana.

1385
01:28:59,953 --> 01:29:03,203
Vicky, look at Jana's hand.
He erased the ink.

1386
01:29:03,411 --> 01:29:05,331
- Divert his attention?
- Me?

1387
01:29:05,411 --> 01:29:06,286
Go.

1388
01:29:06,828 --> 01:29:07,578
Jana.

1389
01:29:07,661 --> 01:29:08,953
Someone get a blanket.

1390
01:29:10,119 --> 01:29:11,161
Jana.

1391
01:29:11,869 --> 01:29:12,578
Jana.

1392
01:29:13,036 --> 01:29:13,744
Jana.

1393
01:29:13,869 --> 01:29:14,869
Jana, stop.

1394
01:29:14,953 --> 01:29:20,078
Jana. Jana. Jana. Jana. Jana.

1395
01:29:21,328 --> 01:29:22,953
It's Vicky.

1396
01:29:25,578 --> 01:29:27,536
Jana.

1397
01:29:27,619 --> 01:29:28,619
Quiet!

1398
01:29:29,036 --> 01:29:31,119
Or else I will slap you.

1399
01:29:31,328 --> 01:29:31,869
Quiet!

1400
01:29:35,828 --> 01:29:36,953
Jana.

1401
01:29:37,036 --> 01:29:38,369
What are you doing?

1402
01:29:39,244 --> 01:29:40,578
It's Vicky.

1403
01:29:43,036 --> 01:29:45,619
Bittu! Bittu!

1404
01:29:50,411 --> 01:29:51,286
Come on.

1405
01:29:56,703 --> 01:29:58,411
This is the only solution left.

1406
01:29:58,619 --> 01:30:01,328
Wear saree and bangles like women do.

1407
01:30:01,453 --> 01:30:02,869
Your solutions were
not effective at all.

1408
01:30:03,036 --> 01:30:05,494
That Stree took 20 men.

1409
01:30:06,703 --> 01:30:07,494
Yes, Vicky.

1410
01:30:07,828 --> 01:30:09,453
Yes, I know. I am coming.

1411
01:30:09,744 --> 01:30:10,661
I am coming.

1412
01:30:10,744 --> 01:30:13,078
We want our youngsters back.

1413
01:30:13,578 --> 01:30:16,578
Whoever brings the
missing men back,

1414
01:30:16,994 --> 01:30:23,286
...will be rewarded
10,000 for every male.

1415
01:30:24,411 --> 01:30:25,494
Understand?

1416
01:30:28,328 --> 01:30:29,911
This city wants freedom.

1417
01:30:29,994 --> 01:30:31,578
Freedom.

1418
01:30:31,703 --> 01:30:33,411
Everyone knows...

1419
01:30:33,494 --> 01:30:35,119
Stree is a thief.

1420
01:30:35,203 --> 01:30:37,286
Let's all unite.

1421
01:30:37,369 --> 01:30:38,994
And drive Stree away.

1422
01:30:39,078 --> 01:30:42,119
You give us men...

1423
01:30:42,286 --> 01:30:44,078
We'll give you freedom.

1424
01:30:45,411 --> 01:30:48,411
It's the smoke coming on my face.

1425
01:30:49,744 --> 01:30:52,744
- Bittu, untie me.
- Wait.

1426
01:30:52,828 --> 01:30:54,203
No one listens to him.

1427
01:30:54,619 --> 01:30:57,494
David has turned into Goliath today.

1428
01:30:57,869 --> 01:30:59,453
How can someone beat
up your own friend?

1429
01:30:59,911 --> 01:31:01,411
We cannot waste any more time.

1430
01:31:01,578 --> 01:31:03,411
Jana is completely under her control.

1431
01:31:03,661 --> 01:31:06,036
We must do something solid
before the festival ends.

1432
01:31:06,286 --> 01:31:09,953
You're experienced in this field,
suggest something.

1433
01:31:10,411 --> 01:31:14,453
If we can find out more about Stree,
then I can come up with something.

1434
01:31:15,619 --> 01:31:16,578
But from where?

1435
01:31:17,786 --> 01:31:20,536
- We found a book at his shop.
- Library.

1436
01:31:21,994 --> 01:31:24,078
We found a book in his library.

1437
01:31:24,494 --> 01:31:25,494
But the pages were missing.

1438
01:31:27,203 --> 01:31:30,453
What if we find the
guy who wrote that book...

1439
01:31:30,744 --> 01:31:32,953
...then he would know what
was written on those pages.

1440
01:31:33,661 --> 01:31:36,119
- Do you know that guy?
- I know everything.

1441
01:31:36,286 --> 01:31:37,828
Is he alive?

1442
01:31:38,828 --> 01:31:40,203
He lives in Emergency.

1443
01:31:40,828 --> 01:31:41,869
- What?
- ICU!

1444
01:31:43,036 --> 01:31:44,078
Emergency.

1445
01:32:08,494 --> 01:32:10,286
Which book are you talking about?

1446
01:32:12,578 --> 01:32:14,203
Respected Mr. Shastri.

1447
01:32:14,453 --> 01:32:18,744
You wrote the history
of our city in a book.

1448
01:32:18,828 --> 01:32:21,994
Chanderi Puran, remember?

1449
01:32:22,494 --> 01:32:25,328
The book was launched
in my Rudra Book Depot.

1450
01:32:26,911 --> 01:32:29,703
You used to sell
adult books back then.

1451
01:32:30,703 --> 01:32:33,953
Mr. Shashtri,
that Stree abducted our friend.

1452
01:32:34,161 --> 01:32:35,994
She abducted many more males too.

1453
01:32:36,078 --> 01:32:38,036
Can we get them back?

1454
01:32:38,578 --> 01:32:39,661
Stree.

1455
01:32:39,828 --> 01:32:41,578
Please, Mr. Shashtri.

1456
01:32:42,244 --> 01:32:43,369
We request.

1457
01:32:46,161 --> 01:32:48,036
Did the emergency end?

1458
01:32:48,578 --> 01:32:49,744
We've been banging
our heads against a wall.

1459
01:32:49,828 --> 01:32:51,286
This man doesn't remember anything.

1460
01:32:51,994 --> 01:32:55,578
Yes, Emergency is over.

1461
01:32:56,578 --> 01:32:58,161
No-no-no.

1462
01:32:58,619 --> 01:33:01,369
Mr. Shashtri,
we're talking about Stree.

1463
01:33:01,536 --> 01:33:02,244
Stree.
- Stree.

1464
01:33:02,328 --> 01:33:03,411
Like,
"Stree Come back tomorrow".

1465
01:33:03,494 --> 01:33:04,203
Stree.

1466
01:33:04,828 --> 01:33:06,453
What is a Stree <font color="#FFFF00">(FEMALE)</font>?

1467
01:33:08,869 --> 01:33:12,036
She has no s tature compared to males.

1468
01:33:12,328 --> 01:33:13,244
What?

1469
01:33:13,494 --> 01:33:15,828
She should always
stay within her limits.

1470
01:33:16,453 --> 01:33:18,619
Never step out of the home.

1471
01:33:19,953 --> 01:33:24,078
Her job is to keep her husband happy,
and bear children.

1472
01:33:24,369 --> 01:33:29,203
And if she crosses her limit,
then burn her alive at the cross.

1473
01:33:31,203 --> 01:33:32,286
He has no solution.

1474
01:33:32,369 --> 01:33:33,244
Such vile thoughts.

1475
01:33:33,328 --> 01:33:34,411
We just wasted our time with him.

1476
01:33:34,536 --> 01:33:35,911
What kind of a writer is he?

1477
01:33:36,369 --> 01:33:37,244
Is this what he writes?

1478
01:33:37,786 --> 01:33:38,744
What about Jana now?

1479
01:33:38,828 --> 01:33:39,911
He's too strong to control.

1480
01:33:39,994 --> 01:33:40,494
Let's think.

1481
01:33:40,578 --> 01:33:41,869
He's got such a filthy mind.

1482
01:33:42,953 --> 01:33:50,119
It's not me,
its this city that has a filthy mind.

1483
01:33:51,536 --> 01:33:54,661
They used that Stree
as long as they wanted.

1484
01:33:55,036 --> 01:33:56,244
And then got rid of her.

1485
01:33:57,494 --> 01:34:03,203
And that man who gave her respect,
they took him away as well.

1486
01:34:04,744 --> 01:34:05,786
They will all die.

1487
01:34:06,786 --> 01:34:07,828
Everyone.

1488
01:34:10,536 --> 01:34:15,619
As long as there's even one male
in this city, she won't stay quiet.

1489
01:34:17,619 --> 01:34:22,578
Just one...
one man can douse this fire.

1490
01:34:22,786 --> 01:34:25,203
- Who is he?
- How does he look?

1491
01:34:26,661 --> 01:34:30,453
Wheatish color, long nose.
And treats himself like a king.

1492
01:34:31,494 --> 01:34:33,744
Born in the arms of the oak tree.

1493
01:34:33,828 --> 01:34:35,619
The prince of his family.

1494
01:34:35,953 --> 01:34:37,828
Love reflects in his eyes.

1495
01:34:38,078 --> 01:34:39,578
A true artist.

1496
01:34:40,203 --> 01:34:42,786
He's the true protector of this city.

1497
01:34:44,494 --> 01:34:47,578
A prostitute's son who's a bachelor.

1498
01:34:47,661 --> 01:34:49,661
Courtesan's son who's a bachelor.

1499
01:34:49,744 --> 01:34:53,411
A courtesan's son who's a bachelor.

1500
01:34:55,411 --> 01:34:58,328
Wheatish color, long nose.
And treats himself like a king.

1501
01:34:58,744 --> 01:35:03,703
Born in the arms of the oak tree.
The prince of his family.

1502
01:35:05,119 --> 01:35:08,744
Vicky. Weren't you born
at your grandma's house?

1503
01:35:10,453 --> 01:35:12,994
And there was an oak
tree behind her house.

1504
01:35:13,786 --> 01:35:14,578
Yes.

1505
01:35:14,869 --> 01:35:15,411
So?

1506
01:35:16,078 --> 01:35:17,453
And you're the only son.

1507
01:35:18,369 --> 01:35:19,619
Prince.

1508
01:35:19,994 --> 01:35:20,786
Very good.

1509
01:35:21,161 --> 01:35:25,411
Wheatish color, long nose.
And treats himself like a king.

1510
01:35:25,619 --> 01:35:29,036
- He has wheatish color.
- And a long nose.

1511
01:35:29,703 --> 01:35:34,703
And, you always think
of yourself as a king.

1512
01:35:35,036 --> 01:35:37,119
Love reflects in his eyes.

1513
01:35:37,619 --> 01:35:38,911
And a true artist.

1514
01:35:39,369 --> 01:35:40,786
There's love in your eyes.

1515
01:35:41,286 --> 01:35:43,578
And Stree saw that,
which is why she didn't abduct him.

1516
01:35:43,786 --> 01:35:45,036
There's love in my eyes?

1517
01:35:45,203 --> 01:35:46,953
Stree can see it, not her.

1518
01:35:47,161 --> 01:35:48,786
And you're an artist as well.

1519
01:35:49,411 --> 01:35:51,119
Aren't you getting carried away now?

1520
01:35:51,369 --> 01:35:52,536
What artist?

1521
01:35:53,036 --> 01:35:58,328
Vicky is the best ladies tailor
in the neighboring three districts.

1522
01:35:58,494 --> 01:35:59,286
Exactly.

1523
01:35:59,411 --> 01:36:00,869
This is a good coincidence.

1524
01:36:01,244 --> 01:36:03,453
But we must find someone
who has all five qualities?

1525
01:36:03,536 --> 01:36:05,578
And what about the fifth quality?
courtesan's son?

1526
01:36:05,661 --> 01:36:06,869
How will find him?

1527
01:36:07,828 --> 01:36:09,786
Courtesan means that right?

1528
01:36:09,953 --> 01:36:10,411
That...

1529
01:36:21,953 --> 01:36:23,494
No one told him.

1530
01:36:23,911 --> 01:36:24,703
Nobody.

1531
01:36:25,119 --> 01:36:28,536
Everyone knows, but you don't know.

1532
01:36:29,203 --> 01:36:29,786
What?

1533
01:36:32,619 --> 01:36:33,536
- What?
- Look...

1534
01:36:36,328 --> 01:36:38,619
There's no need to feel bad.

1535
01:36:39,411 --> 01:36:44,453
Some mothers are school teachers,
some are government officers.

1536
01:36:44,828 --> 01:36:46,703
Some make pickles.

1537
01:36:47,828 --> 01:36:50,661
- Your mother was that...
- What?

1538
01:36:51,328 --> 01:36:51,953
That.

1539
01:36:53,786 --> 01:36:54,453
What?

1540
01:36:55,828 --> 01:36:56,578
Courtesan!

1541
01:36:59,453 --> 01:37:01,411
I will kill you right now.

1542
01:37:05,078 --> 01:37:07,453
I thought you never meant
it when you called me a bas***

1543
01:37:07,953 --> 01:37:08,744
You...

1544
01:37:09,244 --> 01:37:10,369
This is absurd.

1545
01:37:12,619 --> 01:37:14,036
And in front of her.

1546
01:37:17,036 --> 01:37:18,744
Vicky. it's true.

1547
01:37:20,619 --> 01:37:23,078
Jana, I will break your head.

1548
01:37:26,661 --> 01:37:27,203
Vicky.

1549
01:37:27,286 --> 01:37:28,119
Don't look at me.

1550
01:37:28,744 --> 01:37:30,536
I won't believe you.

1551
01:37:33,036 --> 01:37:34,453
My mother was not a courtesan.

1552
01:37:35,453 --> 01:37:36,536
- Listen!
- No.

1553
01:37:37,161 --> 01:37:38,494
Vicky!

1554
01:37:45,703 --> 01:37:47,328
We've found the protector of the city.

1555
01:37:49,869 --> 01:37:51,203
He will deal with Stree.

1556
01:37:51,953 --> 01:37:54,619
- You mean Stree.
- Yes. Stree.

1557
01:38:12,369 --> 01:38:13,078
One more.

1558
01:38:20,619 --> 01:38:23,911
Brother Vicky, mom's asking
when you will return her blouse.

1559
01:38:28,453 --> 01:38:29,203
Dad.

1560
01:38:33,244 --> 01:38:34,953
What were you lecturing
me about energy?

1561
01:38:38,494 --> 01:38:40,536
You've done a lot of
friendship when you were young.

1562
01:38:42,953 --> 01:38:44,411
Tell me something.

1563
01:38:45,619 --> 01:38:49,161
Did you do friendship with mom,
or marry her?

1564
01:38:56,494 --> 01:38:57,744
Blouse petticoat.

1565
01:39:04,411 --> 01:39:05,494
Who was she?

1566
01:39:06,953 --> 01:39:08,036
Why didn't you tell me?

1567
01:39:10,078 --> 01:39:12,286
You kept lying to me.

1568
01:39:23,994 --> 01:39:26,953
Daddy, I won't drink again.
Swear on mom.

1569
01:39:27,911 --> 01:39:28,953
Swear on my dad, okay.

1570
01:39:29,161 --> 01:39:29,786
Sorry.

1571
01:39:30,744 --> 01:39:31,786
Eat.

1572
01:39:36,494 --> 01:39:37,911
You could've told me this once.

1573
01:39:38,078 --> 01:39:38,786
That's all.

1574
01:39:42,244 --> 01:39:43,036
Eat.

1575
01:39:48,301 --> 01:39:49,478
I talked to daddy.

1576
01:39:49,734 --> 01:39:50,911
And I thought how does it matter.

1577
01:39:51,536 --> 01:39:52,661
She was my mother after all.

1578
01:39:53,994 --> 01:39:55,369
Maybe my father's someone else too.

1579
01:39:56,161 --> 01:39:57,578
But I know only one father.

1580
01:39:59,161 --> 01:40:02,078
The guy who stands at the
shop with the measuring tape.

1581
01:40:04,161 --> 01:40:08,328
And who thinks that my talent
is the greatest talent in the world.

1582
01:40:10,828 --> 01:40:11,994
But this city...

1583
01:40:12,828 --> 01:40:16,453
Everyone knew about me,
but they never made fun of me.

1584
01:40:18,036 --> 01:40:20,328
Otherwise, people like to gossip.

1585
01:40:22,036 --> 01:40:27,494
I always knew that I wasn't
meant for altering dresses.

1586
01:40:28,161 --> 01:40:31,786
But I didn't know that
I was born to save these people.

1587
01:40:32,759 --> 01:40:35,968
Lord chose a really
unique mission for me.

1588
01:40:38,270 --> 01:40:39,884
"Born in the arms of the oak tree."

1589
01:40:40,528 --> 01:40:41,801
"The sole prince..."

1590
01:40:45,578 --> 01:40:46,718
"The son of a courtesan
who's a bachelor."

1591
01:40:47,884 --> 01:40:49,968
If I really am the
son of a coutesan...

1592
01:40:50,176 --> 01:40:52,051
...then I will save this city.

1593
01:40:52,551 --> 01:40:54,593
Along with Jana,
I will save everyone!

1594
01:40:56,291 --> 01:40:58,218
Bittu gather everyone.

1595
01:41:03,259 --> 01:41:04,676
What do we know about the Stree?

1596
01:41:05,218 --> 01:41:07,426
- She is scary.
- Ferocious.

1597
01:41:07,676 --> 01:41:10,218
No! She can read.

1598
01:41:10,468 --> 01:41:13,509
Have you ever heard about
a ghost or spirit who can read?

1599
01:41:13,676 --> 01:41:15,093
Right.

1600
01:41:15,176 --> 01:41:17,759
Meaning we're up against
an educated witch.

1601
01:41:17,843 --> 01:41:19,384
She is the new generation witch.

1602
01:41:19,618 --> 01:41:20,509
Point no. 2.

1603
01:41:21,009 --> 01:41:22,968
She comes every year during
the festival, to abduct men.

1604
01:41:23,426 --> 01:41:26,509
But if you write outside your
house ♪</i>O Stree, come back tomorrow".

1605
01:41:26,843 --> 01:41:29,259
Then she reads it and thinks...

1606
01:41:29,676 --> 01:41:34,843
"Oh... okay. Rest today,
and I'll come back tomorrow."

1607
01:41:35,301 --> 01:41:37,801
Meaning she listens.

1608
01:41:37,884 --> 01:41:39,301
Meaning she is obedient.

1609
01:41:39,509 --> 01:41:40,426
No. 3.

1610
01:41:41,009 --> 01:41:42,218
She is very stupid.

1611
01:41:42,426 --> 01:41:43,509
Next night she comes back again.

1612
01:41:43,801 --> 01:41:46,634
Reads the same line
again and thinks...

1613
01:41:47,134 --> 01:41:50,176
"Oh shit, now I'll have
to come back tomorrow again."

1614
01:41:50,259 --> 01:41:51,093
"This is cheating."

1615
01:41:51,426 --> 01:41:53,343
And she goes back to her home.

1616
01:41:53,509 --> 01:41:55,843
Poor thing doesn't understand
that these people are s...

1617
01:41:57,718 --> 01:41:58,676
I mean making a fool of her.

1618
01:41:59,134 --> 01:42:01,259
- She has a low IQ level.
- Exactly.

1619
01:42:01,384 --> 01:42:04,051
And we're much smarter than her.

1620
01:42:04,343 --> 01:42:05,009
Thank you.

1621
01:42:05,093 --> 01:42:06,593
And, if we get serious...

1622
01:42:07,426 --> 01:42:10,093
...then we can easily
get rid of this witch forever.

1623
01:42:10,468 --> 01:42:13,384
- Then let's get serious.
- Correct. Let's get serious.

1624
01:42:15,801 --> 01:42:16,884
But what are we going to do?

1625
01:42:20,843 --> 01:42:21,718
Wedding night.

1626
01:42:22,468 --> 01:42:23,468
Wedding night.

1627
01:42:23,884 --> 01:42:25,634
But brother Rudra,
aren't you too old for that?

1628
01:42:25,718 --> 01:42:26,676
No me.

1629
01:42:27,218 --> 01:42:27,718
No!

1630
01:42:27,843 --> 01:42:29,759
According to Mr. Shashtri's book,

1631
01:42:29,968 --> 01:42:33,301
Stree wants her wedding
night which was left incomplete.

1632
01:42:33,426 --> 01:42:34,301
Yes so.

1633
01:42:34,426 --> 01:42:36,009
And if you're the
protector of this city...

1634
01:42:36,093 --> 01:42:39,468
...then you must fulfill her wish.

1635
01:42:39,551 --> 01:42:40,468
What are you saying?

1636
01:42:40,551 --> 01:42:41,426
Have you lost your mind?

1637
01:42:41,509 --> 01:42:42,801
- No.
- What are you saying?

1638
01:42:43,426 --> 01:42:45,593
My father never even let
me watch a wedding night on TV,

1639
01:42:45,676 --> 01:42:46,884
...how can I do it with a witch?

1640
01:42:47,009 --> 01:42:47,718
Yes.

1641
01:42:48,426 --> 01:42:50,551
I am the protector, shouldn't
I prepare for a battle or something.

1642
01:42:50,634 --> 01:42:53,134
The battle begins
after the wedding night.

1643
01:42:54,093 --> 01:42:55,009
Brother Rudra...

1644
01:42:55,551 --> 01:42:59,259
You mean, me and that witch...

1645
01:42:59,468 --> 01:43:02,009
We just have to use it as bait.

1646
01:43:02,884 --> 01:43:05,634
We must lead her to you, that's all.

1647
01:43:06,051 --> 01:43:08,093
Remember she saw love in your eyes.

1648
01:43:08,426 --> 01:43:08,968
Yes.

1649
01:43:09,051 --> 01:43:10,968
- And then?
- Then leave it to me.

1650
01:43:11,349 --> 01:43:13,051
She is very strong in her own home.

1651
01:43:13,468 --> 01:43:16,801
But I know how to overpower
her when she is out of her house.

1652
01:43:18,259 --> 01:43:19,468
But where will we call her?

1653
01:43:21,465 --> 01:43:23,259
Right here, in Vicky's Palace.

1654
01:43:23,509 --> 01:43:24,176
Best place.

1655
01:43:55,509 --> 01:43:56,634
Show the bait.

1656
01:44:18,468 --> 01:44:20,676
Hurry up.

1657
01:44:42,301 --> 01:44:43,843
Stree is out hunting today.

1658
01:44:43,968 --> 01:44:46,593
Don't step out of the
house and lock the door.

1659
01:44:46,676 --> 01:44:47,093
Okay.

1660
01:44:47,176 --> 01:44:48,259
Come back soon.

1661
01:44:48,343 --> 01:44:50,009
I feel scared alone.
- I'll be back soon.

1662
01:44:50,093 --> 01:44:51,468
Keep the doors closed.

1663
01:45:05,843 --> 01:45:07,301
Vicky, you're looking really handsome.

1664
01:45:07,384 --> 01:45:08,801
- Now wear this cap.
- No, no.

1665
01:45:08,968 --> 01:45:10,176
- I said wear it.
- No, no, caps. You'll ruin my hair.

1666
01:45:10,259 --> 01:45:12,009
- But the groom has to wear...
- I don't want to...

1667
01:45:12,093 --> 01:45:12,718
Wear it.

1668
01:45:27,009 --> 01:45:28,759
Dad had such vivid
dreams about my wedding.

1669
01:45:29,426 --> 01:45:32,009
Who knew that I'll be
marrying a witch some day.

1670
01:45:32,176 --> 01:45:33,218
Don't worry.

1671
01:45:33,593 --> 01:45:35,426
You're getting a chance
to save the entire city.

1672
01:45:35,634 --> 01:45:36,801
Not everyone gets this opportunity.

1673
01:45:36,884 --> 01:45:37,346
Don't be scared.

1674
01:45:37,426 --> 01:45:39,176
Don't you want to save Jana?

1675
01:45:39,259 --> 01:45:40,843
Don't you want to make
him a human being again?

1676
01:45:41,384 --> 01:45:42,259
What is the plan?

1677
01:45:42,343 --> 01:45:43,134
What do we do?

1678
01:45:43,884 --> 01:45:47,384
Stree will definitely come here
after reading the message on the wall.

1679
01:45:49,634 --> 01:45:53,259
When she looks into your eyes,
don't look away.

1680
01:45:53,343 --> 01:45:55,051
Instead look into her eyes.

1681
01:45:55,634 --> 01:45:56,884
I know a spell.

1682
01:45:57,301 --> 01:45:59,426
That spell will render her powerless.

1683
01:45:59,593 --> 01:46:03,176
And then we must drive
this dagger through her heart.

1684
01:46:03,343 --> 01:46:05,218
Dagger? How can I...

1685
01:46:06,676 --> 01:46:07,718
We're waiting inside.

1686
01:46:08,009 --> 01:46:08,759
Don't be scared.

1687
01:46:10,301 --> 01:46:10,884
Let's go.

1688
01:46:11,134 --> 01:46:12,093
Listen...

1689
01:46:12,509 --> 01:46:14,551
Will your spell work?

1690
01:46:14,718 --> 01:46:15,468
90%

1691
01:46:15,551 --> 01:46:17,343
What is 90%?

1692
01:46:18,343 --> 01:46:19,676
Maybe 99%.

1693
01:46:20,218 --> 01:46:22,843
Meaning there is a
1% chance I'll be dead.

1694
01:46:24,468 --> 01:46:25,426
Daddy...

1695
01:46:25,759 --> 01:46:26,676
Let's go.

1696
01:46:27,051 --> 01:46:28,426
Listen.

1697
01:46:29,968 --> 01:46:31,551
I am going...

1698
01:46:34,426 --> 01:46:36,426
Don't worry, okay.

1699
01:46:36,676 --> 01:46:37,759
Don't forget you are Vicky.

1700
01:46:38,051 --> 01:46:40,676
The guy who can spend
a night with a witch.

1701
01:46:40,884 --> 01:46:44,093
In case I don't come back,
don't come looking for me.

1702
01:46:44,843 --> 01:46:47,384
And... look after my dad.

1703
01:46:51,968 --> 01:46:54,301
O Stree come back tomorrow.

1704
01:46:55,426 --> 01:46:58,426
O Stree there are no men here.

1705
01:47:00,218 --> 01:47:02,343
O Stree come back tomorrow.

1706
01:47:03,259 --> 01:47:06,259
O Stree there are no men here.

1707
01:47:41,009 --> 01:47:45,426
O STREE COME HERE.

1708
01:48:03,551 --> 01:48:05,468
O STREE COME HERE.

1709
01:48:16,426 --> 01:48:17,468
I think it's her.

1710
01:48:29,468 --> 01:48:34,051
O STREE COME HERE.

1711
01:48:43,051 --> 01:48:44,426
She isn't coming inside.

1712
01:48:44,593 --> 01:48:46,009
Is she suspicious?

1713
01:48:46,259 --> 01:48:49,384
Stree is smarter than
you all thought she is.

1714
01:48:52,384 --> 01:48:53,676
- Jana.
- Jana.

1715
01:48:54,009 --> 01:48:54,718
Jana.

1716
01:48:54,801 --> 01:48:55,718
Listen to me.

1717
01:48:55,801 --> 01:48:56,593
Jana.

1718
01:49:00,884 --> 01:49:01,551
Jana.

1719
01:49:01,801 --> 01:49:03,426
Leave him.

1720
01:49:08,301 --> 01:49:09,301
Jana.

1721
01:49:11,093 --> 01:49:13,593
Vicky.

1722
01:49:25,801 --> 01:49:26,968
Jana.

1723
01:49:32,468 --> 01:49:34,718
- Jana!
- Jana.

1724
01:49:46,551 --> 01:49:47,759
Vicky is missing.

1725
01:49:49,134 --> 01:49:49,843
Vicky.

1726
01:49:57,093 --> 01:49:58,093
Vicky.

1727
01:50:00,843 --> 01:50:01,551
Vicky.

1728
01:50:03,384 --> 01:50:04,134
Vicky isn't here.

1729
01:50:04,301 --> 01:50:05,051
He's not.

1730
01:50:06,176 --> 01:50:07,468
Where could he be?

1731
01:50:08,551 --> 01:50:11,259
Meaning Stree was here
and she took her lover.

1732
01:50:11,343 --> 01:50:12,301
Don't say that.

1733
01:50:12,384 --> 01:50:15,551
All our arrangements, the wedding
night preparations, didn't work.

1734
01:50:17,093 --> 01:50:20,384
Where did your sister take him?

1735
01:50:20,759 --> 01:50:23,676
- Vicky just sent a message, on WhatsApp.
- What?

1736
01:50:24,044 --> 01:50:25,468
He just shared his location.

1737
01:50:30,468 --> 01:50:31,551
Stree.

1738
01:50:35,009 --> 01:50:37,384
Where are you, Stree?

1739
01:50:53,343 --> 01:50:54,301
Stree, I...

1740
01:51:17,884 --> 01:51:21,051
Okay. Fine. I am sitting here.

1741
01:51:21,134 --> 01:51:22,426
I'm not going anywhere.

1742
01:51:23,384 --> 01:51:24,468
I am sitting right here.

1743
01:51:37,134 --> 01:51:38,176
This is the same place.

1744
01:51:38,259 --> 01:51:40,093
I guess she took him to the bedroom.

1745
01:51:40,468 --> 01:51:42,426
And she won't let him go until
she spends her wedding night with him.

1746
01:51:51,676 --> 01:51:52,634
Oh, God.

1747
01:51:59,593 --> 01:52:02,426
Stree... I am ready.

1748
01:52:04,051 --> 01:52:07,509
Come on this bed.
We'll spend our wedding night.

1749
01:52:11,843 --> 01:52:14,218
I am getting ready.
I am getting ready.

1750
01:52:19,593 --> 01:52:20,801
I'm taking it off.

1751
01:52:27,509 --> 01:52:29,096
Do I have to take my pants off too?

1752
01:52:29,843 --> 01:52:31,676
Fine, I'll take it off.

1753
01:52:36,343 --> 01:52:39,843
I am ready now. Come on.

1754
01:52:45,426 --> 01:52:46,593
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

1755
01:52:46,676 --> 01:52:50,384
Sorry, Stree. I understand
that you've no interest in all this.

1756
01:52:50,509 --> 01:52:52,301
I respect you.

1757
01:52:53,551 --> 01:52:55,426
I'll even wear my clothes back.

1758
01:52:55,593 --> 01:52:57,426
See, I am wearing them back.

1759
01:52:57,676 --> 01:52:58,676
Don't kill me, Stree.

1760
01:52:58,759 --> 01:53:01,384
I am the only son.

1761
01:53:48,269 --> 01:53:49,176
Vicky!

1762
01:53:54,426 --> 01:53:55,468
Jana.

1763
01:53:57,884 --> 01:53:59,259
What happened?

1764
01:53:59,339 --> 01:54:00,301
Is she dead?

1765
01:54:00,634 --> 01:54:02,551
She is just powerless at the moment.

1766
01:54:02,634 --> 01:54:05,551
But we must finish her
before she gets her powers back.

1767
01:54:06,676 --> 01:54:07,551
Where are your clothes?

1768
01:54:08,634 --> 01:54:09,551
Sorry, I...

1769
01:54:09,801 --> 01:54:12,968
I thought in order to save the city,
I will have to sleep with her.

1770
01:54:14,009 --> 01:54:16,509
But you know what,
I don't think she wants any of it.

1771
01:54:18,218 --> 01:54:19,093
Here you go.

1772
01:54:19,593 --> 01:54:21,551
You must pierce her
heart with this dagger.

1773
01:54:21,634 --> 01:54:22,801
And cut off her braid.

1774
01:54:22,986 --> 01:54:23,759
Braid?

1775
01:54:23,843 --> 01:54:25,718
How did her braid get in all this?

1776
01:54:25,884 --> 01:54:27,426
And, how will I do this?

1777
01:54:27,509 --> 01:54:28,426
You do it, please.

1778
01:54:28,509 --> 01:54:31,134
I would've done it if I could.

1779
01:54:31,218 --> 01:54:32,051
You will have to do it.

1780
01:54:32,134 --> 01:54:33,426
You're the protector of the city.
Come on.

1781
01:54:33,509 --> 01:54:37,093
Yes, I know I am the protector,
but I am a tailor, not a killer.

1782
01:54:37,176 --> 01:54:38,051
Kill her before she wakes up again.

1783
01:54:38,134 --> 01:54:38,718
Take it.

1784
01:54:38,801 --> 01:54:40,134
- Come on.
- Yes.

1785
01:54:41,968 --> 01:54:42,676
Go.

1786
01:55:17,154 --> 01:55:18,426
Do we have to kill her?

1787
01:55:18,953 --> 01:55:20,593
Poor thing is lying
down so comfortably.

1788
01:55:20,801 --> 01:55:22,551
This is exactly how the
people of this city treated her.

1789
01:55:22,676 --> 01:55:23,676
And we're doing the same.

1790
01:55:24,135 --> 01:55:25,509
So what's the difference
between us and them?

1791
01:55:25,718 --> 01:55:26,968
She must have a reason.

1792
01:55:27,343 --> 01:55:29,426
She is trying to find her true love.

1793
01:55:30,426 --> 01:55:31,426
Let her go, please.

1794
01:55:32,676 --> 01:55:33,676
There must be another way.

1795
01:55:33,843 --> 01:55:35,759
Like lizard's tail, cockroach soup.

1796
01:55:40,718 --> 01:55:42,134
Then cut off her braid.

1797
01:55:42,593 --> 01:55:44,134
This will make her powerless.

1798
01:55:44,218 --> 01:55:45,093
And, she won't die either.

1799
01:55:45,971 --> 01:55:46,718
Okay.

1800
01:55:53,884 --> 01:55:55,468
- No, no, no.
- Look into her eyes.

1801
01:55:56,384 --> 01:55:57,426
Find the dagger.

1802
01:55:57,753 --> 01:55:59,051
Look. Look.

1803
01:56:00,222 --> 01:56:01,422
Vicky, open your eyes.

1804
01:56:01,502 --> 01:56:04,111
She won't do anything
if you look in her eyes.

1805
01:56:04,468 --> 01:56:05,551
It's not working.

1806
01:56:05,634 --> 01:56:06,388
She is hungry for love.

1807
01:56:06,468 --> 01:56:07,051
For love...

1808
01:56:07,134 --> 01:56:08,176
Look into her eyes with love.

1809
01:56:09,176 --> 01:56:10,009
Love.

1810
01:56:11,548 --> 01:56:12,468
Love.

1811
01:56:18,884 --> 01:56:19,843
Love...

1812
01:56:20,301 --> 01:56:21,843
More love, Vicky.

1813
01:56:21,968 --> 01:56:24,509
I am shitting in my pants,
and you want more feelings.

1814
01:56:26,426 --> 01:56:27,259
Quiet!

1815
01:56:29,093 --> 01:56:29,843
Quiet!

1816
01:56:30,843 --> 01:56:32,468
What is all this yelling for?

1817
01:56:32,759 --> 01:56:34,426
This is no way to take revenge.

1818
01:56:36,051 --> 01:56:38,009
I am the protector of the city,
so show some respect.

1819
01:56:39,259 --> 01:56:40,176
Always screaming.

1820
01:56:40,843 --> 01:56:41,593
Vicky.

1821
01:56:43,051 --> 01:56:43,676
Here.

1822
01:57:26,718 --> 01:57:27,759
Vicky.

1823
01:57:28,327 --> 01:57:29,759
Throw the braid away.

1824
01:57:32,759 --> 01:57:34,218
Are you okay?

1825
01:57:36,012 --> 01:57:37,301
Yes.

1826
01:57:37,384 --> 01:57:38,884
Dagger.

1827
01:57:42,718 --> 01:57:43,676
Sit up.

1828
01:57:43,759 --> 01:57:45,009
Get up.

1829
01:57:46,051 --> 01:57:47,718
Sit up straight.

1830
01:57:51,426 --> 01:57:53,343
- I think she's gone.
- Yes.

1831
01:57:53,426 --> 01:57:54,051
Isn't it?

1832
01:57:54,975 --> 01:57:57,517
She kept attacking her.

1833
01:57:57,975 --> 01:58:00,142
But I snuck up behind
her and cut off her braid.

1834
01:58:00,350 --> 01:58:01,559
Then she disappeared.

1835
01:58:01,684 --> 01:58:02,267
And didn't come back.

1836
01:58:02,350 --> 01:58:03,767
But is the Stree dead or not?

1837
01:58:05,267 --> 01:58:06,017
Tell me.

1838
01:58:07,684 --> 01:58:09,684
Meaning she will come
back again next year.

1839
01:58:10,274 --> 01:58:14,267
- She's only hungry for one thing.
- No. it's two.

1840
01:58:14,600 --> 01:58:15,142
What?

1841
01:58:16,184 --> 01:58:19,517
Love and respect,
which this city never gave her.

1842
01:58:20,225 --> 01:58:21,809
And that was this
city's biggest mistake.

1843
01:58:22,600 --> 01:58:24,100
And we were going to
repeat the same mistake.

1844
01:58:26,017 --> 01:58:30,059
And if this city gives her
the respect, which she never received.

1845
01:58:31,100 --> 01:58:32,517
Then she might leave us alone.

1846
01:59:08,767 --> 01:59:14,767
These brave men together
have protected the city...

1847
01:59:15,184 --> 01:59:18,517
...and we will never
forget their contribution.

1848
01:59:18,767 --> 01:59:24,434
All the youngsters who went missing
in the last two days have returned.

1849
01:59:24,517 --> 01:59:26,267
Are you listening?

1850
01:59:39,184 --> 01:59:40,559
- There she is.
- Stop. Stop.

1851
01:59:41,059 --> 01:59:42,559
Sister-in-law.

1852
01:59:43,184 --> 01:59:45,100
The flower. The flower.

1853
01:59:45,180 --> 01:59:46,350
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

1854
01:59:47,424 --> 01:59:50,559
Everyone was looking for you.

1855
01:59:53,559 --> 01:59:55,559
You wore the dress.

1856
01:59:56,427 --> 01:59:57,225
Does it fit well?

1857
01:59:58,143 --> 01:59:59,892
You took my measurements so well.

1858
02:00:02,017 --> 02:00:03,975
This is for you.

1859
02:00:04,254 --> 02:00:07,142
I could've never fought
against the Stree without you.

1860
02:00:08,522 --> 02:00:09,392
Thank you.

1861
02:00:11,934 --> 02:00:13,559
You are very nice, Vicky.

1862
02:00:14,174 --> 02:00:16,934
I wish we had met before, then
we could've become friends before.

1863
02:00:18,017 --> 02:00:19,267
Will you be my friend?

1864
02:00:22,434 --> 02:00:25,975
You mean friends, or...

1865
02:00:26,892 --> 02:00:29,267
Yes. Isn't that what friendship means?

1866
02:00:30,495 --> 02:00:31,225
No.

1867
02:00:31,434 --> 02:00:33,698
There's another meaning
for friendship in our town.

1868
02:00:45,322 --> 02:00:48,309
What if I want to talk to you,
or meet you?

1869
02:00:48,392 --> 02:00:49,725
I don't even have your number.

1870
02:00:51,225 --> 02:00:52,392
Just think of me.

1871
02:00:54,809 --> 02:00:56,725
Do you have to go?

1872
02:00:57,059 --> 02:00:58,600
Please wait for a few more days.

1873
02:00:59,582 --> 02:01:00,600
Please.

1874
02:01:02,017 --> 02:01:03,142
Vicky, please!

1875
02:01:18,059 --> 02:01:18,934
Name?

1876
02:01:19,017 --> 02:01:20,600
You didn't tell me your name...

1877
02:01:21,142 --> 02:01:24,767
This is my first time where he's smitten
by love but doesn't know her name.

1878
02:01:24,920 --> 02:01:26,179
Maybe this is true love.

1879
02:01:32,330 --> 02:01:34,767
'For the past three years,
I had only one motive.'

1880
02:01:35,392 --> 02:01:36,642
'Defeating Stree.'

1881
02:01:37,309 --> 02:01:41,517
'I tried everything I knew,
but it wasn't enough.'

1882
02:01:42,309 --> 02:01:45,517
'There's always a method
to control any power.'

1883
02:01:46,225 --> 02:01:47,559
'Just cut off her braid.'

1884
02:01:47,809 --> 02:01:50,684
'She will become powerless,
and won't die.'

1885
02:02:08,184 --> 02:02:11,017
'I would've done
it long ago if I could.'

1886
02:02:11,100 --> 02:02:13,559
'You're the protector of the city,
you have to do it.'

1887
02:02:35,684 --> 02:02:39,309
<font color="#FF0000">ONE YEAR LATER.</font>

1888
02:03:13,184 --> 02:03:15,767
O STREE PROTECT US.
