00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:00,390
Who will decide that?

185
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,720
You.

186
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,520
Then shut up!

187
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,390
Go do your work.

188
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:10,060
Let her be of age to
play with bats and balls.

189
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:12,730
She'll find her way herself.

190
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,600
Guru-ma(Guru-mother)...

191
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:26,610
Does it hurt a lot to get
rid of it through surgery?

192
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,640
They desensitise and do it.

193
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,230
Costs a lot of money?

194
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:38,060
Please tell me...

195
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,400
Name?

196
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:51,890
Mr. & Mrs. Madhu Haldar.

197
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,310
Mr. & Mrs...

198
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:58,100
Madhu Halder.

199
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:01,480
Write your address here.

200
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,720
Write it down. 22/A...

201
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,310
22/A...

202
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:09,220
Hazra Road... Kolkata.

203
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:10,650
Hazra Road...

204
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,300
Kolkata.

205
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,400
Pin code?

206
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:15,430
29.

207
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,940
How many hours?

208
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,860
24 hours. One day.

209
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,600
I'll take this one.

210
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:35,650
That one.

211
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:20,310
Yes, Sir?-
- Don't you clean the room regularly?

212
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:22,850
I'll do it, Sir.-
- Beer bottles lying here.

213
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:27,230
The table's full of leftovers. Clean it.-
- Sure, Sir.

214
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,440
It's very dirty.

215
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,650
Sit.

216
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:51,850
Guru-ma is calling
every half an hour.

217
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:55,140
Sandhya-di too called once.

218
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:58,940
What if you go back now?

219
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,270
What then?

220
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,190
They'll beat the hell out
of me, what else!?

221
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:06,720
We're not to leave
without informing.

222
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,850
She's got a tough
palm, like men.

223
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:16,760
A tight slap from her...
and you'll completely black out.

224
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:22,060
It is so hot today! I must
open the wig...

225
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,930
No way!

226
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,940
Until you grow your own hair...

227
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:31,270
keep wearing it!

228
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,760
Do you like straight hair?

229
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:55,440
Or a shot haircut?

230
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:57,150
This is nice.

231
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:03,850
My real hair is curly.

232
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,350
But I can...

233
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,940
Move your leg...

234
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:11,430
I'll get it straightened if you want.

235
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,730
What are you looking at?

236
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:22,680
Nothing.

237
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:29,940
Always come to me dressed up.

238
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,470
I don't like seeing the
patchwork.

239
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,690
Come as Puti!

240
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,940
Hey!

241
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:06,690
Are you going somewhere?

242
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:08,980
Bought an apartment
at Ballygunje area.

243
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,520
Can't live here anymore.

244
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,300
Have you read that notice?

245
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:14,300
Read it!

246
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:29,680
♪ If you don't vacate by the 26th,
no compensations will be given ♪

247
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:45,060
Where to?

248
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,800
Nearby.

249
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:49,360
I'll get us some food.

250
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,510
You take a bath and get dressed.-
- Okay.

251
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:56,980
Lock the door.

252
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,020
Okay.

253
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:09,470
Come on? Lock it!

254
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,730
I will knock thrice, okay?

255
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,060
Like this.

256
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,800
Only then you open.
Don't open it for others.

257
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:19,010
Lock it.

258
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:26,310
You're exactly like Subhash-da.

259
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,770
Who is that?

260
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:29,680
Nobody. He was a teacher.

261
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:31,260
Lock the door.

262
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:36,310
Come back soon.

263
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,510
Don't you have a
matching bodice?

264
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,310
Hey...

265
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:19,770
No.

266
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:21,550
Sujata...-
- Yes?

267
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,760
Take her to the South today.

268
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:24,850
Okay.

269
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:27,100
Have you seen this?

270
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:29,550
What are you ogling at?

271
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,850
Mala took a selfie with Ishan.

272
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:34,800
Who is Ishan?-
- From, 'Jamai Raja'.

273
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:35,760
The TV soap.

274
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:37,510
Look?-
- Show me.

275
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:42,260
His car was at the signal.
Gave her a 100 rupee note.

276
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,930
Let me see!

277
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:47,900
Oh! This is the actor,
Sabyasachi's son!

278
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,890
His real name is Arjun!

279
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:50,930
Look!

280
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:52,350
Isn't he cool?

281
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:55,230
Hey...

282
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:57,310
Won't you pay me back?-
- In 2 days...

283
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,980
The landlord, the owners...

284
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,980
everyone has given the N.O.C.

285
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,310
In exchange of a big sum.

286
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:06,100
Surely not alone. They
must've had to share.

287
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:09,230
The political party, the police...
The local club's there too.

288
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:10,940
Mr. Prashanta comes
every evening.

289
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:14,560
He's spoke to Ratan...-
- Madhu, give me a matchstick...

290
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,510
Asked him to send the
names of who refuse.

291
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:20,270
We're fake tenants. No papers.

292
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:23,600
I was born in this slum, Madhu.

293
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,100
Where will I go now at this age?

294
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:30,800
They're asking us to leave
the rooms in four days.

295
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,890
Oh God!

296
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,230
Come.

297
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,970
Let's see what happens.

298
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:56,150
Whom do you want?

299
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:59,310
Is Priyanka Chopra here?

300
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:00,940
Why?

301
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,050
Want to take a selfie?

302
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,890
Come.

303
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:25,610
Hey, Sir, spare a ten rupee note!

304
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:31,150
Ten rupees?

305
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:07,110
I'll be there in two minutes.

306
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:25,650
Who is this Subhash-da
you mentioned?

307
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,300
Never heard of him before.

308
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:30,720
I told you...

309
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:32,890
He used to teach.

310
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,930
He used to give tuitions.

311
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,110
To my elder sister.

312
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,180
To me.

313
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:42,980
What did he teach?

314
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,980
He taught me many things.

315
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,800
How far, brother?

316
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:00,810
Gokul-da doesn't have a mobile.

317
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:03,260
Ask him to call me.

318
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:05,220
For sure, okay?

319
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:06,390
Number?

320
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,470
He has mine.

321
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:11,770
Tell him, I've a serious problem.

322
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,560
What happened?

323
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:18,360
My ancestral house is in Nabadwip.

324
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,520
I've rented a room in a slum here.

325
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,260
600 bucks along with
electric charges.

326
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,190
I only go back to sleep.

327
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:27,900
I'm busy delivering for
the Chinese hotel all day.

328
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:32,360
And when I get called to
play at the Kirtan...

329
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:35,140
then I'm usually not back
before 11 pm.

330
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,940
I only go back to eat
and sleep off.

331
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:40,270
I need at least a room for myself.

332
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,900
The promoters are
bringing it down.

333
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:45,760
They'll build high-rises there.

334
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,730
There you go...

335
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:50,110
Yes...

336
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:52,440
Yes, I'm coming.
Got a flat tyre.

337
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,810
I'm coming.

338
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,260
Tell him it's urgent, okay?

339
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,680
I think we've reached.

340
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:16,060
Where to?-
- The College Principal's office.

341
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:18,600
You have appointment?-
- Of course!

342
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,140
Mushroom Asparagus.
Mixed Manchurian Hakka.

343
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,860
Okay. Go.

344
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:27,230
Good morning. Come.

345
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:31,360
What was that!-
- Just walk.

346
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:35,310
Please do not cross the barricade.

347
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:38,050
Let the police do their job.

348
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,730
Did you collect all your luggage?-
- It's kept there.

349
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:57,270
I hardly have any.

350
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:51,390
I will do the talking first.

351
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,810
If she asks anything, reply.

352
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:00,440
Should we tell her we eloped?-
- Absolutely!

353
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,610
She will catch us if we lie!

354
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:06,760
Stand up!

355
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,980
Please sit.

356
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:28,720
You two seem quite young.

357
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:31,060
This year's admissions are over.

358
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,110
What's your name?

359
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:37,220
I am Madhu. She is Puti.

360
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:39,140
Puti?

361
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,810
And your proper name?

362
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:42,940
My proper name...

363
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,150
Parimal.

364
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:47,440
From that it became Pari and...

365
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:49,310
And now it's Puti.

366
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:52,150
'Puti' as in 'tiny'?

367
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:53,430
No...

368
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,610
She always gets a 'put' (single)
point in the dice game.

369
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,800
That why, 'Puti'.

370
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:03,560
Usually they call our
kind, 'Chhakka' (sixer).

371
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:06,690
But our own lives are...

372
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:08,650
only a single person's path.

373
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,900
Madam...

374
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:15,350
I've eloped with Madhu-da.

375
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,730
I used to live with the eunuchs
at the Nimtala area of Kolkata.

376
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:23,060
What's your Guru's name?

377
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:24,310
Reply.

378
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:26,430
Arati.

379
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,430
Why have you come to me?

380
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:33,050
I've seen on the Television, you...

381
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:35,430
turned into Manabi from Somnath.

382
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:38,360
Puti is a girl. From her heart.

383
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,680
But her body... if we could...

384
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,650
make it a female body... then...

385
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,480
that's why...

386
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,360
Yes, Madam?

387
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,810
Take them to my quarter.-
- Okay.

388
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:04,890
You're great, Madam.

389
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:07,520
A complete lady!

390
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:10,310
Really!-
- Go, I'll come.

391
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:12,230
Take them with you.

392
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:12,900
Go.

393
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:13,980
Let's go.

394
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:17,560
Put this to dry.

395
00:34:57,230 --> 00:35:00,650
Have they broken all the houses?

396
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:05,930
So, from now you will...

397
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:06,940
stay here?

398
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,190
Not quite.

399
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:11,810
As long as I don't find a place.
I've to find a place near Hazra.

400
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:14,180
The hotel is close from there.

401
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:18,440
God will mend everything.

402
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,060
Trust me.

403
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,400
Thank you.

404
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:27,430
Why?

405
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,900
Because you remembered
to tell Gokul-da.

406
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:32,930
It was a big help.

407
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:35,230
Big help.

408
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:40,480
Why that dry thank you?
Give me a treat.

409
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:43,300
With your Chinese food?

410
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:47,350
The smile isn't enough.

411
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,230
No free lunches.

412
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,100
Puti...

413
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:55,640
My name.

414
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,760
Hey, Puti...

415
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:04,890
Puti...

416
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,020
Coming!

417
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:22,930
Today, Manabi Bandopadhyay is
officially a woman.

418
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:26,980
But the lady professors of the
college wouldn't let me into the loo.

419
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:31,900
They will slap it on your
face, what's real and what's fake!

420
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:36,060
Becoming a woman doesn't mean
you'll become a heroine for them!

421
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,550
One plate chicken fried rice.

422
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:40,720
One plate boneless chilli chicken.

423
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:43,350
135 B, Beltala Road.

424
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:45,190
It's a little urgent, okay?

425
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,730
And listen...

426
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,150
Make that an egg fried rice.

427
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:51,650
Thank for the help, brother.

428
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:14,010
So, why have you come to
Krishnanagar, Lord Krishna?

429
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:18,260
If Puti becomes a woman,
will you marry her?

430
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:22,520
Or will you too run away
like my husband did?

431
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:25,220
Not at all, Madam! I swear on God!

432
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:30,690
My husband used to
swear on God as well!

433
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:43,430
Should I go?-
- No...

434
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,610
You just came back.

435
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:47,480
The heat is terrible
today. Take this...

436
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,050
Yes, it's too much.

437
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:58,800
Many people go to Bihar
for a cheap surgery.

438
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:02,430
Then they get ruined
by the quack doctors.

439
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,900
I know many who have
died like this.

440
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:08,230
You see, the cost is huge.
And a prolonged treatment.

441
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:12,150
It's not over with the surgery.
They'll continue hormone treatments.

442
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:14,610
I'm still on hormone treatments.

443
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,680
Even now?

444
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:20,230
If you want to do it
cheap, then suit yourself.

445
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,260
Wait, I'll show you something.

446
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:23,720
Madhu-da...

447
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:28,400
You know, clay dolls of
Krishnanagar are world famous.

448
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:32,730
They must do a job
as intricate as this.

449
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:37,220
They must build a woman's
body bit by bit, just like God.

450
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:39,980
I am giving this to you.

451
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:42,100
Keep this with yourself.

452
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,060
Don't get bogged down
because you're a eunuch.

453
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:22,260
I am the head of a college today.

454
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,560
Right?

455
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:26,430
This is my biography.

456
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:27,900
Do read it.

457
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:36,010
Please teach her to be
just like you.

458
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:37,770
How far has she studied?

459
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,550
Till the 7th standard.

460
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:42,940
Academics isn't my cup of tea.

461
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:44,390
So...

462
00:39:44,810 --> 00:39:46,860
in order to become a
woman completely...

463
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:50,730
as in, for a full body surgery...
how much will it cost?

464
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:52,020
No, wait.

465
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,300
Tell me how much
half the body will take?

466
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:57,220
Tell me the price
separately, top and bottom.

467
00:39:57,310 --> 00:40:00,190
Oh come on...-
- We'll do it as and when we have money.

468
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:02,810
In instalments.
Not possible?

469
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,480
Is it very painful?

470
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:10,140
The pain you're living with,

471
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:12,690
it's nothing compared to that, Puti.

472
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,440
Not again...

473
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:31,730
Have...

474
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:37,890
I'll go.

475
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:38,930
Stop!

476
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,650
I will go.

477
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:48,430
Biting off more than
you can chew!?

478
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,390
Don't argue back.

479
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:15,220
Listen...

480
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:22,720
We too are quite fond of Chinese.

481
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:25,020
If you want to give a treat...

482
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:27,400
we're ten of us.

483
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:33,720
Do not go for a separate plan.

484
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,890
Go.

485
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:41,060
My heart loses All patience here

486
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:45,360
Eager, she sets out

487
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:50,890
To the sound of his flute

488
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:52,900
Eager, she sets out

489
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:57,480
To the sound of his flute

490
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,230
Eager, she sets out

491
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:03,980
To the sound of his flute

492
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:07,610
My heart loses All patience here

493
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:10,270
Eager, she sets out

494
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:17,190
Drenched in the
Sound of the flute

495
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:21,470
O, the plight of dear Radha!

496
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,440
Stop crying and eat.

497
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:27,930
Everything will be fine.

498
00:42:32,770 --> 00:42:33,860
Here...

499
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:34,980
Eat.

500
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:44,520
We will never have so much money.

501
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,940
Told you, I will arrange for it.

502
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:52,270
I will save up every month.

503
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:59,020
I have two golden rings.

504
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,390
It won't be enough.

505
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:04,980
Come on...

506
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:08,650
I have my share of land
back at home.

507
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:10,510
At Nabadwip.

508
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,350
The land of Mahaprabhu Chaitanya.

509
00:43:14,850 --> 00:43:17,260
It'll bear a lot of
money if I sell it.

510
00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:19,310
Here.

511
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,260
Have it.-
- I will. You eat.

512
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:23,430
Sharing food once is unlucky.

513
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:26,310
Finish eating and pack
up the bags.

514
00:43:28,770 --> 00:43:30,190
Come on.

515
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,430
We'll leave tomorrow.

516
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:36,510
Where are we going?

517
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:37,890
Nabadwip.

518
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:40,600
We'll take a bus and
then a ferry from there.

519
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:48,940
Where will we stay?

520
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:50,600
At my place.

521
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:56,520
Will they take us in?

522
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:13,310
The sweet sound of his flute
Touches my ears

523
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:19,520
My heart loses All patience here

524
00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:27,850
The sweet sound of his flute
Touches my ears

525
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:33,940
My heart loses All patience here

526
00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:37,760
Eager, she sets out

527
00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:44,400
Drenched in the
Sound of the flute

528
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:48,230
Hello, Chinese Wall?

529
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:50,810
Yes, please take it down.

530
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:52,100
One plate chowmein...

531
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:53,680
Yes.

532
00:44:53,770 --> 00:44:54,770
Do that.

533
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:57,860
And a plate of
chilli chicken with that.

534
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:00,440
Write down. 301...

535
00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:01,730
Hazra lane.

536
00:45:02,350 --> 00:45:03,680
Yes, ground floor.

537
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:08,350
Please make it fast.
I'm in hurry, okay?

538
00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:10,930
Please make it fast.

539
00:45:11,930 --> 00:45:12,970
Okay. Okay, fine.

540
00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:18,050
People mostly worship
Goddess Kali or Durga.

541
00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:19,400
But my God is...

542
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:20,690
Shri Chaitanya.

543
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,270
They married him off forcefully.

544
00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:25,220
What good did it do?

545
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:27,800
His wife, Bishnupriya
would cry all day.

546
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:30,400
Her husband wasn't
interested in the home.

547
00:45:30,810 --> 00:45:32,270
And why would he be?

548
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:35,270
He had given up his
heart, his life, his body...

549
00:45:35,350 --> 00:45:38,350
everything for Lord Shri Krishna.

550
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,890
Drowning himself in
Krishna's love as his lover, Radha.

551
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:44,300
Take care of Him.

552
00:46:37,310 --> 00:46:39,610
My stomach is aching.-
- What some medicine?

553
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:42,220
Let me wait a bit.

554
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:45,270
No... I' must go to the loo.

555
00:46:45,310 --> 00:46:47,400
I've to go again.-
- Go.

556
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:51,150
All that Chinese food
didn't go down too well...

557
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,980
Let me carry it.-
- It's okay.

558
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,470
Come, sit here.

559
00:47:29,270 --> 00:47:31,150
No problem, right?-
- Not at all.

560
00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:07,610
I ordered for it.

561
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:31,900
You left for the land of Mathura
O Krishna dear

562
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:38,600
You left for the land of Mathura

563
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:44,470
All of Vrindavan cries
All houses and families howl for you

564
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:50,430
All of Vrindavan cries
All houses and families howl for you

565
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:54,220
They wander crying out
your name, Kanu

566
00:48:54,350 --> 00:48:55,390
Poor them

567
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:00,060
They wander crying out
your name, Kanu

568
00:49:00,850 --> 00:49:01,890
Poor them

569
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:04,900
All of them cry out today

570
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:08,510
All of them cry out today

571
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:12,140
O Krishna, in your name

572
00:49:12,270 --> 00:49:15,110
Brother... where is
Madhu-da's house?

573
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:16,680
That way.-
- Thank you.

574
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:20,970
All the land cries

575
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:26,520
Dear Yashomati's son
Darkness lurks your lawn today

576
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:32,270
Your parents can't hold their own!
Poor them!

577
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:38,350
Your parents can't hold their own!
Poor them!

578
00:49:47,270 --> 00:49:48,270
What happened?

579
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:51,440
What happened?

580
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,890
Why did you get scared
and leave?

581
00:49:57,140 --> 00:49:58,850
I was anyway looking for a house.

582
00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:02,050
Scared of a scandal?-
- Yes, that too.

583
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:05,100
Well, let there be one.

584
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:11,440
Who is she to control you?

585
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:13,810
Is she your Guru?

586
00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:17,980
Who you'll be friends with...

587
00:50:19,730 --> 00:50:22,810
will she decide that for you?

588
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:28,930
Why are you so scared?

589
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:32,690
Would I have texted you
this address if I was scared?

590
00:50:34,930 --> 00:50:37,010
Do you love me?

591
00:50:38,890 --> 00:50:41,050
As in?

592
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:43,650
But I love you.

593
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,730
Don't you feel like seeing me?

594
00:50:49,230 --> 00:50:50,360
That I do.

595
00:50:50,430 --> 00:50:51,850
That's it.

596
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:54,560
That's it!

597
00:50:55,810 --> 00:50:58,440
You do love me.
You've caught feelings.

598
00:50:59,350 --> 00:51:01,800
That's why you got
scared and fled.

599
00:51:03,350 --> 00:51:05,930
Not our Guru...

600
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:10,350
You're scared of yourself, Madhu-da.

601
00:51:11,390 --> 00:51:15,300
But I am fighting the crocodile
staying in the water.

602
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:19,770
You're still on land, Madhu-da!

603
00:51:19,794 --> 00:51:49,794

605
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:15,980
Won't it be a problem at home?

606
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:18,520
Had to face it some day.

607
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:24,050
I work at the hotel, that's all.

608
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:27,850
No need to talk about
the home delivery bit.

609
00:53:28,430 --> 00:53:30,600
A big hotel. That's it.

610
00:53:32,430 --> 00:53:34,890
They'll ask a hundred questions.

611
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:37,860
If you think you're in trouble,

612
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:39,640
pretend to be lost in thought.

613
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:43,220
Just start crying. Tell them
you're missing your home.

614
00:53:43,350 --> 00:53:44,720
This is no joke.

615
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:46,350
Be careful.

616
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:04,940
What if they ask my
parents' names?

617
00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:07,310
Say the truth.

618
00:54:07,770 --> 00:54:09,810
Malay Dutta, Rekha Dutta,

619
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:12,260
My sister, Reena.

620
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:14,050
And me...

621
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:20,440
Guru-ma hasn't given
me a proper name yet.

622
00:54:21,230 --> 00:54:23,360
She used to call me Pari.

623
00:54:24,890 --> 00:54:27,680
Your sister's called Reena...

624
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:30,180
Rinku. Rinku Dutta.

625
00:54:30,810 --> 00:54:31,940
Rinku Dutta.

626
00:54:36,430 --> 00:54:39,220
You mustn't call me
'Puti' by mistake.

627
00:54:39,390 --> 00:54:42,050
That could be my
personal name for you.

628
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:45,470
People have names for loved
ones... Buchu, Kutli, Gutli...

629
00:54:45,810 --> 00:54:47,230
Like that.

630
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:49,560
For me, it's Puti.

631
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:07,810
Your Guru will give
you a good shelling.

632
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:10,690
You're sneaking out to
meet me everyday!

633
00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:14,100
But you're doing that
too, right?

634
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:24,550
Only if she gets to know.

635
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:28,690
People give us weird stares
even around your home.

636
00:55:29,930 --> 00:55:32,510
Soon the club will intervene.

637
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:35,140
This place is far better.

638
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:40,550
Whatever fate has to offer.

639
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:43,610
Some lovers romance
sitting at Victoria memorial.

640
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:48,010
And we're smelling crap here
standing beside the drain.

641
00:55:49,350 --> 00:55:50,760
Hey.

642
00:55:52,270 --> 00:55:54,190
What are you thinking?

643
00:55:56,180 --> 00:55:57,850
Nothing...

644
00:55:58,350 --> 00:56:00,220
What 'nothing'?

645
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:02,850
Of course you're thinking.
Spill it out.

646
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:09,730
Is this really possible?

647
00:56:10,770 --> 00:56:13,400
Between two males...

648
00:56:15,730 --> 00:56:17,900
Can two boys fall for
each other?

649
00:56:17,930 --> 00:56:19,470
Well it's happening!

650
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:24,550
You leave your work and come.

651
00:56:25,890 --> 00:56:28,640
I am also taking the risk to come.

652
00:56:28,770 --> 00:56:29,770
Why?

653
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:33,020
Because it is happening.

654
00:56:38,890 --> 00:56:41,180
Please be honest, Madhu-da...

655
00:56:46,350 --> 00:56:49,470
When we were making out...

656
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:53,520
did you feel like I was a boy?

657
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:58,520
Because I am actually
a girl, Madhu-da!

658
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:03,860
They couldn't make me a boy just
by making me wear a shirt and pants.

659
00:57:04,430 --> 00:57:06,430
I've been like this since birth!

660
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:08,190
A girl.

661
00:57:10,730 --> 00:57:12,230
I have the wrong body.

662
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:15,190
I've to make it right.

663
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:21,110
When we made mistakes in math,
we'd calculate it again...

664
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:22,470
Just like that.

665
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,760
I'm not getting a
haircut these days!

666
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,400
I've a good mop.
See?

667
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:32,180
It's become so long!

668
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:35,930
I'll make it reach my
shoulders in a year.

669
00:57:36,770 --> 00:57:38,150
Please look!

670
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:52,520
Once I make a nice
parting with a braid,

671
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:59,140
you won't be able to look away!

672
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:06,100
What's my fault here?

673
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:08,190
Wear the hair.

674
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:19,140
Until your hair grows long don't
open it in front of me, Puti.

675
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:22,640
Never do that.

676
00:58:26,180 --> 00:58:27,640
I don't like it.

677
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:34,980
Please help me a little,
Madhu-da!

678
00:58:35,730 --> 00:58:39,980
I will make all the
calculations right for you.

679
00:58:42,810 --> 00:58:47,940
There won't remain even an inch
of Parimal left in this body.

680
00:58:56,850 --> 00:59:00,800
Give me your phone. And take mine.

681
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:08,050
Is your father hot tempered?-
- No...

682
00:59:08,430 --> 00:59:09,930
My brother is the serious kind.

683
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:14,050
But no anger. They're very calm people.
Otherwise I wouldn't bring you.

684
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:15,720
Who else is there at home?

685
00:59:15,770 --> 00:59:18,520
My brother's wife and
her son, Gaja. He is six.

686
00:59:18,770 --> 00:59:21,560
Hope you know how to cook?-
- Yes.

687
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:26,430
Fish, chicken, veggies, eggs...-
- We're Vaishnavas! Vegetarians!

688
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:29,270
Not even onions or eggs! Only
lentils, rice and fried veggies.

689
00:59:29,310 --> 00:59:31,900
But you lapped up all
the meat in the hotel!

690
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:34,350
You can't maintain
all that in the city!

691
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:38,480
Don't ever bring it up at home.
Maa will throw us out right away!

692
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:40,650
What will you say if
they ask about me?

693
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:42,600
I will say the truth.
You're my friend.

694
00:59:43,020 --> 00:59:44,110
A friend...

695
00:59:44,890 --> 00:59:47,600
Actually, say it in English,
sounds better. Girlfriend.

696
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:49,350
Girlfriend?

697
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:03,470
You ordered at Chinese Wall.-
- Wait.

698
01:00:04,060 --> 01:00:07,020
Madam was waiting for
you. Went for a bath.

699
01:00:07,140 --> 01:00:09,300
She'll come out and pay.-
- Water please?

700
01:00:09,350 --> 01:00:10,050
Okay.

701
01:00:10,230 --> 01:00:15,900
If the human being is not a man from
his thinking, his soul, his heart...

702
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:18,510
The woman inside him
chocks to death...

703
01:00:18,850 --> 01:00:20,600
Like a shackled Goddess.

704
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:23,600
Such a life is rather a curse.

705
01:00:24,390 --> 01:00:27,010
Even though Somnath
had admirers, he was alone.

706
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:29,470
Water.-
- When he became Manabi...

707
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:31,260
Please switch on the fan.

708
01:00:31,390 --> 01:00:33,890
She found the river to flow in.

709
01:00:34,060 --> 01:00:37,560
That's how I felt complete.
I could flow like a river.

710
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:39,390
May the woman inside you...

711
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:41,980
come out to your body...

712
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:43,800
What you want...

713
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:46,020
when you look at yourself
in the mirror...

714
01:00:46,270 --> 01:00:50,360
You want to see a beautiful
woman's reflection to be created.

715
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:54,110
The woman you have been
hiding inside you since childhood,

716
01:00:54,350 --> 01:00:56,510
the child of your
thought process,

717
01:00:56,730 --> 01:00:58,190
who is you in totality,

718
01:00:58,230 --> 01:00:59,730
bring that 'You'...

719
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:01,800
out in the open.

720
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:15,560
Hello?

721
01:01:18,810 --> 01:01:19,900
Hello?

722
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:21,230
Speak louder...

723
01:01:21,890 --> 01:01:26,300
Don't listen to them. Take
advice form an educated person.

724
01:01:26,890 --> 01:01:28,510
Speak to someone who knows.

725
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:31,270
You won't believe your eyes,
Madam used to be a man!

726
01:01:31,350 --> 01:01:34,300
They're showing her
pictures of before and after.

727
01:01:35,270 --> 01:01:36,310
Yes.

728
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:39,230
She is the Principal of
Krishnanagar College.

729
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:42,470
I know where it is, I will
take you to Krishnanagar.

730
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:44,680
A complete woman's body!

731
01:01:44,770 --> 01:01:46,400
Don't worry about the cost.

732
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:49,020
My home's at Nabadwip.
It's on the same route!

733
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:49,850
Yes.

734
01:01:50,100 --> 01:01:51,100
That's what I am saying!

735
01:01:51,124 --> 01:02:21,124
<font color="#00ff00">Complete Subtitles Exclusively Arranged by:-</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Samaksh ~ Varsha ~ Pankaj Jain</font>

736
01:03:18,980 --> 01:03:20,440
Come, fast!

737
01:03:21,810 --> 01:03:23,360
Let's go!

738
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:37,180
Thamma! (Grandma)

739
01:03:38,850 --> 01:03:40,010
Thamma!

740
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:41,180
What is it?

741
01:03:41,270 --> 01:03:42,360
Why are you shouting?

742
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:43,940
I will tell Thamma.

743
01:03:44,060 --> 01:03:46,560
Tell me what it is?-
- What is it?

744
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:48,440
Chhotka. (Uncle)

745
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:49,640
Chhotka?

746
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:52,860
What about him?-
- Chhotka is here!

747
01:03:53,140 --> 01:03:54,430
There's a girl with him!

748
01:04:24,270 --> 01:04:26,150
Hark Lord Krishna.-
- Yes.

749
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:29,350
Hark, Lord Krishna.-
- Hark, Lord Krishna!

750
01:04:35,270 --> 01:04:37,310
How are you?-
- Bless you.

751
01:04:37,430 --> 01:04:38,930
My mother.

752
01:04:39,390 --> 01:04:41,430
My blessing to you, dear.

753
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:43,190
May Lord Krishna bless you.

754
01:04:43,890 --> 01:04:45,260
My Dada (elder brother).

755
01:04:46,020 --> 01:04:47,230
No...

756
01:04:50,060 --> 01:04:54,020
Look at you, Thakurpo(brother-in-law)!
Couldn't you call once?

757
01:04:54,060 --> 01:04:55,940
Boudi(sister-in-law).
She is Rinku.

758
01:04:56,310 --> 01:04:57,060
Seek blessings.

759
01:04:57,180 --> 01:04:58,260
That's enough.

760
01:04:58,310 --> 01:04:59,770
May Lord Krishna bless you.

761
01:04:59,810 --> 01:05:00,650
Who is she?

762
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:01,680
My friend.

763
01:05:02,270 --> 01:05:05,310
Really? She's got
such a pretty face!

764
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:08,640
Should I cook or have you eaten?-
- We ate at the ferry-station.

765
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:09,430
Give me some water.

766
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:10,520
Yes.

767
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:12,350
Sit. I'll be back.

768
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:16,140
Dada.

769
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:21,800
What are you staring at?
Seek blessings!

770
01:05:21,890 --> 01:05:23,470
May Radha and Krishna bless you!

771
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:24,860
Please sit, dear.

772
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:31,970
Sit.

773
01:05:33,770 --> 01:05:35,980
What's wrong with this harmonium?

774
01:05:36,270 --> 01:05:40,520
What's wrong with it?-
- One key is acting up.

775
01:05:45,140 --> 01:05:48,350
Rinku had some work at
Krishnanagar. We came from there.

776
01:05:48,430 --> 01:05:50,510
She really...
Hey Raja... come here!

777
01:05:51,060 --> 01:05:52,900
He is always running around.

778
01:05:53,350 --> 01:05:56,350
What work did you have at Krishnanagar?-
- Her sister's place.

779
01:05:56,430 --> 01:05:57,760
She couldn't come alone.

780
01:05:57,810 --> 01:05:59,020
So I brought her.

781
01:06:03,890 --> 01:06:05,680
Seems there's a show tonight?

782
01:06:05,810 --> 01:06:09,190
It's Holi festival tomorrow. There's a
Kirtan programme at the Ray Choudhury's.

783
01:06:14,730 --> 01:06:16,360
Did you get your flute?-
- Yes.

784
01:06:16,890 --> 01:06:18,760
Will you play today?-
- Yes.

785
01:06:18,810 --> 01:06:20,440
Of course.

786
01:06:20,930 --> 01:06:22,720
Chhotka, Maa is calling you.

787
01:06:28,390 --> 01:06:30,760
Weren't you eager to
listen to Kirtan? Wish granted.

788
01:06:30,850 --> 01:06:32,260
I'll take you today.

789
01:06:36,850 --> 01:06:38,010
Dear...

790
01:06:38,850 --> 01:06:40,390
Where's your home?

791
01:06:42,060 --> 01:06:43,060
Bagnan.

792
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:49,180
Today,

793
01:06:49,350 --> 01:06:51,760
on the anniversary of
Indian independence...

794
01:06:51,810 --> 01:06:54,480
the Bagnan Sporting
Club has organised...

795
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:57,190
the all day long programme
for everybody.

796
01:06:57,430 --> 01:06:59,720
In the children's category,

797
01:06:59,770 --> 01:07:03,520
the results of the Go As
You Like competition, will be...

798
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:05,650
will be announced now!

799
01:07:05,770 --> 01:07:08,110
Today's theme was 'Patriotism'.

800
01:07:08,180 --> 01:07:11,100
You can see how our
little friends have...

801
01:07:11,180 --> 01:07:14,010
dressed up as the
various heroes of our nation.

802
01:07:14,230 --> 01:07:16,520
Give them a huge
applause, everyone!

803
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:18,650
I shall announce the results now!

804
01:07:18,730 --> 01:07:21,770
The child who acquired
the first place is...

805
01:07:22,310 --> 01:07:23,520
Parimal.

806
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:24,800
Parimal Dutta.

807
01:07:24,890 --> 01:07:26,470
He has dressed up as
Mother Sarada.

808
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:28,430
A big round of applause please!

809
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:30,220
Come, son.

810
01:07:30,770 --> 01:07:34,690
Let us give you your award!
Parimal's sister is bringing him.

811
01:07:34,930 --> 01:07:39,180
We have the President of the district
committee of Bagnan to give the award.

812
01:07:39,310 --> 01:07:41,310
Mr. Amitabha Ghosh!

813
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:43,980
Everyone, please give Parimal a
huge round of applause!

814
01:07:48,270 --> 01:07:49,480
What is it?

815
01:07:50,060 --> 01:07:52,020
Am I guessing it right?

816
01:07:52,350 --> 01:07:54,930
How will I know what you're
guessing? Where's the matchbox?

817
01:07:55,060 --> 01:07:57,190
Don't act smart now, tell me!

818
01:07:57,270 --> 01:07:59,560
Where's the matchbox?
Over there!

819
01:08:00,140 --> 01:08:03,760
Your mother and brother are
leaving for the Kirtan. Wait a little.

820
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:12,100
How old is she?
Looks like a kid!

821
01:08:12,310 --> 01:08:13,650
No, she is 18. Adult!

822
01:08:13,730 --> 01:08:15,770
Brilliant! What else?

823
01:08:15,930 --> 01:08:17,850
Jump into it!-
- Quiet, please!

824
01:08:18,230 --> 01:08:19,980
Why are you so scared?

825
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:22,230
I am there.

826
01:08:22,350 --> 01:08:24,300
Where is Baba(father)?-
- At the temple.

827
01:08:24,390 --> 01:08:25,390
Come.

828
01:08:30,310 --> 01:08:31,860
You know, dear...

829
01:08:31,980 --> 01:08:34,610
our family has been singing
Kirtans for three generations now.

830
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:36,680
You know Kirtans?-
- Yes.

831
01:08:36,770 --> 01:08:40,610
My younger son too learnt the
Kirtan and flute in the family itself.

832
01:08:40,850 --> 01:08:43,850
We sing Kirtans for a living.-
- Here, water.

833
01:08:45,230 --> 01:08:47,730
Madhu was the first one
to enter a different profession.

834
01:08:47,890 --> 01:08:50,010
He said he wanted to go to
Kolkata to find a job.

835
01:08:50,270 --> 01:08:52,360
Times are changing, you see.

836
01:08:52,430 --> 01:08:55,100
Kirtan singers aren't as respected
or sought after like earlier.

837
01:08:55,180 --> 01:08:56,640
But I do play there.

838
01:08:56,980 --> 01:08:59,900
There's one group at Kalighat.
Very few shows though.

839
01:09:00,230 --> 01:09:01,520
Funerals, etc.

840
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:04,350
Sometimes shows come from the
village areas. Nungi, Champahati,

841
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:06,350
Nepalganj, New Barrackpore, that's it.

842
01:09:07,140 --> 01:09:08,390
Is it a big group?

843
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:11,510
More or less. Many people play.
Two for each instrument.

844
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:13,110
Two flutes, two Khol drums.

845
01:09:13,140 --> 01:09:14,140
But one violin.

846
01:09:14,230 --> 01:09:16,440
The lady has a very nice voice.
Hey... Gaja...

847
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:17,560
Go keep the glass.

848
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:20,220
Hey, Gaja, please take
aunt's glass too.

849
01:09:20,270 --> 01:09:21,400
Yes, son.

850
01:09:25,430 --> 01:09:27,260
Have you heard Madhu play?

851
01:09:28,890 --> 01:09:30,050
Yes.

852
01:09:31,060 --> 01:09:32,230
Hey...

853
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:34,060
When did you hear?

854
01:09:34,390 --> 01:09:36,180
Why? At our place?

855
01:09:37,390 --> 01:09:38,680
Near Gokul-da's room.

856
01:09:38,810 --> 01:09:41,900
Good lord! You've been
to her house already?

857
01:09:41,930 --> 01:09:44,680
You all were so
worried about the boy...

858
01:09:44,730 --> 01:09:47,690
because some astrologer
said he won't have a family life...

859
01:09:47,730 --> 01:09:50,860
The lad's doing it all!-
- Chuck this for now.

860
01:09:51,060 --> 01:09:52,610
Maa, let's go.

861
01:09:57,730 --> 01:09:59,190
How long are you here?

862
01:09:59,310 --> 01:10:01,020
Only two days.
We'll go tomorrow.

863
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:03,260
But it's Holi (festival
of colours) tomorrow.

864
01:10:03,310 --> 01:10:05,980
You won't find transport.
Go day after.

865
01:10:06,020 --> 01:10:07,690
Yes, actually, listen...

866
01:10:08,140 --> 01:10:12,100
There's a lady with you. Everyone
will be drunk. Don't go tomorrow.

867
01:10:12,140 --> 01:10:13,260
Maa, let's go.

868
01:10:13,310 --> 01:10:14,400
We're coming too.

869
01:10:14,890 --> 01:10:15,970
Let's go.

870
01:10:18,850 --> 01:10:23,430
Hark, Lord Krishna.-
- Careful.

871
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:26,010
Gaja, hurry up.

872
01:10:26,100 --> 01:10:29,390
Will you take a bath?-
- No, I bathed in the morning.

873
01:10:29,980 --> 01:10:30,810
Okay. Fine.

874
01:10:30,850 --> 01:10:32,350
Just freshen up a bit then.

875
01:10:32,890 --> 01:10:35,510
Sleep with me tonight.
We don't have extra rooms.

876
01:10:36,310 --> 01:10:38,110
Gaja... go fast!

877
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:40,970
The brothers will sleep here.
You can sleep with me.

878
01:10:41,020 --> 01:10:42,020
Listen...

879
01:10:42,060 --> 01:10:43,520
hope her parents are
okay with this?

880
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:45,550
As in?

881
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:46,600
As in...

882
01:10:47,230 --> 01:10:49,440
do her parents know
you brought her here?

883
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:52,180
What do you think?-
- Okay, nothing, Go in. Come soon.

884
01:10:52,270 --> 01:10:53,270
Okay?

885
01:10:55,310 --> 01:10:56,020
Bye.

886
01:10:56,230 --> 01:10:57,980
Come on.
Do come soon.

887
01:10:58,100 --> 01:11:01,850
Burn the old witch off today
Tomorrow we have Holi colours to play

888
01:11:01,890 --> 01:11:05,260
It's a full moon night tonight
Call Hari, he will heal your plight

889
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:09,230
Burn the old witch off today
Tomorrow we have Holi colours to play

890
01:11:25,930 --> 01:11:29,680
You have beautiful hair,
like those actors on TV.

891
01:11:31,060 --> 01:11:32,560
Do you shampoo everyday?

892
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:33,640
Yes...

893
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:35,800
Three days in a week.

894
01:11:36,350 --> 01:11:37,600
Sit, will you?

895
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:38,640
Sit.

896
01:11:40,270 --> 01:11:42,520
I don't find the time at all.

897
01:11:42,730 --> 01:11:45,060
There's always so much
work to finish at home.

898
01:11:45,270 --> 01:11:47,900
I'm lucky if I can wash my
hair once a week.

899
01:11:48,770 --> 01:11:49,770
Hey...

900
01:11:50,350 --> 01:11:52,640
you must go to
the parlour regularly...

901
01:11:53,020 --> 01:11:54,020
Yes.

902
01:11:54,770 --> 01:11:55,900
Wow!

903
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:58,430
Can't get enough of you, can he?

904
01:12:01,850 --> 01:12:03,100
Hey... will you

905
01:12:03,230 --> 01:12:04,270
change?

906
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:07,010
No, I only wore this
today morning.

907
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:08,680
Sit.

908
01:12:09,270 --> 01:12:12,150
Thakurpo, you will be
playing at Kirtan, right?

909
01:12:13,890 --> 01:12:14,890
Right?-
- Yes.

910
01:12:14,930 --> 01:12:16,720
Won't you change?-
- I'll find something.

911
01:12:16,770 --> 01:12:19,480
Hey, please don't sit here.
I will change the sari.

912
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:20,560
Go outside.

913
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:27,390
Where are you going?

914
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:29,980
Sit here, lock the door.

915
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:51,610
Hark, Lord Krishna!

916
01:12:51,730 --> 01:12:53,560
Should I fold the sari for you?

917
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:54,680
No, thanks.

918
01:12:55,390 --> 01:12:57,850
I'll let it breathe for sometime.

919
01:13:28,890 --> 01:13:31,180
I used to be
slim like you earlier.

920
01:13:31,890 --> 01:13:34,390
I put on weight after
Gaja was born.

921
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:37,900
I work so hard. At the
school, at home...

922
01:13:39,020 --> 01:13:40,610
I wipe the floor everyday.

923
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:42,470
But I can't lose the fat.

924
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:45,810
To add to that, my husband
wants another kid now!

925
01:13:47,890 --> 01:13:51,180
As if one monkey wasn't enough,
now he wants another!

926
01:13:51,230 --> 01:13:53,310
But men will never
understand all this.

927
01:13:53,430 --> 01:13:55,260
He wants what he wants.

928
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:00,970
It was so difficult when
Gaja was to be born...

929
01:14:02,810 --> 01:14:04,400
It was summer.

930
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:07,640
And I had that huge belly!

931
01:14:07,810 --> 01:14:10,020
It was very painful!

932
01:14:17,430 --> 01:14:19,140
Hey...

933
01:14:19,270 --> 01:14:22,690
Don't attend calls during the Kirtan.
Keep it on silent mode.

934
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:30,560
Look...

935
01:14:30,930 --> 01:14:32,640
who has come to see you!

936
01:14:35,310 --> 01:14:36,980
I'll be there in a bit.

937
01:14:38,230 --> 01:14:39,650
Stop dabbling with that.

938
01:14:40,180 --> 01:14:41,600
Look, who is here!

939
01:14:43,230 --> 01:14:46,980
The school teacher will come
to take this watch by 8 pm.

940
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:50,600
Don't even have the time
to turn around once?

941
01:14:50,980 --> 01:14:52,310
Look!

942
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:54,150
Who is it now?

943
01:14:55,100 --> 01:14:57,510
See. Mother Sarada is here!

944
01:14:58,980 --> 01:15:00,900
Look, he has come first!

945
01:15:01,140 --> 01:15:03,680
By dressing up!-
- In the Go As You Like.

946
01:15:04,770 --> 01:15:06,900
Good. Very nice.

947
01:15:07,100 --> 01:15:09,390
Go to your room and
study with your sister.

948
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:13,110
And Reena, remove his
make up right away. Go.

949
01:15:13,180 --> 01:15:14,890
Come.

950
01:15:37,850 --> 01:15:39,760
The boy won a cup!

951
01:15:39,980 --> 01:15:42,190
Look how his Dad is reacting!

952
01:15:42,310 --> 01:15:44,440
You could've given him
a hug at least!

953
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:45,770
'Good. Very nice'.

954
01:15:45,890 --> 01:15:46,890
That's all?

955
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:49,730
This is the hundredth
time I'm saying this,

956
01:15:49,810 --> 01:15:51,900
don't make Parimal wear
women's clothes.

957
01:15:51,980 --> 01:15:54,610
This was a Go As You
Like competition!

958
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:57,180
Right. Why not dress up
as a boy then?

959
01:15:58,430 --> 01:16:01,470
He wanted to be Mother Sarada...-
- And you agreed?

960
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:04,770
Don't you know he's always
been fond of your cosmetics?

961
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:06,860
He likes wearing Reena's clothes!

962
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:12,480
Just a kid's fancy...

963
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:13,890
Not just a fancy.

964
01:16:14,060 --> 01:16:15,650
Are you blind? Don't you see it?

965
01:16:15,810 --> 01:16:19,190
The way he walks and talks,
everything is different. Like a girl.

966
01:16:19,270 --> 01:16:22,060
If you allow this now,
his future will be ruined later.

967
01:16:22,100 --> 01:16:24,140
Have you seen
Shibnath-da's elder son?

968
01:16:24,180 --> 01:16:26,510
People taunt him to be a girl!

969
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:29,810
The younger brother is married
but no luck with that guy.

970
01:16:30,140 --> 01:16:32,550
You're stupid so you don't get it.

971
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:36,390
One more day you put make up
on him, I will leave this house!

972
01:16:38,180 --> 01:16:40,600
All of you are blind idiots!

973
01:16:44,230 --> 01:16:48,900
My Hari is gone

974
01:16:49,140 --> 01:16:52,890
To the land of honey, Mathura

975
01:16:53,270 --> 01:16:56,980
Leaving behind our love...

976
01:16:59,310 --> 01:17:05,690
We, the family women...

977
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:13,600
I lie abandoned on the
roadside, as if

978
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:17,730
A garland used and thrown away

979
01:17:17,810 --> 01:17:25,520
My friend, I lie abandoned
on the roadside as if

980
01:17:26,230 --> 01:17:29,650
A garland used and thrown away

981
01:17:31,390 --> 01:17:33,260
You know, my dear friend

982
01:17:33,640 --> 01:17:37,510
As long as your Krishna
lived in the Vrindavan

983
01:17:38,350 --> 01:17:42,760
I had all the happiness
All the joy

984
01:17:42,980 --> 01:17:44,810
But...

985
01:17:45,480 --> 01:17:47,690
Once that our Krishna left

986
01:17:48,180 --> 01:17:51,890
My heart

987
01:17:52,140 --> 01:17:55,680
Is now bereft of all the joy

988
01:17:55,890 --> 01:18:01,930
I lie abandoned on the roadside

989
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:06,270
As if a garland used
and thrown away

990
01:18:16,930 --> 01:18:22,680
My fate is such now...

991
01:18:22,930 --> 01:18:28,680
My fate is such now...

992
01:18:28,930 --> 01:18:33,930
Like a garland thrown away

993
01:18:34,100 --> 01:18:38,680
My fate is such now...

994
01:18:49,060 --> 01:18:51,980
I don't feel like
going back home.

995
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:56,800
Again that crowded train.

996
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:02,150
The train will be empty
on the way back.

997
01:19:02,350 --> 01:19:04,430
Did you hear me?

998
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:08,190
I did.

999
01:19:09,310 --> 01:19:11,270
What did I say?

1000
01:19:13,230 --> 01:19:15,230
Vidyasagar.

1001
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:18,520
What did he do?

1002
01:19:21,060 --> 01:19:22,980
You irritate me a lot.

1003
01:19:23,810 --> 01:19:27,150
He swam through this Damodar
river on a stormy night...

1004
01:19:27,310 --> 01:19:30,400
when he heard his
mother was ill.

1005
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:33,480
Everything is possible if you
have the will power, Pari.

1006
01:19:37,730 --> 01:19:40,310
Do you have the will power?

1007
01:19:40,430 --> 01:19:44,180
Could I come here with you
on a festive day if I didn't?

1008
01:19:44,930 --> 01:19:48,510
This is just a few stations
away from home.

1009
01:19:49,430 --> 01:19:52,970
If you can, take me to America.

1010
01:19:53,430 --> 01:19:54,890
Why America?

1011
01:19:55,230 --> 01:19:59,060
Marriage between two males
is legal there, Subhash-da.

1012
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:01,520
Can you?

1013
01:20:02,140 --> 01:20:05,050
You're so good in studies!

1014
01:20:05,350 --> 01:20:07,800
You can sit for the exam!

1015
01:20:07,890 --> 01:20:09,550
You've a sure chance!

1016
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:10,760
You're crazy!

1017
01:20:11,730 --> 01:20:14,650
And then two of us can elope...

1018
01:20:18,390 --> 01:20:21,890
You said one can do it
with will power...

1019
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:29,690
Shubhash-da...

1020
01:20:35,350 --> 01:20:40,180
Whom do I ask?
What do I say?

1021
01:20:41,020 --> 01:20:46,060
My dear friend, hear me out

1022
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:54,220
How do I spend these

1023
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:59,220
Long days and nights?

1024
01:21:00,140 --> 01:21:04,390
How do I spend these

1025
01:21:04,770 --> 01:21:08,900
Long days and nights?

1026
01:21:10,020 --> 01:21:12,730
In this Vrindavan
bereft of Krishna

1027
01:21:13,060 --> 01:21:16,900
How am I to pass the
long days and nights?

1028
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:22,900
How am I to pass the
long days and nights?

1029
01:21:23,230 --> 01:21:27,980
In this Vrindavan
bereft of Krishna

1030
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:33,520
How am I to pass the
long days and nights?

1031
01:21:34,230 --> 01:21:38,980
In this Vrindavan
bereft of Krishna

1032
01:21:39,730 --> 01:21:44,770
How am I to pass the
long days and nights?

1033
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:52,270
Hark now the names
Nitai, Gaur and the beloved Hari!

1034
01:21:52,770 --> 01:21:57,650
In the name of the Hari!

1035
01:22:07,180 --> 01:22:13,930
Hark the name of the Hari
Hark the name of the Hari!

1036
01:22:14,390 --> 01:22:20,510
Hark the name of the Hari
Hark the name of the Hari!

1037
01:22:27,730 --> 01:22:35,730
Hark now the names
Nitai, Gaur and the beloved Hari!

1038
01:23:30,350 --> 01:23:32,510
You continue.

1039
01:23:32,770 --> 01:23:35,230
In summer, the river
Hardly has water

1040
01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:38,110
So the cattle can cross and...

1041
01:23:38,390 --> 01:23:41,430
What is it, Pari?

1042
01:23:42,020 --> 01:23:44,900
Are you getting married
to my sister?

1043
01:23:47,930 --> 01:23:49,220
Yes.

1044
01:23:50,850 --> 01:23:53,850
Your father suddenly proposed...

1045
01:23:54,930 --> 01:23:57,470
And what about me?

1046
01:23:58,980 --> 01:24:01,060
You're a disgusting man!

1047
01:24:01,180 --> 01:24:02,600
Pari.

1048
01:24:06,350 --> 01:24:07,800
Pari...

1049
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:17,980
Thank you.

1050
01:24:21,480 --> 01:24:22,940
Pari!

1051
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:06,220
Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare

1052

Krishna Krishna Hare Hare

1056
01:25:26,100 --> 01:25:30,550
Parimal, will you dress up
your own bride too?

1057
01:25:34,730 --> 01:25:37,730
There's this young boy who
gives my daughter tuitions.

1058
01:25:37,810 --> 01:25:39,770
I'll get rid of him!

1059
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:45,810
What did Subhash come to teach?
And what did he end up teaching?

1060
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:51,760
Pari, have you paid
Subhash this month's salary?

1061
01:26:01,640 --> 01:26:03,300
Please don't be sad...

1062
01:26:07,480 --> 01:26:09,810
The groom is here!
Let's go!

1063
01:26:55,480 --> 01:26:57,940
♪ Madhu-da Calling ♪

1064
01:26:59,140 --> 01:27:00,640
Hello.

1065
01:27:00,890 --> 01:27:02,970
Where are you, Puti?
I am at the riverside.

1066
01:27:03,100 --> 01:27:04,470
How did your hair open?

1067
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:06,900
Anyway, forget it. We
had to tell someday!

1068
01:27:07,060 --> 01:27:09,400
You can't live a
fake life forever!

1069
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:11,510
No big deal! Just come back!

1070
01:27:11,770 --> 01:27:15,360
It's not your fault that you've
a man's body! It's God's mistake!

1071
01:27:15,680 --> 01:27:18,970
How can a person have a different
heart and a different body?

1072
01:27:19,060 --> 01:27:21,730
They've to understand this!
Eunuchs too are people, like us!

1073
01:27:21,810 --> 01:27:24,650
It's no issue, just come! Besides,
you'll change the entire body!

1074
01:27:25,430 --> 01:27:27,510
Only then we'll come back!

1075
01:27:27,810 --> 01:27:30,610
If they still don't accept,
I don't need this family!

1076
01:27:30,980 --> 01:27:33,980
Please come back! Nothing is
wrong! Just come, please!

1077
01:27:37,850 --> 01:27:39,390
Thakurpo...

1078
01:31:12,180 --> 01:31:13,930
Listen.

1079
01:31:14,390 --> 01:31:16,300
This time that you leave,

1080
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:20,550
kindly do not step into
this house again.

1081
01:31:28,730 --> 01:31:29,730
And...

1082
01:31:32,140 --> 01:31:34,760
In so many years, not
one person could...

1083
01:31:34,810 --> 01:31:37,810
point their finger at this
family of Kirtan singers.

1084
01:31:39,890 --> 01:31:42,180
You've assured that
it happens now.

1085
01:31:42,680 --> 01:31:45,050
Didn't you feel ashamed
for once?

1086
01:31:45,730 --> 01:31:47,610
Just get out.

1087
01:31:47,980 --> 01:31:49,270
Get out!

1088
01:32:25,270 --> 01:32:26,980
Thakurpo...

1089
01:32:43,680 --> 01:32:45,510
Her mobile phone.

1090
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:50,730
And this.

1091
01:32:51,230 --> 01:32:53,110
Did you find her?

1092
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:55,650
No.

1093
01:32:57,430 --> 01:32:58,850
Go.

1094
01:32:59,180 --> 01:33:00,760
And, listen...

1095
01:33:05,770 --> 01:33:07,310
Keep this.

1096
01:33:07,890 --> 01:33:09,350
There's 2000 bucks.

1097
01:33:10,350 --> 01:33:12,350
I don't have anymore.

1098
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:15,930
Go.

1099
01:33:20,930 --> 01:33:22,600
Listen...

1100
01:33:26,230 --> 01:33:28,150
Please call me!

1101
01:33:46,430 --> 01:33:49,600
How can you refuse colours
on a Holi day?

1102
01:33:50,140 --> 01:33:53,350
Come out, everyone!
Don't be scared of colours!

1103
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:56,310
Holi is here!

1104
01:33:56,520 --> 01:33:59,690
Be generous today! For
some meat and rice today!

1105
01:33:59,850 --> 01:34:02,550
As if you can't afford meat
without my money?

1106
01:34:03,230 --> 01:34:04,230
Wait.

1107
01:34:04,770 --> 01:34:05,770
Here...

1108
01:34:05,850 --> 01:34:07,640
Let's go.-
- We can't afford the potatoes but.

1109
01:34:07,680 --> 01:34:10,050
Pay us for some potatoes then!?

1110
01:34:10,730 --> 01:34:13,610
Be gone now!-
- May God bless you and your business!

1111
01:34:13,680 --> 01:34:14,890
Babli, take it.

1112
01:34:15,020 --> 01:34:17,900
How can you refuse colours
on a Holi day?

1113
01:34:18,640 --> 01:34:21,350
Come out, everyone!
Don't be scared of colours!

1114
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:24,560
We've got the potatoes!
Now give us some tomatoes!

1115
01:34:26,810 --> 01:34:29,230
Why are you guys laughing?-
- Please pay!

1116
01:34:29,810 --> 01:34:31,860
How many times should I pay?

1117
01:34:31,890 --> 01:34:35,680
We'll get only seeds in 50
bucks. Please pay another 20!

1118
01:34:35,770 --> 01:34:40,230
But I did give another one of you
a fifty. Now go. No business today.

1119
01:34:40,350 --> 01:34:43,350
Why are you lying? We just
came. Who collected from you?

1120
01:34:43,480 --> 01:34:46,150
Another one.-
- Anyway, let's go.

1121
01:34:46,230 --> 01:34:51,060
How can you refuse colours
on a Holi day?

1122
01:34:51,180 --> 01:34:54,140
Come out, everyone!
Don't be scared of colours!

1123
01:34:54,890 --> 01:34:57,100
May God bless you!

1124
01:34:58,180 --> 01:35:01,180
Put your head forward,
I'll put some colour!

1125
01:35:01,270 --> 01:35:05,690
Now you're putting colour on
it, soon you'll cut my head off!

1126
01:35:05,770 --> 01:35:07,480
If you insist dear...

1127
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:10,140
then put some colour. Go ahead.

1128
01:35:10,810 --> 01:35:14,150
Pay anything you like.
It's a festive day...

1129
01:35:14,310 --> 01:35:17,980
The business is very sad.
Hardly any customers. Take.

1130
01:35:19,310 --> 01:35:20,400
But...

1131
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:21,900
A little while ago...

1132
01:35:21,980 --> 01:35:25,400
another one from your clan
came to collect money.

1133
01:35:25,430 --> 01:35:30,680
If you keep coming back so many
times a day, I've to close my shop!

1134
01:35:30,770 --> 01:35:34,020
We don't have another else here.-
- What!

1135
01:35:34,180 --> 01:35:36,640
She was a young one...

1136
01:35:37,100 --> 01:35:40,180
She clapped and took
30 bucks from me.

1137
01:35:40,270 --> 01:35:42,520
Where did she go?-
- That way.

1138
01:35:42,640 --> 01:35:44,640
Go, check.-
- Where did she go?

1139
01:35:44,770 --> 01:35:48,190
Take your money, Grandpa.
Why must you pay twice?

1140
01:35:48,350 --> 01:35:49,760
Neha...-
- Yes, Guru-ma?

1141
01:35:49,850 --> 01:35:51,510
Give back the money
we collected.

1142
01:35:51,640 --> 01:35:53,180
Come with me!

1143
01:36:05,890 --> 01:36:09,100
How can you refuse colours
on a Holi day?

1144
01:36:09,310 --> 01:36:12,520
How can you refuse colours
on a Holi day?

1145
01:36:13,100 --> 01:36:17,640
Come out, everyone!
Don't be scared of colours!

1146
01:36:18,810 --> 01:36:20,900
What's your name?

1147
01:36:21,640 --> 01:36:23,930
Puti.-
- Speak up! Louder!

1148
01:36:24,100 --> 01:36:26,430
Were you collecting
money from the market?

1149
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:29,400
I lost my bag. I was
very hungry, so...

1150
01:36:29,560 --> 01:36:30,940
You liar!

1151
01:36:31,430 --> 01:36:33,180
Who is your Guru? Speak up!

1152
01:36:33,560 --> 01:36:34,560
Come on!

1153
01:36:35,140 --> 01:36:36,390
From Kolkata... Arati.

1154
01:36:36,430 --> 01:36:38,800
Show me your license!
Where are the papers?

1155
01:36:38,930 --> 01:36:41,600
You've come from Kolkata
to Nabadwip to collect money?

1156
01:36:41,680 --> 01:36:43,760
Give us your Guru's
phone number!

1157
01:36:44,430 --> 01:36:46,050
I don't have a phone...-
- One tight slap!

1158
01:36:46,100 --> 01:36:49,100
Stop it!-
- Move away from my shop!

1159
01:36:49,310 --> 01:36:51,770
Go to that side.-
- Fine, we will go!

1160
01:36:52,020 --> 01:36:54,480
Trust me, I lost my phone!-
- Let's get this fellow!

1161
01:36:54,680 --> 01:36:57,640
Come on! Let's take this one there!

1162
01:36:57,730 --> 01:36:59,940
Come with us!

1163
01:37:00,680 --> 01:37:03,680
Give us your phone number!-
- What are you doing here?

1164
01:37:03,770 --> 01:37:07,610
How much money have you
collected? Take it out!

1165
01:37:07,850 --> 01:37:10,600
One good shelling and
you'll be fine!

1166
01:37:10,770 --> 01:37:13,900
Faking it as a eunuch, eh?
Come on, take out the money!

1167
01:37:14,140 --> 01:37:17,140
Give us the money!-
- This is all I have...

1168
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:20,980
Please let me go! I collected
money to go home!

1169
01:37:21,140 --> 01:37:22,850
Take all of this!

1170
01:37:45,100 --> 01:37:47,550
Mala, pass the stool.

1171
01:37:52,890 --> 01:37:54,390
Sit.

1172
01:38:00,060 --> 01:38:02,190
What's your name?

1173
01:38:03,100 --> 01:38:04,510
Parimal.

1174
01:38:04,930 --> 01:38:06,010
Pari (angel).

1175
01:38:06,100 --> 01:38:09,140
Is that so?
A fallen angel it seems.

1176
01:38:10,520 --> 01:38:12,150
Who sent you here?

1177
01:38:12,930 --> 01:38:16,050
They aren't sent by
anyone. They just come.

1178
01:38:16,100 --> 01:38:18,100
They come on their own.

1179
01:38:18,640 --> 01:38:21,220
The Bargabhima temple
in Tamluk district...

1180
01:38:21,810 --> 01:38:23,730
There's a well in there.

1181
01:38:24,390 --> 01:38:28,640
Everyday a Sole fish
enters that well.

1182
01:38:29,810 --> 01:38:31,730
Where it comes from...

1183
01:38:31,850 --> 01:38:32,850
And when?

1184
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:35,190
There's no answer to that.

1185
01:38:35,680 --> 01:38:36,930
But it comes.

1186
01:38:37,480 --> 01:38:39,730
At the temple, they sacrifice...

1187
01:38:39,980 --> 01:38:41,940
that Sole fish everyday.

1188
01:38:42,140 --> 01:38:43,800
Not one day goes amiss.

1189
01:38:43,930 --> 01:38:45,350
That's how our fallen angel...

1190
01:38:45,430 --> 01:38:47,550
Pari... has arrived here.

1191
01:38:58,890 --> 01:39:00,470
Know how to dance?

1192
01:39:02,730 --> 01:39:03,980
Sandhya...

1193
01:39:04,270 --> 01:39:06,270
Take her inside.

1194
01:39:06,430 --> 01:39:08,390
Change her clothes and
bring her.

1195
01:39:08,810 --> 01:39:10,980
Go with Didi (sister).

1196
01:39:11,850 --> 01:39:13,100
Come.

1197
01:39:14,640 --> 01:39:16,050
Listen...-
- Yes?

1198
01:39:16,600 --> 01:39:19,260
Check if it gets hard.

1199
01:39:21,390 --> 01:39:22,680
And listen,

1200
01:39:24,020 --> 01:39:27,190
will you be able to stay here?

1201
01:39:28,810 --> 01:39:31,860
Once the Sole fish enters the well...

1202
01:39:32,060 --> 01:39:34,810
it can't go back to the river.

1203
01:39:34,930 --> 01:39:37,350
Will you remember that?

1204
01:39:38,310 --> 01:39:39,310
Go.

1205
01:39:59,640 --> 01:40:01,930
Have you seen this girl here?

1206
01:40:02,770 --> 01:40:04,190
Have you seen her?

1207
01:40:04,640 --> 01:40:07,010
The clouds have dispersed

1208
01:40:12,930 --> 01:40:14,970
It is a holiday today, brother!

1209
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:17,480
So we are set free

1210
01:40:18,180 --> 01:40:20,260
It is a holiday today, brother!

1211
01:40:20,730 --> 01:40:22,770
So we are set free

1212
01:40:28,770 --> 01:40:29,940
Stop!

1213
01:40:31,100 --> 01:40:35,010
A eunuch dancing to Tagore's song?

1214
01:40:37,480 --> 01:40:45,230
Hark, the name of Lord Rama

1215
01:40:45,430 --> 01:40:51,510
Hark, the name of Lord Krishna

1216
01:40:52,060 --> 01:40:52,980
Brother...

1217
01:40:53,020 --> 01:40:55,980
Have you seen this girl anywhere?-
- Ask over there.

1218
01:40:56,270 --> 01:40:58,360
They will know.

1219
01:41:03,560 --> 01:41:05,360
Have you seen this girl?

1220
01:41:05,390 --> 01:41:07,600
No. Ask someone else.

1221
01:41:11,640 --> 01:41:14,430
Brother, have you seen this girl?

1222
01:41:14,850 --> 01:41:16,260
No...

1223
01:41:23,850 --> 01:41:26,430
Who can fathom the game of love?

1224
01:41:27,480 --> 01:41:29,810
Who can fathom the game of love?

1225
01:41:30,100 --> 01:41:31,010
My dear love

1226
01:41:31,060 --> 01:41:33,480
Who can fathom the game of love?

1227
01:41:33,850 --> 01:41:34,930
Come, dance...

1228
01:41:35,140 --> 01:41:38,720
Only the one who is bit by love
Knows what it is

1229
01:41:38,930 --> 01:41:42,510
Only the one who is bit by love
Knows what it is

1230
01:41:42,810 --> 01:41:45,770
Who can fathom the game of love?

1231
01:41:46,640 --> 01:41:47,640
My dear love

1232
01:41:47,730 --> 01:41:50,230
Who can fathom the game of love?

1233
01:41:51,230 --> 01:41:55,020
Love isn't planned, my friend
It just happens

1234
01:41:55,480 --> 01:41:58,400
The heartbeats run fast
Full of deep sighs

1235
01:41:59,060 --> 01:42:02,730
Love isn't planned, my friend
It just happens

1236
01:42:02,850 --> 01:42:05,800
The heartbeats run fast
Full of deep sighs

1237
01:42:06,100 --> 01:42:09,600
The heart breaks
But you remain silent

1238
01:42:27,350 --> 01:42:29,640
Have you seen this girl?

1239
01:42:31,850 --> 01:42:33,680
The eunuch?

1240
01:42:35,310 --> 01:42:38,810
She was begging in
the wrong area...

1241
01:42:39,430 --> 01:42:41,300
The local eunuchs...

1242
01:42:41,350 --> 01:42:42,550
They found out.

1243
01:42:43,140 --> 01:42:44,760
They picked her up!

1244
01:42:45,390 --> 01:42:48,510
You've no idea how much
they beat her! Just an hour ago...

1245
01:42:48,600 --> 01:42:51,180
She wasn't really a eunuch.
He was a man!

1246
01:42:51,810 --> 01:42:54,610
He dressed up as a
eunuch to collect money!

1247
01:42:54,680 --> 01:42:57,300
That's it! I've made a
video of that!

1248
01:42:59,020 --> 01:43:01,270
See... do you know him?

1249
01:43:01,850 --> 01:43:04,470
Thank God the police saved him.

1250
01:43:04,640 --> 01:43:07,050
They would've killed him!
Here, look...

1251
01:43:07,310 --> 01:43:10,190
Please believe me, I

I swear, I didn't do anything!

1260
01:43:39,350 --> 01:43:42,550
Hit him! We should just kill him!

1261
01:43:42,680 --> 01:43:45,100
Please leave me!

1262
01:43:45,270 --> 01:43:46,810
Yes, put the colour on him!

1263
01:43:46,930 --> 01:43:48,850
Put the colour!

1264
01:43:50,350 --> 01:43:53,300
Please... please let me go!

1265
01:44:06,890 --> 01:44:09,680
Say it! Say, that you're a man!

01:44:09,770 --> 01:44:12,310
I am a man!-
- Yes, say it!

1267
01:44:12,980 --> 01:44:18,150
Say it on camera, that you defamed
us eunuchs my faking to be one!

1268
01:44:18,230 --> 01:44:19,560
I dressed up as a eunuch...

1269
01:44:19,730 --> 01:44:23,110
Say it loudly! Say that
you won't ever do this again!

1270
01:44:23,390 --> 01:44:26,550
Say it loudly! And hit him!

1271
01:44:26,640 --> 01:44:28,680
Hit him harder!
People should know!

1272
01:44:28,770 --> 01:44:32,310
Everybody, make a video of this!
Put it up on Facebook for everyone!

1273
01:44:38,980 --> 01:44:41,020
What happened?

1274
01:44:47,480 --> 01:44:49,440
My Guru-ma is Sutapa.

01:44:49,600 --> 01:44:51,800
She is from South 24
Parganas district.

1276
01:44:51,890 --> 01:44:53,640
I am her disciple.

1277
01:44:53,730 --> 01:44:55,810
I am Arati, from Kolkata district.

1278
01:44:56,810 --> 01:44:58,980
I am making Pari my disciple.

1279

From Howrah district.

1280
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:03,440
Do you give consent?-

1281
01:45:05,310 --> 01:45:07,060
Take a bite.

1282

Have a good life.

1283
01:45:19,980 --> 01:45:21,150
Okay...

1284
01:45:22,640 --> 01:45:24,300
How do you know her?

1285
01:45:25,350 --> 01:45:27,010
She's my girlfriend.

1286
01:45:28,930 --> 01:45:31,470
Where did you see a girl in him?

1287
01:45:32,390 --> 01:45:36,930
Why find a 'Chhakka' when there
are so many pretty girls in the world?

1288
01:45:37,020 --> 01:45:38,400
Okay, I get it.

1289
01:45:39,390 --> 01:45:42,050
Must have deceived
you as a girl.

1290
01:45:43,020 --> 01:45:45,150
These people usually
have a gang.

1291
01:45:45,890 --> 01:45:47,390
They steal, they rob.

1292
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:50,600
You can't catch them how
they dress up as eunuchs.

1293
01:45:50,680 --> 01:45:52,260
They peddle drugs too.

1294
01:45:52,430 --> 01:45:53,850
Where are you from?

1295
01:45:53,890 --> 01:45:55,180
Nabadwip.

1296
01:45:55,730 --> 01:45:56,980
Is that so?

1297
01:45:57,100 --> 01:45:59,140
How could you get into all this?

1298
01:45:59,310 --> 01:46:02,150
You're wearing a Tulsi garland!
A pure Vaishnava boy!

1299
01:46:02,180 --> 01:46:04,760
Why try the non-vegetarian stuff?

1300
01:46:04,810 --> 01:46:06,060
Where is she now?

1301
01:46:06,100 --> 01:46:07,350
Here.

1302
01:46:08,310 --> 01:46:09,480
Picked him up.

1303
01:46:09,890 --> 01:46:13,930
They were beating him up! They'd
kill him if we didn't intervene.

1304
01:46:14,020 --> 01:46:16,400
Locked him up in that
room at the corner.

1305
01:46:17,770 --> 01:46:18,770
Manoj...-
- Sir?

1306
01:46:19,310 --> 01:46:21,440
Get the boy.-
- Yes, Sir.

1307
01:46:26,850 --> 01:46:27,850
You see...

1308
01:46:29,060 --> 01:46:33,060
the government has made
jail-rooms for men and women.

1309
01:46:33,270 --> 01:46:36,310
But there are no jail-rooms
for the third gender.

1310
01:46:38,640 --> 01:46:40,100
Where's this chap from?

1311
01:46:40,310 --> 01:46:42,310
From Nabadwip too?

1312
01:46:42,480 --> 01:46:43,480
Kolkata.

1313
01:46:43,560 --> 01:46:45,310
There you go! I knew it!

1314
01:46:45,850 --> 01:46:48,300
Rascal's from the city!
Listen to me.

1315
01:46:48,680 --> 01:46:50,640
Talk to him, send him home.

1316
01:46:50,810 --> 01:46:53,060
Or you must get out of here.

1317
01:46:53,140 --> 01:46:55,510
Why get involved in
such a grave case?

1318
01:46:55,850 --> 01:46:56,890
Right?

1319
01:46:57,640 --> 01:46:58,850
Take my advice.

1320
01:46:58,930 --> 01:47:00,510
Sir, please come fast!

1321
01:47:00,640 --> 01:47:03,140
What happened?-
- Please come fast, Sir!

1322
01:47:08,310 --> 01:47:10,560
This bugger...

1323
01:47:16,980 --> 01:47:18,940
What the hell!!

1324
01:47:48,810 --> 01:47:51,400
Bitch...

1325
01:48:42,270 --> 01:48:46,520
It is a holiday today, brother!

1326
01:48:47,640 --> 01:48:51,640
So we are set free

She is from Birbhum district.

1332
01:49:10,640 --> 01:49:13,680
