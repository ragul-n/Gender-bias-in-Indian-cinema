~ The Extraordinary Journey of the Fakir (2018) ~

2
00:00:23,584 --> 00:00:24,834
<i>A long, long time ago,</i>

3
00:00:25,001 --> 00:00:28,834
<i>Someone declared that
all men were born free and equal.</i>

4
00:00:29,126 --> 00:00:30,834
<i>And that means all men.</i>

5
00:00:31,126 --> 00:00:33,167
<i>And that means all women.</i>

6
00:00:33,417 --> 00:00:34,751
<i>Everyone equal.</i>

7
00:00:35,292 --> 00:00:38,167
<i>That would be one set of rules
for everyone.</i>

8
00:00:38,292 --> 00:00:39,917
<i>A level playing field.</i>

9
00:00:40,084 --> 00:00:42,292
<i>Life would be fair.</i>

10
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:44,042
<i>But even if that were true,</i>

11
00:00:44,167 --> 00:00:46,792
<i>one micro-second after we are born,</i>

12
00:00:46,917 --> 00:00:48,792
<i>chance steps in.</i>

13
00:00:49,792 --> 00:00:51,167
<i>Who your parents are,</i>

14
00:00:51,292 --> 00:00:52,109
<i>your neighborhood,</i>

15
00:00:52,134 --> 00:00:53,834
<i>the family's net income,</i>

16
00:00:54,126 --> 00:00:55,042
<i>your health,</i>

17
00:00:55,167 --> 00:00:56,084
<i>your size,</i>

18
00:00:56,251 --> 00:00:57,459
<i>your looks.</i>

19
00:00:58,084 --> 00:01:01,751
<i>Once the tyranny of chance
starts laying down the law,</i>

20
00:01:01,876 --> 00:01:04,792
<i>there is no more level playing field.</i>

21
00:01:04,917 --> 00:01:06,626
<i>Chance is everything.</i>

22
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:09,009
<i>Ultimately,</i>

23
00:01:09,034 --> 00:01:11,834
<i>we play with the hand it deals us.</i>

24
00:01:12,584 --> 00:01:15,417
"The Extraordinary Journey of the Fakir"

25
00:01:15,792 --> 00:01:20,459
<i>This is the story of
Ajatashatru Lavash Patel.</i>

26
00:01:20,542 --> 00:01:22,001
<i>And these are the cards</i>

27
00:01:22,126 --> 00:01:24,251
<i>chance dealt him.</i>

28
00:01:32,251 --> 00:01:33,876
Judge Mowani is a bastard.

29
00:01:34,042 --> 00:01:36,501
He's a scum!
A dirty thief!

30
00:01:36,584 --> 00:01:38,167
You all are idiots!

31
00:01:38,542 --> 00:01:42,001
Who the hell are you?
What do you want?

32
00:01:42,292 --> 00:01:44,376
Dirty bag!
You bastard!

33
00:01:44,501 --> 00:01:47,251
Garbage, scum!

34
00:01:47,376 --> 00:01:48,334
Get out!

35
00:01:48,917 --> 00:01:51,084
Are you here to
beat the shit out of us?

36
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,000
No.

37
00:01:52,084 --> 00:01:55,042
- That's what the other said that.
- And then, he beat all of us!

38
00:01:56,209 --> 00:01:57,792
I'm here to tell a story.

39
00:01:57,917 --> 00:01:58,626
A story?

40
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,400
Yes.

41
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:01,459
What kind of a story?

42
00:02:02,167 --> 00:02:03,042
A tragedy.

43
00:02:03,082 --> 00:02:04,082
A tragedy?

44
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:07,126
I think I prefer the beating.

45
00:02:09,501 --> 00:02:13,126
Judge Mowani just sentenced you to
four years in juvenile prison.

46
00:02:13,792 --> 00:02:16,084
I think you have time for a story.

47
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:17,084
May I?

48
00:02:22,917 --> 00:02:24,542
I was born in Bombay,

49
00:02:24,834 --> 00:02:27,126
in the small, small area of Worli.

50
00:02:27,376 --> 00:02:28,709
When I was young,

51
00:02:29,876 --> 00:02:32,417
I knew nothing about
the rest of the world.

52
00:02:33,251 --> 00:02:34,209
Nothing.

53
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:37,626
Siringh, why are the
San Continental sheets not ready?

54
00:02:37,751 --> 00:02:39,792
You really need to be quicker on this!

55
00:02:39,917 --> 00:02:44,109
<i>I am the only son of a wonderful, loving,
very very hardworking woman,</i>

56
00:02:44,234 --> 00:02:46,109
<i>named Siringh Lavash Patel.</i>

57
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:49,376
Four more loads have arrived!

58
00:02:49,501 --> 00:02:50,667
You have to stay late tonight!

59
00:02:51,336 --> 00:02:52,836
Siringh, bring out the two loads...

60
00:02:53,501 --> 00:02:55,709
Aja, you have to keep out of trouble.

61
00:02:55,834 --> 00:02:57,209
You can't keep doing this!

62
00:02:57,334 --> 00:02:59,417
You can't keep getting
into trouble like this.

63
00:02:59,501 --> 00:03:00,609
They will take you away.

64
00:03:00,634 --> 00:03:03,584
I am a single mother. Do you
understand what I'm saying?

65
00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:05,459
They will take you away from me.

66
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,470
You can't keep getting into trouble
like this with your cousins.

67
00:03:09,478 --> 00:03:10,478
You'll have to stop it.

68
00:03:12,001 --> 00:03:13,751
If they send you to jail,

69
00:03:13,876 --> 00:03:16,001
I will not go get you.

70
00:03:16,917 --> 00:03:18,626
I will not!

71
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:25,376
Eat.

72
00:03:31,376 --> 00:03:32,584
You are too skinny.

73
00:03:34,667 --> 00:03:35,792
You have to be strong

74
00:03:35,917 --> 00:03:39,292
if you want me to take you
with me to Paris one day.

75
00:03:41,126 --> 00:03:42,084
Eat.

76
00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:43,584
Eat!

77
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:47,126
Come on, eat. You're too skinny.
Eat, Moohini.

78
00:03:47,251 --> 00:03:48,209
Eat!

79
00:03:50,917 --> 00:03:52,501
<i>When I was very young,</i>

80
00:03:52,626 --> 00:03:55,501
<i>my mother also deny the fact that
I ever have a father.</i>

81
00:03:55,626 --> 00:03:58,501
<i>She claimed I'm some kind of miracle,</i>

82
00:03:58,584 --> 00:04:00,834
<i>some kind of magic.</i>

83
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,700
Thank you very much,
and you have...

84
00:04:02,834 --> 00:04:03,626
<i>Obviously,</i>

85
00:04:03,951 --> 00:04:05,026
<i>I didn't believe her.</i>

86
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:06,690
Tomorrow mangoes for you.

87
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Okay,
I'll come and get it tomorrow.

88
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:13,251
Mama, is that him?

89
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,300
No.

90
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,360
Siringh,

91
00:04:15,417 --> 00:04:18,584
I need the Maharaja Hotel
and Grand Presidency sheets.

92
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:20,501
Now! Quick!

93
00:04:20,626 --> 00:04:22,376
Why is it always so long?

94
00:04:22,542 --> 00:04:23,501
Hurry!

95
00:04:25,501 --> 00:04:26,417
Mama,

96
00:04:27,251 --> 00:04:28,334
is that him?

97
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:29,900
No!

98
00:04:33,042 --> 00:04:33,917
Is that him?

99
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,100
No!

100
00:04:35,292 --> 00:04:36,334
No, he is not!

101
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:39,334
Stop asking. You cannot ask me
this question again and again!

102
00:04:39,792 --> 00:04:42,084
You do not have a father.

103
00:04:56,376 --> 00:04:57,709
So handsome.

104
00:04:59,167 --> 00:05:00,834
My little man.

105
00:05:01,808 --> 00:05:04,026
Now, let's repeat the continents.

106
00:05:04,029 --> 00:05:05,919
The continents are Europe...

107
00:05:06,084 --> 00:05:08,709
<i>Before school, my world was
very very small.</i>

108
00:05:08,834 --> 00:05:11,167
<i>We had no TV and no Internet.</i>

109
00:05:11,292 --> 00:05:12,259
<i>My whole world stretch</i>

110
00:05:12,342 --> 00:05:15,751
<i>from my cousin Bhatuk's house to
my cousin Bheem's home.</i>

111
00:05:15,876 --> 00:05:18,042
<i>Nothing else existed for me.</i>

112
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:24,250
<i>So as I learn about the
rest of the world,</i>

113
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:27,200
<i>one of the most mind blowing
thing I discovered was that...</i>

114
00:05:27,209 --> 00:05:28,417
Mama!

115
00:05:28,501 --> 00:05:29,292
<i>I was poor.</i>

116
00:05:29,417 --> 00:05:30,376
Are we poor?

117
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:33,084
- No.
- We are!

118
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,792
How can you say we are not poor?

119
00:05:36,917 --> 00:05:39,792
I went to school now.
I know things.

120
00:05:39,917 --> 00:05:41,209
We are very very poor.

121
00:05:41,334 --> 00:05:43,626
We are rich because
we have one another.

122
00:05:45,126 --> 00:05:46,584
But that does not make us rich.

123
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
We're going to need to do
some more test. This is very serious.

124
00:05:56,042 --> 00:05:56,876
I'm sorry...

125
00:05:59,251 --> 00:06:00,542
I understand.

126
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:08,251
<i>And one day,</i>

127
00:06:08,542 --> 00:06:10,167
<i>at the doctor's office,</i>

128
00:06:10,292 --> 00:06:12,834
<i>I made an extraordinary discovery.</i>

129
00:06:13,376 --> 00:06:14,709
That's a nothing.

130
00:06:14,834 --> 00:06:16,667
But the color is different.

131
00:06:16,792 --> 00:06:18,542
- This one is the best.
- Wow.

132
00:06:18,667 --> 00:06:21,292
And all the furniture are very good name.

133
00:06:21,417 --> 00:06:23,751
Just like Vinterdimma collection,

134
00:06:23,876 --> 00:06:25,792
or the Rostig Lördag collection,

135
00:06:25,917 --> 00:06:27,709
or the Bergman Bögart collection.

136
00:06:29,251 --> 00:06:31,376
When I become very, very rich,

137
00:06:31,501 --> 00:06:33,834
my bedroom will be the Borgshot collection.

138
00:06:34,042 --> 00:06:37,501
Moohini, in the living room,
we could have Scötken coffee table.

139
00:06:37,626 --> 00:06:39,876
My favorite collection is...

140
00:06:40,126 --> 00:06:41,792
the Djup Sömn collection,

141
00:06:42,292 --> 00:06:44,209
Trädtoppar's special edition.

142
00:06:47,167 --> 00:06:50,292
The Khoobsurut collection,
designed by Ajatashatru.

143
00:06:54,584 --> 00:06:58,459
The Sundaryat collection, designed
by the famous Ajatashatru.

144
00:06:58,542 --> 00:07:00,542
And the Taranchalah Collection,

145
00:07:01,334 --> 00:07:04,326
designed by the
extraordinary Ajatashatru.

146
00:07:04,342 --> 00:07:07,117
Aja, stop doing that.

147
00:07:07,501 --> 00:07:09,501
- Was that my father?
- No.

148
00:07:09,542 --> 00:07:12,459
<i>That year, two
things became clear.</i>

149
00:07:12,542 --> 00:07:14,876
<i>One: I was poor.</i>

150
00:07:15,042 --> 00:07:17,834
<i>And two: I no longer wanted to be poor.</i>

151
00:07:19,667 --> 00:07:21,042
Excuse me.

152
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,292
Faster!

153
00:07:40,709 --> 00:07:41,459
Here.

154
00:07:42,834 --> 00:07:44,042
Hurry!

155
00:07:45,084 --> 00:07:46,126
Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go!

156
00:07:46,334 --> 00:07:47,626
This is very heavy.

157
00:07:47,751 --> 00:07:48,667
Come, come!

158
00:07:48,792 --> 00:07:51,751
And see the famous Aja!

159
00:08:18,876 --> 00:08:20,501
<i>So, through the years,</i>

160
00:08:20,626 --> 00:08:23,459
<i>we did all sorts of magic.</i>

161
00:08:24,667 --> 00:08:27,001
Magic show,
magic show!

162
00:08:27,792 --> 00:08:28,834
<i>Levitation.</i>

163
00:08:31,467 --> 00:08:32,875
Your chance to watch the incredible...

164
00:08:32,877 --> 00:08:35,077
- <i>Illusion</i>
- ...incredible, extraordinary, Aja!

165
00:08:36,459 --> 00:08:38,084
<i>Psychic surgery.</i>

166
00:08:40,459 --> 00:08:41,209
Hello my friends,

167
00:08:41,334 --> 00:08:42,734
is this your first
time in India?

168
00:08:43,053 --> 00:08:44,253
- Yes.
- Alright.

169
00:08:44,751 --> 00:08:45,967
Is this your first time in India?

170
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:46,784
- Yes.
- Nice.

171
00:08:47,487 --> 00:08:48,687
- Is this your first time in India?
- Yeah.

172
00:08:56,792 --> 00:09:01,417
<i>More and more, the magic show was
just a minor part of our activities.</i>

173
00:09:05,501 --> 00:09:07,526
- Is this all we have made?
- Yes.

174
00:09:08,792 --> 00:09:11,126
Next time, 40%.

175
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:12,459
Not 40%!

176
00:09:15,042 --> 00:09:16,876
This is my neighborhood.

177
00:09:18,876 --> 00:09:19,626
<i>Hi.</i>

178
00:09:20,042 --> 00:09:24,042
<i>Sorry I'm late, I guess I was
stuck at work by a big dinosaur...</i>

179
00:09:24,584 --> 00:09:28,667
Mom, I want you to eat, the
doctor says you must eat.

180
00:09:29,709 --> 00:09:30,417
Aja...

181
00:09:31,751 --> 00:09:35,501
Mom, you have to be strong for
me to take you to Paris.

182
00:09:36,084 --> 00:09:38,584
We have no money to go to Paris.

183
00:09:40,042 --> 00:09:42,626
Mom,
I'm taking you to Paris.

184
00:09:43,001 --> 00:09:44,709
Who will take care of Moohini?

185
00:09:45,292 --> 00:09:48,709
Mom, Moohini is blessed, you're not
supposed to take care of her.

186
00:09:48,834 --> 00:09:50,792
She's supposed to take care of you.

187
00:09:50,917 --> 00:09:52,417
We're going to Paris, mom.

188
00:09:52,501 --> 00:09:54,251
Tonight, you are eating.

189
00:09:54,501 --> 00:09:56,376
Yes, Aja.

190
00:09:57,134 --> 00:10:00,334
<i>Then, before we could go to Paris,</i>

191
00:10:01,042 --> 00:10:02,917
<i>the bad news came.</i>

192
00:10:03,501 --> 00:10:05,084
What's wrong, Moohini?

193
00:10:10,792 --> 00:10:11,592
<i>Her heart...</i>

194
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:12,700
Mom!

195
00:10:13,251 --> 00:10:14,542
...just stopped beating.

196
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:19,209
So,
she never got to go to Paris?

197
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,300
No.

198
00:10:22,792 --> 00:10:25,251
Chance did not help me out
with that promise.

199
00:11:19,001 --> 00:11:22,376
<i>My father's name was Pierre-André Martin.</i>

200
00:11:22,392 --> 00:11:24,767
<i>He was French, from Paris.</i>

201
00:11:25,934 --> 00:11:28,059
<i>He was a street performer,
like me.</i>

202
00:11:30,376 --> 00:11:34,084
<i>My father wrote my mother
hundreds of beautiful love letters.</i>

203
00:11:34,209 --> 00:11:35,584
<i>One of his letter said that</i>

204
00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:39,084
<i>if my mother's parents
ever agree to let her to marry him,</i>

205
00:11:39,209 --> 00:11:42,501
<i>she should come to Paris,
and go to the top of the Eiffel Tower.</i>

206
00:11:44,042 --> 00:11:46,876
<i>Every Sunday,
he would wait for her.</i>

207
00:11:47,059 --> 00:11:48,351
<i>If he wasn't there,</i>

208
00:11:48,876 --> 00:11:51,501
<i>she was to fold the letter
into a airplane</i>

209
00:11:51,584 --> 00:11:53,751
<i>and throw it towards the city.</i>

210
00:11:54,209 --> 00:11:56,459
<i>It would magically take her to him.</i>

211
00:12:04,251 --> 00:12:06,751
<i>I borrowed some rupees from Giri.</i>

212
00:12:06,876 --> 00:12:08,667
<i>We were going to Paris.</i>

213
00:13:07,042 --> 00:13:09,084
Go, you are free now.
Find another family.

214
00:13:10,209 --> 00:13:11,834
Watch over me, Moohini!

215
00:13:16,376 --> 00:13:17,376
Go!

216
00:13:18,501 --> 00:13:20,751
<i>With nothing more than my mother's ashes,</i>

217
00:13:21,084 --> 00:13:24,001
<i>a passport
and a fake 100 euro,</i>

218
00:13:24,209 --> 00:13:26,626
<i>I flew hundreds of miles to Paris,</i>

219
00:13:26,751 --> 00:13:28,417
<i>in search of my father.</i>

220
00:13:52,917 --> 00:13:55,084
Is this your first time in Paris?

221
00:13:55,103 --> 00:13:56,503
Uh, yes.

222
00:13:57,334 --> 00:13:58,251
That's perfect.

223
00:13:58,376 --> 00:13:59,792
You want a taxi?

224
00:14:00,501 --> 00:14:03,084
- That's why I...
- Please, follow me.

225
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:05,084
Where do you want to go first?

226
00:14:05,209 --> 00:14:08,334
Some people want to see
the Eiffel Tower.

227
00:14:09,292 --> 00:14:10,626
That's an obvious choice.

228
00:14:10,751 --> 00:14:14,542
But some people dream of Montmartre,
others go to the Louvre.

229
00:14:14,667 --> 00:14:16,709
Some want to see the Champs-Élysées.

230
00:14:16,834 --> 00:14:19,376
Paris
is the most beautiful city in the world.

231
00:14:19,501 --> 00:14:22,084
You will see it all
for the first time.

232
00:14:22,542 --> 00:14:24,667
The Arc de Triomphe
for the first time.

233
00:14:24,792 --> 00:14:26,751
The Jardin Du Luxembourg
for the first time.

234
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:30,001
This will be the
most beautiful day of your life.

235
00:14:30,126 --> 00:14:33,167
You'll tell your children and your
grandchildren about this day.

236
00:14:33,834 --> 00:14:35,126
You are lucky man.

237
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:38,434
I don't know if there is
Uber in your country,

238
00:14:38,801 --> 00:14:41,176
but in Paris,
they are killing the taxi industry.

239
00:14:41,584 --> 00:14:44,001
They're stealing our jobs.
It's not right.

240
00:14:44,126 --> 00:14:45,717
Uber is hell.

241
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:47,742
Now I have to work a second job
on the weekend.

242
00:14:48,501 --> 00:14:49,501
So, what do you do?

243
00:14:51,501 --> 00:14:52,501
Uber.

244
00:14:53,876 --> 00:14:56,209
What is the government thinking?

245
00:14:56,667 --> 00:14:58,292
<i>And then I realize,</i>

246
00:14:58,417 --> 00:15:01,209
<i>this man
was stealing from me.</i>

247
00:15:01,976 --> 00:15:04,309
<i>Gustave was a thief.</i>

248
00:15:06,976 --> 00:15:08,267
<i>He was terrific.</i>

249
00:15:08,792 --> 00:15:11,167
<i>Polite, lively conversation.</i>

250
00:15:11,292 --> 00:15:13,792
<i>A very endearing personality.</i>

251
00:15:14,459 --> 00:15:17,459
<i>I should have been furious,
but I was not,</i>

252
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:20,001
<i>because I realize that
for the first time in my life,</i>

253
00:15:20,751 --> 00:15:23,709
<i>I, was the rich tourist.</i>

254
00:15:34,084 --> 00:15:35,751
Aja, do you have my telephone number?

255
00:15:35,876 --> 00:15:37,667
Yes, absolutely.

256
00:15:38,917 --> 00:15:40,042
Here you go.

257
00:15:40,751 --> 00:15:42,709
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

258
00:15:43,001 --> 00:15:45,334
Gustave,
it's an honor

259
00:15:46,017 --> 00:15:48,117
and a privilege
to have met you.

260
00:15:48,501 --> 00:15:51,501
No, it's an honor is for me
to have met you.

261
00:15:52,126 --> 00:15:53,326
- See you soon.
- See you soon.

262
00:16:11,334 --> 00:16:13,251
Such a beautiful city.

263
00:16:13,417 --> 00:16:14,876
And so many choices.

264
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:17,292
So, where did you want to go first?

265
00:16:18,542 --> 00:16:21,209
My favorite furniture store.

266
00:16:32,084 --> 00:16:35,209
Hedar och Skogar.

267
00:16:36,209 --> 00:16:39,084
Best loveseat ever.

268
00:16:49,459 --> 00:16:52,251
The extraordinary Vinterdimma collection.

269
00:16:52,792 --> 00:16:55,417
Döva Tidvatten,
cushion collection.

270
00:16:55,792 --> 00:16:57,751
The elegant Sharton collection.

271
00:17:00,667 --> 00:17:02,626
The Brandchat collection.

272
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,050
- <i>Have you ever been in love?</i>
- <i>No.</i>

273
00:17:24,417 --> 00:17:25,084
You,

274
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:27,251
have you been in love?

275
00:17:27,626 --> 00:17:28,792
I am 13 years old.

276
00:17:29,292 --> 00:17:30,917
- He likes Naveena.
- No, I don't.

277
00:17:31,084 --> 00:17:32,709
She is 16 years old
and he loves her.

278
00:17:32,834 --> 00:17:33,626
Shut up!

279
00:17:33,751 --> 00:17:35,001
He doesn't like her?

280
00:17:35,126 --> 00:17:36,417
Yes, he loves her!

281
00:17:36,501 --> 00:17:38,584
Don't say that
or I'll hit you.

282
00:17:38,876 --> 00:17:40,001
Stop.

283
00:17:40,501 --> 00:17:41,292
It's OK.

284
00:17:42,084 --> 00:17:43,792
It doesn't matter
if you're in love with Naveena.

285
00:17:43,917 --> 00:17:44,876
I'm not in love with her!

286
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,400
Okay,
OK.

287
00:17:49,251 --> 00:17:50,459
Anyway...

288
00:17:51,876 --> 00:17:55,501
Due to a unique
geomagnetic field,

289
00:17:56,126 --> 00:17:57,167
love in Paris

290
00:17:57,292 --> 00:17:59,584
<i>is ten times stronger than anywhere else.</i>

291
00:17:59,709 --> 00:18:01,376
<i>For hundreds of hundreds of years,</i>

292
00:18:01,501 --> 00:18:05,001
love in Paris
has inspired many books,

293
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:09,292
films, songs, poems, paintings.

294
00:18:09,417 --> 00:18:10,501
Have you heard of this?

295
00:18:11,627 --> 00:18:12,427
No.

296
00:18:12,501 --> 00:18:13,501
What they teach you in school?

297
00:18:14,542 --> 00:18:15,709
We don't go to school.

298
00:18:18,334 --> 00:18:20,126
You don't go to school...

299
00:18:20,542 --> 00:18:23,292
Honey, I'm so sorry,
I'm late from work.

300
00:18:23,417 --> 00:18:25,459
It's just the traffic was crazy.

301
00:18:28,251 --> 00:18:30,751
And I promised you dinner.
Please do not get mad at me.

302
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:33,876
I'll cook for you.
It'll be delicious.

303
00:18:39,834 --> 00:18:42,859
Sorry, I really have to test the
living room before buying them.

304
00:18:42,942 --> 00:18:45,026
You see, living rooms are not
just about the designs

305
00:18:45,751 --> 00:18:48,292
but about...
how you feel

306
00:18:48,417 --> 00:18:49,792
- when you enter them.
- Hm.

307
00:18:52,813 --> 00:18:53,813
Okay...

308
00:18:57,926 --> 00:19:00,134
Honey,
I can't find the keys to my car.

309
00:19:02,126 --> 00:19:03,126
Have you found them?

310
00:19:07,042 --> 00:19:07,834
Oh my God!

311
00:19:08,334 --> 00:19:10,751
My boss is driving me nuts.

312
00:19:13,751 --> 00:19:16,209
Is the pressure getting to you,
honey?

313
00:19:17,292 --> 00:19:18,542
How could you do this to me?

314
00:19:18,667 --> 00:19:20,042
With my own brother?

315
00:19:20,167 --> 00:19:21,584
What? No, no!
I am not his brother.

316
00:19:21,709 --> 00:19:24,084
Your brother and I are in love.

317
00:19:24,209 --> 00:19:25,709
We are moving to Guatemala.

318
00:19:26,019 --> 00:19:27,019
No...

319
00:19:27,459 --> 00:19:30,376
Not Guatemala.
Not Guatemala!

320
00:19:32,042 --> 00:19:33,417
I'm pregnant.

321
00:19:34,001 --> 00:19:35,001
What?

322
00:19:35,184 --> 00:19:38,934
Because of Paris's
unique geomagnetic field,

323
00:19:39,501 --> 00:19:42,501
Marie and I
bonded instantaneously.

324
00:19:42,584 --> 00:19:46,334
Why would a beautiful American girl
be interested in a fakir from India?

325
00:19:47,584 --> 00:19:48,876
I don't know.

326
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:52,709
But chance
finally seem to run my side.

327
00:19:53,126 --> 00:19:54,251
That day,

328
00:19:54,501 --> 00:19:57,834
Marie listened to me when
I told her all about India.

329
00:19:59,542 --> 00:20:01,167
<i>About the colors and sounds.</i>

330
00:20:01,751 --> 00:20:03,376
<i>Dresses, tastes.</i>

331
00:20:03,501 --> 00:20:05,001
<i>Its hundreds of languages.</i>

332
00:20:05,501 --> 00:20:07,417
<i>Religions and customs.</i>

333
00:20:07,592 --> 00:20:09,301
<i>About the immensity of Bombay</i>

334
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:12,751
<i>and the charm
of my small neighborhood.</i>

335
00:20:22,584 --> 00:20:24,626
Only in the deepest part of India.

336
00:20:27,001 --> 00:20:28,626
I have to...
go.

337
00:20:29,792 --> 00:20:31,051
Since I left Chicago,

338
00:20:31,076 --> 00:20:35,284
I worked at a really,
really boring U.S. consulting company.

339
00:20:35,709 --> 00:20:38,001
It's called Wilson & Williams.

340
00:20:38,126 --> 00:20:40,251
Why did you leave Chicago?

341
00:20:41,834 --> 00:20:45,209
Well, I left with my
best friend, Rose.

342
00:20:45,542 --> 00:20:49,292
My parents hate her.
They think she's a bad influence.

343
00:20:49,667 --> 00:20:51,367
- Is she?
- No.

344
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:56,251
My parents blame her for me leaving
my future husband at the altar.

345
00:20:58,729 --> 00:20:59,929
- Wow.
- Yeah.

346
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,200
Okay. Um...

347
00:21:07,251 --> 00:21:09,084
I want you to have
this newspaper clipping.

348
00:21:10,542 --> 00:21:11,342
Why?

349
00:21:11,542 --> 00:21:14,242
Because it's like a promise
that we see each other again.

350
00:21:15,042 --> 00:21:18,126
Since it's... very,
very important to me.

351
00:21:19,067 --> 00:21:20,067
I...

352
00:21:20,459 --> 00:21:23,251
And...
I'll have your pen.

353
00:21:23,751 --> 00:21:25,292
How did you...

354
00:21:25,501 --> 00:21:26,501
I'll see you tomorrow?

355
00:21:26,709 --> 00:21:27,542
I don't know...

356
00:21:27,667 --> 00:21:29,084
At the Eiffel Tower?

357
00:21:30,417 --> 00:21:31,376
Seven o'clock?

358
00:21:31,501 --> 00:21:33,251
Okay, but this is not a date.

359
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:34,709
- You don't date?
- No.

360
00:21:35,167 --> 00:21:36,459
I don't date, ever.

361
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,100
Oh...

362
00:21:49,626 --> 00:21:53,542
Here in Paris, we...
we usually do it on the cheeks.

363
00:21:54,001 --> 00:21:55,376
I'm so sorry.

364
00:21:55,751 --> 00:21:57,084
It's okay.

365
00:21:57,727 --> 00:21:59,927
Uh...
Huh...

366
00:22:20,501 --> 00:22:24,001
I always thinking that maybe
I could become a lesbian.

367
00:22:25,501 --> 00:22:26,167
Why?

368
00:22:26,376 --> 00:22:27,459
Why not?

369
00:22:27,792 --> 00:22:31,626
I mean you don't like
sleeping with women and...

370
00:22:32,001 --> 00:22:35,167
From what I heard that's a
pretty big part of being a lesbian.

371
00:22:35,292 --> 00:22:37,501
Well, I could learn to like it.

372
00:22:37,667 --> 00:22:40,392
You know, I hated
eating broccoli when I was a kid.

373
00:22:40,417 --> 00:22:42,417
Now, I eat broccoli all the time.

374
00:22:42,751 --> 00:22:45,917
And... It's such a cool lifestyle.

375
00:22:46,084 --> 00:22:48,167
Rose, you're 27 years old.

376
00:22:48,292 --> 00:22:50,834
I think you would known by now
if you were a lesbian.

377
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,400
Hm, hum...

378
00:23:03,084 --> 00:23:03,709
What?

379
00:23:05,167 --> 00:23:08,367
- I may have... met someone.
- Oh my God!

380
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,800
- At last! Oh my God!
- Wait. Wait, wait, wait...

381
00:23:13,292 --> 00:23:14,501
Is it a girl?

382
00:23:17,084 --> 00:23:18,792
<i>Since I had no money,</i>

383
00:23:18,917 --> 00:23:21,376
<i>I chose to stay there for the night.</i>

384
00:23:42,709 --> 00:23:44,209
Exhausted by my travels,

385
00:23:44,751 --> 00:23:46,501
I quickly fell asleep.

386
00:23:46,667 --> 00:23:47,584
Unfortunately,

387
00:23:47,709 --> 00:23:49,376
<i>I was mistaken.</i>

388
00:23:49,501 --> 00:23:52,167
<i>Chance,
was still not on my side.</i>

389
00:23:52,292 --> 00:23:53,501
<i>Not at all.</i>

390
00:23:54,001 --> 00:23:55,501
<i>In the middle of the night,</i>

391
00:23:55,626 --> 00:23:57,917
<i>out of the 2,000 pieces of furniture...</i>

392
00:23:58,084 --> 00:23:58,792
That one.

393
00:23:58,917 --> 00:24:01,209
<i>...and 15 different wardrobes,</i>

394
00:24:01,376 --> 00:24:04,459
<i>mine was the one
they had to pick.</i>

395
00:24:04,917 --> 00:24:08,001
<i>Chance,
was definitely not on my side.</i>

396
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:31,667
[Welcome to England]

397
00:24:41,001 --> 00:24:43,042
Where are we?
Where are we going?

398
00:24:43,167 --> 00:24:44,709
We're heading to
the land of milk and honey.

399
00:24:45,001 --> 00:24:46,209
Milk and honey?

400
00:24:46,334 --> 00:24:47,784
- London.
- London?

401
00:24:48,292 --> 00:24:50,459
Yes, where everything
grows in abundance,

402
00:24:50,876 --> 00:24:52,792
where there are cars,
houses and jobs.

403
00:24:52,917 --> 00:24:55,001
Beer. Lots of beer.

404
00:24:55,667 --> 00:24:56,584
We don't drink beer.

405
00:24:56,709 --> 00:24:57,751
We hate beer.

406
00:24:58,626 --> 00:25:01,167
You all, illegal immigrants?

407
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:02,834
And you are not?

408
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,876
No, I am a tourist.

409
00:25:05,042 --> 00:25:05,834
A tourist?

410
00:25:06,751 --> 00:25:08,084
Traveling in a wardrobe?

411
00:25:08,377 --> 00:25:09,177
Yes,

412
00:25:09,209 --> 00:25:10,917
you are doing
the famous wardrobe tour.

413
00:25:12,459 --> 00:25:14,526
Wardrobes have great leg room.

414
00:25:14,909 --> 00:25:15,709
Yes,

415
00:25:15,834 --> 00:25:18,834
I traveled to Bora Bora
in a business class wardrobe.

416
00:25:20,084 --> 00:25:22,001
No. Really,
I'm a tourist.

417
00:25:22,126 --> 00:25:23,209
We're all tourists.

418
00:25:23,334 --> 00:25:25,667
I have my passport.
I'm from India. See...

419
00:25:26,501 --> 00:25:27,292
See.

420
00:25:30,251 --> 00:25:31,042
Somalia.

421
00:25:32,096 --> 00:25:32,896
Somalia.

422
00:25:33,376 --> 00:25:35,334
We have been traveling
for 18 months.

423
00:25:36,084 --> 00:25:38,459
We've been walking for
weeks and weeks.

424
00:25:38,542 --> 00:25:41,334
Actually, in the beginning,
there were many more of us.

425
00:25:41,792 --> 00:25:42,584
In Libya,

426
00:25:42,709 --> 00:25:44,751
we've been attacked by bandits.

427
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:47,209
The smugglers sank our ship

428
00:25:47,417 --> 00:25:49,751
two miles from the Italian coast.

429
00:25:51,792 --> 00:25:54,751
Only a few of us
made it to the Italian shore.

430
00:25:55,251 --> 00:25:57,584
Then we crossed
the French border.

431
00:25:58,667 --> 00:26:00,876
Now, it's only five of us left.

432
00:26:01,834 --> 00:26:04,417
Why would you
go through all of this?

433
00:26:05,334 --> 00:26:08,751
Our families has been displaced
by war.

434
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,260
We must send money to them.

435
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,680
They are starving.

436
00:26:17,084 --> 00:26:18,417
Isn't it the same for you?

437
00:26:20,001 --> 00:26:21,542
I am a tourist.

438
00:26:21,667 --> 00:26:24,626
There is African proverb,
it says:

439
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:29,200
"He who swallows coconut (whole)
has faith in his buttock."

440
00:26:31,792 --> 00:26:33,459
I don't see the relevance.

441
00:26:33,542 --> 00:26:34,792
No relevance.

442
00:26:35,376 --> 00:26:36,834
I just love the proverb.

443
00:26:38,792 --> 00:26:40,042
Why are we stopping?

444
00:26:40,167 --> 00:26:41,459
- What's happening?
- Shh...

445
00:26:46,042 --> 00:26:47,751
- Dog...
- What dog?

446
00:26:47,876 --> 00:26:48,834
Let's run.

447
00:27:01,584 --> 00:27:02,876
Border police.

448
00:27:03,042 --> 00:27:03,834
I have my passport.

449
00:27:04,001 --> 00:27:05,417
Never show your passport.

450
00:27:05,584 --> 00:27:06,417
Go, go, go,
go, go.

451
00:27:11,459 --> 00:27:12,459
- Freeze!
- Police!

452
00:27:12,542 --> 00:27:14,042
Police!
Stop!

453
00:27:14,667 --> 00:27:15,459
Bloody hell!

454
00:27:17,501 --> 00:27:18,301
Moohini!

455
00:27:18,542 --> 00:27:21,501
Moohini, aren't you supposed to
watch over me?

456
00:27:27,292 --> 00:27:28,459
Go left!
Go left!

457
00:27:52,876 --> 00:27:54,626
I cannot go back.

458
00:27:57,876 --> 00:27:59,501
Hey you, stop!

459
00:28:02,501 --> 00:28:03,751
C'mon over here!

460
00:28:09,626 --> 00:28:10,709
Okay, hold it right there!

461
00:28:11,501 --> 00:28:12,584
Wait.

462
00:28:20,126 --> 00:28:22,626
I am Ajatashatru Lavash Patel,

463
00:28:24,042 --> 00:28:26,501
a famous fakir, from India.

464
00:28:26,584 --> 00:28:28,459
Well, good for fucking you.

465
00:28:28,667 --> 00:28:31,667
I'm going to make my friend
here...

466
00:28:32,292 --> 00:28:33,751
disappear...

467
00:28:34,584 --> 00:28:37,417
and reappear far away.

468
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:40,251
This I must see.

469
00:28:52,167 --> 00:28:53,626
Right, Copperfield,
where is he?

470
00:28:57,501 --> 00:28:58,834
Oh, shit!

471
00:28:59,667 --> 00:29:01,584
I'll get that one.
You look after the fakir.

472
00:29:02,892 --> 00:29:04,059
Alright, sunshine.

473
00:29:05,167 --> 00:29:06,584
No more funny business,
okay?

474
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:14,001
- I said "No more funny business."
- Okay, OK.

475
00:29:15,417 --> 00:29:16,251
Let's go.

476
00:29:16,751 --> 00:29:18,584
Just this one, last one.

477
00:29:20,126 --> 00:29:21,542
Put these back on.

478
00:29:21,876 --> 00:29:23,209
Kinda like this?

479
00:29:23,626 --> 00:29:26,209
No, no, no, no, no.
We need the documents ready.

480
00:29:26,334 --> 00:29:27,126
Sir!

481
00:29:27,251 --> 00:29:28,051
Sir, it's a mistake!

482
00:29:28,151 --> 00:29:29,438
I am not part of
this group, sir!

483
00:29:29,441 --> 00:29:30,311
I'm not in this group.

484
00:29:30,642 --> 00:29:32,459
Sir, this man is right.

485
00:29:32,542 --> 00:29:34,001
This man is telling the truth.

486
00:29:34,126 --> 00:29:37,084
No one in this group
is part of this group.

487
00:29:37,301 --> 00:29:38,101
Yes.

488
00:29:39,834 --> 00:29:42,376
Sir, please, I have to
go back to Paris.

489
00:29:42,792 --> 00:29:44,501
Houdini,
come with me.

490
00:29:45,667 --> 00:29:46,709
Sir!

491
00:29:48,176 --> 00:29:49,776
- This yours?
- Yes.

492
00:29:51,876 --> 00:29:53,542
What are you doing?
That's my passport!

493
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:54,501
It was a fake.

494
00:29:55,167 --> 00:29:56,209
No! It wasn't!

495
00:29:56,334 --> 00:29:58,542
You have talent:
You make people disappear.

496
00:29:58,667 --> 00:30:00,167
I make fake fake passports disappear.

497
00:30:00,292 --> 00:30:01,334
But that's my passport!

498
00:30:01,459 --> 00:30:03,209
Let's not dwell on the past, should we?
What about this?

499
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:04,167
Real?

500
00:30:04,292 --> 00:30:05,209
Fake?
Fake, real, fake, real...

501
00:30:09,101 --> 00:30:10,542
- False.
- Fake, yep.

502
00:30:12,876 --> 00:30:15,376
Here... is your pen,

503
00:30:16,709 --> 00:30:18,292
your photos

504
00:30:18,459 --> 00:30:19,501
and the...

505
00:30:21,209 --> 00:30:24,209
You can even keep this
love letter from your father.

506
00:30:26,876 --> 00:30:28,251
Very well written.

507
00:30:29,917 --> 00:30:30,584
Poignant.

508
00:30:31,376 --> 00:30:33,084
He kept that bullshit real.

509
00:30:33,626 --> 00:30:34,459
Now,

510
00:30:34,834 --> 00:30:37,501
here
is a map

511
00:30:37,584 --> 00:30:39,417
of the world.

512
00:30:39,501 --> 00:30:40,376
This...

513
00:30:41,584 --> 00:30:42,751
is England.

514
00:30:42,876 --> 00:30:43,834
There is no map.

515
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:47,334
Yes, yes.
Usually we have a map here.

516
00:30:48,126 --> 00:30:48,792
Bear with me.

517
00:30:48,917 --> 00:30:50,459
You are not allowed

518
00:30:50,542 --> 00:30:51,292
here. Yes?

519
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,625
You,

520
00:30:52,792 --> 00:30:54,167
not allowed

521
00:30:54,501 --> 00:30:55,459
here.

522
00:30:56,001 --> 00:30:58,001
Do you understand English?

523
00:30:58,125 --> 00:31:00,650
- We have been speaking English.
- Answer the question is part of our protocol.

524
00:31:00,851 --> 00:31:01,651
Yes!

525
00:31:01,667 --> 00:31:03,167
Where do you...

526
00:31:03,292 --> 00:31:04,084
you...

527
00:31:04,209 --> 00:31:04,834
where

528
00:31:05,001 --> 00:31:07,334
do you
want to go?

529
00:31:07,459 --> 00:31:08,126
Where?

530
00:31:08,626 --> 00:31:10,301
- Paris!
- Ah, Pa--ri--s.

531
00:31:12,501 --> 00:31:13,812
If we send you back to France,

532
00:31:13,815 --> 00:31:15,994
you'll be right back here next week
with your little Hangö face

533
00:31:16,017 --> 00:31:17,184
and a brand new name

534
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:18,876
on a brand new fake passport.

535
00:31:19,042 --> 00:31:20,501
But I don't want to come to England.

536
00:31:21,209 --> 00:31:22,001
Is it the weather?

537
00:31:22,044 --> 00:31:22,844
No!

538
00:31:23,151 --> 00:31:23,942
You lost.
Gerard!

539
00:31:26,167 --> 00:31:29,417
I'm going to ask you to
sign your statement.

540
00:31:29,751 --> 00:31:31,501
But I've not made any statement yet.

541
00:31:31,876 --> 00:31:33,501
I know, I know.

542
00:31:35,142 --> 00:31:35,942
Oh...

543
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:38,392
Oh, you are serious.
Rights, okay... Hm...

544
00:31:39,376 --> 00:31:40,792
Yep, go on then.

545
00:31:42,626 --> 00:31:46,334
I admit that I stayed back
in the Swedish furniture store.

546
00:31:46,459 --> 00:31:48,542
I was afraid
they might think I'm a thief.

547
00:31:48,667 --> 00:31:52,084
I hid in a wardrobe.
But that was my only crime.

548
00:31:52,251 --> 00:31:54,501
My mother is still there,
in a vase.

549
00:31:54,626 --> 00:31:57,542
She is dead.
Then I met Marie.

550
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:01,376
You are not taking any notes!

551
00:32:01,626 --> 00:32:03,751
No, no.
I prefer my statement.

552
00:32:05,876 --> 00:32:07,667
Let me let you in to a secret.

553
00:32:08,751 --> 00:32:10,292
We have a charter plane...

554
00:32:10,834 --> 00:32:12,167
booked for Spain,

555
00:32:12,459 --> 00:32:15,251
but not a single illegal here
is actually from there.

556
00:32:16,001 --> 00:32:19,001
Can... Can you please just
send me back to Paris?

557
00:32:19,126 --> 00:32:20,542

Step aside.

595
00:34:21,751 --> 00:34:22,667
Come on.

596
00:34:24,126 --> 00:34:25,042
Papers.

597
00:34:27,709 --> 00:34:29,126
No papers.

598
00:34:29,917 --> 00:34:31,684
- Are you Spanish?
- No.

599
00:34:36,217 --> 00:34:38,167
Anyone here from Spain?

600
00:34:41,584 --> 00:34:46,584
Does anyone here actually have
any connection whatsoever to Spain?

601
00:34:49,376 --> 00:34:50,126
What about you?

602
00:34:50,417 --> 00:34:53,126
I am British.

603
00:34:53,501 --> 00:34:54,501
I am Swiss.

604
00:34:54,951 --> 00:34:56,451
"Maigaru, fina buda."

605
00:34:57,667 --> 00:34:59,626
And we have arrived in Barcelona,

606
00:35:00,542 --> 00:35:03,501
there was a huge,
huge war going on

607
00:35:03,584 --> 00:35:05,459
between Captain Smith

608
00:35:05,709 --> 00:35:07,142
and Inspector Fernandez.

609
00:35:07,192 --> 00:35:11,317
- Respectfully, UK would not tolerate its loss flouted by your migrants.
- Respectfully, the Spanish kingdom will not have your migrants...

610
00:35:12,084 --> 00:35:13,417
You mistake...

611
00:35:13,501 --> 00:35:17,167
We will not suffer the consequences
of your lax approach to border control.

612
00:35:17,192 --> 00:35:18,392
- Stupid cow!
- Tú boogers!

613
00:35:35,626 --> 00:35:38,542
<i>We ended up as hostages to this dispute.</i>

614
00:35:41,584 --> 00:35:43,292
<i>We were prisoners.</i>

615
00:35:58,334 --> 00:35:59,542
<i>Please tell me you are calling...</i>

616
00:35:59,667 --> 00:36:01,751
Because you feeling guilty
for having sex on your first date,

617
00:36:02,209 --> 00:36:06,584
which you insisted is not an official date,
which remind you most definitely is.

618
00:36:06,709 --> 00:36:07,751
Unfortunately, not,

619
00:36:07,876 --> 00:36:12,001
given that it's impossible to have sex
with someone who never show up.

620
00:36:12,542 --> 00:36:13,751
Technically, that's not true.

621
00:36:13,876 --> 00:36:16,834
With apps like Snapchat,
you can send really hot pictures of your...

622
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:17,700
Rose.

623
00:36:17,751 --> 00:36:19,917
And then he warps it out
and takes a picture of his...

624
00:36:19,976 --> 00:36:20,776
Rose!

625
00:36:21,001 --> 00:36:22,001
You messed up.

626
00:36:22,834 --> 00:36:23,626
Why?

627
00:36:23,751 --> 00:36:25,459
It's like your aborted marriage.

628
00:36:25,542 --> 00:36:26,501
Don't go there.

629
00:36:26,626 --> 00:36:28,001
Yes, yes, I'm...
I'm going there.

630
00:36:28,126 --> 00:36:28,751
Don't go there.

631
00:36:28,876 --> 00:36:30,834
<i>Too late, I'm already there.</i>

632
00:36:31,251 --> 00:36:34,167
You over think things,
you complicate everything.

633
00:36:34,334 --> 00:36:35,542
You're a stick-in-the-mud.

634
00:36:35,667 --> 00:36:37,223
Ever since the marriage fiasco,

635
00:36:37,226 --> 00:36:39,836
you've become the most boring
<i>person in the world.</i>

636
00:36:40,001 --> 00:36:41,209
<i>I mean, relax!</i>

637
00:36:41,334 --> 00:36:43,834
Live a little.
You're in Paris, for Christ's sake!

638
00:36:43,946 --> 00:36:44,746
OK.

639
00:36:45,376 --> 00:36:47,126
You should become a lesbian, like me.

640
00:36:47,251 --> 00:36:48,292
You're not lesbian.

641
00:36:48,417 --> 00:36:49,751
Yes, I am.

642
00:36:50,376 --> 00:36:52,584
It's all about the life style, Marie.

643
00:36:52,709 --> 00:36:54,209
I'll think about it.

644
00:37:05,501 --> 00:37:08,501
Excuse me, I'm sorry.
Um... Can I ask you something?

645
00:37:08,751 --> 00:37:10,501
My phone just die.

646
00:37:11,417 --> 00:37:14,917
Is this the...
the way to the Trocadero metro station?

647
00:37:16,877 --> 00:37:18,177
- Ah, yeah.
- Yeah?

648
00:37:18,834 --> 00:37:20,542
Ah, thank you, that's great.

649
00:37:21,751 --> 00:37:22,751
Yeah, just that way.

650
00:37:23,096 --> 00:37:25,096
- Where are you from?
- America.

651
00:37:35,667 --> 00:37:36,751
Look at them.

652
00:37:38,126 --> 00:37:40,167
How's life fair?

653
00:37:40,501 --> 00:37:44,792
How can it be that the same people
always get all the chances in life?

654
00:37:44,917 --> 00:37:47,084
There is no such thing as chance.

655
00:37:48,126 --> 00:37:49,542
Karma is everything.

656
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:52,292
Karma is the fate we deserve.

657
00:37:52,417 --> 00:37:54,501
I must have been a real
asshole in another life.

658
00:37:59,501 --> 00:38:00,501
Karma.

659
00:38:01,417 --> 00:38:03,501
The media didn't cover the story.

660
00:38:04,001 --> 00:38:05,667
No one seem to care.

661
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:07,584
We were stuck.

662
00:38:07,709 --> 00:38:09,042
So, what did you do, dude?

663
00:38:11,001 --> 00:38:12,501
I worked on my karma...

664
00:38:16,292 --> 00:38:18,292
<i>So I could get back to Paris.</i>

665
00:39:16,042 --> 00:39:18,167
Your name.
Which one is your name?

666
00:39:18,292 --> 00:39:20,459
There are 4 different names.

667
00:39:55,692 --> 00:39:57,025
<i>Thank you, everyone.</i>

668
00:39:57,134 --> 00:40:00,009
Aw, I need some new ideas
for our cosmetics market.

669
00:40:00,034 --> 00:40:01,901
And, as of Monday,

670
00:40:01,926 --> 00:40:05,301
Marie will be our
new V.P. Marketing.

671
00:40:07,584 --> 00:40:08,917
Congratulations.

672
00:40:09,626 --> 00:40:11,376
Some more cheese.

673
00:40:15,301 --> 00:40:17,259
That is... way too much.

674
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:21,667
- Yeah, but eh, we are celebrating.
- Yeah.

675
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:24,660
So, yes...

676
00:40:25,876 --> 00:40:27,276
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

677
00:40:27,584 --> 00:40:30,584
To your well-deserved promotion,
and...

678
00:40:31,709 --> 00:40:32,667
And?

679
00:40:33,209 --> 00:40:36,751
And, I decided to more to Paris
on a permanent bases.

680
00:40:40,242 --> 00:40:41,442
Wow!
Um...

681
00:40:44,042 --> 00:40:45,167
Permanent...
Wow.

682
00:40:47,417 --> 00:40:49,376
That's great. That's so...
That's great.

683
00:40:55,501 --> 00:40:57,001
Peter's moving to Paris.

684
00:40:57,501 --> 00:40:58,584
That's great.

685
00:40:58,917 --> 00:41:00,751
Yeah.
Yeah, it's great.

686
00:41:00,876 --> 00:41:03,209
He is...
He's great.

687
00:41:04,167 --> 00:41:05,792
Rose, my life is perfect.

688
00:41:06,376 --> 00:41:07,917
It's absolutely perfect.

689
00:41:08,084 --> 00:41:09,667
Did you know that

690
00:41:10,126 --> 00:41:12,584
he carried me in his arms

691
00:41:12,709 --> 00:41:15,209
for several blocks
because I hurt my foot?

692
00:41:15,792 --> 00:41:18,417
And then,
he proceeded to massage my foot

693
00:41:18,501 --> 00:41:21,459
with a god-like healing touch.
And,

694
00:41:22,042 --> 00:41:23,501
whenever we go to a restaurant,

695
00:41:23,584 --> 00:41:26,709
He speaks to the waiter
in their native tongue.

696
00:41:30,334 --> 00:41:32,084
Can we talk about this tomorrow?

697
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:34,220
Yep.

698
00:41:36,792 --> 00:41:39,834
I think I may not be a lesbian.

699
00:42:23,501 --> 00:42:24,459
<i>Karma.</i>

700
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:26,084
<i>It works</i>

701
00:42:26,542 --> 00:42:28,042
<i>every time.</i>

702
00:43:26,251 --> 00:43:27,667
<i>In that confined space,</i>

703
00:43:28,584 --> 00:43:31,209
<i>I felt the uncontrollable urge to write</i>

704
00:43:31,334 --> 00:43:33,501
<i>the story of Master Deva.</i>

705
00:43:34,251 --> 00:43:36,251
<i>A very wise and wonderful man</i>

706
00:43:36,376 --> 00:43:38,042
<i>I met when I ended up in jail.</i>

707
00:43:38,459 --> 00:43:39,667
You've been to jail?

708
00:43:41,626 --> 00:43:43,126
Yes, मेरे दोस्त। (my friend).

709
00:43:43,584 --> 00:43:45,459
And I was even younger than you.

710
00:43:46,792 --> 00:43:50,751
<i>I was confined in a tiny cell,
with no bed and no window.</i>

711
00:43:54,501 --> 00:43:56,042
Bastard!

712
00:43:56,167 --> 00:43:58,501
You'll go to hell!

713
00:43:58,584 --> 00:44:02,042
Your mother must be stupid
to have you this garbage!

714
00:44:02,167 --> 00:44:03,334
You're dirt!

715
00:44:03,459 --> 00:44:05,001
You sewerage rat.

716
00:44:05,126 --> 00:44:06,501
You swine!

717
00:44:06,584 --> 00:44:07,834
You cockroach!

718
00:44:08,001 --> 00:44:10,876
You jerk!
Get me out of here!

719
00:44:14,376 --> 00:44:15,584
I want to go home.

720
00:44:17,584 --> 00:44:19,001
<i>After couple of weeks,</i>

721
00:44:19,126 --> 00:44:21,251
<i>I was driven crazy by hunger,</i>

722
00:44:21,376 --> 00:44:22,667
<i>solitude</i>

723
00:44:23,334 --> 00:44:27,001
<i>and the fact I thought my mother
would never want to see me again.</i>

724
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:30,630
No...!!!

725
00:44:33,709 --> 00:44:35,251
Please help me, God!

726
00:44:35,542 --> 00:44:36,667
Please!

727
00:44:36,917 --> 00:44:39,917
For as long as I was in the jail,

728
00:44:40,251 --> 00:44:43,001
I was wonder
what my cousins were doing.

729
00:44:50,376 --> 00:44:52,667
How long are you in for?

730
00:44:52,792 --> 00:44:53,876
I don't know.

731
00:44:54,542 --> 00:44:56,459
I don't even have a window.

732
00:44:56,542 --> 00:45:00,151
I have a window.
I could tell you what I see.

733
00:45:02,676 --> 00:45:06,084
Children are playing
with a ball in the street.

734
00:45:06,209 --> 00:45:08,584
That's market day.

735
00:45:08,709 --> 00:45:11,334
Traders are setting up stalls.

736
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:15,292
A woman is sunbathing in the balcony.

737
00:45:15,417 --> 00:45:19,792
A mother is taking water to
the children who are playing.

738
00:45:20,084 --> 00:45:23,751
They are fighting
who gets to drink first.

739
00:45:24,501 --> 00:45:28,126
The boys and girls are playing cricket
with sticks and...

740
00:45:28,251 --> 00:45:30,792
I hear music in the distance...

741
00:45:32,542 --> 00:45:34,417
...making a mess all around!

742
00:45:34,501 --> 00:45:38,792
There is a young man with a light beard
with bright clever eyes.

743
00:45:38,917 --> 00:45:40,626
He's in love.

744
00:45:41,542 --> 00:45:43,292
Can you hear that bird singing?

745
00:45:43,417 --> 00:45:45,167
What does it look like?

746
00:45:45,292 --> 00:45:47,917
Blue, red and yellow feathers.

747
00:45:48,084 --> 00:45:50,834
His eyes are like tiny olives.

748
00:45:53,209 --> 00:45:54,584
You are getting out now.

749
00:46:03,501 --> 00:46:05,042
Master Deva?

750
00:46:07,209 --> 00:46:08,917
I'm getting out now.

751
00:46:18,126 --> 00:46:20,042
<i>For the longest of time,</i>

752
00:46:20,167 --> 00:46:23,292
<i>I thought I would never
meet Master Deva again.</i>

753
00:46:27,751 --> 00:46:28,667
Mama!

754
00:46:37,042 --> 00:46:37,751
<i>Soon,</i>

755
00:46:38,459 --> 00:46:40,542
<i>I was back on the streets,</i>

756
00:46:40,834 --> 00:46:42,251
<i>with my cousins.</i>

757
00:46:46,417 --> 00:46:47,251
Aja?

758
00:46:50,084 --> 00:46:51,167
Master Deva?

759
00:46:52,001 --> 00:46:53,917
Aja, is that you?

760
00:47:03,126 --> 00:47:04,167
You're blind?

761
00:47:05,376 --> 00:47:07,917
Yes, I am blind.
But it doesn't matter...

762
00:47:08,084 --> 00:47:10,042
<i>His eyes couldn't see,</i>

763
00:47:10,167 --> 00:47:13,459
<i>but it didn't prevent him
from seeing with imaginations.</i>

764
00:47:14,084 --> 00:47:16,751
<i>Out of the darkest moment of my life,</i>

765
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:21,084
<i>Master Deva created
the most beautiful lesson.</i>

766
00:47:39,209 --> 00:47:41,501
Did you tell Alfredo
I was upset?

767
00:47:41,626 --> 00:47:43,809
Yes, I told him
you were very, very...

768
00:47:44,234 --> 00:47:46,042
very upset.
Yes.

769
00:47:46,501 --> 00:47:48,409
Does he know I'm
waiting for him in Paris?

770
00:47:48,686 --> 00:47:49,486
Yes.

771
00:47:50,376 --> 00:47:52,709
The re-shoot is only one day.

772
00:47:53,584 --> 00:47:54,709
That's a lie.

773
00:47:57,367 --> 00:47:59,209
Well, he promised,

774
00:47:59,334 --> 00:48:00,501
just one day.

775
00:48:01,501 --> 00:48:03,459
Yet, and Matthew calls

776
00:48:03,542 --> 00:48:07,626
and sent you three emails and
twenty-two texts.

777
00:48:08,501 --> 00:48:12,584
Well, may be next time he won't forget
to thank me at the Golden Globes.

778
00:48:13,638 --> 00:48:14,438
OK.

779
00:48:14,917 --> 00:48:19,042
Um, and then there is Mr. Burton he needs
to know if you read the fairy tale script

780
00:48:19,167 --> 00:48:22,792
and if you would consider playing
the role... of the... witch.

781
00:48:24,042 --> 00:48:25,042
A witch.

782
00:48:26,228 --> 00:48:27,228
- Yes.
- Yes.

783
00:48:28,334 --> 00:48:29,376
- The witch.
- The witch.

784
00:48:33,251 --> 00:48:34,542
Everyone out!

785
00:48:38,876 --> 00:48:40,584
I hate Rome.

786
00:49:13,626 --> 00:49:14,709
You don't need a gun.

787
00:49:15,709 --> 00:49:18,084
Why are you half naked
in my trunk?

788
00:49:18,251 --> 00:49:20,626
I had only my shirt to write on.

789
00:49:20,751 --> 00:49:23,251
I couldn't get it back on.

790
00:49:23,584 --> 00:49:24,459
I'm sorry.

791
00:49:24,542 --> 00:49:25,417
You're a writer?

792
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:28,300
Yes.

793
00:49:29,584 --> 00:49:31,459
I had no paper.

794
00:49:34,251 --> 00:49:35,584
Papers for the bettor.

795
00:49:36,126 --> 00:49:37,001
You're refugee?

796
00:49:42,976 --> 00:49:43,776
Yes.

797
00:49:44,501 --> 00:49:45,584
I'm a refugee.

798
00:49:54,292 --> 00:49:56,376
Aja, this is so touching.

799
00:49:58,251 --> 00:49:59,251
Thank you.

800
00:50:00,626 --> 00:50:03,042
I was...
I was overwhelmed by your story,

801
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:06,209
but it also helped me to
understand a great deal.

802
00:50:07,584 --> 00:50:09,667
I sometimes feel blind,

803
00:50:09,792 --> 00:50:11,334
just like your character.

804
00:50:13,209 --> 00:50:14,334
Excuse me.

805
00:50:18,792 --> 00:50:20,001
Good evening, Nelly.

806
00:50:20,792 --> 00:50:22,876
My God, you are beautiful.

807
00:50:23,042 --> 00:50:25,876
Beautiful, as always.

808
00:50:26,042 --> 00:50:29,051
- Alfredo, the director is an idiot.
- No, no, no, no.

809
00:50:29,751 --> 00:50:32,751
Nelly, Michael Zhudovski
is not an idiot, c'mon.

810
00:50:32,876 --> 00:50:34,209
He is an idiot.

811
00:50:34,876 --> 00:50:35,984
Yes, he's an idiot, but...

812
00:50:36,251 --> 00:50:38,326
Nelly, we have to finish this movie.

813
00:50:39,292 --> 00:50:41,251
If we don't finish this movie,
I'm ruined.

814
00:50:41,376 --> 00:50:42,751
Please, help me.

815
00:50:42,876 --> 00:50:44,584
The director is an idiot,
but...

816
00:50:44,709 --> 00:50:46,334
Come have dinner,
and we go out,

817
00:50:46,459 --> 00:50:48,334
have a drink,
just you and me.

818
00:50:48,459 --> 00:50:49,626
We are divorced, Alfredo.

819
00:50:49,751 --> 00:50:50,584
You divorced me!

820
00:50:51,817 --> 00:50:55,084
Nelly, please.
We just need five days of re-shoots.

821
00:51:00,628 --> 00:51:01,428
No!

822
00:51:01,917 --> 00:51:04,292
I can't believe it.
He is too young for you.

823
00:51:04,417 --> 00:51:05,501
He's a writer

824
00:51:05,584 --> 00:51:06,667
and an artist.

825
00:51:07,126 --> 00:51:09,626
He wrote his last work
on his shirt.

826
00:51:09,792 --> 00:51:11,584
Like the essence of Sufi poets.

827
00:51:11,709 --> 00:51:12,542
On his shirt?

828
00:51:12,667 --> 00:51:13,751
He didn't have any paper.

829
00:51:14,709 --> 00:51:17,167
Isn't that a grand artistic gesture?

830
00:51:17,292 --> 00:51:18,917
He took his shirt off his back

831
00:51:19,209 --> 00:51:20,667
to write a story.

832
00:51:21,626 --> 00:51:23,167
Why would anyone do that?

833
00:51:23,292 --> 00:51:24,209
It's art.

834
00:51:24,542 --> 00:51:25,251
Art?

835
00:51:25,417 --> 00:51:26,751
Yes, art.

836
00:51:34,209 --> 00:51:36,501
Nelly,
that's not art.

837
00:51:36,626 --> 00:51:38,001
Giancarlo wants to buy it.

838
00:51:41,792 --> 00:51:45,376
Why are you talking to Giancarlo?
What is it with Giancarlo?

839
00:51:45,792 --> 00:51:46,751
He calls me.

840
00:51:46,876 --> 00:51:48,292
Why does he call you?

841
00:51:48,417 --> 00:51:49,542
He calls.

842
00:51:54,667 --> 00:51:56,334
- Giancarlo wants to buy that?
- Yes.

843
00:51:56,459 --> 00:51:57,751
- How much?
- I can't say.

844
00:51:57,917 --> 00:52:00,417
How much is he paying
for the damn shirt?

845
00:52:00,862 --> 00:52:01,862
Alfredo...

846
00:52:02,501 --> 00:52:03,417
How much?

847
00:52:03,501 --> 00:52:04,417
50.

848
00:52:04,501 --> 00:52:07,001
€50,000 for a shirt?

849
00:52:08,376 --> 00:52:09,167
Well.

850
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:11,334
Let's get someone
to send you up some clothes.

851
00:52:28,167 --> 00:52:29,459
Is your first time to Paris?

852
00:52:29,542 --> 00:52:32,167
No, I lived here for 2 years.

853
00:52:34,409 --> 00:52:39,334
Please, tell me anything, anything I might do
to make your trip more enjoyable.

854
00:52:39,834 --> 00:52:43,001
Something you want to talk about,
something you want to know?

855
00:52:44,751 --> 00:52:46,459
I have special gift.

856
00:52:47,167 --> 00:52:48,751
I can read your future.

857
00:52:50,001 --> 00:52:51,326
- While you're driving?
- Yeah.

858
00:52:52,376 --> 00:52:55,626
Some people read the future
in tea leaves,

859
00:52:55,751 --> 00:52:58,001
I read the future in traffic.

860
00:53:02,167 --> 00:53:03,501
What do you see?

861
00:53:07,709 --> 00:53:10,667
Right now,
I see a trouble past.

862
00:53:19,834 --> 00:53:22,626
Two years ago,
I really messed up my life.

863
00:53:22,751 --> 00:53:25,676
And now, I'm with a man
who's really nice.

864
00:53:25,936 --> 00:53:26,936
I mean...

865
00:53:27,501 --> 00:53:29,917
To be honest, I don't even think
it could get better.

866
00:53:30,167 --> 00:53:31,501
He is creative,

867
00:53:31,626 --> 00:53:32,917
and he is handsome,

868
00:53:33,084 --> 00:53:34,834
and he is gentle...

869
00:53:35,417 --> 00:53:38,292
He's planting flowers
all over Paris.

870
00:53:38,417 --> 00:53:40,667
And now he is moving here for me.

871
00:53:42,167 --> 00:53:43,876
I got a lot of traffic here.

872
00:53:44,042 --> 00:53:44,834
And what does that mean?

873
00:53:48,584 --> 00:53:49,917
There is someone else.

874
00:53:50,084 --> 00:53:51,667
No,
there's no one.

875
00:53:51,876 --> 00:53:53,584
Traffic doesn't lie.

876
00:53:55,842 --> 00:53:59,251
So, all you've done with this
young woman is share a kiss?

877
00:53:59,376 --> 00:54:01,917
I agree doesn't sound like much,
but...

878
00:54:02,834 --> 00:54:04,501
I can't stop thinking about her.

879
00:54:06,084 --> 00:54:06,917
You're in love.

880
00:54:08,209 --> 00:54:10,917
Yes,
I guess I'm in love.

881
00:54:11,917 --> 00:54:13,334
Why did you divorce Alfredo?

882
00:54:13,784 --> 00:54:16,376
The question should be
"Why did I ever marry him?"

883
00:54:16,751 --> 00:54:17,951
Why did you ever marry him?

884
00:54:20,417 --> 00:54:22,376
He was very handsome,
exciting,

885
00:54:22,751 --> 00:54:23,667
charming,

886
00:54:23,792 --> 00:54:25,542
powerful, rich...

887
00:54:26,834 --> 00:54:28,667
Suave and dangerous.

888
00:54:29,126 --> 00:54:31,209
Italian men can be very strange.

889
00:54:31,334 --> 00:54:32,251
Then he changed?

890
00:54:32,876 --> 00:54:33,834
Not at all.

891
00:54:34,417 --> 00:54:35,584
That's why I divorced him.

892
00:54:39,968 --> 00:54:40,768
Here!

893
00:54:44,501 --> 00:54:46,376
I love this place.

894
00:54:53,292 --> 00:54:55,364
It moves me
how those coins represent

895
00:54:55,367 --> 00:54:57,711
the wishes and dreams of
hundreds of people.

896
00:54:59,167 --> 00:55:00,209
I love that.

897
00:55:02,876 --> 00:55:05,251
A constellation of
hopes and dreams.

898
00:55:09,376 --> 00:55:10,751
Okay, make a wish.

899
00:55:14,501 --> 00:55:16,084
I wish for money.

900
00:55:16,917 --> 00:55:19,709
Throwing away money seems
very counter-productive.

901
00:55:21,438 --> 00:55:22,238
Okay.

902
00:55:25,788 --> 00:55:26,788
- Yes!
- Huh, huh.

903
00:55:27,459 --> 00:55:28,501
OK, my turn.

904
00:55:29,792 --> 00:55:32,459
I wish...
Thomas Grégoire could forgive me.

905
00:55:34,042 --> 00:55:35,042
Who's that?

906
00:55:35,459 --> 00:55:36,792
Thomas Grégoire.

907
00:55:38,459 --> 00:55:40,501
He was the love of my life,

908
00:55:40,584 --> 00:55:42,334
a long, long time ago.

909
00:55:42,792 --> 00:55:46,001
Even now, not one day passes by
that I don't think of him.

910
00:55:46,167 --> 00:55:47,251
What happened?

911
00:55:47,376 --> 00:55:48,876
I became famous.

912
00:55:49,501 --> 00:55:50,834
I had an affair.

913
00:55:53,001 --> 00:55:55,001
He found out in the newspapers.

914
00:55:56,209 --> 00:55:57,648
It was on the front page of

915
00:55:57,651 --> 00:56:00,461
every single newspapers
on the planet.

916
00:56:07,792 --> 00:56:11,292
And the reconciliation
has to be just as spectacular.

917
00:59:09,001 --> 00:59:10,501
- What's your name?
- What?

918
00:59:10,626 --> 00:59:11,459
What's your name?

919
00:59:11,542 --> 00:59:12,209
Aja!

920
00:59:12,334 --> 00:59:14,167
Ajatashatru Lavash Patel.

921
00:59:14,376 --> 00:59:15,792
Are you and Nelly together?

922
00:59:17,051 --> 00:59:20,001
No. She's in love with
the finest man in the world,

923
00:59:20,126 --> 00:59:21,542
Thomas Grégoire.

924
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
「I Love you,
Thomas Grégoire」

925
00:59:31,792 --> 00:59:33,084
I want that shirt!

926
00:59:33,209 --> 00:59:34,209
No, Alfredo.

927
00:59:34,334 --> 00:59:36,084
You don't appreciate art.

928
00:59:36,209 --> 00:59:37,819
How can you say
I don't appreciate art?

929
00:59:37,822 --> 00:59:38,836
I appreciate art!

930
00:59:49,876 --> 00:59:51,459
We promised Giancarlo.

931
00:59:56,167 --> 00:59:57,192
Why Giancarlo?

932
00:59:57,217 --> 01:00:00,051
Why always Giancarlo!?
Why Giancarlo?

933
01:00:06,792 --> 01:00:08,459
So, how much are you offering?

934
01:00:09,792 --> 01:00:11,376
€100,000.

935
01:00:17,667 --> 01:00:18,467
Cash.

936
01:00:55,334 --> 01:00:57,126
<i>Thomas Grégoire.</i>

937
01:01:27,161 --> 01:01:28,161
- Hi.
- Hi.

938
01:01:35,926 --> 01:01:37,176
He called.

939
01:01:37,542 --> 01:01:38,917
Thomas called.

940
01:02:12,709 --> 01:02:13,626
How's everything?

941
01:02:13,792 --> 01:02:14,834
Very good.

942
01:02:15,292 --> 01:02:15,917
Very good.

943
01:02:17,126 --> 01:02:18,792
I heard Nelly's in town.

944
01:02:20,501 --> 01:02:21,251
"You heard"?

945
01:02:21,376 --> 01:02:24,417
Huh, maybe,
we could all have a drink?

946
01:02:24,542 --> 01:02:26,042
Of course, of course.

947
01:02:26,167 --> 01:02:27,042
Please call me...

948
01:02:28,376 --> 01:02:29,292
or Nelly.

949
01:02:30,667 --> 01:02:31,417
You... you...

950
01:02:32,042 --> 01:02:32,901
talked to her sometime?

951
01:02:33,184 --> 01:02:34,876
I mean,
you called her?

952
01:02:35,292 --> 01:02:36,167
Nelly?

953
01:02:37,251 --> 01:02:37,917
No.

954
01:02:48,834 --> 01:02:50,542
I'm sorry for the shirt.

955
01:02:53,501 --> 01:02:54,501
What shirt?

956
01:02:55,001 --> 01:02:56,542
The shirt-story.

957
01:02:57,709 --> 01:02:59,001
I bought the shirt.

958
01:02:59,126 --> 01:03:01,751
What the hell
are you talking about?

959
01:03:03,084 --> 01:03:04,042
I have to go.

960
01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:07,060
Alfredo.

961
01:03:27,417 --> 01:03:28,209
Give me back the money.

962
01:03:29,751 --> 01:03:31,126
I said,
"Give me back the money!"

963
01:03:31,637 --> 01:03:33,237
Okay, okay.

964
01:04:18,501 --> 01:04:20,917
Moohini,
where do I go?

965
01:05:12,003 --> 01:05:13,936
- Hey, svelto (careful).
- Ciao, Francisco.

966
01:05:16,667 --> 01:05:18,209
<i>I flewed (flew) over Rome,</i>

967
01:05:18,417 --> 01:05:19,751
<i>towards Paris.</i>

968
01:05:20,667 --> 01:05:22,501
<i>I even had provisions.</i>

969
01:05:37,540 --> 01:05:38,900
<i>I had time to dream</i>

970
01:05:38,905 --> 01:05:42,942
<i>about the terrific life that I would have
with the money I had earned.</i>

971
01:05:43,251 --> 01:05:45,001
<i>Life was good.</i>

972
01:05:58,001 --> 01:06:00,459
I traveled for hours and hours.

973
01:06:00,834 --> 01:06:02,626
It was beautiful.

974
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:05,667
The winds seemed to be perfect.

975
01:06:14,501 --> 01:06:16,876
I am a rich man!

976
01:06:40,001 --> 01:06:41,542
I am a rich man...

977
01:06:43,209 --> 01:06:44,917
and I am about to die.

978
01:07:49,001 --> 01:07:52,709
Hello, this is the
Indian Secretary of Commerce.

979
01:07:53,209 --> 01:07:54,584
I need to talk to Marie.

980
01:07:54,709 --> 01:07:57,167
- <i> She is not in today, sir.</i>
- <i> It's an emergency.</i>

981
01:08:07,101 --> 01:08:07,901
Hello.

982
01:08:08,309 --> 01:08:09,109
Marie?

983
01:08:09,176 --> 01:08:10,426
Marie's in a shower.

984
01:08:10,792 --> 01:08:11,792
This is Ajatashatru.

985
01:08:12,292 --> 01:08:14,317
You stood her up at the Eiffel Tower.

986
01:08:14,351 --> 01:08:15,351
No...

987
01:08:16,834 --> 01:08:19,251
Yes, but...
Can I leave a message?

988
01:08:20,734 --> 01:08:21,734
- Eh, yeah.
- Okay.

989
01:08:23,917 --> 01:08:27,459
I'm very, very sorry for
missing our date for the Tower.

990
01:08:28,792 --> 01:08:31,876
Extraordinary circumstances
made things difficult.

991
01:08:32,042 --> 01:08:34,709
<i>I think,
I may never be able to call her.</i>

992
01:08:34,876 --> 01:08:36,001
Ever.

993
01:08:37,501 --> 01:08:39,584
I know we met only once...

994
01:08:40,251 --> 01:08:42,209
but our kiss was inspiring.

995
01:08:43,542 --> 01:08:44,917
<i>Please tell her...</i>

996
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:50,585
Is she able to travel?

997
01:08:50,588 --> 01:08:52,203
- Uh, no.
- Okay.

998
01:08:54,292 --> 01:08:57,584
Please tell her if she
never hears again from me...

999
01:09:00,376 --> 01:09:01,292
that...

1000
01:09:02,501 --> 01:09:03,334
that I love him.

1001
01:09:04,436 --> 01:09:05,236
<i>Yes.</i>

1002
01:09:05,376 --> 01:09:08,292
I will always, always,
always love her.

1003
01:09:08,417 --> 01:09:09,417
I love her!

1004
01:09:09,501 --> 01:09:10,542
She met someone else.

1005
01:09:11,584 --> 01:09:15,042
<i>And yesterday, they decided
to move in together.</i>

1006
01:09:17,126 --> 01:09:18,626
Can I change my message?

1007
01:09:18,917 --> 01:09:19,876
Sure.

1008
01:09:22,709 --> 01:09:23,834
No message.

1009
01:09:47,501 --> 01:09:49,126
<i>Aja, your life is a mess.</i>

1010
01:09:49,251 --> 01:09:52,251
<i>You need to sort yourself
and hurry back to Paris!</i>

1011
01:09:52,376 --> 01:09:54,126
<i>Listen to your mother, for once.</i>

1012
01:09:54,251 --> 01:09:55,417
I know.

1013
01:09:56,834 --> 01:09:59,167
Just when my life seems
to be getting back on track,

1014
01:10:01,792 --> 01:10:04,501
just when I get some money

1015
01:10:04,584 --> 01:10:07,709
that might
help me live a decent life,

1016
01:10:09,501 --> 01:10:12,834
just when
love seems to be possible...

1017
01:10:14,501 --> 01:10:17,251
I am doomed to die an awful death.

1018
01:10:18,501 --> 01:10:19,826
What kind of karma is that?

1019
01:10:19,851 --> 01:10:23,392
<i>Stop blaming your karma,
and take responsibility for your life!</i>

1020
01:10:23,917 --> 01:10:24,876
What do you mean?

1021
01:10:25,042 --> 01:10:27,459
<i>You are in control of your life,</i>

1022
01:10:27,584 --> 01:10:29,584
<i>not chance, or karma.</i>

1023
01:10:58,042 --> 01:10:59,584
Now, tell me.

1024
01:11:00,501 --> 01:11:02,251
What is in the briefcase?

1025
01:11:03,834 --> 01:11:05,001
It's a long story.

1026
01:11:05,126 --> 01:11:06,626
I have all the time.

1027
01:11:06,834 --> 01:11:08,542
I'm just trying to get to Paris.

1028
01:11:08,669 --> 01:11:09,469
Paris.

1029
01:11:12,292 --> 01:11:14,751
You won't be there anytime soon.

1030
01:11:15,459 --> 01:11:16,584
We are going to Libya.

1031
01:11:17,210 --> 01:11:18,910
- Libya!?
- Yes.

1032
01:11:21,126 --> 01:11:25,501
And, what so precious in that briefcase
that you won't let it go?

1033
01:11:26,542 --> 01:11:28,126
It's just some...

1034
01:11:28,417 --> 01:11:29,251
some of...

1035
01:11:30,209 --> 01:11:31,292
personal necessities.

1036
01:11:34,626 --> 01:11:35,501
Of course.

1037
01:11:36,626 --> 01:11:37,501
Open it.

1038
01:11:38,334 --> 01:11:39,167
Why? It's just some...

1039
01:11:40,251 --> 01:11:41,751
Open the briefcase.

1040
01:11:41,876 --> 01:11:42,917
What's with all the guns!

1041
01:11:43,250 --> 01:11:44,250
Indian,

1042
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:45,800
open the briefcase!

1043
01:11:46,761 --> 01:11:47,561
Okay.

1044
01:11:54,417 --> 01:11:56,334
<i>At that very moment,</i>

1045
01:11:56,751 --> 01:11:59,417
<i>I summoned
all my magical powers</i>

1046
01:11:59,501 --> 01:12:01,501
<i>to make the money
invisible.</i>

1047
01:12:02,876 --> 01:12:04,667
Open the briefcase!

1048
01:12:30,167 --> 01:12:34,834
<i>Libya had become the place that
it seemed all refugees ended up</i>

1049
01:12:35,001 --> 01:12:37,042
<i>at one point or another.</i>

1050
01:12:39,113 --> 01:12:39,913
Aja.

1051
01:12:41,028 --> 01:12:41,828
Aja!

1052
01:12:45,792 --> 01:12:47,292
What are you doing in Africa, man?

1053
01:12:48,042 --> 01:12:48,917
What are you doing here?

1054
01:12:49,126 --> 01:12:51,626
Unfortunately, they don't want me
in the land of the milk and honey.

1055
01:12:53,334 --> 01:12:54,501
But I want to thank you.

1056
01:12:57,126 --> 01:12:58,542
I need your help.

1057
01:12:58,667 --> 01:13:01,542
There were several
clandestine refugee camps.

1058
01:13:01,667 --> 01:13:03,501
All people in transit.

1059
01:13:05,792 --> 01:13:07,334
I knew where the money was.

1060
01:13:07,709 --> 01:13:11,917
<i>So I asked Wiraj if they could
help me get my briefcase back.</i>

1061
01:13:12,667 --> 01:13:13,917
<i>That was my money.</i>

1062
01:13:14,626 --> 01:13:16,042
<i>I had earned it.</i>

1063
01:13:16,334 --> 01:13:18,876
<i>There was no way
I would left the thief</i>

1064
01:13:19,042 --> 01:13:20,501
<i>steal my earnings.</i>

1065
01:13:20,834 --> 01:13:22,667
I know exactly where my money is.

1066
01:13:23,501 --> 01:13:26,917
OK, but everyone,
no violence.

1067
01:13:28,292 --> 01:13:29,542
Understood?

1068
01:13:29,667 --> 01:13:32,459
Faysal,
no violence.

1069
01:13:35,834 --> 01:13:37,042
Thank you.

1070
01:13:37,167 --> 01:13:38,501
Thank you very much.

1071
01:13:53,792 --> 01:13:56,209
I want to go back to my wife.

1072
01:13:56,334 --> 01:13:58,834
How does someone
as ugly as you get a wife?

1073
01:13:59,167 --> 01:14:01,376
She doesn't care about the looks.

1074
01:14:02,292 --> 01:14:06,001
The hippo,
is as pretty as the gazelle,

1075
01:14:06,126 --> 01:14:08,251
in the eyes of his wife.

1076
01:14:26,459 --> 01:14:29,126
You can tell he's scared.
Raise it!

1077
01:14:31,334 --> 01:14:33,251
This moron thinks he can bluff me!

1078
01:14:34,459 --> 01:14:38,667
Shut up and put the money on the table!
The money!

1079
01:14:45,751 --> 01:14:46,709
Look at this!

1080
01:15:25,501 --> 01:15:26,667
What are you doing?

1081
01:15:30,042 --> 01:15:31,251
- Too violent?
- Yes.

1082
01:15:31,834 --> 01:15:32,584
Sorry.

1083
01:15:32,601 --> 01:15:34,042
Good evening, Aja.

1084
01:15:34,584 --> 01:15:35,792
Unfortunately,

1085
01:15:35,917 --> 01:15:39,917
tonight I'm in a very,
very bad mood.

1086
01:15:43,751 --> 01:15:45,084
Perfect. Let's go.

1087
01:15:56,209 --> 01:15:57,501
So,

1088
01:15:58,292 --> 01:16:01,084
how much do I owe you,
and others?

1089
01:16:03,751 --> 01:16:05,126
How much is in the briefcase?

1090
01:16:10,042 --> 01:16:12,092
- €2,000.
- €2,000!?

1091
01:16:14,834 --> 01:16:18,209
Well, as you know,
we're all in transit.

1092
01:16:19,376 --> 01:16:20,751
Many are running from the war?

1093
01:16:20,861 --> 01:16:21,661
Okay...

1094
01:16:23,334 --> 01:16:24,084
How much?

1095
01:16:25,459 --> 01:16:30,251
Whitman, lost his wife,
two years ago, in Mali.

1096
01:16:30,534 --> 01:16:31,334
Okay...

1097
01:16:32,209 --> 01:16:33,167
How much?

1098
01:16:34,376 --> 01:16:36,167
This side, Aziz,

1099
01:16:37,167 --> 01:16:40,251
must get to Germany
to find his twin brother.

1100
01:16:40,718 --> 01:16:41,518
Okay...

1101
01:16:42,667 --> 01:16:44,084
So, how...
How much?

1102
01:16:44,501 --> 01:16:45,709
Emel, there,
Emel.

1103
01:16:46,209 --> 01:16:49,251
She was attacked by soldiers
during the war.

1104
01:16:49,376 --> 01:16:51,501
A friend of her is in Brussels
owns bakery.

1105
01:16:51,584 --> 01:16:55,126
So she has a job waiting for her
only if she can get there.

1106
01:17:00,084 --> 01:17:01,834
Everyone of them has a dream.

1107
01:17:03,334 --> 01:17:04,501
I understand.

1108
01:17:06,334 --> 01:17:08,709
Give... what feels right.

1109
01:17:25,667 --> 01:17:29,001
A few of my brothers and sisters
helped me last night.

1110
01:17:30,292 --> 01:17:32,917
Anyone with a hope or a dream,

1111
01:17:34,376 --> 01:17:36,042
please stand in line.

1112
01:17:37,501 --> 01:17:39,542
I may be able to help you.

1113
01:17:45,167 --> 01:17:46,376
What is your wish?

1114
01:17:47,084 --> 01:17:48,167
To have a boat...

1115
01:17:49,501 --> 01:17:51,084
so I can go fish

1116
01:17:51,209 --> 01:17:52,126
at the sea to...

1117
01:17:52,292 --> 01:17:54,834
to earn money
for my family.

1118
01:17:55,917 --> 01:17:57,917
That seems very reasonable.

1119
01:18:06,292 --> 01:18:07,292
Buy your boat.

1120
01:18:08,334 --> 01:18:09,626
Feed your family.

1121
01:18:19,376 --> 01:18:20,501
Look!

1122
01:18:24,542 --> 01:18:25,709
Tell me.

1123
01:18:26,542 --> 01:18:29,834
I need a plane ticket
to Brussels.

1124
01:18:30,167 --> 01:18:32,084
I want to learn
how to make chocolate.

1125
01:18:38,037 --> 01:18:39,037
There you go.

1126
01:18:42,763 --> 01:18:43,763
Thank you.

1127
01:18:44,417 --> 01:18:45,659
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

1128
01:18:50,834 --> 01:18:52,459
<i>And then, it happened.</i>

1129
01:18:53,459 --> 01:18:55,126
<i>I couldn't stop.</i>

1130
01:18:55,251 --> 01:18:57,876
<i>I was overcome by
a feeling of well-being,</i>

1131
01:18:58,042 --> 01:19:01,251
<i>as if a lady in the clear vapor cloud</i>

1132
01:19:01,376 --> 01:19:03,251
<i>had appeared inside my chest</i>

1133
01:19:03,376 --> 01:19:05,584
<i>and was spreading
throughout my body.</i>

1134
01:19:06,501 --> 01:19:08,751
In front of all these refugees,

1135
01:19:09,751 --> 01:19:13,417
I succeeded in creating
my greatest magic trick, ever.

1136
01:19:13,876 --> 01:19:15,501
How is that?

1137
01:19:15,626 --> 01:19:19,917
I transformed €2,000 into
a never ending flow of money.

1138
01:19:20,084 --> 01:19:21,709
People went back to their villages,

1139
01:19:21,834 --> 01:19:26,709
and everyone told the story of
Ajatashatru Lavash Patel.

1140
01:19:44,709 --> 01:19:48,376
<i>Right then, I understood
what I really wanted.</i>

1141
01:19:48,501 --> 01:19:50,834
I wanted to
come home to India.

1142
01:19:52,251 --> 01:19:55,042
I had just enough money
to buy my plane ticket

1143
01:19:55,167 --> 01:19:57,417
and a real fake passport.

1144
01:19:59,767 --> 01:20:03,459
<i>But first, I had
one last important thing to do.</i>

1145
01:20:04,042 --> 01:20:05,542
It's nice meeting you Aja.

1146
01:20:06,376 --> 01:20:07,792
Likewise.
Take care, man.

1147
01:20:09,126 --> 01:20:10,209
Safe trip.

1148
01:20:33,376 --> 01:20:34,459
Go, quick!

1149
01:20:37,417 --> 01:20:38,667
My money!

1150
01:21:16,084 --> 01:21:17,584
Honey, I'm sorry.

1151
01:21:17,792 --> 01:21:20,542
I'm late.
Traffic was terrible.

1152
01:21:26,709 --> 01:21:29,042
God damn-it,
I slaved away all day at work,

1153
01:21:29,167 --> 01:21:31,667
is it really too much
to ask for dinner to be ready?

1154
01:21:41,209 --> 01:21:42,792
It's lovely to see you.

1155
01:21:45,584 --> 01:21:47,459
It's lovely to see you too.

1156
01:21:49,126 --> 01:21:49,876
Marie,

1157
01:21:50,126 --> 01:21:51,542
I found the deck chair.

1158
01:21:51,667 --> 01:21:52,542
Oh, great.

1159
01:21:53,917 --> 01:21:56,717
Pieter, this is Aja.
Aja, this is Pieter.

1160
01:21:57,667 --> 01:21:58,376
Hi.

1161
01:22:01,918 --> 01:22:02,718
Hi.

1162
01:22:05,292 --> 01:22:06,376
I'll see you soon.

1163
01:22:07,352 --> 01:22:08,152
Yeah.

1164
01:22:31,334 --> 01:22:32,417
€54, please.

1165
01:22:32,501 --> 01:22:34,542
<i>This is a good deal
for a fabulous mother.</i>

1166
01:22:36,587 --> 01:22:37,587
Thank you.

1167
01:22:49,251 --> 01:22:51,626
<i>Only after this very difficult journey</i>

1168
01:22:51,751 --> 01:22:54,542
<i>that I realized
what I wanted in life.</i>

1169
01:22:54,667 --> 01:22:55,834
Moohini!

1170
01:22:57,084 --> 01:22:58,501
You're still here.

1171
01:22:58,626 --> 01:22:59,892
How are you?
Wait...

1172
01:23:06,251 --> 01:23:07,709
Welcome home, Aja.

1173
01:23:07,834 --> 01:23:11,126
<i>Eventually, I succeeding in
reaching a deal with Giri</i>

1174
01:23:11,251 --> 01:23:14,501
<i>to pay back the money he believed
I still owed him.</i>

1175
01:23:17,626 --> 01:23:20,501
<i>Then I started teaching.</i>

1176
01:23:22,751 --> 01:23:24,709
<i>Each morning, these kids show up</i>

1177
01:23:24,834 --> 01:23:27,001
<i>and I tell them stories.</i>

1178
01:23:28,251 --> 01:23:32,209
<i>And I make sure
their world becomes a bit bigger</i>

1179
01:23:32,334 --> 01:23:35,459
<i>and they understand
they are not poor.</i>

1180
01:23:35,542 --> 01:23:38,501
The great poet
Rabindranath Tagore writes,

1181
01:23:39,084 --> 01:23:43,959
"How can you cross the sea
by merely standing and staring at it?"

1182
01:23:44,863 --> 01:23:45,663
What...

1183
01:23:57,169 --> 01:23:57,969
Well...

1184
01:23:59,084 --> 01:24:02,442
You boys, just think
what he means by that.

1185
01:24:02,467 --> 01:24:03,267
I'm sorry.

1186
01:24:04,312 --> 01:24:05,511
- I'm disturbing you.
- No, no.

1187
01:24:13,459 --> 01:24:15,167
I did promise.

1188
01:24:24,684 --> 01:24:26,809
Did you leave your fiancé
at the altar again?

1189
01:24:35,084 --> 01:24:37,417
Maybe I shouldn't have come.

1190
01:24:48,459 --> 01:24:50,167
Go back to your seats.
Now!

1191
01:24:50,554 --> 01:24:51,354
Go!

1192
01:24:53,167 --> 01:24:55,542
And that
is the end of the story.

1193
01:24:56,042 --> 01:24:57,292
Any questions?

1194
01:24:59,126 --> 01:25:00,417
What's a lesbian?

1195
01:25:04,917 --> 01:25:06,501
Someone who loves a woman.

1196
01:25:07,251 --> 01:25:08,542
So I can be a lesbian?

1197
01:25:11,037 --> 01:25:11,837
Well...

1198
01:25:13,917 --> 01:25:14,917
Yes.

1199
01:25:15,542 --> 01:25:18,626
Why did you say at the beginning
that this story was a tragedy?

1200
01:25:24,876 --> 01:25:27,292
You're going to prison
for four years.

1201
01:25:28,501 --> 01:25:31,292
That...
is a terrible tragedy.

1202
01:25:33,834 --> 01:25:37,542
You are going to lose
four of the best years of your life.

1203
01:25:42,501 --> 01:25:43,209
Unless...

1204
01:25:46,001 --> 01:25:48,251
you seize this opportunity.

1205
01:25:48,501 --> 01:25:49,584
What opportunity?

1206
01:25:56,917 --> 01:25:59,501
If you come to my
school every day,

1207
01:26:00,167 --> 01:26:01,709
you don't have to go to prison.

1208
01:26:03,917 --> 01:26:04,584
Really?

1209
01:26:05,459 --> 01:26:06,126
Really.

1210
01:26:06,319 --> 01:26:07,719
- Yes!
- Yes?

1211
01:26:08,269 --> 01:26:09,269
- Yes.
- Yes?

1212
01:26:10,180 --> 01:26:11,180
Yeah.

1213
01:26:12,292 --> 01:26:13,126
Every day.

1214
01:26:13,251 --> 01:26:14,334
- Every day.
- Every day.

1215
01:26:14,621 --> 01:26:15,421
Every day.

1216
01:26:15,971 --> 01:26:16,971
Every day.

1217
01:26:17,167 --> 01:26:18,376
Thank you, Aja.

1218
01:26:22,419 --> 01:26:23,219
Aja,

1219
01:26:23,917 --> 01:26:25,001
what about your mother?

1220
01:26:25,709 --> 01:26:27,584
Thank you so much for asking.

1221
01:26:30,584 --> 01:26:33,126
My mother is where
she always wanted to be.

1222
01:28:00,751 --> 01:28:02,542
Was that a true story?

1223
01:28:05,084 --> 01:28:07,209
Only the important parts.
