00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:49,026

- Is Sister-in-law there?
- Just a minute.

- What colour sari are you wearing?

14
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:02,973
- Red coloured one!
- I too am going to wearing that.

15
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:04,707
That wouldn't look nice on you.

16
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:07,217
Wear the mango coloured sari.
That will suit you.

17
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,579
- Ok, dear.
- Is Vairam brother there?

18
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:12,722
- Brother!
- Tell me, Sudha.

19
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:15,225
Brother! Where shall we have
our food? -In Hamsavalli!

20
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,818
We had it there last year.

21
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:20,161
Younger brother bought us mutton dosai
when we went for a film, is it that?

22
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:21,096
Which shop is that?

23
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:25,863
- Brother! -Tell me.
- Didn't you buy them mutton dosai?

24
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:28,167
- Konar mess!
- We will have it there.

25
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:31,300
- Ok! -Give the phone to Saroja!
- Wait a minute.

26
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:34,409
- Saroja!
- Tell me.

27
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,242
- My sister wants to..
- Give me.

28
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,116
You look nice in this sari!

29
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:44,520
- Give it.
- Here. Talk.

30
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:46,054
Tell me Sudha.

31
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,059
What colour sari are you wearing?

32
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,925
Pink color. -Change it.
I too am going to wear that colour.

33
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:53,628
- I will change it.
- Ok.

34
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,028
Give it to Geetha.

35
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:59,030
- What did she say?
- Your sister didn't like this color.

36
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:00,229
- Wait.
- What is it?

37
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,932
Your back does not look nice.

38
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:03,040
Damn you.

39
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:07,213
Tell dear. -What colour sari
are you going to wear?

40
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:10,472
I wanted to wear green colour sari

41
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:12,275
I went for a marriage the day before.

42
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:14,717
All were wearing the peacock
green colour sari!

43
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:17,014
It looked horrible!

44
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,159
I am thinking of wearing
the parrot green color

45
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:24,126
I too have the same colour sari with me.

46
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:26,424
You too mention exactly the same.

47
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:28,796
You can wear the same colour sari

48
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:31,003
I will wear the peacock
green coloured sari

49
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:34,138
I wonder how you
have changed the color

50
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,903
I am from the Nala kottai
people lineage! Mind you!

51
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:39,009
Aren't you ready yet?

52
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:40,872
We are getting ready.

53
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:42,411
Sudha! Tell me.

54
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:44,642
Brother! A latest 3 layer
ear ring has come!

55
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:47,219
I wanted to buy that.
Not 3 layer! I can buy you 4 layer!

56
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,289
They are pampering her so much!

57
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,948
I pity Baskar!

58
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:55,019
You should call him innocent brother!

59
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:57,958
He has married without
knowing the consequences!

60
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,031
I wonder how much is he suffering!

61
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:01,824
I have pressed your
dress in the morning!

62
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:03,731
But you are wearing the uniform!

63
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:07,965
So, don't you want
to go for the first Deepavali?

64
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:09,903
You're going to insult my family and..

65
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:12,773
Eat with the prisoners!
Isn't it?

66
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,073
I am talking to you only.

67
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:19,314
We will have mutton dosai at
lunch from Konar mess.

68
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,511
Enough? The phone is ringing!
Go and talk.

69
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,756
Make a list of things you want.

70
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,314
Why did you hit there?

71
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:54,886
SUB JAIL Sir has come.

72
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:00,786
- Sir!
- What?

73
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:03,418
He has hit the ball inside.
Can you take it and give us?

74
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:04,553
It has become a routine for you!

75
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:06,494
There is a function.
I can't take the ball.

76
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:07,597
Buy another ball!

77
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:09,326
All we had was the only one.

78
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:15,663
- Here it is.
- No thanks, sir.

79
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,638
Take Buy another ball.

80
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:20,845
Don't play here.
Go somewhere and play

81
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:28,481
I was like the boys!
I had not any worries!

82
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:32,184
I was born and brought up in
a village called Sevvankudi!

83
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,559
There were forests around the place.

84
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:39,821
There was cool breeze which carried
the voice of my dead mother!

85
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:56,040
I too went to school along with the boys

86
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:25,207
I took everything playfully in that age.

87
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,913
- What is this?
- Ball, sir!

88
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:31,276
I know that. Are you playing
instead of going to the class?

89
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:34,682
I came to this school 3 months ago.

90
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:36,152
But I have not seen you so far.

91
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:39,053
He is making a fool of his dad
without going to class.

92
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:41,653
Are you making your dad a fool?

93
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:45,595
Disobeying dad is not good for a son.
Where is your house?

94
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:48,963
If my dad finds out
he will take the ears off!

95
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:51,229
If you do anything wrong
anyone would do that.

96
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:55,567
He has fooled me without going
to school for 3 months.

97
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:59,539
You didn't inform this to me!
What teacher you are?

98
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:02,941
How much you have in your pocket?

99
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:09,615
1.. 2.. 30 rupees!

100
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:13,021
This is the penalty as my son
hasn't gone to school for 3 months.

101
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:16,292
- Please request.
- Go!

102
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:18,863
What is a teacher doing while
we're playing cards? Go.

103
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:22,059
Cards please.

104
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:25,194
His job is to rob things
from others being a dad!

105
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:30,131
He warned that the ears will get hurt.

106
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:34,939
Disobeying the student
is not good for a teacher.

107
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,808
- You...!
- Are you hitting me?

108
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:38,906
I'll tell to my dad!

109
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:51,989
You haven't gone to school
for 3 months, right?

110
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:54,165
I can't understand what he teaches!

111
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:56,167
You could earn money only if you study!

112
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:59,669
Can we earn only if we study?
Can't we earn money by doing work?

113
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:02,167
Do you want to enjoy life
with his earnings?

114
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:04,175
Aren't you happy with my earnings?

115
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:05,437
Why do you yell like this for that?

116
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,708
I wouldn't be suffering if
I had married a learned man.

117
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:10,577
Have your food and go to sleep!

118
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:13,914
I went for work to avoid
such kind of an insult

119
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:21,290
I am going to drink tea!

120
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:24,021
If anyone gets down from the van,
I'll leave him here and go.

121
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,655
Come. Brother! 2 teas!

122
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:29,731
What is the sound there?

123
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:30,958
Here is the tea!

124
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,865
Why are you roaming
with school students?

125
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:35,566
I'm not doing that
He only hangs around with me.

126
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:39,406
Wait for another 3 months!
Don't dump the things outside.

127
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:40,501
All are watching.

128
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:42,877
Alas! We are suffering like anything.

129
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:46,846
We are in the road because
of my drunkard husband.

130
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:50,889
Where shall we go?
Just wait for 3 months.

131
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:56,594
He has made my daughter
pick things on the road.

132
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:58,391
Cruel guy.

133
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:04,534
Your dad has died due to drinking
by borrowing money from people!

134
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:08,262
I wonder how I am going
to help you out of this.

135
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:14,970
Mom..

136
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:25,424
I met Myna in a situation
like this for the first time.

137
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:35,823
Grandma! You have nobody for you!

138
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:39,395
They too have no one for them.

139
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:41,065
Let them be with you.

140
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,996
Ok! Let them be with me

141
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:48,297
I like this old woman
very much in our place.

142
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:51,774
When any fight happens at home
I used to come here to sleep.

143
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:55,472
She cared Myna much as she cared me.

144
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:59,576
SWEET CAKE -25 Paise
SPICY CAKE -20 Paise.

145
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:01,117
Take it without dropping it.

146
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,381
Should we call you
from sleep to come with us?

147
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,492
You are a good for nothing.

148
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:10,494
Are you going to be a collector?

149
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:13,989
Why are you crying?

150
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:19,001
Son in law! She wants to go
to school. -Why don't you admit her?

151
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:21,573
How can I do that
when I am busy with the work?

152
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,504
Is that all?
You take care of your work.

153
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:26,236
Come Myna!
I told you to come.

154
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:34,314
See you grandma!
Bye mom.

155
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:41,118
Greetings sir.

156
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:46,763
- What is it?
- She is my friend. Admit her sir.

157
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,697
Is it a film hall to come in the middle?

158
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:55,739
Shall I tell my dad?

159
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:05,081
- Go and sit.
- Here it is. Study well.

160
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,217
Mani! Stop the vehicle.

161
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:46,186
You go. I will come later.

162
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,261
Why have you come alone?

163
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:56,231
Had you told me,
I would've plucked and given you.

164
00:13:56,468 --> 00:14:00,529
He came with me and
ran away leaving me.

165
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:03,231
- Brother! -What man?
- She is my friend, leave her.

166
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:08,803
You son of Maayi! Others will scared
if I punish the girl like this.

167
00:14:08,914 --> 00:14:11,883
Is Myna equal to others?

168
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:13,474
You are taking her when I am talking!

169
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,816
Come here.
Go!

170
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:16,946
Barking dogs seldom bite.

171
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:19,456
Why is it so?
Bite him.

172
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:21,685
- You come here.
- You bite him.

173
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:30,597

Am I a doctor?

00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:47,865
You won't understand it now.

243
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:50,441
You will know when they put
you in the middle of the road.

244
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,089
Why do you take her in a short cut?

245
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:08,250
If I go in your route,
the school bell will ring!

246
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:10,361
That's why.
Let's go.

247
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,558
Don't take advantage on her.

248
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:17,127
They have sent you with her
having faith in you.

249
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:19,303
If I were called being the panchayat
chief I wouldn't be able to come.

250
00:22:19,304 --> 00:22:21,001
Because I am very busy now

251
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:22,539
I will slipper you...!

252
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:24,131
I won't be able to come
even if you slipper me.

253
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:26,904
- Let us meet after the evening.
- That means at night!

254
00:22:56,942 --> 00:22:59,342
What are you doing to me?
Let me down.

255
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:00,743
We have come.

256
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,538
Stop it! Where are you go?

257
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:07,612
- What dear?
- Go and see her.

258
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,047
You brought the
old woman without asking.

259
00:23:10,455 --> 00:23:11,581
The girl said she had a bad stomach.

260
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:12,654
That's why I have brought her.

261
00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:14,215
You are talking
as if she is your grandma.

262
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:16,385
- Go man.
- All the men can go away.

263
00:23:40,152 --> 00:23:41,585
She has attained puberty.

264
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,685
Don't be with her for 10 to 15 days.

265
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:09,644
What if Myna doesn't have
her maternal uncle?

266
00:24:09,815 --> 00:24:11,180
Skull Manickam is there, isn't it?

267
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:14,914
Why do you stare at me?
Can't I do the customs?

268
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:22,292
Both of us can do it together.

269
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:23,361
Get away man.

270
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:25,563
Suruli! You have bought
this chappals only now

271
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:27,157
I will hit you!

272
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:31,827
I am not scared of hits.
This chappal too is gone!

273
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:40,044
Sister! How much will it cost?

274
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,204
About 20 to 25 thousand rupees.

275
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:43,039
Aunt has told that nobody should
talk to her or see her

276
00:25:45,443 --> 00:25:46,808
I told you to go from here.

277
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:54,947
Sister! It is your turn.

278
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:29,384
Go man.
I will bow down before you!

279
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:32,320
Ok. Don't beg.
Maintain your dignity.

280
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:46,028
What is this?
It costs 5250 Rupees!

281
00:26:46,137 --> 00:26:49,072
Don't see the price.
Give it.

282
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:46,795
You look like a princess!

283
00:27:46,898 --> 00:27:49,162
Don't know which prince
will come to marry you

284
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:50,590
God bless you!

285
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,010
Stop! I told you to stop.

286
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:13,283
You have to watch it,
get the fruit and return back.

287
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:17,051
Don't you know?
Don't you know that..

288
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:20,325
We were friends since our childhood?

289
00:28:20,498 --> 00:28:22,693
How can a prince like man
could take her off?

290
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:26,994
- Tell me now. Who will take her off?
- It is you.

291
00:28:27,238 --> 00:28:29,502
- Loudly!
- It is you.

292
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,772
- Tell the name.
- Suruli.

293
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:37,314
King Suruli only will marry her.
Tell that.

294
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:40,074
- King Suruli only will marry her.
- Tell with a smile.

295
00:28:40,351 --> 00:28:43,149
- King Suruli only will marry her.
- Tell with a smile.

296
00:28:43,254 --> 00:28:45,188
King Suruli only will marry her.

297
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:46,723
You and your hair do Go!

298
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:48,859
Tell it and go.
Tell it.

299
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,757
King Suruli only will marry her.

300
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:53,190
King Suruli only will marry her.

301
00:28:53,364 --> 00:28:55,525
King Suruli only will marry her.

302
00:29:22,193 --> 00:29:28,598
Oh my Myna!
You are troubling in my heart.

303
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:35,204
Don't know how but you are killing me.

304
00:29:35,507 --> 00:29:41,878
Tell me what happened
without hiding from me.

305
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:47,746
Don't smile with your eyes
touching my heart.

306
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:54,382
Is it right for you
to try to avoid me?

307
00:29:54,526 --> 00:30:01,329
Is it fair to you to leave me alone?

308
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:08,472
I don't understand anything
Come and give your answer.

309
00:30:08,673 --> 00:30:11,540
Oh Myna! Myna!

310
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:37,867
Like kerosene for the lamp!..
Like heat in winter.

311
00:30:38,102 --> 00:30:44,701
You are for me and my life is for you.

312
00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:51,537
Desire will come around like a wheel.

313
00:30:51,716 --> 00:30:57,382
Wish to draw the moustache
with the collyrium.

314
00:30:57,522 --> 00:31:03,984
Are you the thread made from sand?

315
00:31:04,128 --> 00:31:11,128
Are you the curd to churn my life?

316
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:18,008
Oh my Myna!
You are troubling in my heart.

317
00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:24,839
Don't know how but you are killing me.

318
00:31:54,345 --> 00:32:00,682
Like bullock cart search its way
and the sling searching for the stone.

319
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:07,757
With dried heart,
I too am searching for you.

320
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:14,296
Though I went to the school,
I couldn't study.

321
00:32:14,565 --> 00:32:20,265
To play the game you are not near me

322
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:26,901
I'll win this world if you are with me.

323
00:32:27,011 --> 00:32:34,011
In the dream if you disappear
I'll think about you.

324
00:32:34,485 --> 00:32:40,822
Oh my Myna!
You are troubling in my heart.

325
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:47,291
Don't know how but you are killing me.

326
00:32:47,732 --> 00:32:54,103
Tell me what happened
without hiding from me.

327
00:32:54,339 --> 00:33:00,039
Don't smile with your eyes
touching my heart.

328
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:06,572
Is it right for you to try to avoid me?

329
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:13,657
Is it fair to you to leave me alone?

330
00:33:13,858 --> 00:33:20,730
I can't recognize you!
Are you a new born child?

331
00:33:20,898 --> 00:33:23,890
Oh Myna!

332
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:29,137
Why do you stare like this?

333
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:31,170
- Are you crazy?
- Not that.

334
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:34,073
In films the hero will do like this.

335
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:36,043
Do you want to do like that?

336
00:33:36,147 --> 00:33:37,273
Can't you see me better?

337
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,908
The last one is better than this.

338
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:45,980
Oops! My legs are painful as I had
to climb down the hill

339
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:48,285
and walk through the market road.

340
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:52,257
Dear! Study well and go to work.

341
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:54,762
Then only our sufferings
will come to an end!

342
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:56,830
Did you have your food?

343
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:06,167
Are you drawing a saw?

344
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:11,442
No. It is a Vernier Caliper!

345
00:34:12,683 --> 00:34:14,378
Is it a veneer(Hot water) machine?

346
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:18,288
That's why I told you to study well.

347
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:19,879
You are studying well, isn't it?

348
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:21,950
The power is gone.

349
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,585
Where is the lamp, sister?

350
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:25,753
Kerosene went out of stock today

351
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,728
I have to get it from the ration shop.

352
00:34:27,932 --> 00:34:30,867
When I inquired
the shop was not yet opened!

353
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:32,526
Come with me.
You can study tomorrow.

354
00:34:32,637 --> 00:34:34,764
Tomorrow is the exam.
There are 4 lessons!

355
00:34:34,872 --> 00:34:36,237
How will I learn that?

356
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,329
Why are you angry for that?

357
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:39,770
You want to study right?
Just a minute.

358
00:35:17,748 --> 00:35:18,680
Study dear.

359
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:54,517
Have you studied?

360
00:35:55,887 --> 00:35:57,184
There is a lesson more.

361
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:00,689
Ok! You go inside,
I'll come.

362
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:01,621
Where are you going?

363
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,224
I'll be back.

364
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,813
Go dear! Go and study.

365
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:11,785
Give it.
Don't spill it.

366
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:15,124
Can't you wake her up
early in the morning?

367
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:17,428
I have to cycle fast
for her to reach on time!

368
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:20,199
She is studying. Can she
go in anxiety during exams?

369
00:37:21,505 --> 00:37:22,904
What will she do after studying?

370
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:28,072
I want to get her married.

371
00:37:30,815 --> 00:37:32,749
She is studying
She doesn't need a marriage now.

372
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:40,713
Logu told me that there is a learned
groom in the nearby village

373
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:44,486
I don't think that she will get
a better place than this.

374
00:37:45,863 --> 00:37:47,694
What are you looking at, son-in-law?

375
00:37:47,865 --> 00:37:50,197
Come.
Let us arrange for that.

376
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:58,265
How dare you call me
to finalise a different groom?

377
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:00,342
- I'll kill you.
- He is killing me.

378
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:01,638
- Don't leave her.
- Won't you ask him?

379
00:38:01,746 --> 00:38:03,543
Did any educated guy help you?

380
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:06,081
If you had helped me,
will you marry my daughter?

381
00:38:06,751 --> 00:38:09,219
- Let us settle this once for all.
- Let us see.

382
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,652
Did you give lakhs
of money to marry my daughter?

383
00:38:11,756 --> 00:38:13,781
- You damned beggar! Drop it.
- I'll kill you.

384
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:17,819
If you tell that Myna is not for me..

385
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:21,454
I'll set fire on you.
Leave me.

386
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:24,259
Let us see who will set fire on whom!

387
00:38:24,435 --> 00:38:26,801
- Let us see.
- Don't imagine to marry my daughter.

388
00:38:26,904 --> 00:38:28,804
Don't imagine to perform
her marriage with someone.

389
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:33,233
- She is mine.
- I'll smash you. -Flee from here.

390
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:37,041
Son! My son!
You are mine!

391
00:38:37,181 --> 00:38:38,239
You are my lion!

392
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:41,817
Forget Myna!
I'll get you a princess

393
00:38:41,952 --> 00:38:44,648
I want my Myna.
Should I tell you separately?

394
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:47,155
- Go. I'll kill you.
- You sinner! Why did you hit your dad?

395
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:49,488
Shall I ask your support? Go.

396
00:38:49,593 --> 00:38:52,221
You sinner! Won't you be prosperous?

397
00:38:54,365 --> 00:38:56,697
I am telling you that
don't speak about Myna, isn't it?

398
00:38:56,901 --> 00:38:59,893
- Shut your mouth.
- Why did you hit your useless dad?

399
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:03,906
Leave him Suruli! Had you told me,
I would've taken care of him.

400
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,538
You go and complain
I'll come as the witness

401
00:39:07,978 --> 00:39:11,812
I don't need your support
I will see you all in a cell surely.

402
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,711
Let us see if it is you or me.

403
00:39:14,985 --> 00:39:19,479
Go man. Go man.
I said you to go.

404
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:23,188
Why have you all assembled here?

405
00:39:24,895 --> 00:39:26,658
I won't give my girl to a dog like you.

406
00:39:37,641 --> 00:39:39,404
She only told that day.

407
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:40,374
Damn woman!

408
00:39:40,845 --> 00:39:42,745
Hit her.
Damn woman.

409
00:39:55,292 --> 00:39:56,259
You go.
I'll see to it.

410
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:03,266
- Suruli!
- You stop.

411
00:40:03,467 --> 00:40:06,595
- Let him leave sir.
- Go man.

412
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:08,564
He hasn't done any mistake, sir.

413
00:40:08,939 --> 00:40:10,804
Take her with you

414
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:13,236
I will be back soon! Go.

415
00:40:15,212 --> 00:40:16,770
Did you try to drop
a stone on the woman?

416
00:40:17,014 --> 00:40:19,073
From childhood she told me that..

417
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:23,181
Stop it. Did you try to
drop the stone? -Yes sir.

418
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:35,023
These 14 days in the cell
were horrible for me.

419
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:38,297
In 2 days, I'll go and see Myna!

420
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,800
Stop!
You go!

421
00:40:42,907 --> 00:40:45,467
Let the next man come. Stop.

422
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:53,448
Deepavali Special feast:
Courtesy: Rotary Club.

423
00:40:54,685 --> 00:40:56,448
- Greetings sir.
- Who are they, your children? -Yes sir.

424
00:40:56,887 --> 00:40:57,979
They wanted to see the function.

425
00:40:58,088 --> 00:40:59,220
- Is it so?
- So I brought them here.

426
00:40:59,256 --> 00:41:01,656
After the function, we are going to
the native place to celebrate Deepavali.

427
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:17,296
- What is this?
- Ball

428
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:19,441
I know, but why do you
hit on my chest?

429
00:41:19,777 --> 00:41:21,540
Tell me where to hit.
I'll hit it there

430
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:23,135
I will beat you to pulp.

431
00:41:23,247 --> 00:41:26,011
Don't talk unnecessarily sir.
Look there sir

432
00:41:26,217 --> 00:41:27,514
I am playing with my Myna!

433
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:30,711
Throw the ball to me sir.
MYNA.

434
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:33,790
Write down also many names?

435
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:36,153
Damn it. Who is that Myna?

436
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:40,688
- Don't you know her?
- Who is she?

437
00:41:40,931 --> 00:41:41,795
Come close.

438
00:41:42,933 --> 00:41:45,493
- Come I said.
- Who will be that? Sit down sir.

439
00:41:46,704 --> 00:41:49,434
- Who is that Myna?
- Don't you know her?

440
00:41:50,741 --> 00:41:51,969
Is it the new SP who has come?

441
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:53,705
Above that sir!

442
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:57,544
Above that is IG Mallika.

443
00:41:57,748 --> 00:42:01,206
- Above that sir.
- Above that?

444
00:42:01,752 --> 00:42:03,083
DGP Lathika Saran!

445
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:05,246
Above that sir!

446
00:42:05,623 --> 00:42:09,616
- Who is above that?
- My soul sir.

447
00:42:11,328 --> 00:42:14,729
In the childhood she entered my eyes.

448
00:42:14,965 --> 00:42:18,526
She passed through this way.

449
00:42:18,802 --> 00:42:24,672
She filled my body and spread allover.

450
00:42:24,775 --> 00:42:26,402
- You prisoner!
- Myna!

451
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:28,501
- You nasty guy.
- Myna!

452
00:42:28,812 --> 00:42:31,406
Open your eyes
Are you making me a fool?

453
00:42:31,515 --> 00:42:33,005
Is she spread allover?

454
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:35,377
Is she the chilly put on
the terrace to get dry?

455
00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:40,548
When others are working out side..

456
00:42:40,658 --> 00:42:42,751
He is playing with a ball with Myna!

457
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,487
Come and play with me.
Come.

458
00:42:44,628 --> 00:42:45,822
Come and play with me.
Come.

459
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:51,800
- Are you playing ball?
- I didn't play sir.

460
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:56,133
Why do you call him?
He is doing his work.

461
00:42:57,641 --> 00:43:00,508
He is playing inside and
is acting outside.

462
00:43:00,978 --> 00:43:02,002
Tell him what happened, Suruli!

463
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:04,904
- Greetings sir.
- Tell me.

464
00:43:05,149 --> 00:43:10,109
Warden sir was calling everyone
to play ball from morning.

465
00:43:11,622 --> 00:43:14,785
Should I work or play ball
with the Warden?

466
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:18,328
- You do the work first.
- He is lying sir.

467
00:43:18,495 --> 00:43:21,589
You apply for leave
and play in your house. -Sir, I..

468
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:23,630
In half an hour
the chief guest will arrive.

469
00:43:23,734 --> 00:43:25,224
- Sir me..
- I am going there believing you.

470
00:43:25,402 --> 00:43:28,701
- No sir, me..
- What is it, Ramaiah? -You idiot!

471
00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:33,002
My wife is on the line! Manage her.

472
00:43:34,178 --> 00:43:35,839
He gave it to me.

473
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:40,047
Madam! Ramaiah speaking
from the Periyakulam sub jail.

474
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:41,649
What the hell is he doing there?

475
00:43:41,752 --> 00:43:45,244
- Hell!
- Give the phone to her

476
00:43:45,356 --> 00:43:49,793
I'll do that. -Sir!
Your wife wants to talk to you.

477
00:43:49,893 --> 00:43:50,882
Manage her I said

478
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:53,828
I couldn't stand her.
Talk to her.

479
00:43:53,931 --> 00:43:56,331
My wife has brought me
as straight forward

480
00:43:56,867 --> 00:44:01,463
I know well now that the great men
have no respect at home.

481
00:44:01,572 --> 00:44:05,508
He is tense and wants to
make a fool tense, like me.

482
00:44:08,245 --> 00:44:11,976
- What?
- Should I tell sir about it?

483
00:44:12,383 --> 00:44:14,476
You don't need to tell anything.

484
00:44:14,618 --> 00:44:16,176
It is enough telling about me.
Shut up and go.

485
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:19,651
- Is it sir's box?
- My box.

486
00:44:19,757 --> 00:44:20,815
There is enough time.

487
00:44:21,091 --> 00:44:22,285
Do you know what the time is?

488
00:44:22,393 --> 00:44:23,860
In half an hour
the function will be over

489
00:44:24,128 --> 00:44:25,192
I will be there in a short while.

490
00:44:25,229 --> 00:44:27,222
We have to start now
so as to reach there in time.

491
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:28,263
Listen to me.

492
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:36,830
In this world everyone
is a prisoner in one way or other.

493
00:44:37,307 --> 00:44:39,605
Few are outside and a
few inside the bars.

494
00:44:39,877 --> 00:44:46,305
In the life, love, peace, patience,
good character, kindness..

495
00:44:46,417 --> 00:44:49,511
Belief, control..

496
00:44:49,753 --> 00:44:53,189
Those with these qualities
can endure any situation.

497
00:45:01,932 --> 00:45:03,797
Tell me. -Sudha!
We have reached Madurai.

498
00:45:03,901 --> 00:45:04,765
Where are you now?

499
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:07,063
I am in my house.
He is in the jail.

500
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:09,105
What are you saying?
Haven't you started yet?

501
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:11,800
How do I know?
The groom is your selection.

502
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:12,841
You ask him.

503
00:45:12,943 --> 00:45:14,672
Wait. I'll call you
after talking with the groom.

504
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,308
What brother?
Where is Sudha?

505
00:45:17,414 --> 00:45:18,779
He hasn't come from his work yet.

506
00:45:19,016 --> 00:45:21,678
You brought him from
Thanjavur that he is good man.

507
00:45:22,152 --> 00:45:23,779
- Why do you angry?
- Is he your friend's son?

508
00:45:27,791 --> 00:45:28,849
Haven't you started yet?

509
00:45:28,893 --> 00:45:30,191
I told you, the clothes
have to be bought

510
00:45:30,192 --> 00:45:31,288
10 days before the first Deepavali.

511
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:32,953
But you have not shown up so far!

512
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:34,758
We haven't bought any clothes
for the children yet.

513
00:45:34,865 --> 00:45:36,492
Tomorrow is the Deepavali!
When are you showing up?

514
00:45:36,767 --> 00:45:37,931
I am in a function, brother-in-law.

515
00:45:37,935 --> 00:45:40,260
Go home fast groom
Sudha is ready to come.

516
00:45:40,871 --> 00:45:42,498
Ok. I'll call you after the function.

517
00:45:43,841 --> 00:45:45,033
Sir! We shall distribute the sweets!

518
00:46:14,138 --> 00:46:16,663
- What is it?
- Wish you a maiden Deepavali!

519
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:17,904
Did you bring it in the accounts!

520
00:46:17,908 --> 00:46:19,107
There were many sweets.

521
00:46:19,209 --> 00:46:20,669
I took it to give it
to the neighbourhood kids.

522
00:46:20,711 --> 00:46:22,306
An accused has escaped, sir.

523
00:46:26,049 --> 00:46:28,711
I don't know sir.
I don't know him sir.

524
00:46:28,819 --> 00:46:30,184
Wait for a minute.

525
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:32,187
Who has been with him for 10 days?

526
00:46:32,422 --> 00:46:33,650
We don't know it, sir.

527
00:46:33,757 --> 00:46:35,816
- Is it you? -Be frank!
- Truly we don't know sir.

528
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:37,492
- Is he your mate?
- I don't know him.

529
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:39,160
- Sir.
- What is it?

530
00:46:39,329 --> 00:46:42,958
These 5 people were talking
to him yesterday night.

531
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:44,226
Get up! Show me those 5 men!

532
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:47,699
That with white banyan,
black shirt and these three men.

533
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:48,965
Get up. Come, you too.

534
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:50,766
What were you talking?

535
00:46:50,874 --> 00:46:53,138
We didn't talk to him
He was talking to us.

536
00:46:53,243 --> 00:46:54,173
What was he talking to you?

537
00:46:54,178 --> 00:46:56,078
- Tell me.
- He asked us what love is.

538
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:58,907
He said javvu..
And he said jivvu!

539
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:01,714
- What is this?
- Fingers!

540
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:03,719
Fingers! Suruli!

541
00:47:04,388 --> 00:47:06,083
What is near Suruli?

542
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:07,483
You tell!

543
00:47:09,259 --> 00:47:10,954
It is Kumili!

544
00:47:11,128 --> 00:47:13,062
No. Myna!

545
00:47:13,297 --> 00:47:15,697
What is in between Suruli and Myna?

546
00:47:15,933 --> 00:47:18,401
- There is gap!
- Are you driving the train?

547
00:47:19,403 --> 00:47:21,871
- You tell me. What is in the gap?
- I don't know.

548
00:47:22,139 --> 00:47:24,801
Nobody knows it.

549
00:47:24,975 --> 00:47:28,502
Kuruvamma also told the same.
She is very wise.

550
00:47:28,612 --> 00:47:29,738
Tell me that you don't know it.

551
00:47:31,114 --> 00:47:33,708
You are asking me
this for the last 3 hours!

552
00:47:35,586 --> 00:47:39,181
Old man! Nobody should
leave without telling it.

553
00:47:39,289 --> 00:47:41,951
- Sir.
- Suruli! I feel sleepy!

554
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:45,059
Feeling sleepy?
I will kill you.

555
00:47:45,295 --> 00:47:47,354
Tell me.
What is in the gap?

556
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:49,294
He didn't tell anything
else other than this.

557
00:47:53,804 --> 00:47:57,501
After lunch a boy
came here to see him.

558
00:48:11,255 --> 00:48:12,882
Were you all watching this?

559
00:48:15,525 --> 00:48:20,553
You boy! Don't fall down
while untying the flag!

560
00:48:20,664 --> 00:48:23,098
Ask someone to hold the ladder, fool.

561
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:26,827
Whose bags are these two?
Don't know. -Shall I take it?

562
00:48:26,937 --> 00:48:29,337
They are mine.
Why do you touch it?

563
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:30,269
Damn guys.

564
00:48:34,845 --> 00:48:36,642
An accused have escaped
because of you..

565
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,840
As you were after a box of sweets.

566
00:48:39,816 --> 00:48:43,377
If they come to know this
they will take some action on me.

567
00:48:44,321 --> 00:48:45,117
- Sir!
- Tell me.

568
00:48:45,222 --> 00:48:47,349
- Sir! That is..
- Go and play ball.

569
00:48:47,457 --> 00:48:48,253
Not that sir.

570
00:48:48,492 --> 00:48:51,893
If an accused escape before
we were suspended for 3 months.

571
00:48:52,129 --> 00:48:54,529
But now, they will remand everyone.

572
00:48:55,332 --> 00:48:57,357
My retirement is only 40 days ahead.

573
00:48:57,467 --> 00:48:58,593
They would deduct from my pension.

574
00:48:59,002 --> 00:49:02,028
Sir! There won't be
any promotion for 3 years.

575
00:49:02,139 --> 00:49:04,733
You made them to escape
and talking law now.

576
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:06,705
Sir! We have to inform
the superintendent,.

577
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:07,672
I know that.

578
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:09,507
Central Jail, Madurai.

579
00:49:11,315 --> 00:49:13,943
Baskar talking from
Periyakulam Sub Jail.

580
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:16,711
Tell me Baskar.
Did the function go very well?

581
00:49:16,887 --> 00:49:18,411
The function was very good.

582
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:20,757
- There was a problem here.
- What is that?

583
00:49:21,091 --> 00:49:23,958
During the function,
an accused escaped from here.

584
00:49:24,194 --> 00:49:25,627
You tend to take it easy.

585
00:49:26,563 --> 00:49:29,589
Can't 7 police officers
able to watch about 25 accused?

586
00:49:29,833 --> 00:49:31,960
Were you unaware of the incident?

587
00:49:32,069 --> 00:49:34,902
Escorts were there as a
safety measure! -What safety?

588
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:39,006
Those escaped from the eyes of the
dept. Could be a terrorist or a outlaw.

589
00:49:39,109 --> 00:49:40,940
The officers would be
very much annoyed..

590
00:49:41,044 --> 00:49:43,638
When the accused has escaped
who was in the police custody.

591
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:45,949
What if the escape convict dies?

592
00:49:46,283 --> 00:49:47,910
Don't you read the daily?

593
00:49:48,085 --> 00:49:50,485
Public and the press
are very active now!

594
00:49:50,587 --> 00:49:51,519
They will be very bothersome.

595
00:49:51,688 --> 00:49:53,383
Can you manage without reaching
the IG for a day?

596
00:49:53,523 --> 00:49:54,649
Which station did he get arrested?

597
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:56,816
He is the convict arrested
in Kurangani Station.

598
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:59,528
He is from Sevvangudi
village on the hill

599
00:49:59,763 --> 00:50:03,563
I won't take any action on you
and I will take risk for you -Ok.

600
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:05,658
Before night, find him
and put in the cell.

601
00:50:05,769 --> 00:50:07,669
If he is out of reach
tomorrow is a holiday..

602
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:09,465
As it is Deepavali Day.

603
00:50:09,573 --> 00:50:10,797
- Try to catch him tomorrow.
- Ok sir.

604
00:50:10,807 --> 00:50:12,334
Or else I will have to inform the IG.

605
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:15,401
You will have to face
the problem, then.

606
00:50:17,781 --> 00:50:18,941
What did the superintendent say, sir?

607
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:20,615
He has given a day's time!

608
00:50:32,662 --> 00:50:35,563
Oh dear! Where are you?

609
00:50:37,601 --> 00:50:40,331
Chenthamarai!
There was a problem here

610
00:50:41,138 --> 00:50:42,366
I'll come there in half an hour!

611
00:50:42,739 --> 00:50:44,764
I told you,
I'll come there in half an hour!

612
00:50:45,342 --> 00:50:46,206
Disconnect the phone.

613
00:50:48,445 --> 00:50:51,903
My wife was talking from the house.
She has cooked the meat.

614
00:50:52,149 --> 00:50:54,413
We used to celebrate in my
mother-in-law's house every year.

615
00:50:54,484 --> 00:50:55,712
That's why I told her
that I am coming.

616
00:50:59,589 --> 00:51:00,521
Start!

617
00:51:06,763 --> 00:51:09,391
Stop talking and listen to what I say

618
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,165
I asked for permission from my boss.

619
00:51:11,301 --> 00:51:12,290
He told me to go

620
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:14,666
I knew only now that
I had to go with him.

621
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:17,499
Look! You go to Usilampatti!

622
00:51:18,308 --> 00:51:20,469
THENI
Evening -3:50 O' clock.

623
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:35,018
Sudha! I forgot it.
Sorry, a little tension.

624
00:51:35,025 --> 00:51:37,220
Are we going for Deepavali or not?

625
00:51:37,394 --> 00:51:40,192
If you tell me that, I'll undress
and do the other jobs.

626
00:51:40,297 --> 00:51:42,162
Sudha! Listen to what I say.

627
00:51:42,332 --> 00:51:44,232
An accused escaped
during today's function

628
00:51:44,334 --> 00:51:45,301
I am on my way to find him out

629
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:47,730
I don't need all that.
When are you coming?

630
00:51:47,971 --> 00:51:49,666
The superintendent has given
only a day's time.

631
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:51,832
- If he is not found before tonight..
- When are you coming?

632
00:51:52,209 --> 00:51:55,042
If he is not caught we seven people
will lose our jobs!

633
00:51:55,145 --> 00:51:56,407
When are you coming?

634
00:51:56,513 --> 00:51:59,209
- Better you start now. I'll come later.
- When are you coming?

635
00:51:59,316 --> 00:52:01,011
Don't you understand what I say?

636
00:52:01,251 --> 00:52:03,242
You start right away.
I'll talk to brother-in-law.

637
00:52:12,329 --> 00:52:14,695
- I am Baskar here.

MADURAI -Melamasi road
Evening -4:10 O' clock.

639
00:52:18,668 --> 00:52:20,431

I can hear you. Tell me

641
00:52:23,874 --> 00:52:25,039
I'm in Theni only.

642
00:52:25,075 --> 00:52:26,564
There was a problem
in the function yesterday.

643
00:52:26,576 --> 00:52:27,873
He hasn't started yet from there.

644
00:52:28,111 --> 00:52:30,045
Haven't you started yet?

645
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:34,546
- Give it to me.
- When will you start and when will...?

646
00:52:34,751 --> 00:52:36,082
Stop your talk altogether!

647
00:52:36,186 --> 00:52:37,210
One can talk at a time.

648
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,220
Brother-in-law.
Listen to me what I say.

649
00:52:39,456 --> 00:52:42,619
There was a problem here
I can't bring Sudha there.

650
00:52:42,726 --> 00:52:44,455
- I have told her to come there.
- Alone?

651
00:52:44,561 --> 00:52:48,190
She will come there Don't mistake me

652
00:52:48,365 --> 00:52:49,730
I will be there at dawn.

653
00:52:50,066 --> 00:52:51,590

Take it.

657
00:53:23,433 --> 00:53:25,128
Open the door.

658
00:53:25,802 --> 00:53:28,430
- It is not possible.
- I'll see.

659
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:30,529
Her marriage is with
the guy I selected.

660
00:53:30,674 --> 00:53:33,472
- I'll do that.
- That will never happen.

661
00:53:33,577 --> 00:53:36,045
Let me see who is to come.

662
00:53:36,179 --> 00:53:39,808
If you don't go,
I will set fire to the entire house.

663
00:53:40,917 --> 00:53:44,444
Where do you try to run?

664
00:53:48,692 --> 00:53:54,562
Listen! I will kill you..
If anything happens to Myna.

665
00:53:54,664 --> 00:53:55,995

Which is the way to Sevvangudi?

00:54:16,286 --> 00:54:19,221
You have to climb 2 hills for that.

670
00:54:19,356 --> 00:54:20,618
You can't go now as it is dark.

671
00:54:20,724 --> 00:54:22,658
A jeep will come in the morning
You can go in that.

672
00:54:25,128 --> 00:54:27,392
Will it come only in the morning?
What shall we do till then?

673
00:54:29,232 --> 00:54:30,221
Give me a match box.

674
00:54:31,901 --> 00:54:33,630
It is a forest where tigers roam here.

675
00:54:33,737 --> 00:54:36,638
We shall sit in the bus stand
and go in the morning.

676
00:54:37,707 --> 00:54:40,801
Do you want to have feast
for Deepavali or not? -That's true.

677
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:44,277
What if the tiger eat us
and enjoy Deepavali?

678
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:45,778
Come without fear.

679
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:50,415
Oh dear! Where are you?

680
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:53,279
It is me calling from the forest.

681
00:54:53,556 --> 00:54:55,524
Have you reached Usalampatti?

682
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:59,061
Talk softly.
Animals will come

683
00:54:59,763 --> 00:55:01,094
I will come if I am alive.

684
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:04,399
Is the connection cut off?

685
00:55:04,534 --> 00:55:06,661
- Are you happy now?
- Come without blabbering!

686
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:08,930
- I am coming with you, right?
- What if you come?

687
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:12,770
Do you have experience
in forest like Veerappan?

688
00:55:12,909 --> 00:55:15,935
Go sir! You've decided to finish me off.

689
00:55:16,613 --> 00:55:18,581
Oh God! Please save me.

690
00:55:24,688 --> 00:55:26,952
Hey Baskar! Come to me.

691
00:55:27,123 --> 00:55:30,024
- What did you say?
- There is the tiger.

692
00:55:30,126 --> 00:55:31,559
It is the photo of the tiger

693
00:55:32,595 --> 00:55:37,794
I saw the tiger.
Is it a photo?

694
00:55:38,234 --> 00:55:39,462
Wait sir.

695
00:55:43,073 --> 00:55:44,199
We shall go now.

696
00:55:44,374 --> 00:55:45,966
- Take care sir.
- What are you telling?

697
00:55:46,076 --> 00:55:47,202
Someone might have pissed here.

698
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:49,175
- Who will do that here?
- I would have pissed.

699
00:55:49,279 --> 00:55:51,941
We have to piss after seeing the tiger
to pay respect for the tiger.

700
00:55:52,449 --> 00:55:55,612
Nasty. You got afraid when
seeing the tiger's photo!

701
00:55:55,719 --> 00:55:57,380
What would have happen
if you had seen the real tiger?

702
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:00,216
- It would have been like this.
- Dry your dress.

703
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:01,984
It will get dry by air.

704
00:56:06,563 --> 00:56:09,999
Oops! The rock fell in the valley

705
00:56:10,133 --> 00:56:12,124
I don't care about my job.

706
00:56:12,635 --> 00:56:14,899
- I wouldn't mind even if you abuse me.
- Wait

707
00:56:15,004 --> 00:56:18,599
I will not come forward even a feet!
I will move only when it is dawn.

708
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:25,276
Deepavali morning
6:30 am.

709
00:56:35,925 --> 00:56:36,755
Ramaiah.

710
00:56:40,463 --> 00:56:42,158
Sevvangudi
Morning 6:45 am.

711
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:01,208
WELCOME

712
00:57:01,985 --> 00:57:04,818
Welcome?! You damn woman!

713
00:57:05,355 --> 00:57:07,619
They have put the light in the day.

714
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:11,158
Damn light. I'll see to you later.

715
00:57:24,073 --> 00:57:27,406
Kuruvamma! Let us see
when you will open it

716
00:57:28,244 --> 00:57:29,211
I will open it.

717
00:57:29,312 --> 00:57:30,677
All will come whom I have invited

718
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:32,145
I'll open then.

719
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:36,752
Sir! Look, is there signal in your cell?

720
00:57:39,222 --> 00:57:39,852
No.

721
00:57:40,323 --> 00:57:41,647
Being the auspicious day,
he has made me..

722
00:57:41,658 --> 00:57:42,716
Roam in the middle of the jungle.

723
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:45,359
Let the damn guy get caught.

724
00:58:07,784 --> 00:58:11,276
Why did you bring me
when others are there in the jail?

725
00:58:11,454 --> 00:58:12,978
You are the right man for everything.

726
00:59:01,504 --> 00:59:02,630
What are you looking?

727
00:59:02,739 --> 00:59:04,104
Are you waiting for
the groom's people?

728
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:05,834
Skull Manickam is there.

729
00:59:05,942 --> 00:59:07,239
Don't get afraid.

730
00:59:07,944 --> 00:59:10,742
Go man. Don't fire
crackers when I am annoyed.

731
00:59:10,847 --> 00:59:11,836
Go man.

732
00:59:15,885 --> 00:59:17,375
He stands like a beggar

733
00:59:17,854 --> 00:59:19,151
heir of my heredity.

734
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:23,355
Look there. He is standing
there on a festival day.

735
00:59:23,626 --> 00:59:26,527
Chinna kaalai! No one has
belittled our heredity.

736
00:59:26,663 --> 00:59:28,290
We have cut off his
relationship with us..

737
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:30,229
When he hit us in
the middle of the road.

738
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,833
Why do you talk about him?

739
00:59:31,935 --> 00:59:33,061
Eat and keep quiet!

740
00:59:33,169 --> 00:59:35,069
Don't try to quarrel with
him in the festival day.

741
00:59:35,338 --> 00:59:38,136
My daughter bought new dress
for me by her hard work.

742
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:41,972
If I had a girl in your place,
I would've got another shirt piece!

743
00:59:42,111 --> 00:59:44,671
Your dad doesn't seem to buy
a shirt piece by his hard work.

744
00:59:44,781 --> 00:59:45,873
Why are you staring at me?

745
00:59:46,316 --> 00:59:49,308
You don't know about our heredity.

746
00:59:50,019 --> 00:59:52,351
He says about some heredity.

747
00:59:52,522 --> 00:59:54,990
- What heredity is that?
- Nasty heredity.

748
00:59:56,993 --> 00:59:58,460
It is visible from the house.

749
00:59:58,561 --> 01:00:00,688
Give them if anything is left out.

750
01:00:00,797 --> 01:00:05,825
- Take a stone.
- What are they planning?

751
01:00:06,803 --> 01:00:08,065
Is it his head or the forehead?

752
01:00:08,171 --> 01:00:09,365
My God! He has taken the stone!

753
01:00:09,472 --> 01:00:10,996
- Your wish!
- I'll try for his mouth

754
01:00:11,808 --> 01:00:13,002
I'll tell to your dad.

755
01:00:13,676 --> 01:00:14,643
Don't mingle with the wastrel!

756
01:00:14,744 --> 01:00:18,680
- I've already hit my dad.
- They'll finish me off.

757
01:00:20,249 --> 01:00:21,407
Are you hitting me with a hired hand?

758
01:00:21,851 --> 01:00:24,046
- I would kill you.
- Go man.

759
01:00:28,324 --> 01:00:31,054
Somehow we have reached the town.

760
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:34,328
Shop keeper! Do you know Suruli's house?

761
01:00:34,697 --> 01:00:35,857
Is it his house?

762
01:00:36,666 --> 01:00:40,193
Get down the pit, and climb the hill.

763
01:00:40,336 --> 01:00:41,234
It is there

764
01:00:41,371 --> 01:00:44,568
Pierce me with that here.
My intestines will come out.

765
01:00:44,674 --> 01:00:46,301
When I ask the address,
you are operating me.

766
01:00:49,278 --> 01:00:51,542
- Morning 7:45 AM.
- He is making my life difficult.

767
01:00:51,914 --> 01:00:53,108
Where has he gone?

768
01:00:55,385 --> 01:00:58,445
Are you here?
It is your funeral.

769
01:00:58,588 --> 01:01:01,352
Everyone will come now
I'll see to you!

770
01:01:09,699 --> 01:01:11,690
Wear it before they come.

771
01:01:14,203 --> 01:01:16,831
If you don't wear it
I will set myself ablaze.

772
01:01:21,044 --> 01:01:25,071
Set fire. You were
telling it since last night.

773
01:01:25,248 --> 01:01:27,341
Go and die.
I will go away from here.

774
01:01:27,617 --> 01:01:31,018
Has he become dearer than me?

775
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:34,280
If given a little room will
he take advantage? -Leave me.

776
01:01:34,457 --> 01:01:36,322
Shameless girl.

777
01:01:36,426 --> 01:01:38,792
If you want to belittle me
and go with him..

778
01:01:38,895 --> 01:01:40,863
You will drop dead.

779
01:01:40,963 --> 01:01:42,521
Hey Kuruvamma! Leave her.

780
01:01:42,632 --> 01:01:44,896
- Will you wear the sari or not?
- Go away.

781
01:01:46,669 --> 01:01:49,365
Open the door.

782
01:01:49,672 --> 01:01:51,139
If anything happens to her,
you will be dead.

783
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:53,475
- You will be ruined.
- Open the door.

784
01:01:53,576 --> 01:01:56,067
You won't come good.

785
01:01:56,212 --> 01:01:58,578
Look! -I want to see
if it is she or you.

786
01:01:58,981 --> 01:02:01,916
Open the door
Look! I won't go without Myna!

787
01:02:03,252 --> 01:02:04,310
What are you doing?

788
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:05,387
Welcome Logu!

789
01:02:05,488 --> 01:02:06,580
Have you brought the proposal?

790
01:02:06,689 --> 01:02:08,748
- Don't you have any work?
- Go man.

791
01:02:08,991 --> 01:02:10,549
Who do you think you are?

792
01:02:10,793 --> 01:02:11,985
Keep talking with him.
I'll be back.

793
01:02:11,994 --> 01:02:13,461
- I will see to you.
- Go man.

794
01:02:13,830 --> 01:02:15,195
It is none of your work.

795
01:02:15,331 --> 01:02:17,561
You don't know about us.
Take back all of them.

796
01:02:17,667 --> 01:02:20,227
Listen to me.

797
01:02:20,970 --> 01:02:24,406
- Come out. What are you doing inside?
- You stay away.

798
01:02:25,842 --> 01:02:28,242
Hell with him Come with me.

799
01:02:28,611 --> 01:02:31,011
Where are they?

800
01:02:31,347 --> 01:02:33,747
- You will spoil your life yourself.
- Brother! Don't you know it?

801
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:37,680
- We were together since childhood.
- You will be in the road.

802
01:02:38,454 --> 01:02:39,386
What are you talking?

803
01:02:39,555 --> 01:02:42,080
You brought him up as your son in law.

804
01:02:42,291 --> 01:02:43,883
Now you are looking for a groom for me

805
01:02:44,026 --> 01:02:46,859
I will kill you if you
want to separate us. -Kill me.

806
01:02:47,363 --> 01:02:50,389
- Look! I will marry him only.
- Listen to her.

807
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:54,766
If you try to marry me,
I will die off. -Why should you die?

808
01:02:55,037 --> 01:02:56,800
If anyone tries for her
I'll chop his hands.

809
01:02:56,939 --> 01:02:59,373
- What is this, Logu?
- You have hurried for this.

810
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:01,099
After seeing the photo
you were satisfied.

811
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:03,337
You said that your brother is coming..
From Kuwait in a week's time..

812
01:03:03,379 --> 01:03:04,739
And that you wanted
the marriage in 4 days..

813
01:03:04,747 --> 01:03:05,939
No matter if it is a festival day.

814
01:03:06,048 --> 01:03:08,710
If hurried it would be like that only
Be patient. Let us talk then.

815
01:03:08,885 --> 01:03:10,318
- Why should we be patient?
- Be patient.

816
01:03:10,486 --> 01:03:12,511
Can we bring
the damn girl into our house?

817
01:03:13,156 --> 01:03:14,680
- Who is the damn girl?
- How dare you touch her?

818
01:03:15,424 --> 01:03:16,652
I'll cut you into pieces.

819
01:03:16,826 --> 01:03:18,418
- Suruli, please leave the place.
- You go away.

820
01:03:18,561 --> 01:03:19,789
He'll come down Let's see him then.

821
01:03:19,896 --> 01:03:22,296
Hey Pechiyamma!
The problem has started.

822
01:03:22,431 --> 01:03:23,329
Come, let's watch it.

823
01:03:24,267 --> 01:03:26,000
Thank god! We know the
matter before marriage. -Oh gosh!

824
01:03:26,002 --> 01:03:28,496
- Don't go.
- Leave me.

825
01:03:28,604 --> 01:03:30,572
- Don't believe his words!
- Leave me.

826
01:03:30,706 --> 01:03:35,268
Oh God! I'll fall at your feet.

827
01:03:35,845 --> 01:03:39,508
Don't go believing his words

828
01:03:40,183 --> 01:03:42,708
I've not brought up
my daughter like that.

829
01:03:43,085 --> 01:03:46,748
That damn guy has
spoiled my daughter's mind.

830
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:47,853
He won't be prosperous

831
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:49,457
I'm cursing him He will be ruined.

832
01:03:49,559 --> 01:03:50,958
He won't prosper.
I am her mom cursing you.

833
01:03:51,093 --> 01:03:54,324
Hey Kuruvamma!
Did you think you are a queen?

834
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:55,462
What will you do now?

835
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:58,027
Don't stare at me
I'll pluck your eyes.

836
01:03:58,234 --> 01:03:59,895
You told that you got
a Dubai son-in-law.

837
01:04:00,036 --> 01:04:01,094
They gave a check to you.

838
01:04:01,204 --> 01:04:02,466
Go and commit suicide.

839
01:04:17,186 --> 01:04:19,120
Leave it man.
Let her die.

840
01:04:24,293 --> 01:04:26,727
- You damn it!
- Who are you? -Sir, leave me.

841
01:04:26,996 --> 01:04:29,692
Here is a big problem.
Sir listen to me.

842
01:04:29,932 --> 01:04:32,093
- Should I die?
- Leave him.

843
01:04:33,336 --> 01:04:34,268
Die off.

844
01:04:35,004 --> 01:04:36,494
- Leave me.
- Please take care of Myna.

845
01:04:36,606 --> 01:04:42,238
Are you calling me for help?
You damn girl, do you want to marry him?

846
01:04:42,445 --> 01:04:43,639
Do you want to stay in my home?

847
01:04:43,779 --> 01:04:47,010
My anger will reduce,
only if I beat and kill you.

848
01:04:47,149 --> 01:04:49,344
You sinner, die off.

849
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:51,682
Leave my hand.
Leave me man.

850
01:04:51,821 --> 01:04:56,349
- Don't leave her, beat.
- Come Myna.

851
01:04:57,293 --> 01:04:58,225
Where are you going?

852
01:04:58,361 --> 01:05:00,625

Get lost.
I'll do the funeral for you.

857
01:05:09,138 --> 01:05:11,072
You have eloped with him, isn't it?
You won't prosper.

858
01:05:11,173 --> 01:05:14,404
You will be ruined You'll die.

859
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:33,289
Stop the vehicle.

860
01:05:34,330 --> 01:05:35,319
- Stop it man.

861
01:05:35,431 --> 01:05:38,525
- Ramaiah bring him.

- Get in.
- Get in.

863
01:05:42,638 --> 01:05:44,697
Get inside Move aside.

Start the vehicle Go..

865
01:06:19,241 --> 01:06:20,833
You'll go to jail in a few hours.

866
01:06:22,078 --> 01:06:24,171
Where will you make her stay?

867
01:06:28,617 --> 01:06:31,279
Don't get panic
God will take care of us.

868
01:06:42,131 --> 01:06:44,998
INTERMISSION

869
01:06:56,679 --> 01:06:58,146
Somehow you will come out.

870
01:06:58,581 --> 01:07:00,981
Won't I get a place to stay
till you come?

871
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:02,578
They should come..

872
01:07:02,918 --> 01:07:07,287
The people who abused us should come
to our house seeking help.

873
01:07:07,656 --> 01:07:09,851
They should see our happy life.

874
01:07:10,993 --> 01:07:13,018
What is the price of 1 sweet Paniyaram?

875
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:14,852
1 rupee.

876
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:18,360
How many sweets
will come for one plate?

01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:21,692
40 pieces

878
01:07:22,204 --> 01:07:24,764
40 pieces..
If we sell 10 plates per day..

879
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:26,065
We will get 400 rupees

880
01:07:26,575 --> 01:07:28,634
I know to prepare spicy snacks too.

881
01:07:29,612 --> 01:07:31,603
Yes, I forgot that.

882
01:07:31,814 --> 01:07:34,146
So totally 800800 per day..

883
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:36,878
800 per day means
24,000 per month. What's bothering you?

884
01:07:36,986 --> 01:07:39,284
He is calculating well.

What is this? See, how she is laughing.
I am making her happy.

889
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:07,743
Should you mess up my face
to make her happy?

890
01:08:07,850 --> 01:08:10,546
- Is this a grinder?
- Yes, it seems like that only.

891
01:08:17,693 --> 01:08:22,027
You and I, earth and sky..

892
01:08:22,131 --> 01:08:25,794
Would happen what we dream.

893
01:08:26,435 --> 01:08:30,804
Blowing wind, cooing cuckoo..

894
01:08:30,906 --> 01:08:34,467
Would get what we need.

895
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:40,845
If it happens
I'll convey my thanks to the sky.

896
01:08:41,217 --> 01:08:47,645
If we get, I'll bring some stars down.

897
01:08:47,756 --> 01:08:54,756
Thousands of relations are there
No worries.

898
01:08:56,298 --> 01:09:03,298
Thousands of doors will open for us.

899
01:09:05,708 --> 01:09:12,708
No need to teach the birds to fly.

900
01:09:14,550 --> 01:09:18,748
You and I, earth and sky..

901
01:09:18,854 --> 01:09:23,120

Would get what we need.

904
01:10:04,033 --> 01:10:08,595
Our dream has become true.

905
01:10:08,704 --> 01:10:12,902
How should I thank the God?

906
01:10:13,008 --> 01:10:20,008
We got what we need
Let's live our life happily.

907
01:10:22,184 --> 01:10:29,184
If we have a little desire
It'll help to live a long life.

908
01:10:30,426 --> 01:10:34,692
No trouble in the life.

909
01:10:34,797 --> 01:10:39,632
It's enough if you think it.

910
01:10:39,735 --> 01:10:43,933
You and I, earth and sky..

911
01:10:44,039 --> 01:10:48,339
Would happen what we dream.

912
01:10:48,444 --> 01:10:52,642
You and I..

913
01:10:54,984 --> 01:10:56,281
MYNA
SWEET STALL

914
01:11:25,047 --> 01:11:29,381
It was a poor life which we lived.

915
01:11:29,518 --> 01:11:33,784
It has turned out rich now!

916
01:11:33,889 --> 01:11:38,087
We've known the secret
to rotate this world.

917
01:11:38,193 --> 01:11:42,960
The secret is known now.

918
01:11:43,065 --> 01:11:50,065
Love only could change us
and take us to a height.

919
01:11:51,206 --> 01:11:55,643
Listen! Life is full of flowers.

920
01:11:55,744 --> 01:12:00,374
It is blissful for us.

921
01:12:00,482 --> 01:12:04,816
You and I, earth and sky..

922
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:09,220
Would happen what we dream.

923
01:12:09,325 --> 01:12:13,591
Blowing wind, Cooing cuckoo

924
01:12:13,696 --> 01:12:17,359
we got what we need.

925
01:12:17,466 --> 01:12:24,466
Thousands of relations are there
No worries.

926
01:12:26,575 --> 01:12:33,575
Thousands of doors will open for us
No restrictions.

927
01:12:35,551 --> 01:12:42,551
No need to teach the birds to fly.

928
01:12:44,126 --> 01:12:48,529
You and I, earth and sky..

929
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:53,192
Would happen what we think.

930
01:13:01,810 --> 01:13:04,310
Suruli, if we come up in life
within 3 minutes song..

931
01:13:07,716 --> 01:13:08,774
How will it be?

932
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:13,310
It will be punctured like this only

933
01:13:13,422 --> 01:13:15,049
I am toiling for the past 30 years..

934
01:13:15,157 --> 01:13:16,647
But I couldn't buy
more than 3 underwears.

935
01:13:16,659 --> 01:13:18,292
There is one without elastic
in those 3 underwears.

936
01:13:18,293 --> 01:13:19,920
It wouldn't stay and falls down
when I wear that.

937
01:13:20,028 --> 01:13:21,655
Do you want to come up
in a 3 minute song?

938
01:13:21,764 --> 01:13:23,322
Don't you have the limit
for your dream?

939
01:13:23,432 --> 01:13:26,060
Where have you started?
Won't you repair this puncture?

940
01:13:26,168 --> 01:13:27,294
Driver, I am asking you only

941
01:13:27,403 --> 01:13:30,372
I am managing with this waste tire
for the past 5 years. -What, waste tire?

942
01:13:30,472 --> 01:13:32,167
Driver don't you have the stepney?
MORNING -9:00 AM

943
01:13:32,274 --> 01:13:33,832
I have to get from Podi Mettu only.

944
01:13:33,942 --> 01:13:35,807
Where are you going in this jungle?

945
01:13:35,911 --> 01:13:38,311
If we go in this route we will
reach Kurangani within half an hour.

946
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:40,746
Don't think and come with me. We will
go in a short route. -Short route?

947
01:13:41,116 --> 01:13:42,413
Come.

948
01:13:43,152 --> 01:13:45,313
- Get down.
- Get down.

949
01:13:48,991 --> 01:13:49,980
Get down man.

950
01:13:59,067 --> 01:14:00,091
Careful Myna.

951
01:14:00,903 --> 01:14:01,892
Get up, careful.

952
01:14:03,472 --> 01:14:05,235
- Did you get hurt?
- Nothing. I am alright.

953
01:14:05,974 --> 01:14:07,805
Wait a moment.

954
01:14:07,976 --> 01:14:08,943
Where is your bindi?

955
01:14:10,646 --> 01:14:11,772
It might have fallen down somewhere.

956
01:14:12,014 --> 01:14:13,146
Are you going to search the bindi?

957
01:14:13,181 --> 01:14:14,207
She likes bindi much.

958
01:14:14,316 --> 01:14:17,149
Didn't it look little over for you?
Is this her mother's gift?

959
01:14:17,386 --> 01:14:19,718
Come let's go Damn gift.

960
01:14:19,822 --> 01:14:21,119
She is not a mother She is a devil.

961
01:14:21,223 --> 01:14:22,918
We don't want their support.

962
01:14:23,025 --> 01:14:24,993
We shouldn't allow them to come home.

963
01:14:25,194 --> 01:14:27,856
He wants to marry this girl
But won't allow her mother to come.

964
01:14:28,530 --> 01:14:30,930
He loves her daughter
but hates her mother.

965
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:33,900
She wouldn't have come to this world
without her mother.

966
01:14:34,169 --> 01:14:35,500
Why are they running...?

967
01:14:35,904 --> 01:14:37,269
Cat...!

968
01:14:37,639 --> 01:14:38,503
No elephant.

969
01:14:40,075 --> 01:14:41,565
Run..

970
01:15:19,748 --> 01:15:21,875
Don't get scared It's me sir.

971
01:15:22,251 --> 01:15:24,014
Why do you put your
hands like a trunk?

972
01:15:24,119 --> 01:15:25,143
Is your life so valuable?

973
01:15:25,254 --> 01:15:27,017
Don't irritate me, you idiot!

974
01:15:27,189 --> 01:15:32,149
On Deepavali festival people will
blast elephant crackers

975
01:15:32,261 --> 01:15:34,593
but here Elephants are
blasting our hearts.

976
01:15:35,264 --> 01:15:36,891
Our officer is not seen
Where will be he?

977
01:15:37,432 --> 01:15:42,335
Don't know where he lays down dead
instead enjoying the Deepavali.

978
01:16:08,263 --> 01:16:09,890
Why do you yell?

979
01:16:17,239 --> 01:16:18,536
What are you thinking?

980
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:20,904
Something else may come.
Come, let's vacate the place.

981
01:16:21,009 --> 01:16:22,440
- Stop there.
- We should go through this way.

982
01:16:22,444 --> 01:16:24,071
- Which route...? Sir!
- What?

983
01:16:24,212 --> 01:16:26,942
We would have been stamped
by the elephants in his shortcut route..

984
01:16:27,049 --> 01:16:29,517
Now he is trying to be caught
by cheetahs in this route.

985
01:16:29,618 --> 01:16:31,609
We are police we have to
find some route ourselves.

986
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:33,278
- Listen to me.
- Listen to me sir.

987
01:16:33,388 --> 01:16:35,356
- Just a minute.
- Come -Not there.

988
01:16:36,391 --> 01:16:37,949
- What are you doing sir?
- Why did you lay down?

989
01:16:41,530 --> 01:16:44,499
- Hey Ramaiah!
- Bad vibration, no use.

990
01:16:45,968 --> 01:16:46,866
Just a minute sir.

991
01:16:49,037 --> 01:16:52,564
- Ramaiah, what are you doing?
- No use. Get up.

992
01:16:53,709 --> 01:16:55,199
Don't irritate me.

993
01:16:58,847 --> 01:17:01,315
Wow..
Good.

994
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:03,543
- Are you mad?
- Good vibration.

995
01:17:03,952 --> 01:17:07,115
It shows human behavior very well.

996
01:17:07,289 --> 01:17:08,153
This is the route.

997
01:17:09,224 --> 01:17:10,156
How do you say?

998
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:13,144
Since 37 generations, in our district,

999
01:17:13,145 --> 01:17:14,827
there are only some
people in our house..

1000
01:17:14,930 --> 01:17:16,693
To find water spot to dig the well

1001
01:17:16,832 --> 01:17:20,199
I am coming from that generation,
can't I find the route?

1002
01:17:20,302 --> 01:17:21,792
This is the correct way Go.

1003
01:17:48,363 --> 01:17:51,924
- Look at her shy!
- Is this too?

1004
01:17:52,034 --> 01:17:55,697
You've told me that we've got a baby
What baby it is?

1005
01:17:57,406 --> 01:17:59,101
We should ask it to the accountant.

1006
01:17:59,207 --> 01:18:02,233
In the hospital,
he only took the baby first.

1007
01:18:02,344 --> 01:18:04,244
- Accountant!
- Who is the accountant?

1008
01:18:04,346 --> 01:18:05,574
- I am a cop.
- Let it be.

1009
01:18:05,714 --> 01:18:08,478
You've got the baby at first, isn't it?
Tell me what baby it is.

1010
01:18:08,784 --> 01:18:10,684
Do I look like a joker?

1011
01:18:10,786 --> 01:18:13,346
If I get angry,
I'll smash you. Come.

1012
01:18:15,157 --> 01:18:18,786
Let it be any baby Let's enjoy.

1013
01:18:18,894 --> 01:18:20,953
- You won't get a baby.
- No problem.

1014
01:18:21,063 --> 01:18:22,758
She is my baby and I am her baby.

1015
01:18:22,864 --> 01:18:24,092
We enjoy ourselves.

1016
01:18:24,199 --> 01:18:26,099
- You won't come good.
- No problem.

1017
01:18:26,201 --> 01:18:28,066
- Come fast. -We will enjoy.
- I can't bear it.

1018
01:18:28,170 --> 01:18:30,138
He is speaking movie dialogues.

1019
01:19:23,058 --> 01:19:25,390
Dear! You go a little forward.

1020
01:19:26,528 --> 01:19:27,961
Why do you send her alone?

1021
01:19:28,063 --> 01:19:29,826
- I want to spit.
- Do it.

1022
01:19:29,931 --> 01:19:31,694
- It is a big spit.
- What do you mean?

1023
01:19:31,833 --> 01:19:33,232
I want to urinate.

1024
01:19:33,335 --> 01:19:36,168
You've sent her away
And asking me to release the cuffs.

1025
01:19:36,271 --> 01:19:37,966
If I release it
you'll escape, isn't it?

1026
01:19:38,073 --> 01:19:39,768
- I am controlling it.

Is this a job?

1031
01:19:52,420 --> 01:19:56,550
For all these,
I'll take my revenge on you.

1032
01:21:34,522 --> 01:21:36,513
Could you tell me
which is the way to go to Theni?

1033
01:21:36,625 --> 01:21:38,957
Theni is there, not here.

1034
01:21:40,028 --> 01:21:41,518
Have you come the wrong way?

1035
01:21:42,964 --> 01:21:44,431
Haven't I told you already?

1036
01:21:44,966 --> 01:21:46,263
Look there!

1037
01:21:46,368 --> 01:21:49,303
It is Sevvangudi You are from there.

1038
01:21:49,571 --> 01:21:52,369
If you climb down,
you'll reach Kurangani.

1039
01:21:52,774 --> 01:21:56,835
If you go down that way
you'll reach Theni crossing Podi.

1040
01:21:56,945 --> 01:21:59,607
- Where we are now?
- Munnar top station,

1041
01:21:59,714 --> 01:22:00,942
- Kerala.
- Kerala?

1042
01:22:01,049 --> 01:22:04,985
Look! There is the territory code This
side Kerala and that side Tamil Nadu.

1043
01:22:05,086 --> 01:22:06,312
Is there any short way to go to Theni?

1044
01:22:06,321 --> 01:22:08,516
If you go this way to Theni,
it will get dark.

1045
01:22:08,623 --> 01:22:12,354
If you go this way, you'll reach
Munnar town through Mattupatti dam.

1046
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:15,361
Taking the bus from there,
you can reach Theni in 3 hours.

1047
01:22:16,298 --> 01:22:21,895
In the river shore side
two birds are flying.

1048
01:22:25,206 --> 01:22:26,969
Is your family finding the water spot?

1049
01:22:27,075 --> 01:22:28,565
It is a filthy family.

1050
01:22:28,677 --> 01:22:29,735
Why do you abuse my family?

1051
01:22:29,844 --> 01:22:31,709
How can be the chariot
and the water in one place?

1052
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:33,848
Vibration changes.

1053
01:22:33,982 --> 01:22:37,474
Now it is Kerala and
this is Tamil Nadu.

1054
01:22:37,585 --> 01:22:39,917
This is Tamil nadu and it is Kerala.

01:23:17,125 --> 01:23:18,183
Shut up.

1061
01:23:18,293 --> 01:23:19,726

01:23:19,828 --> 01:23:20,692
Give me the beedi.

1063

01:23:32,507 --> 01:23:37,069
You gave up, right? -Yes, but when I
was in the jail, I started to smoke.

1068
01:23:37,579 --> 01:23:38,807
Try to manage something.

1069
01:23:41,349 --> 01:23:42,976
Now the chillness is reducing.

1070
01:23:44,319 --> 01:23:46,947
Don't smoke yourself.
Give me a puff.

1071
01:23:47,689 --> 01:23:48,821

01:24:07,175 --> 01:24:08,870
Cop's mind is of different kind.

01:24:23,024 --> 01:24:24,252
What are they saying?

1080
01:24:24,559 --> 01:24:26,754
They're asking us to take
a photo of them. -Do it.

1081
01:24:26,861 --> 01:24:28,226
Are you going to take their photo?

1082
01:24:28,329 --> 01:24:30,229
They are tourist
but you are an accused.

1083
01:24:30,698 --> 01:24:33,292
If we help other's love
our love will grow itself.

1084
01:24:33,401 --> 01:24:34,629
You go and take it.

1085
01:25:00,628 --> 01:25:01,492
Shall I take it?

Can you take a photo of us?

1087
01:25:09,104 --> 01:25:09,968
Stay away.

1088
01:25:15,376 --> 01:25:17,207
Superb How is it?

1089
01:25:18,646 --> 01:25:21,376
Look! You are smiling like a beggar.

1090
01:25:21,483 --> 01:25:22,643

01:25:26,087 --> 01:25:29,750

Have you seen how he got humiliated?

1094
01:25:37,165 --> 01:25:38,097
Why do you laugh?

1095
01:25:38,199 --> 01:25:39,359
You were humiliated.

1096
01:25:39,467 --> 01:25:41,731
- Who got humiliated?
- Do you know who is going? -Who?

1097
01:25:41,836 --> 01:25:43,303
He was born to me
without his knowledge.

1098
01:25:43,438 --> 01:25:45,531
So he got tense Understand it.

1099
01:25:46,474 --> 01:25:47,871
Until he is buried,
he'll manage like this.

1100
01:25:47,876 --> 01:25:49,241
Come without chatting with him.

1101
01:25:49,344 --> 01:25:50,834
Don't scold me.
Why do you scold me?

1102
01:25:50,945 --> 01:25:52,139
You are just walking.

1103
01:25:52,247 --> 01:25:54,374
But I am bringing the luggage Go sir!

1104
01:25:54,482 --> 01:25:57,178
Look Myna! No one stopped
the car for his request.

1105
01:25:57,285 --> 01:25:58,616
Now see how I stop the car.

1106
01:25:58,953 --> 01:26:02,184
- Don't bring the trouble.
- Keep quiet.

1107
01:26:02,423 --> 01:26:03,287

How dare you ask lift
by showing your leg?

1109
01:26:13,067 --> 01:26:15,467
When I asked lift with hand,
no one stopped.

1110
01:26:15,570 --> 01:26:16,662
Do you know what vehicle this is?

1111

Let's book a room and..

1126

Honeymoon?

1127
01:27:32,413 --> 01:27:35,439
Then, I won't roam around
here idle like you.

1128
01:27:35,550 --> 01:27:38,144
- Am I roaming idle here?
- Yes.

1129
01:27:38,253 --> 01:27:40,244
Have you thought
that I am a tourist guide?

1130
01:27:40,555 --> 01:27:41,783
This is my duty.

1131
01:27:43,224 --> 01:27:46,853
In this festival day, there is no
tooth powder to clean my mouth.

1132
01:27:46,961 --> 01:27:49,486
- It is my finger.
- Don't stretch your finger.

1133
01:27:49,597 --> 01:27:52,225
When did I stretch my finger?
Since morning I gave my hand to you.

1134
01:27:52,333 --> 01:27:53,960
- Come, let's go.
- Correct my hair style.

1135
01:27:54,068 --> 01:27:55,501
It hangs like thread.

1136
01:27:55,670 --> 01:27:58,070
Correct the hair style and
take her to the wedding dais

1137
01:27:58,172 --> 01:27:59,730
I won't call you as groom's mate.

1138
01:27:59,841 --> 01:28:01,069
Need that too.

1139
01:28:01,175 --> 01:28:02,665
You are going to the jail.
Stop the nonsense.

1140
01:28:02,777 --> 01:28:05,268
Come. -Don't pull me.
Turn this side.

1141
01:28:05,380 --> 01:28:07,075
Don't know what training you had?

1142
01:28:07,315 --> 01:28:08,873
- Is there any training for this?
- Go.

1143
01:28:08,983 --> 01:28:10,416
We feel hungry Come dear!

1144
01:28:16,658 --> 01:28:19,821
What do you want? -Don't bring
the water inserting your fingers.

1145
01:28:19,927 --> 01:28:21,189
Go and bring the water bottle.

1146
01:28:21,329 --> 01:28:25,095
Escort allowance for
one day is only 100 rupees.

1147
01:28:25,199 --> 01:28:26,757
You are asking him to bring
the water bottle.

1148
01:28:30,004 --> 01:28:33,565
Let it be the court or the hotel we'll
give the order. -What is there to eat?

1149
01:28:33,675 --> 01:28:35,540
That's we have the name as
law and order. -Wait a minute.

1150
01:28:36,010 --> 01:28:37,204
Don't break it.

1151
01:28:37,312 --> 01:28:38,870
Don't see accounts for this

1152
01:28:39,147 --> 01:28:42,207
I've never bought a water bottle
for Senthamarai. -Take it and you drink.

1153
01:29:07,608 --> 01:29:08,666
Sir is watching us.

1154
01:29:09,911 --> 01:29:13,074
Don't bother about him
You're going to say that let's enjoy.

1155
01:29:13,448 --> 01:29:15,848
Let's enjoy, isn't it?

1156
01:29:21,322 --> 01:29:24,621
- How can you be happy?
- Nothing like that sir.

1157
01:29:24,726 --> 01:29:25,715
What do you want to have sir?

1158
01:29:25,827 --> 01:29:28,159
- 4 meals -Anything else.
- No. -2 chicken for us.

1159
01:29:28,963 --> 01:29:30,954
- No sir, we feel very tired sir.
- Shut up.

1160
01:29:31,065 --> 01:29:33,397
- What is this?
- Today is Deepavali.

1161
01:29:33,901 --> 01:29:35,835
- Keep quiet.
- Are you with your family?

1162
01:29:35,937 --> 01:29:37,962
After marriage it is my first Deepavali
Could I go there?

1163
01:29:38,239 --> 01:29:40,400
5 police families are very tense.

1164
01:29:40,508 --> 01:29:43,272
He isn't listening to me sir
No sir. -Shut up.

1165
01:29:44,479 --> 01:29:47,243
- How can you enjoy?
- Who is enjoying?

1166
01:29:47,348 --> 01:29:48,975
In the morning,
you handed over him to me..

1167
01:29:49,083 --> 01:29:51,051
And walked keeping 10 feet distance
like a military officer.

1168
01:29:51,185 --> 01:29:53,483
Did you see behind you at least
once what was happening?

1169
01:29:53,621 --> 01:29:55,248
On the way
he is speaking ill language.

1170
01:29:55,356 --> 01:29:56,789
And giving her wrong signals.

1171
01:29:57,158 --> 01:29:59,956
Did you know how he played with
my hand since morning?

1172
01:30:00,094 --> 01:30:01,994
I feel irritated with my hand.

1173
01:30:02,096 --> 01:30:04,929
If there is life for this hand,
it'll commit suicide.

1174
01:30:05,566 --> 01:30:07,898
He is teasing me like
an accountant, shopkeeper.

1175
01:30:08,002 --> 01:30:11,529
Talking of their marriage
and begetting kids.

1176
01:30:11,639 --> 01:30:12,901
He teased me too much.

1177
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:16,271
You are insulting me in front of him.

1178
01:30:16,377 --> 01:30:17,435
Who is enjoying?

1179
01:30:17,678 --> 01:30:20,772
My wife is there with tears in eyes
Whole town is celebrating

1180
01:30:20,882 --> 01:30:23,510
I can't celebrate Deepavali.
My..

1181
01:30:23,618 --> 01:30:25,108
Why do you get emotional now?

1182
01:30:25,353 --> 01:30:27,378
He'll go to jail in a little while.

1183
01:30:27,588 --> 01:30:29,886
She'll roam like a beggar
in Periyakulam bus stand.

1184
01:30:30,024 --> 01:30:32,686
- Without shame, they are eating.
- You eat -Who will beg?

1185
01:30:32,794 --> 01:30:34,284
We'll get married after
my release tomorrow

1186
01:30:34,395 --> 01:30:35,885
I'll inform the place
You can come and dine.

1187
01:30:35,997 --> 01:30:38,898
What did you tell me?
You would come out tomorrow..

1188
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:42,936
We would send you bidding good bye..

1189
01:30:43,304 --> 01:30:46,671
You would invite us and

01:42:38,585 --> 01:42:39,950
If you have guts, beat me.

1350
01:42:40,053 --> 01:42:41,350
You are pulling a girl down.

1351
01:42:41,455 --> 01:42:44,253

and don't bother about us?

1360
01:43:02,109 --> 01:43:03,337
What wrong did we do?

1361
01:43:03,710 --> 01:43:05,268
Shut up.

1362
01:43:05,412 --> 01:43:06,744
Can you justify your
escape from the jail?

1363
01:43:06,746 --> 01:43:07,708
- Why did I escape?
- Why?

1364
01:43:07,848 --> 01:43:09,679
I came believing you
that you'll release me tomorrow.

1365
01:43:09,783 --> 01:43:11,910
But he said he'll send me to
jail framing false charges.

1366
01:43:12,019 --> 01:43:13,646
That's why I escaped

1367
01:43:13,954 --> 01:43:16,149
I've brought up her like a flower
since her childhood.

1368
01:43:16,256 --> 01:43:18,281
He is pulling her down like a dog.

1369
01:43:18,692 --> 01:43:21,160
No one likes us in our place
Now you too don't like us.

1370
01:43:21,261 --> 01:43:24,753
Since childhood her mom
told that she is mine.

1371
01:43:24,898 --> 01:43:26,565
But she tried to get her
married to someone else.

1372
01:43:26,967 --> 01:43:28,662
That's why I tried to
hit her with a stone.

1373
01:43:28,936 --> 01:43:30,631
That's why you arrested me.

1374
01:43:30,737 --> 01:43:32,564
When I heard about her marriage,
I escaped from the jail.

1375
01:43:32,572 --> 01:43:33,837
What wrong did I do?

1376
01:43:33,941 --> 01:43:36,273
Tell me sir
Did I kill anyone or rob anything?

1377
01:43:36,376 --> 01:43:38,207
I loved her Is it wrong?

1378
01:43:38,745 --> 01:43:41,145
I didn't go after the money.

1379
01:43:41,248 --> 01:43:42,875
My Myna is enough for me.

1380
01:43:43,317 --> 01:43:44,944
Are you playing a drama?

1381
01:43:45,085 --> 01:43:47,553
Why sir again and again.. -He is telling
a story and you're listening to it

1382
01:43:47,854 --> 01:43:50,448
I'll take you and file you
in a police encounter.

1383
01:43:50,557 --> 01:43:53,025
Do you have that plan too?

1384
01:43:53,126 --> 01:43:54,523
I can't come with you
believing your words.

1385
01:43:54,528 --> 01:43:57,224
Like he said in the hotel,
inform the local police.

1386
01:43:57,331 --> 01:43:59,925
Let they come and take me
I'll surrender to them.

1387
01:44:00,033 --> 01:44:01,796
Sit down dear!

1388
01:44:01,902 --> 01:44:03,893
Look sir! I didn't do any wrong.

1389
01:44:04,004 --> 01:44:06,404
He says that he'll frame false
charges kill me in a police encounter.

1390
01:44:06,506 --> 01:44:07,734
You just question them.

1391
01:44:07,841 --> 01:44:10,366
- Police down with.
- He has become alert.

1392
01:44:10,477 --> 01:44:12,104
He talks about local police
and surrender.

1393
01:44:12,212 --> 01:44:13,577
Public is watching us.

1394
01:44:13,680 --> 01:44:14,738
Please listen to me!

1395
01:44:14,848 --> 01:44:16,782
If you don't control your emotion now,

1396
01:44:16,917 --> 01:44:20,250
all over India, all TV channels
will insult our department.

1397
01:44:20,354 --> 01:44:21,981
- Police down with.
- Stop it.

1398
01:44:22,089 --> 01:44:23,181
Sir! Call the local police.

1399
01:44:23,690 --> 01:44:25,317
- Sir! Call the local police.
- Just listen to me.

1400
01:44:25,425 --> 01:44:26,449
Let me see how he shoots me.

1401
01:44:27,261 --> 01:44:28,819
If he said so,
would he shoot you in real?

1402
01:44:28,929 --> 01:44:30,487
Would you die?
Or would I leave you alone?

1403
01:44:30,597 --> 01:44:32,087
- I am like your brother.
- You?

1404
01:44:32,199 --> 01:44:34,724
Ok, I am like your uncle.
I'll arrange for a bail.

1405
01:44:34,835 --> 01:44:36,200
You'll come out.

1406
01:44:36,303 --> 01:44:38,965
Then I'll conduct your marriage.

1407
01:44:39,139 --> 01:44:42,597
Ok? After your marriage, you'll
beget children and enjoy your life.

1408
01:44:42,709 --> 01:44:44,142
Why do you want to request him?

1409
01:44:44,244 --> 01:44:46,212
- Why do you get emotional?
- Leave me.

1410
01:44:46,380 --> 01:44:48,245
Who pleased him?
I didn't

1411
01:44:49,883 --> 01:44:50,872
I am just acting

1412
01:44:50,984 --> 01:44:53,782
I am just looking like that
but not mad guy

1413
01:44:53,920 --> 01:44:57,549
I accompanied him all the way to here
Do you want me to waste it?

1414
01:44:57,658 --> 01:45:01,389
In my 35 years service, this accused
has made me to call him sir.

1415
01:45:01,495 --> 01:45:02,928
Have you got humiliated more than this?

1416
01:45:03,163 --> 01:45:06,826
I have more anger on him than you.

1417
01:45:06,933 --> 01:45:09,401
Please understand me.

1418
01:45:09,636 --> 01:45:13,367
Let's take him to jail,
poison his food and kill him.

1419
01:45:13,473 --> 01:45:16,135
He is subsiding now and
you too control your anger.

1420
01:45:18,945 --> 01:45:20,742
Listen to me!

1421
01:45:21,181 --> 01:45:22,944
What madam!
What have you decided?

1422
01:45:23,083 --> 01:45:24,015
What is he telling?

1423
01:45:24,384 --> 01:45:26,011
What Ramaiah sir says is right.

1424
01:45:26,119 --> 01:45:30,522
Let's not create a problem here.
Listen to me.

1425
01:45:30,624 --> 01:45:32,649
- Sir!
- Tell me brother!

1426
01:45:32,859 --> 01:45:35,089
Until now we were cheated
by everyone we believed.

1427
01:45:35,562 --> 01:45:36,859
At last we believe you.

1428
01:45:36,963 --> 01:45:39,431
You are a cop.
Do as you wish

1429
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:41,365
I won't cheat you.

1430
01:45:41,835 --> 01:45:44,099
Now we've become relatives
No need of respect

1431
01:45:44,204 --> 01:45:45,603
I am an officer to others.

1432
01:45:45,739 --> 01:45:47,832
But I am like your uncle.
Understand it

1433
01:45:48,075 --> 01:45:51,533

Why did you stop the auto
in front of the bus? Move fast.

Light up this.

1463
01:48:06,980 --> 01:48:08,140
Look at him.

1464
01:48:08,381 --> 01:48:11,475
Do you know who is he?

1465
01:48:11,852 --> 01:48:12,910

1466
01:48:13,053 --> 01:48:14,179
Do you know who am I?

1467
01:48:14,654 --> 01:48:16,178
How do I know, who you are?

1468
01:48:16,323 --> 01:48:18,985
Friend, he doesn't know who he is.

1469
01:48:19,092 --> 01:48:20,582
- We will find it.
- Yes, we will find it.

1470
01:48:21,461 --> 01:48:22,291
Sit down.

1471
01:48:24,231 --> 01:48:27,758
There is a reason for his anger
Do you know why?

1472
01:48:28,335 --> 01:48:29,632
That is anger corner.

1473
01:48:30,437 --> 01:48:33,338
There is a reason why
the conductor stands there.

1474
01:48:33,440 --> 01:48:34,498
Do you know why?

1475
01:48:35,308 --> 01:48:36,468
That is wealth corner.

1476
01:48:36,776 --> 01:48:40,212
There is a reason that you are
sitting in this corner without brain.

1477
01:48:40,313 --> 01:48:41,678
- Do you know why?
- You..

1478
01:48:41,848 --> 01:48:44,248
You fool! Rascal!

I will beat you with slippers.

1480
01:48:47,621 --> 01:48:50,454
Go. Move away and sit.

1481
01:48:50,624 --> 01:48:51,852
Idiot!

1482
01:48:59,099 --> 01:49:01,090
Happy Deepavali!

1483
01:49:01,201 --> 01:49:03,226
Greetings for all!

1484
01:49:03,336 --> 01:49:06,305
- Sir, greetings!
- Brother, don't you get crackers?

1485
01:49:06,740 --> 01:49:08,605
Sir,..

1486
01:49:08,708 --> 01:49:11,176
Happy Deepavali!

1487
01:49:12,345 --> 01:49:14,643
Do you know why
we are celebrating Deepavali?

1488
01:49:14,781 --> 01:49:17,375
- Will you shut up and go?
- Thank you very much.

1489
01:49:18,885 --> 01:49:20,648
Then don't you believe me?

1490
01:49:21,021 --> 01:49:23,785
The man said it is 71/2 crores
who are the owners of that place.

1491
01:49:24,024 --> 01:49:27,050
That party has accepted for 7 crores.

1492
01:49:27,294 --> 01:49:29,626
But that man does not accept
for less than 71/2 crores.

1493
01:49:29,996 --> 01:49:32,624
If he register the document
we will get 10 Iakhs profit

1494
01:49:32,732 --> 01:49:35,530
I thought we will get 50-50
but it has not happened.

1495
01:49:35,635 --> 01:49:37,626
What? Is the party
ready for 71/2 crores?

1496
01:49:37,737 --> 01:49:39,568
Tell his number.
Tell me.

1497
01:49:39,673 --> 01:49:41,300
Oh God! Where can I write?

1498
01:49:41,575 --> 01:49:44,237
Brother, do you have waste paper?

1499
01:49:44,344 --> 01:49:45,402
I have to write a number.

1500
01:49:45,545 --> 01:49:48,070
This place is free.
Write down many numbers.

1501
01:49:49,282 --> 01:49:52,649
Write down. I showed the place.
And built the flat..

1502
01:49:55,889 --> 01:49:58,790
- What is it a wrong number...?
- Who are you all?

1503
01:50:00,927 --> 01:50:03,589
Go sir. I have lost 5
Iakhs because of you.

1504
01:50:05,298 --> 01:50:06,788
Did you lose 5 Iakhs?

1505
01:50:06,900 --> 01:50:08,731
I am a real estate broker

1506
01:50:08,835 --> 01:50:11,531
I had to write a number urgently
but you didn't co-operate.

1507
01:50:11,638 --> 01:50:13,902
Tamil Nadu is going back only
because of people like you.

1508
01:50:14,074 --> 01:50:15,974
Is Tamil Nadu going back?

1509
01:50:16,076 --> 01:50:18,067
You fool! Is this my head
or something else?

1510
01:50:18,178 --> 01:50:20,146
- What are you thinking?
- Stop it man!

1511
01:50:20,246 --> 01:50:22,111
Why are you fighting for Deepavali?
Stop the fight.

1512
01:50:22,215 --> 01:50:25,013
- Sit down.
- Conductor, they won't stop the fight.

1513
01:50:25,118 --> 01:50:26,415
Ask driver to play the songs.

1514
01:50:26,519 --> 01:50:27,611
How can he play?

1515
01:50:27,721 --> 01:50:30,884
Yesterday a man like you took the boom
box telling I didn't give the change.

1516
01:50:37,797 --> 01:50:41,665
Wearing swaying ear rings
and filmy blouse..

1517
01:50:41,801 --> 01:50:44,929
Tell me where you are going

1518
01:50:45,071 --> 01:50:49,098
I'll accompany you
let's go for a walk.

1519
01:50:56,583 --> 01:51:00,144
Wearing swaying ear rings
and filmy blouse..

1520
01:51:00,286 --> 01:51:03,414
I'll go wherever I want to go

1521
01:51:03,556 --> 01:51:07,652
I don't want your company Stay away.

1522
01:51:15,368 --> 01:51:18,633
The place is muffed,
good thing is ruined

1523
01:51:18,772 --> 01:51:21,798
I'll come and guard you.

1524
01:51:21,975 --> 01:51:26,935
Don't refuse me, my sweet heart!

1525
01:51:48,334 --> 01:51:51,861
Rayanduru 3 miles Nanganeri 100 miles.

1526
01:51:52,005 --> 01:51:55,065
No need of dress in the evening.

1527
01:51:55,241 --> 01:51:59,439
If you remove it
You can wear it at dawn.

Seeranur 5 miles Chidambaram 50 miles.

1529
01:52:10,523 --> 01:52:13,549
You've been behind the bars in Vellore.

1530
01:52:13,727 --> 01:52:17,720
Forgetting it now trying to lure me.

1531

Sengipatti 9 miles
how far Singapore is?

1532
01:52:28,942 --> 01:52:32,036
Is there anyone who roamed
all these places?

1533
01:52:32,178 --> 01:52:36,376
I want to explore you,
come and join me.

Boodhalur 7 miles
Poondi Temple 4 miles.

Shall I hug you with love?

1536
01:53:05,445 --> 01:53:09,711
Or shall I become a saint?

1537
01:53:17,056 --> 01:53:20,492
Kumbakonam 6 miles Kulithalai 4 miles.

1538
01:53:20,693 --> 01:53:23,719
You haven't reformed
after getting beaten up in every town.

1539
01:53:23,930 --> 01:53:28,128
Your fiancee also hasn't respected you.

01:53:42,382 --> 01:53:48,378
Accept me and
play as your wish, my dame!

1543
01:54:26,993 --> 01:54:28,593
Oh God!

1544
01:54:51,517 --> 01:54:52,950

Climb carefully.

1548
01:55:21,748 --> 01:55:22,680
Climb carefully.

1549
01:55:32,525 --> 01:55:34,993
Brother, get me too
after you climb up.

1550
01:55:36,529 --> 01:55:38,622
- Hold me.
- Pull me!

1551
01:55:38,798 --> 01:55:39,787
Be careful!

1552
01:55:41,334 --> 01:55:42,961
Bus is falling down, hold me too.

1553
01:55:43,069 --> 01:55:44,536
- Give your hand.
- Yes brother!

1554
01:55:56,916 --> 01:55:57,940
Lift me.

1555
01:55:58,217 --> 01:55:59,684
- Sir, give your hand.
- Lift them.

1556
01:56:01,187 --> 01:56:03,018
Mariyappa, careful!
Slowly, careful!

1557
01:56:03,122 --> 01:56:04,146
Sir, careful.

1558
01:56:23,309 --> 01:56:24,901
Sir, be like that.
Don't move.

1559
01:56:25,111 --> 01:56:26,669
If you move, glass will break.

1560
01:56:30,183 --> 01:56:32,413
Suruli, save me.

1561
01:56:33,286 --> 01:56:34,480
Please save the sir.

1562
01:56:34,687 --> 01:56:36,882
Please get down. Please!

1563
01:56:42,362 --> 01:56:43,556
What did you say?

1564
01:56:44,097 --> 01:56:46,156
Will you kill me in jail
by poisoning my food?

1565
01:56:49,202 --> 01:56:51,363
Yes dear! They had planned like that.

1566
01:56:52,939 --> 01:56:56,636
Sir, we shouldn't decide
who will die first.

1567
01:57:02,448 --> 01:57:04,382
Baskar sir, go straight.

1568
01:57:04,517 --> 01:57:06,644
Many people are there.
You can play shooting.

1569
01:57:06,853 --> 01:57:08,650
- Bye.
- Come.

1570
01:57:08,888 --> 01:57:10,116
Is this time to take a revenge?

1571
01:57:10,323 --> 01:57:11,688
They are struggling for their lives.

1572
01:57:12,492 --> 01:57:14,460
Then, what is the difference
between them and us?

1573
01:57:15,028 --> 01:57:17,189
Poor guys! Help them to climb up.

1574
01:57:17,497 --> 01:57:18,987
Go and lift them up.

1575
01:57:24,937 --> 01:57:28,395
- Go and lift him.
- Sir, give me your hand.

1576
01:57:28,508 --> 01:57:31,068
Trust me, give your hand.
I won't betray you.

1577
01:57:41,554 --> 01:57:43,681
Careful! Hold this rod!

1578
01:57:45,792 --> 01:57:48,226
Go and lift him too.

1579
01:57:49,729 --> 01:57:50,627
Careful man!

1580
01:57:50,797 --> 01:57:53,163
Go carefully! Careful!

1581
01:57:53,366 --> 01:57:54,333
Careful!

1582
01:57:55,568 --> 01:57:58,537
- Sir, don't move.
- Baskar sir, wait. I'm coming.

1583
01:57:59,238 --> 01:58:01,229
Suruli, slowly and careful.

1584
01:58:01,741 --> 01:58:04,733
Sir, don't move.

1585
01:58:08,514 --> 01:58:09,503
Wait sir.

1586
01:58:13,686 --> 01:58:15,051
Don't be scared. Wait

1587
01:58:16,189 --> 01:58:17,087
I came.

1588
01:58:22,428 --> 01:58:25,295
Sir, give me your hand.

1589
01:58:26,899 --> 01:58:28,059
Give me your hand.

1590
01:58:32,605 --> 01:58:33,594
Careful!

1591
01:58:36,242 --> 01:58:39,109
Sir, give me your hand.

1592
01:59:02,635 --> 01:59:04,193
Suruli, careful.

1593
01:59:23,089 --> 01:59:25,421
Myna, you go and get down.

1594
01:59:26,893 --> 01:59:30,590
- You come.
- Suruli, come.

1595
01:59:32,865 --> 01:59:33,889
Sir, you climb up.

1596
01:59:34,367 --> 01:59:37,302
Sir, quickly.

1597
01:59:38,604 --> 01:59:40,333
Climb up sir.

1598
01:59:40,840 --> 01:59:41,932
Jump down.

1599
01:59:59,492 --> 02:00:00,356
Sir, are you alright?

1600
02:00:00,493 --> 02:00:03,223
- Suruli, are you alright?
- Yes, dear.

1601
02:00:03,996 --> 02:00:05,258
Did you get hurt?

1602
02:00:05,431 --> 02:00:09,128
Make him to get in.
Go inside. Make him sit.

1603
02:00:09,502 --> 02:00:10,526
Careful!

1604
02:00:11,337 --> 02:00:12,429
Go slowly.

1605
02:00:14,674 --> 02:00:17,074
- Sir, is anyone hurt?
- No one is hurt.

1606
02:00:17,243 --> 02:00:19,268
- The driver and conductor?
- They are alright.

1607
02:00:19,478 --> 02:00:21,639
Thank god! Money will come anytime.

1608
02:00:21,747 --> 02:00:23,045
But if we lose life,
will it come again?

1609
02:00:23,115 --> 02:00:27,275
Conductor, don't forget to give change.

1610
02:00:30,756 --> 02:00:33,350
Buddy, big problem has happened here.

1611
02:00:33,593 --> 02:00:37,154
You finish the deal for 7 crores. Yes.

1612
02:00:41,367 --> 02:00:42,493
Sir, did you get the bus?

1613
02:00:42,702 --> 02:00:45,500
- On the way..
- Give it to me.

1614
02:00:48,941 --> 02:00:51,375
- Tell me Murali.
- Will you reach before tonight?

1615
02:00:51,744 --> 02:00:52,972
We will be there in 2 hours.

1616
02:00:53,246 --> 02:00:55,180
Superintendent has called me 4-5 times.

1617
02:00:55,348 --> 02:00:57,282
You don't get tense.
We will come.

1618
02:00:59,685 --> 02:01:02,279
There is blood on your forehead.
Wipe it and put medicine.

1619
02:01:02,622 --> 02:01:03,748
It's nothing.

1620
02:01:04,357 --> 02:01:06,791
You should believe me.
Will I cut the call?

1621
02:01:07,059 --> 02:01:11,052
On the way our bus
met with a small accident.

1622
02:01:11,264 --> 02:01:13,198
Small accident?

1623
02:01:13,432 --> 02:01:15,366
Listen to me.

1624
02:01:15,568 --> 02:01:18,537
You got divorce for 11 times.
And I got divorce for 8 times.

1625
02:01:18,804 --> 02:01:20,801
Again if we go to court
to get the divorce

1626
02:01:20,802 --> 02:01:22,797
that judge will beat us with slippers

1627
02:01:23,309 --> 02:01:26,005
I said to cut the relationship
with Ramamurthy, you have cut it

1628
02:01:26,412 --> 02:01:28,937
I said to cut the relationship
with Sathyamurthy, you have cut it.

1629
02:01:29,048 --> 02:01:32,540
But why did you continue the
relationship with Krishnamurthy?

1630
02:01:33,052 --> 02:01:36,249
Dear, I have come out by believing you.

1631
02:01:36,756 --> 02:01:39,452
Thirty people have come there
before I have gone out for 3 days

1632
02:01:39,592 --> 02:01:43,995
I got the complaint.
I've some respect in our town.

1633
02:01:44,330 --> 02:01:47,197
You too have responsibility
to save my dignity. Isn't it?

1634
02:01:48,934 --> 02:01:50,026
Don't cry.

1635
02:01:50,303 --> 02:01:52,533
Don't cry dear.
If you cry, I will also cry

1636
02:01:52,905 --> 02:01:53,735
I understood.

1637
02:01:53,873 --> 02:01:55,568
If you can't stop fully..

1638
02:01:56,042 --> 02:01:58,033
Why don't you lessen 2 to 3 people?

1639
02:01:58,344 --> 02:01:59,777
What is the sound on the door?

1640
02:02:01,647 --> 02:02:02,841
Has Anand come?

1641
02:02:02,982 --> 02:02:05,416
Tell him to give the
missed call and come at this time.

1642
02:02:05,651 --> 02:02:08,051
We have a status in society. Isn't it?

1643
02:02:09,155 --> 02:02:11,919
Ok dear. Take care of your health.

1644
02:02:12,825 --> 02:02:14,520
Don't cut the line.

1645
02:02:16,796 --> 02:02:18,024
Did you get it?

1646
02:02:20,633 --> 02:02:22,760
Ok dear.
This is enough.

1647
02:02:23,269 --> 02:02:24,429
Take care of Anand.

1648
02:02:27,006 --> 02:02:28,735
It is correct, what I
talked to her, isn't it?

1649
02:02:29,108 --> 02:02:36,037
They have suffered for food those who
believe in dignity, respect and honesty.

1650
02:02:36,315 --> 02:02:39,910
You look like good for nothing
because you seem to be honest.

1651
02:02:40,152 --> 02:02:42,211
If you ignore it
you'll come up in life.

1652
02:02:44,690 --> 02:02:47,591
- What is your name?
- Kavarimaan Raja.

1653
02:02:48,260 --> 02:02:50,353
- You are not to be here.
- Then where I should be?

1654
02:02:50,963 --> 02:02:52,157
You shouldn't be alive.

1655
02:02:53,799 --> 02:02:55,323
Fool! This is the meaning.

1656
02:02:56,302 --> 02:02:57,735
How can a bus withstand guys like you?

1657
02:03:00,706 --> 02:03:03,038
They said the bus will stop here
for 10 minutes to drink tea.

1658
02:03:03,175 --> 02:03:05,439
We had our teas.
Where is the bus?

1659
02:03:05,845 --> 02:03:08,541
Tell me uncle. Tell me.

1660
02:03:08,948 --> 02:03:11,109
- We are in the bus.
- Then, my seat?

1661
02:03:11,317 --> 02:03:12,750
Your seat is there.
Go and sit there.

1662
02:03:13,786 --> 02:03:15,219
Is this bus?

1663
02:03:15,488 --> 02:03:16,819
Is that the seat?

1664
02:03:17,390 --> 02:03:20,917
- Why are you drinking in the morning?
- You fool!

1665
02:03:22,795 --> 02:03:24,558
Evening 4:15 pm.

1666
02:03:24,663 --> 02:03:27,097
What Senthamarai?
Just now you spoke to me.

1667
02:03:27,366 --> 02:03:29,061
Then, why did you.. Listen to me.

1668
02:03:29,201 --> 02:03:30,463
Nothing happen to me

1669
02:03:30,936 --> 02:03:32,904
I will come to Periyakulam
bus stand within 2 hours.

1670
02:03:33,205 --> 02:03:35,503
No one is hurt.
Then what?

1671
02:03:37,910 --> 02:03:39,275
Is it paining for you?

1672
02:03:46,485 --> 02:03:49,454
What is this sir?
Baskar sir, look at him.

1673
02:03:52,892 --> 02:03:54,325
Sir, you too..

1674
02:03:54,593 --> 02:03:56,561
Sir, we will enjoy..

1675
02:03:57,530 --> 02:03:59,327
Sorry sir.
I was excited..

1676
02:03:59,932 --> 02:04:01,126
It's ok Suruli.

1677
02:04:01,801 --> 02:04:05,237
He is happy.
Why are you looking dull?

1678
02:04:16,081 --> 02:04:20,381
Hold my hand look at me.

1679
02:04:20,886 --> 02:04:25,255
Hold your breath to the heart.

1680
02:04:25,624 --> 02:04:29,856
Smile a little just walk.

1681
02:04:30,429 --> 02:04:34,365
Now sleep on my shoulder.

1682
02:04:34,500 --> 02:04:39,233
Sing something softly.

1683
02:04:39,371 --> 02:04:44,104
Burden will disappear like fog.

1684
02:04:44,210 --> 02:04:48,579
Hereafter..

1685
02:04:48,981 --> 02:04:53,577
Speak to me from your heart.
The burden will reduce.

1686
02:04:53,786 --> 02:04:58,849
With the love not being separated
let's live together.

1687
02:05:02,361 --> 02:05:03,293
What are you doing?

1688
02:05:04,363 --> 02:05:05,227
You may fall down.

1689
02:05:06,532 --> 02:05:07,362
No.

1690
02:05:08,901 --> 02:05:11,301
- Suruli!
- Hey brother!

1691
02:05:27,620 --> 02:05:30,316
- What dear! Will I leave you alone?
- You rascal! You nasty!

1692
02:05:30,656 --> 02:05:32,317
- Leave him dear!
- You rogue!

1693
02:05:45,237 --> 02:05:49,537
Hold my hand look at me.

1694
02:05:50,109 --> 02:05:54,205
Hold your breath to the heart.

1695
02:05:54,880 --> 02:05:59,214
Smile a little just walk.

1696
02:05:59,618 --> 02:06:03,520
Now sleep on my shoulder.

1697
02:06:03,689 --> 02:06:08,285
Sing slowly something.

1698
02:06:08,494 --> 02:06:13,158
Burden will disappear like fog.

1699
02:06:13,299 --> 02:06:17,827
Hereafter..

1700
02:06:18,871 --> 02:06:23,501
No happiness without you.

1701
02:06:23,642 --> 02:06:27,908
You have filled in my heart.

1702
02:06:28,113 --> 02:06:30,343
When I think about you, no hunger.

1703
02:06:30,516 --> 02:06:32,780
No sleep in the night.

1704
02:06:32,952 --> 02:06:35,216
Don't like anything until comes dawn.

1705
02:06:35,354 --> 02:06:37,549
It is a puzzle can't find the answer

1706
02:06:37,756 --> 02:06:40,657
I don't know why

1707
02:06:42,561 --> 02:06:44,756
I don't feel chillness in the heavy rain

1708
02:06:44,930 --> 02:06:47,228
I don't feel the heat
in the scorching sun.

1709
02:06:47,366 --> 02:06:49,630
Can't find a way to forget you.

1710
02:06:49,802 --> 02:06:52,066
Don't know till where it goes

1711
02:06:52,204 --> 02:06:55,105
but I don't know why.

1712
02:06:56,609 --> 02:07:01,239
It is the river that joins the sea.

1713
02:07:01,380 --> 02:07:06,079
After you related to me
you became my life.

1714
02:07:06,218 --> 02:07:10,552
In this earth..

1715
02:07:12,958 --> 02:07:13,822
POOPARAI

1716
02:07:35,047 --> 02:07:37,072
PODI METTU
EVENING 5:15 pm.

1717
02:07:47,459 --> 02:07:49,689
It is a wonder in the world.

1718
02:07:49,828 --> 02:07:52,023
No secret other than you.

1719
02:07:52,231 --> 02:07:56,964
When breeze often touches me..
My thoughts come and caress me

1720
02:07:57,069 --> 02:08:00,129
I don't know why.

1721
02:08:01,440 --> 02:08:06,036
Why the mind has become
so naughty full?

1722
02:08:06,278 --> 02:08:11,181
Our age provokes us
to make the mistake.

1723
02:08:21,427 --> 02:08:23,657
Hold my hand!

1724
02:08:31,103 --> 02:08:34,368
Hold my hand!

1725
02:08:37,876 --> 02:08:39,969
PERIYAKULAM,
TIME -7:30 pm.

1726
02:08:51,724 --> 02:08:52,850
Tell me, what is it?

1727
02:08:53,692 --> 02:08:55,956
We are alright.
We came back safely.

1728
02:08:57,062 --> 02:08:59,121
We've reached Periyakulam
bus stop itself.

1729
02:09:00,866 --> 02:09:03,858
Sir, my wife is in line
She isn't believing me.

1730
02:09:03,969 --> 02:09:06,233
- Talk with her.
- I am Baskar.

1731
02:09:08,040 --> 02:09:09,405
We came back safely.

1732
02:09:10,342 --> 02:09:11,832
Just a minute, Let me give him.

1733
02:09:13,178 --> 02:09:15,442
Did you talk with him?
Do you believe me now?

1734
02:09:16,949 --> 02:09:19,008
The boy who saved us
is standing nearby.

1735
02:09:21,653 --> 02:09:23,848
That girl too standing with us.

1736
02:09:25,190 --> 02:09:26,418
Do you want to talk with him?

1737
02:09:26,592 --> 02:09:29,186
Suruli, my wife wants to talk with you.

1738
02:09:30,829 --> 02:09:31,921
Mom...!

1739
02:09:37,236 --> 02:09:38,464
Mom.

1740
02:09:38,771 --> 02:09:40,500
She is not talking.

1741
02:09:42,841 --> 02:09:46,937
Don't cry, dear.

1742
02:09:48,881 --> 02:09:51,611
She doesn't have any
sisters and brothers.

1743
02:09:51,884 --> 02:09:54,512
And no children too
God has penalised her.

1744
02:09:54,820 --> 02:09:56,947
She will become emotional,
if anybody calls her as sister.

1745
02:09:57,156 --> 02:09:59,124
You called her as mom
That's why she cried.

1746
02:10:05,664 --> 02:10:07,825
Look, stop crying

1747
02:10:08,100 --> 02:10:10,034
I will produce him in
the court tomorrow morning..

1748
02:10:10,269 --> 02:10:11,497
And going to take him out in bail

1749
02:10:11,904 --> 02:10:13,269
I will bring them home.

1750
02:10:13,539 --> 02:10:17,771
We are going to protect them
from all the troubles.

1751
02:10:24,082 --> 02:10:26,482
We only are going to perform
their marriage

1752
02:10:29,454 --> 02:10:32,685
I will tell you the other details in
the morning when I see you in person.

1753
02:10:32,858 --> 02:10:34,826
- I'll come in the morning.
- Give it to me.

1754
02:10:36,595 --> 02:10:37,892
You don't bother

1755
02:10:38,697 --> 02:10:40,358
I'll send him home right away.

1756
02:10:41,800 --> 02:10:42,630
You start to home.

1757
02:10:42,868 --> 02:10:44,358
Sir let me remand him..

1758
02:10:44,570 --> 02:10:46,037
And take Myna to my home.

1759
02:10:46,939 --> 02:10:49,499
Go home first and meet your wife

1760
02:10:49,975 --> 02:10:51,567
I will take care of them.

1761
02:10:51,710 --> 02:10:53,940
- No sir, I..
- I will take care, you can go.

1762
02:10:54,146 --> 02:10:55,704
- Ok sir.
- Take my bike.

1763
02:10:56,014 --> 02:10:58,141
Go home safely
I will take care of them.

1764
02:10:58,517 --> 02:10:59,484
- Start.
- Ok sir.

1765
02:10:59,751 --> 02:11:02,481
- Get in Suruli.
- Go carefully, sir

1766
02:11:23,709 --> 02:11:25,540
I'll leave him and come.
You wait here.

1767
02:11:25,744 --> 02:11:26,836
Come Suruli

1768
02:11:35,220 --> 02:11:36,915
I will come in the morning.
I'll be fine.

1769
02:11:37,656 --> 02:11:38,782
Nothing will happen to me.

1770
02:11:39,625 --> 02:11:40,956
Don't panic.

1771
02:11:55,107 --> 02:11:57,200
- Damn it!
- What sir?

1772
02:12:02,514 --> 02:12:05,244
- Leave him, Murali.
- Leave him sir.

1773
02:12:06,718 --> 02:12:09,243
Tell him that I became your friend.

1774
02:12:10,289 --> 02:12:11,517
Wait, Suruli.

1775
02:12:14,159 --> 02:12:17,287
You beggar, you made us to suffer
in festival time.

1776
02:12:17,462 --> 02:12:18,656
You won't prosper.

1777
02:12:18,797 --> 02:12:21,630
- I'll pay back nicely.
- I am telling you. Be calm.

1778
02:12:24,569 --> 02:12:26,503
Why are they beating me?

1779
02:12:28,840 --> 02:12:29,829
Is it paining?

1780
02:12:31,143 --> 02:12:33,611
- Ok, let me drop Myna at home.
- No need to come back sir.

1781
02:12:33,745 --> 02:12:36,407
- You go home first.
- Buy food for him.

1782
02:12:40,619 --> 02:12:41,551
Do you hear me?

1783
02:12:42,988 --> 02:12:44,387
Buy food for him.

1784
02:12:50,595 --> 02:12:52,062
Take care of him.

1785
02:13:18,390 --> 02:13:21,826
- What was the commotion inside?
- Nothing Myna.

1786
02:13:22,027 --> 02:13:25,053
- I heard Suruli's voice.
- I told you, nothing has happened.

1787
02:13:25,163 --> 02:13:26,790
Don't panic.
Start the vehicle.

1788
02:13:54,993 --> 02:13:56,255
Didn't you go to your native?

1789
02:13:58,463 --> 02:14:00,454
While bringing back the accused
we lost our way and..

1790
02:14:00,565 --> 02:14:01,930
Went to Kerala, isn't it?

1791
02:14:12,077 --> 02:14:15,137
She is Myna who is going
to marry that guy. -Greetings sister.

1792
02:14:16,982 --> 02:14:18,745
Tomorrow morning is the
marriage for them.

1793
02:14:18,884 --> 02:14:20,181
She wants to stay here
in this night only.

1794
02:14:21,586 --> 02:14:23,349
Had you planned to send me
to my native for festival..

1795
02:14:23,522 --> 02:14:25,251
And have fun with her here?

1796
02:14:25,390 --> 02:14:26,357
What are you talking?

1797
02:14:26,458 --> 02:14:30,758
Sir, don't fight with her for me.
I will take leave.

1798
02:14:30,896 --> 02:14:32,921
Let me stay in the bus stop
till the dawn.

1799
02:14:33,031 --> 02:14:34,430
Afterwards Suruli will come
and pick me up.

1800
02:14:34,533 --> 02:14:36,558
- See you, sister.
- He is a nice gentleman.

1801
02:14:36,701 --> 02:14:38,862
Don't mistake him.
See you sir.

1802
02:14:39,871 --> 02:14:40,901
- Where are you going?
- No, sir.

1803
02:14:40,906 --> 02:14:42,603
Where will you go at this hour?
Go inside.

1804
02:14:42,741 --> 02:14:44,371
- I am telling you to get in.
- Sir I will take care.

1805
02:14:44,375 --> 02:14:46,576
She seems like a prostitute but
wants to share my bedroom with you?

1806
02:14:47,612 --> 02:14:50,046
- When will you understand me?
- Understand?

1807
02:14:50,082 --> 02:14:51,642
Do you want me to send
you both to the bedroom..

1808
02:14:51,650 --> 02:14:53,311
And wait here for my turn?

1809
02:14:55,220 --> 02:14:56,448
Are you a woman?

1810
02:14:56,721 --> 02:14:57,881
Talking nonsense?

1811
02:14:59,024 --> 02:15:01,015
Don't face me again Get lost.

1812
02:15:01,426 --> 02:15:03,758
You have slapped me before a stranger.

1813
02:15:05,397 --> 02:15:08,264
Henceforth there is no respect
for me in this home

1814
02:15:08,633 --> 02:15:10,328
I will go.

1815
02:15:10,569 --> 02:15:11,763
Go and get lost somewhere.

1816
02:15:12,237 --> 02:15:13,829
He is speaking out of anger..

1817
02:15:17,676 --> 02:15:21,669
You go and enjoy with her.
I will go somewhere and die.

1818
02:15:21,947 --> 02:15:24,745
Don't come back
Go and die somewhere. Go.

1819
02:15:27,552 --> 02:15:28,985
Why do you talk like this?

1820
02:15:29,087 --> 02:15:29,917
Sister..

1821
02:15:30,122 --> 02:15:32,522
Oh God! Sir, go and call her.

1822
02:15:32,691 --> 02:15:33,988
Myna, this is new for you.

1823
02:15:34,126 --> 02:15:35,352
But it has became a usual thing for me.

1824
02:15:35,393 --> 02:15:37,384
- Go and take rest.
- Go and bring her.

1825
02:15:38,096 --> 02:15:39,863
At this hour.. - Listen to me,
get ready in the morning

1826
02:15:39,898 --> 02:15:41,097
I will bring Suruli. Go.

1827
02:15:42,033 --> 02:15:44,092
- Oh God!
- I am telling you to go in.

1828
02:15:53,745 --> 02:15:55,610
- I am Saathaiya..
- Tell me

1829
02:15:55,914 --> 02:15:57,438
I thought to start after finishing duty.

1830
02:15:58,049 --> 02:15:59,482
But Baskar sir has come.

1831
02:15:59,985 --> 02:16:02,044
Why has he come here at this time?

1832
02:16:02,287 --> 02:16:03,777
I don't know what happened.

1833
02:16:04,523 --> 02:16:07,617
Why has he come to jail
instead of celebrating Deepavali?

1834
02:16:07,792 --> 02:16:09,885
He was upset when he came here.

1835
02:16:10,061 --> 02:16:12,529
Ok I will come in the morning.
We will talk after I reach here.

1836
02:16:21,973 --> 02:16:22,997
Here sir.

1837
02:16:26,378 --> 02:16:28,676
You shouldn't have slapped her.

1838
02:16:29,047 --> 02:16:33,006
Any wife will suspect
when you go with a girl at night.

1839
02:16:33,185 --> 02:16:34,277
For that...?

1840
02:16:34,619 --> 02:16:35,811
How can I endure when she abused us?

1841
02:16:35,921 --> 02:16:37,513
Their nature is like that.

1842
02:16:37,689 --> 02:16:38,587
We are men..

1843
02:16:38,723 --> 02:16:41,487
We go to many places, do work
and relax ourselves.

1844
02:16:41,626 --> 02:16:43,025
But the wives stay at home..

1845
02:16:43,328 --> 02:16:44,818
They await us until we get back home..

1846
02:16:44,963 --> 02:16:47,431
And want to spend their time with us.

1847
02:16:47,632 --> 02:16:50,328
On your first Deepavali after wedding,
you should have stayed with her.

1848
02:16:50,569 --> 02:16:51,831
Do you think once?

1849
02:16:51,937 --> 02:16:55,202
She didn't go to her mom's home alone
though you didn't take her.

1850
02:16:55,574 --> 02:16:58,372
Those who're short tempered
have a kind heart.

1851
02:16:58,610 --> 02:17:00,942
First you go to your in-law's home..

1852
02:17:01,046 --> 02:17:03,207
And get into a compromise
with your wife.

1853
02:17:03,415 --> 02:17:05,508
No Ramaiah, let me produce him
in the court

1854
02:17:05,684 --> 02:17:08,178
I will take him to the
court, remand him..

1855
02:17:08,186 --> 02:17:09,951
And take him out in bail.
I will take care of all this.

1856
02:17:09,955 --> 02:17:11,422
You go home.

1857
02:17:12,457 --> 02:17:14,891
Learn to Love,
then your life will be smooth.

1858
02:17:15,060 --> 02:17:17,756
Well said.
Do you hear his words?

1859
02:17:17,896 --> 02:17:20,023
Start to love your wife
then the life will be smooth.

1860
02:17:22,701 --> 02:17:25,067
- Sir, Auto has come.
- Good. Sir, please come.

1861
02:17:25,237 --> 02:17:27,068
On the way we'll drop you
at the bus stop.

1862
02:17:27,205 --> 02:17:29,196
You go to your in-law's home
and we'll go to the court.

1863
02:17:29,307 --> 02:17:31,468
- Sir please come.
- Please come.

1864
02:17:31,876 --> 02:17:33,343
He is smiling.

1865
02:18:01,906 --> 02:18:03,430
- Is Baskar there?
- Who are you?

1866
02:18:03,541 --> 02:18:05,736
I am his neighbour
I want to talk with him.

1867
02:18:05,944 --> 02:18:07,468
Just now he started for court.

1868
02:18:07,679 --> 02:18:08,976
Can you please give his mobile number?

1869
02:18:31,202 --> 02:18:34,228
Sir! Why is there a
big crowd near the track?

1870
02:18:34,339 --> 02:18:36,034
A girl was hit by train and died.

1871
02:18:36,308 --> 02:18:38,868
Oh God! -Young girl only.
It seems pity.

1872
02:18:38,977 --> 02:18:41,571
What to do?
It's all her fate.

1873
02:18:41,780 --> 02:18:44,374
- I will go somewhere and die.
- Start the vehicle.

1874
02:18:44,582 --> 02:18:45,776
Start.

1875
02:18:46,518 --> 02:18:48,645
This is not our division.

1876
02:18:48,787 --> 02:18:50,345
It's getting late
We have to go to court.

1877
02:18:50,555 --> 02:18:52,716
Don't come back.
Go and die somewhere.

1878
02:18:54,926 --> 02:18:56,223
Wait, let me go and see.

1879
02:18:59,197 --> 02:19:01,062
He's going to check as you are afraid.

1880
02:19:01,266 --> 02:19:03,200
Nothing will happen
to your kind heart.

1881
02:19:30,295 --> 02:19:31,455
Sir, I am Ramanathan here.

1882
02:19:32,764 --> 02:19:33,753
Where are you now?

1883
02:19:33,998 --> 02:19:35,727
I am trying to talk to you
from morning itself.

1884
02:19:35,900 --> 02:19:37,595
Morning your brother in laws came here..

1885
02:19:43,475 --> 02:19:45,841
You stay here.
Let him go..

1886
02:20:18,710 --> 02:20:20,177
Bring that damn girl out.

1887
02:20:23,415 --> 02:20:25,940
Come. We should cut off
her throat in the middle of the road.

1888
02:20:26,317 --> 02:20:28,911
You drove away my sister and
enjoying with him, isn't it?

1889
02:20:29,154 --> 02:20:31,145
How dare you enjoy
with him in my sister's home?

1890
02:20:31,289 --> 02:20:33,257
My sister is depressed there..

1891
02:20:33,391 --> 02:20:35,723
But you are enjoying
your stay with him.

1892
02:20:38,897 --> 02:20:39,921
Die off.

1893
02:20:46,104 --> 02:20:47,196
Go and bring the sickle.

1894
02:20:49,140 --> 02:20:50,931
Why do you torture that girl?

1895
02:20:51,042 --> 02:20:52,809
He has driven out my sister
in the middle of the night..

1896
02:20:52,811 --> 02:20:53,869
And enjoying with her.

1897
02:20:54,012 --> 02:20:55,238
Don't you have the guts
to question him?

1898
02:20:55,246 --> 02:20:56,806
Will you stay calm
if it happens in your family?

1899
02:20:56,814 --> 02:20:57,945
He has come to question me.

1900
02:20:58,049 --> 02:20:59,539
Go inside.

1901
02:21:00,151 --> 02:21:01,743
Don't interfere in my family matter.

1902
02:21:01,886 --> 02:21:02,944
Go inside.

1903
02:21:06,624 --> 02:21:08,421
Give it to me.
I will..

1904
02:21:09,961 --> 02:21:11,494
How dare you tell my sister
to get lost and die?

1905
02:21:11,629 --> 02:21:15,725
Damn it. Why should my sister
lose her life for you?

1906
02:21:54,739 --> 02:21:57,902
Oh my God!

1907
02:22:30,308 --> 02:22:33,744
I am your mother.
Let me comb your hair. Ok?

1908
02:22:34,045 --> 02:22:35,706
Oh Mother!

1909
02:22:36,447 --> 02:22:38,881
Eat. Eat well.

1910
02:22:41,019 --> 02:22:44,113
Oh gosh! Are all these flowers for me?

1911
02:22:47,258 --> 02:22:48,657
We have won.

1912
02:22:50,128 --> 02:22:52,790
Oh God! I can't endure this.

1913
02:22:56,501 --> 02:23:00,335
Myna, why did you leave me and go?

1914
02:23:01,873 --> 02:23:03,397
Get up, dear.

1915
02:23:04,309 --> 02:23:05,333
Don't leave me

1916
02:23:05,777 --> 02:23:08,143
I won't leave you, dear

1917
02:23:08,279 --> 02:23:11,077
I won't leave you.

1918
02:23:12,283 --> 02:23:16,515
Myna, don't leave me.

1919
02:23:16,754 --> 02:23:18,187
Don't leave me and go, Myna.

1920
02:23:18,323 --> 02:23:22,384
Don't leave me and go.

1921
02:23:30,768 --> 02:23:32,565
Train is coming.
Lift her..

1922
02:23:32,737 --> 02:23:36,264
- Careful!
- Hold her head. -Come fast.
