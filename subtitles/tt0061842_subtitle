1
00:03:11,457 --> 00:03:14,915
Now I request the queen of sheyat
to distribute the prize.

2
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:19,561
The first prize for acting and
dancing goes to Miss. Shalini

3
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:24,903
Lot of people amongst you
must be aware of the fact-

4
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:28,574
That her father, who has
recently passed away.

5
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:32,400
Had spent his entire life in rendering
his services to the royal court.

6
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:34,238
You dance very well-

7
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:36,411
We will definitely organise a
programme of yours in our royal court

8
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:37,374
Yes, definitely.

9
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:04,105
Ay, what are you doing
what are you doing?

10
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,937
Sister... Sister... Sister.

11
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,117
The entire police force
on one side-

12
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:16,451
And this Robber
on one side.

13
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:18,453
It is indeed
a shame on us-

14
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:20,452
That we are
still unsuccessful

15
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:25,460
Sir, this Robber is now-a-days
under my jurisdiction.

16
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:30,132
I asure you, that he will not be
able to survive for a long.

17
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:33,972
Till the 26th of January, if I don't
produce him infront of you-

18
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,307
Wheter alive or dead-

19
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:39,800
I swear, I'll resign myself
from this job

20
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,496
Alright.

21
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:07,339
Call up Mr. Vishambardass,
I want to meet him.

22
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:15,510
I want to sell this.

23
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:17,846
Sir, The business of
selling is our's

24
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:20,014
If you want to buy something,
please order

25
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:21,186
But for selling-

26
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:23,014
You must be purchasing-from
somewhere or the other, isn't it?

27
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:26,691
He is there,
you can talk to him

28
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:31,526
He will sell the thieved merchandise
somewhere or the other is'nt it

29
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:32,861
May be he comes
at your place.

30
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:35,534
You don't worry, If something
like that happens-

31
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:37,699
You'll be informed
immediately.

32
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:40,205
But, Mr. Commisioner,
the only thing which scares me-

33
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:43,034
Is that, he might land up
here for his robbery.

34
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:45,036
That worry, you
leave it on us-

35
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:47,208
There is a very tight
surveillance in the city

36
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,877
Okay, Greetings

37
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:49,873
Greetings.

38
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:00,392
You.

39
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:05,557
Sir, who I am, and what I want, these
Questions are of no importance to you.

40
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:08,563
The only interest should be that
you need me, as much as I need you-

41
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:10,895
There is no jeweller like you,
and no assayer like me.

42
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:14,232
Leaving Bombay, for the four shops
in Delhi and Bangalore-

43
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,898
You do a purchase of
40 lakhs e very year.

44
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:22,741
I give you a guarantee that if you pay
me a salary of 5000 per mensum

45
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:26,744
Then I can increase your
profit by 5 lakhs per year.

46
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:42,423
Look, this Mr. Has gone
out of his senses-

47
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:44,433
Show him the
way to outside.

48
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:47,095
The inside story is that I'll myself
look for the outside way

49
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:49,441
Actually I thought, that you were
a very good assayer-

50
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:50,598
You are always in search
for diamonds-

51
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:51,769
But I regret-

52
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:53,942
That a priceless diamond has himself
come in search of you-

53
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:55,273
And you are not
able to assay him

54
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:58,116
Probably for this alone
you require an assayer like me

55
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:00,953
Daddy in the evening I'll not be
available in the house

56
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:02,951
In the afternoon we are
going to our farm house

57
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:04,123
Come back soon

58
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:06,454
I'll come back

59
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,227
Just see, what has
happened to him?

60
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:40,558
Arey, he is not
getting up at all

61
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:41,562
Come let's go and see.

62
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:47,238
Arey, he has
become unconcious.

63
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:48,231
Now, what to do?

64
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:49,567
See if he is
breathing or not?

65
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:55,410
Come, Come let's
take him inside

66
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:58,082
A little forward, a little forward
my house is there

67
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:01,245
Have I told
something wrong?

68
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:03,422
Alright,
I'll go, I'll go

69
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:05,750
I extend my thanks
to all the ladies-

70
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:08,758
That with so much of
love and affection-

71
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:10,088
You have all made me
reach here-

72
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:14,258
If next time you do
something like this...

73
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,428
Is this any new fashion of wearing
an-ear-ring only in one ear

74
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:19,934
Even you have only
one ear-ring

75
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:22,771
Oh... search for it

76
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:24,272
Was it very costly?

77
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:26,945
Costly...?
It was a pair worth Rs.12000.00-

78
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:28,113
Now what will
daddy tell?

79
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:28,939
12000.00

80
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:31,442
Even if anybody pays you
even 1200.00 for this-

81
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,447
Think that you have made
a profit of Rs.200-400

82
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:34,619
1200.00

83
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:37,956
What did you say?
Tell it again

84
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:40,284
The truth is
always bitter

85
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:43,287
Even, if it is worth a penny
less than 12000.00-

86
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:44,463
Then, I'll loose on
whatever you say

87
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:45,288
You bet it.

88
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:45,964
Done

89
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:48,467
If it is worth a penny
more than 1200.00-

90
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:50,464
Then I'll loose this
innocent heart of mine.

91
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:03,940
Do remember
my address

92
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:05,980
I stay here only
near your neighbourhood.

93
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:09,988
Sir, it is absolutely
genuine-

94
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:11,990
That man is absoutely
tacking non-sense

95
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:14,485
That man, who is absolutely
talking non-sense-

96
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:16,654
Has proved.

97
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,498
That you all people
are talking non-sense

98
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:21,659
Inspite of looking into
it so minutely-

99
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:23,835
You could'nt get to know
of that defect-

100
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:26,504
Which his eyes could
look into it from far

101
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:33,503
Sir...

102
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:37,341
Sometimes a thirsty.
Goes to the well-

103
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,847
And sometimes the well
comes to a thirsty

104
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:42,013
Tell me, how did you search
of this poor dwelling?

105
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:44,356
Even you are interested
in catching fishes-

106
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:46,687
And even I am

107
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:50,862
Have you got hold
of any fish

108
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,357
I have thrown the hook;
let's see

109
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:57,357
It will get caught
5000. Rupees

110
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:01,365
Yesterday the worth of
the well was more-

111
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:03,534
And Today its
of the parched

112
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:10,872
6,8,10

113
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:11,879
Enough, enough, enough

114
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:16,547
Sir, you are throwing the hook
or are you spreading a net

115
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:20,388
If I get to see
a golden fish-

116
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:22,720
Then nobody
can say this-

117
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:24,221
That I am not an assayer

118
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:30,565
Sir, the rates you have
charged are very high

119
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:31,736
Sir, but how?

120
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:37,568
Sir, what I mean is that how can I
charge for a single pearl-

121
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:40,912
You are an old customer of mine
Altogether it's worth Rs. 1,25,000

122
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,240
Alright. I'll finish the deal
with you for Rs. 1,00,000

123
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:44,916
Sir, Beleive me, this time
I have gone to palaces-

124
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:46,745
For collecting diamonds, emeralds
and pearls-

125
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:48,249
With a great difficulty

126
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:51,422
Have patience
be seated

127
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:52,591
Yes. Ofcourse.
I am seated

128
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:54,926
I have written the rate for
each and every diamond-

129
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:57,925
Putting altogether, the deal is
worth Rs.72,450

130
00:14:58,097 --> 00:14:58,756
You can carry on

131
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:00,428
But, if you pay
a penny more-

132
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:02,100
Then you are paying me
my salary for no reason

133
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:05,596
My dear, what's all this
talk to me

134
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:08,432
Rs. 72,450

135
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:10,939
Sir, I beg of you
Don't do this to me

136
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:13,778
Here, please correct it

137
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:25,783
Without the ear-rings the ears
look how much desolated

138
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:27,125
So, you have even
reached here

139
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:29,294
I have come,
but still not reached

140
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:31,960
You look to be
very clever

141
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:32,790
Your blessings are there

142
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:33,965
Do you work
over here?

143
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,292
Tell me, how can I
serve you

144
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:36,630
I need a necklace

145
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:37,301
Definitely

146
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:39,470
I'll show you
such a necklace-

147
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:41,299
That, once it touches
your neck

148
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,967
It will double
it's glitter

149
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:59,984
On this velvety fair neck, this
white necklace of genuine pearls

150
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:01,489
looks as if

151
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:04,992
Like, the sky which is dissolved
by the moon light

152
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:06,824
Is waving a flag

153
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:08,996
10,000

154
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:12,003
Probably, the priced is a little
high for you

155
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:15,836
Very less, show me
something costly

156
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:17,500
Definitely

157
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:26,184
How do you like this?

158
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:32,520
It seems like
a lake of milk

159
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:35,856
Upon which, it has golden leaves
with red lotuses blossomed on them

160
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:37,661
25,000

161
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:42,022
That's all, not so cheap, show me
something more costlier

162
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:56,715
And... Look at this

163
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:03,686
Sparkling rays have condensed and
have contracted on your neck

164
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,019
These diamonds wanted to
compete with your eyes-

165
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:09,558
But I think they are
now feeling shy

166
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:10,658
And it's also right

167
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,093
Because there is a saying, that for
a woman, shiness is her real jewel

168
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:14,424
1,00,000

169
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:16,599
That's the price

170
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,999
Beyond the diamonds
are your words

171
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,728
And you are
beyond my words

172
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:25,241
Look that...

173
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:26,843
Sir, look at this even
he would remember-

174
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,344
On the very first day itself I
have increase the sale by Rs.1,00,000

175
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:30,071
Very good, very good

176
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:32,250
Look, that negotiation has
been settled for Rs.80,000

177
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:33,247
What is your suggestion
on this?

178
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:34,043
Immediately settled for it

179
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:36,653
I knew that he would agree on 80,
that's why I told 72

180
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:37,412
Very good, very good.

181
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:42,260
I see, by selling a thing
for Rs.1,00,000

182
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:43,689
You want to make me
insolvent

183
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:44,586
What?

184
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:46,822
Don't you know, that she is
my daughter Anjali

185
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,100
Arey, Amar, I am
talking to you

186
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:53,434
Tell me,
How are you?

187
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:54,869
Do you know me?

188
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:57,935
Do I know you? Wonderful...
are you joking with me?

189
00:17:58,143 --> 00:17:58,939
When did you come
to Bombay?

190
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:01,435
From where?

191
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,044
Where else? Friend, from Delhi
where else

192
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:07,285
You are under mistaken. My name is
Vinay and not Amar

193
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:12,791
Yes

194
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:26,966
Amar, good that I found you,
here. Take back your money

195
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:28,432
It was very helpful
at the right time.

196
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:30,469
Who told you that
I am Amar?

197
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:34,676
Alright, today you may
not be Amar

198
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,177
But atleast you keep
your money

199
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:38,439
Listen...

200
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:40,909
Why are you so much
preplexed

201
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,953
He has given you some thing
not taken

202
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:52,425
The evening was good, the food
was good, and your company too

203
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,156
Don't forget my party

204
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:54,832
Never

205
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:58,465
Does anybody stay in your shed
now-a-days, the light is on

206
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:13,947
Yes

207
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:17,287
You are holding my book
in your hands

208
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:25,260
I am Shalini

209
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:29,696
Probably you want to meet your
father, he is there

210
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:37,200
Daughter, how did you
come here?

211
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:38,633
Is she Anju?

212
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:39,208
Yes, yes

213
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:40,645
She has grown up
so much

214
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:43,609
After how many years am I
seeing her?

215
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,884
I think, after 1955

216
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:47,312
Which means 12 years
have passed-

217
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:49,486
How fast does the time
pass away

218
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:52,223
At that time, she used to roam
about wearing a frock-

219
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:53,220
Do you remember

220
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:54,559
Daughter, you don't know-

221
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:56,890
That your father and I are
childhood friends

222
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:00,723
We did our education together
started our business at the same time-

223
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,591
Now look, how big a business man
he has become

224
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:05,735
Did you meet Shalu?

225
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:10,307
What happened? Why are you
standing aloof like this?

226
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:11,373
Come here

227
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:15,341
She is my younger sister, Shalini
she has come first time to Bombay

228
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:16,907
Show her the city

229
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:18,240
Will you?

230
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:19,075
Yes, definitely

231
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:21,752
But Daddy, why didn't you make them
stay in the flat?

232
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:23,512
Here, who will take care
of their food?

233
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:24,586
I had very much
told them

234
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:26,585
Actually, we people are from
the highlanders

235
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:29,153
We get disturbed with the
fast city life

236
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:32,326
Here, there are no mountians covered
with snow, like in Sikkim

237
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:34,499
But, here there is
atleast fresh air water-

238
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:36,434
But this time you must definitely
come to Gangtok

239
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:37,260
I will definitely come

240
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:37,958
And...

241
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,762
And, I'll also bring Anju along
why Anju?

242
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:40,832
You'll come, is'nt it?

243
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:41,596
Yes definitely

244
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,598
The necklace that you are wearing
is realy beautiful-

245
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:44,434
Who gave it to you
is it daddy?

246
00:20:57,489 --> 00:20:58,183
God bless you

247
00:20:58,423 --> 00:20:59,287
Come let's go that side

248
00:20:59,491 --> 00:21:00,116
Come

249
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:10,764
So finally you got the time

250
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:11,628
I have got little delayed

251
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:20,641
Now, your friends have also started
this joke with me

252
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:25,248
Amar, I went mad
waiting for you

253
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:26,643
And you didn't even
write to me-

254
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:28,718
As to where are you, what are you
doing, and when will you come back?

255
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,148
You forgot me so much

256
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:34,583
Miss. Shalu, his name is Vinay
and not Amar

257
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,090
Oh Gosh, as if I don't know
my fiancee's name

258
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:40,721
Amar, from when have you
become Vinay?

259
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:42,330
Madam, I am called Vinay right
from my birth-

260
00:21:42,534 --> 00:21:44,468
You are forcing me
to become Amar

261
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:55,436
Why do you want to ridicule me
infront of every body?

262
00:21:56,615 --> 00:21:58,014
What exactly do you
want to prove?

263
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:01,580
Why are you addressing me with
so much of respect?

264
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:02,751
I am your Shalu.

265
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:04,279
My Shalu

266
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:10,760
Is there any specific reason for
not recognising me today?

267
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:13,863
Madam, I would feel very happy
in recognising you-

268
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:16,534
But unfortunately, I haven't
met you before

269
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:22,197
Why are you joking?

270
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:23,931
I am not joking, but you are
getting deceived

271
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:27,703
I am getting deceived or
I have already got

272
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:33,046
What's this?

273
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:34,980
The ring which was
given by you-

274
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,514
The sign of our
engagement

275
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:43,352
Anju, just tell her how few people
have earlier got deceived like this

276
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:44,961
The talk is between
me and you-

277
00:22:45,163 --> 00:22:46,391
Why are you dragging this
innocent in between?

278
00:22:46,598 --> 00:22:48,225
That's because you don't beleive
on what I say

279
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:49,734
That's because
I am not Amar

280
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:55,065
Amar, after the engagement is over,
it can be broken-

281
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,032
But, this is not the way how
decent people should behave

282
00:22:57,175 --> 00:22:59,405
Madam, men can be made
to get entrappet

283
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:01,572
But, this is not the way how
decent girls should behave

284
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:10,076
Amar, why are you insulting me
infront of so many people?

285
00:23:10,455 --> 00:23:12,423
Whats this when I haven't met you,
how can I know you? -

286
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:13,922
When, I am telling that I am
not Amar

287
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:14,922
You are Amar and
only Amar-

288
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:16,594
You are not revealing your name,
may be because of any specific reason

289
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:20,761
Look, if any other girl has come
in your life-

290
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:23,260
If I am longer
that Shalu to you-

291
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:24,765
Without whom you were
not interested-

292
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,267
In spending even two moment's
of your life

293
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:28,439
If you feel happy in destroying
melike this-

294
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:31,098
Then tell me clearly even I'll
call you Vinay from today

295
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:32,606
Anju please,
somebody stop her-

296
00:23:32,811 --> 00:23:34,438
I haven't seen her met her, she is
forcibility imposing her on me

297
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:38,578
Imposing on you... brother

298
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:42,783
Amar, this means at this time you
don't want to even recognise me

299
00:23:43,822 --> 00:23:45,449
Why are you looking at that side?
Look here

300
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:48,126
Who is he?

301
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:49,960
He very well knows,
who I am

302
00:23:50,328 --> 00:23:51,124
But he is
pretending

303
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:55,292
Either you are a brilliant hooligan
or you are trying to act.

304
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,627
Look brother either you are struck to
some misunderstanding or...

305
00:23:57,836 --> 00:23:58,461
Don't blaber

306
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:00,138
Infront of so many
people-

307
00:24:00,338 --> 00:24:01,464
I have done the engagement
of my sister with you-

308
00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:03,300
Every child of Gangtok is a
proof of this-

309
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:04,475
And now you are
planily refusing

310
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:08,479
I don't understand, what trap is
being plotted against me?

311
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,647
What trap is being
plotted...

312
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:12,146
Tack decently.
There is a height for tolerance

313
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:14,314
By more, physical strength, if you
want to prove-

314
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:15,611
That I am not what I am
and somebody else

315
00:24:15,854 --> 00:24:17,481
Then don't forget, that even I
have two hands

316
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:20,317
But Amar, why are you doing
like this?

317
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:22,993
If you want to break the engagement,
then tell us clearly-

318
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:24,662
We will not pressurise you
in any way

319
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:26,490
But, amongst so many
people you are...

320
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:29,657
That's because I am not Amar
you are lying, your sister is lying

321
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:34,004
No brother no...
Brother no...

322
00:24:34,206 --> 00:24:35,002
Leave me-

323
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:38,008
It is better I get hanged after
killing such a person-

324
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:39,507
Atleast he will not be able to
insult somebody else.

325
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:41,339
You are insulting me

326
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,847
Neither I have met you,
nor do I know you-

327
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:44,174
And you say that I am related
to your sister

328
00:24:44,883 --> 00:24:47,511
Amar, I am sure, decently you will
not tell the truth

329
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:49,012
No, brother no... brother

330
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:51,518
What are you doing? Leave, leve.

331
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:55,018
Leave me, I'll not
do anything.

332
00:24:55,393 --> 00:24:56,519
I say leave me...

333
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:04,194
I just want to ask you
one question-

334
00:25:06,404 --> 00:25:08,531
You say that I haven't seen you
anytime before

335
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:09,198
It's a fact.

336
00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:13,536
It means that, I know about you
only much-

337
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:14,701
As I can know about you,
us of now

338
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:15,709
What exactly do you
want to say?

339
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:17,878
That right now you have
worn a shoe-

340
00:25:18,416 --> 00:25:21,715
But still, I can tell that
trace of your leg-

341
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,047
Which may be known, to only those
who are very close to your-

342
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:25,886
And what's that?

343
00:25:27,092 --> 00:25:28,719
Your right leg has
six finger's-

344
00:25:30,428 --> 00:25:32,055
And if it's there,
then Amar, -

345
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:34,732
You are not disclosing your true
identity, with some special intention

346
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,398
And now you remove your shoes
in front of everybody and prove

347
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,066
That I am a lier

348
00:25:42,774 --> 00:25:44,571
Look Mr... What ever
your name is...

349
00:25:44,776 --> 00:25:47,074
I don't have to prove anything
about myself-, but...

350
00:25:47,612 --> 00:25:49,409
By your talk, I have started
believing-

351
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:52,083
That you had been connected
to such a person-

352
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:54,252
Who in looks was as identical
as me-

353
00:25:54,452 --> 00:25:55,749
Now in the capacity of
my decency-

354
00:25:55,954 --> 00:25:57,421
I want to make you
believe

355
00:25:57,622 --> 00:26:00,250
That I am not that person,
you are badly under deception

356
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:02,092
Which means you are scared
of removing the shoes-

357
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,085
You may think
the same

358
00:26:03,461 --> 00:26:06,259
But, the truth is-

359
00:26:06,965 --> 00:26:08,762
That, in such a big party
like this-

360
00:26:09,134 --> 00:26:10,931
Removing shoes will be
against manners-

361
00:26:11,469 --> 00:26:12,595
And secondly,
I am scared-

362
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:15,766
If my sock's
are torn-

363
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:18,272
This is nothing,
but an excuse

364
00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:19,439
What do we understand
from this?

365
00:26:19,644 --> 00:26:20,440
What should we
understand-

366
00:26:20,645 --> 00:26:22,772
He is scared that the truth will be
unveiled if he removes his shoe

367
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:24,778
Vinay Why don't you show
your leg?

368
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:26,617
Now you will definitely have to
remove your shoe

369
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:43,130
Not left but right

370
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:52,699
Two people can resemble
so much

371
00:27:53,738 --> 00:27:57,037
Shalu, we must seek forgiveness
from him

372
00:27:58,076 --> 00:28:01,705
I... I am very
much ashamed

373
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:06,213
Brother, forgive me.

374
00:28:09,754 --> 00:28:11,881
Your face resembls Amar to
such great ex tent-

375
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:13,717
That what myself, anybody
can get decepted

376
00:28:27,272 --> 00:28:27,738
Who is it?

377
00:28:28,773 --> 00:28:29,239
Mother...

378
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:32,569
Is daddy in
the house?

379
00:28:33,611 --> 00:28:34,236
Wait

380
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:50,759
My child, my son, you have come
after so many months

381
00:28:50,962 --> 00:28:53,931
But Mother, this time I haven't
come empty handed; Iook

382
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:02,106
Where have you brought
this from?

383
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:04,104
It is a stolen one...

384
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:07,437
I'll hit you, if you utter
something like that

385
00:29:07,645 --> 00:29:08,612
This is of Genuine
pearls-

386
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,777
I have paid my entire month's
salary on this-

387
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:14,782
So, you have started woring,
thank's to God-

388
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:16,284
After all he gave you
the wisdom

389
00:29:16,654 --> 00:29:18,622
If you would have listened to
your father, initially itself

390
00:29:18,823 --> 00:29:19,790
What loss would have
you made?

391
00:29:19,991 --> 00:29:21,288
IF I had listened
to my daddy-

392
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:22,960
Could I had ever bought for you
in my entire life

393
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:25,459
A necklace worth
Rs.10,000

394
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:27,456
10,000

395
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:30,801
You earn 10,000 rupees
in one month

396
00:29:31,002 --> 00:29:33,300
Ask daddy, he has spent 40 years
in the service-

397
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:34,472
What salary does he
get now?

398
00:29:35,173 --> 00:29:38,472
He has wasted his life, and was
bying to parcel mine too

399
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:39,635
Who is there
inside?

400
00:29:50,688 --> 00:29:51,655
Whom were you
talking to?

401
00:29:52,524 --> 00:29:53,491
I was talking...?

402
00:29:54,692 --> 00:29:55,818
Are your ears
echoing?

403
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:02,660
I see, I thought as if I could
hear Vinay's voice

404
00:30:03,034 --> 00:30:04,831
See this only
happens-

405
00:30:05,203 --> 00:30:07,671
When you ask a good young boy
to leavefrom the house

406
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:09,173
Even if rats
make a noice-

407
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:11,668
It looks as if the voice of
the son is heard

408
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:15,008
By giving such an
unless child-

409
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:18,675
For what has the derting
taken it's revenge againt me?

410
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:21,177
By your telling, will anybody
become useless

411
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:24,021
one year he failed
in metric

412
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:25,856
One year he failed
in Inter

413
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:27,521
One year he failed
in B.A.

414
00:30:27,892 --> 00:30:28,358
Alright

415
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:31,688
But still by God's grace I
atleast had that much of influence-

416
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:35,358
That I could have got that Ass a job
for 300-400 somewhere or the other-

417
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:38,532
But only if he had got time
other than collecting stones

418
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:40,864
Whenever seen, he'll be found
only collecting stones

419
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:43,366
Alright, as one sow's
so he reaps

420
00:30:43,908 --> 00:30:44,875
If he collects only stones-

421
00:30:45,043 --> 00:30:46,203
Then even in his destiny only
stones will get deposited

422
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:46,706
Then what?

423
00:30:46,911 --> 00:30:48,879
You'll even call a diamond
to be a stone

424
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,547
You'll call a coral also
to be a stone

425
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:53,547
And, you'll call those pearls
also to be stones

426
00:30:53,751 --> 00:30:56,049
Wearing a necklace, are you
in your senses

427
00:30:57,922 --> 00:31:00,891
Arey, where did this
come from?

428
00:31:01,092 --> 00:31:04,095
Where ever it has come from? It's
value is Rs.10,000

429
00:31:04,128 --> 00:31:04,720
10,000?

430
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:07,565
Arey, Rs.10,000 didn't even come
in your dowry

431
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:09,733
But, where did
you bring this from?

432
00:31:09,934 --> 00:31:10,901
From where ever-

433
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:14,405
May be my useless son had
given this to me

434
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:15,573
Did Vinay come?

435
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:19,072
I am asking you, did Vinay
come here?

436
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:20,908
Who allowed him to enter
this house?

437
00:31:21,946 --> 00:31:23,743
What did you say
Rs.10,000-

438
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:26,242
How did he get
Rs.10,000?

439
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:28,916
From where ever, How does it
concern you?

440
00:31:29,787 --> 00:31:30,754
Look, let me make it clear-

441
00:31:30,955 --> 00:31:32,422
That In my house such a thing
should not enter

442
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:33,916
May be it is a
stolen article

443
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:36,093
Yes, yes, in the house of a
police commissioner-

444
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:38,262
Will a Robber take birth or
an inspector of an police

445
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:40,757
But, where did he get such a
huge sum from?

446
00:31:41,132 --> 00:31:43,600
Why, can't your son earn
such a huge sum?

447
00:31:44,135 --> 00:31:46,069
My son, never-

448
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:49,098
If he blabbers that he has bought
this from his salary-

449
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:52,109
Then its worth can-not be more
than Rs.10

450
00:31:52,977 --> 00:31:54,103
If it's worth Rs.10
let it be-

451
00:31:54,312 --> 00:31:57,281
He has given it to me, why are you
feeling so jealous

452
00:31:57,815 --> 00:32:00,943
I am feeling jealous, my God
I am feeling jealous

453
00:32:02,487 --> 00:32:04,114
In his entire life he has
not earned a penny-

454
00:32:04,989 --> 00:32:06,616
He'll buy a necklace
worth Rs. 10,000 and come

455
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:08,785
I am feeling
jealous

456
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:12,788
Please come

457
00:32:17,168 --> 00:32:18,294
Why did you take the trouble
of coming?

458
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:20,467
You should have ordered me,
I would have come

459
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:22,966
Nothing, I had a
small work

460
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:27,640
What will be the price of
this necklace

461
00:32:30,014 --> 00:32:31,140
Till yesterday. It was
in my shop

462
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:31,974
Was it stolen?

463
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:34,311
No no, I have appointed a
new attendant-

464
00:32:34,852 --> 00:32:36,319
Yesterday, when his first
salary was given

465
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:40,488
He told me sir, in lieu of my salary
I want to buy this necklace

466
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:42,489
I told him, what's
the matter?

467
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:44,161
Whom are you giving this necklace
what Rs.10,000

468
00:32:45,196 --> 00:32:46,663
He told me, it's for
someone's special

469
00:32:47,198 --> 00:32:47,994
What is his
name?

470
00:32:52,036 --> 00:32:54,004
Mr. Commissioner, that boy is
simply superb-

471
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:57,837
His eyes can pierce the heart
of the stone and see

472
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:00,507
And regarding diamond's and
other precious stones-

473
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:02,509
He says from the childhood he
hasn't filtered mud-

474
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:07,014
Has filtered only
pearls

475
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:09,516
I have given him a start
of Rs.10,000-

476
00:33:10,054 --> 00:33:11,521
Let's see, how far
he grows?

477
00:33:12,056 --> 00:33:13,523
Okay, how I'll
take leave

478
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:14,692
Will you not meet him
and go?

479
00:33:14,892 --> 00:33:17,190
No, whatever I wanted to know,
I have known-

480
00:33:32,577 --> 00:33:35,546
Vinay, the necklace which you had
bought yesterday-

481
00:33:36,414 --> 00:33:38,211
How did it reach to
Mr. Commissioner?

482
00:33:40,084 --> 00:33:42,552
Sir, Mr. Commissioner
is my father

483
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:01,739
Excuse me
is Shalu here?

484
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:03,232
What will she do
coming here?

485
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:07,407
Is everything
alright?

486
00:34:08,112 --> 00:34:10,239
I can't say, in the night when
I woke up-

487
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:11,244
I saw that she was not
on her bed

488
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:16,583
Since yesterday she is behaving
very indifferent-

489
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:19,248
I am scared if she does
something stupid

490
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:21,922
I'll go, I'll search
for her.

491
00:39:18,589 --> 00:39:19,556
And, when Dawn arises

492
00:39:25,763 --> 00:39:27,890
On somebody's tears, It's not
good to laugh

493
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:33,229
I'll laugh, that's because a mere
dream made you cry

494
00:39:34,438 --> 00:39:35,564
The one who see's
a dream-

495
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:39,068
Only that person can understand
the pain of it's breaking

496
00:39:39,777 --> 00:39:43,577
When the dream breaks, then one
should open the eyes

497
00:39:44,448 --> 00:39:47,076
To see. What,
the darkness

498
00:39:47,284 --> 00:39:50,583
No, to see, that the night
is passing off-

499
00:39:51,122 --> 00:39:52,089
The Dawn will
definitely arise

500
00:39:55,459 --> 00:39:59,919
But still, the wound takes
time to get healed

501
00:40:00,464 --> 00:40:01,931
If the remedy is given
it get's healed up faster

502
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:06,099
Have you come here
as a doctor?

503
00:40:08,806 --> 00:40:12,105
For such wounds, instead of a doctor
a friend is required

504
00:40:32,997 --> 00:40:33,964
See, how I
scared you?

505
00:40:34,832 --> 00:40:37,300
When a guest is in the house, one
shouldn't look into the time

506
00:40:42,339 --> 00:40:44,307
Come here,
sit closer to me-

507
00:40:44,508 --> 00:40:46,305
Talk something romantic with me

508
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:47,101
The night will pass off
within a flick

509
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:50,143
Come on, leave
this room-

510
00:40:50,514 --> 00:40:53,483
Otherwise tomorrow your daddy
will sack me from my job

511
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:56,983
It would be good, I'll make you
my secretary

512
00:41:00,357 --> 00:41:01,324
What salary would
you charge?

513
00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:04,156
Now, what will you take for
leaving from here

514
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:07,155
Will you give?

515
00:41:10,534 --> 00:41:11,831
Look, you got
scared

516
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:16,173
Look, your coming here like this
is not at all good

517
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:18,668
That's because, you are a man
and I am a woman

518
00:41:20,711 --> 00:41:22,508
For sometime, why don't you
forget on the fact-

519
00:41:22,713 --> 00:41:24,510
Of you being a man and
me to be a woman

520
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:26,175
Even in the scriptures
it is written-

521
00:41:26,383 --> 00:41:28,010
That the sout has
no sex

522
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:30,346
Learned person, shower your
grace on me-

523
00:41:30,554 --> 00:41:33,182
Tomorrow it's sunday, the whole day
I'll do your slavery

524
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:35,517
But at this time, you better
leave this place

525
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:38,855
Alright, leave me
till the car

526
00:41:40,397 --> 00:41:40,863
Come

527
00:41:41,565 --> 00:41:43,192
I'll not get up

528
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:43,862
Then?

529
00:41:44,401 --> 00:41:45,698
Then what carry me-

530
00:41:46,403 --> 00:41:47,028
You...

531
00:41:47,571 --> 00:41:49,038
No, this bed

532
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:51,867
Alright, come.

533
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:01,214
Is the weight more?

534
00:42:01,585 --> 00:42:02,882
Till now
I am alive

535
00:42:07,591 --> 00:42:08,717
Come, drop me till
my house

536
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,387
Till your house; and how will I
come back?

537
00:42:11,595 --> 00:42:12,391
Take the car along
with you

538
00:42:12,596 --> 00:42:14,723
In the morning anyway's you have to
come for slavery

539
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:15,895
Or have you forgotton
now itself-

540
00:42:16,433 --> 00:42:17,900
Only if you make
me forget

541
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:19,236
Alright, get inside

542
00:42:22,106 --> 00:42:24,734
I'll pack food in the lunch box
and tea in the flask

543
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:26,906
We'll take 2-4 bottles of beer
with us-

544
00:42:27,278 --> 00:42:28,745
Let's make this picnic which we
never forget

545
00:42:28,946 --> 00:42:29,412
Why?

546
00:42:40,457 --> 00:42:41,082
For me

547
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:42,589
Only if you
accept it

548
00:42:45,462 --> 00:42:46,588
I have no courage
to refuse it

549
00:42:46,797 --> 00:42:47,263
Please come

550
00:42:47,965 --> 00:42:49,762
But suddenly, how did you feel
that I am worthy of this?

551
00:42:52,303 --> 00:42:54,771
You gave me the strength to
compete with the life-

552
00:42:55,806 --> 00:42:57,433
In return, it's a very
small gift

553
00:42:58,309 --> 00:42:58,934
Sit down

554
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:03,940
Can I open it
and see?

555
00:43:04,481 --> 00:43:04,947
Definitely

556
00:43:28,505 --> 00:43:29,472
You didn't like it

557
00:43:31,008 --> 00:43:33,476
Miss. Shalini if you want to
make me Amar-

558
00:43:33,677 --> 00:43:34,644
Then you are mistaken-

559
00:43:35,846 --> 00:43:37,973
If you want to grow your
friendship with me-

560
00:43:38,182 --> 00:43:39,479
Just because you find Amar
in me-

561
00:43:40,351 --> 00:43:43,320
Then you can understand that how much
my self-respect will get hurt

562
00:43:45,689 --> 00:43:47,316
If I give you the rememberance
of Amar-

563
00:43:47,524 --> 00:43:49,492
Then I'll indeed feel happy
in staying away from you

564
00:43:50,361 --> 00:43:52,488
But yes, If I can help you in
forgetting of Amar's rememberances-

565
00:43:53,197 --> 00:43:54,323
Then you can consider me
as your friend

566
00:43:58,535 --> 00:44:00,503
By mistake, I understood you
as my friend

567
00:44:29,733 --> 00:44:31,030
Not Amar, But Vinay

568
00:44:32,403 --> 00:44:33,870
You felt bad of my talk
and walked away

569
00:44:34,238 --> 00:44:36,035
Not at all, I have no
such rights

570
00:44:36,407 --> 00:44:37,032
Tell me, how do
I look?

571
00:44:38,575 --> 00:44:39,542
Absolutely the same

572
00:44:47,084 --> 00:44:47,550
Wait

573
00:44:55,592 --> 00:44:56,718
Even this
just like that

574
00:44:58,595 --> 00:44:59,562
Don't feel bad

575
00:45:00,264 --> 00:45:01,060
But, on one condition

576
00:45:01,598 --> 00:45:02,223
Tell me

577
00:45:03,434 --> 00:45:04,901
I became Amar for
your happiness

578
00:45:05,602 --> 00:45:08,400
For my happiness, you think me
to be just like Amar

579
00:45:10,774 --> 00:45:13,402
Atleast for today,
agreed

580
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:14,736
Agreed

581
00:45:27,124 --> 00:45:29,422
If Amar was there, had anybody
dared to overtake him like this

582
00:46:26,517 --> 00:46:27,643
If we had met with an
accident, then?

583
00:46:32,856 --> 00:46:33,322
What happened?

584
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:38,328
Last year, the aeroplane tragedy
that took place in Kashmir-

585
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:41,497
My mother and father
were in that

586
00:46:43,534 --> 00:46:45,001
I couldn't even see their
dead bodies

587
00:46:48,705 --> 00:46:50,172
Do you have any other
brother or sister?

588
00:46:52,376 --> 00:46:55,675
There is only one brother, I am
alive only for him

589
00:46:56,046 --> 00:46:57,172
Only for him

590
00:46:58,549 --> 00:47:00,016
Your brother is
very good

591
00:47:08,392 --> 00:47:12,021
Brother, we don't object on romance,
but in the middle of the road

592
00:47:12,396 --> 00:47:13,693
Search for a better place

593
00:47:15,399 --> 00:47:17,867
Okay tell me, the difference
between me and him?

594
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:20,696
There's no difference
at all-

595
00:47:22,072 --> 00:47:23,369
But still, there's a lot
of difference

596
00:47:23,574 --> 00:47:24,040
For example

597
00:47:25,242 --> 00:47:25,867
For example

598
00:47:28,245 --> 00:47:29,542
He had the same eyes-

599
00:47:30,914 --> 00:47:32,711
But, when he used to
look at me, -

600
00:47:33,417 --> 00:47:34,884
Something used to happen
within

601
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:37,546
He had the same voice
as yours-

602
00:47:38,589 --> 00:47:39,886
But, when he used to speak-

603
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:41,887
Then something used to happen
within

604
00:47:43,427 --> 00:47:44,553
He had the same style of
walking as yours-

605
00:47:45,095 --> 00:47:46,892
But when he used
to walk-

606
00:47:47,064 --> 00:47:48,725
Then something used to
happen within

607
00:47:49,766 --> 00:47:50,733
He had the same lips
as yours

608
00:47:51,935 --> 00:47:52,230
But when...

609
00:47:52,436 --> 00:47:55,064
But when he used
to use it

610
00:47:55,272 --> 00:47:56,569
Yes, when he used...

611
00:47:59,276 --> 00:48:04,615
What do you mean?

612
00:48:04,648 --> 00:48:05,081
Further...

613
00:48:06,783 --> 00:48:08,080
And when he used to recite
a versification

614
00:48:08,285 --> 00:48:09,582
He used to do versification
too

615
00:48:09,953 --> 00:48:11,580
And, when he used
to sing in a tune

616
00:48:11,788 --> 00:48:12,755
He also used to sing

617
00:48:12,956 --> 00:48:14,924
Like he used to wassail
the world of love

618
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:16,422
Just let me hear any
of his poetry-

619
00:48:16,627 --> 00:48:18,094
Let me also know what kind of
world he used to wassail

620
00:48:19,463 --> 00:48:20,589
For example, he only
told this-

621
00:48:21,131 --> 00:48:23,599
Beneath the sky.
Today we are back of us-

622
00:48:24,134 --> 00:48:26,102
We have wassailed the
world of love-

623
00:48:26,303 --> 00:48:27,770
We have made the prints
of our foot-steps

624
00:48:27,971 --> 00:48:30,098
This looks like a cheap poetry

625
00:48:31,475 --> 00:48:32,601
What do you mean by cheap-

626
00:48:32,809 --> 00:48:33,935
What do you know about
versification

627
00:48:34,111 --> 00:48:35,442
Why do you get angry
for this?

628
00:48:35,646 --> 00:48:37,273
May be it sounds good
in a tune

629
00:48:37,981 --> 00:48:40,108
I see... very good

630
00:48:40,984 --> 00:48:41,780
What do I know-

631
00:48:41,985 --> 00:48:42,952
Had I heard it, I could
have give my opinion

632
00:48:43,487 --> 00:48:45,455
Nobody needs your
opinion

633
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:47,616
Your wish

634
00:49:17,688 --> 00:49:18,154
Further...

635
00:49:26,196 --> 00:49:26,491
Then,

636
00:49:39,376 --> 00:49:41,173
Madam, This is a song
or a kawali (frolic)

637
00:49:52,556 --> 00:49:54,023
You anyway's look like
a funster

638
00:49:54,558 --> 00:49:56,856
If you even sing a clasical song
it will look like a kawali (frolic)

639
00:53:49,626 --> 00:53:50,251
Ring...

640
00:53:50,794 --> 00:53:51,920
The incident is of the
last year-

641
00:53:52,295 --> 00:53:53,922
Those days I used to stay
in pune-

642
00:53:54,631 --> 00:53:55,928
There was a theft which
took place in my house

643
00:53:56,299 --> 00:53:57,926
The report of which is recorded
in that station

644
00:53:58,802 --> 00:54:01,270
The jewels which had got theived
among those this ring was also there

645
00:54:02,806 --> 00:54:04,774
The one whom you saw in
that girls finger

646
00:54:05,642 --> 00:54:06,108
Yes.

647
00:54:07,477 --> 00:54:08,102
Is there anybody?

648
00:54:09,145 --> 00:54:11,443
Find out, where will Mr. Vishambar das
be available at this time

649
00:54:19,823 --> 00:54:22,621
Shalu, just give me the ring?

650
00:54:32,669 --> 00:54:34,637
Give a deep thought, and think
once again

651
00:54:38,008 --> 00:54:39,134
Let me know,
What the matter is?

652
00:54:39,843 --> 00:54:42,141
The thing is that this ring
is thevished

653
00:54:43,847 --> 00:54:46,475
Shalu, was this also left to be
heard of Amar

654
00:54:47,684 --> 00:54:48,651
Who is this Amar?

655
00:54:51,354 --> 00:54:51,979
Mr. Commissioner...

656
00:54:55,358 --> 00:54:58,327
Is this the time for a decent
man to come home-

657
00:54:58,528 --> 00:54:59,495
Ask him, what he
wants?

658
00:55:01,364 --> 00:55:02,661
Tell that, I have come to
return the car back

659
00:55:03,033 --> 00:55:03,658
Take the keys

660
00:55:03,867 --> 00:55:06,165
And tell, thankyou so much
for using the car

661
00:55:06,536 --> 00:55:07,833
Ask him, what was
the hurry?

662
00:55:08,038 --> 00:55:09,335
He could have used it for
3-4 days more

663
00:55:10,206 --> 00:55:11,332
Tell her, that I am feeling
very thirsty-

664
00:55:11,508 --> 00:55:13,669
Will she ask for something to drink
or should I leave?

665
00:55:14,878 --> 00:55:17,005
Ask him if he has come here
to quench his thirst-

666
00:55:17,213 --> 00:55:19,477
Then what was he doing the
whole day with her?

667
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:21,347
Tell her that I was
increasing my thirst-

668
00:55:21,518 --> 00:55:22,348
Now I have come
to quench it

669
00:55:29,059 --> 00:55:30,026
He's come to
quench it

670
00:55:41,071 --> 00:55:42,038
Has the thirst
got quenched?

671
00:55:43,073 --> 00:55:44,199
Pour a little bit on
yourself too-

672
00:55:44,407 --> 00:55:46,705
So that the fire of your anger
also gets extinguished

673
00:55:49,245 --> 00:55:50,542
Why do you trouble me so much?

674
00:55:54,751 --> 00:55:57,549
In reality if this Amar's face
is identical to my son-

675
00:55:58,088 --> 00:56:00,716
Then to catch hold of him, should
not be of a difficult task

676
00:56:01,758 --> 00:56:02,926
Meanwhile, you keep this
ring with you-

677
00:56:02,959 --> 00:56:07,556
If required, you'll have to take
pains of coming to the station

678
00:56:07,931 --> 00:56:08,556
Yes, definitely

679
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:10,224
Shalu, take it

680
00:56:17,107 --> 00:56:17,732
Yes

681
00:57:10,493 --> 00:57:12,120
Hear there are uncut diamonds
worth lakhs

682
00:57:12,495 --> 00:57:14,463
Everynight the job of cutting
used to take place

683
00:57:15,331 --> 00:57:18,630
But, from few days one of my
crafts man has fallen sick-

684
00:57:19,002 --> 00:57:20,299
And the other has gone
on a holiday

685
00:57:21,004 --> 00:57:22,972
Now you suggest me as to
what should I do?

686
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:26,468
Because, I cannot trust upon
a new person

687
00:57:52,869 --> 00:57:53,995
Will you be able to
trust me?

688
00:57:54,204 --> 00:57:56,832
Vinay, from today your salary
will be double

689
00:57:57,707 --> 00:57:59,675
From tomorrow you can take
an off in the morning

690
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:03,509
Because this work will be done
in the night after the shop closes

691
00:58:04,214 --> 00:58:05,181
From when are
you starting?

692
00:58:05,381 --> 00:58:06,177
You tell me

693
00:58:06,883 --> 00:58:07,679
Tomorrow by 9 'O' clock

694
00:58:08,384 --> 00:58:10,852
I'll wait for you
outside the shop

695
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:15,516
The time is 8:30

696
00:58:17,393 --> 00:58:17,859
So

697
00:58:18,561 --> 00:58:19,687
I have to reach
by 9 'O' clock

698
00:58:22,732 --> 00:58:23,528
Should I leave?

699
00:58:26,236 --> 00:58:27,032
Your wish

700
00:58:29,239 --> 00:58:32,697
I thought that you would tell me
to stop for some more time

701
00:58:34,911 --> 00:58:36,208
Had I told, would you
have stopped?

702
00:58:36,579 --> 00:58:38,206
Why don't you say once and, see it
for yourself

703
00:58:38,414 --> 00:58:39,711
What will I do telling?

704
00:58:40,583 --> 00:58:43,051
What ever I had to say
the destiny has told it

705
00:58:45,255 --> 00:58:46,722
And what about that which
I have to say?

706
00:58:48,091 --> 00:58:49,058
It's better if you
don't say

707
00:58:54,097 --> 00:58:55,223
Is your name
Shalini?

708
00:58:55,431 --> 00:58:56,056
Yes, tell me

709
00:58:56,432 --> 00:58:57,057
This letter

710
00:59:11,281 --> 00:59:11,747
Brother

711
00:59:12,282 --> 00:59:12,748
Yes

712
00:59:13,616 --> 00:59:14,082
Where is he?

713
00:59:14,284 --> 00:59:14,750
Please come

714
00:59:19,122 --> 00:59:20,089
Shalu, what's the matter?

715
00:59:21,457 --> 00:59:21,718
Arey, we have to go to the party,
where is she going?

716
00:59:23,626 --> 00:59:24,593
I don't know, one man had
brought a letter

717
00:59:24,961 --> 00:59:25,928
What letter, just
read it

718
00:59:29,299 --> 00:59:32,598
I immidietly want to meet you
come with this man

719
00:59:32,969 --> 00:59:34,436
I am not waiting
in the car

720
00:59:35,972 --> 00:59:37,098
That scowndrel has
again come

721
00:59:37,307 --> 00:59:38,774
I don't know when this girl
will get matured?

722
00:59:38,975 --> 00:59:41,978
She has again gone
to him

723
00:59:42,011 --> 00:59:43,104
His intentions are
not good-

724
00:59:43,313 --> 00:59:44,109
Otherwise, wouldn't he had
come into the house

725
00:59:44,314 --> 00:59:45,110
Why did he call her
outside?

726
00:59:45,815 --> 00:59:47,612
Go and stop her, otherwise she'll
again come into his trap

727
00:59:48,151 --> 00:59:49,118
I'll change my clothes
and come

728
00:59:56,993 --> 01:00:02,124
Leave me, leave me, brother...
leave me

729
01:00:17,847 --> 01:00:18,814
My ring

730
01:00:19,682 --> 01:00:20,808
The same ring

731
01:00:22,185 --> 01:00:23,812
Did you see any of the
Rowdies face?

732
01:00:27,357 --> 01:00:28,153
Okay I'll leave-

733
01:00:28,858 --> 01:00:29,654
Otherwise sir would tell-

734
01:00:29,826 --> 01:00:31,157
That I am late by one and a half
hour, on the very first day itself

735
01:01:03,559 --> 01:01:04,355
Is sir in the house?

736
01:01:07,397 --> 01:01:08,022
Come in

737
01:01:11,401 --> 01:01:12,527
Is he angry with me?

738
01:01:13,736 --> 01:01:15,203
His eyes were showing
the anger

739
01:01:17,073 --> 01:01:18,370
Actually I got late

740
01:01:22,245 --> 01:01:23,542
Sit down, I'll just
send him

741
01:02:36,652 --> 01:02:37,118
Sir

742
01:07:42,458 --> 01:07:43,425
You, here

743
01:07:43,626 --> 01:07:46,754
Sir, I came here for appologising
I couldn't reach at the right time

744
01:07:47,129 --> 01:07:48,096
What are you
blabbering?

745
01:07:48,631 --> 01:07:51,099
For the last 2 hours you were
sitting with me and cutting diamonds

746
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:53,928
Just 10 minutes ago, I dropped you
outside and left-

747
01:07:54,103 --> 01:07:56,435
Because you told me that I'll
work till the morning

748
01:07:56,806 --> 01:07:58,103
Sir, what are you
talking?

749
01:07:58,641 --> 01:08:00,268
For the last half-an-hour
I was here

750
01:08:00,476 --> 01:08:00,942
Yes, daddy

751
01:08:01,811 --> 01:08:04,609
BY 10:30 when I reached
the shop, the door was closed

752
01:08:05,481 --> 01:08:07,278
I thought probably you had left
after waiting for a long

753
01:08:07,483 --> 01:08:08,950
So, I took a taxi and straight away
came here

754
01:08:09,151 --> 01:08:10,448
You are lying

755
01:08:11,821 --> 01:08:15,120
It was 5 minutes to 9, and you
reached there

756
01:08:15,491 --> 01:08:17,288
I told, Vinay you are
very puntual

757
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:20,629
You told me sir, how could I
come late on the very first day?

758
01:08:21,163 --> 01:08:22,960
After which we had closed the
door from inside

759
01:08:23,165 --> 01:08:24,962
Sir, I was not there
I was not there

760
01:08:25,167 --> 01:08:26,293
IF you were not there, then
who was there?

761
01:08:48,524 --> 01:08:49,650
I am ruined

762
01:08:49,859 --> 01:08:50,154
Sir.

763
01:08:50,526 --> 01:08:51,322
I am ruined

764
01:08:52,194 --> 01:08:52,990
I am ruined

765
01:08:54,530 --> 01:08:55,428
I am ruined

766
01:08:56,198 --> 01:08:57,165
I'll call the doctor

767
01:08:57,366 --> 01:08:59,994
Not the doctor
but police, police

768
01:09:09,879 --> 01:09:13,337
He was seated there,
and I was hore

769
01:09:14,717 --> 01:09:17,185
How did I know, that
he was Amar

770
01:09:19,722 --> 01:09:22,020
Vishambar do you
remember-

771
01:09:22,224 --> 01:09:25,022
That in your party myself and Anju
mistook Vinay to be Amar

772
01:09:25,227 --> 01:09:25,693
Yes,

773
01:09:26,395 --> 01:09:28,192
From the time Mr. Commissioner
has told-

774
01:09:28,564 --> 01:09:30,532
That the ring given by Amar
was of thieved-

775
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:33,527
From then, my mind is only
pondering on Amar's movements

776
01:09:35,237 --> 01:09:37,034
He used to avoid giving answers
for so many questions

777
01:09:37,406 --> 01:09:39,033
For exemple, where does
the hail from? -

778
01:09:39,241 --> 01:09:41,209
Who his parents were,
what work he does?

779
01:09:41,911 --> 01:09:45,210
And the second thing was that he
never used to stick on to one place

780
01:09:45,748 --> 01:09:47,545
Sometimes in Delhi, sometimes in Calcutta
sometimes in Bombay-

781
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:48,717
Sometimes here
sometimes there-

782
01:09:48,918 --> 01:09:50,385
Suddenly he used to come, suddenly
he used to get disappeared

783
01:09:51,086 --> 01:09:53,384
But there is no doubt that
now-a-days he is in Bombay

784
01:09:53,756 --> 01:09:54,723
The moment he came
to know-

785
01:09:54,924 --> 01:09:56,721
That the ring which he gave has
become the evidence of his theft-

786
01:09:56,926 --> 01:09:59,224
He has sent rowdies to
attac on Shalu

787
01:09:59,428 --> 01:10:00,554
Now Mr. Commissioner, you
yourself think

788
01:10:00,763 --> 01:10:03,561
There were gold bangels, a costly
watch and a diamonds necklace

789
01:10:03,933 --> 01:10:05,059
He didn't touch
on those-

790
01:10:05,267 --> 01:10:05,801
He only snatched away
the ring

791
01:10:06,834 --> 01:10:07,769
But why?

792
01:10:07,802 --> 01:10:09,360
You mean to say, that this Amar
is the same jewel thief-

793
01:10:10,272 --> 01:10:11,398
Whom we are in
search of

794
01:10:13,609 --> 01:10:14,735
How can I tell
this?

795
01:10:15,277 --> 01:10:17,905
May be he is the same,
may be not

796
01:10:27,623 --> 01:10:29,250
Leave me, it's not
my fault

797
01:10:29,792 --> 01:10:31,760
How long have you been here?
Who are you?

798
01:10:31,961 --> 01:10:33,588
I am a small robber, I'll not
do it again

799
01:10:34,129 --> 01:10:36,427
You are not a robber but you have
come here for hearing our talk-

800
01:10:37,466 --> 01:10:40,094
Who has sent you here? Whom do you work for?

801
01:10:40,970 --> 01:10:42,437
Tell me, otherwise I'll
strangle your neck

802
01:10:42,638 --> 01:10:45,607
I'll tell, I'll tell, but leave my
neck, leave my neck

803
01:10:45,808 --> 01:10:47,776
I am a poor man, I was
given money

804
01:10:49,478 --> 01:10:50,103
How much money?

805
01:10:50,312 --> 01:10:50,778
100 Rupees.

806
01:10:51,313 --> 01:10:52,109
Who gave it
to you?

807
01:10:52,481 --> 01:10:55,450
I didn't see his face, it was dark
there was a mask on his face

808
01:10:55,985 --> 01:10:57,782
You know it,
you are lying

809
01:11:00,990 --> 01:11:03,788
Tell, otherwise I'll
break your bones

810
01:11:04,493 --> 01:11:05,289
My hand...

811
01:11:05,995 --> 01:11:09,453
And if you tell me the truth, then
even I'll give you 100 rupees

812
01:11:10,499 --> 01:11:11,124
100 Rupees

813
01:11:11,333 --> 01:11:11,958
100 Rupees

814
01:11:12,167 --> 01:11:12,792
First give it

815
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:22,139
First give the
answer.

816
01:11:22,678 --> 01:11:24,646
His name
his name is Amar

817
01:11:27,182 --> 01:11:29,980
Although his friends call him
by the name Prince

818
01:11:30,352 --> 01:11:31,819
I have no relation
with him

819
01:11:32,021 --> 01:11:34,148
I haven't met him till date,
his Girl friend has sent me here

820
01:11:34,356 --> 01:11:34,822
Who Girl friend?

821
01:11:35,858 --> 01:11:37,985
By the name Roman night club
those in a night club

822
01:11:38,193 --> 01:11:42,323
On every sunday night the
Girl... who dances there...

823
01:16:46,335 --> 01:16:48,803
Sir, the lift has gone till
the 5th floor

824
01:17:23,872 --> 01:17:25,169
First, switch on
the light

825
01:17:44,226 --> 01:17:48,026
Arey, yesterday how did you
forget your pipe?

826
01:17:52,734 --> 01:17:55,362
Even I was thinking that where
did it get disappeared!

827
01:18:05,747 --> 01:18:10,207
Darling, you make a drink,
I'll freshen up and come

828
01:19:24,993 --> 01:19:26,119
Change your clothes
later

829
01:19:26,328 --> 01:19:27,795
Not the clothes, I was
just changing my shoes

830
01:19:28,497 --> 01:19:29,623
Come let's sit
outside

831
01:19:33,168 --> 01:19:34,135
You haven't made
the drinks

832
01:19:49,017 --> 01:19:51,144
Darling, take out some
ice pleace

833
01:20:01,530 --> 01:20:02,656
Sir, What will you
take?

834
01:20:03,031 --> 01:20:04,157
Madam, what ever you
give

835
01:20:39,734 --> 01:20:42,862
Drink, and remember me

836
01:20:44,239 --> 01:20:47,367
I'll sit and drink
and remember

837
01:20:49,411 --> 01:20:50,036
Come

838
01:21:08,430 --> 01:21:08,896
Drink

839
01:21:12,767 --> 01:21:13,734
First you drink

840
01:21:26,948 --> 01:21:29,917
The entire wearines vanishes
in your arms

841
01:21:48,970 --> 01:21:50,267
Who could be at
this hour?

842
01:22:09,991 --> 01:22:11,618
Did you send a telegram
from pune?

843
01:22:11,826 --> 01:22:12,121
Let me see

844
01:22:15,664 --> 01:22:18,132
In this it's written that you are
going to come to night 2 'O' clock

845
01:22:18,667 --> 01:22:19,793
How did you come
early?

846
01:22:20,669 --> 01:22:21,465
My intention was
this-

847
01:22:21,670 --> 01:22:22,967
But after sending the telegram,
I thought

848
01:22:23,505 --> 01:22:25,632
Why don't I reach a little
early to see you

849
01:22:26,341 --> 01:22:30,300
Lier, come let's finish our drink,
and then we'll go to sleep

850
01:22:47,862 --> 01:22:48,829
Please open the zip

851
01:22:50,532 --> 01:22:51,328
Open it

852
01:23:04,546 --> 01:23:05,513
Close your eyes.
