1
00:01:25,812 --> 00:01:26,972
Take it out.

2
00:01:27,113 --> 00:01:29,581
No, sir. I won't take it out.

3
00:01:29,716 --> 00:01:32,116
I'll go to hell if I touched it.

4
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:34,077
You take it.

5
00:01:43,129 --> 00:01:45,154
We'r e extremely sorry, sir.

6
00:01:45,465 --> 00:01:47,695
It's not our bank's fault, sir.

7
00:01:47,901 --> 00:01:49,664
We sent many reminders..

8
00:01:50,436 --> 00:01:51,926
..but nobody came to collect it.

9
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:18,013
DDR -=KaMaL=-

10
00:03:46,953 --> 00:03:49,979
Second round. -They are going to lose
again.

11
00:03:52,692 --> 00:03:53,989
Push up.

12
00:03:55,995 --> 00:03:58,122
Come, come. Come on.

13
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:02,031
Hurry up. What are you doing?

14
00:04:03,836 --> 00:04:08,864
Buck up, Doctor. Otherwise I'll have to bear
your expenses as well

15
00:04:09,242 --> 00:04:11,676
I'm coming. - Don't just walk. Run.

16
00:04:11,778 --> 00:04:12,802
Yes, I'm coming.

17
00:04:15,915 --> 00:04:20,181
What is this? We lose every time because
of this physician.

18
00:04:20,353 --> 00:04:22,651
Look at him!

19
00:04:23,723 --> 00:04:24,883
Come, come.

20
00:04:24,991 --> 00:04:27,926
Physician, do try your remedies on yourself
too.

21
00:04:28,027 --> 00:04:30,120
You've lost again. - We beat you.

22
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:31,321
Sit. Sit.

23
00:04:31,597 --> 00:04:32,894
Now there's no hurry.

24
00:04:32,999 --> 00:04:36,628
Quick, empty your pockets. Hurry up.

25
00:04:36,736 --> 00:04:38,567
Hold on. What's the hurry?

26
00:04:38,671 --> 00:04:40,935
Hurry up. - Come on.

27
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,305
Here. Give this to him. - Her e.

28
00:04:44,777 --> 00:04:46,608
This is just for breakfast. What about tea?

29
00:04:46,779 --> 00:04:50,146
Here. I'll pay for the tea.

30
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:53,650
Hashmat, from tomorrow onwards I'll be in
your team.

31
00:04:53,753 --> 00:04:55,084
These people walk too slowly.

32
00:04:55,188 --> 00:05:00,820
Fine. Next time, come on my team and
defeat them. - Thanks.

33
00:05:01,127 --> 00:05:04,062
Keep him with you. We don't want such a
weak player.

34
00:05:04,163 --> 00:05:06,154
What? I'm weak?

35
00:05:06,265 --> 00:05:07,755
As if you all are very str ong.

36
00:05:07,867 --> 00:05:10,597
Today don't say anything. Eat this apple.

37
00:05:10,703 --> 00:05:14,366
It'll restore your lost youth. So that next
time we win.

38
00:05:17,143 --> 00:05:21,102
Your habit of eating an apple everyday,
instilled by Dr. Banerjee..

39
00:05:21,214 --> 00:05:22,647
..is what makes you win everyday.

40
00:05:22,749 --> 00:05:24,341
Hats off to doctor sahab

41
00:05:24,684 --> 00:05:27,312
They give a lot of good advice. It's me who
can't follow it.

42
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,081
You are lucky, Hashmat.

43
00:05:29,689 --> 00:05:31,350
You have Dr. Banerjee with you.

44
00:05:31,691 --> 00:05:34,660
We have this doctor.

45
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,029
What happened?

46
00:05:40,099 --> 00:05:41,225
Who asked you to catch the ball?

47
00:05:41,334 --> 00:05:43,029
It was my third boundary in a row. You've
broken my hat-trick r ecord.

48
00:05:43,202 --> 00:05:45,363
Sorry.

49
00:05:45,705 --> 00:05:49,801
Dear, he thought it's an apple and not a
ball.

50
00:05:51,911 --> 00:05:54,880
What good is a record of hat-trick
boundaries?

51
00:05:54,981 --> 00:05:59,714
Br eak Shaheed Afridi's record for the
fastest century if you want to. - Yes.

52
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:02,049
Go and play.

53
00:06:02,155 --> 00:06:03,884
Well said.

54
00:06:04,056 --> 00:06:09,153
Nobody can beat the Pakistani team in
making and breaking records.

55
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:10,352
Remember?

56
00:06:10,663 --> 00:06:15,123
The last ball's six hit by Javed Miandad in
Sharjah.

57
00:06:15,234 --> 00:06:19,967
Yes. If the Pakistani team's two to four
players join your team..

58
00:06:20,072 --> 00:06:22,267
..then you'll surely defeat us.

59
00:06:23,476 --> 00:06:25,808
The Pakistani team is truly the best team.

60
00:06:25,912 --> 00:06:29,006
But Sachin is a cut above the rest.

61
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:32,714
Hello, Mr. Rizvi.

62
00:06:33,252 --> 00:06:34,810
Tell me.

63
00:06:35,054 --> 00:06:36,316
In Lucknow?

64
00:06:36,789 --> 00:06:38,256
Why?

65
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:41,353
Okay.

66
00:06:42,929 --> 00:06:46,296
I've always finished your work on time.

67
00:06:48,768 --> 00:06:50,235
A big order?

68
00:06:50,503 --> 00:06:51,697
Fine.

69
00:06:51,804 --> 00:06:53,738
Send it. I'll finish it.

70
00:06:54,173 --> 00:06:56,733
Yes. Thanks.

71
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:58,837
Bye.

72
00:07:14,527 --> 00:07:15,994
Leaving early?

73
00:07:16,496 --> 00:07:18,726
Yes, Father. I have some urgent work.

74
00:07:18,898 --> 00:07:22,891
At least wash your bike. It's so dirty.

75
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:29,933
You should look after your vehicle the way
you look after your childr en.

76
00:07:30,042 --> 00:07:32,101
Only then will both of them be healthy

77
00:07:32,211 --> 00:07:33,371
The vehicle, as well as you.

78
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:35,504
May I leave, Father? - Yes.

79
00:07:35,815 --> 00:07:38,147
Don't press the accelerator too hard.

80
00:07:40,987 --> 00:07:42,318
Bye, Father.

81
00:07:42,822 --> 00:07:44,187
Shut up. Just shut up!

82
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:46,087
It might be happening at your place.

83
00:07:46,192 --> 00:07:47,750
Our servants are not like that.

84
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:53,462
Better be careful from next time before
entering my room.

85
00:07:53,566 --> 00:07:56,729
Okay, don't shout. He won't do it again.

86
00:07:56,836 --> 00:07:58,895
Now what are you looking at, get out.

87
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:01,404
Mevalal, please leave.

88
00:08:01,507 --> 00:08:02,940
Rafat

89
00:08:03,042 --> 00:08:04,407
No, its not your fault, we are responsible
for everything.

90
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:07,001
Coming, Father. Yes, Father.

91
00:08:07,113 --> 00:08:10,742
Go and load Mr. Kuswala's stuff in the
machine. - Okay.

92
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:12,010
I'll just come. - Okay.

93
00:08:12,118 --> 00:08:13,346
Aara.

94
00:08:14,854 --> 00:08:16,515
Aara.

95
00:08:17,256 --> 00:08:18,450
Aara.

96
00:08:19,258 --> 00:08:22,750
Aara. - She is not yet dead. She is coming.

97
00:08:23,262 --> 00:08:25,753
What's God punishing us for?

98
00:08:26,299 --> 00:08:29,359
Now when we are hale and hearty then
our plight is like this.

99
00:08:29,869 --> 00:08:32,565
These people might throw us out when
we'll grow old.

100
00:08:32,872 --> 00:08:35,067
Then they should have thrown us out a
long time ago.

101
00:08:35,174 --> 00:08:38,075
I don't like this unnecessary bickering.

102
00:08:38,377 --> 00:08:39,935
It's all your doing.

103
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:43,544
I told you r epeatedly not to marry her into
a family based in Lucknow.

104
00:08:43,883 --> 00:08:45,976
Now suffer.

105
00:08:46,252 --> 00:08:48,550
Hear her English nonsense the whole day.

106
00:08:48,854 --> 00:08:51,584
We won't understand it even if she abuses
us.

107
00:08:52,892 --> 00:08:54,223
What ar e you searching for?

108
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:58,590
I wore your specs by mistake. Both look
similar.

109
00:08:58,864 --> 00:09:00,798
What do I do with this bunch of postcar ds?

110
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,527
I have to take it to the shop.

111
00:09:06,539 --> 00:09:09,201
Hasmat, again, the same postcards?

112
00:09:09,342 --> 00:09:12,072
You should have written on plain paper..

113
00:09:12,278 --> 00:09:15,406
..and then got it photocopied from
Khayali's shop.

114
00:09:15,881 --> 00:09:17,872
'Ther e is commotion everywhere.'

115
00:09:18,317 --> 00:09:19,841
'Ther e is commotion everywhere.'

116
00:09:19,952 --> 00:09:23,046
'Find out what's the matter.' - Is that so?

117
00:09:23,289 --> 00:09:26,918
'Find out why the fire's still burning.'

118
00:09:28,027 --> 00:09:30,962
'The person who was sharing the
destination's whereabouts.'

119
00:09:31,063 --> 00:09:32,530
'The person who was sharing..'

120
00:09:32,632 --> 00:09:34,122
'..the destination's whereabouts.'

121
00:09:34,233 --> 00:09:36,167
Nobody knows where he is. Find out.

122
00:09:36,268 --> 00:09:39,101
Well said. Well said, Hashmat.

123
00:09:39,205 --> 00:09:40,638
That's the reality of today's times.

124
00:09:40,973 --> 00:09:43,498
Small, beautiful and cheap.

125
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:46,235
It says a lot in a few words.

126
00:09:46,612 --> 00:09:48,637
Nothing to hide.

127
00:09:49,915 --> 00:09:51,109
Very good. - Here.

128
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,842
Keep it in the box.

129
00:09:52,952 --> 00:09:54,419
And please check the matter

130
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:58,149
Otherwise Mr. Kasuri will get a chance to
point out flaws.

131
00:09:58,557 --> 00:10:00,388
You've prefixed his name with 'Nawab',
haven't you?

132
00:10:00,626 --> 00:10:02,594
There won't be any problem.

133
00:10:05,197 --> 00:10:09,861
'Chaudha Peer..yearly..'

134
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:12,560
Read it properly.

135
00:10:13,406 --> 00:10:16,534
In the yearly celebrations of chaudha Peer..

136
00:10:16,642 --> 00:10:17,939
..enjoy a performance of Sufi renditions..

137
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:23,605
Chairman, Nawab..Mohammed Ali Kasuri.

138
00:10:25,051 --> 00:10:26,382
Maulana(Priest of the mosque) Abdul
Qayyum..

139
00:10:26,652 --> 00:10:28,142
..Querishi ..General secretary, Hashmat
Allah

140
00:10:28,287 --> 00:10:29,515
Read it properly.

141
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:32,623
Why are you so scar ed of Kasuri?

142
00:10:32,992 --> 00:10:34,357
You are also the general secretary.

143
00:10:35,428 --> 00:10:39,091
Hashmat, this time you should contest the
election for the chairman's post.

144
00:10:39,298 --> 00:10:40,629
You'll surely win.

145
00:10:41,033 --> 00:10:44,059
We'r e ther e with you. We'll ensur e that you
win.

146
00:10:44,203 --> 00:10:46,398
No way. Did you forget?

147
00:10:46,505 --> 00:10:49,167
A long time ago my elder brother had
defeated him in the elections.

148
00:10:49,308 --> 00:10:51,708
We'r e not on talking terms till date.

149
00:10:52,311 --> 00:10:54,176
It's all in his head.

150
00:10:54,513 --> 00:10:57,710
They wer e thick friends.

151
00:10:58,317 --> 00:11:00,512
Yet, he didn't even attend brother's
funeral.

152
00:11:01,053 --> 00:11:03,385
I don't want to repeat all that.

153
00:11:03,589 --> 00:11:06,057
You people have honoured me..

154
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:08,049
..by electing me as secr etary.

155
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,185
Otherwise I don't have any desires.

156
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:13,921
You should stay at bay from rich people.

157
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:19,695
I've heard that once a str eet dog didn't eat
butter offered by his father.

158
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:22,202
He shot him.

159
00:11:22,441 --> 00:11:24,636
Your brother used to work there.

160
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:29,338
How can these people tolerate their
servant defeating them?

161
00:11:29,448 --> 00:11:31,473
Mr. Kasuri has come. - Wher e?

162
00:11:32,585 --> 00:11:34,746
Got scared?

163
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,988
Are you joking?

164
00:11:37,456 --> 00:11:38,650
Hindustan Engineering Works?

165
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:40,088
Yes. Tell me.

166
00:11:40,426 --> 00:11:42,485
Mr. Rizvi has sent us.

167
00:11:42,595 --> 00:11:44,995
Yes. Have you brought the engine?

168
00:11:45,097 --> 00:11:46,223
Yes.

169
00:11:46,332 --> 00:11:48,698
Bring it. Bring it here.

170
00:11:50,503 --> 00:11:51,697
There.

171
00:11:52,138 --> 00:11:53,162
The power is back.

172
00:11:53,272 --> 00:11:54,569
Now move on, he will be busy now in his
work.

173
00:11:55,074 --> 00:11:59,010
Okay, okay. We're leaving. Even we have
loads of work to do.

174
00:11:59,645 --> 00:12:02,341
Salim. Write the name on the engine.

175
00:12:02,748 --> 00:12:04,306
Okay, Mr. Hashmat.

176
00:12:06,118 --> 00:12:08,382
It's in very bad condition.

177
00:12:08,487 --> 00:12:09,749
Can't it be r epaired?

178
00:12:10,189 --> 00:12:12,316
Why not?

179
00:12:14,026 --> 00:12:17,587
I think this is a Ford V8 engine. What do
you say, Z ulfi?

180
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:20,529
I too think so. Double head engine.

181
00:12:20,633 --> 00:12:23,796
Either Mr. Belwarial or Mr. Rizvi would
know.

182
00:12:24,637 --> 00:12:28,095
Is there a steel guard in front of the car?

183
00:12:28,207 --> 00:12:29,367
Yes.

184
00:12:29,542 --> 00:12:33,478
I'm sure this is a 60 to 7 0-year-old engine
of a lorry.

185
00:12:33,579 --> 00:12:36,104
Yes. It's a museum car.

186
00:12:37,116 --> 00:12:39,482
Sir.

187
00:12:39,685 --> 00:12:42,586
Are you the owner or an employee?

188
00:12:42,688 --> 00:12:44,212
I don't understand.

189
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:48,184
I wanted to know what work you do.

190
00:12:49,595 --> 00:12:53,156
In Eng lish, I'm a matriculation failed
mechanical engineer.

191
00:12:53,365 --> 00:12:55,560
In Hindi, I'm a skilled labourer.

192
00:12:55,668 --> 00:12:57,636
He is Hashmat.

193
00:12:58,604 --> 00:13:00,094
Oh.

194
00:13:01,073 --> 00:13:05,635
Sorry. Mr. Sinha is very strict about
work-related matters.

195
00:13:05,811 --> 00:13:09,372
And this is a very important job. It has to
be finished soon. So..

196
00:13:09,481 --> 00:13:13,110
Don't worry. It will be done. I've spoken to
Mr. Rizvi.

197
00:13:13,319 --> 00:13:16,584
Then there's nothing to worry about. Still,
finish it soon.

198
00:13:16,789 --> 00:13:19,223
Surely. - Bye.

199
00:13:19,592 --> 00:13:22,686
Take it inside.

200
00:13:24,563 --> 00:13:28,329
''He left in the morning.''

201
00:13:28,801 --> 00:13:37,402
''If he didn't return by evening..''

202
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:52,384
''It didn't occur to me to call him
forgotten.''

203
00:13:53,826 --> 00:14:07,604
''Why couldn't I comprehend the one
whom I worship?''

204
00:14:08,207 --> 00:14:15,375
''I've been praying to Him since a lifetime.''

205
00:14:15,648 --> 00:14:22,451
''Why can't I still see the result?''

206
00:14:47,613 --> 00:14:52,676
''Show us astray people the way to our
home.''

207
00:14:52,785 --> 00:14:57,688
''Show us lost souls the way home.''

208
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:02,352
''Show us lost souls the way home.''

209
00:15:02,761 --> 00:15:07,664
''Almighty God, teach us how to live.''

210
00:15:07,766 --> 00:15:12,499
''Almighty God, teach us how to live.''

211
00:15:12,604 --> 00:15:17,803
''What merriment have you acquired?''

212
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,878
''Which you have acquired.''

213
00:15:19,979 --> 00:15:22,709
''Which you have acquired.''

214
00:15:22,815 --> 00:15:25,340
''On us. A shred.''

215
00:15:25,451 --> 00:15:27,783
''A shred. A shred.''

216
00:15:27,886 --> 00:15:32,789
''Shower a shred of Your grace on us too.''

217
00:15:32,891 --> 00:15:37,828
''Shower a shred of Your grace on us too.''

218
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:41,593
''Show us astray people..''

219
00:15:45,804 --> 00:15:46,896
Hello, Mr. Ali.

220
00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:48,729
Hello.

221
00:15:48,841 --> 00:15:49,830
Hello.

222
00:15:49,942 --> 00:15:52,308
Mr. Inayat Ali, you all didn't wait for me?

223
00:15:52,411 --> 00:15:54,311
Are you were in hurry to go home?

224
00:15:54,813 --> 00:15:58,340
They wer e about to leave. So..Hasmat
asked them to start.

225
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:00,884
What better can I expect from him?

226
00:16:01,053 --> 00:16:02,350
Come, Maulana. - Come.

227
00:16:02,488 --> 00:16:03,512
Have a seat.

228
00:16:03,622 --> 00:16:04,680
Sit.

229
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:06,314
Sit.

230
00:16:11,463 --> 00:16:12,521
Yes..start it

231
00:16:12,631 --> 00:16:16,897
''Har d-earned living no longer exists.''

232
00:16:17,002 --> 00:16:21,666
''Straight forward hearts have ceased to
exist.''

233
00:16:21,774 --> 00:16:27,371
''All the elders have left their families.''

234
00:16:27,646 --> 00:16:32,709
''Old tr ees are not to be seen outside.''

235
00:16:33,052 --> 00:16:37,580
''Who will narrate fairytales?''

236
00:16:37,689 --> 00:16:42,683
''There are no grandparents, nor
grandchildr en.''

237
00:16:42,795 --> 00:16:47,562
''Everybody swears to God by these times.''

238
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:52,000
''Darkness has replaced light.''

239
00:16:52,404 --> 00:16:56,898
''Everybody swears to God, what times ar e
these?''

240
00:16:57,009 --> 00:17:02,447
''Darkness has replaced light.''

241
00:17:04,316 --> 00:17:08,446
''Religion is at risk. We're out to save it. -
We're out.''

242
00:17:08,554 --> 00:17:09,851
''Religious people are out..''

243
00:17:09,955 --> 00:17:12,719
''..to assert their religion. - They are out.''

244
00:17:12,825 --> 00:17:16,955
''Their blood shot eyes are ready to see
bloodshed. -They ar e ready.''

245
00:17:17,062 --> 00:17:21,055
''Immatur e people are r eady to burn their
houses. - They are out.''

246
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:25,394
''Immatur e people are r eady to burn their
houses. - They are out.''

247
00:17:25,504 --> 00:17:29,941
''Insensible people want to burn their
houses.''

248
00:17:31,343 --> 00:17:33,504
''Oh, God. Oh, Lord.''

249
00:17:33,612 --> 00:17:36,479
''Oh, God. Oh, Lord.''

250
00:17:36,582 --> 00:17:38,641
''Oh, God. Oh, Lord.''

251
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,514
''Oh, God. Oh, Lord.''

252
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:44,054
''Do shower.. - Oh, God.''

253
00:17:44,156 --> 00:17:46,647
''..your mercy on us. - Oh, God.''

254
00:17:46,758 --> 00:17:51,752
''Now do shower Your mercy on us.''

255
00:17:51,864 --> 00:17:56,927
''Do hear our prayers too.''

256
00:17:57,035 --> 00:17:59,060
''Asking for forgiveness and then again
committing a crime.''

257
00:17:59,171 --> 00:18:01,935
''Asking for forgiveness and then again
committing a crime.''

258
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,406
''Everything is haywire.''

259
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:07,138
''Please put things right.''

260
00:18:07,412 --> 00:18:10,609
''Oh, God. Oh, Lord.''

261
00:18:10,716 --> 00:18:14,015
Next year on Id(Muslim festival) we'll invite
Ghulam Ali.

262
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:16,587
Good. - Yes.

263
00:18:16,688 --> 00:18:19,851
''Oh, God. Oh, Lord.''

264
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:24,725
Why does the Maulana follow Kasuri
wher ever he goes?

265
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:27,856
You need money for everything in the
world.

266
00:18:27,966 --> 00:18:30,935
How long can he survive alone?

267
00:18:31,537 --> 00:18:36,668
''Hatred, evil, sin, immorality.''

268
00:18:37,009 --> 00:18:41,708
''How did You win this war? Tell us.''

269
00:18:41,813 --> 00:18:46,841
''How did You win this war? Tell us.''

270
00:18:46,952 --> 00:18:49,546
''Shower a shred. - Shower a shred.''

271
00:18:49,655 --> 00:18:51,953
''Shower a shred. - Shower a shred.''

272
00:18:52,057 --> 00:18:57,017
''Shower a shred of Your grace on us too.''

273
00:18:57,129 --> 00:19:00,826
''Shower a shred of Your grace on us too.''

274
00:19:00,933 --> 00:19:05,996
''Show us astray people the way to our
home.''

275
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:11,098
''Show us astray people the way to our
home.''

276
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:16,079
''Show us astray people the way to our
home.''

277
00:19:16,181 --> 00:19:21,209
''Almighty God, teach us how to live.''

278
00:19:21,486 --> 00:19:26,185
''Almighty God, teach us how to live.''

279
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:31,191
''Shower a shred of Your grace on us too.''

280
00:19:31,463 --> 00:19:36,127
''Shower a shred of Your grace on us too.''

281
00:19:36,235 --> 00:19:41,867
''Shower a shred of Your grace on us too.''

282
00:19:41,974 --> 00:19:44,204
''Oh, God.''

283
00:19:46,845 --> 00:19:50,440
Harder. It's an American machine.

284
00:19:50,649 --> 00:19:52,879
It needs more of the Indian toil to open up.

285
00:19:53,585 --> 00:19:56,281
I don't think all the parts ar e intact.

286
00:19:56,555 --> 00:19:59,353
It'll take a week just to open it.

287
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:01,585
No. I think it's difficult to repair it.

288
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,627
It's difficult, not impossible.

289
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:07,455
I was saying it because again you'll try to
r epair it..

290
00:20:07,566 --> 00:20:09,431
..and ruin your health.

291
00:20:10,535 --> 00:20:13,333
Hello, Mr. Rizvi.

292
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:16,467
I'm doing your work.

293
00:20:17,876 --> 00:20:21,073
I think this time there is too much pressure
on you.

294
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,576
We've just opened it.

295
00:20:24,683 --> 00:20:27,049
It's difficult, but it'll be done.

296
00:20:27,986 --> 00:20:29,851
Where in Chennai ar e you going?

297
00:20:30,489 --> 00:20:33,890
For the tyr e. Fine. Fine.

298
00:20:36,495 --> 00:20:39,293
You're embarrassing me.

299
00:20:39,631 --> 00:20:42,725
No. Okay.

300
00:20:42,834 --> 00:20:44,961
Okay, bye. Fine.

301
00:20:45,103 --> 00:20:46,536
What did he say?

302
00:20:46,705 --> 00:20:49,970
He said that I'm his last hope.

303
00:20:50,075 --> 00:20:52,043
Salim, don't take any more work.

304
00:20:52,144 --> 00:20:55,545
Finish it off as soon as possible. Mr. Rizvi is
in a hurry.

305
00:20:55,847 --> 00:20:56,939
Oh, no.

306
00:22:03,648 --> 00:22:05,741
This is the place where today in the
morning..

307
00:22:05,851 --> 00:22:07,682
..the police and the STF made two major
arrests.

308
00:22:07,786 --> 00:22:09,048
Altaf and fahim Ansari.

309
00:22:09,421 --> 00:22:11,582
We've found out that they both have been
living..

310
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:12,714
..in UP for the past three months.

311
00:22:12,824 --> 00:22:16,521
A man called fahim fr om Chandauli district
helped them.

312
00:22:16,695 --> 00:22:19,186
He made arrangements for their food and
lodging.

313
00:22:24,136 --> 00:22:26,798
The police say that a large network of the
sleeper cell..

314
00:22:26,905 --> 00:22:28,463
..is spread all over UP.

315
00:22:28,573 --> 00:22:31,133
It consists of people with no criminal
record.

316
00:22:31,243 --> 00:22:32,710
So the police and the government..

317
00:22:32,811 --> 00:22:37,805
..have initiated new methods of
investigation in UP.

318
00:22:45,957 --> 00:22:47,720
Some minority groups say that under the
pretext..

319
00:22:47,859 --> 00:22:50,054
..of investigating for bombs and
explosives, the police..

320
00:22:50,162 --> 00:22:51,789
..and the government ar e again targeting
their community.

321
00:22:54,866 --> 00:22:58,165
The police say that Abid Khan, a member
of our mosque committee..

322
00:22:58,837 --> 00:23:04,434
..and all the residents of Saray gadimeer
are terrorists.

323
00:23:05,644 --> 00:23:09,080
They suspect that all these people are
partners in this crime..

324
00:23:09,481 --> 00:23:13,178
..and that they help the Jihadis ( rebels)
from Pakistan's Hizb-ul-Mujahideen.

325
00:23:14,553 --> 00:23:18,751
Based on this baseless suspicion they all
wer e arrested.

326
00:23:19,891 --> 00:23:22,485
These arrests have occurred, not just in
Allahabad, but also in..

327
00:23:23,261 --> 00:23:27,027
..Lucknow, Benaras, Kanpur, Faizabad,
Azamgarh

328
00:23:27,666 --> 00:23:31,602
In all, 83 innocent people were arrested.

329
00:23:32,838 --> 00:23:37,002
We just want to know that whenever any
incident occurs..

330
00:23:37,108 --> 00:23:41,909
..anywhere in this country, why does it
directly affect our community?

331
00:23:43,081 --> 00:23:47,142
If the government of this country has
failed to curb terr orists..

332
00:23:47,686 --> 00:23:49,677
..will they vent out their anger on us?

333
00:23:49,855 --> 00:23:51,220
And this way?

334
00:23:51,623 --> 00:23:54,990
By raiding our shops, our homes, our
schools?

335
00:23:55,193 --> 00:23:56,888
What sort of justice is this?

336
00:24:01,299 --> 00:24:03,767
Mr. Tahir Anwar is present among us.

337
00:24:04,903 --> 00:24:06,837
He and his wife were taken..

338
00:24:06,938 --> 00:24:09,873
..for interrogation at 2 o'clock in the mid
night.

339
00:24:12,878 --> 00:24:14,311
All I want to say is that..

340
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:17,848
..if the innocent are harassed like this..

341
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,809
..if atrocities are carried out on innocent
people..

342
00:24:21,987 --> 00:24:23,818
..what would it breed, if not terror?

343
00:24:27,225 --> 00:24:30,991
On behalf of all the members of this
committee..

344
00:24:31,363 --> 00:24:35,823
..and on behalf of Mr. Kasuri, I strongly
condemn this.

345
00:24:43,942 --> 00:24:48,140
It's a shameful thing that our colleagues
are in police custody..

346
00:24:48,413 --> 00:24:50,608
..and ther e's nothing we can do.

347
00:24:51,116 --> 00:24:52,777
But we won't sit quietly.

348
00:24:53,318 --> 00:24:57,846
We've conferred with the r eligious leaders
in Aligarh, Delhi, Mumbai..

349
00:24:58,089 --> 00:25:00,250
..and we've decided the next course of
action.

350
00:25:01,293 --> 00:25:05,093
We'll gather in hordes in the courts..

351
00:25:05,196 --> 00:25:07,357
..of the cities wher e arrests were made.

352
00:25:07,465 --> 00:25:09,695
And we'll raise our voice against them.

353
00:25:13,004 --> 00:25:14,869
Tomorrow, when Abid is presented in the
court..

354
00:25:14,973 --> 00:25:16,668
..we all will be present ther e.

355
00:25:17,008 --> 00:25:20,705
About what task has been allotted to
whom..

356
00:25:20,812 --> 00:25:22,871
..our General Secr etary will brief you.

357
00:25:26,952 --> 00:25:32,049
Islam says that end uring any injustice is
equal to supporting it.

358
00:25:32,724 --> 00:25:35,284
We all will have to r etaliate together.

359
00:25:35,393 --> 00:25:37,884
Hail Allah! - Allah is great!

360
00:25:37,996 --> 00:25:39,987
Hail Allah! - Allah is great!

361
00:25:40,098 --> 00:25:42,293
Hail Allah! - Allah is great!

362
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,300
Innocent. - Release them.

363
00:25:44,402 --> 00:25:46,666
Tyranny. - Won't be tolerated.

364
00:25:46,771 --> 00:25:49,740
UP Police. - Shame on you.

365
00:25:49,841 --> 00:25:51,775
Innocent. - Release them.

366
00:25:51,876 --> 00:25:54,140
Tyranny. - Won't be tolerated.

367
00:25:54,245 --> 00:25:57,373
UP Police. - Shame on you.

368
00:25:57,482 --> 00:25:59,382
Hail Allah! - Allah is great!

369
00:25:59,484 --> 00:26:01,179
Hail Allah! - Allah is great!

370
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:03,344
Taking into consideration the
pr osecution's strong appeal..

371
00:26:03,455 --> 00:26:05,446
..I cancel the pleader's appeal for bail..

372
00:26:05,724 --> 00:26:07,419
..and sentence him to police remand for 1 4
days.

373
00:26:07,993 --> 00:26:09,051
Call next.

374
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,388
Hail Allah! - Allah is great!

375
00:26:10,495 --> 00:26:11,962
Hail Allah! - Allah is great!

376
00:26:12,063 --> 00:26:14,327
Innocent. - Release them.

377
00:26:14,432 --> 00:26:16,491
Tyranny. - Won't be tolerated.

378
00:26:16,768 --> 00:26:19,498
UP Police. - Shame on you.

379
00:26:19,771 --> 00:26:21,966
Innocent. - Release them.

380
00:26:22,073 --> 00:26:24,473
Tyranny. - Won't be tolerated.

381
00:26:24,743 --> 00:26:28,076
Innocent. - Release them.

382
00:26:29,848 --> 00:26:33,113
Won't be tolerated. Won't be tolerated.

383
00:26:33,218 --> 00:26:35,345
Innocent. - Release them.

384
00:26:35,453 --> 00:26:37,182
Won't be tolerated.

385
00:26:37,789 --> 00:26:39,723
Release them.

386
00:26:42,227 --> 00:26:44,718
Tyranny. - Won't be tolerated.

387
00:26:52,837 --> 00:26:54,395
Abid Khan..

388
00:26:54,506 --> 00:26:55,905
Long live..

389
00:26:56,841 --> 00:26:57,899
Come on, Mr. Ali.

390
00:27:46,357 --> 00:27:49,554
You people have businesses. Do your work.

391
00:27:50,095 --> 00:27:51,892
Look, maintain peace and order.

392
00:27:52,197 --> 00:27:55,564
Next time you did this, I'll put you behind
bars.

393
00:27:56,267 --> 00:27:58,064
You may leave now. Release them.

394
00:27:58,403 --> 00:28:01,201
Come on. Please. Move.

395
00:28:01,306 --> 00:28:03,501
Come. - Listen.

396
00:28:04,476 --> 00:28:07,809
One of the people who were char ging with
sticks dropped this.

397
00:28:07,912 --> 00:28:09,402
Return it.

398
00:28:24,429 --> 00:28:30,891
Hashmat, ther e's bad news - Rafat?

399
00:28:33,671 --> 00:28:37,402
Farhan is no more.

400
00:28:43,214 --> 00:28:45,011
Mr. Kasuri's nephew?

401
00:28:48,186 --> 00:28:50,211
Farhan ..who had come from Kanpur for
studies?

402
00:28:50,421 --> 00:28:51,547
Yes.

403
00:29:05,737 --> 00:29:08,865
May God grant heaven to Farhan's soul. -
Amen.

404
00:29:09,207 --> 00:29:13,143
All the members of the committee and all
our fellow Muslims..

405
00:29:13,812 --> 00:29:17,509
..sympathise with Mr. Kasuri and his family.

406
00:29:17,749 --> 00:29:21,981
We pray to God so that he may grant them
the strength to endur e this sorr ow.

407
00:29:22,086 --> 00:29:23,917
Amen.

408
00:29:25,757 --> 00:29:28,453
Obeying commands blind ly is like..

409
00:29:29,794 --> 00:29:32,695
..giving the heartless government the
upper hand.

410
00:29:33,298 --> 00:29:35,664
Staying under the shelter of such a
government..

411
00:29:36,901 --> 00:29:41,600
..and supporting them is like obeying the
orders of Satan.

412
00:29:45,076 --> 00:29:50,013
Any devotee of Islam and Allah will oppose
such a government.

413
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:54,882
This boy's martyr dom won't go in vain.

414
00:29:55,987 --> 00:29:57,887
He gave his life for the community.

415
00:30:00,325 --> 00:30:02,919
The government and the police..

416
00:30:03,261 --> 00:30:05,126
..will have to take the full responsibility.

417
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:07,289
And we want an answer.

418
00:30:10,702 --> 00:30:14,866
I appeal and request you all.

419
00:30:14,973 --> 00:30:19,603
All Muslim br others lend your full support
to me in this task.

420
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:25,672
The heavens won't fall apart if you didn't
go for work for a day.

421
00:30:26,284 --> 00:30:27,512
Over?

422
00:30:27,619 --> 00:30:29,109
You don't have any hair.

423
00:30:29,954 --> 00:30:33,014
Naughty boy. Go and call your father.

424
00:30:33,825 --> 00:30:34,917
Ara.

425
00:30:35,727 --> 00:30:36,955
Are you going?

426
00:30:37,161 --> 00:30:39,994
My br other, Bar quat, used to pray on the
days of Ramzan(Muslim festival).

427
00:30:40,198 --> 00:30:42,632
He never compromised with his work.

428
00:30:42,734 --> 00:30:44,998
I've wasted two days already.

429
00:30:45,203 --> 00:30:48,536
It'll be foolish to stall work for a trivial
matter.

430
00:30:48,773 --> 00:30:51,708
At least visit the physician.

431
00:30:52,777 --> 00:30:54,745
Ready? - Yes, Father.

432
00:30:55,179 --> 00:30:57,545
Start greasing the Ford's engine. - Okay.

433
00:30:57,649 --> 00:30:59,617
I'm going to Dr. Banerjee.

434
00:30:59,717 --> 00:31:00,741
Shall I drop you?

435
00:31:00,852 --> 00:31:03,685
Don't take the trouble. Don't delay your
work.

436
00:31:03,788 --> 00:31:05,619
I'll take an auto.

437
00:31:07,158 --> 00:31:10,093
So you got the chance to meet your friend.

438
00:31:10,295 --> 00:31:12,160
You can't rest in peace without meeting
him.

439
00:31:12,363 --> 00:31:14,331
Won't the physician give you medicine
too?

440
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:17,898
Oh God. Don't remind me of his bitter
medicines.

441
00:31:19,837 --> 00:31:22,328
You've had the pill? There ar e four more
pills.

442
00:31:22,807 --> 00:31:24,274
You have to take it in the morning and in
the evening for two days.

443
00:31:24,375 --> 00:31:25,603
Take it with water.

444
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:27,007
Hello, doctor.

445
00:31:27,312 --> 00:31:30,679
Wait for moment. Come when I call you. -
Okay.

446
00:31:30,915 --> 00:31:33,907
Fine? With water. Not with liquor.

447
00:31:34,218 --> 00:31:35,708
Go.

448
00:31:38,723 --> 00:31:41,817
Sorry. I broke the queue in haste.

449
00:31:41,993 --> 00:31:44,223
No problem, come tomorrow. - Okay.

450
00:31:44,329 --> 00:31:46,297
Oh! Common sit.

451
00:31:46,764 --> 00:31:50,131
Is your BP fine? - Yes, Doctor.

452
00:31:50,335 --> 00:31:51,927
So tell me What brought you here?

453
00:31:53,004 --> 00:31:54,266
What happened?

454
00:31:54,772 --> 00:31:58,731
You hit me where I've hurt myself.

455
00:32:00,745 --> 00:32:02,269
It's swollen.

456
00:32:03,748 --> 00:32:06,273
Looks like the police have taken good care
of you.

457
00:32:06,918 --> 00:32:09,045
Is it hurting? - Of course it is.

458
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,812
It is bound to pain.

459
00:32:11,055 --> 00:32:13,751
I'm not tickling you that you'll laugh.

460
00:32:14,392 --> 00:32:18,624
At this age, if you break your bones, they'll
never heal.

461
00:32:19,964 --> 00:32:21,226
I'm prescribing you medicine.

462
00:32:22,233 --> 00:32:26,135
Apply the ointment and take the pills.

463
00:32:27,171 --> 00:32:31,699
And don't do any heavy work with your
right hand. - Okay.

464
00:32:32,844 --> 00:32:34,038
Okay? - Yes.

465
00:32:34,145 --> 00:32:36,705
No heavy work. - Okay.

466
00:32:38,049 --> 00:32:39,846
I can eat an apple, can't I?

467
00:32:40,418 --> 00:32:42,045
Yes. You can.

468
00:32:42,286 --> 00:32:44,254
But a small one.

469
00:32:46,424 --> 00:32:49,757
Tell me. How is the situation in your
locality?

470
00:32:50,695 --> 00:32:53,892
I've heard there was a ruckus at the police
station.

471
00:32:54,232 --> 00:32:56,826
Yes. But now the situation is under control.

472
00:32:59,137 --> 00:33:02,038
I was sad to hear about Kasuri's nephew.

473
00:33:04,776 --> 00:33:07,904
I felt that there would be mor e riots.

474
00:33:08,012 --> 00:33:10,105
Again a curfew will be put up. Ther e'll be
unrest.

475
00:33:10,848 --> 00:33:12,941
Even I was afraid, Doctor.

476
00:33:13,051 --> 00:33:14,985
Nothing can be predicted.

477
00:33:15,286 --> 00:33:19,347
This afternoon we'll find out what the
Maulana says.

478
00:33:30,234 --> 00:33:34,000
Kasuri spoke to Lucknow's police
commissioner.

479
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:40,240
It shames and hurts me to say that..

480
00:33:41,212 --> 00:33:43,908
..he behaved very rudely.

481
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:49,413
He says that the remand order has been
issued by the court.

482
00:33:50,254 --> 00:33:51,516
We'll have to obey it.

483
00:33:52,523 --> 00:33:54,047
If anyone has died, then the police..

484
00:33:54,158 --> 00:33:56,956
..and the government ar e not responsible
for it.

485
00:33:57,795 --> 00:33:59,387
In fact, we'r e r esponsible for it.

486
00:34:06,003 --> 00:34:10,531
It clearly shows that he is not taking us
seriously.

487
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:14,469
Maybe he is not awar e of our strength.

488
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:18,476
He doesn't know that for one death..

489
00:34:18,583 --> 00:34:20,517
Now nobody will discuss anything.

490
00:34:21,385 --> 00:34:25,321
Seven of our people are in the remand for
1 4 days.

491
00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:27,380
Until they ar e not released and until..

492
00:34:27,492 --> 00:34:30,928
..the government doesn't take the
responsibility of my nephew's death..

493
00:34:31,129 --> 00:34:35,259
..all the markets which come under the
mosque will remain shut.

494
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,091
No shop will be open.

495
00:34:38,603 --> 00:34:42,266
I appeal to all Muslim brothers..

496
00:34:42,373 --> 00:34:44,500
..who work in government offices.

497
00:34:44,976 --> 00:34:51,176
Be it teachers, officers, d rivers, doctors,
engineers or peons.

498
00:34:51,382 --> 00:34:52,906
Don't go to work.

499
00:34:53,384 --> 00:34:57,047
We have to show them what our position
in this country is.

500
00:34:57,388 --> 00:35:00,516
We've chosen what we had to choose after
independence.

501
00:35:00,925 --> 00:35:03,416
God knows when this country will choose
us.

502
00:35:04,262 --> 00:35:06,093
If they still didn't heed us..

503
00:35:06,197 --> 00:35:09,325
..then we won't be responsible for
whatever happens.

504
00:35:10,168 --> 00:35:13,228
Kasuri Sahab, we all ar e with you.

505
00:35:13,404 --> 00:35:15,372
And God is with us.

506
00:35:15,473 --> 00:35:18,340
Hail God! - God is great!

507
00:35:18,442 --> 00:35:22,173
Hail God! - God is great!

508
00:35:33,457 --> 00:35:34,515
Inayat.

509
00:35:35,126 --> 00:35:36,354
Yes.

510
00:35:37,929 --> 00:35:40,397
I wanted to talk to Kasuri.

511
00:35:40,731 --> 00:35:44,360
Great. Where did the sun rise from today?

512
00:35:44,735 --> 00:35:47,966
I've been craving to see the sight of you
both talking.

513
00:35:48,072 --> 00:35:50,870
Come. Why delay a good deed?

514
00:35:52,877 --> 00:35:54,970
Maulana. - Yes.

515
00:35:55,513 --> 00:35:58,778
Make arrangements to deliver the decr ee
to the people as soon as possible.

516
00:35:58,883 --> 00:35:59,907
As you wish, sir.

517
00:36:00,017 --> 00:36:04,351
I gave my word for a government task.

518
00:36:04,655 --> 00:36:06,714
In reference to that, I wanted to talk to you
people.

519
00:36:07,024 --> 00:36:08,651
What? - Inayat.

520
00:36:09,527 --> 00:36:11,461
Meet the shopkeepers personally.

521
00:36:11,762 --> 00:36:13,093
If one market is kept shut..

522
00:36:13,364 --> 00:36:16,731
..then Muslims of other markets too will
come forward to support us.

523
00:36:17,635 --> 00:36:19,967
Okay.

524
00:36:22,773 --> 00:36:24,331
Do you have any problem?

525
00:36:27,011 --> 00:36:29,946
No. It's okay.

526
00:36:52,937 --> 00:36:56,998
Nothing will happen. It's just a matter of a
few days.

527
00:36:57,475 --> 00:37:00,933
Kasuri's anger will subside. Shops will
reopen.

528
00:37:01,545 --> 00:37:04,844
Oh, God. No work for fourteen days?

529
00:37:05,182 --> 00:37:08,709
How will poor workers feed themselves?

530
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:11,580
It's good that only the shops have been
shut down.

531
00:37:11,689 --> 00:37:12,713
Otherwise they would have resorted to
vandalism.

532
00:37:12,823 --> 00:37:15,417
Vandalism would have been the right
thing to do.

533
00:37:15,693 --> 00:37:17,160
Unnecessarily the police harasses us.

534
00:37:17,461 --> 00:37:20,624
Once we retaliate, they'll learn a lesson.

535
00:37:21,499 --> 00:37:23,990
I've heard they are thrashing our men
badly in the remand.

536
00:37:24,635 --> 00:37:26,125
You people are not doing anything?

537
00:37:26,237 --> 00:37:28,603
Of course, we are.

538
00:37:28,706 --> 00:37:30,401
That's why we've shut down the market.

539
00:37:30,508 --> 00:37:33,477
Will people working in private companies
go for work?

540
00:37:34,445 --> 00:37:36,140
Who can stop those who want to go?

541
00:37:36,447 --> 00:37:38,142
And how many people would they keep a
tab on?

542
00:37:38,516 --> 00:37:39,949
How is that possible?

543
00:37:40,117 --> 00:37:42,642
It's a decree. It's applicable to everybody.

544
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,581
Just watch. Nobody will go for work.

545
00:37:44,689 --> 00:37:45,883
What do you say, brother?

546
00:38:03,274 --> 00:38:04,901
Hello. - Hello.

547
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:07,610
I am Anant Zanani from NDTV India.

548
00:38:07,712 --> 00:38:09,839
I had called you up. - Yes. Sit.

549
00:38:10,214 --> 00:38:11,943
I didn't understand on the phone.

550
00:38:12,049 --> 00:38:14,017
You were saying something about an
interview.

551
00:38:14,185 --> 00:38:17,848
Actually, we'r e doing a story on the
museum car.

552
00:38:18,222 --> 00:38:21,020
You know Mr. Belwari, don't you? From the
transport department?

553
00:38:21,125 --> 00:38:22,149
Very well.

554
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:26,596
He told me that you'r e repairing the
engine of that car.

555
00:38:26,931 --> 00:38:28,660
I found out that you stay in the vicinity.

556
00:38:28,766 --> 00:38:31,064
So I thought I'd interview you.

557
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:33,602
Why do you want to interview me?

558
00:38:33,804 --> 00:38:35,897
I'm an ill-r eputed man.

559
00:38:36,006 --> 00:38:37,530
Shall we begin?

560
00:38:40,578 --> 00:38:42,011
What do I have to do?

561
00:38:42,146 --> 00:38:45,946
Look into the camera and answer my
questions. That's all.

562
00:38:47,952 --> 00:38:50,250
Manavendra, go.

563
00:38:50,654 --> 00:38:53,122
A 60-year-old historic Ford car.

564
00:38:53,224 --> 00:38:55,692
A car whose engine has got damaged.

565
00:38:55,826 --> 00:38:59,853
A historic car on which a great soul's ashes
were kept..

566
00:38:59,964 --> 00:39:01,295
..and it was taken to Sangam.

567
00:39:01,565 --> 00:39:04,830
A capable mechanic has been handed the
responsibility of repairing it.

568
00:39:04,935 --> 00:39:06,664
Let's meet him.

569
00:39:06,937 --> 00:39:09,929
Mr. Hashmatullah, you're repairing the
engine of..

570
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,031
..the car which is a memorial to Gandhi.
How do you feel?

571
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,943
Which car are you talking about?

572
00:39:18,249 --> 00:39:21,514
The museum car whose engine you are
repairing.

573
00:39:21,685 --> 00:39:23,744
Yes.

574
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:30,593
Pardon me. I'm repairing the engine.

575
00:39:30,795 --> 00:39:33,764
But I have no idea what you're talking
about.

576
00:39:33,998 --> 00:39:37,729
For d V8 American car's engine.. - I know.

577
00:39:37,868 --> 00:39:42,100
But I don't know whether it has any
connection to Gandhiji.

578
00:39:42,273 --> 00:39:44,537
You don't know?

579
00:39:44,642 --> 00:39:46,109
It's not surprising.

580
00:39:47,011 --> 00:39:49,775
I get many damaged engines from the
transport department.

581
00:39:49,914 --> 00:39:51,279
I repair the engine.

582
00:39:51,382 --> 00:39:54,715
I don't have anything to do with the car it
came from.

583
00:39:54,852 --> 00:39:58,720
I never asked and he never told me. This
engine..

584
00:39:58,823 --> 00:40:02,281
You don't know why you are repairing this
car's engine.

585
00:40:02,393 --> 00:40:04,122
No.

586
00:40:04,728 --> 00:40:08,562
That's strange. You'll watch it on NDTV
India anyways.

587
00:40:08,666 --> 00:40:13,228
Since you're linked to it, I'd like to tell you.

588
00:40:13,704 --> 00:40:16,366
At the time of India and Pakistan's
division..

589
00:40:16,707 --> 00:40:21,735
..there were rumours that Mahatma
Gandhi is supporting Muslims..

590
00:40:21,846 --> 00:40:24,076
..and he is bowing down to them.

591
00:40:24,248 --> 00:40:26,045
He is giving them Rs.5 5 cr or e.

592
00:40:26,317 --> 00:40:28,785
That's why he was murder ed.

593
00:40:29,753 --> 00:40:31,584
His last wish was..

594
00:40:31,689 --> 00:40:34,783
..that his ashes should be immersed in all
the Indian rivers.

595
00:40:34,959 --> 00:40:38,952
That's why after his cr emation his ashes
were put in 20 separate urns..

596
00:40:39,063 --> 00:40:40,894
..and they were sent to every corner of this
country.

597
00:40:41,065 --> 00:40:43,659
One urn was brought to Allahabad.

598
00:40:43,868 --> 00:40:47,167
It was kept in the car whose engine you
are repairing..

599
00:40:47,271 --> 00:40:50,672
..and it was immersed at Sangam.

600
00:40:51,242 --> 00:40:56,009
At the same time one urn was sent to
Orrisa's capital Cuttack.

601
00:40:56,213 --> 00:40:58,340
It was kept in a bank's locker.

602
00:40:58,883 --> 00:41:00,248
Then God knows what happened.

603
00:41:00,351 --> 00:41:03,013
Maybe people forgot all about it.

604
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,712
The reason is unknown.

605
00:41:04,822 --> 00:41:08,155
For so many years the urn remained in the
locker.

606
00:41:08,425 --> 00:41:10,256
What ar e you saying?

607
00:41:15,733 --> 00:41:19,225
We keep the ashes of such a great man
and then we forget all about it.

608
00:41:19,336 --> 00:41:20,394
Great.

609
00:41:20,671 --> 00:41:24,937
Now his great-grandson,Tushar Gandhi,
has collected the urn from there.

610
00:41:25,209 --> 00:41:27,769
And the amazing thing is that he had to
submit an application..

611
00:41:27,878 --> 00:41:30,244
..to the Orrisa High Court.

612
00:41:30,347 --> 00:41:33,145
Saying, ''This is my belonging. Give it back
to me.''

613
00:41:33,684 --> 00:41:35,914
Now he has got this urn back.

614
00:41:38,055 --> 00:41:40,785
His wish is to carry out everything..

615
00:41:40,891 --> 00:41:42,916
..the way it was performed in 1 948.

616
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,957
The Government has agreed to it.

617
00:41:46,163 --> 00:41:49,997
The urn will be kept in the circuit house for
a few days for public view.

618
00:41:50,267 --> 00:41:53,930
He wants it to be taken to Sangam in the
car..

619
00:41:54,104 --> 00:41:55,765
..which you ar e r epairing.

620
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:57,805
And then to be immersed there.

621
00:42:00,344 --> 00:42:04,110
Now I understand why they were in a
hurry.

622
00:42:05,249 --> 00:42:07,274
What you're doing is no less a gr eat deed
either.

623
00:42:07,451 --> 00:42:09,282
Let's shoot it.

624
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,249
Okay.

625
00:42:13,991 --> 00:42:15,686
When is Tushar Gandhi coming to
Allahabad?

626
00:42:27,071 --> 00:42:29,096
Mahatma Gandhi. - Is immortal.

627
00:42:29,206 --> 00:42:31,140
Mahatma Gandhi. - Is immortal.

628
00:42:31,241 --> 00:42:32,868
Mahatma Gandhi. - Is immortal.

629
00:42:32,977 --> 00:42:34,740
Mahatma Gandhi. - Is immortal.

630
00:42:34,845 --> 00:42:36,710
Mahatma Gandhi. - Is immortal.

631
00:42:36,814 --> 00:42:38,338
Mahatma Gandhi. - Is immortal.

632
00:42:38,449 --> 00:42:40,007
Mahatma Gandhi. - Is immortal.

633
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:45,286
How can one commit such a grave
mistake?

634
00:42:45,456 --> 00:42:47,014
Was everybody asleep?

635
00:42:48,392 --> 00:42:50,087
I'm shocked to hear about it.

636
00:42:51,862 --> 00:42:53,386
Did you call Rizvi?

637
00:42:54,064 --> 00:42:56,328
He said he received orders from his
superiors..

638
00:42:56,567 --> 00:42:58,364
..not to tell anybody.

639
00:42:59,803 --> 00:43:01,828
Is he aware that the shops are closed?

640
00:43:02,039 --> 00:43:05,406
Yes. But I told him that his work is going
on.

641
00:43:06,577 --> 00:43:09,011
Tell me. What should I do?

642
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:14,744
It's such a big r esponsibility. My mind has
stopped working.

643
00:43:16,553 --> 00:43:18,544
Look, if you have to finish the work soon..

644
00:43:19,023 --> 00:43:20,217
..then do it at home.

645
00:43:20,924 --> 00:43:23,415
The decr ee was to stop all your work.

646
00:43:23,927 --> 00:43:26,418
..not to take your work home.

647
00:43:27,231 --> 00:43:29,529
I'm the general secretary.

648
00:43:29,867 --> 00:43:33,234
If people found out, then a decree will be
issued against me.

649
00:43:34,071 --> 00:43:35,800
I'm r eally scar ed.

650
00:43:36,173 --> 00:43:38,300
Do it furtively. So that nobody finds out.

651
00:43:38,509 --> 00:43:45,073
I'll have to take the lathe machine and the
generator home.

652
00:43:46,216 --> 00:43:48,013
Give the work to some other mechanic.

653
00:43:48,318 --> 00:43:49,478
There is Mohafdarganz.

654
00:43:49,853 --> 00:43:52,151
There must be some mechanic in gaala
Bazaar.

655
00:43:53,023 --> 00:43:54,854
Or else Lucknow.

656
00:43:55,859 --> 00:43:58,089
It's a very old engine.

657
00:43:58,429 --> 00:44:01,193
I'm the only one in the entire Allahabad
who can repair it.

658
00:44:01,298 --> 00:44:02,856
That's why I was assigned the job.

659
00:44:02,966 --> 00:44:05,161
There's no time to take it anywhere else.

660
00:44:07,871 --> 00:44:10,431
See now there are only two options.

661
00:44:10,908 --> 00:44:13,502
Either ask the committee for a permission
to let you work..

662
00:44:14,611 --> 00:44:17,409
..or r eturn the engine.

663
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:21,413
Refusing honestly is much better than..

664
00:44:21,652 --> 00:44:24,143
..agreeing just to please somebody.

665
00:44:27,591 --> 00:44:28,649
Okay.

666
00:44:30,227 --> 00:44:34,220
I don't feel like doing it, but I'll return it.

667
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:37,590
I'll say that I couldn't repair it.

668
00:44:38,068 --> 00:44:40,866
If I return it today, the worst that'll happen
is that I'll be defamed.

669
00:44:41,171 --> 00:44:44,663
If I didn't return it on time, then it would
be very humiliating.

670
00:44:52,649 --> 00:44:54,116
You just ask the committee members and
see.

671
00:44:54,218 --> 00:44:55,776
It is no use asking now.

672
00:44:55,886 --> 00:44:57,148
See, it's not an or dinary thing.

673
00:44:57,788 --> 00:44:59,153
They might give you permission.

674
00:44:59,656 --> 00:45:01,647
I want to meet Mr. Belwariar.

675
00:45:03,093 --> 00:45:07,655
Yes. He went out with Mr. Sharma and Mr.
Verma a few minutes ago.

676
00:45:07,765 --> 00:45:08,789
When will they return?

677
00:45:08,899 --> 00:45:10,696
I can't tell you that.

678
00:45:11,301 --> 00:45:13,735
Nowadays some important work is going
on.

679
00:45:14,138 --> 00:45:17,232
So they keep coming and going.

680
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:21,501
What should we do now? Should we call
them?

681
00:45:21,879 --> 00:45:24,677
I think we'd better talk personally.

682
00:45:30,187 --> 00:45:31,779
Do you have any idea what time they'd
return?

683
00:45:32,689 --> 00:45:35,487
Why are you so worried? They'll come.

684
00:45:35,859 --> 00:45:38,919
Till then, do one thing. Go and take a look
at the museum.

685
00:45:39,663 --> 00:45:42,860
Look, we've opened a new gallery on
Gand hiji over there.

686
00:45:43,033 --> 00:45:44,091
Go and take a look.

687
00:45:44,268 --> 00:45:48,568
There are no tickets on it. It's for fr ee. Go
and take a look.

688
00:45:49,273 --> 00:45:51,537
When sir comes, I'll tell him you'r e here.

689
00:45:51,809 --> 00:45:53,868
Go. Go and take a look. Go.

690
00:45:54,111 --> 00:45:55,578
Thank you.

691
00:48:08,845 --> 00:48:13,009
Listen. Mahatma Gandhi's car that's being
repaired..

692
00:48:13,483 --> 00:48:14,916
Do you wish to see it?

693
00:48:15,118 --> 00:48:18,383
Come with me. I'll show you. Come.

694
00:48:32,769 --> 00:48:34,794
Come. See this.

695
00:48:35,072 --> 00:48:36,403
Isn't it beautiful?

696
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:39,472
It's all the result of the har d work of our
division.

697
00:48:40,344 --> 00:48:44,144
Do you know? Six new tyres are coming
from Chennai.

698
00:48:44,481 --> 00:48:46,005
When will this car get ready?

699
00:48:46,216 --> 00:48:48,377
In just four to five days.

700
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:52,213
But the main work is done by a man fr om
our community.

701
00:48:52,489 --> 00:48:54,013
Hashmatullah Mistry.

702
00:48:54,124 --> 00:48:55,751
He's from Allahabad.

703
00:48:55,892 --> 00:48:57,291
He's the one making the engine.

704
00:48:57,461 --> 00:49:00,862
The moment the engine is done we'll be
r eady to go.

705
00:49:05,769 --> 00:49:07,430
Won't you meet him?

706
00:49:07,738 --> 00:49:09,205
Let it be. We will call him.

707
00:49:27,591 --> 00:49:31,118
Just two days of the strike, and the entir e
city is berserk.

708
00:49:32,529 --> 00:49:34,520
Mr. Kasuri and I are getting calls..

709
00:49:34,631 --> 00:49:36,690
..from all over the country to encourage us.

710
00:49:37,901 --> 00:49:40,699
And the committee members from all the
mosques here say..

711
00:49:41,238 --> 00:49:43,706
..that if in two days our demands ar e not
fulfilled..

712
00:49:44,241 --> 00:49:46,709
..then all of them will also shut down their
shops.

713
00:49:48,278 --> 00:49:51,509
We will also help them financially.

714
00:49:53,683 --> 00:49:59,019
And in the meantime, if any of our fellow
Muslims is in need of money..

715
00:49:59,523 --> 00:50:01,718
..then without any hesitation he can meet
Mr. Gaffar.

716
00:50:03,693 --> 00:50:05,217
Stand up.

717
00:50:11,701 --> 00:50:13,669
Come, come, Mr. Hashmat.

718
00:50:15,305 --> 00:50:17,637
We all wer e missing you. - Greetings.

719
00:50:17,774 --> 00:50:21,266
People like you are needed to keep our
community together.

720
00:50:21,545 --> 00:50:24,946
By God's grace, you set an example to all
the Muslim brothers.

721
00:50:25,849 --> 00:50:28,181
I'd like to tell all of you..

722
00:50:28,885 --> 00:50:31,911
..that our Mr. Hashmat has taken up a gr eat
task of the government museum..

723
00:50:32,022 --> 00:50:34,684
..that is connected with Gand hiji.

724
00:50:34,991 --> 00:50:37,789
And as soon as the order was given that no
one would work..

725
00:50:37,894 --> 00:50:40,294
..our Mr. Hashmat immediately
implemented it..

726
00:50:40,564 --> 00:50:41,622
..and he immediately stopped the work.

727
00:50:41,731 --> 00:50:42,857
Great.

728
00:50:44,835 --> 00:50:48,168
Maulana, I wish to speak to you all.

729
00:50:48,271 --> 00:50:51,069
Yes, yes, definitely. Tell.

730
00:50:51,241 --> 00:50:52,799
Tell them what you wish to say.

731
00:50:54,111 --> 00:50:56,602
Initially I was quite scared to come her e.

732
00:50:56,746 --> 00:50:59,738
But after coming here, amongst our own
people..

733
00:50:59,850 --> 00:51:01,841
..I feel very secur e.

734
00:51:02,652 --> 00:51:07,055
Maulana, Mr. Kasuri, I have come to
request you..

735
00:51:07,157 --> 00:51:10,524
..to please give me permission to open my
shop and start my work.

736
00:51:18,568 --> 00:51:19,660
What ar e you saying?

737
00:51:19,903 --> 00:51:24,704
Yes, I feel that I should keep my word of
completing the task.

738
00:51:25,575 --> 00:51:31,138
I'd like to do all of this with your consent.

739
00:51:33,016 --> 00:51:36,076
If you wish, then I can keep my shop
closed and work inside.

740
00:51:36,186 --> 00:51:38,654
It would be very kind of you to allow me to
work.

741
00:51:39,222 --> 00:51:41,247
Mr. Hashmat, do you know what you'r e
saying?

742
00:51:41,791 --> 00:51:44,157
You're seeking permission from the one
whose house you want to destroy.

743
00:51:44,261 --> 00:51:45,660
No, no, that is not the case.

744
00:51:45,762 --> 00:51:47,320
You are the committee's general secretary.

745
00:51:47,597 --> 00:51:49,121
You should be aware of your
responsibilities.

746
00:51:49,232 --> 00:51:52,258
Yes, I am. That's why I am asking for your
permission.

747
00:51:52,669 --> 00:51:54,796
If you say so, I'll take the engine home.

748
00:51:54,938 --> 00:51:56,200
I'll sit at home and do my work.

749
00:51:56,306 --> 00:51:57,568
Then the betel nut vendor will go door to
door..

750
00:51:57,674 --> 00:51:58,698
..to sell his betel nuts and leaves.

751
00:51:58,808 --> 00:52:00,867
The barber will go door to door to do his
work.

752
00:52:01,111 --> 00:52:03,375
What's the need of closing down the
shops?

753
00:52:04,748 --> 00:52:07,649
All of them can open the back doors to
their shops.

754
00:52:08,652 --> 00:52:10,176
For give me, Mr. Kasuri.

755
00:52:10,387 --> 00:52:13,823
That day I wanted to talk to you about
this..

756
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:15,990
..but there was mourning everywhere so..

757
00:52:16,092 --> 00:52:19,084
It's not your fault. Treachery runs in your
family.

758
00:52:20,163 --> 00:52:22,927
Your brother too had betrayed us.

759
00:52:23,333 --> 00:52:26,825
It'd be better to keep our personal issues
away from community matters.

760
00:52:26,937 --> 00:52:28,734
You don't talk about the community.

761
00:52:28,838 --> 00:52:30,738
If you were worried about the community..

762
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:32,774
..you wouldn't be saying such indecent
things.

763
00:52:33,343 --> 00:52:35,811
With these intentions you dr eam of
becoming the chairman?

764
00:52:35,912 --> 00:52:38,312
I'm not at all interested in becoming the
chairman. No.

765
00:52:38,648 --> 00:52:41,242
Mr. Hashmat, fear God.

766
00:52:41,952 --> 00:52:43,852
You are a true Muslim.

767
00:52:44,154 --> 00:52:46,281
If you go against the community and open
your shop..

768
00:52:46,389 --> 00:52:49,187
..then your r eligion and your God will
never for give you.

769
00:52:50,694 --> 00:52:52,787
As it is you who have already committed a
crime..

770
00:52:52,929 --> 00:52:54,419
..by getting featured on television.

771
00:52:54,931 --> 00:52:57,923
Maulana, this is my personal matter.

772
00:52:58,068 --> 00:52:59,797
Where does religion come in here?

773
00:53:00,003 --> 00:53:04,030
By the way, my work is also my religion.

774
00:53:04,474 --> 00:53:06,203
And it tells me that if you've given a word
to someone..

775
00:53:06,309 --> 00:53:07,742
..you must keep it.

776
00:53:07,978 --> 00:53:09,809
Mr. Hashmat, please sit.

777
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:12,073
We will sit and talk it over.

778
00:53:12,182 --> 00:53:14,047
What will you say to him?

779
00:53:14,718 --> 00:53:16,686
Is he going to understand?

780
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:19,217
Has anyone gone to prison from his
house?

781
00:53:19,689 --> 00:53:21,657
Has a young boy died in his family?

782
00:53:22,259 --> 00:53:24,454
Why would he be concerned for his
community?

783
00:53:24,861 --> 00:53:27,022
He is only worried about his name and
status.

784
00:53:27,130 --> 00:53:30,293
He wishes to be famous. He wants to come
on television.

785
00:53:30,867 --> 00:53:32,994
I'll speak to him. Please Kasuri sahab

786
00:53:33,236 --> 00:53:36,262
Mr. Hashmat, why are you being so
obstinate?

787
00:53:36,740 --> 00:53:38,674
In two to four days the shops will open up.

788
00:53:39,209 --> 00:53:40,870
You can do your work then.

789
00:53:41,177 --> 00:53:43,077
At least you don't say this.

790
00:53:43,713 --> 00:53:45,681
Why are we fighting amongst ourselves?

791
00:53:46,249 --> 00:53:47,716
What is this, Mr. Hashmat?

792
00:53:47,884 --> 00:53:51,081
Why are you making a mountain out of a
molehill?

793
00:53:51,554 --> 00:53:54,955
If you do not do this work someone else
will do it.

794
00:53:55,158 --> 00:53:58,093
Have all the mechanics of Allahabad
perished?

795
00:53:58,528 --> 00:53:59,995
Why shouldn't I do it?

796
00:54:00,096 --> 00:54:02,690
Just a minute. Something is wrong.

797
00:54:02,832 --> 00:54:04,766
Look here, these people are not stopping
you..

798
00:54:04,868 --> 00:54:07,029
..because you are making Gandhiji's car.

799
00:54:07,604 --> 00:54:09,834
If that's what you think, then you are
wrong.

800
00:54:09,939 --> 00:54:12,703
Look here, it may be anyone's work.

801
00:54:12,909 --> 00:54:14,934
But once the order comes from the
mosque..

802
00:54:15,111 --> 00:54:16,613
..then you must accept that as the order
from Allah..

803
00:54:16,613 --> 00:54:16,908
..then you must accept that as the order
from Allah..

804
00:54:17,013 --> 00:54:18,037
..and follow it.

805
00:54:18,148 --> 00:54:19,172
Definitely.

806
00:54:19,349 --> 00:54:23,979
Maulana, that man laid his life down for us.

807
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:27,917
His own people killed him because he was
favouring us.

808
00:54:29,693 --> 00:54:31,718
And today, if I'm doing something for him..

809
00:54:31,828 --> 00:54:33,056
..what's wr ong with it?

810
00:54:34,564 --> 00:54:35,098
Gaffar.

811
00:54:35,098 --> 00:54:35,655
Gaffar.

812
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:42,264
Inayat, Zulfi? Sallau?

813
00:54:43,139 --> 00:54:44,834
Why are you all quiet? Say something at
least.

814
00:54:44,974 --> 00:54:48,740
What will they say? They know what you
are saying is unfair.

815
00:54:49,145 --> 00:54:51,670
No. They are scared of you.

816
00:54:51,948 --> 00:54:53,540
But you're not scared?

817
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:55,684
I'm not scared of doing the right thing.

818
00:54:55,885 --> 00:54:57,580
Then why ar e you arguing?

819
00:54:57,854 --> 00:54:59,253
You've come here not to take permission..

820
00:54:59,356 --> 00:55:01,221
..but to announce your decision.

821
00:55:04,761 --> 00:55:06,592
Okay, do as you wish.

822
00:55:06,796 --> 00:55:08,627
We will do what we want to do.

823
00:55:13,103 --> 00:55:14,627
Good bye.

824
00:55:29,219 --> 00:55:30,954
Long live Gandhiji.

825
00:55:30,954 --> 00:55:33,081
Long live Gandhiji.

826
00:55:50,874 --> 00:55:52,364
How long have you been pulling this
rickshaw?

827
00:55:52,709 --> 00:55:54,870
Since the past 1 0 to 1 5 years.

828
00:55:55,812 --> 00:55:58,838
Now, if your Muslim brothers ask to stop
the rickshaws..

829
00:55:59,115 --> 00:56:00,173
..what will you do then?

830
00:56:00,283 --> 00:56:01,716
Will you ask me to get down her e in the
middle of the road?

831
00:56:01,818 --> 00:56:04,286
No sir, how can I d rop you here?

832
00:56:05,021 --> 00:56:07,717
Won't you listen to your community? Will
you r ebel against them?

833
00:56:07,824 --> 00:56:07,891
This is not about rebellion, sir.

834
00:56:07,891 --> 00:56:09,882
This is not about rebellion, sir.

835
00:56:09,993 --> 00:56:11,824
This rickshaw is my livelihood.

836
00:56:11,928 --> 00:56:13,828
And you're my customer.

837
00:56:13,930 --> 00:56:15,659
How does it concern the community?

838
00:56:15,765 --> 00:56:18,666
They won't provide me my bread and
butter.

839
00:56:18,768 --> 00:56:20,065
What if they pressurise you?

840
00:56:20,170 --> 00:56:22,365
How can they force me?

841
00:56:22,705 --> 00:56:26,197
This is India and not Pakistan or the
Taliban.

842
00:56:45,228 --> 00:56:46,786
Your blood pr essure has increased.

843
00:56:47,931 --> 00:56:49,831
Please don't tell Ara about this.

844
00:56:51,301 --> 00:56:52,393
Br other.

845
00:56:54,137 --> 00:56:55,468
What kind of stupidity is this?

846
00:56:56,806 --> 00:56:58,899
Why did you go and create commotion
there?

847
00:56:59,776 --> 00:57:01,175
Do you know what those people are
saying?

848
00:57:01,811 --> 00:57:03,413
Calm down, he's not well. Talk later.

849
00:57:03,413 --> 00:57:05,244
Calm down, he's not well. Talk later.

850
00:57:06,516 --> 00:57:08,848
He is responsible to ruin his own health.

851
00:57:11,221 --> 00:57:14,156
Just see how they will make our life
miserable in the market.

852
00:57:14,724 --> 00:57:17,056
You go. Go.

853
00:57:17,927 --> 00:57:18,951
Go.

854
00:57:20,029 --> 00:57:22,098
Now I can't even say anything.

855
00:57:22,098 --> 00:57:22,757
Now I can't even say anything.

856
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:29,428
Doctor, did you see? I just said that I'll open
my shop..

857
00:57:30,173 --> 00:57:32,698
..and all of them went against me.

858
00:57:33,109 --> 00:57:36,044
All those who wer e with me for so many
years.

859
00:57:36,145 --> 00:57:37,339
All of them.

860
00:57:37,947 --> 00:57:39,505
Even my own br other.

861
00:57:39,782 --> 00:57:40,383
Hashmat, just forget it.

862
00:57:40,383 --> 00:57:41,111
Hashmat, just forget it.

863
00:57:41,784 --> 00:57:43,411
Take rest.

864
00:57:48,358 --> 00:57:52,988
Hashmat, you can wake up those who are
sleeping.

865
00:57:53,863 --> 00:57:58,129
But it's useless to try waking the ones who
feign sleep.

866
00:57:58,868 --> 00:57:59,202
Don't regr et it. I'm going.

867
00:57:59,202 --> 00:58:01,500
Don't regr et it. I'm going.

868
00:58:35,238 --> 00:58:36,239
Listen, where are you?

869
00:58:36,239 --> 00:58:38,070
Listen, where are you?

870
00:59:27,357 --> 00:59:28,483
What happened?

871
00:59:30,159 --> 00:59:31,728
Are you okay?

872
00:59:34,230 --> 00:59:35,959
Why have you come here?

873
00:59:38,201 --> 00:59:39,896
You're crying?

874
00:59:40,903 --> 00:59:42,234
What's the matter?

875
00:59:42,605 --> 00:59:44,232
Tell me.

876
00:59:45,108 --> 00:59:46,575
I just don't understand.

877
00:59:47,377 --> 00:59:50,079
When I listened to them and I closed my
shop and sat at home..

878
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:51,011
When I listened to them and I closed my
shop and sat at home..

879
00:59:51,314 --> 00:59:53,043
..I was a true Muslim.

880
00:59:53,650 --> 00:59:55,880
The moment I told them my intentions..

881
00:59:56,085 --> 00:59:58,212
..I immediately became a traitor.

882
01:00:00,623 --> 01:00:06,118
God knows what's wrong with us. We
associate everything with r eligion.

883
01:00:09,298 --> 01:00:11,960
Why do you take this to heart?

884
01:00:12,535 --> 01:00:14,503
This is a useless fight.

885
01:00:15,171 --> 01:00:19,403
Will we starve if you don't finish this
government task?

886
01:00:20,443 --> 01:00:22,673
Do it when the shops open.

887
01:00:23,446 --> 01:00:25,038
They ar e our people.

888
01:00:25,448 --> 01:00:27,183
Where will we go by fig hting and going
against their wishes.

889
01:00:27,183 --> 01:00:28,445
Where will we go by fig hting and going
against their wishes.

890
01:00:28,551 --> 01:00:30,212
This is the problem.

891
01:00:30,586 --> 01:00:32,577
You too ar e talking like them.

892
01:00:33,690 --> 01:00:35,282
Am I not a Muslim?

893
01:00:36,059 --> 01:00:37,583
Do I not respect Islam?

894
01:00:38,561 --> 01:00:40,085
Even I pray five times a day.

895
01:00:40,196 --> 01:00:41,993
I've read the Quraan Sharif Holy book of
Islam).

896
01:00:43,199 --> 01:00:45,702
I know that helping the poor is worship.

897
01:00:45,702 --> 01:00:46,100
I know that helping the poor is worship.

898
01:00:46,202 --> 01:00:47,692
To give water to the thirsty is worship.

899
01:00:47,970 --> 01:00:50,063
The same way my livelihood is also
worship.

900
01:00:50,306 --> 01:00:52,035
These are God's own words.

901
01:00:55,078 --> 01:00:58,013
The Islam that I know of tells me that you
should be loyal..

902
01:00:58,214 --> 01:01:02,708
..to the country where you stay and where
you earn your br ead and butter.

903
01:01:03,986 --> 01:01:04,087
And their religion compels them to stop
me fr om working..

904
01:01:04,087 --> 01:01:08,217
And their religion compels them to stop
me fr om working..

905
01:01:08,691 --> 01:01:10,659
..the reason because I don't listen to them.

906
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:13,351
Then go and explain it to them.

907
01:01:13,463 --> 01:01:15,431
What do I do to explain them?

908
01:01:16,432 --> 01:01:22,200
If only they realised that the person whose
job I'm doing..

909
01:01:22,305 --> 01:01:23,039
..is their kin as well.

910
01:01:23,039 --> 01:01:24,165
..is their kin as well.

911
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:27,168
He was from this country where we reside.

912
01:01:27,410 --> 01:01:29,970
But these people obstruct my work under
the name of r eligion.

913
01:01:32,749 --> 01:01:35,980
More than this, I am hurt..

914
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:40,255
..because not a single friend of mine is
backing me.

915
01:01:41,991 --> 01:01:44,221
They didn't even call me once.

916
01:01:52,135 --> 01:01:55,571
Today, I saw the photo of Gandhiji's final
moments.

917
01:01:56,639 --> 01:01:58,106
I tell you..

918
01:01:59,041 --> 01:02:00,076
..as if he has not attained peace even after
his death.

919
01:02:00,076 --> 01:02:02,169
..as if he has not attained peace even after
his death.

920
01:02:03,246 --> 01:02:05,680
That was clearly showing on his face.

921
01:02:09,218 --> 01:02:10,651
Look here..

922
01:02:11,621 --> 01:02:13,748
I do not know too much..

923
01:02:14,390 --> 01:02:17,791
..but I know this much that you will never
harm anyone.

924
01:02:19,128 --> 01:02:23,030
If you feel what you're doing is right, go
ahead.

925
01:02:23,699 --> 01:02:25,428
God is with you.

926
01:02:40,783 --> 01:02:42,478
Mr. Hashmat.

927
01:02:42,585 --> 01:02:47,420
Hasmat, what are you doing? - Why are
you being so obstinate?

928
01:02:47,690 --> 01:02:48,816
Don't open the shop.

929
01:02:49,325 --> 01:02:50,417
It's not right.

930
01:02:50,793 --> 01:02:52,454
You are the general secr etary of the
committee.

931
01:02:52,829 --> 01:02:55,398
If you open the shop, it'll be a bad
influence on the others.

932
01:02:55,631 --> 01:02:58,156
Think about the people who are in jail.

933
01:02:58,267 --> 01:02:59,529
How will you face Abid up there?

934
01:02:59,635 --> 01:03:01,660
Why are you betraying your own people?

935
01:03:02,872 --> 01:03:06,137
Z ulfi atleast you do not say like this? I'm
betraying my people?

936
01:03:06,742 --> 01:03:08,471
Even I have suffered beatings for Abid's
sake.

937
01:03:08,578 --> 01:03:10,239
If you say you are supporting us, then why
do you wish..

938
01:03:10,346 --> 01:03:12,610
..to be separated from us by opening this
shop?

939
01:03:12,715 --> 01:03:13,850
My br other, I am not getting separated
from anyone.

940
01:03:13,850 --> 01:03:14,714
My br other, I am not getting separated
from anyone.

941
01:03:14,817 --> 01:03:17,718
I am opening my shop only because I want
to work.

942
01:03:18,454 --> 01:03:20,285
Why are you complicating the issue?

943
01:03:20,656 --> 01:03:22,647
It's you who's complicating the matter.

944
01:03:22,758 --> 01:03:24,817
What'll happen if I open my shop?

945
01:03:25,094 --> 01:03:26,391
Today you'll open your shop.

946
01:03:26,495 --> 01:03:27,553
Tomorrow someone else will open his
shop.

947
01:03:27,663 --> 01:03:28,789
Day after, someone else will open his shop.

948
01:03:28,898 --> 01:03:30,798
Wouldn't it affect our unity?

949
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:32,231
Remember.

950
01:03:32,602 --> 01:03:35,765
If you wish to stay in the community then
you have to stay together.

951
01:03:36,105 --> 01:03:38,665
Otherwise it will be difficult for us to do
business.

952
01:03:39,108 --> 01:03:41,099
No one will allow us to stay peacefully in
Allahabad.

953
01:03:41,310 --> 01:03:43,744
Br other Hashmat, listen to me.

954
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:47,215
You are awar e of how much we all love
you.

955
01:03:48,684 --> 01:03:49,878
As a Shopkeeper Association Lead..

956
01:03:50,152 --> 01:03:51,053
..I apologise on behalf of Mr. Kasuri and the
Maulana.

957
01:03:51,053 --> 01:03:52,714
..I apologise on behalf of Mr. Kasuri and the
Maulana.

958
01:03:53,155 --> 01:03:54,645
Come.

959
01:03:56,192 --> 01:03:57,887
Please give me the keys.

960
01:04:06,302 --> 01:04:09,705
Inayat, I have to complete this task.

961
01:04:09,705 --> 01:04:10,467
Inayat, I have to complete this task.

962
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:13,174
Look here, you are all my friends.

963
01:04:13,376 --> 01:04:15,435
I am even awar e that I will make all of you
unhappy..

964
01:04:15,544 --> 01:04:16,670
..by not listening to you.

965
01:04:16,779 --> 01:04:19,213
There is a voice within me which tells me..

966
01:04:19,315 --> 01:04:21,408
..that I should complete this task.

967
01:04:21,884 --> 01:04:23,852
How can I ignore it?

968
01:04:23,953 --> 01:04:26,183
Rafat, explain it to your father.

969
01:04:26,289 --> 01:04:27,620
This is not right.

970
01:04:27,723 --> 01:04:28,024
What important work is this that he is
fighting with everyone?

971
01:04:28,024 --> 01:04:30,857
What important work is this that he is
fighting with everyone?

972
01:04:31,294 --> 01:04:33,194
I'm not doing anything gr eat.

973
01:04:33,296 --> 01:04:35,457
I'm doing this task for a gr eat soul.

974
01:04:37,967 --> 01:04:39,832
Inayat, please give me the keys

975
01:04:39,936 --> 01:04:41,301
Don't give him the keys.

976
01:04:41,404 --> 01:04:42,564
How much money will you earn fr om this?

977
01:04:42,672 --> 01:04:44,139
We all will pitch in and pay you that
amount.

978
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:45,673
Hey, you. - Hey.

979
01:04:45,775 --> 01:04:46,676
Both of you keep quiet.

980
01:04:46,676 --> 01:04:47,370
Both of you keep quiet.

981
01:04:47,476 --> 01:04:48,738
You go.

982
01:04:49,578 --> 01:04:51,239
We'r e talking, aren't we?

983
01:04:52,615 --> 01:04:55,641
Look here, my dear. I'm not doing this for
money.

984
01:04:55,751 --> 01:05:00,279
Why don't you listen to Mr. Kasuri and the
priest's orders?

985
01:05:02,358 --> 01:05:04,155
Br other Inayat, do not hand him the keys.

986
01:05:04,260 --> 01:05:05,094
Let's see how he opens his shop.

987
01:05:05,094 --> 01:05:06,220
Let's see how he opens his shop.

988
01:05:06,696 --> 01:05:08,323
Give me the keys.

989
01:05:09,665 --> 01:05:11,257
Br other Inayat, give me the keys.

990
01:05:14,337 --> 01:05:16,271
Inayat, give me the keys. .. Give it.. Inayat
please give it

991
01:05:19,909 --> 01:05:21,900
I am sorry Hashmatbhai I am helpless ..

992
01:05:22,478 --> 01:05:23,813
..this is masjid's committee order & we
must obey it.

993
01:05:23,813 --> 01:05:25,337
..this is masjid's committee order & we
must obey it.

994
01:05:25,448 --> 01:05:27,678
Are you giving us the keys or not? - Keep
q uiet.

995
01:05:27,783 --> 01:05:30,274
Now, go home. Go home.

996
01:05:31,387 --> 01:05:33,878
And don't come till I ask you to. Go.

997
01:05:40,029 --> 01:05:41,964
Br other Inayat,just remember..

998
01:05:41,964 --> 01:05:44,194
Br other Inayat,just remember..

999
01:05:44,667 --> 01:05:46,965
..that I had not given you the keys.

1000
01:05:48,037 --> 01:05:49,868
You took it from me.

1001
01:05:50,706 --> 01:05:52,799
I'm not going to enter by breaking this
lock..

1002
01:05:52,908 --> 01:05:55,706
..and neither will I make another set of
keys.

1003
01:05:56,445 --> 01:05:58,345
I'm sitting her e at this doorstep.

1004
01:05:58,681 --> 01:06:00,750
And I will not move fr om here.

1005
01:06:01,450 --> 01:06:04,010
I will not open this shop..

1006
01:06:04,587 --> 01:06:06,612
..till you don't hand the keys to me.

1007
01:06:06,856 --> 01:06:09,416
It doesn't matter, if you give me the keys
today, tomorrow..

1008
01:06:09,525 --> 01:06:11,390
..or even after a year.

1009
01:06:12,328 --> 01:06:13,761
But you will give them to me.

1010
01:06:18,701 --> 01:06:19,435
And all of you, don't feel bad, please.

1011
01:06:19,435 --> 01:06:21,300
And all of you, don't feel bad, please.

1012
01:06:21,637 --> 01:06:26,904
But I would like to know if that vechicle
didn't belong to Gandhi..

1013
01:06:28,010 --> 01:06:31,241
..but to someone fr om your own religion or
to Jinnah..

1014
01:06:33,482 --> 01:06:35,245
..then would you have stopped me?

1015
01:07:28,604 --> 01:07:31,164
If he's hungry for the past two days, let him
be hungry.

1016
01:07:31,340 --> 01:07:33,103
At least you have your food.

1017
01:07:33,342 --> 01:07:35,674
What is there to think about?

1018
01:07:36,312 --> 01:07:38,246
He isn't doing anything, right?

1019
01:07:41,383 --> 01:07:44,352
How many times have I told you to pray
before you eat.

1020
01:07:44,453 --> 01:07:46,614
The thing I'm doing is more important
than prayers.

1021
01:07:46,722 --> 01:07:48,314
Stop talking.

1022
01:07:48,424 --> 01:07:51,484
I know how important it is.

1023
01:08:03,205 --> 01:08:05,799
Br other Hasmat. Brother Hashmat.

1024
01:08:11,747 --> 01:08:14,648
Here are the keys. Open the shop.

1025
01:08:21,190 --> 01:08:22,316
Are you giving it to me of your own
volition..

1026
01:08:22,424 --> 01:08:23,857
..or has someone forced you?

1027
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:25,793
I am willingly giving it to you.

1028
01:08:26,328 --> 01:08:29,064
But please do me a favour and don't tell
anyone about it.

1029
01:08:32,701 --> 01:08:36,398
If anyone asks me, I'll say that I don't know.

1030
01:08:36,839 --> 01:08:38,670
You're scar ed?

1031
01:08:40,509 --> 01:08:42,773
I'm not scared of anyone except Allah.

1032
01:08:43,479 --> 01:08:44,878
But what can I do?

1033
01:08:45,781 --> 01:08:47,449
I am under immense pr essure from the
servers of community

1034
01:08:47,449 --> 01:08:48,643
I am under immense pr essure from the
servers of community

1035
01:08:54,723 --> 01:08:56,418
You must have not eaten anything.

1036
01:09:00,396 --> 01:09:02,523
Come, we'll eat together. Come.

1037
01:09:02,631 --> 01:09:04,394
No, I will leave now.

1038
01:09:10,606 --> 01:09:11,766
Won't you go home?

1039
01:09:12,541 --> 01:09:15,601
I have a lot of work to do.. Lot of work

1040
01:09:16,278 --> 01:09:18,872
''He is the eternal truth.''

1041
01:09:18,981 --> 01:09:21,916
''Only His will rules.''

1042
01:09:22,184 --> 01:09:24,353
''Whoever follows His wish is a true
devotee.''

1043
01:09:24,353 --> 01:09:27,345
''Whoever follows His wish is a true
devotee.''

1044
01:09:27,856 --> 01:09:30,654
''He is the eternal truth.''

1045
01:09:30,759 --> 01:09:33,592
''Only His will rules.''

1046
01:09:33,696 --> 01:09:39,396
''Whoever follows His wish is a true
devotee.''

1047
01:09:39,501 --> 01:09:41,435
''The Lord is great..''

1048
01:09:42,238 --> 01:09:42,972
''The Lord is great. We all are His devotees.''

1049
01:09:42,972 --> 01:09:47,807
''The Lord is great. We all are His devotees.''

1050
01:09:47,910 --> 01:09:50,811
''He has cr eated all people.''

1051
01:09:50,913 --> 01:09:53,575
''Some are good and some are bad.''

1052
01:09:53,682 --> 01:09:59,416
''The Lord is great. We are all His devotees.''

1053
01:09:59,521 --> 01:10:01,657
''He has cr eated all people.''

1054
01:10:01,657 --> 01:10:02,385
''He has cr eated all people.''

1055
01:10:02,491 --> 01:10:05,221
''Some are good and some are bad.''

1056
01:10:05,327 --> 01:10:07,625
''The Lord is great..''

1057
01:10:11,567 --> 01:10:12,932
We have to stop him.

1058
01:10:14,536 --> 01:10:17,437
Otherwise, the orders issued by the
mosque will not have any value.

1059
01:10:17,673 --> 01:10:20,540
Don't worry. Nothing like that will happen.

1060
01:10:21,877 --> 01:10:24,311
You know many religious leaders.

1061
01:10:25,981 --> 01:10:27,710
Can't you tell them to issue some decree?

1062
01:10:27,883 --> 01:10:29,612
That will not be necessary.

1063
01:10:37,926 --> 01:10:42,761
Please do not for get to tell him. Goodbye.

1064
01:10:43,899 --> 01:10:45,423
What happened?

1065
01:10:45,901 --> 01:10:47,562
It was his father.

1066
01:10:48,404 --> 01:10:51,896
He was saying that he has gone to
Farukabad to his aunt's place.

1067
01:10:52,975 --> 01:10:54,533
Father, ther e are so many things to be
done.

1068
01:10:54,643 --> 01:10:56,577
Tell me how will we manage without
Salim?

1069
01:10:56,945 --> 01:10:59,573
This work will be done only if we get some
help.

1070
01:11:01,083 --> 01:11:05,383
I think he is at home. He's deliberately not
picking up the phone.

1071
01:11:06,855 --> 01:11:09,449
He has not even taken this month's salary?

1072
01:11:21,870 --> 01:11:24,634
Salim. - Mr. Hasmat.

1073
01:11:24,873 --> 01:11:25,862
Please come.

1074
01:11:25,974 --> 01:11:28,340
Father, Mr. Hashmat's here.

1075
01:11:28,744 --> 01:11:30,507
When did you come from Farukabad?

1076
01:11:30,946 --> 01:11:34,347
Today. I just came. Please come in.

1077
01:11:34,817 --> 01:11:36,614
Hello, Brother Hasmat. - Hello.

1078
01:11:36,785 --> 01:11:38,377
How come you're her e?

1079
01:11:38,487 --> 01:11:41,820
I heard that he has gone out and it was the
salary day.

1080
01:11:41,924 --> 01:11:46,327
So, I came to give his salary. - Yes.

1081
01:11:48,330 --> 01:11:50,696
Come on. Ther e is a lot of work in the shop,
come on.

1082
01:11:50,799 --> 01:11:55,327
Br other Hashmat, you go ahead. He'll
come as soon as the shop opens.

1083
01:11:55,671 --> 01:11:57,901
He works in my shop and it's open.

1084
01:11:58,540 --> 01:12:02,442
Br other Hasmat, why do you want to
involve my son in your problems?

1085
01:12:03,645 --> 01:12:06,705
Listen, if we have to stay within the
community and religion..

1086
01:12:06,949 --> 01:12:09,042
..then we have to observe certain norms
and adhere to the regulations..

1087
01:12:09,151 --> 01:12:10,846
..of r eligion as well as of the community.

1088
01:12:12,121 --> 01:12:17,354
Br other, it does not suit you to talk of
religion and community.

1089
01:12:18,527 --> 01:12:21,928
Everyone at Roshanganj is awar e..

1090
01:12:22,097 --> 01:12:25,362
..that you spend all your son's salary in
liquor.

1091
01:12:25,768 --> 01:12:28,999
And you have a wife who is younger to
your son.

1092
01:12:31,507 --> 01:12:34,374
Come, I am waiting for you outside.

1093
01:12:40,516 --> 01:12:43,349
Hello, Mr. Rizvi. - Hello.

1094
01:12:43,452 --> 01:12:44,919
What is the status of my work?

1095
01:12:45,020 --> 01:12:46,715
Look there. Your work is underway.

1096
01:12:46,822 --> 01:12:48,949
Please do it fast. I'm under a lot of stress.

1097
01:12:49,124 --> 01:12:50,921
Mr. Rizvi, rest assur ed.

1098
01:12:51,026 --> 01:12:53,119
These are few parts that ar e needed..

1099
01:12:53,228 --> 01:12:54,456
..please tell someone to bring them.

1100
01:12:54,797 --> 01:12:56,230
And as I am fixing the original parts just
like you told me to..

1101
01:12:56,398 --> 01:12:58,263
..after repairing them.

1102
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:00,263
Okay. Oh, yes.

1103
01:13:00,369 --> 01:13:01,802
He is Mr. Mishra.

1104
01:13:02,171 --> 01:13:04,332
He is an A-grade mechanic of our
Transport Section

1105
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:06,203
He considers you as his Guru.

1106
01:13:07,009 --> 01:13:08,977
He wishes to work with you on this pr oject.

1107
01:13:09,077 --> 01:13:12,012
Why not? You have come as a saviour.

1108
01:13:12,181 --> 01:13:14,843
When would you like to start? - Just now.

1109
01:13:15,017 --> 01:13:16,814
Lovely. Salim.

1110
01:13:17,553 --> 01:13:20,920
He is our A-grade mechanic. Mr. Mishra.
Assist him.

1111
01:13:23,992 --> 01:13:25,550
I heard that ther e was a lot of commotion
her e.

1112
01:13:25,828 --> 01:13:27,386
People closed down everything.

1113
01:13:27,563 --> 01:13:29,497
I hope our work will not be hamper ed.

1114
01:13:29,598 --> 01:13:31,566
It'll be r eady on time? Please do not put
me into a fix.

1115
01:13:31,834 --> 01:13:34,302
Sir, you have handed over the job to your
friend.

1116
01:13:34,403 --> 01:13:36,166
You have not given it to a Muslim engineer.

1117
01:13:36,405 --> 01:13:40,205
Let the entire world come to a halt, but
this machine will keep working.

1118
01:13:42,177 --> 01:13:44,372
Deliberately they are not coming.

1119
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:46,905
..so that they could not face me.

1120
01:13:47,516 --> 01:13:50,542
Has the mosque's committee put
restrictions on morning walks?

1121
01:13:50,819 --> 01:13:52,787
Ha.. Ha.. Good Joke!

1122
01:13:54,490 --> 01:13:57,220
Both of you have vast differ ence in
thoughts.

1123
01:13:57,493 --> 01:13:59,586
And differences don't mean fights.

1124
01:13:59,995 --> 01:14:02,589
Inayat realised it, so he gave you the keys.

1125
01:14:02,865 --> 01:14:05,993
When the others realise, they will start
talking to you too.

1126
01:14:09,838 --> 01:14:11,863
if they fail to understand?

1127
01:14:13,008 --> 01:14:15,067
Hashmat, what are you saying?

1128
01:14:15,177 --> 01:14:16,371
You are an engineer.

1129
01:14:16,578 --> 01:14:18,409
all the parts of the engine starts working. ..

1130
01:14:18,514 --> 01:14:21,005
If a small motor starts r otating.

1131
01:14:22,084 --> 01:14:25,247
The parts are rusted. - So oil them.

1132
01:14:25,354 --> 01:14:27,379
Come. Come.

1133
01:14:42,304 --> 01:14:47,970
''The Lord is great. We are all His devotees.''

1134
01:14:48,076 --> 01:14:50,977
''He has cr eated all people.''

1135
01:14:51,079 --> 01:14:53,445
''Some are good and some are bad.''

1136
01:14:53,649 --> 01:14:55,913
''The Lord is great..''

1137
01:14:56,885 --> 01:15:02,255
''The Lord is great. We are all His devotees.''

1138
01:15:02,357 --> 01:15:05,326
''He has cr eated all people.''

1139
01:15:05,427 --> 01:15:08,123
''Some are good and some are bad.''

1140
01:15:08,230 --> 01:15:10,164
''The Lord is great..

1141
01:15:11,033 --> 01:15:13,467
''The Lord is great..''

1142
01:15:21,209 --> 01:15:22,437
Greeting Hashmat..

1143
01:15:22,678 --> 01:15:24,270
How are you Zuber ?

1144
01:15:24,713 --> 01:15:27,477
You tell us .. what is the progress of engine
work

1145
01:15:27,950 --> 01:15:29,645
By the grace of god it will be done on time.

1146
01:15:32,020 --> 01:15:33,317
Listen !

1147
01:15:34,089 --> 01:15:35,920
No, my dear, I am in a little hurry.

1148
01:15:36,525 --> 01:15:38,493
You can leave at your will.

1149
01:15:38,594 --> 01:15:41,154
We are not inviting you for a party. How
are you Zuber?

1150
01:15:41,263 --> 01:15:44,198
Mr. Hashmat, what is this? Is this a part of
that engine?

1151
01:15:48,203 --> 01:15:52,333
Mr. Kasuri and the Maulana are doing so
much for this market.

1152
01:15:52,507 --> 01:15:54,270
Why are you doing this?

1153
01:15:56,011 --> 01:15:58,605
Z uber, you sit here all day and preach.

1154
01:15:59,114 --> 01:16:01,412
There on the stand you extract money
from the people.

1155
01:16:01,650 --> 01:16:05,017
Have I ever asked you to give me a reason
for your hooliganism?

1156
01:16:05,354 --> 01:16:07,584
Am I a goon? I am a goon, isn't it?

1157
01:16:07,689 --> 01:16:08,713
Here.

1158
01:16:08,991 --> 01:16:10,322
Here. See, I have snatched this from you.

1159
01:16:10,425 --> 01:16:12,052
What will you do?

1160
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:15,287
My dear, Z uber, please give this to me.

1161
01:16:15,464 --> 01:16:17,728
What will you do if I don't give it to you?

1162
01:16:18,567 --> 01:16:20,057
What ar e you doing? Give it to me.

1163
01:16:20,168 --> 01:16:22,602
What will you do if I don't give it to you?

1164
01:16:23,271 --> 01:16:25,102
Z uber, do not be obstinate. Give it to me.

1165
01:16:25,207 --> 01:16:27,300
What will you do if I don't give it to you?

1166
01:16:29,077 --> 01:16:31,705
I say, give it to me. -Then take this.

1167
01:16:39,254 --> 01:16:40,619
Come on. Give it to me.

1168
01:16:41,156 --> 01:16:42,350
Come on. Give it to me.

1169
01:16:42,457 --> 01:16:44,482
Please do not for ce me, for God's sake.

1170
01:16:51,133 --> 01:16:53,431
It doesn't look like you got this wound
from having fallen down.

1171
01:16:54,002 --> 01:16:55,993
Tell me the truth.

1172
01:16:56,538 --> 01:16:59,701
Doctor, may God save me from you.

1173
01:17:02,411 --> 01:17:04,003
Do you know Zuber?

1174
01:17:04,479 --> 01:17:06,106
The one who stands at the bus stand?

1175
01:17:06,214 --> 01:17:08,079
Yes. - He beat you?

1176
01:17:08,784 --> 01:17:10,251
We had a tussle.

1177
01:17:10,585 --> 01:17:12,018
You are out of your mind.

1178
01:17:12,187 --> 01:17:13,279
Come on. - Where?

1179
01:17:13,388 --> 01:17:14,616
Police station.

1180
01:17:15,123 --> 01:17:18,024
Doctor, leave it. Your blood pr essure will
rise unnecessarily.

1181
01:17:18,226 --> 01:17:19,523
What ar e you saying?

1182
01:17:19,628 --> 01:17:22,096
Against whom will you complain?

1183
01:17:22,431 --> 01:17:24,422
All ar e our kin.

1184
01:17:24,833 --> 01:17:27,131
Leave it. It'll only aggravate the matter.

1185
01:17:27,335 --> 01:17:30,566
I just cannot understand anything you say.

1186
01:17:31,573 --> 01:17:33,438
At times you talk on their behalf and at
times against them.

1187
01:17:33,542 --> 01:17:35,305
What if something drastic happens?

1188
01:17:35,410 --> 01:17:37,503
Doctor, at the most what can they do?

1189
01:17:37,713 --> 01:17:40,307
They will threaten me, beat me and at the
most kill me.

1190
01:17:40,415 --> 01:17:45,011
Okay. But they will not be able to curtail
my passion.

1191
01:17:45,754 --> 01:17:49,190
Great. Today you're talking like some
bravado.

1192
01:17:49,691 --> 01:17:52,660
Doctor, it is all His grace. Really.

1193
01:17:53,228 --> 01:17:55,093
I don't know what happened today.

1194
01:17:55,597 --> 01:17:58,623
I was not at all scared in front of Zuber.

1195
01:17:59,401 --> 01:18:03,667
I felt as if He's with me and is telling me to
face the truth. That's it.

1196
01:18:04,639 --> 01:18:08,166
Doctor, do you know, I did not even raise
my hand.

1197
01:18:08,443 --> 01:18:10,411
They ran away in fear.

1198
01:18:10,545 --> 01:18:13,105
What ar e you saying? - Yes. Really.

1199
01:18:13,515 --> 01:18:14,777
But why had you gone there?

1200
01:18:14,883 --> 01:18:18,080
Doctor, now allow me to leave.

1201
01:18:18,186 --> 01:18:19,244
I still have to visit Zulfi's house.

1202
01:18:19,354 --> 01:18:20,753
Shall I come with you? - No.

1203
01:18:20,889 --> 01:18:22,823
The bravados fight their battle by
themselves.

1204
01:18:23,091 --> 01:18:24,786
Great. But be careful.

1205
01:18:24,893 --> 01:18:27,794
Now they ar e not speaking, but are using
their power.

1206
01:18:27,896 --> 01:18:29,158
Take care of yourself.

1207
01:18:29,264 --> 01:18:30,697
Doctor, do not worry.

1208
01:18:31,266 --> 01:18:36,329
After today's incident I realised how much
str ength a man has.

1209
01:18:36,571 --> 01:18:39,506
I have learnt the skill of influencing people.

1210
01:18:39,608 --> 01:18:41,098
Great.

1211
01:18:41,376 --> 01:18:43,401
Good bye. - Goodbye.

1212
01:18:50,585 --> 01:18:53,076
No, no. This is absolutely wrong.

1213
01:18:53,388 --> 01:18:55,856
Tomorrow I will go and complain to Mr.
Kasuri about this.

1214
01:18:56,124 --> 01:18:58,354
No, no, do not go and complain to anyone.
Leave it.

1215
01:18:58,527 --> 01:19:00,893
Why shouldn't I complain? Why shouldn't
I?

1216
01:19:01,163 --> 01:19:04,326
A responsible person fr om our committee
is attacked..

1217
01:19:04,432 --> 01:19:06,127
..and we should all r emain q uiet?

1218
01:19:06,768 --> 01:19:08,201
Z ulfi, I liked..

1219
01:19:09,304 --> 01:19:13,570
..seeing that you'r e tr oubled by my pain.

1220
01:19:13,742 --> 01:19:16,472
How will I not be troubled? How will I not
be?

1221
01:19:16,611 --> 01:19:18,272
Are you a stranger to me?

1222
01:19:18,446 --> 01:19:21,813
That day because you were hell bent on
opening your shop that is why..

1223
01:19:23,585 --> 01:19:24,882
Tell me one thing.

1224
01:19:25,153 --> 01:19:27,417
What wer e you doing over there so late at
night?

1225
01:19:27,689 --> 01:19:32,592
I was coming to meet you. I want you to
gr oove bangles out of this.

1226
01:19:33,328 --> 01:19:35,387
See this. 0.3mm.

1227
01:19:35,664 --> 01:19:38,292
It is a very delicate job. I cannot do it.

1228
01:19:38,667 --> 01:19:40,828
Hashmat, why ar e you joking?

1229
01:19:43,271 --> 01:19:46,365
I am serious. I feel as if I have cataract.

1230
01:19:46,474 --> 01:19:48,567
I cannot see properly, so..

1231
01:19:55,650 --> 01:19:58,642
Hashmat, please forgive me.

1232
01:19:59,454 --> 01:20:00,887
I will not be able to do this.

1233
01:20:02,224 --> 01:20:05,489
If someone sees, there will be tr ouble.

1234
01:20:12,934 --> 01:20:14,367
What happened? Are you angry?

1235
01:20:15,136 --> 01:20:16,569
No, I am going.

1236
01:20:16,938 --> 01:20:18,235
No, no sit. At least have a cup of tea.

1237
01:20:18,340 --> 01:20:20,103
Someone please get tea.. - No, please leave
it.

1238
01:20:20,208 --> 01:20:22,904
If someone comes to know that you
offered me a cup of tea..

1239
01:20:23,011 --> 01:20:25,070
..then ther e will be trouble.

1240
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:26,508
Hashmat, you felt bad.

1241
01:20:26,615 --> 01:20:28,276
At least try and understand the problem.

1242
01:20:28,383 --> 01:20:30,510
Just now you were saying that I am not a
stranger.

1243
01:20:30,986 --> 01:20:33,420
We both have helped each other many
times.

1244
01:20:33,588 --> 01:20:35,954
Have you ever asked me whose this is or
what is this..

1245
01:20:36,057 --> 01:20:37,285
Please, lower your voice.

1246
01:20:37,392 --> 01:20:38,950
There is no need to shout.

1247
01:20:39,461 --> 01:20:42,521
There is no need to tell the whole world
that you ar e here.

1248
01:20:43,465 --> 01:20:45,057
I am coming with you.

1249
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:48,398
You start the scooter. I'll wear my shirt and
come.

1250
01:20:50,105 --> 01:20:54,201
Z ulfi, you will sit on one side of the scooter,
isn't it?

1251
01:20:54,976 --> 01:20:56,534
Why? Won't you be able to ride it?

1252
01:20:57,279 --> 01:20:59,645
No, I was thinking that after many years
someone..

1253
01:20:59,748 --> 01:21:03,548
..will sit one sided on my scooter.

1254
01:21:07,722 --> 01:21:10,953
I was feeling good as well as ashamed too..

1255
01:21:11,192 --> 01:21:13,626
That a pr oposal was brought for me. -
Then?

1256
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:15,252
What did I know?

1257
01:21:15,463 --> 01:21:18,694
I realised only when they started
discussing dowry..

1258
01:21:19,334 --> 01:21:22,462
..that he was not bringing a wife for me
but a wife for himself.

1259
01:21:28,410 --> 01:21:34,110
My dear, Salim, now you will have to make
a habit of this.

1260
01:21:35,417 --> 01:21:37,544
What ar e you all doing her e?

1261
01:21:37,752 --> 01:21:39,549
Just that.. here..

1262
01:21:39,821 --> 01:21:43,518
What ar e you doing here? - I was just..

1263
01:21:43,625 --> 01:21:44,785
What happened?

1264
01:21:45,193 --> 01:21:47,252
Nothing. I fell down in the dark.

1265
01:21:48,263 --> 01:21:50,629
Why are you standing with a sour face?
Come on.

1266
01:21:51,099 --> 01:21:53,567
He had warned me not to tell anyone.

1267
01:21:53,668 --> 01:21:56,296
And I too had promised him that I will not
tell anyone.

1268
01:21:56,404 --> 01:21:59,100
So I will not tell anyone, okay?

1269
01:21:59,307 --> 01:22:02,208
Okay, now do not try and act sweet. Give it
to me.

1270
01:22:03,111 --> 01:22:05,705
How many bangles do you want to make
from this? - Six.

1271
01:22:19,828 --> 01:22:22,160
0.3 mm. - Yes.

1272
01:22:22,263 --> 01:22:25,323
0.3 mm means 0.3 mm. Great.

1273
01:22:25,834 --> 01:22:28,735
Why are we gr ooving it twice? - Keep
quiet.

1274
01:22:29,437 --> 01:22:31,405
He just keeps talking nonsense.

1275
01:22:31,506 --> 01:22:34,168
Hashmat, you have already made it, isn't
it?

1276
01:22:34,442 --> 01:22:36,467
See, now do not lie to me.

1277
01:22:37,212 --> 01:22:38,736
Has he made them?

1278
01:22:46,855 --> 01:22:49,187
0.2 mm great

1279
01:22:50,425 --> 01:22:54,384
Hashmat, I know very well that there is no
other person in UP..

1280
01:22:54,629 --> 01:22:57,689
..who can groove better than you.

1281
01:22:58,133 --> 01:23:00,431
Then why ar e you making me do this?

1282
01:23:00,535 --> 01:23:03,060
I wanted to know whether you are in my
team..

1283
01:23:03,171 --> 01:23:05,105
..or with the people of the sect.

1284
01:23:06,474 --> 01:23:08,169
Now you can leave. At this hour of the
night old

1285
01:23:08,276 --> 01:23:10,301
..Children do not roam about. Go. Come
on.

1286
01:23:10,412 --> 01:23:12,573
Hashmat. - What?

1287
01:23:12,680 --> 01:23:14,875
Do not laugh. - Okay, do not laugh.

1288
01:23:15,150 --> 01:23:16,378
Yes.

1289
01:23:17,819 --> 01:23:21,152
I went to d rop him home and all the way
he was requesting me.

1290
01:23:21,523 --> 01:23:24,788
''Please do not tell anyone. You have the
oath of our friendship.''

1291
01:23:25,927 --> 01:23:27,758
At least it cheered you up.

1292
01:23:28,363 --> 01:23:30,593
And the rest Allah will teach a lesson to
those rascals.

1293
01:23:30,698 --> 01:23:33,132
Br other, what is this?

1294
01:23:34,135 --> 01:23:35,466
Are we all dead?

1295
01:23:35,570 --> 01:23:37,162
What happened? - What do you mean by
what happened?

1296
01:23:37,272 --> 01:23:40,435
Someone raised his hand on you and you
did not even tell us?

1297
01:23:40,942 --> 01:23:42,534
And we are standing here and arguing.

1298
01:23:42,644 --> 01:23:45,613
We should go and break bones of those
rascals.

1299
01:23:45,713 --> 01:23:47,112
Hey, wait.

1300
01:23:48,783 --> 01:23:51,911
Are you out of your senses? No one will do
anything.

1301
01:23:55,523 --> 01:23:58,686
You'll be repeating the same thing he did
last night.

1302
01:23:59,527 --> 01:24:00,824
What is the difference then?

1303
01:24:00,929 --> 01:24:02,658
Why are you talking like a child?

1304
01:24:03,932 --> 01:24:08,130
Br other, does my voice sound like a child's
voice?

1305
01:24:10,538 --> 01:24:14,304
Just think. I've profited from his beatings.

1306
01:24:17,645 --> 01:24:19,738
Till yesterday all of you wer e angry with
me..

1307
01:24:19,848 --> 01:24:21,440
..because I opened my shop.

1308
01:24:21,649 --> 01:24:24,777
But today all of you have come together
and are ready to fight for me.

1309
01:24:25,553 --> 01:24:26,781
Is this anything less?

1310
01:24:27,755 --> 01:24:31,316
Uncle, he should be punished for his
deeds.

1311
01:24:33,828 --> 01:24:37,559
My dear, only He has the right to punish.

1312
01:24:37,966 --> 01:24:40,526
The day you become God you punish him.

1313
01:24:40,635 --> 01:24:41,966
All of you go.

1314
01:24:43,538 --> 01:24:46,530
You have to do like this, understood?

1315
01:24:46,641 --> 01:24:50,168
Greetings, Brother. - Oh, my God.

1316
01:24:50,278 --> 01:24:52,576
You really scared.. What happened to you?

1317
01:24:52,680 --> 01:24:54,648
Nothing, I just fell in the dark.

1318
01:24:54,749 --> 01:24:57,775
So I thought I should get it checked from
you. - Go.

1319
01:24:57,886 --> 01:25:00,184
How are you, kid? Go, go, go, very good.

1320
01:25:00,288 --> 01:25:03,780
What is it? Has doctor Banerjee gone out
somewhere?

1321
01:25:03,892 --> 01:25:06,793
No. The doctor is himself very sick.

1322
01:25:06,961 --> 01:25:10,761
And your treatments are much better than
his modern medicines.

1323
01:25:10,865 --> 01:25:13,629
Now stop praising me unnecessarily like
this.

1324
01:25:13,768 --> 01:25:15,292
Now tell me what did you come here for?

1325
01:25:15,703 --> 01:25:17,466
I am really here to get tr eated.

1326
01:25:17,572 --> 01:25:18,766
The pain is unbearable.

1327
01:25:18,873 --> 01:25:23,640
That I cannot do. I am not as broad minded
as you.

1328
01:25:23,845 --> 01:25:25,540
We are God fearing people.

1329
01:25:28,683 --> 01:25:31,015
Go, my shop is closed.

1330
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:35,346
You're a doctor. These rules are not
applicable to you.

1331
01:25:35,857 --> 01:25:38,485
And till now I have never r ealised..

1332
01:25:38,593 --> 01:25:41,721
..whether your clinic is in your house or is it
the other way around.

1333
01:25:41,963 --> 01:25:46,263
In my house.. No, my house is in my shop.

1334
01:25:47,268 --> 01:25:48,428
Do you have any problem?

1335
01:25:48,536 --> 01:25:49,730
Doctor, you ar e gr eat.

1336
01:25:50,438 --> 01:25:53,407
Will you not treat a lady who is going to
deliver a child..

1337
01:25:53,608 --> 01:25:55,235
..or a person who is going to die?

1338
01:25:55,577 --> 01:25:59,479
Look here. I told you, my shop is closed.

1339
01:25:59,781 --> 01:26:01,043
Now, please go.

1340
01:26:03,484 --> 01:26:06,885
If your son or your grandchild is sick then..

1341
01:26:14,963 --> 01:26:17,625
Don't you think that some people's
feelings awaken..

1342
01:26:17,865 --> 01:26:19,992
..only for their own kin?

1343
01:26:23,371 --> 01:26:24,633
How can you say that?

1344
01:26:25,039 --> 01:26:26,233
Prove me wrong.

1345
01:26:27,108 --> 01:26:30,043
When was the last time people celebrated
Indian cricket team's win..

1346
01:26:30,144 --> 01:26:31,475
..by bursting firecrackers in our colony?

1347
01:26:33,381 --> 01:26:36,475
And I can show you portraits of Shoaib
Akhtar, Inzamam..

1348
01:26:36,718 --> 01:26:40,176
..even snaps of Pervez Musharraf, Osama..

1349
01:26:40,521 --> 01:26:44,355
..and Saddam Hussain, in shops, horse
carts and saloons here.

1350
01:26:47,595 --> 01:26:49,222
What is wrong in that?

1351
01:26:49,397 --> 01:26:52,059
Even I do not say that this is wrong.

1352
01:26:53,034 --> 01:26:54,558
It is only in this country that everyone has
a right..

1353
01:26:54,669 --> 01:26:56,159
..to express their feelings.

1354
01:26:56,571 --> 01:27:01,201
So when I got an opportunity to serve my
country through my skill

1355
01:27:01,676 --> 01:27:04,474
My country was my first preference.

1356
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:08,909
After that my own and the feelings of my
kin.

1357
01:27:11,686 --> 01:27:13,916
That is why my shop is open.

1358
01:27:14,222 --> 01:27:15,621
And yours is closed.

1359
01:27:16,691 --> 01:27:19,387
I am going. Goodbye. - Listen.

1360
01:27:21,963 --> 01:27:23,191
This is bitter.

1361
01:27:23,298 --> 01:27:25,289
Mix it with honey and have it in the
morning and the evening.

1362
01:27:25,400 --> 01:27:26,958
The pain will subside.

1363
01:27:27,302 --> 01:27:29,202
And please for God's sake do not tell
anyone..

1364
01:27:29,304 --> 01:27:31,568
..that I have given you this medicine.

1365
01:27:32,707 --> 01:27:36,234
You be rest assured. Okay.

1366
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:53,486
What's the matter?

1367
01:27:53,995 --> 01:27:55,087
God knows.

1368
01:27:55,196 --> 01:27:57,460
Maybe, the court has issued everyone's
release orders.

1369
01:27:57,565 --> 01:27:58,998
Thank God.

1370
01:28:01,069 --> 01:28:03,060
Don't you know?

1371
01:28:03,671 --> 01:28:06,504
The home minister himself apologised to
Mr. Kasuri.

1372
01:28:07,108 --> 01:28:08,507
The police were given a good firing.

1373
01:28:08,609 --> 01:28:11,339
He even dismissed two police officers.

1374
01:28:11,646 --> 01:28:13,170
They're r eleasing Abid.

1375
01:28:13,381 --> 01:28:15,212
All the members of the committee are
going to jail..

1376
01:28:15,383 --> 01:28:16,441
..to bring him back.

1377
01:28:20,121 --> 01:28:21,145
Strange?

1378
01:28:21,389 --> 01:28:23,323
Why didn't they call me?

1379
01:28:24,759 --> 01:28:26,124
Okay.

1380
01:28:30,198 --> 01:28:30,665
Tell me. Is this the right thing?

1381
01:28:30,665 --> 01:28:32,724
Tell me. Is this the right thing?

1382
01:28:33,234 --> 01:28:37,170
But he doesn't want to listen to anybody.

1383
01:28:42,710 --> 01:28:44,644
Abid, how ar e you?

1384
01:28:44,812 --> 01:28:47,679
Take a look. He's still alive.

1385
01:28:48,516 --> 01:28:51,417
Priest. - Inayat, let him talk.

1386
01:28:52,086 --> 01:28:54,486
The people whom you favoured and
betrayed us.

1387
01:28:55,189 --> 01:28:59,216
This is what their dreadful officials have
done in remand. Look at him.

1388
01:29:00,828 --> 01:29:03,456
I regret.. - You're lying.

1389
01:29:03,831 --> 01:29:05,822
You don't regr et it at all.

1390
01:29:06,267 --> 01:29:09,065
You don't regr et his condition, or Farhan's
death.

1391
01:29:12,540 --> 01:29:15,475
You're still angry with me?

1392
01:29:16,110 --> 01:29:17,475
You didn't even call me?

1393
01:29:17,812 --> 01:29:21,714
I'm r eady to apologise if I've wronged you.

1394
01:29:22,150 --> 01:29:25,847
If you feel, by apologising for your sins..

1395
01:29:26,120 --> 01:29:28,384
..you can avert punishment, you ar e
wrong.

1396
01:29:28,489 --> 01:29:30,821
You will be punished, because He's
watching everything.

1397
01:29:31,626 --> 01:29:34,686
You are equally responsible for his
condition..

1398
01:29:34,796 --> 01:29:36,525
..as much as the government and the
police.

1399
01:29:37,331 --> 01:29:40,425
Priest, this is not the right place to argue.

1400
01:29:41,169 --> 01:29:43,501
Hasmat, please come later.

1401
01:29:46,808 --> 01:29:49,106
May Allah help you get well soon.

1402
01:29:49,210 --> 01:29:51,110
Mewalal - Stop.

1403
01:29:51,612 --> 01:29:53,341
Take your apples back.

1404
01:29:54,282 --> 01:29:56,773
No one r equires your sympathy her e.

1405
01:29:59,454 --> 01:30:01,319
I can understand everyone's anger.

1406
01:30:01,756 --> 01:30:05,886
But Kasuri, we cannot hold the
government and the police responsible..

1407
01:30:06,461 --> 01:30:08,759
..and turn our backs on our responsibilities.

1408
01:30:09,730 --> 01:30:13,325
Think about it. Who ar e the terr orists?

1409
01:30:13,801 --> 01:30:16,497
And what will you call the ones that give
them refuge?

1410
01:30:16,604 --> 01:30:17,628
Stop it.

1411
01:30:18,806 --> 01:30:20,603
That's all that was left.

1412
01:30:21,309 --> 01:30:24,676
Muslims like you slander Islam.

1413
01:30:26,314 --> 01:30:32,412
A true Muslim is the one that never hurts
anyone in anyway.

1414
01:30:35,223 --> 01:30:38,317
When will we understand that people who
intend harm do their job..

1415
01:30:38,426 --> 01:30:41,793
..and here our entire race comes under
scrutiny.

1416
01:30:42,864 --> 01:30:44,422
We'r e responsible for..

1417
01:30:44,532 --> 01:30:48,525
..Abid's condition as much as the police
and the government.

1418
01:31:08,789 --> 01:31:09,847
Take care.

1419
01:31:09,957 --> 01:31:12,653
I'm leaving. Take care. I'll come again.

1420
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:21,161
Keep it.

1421
01:31:26,674 --> 01:31:29,609
Date is 1 2th, isn't it? - Yes.

1422
01:31:29,977 --> 01:31:31,808
It's quite close.

1423
01:31:33,681 --> 01:31:35,171
Boss. - Yes.

1424
01:31:36,250 --> 01:31:37,774
Dr. Verma says.

1425
01:31:39,320 --> 01:31:42,255
On the 1 2th of February, 1 948.

1426
01:31:42,990 --> 01:31:45,390
The day, the urn was immersed.

1427
01:31:46,627 --> 01:31:51,621
That day, all the righteousness and
honesty was immersed with the urn.

1428
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:54,493
That's absolutely right.

1429
01:31:57,271 --> 01:31:59,831
Tell me, what was its average before? Five
or six?

1430
01:31:59,941 --> 01:32:01,806
Six. - Six.

1431
01:32:02,043 --> 01:32:03,601
I was thinking..

1432
01:32:04,045 --> 01:32:06,445
..now since it's back to its original
condition..

1433
01:32:06,547 --> 01:32:08,515
..so let's give it an average of six as well.

1434
01:32:08,749 --> 01:32:11,240
That will be wonderful.

1435
01:32:11,619 --> 01:32:14,019
Hello. - Gaffar, hello. How nice of you to be
here.

1436
01:32:14,488 --> 01:32:17,582
These days I don't see you in the morning.

1437
01:32:17,692 --> 01:32:18,750
You're afraid of losing, right?

1438
01:32:18,859 --> 01:32:24,297
You think Dr. Banerjee's apples will make
you win.

1439
01:32:24,398 --> 01:32:26,491
Meet me tomorrow morning, we will see.

1440
01:32:27,234 --> 01:32:30,465
Hashmat, you have to come tomorrow.

1441
01:32:33,174 --> 01:32:35,369
The committee has summoned you.

1442
01:32:39,113 --> 01:32:40,273
Will you come?

1443
01:32:42,116 --> 01:32:44,710
I'll have to. After all, the committee has
summoned me.

1444
01:32:45,987 --> 01:32:49,252
Please consider your decision. Take my
advice, don't come.

1445
01:32:51,559 --> 01:32:52,821
I will leave.

1446
01:32:55,096 --> 01:32:57,963
The law of the mosque is same for
everyone.

1447
01:32:58,232 --> 01:33:01,030
Hasmat Ullah, went against the order..

1448
01:33:01,235 --> 01:33:02,532
..and opened his shop.

1449
01:33:03,104 --> 01:33:05,834
Hence, the committee members have
decided..

1450
01:33:06,240 --> 01:33:08,834
..that you have to resign from the post of
general secr etary.

1451
01:33:08,943 --> 01:33:12,242
I don't agree to this decision. - He is also
fined Rs.1 0,000.

1452
01:33:12,546 --> 01:33:14,343
He should deposit this amount in the
mosque's fund.

1453
01:33:14,448 --> 01:33:16,416
I haven't done anything wr ong. And I
won't pay the fine either.

1454
01:33:16,517 --> 01:33:20,920
And give a written apology to all members
and shop owners..

1455
01:33:21,022 --> 01:33:23,047
..assuring that you won't make the same
mistake in the future.

1456
01:33:23,157 --> 01:33:25,785
Otherwise, he'll be boycotted.

1457
01:33:27,128 --> 01:33:29,119
I refuse to do that either.

1458
01:33:33,601 --> 01:33:35,262
Hashmat Ullah..

1459
01:33:38,806 --> 01:33:42,242
..I gave you a chance because Mr. Kasuri
insisted me to.

1460
01:33:43,077 --> 01:33:44,544
To mend your mistake..

1461
01:33:45,980 --> 01:33:48,540
..so that you can face Allah on doomsday.

1462
01:33:50,351 --> 01:33:53,843
But unfortunately, you refused to take that
chance.

1463
01:33:54,488 --> 01:33:58,891
Priest, whenever I would want to please
Allah..

1464
01:33:59,393 --> 01:34:02,021
..I won't need a third person.

1465
01:34:03,030 --> 01:34:04,520
I will pray for all you.

1466
01:34:04,632 --> 01:34:04,732
''My desir es comes on my lips in form of
prayers.''

1467
01:34:04,732 --> 01:34:16,610
''My desir es comes on my lips in form of
prayers.''

1468
01:34:29,023 --> 01:34:38,898
''My desir es comes on my lips in form of
prayers.''

1469
01:34:40,034 --> 01:34:49,534
''My desir es comes on my lips in form of
prayers.''

1470
01:34:51,011 --> 01:35:00,579
''My Life should be like the shimmering
lig ht.''

1471
01:35:01,989 --> 01:35:11,921
''My desir es comes on my lips in form of
prayers.''

1472
01:35:26,580 --> 01:35:37,479
''If I can alleviate the darkness in the
world..''

1473
01:35:37,591 --> 01:35:47,523
''If I can alleviate the darkness in the
world..''

1474
01:35:48,269 --> 01:35:59,271
''..I wish to spread my light everywhere.''

1475
01:36:02,950 --> 01:36:12,120
''Let my every breath make my land
wond rous.''

1476
01:36:13,694 --> 01:36:16,128
Listen, you couldn't find a dynamo, right?

1477
01:36:16,330 --> 01:36:17,991
A patient of mine from Hathganva..

1478
01:36:18,098 --> 01:36:20,066
..has sent a V8 dynamo in r eturn for my
treatment.

1479
01:36:20,167 --> 01:36:21,259
Will it help you in anyway?

1480
01:36:21,368 --> 01:36:24,166
Doctor, why ar e you taking such trouble
for me?

1481
01:36:24,271 --> 01:36:28,037
Keep quiet. You're trying to kick-start a
stalled car.

1482
01:36:28,375 --> 01:36:33,039
I might be one of the many to touch the
urn that'd be kept on it..

1483
01:36:33,247 --> 01:36:34,976
..asking for for giveness.

1484
01:36:38,152 --> 01:36:48,084
''May I always tread the path of
knowledge.''

1485
01:36:49,129 --> 01:36:59,369
''My duty should always favour the poor.''

1486
01:36:59,640 --> 01:37:10,380
''Always love the poor and the deprived.''

1487
01:37:20,794 --> 01:37:31,500
''Allah, save me from being a sinner.''

1488
01:37:32,273 --> 01:37:43,081
''Always help me tread the honest path.''

1489
01:38:08,676 --> 01:38:10,735
Boss, it is working.

1490
01:38:11,278 --> 01:38:13,439
It's almost finished.

1491
01:38:13,681 --> 01:38:15,512
It's almost done.

1492
01:38:15,783 --> 01:38:17,045
Rafat. - Yes.

1493
01:38:17,151 --> 01:38:18,778
Call Salim. Where is he?

1494
01:38:18,886 --> 01:38:20,513
Yes, I am, Father.

1495
01:38:22,389 --> 01:38:25,381
You have been dialling for the past one
hour.

1496
01:38:28,662 --> 01:38:29,720
Father. - Yes. - Wait.

1497
01:38:29,830 --> 01:38:31,195
Wait.

1498
01:38:34,868 --> 01:38:37,336
Farhan's father has arrived from Dubai.

1499
01:38:38,539 --> 01:38:40,700
They have gone to the graveyard to say
the prayers.

1500
01:38:41,275 --> 01:38:42,469
He'll be here soon.

1501
01:38:44,545 --> 01:38:46,513
Why didn't you tell me before?

1502
01:38:46,880 --> 01:38:50,213
I thought you're busy with work and so.. -
What work?

1503
01:38:50,517 --> 01:38:52,508
If you can't share anyone's happiness..

1504
01:38:52,619 --> 01:38:54,109
..you must share their sorr ows.

1505
01:38:54,355 --> 01:38:56,323
And Mr. Kasuri is not our enemy.

1506
01:38:56,757 --> 01:39:00,693
But if you go there uninvited, they might
sully you.

1507
01:39:01,528 --> 01:39:03,393
Have they arranged for a Koran r ecitation?

1508
01:39:03,630 --> 01:39:04,722
What?

1509
01:39:05,833 --> 01:39:08,631
You mean to say you will go to their house.
- Yes, why not?

1510
01:39:09,169 --> 01:39:12,661
Keep your own house clean, and not the
neighbours? That's not right.

1511
01:39:12,773 --> 01:39:13,899
Come on.

1512
01:39:55,516 --> 01:39:56,540
Yes.

1513
01:39:57,684 --> 01:40:00,278
He has thanked you for coming here.

1514
01:40:00,454 --> 01:40:02,513
He's the chairman and so he's compelled.

1515
01:40:02,689 --> 01:40:05,886
He can't give you the permission to sit with
the sect.

1516
01:40:07,494 --> 01:40:09,792
Where are you going? - Inside.

1517
01:40:10,364 --> 01:40:12,389
I told you, meet him some other day.

1518
01:40:12,766 --> 01:40:14,791
He's not feeling well.

1519
01:40:15,536 --> 01:40:17,629
I want to meet him. - What is this
misbehaviour?

1520
01:40:17,738 --> 01:40:19,763
I want to meet him right now. - Hashmat

1521
01:40:20,808 --> 01:40:25,677
Noorez. Noorez. Noorez.

1522
01:40:27,815 --> 01:40:28,839
Yes.

1523
01:40:28,982 --> 01:40:31,712
Please show him the way out. Go.

1524
01:40:32,586 --> 01:40:34,451
Come.

1525
01:40:34,555 --> 01:40:36,785
Hurry up. - Wait.

1526
01:40:38,559 --> 01:40:42,893
Mr. Maulana, please go inside. I will talk to
him.

1527
01:40:45,466 --> 01:40:46,626
Ashfaqae

1528
01:40:49,603 --> 01:40:51,867
Why do you want to get embarrassed?

1529
01:40:52,406 --> 01:40:54,499
Why have you come here uninvited?

1530
01:40:54,908 --> 01:40:57,376
You didn't come here for years, but you
had the audacity to come here today.

1531
01:40:57,544 --> 01:40:59,478
Are you enjoying doing all this?

1532
01:40:59,680 --> 01:41:01,341
What was the need to break the pr omise?

1533
01:41:01,448 --> 01:41:02,847
Why have you come here?

1534
01:41:03,250 --> 01:41:04,774
Why don't you say something?

1535
01:41:07,921 --> 01:41:09,616
I don't have any grievances.

1536
01:41:10,357 --> 01:41:13,451
Instead, I am enjoying this. Really. I mean
it.

1537
01:41:13,560 --> 01:41:18,554
Are you crazy? - I haven't seen my soul or
God.

1538
01:41:18,932 --> 01:41:21,457
But whenever I will wish to have true
friends..

1539
01:41:21,702 --> 01:41:24,262
..I will surely see the three of you.

1540
01:41:26,140 --> 01:41:30,372
I am leaving. Really. I won't tell anyone
anything.

1541
01:41:49,563 --> 01:41:51,656
There was very little work left, and..

1542
01:41:51,765 --> 01:41:54,700
So, what's the problem? We are here to
help you.

1543
01:41:54,801 --> 01:41:57,895
You're a jinx. Your arrival brought this
power outage.

1544
01:41:58,172 --> 01:42:00,470
What ar e you grieving about Hashmat?

1545
01:42:00,574 --> 01:42:02,599
I'll make electricity appear from nowhere.

1546
01:42:04,378 --> 01:42:09,247
''The one who is a Vaishnav (Follower of
Lord Vishnu)..''

1547
01:42:09,349 --> 01:42:12,477
''..Knows the pain of others.''

1548
01:42:13,253 --> 01:42:17,883
What ar e you looking at? Tighten it. - Yes,
do it.

1549
01:42:44,851 --> 01:42:49,447
''He tolerates and praises the entire world''

1550
01:42:52,926 --> 01:42:58,387
''He tolerates and praises the entire world''

1551
01:43:54,821 --> 01:43:58,780
''He sees everything eq ually, r ejects greed
and avarice.''

1552
01:43:58,892 --> 01:44:02,919
''Considers women as his mother.''

1553
01:44:04,731 --> 01:44:08,895
''He never hesitates to speak the truth.''

1554
01:44:09,002 --> 01:44:12,665
''He never hesitates to speak the truth.''

1555
01:44:12,773 --> 01:44:16,641
''Does not eye others property.''

1556
01:44:17,010 --> 01:44:21,071
''The one who is a Vaishnav.''

1557
01:44:21,348 --> 01:44:24,840
''The one who is a Vaishnav.''

1558
01:44:24,951 --> 01:44:28,944
''Knows the pain of others.''

1559
01:44:29,356 --> 01:44:33,349
''The one who is a Vaishnav.''

1560
01:45:09,763 --> 01:45:11,321
Hello, Doctor.

1561
01:45:12,399 --> 01:45:14,390
I saw a wonderful dream.

1562
01:45:15,335 --> 01:45:17,565
And I am dying to tell you about it.

1563
01:45:17,738 --> 01:45:20,571
Really? It's 3 o'clock in the morning.

1564
01:45:20,674 --> 01:45:24,166
I'll be there in the morning for your last
rites. Fine?

1565
01:45:24,277 --> 01:45:27,678
Okay. Okay.

1566
01:45:43,764 --> 01:45:47,256
But, Mr. Hashmat, why do you want the
vehicle to pass your ar ea?

1567
01:45:48,802 --> 01:45:50,997
I don't know. But my heart says..

1568
01:45:51,171 --> 01:45:54,163
..that every Muslim fr om my area will walk
to the confluence..

1569
01:45:54,341 --> 01:45:56,468
..and will pay homage to this great soul.

1570
01:45:57,310 --> 01:46:01,303
That's a good thought, but.. - Please don't
refuse.

1571
01:46:01,782 --> 01:46:06,776
I want to prove, that we are as patriotic as
the others.

1572
01:46:07,587 --> 01:46:10,385
If we can close down our shops to protest
against the government..

1573
01:46:10,490 --> 01:46:12,355
..then we can close down our shops..

1574
01:46:12,459 --> 01:46:14,222
..to be a part of this last journey.

1575
01:46:14,428 --> 01:46:17,363
That's fine. We have very little time left.

1576
01:46:18,632 --> 01:46:24,036
But the thing is.. Okay, if you are
requesting us, then we will try.

1577
01:46:24,237 --> 01:46:27,070
But it's your duty to inform your people.

1578
01:46:27,174 --> 01:46:30,803
And I will try to get the permission from
higher authorities

1579
01:46:32,045 --> 01:46:34,104
Thank you very much. - Thank you.

1580
01:46:34,281 --> 01:46:36,579
You don't have to thank us for it.

1581
01:46:36,683 --> 01:46:39,151
We have undertaken this task..

1582
01:46:39,252 --> 01:46:43,780
..so that people should know about
Gandhi's thoughts

1583
01:46:46,626 --> 01:46:48,560
Doctor, lets go.

1584
01:46:49,529 --> 01:46:51,520
What's up in your mind?

1585
01:46:51,832 --> 01:46:54,232
I think this is impossible.

1586
01:46:55,235 --> 01:46:58,204
Love can make everything possible,
Doctor.

1587
01:46:58,638 --> 01:47:01,198
But how will you give them the news.

1588
01:47:01,308 --> 01:47:03,139
They ar e not in talking terms with you.

1589
01:47:03,710 --> 01:47:06,508
Just watch. They will call me themselves.

1590
01:47:07,180 --> 01:47:08,238
How?

1591
01:47:09,216 --> 01:47:11,582
Doctor, you said it yourself..

1592
01:47:11,685 --> 01:47:15,485
..any big machine need small nuts and
bolts to fasten them.

1593
01:47:16,823 --> 01:47:19,189
I feel you have gone crazy.

1594
01:47:29,803 --> 01:47:36,140
Make sure you don't miss any nook, corner,
roof, alleys, anything, okay?

1595
01:47:41,648 --> 01:47:44,116
We don't want kites, we want a cricket kit.

1596
01:47:44,217 --> 01:47:46,651
Yes, we want a cricket kit.

1597
01:47:46,853 --> 01:47:48,582
Why do you want to burn holes in my
pockets?

1598
01:47:48,755 --> 01:47:50,518
Cricket is such a silly game.

1599
01:47:50,624 --> 01:47:53,684
Hit the ball to a distance and it's a
boundary. That's it.

1600
01:47:53,860 --> 01:47:56,727
But this has no boundary. It can go
anywhere.

1601
01:47:57,163 --> 01:47:59,859
And you can't get out either. Go.

1602
01:48:00,300 --> 01:48:02,325
Take this message to every household. Go.

1603
01:48:02,435 --> 01:48:02,736
Yes, sir.

1604
01:48:02,736 --> 01:48:05,102
Yes, sir.

1605
01:48:07,607 --> 01:48:12,408
''AVaishnav does not succumb to world ly
attachments.''

1606
01:48:15,749 --> 01:48:19,617
''He does not succumb to worldly
attachments.''

1607
01:48:19,719 --> 01:48:24,418
''Has staunchly detached himself from all
worldly pleasure.''

1608
01:48:25,725 --> 01:48:29,661
''Is addicted to the elixir coming by the
name of Ram.''

1609
01:48:29,763 --> 01:48:33,665
''Is addicted to the elixir coming by the
name of Ram.''

1610
01:48:33,767 --> 01:48:38,363
''For whom all the religious sites are in the
mind.''

1611
01:48:42,375 --> 01:48:45,833
''The one who is a Vaishnav.''

1612
01:48:45,946 --> 01:48:50,144
''Knows the pain of others.''

1613
01:48:50,383 --> 01:48:54,717
''The one who is a Vaishnav..''

1614
01:49:09,970 --> 01:49:14,304
''..has no greed and deceit.''

1615
01:49:18,044 --> 01:49:21,878
''Has no greed and deceit.''

1616
01:49:22,148 --> 01:49:25,345
''He has renounced desir e and anger in all
it's form. '' - The planet earth..

1617
01:49:25,452 --> 01:49:27,852
..basically, all the ecosystems ar e obtained..

1618
01:49:27,954 --> 01:49:30,855
..in which plants produce life.

1619
01:49:30,957 --> 01:49:32,356
Plants are the producers.

1620
01:49:32,459 --> 01:49:36,156
The plants are an important part of our
ecosystem.

1621
01:49:36,262 --> 01:49:40,323
It's..the main part.

1622
01:49:40,433 --> 01:49:44,392
5..6..7..8.. - ''The one who is a Vaishnav.''

1623
01:49:44,504 --> 01:49:48,031
1 ..2..3.. - ''The one who is a Vaishnav.''

1624
01:49:48,141 --> 01:49:52,202
''Knows the pain of others.''

1625
01:49:52,746 --> 01:49:56,682
''Does good to others, to the ones who are
in misery in particular.''

1626
01:49:56,783 --> 01:50:00,344
''Does good to others, to the ones who are
in misery in particular.''

1627
01:50:00,453 --> 01:50:04,719
''Does not let pride enter his mind.''

1628
01:50:04,824 --> 01:50:08,783
''One who is a Vaishnav.''

1629
01:50:12,265 --> 01:50:12,499
What is this? You are forgetting.

1630
01:50:12,499 --> 01:50:14,126
What is this? You are forgetting.

1631
01:50:14,234 --> 01:50:15,792
You are no more the general secretary of
the mosque..

1632
01:50:15,902 --> 01:50:17,301
..and you're no mor e the part of this sect.

1633
01:50:17,404 --> 01:50:19,031
Who gave you the permission to..

1634
01:50:19,139 --> 01:50:21,403
..make such an appeal to the people?

1635
01:50:21,875 --> 01:50:23,502
I did this for a good cause.

1636
01:50:23,777 --> 01:50:26,439
But the people will think that the
committee has made this appeal.

1637
01:50:26,546 --> 01:50:29,310
So what's bad about it? - It's not about
good or bad.

1638
01:50:29,416 --> 01:50:32,408
How can you exercise rights that you no
longer have?

1639
01:50:32,519 --> 01:50:35,249
I did it with good intentions, but the
people..

1640
01:50:35,355 --> 01:50:36,982
Fine, we hear d your appeal.

1641
01:50:37,090 --> 01:50:39,285
So please, you can leave now. Go.

1642
01:50:39,392 --> 01:50:41,257
Let him say what he wants to. - Please keep
quiet.

1643
01:50:41,361 --> 01:50:43,192
No, I want to say something. - Listen, this is
wrong.

1644
01:50:43,296 --> 01:50:45,764
You weren't called here to add ress the
people.

1645
01:50:45,865 --> 01:50:48,197
Please leave. - I request everyone to be a
part of this journey.

1646
01:50:48,301 --> 01:50:49,893
These are testing times.

1647
01:50:50,070 --> 01:50:52,334
And if we hold back now.

1648
01:50:52,806 --> 01:50:55,331
We will have to ask ourselves a question.

1649
01:50:55,542 --> 01:50:57,908
What ar e we doing in this country?

1650
01:50:58,478 --> 01:51:02,744
If we can't honour the leader who got us
freedom..

1651
01:51:02,982 --> 01:51:05,041
..then, what ar e we here for?

1652
01:51:06,486 --> 01:51:07,953
Are we just guests here?

1653
01:51:09,989 --> 01:51:12,890
We are all I ndians. And this is our country.

1654
01:51:14,461 --> 01:51:17,555
Tomorrow, that personality will pass
through our area..

1655
01:51:19,099 --> 01:51:21,226
..riding on the vehicle that I built.

1656
01:51:22,135 --> 01:51:24,433
And each one of you here..

1657
01:51:24,604 --> 01:51:28,062
..has encouraged me to build that vehicle.

1658
01:51:28,174 --> 01:51:31,007
Allah will never forgive you on doomsday.

1659
01:51:31,177 --> 01:51:32,371
Go from here.

1660
01:51:33,079 --> 01:51:37,140
Allah can never be so selfish. He does not
discriminate.

1661
01:51:39,619 --> 01:51:40,847
Good bye.

1662
01:51:45,592 --> 01:51:48,254
Okay. We'll see about that.

1663
01:51:49,362 --> 01:51:50,488
Good bye.

1664
01:51:52,832 --> 01:51:54,857
No, let it be. - Please, take it.

1665
01:51:54,968 --> 01:51:57,061
It's very sour. Later.

1666
01:52:00,874 --> 01:52:02,239
Greetings, Kasuri.

1667
01:52:03,309 --> 01:52:07,075
How are you, Shehnaz? - Come, take a seat.

1668
01:52:10,550 --> 01:52:12,575
I couldn't stop myself when I heard.

1669
01:52:15,121 --> 01:52:16,816
How are you now?

1670
01:52:19,659 --> 01:52:21,286
You must be surprised.

1671
01:52:21,494 --> 01:52:22,518
I haven't visited you for a long time..

1672
01:52:22,629 --> 01:52:24,358
..but nowadays I am coming her e
frequently.

1673
01:52:24,464 --> 01:52:26,398
Why should I be surprised?

1674
01:52:26,933 --> 01:52:29,629
I've never stopped anyone from coming
here.

1675
01:52:31,070 --> 01:52:32,628
You didn't call me either.

1676
01:52:37,177 --> 01:52:39,202
Why did you come here today?

1677
01:52:40,613 --> 01:52:45,209
I am sur e you know that we have finished
building the engine.

1678
01:52:45,485 --> 01:52:47,282
And tomorrow we will place Gandhi's urn
on it..

1679
01:52:47,387 --> 01:52:48,911
What do you want fr om me?

1680
01:52:50,690 --> 01:52:55,593
Mr. Kasuri, I want you to walk till the
confluence with the urn.

1681
01:52:59,699 --> 01:53:02,395
If you come, the others will take part, too.

1682
01:53:04,470 --> 01:53:05,494
Fine.

1683
01:53:06,706 --> 01:53:10,403
I'll discuss it with the committee members.

1684
01:53:12,312 --> 01:53:13,609
Will you have tea?

1685
01:53:14,280 --> 01:53:16,271
No, thank you.

1686
01:53:22,422 --> 01:53:26,483
Mr. Kasuri, have you ever thought what
would've happened..

1687
01:53:26,960 --> 01:53:30,623
..if the Muslims from Allahabad, or from all
over India..

1688
01:53:31,030 --> 01:53:33,294
..hadn't departed to Pakistan?

1689
01:53:34,167 --> 01:53:36,067
A few days ago, I was at the university.

1690
01:53:36,502 --> 01:53:39,494
I learnt that if this country wouldn't have
been divided..

1691
01:53:39,939 --> 01:53:42,237
..it would have been the most powerful
country in the world.

1692
01:53:42,942 --> 01:53:44,466
This country would have had a bigger
Muslim population..

1693
01:53:44,577 --> 01:53:47,944
..compared to any other Islamic country.
500 million.

1694
01:53:48,381 --> 01:53:50,144
And if this country was still undivided..

1695
01:53:50,250 --> 01:53:52,445
..the military expenses..

1696
01:53:52,552 --> 01:53:57,922
..that is mor e than a billion rupees could've
been saved.

1697
01:53:58,658 --> 01:54:00,990
Just think, all this money could have been
used..

1698
01:54:01,094 --> 01:54:02,561
..for education, medicines, hospitals.

1699
01:54:02,662 --> 01:54:05,392
It could have been used for such
important amenities.

1700
01:54:05,598 --> 01:54:07,725
Why are you telling me all this?

1701
01:54:09,235 --> 01:54:10,463
I know..

1702
01:54:10,570 --> 01:54:12,470
..your family wealth was plundered in
Loknath..

1703
01:54:12,572 --> 01:54:15,234
..at the time of partition.

1704
01:54:16,709 --> 01:54:20,805
You still regr et the fact that Hindus live
there.

1705
01:54:20,914 --> 01:54:24,941
Don't try to dig up old wounds. - No.

1706
01:54:25,051 --> 01:54:29,681
Mr. Kasuri.. I'm here to heal them.

1707
01:54:31,658 --> 01:54:37,790
I feel, not this country, but the Muslims
were divided.

1708
01:54:38,064 --> 01:54:39,429
Really.

1709
01:54:41,267 --> 01:54:43,064
Ask Mr. Jinnah..

1710
01:54:43,436 --> 01:54:46,303
..why he created Pakistan without..

1711
01:54:46,806 --> 01:54:49,138
..taking the advice of 80% of the Muslim
population?

1712
01:54:49,242 --> 01:54:51,176
Why did he do this for only 20% muslims.

1713
01:54:52,245 --> 01:54:55,908
And, more than 2 million people were
killed at the time of partition.

1714
01:54:56,716 --> 01:54:59,207
Just because the poor Muslims couldn't go
to Pakistan.

1715
01:54:59,686 --> 01:55:00,914
And how could they?

1716
01:55:01,454 --> 01:55:04,048
That means, 20% of affluent Muslims
involved in political..

1717
01:55:04,157 --> 01:55:07,888
..are responsible for the deaths of these 2
million people.

1718
01:55:09,062 --> 01:55:11,326
And who wanted Pakistan?

1719
01:55:11,764 --> 01:55:15,165
Liaqat Ali Khan? The Muslim League or Mr.
Jinnah?

1720
01:55:15,835 --> 01:55:17,325
No.

1721
01:55:18,404 --> 01:55:21,840
None of them had anything to do with
Pakistan.

1722
01:55:22,375 --> 01:55:26,175
Seems like you have done a thoroug h
resear ch. - Yes.

1723
01:55:26,713 --> 01:55:30,479
I found out, that Jinnah was fighting with
the British..

1724
01:55:30,750 --> 01:55:34,208
..so that Wajiristan doesn't become a part
of Pakistan.

1725
01:55:34,821 --> 01:55:38,154
And then, he even filed an affidavit in
court..

1726
01:55:38,257 --> 01:55:41,158
..saying that he's not a true Muslim.

1727
01:55:41,728 --> 01:55:43,992
So that his pr operty can be passed on to
his daughter and son..

1728
01:55:44,097 --> 01:55:45,257
..and it's not seized.

1729
01:55:45,965 --> 01:55:49,196
That was his love for Pakistan and Islam.

1730
01:55:50,837 --> 01:55:53,772
He plotted a political ruse under the
pr etext of religion..

1731
01:55:54,374 --> 01:55:56,740
..and we are still bearing the brunt of it.

1732
01:55:57,443 --> 01:56:00,344
We believed that Islam is in danger..

1733
01:56:00,446 --> 01:56:02,710
..and wer e ready to do or die for our cause.

1734
01:56:02,815 --> 01:56:05,181
But why didn't we use our brains?

1735
01:56:07,987 --> 01:56:12,014
And look what these slogans have done to
Pakistan.

1736
01:56:12,392 --> 01:56:15,486
It's a dreadful situation there. You know
everything.

1737
01:56:16,062 --> 01:56:19,122
At least, we I ndians are not dependent on
anyone.

1738
01:56:19,866 --> 01:56:23,029
The extremists who hampered progress in
Pakistan..

1739
01:56:23,136 --> 01:56:25,434
..are trying to do the same in India..

1740
01:56:26,139 --> 01:56:28,767
..under the pretext of Jihad they carry out
terrorist activities..

1741
01:56:29,042 --> 01:56:30,976
And what about the political powers here..

1742
01:56:31,077 --> 01:56:32,977
..who have made our life hell?

1743
01:56:33,079 --> 01:56:34,444
Aren't they at fault?

1744
01:56:34,547 --> 01:56:36,879
I am not denying that, Mr. Kasuri.

1745
01:56:37,116 --> 01:56:39,516
We are ready to talk to them as well..

1746
01:56:39,786 --> 01:56:43,347
..the hostility between the two religious
sects is not favourable.

1747
01:56:43,456 --> 01:56:44,787
It's detrimental for us.

1748
01:56:44,891 --> 01:56:48,019
The one's benefiting are Pakistan, America,
China.

1749
01:56:48,428 --> 01:56:52,888
We know. But we have to start the process
of persuading fr om our own home.

1750
01:56:53,232 --> 01:56:56,759
It sounds nice, but.. - No, it's possible.

1751
01:56:57,103 --> 01:57:01,301
5000 people were killed within 42 hours in
the Naokhali riots.

1752
01:57:01,808 --> 01:57:03,969
The police and the military turned their
backs.

1753
01:57:04,210 --> 01:57:06,337
If one man can stop the riots in 73 hours..

1754
01:57:06,446 --> 01:57:09,074
..without picking up any arms..

1755
01:57:09,282 --> 01:57:11,307
..then anything is possible in the world.

1756
01:57:11,818 --> 01:57:14,116
That was a different time altogether, Mr.
Hashmat.

1757
01:57:14,220 --> 01:57:16,882
Today, nobody needs Gandhi.

1758
01:57:16,989 --> 01:57:20,516
No, Mr. Kasuri, we do.

1759
01:57:21,327 --> 01:57:23,955
That's why I have come to you.

1760
01:57:25,164 --> 01:57:28,361
Allah doesn't always bless us by sending
his messengers.

1761
01:57:30,069 --> 01:57:34,472
It's not a coincidence. It's his gesture.

1762
01:57:35,541 --> 01:57:40,478
And years later he will pass through our
area.

1763
01:57:41,514 --> 01:57:43,209
We have to honour him.

1764
01:57:44,117 --> 01:57:46,312
He has come to unite us again.

1765
01:57:47,086 --> 01:57:48,917
And I am proud of it.

1766
01:57:49,388 --> 01:57:51,083
You're getting emotional.

1767
01:57:51,290 --> 01:57:53,053
These days the condition is very bad.

1768
01:57:53,259 --> 01:57:54,851
I don't have faith.

1769
01:57:55,461 --> 01:57:58,157
I can't forget anything, even if I want to.

1770
01:57:58,464 --> 01:58:01,627
Every time, it's the same scenario. Corpses
covered in blood.

1771
01:58:02,168 --> 01:58:04,227
They didn't even spare the women and
children.

1772
01:58:06,672 --> 01:58:10,574
We have taken our r evenge as well, Mr.
Kasuri.

1773
01:58:11,611 --> 01:58:13,943
We slaughtered them dreadfully.

1774
01:58:15,681 --> 01:58:17,342
It's written in the Hadish Sharif.

1775
01:58:17,450 --> 01:58:20,647
'Those who kill innocent will rot in hell.'

1776
01:58:23,623 --> 01:58:25,557
We have to decide..

1777
01:58:26,025 --> 01:58:29,153
..should we forget the dark past, and start
afresh..

1778
01:58:29,595 --> 01:58:33,531
..or let whatever is happening continue.

1779
02:00:02,855 --> 02:00:04,982
Einstein had said about Gand hi.

1780
02:00:05,091 --> 02:00:07,787
The future generation will never believe..

1781
02:00:07,893 --> 02:00:10,885
..that such a living man ever walked on
earth.

1782
02:00:10,997 --> 02:00:13,830
We might not have understood fully.

1783
02:00:13,933 --> 02:00:15,992
That's why we forgot about him so soon.

1784
02:00:16,102 --> 02:00:19,936
We forgot about his principles, his values
and his morals.

1785
02:00:20,039 --> 02:00:21,529
But he hasn't for gotten us.

1786
02:00:21,807 --> 02:00:25,299
He has returned. Destiny has br ought him
back..

1787
02:00:25,411 --> 02:00:28,437
..among us, for a journey..

1788
02:00:28,547 --> 02:00:31,072
..that will start from a chur ch and will pass
through temples, mosques..

1789
02:00:31,183 --> 02:00:34,152
..and gurdwaras (Sikh temple) and
culminate at the holy confluence.

1790
02:00:34,253 --> 02:00:39,213
He will teach us lessons of unity and
diversity..

1791
02:00:39,325 --> 02:00:42,021
..for which he scarificed.

1792
02:00:42,295 --> 02:00:45,560
From Allahabad, Manvendra Pratap Singh
for NDTV India.

1793
02:02:42,081 --> 02:02:44,311
Please don't be sad

1794
02:02:44,617 --> 02:02:46,346
So many people are her e to join us.

1795
02:04:46,939 --> 02:04:48,270
Hashmat, here they are.

1796
02:04:49,675 --> 02:04:51,006
Hashmat. You were right.

1797
02:04:51,443 --> 02:04:54,207
Love makes everything possible.

1798
02:05:22,775 --> 02:05:23,799
Mr. Hashmat, hello. come join us truck has
arrived

1799

''We are assured.''

''Pardon everyone's mistake.''

02:07:44,516 --> 02:07:49,044
''Pardon everyone's mistake.''

1814
02:07:49,154 --> 02:07:53,818
''Forsake all enmities.''

1815
02:07:53,926 --> 02:07:58,260
''You are the creator. We are your creation.''

Is the vehicle arriving? - Yes, it is.

1823
02:08:22,020 --> 02:08:24,352
Dilshad, take the things inside.

1824

Excuse me, sir. Please come out.

1825

Please come out. - ''Let there be smiles on

As long as there will be sun and moon.. -

''Sanskri Chants!''

1851
02:10:39,791 --> 02:10:42,123

Who says Gandhi's philosophies have
become outdated?

1873
02:12:29,334 --> 02:12:31,962
As long as humanity survives..

1874
02:12:32,070 --> 02:12:35,801
..his philosophies too will r emain alive.

1875
02:12:35,907 --> 02:12:38,239
Gandhi is like a sun whose rays keep..

1876
02:12:38,343 --> 02:12:43,576
..enlightening every dark corner.

1877
02:12:43,815 --> 02:12:46,875
The philosophies of a lonely man..

1878
02:12:46,985 --> 02:12:50,887
..have united the people of different
religions.

1879
02:12:51,089 --> 02:12:53,887
Yes, we have seen unison in two aspects.

1880
02:12:53,992 --> 02:12:57,928
One is of the rivers Ganga, Jamuna and
Saraswati.

1881
02:12:58,030 --> 02:13:00,362
And the other is the unison of all these
religions.

1882
02:13:00,465 --> 02:13:04,595
The question that arises is who are trying
to divide us?

1883
02:13:04,870 --> 02:13:07,304
We will have to find the answers to these
on our own.

1884
02:13:07,406 --> 02:13:12,275
What could it be?Separatism, extremism,
terrorism or dirty politics?

1885
02:16:16,795 --> 02:16:23,667
''He's the true Vaishnava..''

1886
02:16:23,768 --> 02:16:31,174
''Who knows and feels another's woes as
his own.''

1887
02:16:32,277 --> 02:16:38,807
''He's the true Vaishnava..''

1888
02:16:39,084 --> 02:16:46,581
''Who knows and feels another's woes as
his own.''

1889
02:16:47,792 --> 02:16:54,391
''He's the true Vaishnava..''

1890
02:16:54,499 --> 02:17:01,701
''Who knows and feels another's woes as
his own.''
