1
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:50,928
Answer the door.
- These girls are a nuisance.

2
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:53,290
They drop in right
in the middle of a work out.

3
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:56,760
You?
- Anyone by name Vayapuri here?

4
00:00:57,157 --> 00:01:00,536
Vayapuri? No, no one here
by that name.

5
00:01:01,027 --> 00:01:03,633
Is this C/4?
- Right.

6
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:07,202
Someone is insisting
that Vayapuri lives here.

7
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:11,345
Could you come and take a look?
- Who's this new kid in the block?

8
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:17,416
Why have you come here?
To steal, isn't it?

9
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:21,351
Why don't you answer him?
- I'm not lying, sir.

10
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:23,992
Vayapuri is from my village.
He had given me this address.

11
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,791
We were in the same class till
grade five. Believe me, please.

12
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:31,434
Riyaz, d'you have one Vayapuri
in your house?

13
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:34,462
Vayapuri...? No Vayapuri is here.

14
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:39,232
Decently dressed robbers have
become a fad. Throw him out.

15
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:42,306
Last week, similarly, a guy came
asking an address.

16
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:45,516
He decamped with a CD player
from Mahadevan's house.

17
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:47,579
This guy must be one of them.
C'mon, out with the truth!

18
00:01:47,974 --> 00:01:51,183
Believe me, sir.
I've just arrived in Madras.

19
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:54,519
Believe me, I'm not a thief.

20
00:01:55,982 --> 00:02:00,055
Vayapuri! Where had you been?
Look, what they're doing to me.

21
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:03,195
Vayapuri, even your name
isn't convincing them.

22
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:10,002
Mr Karthik, he's calling you Vayapuri.
Are you Vayapuri?

23
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:13,411
Yes.
- Vayapuri... awful name!

24
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:21,710
Send him upstairs. Quick!
- Are you convinced now?

25
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,213
I'm disgraced!

26
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:30,483
So your hunk's name is Vayapuri.
- That reeks of felony.

27
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:33,988
How can I trust him?
Here ends our relationship!

28
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:42,035
Staring too long will crack the
windscreen. Nataraj, get up here!

29
00:02:44,063 --> 00:02:45,064
Come fast...

30
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:51,447
Why is the dog barking with you?
- Why didn't you come right up here?

31
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:55,513
They are here, Riyaz.

32
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:57,921
This is Riyaz.

33
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:01,919
That's Wilson,
lovingly called as Wills.

34
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:06,225
He owns this spacious apartment.
- Want chicklets?

35
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:08,297
No thanks, I don't smoke cigarettes.
- Cigarettes"?

36
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:13,364
Never seen chicklets, I guess.
He's a rustic, after all.

37
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,597
Riyaz, he's Nataraj. We studied
together, back in the village.

38
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:20,273
Village? Say hamlet. In your hamlet
don't they unbotton their collars?

39
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:24,343
Please go and take some rest.
- The jet lag, of course!

40
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:27,980
Wills, call Kartik here.
- Karthik...??

41
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:32,048
Vayapuri! You're invited
for the village council meeting.

42
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:33,985
All because of you.
Go on, I'll be back.

43
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,863
You called me?
- Who is he?

44
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:42,232
My schoolmate, I told you.
- Is he going to pitch in here?

45
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:47,265
For few days. He's looking for a job.
- Now look, I'll fix a job for him.

46
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:49,972
But he can't stay here.
Look at the way he dresses.

47
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:54,107
And his looks and gait... awful!
He can't mix with us.

48
00:03:54,534 --> 00:04:01,645
No, he must stay here. Now that he
has come up with Kartik's real name...

49
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:04,882
there's still a plethora of unrevealed
mysteries that we ought to know.

50
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:08,383
What's the guy's name, Vayapuri?
- Nataraj.

51
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:12,588
That's what you call him.
What's his pet name?

52
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:16,125
Is it Underwear? Or is it Jockstrap?
- Shut up.

53
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:20,904
All right, it's all in the game.
Enter his name in the computer, Riyaz

54
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:26,037
Nataraj, you're part of us.
It's party time for you!

55
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:43,052
"Mute..."

56
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,428
Coconut juice.

57
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,434
Will you have, Vikram?
- No.

58
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:06,100
I'm also standing here, waiting
to obtain an American visa.

59
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:08,446
But you seem to be more tensed.

60
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:13,542
You want to go there to work.
But America is my ultimate desire.

61
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:44,780
Excuse me. Where can I find the owner?
- Owner...?

62
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:48,048
You mean, the managing director?
Go straight and then turn left.

63
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:48,946
O.k...

64
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:16,514
I didn't ask you to rise.
I asked, what do you want?

65
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:22,512
I've come looking for a job.
- Job...? For you? What do you know?

66
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:27,583
I paint well, sir.
These are my works.

67
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:35,533
And this, too.

68
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:57,554
What were we discussing?
Right, about your job.

69
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:02,484
Would you like to join today?
- Really, sir? Thanks sir.

70
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:07,156
I won't ever forget this favour.
- Your talent got you the job.

71
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:13,230
You don't need to thank me.
- But you gave me such a high post.

72
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:18,233
Don't be surprised.
You deserve a place even higher up.

73
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:41,932
Nataraj, can't you read him? Actually
you look so gloomy. He's asking...

74
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:46,259
if you're missing your folks.
- I came here with dreams...

75
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:49,937
of becoming an artist of excellence.
But I ended up painting the town.

76
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:58,606
Nataraj, no good telling him.
He's dumb and deaf.

77
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:11,857
Isn't this the flight?
Where are they?

78
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:29,779
Long live Arogyaswamy!

79
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:40,248
My respects, leader.

80
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:47,222
Why have you brought the hoofers?
- It's just a small welcome gesture.

81
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:52,864
Had we been the ruling party, I'd have
taken them right inside the flight.

82
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:55,472
(C'mon, party!
<i>'</i> Play!

83
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:23,696
What's that? A bouquet?
- Not for you. Where's your daughter?

84
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:36,270
Bouquet for you. You've come to
Madras for the first time. Let's go.

85
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,451
Come on.

86
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,054
Ah! I smell ladies.

87
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:58,298
Wills...?
Then is that one Gold Flake?

88
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:00,528
She is talking too much is'nt it...?
Are they street girls...?

89
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:08,541
You make this dress look good.

90
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:14,877
Nataraj, what're you doing there?
Come on here.

91
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:24,825
Our friend. Nataraj.
He paints well, is a great artist.

92
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:38,571
Let's go to my room.

93
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:03,298
One moment please.

94
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:08,869
Don't be shy girls,
consider this your home.

95
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:11,137
You're Reshma, aren't you?
- Yes.

96
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:13,272
Physics, first year, right?
- Yes.

97
00:12:13,632 --> 00:12:15,669
Avid reader, right?
- Right.

98
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:17,809
How about a swig?
- Disgusting!

99
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:21,819
I see, so you're a heavy drinker.
Okay, let's play for points.

100
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:23,317
Just a moment...

101
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:27,652
You're no casanova.
- Only ten points.

102
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:30,987
Only ten points? Fine.
How do I look now?

103
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:34,497
Makeup doesn't make you any better.
- Is it? Let me have that.

104
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:36,561
I want the glares.

105
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:39,533
How's that?
- Just made it.

106
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:44,067
What're you playing?
- He's Nataraj. Give him some points.

107
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:50,442
Sir, please stand here.
- What're you up to?

108
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:54,546
I'll tell you. Relax. You want to
know what we're playing, don't you?

109
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:59,511
When you guys see girls on the road,
you give points to each one of them.

110
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:03,588
We're doing just that.
Will you turn around?

111
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:08,464
To the right, will you?
- Good training.

112
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:11,698
Haven't you seen catwalks?
Fashion shows?

113
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:13,866
I know nothing. Spare me.

114
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:17,474
Will you remove your shin,
or shall we help you?

115
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:20,343
Oh no!
<i>- I'll</i> go and remove it myself...

116
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,880
How many points has Nataraj earned?
- 75 points.

117
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:29,684
This is not fair. Riyaz got only 60.
ls Nataraj a stud?

118
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:33,786
Relax. Three of us put together 75.
Just take the average.

119
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:36,526
Beats me.
- 25 points.

120
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:39,624
That's fail.
- That's more for his looks.

121
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:43,489
He earned 25 points
for staying with you guys.

122
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:47,700
Next time if we find him here,
it'll be our last visit here.

123
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:30,337
Where the hell is he?

124
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:35,942
Nataraj, what are you doing here?
Are you alive?

125
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:41,515
What's wrong with you?
- Just feeling low.

126
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,624
Because I didn't
introduce you to the girls?

127
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:49,392
You're right.
- You've got me wrong.

128
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:55,601
What're you staring at me?
Those girls speak fluent English.

129
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:58,638
And you can't speak a word of it.
Won't they taunt you?

130
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:02,878
Just to save you those insults
I didn't introduce you to them.

131
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:04,543
Is it?
- Really.

132
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:07,541
Would you mind if I ask something?
- Tell me.

133
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:13,787
Can you give me a few tips on
how to woo girls?

134
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,790
Bad times!
- Pardon me?

135
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:25,298
I mean, the wrist watch.
- Beats me.

136
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:29,831
You can woo girls with wrist watches.
Tell me, why do girls wear them?

137
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:34,039
To see the time.
- This is why you're a failure.

138
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:38,572
Girls wear it because they expect
handsome men like us to ask them time

139
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:41,018
I see.
- Yes. Suppose you ask the time...

140
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,380
to a girl standing at the bus-stop.
Even if she's Aishwarya Rai...

141
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,556
she'll have to tell the time, right?
- Right.

142
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:49,022
There you are. Try asking the time
for a few days. If it works...

143
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:52,885
try smiling at her. If that too works,
then board the bus that she takes.

144
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:57,631
Giggling, eh? Then, clutching the
hand support, show her your arms.

145
00:15:58,057 --> 00:16:00,037
Won't she fall for it?

146
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:03,167
That's it. You're feeling it, man!

147
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:06,843
Wills...
- You addressed me by my name? Chums?

148
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:11,044
Don't tell the guys
that you've tipped me.

149
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:14,612
Is this something worth
telling them? No way.

150
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,750
But one thing. You'll have
to take care of two things.

151
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:25,061
First: when you ask the time,
you must ask in English.

152
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:28,862
Second?
- Make sure she's wearing a watch.

153
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:44,813
Yesterday a person was traveling
on foot board, will he be alive...

154
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:47,378
If 90' clock bus comes we will know it...!

155
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:10,432
32:90.

156
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:15,041
32:90...? What's that you gave for
the time? And why did he thank you?

157
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:17,745
You think these guys really
want to know the time?

158
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:21,846
They just want some fun.
Look what it did to him.

159
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:38,468
Scoundrel! Aren't you ashamed?
It's not even fifteen minutes since...

160
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:41,805
the girls came here, and fifty of you
scums have asked them "Time please?"

161
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:46,803
Deprived lot! You come seeking girls?
Don't you see the clock fixed there?

162
00:17:57,342 --> 00:17:59,948
"Love, love, love"

163
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:03,653
"Everyone seeks love..."

164
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:07,459
"the tall ones and the shod ones..."

165
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:11,492
"the fat ones and even the slim ones"

166
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:14,831
"It is Death without Love..."

167
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:18,399
"said a great poet of yore"

168
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,893
"When love makes you happy..."

169
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:40,762
"the terrace is where you date"

170
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:44,360
"When love makes
a drunkard out of you..."

171
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:47,197
" Love Which won God "

172
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:45,690
“Tarzan used to court in the forests“

173
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:49,392
"Now we date via the internet"

174
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:56,834
"Passionate love between
Grandpa and grandma"

175
00:19:57,296 --> 00:20:00,277
"But the playboy
is a womanizer"

176
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:04,005
"Dating at the workshop,
dating at the bookshop"

177
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:07,683
"Sometimes you kiss,
sometimes you miss"

178
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:11,080
"Love is tickling, giggling,
burning, biting, agonizing"

179
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:14,609
"The baldie wants
to date a brunette"

180
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:18,088
"The convents girl
loves a college boy"

181
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:25,621
"Love is made in full speed
inside a learner's car"

182
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:29,361
"The angry-faced sir
is in love with the teacher"

183
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:32,959
"Over the local phone,
love-talk is cheap"

184
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:36,233
"Long distance?
It's costs you dear"

185
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:39,905
"Love is tasty, touchy,
flashy, precious"

186
00:22:08,927 --> 00:22:12,500
Wills, please give me
one more tip. Please.

187
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:15,007
Quiet! Don't disturb me,
I'm eating.

188
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:19,473
Give me one last tip.
- I did give you a super tip.

189
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:22,776
You bombed it.
- One last tip, please.

190
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,421
What're you looking at?

191
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:33,021
You got it. The look! Face to face!

192
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:39,095
"What I see with my eyes
oh my dear..."

193
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:43,438
Get that?
- If you look right into the eyes...

194
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:48,039
of a girl, she'll fall for you.
- Really?

195
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:49,241
Yes.

196
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:21,469
Wills!

197
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:25,141
Doctor, he's smashed.
Will he be able to walk again?

198
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:28,246
If he stands up, yes. Silly question.

199
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:30,482
Take rest, and you'll be fine.
- Who? Me?

200
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:36,488
Thank God, it's a minor injury.
Come, let's go out for a fag.

201
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:38,990
Take me along.

202
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:41,287
What is it?

203
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:45,167
Hope you didn't tell them
the reason for this disaster?

204
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:49,495
Are your exploits worth describing?
I told them that while painting...

205
00:23:49,861 --> 00:23:53,070
the framework crashed, and you fell.
Don't you mess it up.

206
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:57,810
No way. It concerns my life.
- And don't you even tell the doctor.

207
00:23:57,869 --> 00:24:01,715
The matter might go to the police.
And you'll be in the wanted list.

208
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:05,846
Come here.

209
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:12,720
Has the accident distorted my looks?

210
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,024
Then let me have another tip.

211
00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:22,531
What's keeping you there, Wills?

212
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:25,542
It was fun inside.

213
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:32,681
Our hero asks me, “Has the accident
distorted my looks?“

214
00:24:35,073 --> 00:24:39,146
You call that "looks", Riyaz? Karthik,
instead of coming to see you...

215
00:24:39,578 --> 00:24:42,752
had he seen a plastic surgeon,
he'd have turned a bit human.

216
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:48,120
Now the doctor has hung his hand
on to his neck. All of a sudden...

217
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:53,559
he asks me for another tip.
- Where did you pick him up from?

218
00:24:54,326 --> 00:25:00,538
He thinks he's a hero.
- A hero will be shamed to know that.

219
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:02,372
That's not a face
a girl would care for.

220
00:25:03,301 --> 00:25:06,373
What you will do, is fix
a mirror in his room.

221
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:09,274
Maybe that'll bring his senses back.

222
00:25:09,741 --> 00:25:11,118
Riaz you said it right...

223
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:06,700
Return of the scum! Dare you
ask a girl "Time please?"...

224
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:08,434
and I'll fix you for good.

225
00:26:15,273 --> 00:26:17,344
How rude! You could've kept quiet.

226
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:19,982
You'll find all types here.
Rude, like this one.

227
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:22,655
And unfortunate,
like those over there. Look.

228
00:26:27,485 --> 00:26:32,230
They seem educated,
rich and beautiful.

229
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:36,662
God has given them everything
but speech.

230
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:02,386
Poor girl!

231
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:06,757
Yes, market is very dull...

232
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:08,760
Uncle, where's Vikram?

233
00:28:17,295 --> 00:28:19,468
Madras is alien to me, that's why
I asked you to accompany me.

234
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:22,904
You know, I had a harrying time
finding the dance class.

235
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:28,074
I can't help it. I could've guided
you to New York's discotheques.

236
00:28:28,506 --> 00:28:32,784
I'm listening to M.J's new number.
Please leave me alone.

237
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:42,455
You're back?
How's the summer in Madras?

238
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:49,060
I couldn't find the dance class.
It's been moved elsewhere.

239
00:28:49,594 --> 00:28:50,572
I see.

240
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:56,808
D'you have a centre for the dumb
at the Central?

241
00:28:57,435 --> 00:29:03,351
Why?
-I asked a girl about the dance class

242
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:07,949
She was dumb, she made some gestures
that I couldn't figure out.

243
00:29:08,546 --> 00:29:15,486
Next, a dumb man showed me the way.
But I could understand his gestures.

244
00:29:15,553 --> 00:29:16,293
I see...

245
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:20,962
Poor guy!
- Why do you say that?

246
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:25,569
Being born mute makes life
so difficult, isn't it?

247
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:34,850
Rise.

248
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:39,379
May you excel in Bharat Natyam.

249
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:43,951
Today is your first day, so
observe the other students.

250
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:23,693
We're of the same batch.
My practice begins tomorrow.

251
00:30:24,422 --> 00:30:27,562
Are you from Stella Mary college?
- No. Let's walk on chatting.

252
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:37,078
Are you Rambha's sister?
- No.

253
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:38,609
Simran's?
- No.

254
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:40,881
Then stop swaying like them.

255
00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:51,018
I expect export quality, but they
seem to be working for exports.

256
00:30:54,819 --> 00:30:57,265
The name's Aishwarya. Crisis!

257
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,691
You called me?
- I guess I screamed.

258
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:24,458
You guys missed a super figure.
- Where?

259
00:31:31,155 --> 00:31:33,135
Where did she vanish?

260
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:54,221
Poor guy! The pain of being born dumb
shows on his face.

261
00:31:54,812 --> 00:31:57,986
How sad, a girl so pretty
is born dumb!

262
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:38,597
Look at that!
She's drawing zeros in the air!

263
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:43,368
That's her.
Look who's talking to her.

264
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,775
Who?
- The one standing in front of her.

265
00:32:46,197 --> 00:32:48,108
The guy from your village,
the painter.

266
00:32:51,002 --> 00:32:52,606
He has wooed a beauty.

267
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:19,075
You guys sniped me, didn't you?

268
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:22,138
Damn! I can't believe it!

269
00:33:23,768 --> 00:33:27,944
Modern women have no nose for looks.
She's chosen an awful one.

270
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:32,279
Are we to throw acid on our faces?
- Forget it. Call him.

271
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:37,389
He isn't listening. Call him.
- Nataraj!

272
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:42,894
You rustic!
He's walking deaf.

273
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:50,163
Look at him.
He didn't even turn to look at us.

274
00:33:50,828 --> 00:33:54,537
Just one girl gives him such airs.
If some more girls fall for him...

275
00:33:54,766 --> 00:33:56,905
he's going to ask me,
"Who are you? What's your name?"

276
00:33:57,268 --> 00:33:59,805
Forget it. He's going to
come home at night, anyway.

277
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:09,819
Who was that girl?
- Which girl?

278
00:34:10,248 --> 00:34:15,129
The one you were flirting with
in the morning.

279
00:34:15,853 --> 00:34:18,129
She...? She's my girlfriend.

280
00:34:19,023 --> 00:34:21,526
Of course, my girlfriend.
- Since how long?

281
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:25,796
Since about six months.
- But it's been just eight months...

282
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:30,946
since you came to the city...
- Can't I woo a girl in two months?

283
00:34:31,602 --> 00:34:35,812
I don't deny that, but the girl is
in the range of Chelsea Clinton...

284
00:34:36,174 --> 00:34:40,816
and you nowhere come near the range.
How come you hooked her?

285
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:43,225
Wooing is an art

286
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:49,823
I've seen her around here.
- Around here? Her?

287
00:34:51,189 --> 00:34:55,660
At the least you guys stick your nose
about some or the other college campus

288
00:34:55,793 --> 00:35:00,435
At the most, the Harington Road.
But my babe is a class apart

289
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:03,845
Nataraj, you're insulting us.
- You just can't swallow the fact...

290
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:10,153
that I'm dating a beauty, isn't it?
But don't worry, I'll ask my flame...

291
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:15,153
to introduce you to some girls of
your class. Say what? Goodnight.

292
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:17,520
I got to wake up early.
- What for?

293
00:35:17,915 --> 00:35:20,623
For a jog with her.
Bye-bye.

294
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:25,461
Just one girl, and look at
the change in him.

295
00:35:25,923 --> 00:35:30,463
Give me two days, and
I shall give you the girl's history.

296
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:44,812
Are you late today sir...
I'm a lame, please help me...

297
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:49,357
Please help me, madam.
May you be happy.

298
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:54,560
The signal is about to turn green,
and he's still begging.

299
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:59,026
Nothing will happen to him.
- Nothing? Just look at him.

300
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:04,240
Isn't that dangerous?

301
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:07,567
Why do you worry?
He'll make it.

302
00:36:14,272 --> 00:36:19,244
For two square meals, do we really
have to put our neck on the line?

303
00:36:20,077 --> 00:36:26,323
Why does such trivia upset you?
- What if someday he's knocked down?

304
00:36:27,285 --> 00:36:32,257
You'll find many more lives living
on the edge. You'll get used to it.

305
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:35,066
Poof guy!!

306
00:36:38,162 --> 00:36:43,162
Lord Rama held beautiful Site's hand...

307
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,687
Shweta, come here.

308
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:04,958
We're performing the Ramayana.
When Sita saw Lord Rama...

309
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:08,532
for the first time, a shyness took
over her. Now try shying.

310
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:13,604
Watch.

311
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:26,453
Lord Rama held Site's hand...
Wrong.

312
00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:29,115
Didn't you watch me?

313
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:36,890
I don't know how to feel shy.
- Shyness comes naturally to a woman.

314
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:42,236
Don't you feel shy on seeing a man?
- Why should I?

315
00:37:43,361 --> 00:37:48,333
You still have to know more about
our culture. See me after the class.

316
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:59,521
Your steps and movements are good
but you're almost expressionless.

317
00:38:00,077 --> 00:38:05,356
Put more emphasis on expressions.
- How do I master expressions?

318
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,726
To begin with, stop talking.

319
00:38:09,186 --> 00:38:14,363
Use your head, eyes, arms and
legs for expressing something.

320
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:22,640
Like the mutes. They can't speak but
they use signs to express everything.

321
00:38:27,605 --> 00:38:30,279
You can do it. I bet you'll
become a great danseuse.

322
00:38:40,351 --> 00:38:43,127
The name is Shweta.
Nice name.

323
00:38:43,554 --> 00:38:46,694
Born and brought up in Boston city,
America.

324
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:49,670
Her parents are professors
in Pennsylvania University.

325
00:38:51,429 --> 00:38:56,401
This January, for the first time
she came to India.

326
00:38:57,702 --> 00:39:01,013
Right away she went to Mahabalipuram
and scanned all the sculptures.

327
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:06,081
Bharat Natyam fascinated her,
so she joined a dance class.

328
00:39:06,444 --> 00:39:10,415
Till she learns it, she'll be staying
at her distant uncle Manikavel's house.

329
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:14,986
Right. That you've been carrying on
with her since last six months...

330
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:20,256
was a nice cock-and-bull.
Look boy, at just one glance...

331
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:25,104
we can tell a girl, whether she
can be just a friend, or more.

332
00:39:26,597 --> 00:39:29,168
Well, you can clear your doubts
with us anytime.

333
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:32,776
You think this skill
just walked on to us? Wrong.

334
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:39,155
It came after stalking countless
girls, peeping in and peeping out.

335
00:39:39,577 --> 00:39:44,026
Ask him to stay away from her.
- Now look, you couldn't...

336
00:39:44,482 --> 00:39:49,727
make friends with a beauty like
Shweta, so don't you try to malign her

337
00:39:50,254 --> 00:39:56,034
We're maligning her? What do you know
about her? You think she's dumb?

338
00:39:56,494 --> 00:40:01,910
She can make you and your daddy dumb.
She has a silver tongue. You know?

339
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:13,811
She's isn't a fraud like you think.
- I'll show you. Come on.

340
00:40:17,114 --> 00:40:20,186
I need to make an international call.
- 2nd cabin.

341
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,305
Dumbstruck, are you Nataraj?

342
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:38,002
Heard her voice? Want to hear her
talk to her international boyfriend?

343
00:40:38,636 --> 00:40:43,312
Put the lady's line here, sweetheart.
- In the 4th cabin.

344
00:40:43,707 --> 00:40:46,517
Go on, you fool.

345
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:50,615
Go. He tried to give us a shock.

346
00:40:55,553 --> 00:41:01,526
I'm all right here, but I can't
understand the guys here.

347
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:03,868
Why?
- If you smile at them...

348
00:41:04,228 --> 00:41:09,007
they hand you a love-letter, pronto.
I'm apprehensive of making friends.

349
00:41:09,567 --> 00:41:11,808
But there's some consolation, Daddy.
- What is that?

350
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:15,682
A few days back,
I met a man called Nataraj.

351
00:41:16,273 --> 00:41:21,245
He's so sweet and interesting.
I passed an hour or so with him.

352
00:41:21,712 --> 00:41:24,556
I liked him.
- Careful. This one too...

353
00:41:24,915 --> 00:41:30,297
might hand you a letter and propose.
- Even if he loves me he can't say so

354
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:34,565
Why?
- Poor guy, he's mute.

355
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:40,673
Look, he's dumbstruck!
- Her boyfriend must've kissed her...

356
00:41:40,931 --> 00:41:44,572
over the phone.
That must've sent him in a tizzy.

357
00:41:46,871 --> 00:41:50,284
I think I'll make friends
only with him.

358
00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:27,020
The guy is putting on airs.
- Who was she talking to?

359
00:42:27,444 --> 00:42:30,857
Patrick? Or Anderson?
- None of them. It was Ananda Raman.

360
00:42:31,315 --> 00:42:34,194
Ananda Raman? So she's got a
Hindu boyfriend in America?

361
00:42:34,652 --> 00:42:39,397
No boyfriend. It was my flame's dad.
- What was daddy saying?

362
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:45,636
Just asking if we wanted to settle
in India or America after our wedding

363
00:42:50,034 --> 00:42:53,811
What did she reply?
- That, she'll let him know...

364
00:42:54,171 --> 00:42:58,381
after discussing it with me. So
I need to talk to her now. Excuse me.

365
00:42:58,842 --> 00:43:00,822
What for?
- Make way for me.

366
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:03,988
Curse my luck!

367
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:10,198
Something in him has attracted her.
- What's in him?

368
00:43:10,321 --> 00:43:13,666
He's just a petty painter.

369
00:43:14,825 --> 00:43:18,671
Give me two more days. I'll
find out how he lured the girl.

370
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:30,010
Nats, you look torn.
What's the matter?

371
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:35,254
Shanmugam, didn't I tell you about
the mute girl? She isn't mute but.

372
00:43:35,713 --> 00:43:39,024
She thinks I am dumb.
- So what? Whoever she is...

373
00:43:39,383 --> 00:43:43,354
why are you concerned?
- I'm not worried about her.

374
00:43:43,721 --> 00:43:46,998
Then?
- I'm scared of my roommates.

375
00:43:47,424 --> 00:43:49,927
What?
- They keep pulling my leg.

376
00:43:50,327 --> 00:43:53,968
Just to teach them a lesson,
I lied to them that she's my flame.

377
00:43:54,431 --> 00:43:57,776
If they find out the truth,
they're going to make me pay for it.

378
00:44:03,907 --> 00:44:05,545
Me...?
- No, he.

379
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:07,250
He?
- Yes.

380
00:44:17,755 --> 00:44:21,999
She's the one I was talking about.
She takes me for a mute.

381
00:44:22,092 --> 00:44:26,131
How am I going to talk to her?
- Don't worry. Let her come up here.

382
00:44:26,563 --> 00:44:30,568
Just keep playing dumb.
- What if something goes wrong?

383
00:44:31,101 --> 00:44:35,072
If you want her to consider you
as a friend, just do as I say.

384
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:14,584
All the while these two guys kill me
with their sign language.

385
00:45:14,978 --> 00:45:20,792
And now you, too? As for Nataraj,
he's dumb, but he isn't deaf.

386
00:45:30,527 --> 00:45:35,601
Your workplace is interesting.
Do you work everyday at such heights?

387
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:40,205
Interesting. I take this road
to my dance class.

388
00:45:40,337 --> 00:45:43,477
I practice for an hour in the morning
as well as in the evening.

389
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:46,817
In the interim, I'm bored to death.

390
00:45:48,545 --> 00:45:52,687
If you don't mind, can I come here
and pass my time?

391
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:57,827
Say yes.

392
00:46:00,023 --> 00:46:01,969
I won't disturb you.

393
00:47:14,765 --> 00:47:16,745
Licence please?
- I forgot.

394
00:47:16,934 --> 00:47:19,175
No license? What's the
vehicle number? Yes, what is it?

395
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:24,243
Mute, are you?
Go on.

396
00:47:30,447 --> 00:47:35,419
Where are we headed? The suspense <i>is</i>
killing me. Where are you taking me?

397
00:47:39,056 --> 00:47:40,729
This is where you studied?

398
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:52,172
Let's go.

399
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:12,830
Vikram, all your friends including
my son have settled in America?

400
00:48:13,357 --> 00:48:15,030
What about you?

401
00:48:17,494 --> 00:48:19,235
Quiet Mom.

402
00:48:19,763 --> 00:48:21,640
Come on.
- Why did you have to, Mother?

403
00:48:22,332 --> 00:48:25,779
Vikram, why did you gift me the Statue
of Liberty? Now that I'm going...

404
00:48:26,136 --> 00:48:29,447
to America, I'll see it myself.
Keep this with you...

405
00:48:29,806 --> 00:48:33,720
keep looking at it everyday, and let
your desire to go to America swell.

406
00:48:34,177 --> 00:48:38,990
You must keep it. These days it's
tough getting an American visa.

407
00:48:40,017 --> 00:48:42,998
I got a distinction, yet I found
it tough. You know that.

408
00:48:44,121 --> 00:48:47,694
But you have a easier way out.

409
00:48:48,825 --> 00:48:53,137
In fact, you got a way that'll
make you a citizen of America.

410
00:48:55,966 --> 00:48:59,675
Shweta. She's your Visa to America.

411
00:49:00,203 --> 00:49:04,151
Marry her, and your dreams,
your goals will all be at your feet.

412
00:49:05,375 --> 00:49:08,720
She's a live Statue of Liberty.
The closer you step towards it...

413
00:49:09,046 --> 00:49:11,356
the closer you will be
getting to America.

414
00:49:26,063 --> 00:49:30,034
Nataraj, suppose you love me...
just assume it.

415
00:49:30,434 --> 00:49:32,880
How will you propose
your love to me?

416
00:49:34,071 --> 00:49:36,051
Look at him blushing.

417
00:49:41,078 --> 00:49:42,250
Answer me.

418
00:49:48,251 --> 00:49:51,130
Forget the flower,
just express that you love me.

419
00:50:02,432 --> 00:50:07,313
Won't you act like Kamal Hasan
when he played a dumb?

420
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:16,955
Why d'you act so cheap? You're well
aware that he can't talk like us.

421
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:19,088
Then why do you misbehave with him?

422
00:50:20,417 --> 00:50:22,294
Nataraj, please give me five minutes.

423
00:50:25,789 --> 00:50:31,102
Be human. D'you take him for
a zoo animal to make fun of?

424
00:50:31,928 --> 00:50:34,408
If you can't pass your time,
find some other kind of amusement.

425
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:38,369
Don't you brag too much. Haven't you
picked him up to pass your time?

426
00:50:38,835 --> 00:50:42,510
You're no Mother Theresa, are you?
Get lost.

427
00:50:48,845 --> 00:50:50,825
Nataraj, are you busy tomorrow?

428
00:50:52,482 --> 00:50:55,691
Tomorrow is Saturday. Don't you have
to go the Ad agencies for orders?

429
00:50:57,154 --> 00:50:59,930
Then why did you nod negatively?
You'll wait for me tomorrow...

430
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:03,134
at your office,
I'll be there at 4:30.

431
00:51:06,196 --> 00:51:12,306
By tomorrow evening, I want the
Star Music and Citi Bank ads painted.

432
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:17,516
Brush-and-board!
I'm tired of this life.

433
00:51:17,974 --> 00:51:18,952
God knows when I'll get a change!

434
00:51:23,447 --> 00:51:25,950
Nataraj? Hold on.

435
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:28,888
Nataraj, call for you.

436
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:33,833
Who's speaking? Nataraj here.

437
00:51:34,191 --> 00:51:39,971
It's Riyaz here. The company
has provided me a new car.

438
00:51:40,497 --> 00:51:43,740
I'm taking my girlfriend for a movie.
Why don't you join us?

439
00:51:44,968 --> 00:51:46,504
With Shweta.

440
00:51:49,906 --> 00:51:51,579
No, she won't come.

441
00:51:52,209 --> 00:51:57,181
Titanic is a superb movie.
Just join us.

442
00:51:58,215 --> 00:52:01,856
Also you'll introduce me to Shweta.
Please Nataraj you must come.

443
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:08,062
This is where you're wrong, Riyaz.
My girlfriend is different.

444
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:11,872
You think she's cheap like your
girlfriends, who go on wandering...

445
00:52:12,229 --> 00:52:16,006
about cinemas and beaches?
My girlfriend is a class apart

446
00:52:26,943 --> 00:52:29,924
Know what the time is? We're
already late. Come on, let's go.

447
00:52:31,114 --> 00:52:33,993
Nataraj, what do I tell the boss?
How can you just go away?

448
00:52:46,263 --> 00:52:49,244
What's wrong with you?
Why did you yell as if you were dumb?

449
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:51,670
I'm not Nataraj,
I'm an attender here.

450
00:52:52,068 --> 00:52:53,570
Where's Nataraj?

451
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:55,984
A while ago he was okay. Then a girl
came over, and all of a sudden...

452
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:58,717
he began acting like a dumb.
Then he left with the girl.

453
00:53:00,877 --> 00:53:04,415
What"? On seeing a girl
he started acting dumb?

454
00:53:06,983 --> 00:53:10,055
Was the girl fair?
- Yes sir.

455
00:53:10,487 --> 00:53:12,524
Tall?
- Yes.

456
00:53:12,989 --> 00:53:15,367
Clad in jeans?
- You got it, sir.

457
00:53:17,994 --> 00:53:19,996
Boy, you're finished!

458
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:29,206
Dr.Surya Prakash.
ENT specialist.

459
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:37,153
So you say it's been eight years
since you lost your speech?

460
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:42,390
Doctor, will he be able
to talk again?

461
00:53:43,653 --> 00:53:44,461
Come and sit here...

462
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:54,968
Open your mouth.

463
00:54:03,607 --> 00:54:04,847
Don't be scared.

464
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:17,489
Beats me. I'll try the X-ray.

465
00:54:33,703 --> 00:54:34,909
Let's try scanning.

466
00:54:37,374 --> 00:54:40,355
The patient's scan report,
Dr.Surya Prakash.

467
00:54:40,644 --> 00:54:45,059
Cerebrum, vocal cord, all normal.
The report is positive.

468
00:54:45,849 --> 00:54:47,760
You will decide the course.

469
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:50,856
Shock treatment.

470
00:54:59,396 --> 00:55:00,374
Relax.

471
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:05,512
All okay, but he's speechless.

472
00:55:06,536 --> 00:55:09,642
Never in my medical career
have I come across such a case.

473
00:55:14,177 --> 00:55:17,590
Let's try Speech Therapy.
- What's that, doctor?

474
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:20,389
Speech Therapy is a simple exercise.

475
00:55:20,917 --> 00:55:24,956
It's an effort to release
the voice that's subdued.

476
00:55:25,855 --> 00:55:29,632
Teach him small words and ask him
to repeat them over and over again.

477
00:55:31,428 --> 00:55:34,204
Take him out to some peaceful place,
someplace faraway.

478
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:11,111
Watch me and repeat what I say.

479
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:15,281
Say rose.

480
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:19,012
Fine. Say sky.

481
00:56:22,312 --> 00:56:24,349
Now repeat what I said.

482
00:56:24,748 --> 00:56:25,920
Sing.

483
00:56:28,251 --> 00:56:29,286
You got it.

484
00:56:29,619 --> 00:56:35,763
"Say it with me...
come on, let your head out"

485
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:46,112
"Even if you say nothing at all,
God still hears you"

486
00:56:46,503 --> 00:56:49,484
"Yet, there's a lot more
hidden in your head"

487
00:57:00,016 --> 00:57:03,190
"No matter even if you stutter,
say it all you can..."

488
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:06,296
"Say half what you can say
I'll say the rest..."

489
00:57:06,856 --> 00:57:12,932
"Say it with me...
come on, let your head out"

490
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:59,547
"Even the moon emerges full
from the crescent in few weeks"

491
00:58:01,177 --> 00:58:03,953
"You know the language,
you have the desire..."

492
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:06,360
"oh, why're you
still speechless?"

493
00:58:07,884 --> 00:58:12,958
"isn't there a sweetness
in the speech of a child?"

494
00:58:14,691 --> 00:58:19,834
"Can't the mother understand the
meaningless gurgling of her baby?"

495
00:58:24,734 --> 00:58:31,015
"So what if you've lost your speech?
You aren't a child to sit and cry"

496
00:58:48,491 --> 00:58:53,941
"Though with a flickering smile,
the lamp still faces the storm"

497
00:58:55,131 --> 00:59:00,171
"Though buried under the soil,
don't the seeds reap?"

498
00:59:01,804 --> 00:59:07,618
"Shed your shyness, and
words will easily flow"

499
00:59:08,745 --> 00:59:14,423
"Open your mouth, try to speak,
and you will speak for sure"

500
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:21,864
"Stop feeling sorry, and keep
practicing..."

501
00:59:22,292 --> 00:59:25,296
"someday your voice
will rent the skies"

502
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:27,374
"Sing it"

503
01:00:29,525 --> 01:00:31,402
Wait Nataraj, we'll drop you.

504
01:00:31,728 --> 01:00:33,799
We'll drop you near your house.

505
01:00:37,934 --> 01:00:39,470
Great man!

506
01:01:25,114 --> 01:01:28,891
Uncle, they want you.
- Who wants me?

507
01:01:29,786 --> 01:01:33,495
And why?
- Because you can speak.

508
01:02:06,255 --> 01:02:11,864
Don't you feel like a beggar?
Acting dumb for befriending a girl?

509
01:02:12,028 --> 01:02:13,006
Don't you feel ashamed?

510
01:02:14,997 --> 01:02:18,501
Such vanity! What did you tell us
the other day? That...

511
01:02:18,835 --> 01:02:22,544
you were going jogging with her, no?
But you can't even walk properly.

512
01:02:22,972 --> 01:02:27,216
It's now clear that
you conned to hook the girl.

513
01:02:27,844 --> 01:02:31,917
You said that, when it comes to girls
we are cheap, didn't you?

514
01:02:32,348 --> 01:02:37,161
We know how cheap we can get to break
your friendship. Let's go guys.

515
01:02:39,689 --> 01:02:40,827
One minute...

516
01:02:42,859 --> 01:02:46,500
Like you guys, I don't have a
great personality and a shapely body.

517
01:02:47,363 --> 01:02:51,834
Though God gave us different bodies,
He gave us the same sentiments.

518
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:55,811
From loving nature
to befriending women...

519
01:02:55,972 --> 01:03:00,079
all that you desire for,
even I desire.

520
01:03:01,944 --> 01:03:05,551
I don't get along with girls,
because people like you...

521
01:03:05,748 --> 01:03:08,251
instilled in me
an inferiority complex.

522
01:03:09,919 --> 01:03:14,095
I've been in this city for months,
yet even today...

523
01:03:14,423 --> 01:03:17,029
if someone screams "Gorilla",
I tend to look at that person.

524
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:23,436
Because, from my brother to my school
teacher, everyone called me Gorilla.

525
01:03:26,335 --> 01:03:32,251
Friends used to take me along for
wooing girls. It made me happy.

526
01:03:32,408 --> 01:03:37,551
Slowly, I realised that they used me
to show off themselves as handsome.

527
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:44,563
Although people around me instilled
an inferiority complex in me...

528
01:03:44,921 --> 01:03:49,063
I kept one hope alive... love.

529
01:03:49,792 --> 01:03:53,137
I could never envisage
a life without love.

530
01:03:53,696 --> 01:03:56,768
I don't much believe
in love after wedding.

531
01:03:57,166 --> 01:04:01,512
Because it is a must-do for
a married girl to love her husband.

532
01:04:01,938 --> 01:04:05,476
Besides, I'm ugly,
who will love me truly?

533
01:04:05,942 --> 01:04:10,015
So I decided to marry only after
making a girl fall in love with me.

534
01:04:11,414 --> 01:04:17,797
In the meantime, I met Shweta.
I found happiness in her company.

535
01:04:18,955 --> 01:04:23,700
I didn't want to lose her. Even during
the speech therapy, I thought...

536
01:04:24,093 --> 01:04:28,872
of giving up the acting, but I was
scared that I might gradually...

537
01:04:29,265 --> 01:04:33,236
lose her and her sympathies, which
is why I'm still playing dumb to her.

538
01:04:35,504 --> 01:04:40,647
No one can give me the happiness
that I get while playing dumb to her.

539
01:04:41,677 --> 01:04:49,061
The happiness is temporary. But for
a gorilla who scores only 25 points...

540
01:04:49,218 --> 01:04:49,958
the feeling is infinite.

541
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:53,963
If you wish to ruin this happiness
of mine, you may go ahead.

542
01:05:19,015 --> 01:05:23,225
You're going to the dance class empty
stomach. Why don't you have milk?

543
01:05:23,719 --> 01:05:27,997
I can't leave without my scooter keys?
- You kept the keys in the key-stand.

544
01:05:28,724 --> 01:05:31,568
Yes, but I can't find it now.

545
01:05:32,028 --> 01:05:36,340
Don't fret, Vikram is going out.
Ask him to drop you.

546
01:05:37,033 --> 01:05:40,776
But he hates Indian dances.
He's not going to drop me.

547
01:05:40,970 --> 01:05:43,814
Won't he obey me?
Drink the milk.

548
01:05:51,047 --> 01:05:53,084
Yes?
- Drop Shweta at her dance class.

549
01:05:56,686 --> 01:05:58,757
Drive carefully.
- Right Mom.

550
01:06:35,091 --> 01:06:36,399
There's Vikram.

551
01:06:38,861 --> 01:06:40,568
Coke for everyone.

552
01:06:41,197 --> 01:06:45,145
Don't sit. Miss America was sitting
there. Don't ruin that feel please.

553
01:06:45,568 --> 01:06:48,310
What're you rambling?
- I swear.

554
01:06:48,804 --> 01:06:51,876
How come?
- She lost her scooter keys.

555
01:06:52,341 --> 01:06:54,321
So I gave her a lift.
And you know what...

556
01:06:55,911 --> 01:06:58,084
she won't get the keys
for another week.

557
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:14,332
I looked for you everywhere.
What are you doing here?

558
01:07:16,932 --> 01:07:18,741
Your shoe, sir. Try it.

559
01:07:19,135 --> 01:07:21,775
Hello madam. How are you?
- Fine.

560
01:07:22,204 --> 01:07:25,674
We're going to Kishkinda.
Are you coming?

561
01:07:31,313 --> 01:07:32,291
No sir.

562
01:07:33,849 --> 01:07:37,729
No sir, I won't take it
since you're the lady's friend.

563
01:07:39,155 --> 01:07:44,298
Although I was a cripple, I used to
beg in the middle of the roads...

564
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:46,130
without caring for my own life.
And not one man cared for me.

565
01:07:46,629 --> 01:07:50,805
If someone did, they couldn't bear
with me for long and dumped me.

566
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:56,845
But this lady understood my problems,
she gave me money to set up shop.

567
01:07:57,339 --> 01:08:00,718
She helped me to live happily
with my family.

568
01:08:01,877 --> 01:08:06,223
You're her friend, sir, how can
I take money from you? I don't want.

569
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:12,490
Bye.
- Bye madam.

570
01:08:42,918 --> 01:08:45,524
Hang on Shweta, I'll buy the tickets.
- No, I'll buy.

571
01:08:45,921 --> 01:08:46,899
Hang on.

572
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:50,201
No need, let me buy it.

573
01:08:54,230 --> 01:08:59,578
I told you, I'll buy.
- My boyfriend would've paid for it.

574
01:09:00,102 --> 01:09:02,207
You think we don't know that scrooge?

575
01:09:10,045 --> 01:09:12,719
Thank God the cobbler
spared me the five bucks.

576
01:09:16,318 --> 01:09:18,491
You deserve this.
Not a cent in your pocket...

577
01:09:18,954 --> 01:09:22,367
and you go running with a wide grin
when girls call out to you, eh?

578
01:09:22,791 --> 01:09:24,634
Now you feel sorry for it?

579
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:27,904
Those girls are rich,
they play with money.

580
01:09:28,264 --> 01:09:31,404
And you got a hole in your pocket.
Isn't that humiliating?

581
01:09:37,273 --> 01:09:39,253
Could he be a friend of Shweta's?

582
01:09:45,281 --> 01:09:49,787
Nataraj, keep this. You're going
to spend for all of them.

583
01:10:57,453 --> 01:10:59,330
"Sweetheart come to me..."

584
01:11:00,356 --> 01:11:02,461
"I have grown wings"

585
01:11:03,359 --> 01:11:05,339
"Come my third day's moon..."

586
01:11:06,228 --> 01:11:08,208
"let's touch the moon"

587
01:11:08,697 --> 01:11:11,007
"For the first time... In my head"

588
01:11:11,433 --> 01:11:13,879
"I see your face"

589
01:11:14,370 --> 01:11:19,115
"I can hear her singing within me"

590
01:11:20,075 --> 01:11:25,024
"I'm free, I believe I can fly"

591
01:11:25,481 --> 01:11:28,519
"I believe I can soar"

592
01:11:44,466 --> 01:11:48,380
Shut up!
- You're drunk! Don't hit me, let go!

593
01:11:49,405 --> 01:11:51,180
Let me go!

594
01:11:56,211 --> 01:12:01,388
A stranger helped you set up shop,
but you ruined that, too. Sinner!

595
01:12:11,427 --> 01:12:15,398
Running away, are you?
- Spare my arm!

596
01:12:33,449 --> 01:12:35,224
How dare you!

597
01:12:36,452 --> 01:12:39,626
I won't spare you!
Just watch what I do to you.

598
01:12:41,457 --> 01:12:42,595
Cur!

599
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:49,500
Let him go. He's my husband, he can
hit me. Who are you to interfere?

600
01:12:50,933 --> 01:12:54,039
All these days he
has been conning me.

601
01:12:54,470 --> 01:12:57,041
I'm not taking it out on him
for hitting you, mind it!

602
01:12:57,473 --> 01:12:58,850
Come on!

603
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:12,054
Sign.

604
01:13:21,130 --> 01:13:22,108
Let's go.

605
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:26,873
How can they do like that?

606
01:13:28,270 --> 01:13:31,774
How can they just
betray someone's trust?

607
01:13:33,509 --> 01:13:36,683
I hate such people!

608
01:13:40,249 --> 01:13:42,251
Damn! It feels like...!

609
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:46,158
See you tomorrow.

610
01:14:06,775 --> 01:14:09,517
She couldn't stand a beggar's
betrayal. You know what'll happen...

611
01:14:09,878 --> 01:14:12,518
if she finds out that
you've been fooling her?

612
01:14:14,416 --> 01:14:21,026
Look, it'd have been different if
you were just flirting, like us.

613
01:14:21,557 --> 01:14:26,438
But if you're truly in love with her,
you'll have to tell her the truth.

614
01:14:26,829 --> 01:14:30,538
Come on Riyaz, she thinks he's dumb,
that's why she sticks around with him

615
01:14:30,899 --> 01:14:33,675
Won't she back off if she finds out
the truth? And he fears losing her.

616
01:14:34,069 --> 01:14:37,312
Don't be silly, Wills. Someday
she'll find out the truth.

617
01:14:37,706 --> 01:14:40,346
That day he'll be worse off.
It's better to tell her now.

618
01:14:40,776 --> 01:14:42,756
Think practically, Nataraj.

619
01:14:45,647 --> 01:14:49,561
Whatever, but telling her the truth
will put him in bad light.

620
01:14:50,185 --> 01:14:53,894
What's the way out?
Nataraj, I got an idea.

621
01:14:54,389 --> 01:14:58,804
Try telling her a small lie.
Let's see how she reacts to it.

622
01:14:59,194 --> 01:15:03,870
Her reaction will tell if you must
tell her the truth or not. What do you say?

623
01:15:08,604 --> 01:15:10,584
Nataraj, what's wrong with you?

624
01:15:13,308 --> 01:15:15,083
Why do you look so lost?

625
01:15:17,613 --> 01:15:19,092
What's that?

626
01:15:29,358 --> 01:15:31,599
"I have lied to you..."

627
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:42,213
What have you lied to me?
Tell me, what lie have you told me?

628
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:50,215
"I never studied in an an college,
nor am I a gold medalist."

629
01:16:22,811 --> 01:16:25,655
Will you leave me alone
for sometime? Please.

630
01:16:49,705 --> 01:16:53,676
Okay, now that circumstance permits
me, I must tell you something too.

631
01:16:55,577 --> 01:16:59,821
I'm selfish. I had a reason
to be in your company.

632
01:17:00,716 --> 01:17:05,028
My dance teacher told me that
if I have to learn expressions...

633
01:17:05,454 --> 01:17:08,867
I'll have to mingle with dumb fellows
like you. That's why...

634
01:17:09,224 --> 01:17:11,397
I've been in your company
all these days.

635
01:17:13,895 --> 01:17:17,866
I'm no true friend of yours,
as you consider me to be.

636
01:17:48,964 --> 01:17:51,911
What I told you a while ago,
is all a lie.

637
01:17:54,870 --> 01:18:00,411
I couldn't live a lie for even
five minutes. How could you, Nataraj?

638
01:18:00,776 --> 01:18:05,316
Well, in the beginning you lied,
to befriend me.

639
01:18:05,781 --> 01:18:10,161
But later, didn't you ever feel bad
about lying to me?

640
01:18:12,988 --> 01:18:16,094
Nataraj, have you ever considered
someone your friend wholeheartedly?

641
01:18:16,792 --> 01:18:20,262
Had you, then you must surely
understand what I'm going through.

642
01:18:22,964 --> 01:18:26,844
You cannot lie to a person
whom you truly love.

643
01:18:27,502 --> 01:18:31,473
If you can lie,
then your love isn't true.

644
01:18:36,812 --> 01:18:40,282
Let's absolve ourselves
from all lies.

645
01:18:40,816 --> 01:18:45,526
Please Nataraj,
never lie to me again.

646
01:18:48,190 --> 01:18:50,796
Say that you won't lie.

647
01:18:55,564 --> 01:18:57,874
Say the truth.
You won't lie to me, will you?

648
01:19:20,722 --> 01:19:22,963
Curse the rains! Bad timing.

649
01:19:25,494 --> 01:19:26,871
I get irritated when it rains...

650
01:19:27,329 --> 01:19:32,176
Mom, where's Shweta?
- Usually she chats for an hour...

651
01:19:32,534 --> 01:19:36,175
with Nataraj after her dance class.
Besides, it's raining this evening.

652
01:19:36,605 --> 01:19:38,846
What's the big deal?
- Silly question.

653
01:20:29,658 --> 01:20:31,968
Why're you getting drenched?
- Why? Shouldn't I?

654
01:20:35,730 --> 01:20:40,372
So, you like the rains?
- Silly, who hates the rains?

655
01:20:42,671 --> 01:20:43,911
Fun, isn't it?

656
01:20:45,941 --> 01:20:50,048
It feels great to bathe in the rains
in a tropical country like India.

657
01:20:50,512 --> 01:20:55,723
Besides, I'm happy to know that
you like the rains too.

658
01:20:56,151 --> 01:20:57,129
Same here.

659
01:20:59,955 --> 01:21:01,491
Let's drench together.

660
01:21:15,770 --> 01:21:19,343
You cannot lie to a person
whom you truly love.

661
01:21:19,975 --> 01:21:24,082
If you can lie,
then your love isn't true.

662
01:22:07,022 --> 01:22:08,524
Is Shweta in?

663
01:22:10,025 --> 01:22:13,336
I'm Nataraj here.
- Nataraj...? Who?

664
01:22:14,029 --> 01:22:16,805
Shweta's friend.

665
01:22:20,835 --> 01:22:23,247
Nataraj, are you really talking?

666
01:22:24,105 --> 01:22:27,018
I'll call Shweta.
Hold on, Mr.Nataraj.

667
01:22:33,481 --> 01:22:35,483
Nataraj calling.
- What...?

668
01:22:36,051 --> 01:22:39,828
Some flirt He's using Nataraj's name
to talk to you. Fix him.

669
01:22:49,064 --> 01:22:51,044
Speak on. It's Shweta here.

670
01:22:51,833 --> 01:22:53,779
Shweta, it's me. Nataraj.

671
01:22:57,238 --> 01:23:01,709
Who Nataraj?
- Nataraj, your friend.

672
01:23:03,144 --> 01:23:06,648
You want to talk to me, don't you?
Just come over to my house.

673
01:23:07,082 --> 01:23:09,653
I won't shy away and hide
like the other girls.

674
01:23:10,085 --> 01:23:12,861
I can talk for hours if you want,
on whatever subject you prefer.

675
01:23:13,221 --> 01:23:16,065
But don't you use Nataraj's name
to get to me. You get that?

676
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:23,800
You know who Nataraj is?
He's my best friend. He's mute.

677
01:23:27,102 --> 01:23:31,073
Don't you use Nataraj's name
to talk to me.

678
01:23:55,130 --> 01:23:58,304
I just called up Wills and
asked about you. Come

679
01:24:00,869 --> 01:24:03,782
Come right in. Know who is here?

680
01:24:04,372 --> 01:24:07,615
I thought you folks missed me and
my wife, so you flew down to India.

681
01:24:11,012 --> 01:24:13,117
Guess who he is, Daddy.

682
01:24:39,074 --> 01:24:42,078
Nataraj can hear, Daddy.
Talk to him.

683
01:24:44,212 --> 01:24:47,955
I've heard lots about you
from Shweta.

684
01:24:48,917 --> 01:24:52,160
No man is bereft of shortcomings.

685
01:24:57,192 --> 01:24:59,399
You know what happened a while ago?

686
01:25:00,095 --> 01:25:04,339
Someone called up and tried to
convince me that it was you.

687
01:25:05,133 --> 01:25:06,612
I didn't believe.

688
01:25:07,402 --> 01:25:11,350
What all lies they invent
to talk to girls.

689
01:25:13,975 --> 01:25:16,353
I answered the call.

690
01:25:18,213 --> 01:25:23,595
It was like, I could match the voice
with your personality.

691
01:25:26,387 --> 01:25:30,460
When did you come, Nataraj?
Did you meet Shweta's parents?

692
01:25:30,925 --> 01:25:33,269
Come on everyone, lunch is ready.
- Come on.

693
01:26:22,010 --> 01:26:25,822
Sorry sir, I have lied to all of you.

694
01:26:31,753 --> 01:26:36,065
Please forgive me for
committing this fraud.

695
01:26:36,724 --> 01:26:41,264
I acted dumb just to be
in the company of Shweta.

696
01:26:43,965 --> 01:26:48,505
Shweta, you said Nataraj is naive.
This doesn't speak well of him.

697
01:27:04,519 --> 01:27:08,899
We even gave you speech therapy...
you've been taking us for fools, eh?

698
01:27:11,726 --> 01:27:15,299
You're being conned. The other day it
was the beggar, now it's this rascal.

699
01:27:16,331 --> 01:27:20,040
Henceforth, know a person genuinely
before you make friends with him.

700
01:27:42,590 --> 01:27:47,562
You conned me. Traitor! Don't you
show me your face again!

701
01:27:48,096 --> 01:27:49,131
Get lost!

702
01:27:51,366 --> 01:27:56,111
Nataraj... you've been washing your
hands for too long. Come on here.

703
01:28:13,921 --> 01:28:15,264
Sit.

704
01:28:44,952 --> 01:28:47,728
Yes Shweta?
- Where's Nataraj?

705
01:28:48,156 --> 01:28:50,796
Not here as yet.
- I haven't seen him for five days.

706
01:28:51,225 --> 01:28:53,296
If he comes, ask him to come home.

707
01:28:56,964 --> 01:29:00,673
Nats, she's gone. Come on out now.

708
01:29:01,235 --> 01:29:03,146
Get on with the work.

709
01:29:20,455 --> 01:29:23,334
You're not meeting Shweta, so she's
been calling me in my office.

710
01:29:23,725 --> 01:29:25,432
What's your final decision?

711
01:29:25,793 --> 01:29:28,603
You mustn't lie to the person
whom you truly love.

712
01:29:28,996 --> 01:29:33,240
If you do, your love isn't true.
- Did the poet Kannadhasan say it?

713
01:29:33,368 --> 01:29:36,042
No, Shweta did.
- She must also be drinking.

714
01:29:36,471 --> 01:29:40,214
Quiet.
- My love for her is true, Riyaz.

715
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:45,523
But I'm also deceiving her. I'm
scared to even look into her eyes.

716
01:29:46,047 --> 01:29:49,028
Why don't you tell her the truth then?
- I can't, and at the same time...

717
01:29:49,117 --> 01:29:53,031
I can't put on this act.
I just can't bear it anymore.

718
01:29:53,488 --> 01:29:55,661
How long will this continue?
- I don't know.

719
01:30:05,199 --> 01:30:08,476
"What is love?"

720
01:30:09,771 --> 01:30:13,651
"Heads spurn heads"

721
01:30:14,208 --> 01:30:15,915
"I have fallen in love"

722
01:30:16,644 --> 01:30:18,624
"Play the drum"

723
01:30:21,382 --> 01:30:24,693
What's the Sardar saying?
- Forget him, let's begin.

724
01:30:31,692 --> 01:30:34,229
Come on, sing it.

725
01:30:35,730 --> 01:30:41,305
"Freak out at nights, get drunk,
roll over, you've got nothing to lose"

726
01:30:42,270 --> 01:30:47,777
"Try a cocktail, if it is hard,
add a little soda"

727
01:30:48,609 --> 01:30:50,782
"if you love you're sure to get dejected..."

728
01:30:51,312 --> 01:30:54,088
"if you want to get over it...
- get drunk"

729
01:30:54,615 --> 01:31:00,691
"Listen to what the preacher says...
Love is an enigmatic adventure"

730
01:31:01,055 --> 01:31:06,733
"So drink, don't waste the night,
you have nothing to lose"

731
01:31:35,590 --> 01:31:41,165
"Live your life like the wheels...
if punctured, stick it"

732
01:31:41,829 --> 01:31:47,507
"Your head can't take overload
if you fall in love you'll be sleepless..."

733
01:31:48,102 --> 01:31:50,582
"Like the lorry,
heads too have resting places"

734
01:31:51,005 --> 01:31:53,576
"All we have to do is to get it
serviced from time to time"

735
01:32:00,481 --> 01:32:03,360
"But the roadblock..."

736
01:32:06,721 --> 01:32:09,600
"The blockade spares no lorry"

737
01:32:10,124 --> 01:32:12,536
"What man is spared by women?"

738
01:32:44,659 --> 01:32:50,371
"Her eyes are atomic,
and I'm drowning like the Titanic"

739
01:32:50,865 --> 01:32:56,645
"She's as luring as chilli-chicken,
and her lips painted in alluring pink"

740
01:32:57,104 --> 01:33:02,747
"She's married three times, and
it's a secret that I'm one of them"

741
01:33:09,617 --> 01:33:12,655
“Don't be hurt...“

742
01:33:15,690 --> 01:33:18,398
"Take it easy, my friend"

743
01:33:18,893 --> 01:33:21,772
"You must make your love
a successful one"

744
01:33:22,296 --> 01:33:27,837
"Celebrate the night, get drunk,
for you've got nothing to lose"

745
01:33:28,603 --> 01:33:33,575
"Try a cocktail, if it is hard,
add a little soda"

746
01:33:34,809 --> 01:33:37,221
"Love...
- stings..."

747
01:33:37,712 --> 01:33:40,056
"if you want to get over it...
- get drunk"

748
01:33:40,948 --> 01:33:46,694
"Listen to what the preacher says...
Love is an enigmatic adventure"

749
01:33:47,388 --> 01:33:52,701
"So drink, don't waste the night,
you have nothing to lose"

750
01:34:10,544 --> 01:34:12,217
I had been to the Spencers.

751
01:34:13,748 --> 01:34:16,194
I saw this statue of Nataraj.
(God of Dance)

752
01:34:16,550 --> 01:34:19,724
It reminded me of you,
so I bought it. You like it?

753
01:34:20,454 --> 01:34:21,728
Beautiful.

754
01:34:25,559 --> 01:34:27,129
You like it?

755
01:34:28,929 --> 01:34:30,840
You don't?
- Actually...

756
01:34:31,232 --> 01:34:34,736
this statue reminds me of Nataraj.

757
01:34:36,937 --> 01:34:41,818
Been ten days since I've seen him.
No idea where he is.

758
01:34:43,477 --> 01:34:46,458
Wherever he is,
today I must find him.

759
01:35:27,688 --> 01:35:30,794
He was painting up there when he
missed his footing and fell down.

760
01:35:31,225 --> 01:35:35,139
Poor guy, he lost lots of blood.
After falling from that height...

761
01:35:35,563 --> 01:35:39,909
I don't think he's going to survive.
He has been taken to the hospital.

762
01:35:59,754 --> 01:36:00,323
"Yes madam..."

763
01:36:00,554 --> 01:36:02,625
Where's the emergency ward?
- Who do you want?

764
01:36:03,457 --> 01:36:05,903
Someone fell down from a height
and was brought here two hours ago...

765
01:36:06,794 --> 01:36:11,174
He's dead. The corpse has been
sent to the mortuary.

766
01:36:17,872 --> 01:36:20,512
A man was brought here a while ago,
he fell down

767
01:36:20,875 --> 01:36:23,856
Yes, the corpse was full
of paint and blood. Why do you ask?

768
01:36:25,613 --> 01:36:27,650
I'm asking you no?

769
01:36:28,883 --> 01:36:33,764
I need to see...
- It's a mortuary, not an museum.

770
01:36:33,921 --> 01:36:35,332
Go, get a permission from the Dean.

771
01:37:58,372 --> 01:38:00,613
Mr.Artist, I need a book.

772
01:38:01,141 --> 01:38:05,112
Stop making those sketches. Instead,
painting "No Vacancy" signboards...

773
01:38:05,546 --> 01:38:07,457
will make a millionaire out of you.

774
01:38:10,117 --> 01:38:12,290
Karthik, come here.
- What is it?

775
01:38:12,753 --> 01:38:14,528
Look what he is sketching.

776
01:38:16,090 --> 01:38:17,296
What's that?

777
01:38:18,092 --> 01:38:21,972
The other day in the liquor bar, you
said you're going to forget Shweta.

778
01:38:22,329 --> 01:38:25,173
And tonight you're
making portraits of her?

779
01:38:25,599 --> 01:38:29,638
Until yesterday there was no change
in my resolve to stop seeing Shweta.

780
01:38:30,137 --> 01:38:34,586
But today my colleague Sounder,
fell down from the framework.

781
01:38:35,009 --> 01:38:37,922
Shweta thought it was me, and came
looking for me at the hospital.

782
01:38:38,279 --> 01:38:41,783
When she found me alive, hugged me
tight and sobbed inconsolably.

783
01:38:42,716 --> 01:38:48,132
That moment, unyielding as it was
my resolve was shattered.

784
01:38:49,089 --> 01:38:51,160
After all, I'm human.

785
01:39:04,438 --> 01:39:07,908
Come home after meeting Shweta. We're
going for a movie in the evening.

786
01:39:08,075 --> 01:39:09,145
You're coming, aren't you?

787
01:39:10,044 --> 01:39:14,015
Was that nod a "yes" or "no"?
Why don't you speak?

788
01:39:14,682 --> 01:39:17,822
Buddy, once I'm out of the house,
I don't speak to anyone.

789
01:39:18,185 --> 01:39:22,634
Out here, everyone seems to be Shweta.
I can't even talk to save my life.

790
01:39:23,057 --> 01:39:27,733
So? Must you act dumb to everyone?
- You can't imagine my constraint.

791
01:39:27,962 --> 01:39:30,169
Neither will you understand
if I explain.

792
01:39:40,274 --> 01:39:48,216
"Columbus, I'm on holiday...
find a new island for my holidays..."

793
01:39:49,783 --> 01:39:51,592
Got a fag, lady?

794
01:39:52,086 --> 01:39:53,292
YOU got?

795
01:39:54,221 --> 01:39:55,825
Got a fag?

796
01:39:57,157 --> 01:39:58,864
At least a beedi?

797
01:40:00,327 --> 01:40:03,399
Can't you say no if you don't
have one? What're you staring at?

798
01:40:10,838 --> 01:40:12,749
Can you tell which brand this is?

799
01:40:13,807 --> 01:40:15,878
Sealing your nose, eh?
My! Look at your style!

800
01:40:17,277 --> 01:40:20,224
No money to buy a cigarette,
but you wear Lee jeans.

801
01:40:22,049 --> 01:40:23,687
Got the jeans in charity?

802
01:40:24,118 --> 01:40:27,429
You think you are a bigshot?
What have you got in your pocket?

803
01:40:28,122 --> 01:40:31,899
A dime...? And you think
that will help you woo a girl?

804
01:40:32,459 --> 01:40:34,632
You think I'll let you do that?
No way.

805
01:40:35,129 --> 01:40:39,339
C'mon talk!
Open your mouth and shoot!

806
01:40:39,833 --> 01:40:44,509
Look at him, guys! He doesn't talk.
He's rooted as if he's on display.

807
01:40:45,839 --> 01:40:50,185
You think your stare will scare me?
Don't you feel humiliated?

808
01:40:50,644 --> 01:40:52,851
Are you deaf?
There! You're losing your temper.

809
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:56,284
Or, are you dumb?
- You call me dumb?

810
01:40:56,650 --> 01:40:58,960
I can talk! You get that?

811
01:40:59,386 --> 01:41:01,366
Please Don't feel offended, sir.
We're from Sun Tv.

812
01:41:01,655 --> 01:41:02,827
Look there, sir.

813
01:41:03,257 --> 01:41:07,467
That's our unit. This act was
for our programme "Candid Camera".

814
01:41:07,828 --> 01:41:12,743
We just test people's patience.
Just for fun, please don't mind.

815
01:41:16,837 --> 01:41:17,941
I can talk.

816
01:41:18,372 --> 01:41:21,319
And he said, "That's enough".

817
01:41:25,179 --> 01:41:27,159
My scooter...??
I had an accident.

818
01:41:29,183 --> 01:41:30,821
I'm not hurt

819
01:41:34,221 --> 01:41:38,169
Lord Ganapati has manifested.
You will be rid of all miseries.

820
01:41:48,102 --> 01:41:52,346
My Rambha had predicted
the atomic test India conducted.

821
01:41:52,573 --> 01:41:53,779
Rambha, pick up a fortune card
for the lady.

822
01:41:53,874 --> 01:41:57,720
Later. First for him.
- For him? All right, here we go.

823
01:41:58,212 --> 01:42:03,594
Come on, Rambha. Rambha foretells
nothing but the truth.

824
01:42:04,218 --> 01:42:06,994
Rambha, pick up a favourable card
for the gentleman.

825
01:42:08,222 --> 01:42:10,202
What is the gentleman's name?
- Nataraj.

826
01:42:10,557 --> 01:42:13,003
Why? Doesn't he speak?
- He's mute.

827
01:42:18,966 --> 01:42:23,005
Did you say he is mute? But the card
shows the witty sage Narad.

828
01:42:23,470 --> 01:42:25,882
He has a silver tongue.
He lives by his tongue.

829
01:42:26,240 --> 01:42:31,383
Sage Narad was the one who set up
a fight between the gods.

830
01:42:31,778 --> 01:42:35,487
This gentleman has got
a tricky tongue.

831
01:42:35,983 --> 01:42:38,224
What is he saying?
I don't understand a thing.

832
01:42:39,153 --> 01:42:43,795
Gentleman, your fate-card says that
you've got a silver tongue.

833
01:42:44,258 --> 01:42:47,831
You want to ruin me?
Give it to me, will you?

834
01:42:48,262 --> 01:42:50,640
Lady, the gentleman can talk!

835
01:43:05,012 --> 01:43:06,423
What is it, Vikram?

836
01:43:09,983 --> 01:43:12,361
Did you have to wish me at this hour?

837
01:43:15,088 --> 01:43:18,035
Tell me, how do you know
my date of birth?

838
01:43:18,425 --> 01:43:22,066
Even my passport carries a false
date of birth. Then how...?

839
01:43:23,297 --> 01:43:27,268
If you take a liking for someone,
you get to know everything about her.

840
01:43:58,899 --> 01:44:02,312
What's the matter?
- I'm missing Nataraj.

841
01:44:05,572 --> 01:44:07,984
We invited all your friends but him.

842
01:44:09,476 --> 01:44:11,922
How did I forget?
But why didn't you invite him?

843
01:44:12,079 --> 01:44:18,325
I called up his house, office and
everywhere, but I couldn't find him.

844
01:44:19,219 --> 01:44:23,326
Unlike you he doesn't know
that today's my birthday.

845
01:44:33,233 --> 01:44:35,941
I'm elated tonight.
- Is it?

846
01:44:36,136 --> 01:44:38,912
Know why?
- Only if you tell me.

847
01:44:39,473 --> 01:44:41,350
Because I celebrated your birthday.

848
01:44:44,378 --> 01:44:47,359
Stop the car, Vikram.

849
01:44:59,393 --> 01:45:01,031
Happy birthday to you.

850
01:45:01,395 --> 01:45:05,741
If you really love someone,
set free him free.

851
01:45:05,932 --> 01:45:08,970
If he comes back to you,
then your love is true.

852
01:45:11,171 --> 01:45:15,051
Some guy has celebrated
his flame's birthday in style.

853
01:45:16,209 --> 01:45:18,189
The artist has to be Nataraj.

854
01:45:19,413 --> 01:45:24,590
Isn't Nataraj great? He can't talk,
but on your birthday...

855
01:45:24,818 --> 01:45:26,798
he has made the entire town talk.

856
01:45:32,426 --> 01:45:36,397
If you take a liking for someone,
you get to know everything about her.

857
01:45:41,134 --> 01:45:43,080
Shweta, come let's go.

858
01:45:45,138 --> 01:45:49,678
Go ahead, Vikram.
I'll come after I've seen Nataraj.

859
01:46:11,164 --> 01:46:13,701
Nataraj, many thanks
for wishing me on my birthday.

860
01:46:15,602 --> 01:46:18,776
Your friends told me that
on a full moon night...

861
01:46:19,206 --> 01:46:21,186
I can find you only in Mahabalipuram.

862
01:46:21,708 --> 01:46:28,148
On a full moon night, the temple
on the sea shore looks so magnificent

863
01:46:30,484 --> 01:46:32,623
I knew you were a great artist...

864
01:46:32,986 --> 01:46:36,866
but I never imagined you
to be such a fine poet.

865
01:46:37,657 --> 01:46:40,160
Your poem was superb, Nataraj.

866
01:46:42,496 --> 01:46:45,807
Poetry comes from the head
if you are in love, they say.

867
01:46:46,233 --> 01:46:48,144
Are you in love with someone?

868
01:47:14,528 --> 01:47:17,839
"Do not ask me questions
for which I don't have a reply"

869
01:47:18,265 --> 01:47:21,075
"Do not force me,
do not put me in a dilemma"

870
01:47:21,535 --> 01:47:28,009
"I can't find words
to describe you"

871
01:47:28,675 --> 01:47:35,820
"My life will go dumb..."

872
01:48:16,590 --> 01:48:22,632
"In dead silence I strode...
and you asked me to speak"

873
01:48:23,864 --> 01:48:29,940
"You speak the language of love,
but you won't admit"

874
01:48:31,071 --> 01:48:37,386
"When I sketch the moon,
I see you in it"

875
01:48:38,478 --> 01:48:44,360
"You're the one
who stole my head away"

876
01:48:44,851 --> 01:48:49,061
"You, my head beats for"

877
01:48:49,623 --> 01:48:51,864
"You, I breathe for"

878
01:48:52,359 --> 01:48:58,935
"Today my breath and breeze have
fallen in love..."

879
01:48:59,432 --> 01:49:02,413
"Don't ask me questions
that I can't answer"

880
01:49:02,802 --> 01:49:06,511
"Don't force me,
don't put me in a dilemma"

881
01:49:39,673 --> 01:49:45,248
"Times when you keep me waiting,
my eyes rain tears"

882
01:49:46,813 --> 01:49:52,456
"When Cupid's arrow strikes, even the
smallest distance seem shattering"

883
01:49:54,087 --> 01:49:59,867
"I've changed totally since yesterday..."

884
01:50:01,394 --> 01:50:07,140
"Build a bridge between eyes and head..."

885
01:50:08,134 --> 01:50:14,710
"Don't say a word, but your
silence says a thousand tales"

886
01:50:14,975 --> 01:50:17,819
"I don't know
what's happening to me"

887
01:50:18,178 --> 01:50:21,785
"Am I being engulfed
in the flame of love?"

888
01:50:22,382 --> 01:50:25,329
"Don't ask me,
I can't explain"

889
01:50:25,819 --> 01:50:28,698
"Do not ignore me,
do not leave me"

890
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:08,940
Do you know what time it is?

891
01:51:10,430 --> 01:51:12,410
You've come fifty-three kilometers
away from Madras.

892
01:51:12,999 --> 01:51:15,070
Couldn't you give a call home?

893
01:51:18,505 --> 01:51:22,920
As long as you are in India,
we're responsible for you.

894
01:51:25,779 --> 01:51:29,158
She is naive. Should you
have to encourage her?

895
01:51:32,519 --> 01:51:34,157
Shall we leave now?

896
01:52:17,530 --> 01:52:20,602
Nataraj, Shweta told me that
your painting job is tough.

897
01:52:20,967 --> 01:52:22,947
Will you go to Hyderabad?
My owns a company there?

898
01:52:24,838 --> 01:52:26,374
You won't go, eh?

899
01:52:30,643 --> 01:52:31,621
Goodness!

900
01:52:34,013 --> 01:52:36,152
The car broke down.
It needs a shove.

901
01:52:38,952 --> 01:52:42,161
Oh no, how can you?
I'll help you.

902
01:53:20,326 --> 01:53:21,396
My name is Natraj...

903
01:53:23,062 --> 01:53:24,439
I'm a handsome boy...

904
01:53:25,498 --> 01:53:27,034
She loves me very much...

905
01:53:28,468 --> 01:53:29,708
I'm going to College..

906
01:53:30,003 --> 01:53:32,449
That's all a lie.

907
01:53:32,906 --> 01:53:36,444
Don't you think you're
driving the English too far?

908
01:53:36,910 --> 01:53:40,881
Last night when I was with Shweta,
Vikram also came by.

909
01:53:41,247 --> 01:53:43,591
He speaks English <i>so</i> fluently,
just like an Englishman.

910
01:53:43,983 --> 01:53:46,463
So?
- I'm going to learn English.

911
01:53:46,920 --> 01:53:48,558
Then?
- I'll talk.

912
01:53:48,922 --> 01:53:51,562
So what if he can talk
English or German?

913
01:53:51,925 --> 01:53:54,132
Will you talk?
- So what if I talk...?

914
01:53:56,629 --> 01:53:57,903
Good Lord!

915
01:53:58,932 --> 01:54:00,707
Sorry, man.

916
01:54:01,167 --> 01:54:05,582
Go on, try talking. You have the gift
of the Universal tongue, after all.

917
01:54:06,005 --> 01:54:08,076
You got just one word... "Bah".

918
01:54:08,675 --> 01:54:11,588
Why does Vikram upset you?

919
01:54:12,045 --> 01:54:15,720
I think, Vikram is the
right man for Shweta.

920
01:54:16,516 --> 01:54:19,656
But my heart won't take that.

921
01:54:25,058 --> 01:54:27,197
Nataraj, it's your flame! Shweta!
- What"? Shweta?

922
01:54:28,795 --> 01:54:31,537
Why is she here?
- Who knows! You must've...

923
01:54:31,965 --> 01:54:35,936
asked her over. Are you bluffing?
- I swear I didn't. What now?

924
01:54:36,302 --> 01:54:38,282
Keep her engaged for sometime.

925
01:54:39,105 --> 01:54:42,951
Just remember... I am a dumb!

926
01:54:43,710 --> 01:54:46,589
Put the book down, will you?
- Sure... and now for her portraits!

927
01:54:46,980 --> 01:54:50,621
What if she sees this room
filled with her portraits?

928
01:54:58,691 --> 01:55:00,329
When did you arrive?
- Just now.

929
01:55:00,693 --> 01:55:03,230
We too. We didn't see you from above.
- What...?

930
01:55:03,730 --> 01:55:06,574
Come on in.
- Come in.

931
01:55:07,066 --> 01:55:10,206
Won't you move?
- You're blocking her. Go on, Shweta.

932
01:55:16,409 --> 01:55:18,116
What're you doing?

933
01:55:21,080 --> 01:55:23,321
Why didn't you come home
last evening?

934
01:55:27,020 --> 01:55:30,001
Very busy...? You could've
at least phoned me...

935
01:55:38,932 --> 01:55:45,008
Nice interior. But the walls could've
looked better with some paintings.

936
01:55:48,107 --> 01:55:51,020
I've come to your house.
Won't you offer me a cup of coffee?

937
01:56:17,870 --> 01:56:19,247
That's salt.

938
01:56:20,273 --> 01:56:21,445
Sugar is here.

939
01:56:25,778 --> 01:56:27,724
Give me the spoon, Nataraj.

940
01:56:32,385 --> 01:56:34,865
My, my! I thought you'd yell "Mother"
but you didn't lose your wits...

941
01:56:35,221 --> 01:56:37,724
you maintained your act.
Your love is a sure success.

942
01:56:38,091 --> 01:56:41,072
Shut up! I'm worried,
she might sight the portraits.

943
01:56:41,427 --> 01:56:44,408
You created something close to a tea.
Hope it doesn't strike her dumb.

944
01:57:04,183 --> 01:57:05,218
Come here.

945
01:57:10,857 --> 01:57:12,837
Why did you hide this from me?

946
01:57:14,360 --> 01:57:16,101
Why did you do this?

947
01:57:20,867 --> 01:57:23,507
You've beautifully portrayed
a rural girl in a modern light.

948
01:57:27,006 --> 01:57:31,682
And you never showed me? Never mind.
You have so many paintings here.

949
01:57:32,612 --> 01:57:34,785
Can I show them to my friends?

950
01:57:46,893 --> 01:57:50,568
You've been mixing the paint for quite
a while now. Why aren't you working?

951
01:57:50,763 --> 01:57:55,678
In a shod while India takes on
Australia. Sachin is going to blast them...

952
01:57:55,902 --> 01:57:58,212
Nataraj, arrange to watch
it on TV somewhere...

953
01:57:59,172 --> 01:58:01,709
You want to watch the match?
Then let's go to Shweta's house.

954
01:58:02,175 --> 01:58:07,386
To Shweta's house? Hey, there are
pretty girls in her locality.

955
01:58:07,980 --> 01:58:10,187
To go there I ought to
add some glamor on to me.

956
01:58:11,184 --> 01:58:12,288
Welcome.

957
01:58:13,920 --> 01:58:14,955
Sit.

958
01:58:16,189 --> 01:58:18,169
Haircut? Or a shave?
- Won't you shave the head?

959
01:58:18,524 --> 01:58:20,731
I need a haircut and a shave.
- Okay.

960
01:58:22,195 --> 01:58:25,972
Heaven is where a clean home is.

961
01:58:26,432 --> 01:58:28,969
So get me a clean towel.

962
01:58:34,240 --> 01:58:39,417
Hold it. What the hell is this?
Get me a good towel. Go.

963
01:58:50,223 --> 01:58:52,703
Zero per cent din,
Hundred per cent spotless.

964
01:58:53,226 --> 01:58:58,676
It stinks. Get me a clean one.
- It's clean, sir. Smell it...

965
01:58:58,865 --> 01:59:01,573
Don't drone about the smell. I can
smell and tell the brand of paints.

966
01:59:01,868 --> 01:59:03,245
Go and change the towel.

967
01:59:17,250 --> 01:59:22,723
Do you take me for a fool? I don't
use seconds. Get me a fresh one.

968
01:59:23,156 --> 01:59:25,363
It is fresh.
- Don't argue, just get it. Go.

969
01:59:40,273 --> 01:59:43,584
You could've given this earlier.
Please don't mind what I said.

970
01:59:43,976 --> 01:59:45,785
Never, I swear.
- Carry on.

971
01:59:46,145 --> 01:59:48,591
Won't you sniff it out?
- Ah, the brand?

972
01:59:51,284 --> 01:59:57,257
Sir! Where are you off to, sir?
You can't go away without paying me.

973
02:00:11,571 --> 02:00:13,414
Yes? Shweta?

974
02:00:15,508 --> 02:00:17,954
She isn't in. She has gone out.

975
02:00:18,811 --> 02:00:23,089
Her scooter is here.
- She has taken the car.

976
02:00:23,482 --> 02:00:25,291
Vikram, who is it?

977
02:00:29,322 --> 02:00:33,600
Welcome Nataraj.
Shweta, it's our Nataraj.

978
02:00:34,093 --> 02:00:35,766
Ask him to come in.

979
02:00:43,402 --> 02:00:45,382
That's a bad haircut.
- Beat it!

980
02:00:58,651 --> 02:01:01,393
Did he hit another boundary?
Please.

981
02:01:02,154 --> 02:01:05,135
Uncle, come fast.
Sachin is on a song.

982
02:01:14,100 --> 02:01:16,444
I'm sorry, Nataraj.
Wait, I'll clean it.

983
02:01:34,053 --> 02:01:37,500
Go on, scratch your nose.
But don't you take me for a dumb.

984
02:01:43,095 --> 02:01:45,575
Hey, Sachin is out.
That's the end of India.

985
02:01:47,400 --> 02:01:50,540
I'm switching channels.
This one's going to be a sore.

986
02:01:51,137 --> 02:01:54,380
You bet. It's all over.
Change the channel.

987
02:02:00,546 --> 02:02:03,390
Hey! Candid Camera! Nataraj,
this programme is very interesting.

988
02:02:12,992 --> 02:02:14,801
Nataraj, it's you!

989
02:02:15,428 --> 02:02:18,409
How come you made it on tv?
You never told me.

990
02:02:21,834 --> 02:02:24,405
Hang on, I'll get Aunt over here.

991
02:02:30,443 --> 02:02:32,753
Turn it off!
- She has taken the remote.

992
02:02:33,145 --> 02:02:36,217
Search the button.
- Can't find even one at the front.

993
02:02:36,615 --> 02:02:38,891
Try behind.
- All right.

994
02:02:39,452 --> 02:02:41,489
I got a shock.
You're going to kill me!

995
02:02:41,854 --> 02:02:44,858
Aunt, Nataraj is coming on tv.
- Really?

996
02:02:46,192 --> 02:02:48,433
Why don't we break the tv?
- Good idea. You break it...

997
02:02:48,794 --> 02:02:50,774
while I take a hike.
- Where are you off to?

998
02:02:51,197 --> 02:02:53,438
I'm going to be lynched today!
- I've had it.

999
02:02:54,934 --> 02:02:57,437
Nataraj, you never told us
you'll be appearing on tv.

1000
02:02:57,803 --> 02:03:01,114
All right, you don't have to go near.
Sit back and watch yourself.

1001
02:03:04,377 --> 02:03:06,857
Sit... where are you going?
- He's embarrassed.

1002
02:03:07,279 --> 02:03:09,259
What's so embarrassing?
Sit down and watch.

1003
02:03:09,648 --> 02:03:11,252
C'mon talk!

1004
02:03:27,700 --> 02:03:30,738
Why didn't you tell me
you were to appear on tv?

1005
02:03:33,239 --> 02:03:35,981
He'll tell you now.
You're going to witness it live.

1006
02:03:36,642 --> 02:03:39,885
Vikram, Nataraj is on tv.
Come and watch.

1007
02:03:45,518 --> 02:03:49,489
You let your head out on camera,
didn't you? You've had it today!

1008
02:03:50,656 --> 02:03:53,500
A power failure! Bad timing!

1009
02:04:03,269 --> 02:04:06,307
I'll call as soon as I reach Delhi.
- No letters please, okay?

1010
02:04:07,540 --> 02:04:09,781
Here's your aeroplane ticket.
- Aeroplane...?

1011
02:04:10,376 --> 02:04:13,516
Come off it.
Nataraj, I need to talk to you.

1012
02:04:15,548 --> 02:04:20,122
Look Nataraj, I'm a practical person.
And I do what speaks well of me.

1013
02:04:20,619 --> 02:04:24,066
Which is why I have sidestepped
the love stuff.

1014
02:04:24,557 --> 02:04:27,436
I hear, everyday you walk
towards Beasant Nagar.

1015
02:04:29,562 --> 02:04:31,542
I mean, to Shweta's house.

1016
02:04:32,264 --> 02:04:36,212
That's your personal matter. But the
guys told me you felt happy that...

1017
02:04:36,569 --> 02:04:40,540
she hugged you at the hospital, and
came looking for you in Mahabalipuram

1018
02:04:42,575 --> 02:04:46,045
This is how woman tempt you.
Don't take it for love.

1019
02:04:48,848 --> 02:04:51,260
Riyaz, aren't you leaving?
Why do you have to pull his leg?

1020
02:04:51,383 --> 02:04:53,954
Shut up.
- Riyaz, you're a practical person.

1021
02:04:54,386 --> 02:04:59,460
But Nataraj's theory has sense.
Would a girl hug you for no reasons?

1022
02:04:59,925 --> 02:05:03,236
Come off it, you fool! Kissing and
hugging is a common practice abroad.

1023
02:05:03,596 --> 02:05:07,169
And you forget that Shweta was
born and brought up in America.

1024
02:05:07,600 --> 02:05:09,273
You guys are misleading him.

1025
02:05:10,603 --> 02:05:13,982
D'you still love her?
- Yes.

1026
02:05:14,473 --> 02:05:17,079
Does she?
- I don't know.

1027
02:05:17,610 --> 02:05:21,922
Then pack up and come with me. I'll
get you a job in the an section...

1028
02:05:22,281 --> 02:05:24,921
of Lintas ad agency. Know what
they pay you initially? 10,000.

1029
02:05:25,317 --> 02:05:27,319
You won't have to hang in the air
and bear the heat...

1030
02:05:27,686 --> 02:05:30,599
you'll be working inside an
air-conditioned cabin. What d'you say?

1031
02:05:33,325 --> 02:05:37,171
Fine, I'll come after three months.
- Why after three months?

1032
02:05:37,630 --> 02:05:41,601
Shweta will return to America
after three months.

1033
02:05:42,635 --> 02:05:47,175
You don't know if she loves you. You
also say she's returning to America.

1034
02:05:47,640 --> 02:05:49,620
Why do you want to waste your life
for a girl?

1035
02:05:50,376 --> 02:05:55,291
The days of joy in Shweta's company
is indefinite.

1036
02:05:55,881 --> 02:05:57,861
Let me enjoy her company
for a few more days.

1037
02:06:02,521 --> 02:06:06,970
I don't even dream in my sleep
but you live in a world of dreams.

1038
02:06:07,359 --> 02:06:10,431
At this point of time you won't
understand what I mean. Bye, see you.

1039
02:06:12,731 --> 02:06:16,645
Riyaz, now that you're leaving,
shall I occupy your room?

1040
02:06:18,671 --> 02:06:20,150
My room...?
- Yes.

1041
02:06:21,807 --> 02:06:25,448
I know why. For this window, right?
- Yes.

1042
02:06:25,878 --> 02:06:29,121
In this house, this is the only room
from where you get a sea view...

1043
02:06:29,481 --> 02:06:31,961
and a chill breeze through
the window. Enjoy it, Nataraj.

1044
02:06:32,451 --> 02:06:34,453
Not that I crave for all this, Riyaz.
- Then?

1045
02:06:34,853 --> 02:06:36,855
Shweta's house is in that direction.

1046
02:06:40,392 --> 02:06:42,167
It's time for your flight, Riyaz.

1047
02:07:00,779 --> 02:07:02,019
Prapti, wait.

1048
02:07:11,924 --> 02:07:16,373
Why did you avoid me?
- Yesterday I called out to you...

1049
02:07:16,729 --> 02:07:21,769
a hundred times, but you avoided me.
- Oh! Let me explain. Sit.

1050
02:07:23,435 --> 02:07:26,109
You wanted to tell me something.
- Actually...

1051
02:07:27,940 --> 02:07:31,046
Actually, Nataraj...
- What happened to him?

1052
02:07:31,677 --> 02:07:36,057
Nataraj's life is speechless.
Yesterday, I felt...

1053
02:07:36,749 --> 02:07:39,787
I must live the life of a dumb person
for at a least day.

1054
02:07:40,653 --> 02:07:43,725
Which is why I did not speak
to anyone yesterday.

1055
02:07:44,223 --> 02:07:47,204
What's gone wrong with you? The
other day when my Daddy was ill...

1056
02:07:47,559 --> 02:07:50,062
I observed a fast. You had mocked me
saying it was a cheap sentiment.

1057
02:07:50,462 --> 02:07:54,376
What's come over you now?
- To hurt ourselves...

1058
02:07:54,767 --> 02:07:58,840
for someone we love,
gives us a rare satisfaction.

1059
02:07:59,772 --> 02:08:03,413
I don't deny it. But why would
you do that for Nataraj?

1060
02:08:03,776 --> 02:08:06,086
Is it out of pity?
Or is it love?

1061
02:08:14,520 --> 02:08:15,760
I don't know.

1062
02:08:24,596 --> 02:08:29,375
Nataraj, get cracking with this
design. It's urgent, don't delay it.

1063
02:08:32,538 --> 02:08:34,575
If you don't mind,
may I suggest something?

1064
02:08:35,007 --> 02:08:38,113
Suggest what?
- The signboard is perched high up.

1065
02:08:38,544 --> 02:08:42,117
And the painting's background and
design is blue. It may not jell.

1066
02:08:42,581 --> 02:08:45,221
Are you teaching me? What do you know
about colours? Now look...

1067
02:08:45,684 --> 02:08:50,599
your job is to paint what I design.
What do you know about graphics?

1068
02:08:51,023 --> 02:08:52,127
Answer me!

1069
02:08:53,826 --> 02:08:57,797
Graphics, I may not be knowing.
But sketches and colours...

1070
02:08:58,163 --> 02:09:02,475
are something that I know.
- So? So you'll advice me?

1071
02:09:02,835 --> 02:09:06,806
Come, take my seat.
And make a design for me.

1072
02:09:08,841 --> 02:09:12,618
What are you staring at? Are you
fretting? You can't do it, isn't it?

1073
02:09:13,011 --> 02:09:14,820
D'you understand now?

1074
02:09:15,247 --> 02:09:16,624
Sir...
- Quiet!

1075
02:09:18,650 --> 02:09:22,223
Throw this man out of my department.
Go away. Get lost!

1076
02:09:23,288 --> 02:09:27,236
Bloody! He talks about colours.
He thinks he is M.F Hussain.

1077
02:09:50,582 --> 02:09:53,654
What's wrong? You looked worried.
Any problem?

1078
02:09:58,891 --> 02:10:00,996
We need to go somewhere. Come on.

1079
02:10:12,905 --> 02:10:14,316
Come in.

1080
02:10:48,941 --> 02:10:51,854
What're you staring, Nataraj.
All these are your paintings.

1081
02:10:52,277 --> 02:10:54,257
Shweta organised the exhibition.

1082
02:11:16,969 --> 02:11:19,575
One of the greatest painters
in India, Mr Monolisa...

1083
02:11:19,872 --> 02:11:21,715
will now say something about Nataraj,
the artist of the day.

1084
02:11:22,140 --> 02:11:23,278
Greetings.

1085
02:11:24,376 --> 02:11:31,089
Through my friend, Shweta insisted
that I attend this exhibition.

1086
02:11:31,917 --> 02:11:34,625
When I see his works, I feel,
so what if Nataraj can't speak...

1087
02:11:34,987 --> 02:11:37,627
his paintings shall forever
speak about him.

1088
02:11:37,990 --> 02:11:42,962
Had I refused the invitation,
I'd have missed out...

1089
02:11:43,795 --> 02:11:45,775
on a fine artist like Nataraj.

1090
02:12:40,585 --> 02:12:44,362
“Artist acclaimed“. Look, Nataraj's
photograph has appeared in the paper.

1091
02:12:44,756 --> 02:12:47,362
It feels so nice to see someone
amongst us rising to fame.

1092
02:12:47,759 --> 02:12:49,705
I've already seen it on tv.

1093
02:12:50,062 --> 02:12:54,841
I'm thinking how to celebrate it.
- Monica Wines. What's the problem?

1094
02:12:55,233 --> 02:12:58,043
Today is Mahatma Gandhi's birthday.
All shops are shut.

1095
02:12:58,770 --> 02:13:01,410
All right, let's go to Pondichery.
Just two hours ride.

1096
02:13:01,773 --> 02:13:05,448
They're also celebrating his birthday.
- Who told them his date of birth?

1097
02:13:06,878 --> 02:13:09,722
Fine, let's go to our relatives.
- Relatives...??

1098
02:13:10,849 --> 02:13:12,658
Ah, our relatives!

1099
02:13:13,085 --> 02:13:16,760
They might be empty, still won't they
spare their relatives a drop.

1100
02:13:17,856 --> 02:13:21,736
Nataraj's looks made one feel that
he was not fit for love...

1101
02:13:22,094 --> 02:13:26,736
and that he could never be such
a good painter. Many Old Monks...

1102
02:13:28,200 --> 02:13:33,081
mocked him. But Nataraj took it
as a Royal Challenge...

1103
02:13:33,438 --> 02:13:38,410
and today, by making news
he has proved them all wrong.

1104
02:13:39,111 --> 02:13:43,082
As for me, I compare him
with Napoleon.

1105
02:13:48,620 --> 02:13:53,365
What's wrong with him? On the biggest
day of his life he's mourning?

1106
02:13:54,126 --> 02:13:57,335
Let's give him a boost.
- Nataraj, why are you glum?

1107
02:13:57,729 --> 02:14:01,370
Have a drink and
drown your sorrows.

1108
02:14:01,867 --> 02:14:03,676
What's wrong with you?

1109
02:14:05,337 --> 02:14:08,284
I came to Madras with an ambition
to become a great artist.

1110
02:14:09,007 --> 02:14:11,453
Never in my life was I encouraged.

1111
02:14:13,145 --> 02:14:15,785
When I sketched for the first time
at the age of five...

1112
02:14:16,148 --> 02:14:18,149
even my Mother abused me
for scratching the walls.

1113
02:14:18,150 --> 02:14:22,121
In school, my teacher snubbed me
saying that it won't earn me a living

1114
02:14:22,888 --> 02:14:27,359
In my workplace, I was ridiculed for
my looks. None cared for my skills.

1115
02:14:28,160 --> 02:14:33,542
I yearned for a word of praise
for my skills.

1116
02:14:35,400 --> 02:14:39,507
However, today I'm being honoured
in newspapers and tv channels.

1117
02:14:39,771 --> 02:14:41,751
I owe it all to Shweta.

1118
02:14:42,107 --> 02:14:45,953
That I can speak and that I am
in love with her... I never told her.

1119
02:14:46,511 --> 02:14:50,926
That doesn't bother me.
But for this favour she has done...

1120
02:14:51,283 --> 02:14:56,232
I can't even convey to her a word
of thanks. That hurts like hell.

1121
02:14:58,390 --> 02:15:00,495
I can't bear it any longer.

1122
02:15:01,927 --> 02:15:04,237
I'm going to reveal the truth to her.

1123
02:15:13,939 --> 02:15:16,510
There's still more invites to be
distributed for my dance programme.

1124
02:15:16,942 --> 02:15:20,515
Stop looking around and walk with me.
- I don't know why, but of late...

1125
02:15:20,879 --> 02:15:23,587
I've taken a liking to this street.
- This street...?

1126
02:15:24,082 --> 02:15:26,995
A street that follows no discipline?
Where, everyone jostle each other?

1127
02:15:27,385 --> 02:15:29,991
You like it?
Let's get out of here.

1128
02:15:30,489 --> 02:15:33,868
Shweta, when I walk into this street,
I get the feeling that...

1129
02:15:34,226 --> 02:15:36,934
this world is a one big family.
You get to see so many things here.

1130
02:15:37,362 --> 02:15:39,342
A father buying his baby
a feeding bottle.

1131
02:15:40,098 --> 02:15:42,078
A husband buying a gift
for his wife.

1132
02:15:42,300 --> 02:15:44,780
A family buying a new dress
for their adolescent girl.

1133
02:15:45,237 --> 02:15:47,217
Everywhere we can see a
family atmosphere around us.

1134
02:15:47,572 --> 02:15:50,815
A new found attachment
towards family? What gives?

1135
02:15:51,243 --> 02:15:54,417
Of late I've begun to like our system
of wedding and having a family.

1136
02:15:55,313 --> 02:15:58,089
Then why don't you marry?
- For which I need you.

1137
02:16:14,065 --> 02:16:16,568
Who...? You'll marry Nataraj?
Shweta, what are you saying?

1138
02:16:16,935 --> 02:16:20,348
Have you given it a good thought?
- Yes Aunt.

1139
02:16:21,039 --> 02:16:22,746
Are you sure?
- Yes.

1140
02:16:29,281 --> 02:16:34,594
Look Shweta, traveling alone bugs us,
and we look for someone to talk to.

1141
02:16:35,153 --> 02:16:38,430
Even a day's journey compels us
to talk to someone.

1142
02:16:38,790 --> 02:16:41,600
How'll you journey through life
in the company of a person...

1143
02:16:41,960 --> 02:16:44,270
who is forever speechless?
- Uncle...

1144
02:16:45,030 --> 02:16:48,341
love isn't all about
exchanging words.

1145
02:16:49,100 --> 02:16:51,603
It's about understanding
the feelings of each other.

1146
02:16:53,004 --> 02:16:55,450
For which you don't need
words to describe.

1147
02:16:59,311 --> 02:17:02,349
I'm not deterring you because
you refused to marry my son.

1148
02:17:02,714 --> 02:17:07,288
But I think it isn't love, it is
a feeling of empathy towards Nataraj.

1149
02:17:07,652 --> 02:17:13,102
In that case, I'd have helped him in
some way, and walked out of his life.

1150
02:17:14,125 --> 02:17:19,040
But, why do I feel like
I need him by my side forever?

1151
02:17:22,667 --> 02:17:27,480
Once he lied to me about having
studied in the College of Ads.

1152
02:17:28,340 --> 02:17:32,117
But he couldn't put up with the lie,
he came and told me the truth.

1153
02:17:32,544 --> 02:17:34,524
I'm in love with his honest self.

1154
02:17:38,350 --> 02:17:43,129
Soon after my dance programme,
I'll be returning to America.

1155
02:17:43,521 --> 02:17:48,493
The thought of losing Nataraj
forever, is tearing me apart

1156
02:17:54,866 --> 02:17:57,005
Love is something
that blossoms on its own.

1157
02:17:57,502 --> 02:18:00,574
Why and when love blossoms,
you never know.

1158
02:18:02,173 --> 02:18:04,153
Please try and understand me.

1159
02:18:19,157 --> 02:18:22,866
I know you hate lies.
Still, I kept lying to you.

1160
02:18:24,262 --> 02:18:28,176
For my desire to end up in America,
I pretended to be very nice to you.

1161
02:18:30,502 --> 02:18:33,915
But Nataraj isn't like me,
he's as straight as an arrow.

1162
02:18:35,674 --> 02:18:41,681
He never expected anything from you.
He has a clear conscience.

1163
02:18:43,315 --> 02:18:48,389
I feel, these qualities of him
evoked the love for him. True?

1164
02:18:56,328 --> 02:18:57,932
Now I realise...

1165
02:18:58,430 --> 02:19:01,468
Like what Nataraj
wrote on your birthday...

1166
02:19:01,966 --> 02:19:05,709
Had I truly loved you,
I'd have had your love.

1167
02:19:09,441 --> 02:19:11,751
But America is what I truly loved.

1168
02:19:18,383 --> 02:19:22,422
Love is all about mutual trust.

1169
02:19:23,455 --> 02:19:28,700
I have implicit trust in Nataraj.
He can never deceive me in any way.

1170
02:19:35,467 --> 02:19:37,538
Did you propose him?

1171
02:19:41,840 --> 02:19:43,820
He loves the night of full Moon.

1172
02:19:46,478 --> 02:19:50,153
On the coming night of full Moon,
I shall profess my love to him.

1173
02:20:22,514 --> 02:20:26,155
Invitation to my dance programme.
Not just Prapti, you must come too.

1174
02:20:26,518 --> 02:20:30,159
Sure. I want to see how good
an American is at Bharat Natyam.

1175
02:20:30,522 --> 02:20:36,063
I'll make coffee for you.
- Mom, ask Geeta reduce the tv volume

1176
02:20:36,528 --> 02:20:39,509
Let's sit.
- I don't like my dress I chose...

1177
02:20:39,864 --> 02:20:44,108
for the dance. I think I'll take
Nataraj along to chose a nice dress.

1178
02:20:44,536 --> 02:20:47,676
That reminds me. Have you decided?
- What?

1179
02:20:48,072 --> 02:20:53,078
About Nataraj. You said you don't
know if it's sympathy or love.

1180
02:20:53,545 --> 02:20:55,525
Have you reached a conclusion
at least now?

1181
02:20:56,548 --> 02:21:03,329
Yes. Besides, I've already informed
Vikram's family, and my parents too.

1182
02:21:03,721 --> 02:21:05,064
Informed what?

1183
02:21:07,559 --> 02:21:09,539
That I'm going to marry Nataraj.

1184
02:21:10,562 --> 02:21:14,237
Come again.
- I'm going to marry Nataraj.

1185
02:21:14,632 --> 02:21:17,943
My, my! I wish our dance teacher
were here now.

1186
02:21:18,336 --> 02:21:21,283
When you joined the class,
you never knew the word "shy".

1187
02:21:21,673 --> 02:21:24,119
And now, look at you shying away!

1188
02:21:26,578 --> 02:21:30,822
The dumb uncle whom you brought along
the other day, is on tv. Come on.

1189
02:21:31,316 --> 02:21:35,355
Repeat telecast. This time I wish to
see the complete programme. Come on.

1190
02:21:35,820 --> 02:21:40,132
Aren't you ashamed? Are you deaf?
Or, are you dumb?

1191
02:21:40,592 --> 02:21:43,903
You're calling me dumb?
Do I look like a dumb?

1192
02:22:29,941 --> 02:22:31,614
Welcome.
Karthik, look.

1193
02:22:32,644 --> 02:22:34,624
Welcome.
- Does Nataraj speak?

1194
02:22:38,816 --> 02:22:42,787
Can Nataraj speak?
- What're you talking?

1195
02:22:43,354 --> 02:22:46,198
He is mute. He is speechless.

1196
02:22:46,658 --> 02:22:48,296
I saw him on tv.

1197
02:22:48,793 --> 02:22:50,431
I know everything.

1198
02:22:51,963 --> 02:22:54,637
I asked you! Does he talk or not?

1199
02:22:55,333 --> 02:22:58,871
He talks. But the reason
he hid it from you is...

1200
02:23:00,538 --> 02:23:03,849
I don't want reasons.
I need to see him right now.

1201
02:23:05,677 --> 02:23:07,816
Where is he?
- He had left for your place...

1202
02:23:08,179 --> 02:23:10,659
to tell you everything.
He hasn't returned yet.

1203
02:23:11,015 --> 02:23:13,461
We've enquired everywhere,
but he's not to be found.

1204
02:23:13,818 --> 02:23:15,661
I was just trying your number.

1205
02:23:32,437 --> 02:23:36,180
You're right. Now it strikes,
tonight is a full Moon night.

1206
02:23:36,574 --> 02:23:38,554
And Nataraj has to be
in Mahabalipuram. For sure.

1207
02:24:10,808 --> 02:24:14,881
What use is knowing a girl for years
without understanding her character?

1208
02:24:17,482 --> 02:24:21,453
You imagine me completely
as a headless being, don't you?

1209
02:24:23,755 --> 02:24:27,066
How could you just blindly imagine...

1210
02:24:27,492 --> 02:24:33,738
that I'd treat you as I treated
that treacherous beggar?

1211
02:24:40,838 --> 02:24:44,081
You can't differentiate
between empathy and love?

1212
02:24:46,778 --> 02:24:49,156
I showed empathy towards the beggar.

1213
02:24:50,782 --> 02:24:52,762
And towards you it is...

1214
02:24:53,484 --> 02:24:55,464
love.

1215
02:25:00,658 --> 02:25:05,505
I feel, when you expect nothing out
of a relationship, it is called love.

1216
02:25:06,597 --> 02:25:11,774
You lied to me. But I couldn't
bring myself to abuse you.

1217
02:25:20,545 --> 02:25:26,791
I hate lies. And how you have
honoured that sentiment of mine!

1218
02:25:36,894 --> 02:25:39,807
I enjoyed every moment we shared.

1219
02:25:40,832 --> 02:25:45,611
But you... living with the lie
had been killing you every moment.

1220
02:25:48,439 --> 02:25:50,419
You don't need
to live that moment anymore.

1221
02:25:52,710 --> 02:25:54,690
Talk... talk to me.

1222
02:25:56,147 --> 02:25:58,149
I wish to hear your voice.

1223
02:25:59,751 --> 02:26:01,628
Please say something.

1224
02:26:05,656 --> 02:26:08,296
I pine to hear you say
"I love you".

1225
02:26:09,026 --> 02:26:11,506
I undauntedly told my family
that I love you.

1226
02:26:13,865 --> 02:26:16,106
Can't you say it to me?

1227
02:26:18,870 --> 02:26:23,114
Oh, come on Nataraj.
Shweta herself comes seeking you.

1228
02:26:23,608 --> 02:26:29,422
Enough of the charade. Shweta knows
you can talk. Just say it.

1229
02:26:31,883 --> 02:26:33,658
C'mon, say something to Shweta.

1230
02:26:44,262 --> 02:26:47,869
I beg of you. Please doctor.

1231
02:26:49,667 --> 02:26:51,544
Do you take me for a butcher?

1232
02:26:51,903 --> 02:26:55,749
Take my voice away, doctor.
I don't want my larynx.

1233
02:26:57,909 --> 02:27:01,152
What d'you take me for? I try to help
my patients to rid their disability.

1234
02:27:01,646 --> 02:27:04,718
I don't impair someone.
- I too am a patient, doctor.

1235
02:27:05,116 --> 02:27:10,065
My disease is that I talk. Make
me dumb, and rid me of my disease.

1236
02:27:10,454 --> 02:27:13,196
Get lost, you fool! You want to
land me behind the bars?

1237
02:27:13,624 --> 02:27:18,232
You're scared of the police,
but I'm scared of my conscience.

1238
02:27:18,663 --> 02:27:21,576
I can never get rid of my conscience.
But I can get rid of myself.

1239
02:27:21,933 --> 02:27:23,913
Yes, I can kill myself, doctor!

1240
02:27:48,960 --> 02:27:51,406
I've got an idea,
that's why I called you back.

1241
02:27:52,964 --> 02:27:56,502
Come to me again acting dumb. And
I shall pretend giving you treatment.

1242
02:27:56,968 --> 02:27:59,278
Let's tell her that the treatment
cured you. You won't have to...

1243
02:27:59,637 --> 02:28:01,947
forsake your love nor sacrifice
your larynx. What d'you say?

1244
02:28:03,040 --> 02:28:07,614
Doctor, I dread to see myself
in the mirror.

1245
02:28:08,579 --> 02:28:10,957
And Shweta wants to live
a lifetime with me.

1246
02:28:11,315 --> 02:28:14,228
No, I just can't lie to her again.
- You fool!

1247
02:28:14,919 --> 02:28:17,559
What'll you do if someday she
finds out the truth and dumps you?

1248
02:28:17,989 --> 02:28:19,969
Won't your sacrifice go in vain?

1249
02:28:20,758 --> 02:28:23,967
I don't want to sacrifice my vocal
chord to bring Shweta into my life.

1250
02:28:24,495 --> 02:28:29,467
My sacrifice is to atone for
betraying her trust in me.

1251
02:28:34,906 --> 02:28:36,886
Shall I have a word
with her? Just once?

1252
02:28:38,009 --> 02:28:43,982
If you do, she might come to me
out of pity.

1253
02:28:44,715 --> 02:28:47,992
Doctor, I don't want love
that arises out of pity.

1254
02:28:48,953 --> 02:28:51,399
Shweta loves me truly, because
she believes I am a nice man.

1255
02:28:51,822 --> 02:28:53,665
I pine for such a love.

1256
02:28:56,027 --> 02:28:58,007
Is she such a nice girl?

1257
02:29:39,470 --> 02:29:44,283
Consider me a friend. Let me
tell you, medical science...

1258
02:29:44,809 --> 02:29:49,519
can restore one's eyesight.
It can revive a lapsed head.

1259
02:29:50,081 --> 02:29:53,119
Also, it can revive memory.

1260
02:29:54,785 --> 02:29:58,062
But the larynx... impossible!

1261
02:29:59,023 --> 02:30:01,060
It's a very peculiar organ.

1262
02:30:02,793 --> 02:30:07,572
Now tell me. Do you want love?
Or do you want your larynx?

1263
02:30:10,301 --> 02:30:14,340
No hasty decisions.
For my sake, please...

1264
02:30:16,107 --> 02:30:18,747
think for a few seconds.

1265
02:30:38,029 --> 02:30:40,771
I want love, I don't want my voice.

1266
02:30:42,299 --> 02:30:45,769
Okay. I shall perform the operation.

1267
02:30:48,639 --> 02:30:52,712
For the sake of love,
men have hanged themselves...

1268
02:30:53,144 --> 02:30:56,125
they have jumped to their deaths,
jumped in front of a running train!

1269
02:30:57,148 --> 02:30:59,321
It takes fifteen minutes
to die from hanging.

1270
02:31:00,151 --> 02:31:02,256
A jump takes one's life
the next moment he falls.

1271
02:31:03,154 --> 02:31:06,135
For love's sake, these men endure
agony only for such a shod span.

1272
02:31:07,191 --> 02:31:10,604
For the first time in my life,
I see a man...

1273
02:31:10,961 --> 02:31:13,601
who is prepared to live his entire
life in agony, for love's sake.

1274
02:31:17,101 --> 02:31:18,808
I read you, Nataraj.

1275
02:31:20,237 --> 02:31:24,947
On the full Moon night, when Shweta
comes to profess her love to you...

1276
02:31:27,078 --> 02:31:29,251
you will be a man who really
deserves her love.

1277
02:31:31,082 --> 02:31:32,823
I will perform the operation.

1278
02:31:48,199 --> 02:31:49,177
Go in.

1279
02:31:51,001 --> 02:31:54,448
Sir, the operation is at 8.30.
Please don't eat anything till then.

1280
02:32:31,976 --> 02:32:35,355
Everything is ready. The doctor
wants you in the patient's uniform.

1281
02:32:36,147 --> 02:32:38,320
Do I have to come immediately?
- Yes.

1282
02:32:38,749 --> 02:32:40,729
Actually, I need to be alone
for sometime.

1283
02:33:11,782 --> 02:33:13,056
Mother...

1284
02:33:14,485 --> 02:33:15,793
Mother...

1285
02:33:42,046 --> 02:33:43,753
What happened, sir?

1286
02:33:44,181 --> 02:33:46,024
Nothing. Go on, I'm coming.

1287
02:33:47,017 --> 02:33:51,762
Doctor has gone mad. He wants the
address of some girl called Shweta.

1288
02:33:52,122 --> 02:33:56,298
God knows when she had come for
an ENT test. Can you help me find it?

1289
02:34:19,283 --> 02:34:20,990
You conned me, didn't you?

1290
02:34:23,053 --> 02:34:25,897
You cheated me, didn't you?
- Nataraj...

1291
02:34:26,357 --> 02:34:28,997
what I'm doing is for your own good.
I'm a doctor, after all.

1292
02:34:30,094 --> 02:34:33,132
You check a patient's body,
how can you feel a person's heart?

1293
02:34:33,430 --> 02:34:37,936
You must've found love very easily,
but you never understood my love.

1294
02:34:38,369 --> 02:34:40,349
I can't betray
my profession, Nataraj.

1295
02:34:41,372 --> 02:34:46,117
Likewise, I cannot betray my love.

1296
02:34:46,543 --> 02:34:48,921
I can't betray my lover!

1297
02:34:49,380 --> 02:34:50,358
I can't!
