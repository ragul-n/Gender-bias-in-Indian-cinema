1
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,336
It was during the 14th century B.C.

2
00:02:09,532 --> 00:02:13,055
Atrocity was ruling in the
Southern parts of India.

3
00:02:13,196 --> 00:02:16,977
Country was in a state of
havoc due to British invasions.

4
00:02:17,157 --> 00:02:19,067
This situation of panic made everyone...

5
00:02:19,091 --> 00:02:23,665
from the common people
to the tribes in the jungle...

6
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:25,985
go into distress.

7
00:02:26,024 --> 00:02:32,924
But a powerful force has fought
back and put an end to this exploitation.

8
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:36,869
It has paved welcome to a free Kingdom.

9
00:02:39,276 --> 00:02:41,119
And that powerful force is...

10
00:02:41,174 --> 00:02:44,611
'Mahadhivara' Madhava Vidyaranya Swamy.

11
00:02:50,891 --> 00:02:55,406
His weapons were Harihara
Bukka Raya brothers.

12
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:58,554
The Kingdom they established post war is...

13
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,718
Vijayanagaram.

14
00:03:02,508 --> 00:03:04,632
After claiming victory over the British...

15
00:03:04,797 --> 00:03:07,148
A grand treasure of glorious wealth...

16
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,617
came into the possession
of Vidyaranya Swamy.

17
00:03:09,642 --> 00:03:12,453
To ensure that the treasure is bound
secure for generations to come...

18
00:03:12,478 --> 00:03:15,984
He has come up with an
efficient security system.

19
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:34,929
A treasure guarded by layers of security.

20
00:03:34,954 --> 00:03:40,031
A treasure hidden in a remote
spot in the Kishkinda mountain.

21
00:03:40,766 --> 00:03:45,500
Vidyaranya Swamy met with
the tribes that he has rescued...

22
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,586
in a secret gathering later that night.

23
00:03:52,008 --> 00:03:56,640
'The box of trickery' is a device that
I've created to claim the treasure.

24
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:59,874
Order, sir!

25
00:04:00,359 --> 00:04:02,359
Swamy, you didn't just
protect your Kingdom.

26
00:04:02,384 --> 00:04:05,039
You're like God to us for
having rescued our tribe.

27
00:04:05,961 --> 00:04:08,164
If that box is sealed by your command...

28
00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:10,601
We will guard it for
generations to come, sir.

29
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,906
That's fantastic!

30
00:04:12,492 --> 00:04:16,257
I leave this 'Box of
Trickery' in your possession.

31
00:04:16,282 --> 00:04:17,851
My pleasure, sir.

32
00:04:18,211 --> 00:04:21,328
Skies might come crumbling down.
But this box shouldn't be dropped.

33
00:04:21,398 --> 00:04:22,898
Order, sir.

34
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:24,765
At your command!

35
00:04:26,617 --> 00:04:30,656
Summoning pivotal members
of the Vijayanagaram Kingdom...

36
00:04:30,695 --> 00:04:34,195
Vidyaranya Swamy called
for another meeting that day.

37
00:04:35,452 --> 00:04:37,265
Minister!
-Sir.

38
00:04:39,656 --> 00:04:40,929
This is a copper contour.

39
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:44,812
The device that leads to the location of
the 'Box of Trickery' in times of threat.

40
00:04:45,828 --> 00:04:48,867
It's not just the responsibility
of the Emperor of the State.

41
00:04:48,892 --> 00:04:50,476
Ministers are equally responsible.

42
00:04:50,953 --> 00:04:52,020
At your command, sir.

43
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:55,351
Ministers who come after you...

44
00:04:55,376 --> 00:04:59,437
they're passed on the responsiblity
of protecting this copper contour.

45
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:03,100
When the Kingdom is
faced with uncertainty...

46
00:05:03,132 --> 00:05:08,038
I want the Minister of that time to follow
my instructions on this copper contour.

47
00:05:09,928 --> 00:05:13,749
Along with finding the
treasure as per instructions...

48
00:05:14,062 --> 00:05:16,421
Protecting the King and his people...

49
00:05:16,695 --> 00:05:19,280
inevitably becomes the responsibility
of the Minister and his units.

50
00:05:20,226 --> 00:05:21,421
Order, sir!

51
00:05:21,695 --> 00:05:24,273
I'll take immediate action.

52
00:05:26,132 --> 00:05:28,538
Towards the end of this
confidential gathering...

53
00:05:28,563 --> 00:05:31,199
Vidyaranya Swamy said something...

54
00:05:31,223 --> 00:05:35,109
that forever echoed in the
hearts of everyone present there.

55
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,132
One final thing!

56
00:05:38,726 --> 00:05:41,421
The person who sets
out to find that treasure...

57
00:05:41,446 --> 00:05:44,937
He should be someone willing to
sacrifice his life for the Kingdom.

58
00:05:44,962 --> 00:05:49,456
Someone who's selfish,
dim-witted and a coward...

59
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,093
That treasure will bring him death!

60
00:06:38,713 --> 00:06:40,671
"The warrior on the path of victory"

61
00:06:40,719 --> 00:06:42,362
"Hey, Dhira!"

62
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:50,389
"Listen to this story
It's like a game of chess"

63
00:07:50,734 --> 00:07:53,374
"Make your move
Be smart about it"

64
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:55,765
"Life is a battle"

65
00:07:56,047 --> 00:07:58,663
"Here comes the horse
Ants batallion goes runnin"

66
00:07:58,688 --> 00:08:01,311
"Strike when least expected"

67
00:08:01,336 --> 00:08:04,027
"Clear the confusion
Reveal the trick"

68
00:08:04,051 --> 00:08:06,507
"Victory is a gimmick"

69
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:12,562
"More than the strong-armed man"

70
00:08:12,587 --> 00:08:18,179
"It's the one with brilliance
that makes more impact"

71
00:08:47,187 --> 00:08:49,882
"Army is on the go"

72
00:08:49,906 --> 00:08:51,752
"Adventure begins"

73
00:08:51,777 --> 00:08:54,377
"He who kills a few is a warrior"

74
00:08:54,402 --> 00:08:56,892
"He who saves a few is God"

75
00:08:57,883 --> 00:09:00,523
"Sword is sharpened"

76
00:09:00,548 --> 00:09:02,509
"Trust is everything"

77
00:09:02,534 --> 00:09:05,041
"He who is superstitious is a fool"

78
00:09:05,066 --> 00:09:08,041
"He who acts smart is a winner"

79
00:09:08,533 --> 00:09:13,861
"He who dispels darkness is the Sun"

80
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:18,620
"Fight a war of wisdom
and you'll never lose"

81
00:09:29,324 --> 00:09:31,993
"This is one mysterious story"

82
00:09:32,019 --> 00:09:34,407
"Notice how it unfolds interestingly"

83
00:09:34,722 --> 00:09:37,392
"Sharpen your senses enough to stop war"

84
00:09:37,417 --> 00:09:39,666
"Intelligence is your weapon"

85
00:09:40,042 --> 00:09:45,033
"Blow the conch shell, get the
chariot moving, plot and strategize"

86
00:09:45,331 --> 00:09:48,034
"Don't let victory get to your head"

87
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:50,729
"That would just make you a fool"

88
00:09:51,213 --> 00:09:56,565
"More than the vigorous
man who roars with fervor"

89
00:09:56,590 --> 00:10:02,659
"It's the one who keeps his ego in
check that conquers the battlefield"

90
00:10:37,467 --> 00:10:39,192
16th century...

91
00:10:39,217 --> 00:10:41,655
Approximately 200 years have passed.

92
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:44,983
Vijayanagaram Kingdom didn't
just progress politically.

93
00:10:45,091 --> 00:10:47,404
But also socially and economically.

94
00:10:47,444 --> 00:10:53,099
It has shaped into the capital
for literary and cultural arts.

95
00:10:53,124 --> 00:10:55,896
A place of prosperity and abundance.

96
00:11:35,691 --> 00:11:38,836
"The sculptures of Hampi come to life"

97
00:11:38,862 --> 00:11:41,942
"It's a land that celebrates art"

98
00:11:41,966 --> 00:11:45,051
"The Creator is impressed
by the exquisiteness"

99
00:11:45,076 --> 00:11:47,770
"You're bound to be mesmerized"

100
00:11:47,794 --> 00:11:50,700
"Like in a fantasy"

101
00:11:51,888 --> 00:11:54,410
"Astonishing culture!"

102
00:11:54,723 --> 00:11:57,512
"Riveting infrastructure!"

103
00:11:58,044 --> 00:12:00,567
"Prosperous land and people"

104
00:12:00,592 --> 00:12:04,285
"Flourishing kingdom!"

105
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:06,864
"Exhilirating atmosphere!"

106
00:12:06,889 --> 00:12:10,153
"Gracious aura!"

107
00:12:39,536 --> 00:12:41,684
Truth. Righteousness. Empathy.

108
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:45,160
With these qualities
as the driving force...

109
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:47,945
Going beyond caste
and creed discrimination...

110
00:12:47,969 --> 00:12:51,527
Our lineage has ruled the
Vijayanagaram Kingdom flawlessly.

111
00:12:51,682 --> 00:12:52,815
Our beloved ancestors.

112
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,722
I reminisce them on this occasion.

113
00:13:02,091 --> 00:13:05,704
In the glorious literary history
of our Vijayanagaram Kingdom...

114
00:13:05,728 --> 00:13:08,106
there's a void to be
filled by a witty poet.

115
00:13:08,575 --> 00:13:10,903
Doesn't that mean our defeat, Appaji?

116
00:13:13,489 --> 00:13:17,778
Everything in concern with the
Vijayanagaram Kingdom exists in numbers of 8.

117
00:13:17,808 --> 00:13:21,348
8 mountains surrounding
the Kingdom from all ends.

118
00:13:21,544 --> 00:13:25,168
8 army camps canvassing
the fort at all times.

119
00:13:25,778 --> 00:13:28,785
8 entrances to the grand hall.

120
00:13:30,302 --> 00:13:34,598
But the number of poets
in our assembly... only 7.

121
00:13:36,974 --> 00:13:39,856
It was my desire to host
8 poets in my Empire.

122
00:13:39,881 --> 00:13:42,989
It is a shame that I have to settle for 7.

123
00:13:43,724 --> 00:13:48,739
The 8th poet's throne keeps haunting me.

124
00:13:55,075 --> 00:13:56,958
Salutations, My Lord!

125
00:13:56,983 --> 00:14:00,794
I am the most intelligent
person in this assembly.

126
00:14:00,819 --> 00:14:02,841
I shall prove it to you, Highness.

127
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:10,848
I mean, after my guru Thathacharyulu...

128
00:14:10,873 --> 00:14:15,106
I am the only poet who
can live up to his legacy.

129
00:14:15,131 --> 00:14:19,075
My Lord, I have a question for the 7 poets.

130
00:14:19,271 --> 00:14:21,684
6 equals 9.

131
00:14:21,825 --> 00:14:24,512
9 equals 6.

132
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,536
Enough thinking. Give me the answer.

133
00:14:43,044 --> 00:14:44,473
Mr. Skinny-Tinny...

134
00:14:47,107 --> 00:14:51,575
I can't seem to find the
answer to your riddle.

135
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:55,981
So, none of you is
even slightly intelligent.

136
00:14:56,185 --> 00:14:59,051
That makes me the most
intelligent guy out here.

137
00:14:59,076 --> 00:15:01,356
Yay! I'm the most intelligent guy.

138
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:04,434
Yay! I'm the most intelligent guy.

139
00:15:04,459 --> 00:15:07,489
Yay! I'm the most intelligent guy.

140
00:15:15,403 --> 00:15:19,028
Look, this is number 6.

141
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:20,801
Am I right?

142
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:25,762
Now watch me turn it into number 9.

143
00:15:26,371 --> 00:15:29,708
There you go! Number 9!

144
00:15:43,997 --> 00:15:47,747
My Lord, if you could be gracious
and give me another chance...

145
00:15:47,772 --> 00:15:51,231
I shall definitely impress you this time.

146
00:15:55,855 --> 00:15:56,918
This time...

147
00:15:57,302 --> 00:16:00,528
I will show you how number
9 becomes number 6.

148
00:16:00,553 --> 00:16:04,387
Are you planning to show
the same plate upside down?

149
00:16:04,419 --> 00:16:06,333
No, Your Highness. Not at all.

150
00:16:08,107 --> 00:16:08,880
My Lord!

151
00:16:09,724 --> 00:16:12,583
You're going to witness a miracle now.

152
00:16:12,776 --> 00:16:17,614
It's a trick that has never
been done before on this planet.

153
00:16:17,653 --> 00:16:19,981
Illusion of Illusions!

154
00:16:23,044 --> 00:16:24,268
As you say, My Lord.

155
00:16:25,669 --> 00:16:26,973
This is number 9.

156
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:30,067
Number becomes becomes number 6.

157
00:16:37,318 --> 00:16:42,355
Despite the presence of 7 poets
in our assembly, I feel a void.

158
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,880
I wish to host another poet.

159
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:49,528
He should be a witty poet with a
humorous take on every problem.

160
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:28,137
"He's like the little Krishna
under Yashoda Ma's care"

161
00:17:28,426 --> 00:17:33,161
"You have showered him with love"

162
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:37,653
"You have filled that milk with affection"

163
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:42,208
"You have shown concern in those eyes"

164
00:17:42,233 --> 00:17:47,106
"Joy resides where
motherly love flourishes"

165
00:18:06,231 --> 00:18:08,886
[praying]

166
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:15,636
Oh, lord! I have only one wish in my life.

167
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:18,121
I don't have to tell you in particular.

168
00:18:18,456 --> 00:18:20,152
My son wants to earn a living as a poet.

169
00:18:20,442 --> 00:18:23,316
Please make sure that his
passion makes him some money.

170
00:18:23,652 --> 00:18:24,379
Wow!

171
00:18:24,652 --> 00:18:26,683
Those are such beautiful
words, Rama Krishna.

172
00:18:27,004 --> 00:18:28,184
Well done, mate!

173
00:18:28,957 --> 00:18:30,066
Well done! Seriously!

174
00:18:30,091 --> 00:18:33,910
You're flooding the house with
those poems that aren't worth a penny.

175
00:18:33,934 --> 00:18:36,042
You really need to appreciate yourself.

176
00:18:36,551 --> 00:18:40,089
But I'm not getting a single
opportunity to prove myself.

177
00:18:40,106 --> 00:18:42,558
Opportunities don't come
knocking on our doors, Rama.

178
00:18:42,598 --> 00:18:44,363
We need to create some.

179
00:18:44,388 --> 00:18:47,004
If you confine your
poetry to these 4 walls...

180
00:18:47,027 --> 00:18:49,980
it won't be worth anything to us.

181
00:18:50,191 --> 00:18:52,582
Go some place that values your presence.

182
00:18:52,723 --> 00:18:54,933
Earn a job that is
worthy of your potential.

183
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:16,582
He will never change.

184
00:19:16,731 --> 00:19:18,214
I feel so helpless.

185
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:31,316
When are my struggling days going to end?

186
00:19:38,449 --> 00:19:41,800
I'm hurting my mother with
my irresponsible behavior.

187
00:19:42,691 --> 00:19:45,394
I need to see to it that
she's happy hereafter.

188
00:20:45,071 --> 00:20:46,071
Thank god!

189
00:20:46,205 --> 00:20:47,906
You finally smiled!

190
00:20:48,618 --> 00:20:49,555
Lakshmamma...

191
00:20:50,454 --> 00:20:52,883
From tomorrow onwards,
I'll go hunting for a job.

192
00:20:53,923 --> 00:20:56,500
I knew you would come around, Rama.

193
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,625
Rama!

194
00:21:17,446 --> 00:21:19,312
Come what may...

195
00:21:19,524 --> 00:21:21,945
survive the fight and conquer!

196
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:24,133
Victory be upon you!

197
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:25,641
See you soon, dear.

198
00:21:46,782 --> 00:21:47,805
Hello, sir...

199
00:21:49,211 --> 00:21:50,500
Who are you?

200
00:21:51,423 --> 00:21:53,883
What brings you here?
-I'm a poet.

201
00:21:54,867 --> 00:21:56,836
Oh! You're a poet!

202
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:59,086
Yes. A poet. Can you help me find a job?

203
00:21:59,111 --> 00:22:01,111
People here slog through their days.

204
00:22:01,136 --> 00:22:05,258
Who would come forward
to help a poet like you?

205
00:22:07,586 --> 00:22:10,633
Please leave already!

206
00:22:16,211 --> 00:22:17,305
Go away!

207
00:22:18,001 --> 00:22:21,172
Get out of my sight!
Poets have no place here.

208
00:22:22,297 --> 00:22:24,688
So, what if you're a poet?
You don't belong here.

209
00:22:39,048 --> 00:22:42,149
We work hard the entire day in the farms.

210
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,344
And at dusk, we assemble here.

211
00:22:45,352 --> 00:22:48,028
We share our joys and sorrows...

212
00:22:48,052 --> 00:22:50,727
Do you have any knowledge of poems?

213
00:22:51,001 --> 00:22:52,844
What did you say? Poems?

214
00:22:53,688 --> 00:22:55,820
Not my thing, sir.

215
00:22:56,227 --> 00:23:00,352
But, Mr. Ramanadham is a poem lover.

216
00:23:01,407 --> 00:23:03,930
There he comes.

217
00:23:23,356 --> 00:23:24,886
Greetings, you all!

218
00:23:26,481 --> 00:23:28,902
Please be seated, everyone.

219
00:23:31,371 --> 00:23:33,449
What's special this evening?

220
00:23:33,777 --> 00:23:34,769
I am a poet.

221
00:23:35,223 --> 00:23:37,269
Oh! Really!

222
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,972
Well done!

223
00:23:39,137 --> 00:23:43,004
Narrate a nice stanza
from one of your works.

224
00:23:47,035 --> 00:23:49,472
[reciting a poem]

225
00:24:03,628 --> 00:24:04,519
Stop!

226
00:24:04,556 --> 00:24:05,558
Enough!

227
00:24:05,863 --> 00:24:07,964
Oh, my god! Holy moly!

228
00:24:08,105 --> 00:24:11,613
I didn't get a single word you sang.

229
00:24:11,637 --> 00:24:12,925
What the hell!

230
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:15,056
I've never heard anything worse.

231
00:24:15,081 --> 00:24:17,011
Hope I make it home tonight.

232
00:24:19,238 --> 00:24:20,566
You call this poetry?!

233
00:24:20,942 --> 00:24:21,644
Huh?

234
00:24:22,098 --> 00:24:24,535
When people don't
understand a word you say...

235
00:24:24,597 --> 00:24:26,558
I see no point in your poetry.

236
00:24:26,621 --> 00:24:29,152
Quit your unreasonable attempts.

237
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:10,175
Don't be disappointed, you young poet.

238
00:25:15,567 --> 00:25:16,730
You're calling me a poet?

239
00:25:17,137 --> 00:25:18,371
Might as well mock me directly.

240
00:25:18,396 --> 00:25:21,816
I'm not mocking you.
I'm applauding your poetic potential.

241
00:25:23,348 --> 00:25:28,183
Nobody here is capable of
recognizing a talent like yours.

242
00:25:30,215 --> 00:25:32,433
Where do you think I should go?
-Vijayanagaram.

243
00:25:36,081 --> 00:25:38,113
The King there is a great pandit himself.

244
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:45,832
He is trying relentlessly to
host 8 poets in his assembly.

245
00:25:49,129 --> 00:25:53,355
That is the only place where
your poetry will be honored.

246
00:25:53,637 --> 00:25:55,839
Take my word for it and go there.

247
00:25:55,864 --> 00:25:57,550
Things will turn in your favor.

248
00:25:59,323 --> 00:26:03,128
I really wish that I find someone
who would laud my talent, sir.

249
00:26:03,667 --> 00:26:05,667
"Obedience is in your nature"

250
00:26:06,348 --> 00:26:07,988
"Sky is yours to scale"

251
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:10,629
"March foward with might"

252
00:26:10,659 --> 00:26:12,659
Victory be upon you!
-"Mother trusts you"

253
00:26:13,192 --> 00:26:14,597
"Do this for her"

254
00:26:14,622 --> 00:26:16,957
You have the blessings
of your mother and guru.

255
00:26:17,074 --> 00:26:19,894
God will definitely shower his grace, son.

256
00:26:20,652 --> 00:26:23,019
"A sage has guided
you in the right direction"

257
00:26:23,043 --> 00:26:25,347
"There's no stopping your pen now"

258
00:26:25,372 --> 00:26:27,769
"You belong on top of the mountain"

259
00:26:27,801 --> 00:26:30,168
"Make your mark with every step"

260
00:26:30,193 --> 00:26:32,519
"Lift the sword of brilliance"

261
00:26:32,544 --> 00:26:34,902
"Don't let anything push you down"

262
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:37,293
"Carve yourself into a sculpture"

263
00:26:37,318 --> 00:26:39,668
"Let the drums of victory play"

264
00:26:39,706 --> 00:26:41,706
"Victory is your right"

265
00:26:41,746 --> 00:26:43,730
"Just stay determined"

266
00:26:44,418 --> 00:26:46,293
"Conviction is your weapon"

267
00:26:46,496 --> 00:26:48,636
"Showcase your strength"

268
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,089
Goddess Jaganmata!

269
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,433
People all over the world worship you.

270
00:27:04,496 --> 00:27:05,589
Host carnivals in your name.

271
00:27:05,614 --> 00:27:07,480
Pray to you as you're the Ultimate Goddess.

272
00:27:07,785 --> 00:27:10,371
But, what about those who
trust you with their lives?

273
00:27:10,535 --> 00:27:11,971
Why do you have such a frightening form?

274
00:27:11,996 --> 00:27:13,879
Why do you require so many heads and arms?

275
00:27:14,871 --> 00:27:16,691
If you really are the
Goddess of the World...

276
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:18,948
why are you petrifying your devotees?

277
00:27:18,973 --> 00:27:20,457
I need an answer! Right now!

278
00:27:38,887 --> 00:27:42,089
"You holy form resides in one and all"

279
00:27:42,113 --> 00:27:45,207
"You are a manifestation of power"

280
00:27:48,434 --> 00:27:51,683
"Salutations to you, Mother!"

281
00:27:51,699 --> 00:27:55,394
"Salutations to you, Mother!"

282
00:27:55,418 --> 00:27:56,621
Hail, Goddess!

283
00:27:56,856 --> 00:27:58,371
This is your real form.

284
00:27:58,404 --> 00:27:59,793
Bless me!

285
00:28:01,074 --> 00:28:06,363
Oh, dear! It's your pure heart
that made me appear in front of you.

286
00:28:06,879 --> 00:28:09,371
I hereby bestow my grace!

287
00:28:11,637 --> 00:28:12,691
What are those, mother?

288
00:28:13,535 --> 00:28:15,613
In my right hand is, wealth.

289
00:28:16,145 --> 00:28:18,996
If you consume this, you
will become a wealthy person.

290
00:28:19,317 --> 00:28:21,418
In my left hand is, wisdom.

291
00:28:22,097 --> 00:28:24,996
If you consume this, you
will become a great pandit.

292
00:28:25,824 --> 00:28:31,480
It is upto you to choose
between wealth and wisdom.

293
00:28:49,729 --> 00:28:51,871
Do you want wisdom, son?

294
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:54,472
No, mother. I want wealth as well.

295
00:28:55,856 --> 00:28:56,824
Rama Krishna!

296
00:28:57,535 --> 00:28:58,472
What are you doing?

297
00:28:59,417 --> 00:29:00,488
Don't get furious, mother.

298
00:29:01,012 --> 00:29:03,807
I can't feed my family with wisdom alone.

299
00:29:03,832 --> 00:29:08,543
And I can't really feel
wealthy without any wisdom.

300
00:29:08,832 --> 00:29:11,207
That is why I consumed both the bowls.

301
00:29:11,324 --> 00:29:13,527
Will I become a wise
and wealthy man now?

302
00:29:14,707 --> 00:29:16,472
Most definitely, son.

303
00:29:16,652 --> 00:29:18,902
But your wealth will help others.

304
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,293
Doesn't benefit you much.

305
00:29:20,418 --> 00:29:24,246
Your wisdom will be used
for the welfare of people.

306
00:29:25,504 --> 00:29:26,789
Obstacles may be a million.

307
00:29:26,813 --> 00:29:30,027
Overcome them with intelligence
and earn glory as a witty poet.

308
00:29:33,504 --> 00:29:35,019
Did you just call me a witty poet?

309
00:29:35,089 --> 00:29:37,160
I am forever indebted to you, mother.

310
00:30:29,206 --> 00:30:31,183
Well done, Rama Krishna!

311
00:30:31,761 --> 00:30:34,597
I applaud your talent and potential.

312
00:30:35,059 --> 00:30:38,082
You are the 8th poet in
our assembly from here on.

313
00:30:38,106 --> 00:30:39,472
I feel honored, My Lord.

314
00:30:39,848 --> 00:30:41,558
I shall uphold your trust.

315
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:59,902
We hereby make it official to
the town of Vijayanagaram that...

316
00:30:59,942 --> 00:31:04,566
in our town that is renowned for
arts, righteousness and justice...

317
00:31:04,582 --> 00:31:09,050
Sri Sri Sri Tenali Rama Krishna
has been appointed as the 8th poet.

318
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:11,175
"It's a new dawn"

319
00:31:11,362 --> 00:31:13,207
"This poet's talent is being lauded"

320
00:31:13,238 --> 00:31:15,316
"Vijayanagaram is witnessing growth"

321
00:31:15,465 --> 00:31:17,441
"With the way you have risen to the top"

322
00:31:17,466 --> 00:31:19,191
"May your reputation hold forever"

323
00:31:19,223 --> 00:31:21,066
"May your inspiration live on"

324
00:31:21,293 --> 00:31:23,293
"May Tenali be honored and applauded"

325
00:31:23,379 --> 00:31:25,925
"Salutations to you!"

326
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:31,972
"He tackles questions with ease"

327
00:31:32,005 --> 00:31:34,120
"Becomes the solution to trouble"

328
00:31:34,145 --> 00:31:36,151
"Rules over the premises"

329
00:31:36,176 --> 00:31:38,277
"There's no stopping him"

330
00:31:38,324 --> 00:31:40,309
"He criticizes you before
he passes a compliment"

331
00:31:40,334 --> 00:31:42,457
"Pounces ahead like a tiger"

332
00:31:42,471 --> 00:31:44,558
"Well-versed and wise"

333
00:31:44,583 --> 00:31:46,574
"Always at His Highness' service"

334
00:31:46,599 --> 00:31:50,418
"He shall spread the wings
of glory above the Kingdom"

335
00:31:50,443 --> 00:31:52,582
"You are a scholar in literature"

336
00:31:52,606 --> 00:31:54,652
"You have become the 8th glorious poet"

337
00:31:54,683 --> 00:31:56,683
"You have eradicated injustice"

338
00:31:56,738 --> 00:32:00,027
"Salutations to you!"

339
00:32:17,949 --> 00:32:20,011
"His humor is unmatched"

340
00:32:20,043 --> 00:32:22,089
"His tactics are deceiving"

341
00:32:22,113 --> 00:32:24,199
"He has become the people's favorite"

342
00:32:24,207 --> 00:32:26,269
"He has overcome insult"

343
00:32:26,294 --> 00:32:28,363
"The Kingdom salutes you"

344
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:30,441
"You reign over the law"

345
00:32:30,466 --> 00:32:32,527
"You have won the world's hearts"

346
00:32:32,552 --> 00:32:35,402
"Salutations to you!"

347
00:33:00,363 --> 00:33:04,285
Greetings to the Emperor of Vijayanagaram,
who has great enthusiasm for arts.

348
00:33:16,731 --> 00:33:21,441
Your display of magic yesterday
has all of us mesmerized.

349
00:33:25,613 --> 00:33:30,050
Let us know what you wish from our side.

350
00:33:30,285 --> 00:33:36,160
Lord, I wish to be your Food Inspector, the
man who tests your food before you eat.

351
00:33:36,185 --> 00:33:40,488
It is in the best interest of the Kingdom
to have someone like me by your side.

352
00:33:40,504 --> 00:33:46,379
I hereby plead you to grant
me the position of your Food Inspector.

353
00:33:46,551 --> 00:33:47,496
Yes, My Lord.

354
00:33:47,621 --> 00:33:50,964
I believe his plea should be approved.

355
00:33:50,988 --> 00:33:52,332
My Lord...
-Hmm?

356
00:33:52,809 --> 00:33:55,168
Whatever your decision may be...

357
00:33:55,193 --> 00:34:00,699
it is my opinion that you should
wait until our witty poet arrives.

358
00:34:02,692 --> 00:34:06,582
He was mind-boggled and intimidated
by my display of magic yesterday.

359
00:34:06,606 --> 00:34:09,004
If he is really going to show up now...

360
00:34:09,012 --> 00:34:12,464
He better be here in the next 3 minutes.

361
00:34:12,973 --> 00:34:17,214
When the three screws
on this device snap...

362
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:18,831
the three swords here will overlap...

363
00:34:18,856 --> 00:34:23,199
making all the sand
drop in exactly 3 minutes.

364
00:34:23,223 --> 00:34:24,859
If Tenali isn't here by then...

365
00:34:24,884 --> 00:34:29,824
You should declare me as
the Food Inspector, Minister.

366
00:34:32,574 --> 00:34:35,449
That's a wonderful idea, magician.

367
00:34:36,345 --> 00:34:39,793
This shows how ridiculous
your thought process is.

368
00:34:40,043 --> 00:34:43,363
The guy you're talking about is
going to shut your mouths with his wit.

369
00:34:43,388 --> 00:34:45,677
He doesn't back off from a fight.

370
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:48,058
He will show you who's boss.

371
00:34:48,083 --> 00:34:53,314
He may be a witty poet.
But he's a tough nut to crack.

372
00:36:11,504 --> 00:36:14,129
I know that magician sent you.

373
00:36:14,293 --> 00:36:16,746
He will face the same fate, you dog!

374
00:36:46,798 --> 00:36:47,719
Alright. Alright.

375
00:36:47,899 --> 00:36:49,761
This is not a fashion show.

376
00:36:49,891 --> 00:36:52,969
Why are you late?
And why are you dressed like that?

377
00:36:52,985 --> 00:36:56,633
Master, I took a short
nap, washed my hair and...

378
00:36:56,658 --> 00:36:58,092
Stop it, I say!

379
00:36:58,649 --> 00:37:00,522
Such a sloth!

380
00:37:00,547 --> 00:37:03,412
We're at the King's service 24x7.

381
00:37:03,437 --> 00:37:05,109
We should be quick on our feet.

382
00:37:05,134 --> 00:37:09,305
We finish tomorrow's task today itself.

383
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:10,578
You know that?
-Hmm.

384
00:37:11,313 --> 00:37:12,586
Oh, is it?

385
00:37:12,743 --> 00:37:17,554
So you guys took a shower yesterday,
as you might not get the time today.

386
00:37:23,243 --> 00:37:26,063
Enough! Show the Royal Master some respect.

387
00:37:26,088 --> 00:37:28,742
Damn it! Every intelligent guy is arrogant.

388
00:37:28,759 --> 00:37:31,992
Oh! So you're also arrogant.

389
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:33,554
That I'm not.

390
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:36,563
Does that mean you're
not intelligent either?

391
00:37:45,407 --> 00:37:46,571
Silence! Silence!

392
00:37:47,774 --> 00:37:48,883
For His Highness...

393
00:37:50,281 --> 00:37:51,555
And the attendees at the assembly...

394
00:37:52,282 --> 00:37:54,328
Especially for our magician here...

395
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:57,485
[gibberish chanting]

396
00:38:11,891 --> 00:38:13,711
Good-riddance!

397
00:38:13,736 --> 00:38:15,297
Hopefully, he doesn't show up again.

398
00:38:16,063 --> 00:38:19,250
[gibberish chanting continues]

399
00:38:21,234 --> 00:38:23,196
The Act of Vanish and Appear!

400
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:26,536
To vanish from one place
and appear somewhere else...

401
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,492
by prepping everything beforehand.

402
00:38:36,766 --> 00:38:37,844
Rama Krishna...

403
00:38:37,993 --> 00:38:39,821
Where did you disappear?
How did you reappear again?

404
00:38:39,907 --> 00:38:41,696
What's with the skulls and bones?

405
00:38:41,734 --> 00:38:45,375
I went to this mystical world our
magician here is quite familiar with.

406
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:50,399
On my way back, the people there asked
me to make sure the magician got these.

407
00:38:50,424 --> 00:38:52,453
That's a senseless allegation.

408
00:38:52,478 --> 00:38:54,164
I have nothing to do with that stuff.

409
00:38:54,476 --> 00:38:55,765
I'll be right back.

410
00:39:00,992 --> 00:39:02,539
The Act of Awe!

411
00:39:02,563 --> 00:39:06,296
Pretending to make things
appear out of thin air...

412
00:39:06,321 --> 00:39:07,914
while actually having
grabbed them just then.

413
00:39:12,071 --> 00:39:15,282
Why did you bring these
half-eaten fruits, Rama Krishna?

414
00:39:15,314 --> 00:39:19,430
These are the fruits our magician
here ate in the mystical world.

415
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:24,117
But here he is, claiming to have
tasted the fruits without touching them.

416
00:39:24,142 --> 00:39:25,352
He's lying through his teeth.

417
00:39:25,368 --> 00:39:26,583
What's with this mystical world...?

418
00:39:26,607 --> 00:39:29,946
those skulls and bones...
and those half-eaten fruits?

419
00:39:29,971 --> 00:39:31,328
Those belong to you!

420
00:39:31,391 --> 00:39:33,063
I would never do that.

421
00:39:33,088 --> 00:39:35,383
Then who would?
-That parrot...

422
00:39:35,906 --> 00:39:36,742
Crap!

423
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:42,501
The Act of Manipulation!

424
00:39:42,712 --> 00:39:44,883
Diverting your attention towards me.

425
00:39:44,908 --> 00:39:46,930
Distracting your senses...

426
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:49,235
and making you say what I want you to say.

427
00:39:57,891 --> 00:39:59,860
What's with the parrot
and half-eaten fruits?

428
00:39:59,885 --> 00:40:01,485
What's up with you?

429
00:40:01,509 --> 00:40:04,321
He can't counter your question, Appaji.

430
00:40:05,071 --> 00:40:10,596
The secret lies behind
this invisible curtain.

431
00:40:14,846 --> 00:40:15,596
My Lord!

432
00:40:15,901 --> 00:40:18,322
He's been making the parrot
get around without us noticing.

433
00:40:18,339 --> 00:40:21,260
That bird is his accomplice
in all his magic tricks.

434
00:40:21,299 --> 00:40:24,915
It was his ploy to win the Food Inspector
position through this means...

435
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:28,072
and take your life eventually.

436
00:40:29,963 --> 00:40:33,768
While we're stating facts, he's the spy
for our enemies, the Bahmani Sultans.

437
00:40:37,932 --> 00:40:41,166
I got suspicious about his
manner at the assembly yesterday.

438
00:40:41,604 --> 00:40:45,033
So I thought I'd scout
this spy's camp last night.

439
00:40:45,315 --> 00:40:48,502
One letter revealed all his treachery.

440
00:41:01,393 --> 00:41:04,026
Capture this traitor in our bastille.

441
00:41:15,549 --> 00:41:16,839
I shall remember this.

442
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,471
Marvelous job, Rama Krishna.

443
00:41:31,495 --> 00:41:34,260
Your intelligence is tremendous.
-It's an honor, My Lord.

444
00:41:34,284 --> 00:41:36,174
Please accept these.

445
00:41:36,276 --> 00:41:39,619
Salutations to Rama Krishna!
-Hail! Hail!

446
00:41:39,721 --> 00:41:42,361
Salutations to Rama Krishna!
-Hail! Hail!

447
00:41:44,245 --> 00:41:49,524
Why did Rama have to
show up late to this assembly?

448
00:41:49,549 --> 00:41:53,924
Of course, to make a fool
out of you in open assembly.

449
00:42:42,628 --> 00:42:44,729
"He's a mysterious poet"

450
00:42:44,754 --> 00:42:46,736
"Quite mischievous"

451
00:42:47,003 --> 00:42:50,260
"Pandit who makes your minds boggle"

452
00:42:51,284 --> 00:42:55,651
"A player who beats your every move"

453
00:42:55,721 --> 00:42:58,963
"He's the new-age poet"

454
00:42:59,096 --> 00:43:01,135
"Tenali Rama Krishna"

455
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:03,322
"A brilliant man with guts"

456
00:43:03,503 --> 00:43:05,503
"Tenali Rama Krishna!"

457
00:43:05,667 --> 00:43:07,846
"His brain works like a computer"

458
00:43:07,871 --> 00:43:09,877
"Tenali Rama Krishna"

459
00:43:09,909 --> 00:43:12,065
"He's here to make a mark"

460
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:14,252
"Tenali Rama Krishna"

461
00:43:14,284 --> 00:43:17,237
"He might just be the 8th wonder"

462
00:44:01,330 --> 00:44:03,017
"He's highly talented"

463
00:44:03,495 --> 00:44:05,494
"Doesn't miss his target"

464
00:44:05,612 --> 00:44:09,861
"He will teach you a
lesson if you mess with him"

465
00:44:09,971 --> 00:44:12,205
"He's a cunning guy"

466
00:44:12,236 --> 00:44:14,244
"Thinks at high-speed"

467
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:18,588
"Can solve any riddle in a second"

468
00:44:18,766 --> 00:44:22,924
"He fools your senses,
making you feel stupid"

469
00:44:23,139 --> 00:44:27,412
"Exudes confidence in every way"

470
00:44:27,467 --> 00:44:29,513
"Tenali Rama Krishna!"

471
00:44:29,678 --> 00:44:31,818
"A brilliant man with guts"

472
00:44:31,873 --> 00:44:33,904
"Tenali Rama Krishna!"

473
00:44:33,929 --> 00:44:36,083
"His brain works like a computer"

474
00:44:36,216 --> 00:44:38,216
"Tenali Rama Krishna!"

475
00:44:38,248 --> 00:44:40,427
"He's here to make a mark"

476
00:44:40,623 --> 00:44:42,623
"Tenali Rama Krishna!"

477
00:44:42,756 --> 00:44:45,373
"He might just be the 8th wonder"

478
00:45:07,105 --> 00:45:10,503
Tenali and his new acquaintance Chitti...

479
00:45:10,519 --> 00:45:12,214
I want to hold them together and...

480
00:45:12,699 --> 00:45:15,440
Oh, no! Greetings, Chitti.

481
00:45:16,769 --> 00:45:18,823
"His head is a mini library"

482
00:45:19,027 --> 00:45:21,112
"You can't underestimate him"

483
00:45:21,238 --> 00:45:25,487
"Has more IQ than Einstein and Hawkings"

484
00:45:25,589 --> 00:45:27,815
"He's like a magic wand"

485
00:45:27,824 --> 00:45:29,824
"His techniques are par excellence"

486
00:45:29,988 --> 00:45:34,143
"He's a witty poet who is
dearly loved by his guru"

487
00:45:34,315 --> 00:45:38,503
"He might as well be the
role model for Chaplin"

488
00:45:38,706 --> 00:45:42,690
"He will make you laugh like Mr. Bean"

489
00:45:45,245 --> 00:45:47,245
"Tenali Rama Krishna!"

490
00:45:47,417 --> 00:45:49,464
"You are our idol"

491
00:45:49,605 --> 00:45:51,651
"Tenali Rama Krishna!"

492
00:45:51,784 --> 00:45:53,846
"You are our boss"

493
00:45:53,933 --> 00:45:55,995
"Tenali Rama Krishna!"

494
00:45:56,144 --> 00:45:58,198
"Show your swagger"

495
00:45:58,339 --> 00:46:00,346
"Tenali Rama Krishna!"

496
00:46:00,487 --> 00:46:03,721
"He might just be the 8th wonder"

497
00:46:36,331 --> 00:46:37,096
Damn it!

498
00:46:37,121 --> 00:46:38,800
How long, Skinny-Tinny?

499
00:46:38,825 --> 00:46:40,542
Neither of them showed up.

500
00:46:40,567 --> 00:46:43,323
I need to go water the plants.

501
00:46:44,558 --> 00:46:48,237
We're plotting something intense
here and you want to water the plants?

502
00:46:48,262 --> 00:46:51,145
They're on their way.
Stop annoying me.

503
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:52,714
Tell me this, Skinny-Tinny.

504
00:46:53,081 --> 00:46:56,893
I've asked you like a million times.

505
00:46:57,503 --> 00:47:02,878
The thought of Tenali makes you more
anxious than it does our grandfather.

506
00:47:02,902 --> 00:47:03,917
Why?

507
00:47:04,292 --> 00:47:08,245
What has that witty
poet done to you anyway?

508
00:47:08,838 --> 00:47:11,573
How dare you, Kanikayya!!!

509
00:47:24,096 --> 00:47:25,901
Security is weak.

510
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:27,979
Fruits in the garden are lush.

511
00:47:28,566 --> 00:47:30,495
I speak the language of rhyme.

512
00:47:30,517 --> 00:47:32,362
And I speak the language of signs.

513
00:47:33,261 --> 00:47:35,331
So you guys are here for the material.

514
00:47:35,356 --> 00:47:39,932
Flash the cash.
Take your stash.

515
00:48:24,494 --> 00:48:26,188
Here you go. Mr. Dandanadulu.

516
00:48:27,189 --> 00:48:28,595
Mallanna!
Pullanna!

517
00:48:43,916 --> 00:48:45,962
Well done, Skinny-Tinny!

518
00:48:46,278 --> 00:48:48,149
Your influence amazes me.

519
00:48:48,173 --> 00:48:50,196
Your strategy is tremendous.

520
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:53,493
Do you know why I freed you?

521
00:48:53,603 --> 00:48:55,165
'Cause he gave you loot.

522
00:48:56,150 --> 00:48:58,751
No! 'Cause you're the enemy of my enemy.

523
00:48:58,776 --> 00:49:02,056
And that makes us both friends.

524
00:49:02,486 --> 00:49:03,798
I got it, friend.

525
00:49:03,823 --> 00:49:07,126
We're expecting the
same thing from each other.

526
00:49:07,166 --> 00:49:09,806
Now watch my game plan take flight.

527
00:49:09,845 --> 00:49:11,267
Do you know what these are?

528
00:49:11,703 --> 00:49:17,123
These could ruin the life of that
witty poet Tenali Rama Krishna.

529
00:49:17,631 --> 00:49:19,420
They're

530
00:49:19,445 --> 00:49:21,123
Got it! Got it!

531
00:49:21,148 --> 00:49:25,138
Aong with this, we will be needing
the help of everyone you mentioned.

532
00:49:25,189 --> 00:49:27,021
We will put ideas in my guru's head...

533
00:49:27,048 --> 00:49:30,108
then come up with a strategy...

534
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:33,256
and put Tenali to rest once and forever.

535
00:49:45,990 --> 00:49:48,053
Fools like you are so predictable.

536
00:49:48,467 --> 00:49:53,591
I'm going to bring down the whole
Vijayanagaram Kingdom, let alone Tenali.

537
00:49:59,256 --> 00:50:01,208
Gold! Position of Power!

538
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:03,130
Alcohol of choice!

539
00:50:03,154 --> 00:50:05,154
Arabian Beauties!

540
00:50:05,638 --> 00:50:09,404
Tell us what you would like, my friend!

541
00:50:09,429 --> 00:50:10,716
Say the word!

542
00:50:13,467 --> 00:50:18,357
When 5 Bahmani Sultans
shower me with gold...

543
00:50:18,443 --> 00:50:21,552
what more could I ask for, My Lord?

544
00:50:24,576 --> 00:50:29,661
I know you're curious to know
Krishna Devaraya's royal secrets.

545
00:50:31,201 --> 00:50:35,427
I also have much more
good news from Vijayanagaram.

546
00:50:35,481 --> 00:50:38,279
Let me lay it all out for you, brothers.

547
00:50:38,685 --> 00:50:41,865
[gibberish chanting]

548
00:50:47,717 --> 00:50:49,779
Bahmani friends...

549
00:50:49,951 --> 00:50:54,950
You notice these prints here with
the help of signs Magician Ali taught?

550
00:50:56,154 --> 00:51:00,286
This symbolizes Rayalu's 50,000 soldiers!

551
00:51:00,318 --> 00:51:02,325
Hear that? 50,000 soldiers!

552
00:51:02,357 --> 00:51:05,181
What can Krishna
Rayalu do with their help...

553
00:51:05,235 --> 00:51:09,849
when we 5 Sultans will
attack with one lakh horses?

554
00:51:09,857 --> 00:51:13,407
Rayalu will find himself
in a pile of broken bones.

555
00:51:13,446 --> 00:51:15,000
A pile of broken bones!

556
00:51:15,025 --> 00:51:16,797
A pile of broken bones!

557
00:51:22,773 --> 00:51:25,772
Rayalu's army strength 3 lakhs in number.

558
00:51:25,797 --> 00:51:27,483
And ours is 5 lakhs.

559
00:51:27,508 --> 00:51:30,780
Bahmani's army strength is 5 lakhs strong.

560
00:51:30,913 --> 00:51:37,156
Every 5 Bahmani soldiers are going to chop
the heads of every 3 Vijayanagaram soldiers.

561
00:51:40,921 --> 00:51:42,569
That's true, My Lord.

562
00:51:42,788 --> 00:51:45,108
Take any aspect for example.

563
00:51:45,172 --> 00:51:47,905
Krishna Devarayalu is weaker than us.

564
00:51:47,945 --> 00:51:50,155
And that's the strength of the Bahmanis.

565
00:51:53,226 --> 00:51:59,921
Krishna Rayalu's army will only
lost 6 months in the battle against us.

566
00:52:01,812 --> 00:52:03,772
We have no reason to worry.

567
00:52:03,804 --> 00:52:07,288
Just like how kids play hide and seek,
we're going to sneak around Devarayalu.

568
00:52:07,312 --> 00:52:10,749
We just have to keep the fight up
for 6 months, my dear Emperors.

569
00:52:11,515 --> 00:52:14,507
Devarayalu will have no counter.

570
00:52:14,577 --> 00:52:16,624
Vijayanagaram will be under ruins.

571
00:52:21,921 --> 00:52:23,608
Shut up, Magician Ali!

572
00:52:27,124 --> 00:52:29,534
Devarayalu is chivalrous.

573
00:52:29,558 --> 00:52:32,171
If he manages to get hold
of one more gold coin...

574
00:52:34,530 --> 00:52:38,296
Even if Tenali Rama Krishna
finds a way to turn things around...

575
00:52:38,651 --> 00:52:40,857
Our whole strategy will backfire.

576
00:52:40,882 --> 00:52:44,335
Vijayanagaram might just
claim victory over us.

577
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:46,069
What are you going to do about that?

578
00:52:46,381 --> 00:52:49,061
Who is this Tenali guy he's talking about?

579
00:52:54,101 --> 00:52:55,991
He's a witty poet.

580
00:52:58,117 --> 00:53:01,429
No matter what deep trouble
Vijayanagaram Kingdom is in...

581
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:02,897
He's not taken aback.

582
00:53:05,944 --> 00:53:09,671
He becomes the shining light,
dispelling the dark shadows of invasion.

583
00:53:17,335 --> 00:53:22,593
But, Magician Ali is much
smarter than that witty poet.

584
00:53:22,618 --> 00:53:25,710
I've come up with a plan
to frame him as a traitor...

585
00:53:25,735 --> 00:53:28,491
by creating false evidences against him.

586
00:53:42,703 --> 00:53:45,647
Witty poet's loyalty will be
questioned in open assembly.

587
00:53:45,671 --> 00:53:48,975
Vijayanagaram Kingdom will
witness a brutal verdict.

588
00:53:49,718 --> 00:53:54,241
The accusation brought to the
notice of Vijayanagaram Royal Court is...

589
00:53:55,249 --> 00:53:57,647
One of the crucial
members of the assembly...

590
00:53:57,702 --> 00:54:03,272
is holding posssession of Bahmani currency
and some of their spying equipment.

591
00:54:03,335 --> 00:54:07,015
Mr. Thathacharyulu has listed the following
witnesses in the accusation memorandum.

592
00:54:07,367 --> 00:54:08,765
Bastille guards.

593
00:54:09,203 --> 00:54:10,069
Skinny-Tinny!

594
00:54:10,617 --> 00:54:12,663
And Garikayya.

595
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:18,241
Tenali Rama Krishna, who once
captured enemy spy Magician Ali...

596
00:54:18,303 --> 00:54:21,678
has now fallen for the temptations of
wealth and other prized possessions.

597
00:54:22,178 --> 00:54:25,249
He is accused of being Magician Ali's
accomplice in escaping from prison.

598
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:28,733
Concerned evidences have
been submitted to the Royal Court.

599
00:54:28,828 --> 00:54:32,100
Finally, two other prisoners
named Ranga and Singa...

600
00:54:32,156 --> 00:54:36,804
have witnessed Tenali Rama Krishna
and Magician Ali meet in the bastille secretly.

601
00:54:37,093 --> 00:54:39,538
They have given their statements.

602
00:54:39,765 --> 00:54:43,007
After an intense scrutiny
of the evidences at hand...

603
00:54:43,163 --> 00:54:45,828
as accusations of treachery
and betrayal have been proved...

604
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:48,296
Tenali is sentenced to
banishment from the Kingdom.

605
00:54:48,475 --> 00:54:53,584
Royal Court commands Tenali Rama Krishna
to leave the Empire grounds immediately.

606
00:54:57,781 --> 00:54:58,890
My dear Emperors...

607
00:54:58,984 --> 00:55:03,436
Just imagine the wrath of that
Kingdom without their witty poet.

608
00:55:03,461 --> 00:55:06,350
It's like a body with a severed head.

609
00:55:06,375 --> 00:55:08,108
Victory is ours!

610
00:55:08,179 --> 00:55:11,163
The fire I fuelled in
the Vijayanagaram Kingdom...

611
00:55:11,171 --> 00:55:14,203
it's going to bring the Vijayanagaram
Kingdom down to ashes.

612
00:56:15,092 --> 00:56:17,451
Rama Krishna's banishment
from the Kingdom...

613
00:56:17,490 --> 00:56:19,826
it still feels unbelievable, Appaji.

614
00:56:21,132 --> 00:56:23,651
He left in silence
despite the harsh verdict.

615
00:56:23,675 --> 00:56:25,397
And that's making me sad.

616
00:56:26,201 --> 00:56:27,248
Don't worry, Rayalu.

617
00:56:27,702 --> 00:56:29,733
If you notice the ongoing repercussions...

618
00:56:29,826 --> 00:56:34,975
I'm suspicious that someone on
the inside is tipping our enemies.

619
00:57:01,936 --> 00:57:05,701
Even the almighty cannot
save Vijayanagaram now.

620
00:57:49,092 --> 00:57:54,404
As all the Bahmani strategies have been
successfully implemented on Vijayanagaram...

621
00:57:54,679 --> 00:57:56,092
They declared war...

622
00:57:56,172 --> 00:57:59,663
and marched towards the battle
field with their army batallion.

623
00:58:28,406 --> 00:58:34,093
Rayalu came to know that their enemies
are summoning armies to fight them.

624
00:58:34,187 --> 00:58:36,523
He realized that Tenali's banishment
was no more the bigger concern.

625
00:58:36,586 --> 00:58:41,241
Protecting the Kingdom has
become the utmost priority.

626
00:58:41,336 --> 00:58:43,437
So, he prepared for war.

627
00:59:11,395 --> 00:59:14,442
On the other hand, Magician Ali, who
was plotting for the Bahmanis...

628
00:59:14,458 --> 00:59:16,233
found the right opportunity...

629
00:59:16,258 --> 00:59:20,870
let Chitti back on his side
and used one of her tips...

630
00:59:21,177 --> 00:59:25,285
and travelled towards the Nairuti
River along with his batallion.

631
00:59:30,606 --> 00:59:33,660
Though Tenali had Goddess Kalika's grace...

632
00:59:33,958 --> 00:59:38,395
he reminded himself
that nobody is beyond fate.

633
00:59:44,333 --> 00:59:46,028
He prayed to God...

634
00:59:46,083 --> 00:59:48,918
and moved in the direction
of the Keekaranya Forest.

635
01:00:22,036 --> 01:00:23,075
This is a tiger.

636
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:24,255
And that's a goat.

637
01:00:24,771 --> 01:00:26,067
Make it fast, Veerayya.

638
01:00:26,278 --> 01:00:27,848
You're taking too long.

639
01:00:28,763 --> 01:00:30,317
Don't make me anxious, Bandayya.

640
01:00:31,505 --> 01:00:33,036
Don't do that.

641
01:00:33,841 --> 01:00:37,419
If you move that, Bandayya will
swallow you right in, Veerayya.

642
01:00:37,427 --> 01:00:39,669
How do you know our names?

643
01:00:39,817 --> 01:00:41,614
You thought I'd ask you that?

644
01:00:41,926 --> 01:00:45,684
We know that you
overheard our conversation.

645
01:00:49,169 --> 01:00:52,122
Actually, it's kind of obvious,
your name. Bandayya (Fatso).

646
01:00:57,326 --> 01:00:58,841
Who are you, sir?

647
01:00:58,857 --> 01:01:00,247
What are you doing in this forest?

648
01:01:00,778 --> 01:01:02,505
I'm a wanderer just like you guys.

649
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:04,333
My name is Rama Krishna.

650
01:01:05,043 --> 01:01:06,558
Enough about me.

651
01:01:06,716 --> 01:01:08,145
Where are you guys headed?

652
01:01:08,170 --> 01:01:10,598
There's a small town across this forest.

653
01:01:10,661 --> 01:01:12,903
Bandayya is meeting his
bride prospect there tomorrow.

654
01:01:16,091 --> 01:01:18,036
We are all headed there only.

655
01:01:18,763 --> 01:01:20,036
Well... Well...

656
01:01:20,341 --> 01:01:23,583
Have you ever travelled this path before?
-Uh-huh.

657
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:25,677
We've never been here before.

658
01:01:26,443 --> 01:01:30,770
But I do know that this
forest is kind of horrifying.

659
01:01:31,005 --> 01:01:32,723
Horrifying? How is that?

660
01:01:32,748 --> 01:01:37,388
There are many stories
going around about this forest.

661
01:01:39,318 --> 01:01:40,975
Any of them horror?

662
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,232
Stop, both of you!

663
01:01:42,257 --> 01:01:45,357
I already feel petrified.

664
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:47,889
Hold on, Bandayya.

665
01:01:48,264 --> 01:01:50,717
Don't make me suspicious.

666
01:01:50,842 --> 01:01:52,404
Tell me what's here in this forest.

667
01:01:52,452 --> 01:01:54,068
Nothing really, Rama Krishna.

668
01:01:54,093 --> 01:01:57,693
Apparently, this forest
is home to a savage tribe.

669
01:01:57,913 --> 01:02:00,373
If they get hold of humans like us...

670
01:02:00,576 --> 01:02:02,803
they hunt them down and eat them.

671
01:02:02,828 --> 01:02:04,561
Did you have to mention that?

672
01:02:05,249 --> 01:02:06,256
Mm-hmm.

673
01:02:09,538 --> 01:02:12,514
I guess that tribe found us anyway.

674
01:02:12,693 --> 01:02:14,576
We're all going to be dead!

675
01:02:15,803 --> 01:02:19,193
[gibberish praying]

676
01:02:27,062 --> 01:02:29,107
Bandayya!
-Holy moly!

677
01:02:39,147 --> 01:02:42,725
Bandayya is as scared as he's fat.

678
01:02:42,873 --> 01:02:44,255
Rama Krishna!

679
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:46,647
Stop being so mischievous.

680
01:02:46,834 --> 01:02:50,037
Look at him. He's scared to death.

681
01:03:02,514 --> 01:03:03,732
Rama Krishna...

682
01:03:04,553 --> 01:03:06,217
Don't get started again.

683
01:03:06,348 --> 01:03:08,279
Trust me it's not me this time.

684
01:03:08,311 --> 01:03:11,623
'Cause even I'm hearing
some mysterious sounds.

685
01:03:45,632 --> 01:03:47,905
[gibberish singing]

686
01:03:51,992 --> 01:03:53,859
Rama Krishna! Rama Krishna!

687
01:03:54,632 --> 01:03:55,491
Look over there.

688
01:03:56,554 --> 01:04:00,374
"Butcher the meat
It's finger-licking good"

689
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:04,765
"Hail to the Tribe God!"

690
01:04:07,461 --> 01:04:09,859
"Sacrifice to Goddess Mahankali"

691
01:04:12,265 --> 01:04:14,616
"Scrumptious meal for three days"

692
01:04:17,054 --> 01:04:19,577
"It's a feast in the kitchen"

693
01:04:31,374 --> 01:04:34,374
We've found food for a whole week.

694
01:04:34,878 --> 01:04:37,483
[gibberish hailing]

695
01:04:44,124 --> 01:04:45,132
Rama Krishna!

696
01:04:45,461 --> 01:04:49,007
They're not talking about
the food we're carrying.

697
01:04:49,015 --> 01:04:49,741
Then?

698
01:04:50,116 --> 01:04:52,280
They mean to say we are their next meal.

699
01:04:53,867 --> 01:04:57,007
Stop talking and enjoy our reception.

700
01:04:57,632 --> 01:05:01,452
We shall decide how to cook you people.

701
01:05:01,718 --> 01:05:03,007
Huh? What?

702
01:05:03,148 --> 01:05:04,249
That's not happening!

703
01:05:04,422 --> 01:05:07,093
I don't have time for
your hospitality stuff.

704
01:05:07,695 --> 01:05:09,460
I need to travel really far.

705
01:05:09,485 --> 01:05:10,280
Rama Krishna!

706
01:05:10,468 --> 01:05:13,074
Rama Krishna!
-What is it, man? Why are you yelling?

707
01:05:13,098 --> 01:05:16,312
They don't literally mean
to give us a good reception.

708
01:05:16,337 --> 01:05:18,999
Whatever it is, I don't have time for it.

709
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:20,295
See you later, Danayya.

710
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:22,624
Bandayya, don't die of fear.

711
01:05:22,649 --> 01:05:25,390
Be alive so that you experience
their hospitality at least.

712
01:05:26,992 --> 01:05:29,859
Hey, frizzy head! Apply
some oil to that hair.

713
01:05:29,906 --> 01:05:33,304
Otherwise, they might mistake you for
some animal and put you in that cage.

714
01:05:41,281 --> 01:05:42,734
Forgive us.

715
01:05:42,890 --> 01:05:45,460
Even I've got no time at all.

716
01:05:46,064 --> 01:05:50,609
We will make sure to come back
and accept your reception next time.

717
01:05:50,852 --> 01:05:51,921
Okay?

718
01:05:56,578 --> 01:05:57,710
Stop! Stop!

719
01:06:01,422 --> 01:06:04,193
'Hey, frizzy head! Apply
some oil to that hair.'

720
01:06:04,218 --> 01:06:07,702
'Otherwise, they might mistake you for
some animal and put you in that cage.'

721
01:06:07,867 --> 01:06:09,859
Let me also give them one free advice.

722
01:06:13,226 --> 01:06:17,444
Hey, dumb ass! Look at your
belly and then look at mine.

723
01:06:18,172 --> 01:06:22,273
The next time I'm here, you
should a belly as big as mine.

724
01:06:22,475 --> 01:06:24,140
Got it? Huh?

725
01:06:26,101 --> 01:06:28,053
[tribal dialect]

726
01:06:38,643 --> 01:06:41,069
Bah! What's with all the murmur?

727
01:06:41,318 --> 01:06:43,476
You will scare away all the wild animals.

728
01:06:46,999 --> 01:06:48,023
Not again!

729
01:07:10,039 --> 01:07:11,187
Rama Krishna...

730
01:07:11,702 --> 01:07:14,257
What do you think they're
going to do with us now?

731
01:07:14,414 --> 01:07:16,280
Come on! They're good for nothing.

732
01:07:16,531 --> 01:07:19,218
Worst case scenario, they might kill us.

733
01:07:19,374 --> 01:07:21,421
Cook us on a hot flame...

734
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:24,280
and then relish our crunchy
meat with a side dish.

735
01:07:25,351 --> 01:07:26,234
Ah!

736
01:07:27,281 --> 01:07:29,390
[tribal dialect]

737
01:07:30,070 --> 01:07:31,304
Goddess Kalika...

738
01:07:31,329 --> 01:07:33,359
You should only save us from them.

739
01:07:35,437 --> 01:07:36,585
Rama Krishna...

740
01:07:38,086 --> 01:07:41,788
Are you wondering how
to get out of this crisis?

741
01:07:42,773 --> 01:07:45,515
The whole creation
operates by one universal law.

742
01:07:45,540 --> 01:07:47,273
'What you seek is what you get.'

743
01:07:47,390 --> 01:07:50,976
Make an honest wish and
it will manifest in reality.

744
01:07:51,929 --> 01:07:54,218
A man's determination is pretty strong.

745
01:07:54,539 --> 01:07:56,609
When you have the
conviction to do something...

746
01:07:56,765 --> 01:08:00,655
that conviction will get you out
of that situation and help you win.

747
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:22,561
Rama Krishna...

748
01:08:22,624 --> 01:08:24,882
Why is he coming to us?

749
01:08:25,241 --> 01:08:27,046
Dear guests...

750
01:08:27,233 --> 01:08:30,491
We're going to chop you off
into pieces and relish the meal.

751
01:08:34,641 --> 01:08:36,733
Feeling scared? Don't worry.

752
01:08:37,139 --> 01:08:41,350
You have one chance to save your lives.

753
01:08:42,476 --> 01:08:43,420
What's that?

754
01:08:43,702 --> 01:08:46,389
I'm a wise man.

755
01:08:46,763 --> 01:08:51,600
The most brilliant one on this planet.

756
01:08:51,772 --> 01:08:57,592
That's 'cause my intuition
works better than anyone else's.

757
01:09:06,405 --> 01:09:07,264
Listen.

758
01:09:07,718 --> 01:09:13,155
If anyone of you can prove
that you're smarter than me...

759
01:09:13,163 --> 01:09:15,077
I'm going to let you all go.

760
01:09:15,102 --> 01:09:16,397
How can we prove ourselves?

761
01:09:18,226 --> 01:09:20,655
I will pose a question.

762
01:09:20,827 --> 01:09:23,522
Any one of you can answer it...

763
01:09:23,555 --> 01:09:25,834
and I'll let you all go.

764
01:09:25,866 --> 01:09:27,374
Otherwise...

765
01:09:27,420 --> 01:09:28,553
You know what.

766
01:09:31,710 --> 01:09:32,655
We're ready!

767
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:33,522
Go ahead.

768
01:09:39,991 --> 01:09:41,522
My question is...

769
01:09:41,655 --> 01:09:43,858
What came first? Tree or seed?

770
01:09:43,952 --> 01:09:46,030
Tell me what came first.

771
01:09:49,132 --> 01:09:49,827
Alright.

772
01:09:50,233 --> 01:09:51,991
I will answer your question.

773
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:54,452
Think clearly and answer.

774
01:09:54,569 --> 01:09:58,327
'Cause do you realize
who you're answering to?

775
01:09:58,366 --> 01:10:01,881
It's the most intelligent
guy on this planet.

776
01:10:02,679 --> 01:10:03,881
Tree came first.

777
01:10:08,897 --> 01:10:11,217
You guys have lost!

778
01:10:11,428 --> 01:10:12,670
Do you know why?

779
01:10:12,999 --> 01:10:16,374
How can the tree come
first without its seed?

780
01:10:17,194 --> 01:10:19,366
Your answer is wrong!

781
01:10:21,788 --> 01:10:22,936
Don't celebrate early.

782
01:10:23,053 --> 01:10:25,499
My answer is correct.

783
01:10:27,123 --> 01:10:29,045
Can you explain how?

784
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:30,639
Yeah, sure.

785
01:10:30,968 --> 01:10:34,288
But before that, you'll have to
answer a few questions for me.

786
01:10:34,749 --> 01:10:36,053
What are those questions?

787
01:10:36,078 --> 01:10:39,928
Were you born first or
was your father born first?

788
01:10:46,670 --> 01:10:47,935
Stupid question!

789
01:10:48,608 --> 01:10:50,569
My father was only born first.

790
01:10:50,615 --> 01:10:52,116
One more question.

791
01:10:52,851 --> 01:10:56,178
Who's older? You or your father?

792
01:10:56,343 --> 01:10:58,114
You call that a question?

793
01:10:58,139 --> 01:10:59,881
Of course, my father is older.

794
01:11:01,224 --> 01:11:04,536
Does that mean the older one is born first?

795
01:11:04,694 --> 01:11:05,319
Yes.

796
01:11:05,351 --> 01:11:09,967
Now tell me who's older. Tree or seed?

797
01:11:10,561 --> 01:11:14,131
Obviously, the tree.
-Now who's born first?

798
01:11:14,342 --> 01:11:17,717
Because the tree is older to the seed...

799
01:11:17,742 --> 01:11:19,311
Tree came first.

[tribal dialect]

801
01:11:32,483 --> 01:11:35,280
How dare you mock me!

802
01:11:36,491 --> 01:11:39,092
Move them to our kitchen right away.

803
01:11:41,397 --> 01:11:42,217
Hey!

804
01:11:42,835 --> 01:11:46,241
Kill that short guy first!

[tribal dialect]

806
01:11:58,546 --> 01:11:59,842
Come on, Rama Krishna.

807
01:12:00,678 --> 01:12:02,483
You have to do something.

808
01:12:08,327 --> 01:12:10,584
"Ring goes round and round"

809
01:12:10,609 --> 01:12:12,670
"Round and round"

810
01:12:13,147 --> 01:12:14,334
What's that?

811
01:12:15,084 --> 01:12:16,678
It's a ring with super powers.

812
01:12:16,756 --> 01:12:19,311
When you hold it and say a chant...

813
01:12:19,593 --> 01:12:21,655
All our wishes come true.

01:12:21,905 --> 01:12:23,413
[tribal dialect]

815
01:12:24,835 --> 01:12:26,913
I'm going to die in some time anyway.

816
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:32,147
Before I do, I wish I could pass
on this ring to somebody else.

817
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:35,920
Why don't you give it to me?

818
01:12:35,929 --> 01:12:38,014
You better don't do that.

819
01:12:38,390 --> 01:12:41,241
There would be no
point in giving it to him.

820
01:12:41,944 --> 01:12:43,944
But if you give it to me...

821
01:12:44,155 --> 01:12:47,670
I'll kill you without causing any pain.

822
01:12:47,679 --> 01:12:48,991
How is that fair?

823
01:12:49,483 --> 01:12:52,116
I am the first one to spot that ring.

824
01:12:52,140 --> 01:12:54,140
So, I deserve to keep it.

825
01:12:56,475 --> 01:12:57,538
Alright. Alright.

826
01:12:58,530 --> 01:13:04,092
Whoever says the following chant
word to word will get this ring.

827
01:13:04,116 --> 01:13:06,014
What's the chant?

828
01:13:06,039 --> 01:13:08,194
Hold on. I'll tell you.

829
01:13:08,507 --> 01:13:10,428
The chant is...

830
01:13:11,382 --> 01:13:13,428
Burr...!!! Phat!!!

831
01:13:13,515 --> 01:13:16,444
Burr...!!! Phat!!! There. I said it.

832
01:13:17,085 --> 01:13:18,741
That ring belongs to me now!

833
01:13:23,327 --> 01:13:25,069
That's not how you say it.

834
01:13:25,476 --> 01:13:27,670
Make the sound 'Burr' from your mouth.

835
01:13:28,397 --> 01:13:33,358
But the sound 'Phat' should
come from the other guy's cheek.

836
01:13:37,420 --> 01:13:38,396
For example...

837
01:13:39,022 --> 01:13:41,077
Burr...!!! Phat!!!

838
01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:44,139
I got it.

839
01:13:44,171 --> 01:13:46,577
But I still don't get it.

840
01:13:46,796 --> 01:13:49,092
Let me show you how it's done.

841
01:13:49,117 --> 01:13:51,124
Burr...!!! Phat!!!

842
01:13:53,257 --> 01:13:55,631
Burr...!!! Phat!!!

843
01:13:56,046 --> 01:13:57,702
Burr...!!! Phat!!!

844
01:13:57,913 --> 01:13:59,967
Burr...!!! Phat!!!

845
01:14:00,842 --> 01:14:02,686
Burr...!!! Phat!!!

846

Dundappa!

847
01:14:21,116 --> 01:14:22,084
Redappa!

848
01:14:23,326 --> 01:14:25,194
What's wrong with all of you?

849
01:14:28,874 --> 01:14:31,061
Burr...!!! Phat!!!

850
01:14:36,608 --> 01:14:38,194
Burr...!!!
-Phat!!!

01:14:42,694 --> 01:14:43,928
Rama Krishna...

852
01:14:44,139 --> 01:14:46,459
You're just brilliant!

01:14:52,929 --> 01:14:54,913
Burr...!!! Phat!!!

854
01:15:02,382 --> 01:15:03,475
Holy shit!

855
01:15:03,491 --> 01:15:08,959
How can you be so dumb
when your Tribe Head is so smart?

856
01:15:09,233 --> 01:15:10,608
Master...

857
01:15:11,265 --> 01:15:13,295
Master, we've been deceived.

858
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:15,702
That shorty manipulated us.

859
01:15:15,787 --> 01:15:18,350
Shut up! If we weren't in over our heads...

860
01:15:18,686 --> 01:15:22,639
No one would've been able to deceive us.

861
01:15:23,733 --> 01:15:24,866
Hear me out, Master.

862
01:15:25,194 --> 01:15:28,858
The 'Box of Trickery' that we've
been guarding since generations...

863
01:15:28,897 --> 01:15:30,733
That shorty has stolen it.

864
01:15:31,702 --> 01:15:33,249
'Box of Trickery!' Ugh!!!

865
01:15:37,834 --> 01:15:39,686
"O' mighty Dhira!"

866
01:15:39,711 --> 01:15:41,514

"O' mighty Dhira!"

"Your courage is unparalleled"

"O' mighty Dhira!"

Rama Krishna...

880
01:16:19,944 --> 01:16:22,518
We know Magician Ali has
escaped from the bastille.

881
01:16:22,549 --> 01:16:25,670
This is the contour you've
taken from him at one point.

882
01:16:29,296 --> 01:16:31,116
The signs on it...

883
01:16:31,147 --> 01:16:34,959
They reveal the loopholes in
our Kingdom and its system.

884
01:16:35,803 --> 01:16:39,427
Details and secrets of
the funds we allot to Army.

885
01:16:39,451 --> 01:16:43,295
Magician Ali must have passed
them to our enemies already.

886
01:16:47,881 --> 01:16:51,139
Which means our Kingdom
is posed with threat.

887
01:16:51,164 --> 01:16:53,428
It's never too late, Appaji.

888
01:16:53,453 --> 01:16:55,077
Even if our enemies get hold of this...

889
01:16:55,093 --> 01:16:57,874
we will have a counter strategy.

890
01:16:59,936 --> 01:17:00,874
Rama Krishna...

891
01:17:01,077 --> 01:17:03,428
Countering our enemy's strategies...

892
01:17:03,483 --> 01:17:05,334
It's not as easy as you presume.

893
01:17:05,382 --> 01:17:06,405
Look at this.

894
01:17:07,390 --> 01:17:10,491
This is our Vijayanagaram Kingdom
that is progressing day by day.

895
01:17:10,516 --> 01:17:12,139
If our Kingdom grows in bounds...

896
01:17:12,171 --> 01:17:12,932
Bidar...

897
01:17:13,241 --> 01:17:14,003
Birar...

898
01:17:14,185 --> 01:17:14,979
Bijapur...

899
01:17:15,201 --> 01:17:16,147
Ahmad Nagar...

900
01:17:16,444 --> 01:17:17,319
Golkonda...

901
01:17:17,397 --> 01:17:20,983
These 5 Bahmani armies
will be beaten to dust.

902
01:17:21,687 --> 01:17:27,342
That is why our Bahmani enemies are eager
to defeat us before Vijayanagaram flourishes.

903
01:17:31,929 --> 01:17:34,905
We need to surpass the
Bahmanis and be quick at it.

904
01:17:34,930 --> 01:17:37,601
What can we do to make
Vijayanagaram grow rapidly, Appaji?

905
01:17:37,804 --> 01:17:40,209
We need wealth, Rama Krishna. Wealth!

906
01:17:40,444 --> 01:17:44,342
To improve our Amry forces
and solidify our security system...

907
01:17:44,390 --> 01:17:45,686
We need tons of wealth.

908
01:17:45,999 --> 01:17:47,577
And to achieve that...

909
01:17:47,607 --> 01:17:54,873
You should know the secrets of the
treasure Vidyaranya Swamy secured ages ago.

910
01:18:00,335 --> 01:18:01,491
'One final thing!'

911
01:18:01,516 --> 01:18:04,342
'That treasure will bring him death!'

912
01:18:07,951 --> 01:18:10,866
According to Vidyaranya
Swamy's instructions...

913
01:18:10,914 --> 01:18:15,709
Only someone who's selfless, determined
and chivalrous should hunt the treasure.

914
01:18:16,202 --> 01:18:18,405
To be worthy of that...

915
01:18:18,616 --> 01:18:22,475
you should lose any authority
you possess in this Kingdom.

916
01:18:25,804 --> 01:18:28,124
'Tenali is sentenced to
banishment from the Kingdom.'

917
01:18:28,194 --> 01:18:29,756
'It's the Royal Court's verdict.'

918
01:18:32,476 --> 01:18:36,108
To know the details of the grand treasure
hidden in the Kishkinda mountain...

919
01:18:36,479 --> 01:18:38,811
you must located the 'Box of Trickery'.

920
01:18:39,209 --> 01:18:44,014
It's whereabouts and properties can
be revealed only by this Copper Contour.

921
01:19:10,602 --> 01:19:11,578
Rama Krishna...

922
01:19:11,790 --> 01:19:16,302
You should apply your brilliance to
get possession of that 'Box of Trickery'.

923
01:19:17,076 --> 01:19:20,857
If you want to teach a lesson to
Magician Ali, who stole our Royal Secrets...

924
01:19:20,881 --> 01:19:22,881
or all our enemies for that matter...

925
01:19:23,045 --> 01:19:26,779
'Box of Trickery' is our only weapon.

926
01:19:43,170 --> 01:19:44,162
Rama Krishna...

927
01:19:44,201 --> 01:19:45,638
Keep your thoughts vivid.

928
01:19:45,663 --> 01:19:46,728
Decisions strong.

929
01:19:46,752 --> 01:19:48,576
Actions confidential.

930
01:19:48,709 --> 01:19:51,513
These are direct orders
from Vidyaranya Swamy.

931
01:19:53,514 --> 01:19:56,404
He held a high stance when
it came to the instructions.

932
01:19:56,771 --> 01:19:59,310
So we need to keep
this mission between us.

933
01:19:59,678 --> 01:20:04,513
Our Government or our ruler
should not be involved at any cost.

934
01:20:05,084 --> 01:20:06,318
At your command, Minister.

935
01:20:21,787 --> 01:20:24,638
[gibberish chanting]

936
01:20:29,318 --> 01:20:30,466
Oi, Tenali!

937
01:20:30,523 --> 01:20:32,373
You devised a counter strategy...

938
01:20:32,381 --> 01:20:35,209
while manipulating us
about your banishment.

939
01:20:35,248 --> 01:20:38,568
You want to claim the treasure
in the Kishkinda mountain, huh?

940
01:20:39,998 --> 01:20:44,498
How dare he assume that
nobody will expose his secrets!

941
01:20:49,084 --> 01:20:50,037
Tenali!

942
01:20:50,403 --> 01:20:57,099
I'm going to crush you under my feet
and grab the treasure from under your nose.

943
01:20:57,113 --> 01:20:58,824
Here I come, Tenali!

944
01:20:58,848 --> 01:21:01,074
Magician Ali on the go!

945
01:21:19,910 --> 01:21:20,933
Listen, Bandayya.

946
01:21:20,958 --> 01:21:23,488
You'll face constant
trouble if you come with me.

947
01:21:23,699 --> 01:21:25,003
If you wish to live...

948
01:21:25,028 --> 01:21:26,988
Rama Krishna, don't say that.

949
01:21:27,013 --> 01:21:29,269
You're the guy who saved our lives.

950
01:21:29,425 --> 01:21:31,808
Life or death, we're with you.

951
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:06,650
Meher Bhai...

952
01:22:06,767 --> 01:22:08,447
Send your soldiers forward.

953
01:22:08,907 --> 01:22:10,259
Hmm. Go!

954
01:22:44,349 --> 01:22:45,183
Go!

955
01:23:24,354 --> 01:23:26,432
Welcome, Tenali!

956
01:23:26,495 --> 01:23:27,666
Welcome!

957
01:23:28,042 --> 01:23:29,291
Welcome!

958
01:23:30,322 --> 01:23:34,924
When Vijayanagaram has you, it
doesn't need some grand treasure.

959
01:23:34,987 --> 01:23:37,073
Come on, you're being greedy!

960
01:23:38,675 --> 01:23:42,573
Find the treasure and hand it over to me.

961
01:23:43,002 --> 01:23:45,048
You want the treasure handed over?

962
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:46,690
With my own hands?

963
01:23:49,557 --> 01:23:54,362
You're a Bahmani watchdog, who feeds poison
to the enemy King for earning their favor.

964
01:23:56,604 --> 01:23:58,963
For earning the Bahmanis' favor?

965
01:24:03,175 --> 01:24:04,049
Tenali!

966
01:24:04,074 --> 01:24:08,158
Magician Ali doesn't need the
Bahmanis' favor anymore.

967
01:24:08,175 --> 01:24:10,463
I'm eying world domination.

968
01:24:10,636 --> 01:24:14,158
I want the grand treasure
that can buy me the world.

969
01:24:23,033 --> 01:24:23,775
Look over there.

970
01:24:26,034 --> 01:24:27,323
Ali Bhai!

971
01:24:31,339 --> 01:24:32,767
I love this job.

972
01:24:33,073 --> 01:24:36,557
That lady who gave birth to this man...

973
01:24:38,315 --> 01:24:41,565
I have her in my capture now.

974
01:24:42,767 --> 01:24:43,533
Mom!

975
01:24:53,386 --> 01:24:55,026
Hey, Skinny-Tinny!

976
01:25:04,237 --> 01:25:07,135
Those swords are going to
cut through your mom's throat.

977
01:25:07,159 --> 01:25:12,908
That device is going to make
you bring the treasure to me.

978
01:25:12,994 --> 01:25:14,893
It's so much fun. Let me show you!

979
01:25:14,918 --> 01:25:20,521
Look at this other sword device fitted in.

980
01:25:20,623 --> 01:25:26,802
Every 5 minutes, one of
the screws snap accordingly.

981
01:25:26,904 --> 01:25:31,040
That makes the swords tighten further.

982
01:25:31,806 --> 01:25:35,696
In exactly 20 minutes, the
swords will overlap one another.

983
01:25:35,721 --> 01:25:37,517
All the screws will fall out...

984
01:25:37,549 --> 01:25:39,563
slitting the throat apart.

985
01:25:40,916 --> 01:25:42,931
Oh, no! Oh, dear!

986
01:25:42,979 --> 01:25:46,533
I can't begin to tell you how
sad that makes me, Tenali.

987
01:25:48,885 --> 01:25:50,861
Find the treasure for your mom.

988
01:25:50,886 --> 01:25:53,041
Bring me the treasure for your mom.

989
01:25:53,104 --> 01:25:56,853
And then you can use this device...

990
01:25:57,845 --> 01:26:01,803
to dismantle the swords and save your mom.

991
01:26:01,952 --> 01:26:05,647
If you try to act smart
and mess things up...

992
01:26:05,663 --> 01:26:06,631
Look at this.

993
01:26:07,681 --> 01:26:10,857
This device not only saves your mother.

994
01:26:10,882 --> 01:26:14,150
It can just as well kill
her without any wait.

995
01:26:26,094 --> 01:26:27,313
Oh, my god!

996
01:26:27,799 --> 01:26:29,079
Even I didn't know that.

997
01:26:29,627 --> 01:26:32,634
Master has been prepping
for something so horrifying.

998
01:26:32,744 --> 01:26:34,251
What are you looking at?

999
01:26:34,322 --> 01:26:37,228
Your mom's clock is ticking.

1000
01:26:37,298 --> 01:26:38,642
Go! Hurry!

1001
01:27:29,811 --> 01:27:31,557
'Signs and gestures"

1002
01:27:31,582 --> 01:27:33,086
'Adding naughty glances'

1003
01:27:33,111 --> 01:27:34,229
'Nose ring subtracts'

1004
01:27:34,253 --> 01:27:36,528
'As Lord Shiva's half-woman form rests"

1005
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:06,176
In front of me is a puzzled path of boxes.

1006
01:28:07,724 --> 01:28:11,091
Most of those boxes are dangerous traps.

1007
01:28:13,411 --> 01:28:16,200
Only some of them are safe to step on.

1008
01:28:18,239 --> 01:28:20,333
How do I find them and cross over?

1009
01:28:20,599 --> 01:28:24,387
I should solve the first
riddle in the 'Box of Trickery'.

1010
01:29:18,722 --> 01:29:20,885
In front of me are bells.

1011
01:29:21,018 --> 01:29:22,534
Anklet bells to be precise.

1012
01:29:22,955 --> 01:29:23,612
Two.

1013
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:30,190
Signs.

1014
01:29:30,675 --> 01:29:31,510
Meaning?

1015
01:29:31,956 --> 01:29:33,494
Two hands.

1016
01:29:38,151 --> 01:29:41,050
Multiply 4 with 'naughty
glances', meaning two eyes.

1017
01:29:41,182 --> 01:29:41,936
Number eight.

1018
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:44,341
Remove one nose ring
from eight. Makes seven.

1019
01:29:44,366 --> 01:29:46,908
Goddess is to the left of Lord
Shiva's half man-half woman form.

1020
01:29:47,033 --> 01:29:49,721
Which means the 7th box on the left.

1021
01:30:00,347 --> 01:30:03,425
Friend, that was the
first warning. Hurry up!

1022
01:30:03,793 --> 01:30:07,284
I know what to do to keep my mom alive.

1023
01:30:08,612 --> 01:30:12,183
Every 7th step on the
left will help me cross over.

1024
01:30:49,902 --> 01:30:51,050
Invisible tunnel.

1025
01:30:51,917 --> 01:30:54,238
The tunnel of death has been disabled.

1026
01:30:55,223 --> 01:30:59,933
So he's officially
entering the danger zone.

1027
01:31:12,871 --> 01:31:14,339
'Cast by the Box of Trickery'

1028
01:31:14,364 --> 01:31:15,723
'Passage of Light/Dark reveals itself'

1029
01:31:27,293 --> 01:31:28,925
'Cast by the Box of Trickery'

1030
01:31:28,965 --> 01:31:30,652
'Passage of Light/Dark reveals itself'

1031
01:31:36,937 --> 01:31:38,421
'Cast by the Box of Trickery'

1032
01:31:38,446 --> 01:31:39,835
'Passage of Light/Dark reveals itself'

1033
01:31:40,304 --> 01:31:41,171
Meaning?

1034
01:31:41,679 --> 01:31:43,928
If I want to reveal the
path to the opposite side...

1035
01:31:44,468 --> 01:31:47,772
I should find the light
cast by the 'Box of Trickery'...

1036
01:31:48,035 --> 01:31:49,605
and conceal it with shadow.

1037
01:32:34,761 --> 01:32:36,800
I'm getting much closer to the treasure.

1038
01:32:38,832 --> 01:32:40,026
You're mistaken.

1039
01:32:40,050 --> 01:32:42,874
It's me that's getting
much closer to the treasure.

1040
01:32:54,632 --> 01:32:56,733
'Poisonous Passkey welcomes the other side'

1041
01:32:57,358 --> 01:32:59,358
'Passage to the treasure
lies on the verge of death'

1042
01:33:31,983 --> 01:33:34,389
'Poisonous Passkey welcomes the other side'

1043
01:33:35,351 --> 01:33:37,374
'Passsage to the treasure
lies on the verge of death'

1044
01:33:39,483 --> 01:33:40,241
Meaning...

1045
01:33:42,319 --> 01:33:45,970
If this poison tastes salty...

1046
01:33:45,995 --> 01:33:47,003
I should press the white passkey.

1047
01:33:47,378 --> 01:33:49,339
Green passkey if astringent.

1048
01:33:49,777 --> 01:33:51,308
Red passkey if spicy.

1049
01:33:51,933 --> 01:33:53,339
Blue passkey if bitter.

1050
01:33:53,933 --> 01:33:55,300
Yellow passkey if sweet.

1051
01:33:56,096 --> 01:33:57,277
Black passkey if sour.

1052
01:33:57,302 --> 01:33:59,433
If I press the right passkey...

1053
01:33:59,496 --> 01:34:00,980
I can get through the
passage to the treasure.

1054
01:34:01,012 --> 01:34:03,808
In case I press the wrong passkey...

1055
01:34:08,504 --> 01:34:09,409
Ah!!!

1056
01:34:14,574 --> 01:34:15,816
I will die!

1057
01:34:39,308 --> 01:34:41,308
Friend, it's the second warning.

1058
01:34:41,363 --> 01:34:42,620
You need to speed up.

1059
01:35:12,895 --> 01:35:13,824
Poison tastes...

1060
01:35:14,966 --> 01:35:15,840
astringent.

1061
01:37:17,364 --> 01:37:21,019
Vidyaranya Swamy, you almost
choked me to death with that poison...

1062
01:37:21,059 --> 01:37:24,713
and immediately brought
me back to life with nectar.

1063
01:37:24,738 --> 01:37:26,816
Salutations to you, Master!

1064
01:37:41,582 --> 01:37:43,012
You guys move!

1065
01:38:24,082 --> 01:38:26,269
Wow! Amazing!

1066
01:38:29,629 --> 01:38:30,473
Wow!

1067
01:38:30,723 --> 01:38:31,566
Just wow!

1068
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:33,363
So much loot!

1069
01:38:33,410 --> 01:38:37,785
I could be the Master
of the 8 poets with this.

1070
01:38:37,810 --> 01:38:39,925
[gibberish chanting]

1071
01:38:42,027 --> 01:38:44,746
Gold! Gold!

1072
01:38:45,433 --> 01:38:48,965
Tenali! I won't eat bread anymore.

1073
01:38:49,012 --> 01:38:52,588
I'll have gold for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
-Mystical Peacock!

1074
01:38:53,876 --> 01:38:55,525
Mystical Peacock!

1075
01:38:56,033 --> 01:38:57,314
Mystical Peacock!

1076
01:38:58,306 --> 01:39:01,970
Rama Krishna, as you
near the destination...

1077
01:39:02,298 --> 01:39:04,759
you'll have to sacrifice your life.

1078
01:39:04,971 --> 01:39:05,916
I thus bid adieu!

1079
01:39:22,104 --> 01:39:23,634
My friend Magician Ali...

1080
01:39:25,526 --> 01:39:27,439
You've got what you wanted, right?

1081
01:39:27,464 --> 01:39:28,955
Now let my mom go.

1082
01:39:29,213 --> 01:39:33,884
Also, if you could gift
me this golden peacock...

1083
01:39:33,939 --> 01:39:35,509
Stop right there! Back off!

1084
01:39:37,447 --> 01:39:38,838
Hey, Tenali!

1085
01:39:40,190 --> 01:39:43,916
You were a hero till the
moment you stepped in here.

1086
01:39:43,971 --> 01:39:46,345
Now you're nothing but a fool.

1087
01:39:48,048 --> 01:39:50,556
You won't get a single penny from here.

1088
01:39:50,581 --> 01:39:53,759
Well, 'cause I've decided to kill you.

1089
01:40:25,231 --> 01:40:26,309
You're the fool!

1090
01:40:26,528 --> 01:40:28,887
You're touching the Mystical Peacock.

1091
01:40:29,145 --> 01:40:32,129
This petty treasure that
you are so excited about...

1092
01:40:32,340 --> 01:40:35,395
It's going to take you
down with it in some time.

1093
01:40:45,152 --> 01:40:45,909
What?!

1094
01:40:45,949 --> 01:40:47,917
Isn't this loot real gold?

1095
01:40:47,942 --> 01:40:49,253
It's all melting down.

1096
01:40:56,730 --> 01:40:57,823
Skinny-Tinny!

1097
01:40:58,175 --> 01:40:59,401
Run!

1098
01:41:07,316 --> 01:41:08,394
It's over!

1099
01:41:08,433 --> 01:41:12,120
Magician Ali ruined my life.

1100
01:41:12,136 --> 01:41:15,144
Oh, god! I have to get out of here!

1101
01:41:21,628 --> 01:41:24,331
Your Master is dying
a horrible death inside.

1102
01:41:24,347 --> 01:41:26,979
And you guys are strolling around here?

1103
01:41:27,604 --> 01:41:29,175
Oh, really? Let's go in together then.

1104
01:41:29,200 --> 01:41:31,526
Ah! Bunch of dim-wits!

1105
01:41:31,551 --> 01:41:34,042
The cave is collapsing!

1106
01:41:34,089 --> 01:41:35,909
Let's get out of here.

1107
01:41:36,105 --> 01:41:38,354
Come on! Run!
-Run, guys!

1108
01:41:38,402 --> 01:41:39,347
Run faster!

1109
01:41:44,980 --> 01:41:48,112
Tenali! How dare you betray Magician Ali!

1110
01:41:48,855 --> 01:41:49,854
Chitti!

1111
01:41:50,027 --> 01:41:50,761
Take this!

1112
01:42:13,011 --> 01:42:14,112
Hey, Chitti!

1113
01:42:16,535 --> 01:42:19,144
You scrawny fool!

1114
01:42:19,636 --> 01:42:23,151
Our Master is

1115
01:42:24,480 --> 01:42:29,081
He's the one who sent me
to you and lured you here.

1116
01:42:29,128 --> 01:42:30,964
It's my Master Tenali!

1117
01:42:41,280 --> 01:42:42,514
'Treasure Finder!'

1118
01:42:42,921 --> 01:42:45,905
'Secret Treasure shall guard your Kingdom.'

1119
01:42:46,194 --> 01:42:49,780
'Impress the Mystical
Peacock and sacrifice your life.'

1120
01:42:53,451 --> 01:42:57,466
Even if I get through all the tough
levels in the Kishkinda mountain...

1121
01:42:57,585 --> 01:42:59,039
and reach the final stage...

1122
01:42:59,859 --> 01:43:02,898
I'd have to sacrifice my
life to the Mystical Peacock.

1123
01:43:04,656 --> 01:43:06,382
What I can't achieve when alive...

1124
01:43:07,007 --> 01:43:08,663
is worthless even if
I die and achieve it.

1125
01:43:10,005 --> 01:43:14,219
What if I sacrificed someone
else's life to the Mystical Peacock?

1126
01:43:14,814 --> 01:43:16,123
That's unreasonable.

1127
01:43:22,892 --> 01:43:24,993
I could find someone
who caused all this trouble.

1128
01:43:25,603 --> 01:43:28,634
Someone who brought up
this treasure after centuries.

1129
01:43:29,619 --> 01:43:32,657
I could sacrifice Magician Ali to the treasure.

1130
01:43:34,548 --> 01:43:36,227
I should strategize...

1131
01:43:36,470 --> 01:43:39,610
and trust a loyal
acquaintance with the task.

1132
01:43:48,985 --> 01:43:50,439
Rama! Let's go!

1133
01:43:50,673 --> 01:43:52,790
Mom, you go!
-Come on. There's no danger.

1134
01:43:52,815 --> 01:43:54,110
Come with me, mother.

1135
01:43:54,297 --> 01:43:55,962
Hey! Ugh!!!

1136
01:43:56,516 --> 01:43:58,337
Hey, you!

1137
01:43:59,994 --> 01:44:01,290
Hey, Tenali!

1138
01:44:01,315 --> 01:44:04,134
How dare you sacrifice me to the treasure!

1139
01:44:04,159 --> 01:44:06,431
I'm going to kill you!

1140
01:44:09,494 --> 01:44:10,651
Tenali!

1141
01:44:47,351 --> 01:44:48,616
Rama...

1142
01:44:51,397 --> 01:44:53,022
Rama...

1143
01:45:06,295 --> 01:45:07,459
Mother...

1144
01:45:47,436 --> 01:45:48,584
Tenali!

1145
01:45:53,093 --> 01:45:57,202
Wow! I wish we found
the secret treasure as well.

1146
01:45:57,303 --> 01:45:59,147
It would've been fantastic, Rama Krishna.

1147
01:46:00,335 --> 01:46:03,053
After following all the
instructions to the dot...

1148
01:46:03,291 --> 01:46:05,678
Secret Treasure shall show itself.

1149
01:46:23,538 --> 01:46:28,334
"Your dream has manifested
It's not a dream anymore, warrior"

1150
01:46:28,359 --> 01:46:32,452
"This treasure buried
deep in Earth is your honor"

1151
01:46:33,250 --> 01:46:38,085
"A treasure built by the
legendary Vidyaranya Swamy"

1152
01:46:38,110 --> 01:46:42,452
"This moment shall go down in history"

1153
01:46:43,054 --> 01:46:47,943
"The grand teasure has
risen from the ground"

1154
01:46:47,968 --> 01:46:52,046
"Salutations to the great
poet who rewrote history"

1155
01:46:52,843 --> 01:46:57,652
"It's the universal truth,
no fragment of imagination"

1156
01:46:57,668 --> 01:47:01,830
"It's a moment of pride
for the entire Kingdom"

1157
01:47:03,003 --> 01:47:07,510
"You're the charioteer, guiding the Empire"

1158
01:47:07,891 --> 01:47:10,851
"Your name has gone down in history"

1159
01:47:12,446 --> 01:47:17,297
"Your dream has manifested
It's not a dream anymore, warrior"

1160
01:47:17,352 --> 01:47:21,445
"This treasure buried
deep in Earth is your honor"

1161
01:47:22,594 --> 01:47:27,117
"Your mother must be
overwhelmed with pride"

1162
01:47:27,523 --> 01:47:32,031
"Your name has gone down in history"

1163
01:47:32,039 --> 01:47:36,109
"People hail you in the
honor of your achievement"

1164
01:47:36,516 --> 01:47:41,836
"Every word you've ever
penned echoes in the air"

1165
01:47:41,861 --> 01:47:46,703
"The grand teasure has
risen from the ground"

1166
01:47:46,735 --> 01:47:50,828
"Salutations to the great
poet who rewrote history"

1167
01:47:51,633 --> 01:47:56,508
"It's the universal truth,
no fragment of imagination"

1168
01:47:56,531 --> 01:48:01,913
"It's a moment of pride
for the entire Kingdom"

1169
01:48:17,477 --> 01:48:21,203
You must've guessed what followed.

1170
01:48:21,258 --> 01:48:24,632
Like they say, God has a plan of his own.

1171
01:48:24,680 --> 01:48:29,554
Bahmanis strategy didn't just fail before
the vigor of the Vijayanagaram Kingdom.

1172
01:48:29,640 --> 01:48:33,202
Bahmani Sultans had
no choice but to surrender.

1173
01:48:50,398 --> 01:48:52,874
Hail, Vijayanagaram Kingdom!

1174
01:48:53,555 --> 01:48:58,218
Rama Krishna risked his life for
the prosperity of Vijayanagaram Kingdom.

1175
01:48:58,243 --> 01:49:02,434
When Rayalu found out that it was
Tenali who found the grand treasure...

1176
01:49:02,458 --> 01:49:07,043
He gave Tenali a grand welcome,
where his heart was overflowing with joy.

1177
01:49:20,973 --> 01:49:23,988
Wathching her son claim such an honor...

1178
01:49:24,020 --> 01:49:26,840
Lakshmamma had tears of joy.

1179
01:49:29,559 --> 01:49:33,481
The bastille guard who provided
fake evidences on Tenali...

1180
01:49:33,512 --> 01:49:35,402
including Mallanna and Pullanna...

1181
01:49:35,441 --> 01:49:38,441
slowly snuck out of
there and fled the country.

1182
01:49:38,731 --> 01:49:44,449
Blood friends Ranga and Singa
also got what they deserved.

1183
01:49:44,590 --> 01:49:47,371
They were captured in the prison again.

1184
01:49:47,598 --> 01:49:51,144
Witty poet was now everywhere.

1185
01:49:51,465 --> 01:49:54,942
He was glowing like a
thousand beams of sunlight.

1186
01:49:54,973 --> 01:49:56,715
Though Thathacharyulu
applauded him publicly...

1187
01:49:56,740 --> 01:50:03,598
inside, he was plotting ways
to give Tenali a hard time.

1188
01:50:03,630 --> 01:50:06,731
Salutations to Rama Krishna!
-Hail! Hail!

1189
01:50:07,931 --> 01:50:10,199
If the Royal Minister is so depressed...

1190
01:50:10,224 --> 01:50:13,434
Imagine the wrath of his disciple.

1191
01:50:13,459 --> 01:50:19,246
Do you spot the odd man
out amongst these tribes?

1192
01:50:19,473 --> 01:50:20,973
It's none other than our own Skinny-Tinny!

1193
01:50:21,004 --> 01:50:23,184
When he was lost in the jungle...

1194
01:50:23,223 --> 01:50:26,348
he told the tribe that the 'Box of
Trickery' found its rightful owner...

1195
01:50:26,380 --> 01:50:29,660
upsetting the Tribe Head even further.

1196
01:50:30,020 --> 01:50:33,293
He challenged Rajappa that
he'd turn number 6 into 9...

1197
01:50:33,489 --> 01:50:38,313
and got pretty badly beaten
by him as that pissed him off.

1198
01:50:42,251 --> 01:50:46,759
They thought it wasn't worth it to kill
Skinny-Tinny, as he had no flesh.

1199
01:50:46,837 --> 01:50:49,319
So, they made him one of them.

1200
01:50:55,280 --> 01:50:57,343
Chitranga Chitti...

1201
01:50:57,382 --> 01:51:01,812
She was handed over the
prestige of the Kingdom.

1202
01:51:01,845 --> 01:51:05,671
Any crucial member of
the Vijayanagaram Kingdom...

1203
01:51:05,961 --> 01:51:08,765
eats their food only
after Chitti approves it.

1204
01:51:09,100 --> 01:51:13,983
That's 'cause Chitti is now the Food
Inspector of the Vijayanagaram Kingdom.

1205
01:51:17,206 --> 01:51:19,618
Bandayya, who wasn't getting married...

1206
01:51:19,649 --> 01:51:24,669
finally got wedded to Kondamma, a
woman Tenali found fit for Bandayya.

1207
01:51:24,762 --> 01:51:25,544
Dear...

1208
01:51:25,693 --> 01:51:28,348
In the 133 alliances I've been to...

1209
01:51:30,545 --> 01:51:34,083
I've never come across
such a beautiful woman.

1210
01:51:36,904 --> 01:51:43,478
Even I haven't seen such a
handsome man since I was born.

1211
01:51:45,869 --> 01:51:48,322
You know you were born for me.
-You know you were born for me.

1212
01:52:41,759 --> 01:52:44,774
Hail, Savior of the Kingdom!
-Hail! Hail!

1213
01:52:45,266 --> 01:52:48,961
Hail, mighty warrior!
-Hail! Hail!

1214
01:52:49,408 --> 01:52:53,392
Hail, chivalrous fighter!
-Hail! Hail!

1215
01:52:53,712 --> 01:52:58,587
Hail, Dhira Tenali Rama Krishna!
-Hail! Hail!
