1
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:02,333
Hey, inform him that you've left.

2
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:04,958
Can I go and light a candle
at the chapel?

3
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:06,208
Do you want to go now?

4
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:07,541
Just come with me.

5
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:08,916
Or you would miss the bus!

6
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:10,416
Call him once more.

7
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:19,041
Hello, I've left.

8
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:20,541
Did you leave?

9
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:23,458
It's raining heavily.
I can't hear anything.

10
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:24,750
I'll call you once I reach.

11
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:33,333
Do call me.

12
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:35,958
-I'll call you.
-Please close that door.

13
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:41,625
Where do you want to go?

14
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:42,708
Ticket.

15
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:45,000
Where?

16
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:47,333
Tell me when we reach Thamarassery.

17
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:48,791
I'm not familiar with these places, son.

18
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:50,583
Tell me when
we reach Thamarassery.

19
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:51,916
I'm new on this route.

20
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:56,541
Hey, girl!

21
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,958
-Where do you want to go?
-One ticket to Kozhikode.

22
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:01,500
-What?
-A ticket to Kozhikode.

23
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,250
-Don't you have change?
-No.

24
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,125
Bro, when will we reach there?

25
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:07,041
When will we reach?

26
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:08,791
I have no idea since
it is raining heavily.

27
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:09,875
Here.

28
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,500
What about the balance money?

29
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:13,958
I'll give it to you when you get down.

30
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,333
It conked off.
Damn it!

31
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:26,083
I am on a new route from today onwards.

32
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:28,166
It's raining heavily.
Yeah, I am in Wayanad.

33
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:34,416
I can't hear anything.
I'll call you later.

34
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,833
Dear, the water is coming inside.

35
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:37,166
-Pull down that shutter.
-Okay.

36
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:01,708
Hasn't it been four days
since I posted that?

37
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:03,625
Sir, whenever I rush here
and open this box,

38
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:06,583
the only thing I find here
is your love letter.

39
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,458
Why don't you just give it to me directly?

40
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:10,625
Why do you have to put it in the box?

41
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:12,250
Then label it as a "donation box",

42
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:13,750
so that no one puts letters in it.

43
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:16,750
That teacher must be bored
of reading these letters.

44
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:19,000
-Why don't you buy a mobile phone?
-Exactly.

45
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:21,208
-Aren't you going for classes now?
-Yes.

46
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:22,291
Then, please go.

47
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:27,250
Keep it carefully.

48
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:28,500
Oh, God!

49
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:30,291
Remove the suitcase carefully.

50
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:31,250
Here.

51
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:33,041
My slippers are torn.

52
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:34,333
Take it off.

53
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:35,875
What will people think?

54
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,750
Removing your slippers is
better than limping.

55
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:39,416
Hold this for a second.

56
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:48,666
-Give it to me.
-Hey!

57
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,791
Now we don't have to go
to the town for shopping.

58
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,666
Benny is opening a new textile shop.

59
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:53,583
Right.

60
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:54,791
Let it open.

61
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:57,625
And just like that, I wish
a textile shop, a movie theater,

62
00:05:57,708 --> 00:06:00,500
beauty shop, a park, a beach
and everything else should be built.

63
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:02,083
-Beach?
-Oh, sorry.

64
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:04,041
I said that out of excitement.

65
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:05,125
That's what I was thinking.

66
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:07,500
And that's how our area
will also become a town.

67
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:09,416
-Yeah, right!
-Shall we scare the priest?

68
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,000
-No.
-Praise to the Lord!

69
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:12,500
The brake doesn't work properly.
Please move aside.

70
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:17,500
-I'm tired of this.
-What?

71
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:20,833
I'm just tired of sitting at home.

72
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:21,916
Right.

73
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:24,125
Why don't we study something?

74
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,125
Great.

75
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:27,458
Didn't we decide to do nothing just
because we got tired of studying?

76
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:28,875
That's true.

77
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:31,875
Do you have any ideas?

78
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:34,666
You can go there and I will
take this path.

79
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:36,500
Great idea. Okay, bye.

80
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:37,666
Come back soon.
There's some work to do.

81
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:38,958
Yes. I'll come.

82
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,166
Isn't this done yet, Dad?

83
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:47,750
-Why do you want it to be done?
-I shouldn't have asked.

84
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:50,041
Why are you so late?

85
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,708
The jeep left by the time
I finished shopping.

86
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:01,458
Why did you throw it on my drawing?

87
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:03,375
-Give it back.
-Let it be.

88
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:05,666
-Did you get what I asked for?
-No.

89
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:07,958
-Did you forget?
-No, I couldn't find it.

90
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:10,333
Isn't this done yet?

91
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:13,250
Here. I had to search a
lot to get this color.

92
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:15,208
Take a look!

93
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:19,833
I have got the pins as well.

94
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,416
-I've kept it here.
-Okay.

95
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:23,541
This will be fine.

96
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:26,000
-Is it the same color or not?
-Almost.

97
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:27,375
You'll never be satisfied!

98
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:28,541
Get it yourself the next time.

99
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:29,833
Why are you so late?

100
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:32,291
I lost all the time looking
for that cloth.

101
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:36,791
I had noted the measurements
for Usha's blouse. Did you see it?

102
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,166
I don't know.

103
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,833
Didn't you write it in the book?

104
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:41,625
Are you sure?

105
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:43,708
I couldn't find it in the book.

106
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:46,000
I wrote it on a piece of paper.

107
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:48,416
Not this one.

108
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:50,333
This is Anju's measurements.

109
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:53,833
Please call Usha and ask.

110
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:55,666
She needs it by day after tomorrow.

111
00:07:57,875 --> 00:08:00,125
-What's her number?
-It's written on the calendar.

112
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:07,541
USHA.

113
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,041
Miss Usha, I am Jessy speaking.

114
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:16,000
We can't find the measurements
of your blouse.

115
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:17,166
<span style="style.center_1">Hello, who is this?</span>

116
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,125
This is Miss Usha's number, right?

117
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:23,208
Who?

118
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:24,833
<span style="style.center_1">Miss Usha.</span>

119
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:26,166
Who are you talking about?

120
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:31,208
Sorry, it's a wrong number.

121
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:32,375
Oh, no!

122
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:38,625
The number got disconnected.

123
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:41,291
99... 610...

124
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:44,541
465.

125
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:46,541
Damn it!

126
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:51,791
Is that Miss Usha?

127
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:57,333
<span style="style.center_1">The number you have called</span>
<span style="style.center_1">is currently busy.</span>

128
00:08:58,166 --> 00:08:59,000
The arm?

129
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:00,833
I'll tell her.

130
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:03,458
She will send a blouse
for the measurements.

131
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,625
The neck should be deep and
the arm length should be increased.

132
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:10,333
So, she's not sending a blouse
with those measurements?

133
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:12,333
This is the problem with these people.

134
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:14,833
No matter how well you stitch it,
they won't stop complaining.

135
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:17,916
And if you ever run into
them, they keep complaining.

136
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:21,500
"This is deep, that is short!"
People love complaining!

137
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:31,125
<span style="style.center_1">Did you get the measurements?</span>

138
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,000
Sorry, it was a wrong number.

139
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:34,791
I dialed six instead of five. Sorry.

140
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,291
That's okay.

141
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:38,291
Which is this place?

142
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,500
Place?
End of the world!

143
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:48,833
Get down, Mr. Murali!

144
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:53,208
Will you be there in the evening?

145
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:54,458
I'll call you and let you know.

146
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:55,666
Keep this as well.

147
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,041
Lalu, please drop her home.

148
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,125
What about me?

149
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:00,458
I'll see you in the evening.

150
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:03,041
Vijay, don't keep repeating yourself.

151
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:04,750
I'm not repeating myself, Suni.

152
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:07,625
I'm not blaming you for wearing it.
I can't bear its stench!

153
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,458
This is the stench of sweat, buddy.

154
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:11,291
The uniform of
hard workers might stink.

155
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:12,500
Suni, I think you should stay mum.

156
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:14,083
Didn't you go to play football
wearing this?

157
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:16,083
If it was Messi's jersey,
you would love it!

158
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:17,958
I would!
Messi has my respect.

159
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:19,500
-You keep this!
-Hey! Hey!

160
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:23,083
Why are you always
fighting, buddies?

161
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:24,625
Nawaz, I was asking him.

162
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:25,958
Couldn't he have washed this?

163
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:27,625
He hasn't washed his own
uniform in a long time.

164
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:29,083
Now I understood one thing.

165
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,666
-I can't even ask my friends for a favor.
-Did you hear him?

166
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:32,875
Now I'm at fault for helping him!

167
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:34,416
Stop it, Biju.

168
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,291
This can be solved over a tea.
Come on.

169
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:39,333
I just keep losing money
buying tea for you guys.

170
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:41,625
Yes!

171
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:42,583
Come, let's have a tea.

172
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:43,583
You carry on. I'll join you.

173
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:46,541
Learn from him, buddies.
He works day and night.

174
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:47,458
No hassles!

175
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:50,958
He knows more people here in six
months than we do after thirty years.

176
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:52,833
Don't sing.
Come and have tea.

177
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:55,333
Tea is not enough.
Buy lunch for us!

178
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:56,666
That's what you wish for.

179
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:58,291
-Appu, tea for three people.
-I'll give you.

180
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:00,458
Not three. Make it four!

181
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:02,333
-Make it four!
-Now that's right.

182
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:04,750
-Hey! Hey! Stop! Stop!
-What is it?

183
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:06,500
Give me 200 rupees.

184
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,750
I only have some 150 rupees, Shiva.

185
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:09,791
I don't have anything else.

186
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,416
You're troubling me early in the morning.

187
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,250
Don't create a scene on the road.
Give me what you have.

188
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:15,208
It's started!

189
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,333
Can't you understand that
I don't have enough money?

190
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:19,000
Don't make me mad in front
of all these people!

191
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:21,166
He deserves a couple of slaps.

192
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:24,333
If you wish to do it, then
give him a tight slap!

193
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:26,083
That will teach him a lesson.

194
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:28,375
You're the right person to slap him.

195
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:31,666
Nawaz, this problem cannot be
solved that easily.

196
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,416
If someone needs a beating, you
shouldn't think much before it.

197
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:35,625
You'll drink alcohol with this money.

198
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:37,291
I have enough to buy diesel.

199
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:39,333
-I'm not going to give this!
-You're lying!

200
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:41,791
-I need to buy diesel. Leave me!
-Nonsense!

201
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:44,041
Shut up!
Stop, son.

202
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:46,250
Let's go!
I'm going to buy medicines.

203
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:48,166
Get lost!
Damn it!

204
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,958
-Shall we go?
-Please get into that auto rickshaw.

205
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:05,708
Vishnu, pass a ride to us as well.

206
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:06,958
She's a poor thing.

207
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:10,208
He took all her money.
I felt bad for her.

208
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:11,708
Even we are like her.

209
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:15,125
Then I'll move aside. I'll take whatever
is left after you all go for rides.

210
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:16,833
-That will be awesome.
-I was just joking!

211
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:17,750
Hey!

212
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:20,166
-Nawaz!
-Hey, Kunjippa!

213
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,666
-Look who's here! When did you reach?
-I came a while back.

214
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,291
Really? Won't you come back later?
We should have a blast.

215
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:27,708
-We'll sort everything.
-See you later.

216
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,625
Don't stop anywhere again.
My family is calling me. Let's go!

217
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:34,875
Yes, I'm coming in ten minutes.

218
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:35,791
-Why didn't you go to the airport?
-Missed it.

219
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:39,291
Hey, didn't you tell me that you will
call me once you get ready?

220
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:40,458
He gets all his passengers
through his phone.

221
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:41,625
Sister!

222
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:43,958
<span style="style.center_1">The fashion of change!</span>

223
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:47,166
<span style="style.center_1">Benny Textiles welcomes you.</span>

224
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:50,041
<span style="style.center_1">The textile wonder in Poovaran Hill.</span>

225
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,541
<span style="style.center_1">Please pay attention.</span>

226
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:54,625
Sister!

227
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:56,500
Sister, there's a call for you.

228
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:58,541
Didn't I tell you to stick it like that?

229
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:00,208
The call got disconnected.
Here you go.

230
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:03,208
-Why did you bring it?
-Is that my fault?

231
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:06,916
Let's take a look.

232
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:08,875
Did you draw this?

233
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:10,083
It's good!

234
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:12,583
She's been working on it for a week.

235
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,208
But did you buy the new paper
I asked you to?

236
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:16,166
Get lost.

237
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:24,291
This guy's such a pain!

238
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:27,375
I wish I hadn't dialed
that wrong number!

239
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:32,916
-Who is it?
-No one.

240
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:39,166
-You kept it there?
-Everyone is here?

241
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:41,958
-Darling! Come on in!
-Is the alcohol over?

242
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:42,875
This is Vishnu.

243
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:44,458
-He is our friend.
-Take a seat, bro.

244
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:46,250
-No, you sit.
-When are you leaving?

245
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:48,625
Don't ask me such silly questions.

246
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:49,625
You know about my leave, right?

247
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:52,208
-Did your bring what I asked for?
-It's all there, Murali.

248
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:53,208
Let me open the suitcase.

249
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:54,916
We have someone to pay
the club's rent now.

250
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,375
What else do you want?

251
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:58,250
Just play already!

252
00:13:58,333 --> 00:13:59,791
Let me play.
Just keep quiet.

253
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:01,833
Murali, finish it in one go.

254
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,083
Nawaz, give it a knock.

255
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:05,333
-Should I?
-Yes.

256
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:10,166
I have been knocking for a while now.
Will you hit this one at least?

257
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,583
-There's a white one right next to it.
-I'm playing black, right?

258
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:14,791
-I know that.
-But, isn't everything black for you?

259
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:16,375
Just play!

260
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:18,541
Game over.

261
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,333
-Keep playing like that.
-Awesome!

262
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:23,375
Laugh as much as you want.
It's us who lost.

263
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,291
Pay for the tea and leave now.

264
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,833
We lost?
That's not possible.

265
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:29,000
That's what happened.

266
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:30,250
You should understand.

267
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:32,041
Even those with eyes
can't play properly.

268
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:33,541
And you're trying to show off?

269
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:34,625
Want to lose again?

270
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,041
Shut up.
I'm done losing.

271
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:39,000
-Sunil, just sit here. I'll be right back.
-Me?

272
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:40,083
Wait a minute.

273
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:42,750
I'll show you how it's done.

274
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,166
Now you're going to face a tough round.

275
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:46,416
Was it not tough enough until now?

276
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,375
We only took a few pictures.

277
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:50,833
Just check your WhatsApp.

278
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:54,750
There are pictures of the cake
cutting and the new dress.

279
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:57,875
It's still raw, girl.

280
00:14:58,583 --> 00:14:59,708
You're complaining, right?

281
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:01,083
Yeah, right.
I have better things to do!

282
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,083
My son is working hard in the Gulf.

283
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:04,916
Lower your voice.
All girls are the same.

284
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,083
Yeah, right!

285
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:07,458
Ask him about my phone.

286
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,666
Nothing.
She was asking when you're coming.

287
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,125
Oh! You changed the whole statement.

288
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:15,541
I'll tell him myself.

289
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:17,416
-Isn't that the answer?
-No.

290
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,333
-So, no one got the answer yet?
-No.

291
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:20,916
It's been quite a while.
This is not done.

292
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,875
Pick up your phone, sister.

293
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:22,958
Take it.

294
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,458
Take it with both your hands.

295
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:28,166
Sister, I want one as well.
It's quite late.

296
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:29,125
Really?

297
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:31,916
I'm that...

298
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:33,916
In the morning...

299
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:36,458
Sir, I told you that I dialed
your number by mistake.

300
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:38,333
Don't disturb me.

301
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:40,125
I understand. One...

302
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:41,458
One second.

303
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,708
Let us try to solve it.

304
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:45,666
Nothing.
Ask the question.

305
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:48,125
-What world are you in?
-Get lost. You ask.

306
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:49,833
Who becomes bigger by
standing upside down?

307
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,083
Me!

308
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:58,791
I told you to hit the red coin first.
You lost six points!

309
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,083
You also got a chance.
Why didn't you do it?

310
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:05,000
-Enough. You can't think for so long.
-Wait. Let me think.

311
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:06,458
It's an easy question.

312
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:08,375
-Do you have a clue?
-No clues for this.

313
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:09,833
This doesn't require any clues.

314
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,416
-Do you know the answer?
-Yes, I do.

315
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:14,291
-You say it.
-It's a difficult question.

316
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:16,416
It's very easy.

317
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,500
You say it. It's simple.

318
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:20,416
You will be shocked to know the answer.

319
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:22,375
-The answer is six, right?
-What?

320
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:24,000
-Six, right?
-Yes.

321
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:25,750
-It's six.
-That's right.

322
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,208
-I said that earlier.
-No, you didn't.

323
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:30,083
No, I said it, but she didn't agree.

324
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:31,625
No one answered here.

325
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:32,750
Only Jessy did.

326
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:35,375
So, six points in total for Jessy.

327
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,791
Which man can't live inside the house?

328
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,416
-Which man can't live inside the house?
-I don't know.

329
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,708
Who can't live inside the house?

330
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:54,250
-Hey, that's my money.
-Okay.

331
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:55,625
Ring the bell.

332
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:57,541
Tea is ready.

333
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:58,666
-Nawaz.
-Mr. Murali.

334
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,125
Which man can't live inside the house?

335
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:02,500
-What?
-Who can't live inside the house?

336
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:03,708
I can't live in my wife's house!

337
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:05,833
I didn't stay there even for a single
day after my wedding.

338
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:07,541
There were bed bugs!

339
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:09,833
Bed bugs are your
brothers-in-law, right?

340
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:12,166
A man who can't stay inside the house...

341
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:14,250
Did you give one to him?

342
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:16,208
Here you go.

343
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:17,625
Do you know?

344
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:19,708
Isn't it a snowman?

345
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:22,000
Hey.

346
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,875
Snowman.

347
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:34,458
Tell me.
Which man can't live inside the house?

348
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:35,916
-Think about it.
-Isn't it a snowman?

349
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,666
Yes, it's a snowman!

350
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:38,583
-Am I right?
-Yes.

351
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:39,541
You've become intelligent.

352
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,958
-Didn't you shower today?
-I didn't get time.

353
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:44,083
-Uncouth female!
-Hey! Hey!

354
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:45,791
Shut up, you girls!

355
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:47,166
God!

356
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,416
They are kids, right?
Let them play.

357
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,500
Nonsense!

358
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:51,500
Kids!

359
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:54,041
-Shall I ask you a question?
-Go ahead.

360
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:56,916
-He's drunk.
-You shut up. Bring it on.

361
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:59,250
The mustard seed has an eye.

362
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:01,583
There is a fly inside that eye!

363
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:02,791
Do you know the answer?

364
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:07,916
-Do you know?
-I warned you that you'll be stuck.

365
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,708
-The mustard seed?
-Has an eye.

366
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:14,208
There's a fly inside that eye.

367
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:17,208
-What?
-We're stuck.

368
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:21,000
Say it! I was asking simple questions.

369
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:23,125
We're in a trouble!

370
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,250
I'll show you how to end
the game in one strike.

371
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:27,666
Watch.

372
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:29,833
Murali, move your hand!

373
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:31,375
I'm going to hit it.

374
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:34,083
Biju, the game is over.
Pay for the tea.

375
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:36,875
Nawaz, the mustard seed has an eye.

376
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,375
There's a fly inside that eye.

377
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:40,625
What?

378
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:45,958
You play.

379
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,708
This is not the PSC test.
This is some other level stuff.

380
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:49,000
Do you know, Mr. Murali?

381
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:51,958
Sir.

382
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:54,125
The mustard seed has an eye.

383
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:56,166
There's a fly inside that eye.

384
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:59,125
The mustard seed has an eye.

385
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:03,333
The mustard seed has an eye.

386
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:05,583
There's a fly inside that eye.

387
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:10,250
Isn't it rosary pea?

388
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:11,333
Do you know the answer?

389
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,708
<span style="style.center_1">-The mustard seed has an eye</span>
-What is it?

390
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:17,708
<span style="style.center_1">There's a fly inside that eye</span>

391
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:18,916
Get going, Vishnu.

392
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,791
<span style="style.center_1">A fellow from Kadalundi,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Made some banana chips</span>

393
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:27,041
<span style="style.center_1">Had a bowl of toddy,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">And relished the fish fry</span>

394
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:31,250
<span style="style.center_1">He's coming, after buying a set</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Of spectacles from the market</span>

395
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:52,916
<span style="style.center_1">To see the love of his life, who has</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Kohl lined eyes and a beautiful smile</span>

396
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,250
<span style="style.center_1">Here I come</span>
<span style="style.center_1">To listen to the sweet stories</span>

397
00:19:57,333 --> 00:20:01,708
<span style="style.center_1">Slipping in the murk,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">With waves of the lake in his eyes</span>

398
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:06,041
<span style="style.center_1">He is bringing black tea,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Crossing the shores</span>

399
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:09,416
<span style="style.center_1">The story is a bit different</span>

400
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,458
Yes!

401
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:12,958
We lost because of your one move!

402
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:14,875
Game over.
I'm leaving.

403
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:15,791
<span style="style.center_1">There is no problem</span>

404
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:17,000
Murali, let's leave.

405
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,125
Keep the coins back.

406
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,125
-Switch off the lights.
-They are off, Murali.

407
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:22,416
Get lost!

408
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:24,458
You'll come to me to pay
the power bill, right?

409
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:25,791
Just pay for this month as well.

410
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,291
Kunjippa will pay the next month.

411
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:31,958
Where is he?
Just try calling him.

412
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:33,208
What's the time?

413
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:35,416
No.
He's coming.

414
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,458
Stop.

415
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:39,375
Why are you so late, Father?
It was at 10:00 a.m.

416
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:42,125
It's all right, Saramma.
The rituals were already done, right?

417
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:43,500
-That's okay.
-Right.

418
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:46,041
-Praise the Lord, Father.
-Praise the Lord!

419
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:47,750
Go inside.

420
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:48,791
Where are you going?

421
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:50,250
-Inside.
-Move aside!

422
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:51,458
-Jesus!
-Hey.

423
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:53,833
-Shall we start?
-Yes, Father.

424
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:56,125
-Saramma!
-Make it quick, Father.

425
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:57,208
Where is Benny?

426
00:20:57,916 --> 00:20:59,000
Band!

427
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:01,708
-It's done.
-Come inside, Father.

428
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:04,208
Please go inside.
Please!

429
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:07,291
-How is it?
-Very nice.

430
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,500
Move aside.

431
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:11,208
-Father, have some sweets.
-All of you, have a look.

432
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:13,708
Though it's a small shop,
it looks good.

433
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:15,000
Not bad.

434
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,750
-All of you should have it.
-Check this out.

435
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:19,541
Give them what they want.

436
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:20,583
Have a look and
take what you want.

437
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:22,333
Everyone, come and have a look.

438
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:26,125
-I'm leaving.
-Okay, Father.

439
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:29,708
-Are you leaving, Father?
-I'm in a hurry.

440
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:32,458
-Take some photos of everyone.
-Do you have another model of this one?

441
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:33,500
That's good.

442
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:34,666
Multicolored, right?

443
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:37,625
-Isn't it nice? Isn't it good?
-Didn't you see this?

444
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:39,166
I like it.

445
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:40,208
Yeah, not bad.

446
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:41,208
Isn't it nice?

447
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:42,916
Sir, come here.

448
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:44,416
What is it?

449
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,666
I told you about something.
Please ask about it.

450
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:47,791
Okay, I will do the needful.

451
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,958
-Benny, how much for this?
-300 rupees.

452
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:52,625
-300 rupees?
-It's all right if you don't have.

453
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,583
Father? Father?

454
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:56,000
300 rupees.

455
00:21:58,625 --> 00:21:59,541
Here.

456
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:00,708
Here.

457
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:02,833
There's a discount of 100 rupees.

458
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,416
It's my first sale.

459
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:07,958
You will always be blessed by the Lord.

460
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:09,125
He is a blessed man.

461
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:11,250
It will be better if all of you
cooperate as well.

462
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:13,416
-He will do well.
-Okay, bye.

463
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,041
Sweets?

464
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,583
Will the clothes lose color?

465
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:18,541
Will the clothes lose color?

466
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:20,750
Even if it loses some color,
you will get to see a new color.

467
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:23,250
Won't it be fun to
keep changing colors?

468
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:24,208
-Really?
-Yes.

469
00:22:24,291 --> 00:22:26,541
Then the people will also
keep changing colors.

470
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:27,833
That will be more fun.

471
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:29,291
Will the color change?

472
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:30,708
Are you tired of walking?

473
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:31,625
No! She's smart!

474
00:22:31,708 --> 00:22:33,625
-Isn't it quite costly?
-No.

475
00:22:33,708 --> 00:22:35,750
If you compare it to the cost
in town, then it's not much.

476
00:22:35,833 --> 00:22:37,208
It's still a bit expensive.

477
00:22:41,791 --> 00:22:42,791
<span style="style.center_1">Hello, who is this?</span>

478
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:45,458
I'm the guy who you called by mistake.

479
00:22:45,541 --> 00:22:47,041
I know! I know!

480
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:49,708
The eye of an ant.
Isn't that the answer?

481
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,791
You have sent me around 30
stupid answers including this one.

482
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:55,458
Then, do one thing.
Give me a clue.

483
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:57,875
I thought about it all night.

484
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:02,291
Call me when you get the answer.

485
00:23:02,375 --> 00:23:04,125
Don't say that! Please.
One clue!

486
00:23:04,208 --> 00:23:05,208
Okay, I'm hanging up.

487
00:23:05,583 --> 00:23:08,291
Malutty, if you don't walk,
I won't take you anywhere.

488
00:23:08,375 --> 00:23:09,375
Oh!

489
00:23:09,666 --> 00:23:11,375
So, someone else is giving you
all the answers?

490
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:13,041
Shut up.
Father will hear you.

491
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:14,375
Tell me the truth.
Who is it?

492
00:23:14,791 --> 00:23:17,166
-Father is looking at us. Keep quiet.
-Tell me who it is.

493
00:23:17,416 --> 00:23:19,416
It's no one.
Just keep quiet.

494
00:23:19,583 --> 00:23:20,583
Did you get the answer?

495
00:23:22,666 --> 00:23:24,708
Wait, Vishnu.
Let me think.

496
00:23:24,791 --> 00:23:26,958
How can a teacher not know the answer?

497
00:23:28,125 --> 00:23:29,666
Bro, are you going for the classes?

498
00:23:29,833 --> 00:23:31,958
I'm going home.

499
00:23:32,041 --> 00:23:33,583
I study at home.

500
00:23:33,666 --> 00:23:36,500
If you concentrate in class,
you can just study at home.

501
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:38,875
-Stop here.
-I will. Don't jump off.

502
00:23:38,958 --> 00:23:40,875
-Okay, thanks!
-See you.

503
00:23:40,958 --> 00:23:43,250
-I have to go to the farm.
-You carry on.

504
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:54,833
-This girl...
-Oh, God!

505
00:23:55,791 --> 00:23:56,708
Stop there!

506
00:23:56,791 --> 00:23:58,458
-Mom!
-Hey!

507
00:23:58,625 --> 00:24:00,541
-Mom! Mom!
-Stop running!

508
00:24:00,916 --> 00:24:02,666
-What is it?
-Dad...

509
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:04,208
-Dad?
-Dad, don't hit me!

510
00:24:04,291 --> 00:24:06,458
-You'll get on random guys' cycles?
-What's the matter?

511
00:24:06,541 --> 00:24:09,000
She comes from school riding
on random guys' cycles.

512
00:24:09,125 --> 00:24:10,000
Really?

513
00:24:10,083 --> 00:24:12,125
Not random guys, mom.
There was only one guy.

514
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:13,791
-You!
-Wait!

515
00:24:13,958 --> 00:24:15,833
When did this start?
Tell me!

516
00:24:15,916 --> 00:24:17,000
This is the first time, Mom.

517
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:18,708
Is this a guy who
studies in your class?

518
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:21,625
No. It's a boy who studies
in tenth class in Carmel school.

519
00:24:21,708 --> 00:24:25,833
Am I sending you to school
to get on random guys' cycles?

520
00:24:26,291 --> 00:24:28,375
I got on it because
my legs were hurting.

521
00:24:28,875 --> 00:24:31,416
I've been asking you to buy me
a cycle for so long!

522
00:24:38,916 --> 00:24:40,916
Hey! I need to tell you something.

523
00:24:41,291 --> 00:24:43,250
It's better to buy a cycle for Jenny.

524
00:24:45,541 --> 00:24:46,916
I was thinking about it.

525
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,750
The other one wants a
touchscreen phone.

526
00:24:50,958 --> 00:24:51,958
Touchscreen phone?

527
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:54,458
The phone with a camera in it.

528
00:24:55,041 --> 00:24:56,958
-Why does she need a phone with a camera?
-I don't know.

529
00:24:57,375 --> 00:24:59,041
She has one that we can
call her on, right?

530
00:24:59,125 --> 00:25:00,250
You ask her yourself.

531
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:03,458
Well, when are you
plucking the pepper?

532
00:25:04,458 --> 00:25:05,750
What do you want now?

533
00:25:06,166 --> 00:25:07,166
I don't want anything.

534
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:09,250
Will you pluck the pepper
only if I want something?

535
00:25:09,333 --> 00:25:12,375
My dad will give me what I need.
You don't need to give me anything.

536
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,041
You take care of your kids.

537
00:25:19,041 --> 00:25:21,333
Maybe because you saw it in the dark.
It's very nice.

538
00:25:21,958 --> 00:25:24,458
I liked the blue <span style="style.center_1">churidar</span>.

539
00:25:24,666 --> 00:25:25,750
That's the one I liked.

540
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:29,083
I can change it only when
I get the next ride to town.

541
00:25:29,833 --> 00:25:31,333
Keep the bill with you.

542
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:35,875
-Oh, no!
-Pull over.

543
00:25:36,208 --> 00:25:38,708
I had told you to wear your uniform
while driving.

544
00:25:43,666 --> 00:25:44,666
Where are you
coming from at this time?

545
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,791
We had gone to the town,
to buy some clothes.

546
00:25:46,958 --> 00:25:49,291
We watched a movie after
that and got late.

547
00:25:49,791 --> 00:25:50,791
They're my sisters, sir.

548
00:25:51,625 --> 00:25:52,958
-You have the papers, right?
-Yes.

549
00:25:53,708 --> 00:25:54,708
You may go then.

550
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,375
You got away because
we are with you.

551
00:25:58,458 --> 00:25:59,708
Did you see his stare?

552
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:01,708
I got scared when he put his head inside.

553
00:26:04,458 --> 00:26:06,333
We shouldn't have eaten earlier.
Now, I'm hungry.

554
00:26:06,416 --> 00:26:08,375
Why did you get so late?

555
00:26:11,416 --> 00:26:12,916
Don't you have a bathroom
inside your house?

556
00:26:13,125 --> 00:26:14,666
Why do you have
to make this place stink?

557
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:15,958
That's my habit.

558
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:18,416
Somethings should be left
the way they are.

559
00:26:22,041 --> 00:26:23,916
-Sister!
-What?

560
00:26:24,041 --> 00:26:25,916
-Come, I'll show you something.
-What is it?

561
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:27,000
Come, I'll tell you.

562
00:26:27,583 --> 00:26:29,916
Hey! Hey!
Where are you going?

563
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,541
We'll be right back, Dad.

564
00:26:31,833 --> 00:26:32,916
Where are you going, Jessy?

565
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,250
-Come, I'll show you something.
-What?

566
00:26:35,333 --> 00:26:36,166
I don't know.
Come.

567
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:37,708
Where are you running off to?

568
00:26:37,833 --> 00:26:39,500
She won't help out
with anything at home.

569
00:26:39,583 --> 00:26:40,958
Lakshmi, where are you going?

570
00:26:41,041 --> 00:26:43,291
-Whom are you rushing to?
-I'll be right back, Mom!

571
00:26:45,541 --> 00:26:46,625
Jenny, tell me what it is!

572
00:26:46,708 --> 00:26:49,041
It's not to be said.
You have to see it. Come on!

573
00:26:49,125 --> 00:26:50,625
How much more do we have to run?

574
00:26:50,708 --> 00:26:51,666
Come with me!

575
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:52,833
I lost my slippers!

576
00:26:52,916 --> 00:26:54,791
BENNY TEXTILES.

577
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:57,875
Oh, God!

578
00:27:01,708 --> 00:27:03,375
TEXTILE WONDER IN POOVARAN HILL.
BENNY TEXTILES.

579
00:27:03,458 --> 00:27:04,916
It's her photo.

580
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,958
Wow! When did this happen?

581
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,250
If they asked me for my
photo, I would've given it.

582
00:27:10,375 --> 00:27:12,291
I didn't give this to them.

583
00:27:12,375 --> 00:27:13,916
They would've asked your father.

584
00:27:14,166 --> 00:27:16,125
-Nice, right?
-Nice, right?

585
00:27:16,208 --> 00:27:17,333
Yeah, not bad.

586
00:27:18,958 --> 00:27:19,791
Come, let's go.

587
00:27:20,125 --> 00:27:21,750
This might fall during a strong wind.

588
00:27:21,833 --> 00:27:23,041
You're saying that out of jealousy.

589
00:27:23,125 --> 00:27:25,708
I'm not jealous!
I only want the best for her.

590
00:27:30,916 --> 00:27:31,916
Come on.

591
00:27:35,583 --> 00:27:36,583
Come.

592
00:27:37,625 --> 00:27:38,958
-Neha didn't come, right?
-No.

593
00:27:39,791 --> 00:27:40,791
Go ahead.

594
00:27:45,208 --> 00:27:46,541
This is your last chance.

595
00:27:46,625 --> 00:27:49,041
If you get it wrong again,
I won't answer your calls.

596
00:27:50,791 --> 00:27:52,458
This is not Vishnu.
It's his sister Revathi.

597
00:27:52,791 --> 00:27:54,833
<span style="style.center_1">Vishnu keeps talking about you.</span>

598
00:27:54,916 --> 00:27:55,916
Give it to me.

599
00:28:00,333 --> 00:28:02,333
I am Reshma.
Vishnu's elder sister.

600
00:28:02,416 --> 00:28:05,750
It's not what you think.
I dialed his number by mistake.

601
00:28:05,833 --> 00:28:08,041
<span style="style.center_1">I know. You called for the</span>
<span style="style.center_1">measurements of the blouse.</span>

602
00:28:08,125 --> 00:28:10,750
Jessy, your photo on the
billboard looks great!

603
00:28:10,833 --> 00:28:13,000
-Why don't you pose for our shop as well.
-Okay.

604
00:28:14,166 --> 00:28:16,166
Also, don't be angry with him.

605
00:28:16,916 --> 00:28:19,458
If you call him once in a
while, he'll be very happy.

606
00:28:19,666 --> 00:28:21,791
I never call him.

607
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,958
I know that you don't call him.

608
00:28:24,416 --> 00:28:26,625
I'm saying this only to
see him happy.

609
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:31,375
<span style="style.center_1">He rides the auto-rickshaw every day, for</span>
<span style="style.center_1">the two of us.</span>

610
00:28:31,458 --> 00:28:32,958
Hey! Can you give me that phone?

611
00:28:33,625 --> 00:28:35,125
We'll call you later.

612
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:36,750
Bye.

613
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,708
Maybe I should call him.

614
00:29:02,333 --> 00:29:03,541
<span style="style.center_1">Did you dial again by mistake?</span>

615
00:29:04,125 --> 00:29:05,666
No, I meant to call you, Vishnu.

616
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,833
How do you know my name?

617
00:29:08,666 --> 00:29:10,333
Not just the name, I know everything.

618
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:12,375
That's great.

619
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:13,750
Where are you now?

620
00:29:14,083 --> 00:29:15,208
<span style="style.center_1">I'm at the hospital.</span>

621
00:29:15,291 --> 00:29:16,583
Oh! What happened?

622
00:29:16,875 --> 00:29:18,791
<span style="style.center_1">You know everything, right?</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Why don't you know this?</span>

623
00:29:20,083 --> 00:29:21,916
Your sister didn't say
anything about this.

624
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
<span style="style.center_1">So, that's how you figured things out.</span>

625
00:29:24,416 --> 00:29:26,208
I didn't mean to tell you.

626
00:29:26,541 --> 00:29:29,000
Don't fight with your sister for that.

627
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:31,041
They seem to really care about you.

628
00:29:32,958 --> 00:29:34,333
-One second, Jessy.
-Just as we thought.

629
00:29:34,708 --> 00:29:36,583
-<span style="style.center_1">They've asked me to stay for two days.</span>
-<span style="style.center_1">Okay.</span>

630
00:29:37,416 --> 00:29:38,708
<span style="style.center_1">Take that as well.</span>

631
00:29:41,458 --> 00:29:44,208
-I didn't pay you!
-That's okay. You can give it later.

632
00:29:44,333 --> 00:29:46,625
-Call me if you need anything.
-Okay.

633
00:29:47,041 --> 00:29:48,041
So, tell me, Jessy.

634
00:29:48,541 --> 00:29:50,208
So, you run a free service?

635
00:29:50,333 --> 00:29:51,333
Sometimes.

636
00:29:54,916 --> 00:29:56,708
Listen, I'll call you later.

637
00:29:57,083 --> 00:29:59,041
-Are you going?
-My mother is calling me.

638
00:29:59,125 --> 00:30:00,375
Don't go like that.

639
00:30:00,666 --> 00:30:02,125
I'll call you later.

640
00:30:02,958 --> 00:30:03,958
When will you call next?

641
00:30:04,041 --> 00:30:05,333
I can't say.

642
00:30:05,458 --> 00:30:07,291
-I'll call when I feel like it.
-When will you feel like it?

643
00:30:07,375 --> 00:30:09,000
I have no idea about that.
Fine?

644
00:30:09,833 --> 00:30:10,708
Fine.

645
00:30:11,625 --> 00:30:13,041
-Okay, bye.
-Bye.

646
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:30,625
<span style="style.center_1">You are the stars of the night,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Which shine in my eyes</span>

647
00:30:30,708 --> 00:30:34,875
<span style="style.center_1">You are the spring season</span>
<span style="style.center_1">That blossom on this land</span>

648
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:39,291
<span style="style.center_1">Are you the rain that came alive,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">To spread all over my forehead?</span>

649
00:30:39,375 --> 00:30:43,541
<span style="style.center_1">Are you the story that sprouted,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Before the birds could say it?</span>

650
00:30:43,625 --> 00:30:49,166
<span style="style.center_1">Are you the rivers, the paths,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Or the new shores that the waves touch?</span>

651
00:30:53,125 --> 00:30:56,041
Sister, what about this embroidery
of the flower for the arm?

652
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:58,625
I'm old for this.

653
00:30:58,875 --> 00:30:59,875
Are you sure?

654
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:02,625
-Are you on WhatsApp?
-My phone doesn't have WhatsApp.

655
00:31:02,708 --> 00:31:05,208
Buy a phone with a camera.
It doesn't cost much now.

656
00:31:05,375 --> 00:31:06,375
Towards this side.

657
00:31:07,125 --> 00:31:07,958
Beautiful!

658
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:09,583
Lakshmi, where is my phone?

659
00:31:09,666 --> 00:31:12,708
I've told you a hundred times
not to play with my phone!

660
00:31:14,041 --> 00:31:16,041
<span style="style.center_1">The birds say...</span>

661
00:31:20,541 --> 00:31:22,083
<span style="style.center_1">The birds give warmth to each other</span>

662
00:31:22,166 --> 00:31:23,041
Oh, God!

663
00:31:23,166 --> 00:31:24,625
I am not on Facebook.

664
00:31:25,958 --> 00:31:28,000
-Well, why did you check Facebook now?
-It's because...

665
00:31:28,083 --> 00:31:29,083
-I wanted to see you.
-Do you want to see me?

666
00:31:29,208 --> 00:31:30,208
Yes, I want to.

667
00:31:30,625 --> 00:31:32,000
I want to see you in person.

668
00:31:32,083 --> 00:31:33,458
I'll see you in person.

669
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:34,750
Are you sure?

670
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,291
Vishnu, people are waiting!

671
00:31:44,375 --> 00:31:46,166
Carry on!
I'm on a call!

672
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:56,541
<span style="style.center_1">The unremovable color</span>
<span style="style.center_1">From your fingernails</span>

673
00:31:56,625 --> 00:31:58,000
Why does it cost so much?

674
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:01,500
<span style="style.center_1">It's like the butterflies in the rainfall</span>

675
00:32:01,583 --> 00:32:03,750
<span style="style.center_1">The unremovable color</span>
<span style="style.center_1">From your fingernails</span>

676
00:32:04,208 --> 00:32:05,250
Walk.

677
00:32:05,416 --> 00:32:06,416
Hey!

678
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:08,541
-Does he call daily now?
-Yes.

679
00:32:08,625 --> 00:32:09,875
He has a great voice!

680
00:32:09,958 --> 00:32:11,625
Yeah, right.
Voice doesn't matter at all!

681
00:32:12,291 --> 00:32:14,041
-Tell me.
-It's the church festival here.

682
00:32:14,125 --> 00:32:15,125
Really?

683
00:32:15,583 --> 00:32:17,166
-Can you come?
-Of course.

684
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:18,791
Will you come?

685
00:32:18,958 --> 00:32:20,250
What are you doing?

686
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,458
<span style="style.center_1">Really?</span>

687
00:32:21,541 --> 00:32:22,916
Stop it and get going.

688
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,250
Go! Get going!

689
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:25,291
It's okay.
I'll stand.

690
00:32:25,375 --> 00:32:26,500
Okay.

691
00:32:26,583 --> 00:32:27,958
<span style="style.center_1">Like the flowers blossom</span>
<span style="style.center_1">On a new plant</span>

692
00:32:28,041 --> 00:32:32,000
<span style="style.center_1">Just like the peacock spreads</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Its feathers</span>

693
00:32:32,208 --> 00:32:35,833
<span style="style.center_1">During the first rain</span>

694
00:32:35,916 --> 00:32:40,250
<span style="style.center_1">And when it is the time of the celebration</span>

695
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:45,833
<span style="style.center_1">The sky glitters with</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Uncountable stars and sparkles</span>

696
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,583
Varghese, wait a second.

697
00:32:57,791 --> 00:33:02,000
<span style="style.center_1">You are the stars of the night,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Which shine in my eyes</span>

698
00:33:02,083 --> 00:33:06,291
<span style="style.center_1">You are the spring season</span>
<span style="style.center_1">That blossom on this land</span>

699
00:33:06,375 --> 00:33:10,666
<span style="style.center_1">Are you the rain that came alive,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">To spread all over my forehead?</span>

700
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:15,000
<span style="style.center_1">Are you the story that sprouted,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Before the birds could say it?</span>

701
00:33:15,083 --> 00:33:21,500
<span style="style.center_1">Are you the rivers, the paths,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Or the new shores that the waves touch?</span>

702
00:33:25,583 --> 00:33:28,416
Why don't we make Jessy a doctor?

703
00:33:28,666 --> 00:33:29,833
That would be great!

704
00:33:30,166 --> 00:33:32,375
But she failed in her 12th class.

705
00:33:33,541 --> 00:33:34,541
Really?

706
00:33:34,958 --> 00:33:36,791
How many subjects did she fail in?

707
00:33:36,875 --> 00:33:38,000
That...

708
00:33:39,791 --> 00:33:40,791
Wow!

709
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,291
Brother!

710
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,916
Can you please come?
My mom is really ill.

711
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,208
I need to take her to the hospital.
Please come.

712
00:33:56,625 --> 00:33:58,625
Brother, please come.
There's no one else to help.

713
00:33:58,708 --> 00:34:01,250
-What happened?
-She fell down while watching TV.

714
00:34:01,333 --> 00:34:03,083
Mom, get up!

715
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,333
Get up!
Bro, please help.

716
00:34:05,416 --> 00:34:06,625
-Okay.
-Mom!

717
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,166
Mom, please get up.

718
00:34:10,375 --> 00:34:12,000
Mom, get up.

719
00:34:12,125 --> 00:34:13,708
Slowly. Be careful.

720
00:34:13,791 --> 00:34:15,083
Put that arm over your shoulder.

721
00:34:15,166 --> 00:34:17,416
Come. Be careful.

722
00:34:17,708 --> 00:34:20,125
-Which hospital?
-Government hospital.

723
00:34:20,666 --> 00:34:22,083
-It's the other way round.
-Yes.

724
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:25,750
It's okay, Mom.

725
00:34:28,291 --> 00:34:30,000
I think it will be better
if you let him decide

726
00:34:30,166 --> 00:34:31,791
if she has to be a doctor or not.

727
00:34:31,916 --> 00:34:35,333
We will go to her house
to talk about the rest tomorrow.

728
00:34:35,458 --> 00:34:37,458
-Isn't that so, Benny?
-Yes.

729
00:34:56,375 --> 00:34:57,375
Are you off to sleep?

730
00:34:58,833 --> 00:35:00,041
<span style="style.center_1">I'll call in the morning.</span>

731
00:35:00,125 --> 00:35:02,500
Sorry. I got stuck
with a hospital case.

732
00:35:03,541 --> 00:35:05,250
I was on my way there.

733
00:35:06,583 --> 00:35:07,583
Sorry.

734
00:35:07,958 --> 00:35:08,958
<span style="style.center_1">It's all right.</span>

735
00:35:09,083 --> 00:35:10,666
What did you want to tell me?

736
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:13,041
<span style="style.center_1">It's... it's nothing.</span>

737
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:14,625
Please don't say that.

738
00:35:15,375 --> 00:35:17,791
I didn't mean to.
I'm still at the hospital.

739
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:20,291
<span style="style.center_1">Okay. Everyone has their</span>
<span style="style.center_1">priorities, right?</span>

740
00:35:20,583 --> 00:35:21,416
<span style="style.center_1">I am hanging up.</span>

741
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,333
Don't be mad at me.

742
00:35:24,083 --> 00:35:25,083
Tell me what it was about.

743
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:26,833
<span style="style.center_1">I'll tell you in the morning.</span>

744
00:35:28,833 --> 00:35:29,750
Then?

745
00:35:29,916 --> 00:35:32,375
Dad asked them to come and see me.

746
00:35:34,333 --> 00:35:35,708
<span style="style.center_1">Let them come, see you and go.</span>

747
00:35:36,458 --> 00:35:38,541
<span style="style.center_1">It's our decision,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">at the end of the day, right?</span>

748
00:35:40,541 --> 00:35:41,541
<span style="style.center_1">Don't be afraid.</span>

749
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
I'm not afraid.

750
00:35:43,375 --> 00:35:44,375
<span style="style.center_1">Then?</span>

751
00:35:45,208 --> 00:35:46,250
I am tensed.

752
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:49,166
Didn't they say they're
coming in the afternoon?

753
00:35:49,833 --> 00:35:52,750
Martin just told me they'll be
coming here in sometime.

754
00:35:52,833 --> 00:35:54,041
Move that machine away.

755
00:35:56,375 --> 00:35:58,083
Hey! They've reached.

756
00:35:58,583 --> 00:35:59,875
Really? Where?

757
00:36:00,333 --> 00:36:01,958
Hey! Go and call her.

758
00:36:02,875 --> 00:36:05,166
They've reached.
Get ready quickly.

759
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:06,708
-Come!
-Why did he have to come now?

760
00:36:06,791 --> 00:36:08,416
-<span style="style.center_1">Really?</span>
-What am I supposed to do now?

761
00:36:09,291 --> 00:36:11,041
<span style="style.center_1">First of all, you need to calm down.</span>

762
00:36:12,083 --> 00:36:14,833
<span style="style.center_1">Don't worry about anything.</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Call me once they leave.</span>

763
00:36:14,916 --> 00:36:16,375
Please change this.

764
00:36:16,458 --> 00:36:17,458
Please come.

765
00:36:25,791 --> 00:36:27,500
Ma'am, come.
Come inside.

766
00:36:28,333 --> 00:36:29,333
Come in, Martin.

767
00:36:30,083 --> 00:36:31,125
Please come.

768
00:36:31,208 --> 00:36:32,208
Don't remove your shoes.

769
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:34,916
Sit down.

770
00:36:36,666 --> 00:36:37,791
Sit.

771
00:36:39,291 --> 00:36:40,916
I'll be right back.

772
00:36:42,083 --> 00:36:43,083
Come.

773
00:36:44,666 --> 00:36:45,541
Wait a minute.

774
00:36:45,625 --> 00:36:46,875
-Just a minute.
-Okay.

775
00:36:54,041 --> 00:36:56,833
Had we known that they would come early,
we could've prepared something.

776
00:36:56,916 --> 00:36:59,291
I didn't know they would
rush in like this.

777
00:36:59,375 --> 00:37:01,125
Just serve them whatever you feel like.

778
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:03,166
-Where is she?
-She's inside. I'll call her.

779
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:05,125
Okay, I'll call you.

780
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:06,666
Okay.

781
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:08,083
The groom is in a hurry.

782
00:37:08,583 --> 00:37:10,458
When he asked me if he could
use her photo on the flex,

783
00:37:10,541 --> 00:37:12,333
and when he asked me if we
should make her a doctor,

784
00:37:12,416 --> 00:37:14,500
you should've seen the
excitement on his face!

785
00:37:15,708 --> 00:37:17,875
Is there something going on
between the two of them?

786
00:37:19,041 --> 00:37:21,916
Even if they are in love, we don't
need to tell anyone about it.

787
00:37:22,291 --> 00:37:23,625
I'm going there.

788
00:37:23,791 --> 00:37:25,458
Untie that knot.

789
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:31,958
This wasn't necessary!

790
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:33,041
Come, dear.

791
00:37:36,958 --> 00:37:37,958
Mother Mary!

792
00:37:38,625 --> 00:37:39,833
Give tea to mother.

793
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:41,250
Mother?

794
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:44,750
Give it to her.

795
00:37:45,458 --> 00:37:46,458
Tea.

796
00:37:47,416 --> 00:37:48,291
Have it.

797
00:37:48,375 --> 00:37:49,583
Have it.

798
00:37:53,416 --> 00:37:54,583
Ma'am, please drink the tea.

799
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,458
I'll drink tea after I get home.

800
00:37:56,833 --> 00:37:58,208
-Mom!
-Leave me.

801
00:38:00,041 --> 00:38:01,041
Varghese!

802
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,708
There's some work in our field.

803
00:38:02,791 --> 00:38:05,333
You won't be able to do it alone.
Call some more people.

804
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:07,000
We dropped by to say that.

805
00:38:07,083 --> 00:38:08,083
Come.

806
00:38:10,791 --> 00:38:12,541
Why are you still sitting?
Get up and come!

807
00:38:17,416 --> 00:38:18,416
Thank God!

808
00:38:25,166 --> 00:38:26,708
Why were they creating a scene?

809
00:38:26,791 --> 00:38:29,541
We wouldn't even keep our
cattle in that house.

810
00:38:29,625 --> 00:38:31,500
We can forget about
looks or education!

811
00:38:31,583 --> 00:38:32,416
Is that how it works?

812
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,000
They don't even have the means to live!

813
00:38:34,208 --> 00:38:35,291
Do they, Martin?

814
00:38:35,375 --> 00:38:36,875
If you ask me...

815
00:38:38,541 --> 00:38:41,250
Try to find someone.
Even if it's expensive.

816
00:38:41,416 --> 00:38:44,083
We have to win the cup this time.
Where are you? I'll come there.

817
00:38:51,125 --> 00:38:52,541
<span style="style.center_1">What's all that noise?</span>

818
00:38:52,625 --> 00:38:54,541
People are singing here at the club.

819
00:38:54,625 --> 00:38:56,333
<span style="style.center_1">By the way, that</span>
<span style="style.center_1">alliance got canceled.</span>

820
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,666
What is this?

821
00:38:58,250 --> 00:38:59,791
So happy for a failed alliance?

822
00:38:59,916 --> 00:39:00,916
Of course!

823
00:39:01,375 --> 00:39:04,125
My mom had already said that
the guy's mother won't agree.

824
00:39:04,291 --> 00:39:05,583
I was still afraid.

825
00:39:06,458 --> 00:39:07,458
<span style="style.center_1">Fear?</span>

826
00:39:07,541 --> 00:39:08,541
I wasn't scared.

827
00:39:08,708 --> 00:39:10,208
-<span style="style.center_1">Then?</span>
-I don't know.

828
00:39:10,958 --> 00:39:11,958
<span style="style.center_1">Then?</span>

829
00:39:12,125 --> 00:39:15,041
You keep talking about
a chapel at Kozhikode, right?

830
00:39:15,125 --> 00:39:16,750
I offered to light
101 candles there.

831
00:39:17,083 --> 00:39:18,333
Who is it, Jessy?

832
00:39:19,625 --> 00:39:20,500
No one.

833
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:22,416
God! I almost got caught!

834
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:25,708
Why are you silent?

835
00:39:25,791 --> 00:39:26,875
I was thinking.

836
00:39:27,041 --> 00:39:27,916
What?

837
00:39:28,208 --> 00:39:29,041
<span style="style.center_1">Well...</span>

838
00:39:30,208 --> 00:39:33,583
If your photo has come on a
textile shop's flex board...

839
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:37,291
you must be really beautiful, right?

840
00:39:37,791 --> 00:39:38,791
<span style="style.center_1">I'm not beautiful.</span>

841
00:39:39,416 --> 00:39:43,625
I have squint eyes,
uneven teeth and a limp.

842
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:44,958
Why? Is there a problem?

843
00:39:50,333 --> 00:39:51,916
-<span style="style.center_1">Did you run away?</span>
-No.

844
00:39:53,291 --> 00:39:54,625
<span style="style.center_1">Why aren't you saying anything?</span>

845
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:55,750
Well...

846
00:39:57,541 --> 00:39:58,958
I stay in the quarters...

847
00:40:00,708 --> 00:40:02,708
and work hard day and night.

848
00:40:03,583 --> 00:40:05,750
<span style="style.center_1">It might be really difficult</span>
<span style="style.center_1">for you to live with me.</span>

849
00:40:06,791 --> 00:40:09,208
If you think about it,
isn't Benny better for you?

850
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:14,291
Vishnu, don't get me talking!

851
00:40:15,541 --> 00:40:18,583
I didn't like you because of
your wealth or appearance.

852
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:19,750
Then?

853
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,125
I know you like me.

854
00:40:23,416 --> 00:40:24,416
I also like you.

855
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
That's all.

856
00:40:26,875 --> 00:40:29,291
So, when are you coming to the chapel,
to light the candles?

857
00:40:29,541 --> 00:40:31,000
You tell me.
I can come anytime.

858
00:40:32,208 --> 00:40:33,458
So, call me when you reach Kozhikode.

859
00:40:35,083 --> 00:40:36,666
Not just the chapel.

860
00:40:37,458 --> 00:40:39,083
There are many other
things to see there.

861
00:40:39,291 --> 00:40:41,625
Then... will you show me the sea?

862
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:43,125
Why? Haven't you seen the sea?

863
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:46,541
I saw it long back
when I was in school.

864
00:40:47,666 --> 00:40:48,666
Oh, God!

865
00:40:49,375 --> 00:40:51,750
Don't mock me!
I love the sea!

866
00:40:52,458 --> 00:40:55,166
-And me?
-I told you that already, you idiot!

867
00:41:01,166 --> 00:41:02,166
Okay, I'm going.

868
00:41:02,833 --> 00:41:03,833
<span style="style.center_1">I have a ride.</span>

869
00:41:04,333 --> 00:41:06,958
-Oh, no! So, won't you call again?
-I'll call you at night.

870
00:41:07,625 --> 00:41:09,250
Give me a missed call
before you sleep.

871
00:41:12,333 --> 00:41:13,333
Bye.

872
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,416
<span style="style.center_1">Hey!</span>

873
00:41:22,541 --> 00:41:23,541
-I'll hang up.
-Okay.

874
00:41:26,916 --> 00:41:27,916
Oh, God!

875
00:41:39,208 --> 00:41:40,208
Father!

876
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:42,166
Father!

877
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:43,916
Say something.

878
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,666
Didn't you like any other girl here?

879
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:48,541
There's no one around like her.
I want to marry her.

880
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:49,958
Her father is also interested.

881
00:41:50,958 --> 00:41:54,583
Convincing your mother,
Saramma is not so easy.

882
00:41:55,416 --> 00:41:58,041
-It's a problem.
-Tell me how to solve it.

883
00:41:58,125 --> 00:41:59,125
That's what I'm also thinking.

884
00:41:59,208 --> 00:42:02,083
Do one thing.
Don't be the Father of the Church,

885
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,625
but talk to her as my father.

886
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Me?

887
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,291
On behalf of your father?

888
00:42:12,375 --> 00:42:13,375
Come.

889
00:42:14,041 --> 00:42:15,041
Hold this.

890
00:42:16,583 --> 00:42:19,166
Benny, this wedding is
not going to happen.

891
00:42:19,833 --> 00:42:22,708
Your father will not agree to
anything that Saramma doesn't like.

892
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:24,750
-Father! Don't...
-Hey!

893
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:27,958
If Philippose was alive, do you think
he would say anything more than this?

894
00:42:28,291 --> 00:42:30,500
Moreover, he was so
scared of Saramma.

895
00:42:30,583 --> 00:42:33,458
-What?
-I mean, he was so much in love with her.

896
00:42:33,791 --> 00:42:35,083
Leave that.
Now, I...

897
00:42:35,291 --> 00:42:37,125
According to Father Gabriel's opinion...

898
00:42:38,666 --> 00:42:40,458
No need, son.
Forget it.

899
00:42:41,041 --> 00:42:43,541
We don't want anything
Saramma doesn't like.

900
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,583
She has a lot of
expectations from you.

901
00:42:46,666 --> 00:42:48,625
-Poor thing.
-Okay, Father. I'm leaving.

902
00:42:49,041 --> 00:42:50,666
-Hey! My knife!
-Here.

903
00:42:51,416 --> 00:42:52,708
How old are you now?

904
00:42:53,416 --> 00:42:54,333
I'm quite old.

905
00:42:54,458 --> 00:42:55,750
What's the point?

906
00:42:56,625 --> 00:42:58,375
You're an adult now.

907
00:42:58,708 --> 00:43:02,125
You have the maturity and intelligence
to choose your likes and dislikes.

908
00:43:02,958 --> 00:43:05,458
Go and tell your mother
that you want her!

909
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:08,208
If she doesn't agree even
after that, do as you please!

910
00:43:12,708 --> 00:43:14,833
-Mom! Wait a minute.
-What is it?

911
00:43:17,083 --> 00:43:18,875
-I have to tell you something.
-What?

912
00:43:19,708 --> 00:43:21,791
No one is born with
money in hand, right?

913
00:43:22,375 --> 00:43:25,666
You keep saying that my father built
all this through his hard work.

914
00:43:25,958 --> 00:43:28,041
Did my poor father live
enough to enjoy it?

915
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:31,500
It wasn't just your father.
I also worked hard.

916
00:43:31,666 --> 00:43:35,583
People like us who hang on to our
wealth, often forget one thing.

917
00:43:35,666 --> 00:43:36,500
What is that?

918
00:43:36,583 --> 00:43:38,916
A great man was born
in a cattle shed long back.

919
00:43:39,166 --> 00:43:40,166
So?

920
00:43:40,541 --> 00:43:43,291
Marriage is something that
happens once in a lifetime.

921
00:43:43,458 --> 00:43:47,250
You should value love and care,
and not wealth or money!

922
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:49,500
She's gone.

923
00:43:51,166 --> 00:43:52,416
Martin.

924
00:43:52,583 --> 00:43:54,000
If the rich gives the poor,

925
00:43:54,083 --> 00:43:55,708
then a time will come when
the poor will become rich.

926
00:43:56,375 --> 00:43:58,875
For that, another deluge
needs to happen.

927
00:43:59,166 --> 00:44:01,625
Won't your mother get scared
if you talk like this?

928
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:05,250
This is a time when the poor don't
bother what the rich people give to them.

929
00:44:05,333 --> 00:44:06,708
Go and tell your mother what you want.

930
00:44:13,458 --> 00:44:16,916
I'm willing to marry
Varghese's daughter, Jessy!

931
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,208
Even if someone opposes me,
I will marry her.

932
00:44:19,375 --> 00:44:20,375
Now that's called courage.

933
00:44:20,458 --> 00:44:21,791
Will you get married
without my permission?

934
00:44:21,875 --> 00:44:22,708
If I have to, I will.

935
00:44:22,791 --> 00:44:24,916
-Will you?
-Don't push me down.

936
00:44:25,375 --> 00:44:28,250
After making all this wealth,
my father departed.

937
00:44:28,333 --> 00:44:29,625
Looks like he's gone crazy.

938
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,541
If he was alive, he would have agreed.

939
00:44:31,625 --> 00:44:32,875
-Sister.
-To hell with him!

940
00:44:33,083 --> 00:44:35,666
Let him be ruined.
Do whatever you want!

941
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:37,625
Don't talk like that, sister.

942
00:44:39,083 --> 00:44:40,791
What about Saramma?

943
00:44:41,041 --> 00:44:43,500
I told you, right?
Saramma agreed to it.

944
00:44:43,583 --> 00:44:46,125
Inform all your relatives
at the earliest.

945
00:44:46,416 --> 00:44:48,416
This Sunday, we'll have the engagement.

946
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:49,666
That's what he said.

947
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:50,916
Oh, God!

948
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:54,250
What are you thinking?
There's no time now.

949
00:44:54,541 --> 00:44:57,250
I always knew that Saramma
would agree.

950
00:44:57,333 --> 00:44:58,291
Right?

951
00:44:58,791 --> 00:45:01,416
-Have some more tapioca.
-That's enough!

952
00:45:01,583 --> 00:45:02,666
I can be back for food, right?

953
00:45:02,916 --> 00:45:04,583
Let me wash my hands.

954
00:45:12,083 --> 00:45:13,416
You're here.

955
00:45:13,666 --> 00:45:16,166
Everything got sorted so quickly.

956
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:18,416
They're saying that the engagement
should happen on the coming Sunday.

957
00:45:18,958 --> 00:45:20,041
Aren't you happy?

958
00:45:20,791 --> 00:45:21,791
Hold this. I'll come now.

959
00:45:24,958 --> 00:45:25,958
I'm leaving.

960
00:45:26,208 --> 00:45:27,708
We shouldn't delay anything now.

961
00:45:29,333 --> 00:45:30,958
Then, tell your parents about Vishnu.

962
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Why can't you tell them?

963
00:45:34,416 --> 00:45:36,958
How can I say that without
even seeing him once?

964
00:45:38,166 --> 00:45:39,708
What can we do now?

965
00:45:40,333 --> 00:45:41,500
I don't know.

966
00:45:45,958 --> 00:45:47,458
Jump out, kids.

967
00:45:50,416 --> 00:45:51,500
Hold this!

968
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:52,666
-Run!
-Hello?

969
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:53,916
Tell me, Jessy.

970
00:45:55,333 --> 00:45:56,291
Take it!

971
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:58,541
Why aren't you saying anything?

972
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:02,666
<span style="style.center_1">What happened?</span>

973
00:46:04,958 --> 00:46:06,125
They came again.

974
00:46:06,583 --> 00:46:07,958
The engagement has been fixed.

975
00:46:08,916 --> 00:46:10,583
They didn't even ask me.

976
00:46:11,625 --> 00:46:13,166
No one wants to know my choice.

977
00:46:14,666 --> 00:46:15,833
<span style="style.center_1">Don't worry.</span>

978
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:17,416
How can I not be worried?

979
00:46:17,625 --> 00:46:20,208
Vishnu, I'm serious.
I must meet you.

980
00:46:20,583 --> 00:46:22,125
Enough of the romancing
over the phone.

981
00:46:22,666 --> 00:46:24,000
If you want to meet me...

982
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:25,875
where will we meet?

983
00:46:28,208 --> 00:46:29,375
<span style="style.center_1">Will you come here?</span>

984
00:46:29,833 --> 00:46:30,833
I can come there.

985
00:46:31,166 --> 00:46:34,666
But won't it be a problem
if someone sees us?

986
00:46:35,166 --> 00:46:37,208
Then tell me, Vishnu.
Where can we meet?

987
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:38,666
I just want to see you.

988
00:46:39,166 --> 00:46:40,166
Well...

989
00:46:40,666 --> 00:46:41,666
All of a sudden...

990
00:46:42,416 --> 00:46:43,708
<span style="style.center_1">Why are you talking like this, Vishnu?</span>

991
00:46:44,041 --> 00:46:45,791
<span style="style.center_1">Everything happened</span>
<span style="style.center_1">all of a sudden, right?</span>

992
00:46:47,125 --> 00:46:48,375
Calm down.

993
00:46:48,708 --> 00:46:50,291
<span style="style.center_1">I don't know what to do.</span>

994
00:46:50,791 --> 00:46:53,416
Let me think and find
out a solution to this.

995
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:56,583
<span style="style.center_1">Things will happen just like</span>
<span style="style.center_1">we dreamt and wished, Jessy.</span>

996
00:46:59,625 --> 00:47:01,250
<span style="style.center_1">I'll think about it and call you back.</span>

997
00:47:03,041 --> 00:47:05,541
<span style="style.center_1">Till then you shouldn't worry,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">and be a good girl.</span>

998
00:47:06,833 --> 00:47:07,833
Okay.

999
00:47:08,666 --> 00:47:09,875
<span style="style.center_1">Shall I hang up?</span>

1000
00:47:11,291 --> 00:47:12,291
<span style="style.center_1">Okay.</span>

1001
00:47:24,791 --> 00:47:26,583
-Where are you going?
-I'm going to the chapel.

1002
00:47:26,666 --> 00:47:28,125
-Come back soon.
-Okay.

1003
00:47:49,875 --> 00:47:51,916
Why are you still hanging
on to that, Jessy?

1004
00:47:52,083 --> 00:47:53,083
You're crazy!

1005
00:47:55,666 --> 00:47:56,500
Yes.

1006
00:47:56,916 --> 00:47:57,916
I am crazy.

1007
00:48:00,666 --> 00:48:03,041
You know what? I don't sleep
without listening to his voice.

1008
00:48:07,125 --> 00:48:08,375
Do as you please!

1009
00:48:10,958 --> 00:48:12,500
If we go now, we can
come back tomorrow.

1010
00:48:12,708 --> 00:48:14,416
I've called Babu and arranged the tickets.

1011
00:48:14,583 --> 00:48:16,541
I don't think we can go everywhere.

1012
00:48:16,625 --> 00:48:18,125
It's okay. We can call the
others for the wedding.

1013
00:48:18,208 --> 00:48:20,875
Finally, they'll complain that
they won't come to the wedding,

1014
00:48:20,958 --> 00:48:22,666
since they weren't invited
for the engagement.

1015
00:48:22,916 --> 00:48:24,916
A phone call should do, actually.

1016
00:48:25,375 --> 00:48:28,708
Some people won't come if
we invite them over the phone.

1017
00:48:28,791 --> 00:48:31,166
But we should invite everyone.
Let them all come and see.

1018
00:48:31,416 --> 00:48:33,458
-There are many jealous people.
-That's true.

1019
00:48:33,583 --> 00:48:35,125
Especially your relatives.

1020
00:48:35,208 --> 00:48:36,500
-Did you say something?
-Nothing.

1021
00:48:36,583 --> 00:48:37,750
Let's leave quickly.

1022
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:41,291
-Mom, will we come back tomorrow?
-Of course.

1023
00:48:41,375 --> 00:48:43,500
-Where is she?
-She's not coming.

1024
00:48:43,583 --> 00:48:45,166
What do you mean?

1025
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:47,166
Jessy! Are you not coming?

1026
00:48:47,416 --> 00:48:48,500
What do you mean?

1027
00:48:48,833 --> 00:48:51,125
I'm not coming, Dad.
I'm not feeling well.

1028
00:48:51,458 --> 00:48:53,375
You carry on.
I don't want to travel so much.

1029
00:48:53,541 --> 00:48:54,750
Will you stay here alone?

1030
00:48:54,833 --> 00:48:55,791
She must not be well.

1031
00:48:55,875 --> 00:48:57,375
Then let Jenny stay with her.

1032
00:48:57,541 --> 00:48:59,500
-She can go to school.
-No! I want to come!

1033
00:48:59,583 --> 00:49:01,291
I want to see Chinnu and Puppy.

1034
00:49:01,416 --> 00:49:04,541
-I rarely get to see them.
-I'll stay with Lakshmi. It's okay.

1035
00:49:04,625 --> 00:49:07,208
-Then it's fine. Let's go.
-Come on.

1036
00:49:07,833 --> 00:49:09,583
We have to go in person, right?

1037
00:49:10,125 --> 00:49:12,208
Let her go there or
Lakshmi can come here.

1038
00:49:12,291 --> 00:49:13,791
Okay.
Come on, walk.

1039
00:49:14,208 --> 00:49:15,208
Hold this.

1040
00:49:16,958 --> 00:49:19,083
Had we told Benny, he
would've hired a car for us.

1041
00:49:19,416 --> 00:49:21,041
-You should've told him.
-Yeah, right!

1042
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:24,166
If we had told him,
he would have brought his quota here.

1043
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:25,750
-What?
-Walk!

1044
00:49:26,583 --> 00:49:29,541
He hasn't even got engaged to her
and you're already demanding things.

1045
00:49:32,625 --> 00:49:35,166
-I haven't told him.
-Did you cook something?

1046
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:37,125
No. Lakshmi is here.

1047
00:49:37,333 --> 00:49:38,583
I'll call you later.

1048
00:49:38,791 --> 00:49:39,791
Come.

1049
00:49:55,666 --> 00:49:56,666
Is that enough?

1050
00:49:57,708 --> 00:49:59,708
This is all I've brought now.
Please adjust!

1051
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:05,625
-Do you want pickle?
-No.

1052
00:50:07,916 --> 00:50:09,541
I'm going to Kozhikode tomorrow.

1053
00:50:10,541 --> 00:50:12,333
Kozhikode? Why?

1054
00:50:13,958 --> 00:50:15,208
Did he say he'll come there?

1055
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:18,458
Jessy, why didn't you
tell me earlier?

1056
00:50:19,541 --> 00:50:21,000
What will I tell my mother?

1057
00:50:26,083 --> 00:50:27,083
Did you sleep?

1058
00:50:27,416 --> 00:50:28,958
No, I was just about to.

1059
00:50:29,666 --> 00:50:31,166
I don't think I will be able to sleep.

1060
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:33,916
Hey! I will leave at 6:00 a.m.

1061
00:50:34,375 --> 00:50:35,625
Don't be late.

1062
00:50:36,833 --> 00:50:39,166
-At the bus stand, right?
-Bus stand! Yes.

1063
00:50:39,416 --> 00:50:41,750
-You wait there.
-Okay, I will wait there.

1064
00:50:42,583 --> 00:50:44,333
-Come and sleep. It is quite late.
-Wait.

1065
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:46,250
-You have to leave in the morning!
-I'm coming.

1066
00:50:46,458 --> 00:50:48,875
I'll call you when I'm leaving.

1067
00:50:48,958 --> 00:50:51,708
Yeah, call me in the morning.
I know when the bus would reach.

1068
00:50:51,833 --> 00:50:54,000
-I'll be there.
-Okay.

1069
00:50:58,250 --> 00:51:01,125
She's up all night talking to the guy
she's going to meet in the morning!

1070
00:51:03,375 --> 00:51:05,333
Jessy, are you going
to sleep or not?

1071
00:51:07,791 --> 00:51:09,041
Didn't you shower today as well?

1072
00:51:09,541 --> 00:51:11,333
At least today, you should've showered.

1073
00:51:11,416 --> 00:51:13,875
It's so cold. Don't you
have anything else to ask?

1074
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:15,916
Wake me up at 5:00 a.m.

1075
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,833
It's almost 5:00 a.m.
Please go to sleep.

1076
00:51:18,375 --> 00:51:19,375
Oh, God!

1077
00:51:25,666 --> 00:51:27,833
-Give me the keys.
-Here.

1078
00:51:28,916 --> 00:51:30,583
Call him and tell him that you're leaving.

1079
00:51:37,541 --> 00:51:40,791
-Hello, I can't hear you, I'm driving.
-Hello, I've left.

1080
00:51:41,166 --> 00:51:42,166
Have you left?

1081
00:51:43,958 --> 00:51:45,666
It's raining heavily.
I can't hear you.

1082
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:46,666
I'll call you when I reach.

1083
00:51:46,791 --> 00:51:47,791
I'll call you back.

1084
00:51:51,625 --> 00:51:53,500
-Call me when you reach there.
-I will.

1085
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:56,750
You must call.

1086
00:51:57,041 --> 00:51:57,916
I will.

1087
00:51:58,416 --> 00:51:59,333
Close that door, please.

1088
00:52:21,791 --> 00:52:24,416
We're in Kozhikode.
Please get down everyone.

1089
00:52:26,458 --> 00:52:27,666
Get down! Get down!

1090
00:52:29,541 --> 00:52:31,291
Get down quickly.

1091
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,458
Hey, girl!

1092
00:52:35,958 --> 00:52:37,166
Don't you want the change?

1093
00:52:39,791 --> 00:52:41,958
-Where did you board the bus from?
-Poovaran Hills.

1094
00:52:44,875 --> 00:52:45,708
Okay.

1095
00:52:45,791 --> 00:52:47,875
Don't go. It's raining.
There will be a traffic block.

1096
00:52:47,958 --> 00:52:49,458
Turn it around. I'm coming.

1097
00:52:51,291 --> 00:52:54,708
Buy this book.
It's is only for 30 rupees.

1098
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:17,458
-It's raining cats and dogs in Wayanad.
-Really?

1099
00:53:17,708 --> 00:53:18,708
Yes.

1100
00:53:44,416 --> 00:53:45,916
Where do you want to go?

1101
00:53:46,583 --> 00:53:48,041
Where do you want to go?

1102
00:53:49,875 --> 00:53:52,333
-Where were you yesterday?
-I was on leave.

1103
00:53:52,416 --> 00:53:54,416
LADIES WASHROOM.

1104
00:54:14,333 --> 00:54:15,666
Pay and go, dear.

1105
00:54:16,666 --> 00:54:18,791
Once they are done, everyone
says they don't have change.

1106
00:54:40,750 --> 00:54:43,083
Everyone, get down.
We've reached the destination.

1107
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:44,416
We've reached.

1108
00:55:05,708 --> 00:55:06,833
Move aside!

1109
00:55:07,583 --> 00:55:08,750
Let me take that phone!

1110
00:55:09,666 --> 00:55:11,625
Leave me!
Let me take that phone!

1111
00:55:38,375 --> 00:55:39,375
What?

1112
00:55:41,083 --> 00:55:42,791
-My phone is switched off.
-Get going.

1113
00:55:43,166 --> 00:55:44,166
-Okay!
-Get lost.

1114
00:56:10,416 --> 00:56:12,208
VALIYERI MEDICAL SHOP.

1115
00:56:20,875 --> 00:56:22,416
Hey! Buy two!

1116
00:56:24,416 --> 00:56:25,625
Bro, two bottles of water.

1117
00:56:29,375 --> 00:56:31,000
Get me chilled bottles.

1118
00:56:35,625 --> 00:56:36,916
Make it quick.

1119
00:56:38,250 --> 00:56:39,250
Here's the water.

1120
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:41,750
Don't you have cold water?

1121
00:56:41,958 --> 00:56:43,000
Give me really chilled water.

1122
00:56:43,083 --> 00:56:44,541
You're cheating people by
naming your shop a "cool bar"?

1123
00:56:44,625 --> 00:56:45,750
That's all I have.

1124
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,375
There has been no power
since yesterday morning.

1125
00:56:47,458 --> 00:56:48,708
Why don't you close your shop?

1126
00:56:48,791 --> 00:56:50,083
I'll decide whether I should
close my shop or not.

1127
00:56:50,166 --> 00:56:51,041
Take them if you want.

1128
00:56:51,125 --> 00:56:52,791
Then, lock all this up!

1129
00:56:53,083 --> 00:56:55,041
-You're cheating people.
-Nonsense!

1130
00:56:55,125 --> 00:56:56,666
Don't create a problem here.

1131
00:56:56,750 --> 00:56:58,916
-What will you do?
-Get lost!

1132
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,041
-I won't consider that you are older.
-That's all right!

1133
00:57:01,125 --> 00:57:02,500
Shibu, get it from under the seat.

1134
00:57:03,041 --> 00:57:04,166
No, dude.

1135
00:57:04,250 --> 00:57:06,250
To hell with him and his shop!

1136
00:57:17,708 --> 00:57:19,166
You!

1137
00:57:19,708 --> 00:57:20,708
What?

1138
00:57:40,375 --> 00:57:41,583
Start the car!

1139
00:57:42,291 --> 00:57:43,666
Come out!
I'll not spare you!

1140
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:46,125
This is not our town.
Why did you have to mess up?

1141
00:57:49,625 --> 00:57:50,458
POLICE.

1142
00:57:50,541 --> 00:57:52,833
-What's the problem?
-Tell him about it.

1143
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:53,958
-Nothing sir.
-What?

1144
00:57:54,041 --> 00:57:54,875
There isn't a problem, sir.

1145
00:57:54,958 --> 00:57:56,416
-Are you sure?
-Yes, sir.

1146
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:58,500
-Okay, let's go.
-Everything is fine, sir.

1147
00:58:02,541 --> 00:58:04,208
What did you do, Roy?

1148
00:58:04,375 --> 00:58:06,541
-What?
-That guy broke three to four bottles.

1149
00:58:06,875 --> 00:58:08,833
-But, what about you?
-Hold this!

1150
00:58:12,916 --> 00:58:14,000
Hey! I'm also coming!

1151
00:58:14,583 --> 00:58:15,583
Let's go!

1152
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,500
We should have our people
on the next committee.

1153
00:58:25,041 --> 00:58:26,041
Only then it will be right.

1154
00:58:28,875 --> 00:58:30,791
-What's up?
-Nothing.

1155
00:58:34,166 --> 00:58:35,166
What's up?

1156
00:58:35,416 --> 00:58:36,708
Do you have any stuff with you?

1157
00:58:37,041 --> 00:58:38,041
No, man!

1158
00:58:38,333 --> 00:58:41,875
-I have cigarettes.
-That's fine. I have a matchbox.

1159
00:58:42,041 --> 00:58:45,750
Come on! Come and place your bets.

1160
00:58:45,916 --> 00:58:48,750
Don't think a lot.
This is the time to check your luck.

1161
00:58:48,833 --> 00:58:51,833
If you lose, I will get all the money.

1162
00:58:51,958 --> 00:58:54,333
If you're scared, then no need to play!

1163
00:58:54,416 --> 00:58:57,291
Come on. Place the bet on this one.

1164
00:58:57,833 --> 00:58:59,083
Play carefully, man!

1165
00:59:01,333 --> 00:59:03,208
-Play carefully.
-Give me 50 rupees.

1166
00:59:03,291 --> 00:59:04,958
-What?
-50 rupees!

1167
00:59:05,541 --> 00:59:06,833
I don't have money.

1168
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:17,291
-I only have 50 rupees. Play carefully.
-I'll give it when I win it!

1169
00:59:18,458 --> 00:59:20,250
Should I place it on the
club or the spade?

1170
00:59:20,583 --> 00:59:22,666
-Place it on clubs, dude.
-No. I'll place it on spade.

1171
00:59:24,250 --> 00:59:25,250
Place it on clubs!

1172
00:59:25,333 --> 00:59:26,958
I came for the festival because
you asked me to, right?

1173
00:59:27,041 --> 00:59:28,583
Why aren't you talking to me now?

1174
00:59:28,791 --> 00:59:29,791
My mother is here!

1175
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,666
Couldn't you message me that?

1176
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:33,083
People are watching!

1177
00:59:33,666 --> 00:59:36,333
Since when do you not like me?
Tell me!

1178
00:59:36,416 --> 00:59:37,666
Leave me.
That's good for you.

1179
00:59:37,833 --> 00:59:38,833
Hey!

1180
00:59:39,833 --> 00:59:42,833
Wait!
Not that way! We've to go there.

1181
00:59:44,125 --> 00:59:45,833
Santosh! Santosh!

1182
00:59:45,916 --> 00:59:49,625
Place your bets!
If it's blank, company gets the money.

1183
00:59:49,708 --> 00:59:50,833
-If it is blank--
-Yes! Double!

1184
00:59:50,916 --> 00:59:52,708
-Give it.
-I lost all my money.

1185
00:59:52,875 --> 00:59:55,833
Take it! Take it!
Come on.

1186
00:59:55,916 --> 00:59:58,000
Here you go.
Anyone can place their bets!

1187
00:59:58,083 --> 00:59:59,000
Play!

1188
00:59:59,083 --> 01:00:00,458
Stop! Stop!

1189
01:00:01,041 --> 01:00:02,458
Hey! Stop!

1190
01:00:02,666 --> 01:00:03,500
Stop right there!

1191
01:00:03,583 --> 01:00:04,958
Dude, the police are here.

1192
01:00:06,208 --> 01:00:07,416
The police is here!

1193
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:08,750
You owe me ten rupees.

1194
01:00:08,833 --> 01:00:10,375
I've already given it!

1195
01:00:10,458 --> 01:00:12,166
-Run! Run!
-Stop there!

1196
01:00:12,250 --> 01:00:13,250
Give me 500 rupees.

1197
01:00:13,416 --> 01:00:14,958
-What?
-Don't you remember? It's my money.

1198
01:00:15,833 --> 01:00:17,666
-What is this?
-These guys were gambling, sir.

1199
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:19,375
I will not spare them.
You get going!

1200
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:20,375
Go!

1201
01:00:20,791 --> 01:00:22,458
What are you looking at?
Go home!

1202
01:00:46,416 --> 01:00:47,291
Hey!

1203
01:00:47,791 --> 01:00:48,791
Hey, Roy!

1204
01:00:49,833 --> 01:00:51,125
Get up, man!

1205
01:00:52,416 --> 01:00:54,708
Seems like you got wasted yesterday.

1206
01:00:56,041 --> 01:00:57,250
Didn't you go home?

1207
01:00:58,500 --> 01:00:59,791
When did you come here?

1208
01:01:00,791 --> 01:01:01,708
Hey!

1209
01:01:01,791 --> 01:01:03,958
-Didn't you go home yesterday?
-No.

1210
01:01:04,458 --> 01:01:06,125
I didn't see you at the
festival yesterday.

1211
01:01:06,291 --> 01:01:07,708
She's alone with the kids, right?

1212
01:01:07,791 --> 01:01:08,958
I went home early.

1213
01:01:09,041 --> 01:01:11,083
Can you lend me 2,000 rupees?

1214
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:12,250
No.

1215
01:01:12,375 --> 01:01:13,375
What about 1,000?

1216
01:01:14,250 --> 01:01:16,708
I don't have anything since
I already paid the fees for the children.

1217
01:01:22,041 --> 01:01:23,041
It's okay.

1218
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Shall I leave?

1219
01:01:29,166 --> 01:01:30,625
Can you at least give me 500 rupees?

1220
01:01:31,833 --> 01:01:33,708
I'll give you if I get
something by evening.

1221
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:37,291
Shall I leave?

1222
01:01:50,666 --> 01:01:52,875
Oh, God!
Why is his face like that?

1223
01:01:56,458 --> 01:01:57,458
What's up?

1224
01:02:01,916 --> 01:02:02,916
Don't hit me!

1225
01:02:12,916 --> 01:02:13,916
You're here.

1226
01:02:14,416 --> 01:02:15,791
Where were you yesterday?

1227
01:02:16,791 --> 01:02:17,791
Roy!

1228
01:02:18,375 --> 01:02:20,916
Why don't you go home on time?

1229
01:02:21,958 --> 01:02:24,083
I know you won't like it.

1230
01:02:24,250 --> 01:02:28,125
But that girl is getting
marriage proposals now.

1231
01:02:28,458 --> 01:02:31,500
The people who are coming will
ask about the men of the house.

1232
01:02:31,833 --> 01:02:33,666
It will be good if you
don't forget that.

1233
01:02:40,041 --> 01:02:43,750
It's difficult to get jobs these
days as per your qualifications.

1234
01:02:43,958 --> 01:02:45,875
Does that mean you'll keep
wandering around?

1235
01:02:46,125 --> 01:02:48,791
You should do whatever job
you get, and do it diligently.

1236
01:02:49,208 --> 01:02:50,458
Aren't you going?

1237
01:02:50,791 --> 01:02:51,958
Why is she irritating me?

1238
01:02:52,583 --> 01:02:54,000
Where did you get her from?

1239
01:02:54,208 --> 01:02:55,041
Who? My mother?

1240
01:02:55,125 --> 01:02:57,583
Didn't you get any money
from gambling yesterday?

1241
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,375
Tell me the truth.
Didn't you get the money?

1242
01:02:59,458 --> 01:03:00,458
I got 500 rupees.

1243
01:03:00,541 --> 01:03:02,416
-And?
-I gave 300 rupees to my mother.

1244
01:03:03,416 --> 01:03:06,000
-I have 200 rupees left.
-This won't be enough for me.

1245
01:03:06,125 --> 01:03:07,125
I'll keep it.

1246
01:03:07,375 --> 01:03:08,375
I'm leaving, Mom!

1247
01:03:09,416 --> 01:03:11,166
-You're going home, right?
-What's the point of going home?

1248
01:03:11,625 --> 01:03:13,500
-Then, drop me at the market.
-Come.

1249
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,375
Roy, what are your plans?

1250
01:03:16,458 --> 01:03:17,458
There's a job.

1251
01:03:19,791 --> 01:03:22,041
I can earn around 1,50,000 rupees
in a month.

1252
01:03:22,250 --> 01:03:23,958
I just have to work for two days.

1253
01:03:24,083 --> 01:03:26,041
-1,50,000 rupees per month?
-Yes.

1254
01:03:26,708 --> 01:03:27,708
What job is this?

1255
01:03:30,750 --> 01:03:31,750
Snatching?

1256
01:03:32,291 --> 01:03:33,291
Oh, God!

1257
01:03:35,666 --> 01:03:38,250
IN REMEMBRANCE OF COMRADE,
E.K. NAYANAR.

1258
01:03:42,416 --> 01:03:43,916
Dear, the bus is here.
Come fast.

1259
01:03:52,333 --> 01:03:53,625
Get in quickly.

1260
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:55,458
Come on!

1261
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Let's go!

1262
01:04:05,125 --> 01:04:06,250
Should I take a leave?

1263
01:04:06,333 --> 01:04:07,666
Shut up and go for work!

1264
01:04:12,833 --> 01:04:14,041
Subair! Please stop.

1265
01:04:14,375 --> 01:04:15,500
Stop.

1266
01:04:15,583 --> 01:04:17,125
I'll stop.
Don't stop in front of the bus.

1267
01:04:17,416 --> 01:04:18,416
Stop, bro.

1268
01:04:18,541 --> 01:04:19,791
Please get down, sister.

1269
01:04:19,916 --> 01:04:21,250
Don't ruin our trip.

1270
01:04:23,375 --> 01:04:24,625
Come fast.

1271
01:04:28,125 --> 01:04:29,625
Stop prancing around,
and come!

1272
01:04:34,708 --> 01:04:35,916
What are you doing?

1273
01:04:36,625 --> 01:04:37,625
Come, hop on!

1274
01:04:42,833 --> 01:04:45,416
Haven't I told you not to behave
like a goon in front of people?

1275
01:04:45,583 --> 01:04:46,833
-Did they get you married?
-It's quite embarrassing.

1276
01:04:46,916 --> 01:04:48,083
Did they?

1277
01:04:48,416 --> 01:04:50,625
I didn't see you at the bus stop.
Were you trying to escape?

1278
01:04:51,458 --> 01:04:53,125
I called you so many
times in the morning.

1279
01:04:53,916 --> 01:04:56,125
I called you back.
Why didn't you pick up?

1280
01:04:57,500 --> 01:04:59,708
Leave that.
What about that thing I said?

1281
01:05:00,541 --> 01:05:02,791
Where will I get money from,
in the middle of training?

1282
01:05:03,625 --> 01:05:05,541
If I ask my dad, it
will take two days.

1283
01:05:06,041 --> 01:05:08,208
If I tell him it's for you,
then I won't get it at all.

1284
01:05:10,375 --> 01:05:11,833
To hell with you and your dad!

1285
01:05:13,958 --> 01:05:15,708
Give me 100 rupees for petrol.

1286
01:05:16,041 --> 01:05:17,541
I would have taken the bus, right?

1287
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,833
-You're such a pain!
-Yes, too much!

1288
01:05:22,625 --> 01:05:24,166
I don't think this will work out, Roy.

1289
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,416
Find someone who has a job.
That would be better.

1290
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,708
There's no point talking to you.
I'm going.

1291
01:05:30,791 --> 01:05:31,791
Don't go!

1292
01:05:31,916 --> 01:05:32,916
People are watching!

1293
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,333
What are you doing, Roy?

1294
01:05:34,916 --> 01:05:36,875
-What?
-What?

1295
01:05:37,666 --> 01:05:40,375
-Leave my hand.
-Your fingers have become fat.

1296
01:05:42,041 --> 01:05:44,500
I have an interview at Kozhikode.

1297
01:05:45,041 --> 01:05:46,250
You can forget about this.

1298
01:05:46,333 --> 01:05:48,166
You can mortgage it but
don't sell it.

1299
01:05:49,083 --> 01:05:50,375
I'll think about it.

1300
01:05:53,125 --> 01:05:55,041
-Let's go?
-I am short of 200 rupees.

1301
01:05:55,708 --> 01:05:58,500
200 rupees?
That's all right.

1302
01:05:58,666 --> 01:06:00,333
When people buy something,
the amount increases.

1303
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:01,791
And when they sell it,
the amount decreases.

1304
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:04,250
Especially for gold.
Hold this.

1305
01:06:05,125 --> 01:06:06,125
Give it to me.

1306
01:06:07,916 --> 01:06:09,333
Wait.
Let me finish this.

1307
01:06:09,458 --> 01:06:10,416
Can't you see?

1308
01:06:11,750 --> 01:06:12,833
Get down, man.

1309
01:06:14,083 --> 01:06:15,833
-You get down.
-Is it okay?

1310
01:06:20,208 --> 01:06:21,041
Make me a drink.

1311
01:06:22,583 --> 01:06:23,416
There's no water.

1312
01:06:24,833 --> 01:06:26,916
So, I've to take care of the
electricity and water.

1313
01:06:27,250 --> 01:06:29,125
And you'll take care
of the beverages.

1314
01:06:29,916 --> 01:06:31,041
Understood, right?

1315
01:06:31,125 --> 01:06:33,333
After two drinks, you
become a different person.

1316
01:06:37,625 --> 01:06:40,041
-Would he be here?
-He should be here.

1317
01:06:40,125 --> 01:06:41,125
He'll be here.

1318
01:06:42,375 --> 01:06:43,833
Riyaz!
Is Roy inside?

1319
01:06:43,916 --> 01:06:46,083
-He's there.
-Why don't you come for the meetings?

1320
01:06:46,166 --> 01:06:47,458
When are you going?

1321
01:06:47,750 --> 01:06:50,000
I have to go in the morning.
I forgot.

1322
01:06:50,875 --> 01:06:51,875
Hey, Krishna!

1323
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,208
-Krishna, do you want one?
-No.

1324
01:06:54,458 --> 01:06:55,458
I don't booze.

1325
01:06:56,458 --> 01:06:57,583
When did you stop?

1326
01:06:57,958 --> 01:06:59,166
How does it matter to him?

1327
01:07:01,625 --> 01:07:02,500
Yes.

1328
01:07:02,875 --> 01:07:04,666
-Come here.
-Tell me.

1329
01:07:05,083 --> 01:07:06,666
I need to tell you something. Come.

1330
01:07:07,625 --> 01:07:09,416
Go.
Don't upset the party members.

1331
01:07:12,541 --> 01:07:13,541
What is it, bro?

1332
01:07:14,041 --> 01:07:15,833
This is Pradeepan.
You know, right?

1333
01:07:15,916 --> 01:07:17,416
There's a small problem.

1334
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:19,250
It's something we can't avoid.

1335
01:07:19,541 --> 01:07:20,791
You need to help me.

1336
01:07:23,375 --> 01:07:25,000
He will get involved in all this.

1337
01:07:25,083 --> 01:07:26,875
If we take too long, we'll
get calls from everywhere

1338
01:07:26,958 --> 01:07:29,166
and things will go out of control.

1339
01:07:29,375 --> 01:07:30,375
I'll think about it.

1340
01:07:30,916 --> 01:07:32,125
It's not a big deal.

1341
01:07:32,750 --> 01:07:34,583
It's okay. You can do it
after you come back.

1342
01:07:36,375 --> 01:07:38,791
Krishna, after this is over...

1343
01:07:39,916 --> 01:07:42,166
if you say that it's for the
party and the movement...

1344
01:07:43,625 --> 01:07:45,000
you'll see my true colors.

1345
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:47,833
This is our personal problem.

1346
01:07:47,916 --> 01:07:49,208
Don't be afraid.

1347
01:07:50,625 --> 01:07:52,500
They came to me because
they are scared, right?

1348
01:07:52,750 --> 01:07:54,416
And then they tell me
to not be afraid.

1349
01:07:54,583 --> 01:07:56,500
Don't worry about anything.

1350
01:07:56,833 --> 01:07:58,333
We'll fix everything.

1351
01:07:58,875 --> 01:07:59,875
Come.

1352
01:08:00,375 --> 01:08:02,291
-Will it happen?
-He has promised us. He will do it.

1353
01:08:02,750 --> 01:08:03,791
You know him, right?

1354
01:08:09,125 --> 01:08:10,500
Aren't you going for the
interview tomorrow?

1355
01:08:10,666 --> 01:08:11,666
Of course.

1356
01:08:12,833 --> 01:08:13,791
Where are you now?

1357
01:08:13,875 --> 01:08:15,125
I'm preparing for it.

1358
01:08:15,208 --> 01:08:17,041
Wow! So, have you decided to reform?

1359
01:08:20,583 --> 01:08:22,791
Got it.
You're at the workshop, right?

1360
01:08:23,208 --> 01:08:24,375
How many drinks did you have?

1361
01:08:24,458 --> 01:08:25,541
You found out, right?

1362
01:08:25,916 --> 01:08:26,791
Tell me.

1363
01:08:26,875 --> 01:08:29,041
Did you tell your parents about
your interview?

1364
01:08:29,333 --> 01:08:30,791
Why did you call me now?

1365
01:08:30,916 --> 01:08:32,208
I called to wish you.

1366
01:08:33,750 --> 01:08:34,750
Good night!

1367
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:39,541
She called to wish me.

1368
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:50,125
You can go now.

1369
01:08:58,166 --> 01:08:59,208
<span style="style.center_1">How's it going?</span>

1370
01:08:59,458 --> 01:09:00,958
-What happened?
-Is it over?

1371
01:09:01,041 --> 01:09:03,166
Yeah, I got the job!

1372
01:09:03,791 --> 01:09:05,583
They told me to come collect
my salary tomorrow.

1373
01:09:05,666 --> 01:09:07,833
-Why are you talking like this, Roy?
-Just hang up now!

1374
01:09:17,041 --> 01:09:18,041
Is it your wife?

1375
01:09:18,583 --> 01:09:19,583
No! It was my aunt!

1376
01:09:25,416 --> 01:09:26,750
You can go in.

1377
01:09:28,583 --> 01:09:29,916
How was it?
Okay, right?

1378
01:09:31,791 --> 01:09:32,916
WELCOME.

1379
01:09:33,375 --> 01:09:35,250
You can wish me while entering.

1380
01:09:46,958 --> 01:09:48,833
Nothing like that.

1381
01:09:48,958 --> 01:09:50,458
I've done my best.

1382
01:09:50,666 --> 01:09:53,375
The issue was with the year
of course completion.

1383
01:09:53,958 --> 01:09:56,000
I've talked and sorted it all out.

1384
01:09:56,291 --> 01:09:58,833
You can message me in the evening.
I'll tell you in detail.

1385
01:09:59,416 --> 01:10:01,125
So, call me after joining.

1386
01:10:02,083 --> 01:10:03,083
Okay.

1387
01:10:08,750 --> 01:10:09,750
So, Roy...

1388
01:10:09,916 --> 01:10:12,583
BBA graduates have nine job offers.

1389
01:10:13,125 --> 01:10:15,166
Five of them are already finalized.

1390
01:10:15,458 --> 01:10:18,541
The rest of them will be appointed
at Chennai or Bangalore.

1391
01:10:19,416 --> 01:10:20,291
You know, right?

1392
01:10:20,625 --> 01:10:22,916
Everyone wants
experienced candidates.

1393
01:10:24,166 --> 01:10:27,083
The only problem is
that you're a fresher.

1394
01:10:27,166 --> 01:10:30,125
Sir, once I get the job, there will be
no problem with the experience.

1395
01:10:30,791 --> 01:10:32,208
That's true but...

1396
01:10:32,333 --> 01:10:34,500
Places like these are meant
for the freshers, right?

1397
01:10:34,583 --> 01:10:36,833
Many people are waiting
for this job itself.

1398
01:10:36,916 --> 01:10:40,333
So, we need to compromise a little.
If you can do that...

1399
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:42,916
If you want a job, you need to do
some adjustments.

1400
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,083
Adjustments, right?

1401
01:10:44,208 --> 01:10:46,125
Can you arrange 2,00,000 rupees?

1402
01:10:46,208 --> 01:10:47,166
I'll get you the job.

1403
01:10:47,250 --> 01:10:49,875
You give me 2,00,000 rupees.
I'll give you something!

1404
01:10:54,625 --> 01:10:56,625
DO YOU WANT TO WORK ABROAD?
BRITE'S INDIA.

1405
01:10:57,500 --> 01:10:58,750
Do you have a cigarette?

1406
01:10:59,083 --> 01:11:01,000
I just have one. Want to share?

1407
01:11:01,083 --> 01:11:02,083
Okay.

1408
01:11:04,416 --> 01:11:07,833
-How was your interview?
-These guys are fake.

1409
01:11:09,583 --> 01:11:11,625
-Interview, it seems.
-Did they ask you for money?

1410
01:11:11,916 --> 01:11:13,333
If it was money, it was okay.

1411
01:11:14,208 --> 01:11:17,625
Are we so desperate that we have to act as
a pimp to get a job in our Kerala?

1412
01:11:18,541 --> 01:11:20,041
No point talking about it.

1413
01:11:20,333 --> 01:11:23,125
I wanted to slap that
guy sitting inside.

1414
01:11:23,708 --> 01:11:24,708
Did you?

1415
01:11:25,541 --> 01:11:27,291
-Did you slap him?
-No.

1416
01:11:27,375 --> 01:11:29,041
-I didn't slap him.
-You didn't?

1417
01:11:29,125 --> 01:11:30,375
I don't have that habit.

1418
01:11:31,208 --> 01:11:33,125
Shall I leave?
Okay?

1419
01:11:36,083 --> 01:11:37,083
15 rupees!

1420
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:54,083
-Roy!
-Riyaz, where are you?

1421
01:11:54,416 --> 01:11:55,416
I'm working.

1422
01:11:56,083 --> 01:11:58,041
-How was it?
-Don't even ask!

1423
01:11:58,166 --> 01:12:00,666
-Why?
-<span style="style.center_1">They want girls apparently!</span>

1424
01:12:00,750 --> 01:12:04,291
I don't know what to say.
It's a task to get a job.

1425
01:12:04,708 --> 01:12:05,916
That's great!

1426
01:12:06,458 --> 01:12:08,250
Since you don't have money, do one thing.

1427
01:12:08,333 --> 01:12:09,791
Arrange a girl from somewhere.

1428
01:12:09,875 --> 01:12:11,125
Get lost!

1429
01:12:11,541 --> 01:12:14,000
These people just take advantage
of people who work hard.

1430
01:12:14,083 --> 01:12:18,916
Dude, people do much bigger frauds
to get a job in today's times.

1431
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,333
Think about it and do something.

1432
01:12:21,958 --> 01:12:23,208
Or wait.

1433
01:12:23,875 --> 01:12:25,875
You know Abu, right?
Call him.

1434
01:12:25,958 --> 01:12:28,833
He does all sorts of things.
Do you have his number?

1435
01:12:28,916 --> 01:12:31,125
Yes, I have it.

1436
01:12:31,708 --> 01:12:32,625
I'll call him.

1437
01:12:32,708 --> 01:12:34,333
Or you come here.

1438
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:36,333
-I'll talk to the supervisor.
-Riyaz!

1439
01:12:36,416 --> 01:12:37,833
I think you are here to work!

1440
01:12:37,916 --> 01:12:39,583
I don't pay you to be on your phone.

1441
01:12:40,208 --> 01:12:41,208
Do your work!

1442
01:12:41,333 --> 01:12:43,666
He keeps complaining all the time!

1443
01:12:52,291 --> 01:12:54,666
-Catch him!
-Catch him!

1444
01:12:56,166 --> 01:12:57,625
Picking pockets, you rascal?

1445
01:12:57,750 --> 01:12:59,291
Move! Let me take my phone!

1446
01:13:02,708 --> 01:13:04,833
-Beat him!
-Not that! My phone!

1447
01:13:04,916 --> 01:13:06,625
Let me take that phone.
Leave me!

1448
01:13:45,916 --> 01:13:47,875
Bro, can you give me
your phone to make a call?

1449
01:13:48,208 --> 01:13:49,666
My phone fell here.
I can't find it.

1450
01:13:49,791 --> 01:13:50,791
Here?

1451
01:13:51,041 --> 01:13:52,458
Just let it ring.

1452
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,416
It's switched off.

1453
01:14:31,083 --> 01:14:33,291
Hello, Vishnu, it's me, Jessy.
Where are you?

1454
01:14:33,375 --> 01:14:34,791
<span style="style.center_1">I've been calling since so long.</span>

1455
01:14:35,250 --> 01:14:36,250
<span style="style.center_1">Hello?</span>

1456
01:14:38,083 --> 01:14:39,458
<span style="style.center_1">Haven't you reached yet?</span>

1457
01:14:40,916 --> 01:14:43,666
<span style="style.center_1">I'm in the toilet.</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Can you come here?</span>

1458
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:47,333
What are you doing inside? Come out!

1459
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:13,166
<span style="style.center_1">Vishnu, can't you hear anything?</span>

1460
01:15:24,083 --> 01:15:24,958
Are you outside?

1461
01:15:25,125 --> 01:15:26,458
Will you be able to identify me?

1462
01:15:26,541 --> 01:15:29,500
I'm wearing a cream <span style="style.center_1">churidar</span>
and a red shawl.

1463
01:15:31,125 --> 01:15:32,458
Say something, man.

1464
01:15:34,250 --> 01:15:35,541
Shall I come out?

1465
01:15:37,833 --> 01:15:39,708
Be on the phone.
Don't hang up.

1466
01:15:39,875 --> 01:15:40,750
Yes.

1467
01:15:40,833 --> 01:15:42,208
Okay, fine.

1468
01:15:42,291 --> 01:15:43,291
The bus that came from Wayanad in
the morning--

1469
01:15:43,375 --> 01:15:44,250
It's at the end.

1470
01:15:44,333 --> 01:15:46,250
I don't want to go.
Is there someone who came on it?

1471
01:15:46,333 --> 01:15:47,833
I work on that bus.
What's the matter?

1472
01:15:48,208 --> 01:15:51,583
Did a girl get on at Poovaran Hills?
Must be around 18 to 20 years old.

1473
01:15:51,750 --> 01:15:54,375
Is it the fair girl with curly hair?

1474
01:15:54,875 --> 01:15:56,750
Yes. She got off here at Kozhikode.

1475
01:15:56,916 --> 01:15:58,083
She got off here.

1476
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:00,041
She was standing next to me
when I was having tea.

1477
01:16:00,125 --> 01:16:00,958
Where?

1478
01:16:01,041 --> 01:16:01,875
I saw her standing there.

1479
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,333
Did you check there?

1480
01:16:03,958 --> 01:16:04,958
I did.

1481
01:16:06,708 --> 01:16:07,791
Try calling her.

1482
01:16:08,125 --> 01:16:10,291
I lost my phone when I got here.

1483
01:16:10,458 --> 01:16:11,333
Here.

1484
01:16:11,541 --> 01:16:13,958
-You can use my phone.
-I don't have her number.

1485
01:16:15,791 --> 01:16:18,125
You should at least remember
the important numbers, right?

1486
01:16:18,208 --> 01:16:21,125
-I'll try calling my phone.
-Let's check there.

1487
01:16:22,708 --> 01:16:23,708
Where are you?

1488
01:16:24,083 --> 01:16:26,041
-I'm outside.
-Are you wearing a pink shirt?

1489
01:16:26,291 --> 01:16:28,125
Turn around!
This side!

1490
01:16:29,041 --> 01:16:30,041
Here!

1491
01:16:35,416 --> 01:16:37,250
I got worried when
you didn't pick up.

1492
01:16:38,750 --> 01:16:40,833
-Can you buy me some water?
-Do you want water?

1493
01:16:40,916 --> 01:16:41,916
Come.

1494
01:17:00,583 --> 01:17:02,958
It was engaged till sometime back.
Now it's switched off.

1495
01:17:03,083 --> 01:17:04,958
Someone else must have taken it.

1496
01:17:05,833 --> 01:17:07,166
She was standing there a while ago.

1497
01:17:08,041 --> 01:17:09,458
Come, let's check there.

1498
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:13,083
Once someone gets lost in the crowd,
then you can never find them.

1499
01:17:13,333 --> 01:17:14,958
-That's the problem.
-Here's your phone.

1500
01:17:18,208 --> 01:17:19,750
Was it here or there?

1501
01:17:20,166 --> 01:17:21,500
What, bro?

1502
01:17:21,625 --> 01:17:23,583
I think I was standing there.

1503
01:17:25,333 --> 01:17:27,250
Do you remember what
she was wearing?

1504
01:17:27,708 --> 01:17:28,750
Not really.

1505
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:35,833
There she is!

1506
01:17:36,041 --> 01:17:37,041
That one?

1507
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,291
-Shall I leave?
-Thank you, bro.

1508
01:17:51,958 --> 01:17:52,958
Here.

1509
01:17:55,625 --> 01:17:59,166
I was going to tell you.
You have mistaken me.

1510
01:17:59,458 --> 01:18:01,041
I came to give you the phone.

1511
01:18:03,208 --> 01:18:04,291
You're Vishnu, right?

1512
01:18:05,166 --> 01:18:07,750
-Yes. You?
-I found your phone.

1513
01:18:09,375 --> 01:18:10,375
Make way!

1514
01:18:24,625 --> 01:18:27,208
-When he picked up the phone, I thought...
-That's okay.

1515
01:18:38,375 --> 01:18:39,375
What happened?

1516
01:18:40,666 --> 01:18:42,833
I got very scared when
I couldn't get through.

1517
01:18:42,916 --> 01:18:44,666
I was also really worried.

1518
01:18:46,333 --> 01:18:48,916
-Shall we go somewhere else?
-Let's go.

1519
01:18:51,750 --> 01:18:55,083
<span style="style.center_1">The moment when the distance is over</span>

1520
01:18:55,166 --> 01:18:59,416
<span style="style.center_1">The blue sky is up there, far away</span>

1521
01:18:59,916 --> 01:19:03,166
<span style="style.center_1">An unseen seashore</span>

1522
01:19:03,250 --> 01:19:07,083
<span style="style.center_1">The mind is as deep as the sea</span>

1523
01:19:07,166 --> 01:19:11,208
<span style="style.center_1">Many days have gone by</span>

1524
01:19:11,291 --> 01:19:16,833
<span style="style.center_1">Many a tears have been shed</span>

1525
01:19:16,916 --> 01:19:18,833
<span style="style.center_1">Didn't it shower like waves?</span>

1526
01:19:19,291 --> 01:19:23,000
<span style="style.center_1">Waiting for the arrival of this day</span>

1527
01:19:23,291 --> 01:19:26,791
<span style="style.center_1">Adorned with the song</span>

1528
01:19:26,875 --> 01:19:29,458
<span style="style.center_1">That the waves sang, until now</span>

1529
01:19:43,916 --> 01:19:47,125
<span style="style.center_1">For this moment</span>

1530
01:19:47,208 --> 01:19:51,166
<span style="style.center_1">To continue just like this</span>

1531
01:19:51,250 --> 01:19:55,041
<span style="style.center_1">You just have to be</span>

1532
01:19:55,125 --> 01:19:58,708
<span style="style.center_1">By my side, hereafter</span>

1533
01:20:07,791 --> 01:20:11,041
<span style="style.center_1">The moment when the distance is over</span>

1534
01:20:11,208 --> 01:20:15,583
<span style="style.center_1">The blue sky is up there, far away</span>

1535
01:20:15,916 --> 01:20:19,166
<span style="style.center_1">An unseen seashore</span>

1536
01:20:19,250 --> 01:20:23,125
<span style="style.center_1">The mind is as deep as the sea</span>

1537
01:20:23,291 --> 01:20:27,166
<span style="style.center_1">Both fingers are like the flames</span>

1538
01:20:27,250 --> 01:20:33,083
<span style="style.center_1">As we walk through the streets,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Lost in ourselves</span>

1539
01:20:33,958 --> 01:20:35,166
I like this place.

1540
01:20:35,791 --> 01:20:36,916
This is a nice place.

1541
01:20:37,250 --> 01:20:40,583
I'm coming inside for the first time.
I've just dropped people here.

1542
01:20:41,916 --> 01:20:43,125
It's quiet and peaceful here.

1543
01:20:44,416 --> 01:20:47,166
It's like the place
where you live, right?

1544
01:20:47,625 --> 01:20:49,083
Maybe that's why I liked it.

1545
01:20:51,041 --> 01:20:52,375
You said you'll show me the sea!

1546
01:20:52,458 --> 01:20:56,000
Of course! The sea should be seen in the
evening. That's when it looks great.

1547
01:20:56,791 --> 01:20:58,125
You have to take me, okay?

1548
01:20:58,666 --> 01:20:59,666
Sit closer.

1549
01:20:59,916 --> 01:21:02,083
<span style="style.center_1">For this moment</span>

1550
01:21:02,166 --> 01:21:04,166
I just want to take a selfie.
Come on!

1551
01:21:04,250 --> 01:21:05,208
Okay.

1552
01:21:05,291 --> 01:21:07,041
<span style="style.center_1">To continue just like this</span>

1553
01:21:07,208 --> 01:21:09,500
<span style="style.center_1">You just have to be</span>

1554
01:21:09,583 --> 01:21:10,583
Come.

1555
01:21:11,291 --> 01:21:16,000
<span style="style.center_1">By my side, hereafter</span>

1556
01:21:21,833 --> 01:21:24,125
Isn't that the guy who
gave us the phone?

1557
01:21:24,375 --> 01:21:25,375
-Where?
-Over there.

1558
01:21:36,750 --> 01:21:39,250
-He has been following us for a while.
-Really?

1559
01:21:39,750 --> 01:21:41,875
I saw him earlier, but I
didn't want to tell you.

1560
01:21:47,333 --> 01:21:48,583
Why is he following us?

1561
01:21:49,333 --> 01:21:50,625
-You wait here.
-No! Don't go.

1562
01:21:50,708 --> 01:21:52,791
-Let's go somewhere else.
-Wherever we go, he follows us.

1563
01:21:53,125 --> 01:21:54,000
Wait here.

1564
01:21:59,791 --> 01:22:01,666
He's coming.
You hang up.

1565
01:22:04,166 --> 01:22:05,166
What's going on, dude?

1566
01:22:06,041 --> 01:22:07,791
That's what I'm asking you.

1567
01:22:07,916 --> 01:22:09,375
Why are you following us?

1568
01:22:09,458 --> 01:22:11,958
-Is this the first time you're seeing her?
-Why do you care?

1569
01:22:12,041 --> 01:22:13,458
Why are you pushing me?

1570
01:22:13,666 --> 01:22:14,625
Don't touch me.

1571
01:22:14,708 --> 01:22:16,541
Don't think that you can bother us
because you returned the phone.

1572
01:22:16,666 --> 01:22:17,500
Really?

1573
01:22:17,583 --> 01:22:19,750
-I told you not to push me!
-Stop holding my hand!

1574
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:24,541
-Come to my town, you're...
-This is everyone's town!

1575
01:22:28,208 --> 01:22:29,541
How dare you touch me!

1576
01:22:30,083 --> 01:22:31,041
Hey!

1577
01:22:31,166 --> 01:22:33,791
Vishnu, stop!
Listen to me! Stop it!

1578
01:22:34,083 --> 01:22:36,750
-He started it!
-Let's not get into this.

1579
01:22:36,875 --> 01:22:40,000
I didn't do anything.
Why is he following us?

1580
01:22:40,833 --> 01:22:41,833
Hey!

1581
01:22:41,958 --> 01:22:43,208
Come here, you asshole!

1582
01:23:00,375 --> 01:23:01,500
Oh, God!

1583
01:23:16,416 --> 01:23:17,416
Come on.

1584
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:19,333
-That guy hurt his head.
-Get up.

1585
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:22,416
What's the problem?

1586
01:23:26,750 --> 01:23:28,041
Hey! What's going on here?

1587
01:23:28,750 --> 01:23:29,916
What's the problem?

1588
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,291
-They were fighting here.
-He started it, sir.

1589
01:23:32,375 --> 01:23:33,250
The other guy left.

1590
01:23:33,333 --> 01:23:35,541
He pushed that girl into the water.

1591
01:23:35,708 --> 01:23:37,458
He was trying to do
moral policing, sir.

1592
01:23:37,625 --> 01:23:39,125
We know how to handle things here.

1593
01:23:39,375 --> 01:23:40,708
Where's your house?

1594
01:23:40,791 --> 01:23:41,791
It's in Kannur, sir.

1595
01:23:41,916 --> 01:23:43,833
-What are you doing here?
-I had an interview.

1596
01:23:43,916 --> 01:23:45,500
You should go home when
your interview is over.

1597
01:23:45,583 --> 01:23:47,583
Go! Go!
Everyone can leave now!

1598
01:23:47,791 --> 01:23:49,583
All of you, leave!

1599
01:23:49,791 --> 01:23:52,041
Disperse!
What are you waiting here for? Go!

1600
01:23:52,125 --> 01:23:54,250
Why are you standing here? Leave, leave!

1601
01:23:54,375 --> 01:23:55,375
Go! Go!

1602
01:24:08,375 --> 01:24:09,541
Hello!
Who's this? Tell me.

1603
01:24:12,541 --> 01:24:14,541
Oh! How are you doing?

1604
01:24:17,541 --> 01:24:18,666
When did you reach?

1605
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:25,500
When?

1606
01:24:27,958 --> 01:24:28,958
And then?

1607
01:24:33,166 --> 01:24:34,166
Where?

1608
01:24:34,916 --> 01:24:36,208
Just wait there.
I'll come in ten minutes.

1609
01:24:41,750 --> 01:24:43,708
Why don't you take one of these?

1610
01:24:44,291 --> 01:24:45,291
Is your hand wounded?

1611
01:24:46,291 --> 01:24:47,291
-Show me.
-It's okay.

1612
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:52,625
Show me this one.

1613
01:24:54,750 --> 01:24:56,083
Is this okay?

1614
01:24:56,375 --> 01:24:57,375
Okay?

1615
01:24:58,666 --> 01:24:59,666
Give me this one.

1616
01:25:01,375 --> 01:25:03,041
Give me a T-shirt in my size.

1617
01:25:04,958 --> 01:25:05,791
Is this okay?

1618
01:25:05,916 --> 01:25:07,041
Yeah, that's fine.

1619
01:25:07,125 --> 01:25:08,958
-How much?
-340 rupees.

1620
01:25:14,916 --> 01:25:16,000
What happened?

1621
01:25:16,958 --> 01:25:19,083
-Is that blood?
-That's okay.

1622
01:25:19,250 --> 01:25:20,500
-Start the bike.
-Hop on!

1623
01:25:20,583 --> 01:25:21,875
-They left.
-Where did they go?

1624
01:25:22,125 --> 01:25:23,166
I don't know where they went.

1625
01:25:23,250 --> 01:25:25,166
-Can you recognize them?
-Then hop on quickly.

1626
01:25:26,708 --> 01:25:28,125
-Did they go this way?
-That way.

1627
01:25:34,958 --> 01:25:35,958
Are you hungry?

1628
01:25:37,083 --> 01:25:38,166
Are you hungry?

1629
01:25:38,750 --> 01:25:39,916
I was hungry but not anymore.

1630
01:25:46,875 --> 01:25:47,833
I'll call you.

1631
01:25:47,916 --> 01:25:49,250
<span style="style.center_1">What are you going to do, Roy?</span>

1632
01:25:49,500 --> 01:25:52,125
-Can you please hang up, Annie?
-<span style="style.center_1">Roy, listen to me!</span>

1633
01:25:56,125 --> 01:25:57,416
Shall we have a couple of drinks?

1634
01:25:57,958 --> 01:26:00,250
I won't leave without beating him up.

1635
01:26:00,375 --> 01:26:02,333
Not that.
Shall we have a couple of drinks?

1636
01:26:05,416 --> 01:26:07,166
I can't let it go like that, Abu.

1637
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:10,666
They won't leave that soon, anyway.

1638
01:26:11,125 --> 01:26:12,541
Move.
We'll fix everything.

1639
01:26:17,375 --> 01:26:18,208
Come.

1640
01:26:34,541 --> 01:26:36,333
I'll go and wash my face.

1641
01:27:32,583 --> 01:27:33,583
What?

1642
01:27:34,166 --> 01:27:35,166
What?

1643
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,000
What happened?

1644
01:27:49,916 --> 01:27:51,166
We came to freshen up, right?

1645
01:27:52,291 --> 01:27:53,208
Yes.

1646
01:27:54,750 --> 01:27:56,916
If you give me your shirt,
I'll wash it.

1647
01:28:02,875 --> 01:28:03,875
Okay.

1648
01:28:36,166 --> 01:28:37,458
Bro, here's the water.

1649
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,083
-How are you?
-I'm okay.

1650
01:28:43,166 --> 01:28:44,750
Let me know if you need anything.

1651
01:28:52,250 --> 01:28:53,750
I can't believe they got away.

1652
01:28:53,833 --> 01:28:55,250
You should've given him a tight slap.

1653
01:28:55,333 --> 01:28:56,791
People gathered by then.

1654
01:28:56,875 --> 01:28:58,208
And the police turned up.

1655
01:28:58,458 --> 01:28:59,458
Drink!

1656
01:29:06,916 --> 01:29:08,000
Go and freshen up.

1657
01:29:09,041 --> 01:29:10,833
I'll get some food for us.

1658
01:29:11,375 --> 01:29:13,083
-Come back soon.
-Yeah, I will.

1659
01:29:15,041 --> 01:29:16,416
Lock the door!

1660
01:29:27,416 --> 01:29:29,125
-Do you have cigarettes?
-No, sir.

1661
01:29:29,208 --> 01:29:31,125
There's a shop nearby.
You'll get it there.

1662
01:29:31,583 --> 01:29:32,708
I'll go buy some.

1663
01:29:33,708 --> 01:29:35,083
-Come soon.
-Let this be here.

1664
01:29:43,791 --> 01:29:44,708
Lakshmi, tell me.

1665
01:29:45,458 --> 01:29:46,541
<span style="style.center_1">Did you reach?</span>

1666
01:29:46,625 --> 01:29:47,666
<span style="style.center_1">I reached a while back.</span>

1667
01:29:48,291 --> 01:29:49,875
I called you so many times, Jessy!

1668
01:29:49,958 --> 01:29:51,250
Why didn't you call me back?

1669
01:29:52,541 --> 01:29:54,208
-Did you see him?
-Yes, I did.

1670
01:29:54,333 --> 01:29:56,291
-He's awesome.
-Really?

1671
01:29:56,458 --> 01:29:59,166
-Where is he?
-He's just gone out.

1672
01:30:00,125 --> 01:30:01,583
Why? Where are you?

1673
01:30:01,666 --> 01:30:03,625
Me? I am...

1674
01:30:04,041 --> 01:30:05,500
I'm at a lodge now.

1675
01:30:05,625 --> 01:30:07,583
What? A lodge?

1676
01:30:08,500 --> 01:30:10,958
What are you doing, Jessy?
Have you gone crazy?

1677
01:30:11,166 --> 01:30:13,000
You're getting me wrong.

1678
01:30:13,166 --> 01:30:16,166
When we went to the park,
my clothes got soiled.

1679
01:30:16,333 --> 01:30:18,666
So, we came here so
that I can change.

1680
01:30:19,666 --> 01:30:21,000
-And then?
-Okay.

1681
01:30:21,333 --> 01:30:22,833
You'll reach by evening, right?

1682
01:30:22,916 --> 01:30:25,458
-My mother is asking me about you.
-I'll be there.

1683
01:30:26,166 --> 01:30:28,541
-What did you tell her?
-<span style="style.center_1">I told her you went to buy something.</span>

1684
01:30:28,625 --> 01:30:30,500
Hey! I'll call you later.

1685
01:30:31,875 --> 01:30:34,041
Lakshmi, did you take my phone?

1686
01:30:36,916 --> 01:30:39,166
-Are you Jessy?
-Yes. Who are you?

1687
01:30:40,125 --> 01:30:41,166
Where is he?

1688
01:30:41,875 --> 01:30:43,875
Vishnu has gone out.

1689
01:30:53,875 --> 01:30:54,958
I'll call him.

1690
01:31:06,583 --> 01:31:07,583
What happened?

1691
01:31:11,833 --> 01:31:12,916
I'll be there soon.

1692
01:31:14,916 --> 01:31:16,083
Give me a minute.

1693
01:31:28,541 --> 01:31:29,833
Bro, take me to Lissy Lodge.

1694
01:31:31,958 --> 01:31:32,958
This way.

1695
01:31:42,541 --> 01:31:45,166
Abu, come!
Got him. Come on!

1696
01:31:45,916 --> 01:31:48,166
-Get the phone and keys.
-Here, take it.

1697
01:31:48,625 --> 01:31:50,833
-Keep this.
-I'll clear the bill later.

1698
01:31:51,791 --> 01:31:54,666
-Go. Which way did he go?
-This way.

1699
01:31:57,458 --> 01:31:58,875
The name is Chinchu.

1700
01:31:59,291 --> 01:32:01,250
The auto rickshaw's name is Chinchu.

1701
01:32:12,625 --> 01:32:15,041
-When did you come?
-It's been a while.

1702
01:32:15,875 --> 01:32:18,000
-Really?
-What did you do, Vishnu?

1703
01:32:18,083 --> 01:32:20,208
-What happened?
-What happened to your phone?

1704
01:32:20,333 --> 01:32:22,291
What do I say?

1705
01:32:24,333 --> 01:32:25,583
Didn't you guys talk?

1706
01:32:25,666 --> 01:32:26,833
No. She didn't say anything.

1707
01:32:27,166 --> 01:32:28,166
She is Saleena.

1708
01:32:28,250 --> 01:32:29,958
She is really dear to me.

1709
01:32:30,791 --> 01:32:32,583
She runs this lodge.

1710
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:41,333
She is smart!

1711
01:32:42,125 --> 01:32:44,500
I know that your
selection won't be bad.

1712
01:32:46,708 --> 01:32:47,666
Well...

1713
01:32:48,458 --> 01:32:50,916
aren't you both going
to Mangalapuram today?

1714
01:32:52,791 --> 01:32:53,666
Where?

1715
01:32:54,708 --> 01:32:55,750
Please come with me.

1716
01:32:55,833 --> 01:32:56,791
Just a second.

1717
01:32:56,875 --> 01:32:58,458
-Come!
-What is it?

1718
01:33:01,833 --> 01:33:03,083
What is it?

1719
01:33:04,125 --> 01:33:06,083
-Why did you come here?
-Leave my hand!

1720
01:33:06,250 --> 01:33:07,500
To meet you!

1721
01:33:08,250 --> 01:33:09,791
-He had called me.
-Lower your voice.

1722
01:33:09,916 --> 01:33:11,333
He said that he couldn't get through.

1723
01:33:11,458 --> 01:33:12,583
I tried calling you so many times.

1724
01:33:12,666 --> 01:33:14,666
It was either switched off or
out of coverage.

1725
01:33:15,458 --> 01:33:18,625
Why didn't you talk anything after
picking up the phone?

1726
01:33:20,333 --> 01:33:23,125
And it's impossible that you won't
visit this place.

1727
01:33:24,083 --> 01:33:27,291
Ma'am, I can't take her
to Mangalapuram now.

1728
01:33:27,583 --> 01:33:29,833
I will do it later,
in due course.

1729
01:33:31,958 --> 01:33:34,333
Don't forget that
you've borrowed money, Vishnu.

1730
01:33:34,458 --> 01:33:36,625
I am good at my work.

1731
01:33:36,708 --> 01:33:37,958
I will bring her.

1732
01:33:38,416 --> 01:33:40,916
Call him and tell.
Don't get me tensed.

1733
01:33:43,125 --> 01:33:44,541
Call him quickly!

1734
01:33:45,291 --> 01:33:46,333
I'll do it.

1735
01:33:47,041 --> 01:33:48,333
Arrange another vehicle.

1736
01:33:48,708 --> 01:33:50,000
There's no road there.

1737
01:33:50,083 --> 01:33:51,791
Only stones and sand.

1738
01:33:52,708 --> 01:33:54,833
-What do we do now?
-There it goes.

1739
01:33:54,916 --> 01:33:56,416
-Let's go.
-Hop on!

1740
01:33:57,375 --> 01:33:58,625
Let's go!

1741
01:33:59,458 --> 01:34:02,000
-Let's go.
-Oh, God.

1742
01:34:03,291 --> 01:34:04,750
-That's the vehicle, right?
-Yes.

1743
01:34:05,541 --> 01:34:07,000
Bro, stop.

1744
01:34:07,083 --> 01:34:09,041
-Stop the rickshaw.
-What is it?

1745
01:34:10,125 --> 01:34:11,583
CHINCHU.

1746
01:34:11,666 --> 01:34:12,875
Where did you drop
your last passenger?

1747
01:34:12,958 --> 01:34:15,541
-I dropped him at Lissy lodge.
-Okay.

1748
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:17,041
Abu, Lissy Lodge.

1749
01:34:17,125 --> 01:34:20,166
-Got it.
-Shall we go this way?

1750
01:34:22,083 --> 01:34:23,958
-Why don't you go tomorrow?
-Keep quiet.

1751
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,791
Send him the photos.

1752
01:34:26,916 --> 01:34:27,958
Let him calm down.

1753
01:34:28,041 --> 01:34:30,541
I'll send all that.
Please leave now.

1754
01:34:31,083 --> 01:34:32,250
Go!

1755
01:34:34,458 --> 01:34:36,166
Hey! Don't do anything wrong with her.

1756
01:34:36,250 --> 01:34:37,375
Get lost!

1757
01:34:47,666 --> 01:34:49,750
She can't control her words.

1758
01:35:08,791 --> 01:35:10,041
Didn't you have food?

1759
01:35:11,208 --> 01:35:12,916
Why should we go to Mangalapuram?

1760
01:35:15,625 --> 01:35:16,708
To Mangalapuram?

1761
01:35:18,458 --> 01:35:19,458
Well...

1762
01:35:21,833 --> 01:35:23,041
That wasn't decided.

1763
01:35:23,541 --> 01:35:26,333
She must have said that
thinking that she'll help us out.

1764
01:35:30,416 --> 01:35:33,458
I had told her that we're
meeting for the first time.

1765
01:35:36,166 --> 01:35:37,208
I want to go.

1766
01:35:37,375 --> 01:35:38,916
Drop me at the bus stand.

1767
01:35:40,541 --> 01:35:41,541
Already?

1768
01:35:44,500 --> 01:35:46,041
I have to go home, Vishnu.

1769
01:35:46,541 --> 01:35:47,791
You didn't even have food.

1770
01:35:48,333 --> 01:35:49,375
That's all right.

1771
01:35:49,916 --> 01:35:51,208
-It's all right.
-You can go after eating.

1772
01:35:51,291 --> 01:35:52,208
No!

1773
01:35:52,291 --> 01:35:54,458
-You can leave after eating.
-I'm not hungry, Vishnu.

1774
01:35:54,541 --> 01:35:56,708
-We can go after eating.
-I just want to go home.

1775
01:35:56,791 --> 01:35:57,958
-Leave me.
-Sit there, Jessy.

1776
01:35:58,083 --> 01:35:59,208
Sit down.

1777
01:36:00,916 --> 01:36:02,166
You just want to go
to the bus stand, right?

1778
01:36:02,416 --> 01:36:03,916
Look at me!

1779
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:05,791
You just want to go
to the bus stand, right?

1780
01:36:05,875 --> 01:36:07,875
I'll take you to the bus stand.

1781
01:36:08,166 --> 01:36:09,208
No, I...

1782
01:36:09,708 --> 01:36:11,875
Just wait for some time, Jessy.

1783
01:36:12,875 --> 01:36:15,541
We've waited for this moment.

1784
01:36:16,125 --> 01:36:18,083
When can we...

1785
01:36:18,166 --> 01:36:19,833
We will not get to be together.

1786
01:36:19,916 --> 01:36:21,041
Vishnu, leave me.

1787
01:36:21,833 --> 01:36:24,416
What? What's the problem?

1788
01:36:25,666 --> 01:36:27,250
What is it?

1789
01:36:28,291 --> 01:36:29,333
What happened?

1790
01:36:30,250 --> 01:36:31,125
Leave me.

1791
01:36:33,291 --> 01:36:36,500
-My hands are paining.
-That's because you're defending, right?

1792
01:36:37,666 --> 01:36:39,791
Your hands are paining
because you're defending, right?

1793
01:36:40,916 --> 01:36:43,000
Didn't I say that you
can go after some time?

1794
01:36:44,291 --> 01:36:46,250
Didn't I say that you
can go after some time?

1795
01:36:50,708 --> 01:36:53,416
Hey! We waited for
so many days, right?

1796
01:36:56,208 --> 01:36:57,166
Jessy, listen to me.

1797
01:36:57,500 --> 01:36:58,333
Listen to me.

1798
01:36:58,916 --> 01:36:59,750
Move.

1799
01:37:03,791 --> 01:37:04,916
Leave me.

1800
01:37:05,166 --> 01:37:07,250
Why are you getting scared?

1801
01:37:07,833 --> 01:37:09,958
-Why are you getting scared?
-I just wanted to see you.

1802
01:37:11,541 --> 01:37:13,083
But that's not enough for me.

1803
01:37:13,958 --> 01:37:14,875
Leave me.

1804
01:37:15,250 --> 01:37:16,875
It's not a problem. We can...

1805
01:37:18,708 --> 01:37:20,833
Don't be scared, Jessy.
We can go.

1806
01:37:23,333 --> 01:37:25,250
Isn't it starting?
Is the petrol over?

1807
01:37:25,416 --> 01:37:26,625
Let's ask there.

1808
01:37:29,500 --> 01:37:31,500
Hey! Where is this Lissy lodge?

1809
01:37:31,666 --> 01:37:33,958
-Over there.
-Come, I know the place.

1810
01:37:40,875 --> 01:37:42,583
Not a soul is here.

1811
01:37:42,708 --> 01:37:43,708
There!

1812
01:37:43,791 --> 01:37:46,000
Come on!

1813
01:37:47,666 --> 01:37:49,541
Jessy, why are you crying?

1814
01:37:49,625 --> 01:37:51,041
-Why are you crying?
-Leave me.

1815
01:37:51,125 --> 01:37:52,708
Leave me, Vishnu.

1816
01:37:54,583 --> 01:37:55,750
Leave me!

1817
01:37:55,833 --> 01:37:57,000
Hey!

1818
01:38:01,750 --> 01:38:03,250
Tell me!
Which room is it?

1819
01:38:03,500 --> 01:38:04,791
Which room is it?

1820
01:38:05,208 --> 01:38:06,875
-Which room?
-Over there.

1821
01:38:06,958 --> 01:38:08,250
Get lost.

1822
01:38:09,791 --> 01:38:11,500
Don't scream! I am warning you.

1823
01:38:36,083 --> 01:38:37,250
Why are you here?

1824
01:38:39,208 --> 01:38:41,166
Roy, you can do whatever you want to.
Then let's go.

1825
01:39:41,833 --> 01:39:43,083
Where is she?

1826
01:39:53,291 --> 01:39:55,208
Where is she? Tell me!

1827
01:39:55,291 --> 01:39:57,375
Where is she?
-Why do you care where she is?

1828
01:39:57,708 --> 01:39:59,500
She's not your sister, right?

1829
01:40:17,458 --> 01:40:20,375
-Where are you hiding her?
-I will not tell you!

1830
01:40:24,083 --> 01:40:26,458
They pulled me and
hit me on my face!

1831
01:40:28,625 --> 01:40:29,708
Who are you guys?

1832
01:40:29,791 --> 01:40:31,791
I am Abu. Roy is inside.
I don't know the other guy's name.

1833
01:40:31,875 --> 01:40:32,916
What's happening in there?

1834
01:40:33,208 --> 01:40:35,083
I heard them scream.

1835
01:40:35,166 --> 01:40:37,458
Who let him inside?

1836
01:40:37,875 --> 01:40:40,583
-Why are you shouting? Shut up and go.
-This can't happen here.

1837
01:40:40,666 --> 01:40:42,791
-I know what to do with you guys.
-What will you do?

1838
01:40:42,875 --> 01:40:44,125
Whom are you calling?

1839
01:40:44,375 --> 01:40:45,458
Call whoever you want to.

1840
01:40:45,541 --> 01:40:48,416
There is not a single person in
Kozhikode whom I don't know.

1841
01:40:48,500 --> 01:40:50,666
-This cannot happen here.
-Call! Go ahead!

1842
01:40:50,916 --> 01:40:52,041
What is it?

1843
01:40:52,583 --> 01:40:54,000
Call the police. That's better.

1844
01:40:55,666 --> 01:40:56,750
Aren't you calling?

1845
01:40:56,833 --> 01:40:59,250
My dear, this is just a small fight.
We'll leave now.

1846
01:40:59,458 --> 01:41:01,333
We'll finish this and leave now.
You can go!

1847
01:41:01,708 --> 01:41:03,041
Get going!

1848
01:41:06,250 --> 01:41:07,791
-Get lost!
-Okay.

1849
01:41:24,083 --> 01:41:25,625
Where is she?

1850
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:42,666
Where is she?

1851
01:41:42,750 --> 01:41:43,750
Tell me!

1852
01:41:44,666 --> 01:41:47,250
Tell me! Where is she?

1853
01:41:47,416 --> 01:41:48,875
Where is she?

1854
01:41:57,166 --> 01:41:58,291
Open it.

1855
01:41:59,541 --> 01:42:00,458
Open the door.

1856
01:42:01,583 --> 01:42:04,041
You will be safe. Open the door.

1857
01:42:05,875 --> 01:42:07,833
Don't be scared. Open the door.

1858
01:42:08,708 --> 01:42:10,916
Open the door, Jessy.

1859
01:42:13,833 --> 01:42:14,708
Hey!

1860
01:42:15,333 --> 01:42:16,166
Hey!

1861
01:42:21,958 --> 01:42:23,333
Abu!

1862
01:42:23,458 --> 01:42:24,583
Hey!

1863
01:42:25,291 --> 01:42:27,083
Open it.

1864
01:42:27,958 --> 01:42:29,583
Jessy, open the door.

1865
01:42:29,958 --> 01:42:31,708
I'm going to kick it open.

1866
01:42:36,958 --> 01:42:37,916
Come.

1867
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:39,875
No!

1868
01:42:40,250 --> 01:42:41,958
Don't be scared.
I'll drop you. Come.

1869
01:42:42,750 --> 01:42:44,791
You are safe with me.
Listen to me. Come!

1870
01:42:47,083 --> 01:42:48,375
Come!

1871
01:42:49,375 --> 01:42:50,833
Don't be afraid. Come.

1872
01:43:09,375 --> 01:43:11,000
Come with me.

1873
01:43:11,875 --> 01:43:12,750
You carry on.

1874
01:43:13,291 --> 01:43:14,375
I'll handle him.

1875
01:43:14,625 --> 01:43:15,875
Don't go.

1876
01:43:16,375 --> 01:43:17,333
You got some calls.

1877
01:43:17,416 --> 01:43:18,416
Okay.

1878
01:43:27,583 --> 01:43:28,833
Hello, Satheesh?

1879
01:43:29,291 --> 01:43:30,416
Come with your car.

1880
01:43:30,541 --> 01:43:32,333
We need to go to a place.

1881
01:44:01,375 --> 01:44:02,666
Hello, Nawaz. Tell me, bro!

1882
01:44:02,833 --> 01:44:05,083
Vishnu, you left in the morning, right?
Where are you?

1883
01:44:05,416 --> 01:44:07,041
<span style="style.center_1">I am at Kozhikode.</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Where are you?</span>

1884
01:44:07,125 --> 01:44:08,333
He is in Kozhikode, sir.

1885
01:44:09,333 --> 01:44:10,583
Ask him when he'll reach.

1886
01:44:10,833 --> 01:44:11,666
When will you reach?

1887
01:44:12,458 --> 01:44:13,416
Give it to me.

1888
01:44:16,750 --> 01:44:18,041
Sir, it got disconnected.

1889
01:44:18,666 --> 01:44:21,875
-Since how long has he been here?
-It's been five to eight months, sir.

1890
01:44:21,958 --> 01:44:24,958
I always had a doubt that
they were not his sisters.

1891
01:44:25,041 --> 01:44:26,208
-Sir.
-Yes.

1892
01:44:26,291 --> 01:44:29,083
He had asked me once if I was
interested in doing night trips.

1893
01:44:29,208 --> 01:44:30,708
-Don't say all that.
-Okay.

1894
01:44:33,458 --> 01:44:35,375
-Both are criminals.
-Will we have to go?

1895
01:44:36,583 --> 01:44:37,583
Sir.

1896
01:44:37,666 --> 01:44:38,750
She is with me.

1897
01:44:38,875 --> 01:44:39,833
I'll put her on.

1898
01:44:39,916 --> 01:44:41,333
<span style="style.center_1">Yeah. Do that.</span>

1899
01:44:45,500 --> 01:44:46,541
Here.

1900
01:44:47,041 --> 01:44:48,000
It's Annie.

1901
01:44:53,625 --> 01:44:55,416
I am Annie. Roy's cousin.

1902
01:44:55,750 --> 01:44:56,916
Are you okay, Jessy?

1903
01:44:59,375 --> 01:45:00,583
Such things keep happening.

1904
01:45:00,708 --> 01:45:02,458
Unexpected things would happen.

1905
01:45:02,541 --> 01:45:04,250
<span style="style.center_1">We might take time to</span>
<span style="style.center_1">identify the right people.</span>

1906
01:45:04,333 --> 01:45:07,000
<span style="style.center_1">I was sure that Roy</span>
<span style="style.center_1">will be able to help you.</span>

1907
01:45:07,750 --> 01:45:10,083
And it was me who asked him
not to complain to the police.

1908
01:45:10,666 --> 01:45:12,541
Why should we let people know?

1909
01:45:13,458 --> 01:45:14,458
So, tell me.

1910
01:45:14,541 --> 01:45:15,791
What's the next plan?

1911
01:45:20,833 --> 01:45:22,166
<span style="style.center_1">Why aren't you saying anything?</span>

1912
01:45:25,083 --> 01:45:26,041
Don't be sad.

1913
01:45:26,583 --> 01:45:27,958
No one knows this now.

1914
01:45:28,166 --> 01:45:29,458
That itself is a big deal.

1915
01:45:29,708 --> 01:45:32,708
Forget everything that happened
today, and get home quickly.

1916
01:45:33,625 --> 01:45:35,250
<span style="style.center_1">Can you put Roy on?</span>

1917
01:45:41,583 --> 01:45:43,291
Hey! Ask her if she had food.

1918
01:45:43,375 --> 01:45:44,375
<span style="style.center_1">Okay?</span>

1919
01:45:45,291 --> 01:45:47,416
I'll ask. Hang up and get lost.

1920
01:45:48,458 --> 01:45:51,625
-Don't hang up. I need to say something.
-<span style="style.center_1">What?</span>

1921
01:45:51,708 --> 01:45:53,458
Give some water
to that Bruce Lee.

1922
01:45:53,750 --> 01:45:54,875
-Annie.
-Yes.

1923
01:45:54,958 --> 01:45:56,208
Get me some water.

1924
01:46:04,041 --> 01:46:05,500
Do you want to have some food?

1925
01:46:06,541 --> 01:46:08,166
Do you have money
for the bus fare?

1926
01:46:18,125 --> 01:46:20,041
Will you show me the sea?

1927
01:46:20,875 --> 01:46:21,750
Why not!

1928
01:47:31,291 --> 01:47:32,458
Let's go.

1929
01:48:07,458 --> 01:48:09,625
Hey! Show them the new items.

1930
01:48:11,041 --> 01:48:11,833
Yes!

1931
01:48:12,666 --> 01:48:13,875
Check this out.

1932
01:48:16,333 --> 01:48:17,750
Two new designs are done.

1933
01:48:17,833 --> 01:48:19,458
I'll send them on
WhatsApp once I get home.

1934
01:48:19,708 --> 01:48:20,916
Here. Okay!

1935
01:48:24,750 --> 01:48:26,333
Everyone is curious.

1936
01:48:28,541 --> 01:48:30,000
You didn't say anything yet.

1937
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:32,916
I'll let you know.

1938
01:48:33,583 --> 01:48:34,583
Let's wait for the right time.

1939
01:48:34,916 --> 01:48:37,041
I'll be around. Bye.
