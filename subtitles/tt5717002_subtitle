1
00:00:01,875 --> 00:00:04,833
Sivaganga District

2
00:03:27,292 --> 00:03:29,333
Aren't they Siva and Abhi?

3
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:32,083
They're always at loggerheads.

4
00:03:32,292 --> 00:03:33,958
When I see them running together
holding their hands tightly,

5
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:35,458
are they going to marry?

6
00:03:35,667 --> 00:03:38,750
Oh my God!
Do his parents know this or not?

7
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:41,083
I'll go straight and
tell them right now.

8
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,708
3 hours earlier...

9
00:03:53,042 --> 00:03:58,208
Our dream and ambition is
our Abhirami's marriage.

10
00:03:58,417 --> 00:04:00,208
Bless, it happens as we wish.

11
00:04:04,667 --> 00:04:08,083
Brother, got broccoli.
- No broccolis today.

12
00:04:08,292 --> 00:04:12,500
Look brother, keep stock of all
the vegetables my son likes.

13
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:15,083
You mustn't say no stock,
warning you to keep what he likes, brother.

14
00:04:15,292 --> 00:04:19,292
You always say he likes this and that,
does he behave how we like him to be?

15
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,417
He will, trust him.

16
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:24,917
Hope...hope...hope is the life.
- For me?

17
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:49,458
Buddy!

18
00:04:51,042 --> 00:04:52,042
Buddy!

19
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:52,875
Tell me!

20
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:54,333
Tell me your girl friend's name.

21
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:56,417
No, dude.

22
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:58,708
Let me hear it from your mouth.

23
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:01,667
I love only her not her name.

24
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:02,542
Ride the bike properly.

25
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:08,333
Whatever you may say, eloping to marry
is more thrilling than arranged marriage.

26
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:11,875
What I feel is, letting boy friend into
home when no one else is in house.

27
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:13,958
That's more thrilling.

28
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:17,000
What are you saying? Then...?
- Oh no!

29
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:18,708
No way can it happen in my house.

30
00:05:18,917 --> 00:05:21,333
I feel like keep on hearing her name.

31
00:05:21,542 --> 00:05:23,792
Like your bike her name too
is quite old.

32
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,542
Ride bike without talking to me.

33
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:28,333
If a girl says I love you or
says okay to I love you,

34
00:05:28,542 --> 00:05:30,792
it means her bad time starts
from that very moment.

35
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,375
Why do you say like that?

36
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:35,417
Always express your love
on the day of marriage only.

37
00:05:35,417 --> 00:05:36,042
If not...?

38
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:40,917
If not, everything will happen before
what is supposed to happen after marriage.

39
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:43,833
How about you with Siva?

40
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,708
I didn't want to see her name
in invitation also,

41
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:49,250
that's why I decided
to elope and marry.

42
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:53,208
But you're taking my life by asking
her name every day 2000 times.

43
00:05:53,417 --> 00:05:57,042
For God's sake,
please don't ask her name, buddy.

44
00:05:57,417 --> 00:05:59,292
We've reached our meeting spot.

45
00:06:00,417 --> 00:06:02,500
Buddy, they're here before us.

46
00:06:02,667 --> 00:06:04,750
Thanks Abhi for bringing us
at right time.

47
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:07,375
Buddy, your girl has come ravishingly.

48
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:09,750
Say she's here, why that ravishingly!

49
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:11,792
Give the bag.
- Stop, buddy.

50
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,333
Stop! Where are you going?

51
00:06:13,542 --> 00:06:14,458
He's here!

52
00:06:14,667 --> 00:06:15,667
Where are we going to marry...

53
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,167
What are you saying, Siva?

54
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:20,625
Your father will pick a gun,
her father will pick a billhook!

55
00:06:20,792 --> 00:06:22,208
It's trouble from all sides.

56
00:06:22,417 --> 00:06:24,667
Get married in police station,
that's the safest place.

57
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:27,000
Are we getting married in temple?
- Yes.

58
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:30,667
No use of just love being divine,
marriage must also be divine.

59
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:31,958
Buddy, you're right.

60
00:06:32,167 --> 00:06:33,375
Go, get her.

61
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:35,625
Go, get your man.

62
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:45,833
Then, let's marry in temple.
- Let's marry in police station.

63
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:49,208
Let's marry in temple.
- No...no...in police station.

64
00:06:49,417 --> 00:06:50,667
No, in temple.

65
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:52,750
Just now Siva told me,
we're marrying in police station.

66
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:54,542
Just now Abhi told me,
we'll marry in temple.

67
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:56,958
It'll be trouble in temple,
let's marry in station.

68
00:06:57,167 --> 00:07:00,375
Why police station?
Are you both criminals?

69
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:01,583
You both are marrying in temple.

70
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,333
Go to temple, she'll get you
free food, have it fully.

71
00:07:04,542 --> 00:07:06,125
Bring her I say!
- Come, let's go.

72
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:08,250
Come, marriage is in temple only.

73
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:10,333
Marriage is in station, that's final.

74
00:07:10,542 --> 00:07:13,583
Why are you talking too much?
- What's that nonsense?

75
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:17,458
Marriage will happen in police station.
- In temple only!

76
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,708
Who are you to decide?
- Stop it, buddy.

77
00:07:20,917 --> 00:07:22,083
We both love each other.

78
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,958
Fearing our parents we had taken
a brave decision after 6 months.

79
00:07:25,167 --> 00:07:26,750
Seeing you both fight,
I think my father would've been better.

80
00:07:27,292 --> 00:07:29,417
Please listen to me.
- Leave it I say!

81
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:35,750
Thanks for what you did till now,
we'll elope to some place and marry.

82
00:07:35,917 --> 00:07:36,708
Give it.

83
00:07:36,917 --> 00:07:39,000
I'll get you married in temple,
come with me.

84
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,958
Buddy, you're getting married in station.

85
00:07:41,167 --> 00:07:43,542
Temple!
- Station!

86
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,333
We can go to home!

87
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,750
Father!

88
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:53,208
Buddy, her father is here.
What to do now?

89
00:07:53,417 --> 00:07:57,417
Buddy, elope with her to
some place and marry.

90
00:07:57,625 --> 00:08:01,167
That's what I said earlier.

91
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:04,875
Boys, cool buddies!

92
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:09,958
It seems my daughter will cheat
and run away from home.

93
00:08:10,167 --> 00:08:15,083
It seems her friends would
unite them in marriage.

94
00:08:15,292 --> 00:08:17,958
What are you watching, you fools?
Catch them!

95
00:08:18,167 --> 00:08:19,583
Come...let's run!

96
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,000
Hey you silly girl!
What are you watching there!

97
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:35,333
Goons are nearing us.
Come!

98
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:37,042
Dream....

99
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:39,583
I saw them...I saw them!

100
00:09:39,792 --> 00:09:40,833
What did you see?

101
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,042
Your son Siva and your daughter Abhi,
I saw them eloping together.

102
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:51,542
Didn't they understand what I said?

103
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:57,958
I saw your son and his daughter
running together holding hands.

104
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:01,250
I saw them happily...

105
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:02,667
You've a shop, right?

106
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,333
Mind your business,
I know about my son.

107
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,333
What do you know?
Is it false what I had seen?

108
00:10:06,542 --> 00:10:08,292
What did you see?

109
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,208
Infact we hope what you had
seen comes true.

110
00:10:09,417 --> 00:10:10,833
It has happened, right?

111
00:10:11,042 --> 00:10:12,625
Be happy!

112
00:10:12,792 --> 00:10:14,500
No chance.
- Why?

113
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:17,625
We know them since their birth.

114
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Labour Room

115
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:21,792
Madam, your due date is
first day of this month

116
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:24,167
Oh! I'll come into this world on first!

117
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,167
Madam, your due date is
20th day of this month.

118
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,625
What? 20th?
I'll not allow!

119
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:37,125
I'll come out first.
- No, I'm first.

120
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:38,500
Okay, you come first.

121
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:42,125
Why did you finish it abruptly?
Who was born first?

122
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:46,583
Who else? My daughter was first
to upstage her son.

123
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,292
One second earlier.

124
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,125
Oh God!

125
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:50,875
Ever since coming into this world
a second earlier,

126
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:54,042
she wants to upstage him
in everything.

127
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,250
They both will never take
a decision together.

128
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:57,667
Whatever he does,
she'll go against him.

129
00:10:57,833 --> 00:11:02,125
That's why we can't believe if you
say they ran together holding hands.

130
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:12,125
Stop....stop....catch them...

131
00:11:22,042 --> 00:11:22,667
Come fast!

132
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:25,042
Won't you fight with them?
You're running scared.

133
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:27,708
Leave me...come and thrash them.

134
00:11:27,917 --> 00:11:29,458
Thrash them? Come inside.

135
00:11:29,667 --> 00:11:32,500
What are you doing?
- Grandma, they're after us, don't tell.

136
00:11:35,792 --> 00:11:37,292
Hey old lady!
Did you see a boy and girl here?

137
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,833
Who are you?
- What?

138
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,208
Pedda Rayudu! Ask what they want!

139
00:11:41,417 --> 00:11:43,458
Brother! I think we crossed
into Andhra chasing them.

140
00:11:45,667 --> 00:11:46,667
Yes.

141
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:51,250
Brother, we must deal it differently.

142
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:53,000
Leave me...I'll go.

143
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:55,042
Please Abhi, listen to me.
- No way.

144
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,042
Let's go after they're gone.
- Should I listen if you tell me?

145
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,667
Leave me, I'll go.

146
00:11:59,042 --> 00:12:01,417
Let's have a tea and catch them.
- Leave me.

147
00:12:06,042 --> 00:12:06,792
What?

148
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:09,167
Won't you do anything?

149
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:12,500
I can!

150
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:38,250
Abhi, please listen to me.
Stop...- Go away!

151
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,375
Abhi, please listen to me.

152
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:44,167
Don't hit...its paining.
Leave me...

153
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:45,083
You...

154
00:12:51,167 --> 00:12:55,792
Come...come...catch him.
- Leave me...they may come.

155
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:57,250
He's running away,
let's catch him, brother.

156
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:00,583
Come and catch him.

157
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:01,833
Come on, boys.

158
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,125
Pay for tea.
- Keep it in brother's account, come.

159
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:06,042
Get in...

160
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:07,833
Tell me.

161
00:13:08,042 --> 00:13:10,125
Siva, we managed to escape.

162
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:11,125
Escaped?
- Yes.

163
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:12,917
Take her to some place and marry.

164
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:16,167
How can we go?
Dhoti and sacred thread is with you.

165
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:17,833
Yes, isn't it? Where are you now?

166
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,917
Trisoolam hills.
- Stay there, we will come..

167
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:31,208
Thank God, you saved my life.
- Sir, you must save me..

168
00:13:31,417 --> 00:13:32,750
Should I save you?
What are you saying?

169
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:35,000
They're after my life, sir.

170
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:37,083
Come, let's escape.

171
00:13:37,292 --> 00:13:40,042
You're a police officer.
- Police?

172
00:13:40,417 --> 00:13:41,083
Tell me the matter.

173
00:13:41,292 --> 00:13:42,708
We both are lovers.

174
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:45,500
They're trying to stop our marriage.
- Why are you lying to him?

175
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:51,792
Goons are waiting for us in vehicle,
he's the lone idiot here to save us.

176
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:52,792
We must use him.

177
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,917
Do you say like that?
- Yes, I do.

178
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:58,208
If so, first I'll deal with this idiot.

179
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:02,875
Sir, look at this!
You must tie the knot with me.

180
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:04,500
Arjuna Vel!

181
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:07,917
Though unexpected, don't miss
a chance coming your way!

182
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:10,583
If you miss this chance,
you can never marry in this life.

183
00:14:10,792 --> 00:14:12,125
Pick her up, boy!

184
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,625
Come, let's go.

185
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:15,375
Looks like you'll elope with her.

186
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:16,583
I'll elope only if you allow me.

187
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:20,292
She said about our marriage, sir.
- For you both?

188
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,500
Secret love affair, eloping to marry.

189
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:26,292
Okay, who is your father?
- Jayavelu, sir.

190
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,750
Jayavelu? Which Jayavelu?

191
00:14:27,917 --> 00:14:31,458
JK Art Gallery Jayavelu, sir.
- Is it him?

192
00:14:31,667 --> 00:14:33,750
I'll call him now.

193
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:37,167
If you say one more word,
I'll call Inspector.

194
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:39,458
Hearing about your torture,
he himself has called on phone.

195
00:14:39,667 --> 00:14:40,417
Wait a second.

196
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:41,917
Why are you calling police
for this, brother?

197
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:44,458
Hello! Is it Jayavelu sir?

198
00:14:44,667 --> 00:14:47,167
Sir...
- Your son here...

199
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:50,625
Siva and...
- Abhi!

200
00:14:50,792 --> 00:14:52,042
It seems they're going to get married.

201
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:55,917
Is it true what Murugan says?

202
00:14:56,167 --> 00:14:57,417
Shall I take them to police station?

203
00:14:57,625 --> 00:15:01,625
Don’t do it sir,
please send them to home, sir.

204
00:15:01,792 --> 00:15:05,542
Infact it's our dream and
wish to get them married.

205
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:09,292
We'll give our entire property
to you, sir.

206
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,000
We'll arrange their marriage,
please, you don't do it, sir.

207
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:13,417
Please, for God's sake.

208
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:16,708
I'll offer you sugar in kilos,
please bring the kids to home.

209
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:20,292
I'm totally confused.
- I don't know what to say!

210
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,417
No words to say,
please bring children to home.

211
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:25,083
Shall we run over them?

212
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:27,833
Come on, run over them.

213
00:15:36,417 --> 00:15:39,958
Why didn't you run over them?
Why?

214
00:15:40,167 --> 00:15:41,958
He's traffic Inspector.

215
00:15:42,167 --> 00:15:45,000
Insurance is not yet renewed,
if get caught we'll have cough up fine.

216
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:47,625
Thank God! Is it over?
- They're gone.

217
00:15:47,792 --> 00:15:48,958
Gone?

218
00:15:49,167 --> 00:15:49,750
Finished, sir.

219
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:50,583
Have you understood what I said, sir?

220
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:54,750
Sir, I understood clearly
whatever you said.

221
00:15:58,167 --> 00:16:01,167
Hey, come here.
- Brother!

222
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:03,250
Come closer I say!

223
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:07,083
Just now you were laughing.
- I said come closer.

224
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,083
Muruga! You gave damn good news!

225
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,375
Why are you just watching, Rajalakshmi?

226
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:17,208
How can I...?
- I didn't mean that.

227
00:16:17,417 --> 00:16:22,125
Let's distribute sweets to
entire town to celebrate this!

228
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:24,042
Let's celebrate!

229
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:26,458
Both are going home,
parents will arrange your marriage.

230
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:28,625
Marriage?
- Home? No way!

231
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:31,167
No need, grant me divorce.
- I must get the divorce first.

232
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:33,917
I must get divorce first.
- I must get it first.

233
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:36,625
I helped this idiot.
- I showed him sacred thread.

234
00:16:36,792 --> 00:16:39,542
I ran into him.
- He wanted to marry me.

235
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:40,333
No way.

236
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:42,375
I planned it.
- First I must get divorce.

237
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:44,000
First to me.
- First to me.

238
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:46,583
First to me!
- Who are you? First to me.

239
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:47,917
Who is it?
- Who should get it first, sir?

240
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:51,167
You both are not married yet,
but you want divorce.

241
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:52,583
That's why we're seeking divorce.

242
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:57,542
Marry today and seek divorce tomorrow.
That's the trend.

243
00:16:57,708 --> 00:17:00,167
Never go against rules.
Got it? Go now.

244
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:04,333
Yes sir, as I had wished, my daughter eloped
with a boy from opposite home.

245
00:17:04,542 --> 00:17:05,125
What?

246
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:08,583
My son eloped with opposite home girl.
- Is it?

247
00:17:08,792 --> 00:17:10,958
What a courageous girl Abhi is!

248
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:13,333
At the first opportunity,
she eloped with my son.

249
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:20,542
It seems a young girl and young boy
from our street have eloped...

250
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:27,042
Stop...stop...

251
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:29,042
It's not a matter to raise hue and cry.

252
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:32,125
It's a matter to feel happy
and celebrate.

253
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:33,417
Hey boys! Play music!

254
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:42,875
Fire crackers...

255
00:17:43,042 --> 00:17:46,125
Sparkle to catch them...

256
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:49,500
Celebrate with great fanfare...

257
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:52,417
Play lilting music...

258
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:58,375
Eloped...eloped...

259
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:01,208
They eloped...

260
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:08,917
My daughter and
your son have eloped...

261
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:15,833
We're here to spread the news
happily with everyone...

262
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,083
We didn't invite anyone
with wedding invitations...

263
00:18:19,292 --> 00:18:22,292
We didn't put up festoon of
banana plants at our threshold...

264
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,583
We didn't paste posters
with bride and groom's photos...

265
00:18:25,792 --> 00:18:29,667
We're extremely happy
for their elopement...

266
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:05,000
We'll show green signal
to our children's love...

267
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:08,208
We'll bless our daughter
who has eloped...

268
00:19:08,417 --> 00:19:11,542
Mother's heart is happy on
hearing son's elopement...

269
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:15,625
Happy to share this
happiness with everyone...

270
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:24,417
We've kids who made us
proud in this town...

271
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,042
As evil may cast evil eye on them...

272
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,750
May cast evil eye on them...

273
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:31,542
They joined together
to ward off everything...

274
00:19:59,417 --> 00:20:02,500
Got a son-in-law to feel proud of...

275
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:05,792
He eloped with the girl he loved...

276
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:09,000
They have heir to feel proud of...

277
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:13,000
Two hearts united to become three...

278
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,167
They didn't go to watch films
or to parks...

279
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:21,875
They didn't paint town red on bike...

280
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:25,167
No gossips...no sweet nothings....
- No gentle touches...

281
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:29,000
Without getting any spoilt or ruining,
they have united...

282
00:21:06,667 --> 00:21:07,458
Take it.

283
00:21:10,042 --> 00:21:11,875
Here comes the eloped bride!

284
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:14,583
Yes, sister who eloped has
returned home.

285
00:21:14,792 --> 00:21:16,833
Sister, you've come alone,
where's brother-in-law?

286
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:21,167
Sister is picking stone,
let's run away, boys.

287
00:21:43,042 --> 00:21:48,250
Siva, the way you were running away,
I expected you'd return with child.

288
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:51,000
Both are like wrestlers in arena.

289
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:55,000
Eloped couple is back!

290
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,417
What's this?
- What happened, dear?

291
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:02,833
Oh silly girl.
- She's asking, answer her.

292
00:22:03,042 --> 00:22:04,125
Son-in-law!

293
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:05,417
Clear out...clear out, please.

294
00:22:05,542 --> 00:22:06,375
Hey new groom! Great!

295
00:22:06,542 --> 00:22:08,750
It's rare occasion,
bride and groom stand together.

296
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:09,792
Come.
- Get lost

297
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,542
Who will marry her?
Leave me, father.

298
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,500
How dare you!

299
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:15,375
She may hurt you, son.

300
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:17,458
I'll gouge your eyes.
- Get lost.

301
00:22:17,667 --> 00:22:21,542
Should I marry her?
- Don't talk like that.

302
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:25,458
You're a brinjal with hands and legs!
How dare you talk like that!

303
00:22:25,667 --> 00:22:26,792
We mustn't spare her.

304
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,500
Don't worry if he calls you brinjal,
there's still time for you to grow.

305
00:22:30,708 --> 00:22:34,542
Is brinjal important now?
- Leave me, father.

306
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:35,750
What's this, dear?

307
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:39,750
We thought you both eloped
and married.

308
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:42,875
Would anyone dare marry?

309
00:22:43,083 --> 00:22:44,292
Crazy thing!
Look at her damn face!

310
00:22:44,458 --> 00:22:45,542
I'll break your teeth.

311
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,708
Dear, never call husband informally.

312
00:22:47,917 --> 00:22:49,958
That's why he has scratched you badly.

313
00:22:50,167 --> 00:22:55,542
Trusting you both,
we sang a film song too.- Shut up!

314
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:59,375
Please tell me, what had happened?

315
00:22:59,583 --> 00:23:01,625
Had we married according to my plan,
we would've a child by now!

316
00:23:01,833 --> 00:23:04,458
Buddy, I'm here with new plan.
- First give me the bag

317
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:06,125
We'll go to some place
and marry somehow.

318
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:07,375
Please leave us alone.

319
00:23:07,542 --> 00:23:08,833
Buddy, please listen to me.
- Stop.

320
00:23:09,042 --> 00:23:11,708
Go to Central station catch a train
and marry in Andhra.

321
00:23:11,917 --> 00:23:14,250
No need of that, go to Koyambedu,
catch a bus,

322
00:23:14,417 --> 00:23:16,250
go to Madurai and
marry in some temple there.

323
00:23:16,417 --> 00:23:17,917
Buddy, listen to me,
let's go Andhra.

324
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:21,125
We're going to Madurai.
- Why not go to home?

325
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:22,500
Father!

326
00:23:26,708 --> 00:23:29,875
Her father has come here also.

327
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:32,458
Tell me now, where should we go?
To Madurai or to Andhra?

328
00:23:32,667 --> 00:23:36,125
Buddy, no time to go to Madurai
or Andhra.

329
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:38,083
Go to some place and marry.

330
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,625
I said this earlier too.

331
00:23:43,417 --> 00:23:45,125
Isn't the climate very pleasant?

332
00:23:48,083 --> 00:23:53,750
How dare you elope with
my daughter to marry her?

333
00:23:54,292 --> 00:23:56,500
What's your name?

334
00:23:57,333 --> 00:23:58,500
Bhagat Singh.

335
00:24:03,917 --> 00:24:04,875
What? Singh?

336
00:24:05,083 --> 00:24:07,458
How dare you! Come with me.

337
00:24:08,417 --> 00:24:10,083
To hell with your love!
- It's not Su.

338
00:24:10,292 --> 00:24:11,708
It's Azhagiya Vadivudaya Sundarambal.

339
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:13,833
Is it very important now?
Leave me.

340
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:28,958
Bloody sinners!

341
00:24:29,292 --> 00:24:34,042
Had we gone as planned instead of listening
to you we would've eloped by now.

342
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:40,458
Promising to get us married, you both
fought and separated us, bloody idiots.

343
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,958
Brother, Su!
- Come, boy.

344
00:24:50,167 --> 00:24:51,833
Your army father will
take care of everything.

345
00:24:52,792 --> 00:24:54,417
I want Su!

346
00:24:55,083 --> 00:24:56,292
Get out...get out.

347
00:24:56,458 --> 00:24:58,042
I'll fall down.
- Get down.

348
00:24:58,250 --> 00:24:59,792
Come out, sir.
Get down...get down.

349
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,250
Nasty customers.

350
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:04,250
My friend's love failed because of you.
- My friend love failed because of you.

351
00:25:04,417 --> 00:25:05,917
How can I not get involved
in my friend's love...

352
00:25:06,125 --> 00:25:07,375
How dare you push me while talking?

353
00:25:07,583 --> 00:25:09,667
How dare you hit me!
- What will you do?

354
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:11,833
They got separated because of you.

355
00:25:12,042 --> 00:25:13,708
What a nasty idea you gave!

356
00:25:13,917 --> 00:25:15,833
Haven't they yet gone to home?

357
00:25:16,042 --> 00:25:18,292
Gives nasty idea!
- I'll kill you.

358
00:25:20,458 --> 00:25:21,417
Oh no!

359
00:25:21,625 --> 00:25:22,458
What's this, brother-in-law?

360
00:25:22,667 --> 00:25:25,250
Did we wish them to become
doctor and engineer?

361
00:25:25,417 --> 00:25:27,958
All we wished that they get married
and live happily, right?

362
00:25:28,167 --> 00:25:32,083
You eloped with him but returned mid-way,
were you born to do this, my dear?

363
00:25:32,292 --> 00:25:33,250
Why did you do like this?

364
00:25:33,375 --> 00:25:39,208
How happy I was hearing that
your son eloped with my daughter!

365
00:25:39,375 --> 00:25:42,542
We had only one son and
I was happy at last he had reformed.

366
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:47,000
You left her mid-way after
eloping with her, you sinner.

367
00:25:49,792 --> 00:25:54,125
Oh no! Your father's head
hung down with shame.

368
00:25:54,292 --> 00:25:56,250
You made your father to hang
his head in shame in public.

369
00:25:56,417 --> 00:26:00,125
You humiliated your father in public.
What am I to do now?

370
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:03,583
We celebrated by distributing sweets
hearing about your elopement.

371
00:26:03,792 --> 00:26:05,208
Now, we feel insulted.

372
00:26:05,375 --> 00:26:07,250
Why did you do like this?

373
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:11,500
Hubby!

374
00:26:12,083 --> 00:26:20,167
So many problems for parents
because of children's love!

375
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,042
This is your great grandfather,
he eloped with a Gujarati girl and married her.

376
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:26,750
Your grandfather kidnapped
a Marathi girl and married her.

377
00:26:26,958 --> 00:26:30,000
Your father eloped with a Bengali girl
and married her.

378
00:26:30,208 --> 00:26:33,333
You too kidnapped my mother
from Bombay to marry her, right?

379
00:26:33,542 --> 00:26:36,500
This is our family tradition since
many generations, right?

380
00:26:36,708 --> 00:26:39,833
Why shouldn't I elope with my lover?
- No.

381
00:26:40,042 --> 00:26:42,875
I want only a Tamil as my son-in-law.

382
00:26:43,083 --> 00:26:44,167
Not a Sikh.

383
00:26:44,333 --> 00:26:47,708
Only his name is Bhagat Singh.
- Lock her in a room.

384
00:26:47,917 --> 00:26:48,292
Okay, boss.

385
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:55,542
Look, I'm a smuggler of antique idols,
not a big deal to find you.

386
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:56,958
Take her inside.

387
00:27:01,292 --> 00:27:03,125
Go inside.
- Yuck!

388
00:27:08,292 --> 00:27:09,292
Tell me, uncle.

389
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,792
Siva is regretting.

390
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,125
What's it?

391
00:27:13,292 --> 00:27:15,167
It seems he hit you on road.

392
00:27:16,375 --> 00:27:20,292
You do one thing, come here
and seek forgiveness from him.

393
00:27:21,208 --> 00:27:24,792
Uncle, he hit me.
Why should I seek his forgiveness?

394
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,125
Moreover I'm elder to him
by a second.

395
00:27:27,292 --> 00:27:29,583
He doesn't have that respect too.

396
00:27:33,667 --> 00:27:38,833
Uncle, as you think your son Siva
is not a good boy or honest.

397
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,833
He's a rogue.

398
00:27:41,042 --> 00:27:43,083
He's a real...

399
00:27:47,792 --> 00:27:49,250
She's abusing wildly.

400
00:27:49,458 --> 00:27:54,125
Where's my phone, Rajalakshmi?

401
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:55,500
Phone...is it here?

402
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:57,250
Who is on line?

403
00:27:57,458 --> 00:27:58,667
It's Abhi!

404
00:27:58,875 --> 00:27:59,917
Tell me, Abhi!

405
00:28:00,125 --> 00:28:02,833
Tell me, dear.
No, don't do it, boy.

406
00:28:03,042 --> 00:28:04,833
Don't make me shout with wild abuses.

407
00:28:05,042 --> 00:28:07,250
Do you realize who are
you're talking to, dear?

408
00:28:07,458 --> 00:28:13,208
I know very well what a rascal
and item you are!

409
00:28:13,417 --> 00:28:14,417
Item?

410
00:28:14,625 --> 00:28:18,042
How dare you try to cheat me!
Wait, I'm coming there.

411
00:28:18,208 --> 00:28:23,042
Hey, if you're really a man,
stay put without cutting the call.

412
00:28:23,208 --> 00:28:24,708
I'm coming right now.

413
00:28:24,917 --> 00:28:28,625
How dare! I'm elder to you by a second.

414
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:32,042
You're abusing me, dear.

415
00:28:35,208 --> 00:28:36,458
Uncle!

416
00:28:37,917 --> 00:28:40,375
Sorry uncle, please forgive me, uncle.

417
00:28:40,583 --> 00:28:41,583
No problem, dear.

418
00:28:41,792 --> 00:28:43,833
You abused your uncle, right?

419
00:28:44,417 --> 00:28:48,167
You're going to be my daughter-in-law,
please don't cry, dear.

420
00:28:48,375 --> 00:28:51,792
I'm your uncle, right?
I'll not take it seriously.

421
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,917
Please uncle...please...
- Go, dear...go...

422
00:28:58,792 --> 00:29:03,333
Leaving out cheating,
have you started mimicking my voice?

423
00:29:03,542 --> 00:29:05,167
Item boy!

424
00:29:08,167 --> 00:29:10,792
Are you selling hen in
a village where it is banned?

425
00:29:11,042 --> 00:29:13,917
There's a board in village
not to sell hen or eggs here.

426
00:29:14,083 --> 00:29:15,833
It's an order of God,
do you know it or not?

427
00:29:16,042 --> 00:29:18,000
Why the hell did you come here
to sell hen?

428
00:29:18,167 --> 00:29:19,417
Why are you talking to him?

429
00:29:19,625 --> 00:29:21,333
I came without seeing the board,
please forgive me, sir.

430
00:29:21,542 --> 00:29:24,458
Throw out him and his hen beyond
the boundary of this village.

431
00:29:24,667 --> 00:29:27,958
Sir, please leave me,
I've kids to look after, sir.

432
00:29:28,125 --> 00:29:33,000
Hey hen! They're just kids that side,
they'll just bash you.

433
00:29:33,167 --> 00:29:37,250
If you dare step this side,
we'll kill you.

434
00:29:42,542 --> 00:29:45,167
Will you dare ask?
- No, I'll not ask.

435
00:29:45,375 --> 00:29:46,958
What's the problem?

436
00:29:47,292 --> 00:29:48,792
He's from neighbouring village,
he came for lunch, sir.

437
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,083
Will you bash a guest
who is here for lunch?

438
00:29:51,292 --> 00:29:52,333
He's asking for egg, sir.

439
00:29:52,542 --> 00:29:53,125
Kill him...kill him.

440
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:56,625
Will you ask egg? Will you ask?
- Sir, I'll not ask...I'll not ask...

441
00:29:59,875 --> 00:30:01,125
Tell me, Maya.
Are you doing fine?

442
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:02,083
Not fine, brother.

443
00:30:02,292 --> 00:30:03,625
It's not good whatever
you're doing, brother.

444
00:30:03,833 --> 00:30:06,583
Didn't you find Jayavelu yet?
- I'm still searching for him.

445
00:30:06,792 --> 00:30:12,958
Our leader grandma is holding her last breath
to see Jayavelu sacrificed at the altar.

446
00:30:13,125 --> 00:30:17,125
What are you going to do? Tell if you can't,
we'll come there to find him.

447
00:30:17,333 --> 00:30:18,958
Stop it.

448
00:30:19,125 --> 00:30:23,500
Is it my fate to live here with wife
and child leaving my native place?

449
00:30:23,708 --> 00:30:25,708
The same bloodline runs in my body too.

450
00:30:25,917 --> 00:30:28,750
Time will come to sacrifice life for
family honour, till then, be patient.

451
00:30:28,958 --> 00:30:31,542
How long can I be patient?
- Cut the call.

452
00:30:32,292 --> 00:30:34,542
Who is it? Cousin?
- Yes, brother-in-law.

453
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:37,458
He wants...
- My cousin called morning said same thing.

454
00:30:37,667 --> 00:30:39,042
Somehow I managed him.

455
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:42,333
We've been managing for so many years,
what if they come here thirsting for blood?

456
00:30:42,542 --> 00:30:44,042
We'll manage them.

457
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:46,458
Master Marthandam Yoga School

458
00:30:54,458 --> 00:30:56,750
What are we going to do today
for world's welfare?

459
00:30:56,958 --> 00:30:58,875
We're snatching gold chains
of few people.

460
00:30:59,083 --> 00:31:01,083
It'll weigh about 15 sovereigns.

461
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:03,083
Tied up Kumar is in car.

462
00:31:03,292 --> 00:31:06,458
If we hand over him to the party at
appointed place on Bangalore Highway.

463
00:31:06,625 --> 00:31:08,083
We'll get Rs.25 lakhs.

464
00:31:08,292 --> 00:31:12,833
Boss, I've selected 10 rich people from
the friend requests you got in Facebook.

465
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,792
Accept one by one as friend.

466
00:31:14,958 --> 00:31:19,625
One who replies thanks,
call and kidnap him.

467
00:31:19,833 --> 00:31:22,708
After kidnapping him,
make him unfriend in Facebook.

468
00:31:22,917 --> 00:31:26,833
Because there mustn't be any
evidence in our business of kidnap.

469
00:31:27,833 --> 00:31:30,917
I'm master here, boss in that place.

470
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,875
Idol from Rajarajan's times.

471
00:31:34,917 --> 00:31:36,208
Check and make a generous payment.

472
00:31:36,417 --> 00:31:38,000
I've checked it.

473
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:40,667
Let's fix the deal.

474
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:46,250
Don't talk too much.

475
00:31:46,458 --> 00:31:50,750
Pull over the car and...
- Master, police are checking cars.

476
00:31:52,583 --> 00:31:55,792
If they check, all of us may
get caught, get down.

477
00:31:55,917 --> 00:31:58,958
Shall I untie Kumar, master?

478
00:31:59,875 --> 00:32:03,292
If I hit on head, you'll bleed to death.

479
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,625
Hide kidnapped Kumar behind that shop.

480
00:32:06,833 --> 00:32:08,458
Let's think what to do later.

481
00:32:13,542 --> 00:32:15,833
Lift him carefully.
Careful...careful...

482
00:32:16,375 --> 00:32:20,417
Sir, I told you that leader...
- I'm telling you, right?

483
00:32:20,625 --> 00:32:23,167
Master, we've hidden him.
- Nobody can see it, right?

484
00:32:23,375 --> 00:32:24,792
Sure, master.

485
00:32:25,375 --> 00:32:27,875
Brother, police are there.
Let's go back, brother.

486
00:32:28,083 --> 00:32:30,167
If we go back now, it may raise doubt.

487
00:32:30,375 --> 00:32:32,958
Why are you staring at me?
You pig, behave normally.

488
00:32:33,833 --> 00:32:37,792
Isn't it Master Marthandam standing there?
- Yes, brother.

489
00:32:37,917 --> 00:32:42,792
He's smart guy, he'll somehow manage
to escape, keep our stock in his car.

490
00:32:42,958 --> 00:32:45,375
After crossing check post,
let's waylay and take our things.

491
00:32:45,583 --> 00:32:46,583
Okay, brother.

492
00:32:47,167 --> 00:32:48,042
Get in.

493
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:53,792
Leaving the place it is there,
searching in place where it is not there...

494
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:00,458
Do it quickly before they see us.

495
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:03,417
Slowly...slowly, keep it inside.

496
00:33:08,875 --> 00:33:10,250
Brother, we kept it inside.

497
00:33:13,917 --> 00:33:16,500
Shift kidnapped Kumar to Kasi's vehicle.

498
00:33:16,708 --> 00:33:20,000
He's big shot, he'll somehow
manage to escape.

499
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:22,583
After crossing the check post,
waylay him...

500
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:24,750
Don't look that side.
- Okay, master.

501
00:33:24,917 --> 00:33:26,208
We can get back kidnapped Kumar.

502
00:33:26,417 --> 00:33:27,875
Good idea, master.

503
00:33:28,792 --> 00:33:30,958
If you apple polish me,
I'll break your limbs.

504
00:33:31,167 --> 00:33:33,417
Do silently what I told you.
Go.

505
00:33:37,417 --> 00:33:39,417
Careful...slowly...

506
00:33:44,833 --> 00:33:46,500
Stop...stop...stop...

507
00:33:50,958 --> 00:33:53,708
Master! No checks for you, go.

508
00:33:53,875 --> 00:33:57,875
They say in hospital that master
needs no master check up.

509
00:33:59,375 --> 00:34:00,583
Let him go.

510
00:34:08,375 --> 00:34:09,458
Check the vehicle.

511
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:11,375
What's in the vehicle?

512
00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:14,500
We're there.
- Yes, sir...trust us.

513
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,250
What happened?
- Bag, sir.

514
00:34:21,458 --> 00:34:22,500
Open it.

515
00:34:30,875 --> 00:34:32,500
Tested? Okay?

516
00:34:34,667 --> 00:34:36,250
Kidnap case!

517
00:34:36,458 --> 00:34:38,333
We didn't kidnap him.
- Yes, isn't it?

518
00:34:38,542 --> 00:34:39,458
Then, who kidnapped him?

519
00:34:39,667 --> 00:34:42,000
He didn't kidnap me, sir.

520
00:34:43,667 --> 00:34:48,292
Looks like I'm in deep
trouble unnecessarily.

521
00:34:56,708 --> 00:34:59,000
We gave up Kumar, lost the idol also.

522
00:34:59,208 --> 00:35:02,000
If we don't do anything,
many may die in hunger.

523
00:35:05,833 --> 00:35:06,792
He?

524
00:35:11,833 --> 00:35:13,208
Where's my idol?

525
00:35:13,708 --> 00:35:15,042
I'll tell if you remove billhook
from my neck.

526
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:16,333
Tell me.

527
00:35:17,042 --> 00:35:18,917
It's not with me.
- Where is it?

528
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,667
This idol is from Rajaraja Chola's times.
- Is it?

529
00:35:30,083 --> 00:35:32,292
Where did you find this idol?
- It was in my car.

530
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,167
Car means?
- My car.

531
00:35:35,792 --> 00:35:36,500
Papers?

532
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:39,083
Would I be this far in car
without papers?

533
00:35:39,292 --> 00:35:42,292
Boys, get RC book and
insurance papers.

534
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,208
Okay, master.

535
00:35:43,417 --> 00:35:46,958
Master, I asked papers and
documents for this idol.

536
00:35:47,167 --> 00:35:48,625
I don't know about it.

537
00:35:48,792 --> 00:35:51,667
If you tell me the price,
I'll give idol and walk out happily.

538
00:35:54,083 --> 00:35:55,167
I got you.

539
00:35:59,708 --> 00:36:01,542
Why are you calling police?

540
00:36:01,708 --> 00:36:03,333
Stolen idol.
- God's idol.

541
00:36:03,542 --> 00:36:04,917
Stolen idol.
- No, God's idol.

542
00:36:05,125 --> 00:36:06,333
Let police come and decide that.

543
00:36:06,542 --> 00:36:11,542
What's this trouble?
- I'm not an antique smuggler.

544
00:36:11,708 --> 00:36:14,583
I kidnap only humans.
- Then, I must call police.

545
00:36:15,958 --> 00:36:17,417
I called them.
- Go...go...

546
00:36:17,625 --> 00:36:19,000
Go out, boys.

547
00:36:21,542 --> 00:36:22,625
Are they gone?

548
00:36:23,958 --> 00:36:26,917
Hello, my King...real Tamil...
best among men!

549
00:36:27,125 --> 00:36:28,125
Leave my hand.
- I'm innocent man.

550
00:36:28,333 --> 00:36:30,583
I don't have any connection
with this idol.

551
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:32,250
Do whatever with this idol.

552
00:36:32,458 --> 00:36:38,708
If you need any help,
call this number.

553
00:36:39,417 --> 00:36:42,583
I'll kidnap someone for you
at damn cheap rate.

554
00:36:42,917 --> 00:36:45,250
Did you keep it there?

555
00:36:45,458 --> 00:36:47,583
He's troublesome guy.

556
00:36:53,083 --> 00:36:54,542
Look at this! Our idol!

557
00:36:54,708 --> 00:36:55,958
Take it.

558
00:36:56,083 --> 00:36:58,125
Hands off it.

559
00:36:58,875 --> 00:37:01,750
Oh! Local landlord!

560
00:37:01,958 --> 00:37:07,792
The moment I saw the idol, I knew no thief
would've stolen this idol other than you.

561
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,125
No Jayavelu, our professions are different.

562
00:37:11,333 --> 00:37:12,083
Don't cross my path.

563
00:37:12,292 --> 00:37:15,500
You're a traitor stealing idols,
are you talking about profession with me?

564
00:37:15,667 --> 00:37:16,500
Who is traitor?

565
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:17,958
Smuggle to realize how difficult it is.

566
00:37:18,167 --> 00:37:20,625
You spread culture here and
I'm spreading it overseas.

567
00:37:20,875 --> 00:37:21,500
In dollars!

568
00:37:21,625 --> 00:37:23,750
Don't you feel cheap to say it?

569
00:37:23,958 --> 00:37:26,667
You're selling tradition for money.
I'm protecting it.

570
00:37:26,875 --> 00:37:30,958
Protect culture and traditions.
But please return the idol.

571
00:37:31,167 --> 00:37:33,958
I've informed police about this idol.

572
00:37:34,167 --> 00:37:36,583
I'll hand over it to police,
you can take it from them.

573
00:37:36,792 --> 00:37:41,125
Why are you going to police?
Why not settle it between us?

574
00:37:42,417 --> 00:37:46,625
You're not qualified to stand before me,
how dare you fix a price on me?

575
00:37:50,083 --> 00:37:51,667
We'll meet again!

576
00:37:53,708 --> 00:37:54,667
Come on, boys.

577
00:37:57,875 --> 00:38:00,167
Buddy...buddy...

578
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,708
Listen to me, please.

579
00:38:06,833 --> 00:38:11,750
Fall in love but never ever seek
the help of your friend.

580
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:14,458
A friend is responsible for
the separation from my love.

581
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:15,833
That too...

582
00:38:18,583 --> 00:38:21,417
The man about whom I was talking
to you, he's calling!

583
00:38:21,583 --> 00:38:24,375
I had blacklisted his name, right?
- Blacklist?

584
00:38:24,542 --> 00:38:25,917
I must change my SIM card.

585
00:38:26,125 --> 00:38:28,875
I thought with Siva's help
I would unite with my love.

586
00:38:29,083 --> 00:38:31,417
Arguing with his girl,
my love got....

587
00:38:31,583 --> 00:38:33,417
Forget it, buddy.
We friends are there for you, right?

588
00:38:33,583 --> 00:38:36,792
No need...I don't want any friend.

589
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:42,167
Let my love be the first love united
without any help from any friend.

590
00:38:42,375 --> 00:38:50,417
In 6 months from now,
I and my love would be enjoying life...

591
00:38:53,083 --> 00:38:55,083
Would you please tell your lover's name?

592
00:38:57,333 --> 00:38:58,208
Who are you?

593
00:38:58,458 --> 00:39:01,167
It's been many days
since I heard your lover's name.

594
00:39:01,375 --> 00:39:04,667
I don't know you.
Why are you asking my lover's name?

595
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:07,375
Why he gets tensed if you
ask his lover's name?

596
00:39:07,542 --> 00:39:08,958
Keep quiet.

597
00:39:09,167 --> 00:39:12,000
His lover's name is...
- Don't tell.

598
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:15,208
Sundarambal!
- Sundarambal?

599
00:39:15,542 --> 00:39:19,625
Not just Sundarambal,
Azhagiya Vadivudaya Sundarambal.

600
00:39:19,833 --> 00:39:21,292
Full name too!

601
00:39:21,833 --> 00:39:25,583
Isn't it great name?
- Are you happy?

602
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:28,917
Why are you giggling, boys?
Ask him to pay for juice.

603
00:39:29,125 --> 00:39:33,250
Buddy....please stop.

604
00:39:33,417 --> 00:39:34,833
What do you want?

605
00:39:35,042 --> 00:39:36,417
Are you angry for separating your love?

606
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:39,167
The love which you think got
separated because of me,

607
00:39:39,375 --> 00:39:41,292
I will unite you with your lover.

608
00:39:41,458 --> 00:39:44,125
No way, I can manage
my ex-army man father too..

609
00:39:44,333 --> 00:39:46,417
But her father Kasi is not
as we think.

610
00:39:46,625 --> 00:39:50,708
I'll take on Kasi face to face
for your sake.

611
00:39:50,958 --> 00:39:54,917
If you go there,
the problem may take a turn.

612
00:39:57,417 --> 00:39:59,167
Just do what I say!

613
00:40:03,125 --> 00:40:05,917
Brother, I saw those boys.

614
00:40:06,083 --> 00:40:10,375
From their talk I feel they're
planning something big, brother.

615
00:40:10,583 --> 00:40:12,292
Girl is under house arrest,

616
00:40:12,458 --> 00:40:15,583
since there's no protest from their side,
they're planning something big.

617
00:40:15,792 --> 00:40:17,375
Just say yes, brother,
I'll kill them.

618
00:40:17,583 --> 00:40:18,292
Kill them.

619
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:19,208
Brother!

620
00:40:21,333 --> 00:40:23,375
Get the weapons.
- Okay, brother.

621
00:40:39,583 --> 00:40:40,583
Get the vehicle!

622
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:05,958
Brother! Hit him!

623
00:41:06,542 --> 00:41:09,375
He's having weapon,
we must plan and kill him.

624
00:41:09,583 --> 00:41:10,458
Go.

625
00:41:20,083 --> 00:41:21,250
Cut it.

626
00:41:25,167 --> 00:41:25,875
Brother!

627
00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:27,500
One murder or two!

628
00:41:27,708 --> 00:41:29,458
No, I'm shivering in fear, brother.

629
00:41:29,667 --> 00:41:30,458
What are you saying?

630
00:41:30,625 --> 00:41:32,583
He entered our street with
billhook, brother.

631
00:41:32,792 --> 00:41:35,083
None of you boys are in house
to protect me.

632
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:38,417
Brother, he's planning something big,
be alert, brother.

633
00:41:39,667 --> 00:41:41,250
Where's the billhook I kept here?

634
00:41:41,417 --> 00:41:43,417
What's it, brother?
- Where's the billhook?

635
00:41:43,625 --> 00:41:46,792
It's with me for safety to our boys.

636
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,667
Are you asking me to be safe
taking the billhook with you?

637
00:41:52,875 --> 00:41:54,375
Brother!

638
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:59,708
He has entered the home, brother.

639
00:42:30,792 --> 00:42:34,208
You're standing before me bravely
because I don't have any weapon, right?

640
00:42:34,375 --> 00:42:38,000
My boys are waiting outside
with weapons.

641
00:42:38,208 --> 00:42:41,167
Just one phone call,
your head will roll down.

642
00:42:41,333 --> 00:42:44,750
Call...call them, sir.

643
00:42:51,333 --> 00:42:53,083
It's switched off.

644
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:56,375
The guys who chased me,
switching off the phone,

645
00:42:56,583 --> 00:43:00,625
eavesdropping from the door to see
what's happening inside,

646
00:43:00,833 --> 00:43:02,833
he's not a real man.

647
00:43:03,042 --> 00:43:07,500
Though I came running, the man who
is keeping his phone switched on bravely.

648
00:43:07,708 --> 00:43:09,167
He's real brave man.

649
00:43:09,333 --> 00:43:10,208
What do you say now?

650
00:43:10,417 --> 00:43:11,542
My phone is on.

651
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:15,833
I accept you're a brave man.
But what you did was wrong?

652
00:43:16,042 --> 00:43:17,125
I can forgive love also.

653
00:43:17,292 --> 00:43:20,042
But you wanted to unite
my daughter with a Sikh.

654
00:43:20,208 --> 00:43:21,333
I can't forgive it.

655
00:43:21,542 --> 00:43:23,500
I'll kill you for that.

656
00:43:24,083 --> 00:43:25,833
Kill me...kill me, sir.

657
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:30,583
But before that I need to talk to your
daughter Azhagiya Vadivudaya Sundarambal.

658
00:43:30,792 --> 00:43:35,042
I too never called my daughter
by her full name.

659
00:43:35,333 --> 00:43:36,375
I like it.

660
00:43:37,042 --> 00:43:38,542
I like that name so much.

661
00:43:39,292 --> 00:43:43,125
I like you also for naming her with
such beautiful Tamil name.

662
00:43:43,292 --> 00:43:46,458
I didn't want to bring bad name to you,

663
00:43:46,667 --> 00:43:48,875
that's why I stopped my friend
from eloping with her.

664
00:43:49,083 --> 00:43:52,542
If you feel that was my crime,
kill me....kill me, sir.

665
00:43:56,542 --> 00:43:58,375
You don't believe me, right?

666
00:43:58,958 --> 00:44:00,125
Please give me your phone, sir.

667
00:44:13,583 --> 00:44:16,917
I'm Siva here.
- Tell me, buddy.

668
00:44:17,125 --> 00:44:21,042
I've switched on speaker mode.
Tell clearly whatever you want to!

669
00:44:21,208 --> 00:44:24,875
Give the phone to her.
- Wants to talk to your daughter...

670
00:44:28,208 --> 00:44:32,167
If your father keep you under house
arrest separating from your lover,

671
00:44:32,375 --> 00:44:35,542
do you expect me to attack
to save and marry you?

672
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:38,667
If you've any such idea, forget it.

673
00:44:38,875 --> 00:44:41,042
My father has fixed another girl for me.

674
00:44:41,208 --> 00:44:42,625
Very beautiful girl.

675
00:44:42,833 --> 00:44:46,958
The best thing my dad did was
setting up that girl for me.

676
00:44:47,125 --> 00:44:48,292
I mean fixing marriage with her.

677
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:51,000
So, you...
- Yuck! Stop it!

678
00:44:51,167 --> 00:44:52,500
Who the hell are you to say break up?

679
00:44:52,708 --> 00:44:55,417
Right now, this moment,
I'm breaking up with you.

680
00:44:55,625 --> 00:44:57,875
Dark man! You're not Buck but muck.

681
00:44:58,083 --> 00:45:01,333
No relationship between us anymore.

682
00:45:03,625 --> 00:45:07,125
Why are you getting so angry
as daughter of a thief?

683
00:45:07,333 --> 00:45:09,792
You were born in a smuggler's family, right?

684
00:45:14,333 --> 00:45:19,042
Phone is broken,
my daughter too has a break up.

685
00:45:20,167 --> 00:45:24,917
In such situations,
this is the logical end of cell phones.

686
00:45:25,083 --> 00:45:27,792
That's why I called from your phone.

687
00:45:28,375 --> 00:45:30,625
You're dangerously smart.

688
00:45:30,833 --> 00:45:35,167
Everything is done.
No love, no fight, no murder.

689
00:45:35,458 --> 00:45:42,833
You can now fix her marriage with
a Tamil boy and celebrate it grandly, Kasi sir.

690
00:45:43,042 --> 00:45:43,958
Shall I go?

691
00:45:44,125 --> 00:45:45,917
He trapped him with words.

692
00:45:46,458 --> 00:45:49,958
Accountant, his dealing is different.
Who is he?

693
00:45:50,125 --> 00:45:54,000
He's Jayavelu's son, the man
who handed over idol to police.

694
00:45:54,167 --> 00:45:55,167
Is it?

695
00:45:55,375 --> 00:45:56,250
Boy!

696
00:45:57,667 --> 00:45:58,792
Son-in-law!

697
00:45:59,667 --> 00:46:02,333
He's not my son-in-law,
one who insulted by calling me as thief.

698
00:46:02,542 --> 00:46:05,250
You came to wipe out the blemish,
you're my son-in-law.

699
00:46:08,875 --> 00:46:12,458
Son-in-law....please stop, son-in-law.

700
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:16,500
Why your face is dull?

701
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,917
Did Kasi threaten you there?
- No.

702
00:46:21,125 --> 00:46:22,333
Did he abuse you?

703
00:46:23,625 --> 00:46:24,750
Did he thrash you?

704
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:26,708
No problem if he had thrashed me.

705
00:46:26,958 --> 00:46:28,708
Then, why your face is sullen?

706
00:46:29,208 --> 00:46:31,000
He called me son-in-law.

707
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:36,958
He has made me husband
of your girl friend.

708
00:46:43,708 --> 00:46:46,833
That's why I said don't go there.
Did you listen to me?

709
00:46:50,292 --> 00:46:53,208
I shouldn't have gone there.

710
00:46:53,417 --> 00:46:55,667
New problem developed
because I went there.

711
00:46:57,333 --> 00:47:01,000
This is what I said earlier.
- No, I...

712
00:47:22,458 --> 00:47:24,833
Oh no, she's after me!
- Stop I say!

713
00:47:25,542 --> 00:47:26,500
Throw the stick!

714
00:47:26,667 --> 00:47:28,250
Let's discuss and settle issues.
- Stop!

715
00:47:28,458 --> 00:47:30,250
Listen to me...you misunderstood me,
you always do it.

716
00:47:30,458 --> 00:47:31,083
Please listen to me.

717
00:47:31,292 --> 00:47:32,208
My friend told me everything.

718
00:47:32,417 --> 00:47:33,833
Hasty fool, listen to me.

719
00:47:34,042 --> 00:47:36,500
In the name of uniting lovers,
you trapped my friend,

720
00:47:36,667 --> 00:47:39,917
charmed her father to accept you
as his son-in-law, right?

721
00:47:40,125 --> 00:47:41,167
I didn't do anything.

722
00:47:41,375 --> 00:47:42,625
If my father hears this,
you're dead man.

723
00:47:42,833 --> 00:47:44,708
Please listen to me.
- Stop I say.

724
00:47:44,917 --> 00:47:45,833
You'll regret for this.

725
00:47:46,042 --> 00:47:48,958
I'll kill you.
- Whatever I said is true.

726
00:47:49,167 --> 00:47:51,625
Don't run...stop!

727
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:55,583
Trust me,
I did it for friendship only.

728
00:47:55,792 --> 00:47:58,625
Is it friendship to date friend's lover?

729
00:48:00,833 --> 00:48:01,625
Brother!

730
00:48:01,917 --> 00:48:03,542
I think we've reached the area.

731
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:06,125
Yes, brother, I think so.
- I'll call him on phone.

732
00:48:07,583 --> 00:48:11,417
Brother, its Mayan here.
We're in Chennai, brother.

733
00:48:11,583 --> 00:48:14,417
We're coming to your area, bother.
Are you surprized?

734
00:48:14,583 --> 00:48:17,333
Brother, we can find address
with phone number.

735
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:20,375
How long will you search
for Jayavelu alone here?

736
00:48:20,542 --> 00:48:24,417
Just get his phone number,
I'll find his address.

737
00:48:24,583 --> 00:48:27,417
Now that we're here,
don't worry, brother.

738
00:48:27,583 --> 00:48:29,417
We'll be in your area in
another 10 minutes.

739
00:48:29,583 --> 00:48:31,625
Hey Maya...wait...

740
00:48:35,417 --> 00:48:36,250
Jayavelu!

741
00:48:47,792 --> 00:48:50,667
Where's Keerthivasan's house, brother?

742
00:48:51,167 --> 00:48:54,958
His house...go straight...
turn this side...

743
00:48:55,167 --> 00:48:57,750
Wait...wait...
His friend was here just now.

744
00:48:57,958 --> 00:48:59,292
Brother, they're searching for you.

745
00:48:59,458 --> 00:49:00,958
Keep quiet....don't look at me.

746
00:49:01,167 --> 00:49:04,542
Siva, come here.

747
00:49:06,083 --> 00:49:08,125
Don't come here, Siva.

748
00:49:08,333 --> 00:49:11,542
Shall I call him here?
- Keep quiet, man.

749
00:49:11,792 --> 00:49:12,875
What's it, brother?

750
00:49:13,083 --> 00:49:16,708
The man you came for lives
right before his home.

751
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:19,375
Father was here, where's he?
- He was right here only.

752
00:49:19,542 --> 00:49:21,292
I think he would've gone home.
- Gone home?

753
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:24,125
Please guide us to that address...

754
00:49:24,333 --> 00:49:26,542
I'm also going home.
- Let's go in vehicle.

755
00:49:26,917 --> 00:49:30,250
Looks like he'll betray me.

756
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,625
Go straight and turn left, brother.

757
00:49:35,625 --> 00:49:39,833
All of you guys are in whites,
who are you guys?

758
00:49:40,042 --> 00:49:42,708
We're Keerthivasan's cousins.

759
00:49:42,917 --> 00:49:46,917
Who the brother is?
- I don't know who his brother is.

760
00:49:47,125 --> 00:49:48,750
Did you see his mocking?

761
00:49:48,958 --> 00:49:50,167
Yes, brother.

762
00:49:50,375 --> 00:49:53,125
I asked your name.

763
00:50:01,375 --> 00:50:02,167
Where are you, dad?

764
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:04,250
Don't say anything.

765
00:50:06,708 --> 00:50:07,250
He cut the call.

766
00:50:08,417 --> 00:50:11,083
Who is calling on phone?
- Father.

767
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:14,750
What's your father's name?
- Jay...

768
00:50:17,875 --> 00:50:18,542
What's it, dad?

769
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:23,208
Boy, I'm not your father now.
- Dad, you're my father, right?

770
00:50:23,375 --> 00:50:25,500
I'm not your father now.

771
00:50:25,708 --> 00:50:28,250
Are you not Siva's father?
- I'll kill you.

772
00:50:28,417 --> 00:50:30,333
If you're not my father,
who is my father then?

773
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:33,500
They mustn't know I'm your father.

774
00:50:33,875 --> 00:50:35,958
Father...to them...
you're my father, right?

775
00:50:36,167 --> 00:50:36,875
Don't shout.

776
00:50:37,083 --> 00:50:40,292
Those goons around you mustn't
know I'm your father.

777
00:50:40,458 --> 00:50:42,875
Entire town knows that you're my father.

778
00:50:43,083 --> 00:50:44,417
First tell this to your mother.

779
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:47,042
I came to know you're my father
after mother told me.

780
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:50,083
He's confusing me,
please listen to me, son.

781
00:50:50,292 --> 00:50:51,750
Your mother is not your mother anymore.

782
00:50:51,958 --> 00:50:53,250
What are you saying, dad?

783
00:50:53,417 --> 00:50:57,458
Why are you killing me on phone
by saying no mother, no father, dad?

784
00:50:57,667 --> 00:51:00,625
If they know we're your parents,
they'll kill us.

785
00:51:00,833 --> 00:51:02,250
What are you saying, dad?

786
00:51:13,625 --> 00:51:16,292
It's hurting boy's leg, keep it backside.

787
00:51:16,458 --> 00:51:17,458
Okay, brother.

788
00:51:25,333 --> 00:51:26,208
Bye boy, buddy.

789
00:51:26,375 --> 00:51:27,417
Buddy?

790
00:51:27,792 --> 00:51:28,542
Boy?

791
00:51:32,917 --> 00:51:34,625
It's okay if he manages them.

792
00:51:36,792 --> 00:51:38,125
Get down, boys.

793
00:51:59,792 --> 00:52:00,667
Who are you?

794
00:52:00,833 --> 00:52:02,625
Is it brother Keerthi's house...?
- This is his house.

795
00:52:02,792 --> 00:52:04,667
Then, you are...?
- His daughter.

796
00:52:04,833 --> 00:52:06,208
Are you brother's daughter?

797
00:52:06,417 --> 00:52:07,625
Come in, boys.

798
00:52:10,583 --> 00:52:13,208
Come, dear.
Why are you surprized?

799
00:52:13,417 --> 00:52:16,083
Your father is my cousin brother.
We're his cousins.

800
00:52:16,292 --> 00:52:19,958
His father and my father are brothers.
Didn't your father tell you this?

801
00:52:20,167 --> 00:52:20,917
No.

802
00:52:21,542 --> 00:52:24,292
Which place are you from?
- Which place?

803
00:52:25,708 --> 00:52:28,208
Do you know greatness about our clan?

804
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:32,375
What does it mean?
Do you know or not?

805
00:52:32,583 --> 00:52:34,792
No. I don't know.
- Don't know?

806
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,875
Boy, bring it.

807
00:52:39,875 --> 00:52:41,917
Hold it, dear.

808
00:52:42,375 --> 00:52:44,375
This is...this is our clan.

809
00:52:44,792 --> 00:52:48,583
Even little kids would show billhook
if you ask about our family.

810
00:52:48,708 --> 00:52:52,125
Who is the man to call women like that?

811
00:52:57,333 --> 00:52:59,542
Who is that idiot to call woman
with whistle?

812
00:52:59,708 --> 00:53:00,833
It's me.

813
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:03,167
Oh God! Is it you?

814
00:53:03,375 --> 00:53:05,542
Have you lost your sensitiveness,
honour and respect?

815
00:53:05,708 --> 00:53:10,542
Calling your wife on road like this...
Sorry, not you...that's my husband.

816
00:53:10,708 --> 00:53:12,667
You carry on, please.
- Go...go...man.- You carry on.

817
00:53:12,875 --> 00:53:15,792
Why are you insulting me on road...
- Don’t shout, you donkey.

818
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,125
Why are you insulting me on road?

819
00:53:18,333 --> 00:53:20,750
Come this side.
- Coming.

820
00:53:20,958 --> 00:53:22,167
Come this side.

821
00:53:22,375 --> 00:53:23,333
Get inside.

822
00:53:23,542 --> 00:53:25,333
Coming.
- Get in quickly.

823
00:53:25,542 --> 00:53:26,542
Don't make noise.

824
00:53:28,125 --> 00:53:28,958
Come closer.

825
00:53:29,167 --> 00:53:31,292
Not here please, you're too bad.

826
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:32,875
Hey you devil!

827
00:53:33,083 --> 00:53:35,292
Killers are here.
- Who is he?

828
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:36,542
They're nothing compared to you.

829
00:53:36,708 --> 00:53:38,708
Just brush like this,
they'll fly away like cotton.

830
00:53:38,917 --> 00:53:40,083
Come, don't get scared.

831
00:53:40,292 --> 00:53:42,417
Keerthivasan's cousins are here
to kill us.

832
00:53:42,583 --> 00:53:44,208
Oh God, I'm not here.

833
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:48,792
Our place isn't like other places
to wake up with rooster's crows.

834
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,083
Because there's no poultry in village.

835
00:53:52,708 --> 00:53:54,792
That's God's order.

836
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:58,083
Not only that, the village is
divided into two.

837
00:53:58,292 --> 00:53:59,292
We've put a fence also.

838
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:02,625
This side is Thekkathipuram
and that side is Vadakathipuram.

839
00:54:02,833 --> 00:54:05,292
We've been living with violence
since generations.

840
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:09,667
23 years ago, a scapegoat known
as Jayavelu escaped to this place.

841
00:54:09,875 --> 00:54:12,625
We're here to take his head.

842
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:15,167
You must cut his head.

843
00:54:15,375 --> 00:54:17,250
What do you say, boys?
- You're right, brother.

844
00:54:17,667 --> 00:54:18,750
Will you cut his head?

845
00:54:20,042 --> 00:54:20,500
Will you cut?

846
00:54:20,667 --> 00:54:22,083
Who is it?

847
00:54:24,042 --> 00:54:26,500
Sister-in-law.
It's me Mayan.

848
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:29,958
Abhi, go inside.

849
00:54:34,458 --> 00:54:38,458
Instead of calling guests inside,
why are you scolding daughter, sister-in-law?

850
00:54:38,625 --> 00:54:39,833
Why did you come here?

851
00:54:40,042 --> 00:54:42,292
Instead of calling when did you come,
are you asking why are we here?

852
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:44,250
Did we come all the way to hear this?

853
00:54:44,458 --> 00:54:45,500
What will you do here?

854
00:54:45,667 --> 00:54:48,042
I'll send your brother to village,
settle issues there only.

855
00:54:48,250 --> 00:54:49,792
No, sister-in-law, we are...

856
00:54:50,083 --> 00:54:51,750
Go away. Go.

857
00:54:51,917 --> 00:54:55,250
We'll find Jayavelu someday.

858
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:58,250
When we find him,
we'll kill him before grandma.

859
00:54:58,625 --> 00:55:02,833
Grandma will not die without seeing it.
She'll hold on to see it.

860
00:55:03,583 --> 00:55:04,500
Come on, boys.

861
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,583
Pick it up.

862
00:55:20,625 --> 00:55:24,833
Sister-in-law, Jayavelu has a son of
your daughter's age, right?

863
00:55:25,042 --> 00:55:26,458
I'll kill him also.

864
00:55:40,083 --> 00:55:42,833
Why father's cousins are
after uncle's life, mother?

865
00:55:43,083 --> 00:55:44,750
Better ask your father.

866
00:55:44,958 --> 00:55:46,083
Father's phone is switched off.

867
00:55:46,292 --> 00:55:48,792
Uncle...uncle...
- Son....son...son...- Wait Siva.

868
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,167
Welcome hooligan!

869
00:55:50,375 --> 00:55:53,458
I saw your machismo.
Coward...coward.

870
00:55:53,667 --> 00:55:56,125
Are you making fun of my son?

871
00:55:56,333 --> 00:55:59,125
He came with a large billhook
to kill uncle.

872
00:55:59,333 --> 00:56:02,583
He's hiding inside home.
Is this the way you raised him?

873
00:56:02,792 --> 00:56:04,458
Mind your words.

874
00:56:04,625 --> 00:56:07,167
You don't know the truth
why my son is like this?

875
00:56:07,375 --> 00:56:08,000
Mother.

876
00:56:08,208 --> 00:56:11,958
No son...if I hide truth anymore,
she may consider you as coward.

877
00:56:12,167 --> 00:56:13,000
Wait.

878
00:56:13,333 --> 00:56:16,500
He was 3 years old then.
Just joined LKG class.

879
00:56:16,708 --> 00:56:19,125
One day he was sharpening pencil
with blade.

880
00:56:19,333 --> 00:56:23,500
Fearing he may hurt his finger with blade,
I caught his hand in anxiety.

881
00:56:23,708 --> 00:56:24,708
He cut his finger.

882
00:56:24,917 --> 00:56:26,625
I was aghast seeing him bleed.

883
00:56:26,833 --> 00:56:30,000
But my son wiped it casually
saying not a big deal.

884
00:56:30,208 --> 00:56:34,333
Seeing the genes of our clan in him,
taking him into my lap,

885
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:41,083
I took a promise from him not to shed
a drop blood and never fight anyone.

886
00:56:41,292 --> 00:56:45,708
He's still living like a peaceful dove
for the promise he made me at age 3.

887
00:56:45,917 --> 00:56:49,333
Have you heard about peaceful
peacock, peaceful cuckoo?

888
00:57:08,292 --> 00:57:13,292
I called you mad...

889
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:18,500
I wantonly troubled you...

890
00:57:20,875 --> 00:57:25,958
I always thought you're mine...

891
00:57:27,125 --> 00:57:32,083
I always fought with you, rogue...

892
00:57:33,208 --> 00:57:44,625
Whenever you come before me,
instantly I start a fight...

893
00:57:45,833 --> 00:57:56,875
Whenever you cross my threshold,
I'll spill water on you...

894
00:57:58,708 --> 00:58:03,542
Why did I change now?

895
00:58:04,958 --> 00:58:09,333
Why am I turning new leaf?

896
00:58:11,333 --> 00:58:17,583
I'm moving towards you like
waves hitting shore...

897
00:58:58,208 --> 00:59:04,208
Why my heart is skipping
a beat for you?

898
00:59:04,333 --> 00:59:11,042
I'm no more myself,
I'm new to myself...

899
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:17,292
We were always at loggerheads
with each other...

900
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:23,625
I always turned heat on you...

901
00:59:36,375 --> 00:59:43,125
Everything changed in one day...
I've become part of you...

902
01:00:01,333 --> 01:00:07,250
When I think about you,
I'm laughing...

903
01:00:07,458 --> 01:00:14,167
I can realize you are growing on me...

904
01:00:14,333 --> 01:00:20,333
I was clear in life till yesterday...

905
01:00:20,542 --> 01:00:27,875
Today, I slowly changed...

906
01:00:39,542 --> 01:00:46,167
I'm struggling like
I'm getting choked...

907
01:00:56,208 --> 01:01:00,208
You would've heard about
peaceful dove not about....

908
01:01:03,250 --> 01:01:04,917
Is dove important now?
Come here.

909
01:01:05,125 --> 01:01:06,167
No, hubby...

910
01:01:06,375 --> 01:01:09,292
Dove...prawn...
what's this nonsense?

911
01:01:09,542 --> 01:01:10,875
He has started lamenting.

912
01:01:11,083 --> 01:01:13,708
After knowing wife has hidden truth,
he has started lamenting.

913
01:01:13,917 --> 01:01:15,125
Please forgive me...forgive me.

914
01:01:15,333 --> 01:01:17,083
Mother!
- What's it, son?

915
01:01:17,292 --> 01:01:18,333
I must know the truth.

916
01:01:18,542 --> 01:01:21,250
Your mother told you everything, right?
- Not that, dad.

917
01:01:21,458 --> 01:01:24,000
Why Keerthi uncle's cousins
are after your life?

918
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,583
Are you going to tell me or not?
- I'll tell you, son.

919
01:01:27,833 --> 01:01:31,542
Our family and Keerthi uncle's family
belong to the same village.

920
01:01:31,708 --> 01:01:35,125
Since generations we've been
killing each other.

921
01:01:42,667 --> 01:01:45,917
Now, my cousins want me
to kill Keerthivasan.

922
01:01:46,125 --> 01:01:47,708
We can't.

923
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,875
We grew up together from
very young age as friends.

924
01:01:52,083 --> 01:01:57,625
Giving up that village and enmity,
we settled down in city after our marriage.

925
01:01:57,958 --> 01:02:00,250
This is uncle's house
and that is our house.

926
01:02:00,542 --> 01:02:02,833
He's going that side, catch him.

927
01:02:03,083 --> 01:02:03,792
Kill him first!

928
01:02:05,625 --> 01:02:10,833
He may escape....
don't spare him...

929
01:02:11,042 --> 01:02:12,250
Don't go that side.
Don't go that side.

930
01:02:12,458 --> 01:02:15,125
Come this side...
- Go that side...

931
01:02:39,375 --> 01:02:42,000
If you run so fast,
how can I catch you, brother-in-law?

932
01:02:42,208 --> 01:02:42,792
I'm breathless.

933
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,250
I thought you'd kill me seeing you
with a billhook, brother-in-law.

934
01:02:45,458 --> 01:02:46,042
I'll not kill you.

935
01:02:46,250 --> 01:02:50,083
They would think we would've killed
each other, brother-in-law.

936
01:02:50,292 --> 01:02:51,583
We must leave this place immediately.

937
01:02:51,792 --> 01:02:54,458
Come...come...
- Hubby...

938
01:02:54,625 --> 01:02:56,792
Throw it down...

939
01:02:57,417 --> 01:02:59,625
Why should we be enemies?

940
01:02:59,833 --> 01:03:01,667
Let this village think so.

941
01:03:01,875 --> 01:03:05,833
Let's not be enemies.
Let's live together.

942
01:03:06,042 --> 01:03:08,417
As far as village is concerned,

943
01:03:08,583 --> 01:03:10,792
I've gone underground,
you're searching for me in Chennai,

944
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,542
and I'm searching you,
who has gone underground. That's it.

945
01:03:12,750 --> 01:03:16,375
Sister-in-law, our only ambition is
to raise our children.

946
01:03:16,542 --> 01:03:17,375
Yes, sister-in-law.

947
01:03:17,542 --> 01:03:20,417
If enmity between our families
has to end with this generation,

948
01:03:20,583 --> 01:03:24,250
my son Siva must marry
your daughter Abhirami.

949
01:03:24,458 --> 01:03:27,250
Our only aim is to see them
live happily, brother-in-law.

950
01:03:27,458 --> 01:03:31,083
To see at least your generation
live happily,

951
01:03:31,292 --> 01:03:34,833
we left the village
when you were just infants.

952
01:03:35,375 --> 01:03:39,583
To put an end to family feud
running for 5 generations,

953
01:03:39,792 --> 01:03:43,750
if you and Abhi marry,
I feel our families will bow for it.

954
01:03:43,958 --> 01:03:46,875
But you both are like Tom and Jerry.

955
01:03:47,083 --> 01:03:48,625
Forget about that.

956
01:03:48,833 --> 01:03:51,375
Tell me the reason for running feud
between your families.

957
01:03:51,542 --> 01:03:54,125
I told you, right? Your great grandfather
and Abhi's great grandfather...

958
01:03:54,333 --> 01:03:55,083
Dad!
- What?

959
01:03:55,292 --> 01:03:59,542
Tell me the exact reason for this
killing spree for 5 generations.

960
01:04:06,208 --> 01:04:06,958
Don't know.

961
01:04:07,125 --> 01:04:10,458
You tell the history of a statue
on just seeing it.

962
01:04:10,667 --> 01:04:14,542
But for 5 generations you've been killing
each other without knowing the reason.

963
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:18,000
First find the reason for this enmity, dad.

964
01:04:19,917 --> 01:04:23,500
I got a phone call....
I'll come back in a moment...

965
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:27,708
What's it, Parama?

966
01:04:27,917 --> 01:04:31,042
Brother, we found the scapegoat.

967
01:04:31,250 --> 01:04:32,917
Tell me clearly.

968
01:04:33,125 --> 01:04:37,583
We found Keerthivasan,
who hid for 23 years from you.

969
01:04:38,042 --> 01:04:41,250
Don't do anything.

970
01:04:41,417 --> 01:04:43,083
My nail too won't hurt him, brother.

971
01:04:43,292 --> 01:04:46,708
Kill him with your own hands.
You come to village immediately, brother.

972
01:04:48,417 --> 01:04:51,208
How did you get caught
with them, brother-in-law?

973
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:53,375
What am I to tell them now?

974
01:04:54,708 --> 01:04:56,500
Who called on the phone?

975
01:04:56,708 --> 01:04:58,417
Keerthivasan.
It seems he has been kidnapped.

976
01:04:58,625 --> 01:05:00,000
What are you saying, dad?
- Kidnapped?

977
01:05:00,208 --> 01:05:03,125
I asked him what the reason
for enmity was,

978
01:05:03,333 --> 01:05:05,292
he asked me to come to village,
I was thinking of going there.

979
01:05:05,458 --> 01:05:07,417
Where's brother?
- They took him in vehicle.

980
01:05:07,625 --> 01:05:08,333
Took him in vehicle.

981
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:12,208
He took bus...
he told me to follow him.

982
01:05:12,375 --> 01:05:13,333
I'm going.

983
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:15,042
Brother.
- Yes?

984
01:05:15,250 --> 01:05:16,875
Any problem?

985
01:05:17,083 --> 01:05:18,667
Would I leave if there is?

986
01:05:18,833 --> 01:05:21,042
I'll find the reason and
put an end to it.

987
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:22,000
Bye.

988
01:05:22,208 --> 01:05:23,083
Uncle!

989
01:05:23,417 --> 01:05:25,625
I called father,
his phone is switched off.

990
01:05:25,833 --> 01:05:28,083
That's why he called me.

991
01:05:39,333 --> 01:05:40,167
Grandma!

992
01:05:42,667 --> 01:05:45,250
My brother must come here.

993
01:05:45,417 --> 01:05:50,333
If you hurt my grandma,
I'll kill your brother.

994
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:51,667
Send my brother this side.

995
01:05:51,875 --> 01:05:53,958
First you send her.

996
01:05:57,917 --> 01:05:58,750
Grandma!

997
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:04,167
Brother!

998
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:29,292
Parama, we must kill him.
Call my grandson Jayavelu.

999
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:36,917
God, it's been years since I stepped
into native village.

1000
01:06:37,125 --> 01:06:38,792
Protect people here!

1001
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:41,917
Brother!

1002
01:06:48,083 --> 01:06:49,500
Have you come back?

1003
01:11:22,083 --> 01:11:27,875
Kill him...kill him...kill him...

1004
01:11:28,083 --> 01:11:29,542
Shall I kill you, brother-in-law?

1005
01:11:29,708 --> 01:11:32,958
Brother-in-law, I'll kill everyone
in this village.

1006
01:11:33,167 --> 01:11:34,542
Lion, show your prowess.

1007
01:11:34,750 --> 01:11:36,458
Brother, we're asking you to kill,
why are you watching fun?

1008
01:11:36,625 --> 01:11:37,833
Go...go...

1009
01:11:44,542 --> 01:11:46,542
Why should we kill each other?

1010
01:11:46,750 --> 01:11:48,500
Tell me.
- Tell me.

1011
01:11:48,667 --> 01:11:49,708
Come on, tell me I say!

1012
01:11:49,917 --> 01:11:52,500
His father killed your father,
that's why.

1013
01:11:52,667 --> 01:11:57,083
Grandma, yesterday it was my father,
now we!

1014
01:11:57,292 --> 01:11:59,167
Would our children die tomorrow?

1015
01:11:59,375 --> 01:12:02,667
Tell me the reason for this family feud
since many generations.

1016
01:12:02,875 --> 01:12:03,667
Then, we'll kill each other.

1017
01:12:03,875 --> 01:12:05,583
Nobody asked this question earlier.

1018
01:12:05,792 --> 01:12:08,375
Grandma, tell me.
Don't you know the answer?

1019
01:12:10,625 --> 01:12:12,458
You're talking so much,
don't you also know the reason?

1020
01:12:12,625 --> 01:12:13,708
Don't you know it?

1021
01:12:13,917 --> 01:12:15,167
Hey village elders!

1022
01:12:15,375 --> 01:12:17,792
Tell us the reason for enmity,
we'll kill each other.

1023
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,333
Tell us.

1024
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:26,333
What I am trying to say is...
- Stop it, priest!

1025
01:12:27,125 --> 01:12:32,500
Tell us the reason for family feud since
many generations, we'll kill each other.

1026
01:12:32,833 --> 01:12:35,292
If anyone dares to come forward
without telling us the reason,

1027
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:37,333
we'll kill you.
- be careful.

1028
01:12:38,208 --> 01:12:40,500
Brother-in-law!
- Brother-in-law!

1029
01:12:41,542 --> 01:12:44,458
Move...move...they may kill us.

1030
01:12:56,333 --> 01:12:59,000
Grandma, I'm thirsty,
give me some water.

1031
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:01,667
I shouldn't offer you water.
- Why grandma?

1032
01:13:01,875 --> 01:13:03,875
I've been banished from village.

1033
01:13:04,083 --> 01:13:06,375
Why did they banish you, grandma?

1034
01:13:06,542 --> 01:13:10,583
I raised chicken without village council's
knowledge 40 years ago.

1035
01:13:10,875 --> 01:13:14,750
They found it and
banished me from village.

1036
01:13:14,958 --> 01:13:17,417
Our village people, right?
They'll do such things.

1037
01:13:17,583 --> 01:13:21,542
You're here with billhook,
are you going to sharpen it?

1038
01:13:23,542 --> 01:13:26,542
It wasn't fault to banish this old lady.

1039
01:13:27,333 --> 01:13:29,208
Look at the old lady's wry fun.

1040
01:13:29,542 --> 01:13:32,250
We're struggling to know the
reason for generations of enmity.

1041
01:13:32,458 --> 01:13:35,458
Now I know, you're from
Therkathipuram, right?

1042
01:13:36,417 --> 01:13:38,042
Did you ask knowing about us?

1043
01:13:38,250 --> 01:13:45,542
Do you know the reason
for 5 generations of enmity?

1044
01:13:47,417 --> 01:13:51,417
Tell us, why?

1045
01:13:51,625 --> 01:13:54,375
Do you know or not?
- I know.

1046
01:13:55,333 --> 01:13:56,917
You know, right? Then, tell us.

1047
01:13:57,125 --> 01:13:59,917
This story was told to my grandpa
by his grandpa.

1048
01:14:00,125 --> 01:14:03,750
My grandpa told me that story.

1049
01:14:14,542 --> 01:14:16,542
Who kept this egg in village council?

1050
01:14:16,750 --> 01:14:19,333
Leader! The council was called
for that egg only.

1051
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:22,708
What are you saying?
- Sir, this is problem between brothers-in-law.

1052
01:14:22,917 --> 01:14:27,083
What's the problem between you?
- What else? Problem of heir.

1053
01:14:27,292 --> 01:14:28,375
Heir?
- Yes.

1054
01:14:28,583 --> 01:14:32,500
Rasakannu which belongs to my clan,
Sellai that belongs to my brother-in-law's clan,

1055
01:14:32,708 --> 01:14:34,917
this egg is the result of their union.

1056
01:14:35,125 --> 01:14:39,917
I don't mind losing my life but the first egg
must come to my home, leader.

1057
01:14:40,125 --> 01:14:43,000
Bloody! Did you call council meet
for just an egg?

1058
01:14:43,208 --> 01:14:46,208
Why, Ponnaiah?

1059
01:14:46,375 --> 01:14:52,917
This is the first heir after union of
my Rasakannu and my brother-in-law's Sellai.

1060
01:14:53,125 --> 01:14:54,875
By natural justice,
the egg belongs to us, right?

1061
01:14:55,083 --> 01:14:57,500
How is it possible?
The egg was laid by my Sellai.

1062
01:14:57,708 --> 01:14:58,667
It belongs to us.

1063
01:14:58,875 --> 01:14:59,917
First heir.

1064
01:15:00,125 --> 01:15:04,917
Hey Gangamma! My Rasakannu is lion!

1065
01:15:05,125 --> 01:15:08,667
How your hen can lay eggs
without Rasakannu.

1066
01:15:08,875 --> 01:15:12,292
Leader, we must get the first egg.
It's a matter of family honour.

1067
01:15:12,458 --> 01:15:15,750
Has this woman lost her balance?

1068
01:15:15,958 --> 01:15:20,458
Let them take today's egg,
let them take tomorrow's egg.

1069
01:15:20,667 --> 01:15:22,292
This is my judgement for both families.

1070
01:15:22,458 --> 01:15:23,917
Council meet is over.
I'm leaving.

1071
01:15:24,125 --> 01:15:27,167
Leader! The egg must come to us.

1072
01:15:27,542 --> 01:15:29,167
No way, leader.

1073
01:15:29,333 --> 01:15:32,458
First egg by our dear Sellai
belongs to us.

1074
01:15:32,875 --> 01:15:35,875
If I not I don't mind this
is council meet.

1075
01:15:36,083 --> 01:15:40,292
I'll kill everyone here.

1076
01:15:40,458 --> 01:15:42,625
Look at the face
that's threatening to kill.

1077
01:15:42,833 --> 01:15:44,708
Leader! Is this council meeting?

1078
01:15:44,917 --> 01:15:46,458
You've allowed a woman to speak
in public!

1079
01:15:46,667 --> 01:15:49,917
How dare you say that!
I'll kill you.

1080
01:15:50,125 --> 01:15:51,125
Kill him!

1081
01:15:51,292 --> 01:15:52,125
Stop it.

1082
01:15:52,292 --> 01:15:53,708
Why two families are fighting
with each other?

1083
01:15:54,417 --> 01:15:58,125
Useless buggers!
Fighting for no reason.

1084
01:15:58,375 --> 01:16:02,083
Egg is not the only reason
for this problem.

1085
01:16:02,292 --> 01:16:04,917
Rasakannu and Sellai are
responsible for this.

1086
01:16:05,125 --> 01:16:06,250
Catch it and kill it.

1087
01:16:06,417 --> 01:16:08,667
Oh they're going to kill it.

1088
01:16:13,208 --> 01:16:23,792
There's goes Rasakannu,
with whom played...

1089
01:16:24,250 --> 01:16:34,458
There's goes the playful
and swift Sellai dear...

1090
01:16:34,958 --> 01:16:39,958
Come to us crawling like a child...

1091
01:16:40,167 --> 01:16:45,375
Let's go around the world...

1092
01:16:45,583 --> 01:16:56,208
Let's fly into sky and sow clouds
in the streets of Therkathi village...

1093
01:17:17,333 --> 01:17:22,333
Don't know why....
Don't know why it is so...

1094
01:17:22,542 --> 01:17:27,583
Why to run hiding without
committing any mistake?

1095
01:17:27,917 --> 01:17:37,875
One day the world will realize it...
We'll come back to live...

1096
01:17:38,083 --> 01:17:43,167
You're flying away from us...

1097
01:17:43,333 --> 01:17:49,125
Isn't it sorrowful?

1098
01:17:49,292 --> 01:18:00,167
Carrying niece close to heart,
isn't it bliss to run South...

1099
01:18:21,292 --> 01:18:31,125
You’re swift and smart...
Stand before me...

1100
01:18:31,875 --> 01:18:41,417
You join together to torture me...

1101
01:18:43,125 --> 01:18:47,667
When you see us with egg
like eyes from distance...

1102
01:18:47,875 --> 01:18:52,708
Will shake head with crown...

1103
01:19:30,625 --> 01:19:34,167
Don't kill each other, please...

1104
01:19:36,583 --> 01:19:37,833
They killed him!

1105
01:19:38,042 --> 01:19:39,750
We mustn't rest without taking revenge.

1106
01:19:39,958 --> 01:19:41,208
Kill him.

1107
01:19:41,417 --> 01:19:46,375
Those chicken and egg are
the reason for these deaths.

1108
01:19:46,583 --> 01:19:52,000
I'm banishing chicken and eggs
from this village.

1109
01:19:52,167 --> 01:19:54,667
This Samikannu's order

1110
01:19:54,875 --> 01:19:57,250
Sir...sir...what happened, sir?

1111
01:19:57,458 --> 01:20:02,417
Families of brothers-in-law
killed each other.

1112
01:20:02,625 --> 01:20:08,750
With this fight the village
got divided into two.

1113
01:20:09,417 --> 01:20:12,625
For a hen...
- For an egg...

1114
01:20:12,833 --> 01:20:14,333
Are we killing each other
for 5 generations?

1115
01:20:14,542 --> 01:20:16,667
It's in our hands now to put
an end to this, brother-in-law.

1116
01:20:16,875 --> 01:20:19,708
You knew this story,
why didn't you tell this earlier?

1117
01:20:19,917 --> 01:20:22,208
Village would've united without
killing each other, right?

1118
01:20:22,417 --> 01:20:24,125
They banished me from village, right?

1119
01:20:24,333 --> 01:20:26,792
I didn't tell truth because
I wanted the village to get ruined.

1120
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,208
Bloody thirsty old lady!

1121
01:20:28,417 --> 01:20:31,708
If you don't tell this truth to village,
we'll kill you.

1122
01:20:31,917 --> 01:20:35,792
Don't kill me, this is an age to live,
I'll tell the truth to village.

1123
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,958
You're coming to village and
tell them the real reason for enmity.

1124
01:20:38,125 --> 01:20:39,625
We'll put an end to this
problem once for all.

1125
01:20:39,833 --> 01:20:42,083
No more this village is divided into two.

1126
01:20:42,292 --> 01:20:44,917
Is this the story?
- Both villages have united as one.

1127
01:20:45,083 --> 01:20:48,250
No more enmity between us.
We'll share only happiness.

1128
01:20:48,500 --> 01:20:50,208
Is that all the story?

1129
01:20:54,667 --> 01:20:59,083
They came and put an end to
generations of enmity, remove the fence.

1130
01:21:00,042 --> 01:21:01,833
It's no more Therkathipuram
and Vadakathipuram.

1131
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,583
It is Sivalingapuram.

1132
01:21:09,583 --> 01:21:13,167
Eggs are back!

1133
01:21:13,375 --> 01:21:16,458
This village may accept this,
relatives may accept this.

1134
01:21:16,667 --> 01:21:19,750
My heart which is seeking revenge
will not accept this.

1135
01:21:19,958 --> 01:21:22,917
I shall have my vengeance
for killing my husband.

1136
01:21:23,083 --> 01:21:25,000
We must avenge.

1137
01:21:25,208 --> 01:21:28,583
Can't change traditions overnight.

1138
01:21:28,792 --> 01:21:31,458
Blood and billhooks are our clan's identity.

1139
01:21:31,667 --> 01:21:35,167
Boys, you be reasonable and kill them.

1140
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:44,875
Brother-in-law! It's grand welcome!

1141
01:21:45,042 --> 01:21:46,375
Nothing brother-in-law.

1142
01:21:46,583 --> 01:21:48,875
We settled a problem that was
running for generations, right?

1143
01:21:49,042 --> 01:21:49,917
This grand welcome is for that achievement.

1144
01:21:50,083 --> 01:21:52,458
Yes...yes...

1145
01:21:53,292 --> 01:21:54,958
What great love!

1146
01:21:55,167 --> 01:21:56,375
Brother-in-law, a garland for you.

1147
01:21:56,542 --> 01:21:59,917
You settled the issue.
- I came there for you, right?

1148
01:22:00,083 --> 01:22:04,875
In this happy mood, we're fixing
engagement of my son with your daughter.

1149
01:22:05,042 --> 01:22:08,750
That's great news!
- We're doing it.

1150
01:22:13,250 --> 01:22:18,250
You arranged all this, right?

1151
01:22:19,417 --> 01:22:21,667
We can fix Abhi's engagement, right?

1152
01:22:21,875 --> 01:22:23,333
Stop it.
Come inside.

1153
01:22:23,542 --> 01:22:25,208
Brother-in-law.
- You go, brother-in-law.

1154
01:22:25,417 --> 01:22:27,833
Shall we do a tango?

1155
01:22:28,042 --> 01:22:29,500
Why not?

1156
01:22:32,042 --> 01:22:33,333
Why not dance?

1157
01:22:37,250 --> 01:22:38,458
Why is he coming here?

1158
01:22:38,667 --> 01:22:40,875
I was about to tell you
but you started the dance.

1159
01:22:41,083 --> 01:22:42,583
He's a smuggler, I'll finish him.

1160
01:22:42,792 --> 01:22:44,000
Wait.

1161
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:51,167
How's my arrangement, Kinsman?
I bow to you in honour, kinsman?

1162
01:22:51,375 --> 01:22:53,583
Who is your kinsman?
- Hubby...one minute,.

1163
01:22:53,792 --> 01:22:55,083
Go inside. Go.

1164
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:57,792
Why are you creating trouble
in happy mood of marriage?

1165
01:22:57,958 --> 01:23:00,500
Who are we?
We belong to the same place.

1166
01:23:00,708 --> 01:23:03,583
We belong to the same caste.
We have same feelings.

1167
01:23:03,792 --> 01:23:07,167
Are you telling me that?
Clear off lock, stock and barrel.

1168
01:23:07,375 --> 01:23:09,625
You mustn't say like that, kinsman.

1169
01:23:09,833 --> 01:23:10,583
I came searching in
the place I lost it.

1170
01:23:10,792 --> 01:23:14,375
You're talking about idol, right?
It's in police station, get it from them.

1171
01:23:14,583 --> 01:23:17,375
Wrong...I can get it anytime I want.

1172
01:23:17,542 --> 01:23:19,792
What I lost is my daughter
and my honour!

1173
01:23:19,958 --> 01:23:24,667
Your son was responsible for losing
and now it is safe in home because of him.

1174
01:23:24,833 --> 01:23:29,208
I can never find a better son-in-law
than your son, kinsman.

1175
01:23:29,417 --> 01:23:32,125
What are you saying?
Siva is our son-in-law.

1176
01:23:32,333 --> 01:23:33,625
Who the hell he is to change it?

1177
01:23:33,833 --> 01:23:35,792
I'm unable to get him,
please try it, dear.

1178
01:23:35,958 --> 01:23:38,542
You mustn't say like that, kinsman.

1179
01:23:38,750 --> 01:23:40,792
Who is groom to whose daughter?

1180
01:23:40,958 --> 01:23:42,542
Why are you talking to him?

1181
01:23:42,750 --> 01:23:46,750
We've raised our children telling them
they would become man and wife.

1182
01:23:46,958 --> 01:23:47,917
Are you trying to split them?

1183
01:23:48,125 --> 01:23:50,542
You...
- How dare you!

1184
01:23:50,750 --> 01:23:53,542
Who is he?

1185
01:23:53,750 --> 01:23:55,167
Forgive me, kinsman.

1186
01:23:55,375 --> 01:23:56,500
How dare you raise hand on him!

1187
01:23:56,708 --> 01:23:59,958
They're from groom's side.
We can't do anything instantly.

1188
01:24:00,167 --> 01:24:02,333
Who are we? We're bride's family.

1189
01:24:02,542 --> 01:24:05,083
Whether they scold or hit,
we've to take it.

1190
01:24:05,292 --> 01:24:08,083
Because this is the home where
my daughter will spend rest of her life.

1191
01:24:08,292 --> 01:24:09,792
Why should your daughter live her?

1192
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,583
Your son is here, right kinsman?

1193
01:24:12,792 --> 01:24:15,875
If you call him kinsman....
- Brother-in-law....wait.

1194
01:24:16,083 --> 01:24:21,292
We're all close and same,
all of us are pride Tamils.

1195
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:22,333
He has started it.

1196
01:24:22,542 --> 01:24:25,500
Go away.

1197
01:24:25,708 --> 01:24:27,208
Siva hates this.

1198
01:24:27,417 --> 01:24:30,375
If he comes, he'll throw all of you out.

1199
01:24:30,583 --> 01:24:34,167
Let him come...
let him say with his own mouth.

1200
01:24:34,375 --> 01:24:35,083
I'll go away.

1201
01:24:35,292 --> 01:24:37,292
He'll come...he'll ask you to go.

1202
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:38,875
Let him come.

1203
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,542
Did you see there?

1204
01:24:41,750 --> 01:24:43,458
That smuggler is here to fix
his daughter's marriage with you.

1205
01:24:43,667 --> 01:24:45,875
Come...come...get down.

1206
01:24:46,375 --> 01:24:50,083
Tell them, you're not interested in this.

1207
01:24:50,750 --> 01:24:55,167
If you see a good boy in any home,
you come seeking him as son-in-law.

1208
01:24:55,375 --> 01:24:57,375
Our son will marry the girl we select.

1209
01:24:57,583 --> 01:24:59,875
We raised him like that.
Isn't it, son?

1210
01:25:00,083 --> 01:25:03,750
Tell him son, blacken his face
saying his daughter...

1211
01:25:03,958 --> 01:25:04,958
...I like her!

1212
01:25:06,250 --> 01:25:07,875
Son-in-law!
- What are you saying?

1213
01:25:08,083 --> 01:25:09,250
Why did Siva say like that?

1214
01:25:09,458 --> 01:25:12,583
That's his daughter, son?

1215
01:25:14,042 --> 01:25:16,333
I'll marry Kasi uncle's daughter.

1216
01:25:16,542 --> 01:25:18,125
Say like that!

1217
01:25:20,250 --> 01:25:21,833
Why did he say like that?

1218
01:25:28,833 --> 01:25:29,708
Go away!

1219
01:25:33,083 --> 01:25:36,417
I'll marry before you marry.
How dare you avoid me!

1220
01:25:36,625 --> 01:25:38,833
Leave it, mom.
- Leave it.

1221
01:25:39,042 --> 01:25:40,458
What happened, Bhanumanthi?

1222
01:25:40,667 --> 01:25:41,708
Look, what she has done!

1223
01:25:41,875 --> 01:25:43,250
Why are you behaving like this?

1224
01:25:43,458 --> 01:25:47,833
If Siva refuses, so what?
I'll find a better man for you.

1225
01:25:48,042 --> 01:25:49,708
Look, dear...
- Do it first, dad.

1226
01:25:49,917 --> 01:25:55,417
You'll marry in the same marriage hall
at the same time Siva's marriage is fixed.

1227
01:25:55,625 --> 01:25:58,083
One second earlier!
Is it enough?

1228
01:26:01,208 --> 01:26:02,333
Why?

1229
01:26:05,375 --> 01:26:10,917
After ending generations of feud,
I wanted to celebrate son's marriage happily.

1230
01:26:12,583 --> 01:26:14,417
He put a spoke into the wheel of fun.

1231
01:26:14,792 --> 01:26:18,417
Don't worry, our son...

1232
01:26:25,792 --> 01:26:26,500
Father!

1233
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,875
How dare you stop dad
holding his hand!

1234
01:26:30,167 --> 01:26:32,917
He's grown up!
Why are you scolding him?

1235
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:35,375
Father, I...

1236
01:26:35,958 --> 01:26:38,750
Parents love children for
their selfish ends.

1237
01:26:39,417 --> 01:26:41,875
We can't expect in return.

1238
01:26:42,167 --> 01:26:44,750
If he has to understand,
he must be in our shoes.

1239
01:26:44,958 --> 01:26:45,667
Father!

1240
01:26:45,875 --> 01:26:50,042
Struggle against it for so many years.
You finished it in a moment.

1241
01:26:51,500 --> 01:26:53,250
I lost, Rajalakshmi.

1242
01:26:54,125 --> 01:26:57,542
Father...father...

1243
01:26:59,458 --> 01:27:01,125
What did I do to avoid me like this?

1244
01:27:01,333 --> 01:27:04,000
If his friend is important to him,
my friend is important to me.

1245
01:27:04,583 --> 01:27:06,375
What bloody friend!

1246
01:27:06,750 --> 01:27:12,250
He stood bravely against
bloodshed in his village.

1247
01:27:12,458 --> 01:27:16,292
You insulted him in public
by joining hands with smugglers.

1248
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:24,625
He always said no to violence but you said
you like a thief and killer's daughter.

1249
01:27:24,833 --> 01:27:27,625
You must marry and
live happily with her.

1250
01:27:27,833 --> 01:27:31,417
Mother!
- Everything is humbug.

1251
01:27:35,083 --> 01:27:38,000
Don't hit him...please....leave him.

1252
01:27:39,542 --> 01:27:42,417
Please don't harm him.
Don't hit him.

1253
01:27:44,917 --> 01:27:46,167
Don't him, please.

1254
01:27:51,583 --> 01:27:52,792
Please don't hit her.

1255
01:27:55,333 --> 01:27:57,292
What's the complaint?
- Dowry harassment.

1256
01:28:04,417 --> 01:28:07,417
You created problem within
one month of marriage.

1257
01:28:08,500 --> 01:28:12,250
This is normal matrimonial to fix
marriage by matching horoscopes.

1258
01:28:13,167 --> 01:28:14,667
Deal matrimonial.

couple face any problem between them,

1262
01:28:26,458 --> 01:28:30,500
it's the duty of company to solve it.

1263
01:28:30,667 --> 01:28:34,625
My son works in foreign,
why shouldn't I demand dowry?

1264
01:28:35,917 --> 01:28:37,750
Start second service immediately.

1265
01:28:38,042 --> 01:28:38,833
Bloody!

1266
01:28:39,167 --> 01:28:41,875
Do it after trips is over,
customer service is important.

1267
01:28:49,458 --> 01:28:51,333
Deal matrimonial?

01:28:51,542 --> 01:28:53,125
For my daughter, sir.

01:28:53,917 --> 01:28:58,042
Log in into our website, upload photos
and details about your daughter.

1270
01:28:58,250 --> 01:29:01,583
Pay online and wait with receipt.

1271
01:29:18,292 --> 01:29:19,417
Don't yuo like anyone?

1272
01:29:20,417 --> 01:29:21,458
What sort of groom you wish for?

1273
01:29:21,625 --> 01:29:25,833
Find a brave groom,
who can hit 10 people at a time.

1274
01:29:26,042 --> 01:29:27,750
Is Spiderman okay?

1275
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:30,708
Superman?

1276
01:29:32,625 --> 01:29:33,500
My fate!

1277
01:29:33,667 --> 01:29:35,667
Batman?
- He's also okay.

1278
01:29:35,875 --> 01:29:37,167
Temple Runner?

1279
01:29:37,375 --> 01:29:39,458
You suggested perfect match
for my daughter.

1280
01:29:39,667 --> 01:29:43,167
We can design such grooms only
on computers using graphics.

1281
01:29:43,375 --> 01:29:44,458
I can't.

1282
01:29:44,625 --> 01:29:47,958
I paid Rs.50000 online for
my daughter, sir.

1283
01:29:48,542 --> 01:29:49,792
Is it platinum scheme?

1284
01:29:50,625 --> 01:29:52,167
I'll fix the deal on the spot.

1285
01:30:01,458 --> 01:30:02,958
He's the right man to take on
that fraud.

1286
01:30:03,167 --> 01:30:04,667
I'll say okay to him.

1287
01:30:07,167 --> 01:30:10,417
Details about him...
- No need to say anything.

1288
01:30:10,583 --> 01:30:12,708
I like him so much.

1289
01:30:13,958 --> 01:30:15,250
She likes him.

1290
01:30:15,417 --> 01:30:18,167
What else?
Should we submit her horoscope?

1291
01:30:20,125 --> 01:30:21,750
Tell me your Facebook Id.

1292
01:30:33,917 --> 01:30:35,917
After studying profile pictures
of Abhi and Bruce Lee,

1293
01:30:36,125 --> 01:30:38,958
likes, comments and their status.

1294
01:30:39,167 --> 01:30:41,042
They match 90%

1295
01:30:42,708 --> 01:30:45,625
Its equal to matching horoscopes.

1296
01:30:46,042 --> 01:30:48,167
I'll ask groom's people
to talk to you on Skype.

1297
01:30:48,375 --> 01:30:50,542
Fix engagement in near future.

1298
01:30:56,917 --> 01:30:59,750
Accidentally, this marriage got
fixed in video conference.

1299
01:30:59,958 --> 01:31:01,083
Okay, but where's the groom?

1300
01:31:01,292 --> 01:31:04,000
He's coming in the next ambulance
to meet the bride.

1301
01:31:04,208 --> 01:31:05,500
Why ambulance for that?

1302
01:31:05,708 --> 01:31:08,292
We run ambulance service
with 10 ambulances.

1303
01:31:08,458 --> 01:31:10,875
It'll be honourable if we come
in our own vehicle, right?

1304
01:31:11,083 --> 01:31:14,875
Yes, indeed it's very honourable to
come in ambulance to meet the bride.

1305
01:31:27,792 --> 01:31:28,792
Welcome, son-in-law.

1306
01:31:36,917 --> 01:31:41,042
Sitting around like this,
the bride comes and offers coffee.

1307
01:31:41,250 --> 01:31:43,250
then you ask bride if she likes him,

1308
01:31:43,417 --> 01:31:44,708
this is old trend,

1309
01:31:44,917 --> 01:31:45,833
is there anything new?

1310
01:31:46,042 --> 01:31:49,958
Father, I want to talk to Bruce Lee.

1311
01:31:50,167 --> 01:31:51,458
This is new.

1312
01:31:54,833 --> 01:31:57,750
I felt excited on hearing the
name Bruce Lee.

1313
01:31:57,958 --> 01:32:00,750
I felt like bashing up 10 men at a time.

1314
01:32:01,292 --> 01:32:03,292
Hit 10 people?

1315
01:32:03,917 --> 01:32:06,667
You can do it.
You'll do it, won't you?

1316
01:32:08,458 --> 01:32:09,750
I can.

1317
01:32:10,042 --> 01:32:15,542
I said okay to you because my friend Sundarambal
has been locked up in house by her father.

1318
01:32:15,750 --> 01:32:19,292
you must free her from there and
get her married to Bhagat Singh.

1319
01:32:19,458 --> 01:32:20,792
Will you do it?

1320
01:32:23,292 --> 01:32:24,875
I'll do it for you.

1321
01:32:26,625 --> 01:32:28,125
Come, let's get engaged.

1322
01:32:29,792 --> 01:32:31,917
This is also new.

1323
01:32:40,292 --> 01:32:43,792
Father...father...

1324
01:32:44,125 --> 01:32:46,583
At least you listen to me, mother.
- Did you hear about this comedy?

1325
01:32:46,792 --> 01:32:47,458
Please listen to me, mother.

1326
01:32:47,667 --> 01:32:48,792
Please listen to me, mother...
- Move out of my way.

1327
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:50,875
Groom's people came in an ambulance.

1328
01:32:51,083 --> 01:32:53,917
Keep that...here.
- Okay...okay...

1329
01:32:54,667 --> 01:32:56,792
Look here...
- Will you listen to me or not, mom?

1330
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,250
They're coming and going
in ambulance.

1331
01:32:59,417 --> 01:33:02,292
They have found a crazy family.

1332
01:33:02,583 --> 01:33:05,875
Are we anything less?
Our son too is marrying a thief's daughter.

1333
01:33:06,083 --> 01:33:08,542
You've misunderstood me, father...
- What?

1334
01:33:08,750 --> 01:33:10,250
I asked for coffee, right?
- Your coffee is here.

1335
01:33:10,458 --> 01:33:12,542
Coffee is here, where's tea?
- Tea...

1336
01:33:12,750 --> 01:33:13,625
Son-in-law!

1337
01:33:13,833 --> 01:33:16,208
Hubby, people you were expecting are here.

1338
01:33:16,375 --> 01:33:21,042
Hubby, father-in-law has sent bike
with henchmen for his son-in-law.

1339
01:33:21,250 --> 01:33:22,375
Ask one who wants it to go.

1340
01:33:22,583 --> 01:33:23,667
Mother, please listen to me.

1341
01:33:23,875 --> 01:33:25,875
Why are you staring at me?
Go, son.

1342
01:33:26,083 --> 01:33:26,667
Go.

1343
01:33:26,875 --> 01:33:28,750
You won't listen to me, right?

1344
01:33:28,958 --> 01:33:30,375
Hubby...
- Poor kid.

1345
01:33:30,583 --> 01:33:32,833
Nothing will happen, let him go...wait.

1346
01:33:40,208 --> 01:33:41,250
What do you want?

1347
01:33:41,458 --> 01:33:43,667
We came to take good care
of son-in-law.

1348
01:33:45,917 --> 01:33:50,000
Till yesterday you were nothing,
today you're brother's son-in-law.

1349
01:33:52,792 --> 01:33:54,667
Brother has sent you new bike.

1350
01:33:54,667 --> 01:33:56,500
Take a ride and
give your opinion on it.

1351
01:33:56,708 --> 01:33:59,292
If you don't like it, no problem,
we can buy a bigger better bike.

1352
01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:03,000
It seems your bike is too old.

1353
01:34:03,917 --> 01:34:06,667
How's the ambulance drive?
Isn't it new experience, Maya?

1354
01:34:06,875 --> 01:34:11,125
Exhilarating! Indeed very proud
to travel in ambulance.

1355
01:34:17,708 --> 01:34:21,542
Those are Kasi's men.

1356
01:34:21,708 --> 01:34:24,417
The guy in checked shirt is Siva.

1357
01:34:24,583 --> 01:34:26,542
The man who is going to marry
my friend Sundarambal.

1358
01:34:26,708 --> 01:34:30,667
Add his name also in your list.
He's responsible for everything.

1359
01:34:30,875 --> 01:34:36,667
Today only we got engaged,
do we need violence so quickly?

1360
01:34:36,875 --> 01:34:41,458
Why not show a sample
just to make me happy?

1361
01:34:41,625 --> 01:34:44,667
Son-in-law, take a ride before
auspicious time elapses.

1362
01:34:44,875 --> 01:34:45,750
Come.

1363
01:34:51,667 --> 01:34:56,417
His bad time has started.
Show him his place.

1364
01:34:57,458 --> 01:34:59,167
Go...go...go...

1365
01:35:05,375 --> 01:35:07,750
Welcome Lee....Bruce Lee!

1366
01:35:09,250 --> 01:35:11,917
Are you the tube light
to match that round bulb?

1367
01:35:12,125 --> 01:35:16,458
Sethu, he's my cousin,
please take care of him.

1368
01:35:16,625 --> 01:35:17,708
Then, he's from groom's side.

1369
01:35:17,917 --> 01:35:19,792
Inform brother and
get him a gear less bike.

1370
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:20,750
Okay, brother.

1371
01:35:21,333 --> 01:35:24,792
Ambulance is here,
you're blocking road like bulls.

1372
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:26,333
Are you shouting on us?

1373
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:28,875
Stop!

1374
01:35:29,083 --> 01:35:31,833
He's from groom's side, boss has
ordered to take whatever they give.

1375
01:35:32,042 --> 01:35:33,208
Is it?

1376
01:35:42,667 --> 01:35:44,125
Bash him, Bruce!

1377
01:35:44,333 --> 01:35:45,583
Just one more punch.

1378
01:35:47,625 --> 01:35:49,000
What happened, brother?

1379
01:35:49,208 --> 01:35:52,125
Groom's side, don't get tensed.

1380
01:35:52,333 --> 01:35:53,583
Just say yes, we'll kill him.

1381
01:35:53,792 --> 01:35:56,125
No, chewing gum dialogue for me.

1382
01:36:01,208 --> 01:36:03,083
Are you happy, Abhi?

1383
01:36:15,792 --> 01:36:17,083
Enemy's blood!

1384
01:36:21,958 --> 01:36:26,458
You don't have to hit them anymore.
You must hit Kasi.

1385
01:36:30,583 --> 01:36:33,083
Looks like that is son-in-law.
- Yes, brother.

1386
01:36:34,167 --> 01:36:36,417
I went on a round before
auspicious time elapses.

1387
01:36:36,583 --> 01:36:39,208
We too had 3 rounds.

1388
01:36:39,750 --> 01:36:46,708
I got thrashed by your cousin,
won't you ask what happened?

1389
01:36:46,917 --> 01:36:49,208
Cousin?
I don't even know who he is!

1390
01:36:49,417 --> 01:36:50,708
Don't know who he is!

1391
01:36:50,958 --> 01:36:55,000
Oh no! The felled a banyan tree!

1392
01:37:06,667 --> 01:37:09,500
Thrash them black and blue,
we're finishing Kasi once for all.

1393
01:37:09,708 --> 01:37:12,375
We're kidnapping my friend and
get her married to Bhagat Singh.

1394
01:37:12,542 --> 01:37:15,833
Start your game,
don't take too much time.

1395
01:37:23,708 --> 01:37:26,083
Who is Kasi?
Who is Kasi?

1396
01:37:30,625 --> 01:37:32,458
Don't you know who Kasi is?

1397
01:37:33,542 --> 01:37:35,958
I know...he's standing up there.

1398
01:37:36,167 --> 01:37:37,667
Who is it, Sethu?

1399
01:37:37,875 --> 01:37:42,000
Brother, it's simple pencil matter,
I'll sharpen it myself.

1400
01:37:42,208 --> 01:37:45,375
You carry on.
- Come...come...

1401
01:37:49,292 --> 01:37:51,750
What a thrashing!

1402
01:37:56,083 --> 01:37:58,333
Thrash them...
thrash them black and blue.

1403
01:38:06,458 --> 01:38:07,917
Not enough!

1404
01:38:09,833 --> 01:38:11,167
Can't take it anymore!

1405
01:38:15,417 --> 01:38:17,875
Why did you do like this?
It's paining terribly.

1406
01:38:18,833 --> 01:38:22,125
Is it blood marks for hitting them?

1407
01:38:22,333 --> 01:38:24,708
It's not blood for hitting us.

1408
01:38:25,375 --> 01:38:28,042
He's bleeding because we poked him.

1409
01:38:34,833 --> 01:38:36,583
This too appears new!

1410
01:38:52,792 --> 01:38:54,417
Look at Abhi there!

1411
01:39:01,042 --> 01:39:05,292
I thought of uniting her with Buck
but she's going out with him.

1412
01:39:22,375 --> 01:39:26,250
Your father said I'm his son-in-law,
Buck is furious on me.

1413
01:40:41,750 --> 01:40:42,292
Who are you?

1414
01:40:43,375 --> 01:40:44,542
Where did you come from?

1415
01:40:45,083 --> 01:40:47,167
Why did you become my friend?

1416
01:40:48,875 --> 01:40:51,292
Why are you doing so much for me?
Why?

1417
01:40:52,042 --> 01:40:52,917
Why?

1418
01:40:55,833 --> 01:40:57,750
Friendship!
- Oh my God!

1419
01:40:58,500 --> 01:40:59,500
Love!

1420
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:01,625
Will you please go?
- Go...

1421
01:41:04,125 --> 01:41:05,333
Enjoy!

1422
01:41:28,125 --> 01:41:30,000
Brother!
- Tell me.

1423
01:42:02,542 --> 01:42:04,375
Come...come...look there!

1424
01:42:09,292 --> 01:42:10,750
Bloody rascal!

1425
01:42:10,958 --> 01:42:14,750
They're acting, brother. Just now I saw him,
they're acting.- My son-in-law!

1426
01:42:15,417 --> 01:42:16,417
Enjoy!

1427
01:42:17,542 --> 01:42:18,792
What happened?
- Your father.

1428
01:42:23,917 --> 01:42:25,625
Fool, follow me.

1429
01:42:31,917 --> 01:42:33,417
How did they change suddenly?

1430
01:42:38,042 --> 01:42:40,167
Someday you will get caught.

1431
01:42:48,208 --> 01:42:49,625
What's going on here?

1432
01:42:49,792 --> 01:42:52,250
Keep in your mind I'm here
when you act, please.

1433
01:42:52,417 --> 01:42:54,625
You're living the roles.

1434
01:42:55,750 --> 01:42:58,875
You're great! How could you do it?

1435
01:42:59,083 --> 01:43:01,167
You're giving same performance
for both of us.

1436
01:43:01,375 --> 01:43:05,500
Only we are different,
but your feelings are same.

1437
01:43:05,875 --> 01:43:07,958
Siva!
- No, Buck.

1438
01:43:08,208 --> 01:43:10,750
Buddy! Are you suspecting us?
- Yes.

1439
01:43:10,958 --> 01:43:13,375
Had I not come here,
they would've thrashed you.

1440
01:43:13,625 --> 01:43:15,208
Your words are hurting me, buddy.

1441
01:43:17,708 --> 01:43:18,708
Sorry buddy.

1442
01:43:19,458 --> 01:43:20,458
Who are you?

1443
01:43:20,667 --> 01:43:21,792
Where did you come from?

1444
01:43:22,458 --> 01:43:24,250
Why did you become my friend?

1445
01:43:24,417 --> 01:43:28,583
Why are you doing so much for me?
Why?

1446
01:43:28,875 --> 01:43:30,083
Why?

1447
01:43:32,125 --> 01:43:33,958
Why is he thinking so much?

1448
01:43:35,292 --> 01:43:37,917
Friendship!
- Oh no!

1449
01:43:38,667 --> 01:43:39,542
I can understand.

1450
01:43:42,250 --> 01:43:45,333
Its love now...
So, will you please...

1451
01:43:47,958 --> 01:43:49,208
Enjoy!

1452
01:44:03,292 --> 01:44:04,292
Please give me little.

1453
01:44:04,458 --> 01:44:07,583
I'll order another juice,
you have it fully.

1454
01:44:12,250 --> 01:44:13,250
What are you looking at?

1455
01:44:13,417 --> 01:44:17,708
You saw me coming on bike with Siva
and now sitting with Buck.

1456
01:44:18,125 --> 01:44:20,583
This is true.
What you earlier saw was false!

1457
01:44:20,792 --> 01:44:23,625
Will you hug him tightly for that?

1458
01:44:24,333 --> 01:44:26,667
That too sitting closely and
rubbing against him.

1459
01:44:27,875 --> 01:44:29,708
Yes, I did it wantonly.

1460
01:44:29,917 --> 01:44:32,458
Is it right whatever she's doing, Buck?

1461
01:44:32,667 --> 01:44:35,208
Even when I saw them,
they were hugging each other.

1462
01:44:35,375 --> 01:44:39,417
No problem, it was fine.
- Stop it. Are you humans?

1463
01:44:39,625 --> 01:44:42,792
You're accusing as if we're at fault.

1464
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,583
Whatever fault was yours.
- Did I?- Yes.

1465
01:44:45,792 --> 01:44:47,292
The moment Siva said he liked me,

1466
01:44:47,458 --> 01:44:51,000
you fixed your marriage with
a guy known as Bruce Lee.

1467
01:44:51,208 --> 01:44:52,833
In what way that was right?

1468
01:44:53,042 --> 01:44:57,125
But Siva isn't like that,
he still loves only you.

1469
01:44:57,917 --> 01:45:04,042
He said he liked me, all these arrangements
of engagement and marriage is for us.

1470
01:45:04,250 --> 01:45:07,000
Siva is doing all this
to unite me with Bhagat.

1471
01:45:07,208 --> 01:45:10,958
Without knowing this, you're getting
ready to marry an idiot, get lost.

1472
01:45:11,167 --> 01:45:13,750
I wanted you to come and ask me,
I wanted you to know the truth,

1473
01:45:13,958 --> 01:45:15,625
That's why I hugged Siva.

1474
01:45:15,833 --> 01:45:18,958
Siva is in your heart,
that has dragged you to me.

1475
01:45:19,167 --> 01:45:22,542
Our love will end with marriage,
Siva will unite us at any cost.

1476
01:45:22,750 --> 01:45:25,208
But you...?
- It's over!

1477
01:45:25,375 --> 01:45:27,500
Shall we order one more?
- Oh yes.

1478
01:45:54,458 --> 01:46:00,417
Buddy, you should've seen her face change
as she told about your sacrifice for friendship.

1479
01:46:00,583 --> 01:46:05,417
She left in love mood.
Watch out, she'll come for you.

1480
01:46:05,583 --> 01:46:07,458
I know she'll come for me.

1481
01:46:07,625 --> 01:46:12,208
I'm just waiting when that magical
moment will come and how...

1482
01:46:12,417 --> 01:46:15,250
Then, you too love her...

1483
01:46:16,208 --> 01:46:19,208
Looks like she's coming here.

1484
01:46:19,417 --> 01:46:20,583
He too is here.

1485
01:46:22,833 --> 01:46:24,083
I came for you only.

1486
01:46:24,292 --> 01:46:26,417
Outer wounds have healed.

1487
01:46:26,583 --> 01:46:32,167
Dr.Srinivasan said it'll take a week
for inner wounds to heal.

1488
01:46:34,833 --> 01:46:36,667
Are you feeling for me, Abhi?

1489
01:46:37,792 --> 01:46:41,750
If I don't become normal Bruce Lee in
a week, kick Kasi and kidnap his daughter...

1490
01:46:41,958 --> 01:46:43,208
No need to do that.

1491
01:46:43,417 --> 01:46:45,875
Bruce Lee, we'll not jell well.
- What?

1492
01:46:46,125 --> 01:46:50,042
Find someone like Arundhati
or Rudramadevi for your style.

1493
01:46:50,250 --> 01:46:52,292
They'll perfectly match you.

1494
01:46:53,875 --> 01:46:56,083
You're not the perfect match for me.

1495
01:46:58,458 --> 01:47:00,667
Will you go or shall I take out pencil?

1496
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:09,292
Buddy, we can trust girls
who accept love immediately.

1497
01:47:09,458 --> 01:47:18,042
But girls who make us go crazy with
their eccentric behaviour and indecision.

1498
01:47:18,250 --> 01:47:20,542
Never trust such girls, buddy.

1499
01:47:21,458 --> 01:47:24,750
If we express our love,
they say no kick in it.

1500
01:47:24,958 --> 01:47:28,042
If we ask them to express,
they say why this rush?

1501
01:47:28,208 --> 01:47:31,042
How can we know their love then?

1502
01:47:33,458 --> 01:47:36,292
If there's problem in love,
we think how to solve it.

1503
01:47:36,458 --> 01:47:38,333
But girls think of
how to change their man.

1504
01:47:38,500 --> 01:47:39,500
You're right, buddy.

1505
01:47:39,708 --> 01:47:42,417
Stop it!
You were talking about me, right?

1506
01:47:42,625 --> 01:47:44,125
What do you know about me?

1507
01:47:45,417 --> 01:47:46,500
When did you come here, Abhi?

1508
01:47:57,417 --> 01:47:58,917
I did come here to tell you.

1509
01:47:59,292 --> 01:48:02,208
But now I'm telling you
for the last time.

1510
01:48:02,792 --> 01:48:05,792
You considered me so cheap, right?

1511
01:48:06,500 --> 01:48:08,375
You've misunderstood me, Abhi?

1512
01:48:10,292 --> 01:48:16,458
He's my Bruce Lee, he'll give his body,
heart, blood, life and soul for me.

1513
01:48:17,083 --> 01:48:20,792
I'll marry him as you watch
and walk away majestically.

1514
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:21,625
Come.

1515
01:48:23,208 --> 01:48:24,583
Wait.
- Leave me...I'll come.

1516
01:48:24,792 --> 01:48:27,292
I'll marry before you.

1517
01:48:27,708 --> 01:48:30,917
I'll come.
- Abhi weds Bruce Lee.

1518
01:48:31,458 --> 01:48:32,208
Come.

1519
01:48:34,458 --> 01:48:35,708
Why did you do like this?

1520
01:48:35,958 --> 01:48:38,250
She came here to express
her love to you.

1521
01:48:38,417 --> 01:48:41,417
I don't see love in her eyes,
I see only arrogance.

1522
01:48:43,375 --> 01:48:47,000
The day she realizes love,
facing me, looking into my eyes,

1523
01:48:47,208 --> 01:48:50,458
when she says I love you,
I'll believe her love that day.

1524
01:48:53,375 --> 01:48:54,958
I'll collect it next time.

1525
01:48:55,167 --> 01:48:56,542
Excuse sir, call for your father.

1526
01:49:02,292 --> 01:49:04,583
Where's father?
- Father is talking to someone inside.

1527
01:49:07,042 --> 01:49:08,042
Mayan!

1528
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:12,917
Villagers may unite.
But our enmity will not end.

1529
01:49:13,125 --> 01:49:15,708
Save yourself and your son.

1530
01:49:16,417 --> 01:49:17,542
If possible!

1531
01:49:26,500 --> 01:49:29,292
I feel it happened yesterday,
brother-in-law.

1532
01:49:29,500 --> 01:49:34,833
We raised our children telling them
they would become man and wife.

1533
01:49:35,042 --> 01:49:39,125
But today...? Did we come all this far
facing so much flak for this?

1534
01:49:41,042 --> 01:49:42,917
Kinsman's shop is brilliant.

1535
01:49:43,167 --> 01:49:46,292
I think we stock every idol smuggled
in Tamil Nadu here, there's so much place.

1536
01:49:46,500 --> 01:49:47,625
Boy!

1537
01:49:49,542 --> 01:49:51,125
What's this?

1538
01:49:51,917 --> 01:49:54,250
Look, don't put a tag and
sell it cheaply.

1539
01:49:54,417 --> 01:49:56,375
Smuggled idol, very expensive.

1540
01:49:56,583 --> 01:50:00,000
Kinsman! You said I’m not equal to you, right?

1541
01:50:00,208 --> 01:50:03,000
Now I'm sitting before you equally.

1542
01:50:03,208 --> 01:50:05,583
Your son Siva is responsible for this.

1543
01:50:05,792 --> 01:50:08,542
What are you watching boys?
Order tea or coffee for kinsman.

1544
01:50:08,750 --> 01:50:10,042
I'll order cool drinks.
Give me way, please.

1545
01:50:10,250 --> 01:50:13,250
Give kinsman's shop address
for all our clients.

1546
01:50:13,458 --> 01:50:14,167
I'll inform.

1547
01:50:14,333 --> 01:50:18,083
We've to protect our culture,
right Kinsman?

1548
01:50:21,167 --> 01:50:24,458
I'm in my kinsman's shop.
Yes, he called me here.

1549
01:50:24,625 --> 01:50:25,375
Steal it.

1550
01:50:25,583 --> 01:50:26,583
I'll come...come, boys...

1551
01:50:26,792 --> 01:50:28,542
Looks like a big fish,
let's go, boys.

1552
01:50:28,750 --> 01:50:32,000
Why are you silent, brother-in-law?
I can't take it anymore, I will....

1553
01:50:32,208 --> 01:50:33,667
Brother-in-law!

1554
01:50:40,833 --> 01:50:43,542
You're going to marry a beautiful girl
with 6 month warranty.

1555
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:48,333
I'll give the first invitation
to my kinsman.

1556
01:50:48,542 --> 01:50:50,167
Invite all our friends.

1557
01:50:50,333 --> 01:50:51,958
Police is searching for most
of our guest list.

1558
01:50:52,167 --> 01:50:53,083
How can I find them?

1559
01:50:53,250 --> 01:50:55,167
Anyway, I'll try to find and
invite them, brother.- Go, boys.

1560
01:50:56,208 --> 01:51:00,500
I told them not to print
my friend's lover's full name,

1561
01:51:00,708 --> 01:51:02,417
and he may feel bad about it.

1562
01:51:02,958 --> 01:51:04,708
They didn't listen to me.

1563
01:51:06,333 --> 01:51:09,208
How's the invitation?
Isn't it grand?

1564
01:51:09,458 --> 01:51:10,625
This is not fair, buddy.

1565
01:51:11,208 --> 01:51:17,167
You're the only one in this world to invite
a friend to your marriage with his lover.

1566
01:51:17,500 --> 01:51:20,167
I'll never forget you in my life.

1567
01:51:20,375 --> 01:51:21,875
My name is only in wedding invitation.

1568
01:51:22,083 --> 01:51:23,458
Buddy, you're marrying her.

1569
01:51:23,667 --> 01:51:27,958
The plan is till my marriage only, right?
- Any doubt?

1570
01:51:28,167 --> 01:51:30,083
You're making so many plans
to unite me with my love.

1571
01:51:30,250 --> 01:51:32,500
But your lover is going to marry
that spring head Bruce Lee.

1572
01:51:32,708 --> 01:51:34,875
Why are you not doing
anything to stop it?

1573
01:51:35,083 --> 01:51:37,167
Buddy!

1574
01:51:54,583 --> 01:51:58,083
Heart is like merry-go-round...

1575
01:51:58,208 --> 01:52:01,958
Whispering secret in ears...

1576
01:52:02,125 --> 01:52:05,500
Youth is in dreams...

1577
01:52:05,708 --> 01:52:09,625
Heart is floating in wind...

1578
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:37,208
It's happy smiles everywhere...

1579
01:52:37,417 --> 01:52:41,042
Everyone is enjoying the fun...

1580
01:52:41,208 --> 01:52:45,000
It's shining silks and
glittering jewels everywhere...

1581
01:52:45,167 --> 01:52:49,208
As chant of Vedas fill the air...

1582
01:52:49,417 --> 01:52:55,000
Marriage...marriage...grand marriage...

1583
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:26,167
Hearts of parents and children
are thinking differently...

1584
01:53:26,375 --> 01:53:35,000
What would happen and
when would it happen? I'm confused...

1585
01:53:49,333 --> 01:53:57,042
Bride and groom are chatting in the
time they get amidst this confusion...

1586
01:53:57,208 --> 01:54:03,958
Brother-in-law and uncle are
singing and dancing...

1587
01:55:20,792 --> 01:55:22,250
Have we gone overboard?

1588
01:55:25,625 --> 01:55:30,625
My son will answer perfectly
to any question.

1589
01:55:30,833 --> 01:55:33,000
How am I going to get him
married to her, brother?

1590
01:55:33,208 --> 01:55:35,042
What happened?
- Asking me what happened?

1591
01:55:35,250 --> 01:55:37,208
You asked us to dance,
we went overboard.

1592
01:55:37,417 --> 01:55:39,417
You asked us to sing,
we went overboard.

1593
01:55:39,583 --> 01:55:42,625
But you managed to split
Abhi and Siva, right?

1594
01:55:45,250 --> 01:55:48,792
Tomorrow morning our son Siva
will marry Abhi.

1595
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:49,833
How will it happen, brother-in-law?

1596
01:55:50,042 --> 01:55:53,208
It will happen.
If I say it will happen.

1597
01:55:53,417 --> 01:55:59,000
Tomorrow morning at 5 AM,
I'll kidnap Bruce Lee and Sundarambal.

1598
01:56:00,250 --> 01:56:05,083
As planned you conduct the
marriage your son with Abhi.

1599
01:56:07,667 --> 01:56:10,167
You didn't hand over me to police, right?

1600
01:56:10,458 --> 01:56:11,750
This is repaying my gratitude.

1601
01:56:11,958 --> 01:56:13,375
Look, how I smashed it!

1602
01:56:13,542 --> 01:56:15,542
Oh my pumpkin!

1603
01:56:16,125 --> 01:56:16,750
Brother-in-law!

1604
01:56:16,958 --> 01:56:18,792
Rajalakshmi! This is not our bedroom.

1605
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,708
Why are you telling that? I feel shy!

1606
01:56:24,083 --> 01:56:27,000
Let's not be here,
hey silly girl, come.

1607
01:56:58,708 --> 01:57:01,333
If I say no, will you give up?

1608
01:57:01,500 --> 01:57:03,708
If you say no, I will give up.

1609
01:57:09,125 --> 01:57:10,042
I can't give you up.

1610
01:57:10,250 --> 01:57:11,375
I won't give you up.

1611
01:57:19,167 --> 01:57:21,125
What's this sudden realization?

1612
01:57:21,417 --> 01:57:22,208
Newly?

1613
01:57:22,417 --> 01:57:26,042
No, I like you very much from
very young age.

1614
01:57:26,583 --> 01:57:30,667
Fighting, arguing, staring angrily,
all my feelings are with you only.

1615
01:57:31,250 --> 01:57:34,875
As usual I had a fight with you and
fixed my marriage with Bruce Lee.

1616
01:57:35,083 --> 01:57:35,792
Enough!

1617
01:57:35,958 --> 01:57:36,625
Go.

1618
01:57:37,208 --> 01:57:38,083
No.

1619
01:57:38,708 --> 01:57:39,917
I want you.

1620
01:57:40,208 --> 01:57:42,792
Tomorrow morning
you're marrying Bruce Lee. Go.

1621
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:46,208
I say I won't leave you but
you're ready to dump me.

1622
01:57:46,375 --> 01:57:47,333
Will you go away?

1623
01:57:47,500 --> 01:57:48,792
I agree openly.

1624
01:57:49,167 --> 01:57:52,625
When his finger touches me,
I felt like it was your touch.

1625
01:57:53,250 --> 01:57:54,792
I was thinking about you only.

1626
01:57:56,708 --> 01:58:00,167
I made a mistake,
I can't live without you, Siva.

1627
01:58:00,375 --> 01:58:02,750
Why are you showing me new film?
Should I believe you?

1628
01:58:02,958 --> 01:58:03,917
What should I do to make you believe me?

1629
01:58:04,125 --> 01:58:09,333
What should I do to make you believe me?

1630
01:58:15,958 --> 01:58:17,292
Will you believe me now?

1631
01:58:19,083 --> 01:58:20,542
Slightly...

1632
01:58:24,125 --> 01:58:25,167
You...

1633
01:58:25,833 --> 01:58:28,542
I'm accepting my love shamelessly,
you're over acting.

1634
01:58:32,375 --> 01:58:33,875
I love you fat girl.

1635
01:58:36,667 --> 01:58:39,958
You love me from young age only.

1636
01:58:40,167 --> 01:58:41,667
I love you from days of fetus.

1637
01:58:41,875 --> 01:58:45,458
You always claim proudly to have
born a second earlier than me.

1638
01:58:45,667 --> 01:58:48,333
I gave up, that's why you were
born a second earlier.

1639
01:58:48,542 --> 01:58:51,583
Reason for it,
I love you since those days.

1640
01:58:52,583 --> 01:58:55,875
You're the only lover in the world
to fall in love as fetus.

1641
01:59:00,167 --> 01:59:02,167
Okay, let's marry.

1642
01:59:19,333 --> 01:59:25,958
He told me great about uniting with his love
but didn't say a word about union with my love.

1643
01:59:26,333 --> 01:59:30,417
I'll find my love Su and
then take him to task.

1644
01:59:34,542 --> 01:59:36,917
Buddy!
- Traitor! Leave me.

1645
01:59:37,292 --> 01:59:39,125
Be happy...be happy!

1646
01:59:39,292 --> 01:59:41,292
You both are united, what about us?

1647
01:59:41,500 --> 01:59:47,292
Buddy, I'll get you married to your love
tomorrow at 5 am under the same canopy.

1648
01:59:47,500 --> 01:59:49,000
Tomorrow morning at 5 am?

1649
01:59:49,208 --> 01:59:51,000
No way, I'll marry her right now.

1650
01:59:51,208 --> 01:59:53,167
No...
- What?

1651
01:59:53,333 --> 01:59:57,167
Kasi's men are waiting outside
to finish you.

1652
01:59:57,333 --> 02:00:00,208
If you go outside, you're dead.
Is it okay?

1653
02:00:01,042 --> 02:00:02,333
Please listen to me.

1654
02:00:02,542 --> 02:00:03,417
Okay.

1655
02:00:04,583 --> 02:00:05,833
Settle it for 5 am marriage, buddy.

1656
02:00:06,042 --> 02:00:10,375
Our marriage is fixed at 9 to 10.30 am.

1657
02:00:10,583 --> 02:00:14,583
As per our plan, we're calling priest
at 5 am and getting married.

1658
02:00:14,792 --> 02:00:15,792
Okay?

1659
02:00:16,542 --> 02:00:20,292
How can priest come as per our plan?
- My father will take care of it.

1660
02:00:20,500 --> 02:00:22,917
How can he talk to him?
- Watch now.

1661
02:00:25,875 --> 02:00:28,250
Tell me, brother.

1662
02:00:28,458 --> 02:00:30,125
A small change in auspicious time.

1663
02:00:30,292 --> 02:00:34,875
Let's conduct Siva's marriage at 5 am.
- 5 am?

1664
02:00:35,083 --> 02:00:37,875
Very auspicious time, let's do it.

1665
02:00:38,083 --> 02:00:40,417
Good. Happy to hear it.

1666
02:00:42,542 --> 02:00:43,542
How is it?

1667
02:00:46,208 --> 02:00:47,667
Why are you saying it sadly?

1668
02:00:47,875 --> 02:00:52,042
Waking up early morning at 5 am
and jumping the wall,

1669
02:00:52,208 --> 02:00:53,125
do I need to take this risk?

1670
02:00:53,333 --> 02:00:56,875
Send her now, we'll marry tonight
somewhere else.

1671
02:00:57,083 --> 02:00:58,458
Look, how she's rushing for it.

1672
02:01:02,792 --> 02:01:06,083
Okay buddy, we'll follow your plan.

1673
02:01:06,833 --> 02:01:08,458
Don't know what's going to happen.

1674
02:01:09,125 --> 02:01:13,125
This plan is till we get married, right?

1675
02:01:14,083 --> 02:01:16,125
Why are you still saying doubtfully?

1676
02:01:16,333 --> 02:01:17,792
Buck, come...we're getting late.

1677
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,750
We're getting married
tomorrow morning at 5, dear.

1678
02:01:21,750 --> 02:01:23,042
It's friendship!

1679
02:01:23,208 --> 02:01:26,958
Let our marriage get over.
- Our marriage will happen as you wished.

1680
02:01:27,542 --> 02:01:29,625
What's this?

1681
02:01:30,417 --> 02:01:33,792
Tomorrow's marriage isn't
between you and me.

1682
02:01:34,417 --> 02:01:36,042
Let's break up.

1683
02:01:38,667 --> 02:01:41,583
Tomorrow we're getting married,
come for dinner at night.

1684
02:01:41,792 --> 02:01:44,000
He's not troublesome man,
good groom.

1685
02:01:45,458 --> 02:01:47,042
This too is new!

1686
02:01:53,083 --> 02:01:54,917
We're kidnapping groom by 5 am.

1687
02:01:59,833 --> 02:02:01,958
Tomorrow morning at 5 am,
we're kidnapping the bride.

1688
02:02:20,167 --> 02:02:23,125
Are you cheating brother Kasi?
Sinners!

1689
02:02:25,875 --> 02:02:28,125
Got caught red handed this time.

1690
02:02:40,042 --> 02:02:41,167
I'll do once.

1691
02:02:42,667 --> 02:02:47,542
Siva, I always lose to you,
I'll come back with brother.

1692
02:02:48,625 --> 02:02:52,167
Is everything going on fine?
- Everything is fine.

1693
02:02:52,375 --> 02:02:55,125
Brother, come.
- What?

1694
02:02:55,333 --> 02:02:57,833
It's not a matter to say but see.

1695
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,208
Come.
Come, brother.

1696
02:03:00,500 --> 02:03:01,958
Come, brother...see there!

1697
02:03:04,958 --> 02:03:05,958
My darling!

1698
02:03:06,125 --> 02:03:07,292
My sweetheart!

1699
02:03:07,500 --> 02:03:09,333
My lovely!

1700
02:03:12,833 --> 02:03:14,333
Will it be Bruce Lee weds Abhi?

1701
02:03:14,542 --> 02:03:16,000
For the present yes...

1702
02:03:17,958 --> 02:03:22,000
Are you showing to father
his daughter's romance?

1703
02:03:22,208 --> 02:03:22,958
I'll hit you.

1704
02:03:23,125 --> 02:03:25,792
Brother...brother...
I saw with my eyes, brother.

1705
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:27,833
Just now I saw them.

1706
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:29,917
Let your romance carry on, son-in-law.
- Okay, father-in-law.

1707
02:03:30,083 --> 02:03:34,708
Brother...brother...brother...
Don't hit me...

1708
02:03:38,583 --> 02:03:39,792
Let's start romance.

1709
02:03:41,917 --> 02:03:43,042
Leave me, brother.

1710
02:03:43,250 --> 02:03:44,958
I expected this,
that's why I've evidence.

1711
02:03:45,125 --> 02:03:49,083
Look at this...see...see.

1712
02:03:49,292 --> 02:03:51,083
Is there a photo?

1713
02:03:51,958 --> 02:03:53,875
Why are you hitting after seeing photo?

1714
02:03:57,083 --> 02:04:01,250
You've taken a selfie and
showing it to me.

1715
02:04:01,458 --> 02:04:06,083
I've lost confidence in Siva.
Let's elope right now.

1716
02:04:08,458 --> 02:04:09,208
Buddy!

1717
02:04:10,792 --> 02:04:12,708
Still here? Didn't go?
- How can I go?

1718
02:04:13,833 --> 02:04:15,708
You hatched a plan to fix my marriage
with her, I agreed.

1719
02:04:15,917 --> 02:04:18,000
You said marriage at 5 am,
I agreed for that also.

1720
02:04:18,208 --> 02:04:21,625
You're kissing my lover
that too right before my eyes.

1721
02:04:21,833 --> 02:04:23,042
How could you do it?
- Are you suspecting me?

1722
02:04:23,250 --> 02:04:26,000
Keep quiet...Su, you too...

1723
02:04:27,417 --> 02:04:29,583
She's giving same performance.

1724
02:04:29,792 --> 02:04:33,000
If I hadn't given this performance,
they would've thrashed me.

1725
02:04:33,208 --> 02:04:34,875
You saw them, right? Go.

1726
02:04:36,042 --> 02:04:36,833
Okay, let's go.

1727
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:39,417
Oh no, come this side.
Go inside.

1728
02:04:39,625 --> 02:04:41,042
Morning 5 am.

1729
02:04:41,250 --> 02:04:43,208
Go...go inside.
- I'll come, dear.

1730
02:04:43,417 --> 02:04:45,417
Go...they may come.

1731
02:04:45,625 --> 02:04:47,042
Should I jump wall again?

1732
02:04:47,250 --> 02:04:50,000
My ex-army father is much better
than you and your torture.

1733
02:04:50,208 --> 02:04:52,333
I'll take you to task later.
- Okay, go....go.

1734
02:04:56,417 --> 02:05:01,000
I got up before you, groom.
Groom, marriage is at 5 am.

1735
02:05:01,208 --> 02:05:02,875
Getup and get ready quickly.

1736
02:05:09,375 --> 02:05:10,833
Marriage at 5 am?

1737
02:05:11,375 --> 02:05:12,875
This too is new.

1738
02:05:13,208 --> 02:05:15,250
I'm first in everything.

1739
02:05:20,375 --> 02:05:23,708
Are you ready, Sundarambal?
- I'm ready.

1740
02:05:24,208 --> 02:05:24,958
What?

1741
02:05:28,875 --> 02:05:30,417
Go...get ready quickly.

1742
02:05:30,583 --> 02:05:34,500
He's here, whom did I wake up now?

1743
02:05:43,917 --> 02:05:44,958
Where are you?
Are you here?

1744
02:05:45,167 --> 02:05:47,750
I'm here but I'm getting chased.
- Chased?

1745
02:05:47,917 --> 02:05:49,458
Who?
- Kasi's men.

1746
02:05:49,667 --> 02:05:51,125
I'm caught.
- Don't get caught, escape.

1747
02:05:51,333 --> 02:05:53,958
I expected you'd come to save me,
are you asking me to escape?

1748
02:05:54,167 --> 02:05:55,333
What am I to do now?

1749
02:05:55,542 --> 02:05:57,750
Better if you'd eloped with
Sundarambal last night.

1750
02:05:57,917 --> 02:06:00,667
This is what I said earlier.
Get lost!

1751
02:06:00,833 --> 02:06:04,792
Never trust a friend if he promises
to help you in your love.

1752
02:06:05,167 --> 02:06:07,667
Plan must work out well.
- Do as I say, brother-in-law.

1753
02:06:07,833 --> 02:06:08,583
Okay, brother-in-law.

1754
02:06:09,542 --> 02:06:10,125
Hubby!
- What?

1755
02:06:10,333 --> 02:06:12,542
Priest is going at 5 am for
9 to 10.30 am auspicious time.

1756
02:06:12,750 --> 02:06:14,667
He may create problems.

1757
02:06:16,667 --> 02:06:17,458
Tell me, brother.

1758
02:06:17,667 --> 02:06:20,333
Why are you going away
leaving us behind?

1759
02:06:20,542 --> 02:06:23,292
Nothing like that, I'll be in marriage hall
at right time fixed by you, brother.

1760
02:06:23,500 --> 02:06:24,750
Okay, priest.

1761
02:06:24,917 --> 02:06:25,875
It seems he'll come at right time.

1762
02:06:26,083 --> 02:06:27,083
I don't know if he comes
at right or wrong time.

1763
02:06:27,292 --> 02:06:29,875
The way he was going,
I fear he was going there only.

1764
02:06:30,083 --> 02:06:30,875
Goddess Mariatha.

1765
02:06:31,083 --> 02:06:34,708
All plans have failed!
What do to now?

1766
02:06:34,875 --> 02:06:37,708
Am I looking good?
Do you like it?

1767
02:06:37,875 --> 02:06:40,750
Come, let's marry.

1768
02:06:41,583 --> 02:06:42,750
I'm ready.

1769
02:06:43,292 --> 02:06:44,500
You look great.

1770
02:06:45,125 --> 02:06:46,750
You too look great.

1771
02:06:46,917 --> 02:06:48,708
Where's Buck?

1772
02:06:49,292 --> 02:06:51,875
He came...
- Did he come or not?

1773
02:06:52,708 --> 02:06:55,083
He came...but he's not here now.

1774
02:06:55,333 --> 02:06:57,500
What are you saying?

1775
02:06:57,875 --> 02:07:02,917
Your father's henchmen saw him,
they are after him now.

1776
02:07:03,083 --> 02:07:04,792
What about my marriage?
What happened to your plan then?

1777
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:06,667
What to do now?

1778
02:07:06,833 --> 02:07:10,250
There's only one way,
come let's marry first, Siva.

1779
02:07:10,458 --> 02:07:11,250
I'll kill you!

1780
02:07:11,458 --> 02:07:13,667
First find a way for my marriage.

1781
02:07:14,583 --> 02:07:16,167
I'm ready.

1782
02:07:19,375 --> 02:07:20,958
Bruce Lee? You?

1783
02:07:21,375 --> 02:07:25,375
Why did you come here?
- I'm Abhi's groom, right?

1784
02:07:25,583 --> 02:07:28,042
How did he come into our plan?

1785
02:07:28,250 --> 02:07:29,708
Why are you mum?

1786
02:07:29,875 --> 02:07:32,583
I woke up him mistaking for you.

1787
02:07:33,083 --> 02:07:35,500
Then, think he's me and marry him.
- Don't play, Siva.

1788
02:07:35,708 --> 02:07:38,875
I'll marry Abhi,
Siva, you marry Sundarambal, let's go.

1789
02:07:39,083 --> 02:07:40,667
No need of plan for this marriage.

1790
02:07:40,833 --> 02:07:43,125
I'm not for this game,
Abhi, you're responsible for all this.

1791
02:07:43,333 --> 02:07:45,708
You marry Bruce Lee first,
I'm going away.

1792
02:07:45,917 --> 02:07:47,250
Look, how she's talking to me.

1793
02:07:47,458 --> 02:07:50,000
Siva. I'm wearing dhoti for
the first time,

1794
02:07:50,208 --> 02:07:52,625
would dhoti come off
while following marriage rituals?

1795
02:07:52,792 --> 02:07:53,708
Good question.

1796
02:07:53,875 --> 02:07:57,417
Do one thing, take her
and have rehearsals.- Come.

1797
02:08:01,417 --> 02:08:05,000
Why taking so much time?
Why is he not picking up the call?

1798
02:08:06,833 --> 02:08:07,417
Tell me, bro.

1799
02:08:07,625 --> 02:08:10,250
We're ready.
- I'm not ready yet.

1800
02:08:10,458 --> 02:08:11,375
I'll inform after kidnap.

1801
02:08:11,583 --> 02:08:15,208
The kidnap victims mustn't
get hurt in any way.

1802
02:08:15,417 --> 02:08:19,833
Once everything is over as per your plan,
victims will reach home safely.

1803
02:08:20,042 --> 02:08:21,208
Okay.

1804
02:08:22,333 --> 02:08:24,333
Would he do as he says?

1805
02:08:24,542 --> 02:08:27,292
Don't worry, everything will be fine.

1806
02:08:28,083 --> 02:08:29,917
Where are you running, Buck?

1807
02:08:52,375 --> 02:08:53,750
Do you know how to wear dhoti?

1808
02:08:59,583 --> 02:09:01,542
Kidnapped the bride.
- Don't shout.

1809
02:09:01,750 --> 02:09:03,208
This marriage will happen,
she's not the bride.

1810
02:09:03,375 --> 02:09:05,375
Oh no, kidnapped groom also.
- Don't shout.

1811
02:09:05,583 --> 02:09:07,167
This marriage will happen,
he's not the groom.

1812
02:09:07,333 --> 02:09:08,875
You keep on chanting hymns.

1813
02:09:09,042 --> 02:09:10,333
Don't know what's going to happen?

1814
02:09:10,958 --> 02:09:12,625
Phone is ringing.

1815
02:09:14,042 --> 02:09:16,792
It's from master.
What happened, master?

1816
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:19,333
Deal over, we've kidnapped
bride and groom.

1817
02:09:19,542 --> 02:09:20,708
You can come now.

1818
02:09:21,625 --> 02:09:24,500
Let's get our children married saying
bride and groom are missing.

1819
02:09:24,708 --> 02:09:27,708
Come...get in car quickly...
- Come, brother-in-law.

1820
02:09:34,833 --> 02:09:35,500
I know.

1821
02:09:35,708 --> 02:09:37,000
Settled our old account.

1822
02:09:37,208 --> 02:09:38,708
Old account?
I didn't get you.

1823
02:09:38,917 --> 02:09:41,625
I kidnapped the Bruce Lee
whose marriage you'd fixed.

1824
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:48,333
If you kidnap the groom, how am I to face
his family if they come with warranty card?

1825
02:09:48,542 --> 02:09:52,000
That's what I'm asking you,
where's my wife?

1826
02:09:52,250 --> 02:09:55,250
You fixed my marriage in
your matrimony, right?

1827
02:09:55,500 --> 02:09:57,375
You gave 6 month warranty also, right?

1828
02:09:57,583 --> 02:09:59,500
She dumped me on our first night itself.

1829
02:09:59,708 --> 02:10:01,500
You haven't yet brought her back
as per your warranty.

1830
02:10:01,708 --> 02:10:04,958
For what you did to her,
any woman would run away.

1831
02:10:05,167 --> 02:10:06,583
What did I do?

1832
02:10:06,792 --> 02:10:08,708
Asking me, what did you do?

1833
02:10:12,375 --> 02:10:16,167
Will it get late?
- It make take long time.

1834
02:10:16,750 --> 02:10:18,875
It's an exercise to raise inner soul.

1835
02:10:19,500 --> 02:10:21,292
If I do this properly.

1836
02:10:21,500 --> 02:10:23,542
Our life will be smooth.

1837
02:10:32,833 --> 02:10:38,083
If you do yoga in bedroom on first night,
women will run away.

1838
02:10:41,042 --> 02:10:41,833
Start the car.

1839
02:10:47,875 --> 02:10:49,500
They kidnapped groom Bruce Lee.

1840
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:51,625
They're fixing Abhi's marriage with Siva.

1841
02:10:51,833 --> 02:10:53,333
We've give 6 month warranty
to Bruce Lee.

1842
02:10:53,542 --> 02:10:55,542
We must stop this marriage at any cost.

1843
02:10:55,750 --> 02:10:57,083
How to do, boss?

1844
02:10:59,083 --> 02:11:00,375
Marriage will happen only
if priest is there, right?

1845
02:11:10,458 --> 02:11:15,083
You're here to kidnap, right?
You carry on, I'll not shout.

1846
02:11:20,167 --> 02:11:22,458
Why are you kidnapping me, rogues?

1847
02:11:22,667 --> 02:11:25,208
I'm getting suffocated,
please leave me.

1848
02:11:25,417 --> 02:11:26,625
No, please...

1849
02:11:28,375 --> 02:11:29,917
Please leave me,

1850
02:11:32,208 --> 02:11:35,458
Don't know what to do now?

1851
02:11:35,833 --> 02:11:36,875
What happened?

1852
02:11:37,083 --> 02:11:39,917
You let him off the hook.
- What's it? What happened?

1853
02:11:40,208 --> 02:11:41,917
Our children are missing, brother.

1854
02:11:42,083 --> 02:11:43,583
Bruce Lee has been kidnapped.

1855
02:11:43,792 --> 02:11:47,000
Not Bruce Lee but Jacky Chan,
Abhi and Siva are missing.

1856
02:11:47,167 --> 02:11:48,583
Are Siva and Abhi missing?
- Yes.

1857
02:11:48,792 --> 02:11:50,917
Wait.
- Check.

1858
02:11:51,792 --> 02:11:53,625
Jayavelu!
- It's Mayan, brother-in-law.

1859
02:11:53,833 --> 02:11:56,583
We've kidnapped and
taking the groom to our village.

1860
02:11:56,792 --> 02:11:59,333
The revenge we couldn't take using you,
I'll get my vengeance using your son.

1861
02:11:59,542 --> 02:12:04,125
Oh God! Have they kidnapped my son?

1862
02:12:04,333 --> 02:12:05,417
Check, who it is?

1863
02:12:07,125 --> 02:12:08,125
I'm Parama here.

1864
02:12:08,333 --> 02:12:09,542
It's Parama!
- Brother!

1865
02:12:09,750 --> 02:12:11,583
We've kidnapped your daughter.

1866
02:12:12,167 --> 02:12:16,042
We'll take our revenge in village.

1867
02:12:16,625 --> 02:12:18,083
You said you'll get Bruce Lee and
Sundarambal kidnapped,

1868
02:12:18,292 --> 02:12:21,458
but have you got our
children kidnapped?

1869
02:12:21,667 --> 02:12:24,542
No need to depend on anyone.

1870
02:12:24,750 --> 02:12:26,667
I'll take care of everything myself.
Come.

1871
02:12:29,167 --> 02:12:30,750
Please come, hubby.
- Come...come...

1872
02:12:30,958 --> 02:12:34,708
I told you to protect my daughter,
you say she's missing.

1873
02:12:34,917 --> 02:12:37,667
If guests ask about bride and groom,
what am I to tell them?

1874
02:12:37,875 --> 02:12:41,958
Nothing is lost yet, if you bring sister-in-law,
we can change it as 60th marriage.

1875
02:12:42,125 --> 02:12:44,375
60th marriage?

1876
02:12:45,125 --> 02:12:46,958
How come army man is coming here?

1877
02:12:48,958 --> 02:12:51,208
Has any of my idols get
confiscated in Delhi?

1878
02:13:00,583 --> 02:13:06,208
Villain...hooligan...rogue...
I misunderstood you.

1879
02:13:06,833 --> 02:13:10,042
I realized after Siva told me.
That you're this nation's identity.

1880
02:13:10,250 --> 02:13:12,625
Me?
- Yes.

1881
02:13:14,917 --> 02:13:15,958
You?

1882
02:13:16,667 --> 02:13:17,625
It's me.

1883
02:13:17,833 --> 02:13:19,292
You didn't expect me here, right?

1884
02:13:20,500 --> 02:13:22,167
I expected this meeting.

1885
02:13:23,167 --> 02:13:26,875
The moment you planned to get my son
married to that smuggler's daughter.

1886
02:13:27,042 --> 02:13:29,458
Immediately I got alerted.

1887
02:13:29,667 --> 02:13:31,958
Who is smuggler's daughter?
- That Kasi!

1888
02:13:32,167 --> 02:13:33,958
Is he gentleman?

1889
02:13:34,167 --> 02:13:38,583
My family has been fighting for country
since many generations.

1890
02:13:38,792 --> 02:13:42,833
His family has been antique
smugglers since generations.

1891
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:47,083
That's why wherever my son,
I chased to get him.

1892
02:13:47,292 --> 02:13:49,917
You're wrong, Mr.Subhash Chandra Bose.

1893
02:13:50,083 --> 02:13:53,583
If you're patriot of this country,
Kasi is this nation's identity.

1894
02:13:53,792 --> 02:13:56,042
Nation's identity?

1895
02:13:56,250 --> 02:14:00,667
Yes, you could show your patriotism only
by naming after great leaders.

1896
02:14:00,875 --> 02:14:03,000
But Kasi's family isn’t like that.

1897
02:14:03,208 --> 02:14:06,875
Since from their forefather's time.

1898
02:14:07,042 --> 02:14:10,208
Orissa, Bengali, Maharashtra,
Marathi, Gujarati!

1899
02:14:10,417 --> 02:14:14,625
Since they married women
from different states,

1900
02:14:14,833 --> 02:14:17,833
so, his family has become
this nation's identity.

1901
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:25,000
Tell me now, isn't it pride to
make your son their son-in-law?

1902
02:14:27,333 --> 02:14:29,917
Every generation of your family
is a state.

1903
02:14:30,125 --> 02:14:32,625
Entire India is your clan.

1904
02:14:32,833 --> 02:14:36,208
That's why I said you're this
nation's identity.

1905
02:14:36,417 --> 02:14:40,875
My son is just namesake of Bhagat Singh.
But he's pure Tamil.

1906
02:14:41,042 --> 02:14:44,208
Can this Tamil become
kinsman of Indian?

1907
02:14:44,417 --> 02:14:47,583
You made me realize my greatness!

1908
02:15:16,500 --> 02:15:18,583
6 month warranty!
How will you conduct my marriage?

1909
02:15:18,792 --> 02:15:20,375
Replacement is the only option.
- Replacement?

1910
02:15:20,583 --> 02:15:22,583
I didn't do this for anyone
I'm doing exclusively for you.

1911
02:15:22,792 --> 02:15:24,000
Then, do it immediately.

1912
02:15:24,208 --> 02:15:27,667
If you rush like this, you may get girl who
never got likes for profile picture, is it okay?

1913
02:15:27,833 --> 02:15:29,250
I don't mind if she has
no profile picture at all.

1914
02:15:29,458 --> 02:15:31,375
I must get married immediately.

1915
02:15:31,667 --> 02:15:33,542
I can understand your brashness.

1916
02:15:34,667 --> 02:15:36,667
Who are you calling?

1917
02:15:39,833 --> 02:15:41,542
Is he here?

1918
02:15:45,167 --> 02:15:46,042
Come here.

1919
02:15:47,167 --> 02:15:48,667
Welcome, brother.
- Come...come...

1920
02:15:48,917 --> 02:15:52,875
You kidnapped Siva to get
him married to Abhi, right?

1921
02:15:53,083 --> 02:15:53,958
I'll hit you!

1922
02:15:54,167 --> 02:15:55,833
I want this fear, brother.

1923
02:15:56,042 --> 02:15:58,917
You were friends but acted like
enemies before us, right?

1924
02:15:59,125 --> 02:16:01,333
We did from our side,
how was our act?

1925
02:16:01,542 --> 02:16:02,125
Bloody!

1926
02:16:02,333 --> 02:16:03,542
Super brother.

1927
02:16:03,750 --> 02:16:07,208
Our dream for years is coming true!

1928
02:16:07,417 --> 02:16:10,792
Sister, Siva is responsible for this.

1929
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:12,000
Siva?

1930
02:16:13,125 --> 02:16:16,333
Are you Jayavelu's son?
Kill him!

1931
02:16:17,750 --> 02:16:21,833
If I've come to your place alone,
I'm not here to kill anyone.

1932
02:16:22,042 --> 02:16:23,458
I'm here for peace.

1933
02:16:23,667 --> 02:16:29,333
If you still think of revenge,
kill...kill grandma.

1934
02:16:29,542 --> 02:16:31,750
Kill us and have your revenge.

1935
02:16:31,958 --> 02:16:37,167
You want revenge and blood
but I've come alone here for peace.

1936
02:16:37,375 --> 02:16:41,792
My death must be an end to this enmity.

1937
02:16:41,958 --> 02:16:44,167
It mustn't become another staring point.

1938
02:16:44,375 --> 02:16:46,875
Those who want vengeance
can pick up billhook.

1939
02:16:47,083 --> 02:16:49,500
Those who don't want
can take a selfie with me.

1940
02:16:51,333 --> 02:16:53,750
I delivered dialogue forcefully,
would they change?

1941
02:16:55,583 --> 02:16:58,958
Nephew, no more enmity between us.
Take selfie, nephew.

1942
02:16:59,250 --> 02:16:59,542
Come, grandma.

1943
02:16:59,750 --> 02:17:06,458
You came alone and united two warring
families with a selfie, my dear grandson.

1944
02:17:18,875 --> 02:17:23,042
You united two families with a selfie!
You're great.

1945
02:17:23,250 --> 02:17:26,083
Whatever it may be,
we're kinsmen now.

1946
02:17:26,292 --> 02:17:31,333
What else! Let's celebrate Siva and
Abhi's marriage we wished.

1947
02:17:36,667 --> 02:17:38,042
I'm very happy.

1948
02:17:41,667 --> 02:17:44,417
What are you doing?

1949
02:17:44,625 --> 02:17:47,708
I'm elder to you by a second.
I'll tie the knot.

1950
02:17:52,208 --> 02:17:56,458
I gave him coffee after
he took blessings from uncle.

1951
02:17:56,667 --> 02:17:58,708
Should i continue serving coffee
to my son?

1952
02:17:58,917 --> 02:18:00,625
Is coffee important now?
- Please listen to me, dear.

1953
02:18:00,792 --> 02:18:02,000
Brother-in-law, hold her.

1954
02:18:02,208 --> 02:18:07,542
Hold her...hold her tightly.

1955
02:18:08,542 --> 02:18:10,167
Play music!

1956
02:18:19,500 --> 02:18:22,375
You're a lion like your father.

1957
02:18:22,792 --> 02:18:25,667
Got scared?
Just for fun, you coward!

1958
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:32,625
They're killing while having feast.
- Wait, I'll not spare you alive.

1959
02:18:32,792 --> 02:18:33,667
Run away!

1960
02:18:33,875 --> 02:18:36,417
They're killing each other for
not serving eggs in feast.

1961
02:18:36,625 --> 02:18:39,375
All over again!
