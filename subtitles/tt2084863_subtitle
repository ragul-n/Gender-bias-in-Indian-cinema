1
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:32,821
Hey, Hibiscus! How are you, friend?

2
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:37,754
Is your staple and petal
and everything fine?

3
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:44,302
Run, Keshu. - For What?

4
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:45,765
There's an exam.

5
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:50,839
Exams keep coming.
Read it when you find time.

6
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:54,402
Keshu, the scientist!
Please... please...

7
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:55,638
Put off!

8
00:01:57,383 --> 00:01:58,611
What do you want? Shall
I get the examination cancelled?

9
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:01,185
I swear, next time
I'll learn everything.

10
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:02,786
Please, Keshu.

11
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:06,282
Save me this time, please.
- Okay.

12
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:07,572
Look, I gave him three chances
considering...

13
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:12,981
...your prestige. But he's
always lost in his own world.

14
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:17,081
Like some terrorists he spread
laughing gas in the school.

15
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:18,654
Exams are cancelled
and I can't tell you...

16
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:22,216
...how I was insulted in front
of the management.

17
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:23,520
Please, sir.

18
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:27,358
Please manage this time.
- No. Impossible.

19
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:31,569
Heed me. Stop spending your hard
earned money after him.

20
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:34,231
Sir! Please, sir.
Give him one more chance.

21
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,274
I'll reason him, sir.

22
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:43,144
Sir! - No! Please spare me.

23
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:45,783
Take him away in your truck.

24
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,419
Will you always drive at
this speed?

25
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:15,696
Give!

26
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:16,996
Keshu! - Yes.

27
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:20,866
Put this big box down.
And the smaller ones above it.

28
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:22,674
Okay? - Yes, father.

29
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:24,467
Come on, hurry up.

30
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,714
Hey, bring it quickly.

31
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:35,082
Take care of the small boxes.
It has eggs.

32
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:55,798
What types of eggs are these?

33
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:17,362
What's this? - Can't you read?

34
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:24,235
E. G. G. Eggs! Warm eggs!

35
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,529
Your mother must have
laid such eggs.

36
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,001
Idiot!

37
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:49,560
"Loot and cheating take place
everywhere in the world."

38
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:52,228
"All the criminals have
becomes sages...

39
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,299
...making money."

40
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:59,003
"Buy vote and forget everything."

41
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:01,402
"How do we live like this?"

42
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:03,737
"Just chant God's name."

43
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:06,277
"Public dances
on politician's vote."

44
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:08,504
"With government's one stroke,
they'll get furious."

45
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:12,914
"Recession requests,
is there any name of love?"

46
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:15,586
"You get nothing pure today.
Also need to pay for water."

47
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:18,019
"Many are defamed in this scam."

48
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:22,356
"There's no feeling of shame
they deal the bombs."

49
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:26,998
"There's no feeling of shame
they deal the bombs."

50
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:43,839
"Listen, Keshu. Listen son."

51
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:50,590
"Listen, Keshu. Listen son."

52
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:50,954
"Listen, Keshu. Listen son."

53
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:58,388
"Listen, friend."

54
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:02,760
Father!

55
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:04,762
Now what?

56
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:09,207
I want to pee. - Have patience.

57
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:15,776
We should have crossed
this road in daylight.

58
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,881
Many wild animals wander here.

59
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:32,357
Father, just drive away!
- Keep quiet! And don't move.

60
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,771
There's gift to be delivered
at the police station.

61
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:43,971
They should receive this fiirst
in the early morning.

62
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:46,144
Understood? Come on, open the truck.

63
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:50,310
Yes, why not?
We're here for your service only.

64
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:52,410
Sometimes, goods...

65
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:54,884
...sometimes grass and now a body.

66
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:57,017
It's an ambulance for you.

67
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:01,287
Do we've to give any message
at the police station...

68
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:02,361
...or just deliver it?

69
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:06,395
Don't talk nonsense. Do as we say.
- Keshu, come down.

70
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:07,466
No!

71
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:10,535
I said come down. He's coming.

72
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:45,930
Headquarter to post 4!

73
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:48,138
Headquarter to post 4!

74
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,137
Tell us about your position.

75
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:52,403
DFO's body is coming urgently.

76
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:54,078
Token sir! Token sir!
- Tell us your position.

77
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,080
Who's it?
- There's a message. Get up!

78
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:58,542
Tell us about your position.

79
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:02,586
We're at Jhanjharpur outpost!

80
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:07,118
Urgently report at the station.
DFO's body is received.

81
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:10,851
Over! - Hey... Get up!
DFO's body is received.

82
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:15,864
Yes, sir. DFO's body? Hurry up!
- Yes.

83
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:23,905
Salutation!

84
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:31,609
Really unfortunate!

85
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:35,216
All our efforts went into vain!

86
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,149
And you, the journalists have
really given us a headache.

87
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:43,187
And Ms. Bindu, you!

88
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,357
You criticize us a lot. Right?!

89
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:48,595
Write about this now.
Police do not take any action.

90
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:49,690
Police is sitting idle.

91
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:51,733
I had put my entire force
over here.

92
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:53,737
Under your pressure,
I kept my force here.

93
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:54,897
See the results.

94
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:57,334
And these are the professional
criminals we're dealing with.

95
00:12:57,576 --> 00:12:59,009
They're not the common man, okay?

96
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:03,875
Now click the photographs and
write about it. Come on.

97
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:06,818
Come!

98
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,901
Really unfortunate.
- Sir! - What?

99
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:26,732
Let's send one troop to
the forest of Baitua!

100
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:28,236
We'll personally go.

101
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:31,705
I'm getting little hint about
who they can be.

102
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,869
Sub inspector Mahato!

103
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:36,977
Take the right decision
at right time.

104
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:42,152
Go to Peepariya!
Handle the case properly.

105
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:46,191
You may leave.

106
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,354
Sir! - Yes.

107
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:52,387
Sir!

108
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:57,224
Yes, doctor.
- S. P. Sir, she's my niece Sapna.

109
00:13:57,436 --> 00:13:58,562
Hi!

110
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:03,174
You know my sister-in-law.
She's Italian.

111
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:06,177
And she's Sapna.
She has come from America.

112
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:07,739
And wants to research here.

113
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:11,744
I'm doing research on public
cultural art for my M. Phil.

114
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,113
Great.

115
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:20,384
I want to see how people do
the art of Madhubani painting.

116
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:23,390
So, doctor. How can I help you?

117
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:26,257
She wants to visit the
far off villages. - Okay.

118
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:28,327
I explained her
the situation of this area.

119
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,264
She doesn't listen to me.
Now you reason her.

120
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:32,999
Where do you want to go?

121
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:36,207
To some villages like Sura,
Dindiya, Teetwarpur...

122
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:39,402
...Karampur, Madhial, Ranti.

123
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:41,469
It's very risky.

124
00:14:42,848 --> 00:14:45,715
Unfortunately, we also think
twice before going there.

125
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:47,212
I told her the same.

126
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,451
I would not allow my own
daughter to go there.

127
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:50,419
Never...

128
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,081
Yes, but I have to go.
With or without escort.

129
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:55,225
Well said!

130
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,661
You never get such
dedicated children...

131
00:14:57,796 --> 00:15:00,560
...and students these days. Right?

132
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:03,765
It's difficult work. But possible.

133
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:07,499
What does your father do?
- He owns an industry.

134
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:09,765
Of ball bearing. - I see.

135
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:13,867
Gift. - This is a gift for you.
- Okay.

136
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:16,413
From daddy's company.
- Thank you very much.

137
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:22,251
Okay, doctor, in our professions,
'see you again'...

138
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:24,288
...is a risky sentence.
- You are right.

139
00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:26,384
But see you again.
- Thank you very much, sir.

140
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:28,183
All the best with your project.
- Thanks.

141
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:29,552
Come on. - Just be careful!

142
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:36,200
110, 111, 112... 115... 116...

143
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:38,800
Aunt! Aunt! - Yes.

144
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:41,330
Brother Keshu came face
to face with the dacoits.

145
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:43,373
But he didn't get scared.
- Oh, really?

146
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:47,669
Brother is never afraid of anything.
- Really?

147
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:50,348
Really?!

148
00:15:55,387 --> 00:16:00,222
Good shot!
- Great! You've got owl's eyes!

149
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:05,394
Shall we leave?
- Bye! Okay, see you.

150
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:07,455
See you at the river bank
in the evening.

151
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:19,908
There comes again...
on a big screen... presenting...

152
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:31,649
Are you looking for
your brother-in-law?

153
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:52,107
No one from them. Bye!

154
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:54,841
Take them away.

155
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:59,776
When will I get it?
- Manto sir, repair this one.

156
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:01,614
Give it.

157
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:12,292
Look at that girl.
- Hey, foreigner girl.

158
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,166
Sweet girl!

159
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:26,237
Javed! Look there.
- Hello! Hey, how nice!

160
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:27,607
Yeah, I hear you.

161
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,378
How are you doing?

162
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:36,085
Lots of people I met.
But my uncle is a nervous man.

163
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:40,223
I don't know. I'm confused.

164
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:42,793
But you know,
I'm so happy. And you know...

165
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:44,486
The paintings are awesome.

166
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:48,225
Whatever you heard, like
the cards business and all about...

167
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:50,460
It's all there, you know.

168
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:54,070
You take care and miss me.
See you, bye!

169
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:15,922
Thank you for your patience,
Mr. Sharma.

170
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:17,188
Mention not, madam.

171
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,838
What happened? Do you want an
egg?

172
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:34,637
My dear!

173
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:39,479
Why did you leave me alone?

174
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:48,189
That idiot constable!
A useless fellow!

175
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:53,130
A useless fellow!

176
00:18:56,135 --> 00:19:02,335
You didn't get a single
promotion in past seven years.

177
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:15,844
What Token is this?

178
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:23,327
Daily we hear about a murder,
kidnapping and rape.

179
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:28,856
Do you have any tears left?

180
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:38,402
Aunt! Aunt!

181
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:40,708
Aunt.

182
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:44,304
Come, Keshu, you are
in English mood today.

183
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:45,844
Tell me one thing.

184
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:49,410
What love means?

185
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:54,618
This love...

186
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:59,619
How do we know we're in love?

187
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:02,865
Keshu. Which is this
new chapter now?

188
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:04,992
Aunt, please tell me if you can.

189
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:06,532
What is love?

190
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:14,244
It's a history.
A mystery. A love!

191
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:18,308
The universe has sustained
on this one word.

192
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:21,250
If not love,
the world will not sustain.

193
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:24,186
But why this commotion
in heart with just one sight?

194
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:29,226
I'm confused about it.

195
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:44,939
Where are you going?
Stop! Stop, I said

196
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:45,911
Stop! Where are you going?

197
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:49,005
Stop! Where are you going?

198
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:51,775
Where are you going?
Keeps playing all the day.

199
00:20:51,883 --> 00:20:52,975
Listen!

200
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:55,419
Spit out fiirst and then speak.

201
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,748
How can anyone understand
what you mean?

202
00:20:58,156 --> 00:20:59,350
This has become a routine now.

203
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,392
Elder son is already spoilt.

204
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:03,961
And now this younger one
is following his path.

205
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:06,391
Elder brother always guides
the young ones.

206
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:08,761
And these useless son
and his loafer friends.

207
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:10,198
What guidance will they provide?

208
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:12,633
God is the saviour now.
Wonder what will happen.

209
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:14,330
Let go off!

210
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:18,341
'Let me tell you
that your original form...

211
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:23,938
...is such splendid and beautiful
that any God and Goddess.'

212
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:25,277
Let me wash my mouth.

213
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,612
Call Sapna.

214
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,914
Madam!
- Why do you want to meet her?

215
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:03,749
Meeting!

216
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:07,824
Okay, wait a minute!

217
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,400
Hey, dear. - Yes.

218
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:24,272
How are you doing? - I'm good.

219
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:25,966
So, what brings you here?

220
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:27,569
I'm Keshu!

221
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:31,982
Have we met?
- No. We're meeting now.

222
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:33,408
Oh, I see.

223
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:36,817
I know everything about you.

224
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:40,684
Oh, really? I'm so famous already.

225
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,555
No... no... I'm famous.

226
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:48,928
I'm a big man.
I know everything.

227
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:51,328
Everything. About every man here.

228
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:55,972
If you need anything.
You can ask me. Right?

229
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,802
Thank you! But no thank you.
I've already asked...

230
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:00,343
...Mr. Sharma to be my guide.

231
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:02,647
And he's a knowledgeable teacher.

232
00:23:05,183 --> 00:23:08,209
Look, Mr. Sharam knows nothing.
- What?

233
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:09,846
What's that?

234
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:11,487
What's Mr. Sharma?

235
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:16,555
He takes Rs100 from the boys
to leak a question paper.

236
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:17,719
What?

237
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:23,033
Do you know leaking?
He leaks question papers.

238
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:25,000
He's a cheater.

239
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,762
What he knows?
What all does he know?

240
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,537
Ask me.

241
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,976
I've enquired about everything.

242
00:23:34,946 --> 00:23:37,005
About the artists,
criminals, naxals.

243
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:38,810
Naxal? - I know everybody.

244
00:23:39,117 --> 00:23:41,642
I'll guide you.
Don't take tension. No problem.

245
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:45,121
You know those mysterious men?
The naxals?

246
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:48,017
There's only one mystery
in the universe.

247
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:54,264
It's love.
- Please, stop. I don't like this.

248
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:57,395
Okay, no need of this?
- No, just... just leave.

249
00:23:57,669 --> 00:24:00,194
I want to talk in private.
- Please, leave.

250
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:02,871
I'll take you to the places.
- Please go.

251
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:04,265
To the palace, Old fort. - Go.

252
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:06,934
I'll be your guide. - Leave. Go!

253
00:24:07,045 --> 00:24:09,513
I'll show you full Bihar.
- I don't want a guide.

254
00:24:09,681 --> 00:24:11,239
I'll help you. - Go!

255
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:15,010
Who's he? - Keshu!

256
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:18,587
He helps his father on the truck.

257
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:22,923
He's different from other boys.
You saw him, right?

258
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,024
I'll come tomorrow.

259
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:32,296
Check everything. I've
got to go a long route.

260
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:35,565
The truck shouldn't stop
in the middle of the road.

261
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:39,969
Check the engine oil and
replace them if required.

262
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:45,149
And yes. Fix these bolt and
wires again. Fit them properly.

263
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:48,177
Did you hear the latest news
about your elder son?

264
00:24:48,854 --> 00:24:54,053
Yesterday he tried to woo
doctor's foreigner niece.

265
00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:07,269
Keshu, you are fiinished.

266
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:09,731
Just two moves and
your game is over.

267
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:11,739
Javed! - Yes.

268
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:14,103
Play on my behalf. - Why?

269
00:25:16,147 --> 00:25:17,808
I'm out of focus.

270
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:22,980
Strange talking! Out of focus!

271
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:27,324
Local boy and foreigner girl.

272
00:25:28,493 --> 00:25:31,121
Banto, now play your game.

273
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:34,563
There's a forest in my area.

274
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:36,723
I always get mislead over there.

275
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:37,960
Very nice!

276
00:25:38,503 --> 00:25:44,169
She passed by a train
and I shiver like a bridge.

277
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:46,334
Oh my God! I love you.

278
00:25:47,078 --> 00:25:48,136
Dramatic!

279
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:52,982
Beloved, my heart is restless.

280
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:57,081
"No one known what
my future holds."

281
00:25:57,188 --> 00:26:00,385
"Come... come..." - Papa?!

282
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:03,057
Brother, papa is coming.
He looks angry.

283
00:26:03,461 --> 00:26:10,458
Please do not torture me so much.
- Hello, uncle!

284
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,870
"Come... come..."

285
00:26:13,171 --> 00:26:15,503
You went to the doctor's house,
right?

286
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:18,974
Idiot! Tried to impress
them with your English?

287
00:26:20,011 --> 00:26:21,672
Youth is spilling over I think.

288
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:22,769
Keshu!

289
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:27,008
Keshu, stop! You!

290
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:29,085
Move.

291
00:26:31,122 --> 00:26:35,422
Idiot Keshu, he really went
to meet that foreigner girl.

292
00:26:35,894 --> 00:26:37,259
It requires courage, dear.

293
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:40,426
I love my India.

294
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:50,466
Keshu!

295
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:51,767
Keshu! Stop!

296
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:57,412
Stop! Stop! - Be careful!

297
00:27:01,252 --> 00:27:04,915
Hey, Keshu!
I won't spare you today.

298
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:12,662
Come out! Come out, I said.

299
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:15,990
Rogue! Where has he gone?

300
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:17,768
Keshu! Come out!
- What happened?

301
00:27:17,902 --> 00:27:18,926
Move away.

302
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:21,229
Why are you getting angry?

303
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:25,475
He went to the doctor to entice
his foreigner niece. - Okay.

304
00:27:25,677 --> 00:27:27,736
Sit down! Please...
- He tried to misbehave with her.

305
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:30,039
God! - I'll kill him today.

306
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:32,179
For now, you please calm down.

307
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:41,989
Shall I look after the truck
or keep watch on him?

308
00:27:42,193 --> 00:27:44,457
Okay, you please calm down.
Lie down!

309
00:27:44,562 --> 00:27:45,620
Move away.
You don't interfere today.

310
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:47,095
Yes, I'll not interfere.
- I'll kill him today.

311
00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:48,995
Okay... okay...
- I'll end this matter permanently.

312
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,465
The matter will be fiinished.
- Okay.

313
00:27:50,602 --> 00:27:51,534
Rogue!

314
00:27:51,636 --> 00:27:55,265
I worked hard...
- It's not good to be so angry.

315
00:27:56,641 --> 00:27:57,938
Rogue!
- Why are you shouting?

316
00:27:58,076 --> 00:27:59,543
He has harassed me a lot.

317
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,374
It's not good to be so angry.

318
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:44,015
Brother!

319
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:46,186
My brother is never scared
of anything.

320
00:29:04,976 --> 00:29:07,809
"My heart raced on the fiirst sight...

321
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:10,847
...second time it said..."

322
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:13,915
"My heart raced on the fiirst sight...

323
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:16,179
...second time it said..."

324
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:23,116
"Is she a fairy or a nymph?"

325
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:29,197
"Wherever I look at,
I see her everywhere around me."

326
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:32,301
"My heart raced on the fiirst sight...

327
00:29:32,403 --> 00:29:35,668
...second time it said..."

328
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:50,586
"Her eyes struck my heart."

329
00:29:50,688 --> 00:29:54,385
"I'm flying high."

330
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:02,860
"She gave me just one sight
and turned away..."

331
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:06,664
...stealing my senses
and peace of mind."

332
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:12,136
"Is she a fairy or a nymph?"

333
00:30:12,343 --> 00:30:18,441
"Wherever I look at,
I see her everywhere around me."

334
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:21,412
"Wherever I look at,
I see her everywhere around me."

335
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:24,488
"Wherever I look at,
I see her everywhere around me."

336
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:27,524
"Wherever I look at,
I see her everywhere around me."

337
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,628
"Wherever I look at,
I see her everywhere around me."

338
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:32,457
"Wherever I look at,
I see her everywhere around me."

339
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:33,894
Hello! This is doctor.

340
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:06,895
So, got the first beating? Romeo!

341
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:10,796
Going in the right direction.

342
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:18,167
Uncle, you can't.

343
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:21,572
You can't kill anyone
for singing a song.

344
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:27,350
Are you in love with him?
- What are you saying, uncle?

345
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:29,445
He's in love.

346
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,251
That loafer is in love with you.

347
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:37,955
A Bihari boy is in love.

348
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:41,824
What?
- And there can't be anything else.

349
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:48,900
That man's crazy, insane
and dangerous.

350
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:55,510
It's a big loss.

351
00:31:56,014 --> 00:31:57,606
You all were fond of
getting beaten...

352
00:31:57,715 --> 00:31:59,307
...but my phone is damaged.

353
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:00,642
Who will bear this loss?

354
00:32:02,153 --> 00:32:03,780
Enough, friend. Enough now.

355
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:05,649
That foreigner girl is guilty.

356
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:07,782
Neither would see peep
through the window...

357
00:32:07,892 --> 00:32:10,486
...neither would she smiled
nor would he or he be crying.

358
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:15,494
Neither you nor he.
- That's the only status we're in.

359
00:32:16,834 --> 00:32:19,166
Someone please make a call.
Has anyone a coin?

360
00:32:19,637 --> 00:32:21,571
Everyone is blind here.

361
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:28,110
Sir, this will cost you Rs35.
It's a best quality product.

362
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:32,511
It stands, runs on the track
and also a light blinks in this.

363
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:33,876
Yes, what do you want, sir?

364
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:35,915
This will cost you Rs.20.

365
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:39,280
This is of Rs.70.

366
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:44,660
Keshu, leave the steering. Keshu!

367
00:32:44,996 --> 00:32:47,760
Can't you hear me? - Hurry up.

368
00:32:47,865 --> 00:32:49,230
Don't you dare touch it.

369
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:53,530
Platform number 12...
instead of platform number 12...

370
00:32:53,671 --> 00:32:55,798
...it'll depart from
platform number 14.

371
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:57,272
Instead of platform number 12...

372
00:32:57,408 --> 00:32:59,467
...it'll depart from
platform number 14.

373
00:32:59,877 --> 00:33:02,004
Aarey, Vikram, Sasaram Diary.

374
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:04,341
Aarey, Vikram, Sasaram Diary.

375
00:33:05,016 --> 00:33:07,382
Come on, hurry up!

376
00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:11,420
This bus?

377
00:33:40,451 --> 00:33:42,419
Incredible.

378
00:33:57,201 --> 00:34:00,796
Mr. Sharma,
what has been shown into this?

379
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:06,634
It's a form of Goddess Kali.

380
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:14,184
Goddess Kali has
a great importance...

381
00:34:14,318 --> 00:34:15,979
...in Black magic.

382
00:34:16,921 --> 00:34:18,149
Bookish knowledge
will not help you...

383
00:34:18,256 --> 00:34:19,188
...understand this painting.

384
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:24,395
Madam, you need to feel it.

385
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:26,492
This is a lifeless body.

386
00:34:27,165 --> 00:34:29,429
A body of bones and fleshes.
That is a corpse.

387
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:30,795
Okay.

388
00:34:31,803 --> 00:34:35,295
When Goddess Kali touches it,
it becomes alive.

389
00:34:37,141 --> 00:34:39,541
Feelings beat in heart.

390
00:34:40,178 --> 00:34:41,440
You need not look for it outside...

391
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:43,740
...or read out in the books.
- I see.

392
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:47,514
When Goddess Durga murdered
Mahisasur...

393
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:50,550
You should say beheaded...

394
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:56,121
Mahisasur is nothing but
the anger, cunningness...

395
00:34:56,227 --> 00:34:57,717
...greediness and jealousy
within ourselves.

396
00:34:59,063 --> 00:35:00,758
A villain inside.

397
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:05,460
To fiight with it is very difficult.
- What?

398
00:35:06,337 --> 00:35:07,929
Diffiicult to fiight.

399
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:12,170
Whoever could fight, becomes Durga.

400
00:35:13,811 --> 00:35:15,335
And whoever is Durga is beautiful.

401
00:35:24,922 --> 00:35:27,186
How do you know so much?

402
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:36,799
Keshu!

403
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:39,695
How do you look at this?

404
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:41,529
This...

405
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:47,709
Close your eyes!

406
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:53,908
Now hand here.

407
00:36:01,459 --> 00:36:04,121
Listen to it. The rhythm
of Mahakal (Lord Shiva).

408
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:08,223
Heart beats. Shiva's drum.

409
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:17,670
"My heart beats and say,
you are very beautiful!"

410
00:36:17,775 --> 00:36:21,302
"I feel restless,
something is happening."

411
00:36:21,612 --> 00:36:25,343
"Even the moon would can't stop
looking at you." - Keshu!

412
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:27,313
"You are a nature's gift."

413
00:36:27,451 --> 00:36:28,577
Will you be my guide?

414
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:32,314
"Even the moon would can't stop
looking at you."

415
00:36:32,423 --> 00:36:34,823
"You are a nature's gift."

416
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:44,234
I'll pay you for your time.

417
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:53,137
I'll think over it.

418
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:08,614
Shall I take this?

419
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:14,028
What a big change?
Keshu and books?

420
00:37:14,665 --> 00:37:17,259
When you get a reason
of your living, even a book...

421
00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:18,995
...can work like a magnet.

422
00:37:19,203 --> 00:37:21,694
Which subject is evoking
interest in you these days?

423
00:37:22,873 --> 00:37:24,363
There's one subject, sir.

424
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:26,306
It's anonymous.

425
00:37:26,978 --> 00:37:27,967
There's no syllabus.

426
00:37:29,113 --> 00:37:31,172
There's no guide available
to it in the market.

427
00:37:32,149 --> 00:37:33,514
It's a very diffiicult subject.

428
00:37:34,552 --> 00:37:38,147
It says one who fails in this,
actually passes.

429
00:37:38,522 --> 00:37:40,513
Whoever will sink will
cross the river.

430
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:44,758
As you know
I've a record of sinking.

431
00:37:45,463 --> 00:37:47,431
So, I want to test myself.

432
00:37:48,065 --> 00:37:50,533
Which book do you want?
- English Guru!

433
00:37:50,968 --> 00:37:52,833
Hey... - He's there.

434
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:54,028
Keshu!

435
00:37:54,138 --> 00:37:55,070
Done? Let's go.

436
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:56,969
Come on! - Come on.

437
00:37:57,074 --> 00:37:59,599
So, professor, which book
did you buy? Show me.

438
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:01,006
English Guru! - Okay.

439
00:38:15,726 --> 00:38:19,457
Mr. Someshwar,
is the alignment proper?

440
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:27,466
Now get yourself into alignment.

441
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:31,501
Why? - I think you are going
to get into a trouble.

442
00:38:32,276 --> 00:38:33,436
What happened now?

443
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:35,838
Doctor was very sad yesterday.

444
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,305
With his niece's matter.

445
00:38:38,549 --> 00:38:40,346
Keshu hasn't stopped
thinking about her.

446
00:38:40,584 --> 00:38:43,075
He follows her
everywhere she goes.

447
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:50,151
I doubt he may not get
serious with it.

448
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:54,357
Better control your son.

449
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:08,706
He needs to be controlled.
Fix this in your mind.

450
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:41,043
Come on.

451
00:39:47,151 --> 00:39:49,984
I'm tired of explaining you.

452
00:39:51,088 --> 00:39:53,750
But you are not ready
to understand.

453
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,724
What happened now?
- You're asking me?

454
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:06,998
You'll keep following
that girl and ruin me.

455
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,839
Can't you understand that
we'll have to leave this place?

456
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,507
Whoa...

457
00:40:13,811 --> 00:40:17,110
Look, Keshu,
stop going after that girl.

458
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:20,041
And help me in my business.

459
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:22,510
Concentrate and work honestly.

460
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:27,417
Understood? - Father, you fold hands
at those kidnappers.

461
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:30,259
Bribe the constables
on every crossroad.

462
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:32,920
You deliver bombs and guns
in your truck.

463
00:40:34,131 --> 00:40:36,691
And running this truck
on bogus papers.

464
00:40:36,901 --> 00:40:38,129
That's really a honest work.

465
00:40:38,335 --> 00:40:39,666
Great, son.

466
00:40:40,037 --> 00:40:41,971
Will you teach me English now?

467
00:40:42,573 --> 00:40:44,871
You son of a fool! Absent minded.

468
00:40:45,409 --> 00:40:47,673
This is what people talk about you.

469
00:40:48,412 --> 00:40:49,902
Look at your dressing styles.

470
00:40:50,214 --> 00:40:53,945
Do you look like a man? Actor!

471
00:40:54,251 --> 00:40:55,411
Will you teach me?

472
00:40:56,153 --> 00:40:57,381
You!

473
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,391
You've yet not experienced life,
that's why...

474
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:02,982
...you live in dream world.

475
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:06,119
Come to the ground and
you'll understand everything.

476
00:41:06,263 --> 00:41:07,389
Fool!

477
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:14,737
I'm tired of explaining you
but you...

478
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:24,240
When I say something,
you must hear me.

479
00:41:32,389 --> 00:41:34,084
I heard you removed Mr. Sharma.

480
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:36,289
Yeah, uncle.

481
00:41:36,594 --> 00:41:39,620
Mr. Sharma is boring and bookish.

482
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,525
He's very dry, you know.

483
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:45,461
I've called Keshu.
He talks very differently.

484
00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:48,638
His understanding is very deep,
you know?

485
00:41:48,772 --> 00:41:50,399
I'm going to learn a lot
in his company.

486
00:41:50,574 --> 00:41:53,168
Don't you dare meet him again.

487
00:41:53,744 --> 00:41:55,507
You need not meet that loafer,
did you get that?

488
00:41:56,146 --> 00:41:59,309
But why?
He's a good friend of mine.

489
00:42:00,417 --> 00:42:02,385
I'm sorry but
I don't agree with this.

490
00:42:04,722 --> 00:42:07,088
This isn't your America. Mind it.

491
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:33,140
What happened?

492
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:35,579
Why does your face looks serious?

493
00:43:36,747 --> 00:43:39,682
Boss, it's time now. - What time?

494
00:43:39,817 --> 00:43:40,977
Now go and tell her.

495
00:43:41,085 --> 00:43:44,577
What do I say and to whom?
- To her. Who else?

496
00:43:44,855 --> 00:43:46,220
Look, don't behave innocent.

497
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:48,455
This is a right time
and right occasion.

498
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:51,154
Confess your love.

499
00:43:52,496 --> 00:43:54,191
Are you out of your mind?

500
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:56,523
Suggesting me to confess.

501
00:43:58,402 --> 00:44:00,131
Have you met the doctor?

502
00:44:00,938 --> 00:44:02,929
I'm sure you forgot
the beating you had last time.

503
00:44:05,175 --> 00:44:09,339
This time my insane father
will really kill me.

504
00:44:09,713 --> 00:44:14,912
Fine, we'll die. We're not
afraid of the death. What's say?

505
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:21,716
Death is sure to come.
Why should we crush our dreams?

506
00:44:40,944 --> 00:44:43,105
Fine, pals. Done! .

507
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:47,777
That's the spirit!
Yes. I love my India.

508
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:50,843
Yes!

509
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:01,692
Hey, dear...

510
00:45:07,504 --> 00:45:08,596
I love...

511
00:45:09,273 --> 00:45:10,763
I love...

512
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:13,842
I love...

513
00:45:16,113 --> 00:45:17,546
I love you.

514
00:45:21,418 --> 00:45:23,045
I love...

515
00:45:25,322 --> 00:45:26,584
Good night!

516
00:46:04,328 --> 00:46:05,454
Keshu?!

517
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:08,359
Call Sapna!

518
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:11,693
I'll see!

519
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:59,445
Hey, Keshu, Hi! Nice to see you!

520
00:47:00,517 --> 00:47:02,382
Mike, this is Keshu.

521
00:47:03,854 --> 00:47:06,448
What an eye he has, you know.

522
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:11,055
And without him my work would be
no where.

523
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:18,297
Keshu, he's Mike. My boyfriend.

524
00:47:18,735 --> 00:47:19,724
Hi!

525
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:25,903
Nice to meet you!

526
00:47:31,448 --> 00:47:36,147
I'll go now. I've some work.
- What's the hurry?

527
00:47:44,328 --> 00:47:45,295
Hey...

528
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:52,631
Keshu! - Keshu! What happened?

529
00:47:54,738 --> 00:47:56,228
Why didn't you gift her this?

530
00:47:59,276 --> 00:48:01,176
Hey... - Keshu!

531
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:02,435
What happened?

532
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:28,163
Give me some rest.

533
00:48:29,706 --> 00:48:33,767
Even after the drink
I'm not getting the kick.

534
00:48:34,211 --> 00:48:36,475
Finished the entire bottle.

535
00:48:44,354 --> 00:48:45,821
Lowly!

536
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:30,497
Token!

537
00:50:05,469 --> 00:50:10,338
"I'm heading on a path all alone."

538
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:15,273
"Without any destination,
on the aimless paths."

539
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:20,616
"I'm heading on a path all alone."

540
00:50:20,884 --> 00:50:25,480
"Without any companion,
even the paths are silent."

541
00:50:25,989 --> 00:50:35,022
"May the paths be never ending."

542
00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:43,639
"May I never get a stop."

543
00:50:51,982 --> 00:50:56,715
"Like the lightening that
struck through the clouds...

544
00:50:56,820 --> 00:51:01,780
...my beloved strikes in my memory."

545
00:51:02,092 --> 00:51:07,052
"It pierces my heart."

546
00:51:07,264 --> 00:51:12,292
"Your appealing look gives
a sweet pain in my heart."

547
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:22,843
"Running after the moon."

548
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:32,378
"Thought false
but this is my story."

549
00:51:37,727 --> 00:51:43,063
"My tears have dried up."

550
00:51:43,166 --> 00:51:47,728
"My dreams shattered
every moment."

551
00:51:48,338 --> 00:51:53,105
"Where's that small dream
I had nourished."

552
00:51:53,210 --> 00:52:02,846
"The heart is a betrayer."

553
00:52:03,253 --> 00:52:08,190
"I'm heading on a path all alone."

554
00:52:08,492 --> 00:52:13,191
"Without any companion,
even the paths are silent."

555
00:52:13,396 --> 00:52:23,397
"May the paths be never ending."

556
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:33,006
"May I never get a stop."

557
00:52:44,427 --> 00:52:54,132
"My mind runs ahead
of my thoughts."

558
00:52:57,174 --> 00:52:58,163
Hello!

559
00:52:58,675 --> 00:53:01,007
Red car has left. Exactly at 10:15.

560
00:53:39,649 --> 00:53:40,445
Hey...

561
00:53:40,684 --> 00:53:41,651
Wow!

562
00:53:43,353 --> 00:53:45,378
Sapna? - Sapna?!

563
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:51,254
Hi! Hi!

564
00:53:54,831 --> 00:53:57,698
Hi! So what's up?
- After so many days?

565
00:53:57,801 --> 00:54:01,066
Yeah! I was busy with a friend.
Where's Keshu?

566
00:54:01,171 --> 00:54:04,834
Keshu! - There...

567
00:54:06,142 --> 00:54:08,201
Hey... - He went there.

568
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:12,215
Keshu!

569
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:37,596
Keshu!

570
00:54:38,475 --> 00:54:39,533
Keshu!

571
00:54:45,048 --> 00:54:46,174
Keshu!

572
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:47,973
Keshu! Wait!

573
00:54:58,395 --> 00:54:59,987
Hey... No! No!

574
00:55:08,938 --> 00:55:12,635
Hey! Stop the car! Stop!

575
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:18,072
A girl has been kidnapped...

576
00:55:18,214 --> 00:55:20,307
...from the main market yesterday.

577
00:55:21,384 --> 00:55:22,442
Did you see?

578
00:55:23,186 --> 00:55:24,778
Did you see, mister? Did you?

579
00:55:25,088 --> 00:55:26,316
No one would have seen!

580
00:55:26,956 --> 00:55:29,288
It didn't happen at midnight.

581
00:55:29,793 --> 00:55:32,819
Such a big incidence
happened in broad daylight...

582
00:55:32,962 --> 00:55:34,122
...and no one has seen it.

583
00:55:34,964 --> 00:55:38,161
Get me one eye witness
and then see what we do.

584
00:55:38,735 --> 00:55:41,169
I'll arrest the entire gang
in a week.

585
00:55:41,271 --> 00:55:42,465
We heard a lot, sir.

586
00:55:42,806 --> 00:55:44,797
How long will you boast
about the same thing?

587
00:55:45,075 --> 00:55:47,134
Look, earlier daily 6 kidnapping...

588
00:55:47,277 --> 00:55:49,302
...used to take place
in this state. 6...

589
00:55:49,546 --> 00:55:51,275
And today the number is one.

590
00:55:51,781 --> 00:55:53,578
At least give the credit
where its required.

591
00:55:54,384 --> 00:55:56,545
I agree, this case
is really unfortunate.

592
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:58,717
A talented girl has been
kidnapped.

593
00:55:59,289 --> 00:56:04,386
But... but have faith.
We're trying our best to recover it.

594
00:56:05,061 --> 00:56:06,153
Now tell me.

595
00:56:07,063 --> 00:56:09,725
Why did she came from
a far off country for a research?

596
00:56:10,633 --> 00:56:12,328
What was she researching about?

597
00:56:12,569 --> 00:56:15,003
It's one's own business,
Mr. Token.

598
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:17,203
The girl is a foreigner.

599
00:56:18,241 --> 00:56:21,301
When they're targeted
they empower us.

600
00:56:21,511 --> 00:56:23,479
Leave him, sir.
- We'll get the orders from seniors.

601
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:25,377
Go and arrest few people
for the identifiication.

602
00:56:25,482 --> 00:56:27,040
He's not at fault, sir.
Please leave him.

603
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:29,880
We've got no other job. - Yes.

604
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:41,726
Get lost!

605
00:56:41,831 --> 00:56:43,924
It's just a useless time pass game.
- Come!

606
00:56:45,301 --> 00:56:47,201
Are you looking for
your brother-in-law?

607
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:50,535
I'll break your bones.

608
00:56:52,208 --> 00:56:53,072
Get lost.

609
00:56:53,176 --> 00:56:55,736
Idiot! - This is just a drama.

610
00:56:58,782 --> 00:57:01,910
Keep an eye on your son. - Why?

611
00:57:02,285 --> 00:57:05,311
Keshu!
- I've nothing to do with anyone.

612
00:57:06,189 --> 00:57:07,417
The incidence happened in front
of him and he says...

613
00:57:07,524 --> 00:57:09,014
...he doesn't remember a face.

614
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:11,159
Everyone were in a mask. - Keshu!

615
00:57:12,162 --> 00:57:14,289
He will be called for an inquiry.
- Yes. Okay.

616
00:57:14,497 --> 00:57:16,431
Girl's uncle says he was
too friendly with her.

617
00:57:16,633 --> 00:57:18,032
Friendly? Put off! - Keep quiet.

618
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:19,257
You go. Go away.

619
00:57:20,236 --> 00:57:22,329
Sir. Sir,
don't be so furious with him.

620
00:57:22,572 --> 00:57:24,870
He may blabber anything.
You don't know him.

621
00:57:25,074 --> 00:57:28,009
The case has become serious.
SP is pressuring us.

622
00:57:28,178 --> 00:57:29,110
What do you expect us to do?

623
00:57:29,245 --> 00:57:30,303
Yes. - Let them go.

624
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:31,937
Okay. Keshu!

625
00:57:35,185 --> 00:57:36,914
Spoiled my mind.

626
00:57:40,323 --> 00:57:42,223
Police will not be
able to do anything.

627
00:57:42,892 --> 00:57:45,918
Can't you see
I'm completely helpless here?

628
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:51,257
I'm doing... everything that I can.

629
00:57:51,901 --> 00:57:54,870
They kidnapped her from the market.

630
00:57:55,605 --> 00:57:57,163
We must start investigations
on ourselves.

631
00:57:57,307 --> 00:57:58,103
What's say, Keshu?

632
00:57:58,208 --> 00:58:00,836
Of course.
We roam around the streets...

633
00:58:00,944 --> 00:58:02,309
...and lanes of the villages.

634
00:58:02,745 --> 00:58:05,771
When police gets tired,
they come to ask us.

635
00:58:06,516 --> 00:58:08,609
And look at Keshu,
sitting dejected.

636
00:58:08,751 --> 00:58:09,775
What difference does it make?

637
00:58:09,953 --> 00:58:13,252
Keshu, I need your help.
Do something.

638
00:58:13,723 --> 00:58:17,454
Brother, look for Sapna.
- Keshu is dead.

639
00:58:18,528 --> 00:58:21,725
He's fiinished off. Off!

640
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:28,062
Such anger?
This thing is common in life.

641
00:58:28,471 --> 00:58:30,132
Who are you taking revenge with?
- Look at him.

642
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:31,741
Keshu!
- Why are you after me?

643
00:58:31,741 --> 00:58:32,002
Keshu!
- Why are you after me?

644
00:58:32,275 --> 00:58:33,367
What's she to me?

645
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:39,281
She has a father,
an uncle and this boyfriend.

646
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:41,381
Her America is there.
They'll save her.

647
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:26,294
Hey, keshu wait!

648
00:59:27,430 --> 00:59:30,627
Keshu! Keshu!

649
00:59:32,101 --> 00:59:36,231
No... Stop!

650
01:00:08,338 --> 01:00:11,330
Token! - Who's it?

651
01:00:12,008 --> 01:00:12,997
Token!

652
01:00:13,977 --> 01:00:15,968
Come on, we're going
to look for that girl.

653
01:00:19,749 --> 01:00:23,651
So, go! Why do you tell me?
Good luck.

654
01:00:23,953 --> 01:00:26,046
Now that I need you,
will you be pricy?

655
01:00:30,426 --> 01:00:33,589
Constable, we came to seek
your help.

656
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:36,026
Get away! Help!

657
01:00:36,199 --> 01:00:38,690
Go and seek the help from
the police station.

658
01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:40,530
Understood? I'm not on duty.

659
01:00:40,770 --> 01:00:43,204
You all stay out.
You've to help us.

660
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:45,005
We've got no roads to go.

661
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:48,341
Have some pity on girl's condition.

662
01:00:52,148 --> 01:00:54,844
Whatever is she destined for,
will happen in her life.

663
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:57,878
Will we be able to change that?

664
01:00:59,589 --> 01:01:01,557
We're doing everything
that's possible for us.

665
01:01:02,191 --> 01:01:04,716
Now you please leave me
alone and go.

666
01:01:05,061 --> 01:01:07,188
Token, destiny isn't made
on itself.

667
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:10,595
Even the lines on your palm
can change.

668
01:01:11,467 --> 01:01:13,264
You've got this chance.
Do something.

669
01:01:17,206 --> 01:01:21,006
You daily cry for your girlfriend.

670
01:01:22,145 --> 01:01:24,136
Is this your destiny?
Think over it.

671
01:01:24,447 --> 01:01:26,176
We don't have time to think.
Let's go.

672
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:36,014
Everyone has lost it.

673
01:01:42,231 --> 01:01:44,631
What do I do? Tell me.

674
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:51,298
I'm a constable from past
many years.

675
01:01:51,607 --> 01:01:52,699
Understood?

676
01:01:53,109 --> 01:01:56,272
I can't do anything until
I receive orders from SP.

677
01:01:56,612 --> 01:02:00,844
Who am I? - Token!

678
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:08,147
You weren't like this when
you newly joined the force.

679
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:12,787
It's a question of girl's life.

680
01:02:13,830 --> 01:02:15,354
These boys need you.

681
01:02:17,467 --> 01:02:19,162
Don't think about SP.

682
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:23,698
Stop drinking and give some
meaning to your life.

683
01:02:23,973 --> 01:02:25,099
You are right.

684
01:02:39,355 --> 01:02:41,482
I think you are right, Gulabo.

685
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:47,452
Fine, tell me
what do you want me to do?

686
01:02:49,398 --> 01:02:50,626
I've got a hint.

687
01:02:57,106 --> 01:03:01,702
He has a tattoo on his cheek...

688
01:03:01,911 --> 01:03:04,880
...and he keeps
whistling all the time.

689
01:03:05,548 --> 01:03:06,412
Like this...

690
01:03:12,655 --> 01:03:14,282
Then we'll fiind him.

691
01:03:14,557 --> 01:03:17,651
Will he personally come and
tell you to recognize him?

692
01:03:17,894 --> 01:03:19,293
She's right. We must look for him.

693
01:03:19,395 --> 01:03:21,522
Yes, we'll search
the entire district.

694
01:03:22,598 --> 01:03:25,066
Right from the Jaynagar forest
to the Badhiatal...

695
01:03:25,168 --> 01:03:28,331
...every garden, market, brothel.

696
01:03:28,437 --> 01:03:29,836
But what can we four do?

697
01:03:30,039 --> 01:03:33,406
Why not? We just need
to gather a battalion.

698
01:03:33,509 --> 01:03:35,101
You are right, Keshu.
Gather everyone.

699
01:03:35,344 --> 01:03:37,278
Go, I love my India.

700
01:03:37,547 --> 01:03:41,950
Everyone look at this photo.
She's a foreigner. Our friend.

701
01:03:42,051 --> 01:03:44,042
A foreigner girl is kidnapped.

702
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:47,683
Police is just doing a drama of
enquiry, but they have no clue.

703
01:03:47,857 --> 01:03:49,381
She was a guest here.

704
01:03:50,393 --> 01:03:52,486
Same thing will happen
with our girls too.

705
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:54,926
And we'll not like
to read such news.

706
01:03:59,535 --> 01:04:01,059
Come on, we've to travel
a long distance. Come on.

707
01:04:08,544 --> 01:04:13,277
Explain the sir, it's a nice movie.
Are you getting me?

708
01:04:16,252 --> 01:04:17,514
Vegetables!

709
01:04:18,988 --> 01:04:21,047
Any news?
- Yes, I went there.

710
01:04:21,157 --> 01:04:22,249
What happened?
But there was no one.

711
01:04:22,358 --> 01:04:23,586
We're not getting any hint.

712
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:27,191
What's did he say?
- There's no clue.

713
01:04:29,732 --> 01:04:31,222
When will you let me go?

714
01:04:37,807 --> 01:04:39,069
Very simple.

715
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:41,935
When the money comes,
you'll be released.

716
01:04:52,288 --> 01:04:55,121
We've made some arrests.
The investigation is on.

717
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:35,753
Token sir! - Yes, tell me.

718
01:05:35,898 --> 01:05:38,264
Sir, just now a man came.
He bought 6 newspapers...

719
01:05:38,367 --> 01:05:39,425
...from me.

720
01:05:39,635 --> 01:05:41,603
And went to the jungle through
Sherghati crossings.

721
01:05:41,837 --> 01:05:45,637
Must be 25 years old. There's no
house or a village that side.

722
01:05:45,908 --> 01:05:46,806
Fine, do one thing.

723
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:48,604
Do not tell this to anyone
until I call you.

724
01:05:48,711 --> 01:05:50,679
You shouldn't lack
in your preparations.

725
01:05:52,048 --> 01:05:53,345
Go fully equipped.

726
01:05:55,451 --> 01:05:57,851
But do not do anything
that they'd kill the girl.

727
01:05:58,521 --> 01:05:59,749
Remember this.

728
01:06:03,326 --> 01:06:04,987
And inform me about
each of your step.

729
01:06:13,903 --> 01:06:17,361
We reached but
the destination moved.

730
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,335
We just missed it.

731
01:06:19,442 --> 01:06:21,740
They escaped, sir.

732
01:06:22,678 --> 01:06:25,340
Good, they are not hiding.

733
01:06:25,614 --> 01:06:27,980
It'll be easier for us
to catch them when they're running.

734
01:06:32,188 --> 01:06:33,246
Mike,

735
01:06:36,392 --> 01:06:38,121
You know what
the word 'Sapna' means?

736
01:06:41,497 --> 01:06:44,660
She told me once.
It means a dream.

737
01:06:46,068 --> 01:06:48,263
Yes, dream.

738
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:52,706
Life is only dream. An illusion.

739
01:06:53,709 --> 01:06:58,408
Look, she's in trouble.
It's not illusion. That's a real.

740
01:06:58,781 --> 01:07:00,305
We've to fiind her.

741
01:07:00,883 --> 01:07:04,478
It must be real for you.
For me, it's a dream.

742
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:06,447
I'm innocent, sir.

743
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:09,389
I was just her guide.

744
01:07:10,092 --> 01:07:12,390
I never said you knew her.

745
01:07:13,362 --> 01:07:15,387
But I know everything.

746
01:07:16,966 --> 01:07:20,231
Look, till now
I'm talking to you softly.

747
01:07:21,170 --> 01:07:24,469
But if you wouldn't agree,
I'll peel off your skin.

748
01:07:25,741 --> 01:07:28,801
Really, sir. I know nothing.

749
01:07:33,582 --> 01:07:35,914
Did you avenge for losing your job?

750
01:07:37,186 --> 01:07:41,816
Tell me. - I really don't know
anything, sir. - Really?

751
01:07:43,793 --> 01:07:46,159
Unfortunately,
it's a very critical matter.

752
01:07:48,164 --> 01:07:53,534
I fear if I tighten it more
they might harm the girl.

753
01:07:54,637 --> 01:07:57,003
Same thing happened in case of DFO.

754
01:07:58,374 --> 01:07:59,807
But you have patience.

755
01:08:00,276 --> 01:08:03,143
I'm personally supervising
this matter.

756
01:08:03,979 --> 01:08:06,948
By God's willing,
she'll return home safe.

757
01:08:09,218 --> 01:08:10,947
It's a matter of a girl, SP.

758
01:08:13,055 --> 01:08:15,285
It'd be better if it's solved
as early as possible.

759
01:08:17,193 --> 01:08:19,320
Brother is under state of shock.

760
01:08:21,230 --> 01:08:23,164
He's hospitalized in Houston.

761
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:27,364
Money is not a problem.
- No doubt.

762
01:08:28,771 --> 01:08:31,069
But we must think of
all the aspects, right?

763
01:08:32,575 --> 01:08:36,671
It's a question of
your niece's daughter.

764
01:08:38,714 --> 01:08:40,341
By the way, what's their demand?

765
01:08:42,985 --> 01:08:44,247
1.5 crore.

766
01:08:47,156 --> 01:08:48,783
Really unfortunate.

767
01:08:50,626 --> 01:08:52,150
Where can they hide her?

768
01:08:53,562 --> 01:08:55,154
Her American styles.

769
01:08:57,066 --> 01:09:00,035
Wherever she'll go, she'll be
identifiied even in the crowd.

770
01:09:00,803 --> 01:09:02,236
Yes, but the kidnappers
would try to take her...

771
01:09:02,338 --> 01:09:05,671
...to the place where
there are more foreigners.

772
01:09:07,576 --> 01:09:12,536
There's only one such place
in Bihar. Bodhgaya!

773
01:09:12,882 --> 01:09:16,613
Yes! We didn't think about it.

774
01:09:20,489 --> 01:09:21,649
Now?

775
01:09:22,625 --> 01:09:23,592
Bodhgaya!

776
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:44,076
There... - Did you get some news?
- There... there...

777
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:49,675
Temple... no here.
Go there. Okay? - Okay.

778
01:10:00,963 --> 01:10:03,261
Mike! - What?

779
01:10:03,933 --> 01:10:05,195
Do you love Sapna?

780
01:10:07,203 --> 01:10:08,397
I guess so.

781
01:10:08,904 --> 01:10:11,805
No guess work. Yes or no? - Yes.

782
01:10:15,878 --> 01:10:17,038
Does she love you?

783
01:10:44,673 --> 01:10:45,970
Mike!

784
01:10:46,875 --> 01:10:48,035
Mike!

785
01:10:51,947 --> 01:10:54,609
What? - Does she love you?

786
01:10:58,554 --> 01:11:02,718
Look! I don't know, man.

787
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:05,490
I can say I love her.

788
01:11:05,594 --> 01:11:08,222
No... no... no... does she love you?

789
01:11:09,531 --> 01:11:12,728
I don't know. - You know...
you are use... You are useless.

790
01:11:13,369 --> 01:11:14,859
Go back. - Keshu!

791
01:11:14,970 --> 01:11:16,835
Unnecessarily, taking a space
in the rickshaw. - Keshu.

792
01:11:16,939 --> 01:11:19,271
Doesn't even know Hindi.
He doesn't know the places.

793
01:11:19,508 --> 01:11:21,999
Just making a sad face...
Have I eloped with the girl?

794
01:11:22,211 --> 01:11:24,873
Hey, you go back.
Go back to America. Go. - Shut up!

795
01:11:25,414 --> 01:11:26,381
Let me sleep.

796
01:12:38,887 --> 01:12:39,945
Keshu!

797
01:12:42,091 --> 01:12:42,989
Yes.

798
01:12:45,394 --> 01:12:46,691
I don't think we will be
able to do it.

799
01:12:52,134 --> 01:12:54,967
Police, goons, money!
They've everything.

800
01:12:57,005 --> 01:12:58,336
Not possible.

801
01:12:59,975 --> 01:13:01,533
What's our status in front of them?

802
01:13:10,119 --> 01:13:12,019
Can't see any way out!

803
01:13:12,755 --> 01:13:14,222
You are on the way.

804
01:14:19,955 --> 01:14:22,924
Salim, follow him.
This is that whistle tune.

805
01:14:24,226 --> 01:14:25,386
This is that whistle tune.
Follow him.

806
01:14:40,242 --> 01:14:41,334
Can you tell me...

807
01:15:07,202 --> 01:15:08,066
Hello!

808
01:15:12,841 --> 01:15:14,604
Give me some whisky please.
- Yes, sir.

809
01:15:16,211 --> 01:15:17,303
Thank you very much.

810
01:15:23,318 --> 01:15:24,683
Come, sir.

811
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:28,380
How are you?
- Fine. Thank you.

812
01:15:31,193 --> 01:15:35,459
Fortunately, this time we both
have got a big lottery.

813
01:15:40,002 --> 01:15:43,335
Excuse me. Your drink sir.
- Thank you.

814
01:15:44,206 --> 01:15:45,673
Waiter! - Yes, sir.

815
01:15:45,908 --> 01:15:47,170
Some more ice please.

816
01:15:55,517 --> 01:15:58,145
"Everyone will get shocked.
The enthusiasm is such."

817
01:15:58,253 --> 01:15:59,982
"Take the pleasure of life."

818
01:16:01,123 --> 01:16:03,853
"Enjoy the pegs.
This moment will never come again."

819
01:16:03,959 --> 01:16:06,223
"Evoke my desires again. Come..."

820
01:16:41,229 --> 01:16:44,027
Somehow, I should pass this time.

821
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:48,363
I swear, next time
I'll learn everything.

822
01:16:48,637 --> 01:16:49,695
Keshu!

823
01:16:51,773 --> 01:16:55,334
"My heart is experiencing
commotion."

824
01:16:55,477 --> 01:16:57,240
That man sitting on a table
behind me in black shirt...

825
01:16:57,346 --> 01:16:59,075
...I want a key to his room.

826
01:16:59,481 --> 01:17:00,880
I'll explain you everything later.

827
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:04,643
Thank you, sir.

828
01:17:04,753 --> 01:17:05,777
"Beauty bends at heart.
Lips get sealed."

829
01:17:05,921 --> 01:17:09,288
"Love will demand sacrifiices
from you."

830
01:17:15,764 --> 01:17:17,322
Thank you... thank you, sir.
- Okay.

831
01:17:18,133 --> 01:17:19,122
The work is done.

832
01:17:31,179 --> 01:17:33,875
"I feel restless all the time.
What passion is this?"

833
01:17:34,016 --> 01:17:37,645
"Desires are unfulfilled,
thirst unquenched."

834
01:17:39,621 --> 01:17:41,248
Why will you not allow me to go?

835
01:17:41,356 --> 01:17:42,550
My son is here.

836
01:17:44,693 --> 01:17:46,820
"Desires are unfulfilled,
thirst unquenched."

837
01:17:46,928 --> 01:17:49,226
Let go off! Come on.

838
01:17:49,698 --> 01:17:53,134
"What a deceit!"
- I think we should leave.

839
01:17:53,268 --> 01:17:54,895
"Let's do this innocence!"
- Come with me.

840
01:17:55,003 --> 01:17:56,027
"It's a romantic evening."

841
01:17:56,138 --> 01:17:58,265
Hurry up! Come on!

842
01:18:09,518 --> 01:18:10,507
"Idiot!"

843
01:18:19,961 --> 01:18:21,019
What's love?

844
01:18:21,263 --> 01:18:22,389
What's love?

845
01:18:22,731 --> 01:18:25,859
I can't explain it to you.
It's concept.

846
01:18:26,768 --> 01:18:28,030
A chemistry between people.

847
01:18:28,270 --> 01:18:30,363
No chemistry,
physics or biology.

848
01:18:31,073 --> 01:18:32,199
Its magic.

849
01:18:32,674 --> 01:18:36,838
When she's with me,
people doubt me and I feel happy.

850
01:18:36,978 --> 01:18:39,071
So, then you know what it is.

851
01:18:39,614 --> 01:18:41,445
You've that magic.

852
01:18:42,884 --> 01:18:43,976
I want it.

853
01:18:44,553 --> 01:18:47,113
Always! I want it again and again.

854
01:18:47,789 --> 01:18:52,522
Keshu, calm down! Cool down!

855
01:18:53,562 --> 01:18:55,291
I'm influenced by her love.

856
01:19:25,227 --> 01:19:26,489
Keshu!

857
01:19:30,198 --> 01:19:31,324
Keep the gun down.

858
01:19:31,633 --> 01:19:33,191
Or else I'll shoot her.

859
01:19:47,549 --> 01:19:48,675
Madho! Hit!

860
01:19:50,018 --> 01:19:52,782
Beat up that idiot!
Everyone, Come on.

861
01:19:55,157 --> 01:19:58,615
What do you think of yourself?!

862
01:20:09,437 --> 01:20:12,133
I love you so much. - Mike!

863
01:20:12,774 --> 01:20:13,866
Sapna!

864
01:20:21,283 --> 01:20:24,548
I love you, too. - Keshu?!

865
01:20:41,102 --> 01:20:43,935
Hello! - We've shaken up
the entire Bodhgaya.

866
01:20:44,072 --> 01:20:46,939
Who's this? - Who else
other than Token, sir?

867
01:20:47,242 --> 01:20:48,869
Token? Where are you?

868
01:20:49,110 --> 01:20:51,169
You are my soul and
I'm your shadow, sir.

869
01:20:51,413 --> 01:20:54,177
I'm with you. - Token?!
What nonsense is this?

870
01:20:54,316 --> 01:20:55,214
Where are you?

871
01:20:55,383 --> 01:21:00,946
It's not nonsense, sir. I'm
your shadow, following you always.

872
01:21:01,223 --> 01:21:02,212
But where?

873
01:21:02,424 --> 01:21:07,726
In your car's bonnet.
Now take me out. I'm thirsty.

874
01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:10,156
Driver, stop the car.

875
01:21:11,032 --> 01:21:12,158
Stop the car.

876
01:21:16,771 --> 01:21:18,102
Gosh!

877
01:21:21,443 --> 01:21:22,774
Salutation, sir. - Get out!

878
01:21:23,211 --> 01:21:25,645
No... no violence, sir. - Out!

879
01:21:25,814 --> 01:21:28,510
The police force is coming
to welcome you.

880
01:21:31,086 --> 01:21:33,953
Don't take tension, sir.
Give this to me.

881
01:21:34,589 --> 01:21:36,386
You are transferred now.

882
01:21:36,591 --> 01:21:38,525
Gautam Buddh has said
that one should solve...

883
01:21:38,660 --> 01:21:41,026
...the matter friendly
and not violently.

884
01:21:41,129 --> 01:21:42,187
Shall we make a move?

885
01:21:47,135 --> 01:21:48,898
Salutation, sir.

886
01:21:50,372 --> 01:21:52,067
Come, sir.

887
01:21:52,307 --> 01:21:57,210
And take him away carefully.
He was our sir. - Fine.

888
01:21:57,312 --> 01:21:58,540
Take a good picture.

889
01:21:58,813 --> 01:22:01,873
I don't believe this.
- How are you? - Token!

890
01:22:02,550 --> 01:22:05,246
Keshu, we won! - Yes.

891
01:22:14,462 --> 01:22:15,724
Keshu! - Yes.

892
01:22:21,036 --> 01:22:22,162
Son!

893
01:22:27,709 --> 01:22:28,676
Let's go, father.

894
01:22:36,551 --> 01:22:37,745
Take this.

895
01:22:46,661 --> 01:22:47,855
Go!

896
01:22:49,164 --> 01:22:51,064
Salim, Mansoor, Javed!

897
01:22:51,333 --> 01:22:52,823
Coming!

898
01:23:34,042 --> 01:23:35,339
I love my India!

899
01:23:37,379 --> 01:23:40,746
"My heart beats and say,
you are very beautiful!"

900
01:23:40,882 --> 01:23:44,340
"I feel restless,
something is happening."

901
01:23:44,552 --> 01:23:47,919
"Even the moon would can't
stop looking at you."

902
01:23:48,023 --> 01:23:51,049
"You are a nature's gift."

903
01:23:51,426 --> 01:23:54,725
"Even the moon would can't stop
looking at you."

904
01:23:54,829 --> 01:23:58,321
"You are a nature's gift."

905
01:24:08,276 --> 01:24:15,045
"Paint my world,
paint it all on you."

906
01:24:15,383 --> 01:24:21,845
"Break the...
I've been looking through."

907
01:24:22,123 --> 01:24:25,388
"But Now I am awake,
shaking to my core."

908
01:24:25,527 --> 01:24:28,792
"Nothing has ever been
hasn't passed before."

909
01:24:28,997 --> 01:24:35,459
"Colors of life running free.
Paint this new world I can see."

910
01:24:49,284 --> 01:24:52,879
"Truth is beautiful and beautiful
is the ultimate truth."

911
01:24:55,924 --> 01:25:00,691
"Life appears a fiilm."

912
01:25:02,831 --> 01:25:05,629
"Truth is beautiful and
beautiful is the ultimate truth."

913
01:25:05,934 --> 01:25:08,994
"Life appears a fiilm."

914
01:25:09,137 --> 01:25:13,733
"One happy scene
followed by a sad."

915
01:25:14,142 --> 01:25:17,509
"Similarly, changes
the phases of life."

916
01:25:17,645 --> 01:25:20,808
"Similarly, changes
the phases of life."

917
01:25:20,949 --> 01:25:24,248
"Similarly, changes
the phases of life."

918
01:25:26,121 --> 01:25:29,579
"My heart beats and say,
you are very beautiful!"

919
01:25:29,824 --> 01:25:32,850
"I feel restless,
something is happening."

920
01:25:46,941 --> 01:25:50,934
"The intoxication has
such rhythm."

921
01:25:53,748 --> 01:25:57,411
"If it's stamped by a heart."

922
01:26:00,255 --> 01:26:03,622
"The intoxication has
such rhythm."

923
01:26:03,858 --> 01:26:06,691
"If it's stamped by a heart."

924
01:26:06,828 --> 01:26:09,956
"Anyone who sinks
in the ocean of love...

925
01:26:10,064 --> 01:26:12,430
...would successfully cross it."

926
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:15,364
"May he be anyone then."

927
01:26:15,503 --> 01:26:18,768
"May he be anyone then."

928
01:26:18,907 --> 01:26:22,001
"May he be anyone then."

929
01:26:23,778 --> 01:26:27,111
"My heart beats and say,
you are very beautiful!"

930
01:26:27,215 --> 01:26:30,480
"I feel restless,
something is happening."

931
01:26:31,052 --> 01:26:34,249
"Even the moon would can't stop
looking at you."

932
01:26:34,422 --> 01:26:37,391
"You are a nature's gift."

933
01:26:37,592 --> 01:26:41,084
"Even the moon would can't stop
looking at you."

934
01:26:41,229 --> 01:26:46,565
"You are a nature's gift."
