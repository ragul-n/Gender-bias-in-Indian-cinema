1
00:01:14,044 --> 00:01:16,515
The police is making an
all out effort to nab him.

2
00:01:16,847 --> 00:01:19,546
I've heard anyone giving news on
him will also be given a reward.

3
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:21,547
Yes, but why will anyone
inform the police about him?

4
00:01:22,092 --> 00:01:24,062
The police may consider
him a murderer. . .

5
00:01:24,174 --> 00:01:26,543
but the common man
considers it a good deed.

6
00:01:26,697 --> 00:01:28,564
Those he killed were goons.

7
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:30,568
Nothing has happened yet.

8
00:01:31,101 --> 00:01:34,073
Even after killing Lobo,
has he been caught?

9
00:01:35,105 --> 00:01:40,070
Mr. Sharma, I think the CM will have
to appoint a special force. . .

10
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,198
for this task.

11
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:44,330
He is very smart and cunning.

12
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:48,075
He has killed four people
one after the other.

13
00:01:48,639 --> 00:01:50,609
Yet the police has
not been able to touch him.

14
00:01:50,721 --> 00:01:52,691
Why? Why??

15
00:01:53,123 --> 00:01:57,531
I don't want to hear any excuses
Intensify surveillance.

16
00:01:57,848 --> 00:02:01,788
Check every car. Look in every
nook and corner of the city.

17
00:02:02,092 --> 00:02:04,563
I want that man arrested!

18
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:31,356
What do you
want to explain to me?

19
00:02:31,642 --> 00:02:34,842
The man who the police has
charge sheeted as a killer. . .

20
00:02:35,165 --> 00:02:38,137
who has committed three murders and
created terror in the city. . .

21
00:02:38,248 --> 00:02:40,115
is asking me to defend his case?

22
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,117
Not three, I have
committed four murders.

23
00:02:43,173 --> 00:02:45,644
Seems you have not read
today's evening news.

24
00:02:46,697 --> 00:02:51,662
The police has labeled me murderer,
but I will be deemed a murderer. . .

25
00:02:51,782 --> 00:02:53,649
when the court will convict me.

26
00:02:54,585 --> 00:02:59,083
And Mr. Khurana, for renowned lawyers
like you, to save men like me. . .

27
00:03:01,151 --> 00:03:02,620
from the gallows,
is petty job.

28
00:03:03,634 --> 00:03:06,606
Mr. Vishal Agnihotri, I defend
cases in court to uphold justice.

29
00:03:07,157 --> 00:03:10,129
I have not become a lawyer
to defend murderers like you.

30
00:03:10,441 --> 00:03:12,536
Whatever the circumstances,
you have committed murders.

31
00:03:12,683 --> 00:03:13,651
You have committed a crime.

32
00:03:13,764 --> 00:03:17,362
I have committed no crime! Don't call
what I have committed a crime. . .

33
00:03:17,568 --> 00:03:20,130
because it was necessary for
this city, for its peace.

34
00:03:20,691 --> 00:03:24,152
By wiping out those four men,
I have done a good deed.

35
00:03:24,695 --> 00:03:28,156
And I don't want to spend
my life behind bars for it.

36
00:03:28,699 --> 00:03:30,669
Nor spend my life
trying to escape law.

37
00:03:31,221 --> 00:03:32,690
Because I have committed no crime.

38
00:03:33,223 --> 00:03:35,922
And you.
I know everything about you.

39
00:03:36,226 --> 00:03:37,695
How many criminals you have
got released. . .

40
00:03:37,828 --> 00:03:40,698
and how much money you have taken
for it, I know everything.

41
00:03:41,712 --> 00:03:46,677
Don't make me waste time exposing
you. Tell me how much money you want.

42
00:03:46,837 --> 00:03:48,203
50 million, 100 million?

43
00:03:57,688 --> 00:03:59,658
- Like to take a drink?
- I don't drink.

44
00:04:01,692 --> 00:04:05,655
I accept the price you have
quoted for your case.

45
00:04:06,216 --> 00:04:10,681
But even I want to know something.
The man who the police is after. . .

46
00:04:11,221 --> 00:04:13,590
who is looking for a
corner to hide himself. . .

47
00:04:13,704 --> 00:04:16,174
how will he arrange
100 million rupees?

48
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:20,207
Mr. Khurana, if I have been defamed,
I have also earned a reputation.

49
00:04:20,991 --> 00:04:24,931
- You will get the money.
- Alright, then keep your promise.

50
00:04:25,235 --> 00:04:26,704
Surrender yourself to the police.

51
00:04:27,237 --> 00:04:28,706
News in detail.

52
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:34,605
The hide and seek between a criminal,
Vishal Agnihotri and the police. . .

53
00:04:34,765 --> 00:04:35,733
ended today.

54
00:04:35,846 --> 00:04:39,718
Vishal Agnihotri surrendered
himself to the police today.

55
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:45,255
He has been charge sheeted
for murdering four renowned men.

56
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:46,742
The police was looking for him.

57
00:04:47,778 --> 00:04:52,048
Mr. Khurana, does Vishal's surrender
mean he only has committed the murders?

58
00:04:52,302 --> 00:04:56,003
You are mistaken.
He has surrendered because. . .

59
00:04:56,306 --> 00:04:57,707
he wants to save himself
the bother.

60
00:04:58,228 --> 00:05:00,198
Sir, you have never
lost a case in your career.

61
00:05:00,751 --> 00:05:04,714
Just because the police claims so,
it doesn't mean he is a murderer.

62
00:05:05,035 --> 00:05:08,235
The court will decide that.
Wait for the truth to be exposed.

63
00:05:15,045 --> 00:05:16,981
You have to sign
these papers, Vishal.

64
00:05:17,287 --> 00:05:21,752
Your case has been admitted in court
and the first hearing is on the 7th.

65
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:26,775
I think this matter will
stretch for four hearings.

66
00:05:27,818 --> 00:05:31,279
I have got the orders to shift you
to the crime branch canceled.

67
00:05:31,582 --> 00:05:35,282
You will stay here now.
I know some officers here.

68
00:05:35,826 --> 00:05:37,693
They will take good care of you.

69
00:05:37,828 --> 00:05:40,298
Just don't get into trouble here.

70
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:42,781
You cannot keep a
check on your temper.

71
00:05:43,113 --> 00:05:46,553
I don't want anything new to
be added to your charge sheet.

72
00:05:47,357 --> 00:05:49,828
I am not presenting you in court
in the first few hearings.

73
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,558
I have attached medical reports.

74
00:05:52,843 --> 00:05:56,806
It is possible some medical officer
of the police cokes to examine you.

75
00:05:56,967 --> 00:05:59,768
With him. . .
- Don't worry, Mr. Khurana.

76
00:06:01,892 --> 00:06:03,759
I won't make any mistakes here.

77
00:06:05,816 --> 00:06:09,779
Even I don't want any small matters
to be added to the charge sheet.

78
00:06:11,341 --> 00:06:14,542
As it is, you are tense
about my case.

79
00:06:15,145 --> 00:06:18,812
Yes Vishal, this is the
first case in my career. . .

80
00:06:19,349 --> 00:06:21,547
about which I am really tensed.

81
00:06:22,352 --> 00:06:26,817
I have never faced defeat.
That could also be the reason.

82
00:06:27,758 --> 00:06:33,828
Mr. Khurana, I have more faith
in your capability than you.

83
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:37,322
You will win this case.

84
00:06:37,768 --> 00:06:43,838
Believe me, after this case,
your name will be remembered. . .

85
00:06:44,374 --> 00:06:45,843
in the history of law.

86
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,339
Mr. Khurana was wonderful!

87
00:06:51,662 --> 00:06:53,859
He shattered the police defence.

88
00:06:54,184 --> 00:06:56,883
Can a lawyer like Khurana
ever lose a case?

89
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:43,205
Your honour, I agree that whatever
evidence I collected against Vishal. . .

90
00:07:43,434 --> 00:07:49,811
Mr. Khurana has been shattering
those witnesses and evidence. . .

91
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,930
since the last here hearings.

92
00:07:52,242 --> 00:07:56,182
With his talent,
Mr. Khurana. . .

93
00:07:56,447 --> 00:07:59,350
has succeeded in proving the
truth to be false and vice versa.

94
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:01,757
But I have not
yet given up hope. . .

95
00:08:01,892 --> 00:08:03,862
fearing that the court
may give a wrong verdict.

96
00:08:04,415 --> 00:08:07,386
Setting free a murderer like
Vishal. . .

97
00:08:07,538 --> 00:08:09,906
will send a wrong signal to the youth
of the country, that terrorism. . .

98
00:08:12,423 --> 00:08:16,385
Mr. Sinha is deviating
from the case. . .

99
00:08:16,947 --> 00:08:20,910
the proceedings of which are to
prove. . .

100
00:08:21,031 --> 00:08:26,907
whether Vishal is connected
with these four murders or not.

101
00:08:27,478 --> 00:08:31,942
And my honorable friend,
rather than talk on this issue. . .

102
00:08:32,483 --> 00:08:35,944
is worrying about the
future of the country.

103
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:42,462
My Lord,
I can understand his problem.

104
00:08:42,973 --> 00:08:46,845
In all the last hearings, he has
been unable to gather evidence. . .

105
00:08:47,017 --> 00:08:48,486
against Vishal Agnihotri.

106
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:53,984
He has nothing to present
before the court today.

107
00:08:54,505 --> 00:08:57,237
So he is trying to probe matters. . .

108
00:08:57,468 --> 00:09:00,440
and also deviate from the case.

109
00:09:00,711 --> 00:09:04,913
My Lord, I want to go back to the
argument we had in our last hearing.

110
00:09:05,476 --> 00:09:07,946
It was the night of 7th November.

111
00:09:08,479 --> 00:09:13,444
An old woman, along with her kid,
bangs into an autorickshaw.

112
00:09:13,764 --> 00:09:17,465
Vishal Agnihotri witnesses the incident.

113
00:09:17,648 --> 00:09:21,348
He catches hold of the rickshaw
driver and takes the old woman. . .

114
00:09:21,492 --> 00:09:22,960
and her kid to Bombay hospital.

115
00:09:23,494 --> 00:09:25,360
The duty officer Dr. Patel. . .

116
00:09:25,496 --> 00:09:29,960
informs the closest police
station at Shanti Nagar.

117
00:09:31,542 --> 00:09:34,514
Thereafter, inspector Sharma,
and constable Mhatre. . .

118
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:36,492
completed the investigations.

119
00:09:36,787 --> 00:09:42,993
During investigation, Vishal was made
to stay in hospital for about two hours.

120
00:09:43,554 --> 00:09:49,521
To prove that, I'd like to present
some witnesses and evidence in court.

121
00:10:25,636 --> 00:10:30,510
My Lord, it has been proved beyond
doubt that my client. . .

122
00:10:30,641 --> 00:10:33,613
has no hand in any
of the four murders.

123
00:10:34,164 --> 00:10:39,540
Now the question arises that
why is an innocent youth. . .

124
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:41,118
booked for four murders.

125
00:10:41,652 --> 00:10:45,615
My Lord, he is a victim of
personal enmity with the police.

126
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:48,840
Some time ago, he had protested
against police atrocity. . .

127
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:50,875
outside Nana Chowk police station.

128
00:10:51,702 --> 00:10:54,172
He was even involved in
fisticuffs with them.

129
00:10:54,184 --> 00:10:56,655
For which, he had spent
four nights in police lock up.

130
00:10:56,787 --> 00:10:59,087
Since then, the police considered
him a thorn in their side.

131
00:11:00,631 --> 00:11:05,095
Then, the police, to hide their
failure & prove their superiority. . .

132
00:11:05,636 --> 00:11:08,608
framed Vishal for these murders.

133
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:14,104
My request is that no more atrocity
be committed against this youth.

134
00:11:14,244 --> 00:11:17,615
Give your verdict
and acquit him honorably.

135
00:11:18,168 --> 00:11:21,630
After considering the
entire proceedings. . .

136
00:11:21,852 --> 00:11:28,161
it is clear that the police has
no concrete evidence or witness. . .

137
00:11:28,298 --> 00:11:33,172
on the basis of which the accused,
Vishal Agnihotri can be proved guilty.

138
00:11:33,464 --> 00:11:38,668
The arguments by the defense lawyer
and the evidence presented. . .

139
00:11:38,829 --> 00:11:44,101
prove his innocence. Therefore,
the court honorably acquits. . .

140
00:11:44,234 --> 00:11:45,202
No!

141
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,688
What's going on?

142
00:11:56,246 --> 00:11:57,647
Vishal Agnihotri,
this is contempt of court!

143
00:12:01,692 --> 00:12:03,160
Vishal Agnihotri,
what are you doing!

144
00:12:07,217 --> 00:12:09,688
Vishal Agnihotri,
this is contempt of court!

145
00:12:17,227 --> 00:12:18,195
Leave him!

146
00:12:36,246 --> 00:12:40,711
I won't run away!
I won't run away!

147
00:12:42,773 --> 00:12:48,239
Magistrate Dogra, Jagdish Khurana's
corpse is lying here.

148
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:50,476
I have killed him.

149
00:12:50,781 --> 00:12:54,242
And you. . . you
resign from that chair.

150
00:12:55,786 --> 00:12:58,086
You have no right
to sit in that chair.

151
00:12:58,228 --> 00:13:02,191
I have saved you today. You were
about to give the wrong verdict.

152
00:13:03,754 --> 00:13:08,218
And this Khurana, he proved in court
that I have committed no murder.

153
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,228
That I am innocent.

154
00:13:11,762 --> 00:13:15,725
No! I have not committed one,
but four murders.

155
00:13:16,767 --> 00:13:20,730
He was aware of this.

156
00:13:21,051 --> 00:13:24,251
Before coming to court,
he had taken all information from me.

157
00:13:24,775 --> 00:13:28,738
He was aware of how
and when I killed who.

158
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:32,752
He had asked me from what
distance I had fired the shot.

159
00:13:33,824 --> 00:13:35,794
Whether the bullet hit him
in the head of chest.

160
00:13:36,306 --> 00:13:39,768
The one who I strangulated, whether
he had bled from the mouth or not.

161
00:13:40,831 --> 00:13:44,794
Were his eyes closed or open,
he knew all that.

162
00:13:46,316 --> 00:13:49,288
Are you understanding something,
Magistrate Dogra?

163
00:13:50,841 --> 00:13:51,809
Do you understand?

164
00:13:53,363 --> 00:13:56,335
He had charged me 100 million
to save me.

165
00:13:56,847 --> 00:14:00,251
Jagdish Khurana was not
a protector of law. . .

166
00:14:01,051 --> 00:14:03,248
he sold justice.

167
00:14:04,815 --> 00:14:09,780
I gave my case to him, not to escape
law, but make law realise its folly.

168
00:14:11,061 --> 00:14:15,001
Is this a court?
Is justice imparted here?

169
00:14:15,826 --> 00:14:18,296
Is truth and
deception exposed here?

170
00:14:20,831 --> 00:14:24,794
No, nothing of the sort happens here.
There's only violation.

171
00:14:25,836 --> 00:14:31,302
The violation of law. People like
Khurana violate the law in every court.

172
00:14:31,642 --> 00:14:36,846
And there is also a man like
him sitting in that chair.

173
00:14:38,889 --> 00:14:44,856
And people like them who act as
audience and watch the fun.

174
00:14:45,896 --> 00:14:48,366
For them, whether it is a court
proceeding, or a juggler's trick. . .

175
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:51,369
their only criteria is to enjoy.

176
00:14:51,902 --> 00:14:53,872
So, are you enjoying?

177
00:14:54,905 --> 00:14:55,873
Enjoy!

178
00:14:56,907 --> 00:14:59,309
Do you understand something,
Magistrate Dogra?

179
00:15:00,631 --> 00:15:04,833
If you just want to have fun,
why put up this pretense of a court?

180
00:15:04,955 --> 00:15:07,825
Put a stop to this all!

181
00:15:12,883 --> 00:15:16,253
Yes, take me to the dungeon.

182
00:15:16,366 --> 00:15:20,740
But all those who I killed
were like him.

183
00:15:20,891 --> 00:15:22,359
They were all rascals like him.

184
00:15:22,893 --> 00:15:26,354
Do you understand something,
Magistrate Dogra?

185
00:15:27,418 --> 00:15:28,886
Do you understand something?

186
00:15:46,116 --> 00:15:49,954
The incident of killing one's
own defense lawyer in court. . .

187
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,897
has shocked the city.

188
00:15:52,443 --> 00:15:56,907
Yesterday, during proceedings,
the accused, Vishal Agnihotri. . .

189
00:15:57,047 --> 00:15:59,848
killed his defence lawyer

190
00:16:01,412 --> 00:16:03,381
Hail Vishal Agnihotri!

191
00:16:04,895 --> 00:16:07,365
Calm down!

192
00:16:08,419 --> 00:16:11,390
Please try to understand my point.

193
00:16:12,342 --> 00:16:14,404
Vishal himself doesn't
want to meet anybody.

194
00:16:14,545 --> 00:16:17,415
Allow us in, we want to
speak to Vishal.

195
00:16:17,548 --> 00:16:19,415
But Vishal doesn't want
to talk to anyone.

196
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:21,419
Nor does he want to meet anyone.

197
00:16:21,712 --> 00:16:25,652
Do one thing.
Give us some more time.

198
00:16:25,756 --> 00:16:30,926
We will talk to Vishal again & check
if he wants to meet you all or not.

199
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:33,439
We will leave only
after meeting Vishal.

200
00:16:34,485 --> 00:16:38,448
Quiet! I said none
of you can meet Vishal.

201
00:16:38,969 --> 00:16:41,941
On the demand of many social
organisations & big personalities. . .

202
00:16:42,493 --> 00:16:45,362
the government has agreed
to an inquiry committee. . .

203
00:16:45,496 --> 00:16:46,464
to look into Vishal's case.

204
00:16:46,977 --> 00:16:51,942
This 15 member committee will look
into every aspect of Vishal's case. . .

205
00:16:52,102 --> 00:16:53,969
and give its verdict.

206
00:16:54,785 --> 00:16:58,155
Look Vishal, what you want
or don't want. . .

207
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:01,406
is definitely your personal view,
your personal decision.

208
00:17:01,952 --> 00:17:04,924
But your case is no more
a personal issue.

209
00:17:05,956 --> 00:17:08,928
Every man in this city
is talking about you.

210
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,941
Infact, the people are even
questioning police honesty.

211
00:17:14,765 --> 00:17:18,466
I know what you
have done is not wrong.

212
00:17:19,009 --> 00:17:22,471
Our system created
this situation before you.

213
00:17:23,013 --> 00:17:24,983
Agreed you have killed
a few outlaws.

214
00:17:25,776 --> 00:17:28,976
But that is not
going to improve things.

215
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:32,479
There are some more people
who deserve punishment. . .

216
00:17:32,623 --> 00:17:33,989
who are still holding
on to their chair.

217
00:17:35,025 --> 00:17:37,997
When your case is opened
before the committee. . .

218
00:17:38,108 --> 00:17:39,975
people will get to know the truth.

219
00:17:41,031 --> 00:17:45,233
Our department's corrupt officials,
who have supported wrong. . .

220
00:17:45,395 --> 00:17:47,525
those officials should be exposed.

221
00:17:47,638 --> 00:17:49,505
Everyone must know about them.

222
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:54,003
Vishal, every man connected
to the system is not bad.

223
00:17:54,565 --> 00:17:57,537
There are some
good and honest people.

224
00:17:57,568 --> 00:17:59,470
It is due to these few men
that even today. . .

225
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:03,973
we have not lost the
faith of the common man in us.

226
00:18:05,015 --> 00:18:08,477
I and many of my officers are
co-operating with the committee.

227
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:13,501
And I want even you to co-operate.

228
00:18:14,024 --> 00:18:19,491
Alright, I will answer
whatever the committee asks me.

229
00:18:21,031 --> 00:18:24,994
I will watch another show of
pretense of the law, DGP.

230
00:18:25,836 --> 00:18:30,038
But before meeting the committee,
I'd like to go home.

231
00:19:07,077 --> 00:19:08,045
Sachdanand Agnihotri.

232
00:19:57,167 --> 00:20:03,636
Mr. Vishal Agnihotri, the DGP must
have told you about our committee.

233
00:20:04,935 --> 00:20:09,342
I and the other members have been
connected to various aspects. . .

234
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,894
of law and administration.

235
00:20:13,223 --> 00:20:17,186
We have given verdicts
on many serious crimes.

236
00:20:18,709 --> 00:20:21,909
Normally, the law has only one
way of looking at crime.

237
00:20:22,993 --> 00:20:26,694
See the crime as is, & give a
befitting punishment for it.

238
00:20:28,639 --> 00:20:34,207
But yours is the first case where
the law has to deviate from norms.

239
00:20:34,364 --> 00:20:39,740
The aspects of your crime that the
police has kept before the court. . .

240
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:46,217
like your charge-sheet, the evidence
& witnesses in favour or against you. . .

241
00:20:47,257 --> 00:20:51,631
this committee has no intention
of giving verdict. . .

242
00:20:51,782 --> 00:20:53,250
keeping only those in view.

243
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:57,244
This committee also wants to see the
other aspect connected with this case.

244
00:20:58,228 --> 00:21:02,191
And I am sure you will
co-operate with us totally.

245
00:21:02,392 --> 00:21:03,691
Mr. Krishnamurthy, you. . .

246
00:21:06,236 --> 00:21:13,206
Mr. Vishal, a crime like murder
happens in a fit of fury.

247
00:21:14,244 --> 00:21:17,216
And after committing the crime,
generally, one feels remorse.

248
00:21:18,248 --> 00:21:23,213
Did you get this feeling
after killing Khurana?

249
00:21:24,294 --> 00:21:32,266
Mr. Krishnamurthy, after giving
verdict on a criminal how do you feel?

250
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:36,785
Naturally, I feel good,
that I have upheld justice. . .

251
00:21:37,307 --> 00:21:40,769
and have done a good deed
by punishing a criminal.

252
00:21:44,314 --> 00:21:49,279
You feel good after doing a
good deed, you don't feel remorse.

253
00:21:51,321 --> 00:21:56,788
Mr. Vishal must control his speech.

254
00:21:59,049 --> 00:22:01,748
Just one truth got you agitated?

255
00:22:07,297 --> 00:22:10,269
I have not even begun
the chapter yet.

256
00:22:11,301 --> 00:22:19,273
Today, every man here, is talking
of truth, honesty, limitations.

257
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:22,679
If there was such a thing as law,
the word criminal. . .

258
00:22:22,833 --> 00:22:24,530
would not be prefixed to my name.

259
00:22:25,315 --> 00:22:27,786
I wouldn't take to crime
to getjustice.

260
00:22:28,358 --> 00:22:29,827
People would not call me a murderer.

261
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,328
I have been
accused of several murders.

262
00:22:32,443 --> 00:22:34,811
I was not taught to commit murders.

263
00:22:35,365 --> 00:22:37,836
My father was a school teacher.

264
00:22:38,368 --> 00:22:40,839
Imbibing good values
in children was his job.

265
00:22:41,371 --> 00:22:44,070
He ignored his problems
and lived for others.

266
00:22:44,374 --> 00:22:48,075
I'll show you.
See these applications.

267
00:22:48,378 --> 00:22:50,576
He didn't write these
applications for himself.

268
00:22:50,901 --> 00:22:52,369
He used to make the rounds of
governments offices. . .

269
00:22:52,503 --> 00:22:53,869
to help solve people's problems.

270
00:22:54,384 --> 00:22:58,290
Sometimes for someone's land,
sometimes for a girl's dowry. . .

271
00:22:58,429 --> 00:23:00,797
and sometimes for the
treatment of some poor man.

272
00:23:01,351 --> 00:23:04,323
Read them!

273
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:22,087
Don't make those noises, idiots.

274
00:23:22,372 --> 00:23:24,843
Does anyone scare the
one who feeds you?

275
00:23:27,177 --> 00:23:31,379
I know you are angry with me
because I didn't come last Monday.

276
00:23:32,903 --> 00:23:35,875
Slow! Can't you see
the pigeons are flying away?

277
00:23:36,427 --> 00:23:39,193
Master, all my work is done on time.
You are half an hour late today.

278
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:43,392
But Govind. . .
- Master, take your pigeons elsewhere.

279
00:23:43,674 --> 00:23:46,372
If I wait, I'll get late.

280
00:23:47,438 --> 00:23:51,401
I have to take Mr. Chopra's
dog to the vet at 1 O'clock.

281
00:23:51,922 --> 00:23:54,392
And then arrange for my cure.

282
00:23:55,446 --> 00:23:57,210
You are drunk early in the morning?

283
00:23:57,448 --> 00:23:59,349
No Master, I drank to sober
down from last night's high.

284
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:03,351
You drink in the morning to
sober down from last night's high.

285
00:24:03,894 --> 00:24:05,864
And then get high
in the evening again.

286
00:24:06,417 --> 00:24:09,115
If you always want to be on a high,
why do you sober down at all?

287
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,370
You are the first man
I meet in the morning.

288
00:24:12,663 --> 00:24:14,097
Atleast meet me sober.

289
00:24:15,426 --> 00:24:18,397
I'd to go to Chowgule's house. Wonder
if I have brought his application.

290
00:24:18,909 --> 00:24:20,377
Take, you feed this to the birds.
Let me check my bag.

291
00:24:22,433 --> 00:24:25,894
The birds have eaten enough.
Arrangement for my drink is made!

292
00:24:26,957 --> 00:24:28,927
Take, this is the Mayor's letter.

293
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,140
You can admit him to Tata Hospital
without paying any expenses.

294
00:24:33,444 --> 00:24:36,905
- Master, you have done so. . .
- Come on! What have I done?

295
00:24:37,247 --> 00:24:41,951
Just did a running around.
No big deal.

296
00:24:42,973 --> 00:24:44,943
Go get me tea.

297
00:24:45,496 --> 00:24:48,957
The police caught the idol thieves,
recovered the idol from them. . .

298
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,470
and arrested the temple priest.

299
00:24:54,505 --> 00:24:57,875
Did you read this, Ma?
- Give me the paper.

300
00:24:57,988 --> 00:25:01,392
If your father lays hands on it,
he'll only talk about them all day.

301
00:25:02,433 --> 00:25:04,630
He had left at 6 in the morning,
and is not back home yet.

302
00:25:07,478 --> 00:25:11,942
Where do I hide this?
. . .No, he will find it here.

303
00:25:16,246 --> 00:25:17,442
This place is okay.

304
00:25:24,495 --> 00:25:27,956
Where were you?
- Offer these flowers in the temple.

305
00:25:28,499 --> 00:25:30,969
Has Vishal left?
- No, he is sitting out & having tea.

306
00:25:36,026 --> 00:25:36,994
Found it.

307
00:25:43,033 --> 00:25:45,003
Are you leaving?
- Yes, father.

308
00:25:46,036 --> 00:25:48,006
Did you have breakfast?
- Yes.

309
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:53,504
Go to the bank on your way
and collect the pass book.

310
00:25:55,566 --> 00:25:59,472
Tell your mom to hide the newspaper
in some good place next time.

311
00:26:04,495 --> 00:26:07,956
Idol theft!
- You gave it to him?

312
00:26:09,019 --> 00:26:10,488
No, I found it.

313
00:26:13,544 --> 00:26:17,507
Take your watch.
- I'm leaving, mom.

314
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,506
Here's your tea.

315
00:26:23,313 --> 00:26:28,017
Gayatri, you also bring your
tea here. Sit here with me.

316
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:32,659
If I sit with you and hear about the
whole world, who will do the chores?

317
00:26:33,083 --> 00:26:36,055
You will anyway talk about the
temple, priest, idols all day.

318
00:26:36,567 --> 00:26:39,539
I have so much to do. As it is,
I cannot run around too much now.

319
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:42,561
Your son has started earning now.

320
00:26:42,693 --> 00:26:45,563
Meet people, try getting him married.

321
00:26:45,856 --> 00:26:48,053
Even that will happen.

322
00:26:49,099 --> 00:26:52,071
Tell me, what kind of a
daughter-in-law do you want?

323
00:27:02,553 --> 00:27:05,023
Kanta, is my breakfast ready?
- Yes, madam.

324
00:27:12,563 --> 00:27:15,261
What's this?
- Prospective grooms.

325
00:27:15,566 --> 00:27:17,763
I said I don't
want to marry like this!

326
00:27:18,769 --> 00:27:23,073
We have a bomb explosion
early morning!

327
00:27:23,373 --> 00:27:26,574
You put pictures of
big shots at my feet?

328
00:27:28,378 --> 00:27:29,972
This one's got stuck in my bottoms.

329
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:33,562
This guy's become a doctor
now in America.

330
00:27:33,904 --> 00:27:35,601
That's your old style, daddy.

331
00:27:35,906 --> 00:27:39,345
First you'll show me the pictures,
then ask me to choose one of them.

332
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:41,394
Then you will match horoscopes.

333
00:27:41,632 --> 00:27:45,595
And then you only will say
their stars are no good.

334
00:27:45,916 --> 00:27:50,118
That's old style. There is
no excitement in this process.

335
00:27:50,401 --> 00:27:51,835
I'll get married in new style.

336
00:27:52,162 --> 00:27:56,034
The fun is when someone bangs
into me, I fall, he holds me. . .

337
00:27:56,166 --> 00:27:59,571
and I look into his eyes and say,
'he's the one! '

338
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:04,331
You will ruin me.
Please don't bang into some crook. . .

339
00:28:04,615 --> 00:28:06,379
who will make me a
pauper from a millionaire.

340
00:28:06,617 --> 00:28:12,083
Love is love. When you fall in love,
you don't care about money or society.

341
00:28:13,143 --> 00:28:15,614
But try to understand my point. . .

342
00:28:16,627 --> 00:28:21,592
You are unnecessarily getting upset
over a small matter.

343
00:28:21,912 --> 00:28:28,118
I know Neha. She will bang into the
right guy at the right time.

344
00:28:28,278 --> 00:28:30,043
You don't care about the plants.

345
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,631
If anything happens to my plants,
I won't spare you!

346
00:28:36,687 --> 00:28:37,655
No!

347
00:28:44,695 --> 00:28:46,665
This is what I had dreamt of.

348
00:28:46,977 --> 00:28:49,174
Banging, falling, and steadying.

349
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:53,090
Then looking into each other's eyes.

350
00:28:53,704 --> 00:28:57,667
He's the one!
I love you!

351
00:29:04,675 --> 00:29:07,647
What's happening?

352
00:29:10,681 --> 00:29:13,151
It's happened! Something's happened!
- What's happened?

353
00:29:15,686 --> 00:29:16,654
Tell him.

354
00:29:17,207 --> 00:29:19,678
Dad, I turned back suddenly, banged
into him, fell down, then he. . .

355
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:22,178
Then he what?
- Saved me.

356
00:29:22,693 --> 00:29:26,656
He did? It's done now?
Now leave his hand.

357
00:29:28,218 --> 00:29:31,190
Mr. Nayar, when she was falling,
couldn't you have saved her?

358
00:29:31,702 --> 00:29:33,672
You have been handling
all my jobs since the last 1 7 years.

359
00:29:34,224 --> 00:29:38,187
What happened to you today?
You just stood and stared?

360
00:29:43,233 --> 00:29:46,695
What's going on!
Come with me!

361
00:29:47,758 --> 00:29:52,222
Not you, you come with me.
I'll get your eyes tested.

362
00:29:52,763 --> 00:29:55,233
So that you bang into
the right person.

363
00:30:09,571 --> 00:30:13,032
''Mad, crazy, vagabond''

364
00:30:13,575 --> 00:30:16,547
''What name do I call you by?''

365
00:30:17,098 --> 00:30:20,070
''Should I behold you in my eyes''

366
00:30:20,582 --> 00:30:24,043
''Or keep you in my heart''

367
00:30:24,626 --> 00:30:27,598
''Whatever name you like''

368
00:30:28,109 --> 00:30:31,081
''Call me by that name''

369
00:30:31,633 --> 00:30:35,094
''Through your eyes''

370
00:30:35,397 --> 00:30:39,097
''Let me enter your heart''

371
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:11,100
''My desire is my beloved''

372
00:31:12,153 --> 00:31:14,123
''He's my love, my passion''

373
00:31:15,156 --> 00:31:18,128
''How do I tell you''

374
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:22,132
''How much I wait for you''

375
00:31:22,924 --> 00:31:25,623
''You have my name on your lips''

376
00:31:26,648 --> 00:31:28,618
''Ours is a bond forever''

377
00:31:29,691 --> 00:31:33,152
''I can give up the whole world''

378
00:31:33,695 --> 00:31:36,165
''When I have your hand in mine''

379
00:31:36,698 --> 00:31:39,670
''Spirited, lover boy, carefree''

380
00:31:40,181 --> 00:31:43,153
''What name do I call you by?''

381
00:31:43,705 --> 00:31:47,166
''Should I behold you in my eyes''

382
00:31:47,709 --> 00:31:50,681
''Or keep you in my heart?''

383
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:54,192
''Keep me in your heart''

384
00:32:31,233 --> 00:32:34,205
''You are some damsel
come from heaven''

385
00:32:34,716 --> 00:32:37,186
''I'm lost in your love''

386
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:41,732
''My heart cannot forget
you for a minute''

387
00:32:42,244 --> 00:32:45,216
''How am I at fault?''

388
00:32:45,767 --> 00:32:48,238
''The whole world is no
comparison against you''

389
00:32:49,251 --> 00:32:51,721
''I wear your flower in my tresses''

390
00:32:52,774 --> 00:32:59,243
''I'll accept whatever sorrow I may
have to suffer for your sake''

391
00:32:59,781 --> 00:33:02,753
''Beloved, darling, dearest''

392
00:33:03,305 --> 00:33:06,277
''What name do I call you by?''

393
00:33:06,788 --> 00:33:10,192
''Should I behold you in my eyes''

394
00:33:10,752 --> 00:33:14,214
''Or keep you in my heart?''

395
00:34:46,648 --> 00:34:47,616
Leave me!

396
00:34:57,179 --> 00:35:00,151
Forgive me!
- He's apologizing, let him go.

397
00:35:01,183 --> 00:35:03,153
He should be handed
over to the police.

398
00:35:04,186 --> 00:35:06,053
If I let him go,
he will pick other people's pocket.

399
00:35:06,188 --> 00:35:07,588
Forgive me!

400
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:10,600
Alright, we'll take him
to the police station.

401
00:35:11,153 --> 00:35:14,125
Go get a rickshaw.
I'll hold on to him till then.

402
00:35:14,636 --> 00:35:19,601
Go! I'll hold on to him.

403
00:35:20,162 --> 00:35:21,130
You can go.

404
00:35:23,685 --> 00:35:27,648
My son hits very hard.
- Yes sir, he does.

405
00:35:29,171 --> 00:35:32,143
Did you begin with me, or have
you picked someone's pocket before?

406
00:35:32,694 --> 00:35:33,662
I started with you.

407
00:35:33,975 --> 00:35:35,672
Which means you
failed your first attempt.

408
00:35:36,698 --> 00:35:40,661
Why don't you do some honest work?
Why do you steal?

409
00:35:41,703 --> 00:35:44,675
Yes sir, I'll take up some work.

410
00:35:49,231 --> 00:35:52,203
Keep this money.
Visit a doctor.

411
00:35:52,714 --> 00:35:57,179
Add turmeric to milk and drink before
you sleep at night. You'll be fine.

412
00:35:57,759 --> 00:35:58,727
Now scram!

413
00:36:06,768 --> 00:36:09,171
Where did he go?
- He ran away.

414
00:36:09,691 --> 00:36:10,659
Ran away?

415
00:36:10,972 --> 00:36:15,175
I tried holding on to him, but
he was stronger. What could I do?

416
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:20,690
Look, there is no cure to suspicion.

417
00:36:20,822 --> 00:36:27,200
If you feel I deliberately
let him go, what can I do?

418
00:36:27,509 --> 00:36:31,210
I was just saying. . .
- Close that chapter and have tea.

419
00:36:31,753 --> 00:36:36,718
The chapter closed long ago,
I am only stretching the matter.

420
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:41,202
Right Vishal? Look Gayatri,
he is still staring at me.

421
00:36:42,764 --> 00:36:44,734
Gayatri, he smashed his face.

422
00:36:46,288 --> 00:36:49,749
Why didn't you give him
some money for medication?

423
00:36:49,891 --> 00:36:50,859
I gave him rupees. . .

424
00:36:55,297 --> 00:36:56,265
The tea has gone cold.

425
00:37:04,826 --> 00:37:08,231
Why were you hesitating to
come to the temple today?

426
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:12,713
Mom, actually. . .
- Shut-up! Don't make excuses.

427
00:37:13,275 --> 00:37:16,736
You know I never forgo prayers
on 'Ekadashi'.

428
00:37:16,878 --> 00:37:19,247
And who do I offer prayers
and fast for anyway?

429
00:37:19,761 --> 00:37:22,232
For you.
- For me?

430
00:37:22,764 --> 00:37:25,736
Yes, I come and pray for
a good bride for you.

431
00:37:26,288 --> 00:37:29,260
Even I don't come here to ask anything
for myself. Even I pray for you.

432
00:37:29,811 --> 00:37:32,282
Is it?
And what do you pray for me?

433
00:37:34,816 --> 00:37:37,788
I pray that you get
a good daughter-in-law.

434
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,268
Naughty!

435
00:37:39,821 --> 00:37:44,286
But how will our wish be fulfilled?
You never take any interest in girls.

436
00:37:44,826 --> 00:37:49,791
I am interested in a girl.
- Really?

437
00:37:49,951 --> 00:37:52,616
Matters have moved ahead.
- But who is she?

438
00:37:52,834 --> 00:37:54,804
I'll introduce her to you soon.
As soon as the time. . .

439
00:37:55,837 --> 00:38:00,302
Time. . . time!
Ma, I wanted to make a call!

440
00:38:05,367 --> 00:38:09,171
You were going to call me at 10.
- I'm sorry.

441
00:38:09,291 --> 00:38:14,256
Fraud! Alright, I'll wait
for you at 1 at National restaurant.

442
00:38:14,816 --> 00:38:18,779
We'll lunch together.
- Neha, I am very busy.

443
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:20,603
I have some meetings to attend.

444
00:38:20,822 --> 00:38:24,284
And moreover, your dad keeps
an eagle's eye on me nowadays.

445
00:38:24,586 --> 00:38:27,285
I don't know anything!
You have to be there at 1.

446
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:31,310
Alright, call me up in office,
I'll think of something.

447
00:38:31,433 --> 00:38:35,305
What if dad catches us
talking to each other?

448
00:38:35,837 --> 00:38:38,308
You have plotted to
put me in trouble.

449
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,850
Duffer, you will call me
as Seema, not Neha.

450
00:38:42,364 --> 00:38:45,336
And Seema will have some problem
which only I can solve.

451
00:38:45,887 --> 00:38:48,358
So I will ask for leave.
Understand?

452
00:38:50,892 --> 00:38:56,359
I notice Neha is
very happy these days.

453
00:38:56,898 --> 00:39:01,363
Her behavior has changed completely.

454
00:39:01,903 --> 00:39:07,370
She is always humming songs,
that too, romantic songs.

455
00:39:07,869 --> 00:39:12,243
I see her glowing face,
and then my horoscope.

456
00:39:12,354 --> 00:39:16,317
I'm going through a bad phase.

457
00:39:16,878 --> 00:39:22,345
I think Vishal and her affair
is going strong.

458
00:39:22,884 --> 00:39:25,355
Youngsters nowadays are very forward.

459
00:39:25,887 --> 00:39:31,854
In our times, we took months to
hold even our wife's hand.

460
00:39:32,414 --> 00:39:34,884
But now, they begin holding
each other immediately.

461
00:39:35,417 --> 00:39:37,387
He's coming!

462
00:39:39,901 --> 00:39:43,363
He looks very happy.
He's whistling away.

463
00:39:44,946 --> 00:39:45,914
What did you say?

464
00:39:46,188 --> 00:39:48,385
Stop picking your ears,
you'll go deaf.

465
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:50,419
Did you say something?

466
00:39:55,437 --> 00:39:58,409
You look upset. Anything serious?

467
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,917
No.
- I'll give you good news.

468
00:40:01,043 --> 00:40:02,909
Patel and Sons has signed
a contract with us.

469
00:40:03,245 --> 00:40:05,340
We now have four more
distributors in Gujarat.

470
00:40:05,487 --> 00:40:08,687
Here are their contracts. Didn't
I say I will do this job in a week?

471
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:11,441
I want every job to
be done in a jiffy.

472
00:40:15,977 --> 00:40:17,446
You can go, now.

473
00:40:33,035 --> 00:40:35,005
Go to your cabin.

474
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:50,520
Yes Neha, tell me.
- No, I'm Seema.

475
00:40:50,652 --> 00:40:52,747
Who?
- Seema.

476
00:40:53,055 --> 00:40:55,025
Seema?
- Yes. Please give me Vishal.

477
00:40:55,177 --> 00:40:57,044
I have urgent work with him.
- Alright.

478
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:01,521
It's Neha on the line,
and says she is Seema.

479
00:41:02,064 --> 00:41:04,432
Vishal, your call.
- My call?

480
00:41:04,586 --> 00:41:05,554
Yes, it's for you.

481
00:41:14,036 --> 00:41:15,504
Seema here.
- Yes Seema, tell me.

482
00:41:16,038 --> 00:41:20,502
Mom is coming by Benares Express.
Go to the station to pick her.

483
00:41:21,043 --> 00:41:25,006
Sure. Benares Express, right?

484
00:41:30,572 --> 00:41:34,034
Sir, my friend's mother is coming
by Benares Express. I need to go.

485
00:41:34,176 --> 00:41:38,048
Sure. Go.
- You are great!

486
00:41:39,101 --> 00:41:40,069
You are not a man.

487
00:41:42,584 --> 00:41:43,552
You are a great man.

488
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:56,583
See! He fooled us and left. Benares
Express comes at 5 am, not 5 pm.

489
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:10,560
''What cannot be spoken
by the lips''

490
00:42:11,093 --> 00:42:13,563
''What is told with eyes''

491
00:42:25,627 --> 00:42:29,590
''That's what's hidden in my heart''

492
00:42:35,117 --> 00:42:37,587
''What you catch when young''

493
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,630
''What cannot be doused with water''

494
00:42:52,654 --> 00:42:57,119
''My heart is on that fire''

495
00:43:52,234 --> 00:43:54,204
''I am never at peace''

496
00:43:54,716 --> 00:43:57,187
''I am always thinking of you''

497
00:43:57,719 --> 00:43:59,689
''The morning is young,
the evening, beautiful''

498
00:44:00,242 --> 00:44:02,712
''My lips only chant your name''

499
00:44:03,005 --> 00:44:05,202
''It is here, there,
or where?''

500
00:44:05,527 --> 00:44:07,963
''Wonder where the pain of love is''

501
00:44:08,170 --> 00:44:10,640
''What has happened to me,
where am I lost?''

502
00:44:11,213 --> 00:44:13,683
''Your style has floored me''

503
00:44:14,216 --> 00:44:18,179
''A new thirst is suppressed
in my heart''

504
00:45:08,230 --> 00:45:10,200
''A lonely youth is worthless''

505
00:45:10,752 --> 00:45:13,223
''Life is worthless without love''

506
00:45:13,755 --> 00:45:15,725
''What is love if not crazy''

507
00:45:16,238 --> 00:45:18,208
''It won't hold any interest''

508
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:23,725
''What you have told me,
don't tell anyone else''

509
00:45:24,286 --> 00:45:29,251
''Crazy lovers have together written
and read stories of young lovers''

510
00:45:30,292 --> 00:45:34,756
''I hold your love in my heart''

511
00:45:40,062 --> 00:45:42,259
''What cannot be spoken
by the lips''

512
00:45:42,824 --> 00:45:45,295
''What is told with eyes. . .''

513
00:46:10,292 --> 00:46:12,262
Coming!

514
00:46:16,298 --> 00:46:20,261
What happened? What happened?

515
00:46:23,305 --> 00:46:25,275
Tell me something!
What happened?

516
00:46:27,349 --> 00:46:30,810
Vishal!
- What happened, Ma?

517
00:46:32,834 --> 00:46:34,804
I don't know.
He's not saying anything.

518
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:41,823
What happened?
Please tell me.

519
00:46:44,366 --> 00:46:47,338
Sit down here.
- Get me some mouth freshener.

520
00:46:47,489 --> 00:46:48,457
Yes.

521
00:46:53,375 --> 00:46:57,839
What happened, father?

522
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:06,371
A cow got killed under the
train I was travelling in.

523
00:47:06,908 --> 00:47:11,816
Father!
You gave us such a scare.

524
00:47:12,354 --> 00:47:16,818
So what if a cow got killed?
Such incidents are common in cities.

525
00:47:30,372 --> 00:47:32,342
Take, eat this.
- Later.

526
00:47:37,419 --> 00:47:42,885
Did you see it mutilated?
- No.

527
00:47:46,428 --> 00:47:51,894
People were talking.
Even the train stopped.

528
00:47:54,436 --> 00:47:57,897
It was so dark.

529
00:48:01,443 --> 00:48:06,909
And in the dark, forget an animal,
even man cannot see well.

530
00:48:08,410 --> 00:48:10,880
Now remove this thought
out of your mind.

531
00:48:16,418 --> 00:48:20,882
Gayatri, I know you people are
put to immense trouble because of me.

532
00:48:22,424 --> 00:48:27,389
But what do I do?
Why can't I be like other people?

533
00:48:28,430 --> 00:48:32,894
There were so many other people in
the train, but none bothered to look.

534
00:48:35,437 --> 00:48:37,907
They were so indifferent.

535
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:44,948
That's when I realized that
nothing affects people.

536
00:48:48,970 --> 00:48:51,441
How heartless man has become.

537
00:49:08,470 --> 00:49:10,940
Greetings, Mr. Rana.
- Tell me.

538
00:49:11,473 --> 00:49:17,440
These people are from the slums
of Azad Nagar in Malad (E), and I. . .

539
00:49:22,964 --> 00:49:28,931
Master, I have met you before,
in your colony, in a function.

540
00:49:29,491 --> 00:49:31,461
Tell me what I can do for you.

541
00:49:32,014 --> 00:49:36,978
Sir, there is a bus stop near their
colony, and a liquor den near it.

542
00:49:37,499 --> 00:49:42,965
The girls who work return late at
night have to cross that liquor den.

543
00:49:43,505 --> 00:49:45,475
The goons in the liquor den
misbehave with the girls.

544
00:49:45,787 --> 00:49:48,987
Last night, one of them, in an
inebriated state, caught a girl's hand

545
00:49:49,551 --> 00:49:51,020
My son is coming.

546
00:49:53,035 --> 00:49:55,005
Hi dad!
What about my car?

547
00:49:56,038 --> 00:49:59,010
I have deposited two & half million.
Go and take delivery.

548
00:50:02,044 --> 00:50:04,514
So Master, what were you saying?

549
00:50:05,087 --> 00:50:09,050
A goon caught his daughter's
hand last night.

550
00:50:09,571 --> 00:50:13,033
Their daughters are being teased,
and you are taking up their issue.

551
00:50:13,575 --> 00:50:15,545
Can't they talk for themselves?

552
00:50:16,098 --> 00:50:19,070
Mr. Rana, they want you to get that
liquor den removed from there.

553
00:50:19,861 --> 00:50:24,064
Put a stop to the misbehavior
they have to suffer.

554
00:50:24,626 --> 00:50:28,088
Dealing in such matters
is the police's job.

555
00:50:28,630 --> 00:50:30,600
Take your complain to the
police station.

556
00:50:31,113 --> 00:50:33,583
They will not take any action.

557
00:50:34,116 --> 00:50:36,586
I myself lodged a complain
two months ago.

558
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:39,089
That report must
be lost in files by now.

559
00:50:39,641 --> 00:50:43,103
You should take your complain
to a senior police officer.

560
00:50:43,645 --> 00:50:46,845
You know very well that no officer
will get involved in this case. . .

561
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:49,139
because this den
is owned by Gopal Anna.

562
00:50:49,251 --> 00:50:53,123
And Gopal Anna has your protection.
- Don't raise your voice, Master!

563
00:50:56,658 --> 00:50:58,628
This is Jaspal Rana's house.

564
00:50:59,661 --> 00:51:03,624
Those who pass from here, their
heart beats stop for a few moments.

565
00:51:06,708 --> 00:51:11,116
You live in Kandivli, & have brought
me a problem of the people of Malad.

566
00:51:11,633 --> 00:51:13,102
Are you their leader?

567
00:51:16,158 --> 00:51:18,628
I must appreciate your guts.

568
00:51:19,641 --> 00:51:22,112
Despite knowing Gopal Anna is
my henchman. . .

569
00:51:22,644 --> 00:51:26,106
you have collected 12 men and
brought them to my house.

570
00:51:27,649 --> 00:51:31,612
Mr. Rana, today, there are 12 men,
tomorrow there will be 200. . .

571
00:51:31,773 --> 00:51:32,741
and then, 2000.

572
00:51:34,176 --> 00:51:37,148
People who suffer atrocities
won't sit quietly at home.

573
00:51:37,699 --> 00:51:40,170
They have the courage to raise
their voice against injustice now.

574
00:51:40,702 --> 00:51:45,667
Has their courage awakened,
or has it died? Turn around and look.

575
00:51:49,711 --> 00:51:52,683
Your soldiers left the battlefield.

576
00:51:53,715 --> 00:51:56,687
Such passion is not
good at your age, Master.

577
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:01,920
If you sleep with the problems
of people under your pillow. . .

578
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:03,712
you will not get sleep.

579
00:52:04,726 --> 00:52:09,134
Getting a good sleep in old age
is good for your health.

580
00:52:22,704 --> 00:52:24,401
Lankeshwar.
- Yes?

581
00:52:24,706 --> 00:52:27,177
Find out the names of the
men who had come with Master.

582
00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:32,193
A lot is being written in the papers
about the plot at Kala Chowk.

583
00:52:32,714 --> 00:52:34,684
Call all these journalists who are
writing these reports to my office.

584
00:52:34,836 --> 00:52:37,103
I want to talk to them.
- Yes.

585
00:52:37,239 --> 00:52:40,211
Why are you depressed?
What's your problem?

586
00:52:40,522 --> 00:52:44,724
I have received this letter from
Dhaulpur from my elder brother.

587
00:52:45,247 --> 00:52:48,219
What's he written.
- You realise how bad it is. . .

588
00:52:48,770 --> 00:52:54,476
to be young, when your elder
starts bullying you.

589
00:52:54,776 --> 00:53:00,743
My elder brotherjust wrote, without
thinking how this will affect me.

590
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:07,179
What's written in it?
- We two brothers own some land.

591
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:09,711
Now my elder brother
wants to sell the land.

592
00:53:09,831 --> 00:53:16,710
I don't know what reply to give him.
- Keep that letter aside.

593
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:20,730
Mr. Rana. . .
- Don't touch my feet.

594
00:53:21,243 --> 00:53:25,707
Just do your work well.
How much money is in this?

595
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:27,254
Rs.500000.
- That's all?

596
00:53:28,770 --> 00:53:33,235
Mangal, I want atleast Rs.50,00000
from your area by the end of the month

597
00:53:34,776 --> 00:53:38,238
I have promised to give
20 million for the elections.

598
00:53:39,301 --> 00:53:43,264
Even if you have to remove 1-2 people
out of the way, don't hesitate.

599
00:53:45,307 --> 00:53:49,270
Zakir and Shanker will be released
tomorrow. Take their help.

600
00:53:52,834 --> 00:53:57,799
Hello Mr. Rana.
- I'd told you this work must not stop.

601
00:53:58,320 --> 00:53:59,288
I'll see what I can do.

602
00:53:59,441 --> 00:54:02,811
Doesn't Chhugani know I am
constructing this building?

603
00:54:03,325 --> 00:54:06,297
Bring Chhugani to my
farm house tonight.

604
00:54:08,770 --> 00:54:10,239
Didn't you speak to the lawyer?

605
00:54:10,772 --> 00:54:13,744
Why is removing just one
paper from court taking so long?

606
00:54:16,298 --> 00:54:19,270
We must not lose the land
at Kalina Chowk.

607
00:54:20,302 --> 00:54:22,169
It involves 200 million rupees.

608
00:54:22,304 --> 00:54:26,768
The court will give verdict in your
favour. The land is yours.

609
00:54:27,589 --> 00:54:31,791
But what reply do I give
about my land?

610
00:54:33,595 --> 00:54:37,797
I want to meet Mr. Rana.
- Get out!

611
00:54:41,843 --> 00:54:44,314
Let him come.
- Greetings, sir.

612
00:54:44,846 --> 00:54:49,220
What is it?
- My father is missing since 3 days.

613
00:54:49,371 --> 00:54:52,241
I even got a report filed at the
police station, but it's no use.

614
00:54:52,374 --> 00:54:55,835
What is your father's name?
- Jagdish Rastogi.

615
00:54:56,138 --> 00:54:58,335
We won a shop in Kalbadevi.

616
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:02,271
On Wednesday night, my father
closed shop and left for home.

617
00:55:02,384 --> 00:55:06,347
But he didn't reach home. Nobody
listens to us at the police station.

618
00:55:06,908 --> 00:55:08,810
If you could talk
to the Commissioner. . .

619
00:55:11,833 --> 00:55:16,298
Mr. Kamble, what's going
on in the city?

620
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:20,310
What is your police doing
to trace Jagdish Rastogi?

621
00:55:21,883 --> 00:55:24,354
I am not aware of this case.

622
00:55:25,127 --> 00:55:28,327
I think this case will be
with some officer of zone 'C'.

623
00:55:29,131 --> 00:55:30,724
I'll call for the file today
itself and check.

624
00:55:30,892 --> 00:55:33,864
Your checking the file
won't console him.

625
00:55:34,376 --> 00:55:38,077
Find the man. Just think what the
family must be going through. . .

626
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:39,859
whose master has not
reached home since three days.

627
00:55:40,062 --> 00:55:41,860
I'll look into it.

628
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:47,371
Go home. The ACP will himself
look into the matter.

629
00:55:48,910 --> 00:55:51,381
Wherever your father may be,
the police will find him.

630
00:55:51,913 --> 00:55:52,881
Thank you.

631
00:56:00,962 --> 00:56:03,433
Mr. Rana, the problem has
become serious.

632
00:56:03,965 --> 00:56:06,436
It will be better if
you release his father.

633
00:56:06,968 --> 00:56:09,371
Even the media has begun
to write about this case now.

634
00:56:11,413 --> 00:56:13,883
Even you can have a problem.

635
00:56:14,896 --> 00:56:17,367
Everything will be alright
after Rastogi's body is found.

636
00:56:19,181 --> 00:56:24,886
People will stop talking after that.

637
00:56:25,427 --> 00:56:29,891
No Mr. Rana, I think,
killing Rastogi right now. . .

638
00:56:31,953 --> 00:56:34,424
Rastogi will have to die!

639
00:56:35,957 --> 00:56:38,428
He has become very proud
about his riches.

640
00:56:39,961 --> 00:56:43,423
He was poisoning the minds
of his community against me.

641
00:56:49,731 --> 00:56:50,926
Call up Nagesh.

642
00:57:10,952 --> 00:57:15,417
Rastogi, my dad
doesn't want you to be alive.

643
00:57:33,915 --> 00:57:35,383
Where are you going?

644
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:43,384
I am noticing your interest
in studies is increasing.

645
00:57:43,925 --> 00:57:50,894
But today is Sunday.
- And we have a special class today.

646
00:57:51,212 --> 00:57:55,916
And the special teacher of this
special class is Vishal Agnihotri.

647
00:57:56,217 --> 00:57:59,417
And the subjects are
love, romance, fun, enjoyment.

648
00:57:59,941 --> 00:58:02,913
Dad, you misunderstand me.
- I am not misunderstanding you.

649
00:58:03,464 --> 00:58:07,427
I know about your
and Vishal's affair.

650
00:58:07,949 --> 00:58:14,360
But get this clear. I won't
make an employee my son-in-law.

651
00:58:14,916 --> 00:58:17,887
Do you know anything?
You know nothing! Come here!

652
00:58:20,441 --> 00:58:26,408
Look! Who is this?
Your great-grandfather, Hukumchand.

653
00:58:26,527 --> 00:58:31,401
King Bhimraj's only heir.
He had a huge estate.

654
00:58:31,532 --> 00:58:33,399
He owned 50 villages.

655
00:58:33,935 --> 00:58:37,897
Two elephants and 500 horses
always rode with him.

656
00:58:38,219 --> 00:58:43,423
And he is your grandfather,
Raghupati Rao.

657
00:58:43,744 --> 00:58:47,684
After losing his estate,
what was he left with?

658
00:58:47,989 --> 00:58:50,961
Two elephants and a few horses.
He sold them to the circus. . .

659
00:58:51,072 --> 00:58:53,668
and made arrangements for his
livelihood.

660
00:58:53,995 --> 00:58:58,960
And this is your father. I had
nothing when I came to this city.

661
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:04,455
I toiled hard day and night
and became a rich man.

662
00:59:05,006 --> 00:59:08,376
I don't want a good for
nothing fellow to marry you. . .

663
00:59:08,529 --> 00:59:13,437
and usurp my property.
I have worked hard to make my money.

664
00:59:13,975 --> 00:59:17,938
I've had enough!
Come with me!

665
00:59:18,379 --> 00:59:22,342
Since you lost your mother,
I fulfilled your every demand.

666
00:59:22,463 --> 00:59:26,426
I bowed before your every demand.
But what did I get in return?

667
00:59:26,988 --> 00:59:34,458
Get inside the room.
Don't you dare come out of the room!

668
00:59:34,996 --> 00:59:38,959
And I'll smash Vishal's head!
I'll break his hands!

669
00:59:41,002 --> 00:59:45,466
What are you doing? Why are you
being so cruel with an innocent woman?

670
00:59:46,007 --> 00:59:49,468
I am doing the right thing.
I should have done this long ago.

671
00:59:49,650 --> 00:59:52,019
My pampering has spoilt her.

672
00:59:52,533 --> 00:59:56,496
The one who your pampering has spoilt
has taken the car and gone away.

673
00:59:57,058 --> 01:00:01,522
You have locked up Kantabai
in the room.

674
01:00:02,063 --> 01:00:03,031
What are you saying!

675
01:00:03,144 --> 01:00:09,020
Open the door and see for yourself.

676
01:00:13,074 --> 01:00:15,044
Come out!

677
01:00:16,597 --> 01:00:18,066
Why did you put up this pretense?

678
01:00:18,359 --> 01:00:21,456
I dragged you up by your hand
and you didn't even tell me?

679
01:00:21,602 --> 01:00:23,572
How could I have said anything?

680
01:00:24,085 --> 01:00:27,546
You held my hand for
the first time in three years.

681
01:00:28,609 --> 01:00:33,074
First time in three years?
What's wrong with me?

682
01:00:34,615 --> 01:00:40,582
Should I make arrangements of your
marriage along with Neha's?

683
01:00:41,622 --> 01:00:44,594
I won't spare Neha!
- Nothing can be done now.

684
01:00:45,146 --> 01:00:49,610
Those two must be dancing
and singing.

685
01:01:21,662 --> 01:01:25,625
''My love, relent to what my
heart says, it is pounding''

686
01:01:35,196 --> 01:01:39,159
''When you hold my hand,
my heart pounds''

687
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:43,643
''My heart pounds,
I slowly begin to swoon''

688
01:01:44,205 --> 01:01:48,168
''When I think about you,
my heart pounds''

689
01:01:48,689 --> 01:01:52,652
''When I come close to you,
my heart pounds''

690
01:01:53,214 --> 01:01:57,678
''My heart pounds,
I slowly begin to swoon''

691
01:01:57,979 --> 01:02:02,181
''My love. . .''

692
01:02:22,723 --> 01:02:26,185
''You have cast such a
magic spell on your lover''

693
01:02:26,727 --> 01:02:30,690
''He's in a daze and swoons
in gay abandon''

694
01:02:45,266 --> 01:02:48,238
''Even I have protected myself
for 18 years''

695
01:02:49,270 --> 01:02:53,233
''But when I saw you,
I surrendered myself to you''

696
01:02:53,754 --> 01:02:57,717
''Having got the gift of your love,
my heart pounds''

697
01:02:58,279 --> 01:03:02,242
''My love. . .''

698
01:03:13,254 --> 01:03:17,217
''When I close my eyes,
you come in my dreams''

699
01:03:17,498 --> 01:03:21,199
''And then torment me
in my dreams''

700
01:03:35,796 --> 01:03:39,759
''Your beauty won't
let me live in peace''

701
01:03:40,281 --> 01:03:43,742
''I cannot bear even a
moment's separation from you''

702
01:03:44,285 --> 01:03:48,248
''I toss and turn all night,
my heart pounds''

703
01:03:48,809 --> 01:03:52,772
''When I think about you,
my heart pounds''

704
01:03:53,334 --> 01:03:57,798
''My heart pounds,
I slowly begin to swoon. . .''

705
01:04:53,554 --> 01:04:58,018
Where were you? I begin to get
worried. Look, it's so late.

706
01:04:58,599 --> 01:05:02,060
I have laid the table since so long.
Sit down, have dinner first.

707
01:05:11,051 --> 01:05:16,016
What happened?
Say something.

708
01:05:17,057 --> 01:05:20,519
I witnessed a great
injustice being done today.

709
01:05:22,583 --> 01:05:32,058
I saw an atrocity being committed,
& I just stood & stared at the scene

710
01:05:34,074 --> 01:05:37,536
My lips were sealed,
I could not scream.

711
01:05:38,078 --> 01:05:40,048
Why, what was it you witnessed?

712
01:05:41,122 --> 01:05:47,088
I saw some goons taking away a girl
from the middle of the street.

713
01:05:48,609 --> 01:05:53,574
And one of those goons was Nagesh,
the son of Jaspal Rana.

714
01:05:55,136 --> 01:05:59,098
The Jaspal Rana, who claims to
be a leader and social worker. . .

715
01:06:00,141 --> 01:06:02,111
is such a powerful leader today. . .

716
01:06:03,144 --> 01:06:07,107
that his son committed such a
heinous crime on the street. . .

717
01:06:07,668 --> 01:06:09,638
and the police is hand
in glove with him?

718
01:06:12,593 --> 01:06:19,061
This 60 year old man who has seen
us being freed from slavery. . .

719
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:22,579
was helplessly
watching this incident.

720
01:06:24,605 --> 01:06:27,075
I felt like going and
reporting to the police. . .

721
01:06:27,648 --> 01:06:31,018
but later, I realized that even
the police is in it with them.

722
01:06:31,132 --> 01:06:34,593
No, don't tell anyone anything.
And even you didn't see anything.

723
01:06:36,137 --> 01:06:38,003
Please listen to me this once.

724
01:06:38,139 --> 01:06:40,109
I have never stopped you
from doing anything until now.

725
01:06:40,661 --> 01:06:42,130
But you will have to keep
out of this.

726
01:06:42,263 --> 01:06:43,629
We don't want to mess
with such people.

727
01:06:43,944 --> 01:06:47,145
You have my promise.
You didn't see anything, that's all!

728
01:06:52,673 --> 01:06:53,641
Take the body.

729
01:06:55,196 --> 01:06:59,159
Look, Salukhe's daughter's news
has come in the newspaper.

730
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:03,142
The police is investigating.
- What can the police do?

731
01:07:03,484 --> 01:07:08,084
The goons who has such guts that
they can rape a girl, kill her. . .

732
01:07:08,209 --> 01:07:09,677
and then throw her body
on the railway tracks. . .

733
01:07:09,810 --> 01:07:11,404
cannot be the job
of small time goons.

734
01:07:11,652 --> 01:07:13,121
Even the police doesn't
touch such goons.

735
01:07:13,654 --> 01:07:14,622
You are right.

736
01:07:15,176 --> 01:07:19,139
Father, what is the matter?
You left home early today.

737
01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:25,627
You didn't even offer prayers.
- I didn't? Yes, I forgot.

738
01:07:26,187 --> 01:07:29,159
Go home now, mom has called you.

739
01:07:37,718 --> 01:07:42,183
Go and seek Master's blessings, son.
- Bless you.

740
01:07:43,204 --> 01:07:44,672
He's appearing for
his exams today.

741
01:07:44,885 --> 01:07:48,188
Parents blessings are more
than enough. Bless you.

742
01:07:48,489 --> 01:07:50,686
It is all thanks to you
he is getting an education.

743
01:07:51,212 --> 01:07:53,478
If it wasn't for you,
I wouldn't have got a job.

744
01:07:53,734 --> 01:07:58,199
Good I met you. Now he will surely
pass in his exams. Good day.

745
01:07:58,739 --> 01:08:03,113
You are aware that Mr. Rana has done
many jobs for the welfare of people.

746
01:08:03,264 --> 01:08:07,136
He always strives to do things in
the interest of the society & country.

747
01:08:07,268 --> 01:08:13,679
I request Mr. Rana to place his views
before you and begin the meeting.

748
01:08:22,243 --> 01:08:26,206
The worsening situation,
the terror of goons. . .

749
01:08:26,727 --> 01:08:29,699
and the common man
living in fear. . .

750
01:08:30,731 --> 01:08:33,202
that's the picture
this city portrays.

751
01:08:35,015 --> 01:08:41,222
People connected to the police
and administration are present here.

752
01:08:41,782 --> 01:08:44,754
But I don't feel the least bit of
hesitation in saying. . .

753
01:08:45,266 --> 01:08:48,727
that the situation
in the city is worsening.

754
01:08:50,791 --> 01:08:59,765
Whether home, workplace, or street,
a man does not feel safe anywhere.

755
01:09:01,802 --> 01:09:06,767
The state of affairs is such
that hooliganism. . .

756
01:09:07,808 --> 01:09:09,277
goes on in broad daylight.

757
01:09:09,810 --> 01:09:12,714
They don'tjust threaten
people and extort money.

758
01:09:13,774 --> 01:09:16,245
They just kill him and
snatch it.

759
01:09:17,258 --> 01:09:22,223
To eliminate these powers, every
police officer. . .

760
01:09:22,383 --> 01:09:24,250
will have to prepare for battle.

761
01:09:28,789 --> 01:09:32,251
Don't applaud!

762
01:09:33,314 --> 01:09:37,277
Don't listen to such
people and applaud. Don't!

763
01:09:37,798 --> 01:09:40,269
Open your eyes!
Realise!

764
01:09:41,802 --> 01:09:44,273
Leave me! I am the public,
and this is a public meeting.

765
01:09:44,805 --> 01:09:48,768
Listen! Leave him.
Come, Master.

766
01:09:50,851 --> 01:09:54,222
Come here and speak. You want to say
something? Come on stage and speak.

767
01:09:54,335 --> 01:09:59,300
Yes I want to speak. Because I am not
a part of this crowd of dummies.

768
01:10:01,342 --> 01:10:04,314
Mr. Rana is expressing remorse at the
worsening situation in the city.

769
01:10:04,865 --> 01:10:06,835
Master, speak in the mike.

770
01:10:08,389 --> 01:10:13,354
Mr. Rana is expressing remorse at the
worsening situation in the city.

771
01:10:13,874 --> 01:10:17,837
He is advising the police on how
to keep the hooligans in check.

772
01:10:17,998 --> 01:10:21,267
He stands on stage wearing a mask
of a social worker. . .

773
01:10:21,402 --> 01:10:22,870
and collecting applause.

774
01:10:23,003 --> 01:10:25,372
Which goons is he
talking of eliminating, Mr. Rana?

775
01:10:25,886 --> 01:10:27,355
You are the biggest goon of the city.

776
01:10:27,888 --> 01:10:28,856
Look!

777
01:10:29,930 --> 01:10:32,401
And he has the other goons
in his fold.

778
01:10:33,414 --> 01:10:36,386
And even the police has given
complete freedom to these goons.

779
01:10:36,937 --> 01:10:40,399
The police has accepted defeat
before your power and influence.

780
01:10:41,942 --> 01:10:49,322
The police always complains that no
man lodges a complain against goons. . .

781
01:10:49,470 --> 01:10:50,438
with the police.

782
01:10:50,951 --> 01:10:53,923
That there is no eye witness
to murder or looting.

783
01:10:54,074 --> 01:11:00,452
So today I, Sachdanand Agnihotri,
give the police an eye witness.

784
01:11:00,961 --> 01:11:05,426
The police has recovered a body on
the Mahim railway tracks last night.

785
01:11:05,766 --> 01:11:07,963
The girl's name was Bharati Salukhe.

786
01:11:08,489 --> 01:11:11,393
Some goons had picked up
this girl from Worli Naka.

787
01:11:11,932 --> 01:11:14,403
One of the goons among them
was Mr. Rana's son, Nagesh.

788
01:11:16,457 --> 01:11:19,429
I have myself seen Nagesh
pick that girl.

789
01:11:19,940 --> 01:11:22,309
I am the eye witness
of that incident.

790
01:11:22,463 --> 01:11:24,660
Will the police
investigate this case now?

791
01:11:24,945 --> 01:11:27,416
Answer me, Commissioner.

792
01:11:27,948 --> 01:11:30,647
What will you say? Your police
was with them in this crime.

793
01:11:30,951 --> 01:11:34,914
Will the police take action
on my evidence?

794
01:11:35,476 --> 01:11:39,439
This is a public meeting.
Answer me!

795
01:11:40,481 --> 01:11:42,451
Do you think before
doing anything or not?

796
01:11:44,485 --> 01:11:46,455
You picked up a girl
from the slums?

797
01:11:47,007 --> 01:11:48,977
Don't you have any standard?

798
01:11:50,491 --> 01:11:52,961
It's okay that guys like
you do such things.

799
01:11:53,494 --> 01:11:55,464
It's also okay that you killed her.

800
01:11:55,776 --> 01:11:58,976
But what is not okay
that her body was found.

801
01:11:59,540 --> 01:12:01,008
Instead of throwing her
on the railways tracks. . .

802
01:12:01,142 --> 01:12:02,735
couldn't you throw her in some gutter?

803
01:12:13,994 --> 01:12:19,961
Alright, forget what happened.
I have spoken to Kamble.

804
01:12:21,001 --> 01:12:25,966
He will manage everything.
Henceforth, be careful.

805
01:12:30,531 --> 01:12:33,503
Lankeshwar, is the
plot work going fine?

806
01:12:34,014 --> 01:12:36,485
Which plot?
- The Rana complex plot.

807
01:12:37,017 --> 01:12:38,987
That one? Yes, sir.

808
01:12:39,540 --> 01:12:43,001
What appointments do I have tomorrow
after my meeting with the commissioner?

809
01:12:43,304 --> 01:12:46,002
You have to go to
Gandhi Memorial school at 1 1 am.

810
01:12:46,307 --> 01:12:49,905
The kids that had died eating sweets
on the independence day function. . .

811
01:12:50,070 --> 01:12:51,539
you have to congratulate them.

812
01:12:51,672 --> 01:12:57,446
And in the evening, condole Dr. Patel
for the medical services he offers.

813
01:12:57,558 --> 01:12:59,528
What nonsense are you talking!

814
01:13:01,081 --> 01:13:05,546
I'm sorry, I messing things.
Actually, I am very upset.

815
01:13:05,686 --> 01:13:09,786
Why hide anything from you? My brother
has sent a letter again from Dhaulpur.

816
01:13:10,090 --> 01:13:12,391
He has asked about
the plot of land. . .

817
01:13:12,533 --> 01:13:14,001
Keep that to yourself!

818
01:13:14,535 --> 01:13:20,502
Gayatri, Vishal, look!
. . .Why are you staring at me?

819
01:13:20,821 --> 01:13:24,021
I am no more an ordinary teacher
who gets a pension of Rs.7 40.

820
01:13:24,545 --> 01:13:25,513
I am something more.

821
01:13:25,666 --> 01:13:28,034
Who says people don't
stand up for truth any more?

822
01:13:28,068 --> 01:13:30,631
Truth is important even today.

823
01:13:30,831 --> 01:13:33,028
See this! Everything has
come in the newspaper today.

824
01:13:33,594 --> 01:13:35,564
My picture has also been published.

825
01:13:36,076 --> 01:13:39,048
The newspapers have
exposed Jaspal Rana.

826
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:42,560
It won't be so easy for
him to save Nagesh now.

827
01:13:42,883 --> 01:13:44,819
Why are you so upset?

828
01:13:45,085 --> 01:13:47,386
What do you think?
That I have done something wrong?

829
01:13:47,488 --> 01:13:49,788
We didn't say that.

830
01:13:50,131 --> 01:13:52,101
But before doing anything,
you could have atleast spoken to me.

831
01:13:52,293 --> 01:13:54,091
Why should I? And even if
I had, what would you do?

832
01:13:54,615 --> 01:13:57,085
We could have atleast discussed. . .
- How would that help?

833
01:13:57,218 --> 01:13:59,882
The truth published in the newspaper
has reached the people.

834
01:14:00,141 --> 01:14:02,509
There must be some people
who's conscience is not dead yet.

835
01:14:03,144 --> 01:14:06,013
Those people will come on the
streets and demand Nagesh's arrest.

836
01:14:06,147 --> 01:14:08,117
And the police will be
forced to arrest Nagesh.

837
01:14:08,549 --> 01:14:10,610
You don't understand
- What will you explain to me?

838
01:14:10,871 --> 01:14:12,534
You have grown so big
that you will explain to me?

839
01:14:13,073 --> 01:14:14,542
You make him understand.

840
01:14:16,117 --> 01:14:18,086
Vishal, what is
done cannot be undone.

841
01:14:18,519 --> 01:14:21,081
Think of what we have to do now.
Atleast. . .

842
01:14:21,362 --> 01:14:24,060
You stop worrying about me.
I'll face what will come.

843
01:14:24,285 --> 01:14:25,878
I will fight my problems.

844
01:14:26,127 --> 01:14:29,098
What I have taken up, it is my
duty to carry them to their end.

845
01:14:30,411 --> 01:14:31,504
Trying to teach me!

846
01:14:31,612 --> 01:14:34,082
Wait for the day when
people will come on the streets.

847
01:15:12,133 --> 01:15:15,105
Try to understand my dilemma.

848
01:15:15,656 --> 01:15:20,621
Master is not alone today.
He has public support.

849
01:15:21,142 --> 01:15:24,114
People are abusing the police.

850
01:15:25,666 --> 01:15:27,636
Even the students
have got down to rioting.

851
01:15:28,669 --> 01:15:32,131
Yesterday, they burnt
police vehicles too.

852
01:15:32,673 --> 01:15:36,135
If this continues,
I'll lose my job.

853
01:15:37,678 --> 01:15:39,648
What do you want from me, Kamble?

854
01:15:40,601 --> 01:15:44,166
Look Mr. Rana, I have thought
a lot over it.

855
01:15:44,725 --> 01:15:47,093
If the situation
continues to worsen. . .

856
01:15:47,208 --> 01:15:51,171
even you will suffer heavily.

857
01:15:51,732 --> 01:15:54,203
There is only one
way you can stop all this.

858
01:15:56,737 --> 01:16:01,202
I. . . l. . . will have. . . to arrest Nagesh.

859
01:16:07,268 --> 01:16:09,238
First hear me out, Mr. Rana.

860
01:16:10,271 --> 01:16:13,175
Nagesh won't be in
police custody for long.

861
01:16:14,195 --> 01:16:15,663
Rest assured.

862
01:16:16,197 --> 01:16:20,661
Mr. Pradhan will fight Nagesh's case.

863
01:16:20,961 --> 01:16:24,662
It won't take me long to break
the charge sheet in court.

864
01:16:25,206 --> 01:16:30,171
I won't allow any witness
or evidence against Nagesh in court.

865
01:16:30,731 --> 01:16:32,200
Trust me.

866
01:16:32,733 --> 01:16:37,698
But I will be able to do all this,
only if I hold on to my post.

867
01:16:45,746 --> 01:16:51,213
Which means the police will drag
Nagesh like a dog.

868
01:16:52,793 --> 01:16:55,264
And tomorrow's headlines will be. . .

869
01:16:56,277 --> 01:17:00,741
'Social worker Jaspal Rana's son
arrested on charges of rape.'

870
01:17:04,285 --> 01:17:09,250
Alright, I will appoint Pradhan
as defence lawyer.

871
01:17:10,331 --> 01:17:12,733
Nagesh will also get released.

872
01:17:13,734 --> 01:17:17,105
But after this entire episode. . .

873
01:17:17,258 --> 01:17:20,230
what about all the work I have done?

874
01:17:21,262 --> 01:17:26,227
I have put in 25 years to build
this reputation, what about that?

875
01:17:35,276 --> 01:17:37,246
There is one solution, Kamble.

876
01:17:40,321 --> 01:17:42,791
You rascal!
Got hot pants?

877
01:17:43,324 --> 01:17:48,790
What have you done! Didn't you feel
ashamed to commit such a grave sin?

878
01:18:52,036 --> 01:18:54,506
Inspector, here's your culprit.

879
01:18:55,559 --> 01:18:58,030
He has committed a
heinous crime as rape.

880
01:18:58,322 --> 01:19:01,522
Treat him as an ordinary criminal.

881
01:19:02,326 --> 01:19:04,762
Forget that he is my son.

882
01:19:05,049 --> 01:19:08,453
He is not my son.
He cannot be my son!

883
01:19:12,016 --> 01:19:16,480
Mr. Rana, people use their position
to protect their friends & relatives.

884
01:19:16,780 --> 01:19:18,978
But you yourself handed your son
over to the police?

885
01:19:19,543 --> 01:19:20,910
It was necessary.

886
01:19:21,025 --> 01:19:25,990
Mr. Rana, you have done a great deed
by putting your son behind bars.

887
01:19:26,310 --> 01:19:30,512
Don't say that.
I have done no great thing.

888
01:19:31,035 --> 01:19:34,496
I have just done my duty.

889
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:39,501
When fingers were raised
on my son. . .

890
01:19:40,084 --> 01:19:42,554
I myself handed him
over to the police.

891
01:19:45,569 --> 01:19:49,532
I want it to set an
example for those boys. . .

892
01:19:50,094 --> 01:19:54,057
who commit crimes without fear
because of their father's position.

893
01:19:55,860 --> 01:20:02,066
It's not me, but Master Sachdanand
Agnihotri has done a greatjob.

894
01:20:02,626 --> 01:20:06,088
Who fearlessly raised his voice
against this injustice.

895
01:20:09,073 --> 01:20:12,443
Don't take my pictures, please!

896
01:20:12,556 --> 01:20:16,519
If you have to take pictures, take
Master's pictures and publish them.

897
01:20:17,561 --> 01:20:21,524
This truth loving man's
face must reach every home.

898
01:20:21,846 --> 01:20:25,046
After handing over Nagesh to the
police, will you. . .

899
01:20:26,090 --> 01:20:28,060
What I have done
is with my honesty.

900
01:20:30,094 --> 01:20:35,560
Now I want even the police department
also to do it's job diligently.

901
01:20:37,101 --> 01:20:38,968
Is Master home?
- You. . .

902
01:20:39,103 --> 01:20:42,564
Don't worry. We have
not come here to arrest him.

903
01:20:43,627 --> 01:20:45,597
We want his signatures
on some papers.

904
01:20:48,632 --> 01:20:50,101
Call Master.

905
01:20:58,162 --> 01:21:02,034
What is the matter? Why have you
come here at such a late hour?

906
01:21:02,166 --> 01:21:06,368
Sorry to bother you, but we
are helpless, ourjob is such.

907
01:21:06,690 --> 01:21:10,653
Why are you standing?
Sit down.

908
01:21:14,178 --> 01:21:18,642
The police investigation
in the rape case has begun.

909
01:21:20,184 --> 01:21:22,154
I am handling that case.

910
01:21:22,706 --> 01:21:25,576
The statement you gave,
on it's basis. . .

911
01:21:25,709 --> 01:21:27,679
the court will file a case in court.

912
01:21:28,712 --> 01:21:33,177
I need your signature.
- Where do I have to sign?

913
01:21:35,239 --> 01:21:39,703
Think again, Master.
This is a case of rape and murder

914
01:21:41,245 --> 01:21:45,117
Your signing the papers means
registering yourself. . .

915
01:21:45,249 --> 01:21:46,217
as an eye witness in the case.

916
01:21:47,251 --> 01:21:52,717
Maybe the investigation reaches
a stage where Nagesh is sentenced.

917
01:21:53,777 --> 01:21:56,749
But all this is not so easy.

918
01:21:57,781 --> 01:22:00,753
Because Nagesh
is Jaspal Rana's son. . .

919
01:22:01,785 --> 01:22:07,252
who has power
and is very influential.

920
01:22:07,551 --> 01:22:09,988
I have seen many cases. . .

921
01:22:10,234 --> 01:22:13,206
where the witness is
harassed so much. . .

922
01:22:13,517 --> 01:22:16,614
that they prefer
to leave the case. . .

923
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:19,732
but the police is
forced to hold on to them.

924
01:22:20,764 --> 01:22:23,736
I am only narrating my experience.

925
01:22:24,248 --> 01:22:27,709
Just a minute! Are you narrating
your experience, or scaring me?

926
01:22:29,253 --> 01:22:32,123
I spoke what I saw.
And I stick to my word.

927
01:22:32,256 --> 01:22:34,226
Tell me where I have to sign?

928
01:22:42,306 --> 01:22:44,776
Wait! Don't sign.

929
01:22:45,309 --> 01:22:48,179
I have a feeling we will
get into big trouble.

930
01:22:48,312 --> 01:22:51,773
Patil! Put that down!
Have you come here for an encounter?

931
01:22:52,837 --> 01:22:54,807
If you fire accidentally,
someone here will die.

932
01:22:58,843 --> 01:22:59,811
Sorry.

933
01:23:03,087 --> 01:23:06,025
No, please don't sign.
I am very scared.

934
01:23:06,330 --> 01:23:10,031
Gayatri, there is no need to worry.
No one can harm us.

935
01:23:10,294 --> 01:23:12,264
Those who have committed the crime
should be afraid.

936
01:23:12,376 --> 01:23:15,644
I know, but please don't sign.
Even Vishal is not home. . .

937
01:23:15,779 --> 01:23:17,749
What will Vishal do?
He cannot stop me from signing.

938
01:23:18,782 --> 01:23:22,745
Yet, please don't. . .
- Don't talk nonsense!

939
01:23:29,313 --> 01:23:30,679
What is the matter, mom?

940
01:23:30,835 --> 01:23:33,305
They have come to take
your father's statement.

941
01:23:33,838 --> 01:23:36,810
Stop him from signing.
I have a strange fear in me.

942
01:23:38,322 --> 01:23:41,294
He cannot stop me.
I will not back out.

943
01:23:41,605 --> 01:23:43,803
And instead of telling me anything,
make your mother understand.

944
01:23:44,128 --> 01:23:48,068
Don't I have anything else in life
other than wiping your mother's tears?

945
01:23:48,372 --> 01:23:50,342
Do you have any respect for me?

946
01:23:50,855 --> 01:23:53,827
Have I ever hurt you two
to make myself happy?

947
01:23:54,378 --> 01:23:57,840
Haven't I fulfilled my
responsibilities as a father & husband?

948
01:23:58,382 --> 01:24:00,853
Don't I have a right over
my views, my decision?

949
01:24:01,385 --> 01:24:08,298
My ego is my only wealth. Do you want
me to surrender it before those goons?

950
01:24:54,189 --> 01:24:55,658
Vishal, you? Over here?

951
01:25:00,235 --> 01:25:04,198
Mom, she. . . But you don't
take any hasty decision.

952
01:25:04,319 --> 01:25:06,414
If you don't like her,
I'll get another girl next Monday.

953
01:25:08,243 --> 01:25:12,206
No, she is the one.
That's how I'd imagined her to be.

954
01:25:13,248 --> 01:25:14,216
What is your name, dear?

955
01:25:15,250 --> 01:25:16,218
Say it loudly

956
01:25:18,173 --> 01:25:21,635
One who sees you, will not
be able to take his eyes off.

957
01:25:22,698 --> 01:25:24,668
Now will you seek my blessings
if he tells you?

958
01:25:27,222 --> 01:25:28,190
Bless you.

959
01:25:53,769 --> 01:25:55,739
''Look, my heart pounds''

960
01:25:57,532 --> 01:25:59,468
''Look, my eyes flutter''

961
01:26:12,307 --> 01:26:15,769
''A fire smolders in my breath''

962
01:26:23,759 --> 01:26:26,731
''It steals my sleep,
puts me in a daze''

963
01:26:27,242 --> 01:26:29,713
''Her style is unique''

964
01:26:30,285 --> 01:26:32,255
''The Punjabi girl floors me''

965
01:26:38,293 --> 01:26:41,755
''Look. How rudely. . .''

966
01:26:42,297 --> 01:26:45,759
''he talks to me,
holding my hand''

967
01:26:53,308 --> 01:26:56,770
''He troubles me,
tries every way to woo me''

968
01:26:57,072 --> 01:26:59,008
''He teases me''

969
01:26:59,314 --> 01:27:02,286
''The Punjabi boy floors me''

970
01:27:21,296 --> 01:27:24,758
''She presses her
finger between her lips''

971
01:27:25,300 --> 01:27:28,170
''She smiles and makes me go crazy''

972
01:27:28,704 --> 01:27:32,006
''Why are you crazy about my style?''

973
01:27:32,307 --> 01:27:35,279
''Why do you sigh over me?''

974
01:27:35,831 --> 01:27:39,292
''Your cheeks are rosy,
your gait mesmerizing''

975
01:27:39,835 --> 01:27:41,805
''When I see her, I'm awed''

976
01:27:42,357 --> 01:27:44,828
''The Punjabi boy. . .''

977
01:28:28,123 --> 01:28:31,061
''Don't touch me after
trying to melt my heart''

978
01:28:31,366 --> 01:28:34,828
''Oh no, I'm too smart''

979
01:28:35,170 --> 01:28:38,336
''She speaks so curtly''

980
01:28:38,894 --> 01:28:41,866
''And walks like a slithering snake''

981
01:28:42,417 --> 01:28:45,389
''He's mad, he's after me''

982
01:28:45,901 --> 01:28:48,371
''He's desperate to get me''

983
01:28:48,904 --> 01:28:51,374
''The Punjabi boy. . .''

984
01:29:47,643 --> 01:29:50,945
Vishal has not come yet.
- He has been told.

985
01:29:51,486 --> 01:29:52,955
He must be on his way.
Here, drink water.

986
01:29:53,488 --> 01:29:55,686
I don't want water, I am fine.

987
01:29:55,971 --> 01:29:57,941
Don't worry, Vishal will go to the
police station as soon as he comes.

988
01:29:58,093 --> 01:29:59,960
But they picked him
when he was eating.

989
01:30:00,495 --> 01:30:02,864
He was eating after
a day and a half.

990
01:30:02,978 --> 01:30:06,941
I'll go to the police station.
I'll have to go.

991
01:30:07,983 --> 01:30:13,950
Wonder where Vishal is.
I only will go.

992
01:30:18,473 --> 01:30:20,671
The police picked up your father.
- I know, mom.

993
01:30:20,876 --> 01:30:22,435
He has not eaten a morsel
since a day and a half.

994
01:30:22,557 --> 01:30:24,824
Just because he gave evidence,
he has put himself into trouble.

995
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:28,421
Don't worry, I'll bring father home.
- Go soon.

996
01:30:32,487 --> 01:30:36,952
Master, this is the preparation
for the court's first hearing.

997
01:30:37,492 --> 01:30:42,457
In law, one has to say and write
the same things many times.

998
01:30:42,618 --> 01:30:47,720
Write what? I have said that whenever
the police wants me, I will come.

999
01:30:48,023 --> 01:30:50,220
Why is the same thing
being repeated?

1000
01:30:50,505 --> 01:30:54,468
Master, it is in your interest.

1001
01:30:55,030 --> 01:31:00,234
It is possible you may fall sick, you
may not be fit on some hearing date.

1002
01:31:00,555 --> 01:31:03,322
Don't show me sympathy.
Concentrate on your investigation.

1003
01:31:03,558 --> 01:31:06,029
Get them made again,
then I'll sign them.

1004
01:31:06,561 --> 01:31:07,928
Are you alright, father?
- Yes, I am fine.

1005
01:31:08,043 --> 01:31:11,243
What way is this? How could you
bring my father here like this?

1006
01:31:11,566 --> 01:31:13,935
We are only doing our duty.
- What duty?

1007
01:31:14,049 --> 01:31:16,417
You barge into a witness' house
anytime, pick him up. . .

1008
01:31:16,571 --> 01:31:20,534
And then this statement.
When will this drama stop?

1009
01:31:21,576 --> 01:31:24,047
This will continue
until the court's verdict.

1010
01:31:27,102 --> 01:31:31,566
And this is not drama,
it is the law's working.

1011
01:31:31,707 --> 01:31:33,073
Inspector. . .
- Keep quiet.

1012
01:31:33,588 --> 01:31:35,558
You are right.
I understand your position.

1013
01:31:35,871 --> 01:31:38,569
You should have thought of all this
before getting involved.

1014
01:31:39,114 --> 01:31:41,813
He is old, a little crazy.

1015
01:31:42,117 --> 01:31:44,987
Inspector!
- Don't shout!

1016
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:48,388
It is you who is being rude. Is this
the way to talk to an elderly man?

1017
01:31:48,644 --> 01:31:50,510
What will you do?
Put me behind bars?

1018
01:31:50,646 --> 01:31:52,114
Vishal!
- Father, wait!

1019
01:31:52,247 --> 01:31:54,012
I will carry forward
this investigation.

1020
01:31:54,129 --> 01:31:56,099
You are too proud of
your uniform, aren't you?

1021
01:31:56,652 --> 01:32:00,113
It is not your fault, he has
gone crazy. . . You come with me!

1022
01:32:01,176 --> 01:32:02,144
Come!

1023
01:32:05,661 --> 01:32:08,633
It's over.
You vented your anger on him.

1024
01:32:08,784 --> 01:32:11,152
You think I enjoyed slapping him?

1025
01:32:11,667 --> 01:32:14,639
Ask him why he created a situation
where I had to slap him.

1026
01:32:14,950 --> 01:32:17,580
He actually got down to
fisticuffs with the police.

1027
01:32:18,113 --> 01:32:21,814
What wrong did I do? They
were forcing you to sign papers.

1028
01:32:22,037 --> 01:32:24,599
You were eating,
and they just came and picked you?

1029
01:32:25,160 --> 01:32:27,528
But your behavior
in the police station?

1030
01:32:27,643 --> 01:32:32,107
What was wrong about it? You were
being humiliated, which I couldn't bear.

1031
01:32:32,648 --> 01:32:35,118
If anything had happened today,
what would happen after that?

1032
01:32:35,651 --> 01:32:38,623
Do you know the meaning of hitting
the police in the police station?

1033
01:32:39,174 --> 01:32:41,041
Do you think before doing anything?

1034
01:32:41,176 --> 01:32:43,146
Where do you think?

1035
01:32:43,699 --> 01:32:47,160
Did you think before
going against that Rana?

1036
01:32:47,703 --> 01:32:52,406
Did you think before signing the
statement about the incident you saw?

1037
01:32:52,708 --> 01:32:55,680
Did you think what problems
your family could get into?

1038
01:32:56,191 --> 01:32:59,459
Did you think?
- Vishal, keep quiet, and leave!

1039
01:33:08,724 --> 01:33:17,197
I have realized today
that Vishal is a big boy now.

1040
01:33:19,695 --> 01:33:26,072
Nagesh. . . son. . .
- Don't call me son!

1041
01:33:26,181 --> 01:33:30,144
Your son is dead. You killed him
to save your reputation.

1042
01:33:30,706 --> 01:33:34,167
Stop your nonsense!
I have done nothing wrong.

1043
01:33:34,990 --> 01:33:38,691
If I had not done that, I wouldn't
have this position to save you today.

1044
01:33:39,715 --> 01:33:41,479
One can do
everything with position.

1045
01:33:43,719 --> 01:33:46,485
I can play any game now.

1046
01:33:48,003 --> 01:33:50,200
You won't be in
the lock-up for very long.

1047
01:33:50,766 --> 01:33:54,729
You know Pradhan.
He has never lost a case.

1048
01:33:55,250 --> 01:33:56,719
He is returning from America today.

1049
01:34:04,780 --> 01:34:09,745
Pradhan, see this case differently.

1050
01:34:10,305 --> 01:34:13,767
The verdict should come within 2-3
hearings, in our favour.

1051
01:34:15,310 --> 01:34:20,218
The longer my son in jail, the
more trouble I'll put everyone into.

1052
01:34:21,236 --> 01:34:24,208
What appeal you make when. . .

1053
01:34:24,519 --> 01:34:30,726
and how, is all your look out.

1054
01:34:36,772 --> 01:34:40,233
Mr. Rana, even I am
upset about Nagesh.

1055
01:34:41,296 --> 01:34:44,268
He is like my son.

1056
01:34:44,780 --> 01:34:46,750
I will clear this case very soon.

1057
01:34:48,784 --> 01:34:51,756
And anyway, people don't
see in this city.

1058
01:34:52,788 --> 01:34:55,760
If they do,
they don't speak about it

1059
01:34:56,311 --> 01:35:00,274
This is the first man
who sees and also talks.

1060
01:35:01,837 --> 01:35:06,802
Mr. Rana, just do
what I am telling you.

1061
01:35:08,644 --> 01:35:13,312
Master Sachdanand is a
straight, honest, truthful man.

1062
01:35:14,850 --> 01:35:17,754
And most important,
he thinks with his heart.

1063
01:35:20,776 --> 01:35:27,746
One who thinks with his heart,
you must hurt his brain.

1064
01:35:30,826 --> 01:35:32,796
Why did you fire?
- I didn't.

1065
01:35:32,908 --> 01:35:36,278
Then why did the pigeons fly away?
- How do I know?

1066
01:35:38,113 --> 01:35:40,310
Please look after yourself.

1067
01:35:44,840 --> 01:35:51,810
After examining your mother, I feel
she will need regular treatment now.

1068
01:35:52,848 --> 01:35:55,820
We'll know other details
after the report comes in.

1069
01:35:56,371 --> 01:36:00,334
Give these medicines to her
regularly. I'll be going.

1070
01:36:06,902 --> 01:36:08,370
Master, take oblation.

1071
01:36:14,910 --> 01:36:16,880
Why did you give me a scorpion
instead of oblation?

1072
01:36:17,392 --> 01:36:19,693
Did you notice? The priest gave me
a scorpion instead of oblation.

1073
01:36:19,835 --> 01:36:22,305
What are you saying! There
is oblation fallen on the floor.

1074
01:36:29,364 --> 01:36:31,835
One medicine is out of stock.
Rs. 140 for these.

1075
01:36:43,378 --> 01:36:46,350
Master, why don't you understand?

1076
01:36:46,902 --> 01:36:48,872
Legal work has to be done
in a legal way.

1077
01:36:49,384 --> 01:36:54,851
I understand, I am educated.
But the way you are troubling me. . .

1078
01:36:58,433 --> 01:37:02,898
You are helping us.
Then why will we want to trouble you?

1079
01:37:03,118 --> 01:37:07,388
And one needs courage
to do what you have done.

1080
01:37:08,203 --> 01:37:11,904
But before taking the brave step,
did you think about it?

1081
01:37:15,971 --> 01:37:18,772
What are you doing?
- We'll escort you home.

1082
01:37:18,894 --> 01:37:21,866
Why are you taking me through
the back door?

1083
01:37:22,417 --> 01:37:24,888
You don't need to escort me home,
I'll manage.

1084
01:37:37,432 --> 01:37:40,894
Why are you drinking and driving?
- Who is drunk, Master?

1085
01:37:41,436 --> 01:37:42,905
I don't drink.

1086
01:37:47,442 --> 01:37:50,414
Why are you driving reverse?
- I am driving straight.

1087
01:37:50,565 --> 01:37:51,932
Drive ahead!

1088
01:37:53,769 --> 01:37:55,739
Drop me off here, I'll manage.

1089
01:37:55,971 --> 01:37:58,943
No Master, it is our
duty to drop you home.

1090
01:38:01,977 --> 01:38:06,441
Here, you are home.
- You were unnecessarily worried.

1091
01:38:11,987 --> 01:38:14,184
Get off, your home has arrived.

1092
01:38:34,489 --> 01:38:37,461
The problems at home
are ruining my mother's health.

1093
01:38:38,774 --> 01:38:41,974
When I think of father,
even he is not wrong.

1094
01:38:42,497 --> 01:38:46,962
But there are no people in the
police or law who support the truth.

1095
01:38:47,502 --> 01:38:50,873
But father's faith. . .
- I'm sure he will understand. . .

1096
01:38:51,026 --> 01:38:52,221
if you convince him, Vishal.

1097
01:38:53,028 --> 01:38:56,000
What he did for the
sake of humanity is okay.

1098
01:38:56,511 --> 01:39:01,978
Now let the law decide who the culprit
is and what punishment he should get.

1099
01:39:02,517 --> 01:39:04,487
It is theirjob.

1100
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:09,003
If every man did his job diligently,
this situation wouldn't arise.

1101
01:39:09,324 --> 01:39:12,524
A man who is honest
is being troubled.

1102
01:39:14,049 --> 01:39:16,019
I am surrounded by many questions.

1103
01:39:16,571 --> 01:39:18,473
On one hand is mom's
deteriorating health.

1104
01:39:20,015 --> 01:39:22,485
Wonder what turn father's
fight is going to take.

1105
01:39:28,503 --> 01:39:33,468
Your honour, before arguing on the
charge sheet against Nagesh Rana. . .

1106
01:39:34,029 --> 01:39:37,001
I want to throw light
on the basis of this case.

1107
01:39:38,553 --> 01:39:43,018
An NGO, to discuss the
rising crime rate in the city. . .

1108
01:39:44,039 --> 01:39:46,009
organizes a meeting at Cross Maidan. . .

1109
01:39:46,161 --> 01:39:50,033
which is attended by top officers of
the police, social workers. . .

1110
01:39:50,565 --> 01:39:54,528
and also the Press.

1111
01:39:55,090 --> 01:39:59,554
Mr. Jaspal Rana is invited as
chief guest for the meeting.

1112
01:40:01,096 --> 01:40:04,968
When he is on stage
and giving a speech. . .

1113
01:40:05,100 --> 01:40:11,067
a man comes there like a
film hero and accuses Mr. Rana.

1114
01:40:11,627 --> 01:40:13,824
He blames him for the
rising crime in the city.

1115
01:40:14,109 --> 01:40:22,024
To the extent, that he accuses
his son, Nagesh of rape and murder.

1116
01:40:24,079 --> 01:40:30,046
He says he has seen Nagesh
and his friends pick a girl.

1117
01:40:32,087 --> 01:40:37,553
Master Sachdanand staged
this drama on the stage.

1118
01:40:40,616 --> 01:40:45,580
But it has to be cleared before
the court. . .

1119
01:40:45,701 --> 01:40:49,071
whether an incident
has actually occurred or not.

1120
01:40:49,625 --> 01:40:56,594
At 1 1 pm, on Worli Naka, where
thousands of people are around. . .

1121
01:40:56,912 --> 01:41:02,116
since there is a taxi stand on the
left, a theater & hospital on the right.

1122
01:41:02,237 --> 01:41:07,111
In such an atmosphere, some goons
forcibly put a girl in a jeep.

1123
01:41:08,163 --> 01:41:13,937
None of the people present there
hear her screams, except Master.

1124
01:41:14,169 --> 01:41:17,631
Only he saw this scene.

1125
01:41:18,173 --> 01:41:23,138
But he didn't lodge any complaint
in any police station.

1126
01:41:25,180 --> 01:41:31,147
Maybe at that time he saw
the police helping Nagesh.

1127
01:41:32,187 --> 01:41:37,152
Master took a wise decision.

1128
01:41:39,234 --> 01:41:40,703
And like a common man. . .

1129
01:41:40,836 --> 01:41:44,206
considered it better to keep
himself away from the incident.

1130
01:41:45,240 --> 01:41:50,707
But the next day, at Cross Maiden,
his other facet came forward.

1131
01:41:52,247 --> 01:41:57,451
A man who stops himself
from going to the police station. . .

1132
01:41:57,773 --> 01:42:03,740
snatches the mike from Jaspal Rana
in the presence of thousands of people?

1133
01:42:04,259 --> 01:42:07,721
I didn't snatch it.
Jaspal Rana gave it to me.

1134
01:42:08,664 --> 01:42:11,226
And this incident happened
a little away from Worli Naka.

1135
01:42:12,267 --> 01:42:18,679
Your honour, there are some old
buildings to the left of the theater.

1136
01:42:19,715 --> 01:42:21,685
The girl was brought
from those buildings.

1137
01:42:22,237 --> 01:42:26,109
I am speaking the truth.
Whatever the circumstances. . .

1138
01:42:26,241 --> 01:42:28,211
I have never lied.

1139
01:42:31,246 --> 01:42:36,120
My Lord, I request permission
to cross examine Master.

1140
01:42:36,251 --> 01:42:37,219
Permission granted.

1141
01:42:41,056 --> 01:42:45,258
Master, as a teacher, how many
years did you spend in a school?

1142
01:42:47,302 --> 01:42:50,274
About 1 1 years in Poornima school.

1143
01:42:51,306 --> 01:42:53,777
Did you teach in any
other school before that?

1144
01:42:54,309 --> 01:42:57,281
Yes, I taught in a government
school for four years.

1145
01:42:57,793 --> 01:42:59,763
Why four years?

1146
01:43:00,315 --> 01:43:01,784
How is this question
connected to this case?

1147
01:43:01,917 --> 01:43:03,283
It's a personal matter.

1148
01:43:03,398 --> 01:43:06,667
What has the court got to do
with when and why I quit a job.

1149
01:43:06,842 --> 01:43:10,805
You just answer the questions.
Leave the court's join to the court.

1150
01:43:12,327 --> 01:43:15,197
This is notjust a case where
the life of a youth is involved.

1151
01:43:15,330 --> 01:43:18,735
Even the reputation of a
renowned social worker is at stake.

1152
01:43:18,894 --> 01:43:23,267
It will be better if you
answer my questions patiently.

1153
01:43:25,300 --> 01:43:29,765
I will prove that my every question
is connected to this case.

1154
01:43:34,309 --> 01:43:40,276
Now tell me, why did you work for
only 4 years in a government school?

1155
01:43:44,319 --> 01:43:48,282
Because as a teacher, it was
embarrassing for me to see. . .

1156
01:43:48,443 --> 01:43:49,810
what was happening there.

1157
01:43:51,366 --> 01:43:55,329
The teachers there had
made education a business.

1158
01:43:56,371 --> 01:43:59,833
They had opened
shop outside the school. . .

1159
01:44:00,375 --> 01:44:02,846
and forced
students to take tuitions.

1160
01:44:03,859 --> 01:44:08,323
When I protested,
I was troubled in many ways.

1161
01:44:08,463 --> 01:44:10,832
Sick of it all, I resigned.

1162
01:44:10,986 --> 01:44:14,858
Why did you quit Poornima school
after 1 1 years of service?

1163
01:44:16,912 --> 01:44:19,816
I had a problem
with the principal there.

1164
01:44:21,356 --> 01:44:25,228
It was difficult to save
my honour even there.

1165
01:44:25,360 --> 01:44:28,560
But this time, you didn't resign,
you were dismissed.

1166
01:44:29,845 --> 01:44:32,817
Yes, you can say that.

1167
01:44:33,128 --> 01:44:34,528
As per the school report. . .

1168
01:44:34,730 --> 01:44:38,328
you were irresponsible and
careless about your work.

1169
01:44:38,894 --> 01:44:43,358
For example,
you never gave the Hindi lecture.

1170
01:44:43,899 --> 01:44:45,869
That happened only once.

1171
01:44:46,782 --> 01:44:50,084
And I wasn't doing anything wrong
missing from class.

1172
01:44:50,385 --> 01:44:54,257
I'd gone to the peon's house.
He was very sick.

1173
01:44:54,389 --> 01:44:56,256
There was no one to look after him.

1174
01:44:56,391 --> 01:44:58,258
So I had given him some medicines.

1175
01:44:58,433 --> 01:45:00,904
And again, it also happened that
you left class. . .

1176
01:45:01,036 --> 01:45:06,308
barged into the accounts department
got into a tiff with the head clerk. . .

1177
01:45:06,441 --> 01:45:08,411
and you beat him up.

1178
01:45:09,444 --> 01:45:11,414
Yes, that had happened.

1179
01:45:11,727 --> 01:45:13,663
Because there was misappropriation
of Rs.500000. . .

1180
01:45:13,809 --> 01:45:16,906
in the fund received from
the trust for school maintenance.

1181
01:45:17,452 --> 01:45:20,356
And this money had been shared
with others along with the principal.

1182
01:45:20,896 --> 01:45:24,357
The head clerk had a major hand
in this entire episode.

1183
01:45:24,660 --> 01:45:26,857
When I hit him, he was drunk.

1184
01:45:27,422 --> 01:45:30,884
A school employee
came to work drunk.

1185
01:45:31,426 --> 01:45:32,895
If I hit him,
what wrong did I do?

1186
01:45:33,028 --> 01:45:35,898
Should even I have
turned a blind eye like others?

1187
01:45:36,431 --> 01:45:40,896
Don't get upset Mr. Agnihotri.
- I am being troubled.

1188
01:45:42,437 --> 01:45:47,141
The thoughts that trouble me,
that I want to forget about. . .

1189
01:45:47,442 --> 01:45:48,410
in court, the same things. . .

1190
01:45:49,965 --> 01:45:53,426
Let me tell you, I am being
troubled even outside court.

1191
01:45:53,609 --> 01:45:56,911
My Lord, they are trying to shake up
my mental balance. . .

1192
01:45:57,452 --> 01:46:01,415
A game is being played
with me since some days.

1193
01:46:02,457 --> 01:46:09,427
When I feed pigeons, my
security guard fires a shot at them.

1194
01:46:11,506 --> 01:46:15,469
The police takes me in the police
station through the back door.

1195
01:46:16,992 --> 01:46:21,399
When I am escorted home,
the jeep is drove reverse.

1196
01:46:22,958 --> 01:46:29,426
When I ask for oblation from the
priest, a scorpion is placed in my hand

1197
01:46:30,445 --> 01:46:33,907
A game is being
played with me, My Lord.

1198
01:46:39,494 --> 01:46:42,466
What were you trying to say?

1199
01:46:42,577 --> 01:46:45,948
All that didn't make sense.
That's a court, father.

1200
01:46:46,261 --> 01:46:48,960
They twist everything you say.

1201
01:46:49,504 --> 01:46:52,966
You made a joke of yourself.
- Not me, of truth.

1202
01:46:53,508 --> 01:46:55,478
What I said actually
happened with me.

1203
01:46:55,791 --> 01:46:57,225
I am not mad.

1204
01:46:57,512 --> 01:47:00,974
Whatever I said was right.
All the details I gave were correct.

1205
01:47:01,116 --> 01:47:05,489
The case against the school
management ran for over two years.

1206
01:47:06,041 --> 01:47:08,011
The judgment was given
on 13th April in my favour.

1207
01:47:08,323 --> 01:47:10,920
Justice B. K Chaudhary was the judge.
I am not mad.

1208
01:47:11,046 --> 01:47:14,918
You were born on a Saturday
at 2:37 pm.

1209
01:47:15,050 --> 01:47:18,352
The same day when your mom's
brother got married. Am I right?

1210
01:47:18,493 --> 01:47:19,461
Yes.

1211
01:47:20,495 --> 01:47:25,460
You failed your
Math exam in 10th, remember?

1212
01:47:26,021 --> 01:47:29,482
I remember everything.
I keep all papers. Look!

1213
01:47:31,026 --> 01:47:31,994
Liquor bottle?

1214
01:47:49,044 --> 01:47:54,009
What I spoke in
court could be rubbish.

1215
01:47:55,570 --> 01:48:00,035
Maybe age has made me go senile.

1216
01:48:01,576 --> 01:48:04,548
But it is not possible
that I have started drinking?

1217
01:48:05,580 --> 01:48:09,543
This bottle was placed
in my bag to trouble me.

1218
01:48:10,585 --> 01:48:14,047
You don't have to say
anything more now, father.

1219
01:48:38,573 --> 01:48:40,543
Wait! You cannot go in.
- He is with me.

1220
01:48:41,096 --> 01:48:42,064
You cannot go in.

1221
01:48:47,623 --> 01:48:49,991
You were forbidden from coming in.
- ACP. . .

1222
01:48:50,105 --> 01:48:51,073
Father!

1223
01:48:53,629 --> 01:48:57,398
Now everything will
be done in my presence.

1224
01:48:57,633 --> 01:49:02,097
What he's asked,
what he's made to sign, everything!

1225
01:49:44,640 --> 01:49:46,108
Inspector, weren't you
the one. . .

1226
01:49:46,241 --> 01:49:48,404
who gave the bag to my
father outside court that day?

1227
01:49:48,644 --> 01:49:50,112
Yes.

1228
01:49:50,245 --> 01:49:52,408
Then you only must have put
that liquor bottle in it.

1229
01:49:52,688 --> 01:49:54,156
What are you trying to say?

1230
01:49:54,690 --> 01:49:57,662
That you placed that
liquor bottle in the bag.

1231
01:50:08,704 --> 01:50:10,172
Vishal, stop!

1232
01:50:12,227 --> 01:50:14,197
Leave me!

1233
01:50:53,709 --> 01:50:57,079
Look, it's difficult for
Vishal to be released soon.

1234
01:50:57,232 --> 01:51:00,694
The case is in a mess.
He has beaten the police.

1235
01:51:02,557 --> 01:51:05,724
Atleast try.
- I'll do that.

1236
01:51:05,841 --> 01:51:07,434
But the chances are very few.

1237
01:51:09,004 --> 01:51:12,944
Sir, my name is Sachdanand Agnihotri.
My case is in your court.

1238
01:51:13,248 --> 01:51:16,516
I am the state witness.
I have helped the police.

1239
01:51:16,772 --> 01:51:20,735
But some people have put my son
behind bars on fake murder charges.

1240
01:51:20,776 --> 01:51:22,142
Just accept his bail application.

1241
01:51:22,297 --> 01:51:24,494
Then let his case also run
in court, I don't mind.

1242
01:51:24,780 --> 01:51:26,476
I'll be highly obliged.

1243
01:51:26,782 --> 01:51:30,745
I cannot help you in this matter. We
don't interfere in police investigation

1244
01:51:31,787 --> 01:51:33,255
Sir, listen to me. . .

1245
01:51:44,840 --> 01:51:48,803
Don't tell me how much you have
broken the witness in this date.

1246
01:51:49,845 --> 01:51:52,817
My son has been in
the lock-up since 13 days.

1247
01:51:54,850 --> 01:51:57,320
The burden on my
conscience is killing me.

1248
01:51:57,853 --> 01:52:00,323
Because I only thrashed him
and took him to the police station.

1249
01:52:02,377 --> 01:52:05,349
This petty school teacher. . .

1250
01:52:05,861 --> 01:52:08,731
a government slave who draws
a salary of Rs.2000 a month. . .

1251
01:52:08,864 --> 01:52:10,332
is becoming a thorn in my side?

1252
01:52:10,866 --> 01:52:12,334
Jaspal Rana's side?

1253
01:52:13,869 --> 01:52:17,330
He has become the eye witness
to the kidnapping of a girl.

1254
01:52:17,873 --> 01:52:20,275
Despite knowing
my son had picked her?

1255
01:52:20,836 --> 01:52:22,304
A petty Master!

1256
01:52:24,840 --> 01:52:29,304
A petty Master,
is an eye witness. . .

1257
01:52:30,365 --> 01:52:32,335
who witnessed all this himself.

1258
01:52:38,854 --> 01:52:43,819
Kamble, remove Nagesh
from the lock-up for two hours.

1259
01:52:44,860 --> 01:52:48,823
And only your trusted men
should know this.

1260
01:52:50,666 --> 01:52:54,868
For tonight,
remove Master's security cover.

1261
01:52:55,911 --> 01:52:58,381
Will you tell me what you are up to?

1262
01:52:59,394 --> 01:53:05,100
Now this case will be over
in the next hearing.

1263
01:53:06,922 --> 01:53:09,894
This Master has a habit of
speaking out what he sees.

1264
01:53:11,446 --> 01:53:17,413
What I show him, will be very
difficult for him to repeat in court.

1265
01:54:29,444 --> 01:54:31,915
Mom, drink milk.
You have to take medicines too.

1266
01:54:32,167 --> 01:54:34,433
No dear, how many more
medicines will you give me?

1267
01:54:35,450 --> 01:54:36,919
I am not so sick.

1268
01:54:38,253 --> 01:54:40,450
It is five days since I saw Vishal.

1269
01:54:41,977 --> 01:54:44,949
What do the lawyers say?
When will he be released?

1270
01:54:45,260 --> 01:54:48,961
We are trying our best to get
him released at the earliest.

1271
01:54:49,264 --> 01:54:53,466
We have even appealed in court.
He will be released soon.

1272
01:54:54,790 --> 01:54:57,956
It is so late,
even my husband has not returned yet.

1273
01:55:11,526 --> 01:55:15,489
What happened?
- Hello.

1274
01:55:16,051 --> 01:55:17,019
Greetings, father.

1275
01:55:18,974 --> 01:55:20,944
How are you, dear?
- I'm fine.

1276
01:55:25,500 --> 01:55:28,962
What is the matter?
Something again. . .

1277
01:55:30,025 --> 01:55:32,997
No, it's nothing.

1278
01:55:35,030 --> 01:55:38,491
I wasn't doing anything important
at such a late hour.

1279
01:55:40,035 --> 01:55:45,000
I was sitting in the garden.
I didn't realize when I fell asleep.

1280
01:55:45,320 --> 01:55:48,520
You didn't realize
when you fell asleep?

1281
01:55:49,324 --> 01:55:55,530
Don't worry,
all this will end very soon.

1282
01:56:01,056 --> 01:56:02,524
We have a court hearing tomorrow.

1283
01:56:20,834 --> 01:56:23,806
You will be released soon.

1284
01:56:25,839 --> 01:56:30,303
I met the judge at his bungalow.

1285
01:56:32,846 --> 01:56:34,314
He is a very nice man.

1286
01:56:41,374 --> 01:56:43,845
My case verdict will come today.

1287
01:56:45,899 --> 01:56:51,365
Then I will do everything possible
to get you out on bail.

1288
01:56:52,906 --> 01:56:56,869
I know a few good lawyers now.

1289
01:56:58,912 --> 01:57:01,382
I will appoint a good lawyer
to fight your case.

1290
01:57:06,920 --> 01:57:11,384
You used to play with my
watch when young.

1291
01:57:14,968 --> 01:57:17,439
I had even recovered it
from your school bag one day.

1292
01:57:17,971 --> 01:57:21,877
Remember I had slapped you for it?

1293
01:57:26,900 --> 01:57:33,368
Since the past some days, this
watch has become lifeless for me.

1294
01:57:35,188 --> 01:57:41,394
I am not able to
catch up with its movement.

1295
01:57:42,956 --> 01:57:49,425
So you keep it.

1296
01:57:50,964 --> 01:57:54,927
Maybe you can catch up with it.

1297
01:58:22,086 --> 01:58:27,051
Master, are you mentally
prepared for the court case today?

1298
01:58:27,612 --> 01:58:32,520
I am fit and also ready.
Begin the proceedings.

1299
01:58:36,060 --> 01:58:37,927
Here is the report
of the panel of doctors.

1300
01:58:38,062 --> 01:58:41,524
I will talk about it later.

1301
01:58:43,588 --> 01:58:51,058
It cannot be denied that a witness
is put to a lot of trouble in a case.

1302
01:58:52,597 --> 01:58:55,569
So that the court doesn't
do injustice. . .

1303
01:58:56,080 --> 01:58:59,542
some matters have to
be repeated in court.

1304
01:59:01,125 --> 01:59:05,088
Even I feel sad seeing tension
on the face of a teacher. . .

1305
01:59:05,209 --> 01:59:07,076
standing in the witness box.

1306
01:59:11,135 --> 01:59:15,600
Your honour, a teacher holds
an important place in my life.

1307
01:59:16,621 --> 01:59:20,584
I was very naughty when young, and
it was a teacher who had reformed me.

1308
01:59:21,145 --> 01:59:25,108
That teacher steered me to the
right path, that is why today. . .

1309
01:59:25,309 --> 01:59:28,110
I respect every teacher.

1310
01:59:30,114 --> 01:59:36,081
Being a man of law,
I am trying to protect law.

1311
01:59:36,360 --> 01:59:41,064
On one hand, I am happy,
and on the other, I regret. . .

1312
01:59:42,126 --> 01:59:46,591
that in this attempt,
a teacher is being put to trouble.

1313
01:59:50,895 --> 01:59:56,601
So Master, I am placing before
the court what you saw, again today.

1314
01:59:57,141 --> 02:00:01,606
I am repeating your statement.
On the night of 13th October. . .

1315
02:00:01,746 --> 02:00:06,119
at 1 1 pm, you were passing
through Worli Naka. . .

1316
02:00:06,350 --> 02:00:10,951
and heard a girl scream. You
saw some goons kidnapping a girl. . .

1317
02:00:11,195 --> 02:00:15,363
and putting her in a police jeep. You
recognise one of them as Nagesh Rana.

1318
02:00:15,439 --> 02:00:19,642
You even try to stop them.
But they don't hear your voice.

1319
02:00:21,686 --> 02:00:25,352
But how is this possible
that you hear the girl scream. . .

1320
02:00:25,489 --> 02:00:26,685
but they don't hear your voice?

1321
02:00:28,733 --> 02:00:32,639
There was a reason for that too.
You had stated it, and it was right.

1322
02:00:33,177 --> 02:00:36,149
Do you remember?
I'll tell you.

1323
02:00:36,941 --> 02:00:40,141
There was a railway track
where this incident happened.

1324
02:00:40,264 --> 02:00:43,863
A train was passing by,
so your voice could not be heard.

1325
02:00:45,670 --> 02:00:47,138
That's right.

1326
02:00:49,193 --> 02:00:57,667
You saw this incident happen
on the back road of Chitra theater.

1327
02:00:58,202 --> 02:01:02,165
You were quite far away from Worli
Naka, to the right of the taxi stand.

1328
02:01:02,727 --> 02:01:06,690
There was a temple there.

1329
02:01:07,211 --> 02:01:10,183
Am I right?
Weren't you standing near the temple?

1330
02:01:15,259 --> 02:01:16,728
Were you standing near the temple?

1331
02:01:21,265 --> 02:01:24,237
No, I was standing near the church.

1332
02:01:26,270 --> 02:01:29,732
You are right.
You were standing near the church.

1333
02:01:30,274 --> 02:01:35,046
The vehicle in which Nagesh and his
friends put the girl. . .

1334
02:01:35,279 --> 02:01:36,247
was it a police jeep?

1335
02:01:36,400 --> 02:01:40,774
I have said so a hundred times.
It was a police jeep!

1336
02:01:40,885 --> 02:01:49,666
So your statement is at 1 1:30 pm,
you were passing. . .

1337
02:01:49,814 --> 02:01:54,278
near the temple, I'm sorry, near the
church a little away from Worli Naka.

1338
02:01:54,819 --> 02:02:00,091
You heard a girl scream. You saw some
goons taking a girl forcibly. . .

1339
02:02:00,344 --> 02:02:04,307
from near the old buildings
near the railway tracks.

1340
02:02:04,629 --> 02:02:07,829
You shouted and tried to stop them.

1341
02:02:08,352 --> 02:02:12,122
But a train was passing by,
so your shouts could not be heard.

1342
02:02:12,356 --> 02:02:15,328
The goons put the girl
in a jeep and left.

1343
02:02:16,360 --> 02:02:19,822
Am I right?
Is everything what I said right?

1344
02:02:21,365 --> 02:02:26,137
The girl screamed, you shouted, a
train passed by, your voice got muffled.

1345
02:02:26,370 --> 02:02:28,841
The guys put the girl
in the ambulance and left?

1346
02:02:28,973 --> 02:02:30,772
Want any change in this statement?

1347
02:02:31,335 --> 02:02:35,800
Want any change?
- NO, everything happened like that.

1348
02:02:36,340 --> 02:02:40,805
Think and tell. Was it an
ambulance in which the girl was put?

1349
02:02:42,346 --> 02:02:43,314
Yes.

1350
02:02:43,467 --> 02:02:45,334
But you just said
it was a police jeep.

1351
02:02:48,352 --> 02:02:51,814
It will be better if you repeat
the whole incident before the court.

1352
02:02:54,879 --> 02:02:57,349
I was passing through
Worli Naka at night.

1353
02:02:57,481 --> 02:03:02,857
Give details.
What was the time? Go back and think.

1354
02:03:03,167 --> 02:03:06,105
Where were you coming from?

1355
02:03:07,892 --> 02:03:10,864
I got off the last local
train at Chembur.

1356
02:03:12,416 --> 02:03:14,181
I passed the Naka to take a bus.

1357
02:03:14,418 --> 02:03:18,188
You were passing through Worli Naka.
So you must not have got off. . .

1358
02:03:18,422 --> 02:03:20,893
at Chembur station,
but at Mahalaxmi station.

1359
02:03:22,426 --> 02:03:24,396
Yes, Mahalaxmi.

1360
02:03:25,429 --> 02:03:29,301
Last train, means you got off at
about 12-12:30 at Mahalaxmi station.

1361
02:03:29,433 --> 02:03:34,239
You reached Worli Naka at 1 pm.
Which means this incident happened. . .

1362
02:03:34,398 --> 02:03:35,366
around 1 pm.

1363
02:03:37,401 --> 02:03:39,872
Yes.
- But you have been saying. . .

1364
02:03:40,004 --> 02:03:43,374
the incident occurred
between 1 1-1 1:30 pm.

1365
02:03:43,888 --> 02:03:46,358
And if you were at Mahalaxmi station
at 1 1-1 1:30. . .

1366
02:03:46,531 --> 02:03:50,402
then that train
was not the last train.

1367
02:03:52,416 --> 02:03:58,383
I remember I got off at
Chembur station at 12: 27.

1368
02:03:59,944 --> 02:04:01,914
No, I got of at Mahalaxmi.

1369
02:04:03,427 --> 02:04:07,892
The question remains, on which train
you got off at what time and where.

1370
02:04:09,473 --> 02:04:14,940
Anyway, at Worli Naka, where you
saw this whole incident happen. . .

1371
02:04:15,960 --> 02:04:19,923
was there any building behind it?
- Yes, I was standing near a temple.

1372
02:04:20,084 --> 02:04:25,459
It was not a temple, but a church.
You have made that statement.

1373
02:04:26,490 --> 02:04:28,961
You sometimes get off at Mahalaxmi,
and sometimes at Chembur.

1374
02:04:29,493 --> 02:04:31,292
At the time of incident, you are
sometimes standing near a church. . .

1375
02:04:31,455 --> 02:04:32,924
and sometimes near a temple.

1376
02:04:33,457 --> 02:04:35,017
The vehicle in which
the girl was put. . .

1377
02:04:35,219 --> 02:04:36,916
is sometimes a police jeep,
and sometimes, an ambulance.

1378
02:04:37,221 --> 02:04:40,922
You are taking so long in explaining
the incident to the court.

1379
02:04:41,065 --> 02:04:43,935
When will the court know the exact
details of the incident that you saw.

1380
02:04:45,469 --> 02:04:49,170
Changing your statement every time
makes it clear. . .

1381
02:04:49,473 --> 02:04:53,243
you are out to hide
some mistake, some lie.

1382
02:04:53,477 --> 02:04:56,939
I am not a liar! Everything
I have spoken is the truth.

1383
02:04:57,081 --> 02:05:00,349
The vehicle I saw on 13th October
in which Nagesh and his men. . .

1384
02:05:00,484 --> 02:05:01,953
kidnapped the girl was a police jeep.

1385
02:05:02,086 --> 02:05:04,352
The incident happened at 1 1:30.

1386
02:05:04,488 --> 02:05:07,950
There was a church
where this happened.

1387
02:05:08,492 --> 02:05:10,690
But last night at 1 pm at
Chembur Naka. . .

1388
02:05:10,895 --> 02:05:14,390
Nagesh picked a girl and
put her in an ambulance.

1389
02:05:14,539 --> 02:05:18,000
There was a temple from
where I saw this incident.

1390
02:05:18,302 --> 02:05:21,503
The two incidents are separate.
Do you understand that, Mr. Advocate?

1391
02:05:24,028 --> 02:05:28,401
You mean you saw this
incident happen again last night?

1392
02:05:28,553 --> 02:05:30,021
Yes!

1393
02:05:31,275 --> 02:05:34,840
Nagesh picked up a girl again
last night at Chembur Naka?

1394
02:05:34,999 --> 02:05:37,971
Yes!

1395
02:05:40,525 --> 02:05:43,986
I don't want to touch
this statement of Master.

1396
02:05:45,530 --> 02:05:51,998
Nagesh is in the crime branch
lock-up under tight security. . .

1397
02:05:52,537 --> 02:05:55,998
was seen by Master last night
at Chembur Naka.

1398
02:05:58,062 --> 02:06:03,027
My Lord, to understand Master's
mental state. . .

1399
02:06:03,548 --> 02:06:06,018
I want to come to the
report kept on your table.

1400
02:06:06,551 --> 02:06:12,518
The report clearly states that he
is suffering from mental illness.

1401
02:06:12,677 --> 02:06:15,547
What do you mean?
- Just a minute!

1402
02:06:17,081 --> 02:06:19,051
You will be given a chance to speak.
So please wait.

1403
02:06:22,086 --> 02:06:27,358
My Lord, in such cases, the mental
condition of patients becomes such. . .

1404
02:06:27,612 --> 02:06:30,516
that they begin to hallucinate.

1405
02:06:30,535 --> 02:06:36,001
For example, a crowd is
watching a street show. . .

1406
02:06:36,300 --> 02:06:37,735
but he feels
someone is being beaten.

1407
02:06:38,543 --> 02:06:41,515
If they see someone running
to catch a train or bus. . .

1408
02:06:41,746 --> 02:06:43,545
they feel someone
is trying to kill him.

1409
02:06:44,068 --> 02:06:48,031
Such a man can imagine a rope
to be a snake and scream.

1410
02:06:48,593 --> 02:06:51,565
He can imagine
a pen to be a revolver.

1411
02:06:51,756 --> 02:06:53,555
And think the telephone ring
to be lightening. . .

1412
02:06:53,678 --> 02:06:55,773
and shut all the
doors and windows of the house.

1413
02:06:56,080 --> 02:07:01,045
For him, the identity
of everything changes.

1414
02:07:01,606 --> 02:07:05,569
Such a man fears everything.

1415
02:07:06,611 --> 02:07:14,081
Rope, snake, telephone, lightening,
everything is different.

1416
02:07:14,619 --> 02:07:17,089
Master, tell me
what is in your pocket?

1417
02:07:20,625 --> 02:07:23,095
I have understood your game.

1418
02:07:25,149 --> 02:07:28,121
I have understood that
you want to prove in court. . .

1419
02:07:29,674 --> 02:07:34,582
that Sachdanand Chaudhary,
who is standing here is a mad man.

1420
02:07:34,599 --> 02:07:37,069
But I want to tell
you that I am not mad.

1421
02:07:39,604 --> 02:07:43,567
I have said what I saw,
and I never lied in my life.

1422
02:07:45,409 --> 02:07:48,108
Want to know what is in my pocket?

1423
02:07:48,613 --> 02:07:51,083
I can even tell you
what's in your pocket.

1424
02:07:52,056 --> 02:07:55,119
I have this pen in my pocket
with which you write.

1425
02:07:55,660 --> 02:08:01,126
I know there is a clock on that
wall and it's 4:38 right now.

1426
02:08:01,666 --> 02:08:05,127
I know that machine is a type writer.

1427
02:08:06,150 --> 02:08:11,115
I know you speak into a phone
and write with a pen.

1428
02:08:11,676 --> 02:08:16,140
I know that woman there is
my wife, and her name is Gayatri.

1429
02:08:16,681 --> 02:08:19,379
The man sitting with her is my
son's to-be father-in-law.

1430
02:08:19,684 --> 02:08:24,148
I know my innocent son
is rotting in jail. . .

1431
02:08:24,288 --> 02:08:26,155
is not being released.

1432
02:08:27,211 --> 02:08:32,621
I know this is my specs cover,
and you want to prove me mad?

1433
02:08:32,737 --> 02:08:37,110
I am not mad. I know this
is not a pen, but a revolver.

1434
02:08:37,942 --> 02:08:41,142
And a man can die with it.
Want to know how?

1435
02:08:42,066 --> 02:08:44,127
Want to know how?
Like this!

1436
02:08:55,199 --> 02:08:56,167
'Truth always triumphs'

1437
02:10:11,275 --> 02:10:13,746
Your father was crazy.

1438
02:10:15,279 --> 02:10:22,249
He created such circumstances
for me. . .

1439
02:10:22,807 --> 02:10:27,271
that I had to beat up my own son.

1440
02:10:28,813 --> 02:10:34,222
Your father is dead,
but his punishment is not over.

1441
02:10:35,780 --> 02:10:39,743
It is said that until a son doesn't
perform the final rites of his father

1442
02:10:39,864 --> 02:10:41,731
his soul doesn't get salvation.

1443
02:10:43,788 --> 02:10:46,555
And I have made such arrangements. . .

1444
02:10:46,791 --> 02:10:50,252
that you won't be able
to perform Master's final rites.

1445
02:10:50,795 --> 02:10:51,763
As per court orders. . .

1446
02:11:05,329 --> 02:11:09,292
The son of a petty school
master has hot blood?

1447
02:11:09,814 --> 02:11:11,784
I never expected this.

1448
02:11:13,337 --> 02:11:19,304
Kamble, cool him.

1449
02:11:58,422 --> 02:12:02,887
Why are they taking him?

1450
02:12:03,427 --> 02:12:05,898
Why has my son not come?

1451
02:12:06,430 --> 02:12:07,899
Let my son come.

1452
02:12:09,954 --> 02:12:11,719
What are you saying, Mr. Kamble?

1453
02:12:11,956 --> 02:12:15,156
A son cannot perform
his father's last rites?

1454
02:12:18,963 --> 02:12:24,429
Stop! I said the final rites won't
be performed until my son comes.

1455
02:12:24,969 --> 02:12:27,439
Mr. Kamble, Vishal is the
only son of Master.

1456
02:12:27,972 --> 02:12:31,274
Doesn't your court
know that a father's. . .

1457
02:12:31,415 --> 02:12:35,880
Look Mr. Giri, the court orders
are in Vishal's interest.

1458
02:12:36,420 --> 02:12:41,385
Police has information that
some goons want to kill him.

1459
02:12:41,546 --> 02:12:44,142
There could be riots in the city
if he is released.

1460
02:12:44,949 --> 02:12:51,725
We have orders to perform Master's
last rites before 7. . .

1461
02:12:51,956 --> 02:12:52,924
under police security.

1462
02:12:53,958 --> 02:12:58,160
I don't like all this, but I
am helpless. I have to do my duty.

1463
02:12:58,482 --> 02:13:04,449
Right! Absolutely right.
You do your duty.

1464
02:13:05,009 --> 02:13:08,470
Cremate him.
Cremate him as per court orders.

1465
02:13:09,013 --> 02:13:14,479
He deserves this! His son should
not perform his final rites.

1466
02:13:14,779 --> 02:13:18,479
The man who was honest
should be punished.

1467
02:13:19,023 --> 02:13:24,489
Take, cremate him.
He deserves this!

1468
02:13:26,030 --> 02:13:26,998
But Kamble!

1469
02:13:30,034 --> 02:13:33,438
It is not only
Master who will turn to ash.

1470
02:13:34,478 --> 02:13:38,749
But the fire of anger of my son
will turn everyone. . .

1471
02:13:39,003 --> 02:13:40,973
from Jaspal Rana to you,
to ash!

1472
02:13:41,485 --> 02:13:42,954
Ash!

1473
02:13:46,531 --> 02:13:49,992
All the wounds were on his head.
We have cleaned them.

1474
02:13:50,535 --> 02:13:53,005
I have prescribed some medicines.
Get these for him.

1475
02:15:54,619 --> 02:16:00,085
Don't you dare remove that letter!
- I was only removing my handkerchief.

1476
02:16:01,145 --> 02:16:04,607
See what trick my elder brother
has played this time.

1477
02:16:05,149 --> 02:16:09,614
My niece cannot get married
until I sell that land.

1478
02:16:10,154 --> 02:16:16,121
I cannot sell the land and
hurt my late grandfather's soul.

1479
02:16:16,280 --> 02:16:20,152
It is ancestral land.
- What land?

1480
02:16:20,284 --> 02:16:22,151
That same two and a half
acres of land.

1481
02:16:22,687 --> 02:16:25,157
My brother has sent a letter again.
Shall I show. . .

1482
02:16:25,289 --> 02:16:26,257
No!

1483
02:16:33,137 --> 02:16:36,109
Is it. . . is it!

1484
02:16:37,141 --> 02:16:39,612
Mr. Rana,
Vishal has escaped from jail!

1485
02:16:42,667 --> 02:16:43,635
Is it?

1486
02:16:47,191 --> 02:16:52,658
Mr. Kamble, you must be very
happy to give me this news.

1487
02:16:53,197 --> 02:16:55,668
So criminals have
begun to escape from jail?

1488
02:16:58,202 --> 02:17:01,174
How many times had I told you
to keep strict vigil on Vishal.

1489
02:17:08,212 --> 02:17:09,180
Where is Nagesh?

1490
02:18:02,266 --> 02:18:05,238
''They are after me''

1491
02:18:17,281 --> 02:18:20,253
''Some boys are standing before me,
and some behind me''

1492
02:18:20,805 --> 02:18:23,777
''Some are standing on the terrace,
and some below''

1493
02:18:24,288 --> 02:18:27,750
''They are after me''

1494
02:19:10,334 --> 02:19:13,535
''Look how many crazy men are here''

1495
02:19:14,338 --> 02:19:17,310
''So many guys for one girl''

1496
02:19:17,822 --> 02:19:20,794
''How do I hide my beauty?''

1497
02:19:21,345 --> 02:19:24,807
''How do I save myself?''

1498
02:19:26,871 --> 02:19:29,843
''How do I explain to them,
they are crazy''

1499
02:19:30,354 --> 02:19:33,258
''Some are standing on the terrace,
and some below''

1500
02:19:34,318 --> 02:19:37,290
''They are after me''

1501
02:20:18,402 --> 02:20:21,773
''I am only 1 7 yet''

1502
02:20:21,886 --> 02:20:25,154
''My naive youth is in danger here''

1503
02:20:25,409 --> 02:20:28,871
''Some attack with me with their eyes''

1504
02:20:29,413 --> 02:20:32,317
''Some love me secretly''

1505
02:20:34,378 --> 02:20:37,840
''How do I escape,
the are so many here''

1506
02:20:38,382 --> 02:20:41,354
''Some are standing on the terrace,
and some below''

1507
02:20:41,626 --> 02:20:43,823
''They are after me. . .''

1508
02:23:10,736 --> 02:23:14,197
Shoot at sight orders have
been given for Vishal, Mr. Rana

1509
02:23:14,740 --> 02:23:20,206
Within 24 hours, Vishal's body
will be before you.

1510
02:23:32,758 --> 02:23:35,730
I have killed your Nagesh.

1511
02:23:36,762 --> 02:23:37,730
What! !

1512
02:23:38,804 --> 02:23:42,265
I could not perform my father's
final rites because of you.

1513
02:23:43,809 --> 02:23:47,009
But you will see
your son being cremated.

1514
02:23:47,292 --> 02:23:48,761
What nonsense are you talking!

1515
02:23:48,894 --> 02:23:52,162
I didn't want to defile
the crematorium. . .

1516
02:23:52,297 --> 02:23:54,267
by cremating Nagesh's
body in there.

1517
02:23:55,821 --> 02:24:00,786
I have cremated him
near a gutter in Kapaswadi.

1518
02:24:02,347 --> 02:24:06,812
Rana, if you reach in time,
you'll see the fire.

1519
02:24:07,833 --> 02:24:10,737
If you delay, you'll get ash.

1520
02:24:18,804 --> 02:24:21,776
What happened, Mr. Rana?
What fire is this?

1521
02:24:23,809 --> 02:24:27,270
This is not a fire,
it is Nagesh.

1522
02:24:45,350 --> 02:24:49,815
I'd told him the first day itself
not to feel shy, just do it.

1523
02:24:50,355 --> 02:24:53,327
He even takes a joke seriously.
- That's how he is.

1524
02:24:54,359 --> 02:24:57,331
He's like that. If he had
four legs, ask him the answer.

1525
02:24:59,364 --> 02:25:01,835
You are right, even four. . .

1526
02:25:19,865 --> 02:25:21,333
How are you Mr. Pradhan?

1527
02:25:23,869 --> 02:25:26,339
Won't you
introduce me to your family?

1528
02:25:26,872 --> 02:25:28,842
Yes, sure.

1529
02:25:30,876 --> 02:25:35,841
He is my elder son, Vinod.
He is a doctor in America.

1530
02:25:38,884 --> 02:25:45,352
She is my elder daughter-in-law.
He is my younger son.

1531
02:25:46,411 --> 02:25:47,880
He's planning to put
up a factory in Patna.

1532
02:25:50,896 --> 02:25:52,866
She's my wife.

1533
02:25:58,944 --> 02:26:04,911
He. . . he's my son grandson, Rinku.

1534
02:26:12,878 --> 02:26:15,348
Rinku, my name is Vishal.

1535
02:26:16,681 --> 02:26:22,854
I am your grandfather's client.
He has put me in a dilemma.

1536
02:26:23,929 --> 02:26:26,399
I don't know its outcome.

1537
02:26:27,933 --> 02:26:29,903
Do you know how
your grandfather is?

1538
02:26:31,937 --> 02:26:33,405
I'll tell you.

1539
02:26:35,420 --> 02:26:37,891
He has made a name for himself
in the world ofjustice.

1540
02:26:38,944 --> 02:26:43,408
He wins every case.

1541
02:26:44,469 --> 02:26:47,441
He exposes truth and lies in minutes.

1542
02:26:48,954 --> 02:26:54,921
No judge gives verdict
against his arguments.

1543
02:26:55,961 --> 02:26:59,924
He is such a good man, he
doesn't like being praised.

1544
02:27:02,007 --> 02:27:03,977
Go to your room.

1545
02:27:10,255 --> 02:27:13,888
Why Mr. Pradhan, sweating
after hearing your own praises?

1546
02:27:15,941 --> 02:27:18,913
Shut-up!
No one will scream!

1547
02:27:20,465 --> 02:27:23,927
I heard my mom lost her
voice when my father died.

1548
02:27:24,950 --> 02:27:27,420
A teacher had
reformed you in childhood.

1549
02:27:27,993 --> 02:27:30,965
It was because of him
your course of life changed.

1550
02:27:31,076 --> 02:27:33,444
And mine changed
because of a lawyer.

1551
02:27:37,482 --> 02:27:38,450
Forgive me.

1552
02:27:39,484 --> 02:27:41,454
He has cut the phone line.

1553
02:27:41,606 --> 02:27:43,473
And also closed
the doors from outside.

1554
02:27:45,010 --> 02:27:47,480
Forgive me.
- No, Mr. Pradhan.

1555
02:27:49,014 --> 02:27:52,977
A man who raises his finger in court
and speaks with confidence. . .

1556
02:27:54,019 --> 02:27:56,489
how can he fold
his hands and apologise?

1557
02:27:57,542 --> 02:27:59,011
It doesn't seem right.

1558
02:28:07,072 --> 02:28:11,980
Don't beat me.
I will say in court. . .

1559
02:28:13,999 --> 02:28:16,469
You will never be
able to see court now.

1560
02:28:20,005 --> 02:28:27,977
You look human,
but you are something else.

1561
02:28:29,014 --> 02:28:31,484
You are different from this world.

1562
02:28:32,017 --> 02:28:33,485
And I am different.

1563
02:28:34,539 --> 02:28:36,008
Want to see?

1564
02:28:46,071 --> 02:28:48,541
Look, my blood is red.

1565
02:28:50,075 --> 02:28:52,545
Your blood cannot be red.

1566
02:29:17,062 --> 02:29:20,523
Famous lawyer Ashok Pradhan,
a gold medalist. . .

1567
02:29:20,826 --> 02:29:22,021
is no more.

1568
02:29:31,596 --> 02:29:34,067
While performing your
father's final rites. . .

1569
02:29:34,599 --> 02:29:37,571
fit this in your heart and brain. . .

1570
02:29:38,083 --> 02:29:42,547
that you are shouldering not your
father's coffin, but sin.

1571
02:29:52,137 --> 02:29:54,607
Hello Kamble, Nagesh here.
- Who?

1572
02:29:54,900 --> 02:29:57,097
Nagesh!
- Who Nagesh?

1573
02:29:57,622 --> 02:29:59,991
Nagesh! I am alive!

1574
02:30:00,145 --> 02:30:04,609
Nagesh, you are alive?
- Yes!

1575
02:30:04,750 --> 02:30:06,116
Where are you calling from?

1576
02:30:06,311 --> 02:30:09,112
From some place
near the sea in Colaba.

1577
02:30:09,674 --> 02:30:12,578
Don't worry Nagesh, I am coming.

1578
02:30:12,878 --> 02:30:17,080
Just tell me where he is.
- He is not here right now.

1579
02:30:17,202 --> 02:30:21,074
He's gone out to get food.
I am very scared.

1580
02:30:21,606 --> 02:30:24,077
Please come soon.

1581
02:30:26,131 --> 02:30:28,101
Don't worry, I'm coming.

1582
02:30:37,662 --> 02:30:40,634
Kamble!
- Upstairs!

1583
02:30:56,201 --> 02:31:01,667
Kamesh, hurry!
Open his ropes.

1584
02:34:53,478 --> 02:34:56,940
Mr. Rana, Patil here. Vishal is
here drinking tea in National hotel.

1585
02:35:24,950 --> 02:35:28,913
Stop! I saw Nagesh in the taxi.
Stop the car!

1586
02:35:30,475 --> 02:35:31,944
I cannot stop,
there are cars behind.

1587
02:35:32,077 --> 02:35:34,947
Stop the car!

1588
02:35:38,483 --> 02:35:40,954
Why did you stop here?
Move!

1589
02:35:45,010 --> 02:35:46,980
Stop that taxi!

1590
02:35:48,493 --> 02:35:50,463
Nagesh, my son!

1591
02:36:04,549 --> 02:36:06,018
Stop the taxi!

1592
02:37:02,607 --> 02:37:05,078
Remember what you
had told me in jail?

1593
02:37:06,091 --> 02:37:09,291
Vishal Agnihotri, I have
made such arrangements. . .

1594
02:37:09,614 --> 02:37:12,017
that you will not be able to perform
the final rites of your father.

1595
02:37:13,058 --> 02:37:14,026
Remember?

1596
02:37:15,540 --> 02:37:17,237
What do you think of my arrangement?

1597
02:37:43,608 --> 02:37:46,580
I don't want to die with you!
Help!

1598
02:37:48,613 --> 02:37:53,078
If I want to save myself,
I must get out. Mr. Rana is finished!

1599
02:37:56,621 --> 02:37:58,090
Take, kill him!

1600
02:39:16,141 --> 02:39:17,109
Yes, I'm coming.

1601
02:41:14,259 --> 02:41:15,227
Move!

1602
02:41:43,809 --> 02:41:44,777
Darling, we are late.

1603
02:45:22,067 --> 02:45:27,533
Mr. Vishal, after knowing your
side of the story. . .

1604
02:45:27,833 --> 02:45:30,531
the Committee has reached
a verdict. . .

1605
02:45:31,076 --> 02:45:36,041
that your life sentence
should be reduced to four years.

1606
02:45:36,601 --> 02:45:38,070
Don't reduce my sentence.

1607
02:45:39,084 --> 02:45:40,052
Don't!

1608
02:45:40,605 --> 02:45:45,070
You won't do anything great
in reducing my sentence.

1609
02:45:45,210 --> 02:45:47,977
If you want to do something,
create such circumstances. . .

1610
02:45:48,093 --> 02:45:51,554
that another Vishal doesn't
sit here and embarrass you again.

1611
02:45:55,140 --> 02:45:56,608
Reduce my sentence indeed!

1612
02:46:02,627 --> 02:46:03,595
Reduce my sentence indeed!

1613
02:46:03,762 --> 02:47:05,021
