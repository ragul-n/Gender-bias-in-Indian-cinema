1
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:29,839
Son, from India you are going
to an Arab country for a job.

2
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:33,707
It is a new country. Look after
yourself and daughter-in-law.

3
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,140
Mother, you do not worry.

4
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:37,213
I will not only look after her
and me,...

5
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:40,180
...but also send you bundles of
money every month.

6
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:42,512
I am worried about you,...

7
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:44,752
...and you are just talking
about money.

8
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:48,324
Son, work hard and be honest
in your work over there.

9
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,722
And always keep up the name
of your nation.

10
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:53,889
Alright mother.
I will just do as you say.

11
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:55,664
There will be just
no difference.

12
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:58,668
- And promise me one thing.
- What?

13
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:02,239
Your first child will be
born in lndia.

14
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:06,240
I promise you that we both
will come back to lndia...

15
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:08,344
...before the child is born.

16
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:10,846
- Are you happy now? - Very
happy. God bless you, son.

17
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:39,672
- Greetings!
- Hello!

18
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,413
Hello!

19
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:55,691
Yashoda!

20
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:02,598
Yashoda, God has answered your
prayers. I have been promoted.

21
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:08,404
- Is this for me?
- Yes. It is for you.

22
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:11,707
It is very beautiful.

23
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:15,980
Tomorrow itself, we will go to
our country lndia.

24
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:19,809
Mother-in-law had a strong
desire that...

25
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:22,988
...our first child should be
born in lndia itself.

26
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:25,721
So, this desire of hers will
be fulfilled.

27
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:28,292
But what about my wish?

28
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:32,257
If God wishes, we will have
a girl child.

29
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:34,296
- But...
- But what?

30
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:37,264
I want a boy.

31
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:46,378
Run! Monster Khaleel
has arrived.

32
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,395
Come on, let us go inside.
Quick! Khaleel is here.

33
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:57,438
Help!

34
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:28,142
You all know that...

35
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:31,118
...Khaleel has started attacking
our border again.

36
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:37,818
Here...here! He has destroyed
the whole area of Al-Gobar.

37
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:40,091
He killed men and women.

38
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:42,324
As usual, he took children away
with him.

39
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:47,372
I am feeling so ashamed about
this whole incident that...

40
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,566
And I am sure, that even you all
must be realising...

41
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:53,836
...that till today, we have not
been able to do anything.

42
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:56,178
We could not even arrest
the wretched monster.

43
00:11:56,315 --> 00:12:00,445
We all know that Khaleel is a
cruel, wicked,...

44
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:03,177
...fraudulent and dangerous
assassin.

45
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:06,189
And Sir, one of his companions
is a magician too.

46
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:08,393
Khaleel attacks in the places
suggested by him.

47
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:12,291
He comes likes a storm, spreads
destruction and disappears.

48
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:15,193
And Sir, he takes children
out of the border,...

49
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:16,867
...and sells them at an
exorbitant price.

50
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:18,633
I have thought of a solution
for this too.

51
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:22,630
For crushing this demon, I have
asked help from such a man...

52
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:25,276
...who is very well-aquainted
with every part of this desert.

53
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:27,341
He has great patriotic feelings.

54
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:29,571
And he considers his duty to
serve the nation.

55
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,775
He can shed his blood for wiping
tears of the poor and helpless.

56
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:36,354
The person is
Sheikh Mohammed Al-Kamal.

57
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:58,608
- Father, save me.
- My child!

58
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:03,846
Leave my daughter.

59
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:06,511
- Help!
- Leave my child.

60
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:08,787
Leave my child.

61
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:10,688
Leave me.

62
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,390
Leave my father.

63
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,354
Father!

64
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:19,192
Oh Great Lord, please show us
your miracle.

65
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:21,663
- No. Leave my father alone.
- Have mercy on this old man.

66
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:42,178
Who are you?

67
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:50,625
Help of the helpless!

68
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:51,894
Friend of the poor!

69
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:53,422
An enemy of the bad men!

70
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:54,497
And death of torturers!

71
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:57,828
- Father!
- My child!

72
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:06,904
My child!

73
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:09,841
Sir, your honor is safe.

74
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,710
No one can ruin it.

75
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:14,946
- Good bye.
- Thank God.

76
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:18,747
My child, who was this angel?

77
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,924
He was not an angel, father.

78
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:24,851
He is Sheikh Mohammed Al-Kamaal.

79
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:40,210
Excellent! What an aim! As if
the bullet obeys your command.

80
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:41,779
It reaches wherever you ask
it to go.

81
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:44,472
A man controls his destiny with
hard work and practice.

82
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:46,344
I have just shot bullets.

83
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:49,749
Sheikh, even we shoot bullets,
but where do we get such an aim!

84
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:52,957
Sheikh's stars are shining so
brightly these days...

85
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:07,564
No no.

86
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:14,742
Mohammed, before your arrival,
I always decide that...

87
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:18,814
...I will tell you many things,
open the book of my heart...

88
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:21,509
But as soon as you come
before me...

89
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,982
...I forget everything.

90
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:24,987
I just keep looking at you.

91
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:30,686
Mohammed, every moment of
separation seems like ages.

92
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:35,525
Break the wall of separation.
Take me away from here.

93
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:38,803
You may make me your servant and
keep me near your feet.

94
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,739
In your love, I just
forget the world.

95
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:53,543
Somehow, you too happen
to remember me!

96
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:56,150
Oh God!

97
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,884
What is written?
Tell us too.

98
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:05,486
I will not tell you.
All of you go away from here.

99
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:08,667
Alright. Keep sitting here.

100
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:11,902
Where are you going?

101
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,274
It is something special.
Can you see anything?

102
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,705
Zahira, it would have been
so nice if...

103
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:22,981
...God would have given many
hearts to one person.

104
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:25,350
Because, every single moment
of youth...

105
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:28,314
...seems longer than a lifetime.

106
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:31,286
And this cannot be tolerated
by just one heart.

107
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:34,321
I know it.
And my heart knows it.

108
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:38,259
And God knows, how I have
spent these moments,...

109
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,465
...without you.

110
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:46,802
And now I am only waiting for
the moment...

111
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:48,940
...when you become a bride,
hide your moon like beautiful...

112
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:52,333
...face behind a veil and come
to my house.

113
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:54,946
I will feel proud of my
destiny...

114
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,144
...and will thank the one who
wrote my destiny.

115
00:16:57,549 --> 00:17:00,643
- Really?
- Yes, Zahina. Really!

116
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:04,279
I can hear his voice.

117
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:06,547
Even your voice is reaching me.

118
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:09,483
Oh God! What kind of miracle
is this!

119
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:14,499
Mohammed!

120
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,806
This is not a miracle.
This is passion.

121
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:29,811
This is love.

122
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:10,949
Wow! This is called luck.

123
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:13,483
Firstly, God has made you
extremely beautiful.

124
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:15,960
Then He gave you a very
handsome husband.

125
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:19,156
We will be happy to get such a
husband atleast in our dreams.

126
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:22,161
If that is so, why didn't you
get married to Sheikh Mohammed?

127
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:24,959
Once he saw this moon-like
beauty,...

128
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,099
...why will he look at smaller
stars?

129
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:28,838
You girl,
what commotion are you creating?

130
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:30,434
I am making no commotion, aunty.

131
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,342
We are only breaking the
blisters of our heart.

132
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:34,240
You will keep breaking blisters
all your life.

133
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:36,674
Come on, the celebrations are
about to begin. Come on.

134
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:42,792
Abdulla!
Who is Abdulla?

135
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:45,726
Surprising! You have not heard
Abdulla's name, before?

136
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:49,697
- No.
- Abdulla is an Emperor.

137
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:52,768
He rules over this desert.

138
00:22:53,605 --> 00:22:56,096
You must have heard the names
of great Kings,...

139
00:22:56,308 --> 00:23:01,268
...about their palaces and
diamond studded thrones.

140
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:05,244
But this Emperor is the
most unique.

141
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:09,647
His palace is a small hut...

142
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:12,924
...which is not made of
marble pieces...

143
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:14,485
...but out of mud.

144
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,124
And his treasures are not
gold and silver coins,...

145
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:21,797
...but a well of cold water.

146
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:25,167
...which remains full,
throughout out the year.

147
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:27,939
And in a desert, the price of
one drop of water...

148
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:32,140
...sometimes becomes as much
as a gold coin.

149
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:34,468
A small hut!

150
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:36,374
7 date palms.

151
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:38,140
And a well of cold water.

152
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:41,316
All this is what
Emperor Abdulla possesses.

153
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:24,627
This will reduce the pain and
even the wound will heal soon.

154
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:34,366
Why? Your old eyes are already
shining?

155
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:37,503
The Caravan has still not come.

156
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:40,877
You are already smelling the
male camels?

157
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:43,211
Have some shame!

158
00:24:43,548 --> 00:24:46,881
You have become old. Your feet
are already in the grave.

159
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:49,420
But you are still very
romantic?

160
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:54,419
I wonder why has God
created women!

161
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:57,153
The first woman that He made...

162
00:24:57,362 --> 00:25:00,820
...was Eve, who removed
Adam from Heaven.

163
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:03,695
I wonder who all will you remove
from here.

164
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:11,568
My name is Khaleel.

165
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:14,243
From wherever I pass in the
desert...

166
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:15,846
...people's head bow.

167
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:18,642
And you are still standing with
a raised head in front of me?

168
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:29,726
Abdulla's head bows only in
front of God,...

169
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:32,792
...and not in front of any
human being.

170
00:25:32,964 --> 00:25:35,398
We want water, you old man!

171
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,761
Not for free!
I will pay you its price.

172
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:40,836
You are young. You also have
enough strength in you.

173
00:25:40,972 --> 00:25:44,203
The well is in front of you.
Quench your thirst and go away.

174
00:25:58,189 --> 00:25:59,417
Why didn't you allow me to
kill this man?

175
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:05,753
Fool! In a desert, one a drop of
water is valuable than life.

176
00:26:05,997 --> 00:26:09,398
If we kill him, who will
look after the well?

177
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:18,232
Take this, old man!
The price of water.

178
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:24,340
You are probably going on a
long journey.

179
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:28,679
Yes. Away from this desert and
the ugly people living in it.

180
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:33,250
Abdulla does not take money
from far away travelers.

181
00:26:36,294 --> 00:26:38,262
And once Khaleel
pays a price,...

182
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:39,724
...he does not take it back.

183
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:42,365
I have taken water
from the well.

184
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:43,865
So, I will pay the price
to the well itself.

185
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:46,403
See you again, old man!

186
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,684
Sheikh Mohammed is arriving.

187
00:27:14,866 --> 00:27:15,332
This is your house from today
onwards.

188
00:27:52,737 --> 00:27:54,671
She is my nanny Gangabai.

189
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:57,168
Her father and my father were
very close friends.

190
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:58,570
Both of them died in a battle.

191
00:27:58,977 --> 00:28:02,708
Today is a day of happiness. Why
are you talking about sorrow?

192
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:05,313
May God keep both of you happy.

193
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:07,711
And may our daughter-in-law
be a mother, soon.

194
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:09,510
Come.

195
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:15,690
Where are you all going?
Come with me.

196
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:51,318
I am really moved on hearing
her story.

197
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:56,765
God alone knows what is in
his mind.

198
00:33:58,736 --> 00:34:01,227
Abdulla, it is a five day
journey.

199
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,841
I am worried about her and
not about myself.

200
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:08,678
She is pregnant.

201
00:34:09,013 --> 00:34:12,505
She should be taken to the
hospital at the earliest.

202
00:34:13,618 --> 00:34:15,347
What if something happens
on the way?

203
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:18,817
This is the only fear
I am having.

204
00:34:19,023 --> 00:34:22,652
That is why I was saying,
give me your goat.

205
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,987
We may need milk on the way.

206
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,861
This poor woman has got nothing.

207
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:29,933
I will pay the price of the
goat.

208
00:34:31,836 --> 00:34:34,202
No, Aameer,
I do not want anything.

209
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:38,703
You take the goat with you.
But keep her tied.

210
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:42,673
I had given her away thrice
before this. But she comes back.

211
00:34:45,783 --> 00:34:46,477
We will leave now!

212
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:53,286
Come, my child.

213
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:09,499
Aameer, it is a night journey.

214
00:35:10,007 --> 00:35:13,170
Don't go right now.
I am not feeling good about it.

215
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:16,411
Abdulla, God is with us.

216
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:24,914
My child!

217
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:30,488
May God protect you.

218
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:36,682
You have run away again?
What will Aameer think now?

219
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:43,824
What is this?
How did you get hurt?

220
00:37:45,963 --> 00:37:47,294
There is no wound here.

221
00:37:47,531 --> 00:37:52,195
Did anything...
Lord, have mercy.

222
00:38:40,718 --> 00:38:42,345
Aameer!

223
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:54,789
I had told you not to go.

224
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,113
Baba!

225
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:52,514
Help me, Baba.

226
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:57,860
Have patience, my child.

227
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,491
Have courage!

228
00:40:10,975 --> 00:40:12,374
Have courage!

229
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:20,544
Save my child, Baba.

230
00:40:20,985 --> 00:40:23,385
Save my child.

231
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:27,815
Keep courage, my dear child.

232
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:33,692
Save my child, Baba.

233
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:38,597
Have patience, my child.

234
00:41:34,525 --> 00:41:36,390
See this, my child!

235
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:44,157
God has given you the biggest
gift of life.

236
00:41:44,935 --> 00:41:46,698
You have got a son.

237
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:54,700
Baba, take a swear upon your
Allah,...

238
00:41:54,945 --> 00:41:58,608
...that you will protect my
child.

239
00:42:02,786 --> 00:42:03,184
I am dying.

240
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:06,486
I have given this child
to you.

241
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:10,819
Take an oath!

242
00:42:10,961 --> 00:42:13,657
You must look after him.

243
00:42:15,966 --> 00:42:17,763
Take an oath, Baba!

244
00:42:17,968 --> 00:42:21,699
Yes, my dear.
I take an oath,...

245
00:42:21,972 --> 00:42:24,202
...that as long as I live...

246
00:42:24,441 --> 00:42:25,931
...I will protect your child.

247
00:43:48,525 --> 00:43:48,957
Krishna!

248
00:43:54,231 --> 00:43:56,426
Krishna?
Hindu?

249
00:43:59,203 --> 00:44:02,570
Oh Lord Allah,
what have you done?

250
00:44:10,881 --> 00:44:12,746
What should I do about this?

251
00:44:15,019 --> 00:44:16,247
Were should I take it?

252
00:44:17,554 --> 00:44:19,920
No!

253
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:04,725
God does not pity those who
do not pity others.

254
00:45:05,002 --> 00:45:08,563
Carry an innocent and
orphan child...

255
00:45:09,006 --> 00:45:10,200
...and hold it close
to your heart.

256
00:46:04,862 --> 00:46:06,762
Oh my new born oldie,...

257
00:46:08,999 --> 00:46:11,331
...you have more wrinkles
than me.

258
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:19,834
Now he will live with us.

259
00:46:20,244 --> 00:46:24,806
Love him also, as much as you
all love me.

260
00:46:27,151 --> 00:46:29,711
Why are you crying?

261
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:33,719
Why is he crying?

262
00:46:36,693 --> 00:46:39,355
Does anyone understand why
he is crying?

263
00:46:41,498 --> 00:46:43,159
Tell me!

264
00:46:46,904 --> 00:46:48,929
Why are you looking at my face?

265
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:01,775
Now just stand here.
Do not move.

266
00:47:34,818 --> 00:47:35,842
What are you searching for,
Abdulla?

267
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,788
I could tell you that only if
I could find anything like that?

268
00:47:38,956 --> 00:47:42,392
There are so many things here
and you cannot see anything?

269
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:44,550
What stupid goods have you
brought this time!

270
00:47:44,761 --> 00:47:46,524
Is there nothing for a baby?

271
00:47:46,663 --> 00:47:48,130
How big is he?

272
00:47:49,166 --> 00:47:51,566
By God's grace, he is this big.

273
00:47:51,835 --> 00:47:53,166
He is very small.

274
00:47:53,971 --> 00:47:57,338
I have a poor friend.
A son has been born to him.

275
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:58,940
I wanted something for him.

276
00:47:59,343 --> 00:48:02,870
Then what was the need to
narrate such a long story?

277
00:48:03,347 --> 00:48:05,338
You should have just said that
you want things for a child.

278
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:07,483
I have got lots of it.
See this.

279
00:48:07,985 --> 00:48:08,474
See! I have got all this.

280
00:48:11,188 --> 00:48:13,383
So many things for such a
small child?

281
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:15,218
This is very less!

282
00:48:15,759 --> 00:48:20,355
I have only shown you essential
things for children.

283
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:23,893
But where is the milk bottle?

284
00:48:24,368 --> 00:48:25,494
Milk bottle?

285
00:48:28,839 --> 00:48:29,464
Doesn't the baby's mother
get milk?

286
00:48:31,541 --> 00:48:33,702
No, she does not.
Just give the bottle.

287
00:48:33,944 --> 00:48:34,433
Alright.

288
00:48:35,946 --> 00:48:37,106
Take this.

289
00:48:41,718 --> 00:48:45,245
Is this a milk bottle?

290
00:48:45,522 --> 00:48:47,922
First, open this.

291
00:48:58,168 --> 00:48:59,135
Strange man!

292
00:49:22,192 --> 00:49:22,954
Ahmed!

293
00:49:26,196 --> 00:49:27,094
Abdulla!

294
00:49:27,731 --> 00:49:30,461
- Greetings!
- Greetings to you too!

295
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:35,764
- Oh Abdulla! - I was so eager
to hear the sound of your bugle.

296
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:38,903
And Abdulla, I was so eager
to see you.

297
00:49:39,276 --> 00:49:41,437
But a new oil company has
opened.

298
00:49:41,945 --> 00:49:43,435
I have got the work of
transporting goods.

299
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:44,909
That is why l
could not come here.

300
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:47,476
That is why I sent your things
through Aameer.

301
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:54,616
What is the matter, Abdulla
Didn't you get the things?

302
00:49:56,293 --> 00:49:58,124
I got the things.

303
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:03,155
But poor Aameer!

304
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:06,632
Those cruel people killed
an angel.

305
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:09,734
Aameer died?

306
00:50:11,908 --> 00:50:13,637
Another injustice took place
that night.

307
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:18,474
The killers badly injured
a woman.

308
00:50:18,982 --> 00:50:22,349
The woman gave birth to a child
before dying.

309
00:50:22,552 --> 00:50:24,577
- A child?
- Yes.

310
00:50:24,988 --> 00:50:26,182
Come.

311
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:30,088
The woman was Hindu.

312
00:50:30,394 --> 00:50:32,089
This is a Hindu woman's child.

313
00:50:32,396 --> 00:50:36,594
Oh God! Are you mad?

314
00:50:36,933 --> 00:50:38,594
You will keep a Hindu child
in your house?

315
00:50:41,138 --> 00:50:44,164
Why? Isn't a Hindu's child
a human being?

316
00:50:48,178 --> 00:50:52,444
If you were in my place, you too
would have done the same thing.

317
00:50:52,949 --> 00:50:54,678
He was born in my hands.

318
00:50:54,951 --> 00:50:58,250
Look! He is such a sweet child.

319
00:50:58,422 --> 00:51:00,117
He looks so pretty.

320
00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:03,288
Can't you see any miracle
in his birth?

321
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:15,597
Abdulla, your big talks do not
get into my small brain.

322
00:51:15,806 --> 00:51:16,830
What will you do with him?

323
00:51:17,974 --> 00:51:21,375
I will look after him as
my own child.

324
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:28,413
He has such a beautiful face.

325
00:51:28,718 --> 00:51:34,247
Abdulla, when you make him a
Muslim, you will be blessed.

326
00:51:34,491 --> 00:51:35,253
Ahmed!

327
00:51:37,694 --> 00:51:40,595
You promised the woman to keep
this child alive.

328
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:43,164
But you did not promise to
make him a Hindu.

329
00:51:44,134 --> 00:51:46,728
The dying woman gave her
treasure to me.

330
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:49,667
If I fiddle around with her
treasure, then...

331
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:54,468
...on doomsday she will drag me
to Lord Allah like a criminal.

332
00:51:54,678 --> 00:51:57,442
Abdulla, why don't you
understand?

333
00:51:57,581 --> 00:52:00,243
When she is a Hindu, how can she
go before Allah?

334
00:52:00,484 --> 00:52:02,111
Ahmed!

335
00:52:02,385 --> 00:52:06,446
Abdulla, you hated woman all your
life,...

336
00:52:06,556 --> 00:52:08,820
...because one woman had
cheated you.

337
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:12,122
Because of her, you left the
whole world,...

338
00:52:12,329 --> 00:52:13,261
...and settled down in this
desert.

339
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:14,861
All due to a woman!

340
00:52:15,232 --> 00:52:17,393
And today, you cannot convert
this boy into a Muslim,...

341
00:52:17,601 --> 00:52:20,195
...because you promised a woman,
that too a Hindu woman?

342
00:52:24,608 --> 00:52:28,772
Ahmed, the one who died was
not a woman.

343
00:52:28,912 --> 00:52:30,641
She was a mother.

344
00:52:32,449 --> 00:52:34,474
A woman may have any religion.

345
00:52:34,718 --> 00:52:37,653
But a mother has no religion.

346
00:52:38,455 --> 00:52:40,719
Because a mother herself is
a religion.

347
00:52:41,458 --> 00:52:43,824
There is heaven at her feet.

348
00:52:44,294 --> 00:52:46,489
There is godliness in her
bust.

349
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:59,472
Sheikh, there is message fore
you from the Headquarters.

350
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:13,520
Alright. Give my regards to
your Commander.

351
00:53:13,957 --> 00:53:17,290
And tell him that I am starting
a search for Khaleel from today.

352
00:53:21,164 --> 00:53:21,858
What is the matter, Sheikh?

353
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:25,691
Jamaal, Khaleel has again begun
attacking our area.

354
00:53:25,969 --> 00:53:28,164
You get your men
ready instantly.

355
00:53:28,438 --> 00:53:29,496
We have to leave soon.

356
00:53:29,973 --> 00:53:32,464
Nasir, lbrahim, make
preparations quickly.

357
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:37,610
Military has asked help from me.
I must go there immediately.

358
00:53:39,783 --> 00:53:41,944
- Yes, Zaina.
- But...

359
00:53:42,352 --> 00:53:43,944
Look after yourself.

360
00:53:45,989 --> 00:53:47,957
Do not worry.

361
00:53:52,862 --> 00:53:54,762
- Greetings!
- Greetings!

362
00:53:55,265 --> 00:53:57,290
- Nasir! - Sheikh!
- You go towards the desert.

363
00:53:57,567 --> 00:54:00,502
Jamaal, you look for Khaleel all
around the green areas.

364
00:54:00,704 --> 00:54:03,571
As soon as you have any news,
inform me in Albatore.

365
00:54:03,873 --> 00:54:06,706
But remember!
He is very dangerous.

366
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:08,978
- He should not be able to flee.
- Sheikh!

367
00:54:24,461 --> 00:54:27,191
Mohammed!
Greetings1

368
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:32,799
Mohammed, I am feeling
very happy to see you.

369
00:54:32,969 --> 00:54:35,301
Even I feel extremely happy to
meet you.

370
00:54:35,538 --> 00:54:39,474
Sir, if you permit us, can we
drink water from the well?

371
00:54:39,676 --> 00:54:41,473
- Ofcourse!
- Thank you.

372
00:54:50,186 --> 00:54:54,555
- Is he your grandson?
- Can't he be my son?

373
00:54:56,459 --> 00:55:00,418
The conditions in which Allah
gave me this child,...

374
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:02,723
...he is a son to me.

375
00:55:03,366 --> 00:55:05,891
Some months ago...

376
00:55:08,538 --> 00:55:11,564
- Jamaal!
- Nasir, fill up some water.

377
00:55:13,376 --> 00:55:17,244
Sir, by giving shelter to this
innocent and orphan child...

378
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,505
...you have done a great favor
to mankind.

379
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:25,182
I am in search of the villainous
monster...

380
00:55:25,388 --> 00:55:27,583
...who killed his mother and
many more innocent people.

381
00:55:27,791 --> 00:55:30,123
By God's good will I will
soon kill him.

382
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:34,788
These are the hoof marks of
those monsters.

383
00:55:34,964 --> 00:55:37,398
But their direction is towards
our camp.

384
00:55:37,767 --> 00:55:41,203
How did those rascals dare to
go near our camp?

385
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:42,630
It is helplessness!

386
00:55:43,807 --> 00:55:46,139
When the throat gets parched
with thirst in a desert,...

387
00:55:46,443 --> 00:55:48,877
...even a goat enters a
tiger's den.

388
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:52,941
I think they must have gone
near the oasis...

389
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:55,181
...near our camp to
fetch water.

390
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:55,943
Come on.

391
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:04,152
After very long, there is a
cold breeze today.

392
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:07,228
I feel like going into the
valleys with my friends.

393
00:56:07,464 --> 00:56:10,831
- Child, you are in the third
month. - Nothing will happen.

394
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,160
I will look after myself.

395
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:15,634
For God's sake, don't go. Horse
riding isn't good in this state.

396
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:18,833
But just listen to me.

397
00:56:19,008 --> 00:56:21,533
My dear, you are going to become
a mother.

398
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:24,976
Do not worry. I will come back
as I am going.

399
00:56:25,281 --> 00:56:26,771
Nothing will happen.

400
00:56:46,636 --> 00:56:48,297
Fill up your pots quickly.

401
00:56:48,538 --> 00:56:50,369
This is Sheikh's area.
He may come any moment.

402
00:57:02,519 --> 00:57:04,510
A pearl in a shell and a
woman in a desert!

403
00:57:04,788 --> 00:57:06,847
Such things are got with
great luck.

404
00:57:08,224 --> 00:57:10,158
Shut up.
Hide, everyone.

405
00:57:17,534 --> 00:57:20,230
No. I am sure it will be a boy.

406
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:54,152
Mohammed!

407
01:04:01,003 --> 01:04:02,903
- Zaina!
- Mohammed!

408
01:04:59,328 --> 01:05:01,626
My wife is lying in between
life and death.

409
01:05:03,165 --> 01:05:05,224
My child has not even taken
birth through her womb.

410
01:05:05,468 --> 01:05:10,235
And God forbid, if anything
happens to anyone of them,...

411
01:05:10,473 --> 01:05:13,636
...then I swear upon God,...

412
01:05:15,011 --> 01:05:18,640
...I shall follow Khaleel to the
last corner of the world.

413
01:05:18,948 --> 01:05:22,008
Even if he is in his grave,
I shall dig him out.

414
01:05:26,222 --> 01:05:28,190
By God's grace, your wife
is absolutely fine.

415
01:05:28,491 --> 01:05:31,324
Thank God.

416
01:05:37,133 --> 01:05:39,328
Come.

417
01:05:46,842 --> 01:05:49,936
Unfortunately,...

418
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:52,414
...your child has died.

419
01:05:59,455 --> 01:06:01,355
This is a time of
trial for you.

420
01:06:03,326 --> 01:06:05,692
And also...

421
01:06:05,828 --> 01:06:07,887
...you have to give courage to
your wife.

422
01:06:09,732 --> 01:06:11,825
That is very important for
her health.

423
01:06:12,034 --> 01:06:15,663
And the biggest sorrow
is that...

424
01:06:15,938 --> 01:06:19,032
...she can never become a
mother again.

425
01:06:56,312 --> 01:06:57,939
- He finished everything.
- I know it.

426
01:07:02,918 --> 01:07:06,012
Their name will remain alive.

427
01:07:06,455 --> 01:07:09,652
By God's grace, it will always
remain alive.

428
01:07:09,925 --> 01:07:14,157
I will write their name myself
in history.

429
01:07:14,463 --> 01:07:16,431
And it will not be written
in ink...

430
01:07:16,832 --> 01:07:18,663
...but in Khaleel's blood.

431
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:21,996
We went to his area and
did all this.

432
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:26,270
He will search us everywhere
to take revenge from us.

433
01:07:26,675 --> 01:07:29,166
We must get out of here
at the earliest.

434
01:07:29,478 --> 01:07:31,309
There are only two ways to
get out of here.

435
01:07:31,614 --> 01:07:33,104
One is a shorter way.

436
01:07:33,416 --> 01:07:35,350
And the other one is quite
long.

437
01:07:35,785 --> 01:07:38,720
We will go by the
Al-Hazar bridge.

438
01:07:38,988 --> 01:07:40,046
But Khaleel, that is a very
long way.

439
01:07:40,423 --> 01:07:44,052
You fool, Mohammed must have
thought we will take short cut.

440
01:07:44,293 --> 01:07:46,227
He will search for us on
the same route.

441
01:07:46,429 --> 01:07:50,388
And we will safely cross by the
Al-Hazar route.

442
01:08:13,355 --> 01:08:15,789
Sheikh, by which route must
Khaleel have gone?

443
01:08:16,025 --> 01:08:17,617
Al-Hazar or this one?

444
01:08:17,827 --> 01:08:21,228
I think he must have taken this
route as it is a short cut.

445
01:08:21,363 --> 01:08:25,231
No. Khaleel is very wicked
and smart.

446
01:08:26,469 --> 01:08:28,334
He will not go by the
Al-thani route.

447
01:08:28,471 --> 01:08:29,995
He will go by the
Al-Hazar route.

448
01:08:30,406 --> 01:08:32,601
We will catch him before he
crosses the bridge.

449
01:09:03,639 --> 01:09:06,301
Boss, Mohammed and his men
are following us.

450
01:09:06,442 --> 01:09:09,240
They are following their
death and not Khaleel.

451
01:09:09,445 --> 01:09:12,039
All of you hide in these
mountains.

452
01:09:12,448 --> 01:09:14,609
As soon as Mohammed and
his companions come...

453
01:09:14,917 --> 01:09:16,407
...shower bullets on them.

454
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:18,081
And you three, come with me.

455
01:09:18,454 --> 01:09:19,148
Alright.

456
01:09:31,233 --> 01:09:35,192
Now we will watch the death of
our enemies from here.

457
01:09:35,404 --> 01:09:37,702
Khaleel, what if they
come upto here?

458
01:09:37,973 --> 01:09:40,066
Then we will break the bridge
and kill Mohammed.

459
01:09:40,242 --> 01:09:42,608
- But our companions are on that
side. - Let them die.

460
01:09:42,878 --> 01:09:46,370
Those who cannot protect the
life of their head,...

461
01:09:46,882 --> 01:09:48,645
...deserve to die.

462
01:09:48,884 --> 01:09:50,317
- Did you understand.
- I understood.

463
01:10:41,637 --> 01:10:42,797
- Mohammed cannot be seen
anywhere. - Shut up.

464
01:11:14,069 --> 01:11:16,799
I am having food in my hand.
And this fellow is missing.

465
01:11:20,976 --> 01:11:23,171
Naughty boy!
You are troubling me?

466
01:11:26,448 --> 01:11:30,077
Wait! Where are you going?
I will bash you up.

467
01:11:33,222 --> 01:11:34,985
Dare you touch the child!

468
01:11:39,762 --> 01:11:41,923
Are you saying this?

469
01:11:42,398 --> 01:11:43,592
What made you change so much?

470
01:11:43,866 --> 01:11:46,357
Earlier, you used to hate him.

471
01:11:46,769 --> 01:11:49,602
And now, you are loving him
and also siding with him?

472
01:11:49,872 --> 01:11:53,603
But you do not know one thing.
You go and play.

473
01:11:53,876 --> 01:11:57,778
- Where are you going?
- Abdulla, where are you going?

474
01:11:58,013 --> 01:12:00,914
Just sit here.

475
01:12:03,018 --> 01:12:05,248
Abdulla, you live in the middle
of a desert.

476
01:12:06,422 --> 01:12:10,586
I roam everywhere and inquire.
This child is not a Hindu.

477
01:12:10,893 --> 01:12:13,361
- What rubbish are you talking?
- I am telling the truth.

478
01:12:13,796 --> 01:12:16,697
Abdulla, just as we have a
ceremony after birth,...

479
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:17,863
...and just as children are
taught holy prayers...

480
01:12:18,033 --> 01:12:19,967
...there is some tradition for
Hindu children too.

481
01:12:20,436 --> 01:12:22,097
I have got it written.
Just see this.

482
01:12:22,438 --> 01:12:26,807
See what is written.
Thread...ceremony...

483
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:29,603
...Balding....ceremony!

484
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:36,579
This is done by a Hindu priest.
And unless it is done...

485
01:12:36,752 --> 01:12:38,549
...the child cannot become
a Hindu.

486
01:12:38,854 --> 01:12:43,689
If this is true, I have not
done my duty yet.

487
01:12:45,227 --> 01:12:48,788
Ahmed, my friend!

488
01:12:48,964 --> 01:12:50,693
Do me a favour.

489
01:12:50,966 --> 01:12:53,059
Go and bring a Hindu priest.

490
01:12:53,235 --> 01:12:56,636
I wish to see this ceremony
before my eyes.

491
01:12:56,972 --> 01:12:59,873
I will surely go if you are
asking me to.

492
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:04,376
But see that. It is such a
lovely face.

493
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:07,715
- Make him a Muslim...
- Ahmed!

494
01:13:07,983 --> 01:13:11,817
Don't look at me angrily.
First feed me. Then I will go.

495
01:13:12,988 --> 01:13:15,320
I will bring him.

496
01:13:38,814 --> 01:13:40,839
- Did she get hurt?
- No.

497
01:13:41,049 --> 01:13:42,607
Thank God.

498
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:46,947
Naughty boy, you pushed
the girl?

499
01:13:54,096 --> 01:13:58,226
Baba, who was the woman who
took away the girl?

500
01:14:00,135 --> 01:14:01,830
That was her mother.

501
01:14:02,171 --> 01:14:05,072
Don't boys have a mother?

502
01:14:09,178 --> 01:14:10,907
Ofcourse they do, son.

503
01:14:11,113 --> 01:14:12,774
Everybody has a mother.

504
01:14:13,048 --> 01:14:14,709
Where is my mother?

505
01:14:16,051 --> 01:14:19,919
Your mother?
She died.

506
01:14:20,122 --> 01:14:23,785
That girl's mother was loving
her so much.

507
01:14:24,026 --> 01:14:26,119
Did my mother also
love me that much?

508
01:14:29,097 --> 01:14:30,928
Yes, my son. She loved you
very much.

509
01:14:31,433 --> 01:14:34,231
Baba, when a mother dies,
where does she go?

510
01:14:36,972 --> 01:14:39,270
- To heaven.
- Where is heaven?

511
01:14:39,441 --> 01:14:41,739
- Huh?
- Where is heaven?

512
01:14:42,444 --> 01:14:47,211
Heaven?

513
01:14:52,654 --> 01:14:54,349
Come with me.

514
01:15:08,237 --> 01:15:10,432
Look there.
That is heaven.

515
01:20:26,688 --> 01:20:28,713
This is where your mother
had died.

516
01:20:29,024 --> 01:20:31,959
I had made this to keep
her memory alive.

517
01:20:32,394 --> 01:20:35,227
Son, remember this place.

518
01:20:35,397 --> 01:20:37,695
If my mother die over here,...

519
01:20:37,966 --> 01:20:39,934
...how did she go to heaven?

520
01:20:40,101 --> 01:20:44,162
Everyone has to go there after
death, son.

521
01:20:44,773 --> 01:20:47,708
Just as a leaf dries and falls
off a tree,...

522
01:20:47,843 --> 01:20:50,311
...and a new leaf comes in its
place,...

523
01:20:50,779 --> 01:20:53,942
...similarly when a person's
time is over...

524
01:20:54,216 --> 01:20:57,811
...he leaves his life and
goes into his coffin.

525
01:21:13,802 --> 01:21:15,702
Greetings Maulavi
(Muslim priest)!

526
01:21:16,004 --> 01:21:19,098
I am a Muslim.
Can I come inside?

527
01:21:20,709 --> 01:21:24,941
You have already come inside.
But I am not a Maulavi.

528
01:21:25,213 --> 01:21:27,408
I am a 'Pundit'.
What work do you have?

529
01:21:31,319 --> 01:21:33,287
Why are you crying?

530
01:21:36,925 --> 01:21:39,985
If you have to cry, go and
cry in a Mosque.

531
01:21:40,395 --> 01:21:42,590
- Why are you crying here?
- Maulvi Sir!

532
01:21:42,764 --> 01:21:45,232
- I am a Pundit.
- Yes, Pundit.

533
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:49,564
I have a friend who is
a Hindu.

534
01:21:49,871 --> 01:21:51,702
He is my best friend.

535
01:21:51,973 --> 01:21:56,740
He got a son after so many
visits to various temples.

536
01:21:56,978 --> 01:22:00,379
But look at his destiny. On one
side, his son was born,...

537
01:22:00,782 --> 01:22:02,079
...while on the other hand,
the mother died.

538
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:08,211
Now doctors say that the child
will not survive.

539
01:22:08,423 --> 01:22:10,357
And my friend is very religious.

540
01:22:10,792 --> 01:22:12,851
He believes a lot in God!

541
01:22:13,061 --> 01:22:17,259
It is his desire that before
the child dies...

542
01:22:22,070 --> 01:22:22,593
...the thread...

543
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:27,273
Thread ceremony?

544
01:22:27,442 --> 01:22:31,173
Yes. That should be done.
It will be good if you come.

545
01:22:31,379 --> 01:22:32,903
I will surely come.

546
01:22:33,381 --> 01:22:35,872
I am a servant of the devotees
of God.

547
01:22:36,017 --> 01:22:38,042
How far is that village
from here?

548
01:22:38,219 --> 01:22:41,586
Not much. It is a day's journey.
One has to go on a camel.

549
01:22:43,058 --> 01:22:48,052
- On a camel? - You will feel
that you are lying on your bed.

550
01:22:48,930 --> 01:22:50,227
Where shall we leave?

551
01:22:50,398 --> 01:22:53,629
- We can leave in the morning if
you agree. - Sure.

552
01:22:53,868 --> 01:22:55,563
Thank you very much.

553
01:22:57,939 --> 01:23:00,601
God, I lied for a good cause.

554
01:23:00,875 --> 01:23:01,967
Please forgive me.

555
01:23:16,958 --> 01:23:19,586
Ahmed!

556
01:23:22,130 --> 01:23:24,963
Stop blowing the bugle.
Ahmed!

557
01:23:27,635 --> 01:23:29,193
God save me.
Why are you screaming?

558
01:23:29,437 --> 01:23:32,235
You had said that it is a
one day journey.

559
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:35,932
Now 10 days have passed.
Why did you lie?

560
01:23:36,444 --> 01:23:38,674
I did not lie to you.

561
01:23:39,014 --> 01:23:41,812
I told you one day and a zero.

562
01:23:42,017 --> 01:23:44,781
That makes it 10 days.

563
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:47,113
We will reach in another
10-15 years.

564
01:23:47,455 --> 01:23:49,855
We will reach in some time.

565
01:24:19,421 --> 01:24:19,785
Take away all this.

566
01:24:20,055 --> 01:24:23,388
You are a sinner. I will not eat
anything out of your hands.

567
01:24:23,858 --> 01:24:25,689
You said it will be a
one day journey.

568
01:24:25,860 --> 01:24:27,020
It is 10 days now.

569
01:24:27,495 --> 01:24:29,122
Where do you wish to take me?

570
01:24:29,497 --> 01:24:30,862
Where is the sick boy?

571
01:24:31,433 --> 01:24:34,402
I have never seen a good
Muslim man lie.

572
01:24:36,004 --> 01:24:37,266
- Maulavi Sir...
- Call me Pundit!

573
01:24:37,439 --> 01:24:40,772
Panditji, I lied to you.

574
01:24:41,009 --> 01:24:44,945
I became guilty in the eyes
of God and in your eyes.

575
01:24:45,447 --> 01:24:49,349
But God will forgive me because
I lied for a good cause.

576
01:24:49,717 --> 01:24:50,911
You too forgive me.

577
01:24:51,152 --> 01:24:53,120
- Maulavi Sir.
- Pundit!

578
01:24:53,455 --> 01:24:57,118
Yes. We will find the son too,
in the middle of the desert.

579
01:24:57,292 --> 01:25:00,090
That is okay.
But where is that middle?

580
01:25:00,328 --> 01:25:04,287
Is it in this world or outside,
on land or in the sky?

581
01:25:04,833 --> 01:25:08,997
You will come to know that on
reaching there. Now eat this.

582
01:25:09,471 --> 01:25:12,269
- I will not eat.
- Please eat for God's sake.

583
01:25:12,474 --> 01:25:15,841
- No. - Then atleast eat for
your stomach.

584
01:25:16,044 --> 01:25:18,979
- I will not eat.
- So you won't eat? - No.

585
01:25:19,180 --> 01:25:24,049
I am keeping it here.
Eat it if you feel hungry.

586
01:25:56,751 --> 01:26:01,211
Baba, you read your ' Namaz'.
Why don't you let me read it?

587
01:26:01,456 --> 01:26:06,052
This is our prayer, my child.
Your prayers are different.

588
01:26:06,327 --> 01:26:08,295
Why is it different, Baba?

589
01:26:08,463 --> 01:26:10,294
Because our religions
are different.

590
01:26:10,465 --> 01:26:12,023
What is a religion?

591
01:26:12,467 --> 01:26:15,800
The one that shows the path of
truth to humans.

592
01:26:16,037 --> 01:26:17,629
What is truth?

593
01:26:17,839 --> 01:26:22,435
- Whatever is not a lie or
sin? - What is a sin?

594
01:26:23,044 --> 01:26:25,342
Whatever is against the law
of God.

595
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:27,880
But what is law?

596
01:26:28,483 --> 01:26:31,611
Son, even I do not know
all that.

597
01:26:31,986 --> 01:26:37,288
I only know that you are a Hindu
and I am a Muslim.

598
01:26:37,425 --> 01:26:42,089
- Our prayers are different?
- Are our Gods different too?

599
01:26:42,430 --> 01:26:46,867
No. God is just one, who made
this Universe.

600
01:26:47,068 --> 01:26:49,730
But only the paths to reach
upto him are different.

601
01:26:50,004 --> 01:26:54,236
- But why is it so, Baba?
- I do not know that.

602
01:26:56,444 --> 01:26:58,036
What are you listening to?

603
01:26:58,446 --> 01:27:01,074
Just see! Old lady...

604
01:27:01,449 --> 01:27:06,978
This Hindu son of a Muslim
father will such a good human...

605
01:27:07,255 --> 01:27:10,190
...someday who will break the
useless walls of religion and...

606
01:27:10,458 --> 01:27:12,892
...Iight the lamps of happiness
in everyone's heart.

607
01:27:47,962 --> 01:27:48,656
Sheikh!

608
01:27:51,366 --> 01:27:52,833
This child has grown up
so fast.

609
01:27:54,902 --> 01:27:56,995
If my child would have been
alive today,...

610
01:27:57,205 --> 01:28:00,072
...he would have been
this big.

611
01:28:00,441 --> 01:28:01,601
Yes, Sheikh.

612
01:28:05,713 --> 01:28:08,614
Nanny, Mohammed's silence,...

613
01:28:08,816 --> 01:28:12,718
...his longing for a child,...

614
01:28:13,021 --> 01:28:16,115
...and tears in his eyes!
I cannot bear to see all that.

615
01:28:19,460 --> 01:28:22,293
I am indeed very unfortunate.

616
01:28:23,464 --> 01:28:25,932
I cannot give the happiness of
a child to my husband.

617
01:32:52,199 --> 01:32:55,293
Punditji, I gave you a
lot of trouble.

618
01:32:55,770 --> 01:32:57,567
Please forgive me.
I am leaving.

619
01:32:58,606 --> 01:33:00,767
Good bye!
Abdulla!

620
01:33:01,609 --> 01:33:06,171
- Good bye.
- See you again.

621
01:33:08,616 --> 01:33:10,311
I have never such a big liar
than him.

622
01:33:12,687 --> 01:33:14,678
Do not get angry, Pundit Sir!

623
01:33:14,989 --> 01:33:20,325
Do not look at the lie, but
at the motive behind the lie.

624
01:33:20,895 --> 01:33:24,922
After hearing the whole thing,
I am sure you will forgive him.

625
01:33:26,300 --> 01:33:27,927
It was a very dangerous night.

626
01:33:29,637 --> 01:33:32,333
As if disaster struck through
the sky.

627
01:33:42,850 --> 01:33:47,287
I wish everyone could do such
good tasks as you.

628
01:33:47,455 --> 01:33:51,414
By then, all the anger, hatred,
violence etc...

629
01:33:51,826 --> 01:33:54,624
...will automatically disappear
from this world.

630
01:33:55,463 --> 01:33:58,728
I have traveled for 10 days
in this hot desert.

631
01:33:59,033 --> 01:34:03,629
But even if I travel a 100 days
to meet a man like you...

632
01:34:03,838 --> 01:34:05,669
...it is like a pilgrimage
for you.

633
01:34:05,940 --> 01:34:08,738
Abdulla,
I am very happy to meet you.

634
01:34:08,943 --> 01:34:12,640
Krishna, come here, my child.

635
01:34:14,682 --> 01:34:15,774
Sit.

636
01:34:16,017 --> 01:34:18,850
Tell me how do you do your
prayers?

637
01:34:21,022 --> 01:34:24,685
Oh! I mean how do you pray?

638
01:34:32,967 --> 01:34:34,730
I read this every
night before sleeping.

639
01:34:35,002 --> 01:34:36,264
He just heard me and
learnt it.

640
01:34:36,437 --> 01:34:40,737
God quickly accepts prayers
said with a true heart.

641
01:34:41,008 --> 01:34:44,409
I read this prayer every
night before sleeping.

642
01:34:45,813 --> 01:34:49,715
I think he must learn his
prayers now.

643
01:34:50,017 --> 01:34:51,848
- Yes.
- Come on, say this.

644
01:35:01,462 --> 01:35:03,259
Learn it son. Now on,
these are your prayers.

645
01:35:03,464 --> 01:35:05,932
No problem.
He will learn it.

646
01:35:06,467 --> 01:35:09,630
It takes time to put him from
one mould into another.

647
01:35:12,339 --> 01:35:14,967
Panditji, it is time for my
Namaz. Excuse me.

648
01:35:15,176 --> 01:35:16,734
Sure.
Go ahead.

649
01:35:34,962 --> 01:35:36,088
Good you came, Khaleel.

650
01:35:36,630 --> 01:35:39,895
There is a bad news. Your
death and ruination...

651
01:35:40,067 --> 01:35:42,968
...will be due to a child.

652
01:35:43,437 --> 01:35:44,199
A child?

653
01:35:46,974 --> 01:35:49,966
Do not laugh.
Listen to me.

654
01:35:53,180 --> 01:35:56,980
Thousands of years ago,
a Krishna had come...

655
01:35:57,251 --> 01:36:00,414
...who had killed Kans.

656
01:36:02,656 --> 01:36:06,683
And now another Krishna has come
with your message of death.

657
01:36:07,027 --> 01:36:10,360
This Krishna is the son of
that woman...

658
01:36:10,831 --> 01:36:15,131
...whom you had killed in your
attack upon Aameer's caravan.

659
01:36:15,302 --> 01:36:18,100
Now he is growing up in
Abdulla's house,...

660
01:36:18,472 --> 01:36:20,667
...waiting for your death.

661
01:36:21,308 --> 01:36:24,869
Before Krishna becomes my death
and comes to kill me,...

662
01:36:25,179 --> 01:36:27,170
...I will finish him.

663
01:36:27,481 --> 01:36:30,575
Catch him and get him to the
old fort.

664
01:36:31,418 --> 01:36:35,821
I will sacrifice him and remove
his curse over your life.

665
01:36:48,435 --> 01:36:50,335
Come son, let us do the hair-
cutting ceremony first.

666
01:36:50,905 --> 01:36:53,806
Then we will put you the sacred
thread. Come.

667
01:37:18,666 --> 01:37:20,861
Keep quiet or I will get you
shaven up too.

668
01:38:25,666 --> 01:38:27,793
Priest Sir, this was given
by his mother.

669
01:38:30,905 --> 01:38:32,566
An 'Om'!

670
01:38:36,944 --> 01:38:37,740
Wear this 'Om' in your neck.

671
01:38:41,348 --> 01:38:42,315
Get up, son.

672
01:38:43,417 --> 01:38:44,714
Touch your father's feet.

673
01:38:48,422 --> 01:38:49,787
May you always be fine
and healthy.

674
01:38:51,425 --> 01:38:53,086
Go and play.

675
01:38:55,129 --> 01:38:57,654
- Everything went on well.
- Thank you very much.

676
01:38:57,898 --> 01:39:00,867
Tomorrow I shall take you
to the city.

677
01:39:01,435 --> 01:39:04,165
There, I will search for some
good Hindu family,...

678
01:39:04,305 --> 01:39:07,604
...and ask them to adopt
my Krishna,...

679
01:39:07,908 --> 01:39:11,935
...and allow this old man to lie
at their doorstep.

680
01:39:39,807 --> 01:39:41,365
Punditji, come with me.

681
01:39:55,289 --> 01:39:57,348
You old man,
you are still alive?

682
01:39:57,891 --> 01:40:00,883
I did not expect you to be alive
after so many years.

683
01:40:02,062 --> 01:40:03,051
Who is this?

684
01:40:03,430 --> 01:40:04,897
- Your son?
- Yes.

685
01:40:07,968 --> 01:40:09,367
Catch him.

686
01:40:18,312 --> 01:40:19,870
Brother, what are you doing?

687
01:40:35,629 --> 01:40:39,156
What have you done? Why did you
kill this innocent being?

688
01:40:40,100 --> 01:40:42,091
Baba!

689
01:40:42,936 --> 01:40:45,370
Leave my child.

690
01:40:50,944 --> 01:40:52,275
A Muslim, whose son is a
Hindu!

691
01:40:52,413 --> 01:40:54,176
What is his punishment?

692
01:40:54,782 --> 01:40:57,216
- Shall I kill him?
- No.

693
01:40:57,418 --> 01:40:59,750
This is a very easy death.

694
01:40:59,987 --> 01:41:03,946
Think of a way where he will
enjoy his pain...

695
01:41:04,124 --> 01:41:05,648
...and we will enjoy the sight.

696
01:41:05,993 --> 01:41:07,187
Go and get nails for his hands.

697
01:41:11,432 --> 01:41:12,922
Leave my Baba.

698
01:41:14,668 --> 01:41:16,602
Leave my Baba.

699
01:41:18,639 --> 01:41:23,736
Krishna! If he has even one
bruise, I will kill you all.

700
01:41:23,977 --> 01:41:26,605
- Leave me, you torturers.
- Shut up, old man.

701
01:41:27,948 --> 01:41:30,348
- I found just one nail.
- One is enough.

702
01:41:30,751 --> 01:41:33,845
Think of something by which he
dies and still not get peace.

703
01:41:34,021 --> 01:41:37,787
I will kill him like a dog
and bury him with a pig.

704
01:41:38,092 --> 01:41:42,222
Hang him and nail him.

705
01:41:57,077 --> 01:42:00,012
This is a punishment which will
not spare him even after death.

706
01:42:00,214 --> 01:42:03,741
The God of Hindus will never
accept his soul.

707
01:42:03,984 --> 01:42:06,179
And Allah will shower mayhem
over his soul.

708
01:42:06,420 --> 01:42:10,584
And the God of Christians will
be furious to see,...

709
01:42:10,891 --> 01:42:12,722
...an old fool on the
gallows.

710
01:42:12,993 --> 01:42:16,292
His impure soul will keep
wandering till doomsday.

711
01:42:25,939 --> 01:42:27,702
See the results your father
is bearing!

712
01:42:37,384 --> 01:42:38,715
Take him away.

713
01:42:38,952 --> 01:42:41,113
Take away all useful things.

714
01:42:41,255 --> 01:42:42,813
And put the house on fire.

715
01:43:03,610 --> 01:43:04,577
Take this.

716
01:43:08,315 --> 01:43:10,943
Listen. Do not give trouble
to him.

717
01:43:11,418 --> 01:43:15,377
Or else, God will be really
angry with you.

718
01:43:20,127 --> 01:43:20,957
Let us go from here.

719
01:43:29,903 --> 01:43:33,168
Son, I will surely come to
save you one day.

720
01:43:33,440 --> 01:43:36,204
Die slowly after a lot of
pain.

721
01:43:37,644 --> 01:43:42,809
Khaleel, you may go to any
corner of the world.

722
01:43:42,983 --> 01:43:45,315
I will follow you.

723
01:43:46,453 --> 01:43:48,819
I will not spare you.

724
01:44:20,487 --> 01:44:23,752
They kidnapped you too?
What is your name?

725
01:44:24,024 --> 01:44:26,015
What is this thing?

726
01:44:28,362 --> 01:44:30,193
Is it made of silver?
Give it to me.

727
01:44:30,430 --> 01:44:34,833
No. I will not give it to you.
My father has given it to me.

728
01:44:35,002 --> 01:44:36,731
This is my mother's symbol.

729
01:44:37,004 --> 01:44:39,131
Alright. I will steal
it on my own.

730
01:45:47,040 --> 01:45:49,167
He is coming into the death
on his own.

731
01:46:04,658 --> 01:46:05,420
Wait!

732
01:46:40,660 --> 01:46:42,287
Tell us where is Khaleel.

733
01:46:42,429 --> 01:46:44,260
I do not know.

734
01:46:44,631 --> 01:46:47,156
Leave him.
Let me ask him.

735
01:47:12,659 --> 01:47:15,958
You dog!
Tell us where is Khaleel.

736
01:47:16,730 --> 01:47:18,857
I am telling you.

737
01:47:21,468 --> 01:47:22,025
Poor Sheikh Mohammed.

738
01:47:22,469 --> 01:47:25,632
He has been getting fooled by
me since years.

739
01:47:25,839 --> 01:47:29,935
Now he must be waiting for me
over there.

740
01:47:30,110 --> 01:47:32,374
And l...

741
01:47:54,634 --> 01:47:58,035
You have sent your men for
misleading Mohammed.

742
01:47:58,205 --> 01:48:02,266
- What about them? - They know
to protect themselves.

743
01:48:02,976 --> 01:48:08,209
It is alright even if they
or they don't.

744
01:48:13,820 --> 01:48:15,788
So, you are eating now?

745
01:48:17,457 --> 01:48:19,186
You father had said,
do not touch this.

746
01:48:19,459 --> 01:48:20,790
Or we all will get ruined.

747
01:48:24,664 --> 01:48:27,428
And your father had also said,
he will follow him till the end.

748
01:48:28,835 --> 01:48:29,665
Where is he?

749
01:48:30,403 --> 01:48:32,234
He has not come yet.

750
01:48:37,677 --> 01:48:40,578
If you stare at me like this,...

751
01:48:40,881 --> 01:48:43,372
...I will remove your eyes with
the edge of this dagger.

752
01:48:47,654 --> 01:48:52,717
I know that you are praying to
your God for my destroyal.

753
01:48:54,628 --> 01:48:59,656
Just as your father prays to
Allah! Where is your God?

754
01:48:59,900 --> 01:49:02,095
Where is Abdulla's God?

755
01:49:02,269 --> 01:49:03,759
No one can do anything to me.

756
01:49:50,617 --> 01:49:52,312
Come on, fire!
Quickly!

757
01:52:46,626 --> 01:52:48,992
Sheikh, we have arrested all
the rest of Khaleel's men.

758
01:52:49,162 --> 01:52:51,027
- But Khaleel is not found yet.
- I know it.

759
01:52:51,397 --> 01:52:52,864
Spread our men all around.

760
01:55:09,469 --> 01:55:10,060
My child, I have lost.

761
01:55:14,474 --> 01:55:16,135
I wish he was not born out of
my own hands.

762
01:55:16,843 --> 01:55:21,644
It would have been better if he
had remained in your womb.

763
01:55:23,016 --> 01:55:28,113
I would have been relieved that
mother and child are together.

764
01:55:35,428 --> 01:55:38,056
Allah! What kind of
justice is yours!

765
01:55:38,197 --> 01:55:41,394
What is this Godliness of yours?

766
01:55:42,435 --> 01:55:45,404
Whose God are you?

767
01:55:45,805 --> 01:55:49,332
You snatched my child from me.

768
01:55:50,443 --> 01:55:53,037
I will not worship that God
anymore.

769
01:55:55,448 --> 01:56:00,215
Now on you are not my God and
I am not your devotee.

770
01:56:33,419 --> 01:56:35,250
What is this, Salma?

771
01:56:35,688 --> 01:56:37,087
Even you have gone?

772
01:56:39,625 --> 01:56:41,354
One by one, everyone has
gone away.

773
01:56:43,296 --> 01:56:46,026
Even I am very tired of life.

774
01:56:50,436 --> 01:56:51,596
Take an oath.

775
01:56:52,638 --> 01:56:54,629
You will look after him.

776
01:57:02,648 --> 01:57:03,774
Take an oath, Baba.

777
01:57:08,321 --> 01:57:09,845
Yes, my child.
I promise!

778
01:57:10,156 --> 01:57:14,183
As long as I live, I will
protect your child.

779
01:57:33,946 --> 01:57:36,915
Friend, give me this piece
of Silver.

780
01:57:39,419 --> 01:57:40,750
Take this.

781
01:57:54,434 --> 01:57:54,923
Khaleel is laughing.

782
01:57:55,968 --> 01:57:59,927
Baba, do not cry.
I will help you.

783
01:58:00,440 --> 01:58:03,637
I will save you Baba.

784
01:58:05,445 --> 01:58:06,605
Mohammed!

785
01:58:09,882 --> 01:58:12,077
He was just now calling for
his Baba.

786
01:58:12,452 --> 01:58:15,387
He said, Khaleel did a lot of
torture to his Baba.

787
01:58:16,456 --> 01:58:19,084
Search for his Baba in any case.

788
01:58:24,464 --> 01:58:26,955
Mother!

789
01:58:32,939 --> 01:58:34,907
Did you hear that?
Mohammed, he called me a mother.

790
01:58:50,957 --> 01:58:53,221
Mohammed, it is about to
be evening.

791
01:58:53,426 --> 01:58:55,223
And even Krishna is tired.

792
01:58:56,863 --> 01:58:57,887
Let us halt here for the night.

793
01:59:10,877 --> 01:59:14,005
Khaleel, since the time Krishna
has come to your life,...

794
01:59:14,247 --> 01:59:16,408
...you are going on getting
defeated.

795
01:59:16,816 --> 01:59:19,114
And if you do not
kill him soon,...

796
01:59:19,285 --> 01:59:22,118
...then defeat and destruction
will kill you.

797
01:59:25,958 --> 01:59:28,085
Mohammed is going to halt here
for the night.

798
01:59:28,261 --> 01:59:30,354
- Listen!
- Yes, Boss?

799
01:59:30,663 --> 01:59:32,631
Keep a close watch on Krishna.

800
01:59:57,356 --> 01:59:59,256
- Mohammed!
- What is the matter?

801
01:59:59,425 --> 02:00:01,655
- Krishna is missing! - Where
has he gone? - I do not know.

802
02:00:01,894 --> 02:00:04,590
Don't get scared.
I will search for him.

803
02:00:45,171 --> 02:00:47,799
- Sir, Krishna is not here.
- Where is Krishna?

804
02:00:50,643 --> 02:00:52,907
- Where is he?
- I will not tell you.

805
02:00:53,779 --> 02:00:56,907
- I know where is Krishna.
- No. Don't tell him.

806
02:01:03,623 --> 02:01:07,821
- Where is Krishna? - Coward!
you are after an innocent kid?

807
02:01:08,027 --> 02:01:10,120
If you are man enough, raise
yours sword and fight with me.

808
02:01:16,135 --> 02:01:17,625
I am asking you for the
last time,...

809
02:01:17,903 --> 02:01:19,666
...tell me where is Krishna.

810
02:01:19,905 --> 02:01:22,237
I will never tell you that.

811
02:02:46,559 --> 02:02:48,925
Krishna, my child!

812
02:03:09,715 --> 02:03:13,811
I have got ruined because of
him.

813
02:03:14,086 --> 02:03:17,715
Now neither your Krishna will
remain, nor my ruination.

814
02:03:17,990 --> 02:03:21,448
No, Khaleel. Fear God.
Do not be so torturous.

815
02:03:21,894 --> 02:03:26,058
Spare this child.
Take my life instead.

816
02:03:26,532 --> 02:03:27,692
Leave this child

817
02:03:31,203 --> 02:03:32,830
Tie this child.

818
02:03:44,817 --> 02:03:46,978
See for the house for the
last time, old man!

819
02:04:17,049 --> 02:04:20,780
I have heard that he is your
and your beauty's victim.

820
02:04:21,053 --> 02:04:24,819
I will turn your beauty
into ugliness.

821
02:04:26,592 --> 02:04:30,084
Sheikh will keep on screaming
on seeing your face.

822
02:04:30,229 --> 02:04:34,256
Khaleel, it is time for
Krishna's sacrifice.

823
02:04:34,600 --> 02:04:36,124
Kill him quickly.

824
02:04:36,402 --> 02:04:38,927
No, you torturers.

825
02:04:39,171 --> 02:04:40,763
You coward!

826
02:04:41,807 --> 02:04:44,776
You have no courage to face
a woman?

827
02:04:45,077 --> 02:04:50,310
Free me. I will cut you into
pieces and send you to hell.

828
02:04:50,549 --> 02:04:51,709
Wait.

829
02:04:52,384 --> 02:04:55,148
This lioness is roaring a lot.

830
02:04:57,022 --> 02:04:58,387
Let me tackle her first.

831
02:04:59,558 --> 02:05:02,925
You talk too much.

832
02:05:03,562 --> 02:05:06,759
Just open me once. I will
use the sword equally.

833
02:05:11,036 --> 02:05:14,028
Your wish will never be
fulfilled.

834
02:05:14,573 --> 02:05:18,532
Mohammed will come now and
finish you off.

835
02:05:18,944 --> 02:05:22,402
We have also made arrangements
for his death.

836
02:05:27,353 --> 02:05:30,083
Khaleel, the time for the
sacrifice is passing quickly.

837
02:05:30,589 --> 02:05:31,920
Kill the child quickly.

838
02:05:51,310 --> 02:05:52,902
Start! Kill him.

839
02:05:55,548 --> 02:05:56,071
No, Khaleel.

840
02:05:56,916 --> 02:05:59,885
Allah, help me.

841
02:08:56,028 --> 02:08:57,017
Greetings!

842
02:09:02,534 --> 02:09:04,968
You idiots! Where is Khaleel?

843
02:09:05,537 --> 02:09:06,299
Thank you.

844
02:09:50,516 --> 02:09:51,244
Do not come forward.

845
02:09:51,517 --> 02:09:53,280
Or I will finish the child.

846
02:09:53,519 --> 02:09:56,352
If Krishna gets even one
bruise...

847
02:09:56,522 --> 02:10:00,322
...you will face a very
dangerous death.

848
02:10:02,060 --> 02:10:03,493
I am asking you to wait.

849
02:10:04,530 --> 02:10:06,725
You remained a coward all
your life.

850
02:10:06,999 --> 02:10:09,433
Atleast show some bravery
before dying.

851
02:13:53,091 --> 02:13:54,388
Mohammed!

852
02:14:01,800 --> 02:14:04,234
I am handing over...

853
02:14:04,569 --> 02:14:08,061
...my Krishna to you.

854
02:14:51,550 --> 02:14:53,450
My child!

855
02:14:56,555 --> 02:14:58,955
Son, you have undergone lot
of trouble.

856
02:14:59,558 --> 02:15:02,322
You searched for me and
called me here from lndia...

857
02:15:02,561 --> 02:15:04,791
...to unite me with my child
Krishna.

858
02:15:04,930 --> 02:15:07,228
How can I thank you, son?

859
02:15:07,566 --> 02:15:09,329
There is nothing to thank me,
mother.

860
02:15:10,569 --> 02:15:14,164
Abdulla wished that Krishna must
get a good Hindu family.

861
02:15:14,573 --> 02:15:19,237
I consider myself lucky that l
could unite you with Krishna.

862
02:15:19,578 --> 02:15:22,445
Son, for me, you are a
form of God.

863
02:15:23,248 --> 02:15:26,081
Come my child.

864
02:15:26,585 --> 02:15:29,315
She is your grandmother.

865
02:15:29,588 --> 02:15:30,077
Come, my child!

866
02:15:34,593 --> 02:15:37,289
