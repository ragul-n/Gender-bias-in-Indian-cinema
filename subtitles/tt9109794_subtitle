1
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,200
"He is a murderer."

2
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:20,960
"He is a murderer."

3
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,840
'KOLAIGARAN'

4
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,720
"A murderer.."

5
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:12,040
"A murderer."

6
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,160
Hello.
- Sir

7
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,760
Prabhakaran has turned himself in
at R1 police station.

8
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,800
We haven't taken his
confession statement yet.

9
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,080
ADGP wants you here immediately.

10
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,760
I shall inform the area VAO too.

11
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,040
No, wait until I reach there.

12
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,200
Okay, sir.

13
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,520
Sir, he doesn't look like a killer.

14
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,000
We haven't informed the VAO yet.

15
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,200
I heard you ordered not to.
But why, sir?

16
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,960
First, let's hear his confession.

17
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,800
Go ahead.

18
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,920
'Smoking and drinking alcohol
are injurious to health.'

19
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,840
"Don't take my life away.."

20
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,480
"The marks of your love in my heart
won't heal."

21
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,200
"Don't you run away
after breathing fire into me."

22
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,160
"The taste of your kisses
will remain with me forever."

23
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:59,400
"Here I am, standing thirsty for
your love in the middle of a sea."

24
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:03,200
"I'm shivering. Don't you see me?"

25
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:09,040
"You are the only one
in all my dreams and I am.."

26
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:16,600
"Waiting for you, my dear!
I am all alone!"

27
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:23,640
"Waiting for you, my dear!
I am all alone!"

28
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,720
"Don't take my life away.."

29
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,480
"The marks of your love in my heart
won't heal."

30
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:36,440
"Don't you run away
after breathing fire into me."

31
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:40,080
"The taste of your kisses
will remain with me forever."

32
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,120
"Here I am, standing thirsty for
your love in the middle of a sea."

33
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:48,120
"I'm shivering. Don't you see me?"

34
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:54,560
"You are the only one
in all my dreams and I am.."

35
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,240
"I am all alone!"

36
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,080
"I am all alone!"

37
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,680
"When you are not around, I can
feel the darkness surround me."

38
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:40,600
"It's because you are my light
and you are all I see."

39
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,120
"Why can't we unite?"

40
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,800
"Where did my love fall short
and went in vain?"

41
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,760
"So far away from me..
Is that you?"

42
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,760
"Can't we eliminate
this space between us"

43
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,160
"and make our dreams come true?"

44
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:06,400
"Even the sea can't match
the love we have for each other."

45
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,240
"Don't look for me.
I'm just a sacrifice in your love."

46
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,040
"I will neither let go of you
nor forget you."

47
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,720
"But where do I look for you?"

48
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:23,720
"Waiting for you, my dear!
I am all alone!"

49
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:31,080
"Waiting for you, my dear!
I am all alone!"

50
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:36,440
"Don't take my life away.."

51
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,880
"The marks of your love in my heart
won't heal."

52
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,880
"Don't you run away
after breathing fire into me."

53
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,560
"The taste of your kisses
will remain with me forever."

54
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,600
"Here I am, standing thirsty for
your love in the middle of a sea."

55
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,320
"I'm shivering. Don't you see me?"

56
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:02,280
"You are the only one
in all my dreams and I am.."

57
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,520
"I am all alone!"

58
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:15,760
"Waiting for you, my dear!
I am all alone!"

59
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:44,360
'Last night, in two separate
incidents on the East coast road'

60
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,800
'two youngsters from Chennai'

61
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,120
'were brutally attacked
under mysterious conditions.'

62
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,480
'They were in a life-threatening
state when found by the police.'

63
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,480
'Further, a complaint was lodged..'

64
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:57,400
'The nomadic males will have
to fend for themselves completely.'

65
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,160
'The unconscious youngsters
are admitted in the hospital.'

66
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,960
'While the identity of the attacker
is still a mystery'

67
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,720
'it has been reported that the duo
could be a part of some gang.'

68
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,640
'Because the police have found out
that there are already cases'

69
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,400
'registered against them
in the police station.'

70
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,040
Bye, Mom.

71
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,800
Hello.

72
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,160
Hi.

73
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,680
Hi, Roopa
- Hi.

74
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,720
So, did he again step out
at the same time as you did?

75
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,600
Look, we can call it a coincidence
if this happened once or twice.

76
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,800
But how does he step out
at the same time as you do?

77
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,200
That too, every single day?

78
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,240
Don't you think it's too much?

79
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,600
Why should we think
about it unnecessarily?

80
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,880
He doesn't seem to be a bad person.

81
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,080
Do you know what I feel about it?

82
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,360
He wakes up, gets ready

83
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,320
waits for you to step out
and only then he steps out.

84
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,440
I'm sure he is interested in you.

85
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,080
It's okay if he
is in love with you.

86
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,040
But if he turns out to be a stalker
or an obsessive lover

87
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,520
then it's dangerous.

88
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,400
Please be careful.

89
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,000
I guess you're watching
too many movies.

90
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,240
Stop scaring me early
in the morning. Shut up!

91
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,080
Didn't Prabhakaran come
to office today?

92
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,880
He informed you yesterday
that he would be on leave today.

93
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,080
Did you forget?

94
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,000
I would have remembered if he had
asked for my permission.

95
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,000
But all he does is just give
information, right?

96
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,520
Isn't he a bit strange?

97
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,760
He comes in, minds his own
business and leaves.

98
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,120
At times, it's scary
to even talk to him.

99
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,720
Hello.
- I found the address, sir.

100
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,160
I will share the location now.

101
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,680
But please do not reveal
that I helped you.

102
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,320
Sir.

103
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,720
What happened?

104
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,840
Kotai is no more.

105
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,440
Babu?
- He is still comatose.

106
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,880
If he wakes up,
we can find out who did this.

107
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,760
But it doesn't look
like he will wake up.

108
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,240
'In 0.1 mile, take right.'

109
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,640
'You have reached
your destination.'

110
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,280
Bye, Mom.

111
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,040
Hi.
- Hi.

112
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,440
No, mom agreed.
My dad is..

113
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,640
Mr. Senthil.
- Yes, ma'am?

114
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,160
Drop me here.
- Ok, ma'am.

115
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,640
Roaming around town..

116
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,560
Shall I marry someone else?
I will thrash you.

117
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,160
Bye, Roopa.
- Bye.

118
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,400
Open the door, Dharini!

119
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,480
Dharini?
- Mom.

120
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,920
Dharini..
- Mom..

121
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,320
Dharini.

122
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,280
What happened?

123
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,240
Vamsi..

124
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,840
Vamsi is here, Mom.

125
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
What do you mean?

126
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,240
I had been to the supermarket.

127
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,000
I saw him there.

128
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,280
I am sure he is here for us.

129
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,440
Could it be him?

130
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,400
I don't know.

131
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,920
But I escaped
without him noticing me.

132
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,320
Who is it?
- The EB guy, ma'am.

133
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,560
Hello, control room.

134
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,440
Sir, I'm calling from the warehouse
road at Vyasarpadi.

135
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,360
There is a corpse lying in the
ground next to the warehouse.

136
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,440
Control room to Vyasarpadi patrol.

137
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,520
Control room to Vyasarpadi patrol.

138
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,720
Vyasarpadi patrol reporting.

139
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,480
Our location
is Erukkancheri high road.

140
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,520
There is a gathering
at the warehouse road.

141
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,080
Please check and report back.

142
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,840
Vyasarpadi patrol to control room.

143
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,120
We are at the spot.

144
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,760
It looks like CrPC suspect.
Please send in more force.

145
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:18,960
Sir!

146
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,280
Did the crowd contaminate
the crime scene?

147
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,880
A few people were here before us.

148
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,720
Once the force got here,
everything is under control

149
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,680
Everything is in order, sir.

150
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,040
Who gave the information?
- Someone staying here.

151
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,080
They called 100.

152
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,560
Did you call for the ambulance?
- On its way, sir.

153
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,560
What about Rani?
- Informed. On the way.

154
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,640
Sir, Rani is here.

155
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,880
Give me a pen
- Sir.

156
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,880
Here you go, sir.

157
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,360
Sir, ADGP is here.
- Oh.

158
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,760
Sir!

159
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,640
CrPC suspect, sir.

160
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,760
The body is burnt.

161
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,920
The face is damaged to the extent
that it is unrecognisable.

162
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,880
But it doesn't appear
to be done by a gang.

163
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,440
We can move further
in this case

164
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,720
only after identifying the corpse.

165
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,080
Not committed by a gang
sounds dangerous.

166
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,040
I want you to form a team at once

167
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,600
and start the investigation.
- Okay, sir.

168
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,960
See how quickly you can
identify the corpse. - Yes, sir.

169
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,480
Get me the report
as soon as possible. - Sure, sir.

170
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,560
Bring in that person
who saw it first.

171
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,560
I was the one who called 100.

172
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,480
Last night, I was on my way back
home after work at around 8:30.

173
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,040
I noticed something was
burning at a distance.

174
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,200
I thought the kids must've
set the garbage on fire.

175
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,720
But when I saw in the morning,
it was a corpse.

176
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,840
You may leave.
- Okay, sir.

177
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,400
Sir, Rani couldn't sniff
out any clue.

178
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,640
What do we do now, sir?
- Murali. - Sir.

179
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:16,160
The trouser worn by the deceased
was tailor-made. It's half burnt.

180
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,360
'ABAD' can be seen
on the tailor's label.

181
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,200
Maybe it's 'Hyderabad',
'Allahabad'.. Something like that.

182
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,280
So, the deceased might
not be from here.

183
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,560
You do one thing..
- Sir.

184
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,680
Check if any hotel
or lodges in the city

185
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,400
have filed a missing
person complaint.

186
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,920
Okay? - Okay, sir. - That'll be
good for now. - Sure, sir.

187
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,040
Hello.

188
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,800
Hello.

189
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,760
Hello.

190
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,680
It's me, Prabhakaran.

191
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,720
Tell me.

192
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,560
I hope everything is fine there.

193
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:18,480
I hope everything is normal.
- Yes.

194
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,280
There is no problem here.

195
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,680
Tell me.
What is the matter?

196
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,440
Dharini..
- Dharini?

197
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,040
Dharini is quite scared.

198
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,680
Pass the phone to Dharini.

199
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,320
Tell me.

200
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,800
Are you very scared?

201
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,320
No..

202
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,360
Yes
- Keep this in mind.

203
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,080
The calmer you are

204
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:51,680
the easier it will be
to handle this issue.

205
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,280
I am sorry.

206
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,160
One more thing.

207
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,720
The police have found the corpse.

208
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,640
You must have read
about it in the newspaper.

209
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,640
But there is no need to fear.

210
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,520
Everything is going
on as per the plan.

211
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:10,960
Apart from us, does anyone else
know that we are communicating?

212
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,080
No. No one knows.

213
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,000
Please maintain it
as it is.

214
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,200
Do not reveal anything to anyone.

215
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,080
If you have anything
to tell me

216
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,960
do so when I call you.

217
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,960
Sounds good?
- Okay.

218
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:27,840
Fine, I'll hang up now.

219
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,240
Just a minute.

220
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,720
Please tell me.

221
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,520
Thanks.

222
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,320
Thanks for everything.

223
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,360
It's okay.

224
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,400
The victim was strangled to death.

225
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,640
Then a rock was used
to disfigure the face.

226
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,520
The body was set ablaze.

227
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,480
If he was set ablaze
when he was alive

228
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,560
he would have inhaled the smoke.

229
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,800
But there is no smell
of smoke in the lungs.

230
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,520
What was used to strangle
the victim?

231
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,280
Must be a cable or a wire.

232
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,440
Look at the skull.

233
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,120
It's completely smashed!

234
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,480
It has been smashed in a way
that it can't be reconstructed.

235
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:33,560
He must be very strong. Otherwise,
it's impossible to do this.

236
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,920
Doctor.

237
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,080
Can you tell us the date
and time of death?

238
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,400
February 6th.

239
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,000
Between 8 to 9 in the night.

240
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,200
Is it approximate?

241
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,880
Accurate!

242
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,720
Get me some coffee.
- Okay, sir.

243
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,920
Any leads, Karthikeyan?
- Sir..

244
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,880
We cross-checked the fingerprints
with the criminal records

245
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,920
and we found no match.

246
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,840
There is too much sugar..
- As per the forensic reports

247
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,680
the corpse was set ablaze
using petrol. - Sir.

248
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,680
Everything has taken place
in a hurried manner.

249
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,040
The entire body wasn't
doused in petrol

250
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,960
which is why it is half burnt.

251
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,200
Sir, it seems like
an amateur killer.

252
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,320
Yes, sir!

253
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,400
We'll keep you posted.

254
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,680
Sir!

255
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,520
Sir.
- Thank you

256
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,200
Sir.

257
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:24,280
A guest is missing from
the Picnic Lodge near Central.

258
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,360
But his luggage
is still in the room.

259
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,880
The lodge didn't file
any missing complaint.

260
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,400
We found out while inquiring.

261
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,120
The missing guest's address
shows that he is from Hyderabad.

262
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,560
Where are you taking me?

263
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,440
I asked you
where you are taking me.

264
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:14,240
Listen, if I don't like the place
you are taking me

265
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,680
then I will be pissed off!

266
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,080
And if I get pissed off,
our whole day will be spoiled.

267
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,080
I hope you don't want
that to happen.

268
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,000
So, please tell me.
Where are we going?

269
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:27,600
Hey, I'm more concerned than you
that this day shouldn't get ruined.

270
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,920
So, don't worry about the place.
I'm sure you'll like it.

271
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,360
I will like it for sure.

272
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,760
But I hate surprises.

273
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
So, please tell me.
Where are we going?

274
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,960
This is the name and address
of the guest.

275
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,040
The entrance to reception
and room are different.

276
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,200
So, only if the guest drops
off the room key with us

277
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,640
we will know
that he has stepped out.

278
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,480
Okay. So, until what time
was he in the room?

279
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,560
Sir, we thought he was in the room
till yesterday morning.

280
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,720
But only in the evening
we found out that he wasn't.

281
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,720
Immediately, I asked his luggage
to be removed from the room.

282
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,720
I would like to see
the CCTV footage.

283
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,720
Sir, this hotel is exclusively
for elite customers.

284
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:00,480
So, we haven't installed CCTV
cameras for their privacy.

285
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,880
What's your name?
- Vignesh, sir.

286
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,480
Jagan.
- Sir.

287
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,160
Give me.. - Here
- No, thank you, sir.

288
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,440
Take it, man!

289
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,960
What do they mean they haven't
installed CCTV? - Unbelievable!

290
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,480
You guys are too innocent.

291
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,080
It seems, even the best hospital
doesn't have CCTV.

292
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,000
Didn't the people believe that?

293
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,000
Yes, sir.
We totally forgot about it.

294
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,760
That's our fate!
- Sir.. Just a minute.

295
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,680
What?
- The manager lied to you.

296
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,600
Good boy.

297
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,960
When I checked on February 6th,
there was no one in the room.

298
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,440
The business was dull,
so he let the room be

299
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,040
in the guest's name
for as long as possible.

300
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,440
The advance he paid
got over yesterday.

301
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,240
That's why he asked me
to clear out the room.

302
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,160
Please don't tell them
that I revealed this to you.

303
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,240
Shall I open the door, sir?
- It's okay. No need.

304
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,320
Jagan.
- Sir..

305
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,800
Ask the forensic people to come.
- Sure, sir.

306
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,560
You may come in, sir.

307
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,800
Okay.

308
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,080
Let's get started, Muruganandam.

309
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,720
Anything interesting?

310
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,480
The corpse's fingerprint
and the fingerprint

311
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,800
from the hotel
are a perfect match.

312
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,600
We also got a hair sample
from the hotel.

313
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:46,240
It's a perfect DNA match
with the corpse.

314
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,960
The victim's name

315
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,160
is Vamsi Kabirdas.

316
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,400
The younger brother of a minister
in Andhra Pradesh

317
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,520
Mr. Sathyanarayanan Kabirdas.

318
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,800
We inquired about the victim.

319
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,960
He has a very bad name.

320
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,600
For a long time,
he had his eye set

321
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,400
on the daughter
of his brother's secretary.

322
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,240
Her father handled things
until the time he was alive.

323
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:30,240
But after his death,
he tortured her mom and her a lot.

324
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,840
Unable to bear his torture,
they moved to Chennai.

325
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,440
He was searching for them
for the past two years.

326
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,960
Recently, he found out
that they are here

327
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,000
and he came to Chennai.

328
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,200
And he has been murdered.

329
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,920
Case of stalking, sir.

330
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,480
We can nab the killer soon.

331
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,960
Sathyanarayanan has already
received the information.

332
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,160
I have been requested to hand
this case to my best officer.

333
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,880
Vijaykumar.

334
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:01,320
Distribute all the cases handled
by Karthikeyan to others.

335
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,320
I want his full attention
on this case.

336
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,360
Okay, sir.
- And, sir.

337
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,960
We have found out the whereabouts
of that woman and her daughter.

338
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,280
So

339
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,560
I'll start my investigation
from them.

340
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,920
Who is Lakshmi?
- That'd be me.

341
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,160
We are coming
from the police station.

342
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,040
The inspector is here
for an inquiry.

343
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,040
Please come in.

344
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,280
What happened, Mom?
- They are from the police station.

345
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,200
They want to do an inquiry.

346
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,600
How long have you
been staying here?

347
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,800
Two years.

348
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,960
Who all live here?

349
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,240
Just my daughter and me.

350
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,600
Your husband?

351
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,520
Her father is no more.

352
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,800
And your husband?

353
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,840
What was his occupation?

354
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:13,400
He was Minister Sathyanarayanan's
personal secretary.

355
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,440
At Hyderabad?

356
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:18,080
Yes - So were you staying
in Hyderabad earlier?

357
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,680
Yes
- What's your occupation?

358
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:25,440
I don't work.
My daughter's working.

359
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,120
At Wonsoon.

360
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,960
As a customer care executive.

361
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,040
What was the reason for shifting
from Hyderabad?

362
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,280
Due to the minister's
younger brother.

363
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:35,880
I don't understand.

364
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:39,880
We had to shift here because of
Sathyanarayanan's brother, Vamsi.

365
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,120
Why?

366
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,160
He..

367
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,680
His character is not good.

368
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,880
He came to our house often
and misbehaved with us.

369
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,800
We had to go through a lot
of torture because of him.

370
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,880
We couldn't seek anyone's help.

371
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,600
So, we secretly moved to Chennai.

372
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,600
Sir, what's the problem?

373
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,520
May I know why we
are being questioned?

374
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,440
I'll tell you.

375
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,880
But before that..

376
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,200
When and where did
you see Vamsi last?

377
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,320
It must be around two years ago.

378
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,520
We haven't seen him
ever since we came here.

379
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,040
Really?

380
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,800
Yes.

381
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,200
Where were you both on February 6th
and what were you doing?

382
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,560
Feb 6th..

383
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,760
Last Thursday

384
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,840
I had been to the office.

385
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,320
When did you return?

386
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,160
Evening around 6:30.

387
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,120
Usually, the workload
is more on Thursdays.

388
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,920
My friend, Latha,
had dropped me off.

389
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,360
Can you recollect what you did
after you arrived home?

390
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:57,960
I didn't step out.
We were at home.

391
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,400
Okay.

392
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,080
It's nothing..

393
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,160
Vamsi had come to Chennai
looking for you.

394
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,880
And he got murdered.

395
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,320
Upon inquiring we got to know
that his character was not good.

396
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,720
Don't you worry.
These are just basic formalities.

397
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,800
I'll come and meet you
if need be.

398
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,320
Please cooperate.

399
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,600
Are we done here?
- Yes, sir.

400
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,720
Thank you so much.

401
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,760
Jagan.
- Sir.

402
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,840
Wait downstairs. I'll be back
in five minutes. - Okay, sir.

403
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,120
DCP Karthikeyan.
Can I talk to you?

404
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,520
Sorry to bother you.

405
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,520
How well do you know the woman

406
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,720
and her daughter
living across?

407
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,040
Not much.

408
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,640
Whenever I see them,
I smile. That's all.

409
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,160
Apart from that, nothing much.

410
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,280
Why do you ask?

411
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,280
Well, it's related
to an investigation.

412
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,680
And on February,
I think on the 6th..

413
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,320
Did you notice anything unusual?

414
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,360
Define unusual.

415
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,760
Any visitors they had,
any noise, something like that.

416
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,280
I usually return home
at 6 p.m. after work.

417
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,280
After that, I don't step out.

418
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,720
So if they had any visitors when
I wasn't home, I wouldn't know.

419
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:46,480
And I didn't hear
any unusual noise.

420
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,080
Okay.

421
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,800
Okay!

422
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,680
Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

423
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,200
I believe they are telling
the truth, sir.

424
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,560
Sir, I don't think they both
could have done this.

425
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,480
First, cross-check and find out
if that girl is speaking the truth.

426
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,520
What is her friend's name?
- Latha, sir.

427
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,640
Latha.

428
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,320
Inquire her.
- Okay, sir.

429
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,200
Hello.

430
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,960
It's me, Prabhakaran.
- Tell me.

431
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,840
Did an inspector come
to your house yesterday?

432
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,040
Yes, he did.

433
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,400
What did he ask you?

434
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:33,200
He asked us exactly
what you said he would.

435
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,880
What was your reply?

436
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:38,560
I told them exactly
what you had asked me to tell.

437
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,320
Do you think he believed it?

438
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,720
That's how it appeared.

439
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:48,400
Because after that,
he didn't ask anything more.

440
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,040
Is there anything else?

441
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,160
What do you mean?

442
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,160
Nothing.

443
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,080
Don't worry.

444
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,040
All these problems

445
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,080
will come to an end soon.

446
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,440
I will hang up now.

447
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,480
Do you think he believed it?

448
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,880
That's how it appeared.

449
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,400
Because after that,
he didn't ask anything more.

450
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,280
Don't worry.

451
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,480
All these problems

452
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,120
will come to an end soon.

453
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,680
'Will all the problems
truly come to an end?'

454
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,360
'Or am I giving them
false hopes?'

455
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,880
Why are you thinking too much?

456
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,040
What did you ask?

457
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,800
I asked why you are
thinking too much.

458
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:05,400
I trust you more than
you trust yourself.

459
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,640
Until you are here,
nothing will happen to me.

460
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,480
Got it?

461
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:22,000
You are too good
at reading my mind.

462
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,520
I don't know about others.

463
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,760
But I can read
your mind very well.

464
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,360
Do you really know me that well?

465
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:37,280
"Come closer and let me feel
that soft hug of yours."

466
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:42,080
"Come closer and let me feel
that soft love of yours."

467
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:48,840
"Come closer and let me feel
all of that softness in you."

468
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:56,600
"Come closer and let me feel
that soft hug of yours."

469
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,840
"Come closer and let me feel
that soft love of yours."

470
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:08,960
"Come closer and with all your
softness, make me feel alive."

471
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:16,400
"Let me feel
that soft kiss of yours."

472
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:21,240
"Let's put an end
to the shyness between us."

473
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:26,680
"Do you hear my heart"

474
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,760
"calling out your name?"

475
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:35,920
"Come closer and let me
feel that soft hug of yours."

476
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:41,200
"Come closer and let me feel
that soft love of yours."

477
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:48,320
"Come closer and with all your
softness, make me feel alive."

478
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:16,160
"Every moment without you,
burns me down slowly."

479
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:20,800
"Come back to me and save me."

480
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:25,960
"These sleepless,
lonely nights are new to me."

481
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:29,840
"Come back to me and make
my nights worthy."

482
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:35,640
"You're the glow in me"

483
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:40,440
"that makes me shine like a star."

484
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:45,480
"All my silence means is"

485
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:50,440
"for us to unite once again."

486
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,720
"I'm lost and struggling
in an ocean of dreams."

487
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:29,320
"Come back to me and save me."

488
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:34,560
"There are millions of ways
I would like to express my love."

489
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:39,000
"Only if you could
understand my loneliness."

490
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:44,240
"We are one soul with two bodies."

491
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:48,880
"I realise that now."

492
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:54,120
"I know you are waiting for me."

493
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:58,040
"I promise that I will shower
all my love upon you."

494
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:02,760
"Come closer and let me feel
that soft hug of yours."

495
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:07,920
"Come closer and let me feel
that soft love of yours."

496
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:15,320
"Come closer and with all your
softness, make me feel alive."

497
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:22,480
"Let me feel
that soft kiss of yours."

498
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:27,440
"Let's put an end
to the shyness between us."

499
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:33,000
"Do you hear my heart"

500
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:38,320
"calling out your name?"

501
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:45,840
Okay.

502
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:47,840
Okay, hold it.

503
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,280
Hold it tight. Okay?

504
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:51,840
Call grandpa when the fish
takes the bait. - Okay.

505
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,640
So, is it only your doubt
or everyone else in the team

506
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:56,680
has the same doubt?

507
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:57,760
Only I doubt it.

508
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,760
Why didn't others
have the same doubt?

509
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:03,280
They think two ladies
cannot commit such a murder.

510
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:07,920
And again, the way they answered us
didn't give rise to any suspicion.

511
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:09,760
When did the murder take place?

512
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:14,200
On February 6th,
between 8 to 9 p.m.

513
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,960
Where were those two ladies
at that time? - They were at home.

514
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:21,840
And that makes me
suspect them even more.

515
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,160
So, benefit of doubt? Isn't it?

516
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:29,240
I understand
it's a gruesome murder.

517
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:33,160
Even I don't think they both
would have committed it.

518
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:35,480
They say that they moved places
to keep away

519
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:37,480
from him and did it
without his knowledge.

520
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:41,240
If they had committed that murder,
they wouldn't have said so.

521
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:42,440
Because

522
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:46,640
then there would be a strong
motive to commit the murder.

523
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:50,280
Didn't it cross your mind?
- Grandpa..

524
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,640
You got the catch!
Good..

525
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:10,160
Sir, I've discussed many cases with
you even after you got retired.

526
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:13,240
But this is the first time you want
to visit the crime scene. Why, sir?

527
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:15,880
You strongly doubt the woman
and her daughter.

528
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:18,240
But I don't feel
they would have done this.

529
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:21,160
So, I shall investigate
this case from my end.

530
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,240
Most welcome, sir.

531
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,080
And, sir.
The corpse was found here.

532
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,640
A local guy was crossing
this route around 8:30 p.m.

533
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:30,520
That's when he saw something was
on fire as per his statement.

534
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,120
The time quoted by him and that
of the autopsy are in sync.

535
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,720
So, the accused should have
committed the murder before 9 p.m.

536
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,240
and fled the place.

537
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,120
Since it rained
the previous night

538
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,040
we couldn't find any clues
in the ground.

539
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:46,440
I don't see any link between
the suspects and place of crime.

540
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,840
Do you think two women
could have committed this?

541
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,040
Indeed that is impossible

542
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:53,720
but someone could've helped them.

543
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,960
A man?
- Perhaps.

544
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:57,480
Didn't you tell me
that apart from them

545
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:59,120
there is no one in their family?

546
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:04,120
To lend such help,
one must be a brother

547
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,000
or a father.

548
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:07,800
Why can't it be a lover?

549
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:10,840
Not just that, the victim
was strangled to death.

550
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,480
Now, that can be
done by two women.

551
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:17,280
They could've executed it somewhere
else and later shifted it here.

552
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,440
Then they could've burnt it, right?

553
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:21,960
Still, they would need
someone's help to do that.

554
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:25,840
I look at this as a well planned
and executed murder.

555
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,080
No, sir.

556
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:29,800
I feel that the murderer
is an amateur.

557
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,080
How can you say that?

558
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:33,200
They have tried hard to hide
the identity of this corpse.

559
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,960
But the evidence
from the clothes

560
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,480
and the fingerprints are enough
to confirm the identity.

561
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:41,440
These are the few things the
criminal was totally unaware of.

562
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,280
Sir, it's a call
from that girl's office.

563
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:50,120
He has a point.

564
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:51,840
Sir..

565
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:54,360
That girl's friend, Latha,
is back from her home town.

566
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:55,920
We can go to meet her tomorrow.

567
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:30,720
Sir, Vamsi's mobile signal
was last found

568
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,080
at Vyasarpadi on February 6th
and then it went dead.

569
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:36,200
Also, that girl's call records
have been checked.

570
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:39,120
She doesn't seem to talk to anyone
regularly over the phone.

571
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:41,240
She met a guy
at the mall yesterday.

572
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:44,000
He was her friend's boyfriend.

573
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,920
How long has Ms. Dharini
been working here?

574
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,400
For the past two years, sir.

575
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:55,440
Excuse me.

576
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,440
Here she is.
Please take your seat

577
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:02,200
This is Latha, Dharini's team
lead and her close friend.

578
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,400
Hi, Latha. How are you?
- I'm good.

579
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:08,040
A few questions
and then you may leave.

580
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,400
No issues.
- Good.

581
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:12,600
Okay.

582
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:17,040
On February 6th, you had dropped
off Dharini after work.

583
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:19,040
Is it true?

584
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:21,040
Yes. Usually the workload
is more on Thursdays

585
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:23,000
and so we leave a little late.

586
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:24,640
I drop her regularly.

587
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:29,040
Does Dharini have any boyfriend?

588
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,080
Boyfriend..
No, she doesn't have any boyfriend.

589
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:34,440
She interacts and socialises
with office colleagues.

590
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:37,160
But again, she keeps a distance
from everyone.

591
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,360
Does she really
not have a boyfriend?

592
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:40,760
No.

593
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,840
How can you be so confident?

594
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:46,120
Any idea about this investigation?

595
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,280
She told me
that someone was murdered.

596
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:49,720
Someone Dharini knew.

597
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,240
His name is Vamsi.

598
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:55,080
Didn't Dharini tell you
anything about Vamsi?

599
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:57,320
She did, but recently.

600
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:00,280
Aren't you a very close
friend of Dharini's? - Yes.

601
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,480
And you say that she didn't tell
about Vamsi until recently.

602
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,800
Similarly, what if she is hiding
about her boyfriend?

603
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:08,320
I can empathise with her on why
she didn't tell me about Vamsi.

604
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:11,200
But if she has a boyfriend,
I'm sure I'd have known about him.

605
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:15,520
If she had a boyfriend,
Roopa and I would know it for sure.

606
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:17,520
Who is Roopa?

607
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:23,760
So, even you don't think
Dharini has a boyfriend?

608
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,480
No, sir. In fact, I keep
pulling her leg all the time.

609
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:29,400
She won't even react to it.

610
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:31,080
How do you pull her leg?

611
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,000
There is a guy living
across her house.

612
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:35,600
He steps out exactly at the
same time she leaves for office.

613
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:36,680
Every single day!

614
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:38,600
So, I keep pulling her
leg saying

615
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:40,400
that he is interested in her.

616
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:42,760
But she never paid
much heed to it.

617
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:48,280
Prabhakaran.

618
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:56,280
He works as a supervisor
at Casa Grande.

619
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:57,560
His work starts at 10 a.m.

620
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:01,160
Then why does he come out
when she leaves for work?

621
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:02,440
That too, every single day.

622
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:07,120
Definitely, there is some
link between them.

623
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,640
We didn't doubt it
because they are neighbours.

624
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:17,320
Just because both of them
step out at the same time

625
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,880
we cannot conclude that there
is something between them.

626
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,320
Even if they don't talk to each
other while stepping out

627
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,680
we can still find out if there
is something between them.

628
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:33,440
Sir, her office pick up is here.

629
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:39,960
There she is,
but what about him?

630
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:43,080
Hi.

631
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:48,280
The cab left but he isn't here yet.

632
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:49,840
Sir, there!

633
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:10,240
Sir, looks like he steps out
every day to jog.

634
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:34,200
Sir

635
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:36,200
regarding Prabhakaran's details
that you had asked for..

636
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:37,720
I was checking online.

637
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,720
You just won't believe this!

638
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:43,600
'Contract killer, Aali, caught!'

639
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,400
'Aali was the primary accused
in an MP's murder.'

640
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:49,200
'He was arrested
by Prabhakaran IPS.'

641
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:50,280
'All the higher officials'

642
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:51,440
'appreciated him
on achieving this feat.'

643
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:58,080
"With God by his side,
he is a one-man army!"

644
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:03,920
"He wields a weapon like a warrior
and fights courageously!"

645
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:09,640
"With God by his side,
he is a one-man army!"

646
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:15,360
"He wields a weapon like a warrior
and fights courageously!"

647
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,560
Hello.

648
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,240
Hello, sir
- Tell me, Karthikeyan.

649
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,840
You call only when
you need something.

650
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:53,200
Sir, how have you been?

651
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:54,440
I'm fine.

652
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,880
Come to the point.
No formalities.

653
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:59,880
Well, an IPS officer
named Prabhakaran..

654
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,400
I guess he was in service
two years ago.

655
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:05,400
I just need some
information about him.

656
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,600
Give me two minutes
and I will call you.

657
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:09,080
Thank you, sir.
Thank you so much.

658
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,600
Sir!
- Karthikeyan..

659
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:19,200
Officer Kola Venkat knows
Prabhakaran very well.

660
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:21,760
I'll send you his number.
Talk to him.

661
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:23,320
Okay, sir.
- Kola Venkat here.

662
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,600
Venkat, this is Karthikeyan
from Chennai.

663
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:27,680
How are you?
- Yes, I'm fine, sir.

664
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:31,520
Venkat, I would like to know
about Mr. Prabhakaran.

665
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,880
Mr. Prabhakaran isn't serving
the department anymore.

666
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:36,240
Fine, can you share
some details about him?

667
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:39,800
He is a mentor to everyone
in our department here.

668
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:45,400
Even today, we follow his footsteps
on how to handle murder cases.

669
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:47,280
All of a sudden, he resigned
from the force.

670
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:48,440
Truth be told

671
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:50,320
the department still misses him.

672
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:54,520
He is a mentor to everyone
in our department here.

673
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:56,120
Truth be told

674
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:58,120
the department still misses him.

675
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:20,280
"With God by his side,
he is a one-man army!"

676
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:26,080
"He wields a weapon like a warrior
and fights courageously!"

677
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:31,880
"With God by his side,
he is a one-man army!"

678
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:37,680
"He wields a weapon like a warrior
and fights courageously!"

679
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:53,160
"Eyes like an eagle
and paws like the tiger."

680
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:56,040
"Mess with him
and he will knock you down."

681
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:57,560
"Gangsters fear him
and even the outlaws"

682
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:59,080
"follow the rules when he is here."

683
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:02,120
"He has a 'Never give up'
attitude."

684
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:07,480
"His hunting adventures never stop
in the land of predators."

685
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:10,400
"He always fights
against injustice."

686
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:13,480
"He never rests
until justice is served."

687
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:18,440
"With God by his side,
he is a one-man army!"

688
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:24,200
"He wields a weapon like a warrior
and fights courageously!"

689
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:30,080
"With God by his side,
he is a one-man army!"

690
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:33,440
"He wields a weapon like a warrior"

691
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:35,840
"and fights courageously!"
- Prabhakaran!

692
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:37,000
Drop your weapon
and proceed upstairs!

693
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:38,760
Or else, I'll finish off your men!

694
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:07,800
Prabhakaran!

695
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:09,320
Now that you've
finished off my men

696
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:12,840
I will come back for revenge!
I'll make you regret!

697
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:20,640
There he is. - Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

698
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:23,640
Hi. How are you?

699
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:25,080
I'm fine.

700
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:27,760
Well..

701
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:30,360
I had visited you two
weeks ago, at your home.

702
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:32,000
I hope you remember.

703
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:34,400
Tell me.
What is the matter?

704
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:35,640
Nothing, just..

705
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:38,360
I came to know
that you were serving

706
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:40,320
the police force in Hyderabad
until two years ago.

707
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,160
So, I thought
you would help me out.

708
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:44,920
May I know how you came
to know about me?

709
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:47,280
I spoke to Kola Venkat.

710
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:50,560
How can I help you?

711
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:10,680
Dharini, open the door!

712
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:13,040
We suspect the woman
and her daughter.

713
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:16,040
But we are unable to move
the investigation any further.

714
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:18,560
Since you live
right across their house

715
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:20,480
and I have heard
that you have a strong

716
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:21,720
investigative mind

717
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:24,360
I thought you would share
some information.

718
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:28,240
What kind of information?
- Anything.

719
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:29,680
Anything at all.

720
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:31,840
Anything that you'd have
noticed by chance.

721
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:36,080
Nothing of that sort.

722
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:38,920
See, my point is

723
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:41,960
if the woman and her daughter
had committed the murder

724
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:43,880
they couldn't have done it
all by themselves.

725
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:46,680
Someone must have helped them.

726
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:51,560
If you had noticed someone
visiting them

727
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:53,080
or any description about them

728
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:54,200
please tell me.

729
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:57,000
If you doubt them so much

730
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:59,160
you could try third-degree
investigation, right?

731
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:01,400
Or why don't you try
the Truth Serum?

732
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:06,640
Third-degree..

733
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:14,240
Well..

734
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:17,480
I suggested that since
you asked for my help.

735
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:19,960
I don't know what else to say.

736
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:24,160
Excuse me.

737
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:52,520
"He is an all-rounder,
he is ferocious."

738
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:55,360
"He pounces like a preying beast."

739
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:56,960
"Obstacles don't bother him."

740
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:58,480
"Even if it is the whole
world against him"

741
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:01,280
"he keeps advancing
based on his instincts."

742
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:06,960
"You can't hide from him. He'll nab
you like an eagle nabs its prey."

743
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:12,920
"He is daring enough to call out
the lord of death for a face off."

744
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:17,760
"With God by his side,
he is a one-man army!"

745
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:23,560
"He wields a weapon like a warrior
and fights courageously!"

746
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:30,320
"With God by his side,
he is a one-man army!"

747
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:35,280
"He wields a weapon like a warrior
and fights courageously!"

748
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:41,120
"With God by his side,
he is a one-man army!"

749
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:46,960
"He wields a weapon like a warrior
and fights courageously!"

750
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:56,080
I was discussing this with Jagan.

751
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:57,560
I hope he must have told you.

752
01:00:57,960 --> 01:00:59,280
Regarding Prabhakaran, right?

753
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:02,480
We don't know if there
is any kind of contact

754
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:04,080
between that girl and Prabhakaran.

755
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:07,120
But he has followed her everywhere.

756
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:09,880
Sir, he is an ex-cop.

757
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:11,440
Quite intelligent.

758
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:13,320
He very well knows
how we'll perceive things

759
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,960
and what problems can come up.

760
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:21,400
Except for the fact that he
followed that girl everywhere

761
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:23,200
he hasn't established
any other kind of contact

762
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:24,400
between himself and that girl.

763
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:32,760
Sir, if Prabhakaran had
really helped them

764
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:34,680
then how could he make
such silly mistakes?

765
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:38,440
We got evidence from the clothes
and the corpse's fingerprints.

766
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:40,280
He couldn't have been so careless.

767
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:41,560
So

768
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:45,280
do you strongly believe
that it's Prabhakaran

769
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:47,000
who helped the woman
and her daughter?

770
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:49,480
Don't you feel so?

771
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:53,840
Well, if Dharini had any kind
of contact with Prabhakaran

772
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:56,480
then why would he follow her?

773
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:59,200
That piece doesn't seem
to fit in the puzzle.

774
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:03,560
Mr. Prabhakaran.

775
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:06,880
If you're looking for my help

776
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:08,200
then I'm sorry.

777
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:09,960
I'm not interested in helping
you in this matter.

778
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:11,880
Moreover, I don't know
anything else.

779
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:13,880
I'm not here for your help.

780
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:16,200
I know you don't
like helping others.

781
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:18,200
I came to tell you something.

782
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:22,760
The first murder case I handled
after joining the department..

783
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:24,880
I solved it in a jiffy.

784
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:27,920
It was the situation that made
the murderer commit the murder.

785
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:30,760
He had a beautiful wife

786
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:33,200
and a two-year-old child.
He had a happy family.

787
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:35,280
But

788
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:37,280
the guy who died
was not a good person.

789
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:38,440
He was a seasoned criminal.

790
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:42,680
After solving the case,
I was in a small dilemma.

791
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:46,400
That is, the murderer was
not a professional killer.

792
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:49,000
So, there is no chance
that he would repeat the same.

793
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:52,120
What would happen to his family
if I put him behind the bars?

794
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:54,720
Should I arrest him or forgive
and let him go free?

795
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:57,680
Fine, for a second I thought
I'd forgive him and let him go.

796
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:01,560
But within a week,
I realised something.

797
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:06,440
Everyone who commits such crimes
will have a justification for it.

798
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:11,160
And if officers like me think
of forgiving such criminals

799
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:13,920
then most of the murderers
will be roaming free.

800
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:18,320
So, I came to a conclusion.

801
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:24,600
I didn't want to re-write
the law and order.

802
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:27,280
It's already written.

803
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:32,840
According to the law,
murder is a serious crime.

804
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:34,640
I put him behind bars.

805
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:36,120
He is still in prison.

806
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:40,720
I hope you understand
why I am telling you this.

807
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:44,120
Do you have anything else to say?

808
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:46,160
I am done.

809
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:31,960
We are here to meet the inspector.
- Please wait.

810
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:34,320
Inform them once the inspector
is here. - Okay.

811
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:35,320
Sir, how may I help you?

812
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:36,960
Why do you get into such a mess
at this young age?

813
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:39,640
I have committed a murder.
I am turning myself in.

814
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:45,520
Sir, Prabhakaran has turned
himself in at R1 police station.

815
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:47,240
We haven't taken down his
confession statement yet.

816
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:49,240
The ADGP wants
you here immediately.

817
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:51,320
Sir, he doesn't look
like a killer.

818
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:04,720
Dharini is my girlfriend.

819
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:12,560
Dharini and I are lovers.

820
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:16,760
But except Dharini and myself,
no one else knows about it.

821
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:20,240
Because that's how Dharini
wanted to keep it.

822
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:23,200
We won't meet often.

823
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,400
We talk a lot over the phone.

824
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,240
I don't understand one thing.

825
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:31,800
I wonder why Dharini wanted
this relationship to be a secret.

826
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:35,200
The thing is..

827
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:37,560
Dharini doesn't trust
anyone so easily.

828
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:39,960
Even though, she said
that she loves me

829
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:42,120
only after she trusted
me completely

830
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:45,560
she told me about Vamsi.

831
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:51,240
Vamsi had made her
life a living hell.

832
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:53,640
The fear that she had for Vamsi..

833
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:56,160
Later, I got to know

834
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:58,240
how badly she was affected.

835
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:03,760
I am ready to do anything
for my beloved Dharini.

836
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:06,280
But..

837
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:09,440
I couldn't find a way
to get rid of her fear.

838
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:13,240
On February 6th,
Vamsi came looking for Dharini.

839
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:17,640
Do you know in which apartment
does Dharini stay?

840
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:19,160
I hadn't seen Vamsi before.

841
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:23,800
But it was quite easy for me
to recognise that he was Vamsi.

842
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:27,160
Dharini? It's been a while since
they moved to another place.

843
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:29,640
There is no need
for him to doubt me.

844
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:31,680
At the same time, he didn't
have to trust me either.

845
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:33,400
If he inquires someone else there

846
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:35,440
he'll find out that Dharini
still resides there.

847
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:37,280
In order to prevent
that from happening

848
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:38,800
I must make him trust me.

849
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:40,640
And make him leave
from there at once.

850
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:42,800
My mind started working faster.

851
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:44,200
How come you don't know
that she has moved?

852
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:46,040
So, if I start asking
him questions

853
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:48,040
then instead of doubting me

854
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:51,480
he will get into a defensive mode
to prevent me from doubting him.

855
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:54,240
He reacted exactly I expected him
to. - I know her from Hyderabad.

856
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:56,440
After she moved to Chennai

857
01:06:57,240 --> 01:06:58,600
this is the only addressed I had.

858
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:01,440
It's been long
since I spoke to her.

859
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:04,960
That interval was all I needed to
plan what I should tell him next.

860
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:08,160
They moved to Vyasarpadi.

861
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:10,960
I'll tell you the address.
Note it down.

862
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:12,880
It's quite far from here.

863
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:16,440
She'll be home by 7 p.m.
- Okay.

864
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:18,320
It'll take that long for her
to come back from work.

865
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:22,640
Take down my number. If you
can't find her house, call me.

866
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:25,680
Nice. - It was I who helped
them a lot while shifting.

867
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:27,480
Mention my name and she'll know.

868
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:29,160
For sure!
- Number?

869
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:32,840
My primary aim was to chase
Vamsi away from there.

870
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:36,160
But in order to get rid
of Dharini's fear of Vamsi

871
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:39,840
he must not exist at all.
This idea struck me a little late.

872
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:42,880
So, I chose a perfect place
to execute Vamsi

873
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:44,480
and gave him this address.

874
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:47,240
I was well prepared.

875
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:50,800
I reached before him
and was waiting for him.

876
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:02,040
Vamsi did exactly
what I expected him to do.

877
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:04,480
That is, instead of going straight
to the address that I gave him

878
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:05,800
he would observe
from a distance to confirm

879
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:08,360
if Dharini was really living there.

880
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:19,240
Disposing of the body
was difficult.

881
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:23,960
Instead, I thought disfiguring
his face would be the best way out.

882
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:33,200
I smashed his face
repeatedly with a rock.

883
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:35,320
I smashed it to the extent
that I lost the count.

884
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:37,080
But every time I smashed

885
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:39,720
I was relieved that Dharini
would live happily hereafter.

886
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:02,920
Everything was executed perfectly.

887
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:05,800
I returned home, thinking no one
will ever crack the case.

888
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:11,560
I didn't want Dharini
to find out about this.

889
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:15,480
But your suspicion..

890
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:18,040
It fell on Dharini and her mother.

891
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:21,200
I did this to save someone

892
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:24,200
but when she got trapped
in another problem

893
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:26,640
I felt that turning myself in
was the best option.

894
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:34,960
One coffee.

895
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:41,720
Sir, he has confessed
to the murder.

896
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:43,520
I had a doubt on him.

897
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:46,160
But I never expected them
to be in a relationship.

898
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:47,760
I am not sure, sir.

899
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:48,960
Karthikeyan

900
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:52,160
are you on your way to question
that woman and her daughter?

901
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:54,640
Yes, sir.
- Don't handle them roughly.

902
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:56,800
Go a little easy on them.

903
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:04,160
Jagan and Murali.
- Sir.

904
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:05,880
Go to Prabhakaran's house.
- Okay, sir.

905
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:07,840
Rest of you, come with me.
- Okay, sir.

906
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:11,960
What is the relationship
between you and Prabhakaran?

907
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:13,840
I don't understand.

908
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:15,400
Prabhakaran has turned himself in.

909
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:17,840
He said that he is in a
relationship with you.

910
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:22,200
He has confessed
that he murdered Vamsi for you.

911
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:23,840
Me!

912
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:26,560
Are we in a relationship?

913
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:29,400
I have hardly spoken
to him, sir.

914
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:32,960
I see him every day
when I leave for work.

915
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:34,840
We exchange a casual
smile and greetings.

916
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:36,960
Apart from that,
we haven't spoken at all.

917
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:38,800
Moreover

918
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:41,880
he claims to have called you often
from his landline phone.

919
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:44,720
We traced all his call logs.

920
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:47,760
And you have been receiving
regular calls from his number.

921
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:50,240
Those anonymous calls..

922
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:53,080
We had no idea who was
making those calls.

923
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:55,240
We keep receiving
calls regularly.

924
01:12:55,480 --> 01:12:58,360
If we attend it, there'll be no
response from the other end.

925
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:00,200
Once we hang up

926
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:01,920
we keep getting repeated calls.

927
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:06,320
At times, we just leave
the receiver away from the phone.

928
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:09,000
We have enough problems already.

929
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:12,160
I didn't want to make an issue
out of those anonymous calls.

930
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:15,680
We never told or discussed with
anyone about those calls.

931
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:17,160
Wait..

932
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:20,280
You claim to have no relationship
with Prabhakaran.

933
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:23,120
You never knew
who made those calls.

934
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:24,400
Then in that case

935
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:27,280
how did Prabhakaran come to know

936
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:29,080
about the issue
between you and Vamsi?

937
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:30,320
Well..

938
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:32,360
Even we have no idea about it.

939
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:34,800
Sir.

940
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:35,880
Just a minute.

941
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:41,560
Did she claim to have no
relationship with him?

942
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:42,800
Yes.

943
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:45,600
Did they say that they keep
getting anonymous calls?

944
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:47,640
Yes. How do you know this?

945
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:50,280
Sir, have a look at this.

946
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:01,960
What's that?

947
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:08,960
What's this?
- Sir.

948
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:12,640
I was listening to everything
that was going on over there.

949
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:14,520
Is it?
- Yes, sir.

950
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:17,200
Sir.

951
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:27,040
Sir, now I am in the hall
of that lady's house.

952
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:29,800
Now, from the hall

953
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:32,120
I am moving to their TV room.

954
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:34,560
Moving on from the TV room

955
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:36,400
to their bedroom.

956
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:38,560
Now

957
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:40,440
I'm in their bedroom, sir.

958
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:44,880
Now again, I'm moving
from the bedroom to the hall.

959
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:47,920
Moving into the kitchen.

960
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:54,800
Now I'm in the

961
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:56,640
kitchen, sir.

962
01:14:57,280 --> 01:14:58,200
Okay.

963
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:04,200
He must be a psychopath, sir.

964
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:10,400
When you told me that he claimed
they were lovers

965
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:14,160
I felt that there was no
possibility for it.

966
01:15:15,680 --> 01:15:17,400
Will that girl confirm the same?

967
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:19,440
That you both
are in a relationship.

968
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:24,000
What's there to confirm it?

969
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:25,960
Of course, we are lovers.

970
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:30,280
How long have you both
been in this relationship?

971
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:39,760
I'll like the place for sure,
but I hate surprises.

972
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:42,200
So, please tell me.
Where are we going?

973
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:52,560
I like you a lot.

974
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:54,800
I know you like me too.

975
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:59,080
But we never uttered a word
about it so far.

976
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:03,840
I cannot keep it from you anymore.

977
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:07,000
I would like to marry you.

978
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:12,360
She didn't give me a reply.

979
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:14,280
But it was after that

980
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:16,560
we both became very
close and attached.

981
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:20,480
It was only after she started
trusting me completely

982
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:22,400
she slowly told me everything
about Vamsi.

983
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:23,960
I kept worrying about her

984
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:26,880
all the time.

985
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:29,080
Even without telling her

986
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:32,040
she found out that I was
worried about her.

987
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:36,600
I guess she actually liked it.

988
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:39,560
Do you really know me that well?

989
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:46,320
I love you.

990
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:48,280
She isn't like any
other ordinary girl.

991
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,760
But she confessed her love for me.

992
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:54,880
So, imagine the love she
would've had for me.

993
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:57,120
Imagine the trust
she would've had on me.

994
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:00,000
In order to save her

995
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:02,160
not just one murder

996
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:04,440
I'm ready to commit
any number of murders.

997
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:08,280
Dharini's happiness
means a lot to me.

998
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:10,640
He is highly delusional.

999
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:13,760
All that he is saying is a part
of his imagination.

1000
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:16,920
I couldn't make him understand
that it's not the reality.

1001
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:19,320
Such patients behave quite normal.

1002
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:21,960
But his actions
are extremely dangerous.

1003
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:23,760
Like you just saw.

1004
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:25,480
I recommend immediate treatment.

1005
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:27,920
Still, he is very dangerous.

1006
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:30,840
Get the papers ready
and I will sign it.

1007
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:33,040
Excuse me.
- Yes, sir.

1008
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:40,800
His actions

1009
01:17:41,720 --> 01:17:44,000
and on contrast,
his deep silence..

1010
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:45,800
Very weird.

1011
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:49,320
Karthikeyan.

1012
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:51,520
Sir.
- I think the case is closed.

1013
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:06,560
Who is it?
- The EB guy, ma'am!

1014
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:43,960
The case isn't closed yet, sir.

1015
01:18:56,360 --> 01:18:57,320
Could it be him?

1016
01:18:58,400 --> 01:18:59,360
I don't know.

1017
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:02,680
But I escaped without his notice.

1018
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:19,080
Who is it?

1019
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:20,840
The EB guy, ma'am!

1020
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:37,280
Mom!

1021
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:41,720
You wretch!
How dare you!

1022
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:46,160
You thought you could
escape from me!

1023
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:50,960
If I cannot have you

1024
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:52,800
then no one must have you!

1025
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:00,240
Oh, no!

1026
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:01,960
Let go of her!

1027
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:03,880
Leave her!

1028
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:05,600
Oh, no!

1029
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:08,320
Let go of her!
I said, let go of her!

1030
01:20:11,680 --> 01:20:13,160
How dare you escape!

1031
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:18,200
Die!

1032
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:19,640
Die!

1033
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:22,600
Oh, no!

1034
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:26,240
You want to run away
from me, is it?

1035
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:43,840
How dare you!

1036
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:53,480
Dharini!

1037
01:20:57,280 --> 01:20:58,560
Let go of me!

1038
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,480
Leave me, Dharini!

1039
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:08,880
Leave me!

1040
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:09,960
Who is it?
- It's me, Prabhakaran.

1041
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:11,320
Your neighbour.

1042
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:12,480
Please open the door.

1043
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:28,080
What do you want?

1044
01:22:28,160 --> 01:22:29,400
I heard some noise.

1045
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:31,080
Any problem?

1046
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:32,960
N.. No..

1047
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:34,360
A rat.

1048
01:22:34,440 --> 01:22:35,960
My mom screamed out of fear
on seeing it.

1049
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:37,120
That's it.

1050
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:38,880
Have you killed?

1051
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:41,440
Did you kill the rat?

1052
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:44,160
No, it escaped.

1053
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:46,440
It's not a big deal.
Thank you.

1054
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:56,080
Fine, okay.

1055
01:23:09,160 --> 01:23:10,080
Hello.

1056
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:11,360
It's me, Prabhakaran.

1057
01:23:12,160 --> 01:23:13,200
I live across.

1058
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:14,920
Do you think both of you

1059
01:23:15,680 --> 01:23:17,600
can dispose of the corpse
all by yourselves?

1060
01:23:19,560 --> 01:23:20,600
Don't worry.

1061
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:22,000
No problem.

1062
01:23:22,440 --> 01:23:23,960
I'll hang up and talk
to you in person.

1063
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:33,360
Do you hear everything
that goes on here?

1064
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:37,080
I heard a heavy noise.

1065
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:39,280
So, I came and knocked
on your door.

1066
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:40,600
When you opened the door

1067
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:42,480
the chain on the door was cut

1068
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:44,360
and you looked very scared.

1069
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:46,760
When I peeped in

1070
01:23:47,240 --> 01:23:48,480
I saw two feet.

1071
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:51,320
If someone was hiding in here

1072
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:53,440
there was no need
for him to lie down here.

1073
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:56,040
Based on what I saw and heard

1074
01:23:56,480 --> 01:23:58,160
I predicted that this
would've happened.

1075
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:00,680
My prediction was correct.

1076
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:03,280
What are you going to do next?

1077
01:24:03,720 --> 01:24:05,120
I'll turn myself in.

1078
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:08,400
I killed him. I'll turn myself in.
- Mom, what are you saying?

1079
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:10,480
You're innocent.
- Dharini, shut up!

1080
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:13,680
I committed this murder
to save my daughter.

1081
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:15,280
I shall turn in.

1082
01:24:17,240 --> 01:24:18,960
One person couldn't
have done it all alone.

1083
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:21,560
The police won't believe if you say
that you did it all by yourself.

1084
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:23,880
They will arrest her too.
- Oh, no!

1085
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:26,960
My daughter's life
must not get affected. I..

1086
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:28,600
What should I do?

1087
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:30,560
It's your wish to turn yourself in.

1088
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:33,400
But if you want to escape

1089
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:35,600
then this corpse
must be disposed of.

1090
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:38,480
You cannot do it yourselves.

1091
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:40,640
You need help.

1092
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:46,160
I shall help you.

1093
01:24:55,480 --> 01:24:56,360
But

1094
01:24:56,880 --> 01:24:57,880
I need to know

1095
01:24:58,520 --> 01:24:59,920
who he is,
what the problem

1096
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:03,880
between you two is
and why he came here.

1097
01:25:05,240 --> 01:25:06,640
Do as I ask you to.

1098
01:25:07,720 --> 01:25:10,120
You believe this is
what happened, right?

1099
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:11,640
No, sir.

1100
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:14,560
This is what exactly happened.
- No, Karthikeyan.

1101
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:16,560
That's your assumption.

1102
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:20,280
You don't have evidence
to back up your theory.

1103
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:23,400
But I have the evidence
to prove it otherwise.

1104
01:25:24,120 --> 01:25:25,200
What evidence do you have?

1105
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:26,680
According to the autopsy report

1106
01:25:27,240 --> 01:25:29,960
the murder took place
between 8 and 9 p.m.

1107
01:25:31,160 --> 01:25:32,320
Nothing is wrong there.

1108
01:25:33,400 --> 01:25:35,520
Do you agree that the
doctor's certificate is correct?

1109
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:37,120
Sir.

1110
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:40,000
Then whatever you said

1111
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:44,800
must have taken place in her house
between 8 and 9 p.m. Isn't it?

1112
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:46,560
Yes, sir.

1113
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:49,960
It must take an hour to reach
Vyasarpadi road from her house.

1114
01:25:50,840 --> 01:25:53,280
That time can increase
during peak hours.

1115
01:25:54,120 --> 01:25:57,280
I found out where they were
when the murder took place.

1116
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:00,760
The girl has called for drinking
water can at 7:30 p.m.

1117
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:04,320
Upon tracing the call
using the mobile tower

1118
01:26:04,680 --> 01:26:06,720
it was near Anj Vilaku,
at Mambalam.

1119
01:26:07,240 --> 01:26:09,840
The guy who answered
was in the same area too.

1120
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:13,120
When that guy came to their house
to deliver the water can

1121
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:14,440
the time was 8:20 p.m.

1122
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:16,920
That guy's statement
is another proof

1123
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:18,600
that the woman and her
daughter were at home.

1124
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:22,680
If the incident had happened
after the guy left

1125
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:26,360
then they must have gone
to Vyasarpadi after killing him.

1126
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:28,920
A guy who crossed
that spot around 9 p.m.

1127
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:31,600
saw something was
burning on the road

1128
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:32,840
and you are the one
who told me this.

1129
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:34,200
In that case

1130
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:36,280
do you think it is possible
to kill Vamsi

1131
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:38,520
and burn him at that spot
within 30 minutes?

1132
01:26:40,120 --> 01:26:41,200
Impossible.

1133
01:26:42,760 --> 01:26:45,080
The woman and her daughter
are not murderers.

1134
01:26:45,240 --> 01:26:46,280
It's indeed Prabhakaran.

1135
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:48,320
You are not agreeing to this.

1136
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:50,800
How could they have done it

1137
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:52,400
with so many evidence
pointing towards him?

1138
01:26:54,520 --> 01:26:55,440
Answer me.

1139
01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:04,280
According to the
autopsy report

1140
01:27:04,360 --> 01:27:06,040
the murder took place
in between 8 and 9 p.m.

1141
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:08,800
When that guy came to their house
to deliver the water can

1142
01:27:08,920 --> 01:27:09,960
the time was 8:20 p.m.

1143
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:11,640
That guy's statement
is another proof that

1144
01:27:11,720 --> 01:27:13,040
the woman and her
daughter were at home.

1145
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:14,440
Do you think it is possible
to kill Vamsi

1146
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:16,480
and burn him at that spot
within 30 minutes?

1147
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:18,800
The woman and her daughter
are not murderers.

1148
01:27:18,920 --> 01:27:19,920
It's indeed Prabhakaran.

1149
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:23,920
"He is a murderer."

1150
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:32,440
"He is a murderer."

1151
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:34,800
Mr. Prabhakaran didn't come
to work on February 5th and 6th.

1152
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,160
Thank you.
- It's okay.

1153
01:27:36,280 --> 01:27:42,200
"A murderer!"

1154
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:47,720
I'm ready to commit
any number of murders.

1155
01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:51,200
Dharini's happiness
means a lot to me.

1156
01:28:13,480 --> 01:28:16,200
Did he want us to identify
Vamsi's corpse?

1157
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:17,640
How does he benefit from it?

1158
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:18,800
I don't know, sir.

1159
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:23,400
But one thing, sir. If he really
didn't want us to crack the case

1160
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:25,720
he wouldn't have been
so careless to leave

1161
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,080
the fingerprints
and the clothes as clues.

1162
01:28:50,280 --> 01:28:52,960
Only flowers?
Don't you want sweets?

1163
01:28:53,480 --> 01:28:54,680
I will buy everything, dear.

1164
01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:57,120
Don't you sleep off
after having food. Wait for me.

1165
01:28:57,880 --> 01:28:59,920
I thought it was my phone,
but it's yours.

1166
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:02,160
So, whom were you talking
to all this while?

1167
01:29:02,240 --> 01:29:03,760
Of course,
I was talking to your wife.

1168
01:29:11,480 --> 01:29:12,360
Jagan!
- Sir.

1169
01:29:12,520 --> 01:29:15,600
I need all the newspapers from
February 6th to 20th. - Yes, sir.

1170
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:30,040
Kola Venkat, I want
Prabhakaran's family details.

1171
01:30:15,080 --> 01:30:16,960
Sir, the case is closed.

1172
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:20,560
Do you believe at least now

1173
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:22,440
that Prabhakaran is the murderer?

1174
01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:25,480
Everyone said
that you are the murderer.

1175
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:30,120
Only I believed that you didn't
murder or were delusional.

1176
01:30:30,840 --> 01:30:33,120
I said that you were making
a fool out of everyone.

1177
01:30:37,480 --> 01:30:38,600
But in the end

1178
01:30:39,040 --> 01:30:41,040
you made me look
like a bigger fool.

1179
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:44,320
Because you did the murder.

1180
01:30:44,360 --> 01:30:46,600
That's what we had been saying
since the beginning.

1181
01:30:46,680 --> 01:30:47,800
That he is the murderer.

1182
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:51,240
Just because Prabhakaran
committed a murder

1183
01:30:51,560 --> 01:30:54,600
doesn't mean that the woman and
daughter didn't commit any murder.

1184
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:56,640
Even they have
committed a murder.

1185
01:30:58,480 --> 01:30:59,440
I don't get it.

1186
01:31:00,040 --> 01:31:03,640
I checked all the case records
when you were in the department.

1187
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:07,160
Out of 45 cases,
34 were unsolved.

1188
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:09,200
You earned a name
as an able officer.

1189
01:31:09,560 --> 01:31:13,320
Yet, how come you have such a poor
track record? I inquired Kola.

1190
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:15,640
So many unsolved cases. How?

1191
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:17,080
It's unsolved
only as per the records.

1192
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:18,960
You don't know
about Mr. Prabhakaran.

1193
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:21,120
He doesn't follow
the law and order.

1194
01:31:21,680 --> 01:31:22,800
He has his own laws.

1195
01:31:22,920 --> 01:31:25,760
He won't arrest a criminal
immediately after he finds him.

1196
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:28,120
He'll first find out why
that person committed the crime.

1197
01:31:28,200 --> 01:31:30,600
If he feels there is justice in it,
he'll warn and let him go.

1198
01:31:30,680 --> 01:31:32,480
But he'll always have
an eye on that criminal.

1199
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:34,200
He doesn't care
about the track record.

1200
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:37,160
If a chance is all
one needs to reform

1201
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:38,320
he will give him that chance.

1202
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:40,520
The Prabhakaran
that Kola Venkat defined

1203
01:31:40,640 --> 01:31:41,600
and the Prabhakaran who
asked me to investigate

1204
01:31:41,680 --> 01:31:43,600
the woman and her daughter
using the third-degree

1205
01:31:43,960 --> 01:31:45,080
had a vast difference.

1206
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:47,640
That's when I made up my mind

1207
01:31:48,120 --> 01:31:50,120
that you are involved
in this murder.

1208
01:31:50,720 --> 01:31:52,720
But I didn't know
how and to what extent.

1209
01:31:53,560 --> 01:31:54,880
The moment you turned yourself in

1210
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:57,520
and confessed
to committing this murder

1211
01:31:58,360 --> 01:31:59,640
that's when I confirmed it.

1212
01:32:00,720 --> 01:32:02,240
That it was that woman
and her daughter

1213
01:32:02,360 --> 01:32:04,040
who committed this murder
and not you.

1214
01:32:04,280 --> 01:32:06,840
But his confession statement

1215
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:08,920
and the modus operandi
of the murder are in sync.

1216
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:09,880
No, sir.

1217
01:32:09,960 --> 01:32:12,800
If Dharini had told
Prabhakaran about Vamsi

1218
01:32:13,240 --> 01:32:14,600
and asked for his help

1219
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:17,600
he wouldn't have suggested
murder as an option.

1220
01:32:18,440 --> 01:32:20,480
Then how did the murder
take place?

1221
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:21,840
This is how..

1222
01:32:22,040 --> 01:32:24,520
The murder took place before
Prabhakaran got involved in it.

1223
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:27,400
So, they didn't have any
other option but to hide it.

1224
01:32:27,480 --> 01:32:30,360
Karthikeyan, first you said
Prabhakaran committed the murder.

1225
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:32,360
Now, you say it's the woman
and daughter.

1226
01:32:32,760 --> 01:32:33,840
What are you blabbering?

1227
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:35,920
They both have done it, sir.

1228
01:32:36,200 --> 01:32:38,920
But Vamsi was murdered
by that woman and her daughter.

1229
01:32:40,040 --> 01:32:41,520
You are confusing me!

1230
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:43,120
You've lost!

1231
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:44,760
Why don't you accept it?

1232
01:32:45,240 --> 01:32:47,400
Moreover, on February 6th,
the day of the murder

1233
01:32:47,480 --> 01:32:49,960
that woman and daughter were
at home between 8 and 9 p.m.

1234
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:52,640
Nothing happened there
and there is strong evidence.

1235
01:32:52,720 --> 01:32:53,680
Explain that!

1236
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:55,320
I'll tell you.

1237
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:58,920
The murder wasn't committed
on Feb 6th.

1238
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:02,640
It was on Feb 4th.
- What?

1239
01:33:03,320 --> 01:33:05,480
You had planned it brilliantly.

1240
01:33:06,200 --> 01:33:07,800
The evidence from the murder site

1241
01:33:07,880 --> 01:33:09,400
that is the fingerprints
and the tailor label..

1242
01:33:09,680 --> 01:33:12,480
All these days, I believed it was
a mistake from the murderer's end.

1243
01:33:13,200 --> 01:33:14,720
But recently, I found out

1244
01:33:15,080 --> 01:33:17,400
that they were left there
as a part of the plan.

1245
01:33:20,360 --> 01:33:24,480
On February 4th, the woman
and her daughter murdered Vamsi.

1246
01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:30,720
On Feb 6th, you had committed
another murder.

1247
01:33:54,280 --> 01:33:55,440
And that's the corpse.

1248
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,080
We all believed
that it was Vamsi's corpse

1249
01:33:58,200 --> 01:33:59,920
based on the evidence
you left behind.

1250
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:06,480
What about Vamsi's corpse?

1251
01:34:06,640 --> 01:34:08,240
What did you do
with Vamsi's body?

1252
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:12,000
You disposed it
in the outskirts of the city.

1253
01:34:12,320 --> 01:34:14,120
That comes under
a different jurisdiction.

1254
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:17,320
Hence, it was not
linked up to this case.

1255
01:34:17,680 --> 01:34:20,960
Apart from that,
no one noticed it as it came

1256
01:34:21,240 --> 01:34:24,640
as a very small article
in the newspapers.

1257
01:34:24,720 --> 01:34:27,640
If Vamsi's corpse could have
been easily disposed

1258
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:28,880
why commit another murder?

1259
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:30,400
To trick the police!

1260
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:32,600
Vamsi is a minister's brother.

1261
01:34:33,240 --> 01:34:35,240
The minister won't rest when he
finds out his brother is missing.

1262
01:34:35,320 --> 01:34:36,680
He'll search until he finds him.

1263
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:38,360
So, the case will never close.

1264
01:34:38,440 --> 01:34:41,080
And at some breaking point
during the investigation

1265
01:34:41,160 --> 01:34:43,840
that woman and her daughter
would have confessed

1266
01:34:44,040 --> 01:34:45,240
Vamsi's visit and the incident.

1267
01:34:46,360 --> 01:34:49,360
So, Prabhakaran wanted to save
the woman and her daughter

1268
01:34:49,680 --> 01:34:51,040
and close this case.

1269
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:53,840
Hence, the second murder.

1270
01:34:54,960 --> 01:34:57,280
And that is the intelligence
of Prabhakaran.

1271
01:34:58,720 --> 01:35:00,680
So, did he do all this

1272
01:35:01,320 --> 01:35:03,360
just for the love
he had for that girl?

1273
01:35:04,600 --> 01:35:06,000
That too, for a one-sided love?

1274
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:09,880
You have no relationship
with that girl.

1275
01:35:10,200 --> 01:35:12,760
Then why did you take
such a big risk for her?

1276
01:35:13,720 --> 01:35:15,440
You have committed
another murder for her.

1277
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:17,160
Whom did you murder?

1278
01:35:17,880 --> 01:35:20,720
Only you have the answers
to these two questions.

1279
01:35:23,240 --> 01:35:25,880
But you aren't going to agree
to anything I just said.

1280
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:28,600
As far as I'm concerned

1281
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:31,560
I don't see any light in this case.

1282
01:35:32,040 --> 01:35:33,120
It's a dead end.

1283
01:35:38,160 --> 01:35:40,960
Didn't he react at all
for whatever you said?

1284
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,320
Sir, he didn't expect that I'd
come this far in the case.

1285
01:35:45,160 --> 01:35:48,640
If I had cracked it,
I think he knows what to do.

1286
01:35:49,440 --> 01:35:51,360
There is no use proceeding further.

1287
01:35:51,680 --> 01:35:52,560
Case closed.

1288
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:57,240
Sir!
- Yes!

1289
01:36:04,480 --> 01:36:06,480
You have no relationship
with that girl.

1290
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:09,480
Then why did you take
such a big risk for her?

1291
01:36:10,520 --> 01:36:12,320
Why must you turn yourself in
for my sake?

1292
01:36:14,160 --> 01:36:15,960
You have committed
another murder for her.

1293
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:17,560
Whom did you murder?

1294
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:20,480
You have no relationship
with that girl.

1295
01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:22,960
You have committed
another murder for her.

1296
01:36:28,200 --> 01:36:30,080
Why must you turn yourself in
for my sake?

1297
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:31,760
I won't agree with it.

1298
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:43,560
I need to have a word with you.

1299
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:47,360
I am going to turn myself in.

1300
01:36:50,080 --> 01:36:50,960
But..

1301
01:36:52,280 --> 01:36:54,360
Didn't you say
that no problems would arise

1302
01:36:54,520 --> 01:36:57,040
and it would be easy
to get out of this?

1303
01:36:58,040 --> 01:36:59,000
No.

1304
01:36:59,640 --> 01:37:01,240
Everything is happening
as per the plan.

1305
01:37:02,840 --> 01:37:05,080
If you have to turn yourself
in to save us

1306
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:06,760
then I won't allow it to happen.

1307
01:37:07,480 --> 01:37:08,600
We will turn ourselves in.

1308
01:37:09,240 --> 01:37:10,200
Dharini.

1309
01:37:15,800 --> 01:37:16,720
Listen to me.

1310
01:37:17,640 --> 01:37:20,160
I'm not turning myself in
for the murder you guys committed.

1311
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:22,160
I have also committed a murder.

1312
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:27,400
Do you remember the time
I saw you first?

1313
01:37:34,960 --> 01:37:37,680
Sorry. We just moved
into the opposite flat.

1314
01:37:37,960 --> 01:37:39,600
We have two huge luggage.

1315
01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:42,400
My daughterand I
aren't able to lift it.

1316
01:37:42,600 --> 01:37:43,920
Can you please help us?

1317
01:37:44,640 --> 01:37:45,880
Sure. Come on.

1318
01:37:52,240 --> 01:37:53,800
That was the first time I saw you.

1319
01:37:55,960 --> 01:37:58,520
But I have seen someone
who looks exactly like you.

1320
01:37:58,840 --> 01:37:59,880
I knew her.

1321
01:38:00,240 --> 01:38:01,920
We lived a life together.

1322
01:38:02,600 --> 01:38:04,000
Will you marry me?

1323
01:38:05,800 --> 01:38:07,520
I promise I'll take care of you.

1324
01:38:08,280 --> 01:38:10,760
Yes.
- Really?

1325
01:38:15,880 --> 01:38:16,840
I love you, Aaradhana.

1326
01:38:18,200 --> 01:38:19,280
I love you too.

1327
01:38:49,120 --> 01:38:52,040
'Aali, head of a famous gang'

1328
01:38:52,160 --> 01:38:54,960
'had murdered the ruling party MLA,
B L Reddy and got arrested.'

1329
01:38:55,120 --> 01:38:58,280
'Reports say that he escaped
from the prison last night.'

1330
01:38:58,360 --> 01:39:02,880
'Four officers, who were on duty
have been suspended.'

1331
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:04,360
'Prabhakaran IPS'

1332
01:39:04,440 --> 01:39:07,080
'was the main officer who led
the mission while nabbing Aali.'

1333
01:39:07,160 --> 01:39:10,080
'Police sources say
that Aali had escaped'

1334
01:39:10,160 --> 01:39:13,880
'from prison with the intention
to take revenge.'

1335
01:39:14,120 --> 01:39:18,600
'Hence, the security has been
tightened at Prabhakaran's house.'

1336
01:39:18,760 --> 01:39:22,680
'Aali is a prime accused
in many murder cases.'

1337
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:28,960
Why are you thinking too much?

1338
01:39:29,800 --> 01:39:32,880
Do you think that he'll end up
harming me to take revenge on you?

1339
01:39:36,600 --> 01:39:39,360
Nothing will happen to me
until you are with me.

1340
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:46,080
"You are the soul that is filled
in me in the form of love."

1341
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:47,240
Really?

1342
01:39:48,920 --> 01:39:53,520
I trust you more than
you trust yourself.

1343
01:39:53,920 --> 01:39:54,800
Got it?

1344
01:40:01,280 --> 01:40:02,160
Hey!

1345
01:40:06,840 --> 01:40:07,840
What's your problem?

1346
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:09,640
All the doors are locked.

1347
01:40:10,600 --> 01:40:12,600
Don't you get scared
and scare me in turn.

1348
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:17,840
If you are so concerned, you
could've reached home soon, right?

1349
01:40:17,960 --> 01:40:21,520
I am Prabhakaran's wife.
Who'd have the guts to attack me?

1350
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:45,760
Aaradhana?

1351
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:47,360
Aaradhana?

1352
01:40:47,640 --> 01:40:48,880
Aaradhana!

1353
01:40:49,560 --> 01:40:55,600
"You are the soul that is filled
in me in the form of love."

1354
01:41:01,040 --> 01:41:07,000
"You now live in my memories
and in the form of pain."

1355
01:41:10,280 --> 01:41:12,080
Every day, when you
leave for work

1356
01:41:12,760 --> 01:41:14,680
I also step out for this reason.

1357
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:20,160
You look exactly like her
and every time I look at you

1358
01:41:20,680 --> 01:41:22,160
I feel like I'm looking at her.

1359
01:41:25,880 --> 01:41:28,640
I was on the hunt to avenge
her death by killing her murderer.

1360
01:41:28,720 --> 01:41:31,200
Tell me, where is he?
- If I say that, he'll kill me.

1361
01:41:31,280 --> 01:41:34,480
If you don't say, I'll kill you!
Now, speak up!

1362
01:41:49,280 --> 01:41:52,000
Tell me! Where is Aali?
Speak up! Where is Aali?

1363
01:41:52,080 --> 01:41:53,520
Aali.. Aali is in Chennai!

1364
01:42:03,720 --> 01:42:05,040
I took my revenge on him.

1365
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:07,800
I used that murder to save you.

1366
01:42:09,520 --> 01:42:10,800
The murder you committed

1367
01:42:11,360 --> 01:42:12,720
was an act of self-defence.

1368
01:42:14,520 --> 01:42:15,640
What I did

1369
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:18,080
was the vengeance
to take revenge.

1370
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:25,760
There is nothing wrong
with me turning myself in.

1371
01:42:29,880 --> 01:42:32,560
I would've turned myself in
without telling you all this.

1372
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:33,920
But

1373
01:42:34,160 --> 01:42:37,560
I don't want you to live
a life filled with guilt.

1374
01:42:38,440 --> 01:42:39,920
That is why I'm telling you this.

1375
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:43,960
You must do me a huge favour.

1376
01:42:46,200 --> 01:42:48,080
When the police come
and question you

1377
01:42:49,080 --> 01:42:50,920
tell them what I tell you.

1378
01:42:51,280 --> 01:42:53,280
I have accordingly
set up a few evidence.

1379
01:42:56,640 --> 01:42:58,440
I couldn't save
my beloved Aaradhana.

1380
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:02,360
Turning myself in for you

1381
01:43:04,320 --> 01:43:05,680
is something I choose to do.

1382
01:43:07,200 --> 01:43:08,400
I need this.

1383
01:43:09,520 --> 01:43:10,400
Please.

1384
01:43:38,680 --> 01:43:40,840
You have no relationship
with that girl.

1385
01:43:41,080 --> 01:43:43,840
Then why did you take
such a big risk for her?

1386
01:43:45,120 --> 01:43:46,960
You committed
another murder for her.

1387
01:43:47,440 --> 01:43:48,720
Whom did you murder?

1388
01:43:49,320 --> 01:43:52,200
Prabhakaran, if I can
find out so much

1389
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:55,640
do you think I wouldn't have found
the answers to these questions too?

1390
01:43:56,200 --> 01:43:58,800
The sacrifice that you
have made for that woman

1391
01:43:59,160 --> 01:44:00,520
and her daughter is a great deed.

1392
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,240
It shows that you are not
just a good police officer

1393
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:05,040
but also a good human being.

1394
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:07,040
I respect that.

1395
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:11,400
As far as the department
is concerned, let my findings

1396
01:44:11,800 --> 01:44:13,720
remain a mystery.

1397
01:44:14,280 --> 01:44:16,560
I won this battle
as a police officer.

1398
01:44:16,920 --> 01:44:19,200
But in the name of humanity

1399
01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:21,040
you have won!

1400
01:44:22,360 --> 01:44:23,600
Salute!

1401
01:45:12,040 --> 01:45:17,000
"He is a murderer."

1402
01:45:19,560 --> 01:45:25,160
"He is a murderer."

1403
01:45:28,560 --> 01:45:34,640
"A murderer!"

1404
01:47:11,040 --> 01:47:14,200
"A murderer."
