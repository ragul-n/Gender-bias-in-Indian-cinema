1
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:19,541
Look here my son,
look here my dear you are everything for me

2
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:24,791
Hey my darling, how will I be without you?

3
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:33,916
Look here my son,
look here my dear you are everything for me

4
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:39,166
Hey my darling, how will I be without you?

5
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:45,250
Shall I become the hand to
console when you are frightened?

6
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:50,125
Shall I become the pillow
to rest when you are dreaming?

7
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:55,000
Shall I sing lullaby to console and
become milk to bring you up?

8
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:12,072
Look here my son,
look here my dear you are everything for me

9
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:17,916
Hey my darling, how will I be without you?

10
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:43,208
You as the happiness came out from my womb

11
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:46,958
You will always be my smile dear

12
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:52,750
The sky, Sun and the beautiful moonlight

13
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:57,208
They are never a comparison to your glow

14
00:05:57,458 --> 00:06:06,000
Your tender face is glowing with a royal charisma

15
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:14,875
You came as a boon of all the
Gods to bless this mother

16
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:20,500
To make me happy with kisses all the day

17
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:52,250
My world completely turned like you
Whatever you do is priceless

18
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:57,583
No sorrow can directly come to me

19
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:01,875
Your face is the light in the heart

20
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:11,291
Your calling as mom is enough and is divine for me

21
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:16,708
Great happiness seeing you grow up

22
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,875
Shall I throw aside the bad sight?

23
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:25,083
Shall I forever guard you as an eyelid?

24
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:31,291
Great happiness seeing you grow up

25
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:34,250
Shall I throw aside the bad sight?

26
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:40,208
Shall I forever guard you as an eyelid?

27
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:45,041
Our life has changed as a festival because of you

28
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:49,958
Fullness has come as a celebration
and all this is because of you

29
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:54,916
Our time stood still in your company

30
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:20,916
Will we reach in three hours?

31
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:24,458
In the present speed,
it may take another three days

32
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:28,291
Did I say not to go fast?
I just said not to take the car into the ditches?

33
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:32,416
Still going so far, you should have
booked tickets in a flight or train.

34
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:34,458
Why do you take the strain of driving all the way?

35
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:37,666
Driving is not any fun to me.

36
00:08:38,332 --> 00:08:42,375
Your pampered son has booked me asking for car

37
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:46,291
No idea when ths fellow would lose his craze for cars

38
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:50,458
Come on stop now.
My son would always roam in a good car.

39
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:56,500
He would drive so fast that you
would fear sitting in the back seat

40
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:59,458
You would never praise me right?

41
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,333
I will tell you two things

42
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:08,166
First, wife should never praise husband
and that too never before him

43
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,666
But still I feel like appreciating a sincere person like you

44
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:16,040
But, I cannot let go of my ethics right?

45
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:22,790
Your ethics are like saying Cuckoo
should not song and a lady should not talk

46
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:26,665
You gifted me the family life which
I never had from childhood

47
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:32,125
And all the mischief I missed playing with my mom,

48
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:38,068
he is giving me all that happiness
playing all that mischief with me

49
00:09:40,068 --> 00:09:41,857
Soon we would grow old right?

50
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:47,125
Then he too would become a great
business man and go leaving me

51
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:51,583
So, I will not send him into your profession
and send him to some other profession

52
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:57,208
Whatever profession he takes up, would be successful

53
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:58,458
What do you say Vara?

54
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:00,375
Vara, say yes
Ok mummy

55
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:01,666
What do you say, ok?

56
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:04,583
Hi...
Hi.

57
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:07,415
Nice car
Yes, just like you

58
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:08,875
Thank you

59
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:09,708
Welcome

60
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:18,665
Who is this?

61
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,875
What is this?

62
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:22,541
Car... Owner...

63
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:24,875
Is he driver then?

64
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,458
Sir... Midnight... Girl... Lift... Dropping...

65
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:30,583
Please... Please

66
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:31,625
Stop the car...

67
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:35,208
I thought I got a good deal...

68
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:37,791
Damn

69
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:41,375
What is with these girls?

70
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:46,333
Maybe this is called enjoying property of others...

71
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:50,583
Sorry sir, I too thought of buying a similar
car and thus had a trial

72
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:54,500
Yes, you take a trial and
if the owner an idiot you would fool him

73
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:56,625
However your duty is good.

74
00:11:56,958 --> 00:12:00,833
You take the car saying valet parking
and roam around the city

75
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,083
Sir, bar is in Banjara hills and parking is in Jubilee hills.

76
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:05,125
What can we do sir?

77
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:10,958
True dude, buying a car these days became easy
and getting parking place has got tougher.

78
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:14,000
You are right, right, right...

79
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:16,750
Ok sir, take a right sir?

80
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:18,041
Straight
Ok sir

81
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:30,458
Greetings sir

82
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:32,333
Thank you

83
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:33,250
It is ok sir

84
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:35,208
Hey, come on...

85
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,208
Sir, what is hundred for your range?
Give me five hundred sir

86
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:46,708
Are you asking for a tip or for a debt?

87
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,083
Sir, is five hundred a debt?

88
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:51,458
Whatever, you are a knacky fellow
Thank you sir

89
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,875
Sir, why do you put back what you took out

90
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:56,458
Thank you sir, good night sir...

91
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:57,958
Hey auto...
Good night

92
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:00,041
Good night

93
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:06,166
Hey...Dropping for 888 Swift car

94
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:11,208
No dude, Audi and Benz... Only rich cars...

95
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:12,000
Ok?

96
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,375
Is it...!

97
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:21,665
Look father, I gave all the money I got as offerings
from devotees at the temple to this fellow for interest

98
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:24,790
Interest and principal both are missing..
to hell with this guy

99
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:26,583
Still, what are you here for father?

100
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:29,750
He had once come to our Church.

101
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:32,833
I asked him what his problems were

102
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:40,750
He said I would go weak listening to his troubles
and instead get interest lending him money

103
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:45,875
I came to know after giving that
nothing would come back if given to him

104
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,708
Come on look there, father...

105
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:50,291
For lending money to that Vara,

106
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:54,250
he is doing Namaz on the roads instead of mosque

107
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:56,083
Do not worry...

108
00:13:56,375 --> 00:14:03,208
That Lord would soon send a savior to get back
all the money given driving away all our troubles...

109
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:06,790
Who is there to collect the debts from him father?

110
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:07,708
I am here

111
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:18,708
Hey bro, it is not so easy to collect money from him.

112
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:23,750
I see all of you are into depression

113
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:26,125
and are unable to ask back
your money strongly from him

114
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:31,041
You need a leader in such a situation
and I should be that.

115
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:33,250
Why only you bro, I am here

116
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:40,083
If discussion with him grows into a fight,
courage to face all that is only in me

117
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,708
Say now, who should become the leader?

118
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,208
Brother, there is a huge crowd upstairs.

119
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:47,878
Be careful...

120
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,208
All together have chosen a leader too
Leader?

121
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:06,875
Hey bro, how long would you stare at each other?

122
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:08,665
Talk something and settle it soon

123
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,208
I do not get a mood unless I stare

124
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:17,125
Do you remember,
you gave this in our office about six months back?

125
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,041
Your bank has given only half of
what was promised to be given

126
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:23,833
It should give the other half, do you remember that?

127
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:27,375
Yes, I remember
and came here to collect that other half

128
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:30,583
Hey bro, we made you sit there to ask
for money of all of us

129
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:34,416
Hey, leader first and then the public.

130
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,958
You took half payment on the name of home loan
and flat at Lanco hills

131
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:42,583
When asked to take photo at the construction,

132
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:44,416
why did you give this photo?

133
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,125
Face is photogenic right, what is the problem?

134
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:53,791
I did not ask about face but about the place behind

135
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:58,165
Still, where can you see the sea from
top of that Lanco hills?

136
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,416
It may be the mistake of the photographer.

137
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,833
Next time, I will send it correctly

138
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,416
It is not the photo you should give,
but the amount taken

139
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:12,458
If not, sea in the photo will be the same
but you will not be on this earth

140
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:14,208
Bro, do not get hurt.

141
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:19,333
To repay all the debts somehow,
I just took a loan in Kazakhstan bank.

142
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:20,540
One minute...

143
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:23,333
Here is the cheque

144
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,083
Give that cheque to me,

145
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:27,583
they would stand similar even tomorrow

146
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:29,250
Brother, it is a mistake.

147
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:32,583
These are the Gods who saved me in my troubles

148
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:37,750
That God did not give me a boon going to the temple
but this priest gave me a loan

149
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:39,290
Oh God

150
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:43,125
This savior saved me when
I prayed to the Savior of the Universe

151
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:44,250
Oh Jesus!

152
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:50,000
This Basha believed in me
and gave money though I did not do Namaz

153
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:51,291
Hey God

154
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:55,041
Thus it is justified that I give money to them first

155
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:58,000
I would be ruined if I do justice for them,
I will not give, no chance

156
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:00,125
Bro, listen to me.
I will not give, no chance

157
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:01,166
You move aside son...

158
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:05,915
You take our money?
Oh God..!

159
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:09,250
Hey, this cheque is mine...

160
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:13,125
Idiot, you tore it all into pieces

161
00:17:13,415 --> 00:17:17,707
Oh God, it goes so if a cruel guy like him
is made into leader.

162
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:20,250
Cheque in hands is torn

163
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:21,458
You do not worry,

164
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,125
I will send once I receive another cheque.

165
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,333
Please come and take it

166
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:27,040
Ok son, we believe you.

167
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:28,500
Come on guys, move

168
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:30,416
Yes, move
come on..Move

169
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,750
I came giving up all prayers at the temple

170
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:38,000
Hey, though they let you go
I will not leave you

171
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:45,125
There is no chance of leaving you

172
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:57,957
Looks like he may die saying debt.

173
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:03,625
No idea which scape goat would
I get to repay his debt now

174
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,958
I will give you 30 crores Mr. Khan

175
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:14,708
30 Crores...

176
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:24,500
Are these any Diwali crackers to give a discount?

177
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,625
Antique pieces in the country!

178
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:31,125
Ok, I will give 50 crores

179
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:32,458
Deal ok

180
00:18:58,875 --> 00:18:59,916
Damn!

181
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:09,750
Hey Police, do you plan to catch me?

182
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,166
I will make a piracy with that.

183
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:16,583
You would not get even a small clue
however hard you try

184
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:21,957
Anyway, get flowers for free to your wife
on my name

185
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:23,833
Better luck next time

186
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:33,708
Has Venkat given?

187
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,541
Yes bro

188
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:39,541
Has this Prasad given then?

189
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:40,582
Yes bro

190
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:42,041
Very good

191
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,750
Then, has this Vara given?

192
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:46,541
No bro

193
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,666
What! has he not given even this week?

194
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:54,500
This fellow has not paid it any
week till now since we gave the loan bro

195
00:19:56,375 --> 00:20:01,500
Anybody in this place who plan
to take loan from me

196
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:04,208
They will have a fear about the moment of repaying it?

197
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:07,666
But why is this fellow frightening us?

198
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,333
Am I eligible for this business at all or not?

199
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:15,500
It happens if you give loans to
any chap producing an address proof

200
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:17,708
Still, why did you give loan to this bloody fellow?

201
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:25,000
As his blood group was B+ in his ID proof,
I felt he was very positive

202
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:28,541
But now I came to know now that he is negative

203
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:31,250
Hey, you do one thing.

204
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:35,125
Target everything related to him.

205
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:36,582
Target it...

206
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:26,707
Hey, why are you behaving like humans?

207
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:29,000
Do you not have sisters in your streets?

208
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:33,707
I am telling you decently..
go away from here. Go!

209
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:40,000
Hey, brother has not left any dog till now if he likes.

210
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:41,416
Move away decently, idiot

211
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:44,375
What? You will not listen to human language

212
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:48,458
Hey, come rascal... Let us see

213
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:50,625
Hey, come on run

214
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:52,916
You are finished today...Stop.

215
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:57,250
Hey, why are you chasing me?

216
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,457
Hey, give me my darling

217
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:13,041
Hey Banti, control your dogs. Please dude

218
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:15,583
I am dying to make this escape from that

219
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:17,166
It is very difficult boss.

220
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:21,000
Once if it commits, it does not listen even to me

221
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:22,416
So...
So...

222
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:24,333
Jump

223
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:40,250
I missed you.

224
00:22:41,791 --> 00:22:44,500
Why not call me when you go
for jogging at least for the safety of this?

225
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,625
I am behind you since one year..
why do you not consider me once?

226
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:51,291
There is no big difference between you and them.

227
00:22:53,791 --> 00:23:01,166
Hello, no chance of leaving you till you say
'Vara come here' in the place of 'go away'

228
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,625
No chance of leaving you too idiot

229
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,000
You are caught after a long time..

230
00:23:08,041 --> 00:23:08,582
Is it?

231
00:23:09,541 --> 00:23:11,582
Hello brother, is it you?
Yes, me

232
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:12,541
When would you give the money?

233
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:14,125
Come on the day after tomorrow bro

234
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:15,583
Will you definitely the give day after?

235
00:23:15,625 --> 00:23:17,208
No, I will tell about when?

236
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:18,250
What? Are you acting smart?

237
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:25,875
Money matters only till you give respect,
if not no money but just the punches

238
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,041
What Venkat, how did I ask your brother for money?

239
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:32,208
Bro, I will somehow repay the debt.

240
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:35,500
Believe me bro, it is me Vara

241
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:37,832
No, I do not have, go
Please brother, please

242
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:40,541
Go dude, do not trouble me go.

243
00:23:40,958 --> 00:23:41,500
Go dude

244
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,041
I will somehow repay this time bro...

245
00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:45,082
Go rascal

246
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:49,291
You have to give me loan bro...

247
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:51,291
Get up rascal...

248
00:23:51,583 --> 00:23:52,791
I will somehow repay bro...

249
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:54,875
Give that five lakhs given by that Srinu

250
00:23:56,375 --> 00:23:58,541
So, I too will give for sure if you ask in the same way

251
00:23:58,625 --> 00:23:59,916
Why do we give respect to you?

252
00:24:02,916 --> 00:24:03,541
Come on then

253
00:24:07,833 --> 00:24:11,583
Come bro..come on..
hit him

254
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:13,583
Hit him bro.

255
00:24:14,041 --> 00:24:14,832
Hey come here

256
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:16,416
Come on catch him.

257
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:17,125
Come idiot

258
00:24:25,041 --> 00:24:26,207
Come... will you hit?

259
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:28,333
Come, hit

260
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:30,583
Come, hit

261
00:24:34,916 --> 00:24:35,457
Come..

262
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,916
Come idiot... I got to talk, come...

263
00:24:38,375 --> 00:24:39,666
I will not hit you, come

264
00:24:39,791 --> 00:24:40,791
You will hit

265
00:24:43,416 --> 00:24:45,125
Why did you break the nose?

266
00:24:46,333 --> 00:24:47,750
Hey, I did not hit dude

267
00:24:50,041 --> 00:24:53,082
You said you will not hit and
left me unable to hit anything

268
00:24:53,958 --> 00:24:55,000
Hey, you come here

269
00:24:56,375 --> 00:24:59,041
Oh no, I will not come. I am out

270
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:02,666
Hey, leave bro
Hey, is it paining?

271
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:05,166
Oh no, it is paining a lot bro
Is it paining?

272
00:25:07,958 --> 00:25:11,625
Hey, when I decently asked for a loan..
what are you doing?

273
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Where is the respect guys?

274
00:25:15,666 --> 00:25:18,500
My feelings are hurt and my ego is irritated

275
00:25:18,875 --> 00:25:20,083
So what?
What, so what idiot?

276
00:25:20,666 --> 00:25:24,457
Satisfy my ego
and then we shall talk about the debt. Ok?

277
00:25:25,166 --> 00:25:26,166
Go
Ok

278
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:27,125
Hey
Yes

279
00:25:27,625 --> 00:25:30,291
Next time come with respect and not with men, ok?

280
00:25:30,333 --> 00:25:31,500
Okay.

281
00:25:32,333 --> 00:25:34,500
He should be given both money and respect it seems

282
00:25:35,125 --> 00:25:36,958
Come on guys, let us leave.
Our boss has no sense

283
00:25:39,125 --> 00:25:39,666
Hello sir

284
00:25:39,833 --> 00:25:41,333
Hello, please be seated

285
00:25:44,375 --> 00:25:46,833
How much time would you take to decode
the details in this?

286
00:25:59,583 --> 00:26:00,708
It would take a week minimum sir

287
00:26:00,958 --> 00:26:02,083
Sure?
Yes sir

288
00:26:02,375 --> 00:26:03,708
It is the most important to us

289
00:26:04,041 --> 00:26:05,791
Do not worry sir, I will take care of it

290
00:26:10,791 --> 00:26:11,457
Bye sir
Bye

291
00:26:12,916 --> 00:26:13,582
Supreet

292
00:26:14,416 --> 00:26:16,791
Be careful, none should know about this

293
00:26:17,291 --> 00:26:17,832
Ok sir

294
00:26:21,791 --> 00:26:23,500
I am frightened about the Police.

295
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:28,166
We are carrying out business in courage
thinking that you would be sincere right?

296
00:26:28,625 --> 00:26:30,666
Whom shall we believe if you do so yourself?

297
00:26:31,916 --> 00:26:35,707
You know how sincere would your
SI's be before me, before?

298
00:26:36,666 --> 00:26:39,041
They were doing justice to
every penny they took from me.

299
00:26:40,041 --> 00:26:43,125
How to escape if a sketch of two months
is informed two minutes before?

300
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:45,625
Sorry sir, I too came to know just now.

301
00:26:46,166 --> 00:26:47,332
I called immediately after I came to know.

302
00:26:47,958 --> 00:26:49,166
I work very sincerely sir.

303
00:26:49,791 --> 00:26:51,500
If needed, enquire from any goon in Vizag

304
00:26:51,916 --> 00:26:53,707
I came here to save you even now.

305
00:26:54,291 --> 00:26:55,625
You forgot the laptop while escaping

306
00:26:57,875 --> 00:27:01,625
Why did you leave such an important
briefcase like that, you rascals?

307
00:27:02,291 --> 00:27:03,291
That CI found that

308
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,916
He gave that brief case to decode
to a software engineer named Supreeth

309
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:07,958
and gave him time for a week

310
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,416
As we do not have so much time,
I will plan how to get that.

311
00:27:12,416 --> 00:27:13,125
And you apply it

312
00:27:13,458 --> 00:27:14,083
Good, good

313
00:27:15,458 --> 00:27:16,708
You understood what is said right?

314
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,208
Follow the plan of Sir

315
00:27:18,958 --> 00:27:21,875
We will all die if it misses this time.

316
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:24,916
Go guys

317
00:27:25,208 --> 00:27:25,833
Ok Sir
You too

318
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,416
Ok sir

319
00:27:39,041 --> 00:27:41,041
Respect, respect, respect!

320
00:27:42,625 --> 00:27:43,041
Ok!

321
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:48,333
Give him the respect he asked for
and bring the money we should get.

322
00:27:49,083 --> 00:27:50,416
Did you understand?
Understood bro

323
00:27:50,916 --> 00:27:51,375
Go

324
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:06,500
When you are before me and
when I am seeing you this way...

325
00:28:06,916 --> 00:28:09,832
My heart is pinched me...

326
00:28:34,541 --> 00:28:39,875
These girls give half hints pretending
not to see though seen, serious though smiling

327
00:28:46,541 --> 00:28:49,250
Hello friend here... Friend will come and sit.

328
00:28:50,708 --> 00:28:52,875
She is already sitting right? My legs are paining

329
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:53,875
My heart is paining here.

330
00:28:54,125 --> 00:28:54,875
Am I saying it out?

331
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:56,625
Damn, this guy is always so
Go idiot...

332
00:29:07,166 --> 00:29:11,000
I became very cheap to her as
I am behind her for an year.

333
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,791
No use now,

334
00:29:13,458 --> 00:29:14,958
I should create jealousy in her somehow

335
00:29:24,041 --> 00:29:26,166
Excuse me, can I sit here?

336
00:29:26,541 --> 00:29:27,916
Ok, sure... Be seated

337
00:29:29,125 --> 00:29:29,666
Okay.

338
00:29:31,041 --> 00:29:31,582
Thank you

339
00:29:35,291 --> 00:29:37,541
You are... I think I saw you somewhere

340
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:39,458
Is it?

341
00:29:41,375 --> 00:29:42,625
My name is Vara and you are?

342
00:29:42,958 --> 00:29:43,583
Jasmine

343
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,125
Jasmine

344
00:29:47,875 --> 00:29:49,958
Fragrance was a wow as and when you were coming.

345
00:29:50,166 --> 00:29:51,750
Jasmine... Jasmine flower...

346
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,457
You too look great just like your name

347
00:29:56,041 --> 00:29:56,916
Is it true?

348
00:29:57,333 --> 00:29:58,875
Oh no, really true

349
00:29:59,125 --> 00:29:59,833
Yes! it's true.

350
00:30:00,541 --> 00:30:04,666
You are looking just like
Toliprema Keerthi Reddy in this dress

351
00:30:04,916 --> 00:30:06,791
He too says the same always.

352
00:30:07,541 --> 00:30:08,416
Who is he?

353
00:30:08,625 --> 00:30:11,250
If I am Keerthi Reddy of Toliprema, he is Pawan Kalyan

354
00:30:11,583 --> 00:30:13,291
There, he is my to be husband

355
00:30:15,666 --> 00:30:18,291
See, you said no Idiot
other than you would praise me right?

356
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,458
Oh, is he an idiot too?

357
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:22,082
Why to discuss those things now?

358
00:30:40,458 --> 00:30:43,166
Girls bring in love even in Robots with these smiles

359
00:30:54,375 --> 00:30:54,791
Please...

360
00:30:54,833 --> 00:30:56,791
I feel like I have seen you somewhere

361
00:30:57,375 --> 00:30:58,875
Oh..!
Is it?

362
00:31:00,958 --> 00:31:03,958
My name is Vara and your name?
Oh no, please no

363
00:31:04,541 --> 00:31:06,625
Jasmine... Super!

364
00:31:07,125 --> 00:31:09,958
You too are great just like your name

365
00:31:10,458 --> 00:31:11,000
Will you stop?

366
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,916
Will you, please...

367
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:17,250
Keerthi Reddy in Toliprema...

368
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:18,833
Why am I booked like this?

369
00:31:21,375 --> 00:31:22,750
You are Pawan Kalyan...

370
00:31:24,833 --> 00:31:26,958
Stop it, please...

371
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,166
Hey Julie, what a surprise?

372
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:34,000
You invited for coffee right?

373
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,958
Ok... One minute

374
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:41,166
I am ready...

375
00:33:43,541 --> 00:33:43,957
Shall we go?

376
00:33:44,333 --> 00:33:44,875
Where?

377
00:33:45,375 --> 00:33:46,916
I mean, for having coffee

378
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,416
I do not have the habit of
having coffee outside

379
00:34:22,416 --> 00:34:31,250
Seeing you in me and me in you...
The time being spent is great

380
00:34:33,833 --> 00:34:44,250
The hidden secrets being written with eyes in air.
It is a surprise when life is reading that

381
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:50,708
When you come near distance is gone reverse

382
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,375
When you smile the weight is going in reverse

383
00:34:56,625 --> 00:35:02,000
Is this minute true, truth feels an unbelievable dream

384
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:07,791
Is this minute true, truth feels an unbelievable dream

385
00:35:08,125 --> 00:35:17,000
Seeing you in me and me in you...
The time being spent is great

386
00:35:19,416 --> 00:35:28,416
The hidden secrets being written with eyes in air
It is a surprise when life is reading that

387
00:35:42,416 --> 00:35:47,500
It says not to delay anymore

388
00:35:48,125 --> 00:35:53,250
My heart carrying greed in hopes says so

389
00:35:53,833 --> 00:35:59,291
The lust growing in every nerve came to the lip ends

390
00:35:59,541 --> 00:36:05,000
Said to say the truth unable
to bear seeing you before me

391
00:36:05,291 --> 00:36:14,250
Seeing you in me and me in you...
The time being spent is great

392
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:26,375
The hidden secrets being written with eyes in air
It is a surprise when life is reading that

393
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:56,166
The sky is watching it all silently

394
00:36:56,708 --> 00:37:01,541
Hiding flowers in the blue clouds of it

395
00:37:02,375 --> 00:37:07,750
It is driving the heart haunting to ask fast

396
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:13,666
It asked to open up before this minute
turns into second

397
00:37:13,833 --> 00:37:22,625
Seeing you in me and me in you...
The time being spent is great

398
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:34,541
The hidden secrets being written with eyes in air
It is a surprise when life is reading that

399
00:38:40,583 --> 00:38:42,500
Hey, we gave great respect towards bro right?

400
00:38:42,583 --> 00:38:44,041
Yes bro, we gave

401
00:38:44,083 --> 00:38:47,083
You asked for respect right bro?
We too came with great respect...

402
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:48,708
You are happy right?

403
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,458
Respect is all fine but...

404
00:38:52,958 --> 00:38:53,541
But...

405
00:38:53,833 --> 00:38:54,791
But...

406
00:38:58,166 --> 00:38:59,625
Will he give the money?
I doubt bro

407
00:39:02,166 --> 00:39:02,708
Hello

408
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:06,541
Sir, we are calling from ICICI bank.
You took a personal loan right?

409
00:39:06,833 --> 00:39:09,708
We have to talk about those payments.
Are you free sir?

410
00:39:10,083 --> 00:39:11,708
Say again...

411
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:13,583
Sir, we are calling from ICICI bank...

412
00:39:13,708 --> 00:39:16,583
You took a personal loan
and we need to talk about those payments.

413
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:17,750
Are you free?

414
00:39:18,041 --> 00:39:18,791
We can talk right?

415
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:21,791
That is called respect.

416
00:39:22,833 --> 00:39:24,375
See how updated are the bank people?

417
00:39:24,541 --> 00:39:25,083
Yes.

418
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:32,583
To collect money from debtors, they arranged girls,
are giving great respect and are asking for repayment...

419
00:39:32,916 --> 00:39:33,458
So...

420
00:39:33,708 --> 00:39:34,250
So..

421
00:39:35,125 --> 00:39:36,625
You go, tell to your brother.

422
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:40,708
Arrange for cute girls, come and ask then
and I shall then think about it

423
00:39:41,333 --> 00:39:43,791
Why do ask to supply girls when
we asked to pay money, idiot?

424
00:39:43,875 --> 00:39:45,833
Huh, respect is missing again...

425
00:40:08,708 --> 00:40:11,000
Happy birthday sister
Thank you

426
00:40:14,166 --> 00:40:16,375
You should live happily for whole life dear

427
00:40:16,833 --> 00:40:17,833
Thank you granny

428
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,833
Happy birthday

429
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:20,250
Thank you

430
00:40:33,333 --> 00:40:33,791
Welcome...

431
00:41:05,708 --> 00:41:08,000
Happy birthday to you...

432
00:41:08,708 --> 00:41:11,041
Happy birthday to you...

433
00:41:12,208 --> 00:41:14,541
Happy birthday to you...

434
00:41:48,416 --> 00:41:49,208
Happy birthday Julie...

435
00:41:50,791 --> 00:41:52,041
Thank you so much

436
00:41:52,083 --> 00:41:53,083
Hey, it is ok

437
00:41:53,583 --> 00:41:54,375
When do we marry?

438
00:41:54,666 --> 00:41:56,750
Shall I talk with your parents or will you talk?

439
00:41:56,958 --> 00:41:58,125
Hey wait, stop!

440
00:41:59,125 --> 00:41:59,750
What marriage?

441
00:42:00,583 --> 00:42:04,208
Julie, I impressed you a lot and you too got impressed

442
00:42:05,125 --> 00:42:07,166
What is the problem now? Next is the marriage right?

443
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:10,541
Listen, you do not have so much weightage

444
00:42:12,083 --> 00:42:18,000
Boys these days are planning birthdays
of girlfriends richer than Independence Day

445
00:42:19,125 --> 00:42:23,291
Maybe any girl would go flat for
such cheap tricks but not this Julie

446
00:42:23,333 --> 00:42:25,625
Ok, why when not flat? Give that ring back.

447
00:42:26,416 --> 00:42:28,416
I will give to a girl getting flat and impress here

448
00:42:29,416 --> 00:42:33,291
Sorry, I do not have a habit of giving back once received

449
00:42:35,541 --> 00:42:39,291
Hey, you are already flat.
You do not understand

450
00:42:39,833 --> 00:42:42,166
You will not get a guy like me.
Give it a thought.

451
00:42:46,958 --> 00:42:48,125
Hey
Brother

452
00:42:48,625 --> 00:42:51,125
Has this Raju given?
Yes brother

453
00:42:51,666 --> 00:42:52,708
Good

454
00:42:54,416 --> 00:42:57,333
Then, has this Ravi given?

455
00:42:57,416 --> 00:42:57,958
Yes brother

456
00:42:58,416 --> 00:42:59,875
Very, very good

457
00:43:01,958 --> 00:43:04,958
Then, has this Vara given?

458
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:06,458
No brother, it seems we should give in return

459
00:43:06,583 --> 00:43:09,125
What is that? I said to give the respect he asked for, right?

460
00:43:09,166 --> 00:43:09,916
Did you not give?

461
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:11,708
We gave brother?
Then what?

462
00:43:12,291 --> 00:43:13,625
It seems he want babes, bro

463
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:15,333
What babes?

464
00:43:15,625 --> 00:43:20,041
As the respect we are giving is not enough,
next time he wants us to come with babes

465
00:43:20,166 --> 00:43:25,291
Oh, will he not repay unless we get him
massaged with babes?

466
00:43:27,958 --> 00:43:29,000
Ok, I understood.

467
00:43:30,125 --> 00:43:31,333
He will not give

468
00:43:32,041 --> 00:43:33,750
I understood now

469
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,416
We understood long back bro

470
00:43:36,166 --> 00:43:38,041
We have been waiting when you would understand

471
00:43:41,375 --> 00:43:44,416
I know very well how to get back his loan.

472
00:43:44,708 --> 00:43:45,875
This time not with you...

473
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:51,500
There is a guy who can collect
money from him along with the interest

474
00:44:28,416 --> 00:44:30,500
You asked me to get the money from that Subbarao right?

475
00:44:31,125 --> 00:44:31,791
I asked him money

476
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:34,375
He said not to have and I said I have no patience.

477
00:44:34,916 --> 00:44:36,666
I cut and brought the kidney

478
00:44:36,875 --> 00:44:37,875
Kidney?

479
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:38,708
Yes, Kidney!

480
00:44:39,166 --> 00:44:43,375
I also brought a guy to buy this. You deal with him

481
00:44:44,125 --> 00:44:46,750
Hey, this is brother Gun Laden. Salute him

482
00:44:46,791 --> 00:44:47,916
Hello brother

483
00:44:48,458 --> 00:44:51,000
He is not an ordinary man.
Come on give it here

484
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Look into his matter too

485
00:44:57,416 --> 00:44:58,708
Who is this boy, so tender?

486
00:44:59,291 --> 00:45:02,375
He looks tender but is very dangerous

487
00:45:03,166 --> 00:45:03,833
More than me?

488
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,666
Not more than you, but a bit...

489
00:45:08,083 --> 00:45:10,333
You gave the photo right? Your work will be done

490
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:14,250
I am telling you something for your good.
Do not praise anyone before me

491
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:18,083
I, myself do not know what I would cut in that frustration

492
00:45:22,708 --> 00:45:24,250
Hey Bunty, lend me Fifty thousand.

493
00:45:24,458 --> 00:45:25,375
I urgently need it dude.

494
00:45:25,541 --> 00:45:27,458
You first repay the earlier amount
I will give everything at once

495
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:28,500
Hey, look... some car has come

496
00:45:32,166 --> 00:45:32,750
Good evening sir

497
00:45:35,333 --> 00:45:36,833
Hello Sir
Hello

498
00:45:58,666 --> 00:45:59,750
Hey, you rascal

499
00:46:02,083 --> 00:46:02,625
Yes, come here

500
00:46:07,541 --> 00:46:09,791
You, idiot come

501
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:22,250
Who are you?

502
00:46:22,875 --> 00:46:25,833
Why do need who I am?
When are you giving the money?

503
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:28,500
You mean cash?
Yes

504
00:46:29,208 --> 00:46:29,791
One minute..

505
00:46:36,625 --> 00:46:38,208
Still, your face is connecting nowhere

506
00:46:38,625 --> 00:46:40,041
Your face is connecting to me

507
00:46:40,375 --> 00:46:43,708
What? It seems we should give you
respect for you to repay us the money?

508
00:46:43,916 --> 00:46:44,625
Will you not give otherwise?

509
00:46:44,916 --> 00:46:46,732
Oh, you are a person of Bangaru Shetty?

510
00:46:47,583 --> 00:46:48,500
He is my man

511
00:46:49,541 --> 00:46:53,750
Still, I said him to send babes
and why has he sent this item?

512
00:46:54,208 --> 00:46:54,833
Item?

513
00:47:36,333 --> 00:47:38,250
Bloody hell... Hey!

514
00:47:40,833 --> 00:47:43,583
Come on, you have not said that you have a gun right bro?

515
00:47:43,916 --> 00:47:44,791
Sorry brother

516
00:47:45,791 --> 00:47:47,625
Yes, you understood right?

517
00:47:48,208 --> 00:47:48,916
I just missed earlier,

518
00:47:49,458 --> 00:47:52,375
it will not miss now and the bullet goes into the target

519
00:47:52,625 --> 00:47:54,875
I will repay it placed in flowers
by tomorrow afternoon bro.

520
00:47:55,500 --> 00:48:00,500
I thought Bangaru Shetty would send a figure,
but did not expect that he would send five feet bullet bro

521
00:48:01,166 --> 00:48:06,166
Hey, I am not Bangaru Shetty to get beaten by you
or to go flat when you praise

522
00:48:06,875 --> 00:48:09,250
Laden... Gun Laden here...

523
00:48:09,666 --> 00:48:11,583
That is why I was afraid
and agreed to pay the money bro

524
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:13,041
Ok,

525
00:48:13,875 --> 00:48:16,500
I will be with you till tomorrow afternoon
and will leave if you repay the money

526
00:48:16,958 --> 00:48:18,208
Why so much trouble for you bro?

527
00:48:18,833 --> 00:48:20,208
I do not trust

528
00:48:20,708 --> 00:48:24,541
His audio and the video here
are not at all syncing

529
00:48:25,125 --> 00:48:26,416
I will take if you give,

530
00:48:26,875 --> 00:48:30,083
if not I will cut and take whatever I like

531
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:33,208
Bro, one minute
Go on, talk

532
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Hello
Hey Vara,

533
00:48:37,583 --> 00:48:39,625
we shall drop Supreet sir. Bring the car fast

534
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:41,500
Yes, I am coming
I too will come

535
00:48:41,791 --> 00:48:42,541
Where are you coming bro?

536
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,791
Ok, move bro. You have the gun right?

537
00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:01,791
Hello sir

538
00:49:05,375 --> 00:49:07,750
Hey, briefcase

539
00:49:11,333 --> 00:49:11,875
It is not there sir

540
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:13,208
In the front

541
00:49:18,958 --> 00:49:21,416
I have seen everywhere sir, there is no briefcase

542
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:22,625
No briefcase?

543
00:49:24,166 --> 00:49:24,916
See in the hatch

544
00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:25,791
Ok sir

545
00:49:32,458 --> 00:49:32,958
Where...

546
00:49:33,666 --> 00:49:34,541
It is not there even in the hatch sir

547
00:49:36,875 --> 00:49:37,666
This is not my car.

548
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:39,125
Where is my car?

549
00:49:39,875 --> 00:49:40,875
Where is my car?

550
00:49:41,458 --> 00:49:42,666
Sir, one minute

551
00:49:44,125 --> 00:49:45,708
Hey, which car did you take?

552
00:49:45,958 --> 00:49:47,458
White car of a customer is missing here

553
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:48,750
Hey, just cover it up.

554
00:49:48,875 --> 00:49:51,125
I brought that car in tension
and will be there in 10 minutes.

555
00:49:52,541 --> 00:49:55,458
I am really sorry sir, I brought
another car in a small confusion.

556
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:57,708
Your car will be with you,
if you give me half an hour time sir

557
00:49:59,166 --> 00:50:01,333
My car should be in front of my house in half an hour.

558
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:03,416
Briefcase in that is very important

559
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:05,583
I am saying again, briefcase is very important

560
00:50:05,875 --> 00:50:06,750
Ok sir.
Hey, move...

561
00:50:06,833 --> 00:50:07,625
He is saying right?

562
00:50:07,666 --> 00:50:08,708
Where are you going?

563
00:50:09,416 --> 00:50:10,958
You should be right here till the car comes

564
00:50:11,166 --> 00:50:13,791
Hey, I have work with him till tomorrow afternoon

565
00:50:14,541 --> 00:50:16,916
Bro, please bro. If not my job will be gone bro.

566
00:50:17,333 --> 00:50:18,416
I will come fast, please bro

567
00:50:19,791 --> 00:50:20,791
Ok, say your number

568
00:50:26,458 --> 00:50:28,875
I gave a missed call, this number is mine.
I got the number bro, ok bro

569
00:50:28,916 --> 00:50:31,583
You should be calling me every five minutes, understood?

570
00:50:31,708 --> 00:50:32,250
Understood bro

571
00:50:32,625 --> 00:50:34,541
I am like a six feet bullet.

572
00:50:34,666 --> 00:50:37,458
If you do something wrong, bullets will get inside

573
00:50:37,583 --> 00:50:39,833
Oh no, I know about you bro. I will come in half an hour
Yes, go now

574
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,458
It is very cold outside right?
Yes, it is good

575
00:50:51,375 --> 00:50:52,708
Come, let us go inside

576
00:50:53,375 --> 00:50:54,250
Come, let us go in to my room

577
00:51:01,375 --> 00:51:04,125
What is this? A phone call from her for the first time

578
00:51:05,291 --> 00:51:09,333
It always was an outgoing from me
and what is this for a change from her?

579
00:51:09,791 --> 00:51:12,708
By chance, is this a reaction for
my birthday scene of yesterday?

580
00:51:19,416 --> 00:51:20,583
Hello, where are you?

581
00:51:21,375 --> 00:51:21,916
I am outside

582
00:51:22,083 --> 00:51:23,208
I need to urgently talk to you

583
00:51:23,541 --> 00:51:23,958
Tell me

584
00:51:24,458 --> 00:51:27,458
Come to table number 9 in Hotel Taj in half an hour

585
00:51:28,416 --> 00:51:28,958
Do not delay, bye

586
00:51:30,416 --> 00:51:31,166
Ok, bye

587
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:55,333
Oh no,

588
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:57,833
what is he giving signals?

589
00:51:58,333 --> 00:51:59,791
By chance is he into guys?

590
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,041
What is this dirty thing from him?

591
00:52:14,583 --> 00:52:18,708
Escaping from him is like swimming in Tsunami

592
00:52:19,666 --> 00:52:20,666
I should escape cleverly

593
00:52:25,208 --> 00:52:26,833
Why are you so tensed?

594
00:52:34,375 --> 00:52:38,125
Though you are into software, you look so hard.

595
00:52:38,625 --> 00:52:40,041
I am soft right?

596
00:52:42,375 --> 00:52:45,416
You got fresh and let me too go and fresh up.

597
00:52:46,125 --> 00:52:48,250
All such things should be done getting fresh

598
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:52,958
You said it so cutely.. go fresh up and come

599
00:52:54,458 --> 00:52:55,250
Come fast..

600
00:52:59,791 --> 00:53:02,083
Come fast dear, please

601
00:53:02,208 --> 00:53:02,916
Sure dear

602
00:53:06,791 --> 00:53:07,958
What should I do now?

603
00:53:11,708 --> 00:53:14,333
Damn, it is a sin even to touch his hands

604
00:53:16,291 --> 00:53:17,958
How do I escape now from him?

605
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:26,375
This fellow has booked me, what to do now?

606
00:53:44,125 --> 00:53:44,666
Hey,

607
00:53:45,291 --> 00:53:46,000
who are you rascal?

608
00:53:46,041 --> 00:53:47,625
Where is the briefcase given by the Police?

609
00:53:47,916 --> 00:53:49,541
I have no link with the Police.

610
00:53:49,958 --> 00:53:51,125
Oh no, is it true?

611
00:53:51,791 --> 00:53:55,250
Agree decently, I know that Commissioner
gave you the briefcase

612
00:53:55,333 --> 00:53:56,125
I really do not know

613
00:53:56,208 --> 00:53:56,750
Hey, say rascal... Say

614
00:53:57,250 --> 00:53:58,333
Wait..
Come on..Say

615
00:53:58,541 --> 00:54:01,166
Do not harm me. That briefcase is not with me now.

616
00:54:01,291 --> 00:54:01,708
It is true

617
00:54:15,083 --> 00:54:15,583
Oh no!

618
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:43,875
No, it is just one bullet left...

619
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:14,791
Hello...

620
00:55:16,291 --> 00:55:17,791
Go, please go

621
00:55:27,666 --> 00:55:28,708
What is this voice message?

622
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:31,708
What short fellow, are you six feel long bullet?

623
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
You are not even three feet...

624
00:55:34,375 --> 00:55:37,041
By the way, it seems that software guy is a big item too

625
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:40,583
So enjoy yourself because
I am going out on a personal work.

626
00:55:40,958 --> 00:55:42,041
I will be back after two days.

627
00:55:42,208 --> 00:55:46,375
That is why I am leaving that before his house and going.

628
00:55:46,625 --> 00:55:47,166
Take it.

629
00:55:49,375 --> 00:55:50,000
Outside the house?

630
00:55:50,625 --> 00:55:53,250
Where did you keep it, idiot?

631
00:56:01,958 --> 00:56:02,916
I should keep it safe

632
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,833
What is this valet parking job dude?

633
00:56:08,583 --> 00:56:09,416
Where is my Bullet.

634
00:56:10,916 --> 00:56:12,916
Hey boy, come here

635
00:56:12,958 --> 00:56:13,625
Hey, wait for a minute

636
00:56:16,666 --> 00:56:17,333
Has Vara come?

637
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:18,333
Yes, he came

638
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:19,416
Where is he?

639
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:21,541
He just came and left to drop a car.

640
00:56:22,041 --> 00:56:22,708
Will he come back again?

641
00:56:22,916 --> 00:56:23,625
He will never come back again

642
00:56:23,791 --> 00:56:24,208
Why?

643
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:25,500
Because he quit the job from today

644
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:27,583
Do you know his address?

645
00:56:27,958 --> 00:56:28,416
No.

646
00:56:28,916 --> 00:56:29,458
You do not know?

647
00:56:30,416 --> 00:56:32,875
Ok, what happened to the bullet I had parked here?

648
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,583
Oh, was that yours?
Yes, mine

649
00:56:35,041 --> 00:56:37,250
Vara has just sold it for
twenty thousand saying it belongs to him

650
00:56:38,708 --> 00:56:40,000
How much?
20000

651
00:56:40,541 --> 00:56:41,208
20000?

652
00:56:42,416 --> 00:56:46,583
Rascal, I lost my bike coming to collect money from you.

653
00:56:47,083 --> 00:56:48,625
I would have even lost my modesty.

654
00:56:49,416 --> 00:56:52,416
You have finally got me into a murder case too,
you rascal...

655
00:56:54,016 --> 00:56:56,958
Hey.. no chance that I would let you go...

656
00:56:57,541 --> 00:56:58,333
I will teach you a lesson.

657
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:24,875
I thought you may delay, you came in time.

658
00:57:25,250 --> 00:57:26,500
Yes, my time is so

659
00:57:26,958 --> 00:57:29,291
Why did you suddenly call and asked me to meet?

660
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:30,166
She is like that

661
00:57:31,833 --> 00:57:33,333
She plans everything suddenly

662
00:57:35,458 --> 00:57:36,583
Vara, mom and dad!

663
00:57:37,583 --> 00:57:38,833
Hello uncle, hello aunty

664
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:40,166
Hello

665
00:57:40,750 --> 00:57:42,375
I told you about Vara right?

666
00:57:43,041 --> 00:57:45,666
Here, I presented him before you. I think my work is done

667
00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:46,791
Sit dear

668
00:57:47,491 --> 00:57:48,383
Sit..

669
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:51,833
Thank you uncle

670
00:57:53,916 --> 00:57:55,708
Vara, I explained about us.

671
00:57:56,291 --> 00:57:57,500
You talk a bit carefully

672
00:57:58,333 --> 00:58:00,833
Dad, you guys carry on and I will leave

673
00:58:01,625 --> 00:58:03,833
What is it dear? You planned all this, right?

674
00:58:04,416 --> 00:58:05,625
How can you leave now?

675
00:58:08,041 --> 00:58:11,208
Only I will have to speak
if I am here and he will not.

676
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:11,958
That is why...

677
00:58:13,208 --> 00:58:15,875
What is it Julie? You booked me
alone here and why are you escaping?

678
00:58:17,541 --> 00:58:20,750
This proposal is easier than proposing
with a ring on the road, right?

679
00:58:22,666 --> 00:58:23,750
You guys take care, bye...

680
00:58:25,875 --> 00:58:26,416
Hey, Julie...

681
00:58:26,625 --> 00:58:27,625
What will you have son?

682
00:58:28,291 --> 00:58:29,125
As you wish aunty

683
00:58:29,875 --> 00:58:30,625
What did you study?

684
00:58:31,666 --> 00:58:33,916
I do not have big qualities like degree uncle

685
00:58:34,875 --> 00:58:35,583
What is your profession?

686
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:37,291
Valet parking driver

687
00:58:38,291 --> 00:58:38,833
What, driver?

688
00:58:41,458 --> 00:58:46,541
Saying auto driver or taxi driver
with people like you, you hate.

689
00:58:47,041 --> 00:58:50,750
And if I drive a plane, you get surprised saying a pilot

690
00:58:52,333 --> 00:58:56,291
The money earned is more important
for you than the work uncle

691
00:58:57,791 --> 00:58:58,541
One minute uncle...

692
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:25,750
Baby said that you love her. How do I believe?

693
00:59:27,625 --> 00:59:30,166
Uncle, what you drank is mineral water?

694
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:31,250
Yes

695
00:59:31,958 --> 00:59:33,375
Show me minerals in this

696
00:59:34,041 --> 00:59:34,458
What?

697
00:59:36,083 --> 00:59:39,166
When some guy brought it saying mineral water,
you drank it and believed

698
00:59:39,916 --> 00:59:42,000
But when your girl said she loves, will you not believe?

699
00:59:43,958 --> 00:59:45,916
Good, I believe but...

700
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:49,250
I bought a car as my daughter likes.

701
00:59:49,791 --> 00:59:50,541
I bought her jewellery,

702
00:59:50,958 --> 00:59:53,291
I even bought a puppy.

703
00:59:53,791 --> 00:59:55,833
Saying so, I cannot give everything right?

704
00:59:56,208 --> 00:59:58,083
Not everything sir, say you cannot give me

705
00:59:58,166 --> 00:59:59,166
You got it correctly

706
01:00:00,083 --> 01:00:06,541
No education, no bank balance, not from same caste,
you are after all a valet parking driver

707
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:10,458
How do I get her married to a guy like you?
You say it yourself.

708
01:00:11,916 --> 01:00:13,958
I understood clearly, say what shall I do now?

709
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:29,958
Daddy, did you like Vara?

710
01:00:31,083 --> 01:00:33,041
I liked the boy very much dear

711
01:00:33,916 --> 01:00:34,708
Thank God!

712
01:00:35,416 --> 01:00:37,083
I know that you will like him

713
01:00:37,833 --> 01:00:41,625
Your dad said he likes him not for
getting Vara married to you.

714
01:00:43,541 --> 01:00:44,125
What is it?

715
01:00:48,125 --> 01:00:51,250
How much do you need to sell your love on my daughter?

716
01:00:53,666 --> 01:00:54,666
Give me ten Lakhs

717
01:00:59,125 --> 01:00:59,666
Are you sure?

718
01:01:00,041 --> 01:01:00,625
Sure uncle

719
01:01:11,083 --> 01:01:13,125
Here, take and leave my daughter.

720
01:01:13,666 --> 01:01:15,541
Never come near our Julie again.

721
01:01:31,333 --> 01:01:32,708
But on one condition uncle,

722
01:01:33,333 --> 01:01:40,750
saying that I left her if you get her married to
a bald headed software guy or an idiot staying abroad,

723
01:01:41,250 --> 01:01:42,000
I will not agree

724
01:01:42,666 --> 01:01:45,583
She till date had good father and a good mother.

725
01:01:45,791 --> 01:01:49,875
Similarly she has a good ex-lover from today.

726
01:01:50,583 --> 01:01:54,750
So, we all together will look for a good match
for her and get her married greatly.

727
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:56,916
Her future should be good too, right uncle?

728
01:01:57,291 --> 01:02:00,500
That is why I am splitting here with her
on with that condition.

729
01:02:02,125 --> 01:02:05,041
If something goes wrong...
Come on son, no worries.

730
01:02:05,458 --> 01:02:07,000
We shall look for a good match and get her married.

731
01:02:08,250 --> 01:02:10,583
Ok then... Bye, take care

732
01:02:41,791 --> 01:02:42,500
Hey Vara,

733
01:02:43,333 --> 01:02:49,083
you swiped our bank debit and credit cards at your will
and when I came to ask for money,

734
01:02:49,625 --> 01:02:51,500
do you make get on to this hospital bed?

735
01:02:51,916 --> 01:02:53,458
You hit me when I asked decently?

736
01:02:53,666 --> 01:02:56,583
I am now coming drunk to ask
and I will see what you do.

737
01:02:56,791 --> 01:02:57,875
I am coming Vara

738
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:01,875
You idiot

739
01:03:02,708 --> 01:03:08,750
your situation is like bringing the thorn bush
flying in the air to your face

740
01:03:09,291 --> 01:03:13,916
If the police get to know about this,
you will be finished Laden...

741
01:03:15,125 --> 01:03:18,000
Hello, are you over drunk?

742
01:03:18,125 --> 01:03:20,125
Laden is finished long back right?

743
01:03:20,458 --> 01:03:21,541
Do you not know that?

744
01:03:21,875 --> 01:03:22,791
You fool!

745
01:03:23,083 --> 01:03:25,375
The Laden you are talking about is different
from the Laden I am talking about

746
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:30,333
I mean, there is a Laden I know
and is there another Laden?

747
01:03:30,791 --> 01:03:33,125
I should confirm this matter.

748
01:03:33,750 --> 01:03:35,500
Yes, this guy is correct

749
01:03:35,666 --> 01:03:36,500
Come on, go.

750
01:03:37,333 --> 01:03:40,833
He is dead in my hands today
He is already dead

751
01:03:41,166 --> 01:03:42,041
Who killed him?

752
01:03:42,250 --> 01:03:43,666
It is him who should kill him...

753
01:03:43,833 --> 01:03:45,875
Come on, stop your dirty comedies

754
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,083
Americans killed him long back
and this fellow will kill now it seems

755
01:03:49,125 --> 01:03:50,208
Have Americans killed?

756
01:03:50,250 --> 01:03:50,666
Yes

757
01:03:50,750 --> 01:03:52,375
Has he even taken loans from there?

758
01:03:52,750 --> 01:03:55,541
Laden did mistakes, has he even taken loans?

759
01:03:56,416 --> 01:03:59,583
That means does he commits
mistakes too along with debts?

760
01:03:59,625 --> 01:04:01,583
That is why they killed him

761
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:05,750
I am not knowing whom are you talking about?

762
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:09,708
Oh no! Do you not know... Osama Bin Laden!

763
01:04:11,375 --> 01:04:12,000
One minute...

764
01:04:13,083 --> 01:04:14,541
Oh no, he hit me...

765
01:04:15,125 --> 01:04:16,916
They killed him long back, right?

766
01:04:17,166 --> 01:04:21,208
You may have hit, but gave a correct clarity

767
01:04:21,458 --> 01:04:24,958
I will bring that fellow and say the
same thing even to him bro

768
01:04:25,041 --> 01:04:25,583
I will say

769
01:04:25,625 --> 01:04:26,458
You be right here,

770
01:04:26,625 --> 01:04:28,375
I will say...
I will bring him

771
01:04:28,458 --> 01:04:29,750
You be right here, I will bring him
I will say

772
01:04:31,041 --> 01:04:31,750
where is this guy?

773
01:04:32,250 --> 01:04:34,708
That is why they said never to believe drunkards.

774
01:04:35,083 --> 01:04:35,791
He is not here.

775
01:04:40,875 --> 01:04:42,000
Brother, that fellow is not there

776
01:04:42,125 --> 01:04:43,208
Who, Laden?

777
01:04:43,541 --> 01:04:45,416
The guy who said he would finish Laden

778
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:49,875
Not like this, you wait a minute dude...

779
01:04:50,916 --> 01:04:52,208
Oh no, he is hit again

780
01:04:52,250 --> 01:04:54,916
Why are you talking now about
a guy dead long back?

781
01:04:54,958 --> 01:04:55,666
Warrior...

782
01:04:55,708 --> 01:05:00,791
Not so, you will not get sense unless
you hit with shoe and not with hands, get out

783
01:05:01,416 --> 01:05:04,333
I am already in great frustration
as that fellow has not given money,

784
01:05:05,083 --> 01:05:07,000
I should somehow kill that guy today

785
01:05:07,416 --> 01:05:08,458
What is this life?

786
01:05:09,416 --> 01:05:11,375
Drinking here and disposing there.

787
01:05:11,625 --> 01:05:13,208
This fellow is not lifting the phone

788
01:05:38,291 --> 01:05:38,708
Tell me

789
01:05:39,208 --> 01:05:42,500
A valet parking driver of a star hotel had
dropped Supreeth an hour back

790
01:05:42,916 --> 01:05:45,291
Supreeth car is missing here and that guy is missing there

791
01:05:46,333 --> 01:05:48,791
I think, we may know these case details catching him.

792
01:05:49,291 --> 01:05:50,833
Maybe the briefcase is in the car too

793
01:05:51,541 --> 01:05:52,250
What is his name?

794
01:05:53,541 --> 01:05:54,125
Vara?

795
01:05:54,625 --> 01:05:55,041
Yes sir

796
01:05:55,708 --> 01:05:56,708
After your men left,

797
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:00,083
even our Police team that went there has
searched his entire house for that briefcase

798
01:06:00,375 --> 01:06:01,500
We too did not find that briefcase

799
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:04,458
A car parking guy has eloped with that car

800
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,333
Maybe that briefcase is in that car

801
01:06:07,541 --> 01:06:09,708
Our work gets easy catching him, Khan Saab

802
01:06:10,166 --> 01:06:11,250
Who is that fellow?
Vara

803
01:06:12,041 --> 01:06:15,875
That Vara should be before me in 24 hours

804
01:06:31,958 --> 01:06:33,125
you worked out very nicely.

805
01:06:34,750 --> 01:06:38,125
Oh no! looks like her dad delivered the total
matter happening in the hotel.

806
01:06:39,416 --> 01:06:40,291
What is working out?

807
01:06:41,708 --> 01:06:45,000
You worked out your business deal
well with my daddy

808
01:06:46,041 --> 01:06:51,083
But, you just asked Ten lakhs for your love.

809
01:06:52,625 --> 01:06:58,250
If you had asked, my dad would have given
away total property for his love on me

810
01:07:00,625 --> 01:07:01,458
I trusted..

811
01:07:03,541 --> 01:07:07,833
Thought you are my shadow
as you were coming everywhere I was going

812
01:07:09,083 --> 01:07:14,000
I thought you like me a lot as you were
giving so many gifts for birthday

813
01:07:16,166 --> 01:07:20,583
You did not even touch me though
I was with you for a whole night...

814
01:07:23,083 --> 01:07:24,291
I thought you were my confidence

815
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:31,541
Any girl seeing all these will think it is love

816
01:07:33,458 --> 01:07:34,625
I too thought the same

817
01:07:37,333 --> 01:07:38,875
But, I am cheated

818
01:07:40,083 --> 01:07:41,833
Why are you using such big words?

819
01:07:42,750 --> 01:07:43,916
When did I cheat you?

820
01:07:45,333 --> 01:07:46,416
I did not cheat anyone,

821
01:07:47,208 --> 01:07:49,250
I saved myself from being cheated

822
01:07:51,208 --> 01:07:56,916
A boy sees a girl, follows her,
likes her, learns her tastes,

823
01:07:57,125 --> 01:07:59,166
changes his life style as per that,

824
01:07:59,458 --> 01:08:04,833
tries every minute how he should
impress her, thinks every minute about her...

825
01:08:06,666 --> 01:08:12,041
Sacrifice our career and whole future
for your love and make you fall for us,

826
01:08:12,666 --> 01:08:13,666
what do you girls do?

827
01:08:14,458 --> 01:08:16,083
Daddy asked to meet you once,

828
01:08:16,582 --> 01:08:21,957
Hey dear... darling... you will convince
my parents for our marriage, right?

829
01:08:23,125 --> 01:08:27,207
You would introduce us very simply
to your parents saying so

830
01:08:28,416 --> 01:08:29,125
Damn on that fellow!

831
01:08:29,916 --> 01:08:32,916
He too will simply say
you are not correct for our daughter

832
01:08:33,582 --> 01:08:35,625
and says not get her married to an useless guy like you

833
01:08:36,416 --> 01:08:38,291
We became useless for you, right?

834
01:08:40,166 --> 01:08:47,041
If all our boys mind their own studies and continue the jobs,
all you girls will die suffering without having any boy to love

835
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:51,833
We should run behind for your love

836
01:08:53,125 --> 01:08:55,332
We should strive hard for making your parents agree

837
01:08:55,666 --> 01:09:00,041
If they do not agree by chance,
you adjust marrying some Tom, Dick and Harry

838
01:09:01,082 --> 01:09:02,500
And we get a shabby beard,

839
01:09:03,125 --> 01:09:07,082
a bottle in hands and a dirty dog moving beside us

840
01:09:08,582 --> 01:09:10,082
Such Devdas days are gone,

841
01:09:10,957 --> 01:09:11,665
I will drive them away

842
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:15,041
And you fell behind saying to have loved me

843
01:09:15,416 --> 01:09:17,416
Yes, even now I am saying the same

844
01:09:18,332 --> 01:09:21,915
I fell behind and I loved and I am saying no.

845
01:09:22,166 --> 01:09:23,041
What is your problem?

846
01:09:24,875 --> 01:09:27,416
You loved and you fell behind.

847
01:09:28,582 --> 01:09:29,207
That is it.. right?

848
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,041
You said a new logic mixing up love and business

849
01:09:35,041 --> 01:09:36,416
Thank you... Bye!

850
01:10:02,708 --> 01:10:03,375
Who are you idiots?

851
01:10:15,208 --> 01:10:16,040
Who are you sir?

852
01:10:16,375 --> 01:10:17,541
Give that briefcase

853
01:10:18,208 --> 01:10:22,708
Four old dresses, 3 vests and 2 briefs,
what will you do taking this briefcase sir?

854
01:10:23,083 --> 01:10:24,665
Oh no, jokes!

855
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,875
The briefcase which was in the car you brought

856
01:10:28,250 --> 01:10:29,291
I do not know about that sir

857
01:10:29,583 --> 01:10:31,290
Shall I waste another bullet for saying that?

858
01:10:31,708 --> 01:10:34,333
No need, I have to make a phone call sir

859
01:10:34,791 --> 01:10:35,708
Ok, go ahead

860
01:10:49,125 --> 01:10:51,708
I am trying for this fellow and he is trying for me...

861
01:10:52,375 --> 01:10:55,125
He is a big rascal and I should handle with great care.

862
01:10:57,541 --> 01:10:58,250
Hello

863
01:10:58,750 --> 01:11:00,333
Brother, this is Vara

864
01:11:00,666 --> 01:11:01,833
Yes, say brother

865
01:11:02,458 --> 01:11:05,458
Brother, that briefcase is with you right?

866
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:08,458
Yes, it is very safe with me.

867
01:11:08,750 --> 01:11:10,416
Say the address, where shall I bring it?

868
01:11:10,583 --> 01:11:14,540
Plot number 401, Krishna Residency, Nagarjuna Nagar

869
01:11:14,708 --> 01:11:15,415
Okay.

870
01:11:17,333 --> 01:11:22,208
You dirty rascal, you sell my two lakh bike for 20000?

871
01:11:22,875 --> 01:11:28,000
I am coming idiot, I will recover my bike
money even by selling parts from your body.

872
01:11:28,416 --> 01:11:29,166
I am coming

873
01:11:35,166 --> 01:11:36,291
Drink is finished..

874
01:11:38,416 --> 01:11:41,291
Only murder remains now. I am coming

875
01:11:46,333 --> 01:11:48,665
Looks like brother has come.
I will go and open the door

876
01:11:49,041 --> 01:11:50,583
Hey, do not overact.

877
01:11:51,416 --> 01:11:52,916
You both want to escape opening the door?

878
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:54,208
Hey...
Brother.

879
01:11:54,375 --> 01:11:55,000
Go and open the door

880
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:01,530
Do you sell my 2 Lakh bike for 20000, idiot

881
01:12:01,930 --> 01:12:03,799
Whose dad does it belong to to sell it

882
01:12:04,083 --> 01:12:08,714
Bring back my bike
Hey, leave me rascal

883
01:12:11,458 --> 01:12:14,375
Hey, you just hit without seeing
who it is once the door is opened rascal?

884
01:12:18,166 --> 01:12:19,041
Where is the briefcase?

885
01:12:19,541 --> 01:12:21,958
If he gives my bike, I will give you the briefcase

886
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:22,750
What bike?

887
01:12:23,583 --> 01:12:26,000
He sold my two lakh worth bike for just 20000

888
01:12:26,583 --> 01:12:28,500
You need the bike or life?

889
01:12:32,166 --> 01:12:33,458
I need my bike only

890
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:38,333
Hey, you give the briefcase or kill your brother?

891
01:12:39,666 --> 01:12:41,708
Brother, he would kill me.

892
01:12:42,375 --> 01:12:43,458
Give his briefcase to him

893
01:12:44,041 --> 01:12:45,541
Property of others is like a snake

894
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:47,666
Oh I see

895
01:12:49,708 --> 01:12:52,915
Hey, you give the briefcase or shall I finish both and take it

896
01:13:00,750 --> 01:13:03,541
Who is this guy sleeping blocking the door,
useless fellow

897
01:13:03,791 --> 01:13:04,750
Hey! He has not slept blocking it...

898
01:13:05,125 --> 01:13:06,708
You made me make him sleep horizontal,
who are you, idiot?

899
01:13:07,083 --> 01:13:07,750
Who are you rascal?

900
01:13:09,666 --> 01:13:12,083
Your fellow has to pay for Credit card and so I have come

901
01:13:12,625 --> 01:13:14,166
When will you give my money?

902
01:13:14,958 --> 01:13:16,125
Do not come near, I will kill this fellow

903
01:13:16,541 --> 01:13:20,291
Kill if you want to brother,
but kill after he says when he will pay the money

904
01:13:20,416 --> 01:13:22,708
Hey, how will you collect after he is killed, crazy idiot?

905
01:13:23,791 --> 01:13:24,666
Yes, then...

906
01:13:24,708 --> 01:13:26,540
Hey mental, do not come near. I will kill

907
01:13:26,791 --> 01:13:29,375
Hey, that in hands and what to get will be gone killing him.

908
01:13:30,333 --> 01:13:31,875
Yes idea... one minute...

909
01:13:32,250 --> 01:13:33,500
Hey, what are you putting hands in the pocket?

910
01:13:33,666 --> 01:13:34,875
Tell me if you have an idea brother

911
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,041
He should give you and also me, what will I...

912
01:13:46,166 --> 01:13:49,000
Hey, not knowing who is hitting whom.

913
01:13:49,166 --> 01:13:52,666
You can fight later, if you give my money I will leave

914
01:13:52,958 --> 01:13:54,708
I pray to you, no fighting please

915
01:14:17,875 --> 01:14:21,708
What is it, you could have shot
and why did you make me shoot?

916
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:26,666
No bro, punishment is the same
either you kill one or two, right brother?

917
01:14:27,333 --> 01:14:27,833
Come bro

918
01:14:28,208 --> 01:14:30,750
Oh no, you made me into a professional killer

919
01:14:34,666 --> 01:14:37,708
Looks like she is very much disappointed,
what shall we do now?

920
01:14:40,833 --> 01:14:43,790
She would get settled after a few days.

921
01:14:44,458 --> 01:14:46,083
Or else shall we get her married?

922
01:14:46,333 --> 01:14:48,875
Marriage? She is my daughter.

923
01:14:49,750 --> 01:14:52,666
She is not so lame to marry in haste
for such matters

924
01:14:53,375 --> 01:14:54,166
Give her time

925
01:14:54,625 --> 01:14:55,041
Daddy

926
01:14:55,875 --> 01:14:56,541
Yes baby

927
01:14:57,625 --> 01:14:59,500
My marriage should happen by the time you leave for US

928
01:15:01,041 --> 01:15:02,250
Ok, we shall do

929
01:15:02,958 --> 01:15:09,083
But, he gave an advice to get me married
looking out for a good match right?

930
01:15:10,333 --> 01:15:11,915
You should get me married in front of his eyes.

931
01:15:12,166 --> 01:15:14,958
Within one week, my marriage should take place

932
01:15:17,708 --> 01:15:18,750
She is small girl.

933
01:15:19,666 --> 01:15:24,250
and when asked to get her married in anger,
instead to convince her, why do you commit coolly?

934
01:15:25,541 --> 01:15:28,750
She is thinking to start a new life for forgetting her pain.

935
01:15:29,791 --> 01:15:30,666
Let us support her

936
01:15:36,333 --> 01:15:40,375
What, worrying as Suleiman was just caught and escaped?

937
01:15:41,333 --> 01:15:44,875
I know that Suleiman would attack on Supreeth, in advance

938
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:49,875
That is why I appointed a powerful
Police officer as undercover cop.

939
01:15:50,208 --> 01:15:50,915
This is him.

940
01:15:53,083 --> 01:15:54,875
So, we can leave this case.

941
01:15:55,375 --> 01:15:57,041
He can handle it. Ok?

942
01:15:57,708 --> 01:15:58,458
Ok sir

943
01:16:06,708 --> 01:16:07,750
We were tensed a lot sir.

944
01:16:08,291 --> 01:16:10,125
Why did you not say in advance
that he is a Police officer sir?

945
01:16:11,375 --> 01:16:12,458
He is not a Police officer

946
01:16:13,583 --> 01:16:15,083
What? Why not say that in front of all, then Sir?

947
01:16:15,416 --> 01:16:18,833
How did that Suleiman Khan get
to know of the matter which only we know?

948
01:16:19,791 --> 01:16:22,291
How could he attack on Supreeth for the briefcase?

949
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,500
Somebody from our Police is giving him information.

950
01:16:26,083 --> 01:16:28,208
Now he would get to know that this fellow is the Police

951
01:16:28,583 --> 01:16:31,665
By the time he knows that this fellow is not
a Police but the parking guy,

952
01:16:31,958 --> 01:16:33,958
we shall collect that briefcase from him

953
01:16:34,291 --> 01:16:34,708
Ok sir

954
01:16:36,125 --> 01:16:36,666
Who is this fellow?

955
01:16:36,916 --> 01:16:39,875
Even his finger prints were found
at the house of Supreeth sir

956
01:16:40,166 --> 01:16:42,083
He is a old criminal in a few petty cases

957
01:16:42,750 --> 01:16:43,875
Then, why is this fellow there that time?

958
01:16:44,041 --> 01:16:47,291
Sir, the software employee we appointed
has a habit of getting boys every day

959
01:16:47,541 --> 01:16:48,875
Similarly he may have booked this fellow...

960
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,375
Ok, I am giving you one week leave

961
01:16:52,958 --> 01:16:56,833
You go in mufti and bring the briefcase
from that parking guy in this one week

962
01:16:57,041 --> 01:16:58,208
Ok sir..
But be careful...

963
01:16:58,541 --> 01:17:01,416
None should know that we are on this job.

964
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:02,166
Ok?

965
01:17:02,333 --> 01:17:02,790
Ok sir

966
01:17:02,916 --> 01:17:03,916
All the best.
Bye.

967
01:17:14,166 --> 01:17:15,833
Why should I kill you so simply?

968
01:17:16,833 --> 01:17:20,165
Those mafia guys would chase and kill you for this briefcase

969
01:17:22,375 --> 01:17:24,958
They know you and your address too.

970
01:17:26,666 --> 01:17:28,250
They may kill even you, Gun Laden bro

971
01:17:28,333 --> 01:17:30,415
Me? Why will they kill me?

972
01:17:30,750 --> 01:17:31,791
They do not know who I am right?

973
01:17:32,916 --> 01:17:35,166
In the gap when you came to my room just before,

974
01:17:35,416 --> 01:17:39,041
I said about you to entertain them as
they were getting bored, Laden bro

975
01:17:39,375 --> 01:17:41,000
They called and said all that to their boss...

976
01:17:41,833 --> 01:17:42,708
Gun Laden bro...

977
01:17:49,333 --> 01:17:50,208
What shall we do now?

978
01:17:50,583 --> 01:17:53,415
We shall break that briefcase and see what is in that.
Gun laden bro

979
01:17:54,041 --> 01:17:57,708
Hey, do not repeatedly say Gun Laden.
I am getting frightened.

980
01:17:57,958 --> 01:17:59,790
I am a guy into small settlements.

981
01:17:59,916 --> 01:18:02,875
You say it so many times, I have
reached a stage of committing urders.

982
01:18:03,083 --> 01:18:07,083
I pray to you, see what is in that briefcase.
Come on see

983
01:18:07,833 --> 01:18:08,750
Oh!

984
01:18:13,625 --> 01:18:14,375
It will not come like this...

985
01:18:14,416 --> 01:18:16,500
Hey, down... Down...

986
01:18:29,666 --> 01:18:31,750
Damn, so many murders for this waste laptop?

987
01:18:33,958 --> 01:18:35,000
Brother, hold for a minute...

988
01:18:36,458 --> 01:18:36,915
Hello

989
01:18:37,125 --> 01:18:41,166
Look Vara, I know that you have the briefcase

990
01:18:42,791 --> 01:18:45,416
I will pay two crores if you give me that briefcase

991
01:18:46,208 --> 01:18:47,000
Two crores...

992
01:18:47,958 --> 01:18:49,540
Hello, say again

993
01:18:50,291 --> 01:18:53,250
I will give two crores if you give me that briefcase

994
01:18:55,208 --> 01:18:56,833
Hey talk... ask where...

995
01:18:57,250 --> 01:18:58,250
Ok, where shall we meet?

996
01:18:58,458 --> 01:19:01,333
Tomorrow morning 10:30 at Golconda fort

997
01:19:02,333 --> 01:19:04,500
Say ok...
Ok, deal ok

998
01:19:05,458 --> 01:19:06,375
Very good brother...

999
01:19:06,541 --> 01:19:08,708
Look 50-50

1000
01:19:08,750 --> 01:19:10,375
Ok but careful about the briefcase

1001
01:19:10,750 --> 01:19:14,000
I used to live on the small settlements
all these days and now in single shot...

1002
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:15,708
Let us party...

1003
01:19:23,666 --> 01:19:27,583
I do not know story of leaf and thorn

1004
01:19:29,625 --> 01:19:33,750
I do not know mummy daddy game

1005
01:19:35,750 --> 01:19:43,041
I do not know what to even
if finger is put in mouth

1006
01:19:43,750 --> 01:19:51,333
I do not know what I do even
if the slipping sari is caught

1007
01:19:51,750 --> 01:19:55,416
I do not know story of leaf and thorn

1008
01:19:57,708 --> 01:20:01,500
I do not know mummy daddy game

1009
01:20:03,708 --> 01:20:11,290
No idea what is in the gents and what ladies need

1010
01:20:11,708 --> 01:20:18,790
I am in the age to know that, will you say me hello

1011
01:20:19,791 --> 01:20:23,458
I do not know story of leaf and thorn

1012
01:20:25,750 --> 01:20:29,583
I do not know mummy daddy game

1013
01:20:49,625 --> 01:20:57,541
For the Swathi book tips, I waited the whole week

1014
01:20:57,750 --> 01:21:05,291
I hid all my age worrying for not getting a reply

1015
01:21:05,791 --> 01:21:12,958
Will anyone from all here clear that doubt of mine?

1016
01:21:13,750 --> 01:21:17,000
I do not know story of leaf and thorn

1017
01:21:19,750 --> 01:21:23,291
I do not know mummy daddy game

1018
01:21:43,708 --> 01:21:51,415
Jyotilaxmi said to inform what is liked as it is done

1019
01:21:51,791 --> 01:21:59,458
She came near and is saying the Newton law when I went

1020
01:21:59,750 --> 01:22:06,333
Say the meaning of that knowing it

1021
01:22:08,125 --> 01:22:11,416
I do not know story of leaf and thorn

1022
01:22:13,750 --> 01:22:17,041
I do not know mummy daddy game

1023
01:22:19,750 --> 01:22:27,291
I do not know what to even if finger is put in mouth

1024
01:22:27,750 --> 01:22:35,166
I do not know what I do even if the slipping sari is caught

1025
01:22:40,958 --> 01:22:41,958
Where is the briefcase dude?

1026
01:22:42,041 --> 01:22:43,750
There would be cases here, but no briefcases

1027
01:22:45,166 --> 01:22:46,666
Oh no, Police?

1028
01:22:46,791 --> 01:22:49,041
Who are you rascal? What do you think of my brother?

1029
01:22:49,291 --> 01:22:50,166
You manhandle my brother?

1030
01:22:50,416 --> 01:22:52,958
Why are you staying so cool bro?
I will do though you stay calm.

1031
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:53,708
What are you idiots?

1032
01:22:59,250 --> 01:23:00,166
Who are you sir?

1033
01:23:00,208 --> 01:23:02,458
He is asking right? Say

1034
01:23:02,541 --> 01:23:04,458
Our husbands, They are Police in mufti.

1035
01:23:05,125 --> 01:23:06,000
Police?
Yes

1036
01:23:06,166 --> 01:23:07,250
Where is the briefcase?

1037
01:23:08,250 --> 01:23:11,041
How sir, when you round up like that and ask?

1038
01:23:11,541 --> 01:23:14,500
If you give way, I will tell you where
the briefcase is in a cool way

1039
01:23:14,666 --> 01:23:16,708
Your work will be done, what Laden sir?

1040
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:17,958
We kept the briefcase outside sir.

1041
01:23:18,166 --> 01:23:19,583
They will not allow in the bar, right sir?

1042
01:23:19,791 --> 01:23:20,666
That is why...

1043
01:23:20,958 --> 01:23:21,833
Show...
Come sir

1044
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:22,458
Move

1045
01:23:23,041 --> 01:23:23,791
Run brother...

1046
01:23:24,791 --> 01:23:25,708
Hey, catch...

1047
01:23:33,625 --> 01:23:34,250
Hello Khan Saab

1048
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:35,958
Come on

1049
01:23:37,208 --> 01:23:38,208
Hey Police,

1050
01:23:39,166 --> 01:23:42,541
I understood that you do not
know how to do your duty well

1051
01:23:44,291 --> 01:23:45,125
You do one thing.

1052
01:23:46,083 --> 01:23:48,708
Move with my men for 10 days and you will improve a bit.

1053
01:23:52,041 --> 01:23:53,875
Now, there is no need for you to do anything.

1054
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:57,625
I spoke to that car parking Vara fellow.

1055
01:23:58,541 --> 01:24:02,291
My laptop will be in my hands by tomorrow morning 10:30

1056
01:24:03,250 --> 01:24:05,916
Now you go and sleep in the station.

1057
01:24:09,166 --> 01:24:13,250
Khan Saab, it is not that the laptop will be
in your hands by tomorrow morning 10:30

1058
01:24:14,083 --> 01:24:15,375
All of you will be in Charlapalli jail

1059
01:24:16,291 --> 01:24:16,916
What happened?

1060
01:24:17,125 --> 01:24:19,208
Who do you think is that car parking fellow?

1061
01:24:19,875 --> 01:24:23,208
He is the undercover cop appointed by
that Commissioner to arrest all of you

1062
01:24:24,333 --> 01:24:26,625
If you all go tomorrow to take the laptop,

1063
01:24:27,041 --> 01:24:28,333
he would arrest all of you and push into the cell

1064
01:24:29,625 --> 01:24:30,541
Understand at least now.

1065
01:24:31,333 --> 01:24:36,915
If I had not sincerely done duty at you,
it is not the den but you all will be in the cell. Ok?

1066
01:24:37,583 --> 01:24:38,875
All of this is the master plan of the Commissioner

1067
01:24:39,958 --> 01:24:43,665
Understood! I understood it all

1068
01:24:44,166 --> 01:24:46,958
If he has his plans, we will have our plans.

1069
01:24:47,750 --> 01:24:49,791
He will come tomorrow to arrest us right?

1070
01:24:50,666 --> 01:24:53,541
We shall kill him and get our laptop.

1071
01:24:54,416 --> 01:24:58,750
That Commissioner should shiver of this Khan with that

1072
01:24:59,583 --> 01:25:02,083
Anyway, you have done a good job

1073
01:25:03,666 --> 01:25:04,250
Keep it up

1074
01:25:09,708 --> 01:25:10,208
Oh no!

1075
01:25:19,166 --> 01:25:21,458
Hello
I am father of Julie

1076
01:25:22,458 --> 01:25:23,165
Uncle tell me

1077
01:25:23,541 --> 01:25:26,291
I mean, we are thinking of looking for matches to Julie

1078
01:25:26,958 --> 01:25:30,665
You kept a condition to look for
a good match and get her married right?

1079
01:25:31,250 --> 01:25:33,666
Thus I thought it would be better if you are here

1080
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:37,666
Ok uncle, either you or
I would think her to have a good future

1081
01:25:38,208 --> 01:25:40,125
We shall look for a good match
and get her married for sure

1082
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:41,083
Ok son

1083
01:25:41,416 --> 01:25:42,125
Ok uncle

1084
01:25:45,125 --> 01:25:45,666
Whom?

1085
01:25:46,083 --> 01:25:46,625
To Khan

1086
01:25:47,416 --> 01:25:50,083
Why to Khan? He said to come to Golconda tombs right?

1087
01:25:50,625 --> 01:25:51,875
You crazy bro,

1088
01:25:52,291 --> 01:25:55,541
we till now thought that only Khan was trying for the laptop

1089
01:25:55,958 --> 01:25:57,540
We came to know that even the Police are trying right?

1090
01:25:57,583 --> 01:25:59,250
Yes, so what?

1091
01:25:59,750 --> 01:26:00,958
What else bro,

1092
01:26:01,166 --> 01:26:05,250
when we know that this laptop is very important
for him why should we ask only 2 crores?

1093
01:26:05,583 --> 01:26:06,583
Why not ask for four crores?

1094
01:26:07,125 --> 01:26:11,250
You are super bro, call that Khan
and we shall give him a baby corn

1095
01:26:16,041 --> 01:26:17,375
That Police guy is calling

1096
01:26:17,750 --> 01:26:18,833
Switch on the speaker and talk

1097
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:21,500
Yes tell

1098
01:26:21,916 --> 01:26:25,375
Mr. Khan, I am not giving you the laptop at Golconda fort

1099
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,625
I said right that he will not give that laptop, talk

1100
01:26:30,791 --> 01:26:32,208
Why, have you changed the place?

1101
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:35,125
Not just place, but changed even rate and time

1102
01:26:35,791 --> 01:26:36,416
Why?

1103
01:26:36,666 --> 01:26:38,083
Pressure has gone high from the Police

1104
01:26:38,666 --> 01:26:40,625
Thus I hiked the briefcase rate to 4 crores.

1105
01:26:41,208 --> 01:26:43,083
4 Crores? It is difficult

1106
01:26:43,833 --> 01:26:45,750
I too know that it is tough for you to give right now.

1107
01:26:46,125 --> 01:26:48,500
Thus I will call you again after 4 days

1108
01:26:48,833 --> 01:26:49,540
Arrange for the money

1109
01:26:50,416 --> 01:26:52,333
Hello, hello...

1110
01:26:58,500 --> 01:27:00,583
What is this, what are you doing?

1111
01:27:00,625 --> 01:27:01,208
Hold this

1112
01:27:02,166 --> 01:27:03,083
Why are you taking out the SIM?

1113
01:27:04,583 --> 01:27:06,250
Did you not understand how the Police came to us?

1114
01:27:06,666 --> 01:27:07,666
They are tracing our phone.

1115
01:27:08,250 --> 01:27:10,250
Ok about the Police, but what to do if Khan calls us?

1116
01:27:10,625 --> 01:27:12,583
We gave time for four days right?
We will switch it on then

1117
01:27:13,583 --> 01:27:14,290
Where now?

1118
01:27:16,375 --> 01:27:17,458
To look for a match to my lover

1119
01:27:17,875 --> 01:27:20,791
What is you seeing matches for your lover?
Is your brain gone from the beating of the Police?

1120
01:27:21,541 --> 01:27:22,750
The matter is bro...

1121
01:27:28,666 --> 01:27:29,291
Understood?

1122
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,833
Anyone may have a retirement but not an ex-lover

1123
01:27:33,333 --> 01:27:35,415
He wishes her to be good till his last breathe

1124
01:27:36,958 --> 01:27:37,833
Understood bro, come we shall go

1125
01:27:41,458 --> 01:27:42,290
Look at this profile.

1126
01:27:42,916 --> 01:27:45,708
Horoscope of this boy has perfectly matched to our girl

1127
01:27:45,833 --> 01:27:47,125
Added the boy looks very handsome

1128
01:27:48,291 --> 01:27:49,416
What horoscopes even now?

1129
01:27:49,875 --> 01:27:50,416
Look here.

1130
01:27:50,958 --> 01:27:55,708
This boy is neurology specialist,
he suits correctly for our status

1131
01:27:56,625 --> 01:27:58,958
You say dear, who is best from both?

1132
01:28:00,625 --> 01:28:03,500
Your wish dad,

1133
01:28:04,750 --> 01:28:06,791
I lost confidence on my selection

1134
01:28:10,583 --> 01:28:12,833
I have no courage to go for another wrong match.

1135
01:28:17,250 --> 01:28:20,583
Whoever you select, I will happily get married

1136
01:28:23,125 --> 01:28:29,291
Vara, at least you say who fits best for Julie among the both?

1137
01:28:29,791 --> 01:28:30,500
You say dear,

1138
01:28:31,125 --> 01:28:33,125
how to look for matches without seeing the horoscopes?

1139
01:28:33,625 --> 01:28:37,833
I do not understand what these
two are talking with a laptop each in hands.

1140
01:28:37,958 --> 01:28:38,665
What is the matter?

1141
01:28:39,625 --> 01:28:40,666
Did not understand bro?
No

1142
01:28:41,833 --> 01:28:44,333
They are ordering a bridegroom online

1143
01:28:45,833 --> 01:28:48,458
You mean, we should not look for matches like this?

1144
01:28:49,541 --> 01:28:51,208
All are looking the same these days

1145
01:28:51,458 --> 01:28:53,540
We can see uncle in this computer...

1146
01:28:53,958 --> 01:29:00,750
Face of the boy, address,
what he does, his caste, religion...

1147
01:29:00,958 --> 01:29:01,750
All would be there uncle.

1148
01:29:02,583 --> 01:29:08,333
But what is he, what is his character
and do you know how his family is?

1149
01:29:09,833 --> 01:29:10,958
What you said is right aunty.

1150
01:29:11,375 --> 01:29:13,625
We can fix the timing if horoscopes match

1151
01:29:14,666 --> 01:29:16,583
You can do a rich marriage if your statuses get along.

1152
01:29:17,458 --> 01:29:21,458
But how is the boy,
will he take good care of your daughter...

1153
01:29:22,791 --> 01:29:25,333
Can you say how would our girl be at their house?

1154
01:29:25,875 --> 01:29:26,750
What can we do then?

1155
01:29:27,708 --> 01:29:28,540
We just have one week of time.

1156
01:29:29,291 --> 01:29:33,875
Still, they are not any bad matches,
they are all well settled people.

1157
01:29:34,083 --> 01:29:34,750
It is wrong uncle

1158
01:29:35,958 --> 01:29:36,958
It is the marriage of a girl uncle.

1159
01:29:38,041 --> 01:29:40,833
Every father thinks to have greatly brought up for 18 years,

1160
01:29:41,666 --> 01:29:43,041
looked out for a hundred matches

1161
01:29:44,208 --> 01:29:47,458
and got her married grandly with a well settled guy

1162
01:29:48,625 --> 01:29:51,333
and that their responsibility as a father is done uncle

1163
01:29:52,458 --> 01:29:53,625
That is not responsibility uncle.

1164
01:29:54,125 --> 01:30:00,291
We shall get her married in a good family
where she can forget the parents uncle

1165
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:09,458
What you said is all correct Vara,

1166
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:14,541
but I have a very few relatives.

1167
01:30:16,083 --> 01:30:19,915
We would not have run behind internet
and marriage bureaus like this if we had

1168
01:30:20,791 --> 01:30:24,541
I would have got her married
looking out for a good match in my relatives

1169
01:30:24,625 --> 01:30:25,916
You do not take any tension uncle,

1170
01:30:26,791 --> 01:30:29,791
I saw a boy last week and I will tell what I know about him

1171
01:30:30,250 --> 01:30:31,125
Look if you like him

1172
01:30:31,875 --> 01:30:33,875
Is it, who is that boy?

1173
01:30:34,333 --> 01:30:37,540
I beg you madam, looks like the girl may lose life

1174
01:30:37,583 --> 01:30:39,833
Have you sent samples to lab?
I sent sir

1175
01:30:39,916 --> 01:30:40,708
Sir
Say..

1176
01:30:40,750 --> 01:30:41,416
I pray to you sir,

1177
01:30:41,500 --> 01:30:43,000
looks like the girl may lose her life.

1178
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:44,583
At least you say Sir

1179
01:30:44,625 --> 01:30:46,125
We cannot do anything if you do not pay the money

1180
01:30:46,208 --> 01:30:48,125
You pay the money first
I beg you sir

1181
01:30:48,208 --> 01:30:49,083
Please, do not say anything else

1182
01:30:49,458 --> 01:30:51,250
Madam, please admit her

1183
01:30:52,416 --> 01:30:55,125
Sorry, I cannot do anything

1184
01:30:55,250 --> 01:30:56,375
Good morning sir
Good morning

1185
01:30:56,708 --> 01:30:57,500
What happened?

1186
01:30:57,958 --> 01:31:00,083
My girl might lose her life.

1187
01:31:00,541 --> 01:31:02,583
They are saying not to admit until I pay money.

1188
01:31:02,833 --> 01:31:03,833
Please tell them Sir

1189
01:31:03,875 --> 01:31:05,500
Lakshmi admit her,
We have no money sir

1190
01:31:05,666 --> 01:31:06,416
I will pay the money

1191
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:06,958
Ok sir

1192
01:31:07,375 --> 01:31:08,750
Nurse, take them to the ward

1193
01:31:09,166 --> 01:31:11,458
Please go madam, I will come and see
Thank you sir, be happy

1194
01:31:12,708 --> 01:31:14,790
That is all, he quit the job from that day uncle

1195
01:31:15,333 --> 01:31:19,415
He started his own hospital in his village
and is practicing medicine for free uncle

1196
01:31:20,125 --> 01:31:22,916
If you like that boy,
we shall get Julie married to him uncle

1197
01:31:24,458 --> 01:31:27,665
Everything is fine, but you say he is serving for free.

1198
01:31:27,958 --> 01:31:30,333
Whatever may be the property, how long would it last?

1199
01:31:31,458 --> 01:31:32,665
Maybe our girl will face trouble.

1200
01:31:34,291 --> 01:31:35,500
Saying daughter is your life,

1201
01:31:35,708 --> 01:31:39,583
in greed of few Dollars without
caring how she is here...

1202
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,500
He is very much better than you staying
there away abroad uncle

1203
01:31:43,041 --> 01:31:45,375
Doing so much for his village,

1204
01:31:45,666 --> 01:31:48,333
just think how much more care would
he take about his own wife uncle

1205
01:31:49,250 --> 01:31:50,916
Drink some more and think uncle

1206
01:31:51,333 --> 01:31:53,583
It is just one peg done now. Have another peg and think.

1207
01:31:54,208 --> 01:31:54,708
Come on..

1208
01:32:01,750 --> 01:32:02,416
Crazy meeting

1209
01:32:02,833 --> 01:32:03,290
Yes

1210
01:32:05,041 --> 01:32:06,750
Uncle, already may have told about me to you

1211
01:32:06,916 --> 01:32:08,916
Yes, daddy told me about you

1212
01:32:10,375 --> 01:32:11,291
You are looking good

1213
01:32:16,708 --> 01:32:17,333
See uncle,

1214
01:32:19,041 --> 01:32:20,291
how great did they suit...

1215
01:32:22,166 --> 01:32:23,625
Name of this is better than the food right?

1216
01:32:26,541 --> 01:32:26,958
Yes.

1217
01:32:33,958 --> 01:32:34,708
Go and wash it

1218
01:32:35,916 --> 01:32:37,708
Yes, excuse me!

1219
01:32:41,541 --> 01:32:42,000
Oh sorry

1220
01:32:42,125 --> 01:32:42,833
Many thanks

1221
01:32:44,875 --> 01:32:47,041
Not for saying sorry, but for dashing

1222
01:32:47,708 --> 01:32:49,915
Can I too say thanks?

1223
01:32:50,041 --> 01:32:51,791
You bloody rascals...

1224
01:32:51,875 --> 01:32:52,625
What are you saying idiots?

1225
01:32:52,708 --> 01:32:54,208
Hey
Hey, what?

1226
01:32:54,250 --> 01:32:55,208
Brother Please...

1227
01:32:55,500 --> 01:32:55,916
What idiot?

1228
01:32:56,500 --> 01:32:57,458
Brother..

1229
01:32:57,666 --> 01:32:59,250
I do not know what happened here

1230
01:32:59,625 --> 01:33:00,750
But confirmedly the mistake is ours.

1231
01:33:01,541 --> 01:33:03,583
Please bro, leave it. No fights, leave it bro please

1232
01:33:03,625 --> 01:33:05,375
Dad..
Hey, dirty idiots

1233
01:33:05,458 --> 01:33:05,915
Dad please

1234
01:33:06,083 --> 01:33:07,665
I will take care... I will talk sir

1235
01:33:07,958 --> 01:33:09,125
Messing with me...

1236
01:33:09,666 --> 01:33:10,375
Move on... move.

1237
01:33:11,750 --> 01:33:12,333
Go..

1238
01:33:12,375 --> 01:33:13,083
Uncle, you go...

1239
01:33:14,083 --> 01:33:15,625
Please bro, please... Thank you

1240
01:33:20,458 --> 01:33:21,415
Bye
Bye dear.

1241
01:33:23,083 --> 01:33:24,375
Uncle, you leave.

1242
01:33:24,625 --> 01:33:26,458
I just dropped my purse there at that fight.
I will go and get it.

1243
01:33:32,125 --> 01:33:35,541
Hey, say who just has done the mistake?

1244
01:33:36,041 --> 01:33:37,375
What? It is me, idiot.

1245
01:33:37,666 --> 01:33:38,333
What will you do?

1246
01:33:38,416 --> 01:33:39,083
What will you do, rascal?

1247
01:34:26,875 --> 01:34:27,583
What happened hubby?

1248
01:34:28,083 --> 01:34:30,500
I forgot spectacles inside and will just get them

1249
01:34:30,833 --> 01:34:31,250
Okay.

1250
01:34:57,916 --> 01:34:58,541
Let us go uncle

1251
01:35:02,916 --> 01:35:05,875
What man, did you still not forget my daughter?

1252
01:35:07,375 --> 01:35:09,291
He forgets anything if you give him money.

1253
01:35:10,125 --> 01:35:12,041
Did you keep anything in balance to him?

1254
01:35:12,750 --> 01:35:15,458
Come on remember, if not why will he remember?

1255
01:35:16,541 --> 01:35:17,875
Brother...
What brother?

1256
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:21,208
You are still safe even after roaming with me for so long,

1257
01:35:21,875 --> 01:35:24,166
you have come very close bro...
Oh no

1258
01:35:24,333 --> 01:35:26,125
Uncle is serving drink greatly

1259
01:35:26,708 --> 01:35:30,290
and I thought to give my feelings as the munching
and who needs your feelings in the middle?

1260
01:35:30,333 --> 01:35:31,875
Ok, ok!

1261
01:35:33,166 --> 01:35:35,875
Is your daughter any remembrance to forget, uncle?

1262
01:35:37,583 --> 01:35:38,583
She is my breathe uncle

1263
01:35:39,375 --> 01:35:40,083
Uncle...

1264
01:35:40,208 --> 01:35:43,583
Hey, take care... Be careful

1265
01:35:44,875 --> 01:35:45,416
Fine?

1266
01:35:47,833 --> 01:35:49,165
Like you just caught me,

1267
01:35:49,500 --> 01:35:57,166
it would have been good if someone caught me stopping
to make me fall in love when I first saw your daughter.

1268
01:35:57,666 --> 01:35:58,750
Be happy dear

1269
01:36:19,875 --> 01:36:24,041
I wished to take seven steps holding
that hand feeding people, uncle

1270
01:36:25,083 --> 01:36:26,208
But it is not possible in this life

1271
01:36:26,291 --> 01:36:27,708
Oh, very sad

1272
01:36:28,458 --> 01:36:29,458
One minute...

1273
01:36:31,750 --> 01:36:36,750
In the next life, I will not let go
my love how many ever crores you offer me

1274
01:36:37,958 --> 01:36:39,208
I will not let go...

1275
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:41,583
I will not...

1276
01:36:42,500 --> 01:36:45,416
I will not let go my Julie

1277
01:36:49,958 --> 01:36:50,415
Hello

1278
01:36:50,708 --> 01:36:52,040
Boss, this is Vara

1279
01:36:52,416 --> 01:36:53,000
Say

1280
01:36:53,416 --> 01:36:55,333
What, is the 4 crores deal ok?

1281
01:36:55,791 --> 01:36:58,416
Not 4, but will give 6.

1282
01:36:58,958 --> 01:37:00,290
I need that laptop

1283
01:37:00,750 --> 01:37:02,166
I am not so mean about money.

1284
01:37:02,958 --> 01:37:06,083
If I give word once, it is like very strong

1285
01:37:06,625 --> 01:37:07,750
But 6 is my sentiment.

1286
01:37:08,250 --> 01:37:09,750
You got my sentiment and hit me on that.

1287
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,041
Where shall I bring the money then?

1288
01:37:12,291 --> 01:37:13,333
I will come immediately.

1289
01:37:14,416 --> 01:37:20,125
You need cash or cheque or gold or the diamonds.

1290
01:37:20,416 --> 01:37:22,833
Tell me brother, I have everything.

1291
01:37:23,500 --> 01:37:24,250
No problem...

1292
01:37:24,333 --> 01:37:26,625
Wait Mr. Suleiman Khan.

1293
01:37:27,666 --> 01:37:30,916
My ego gets hurt if I give when you ask.

1294
01:37:31,333 --> 01:37:35,415
My ego satisfies if I give when I feel like giving.

1295
01:37:35,625 --> 01:37:39,666
Is that it or your ego gets satisfied
if I beg falling on your feet, rascal?

1296
01:37:40,166 --> 01:37:42,041
Huh, why did the voice change bro?

1297
01:37:42,291 --> 01:37:43,750
Even the ball position has changed idiot

1298
01:37:44,166 --> 01:37:47,666
You are now in my court. Just turn back once and see

1299
01:37:50,083 --> 01:37:52,833
Hey, men of Suleiman Khan.

1300
01:37:53,125 --> 01:37:54,416
You asked them to come tomorrow,
why did they come now?

1301
01:37:54,458 --> 01:37:57,083
Did you still not understand bro,
they want to hit us for free

1302
01:37:57,583 --> 01:37:58,333
What shall we do now?

1303
01:37:58,375 --> 01:38:00,208
What else, just escape

1304
01:38:00,416 --> 01:38:01,750
Escape... Oh no!

1305
01:38:01,916 --> 01:38:02,625
Catch them

1306
01:38:20,458 --> 01:38:21,165
Oh no!

1307
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:23,416
How long will they follow us this way?

1308
01:38:26,333 --> 01:38:27,000
Idea!

1309
01:38:27,333 --> 01:38:28,665
Hello brother..are you fine?
Hello, thank you

1310
01:38:35,125 --> 01:38:37,166
Have you seen a guy running this way?

1311
01:38:37,291 --> 01:38:38,041
How would he be?

1312
01:38:38,166 --> 01:38:41,166
He would be shabby, dirty and
very ugly like a monkey

1313
01:38:41,541 --> 01:38:42,875
Is my face like a monkey?
You rascal?

1314
01:38:42,958 --> 01:38:44,125
Hey, he is here. Come guys...
You bloody..

1315
01:38:47,083 --> 01:38:47,915
Oh no..!

1316
01:38:48,958 --> 01:38:49,708
You go that way...

1317
01:39:18,625 --> 01:39:19,708
Where will you go, idiot?

1318
01:39:20,666 --> 01:39:23,125
Hey, look back once and see your brother

1319
01:39:24,416 --> 01:39:26,833
I will kill your brother if you do not give me the laptop.

1320
01:39:27,166 --> 01:39:29,541
Brother, do not have anything mind bro...

1321
01:39:29,916 --> 01:39:33,041
I said 50-50 right? You take 80 and give me just 20.

1322
01:39:33,416 --> 01:39:34,458
Money of others is dangerous.

1323
01:39:34,708 --> 01:39:36,665
Brother, you are not understanding one thing in tension.

1324
01:39:36,708 --> 01:39:37,165
What?

1325
01:39:37,250 --> 01:39:38,416
100% is mine if you die.

1326
01:39:39,375 --> 01:39:40,708
All the best bro, all the best

1327
01:39:40,833 --> 01:39:41,750
Brother

1328
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,208
Are you playing drama idiots?

1329
01:39:45,333 --> 01:39:48,665
Brother, do not look so angry.
I am getting frightened.

1330
01:39:49,500 --> 01:39:52,958
When your brother does not need you,
why do we need you?

1331
01:39:54,208 --> 01:39:59,125
Still, anybody knowing about us
in this world should not be alive

1332
01:40:02,875 --> 01:40:05,458
It seems he is coming along with some Police

1333
01:40:05,666 --> 01:40:07,083
Not even one from us should be caught

1334
01:40:08,250 --> 01:40:09,041
Hey..stop.

1335
01:40:09,125 --> 01:40:10,000
Hey, escape...

1336
01:40:10,458 --> 01:40:11,290
Brother, run

1337
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:13,916
Oh no,

1338
01:40:15,291 --> 01:40:16,500
who are you sir holding me so strong?

1339
01:40:16,583 --> 01:40:17,540
I am Police

1340
01:40:17,666 --> 01:40:18,833
Police?
Yes

1341
01:40:19,083 --> 01:40:20,958
Sir, catch the same sir. I will give you money.

1342
01:40:21,250 --> 01:40:22,166
I am sincere Police

1343
01:40:22,208 --> 01:40:24,290
Oh sincere Police? You do not take money?

1344
01:40:24,416 --> 01:40:25,416
Than catch for free

1345
01:40:26,291 --> 01:40:28,375
He is... He is that type right?

1346
01:40:28,666 --> 01:40:29,916
Damn it, I am not like that

1347
01:40:30,083 --> 01:40:32,083
Not like that? Then look there once

1348
01:40:32,333 --> 01:40:33,165
Who is out there?

1349
01:40:33,833 --> 01:40:34,665
Bye...

1350
01:40:35,333 --> 01:40:38,958
Hey, stop... Hey Auto...

1351
01:40:52,125 --> 01:40:52,833
Thanks brother,

1352
01:40:53,416 --> 01:40:54,333
you saved me coming in time.

1353
01:40:54,875 --> 01:40:55,708
I cannot forget your help.

1354
01:40:55,750 --> 01:40:56,875
What, have they not killed you?

1355
01:40:57,500 --> 01:41:00,250
What is it? Have you not come to save me?

1356
01:41:00,583 --> 01:41:03,250
My foot! Police came opposite when I was running away.

1357
01:41:03,791 --> 01:41:05,375
I came back seeing them.

1358
01:41:05,833 --> 01:41:08,583
But these idiots thought that
I brought the Police and escaped.

1359
01:41:08,708 --> 01:41:09,665
Oh idiot,

1360
01:41:10,250 --> 01:41:14,083
believing in you is like playing
a 20-20 match with god of death as the umpire.

1361
01:41:14,750 --> 01:41:16,791
I am dehydrated a lot running, give me that water

1362
01:41:16,958 --> 01:41:17,415
Have it

1363
01:41:17,458 --> 01:41:21,833
Brother, how did he know that we were there at
Necklace road railway station?

1364
01:41:22,416 --> 01:41:23,583
Do not look me in such a doubt.

1365
01:41:23,958 --> 01:41:26,208
I escaped alive very marginally touching the death.

1366
01:41:28,750 --> 01:41:29,958
Your attention please...

1367
01:41:34,875 --> 01:41:35,958
You heard the announcement right?

1368
01:41:37,625 --> 01:41:38,958
See, I will give him a shocker now bro

1369
01:41:46,583 --> 01:41:47,040
Hello...

1370
01:41:47,125 --> 01:41:50,250
Hey, just listen only to what I am saying,
do not use your dirty brain

1371
01:41:51,625 --> 01:41:52,791
I will not give time now.

1372
01:41:53,208 --> 01:41:55,708
You should wait in tension thinking of when I would call

1373
01:41:55,791 --> 01:41:57,000
and this is the punishment I am giving you

1374
01:41:57,458 --> 01:41:58,458
Hello... Hello

1375
01:42:00,083 --> 01:42:04,500
When I am warning everyone, why is this fellow
giving me warnings?

1376
01:42:04,875 --> 01:42:06,375
Damn it, you stupid fellows!

1377
01:42:07,625 --> 01:42:08,958
It is all because of you.

1378
01:42:09,791 --> 01:42:14,250
When I said kill him and bring the laptop,
you came back like fools with empty hands

1379
01:42:15,416 --> 01:42:18,000
Go, arrange 6 crores in a bag and keep it ready

1380
01:42:18,916 --> 01:42:20,833
Let us wait for the call from Sir

1381
01:42:21,666 --> 01:42:22,833
Where are you rascal?

1382
01:42:26,708 --> 01:42:27,708
Is everything there, priest sir?

1383
01:42:27,750 --> 01:42:30,500
Not coconuts madam, bring raw ones.

1384
01:42:30,708 --> 01:42:31,583
Son Vara
Yes aunty

1385
01:42:31,625 --> 01:42:33,666
Priest sir is calling, come here once
Yes aunty

1386
01:42:34,916 --> 01:42:35,375
Here...

1387
01:42:35,458 --> 01:42:36,540
It seems they need raw coconuts

1388
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:37,875
Brother, come here bro

1389
01:42:39,875 --> 01:42:40,958
Come bro
What?

1390
01:42:41,083 --> 01:42:42,125
Go and bring raw coconuts

1391
01:42:42,166 --> 01:42:42,625
Me?

1392
01:42:43,583 --> 01:42:46,040
I did not ask you to clean tea cups.
I said to bring raw coconuts

1393
01:42:47,083 --> 01:42:48,833
Go brother
It is your time dude

1394
01:42:49,500 --> 01:42:49,916
Okay.

1395
01:42:50,375 --> 01:42:51,416
Aunty, they have come

1396
01:42:52,583 --> 01:42:54,540
Come, come brother

1397
01:42:55,041 --> 01:42:55,500
Come.

1398
01:42:55,541 --> 01:42:56,166
Hello
Hello

1399
01:42:57,500 --> 01:42:58,375
Hello..
Hi.

1400
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:00,416
Hello

1401
01:43:06,625 --> 01:43:07,500
Where is brother in law?

1402
01:43:07,625 --> 01:43:09,791
When do Doctors and Police have a tome, brother?

1403
01:43:10,166 --> 01:43:13,333
He went out in a hurry as he got an urgent call.
He will come by the time fixed

1404
01:43:13,500 --> 01:43:15,458
Madam, bring the new clothes

1405
01:43:15,500 --> 01:43:16,916
Vara, they are up in the bedroom.

1406
01:43:16,958 --> 01:43:17,833
Ok aunty
Go and bring

1407
01:43:28,916 --> 01:43:30,041
Looks like you are very happy

1408
01:43:31,416 --> 01:43:36,958
What more can be the happiness for an ex-lover
than to get his beloved married to a good match?

1409
01:43:39,625 --> 01:43:41,416
You are talking very nicely Vara

1410
01:43:43,041 --> 01:43:44,625
Even that day you spoke something great.

1411
01:43:45,875 --> 01:43:46,375
What did you say?

1412
01:43:47,291 --> 01:43:48,666
You said boys are great in love

1413
01:43:49,875 --> 01:43:53,625
and girls play with you in love
and you spoke something all

1414
01:43:55,541 --> 01:43:56,916
What do you guys know about us?

1415
01:44:00,250 --> 01:44:01,875
Ours is a very small world

1416
01:44:03,375 --> 01:44:08,375
Mom, dad, brother and
relatives who often visit our house

1417
01:44:09,458 --> 01:44:14,875
All do say a girl should not be like this or like that

1418
01:44:17,041 --> 01:44:21,583
Should not closely speak to all, should not behave freely

1419
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:27,083
Whatever we do, should be within the limits of a girl

1420
01:44:29,375 --> 01:44:34,000
For a girl growing in such a small world
amongst so many traditions

1421
01:44:35,875 --> 01:44:40,583
to say with a boy to like him itself is very great

1422
01:44:43,625 --> 01:44:45,666
What more shall we do for you boys?

1423
01:44:47,666 --> 01:44:48,500
What did you say then?

1424
01:44:49,833 --> 01:44:54,625
You said to have loved and then not
and what was my problem right?

1425
01:44:57,041 --> 01:44:58,708
My engagement is in an hour.

1426
01:45:00,666 --> 01:45:02,041
I will now be owned by some other person

1427
01:45:03,833 --> 01:45:05,040
Listen, I am saying now.

1428
01:45:07,875 --> 01:45:09,833
What you rejected was not your love

1429
01:45:12,125 --> 01:45:14,666
My love, loving more than your love

1430
01:45:17,583 --> 01:45:18,540
You did not understand right?

1431
01:45:21,333 --> 01:45:23,415
You are loving me just from one year

1432
01:45:24,625 --> 01:45:27,583
But I am loving you from two years

1433
01:45:29,416 --> 01:45:30,625
You still did not understand, right?

1434
01:45:41,875 --> 01:45:45,416
How much more I loved you than you from two years,

1435
01:45:46,500 --> 01:45:47,666
here are my remembrances for that

1436
01:45:48,958 --> 01:45:52,040
Sorry, proofs of that for you

1437
01:45:54,541 --> 01:45:55,750
Get lost from my life

1438
01:46:31,375 --> 01:46:32,083
Happy New Year

1439
01:46:32,500 --> 01:46:33,208
Thank you

1440
01:46:33,666 --> 01:46:34,541
Happy New Year

1441
01:46:35,875 --> 01:46:39,708
Anybody would give flowers or cards for
New Year and why did you give a diary?

1442
01:46:40,791 --> 01:46:42,458
Still, I do not have the habit of writing a diary.

1443
01:46:42,708 --> 01:46:45,915
You will throw flowers in a dustbin
and put the card in a cupboard

1444
01:46:46,166 --> 01:46:49,000
And if I give you a diary, it daily travels with you right?

1445
01:46:49,791 --> 01:46:55,000
My foot, another year turns up by the time
I finish the first page in this

1446
01:46:57,958 --> 01:47:00,790
Please, please give... Please

1447
01:48:37,666 --> 01:48:42,750
The eyes waiting for you will never get tired

1448
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:46,750
My heart flew after seeing you

1449
01:48:48,333 --> 01:48:53,540
The thought filled with you fought with me daily

1450
01:48:53,708 --> 01:48:58,250
My sleep got disturbed day and night

1451
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:09,375
Some pain in the heart hurt me, maybe because of you

1452
01:49:09,666 --> 01:49:19,583
I have driven away me from myself
and I searched for me in you

1453
01:49:20,208 --> 01:49:30,625
I wiped away feeling of myself and I moved like you

1454
01:49:30,958 --> 01:49:36,875
Thinking that you would look at me some time

1455
01:50:11,250 --> 01:50:20,916
These letters of looks written by my eyes
Have still not reached you

1456
01:50:21,541 --> 01:50:26,875
I hid words and sent message through clouds

1457
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:33,708
I spread all my love before you seeing from a side

1458
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:47,958
The eyes waiting for you will never get tired

1459
01:50:48,333 --> 01:50:52,375
My heart flew after seeing you

1460
01:50:53,708 --> 01:50:58,625
The thought filled with you fought with me daily

1461
01:50:59,083 --> 01:51:03,333
My sleep got disturbed day and night

1462
01:51:31,166 --> 01:51:40,583
My heart marching towards
you is not listening to me

1463
01:51:41,666 --> 01:51:46,791
No idea what magic you threw in the air

1464
01:51:47,041 --> 01:51:53,833
You threw a trap and snatched my heart

1465
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:07,916
The eyes waiting for you will never get tired

1466
01:52:08,333 --> 01:52:12,208
My heart flew after seeing you

1467
01:52:13,708 --> 01:52:23,415
The thought filled with you fought with me daily
My sleep got disturbed day and night

1468
01:52:52,625 --> 01:52:53,875
Uncle, what happened uncle?

1469
01:52:54,625 --> 01:52:56,541
Bro, where did all these go?

1470
01:52:56,875 --> 01:52:58,583
What exactly is happening in this house?

1471
01:52:59,500 --> 01:53:05,041
She says marriage should take place before
you irrespective of whoever is the groom

1472
01:53:05,625 --> 01:53:09,208
You would say to look for a good match
and get the marriage done

1473
01:53:09,958 --> 01:53:13,165
Not able to understand what is running in between you,

1474
01:53:13,833 --> 01:53:16,540
I am not getting clarity though
I am drinking a full bottle everyday

1475
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,875
Sir, I have been roaming with him from
so many days and did not understand him.

1476
01:53:19,958 --> 01:53:20,915
What can you understand him sir?

1477
01:53:21,791 --> 01:53:24,166
Leave it daddy, I said you right then

1478
01:53:24,583 --> 01:53:25,665
You wait for a minute dear

1479
01:53:27,083 --> 01:53:31,583
In these days leaving own parents in
orphanages feeling them as a burden,

1480
01:53:32,416 --> 01:53:40,583
you are safeguarding your mother means,
you will definitely be a good guy

1481
01:53:43,416 --> 01:53:49,083
Then why did you let go my daughter whom
you loved so much, for money?

1482
01:53:53,250 --> 01:53:55,916
I am just coming after operating your mother.

1483
01:54:23,208 --> 01:54:25,915
Inject again at 5 in the evening
Ok Doctor

1484
01:54:37,500 --> 01:54:38,458
What exactly happened?

1485
01:54:42,333 --> 01:54:46,750
That day, my dad died on the spot in the accident

1486
01:54:56,166 --> 01:54:59,541
Son, you do not have an age to understand
what I am saying.

1487
01:55:00,416 --> 01:55:02,208
But, what I am saying is true

1488
01:55:03,166 --> 01:55:06,000
We can now operate and save your mother,

1489
01:55:07,083 --> 01:55:08,708
it needs a lot of money

1490
01:55:09,375 --> 01:55:11,666
But still, your mom cannot do anything for you.

1491
01:55:12,291 --> 01:55:15,875
That means mom cannot feed you,
she cannot make you play

1492
01:55:16,666 --> 01:55:18,291
and cannot even take you to school

1493
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:24,000
Mom cannot do anything because
whole future of mom is now on the bed

1494
01:55:25,291 --> 01:55:28,708
You have a big bungalow, car and properties.

1495
01:55:29,416 --> 01:55:32,875
All those will be of use to your future, understand son

1496
01:55:34,208 --> 01:55:36,500
We will think that this operation has failed

1497
01:55:37,833 --> 01:55:44,875
Uncle, I do not need big bungalow, cars
and not even the properties.

1498
01:55:45,250 --> 01:55:50,000
You take it all and give me my mother, uncle

1499
01:55:54,208 --> 01:55:56,000
I let go so many for my mom uncle

1500
01:55:58,708 --> 01:56:03,540
I got a call from the hospital
one day after some years

1501
01:56:07,208 --> 01:56:07,625
Mom...

1502
01:56:17,541 --> 01:56:19,458
I am your Vara mom

1503
01:56:39,250 --> 01:56:43,541
My mom came out from coma after some years

1504
01:56:44,708 --> 01:56:48,665
She could not recognize her own son
and looked at me like a stranger

1505
01:56:49,458 --> 01:56:52,750
For my mom to recognize me,
they said a Doctor would come from abroad

1506
01:56:53,583 --> 01:56:56,750
and asked me to arrange ten lakhs
for her brain surgery

1507
01:57:07,708 --> 01:57:12,083
On that day when I met you for the first time,
situation of you and me was the same uncle

1508
01:57:13,708 --> 01:57:17,375
You thought of giving anything for
the future of your daughter

1509
01:57:20,291 --> 01:57:23,416
I thought to let go of anything
for the love of my mom

1510
01:57:25,916 --> 01:57:29,125
I did the same calculation for your love
and the love of my mom, uncle

1511
01:57:30,916 --> 01:57:31,708
That is what has happened

1512
01:57:34,166 --> 01:57:35,000
Good choice dear

1513
01:57:45,041 --> 01:57:45,708
Love you dear...

1514
01:57:51,458 --> 01:57:53,290
Your mom will recognize you, go...

1515
01:59:06,291 --> 01:59:09,916
Excuse me, do not disturb the patient.
Go and wait outside

1516
01:59:22,958 --> 01:59:25,125
Vara, you do not take any tension about money.

1517
01:59:25,625 --> 01:59:26,958
Daddy will now take care of everything

1518
01:59:27,208 --> 01:59:30,333
No need, we will have so much money if we give this off

1519
01:59:31,583 --> 01:59:33,915
Is it? What is there in that?

1520
01:59:34,333 --> 01:59:36,750
There is a laptop in this.

1521
01:59:37,166 --> 01:59:39,791
Police and Suleiman Khan are chasing for this.

1522
01:59:39,916 --> 01:59:44,041
Police wants to get this for free and
Suleiman Khan will give six crores if this is given to him

1523
01:59:44,291 --> 01:59:45,416
He will get three and I will get three

1524
01:59:46,541 --> 01:59:49,000
All of this sounds like some crime.

1525
01:59:50,166 --> 01:59:52,125
No risk needed Vara, hand it off to the Police

1526
01:59:52,583 --> 01:59:53,333
To the Police?

1527
02:00:00,500 --> 02:00:02,958
Thank you Vara, you helped a lot giving that laptop to us

1528
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:04,416
It is my responsibility sir.

1529
02:00:05,125 --> 02:00:07,541
Sir, this password is not being hacked by us.

1530
02:00:08,166 --> 02:00:09,750
Data will crash if we try further

1531
02:00:10,125 --> 02:00:12,583
Sir, I have an idea to open this

1532
02:00:12,750 --> 02:00:13,291
What is that?

1533
02:00:13,750 --> 02:00:17,541
He would be waiting for my call.
I will take this laptop and you come then

1534
02:00:17,958 --> 02:00:18,500
Ok Vara

1535
02:00:20,958 --> 02:00:25,708
We became fools thinking that after all
a car driver is a police

1536
02:00:26,458 --> 02:00:29,540
No, you made us into fools

1537
02:00:29,875 --> 02:00:32,375
Sorry sir, I too just came to know about the matter

1538
02:00:32,875 --> 02:00:35,333
That is why I came to you skipping
from going to the conference

1539
02:00:35,958 --> 02:00:37,790
Will you get to know everything just before a second?

1540
02:00:38,666 --> 02:00:42,375
No worries, he called himself to come in greed of money.

1541
02:00:43,333 --> 02:00:44,125
Let him come

1542
02:00:46,375 --> 02:00:47,708
Why did he still not come?

1543
02:00:56,166 --> 02:00:58,416
Welcome Vara, welcome

1544
02:00:59,625 --> 02:01:02,583
Listening to your talk on phone
I thought you were notorious

1545
02:01:02,958 --> 02:01:07,915
But getting my briefcase as per
what you said, became a hero

1546
02:01:08,833 --> 02:01:10,915
What dude, I said correct right?
You said it right bro

1547
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:15,333
Bro, listening to your voice on phone
I felt you would be like the villain from Gabbar Singh

1548
02:01:16,375 --> 02:01:17,916
But no problem, you look smart

1549
02:01:18,166 --> 02:01:21,083
Are you making fun with me doing crime?

1550
02:01:21,750 --> 02:01:22,541
Briefcase!

1551
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:28,500
Brother, we can not believe this fellow.

1552
02:01:28,750 --> 02:01:29,750
Check the data once

1553
02:01:30,125 --> 02:01:30,833
True dude...

1554
02:01:36,208 --> 02:01:38,415
Brother, I gave your laptop to you.

1555
02:01:39,541 --> 02:01:40,250
You are happy right?

1556
02:01:41,541 --> 02:01:43,375
I am happy, full happy!

1557
02:01:44,916 --> 02:01:47,541
Brother, I will leave if you give my six crores

1558
02:01:47,875 --> 02:01:51,875
Brother, you became a hero standing on
your word and bringing the laptop.

1559
02:01:52,125 --> 02:01:56,041
But I am not a hero like you to stand on my word,
but a villain

1560
02:01:56,500 --> 02:01:57,458
A bad villain!

1561
02:02:00,750 --> 02:02:03,041
No one who knows about me should be alive

1562
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,250
Bro, then kill them first.

1563
02:02:08,916 --> 02:02:10,125
You are finished now idiot

1564
02:02:10,625 --> 02:02:12,125
Think of your favorite God!

1565
02:02:34,958 --> 02:02:36,500
Come on, it is wrong. Keep it inside.

1566
02:02:36,750 --> 02:02:37,916
Who are you rascal?

1567
02:02:38,625 --> 02:02:40,958
Who is this fellow asking for
my introduction when the story is coming to climax?

1568
02:02:41,125 --> 02:02:43,291
Khan... Suleiman Khan...

1569
02:02:43,666 --> 02:02:45,125
Oh, is it you?

1570
02:02:45,625 --> 02:02:47,166
You are looking good with a clean shaven head

1571
02:02:47,583 --> 02:02:51,333
You all are saying smart...
do you think I am any item girl idiots?

1572
02:02:51,458 --> 02:02:52,540
You...

1573
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:54,708
I will count to three, leave my brother

1574
02:02:54,791 --> 02:02:56,166
What will you do if we do not leave?

1575
02:02:56,291 --> 02:02:58,375
Hey, you grew the body but why not the brain?

1576
02:02:58,500 --> 02:02:59,541
I will count three again

1577
02:03:00,041 --> 02:03:02,625
If I do not leave even then, will you count three more?

1578
02:03:02,791 --> 02:03:04,833
Hey, I do not know the numbers above that.

1579
02:03:05,041 --> 02:03:06,250
Please understand guys...

1580
02:03:07,333 --> 02:03:09,458
Huh, this gun gives a miss at the correct time...
Hey, catch that fellow

1581
02:03:29,083 --> 02:03:30,415
Brother, why did you come here?

1582
02:03:31,333 --> 02:03:34,500
We thought to share if we get the cash
and will I not share when you get a trouble brother?

1583
02:03:34,708 --> 02:03:35,958
You are super brother

1585

Mother is the first relation giving a shape sharing
her blood and flesh to the soul sent by the God

1593
02:04:19,083 --> 02:04:24,759
She makes us stand as humans
explaining the greatness of bonding

1594
02:04:24,960 --> 02:04:31,255
None can ever find a measurement
for the greatness of that mother

1595
02:04:31,455 --> 02:04:36,778
What we can do is to take great care of her
till the last breathe

1596
02:04:37,041 --> 02:04:40,791
Our film is dedicated to everyone who are that way
