1
00:03:16,409 --> 00:03:20,539
Anil, Anil, Anil...

2
00:03:27,454 --> 00:03:30,355
What are you looking at?
Lower your sari -Why?

3
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:34,123
Because this is a public place,
and people are looking at you.

4
00:03:34,194 --> 00:03:39,427
It will get dirty due to the wave
- Tomorrow I'll buy you 12 more

5
00:03:39,499 --> 00:03:46,268
But nobody has the right to see
these beautiful legs except me

6
00:03:53,747 --> 00:03:59,344
Do you love me so much? - No,
I'm such a jealous person that...

7
00:03:59,419 --> 00:04:04,322
...although there may be many
Shobhas, you are only mine.

8
00:04:07,193 --> 00:04:10,094
Why did you come late today?
- Overtime in the office

9
00:04:10,163 --> 00:04:14,099
This is a temporary phase, then
you will be married to me.

10
00:04:14,568 --> 00:04:18,504
And remain the Shobha [beauty]
Of my house too.

11
00:04:19,573 --> 00:04:25,773
See the sunset for which you
come here-Not to see it, but...

12
00:04:25,845 --> 00:04:31,078
...I come here to see U, you look
even more splendid at this time.

13
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:42,151
Let's have coffee, -Not today,
this morning Mother...

14
00:04:42,228 --> 00:04:46,722
...was ill so I'll go home.
- Ok, as you say.

15
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:08,182
You have come alone, today?
- Yes, Shobha had some work...

16
00:05:08,254 --> 00:05:11,018
...at home, so she left, will
you have coffee? - No.

17
00:05:11,091 --> 00:05:17,257
Brother, loving someone is
different but the status of...

18
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:19,457
...the person should be the same
when we marry him or her.

19
00:05:19,532 --> 00:05:23,798
Love is not bounded by this
status, or any other thing...

20
00:05:24,037 --> 00:05:29,031
...and by the way you are quite
young for this subject!

21
00:05:29,109 --> 00:05:32,806
Is that so? Mr...

22
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:41,853
Who are you? - He is Rakesh
and this is my elder brother.

23
00:05:44,457 --> 00:05:47,392
And you are... - He is my
boyfriend. Right now he's being...

24
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:50,224
...tested. But he'll be my husband
if we get along well.

25
00:05:50,296 --> 00:05:57,202
What does he do? - He is an
engineer-Then may God protect...

26
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:00,671
...you, as you'll regret the
decision for the rest of your life.

27
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:04,608
Because you will have to dance
around her day and night.

28
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:30,358
Any more orders? - The
secretary can't order his boss.

29
00:06:30,437 --> 00:06:34,771
Yes you can, just like your
father used to guide my...

30
00:06:34,841 --> 00:06:40,473
...father. I've always
regarded you as my...

31
00:06:40,547 --> 00:06:45,610
...elder brother. - Which means
that I have lost my job!

32
00:06:45,685 --> 00:06:50,486
Yes, from now on you'll be the
boss, till I return from...

33
00:06:50,557 --> 00:06:54,186
...Germany. Here, this is your
power of attorney.

34
00:06:57,130 --> 00:07:02,158
I have not told Shobha about
this, so could you call her &...

35
00:07:02,235 --> 00:07:08,333
...ask her to come to my place.
So that, she'll not fight.

36
00:07:08,408 --> 00:07:10,399
As you know her better.

37
00:07:14,814 --> 00:07:18,306
Mother, Anil is going abroad for
1 year & you never told me.

38
00:07:18,384 --> 00:07:23,219
Because you will be sad. -Which
means I won't be sad now?

39
00:07:23,289 --> 00:07:29,023
Yes, both of us will be sad but I
must go and learn there, about...

40
00:07:29,095 --> 00:07:35,466
...the plastic dye moulding, to
fulfil my fathers dreams.

41
00:07:35,535 --> 00:07:42,338
And time will go by. - So
why did you call me? - As you...

42
00:07:42,408 --> 00:07:48,142
...are expert in packing, come and
help me. - You know how...

43
00:07:48,214 --> 00:07:53,675
...careless he is, go and please
help him, so nothing is left out

44
00:08:23,016 --> 00:08:31,788
Are you angry? Did I do
something wrong?

45
00:08:32,025 --> 00:08:35,654
No. - Then what is the
matter with you?

46
00:08:38,331 --> 00:08:42,427
You are leaving and then you say
that time will pass away soon.

47
00:08:42,502 --> 00:08:45,630
Is that the only thing that's
bothering you?

48
00:08:51,444 --> 00:09:00,113
Leave me. - See Shobha, I'll write
to U every day and call weekly.

49
00:09:06,259 --> 00:09:12,095
Had you not been there in my
life, I could never go to Germany.

50
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:16,101
It's your love that I do every
thing, now please smile.

51
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,377
This tie and suit is of my
choice, wear to in every...

52
00:09:31,451 --> 00:09:37,117
...party, you look very handsome
in this. - Is it so? And what if...

53
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:44,289
...any girl flirts around with me?
- Then, she'll be more smarter...

54
00:09:44,364 --> 00:09:49,734
...than me. -You won't be jealous?
- Never, even if you get married...

55
00:09:49,802 --> 00:09:59,734
...to her. But I'll be
yours forever

56
00:11:08,114 --> 00:11:14,451
Don't forget me after you go
to the foreign land, dear.

57
00:11:28,601 --> 00:11:37,100
Don't forget that I've offered
you every thing that I possessed.

58
00:11:37,176 --> 00:11:46,448
Don't forget me, after you go to
the foreign land, dear.

59
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:46,445
Just for your happiness, I've
gone through a lot of pain.

60
00:12:52,785 --> 00:13:00,624
I have happily accepted that
we are parting.

61
00:13:05,698 --> 00:13:10,658
Don't forget me after you go
to the foreign land, dear.

62
00:13:50,810 --> 00:14:03,484
Your love is always on my heart
and it has been the reason of...

63
00:14:03,556 --> 00:14:09,222
...my disease, dear.

64
00:14:15,334 --> 00:14:21,671
I have taken the pain of
my entire life

65
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:16,421
Now we will see this sunset
after one year. -Why is that?

66
00:15:16,495 --> 00:15:21,762
You see it there, and I'll see it
here. - But, there is a time lag...

67
00:15:21,834 --> 00:15:27,067
...of five hours. - So what the
sun remains the same, isn't it?

68
00:15:27,139 --> 00:15:33,669
Yes that is so true, so...
- Stop it, do this after marriage.

69
00:15:33,746 --> 00:15:38,183
If everything is to be done after
marriage, then what's before it?

70
00:15:43,055 --> 00:15:47,492
How will I leave without you for
one year? -The same way like me

71
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:54,864
Do write to me every day. And
give me a promise -I do.

72
00:15:56,869 --> 00:16:00,134
I'll come back and marry you,
I'm giving...

73
00:16:05,211 --> 00:16:11,673
I'm giving the responsibility of
Vinny, Mom & my house to you

74
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:27,463
Your house is not only yours but
mine too. I'll take good care.

75
00:16:49,722 --> 00:16:55,285
I'll leave now as it is time.
Do write to me every day.

76
00:17:05,771 --> 00:17:13,371
What is this mother? Please
smile. - Son, you are going to...

77
00:17:13,446 --> 00:17:20,010
...fulfil your fathers dream, so
go and succeed in life.

78
00:17:22,088 --> 00:17:23,612
Take good care, of mom.

79
00:17:30,062 --> 00:17:34,294
Take good care and always
be happy son.

80
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:41,697
This is your passport, ticket, and
documents, have a nice flight.

81
00:17:59,191 --> 00:18:02,752
Anything else? - No, but wanted
your signature, there is a...

82
00:18:02,995 --> 00:18:06,089
...meeting tomorrow, of the board
of directors. - Tomorrow?

83
00:18:06,165 --> 00:18:10,727
You won't be living with me
today. -No, business first

84
00:18:14,106 --> 00:18:16,666
And there is my flight today,
so I'll be leaving as soon.

85
00:18:25,484 --> 00:18:31,423
Meet my brother R. K, he handles
all the business in Delhi. -Hello!

86
00:18:33,492 --> 00:18:34,584
Hello!

87
00:18:47,807 --> 00:18:53,768
Where are you lost? She is J. K's
secretary, Shobha -Bye brother.

88
00:19:03,088 --> 00:19:10,051
He is three years younger to me
and he is mesmerized like me...

89
00:19:10,129 --> 00:19:16,090
...after seeing you for first time.
- I wanted an off today

90
00:19:16,168 --> 00:19:22,539
But you had just come! - I've
some urgent personal work.

91
00:19:26,078 --> 00:19:33,041
Do you need some thing, some
kind of help, money or so?

92
00:19:33,118 --> 00:19:41,025
No, thank you. May I leave. -Wait
for a moment, I'd like to talk...

93
00:19:41,093 --> 00:19:43,323
...to you, please have a seat.

94
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:52,500
Shobha, you have been working
here for six months now

95
00:19:52,571 --> 00:19:56,735
I don't understand why you feel
strange to me, there are many...

96
00:19:56,809 --> 00:20:02,748
...girls in this office, who party
around with me. I feel that...

97
00:20:02,815 --> 00:20:15,523
...I should talk to you about this.
I'm an well established person...

98
00:20:15,594 --> 00:20:25,595
But still I'm alone. Everybody
dreams of a companion who'll...

99
00:20:25,671 --> 00:20:31,371
...always be there in good and
bad times. Who'll understand him.

100
00:21:01,273 --> 00:21:04,709
I'm proposing for the first time
to you today, will you?

101
00:21:08,647 --> 00:21:13,050
This is impossible. - Why?
- Because I love someone else...

102
00:21:13,118 --> 00:21:24,655
...we'll soon be getting married.
- You will get married, but have...

103
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:30,669
...not married as yet, no one
knows what will happen next...

104
00:21:30,736 --> 00:21:35,230
...some things are not meant to
happen, and some are not...

105
00:21:37,676 --> 00:21:47,142
Shobha, you know, I'm very
adamant on getting my way.

106
00:21:51,523 --> 00:21:55,118
Leave me. - You can't leave
this offer & go out

107
00:21:58,797 --> 00:22:03,291
I know these girls very much,
they simply need a stamp of love

108
00:22:04,103 --> 00:22:06,367
Leave me

109
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:36,859
I also don't want to work with a
rascal like you, note this...

110
00:22:37,102 --> 00:22:37,625
...new experience in your diary.

111
00:23:27,786 --> 00:23:34,350
Our eyes met. - What's
next? -The flowers bloomed

112
00:23:36,395 --> 00:23:41,389
What's next? - I lost my
peace. -What's next?

113
00:23:41,467 --> 00:23:46,234
We fell in love. - What's next?

114
00:23:47,473 --> 00:23:55,175
Next we will get married and
people will congratulate us.

115
00:24:05,758 --> 00:24:12,425
Our eyes met. - What's next? The
flowers bloomed. - What's next?

116
00:24:12,498 --> 00:24:21,463
I became restless. - What's next?
I fell in love. - What's next?

117
00:24:22,508 --> 00:24:30,074
Next we will get married and
people will congratulate us.

118
00:25:03,782 --> 00:25:08,014
Till when we will face this
bad luck,

119
00:25:21,266 --> 00:25:28,502
Till when'll we break the walls
that the society has built,

120
00:25:28,574 --> 00:25:37,380
Till when we will hide our love
from them, and be free

121
00:25:46,859 --> 00:25:51,353
This fear of getting insulted will
no more remain -When we will...

122
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:54,593
...get married, and they
will greet us.

123
00:26:10,716 --> 00:26:28,226
What's next? - Will my dear sing
romantic songs after marriage

124
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:39,806
Or will he simply sit beside me
and make me lose my peace

125
00:26:43,515 --> 00:26:48,316
After marriage, we will become
husband and wife, you will have...

126
00:26:48,387 --> 00:26:56,761
...a baby in your hands, and I'll
simply plead for your company.

127
00:26:56,828 --> 00:27:04,735
When we will get married
and people will congratulate us.

128
00:27:50,482 --> 00:27:53,645
Anil, are you sure you won't be
having drinks? - You know Tom...

129
00:27:53,719 --> 00:27:57,485
...I don't drink. - Anil,
I don't understand one thing.

130
00:27:57,556 --> 00:28:02,084
Indians are known to drink so
much of liquor! I was in the...

131
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:06,597
...lndian embassy for three years,
there I've seen that Indians eat...

132
00:28:06,665 --> 00:28:11,466
...drink and romance a lot. What
sort of an Indian are you?

133
00:28:11,536 --> 00:28:16,405
I might not drink, but I'm a
romantic person.

134
00:28:17,576 --> 00:28:22,343
Yes I know, your girl friend's
name is Shobha, whose photo...

135
00:28:22,414 --> 00:28:26,475
...is in your pocket, for 24 hours.
I don't get this. You are here...

136
00:28:26,551 --> 00:28:30,612
...for last three months now, and
still surviving on the soda and...

137
00:28:30,689 --> 00:28:35,626
...photo of your girlfriend. This is
the saturday night, party around.

138
00:28:35,694 --> 00:28:44,796
See we get 10 different girls
here. - And they romance...

139
00:28:45,037 --> 00:28:48,438
...in 10 minutes and also forget
in 10 minutes. But the Indian...

140
00:28:48,507 --> 00:28:52,500
...love is not for few minutes but
for a life time, my friend.

141
00:28:52,577 --> 00:28:54,442
And that to with a single person.

142
00:30:19,164 --> 00:30:21,689
Anil the girl is very nice, should
I talk to her. - Go,

143
00:30:31,843 --> 00:30:33,777
Who has come so early today?

144
00:30:40,685 --> 00:30:46,419
Why are you so silent, Vinney?
Come inside.

145
00:30:55,800 --> 00:31:00,169
What happened? Why are
you so quiet today?

146
00:31:07,212 --> 00:31:14,380
Rakesh, I'm pregnant. What will
happen now, my brother will...

147
00:31:14,452 --> 00:31:19,480
...return in 8 months, we cannot
get married before that...

148
00:31:19,558 --> 00:31:25,497
...and till that time mother will
come to know, she won't be...

149
00:31:25,564 --> 00:31:33,061
...able to bear this. I've met the
doctor, she says that it's too...

150
00:31:33,138 --> 00:31:40,738
...late for the abortion, my life is
in danger. I don't know what to...

151
00:31:40,812 --> 00:31:48,275
...do! I feel like commiting
suicide. -Don't even think about it.

152
00:31:51,756 --> 00:31:54,884
We might have done a
serious mistake, but not a sin.

153
00:31:55,126 --> 00:31:59,722
We love each other, we were
going to marry after some days...

154
00:31:59,798 --> 00:32:02,631
...but we will get married
immediately.

155
00:32:02,701 --> 00:32:07,331
But how'll my mother agree for
it before my brother returns?

156
00:32:07,405 --> 00:32:13,674
Don't worry, there'll be some
way out. Now you have added...

157
00:32:13,745 --> 00:32:17,772
...some more responsibilities on
my shoulders. For a single...

158
00:32:17,849 --> 00:32:22,616
...person this house was more
than enough, but now I'll have...

159
00:32:22,687 --> 00:32:26,350
...to look for a new flat and
some money. - But this'll take...

160
00:32:26,424 --> 00:32:30,622
...a lot of time. - No, my boss is
a very good person, he'll surely...

161
00:32:30,695 --> 00:32:36,600
...help us. Today it's Sunday, I'll
go to his place and tell him...

162
00:32:36,668 --> 00:32:40,399
...about this. We will marry
within a week or so. Is that ok.

163
00:32:59,357 --> 00:33:01,086
This might be the first time you
have come to my bunglow? - Yes.

164
00:33:01,159 --> 00:33:05,323
Actually I've some urgent work
otherwise I wouldn't disturb you

165
00:33:09,734 --> 00:33:13,670
The thing is that I live in a one
room flat given by the company.

166
00:33:13,738 --> 00:33:20,041
But now I want to have a big
flat and loan of Rs.50,000.

167
00:33:23,448 --> 00:33:29,648
Why do you need all this for?
- Sir I'm getting married...

168
00:33:33,291 --> 00:33:35,521
That is good, but why
this hurry?

169
00:33:38,063 --> 00:33:40,759
After two years you will get
promoted, then you'll get a...

170
00:33:40,832 --> 00:33:44,393
...bunglow, a car, why are you
hastening the thing?

171
00:33:45,804 --> 00:33:57,113
I know sir, but the girl that I
love is pregnant-ls it your child

172
00:33:57,182 --> 00:34:03,587
What? - I have more
experience, than you, the girl...

173
00:34:08,326 --> 00:34:14,265
...who is pregnant before getting
married is not a good choice...

174
00:34:14,332 --> 00:34:16,630
...for a bride, my friend. - But
she belongs to a good family...

175
00:34:16,701 --> 00:34:19,226
...and is a very good lady. She is
the only daughter of Seth...

176
00:34:19,304 --> 00:34:23,331
...Ramlal Verma. - The one
who owns a plastic industry?

177
00:34:27,512 --> 00:34:30,640
Yes sir. - And the one whose son
has gone to Germany. - Yes.

178
00:34:33,084 --> 00:34:36,178
Sorry, I must have spoken too
badly about your future wife...

179
00:34:36,254 --> 00:34:39,189
...now that you will be the son
in law of this family, I must...

180
00:34:39,257 --> 00:34:44,058
...congratulate you. Whatever help
you need I'll give you, I'll call...

181
00:34:44,129 --> 00:34:48,589
...the cashier tomorrow,
you meet him.

182
00:34:48,666 --> 00:34:51,863
Thank you sir, I'll never
forget this help of yours.

183
00:34:53,838 --> 00:34:59,799
What are your plans for today?
- Nothing much, but I was going...

184
00:34:59,878 --> 00:35:04,076
...to meet Vinny today. - So you'll
be going out today, then do me...

185
00:35:04,149 --> 00:35:09,212
...a favour, I want some
important documents from Pune.

186
00:35:09,287 --> 00:35:13,246
I don't want any one to know
about it, you could take my car.

187
00:35:17,095 --> 00:35:20,394
You will return by evening.
- Sir, where should I go in pune?

188
00:35:43,788 --> 00:35:46,621
What is this? Who are you
people? - Drive the vehicle...

189
00:35:46,691 --> 00:35:49,091
...as we direct you.

190
00:36:00,772 --> 00:36:05,402
I have done the job sir.
- He didn't get a hint, right?

191
00:36:05,477 --> 00:36:12,007
Not at all sir-Listen, take good
care of him, but till the time...

192
00:36:12,083 --> 00:36:17,146
...I call you, don't leave him.
- Don't bother about it.

193
00:36:32,704 --> 00:36:37,471
Hey friend, do you remember me?
I remember you so much,

194
00:36:39,444 --> 00:36:40,706
Please come early.

195
00:36:48,152 --> 00:36:49,779
Is this Shobha. - May I know
who is speaking?

196
00:36:49,854 --> 00:36:56,555
Your one and only friend, J. K
- You. - I've got a news

197
00:36:56,628 --> 00:37:00,997
The respect of the family that
you are getting married into...

198
00:37:01,065 --> 00:37:06,526
...is in danger. The name of your
sister in law is Vinney, right?

199
00:37:06,604 --> 00:37:11,234
She is going to be a mother
soon. - What are you saying?

200
00:37:14,345 --> 00:37:16,779
Won't you even thank me? He
works in my company, I don't...

201
00:37:17,015 --> 00:37:21,384
...know where he has gone
for so many days.

202
00:37:51,849 --> 00:37:56,752
What's the problem? You look
tense. - No I'm not.

203
00:37:56,821 --> 00:38:01,781
Are you all right? - What's
wrong with me? But how did...

204
00:38:02,026 --> 00:38:06,360
...you drop in so late? - Just like
that, I'd not met you for long...

205
00:38:06,431 --> 00:38:11,767
So I came now. How are you?
- I'm just fine.

206
00:38:15,273 --> 00:38:20,677
Vinney, I'm going to be your
sister-in- law, you are like a...

207
00:38:20,745 --> 00:38:27,150
...sister to me. Won't you talk to
me about the things that you...

208
00:38:27,218 --> 00:38:32,053
...might not discuss with Anil or
your mother? I may help you.

209
00:38:36,694 --> 00:38:41,495
This means that what I've heard
is true. You are pregnant

210
00:38:43,234 --> 00:38:48,695
I have done a big mistake.
But how did you come to know...

211
00:38:50,608 --> 00:38:53,771
...l'd only told this to Rakesh.
- What did he say?

212
00:38:55,580 --> 00:39:00,074
He said that we will soon get
married. - Where does he stay?

213
00:39:00,151 --> 00:39:08,752
I want to meet him. - Since five
days he is missing, he hasn't...

214
00:39:08,993 --> 00:39:13,191
...called me up even once.
- May be he has left you and...

215
00:39:15,133 --> 00:39:22,369
No I've full faith in him.
- Still what if your mother...

216
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:31,075
...comes to know about this?
- No, I'll commit suicide before it

217
00:39:31,149 --> 00:39:37,452
The doctor has said that nothing
can be done. I'll die.

218
00:39:39,457 --> 00:39:43,291
No Vinney, you have done a
mistake, by which our family...

219
00:39:43,361 --> 00:39:49,425
...will lose respect in the
society. I won't let this happen.

220
00:39:53,037 --> 00:39:58,498
Yes Vinney, Anil's house is my
own house, and this is my...

221
00:39:58,576 --> 00:40:07,245
...responsibility towards my
family. Don't worry, lt'll be fine.

222
00:40:26,637 --> 00:40:31,540
I'm Shobha here.
- Who else could it be?

223
00:40:31,609 --> 00:40:39,072
I wanted to meet you -I'm
honoured. I wanted to hear this.

224
00:40:41,819 --> 00:40:45,482
I want to discuss some important
matter with you. - Then come in...

225
00:40:45,556 --> 00:40:49,287
...the evening at my bunglow. - At
your place? - Yes, in the office...

226
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,794
...we talk about only the official
things, excuse me.

227
00:41:07,378 --> 00:41:10,370
I beg you, tell me where he is?

228
00:41:16,354 --> 00:41:20,120
Why are you so restless to
know? - Just for Vinney's sake.

229
00:41:20,191 --> 00:41:25,857
You know it better! - Yes
I know, she is pregnant.

230
00:41:31,469 --> 00:41:38,875
And the respect of your in law's
family is in danger.

231
00:41:40,278 --> 00:41:43,270
Yes, so please tell me, so that
they will get married soon.

232
00:41:43,347 --> 00:41:44,837
That is in your hands now.

233
00:41:54,525 --> 00:41:57,460
To save the respect of the
family, what can you do?

234
00:41:57,528 --> 00:42:04,366
I can give my life too. -You don't
need to do so much, marry me.

235
00:42:07,205 --> 00:42:16,341
What? - I had told you
that I'll get you in the end.

236
00:42:18,449 --> 00:42:20,747
By chance, I got the opportunity.
- This is impossible.

237
00:42:20,818 --> 00:42:23,685
I'll promise you that after we
get married, Vinney and Rakesh...

238
00:42:23,754 --> 00:42:33,254
...will get married. Otherwise you
will not be able to save the...

239
00:42:33,331 --> 00:42:37,700
...family from this dishonour by
giving your life too.

240
00:42:51,282 --> 00:42:54,718
Think twice before giving a reply
I'm in no hurry at all.

241
00:43:27,618 --> 00:43:36,424
Vinney loves Rakesh. And she is
pregnant & wants to get married.

242
00:43:56,213 --> 00:44:00,309
I am giving you the
responsibility of my family...

243
00:44:03,521 --> 00:44:06,422
Save them from this disgrace,
just as I would.

244
00:44:10,261 --> 00:44:13,253
I had told you that I'll get
you in the end.

245
00:44:16,834 --> 00:44:20,395
Will I spoil my entire life, by
marrying J. K, for Vinney's sake?

246
00:44:27,211 --> 00:44:33,673
I'll commit suicide, doctor has
said that nothing can be done.

247
00:44:38,422 --> 00:44:40,754
No Vinney, every thing will
be alright.

248
00:44:56,574 --> 00:45:06,279
I had promised you that, I will
save the pride of your family.

249
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:11,378
So today, I'm going to do just
the same, there is no other way.

250
00:45:36,647 --> 00:45:40,549
This is Shobha. - Why did you
call me so late, what should...

251
00:45:40,618 --> 00:45:44,247
...I do for you?
- I'm ready to get married,

252
00:45:44,321 --> 00:45:48,314
I was expecting this reply from
you. So when should we marry?

253
00:45:50,861 --> 00:45:54,194
But I have a request. - You
should order now.

254
00:45:54,265 --> 00:45:58,531
No one should know about our
marriage, before they get married

255
00:45:58,602 --> 00:46:01,002
I'd do just the same, don't worry

256
00:46:13,717 --> 00:46:16,447
What are you saying, why should
they get married, before Anil's...

257
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:19,751
...return, only a few months are
left now for his return.

258
00:46:19,824 --> 00:46:24,386
There is no other way out.
Rakesh is all alone and he...

259
00:46:24,462 --> 00:46:28,694
...respects his boss very much,
he can't let his word down...

260
00:46:28,766 --> 00:46:34,466
...and he wants him to get
married to a girl he knows.

261
00:46:34,538 --> 00:46:39,407
If Rakesh gets married to her,
Vinney will kill herself.

262
00:46:41,745 --> 00:46:47,183
I have called up Anil and he is
fine with it. - As you say...

263
00:46:49,553 --> 00:46:53,080
...but, this is the first marriage
in the house, and that too so...

264
00:46:53,157 --> 00:47:00,495
...hastily. - It's all in the fate.
We think of some thing,

265
00:47:03,601 --> 00:47:07,196
And something else happens.
Good bye mother.

266
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:37,667
Take blessings of your elders.

267
00:47:49,513 --> 00:47:54,314
This is your good luck that you
got the right husband, may God...

268
00:47:54,385 --> 00:48:00,051
...always keep you happy. Only
if this ceremony would take...

269
00:48:00,124 --> 00:48:05,426
...place in Anil's presence!
Go and take the Blessings of...

270
00:48:05,496 --> 00:48:06,155
...your sister in law.

271
00:48:15,372 --> 00:48:20,435
May god give you all the
happiness in life & never fight.

272
00:48:22,313 --> 00:48:24,508
By listening to you we have
managed to conduct this...

273
00:48:24,582 --> 00:48:28,109
...ceremony in a subdued way, let
Anil come, we will arrange your...

274
00:48:28,185 --> 00:48:38,390
...marriage in a grand fashion
and fulfil my wishes

275
00:48:40,097 --> 00:48:43,089
Now what marriage are we
talking about, I've given up...

276
00:48:43,167 --> 00:48:47,570
...my dreams before coming
to this place.

277
00:48:59,216 --> 00:49:00,513
Congratulations J. K
- Thank you.

278
00:49:00,584 --> 00:49:04,145
Let me introduce you to them.

279
00:49:13,063 --> 00:49:28,104
This is Rani, Shabnam, and this
is Reena. These are my special...

280
00:49:28,178 --> 00:49:36,608
...girl friends. They all love me
very much, just because I have...

281
00:49:36,687 --> 00:49:43,820
...given them a flat, a car, and
2000 Rs. Allowance each month!!

282
00:49:50,434 --> 00:49:58,034
May be it is not true but they
give me love, which you...

283
00:49:58,108 --> 00:50:00,633
...will never be able to give me.

284
00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:44,746
Excuse me I don't drink. - So
who is asking you to drink, just...

285
00:50:44,822 --> 00:50:48,417
...touch it with your lips,
Honeymoon is not enjoyable till...

286
00:50:48,492 --> 00:50:58,834
...you drink champagne, just a
sip. - No. - Now as I am your...

287
00:50:58,902 --> 00:51:05,102
...husband, you'll have to
listen to me. Drink this.

288
00:51:05,175 --> 00:51:11,603
Except for this whatever you tell
me, I'm ready to do it.

289
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:22,284
You neither listened to my
request nor my order.

290
00:51:26,196 --> 00:51:30,064
But whatever I desired has
always happened.

291
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:44,479
Today is our honeymoon, go and
sleep in the room upstairs.

292
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:13,605
How could this happen? I wanted
Shobha to be my daughter in law

293
00:52:13,677 --> 00:52:17,113
Even I was taken aback when I
read this news, How could...

294
00:52:17,181 --> 00:52:20,378
...Shobha get married to J. K
when she was engaged to Anil.

295
00:52:20,451 --> 00:52:23,852
First, she supported the marriage
of Vinney in the absence of Anil.

296
00:52:24,087 --> 00:52:27,250
And then she got married to
Rakesh's boss.

297
00:52:27,324 --> 00:52:30,452
Why did Shobha do this? -There
must be only one reason...

298
00:52:30,527 --> 00:52:37,330
...for this, J. K has more money
than Anil. So she might...

299
00:52:38,435 --> 00:52:42,496
I can't believe that Shobha can
do all these just for the sake...

300
00:52:42,573 --> 00:52:48,443
...of money. She might have been
forced to marry him!

301
00:52:48,512 --> 00:52:52,505
If it was so, she could've told
you this before getting married.

302
00:52:55,118 --> 00:53:00,420
We misjudged her, now don't
even talk about her. Now what...

303
00:53:00,491 --> 00:53:07,727
...we've to think of is, how will
Anil face this when he'll return.

304
00:53:11,702 --> 00:53:18,039
God will not keep the one happy,
who betrayed my son.

305
00:53:19,676 --> 00:53:23,578
Good afternoon sir.
- Good afternoon.

306
00:53:27,651 --> 00:53:29,175
I won't forget the favours
you did to me.

307
00:53:29,253 --> 00:53:34,714
Just do one more favour for me,
I wanted leave for 15 days.

308
00:53:42,799 --> 00:53:48,101
I must thank you instead. Hadn't
you have an affair with Vinney...

309
00:53:48,171 --> 00:53:53,632
...I wouldn't have been able to
force Shobha to marry me

310
00:53:56,446 --> 00:54:03,181
But she loves Anil... - She used
to love Anil, now she is my wife

311
00:54:03,253 --> 00:54:08,190
To break her ego, I'll see to it
that she is not happy for the...

312
00:54:08,258 --> 00:54:16,165
...the rest of her life. She had
insulted me in my office, that...

313
00:54:16,233 --> 00:54:21,694
...moment I had taken oath
to teach her a lesson,

314
00:54:24,741 --> 00:54:28,336
And then you gave me an
opportunity.

315
00:54:30,414 --> 00:54:38,253
That means you were the one
who got me kidnapped

316
00:54:39,756 --> 00:54:43,283
Of course! I get whatever
I want.

317
00:54:46,797 --> 00:54:50,665
By hook or by crook.
- I didn't know that you are...

318
00:54:50,734 --> 00:54:54,192
...such a low person, I'll quit
this job right now.

319
00:55:22,099 --> 00:55:31,201
Why aren't you saying anything?
Is everything alright at home?

320
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:40,348
What is this? - Till now
I had never accepted...

321
00:55:40,417 --> 00:55:45,753
...you as my sister in law, but
today I came to know that you...

322
00:55:45,822 --> 00:55:53,194
...are so great. Just for our sake
you spoiled your life.

323
00:55:58,201 --> 00:56:00,260
How did you come to know this?
- J. K told me everything.

324
00:56:02,172 --> 00:56:06,302
I had gone to ask for a leave,
but there I got to know the...

325
00:56:06,376 --> 00:56:14,112
...reality, about why you married
J.K., I was very ashamed and I...

326
00:56:14,184 --> 00:56:21,147
...immediatly resigned from job
- I didn't want Anil's family to...

327
00:56:21,224 --> 00:56:32,601
...know why I married him. I
wanted every one to hate me.

328
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:41,470
But since you have come to
know, promise me that you...

329
00:56:41,545 --> 00:56:47,381
...will hide this secret from Anil,
Mother and everyone else

330
00:56:52,589 --> 00:57:00,052
Please promise me, -We shall
behave the way you want.

331
00:57:06,470 --> 00:57:09,132
Now both of you leave
before he's here.

332
00:57:51,414 --> 00:57:56,545
Oh mother, And how are you
Ashok. - I'm fine. Welcome home.

333
00:57:56,620 --> 00:58:00,283
Where is Vinney? - She's in Delhi
Ashok nowadays works there

334
00:58:05,162 --> 00:58:08,029
You go home and I'll bring your
luggage. - Where is Shobha?

335
00:58:08,098 --> 00:58:16,472
Let's go. -You're hiding something
from me. Why didn't she come?

336
00:58:18,542 --> 00:58:24,777
Mother, -The thing is..., -Why
aren't you saying anything? Last...

337
00:58:25,048 --> 00:58:27,642
...week she wrote to me that she
would recieve me, Then I called...

338
00:58:27,717 --> 00:58:32,086
...her up but she was not there,
I'd told her mother about...

339
00:58:32,155 --> 00:58:41,086
...my arrival. Is everything all
right? - Now try to forget about

340
00:58:41,164 --> 00:58:43,428
...her. She has got married.

341
00:58:47,204 --> 00:58:54,474
What? Is it true brother? - It's
true, Now she's married to J.K.

342
00:59:33,617 --> 00:59:42,252
Could I speak to Shobha. - Mrs
J. K? She's gone out with J. K

343
01:00:17,527 --> 01:00:20,394
Who's there?
- It's me, Ashok.

344
01:00:20,463 --> 01:00:26,766
Do you want me to sign on some
papers. - No I wanted to talk.

345
01:00:30,206 --> 01:00:33,642
What is it?
- Are you the first man, who...

346
01:00:33,710 --> 01:00:45,747
...is being betrayed by a women?
I understand the shock you've got

347
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:55,493
But you've to fulfill your father's
dream, for which U went abroad

348
01:00:59,803 --> 01:01:08,507
What should I do, brother?
I cannot forget her.

349
01:01:10,780 --> 01:01:21,418
I think that you should go some
where, time heals every sorrow.

350
01:01:21,491 --> 01:01:25,587
May be when you will get some
solace, and think about it, you...

351
01:01:25,662 --> 01:01:33,433
...will find that Shobha who
caused you so much pain, was...

352
01:01:33,503 --> 01:01:44,311
...never meant to be your wife.
- Lf only this would happen.

353
01:01:44,381 --> 01:01:49,876
You can always try, if you think
me to be your big brother then...

354
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:55,148
...do as I say. I will book your
tickets for tomorrow.

355
01:02:13,777 --> 01:02:15,074
Bring the luggage.

356
01:03:37,794 --> 01:03:46,532
Oh! How stupid are these
anklets...

357
01:03:49,706 --> 01:03:53,574
One day they'll kill me due to it

358
01:04:02,051 --> 01:04:11,483
My face turned red due to shame
as they make noise on the street

359
01:04:11,561 --> 01:04:17,329
How stupid are the anklets,

360
01:04:56,139 --> 01:05:00,166
How can one hide his
expressions...

361
01:05:00,243 --> 01:05:05,806
...when there is problem
in the family

362
01:05:19,362 --> 01:05:24,095
Whatever oath you take to hide
it, it will anyway come out

363
01:05:24,167 --> 01:05:31,801
The anklets have no religion
such as Hindu or Muslim

364
01:05:32,041 --> 01:05:38,139
Oh! How stupid are
these anklets.

365
01:06:23,693 --> 01:06:27,823
When I wear them they
make a sweet sound,

366
01:06:35,104 --> 01:06:43,512
But I also feel a pain
like being pierced

367
01:06:46,749 --> 01:06:56,454
And when I remove them from
my legs, I feel as if I'm dead.

368
01:06:59,529 --> 01:07:07,800
The anklets make my life &
are my desires.

369
01:07:10,673 --> 01:07:14,700
Oh! Stupid are these anklets.
One day these will kill me

370
01:07:59,722 --> 01:08:03,055
Everyone enjoyed your dance
yesterday, it was great.

371
01:08:03,126 --> 01:08:07,222
That was the matter of my
father's prestige, it had to be...

372
01:08:07,296 --> 01:08:11,130
...great, isn't it father?
You are not eating anything,

373
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:16,467
...have these Parathas
- It seems, even the head chef

374
01:08:16,539 --> 01:08:19,269
...has seen your programme
yesterday, he's mesmerised.

375
01:08:19,342 --> 01:08:24,041
Everybody would have been!
- We had to beat up so many...

376
01:08:24,113 --> 01:08:26,104
...people for her sake.
- And send so many to hospital.

377
01:08:28,184 --> 01:08:37,650
But I fear the one who will
marry her and take her away...

378
01:08:37,727 --> 01:08:42,687
...from me -No father, I will
never get married.

379
01:08:47,470 --> 01:08:51,770
Whether one wants or not, a
girl has to get married someday...

380
01:08:51,841 --> 01:08:56,403
...or the other, there is always
some one made for them, but...

381
01:08:56,479 --> 01:08:59,141
...when they'll meet
is written in their destiny.

382
01:09:17,366 --> 01:09:21,234
How did you get this song?
- Oh, I recorded it because it's...

383
01:09:21,304 --> 01:09:24,364
...a good song, have a seat.
- No thanks. This song is the...

384
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:27,000
...speciality of our program, you
don't have any right to record it.

385
01:09:27,410 --> 01:09:29,002
But now I've
recorded it already.

386
01:09:32,482 --> 01:09:37,112
We make & sing our own songs,
we don't give them to others.

387
01:09:59,408 --> 01:10:03,401
Why are you looking at the
fishes, Mr. Saxena. You are not...

388
01:10:03,479 --> 01:10:10,476
...drinking & you are'nt intoxicated
- No I'm scared of my wife.

389
01:10:12,121 --> 01:10:14,419
She won't let me in if I drink
too much, I'll have to sit out...

390
01:10:14,490 --> 01:10:21,293
...all night long, like a dog.
- I know your past well.

391
01:10:32,575 --> 01:10:36,341
Why are you still in sari, haven't
I told you to wear the pink...

392
01:10:36,412 --> 01:10:42,317
...chiffon maxi. Now go and make
Saxena's drinks. And change...

393
01:10:42,385 --> 01:10:44,785
...this dress within two minutes.

394
01:10:57,233 --> 01:10:59,599
Give it to me sister in law, I'll
make my own drink. Please go...

395
01:10:59,669 --> 01:11:02,661
...inside. J.K. Seems to be
out of his mind.

396
01:11:05,041 --> 01:11:07,202
Change your clothes in
two minutes.

397
01:11:08,511 --> 01:11:11,241
J.K. What has happened to you,
insulting you wife in front of...

398
01:11:11,314 --> 01:11:15,148
...your friends is a very bad
thing. - You don't know...

399
01:11:15,217 --> 01:11:22,316
...this lady had insulted me in my
office, that very moment I'd...

400
01:11:22,391 --> 01:11:27,226
...taken an oath to take revange
on her throughout my life.

401
01:11:35,571 --> 01:11:42,340
You might be seeing many figures
in your account book every day...

402
01:11:42,411 --> 01:11:44,174
...now see my wife's
figure today.

403
01:11:44,246 --> 01:11:48,706
J.k. I knew that you were a big
flirt, but didn't know that you...

404
01:11:48,784 --> 01:11:52,220
...could be such a
shameless bastard.

405
01:13:02,158 --> 01:13:04,683
When did my friends leave?
- After midnight.

406
01:13:09,165 --> 01:13:14,626
I insulted you in front of them,
- That's not a new thing, now...

407
01:13:14,704 --> 01:13:17,696
...l'm used to it. - Are you a
human or a stone?

408
01:13:20,543 --> 01:13:25,037
Don't you have any effect of all
my insults on you?

409
01:13:29,852 --> 01:13:32,616
It does, but what's the use?

410
01:13:34,390 --> 01:13:41,228
You listen to your heart,
I listen to my soul

411
01:14:23,139 --> 01:14:26,336
Why did you stop the song?
Does this also belong to you?

412
01:14:26,408 --> 01:14:32,438
I did a mistake by removing your
cassette that day. My father...

413
01:14:32,515 --> 01:14:36,781
...scolded me very much, he said
songs are soulmates of everyone.

414
01:14:36,852 --> 01:14:40,515
I promise I'll return
that to you. -OK.

415
01:14:42,458 --> 01:14:54,199
Listen, I shouldn't ask you, but
why are you so sad?

416
01:15:00,309 --> 01:15:08,341
Why do U keep yourself isolated
Tell me what's the reason?

417
01:15:10,386 --> 01:15:11,216
There is some reason.

418
01:15:17,193 --> 01:15:21,459
I got to know the reason, some
girl must have broken your heart.

419
01:15:23,098 --> 01:15:29,765
Isn't it? What did she do?
- She married someone else.

420
01:15:31,473 --> 01:15:32,531
So what? You too get married
to someone else.

421
01:15:32,608 --> 01:15:34,337
You will get lots of girls
to marry.

422
01:15:36,512 --> 01:15:41,108
You can't marry just anyone out
there. - This is also right.

423
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:48,783
Then do one thing, forget about
her. Look, it's the sunset.

424
01:15:56,832 --> 01:16:03,670
This is the most wonderful sight,
take a look. - I hate sunsets.

425
01:16:38,574 --> 01:16:43,568
Call the doctor urgently, tell the
driver to get the car ready

426
01:18:06,628 --> 01:18:11,224
Do you always sit alone for the
breakfast here -Yes, will U join

427
01:18:13,602 --> 01:18:17,197
Is this any kind of breakfast,
these eggs, with this bread...

428
01:18:17,272 --> 01:18:21,709
...and this lid, we have some
thing different

429
01:18:21,777 --> 01:18:26,237
What is that? - Alu & Gobi
Paratha. And thick curd.

430
01:18:28,784 --> 01:18:30,581
That is very much
mouth -watering

431
01:18:30,652 --> 01:18:34,418
Then why don't you join us
tomorrow morning?

432
01:18:34,490 --> 01:18:40,554
But what will your father think?
- That I've invited someone.

433
01:18:40,629 --> 01:18:44,395
Doesn't anyone have a hold on
you? - No, parents have their...

434
01:18:44,466 --> 01:18:51,429
...hold on children. But I don't
have any.

435
01:18:51,507 --> 01:18:56,706
Meaning? - I was found on the
river bank, as my father says.

436
01:18:56,779 --> 01:19:03,275
I was lying unconscious then. He
took me with him, & brought me...

437
01:19:03,352 --> 01:19:07,379
...up as his daughter. So the one
who was an orphan, has a...

438
01:19:07,456 --> 01:19:11,256
...father and many brothers and
sisters today. -Brother & sisters?

439
01:19:11,326 --> 01:19:14,625
Yes, the one who work with me
in the programme.

440
01:19:18,700 --> 01:19:22,727
Should I tell you something?
- Yes. - Stop hating the sunset.

441
01:19:24,807 --> 01:19:30,370
It's very bad to hate anything,
It's a disease which will never...

442
01:19:30,446 --> 01:19:36,442
...be cured. Give me a chance,
For what? -To remove the hatred

443
01:19:36,518 --> 01:19:45,722
...from your mind. I'll be waiting
for you on the sunset point.

444
01:20:21,797 --> 01:20:27,167
You reached before me.
- Please come

445
01:20:30,672 --> 01:20:33,698
I didn't want to keep you waiting
for me. -Someone will've to wait

446
01:20:39,114 --> 01:20:40,342
Who would like
to be yours.

447
01:20:46,388 --> 01:20:54,318
Don't look here, look at the
sun set. Have you ever...

448
01:20:54,396 --> 01:20:59,356
...thought that this sun gives us
life & spreads his golden charm...

449
01:20:59,434 --> 01:21:07,170
...all over? There are many stars
in the sky but none like the Sun

450
01:21:09,178 --> 01:21:13,376
Did your father teach you all
this, -No these are my thoughts

451
01:21:13,448 --> 01:21:17,179
I am telling you all these so that
you forget the past -I forgot.

452
01:21:19,188 --> 01:21:24,490
What is your name? - Sona [gold]
Oh!! - Why, what happened?

453
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:30,863
I was just thinking where does
the golden charm of the Sun go

454
01:21:31,099 --> 01:21:39,632
Now I have understood that it
must be within you.

455
01:22:52,447 --> 01:22:56,884
These are my special girlfriends,
they love me because I have...

456
01:22:57,119 --> 01:23:03,615
...given them a flat, a car, and
Rs 2000 per month. It may not...

457
01:23:03,692 --> 01:23:09,494
...be true love, but you won't be
able to give me even that much.

458
01:23:13,468 --> 01:23:19,236
Everyday you look the figures
of the accounts, now look at...

459
01:23:19,308 --> 01:23:25,508
...my wife's figure. I insult you
everyday, but you...

460
01:23:25,580 --> 01:23:30,176
...don't get angry ever. Doesn't
it even effect you?

461
01:23:31,753 --> 01:23:43,290
It does. But you listen to your
heart and I listen to my soul.

462
01:24:32,214 --> 01:24:39,313
You must be astonished to see
me so early. You will be even...

463
01:24:39,388 --> 01:24:44,519
...more astonished, I want
one cup of tea.

464
01:24:44,593 --> 01:24:47,118
Tea? That too at this
evening hour?

465
01:24:51,400 --> 01:24:55,461
Yes, times do change. But it
takes a lot of time for a...

466
01:24:55,537 --> 01:25:01,533
...person to change. Today I
want to speak a lot to you.

467
01:25:03,378 --> 01:25:04,675
Go and bring some tea.

468
01:25:25,233 --> 01:25:30,432
What's wrong
with you today?

469
01:25:36,645 --> 01:25:38,670
Today I've realised my mistakes

470
01:25:41,349 --> 01:25:48,084
Specially the type of behaviour
that I had with you was not a...

471
01:25:48,156 --> 01:25:53,355
...mistake but a crime.

472
01:26:02,671 --> 01:26:13,172
I'm a criminal. And a criminal
must pay in some or other way.

473
01:26:13,248 --> 01:26:17,048
Don't speak like this.
- No, let me speak today.

474
01:26:21,289 --> 01:26:27,057
I want to repent. I want to say
sorry for the way I behaved.

475
01:26:40,509 --> 01:26:45,310
If you forgive me, then I'm
ready to face any punishment

476
01:26:50,318 --> 01:26:56,086
There is no need of that now
It's enough that you've repented.

477
01:26:58,260 --> 01:27:01,696
You think that we've just married

478
01:27:16,378 --> 01:27:20,337
Come here, close to me.

479
01:27:33,228 --> 01:27:35,389
You were right. We
have just married.

480
01:27:41,336 --> 01:27:44,533
Those days
won't come again.

481
01:27:48,243 --> 01:27:51,212
The future happiness will wash
away the tears of the past.

482
01:27:52,280 --> 01:27:54,805
You are very nice, Shobha.

483
01:28:17,539 --> 01:28:18,471
Come here, please.

484
01:28:26,281 --> 01:28:27,612
What were you doing there?

485
01:28:27,682 --> 01:28:34,144
I was thinking that I was lost in
the darkness of sorrow, and...

486
01:28:34,222 --> 01:28:40,218
...you came from nowhere, as
a light, and gave me hope.

487
01:28:44,232 --> 01:28:48,191
Now that you are so much close
to my heart, don't go away.

488
01:28:51,139 --> 01:28:52,197
Look there,

489
01:28:59,114 --> 01:29:03,380
When the sunrays touch these
snowy mountain peaks, they...

490
01:29:03,451 --> 01:29:11,483
...melt into a river and flow
towards the sea, too meet...

491
01:29:16,498 --> 01:29:17,192
...it permanently.

492
01:29:17,565 --> 01:29:20,125
I'll also meet in your love like
the river permanently.

493
01:29:23,271 --> 01:29:24,670
I'll not go leave you and
go anywhere

494
01:30:34,776 --> 01:30:37,802
May I know who is this?
- The same one who loved you,

495
01:30:37,879 --> 01:30:43,078
...with all his heart once.
- Where are you speaking from?

496
01:30:43,151 --> 01:30:47,611
The same hotel that you are
staying in. I want to meet you.

497
01:30:47,689 --> 01:30:54,424
Why? - To know,
why did you leave me

498
01:30:54,496 --> 01:30:59,126
Now I'm a married
woman and...

499
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:02,795
...you should not ask this sort of
question to a married woman.

500
01:31:03,037 --> 01:31:07,030
Don't ever call me.
- Who was it Shobha?

501
01:31:07,108 --> 01:31:10,305
A friend of mine.
- How come?

502
01:31:10,378 --> 01:31:16,078
She must have seen us here.
- Don't worry, get ready...

503
01:31:16,151 --> 01:31:19,086
...we'll go out.
- Ok.

504
01:32:36,928 --> 01:32:42,662
Ladies and gentlemen Nandkumar
will sing to entertain you.

505
01:32:45,770 --> 01:32:54,701
Sir, if you permit, I would like
to sing a song -Sure, come here.

506
01:32:57,848 --> 01:32:59,475
This is Mr. Anil Kumar Verma.

507
01:33:12,797 --> 01:33:16,028
Mr. Anil, sing anything
on love.

508
01:33:20,938 --> 01:33:37,651
Love has become a trade now
and trade has become love.

509
01:33:44,729 --> 01:33:58,006
Love has become a trade
and trade has become love.

510
01:34:33,177 --> 01:34:41,881
Playing with some one's heart,
and then leaving them...

511
01:34:48,693 --> 01:34:55,189
...as if they are toys,

512
01:34:59,637 --> 01:35:04,165
This has become
the habit of beautiful girls.

513
01:35:04,408 --> 01:35:18,186
Love has become a trade,
and trade has become love.

514
01:35:43,180 --> 01:35:52,646
In the past it was
known as betrayal,

515
01:35:59,063 --> 01:36:03,762
But now it's shamelessness

516
01:36:06,737 --> 01:36:13,006
It has become the attitude of
the respected people...

517
01:36:56,120 --> 01:37:04,926
She was the goddess of
the temple...

518
01:37:07,465 --> 01:37:15,668
And she used to be
very beautifull

519
01:37:17,775 --> 01:37:26,479
But look how she looks now

520
01:38:09,994 --> 01:38:15,159
You might have removed hatred
from my mind Sona, but you...

521
01:38:15,399 --> 01:38:19,096
...can't remove Shobha's
memories from my mind.

522
01:38:19,169 --> 01:38:26,666
How did you suddenly remember
Shobha today. - Sona do you...

523
01:38:26,744 --> 01:38:31,010
...know, Shobha & her husband
have come to stay in our hotel.

524
01:38:31,081 --> 01:38:35,074
So what? This is a hotel.
Anyone can come and stay here.

525
01:38:35,152 --> 01:38:40,886
I asked her to meet me, but she
refused to me right away.

526
01:38:40,958 --> 01:38:48,364
She's right. She's someone else's
wife now. Had I been in her...

527
01:38:48,432 --> 01:38:50,457
...place, I would have
done the same thing.

528
01:38:55,039 --> 01:39:01,171
Do you always drink? - I've
drunk for the first time today

529
01:39:01,412 --> 01:39:04,813
And if you drink, will
she leave her husband?

530
01:39:08,919 --> 01:39:12,548
This is the first and the last
time, I drank. I hate liquor.

531
01:39:24,935 --> 01:39:33,104
Please forgive me, I was lost.
From now on I'll do as you say

532
01:39:44,722 --> 01:39:46,849
Come let's go to the hotel.

533
01:40:06,577 --> 01:40:09,910
What happened to you?
- Nothing, a sudden pain.

534
01:40:09,980 --> 01:40:16,385
Please give me the medicine.
- Yes, here.

535
01:40:22,192 --> 01:40:25,423
Your face has turned pale, you
seem to be in pain, I'll call the...

536
01:40:25,496 --> 01:40:29,626
...doctor immediately. - There's
no need. Now no doctor can help.

537
01:40:31,402 --> 01:40:33,495
Please don't say like that.

538
01:40:41,712 --> 01:40:50,745
Now I can't hide anything from
you. My liver is...

539
01:40:50,821 --> 01:40:54,780
...completely damaged, I have
shown to very big specialists...

540
01:40:57,895 --> 01:41:02,992
They have declared that I won't
live for more than 3-4 months

541
01:41:07,471 --> 01:41:12,670
This is the only result one gets,
when he drinks day and night...

542
01:41:12,743 --> 01:41:15,041
...and troubles his body.

543
01:41:18,048 --> 01:41:26,513
I've realised this very late,
but I wanted to improve,

544
01:41:26,590 --> 01:41:31,084
I wanted to make our lives much
better. I wanted to give you the

545
01:41:34,832 --> 01:41:41,897
...happiness that I had taken
away from you.

546
01:41:45,476 --> 01:41:46,500
But now this won't happen.

547
01:41:46,577 --> 01:41:52,675
Don't say like this. Doctor is not
God. Nothing will happen to you.

548
01:41:52,750 --> 01:41:59,815
You will become alright.
- By falsely comforting me...

549
01:41:59,890 --> 01:42:07,228
...we can entertain our mind, but
can't delay the death.

550
01:42:10,901 --> 01:42:18,103
If the death can spare few
moments of life, I'd like to...

551
01:42:18,175 --> 01:42:25,911
...give you all the happiness of
this world. And then leave this...

552
01:42:25,983 --> 01:42:27,917
...world with a smiling face.

553
01:42:31,922 --> 01:42:33,913
What is this? This is not
what I had ordered.

554
01:42:33,991 --> 01:42:37,654
This is what madam has ordered.
- Which madam? - This madam.

555
01:42:39,563 --> 01:42:42,623
From now on, all the English
breakfast is to be stopped.

556
01:42:42,699 --> 01:42:45,725
This is what I've ordered,
Parothas, Lassi, and curd.

557
01:42:45,803 --> 01:42:49,034
From now on you will be eating
only Indian breakfast.

558
01:42:49,106 --> 01:42:53,167
Which means that I'll have to
follow your orders.

559
01:42:54,645 --> 01:42:58,604
Yes, father says that I should
take good care of you.

560
01:43:00,951 --> 01:43:03,818
This is what your father says
or is it you?

561
01:43:06,056 --> 01:43:07,455
Eat your breakfast.

562
01:43:35,018 --> 01:43:38,715
What is the case Mr. Joshi?
- Mr. J. K felt seriously ill, his...

563
01:43:38,789 --> 01:43:41,087
...wife is taking him
to Delhi. Very sad.

564
01:43:57,941 --> 01:44:00,671
Isn't this Shobha?
- How did you come to know?

565
01:44:02,045 --> 01:44:06,812
From your face.
- The thing is that her husband...

566
01:44:06,884 --> 01:44:10,183
...suddenly fell ill.
- May God cure him soon.

567
01:44:10,420 --> 01:44:12,513
Let's go and have the breakfast.

568
01:44:25,102 --> 01:44:27,502
You must have felt bored sitting
in the hospital for a long time.

569
01:44:29,740 --> 01:44:32,903
Why don't you go home for some
time. - I'm allright here.

570
01:44:34,478 --> 01:44:41,975
Announcing this, I'm a little sad
and also little happy today.

571
01:44:44,087 --> 01:44:51,016
I'm sad as this is the last item
of Sona, and happy due to the...

572
01:44:51,094 --> 01:44:55,929
...reason that she has
found her life partner.

573
01:44:58,702 --> 01:45:06,973
A handsome, and capable person
who is here, Mr. Anil Verma.

574
01:46:17,614 --> 01:46:30,687
Fate had already written
the time of our meeting

575
01:46:31,762 --> 01:46:37,928
Only some days are
left for our union

576
01:46:38,435 --> 01:46:50,370
Fate had already written
the time of our meeting

577
01:46:51,448 --> 01:47:12,394
Only some days are
left for our union

578
01:47:44,101 --> 01:47:54,909
It is difficult to go
away from this city.

579
01:47:55,879 --> 01:48:00,714
Don't know when we will be
able to come again.

580
01:48:00,784 --> 01:48:11,558
Trying not to remember
and forget...

581
01:48:12,762 --> 01:48:17,529
...how stupid my heart is.

582
01:48:17,601 --> 01:48:27,476
In these few days, I have
made so many relations.

583
01:49:12,189 --> 01:49:16,990
Meeting and parting
is the tradition

584
01:49:23,900 --> 01:49:33,673
This is victory & this is defeat.
And this is what love is.

585
01:49:35,445 --> 01:49:39,541
This also is my last song.

586
01:49:39,616 --> 01:49:47,785
I don't know how many hearts
I've broken with this decision

587
01:49:49,793 --> 01:49:55,163
There are only a few days
left for our union

588
01:50:54,024 --> 01:50:58,859
The traditions of the world
are like this

589
01:51:04,801 --> 01:51:09,135
All the bondages are
like dreams

590
01:51:11,374 --> 01:51:14,537
Although the heart bears
all the sorrows...

591
01:51:15,779 --> 01:51:20,375
How can one hold his tears

592
01:51:21,551 --> 01:51:26,181
When the father sends his
daughter away as a bride

593
01:51:37,901 --> 01:51:41,098
And the daughter leaves
her father's house

594
01:52:44,501 --> 01:52:47,470
It's our honeymoon today.
What are you thinking?

595
01:52:51,074 --> 01:52:54,168
Why are you looking so sad?

596
01:53:00,517 --> 01:53:09,016
Look into my eyes Sona,
Whom do you see? - Me.

597
01:53:10,527 --> 01:53:18,957
You will always remain in these
eyes, till they close forever.

598
01:53:21,805 --> 01:53:23,932
Don't say these
inauspicious things.

599
01:53:27,944 --> 01:53:31,038
Then why don't you
speak something auspicious?

600
01:53:33,650 --> 01:53:34,582
What?

601
01:53:51,100 --> 01:53:53,432
Are you annoyed? - Will
you try to appease me?

602
01:54:26,569 --> 01:54:27,593
Where is my brother in law?

603
01:54:27,670 --> 01:54:29,831
Come fast, I'm very hungry.

604
01:54:31,674 --> 01:54:35,906
There was a call from Delhi, I'll
have to leave by today's flight.

605
01:54:35,979 --> 01:54:39,847
What's the hurry? Next week
we'll go together, I also have...

606
01:54:39,916 --> 01:54:42,714
...to go to Delhi, in connection
with the new factory work

607
01:54:42,785 --> 01:54:44,377
No brother, it's very importent
for me to go. Vinney'll stay back

608
01:54:46,556 --> 01:54:47,682
Where is Vinney?

609
01:54:47,757 --> 01:54:50,521
I was trying to comfort your
niece. She won't stop crying.

610
01:54:50,593 --> 01:54:52,720
Like mother like daughter.

611
01:54:52,795 --> 01:54:54,626
Even I used to take you in my
laps to comfort you.

612
01:54:54,697 --> 01:54:57,894
So even now, do it for me.

613
01:55:00,837 --> 01:55:05,831
I'm very hungry. Oh great!
Dal and Kashmiri Pulao.

614
01:55:05,909 --> 01:55:10,710
That's the reason I made it.
- They are nicely cooked too.

615
01:55:11,581 --> 01:55:13,208
I'll come to know only
after eating it.

616
01:55:13,449 --> 01:55:15,849
Give her to me,
and you please eat.

617
01:55:15,919 --> 01:55:21,016
I've become a maternal
grandmother, now I want...

618
01:55:21,090 --> 01:55:22,819
...to be a paternal
grandmother too.

619
01:55:25,895 --> 01:55:27,988
Since the day my daughter in law
entered this house, this house...

620
01:55:28,064 --> 01:55:31,500
...has turned into heaven. Thank
god, that unforunate girl...

621
01:55:31,568 --> 01:55:33,001
...did not enter this house.

622
01:55:38,841 --> 01:55:43,801
What happened? At least eat
properly. - No, I'm not hungry.

623
01:56:50,446 --> 01:56:52,380
May be he will come to his
senses for a few moments

624
01:56:52,448 --> 01:56:57,613
All the possible treatments have
been tried. Now there is no...

625
01:56:57,687 --> 01:56:59,450
...chance of his recovery

626
01:57:36,626 --> 01:57:41,529
Shobha, -Don't speak, the
doctor has told you to take rest.

627
01:57:48,638 --> 01:57:57,444
There is no need to cry for a
person like me, I've made you...

628
01:57:57,513 --> 01:58:10,119
...cry a lot. I've given you
a lot of pain. I'm such a...

629
01:58:10,193 --> 01:58:20,535
...unlucky person that I won't be
alive even to see my child

630
01:58:24,841 --> 01:58:35,410
Shobha, bring up the child
in your way

631
01:58:38,454 --> 01:58:47,761
In such a way that his good
deeds will...

632
01:58:49,432 --> 01:58:55,166
...wash away my bad deeds

633
01:58:59,809 --> 01:59:11,550
I've given you a lot of pain.
This is my last wish,

634
01:59:23,566 --> 01:59:24,089
No.

635
01:59:33,843 --> 01:59:36,744
Hello Brother.
- Hello.

636
01:59:36,813 --> 01:59:39,111
I was waiting for you since last
week. - I was busy with the...

637
01:59:39,348 --> 01:59:40,679
...work for the factory so I
couldn't make it.

638
01:59:40,750 --> 01:59:43,776
The work I'd come to do is over,
but it was necessary to meet...

639
01:59:43,853 --> 01:59:47,448
...you or else Vinney would
have killed me. - Have a sit.

640
01:59:54,764 --> 01:59:57,062
What's wrong? Is everything
all right -Why?

641
01:59:57,133 --> 02:00:06,405
You look very upset. - Yes, my
ex-boss J. K expired, today was...

642
02:00:06,475 --> 02:00:09,035
...his funeral, I'm just
returning from there.

643
02:00:09,111 --> 02:00:13,946
There were no chances of his
recovery. But I feel sad for...

644
02:00:14,016 --> 02:00:16,007
...the bad luck of Shobha

645
02:00:17,587 --> 02:00:21,023
Bad luck? You should say it's
her good fortune

646
02:00:21,090 --> 02:00:25,686
All of a sudden she has got the
the property of J.K. Which was...

647
02:00:25,761 --> 02:00:31,666
...her dream. - Brother. Thinking
about her in this manner is a sin

648
02:00:34,937 --> 02:00:40,807
Rakesh, no one knows Shobha
better than me. If Vinney would...

649
02:00:40,877 --> 02:00:45,974
...have deserted you and married
someone else then you would...

650
02:00:46,048 --> 02:00:48,573
...have understood how difficult
it is to control one's emotions...

651
02:00:48,651 --> 02:00:51,142
...after one's heart
gets broken.

652
02:00:53,789 --> 02:00:58,351
Shobha betrayed me and God
punished her. - Stop it brother.

653
02:00:58,427 --> 02:01:02,386
You have some misunderstanding.
We had promised Shobhaji, and...

654
02:01:02,465 --> 02:01:07,402
...hence kept quiet. But to change
your attitude towards her...

655
02:01:07,470 --> 02:01:09,802
...I won't remain quiet today.

656
02:01:09,872 --> 02:01:17,438
Vinney and my love was pure and
true. But one day we became...

657
02:01:17,513 --> 02:01:22,576
...emotional and then we
committed a sin. We realised...

658
02:01:22,652 --> 02:01:26,520
...our mistake when Vinney told
that she was pregnant.

659
02:01:30,660 --> 02:01:33,959
I was ready to marry her at the
same instance, but you were...

660
02:01:34,030 --> 02:01:38,558
...in Germany, and we couldn't
tell this to mother.

661
02:01:40,503 --> 02:01:43,063
J.K. Kidnapped me with the help
of some goons, because he...

662
02:01:43,139 --> 02:01:47,872
...wanted to take revenge on
Shobhaji at any cost.

663
02:01:47,944 --> 02:01:53,177
Shobhaji met him, but he made a
deal that she should marry him...

664
02:01:53,416 --> 02:01:57,785
...immediately or else he won't
allow us to marry.

665
02:02:01,691 --> 02:02:04,751
In this situation, to save the
pride of your family and...

666
02:02:04,827 --> 02:02:09,230
...for my sake & Vinney's, she
deliberately strangled her love...

667
02:02:09,465 --> 02:02:16,496
...and set foot in J. K's trap.

668
02:02:18,741 --> 02:02:21,938
Not just that, people started
blaming her for getting married...

669
02:02:22,011 --> 02:02:25,037
...to J.k. For his money.
But this is not true.

670
02:02:27,483 --> 02:02:30,008
She transferred the money to
J.K.'s younger brother.

671
02:02:30,086 --> 02:02:35,615
And she left for her mother's
place. Brother, I beg to you...

672
02:02:35,691 --> 02:02:39,491
...please don't have a wrong
opinion for Shobhaji

673
02:03:03,119 --> 02:03:06,680
Hello mother. - You?
- May I talk to Shobha?

674
02:03:06,756 --> 02:03:11,125
Do you know about her
husband's death? - Yes.

675
02:03:11,193 --> 02:03:16,529
What will she speak in this
state of mind? -I'll talk to her.

676
02:03:17,600 --> 02:03:19,568
What do you want to talk?

677
02:03:43,125 --> 02:03:52,761
Shobha, I feel sorry for J.K.
- What was meant to happen...

678
02:03:52,835 --> 02:03:59,741
...has happened, but the tragedy
is that he couldn't see his child

679
02:04:09,418 --> 02:04:14,515
Shobha, I'm here to beg
forgivance -For what?

680
02:04:18,227 --> 02:04:29,866
For blaming you, cursing you, for
thinking so wrong & hating you

681
02:04:29,939 --> 02:04:41,783
I should be sorry, I betrayed you
& married someone for his money

682
02:04:46,655 --> 02:04:51,558
Shobha, I met Rakesh in Delhi
and he told me everything.

683
02:04:52,928 --> 02:04:56,921
Rakesh? I had taken a
promise from him.

684
02:04:58,968 --> 02:05:04,065
This was unfair for me. I would
have already misunderstood you.

685
02:05:06,609 --> 02:05:09,544
That would have been good, for
the whole life you would have...

686
02:05:09,612 --> 02:05:14,982
...cursed me and I'd have always
loved you in my mind.

687
02:05:16,952 --> 02:05:22,185
Shobha. - The body is in our
control but not the mind.

688
02:05:22,424 --> 02:05:26,918
Now we are the two banks of
same river which'll never meet.

689
02:05:26,996 --> 02:05:29,362
What do you want to say?

690
02:05:33,068 --> 02:05:40,736
If by any means, at any time I
can help you I'll feel that I've...

691
02:05:40,809 --> 02:05:46,941
...repented for what I
thought of you to be till now.

692
02:05:49,451 --> 02:05:54,445
I'll leave. - Should I say
something? - What?

693
02:05:54,523 --> 02:06:03,124
Don't ever come here, and don't
try to meet me, you'r married...

694
02:06:03,199 --> 02:06:10,833
...now. With Sona, your life is
full of joy, I don't want even...

695
02:06:10,906 --> 02:06:14,740
...the shadow of my bad
luck fall on your life.

696
02:06:18,480 --> 02:06:22,416
Now you must go. Sona
must be waiting for you.

697
02:06:57,486 --> 02:07:00,887
You came without notifying me
- My work got over early, so I...

698
02:07:00,956 --> 02:07:03,390
...took the first
flight and came here.

699
02:07:03,459 --> 02:07:08,055
Did everything go well? - Yes,
the factory will start soon.

700
02:07:08,130 --> 02:07:12,533
So why are you so sad, you
should be happy!

701
02:07:12,601 --> 02:07:18,005
I had to work really hard in
Delhi, so I'm a little tired.

702
02:07:20,142 --> 02:07:23,543
Eat something, and then take
some rest. Come on.

703
02:07:32,421 --> 02:07:36,152
Hello, sister in law.
- Hello. Is Anil there?

704
02:07:36,392 --> 02:07:38,383
He's gone to Bombay hospital.
- Bombay hospital? For what?

705
02:07:38,460 --> 02:07:43,591
A factory worker was a little
injured, he's gone to meet him.

706
02:07:45,734 --> 02:07:49,170
Any special message?
- No. I had casually called up.

707
02:07:57,780 --> 02:08:00,180
Is the worker severely injured?
- Which worker?

708
02:08:00,416 --> 02:08:04,477
I had called up at the office,
Ashok brother said that some...

709
02:08:04,553 --> 02:08:07,454
...worker was injured and so you
had gone to meet him at the...

710
02:08:07,523 --> 02:08:10,856
...Hospital. - That? Nothing much.

711
02:08:10,926 --> 02:08:13,827
He'd burnt his hand, he'll get
well soon.

712
02:08:23,505 --> 02:08:26,406
Are you hiding something from
me? - What do you mean?

713
02:08:28,711 --> 02:08:33,739
A wife can read her husband's
face like a book. My mind says...

714
02:08:33,816 --> 02:08:36,751
...that you are surely hiding
something from me.

715
02:08:41,890 --> 02:08:49,126
You are right. I shouldn't hide
anything from you. Shobha is ill...

716
02:08:49,365 --> 02:08:52,926
...I had gone to meet her.

717
02:08:59,808 --> 02:09:04,370
This means that you still have a
place for Shobha in your mind?

718
02:09:04,446 --> 02:09:11,443
Yes. I do have that place for her
which is there for a goddess.

719
02:09:16,125 --> 02:09:23,861
Which has a higher authority
than a wife? May I ask why...

720
02:09:23,932 --> 02:09:26,526
...and when did this
place get created?

721
02:09:26,602 --> 02:09:32,802
Don't ask me this, I would only
say that from the moment we...

722
02:09:32,875 --> 02:09:42,546
...got married I'm only yours and
will always remain till death.

723
02:10:14,817 --> 02:10:18,844
You've provided me with all
kinds of facilities then what...

724
02:10:18,921 --> 02:10:24,826
...reason brings you here? - There
are some things which don't...

725
02:10:24,893 --> 02:10:28,659
...have any reason. Somethings
just have to happen, like...

726
02:10:28,730 --> 02:10:33,030
...the love between us.

727
02:10:35,704 --> 02:10:39,470
That's all over now. - Tell me
one thing. Don't you remember...

728
02:10:39,541 --> 02:10:53,080
...those days? - I do. But what's
the use of all that? Whenever I...

729
02:10:53,155 --> 02:11:02,530
...see the sunset I think that
it has set and it's dark now.

730
02:11:06,735 --> 02:11:11,798
Shobha. - Anil, love never dies.
It has to be killed by killing...

731
02:11:11,874 --> 02:11:20,680
...our dreams and ambitions.
- Teach me how to kill...

732
02:11:20,749 --> 02:11:31,751
...our dreams and ambitions, I
promise you that I'll forget you.

733
02:11:35,163 --> 02:11:39,532
Why have you come to dig on
same old hurt which can't be...

734
02:11:39,601 --> 02:11:45,437
...cured. Why have
you come here? Why?

735
02:11:52,714 --> 02:11:58,778
Sona! - Sona? Where is she?
- She's gone. The thing, that I...

736
02:11:58,854 --> 02:12:01,687
...dreaded the most has
happened. You immediately go...

737
02:12:01,757 --> 02:12:06,751
...home and plead her. Seeing us
so close, she shouldn't...

738
02:12:06,828 --> 02:12:10,161
...misunderstand us. I don't want
to ruin both your happiness.

739
02:12:13,535 --> 02:12:18,063
Promise me before leaving that
you won't meet me again.

740
02:12:18,140 --> 02:12:20,540
This should be our last meeting.

741
02:12:22,878 --> 02:12:26,473
Till the time you are in the
hospital, I'll come to meet you.

742
02:12:26,548 --> 02:12:35,547
No one can stop me. The moment
you get cured I won't meet you...

743
02:12:35,624 --> 02:12:42,052
...again, this is my promise.

744
02:13:04,886 --> 02:13:10,051
Has Sona returned? - No. Why do
you ask? - Shobha is sick.

745
02:13:10,125 --> 02:13:13,526
I had gone to meet her. Sona
suddenly came there and went...

746
02:13:13,595 --> 02:13:15,756
...away quite suddenly. - But what
do you've to do with that witch

747
02:13:15,831 --> 02:13:17,856
Mother please stop this.

748
02:13:24,906 --> 02:13:28,774
What? Sona's accident? I'll reach
there immediatly.

749
02:13:39,488 --> 02:13:41,683
Did you check the Blood Pressure
- Yes Sir.

750
02:13:44,493 --> 02:13:46,893
Anil, you can take your mother
home. It's not good to stay...

751
02:13:46,962 --> 02:13:48,953
...with the patient right now.

752
02:14:05,714 --> 02:14:07,011
How are you, Sona?

753
02:14:10,185 --> 02:14:14,588
I'm fine... but...

754
02:14:17,592 --> 02:14:20,652
Don't worry, god will once again
fill your lap with a child.

755
02:15:07,476 --> 02:15:09,774
Hello Shobhaji.
- Hello.

756
02:15:09,845 --> 02:15:12,040
I had some urgent work so I had
gone to Delhi. So I couldn't...

757
02:15:12,114 --> 02:15:15,845
...come to meet you. How's the
baby? How is your mother?

758
02:15:21,022 --> 02:15:24,014
When did this happen?
- Five days have passed

759
02:15:26,928 --> 02:15:34,130
God is testiing me to see how
long can I bear the sufferings

760
02:15:38,406 --> 02:15:50,443
Now I'm all alone. I don't want
to remain alive. But still I'll...

761
02:15:50,519 --> 02:15:55,684
...have to live for my baby,
I'll have to,

762
02:16:13,608 --> 02:16:18,807
One doctor is happy till the time
when he can say that his...

763
02:16:18,880 --> 02:16:24,819
...patient is all right. But Some
times it's not the case.

764
02:16:28,089 --> 02:16:32,890
What do you mean?
- Your wife is physically fit, but...

765
02:16:32,961 --> 02:16:36,158
...she can never become
a mother again.

766
02:16:36,398 --> 02:16:38,889
No doctor.

767
02:16:54,883 --> 02:16:59,820
Don't cry daughter.
- Mother you had blessed me...

768
02:16:59,888 --> 02:17:08,660
...for a child. I wanted to give
you a boy who would grace...

769
02:17:08,730 --> 02:17:13,758
...this family when he will grow
up. But due to me, your...

770
02:17:13,835 --> 02:17:15,996
...family won't get a child.

771
02:17:18,974 --> 02:17:25,743
If I cannot be a mother what
will I do by living, I should've...

772
02:17:25,814 --> 02:17:29,409
...died in that accident itself.

773
02:17:29,484 --> 02:17:30,917
Don't cry.

774
02:17:33,588 --> 02:17:39,493
A child is a God's gift, you can't
have a say in front of him.

775
02:17:39,561 --> 02:17:44,498
You should not be cursing
yourself. It's not your fault.

776
02:17:44,566 --> 02:17:48,696
It's the fault of that unfateful
lady who ruined your life and...

777
02:17:48,770 --> 02:17:52,467
...now my daughter-in -law's
life too. - Mother.

778
02:17:52,540 --> 02:17:57,705
It's all your fault. She married
someone else for money and yet...

779
02:17:57,779 --> 02:18:02,682
...your eyes have not opened.
Couldn't you control? - Stop it

780
02:18:02,751 --> 02:18:08,417
I won't stop today. My mind is
in flames. You have got a wife...

781
02:18:08,490 --> 02:18:14,053
...like Sona yet you went to meet
her. Sona woulden't have met...

782
02:18:14,129 --> 02:18:16,154
...with the accident if you never
went to meet her. - Stop it.

783
02:18:16,398 --> 02:18:19,390
You don't know the reality. You
are blaming the one whom we...

784
02:18:19,467 --> 02:18:24,427
...should have worshipped.
- Worshiping that rascal?

785
02:18:26,074 --> 02:18:31,535
Mother you have forced me to
reveal the truth.

786
02:18:35,083 --> 02:18:39,918
This girl, your daughter and my
sister. Ask her what Shobha...

787
02:18:39,988 --> 02:18:42,479
...has done to save the
pride of our family.

788
02:18:47,128 --> 02:18:52,088
She was pregnant,
before marriage.

789
02:18:55,437 --> 02:18:57,098
I had done a mistake, mother.

790
02:18:59,507 --> 02:19:05,935
If that mistake was not covered
up, it would've disgraced us.

791
02:19:06,014 --> 02:19:09,814
If Shobha wouldn't have married
J.K. Vinney and Rakesh wouldn't...

792
02:19:09,884 --> 02:19:11,852
...have got married.
- But why?

793
02:19:11,920 --> 02:19:17,586
Since, Shobha had insuted J.K. He
wanted to take revange, after...

794
02:19:17,659 --> 02:19:25,464
...marriage he has harrased her a
lot. She has gone through a lot.

795
02:19:25,533 --> 02:19:30,800
And this, she has done just for
your sake, to save your pride.

796
02:19:35,076 --> 02:19:42,642
And I have always thought
wrong about her, and blamed her

797
02:19:44,419 --> 02:19:52,019
I was wrong. I've committed a
crime. God shouldn't forgive me.

798
02:19:55,964 --> 02:20:01,869
But I've done a sin, and you
were punished for it. - Mother,

799
02:20:01,936 --> 02:20:03,665
Don't say this, mother.

800
02:20:06,875 --> 02:20:12,438
You? -The one who has
commited sin in his previous life...

801
02:20:12,514 --> 02:20:22,014
...or one who's born at a wrong
time is only punished. Like me.

802
02:20:23,391 --> 02:20:27,418
Shobha. - Once you wanted to
make me your daughter in law

803
02:20:33,868 --> 02:20:37,634
And I have always considered
this to be my home

804
02:20:37,705 --> 02:20:47,103
I had never thought in my
dreams that someone...

805
02:20:47,348 --> 02:20:50,545
...will suffer because of me.

806
02:20:54,389 --> 02:21:04,526
In one way I'm responsible
for what Sona has faced.

807
02:21:06,134 --> 02:21:11,697
No Shobha, don't say this. Today
only we come to know as to...

808
02:21:11,773 --> 02:21:16,767
...what sacrifice you have made
to save the name of our family.

809
02:21:19,180 --> 02:21:20,841
That was my duty, mother.

810
02:21:23,017 --> 02:21:28,785
That too had some flaws. I've
asked for a few moments from...

811
02:21:28,857 --> 02:21:38,698
...life and came to correct
them. -Daughter. - Shobha.

812
02:21:44,672 --> 02:21:53,842
Just one string of delusion is
left, that I want to get rid of.

813
02:22:07,228 --> 02:22:13,895
Please make him yours, sister.
- Shobha. - Treat him as your son

814
02:22:13,968 --> 02:22:18,928
What are you saying? How can
one mother give her child to...

815
02:22:19,007 --> 02:22:21,532
...another women.

816
02:22:21,609 --> 02:22:28,412
How could she be a another
woman? Sona is Anil's wife...

817
02:22:30,118 --> 02:22:31,176
...and your daughter in law.

818
02:22:33,188 --> 02:22:42,460
I'm a widow and in spite of my
bad fate, I can make a married...

819
02:22:42,530 --> 02:22:47,866
...woman happy I'll think my
life to be successful.

820
02:22:53,107 --> 02:23:02,038
Sona, I'm handing him over to
you, please make him yours.

821
02:24:08,182 --> 02:24:10,446
Call some doctor.

822
02:24:13,788 --> 02:24:18,555
No, I've spent so much time, that
no one can do anything now.

823
02:24:25,066 --> 02:24:33,701
If knowingly or unknowingly I've
done any mistake, forgive me.

824
02:24:37,679 --> 02:24:49,420
I've a last wish, make this
baby like you.

825
02:24:55,930 --> 02:25:00,958
All the bad fortune has been
washed away in a moment.

826
02:25:02,770 --> 02:25:03,930
Shobha!
