1
00:00:15,227 --> 00:00:17,692
'COVID-19 has caused
chaos throughout the world.'

2
00:00:18,816 --> 00:00:23,313
'The world is trying to emerge from this
pandemic when a new rumour is rife.'

3
00:00:24,394 --> 00:00:29,183
'A more deadly virus has begun to spread
on the border of India and China.'

4
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,599
'China has denied all claims'

5
00:00:33,173 --> 00:00:34,946
'and their secret agency MSS '

6
00:00:35,026 --> 00:00:38,016
'is trying their best to
keep this news from the world.'

7
00:00:38,589 --> 00:00:42,049
'Against the constraints of time,
our undercover agent Biren Ghosh'

8
00:00:42,129 --> 00:00:44,351
'has managed to establish
communication with a Chinese source.'

9
00:00:45,108 --> 00:00:49,519
'And he's prepared to show evidence
at the conference being held In London,'

10
00:00:50,005 --> 00:00:52,124
'exactly seven days from now.'

11
00:01:02,794 --> 00:01:05,107
Are you okay?
Has Ruhi returned from school?

12
00:01:06,054 --> 00:01:08,606
No, it's nothing. Just checking.

13
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:11,805
I've to go to meet Uma.
To plan the exhibition.

14
00:01:12,177 --> 00:01:13,578
Then straight home from there.

15
00:01:14,913 --> 00:01:16,383
Yes...

16
00:01:17,214 --> 00:01:19,160
No, I am listening. Sorry.

17
00:01:22,412 --> 00:01:24,211
I've a weird feeling.

18
00:01:25,482 --> 00:01:27,203
Like someone's watching me.

19
00:01:30,092 --> 00:01:32,583
Listen, if my phone's
unreachable then call Uma.

20
00:01:42,627 --> 00:01:45,118
Listen. Trust only Uma.

21
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:47,913
No. No need to worry.

22
00:01:47,993 --> 00:01:49,083
It just feeling.

23
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,390
I'm hanging up now.

24
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:51,684
Bye. Love you.

25
00:04:15,783 --> 00:04:20,073
Tell us who is your contact
in the Chinese Delegation.

26
00:04:23,048 --> 00:04:25,850
Who else in your RAW unit
knows about this?

27
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:33,698
Hold on, we can't leave any traces.

28
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:35,624
We're not doing that.

29
00:04:35,704 --> 00:04:38,616
Come on, this birdy needs to sing!

30
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,484
Sing!!

31
00:04:50,394 --> 00:04:51,672
- Did you find anything?
- No.

32
00:04:52,462 --> 00:04:53,737
The confrence is just a few days away.

33
00:04:57,262 --> 00:04:58,613
Any progress in Beijing?

34
00:04:59,381 --> 00:05:00,635
Nothing yet.

35
00:05:09,751 --> 00:05:11,524
Which one of you is betraying us?

36
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:17,898
We need to fish out other RAW agents.

37
00:05:18,668 --> 00:05:19,879
before the delegation arrives.

38
00:05:23,884 --> 00:05:26,383
It's too dangerous.
She is here as a diplomat.

39
00:05:30,173 --> 00:05:33,754
INDIAN EMBASSY LONDON

40
00:05:37,973 --> 00:05:40,524
We chose this room in
the gallery for the exhibition.

41
00:05:41,276 --> 00:05:43,784
Indian Embassy's quite particular
about the style that you...

42
00:05:44,988 --> 00:05:47,375
How long have you been
working for the Indian Embassy?

43
00:05:47,868 --> 00:05:48,914
Three-years. Why?

44
00:05:49,788 --> 00:05:53,299
Your last exhibition with
Biren Ghosh was very-very good.

45
00:05:57,122 --> 00:05:58,705
Did I say something wrong?

46
00:05:59,154 --> 00:06:00,806
No, it's nothing. Thank you.

47
00:06:01,385 --> 00:06:03,071
Actually,
I've complete faith in your taste.

48
00:06:03,151 --> 00:06:04,256
So you can...

49
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,640
Excuse me.

50
00:06:08,347 --> 00:06:09,229
Hello.

51
00:06:10,007 --> 00:06:11,599
I'll call you back in a while.

52
00:06:13,302 --> 00:06:14,539
What happened? What are you looking at?

53
00:06:14,619 --> 00:06:15,352
Nothing.

54
00:06:15,432 --> 00:06:17,281
I was just waiting for
you to come off the phone.

55
00:06:18,362 --> 00:06:21,086
Did you deal with the artist's Visas?

56
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:22,964
We're working on it.

57
00:06:23,344 --> 00:06:24,148
What do you mean?

58
00:06:24,228 --> 00:06:27,123
We're preparing for the
9th Global Conference on Virology.

59
00:06:27,339 --> 00:06:28,852
Mrs. Das has said that's priority.

60
00:06:28,932 --> 00:06:30,020
I know that.

61
00:06:30,228 --> 00:06:32,018
But what are you and Azad been doing?

62
00:06:32,754 --> 00:06:34,226
Everyone's arrived
except for three others.

63
00:06:34,306 --> 00:06:35,740
But don't worry they will be here too.

64
00:06:37,418 --> 00:06:40,038
The best scientists in the
country are attending. No delays.

65
00:06:40,245 --> 00:06:42,338
I understand, ma'am.
The country's reputation is at stake.

66
00:06:42,528 --> 00:06:45,513
And also don't forget to speak about the
party to the Delegation's coordinator.

67
00:06:45,703 --> 00:06:48,176
Ma'am, I've covered everything.
It's all set.

68
00:06:48,626 --> 00:06:50,373
I even had a word with
the classical singers.

69
00:06:52,362 --> 00:06:53,339
Thank you.

70
00:06:54,308 --> 00:06:56,652
Can I talk to you
privately for a second?

71
00:06:58,277 --> 00:07:00,811
If you can tell the
head office for my raise...

72
00:07:05,153 --> 00:07:06,260
Okay.

73
00:07:07,765 --> 00:07:11,631
If you can tell the head office for my
salary raise, then that would be great.

74
00:07:12,037 --> 00:07:13,273
Can I come in?

75
00:07:15,453 --> 00:07:16,715
I've already requested for that.

76
00:07:16,795 --> 00:07:19,985
I know, but it's been a while, and
I am under a lot of financial pressure.

77
00:07:20,322 --> 00:07:21,481
- If you could...
- Ma'am,

78
00:07:22,155 --> 00:07:24,378
no one's following up
with the British Embassy

79
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:26,263
about fast-forwarding
Indian artist's visas.

80
00:07:26,343 --> 00:07:29,308
Because we've only two
people working on the conference.

81
00:07:30,994 --> 00:07:31,997
Azad, thank you.

82
00:07:32,403 --> 00:07:33,900
Close the door on your way out.

83
00:07:35,535 --> 00:07:37,316
But this exhibition is important too.

84
00:07:39,721 --> 00:07:40,975
You worry too much.

85
00:07:42,965 --> 00:07:44,271
Come, sit.

86
00:07:46,527 --> 00:07:47,729
How is the baby?

87
00:07:48,499 --> 00:07:49,493
Everything is fine.

88
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:50,989
How is Sharad?

89
00:07:52,131 --> 00:07:53,073
He's good.

90
00:07:55,893 --> 00:07:57,398
Any lead on Biren Ghosh?

91
00:07:58,549 --> 00:07:59,345
Not yet.

92
00:07:59,425 --> 00:08:00,841
That's not good.

93
00:08:01,031 --> 00:08:03,245
Especially with this
conference coming up.

94
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:04,957
I'll find him.

95
00:08:05,338 --> 00:08:06,670
I know you two are friends.

96
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:09,438
Keep me posted.

97
00:08:16,901 --> 00:08:19,699
Goel wants to talk to you.
He sounds stressed.

98
00:08:19,779 --> 00:08:20,751
I am on my way.

99
00:08:21,394 --> 00:08:23,331
Any lead on Biren's last location?

100
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:26,354
Vauxhall Bus Station. But his
phone's been switched off for 24-hours.

101
00:08:26,434 --> 00:08:27,835
You think it's the Chinese?

102
00:08:28,098 --> 00:08:29,807
MSS is under a lot of pressure.

103
00:08:29,887 --> 00:08:31,073
But we need proof.

104
00:08:31,668 --> 00:08:33,232
London is a city of CCTV.

105
00:08:33,861 --> 00:08:38,358
Access all the footage and find out
where Biren's been in the past few days.

106
00:08:38,593 --> 00:08:41,312
We're scanning the CCTV feeds.
We'll find him soon.

107
00:08:41,392 --> 00:08:42,322
Great.

108
00:08:43,097 --> 00:08:44,529
How did they find out?

109
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,452
6 DAYS TO THE CONFRENCE

110
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,746
We have to reduce supply.

111
00:09:10,002 --> 00:09:10,825
Why?

112
00:09:11,503 --> 00:09:13,420
There is no demand.
Your money is sinking.

113
00:09:14,036 --> 00:09:15,703
Stop worrying about
that and do your job.

114
00:09:16,471 --> 00:09:18,623
If this was my shop,
I would be running it separately.

115
00:09:19,349 --> 00:09:22,062
The only difference being you wore born
with a silver spoon and me in poverty.

116
00:09:25,168 --> 00:09:26,483
So this isn't your shop?

117
00:09:29,098 --> 00:09:30,005
Can I ask you a question?

118
00:09:32,773 --> 00:09:35,444
Do you trust me with Biren?

119
00:09:42,454 --> 00:09:43,353
I checked your mail.

120
00:09:45,595 --> 00:09:46,619
And Mrs. Mehta as well.

121
00:09:48,369 --> 00:09:49,151
Sorry.

122
00:09:50,624 --> 00:09:51,475
It's okay.

123
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:55,372
Shopkeepers like us are
not allowed to get emotional.

124
00:09:57,669 --> 00:09:58,963
I wonder where she is hiding.

125
00:09:59,523 --> 00:10:00,851
Biren was also a friend.

126
00:10:01,086 --> 00:10:02,996
Only Biren knew about the whistleblower.

127
00:10:06,616 --> 00:10:09,197
We've no contact whatsoever
with the whistleblower anymore.

128
00:10:09,885 --> 00:10:11,712
The conference is in a few days.

129
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:14,479
That's why the boss is restless as well.

130
00:10:15,106 --> 00:10:16,208
Let's go take a look.

131
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,809
You carry on, I'll join you.

132
00:10:56,728 --> 00:10:57,679
Hello, sir.

133
00:10:57,831 --> 00:10:59,907
How are you doing, Uma?
Are you taking care of yourself?

134
00:11:00,246 --> 00:11:01,401
Yes, sir. Thank you.

135
00:11:01,574 --> 00:11:02,259
Good.

136
00:11:02,425 --> 00:11:05,760
Now what I want to know is
about Biren's sudden disappearance.

137
00:11:06,023 --> 00:11:07,967
How did his cover get blown?

138
00:11:08,265 --> 00:11:09,240
I don't know yet.

139
00:11:09,558 --> 00:11:12,008
He was heading towards
my home but never made it.

140
00:11:12,658 --> 00:11:14,464
He was going to tell
me about his source.

141
00:11:14,544 --> 00:11:18,138
So Biren's the only one who
knows about our Chinese source?

142
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:20,837
Any leads?

143
00:11:21,474 --> 00:11:23,224
He didn't send any SOS either.

144
00:11:23,376 --> 00:11:27,195
I tried tracing his last known location.
The phone is dead.

145
00:11:27,611 --> 00:11:28,434
Dammit.

146
00:11:29,299 --> 00:11:30,635
Sir, we'll trace him.

147
00:11:30,835 --> 00:11:33,333
But until then what feedback
do you want me to give our bosses?

148
00:11:33,582 --> 00:11:35,903
That the Indian Intelligence
is not intelligent enough

149
00:11:35,983 --> 00:11:37,670
to find their own spy!

150
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:45,108
Sir, I think we've a mole in our ranks.

151
00:11:46,285 --> 00:11:47,447
What are you saying, Uma?

152
00:11:49,004 --> 00:11:51,128
One needs evidence to make such claims.

153
00:11:53,051 --> 00:11:54,428
I have a strong feeling, sir.

154
00:11:55,162 --> 00:11:57,701
Your job doesn't function
solely on instincts.

155
00:12:00,054 --> 00:12:01,361
Having said that

156
00:12:02,821 --> 00:12:04,011
we can't take any risks.

157
00:12:06,626 --> 00:12:09,297
Okay, look into it.

158
00:12:09,996 --> 00:12:11,338
But be careful.

159
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:13,905
Where is Arjun?

160
00:12:15,683 --> 00:12:16,769
- Hello, sir.
- Arjun.

161
00:12:17,101 --> 00:12:20,353
Okay, look, if the Chinese
found out about our source

162
00:12:20,623 --> 00:12:22,165
then they will definitely kill him.

163
00:12:23,114 --> 00:12:26,843
Then this virus will level
every city it spreads to.

164
00:12:27,286 --> 00:12:28,642
Just find Biren!

165
00:12:30,233 --> 00:12:31,056
We'll find him, sir.

166
00:12:31,347 --> 00:12:33,222
The situation is pretty
stressed at the border, Uma.

167
00:12:33,782 --> 00:12:35,457
We'll all have to be extremely careful.

168
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:39,553
The slightest mistake and
India-China could go to war.

169
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:44,548
Don't do anything to prove
our involvement in any of this.

170
00:12:45,434 --> 00:12:49,232
If anything goes wrong in UK
and MI6 will get directly involved.

171
00:12:49,674 --> 00:12:51,542
So...make no noise.

172
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:54,759
No guns, no fireworks, nothing flashy.

173
00:12:55,624 --> 00:12:58,198
Keep it down. Keep it confidential.

174
00:12:59,118 --> 00:13:00,156
Keep me posted.

175
00:13:07,671 --> 00:13:08,688
I can feel it.

176
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,860
Something doesn't fit.

177
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:16,472
The store above and the
one below both run on feelings.

178
00:13:16,859 --> 00:13:19,274
Shut up, Arjun. Let's get back to work.

179
00:13:19,354 --> 00:13:22,326
Okay.
One missing RAW agent.

180
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:26,166
Another deadly virus.
And now we've a mole among us.

181
00:13:26,892 --> 00:13:27,964
Where do we start?

182
00:13:30,254 --> 00:13:31,610
Got the CCTV.

183
00:13:36,425 --> 00:13:37,940
He's an MSS Agent.

184
00:13:47,074 --> 00:13:49,039
Don't forget to come
to the delegation party.

185
00:13:49,751 --> 00:13:51,446
I can't think about the party right now.

186
00:13:53,341 --> 00:13:58,039
Biren will come back.
We're looking in all the hospitals.

187
00:13:58,884 --> 00:14:00,586
You won't find him in hospitals, Niru.

188
00:14:01,831 --> 00:14:02,979
He's been kidnapped.

189
00:14:03,837 --> 00:14:04,571
What?

190
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:06,916
MSS is involved.

191
00:14:08,328 --> 00:14:09,781
MSS in London.

192
00:14:10,999 --> 00:14:11,926
I don't understand.

193
00:14:17,205 --> 00:14:18,028
What is this?

194
00:14:18,436 --> 00:14:20,076
Evidence of MSS's involvement.

195
00:14:21,273 --> 00:14:22,560
He doesn't have too long, Niru.

196
00:14:23,024 --> 00:14:24,075
We have to help him.

197
00:14:25,065 --> 00:14:26,262
I won't let them get away.

198
00:14:27,044 --> 00:14:27,846
Thank you.

199
00:14:31,515 --> 00:14:32,685
BIREN'S RESIDENCE

200
00:14:33,548 --> 00:14:35,340
Ruhi didn't even want to go to school.

201
00:14:36,489 --> 00:14:37,839
Biren's never done this.

202
00:14:38,814 --> 00:14:40,745
He's never ever been an hour
late without informing in prior.

203
00:14:44,142 --> 00:14:46,017
When did you two talk for the last time?

204
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,684
He called me after leaving from work.

205
00:14:48,099 --> 00:14:49,164
He was on his way to see you.

206
00:14:51,862 --> 00:14:53,675
Did he leave a message
for me on the phone?

207
00:14:54,843 --> 00:14:56,130
No, but...

208
00:14:57,465 --> 00:14:59,022
He brought something for you yesterday.

209
00:15:00,856 --> 00:15:01,748
It's a painting.

210
00:15:04,049 --> 00:15:05,649
He trusted you a lot.

211
00:15:06,876 --> 00:15:08,597
Don't worry. I will find him.

212
00:15:09,143 --> 00:15:11,746
That summer in Beijing was the worst.

213
00:15:12,066 --> 00:15:14,782
Every day I used to wake
up with a different problem.

214
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:18,189
Each time worse than before.

215
00:15:18,828 --> 00:15:21,285
- Was Tara with you at that time?
- Yes.

216
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,464
I remember your wedding in Bali.

217
00:15:23,749 --> 00:15:25,167
You served Chinese food,

218
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,771
but there was nothing Chinese in that.

219
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,069
Our country is a huge melting pot.

220
00:15:41,704 --> 00:15:43,183
But we also know

221
00:15:44,662 --> 00:15:47,343
how to fight for the
safety of our interest.

222
00:15:48,727 --> 00:15:52,049
What is it that you're
actually implying, Ambassador.

223
00:15:53,709 --> 00:15:55,110
Where is Biren Ghosh?

224
00:15:56,338 --> 00:15:57,384
Who?

225
00:15:58,336 --> 00:15:59,451
The art collector.

226
00:15:59,754 --> 00:16:02,193
I've no idea what you're talking about.

227
00:16:11,099 --> 00:16:12,336
What's that?

228
00:16:13,356 --> 00:16:15,449
Evidence of MSS involvement.

229
00:16:19,904 --> 00:16:21,607
Would you like some more wine?

230
00:16:22,671 --> 00:16:23,752
No, thank you.

231
00:16:25,508 --> 00:16:26,589
Yes, please.

232
00:16:31,734 --> 00:16:36,611
I've heard times one Chinese
does a crime you'll blame us.

233
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:39,336
You can't take this seriously.

234
00:16:41,308 --> 00:16:43,565
There is going to be
more evidence coming up.

235
00:16:44,119 --> 00:16:47,379
I mean it for your own
credibility and that of China,

236
00:16:48,512 --> 00:16:50,077
Release Biren now.

237
00:16:53,796 --> 00:16:55,068
I mean it as a friend.

238
00:17:02,747 --> 00:17:07,418
With the Global Convention
so close all ayes are on us.

239
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:15,149
I can not have any dirt flung
at us right now! Do you understand?

240
00:17:17,744 --> 00:17:19,067
Calm down.

241
00:17:20,234 --> 00:17:21,635
I'll manage this.

242
00:17:26,081 --> 00:17:28,338
If they get to the source before us

243
00:17:28,779 --> 00:17:30,422
there will be a huge misunderstanding.

244
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:35,274
This kind of misunderstanding.

245
00:17:36,442 --> 00:17:38,561
will lead to war between both countries.

246
00:17:44,144 --> 00:17:46,455
UMA'S RESIDENCE

247
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:49,199
The weather is pretty nice today.
I really missed you.

248
00:17:49,675 --> 00:17:50,972
I wish you were here.

249
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,608
By the way, you're glowing so much.

250
00:17:55,688 --> 00:17:59,534
In fact, I had to reduce the brightness
of my iPad because of your glow.

251
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:04,757
Anyway, did you think about ultrasound?

252
00:18:07,316 --> 00:18:08,268
Uma.

253
00:18:08,985 --> 00:18:13,448
Look, what you're doing is
more important, so finish that first.

254
00:18:13,629 --> 00:18:15,774
- I'll call you later, okay.
- No, listen.

255
00:18:16,579 --> 00:18:19,329
Honestly, I don't want to find
out whether it's a girl or a boy.

256
00:18:19,553 --> 00:18:20,461
Why?

257
00:18:20,643 --> 00:18:23,549
Imagine if it's a girl
like you always wanted.

258
00:18:23,766 --> 00:18:24,994
And what if it's not?

259
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,664
Let's drop this topic.
When are you coming back?

260
00:18:33,747 --> 00:18:35,667
Baby, I am trying
to make a conversation.

261
00:18:35,943 --> 00:18:37,171
Please, be with me.

262
00:18:37,897 --> 00:18:39,929
Okay, okay, I am with you.
Go on.

263
00:18:41,229 --> 00:18:44,488
It's come to this that
to grab my wife's attention

264
00:18:44,868 --> 00:18:46,798
I'll have to talk in code. Right?

265
00:18:51,701 --> 00:18:53,111
I haven't decided on a date yet.

266
00:18:53,266 --> 00:18:54,918
Baby, let's talk tomorrow.

267
00:18:55,921 --> 00:18:57,642
Okay, fine. Do call me.

268
00:19:06,975 --> 00:19:08,912
Biren, why did you
give me this painting?

269
00:19:31,547 --> 00:19:34,695
5 DAYS TO THE CONFRENCE

270
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,118
Hi. You drove in.

271
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:46,371
Yeah. But don't worry,
I made sure no one was following me.

272
00:19:46,855 --> 00:19:48,031
I trust you.

273
00:19:48,593 --> 00:19:49,743
Are you okay, Uma?

274
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:51,750
Have you been crying?

275
00:19:52,823 --> 00:19:53,947
Biren is dead.

276
00:19:54,855 --> 00:19:55,928
What?

277
00:19:58,099 --> 00:19:59,534
They pulled his body out...

278
00:20:01,247 --> 00:20:03,297
They pulled his body
out of Thames last night.

279
00:20:04,378 --> 00:20:05,286
Oh no!

280
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,115
Nirupama and Wong met
at the restaurant yesterday.

281
00:20:14,851 --> 00:20:16,096
He didn't like her claims.

282
00:20:17,194 --> 00:20:19,997
I think they released his
body after Niru showed them evidence.

283
00:20:24,563 --> 00:20:25,714
That's him.

284
00:20:27,807 --> 00:20:29,511
Don't worry, I'll find him.

285
00:20:31,085 --> 00:20:32,927
You're in a very dangerous place, Yuki.

286
00:20:33,221 --> 00:20:35,531
You've to be careful
of every step that you take.

287
00:20:35,971 --> 00:20:37,009
Always.

288
00:20:38,531 --> 00:20:39,725
What about our source?

289
00:20:40,468 --> 00:20:41,947
Only Biren knew of him.

290
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,170
He didn't even risk telling me.

291
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:45,952
You should not give up.

292
00:20:46,817 --> 00:20:47,829
Never!

293
00:20:48,598 --> 00:20:49,887
I owe that to him!

294
00:20:50,813 --> 00:20:51,842
You take care.

295
00:20:56,893 --> 00:21:00,242
If Biren ran the virus
intel through Goel

296
00:21:00,322 --> 00:21:02,236
then it definitely went
through embassy channels.

297
00:21:04,002 --> 00:21:05,905
There couldn't be another way.

298
00:21:06,684 --> 00:21:09,365
So the mole could be among
us or in the Indian Embassy.

299
00:21:09,572 --> 00:21:13,801
Even Biren's immigration
paper works were urgently processed.

300
00:21:14,475 --> 00:21:18,203
And Jeevan and Azad
processed those papers.

301
00:21:21,021 --> 00:21:22,613
- All done?
- Come on, let's go.

302
00:21:23,512 --> 00:21:24,394
Sir.

303
00:21:54,515 --> 00:21:56,991
Jeevan Bhati. Hails from Udaypur.

304
00:21:57,585 --> 00:21:59,747
Lives with his wife and daughter here.

305
00:22:00,731 --> 00:22:02,536
This is his third posting.

306
00:22:02,979 --> 00:22:06,687
Before this,
he was in Buenos Aires and Nairobi.

307
00:22:08,935 --> 00:22:10,589
We must follow them.

308
00:22:10,762 --> 00:22:12,405
Places they go, things they do...

309
00:22:12,485 --> 00:22:14,686
What they eat, drink everything.

310
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:18,027
- But first India...
- I already checked India.

311
00:22:18,666 --> 00:22:20,125
Check their backgrounds as well.

312
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:03,401
Jeevan's sitting with a friend.

313
00:23:04,731 --> 00:23:06,990
He looks Indian but can't confirm.

314
00:23:08,612 --> 00:23:11,088
'I checked the data
you sent in the database.'

315
00:23:11,877 --> 00:23:13,477
'His name is Nishant Singh.'

316
00:23:13,942 --> 00:23:16,947
'He's doing his PhD in Kings
College in Chinese history.'

317
00:23:18,395 --> 00:23:20,471
'But what is the connection
between Jeevan and him?'

318
00:23:40,112 --> 00:23:40,991
But still.

319
00:23:41,071 --> 00:23:42,783
We'll have to be aware at all times.

320
00:23:43,059 --> 00:23:44,296
You're absolutely right.

321
00:23:44,858 --> 00:23:46,492
COVID has taught us a lot.

322
00:23:53,185 --> 00:23:54,153
Hi, Uma.

323
00:23:56,272 --> 00:23:57,354
All good?

324
00:23:59,265 --> 00:24:02,119
After the news of Biren's death...

325
00:24:04,178 --> 00:24:05,215
I know.

326
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:10,741
I warned Wong.

327
00:24:13,164 --> 00:24:14,593
Do they really believe

328
00:24:15,015 --> 00:24:17,428
they can kidnap an Indian under
broad daylight and kill him?

329
00:24:23,473 --> 00:24:25,488
Niru, I had to speak to you.

330
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:29,216
I think there's a Chinese
informant in our Embassy

331
00:24:29,622 --> 00:24:32,032
- and I've started investigating.
- Meaning?

332
00:24:32,112 --> 00:24:35,762
Meaning I can't get into details
right now, but this is important.

333
00:24:36,162 --> 00:24:37,070
I hope you understand.

334
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:38,926
This should be thoroughly investigated.

335
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:42,420
If you need any support,
then tell me immediately.

336
00:24:42,853 --> 00:24:43,890
Thank you.

337
00:24:45,144 --> 00:24:47,246
D-Day's coming closer.

338
00:24:52,885 --> 00:24:54,580
Is everything alright between you two?

339
00:24:56,422 --> 00:24:58,204
Some relationships don't
come with an expiry date?

340
00:25:00,306 --> 00:25:03,437
Did you decide whether you're
going to deliver it here or India?

341
00:25:03,696 --> 00:25:05,157
I haven't decided that yet.

342
00:25:05,788 --> 00:25:08,945
The child is due in a couple of months,
and you haven't decided yet.

343
00:25:11,653 --> 00:25:12,942
Can I get you something to drink?

344
00:25:13,391 --> 00:25:15,571
Thank you. I'll help myself.

345
00:25:15,864 --> 00:25:16,833
Okay.

346
00:25:32,469 --> 00:25:34,415
You know when I was pregnant with Ishaan

347
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:38,558
I stole food from the
Finance Minister's table.

348
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:41,870
No wonder Ishaan was
born such a healthy boy.

349
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:44,486
I always carry my fuel with me.

350
00:25:44,566 --> 00:25:47,253
Forget it. They are serving
Gouloti Kebabs today. Try them.

351
00:25:47,459 --> 00:25:50,118
I loved the food
prepared by you the most.

352
00:25:54,731 --> 00:25:57,092
I've a great recipe.
I'll forward it to you.

353
00:25:57,731 --> 00:25:58,726
You should try it.

354
00:26:05,248 --> 00:26:06,425
You must follow her.

355
00:26:07,722 --> 00:26:08,595
Excellent.

356
00:26:24,776 --> 00:26:26,912
'Post the party Jeevan
came straight to Mayfair.'

357
00:26:28,149 --> 00:26:31,280
'Met Nishant and they
left together in a cab.'

358
00:26:32,819 --> 00:26:34,514
'Two meetings in a single day.'

359
00:26:36,339 --> 00:26:37,489
'I'll keep an eye on them.'

360
00:27:27,621 --> 00:27:29,761
So how was the party? Was it good?

361
00:27:30,291 --> 00:27:33,858
It was great. But what's even better...

362
00:27:43,199 --> 00:27:45,177
Thank you. Thank you so much.

363
00:27:46,031 --> 00:27:49,015
I just did my job.
But I just did it quickly.

364
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:51,090
For you.

365
00:28:18,172 --> 00:28:19,529
Late on your first day.

366
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:31,743
'I have tracked the
MSS Agent from the hotel.'

367
00:28:33,564 --> 00:28:35,605
'He went to Tai Chi
class near Old Street.'

368
00:28:36,729 --> 00:28:39,998
'Keep a low profile and
report anything suspicious.'

369
00:28:44,149 --> 00:28:46,666
4 DAYS TO THE CONFRENCE

370
00:28:59,285 --> 00:29:01,144
Did you study Biren's report, Uma?

371
00:29:01,326 --> 00:29:02,147
I am just doing that, sir.

372
00:29:02,227 --> 00:29:05,087
We just decrypted the last
message on his cloud backup.

373
00:29:05,167 --> 00:29:08,686
It's a flight number.
SN 2903.

374
00:29:09,162 --> 00:29:11,199
The source is arriving
in London in four days.

375
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:12,218
On the day of the functions.

376
00:29:12,671 --> 00:29:15,206
Maybe the source is
a part of the delegation.

377
00:29:15,467 --> 00:29:19,579
Sir, he won't reveal his intel
until he isn't assured of his safety.

378
00:29:19,659 --> 00:29:21,572
Exactly. Make sure there are no leaks.

379
00:29:21,866 --> 00:29:24,263
If there's a mole and he finds out

380
00:29:24,343 --> 00:29:25,763
then our source will be compromised.

381
00:29:25,843 --> 00:29:26,682
I know, sir.

382
00:29:26,762 --> 00:29:28,199
This is a high priority.

383
00:29:28,929 --> 00:29:30,302
There is no room for any mistake.

384
00:29:31,187 --> 00:29:33,030
I know. I am trying my best, sir.

385
00:29:33,157 --> 00:29:36,229
Don't try, Uma.
You must find the source at any cost.

386
00:29:36,871 --> 00:29:38,498
Did you investigate the Embassy staff?

387
00:29:38,578 --> 00:29:40,900
Yes.
We haven't achieved any results yet.

388
00:29:41,415 --> 00:29:42,428
Just don't blow your cover.

389
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:43,458
Keep me posted.

390
00:29:43,538 --> 00:29:44,349
Yes, sir.

391
00:30:19,674 --> 00:30:20,823
Pause. Pause. Pause.

392
00:30:21,995 --> 00:30:23,671
What did he give Nishant?

393
00:30:27,341 --> 00:30:28,330
Envelope.

394
00:30:30,019 --> 00:30:32,192
Even after all these years, you
don't know how to operate the camera?

395
00:30:32,272 --> 00:30:33,132
What's the problem with this one?

396
00:30:33,212 --> 00:30:34,310
Nothing is visible.

397
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:36,223
- Did you want their closeup?
- Yeah.

398
00:30:36,303 --> 00:30:37,673
Cut it both of you.

399
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,591
Check Nishant's background.

400
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:44,639
Did you find anything
from Jeevan and Azad's data?

401
00:30:44,964 --> 00:30:47,872
Jeevan is clean by
Azad is hiding something.

402
00:30:47,952 --> 00:30:49,126
What?

403
00:30:49,644 --> 00:30:54,044
He's protected his personal
folder with 256-bit encryption.

404
00:30:54,974 --> 00:30:56,628
I'll follow Azad.

405
00:30:59,569 --> 00:31:01,428
Can I get you something to drink?

406
00:31:03,504 --> 00:31:04,639
We've another suspect.

407
00:31:17,978 --> 00:31:18,984
Sharad Datta.

408
00:31:19,064 --> 00:31:20,811
The ambassador husband!

409
00:31:22,237 --> 00:31:24,940
What?
Do we have permission for this?

410
00:31:26,453 --> 00:31:27,805
We'll have to do it under the radar.

411
00:31:28,584 --> 00:31:31,211
It's a bit risky, but it's necessary.

412
00:31:31,946 --> 00:31:33,243
Instinct.

413
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:35,848
He's hiding something. I am sure.

414
00:31:47,432 --> 00:31:48,632
Azad Nair.

415
00:31:49,604 --> 00:31:51,690
Born in Kochi, raised in Kolkata.

416
00:31:51,939 --> 00:31:53,798
London is his 5th posting.

417
00:31:55,442 --> 00:31:59,117
Before this, he's been to Beirut,
Islamabad, Kabul, and Beijing.

418
00:32:00,069 --> 00:32:01,810
Punishment postings one after another.

419
00:32:02,026 --> 00:32:03,464
His family?

420
00:32:04,242 --> 00:32:05,842
He lives alone in London.

421
00:32:06,285 --> 00:32:09,398
He got divorced last years.
Wife got custody of the kids.

422
00:32:11,701 --> 00:32:13,355
He's at a cloth store.

423
00:32:13,733 --> 00:32:15,463
It's just a front for money laundering.

424
00:32:15,895 --> 00:32:17,517
He's sending a lot of money.

425
00:32:18,727 --> 00:32:20,814
- Where are you, boss?
- Nishant's home.

426
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:26,492
[indistinct chatter]

427
00:33:33,567 --> 00:33:35,957
One vodka. One vodka please.

428
00:33:43,308 --> 00:33:44,536
Hello, boss, where are you?

429
00:33:44,718 --> 00:33:46,785
I just left Nishant's home. And you.

430
00:33:47,183 --> 00:33:48,653
You wouldn't want to know.

431
00:33:50,001 --> 00:33:52,102
By the sound of music
seems like you're in some bar.

432
00:33:53,625 --> 00:33:55,043
- Strip club.
- Really.

433
00:33:55,744 --> 00:33:57,984
Do you like to watch
only girls or also boys?

434
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,805
If you don't love me,
then at least think about your family.

435
00:34:03,885 --> 00:34:05,370
It's not what you think.

436
00:34:05,862 --> 00:34:07,791
I know you're meeting someone else.

437
00:34:07,871 --> 00:34:08,812
Sneha.

438
00:34:10,092 --> 00:34:11,407
Control yourself.

439
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:23,368
What's the matter?

440
00:34:24,606 --> 00:34:26,184
You must come with me right now.

441
00:34:26,607 --> 00:34:29,000
No. I am busy.

442
00:34:30,890 --> 00:34:31,945
Emergency!

443
00:34:33,436 --> 00:34:34,218
Shall we?

444
00:35:03,877 --> 00:35:05,261
How long have you known Nishant?

445
00:35:05,866 --> 00:35:07,174
That's my personal matter.

446
00:35:09,586 --> 00:35:12,678
Your relationship with the enemy's
spy cannot be your personal matter.

447
00:35:13,413 --> 00:35:16,483
And what if your wife and kids
find out about this personal matter?

448
00:35:16,563 --> 00:35:18,246
Are you blackmailing me?

449
00:35:18,905 --> 00:35:19,964
No.

450
00:35:20,483 --> 00:35:23,089
I just want to know what
information you gave him?

451
00:35:23,456 --> 00:35:24,905
It's a matter of National Security.

452
00:35:26,883 --> 00:35:29,207
Your sexual choices
are of no importance to me.

453
00:35:30,483 --> 00:35:32,169
Please don't harm him.

454
00:35:36,321 --> 00:35:39,327
Nishant escaped from his flat today.
Where is he?

455
00:35:41,695 --> 00:35:42,862
I don't know.

456
00:35:47,122 --> 00:35:51,241
Look, I am very irritated
at the moment and short of time.

457
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,851
So please don't test my patience.

458
00:35:52,931 --> 00:35:55,813
I didn't leak any information to him.

459
00:35:55,986 --> 00:35:57,662
What did you give him
in the envelope last night?

460
00:36:04,798 --> 00:36:07,587
I just got his new passport made.

461
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:11,424
He's gay. He didn't want to go back.

462
00:36:12,678 --> 00:36:13,969
I just helped him out.

463
00:36:15,618 --> 00:36:17,715
Are you taking advantage
of him in-exchange of this help?

464
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,462
I love him.

465
00:36:22,461 --> 00:36:24,483
I didn't tell him anything.

466
00:36:29,574 --> 00:36:32,991
Please, don't tell my family.

467
00:37:14,762 --> 00:37:17,025
Hey...

468
00:38:06,149 --> 00:38:07,797
F**k! Call security!

469
00:38:07,877 --> 00:38:11,037
Let's go.
Let's f**k off from here.

470
00:38:24,411 --> 00:38:25,881
What are you wearing?

471
00:38:27,543 --> 00:38:29,809
She's sleeping. Don't worry.

472
00:38:31,072 --> 00:38:32,983
Look, I'll make it up to you.

473
00:38:33,649 --> 00:38:37,854
And I'll make it down to you.

474
00:38:45,397 --> 00:38:47,307
Quite an early morning conversation?

475
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:50,497
Aren't you getting late?

476
00:38:55,335 --> 00:38:56,754
Don't ignore me, Sharad.

477
00:38:58,179 --> 00:38:59,632
Is she that student of yours?

478
00:39:06,912 --> 00:39:08,052
What do you think?

479
00:39:09,129 --> 00:39:11,820
I don't know what you've
been up to for the past two weeks.

480
00:39:12,634 --> 00:39:13,364
Your affair...

481
00:39:13,444 --> 00:39:14,297
I know.

482
00:39:15,693 --> 00:39:17,645
I am the husband of
the Indian Ambassador.

483
00:39:19,291 --> 00:39:20,630
Don't put it like that.

484
00:39:23,347 --> 00:39:25,101
Don't make it so obvious.

485
00:39:26,509 --> 00:39:27,639
It hurts.

486
00:39:33,234 --> 00:39:35,357
Did you forget your Beijing affair?

487
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,872
Why do you keep digging up the past?

488
00:39:48,273 --> 00:39:52,262
Some wounds become worse with time.

489
00:40:06,833 --> 00:40:08,007
Can't we move on?

490
00:40:17,379 --> 00:40:18,888
I would really like to.

491
00:40:19,271 --> 00:40:21,429
But the Niru I loved

492
00:40:22,683 --> 00:40:24,044
my Niru

493
00:40:25,701 --> 00:40:27,560
got lost somewhere in Beijing.

494
00:40:28,686 --> 00:40:30,863
I've already apologised once, Sharad.

495
00:40:32,236 --> 00:40:34,481
It's not about the affairs.

496
00:40:35,468 --> 00:40:37,417
But you completely changed after that.

497
00:40:37,992 --> 00:40:40,052
You've become a totally
different person.

498
00:40:48,903 --> 00:40:50,969
And I am still paying for that.

499
00:41:10,005 --> 00:41:11,758
So keeping all that
in mind we come back to...

500
00:41:11,838 --> 00:41:16,155
As I was earlier saying the
earliest composition in Sanskrit was

501
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:18,289
the Rigveda.

502
00:41:18,588 --> 00:41:20,020
Even in that time

503
00:41:21,003 --> 00:41:23,496
Sanskrit was a language the elite.

504
00:41:23,888 --> 00:41:26,773
So my point is that language itself

505
00:41:26,923 --> 00:41:29,385
is a limiting form of communication.

506
00:41:29,801 --> 00:41:32,018
However, there is something

507
00:41:33,204 --> 00:41:34,469
special

508
00:41:34,879 --> 00:41:36,013
that language does

509
00:41:36,093 --> 00:41:37,928
when it changes form.

510
00:41:38,432 --> 00:41:39,905
Can you tell me what that is?

511
00:41:40,074 --> 00:41:40,958
Poetry.

512
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:42,986
Poetry, thank you.

513
00:41:43,066 --> 00:41:44,233
Anjali.

514
00:41:44,313 --> 00:41:46,705
And next time we're going to discuss

515
00:41:47,221 --> 00:41:49,499
the greatest Sanskrit
poem ever written.

516
00:41:49,579 --> 00:41:53,389
It's called 'Avigyan Shakuntalam'
written by Kalidas.

517
00:41:53,998 --> 00:41:56,670
Anyway, thanks for coming
and I'll see you next time.

518
00:42:01,184 --> 00:42:02,056
Any questions?

519
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:05,509
What about romantic ballads?

520
00:42:05,971 --> 00:42:10,446
Were the being written
in Sanskrit or Pali?

521
00:42:12,113 --> 00:42:15,597
- So...are you going to tell me now or..
- what?

522
00:42:58,973 --> 00:42:59,748
Mr. Nair.

523
00:43:01,125 --> 00:43:01,804
What?

524
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,448
Would you like to come with me?

525
00:43:08,465 --> 00:43:09,184
Why?

526
00:43:11,485 --> 00:43:12,846
Whose payroll are you?

527
00:43:13,473 --> 00:43:14,699
What?

528
00:43:15,226 --> 00:43:16,822
What is your salary?

529
00:43:18,673 --> 00:43:20,027
2000 pounds.

530
00:43:21,438 --> 00:43:24,872
And how did you send 10,400
pounds through money laundering?

531
00:43:26,781 --> 00:43:28,370
I won it in poker.

532
00:43:30,187 --> 00:43:31,976
How much do you spend on girls?

533
00:43:35,277 --> 00:43:36,553
Don't you have any shame?

534
00:43:36,633 --> 00:43:38,007
You work at the Indian Embassy.

535
00:43:38,155 --> 00:43:40,514
I do my work with honestly.

536
00:43:41,335 --> 00:43:42,189
Believe me.

537
00:43:42,378 --> 00:43:44,093
Then why is your computer encrypted?

538
00:43:46,305 --> 00:43:48,851
It's a personal folder.

539
00:43:48,931 --> 00:43:50,281
You can check it if you want.

540
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:52,513
We'll do that.

541
00:43:56,690 --> 00:43:58,600
I started playing poker this year.

542
00:43:59,705 --> 00:44:01,336
When my parents came down with a viral

543
00:44:01,416 --> 00:44:04,163
they spent their life's
saving in hospital bills.

544
00:44:05,644 --> 00:44:07,684
I couldn't have supported
them with just my salary.

545
00:44:08,081 --> 00:44:09,242
So I started online gambling.

546
00:44:09,322 --> 00:44:10,966
And now you're addicted to it.

547
00:44:14,035 --> 00:44:15,955
If I don't send money
to my wife post our divorce

548
00:44:16,035 --> 00:44:17,853
she doesn't let me meet my daughter.

549
00:44:28,786 --> 00:44:30,604
And even that guy Nishant is clean.

550
00:44:30,684 --> 00:44:31,816
As soon as his papers were processed

551
00:44:31,896 --> 00:44:34,369
he moved to Amsterdam
with his real boyfriend.

552
00:44:37,512 --> 00:44:38,894
My hand's fractured.

553
00:44:39,128 --> 00:44:41,904
Send these pictures of Sharad
and his girlfriend to Yuki.

554
00:44:43,267 --> 00:44:46,486
I don't understand how they came after me?

555
00:44:47,758 --> 00:44:49,786
Slowly they are following all of us.

556
00:44:50,566 --> 00:44:51,515
That's fine.

557
00:44:52,624 --> 00:44:54,137
They shouldn't be ahead of us.

558
00:44:54,579 --> 00:44:55,929
Even I don't understand.

559
00:44:56,111 --> 00:44:59,071
There were only two people who
processed's Biren's papers in the Embassy.

560
00:44:59,151 --> 00:45:00,338
Jeevan and Azad.

561
00:45:00,418 --> 00:45:03,237
If both of them are innocent,
then who is the mole?

562
00:45:13,447 --> 00:45:14,430
Hi.

563
00:45:15,819 --> 00:45:17,786
How is the investigation coming along?

564
00:45:18,698 --> 00:45:20,094
It's all a dead end.

565
00:45:21,989 --> 00:45:22,858
What happened?

566
00:45:24,475 --> 00:45:26,306
Jeevan committed suicide today.

567
00:45:26,386 --> 00:45:27,318
What?

568
00:45:29,818 --> 00:45:32,718
His body was found near
the Wembly train tracks.

569
00:45:33,841 --> 00:45:36,132
I had called him for the investigation.

570
00:45:36,212 --> 00:45:37,774
I am coming from his home now.

571
00:45:39,051 --> 00:45:40,447
His wife and daughter?

572
00:45:41,889 --> 00:45:44,186
We're preparing to send
them back to India today.

573
00:45:50,046 --> 00:45:51,471
He was one of my best.

574
00:45:56,242 --> 00:45:58,296
Are you sure it was suicide?

575
00:45:58,791 --> 00:46:01,430
There was a note in his pocket.

576
00:46:02,221 --> 00:46:04,625
I read that note with
the Police's permission.

577
00:46:05,472 --> 00:46:06,834
What was written in it?

578
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:13,802
He's blamed you for harassment, Uma.

579
00:46:51,728 --> 00:46:53,496
I can see that you know
the art form already.

580
00:46:54,303 --> 00:46:56,041
It was many years ago.

581
00:46:57,671 --> 00:46:59,101
What province are you from?

582
00:47:01,233 --> 00:47:02,145
Xizang. (Tibet)

583
00:47:09,149 --> 00:47:10,407
Good morning, Anjali.

584
00:47:13,065 --> 00:47:14,237
What's tha plan?

585
00:47:14,955 --> 00:47:17,427
Uma, the girl Sharad
is having an affair with

586
00:47:17,903 --> 00:47:19,628
she came to Tai-Chi today.

587
00:47:20,034 --> 00:47:20,732
What?

588
00:47:20,875 --> 00:47:22,010
They are up to something.

589
00:47:25,125 --> 00:47:27,316
'Chang and Anjali together mean'

590
00:47:27,645 --> 00:47:29,302
'they want something from Sharad.'

591
00:47:29,609 --> 00:47:31,255
'Something doesn't fit.'

592
00:47:31,882 --> 00:47:34,333
A straightforward honeytrap.

593
00:47:34,512 --> 00:47:37,938
He's been travelling from one
country to another with Niru for 10 years.

594
00:47:38,018 --> 00:47:40,024
He knows what a honeytrap is.

595
00:47:40,394 --> 00:47:43,842
In a honey trap, a man doesn't
think from his brain but someplace else.

596
00:47:43,922 --> 00:47:47,347
And by the time he realises
this he's already missed the bus.

597
00:47:48,309 --> 00:47:50,720
Let's see how valid your theory is.

598
00:47:53,606 --> 00:47:55,111
Time to find out.

599
00:47:55,891 --> 00:47:57,929
Sharad just left home and going somewhere.

600
00:47:58,184 --> 00:47:59,451
I will inform Arjun.

601
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:03,699
Let's go get Sharad.

602
00:48:08,807 --> 00:48:11,109
Sharad didn't just
start cheating suddenly.

603
00:48:11,879 --> 00:48:14,324
All these relationships
are very complicated.

604
00:48:14,785 --> 00:48:16,159
Everyone's alone out here.

605
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:17,726
Shattered on the inside.

606
00:48:20,086 --> 00:48:22,052
You're beginning to
sympathise with the suspect.

607
00:48:22,821 --> 00:48:23,846
Here's a question.

608
00:48:23,926 --> 00:48:25,602
Why did you ever get married?

609
00:48:26,065 --> 00:48:27,975
This is not the time for such questions.

610
00:48:28,248 --> 00:48:29,262
Tell me.

611
00:48:34,998 --> 00:48:36,151
Cards were printed...

612
00:48:37,196 --> 00:48:38,518
And the bride ran out on you.

613
00:48:39,555 --> 00:48:40,396
No!

614
00:48:41,287 --> 00:48:42,106
I did.

615
00:48:43,075 --> 00:48:43,852
Why?

616
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:48,233
I never got that far.

617
00:48:49,373 --> 00:48:51,310
You couldn't make it to your own wedding?

618
00:48:51,510 --> 00:48:52,177
No.

619
00:48:53,616 --> 00:48:55,970
I couldn't get that
far in that relationship

620
00:48:56,050 --> 00:48:58,176
where I could take her responsibility.

621
00:49:00,444 --> 00:49:01,829
How far back is this?

622
00:49:01,909 --> 00:49:02,758
Myanmar.

623
00:49:03,527 --> 00:49:05,300
After the Met Syndicate assignment.

624
00:49:06,633 --> 00:49:10,372
After I returned I
realised that this wedding

625
00:49:11,367 --> 00:49:13,772
will ruin her life.

626
00:49:15,423 --> 00:49:17,275
You know, sometimes even I think

627
00:49:17,662 --> 00:49:21,179
whether I ruined Tanmay's
life by marrying him?

628
00:49:22,826 --> 00:49:24,929
Uma, you've ruined many lives.

629
00:49:27,178 --> 00:49:29,608
Did you get this cheap
sense of humour in Myanmar.

630
00:49:31,659 --> 00:49:34,088
This cheap sense of humour
is what makes Tanmay envy.

631
00:49:41,062 --> 00:49:42,618
You'll drop me home, nah!

632
00:49:42,698 --> 00:49:44,373
Yes, madam. And then to Sharad.

633
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:37,536
F**k! F**k!

634
00:51:07,216 --> 00:51:09,126
We could have saved him, Uma.

635
00:51:10,215 --> 00:51:11,693
I can't believe they went so far.

636
00:51:12,043 --> 00:51:13,543
Don't blame yourself, Arjun.

637
00:51:14,013 --> 00:51:15,509
We can't compromise our cover.

638
00:51:18,116 --> 00:51:19,256
I don't know, Uma.

639
00:51:20,589 --> 00:51:22,425
Are we doing the right thing or not.

640
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:36,070
I am really-really sorry, Niru.

641
00:51:38,447 --> 00:51:39,980
I don't know what's happening.

642
00:51:41,342 --> 00:51:42,590
We'll find them.

643
00:51:47,965 --> 00:51:50,057
Sharad won't come back.

644
00:51:56,851 --> 00:51:58,196
It's all my fault.

645
00:51:59,090 --> 00:52:00,207
No, Niru.

646
00:52:00,407 --> 00:52:01,712
Please don't blame yourself.

647
00:52:04,134 --> 00:52:06,899
If you have any information
then please tell me.

648
00:52:09,276 --> 00:52:11,453
I knew he was having an affair.

649
00:52:14,537 --> 00:52:16,372
I should have tried harder.

650
00:52:20,717 --> 00:52:21,966
But why

651
00:52:22,901 --> 00:52:24,508
did she kill Sharad.

652
00:52:26,001 --> 00:52:28,019
That woman is working for the MSS.

653
00:52:32,252 --> 00:52:33,693
Did you know about his affair...

654
00:52:36,623 --> 00:52:37,850
We were tracking him.

655
00:52:39,984 --> 00:52:41,238
I've a question.

656
00:52:42,231 --> 00:52:44,684
Did Sharad know any of your passwords?

657
00:52:47,725 --> 00:52:49,652
He was never interested in my work.

658
00:52:53,129 --> 00:52:54,308
He was innocent.

659
00:52:57,328 --> 00:52:59,038
He was innocent.

660
00:53:19,365 --> 00:53:20,380
Can we talk?

661
00:53:20,608 --> 00:53:21,633
One minute.

662
00:53:24,107 --> 00:53:26,093
You can do this later.

663
00:53:26,173 --> 00:53:28,016
I am trying to work.

664
00:53:47,537 --> 00:53:50,685
Yuki's intel confirmed
that Chang is behind Angelie.

665
00:53:51,054 --> 00:53:53,026
But why kill Sharad?

666
00:53:54,468 --> 00:53:59,241
As the date of the conference is
drawing closer they are growing nervous.

667
00:54:00,089 --> 00:54:01,841
That's why Sharad died.

668
00:54:02,183 --> 00:54:04,748
But why Sharad? He knew nothing.

669
00:54:06,212 --> 00:54:07,193
Or did he?

670
00:54:07,717 --> 00:54:12,386
Maybe they told Sharad to get
some confidential information from Nirupa.

671
00:54:12,821 --> 00:54:14,253
And Sharad resisted.

672
00:54:15,748 --> 00:54:18,619
And maybe Yuki is a double agent.

673
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:22,730
She's misleading us
on Chang's instructions.

674
00:54:23,078 --> 00:54:24,660
No. That's not possible.

675
00:54:34,442 --> 00:54:37,783
Think, Uma.
How did she trace Chang so easily?

676
00:54:38,367 --> 00:54:41,317
I know Yuki and her
entire family very well.

677
00:54:41,647 --> 00:54:43,254
There's no way she is a double agent.

678
00:54:43,334 --> 00:54:45,238
That's the problem with you, Uma.

679
00:54:45,318 --> 00:54:46,850
Your trust is blinding you.

680
00:54:47,095 --> 00:54:48,822
Don't you trust me, Arjun?

681
00:54:49,210 --> 00:54:51,906
Or is it your strategy
to always undermine me?

682
00:55:04,237 --> 00:55:05,849
You didn't learn anything?

683
00:55:10,190 --> 00:55:13,883
I thought you were special...

684
00:55:15,998 --> 00:55:19,636
But you really disappointed me.

685
00:55:23,658 --> 00:55:26,932
Tai Chi teaches you
to move with the world.

686
00:55:30,106 --> 00:55:32,395
I'll give you a minute to decide

687
00:55:34,074 --> 00:55:36,895
which side of the world you are on

688
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:54,766
F**k!

689
00:55:55,849 --> 00:55:56,824
What happened?

690
00:55:56,904 --> 00:55:58,083
That's Yuki.

691
00:55:58,345 --> 00:55:59,177
What?

692
00:55:59,257 --> 00:56:00,881
These people are very desperate right now.

693
00:56:00,961 --> 00:56:02,101
They can do anything.

694
00:56:02,323 --> 00:56:03,765
They will make her spill everything.

695
00:56:12,556 --> 00:56:14,170
No. She doesn't know anything.

696
00:56:14,530 --> 00:56:15,993
What are you saying, Uma?

697
00:56:16,348 --> 00:56:18,058
She works for us.

698
00:56:18,138 --> 00:56:19,586
You've met so many times with her.

699
00:56:19,666 --> 00:56:21,984
- About Biren...
- She doesn't know anything about Biren.

700
00:56:27,968 --> 00:56:29,340
I am coming. I am coming.

701
00:57:09,823 --> 00:57:12,120
How many more people have to die, Uma?

702
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:14,879
This is a bloody unmitigated disaster!

703
00:57:15,118 --> 00:57:18,521
All the channels are talking
about Sharad and Nirupama!

704
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:20,327
What's going on under your watch?

705
00:57:20,664 --> 00:57:24,590
- Sir...
- You couldn't find the mole or the source!

706
00:57:25,458 --> 00:57:29,063
I should've transferred you back
to Delhi after the Istanbul disaster!

707
00:57:29,474 --> 00:57:30,295
But no!

708
00:57:30,375 --> 00:57:33,390
I gave you a second chance,
and this is what I get.

709
00:57:33,470 --> 00:57:34,182
Hello, sir.

710
00:57:35,202 --> 00:57:37,322
No need to dip up old graves.

711
00:57:37,801 --> 00:57:39,980
Istanbul is 3056 kilometres away.

712
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:41,184
Let it stay that way.

713
00:57:43,629 --> 00:57:44,843
Pack your things, Uma.

714
00:57:45,704 --> 00:57:47,123
You're coming back home.

715
00:57:47,321 --> 00:57:49,010
Arjun will take charge of the unit.

716
00:57:55,081 --> 00:57:57,013
I'll prepare for the handover.

717
00:58:08,981 --> 00:58:10,656
Since when did you start
listening to your seniors?

718
00:58:11,544 --> 00:58:13,888
Finally, this is your store now.

719
00:58:14,257 --> 00:58:16,192
So whether you turn it into
a massage parlour or strip club

720
00:58:16,272 --> 00:58:17,098
none of my business.

721
00:58:20,457 --> 00:58:21,956
Let's get back to work.

722
00:58:22,303 --> 00:58:26,390
One thing,
when Dave and Chang tracked you down

723
00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:29,235
did you call or text anyone?

724
00:58:30,004 --> 00:58:30,819
Just Uma.

725
00:58:30,899 --> 00:58:32,672
All the other communication
was over the Comms.

726
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:38,593
How did Dave and Chang find out?

727
00:58:39,391 --> 00:58:42,691
And they found Yuki after I texted her.

728
00:58:46,903 --> 00:58:49,394
Biren wanted to send this painting to me.

729
00:58:49,662 --> 00:58:51,303
He was sending me a message.

730
00:58:53,031 --> 00:58:56,326
There must be some information
about the source in it.

731
00:58:56,933 --> 00:59:00,417
What could be better cover
for an art collector than this?

732
00:59:01,143 --> 00:59:03,395
This is what you wanted to ask Yuki,
didn't you?

733
00:59:04,884 --> 00:59:07,698
No one knew that I sent a text to Yuki.

734
00:59:08,428 --> 00:59:09,705
M, check my phone.

735
00:59:23,329 --> 00:59:24,452
Your phone is bugged.

736
00:59:24,532 --> 00:59:25,324
What?

737
00:59:29,731 --> 00:59:31,304
How did I not see this coming?

738
00:59:32,239 --> 00:59:34,259
This bug has mirrored your phone.

739
00:59:34,427 --> 00:59:39,106
It will send information about any
calls and texts you make to its source.

740
00:59:39,186 --> 00:59:40,438
Don't remove this bug.

741
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:42,616
They shouldn't know that we know.

742
00:59:42,850 --> 00:59:44,839
We'll only communicate over comms now.

743
00:59:45,158 --> 00:59:47,175
And we'll have to leave
this office as well.

744
00:59:48,537 --> 00:59:49,328
Okay.

745
00:59:49,557 --> 00:59:50,703
Let's get going.

746
00:59:59,201 --> 01:00:00,700
Day of the Conference.

747
01:00:02,530 --> 01:00:04,525
Delegates from all over
the country have arrived.

748
01:00:04,906 --> 01:00:08,617
We don't know about
the source or the mole.

749
01:00:10,602 --> 01:00:14,717
All we know is that the MSS and their
mole don't know this information either.

750
01:00:19,358 --> 01:00:21,217
We have only one chance.

751
01:00:21,565 --> 01:00:25,021
We must get to the source first
and take him to the Indian Embassy.

752
01:00:26,175 --> 01:00:29,324
Uma, the source is someone
from the Chinese Delegation.

753
01:00:29,404 --> 01:00:31,426
But do we even have a mole?

754
01:00:32,025 --> 01:00:32,903
What?

755
01:00:34,009 --> 01:00:36,733
Maybe they got the
information from your phone?

756
01:00:37,298 --> 01:00:40,177
I never talked or texted
Biren from my phone.

757
01:00:42,314 --> 01:00:43,681
When did they put this bug?

758
01:00:44,548 --> 01:00:45,545
I don't know.

759
01:00:46,343 --> 01:00:48,987
But we must find the source now.

760
01:00:50,486 --> 01:00:52,338
Who could it be among these eight people?

761
01:00:56,002 --> 01:00:58,601
What's this going on between you two.

762
01:01:03,229 --> 01:01:06,102
"Where the river and the sun meet."

763
01:01:06,654 --> 01:01:08,091
"Meet me there."

764
01:01:11,952 --> 01:01:14,548
"Where the river and the sun meet."

765
01:01:14,628 --> 01:01:16,423
"Meet me there."

766
01:01:18,184 --> 01:01:19,831
There's nothing here.

767
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:24,185
"Where time began."

768
01:01:25,536 --> 01:01:27,337
"Where time began."

769
01:01:29,144 --> 01:01:31,181
"Time began."

770
01:01:34,418 --> 01:01:36,867
Beginning of Kaal (Time).

771
01:01:39,701 --> 01:01:41,791
Where Kaal began.

772
01:01:43,928 --> 01:01:45,700
Where Kaal began.

773
01:01:46,457 --> 01:01:50,046
Meet me where 'Kaal' began.

774
01:01:58,467 --> 01:02:00,880
Listen, this is our last chance.

775
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:03,332
The source was going
to meet Biren in a gallery.

776
01:02:03,412 --> 01:02:04,368
Kaal Gallery.

777
01:02:04,939 --> 01:02:06,655
- Are you sure?
- Completely!

778
01:02:07,191 --> 01:02:08,747
I checked the itinerary and saw that

779
01:02:08,827 --> 01:02:12,172
the Chinese delegation is being
taken to Kaal Gallery for recreation.

780
01:02:13,948 --> 01:02:15,948
The exhibition is called "Elements".

781
01:02:16,743 --> 01:02:20,957
You just have to figure out
how the river and sun will meet.

782
01:02:25,591 --> 01:02:27,577
You check that way,
and I'll check this way.

783
01:02:28,407 --> 01:02:29,660
Remember your training.

784
01:02:30,137 --> 01:02:32,199
"Observe, and it shall reveal itself."

785
01:03:38,604 --> 01:03:40,314
"Where the river and the sun meet."

786
01:03:40,441 --> 01:03:41,836
"Meet me there."

787
01:03:51,263 --> 01:03:53,186
Biren has sent me to get you.

788
01:03:53,415 --> 01:03:54,632
Where is Biren?

789
01:03:55,843 --> 01:03:56,985
They killed him.

790
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:00,950
Beautiful isn't it?

791
01:04:02,252 --> 01:04:03,775
Yes it is.

792
01:04:05,877 --> 01:04:08,064
Beautiful, isn't it?

793
01:04:08,652 --> 01:04:09,569
Indeed.

794
01:04:11,214 --> 01:04:13,788
I meant being a mother.

795
01:04:26,658 --> 01:04:29,305
I hope he's not in the mood for fireworks.

796
01:04:30,854 --> 01:04:31,856
They are not stupid.

797
01:04:31,936 --> 01:04:33,456
They wouldn't want a public exhibition.

798
01:04:38,705 --> 01:04:39,868
I have an idea.

799
01:04:43,634 --> 01:04:44,585
What happened?

800
01:04:45,835 --> 01:04:47,390
Chang isn't following us.

801
01:04:52,409 --> 01:04:54,551
I've having deja-vu.

802
01:04:55,698 --> 01:04:57,292
Something bad is going to happen.

803
01:04:58,034 --> 01:04:58,997
Instinct.

804
01:05:04,979 --> 01:05:06,396
Wait here, I'll be right back.

805
01:07:03,382 --> 01:07:05,622
Sang, you're safe with us.

806
01:07:05,907 --> 01:07:07,335
There's just one more step.

807
01:07:07,914 --> 01:07:09,739
Please be safe, okay.

808
01:07:10,013 --> 01:07:11,126
Thank you.

809
01:07:12,388 --> 01:07:13,656
Come on, let's hurry up.

810
01:07:15,343 --> 01:07:16,284
One second.

811
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:17,899
Yeah, Niru.

812
01:07:19,020 --> 01:07:20,279
Are you alright?

813
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:30,316
Yes, I am fine.

814
01:07:31,098 --> 01:07:32,426
How does she know?

815
01:07:33,630 --> 01:07:34,823
Thank God.

816
01:07:35,061 --> 01:07:36,169
Come down to the Embassy.

817
01:07:37,686 --> 01:07:38,869
No, not the Embassy.

818
01:07:38,949 --> 01:07:40,101
You'll be safe here.

819
01:07:40,239 --> 01:07:41,242
No.

820
01:07:41,817 --> 01:07:43,560
They must be keeping
an eye on the Embassy.

821
01:07:44,314 --> 01:07:46,154
I'll text you in a while.

822
01:07:54,449 --> 01:07:56,638
That's why Chang didn't stop us.

823
01:07:57,906 --> 01:08:00,215
M, get the bug out of my phone.

824
01:08:00,902 --> 01:08:02,551
'And track Chang's car.'

825
01:08:02,831 --> 01:08:06,489
'The number is YK16 HSN.'

826
01:08:09,482 --> 01:08:12,543
We found the source,
but the story doesn't end here.

827
01:08:13,123 --> 01:08:16,539
The mole knows about the source now,
and so do the MSS.

828
01:08:17,032 --> 01:08:19,791
And they will try
anything to get to Shang.

829
01:08:46,885 --> 01:08:47,944
Great job.

830
01:08:48,159 --> 01:08:51,016
I've already spoken about it.
Shang will get asylum.

831
01:08:51,826 --> 01:08:54,753
Shang risked her life and trusted us.

832
01:08:55,396 --> 01:08:56,662
We can't let her down.

833
01:08:56,849 --> 01:08:59,368
The Foreign Minister personally
took permission from the PM.

834
01:09:01,067 --> 01:09:02,047
Where is she?

835
01:09:03,270 --> 01:09:04,072
Downstairs.

836
01:09:04,294 --> 01:09:05,240
Call her up.

837
01:09:07,587 --> 01:09:10,316
We'll go to the embassy,
and I'll fast track her asylum.

838
01:09:29,918 --> 01:09:31,293
You've done a great job.

839
01:09:31,838 --> 01:09:33,637
We're so thankful to you.

840
01:09:43,404 --> 01:09:44,390
Shall we?

841
01:10:01,045 --> 01:10:02,559
Let me make a call first.

842
01:10:05,481 --> 01:10:07,369
Your sniper is dead, Niru.

843
01:10:08,016 --> 01:10:09,029
Chang is dead.

844
01:10:15,777 --> 01:10:17,102
'No'

845
01:10:17,483 --> 01:10:19,956
'They must be keeping
an eye on the Embassy.'

846
01:10:20,036 --> 01:10:21,781
'I'll text you in a while.'

847
01:10:22,227 --> 01:10:23,915
'Remove the bug from my phone.'

848
01:10:24,302 --> 01:10:25,908
'And track Chang's car.'

849
01:10:25,988 --> 01:10:28,531
'The number is YK16 HSN.'

850
01:10:30,778 --> 01:10:32,610
'This is our last chance, Arjun.'

851
01:10:33,208 --> 01:10:34,681
'I am there. Trust me.'

852
01:10:34,958 --> 01:10:36,613
'I always trust you.'

853
01:11:18,198 --> 01:11:21,154
Uma, he's done. I am in position.

854
01:11:21,763 --> 01:11:23,330
No one can harm Shang now.

855
01:11:28,699 --> 01:11:30,880
You bugged my phone.

856
01:11:33,178 --> 01:11:34,553
Try it.

857
01:11:35,107 --> 01:11:36,845
And you must follow her.

858
01:11:36,925 --> 01:11:38,454
'Hello, boss, where are you?'

859
01:11:38,609 --> 01:11:42,121
'I don't understand
how they came after me.'

860
01:11:42,925 --> 01:11:45,891
'No one knew I sent a message to Yuki.'

861
01:11:50,388 --> 01:11:53,776
When you couldn't find
anything you're blaming me.

862
01:11:57,806 --> 01:11:59,621
'You should investigate this.'

863
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:01,924
'If you need any support then tell me.'

864
01:12:04,366 --> 01:12:05,800
'Any lead on Biren Ghosh?'

865
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:07,189
'Let me know if you find out anything.'

866
01:12:08,516 --> 01:12:09,557
'It's all my fault.'

867
01:12:11,626 --> 01:12:13,326
I am not accusing you.

868
01:12:14,327 --> 01:12:14,965
I know...

869
01:12:15,045 --> 01:12:16,441
you were honey-trapped in Beijing.

870
01:12:19,009 --> 01:12:22,563
And to save your career,
you sold out your country.

871
01:12:24,825 --> 01:12:27,682
And to mislead us and protect you

872
01:12:29,076 --> 01:12:30,529
Chang killed Sharad.

873
01:12:40,027 --> 01:12:41,812
I love my job more than anything.

874
01:12:43,681 --> 01:12:45,574
I did everything to protect it.

875
01:12:46,476 --> 01:12:49,886
But some mistakes cannot be undone.

876
01:12:54,678 --> 01:12:56,159
I loved Sharad.

877
01:13:32,132 --> 01:13:35,667
Not every war is fought on the
battlefield or with Foreign policies.

878
01:13:36,505 --> 01:13:39,653
Some unheard battles end
in the deserted lanes of the city.

879
01:13:41,190 --> 01:13:45,645
This is just another story
in the long list of unsung heroes.

880
01:13:46,842 --> 01:13:51,962
The list that Shang gave us
prevented another pandemic, and war.

881
01:13:52,876 --> 01:13:54,765
But how long will this peace last?
