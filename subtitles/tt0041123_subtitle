3
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,170
I rode the horse for two days,
at your insistence.

4
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:55,430
- My whole body aches.
- Just once more today too.

5
00:02:55,990 --> 00:03:02,420
Are you mad? I intend to sleep
till 10 o'clock today.

6
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,920
I don't enjoy it alone.

7
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,550
This too will be sorted out soon.

8
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:18,210
- I'm leaving.
- There you go!

9
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,630
What did you say?
Neena fell of the horse?

10
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,540
Where are you calling from?
I'll be there right away.

11
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:44,100
Hey! I'm a doctor!
I'm not a horse!

12
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,150
Where's my horse?

13
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:53,270
- Here I am!
- You? A horse?

14
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,510
Whether you call me
a horse or a laborer...

15
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:59,390
I was the one who
brought you here.

16
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,320
So, you're waiting here
to collect your wages?

17
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:10,710
If there's a price for
saving a life, give it to me.

18
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:15,550
Hold on! Let me see if you have
delivered my limbs safely or not.

19
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:19,430
Your arms, legs, nose, elbows,
knees are all in order.

20
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,420
If you don't believe me,
ask the doctor.

21
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,040
Your good deeds have come
in handy today.

22
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,830
This is why I've always discouraged
you from riding a horse.

23
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:35,250
- How are you, dear?
- I'm fine, Daddy.

24
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:37,600
Let's go home now.

25
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,950
Thanks a lot, doctor.

26
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:42,350
- You're taking her at your own risk.
- Don't worry.

27
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:44,550
- Why don't you wear it?
- No, I'm fine.

28
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,500
Mr. Horse...

29
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,490
thank you very much.

30
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:03,480
- Horse?
- That's the title she gave me.

31
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,580
- My name is Dilip.
- He saved my life, Daddy.

32
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,770
Thanks a lot, Mr. Dilip.

33
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:13,560
- Do make sure you visit us.
- Sure, I will. After all...

34
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:16,840
- I've to collect my dues.
- I'll remember.

35
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:18,970
- Bye.
- Bye.

36
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:56,630
Why did you take the trouble
of bringing this?

37
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,550
Don't you like it?

38
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:17,010
You haven't told me
where you're from.

39
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:20,400
Any place but Shikarpur.

40
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:25,460
Tell me.

41
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:27,880
Actually, I'm from Africa.

42
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,470
Believe me, I'm really from Africa.

43
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,090
My father has a business there.

44
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:46,650
You might now want to know why
I don't resemble a gorilla.

45
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:11,010
I have lost my heart somewhere today

46
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,490
You might say I have given it to someone

47
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:50,340
Every moment someone
started coming near me

48
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:58,910
Began telling me the secrets
of this sudden excitement

49
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:07,460
Our eyes clashed with each other

50
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:15,750
It was like a poem for hearts

51
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:55,320
Someone is in my eyes but...

52
00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:01,620
who is it? No one knows

53
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:19,850
Is this the home of that someone?

54
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:29,790
With mischievious eyes
and a different style

55
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,080
I sank the ship of my heart

56
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:42,230
You might say I belong to someone now

57
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:54,970
You sing so well. I wish I could
go on listening to you.

58
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,110
Thank you. But don't look
upon me as a singer.

59
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,200
So when will we meet again?

60
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:06,130
Of the 365 days in a year,
we spend at least half here.

61
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,470
We will meet some time.

62
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:12,690
Some time? There's the element
of waiting in this 'some time'.

63
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,180
The person who waits knows
how enjoyable it is to wait.

64
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:27,570
You too wait?

65
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:39,290
- I hope you aren't hurt.
- What's the point in asking now?

66
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:41,850
Whatever had to happen has happened.

67
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,650
The two of you have met
in an interesting way.

68
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:48,750
She's Sheela, my girlfriend. And
he's Mr. Dilip. He saved my life.

69
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:55,310
It's good that he saved your life.
But why did he try to kill me?

70
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:58,800
- It's so agonizing!
- Stop your pretension.

71
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:00,710
Otherwise I'll injure
your other leg too.

72
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:38,670
- He plays so well!
- He's amazing!

73
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:45,550
He's so good at playing games,
in horse-riding and singing.

74
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:49,200
- He's very handsome too!
- You know better!

75
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,520
What've you been talking about?

76
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,080
- We're preparing to target you.
- To target me?

77
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,410
You're most welcome.

78
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,550
I didn't hear you
playing the piano.

79
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:07,330
- You're being stylish now!
- Now you are...

80
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,280
- Would she not be going home?
- It appears to be so.

81
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:14,260
- Wouldn't you be going home?
- Not till I listen to the piano.

82
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,370
- Can you sing?
- Yes.

83
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,350
- Will you sing?
- All right.

84
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,410
Then I will play the piano too.

85
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,910
- I am leaving.
- Stop! You've to sing first.

86
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,870
- Come on.
- Come on.

87
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:50,230
Don't be afraid to love someone

88
00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:02,110
Fill your life with love.
This life is too short

89
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,840
You decide to either
live your life or just exist

90
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:23,810
Nothing remains constant in life,
seize the moments of love

91
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:31,120
Life is summed up in two words,
'love' and 'youth'

92
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,260
Always keep this in mind

93
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:17,070
The world is a bed of thorns
where love is like a beautiful garden

94
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:27,440
Listen to the voice of your heart.
Don't worry about the consequences

95
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:37,000
Just go through this phase as well

96
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:19,010
If you don't listen to me
you may regret it.

97
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:32,010
Make your choices now, it's your love,
and opposing you is the world

98
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,930
Laugh and sigh in love

99
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,780
Don't be afraid to love someone

100
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:57,480
- Master is calling you.
- All right.

101
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,210
Don't let him go.
I'll be right back.

102
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:05,050
Instead, you could clip my wings
and put me inside a cage.

103
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,016
What is it, Daddy?

104
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,520
Here's the list of guests to be
invited to your birthday party.

105
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:32,710
It's surprising that Dilip's
name isn't on the list.

106
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:34,870
I was sure you'd mention it.

107
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:36,900
Invite him if you wish.

108
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:41,250
But you don't seem to be
happy about inviting him.

109
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:43,950
I didn't think it's appropriate.

110
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:50,640
After all, he saved my life.

111
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:54,950
Give him as much money as you like
in return. Or offer him a job.

112
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:59,980
In your opinion, can these things
compensate for my life?

113
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:04,200
I don't think so.

114
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:09,020
Moreover, he wants neither a job
nor your money.

115
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:16,460
There are some things which can't
be learned from books...

116
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:20,520
nor do college professors
teach about it.

117
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:26,710
One learns it by experience.

118
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,740
And it will be some time
before you get some experience.

119
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,140
You're talking in such
an old-fashioned manner.

120
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,090
If you continue to think
along such lines...

121
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,110
society won't allow you to survive.

122
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,360
You'll fall from the horse
every now and then...

123
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:47,500
and every time a new person
will be obliging you.

124
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:50,190
Know what the outcome will be?

125
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:53,130
This home will become
a full-fledged zoo...

126
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,750
where everybody will
speak in their language...

127
00:21:57,290 --> 00:22:00,000
and you won't be able
to understand any of them.

128
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:17,840
When I'm no more,
you will remember my words.

129
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,390
I wonder why I don't like
so much freedom.

130
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:31,170
Possibly because
I'm old-fashioned.

131
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:34,340
Like you just said.

132
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,730
Invite him.

133
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:11,286
She's Shantadevi. She was
like a sister to your mother.

134
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:12,840
- Greetings.
- Bless you.

135
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:16,810
But she's not to be seen ever
since your mother passed away.

136
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:21,850
Greetings, Aunty.

137
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,650
Bless you.
Come, sit by my side.

138
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,500
You're coming now!

139
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:40,420
- Are you lost or something?
- Let me regain my senses!

140
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:45,470
What an exciting dress!

141
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:49,250
You should also praise
the one who's wearing it.

142
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:52,350
You understand things a bit late.
I meant just that!

143
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,400
You talk in roundabout ways.

144
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,941
I think your sense of understanding
things is round-about.

145
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:59,350
- May I say something?
- Go ahead.

146
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:05,960
Something is amiss in your dress.
If you permit, may I fill the void?

147
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,500
You're most welcome.

148
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:24,420
You're putting the flower on her.
But my heart is filled with fragrance.

149
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,860
Watch out! Or you may faint!

150
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,810
On this joyous occasion, you will
have to take some trouble.

151
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:33,140
Most gladly.

152
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:38,720
Sheela is ready to dance,
and the guests want to hear you sing.

153
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:43,980
Who can refuse you today?
But there's one condition.

154
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,820
- Yes?
- You'll remain by my side.

155
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:51,380
I promise to sing a song people
will remember all their lives.

156
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,880
You don't even respond to me now!

157
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:04,000
As if you care for me.

158
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:08,560
I'll surely ask you today
what exactly is on your mind?

159
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,440
It's better you don't ask.

160
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:16,040
Then should I assume that
my daddy is angry at me?

161
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:17,830
Come here, will you?

162
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:34,600
- Come, let's have breakfast.
- No, I don't feel like it.

163
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:38,400
- Are you upset?
- Why do you hide things from me?

164
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:41,600
- Want my frank opinion?
- Yes.

165
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:45,650
I don't like your meeting Dilip
so uninhibitedly.

166
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:48,640
Everybody felt the same way
at the party yesterday.

167
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:52,700
And I know how embarrassed I was.

168
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,780
Why worry about what others think?

169
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:01,290
Who can understand me
better than you?

170
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:07,100
Moreover, you always said
you didn't care what others said.

171
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:11,250
When it comes to oneself,
I can feel how vulnerable I am.

172
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:20,500
Does it mean you
no longer trust your Neena?

173
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:27,000
After my hard work of 19 years,
don't misunderstand me now.

174
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:33,000
I know that you're naive.
You can never have a bad feeling.

175
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:37,540
But meeting a stranger like this...

176
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:42,630
can surely give a wrong impression,
both to him and to society at large.

177
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:52,430
Let me tell you something today.

178
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:57,300
It's possible that I may be
too young to say this.

179
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:07,910
Your daughter'll never do anything
to cause you embarrassment.

180
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,030
Let's have breakfast now.

181
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:36,750
There's surely going to be some
commotion at Sheela's birthday today.

182
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,410
- Commotion?
- Yes.

183
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,930
Everybody is staring at you.

184
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:45,520
They don't realize, if there's
lightning they'll all be blinded.

185
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:49,980
They know it too well.
Lightning has already struck.

186
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:53,090
But don't you be under
any false impression.

187
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,220
If you leave, there
will be silence here.

188
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:01,590
Do I play drums here?

189
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,416
Your senseless talk,
your unmelodious songs...

190
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,920
from whom would I hear them then?

191
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,980
If that's so, then I won't go.

192
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,080
- But there's a condition.
- What's the condition?

193
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:16,960
What is that condition?

194
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:21,760
- Shall I speak up?
- Go ahead.

195
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:32,890
- Shall I speak?
- Go ahead.

196
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:38,820
How can I speak in her presence?

197
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:41,300
He's going to Africa.

198
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:44,360
Really? Somebody might fall dead.

199
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,100
Before dying, why don't
you dance with him once?

200
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:49,650
Come on.

201
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,940
One repents before dying.
One doesn't dance.

202
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:59,780
- Your daddy hasn't come yet?
- I wonder what's wrong.

203
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:02,090
He told me to go ahead
and he'd follow.

204
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,820
You mentioned dancing
with Sheela, didn't you?

205
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:08,880
- How about a dance, Uncle?
- Of course.

206
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,550
- A telephone for you.
- All right.

207
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:23,920
Excuse me, Uncle.
I'll be right back.

208
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:28,020
- What were you hiding from me?
- You'll be envious if you hear.

209
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:29,720
Why would I feel envious?

210
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,370
It had something to do
with the heart.

211
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:33,980
- With Neena?
- Yes.

212
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:36,930
There's no place for you
in her heart.

213
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:39,300
Didn't I say you'd feel envious?

214
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:41,390
If you don't believe me,
ask her yourself.

215
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:42,940
Is that so?

216
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:53,500
Sheela is a liar!
Know what she says?

217
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:59,180
Daddy has had a heart attack.
I'm going home.

218
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:00,440
I'll escort you home.

219
00:34:13,409 --> 00:34:14,759
What's happened to my dad?

220
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:21,499
Why don't you speak?

221
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:27,610
Why're you all around my dad?
Go away!

222
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:04,930
Drink this, Neena.

223
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:14,360
Drink it on your own, Neena.

224
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:33,750
Doctor, my name's Dilip.

225
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:42,680
It has been two days now.
She's neither eaten nor slept.

226
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:51,310
I cannot bear seeing her stiff
and with dry eyes, doctor.

227
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:55,930
I know her silence
is very dangerous.

228
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:59,340
It's better if she weeps uncontrollably.

229
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:02,410
But I don't know when and
how she will weep.

230
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:59,560
He's your Daddy, Neena.
One whom you love very much.

231
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:06,230
Without whom you cannot
live even for a moment.

232
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:17,930
He has gone far away from you.

233
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,760
You'll never be able
to see him again.

234
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,420
Never again.

235
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,000
Weep, Neena!

236
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:35,320
Weep! You've lost his protection!

237
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:39,250
Weep, Neena!

238
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:42,980
- Weep, Neena!
- No!

239
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:30,590
I have summoned you all
for something very important.

240
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:38,740
You know that father made crucial
decisions sitting in this chair.

241
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:43,630
He used to run such a huge
business empire with your support.

242
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:48,530
He has left us suddenly.

243
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:54,310
Now our sorrowful hearts are left
with only memories of him.

244
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:59,670
To immortalize him...

245
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:03,080
I want to build a large hospital
named after him...

246
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:09,110
which would offer free treatment
and accommodations for the ailing.

247
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:16,470
On behalf of the entire staff,
I assure you once again...

248
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:21,840
that it will be our foremost duty
to execute all your orders.

249
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,000
My father has left assets and
properties worth millions.

250
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:30,540
On the other hand, another person has
given me a new lease of life.

251
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:36,480
That person is Mr. Dilip,
my best friend.

252
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:43,280
I request him to sit in this chair,
and handle the business...

253
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:50,570
and consider himself to be an
equal partner along with me.

254
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:57,510
I hope you will all
abide by my decision...

255
00:39:58,050 --> 00:40:00,440
and help him in
running the business.

256
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:06,590
I offer you my congratulations
on behalf of all of us.

257
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:09,340
Why did you do this?

258
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:12,300
I'm prepared to fulfill
all your desires.

259
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:15,820
But I don't want your wealth.

260
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:20,900
Perhaps you forgot that
you once said...

261
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:24,250
that if there is any, you would
accept compensation for saving life.

262
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:27,200
And I had said that
I wouldn't forget.

263
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:30,610
- I was only joking with you.
- It's possible.

264
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:36,880
But what I've done is not a joke.
I've done it with a lot of thought.

265
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:41,010
Aren't you happy about
my being happy about it?

266
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:07,420
This is a blueprint of the proposed
hospital. You're sure to like it.

267
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:11,170
The lower portion will be for poor
people, laborers and beggars.

268
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:15,500
The upper floors are designed on the
lines of America's biggest hospital.

269
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:18,380
These special rooms will be meant
for affluent people.

270
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:19,530
Why?

271
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:24,130
Do affluent people suffer
from special diseases?

272
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:28,510
This hospital is not being made
so that affluent people...

273
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:30,590
could consider it as a
resthouse and relax for free.

274
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:32,606
The hospital is being built to
alleviate the sufferings...

275
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:34,390
and diseases of the
poor people and laborers.

276
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:44,080
Yes, yes. I will come right away.

277
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:58,650
Someone has brought happiness to my heart

278
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:04,180
My heart was dark.
He brought in the light of love

279
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:25,360
My heart is full of anticipation
and the desires have awakened now

280
00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:38,130
He gave my love a new life

281
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:50,180
The one who had brought
pain to my heart...

282
00:44:00,330 --> 00:44:05,100
now has brought laughter to my lips

283
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:13,560
Someone has brought happiness to my heart

284
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:19,060
My heart was dark.
He brought in the light of love

285
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:27,430
You seem to be well-equipped
to overpower someone.

286
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:30,860
You took very long.
I had been waiting for you.

287
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:35,360
Am I dreaming?

288
00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:44,920
I've seen you smile again
after a long time today.

289
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:50,490
You should ask why I am
feeling so happy today.

290
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:53,300
I don't have to ask you.

291
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:58,410
I can see my good fortune smiling
through your smile.

292
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:03,950
Rather, say that my fortune has
smiled today after a long time.

293
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:07,950
In that case, there will be a
shower of flowers from the sky...

294
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:11,106
and both of us will sing
songs of happiness...

295
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:12,930
and we will fly in the
skies to meet the moon.

296
00:45:13,690 --> 00:45:17,830
The moon will come down on the
earth to meet us. Let's go.

297
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:51,070
Look at your face! Are you back
from London or from some jail?

298
00:45:51,170 --> 00:45:54,460
The thing is, without you,
the whole world is a jail for me.

299
00:45:59,150 --> 00:46:02,430
I'm very glad to meet you, Mr. Dilip.
I've heard everything about you.

300
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:04,756
In fact, there were so many
praises about you that...

301
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:07,050
I got scared and rushed back.

302
00:46:08,050 --> 00:46:10,060
You got so scared that you
forgot to shave?

303
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:13,310
You've become very intelligent.
I'm leaving now. Meet you at home.

304
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,440
You're acting tough
the moment you've arrived!

305
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,740
- Do you want to fight with me?
- I don't dare do that!

306
00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:20,890
Then come along straightaway.
Otherwise I'll smash your nose.

307
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:23,080
- You've become quite a fighter!
- Yes.

308
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:25,970
- I've a revolver all the time.
- I see!

309
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:32,790
The thing is, I have
to meet mother first.

310
00:46:33,010 --> 00:46:35,680
- We will also accompany you.
- That's agreeable.

311
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:41,840
Mother!

312
00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:47,430
- Oh Mother!
- My son!

313
00:46:48,350 --> 00:46:49,620
My son!

314
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:21,870
Are you mad?
He'll always be alive for us.

315
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:26,610
It's just that he's
out of our sight.

316
00:47:28,970 --> 00:47:30,330
Wipe off your tears.

317
00:47:34,610 --> 00:47:37,500
You wrote to me once that
Mr. Dilip plays piano very well.

318
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:40,570
He makes laughing people to weep,
and weeping people to smile.

319
00:47:41,290 --> 00:47:43,290
Let me see your talent too!

320
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:47,900
I'm not in the mood today.

321
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:52,740
You're speaking like typical singers.
No mood, or that the voice is sore.

322
00:47:53,530 --> 00:47:55,820
I'll hear the piano right now.
Be seated.

323
00:47:56,580 --> 00:47:58,170
Why don't you encourage him, Neena?

324
00:47:58,690 --> 00:47:59,930
Please sing.

325
00:48:02,510 --> 00:48:03,820
What should I sing?

326
00:48:05,890 --> 00:48:13,890
I want to hear a romantic song.
Whatever type it may be.

327
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:17,980
But it should be a romantic song.
Please sing.

328
00:51:14,470 --> 00:51:22,080
Wonderful! Only a heartbroken person
can rightly appreciate such songs.

329
00:51:22,130 --> 00:51:27,090
You should ask me what I saw
in his enchanting songs...

330
00:51:27,790 --> 00:51:32,520
his mesmerizing lyrics,
and his heartrending stories.

331
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:37,310
- Did you see a form of God?
- Yes.

332
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:48,350
He was the only one missing.
He too has found his way here.

333
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,250
Who is he?

334
00:51:53,530 --> 00:51:56,580
Professor Devdas Dharamdas Trivedi.

335
00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:04,360
A scholar of literature
and philosophies.

336
00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:10,540
- He's a mobile trouble.
- How did you end up with him?

337
00:52:11,530 --> 00:52:14,260
He used to play with me
during father's time.

338
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:17,290
Now he calls himself my guru!

339
00:52:18,150 --> 00:52:22,180
He says that he taught me when
I was fooling around on swings.

340
00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:25,660
He doesn't even know A, B, C.
But he insists on being called 'Professor'.

341
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:30,590
- Of which subject is he a professor?
- Nobody knows.

342
00:52:30,870 --> 00:52:33,420
He takes out frogs from hats
and snakes from bags.

343
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,640
Call him in.
Let me also watch the fun.

344
00:52:35,670 --> 00:52:39,440
Don't you ever do that?
Once he steps in...

345
00:52:39,630 --> 00:52:43,910
he won't step out for years.
Better to slip off to the club.

346
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:45,600
Tell him we're not here.

347
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:49,780
We are here!
I am right here, Professor.

348
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,930
Welcome, Professor!

349
00:52:52,990 --> 00:53:00,400
A sin! What a big sin!
You'll have to atone for it, Raju!

350
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:04,290
How could you forget
what I've taught you?

351
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:06,900
My heart is feeling so hurt.

352
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:10,350
Place your hand on my head
and take a pledge that...

353
00:53:10,910 --> 00:53:14,480
you will never lie.
Have you taken the pledge?

354
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:19,430
It's your good fortune
I've come to visit you.

355
00:53:20,870 --> 00:53:25,530
I was dying to see you, Raju!

356
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:30,910
The taxi is parked outside.
Arrange to send the fare.

357
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:36,100
And arrange for an airy room
where I can stay.

358
00:53:36,510 --> 00:53:38,950
- This is not my house, Master.
- Calling me a master again?

359
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:47,780
Rather, you should address
me as a professor!

360
00:53:55,550 --> 00:53:57,140
Glad to meet you.

361
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:00,710
Who's she?

362
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:07,000
Have you gone mad?

363
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:12,280
You are you inviting
trouble for yourself?

364
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:15,590
That's what I tell him.
But he refuses to listen.

365
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:17,980
If he doesn't listen,
he'll be sorry some day.

366
00:54:18,430 --> 00:54:20,840
But I will fulfill my duty.

367
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:26,750
I will continue to explain to him
as long as I'm a guest here.

368
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:29,880
But you don't have to be
formal with me.

369
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:38,270
Just remember that in food,
I hate salt, spices and onion.

370
00:54:39,490 --> 00:54:46,130
As for my room,
let it be a bit airy.

371
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:48,900
Who's that gentleman?

372
00:54:50,950 --> 00:54:52,880
He's Mr. Dilip, Neena's friend.

373
00:54:53,510 --> 00:54:56,420
The first principle
itself is wrong.

374
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:59,140
Either get married,
or just be friends.

375
00:54:59,740 --> 00:55:02,690
One cannot compose a
western tune on a harmonium.

376
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:09,230
Show him the airy room upstairs.

377
00:55:09,830 --> 00:55:12,540
- And I take precautions in my food.
- Yes. Keep that in mind.

378
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:42,610
I got a chance to talk to you
alone after such a long time.

379
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:45,040
But your eyes are
searching for Dilip.

380
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:49,010
Tell me, is Dilip your secretary,
your bodyguard, or...

381
00:55:49,150 --> 00:55:51,500
Are you envious?
We aren't even married yet.

382
00:55:52,050 --> 00:55:57,690
One is worried only before marriage.
After marriage, why worry?

383
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:01,570
Then everybody will know that this
building belongs to Mr. Rajan.

384
00:56:03,290 --> 00:56:04,740
It's natural to feel jealous.

385
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:07,686
He's such a good person that
even if I were in your place...

386
00:56:07,710 --> 00:56:09,080
I 'd have been jealous, too.

387
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:12,170
You might feel that way
about him, not I.

388
00:56:12,610 --> 00:56:18,280
While in London,
girls used to swoon over me.

389
00:56:18,690 --> 00:56:19,780
Really?

390
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:31,390
Mr. Dilip, while the hunters
are on their hunting spree...

391
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:33,410
how about a round of cards?

392
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:42,070
Would you like to play cards?
What do you want to do?

393
00:56:43,930 --> 00:56:45,340
You want to dance?

394
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:53,990
But you aren't married yet.
With whom will you dance?

395
00:56:54,380 --> 00:56:55,820
Where's your wife?

396
00:56:57,560 --> 00:57:02,270
- I'll dance with Neena.
- You too will dance with Neena?

397
00:57:05,490 --> 00:57:08,230
- That's the practice in society.
- To hell with society!

398
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:17,040
O God! May the earth break open,
and I sink under it.

399
00:57:18,230 --> 00:57:22,580
I cannot see this living hell.

400
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:31,036
A girl is dancing with her arms
around another man's waist.

401
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:33,170
What the hell is wrong
with you people?

402
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:35,950
How can such a society be yours?

403
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:44,470
Those who behaved this way,
have packed their bags and left.

404
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:47,270
You too are wearing
this imported suit.

405
00:57:49,210 --> 00:57:52,940
Who's talking to you?
This suit doesn't belong to me.

406
00:57:58,770 --> 00:58:01,110
Where were you all this time?

407
00:58:02,450 --> 00:58:03,970
I was busy with my work.

408
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:06,560
I don't like your acting
haughty all the while.

409
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:08,460
- Let's dance.
- Some other time.

410
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:29,680
I've to visit Uncle Dinesh
at least for five minutes.

411
00:58:30,790 --> 00:58:32,540
- Otherwise he'll be angry.
- Let's go.

412
00:58:33,410 --> 00:58:37,300
- But how to get rid of that trouble?
- Don't worry.

413
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:38,830
I'll fix him right away.

414
00:58:43,250 --> 00:58:46,500
I'm unable to make out whether
you are back in India...

415
00:58:46,750 --> 00:58:49,270
or whether I've flown
into some club in London.

416
00:58:49,590 --> 00:58:51,150
I arrived only today.

417
00:58:51,310 --> 00:58:52,930
I was just planning
to visit your place.

418
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:56,960
You lived in London for so many
years. Did you ever think of me?

419
00:58:57,360 --> 00:59:02,670
He even forgot me,
who made him what he is.

420
00:59:02,930 --> 00:59:04,540
Then how could he
have remembered you?

421
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:09,110
Rajan, who's she?

422
00:59:09,210 --> 00:59:12,520
Instead, why don't you
introduce yourself?

423
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:35,030
Since when did you start wearing
sarees instead of frocks?

424
00:59:45,550 --> 00:59:47,430
Would you dance with me, Professor?

425
00:59:47,830 --> 00:59:51,690
I? And dance?
Even my father never danced.

426
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:57,180
One doesn't refuse a dance
in society.

427
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:59,590
We'll be insulted, Professor.
Please go on.

428
00:59:59,650 --> 01:00:00,870
No, no.

429
01:00:39,140 --> 01:00:40,580
- Are the meals ready?
- Yes.

430
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:43,100
- Has Mr. Dilip returned?
- Yes. He's in his room.

431
01:00:43,570 --> 01:00:45,100
Hiralal has gone to inform him.

432
01:00:46,460 --> 01:00:48,100
Your trouble is back again.

433
01:00:48,930 --> 01:00:51,910
- Where are you running away?
- Where were you lost?

434
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:53,480
I was telephoning you.

435
01:00:53,810 --> 01:00:56,980
You pushed me into hell,
and then left me there all alone.

436
01:00:57,530 --> 01:01:02,260
What if I hadn't got a taxi?
What would I've done then?

437
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:04,490
Send the fare for the taxi.

438
01:01:04,860 --> 01:01:08,690
- Have you finished your meals?
- No, we were waiting for you.

439
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:10,606
Yes, of course.

440
01:01:10,630 --> 01:01:13,510
Mr. Dilip has said that he isn't
feeling well. You may eat the meals.

441
01:01:13,730 --> 01:01:15,390
All right.
Come on. Let's eat.

442
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:22,160
O God! How should one rid
oneself of this trouble?

443
01:01:23,490 --> 01:01:24,940
- Come on.
- You carry on.

444
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:26,590
I'll go and see
what's keeping Dilip.

445
01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:30,320
- No, I won't go there alone.
- Why? Are you scared of the guru?

446
01:01:39,830 --> 01:01:41,220
How are you feeling?

447
01:01:43,770 --> 01:01:45,370
At the club too,
you left us behind.

448
01:01:47,980 --> 01:01:50,990
My heart is asking some
worrying questions.

449
01:01:53,740 --> 01:01:55,530
I couldn't find any answer.

450
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:58,270
Ask me. Perhaps I can
offer some answers.

451
01:01:59,990 --> 01:02:02,010
I won't be able to express
my dilemma to you.

452
01:02:03,460 --> 01:02:05,160
Go ahead. Mr. Rajan
must be expecting you.

453
01:02:05,580 --> 01:02:09,230
Let him. I too have
waited for him for years.

454
01:02:10,990 --> 01:02:12,320
Waited for him?

455
01:02:13,580 --> 01:02:19,800
But you never mentioned
about it earlier?

456
01:02:22,070 --> 01:02:25,020
It happened so many times that
I was about to tell you about it.

457
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:29,490
Remember when you came to my
home for the first time...

458
01:02:30,470 --> 01:02:37,530
I told you that one who
waits knows how pleasurable it is.

459
01:02:38,730 --> 01:02:43,880
At Sheela's party too, I'd said that
the lightning had already struck.

460
01:02:45,140 --> 01:02:50,480
You also said I shouldn't
be under any wrong impression.

461
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:56,920
You weren't my girlfriend that I'd
have told you about my love story.

462
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:59,920
But now you've become
such a friend...

463
01:03:00,890 --> 01:03:02,760
who knows everything
about my heart.

464
01:03:04,750 --> 01:03:07,690
One fine day, when I was
travelling in a car...

465
01:03:43,220 --> 01:03:44,490
A juggler, are you?

466
01:03:51,030 --> 01:03:52,200
Who are you?

467
01:03:52,950 --> 01:03:56,230
I'm a juggler.
I've come to trap a snake.

468
01:04:00,770 --> 01:04:03,910
Aren't you ashamed of making
a fool of a girl?

469
01:04:05,490 --> 01:04:08,960
You're a girl?
I thought you were a boy.

470
01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:10,926
You don't appear to be
a decent fellow.

471
01:04:10,950 --> 01:04:15,750
Can I help you in any way?

472
01:04:16,100 --> 01:04:18,400
I don't want your help.
Go away from here.

473
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:37,320
I wonder why girls these days
have to drive cars.

474
01:04:39,690 --> 01:04:41,100
- What's your name?
- Neena.

475
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:43,600
Sit in the car. I'll fix it.

476
01:04:52,390 --> 01:04:55,750
- You appear to be a good driver.
- Will I get a job?

477
01:04:58,150 --> 01:04:59,400
Do come home.

478
01:05:01,950 --> 01:05:06,830
One fine day, when I was riding
a horse, he saw me and followed me.

479
01:05:43,220 --> 01:05:44,500
What's the matter, Neena?

480
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:49,800
Nothing. I was late, so I thought
you must've had your breakfast.

481
01:05:49,860 --> 01:05:51,260
No, you aren't too late.

482
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:55,326
What's the matter, Heera?

483
01:05:55,350 --> 01:05:57,050
The driver you asked
to come has arrived.

484
01:05:57,290 --> 01:06:00,020
I didn't call any driver.

485
01:06:01,340 --> 01:06:02,990
I'll change and come, Daddy.

486
01:06:05,630 --> 01:06:09,180
If you didn't call him, how could
he come here asking for you?

487
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:14,810
Yes, Daddy. I had asked him to come.
I forgot to tell you about him.

488
01:06:15,250 --> 01:06:18,430
Go and tell him to come
some other day.

489
01:06:18,660 --> 01:06:20,260
One doesn't find good drivers
these days.

490
01:06:20,460 --> 01:06:22,460
Go and call him. Or somebody
else might employ him.

491
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:27,720
You may speak to him.
I'll go and change.

492
01:06:27,820 --> 01:06:30,390
No, be seated. Since you have
called him, you should talk.

493
01:06:33,330 --> 01:06:34,750
You've been called inside.

494
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:44,150
Stop! Come here!

495
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:51,510
Greetings.

496
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:54,970
Aren't you the son of
the late Mr. Dayal?

497
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:57,910
- Yes.
- Be seated.

498
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,360
Have breakfast before you go.

499
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:09,520
Please put less sugar.

500
01:07:13,540 --> 01:07:18,570
Give him adequate breakfast
and fix the salary.

501
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:22,490
He's a good driver.
I too like him.

502
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:38,600
Do you promise to keep me ensconced
in your heart all your life?

503
01:07:38,950 --> 01:07:42,620
I have already established
your image in my heart...

504
01:07:42,890 --> 01:07:44,910
and I even make offerings
of love flowers.

505
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:48,880
Really? You mean I am your God?
Then offer me flowers.

506
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:50,660
Where do I get flowers?

507
01:07:51,030 --> 01:07:53,540
These are all wild flowers.
They don't have any fragrance.

508
01:07:56,210 --> 01:08:00,650
Even if you touch paper flowers,
they'll be filled with fragrance.

509
01:08:01,850 --> 01:08:05,320
You had better be careful.
They're delicate and might be crushed.

510
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:10,170
This flower will be my support
all my life now.

511
01:08:14,210 --> 01:08:17,870
I'm going abroad.
Will you wait for me?

512
01:08:19,819 --> 01:08:22,849
Once a priest offers flowers
to his deity...

513
01:08:23,689 --> 01:08:25,779
it is never offered
again to anybody else.

514
01:08:27,710 --> 01:08:29,750
No matter even if I have
to wait all my life.

515
01:08:34,620 --> 01:08:39,380
What's the matter, Dilip?
I hope you are fine.

516
01:08:39,470 --> 01:08:40,950
Should we send for a doctor?

517
01:08:42,340 --> 01:08:44,610
Will you offer food, or
should I return home?

518
01:08:45,180 --> 01:08:48,130
Just imagine.
I've returned only today.

519
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:49,850
And I've been out all day.

520
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:53,480
Mother must've even filed a
police report that I'm missing.

521
01:08:55,100 --> 01:08:56,490
Come on now!

522
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:11,300
I'm starving, while
they are being so stylish.

523
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:13,230
And here, they're all
standing like statues.

524
01:09:14,359 --> 01:09:22,359
I'm starving. At least,
offer me a glass of water.

525
01:09:24,700 --> 01:09:29,870
What? Nobody is listening?
You'll all be dismissed today.

526
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:32,270
Or else, immediately bring me food.

527
01:09:37,310 --> 01:09:40,340
- You haven't started yet?
- What should I've eaten? This house?

528
01:09:41,290 --> 01:09:42,930
Even these things have
a lot of vitamins.

529
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:01,580
Please begin.

530
01:10:02,060 --> 01:10:04,580
Excuse me,
but I've to get home soon.

531
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:08,060
Otherwise, mother will impose
a 24-hour curfew on me.

532
01:10:08,650 --> 01:10:10,070
Bring meals for him too.

533
01:10:10,590 --> 01:10:12,470
We're mistaken. The cook
didn't prepare meals...

534
01:10:12,660 --> 01:10:14,020
as per his requirements.

535
01:10:14,590 --> 01:10:17,490
It doesn't matter. I don't follow
restrictions when I am hungry.

536
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:21,000
I eat anything.

537
01:10:32,670 --> 01:10:35,360
So how are you, Mr. Dilip?

538
01:10:38,370 --> 01:10:40,800
I'm speaking to you.
How are you?

539
01:10:43,390 --> 01:10:45,930
- There's pain.
- Pain? Where?

540
01:10:49,340 --> 01:10:50,600
In your heart?

541
01:10:53,050 --> 01:10:54,340
In the head.

542
01:10:55,210 --> 01:10:57,600
A headache is very dangerous.

543
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:00,580
Hold on!

544
01:11:06,740 --> 01:11:13,420
Here, drink this.

545
01:11:13,850 --> 01:11:16,690
By morning, neither will you
survive, nor your pain.

546
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:52,640
Where is he?

547
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:58,460
Who? Dilip? Your eyes must have
been searching for him!

548
01:11:58,860 --> 01:12:00,100
Where is he?

549
01:12:02,270 --> 01:12:06,500
I won't be able to dance.
It should be the same atmosphere.

550
01:12:07,220 --> 01:12:11,460
He should play the piano, you should
stand in the front, and I dance.

551
01:12:11,820 --> 01:12:14,900
Let me also hear which atmosphere
are you talking about.

552
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:17,350
He's become envious. It has
nothing to do with you.

553
01:12:17,510 --> 01:12:19,320
It's a secret between us.

554
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:21,050
As you wish.

555
01:12:21,710 --> 01:12:23,790
He's not to be seen.

556
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:29,430
Look after the guests, Rajan.
I'll find him and bring him here.

557
01:12:30,580 --> 01:12:31,680
All right.

558
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:37,980
When will the dancing begin?
People have been praising you.

559
01:12:38,060 --> 01:12:42,370
How can she?
Her Guru has vanished!

560
01:12:42,430 --> 01:12:48,780
I still haven't met your father.
He must've come to the party today.

561
01:12:48,990 --> 01:12:50,720
Why don't you introduce me to him?

562
01:12:50,860 --> 01:12:53,490
No, he's gone to Kashi
on a pilgrimage.

563
01:12:55,720 --> 01:13:00,030
Rajan, you youngsters will
start dancing shortly.

564
01:13:00,630 --> 01:13:02,030
I'm an old man.
Let me go.

565
01:13:02,110 --> 01:13:04,650
No, Uncle. Speak to
Neena once she arrives.

566
01:13:05,030 --> 01:13:06,950
Who's he?

567
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:11,360
He's my Uncle.
Sheela's daddy!

568
01:13:14,910 --> 01:13:16,350
What a naughty girl!

569
01:13:16,710 --> 01:13:19,150
Such deeds of your daughter have
made my heart get infatuated.

570
01:13:19,220 --> 01:13:20,440
What nonsense!

571
01:13:20,900 --> 01:13:24,610
Let's be seated. I wanted to
speak about her marriage.

572
01:13:24,670 --> 01:13:27,560
Who are you? Don't you know where
one discusses such things?

573
01:13:27,790 --> 01:13:29,590
I'm a straightforward person.

574
01:13:30,750 --> 01:13:35,520
My son is in love with your Sheela,
while Sheela is all praises for him.

575
01:13:35,980 --> 01:13:38,800
If you and I don't finalize
this alliance...

576
01:13:39,060 --> 01:13:40,446
the two of them will
seal the matter themselves.

577
01:13:40,470 --> 01:13:43,330
If Sheela marries your son,
I will shoot her dead.

578
01:13:43,450 --> 01:13:44,980
- Why?
- What's your son's name?

579
01:13:47,130 --> 01:13:50,530
Dilip? Neena's partner?
You are his father?

580
01:13:52,340 --> 01:13:54,440
You're quite an
interesting person!

581
01:13:55,150 --> 01:13:58,330
Sheela is like your daughter!
You may take her whenever you like.

582
01:13:59,390 --> 01:14:01,410
Why to delay an
auspicious development?

583
01:14:02,170 --> 01:14:03,770
The 23rd of this month
is decided then.

584
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:10,360
You outdo even women
in getting dressed up.

585
01:14:11,170 --> 01:14:12,910
Everybody is waiting for you
at the party.

586
01:14:13,810 --> 01:14:15,280
The piano is lying silent.

587
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:18,040
And everybody is keen
to watch Sheela dance.

588
01:14:18,270 --> 01:14:19,820
What a strange night this is.

589
01:14:21,990 --> 01:14:23,590
Everything in the world
is so restless.

590
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:32,260
I'm also taking my restless heart
far away so that it calms down.

591
01:14:34,890 --> 01:14:35,970
Where?

592
01:14:37,970 --> 01:14:39,300
Wherever destiny takes me.

593
01:14:40,290 --> 01:14:43,720
What's wrong with you?
I won't let you go.

594
01:14:47,580 --> 01:14:51,170
- You cannot stop me now.
- Don't be crazy. Come to your senses.

595
01:14:51,290 --> 01:14:54,610
I've come to my senses.
That's why I'm going.

596
01:14:58,190 --> 01:14:59,620
Have I been mistaken?

597
01:15:01,410 --> 01:15:05,600
Not you. I've been mistaken.

598
01:15:09,740 --> 01:15:10,810
What's your mistake?

599
01:15:14,670 --> 01:15:16,070
That I love you.

600
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:32,010
Why did Dilip go away?

601
01:15:38,690 --> 01:15:41,370
I had already told you that Rajan
has taken a place in my heart...

602
01:15:42,060 --> 01:15:44,580
where, except for God, I can't
make anybody else more important.

603
01:15:45,470 --> 01:15:47,030
Take back your words.

604
01:15:47,430 --> 01:15:49,010
Say that you didn't
say what you did.

605
01:15:49,070 --> 01:15:51,710
Once an arrow is shot, the
wound cannot be healed.

606
01:15:52,070 --> 01:15:55,490
I have always looked upon you
as my friend. I never loved you.

607
01:15:56,150 --> 01:15:57,670
Don't stir the suppressed fire.

608
01:15:58,970 --> 01:16:04,040
Before its flames reach out to you,
it's better that I leave.

609
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:05,950
Go away! You're most welcome!

610
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:08,960
You think that I will hold you
back fearing a bad name for me?

611
01:16:09,330 --> 01:16:12,586
Go away! If my getting a bad name
can heal your wounds...

612
01:16:12,610 --> 01:16:16,380
I'm most willing. Go away.
I love nobody but Rajan.

613
01:16:28,630 --> 01:16:30,800
When I'm no more,
you'll remember my words.

614
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:34,800
I wonder why I don't like
so much freedom.

615
01:16:35,970 --> 01:16:38,000
Invite him if you wish.

616
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:42,860
You are still sitting here? I thought
you'd gone to fetch Dilip.

617
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:45,810
Look at your face.

618
01:16:45,950 --> 01:16:48,130
People will think that
I married you forcefully.

619
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:51,980
Wait Rajan. I want to
tell you something.

620
01:16:52,260 --> 01:16:53,680
All right. Go ahead.

621
01:16:59,590 --> 01:17:02,480
- Daddy had once said...
- I know that!

622
01:17:02,590 --> 01:17:04,000
He said it in my presence.

623
01:17:04,030 --> 01:17:06,750
He said that he likes the driver,
and that you should fix my salary.

624
01:17:09,540 --> 01:17:11,660
Look, Daddy! Even if Neena
doesn't like it...

625
01:17:11,850 --> 01:17:13,770
I'll place you elsewhere anyway.

626
01:17:14,230 --> 01:17:17,190
Whenever there's a joyous occasion,
Neena comes here and starts weeping.

627
01:17:17,290 --> 01:17:19,870
And upsets the whole program.
Explain to her. Otherwise...

628
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:16,230
I love you!

629
01:23:21,850 --> 01:23:24,700
I love you!

630
01:23:32,230 --> 01:23:35,180
If you continue to think
along such lines...

631
01:23:35,580 --> 01:23:38,250
then society won't
allow you to survive.

632
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:56,020
I see! So the new bride
is feeling shy.

633
01:23:56,370 --> 01:23:58,320
Bravo! Carry on feeling shy!

634
01:23:59,670 --> 01:24:02,360
It's also necessary to carry out
the ritual of feeling shy.

635
01:24:11,470 --> 01:24:19,470
This enchanting night,
and riveting breeze.

636
01:24:21,670 --> 01:24:27,430
Why're you sitting like
an old-fashioned bride?

637
01:24:28,530 --> 01:24:32,590
You may pull over
your saree too.

638
01:24:37,380 --> 01:24:39,090
Your place is in my heart, Neena.

639
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:01,580
Fruits? Tea?

640
01:25:02,050 --> 01:25:03,240
Letters, sir!

641
01:25:12,860 --> 01:25:14,890
Give me my letter.

642
01:25:16,030 --> 01:25:17,430
- First salute me!
- I won't.

643
01:25:18,620 --> 01:25:19,840
Salute me!

644
01:25:21,230 --> 01:25:23,840
Gosh! Why don't you cut
your finger nails?

645
01:25:24,510 --> 01:25:25,830
I don't. Because I don't want to.

646
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:42,940
'Neena, he loves somebody else'

647
01:25:53,370 --> 01:25:54,840
Anything special in the letter?

648
01:25:55,380 --> 01:25:57,420
Don't hide anything from me.
Let me know too.

649
01:25:59,470 --> 01:26:01,090
Read it yourself.
It's from Sheela.

650
01:26:06,490 --> 01:26:07,840
Did you read it?

651
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:11,630
If you wish,
this marriage can take place.

652
01:26:12,580 --> 01:26:13,710
How?

653
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:15,336
I don't know that.

654
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:16,990
Let's have breakfast.
We've to go out.

655
01:26:20,310 --> 01:26:21,900
Why don't you get married?

656
01:26:24,190 --> 01:26:26,050
Because I love you.

657
01:26:27,740 --> 01:26:32,360
I'm already married. I don't
love anybody but Rajan.

658
01:26:33,090 --> 01:26:35,000
You love me, Neena.

659
01:26:37,090 --> 01:26:40,040
The kind of love which sometimes
a person doesn't even realize.

660
01:26:42,330 --> 01:26:45,070
To understand it, one has
to merge oneself in it.

661
01:26:47,720 --> 01:26:49,490
Have you ever tried
to understand it?

662
01:26:49,670 --> 01:26:56,170
No, I don't want to understand it.
Rajan is my God.

663
01:26:57,560 --> 01:27:01,170
Did you hear?
Rajan is my God.

664
01:27:13,460 --> 01:27:16,230
- Hide me in your heart.
- What's the matter?

665
01:27:17,020 --> 01:27:18,520
I had become somewhat scared.

666
01:27:23,450 --> 01:27:24,750
What did you write?

667
01:27:27,220 --> 01:27:29,880
'You haven't sent for your goods
for a week.'

668
01:27:30,070 --> 01:27:32,320
'So we are having to face
a lot of losses.'

669
01:27:32,590 --> 01:27:36,220
'If you don't collect your
goods within 3 days...'

670
01:27:36,350 --> 01:27:39,010
- 'according to the contract...'
- We will cancel your order.

671
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:47,140
He works all day long. I tell him
to care for his health too.

672
01:27:47,700 --> 01:27:49,020
Please be seated.

673
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:51,990
What brings you here?

674
01:27:52,090 --> 01:27:54,820
I was forced to come since
you don't visit us.

675
01:27:55,460 --> 01:27:58,590
You didn't even attend the party.
Sheela was very upset.

676
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:00,600
She hosted the party
mainly for your sake.

677
01:28:01,580 --> 01:28:05,130
I regret it myself. But because of
some work, I couldn't attend.

678
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:07,176
Ask Sheela on my behalf
to please forgive me.

679
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:09,140
I won't interfere between
the two of you.

680
01:28:09,650 --> 01:28:12,090
She's very upset. Come and
appease her yourself.

681
01:28:12,700 --> 01:28:14,536
All right. I'll come personally
when I find some time.

682
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:18,560
In fact, you should visit her
at least twice daily.

683
01:28:19,110 --> 01:28:20,700
She can't come to you now.

684
01:28:21,020 --> 01:28:22,830
Can't you even understand
such a small thing?

685
01:28:26,040 --> 01:28:28,440
Why? I hope everything is fine.
How is Sheela?

686
01:28:29,290 --> 01:28:31,670
Ever since your Daddy has
finalized about it...

687
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:34,340
she has even stopped coming
to me out of shyness.

688
01:28:34,410 --> 01:28:36,800
Daddy? My Daddy?

689
01:28:45,960 --> 01:28:47,346
- It's confirmed.
- What's confirmed?

690
01:28:47,370 --> 01:28:48,690
Speak on.

691
01:28:52,590 --> 01:28:54,880
Don't make statements
which hurt the heart.

692
01:28:56,140 --> 01:28:58,310
What can I do? I'm mistaken.

693
01:28:59,330 --> 01:29:03,560
Since I've given my heart, you may
harass me as much as you like.

694
01:29:04,430 --> 01:29:07,506
But you had better remember
that after the marriage...

695
01:29:07,530 --> 01:29:09,310
I will seek my revenge.

696
01:29:10,220 --> 01:29:15,150
Perhaps this is why you didn't
tell Daddy about marriage yourself.

697
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:17,310
You conveyed it through D.D.T.

698
01:29:24,030 --> 01:29:25,830
Yes, dear?

699
01:29:26,230 --> 01:29:28,156
I want to speak to you about
something. Come to this room.

700
01:29:28,180 --> 01:29:30,970
Whatever you want to say,
say it in his presence.

701
01:29:31,140 --> 01:29:33,480
Excuse me, I want to speak
to you in private.

702
01:29:33,550 --> 01:29:36,170
I know what you are going
to do and tell me.

703
01:29:36,550 --> 01:29:39,250
Please wait here. Don't go away.
He's a very insistent boy.

704
01:29:42,060 --> 01:29:44,890
Why're you closing the door? Let it
be open. Let the breeze come in.

705
01:29:46,020 --> 01:29:47,460
Why did you do that?

706
01:29:47,540 --> 01:29:50,680
Speak from a distance.
Don't be angry with me.

707
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:52,636
- Speak with some understanding.
- I should be understanding?

708
01:29:52,660 --> 01:29:56,540
What wrong have I done? Whatever
I've done, it is in your interest.

709
01:29:56,960 --> 01:29:59,650
Sheela is always so romantically
inclined towards you.

710
01:29:59,930 --> 01:30:01,576
I noticed that, and
finalised your marriage.

711
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:03,070
Who are you to finalise my marriage?

712
01:30:03,290 --> 01:30:09,410
One makes even a donkey a father.
Am I worse than a donkey?

713
01:30:09,680 --> 01:30:12,280
You're worse than that since you
played with a decent man's honor.

714
01:30:12,430 --> 01:30:16,580
- Know how he will feel if I refuse?
- Then marry Sheela.

715
01:30:17,610 --> 01:30:19,000
I don't love Sheela.

716
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:22,340
- Then whom do you love?
- I love rocks.

717
01:30:22,570 --> 01:30:25,120
- Rocks could break your head.
- You had better hear this.

718
01:30:25,700 --> 01:30:30,150
You might be Mr. Rajan's friend.
But I cannot tolerate such a joke.

719
01:30:31,150 --> 01:30:32,360
Get lost!

720
01:30:33,450 --> 01:30:37,510
All right. I am going. But remember,
you'll regret it one day.

721
01:30:48,710 --> 01:30:52,700
Why don't you marry Sheela?
Why cause suspicion to Rajan?

722
01:30:53,230 --> 01:30:56,860
You should get married to Sheela.

723
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:11,410
It's been 4 or 5 months here now.
I feel bored. Let's return to the city.

724
01:32:11,720 --> 01:32:15,130
- Why?
- Because...

725
01:32:15,470 --> 01:32:17,540
here you feel scared at night,
during the day.

726
01:32:18,170 --> 01:32:19,890
Is it within my control
not to feel feared?

727
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:24,700
- Why not leave this place?
- I don't want to go to the city.

728
01:32:25,300 --> 01:32:27,080
I feel terrified even
thinking about it.

729
01:32:30,200 --> 01:32:33,170
Why? ls there some ghost there
who would bite you?

730
01:32:34,640 --> 01:32:36,230
Why're you talking such nonsense?

731
01:32:38,410 --> 01:32:39,590
Nonsense?

732
01:32:43,100 --> 01:32:45,260
It's a question of somebody's life.

733
01:32:46,650 --> 01:32:47,790
Whose life?

734
01:32:50,610 --> 01:32:55,020
Poor Sheela's. Why doesn't
Dilip get married to her?

735
01:32:55,830 --> 01:32:57,320
He might not love her.

736
01:32:59,320 --> 01:33:00,600
Then whom does he love?

737
01:33:00,910 --> 01:33:06,050
I have married you willingly,
not because of any pressure.

738
01:33:07,130 --> 01:33:09,080
I regret you don't
understand me even now.

739
01:33:10,050 --> 01:33:13,350
Do you realise how much you've
insulted me and my love?

740
01:33:14,230 --> 01:33:16,970
Do you realise how much
you've hurt me now?

741
01:33:17,860 --> 01:33:20,560
I could never have imagined that
you'd say such a thing.

742
01:34:27,220 --> 01:34:28,580
Go to sleep now.

743
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:34,530
Carry on playing it all night.
Still, I won't talk to you.

744
01:35:51,010 --> 01:35:53,230
Enough. Enough.
Why're you making all the noise?

745
01:35:59,160 --> 01:36:00,450
Stop this noise!

746
01:36:06,390 --> 01:36:08,960
Don't stop it. I will break
your instrument today.

747
01:36:34,440 --> 01:36:36,610
Snake, snake, snake!

748
01:40:37,240 --> 01:40:40,140
Rajan. Congratulations, it's a girl.

749
01:40:40,500 --> 01:40:44,740
A girl! My daughter?
And how's Neena?

750
01:40:45,420 --> 01:40:46,420
Very happy.

751
01:40:46,780 --> 01:40:48,110
Not now. In half an hour

752
01:40:51,740 --> 01:40:53,690
Wow! She's my...!

753
01:41:04,570 --> 01:41:06,060
Congratulations on the
little Neena!

754
01:41:06,690 --> 01:41:08,610
You've won, while I've lost.

755
01:41:10,200 --> 01:41:13,340
- Then why did we argue?
- I was mistaken.

756
01:41:16,200 --> 01:41:19,230
- Do you admit that I'm your God?
- Yes, I do.

757
01:41:21,560 --> 01:41:27,170
What condition are you in?
You're wearing the tie wrongly.

758
01:41:29,170 --> 01:41:30,890
You didn't even put on
a flower on the coat?

759
01:41:31,200 --> 01:41:34,220
How could I? After all,
you have spoiled me.

760
01:41:38,610 --> 01:41:40,440
I can't live even for a
moment without you.

761
01:41:42,810 --> 01:41:44,970
Remaining away from you
for a few moments...

762
01:41:46,590 --> 01:41:48,110
I felt as if I'd lost
everything I had.

763
01:41:50,010 --> 01:41:56,120
And that I'd been left
helpless, all alone.

764
01:41:57,220 --> 01:42:01,420
Who are you talking to?
I've already died in your thoughts.

765
01:42:01,750 --> 01:42:04,130
And I've died much before you.

766
01:42:04,400 --> 01:42:07,530
Rather, somebody should ask me
how a dead person is.

767
01:42:07,740 --> 01:42:09,790
Here comes another sick person!

768
01:42:10,130 --> 01:42:17,670
Ask me how she spent every day
waiting for you.

769
01:42:18,540 --> 01:42:22,330
She kept her love for you
hidden for years.

770
01:42:22,760 --> 01:42:26,316
While just because you had to stay
away for a few years...

771
01:42:26,340 --> 01:42:28,060
you started complaining!

772
01:42:28,630 --> 01:42:32,620
Neena, men are very dangerous.

773
01:42:33,020 --> 01:42:37,390
Never tell them that you love them.
Otherwise they won't give you a damn.

774
01:43:01,260 --> 01:43:03,140
How can you act like a toy for her
all day long?

775
01:43:04,230 --> 01:43:07,930
You've ruined her schedule.
She neither eats nor sleeps.

776
01:43:08,310 --> 01:43:12,870
- Come on. Go to sleep now.
- Why did you make her cry?

777
01:43:13,320 --> 01:43:15,940
She'll cry when she's hungry.
She'll sleep when she's tired.

778
01:43:16,150 --> 01:43:19,890
- That's how the child gets spoiled!
- She's such a little child!

779
01:43:21,950 --> 01:43:24,350
Don't you feel envious because
she loves me more?

780
01:43:24,430 --> 01:43:27,300
Yes, I feel envious! Let her
sleep now. Or we'll fight!

781
01:43:31,770 --> 01:43:38,040
You know that I enjoy fulfilling
her whims and fancies...

782
01:43:38,440 --> 01:43:41,810
- as much I love your style.
- But I don't like your love at all.

783
01:43:42,090 --> 01:43:44,240
How can I bear to see my child crying?

784
01:43:44,520 --> 01:43:47,036
Didn't your Daddy fulfill
all your desires?

785
01:43:47,060 --> 01:43:48,520
That's what I don't want.

786
01:43:50,710 --> 01:43:53,240
How should I explain to you
what I feel?

787
01:43:54,210 --> 01:43:56,360
Why I feel so scared by
your abundant love?

788
01:43:56,480 --> 01:43:57,826
You can keep feeling scared.

789
01:43:57,850 --> 01:43:59,830
We'll go to the city
to celebrate her birthday.

790
01:44:00,150 --> 01:44:01,240
City?

791
01:44:02,830 --> 01:44:04,990
Why do you lose your temper
at the mention of the city?

792
01:44:05,400 --> 01:44:08,260
We've been living here for 2 years.
We won't stay here any longer.

793
01:44:08,300 --> 01:44:12,520
I feel terrified at the thought
of the city. I don't do well there.

794
01:44:13,240 --> 01:44:14,960
Don't you ever mention
the city again!

795
01:44:23,200 --> 01:44:24,500
You are upset?

796
01:44:27,520 --> 01:44:31,310
You want to go the city?
All right. I am ready.

797
01:44:33,500 --> 01:44:36,526
After a long wait, finally the day
has come when I can hand over...

798
01:44:36,550 --> 01:44:38,780
all the responsibilities
and become a free person.

799
01:44:40,630 --> 01:44:44,340
Before your marriage, I was under the
false impression that you loved me.

800
01:44:45,400 --> 01:44:46,720
On the wedding night...

801
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:49,140
when I expressed my love
for you for the first time...

802
01:44:50,110 --> 01:44:52,540
I realized then that
you loved Rajan.

803
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:55,510
I would've left on that very day.

804
01:44:56,260 --> 01:44:58,620
But I stayed back fearing that
you would get a bad name.

805
01:45:00,050 --> 01:45:02,450
The fifty per cent share of your
business that you gave me...

806
01:45:03,540 --> 01:45:06,320
I gift it to your daughter
on her first birthday.

807
01:48:22,590 --> 01:48:27,260
Dilip, everything about you is
becoming a new problem for me.

808
01:48:28,360 --> 01:48:30,120
You don't realise how sad I am.

809
01:48:31,420 --> 01:48:33,970
Why are you posing problems for me,
Rajan and my daughter?

810
01:48:35,260 --> 01:48:36,950
Why don't you marry Sheela?

811
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:42,300
Do you want to destroy my family
life and watch the fun?

812
01:48:43,910 --> 01:48:45,160
All right then.

813
01:48:54,720 --> 01:48:58,260
Congratulations, Neena. This is
a gift on your daughter's birthday.

814
01:48:59,090 --> 01:49:00,490
Then who was it there?

815
01:50:48,730 --> 01:50:53,830
Believe me, there's nobody
except you in my heart.

816
01:50:57,740 --> 01:51:03,950
I always treated him as my friend.
But he took my friendship wrongly.

817
01:51:06,260 --> 01:51:08,570
I wanted to tell you about it
that day.

818
01:51:10,190 --> 01:51:11,640
Why didn't you listen then?

819
01:51:18,160 --> 01:51:22,860
Then I got scared. That's why
I continued to hide it from you...

820
01:51:24,630 --> 01:51:30,330
so you wouldn't misunderstand
me and I lose your love.

821
01:51:32,510 --> 01:51:34,490
I am living on the strength
of your love.

822
01:51:35,710 --> 01:51:38,660
I don't love anybody
except for you.

823
01:52:10,150 --> 01:52:11,650
I know that you're naive.

824
01:52:12,290 --> 01:52:18,760
You can never have a bad feeling.
But meeting a stranger so freely...

825
01:52:19,180 --> 01:52:22,360
can surely give a wrong impression
to him and the society.

826
01:52:22,970 --> 01:52:28,850
Forgive me, Daddy. I didn't
listen to you that day.

827
01:52:31,070 --> 01:52:34,910
I thought if my heart was clear,
why should I bother about society?

828
01:52:37,490 --> 01:52:38,950
But I was mistaken.

829
01:52:41,670 --> 01:52:47,350
You know that I'm innocent.
But society calls me guilty.

830
01:52:49,650 --> 01:52:52,420
Even my Rajan thinks I'm guilty.

831
01:52:56,710 --> 01:52:59,120
I'll go and tell Dilip
that he should leave.

832
01:53:00,840 --> 01:53:02,250
He can't stay here now.

833
01:54:14,300 --> 01:54:22,300
'You saved my life. But one word from
you also poisoned it too'

834
01:54:25,360 --> 01:54:27,450
'My Rajan has started
to suspect me now'

835
01:54:29,540 --> 01:54:34,450
'You've obliged me many times.
Oblige me once more'

836
01:54:36,160 --> 01:54:38,080
'Go away from here for good'

837
01:54:39,770 --> 01:54:42,750
'You'll continue to receive
your share of the money'

838
01:55:11,760 --> 01:55:13,330
Where'd you go
so early in the morning?

839
01:55:14,710 --> 01:55:16,290
Where'd you go
so early in the morning?

840
01:55:17,610 --> 01:55:19,540
You didn't have tea or breakfast.

841
01:55:20,750 --> 01:55:22,390
I was waiting for you.

842
01:55:23,160 --> 01:55:25,190
I thought of having tea
in some hotel today.

843
01:55:27,420 --> 01:55:28,790
What's wrong with it?

844
01:55:28,850 --> 01:55:34,100
You went without wearing the tie
properly, or putting a flower.

845
01:55:35,720 --> 01:55:37,030
Put it now.

846
01:55:56,860 --> 01:55:58,460
It doesn't have any fragrance
any longer.

847
01:56:01,520 --> 01:56:05,530
Come, dear. Come to your father!

848
01:56:10,210 --> 01:56:11,400
Come on, dear.

849
01:56:17,650 --> 01:56:20,146
Why do you play with this?
It's not good. It's very bad.

850
01:56:20,170 --> 01:56:22,040
I'll get you another.
Let's throw it away.

851
01:56:25,560 --> 01:56:27,020
Why do you weep?

852
01:56:28,010 --> 01:56:29,430
You too like it?

853
01:56:30,150 --> 01:56:32,550
There's no accounting for taste

854
01:56:32,740 --> 01:56:36,090
Don't worry. You may have it.

855
01:56:43,420 --> 01:56:46,180
Bye bye.

856
01:56:47,960 --> 01:56:49,050
Listen.

857
01:56:50,050 --> 01:56:51,180
Me?

858
01:56:54,300 --> 01:56:55,360
Yes?

859
01:57:00,450 --> 01:57:04,920
Do you really think there's
no fragrance in it now?

860
01:57:14,010 --> 01:57:17,590
The thing is,
I'm suffering from a cold.

861
01:57:27,190 --> 01:57:28,270
Listen...

862
01:57:28,640 --> 01:57:31,530
We've to attend Sheela's party
this evening. At what time?

863
01:57:32,460 --> 01:57:34,310
- 5 o'clock.
- At 5 o'clock?

864
01:57:35,800 --> 01:57:37,800
Please don't mind it.
I'm on my way to meet mother.

865
01:57:37,960 --> 01:57:40,036
From there, I'll be going
to play tennis at 5 o'clock.

866
01:57:40,060 --> 01:57:43,610
You may attend the
party along with Dilip.

867
01:57:49,600 --> 01:57:54,820
A child too has been born.
But her style remains unchanged.

868
01:57:55,730 --> 01:57:57,940
For how long can a husband
continue to bear with it?

869
01:57:58,320 --> 01:58:00,520
It would've been different
if there were a lover.

870
01:58:06,640 --> 01:58:08,070
I want to tell you something.

871
01:58:08,440 --> 01:58:09,690
Tell me?

872
01:58:12,870 --> 01:58:14,100
Go ahead.

873
01:58:22,970 --> 01:58:25,640
What're you thinking about?
Speak up.

874
01:58:40,800 --> 01:58:42,930
This flower suits only you.

875
01:58:43,680 --> 01:58:45,350
You're being formal.

876
01:58:46,830 --> 01:58:52,690
It's more suited to you.

877
01:58:55,490 --> 01:58:59,850
It's not my decoration.
Rather, you are seeing it wrongly.

878
01:59:03,700 --> 01:59:05,520
I'm leaving here today.

879
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,830
Before leaving, I wanted to clear
the misunderstanding.

880
01:59:11,830 --> 01:59:14,530
Once a priest offers a flower
to his deity...

881
01:59:15,780 --> 01:59:17,730
he can never offer it
again to anybody else.

882
01:59:17,850 --> 01:59:19,730
Forget it. Such things
have no meaning any more.

883
01:59:25,940 --> 01:59:27,440
Moreover, where's the priest?

884
01:59:37,570 --> 01:59:41,150
Keep bearing the atrocities
of his unfeeling attitude...

885
01:59:42,100 --> 01:59:45,910
and continue your existance

886
01:59:46,150 --> 01:59:54,150
Continue smiling, as you always do,
swallowing your tears

887
02:00:20,120 --> 02:00:28,120
This is the dictum of love, oh heart

888
02:00:37,170 --> 02:00:45,170
He gives you the anguish of suffering,
while you pray for him to be blessed

889
02:00:54,240 --> 02:00:59,740
That one glance of his which has
made a home in your heart...

890
02:01:16,720 --> 02:01:24,720
sustain yourself on that
single glance of his

891
02:01:42,470 --> 02:01:50,470
Even if society troubles you
or the world punishes you...

892
02:02:10,780 --> 02:02:15,990
you go on longing for him

893
02:02:27,930 --> 02:02:31,390
Keep bearing the atrocities
of his unfeeling attitude...

894
02:02:32,300 --> 02:02:36,280
and continue your existance

895
02:02:36,440 --> 02:02:44,440
Continue smiling, as you always do,
swallowing your tears

896
02:02:52,170 --> 02:02:53,960
You're still standing here?

897
02:02:54,220 --> 02:02:55,540
You didn't leave?

898
02:02:58,270 --> 02:03:02,310
You were listening to your send-off
song? You didn't get the permission?

899
02:03:05,550 --> 02:03:09,490
Just think. How could she
give you the permission?

900
02:03:09,730 --> 02:03:13,440
After all, who would handle
such a big business?

901
02:03:18,030 --> 02:03:21,280
Life's intricacies can never be
solved with a poisonous temperament.

902
02:03:22,950 --> 02:03:24,500
I too have a lot to say.

903
02:03:25,380 --> 02:03:26,916
But only truthfulness and
straightforwardness...

904
02:03:26,940 --> 02:03:28,650
can solve the misunderstandings.

905
02:03:31,050 --> 02:03:33,520
I regret that you couldn't
understand your wife even till now.

906
02:03:35,210 --> 02:03:38,210
I know. You understand my wife
better than I, right?

907
02:03:38,320 --> 02:03:41,650
I do. That's what I have
come to explain to you.

908
02:03:42,500 --> 02:03:46,030
I see. Tell this nonsense
just to her.

909
02:03:46,670 --> 02:03:48,500
I'm no longer interested
in your pretensions.

910
02:03:50,760 --> 02:03:52,540
Don't take advantage of her love.

911
02:03:53,880 --> 02:03:55,516
The whole world is willing to
bow down to her.

912
02:03:55,540 --> 02:03:59,090
Still, she made you her God.
After having acquired her...

913
02:03:59,140 --> 02:04:01,300
you began thinking of
yourself not as a human, but God.

914
02:04:01,360 --> 02:04:04,800
But don't you forget that the one
who has made you a God...

915
02:04:04,880 --> 02:04:06,596
is the same pure Goddess,
whose devotion you think is an act.

916
02:04:06,620 --> 02:04:07,980
You are unfit for her!

917
02:04:35,820 --> 02:04:37,360
Save him, doctor.

918
02:04:40,160 --> 02:04:41,740
He shouldn't die.

919
02:04:44,800 --> 02:04:50,450
Take my life.
But snatch him away from death.

920
02:04:53,390 --> 02:04:55,690
My life depends on him.

921
02:04:56,130 --> 02:04:57,850
I can't say anything for sure
at this stage.

922
02:04:58,920 --> 02:05:00,590
It's possible that
he might survive.

923
02:05:23,820 --> 02:05:25,090
Is he dead?

924
02:05:25,130 --> 02:05:26,430
No, he cannot die.

925
02:05:29,100 --> 02:05:33,170
If he dies, how will I ever
be able to face Rajan?

926
02:05:35,310 --> 02:05:37,090
He's the proof of my innocence.

927
02:05:38,400 --> 02:05:39,520
No!

928
02:05:40,300 --> 02:05:41,580
He cannot die!

929
02:05:43,270 --> 02:05:49,940
You cannot die, Dilip!

930
02:05:59,900 --> 02:06:06,700
You cannot die, Dilip.

931
02:06:09,650 --> 02:06:11,400
Who says that I've died?

932
02:06:13,730 --> 02:06:15,160
Who says I've died?

933
02:06:16,770 --> 02:06:18,130
I can never die.

934
02:06:22,180 --> 02:06:23,480
Where is he?

935
02:06:24,420 --> 02:06:25,690
Where is he?

936
02:06:30,510 --> 02:06:35,350
Where is he?

937
02:06:35,900 --> 02:06:38,440
Move away! He has gone crazy!

938
02:06:39,800 --> 02:06:40,930
Leave me.

939
02:06:40,980 --> 02:06:43,120
What're you doing?
No, dear.

940
02:06:43,490 --> 02:06:45,356
- He's hell bent on killing somebody.
- Leave me, doctor.

941
02:06:45,380 --> 02:06:48,250
- He might kill somebody.
- I am not scared of death.

942
02:07:13,320 --> 02:07:18,670
Don't worry, Neena.
He will recover.

943
02:07:20,300 --> 02:07:22,470
But he should be moved away
from here immediately.

944
02:07:24,060 --> 02:07:26,910
It's very dangerous for
him to continue living here.

945
02:07:28,480 --> 02:07:32,210
Doctor, she hasn't eaten anything
since last night.

946
02:07:33,160 --> 02:07:35,060
Please explain to her
and make her eat.

947
02:07:36,130 --> 02:07:37,330
Come on, dear.

948
02:07:52,300 --> 02:07:56,460
- Have you fed milk to the baby?
- Yes. Please eat the meals.

949
02:07:59,560 --> 02:08:00,840
What's the matter?

950
02:08:01,670 --> 02:08:03,760
- You're hiding something.
- Nothing.

951
02:08:07,760 --> 02:08:12,710
Where's baby?
Bring the baby to me.

952
02:08:13,740 --> 02:08:16,080
Master has taken baby away.

953
02:08:29,880 --> 02:08:31,900
Welcome, welcome.

954
02:08:32,420 --> 02:08:34,790
Tell me, how did you
take the trouble?

955
02:08:35,140 --> 02:08:41,900
Baby, do you recognize her?
No? She's your Mummy!

956
02:08:44,670 --> 02:08:46,960
How's your sick person?

957
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:51,160
I'm such an uncivilized person.
Why did I have to hit him?

958
02:08:51,630 --> 02:08:57,070
Come on. Sit in the car.
I'll come and ask for a pardon.

959
02:08:58,880 --> 02:09:02,460
Have you finished? Or do you still
have to shoot any more arrows?

960
02:09:03,240 --> 02:09:06,090
If I knew how to shoot arrows,
why would I have been hurt?

961
02:09:07,640 --> 02:09:13,700
You can cut open my heart
and see whose picture is inside.

962
02:09:14,200 --> 02:09:17,580
The picture is right in front of me.
I don't know how to murder a heart.

963
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:21,970
There's a limit to tolerance.
What exactly do you want?

964
02:09:23,130 --> 02:09:26,780
What I want doesn't matter.
You tell me what you want.

965
02:09:27,130 --> 02:09:28,780
Speak up.

966
02:09:29,750 --> 02:09:32,780
You want to rid yourself of me?
All right. I'm moving away.

967
02:09:32,930 --> 02:09:34,690
You may do whatever you please.
You are free.

968
02:09:35,540 --> 02:09:40,050
You're wealthy. You're beautiful.
You've a heart which loves.

969
02:09:40,270 --> 02:09:42,700
So what if a Rajan is not there?

970
02:09:45,610 --> 02:09:47,270
Rajan means everything to me.

971
02:09:49,410 --> 02:09:51,540
A world devoid of Rajan
is like hell for me.

972
02:09:51,830 --> 02:09:57,200
We won't go back to that hell now.
What say, Baby? Let's go away. Bye.

973
02:09:57,780 --> 02:10:01,660
Bye bye.

974
02:10:04,370 --> 02:10:05,760
You are so ruthless.

975
02:10:08,130 --> 02:10:10,250
Though you are a God to me,
still you don't pardon me?

976
02:10:10,730 --> 02:10:12,880
Even God won't pardon you.

977
02:10:13,160 --> 02:10:16,650
Aren't you satisfied even after
bringing a bad name to the family?

978
02:10:17,110 --> 02:10:18,730
You had snatched away
my son from me!

979
02:10:19,360 --> 02:10:21,210
You too have snatched
my child away from me.

980
02:10:21,740 --> 02:10:27,790
You don't deserve to be called
her mother. Go away from here!

981
02:10:29,150 --> 02:10:34,010
Before she is old enough to realise
that you are her mother...

982
02:10:34,410 --> 02:10:36,040
you should go and strangle yourself.

983
02:10:36,390 --> 02:10:38,860
Shameless girl!
Get out of here!

984
02:15:20,520 --> 02:15:22,390
I thought my Rajan has come.

985
02:15:23,360 --> 02:15:24,610
Where is he?

986
02:15:25,240 --> 02:15:33,240
He has ruined me by taking support
of this enchanting face.

987
02:15:40,480 --> 02:15:43,220
He has struck me with lightning
through these pink lips...

988
02:15:43,290 --> 02:15:44,820
to eliminate my desires.

989
02:15:47,460 --> 02:15:49,910
Before eliminating
that dacoit...

990
02:15:51,900 --> 02:15:57,200
I'll extinguish this fire for good...

991
02:15:58,580 --> 02:16:00,110
which has caused me heartburn.

992
02:16:02,410 --> 02:16:05,550
This will be your last
and biggest obligation.

993
02:16:07,650 --> 02:16:10,320
The hands which gave me
a new lease on life...

994
02:16:12,410 --> 02:16:15,750
those same hands should bring
an end to my miserable life.

995
02:16:18,870 --> 02:16:21,860
Perhaps my death might clear me
of my innocent crimes.

996
02:16:26,430 --> 02:16:28,500
Alas! Only if my Rajan too
could hear that...

997
02:16:30,610 --> 02:16:34,030
at the time of death too,
Neena took Rajan's name.

998
02:16:34,430 --> 02:16:36,870
That ungrateful fellow won't know
how the glow of the lamp is.

999
02:16:37,559 --> 02:16:39,029
He ran away fearing being burned.

1000
02:16:42,459 --> 02:16:43,779
This beautiful look...

1001
02:16:46,340 --> 02:16:47,760
these intoxicating eyes...

1002
02:16:49,730 --> 02:16:51,630
these burning flames...

1003
02:16:52,209 --> 02:16:56,379
I'm not going away to be scared
by it and run away.

1004
02:16:59,870 --> 02:17:03,570
You, you are mine!

1005
02:17:03,740 --> 02:17:05,830
- Leave me.
- Nobody can take you away from me.

1006
02:17:07,900 --> 02:17:09,240
- Leave me.
- You're mine!

1007
02:17:09,510 --> 02:17:11,090
Nobody can separate you from me.

1008
02:17:18,230 --> 02:17:22,280
You've fallen to such an extent
that you've lost your decency too.

1009
02:17:23,330 --> 02:17:24,700
You aren't even human anymore.

1010
02:17:24,730 --> 02:17:30,190
The heart which was proud of your
friendship, now hates you.

1011
02:17:31,200 --> 02:17:35,260
You know that I'm a married woman.
My respect is Rajan's respect.

1012
02:17:35,770 --> 02:17:37,540
And I will protect it till my death.

1013
02:17:38,160 --> 02:17:40,720
Even if I have to shoot dead
the one who obliged me.

1014
02:17:41,360 --> 02:17:42,550
Shoot me dead.

1015
02:17:44,110 --> 02:17:46,070
Shoot me dead if you can
bear to see me suffering.

1016
02:17:48,610 --> 02:17:49,850
Shoot me dead.

1017
02:17:52,930 --> 02:17:54,570
You cannot kill me.

1018
02:17:56,650 --> 02:18:00,710
Why is your hand shaking?
Why is your heart beating rapidly?

1019
02:18:01,500 --> 02:18:03,290
That's because you love me.

1020
02:18:03,610 --> 02:18:06,740
- I don't love anybody except Rajan.
- Ask your heart.

1021
02:18:07,219 --> 02:18:08,596
There's nobody except
Rajan in my heart.

1022
02:18:08,620 --> 02:18:09,890
You're lying.

1023
02:18:10,969 --> 02:18:12,419
You love me.

1024
02:18:14,320 --> 02:18:15,770
You love me.

1025
02:18:47,440 --> 02:18:49,300
Were you in love with Dilip?

1026
02:18:50,930 --> 02:18:52,760
Were you in love with Dilip or not?

1027
02:18:53,559 --> 02:18:55,959
Did Neena ever express to you
about Dilip's love?

1028
02:18:57,680 --> 02:19:02,500
- Did Neena love Dilip or not?
- Neena loves only Rajan.

1029
02:19:09,420 --> 02:19:11,010
Do you recognise this woman?

1030
02:19:15,820 --> 02:19:18,610
Do you recognise this woman?

1031
02:19:21,400 --> 02:19:23,190
You don't recognise your wife?

1032
02:19:25,650 --> 02:19:27,136
If I did recognise her...

1033
02:19:27,160 --> 02:19:29,180
why did I have to come here
to identify her?

1034
02:19:32,459 --> 02:19:36,349
On the one hand, she called me God
and offered me flowers of love.

1035
02:19:37,950 --> 02:19:40,435
On the other hand, she made the
innocent Dilip crazy about her...

1036
02:19:40,459 --> 02:19:45,739
by parties, clubs, ballrooms,
clubs and every Western style.

1037
02:19:46,490 --> 02:19:49,220
What proof do you have that
Neena loves Dilip...

1038
02:19:49,650 --> 02:19:51,490
on the basis of which
you rejected her?

1039
02:19:52,830 --> 02:19:57,110
Is this not adequate proof that
before I came...

1040
02:19:57,190 --> 02:20:03,340
she never told Dilip that
Rajan too was a part of her life.

1041
02:20:05,630 --> 02:20:07,720
She used to enchant me
by calling me God.

1042
02:20:08,390 --> 02:20:10,096
Before our marriage, she trapped
Dilip in her clutches...

1043
02:20:10,120 --> 02:20:13,170
by giving him half her
property and business...

1044
02:20:14,960 --> 02:20:16,760
so that he is never able
to separate from her.

1045
02:20:18,280 --> 02:20:22,720
And after marriage, after having
separated from him...

1046
02:20:22,770 --> 02:20:24,890
she couldn't sleep peacefully
even for a single night.

1047
02:20:25,670 --> 02:20:27,110
And because of her love for him...

1048
02:20:27,140 --> 02:20:29,020
she didn't even let her
friend Sheela marry him.

1049
02:20:32,550 --> 02:20:35,670
When I asked her why Dilip
doesn't marry Sheela...

1050
02:20:37,500 --> 02:20:43,980
she said that he doesn't love her.
Then whom does he love?

1051
02:20:47,460 --> 02:20:48,780
There was no reply.

1052
02:20:50,500 --> 02:20:52,700
Then she got upset and said
that I've insulted her love.

1053
02:20:54,780 --> 02:20:59,600
And Rajan,
blinded by his love for her...

1054
02:20:59,630 --> 02:21:02,380
considered her every lie
to be the truth.

1055
02:21:04,060 --> 02:21:07,600
And against her wishes, when I brought
her back from Simla...

1056
02:21:08,530 --> 02:21:10,420
in the darkness,
she thought I was Dilip...

1057
02:21:10,870 --> 02:21:13,150
and confessed her love to me.

1058
02:21:13,450 --> 02:21:18,210
Blinded by love, you looked every
aspect about Neena with suspicion.

1059
02:21:18,750 --> 02:21:23,000
If she loved Dilip,
how could she murder him?

1060
02:21:24,750 --> 02:21:27,290
She has murdered him
just to cheat me.

1061
02:21:28,550 --> 02:21:31,760
She has murdered Dilip only to
falsely convince society that...

1062
02:21:32,680 --> 02:21:34,270
she is a devoted wife.

1063
02:21:34,650 --> 02:21:37,220
She kept her husband alive...

1064
02:21:37,800 --> 02:21:40,400
only because he could protect
her from being lambasted by society.

1065
02:21:40,820 --> 02:21:42,736
In the eyes of the court,
she is guilty of killing Dilip.

1066
02:21:42,760 --> 02:21:46,690
But I assure you, she is guilty
of killing two innocent people.

1067
02:21:47,620 --> 02:21:50,160
She killed one and brought
him peace for good...

1068
02:21:50,530 --> 02:21:53,420
and she made another person's
life a living hell.

1069
02:21:54,380 --> 02:21:56,920
She's the living example of
your modern society...

1070
02:21:57,500 --> 02:22:04,030
who calls her lover a friend
only to comfort her husband.

1071
02:22:07,430 --> 02:22:10,060
I had a lot to defend myself.

1072
02:22:12,200 --> 02:22:15,290
But after Rajan's testimony,
I don't want to say anything.

1073
02:22:17,580 --> 02:22:19,880
I am a culprit in the
eyes of society...

1074
02:22:21,390 --> 02:22:23,950
because I never cared
for the society.

1075
02:22:26,940 --> 02:22:29,240
And I never listened to my Daddy.

1076
02:22:32,710 --> 02:22:35,110
If I had listened to him
that day...

1077
02:22:36,850 --> 02:22:38,670
I wouldn't have had
to see such a day.

1078
02:22:42,180 --> 02:22:43,790
I should be punished.

1079
02:22:45,480 --> 02:22:50,590
Dilip was my friend.
I have murdered him.

1080
02:23:04,890 --> 02:23:07,100
You can weep, but I can't.

1081
02:23:09,630 --> 02:23:11,650
Your Mummy's destiny
will be determined today.

1082
02:23:13,390 --> 02:23:14,900
Perhaps she might be released.

1083
02:23:16,300 --> 02:23:18,860
But she has doomed us
to suffer all our lives.

1084
02:23:21,220 --> 02:23:23,230
Where should I bring
your Mummy now?

1085
02:23:24,170 --> 02:23:28,140
Your Mummy didn't belong to us.
She didn't belong to us.

1086
02:23:32,030 --> 02:23:33,790
This has snatched your
Mummy from us.

1087
02:23:35,600 --> 02:23:37,380
Why do you keep it
so close to your heart?

1088
02:23:38,220 --> 02:23:39,610
Throw it away.

1089
02:23:40,170 --> 02:23:44,160
He has snatched your
Mummy from us.

1090
02:23:53,800 --> 02:23:55,140
'I have loved you'

1091
02:23:56,170 --> 02:23:58,940
'A kind of love which if lovers
had known would give examples of'

1092
02:24:00,350 --> 02:24:02,500
'By ruining my world,
I have learned that...

1093
02:24:03,580 --> 02:24:08,870
'an Indian woman loves only
once and only one person'

1094
02:24:10,130 --> 02:24:13,380
'And that fortunate person
is your Rajan'

1095
02:24:18,770 --> 02:24:25,940
The jury has unanimously decided
that under Section 302...

1096
02:24:26,710 --> 02:24:28,370
you should be hanged to death.

1097
02:24:29,190 --> 02:24:32,240
At the same time, they have even
pleaded mercy for you.

1098
02:24:32,820 --> 02:24:34,330
Therefore...

1099
02:24:35,280 --> 02:24:37,760
I sentence you to be deported
to Kala Pani for penal servitude.

1100
02:25:02,900 --> 02:25:04,810
My heart said that
you will surely come.

1101
02:25:07,900 --> 02:25:09,300
You weren't at fault.

1102
02:25:11,950 --> 02:25:16,790
Anybody else in your place would've
felt suspicious like you did.

1103
02:25:20,050 --> 02:25:21,370
I was at fault.

1104
02:25:23,130 --> 02:25:25,530
So was the society which
I had been a part of.

1105
02:25:28,460 --> 02:25:30,020
I am suffering because of that.

1106
02:25:33,830 --> 02:25:35,460
I just want from you that...

1107
02:25:37,830 --> 02:25:40,150
you should keep our daughter
away from such an atmosphere.

1108
02:25:43,500 --> 02:25:49,600
The foreign soil and atmosphere can
never be suitable for our children.

1109
02:26:30,880 --> 02:26:32,460
Whether you believe me or not...

1110
02:26:34,460 --> 02:26:35,840
You are still my God.
