00:04:55,567 --> 00:04:57,558
Porter, pick up the luggage

4
00:05:31,127 --> 00:05:34,881
- Do you know Mr Mehta's house?
- If you don't mind, I'll escort you

5
00:05:37,967 --> 00:05:42,199
- You seem to be a gentleman?
- Right. I'm educated too

6
00:05:43,047 --> 00:05:47,199
- Aren't you ashamed to accost a lady?
- I haven't quite begun, have I?

7
00:05:47,527 --> 00:05:51,884
- Don't you assume that I'm alone.
- Are you? Here I am with you

8
00:05:52,567 --> 00:05:55,877
- Who do you think you are?
- Raju

9
00:05:57,967 --> 00:05:59,878
Rajkumar Mehta

10
00:06:00,967 --> 00:06:02,878
- Raju!
- Pushpa?

11
00:06:09,007 --> 00:06:10,998
- You never wrote to me from England.
- I did

12
00:06:11,527 --> 00:06:17,875
- Yes. Once, 7 years ago. I was 12 then.
- Were I to write to you now...

13
00:06:18,047 --> 00:06:20,207
- would you reply?
- Certainly. And I'm here to see you

14
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:24,287
- Shobha hasn't come?
- Everyone's gone for an outing

15
00:06:26,407 --> 00:06:28,204
You mind my coming?

16
00:06:31,887 --> 00:06:33,878
All right, I don't mind

17
00:06:37,287 --> 00:06:40,279
- Managing the business, aren't you?
- No, no

18
00:06:40,407 --> 00:06:43,877
Why not? He sent you to England
for business studies

19
00:06:44,047 --> 00:06:47,198
Business was what I started out with ;
ended up learning music

20
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,886
- Music?
- Yes

21
00:06:49,047 --> 00:06:51,515
Music is just a fad. Not a livelihood,
can it be?

22
00:06:51,927 --> 00:06:53,883
You think so too?

23
00:06:58,207 --> 00:07:00,327
If it can happen out there,
it can happen out here too

24
00:07:01,407 --> 00:07:04,046
- And when will such a time come?
- It has to be brought about

25
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:12,878
- Dinu Kaka, look who's here!
- How did the two of you...

26
00:07:13,047 --> 00:07:14,878
- recognise each other?
- What's so difficult?

27
00:07:15,047 --> 00:07:21,316
- You only have to look.
- You were staring at me!

28
00:07:22,007 --> 00:07:25,886
That's what he was doing
even when he was a kid

29
00:07:26,007 --> 00:07:27,406
- Who me? Or she?
- You

30
00:07:27,567 --> 00:07:28,567
- You!
- You!

31
00:07:28,887 --> 00:07:31,355
I'll send tea over
while you fight it out

32
00:07:32,047 --> 00:07:34,356
- You!
- All right, I yield. Come on

33
00:07:34,527 --> 00:07:36,358
Please carry her luggage in

34
00:07:44,007 --> 00:07:47,363
- Where are the others?
- They've gone to Delhi

35
00:07:48,527 --> 00:07:51,883
Keep her luggage upstairs

36
00:07:54,967 --> 00:07:57,356
- Is tea ready?
- Coming up, sir

37
00:07:57,567 --> 00:08:02,880
- Make it fast. The lady must be tired.
- One thing is really tiring me out

38
00:08:03,407 --> 00:08:09,198
- Really? Now will you stop joking?
- Let go! You're killing me!

39
00:08:09,527 --> 00:08:11,358
Your father is here!

40
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:15,918
- No one!
- Liar! How dare...?

41
00:08:16,167 --> 00:08:17,361
Don't touch me!

42
00:08:19,327 --> 00:08:22,205
All right, sit down Sit

43
00:08:23,407 --> 00:08:25,204
Come on, sit

44
00:08:27,527 --> 00:08:29,518
Okay! I'll back off

45
00:08:31,567 --> 00:08:33,364
I'm not a kid anymore

46
00:08:36,327 --> 00:08:38,204
That I can see

47
00:08:43,006 --> 00:08:44,884
You look so pretty

48
00:08:47,207 --> 00:08:50,040
And I haven't yet freshened up
after the journey

49
00:08:51,887 --> 00:08:53,878
What? You think I'm serious?

50
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,918
I remember the days
when we were young

51
00:09:16,207 --> 00:09:22,203
Remember playing family?
You would go to work

52
00:09:23,407 --> 00:09:27,878
- And you'd cook for me.
- What wages would you bring home?

53
00:09:28,327 --> 00:09:31,876
- Fake coins!
- Your cooking was play-acting too

54
00:09:35,327 --> 00:09:38,876
I've never felt as rich as
I was with those fake coins

55
00:09:39,407 --> 00:09:42,205
Nor have I ever had
such filling meals

56
00:09:44,047 --> 00:09:48,199
And one day, you went out
and you never came back

57
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:51,524
Or was it you who left
for your in-laws?

58
00:09:52,567 --> 00:09:55,365
- In-laws?
- Yes

59
00:09:56,207 --> 00:09:58,516
- Say that again.
- Your in-laws

60
00:10:05,407 --> 00:10:08,205
You look pretty when you're angry

61
00:10:09,887 --> 00:10:11,878
- You liar!
- I swear

62
00:10:13,407 --> 00:10:15,363
Let me freshen up first

63
00:10:56,327 --> 00:10:58,887
"I miss..."

64
00:10:59,287 --> 00:11:02,996
"Those intoxicating eyes"

65
00:11:03,607 --> 00:11:04,607
"Friends..."

66
00:11:04,967 --> 00:11:06,446
"Please..."

67
00:11:06,887 --> 00:11:08,445
"Hold..."

68
00:11:08,887 --> 00:11:11,003
"My hands"

69
00:11:24,407 --> 00:11:25,886
Pushpa! It's you!

70
00:11:29,007 --> 00:11:31,202
- All of a sudden?
- I cabled. Raju received me

71
00:11:31,407 --> 00:11:36,356
- I picked her up from the station.
- You're seeing her after so long

72
00:11:36,527 --> 00:11:39,200
- What would she think?
- Not in front of guests

73
00:11:39,887 --> 00:11:41,878
Pushpa is like my daughter.
How is your father?

74
00:11:42,047 --> 00:11:44,038
- Fine.
- Why didn't they come?

75
00:11:44,407 --> 00:11:46,875
They'll come later.
Mummy isn't keeping well

76
00:11:47,007 --> 00:11:51,364
- Oh, you're such a big girl!
- I don't like this music!

77
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:55,885
- Is it a crime?
- Don't you talk back

78
00:11:56,047 --> 00:11:59,039
- Let him be.
- You've spoilt him

79
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:06,884
This prestige, this wealth that you
enjoy, do you know how I made all this?

80
00:12:08,047 --> 00:12:12,359
By dint of my own guts, my toil.
And I send you to England...

81
00:12:13,327 --> 00:12:17,878
so you'd manage my businesses,
so I can hold my head high...

82
00:12:18,527 --> 00:12:20,518
when I tell people,
this is my son

83
00:12:20,887 --> 00:12:24,880
- What've I done to bring you to shame?
- You ask what you've done?

84
00:12:25,527 --> 00:12:29,884
- You go around singing like a vagabond!
- You think music is for vagabonds?

85
00:12:30,607 --> 00:12:34,885
- Not only I, the whole world thinks so!
- 15 years ago...

86
00:12:35,887 --> 00:12:38,063
the whole world thought that
a contractor was no good either

87
00:12:38,087 --> 00:12:40,203
- What drivel!
- Grandpa used to say that too

88
00:12:40,567 --> 00:12:43,206
- But I've proved myself!
- I'll prove myself too

89
00:12:44,127 --> 00:12:49,360
- You think it will bring us honour?
- No work is bad

90
00:12:49,927 --> 00:12:52,361
You will do what I want

91
00:12:55,647 --> 00:12:59,196
- How long has this been going on?
- Ever since Raju has returned

92
00:13:00,007 --> 00:13:02,362
He's adamant. So is Daddy

93
00:13:04,327 --> 00:13:07,876
It's the blood. Why don't you
make them see reason?

94
00:13:08,567 --> 00:13:15,882
Daddy? Had he seen reason,
would I still be here?

95
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:22,883
- Only time will make him realise.
- Time?

96
00:13:24,447 --> 00:13:27,200
It has to be brought about

97
00:13:58,887 --> 00:14:01,879
A fifth cup? For whom?
Raju isn't coming

98
00:14:02,207 --> 00:14:05,040
- Why?
- He won't come

99
00:14:08,087 --> 00:14:09,884
I'll bring him over

100
00:14:54,567 --> 00:14:56,876
- Won't you laugh?
- When did I cry?

101
00:14:58,007 --> 00:15:01,363
- Are you cross?
- Not with you?

102
00:15:02,127 --> 00:15:05,199
With your father? You're cross
with him, he's cross with you

103
00:15:05,527 --> 00:15:07,882
At this rate, it'll go
from bad to worse

104
00:15:08,327 --> 00:15:10,887
- How am I to blame?
- But you must try to solve it

105
00:15:11,047 --> 00:15:16,041
- You must change your attitude.
- You'd rather tell him, not me

106
00:15:17,087 --> 00:15:19,043
Had I not known him,
would I ask you to?

107
00:15:19,967 --> 00:15:24,882
This everyday feud over small things
will make things worse

108
00:15:26,567 --> 00:15:30,355
- What do you mean to say?
- There are squabbles in every family

109
00:15:30,927 --> 00:15:36,877
- But a compromise isn't beneath dignity.
- Compromise? No question of compromise

110
00:15:37,047 --> 00:15:40,357
- between people who are poles apart.
- One always defers to his elders

111
00:15:40,927 --> 00:15:45,205
- It has to be brought about. Your words.
- I still say that

112
00:15:45,647 --> 00:15:50,357
What's the point? Do something.
When you were away...

113
00:15:51,127 --> 00:15:54,881
I used to wonder how you'd turn up.

114
00:15:56,087 --> 00:15:59,045
Can't you bring it to fruition?

115
00:16:02,527 --> 00:16:07,885
- That's what the quarrel is about.
- Success takes big sacrifices

116
00:16:08,207 --> 00:16:11,882
- One has to give up what one loves most.
- For music, I can do anything!

117
00:16:13,287 --> 00:16:18,202
- But in this house, I can't do a thing!
- There's Bombay, there's Calcutta

118
00:16:18,367 --> 00:16:21,882
- There are music companies over there.
- You're right, Pushpa!

119
00:16:22,887 --> 00:16:28,359
No Raju, I'm not telling you to leave.
I was just giving an example

120
00:16:28,527 --> 00:16:30,199
I'm going to Bombay!

121
00:16:33,407 --> 00:16:38,879
Is this why I'm here? So that you'd go
away to Bombay as soon as I came here?

122
00:16:39,967 --> 00:16:41,878
You've shown me the way, Pushpa!

123
00:16:48,327 --> 00:16:52,878
In the bargain, I've lost mine

124
00:16:55,527 --> 00:16:58,883
And why did I get here
before my parents?

125
00:17:00,207 --> 00:17:03,882
I thought we'd talk a lot, we'd go out,
we'd enjoy ourselves

126
00:17:07,047 --> 00:17:13,361
- You can go out with Shobha.
- Is that why I'm here?

127
00:17:14,926 --> 00:17:17,360
All right, we're going out after tea

128
00:17:19,646 --> 00:17:22,365
No? No...?

129
00:17:24,567 --> 00:17:27,877
- What happened?
- I came to ask you over for tea!

130
00:18:23,407 --> 00:18:27,195
"My heart is crazy,
it won't listen to excuses"

131
00:18:27,527 --> 00:18:29,358
"Please stay back"

132
00:18:29,927 --> 00:18:34,876
"Don't give in to your heart,
it is just crazy"

133
00:19:05,207 --> 00:19:09,883
"Desires are something
the heart cannot control"

134
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:13,199
"Turn back, embrace me"

135
00:19:13,607 --> 00:19:18,203
"Let not your heart play
the music loud"

136
00:19:18,567 --> 00:19:21,877
"Someone might listen,
O crazy one"

137
00:19:22,007 --> 00:19:26,364
"Desires are something
the heart cannot control"

138
00:19:27,087 --> 00:19:30,363
"Someone might listen,
O crazy one"

139
00:19:30,527 --> 00:19:33,883
"It hardly matters to anyone"

140
00:19:34,887 --> 00:19:37,879
"My love, give in to me"

141
00:19:38,007 --> 00:19:39,884
- "Quiet!
- You be quiet"

142
00:20:13,967 --> 00:20:18,358
"I'm afraid, this may kick up
a storm"

143
00:20:19,007 --> 00:20:21,885
"Should I tell everyone?
Or should I keep mum?"

144
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:25,882
"I'm a simpleton"

145
00:20:26,327 --> 00:20:29,364
"You decide, I can't say"

146
00:20:29,927 --> 00:20:34,364
"I'm afraid, this may kick up
a storm"

147
00:20:34,647 --> 00:20:37,878
"You decide, I can't say"

148
00:20:38,047 --> 00:20:41,881
"You are too smart"

149
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:45,200
"My love, give in..."

150
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:46,601
"Quiet
- You be quit.

151
00:20:46,927 --> 00:20:50,886
"My heart is crazy,
it won't listen to excuses"

152
00:20:51,247 --> 00:20:52,885
"Please stay back"

153
00:20:53,047 --> 00:20:58,360
"Don't give in to your heart,
it is just crazy"

154
00:21:31,007 --> 00:21:34,363
- Shobha has come to know everything.
- Good. We needn't tell her

155
00:21:34,887 --> 00:21:37,355
She was teasing me.
I shouldn't have gone out with you

156
00:21:37,527 --> 00:21:40,280
- Why did you?
- You think I'm here to meet you?

157
00:21:40,407 --> 00:21:46,198
- What else for?
- I won't be a subject for gossip

158
00:21:46,407 --> 00:21:49,877
- All for the better.
- What do you think of yourself?

159
00:21:50,647 --> 00:21:55,880
Wait till I've made a name
for myself in Bombay.

160
00:21:56,047 --> 00:21:57,878
You'll say proudly...

161
00:21:58,047 --> 00:22:01,357
I won't say a thing!
You just don't understand...

162
00:22:01,527 --> 00:22:04,280
- I don't understand?
- What I want you to understand

163
00:22:04,407 --> 00:22:06,363
- Then tell me!
- All in good time

164
00:22:06,887 --> 00:22:10,038
Pushpa, hurry up and bring Raju along.
Aren't you going to the party?

165
00:22:10,207 --> 00:22:12,327
I'm not bringing him along.
We aren't on talking terms

166
00:22:12,567 --> 00:22:15,206
- I'm not going to the party.
- I'm not going either!

167
00:22:16,087 --> 00:22:18,078
- Let them go.
- You expect me to say yes...

168
00:22:18,207 --> 00:22:20,357
- to everything you say?
- Look, I'm not going

169
00:22:20,927 --> 00:22:23,885
At the party, they're going to ask me
to sing. And Dad wears tough boots

170
00:22:24,087 --> 00:22:26,885
- I'd rather stay away from parties!
- Your Dad is right

171
00:22:27,047 --> 00:22:28,878
You deserve a kicking

172
00:22:35,047 --> 00:22:39,199
Raju, a bit of reasoning could help

173
00:23:49,967 --> 00:23:54,358
What's this? What the hell...?

174
00:24:32,287 --> 00:24:35,882
- Are you drunk?
- In ecstasy of being with you!

175
00:24:36,887 --> 00:24:39,196
Would it make a difference
if I weren't drunk already?

176
00:24:39,407 --> 00:24:41,363
Hush! You'll wake up everyone

177
00:24:43,647 --> 00:24:46,878
- Forget everyone.
- Why did you drink?

178
00:24:53,647 --> 00:24:57,037
Some drink because they're happy.
Some drink because they're sad

179
00:24:58,207 --> 00:25:00,880
Sad...? But I...

180
00:25:02,887 --> 00:25:06,357
You're cross with me.
So that's why...?

181
00:25:08,047 --> 00:25:09,878
But I...?

182
00:25:10,247 --> 00:25:18,247
You're a man. You can express whatever
you dislike. I'm a girl. I can't even...

183
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:23,878
- speak of what I like.
- Oh yes

184
00:25:27,207 --> 00:25:32,361
I'll tell you what, just tell me
what you want. I'll tell everyone!

185
00:25:36,887 --> 00:25:39,879
- Not everything can be spoken.
- Is it so special?

186
00:25:41,007 --> 00:25:44,522
But how am I to understand?
Oh yes...

187
00:25:45,407 --> 00:25:49,195
you promised you'd explain

188
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:51,884
When the time comes

189
00:25:52,407 --> 00:25:58,357
- What better a time than this?
- It's two in the night

190
00:26:00,527 --> 00:26:05,885
So? Here we are. You and I.

191
00:26:08,047 --> 00:26:09,878
Get up now

192
00:26:11,967 --> 00:26:13,878
First, you will explain

193
00:26:25,887 --> 00:26:27,878
You still don't understand?

194
00:26:32,527 --> 00:26:34,882
Just keep doing that.
I'll surely understand

195
00:26:42,207 --> 00:26:43,879
Aren't you hungry?

196
00:26:53,967 --> 00:26:57,880
- I kept your dinner in your room.
- How about feeding me?

197
00:27:31,047 --> 00:27:33,197
I'm drunk because I'm happy

198
00:27:56,887 --> 00:27:59,287
How come you haven't put my call
through yet? Is this a joke?

199
00:27:59,527 --> 00:28:02,360
Will you make good the money
I lose because of this call?

200
00:28:05,407 --> 00:28:06,886
Jerks

201
00:28:07,407 --> 00:28:10,046
- Why isn't Raju here yet?
- He's asleep

202
00:28:10,887 --> 00:28:16,359
- Why didn't you haul him out of bed?
- Why be angry with him all the time?

203
00:28:16,887 --> 00:28:19,879
Raju is now an adult.
You should at least consider that

204
00:28:20,087 --> 00:28:24,319
Do you mean to patronise me because
you were in my father's employ?

205
00:28:25,127 --> 00:28:29,882
You're a servant. Remember only that.
You will do as you're told. Go now

206
00:28:35,967 --> 00:28:37,036
Jerk

207
00:28:48,567 --> 00:28:51,877
- Why do you want Raju so early?
- In business there's lots to do!

208
00:28:52,407 --> 00:28:55,205
- What does he know of all that?
- That's why I want him to learn

209
00:28:55,527 --> 00:29:02,365
But you've spoiled him. Now he needs
a kicking. And I'll straighten him out

210
00:29:02,527 --> 00:29:06,520
- But you won't interfere.
- I'll stay mum, and I'll watch

211
00:29:07,127 --> 00:29:10,199
What happened to my daughter
is now happening to my son

212
00:29:10,927 --> 00:29:13,885
Just because you're adamant,
your daughter remains a spinster

213
00:29:14,287 --> 00:29:16,881
And now you're after your son

214
00:29:21,327 --> 00:29:24,876
Look, haste isn't always good

215
00:29:25,887 --> 00:29:28,526
And you didn't see
what I saw last night

216
00:29:29,887 --> 00:29:34,199
It's going to be love that will
turn him around. Don't you meddle

217
00:29:35,207 --> 00:29:37,038
I'll handle it out.

218
00:30:35,207 --> 00:30:36,879
No one seems to be here

219
00:30:39,567 --> 00:30:41,364
What more could we want?

220
00:30:50,087 --> 00:30:52,043
I don't want anything

221
00:31:00,367 --> 00:31:02,198
But I want

222
00:31:05,327 --> 00:31:08,876
You're lying. Don't you really want
something?

223
00:31:22,927 --> 00:31:27,876
"On the sly, when
thirsty souls meet..."

224
00:31:28,007 --> 00:31:29,201
"I..."

225
00:31:30,407 --> 00:31:32,363
"And you..."

226
00:31:33,007 --> 00:31:39,196
"Imagine what happens if the clouds
suddenly shower their kindness"

227
00:31:40,327 --> 00:31:41,885
"Rains"

228
00:31:43,127 --> 00:31:46,881
"On the sly, when
thirsty souls meet..."

229
00:31:47,007 --> 00:31:49,043
"I..."

230
00:31:49,287 --> 00:31:50,879
"You..."

231
00:31:51,327 --> 00:31:52,885
"And...?"

232
00:31:55,887 --> 00:32:01,883
"Imagine what happens if the clouds
suddenly shower their kindness"

233
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:07,884
"Rains"

234
00:32:36,887 --> 00:32:40,880
"My downcast eyes..."

235
00:32:41,007 --> 00:32:44,886
"Hide a thousand restive desires"

236
00:32:45,367 --> 00:32:48,882
"My breath, paused..."

237
00:32:49,607 --> 00:32:53,361
"Hold a thousand silent tempests"

238
00:32:53,887 --> 00:32:57,880
"My downcast eyes..."

239
00:32:58,047 --> 00:33:01,881
"Hide a thousand restive desires"

240
00:33:02,327 --> 00:33:05,876
"My breath, paused..."

241
00:33:06,407 --> 00:33:10,400
"Hold a thousand silent tempests"

242
00:33:10,647 --> 00:33:12,205
"Slowly?

243
00:33:12,367 --> 00:33:13,880
"Slowly"

244
00:33:18,927 --> 00:33:22,886
"On the sly, when
thirsty souls meet..."

245
00:33:23,047 --> 00:33:24,878
"I..."

246
00:33:25,087 --> 00:33:26,884
"And you"

247
00:33:46,087 --> 00:33:49,875
- "Is it the cool breeze...
- Rustling?"

248
00:33:50,327 --> 00:33:54,206
- "Or is it the music...
- Of love?"

249
00:33:54,567 --> 00:33:58,355
"Your looks"
- Melody"

250
00:33:58,927 --> 00:34:02,886
- "My heartbeats?
- Poetry"

251
00:34:03,167 --> 00:34:06,876
"Is it the cool breeze rustling?"

252
00:34:07,207 --> 00:34:11,200
"Or is it the music of love?"

253
00:34:11,527 --> 00:34:15,361
"Your looks, melody"

254
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:19,880
"my heartbeats, poetry"

255
00:34:20,087 --> 00:34:21,884
"Slowly?

256
00:34:22,087 --> 00:34:23,884
"Slowly"

257
00:34:28,407 --> 00:34:32,366
"On the sly, when
thirsty souls meet..."

258
00:34:32,527 --> 00:34:33,880
"I..."

259
00:34:34,887 --> 00:34:36,366
"You..."

260
00:34:37,127 --> 00:34:38,276
"And...?"

261
00:34:41,206 --> 00:34:46,883
"Imagine what happens if the clouds
suddenly shower their kindness"

262
00:34:47,527 --> 00:34:48,880
"Rains"

263
00:34:49,887 --> 00:34:51,878
- "When...
- I..."

264
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:53,998
- "When...
- And you...?"

265
00:35:33,087 --> 00:35:36,363
First there came music.
Now even a melodrama?

266
00:35:37,207 --> 00:35:40,882
You said Pushpa would take care
of him? He has taken care of Pushpa!

267
00:35:41,967 --> 00:35:46,040
This is what you wanted me to see,
and say nothing?

268
00:35:47,087 --> 00:35:49,043
What more is left to be seen?

269
00:35:51,007 --> 00:35:55,876
You've spoiled him rotten! You said
he'd mend his ways, didn't you?

270
00:35:56,327 --> 00:36:02,880
It's a kicking that'll mend him. Just
you watch what I do, and not a word!

271
00:36:16,287 --> 00:36:19,882
- Son, you should mend your ways.
- But what have I done, Mummy?

272
00:36:20,287 --> 00:36:24,360
- Give up music. Join the business.
- You're on his side too?

273
00:36:24,647 --> 00:36:29,198
What can I do? I try to reason with
you, I try to reason with him

274
00:36:29,367 --> 00:36:33,201
- I'm not getting into business!
- Not even for the show of it?

275
00:36:36,287 --> 00:36:41,884
You also heard what his father said.
Pushpa, take care of him

276
00:36:46,527 --> 00:36:50,361
- There he goes drinking again!
- No way! I won't let him drink

277
00:37:15,047 --> 00:37:18,881
- So they've put you on my tail?
- What do you mean?

278
00:37:19,287 --> 00:37:21,323
- Nothing.
- You suspect me?

279
00:37:21,607 --> 00:37:24,201
- I suspect no one.
- But you don't trust me!

280
00:37:24,327 --> 00:37:26,318
- I don't know.
- Then you don't trust me!

281
00:37:26,527 --> 00:37:28,279
When did I say that?

282
00:37:33,087 --> 00:37:36,363
You said nothing,
and you said it all.

283
00:37:37,527 --> 00:37:41,361
Have I said it all for nothing?

284
00:37:41,527 --> 00:37:44,519
Everyone expects me to understand,
and no one wants to understand me?

285
00:37:45,367 --> 00:37:50,202
- Why include me?
- I don't care! I have to get away!

286
00:37:50,927 --> 00:37:52,967
If you had to, why didn't you go away
before I came?

287
00:37:57,287 --> 00:38:01,200
Had I not chosen to wait for you,
I would've left long ago

288
00:38:03,887 --> 00:38:06,003
- If you care so much...
- I just can't decide!

289
00:38:41,407 --> 00:38:45,525
Now come off it. He's your father,
not just anyone else

290
00:38:46,047 --> 00:38:49,881
- Don't interfere, Pushpa.
- Raju, this is too much!

291
00:38:52,167 --> 00:38:56,877
- In the meantime... waiter...
- You need a cold drink to cool down

292
00:39:42,567 --> 00:39:44,205
Have it

293
00:39:50,247 --> 00:39:52,238
Nice view. Just take a look

294
00:40:00,647 --> 00:40:02,877
- I'm ecstatic!
- Already?

295
00:40:24,967 --> 00:40:28,880
- When did you come from Jalandhar?
- A few days ago. Meet...

296
00:40:44,327 --> 00:40:47,876
- Where are you putting up?
- With one of Daddy's friends

297
00:40:48,327 --> 00:40:51,319
- What's his name?
- Don't remember

298
00:40:52,607 --> 00:40:55,519
- Where do they live?
- Near Summer Inn

299
00:40:59,047 --> 00:41:01,038
- Address?
- I don't know

300
00:41:02,287 --> 00:41:04,198
Never mind. I'll find out

301
00:41:05,247 --> 00:41:09,877
- No! I'm a guest in his house.
- So what? I'll come to see you

302
00:41:14,207 --> 00:41:16,357
A present, from me

303
00:41:17,887 --> 00:41:20,355
- I don't accept presents.
- Start with now

304
00:41:27,527 --> 00:41:30,883
"The moon, you and I..."

305
00:41:34,567 --> 00:41:37,400
"I wish we could walk together"

306
00:42:08,887 --> 00:42:13,199
Lovely evening! The moon up there,
a beauty down here

307
00:42:17,327 --> 00:42:19,887
What happened? Did the policeman
spoil your mood?

308
00:42:20,967 --> 00:42:22,878
Handsome, isn't he?

309
00:42:26,527 --> 00:42:28,404
Don't you talk rubbish

310
00:42:33,647 --> 00:42:37,356
You have to settle down with someone
or the other. What's wrong with him?

311
00:42:37,887 --> 00:42:40,879
He makes a good enough living.
He isn't unemployed, like I am

312
00:42:41,327 --> 00:42:43,363
- Not again!
- Now don't be cross

313
00:42:44,207 --> 00:42:46,357
I'm the one who's telling you.
Not just anyone else

314
00:42:53,527 --> 00:42:55,358
Why were you drinking?

315
00:42:58,207 --> 00:42:59,879
You know it Pushpa

316
00:43:00,887 --> 00:43:03,196
Anyway, as long as you're with me,
I'll never drink

317
00:43:04,967 --> 00:43:06,002
Really?

318
00:43:28,207 --> 00:43:33,884
"The moon, you and I..."

319
00:43:35,007 --> 00:43:37,885
"I wish we could walk together..."

320
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:41,365
"like three travellers in love"

321
00:44:09,527 --> 00:44:13,884
"The night's spell is working"

322
00:44:16,207 --> 00:44:18,038
"May no desires well up"

323
00:44:20,047 --> 00:44:21,878
"May no fragrance seduce"

324
00:44:25,527 --> 00:44:29,361
"The night's spell is working"

325
00:44:30,527 --> 00:44:32,279
"Now that you are here..."

326
00:44:32,407 --> 00:44:33,886
"May there be..."

327
00:44:34,087 --> 00:44:36,396
"No distance between us"

328
00:44:37,207 --> 00:44:40,199
"I wish we could walk together..."

329
00:44:40,527 --> 00:44:43,883
"like three travellers in love..."

330
00:44:44,407 --> 00:44:47,365
"The moon, you and I"

331
00:45:12,007 --> 00:45:15,886
"I wish I could have no control
over my senses"

332
00:45:18,407 --> 00:45:20,875
"May no desires well up"

333
00:45:22,007 --> 00:45:23,998
"May no fragrance seduce"

334
00:45:27,887 --> 00:45:31,880
"I wish I could have no control
over my senses"

335
00:45:32,927 --> 00:45:35,885
"I wish I don't lose my life..."

336
00:45:36,407 --> 00:45:38,875
"When destination is at hand"

337
00:45:39,527 --> 00:45:42,200
"I wish we could walk together..."

338
00:45:42,887 --> 00:45:45,879
"like three travellers in love..."

339
00:45:46,887 --> 00:45:49,879
"The moon, you and I"

340
00:46:17,567 --> 00:46:21,321
- Mummy, you didn't go for a stroll.
- I had a severe headache.

341
00:46:22,447 --> 00:46:25,359
Why didn't you say so?
I'll massage your head

342
00:46:26,407 --> 00:46:28,887
- Never mind. It's gone now.
- Then go to town. Take Dinu along

343
00:46:29,207 --> 00:46:30,487
- Dinu, escort Mummy.
- All right

344
00:46:30,887 --> 00:46:33,879
I know, you want to get rid of me

345
00:46:34,527 --> 00:46:37,883
Welcome Pushpa, look who's here.

346
00:46:38,327 --> 00:46:39,362
Daddy!

347
00:46:40,327 --> 00:46:44,878
My daughter looks so thin.
Don't you feed her properly.

348
00:46:45,407 --> 00:46:48,205
Look at this.

349
00:46:49,887 --> 00:46:51,878
Hello mister, how are you?

350
00:46:58,407 --> 00:47:00,875
- How about some tea?
- Can't I have something to eat?

351
00:47:01,007 --> 00:47:05,205
- Of course.
- Get some sweets. And hot fries

352
00:47:06,207 --> 00:47:07,879
I'm famished

353
00:47:13,087 --> 00:47:19,356
- Dwarka, what news of your school?
- Being built. It's monsoons now

354
00:47:19,527 --> 00:47:21,882
So the work is stopped.
I'll go back and get started again

355
00:47:23,447 --> 00:47:26,883
- So what do you do?
- Isn't music enough?

356
00:47:27,327 --> 00:47:32,879
Doesn't fill the stomach, does it?
Let me try for myself

357
00:47:34,327 --> 00:47:36,887
- Daddy.
- It's the truth, dear.

358
00:47:39,127 --> 00:47:43,882
Find something decent to do. People
won't give their daughters to musicians

359
00:47:44,007 --> 00:47:48,364
- Then how did you found your wife?
- Well, she's your aunt, you know

360
00:47:51,887 --> 00:47:56,517
- Your father runs a prosperous business.
- I don't want to get involved

361
00:47:56,927 --> 00:48:00,203
- Then find yourself a job.
- I don't want to do job either

362
00:48:00,527 --> 00:48:02,518
Then you'll end up a labourer

363
00:48:50,567 --> 00:48:56,881
So your old friend Dwarkadas wants
your son for his daughter

364
00:48:57,047 --> 00:49:01,279
- Must you ask for her?
- We decided that already

365
00:49:01,407 --> 00:49:03,204
I see!

366
00:49:04,047 --> 00:49:08,882
- But you see, my son is wayward.
- Have you forgotten what you were?

367
00:49:09,567 --> 00:49:12,365
- So it's final, isn't it?
- You want it in writing?

368
00:49:13,047 --> 00:49:18,519
- So when is the wedding?
- Let's leave dates to the priests

369
00:49:19,127 --> 00:49:21,527
There's a limit to how much
I can tolerate. I can't live here

370
00:49:22,367 --> 00:49:26,360
- I knew you'd say this.
- Why not? How long am I to put up...

371
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:29,087
with sarcasm and insult? Were you
in my place, what would you do?

372
00:49:29,407 --> 00:49:33,286
I wouldn't have minded my father.
He's always joking with everyone

373
00:49:33,447 --> 00:49:35,881
And everyone is making fun of me!

374
00:49:38,327 --> 00:49:40,204
Including me?

375
00:49:42,407 --> 00:49:44,398
I'm not talking about you, Pushpa

376
00:49:46,887 --> 00:49:51,199
No more this house for me.
I'm going to Bombay

377
00:49:56,927 --> 00:49:59,316
How long will you keep on
stopping me, Pushpa?

378
00:50:02,007 --> 00:50:05,522
So long as I can, so long
as I'm destined

379
00:50:07,047 --> 00:50:08,047
Destiny!

380
00:50:09,327 --> 00:50:14,003
Raju, promise me you won't leave!
Promise me, Raju!

381
00:50:15,887 --> 00:50:17,878
How many promises?

382
00:50:20,407 --> 00:50:25,879
Raju, when the time comes,
I'll help you pack

383
00:50:26,487 --> 00:50:28,364
- Where's Pushpa?
- Must be around

384
00:50:28,887 --> 00:50:31,003
Shobha, please send Pushpa over here

385
00:50:39,327 --> 00:50:40,885
Here she is

386
00:50:41,367 --> 00:50:47,886
This is Captain Premnath.
This is Mr Mehta's son, Raju

387
00:50:51,407 --> 00:50:55,195
The other day I saw you playing at the
club. I took you for the bandmaster!

388
00:51:42,567 --> 00:51:45,365
- Daddy!
- Hurry up

389
00:51:55,047 --> 00:51:57,880
- Where is this going?
- Where it won't return from

390
00:52:01,927 --> 00:52:04,043
- Is this your final decision?
- Yes

391
00:52:06,887 --> 00:52:08,878
Get out of the way, I say!

392
00:52:22,407 --> 00:52:24,363
Then I'm not staying either

393
00:52:38,167 --> 00:52:39,885
Throw it out!

394
00:53:15,887 --> 00:53:17,878
It isn't beyond repair yet

395
00:53:18,407 --> 00:53:22,366
Raju is the only brother I have!
If he leaves, he'll never return

396
00:53:39,887 --> 00:53:41,878
Pushpa, don't you ask
me to stay back!

397
00:53:52,247 --> 00:53:58,356
If I'm leaving you, it's to bring
about the day when I'm successful

398
00:53:59,527 --> 00:54:01,358
And you'll be there with me

399
00:54:32,287 --> 00:54:34,278
- Where are you going, son?
- Silence!

400
00:54:37,887 --> 00:54:41,880
Think before you take that step!
You can never return

401
00:55:01,327 --> 00:55:03,318
Raju, my son! I won't stop you

402
00:55:03,887 --> 00:55:07,880
Only time and distance will bring
father and son closer

403
00:55:08,927 --> 00:55:13,045
But son, in a strange land, whom will
you ask for help, in times of need?

404
00:55:14,047 --> 00:55:17,881
One who is confident,
need never seek help

405
00:55:18,327 --> 00:55:21,319
Nevertheless, keep this.
This is all I have

406
00:55:21,527 --> 00:55:24,360
- I cannot take it.
- Don't refuse me, son!

407
00:55:24,967 --> 00:55:30,883
I have reared you. I too have
a right over you. I beg of you!

408
00:55:31,527 --> 00:55:33,882
- Take it.
- I don't want it

409
00:55:34,007 --> 00:55:36,202
For my sake! Take it

410
00:55:39,287 --> 00:55:42,359
Dinu Kaka, I'll remember this always

411
00:55:48,327 --> 00:55:52,320
May The Lord give you success

412
00:56:21,087 --> 00:56:24,363
- Raju! Take me with you.
- Silly

413
00:56:26,527 --> 00:56:28,882
Really Raju, without you...

414
00:56:34,127 --> 00:56:36,880
- Don't leave me, Raju.
- You even helped me to pack

415
00:56:42,927 --> 00:56:44,599
Oh, I have so much to tell you!

416
00:56:55,127 --> 00:56:57,038
I too have so much to tell you

417
00:56:58,047 --> 00:57:00,038
Raju, are you really leaving?

418
00:57:01,407 --> 00:57:03,318
Don't hold me back, Pushpa

419
00:57:03,527 --> 00:57:05,518
You won't forget me, will you?

420
00:57:05,967 --> 00:57:07,878
No distance can separate us

421
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:11,525
Raju, your...

422
00:57:12,207 --> 00:57:15,882
Keep it with you. One day, I'll come
to take it. And you too

423
00:57:41,007 --> 00:57:44,204
- That's my prey.
- Get on with it. Careful

424
00:57:48,527 --> 00:57:51,883
- You want a hotel, sir?
- Not your hotel. Move it

425
00:57:53,047 --> 00:57:56,278
In Bombay city, you're my guest.
Come on

426
00:57:56,407 --> 00:57:59,205
- Who are you?
- The biggest agent for all hotels

427
00:57:59,887 --> 00:58:01,366
Let me show you around

428
00:58:24,047 --> 00:58:30,885
In Bombay city, he's my guest.
My friend mustn't be inconvenienced

429
00:58:31,527 --> 00:58:35,361
- You know me, don't you?
- Understood

430
00:58:35,887 --> 00:58:40,881
- Your friend is my most valued guest.
- That's how we do it

431
00:58:43,047 --> 00:58:45,356
- How about taking a tour of the city?
- Yes, let's go

432
00:58:47,927 --> 00:58:51,203
Manager, make sure he gets
a clean fresh bed

433
00:58:51,527 --> 00:58:55,361
Not to forget the mosquito net.
And a hot meal when he gets back

434
00:58:56,887 --> 00:58:57,887
Cabby!

435
00:58:58,407 --> 00:59:00,875
- How about a paan?
- I don't take paan

436
00:59:01,007 --> 00:59:02,884
Just try this one

437
00:59:05,327 --> 00:59:08,319
Two sweet paans. Make sure they're
good enough to get him hooked to paan

438
00:59:09,167 --> 00:59:16,278
- In Bombay city, he's my guest.
- And you're a patron

439
00:59:16,407 --> 00:59:20,878
The paan I'm fixing for you
is going to give you a kick!

440
00:59:21,047 --> 00:59:23,880
- May you live long!
- Here's your Sargam brand paan

441
00:59:24,327 --> 00:59:27,876
- Sargam brand?
- Yes. Haven't you noticed...

442
00:59:28,007 --> 00:59:31,886
- the name of my shop?
- Tan Sen Paan Company

443
00:59:32,247 --> 00:59:36,877
An ancestor of mine used to make paan
for the legendary music maestro Tan Sen

444
00:59:37,047 --> 00:59:40,881
Imagine this! Were it not for paan,
would he ever have been able...

445
00:59:41,007 --> 00:59:47,879
to compose such great music? Nor would
he ever have had a fan in Emperor Akbar

446
00:59:48,367 --> 00:59:53,361
That's the origin of the Sargam paan,
once the favourite of maestro Tan Sen

447
00:59:53,927 --> 00:59:59,877
This is providential! He's a musician
too. He'll need your paan

448
01:00:01,967 --> 01:00:04,276
I am fortunate to have met you!

449
01:00:04,407 --> 01:00:09,356
Incidentally, thanks to music in
my genes, I too know a bit of music

450
01:00:09,887 --> 01:00:12,879
Should you have the time,
we could exchange notes

451
01:00:13,287 --> 01:00:14,879
- Two Rupees.
- Two?

452
01:00:15,047 --> 01:00:18,881
I also sell stuff worth two pence.
I knew you when I saw you

453
01:00:19,087 --> 01:00:23,877
That's why I gave you the Sargam brand.
Maestros pay me as much as 50 for one!

454
01:00:24,127 --> 01:00:26,880
- Two Rupees. Here you are.
- What are you doing?

455
01:00:27,407 --> 01:00:30,365
Why do you forget? In Bombay city,
you're my guest

456
01:00:31,207 --> 01:00:36,884
This gentleman is living in the hotel
across. He's also magnanimous

457
01:00:37,327 --> 01:00:42,879
If he likes your paan, he'll pay you
even a hundred bucks for a paan!

458
01:01:16,327 --> 01:01:22,357
This is the place I told you about.
This is where the most famous of...

459
01:01:22,527 --> 01:01:25,167
poets, singers and music directors
in the city spend their evenings

460
01:01:26,207 --> 01:01:29,916
Look over there. He's a famous poet

461
01:01:31,327 --> 01:01:35,366
And that man over there
is a famous singer

462
01:01:37,967 --> 01:01:41,198
The woman behind me is a great dancer!

463
01:01:42,007 --> 01:01:47,525
The man with her is Mr Shaaq
the famous music director

464
01:01:51,967 --> 01:01:53,366
- Is that Shaaq?
- Yes

465
01:01:53,527 --> 01:01:54,543
- I've heard lots about him.
- He's your key to success

466
01:01:54,567 --> 01:02:01,200
By God, he's a maestro.
What a command he has on music!

467
01:03:04,087 --> 01:03:07,875
"Earnestly I seek a beloved"

468
01:03:08,047 --> 01:03:11,881
"I swear on my life,
I didn't find one"

469
01:03:42,527 --> 01:03:47,362
"Go ahead and tell your story"

470
01:03:48,407 --> 01:03:53,879
"You will certainly find a companion,
don't stop trying"

471
01:04:03,927 --> 01:04:07,363
"O Heart, your garden
is not in bloom..."

472
01:04:07,887 --> 01:04:10,879
"Since Spring's not in as yet"

473
01:04:12,127 --> 01:04:15,278
"Earnestly I seek a beloved"

474
01:04:15,407 --> 01:04:19,878
"I swear on my life,
I didn't find one"

475
01:04:33,007 --> 01:04:37,876
"O Heart, paint your miseries"

476
01:04:39,407 --> 01:04:44,879
"Let not your lamp stop burning"

477
01:04:57,327 --> 01:04:59,124
"Play on the music, my love"

478
01:04:59,287 --> 01:05:01,198
"No one in this world..."

479
01:05:01,327 --> 01:05:03,887
"Ever found a salve"

480
01:05:05,527 --> 01:05:07,518
"Earnestly I seek a beloved"

481
01:05:09,127 --> 01:05:12,881
"I swear on my life,
I didn't find one"

482
01:05:35,887 --> 01:05:40,199
"If not pearls, collect tears"

483
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:46,881
"It is your desire to amass"

484
01:05:59,887 --> 01:06:03,357
"Even if you haven't
found happiness..."

485
01:06:03,527 --> 01:06:06,405
"You have gathered
enough sorrows"

486
01:06:08,047 --> 01:06:11,198
"Earnestly I seek a beloved"

487
01:06:11,447 --> 01:06:15,884
"I swear on my life,
I didn't find one"

488
01:06:51,887 --> 01:06:54,355
Hello there!

489
01:06:55,007 --> 01:06:56,360
Hi! What are you doing there?

490
01:06:56,527 --> 01:07:00,520
Your Sargam brand paan
is waiting for you!

491
01:07:01,887 --> 01:07:04,879
Where are you off to so early
in the day, bag and baggage?

492
01:07:06,007 --> 01:07:11,877
Here, have a Sargam brand.
You'll feel nice

493
01:07:12,047 --> 01:07:14,880
- Not now.
- Why not?

494
01:07:15,007 --> 01:07:20,365
You like music. And thanks to Tan Sen,
I'm a maestro too.

495
01:07:20,527 --> 01:07:22,882
Have a paan. And let's
exchange some notes.

496
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:24,281
No, not now. Some other time

497
01:07:24,407 --> 01:07:28,878
What's up? You won't have a paan,
you won't even exchange notes

498
01:07:29,327 --> 01:07:32,364
Tell me, is it something serious?
Now don't be shy

499
01:07:32,527 --> 01:07:37,885
- It's nothing.
- Are you missing folks back at home?

500
01:07:38,007 --> 01:07:39,884
Or is Bombay too much for you?

501
01:07:41,207 --> 01:07:44,040
Look, we're both music lovers

502
01:07:44,327 --> 01:07:49,879
What's life if you and I can't help
each other? Tell me. Don't hesitate

503
01:07:50,327 --> 01:07:55,879
I might be a poor, uneducated oaf.
But I'm human too. You must tell me

504
01:07:56,087 --> 01:08:02,196
The man who was with me last night
cleaned me out

505
01:08:02,407 --> 01:08:03,886
Cleaned you out?

506
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:07,044
No problem

507
01:08:07,287 --> 01:08:13,362
I say, it happens in Bombay. A man's
disposition isn't written on his face

508
01:08:13,527 --> 01:08:20,877
I know no one in this city. But your
sympathy gives me the courage to ask...

509
01:08:21,886 --> 01:08:23,877
Yes, go on

510
01:08:24,127 --> 01:08:26,038
I was wondering if I could
pawn my suitcase...

511
01:08:26,407 --> 01:08:31,356
and my clothes for 10 Rupees

512
01:08:33,367 --> 01:08:35,881
Understood!

513
01:08:37,527 --> 01:08:42,885
Here, keep 20, and push on.
Keep your suitcase

514
01:08:45,966 --> 01:08:47,957
You don't know how deeply
you have obliged me

515
01:08:48,527 --> 01:08:53,362
How can one man oblige another?
Here, have your paan

516
01:08:54,087 --> 01:08:58,877
And put a smile on your face.
You're handsome, you know

517
01:08:59,006 --> 01:09:02,362
- Keep the suitcase.
- No. Don't ask me to do that

518
01:09:02,527 --> 01:09:06,315
I mean, I have to go around.
I can't carry it everywhere

519
01:09:07,207 --> 01:09:10,279
That's another thing.
Put it away

520
01:09:10,407 --> 01:09:14,878
Make sure you come back for it.
But someday, you must hear me sing

521
01:09:15,207 --> 01:09:20,884
I've written songs good enough
for maestro to take notice

522
01:12:30,407 --> 01:12:37,882
What a fellow! Does he take the
Tan Sen Paan Company for the poorhouse?

523
01:12:38,047 --> 01:12:41,881
I'll throw him out if you want.

524
01:12:42,087 --> 01:12:45,363
Must you always get worked up?

525
01:12:45,647 --> 01:12:47,524
Wait, let me wake him up

526
01:12:54,047 --> 01:12:56,880
- You...?
- Oh... it's you!

527
01:12:57,887 --> 01:13:02,278
Your shop was shut by the time
I got back. So I slept here

528
01:13:02,407 --> 01:13:08,357
I'm not about to let you sleep out
here. Hey, get a special tea

529
01:13:09,007 --> 01:13:11,885
- Put more milk.
- You have my suitcase

530
01:13:12,087 --> 01:13:16,877
Sure. It's right here.
Go and get the suitcase

531
01:13:17,087 --> 01:13:21,877
No, I want to sell my clothes
to pay you back

532
01:13:22,087 --> 01:13:26,365
What do you mean? Oh, I get it now

533
01:13:32,527 --> 01:13:36,884
Go and clean the room upstairs.
And tell the restaurant...

534
01:13:37,047 --> 01:13:40,881
- to have his food sent up twice a day.
- But Shankar...

535
01:13:41,007 --> 01:13:42,884
No buts

536
01:13:45,407 --> 01:13:48,877
In Bombay city, good folks
like you are rare

537
01:13:49,607 --> 01:13:56,524
If it pleases you to praise me,
go on. But shall I tell you something?

538
01:13:57,407 --> 01:13:59,875
Someday, you must hear me sing

539
01:14:02,047 --> 01:14:03,878
I will

540
01:14:13,047 --> 01:14:18,519
- Can I have some money, Shankar?
- Why not? For you I'd stake my life

541
01:14:19,047 --> 01:14:21,880
- Someday, you must hear me sing.
- I will

542
01:14:33,007 --> 01:14:34,007
Stop.

543
01:14:35,887 --> 01:14:36,887
Listen

544
01:14:39,367 --> 01:14:40,880
I'm talking to you

545
01:14:43,927 --> 01:14:46,043
- You...?
- Do you live here?

546
01:14:46,327 --> 01:14:51,276
- On the first floor. A small room.
- I'm lucky to have found you

547
01:14:51,887 --> 01:14:55,197
I'll surely come over sometime

548
01:14:56,887 --> 01:14:58,366
Goodbye
- Goodbye

549
01:14:59,207 --> 01:15:03,883
- Excuse me, I don't know your name.
- I'm called Raju

550
01:15:05,407 --> 01:15:09,286
Raju? Couldn't have been better.
See you. Let's go

551
01:15:20,527 --> 01:15:25,885
- Don't you know who she is?
- I think I met her at a recording

552
01:15:27,047 --> 01:15:31,518
- Who is she?
- Famous singer. Miss Butterfly!

553
01:15:33,127 --> 01:15:36,358
- Is that so?
- And it's interesting!

554
01:16:17,087 --> 01:16:18,202
Beautiful

555
01:16:22,247 --> 01:16:27,196
- I didn't know you sing so well.
- I hum a few lines

556
01:16:27,927 --> 01:16:33,206
No, this is something new.
People are fed up of old styles

557
01:16:34,327 --> 01:16:39,355
People will start swaying
to your tunes. I'm sure of it

558
01:16:42,287 --> 01:16:47,884
I've spoken about you at the music
company. I'd like to sing with you

559
01:16:48,047 --> 01:16:49,878
Thanks a lot

560
01:16:52,087 --> 01:16:57,878
- But there's a condition.
- Condition? What condition?

561
01:16:59,887 --> 01:17:03,880
You will call me by my first name.
And may I also call you by first name?

562
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:06,880
Only that?
Is that so difficult?

563
01:17:12,327 --> 01:17:13,885
It isn't easy either

564
01:17:18,327 --> 01:17:23,196
- Mr Raju, how can I help you?
- Music is a hobby for me

565
01:17:23,527 --> 01:17:28,885
- Nice hobby. Where are you from?
- Shimla. But in England...

566
01:17:29,007 --> 01:17:31,362
- I studied music for two years.
- Very good

567
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:36,200
- But over here, it's traditional music.
- Capable people like you...

568
01:17:36,327 --> 01:17:39,876
- can change the trend. If you wish.
- My wish has little to do with it

569
01:17:40,887 --> 01:17:46,200
It all happens in time.
The new always replaces the old

570
01:17:46,927 --> 01:17:49,885
If you really have the talent,
you will be appreciated

571
01:17:50,487 --> 01:17:54,878
The other day, you were tapping
your foot to his music

572
01:17:55,527 --> 01:17:56,880
- Really?
- Yes

573
01:17:57,367 --> 01:18:01,883
Earnestly I seek a companion.
I swear, I couldn't find one

574
01:18:03,287 --> 01:18:07,883
You sang it really well.
It still resonates in my mind

575
01:18:08,247 --> 01:18:10,363
- Where have you been all this time?
- I don't drink

576
01:18:10,927 --> 01:18:14,886
Why not? A promise to keep?

577
01:18:15,207 --> 01:18:17,198
No, please excuse me

578
01:18:18,047 --> 01:18:20,880
Just wait for a heartbreak.
Then you'll start drinking

579
01:18:21,007 --> 01:18:22,884
Anyway, I'm drinking

580
01:18:24,127 --> 01:18:27,881
I'll do what I can for you.
If you are capable...

581
01:18:28,327 --> 01:18:31,205
you'll surely succeed.
To you!

582
01:19:02,007 --> 01:19:05,443
"Who has seen a tomorrow?"

583
01:19:06,087 --> 01:19:08,078
"I've given my heart to you"

584
01:19:12,567 --> 01:19:18,881
- Whatever you say, our Raju sings well.
- I always said so

585
01:19:19,207 --> 01:19:23,200
- But you...
- Not I. His father

586
01:19:25,367 --> 01:19:28,882
What he says is right too.

587
01:19:30,207 --> 01:19:34,200
Music may be a hobby. Not profession

588
01:19:39,047 --> 01:19:41,880
You don't like talking sense?

589
01:19:42,527 --> 01:19:45,883
What's your problem?
Both the families are well-off

590
01:19:46,287 --> 01:19:50,360
But it's the responsibilities
after marriage that makes a man

591
01:19:51,047 --> 01:19:52,878
Still, if Raju has any problems

592
01:20:00,887 --> 01:20:04,277
Here comes the father of the man
we've been talking about

593
01:20:04,527 --> 01:20:05,880
Welcome!

594
01:20:07,887 --> 01:20:10,037
- I was waiting for you
- How are you?

595
01:20:11,047 --> 01:20:13,277
You're getting fatter.
How is your wife?

596
01:20:13,407 --> 01:20:14,407
- Fine.
- Where is she?

597
01:20:14,527 --> 01:20:16,882
- Must be in the kitchen.
- Tell her I'm here

598
01:20:17,047 --> 01:20:23,202
- Look who's here! Rustle up some tea.
- Tea? What about dinner?

599
01:20:23,327 --> 01:20:27,036
Sure! Let's organise this.
Pushpa, get cracking

600
01:20:27,367 --> 01:20:30,882
- Get some sweets too.
- So you still have the habit?

601
01:20:33,207 --> 01:20:34,879
Letter for you

602
01:20:36,327 --> 01:20:37,327
- How is your wife?
- Fine

603
01:20:37,927 --> 01:20:40,885
Here comes her letters.
You better organise the dinner

604
01:20:43,087 --> 01:20:47,877
- Two tickets to the cinema! Let's go.
- Thanks, but I can't come

605
01:20:49,407 --> 01:20:51,204
Daddy is inside

606
01:21:01,407 --> 01:21:03,875
- Please be seated.
- I have two tickets to the cinema

607
01:21:05,207 --> 01:21:06,879
Please excuse me

608
01:21:10,207 --> 01:21:13,882
So what brings you here
all of a sudden?

609
01:21:16,207 --> 01:21:17,526
You could've cabled

610
01:21:17,887 --> 01:21:20,879
Anyway, now that you're here,
let's finalise the wedding date

611
01:21:30,887 --> 01:21:33,355
"They say that the wait
is worth it's while"

612
01:21:34,407 --> 01:21:36,875
"You won't have to wait
much longer"

613
01:21:37,887 --> 01:21:40,526
"I'm trying my best to get over
to Ambala at the soonest..."

614
01:21:40,887 --> 01:21:42,878
"To bring you and my mouth organ
to Bombay"

615
01:21:54,887 --> 01:21:57,355
The question of my son marrying
your daughter doesn't arise!

616
01:21:57,967 --> 01:22:02,882
How can this be? My daughter
has waited all along for Raju

617
01:22:03,247 --> 01:22:07,877
She's as much your daughter as she's
mine. I won't let her life be ruined

618
01:22:08,327 --> 01:22:12,366
What are you saying Mehta? There isn't
someone like Raju in this whole world!

619
01:22:14,127 --> 01:22:20,282
Without doubt. That wastrel
has brought me to such shame!

620
01:22:20,407 --> 01:22:23,524
And you expect me to let him
marry Pushpa? Never!

621
01:22:24,407 --> 01:22:28,036
The burden of responsibilities
will change him

622
01:22:28,327 --> 01:22:31,876
Will he ever change? If he marries,
he'll marry a crooner or a dancer

623
01:22:32,047 --> 01:22:36,882
- Must you talk ill of your own son?
- Not son. My enemy!

624
01:22:37,087 --> 01:22:41,205
I severed all relationships the day
he left home. For me, he's dead!

625
01:22:41,887 --> 01:22:43,878
- What's all this noise?
- A procession?

626
01:23:10,047 --> 01:23:15,201
Good news, Raju!
I'm scoring music for a film!

627
01:23:16,047 --> 01:23:18,880
- Congratulations, Mr Shah!
- Congratulations to you too

628
01:23:19,127 --> 01:23:21,880
- You've become a music director too.
- I...?

629
01:23:23,887 --> 01:23:27,516
Four films. I'll score for two.
You will score for two

630
01:23:28,047 --> 01:23:29,878
If you refuse, I'll refuse too

631
01:23:32,527 --> 01:23:34,358
But Mr Shah, you...?

632
01:23:36,367 --> 01:23:38,039
I'm obliged!

633
01:23:40,087 --> 01:23:44,877
Obligations? Between men?
Forget it

634
01:23:45,047 --> 01:23:46,878
Let's get cracking

635
01:23:54,167 --> 01:23:57,045
I... don't understand

636
01:23:57,327 --> 01:23:59,522
Do I need to explain?

637
01:24:16,407 --> 01:24:18,398
Will you see if the flower girl
is still around?

638
01:24:29,527 --> 01:24:32,883
- Shankar...
- At your command, my Lord!

639
01:24:33,087 --> 01:24:35,885
You'll be happy to hear that
I'm in films

640
01:24:36,887 --> 01:24:39,355
- I'm moving out.
- For real?

641
01:24:39,927 --> 01:24:43,886
- I'll settle your accounts...
- If you're trying to give me...

642
01:24:44,327 --> 01:24:48,286
a heartburn, I won't let you go!
You promised to hear me sing

643
01:24:48,407 --> 01:24:51,877
- I surely will.
- That's what you say all the time

644
01:24:52,207 --> 01:24:54,198
But you never listen!
If not today...

645
01:24:54,407 --> 01:24:57,365
- we're friends no more!
- All right, sing

646
01:24:57,527 --> 01:25:02,885
- Won't you make a paan for me?
- Sure. But my guru wrote this

647
01:25:03,047 --> 01:25:05,880
I composed it

648
01:25:21,887 --> 01:25:26,881
"There's someone for company"

649
01:25:27,407 --> 01:25:31,878
"And meetings everyday"

650
01:25:34,127 --> 01:25:38,882
"She is his love,
and we are mere pastime"

651
01:25:40,367 --> 01:25:42,881
"Come off it"

652
01:25:43,687 --> 01:25:46,884
"Why must you..."

653
01:25:47,287 --> 01:25:50,882
"Cook up stories?"

654
01:26:13,967 --> 01:26:16,879
"Your dull face..."

655
01:26:19,287 --> 01:26:22,882
"And your unkempt hair..."

656
01:26:24,207 --> 01:26:26,357
"Reveal..."

657
01:26:26,967 --> 01:26:30,198
"Your miserable state"

658
01:26:37,887 --> 01:26:40,879
"Don't hide your love..."

659
01:26:41,327 --> 01:26:43,887
"From me"

660
01:26:50,527 --> 01:26:53,883
"I know the truth, my dear"

661
01:26:54,007 --> 01:26:56,202
"Don't shy away"

662
01:26:59,407 --> 01:27:05,357
"Your eyes..."

663
01:27:05,887 --> 01:27:08,196
"Reveal a lot"

664
01:27:08,407 --> 01:27:11,399
"Come off it.
Why must you..."

665
01:27:11,607 --> 01:27:16,362
"Cook up stories?"

666
01:27:57,207 --> 01:27:58,879
"Upper pitch"

667
01:28:17,127 --> 01:28:18,879
Cut it

668
01:28:23,527 --> 01:28:28,885
Compare his music with mine, and
his are flowers ; mine are thorns

669
01:28:30,087 --> 01:28:32,885
And butterflies sit on flowers,
not on thorns

670
01:28:33,087 --> 01:28:39,879
Anyway, I wish him all success.
Tell me, am I talking rubbish?

671
01:28:40,327 --> 01:28:42,522
- No way.
- Make me a paan

672
01:28:42,887 --> 01:28:44,887
- I'm going up to deliver a letter.
- Make the paan

673
01:28:46,327 --> 01:28:50,366
Never mind butterflies.
Is the flower girl still around?

674
01:28:52,887 --> 01:28:58,359
Yes, she's there
- Come to me, flower maiden!

675
01:29:24,887 --> 01:29:26,878
- Any mail?
- On the table

676
01:29:34,567 --> 01:29:36,523
- No other letters?
- No

677
01:29:38,047 --> 01:29:40,038
- Could you have misplaced them?
- No

678
01:29:40,527 --> 01:29:44,042
Strange. I was expecting a reply

679
01:29:46,407 --> 01:29:50,878
- Start investigating immediately.
- Sure

680
01:29:59,407 --> 01:30:01,398
Are you punishing yourself?

681
01:30:04,887 --> 01:30:09,517
I see, a letter. Must you write
even if you don't get replies?

682
01:30:10,207 --> 01:30:12,880
Baanke, drop the letters
at the post office

683
01:30:14,007 --> 01:30:18,364
And inform my mother that
I won't be back tonight

684
01:30:22,207 --> 01:30:27,884
I'll handle my mother. But what about
the rumours about you and me?

685
01:30:28,047 --> 01:30:32,359
Ignore it. Must people be told
what's between you and me?

686
01:30:33,887 --> 01:30:35,878
It's you who is aware of it.

687
01:30:36,407 --> 01:30:39,046
But tell me, what does
she have that I haven't?

688
01:30:44,047 --> 01:30:45,878
Strange question?!

689
01:30:47,087 --> 01:30:49,885
Lots of difference, right?
She's from a respectable family

690
01:30:50,407 --> 01:30:53,877
- You love her, and you hate me.
- Who told you that I hate you?

691
01:30:54,007 --> 01:30:58,876
- But you don't love me, do you?
- You fall in love only once

692
01:30:59,047 --> 01:31:02,278
Were it true love, at least one out of
four letters would've been answered

693
01:31:02,407 --> 01:31:06,878
- She might be unwell.
- In your absence...

694
01:31:07,047 --> 01:31:11,882
- she might've fallen for someone else.
- Don't you ever say that again!

695
01:31:12,967 --> 01:31:17,358
True, I'm obliged to you for your help.
But that doesn't mean...

696
01:31:17,527 --> 01:31:19,882
you can insult me like this!
You can't ridicule my love!

697
01:31:21,567 --> 01:31:23,364
God forbid!

698
01:31:25,327 --> 01:31:27,204
Why did I have to crack such a joke?

699
01:31:28,407 --> 01:31:32,036
Are you angry? Forgive me, Raju

700
01:31:32,887 --> 01:31:35,526
- Lady, letter for you.
- I'm coming

701
01:31:37,327 --> 01:31:40,319
Raju, you've forgiven me, haven't you?

702
01:32:02,647 --> 01:32:04,365
What are you doing?

703
01:32:05,487 --> 01:32:07,364
You're late. You should go home

704
01:32:08,327 --> 01:32:11,364
Look, I hate no one.
But I love only one girl

705
01:32:12,207 --> 01:32:14,357
I don't want you to misunderstand me

706
01:32:15,047 --> 01:32:18,881
It's no use trying to lessen
the distance that separates us

707
01:32:21,207 --> 01:32:22,207
Escort her home

708
01:32:29,958 --> 01:32:31,949
No letters yet from Raju?

709
01:32:36,598 --> 01:32:43,515
How long will you wait for him?
People gossip about spinsters

710
01:32:47,518 --> 01:32:50,749
Am I now a burden for you, Mummy?

711
01:32:53,798 --> 01:33:00,954
All my life I've waited for the two
of you to grow up and get married

712
01:33:01,998 --> 01:33:06,947
But now even Mr Mehta
has written him off.

713
01:33:07,518 --> 01:33:09,509
He says your life might be ruined.

714
01:33:10,598 --> 01:33:13,158
It's better to forget him.

715
01:33:16,958 --> 01:33:20,746
Even if he forgets me, I can't forget

716
01:33:22,598 --> 01:33:24,475
If I ever marry anyone...

717
01:33:27,078 --> 01:33:30,548
Is it any use being adamant?
He doesn't even care for you

718
01:33:31,638 --> 01:33:37,952
Your father was saying that
the Captain is willing

719
01:33:40,638 --> 01:33:44,551
In that case...
I'm going to Bombay

720
01:33:46,518 --> 01:33:50,557
The Captain is a good fellow too.
Everyday he comes, hoping...

721
01:33:51,558 --> 01:33:53,947
You care for what he hopes?
What about my hopes?

722
01:33:55,598 --> 01:33:58,158
Girls from respectable families
don't talk like that

723
01:34:02,958 --> 01:34:07,349
Then strangle me, kill me!
That's be the end of it all!

724
01:34:08,398 --> 01:34:10,958
- I have only enemies!
- Why are you crying?

725
01:34:11,238 --> 01:34:14,947
Let me write to Mangaldas right away.
We'll find out about Raju

726
01:34:15,758 --> 01:34:18,556
We'll decide after we get his reply

727
01:34:20,158 --> 01:34:21,955
Happy now?

728
01:34:47,958 --> 01:34:51,155
- What paan will you have?
- I don't take paan

729
01:34:51,598 --> 01:34:57,946
- I'm looking for Rajkumar Mehta.
- Used to

730
01:34:59,158 --> 01:35:02,355
What a gem of a man!

731
01:35:02,758 --> 01:35:05,955
But get involved with a woman,
and the man is ruined!

732
01:35:06,478 --> 01:35:09,948
- What do you mean?
- See this photo?

733
01:35:10,598 --> 01:35:12,554
She's a witch!

734
01:35:13,558 --> 01:35:16,948
- I see. What's her name?
- Miss Butterfly

735
01:35:18,238 --> 01:35:20,957
- What else could her name be?
- Where does she live?

736
01:35:21,358 --> 01:35:26,557
She took Mr Raju with her.
Now she lives with him

737
01:35:26,758 --> 01:35:30,956
- Do you know his address?
- I visit him once in a while

738
01:35:31,358 --> 01:35:33,952
The house is called "Dilkhush".
It's at the corner of Warden Road

739
01:35:34,478 --> 01:35:37,948
- So are you from any music company?
- No

740
01:35:39,478 --> 01:35:41,946
- I'm a relative.
- Greetings, sir!

741
01:35:42,158 --> 01:35:45,548
Will you please remind him about me?
If he hears me sing for once...

742
01:35:45,758 --> 01:35:47,555
Move

743
01:35:51,758 --> 01:35:57,947
What a blunder! He happens to be
a relative, and I told him everything!

744
01:35:58,358 --> 01:35:59,950
What do I do now?

745
01:36:02,438 --> 01:36:05,555
- Where are you?
- Did you find Raju?

746
01:36:05,798 --> 01:36:09,154
- Just as well that I didn't find him.
- What happened?

747
01:36:10,358 --> 01:36:14,556
What was to happen? You are the one
who asked me to look him up

748
01:36:15,198 --> 01:36:19,350
- And I did what I never did in my life!
- Will you say something?

749
01:36:19,558 --> 01:36:22,550
- I had to speak to a whore!
- Whore?

750
01:36:22,758 --> 01:36:26,546
- Yes. He has kept a whore.
- Goodness!

751
01:36:27,158 --> 01:36:32,551
What else are these music types up to?
He has ruined his family name

752
01:36:32,798 --> 01:36:37,428
- If Mr Mehta hears, he'll kill himself!
- Such times...!

753
01:36:37,638 --> 01:36:41,950
The poor girl is saved! I'm writing
directly to her father, not to allow...

754
01:36:42,118 --> 01:36:44,348
this wedding to happen
under any circumstances!

755
01:36:47,358 --> 01:36:48,358
Letter

756
01:36:50,958 --> 01:36:52,755
For you

757
01:37:16,958 --> 01:37:18,949
This is a lie!

758
01:37:19,598 --> 01:37:21,554
I can't believe this!

759
01:37:24,958 --> 01:37:26,949
I'm going to Bombay
- Pushpa!

760
01:37:43,958 --> 01:37:45,357
You...?

761
01:37:46,078 --> 01:37:48,956
- Do you know me?
- Yes. I've seen your photo...

762
01:37:49,158 --> 01:37:53,356
- on the sahib's table.
- Where is he?

763
01:37:53,798 --> 01:37:55,754
Gone out with the lady

764
01:37:57,638 --> 01:37:59,549
- Who's the lady?
- His mistress

765
01:38:00,558 --> 01:38:03,550
They might've gone out, or they
could be at the Imperial Film Company

766
01:38:08,598 --> 01:38:13,956
- The film seems to be progressing well.
- It's the direction and your music

767
01:38:14,478 --> 01:38:17,356
- You still have to score four songs.
- I asked you for two weeks' leave

768
01:38:17,598 --> 01:38:19,350
- I have to go to Ambala.
- Leave?

769
01:38:20,558 --> 01:38:23,550
No! Don't talk of leave!
First the work. Then you'll get leave

770
01:38:24,358 --> 01:38:27,555
The release dates have been finalised.
And you want leave?

771
01:38:27,878 --> 01:38:29,948
Just score the music for four songs.

772
01:38:30,558 --> 01:38:32,947
Please let him have the lyrics

773
01:39:00,158 --> 01:39:03,548
Are you tense up because you couldn't
get leave to go to Ambala?

774
01:39:04,158 --> 01:39:07,548
Just thinking of her makes you so
tense? I'm here with you, am I not?

775
01:39:08,158 --> 01:39:10,547
I'll even give my life for you.
But you won't even ask me

776
01:39:11,278 --> 01:39:13,553
Just give me a chance

777
01:39:15,118 --> 01:39:18,110
Listen, if you're so depressed
what will happen to me?

778
01:39:19,798 --> 01:39:21,754
Love is a two-way traffic

779
01:40:01,358 --> 01:40:02,950
I'll be back

780
01:40:09,758 --> 01:40:10,952
Listen...

781
01:40:20,078 --> 01:40:23,548
Are you leaving? I think you're
here to meet Raju

782
01:40:24,838 --> 01:40:26,954
But we'll be late
getting home tonight

783
01:40:28,358 --> 01:40:30,553
- If you want to wait...
- What for?

784
01:40:31,958 --> 01:40:35,746
- Won't you meet him?
- I don't think it's necessary

785
01:40:38,518 --> 01:40:41,749
Coming. Goodbye

786
01:40:45,158 --> 01:40:47,956
Look at me, I'm even giving you
a send-off

787
01:40:48,798 --> 01:40:50,595
What do you mean?

788
01:40:57,958 --> 01:41:00,552
- Are you crying?
- Why should I?

789
01:41:02,198 --> 01:41:06,430
- I should be laughing.
- I'll be back in a month, silly

790
01:41:07,598 --> 01:41:09,589
Don't you ever call me silly.

791
01:41:09,958 --> 01:41:14,952
I'm fast, I'm clever

792
01:41:16,118 --> 01:41:20,953
But I'm a woman.
What can I do but cry?

793
01:41:31,238 --> 01:41:34,548
- You should be happy for me.
- Who says I'm unhappy?

794
01:41:35,158 --> 01:41:39,948
But Raju, you should consider that
I gave up everything for your sake

795
01:41:41,518 --> 01:41:45,955
And what have I got? Not for a moment
have you even looked at me lovingly

796
01:41:47,958 --> 01:41:53,954
- I respect you.
- Not respect. A woman wants love

797
01:41:56,598 --> 01:41:59,556
But can a man be forced
against his will?

798
01:42:01,558 --> 01:42:04,550
I worshipped you. Fool I was!

799
01:42:06,958 --> 01:42:11,952
Pushpa and I are childhood sweethearts.
You know that.

800
01:42:12,958 --> 01:42:15,756
I can marry no one else

801
01:42:21,958 --> 01:42:27,954
Baanke, put the luggage in the cab.
He has been ready to go for so long

802
01:43:08,238 --> 01:43:10,229
- Greetings, Mr Raju.
- What's going on?

803
01:43:10,518 --> 01:43:12,349
Pushpa is getting married

804
01:43:47,118 --> 01:43:49,154
- Let's go cabby.
- Where to?

805
01:43:50,518 --> 01:43:51,553
Station

806
01:44:04,118 --> 01:44:06,094
- Shall I keep the luggage in your room?
- Whose luggage?

807
01:44:06,118 --> 01:44:08,951
- Raju's.
- Raju? Where is he?

808
01:44:09,798 --> 01:44:11,948
- In the carriage.
- Put it in my room

809
01:44:24,558 --> 01:44:26,355
- Where's Raju?
- He left

810
01:44:26,518 --> 01:44:28,952
- Left? Where to?
- To the station

811
01:44:33,118 --> 01:44:35,154
- Get me a cab. Quick!
- Very well

812
01:45:13,118 --> 01:45:16,713
Why did she do this to me?

813
01:45:17,838 --> 01:45:18,907
Brother...

814
01:45:24,918 --> 01:45:27,307
I looked for you everywhere
at the station

815
01:45:29,518 --> 01:45:35,309
- Anything left to look for?
- You never even met me before leaving

816
01:45:38,078 --> 01:45:42,708
Have you started again?
Pushpa said, you've left it

817
01:45:45,918 --> 01:45:49,706
Tell Pushpa I've started
all over again

818
01:45:53,598 --> 01:45:58,308
- Is the wedding over?
- I don't know. I was looking for you

819
01:46:00,038 --> 01:46:04,714
I could've done
nothing to stop...

820
01:46:04,878 --> 01:46:06,709
this from happening

821
01:46:07,278 --> 01:46:10,714
- Was there any need?
- I was helpless

822
01:46:12,118 --> 01:46:15,315
And you never even wrote me a letter.

823
01:46:17,718 --> 01:46:20,710
The one I used to write to...

824
01:46:21,278 --> 01:46:24,270
- has put paid my dreams.
- Pushpa said that you stopped writing

825
01:46:24,998 --> 01:46:26,113
Lies

826
01:46:29,838 --> 01:46:34,912
But Shobha, what use is all this talk?

827
01:46:37,918 --> 01:46:41,706
- Where are you going?
- Wherever I can go

828
01:46:42,358 --> 01:46:46,715
Why don't you skip this train?
At least meet mother.

829
01:46:47,718 --> 01:46:49,709
I'll call her over.

830
01:46:50,198 --> 01:46:52,189
She still pines for you

831
01:46:54,318 --> 01:46:56,707
In this world, everyone is pining

832
01:46:57,918 --> 01:47:03,709
Memories and memories

833
01:47:06,558 --> 01:47:10,870
Raju, I beg of you,
meet Mummy before you leave

834
01:47:12,918 --> 01:47:18,709
No point meeting anyone anymore.
Everyone is celebrating my ruination

835
01:47:28,278 --> 01:47:30,269
Give Pushpa my congratulations
on her wedding

836
01:47:38,878 --> 01:47:42,712
You received this telegram
the day before yesterday, didn't you?

837
01:47:43,358 --> 01:47:46,714
And you show it to me now?
After the wedding?

838
01:47:47,278 --> 01:47:49,314
This is so dangerous!

839
01:47:49,918 --> 01:47:54,708
She might end up a widow!

840
01:47:57,358 --> 01:48:03,706
Captain, if I stoop to your levels,
I can annul this wedding. Right now!

841
01:48:05,518 --> 01:48:10,717
- This is no time for such talk.
- Had I know his true colours...

842
01:48:10,918 --> 01:48:12,909
I would never have taken
your father's advise

843
01:48:13,238 --> 01:48:15,911
I would've married Pushpa off to Raju

844
01:48:36,358 --> 01:48:39,714
"I miss..."

845
01:48:40,238 --> 01:48:45,107
"Those intoxicating eyes"

846
01:48:45,998 --> 01:48:47,716
"Friends..."

847
01:48:47,878 --> 01:48:49,709
"Please..."

848
01:48:50,118 --> 01:48:51,710
"Hold..."

849
01:48:52,358 --> 01:48:56,112
"My hands"

850
01:49:17,598 --> 01:49:19,714
"Liquor..."

851
01:49:20,118 --> 01:49:22,712
"I never drank"

852
01:49:23,518 --> 01:49:25,713
"I am..."

853
01:49:26,998 --> 01:49:31,708
"Drunk in grief"

854
01:49:57,518 --> 01:50:01,716
"I don't know how..."

855
01:50:01,878 --> 01:50:03,709
"To rise after a fall"

856
01:50:06,598 --> 01:50:09,112
"So come..."

857
01:50:09,358 --> 01:50:12,714
"Walk with me"

858
01:50:13,518 --> 01:50:14,712
"Friends..."

859
01:50:15,118 --> 01:50:16,710
"Please..."

860
01:50:17,518 --> 01:50:19,315
"Hold..."

861
01:50:19,718 --> 01:50:22,107
"My hands"

862
01:50:22,918 --> 01:50:25,716
"I miss..."

863
01:50:26,438 --> 01:50:30,716
"Those intoxicating eyes"

864
01:50:35,718 --> 01:50:37,310
Bravo!

865
01:50:42,598 --> 01:50:44,316
Raju, come

866
01:51:05,518 --> 01:51:07,509
Here's the road that leads
to your goal

867
01:51:11,878 --> 01:51:13,709
I took women for playthings

868
01:51:14,958 --> 01:51:17,711
You looked at women as
mothers, sisters, goddesses

869
01:51:18,798 --> 01:51:20,709
I've never found love

870
01:51:21,798 --> 01:51:23,709
Not a mother's love,
nor a sister's love

871
01:51:23,998 --> 01:51:29,709
No one who would make me,
no one who could break me

872
01:51:30,918 --> 01:51:37,266
Raju, you have everything
I don't have, things I never had

873
01:51:39,518 --> 01:51:43,716
Drink. But drink to make others drunk

874
01:51:44,718 --> 01:51:48,711
Let the world drink in the ecstasy
of your poetry. Why court grief?

875
01:51:49,918 --> 01:51:52,307
The ones who make you sad,
let them suffer

876
01:51:53,958 --> 01:51:57,712
If not for your own sake, then for the
sake of grieving broken hearts...

877
01:51:58,158 --> 01:52:04,711
for the sake of the times past,
sing Raju. Sing!

878
01:53:09,918 --> 01:53:11,715
Look at this. Raju's photo

879
01:53:16,118 --> 01:53:20,714
Are you convinced that he has
earned money and reputation?

880
01:53:24,358 --> 01:53:29,307
- Isn't this why you threw him out?
- No use rubbing salt into my wounds

881
01:53:32,558 --> 01:53:38,315
- Will you accept him now?
- I don't quite know what to do

882
01:53:39,958 --> 01:53:44,907
I can forget the past.
But can Raju forget?

883
01:53:46,358 --> 01:53:50,909
He's your son after all.
Why don't you try?

884
01:53:53,718 --> 01:54:00,112
Shobha, why don't you go to Bombay
and look him up?

885
01:54:03,718 --> 01:54:05,709
Leave right away

886
01:54:30,238 --> 01:54:32,115
- Did you receive the cable?
- Yes

887
01:54:32,558 --> 01:54:37,712
We're going to Bombay to meet Raju.
Shobha is in that compartment

888
01:54:38,878 --> 01:54:40,709
You want anything from Bombay?

889
01:54:43,598 --> 01:54:45,509
What's there in Bombay for me?

890
01:54:48,838 --> 01:54:53,309
What a life. You married him, but you
haven't even spent a night together

891
01:54:54,038 --> 01:54:55,710
Let's talk about something else

892
01:54:57,358 --> 01:54:58,358
Sit

893
01:55:01,278 --> 01:55:03,109
You must've heard about my brother

894
01:55:04,358 --> 01:55:07,111
He was determined.
He has reached his goal

895
01:55:07,718 --> 01:55:11,108
Today he is a music director. Today he
has the fame, the wealth, everything!

896
01:55:12,318 --> 01:55:14,707
- A pretty wife too.
- Wife?

897
01:55:15,358 --> 01:55:19,715
But ask him, was he in such a hurry
to marry that he couldn't even find...

898
01:55:19,878 --> 01:55:22,711
a respectable girl?
Why did he marry a whore?

899
01:55:22,958 --> 01:55:26,712
- What are you saying?
- As if you know nothing?

900
01:55:28,918 --> 01:55:35,107
I'm telling you the truth. We know
nothing about this. Who told you?

901
01:55:36,718 --> 01:55:40,711
Had someone told me,
I would never have believed

902
01:55:43,838 --> 01:55:46,716
But I was destined to see it
with my own eyes

903
01:55:46,998 --> 01:55:49,717
- What do you mean?
- What it means is that...

904
01:55:51,518 --> 01:55:53,713
- he has deceived me.
- Deceived you?

905
01:55:54,998 --> 01:55:57,910
Raju has deceived you?
Or was it you who deceived him?

906
01:55:59,918 --> 01:56:03,911
Now that it's out, why should
I stay silent?

907
01:56:04,918 --> 01:56:06,715
Why did you stop replying
to his letters?

908
01:56:12,238 --> 01:56:14,308
- Was it I?
- Yes. You

909
01:56:15,238 --> 01:56:18,708
He was here. But then you were
getting married.

910
01:56:20,358 --> 01:56:22,314
And now you're blaming him...

911
01:56:22,518 --> 01:56:24,198
- to cover up for yourself?
- He came here?

912
01:56:24,358 --> 01:56:28,715
- I met him myself at the station.
- Why didn't you tell me?

913
01:56:29,918 --> 01:56:32,716
Telling you would've made
matters worse

914
01:56:36,358 --> 01:56:42,115
You were right. Your brother was right.
I'm the only one to blame

915
01:56:44,078 --> 01:56:50,916
But now, it'd be a sin for me
to even think about all that

916
01:56:54,358 --> 01:56:58,715
- You called me here to tell me all this?
- I was silent, you picked it up

917
01:57:04,718 --> 01:57:06,913
Make sure to tell your brother
that had I known...

918
01:57:07,918 --> 01:57:12,708
I would've sent a wedding gift
for his bride

919
01:57:26,518 --> 01:57:28,509
Give this back to him

920
01:57:30,718 --> 01:57:34,108
He left it with me when he was leaving

921
01:57:35,718 --> 01:57:37,515
He said...

922
01:57:38,318 --> 01:57:40,309
some day he'd come back for it and...

923
01:57:45,358 --> 01:57:47,314
That day never came

924
01:57:59,678 --> 01:58:03,307
- Whose cable?
- Be patient. I'll tell you

925
01:58:05,718 --> 01:58:08,710
It's the Captain. He's landing
in Bombay the day after tomorrow

926
01:58:09,718 --> 01:58:14,712
Pushpa, the Captain has cabled.
You're leaving for Bombay tomorrow

927
01:58:17,598 --> 01:58:18,713
Bombay?

928
01:58:23,358 --> 01:58:25,314
We're coming with you too

929
01:58:34,918 --> 01:58:38,308
- Excuse me, can I have that paper?
- Sure

930
01:58:42,358 --> 01:58:47,716
Mr Raj's photo! Didn't I
say he's a big man?

931
01:58:48,358 --> 01:58:51,111
How else would he be in the papers?

932
01:58:51,358 --> 01:58:53,110
- Look at this!
- You were right

933
01:58:53,318 --> 01:58:57,709
Let's cut this photo and preserve it.
He was a dear friend

934
01:58:57,918 --> 01:59:01,115
- Where does he live?
- Down the lane

935
01:59:01,518 --> 01:59:04,316
- Which lane?
- The lane beside his house

936
01:59:05,118 --> 01:59:07,712
- Where's that?
- Next to each other

937
01:59:08,398 --> 01:59:10,116
Get lost!

938
01:59:10,278 --> 01:59:15,716
Hey, aren't you the one
who robbed him?

939
01:59:16,118 --> 01:59:18,188
Where does he live?
I want to give his money back

940
01:59:18,398 --> 01:59:23,313
Have you hit the jackpot? Take him
upstairs and give him the address

941
01:59:24,118 --> 01:59:26,294
Where do you think you're going?
How about mincemeat for him...?

942
01:59:26,318 --> 01:59:28,309
English style!

943
02:00:04,318 --> 02:00:07,116
- How did you get here?
- I asked around

944
02:00:07,838 --> 02:00:09,908
- Why didn't you write?
- Just like that

945
02:00:11,918 --> 02:00:15,706
Oh yes, who am I after all?
What is a brother anyway?

946
02:00:16,718 --> 02:00:17,718
Don't say that Raju

947
02:00:17,918 --> 02:00:20,716
I would've come to the station myself.
Or I could've sent the car

948
02:00:22,718 --> 02:00:24,595
My mistake

949
02:00:31,158 --> 02:00:33,149
What have you done to yourself?

950
02:00:35,558 --> 02:00:37,355
I'm perfectly all right

951
02:00:41,398 --> 02:00:43,389
You know everything,
and you still ask?

952
02:00:46,518 --> 02:00:48,509
I heard you've married

953
02:00:51,518 --> 02:00:56,114
Married? Oh yes, with great fanfare!

954
02:00:56,718 --> 02:01:01,109
Everyone sang, everyone danced!

955
02:01:06,558 --> 02:01:11,712
- How have you been? How is Mummy?
- She worries herself sick for you

956
02:01:12,718 --> 02:01:16,313
And Daddy is looking for an excuse
to meet you

957
02:01:27,558 --> 02:01:29,913
Come, let me show you to your room

958
02:01:37,358 --> 02:01:42,512
Unfortunate. Her husband was sent off
to war right after the wedding

959
02:01:43,518 --> 02:01:45,509
He should be back soon.

960
02:01:47,278 --> 02:01:49,712
Anyway, if you don't mind,
can I ask you something?

961
02:01:51,238 --> 02:01:52,717
Where's your wife?

962
02:01:54,718 --> 02:01:56,515
Silly girl

963
02:01:57,358 --> 02:02:03,706
Shobha my sister, don't you realise?
I'm not one of them who get married

964
02:02:04,718 --> 02:02:06,709
I'm not really one of them

965
02:02:07,358 --> 02:02:11,715
What I suspected turns out true!
I was sure there was a misunderstanding

966
02:02:13,038 --> 02:02:16,110
- Misunderstanding? Whose?
- Pushpa

967
02:02:20,358 --> 02:02:22,110
Let's talk something else.

968
02:02:24,318 --> 02:02:27,310
Yes, its best forgotten

969
02:02:35,918 --> 02:02:38,716
Pushpa has sent back the memento
you left with her

970
02:02:40,638 --> 02:02:47,111
That story is over. Now start life
afresh. Get married

971
02:02:50,238 --> 02:02:52,115
After all this?

972
02:03:17,478 --> 02:03:20,709
- Who are you?
- Raju's sister

973
02:03:23,358 --> 02:03:25,713
- What did you say?
- Raju's sister

974
02:03:25,918 --> 02:03:30,708
I'm Shaaq. Raju's friend.
We are colleagues

975
02:03:31,358 --> 02:03:36,113
I was surprised to see you.
I've never seen a woman in this house

976
02:03:36,838 --> 02:03:39,716
- Where did Raju go?
- That's what I'd like to know

977
02:03:40,038 --> 02:03:44,509
- Then I know. He's out drinking.
- You're his friend, aren't you?

978
02:03:44,718 --> 02:03:47,710
- Why don't you stop him?
- Friendship doesn't work here

979
02:03:48,798 --> 02:03:53,110
When the heart is wounded,
man will even challenge God

980
02:03:54,038 --> 02:03:55,915
Please take me to him.
I'll talk to him

981
02:03:56,118 --> 02:04:02,114
No! There are these places where
mothers and sisters must enter

982
02:04:02,998 --> 02:04:04,909
But don' you worry.
I'll bring him back

983
02:04:07,958 --> 02:04:13,316
Oh I forgot! More than Raju or I,
you deserve to know this good news

984
02:04:13,918 --> 02:04:16,307
Raju is acclaimed as the best
music director

985
02:04:16,958 --> 02:04:19,108
A function is being organised
to felicitate him

986
02:04:19,638 --> 02:04:23,517
If you permit me, I'd like to
give him the invitation myself

987
02:04:24,558 --> 02:04:26,514
- Sure.
- See you

988
02:04:39,718 --> 02:04:41,310
- Letter? From whom?
- Pushpa

989
02:04:41,518 --> 02:04:43,509
- When did she come to Bombay?
- This morning

990
02:05:03,918 --> 02:05:05,715
Letter for Ms Pushpa

991
02:05:09,838 --> 02:05:14,309
"I've just arrived.
Come to see me if you can"

992
02:05:15,358 --> 02:05:18,350
"I'll wait for you: Pushpa"

993
02:05:31,518 --> 02:05:33,315
Good you're here in Bombay

994
02:05:34,718 --> 02:05:37,710
- Will it be the verbal lashing again?
- Forget all that, Pushpa

995
02:05:39,918 --> 02:05:44,309
Forgetting? Isn't it easier said
than done?

996
02:05:45,038 --> 02:05:51,113
Raju is suffering too.
He still thinks, you deceived him

997
02:05:51,878 --> 02:05:55,314
- Lies!
- He's getting drunk

998
02:05:56,358 --> 02:06:01,113
He's wasting his life. Without a care
for all the fame, the money, anything

999
02:06:02,278 --> 02:06:07,716
He always comes home past midnight,
and he's always drunk, senseless...

1000
02:06:07,878 --> 02:06:09,709
and he trips, he falls down the stairs!

1001
02:06:12,918 --> 02:06:17,309
Pushpa, he has no wife!

1002
02:06:18,398 --> 02:06:22,107
He has no one in this whole
wide world! Except me...

1003
02:06:24,118 --> 02:06:25,710
- and you.
- No!

1004
02:06:26,918 --> 02:06:30,308
For me, it's a sin to even
think of this!

1005
02:06:32,118 --> 02:06:36,509
If this is sin, he'd rather
drink himself to death

1006
02:06:44,718 --> 02:06:49,712
I cannot do anything...
now I can't do anything!

1007
02:08:39,718 --> 02:08:43,313
- I don't want anyone's help, Shobha.
- It's me

1008
02:08:54,918 --> 02:08:57,716
I'm seeing you after so long
you still look the same

1009
02:09:02,118 --> 02:09:04,109
Are you happy, Pushpa?

1010
02:09:06,118 --> 02:09:08,109
Congratulations on your wedding

1011
02:09:09,118 --> 02:09:14,317
I should've congratulated you long ago,

1012
02:09:15,518 --> 02:09:17,713
but I didn't have even time to think...

1013
02:09:20,358 --> 02:09:24,351
- not even time to look you up.
- Stop drinking, Raju

1014
02:09:27,278 --> 02:09:30,714
In what joy does one desert a companion
who has stood by in times of grief?

1015
02:09:32,718 --> 02:09:36,711
Let's not talk of joy and sorrow.
I haven't come to remind you of...

1016
02:09:38,718 --> 02:09:40,709
the promises you have broken.

1017
02:09:42,918 --> 02:09:44,798
All I have come to tell you
is to stop drinking.

1018
02:09:44,998 --> 02:09:48,707
And what else was it that you said?
That I have broken promises?

1019
02:09:51,918 --> 02:09:53,715
Well yes, I must've broken promises

1020
02:09:53,958 --> 02:09:56,711
Aren't promises made to be broken?

1021
02:09:57,358 --> 02:09:59,314
Else, why are letters not answered?

1022
02:09:59,478 --> 02:10:02,311
Why doesn't one wait?
Why doesn't one trust?

1023
02:10:04,518 --> 02:10:09,717
- Didn't I...?
- No. I didn't

1024
02:10:10,278 --> 02:10:13,270
And who is the one who got married
with great fanfare?

1025
02:10:14,718 --> 02:10:18,108
- Why now?
- Why Pushpa, why?

1026
02:10:21,918 --> 02:10:27,311
I too can ask lots of questions.
But I haven't the will anymore

1027
02:10:29,118 --> 02:10:31,313
All I'm here to tell you is
stop drinking, Raju

1028
02:10:34,278 --> 02:10:40,717
And give up the illusion that one
who isn't mine, is still mine?

1029
02:10:44,558 --> 02:10:49,712
What of one who isn't allowed to
live in illusions? What does she do?

1030
02:10:50,358 --> 02:10:52,314
She does what you have done to me

1031
02:10:54,838 --> 02:11:00,310
So many promises, so many oaths.
In your letters, you'd wait...

1032
02:11:00,518 --> 02:11:03,715
to be there with me on the day
I succeeded. And what comes of it?

1033
02:11:06,358 --> 02:11:10,112
Pleasure? Yes, to live
a life in grief.

1034
02:11:12,958 --> 02:11:14,914
I don't want to argue

1035
02:11:16,278 --> 02:11:18,314
But stop drinking, Raju!

1036
02:11:18,718 --> 02:11:21,312
By what right do you say that...
again and again?

1037
02:11:24,518 --> 02:11:28,716
I may not have the right anymore.
But once, you gave me the right

1038
02:11:29,358 --> 02:11:32,714
First you get married, and then
you come back to claim your right?

1039
02:11:35,958 --> 02:11:38,711
Why did you deceive me?
What was my crime?

1040
02:11:39,998 --> 02:11:42,717
Why didn't you answer my letters?
Why didn't you wait?

1041
02:11:42,918 --> 02:11:45,307
- Why didn't you trust me?
- Stop drinking, Raju!

1042
02:11:50,038 --> 02:11:51,710
Not a single question answered

1043
02:11:58,718 --> 02:12:00,709
Where have you been Pushpa?

1044
02:12:05,718 --> 02:12:07,709
What is the matter?

1045
02:12:11,918 --> 02:12:14,113
We've been expecting you for so long.
Go inside

1046
02:12:30,598 --> 02:12:35,718
Pushpa, where have you been?
I've been waiting for you

1047
02:12:38,038 --> 02:12:40,711
I had cabled you. I was expecting you
at the docks

1048
02:12:46,358 --> 02:12:49,350
Where have you been so late at night?
Where have you been?

1049
02:12:50,718 --> 02:12:52,709
At Shobha's place

1050
02:12:59,318 --> 02:13:01,115
To meet Raju?

1051
02:13:04,918 --> 02:13:08,308
I'm staying at the Taj. I'll come
to pick you up tomorrow morning

1052
02:13:15,558 --> 02:13:17,310
It's me. Captain

1053
02:13:18,718 --> 02:13:24,236
What are you doing here
so late at night?

1054
02:13:29,558 --> 02:13:30,707
Nothing

1055
02:13:31,878 --> 02:13:33,709
I just wanted to congratulate you

1056
02:13:37,398 --> 02:13:40,708
Once I called you a bandmaster.
Little did I know...

1057
02:13:40,918 --> 02:13:44,354
- It was a great favour.
- I think you didn't like it

1058
02:13:46,358 --> 02:13:48,314
Why didn't you come for my wedding?

1059
02:13:50,118 --> 02:13:53,713
Had I known your address,
I would've sent you an invitation

1060
02:13:54,718 --> 02:13:58,711
Actually, I got married in a hurry.
I didn't even get the opportunity...

1061
02:13:59,358 --> 02:14:03,715
to throw a party to celebrate. I was
ordered to go to the front immediately

1062
02:14:05,118 --> 02:14:10,715
We couldn't even go for a honeymoon.
Surely you know all that

1063
02:14:11,038 --> 02:14:15,111
I don't know anything.
Nor have I ever tried to find out

1064
02:14:16,278 --> 02:14:18,314
Didn't Pushpa tell you?

1065
02:14:21,878 --> 02:14:27,714
Your childhood friend. Surely you know
that she's the one whom I've married

1066
02:14:30,278 --> 02:14:32,269
She mentioned you often in her letters

1067
02:14:33,718 --> 02:14:38,917
I hear your sister Shobha is here. The
two of them are friends, aren't they?

1068
02:14:39,918 --> 02:14:46,710
- They must be seeing each other, right?
- Maybe. I don't know anything

1069
02:14:49,318 --> 02:14:55,507
She goes where you live,
and you know nothing?

1070
02:14:57,358 --> 02:15:03,308
- What do you mean?
- Nothing especially. But strangely...

1071
02:15:04,918 --> 02:15:08,706
you spend most of your time together,
and you claim to know nothing...

1072
02:15:08,878 --> 02:15:12,109
- beyond a childhood spent together?
- I understand what you're getting at

1073
02:15:13,798 --> 02:15:16,312
But I don't care to think...

1074
02:15:17,718 --> 02:15:22,314
or speak about what is over

1075
02:15:24,718 --> 02:15:27,312
And clearly, you suspect your wife.

1076
02:15:28,718 --> 02:15:32,711
But I'll bet that she's honest...

1077
02:15:33,558 --> 02:15:36,709
she's proud and she's
a woman of character

1078
02:15:37,118 --> 02:15:40,713
- You're getting me wrong.
- I'm dispelling your doubts

1079
02:15:42,558 --> 02:15:46,710
It's unbecoming of educated
gentlemen of your repute...

1080
02:15:46,878 --> 02:15:51,713
to accuse your wife

1081
02:15:56,718 --> 02:15:58,709
Anyway, now that you're,
please be seated

1082
02:15:59,758 --> 02:16:02,352
If you want a drink,
here's the bottle

1083
02:16:04,198 --> 02:16:05,711
And here...

1084
02:16:08,558 --> 02:16:13,313
is an invitation for tomorrow

1085
02:16:15,718 --> 02:16:17,709
Keep another

1086
02:16:48,838 --> 02:16:52,308
Strange. How can you be unhappy
about being in Bombay?

1087
02:16:56,918 --> 02:17:00,308
I am here because you called me

1088
02:17:03,118 --> 02:17:05,109
What have I to do in this city?

1089
02:17:06,317 --> 02:17:08,512
Don't you know anyone else here,
no one apart from me?

1090
02:17:19,278 --> 02:17:25,308
- Whom do you I know?
- You know Raju. Your childhood friend

1091
02:17:32,718 --> 02:17:35,312
That friendship ended
when we were children

1092
02:17:35,558 --> 02:17:40,109
But when I saw you in Shimla,
you were grown-ups

1093
02:17:40,518 --> 02:17:47,117
- What use is all this now?
- Maybe Raju doesn't think that way

1094
02:17:55,358 --> 02:17:59,112
- Did you meet Raju?
- I did. Any objections

1095
02:18:03,718 --> 02:18:05,709
Did he say anything about me?

1096
02:18:10,758 --> 02:18:12,714
- Yes.
- What?

1097
02:18:19,918 --> 02:18:21,909
He has invited you. Especially

1098
02:18:42,918 --> 02:18:46,706
- Did he have to say anything else?
- Whatever he had to say...

1099
02:18:48,718 --> 02:18:50,549
wasn't convincing enough

1100
02:18:59,598 --> 02:19:01,509
So you suspect me?

1101
02:20:29,918 --> 02:20:32,716
"I miss..."

1102
02:20:33,118 --> 02:20:37,316
"Those intoxicating eyes"

1103
02:20:37,958 --> 02:20:39,107
"Friends..."

1104
02:20:39,358 --> 02:20:40,950
"Please..."

1105
02:20:41,358 --> 02:20:42,711
"Hold..."

1106
02:20:43,358 --> 02:20:45,713
"My hands"

1107
02:21:20,358 --> 02:21:22,508
"Liquor..."

1108
02:21:22,718 --> 02:21:24,709
"I never drank"

1109
02:21:25,278 --> 02:21:28,111
"I am..."

1110
02:21:28,358 --> 02:21:32,715
"Drunk in grief"

1111
02:21:52,318 --> 02:21:54,513
"I don't know how..."

1112
02:21:54,718 --> 02:21:58,711
"To rise after a fall"

1113
02:22:00,198 --> 02:22:02,109
"So come..."

1114
02:22:02,518 --> 02:22:05,715
"Walk with me"

1115
02:22:06,238 --> 02:22:07,238
"Friends..."

1116
02:22:07,398 --> 02:22:09,309
"Please..."

1117
02:22:09,518 --> 02:22:11,315
"Hold..."

1118
02:22:11,478 --> 02:22:13,912
"My hands"

1119
02:22:14,318 --> 02:22:16,707
"I miss..."

1120
02:22:17,318 --> 02:22:21,311
"Those intoxicating eyes"

1121
02:22:40,118 --> 02:22:42,109
"Those eyes..."

1122
02:22:42,358 --> 02:22:44,713
"I still see"

1123
02:22:47,878 --> 02:22:49,709
"My wounds..."

1124
02:22:49,918 --> 02:22:53,513
"Are still young"

1125
02:23:11,718 --> 02:23:13,709
"I don't need..."

1126
02:23:14,198 --> 02:23:17,713
"A salve"

1127
02:23:19,558 --> 02:23:21,708
"What good..."

1128
02:23:21,878 --> 02:23:24,711
"Is sobriety?"

1129
02:24:00,358 --> 02:24:03,714
What have I done to harm you?
What are you punishing me for?

1130
02:24:04,358 --> 02:24:07,111
Why are you insinuating?
And by what right?

1131
02:24:08,558 --> 02:24:11,914
That right I haven't anymore.
But once, you did give me the right

1132
02:24:12,918 --> 02:24:16,308
Now that you haven't, will you
give me a bad name like this?

1133
02:24:16,998 --> 02:24:20,911
- Is it revenge? You want to ruin me?
- Not I. You have ruined me

1134
02:24:22,278 --> 02:24:26,510
Else, today you would've been with me.
I ask you, what was my crime?

1135
02:24:26,998 --> 02:24:33,710
Crime? You come here, you rise to fame ;
in the dazzle you forget your promises

1136
02:24:33,958 --> 02:24:36,711
- Is the crime mine or yours?
- Yours! But I'm suffering for it

1137
02:24:37,118 --> 02:24:40,315
Wealth, prestige, name, fame
it's all useless for me

1138
02:24:41,918 --> 02:24:47,311
What use this success, if I haven't the
one who promised to stand beside me?

1139
02:24:48,118 --> 02:24:54,717
And you used that as the excuse to
pour your heart out to my husband?

1140
02:24:55,718 --> 02:24:58,312
I'm not so lowly to discuss you
with others

1141
02:24:59,238 --> 02:25:01,334
I have told you whatever I had to say.
I'll tell you whatever I have to say

1142
02:25:01,358 --> 02:25:04,714
- It's you I'm accusing. No one else.
- And it's you I accuse!

1143
02:25:05,038 --> 02:25:07,347
Because I didn't attend your wedding?

1144
02:25:08,918 --> 02:25:12,513
Because you didn't invite me to yours

1145
02:25:14,758 --> 02:25:19,707
I couldn't have come. But I would've
sent a wedding gift for your wife

1146
02:25:19,918 --> 02:25:24,708
You should've had a more believable
alibi for marrying the Captain

1147
02:25:25,958 --> 02:25:30,315
Like "The Captain is an honourable
man and he makes a decent living"

1148
02:25:32,318 --> 02:25:35,708
You spurned love for the money?
How much is your love worth?

1149
02:25:35,958 --> 02:25:38,313
- How much did you want?
- Love for sale?

1150
02:25:38,718 --> 02:25:44,714
- So that's what the whore taught you?
- Whore? Who?

1151
02:25:47,518 --> 02:25:51,875
- The one you married.
- I married? A whore?

1152
02:25:53,358 --> 02:25:55,110
That's a lie!

1153
02:25:56,918 --> 02:25:59,638
I too thought it was a lie when
I visited Bombay before I married him

1154
02:26:00,518 --> 02:26:02,907
But I was destined to see it all
with my own eyes

1155
02:26:03,478 --> 02:26:05,309
- What did you see?
- Whatever I had heard of

1156
02:26:05,518 --> 02:26:08,112
Whatever you saw and heard was a lie!
If you came to Bombay...

1157
02:26:08,318 --> 02:26:12,311
- why did you leave without seeing me?
- What was left of it?

1158
02:26:12,798 --> 02:26:16,507
- Those promises that brought you here?
- But you had forgotten all that

1159
02:26:16,878 --> 02:26:20,712
That was my allegation.
Why didn't you answer my letters?

1160
02:26:21,838 --> 02:26:25,114
- I wrote to you. You never replied.
- I wrote to you everyday

1161
02:26:27,918 --> 02:26:29,715
- You never replied.
- Didn't I?

1162
02:26:29,878 --> 02:26:31,494
- You didn't!
- Didn't I write that I love you?

1163
02:26:31,518 --> 02:26:32,678
- No!
- Didn't I wait for you?

1164
02:26:32,718 --> 02:26:33,912
- No!
- Denials and denials!

1165
02:26:34,118 --> 02:26:36,916
Why did I go to Ambala?
To see with my own eyes, my ruination?

1166
02:26:38,518 --> 02:26:43,308
If you believed me, my love for you,
you could've stopped my wedding

1167
02:26:43,598 --> 02:26:47,307
- If you believed me, you'd never marry.
- I was helpless

1168
02:26:48,158 --> 02:26:50,308
- You were the first to marry.
- You, or I?

1169
02:26:50,718 --> 02:26:52,515
- You.
- So I deceived you?

1170
02:26:52,638 --> 02:26:54,934
- Was it I who lied?
- Was it I who never had faith in you?

1171
02:26:54,958 --> 02:26:57,094
- Was it I who broke promises?
- Wasn't I the one who waited?

1172
02:26:57,118 --> 02:26:59,494
- Wasn't I the one who remained true?
- If you've remained true, tell me...

1173
02:26:59,518 --> 02:27:02,715
where is gone the joy of our lives?
I have reached my goal...

1174
02:27:03,918 --> 02:27:08,116
yet my goal is so far removed from me,
I have nothing left

1175
02:27:09,958 --> 02:27:14,713
And you have it all. The happiness,
a family, everything

1176
02:27:19,958 --> 02:27:22,313
If your allegations are true...

1177
02:27:24,558 --> 02:27:28,312
not all the waters in the seas
will cleanse my heart...

1178
02:27:30,318 --> 02:27:32,707
nowhere in the world have I to turn to,
to hide my shame

1179
02:27:33,198 --> 02:27:38,511
I saw you with Ms Butterfly.
I misunderstood you

1180
02:27:39,038 --> 02:27:45,307
I left without seeing you.
Oh, how grave a punishment...

1181
02:27:46,558 --> 02:27:50,312
for so little a mistake. I couldn't
give you the only dream you had

1182
02:27:51,518 --> 02:27:55,113
You have reached what you set out for.
And I'm not here to be with you

1183
02:28:13,718 --> 02:28:16,915
Whatever had to happen has happened.
Now, I'm happy if you're happy

1184
02:28:18,318 --> 02:28:22,709
You're someone's wife, you're raising
a family. You do your duty, I do mine

1185
02:28:24,038 --> 02:28:26,916
If there's anything, ever, I shall
always try to make you happy

1186
02:28:29,878 --> 02:28:32,318
You may have gone away from me.
But you will always be with me

1187
02:28:33,118 --> 02:28:38,112
Because I was in love with you,
I still am, and I'll always be in love

1188
02:28:41,998 --> 02:28:43,989
So my suspicions turn out to be true!

1189
02:28:44,998 --> 02:28:46,716
So this is the gentleman that you are

1190
02:28:47,318 --> 02:28:49,854
- What an example of a woman's fidelity!
- There's no worse an aspersion...

1191
02:28:49,878 --> 02:28:53,314
than a character assassination.
Especially for a woman

1192
02:28:53,598 --> 02:28:56,715
Are you arguing her case again?
The two of you have deceived me

1193
02:28:57,278 --> 02:28:59,712
- You've got it wrong.
- That's what I'm here to decide

1194
02:29:00,758 --> 02:29:03,478
No mind clouded with suspicion,
no conscience torn with allegation...

1195
02:29:03,718 --> 02:29:07,313
no hand holding a gun has ever been
able to arrive at a decision

1196
02:29:07,598 --> 02:29:10,317
- A decision isn't arrived at. It's done!
- Then decide

1197
02:29:11,118 --> 02:29:14,315
If my blood can wash your suspicions or
exonerate Pushpa of false allegations...

1198
02:29:14,518 --> 02:29:19,717
then shoot! But don't you forget that
better than regretting...

1199
02:29:19,878 --> 02:29:22,915
once the truth outs,
is knowing the truth beforehand

1200
02:29:23,318 --> 02:29:29,712
What more truth? I just heard you say
you were, are and will be in love!

1201
02:29:30,318 --> 02:29:35,108
I haven't lied. Love is more emotion
than passion. I'll tell you in your face

1202
02:29:35,358 --> 02:29:38,350
I have always lived Pushpa.
I always will

1203
02:29:38,678 --> 02:29:39,713
Shut up!

1204
02:30:37,878 --> 02:30:42,315
No need for worry. She's in a state
of shock. She'll recover soon

1205
02:30:42,918 --> 02:30:44,715
- How is Pushpa?
- Fine

1206
02:30:45,198 --> 02:30:46,711
Excuse me

1207
02:30:48,838 --> 02:30:51,716
- Please stay beside Pushpa.
- I must look up Raju

1208
02:30:51,918 --> 02:30:56,548
Not necessary. Shankar is with him.
He'll come here after his dressing

1209
02:30:57,238 --> 02:30:59,832
Lord help my daughter's husband!

1210
02:31:02,598 --> 02:31:05,908
Whatever God wills happens.
Whatever had to happen has happened

1211
02:31:06,518 --> 02:31:10,716
I've tried my best to convince Mehta.
But he's unrelenting

1212
02:31:11,718 --> 02:31:14,710
What use thinking about fate?

1213
02:31:15,518 --> 02:31:17,509
But a wrong can be set right

1214
02:31:17,798 --> 02:31:22,110
- What can be done now?
- If you want it, everything

1215
02:31:23,238 --> 02:31:28,312
You are also in a state of shock.
This is no time to discuss this

1216
02:31:28,958 --> 02:31:30,710
But neither can I stay mum

1217
02:31:30,918 --> 02:31:37,107
Not necessarily, whatever you elders do
is always right. Times are changing

1218
02:31:37,958 --> 02:31:41,314
Everything is changing.
But you won't change

1219
02:31:41,838 --> 02:31:46,116
Man cannot ignore changing times.
Society cannot oppress people

1220
02:31:47,118 --> 02:31:50,315
Keep lovers apart, and you destroy
their hopes and aspirations

1221
02:31:50,718 --> 02:31:57,510
Break the chains of social tradition.
Have the courage to set an example

1222
02:32:00,798 --> 02:32:05,314
- That is all I request you.
- Whatever you've said is right

1223
02:32:05,998 --> 02:32:10,310
- This is what should happen.
- You'll be leaving in a while

1224
02:32:11,118 --> 02:32:13,109
I'll send Raju as soon as he recovers

1225
02:32:48,678 --> 02:32:49,793
Raju!

1226
02:32:50,798 --> 02:32:51,913
Dear.
